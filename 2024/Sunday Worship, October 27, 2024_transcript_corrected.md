[0.00 → 4.04] To leave the God I love
[4.04 → 7.06] Here's my heart, Lord
[7.06 → 9.72] Take and seal it
[9.72 → 13.96] Seal it for Thy courts above
[13.96 → 17.62] Here's my heart, Lord
[17.62 → 20.36] Take and seal it
[20.36 → 25.08] Seal it for Thy courts above
[30.00 → 53.76] Water you turned into wine
[53.76 → 58.30] Open the eyes of the blind
[58.30 → 61.30] There's no one like you
[61.30 → 66.26] None like you
[66.26 → 72.00] Into the darkness you shine
[72.00 → 76.80] Out of the ashes we rise
[76.80 → 79.30] There's no one like you
[79.98 → 85.38] None like you
[85.38 → 89.22] Our God is greater
[89.22 → 91.64] Our God is stronger
[91.64 → 96.30] God you are higher than any other
[96.30 → 98.76] Our God is healer
[98.76 → 100.66] Awesome in power
[100.66 → 101.98] Our God
[101.98 → 104.98] Our God
[104.98 → 117.72] Into the darkness you shine
[117.72 → 121.98] Out of the ashes we rise
[121.98 → 124.98] There's no one like you
[124.98 → 126.98] There's no one like you
[126.98 → 128.98] None like you
[128.98 → 134.90] Our God is greater

[140.98 → 143.98] Our God is healer
[143.98 → 145.94] Awesome in power
[145.94 → 146.94] Our God
[146.94 → 147.94] Our God
[147.94 → 148.94] Our God
[148.94 → 149.94] Our God
[149.94 → 152.94] Our God is greater

[160.94 → 161.94] Our God
[161.94 → 162.94] Our God
[162.94 → 163.94] Our God

[164.94 → 165.94] Our God
[165.94 → 166.94] Our God
[166.94 → 167.94] Our God
[167.94 → 179.92] Our God
[179.92 → 184.78] And if God is for us
[184.78 → 203.78] ?!"
[203.78 → 208.52] Than what could stand against
[208.52 → 219.40] Than what could stand against
[219.40 → 228.80] Our God is greater, our God is stronger
[228.80 → 233.38] God, you are higher than any other
[233.38 → 237.72] Our God is healer, awesome and power
[237.72 → 241.34] Our God, our God
[241.34 → 247.08] Our God is greater, our God is stronger
[247.08 → 251.68] God, you are higher than any other
[251.68 → 256.02] Our God is healer, awesome and power
[256.02 → 260.24] Our God, our God
[260.24 → 263.70] And if our God is for us
[263.70 → 266.00] Then who could ever stop us
[266.00 → 268.28] And if our God is with us
[268.28 → 270.20] Then what could stand against
[270.20 → 272.86] And if our God is for us
[272.86 → 275.16] Then who could ever stop us
[275.16 → 277.48] And if our God is with us
[277.48 → 282.14] Then what could stand against
[282.14 → 291.20] What could stand against
[291.20 → 295.38] What could stand against
[295.38 → 297.22] Then who could ever stop us
[297.22 → 300.58] Come on, hallucinate for us
[301.34 → 305.34] So far
[305.34 → 335.32] Oh, my God.
[335.34 → 365.32] Oh, my God.
[365.34 → 367.34] Oh, my God.
[367.34 → 369.34] Oh, my God.
[369.34 → 371.34] Oh, my God.
[371.34 → 373.34] Oh, my God.
[373.34 → 375.34] Oh, my God.
[375.34 → 377.34] Oh, my God.
[377.34 → 379.34] Oh, my God.
[379.34 → 381.34] Oh, my God.
[381.34 → 392.08] Michael and Maria, someone said they thought they saw you
[392.08 → 395.96] Giving names to babies this world never knew
[395.96 → 401.14] I'm sure by now you've found your great-grandparents
[401.14 → 403.54] And some friends like Dave and Aaron
[403.54 → 406.66] I bet you've met Moses too
[406.66 → 412.70] We never knew how much our hearts could hurt until we lost you
[412.70 → 415.26] I know we didn't really lose you
[415.26 → 417.72] That's just how it feels down here
[417.72 → 422.88] And right now it seems we'll never understand God's higher ways
[422.88 → 427.22] But we are trusting Him until the day we do
[427.22 → 432.30] And He will carry us just like He carries you
[432.30 → 437.44] So Michael and Maria, we'll see you soon
[437.44 → 444.02] Oh, this is a long, hard journey
[444.02 → 448.86] We travel in the blink of an eye
[448.86 → 454.16] Oh, without this hope we have in Jesus
[454.16 → 458.16] There's no way on earth we could survive
[458.16 → 461.16] We would never survive
[461.16 → 475.50] No, we didn't really know how much we loved you until we lost you
[475.50 → 487.56] No, we didn't really know how much we loved you until we lost you
[487.56 → 490.26] I know we didn't really lose you
[490.26 → 492.48] It's just how it looks from here
[492.48 → 497.72] And right now it seems we'll never understand God's higher ways
[497.72 → 501.86] We are trusting Him until the day we do
[501.86 → 507.72] And He will carry us just like He carries you
[507.72 → 512.72] And if we believe His promises are true
[512.72 → 519.72] And Michael and Maria, I know we'll see you soon
[519.72 → 549.70] I know we'll see you soon
[549.72 → 579.70] But we'll see you soon
[579.72 → 601.72] Turn your eyes upon Jesus
[601.72 → 603.72] Turn your eyes upon Jesus
[603.72 → 615.72] Look full in His wonderful face
[615.72 → 629.72] And the things of earth will grow strange
[629.72 → 641.72] The light of His glory and grace
[641.72 → 647.72] O soul, are you weary and troubled?
[647.72 → 653.72] No light in the darkness you see
[653.72 → 659.72] There's light for a look at the Saviour
[659.72 → 665.72] And life more abundant and free
[665.72 → 671.72] To death and to life everlasting
[671.72 → 677.72] He passed, and we follow Him there
[677.72 → 683.72] O us and no more have dominion
[683.72 → 689.72] For more than conquerors we are
[689.72 → 701.72] O turn your eyes upon Jesus
[701.72 → 711.72] Look full in His wonderful face
[711.72 → 723.72] And the things of earth will grow strange
[723.72 → 727.72] In the light of His glory and grace
[727.72 → 739.72] In the light of His glory and grace
[739.72 → 743.72] His words shall not fail you
[743.72 → 745.72] He promised
[745.72 → 751.72] Believe Him and all will be well
[751.72 → 757.72] Then go to a world that is dying
[757.72 → 763.72] His perfect salvation to tell
[763.72 → 775.72] O turn your eyes upon Jesus
[775.72 → 785.72] Look full in His wonderful face
[793.72 → 815.72] Good morning everyone
[815.72 → 819.72] Welcome to church
[819.72 → 823.72] Special welcome if you are a guest among us this morning
[823.72 → 825.72] My name is Chris
[825.72 → 827.72] I'm one of the pastors here at Emmanuel
[827.72 → 831.72] And it's all of our unique opportunity
[831.72 → 833.72] To gather together in this place
[833.72 → 835.72] In this time
[835.72 → 837.72] With all the things that have been happening in our lives
[837.72 → 841.72] To take a moment and to come into the presence of God together
[841.72 → 843.72] That's really what worship is
[843.72 → 845.72] Gathering with God's people
[845.72 → 847.72] In God's presence
[847.72 → 850.72] And so this morning as we enter into that presence
[850.72 → 852.72] We invite you to open up your heart
[852.72 → 853.72] To the leading of the spirit
[853.72 → 855.72] To open up your ears to the voice of God
[855.72 → 859.72] And to bask in His glory together
[859.72 → 863.72] Before we begin our worship with song and prayer
[863.72 → 865.72] We have got a couple announcements we'd like to make
[865.72 → 868.72] And the first of which is just a few notes
[868.72 → 872.72] About the on-goings of life here at Emmanuel
[872.72 → 874.72] And so you've been hearing announcements
[874.72 → 878.72] About our Mexico mission trip and team
[878.72 → 880.72] And registration for that is open
[880.72 → 882.72] It's available online
[882.72 → 885.72] If you get the e-bulletins that is in there
[885.72 → 888.72] If you are curious about the Mexico mission trip
[888.72 → 890.72] And don't receive the e-bulletin
[890.72 → 893.72] You can grab either myself or Pastor Kevin or Brandon
[893.72 → 895.72] If he's here somewhere this morning
[895.72 → 896.72] I don't see him right now
[896.72 → 900.72] We'll happily connect you to the details on that
[900.72 → 902.72] For those of you who are interested
[902.72 → 905.72] In the Mexico mission trip
[905.72 → 907.72] And the registration for all of that
[907.72 → 910.72] There's going to be a meeting next week after church
[910.72 → 913.72] To bang out some of those details
[913.72 → 915.72] And make you aware of the kinds of things
[915.72 → 917.72] That are happening with that
[917.72 → 919.72] And so just mark your calendars for that
[919.72 → 924.72] Tonight the youth will gather for 2020
[924.72 → 926.72] That's 630 that's here at church
[926.72 → 928.72] And then next Saturday
[928.72 → 931.72] We have an opportunity to gather
[931.72 → 935.72] With different worshippers from our congregation
[935.72 → 937.72] With the community at Sun ridge
[937.72 → 939.72] Which is a retirement living facility
[939.72 → 940.72] Up the hill from us
[940.72 → 942.72] We send a small team in there
[942.72 → 944.72] We worship with them for a little bit
[944.72 → 945.72] From two to three or so
[945.72 → 947.72] And they kind of just hang out
[947.72 → 948.72] You're invited to join them
[948.72 → 950.72] As they lead that there
[950.72 → 952.72] And then lastly
[952.72 → 953.72] Next Sunday
[953.72 → 956.72] Is the first Sunday of the month
[956.72 → 958.72] And so the pre-service prayer group
[958.72 → 960.72] Will also be meeting before worship
[960.72 → 962.72] And so that will start at 9 o'clock
[962.72 → 963.72] In the library
[963.72 → 964.72] For those of you who are interested
[964.72 → 965.72] In meeting for prayer
[965.72 → 967.72] The pre-service prayer
[967.72 → 968.72] Before worship together
[968.72 → 971.72] Those are all the announcements on my list
[971.72 → 972.72] I'm going to look at my wife
[972.72 → 974.72] Who usually gives me an extra one
[974.72 → 975.72] And Pastor Kevin
[975.72 → 976.72] Who usually gives me one
[976.72 → 977.72] Nope, we're good?
[977.72 → 978.72] Then I'm going to invite you
[978.72 → 979.72] As you are able
[979.72 → 980.72] As you are able
[980.72 → 981.72] And where you are to stand
[981.72 → 982.72] We can be gathered together
[982.72 → 984.72] In the presence of God
[990.72 → 991.72] As we gather together
[991.72 → 993.72] We are indeed in the presence of God
[993.72 → 994.72] And so we mark that first
[994.72 → 996.72] By receiving his greeting
[996.72 → 998.72] Where God speaks to us
[998.72 → 999.72] Inviting him
[999.72 → 1001.72] Inviting us into his presence
[1001.72 → 1002.72] And then we turn
[1002.72 → 1004.72] And we extend that greeting
[1004.72 → 1005.72] To one another
[1005.72 → 1006.72] And, so I invite you
[1006.72 → 1007.72] To turn to those around you
[1007.72 → 1009.72] After I give the greeting
[1009.72 → 1011.72] And pass the peace of Christ
[1011.72 → 1012.72] Saying the peace of Christ
[1012.72 → 1013.72] Be with you
[1013.72 → 1014.72] Or the Lord be with you
[1014.72 → 1016.72] This is more than just good morning
[1016.72 → 1018.72] This is an act of worship together
[1018.72 → 1020.72] And so we mark God's presence here
[1020.72 → 1021.72] In our midst
[1021.72 → 1022.72] Receive the greeting then
[1022.72 → 1023.72] Of our good God
[1023.72 → 1028.72] Grace, mercy, and peace to you
[1028.72 → 1029.72] From God our Father
[1029.72 → 1031.72] From the Lord Jesus Christ
[1031.72 → 1033.72] His Son and our Saviour
[1033.72 → 1035.72] Through the presence and power
[1035.72 → 1036.72] Of the Holy Spirit
[1036.72 → 1037.72] Amen
[1037.72 → 1038.72] Amen
[1038.72 → 1039.72] Amen
[1068.72 → 1073.72] Our call to worship this morning
[1073.72 → 1076.72] Is found in Psalm 34
[1076.72 → 1081.72] I will extol the Lord at all times
[1081.72 → 1084.72] His praise will always be on my lips
[1084.72 → 1087.72] I will glory in the Lord
[1087.72 → 1089.72] Let the afflicted hear and rejoice
[1089.72 → 1092.72] Glorify the Lord within me
[1092.72 → 1095.72] Let us exalt his name together
[1095.72 → 1097.72] Let us sing together
[1097.72 → 1099.72] Let us sing together
[1099.72 → 1100.72] Let us sing together
[1100.72 → 1118.52] Jesus, hope of the nations
[1118.52 → 1124.20] Jesus, comfort for all who mourn
[1124.20 → 1131.06] You are the source of heaven's hope on earth
[1131.06 → 1134.58] Jesus, light in the darkness
[1134.58 → 1139.02] Jesus, truth in each circumstance
[1139.02 → 1146.36] You are the source of heaven's hope on earth
[1146.36 → 1150.50] In history you lived and died
[1150.50 → 1155.76] You rose to chains, you rose to life
[1155.76 → 1159.74] You are the hope living in us
[1159.74 → 1163.80] You are the rock in whom we trust
[1163.80 → 1170.50] You are the light shining for all the world to see
[1170.50 → 1175.84] You rose from the dead, conquering fear
[1175.84 → 1179.88] Our Prince of Peace, drive us here
[1179.88 → 1186.22] Jesus, our hope living for all who will receive
[1186.22 → 1189.84] Lord, we believe
[1189.84 → 1201.08] Jesus, hope of the nations
[1201.08 → 1206.94] Jesus, comfort for all who mourn
[1206.94 → 1213.66] You are the source of heaven's hope on earth
[1213.66 → 1217.50] Jesus, light in the darkness
[1217.50 → 1222.08] Jesus, truth in each circumstance
[1222.08 → 1229.36] You are the source of heaven's light on earth
[1229.36 → 1233.76] In history you lived and died
[1233.76 → 1239.04] You broke the chains, you rose to life
[1239.04 → 1243.08] You are the hope living in us
[1243.08 → 1247.18] You are the rock in whom we trust
[1247.18 → 1254.04] You are the light shining for all the world to see
[1254.04 → 1259.42] You rose from the dead, conquering fear
[1259.42 → 1263.52] Our Prince of Peace, drive us near
[1263.52 → 1269.52] Jesus, our hope living for all who will receive
[1269.52 → 1273.78] Lord, we believe
[1273.78 → 1277.78] Lord, we believe
[1277.78 → 1281.94] Lord, we believe
[1281.94 → 1311.92] Lord, we believe

[1341.90 → 1371.88] Lord, we believe
[1371.88 → 1373.88] Jesus died for me
[1373.88 → 1375.88] Jesus died for me
[1375.88 → 1379.88] Yes, He died for me
[1379.88 → 1384.88] Who the Son sets free
[1384.88 → 1389.88] Oh, is free indeed
[1389.88 → 1393.88] I'm a child of God
[1393.88 → 1397.88] Yes, I am

[1467.88 → 1469.88] I am
[1469.88 → 1471.88] I am
[1471.88 → 1475.88] I am
[1475.88 → 1481.88] I am
[1481.88 → 1483.88] I am
[1483.88 → 1493.88] I am
[1493.88 → 1501.76] In my Father's house, there's a place for me.
[1502.46 → 1506.56] I'm a child of God.
[1507.02 → 1510.76] Yes, I am.
[1512.10 → 1513.52] I invite you to take a seat.
[1513.52 → 1515.52] Amen.
[1522.76 → 1527.18] We've been reading through the letters to the churches in Revelation
[1527.18 → 1530.30] through a Bible study called Bible Study Fellowship.
[1530.94 → 1536.50] And I was struck with what Jesus was saying to the church in Philadelphia,
[1536.66 → 1537.94] and so I thought I'd read that part.
[1538.54 → 1539.98] To the church in Philadelphia,
[1539.98 → 1544.02] to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write,
[1544.88 → 1547.34] These are the words of him who is holy and true,
[1547.76 → 1549.40] who holds the keys of David.
[1550.06 → 1551.80] What he opens, no one can shut.
[1552.58 → 1554.70] What he shuts, no one can open.
[1555.14 → 1556.02] I know your deeds.
[1556.78 → 1560.08] See, I have placed before you an open door that no one can shut.
[1560.62 → 1562.62] I know that you have little strength.
[1563.32 → 1566.12] You have kept my word and have not denied my name.
[1566.12 → 1570.10] And those last two lines are what I was focusing on.
[1571.18 → 1574.28] You have kept my word and never denied my name.
[1575.42 → 1579.96] There are so many ways the culture that we live in are asking us,
[1580.60 → 1586.46] maybe even demanding us not to acknowledge who Jesus is.
[1587.24 → 1590.18] They're attempting us to look elsewhere for life's answers,
[1591.06 → 1593.74] telling us there are so many different ways to the Father,
[1593.74 → 1596.44] challenging us to fit into our culture.
[1597.34 → 1598.48] They're saying things like,
[1598.54 → 1599.08] You deserve it.
[1599.20 → 1601.08] You deserve the good things in life.
[1602.00 → 1603.28] I find, for me anyway,
[1603.34 → 1606.16] these things really are easy to creep into your life
[1606.16 → 1608.36] because it's just so pervasive around us.
[1609.12 → 1611.92] Ideas that can change even the motivation of your heart.
[1612.68 → 1613.74] And it ends up,
[1613.74 → 1617.38] Boy, I hate it when I get emotional.
[1618.90 → 1624.42] But it ends up putting yourself on the throne.
[1627.56 → 1628.96] I've also lost my place.
[1631.44 → 1631.82] So,
[1632.08 → 1634.26] we need to be a people
[1634.26 → 1636.88] that put Jesus first,
[1637.58 → 1639.72] that stand up for the name of Jesus.
[1639.72 → 1639.84] Jesus.
[1640.54 → 1641.48] What struck me was,
[1641.60 → 1642.82] if you truly love someone,
[1643.08 → 1644.72] you will never deny knowing them,
[1645.14 → 1646.56] but you will stand with them.
[1647.34 → 1650.46] And you'll cherish the words that they speak to you.
[1651.42 → 1652.40] Let's bow our heads.
[1655.00 → 1655.56] Father,
[1656.84 → 1658.92] strengthen us by your spirit.
[1660.70 → 1663.58] Forgive us for allowing the culture we live in
[1663.58 → 1665.34] to influence our thinking.
[1665.34 → 1668.60] Forgive us when we haven't stood for you,
[1669.22 → 1671.18] when we haven't cherished your words
[1671.18 → 1673.02] or spent time talking with you.
[1674.02 → 1676.50] And even though we may have little strength,
[1676.74 → 1680.10] will you help us keep your words deep within our hearts?
[1681.14 → 1682.04] Holy Spirit,
[1682.16 → 1683.86] help us to prove our love for Jesus
[1683.86 → 1685.66] by standing for his name.
[1686.42 → 1688.68] In Jesus' powerful name we pray.
[1689.00 → 1689.36] Amen.
[1692.62 → 1693.94] Would you stand with us
[1693.94 → 1695.12] as we sing these last two?
[1695.34 → 1714.04] Here is love vast as the ocean,
[1714.86 → 1718.34] loving kindness as the flood.
[1719.22 → 1723.64] When the prince of life are at sun,
[1723.64 → 1728.96] Shed for us his precious blood
[1728.96 → 1739.94] Here is love lost as the ocean
[1739.94 → 1744.64] Loving kindness as a flood
[1744.64 → 1748.64] When the prince of life our ransom
[1748.64 → 1753.62] Shed for us his precious blood
[1753.62 → 1757.80] Who his love will remember
[1757.80 → 1762.96] Who can cease to sing his praise
[1762.96 → 1766.96] He can never be forgotten
[1766.96 → 1772.76] Throughout his eternal days
[1778.76 → 1782.76] On the mount of crucifixion
[1782.76 → 1787.76] Fountains open deep and wide
[1788.32 → 1792.10] Through those muggings of God's mercy
[1792.10 → 1796.10] Float a vast and gracious tide
[1796.10 → 1801.10] Praise and love like mighty rivers
[1801.10 → 1806.10] Heart incessant from above
[1806.10 → 1810.44] Heaven's peace and perfect justice
[1810.44 → 1815.56] Gives the guilty world in love
[1815.56 → 1819.54] Who his love will not remember
[1819.54 → 1824.10] Who can cease to sing his praise
[1824.10 → 1829.10] He can never be forgotten
[1829.10 → 1833.44] Throughout his eternal days
[1833.46 → 1842.78] Under his eternal days
[1842.78 → 1844.86] driving home
[1844.86 → 1846.78] He can never be forgotten
[1846.78 → 1850.78] He can never be forgotten
[1850.78 → 1870.62] We are a moment, you are forever
[1870.62 → 1878.20] Lord of the ages, God before time
[1878.20 → 1884.84] We are a vapour, you are eternal
[1884.84 → 1894.12] Love everlasting, reigning on God
[1894.12 → 1900.64] Holy, holy Lord God almighty
[1900.64 → 1907.64] Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
[1908.20 → 1914.64] Lion's praises, honour and glory
[1914.64 → 1920.64] Be unto your name
[1920.64 → 1928.20] Be unto your name
[1928.20 → 1934.64] We are the broken, you are the healer
[1935.50 → 1941.64] Jesus, Redeemer, mighty to save
[1941.64 → 1948.56] You are the love song, we'll sing forever
[1948.56 → 1956.64] Vowing before you, blessing your name
[1957.20 → 1963.38] Holy, holy Lord God almighty
[1963.38 → 1969.64] Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
[1969.64 → 1976.90] Highest praises, honour and glory
[1976.90 → 1982.64] Be unto your name
[1982.64 → 1989.64] Be unto your name
[1989.64 → 1996.90] Holy, holy Lord God almighty
[1996.90 → 2002.64] Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
[2002.64 → 2008.90] Highest praises, honour and glory
[2008.90 → 2014.64] Be unto your name
[2014.64 → 2021.90] Be unto your name
[2021.90 → 2027.90] Be unto your name
[2027.90 → 2038.34] Good morning
[2038.34 → 2041.92] My name is Mike and I serve as a deacon here on behalf of the church family
[2041.92 → 2045.88] And I am just highlighting a few of our ways to give today
[2045.88 → 2049.64] So we're going to take a moment to give of our financial gifts on behalf of this family
[2049.64 → 2053.22] So the first is to the church budget and the ministries of this church
[2053.22 → 2058.32] And if you have a donation there you can stick it in a little envelope or indicate such on the check and such
[2058.32 → 2061.22] The second one is to the benevolence fund
[2061.22 → 2063.72] And we actually had a few questions this week about that
[2063.72 → 2070.30] But the benevolence fund is kind of the pot of money that the deacons use to help people out practically
[2070.30 → 2073.96] So the deacons of course are happy to serve on behalf of this church
[2073.96 → 2076.96] To connect people to resources, sit with people, visit people
[2076.96 → 2079.08] Try to organize some of that on behalf of the family
[2079.08 → 2083.44] But this is the pot of fun that is used to help out people when they need groceries
[2083.44 → 2085.12] Or access to counselling
[2085.12 → 2086.94] Or to other basic needs
[2086.94 → 2088.94] That they or their families are feeling
[2088.94 → 2092.08] So I just want to lean into this a little bit this morning
[2092.08 → 2095.28] Because that fund is actually running a little bit empty
[2095.28 → 2098.84] There's been a lot of needs in the last six months or so
[2098.84 → 2102.02] And we're coming into usually what is
[2102.02 → 2104.68] A more trying time for a lot of families in Langley
[2104.68 → 2107.68] So we have some need there
[2107.68 → 2110.66] So we thank you so much for your generosity
[2110.66 → 2113.40] I know there's a lot of people in this church who give to this fund regularly
[2113.40 → 2117.14] And the deacons are doing their best to make the best use of it
[2117.14 → 2118.80] So thank you for that
[2118.80 → 2120.76] And if you ever have questions about what the deacons do
[2120.76 → 2122.78] Please let us know
[2122.78 → 2126.48] But again, I appreciate your generosity this morning towards these two needs
[2126.48 → 2148.96] I have a maker
[2148.96 → 2155.96] He knows my name
[2155.96 → 2157.96] He knows my every thought
[2157.96 → 2159.96] He knows my name
[2159.96 → 2165.96] He knows my every thought
[2165.96 → 2169.96] He knows my every thought
[2169.96 → 2184.96] He sees each fear that falls
[2184.96 → 2188.96] And hears me when I call
[2188.96 → 2195.96] I have a father
[2195.96 → 2201.96] He calls me his own
[2201.96 → 2207.96] He'll never leave me
[2207.96 → 2213.96] No matter where I go
[2213.96 → 2214.96] He knows my name
[2214.96 → 2216.96] He knows my name
[2216.96 → 2220.96] He knows my every thought
[2220.96 → 2224.96] He knows my every thought
[2224.96 → 2230.96] He sees each fear that falls
[2230.96 → 2234.96] And hears me when I call
[2234.96 → 2235.96] When I call
[2235.96 → 2253.96] He hears me when I call
[2253.96 → 2259.96] He hears me when I call
[2259.96 → 2265.20] And hears me when I call
[2289.96 → 2311.90] So this morning, we're going to start by just thinking about if we've ever made a mistake.
[2312.36 → 2314.00] Has anybody ever made a mistake?
[2315.20 → 2317.08] A few of you have made a mistake.
[2317.30 → 2318.62] I have definitely made a mistake.
[2318.62 → 2321.54] You know what? Sometimes you might, you don't have to raise your hand,
[2321.66 → 2326.00] but you might have thought of a time when you kind of did something bad, and maybe you got in trouble.
[2326.68 → 2330.26] I can think of that when I was a kid or even when I was an adult.
[2331.24 → 2337.06] Has anyone ever done something so bad that they were put in prison?
[2339.28 → 2341.34] No, not any of you guys. Anybody?
[2342.38 → 2343.42] No one's been in prison?
[2344.36 → 2346.44] No? No one's been in prison.
[2346.44 → 2346.54] No one's been in prison.
[2347.24 → 2353.64] Well, you'd have to do something pretty serious if that was your consequence in our world to go into prison.
[2353.80 → 2357.18] And today in children's worship, we're going to talk about Joseph.
[2357.40 → 2359.60] We know that. We've been talking about Joseph for a few weeks.
[2359.74 → 2366.28] But the funny thing about Joseph is he got put into prison, and he didn't actually do anything wrong.
[2366.28 → 2368.92] That would be pretty scary.
[2369.46 → 2373.68] So that's what our theme is today, and we're going to be talking about how God is with us
[2373.68 → 2376.22] and able to use us no matter where we are.
[2376.80 → 2382.40] So let's stand up, and we'll do our blessing, and then we'll head off and learn more about that story together.
[2396.28 → 2414.26] Good morning.
[2414.82 → 2420.06] My name is Ken. I'm an elder here at Emanuel, and I'll be leading us in our church family prayer this morning.
[2420.06 → 2422.96] As we were singing that last song, it kind of hit me a little bit.
[2423.02 → 2424.00] He knows my name.
[2424.42 → 2425.22] I was just thinking about that.
[2425.34 → 2431.28] How cool would it be if someone real popular or famous, I'm going up to them and get the moment to meet them and actually greet them.
[2431.38 → 2433.48] And before I even say hello, they say, oh, hi, Ken.
[2433.90 → 2436.40] Like, oh, yeah, that would be such an amazing experience.
[2436.48 → 2441.36] And yet God, the maker of the universe, the creator of everything, knows each one of our names.
[2441.60 → 2442.78] He knows our every thought.
[2443.00 → 2444.76] He sees each tear that falls.
[2445.18 → 2446.34] And he hears us when we call.
[2446.34 → 2450.82] I thought, wow, that's a great call for us to come together and call out to him in prayer.
[2450.94 → 2452.16] So let's do that together this morning.
[2454.14 → 2459.66] Lord our God, it is humbling to think that we can not only approach you in prayer,
[2460.04 → 2464.24] but that your spirit intercedes for us when we do not know what we ought to pray for.
[2465.04 → 2466.90] Lord, you search us and you know us.
[2467.38 → 2468.98] You know when we sit and when we rise.
[2469.46 → 2471.12] You know our thoughts from afar.
[2471.56 → 2474.18] You discern our going out and our lying down.
[2474.18 → 2477.56] You are familiar with all our ways.
[2478.30 → 2481.52] And before a word is on our tongues, Lord, you know it completely.
[2482.56 → 2486.12] Lord, you call us out to not be anxious about anything,
[2486.40 → 2489.06] but in every situation, by prayer and petition,
[2489.50 → 2492.00] with thanksgiving, to present our requests to you.
[2492.70 → 2494.96] Lord, we confess that we often forget to do this.
[2495.54 → 2498.40] When we are wrestling with our anxious thoughts, Holy Spirit,
[2498.96 → 2500.88] help us fall to our knees in prayer
[2500.88 → 2503.46] and approach your throne of grace with confidence.
[2504.62 → 2507.14] Lord, we thank you for every good and perfect gift.
[2507.66 → 2509.84] We thank you for our church family here at Emmanuel.
[2510.64 → 2512.10] We thank you for our families.
[2512.78 → 2515.24] We thank you for shelter, food, clean water,
[2515.38 → 2517.74] and all the provisions that we often take for granted.
[2518.68 → 2521.14] We thank you for jobs, health, and friends.
[2521.70 → 2525.10] And above all, Lord, we are grateful for the righteousness we are given in Jesus
[2525.10 → 2526.78] through your death and resurrection.
[2526.78 → 2530.80] Lord, when we are discouraged, when we think all is lost,
[2531.30 → 2533.26] help us start to count our many blessings,
[2533.64 → 2536.18] and we'll once again see you at work in so many ways.
[2537.26 → 2541.08] Lord, you are the one who forgives all of our sins and heals our diseases.
[2541.62 → 2543.22] And we lift those in our congregation
[2543.22 → 2545.72] who are dealing with health challenges of various kinds.
[2546.66 → 2548.84] We pray a prayer of praise with Judy Vertigo
[2548.84 → 2551.36] as she had open-heart surgery to fix a leaking valve
[2551.36 → 2552.74] and that it was successful, Lord.
[2553.14 → 2555.42] And we pray for full recovery for Judy.
[2555.42 → 2558.46] We also lift Louise Condos
[2558.46 → 2561.00] as she navigates her diagnosis of Bell's palsy.
[2561.58 → 2564.14] Lord, we pray for quick and complete healing for Louise
[2564.14 → 2565.96] and patience for her in this time.
[2566.98 → 2568.04] Lord, we lift Ashley
[2568.04 → 2570.20] as she embarks on a lengthy chemo treatment
[2570.20 → 2571.54] for the cancer in her body.
[2572.38 → 2574.58] Lord, please be with her husband, herself,
[2574.78 → 2576.92] and her four kids as they navigate this journey.
[2577.36 → 2580.30] And we ask, Lord, that you give her strength and complete healing.
[2581.52 → 2583.42] We also pray, Lord, for those who are grappling
[2583.42 → 2586.20] with the challenges and changes that come with aging bodies.
[2586.96 → 2588.86] Please be with those who are shut in
[2588.86 → 2590.96] and cannot be with us in person on Sundays.
[2591.58 → 2595.04] We pray that they can feel your presence in their lives
[2595.04 → 2597.10] and a sense of community from a distance.
[2598.38 → 2599.78] We pray for caretakers.
[2600.46 → 2602.90] Lord, give them energy and strength to care for loved ones
[2602.90 → 2605.98] and help them get respite from time to time as well.
[2606.94 → 2609.72] And Lord, we lift our leaders in all levels of government,
[2609.72 → 2612.32] in our schools and institutions, and in your church.
[2612.82 → 2615.94] Please help them recognize that all authority comes from you
[2615.94 → 2619.40] and that your will sets the standard for everything we do.
[2620.28 → 2623.36] Lord, when we slip or step out of alignment with your will,
[2623.76 → 2625.14] we ask for your forgiveness,
[2625.54 → 2628.26] and we praise you for working all things together
[2628.26 → 2630.56] for your glory despite our shortcomings.
[2631.66 → 2633.58] And Lord, as we open your word this morning
[2633.58 → 2634.60] and hear your message,
[2634.94 → 2636.68] we pray that you speak through Pastor Kevin
[2636.68 → 2638.58] that all gathered together here
[2638.58 → 2640.88] would grow in our knowledge and faith in you
[2640.88 → 2642.54] and go out into our week,
[2642.80 → 2644.08] renewed to share the gospel.
[2644.54 → 2646.48] We pray all these things in Jesus' name.
[2646.96 → 2647.16] Amen.
[2663.16 → 2664.48] Good morning, everyone.
[2664.48 → 2668.94] Today we're going to be continuing our sermon series
[2668.94 → 2671.08] on Joseph, the son of Jacob.
[2671.70 → 2673.86] If you've been with us the past few weeks,
[2674.24 → 2676.82] perhaps you recall the story up until this point.
[2677.42 → 2679.18] Joseph, at the beginning of this story,
[2679.30 → 2680.76] rather untactfully,
[2681.30 → 2684.70] describes some dreams he has to his family,
[2685.30 → 2687.82] saying that they will eventually bow down to him.
[2688.90 → 2691.18] Well, that straight up ticked off his brother's plenty,
[2691.38 → 2693.98] and him already being the favourite brother of the batch,
[2693.98 → 2695.86] they decide that they want to kill him.
[2695.98 → 2697.94] But cooler heads prevail,
[2697.94 → 2701.80] and they end up instead selling him into slavery.
[2702.62 → 2704.02] The brothers then trick their dad
[2704.02 → 2705.66] into thinking that Joseph has died,
[2705.76 → 2708.98] and Jacob then mourns for the loss of his son
[2708.98 → 2710.38] for many, many days.
[2710.92 → 2714.40] Meanwhile, Joseph was sold in Egypt
[2714.40 → 2715.76] to a man named Rotifer,
[2715.84 → 2717.14] who was an official to Pharaoh.
[2717.68 → 2720.48] That's where we're picking the story up today,
[2720.48 → 2722.66] in Genesis chapter 39.
[2722.98 → 2724.20] So as always, I invite you,
[2724.44 → 2725.26] open up your Bibles,
[2725.38 → 2726.82] have them open in front of you.
[2727.00 → 2728.46] If you want to use your Bible apps,
[2728.50 → 2729.76] that's totally cool as well,
[2730.06 → 2731.56] but you keep those open with you,
[2731.58 → 2733.18] as we'll be referencing back.
[2733.44 → 2735.04] We're going to be reading the entire chapter,
[2735.46 → 2736.36] Genesis 39,
[2736.60 → 2737.80], so please follow along with me.
[2738.88 → 2741.04] Genesis 39, 1 to 23, says this.
[2741.86 → 2744.22] Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt.
[2745.10 → 2746.52] Rotifer, an Egyptian,
[2746.52 → 2748.28] who was one of Pharaoh's officials,
[2748.40 → 2749.42] the captain of the guard,
[2749.82 → 2751.70] bought him from the Ishmaelites,
[2751.82 → 2752.90] who had taken him there.
[2753.92 → 2755.04] The Lord was with Joseph,
[2755.18 → 2756.20] so that he prospered,
[2756.20 → 2758.44] and he lived in the house of his Egyptian master.
[2758.90 → 2761.02] When his master saw that the Lord was with him,
[2761.14 → 2763.02] and that the Lord gave him success
[2763.02 → 2764.16] in everything he did,
[2764.74 → 2767.14] Joseph found favour in his eyes,
[2767.50 → 2769.24] and became his attendant.
[2770.42 → 2772.40] Rotifer put him in charge of his whole household,
[2772.40 → 2776.58] and he entrusted to his care everything he owned.
[2776.88 → 2778.94] From the time he put him in charge of his household
[2778.94 → 2780.86] and all that he owned,
[2780.94 → 2783.32] the Lord blessed the household of the Egyptian
[2783.32 → 2785.32] because of Joseph.
[2786.06 → 2788.64] The blessing of the Lord was on everything Rotifer had,
[2788.84 → 2790.22] both in the house and in the field,
[2790.80 → 2794.16] so Rotifer left everything he had in Joseph's care.
[2794.86 → 2795.72] With Joseph in charge,
[2795.78 → 2797.46] he did not concern himself with anything
[2797.46 → 2799.26] except the food that he ate.
[2800.50 → 2801.92] Now Joseph was well-built,
[2801.92 → 2802.46] and handsome,
[2802.62 → 2803.62] and after a while,
[2803.98 → 2806.50] his master's wife took notice of Joseph
[2806.50 → 2807.58] and said,
[2807.84 → 2808.78] Come to bed with me.
[2809.70 → 2810.68] But he refused.
[2811.14 → 2811.96] With me in charge,
[2812.02 → 2812.44] he told her,
[2812.48 → 2814.28] my master does not concern himself
[2814.28 → 2815.28] with anything in the house.
[2815.54 → 2816.48] Everything he owns,
[2816.56 → 2817.82] he's entrusted to my care.
[2818.30 → 2821.08] No one is greater in this house than I am.
[2821.30 → 2823.22] My master has withheld nothing from me
[2823.22 → 2824.46] except you,
[2824.76 → 2825.90] because you are his wife.
[2826.88 → 2830.14] How then could I do such a wicked thing
[2830.14 → 2831.98] and sin against God?
[2833.00 → 2835.06] And though she spoke to Joseph day after day,
[2835.14 → 2837.20] he refused to go to bed with her,
[2837.62 → 2839.18] or even be with her.
[2840.40 → 2842.68] One day he went to the house to attend to his duties,
[2842.68 → 2844.56] and none of the household servants were inside.
[2844.90 → 2846.82] She caught him by his cloak and said,
[2847.08 → 2848.18] Come to bed with me.
[2848.18 → 2851.08] But he left his cloak in her hand
[2851.08 → 2852.76] and ran out of the house.
[2853.56 → 2855.94] When she saw that he had left his cloak in her hand
[2855.94 → 2856.82] and ran out of the house,
[2856.98 → 2858.70] she called to her household servants,
[2858.82 → 2859.04] Look!
[2859.34 → 2860.06] She said to them,
[2860.18 → 2861.90] This Hebrew has been brought to us
[2861.90 → 2863.12] to make sport of us.
[2863.54 → 2865.62] He came in here to sleep with me.
[2866.02 → 2866.74] But I screamed.
[2867.02 → 2868.30] When he heard me scream for help,
[2868.36 → 2869.64] he left his cloak beside me
[2869.64 → 2870.76] and ran out of the house.
[2871.76 → 2873.34] She kept his cloak beside her
[2873.34 → 2874.56] until his master came home.
[2874.56 → 2876.88] Then she told him this story,
[2877.38 → 2878.92] That Hebrew slave you brought us
[2878.92 → 2880.56] came to me to make sport of me.
[2880.70 → 2882.20] But as soon as I screamed for help,
[2882.44 → 2884.04] he left his cloak beside me
[2884.04 → 2885.34] and ran out of the house.
[2886.56 → 2888.22] When his master heard this story,
[2888.56 → 2890.14] his wife was telling him, saying,
[2890.56 → 2892.36] This is how your slave treated me?
[2892.46 → 2894.00] He burned with anger.
[2895.08 → 2896.22] Joseph's master took him
[2896.22 → 2897.36] and put him in prison,
[2897.52 → 2899.64] the place where the king's prisoners were confined.
[2900.86 → 2902.72] But while Joseph was there in the prison,
[2902.84 → 2903.96] the Lord was with him.
[2903.96 → 2905.04] He showed him kindness
[2905.04 → 2906.08] and granted him favour
[2906.08 → 2908.02] in the eyes of the prison warden.
[2908.46 → 2910.00] So the warden put Joseph in charge
[2910.00 → 2911.76] of all those held in the prison,
[2911.96 → 2913.12] and he was made responsible
[2913.12 → 2914.50] for all that was done there.
[2914.96 → 2916.16] The warden paid no attention
[2916.16 → 2917.66] to anything under Joseph's care
[2917.66 → 2919.70] because the Lord was with Joseph
[2919.70 → 2921.00] and gave him success
[2921.00 → 2922.30] in whatever he did.
[2923.32 → 2924.32] The word of the Lord.
[2927.64 → 2929.72] So we've covered the narrative to this point,
[2929.80 → 2931.08] but let's quickly remember perhaps
[2931.08 → 2933.30] what we've learned these past few weeks
[2933.30 → 2934.60] from this story.
[2934.74 → 2935.36] So at first,
[2935.76 → 2937.54] we learned that there is always hope
[2937.54 → 2940.32] because God has victory over the future.
[2941.22 → 2943.26] We know that at the end of this story,
[2944.12 → 2945.40] Joseph's dreams that he had
[2945.40 → 2946.42] at the beginning of the story
[2946.42 → 2947.06] do come true,
[2947.18 → 2949.12] and we know that at the end of history,
[2949.46 → 2951.80] God's plans for eternity will play out.
[2952.54 → 2953.88] Through God's sovereignty,
[2954.10 → 2956.30] meaning through his complete authority
[2956.30 → 2958.74] over everything that he has created,
[2959.26 → 2961.46] God already has victory over the future,
[2962.08 → 2963.64] even over our future,
[2964.26 → 2965.18] so we can have hope.
[2966.38 → 2967.20] And then last week,
[2967.24 → 2969.66] we learned that God is always at work.
[2970.70 → 2972.58] We should remember meanwhile,
[2972.98 → 2973.74] if you recall.
[2974.30 → 2975.64] In the trials we face,
[2975.82 → 2976.98] when things seem rough,
[2977.30 → 2979.22] even if we never see or comprehend
[2979.22 → 2980.24] what God is up to,
[2980.90 → 2982.76] God is always at work.
[2982.76 → 2985.90] When suffering enters our world,
[2986.60 → 2989.26] and suffering can mean so many things.
[2989.80 → 2991.52] There's suffering on like a macro level,
[2991.58 → 2992.70] on a global front,
[2993.12 → 2993.26] right,
[2993.30 → 2994.64] like war and persecution,
[2995.00 → 2995.80] and then there's suffering
[2995.80 → 2996.66] that's more localized,
[2997.50 → 3000.02] things like grief and anxiety.
[3001.28 → 3002.80] Suffering can be hard to define
[3002.80 → 3005.16] because we all experience it so differently
[3005.16 → 3006.80] and in unique ways,
[3006.92 → 3007.88] but in some ways,
[3007.92 → 3009.22] it isn't hard to define it all
[3009.22 → 3010.90] because we've all gone through it.
[3012.00 → 3013.26] Perhaps some of us
[3013.26 → 3014.32] are going through it right now.
[3016.24 → 3017.32] But as we suffer,
[3017.72 → 3019.34] we can be certain of our future
[3019.34 → 3022.12] because it is victorious in Jesus Christ,
[3022.72 → 3024.24] and we can know that God
[3024.24 → 3025.82] is working in our circumstances,
[3025.82 → 3028.48] even if we can't, or we'll never see it.
[3029.72 → 3031.40] That's how so far we've held up
[3031.40 → 3033.10] God's sovereignty and our suffering.
[3033.10 → 3036.10] And so now, today,
[3036.24 → 3037.28] we get to this story.
[3038.40 → 3039.30] Chapter 39.
[3040.66 → 3041.92] It's a rough story,
[3042.60 → 3043.20] isn't it?
[3044.00 → 3046.30] It can even make the blood boil a little bit.
[3046.74 → 3048.66] This Joseph just can't catch a break.
[3048.82 → 3050.30] He's hated by his brothers,
[3050.70 → 3052.24] he's thrown into a well,
[3052.52 → 3053.64] he's sold to traitors,
[3053.88 → 3055.76] he's then sold into slavery in Egypt,
[3056.00 → 3056.80] and then today,
[3056.98 → 3058.72] he is falsely accused of a crime
[3058.72 → 3060.18] that he did everything in his power
[3060.18 → 3060.92] to not commit,
[3060.92 → 3063.18] and he gets chucked into prison anyway.
[3065.02 → 3066.48] This guy does everything right
[3066.48 → 3068.54] and then gets all the blame.
[3070.02 → 3071.42] I remember in elementary school,
[3072.00 → 3073.70] there was this bully in our school
[3073.70 → 3074.96] who was a year younger than me,
[3075.28 → 3076.06] and he wasn't big,
[3076.10 → 3077.44] I was actually quite a bit bigger than him,
[3077.54 → 3079.18] so he was pretty easy to ignore,
[3079.46 → 3080.64] and he was younger already,
[3081.22 → 3082.72] so I could ignore him most of the time.
[3083.74 → 3084.60] But then one day,
[3084.68 → 3086.44] I saw him shove this
[3086.44 → 3089.44] pretty small, timid little kid over
[3089.44 → 3090.66] who was even younger than him.
[3090.92 → 3093.82] And I knew this kid was timid,
[3093.88 → 3094.94] I knew he was soft-spoken,
[3095.60 → 3098.02] and I was kind of a conflict avoider back then,
[3098.06 → 3099.44] I still am today to some degree,
[3099.78 → 3100.94] but that set me off.
[3101.90 → 3103.10] And I went after him,
[3103.32 → 3104.66] and I grabbed him by the shoulders,
[3104.88 → 3105.86] and I pulled him down,
[3105.98 → 3107.02] and I pinned him to the ground,
[3107.02 → 3108.96] and I don't really remember much else,
[3109.48 → 3110.96] except that a crowd gathered,
[3111.20 → 3112.30] and then a teacher came,
[3112.38 → 3113.38] and then the crowd dispersed,
[3113.74 → 3115.22] and I was the only one who got in trouble.
[3115.22 → 3119.82] I was the only one who got sent to the office that day,
[3119.90 → 3120.64] and I was frustrated,
[3120.72 → 3122.62] because I thought my vigilante justice
[3122.62 → 3123.66] was well-deserved.
[3124.18 → 3125.48] It was well-warranted,
[3125.82 → 3128.54] but I was the only one who got in trouble for it.
[3129.62 → 3131.86] See, the concept of being falsely accused
[3131.86 → 3133.92] is why movies like Double Jeopardy,
[3134.04 → 3134.80] or The Fugitive,
[3135.04 → 3136.52] or Shashank Redemption
[3136.52 → 3138.26] are so popular.
[3138.26 → 3142.12] When someone's falsely accused,
[3142.40 → 3144.52] our sense of justice just spikes,
[3144.94 → 3146.36] and it becomes dramatic,
[3146.46 → 3147.68] and it lights a fire in us
[3147.68 → 3149.08] to see the good ones win.
[3150.38 → 3152.48] And this story about Joseph does just that.
[3152.56 → 3153.82] We read about how Joseph
[3153.82 → 3155.54] was nothing but faithful to God,
[3155.78 → 3157.76] was nothing but faithful to his master,
[3158.12 → 3158.90] Rotifer even.
[3160.18 → 3161.72] But just because Joseph
[3161.72 → 3164.34] was well-built and handsome,
[3165.06 → 3166.14] which, by the way,
[3166.66 → 3167.90] is going to be the title of my autobiography,
[3168.26 → 3169.52] when I start to write it.
[3170.32 → 3171.40] Well-built and handsome,
[3171.52 → 3172.56] the Kevin Robert story.
[3173.64 → 3174.96] It's my book, it's my title,
[3175.02 → 3176.34] and you shouldn't be laughing so hard.
[3177.68 → 3178.94] No, because he was a good man,
[3178.98 → 3180.22] and he was easy on the eyes,
[3180.38 → 3182.22] Rotifer's wife starts to hit on him.
[3183.22 → 3184.02] But he refuses.
[3185.36 → 3187.00] Eventually, she gets a little bit more physical,
[3187.16 → 3188.16] and so Joseph runs away,
[3188.24 → 3189.40] but leaves evidence behind.
[3189.48 → 3190.20] So she gets mad,
[3190.26 → 3191.18] she lies to her husband,
[3191.54 → 3192.66] and Joseph's thrown in jail.
[3194.70 → 3196.34] See, the story should irk us.
[3196.34 → 3199.44] It should ignite a plea for justice.
[3200.84 → 3204.22] But because this story is so anger-inducing,
[3204.52 → 3206.30] it also causes us to miss
[3206.30 → 3208.02] some very important information.
[3210.08 → 3212.28] We miss the bookends to this story
[3212.28 → 3213.74] because the middle of it
[3213.74 → 3215.68] is so compelling.
[3216.56 → 3218.12] It irks us so much.
[3219.10 → 3220.04] The story starts,
[3220.38 → 3221.06] and it ends,
[3221.26 → 3223.02] with focal points for us today.
[3223.02 → 3225.16] But we often just blow over it,
[3225.20 → 3226.24] even though it's central
[3226.24 → 3228.08] to this entire narrative of Joseph.
[3229.52 → 3231.52] The bookends to this story really matter,
[3232.20 → 3234.86] and they provide our God hint this morning
[3234.86 → 3236.02] in our suffering.
[3236.94 → 3237.58] Find them with me.
[3237.64 → 3238.04] Verse 2.
[3239.28 → 3240.54] Verse 2, it says this.
[3241.52 → 3243.24] The Lord was with Joseph.
[3244.68 → 3246.18] And then at the end of all of this,
[3246.26 → 3247.48] verse 21, take a look.
[3247.48 → 3250.34] The Lord was with him.
[3252.98 → 3254.60] Even in all the hardships
[3254.60 → 3255.96] that Joseph was going through,
[3256.84 → 3257.92] God was there.
[3259.04 → 3260.08] He was with him.
[3261.38 → 3262.84] That's our God hint today.
[3263.00 → 3265.10] You are not alone.
[3265.10 → 3270.22] As Joseph was thrown into a well,
[3270.74 → 3272.26] as he was sold into slavery,
[3272.76 → 3274.06] even as he was sent to prison
[3274.06 → 3275.62] for a crime he did not commit,
[3276.38 → 3279.18] the Lord was with him always.
[3281.94 → 3284.02] See, even in our hardships,
[3285.20 → 3286.80] even when life seems unfair,
[3286.96 → 3288.90] even when things are unjust to us,
[3288.90 → 3291.04] even when we find ourselves suffering,
[3291.58 → 3293.98] we can be certain that we are not alone.
[3295.10 → 3298.00] Now, it's easy for me to say
[3298.00 → 3299.00] from up here, right?
[3300.22 → 3301.02] And that's fair.
[3301.88 → 3302.88] Like, I would never stand
[3302.88 → 3303.90] in front of you all today
[3303.90 → 3305.54] and say, I understand
[3305.54 → 3306.86] what all of you are going through.
[3307.40 → 3308.18] Of course I can't.
[3309.90 → 3311.26] Some of you have gone through
[3311.26 → 3313.00] or are going through health concerns
[3313.00 → 3314.62] that I've never had to endure.
[3316.36 → 3318.22] Some of you have suffered loss
[3318.22 → 3318.92] in your life
[3318.92 → 3321.60] that I have never had to experience
[3321.60 → 3322.74] and cannot comprehend.
[3322.74 → 3325.88] Some of you have walked
[3325.88 → 3328.00] barefoot through hell and back
[3328.00 → 3329.70] and have witnessed loved ones
[3329.70 → 3331.58] crumble and fall
[3331.58 → 3333.80] or have broken down yourselves
[3333.80 → 3335.56] because of the context
[3335.56 → 3336.80] that you find yourselves in.
[3338.50 → 3340.52] And all I can do is sit and listen
[3340.52 → 3341.68] and be present with you
[3341.68 → 3342.50] and pray with you,
[3342.90 → 3344.78] but I can't understand
[3344.78 → 3345.82] the depths of your suffering
[3345.82 → 3346.38] or your pain.
[3346.38 → 3349.72] So if you're sitting there thinking,
[3350.58 → 3351.32] yeah, Kevin, sure,
[3351.46 → 3352.34] but you don't know.
[3353.34 → 3353.78] You're right.
[3354.48 → 3355.62] I haven't gone through
[3355.62 → 3356.84] the same things that you have.
[3357.34 → 3359.20] And I would never claim to know
[3359.20 → 3361.16] what you are going through.
[3361.16 → 3364.36] But I can say
[3364.36 → 3366.16] with certainty
[3366.16 → 3367.90] because of the power
[3367.90 → 3369.50] and authority of God's Word
[3369.50 → 3371.36] that in those dark times
[3371.36 → 3372.44] that you faced,
[3372.54 → 3374.24] the times that I cannot comprehend,
[3375.44 → 3377.86] the Lord was with you.
[3379.10 → 3380.14] While the depths
[3380.14 → 3381.18] and the pain
[3381.18 → 3382.14] and the suffering
[3382.14 → 3383.22] that you've gone through
[3383.22 → 3383.68] was deep,
[3383.94 → 3385.14] our living God
[3385.14 → 3386.26] went through them with you.
[3387.24 → 3387.98] He was there.
[3387.98 → 3390.92] That's the big idea today.
[3391.86 → 3393.28] You are not alone.
[3394.56 → 3396.96] God is with you always.
[3399.52 → 3401.00] When Joseph was a slave,
[3401.12 → 3401.76] God was with him.
[3402.52 → 3403.68] And he prospered.
[3404.62 → 3406.36] When Joseph was sent to prison,
[3407.42 → 3408.44] God was with him.
[3409.04 → 3410.44] And he was granted favour.
[3412.92 → 3414.18] God was with Joseph
[3414.18 → 3415.18] even in slavery
[3415.18 → 3416.66] and in imprisonment.
[3417.02 → 3417.32] However,
[3417.32 → 3417.80] there's something
[3417.80 → 3418.86] that needs your attention here.
[3418.92 → 3419.30] Something that needs
[3419.30 → 3420.34] all of our attention here.
[3420.40 → 3422.04] It's easy to look at the story
[3422.04 → 3422.92] and read it and think,
[3423.00 → 3424.08] oh, God was with him
[3424.08 → 3425.56] and gave him favour.
[3426.28 → 3427.54] Oh, God was with him
[3427.54 → 3428.84] and gave him kindness
[3428.84 → 3429.76] and prosperity.
[3430.34 → 3431.84] As if God's presence
[3431.84 → 3432.86] must include
[3432.86 → 3434.14] some kind of prosperity
[3434.14 → 3434.90] in your life.
[3436.10 → 3437.16] And we can read the story
[3437.16 → 3438.30] and we can falsely conclude
[3438.30 → 3439.30] that if prosperity
[3439.30 → 3440.22] is not present,
[3440.58 → 3441.22] well, then God
[3441.22 → 3442.32] must not be present either.
[3443.54 → 3444.90] But that's just not true.
[3444.90 → 3447.66] prosperity and presence
[3447.66 → 3448.46] don't correlate.
[3449.58 → 3449.98] Remember,
[3450.08 → 3451.08] even in this story,
[3451.58 → 3452.96] even in this story,
[3453.26 → 3454.56] Joseph was still a slave.
[3455.32 → 3456.68] He was still a prisoner.
[3457.38 → 3458.40] He was still out
[3458.40 → 3459.34] of his father's house.
[3459.58 → 3460.26] He was still living
[3460.26 → 3460.76] in a land
[3460.76 → 3461.76] that was foreign to him.
[3463.64 → 3465.40] And so favour and prosperity,
[3465.66 → 3466.56] even in this context,
[3466.64 → 3467.14] is relative.
[3467.14 → 3470.10] But the Lord was with him.
[3471.66 → 3472.98] Prosperity does not correlate
[3472.98 → 3473.78] with presence.
[3473.88 → 3475.36] The Bible has so many examples
[3475.36 → 3476.38] of God's presence
[3476.38 → 3477.46] with his people
[3477.46 → 3478.90] despite a complete lack
[3478.90 → 3479.56] of prosperity.
[3480.34 → 3481.82] Think of people like Elijah
[3481.82 → 3482.90] or Jeremiah
[3482.90 → 3484.02] or Ruth.
[3484.20 → 3484.98] There's lots more.
[3486.24 → 3487.54] Joseph was favoured by God.
[3487.62 → 3487.80] Yes,
[3488.12 → 3489.36] even in his suffering.
[3491.66 → 3493.16] By his faithfulness,
[3493.24 → 3494.20] he garnered favour
[3494.20 → 3495.36] in both Rotifer's house
[3495.36 → 3496.34] and in prison.
[3496.34 → 3497.92] But earlier in the story,
[3498.44 → 3499.80] God was present with him still,
[3500.06 → 3500.66] even when he was
[3500.66 → 3501.54] in the bottom of that well.
[3503.66 → 3504.34] In his richest
[3504.34 → 3505.28] and in his poorest,
[3505.42 → 3506.00] his abundance
[3506.00 → 3506.78] and his loss,
[3506.84 → 3507.46] in his blessing
[3507.46 → 3508.50] and his suffering,
[3508.78 → 3509.94] God was with Joseph.
[3511.08 → 3512.02] Even after he was
[3512.02 → 3512.88] falsely accused,
[3513.04 → 3514.14] when no one believed him,
[3514.28 → 3515.02] and he was lonely
[3515.02 → 3515.60] once again,
[3516.42 → 3517.30] Joseph was in fact
[3517.30 → 3517.82] not alone.
[3520.72 → 3521.92] I've never been a slave
[3521.92 → 3522.62] or a prisoner.
[3522.76 → 3523.02] Apparently,
[3523.12 → 3523.64] none of our kids
[3523.64 → 3524.44] have ever been prisoners
[3524.44 → 3524.84] either.
[3526.34 → 3527.44] But I do think
[3527.44 → 3528.56] loneliness is something
[3528.56 → 3529.96] that we can all relate to.
[3531.78 → 3532.48] I know I've had.
[3532.50 → 3533.20] I've had an experience
[3533.20 → 3533.68] in my life
[3533.68 → 3534.38] where I was very lonely.
[3534.50 → 3535.14] There was this season
[3535.14 → 3536.02] in life where I felt
[3536.02 → 3536.88] incredibly alone.
[3537.00 → 3537.84] It was the year
[3537.84 → 3538.62] after I graduated
[3538.62 → 3539.34] from high school.
[3539.58 → 3541.06] I did all my schooling
[3541.06 → 3542.46] in Victoria, B.C.
[3542.84 → 3543.88] and I moved from Victoria
[3543.88 → 3544.46] to Edmonton
[3544.46 → 3545.42] right after I graduated.
[3546.24 → 3547.16] I needed a job
[3547.16 → 3547.64] and I ended up
[3547.64 → 3548.56] finding one pretty quick
[3548.56 → 3549.82] at a local grocery store,
[3549.88 → 3550.50] but my job
[3550.50 → 3551.68] was to stock shelves
[3551.68 → 3552.74] and face the groceries,
[3552.90 → 3553.64] turn the labels out
[3553.64 → 3554.52] so everyone could read them.
[3554.52 → 3555.62] And I had to do that job
[3555.62 → 3556.82] from 11 p.m.
[3556.98 → 3558.04] until 8 a.m.
[3558.04 → 3558.94] That was my shift.
[3559.42 → 3560.12] And my schedule
[3560.12 → 3560.84] was not like
[3560.84 → 3561.68] a consistent one.
[3561.76 → 3562.18] It wasn't like
[3562.18 → 3562.94] I worked four days
[3562.94 → 3563.64] and had two off
[3563.64 → 3564.28] or five days
[3564.28 → 3564.80] and two off.
[3565.00 → 3565.52] It was like
[3565.52 → 3566.58] I worked two,
[3566.68 → 3567.22] got one off,
[3567.28 → 3567.64] worked three,
[3567.72 → 3568.18] got one off.
[3568.22 → 3568.68] I could never
[3568.68 → 3569.76] readjust my schedule
[3569.76 → 3571.12] and so I didn't see
[3571.12 → 3571.98] the light of day
[3571.98 → 3572.96] because it was Edmonton
[3572.96 → 3575.44] for like six months.
[3577.18 → 3578.36] The job was fine,
[3579.36 → 3580.58] but because my schedule
[3580.58 → 3581.28] was so irregular,
[3581.44 → 3582.36] the only people I saw
[3582.36 → 3583.10] was the two dudes
[3583.10 → 3584.14] that I stocked shelves with
[3584.14 → 3584.70] and they were both
[3584.70 → 3585.64] kind of grumpy old men
[3585.64 → 3586.10] who just wanted
[3586.10 → 3587.10] to punch in and punch out.
[3587.52 → 3588.92] They were not conversationalists.
[3589.50 → 3590.78] I could barely go to church.
[3591.36 → 3592.92] I knew nobody in the city.
[3593.62 → 3594.26] I couldn't even really
[3594.26 → 3595.10] see my own family.
[3596.48 → 3597.48] And for half a year,
[3597.54 → 3598.60] I barely talked to anyone.
[3599.34 → 3600.26] It was very lonely.
[3601.26 → 3602.44] I was probably depressed.
[3603.78 → 3604.66] It was a very,
[3604.80 → 3605.74] very hard season for me.
[3605.74 → 3608.16] I'd gone from a very
[3608.16 → 3611.36] super social grade 12 grad year
[3611.36 → 3612.92] with lots of activities
[3612.92 → 3614.96] to nothing.
[3617.16 → 3618.38] It was strange though
[3618.38 → 3619.68] because during that time,
[3619.78 → 3621.32] my faith in God
[3621.32 → 3622.72] actually grew.
[3623.44 → 3624.32] And some of this
[3624.32 → 3626.34] I'm realizing in retrospect.
[3627.42 → 3630.10] But my prayer life grew.
[3630.28 → 3631.40] I wasn't talking to anyone,
[3631.52 → 3632.54] so God became someone
[3632.54 → 3633.20] that I spoke to.
[3633.58 → 3634.86] I started opening my Bible
[3634.86 → 3635.62] a little bit more
[3635.62 → 3636.64] because the world around me
[3636.64 → 3637.86] was very small,
[3638.10 → 3639.52] so I had no reason not to.
[3641.36 → 3642.14] I'm not sure
[3642.14 → 3642.82] I would have said this
[3642.82 → 3643.18] back then,
[3643.24 → 3644.08] but I know with the gift
[3644.08 → 3644.56] of retrospect
[3644.56 → 3645.92] that even though
[3645.92 → 3646.70] I was lonely,
[3646.82 → 3647.94] I knew God was there.
[3649.20 → 3650.66] I desired Him more.
[3650.78 → 3651.70] I leaned into
[3651.70 → 3652.66] His presence more.
[3652.86 → 3654.56] And it didn't make things good.
[3654.96 → 3656.36] Life still sucked for me then.
[3658.86 → 3659.80] But God was there.
[3659.80 → 3661.10] And I do remember
[3661.10 → 3662.28] in the midst of that loneliness,
[3662.88 → 3664.20] God's presence was tangible.
[3664.82 → 3665.44] He was with me.
[3665.50 → 3667.84] I was never actually alone.
[3668.04 → 3670.68] See, God is always with us.
[3674.32 → 3676.08] God's presence in our lives,
[3676.56 → 3678.88] it means we can be bolstered up
[3678.88 → 3679.88] to face the suffering
[3679.88 → 3681.34] that we endure with courage.
[3681.54 → 3682.32] Now, I'm not saying
[3682.32 → 3683.40] that I faced that season
[3683.40 → 3684.44] of loneliness with courage,
[3684.44 → 3685.66] but I do think
[3685.66 → 3686.80] a more mature version of me
[3686.80 → 3687.22] eventually,
[3687.68 → 3688.32] like right now,
[3688.40 → 3689.50] might be able to do that.
[3691.00 → 3692.78] Because Scripture tells us we can.
[3693.98 → 3695.28] In fact, Paul tells us
[3695.28 → 3696.20] that with Christ,
[3696.32 → 3697.52] we can even delight
[3697.52 → 3698.68] in our suffering.
[3700.42 → 3700.84] Isn't that something?
[3700.94 → 3702.18] Read 2 Corinthians 12,
[3702.24 → 3703.10] verses 9 to 10
[3703.10 → 3703.86] with me for a moment.
[3704.20 → 3705.34] 2 Corinthians 12,
[3705.82 → 3707.04] 9 to 10 says this,
[3707.04 → 3708.78] But he said to me,
[3708.86 → 3710.64] My grace is sufficient for you,
[3710.88 → 3712.18] for my power is made
[3712.18 → 3713.48] perfect in weakness.
[3713.48 → 3714.86] Therefore I,
[3714.92 → 3716.04] and this is Paul speaking,
[3716.16 → 3717.60] Therefore I will boast
[3717.60 → 3718.60] all the more gladly
[3718.60 → 3719.44] about my weaknesses
[3719.44 → 3721.04] so that Christ's power
[3721.04 → 3722.12] may rest on me.
[3722.94 → 3723.58] And hear this,
[3723.90 → 3724.76] That is why,
[3725.20 → 3726.18] for Christ's sake,
[3726.60 → 3728.88] I delight in weaknesses,
[3729.60 → 3730.80] in insults,
[3731.14 → 3732.06] in hardships,
[3732.52 → 3733.78] in persecutions,
[3734.34 → 3735.22] and in difficulties.
[3735.94 → 3737.66] For when I am weak,
[3738.38 → 3740.22] then I am strong.
[3741.62 → 3743.40] For Christ's sake,
[3743.48 → 3744.70] we can delight
[3744.70 → 3745.60] in weaknesses,
[3746.22 → 3746.82] insults,
[3747.04 → 3747.48] hardships,
[3747.74 → 3748.36] persecutions,
[3748.44 → 3749.06] and difficulties.
[3751.00 → 3752.34] Now as Josh or Chris
[3752.34 → 3753.24] would have me point out,
[3753.32 → 3754.54] the Greek word for delight
[3754.54 → 3755.38] here is important.
[3756.28 → 3757.24] The Greek word
[3757.24 → 3758.50] is audio,
[3758.86 → 3759.68] which to me sounds like
[3759.68 → 3760.44] some sort of Pokémon,
[3760.66 → 3761.76] but it actually means
[3761.76 → 3763.02] to be content
[3763.02 → 3765.56] or to choose as better.
[3765.56 → 3767.72] So Paul is saying
[3767.72 → 3769.12] to be content
[3769.12 → 3770.66] in our suffering.
[3771.48 → 3772.02] Or rather,
[3772.30 → 3773.52] to choose the suffering
[3773.52 → 3774.18] that we face
[3774.18 → 3775.10] knowing that it is better
[3775.10 → 3775.56] for us
[3775.56 → 3777.02] because when we are weak,
[3777.36 → 3778.84] we allow Christ's presence
[3778.84 → 3780.04] or Christ's power
[3780.04 → 3781.58] and Christ in general
[3781.58 → 3782.52] to be the focal point
[3782.52 → 3783.12] in our lives.
[3783.90 → 3784.78] When we suffer,
[3784.88 → 3786.08] we can lean into Christ
[3786.08 → 3787.12] because we know
[3787.12 → 3788.30] he suffered.
[3788.30 → 3790.64] I sometimes think
[3790.64 → 3791.20] we forget
[3791.20 → 3792.42] just how much suffering
[3792.42 → 3793.56] Jesus had to endure.
[3793.86 → 3794.00] See,
[3794.06 → 3795.54] he lived this perfect life,
[3795.58 → 3796.42] a life that you and I
[3796.42 → 3797.04] fail to live
[3797.04 → 3797.92] each and every day
[3797.92 → 3799.00] and then Jesus died
[3799.00 → 3800.64] an unbelievably
[3800.64 → 3802.58] excruciating death
[3802.58 → 3803.54] that we deserve
[3803.54 → 3804.32] because of our sin
[3804.32 → 3804.94] and brokenness.
[3805.94 → 3807.14] And he bore the weight
[3807.14 → 3809.34] of all of human sin
[3809.34 → 3811.02] throughout all of human history
[3811.02 → 3811.68] on his shoulders.
[3811.80 → 3812.52] Think about that.
[3812.52 → 3814.96] bearing the wrath of God
[3814.96 → 3816.28] for the weight
[3816.28 → 3817.14] of the sin
[3817.14 → 3818.04] of humanity
[3818.04 → 3819.16] throughout history.
[3820.84 → 3822.48] He was flogged,
[3823.76 → 3824.08] beaten,
[3824.74 → 3825.32] stripped,
[3826.10 → 3826.74] stabbed,
[3827.00 → 3827.34] pierced.
[3827.40 → 3828.72] He was hung on a cross.
[3829.42 → 3830.34] He suffocated.
[3831.54 → 3832.78] He was forsaken.
[3835.44 → 3838.40] Jesus knew suffering.
[3838.40 → 3842.74] But he also knows
[3842.74 → 3843.50] victory.
[3844.68 → 3845.80] Because three days later
[3845.80 → 3847.46] he rose triumphantly
[3847.46 → 3848.06] from the grave
[3848.06 → 3848.68] and now through
[3848.68 → 3849.50] the Holy Spirit
[3849.50 → 3851.78] Jesus is with us
[3851.78 → 3853.56] in our suffering too.
[3853.98 → 3854.92] Jesus reigns
[3854.92 → 3855.76] on the throne
[3855.76 → 3856.88] over all creation
[3856.88 → 3858.64] and yet he sits with us
[3858.64 → 3859.64] when we suffer
[3859.64 → 3861.40] knowing what pain
[3861.40 → 3862.22] and suffering
[3862.22 → 3863.08] and loneliness
[3863.08 → 3863.84] feels like
[3863.84 → 3865.12] because he lived it too.
[3866.36 → 3867.36] He understands
[3867.36 → 3869.00] what we're going through
[3869.00 → 3872.08] and he is constantly present.
[3874.24 → 3875.20] Taking delight
[3875.20 → 3875.84] in our suffering
[3875.84 → 3876.78] means to choose
[3876.78 → 3877.98] to see Jesus
[3877.98 → 3879.06] in the midst
[3879.06 → 3879.82] of hard times
[3879.82 → 3881.72] because he is there.
[3882.64 → 3883.64] It's not that we have
[3883.64 → 3884.30] to rejoice
[3884.30 → 3885.12] in our suffering
[3885.12 → 3887.94] but we sure can persevere
[3887.94 → 3889.16] knowing that we are not alone.
[3890.46 → 3891.82] God is present
[3891.82 → 3892.62] just like he was
[3892.62 → 3893.18] with Joseph.
[3893.18 → 3897.60] One of the ways
[3897.60 → 3898.72] that God is present
[3898.72 → 3899.70] in our lives
[3899.70 → 3901.04] is through his people
[3901.04 → 3901.86] through the church.
[3903.54 → 3904.40] If the church
[3904.40 → 3905.38] is Christ's body
[3905.38 → 3906.78] and if we have
[3906.78 → 3907.60] the Holy Spirit
[3907.60 → 3908.66] in us
[3908.66 → 3910.68] we are a means
[3910.68 → 3911.88] or we are a picture
[3911.88 → 3913.30] of God's presence
[3913.30 → 3914.10] here in this world.
[3914.86 → 3915.56] The church
[3915.56 → 3916.46] is a way
[3916.46 → 3918.60] that God's presence
[3918.60 → 3919.12] is revealed
[3919.12 → 3919.74] in this world.
[3920.34 → 3921.56] On a macro level
[3921.56 → 3922.26] if you look
[3922.26 → 3922.82] throughout history
[3922.82 → 3923.44] you can see this.
[3923.54 → 3924.16] God's presence
[3924.16 → 3925.36] is evident
[3925.36 → 3926.38] everywhere
[3926.38 → 3927.26] because of the work
[3927.26 → 3928.26] of his people
[3928.26 → 3929.58] or sorry
[3929.58 → 3930.58] because of his work
[3930.58 → 3931.46] through his people.
[3932.28 → 3933.02] God's people
[3933.02 → 3933.42] Christians
[3933.42 → 3934.14] they've initiated
[3934.14 → 3934.94] so many things.
[3935.34 → 3935.82] Orphanages
[3935.82 → 3936.40] hospitals
[3936.40 → 3937.22] medical systems
[3937.22 → 3937.78] universities
[3937.78 → 3938.36] crisis
[3938.36 → 3939.84] intervention agencies
[3939.84 → 3941.82] refugee initiatives
[3941.82 → 3942.62] homeless shelters
[3942.62 → 3943.48] rehab centres
[3943.48 → 3944.92] so many things
[3944.92 → 3945.60] in this world
[3945.60 → 3947.72] God initiated
[3947.72 → 3948.40] through his people.
[3948.80 → 3949.18] We see them
[3949.18 → 3949.60] every day
[3949.60 → 3950.44] we use them
[3950.44 → 3951.02] every day.
[3951.02 → 3953.82] God's presence
[3953.82 → 3954.96] visible in the midst
[3954.96 → 3955.48] of suffering.
[3956.98 → 3958.38] But we can zoom in
[3958.38 → 3959.42] and see it locally too.
[3960.06 → 3961.46] Zoom into this place here.
[3962.14 → 3962.76] I could tell you
[3962.76 → 3963.64] countless stories
[3963.64 → 3964.22] of you
[3964.22 → 3965.24] of God's people
[3965.24 → 3966.12] here at Emmanuel
[3966.12 → 3968.14] being present
[3968.14 → 3969.68] in the midst
[3969.68 → 3970.24] of suffering.
[3971.02 → 3971.96] Whether it's
[3971.96 → 3972.70] prayers
[3972.70 → 3973.92] or lament services
[3973.92 → 3974.62] it's meals
[3974.62 → 3975.22] for people
[3975.22 → 3976.88] it's care groups
[3976.88 → 3978.10] it's labour
[3978.10 → 3978.70] and time
[3978.70 → 3979.30] and energy
[3979.30 → 3980.20] and service.
[3981.94 → 3982.46] There's
[3982.46 → 3983.62] so much
[3983.62 → 3984.94] giving
[3984.94 → 3986.04] of ourselves
[3986.04 → 3987.42] being God's
[3987.42 → 3987.76] presence
[3987.76 → 3988.36] in the midst
[3988.36 → 3989.20] of each other
[3989.20 → 3990.58] who are going
[3990.58 → 3991.06] through hardships.
[3991.30 → 3992.24] You are his hands
[3992.24 → 3992.64] and feet.
[3993.14 → 3993.98] You are being used
[3993.98 → 3995.40] by our Holy Father
[3995.40 → 3996.58] to be his presence
[3996.58 → 3997.70] in the face of hardships
[3997.70 → 3998.88] here in Langley.
[3999.14 → 4000.06] The benevolence fund
[4000.06 → 4001.30] that you just gave to
[4001.30 → 4002.18] is doing that.
[4002.48 → 4002.98] The deacons
[4002.98 → 4003.82] are doing this work.
[4003.90 → 4004.28] The elders
[4004.28 → 4005.08] are doing this work.
[4005.38 → 4006.30] All the ministries
[4006.30 → 4007.36] here are doing this work.
[4007.36 → 4008.26] It is happening.
[4012.60 → 4013.76] But we also know
[4013.76 → 4014.46] that this narrative
[4014.46 → 4015.48] is not always true.
[4017.84 → 4018.94] Yes, that is one
[4018.94 → 4020.12] glorious side
[4020.12 → 4020.60] of the coin.
[4022.02 → 4022.82] But there are
[4022.82 → 4023.72] so many stories
[4023.72 → 4024.46] throughout history
[4024.46 → 4026.90] of the church
[4026.90 → 4027.64] not being
[4027.64 → 4028.24] God's hands
[4028.24 → 4028.64] and feet.
[4029.48 → 4029.86] In fact,
[4030.20 → 4030.92] many people
[4030.92 → 4031.44] who have walked
[4031.44 → 4032.50] away from the church
[4032.50 → 4033.10] do so because
[4033.10 → 4033.60] the church
[4033.60 → 4034.64] has hurt them
[4034.64 → 4035.54] so badly.
[4037.42 → 4038.30] This is also
[4038.30 → 4038.86] the reality
[4038.86 → 4039.46] of history.
[4043.06 → 4043.62] Unfortunately,
[4044.94 → 4047.08] just like prosperity
[4047.08 → 4048.28] is not a sign
[4048.28 → 4049.26] of God's presence,
[4050.46 → 4051.62] sometimes the actions
[4051.62 → 4052.32] of Christians
[4052.32 → 4053.60] sure make God
[4053.60 → 4054.40] seem far away.
[4056.40 → 4056.86] Christians are
[4056.86 → 4057.38] as fallible
[4057.38 → 4057.84] as anyone.
[4058.56 → 4059.92] Sin entangles
[4059.92 → 4060.70] us all
[4060.70 → 4061.12] and anyone
[4061.12 → 4061.68] is capable
[4061.68 → 4062.18] of hurting
[4062.18 → 4062.64] and harming
[4062.64 → 4063.28] those around them.
[4063.28 → 4064.48] Just as suffering
[4064.48 → 4065.60] touches us all
[4065.60 → 4066.56] so does the ability
[4066.56 → 4067.84] to hurt others.
[4069.68 → 4070.40] There's a saying
[4070.40 → 4070.68] out there,
[4070.74 → 4071.46] maybe some of you
[4071.46 → 4071.86] have heard it,
[4071.90 → 4072.52] many, many of you
[4072.52 → 4073.00] have heard it.
[4073.72 → 4074.46] Hurt people
[4074.46 → 4075.82] hurt people.
[4076.36 → 4077.14] We heard that one
[4077.14 → 4077.46] before?
[4077.84 → 4078.44] Hurt people
[4078.44 → 4079.58] hurt people.
[4081.46 → 4082.36] But if everyone
[4082.36 → 4082.90] is hurt,
[4084.28 → 4085.66] that means we all,
[4085.74 → 4086.26] no matter what
[4086.26 → 4086.74] we believe,
[4086.82 → 4087.32] have the ability
[4087.32 → 4088.00] to hurt people.
[4088.00 → 4089.42] It's not a justification
[4089.42 → 4090.38] for our actions.
[4090.52 → 4091.62] Please don't hear that.
[4092.22 → 4093.24] But it is a reason
[4093.24 → 4094.36] why we see this.
[4094.42 → 4095.06] And while the church
[4095.06 → 4095.98] is a place
[4095.98 → 4096.64] that should be
[4096.64 → 4097.64] the presence of God,
[4097.78 → 4099.00] it can also be a place
[4099.00 → 4099.60] where suffering
[4099.60 → 4100.32] is experienced.
[4100.88 → 4101.58] And that makes
[4101.58 → 4102.32] a sermon like this
[4102.32 → 4102.80] difficult.
[4103.74 → 4105.04] Because on the one hand,
[4105.30 → 4106.40] I know that the church
[4106.40 → 4107.40] is a picture of God's
[4107.40 → 4108.22] presence here on earth.
[4109.22 → 4110.04] We see it.
[4110.12 → 4110.68] We've seen it
[4110.68 → 4111.34] throughout history.
[4113.12 → 4114.30] But on the other hand,
[4115.06 → 4116.14] I know that the church
[4116.14 → 4116.74] has been a place
[4116.74 → 4117.72] that has compounded
[4117.72 → 4118.48] and even created
[4118.48 → 4119.18] hurt as well.
[4122.56 → 4123.18] And yet,
[4123.30 → 4124.74] Scripture tells us
[4124.74 → 4125.90] to delight
[4125.90 → 4127.12] in our suffering.
[4129.28 → 4129.68] How?
[4132.34 → 4133.62] Well, maybe this place,
[4134.54 → 4135.12] maybe church,
[4135.22 → 4136.26] maybe this place,
[4136.62 → 4137.22] although it can
[4137.22 → 4138.32] bring hurt,
[4138.40 → 4139.08] maybe it's a place
[4139.08 → 4139.78] we lean into.
[4140.74 → 4141.70] Because people here,
[4141.78 → 4142.50] all of us,
[4142.88 → 4143.86] are broken too.
[4144.42 → 4144.66] Right?
[4145.12 → 4146.18] And in our brokenness,
[4146.18 → 4147.34] it maybe means
[4147.34 → 4148.26] we belong together.
[4149.70 → 4151.08] If we are all hurt,
[4151.14 → 4152.44] maybe we can hurt together.
[4153.30 → 4154.16] If the church
[4154.16 → 4154.88] is a place
[4154.88 → 4155.60] where hurt people
[4155.60 → 4156.08] are welcome,
[4156.52 → 4157.82] and sinners are welcome,
[4158.10 → 4159.16] and broken people
[4159.16 → 4159.64] are welcome,
[4159.92 → 4160.72] and if church
[4160.72 → 4161.84] is a place
[4161.84 → 4163.54] where these same people
[4163.54 → 4164.52] can offer love
[4164.52 → 4165.40] and support
[4165.40 → 4166.78] and care for one another,
[4167.74 → 4168.82] maybe it's a place
[4168.82 → 4170.54] where you can come.
[4171.54 → 4172.36] All of you,
[4172.42 → 4173.00] in your pain,
[4173.16 → 4173.74] and you're suffering,
[4173.84 → 4174.22] all of you,
[4174.22 → 4174.84] your whole story,
[4174.90 → 4176.30] maybe it's a place,
[4177.02 → 4177.94] and more importantly,
[4178.04 → 4178.96] maybe it's a people
[4178.96 → 4181.18] that you can lean into
[4181.18 → 4181.68] as well.
[4183.60 → 4184.84] You can be a part of it.
[4185.74 → 4187.02] You can be a part of us.
[4187.26 → 4188.78] Maybe in our hurt,
[4188.92 → 4189.76] maybe in our suffering,
[4189.88 → 4191.92] maybe the broken vessels
[4191.92 → 4194.44] found here at Emanuel CRC
[4194.44 → 4196.72] or in the church global
[4196.72 → 4199.08] are the exact kind of people
[4199.08 → 4200.20] that will resonate with you.
[4200.20 → 4205.06] Maybe God can use even us
[4205.06 → 4206.24] to help you,
[4206.74 → 4209.30] or maybe God could use
[4209.30 → 4211.26] even you to help us.
[4213.02 → 4213.90] Because like I said,
[4213.96 → 4214.74] history has shown us
[4214.74 → 4215.86] that while the church
[4215.86 → 4216.60] has been a place
[4216.60 → 4217.38] that has hurt people,
[4218.12 → 4219.80] it is also a place
[4219.80 → 4220.80] that has transformed
[4220.80 → 4221.94] the world and culture
[4221.94 → 4222.84] that we live in,
[4224.04 → 4224.98] transformed people
[4224.98 → 4226.38] in this room here today.
[4226.38 → 4229.50] Church matters.
[4230.26 → 4231.64] Community matters.
[4233.88 → 4234.96] The rest of my story
[4234.96 → 4236.66] actually shares this too.
[4236.80 → 4237.98] That was a rough year
[4237.98 → 4238.46] in Edmonton.
[4238.56 → 4239.28] It was a lonely year
[4239.28 → 4239.76] in Edmonton.
[4239.88 → 4241.04] I didn't have community
[4241.04 → 4241.88] for a long time,
[4242.48 → 4243.40] but then I started
[4243.40 → 4244.40] to go to church.
[4244.58 → 4245.38] It was put on my heart
[4245.38 → 4245.96] to do that no matter
[4245.96 → 4246.80] how tired I was
[4246.80 → 4247.86] or how bright the sun was.
[4248.94 → 4249.72] And so I started going
[4249.72 → 4250.42] to church a little bit
[4250.42 → 4250.90] more frequently.
[4251.76 → 4253.04] I started seeing my family
[4253.04 → 4254.38] a little bit more regularly.
[4255.10 → 4255.74] Through that family,
[4255.74 → 4256.58] I got a new job.
[4256.66 → 4257.32] No more night shifts.
[4257.38 → 4258.20] I was working days.
[4258.96 → 4259.62] I got to be part
[4259.62 → 4260.62] of the community more.
[4260.74 → 4261.82] I got to see God's people
[4261.82 → 4262.68] a little more regularly.
[4262.82 → 4264.26] My cousin visited once
[4264.26 → 4264.96] for dinner, and he brought
[4264.96 → 4265.42] his girlfriend,
[4265.56 → 4266.62] who I had never met before.
[4266.76 → 4267.28] They're married now.
[4267.32 → 4267.88] They live in Michigan.
[4269.46 → 4271.26] And his girlfriend at the time
[4271.26 → 4272.32] was talking to us at dinner
[4272.32 → 4273.12] and she asked what I was
[4273.12 → 4273.92] going to be doing next year.
[4273.94 → 4274.60] I said, oh, I'm probably
[4274.60 → 4275.40] going to go to King's.
[4275.46 → 4276.90] I want to do Christian education.
[4277.20 → 4278.06] I can live at home
[4278.06 → 4278.72] and just commute.
[4278.82 → 4279.24] It'll be great.
[4279.58 → 4280.18] And she's like, oh,
[4280.20 → 4281.18] you seem like the kind of person
[4281.18 → 4282.18] who would desire community
[4282.18 → 4283.28] and want to live on campus.
[4283.28 → 4283.96] And I was like,
[4283.96 → 4286.22] oh, I am that kind of person.
[4287.20 → 4288.44] And so through very little
[4288.44 → 4289.20] words of her own
[4289.20 → 4290.22] and very little convincing,
[4290.48 → 4291.86] I signed up and registered
[4291.86 → 4292.52] to go to Redeemer.
[4292.68 → 4293.92] I went there with no plan.
[4294.40 → 4295.06] I had no idea
[4295.06 → 4295.74] what I was going to take
[4295.74 → 4296.86] and I know not a soul there,
[4296.94 → 4297.50] but I went
[4297.50 → 4299.82] to live on campus.
[4302.10 → 4303.12] God used Redeemer
[4303.12 → 4303.80] to bring me here,
[4303.88 → 4304.34] to Emmanuel.
[4304.58 → 4305.76] God, through his people,
[4305.88 → 4306.30] are the reason
[4306.30 → 4306.94] that I'm here today.
[4307.04 → 4308.20] I made some amazing
[4308.20 → 4308.72] friends there.
[4308.78 → 4309.80] I had people pointing me
[4309.80 → 4310.44] to Jesus there.
[4310.44 → 4311.82] I met my wife there.
[4311.82 → 4313.34] They directed me
[4313.34 → 4314.20] to where I am today.
[4314.32 → 4315.12] They directed me
[4315.12 → 4315.64] to Jesus.
[4318.12 → 4319.34] Through his people,
[4319.92 → 4321.00] God brought me here.
[4321.06 → 4321.58] It's the reason
[4321.58 → 4322.26] I'm here today.
[4323.58 → 4324.10] And here,
[4324.24 → 4325.10] so many people
[4325.10 → 4326.10] continue to point me
[4326.10 → 4326.64] to Christ.
[4327.68 → 4328.30] They continue
[4328.30 → 4329.34] to walk alongside me
[4329.34 → 4330.16] when I struggle,
[4330.96 → 4332.16] when I go through hard times.
[4332.20 → 4332.58] And maybe,
[4332.78 → 4334.40] maybe that's the right place
[4334.40 → 4335.04] to end today.
[4337.20 → 4338.72] The Lord was with Joseph.
[4340.34 → 4340.78] Always.
[4340.78 → 4343.36] And he's with us too.
[4344.28 → 4345.22] By his spirit,
[4345.30 → 4346.70] in his word that we read,
[4347.34 → 4348.44] and through his church.
[4350.62 → 4351.64] So what do we take away
[4351.64 → 4352.10] from this?
[4353.86 → 4354.20] I think,
[4354.28 → 4354.88] I hope
[4354.88 → 4356.32] that we can remember,
[4356.46 → 4357.14] even in the midst
[4357.14 → 4358.04] of the darkest suffering
[4358.04 → 4358.52] we go through,
[4358.56 → 4359.34] that we are not alone.
[4360.26 → 4361.62] That God is with us.
[4363.52 → 4364.52] And so however,
[4365.14 → 4366.66] whatever capacity we have,
[4367.32 → 4369.32] let's lean into that presence.
[4369.42 → 4370.36] Are we leaning in,
[4370.36 → 4371.34] or are we pulling away?
[4372.62 → 4373.86] He's with you always,
[4373.96 → 4374.68] but are you with him?
[4375.20 → 4375.76] That could mean
[4375.76 → 4377.08] a whole host of things.
[4378.00 → 4379.10] But how are you leaning
[4379.10 → 4380.52] into God's presence today?
[4381.86 → 4382.60] For Joseph,
[4382.96 → 4385.00] he kept living his life
[4385.00 → 4386.28] faithfully
[4386.28 → 4387.50] to the God that he served.
[4388.58 → 4389.52] He knew he couldn't
[4389.52 → 4390.16] sin against God,
[4390.20 → 4390.88] and so he didn't.
[4390.98 → 4392.10] And yet he suffered for it.
[4394.86 → 4395.30] For us,
[4395.34 → 4395.78] that could look like
[4395.78 → 4396.32] all sorts of things.
[4396.40 → 4396.84] Maybe for us,
[4396.84 → 4397.42] it's reaching out
[4397.42 → 4398.10] to someone here
[4398.10 → 4399.34] or elsewhere,
[4399.34 → 4400.58] even if your impulse
[4400.58 → 4402.08] is to withdraw
[4402.08 → 4403.92] rather than press in.
[4404.42 → 4405.02] Maybe for you,
[4405.12 → 4406.02] it's to worship
[4406.02 → 4406.82] a little bit more.
[4407.68 → 4408.82] Even in your daily rhythms,
[4408.94 → 4410.70] maybe that's in a musical way
[4410.70 → 4412.08] or prayerful ways
[4412.08 → 4413.56] or devotional ways
[4413.56 → 4414.72] or playful ways
[4414.72 → 4416.16] or relational ways
[4416.16 → 4417.54] or sacrificial ways.
[4418.82 → 4419.70] Maybe it just means
[4419.70 → 4420.86] worshipping a little bit more,
[4421.94 → 4423.04] making that a focal point
[4423.04 → 4423.54] of your life.
[4423.54 → 4426.22] Maybe it means
[4426.22 → 4427.60] finding your God places.
[4427.90 → 4429.72] What I mean by that is
[4429.72 → 4431.22] I mentioned earlier
[4431.22 → 4431.90] that I grew up
[4431.90 → 4432.44] on the island.
[4432.58 → 4434.58] I spent 13 or 14 years
[4434.58 → 4435.22] in Victoria.
[4435.76 → 4436.72] And on our drive to school
[4436.72 → 4437.50] every single morning,
[4437.58 → 4438.24] we kind of crested
[4438.24 → 4440.06] this hill on the way,
[4440.20 → 4441.64] and we had a really nice view
[4441.64 → 4442.28] of Mount Baker
[4442.28 → 4443.26] and the other Cascades
[4443.26 → 4443.82] in the distance
[4443.82 → 4444.50] as we did that.
[4445.06 → 4445.86] And my mom would say
[4445.86 → 4446.32] every morning
[4446.32 → 4446.92] when those mountains
[4446.92 → 4447.36] were visible,
[4447.46 → 4447.70] she'd be,
[4447.76 → 4448.90] oh, look at the mountains.
[4449.22 → 4449.72] And we kids
[4449.72 → 4450.38] would roll our eyes
[4450.38 → 4451.44] because moms are exhausting.
[4451.44 → 4454.72] But then I went
[4454.72 → 4455.58] to Edmonton later,
[4455.80 → 4456.52] and I lived there
[4456.52 → 4457.02] for a while,
[4457.22 → 4458.28] and that's sky country.
[4458.58 → 4459.54] That ain't mountain country.
[4460.08 → 4460.70] And then I moved
[4460.70 → 4461.32] to Hamilton,
[4461.58 → 4462.28] and the mountain
[4462.28 → 4462.88] that they have
[4462.88 → 4463.66] is this escarpment
[4463.66 → 4464.28] that takes like
[4464.28 → 4464.70] eight minutes
[4464.70 → 4465.32] to walk up
[4465.32 → 4466.52] in 250 steps
[4466.52 → 4466.96] or something.
[4468.40 → 4469.84] And now that I'm back here,
[4470.34 → 4472.04] I find myself saying,
[4472.34 → 4473.80] look at the mountains.
[4476.80 → 4477.78] The mountains
[4477.78 → 4481.22] are awe-inspiring to me.
[4481.44 → 4484.48] that's God's presence here.
[4486.40 → 4487.34] Maybe for you,
[4487.40 → 4487.88] it's a hike
[4487.88 → 4488.90] or a drive
[4488.90 → 4489.68] or a waterfall
[4489.68 → 4490.84] or an ocean
[4490.84 → 4493.02] or a fishing trip
[4493.02 → 4494.00] or a hammock
[4494.00 → 4494.50] in the woods.
[4495.64 → 4497.62] But where's your awe moment?
[4500.72 → 4502.26] Where does the magnitude
[4502.26 → 4505.14] of God capture you?
[4505.14 → 4508.14] Sometimes the magnitude
[4508.14 → 4510.10] of God's creation
[4510.10 → 4511.24] can help reorient
[4511.24 → 4512.26] our bad attitudes
[4512.26 → 4513.50] towards that same creation
[4513.50 → 4514.56] that we find ourselves in.
[4520.48 → 4522.52] God is with us.
[4523.10 → 4524.10] God is with you
[4524.10 → 4525.62] in your joys,
[4525.84 → 4526.10] yes,
[4526.60 → 4527.98] in your sorrows
[4527.98 → 4528.60] and suffering,
[4528.98 → 4529.32] yes,
[4529.66 → 4530.02] too.
[4531.14 → 4532.26] God is with you
[4532.26 → 4532.98] through His church,
[4532.98 → 4533.60] even if we're
[4533.60 → 4534.46] a broken people.
[4535.38 → 4536.78] Are we leaning in?
[4537.58 → 4538.54] Are we leaning in
[4538.54 → 4539.62] to the presence of God?
[4540.50 → 4541.56] Because He's there.
[4542.98 → 4545.26] You are not alone.
[4546.42 → 4548.72] God is with you.
[4549.84 → 4550.12] Amen.
[4550.74 → 4551.26] Let me pray.
[4551.94 → 4552.46] Amen.
[4554.52 → 4555.60] Father in heaven,
[4555.60 → 4558.66] we know that you are
[4558.66 → 4560.06] the creator of all things
[4560.06 → 4560.88] and you are present
[4560.88 → 4561.86] in our lives.
[4562.38 → 4563.00] This story,
[4563.12 → 4563.66] your word,
[4563.78 → 4564.30] teaches us
[4564.30 → 4565.78] that you are with us always,
[4566.16 → 4567.82] even in our suffering.
[4568.50 → 4568.74] God,
[4568.80 → 4569.74] sometimes it's easy
[4569.74 → 4570.80] to know that you are with us
[4570.80 → 4571.44] when things are good,
[4571.76 → 4572.30] but man,
[4572.36 → 4573.08] can it be hard
[4573.08 → 4574.54] to feel your presence
[4574.54 → 4575.78] or to know that you are there
[4575.78 → 4576.56] when we are suffering.
[4577.58 → 4577.92] God,
[4577.98 → 4578.56] we pray that
[4578.56 → 4580.10] in our darkest times,
[4580.56 → 4582.94] we will choose
[4582.94 → 4583.64] our suffering,
[4583.64 → 4586.18] knowing that it points us to you,
[4586.26 → 4587.04] that we will lean
[4587.04 → 4588.32] into your presence,
[4588.82 → 4589.90] the one who suffered
[4589.90 → 4591.08] greatly.
[4592.10 → 4592.58] And Lord,
[4593.38 → 4594.06] as we,
[4594.18 → 4594.68] the church,
[4594.98 → 4595.64] both suffer
[4595.64 → 4596.72] and walk alongside
[4596.72 → 4597.68] others who suffer,
[4597.82 → 4598.00] Lord,
[4598.82 → 4599.68] may we be willing
[4599.68 → 4600.62] to be present
[4600.62 → 4602.12] and be your presence
[4602.12 → 4602.76] in the midst
[4602.76 → 4604.36] of our brothers and sisters
[4604.36 → 4604.98] who are going through
[4604.98 → 4605.50] hard times.
[4605.88 → 4607.86] May we take steps of faith.
[4608.08 → 4610.12] May we be your hands
[4610.12 → 4610.56] and feet
[4610.56 → 4611.30] in this community.
[4611.84 → 4613.00] May we do no harm,
[4613.00 → 4613.96] but do good,
[4614.08 → 4615.14] not for our glory,
[4615.38 → 4616.30] but for your glory.
[4616.74 → 4617.44] And may you
[4617.44 → 4619.02] be glorified by that.
[4619.62 → 4620.08] And so, God,
[4620.14 → 4620.64] may we know
[4620.64 → 4621.76] that we are not alone today.
[4622.20 → 4622.60] May we know
[4622.60 → 4623.46] that you are present
[4623.46 → 4624.22] in our lives.
[4624.72 → 4626.26] And may we be that present
[4626.26 → 4626.80] in the lives
[4626.80 → 4627.54] of those around us.
[4627.60 → 4628.06] We pray this
[4628.06 → 4628.96] in your Son's precious
[4628.96 → 4630.30] and holy name.
[4630.72 → 4630.94] Amen.
[4633.98 → 4634.64] Please stand
[4634.64 → 4635.12] as we sing
[4635.12 → 4636.02] in response.
[4636.02 → 4636.12] Amen.
[4636.12 → 4636.22] Amen.
[4643.00 → 4656.80] I love you, Lord.
[4656.80 → 4659.82] Oh, your nurse,
[4659.88 → 4662.24] he never fails me.
[4663.24 → 4665.54] All my days
[4665.54 → 4667.08] I've been held
[4667.08 → 4669.42] in your hands.
[4669.42 → 4671.24] from the moment
[4671.24 → 4673.38] that I wake up
[4673.38 → 4677.16] until I lay my hand.
[4677.16 → 4679.38] I will sing
[4679.38 → 4681.22] of the goodness
[4681.22 → 4683.70] of God.
[4683.70 → 4685.58] of the goodness
[4685.58 → 4687.58] of God.
[4687.58 → 4688.80] And all my life
