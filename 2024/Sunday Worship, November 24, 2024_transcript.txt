[118.00 --> 120.00]  Thank you.
[120.00 --> 124.00]  Don't think you need to settle for a substitute.
[124.00 --> 128.28]  When I'm the only love that changes you
[128.28 --> 131.04]  And I am for you
[131.04 --> 135.04]  I'm not against you
[135.04 --> 138.72]  I am for you
[138.72 --> 142.62]  I'm not against you
[142.62 --> 147.88]  If you wanna know how far my love can go
[147.88 --> 151.44]  Just how deep, just how wide
[151.44 --> 155.34]  If you wanna see how much you mean to me
[155.34 --> 159.14]  Look at my hands, look at my side
[159.14 --> 164.34]  If you could count the times that say you are forgiven
[164.34 --> 168.28]  It's more than the drops in the ocean
[168.28 --> 175.00]  It's more than the drops in the ocean
[175.00 --> 179.44]  Open your heart, it's time that we start again
[181.44 --> 187.34]  Open your heart, it's time that we start again
[187.34 --> 193.24]  If you wanna know how far my love can go
[193.24 --> 196.54]  Just how deep, just how wide
[196.54 --> 200.70]  If you wanna see how much you mean to me
[200.70 --> 203.34]  Look at my hands, look at my side
[203.34 --> 209.24]  I'm not against you
[209.24 --> 213.24]  It's more than the drops in the ocean
[213.24 --> 221.24]  The drops in the ocean
[221.24 --> 229.14]  I am for you
[229.14 --> 231.14]  I am for you
[231.14 --> 233.14]  I'm not against you
[233.14 --> 236.14]  I am for you
[236.14 --> 238.14]  I am for you
[238.14 --> 241.14]  I am not against you
[241.14 --> 263.04]  You're not the only one who feels like this
[263.04 --> 266.94]  Feeling like you lose more than you win
[266.94 --> 268.94]  Like life is just an endless hill
[268.94 --> 274.94]  You climb, you try and try, but never arrive
[274.94 --> 276.84]  I am not against you
[276.84 --> 278.84]  I am telling you something
[278.84 --> 280.84]  This racing, this running
[280.84 --> 282.84]  Oh, you're working way too hard
[282.84 --> 284.84]  You're working way too hard
[284.84 --> 286.84]  And this perfection you're chasing
[286.84 --> 288.84]  Is just energy wasted
[288.84 --> 290.84]  Cause He loves you like you are
[290.84 --> 294.74]  So go ahead and live like you're loved
[294.74 --> 298.74]  It's okay to act like you've been set free
[298.74 --> 302.74]  His love has made you more than enough
[302.74 --> 306.74]  So go ahead and be who He made you to be
[306.74 --> 310.74]  And live like you're loved
[310.74 --> 314.74]  Live like you're loved
[314.74 --> 318.74]  Live like you're loved
[318.74 --> 322.74]  Live like you're loved
[322.74 --> 326.74]  And live like you know you're valuable
[326.74 --> 330.74]  Like you know the one that holds your soul
[330.74 --> 334.74]  Cause mercy has called you by your name
[334.74 --> 338.74]  Don't be afraid to live in that grace
[338.74 --> 341.74]  Oh, I'm telling you something
[341.74 --> 343.74]  This God we believe in
[343.74 --> 346.74]  Yeah, He changed everything
[346.74 --> 348.74]  No more guilt
[348.74 --> 349.74]  No more shame
[349.74 --> 351.74]  He took all that away
[351.74 --> 354.74]  Gave us a reason to sing
[354.74 --> 357.74]  So go ahead and live like you're loved
[357.74 --> 362.74]  It's okay to act like you've been set free
[362.74 --> 365.74]  His love has made you more than enough
[365.74 --> 370.74]  So go ahead and be who He made you to be
[370.74 --> 372.74]  And live like you're loved
[372.74 --> 374.74]  And live like you're loved
[374.74 --> 376.74]  Living like you're loved
[376.74 --> 378.74]  Live like you're loved
[378.74 --> 380.74]  Live like you're loved
[380.74 --> 382.74]  Live like you're loved
[382.74 --> 384.74]  Live like you're loved
[384.74 --> 386.74]  Live like you're loved
[386.74 --> 387.74]  Live like you're loved
[387.74 --> 388.74]  Watch like you're free
[388.74 --> 390.74]  Stay like you know who we made you to be
[390.74 --> 391.74]  Live like you're loved
[391.74 --> 395.36]  Stand like you know who he made you to be
[395.36 --> 399.36]  Live like you love, like you believe
[399.36 --> 403.38]  His love is all that you'll ever need
[403.38 --> 406.58]  So go ahead and live like you left
[406.58 --> 414.58]  His love has made you more than enough
[414.58 --> 422.56]  So go ahead and live like you left
[422.56 --> 427.22]  It's okay to act like you've been set free
[427.22 --> 430.90]  His love has made you more than enough
[430.90 --> 435.44]  So go ahead and be who he made you to be
[435.44 --> 437.36]  And live like you left
[437.36 --> 441.32]  Live like you left
[441.32 --> 445.32]  Live like you left
[445.32 --> 447.54]  Live like you left
[447.54 --> 449.32]  Live like you left
[449.32 --> 451.56]  Live like you left
[451.56 --> 453.44]  Live like you left
[453.44 --> 455.36]  Walk like you're free
[455.36 --> 459.36]  Stand like you know who he made you to be
[459.36 --> 461.48]  Live like you loved
[461.48 --> 463.42]  Like you believe
[463.42 --> 467.42]  His love is all that you'll ever need
[467.42 --> 469.66]  Live like you loved
[471.32 --> 473.32]  Live like you left
[473.32 --> 475.32]  Live like you left
[475.32 --> 477.32]  Live like you left
[477.32 --> 485.32]  If you left
[485.32 --> 486.28]  Live like you right
[486.28 --> 487.32]  Live like you left
[487.32 --> 488.38]  Live like you left
[488.38 --> 489.32]  Live like you left
[489.32 --> 491.32]  Once you're not
[491.32 --> 492.32]  Live like you left
[492.32 --> 494.28]  Live like you left
[494.28 --> 495.30]  Live like you right
[495.30 --> 496.32]  Live like you left
[496.32 --> 497.32]  Live like you left
[497.32 --> 498.32]  Far Primary
[498.32 --> 499.92]  Live like you left
[499.92 --> 500.32]  Live like you left
[500.32 --> 501.28]  Live like I
[501.28 --> 503.32]  Stop
[503.32 --> 504.32]  Live like
[504.32 --> 507.84]  With every option exhausted
[507.84 --> 511.96]  You tried everything you know
[511.96 --> 516.52]  You saw light then you lost it
[516.52 --> 519.60]  But there is still hope
[519.60 --> 523.52]  Like the fire in the night
[523.52 --> 527.46]  Like the ocean parted wide
[527.46 --> 531.34]  Like the grave empty inside
[531.34 --> 535.34]  You will see he still does
[535.34 --> 542.42]  Miracles, miracles, miracles, miracles
[542.42 --> 546.80]  Even if you don't see it now
[546.80 --> 548.50]  Without a doubt
[548.50 --> 551.30]  He's already moving
[551.30 --> 554.72]  There is not a pain that you hold
[554.72 --> 556.34]  He doesn't know
[556.34 --> 559.16]  And he isn't using
[559.16 --> 562.46]  With every option exhausted
[562.46 --> 566.70]  You tried everything you know
[566.70 --> 571.30]  So reach for something beyond it
[571.30 --> 574.22]  Cause he is our hope
[574.22 --> 578.14]  Like the fire in the night
[578.14 --> 582.02]  Like the ocean parted wide
[582.02 --> 585.32]  Like the grave empty inside
[585.32 --> 589.94]  You will see he still does
[589.94 --> 595.10]  Miracles, miracles, miracles
[595.10 --> 599.40]  Miracles, miracles, miracles
[599.40 --> 605.40]  Miracles, miracles, miracles, miracles
[605.40 --> 609.68]  A broken heart can be restored
[609.68 --> 613.68]  A broken soul can be reborn
[613.68 --> 617.56]  And greater things are still in store
[617.56 --> 619.56]  For us, for us
[619.56 --> 622.56]  For us, for us
[622.56 --> 624.56]  Like the fire in the night
[624.56 --> 626.56]  Like the fire in the night
[626.56 --> 629.56]  Like the ocean parted wide
[629.56 --> 633.56]  Like the grave empty inside
[633.56 --> 637.56]  You will see he still does
[637.56 --> 647.56]  Miracles, miracles, miracles
[647.56 --> 649.56]  Miracles, miracles
[649.56 --> 651.56]  He's still there
[651.56 --> 653.56]  He's still there
[653.56 --> 655.56]  Miracles, miracles
[655.56 --> 657.56]  You're the new God
[657.56 --> 663.56]  Good morning everyone
[663.56 --> 666.74]  Welcome to church
[666.74 --> 670.56]  Welcome to what invariably
[670.56 --> 672.22]  Is going to be a little bit of chaos
[672.22 --> 672.88]  This morning
[672.88 --> 674.62]  And we're going to worship
[674.62 --> 675.38]  Right through it
[675.38 --> 675.56]  Amen?
[676.92 --> 677.70]  Thank you
[677.70 --> 679.30]  Appreciate you
[679.30 --> 681.06]  My name is Chris
[681.06 --> 682.46]  I'm one of the pastors here
[682.46 --> 683.86]  And if you are a guest with us
[683.86 --> 684.28]  This morning
[684.28 --> 685.44]  We're really excited to
[685.44 --> 686.96]  Have you with us
[686.96 --> 688.32]  In our worship together
[688.32 --> 690.62]  Today's a special Sunday
[690.62 --> 691.72]  In the life of a church
[691.72 --> 694.08]  As we participate in baptisms
[694.08 --> 695.28]  And professions of faith
[695.28 --> 696.70]  And in welcoming new members
[696.70 --> 698.62]  Here in our midst
[698.62 --> 701.62]  And so today is a good day
[701.62 --> 703.32]  Before we begin in worship
[703.32 --> 705.34]  We have a few announcements to make
[705.34 --> 707.58]  And so first of all
[707.58 --> 710.80]  A reminder that this coming Friday
[710.80 --> 714.98]  Is the women's Christmas event
[714.98 --> 715.72]  And evening
[715.72 --> 717.62]  There's been sign-ups for that
[717.62 --> 718.14]  And the like
[718.14 --> 719.28]  And so that's happening
[719.28 --> 721.02]  On this coming Friday
[721.02 --> 724.00]  In addition to that
[724.00 --> 726.16]  The women's ministry group
[726.16 --> 726.88]  Has asked
[726.88 --> 728.64]  If we could help them
[728.64 --> 730.28]  Clean up the chairs
[730.28 --> 731.44]  Today
[731.44 --> 733.08]  Following our worship
[733.08 --> 734.70]  And so not necessarily
[734.70 --> 736.46]  Immediately after worship
[736.46 --> 737.18]  Because we want you
[737.18 --> 738.18]  To be able to get your coffee
[738.18 --> 739.24]  And talk to your friends
[739.24 --> 739.74]  And the like
[739.74 --> 741.84]  But sometime around there
[741.84 --> 743.26]  It would be a real help
[743.26 --> 743.92]  If you could just
[743.92 --> 745.06]  Stack a bunch of chairs
[745.06 --> 746.64]  And maybe move them to the side
[746.64 --> 747.32]  So that they can
[747.32 --> 748.36]  Throughout this week
[748.36 --> 750.22]  Set up this space
[750.22 --> 750.92]  For that event
[750.92 --> 752.68]  Additionally
[752.68 --> 754.72]  2020 is happening
[754.72 --> 756.62]  Tonight at 6.30
[756.62 --> 757.84]  And so that's a youth
[757.84 --> 759.08]  Ministry event
[759.08 --> 759.56]  And program
[759.56 --> 760.32]  If you have any questions
[760.32 --> 760.76]  On that
[760.76 --> 761.92]  You can grab Pastor Kevin
[761.92 --> 763.68]  He'll gladly give you
[763.68 --> 764.60]  The details there
[764.60 --> 767.20]  I think that's it
[767.20 --> 767.68]  For today
[767.68 --> 769.54]  Let's stand together
[769.54 --> 771.14]  And we can be ushered
[771.14 --> 771.98]  Into the presence
[771.98 --> 773.16]  Of our good God
[773.16 --> 779.28]  God welcomes us
[779.28 --> 780.38]  Into this space
[780.38 --> 782.62]  And he greets us
[782.62 --> 784.90]  In our shared worship
[784.90 --> 785.82]  As we mentioned
[785.82 --> 787.42]  Today is a special Sunday
[787.42 --> 788.40]  And part of our
[788.40 --> 789.96]  Worship selection
[789.96 --> 790.80]  Has been chosen
[790.80 --> 791.52]  By the people
[791.52 --> 792.14]  Who will be
[792.14 --> 793.32]  Doing their profession
[793.32 --> 793.76]  Of faith
[793.76 --> 794.54]  Are being welcomed
[794.54 --> 796.02]  As new members
[796.02 --> 797.08]  Here later today
[797.08 --> 797.48]  And so
[797.48 --> 798.82]  Keep your ear out
[798.82 --> 799.70]  For a new song
[799.70 --> 800.40]  In that regard
[800.40 --> 801.44]  As we join together
[801.44 --> 802.82]  In our collective worship
[802.82 --> 803.84]  In the presence
[803.84 --> 804.96]  Of God
[804.96 --> 806.22]  God's presence
[806.22 --> 807.04]  Is here among us
[807.04 --> 807.80]  And we mark that
[807.80 --> 809.06]  By receiving his greeting
[809.06 --> 810.54]  And then by extending
[810.54 --> 811.18]  That greeting
[811.18 --> 812.12]  To those around you
[812.12 --> 813.10]  So after I give you
[813.10 --> 813.64]  God's greeting
[813.64 --> 814.56]  I invite you to turn
[814.56 --> 815.66]  To the people around you
[815.66 --> 816.82]  And welcome them
[816.82 --> 817.78]  In the name of the Lord
[817.78 --> 818.78]  Say the Lord be with you
[818.78 --> 819.76]  Or the peace of Christ
[819.76 --> 820.84]  Be with you
[820.84 --> 821.50]  As we gather
[821.50 --> 822.84]  In his presence today
[822.84 --> 823.72]  Receive the greeting
[823.72 --> 824.60]  Of our good God
[824.60 --> 826.02]  Grace
[826.02 --> 827.40]  Mercy
[827.40 --> 828.90]  And peace to you
[828.90 --> 830.12]  From God our Father
[830.12 --> 831.78]  From the Lord Jesus Christ
[831.78 --> 832.98]  Son and our Savior
[832.98 --> 834.34]  Through the presence
[834.34 --> 834.86]  And power
[834.86 --> 836.04]  Of the Holy Spirit
[836.04 --> 837.36]  Amen
[857.40 --> 886.38]  Revelation 5 verse 13
[886.38 --> 889.18]  Then I heard
[889.18 --> 890.06]  Every creature
[890.06 --> 890.94]  In heaven
[890.94 --> 891.86]  And on earth
[891.86 --> 893.02]  And under the earth
[893.02 --> 894.88]  And on the sea
[894.88 --> 896.16]  And all that is in them
[896.16 --> 896.60]  Saying
[896.60 --> 897.74]  To him
[897.74 --> 898.52]  Who sits
[898.52 --> 899.28]  On the throne
[899.28 --> 900.92]  And to the Lamb
[900.92 --> 901.82]  Be praise
[901.82 --> 902.96]  And honor
[902.96 --> 903.90]  And glory
[903.90 --> 904.76]  And power
[904.76 --> 905.52]  Forever
[905.52 --> 906.82]  And ever
[906.82 --> 909.66]  If you've been forgiven
[909.66 --> 911.98]  And if you've been redeemed
[911.98 --> 913.78]  Sing the song
[913.78 --> 914.30]  Forever
[914.30 --> 915.34]  To the Lamb
[915.34 --> 916.68]  If you walk
[916.68 --> 917.24]  In freedom
[917.24 --> 918.14]  And if you
[918.14 --> 919.16]  Bear his name
[919.16 --> 920.96]  Sing forever
[920.96 --> 921.88]  The song
[921.88 --> 922.50]  To the Lamb
[922.50 --> 924.76]  Let's join our voices
[924.76 --> 925.50]  This morning
[925.50 --> 927.04]  And worship the one
[927.04 --> 928.70]  Who sits on the throne
[928.70 --> 930.08]  And the Lamb
[930.08 --> 943.70]  God

[1102.42 --> 1103.74]  Our lives
[1103.74 --> 1105.86]  Willingly our needs

[1142.18 --> 1143.18]  Come
[1143.18 --> 1152.18]  Come
[1152.18 --> 1153.18]  Come
[1153.18 --> 1154.18]  Come
[1154.18 --> 1160.18]  A thousand generations
[1160.18 --> 1174.42]  A thousand generations falling down in worship to sing the song of ages to the end.
[1176.02 --> 1188.36]  And all who long before us and all who will believe sing the song of ages to the end.
[1190.18 --> 1201.94]  Your name is the highest, your name is the greatest, your name stands above the whole.
[1201.94 --> 1214.94]  All thrones and the regions, all powers and positions, your name stands above the whole.
[1215.24 --> 1218.22]  And the angels cry.
[1218.22 --> 1224.22]  Holy, vocation rise.
[1225.36 --> 1231.56]  Holy, you are lifted high.
[1231.98 --> 1237.42]  Holy, holy forever.
[1237.42 --> 1253.42]  If you've been forgiven, if you've been redeemed, sing the song forever to the land.
[1253.42 --> 1266.56]  If you walk into freedom, and if you bear His name, sing the song forever to the land.
[1266.56 --> 1271.56]  And sing the song forever to the land.
[1271.56 --> 1274.56]  And the angels cry.
[1274.56 --> 1280.56]  Holy, vocation rise.
[1280.56 --> 1286.56]  Holy, you are lifted high.
[1286.56 --> 1292.56]  Holy, holy forever.
[1292.56 --> 1293.56]  Holy, holy forever.
[1293.56 --> 1296.56]  Holy, holy forever.
[1296.56 --> 1298.56]  Hear your people sing.
[1298.56 --> 1304.56]  Holy, holy to the King of peace.
[1304.56 --> 1310.56]  Holy, you will always be.
[1310.56 --> 1315.56]  Holy, holy forever.
[1315.56 --> 1316.56]  Holy, holy forever.
[1316.56 --> 1317.56]  Holy, holy forever.
[1317.56 --> 1322.56]  Holy, holy forever.
[1322.56 --> 1334.56]  Your name is the highest, your name is the greatest, your name stands above the whole.
[1334.56 --> 1345.56]  All thrones and dominions, all powers, their positions, your name stands above the whole.
[1345.56 --> 1346.56]  And the angels rise to the Lord.
[1346.56 --> 1347.56]  Has you signed the highest, your name from the Lord.
[1347.66 --> 1349.56]  What will you like to have that, your shelters, the holy forever?
[1350.56 --> 1353.56]  Holy, holy forever.
[1357.56 --> 1358.56]  Holy, holy forever.
[1358.56 --> 1367.56]  Holy, holy forever.
[1367.56 --> 1368.56]  Amen.
[1368.56 --> 1369.56]  Holy, holy forever.
[1369.56 --> 1371.56]  Amen.
[1371.56 --> 1373.56]  Holy, holy forever.
[1373.56 --> 1375.56]  You live in holy, Holyibanjuds.
[1375.56 --> 1389.56]  king
[1392.76 --> 1395.56]  you will always be
[1395.56 --> 1397.56]  holy
[1397.56 --> 1399.56]  holy
[1399.56 --> 1401.56]  forever
[1409.56 --> 1415.56]  Ever notice when life gets busy the easiest thing to skip is our reading of God's Word?
[1415.56 --> 1419.56]  Pastor Chris has asked us a couple weeks ago
[1419.56 --> 1425.56]  how often do we feast or nourish ourselves in God's Word in our daily lives?
[1425.56 --> 1431.56]  our heart's desire should be to walk closely with God
[1431.56 --> 1433.56]  to cherish his word
[1433.56 --> 1435.56]  but our flesh can be so weak
[1435.56 --> 1441.56]  will you pray Psalm 119 verses 10 to 16 with us
[1441.56 --> 1445.56]  that we will cherish and delight in God's Word
[1445.56 --> 1447.56]  let's pray
[1447.56 --> 1449.56]  let's pray
[1453.56 --> 1457.56]  Father I seek you with all my heart
[1457.56 --> 1459.56]  do not let me stray from your commands
[1459.56 --> 1465.56]  I've hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you
[1465.56 --> 1469.56]  praise be to you Lord teach me your decrees
[1469.56 --> 1475.56]  with my lips I recount all the laws that come from your mouth
[1475.56 --> 1481.56]  I rejoice in following your statutes as one rejoices in great riches
[1481.56 --> 1487.56]  I meditate on your precepts and consider your ways
[1487.56 --> 1491.56]  I delight in your decrees
[1491.56 --> 1493.56]  I will not neglect your word
[1493.56 --> 1501.56]  help us Father to live this prayer out by the power of your spirit
[1501.56 --> 1503.56]  amen
[1503.56 --> 1505.56]  amen
[1505.56 --> 1519.56]  frankly
[1519.56 --> 1520.56]  God.
[1524.42 --> 1526.56]  There's a place
[1527.32 --> 1528.78]  where streams
[1528.78 --> 1530.74]  of grace
[1530.74 --> 1534.56]  flow deep and wide.
[1537.54 --> 1539.56]  And all the love
[1540.38 --> 1542.56]  I've ever found
[1543.40 --> 1545.66]  comes like a
[1545.66 --> 1546.56]  flood
[1546.56 --> 1549.56]  comes flowing down.
[1554.16 --> 1555.92]  At the cross
[1555.92 --> 1556.56]  at the cross
[1557.24 --> 1558.56]  I surrender
[1558.56 --> 1560.44]  my life
[1560.44 --> 1561.60]  to Him
[1561.60 --> 1562.56]  of you.
[1563.88 --> 1564.80]  To Him
[1564.80 --> 1566.56]  of you.
[1567.06 --> 1568.70]  Where your love
[1568.70 --> 1569.56]  and death
[1569.56 --> 1571.56]  is my sweet
[1571.56 --> 1573.04]  wash my
[1573.04 --> 1575.56]  I owe all to you.
[1575.56 --> 1580.56]  For all to Jesus.
[1580.56 --> 1587.56]  There's a place
[1588.52 --> 1590.56]  where sin and shame
[1591.56 --> 1593.56]  are powerless.
[1597.56 --> 1600.56]  Where my heart
[1601.10 --> 1603.56]  has peace with God
[1603.56 --> 1604.56]  and heal the world
[1604.56 --> 1606.56]  will heal the world.
[1606.56 --> 1612.56]  Where all the love
[1612.56 --> 1615.56]  I've ever found
[1615.56 --> 1619.56]  comes like a flood
[1619.56 --> 1621.56]  flowing down.
[1621.56 --> 1622.56]  I owe all to you.
[1622.56 --> 1623.56]  I owe all to you.
[1623.56 --> 1624.56]  I owe all to you.
[1624.56 --> 1625.56]  I owe all to you.
[1626.56 --> 1627.56]  Where your love
[1627.56 --> 1629.56]  can bear
[1629.56 --> 1631.56]  and my sin
[1631.56 --> 1632.56]  are not white.
[1632.56 --> 1634.56]  I owe all to you.
[1634.56 --> 1635.56]  I owe all to you.
[1635.56 --> 1637.56]  I owe all to you.
[1637.56 --> 1638.56]  I owe all to you.
[1638.56 --> 1639.56]  I owe all to you.
[1639.56 --> 1640.56]  Where my heart
[1640.56 --> 1641.56]  is down.
[1641.56 --> 1642.56]  Here
[1642.56 --> 1645.56]  I'm holy ground.
[1645.56 --> 1647.56]  Here I'm round
[1647.56 --> 1651.24]  I don't want you
[1651.24 --> 1656.78]  I want you down here
[1656.78 --> 1659.80]  I'm going down here
[1659.80 --> 1662.88]  I'm going down here
[1662.88 --> 1665.04]  I'm going down here
[1665.04 --> 1669.04]  I'm going down here
[1669.04 --> 1671.20]  You'll save my life
[1671.20 --> 1674.56]  Here I'm down here
[1674.56 --> 1677.56]  Here I'm down here
[1677.56 --> 1679.20]  At the cross, at the cross
[1679.20 --> 1682.34]  I surrender my life
[1682.34 --> 1685.16]  I live on you
[1685.16 --> 1688.48]  I live on you
[1688.48 --> 1691.60]  When your love and breath
[1691.60 --> 1694.48]  And my skin wash white
[1694.48 --> 1697.08]  I owe all to you
[1697.08 --> 1700.12]  I owe all to you
[1700.12 --> 1703.12]  I owe all to you
[1703.12 --> 1706.12]  I owe all to you
[1706.12 --> 1708.12]  Jesus
[1708.12 --> 1713.36]  You may be seated
[1713.36 --> 1714.36]  Amen.
[1743.36 --> 1744.36]  Amen.
[1773.36 --> 1775.36]  Amen.
[1803.36 --> 1813.40]  When I think about my life, I reflect on the people.
[1813.40 --> 1817.62]  People I've met along the way and people who have been with me since the beginning.
[1817.62 --> 1822.12]  Before becoming a teacher, I worked in healthcare for 10 years and met many people from all walks
[1822.12 --> 1823.12]  of life.
[1823.12 --> 1828.14]  I've taken care of countless patients whose stories have had an impact on me.
[1828.14 --> 1832.36]  With that said, I also think about the impact that I could potentially have on others and
[1832.36 --> 1837.06]  regularly ask myself, do I embody the fruits of the Spirit?
[1837.06 --> 1839.86]  Am I quick to listen or respond?
[1839.86 --> 1842.64]  Do I have empathy before judgment?
[1842.64 --> 1847.28]  Do I embody the person that Jesus has called me to be?
[1847.28 --> 1852.16]  As I get older, I'm truly recognizing what it means for me to take his lead on my life
[1852.16 --> 1853.88]  and not my own.
[1853.88 --> 1858.78]  I will admit I am someone who likes to be in control, organized, and check things off my
[1858.78 --> 1861.00]  seamlessly endless to-do list.
[1861.00 --> 1864.24]  I am Katie's daughter.
[1864.24 --> 1869.70]  However, sometimes I will admit that I hunker down too much and I only see the path that
[1869.70 --> 1871.88]  I have laid out.
[1871.88 --> 1876.50]  As we're called to walk with Jesus and talk to him, I look forward to finally becoming
[1876.50 --> 1879.70]  an official member after over three decades.
[1879.70 --> 1884.30]  I look forward to walking and talking with all of you and taking Jesus' lead.
[1884.30 --> 1888.40]  I look forward to seeing the impact that Jesus will have on my life through you.
[1888.40 --> 1900.82]  Yeah, it's nice and short.
[1900.82 --> 1904.64]  Johanna, I'm super excited that you're up here today.
[1904.64 --> 1909.62]  When I got here, I won't say how long ago because it'll age us both, but you were in youth when
[1909.62 --> 1910.38]  I showed up here.
[1910.38 --> 1913.48]  So it was a while ago and I've known you for a long time.
[1913.48 --> 1918.92]  And this day, I feel, has been sort of a long time coming, which makes it even more special,
[1918.92 --> 1920.44]  I think, that we are up here today.
[1920.44 --> 1924.24]  And that we get to baptize your daughter, McKenna, in a moment makes it equally as special.
[1924.24 --> 1930.20]  So in that light, I wanted to read a Bible passage today that makes me think of you.
[1930.20 --> 1933.58]  It's from Ephesians 4 and it's verses 14 to 16.
[1933.58 --> 1934.20]  It says this,
[1934.20 --> 1940.00]  Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves and blown here and there
[1940.00 --> 1945.30]  by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of people in their deceitful scheming.
[1945.38 --> 1951.86]  Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become in every respect the mature body
[1951.86 --> 1954.80]  of him who is the head, that is Christ.
[1955.72 --> 1961.14]  From him, the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds
[1961.14 --> 1964.24]  itself up in love as each part does its work.
[1964.90 --> 1968.94]  So I've seen your growth over the amount of years that I've known you for here.
[1969.16 --> 1974.36]  And I know Pastor Chris has seen the same growth as he's walked alongside you and Mike here as
[1974.36 --> 1974.58]  well.
[1975.02 --> 1980.00]  Today, you are professing your commitment to both Jesus and the body of Christ.
[1980.00 --> 1985.50]  And I pray that you keep sort of pressing onwards, growing more and more into the mature body
[1985.50 --> 1987.66]  of Christ that we are all called to be.
[1988.36 --> 1993.74]  So as you do that, I hope that when you look out and see all of these wonderful people out
[1993.74 --> 1999.16]  here, you'll see that the same body of Christ that you belong to, the body of Christ that
[1999.16 --> 2003.08]  you're professing to today, that these are all people who are committed to you.
[2003.50 --> 2006.16]  They're committed to supporting you and lifting you up.
[2006.16 --> 2012.36]  And church, when you look up here at Johanna and McKenna in a moment, and then many others
[2012.36 --> 2018.72]  as well, you will see them all as members of that same body who we are called to encourage,
[2019.12 --> 2020.58]  build up, and walk alongside.
[2020.74 --> 2024.32]  We are all called to join together in our faith in him.
[2024.40 --> 2029.04]  And so Johanna, you are loved by Jesus more than you will ever know.
[2029.04 --> 2033.20]  And I pray that you are encouraged in this step that you are taking today.
[2033.76 --> 2038.86]  I also encourage you to grow closer and closer to Jesus each and every day as you continue
[2038.86 --> 2040.58]  to raise this beautiful little girl here.
[2041.18 --> 2046.34]  And as you walk, as he continues, as God continues to work in and through you as well.
[2046.90 --> 2047.78]  So congratulations.
[2048.42 --> 2050.08]  We have this little book here.
[2050.48 --> 2051.58]  It's an excellent book.
[2051.72 --> 2054.24]  And this is a gift on behalf of the church for your profession.
[2054.24 --> 2057.36]  You're not allowed to look at it yet because you still have to answer some questions.
[2058.02 --> 2059.24]  But that's for you.
[2059.50 --> 2060.20]  No, no, you can't.
[2060.32 --> 2061.42]  So anyways, congratulations.
[2061.62 --> 2062.78]  Let's give her a little clap.
[2069.54 --> 2070.52]  You're staying up here.
[2070.66 --> 2072.38]  Do you want to stand here or do you want to stand in the middle?
[2072.44 --> 2073.22]  No, this is great.
[2073.38 --> 2074.06]  On to the side.
[2074.16 --> 2074.44]  Perfect.
[2074.44 --> 2082.06]  It's always really interesting when I walk through profession of faith and to this journey
[2082.06 --> 2082.60]  with people.
[2083.56 --> 2088.16]  Because for most people who stand up here, saying that I love Jesus and I give myself to
[2088.16 --> 2089.60]  his church is not a problem.
[2090.40 --> 2093.84]  Saying it on stage in front of a few hundred people, that's the problem.
[2094.72 --> 2095.62]  Which is interesting.
[2095.84 --> 2097.20]  And that's kind of your story too.
[2097.48 --> 2098.08]  But you know what?
[2098.64 --> 2100.36]  Wasn't her little story amazing?
[2100.98 --> 2101.28]  Right?
[2101.38 --> 2102.04]  Isn't God good?
[2102.26 --> 2102.46]  See?
[2104.44 --> 2104.92]  All right.
[2105.08 --> 2106.74]  I'm doing this because I know you hate every minute of it.
[2106.74 --> 2107.20]  I really do.
[2107.20 --> 2107.44]  Yeah.
[2107.98 --> 2109.24]  So we're just going to prolong it.
[2110.46 --> 2116.38]  So as you have already given testimony, we now ask you to profess your faith in response
[2116.38 --> 2117.26]  to four questions.
[2117.68 --> 2119.28]  I'm going to ask you four questions.
[2120.00 --> 2126.14]  And if you so believe, I'm going to invite you to respond by saying, I do with God's help
[2126.14 --> 2128.46]  or I do God helping me, whichever one you choose.
[2130.08 --> 2130.32]  Okay.
[2130.42 --> 2131.52]  These four questions come.
[2131.58 --> 2132.30]  I'll ask all four.
[2132.30 --> 2139.88]  Johanna, do you believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God sent to redeem the world?
[2140.26 --> 2143.52]  Do you love and trust him as the one who saves you from your sin?
[2143.52 --> 2148.06]  And do you with repentance and joy embrace him as Lord of your life?
[2148.90 --> 2149.22]  Two.
[2149.72 --> 2153.70]  Do you believe that the Bible is the word of God revealing Christ and his redemption
[2153.70 --> 2157.68]  and that the confessions of this church faithfully reflect this revelation?
[2157.68 --> 2158.68]  Three.
[2158.68 --> 2159.24]  Three.
[2160.10 --> 2163.88]  Do you accept the gracious promises of God sealed to you in your baptism?
[2164.14 --> 2169.16]  And do you affirm your union with Christ and his church, which your baptism signifies?
[2170.12 --> 2170.90]  And four.
[2171.30 --> 2177.28]  Do you promise to do all you can with the help of the Holy Spirit to strengthen your love
[2177.28 --> 2182.94]  and commitment to Christ by sharing faithfully in the life of this church, honoring and submitting
[2182.94 --> 2183.86]  to its authority?
[2183.86 --> 2188.50]  And do you join with the people of God in doing the work of the Lord everywhere?
[2189.18 --> 2191.00]  Johanna, what is your answer?
[2191.42 --> 2192.50]  I do with God's help.
[2192.50 --> 2194.92]  I do with God's help, she says.
[2195.28 --> 2195.82]  Profess it.
[2196.36 --> 2196.78]  I do.
[2197.06 --> 2197.50]  God's help.
[2199.16 --> 2199.76]  Amen.
[2200.08 --> 2200.88]  Thank you for that.
[2202.00 --> 2207.62]  Johanna, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I now welcome you to all the privileges of full
[2207.62 --> 2208.06]  communion.
[2208.58 --> 2212.30]  I welcome you to full participation in the life of the church.
[2212.64 --> 2216.98]  I welcome you to its responsibilities, its joys, and its sufferings.
[2217.32 --> 2219.38]  Receive this blessing from God.
[2219.38 --> 2224.82]  May the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from
[2224.82 --> 2230.90]  the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, equip you with everything good
[2230.90 --> 2232.86]  for doing his will.
[2233.38 --> 2239.56]  And may he work in you what is pleasing to him through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory
[2239.56 --> 2241.18]  forever and ever.
[2241.26 --> 2242.24]  And all God's people said?
[2242.92 --> 2243.44]  Amen.
[2244.50 --> 2246.54]  I invite you to a moment of reprieve.
[2246.84 --> 2247.52]  Take your seat.
[2249.38 --> 2255.96]  As Johanna is making her way down, I'd like to also invite Josh and Rachel up to the front.
[2256.06 --> 2257.44]  I didn't see where you guys were sitting.
[2257.54 --> 2257.94]  Are you some?
[2257.98 --> 2258.82]  There you are.
[2262.82 --> 2266.12]  And for efficiency's sake, let's just stay on this side.
[2266.12 --> 2279.98]  Josh and Rachel and Elizabeth, it's our hope and our prayer that here at Emmanuel, your
[2279.98 --> 2284.94]  faith in God will be strengthened, that your love for Jesus will be grown, and that you
[2284.94 --> 2291.96]  will find, as you have already found, opportunities to serve the Lord by serving his church.
[2291.96 --> 2298.26]  As we welcome you into our church family this morning, we ask that you affirm the faith that
[2298.26 --> 2304.18]  you have professed in your baptism and in your commitment to God's mission in and through
[2304.18 --> 2309.66]  Langley Emmanuel, to our city, to our region, and through that to the world.
[2310.26 --> 2316.10]  To do so, I'm going to ask you three questions, after which I will invite you to respond with,
[2316.10 --> 2317.78]  we do with God's help.
[2318.78 --> 2324.70]  First, do you believe in Jesus as your Savior and Lord, and that in him only is hope and freedom
[2324.70 --> 2325.82]  from sin found?
[2326.78 --> 2331.28]  Second, do you believe that the Bible is the word of God, revealing his plan for redemption
[2331.28 --> 2336.34]  in Jesus Christ, and that the preaching and teaching of Langley Emmanuel reflect this truth?
[2337.06 --> 2341.64]  And then third, do you promise, with the help of the Holy Spirit, to do all that you can to
[2341.64 --> 2347.32]  strengthen your relationship to Jesus by being part of this church, by recognizing its oversight
[2347.32 --> 2353.48]  and authority, and by joining with us on mission for Jesus in this community, this city, and
[2353.48 --> 2353.84]  the world?
[2354.16 --> 2355.88]  Josh and Rachel, what is your answer?
[2356.44 --> 2357.72]  We do with God's help.
[2357.98 --> 2358.26]  Amen.
[2360.26 --> 2367.02]  Now, as they, along with Johanna, have professed their faith and have so become full partakers
[2367.02 --> 2373.38]  of our church family, we also have the unique opportunity this morning to baptize their children.
[2374.52 --> 2380.70]  And so, we have Elizabeth here, and I'm going to invite Mike and Johanna and McKenna to come
[2380.70 --> 2381.98]  up to the front.
[2382.72 --> 2387.42]  For those of you who haven't yet met Mike, Mike is on his own faith journey, and he's currently
[2387.42 --> 2390.54]  with us in our Christianity Explored class.
[2390.54 --> 2397.30]  Because he's not yet a member of our church, he won't be answering these questions, but
[2397.30 --> 2404.36]  he does stand here in full support of Johanna and with McKenna's baptism, and in the commitment
[2404.36 --> 2407.64]  to raise her in the Christian faith together.
[2408.96 --> 2415.96]  Now, in our church and in our tradition, we baptize infants not out of superstition or tradition
[2415.96 --> 2421.86]  or just because we like cute babies, although we see some pretty cute kids up here this morning.
[2422.64 --> 2429.54]  We baptize infants because they are covenant children and should therefore receive the sign
[2429.54 --> 2430.32]  of the covenant.
[2431.48 --> 2436.10]  In Genesis 15, God made a covenant with Abraham.
[2436.78 --> 2442.22]  Now, this covenant was sealed with the sign of circumcision in Genesis 17, and God promised
[2442.22 --> 2443.56]  to bless Abraham.
[2443.56 --> 2447.56]  And for Abraham, this meant two things in particular.
[2447.78 --> 2450.68]  It meant offspring, family, and it meant a land.
[2451.56 --> 2458.22]  But at the heart of the covenant was God's promise that he would be God to Abraham and
[2458.22 --> 2459.52]  to his children.
[2460.60 --> 2469.72]  And God cut a covenant into these people and into their relationship out of Israel's flesh,
[2469.90 --> 2471.64]  carving a people for himself.
[2471.64 --> 2476.68]  In the fullness of time, God sent his son, Jesus, to be our savior.
[2477.16 --> 2482.56]  And in his death on the cross, our old self is dead and buried.
[2482.70 --> 2488.02]  And in his resurrection, we rise to new life and look forward to the new creation.
[2488.02 --> 2494.68]  When we baptize in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, the triune God
[2494.68 --> 2500.70]  seals our adoption as his children and writes his name invisibly on our foreheads.
[2501.54 --> 2507.32]  You are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God.
[2507.86 --> 2512.14]  Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God.
[2512.14 --> 2518.62]  By baptism, we recognize a new identity in Jesus Christ.
[2519.66 --> 2526.40]  And so today we come to administer the sacrament of baptism to these beautiful children with
[2526.40 --> 2533.02]  the weight of church history to encourage us and the example of redemptive history to confirm
[2533.02 --> 2533.84]  our practice.
[2533.84 --> 2537.86]  We baptize in obedience to Christ's command.
[2539.02 --> 2544.74]  The sacrament that we are about to administer is a sign of the inclusion in the covenant family
[2544.74 --> 2545.96]  as circumcision was.
[2546.36 --> 2553.10]  The water that we are about to sprinkle is a sign of cleansing from sin as the sprinkled
[2553.10 --> 2555.78]  blood of bulls and goats in the Old Testament was.
[2555.78 --> 2563.56]  And we pray that McKenna and Elizabeth will take advantage of all their covenant privileges,
[2564.30 --> 2573.34]  acknowledging Jesus as her Lord all the days of her life, and that by faith she, they might
[2573.34 --> 2575.40]  make these promises their own.
[2576.54 --> 2578.76]  You guys have already answered a couple questions.
[2579.10 --> 2581.28]  I have two more particular to baptism.
[2581.28 --> 2586.40]  I will ask both of these questions and then invite you to respond as parents.
[2587.78 --> 2592.62]  Do you believe that your children, though sinful by nature, are received by God in Christ
[2592.62 --> 2595.80]  as members of his covenant and therefore ought to be baptized?
[2597.08 --> 2601.34]  And two, do you promise in reliance on the Holy Spirit and with the help of the Christian
[2601.34 --> 2607.62]  community to do all in your power to instruct McKenna and Elizabeth in the Christian faith and
[2607.62 --> 2612.14]  to lead them by your example into the life of Christian discipleship?
[2612.58 --> 2613.82]  Johanna, what is your answer?
[2615.44 --> 2615.72]  Amen.
[2616.18 --> 2617.68]  Josh and Rachel, what is your answer?
[2619.26 --> 2619.58]  Amen.
[2620.94 --> 2626.26]  Our Lord said, let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for the kingdom
[2626.26 --> 2628.02]  of God belongs to such as these.
[2628.60 --> 2633.02]  And so I'd like to take this opportunity to invite all the kids and the young at heart to
[2633.02 --> 2637.10]  come up to the front and just to gather on the floor, kind of right here, so that you can
[2637.10 --> 2639.44]  see most clearly what is happening.
[2639.90 --> 2644.06]  And I'm going to invite you guys just to shift here, and then we'll come one at a time through.
[2644.90 --> 2646.26]  Just move over a little bit there.
[2655.44 --> 2660.92]  Guys, in just a moment, we are going to baptize these two beautiful children, and we're going
[2660.92 --> 2663.62]  to take this water and pour it over their heads.
[2663.62 --> 2669.18]  And just like when you have a bath or when you have a shower, you get clean from that,
[2669.64 --> 2676.50]  this is a picture for us about how the blood of Jesus, how the grace of God, how the mercy
[2676.50 --> 2680.12]  of our Father makes us clean and new in Him.
[2682.60 --> 2686.76]  If you get wet while this happens, I don't really apologize.
[2686.76 --> 2693.24]  Just remember that this is a mark of what God does in our midst and for us.
[2696.60 --> 2707.92]  This water is poured out and offered as a sign and seal of Jesus' promise to you.
[2707.92 --> 2712.06]  Elizabeth, can we do you first?
[2722.06 --> 2729.00]  Elizabeth Rose Malawaini, I baptize you in the name of the Father, in the name of the Son,
[2729.00 --> 2731.88]  and in the name of the Holy Spirit.
[2733.18 --> 2733.58]  Amen.
[2745.58 --> 2746.18]  We'll see.
[2747.96 --> 2753.10]  McKenna Wilhelmina Hayward, I baptize you in the name of the Father,
[2753.10 --> 2758.90]  in the name of the Son, and in the name of the Holy Spirit.
[2760.66 --> 2761.18]  Amen.
[2763.40 --> 2763.80]  Amen.
[2763.80 --> 2763.98]  Amen.
[2772.66 --> 2773.28]  Beautiful.
[2773.62 --> 2774.18]  Good job.
[2776.82 --> 2781.90]  Congregation, church, family, friends of Josh and Rachel and Johanna and Mike,
[2781.90 --> 2787.56]  we have the opportunity now to offer them our promise of support and love.
[2788.34 --> 2792.76]  So I'm going to invite you to answer this question as you do,
[2792.86 --> 2796.52]  and if you are able, I'm going to invite you to stand as we ask this question,
[2796.52 --> 2799.96]  and then you'll be invited to respond as well by saying,
[2800.10 --> 2801.54]  we do with God's help.
[2803.44 --> 2809.22]  And so do you, congregation of the Lord Jesus Christ here at Langley Emanuel,
[2809.22 --> 2814.50]  do you promise to love, encourage, and support Johanna and Mike and McKenna,
[2814.88 --> 2816.70]  Josh and Rachel and Elizabeth,
[2817.16 --> 2819.60]  by welcoming them into our church family,
[2820.08 --> 2822.24]  by teaching the gospel of God's love,
[2822.32 --> 2825.04]  by being an example of Christian faith and character,
[2825.04 --> 2828.66]  and by giving the strong support of God's family in fellowship,
[2829.30 --> 2830.62]  prayer, and service?
[2830.62 --> 2831.62]  What is your answer?
[2832.28 --> 2833.96]  You are God.
[2834.52 --> 2835.00]  Amen.
[2836.00 --> 2836.72]  You may be seated.
[2838.78 --> 2841.20]  I'm going to stand just in the middle of you guys.
[2847.52 --> 2852.76]  So I offer this blessing to you, McKenna, and to you, Elizabeth.
[2854.26 --> 2857.86]  McKenna and Elizabeth, the Lord bless you and keep you.
[2857.86 --> 2862.22]  The Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[2862.78 --> 2867.40]  The Lord turn his face towards you and give you peace.
[2868.24 --> 2873.16]  In this way, the name of the Lord is written on you,
[2873.82 --> 2876.04]  and he makes you his own.
[2877.62 --> 2881.58]  Congregation, let's welcome them into our church family together.
[2886.14 --> 2887.26]  Thank you, guys.
[2887.26 --> 2890.30]  If you want to just stand in the front, off the stage there.
[2890.98 --> 2892.72]  We're going to move just to the front,
[2892.84 --> 2893.68]  and at this point,
[2894.16 --> 2897.06]  we also want to welcome into our church fellowship
[2897.06 --> 2899.34]  some others who come to us
[2899.34 --> 2901.96]  from other Christian Reformed churches.
[2902.94 --> 2904.30]  And so as I say your name,
[2904.72 --> 2906.76]  invite you to make your way up to the front
[2906.76 --> 2910.08]  and just stand in this group here along with them.
[2910.72 --> 2913.90]  First, I'm going to invite Jane Van Druten up to the front.
[2913.90 --> 2920.32]  Jane comes to us from Willoughby CRC and has been worshiping with us for about a year now.
[2921.08 --> 2924.44]  I also want to invite Faye Shonit up to the front.
[2925.44 --> 2929.22]  Faye also joins us from Willoughby and has been with us for some time
[2929.22 --> 2934.72]  and has probably fed every one of you at some point or another in her time here.
[2934.72 --> 2939.90]  I'd also like to invite Claus Tessemaker.
[2941.18 --> 2944.38]  Claus comes from Living Hope in Abbotsford
[2944.38 --> 2947.50]  and has recently moved up the hill to Sunridge Gardens.
[2948.28 --> 2950.66]  He also has the privilege of being
[2950.66 --> 2954.98]  Josiah Isaac Amara and Shanae Hogewonings' grandpa.
[2954.98 --> 2959.52]  So we're pretty excited to have you here, Claus, as well.
[2960.78 --> 2964.30]  And then I'd like to invite up the Wagonar family.
[2965.12 --> 2968.16]  I believe they're all here except for Marika, who's missing this morning.
[2968.36 --> 2973.50]  And so Aaron, Elise, and Tice, and Marika, who isn't able to be here with us.
[2973.68 --> 2976.92]  They have been worshiping with us for a couple years now.
[2977.24 --> 2980.60]  And can I say we are also finally getting you guys up front.
[2980.92 --> 2982.88]  So thanks, Aaron, for answering an email.
[2982.88 --> 2983.20]  Yep.
[2983.20 --> 2989.14]  They come to us from Sunlight Church in Linden, Washington.
[2990.46 --> 2994.16]  We are grateful that you are all here with us
[2994.16 --> 2999.02]  and we are excited to see what God will do in our midst through your presence
[2999.02 --> 3004.16]  and excited to celebrate what he has already done in our midst through your presence here.
[3004.66 --> 3010.32]  Our prayer continues to be that you will join in our shared mission and ministry as a church family
[3010.32 --> 3018.88]  by serving God in Murrayville and Langley and beyond, proclaiming his gospel and revealing his kingdom come and his kingdom coming.
[3018.88 --> 3021.12]  Thank you for being with us.
[3021.12 --> 3023.30]  Now, before you sit, we have a couple gifts from you.
[3023.48 --> 3028.50]  And so Eric and I think John are going to come up on behalf of our church elders.
[3029.62 --> 3031.96]  And they have some gifts for each of you.
[3034.42 --> 3037.22]  Part of what you will receive there is a notebook.
[3037.22 --> 3045.40]  We encourage you to use that notebook through the long and sometimes boring preaching that we offer around here week in and week out.
[3045.40 --> 3045.46]  All right.
[3046.04 --> 3048.44]  Or to doodle and distract yourself with.
[3048.44 --> 3051.28]  Thank you.
[3051.28 --> 3051.40]  termination Gus
[3051.40 --> 3081.38]  Thank you.
[3081.38 --> 3083.62]  Amen.
[3085.00 --> 3085.40]  Amen.
[3089.46 --> 3091.20]  And just three more seconds.
[3091.32 --> 3094.16]  I'm going to pray over you all together.
[3094.30 --> 3094.68]  Let's pray.
[3097.66 --> 3105.94]  Holy and good God, days like today, we see your miraculous provision for your church,
[3106.44 --> 3109.90]  and we thank you for the way that you are at work among us.
[3110.38 --> 3115.86]  We thank you for the testimonies that each person here represents, for the stories that
[3115.86 --> 3118.32]  we could hear and the stories that we will hear.
[3118.60 --> 3123.12]  We thank you, God, for the story that we will share going forward from this place.
[3123.32 --> 3130.28]  And most of all, we praise your name for the incredible ways you are weaving the great story
[3130.28 --> 3136.68]  of history's redemption through people like these, through this, your church here at Langley
[3136.68 --> 3137.18]  Emmanuel.
[3137.70 --> 3142.94]  We give you praise for your great provision, and we pray that each one here this morning
[3142.94 --> 3149.48]  would see your face just a little bit more clearly today, would know your grace and hold
[3149.48 --> 3155.40]  it just a little bit more dearly in our hearts, and that together we might sing your praises
[3155.40 --> 3161.28]  even as we gather, even as we grow, and even as we go.
[3161.80 --> 3163.68]  This we pray in the name of Jesus Christ.
[3163.76 --> 3166.00]  And all God's people together said, amen.
[3166.70 --> 3167.02]  Amen.
[3167.22 --> 3168.02]  You guys may have a seat.
[3168.10 --> 3168.44]  Thank you.
[3168.44 --> 3174.58]  I'm going to invite the worship team back up as we continue in our worship with another
[3174.58 --> 3179.68]  song that was chosen for us by these families to worship with.
[3179.74 --> 3181.30]  Let's stand as we sing together.
[3181.30 --> 3181.36]  Amen.
[3198.44 --> 3223.56]  Beautiful Lord, wonderful Savior, I know for sure.
[3223.56 --> 3236.92]  All of my days are held in your end, crafted into your perfect plan.
[3236.92 --> 3246.30]  You gently call me into your presence, guiding me by.
[3246.30 --> 3259.70]  Your only spirit, teach me, dear Lord, to live all of my life through your eyes.
[3260.62 --> 3268.34]  I'm captured by your holy calling, set me apart.
[3268.34 --> 3273.76]  I know you're drawing me to yourself.
[3273.76 --> 3280.76]  Lead me, Lord, I pray.
[3280.76 --> 3292.52]  Take me, hold me, use me, fill me.
[3292.52 --> 3299.76]  I give my life to the water's land.
[3299.76 --> 3320.76]  I give my life to the water's land.
[3320.76 --> 3330.76]  Beautiful Lord, wonderful Savior, I know for sure.
[3330.76 --> 3342.76]  All of my days are held in your hand, crafted into your perfect plan.
[3342.76 --> 3351.76]  You gently call me into your presence, guiding me by.
[3351.76 --> 3363.76]  Your holy spirit, teach me, dear Lord, to live all of my life through your eyes.
[3363.76 --> 3370.76]  I have to find your holy calling, set me apart.
[3370.76 --> 3375.76]  I know you're drawing me to yourself.
[3375.76 --> 3378.76]  Lead me, Lord, I pray.
[3378.76 --> 3385.76]  Lead me, hold me, use me, fill me.
[3385.76 --> 3390.76]  I give my life to the water's land.
[3390.76 --> 3391.76]  Use me, heal me.
[3391.76 --> 3403.76]  I give my life to the water's land.
[3403.76 --> 3410.76]  I give my life to the water's land.
[3410.76 --> 3424.76]  I give my life to the water's land.
[3424.76 --> 3425.76]  You are free.
[3425.76 --> 3430.76]  And I give my life to the water's land.
[3430.76 --> 3439.76]  I give my life to the water.
[3439.76 --> 3443.76]  I give my life to the water's land.
[3443.76 --> 3456.54]  Good morning, everyone.
[3456.98 --> 3460.12]  Wow, it's so good to see so many people here today.
[3460.62 --> 3463.00]  And the volume of music is wonderful.
[3463.24 --> 3465.04]  It's great to hear so many people sing.
[3465.70 --> 3469.82]  My name is Allison, and I'm one of the deacons here at Emanuel.
[3469.82 --> 3473.96]  And I'm introducing the offering today.
[3475.08 --> 3480.74]  First of all, we are going to be supporting Wagner Hills this week.
[3481.30 --> 3486.38]  Wagner Hills is a two-campus organization that is founded in Christ,
[3486.70 --> 3497.44]  and they help counsel, train, and give work to those who are recovering from addictions of all kinds,
[3497.44 --> 3498.72]  both men and women.
[3498.72 --> 3502.24]  And it's right here in our own backyard in the valley.
[3503.16 --> 3504.48]  So that's the first thing.
[3504.74 --> 3507.60]  The second is our own benevolence fund.
[3508.28 --> 3511.22]  Now, coming up to Christmas, it gets very busy.
[3511.40 --> 3513.98]  There's a lot of need out there in our community.
[3514.60 --> 3520.28]  We are currently running about 18% behind in our budget to date.
[3520.28 --> 3528.16]  It would be a huge blessing through you if we could exceed our budget and commitments for the year.
[3528.72 --> 3534.00]  Over the next month, we need to collect over $100,000 to make that happen.
[3534.20 --> 3535.62]  That seems like a huge amount.
[3535.76 --> 3539.94]  But to God, when he speaks to our hearts, that can happen.
[3539.94 --> 3549.24]  Please consider how you can give in support of all the ministries that we are involved with here at Langley Manual.
[3549.70 --> 3550.38]  Thank you.
[3550.38 --> 3580.36]  Thank you.
[3580.38 --> 3595.70]  Cait
[3595.70 --> 3599.46]  Your beautiful
[3599.46 --> 3610.70]  Your face is all I see
[3610.70 --> 3620.10]  And when your eyes are open
[3620.10 --> 3631.24]  Your grace shall bow to me
[3631.24 --> 3641.48]  Oh Lord, please light the light
[3641.48 --> 3649.52]  That haunt her right and big
[3649.52 --> 3660.66]  Replace the land of my first love
[3660.66 --> 3668.66]  And births with only faith
[3668.66 --> 3675.16]  I want to take your word
[3675.16 --> 3679.20]  And shine it all around
[3679.20 --> 3686.80]  First help me just to live it all
[3686.80 --> 3693.30]  And when I'm doing well
[3693.30 --> 3697.94]  Help me to never see the crown
[3697.94 --> 3701.94]  For my reward is giving
[3701.94 --> 3708.44]  For my reward is living for me
[3708.44 --> 3716.08]  Oh Lord, your beautiful
[3716.08 --> 3726.58]  Your face is all I see
[3726.58 --> 3739.22]  And when your eyes are on this child
[3739.22 --> 3747.72]  Your grace abounds to me
[3747.72 --> 3766.98]  I'd like to invite any kids that are here today
[3766.98 --> 3770.12]  If you're age three all the way up to grade four
[3770.12 --> 3773.08]  We have our children's worship time program
[3773.08 --> 3776.94]  That will continue our worship out in our preschool room
[3776.94 --> 3779.82]  And with the older kids together
[3779.82 --> 3781.10]  So if you're visiting with us
[3781.10 --> 3784.08]  We would love to have you join us for children's worship time
[3784.08 --> 3787.80]  You can come up now or just follow us when we leave
[3787.80 --> 3789.70]  And we will help you get to where you need to go
[3789.70 --> 3793.52]  We're going to just keep it short up here today
[3793.52 --> 3795.26]  I'm going to save all my questions for you
[3795.26 --> 3796.58]  When we get into the room
[3796.58 --> 3799.38]  So I'm just going to invite you to stand
[3799.38 --> 3800.94]  And we'll do the blessing right away
[3800.94 --> 3802.62]  And then we're going to head off right away
[3802.62 --> 3803.42]  To children's worship
[3803.42 --> 3812.62]  The Lord be with you
[3812.62 --> 3814.62]  And also with you
[3823.52 --> 3841.96]  Good morning everyone
[3841.96 --> 3843.46]  Steve and Elder here
[3843.46 --> 3845.48]  And before I leave this
[3845.48 --> 3847.46]  Family prayer this morning
[3847.46 --> 3849.78]  Just a reminder that next week
[3849.78 --> 3852.40]  Sunday evening at 5pm
[3852.40 --> 3854.42]  We'll have the Try Soup Tournament
[3854.42 --> 3856.44]  Where you make your best soup
[3856.44 --> 3857.68]  And everyone tries it
[3857.68 --> 3858.86]  And we have a little secret ballot
[3858.86 --> 3860.22]  And pick a winner
[3860.22 --> 3862.52]  And following that at 6pm
[3862.52 --> 3864.58]  We'll have our fall AGM
[3864.58 --> 3867.80]  To approve the 2025 budget
[3867.80 --> 3869.36]  And hear ministry updates
[3869.36 --> 3871.70]  From a couple ministries and missionaries
[3871.70 --> 3873.30]  So great to see everyone out there
[3873.30 --> 3876.08]  Let us pray
[3876.08 --> 3879.28]  Heavenly Father
[3879.28 --> 3882.20]  We come before you again this Sunday morning
[3882.20 --> 3883.72]  As a group of believers
[3883.72 --> 3884.82]  United in you
[3884.82 --> 3886.20]  A group of people
[3886.20 --> 3888.02]  With a wide variety of emotions
[3888.02 --> 3888.90]  And feelings
[3888.90 --> 3890.90]  Some of us come with joy
[3890.90 --> 3892.66]  With reasons to be thankful
[3892.66 --> 3895.84]  Some of us with a deep sense of contentment
[3895.84 --> 3898.02]  Others have concerns and worries
[3898.02 --> 3899.44]  Are sad and weary
[3899.44 --> 3900.64]  Are burdened
[3900.64 --> 3901.60]  And are frustrated
[3901.60 --> 3903.34]  We are your people
[3903.34 --> 3904.82]  And we know that in the end
[3904.82 --> 3905.72]  We need to trust
[3905.72 --> 3907.58]  That you will make all things right
[3907.58 --> 3909.14]  But Lord
[3909.14 --> 3909.84]  We are also
[3909.84 --> 3910.92]  A fallen people
[3910.92 --> 3911.62]  Who live in
[3911.62 --> 3913.40]  And are influenced
[3913.40 --> 3914.70]  By the world around us
[3914.70 --> 3915.96]  We live in a world
[3915.96 --> 3916.92]  That bombards us
[3916.92 --> 3917.96]  With many messages
[3917.96 --> 3919.18]  We are told
[3919.18 --> 3920.16]  To put our head down
[3920.16 --> 3921.20]  And keep on working
[3921.20 --> 3922.06]  And that
[3922.06 --> 3923.38]  If we try hard enough
[3923.38 --> 3924.58]  It will be all well
[3924.58 --> 3925.76]  And to never give up
[3925.76 --> 3926.50]  To keep fighting
[3926.50 --> 3927.26]  To strive
[3927.26 --> 3928.22]  To attain our goals
[3928.22 --> 3929.70]  Eternal God
[3929.70 --> 3930.68]  Remind us
[3930.68 --> 3931.60]  Again this morning
[3931.60 --> 3932.84]  That the work
[3932.84 --> 3934.02]  Has already been done
[3934.02 --> 3934.64]  On the cross
[3934.64 --> 3936.28]  That you have already
[3936.28 --> 3937.42]  Paid the price for us
[3937.42 --> 3939.60]  And that rather than striving
[3939.60 --> 3940.82]  You call us to a life
[3940.82 --> 3941.86]  Of submittal obedience
[3941.86 --> 3942.60]  And trust
[3942.60 --> 3944.20]  Help us to let go
[3944.20 --> 3945.30]  Of our many gods
[3945.30 --> 3946.90]  We worship in our lives
[3946.90 --> 3948.10]  And to hear your call
[3948.10 --> 3951.64]  We have grateful hearts
[3951.64 --> 3952.14]  This morning
[3952.14 --> 3952.80]  Thanking you
[3952.80 --> 3953.30]  For the gift
[3953.30 --> 3954.00]  Of new members
[3954.00 --> 3954.82]  Baptisms
[3954.82 --> 3956.02]  And professions of faith
[3956.02 --> 3957.04]  We rejoice
[3957.04 --> 3957.74]  In the talents
[3957.74 --> 3958.28]  And service
[3958.28 --> 3959.36]  Each of these individuals
[3959.36 --> 3960.26]  Brings your kingdom
[3960.26 --> 3961.66]  Enriching our congregation
[3961.66 --> 3963.24]  We ask for
[3963.24 --> 3964.74]  Guidance and support
[3964.74 --> 3966.10]  Of each of these new members
[3966.10 --> 3967.42]  As they find their place
[3967.42 --> 3967.96]  Among us
[3967.96 --> 3969.06]  May they feel welcomed
[3969.06 --> 3969.68]  And valued
[3969.68 --> 3970.70]  As part of this family
[3970.70 --> 3973.74]  We give you thanks
[3973.74 --> 3976.08]  That in even times of trouble
[3976.08 --> 3977.20]  We may turn to you
[3977.20 --> 3977.98]  That
[3977.98 --> 3980.78]  That into your strong arms
[3980.78 --> 3982.28]  We may offload our sins
[3982.28 --> 3982.94]  Our weariness
[3982.94 --> 3983.56]  And our pain
[3983.56 --> 3984.54]  And our grief
[3984.54 --> 3986.30]  We pray for all those
[3986.30 --> 3986.90]  Who are struggling
[3986.90 --> 3988.18]  With a heavy burden today
[3988.18 --> 3990.06]  Including those that are grieving
[3990.06 --> 3991.22]  Lonely
[3991.22 --> 3992.38]  Anxious
[3992.38 --> 3994.06]  Dealing with addiction
[3994.06 --> 3995.82]  Struggling with their mental
[3995.82 --> 3996.76]  And physical health
[3996.76 --> 3998.98]  For those that are awaiting tests
[3998.98 --> 4000.06]  Results of surgeries
[4000.06 --> 4001.24]  Undergoing treatments
[4001.24 --> 4002.28]  In pain
[4002.28 --> 4002.98]  And recovering
[4002.98 --> 4004.62]  Or dealing with long term
[4004.62 --> 4005.88]  Health issues
[4005.88 --> 4008.08]  Specifically this week
[4008.08 --> 4009.38]  We pray for Linda Rook
[4009.38 --> 4010.06]  Who was diagnosed
[4010.06 --> 4011.00]  With breast cancer
[4011.00 --> 4012.22]  And has had surgery
[4012.22 --> 4013.14]  We are thankful
[4013.14 --> 4014.20]  The surgery went well
[4014.20 --> 4015.48]  And we pray that Linda
[4015.48 --> 4017.02]  Will receive complete healing
[4017.02 --> 4018.16]  And for peace
[4018.16 --> 4019.76]  In Linda and Neil's hearts
[4019.76 --> 4020.38]  As they navigate
[4020.38 --> 4021.18]  Through the treatment
[4021.18 --> 4023.52]  We pray for the family
[4023.52 --> 4024.26]  Of Ernst de Vries

[4043.92 --> 4044.98]  That need to be made
[4044.98 --> 4046.94]  And we pray for Ashley
[4046.94 --> 4048.46]  And her family

[4060.50 --> 4061.50]  To share his gifts
[4061.50 --> 4062.46]  Talents and insights
[4062.46 --> 4063.24]  Here with us
[4063.24 --> 4064.10]  And Emmanuel
[4064.10 --> 4065.28]  We ask you to bless him
[4065.28 --> 4066.46]  And his message this morning
[4066.46 --> 4067.98]  We pray this all
[4067.98 --> 4069.52]  In the name of Jesus Christ
[4069.52 --> 4070.30]  Your son
[4070.30 --> 4071.22]  Our Lord
[4071.22 --> 4072.04]  And savior
[4072.04 --> 4072.66]  Amen
[4072.66 --> 4095.80]  Here at Emmanuel
[4095.80 --> 4096.52]  We have been
[4096.52 --> 4098.18]  Looking at the story
[4098.18 --> 4098.78]  Of Joseph
[4098.78 --> 4100.46]  And we're going to
[4100.46 --> 4102.50]  Finish that story
[4102.50 --> 4103.68]  This morning
[4103.68 --> 4104.92]  And so
[4104.92 --> 4106.74]  Our like text
[4106.74 --> 4107.68]  Of focus
[4107.68 --> 4108.48]  Is going to be
[4108.48 --> 4109.88]  From Genesis 50
[4109.88 --> 4111.50]  Starting at verse 15
[4111.50 --> 4113.86]  That will be on the screen
[4113.86 --> 4115.12]  Behind me when I read it
[4115.12 --> 4115.72]  But I'm not going to
[4115.72 --> 4117.12]  Read it at the beginning
[4117.12 --> 4118.02]  We're going to jump
[4118.02 --> 4119.52]  Into the story
[4119.52 --> 4122.04]  Sort of in the middle there
[4122.04 --> 4124.26]  And get to the text
[4124.26 --> 4126.12]  As we culminate
[4126.12 --> 4127.70]  Our story together
[4127.70 --> 4129.36]  I do want to say
[4129.36 --> 4130.76]  That this morning
[4130.76 --> 4132.24]  We are going to be
[4132.24 --> 4133.32]  Looking at
[4133.32 --> 4135.42]  The role and place
[4135.42 --> 4136.38]  Of forgiveness
[4136.38 --> 4138.02]  In the life
[4138.02 --> 4140.50]  Of the Christian believer
[4140.50 --> 4143.26]  Now if you've been
[4143.26 --> 4144.80]  Around a church
[4144.80 --> 4145.48]  Or really
[4145.48 --> 4146.66]  Around any Christian
[4146.66 --> 4147.98]  For hopefully
[4147.98 --> 4149.32]  Any duration of time
[4149.32 --> 4150.46]  But if only
[4150.46 --> 4151.54]  For a little bit of time
[4151.54 --> 4154.50]  The idea of forgiveness
[4154.50 --> 4155.92]  And being forgiven
[4155.92 --> 4157.44]  Is foundational
[4157.44 --> 4158.50]  Is central
[4158.50 --> 4160.50]  To who we are
[4160.50 --> 4161.72]  As Christians
[4161.72 --> 4163.62]  But this morning
[4163.62 --> 4164.46]  Before we get in
[4164.46 --> 4165.36]  I'm also mindful
[4165.36 --> 4166.06]  Of the fact
[4166.06 --> 4167.20]  As C.S. Lewis
[4167.20 --> 4168.14]  Put it
[4168.14 --> 4169.50]  Everyone says
[4169.50 --> 4171.22]  Forgiveness is a lovely idea
[4171.22 --> 4172.96]  Until they have something
[4172.96 --> 4173.52]  To forgive
[4173.52 --> 4175.60]  And so
[4175.60 --> 4176.62]  As we engage
[4176.62 --> 4178.02]  This morning
[4178.02 --> 4179.82]  And think through
[4179.82 --> 4181.56]  Our need for forgiveness
[4181.56 --> 4182.84]  And our need
[4182.84 --> 4183.56]  To forgive
[4183.56 --> 4184.92]  I'm mindful
[4184.92 --> 4185.86]  Of the fact
[4185.86 --> 4186.58]  That some things
[4186.58 --> 4187.92]  Might get stirred
[4187.92 --> 4188.84]  This morning
[4188.84 --> 4189.24]  And so
[4189.24 --> 4189.96]  If that's true
[4189.96 --> 4191.16]  I want to make myself
[4191.16 --> 4191.62]  Available
[4191.62 --> 4193.40]  Following our worship
[4193.40 --> 4194.56]  I'll be at the
[4194.56 --> 4195.20]  Connect booth
[4195.20 --> 4196.10]  I'm also mindful
[4196.10 --> 4197.18]  That there will be
[4197.18 --> 4197.90]  Someone up here
[4197.90 --> 4199.16]  With a yellow name tag on
[4199.16 --> 4200.10]  That would love to meet you
[4200.10 --> 4201.14]  And pray with you
[4201.14 --> 4203.18]  And process these things
[4203.18 --> 4204.16]  With you
[4204.16 --> 4206.34]  And so
[4206.34 --> 4206.76]  With that
[4206.76 --> 4208.18]  Preamble
[4208.18 --> 4208.96]  Let's
[4208.96 --> 4210.76]  Remind ourselves
[4210.76 --> 4212.60]  The story of Joseph
[4212.60 --> 4213.60]  That we have been
[4213.60 --> 4215.22]  Living in the midst of
[4215.22 --> 4216.20]  And so
[4216.20 --> 4216.64]  Joseph
[4216.64 --> 4218.36]  Was the
[4218.36 --> 4219.64]  Eleventh of
[4219.64 --> 4220.74]  Twelve sons
[4220.74 --> 4221.76]  To a man
[4221.76 --> 4223.12]  Named Jacob
[4223.12 --> 4224.44]  Joseph
[4224.44 --> 4225.44]  Is the oldest
[4225.44 --> 4226.12]  Child
[4226.12 --> 4227.52]  Of Jacob's
[4227.52 --> 4228.72]  Favorite wife
[4228.72 --> 4229.70]  Rachel
[4229.70 --> 4232.08]  Rachel has already
[4232.08 --> 4233.30]  Died by the time
[4233.30 --> 4234.42]  The Joseph story
[4234.42 --> 4235.48]  As we have it here
[4235.48 --> 4236.46]  Really begins
[4236.46 --> 4238.02]  And Joseph
[4238.02 --> 4239.48]  Is the obvious
[4239.48 --> 4240.22]  Favorite
[4240.22 --> 4241.68]  To his father
[4241.68 --> 4242.78]  And Jacob
[4242.78 --> 4243.98]  Doesn't hide that
[4243.98 --> 4244.86]  From the rest
[4244.86 --> 4245.44]  Of the family
[4245.44 --> 4247.54]  You might know
[4247.54 --> 4248.68]  The story a little bit
[4248.68 --> 4249.44]  And know that
[4249.44 --> 4250.38]  Jacob
[4250.38 --> 4251.98]  Makes for Joseph
[4251.98 --> 4253.14]  A beautiful
[4253.14 --> 4254.66]  And ornate
[4254.66 --> 4255.24]  Robe
[4255.24 --> 4256.76]  Sometimes called
[4256.76 --> 4257.48]  A technicolor
[4257.48 --> 4258.04]  Dreamcoat
[4258.04 --> 4260.46]  And the narrator
[4260.46 --> 4261.38]  Of the story
[4261.38 --> 4262.50]  Tells us that
[4262.50 --> 4264.72]  When his brothers
[4264.72 --> 4265.96]  Saw that their father
[4265.96 --> 4267.02]  Loved him more
[4267.02 --> 4268.04]  Than any of them
[4268.04 --> 4269.32]  They hated him
[4269.32 --> 4270.88]  And could not speak
[4270.88 --> 4271.76]  A kind word
[4271.76 --> 4272.18]  To him
[4272.18 --> 4274.34]  Now as the story
[4274.34 --> 4274.84]  Rolls
[4274.84 --> 4275.64]  Joseph has
[4275.64 --> 4277.14]  These two dreams
[4277.14 --> 4277.90]  That tell
[4277.90 --> 4279.20]  How his father
[4279.20 --> 4280.08]  And brothers
[4280.08 --> 4281.30]  And their families
[4281.30 --> 4282.36]  Will bow down
[4282.36 --> 4282.78]  To him
[4282.78 --> 4284.94]  Now perhaps
[4284.94 --> 4285.88]  Understandably
[4285.88 --> 4287.02]  His brothers
[4287.02 --> 4287.88]  Are jealous
[4287.88 --> 4289.08]  And they're hurt
[4289.08 --> 4290.78]  By his father's
[4290.78 --> 4291.66]  Obvious
[4291.66 --> 4292.64]  Favoritism
[4292.64 --> 4295.52]  And to be candid
[4295.52 --> 4296.32]  Joseph's
[4296.32 --> 4297.88]  Apparent narcissism
[4297.88 --> 4298.58]  Probably didn't
[4298.58 --> 4299.34]  Help the situation
[4299.34 --> 4299.62]  Either
[4299.62 --> 4302.06]  Now while his brothers
[4302.06 --> 4302.84]  Are out taking
[4302.84 --> 4304.08]  Care of flocks
[4304.08 --> 4305.68]  Jacob tells Joseph
[4305.68 --> 4306.28]  To go
[4306.28 --> 4307.44]  And to find out
[4307.44 --> 4308.44]  How they're doing
[4308.44 --> 4309.84]  Right
[4309.84 --> 4310.30]  To find out
[4310.30 --> 4311.00]  How it's going
[4311.00 --> 4311.98]  Now Joseph
[4311.98 --> 4312.68]  Eventually
[4312.68 --> 4313.68]  Finds them
[4313.68 --> 4314.84]  In an isolated
[4314.84 --> 4315.62]  And distant
[4315.62 --> 4316.24]  Location
[4316.24 --> 4317.02]  Called Dothan
[4317.02 --> 4318.40]  And while he is
[4318.40 --> 4319.52]  Still a ways off
[4319.52 --> 4320.06]  His brothers
[4320.06 --> 4320.64]  See him
[4320.64 --> 4321.26]  And they make
[4321.26 --> 4321.76]  A plot
[4321.76 --> 4322.56]  To kill him
[4322.56 --> 4324.40]  They seize him
[4324.40 --> 4325.36]  And throw him
[4325.36 --> 4326.02]  Into a hole
[4326.02 --> 4326.74]  In the ground
[4326.74 --> 4327.60]  Which is an empty
[4327.60 --> 4328.72]  Cistern
[4328.72 --> 4329.82]  And instead
[4329.82 --> 4331.02]  Of kill him
[4331.02 --> 4332.10]  They decide
[4332.10 --> 4333.16]  To sell him
[4333.16 --> 4334.00]  To a group
[4334.00 --> 4334.62]  Of traders
[4334.62 --> 4336.04]  Who have
[4336.04 --> 4336.70]  Meanwhile
[4336.70 --> 4337.60]  Been traveling
[4337.60 --> 4339.02]  Towards Egypt
[4339.02 --> 4340.88]  The brothers
[4340.88 --> 4341.78]  Take Joseph's
[4341.78 --> 4342.78]  Beautiful robe
[4342.78 --> 4343.60]  They cover it
[4343.60 --> 4344.50]  In dirt and blood
[4344.50 --> 4345.16]  And they bring it
[4345.16 --> 4346.00]  Back to their father
[4346.00 --> 4346.60]  And they say
[4346.60 --> 4347.30]  Look your son
[4347.30 --> 4347.98]  Has been killed
[4347.98 --> 4350.46]  Now Joseph
[4350.46 --> 4350.98]  Is carried
[4350.98 --> 4351.66]  Into Egypt
[4351.66 --> 4352.28]  By these
[4352.28 --> 4352.80]  Traders
[4352.80 --> 4353.36]  And he's
[4353.36 --> 4354.14]  Made a slave
[4354.14 --> 4354.92]  In the house
[4354.92 --> 4355.72]  Of Potiphar
[4355.72 --> 4358.08]  Even though
[4358.08 --> 4359.90]  Everything he did
[4359.90 --> 4360.70]  There while in the
[4360.70 --> 4361.42]  House of Potiphar
[4361.42 --> 4362.18]  Prospered
[4362.18 --> 4363.56]  He eventually
[4363.56 --> 4365.16]  Is falsely accused
[4365.16 --> 4366.38]  By Potiphar's wife
[4366.38 --> 4366.78]  Who had
[4366.78 --> 4368.38]  Particular designs
[4368.38 --> 4368.98]  For him
[4368.98 --> 4369.92]  And he was
[4369.92 --> 4370.88]  Thrown into
[4370.88 --> 4371.86]  An Egyptian
[4371.86 --> 4372.84]  Slave prison
[4372.84 --> 4375.10]  And then Joseph
[4375.10 --> 4375.68]  Spence
[4375.68 --> 4376.94]  Spends years
[4376.94 --> 4377.90]  In this
[4377.90 --> 4378.64]  Prison
[4378.64 --> 4381.08]  While in prison
[4381.08 --> 4382.04]  He interprets
[4382.04 --> 4382.82]  Dreams for
[4382.82 --> 4383.60]  The chief
[4383.60 --> 4384.24]  Cup baker
[4384.24 --> 4385.06]  Of the court
[4385.06 --> 4385.72]  Or the chief
[4385.72 --> 4386.56]  Baker and the
[4386.56 --> 4387.44]  Chief cup bearer
[4387.44 --> 4388.18]  Of the court
[4388.18 --> 4388.74]  To Pharaoh
[4388.74 --> 4389.70]  Both of whom
[4389.70 --> 4390.52]  Had been imprisoned
[4390.52 --> 4392.46]  The cup bearer
[4392.46 --> 4393.14]  Is eventually
[4393.14 --> 4394.50]  Restored to Pharaoh
[4394.50 --> 4395.42]  And goes back
[4395.42 --> 4395.96]  To work
[4395.96 --> 4396.86]  With him
[4396.86 --> 4398.48]  And about
[4398.48 --> 4399.16]  Two years
[4399.16 --> 4399.68]  Later
[4399.68 --> 4401.26]  Pharaoh has
[4401.26 --> 4402.32]  Some dreams
[4402.32 --> 4403.14]  That none of
[4403.14 --> 4404.10]  His magicians
[4404.10 --> 4405.20]  Or court officials
[4405.20 --> 4406.28]  Are able to
[4406.28 --> 4407.60]  Interpret
[4407.60 --> 4408.34]  Or tell him
[4408.34 --> 4409.08]  What they mean
[4409.08 --> 4410.22]  And the cup bearer
[4410.22 --> 4411.22]  Remembers
[4411.22 --> 4412.62]  This slave
[4412.62 --> 4413.20]  Joseph
[4413.20 --> 4414.26]  Who interpreted
[4414.26 --> 4415.44]  Dreams for him
[4415.44 --> 4416.40]  When he was
[4416.40 --> 4417.22]  In prison as well
[4417.22 --> 4418.78]  And so Joseph
[4418.78 --> 4419.84]  Going to Pharaoh
[4419.84 --> 4420.62]  And by God
[4420.62 --> 4421.66]  Revealing it to him
[4421.66 --> 4422.62]  Tells Pharaoh
[4422.62 --> 4423.20]  The meaning
[4423.20 --> 4424.48]  Of these two dreams
[4424.48 --> 4426.00]  He tells him
[4426.00 --> 4426.46]  That there would be
[4426.46 --> 4427.80]  Seven years of bounty
[4427.80 --> 4428.48]  Followed by
[4428.48 --> 4429.50]  Seven years of famine
[4429.50 --> 4431.74]  Joseph has a plan
[4431.74 --> 4432.74]  In light of this
[4432.74 --> 4433.84]  To prepare Egypt
[4433.84 --> 4435.10]  And to make her
[4435.10 --> 4436.18]  A source of food
[4436.18 --> 4436.92]  And of trade
[4436.92 --> 4437.86]  And of prosperity
[4437.86 --> 4439.06]  For the neighboring
[4439.06 --> 4439.88]  People
[4439.88 --> 4441.90]  During that seven years
[4441.90 --> 4442.72]  Of famine
[4442.72 --> 4443.64]  And what that means
[4443.64 --> 4444.26]  For Egypt
[4444.26 --> 4445.96]  Is that it hugely
[4445.96 --> 4447.08]  Prospers
[4447.08 --> 4448.10]  During this time
[4448.10 --> 4449.84]  Now Pharaoh
[4449.84 --> 4450.60]  Puts Joseph
[4450.60 --> 4451.32]  In charge
[4451.32 --> 4452.14]  Second only
[4452.14 --> 4452.78]  To himself
[4452.78 --> 4454.24]  And Joseph's plan
[4454.24 --> 4455.38]  Goes into effect
[4455.38 --> 4456.30]  And as Egypt
[4456.30 --> 4456.86]  Prospers
[4456.86 --> 4457.56]  So too
[4457.56 --> 4458.28]  Joseph
[4458.28 --> 4458.98]  Prospers
[4458.98 --> 4460.06]  He marries
[4460.06 --> 4460.52]  He has
[4460.52 --> 4461.56]  Two children
[4461.56 --> 4463.50]  And then eventually
[4463.50 --> 4465.80]  Ten tired
[4465.80 --> 4466.76]  Dusty
[4466.76 --> 4467.80]  Hebrew men
[4467.80 --> 4468.44]  Appear
[4468.44 --> 4469.96]  At Joseph's door
[4469.96 --> 4471.40]  Begging to buy grain
[4471.40 --> 4472.02]  To keep
[4472.02 --> 4473.04]  Their families
[4473.04 --> 4473.72]  Alive
[4473.72 --> 4476.00]  Now the brothers
[4476.00 --> 4477.36]  Don't recognize
[4477.36 --> 4478.12]  Joseph
[4478.12 --> 4479.02]  Right
[4479.02 --> 4479.56]  A generation
[4479.56 --> 4480.30]  Has passed
[4480.30 --> 4481.96]  And he appears
[4481.96 --> 4482.54]  Before them
[4482.54 --> 4483.68]  As Egyptian royalty
[4483.68 --> 4485.48]  But Joseph
[4485.48 --> 4486.60]  Recognizes
[4486.60 --> 4487.42]  His brothers
[4487.42 --> 4489.14]  And in part
[4489.14 --> 4489.98]  Of the exchange
[4489.98 --> 4490.90]  That they have
[4490.90 --> 4491.82]  And is back and forth
[4491.82 --> 4492.78]  We read that
[4492.78 --> 4493.60]  Joseph had to
[4493.60 --> 4494.70]  Hide his face
[4494.70 --> 4495.68]  A number of times
[4495.68 --> 4496.68]  Leave from them
[4496.68 --> 4497.64]  For his weeping
[4497.64 --> 4499.80]  And over the course
[4499.80 --> 4501.08]  Of several meetings
[4501.08 --> 4501.62]  And a trip
[4501.62 --> 4502.82]  Back to Jacob
[4502.82 --> 4504.42]  To collect Benjamin
[4504.42 --> 4505.76]  Who is the youngest brother
[4505.76 --> 4507.28]  Born also to Rachel
[4507.28 --> 4508.12]  Joseph's mom
[4508.12 --> 4510.40]  Probably the next favorite
[4510.40 --> 4511.16]  To Jacob
[4511.16 --> 4512.82]  And they are encouraged
[4512.82 --> 4513.86]  Required to bring
[4513.86 --> 4515.28]  Benjamin back to Egypt
[4515.28 --> 4516.56]  And during all of this
[4516.56 --> 4517.94]  Joseph is testing
[4517.94 --> 4519.56]  His brothers
[4519.56 --> 4522.42]  And as the story goes
[4522.42 --> 4523.14]  And I realize
[4523.14 --> 4524.08]  We are rushing
[4524.08 --> 4524.88]  Through a little bit
[4524.88 --> 4525.86]  As the story goes
[4525.86 --> 4526.54]  His brothers
[4526.54 --> 4527.42]  Have a choice
[4527.42 --> 4527.94]  To make
[4527.94 --> 4530.36]  Will they leave
[4530.36 --> 4531.58]  Benjamin behind
[4531.58 --> 4532.56]  In prison
[4532.56 --> 4535.20]  Effectively selling him
[4535.20 --> 4536.42]  For their own hides
[4536.42 --> 4538.50]  Essentially doing
[4538.50 --> 4539.22]  To Benjamin
[4539.22 --> 4539.94]  What they did
[4539.94 --> 4540.50]  To Joseph
[4540.50 --> 4541.42]  A lifetime ago
[4541.42 --> 4542.76]  Or
[4542.76 --> 4543.82]  Would they do
[4543.82 --> 4544.72]  Something different
[4544.72 --> 4545.54]  This time
[4545.54 --> 4548.12]  Now when they first
[4548.12 --> 4549.02]  Sold Joseph
[4549.02 --> 4550.22]  To the slave traders
[4550.22 --> 4550.86]  At the beginning
[4550.86 --> 4551.48]  Of the story
[4551.48 --> 4553.48]  It was Judah
[4553.48 --> 4554.40]  Who said
[4554.40 --> 4556.04]  What will we gain
[4556.04 --> 4557.14]  If we kill our brother
[4557.14 --> 4558.46]  And cover up his blood
[4558.46 --> 4559.74]  Come let's sell him
[4559.74 --> 4562.62]  And now
[4562.62 --> 4563.46]  Near the end
[4563.46 --> 4564.28]  Of the story
[4564.28 --> 4565.50]  This time
[4565.50 --> 4566.90]  It is again Judah
[4566.90 --> 4568.10]  Who steps forward
[4568.10 --> 4569.96]  But now
[4569.96 --> 4572.38]  He offers his own life
[4572.38 --> 4573.62]  For his brothers
[4573.62 --> 4575.80]  He makes not simply
[4575.80 --> 4577.02]  A plea for mercy
[4577.02 --> 4578.98]  But he makes
[4578.98 --> 4579.62]  An offering
[4579.62 --> 4581.00]  Of substitutionary
[4581.00 --> 4581.80]  Suffering
[4581.80 --> 4583.88]  He says
[4583.88 --> 4584.94]  Now then
[4584.94 --> 4585.72]  Let me
[4585.72 --> 4586.60]  Your servant
[4586.60 --> 4587.50]  Remain here
[4587.50 --> 4588.92]  As my lord's slave
[4588.92 --> 4590.24]  In place of the boy
[4590.24 --> 4592.24]  Let the boy return
[4592.24 --> 4593.32]  With his brothers
[4593.32 --> 4596.30]  And when Joseph
[4596.30 --> 4597.50]  Hears this
[4597.50 --> 4599.38]  He can't contain
[4599.38 --> 4600.40]  His emotions
[4600.40 --> 4601.54]  Anymore
[4601.54 --> 4602.70]  And he finally
[4602.70 --> 4603.48]  Bursts out
[4603.48 --> 4604.18]  And he says
[4604.18 --> 4604.40]  To them
[4604.40 --> 4605.12]  I am Joseph
[4605.12 --> 4606.02]  I am the one
[4606.02 --> 4607.14]  You sold into slavery
[4607.14 --> 4608.16]  And then he adds
[4608.16 --> 4609.68]  Do not be distressed
[4609.68 --> 4610.84]  And do not be angry
[4610.84 --> 4611.62]  With yourselves
[4611.62 --> 4612.76]  For selling me here
[4612.76 --> 4613.84]  Because it was
[4613.84 --> 4615.16]  To save lives
[4615.16 --> 4616.32]  That God sent me
[4616.32 --> 4617.34]  Ahead of you
[4617.34 --> 4620.26]  And then eventually
[4620.26 --> 4621.96]  Jacob and all the family
[4621.96 --> 4623.46]  Move to Egypt
[4623.46 --> 4625.34]  And Joseph settles them
[4625.34 --> 4626.70]  In the land of Goshen
[4626.70 --> 4628.40]  Where they are fruitful
[4628.40 --> 4630.30]  And increase in number
[4630.30 --> 4631.48]  Calling back
[4631.48 --> 4632.02]  All the way
[4632.02 --> 4632.64]  To Genesis
[4632.64 --> 4633.86]  One and two
[4633.86 --> 4636.00]  And after 17 years
[4636.00 --> 4637.28]  Of living in Egypt
[4637.28 --> 4638.62]  Jacob dies
[4638.62 --> 4640.40]  And again
[4640.40 --> 4641.26]  His brothers
[4641.26 --> 4642.14]  Are worried
[4642.14 --> 4642.92]  That Joseph
[4642.92 --> 4643.66]  Will take
[4643.66 --> 4644.90]  Revenge on them
[4644.90 --> 4646.14]  And that's where
[4646.14 --> 4646.68]  We pick up
[4646.68 --> 4647.42]  This last part
[4647.42 --> 4648.00]  Of the story
[4648.00 --> 4651.18]  Genesis 50
[4651.18 --> 4652.68]  Starting at verse 15
[4652.68 --> 4656.46]  When Joseph's brothers
[4656.46 --> 4657.64]  Saw that their father
[4657.64 --> 4658.22]  Was dead
[4658.22 --> 4659.46]  They said
[4659.46 --> 4660.30]  What if Joseph
[4660.30 --> 4661.08]  Holds a grudge
[4661.08 --> 4661.70]  Against us
[4661.70 --> 4662.58]  And pays us back
[4662.58 --> 4663.38]  For all the wrongs
[4663.38 --> 4664.02]  We did to him
[4664.02 --> 4666.16]  So they sent word
[4666.16 --> 4666.74]  To Joseph
[4666.74 --> 4667.18]  Saying
[4667.18 --> 4668.22]  Your father
[4668.22 --> 4669.28]  Left these instructions
[4669.28 --> 4670.32]  Before he died
[4670.32 --> 4671.50]  This is what you are
[4671.50 --> 4672.38]  To say to Joseph
[4672.38 --> 4673.92]  I ask you
[4673.92 --> 4674.54]  To forgive
[4674.54 --> 4675.20]  Your brothers
[4675.20 --> 4675.82]  The sins
[4675.82 --> 4676.58]  And the wrongs
[4676.58 --> 4677.06]  They committed
[4677.06 --> 4677.76]  In treating you
[4677.76 --> 4678.32]  So badly
[4678.32 --> 4679.98]  Now please
[4679.98 --> 4680.96]  Forgive the sins
[4680.96 --> 4681.68]  Of the servant
[4681.68 --> 4682.24]  Of God
[4682.24 --> 4683.32]  Of the God
[4683.32 --> 4683.92]  Of your father
[4683.92 --> 4685.50]  And when their message
[4685.50 --> 4686.26]  Came to him
[4686.26 --> 4687.84]  Joseph wept
[4687.84 --> 4690.14]  His brothers
[4690.14 --> 4690.76]  Then came
[4690.76 --> 4691.52]  And threw themselves
[4691.52 --> 4692.38]  Down before him
[4692.38 --> 4693.50]  We are your slaves
[4693.50 --> 4694.14]  They said
[4694.14 --> 4696.16]  But Joseph said
[4696.16 --> 4696.48]  To them
[4696.48 --> 4697.84]  Do not be afraid
[4697.84 --> 4699.18]  Am I in the place
[4699.18 --> 4699.68]  Of God
[4699.68 --> 4700.74]  You intended
[4700.74 --> 4701.48]  To harm me
[4701.48 --> 4702.20]  But God
[4702.20 --> 4702.80]  Intended it
[4702.80 --> 4703.34]  For good
[4703.34 --> 4704.00]  To accomplish
[4704.00 --> 4704.58]  What is now
[4704.58 --> 4705.18]  Being done
[4705.18 --> 4706.08]  The saving
[4706.08 --> 4707.16]  Of many lives
[4707.16 --> 4708.50]  So then
[4708.50 --> 4709.50]  Don't be afraid
[4709.50 --> 4710.82]  I will provide
[4710.82 --> 4711.30]  For you
[4711.30 --> 4712.06]  And your children
[4712.06 --> 4713.44]  And he reassured
[4713.44 --> 4713.72]  Them
[4713.72 --> 4715.12]  And spoke kindly
[4715.12 --> 4715.70]  To them
[4715.70 --> 4718.22]  Joseph stayed
[4718.22 --> 4718.70]  In Egypt
[4718.70 --> 4719.48]  Along with his
[4719.48 --> 4720.22]  Father's family
[4720.22 --> 4721.00]  He lived
[4721.00 --> 4722.04]  110 years
[4722.04 --> 4722.70]  And saw
[4722.70 --> 4723.80]  The third generation
[4723.80 --> 4724.92]  Of Ephraim's children
[4724.92 --> 4726.16]  And also the children
[4726.16 --> 4726.84]  Of Machir
[4726.84 --> 4727.96]  Son of Manasseh
[4727.96 --> 4729.08]  Were placed at birth
[4729.08 --> 4730.00]  On Joseph's knees
[4730.00 --> 4731.86]  Then Joseph said
[4731.86 --> 4732.48]  To his brothers
[4732.48 --> 4734.20]  I am about to die
[4734.20 --> 4735.64]  But God will surely
[4735.64 --> 4736.52]  Come to your aid
[4736.52 --> 4737.26]  And take you up
[4737.26 --> 4738.16]  Out of this land
[4738.16 --> 4738.70]  To the land
[4738.70 --> 4739.22]  He promised
[4739.22 --> 4739.70]  On oath
[4739.70 --> 4740.24]  To Abraham
[4740.24 --> 4741.06]  Isaac
[4741.06 --> 4741.72]  And Jacob
[4741.72 --> 4742.94]  And Joseph
[4742.94 --> 4743.80]  Made the Israelites
[4743.80 --> 4744.62]  Swear an oath
[4744.62 --> 4745.02]  And said
[4745.02 --> 4746.18]  God will surely
[4746.18 --> 4747.18]  Come to your aid
[4747.18 --> 4748.00]  And then you must
[4748.00 --> 4749.08]  Carry my bones
[4749.08 --> 4750.24]  Up from this place
[4750.24 --> 4752.28]  So Joseph died
[4752.28 --> 4752.90]  At the age
[4752.90 --> 4753.60]  Of 110
[4753.60 --> 4755.02]  And after they
[4755.02 --> 4755.62]  Embalmed him
[4755.62 --> 4756.30]  He was placed
[4756.30 --> 4756.94]  In a coffin
[4756.94 --> 4758.36]  In Egypt
[4758.36 --> 4759.82]  This is the word
[4759.82 --> 4760.22]  Of the Lord
[4760.22 --> 4765.66]  You intended to harm
[4765.66 --> 4766.00]  Me
[4766.00 --> 4767.94]  But God intended
[4767.94 --> 4769.46]  It for good
[4769.46 --> 4770.58]  To accomplish
[4770.58 --> 4771.18]  What is now
[4771.18 --> 4771.78]  Being done
[4771.78 --> 4772.92]  The saving
[4772.92 --> 4774.98]  Of many lives
[4774.98 --> 4778.26]  Throughout this series
[4778.26 --> 4779.92]  We have been
[4779.92 --> 4780.84]  Holding up
[4780.84 --> 4782.42]  Two truths
[4782.42 --> 4783.68]  On the one hand
[4783.68 --> 4784.44]  The sovereignty
[4784.44 --> 4785.16]  Of God
[4785.16 --> 4785.60]  Right
[4785.60 --> 4786.94]  Displayed now
[4786.94 --> 4787.36]  For us
[4787.36 --> 4788.20]  In this story
[4788.20 --> 4789.38]  In that God
[4789.38 --> 4790.22]  Has used
[4790.22 --> 4791.20]  These particular
[4791.20 --> 4791.92]  Evils
[4791.92 --> 4793.26]  For his
[4793.26 --> 4794.12]  Particular
[4794.12 --> 4794.86]  Good
[4794.86 --> 4795.84]  He has used
[4795.84 --> 4796.86]  The intentions
[4796.86 --> 4798.00]  Of his brothers
[4798.00 --> 4799.52]  For his good
[4799.52 --> 4800.80]  And glory
[4800.80 --> 4802.62]  Sovereignty
[4802.62 --> 4804.04]  Is the idea
[4804.04 --> 4805.10]  That God
[4805.10 --> 4805.72]  Rules
[4805.72 --> 4806.60]  And reigns
[4806.60 --> 4807.44]  Over all
[4807.44 --> 4808.64]  Of creation
[4808.64 --> 4809.50]  That nothing
[4809.50 --> 4810.28]  Happens
[4810.28 --> 4811.18]  Without his
[4811.18 --> 4811.92]  Will
[4811.92 --> 4812.90]  In him
[4812.90 --> 4813.68]  We live
[4813.68 --> 4814.38]  And move
[4814.38 --> 4815.02]  And have
[4815.02 --> 4815.88]  Our being
[4815.88 --> 4817.16]  From the grand
[4817.16 --> 4817.82]  Sweeping
[4817.82 --> 4818.50]  Movements
[4818.50 --> 4819.32]  Of history
[4819.32 --> 4820.16]  In the
[4820.16 --> 4820.82]  Machinations
[4820.82 --> 4821.98]  Of political
[4821.98 --> 4822.50]  Power
[4822.50 --> 4823.24]  And personal
[4823.24 --> 4823.88]  Scheming
[4823.88 --> 4824.58]  To the
[4824.58 --> 4825.90]  Singular hair
[4825.90 --> 4826.66]  Falling out
[4826.66 --> 4827.38]  Of our
[4827.38 --> 4828.26]  Heads
[4828.26 --> 4829.40]  God is
[4829.40 --> 4830.62]  In control
[4830.62 --> 4832.34]  Now sometimes
[4832.34 --> 4833.32]  This is called
[4833.32 --> 4834.62]  Big God
[4834.62 --> 4835.44]  Theology
[4835.44 --> 4837.22]  I have a friend
[4837.22 --> 4838.12]  Who was a missionary
[4838.12 --> 4839.02]  In Africa
[4839.02 --> 4840.58]  For a period
[4840.58 --> 4841.00]  Of time
[4841.00 --> 4842.34]  And he would
[4842.34 --> 4842.88]  Tell us
[4842.88 --> 4843.88]  About a song
[4843.88 --> 4844.82]  That they would
[4844.82 --> 4845.24]  Sing
[4845.24 --> 4845.60]  When they
[4845.60 --> 4845.94]  Gathered
[4845.94 --> 4846.22]  Together
[4846.22 --> 4846.60]  Worship

[4848.86 --> 4850.78]  And that's
[4850.78 --> 4851.34]  What it means
[4851.34 --> 4851.72]  For him
[4851.72 --> 4852.44]  To be king
[4852.44 --> 4853.96]  Right
[4853.96 --> 4854.50]  That God
[4854.50 --> 4855.58]  Is sovereign
[4855.58 --> 4856.04]  That he

[4858.70 --> 4859.62]  Happens
[4859.62 --> 4860.64]  Not by chance
[4860.64 --> 4861.94]  But by his

[4888.96 --> 4889.36]  Story
[4889.36 --> 4890.44]  Says
[4890.44 --> 4891.16]  If God
[4891.16 --> 4891.74]  Were small
[4891.74 --> 4892.04]  Enough
[4892.04 --> 4892.38]  To be

[4900.36 --> 4901.14]  Is worthy
[4901.14 --> 4902.00]  Of
[4902.00 --> 4902.84]  Worship
[4902.84 --> 4903.34]  That's
[4903.34 --> 4903.82]  What
[4903.82 --> 4904.52]  Sovereignty
[4904.52 --> 4905.70]  Means
[4905.70 --> 4907.76]  And the
[4907.76 --> 4907.92]  Other
[4907.92 --> 4908.26]  Thing
[4908.26 --> 4908.54]  That we

[4931.18 --> 4931.30]  You
[4931.30 --> 4931.54]  Missed
[4931.54 --> 4931.72]  It
[4931.72 --> 4932.64]  Excellent
[4932.64 --> 4932.94]  Movie

[4936.62 --> 4936.98]  You
[4936.98 --> 4937.50]  That
[4937.50 --> 4937.66]  The
[4937.66 --> 4938.02]  World
[4938.02 --> 4938.46]  Isn't
[4938.46 --> 4938.60]  The
[4938.60 --> 4938.90]  Way
[4938.90 --> 4939.30]  It's
[4939.30 --> 4939.68]  Supposed
[4939.68 --> 4939.82]  To
[4939.82 --> 4940.06]  Be
[4940.06 --> 4940.48]  Right
[4940.48 --> 4940.62]  That
[4940.62 --> 4941.18]  Life
[4941.18 --> 4941.44]  Is
[4941.44 --> 4941.74]  Full
[4941.74 --> 4941.94]  Of
[4941.94 --> 4942.42]  Trials
[4942.42 --> 4942.84]  And
[4942.84 --> 4943.34]  Struggles
[4943.34 --> 4943.56]  And
[4943.56 --> 4944.18]  Temptations
[4944.18 --> 4944.70]  And
[4944.70 --> 4945.18]  Traumas
[4945.18 --> 4945.50]  And
[4945.50 --> 4945.64]  That
[4945.64 --> 4946.32]  Sometimes
[4946.32 --> 4946.94]  It
[4946.94 --> 4947.22]  Just
[4947.22 --> 4947.72]  Seems
[4947.72 --> 4948.38]  Impossible
[4948.38 --> 4949.14]  To
[4949.14 --> 4949.40]  Bear
[4949.40 --> 4951.04]  And
[4951.04 --> 4951.18]  In
[4951.18 --> 4951.42]  This
[4951.42 --> 4951.78]  Series
[4951.78 --> 4952.14]  We
[4952.14 --> 4952.30]  Have
[4952.30 --> 4952.44]  Been
[4952.44 --> 4952.70]  Looking
[4952.70 --> 4952.92]  At
[4952.92 --> 4953.18]  How
[4953.18 --> 4953.40]  We
[4953.40 --> 4953.60]  Can
[4953.60 --> 4954.10]  Trust
[4954.10 --> 4954.60]  The
[4954.60 --> 4955.14]  Sovereignty
[4955.14 --> 4955.42]  Of
[4955.42 --> 4955.82]  God
[4955.82 --> 4956.28]  In
[4956.28 --> 4956.44]  The
[4956.44 --> 4956.82]  Midst
[4956.82 --> 4957.14]  Of
[4957.14 --> 4957.46]  Our
[4957.46 --> 4958.14]  Suffering
[4958.14 --> 4959.46]  And
[4959.46 --> 4960.02]  Joseph's
[4960.02 --> 4960.38]  Story
[4960.38 --> 4960.70]  Is
[4960.70 --> 4961.30]  Really
[4961.30 --> 4962.12]  Compelling
[4962.12 --> 4962.82]  In
[4962.82 --> 4963.06]  This
[4963.06 --> 4963.34]  Way
[4963.34 --> 4964.92]  Right
[4964.92 --> 4965.28]  Especially
[4965.28 --> 4965.72]  Now
[4965.72 --> 4966.18]  Standing
[4966.18 --> 4966.50]  Here
[4966.50 --> 4966.66]  At
[4966.66 --> 4966.80]  The
[4966.80 --> 4967.08]  End
[4967.08 --> 4967.22]  Of
[4967.22 --> 4967.40]  The
[4967.40 --> 4967.92]  Story
[4967.92 --> 4969.24]  Right
[4969.24 --> 4969.46]  Our
[4969.46 --> 4970.42]  Perspective
[4970.42 --> 4971.14]  Changes
[4971.14 --> 4972.58]  Because
[4972.58 --> 4972.76]  We
[4972.76 --> 4972.88]  Are
[4972.88 --> 4973.06]  Given
[4973.06 --> 4973.24]  A
[4973.24 --> 4973.62]  Glimpse
[4973.62 --> 4973.98]  Into
[4973.98 --> 4974.48]  Something
[4974.48 --> 4974.96]  And
[4974.96 --> 4975.10]  A
[4975.10 --> 4975.40]  Truth
[4975.40 --> 4976.18]  But
[4976.18 --> 4976.32]  In
[4976.32 --> 4976.48]  The
[4976.48 --> 4976.74]  Middle
[4976.74 --> 4976.94]  Of
[4976.94 --> 4977.10]  The
[4977.10 --> 4977.56]  Story
[4977.56 --> 4979.28]  It
[4979.28 --> 4979.40]  Can
[4979.40 --> 4979.50]  Be
[4979.50 --> 4979.74]  Really
[4979.74 --> 4979.96]  Hard
[4979.96 --> 4980.14]  To
[4980.14 --> 4980.32]  See
[4980.32 --> 4982.80]  Right
[4982.80 --> 4982.96]  When
[4982.96 --> 4983.32]  Joseph
[4983.32 --> 4983.76]  Cried
[4983.76 --> 4984.00]  Out
[4984.00 --> 4984.20]  From
[4984.20 --> 4984.38]  The
[4984.38 --> 4984.96]  Cistern
[4984.96 --> 4986.58]  Did
[4986.58 --> 4986.84]  God
[4986.84 --> 4987.10]  Really
[4987.10 --> 4987.36]  Not
[4987.36 --> 4987.58]  Hear
[4987.58 --> 4987.84]  Him
[4987.84 --> 4990.24]  But
[4990.24 --> 4990.40]  When
[4990.40 --> 4990.78]  Everything
[4990.78 --> 4990.98]  In
[4990.98 --> 4991.10]  His
[4991.10 --> 4991.42]  Life
[4991.42 --> 4991.76]  Was
[4991.76 --> 4992.42]  Endless
[4992.42 --> 4992.92]  Struggle
[4992.92 --> 4993.28]  After
[4993.28 --> 4993.76]  Endless
[4993.76 --> 4994.18]  Struggle
[4994.18 --> 4994.48]  After
[4994.48 --> 4994.94]  Endless
[4994.94 --> 4995.34]  Struggle
[4995.34 --> 4996.08]  Impossible
[4996.08 --> 4996.74]  Situation
[4996.74 --> 4997.00]  After
[4997.00 --> 4997.44]  Impossible
[4997.44 --> 4998.00]  Situation
[4998.00 --> 4998.50]  After
[4998.50 --> 4999.00]  Impossible
[4999.00 --> 4999.58]  Situation
[4999.58 --> 5000.00]  When
[5000.00 --> 5000.58]  Everything
[5000.58 --> 5001.04]  Seemed
[5001.04 --> 5001.22]  To
[5001.22 --> 5001.36]  Be
[5001.36 --> 5001.60]  Going
[5001.60 --> 5002.24]  Absolutely
[5002.24 --> 5002.90]  Wrong
[5002.90 --> 5003.14]  For
[5003.14 --> 5003.46]  Joseph
[5003.46 --> 5003.86]  Was
[5003.86 --> 5004.08]  God
[5004.08 --> 5004.26]  Not
[5004.26 --> 5004.50]  There
[5004.50 --> 5007.76]  Because
[5007.76 --> 5007.92]  In
[5007.92 --> 5008.06]  That
[5008.06 --> 5008.44]  Moment
[5008.44 --> 5009.50]  That's
[5009.50 --> 5009.64]  Sure
[5009.64 --> 5009.78]  What
[5009.78 --> 5009.90]  It
[5009.90 --> 5010.12]  Feels
[5010.12 --> 5010.46]  Like
[5010.46 --> 5012.94]  But
[5012.94 --> 5013.18]  Joseph
[5013.18 --> 5013.62]  Says
[5013.62 --> 5014.78]  Because
[5014.78 --> 5015.20]  It
[5015.20 --> 5015.38]  Was
[5015.38 --> 5015.54]  To
[5015.54 --> 5015.88]  Save
[5015.88 --> 5016.42]  Lives
[5016.42 --> 5016.64]  That
[5016.64 --> 5016.86]  God
[5016.86 --> 5017.20]  Sent
[5017.20 --> 5017.46]  Me
[5017.46 --> 5018.26]  Ahead
[5018.26 --> 5018.40]  Of
[5018.40 --> 5018.56]  You
[5018.56 --> 5019.68]  You
[5019.68 --> 5020.20]  Intended
[5020.20 --> 5020.40]  To
[5020.40 --> 5020.70]  Harm
[5020.70 --> 5020.94]  Me
[5020.94 --> 5021.14]  But
[5021.14 --> 5021.46]  God
[5021.46 --> 5021.82]  Intended
[5021.82 --> 5021.96]  It
[5021.96 --> 5022.12]  For
[5022.12 --> 5022.42]  Good
[5022.42 --> 5022.88]  To
[5022.88 --> 5023.30]  Accomplish
[5023.30 --> 5023.42]  What
[5023.42 --> 5023.50]  Is
[5023.50 --> 5023.70]  Now
[5023.70 --> 5023.94]  Being
[5023.94 --> 5024.24]  Done
[5024.24 --> 5024.64]  The
[5024.64 --> 5024.98]  Saving
[5024.98 --> 5025.16]  Of
[5025.16 --> 5025.34]  Many
[5025.34 --> 5025.72]  Lives
[5025.72 --> 5026.34]  God
[5026.34 --> 5026.74]  Was
[5026.74 --> 5027.10]  There
[5027.10 --> 5027.96]  God
[5027.96 --> 5028.34]  Was
[5028.34 --> 5028.80]  Working
[5028.80 --> 5029.60]  He
[5029.60 --> 5029.80]  Was
[5029.80 --> 5030.10]  Hidden
[5030.10 --> 5031.06]  Yes
[5031.06 --> 5032.32]  But
[5032.32 --> 5032.46]  He
[5032.46 --> 5032.64]  Was
[5032.64 --> 5033.12]  Also
[5033.12 --> 5033.58]  In
[5033.58 --> 5034.30]  Complete

[5037.54 --> 5037.76]  Of
[5037.76 --> 5038.20]  God
[5038.20 --> 5038.68]  Is
[5038.68 --> 5038.96]  Not
[5038.96 --> 5039.22]  The
[5039.22 --> 5039.60]  Same
[5039.60 --> 5039.88]  As
