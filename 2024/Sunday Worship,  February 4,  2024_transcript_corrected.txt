[0.00 → 3.20] Holy is the Lord
[3.20 → 23.88] I've seen shame
[23.88 → 27.24] The kind that comes from mistakes
[27.24 → 30.26] The kind that won't go away
[30.26 → 32.00] When I turned around
[32.00 → 34.92] They were up there to remind me
[34.92 → 36.66] I've seen regret
[36.66 → 40.42] The kind that messes with your head
[40.42 → 43.48] The failures and they can't forget
[43.48 → 45.22] But standing in now
[45.22 → 48.12] I'm thanking God it's behind me
[48.12 → 50.16] Because I've seen nails
[50.16 → 51.94] God hands reach out
[51.94 → 54.16] And wipe it all away
[54.16 → 57.02] Now I see grace
[57.02 → 60.26] Hallelujah, I stand amazed
[60.26 → 63.56] I'm staring at an empty grave
[63.56 → 67.46] And the stone that you rolled away
[67.46 → 70.28] When I was a prodigal
[70.28 → 71.54] You saw so
[71.54 → 73.62] When I left the night and I
[73.62 → 74.98] You saw one
[74.98 → 76.64] And just like that
[76.64 → 79.90] All my past has been erased
[79.90 → 81.66] When I look back
[81.66 → 83.50] I see grace
[83.50 → 86.74] I still hurt
[86.74 → 86.76] I still hurt
[86.76 → 90.00] Fall short on what you say I'm worth
[90.00 → 91.96] And that devil says
[91.96 → 93.94] I don't deserve what you did
[93.94 → 94.78] On the cross
[94.78 → 95.56] And he's right
[95.56 → 96.34] Because I don't
[96.34 → 98.38] But you did it anyway
[98.38 → 99.98] I see grace
[99.98 → 103.18] Hallelujah, I stand amazed
[103.18 → 106.42] I'm staring at an empty grave
[106.42 → 106.52] I'm staring at an empty grave
[106.52 → 109.72] And the stone that you rolled away
[109.72 → 113.12] When I was a prodigal
[113.12 → 114.32] You saw so
[114.32 → 117.70] When I left the night and I knew someone
[117.70 → 119.42] And just like that
[119.42 → 122.66] All my past has been erased
[122.66 → 124.66] When I look back
[124.66 → 126.86] I see grace
[126.86 → 127.72] Grace
[127.72 → 132.26] God's grace
[132.26 → 135.42] Grace that is greater than all my sin
[135.42 → 136.66] Faith God Almighty
[136.66 → 138.76] Homecoming
[138.76 → 138.96] please
[142.86 → 142.96] Prayer
[142.96 → 143.84] Hope
[143.84 → 144.76] I was a snake
[144.76 → 146.80] Come keep
[146.80 → 147.18] a dozen
[147.18 → 147.64] And sing

[150.98 → 151.90] I see grace
[151.90 → 153.90] I see grace
[153.90 → 155.04] Hallelujah, I stand amazed
[155.66 → 156.58] It's amazing
[156.58 → 158.10] You do
[158.10 → 159.04] You do
[159.04 → 159.54] Our holiness

[165.68 → 167.68] KO
[195.68 → 197.68] Oh, grace.
[197.68 → 199.68] Oh, grace.
[199.68 → 205.68] Grace that is greater than all I see.
[225.68 → 227.68] Oh, grace.
[227.68 → 229.68] Thank you.
[229.68 → 231.68] Thank you.
[255.68 → 258.68] He's coming on the clouds.
[258.68 → 262.68] Kings and kingdoms will bow down.
[266.68 → 269.68] And every chain will break.
[269.68 → 273.68] His broken hearts declare his praise.
[273.68 → 278.68] Who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[278.68 → 284.68] Our God is the lion, the lion of doom.
[284.68 → 286.68] Good morning.
[286.68 → 290.68] Welcome to church this morning.
[290.68 → 294.68] If you are a guest with us, my name is Chris, and I'm one of the pastors here.
[294.68 → 300.68] And it's my privilege, along with a few others, to lead in our worship together this morning.
[300.68 → 303.68] Before we begin, there are a couple announcements to make.
[303.68 → 305.68] And so I'm going to invite Linda to come up to the front.
[305.68 → 307.68] And then after Linda, Nikki's going to come up.
[307.68 → 311.68] And they're going to roll through just a couple announcements.
[311.68 → 317.68] I did want to announce, while they're making their way up, that youth coffee is this morning.
[317.68 → 320.68] And so that's for people in our youth program.
[320.68 → 330.68] Or if you are in that age group of grade eight through high school, you can go hang out at the Orleans house after church today for coffee and lunch and the like.
[330.68 → 332.68] And so Orleans, wave your hands.
[332.68 → 333.68] There you go.
[333.68 → 334.68] Need directions.
[334.68 → 335.68] That's them.
[335.68 → 336.68] Or Pastor Kevin can also help.
[336.68 → 337.68] Kevin, wave your hand.
[337.68 → 338.68] There he is.
[338.68 → 341.68] He'll get you there together.
[341.68 → 342.68] Please.
[342.68 → 343.68] Good morning.
[343.68 → 347.68] My name is Linda, and I'm from the women's ministry team.
[347.68 → 352.68] I just want to give you an update on the women's retreat that's coming up March the 8th.
[352.68 → 356.68] Just to remind you, registration deadline is February the 9th.
[356.68 → 359.68] And the payment deadline is February 16th.
[359.68 → 363.68] If you did sign up, put your name on the list, you should have received an email.
[363.68 → 367.68] And that email would have given you a link with all the registration details.
[367.68 → 374.68] If you need help with the registration or if you'd like to sign up or if you have questions, we'll be at the Connect booth at the back of the church.
[374.68 → 379.68] So come and join us, and we'll talk to you then.
[379.68 → 381.68] Good morning.
[381.68 → 388.68] I just want to draw your attention again to an initiative that we are joining here in Langley, the coldest night of the year.
[388.68 → 391.68] And this is happening on February 24th.
[391.68 → 393.68] So in a few weeks now.
[393.68 → 399.68] If you look up here, you can see just a wonderful group of people that you might want to be a part of this year.
[399.68 → 403.68] If you haven't or if you have and want to be a part of it again.
[403.68 → 412.68] We are walking and raising awareness for issues such as poverty and homelessness, addiction in our community and supporting the Gateway of Hope,
[412.68 → 418.68] which is a local organization who works with people struggling with those things every day.
[418.68 → 427.68] So if you want to be a part of the team, you would be committing to doing some sort of fundraising or raising awareness for this organization.
[427.68 → 433.68] And then on February 24, we gather at Gateway of Hope with everybody who has supported them.
[433.68 → 437.68] Together we walk a five kilometre route that they have mapped out.
[437.68 → 443.68] And then you are welcome to also stay there for a light meal at Gateway of Hope.
[443.68 → 447.68] And you can chat with others from our team or other teams.
[447.68 → 452.68] And then that all is kind of wrapped up between, I don't remember the times.
[452.68 → 456.68] I think it's kind of between 5 and 7 p.m. on the 24th.
[456.68 → 459.68] But you can come and ask me or Google it for more info.
[459.68 → 461.68] We'd love to have you on our team.
[461.68 → 468.68] In the past, a few years ago, we were their number one fundraisers for a couple of years.
[468.68 → 473.68] And we were kind of challenged by the Living Waters, I think.
[473.68 → 479.68] They kind of beat us out last year and wanted to join a friendly competition, which we haven't committed to.
[479.68 → 481.68] But if, you know, we blew them out of the water, why not?
[481.68 → 483.68] So come and join us if you have questions.
[483.68 → 486.68] Feel free to talk to me after the service.
[487.68 → 490.68] Nicky, did you just invite us to blow them out of the Living Water?
[490.68 → 498.68] Living Waters Church is also one of our, was last season one of our rivals in baseball.
[498.68 → 500.68] And they beat us there, so we need to beat them here.
[503.68 → 506.68] Before we begin, one last announcement.
[506.68 → 510.68] Thursday night, Cadets was hosted here.
[510.68 → 514.68] And there was a pair of glasses that were left after that event.
[514.68 → 519.68] So if you were part of Cadets or picked up or dropped off one of the boys at Cadets and you left your glasses here,
[519.68 → 521.68] talk to me afterwards.
[521.68 → 522.68] I have them in my study.
[522.68 → 524.68] I would love to give them to you.
[524.68 → 528.68] Let's stand together as we come into God's presence for worship.
[532.68 → 541.68] We gather in the presence of our good God, and we receive his greeting as he meets us in this place in power.
[541.68 → 550.68] Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, Son, and our Saviour,
[550.68 → 553.68] through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[554.68 → 555.68] Amen.
[556.68 → 559.68] I'm going to invite you to turn to those around you and welcome them into worship.
[559.68 → 562.68] That can be with a handshake or a head nod.
[564.68 → 566.68] .
[566.68 → 567.68] .
[567.68 → 579.68] Isaiah 60 verses 1 to 3 says,

[640.68 → 648.30] Oh, church of God, say, church of our own
[648.30 → 652.30] In the call of Christ our captain
[652.30 → 658.16] For now we say that they are strong
[658.16 → 661.64] In the strength of God's healing
[661.64 → 667.16] Shield of faith and of truth
[667.16 → 672.12] We stand against the devil's lies
[672.12 → 677.66] On and on, the battle of God is born
[677.66 → 681.04] Reaching out to the walls of God
[681.04 → 694.84] Our call to the Lord, to love the Catholic soul
[694.84 → 698.76] But to reach the midst of the captain
[698.76 → 704.50] In this war, that makes the world more
[704.50 → 707.82] In the life with faith and power
[707.82 → 713.48] In this with child on every side
[713.48 → 717.80] They know the outcome is secure
[717.80 → 723.94] And Christ will have, the price for which he died
[723.94 → 727.92] Where the earth is the nation
[727.92 → 737.98] A bright shine for your light as bright
[737.98 → 747.32] A bright shine for the risen sun
[747.32 → 757.30] Lift your eyes, you are His great and bright
[757.30 → 764.72] The rise of church, O God
[764.72 → 771.32] I see Christ, where love and mercy means
[771.86 → 775.32] As the Son of God is stricken
[775.32 → 781.50] And see His foes, my flesh beneath His feet
[781.50 → 785.48] For the conqueror is risen
[785.48 → 790.44] As the Son of God is all awake
[790.44 → 795.24] And Christ emerges from His grave
[795.24 → 799.32] His pleasure comes to His sin
[799.32 → 801.32] And He will be the King
[801.32 → 803.50] Every heart and heart shall see
[803.50 → 805.50] And He will be the King
[805.50 → 809.48] He is the Holy Spirit, God

[1293.62 → 1303.62] Forgive us when we get lost in the mystery of your sovereignty and spiral with questions in our mind instead of bringing everything to you in worship, even our doubts.
[1303.62 → 1313.62] Offer us your mercy again and open our hearts to understand the magnitude of what you have done for us as you will reveal to us in your word.
[1313.62 → 1321.62] Open our eyes that we may see past our apathy towards your gospel and truly see the sacrifice you gave on the cross.
[1321.62 → 1329.62] That your Son, Jesus Christ, died the death we deserve, taking our sin upon himself.
[1329.62 → 1336.62] That in Christ's victory over the grave, we rise with him in victory to live as sons and daughters of eternity.
[1336.62 → 1344.62] May we not be deaf to this truth, but joyfully submit our lives to you as a living sacrifice in graceful worship.
[1344.62 → 1356.62] May we know and live this truth as we are reminded in the Heidelberg Catechism and Lord's Day One, proclaiming what our only comfort in life and death is.
[1356.62 → 1365.62] That I am not my own, but belong, body and soul, and life and death, and my faithful Saviour, Jesus Christ.
[1365.62 → 1375.62] He was the only day for all my sins with his precious blood, and that set me free from the tyranny of the devil.
[1375.62 → 1384.62] He also watches over me in such a way that my care can fall from my head without the will of my Father in heaven.
[1384.62 → 1389.62] In fact, all things must work together for my salvation.
[1389.62 → 1396.62] Because I belong to him, Christ, by his Holy Spirit, assures me of eternal life,
[1396.62 → 1402.62] and makes me wholeheartedly willing and ready from now on to live with the kingdom.
[1402.62 → 1423.62] I belong to him.
[1423.62 → 1430.62] So bring me the joy of my salvation.
[1430.62 → 1439.62] Take me back to where it all began.
[1439.62 → 1451.62] Lord, I am the one who is your presence.
[1451.62 → 1453.62] How I want you.
[1453.62 → 1455.62] I want you.
[1455.62 → 1458.62] Be there once again.
[1458.62 → 1467.62] And if I, that the world can't put out then the flame,
[1467.62 → 1477.62] till loving between us remains, my life is an altar to you.
[1477.62 → 1488.02] Breathe again on the endless heaven in my heart
[1488.02 → 1492.56] I'm not taken back to the start
[1492.56 → 1496.82] My life is an altar to you
[1496.82 → 1506.92] You will be a pure and living spirit
[1506.92 → 1517.32] Take me back to where it all He had
[1517.32 → 1524.84] For it all He gave so long the game
[1528.84 → 1535.04] How I longed you to be there once again
[1535.04 → 1543.44] Light a fire that the world can't burn out and burn away
[1543.44 → 1548.44] Fill my pain between us today
[1548.44 → 1553.44] My life is an altar to you
[1553.44 → 1563.44] Breathe again on the embers that burn in my heart
[1563.44 → 1567.44] And love to take me back to the start
[1567.44 → 1571.84] My life is an altar to you
[1571.84 → 1577.84] But I'm sorry
[1577.84 → 1583.84] Please forgive me
[1583.84 → 1589.84] For when I'm gone cold
[1589.84 → 1594.24] Lord I need you
[1594.24 → 1598.64] How I need you
[1598.64 → 1602.64] To awake my heart
[1602.64 → 1604.64] And I'm sorry
[1604.64 → 1610.64] That the world can't burn out and burn away
[1610.64 → 1614.64] Till nothing between us remains
[1614.64 → 1623.04] My life is an altar to you
[1623.04 → 1629.04] Breathe again on the embers that burn in my heart
[1629.04 → 1633.04] I'm not taken back to the start
[1633.04 → 1637.44] My life is an altar to you
[1637.44 → 1651.76] As open, as you trail
[1651.76 → 1652.44] I'm not taken from now
[1652.44 → 1653.44] I'm not taken from now
[1653.44 → 1655.32] Your lack is an altar to you
[1655.32 → 1656.40] Plant that burn in my heart
[1656.40 → 1657.88] My life is an altar to you
[1657.88 → 1664.50] All the earth will shout your praise
[1664.50 → 1669.26] Our hearts will cry, all foes will sing
[1669.26 → 1676.70] Great are you, Lord
[1676.70 → 1682.84] All the earth will shout your praise
[1682.84 → 1687.62] Our hearts will cry, all foes will sing
[1687.62 → 1694.46] Great are you, Lord
[1694.46 → 1701.12] All the earth will shout your praise
[1701.12 → 1705.92] Our hearts will cry, all foes will sing
[1705.92 → 1713.28] Great are you, Lord
[1713.28 → 1718.58] It's your breath in our lungs
[1718.58 → 1721.84] So we pour out our praise
[1721.84 → 1723.88] We pour out our praise
[1723.88 → 1727.58] It's your breath in our lungs
[1727.58 → 1730.84] So we pour out our praise
[1730.84 → 1732.58] You always
[1732.58 → 1736.70] It's your breath in our lungs
[1736.70 → 1740.00] So we pour out our praise
[1740.00 → 1741.96] We pour out our praise
[1741.96 → 1745.72] It's your breath in our lungs
[1745.72 → 1748.86] So we pour out our praise
[1748.86 → 1762.36] God, I'm sorry
[1762.36 → 1768.40] Please forgive me
[1768.40 → 1774.28] For when I've gone cold
[1774.28 → 1777.96] Lord, I need you
[1777.96 → 1782.84] How I need you
[1782.84 → 1789.24] To awake my soul
[1789.24 → 1814.50] For you are deep and broken within
[1814.50 → 1820.16] Overwhelmed by the weight of your sin
[1820.16 → 1822.92] Jesus is calling
[1822.92 → 1830.76] Have you come to the end of yourself?
[1830.76 → 1835.80] Do you thirst for a drink from the well?
[1835.80 → 1838.46] Jesus is calling
[1838.46 → 1845.18] Welcome to the altar
[1845.18 → 1850.80] The Father's arms are open wide
[1850.80 → 1855.62] Forgiveness was bought with
[1855.62 → 1861.80] The precious blood of Jesus Christ
[1861.80 → 1872.18] Jesus is calling
[1872.18 → 1873.42] Leave your mind
[1873.42 → 1876.38] To the press and the states
[1876.38 → 1878.06] Come today
[1878.06 → 1881.16] There's no reason to wait
[1881.16 → 1883.72] Jesus is calling
[1883.72 → 1888.72] Bring your sorrows
[1888.72 → 1890.80] And drink and the joy
[1890.80 → 1893.38] When the ashes
[1893.38 → 1895.94] A new life is born
[1895.94 → 1898.54] Jesus is calling
[1898.54 → 1905.18] Welcome to the altar
[1905.18 → 1910.52] The Father's arms are open wide
[1910.52 → 1915.12] Forgiveness was bought with
[1915.12 → 1919.80] The precious blood of Jesus Christ
[1919.80 → 1920.40] Oh, Jesus Christ
[1920.40 → 1922.24] Forgiveness was bought with
[1922.24 → 1929.20] The precious blood of Jesus Christ
[1929.20 → 1934.74] Forgiveness was bought with
[1934.74 → 1941.50] The precious blood of Jesus Christ.
[1951.50 → 1961.12] Our Saviour, isn't He wonderful?
[1961.12 → 1968.40] Sing Alleluia, Christ is risen.
[1970.88 → 1981.16] Bow down before Him, for He is Lord of all.
[1981.16 → 1987.32] Sing Alleluia, Christ is risen.
[1991.12 → 1993.62] Oh, what a Saviour.
[1995.94 → 1999.54] Isn't He wonderful?
[2000.68 → 2006.12] Sing Alleluia, Christ is risen.
[2009.12 → 2018.12] Bow down before Him, for He is Lord of all.
[2018.12 → 2025.12] Sing Alleluia, Christ is risen.
[2025.12 → 2032.12] Bow down before Him, for He is Lord of all.
[2032.12 → 2034.40] Come to the altar.
[2034.40 → 2039.98] The Father's arms are open wide.
[2040.34 → 2049.40] Forgiveness was bought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ.
[2049.40 → 2056.40] May He is Lord of all.
[2056.40 → 2058.68] The Father's arms are open wide.
[2058.68 → 2068.40] Forgiveness was bought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ.
[2068.40 → 2069.40] He is Lord of all.
[2069.40 → 2070.40] He is Lord of all.
[2070.40 → 2071.40] He is Lord of all.
[2071.40 → 2073.40] He is Lord of all.
[2073.40 → 2074.40] He is Lord of all.
[2074.40 → 2078.40] He is Lord of all.
[2078.40 → 2082.40] Bear your cross as you wait for the crown.
[2082.40 → 2088.40] Tell the world of the treasure you've found.
[2088.40 → 2105.40] Tell the Lord of all.
[2105.40 → 2115.76] Before we worship in our offering, we just wanted to take a moment and acknowledge and send and pray for the Ranked family.
[2116.62 → 2122.46] Some of you have heard already, but Justin has accepted the call to be the lead pastor
[2122.46 → 2125.38] at Fleetwood CRC over in Fleetwood.
[2125.80 → 2130.76] And so they will be, they're not cheering because you left, they're excited for you
[2130.76 → 2133.08] and your professional career.
[2135.58 → 2141.84] And so the Rafts have been with us for a little while, about a year now, and they
[2141.84 → 2146.82] became part of us in the midst of transitions in life and the like.
[2147.70 → 2151.36] And we have been their church family for the last year.
[2151.48 → 2156.18] And so we really did want to send you guys out with prayer and with blessing.
[2156.96 → 2159.06] And so we're going to do that really quickly.
[2159.06 → 2164.34] And so Rafts, those of you who have agreed to come up to the front, would you please
[2164.34 → 2167.92] come up to the front, and we're going to pray over you together.
[2171.84 → 2178.28] Why don't you come up here for a moment, and then we'll move down in a second.
[2179.74 → 2181.94] I know I didn't say all the way up on stage.
[2182.04 → 2182.62] Sorry, girls.
[2183.84 → 2184.18] No, no, no.
[2184.24 → 2185.76] I mean, like now all the way.
[2185.80 → 2187.90] I didn't warn you all the way up on stage.
[2188.02 → 2188.30] Sorry.
[2190.42 → 2192.44] We're all just fumbling our way forward here.
[2192.54 → 2192.98] That's it.
[2192.98 → 2201.04] Our prayer for you and for your family is Paul's prayer in Romans 15.
[2201.82 → 2202.46] Paul says,
[2202.80 → 2208.76] May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him so that you may overflow
[2208.76 → 2211.72] with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
[2211.72 → 2219.54] We want that for you as you begin in this community, in this service, and in this Church of Jesus
[2219.54 → 2219.96] Christ.
[2220.48 → 2227.06] And as you go from us to lead them, may you always know that God is with you and go in
[2227.06 → 2228.54] the hope and the power of his name.
[2229.50 → 2233.38] Justin, in your work, always remember Paul's words to Timothy.
[2234.10 → 2234.64] He says,
[2234.64 → 2235.42] Preach the word.
[2235.84 → 2238.06] Be prepared in season and out of season.
[2238.26 → 2242.58] Correct, rebuke, and encourage with great patience and careful instruction.
[2243.36 → 2246.54] For the time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine.
[2246.98 → 2251.28] Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers
[2251.28 → 2254.22] to say what their itching ears want to hear.
[2255.18 → 2258.36] They'll turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths.
[2259.08 → 2263.06] But you, keep your head in all situations, endure hardship,
[2263.06 → 2268.42] do the work of the evangelist, and discharge all the duties of your ministry.
[2269.40 → 2273.60] That's the call for the work that we are privileged to do.
[2274.12 → 2278.86] I pray that the Lord surrounds you not with people whose ears are itching for what they
[2278.86 → 2284.12] want to hear, but for whose ears are longing for the words of Christ.
[2284.80 → 2287.42] May you preach to them the words of Christ.
[2288.30 → 2292.32] We're going to pray over Justin and Amanda and their family, and so I'm going to invite you
[2292.32 → 2293.60] guys to go down in front of the table.
[2294.70 → 2298.92] If you're an elder here, or if you've been on a journey of life and faith with the Racks,
[2299.26 → 2304.14] or if you just love them and want to pray over them, we invite you to come up now at this time,
[2304.60 → 2310.48] lay hands on them, and if you don't want to come to the front but would like to hold your hand out
[2310.48 → 2314.08] in so doing, we invite you and encourage you to do that as well.
[2314.08 → 2333.44] Holy God and Heavenly Father,
[2334.40 → 2341.88] from the beginning of time, you have called people into service for your name,
[2341.88 → 2346.40] and you have charged them to proclaim your gospel.
[2348.54 → 2351.94] God, how beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news,
[2352.48 → 2358.14] and how absolutely critical for our salvation is the proclamation of that truth.
[2358.14 → 2366.06] And so for Justin, and for the whole Ranked family, we pray your blessing upon them now.
[2367.50 → 2371.68] Send them out in the power of your Holy Spirit that they might know your constant provision,
[2372.14 → 2378.24] they might know your constant nearness, they might know your constant always and forever love.
[2378.24 → 2386.06] And with Paul, we pray, may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him,
[2386.56 → 2390.50] so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
[2391.00 → 2393.74] In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[2394.56 → 2394.94] Amen.
[2394.94 → 2400.56] You may have to see. Thank you.
[2404.22 → 2407.88] Justin officially starts tomorrow at Fleetwood,
[2408.04 → 2410.84] and so if you can grab them after service and encourage them
[2410.84 → 2413.26] and send them out with a blessing, that would be appreciated.
[2414.22 → 2416.12] Now we can invite the deacon up to the front.
[2416.12 → 2416.16] Amen.
[2416.16 → 2416.56] Amen.
[2424.94 → 2443.00] Good morning.
[2443.58 → 2448.34] Today's offering is for name through North American Indigenous Ministries.
[2448.34 → 2453.46] Tim and Charity Johnson and their family work with the Shushan First Nations
[2453.46 → 2457.08] to develop relationships with youth and young families.
[2457.66 → 2462.50] They are working towards a grounded and strong identity and understanding
[2462.50 → 2466.44] of whom the creator is and the love he has for all people.
[2466.74 → 2467.20] Thank you.
[2467.20 → 2467.26] Thank you.
[2467.26 → 2471.26] Thank you.
[2483.46 → 2485.46] Thank you.
[2485.46 → 2513.44] Thank you.
[2513.46 → 2520.46] Jesus, I give you all.
[2520.46 → 2528.94] Every part of me cries out your name.
[2528.94 → 2534.20] Jesus, I give you all.
[2534.20 → 2564.18] Lord, I want to be pleasing to you.
[2564.20 → 2565.04] Lord, I want you all.
[2565.04 → 2576.02] Lord, I want you all to hold my light and be the one that you shine through.
[2577.20 → 2584.70] Jesus, I give you all.
[2584.70 → 2588.74] Every heart of me
[2588.74 → 2591.44] Rise out shortly
[2591.44 → 2597.28] Jesus I give you all
[2597.28 → 2603.44] And all in glory
[2603.44 → 2607.48] And all in glory
[2607.48 → 2610.88] And all in glory
[2610.88 → 2618.72] Jesus I give you all
[2618.72 → 2623.10] Every heart of me
[2623.10 → 2626.06] Rise out shortly
[2626.06 → 2633.06] Jesus I give you all
[2633.06 → 2637.18] Living and holy
[2637.18 → 2640.66] Living and holy
[2640.66 → 2643.18] Living and holy
[2643.18 → 2647.02] Living and holy for you
[2647.02 → 2659.14] Good morning
[2659.14 → 2660.30] If I can invite all the
[2660.30 → 2661.44] I think three-year-olds
[2661.44 → 2662.24] Up to grade four
[2662.24 → 2664.52] Come on up for a children's blessing
[2664.52 → 2675.30] Hi guys
[2675.30 → 2677.78] It's been a while since I've seen you
[2677.78 → 2678.38] How are you?
[2679.20 → 2679.72] Good
[2679.72 → 2681.68] Hey do you guys know what the term
[2681.68 → 2683.84] All in means?
[2684.64 → 2685.16] No
[2685.16 → 2687.26] When you're all in on something
[2687.26 → 2689.58] You put in all the cards
[2689.58 → 2691.28] You put in all your energy
[2691.28 → 2693.10] What do you think that means?
[2693.10 → 2694.92] Going full out
[2694.92 → 2695.94] Fully committed
[2695.94 → 2697.62] Well when it comes to Lego
[2697.62 → 2698.72] I'm all in
[2698.72 → 2699.68] Can you tell?
[2700.54 → 2701.88] I got me a hat
[2701.88 → 2703.94] And I got me a watch
[2703.94 → 2705.86] And I got me a homemade necklace
[2705.86 → 2708.24] And I take the catalogues with me
[2708.24 → 2709.02] Everywhere I go
[2709.02 → 2710.00] Just in case
[2710.00 → 2711.28] The Christmas one
[2711.28 → 2712.46] And the recent one
[2712.46 → 2713.68] Maybe you guys just got it
[2713.68 → 2714.08] In the mail
[2714.08 → 2716.18] I even packed a little bit of Lego
[2716.18 → 2717.72] Along for the afternoon
[2717.72 → 2719.40] I won't play with it in church
[2719.40 → 2720.76] So I'll pay attention
[2720.76 → 2722.54] But I brought this Lego set
[2722.54 → 2723.24] Right?
[2723.62 → 2724.60] I can show you guys later
[2724.60 → 2725.62] Oh man
[2725.62 → 2726.58] Is there anything you guys
[2726.58 → 2727.62] Are all in about?
[2728.46 → 2729.64] What do you guys have ideas?
[2734.54 → 2734.90] You're
[2734.90 → 2735.84] Oh really?
[2735.90 → 2736.86] You're also all in about Lego?
[2736.94 → 2737.40] What about

[3110.74 → 3112.40] Share a better
[3112.40 → 3113.44] Understanding of
[3113.44 → 3113.94] The role of the
[3113.94 → 3114.58] Creator in their
[3114.58 → 3114.98] Lives
[3114.98 → 3116.88] Father we think
[3116.88 → 3117.58] About the message
[3117.58 → 3118.08] That we are
[3118.08 → 3119.28] Going to hear today
[3119.28 → 3121.20] That we are to
[3121.20 → 3122.40] Be living sacrifices
[3122.40 → 3123.84] That we will not
[3123.84 → 3124.78] Be conformed to
[3124.78 → 3125.40] The patterns of
[3125.40 → 3125.84] This world
[3125.84 → 3126.82] But be transformed
[3126.82 → 3128.14] By the renewing
[3128.14 → 3128.80] Of our minds
[3128.80 → 3130.46] We pray for
[3130.46 → 3131.02] Chris who will
[3131.02 → 3132.26] Be leading us
[3132.26 → 3134.72] In that time
[3134.72 → 3135.28] Of reflection
[3135.28 → 3136.34] And we pray
[3136.34 → 3137.30] That the words
[3137.30 → 3137.84] He shares
[3137.84 → 3138.78] Will be an
[3138.78 → 3139.52] Accurate reflection
[3139.52 → 3140.18] Of your will
[3140.18 → 3140.94] For our lives
[3140.94 → 3142.64] Father we pray
[3142.64 → 3143.54] All these things
[3143.54 → 3144.92] Not because we
[3144.92 → 3146.08] Not because we
[3146.08 → 3146.66] Deserve it
[3146.66 → 3147.34] But we ask it
[3147.34 → 3148.08] In Jesus name
[3148.08 → 3149.38] Amen
[3149.38 → 3164.96] If you have one

[3165.68 → 3166.00] I'm going to
[3166.00 → 3166.30] In front of you
[3166.30 → 3166.86] I want you to
[3166.86 → 3168.00] Open a Bible
[3168.00 → 3169.80] If you would
[3169.80 → 3170.22] Like one
[3170.22 → 3170.68] There's a few
[3170.68 → 3171.24] At the back

[3171.96 → 3173.18] You can also
[3173.18 → 3174.70] Turn your device
[3174.70 → 3175.24] On if you have
[3175.24 → 3175.66] One of those
[3175.66 → 3176.18] With the Bible
[3176.18 → 3176.88] App on it
[3176.88 → 3178.00] Follow along
[3178.00 → 3179.10] We're going to
[3179.10 → 3180.00] Read this morning
[3180.00 → 3181.08] From Romans 12
[3181.08 → 3182.72] Verse 1 and 2

[3185.52 → 3186.20] For us together
[3186.20 → 3186.82] The first time
[3186.82 → 3187.38] Through it will be
[3187.38 → 3187.86] On the screen
[3187.86 → 3188.34] Behind me
[3188.34 → 3192.52] Therefore I urge
[3192.52 → 3193.78] You brothers and
[3193.78 → 3195.14] Sisters in view
[3195.14 → 3196.42] Of God's mercy
[3196.42 → 3197.94] To offer your
[3197.94 → 3199.22] Bodies as a
[3199.22 → 3200.32] Living sacrifice
[3200.32 → 3201.96] Holy and pleasing
[3201.96 → 3202.62] To God
[3202.62 → 3204.54] This is your
[3204.54 → 3206.06] True and proper
[3206.06 → 3206.96] Worship
[3206.96 → 3208.50] Do not conform
[3208.50 → 3209.10] To the pattern
[3209.10 → 3209.86] Of this world
[3209.86 → 3211.04] But be transformed
[3211.04 → 3212.36] By the renewing
[3212.36 → 3213.76] Of your mind
[3213.76 → 3215.78] Then you will
[3215.78 → 3216.34] Be able to
[3216.34 → 3217.28] Test and approve
[3217.28 → 3218.12] What God's
[3218.12 → 3218.96] Will is
[3218.96 → 3219.92] His good
[3219.92 → 3220.98] Pleasing
[3220.98 → 3222.02] And perfect
[3222.02 → 3223.06] Will
[3223.06 → 3224.56] This is the
[3224.56 → 3224.90] Word of the
[3224.90 → 3225.10] Lord
[3225.10 → 3231.58] So

[3244.64 → 3245.10] Oh you're
[3245.10 → 3245.60] Preaching on
[3245.60 → 3246.36] Romans 12

[3254.40 → 3254.92] For today

[3259.50 → 3260.18] 17 years
[3260.18 → 3260.38] Ago
[3260.38 → 3260.92] That math
[3260.92 → 3261.30] Is right
[3261.30 → 3261.66] Correct
[3261.66 → 3262.12] Yeah
[3262.12 → 3262.38] Good
[3262.38 → 3266.12] And
[3266.12 → 3268.02] That truth
[3268.02 → 3268.86] Notwithstanding
[3268.86 → 3269.54] May I
[3269.54 → 3270.34] Just say
[3270.34 → 3270.72] That
[3270.72 → 3271.44] Rachel
[3271.44 → 3272.20] Has learned
[3272.20 → 3273.08] With grace
[3273.08 → 3273.46] What it
[3273.46 → 3273.76] Means
[3273.76 → 3274.30] To be
[3274.30 → 3274.82] A living
[3274.82 → 3275.52] Sacrifice
[3275.52 → 3276.06] Over these

[3278.38 → 3278.64] Me
[3278.64 → 3280.62] And I've
[3280.62 → 3280.90] Learned
[3280.90 → 3281.14] What it
[3281.14 → 3281.34] Means
[3281.34 → 3281.60] To be
[3281.60 → 3282.14] Transformed

[3295.24 → 3296.04] This
[3296.04 → 3297.06] Text
[3297.06 → 3298.32] And the
[3298.32 → 3298.82] Reason why
[3298.82 → 3299.12] I thought
[3299.12 → 3299.32] It was
[3299.32 → 3299.74] Fitting for
[3299.74 → 3300.12] My wedding

[3300.56 → 3300.76] Years
[3300.76 → 3301.30] Ago
[3301.30 → 3304.56] I hope
[3304.56 → 3305.08] We will
[3305.08 → 3305.36] See

[3310.74 → 3312.54] Is to

[3312.80 → 3313.08] All to
[3313.08 → 3313.34] God
[3313.34 → 3315.42] That's
[3315.42 → 3315.56] Our
[3315.56 → 3315.96] Theme
[3315.96 → 3317.02] In this
[3317.02 → 3317.32] Text
[3317.32 → 3318.16] The only

[3330.54 → 3330.74] The
[3330.74 → 3331.10] Word
[3331.10 → 3331.64] Therefore
[3331.64 → 3333.52] I had
[3333.52 → 3333.96] A professor
[3333.96 → 3335.22] In seminary
[3335.22 → 3335.60] Who would

[3338.64 → 3339.38] You read
[3339.38 → 3339.92] The word
[3339.92 → 3340.44] Therefore
[3340.44 → 3341.18] You should
[3341.18 → 3341.86] Always ask
[3341.86 → 3342.24] What's
[3342.24 → 3342.44] It
[3342.44 → 3342.72] There
[3342.72 → 3343.06] For

[3355.14 → 3355.60] To
[3355.60 → 3356.82] Logically

[4105.28 → 4105.74] Death
[4105.74 → 4107.58] Because
[4107.58 → 4107.70] In
[4107.70 → 4107.84] Many
[4107.84 → 4108.10] Ways
[4108.10 → 4108.56] It
[4108.56 → 4108.88] Is
[4108.88 → 4110.14] Death
[4110.14 → 4114.10] But
[4114.10 → 4114.22] If
[4114.22 → 4114.32] You
[4114.32 → 4114.42] Know
[4114.42 → 4114.58] The
[4114.58 → 4115.06] Gospel
[4115.06 → 4116.74] If
[4116.74 → 4116.80] You
[4116.80 → 4116.88] Know
[4116.88 → 4117.00] The
[4117.00 → 4117.32] Gospel
[4117.32 → 4117.56] Of
[4117.56 → 4117.82] Jesus
[4117.82 → 4118.06] You
[4118.06 → 4118.28] Know
[4118.28 → 4118.52] That
[4118.52 → 4119.00] On
[4119.00 → 4119.16] The
[4119.16 → 4119.46] Other
[4119.46 → 4119.88] Side
[4119.88 → 4120.10] Of
[4120.10 → 4120.58] Death
[4120.58 → 4122.16] Is
[4122.16 → 4122.64] Life
[4122.64 → 4124.04] True
[4124.04 → 4124.52] Life
[4124.52 → 4125.06] Real
[4125.06 → 4125.92] Life
[4125.92 → 4126.48] The
[4126.48 → 4127.22] Paradox
[4127.22 → 4127.54] Of
[4127.54 → 4127.88] Living
[4127.88 → 4128.76] Sacrifice
[4128.76 → 4129.26] Means
[4129.26 → 4130.00] Living
[4130.00 → 4130.32] For
[4130.32 → 4130.88] Yourself
[4130.88 → 4131.16] Is
[4131.16 → 4131.68] Ultimately
[4131.68 → 4132.30] Being
[4132.30 → 4132.60] Stuck
[4132.60 → 4132.82] In
[4132.82 → 4133.18] Death
[4133.18 → 4134.46] And
[4134.46 → 4135.00] Dying
[4135.00 → 4135.26] To
[4135.26 → 4135.64] Self
[4135.64 → 4135.84] On
[4135.84 → 4135.98] The
[4135.98 → 4136.30] Cross
[4136.30 → 4136.54] With
[4136.54 → 4136.90] Jesus
[4136.90 → 4137.26] Is
[4137.26 → 4137.94] Actually
[4137.94 → 4138.60] Where
[4138.60 → 4138.80] You
[4138.80 → 4139.28] Find
[4139.28 → 4139.90] True
[4139.90 → 4140.72] Life
[4140.72 → 4143.06] This
[4143.06 → 4144.14] Is
[4144.14 → 4144.32] Your
[4144.32 → 4144.70] True
[4144.70 → 4144.94] And
[4144.94 → 4145.34] Proper
[4145.34 → 4146.26] Worship
[4146.26 → 4148.66] That's
[4148.66 → 4148.96] What Paul
[4148.96 → 4149.30] Says
[4149.30 → 4151.56] Sometimes
[4151.56 → 4153.58] We
[4153.58 → 4153.98] Think
[4153.98 → 4154.98] That
[4154.98 → 4155.40] Worship
[4155.40 → 4156.66] Is
[4156.66 → 4157.06] About
[4157.06 → 4157.28] What
[4157.28 → 4157.44] We
[4157.44 → 4157.72] Do
[4157.72 → 4158.16] On
[4158.16 → 4158.56] Sunday
[4158.56 → 4158.80] The
[4158.80 → 4159.08] Singing
[4159.08 → 4159.30] Of
[4159.30 → 4159.64] Songs
[4159.64 → 4159.78] And
[4159.78 → 4159.90] The
[4159.90 → 4160.16] Praying
[4160.16 → 4160.32] Of
[4160.32 → 4160.70] Prayers
[4160.70 → 4160.84] And
[4160.84 → 4160.96] The
[4160.96 → 4161.26] Listening
[4161.26 → 4162.12] To
[4162.12 → 4162.40] Of
[4162.40 → 4162.82] Sermons
[4162.82 → 4162.96] The
[4162.96 → 4163.62] Participating
[4163.62 → 4164.16] In
[4164.16 → 4164.30] The
[4164.30 → 4164.68] Sacraments
[4164.68 → 4164.82] And
[4164.82 → 4165.10] Don't
[4165.10 → 4165.18] Get
[4165.18 → 4165.50] Wrong
[4165.50 → 4165.70] Of
[4165.70 → 4165.86] Course
[4165.86 → 4166.08] That's
[4166.08 → 4166.34] Part
[4166.34 → 4166.46] Of
[4166.46 → 4166.64] It
[4166.64 → 4167.86] Right
[4167.86 → 4168.50] But
[4168.50 → 4168.78] That
[4168.78 → 4169.14] Kind
[4169.14 → 4169.32] Of
[4169.32 → 4169.70] Worship
[4169.70 → 4170.20] Is
[4170.20 → 4170.42] The
[4170.42 → 4171.02] Fuel
[4171.02 → 4171.38] Is
[4171.38 → 4171.56] The
[4171.56 → 4172.32] Means
[4172.32 → 4172.62] Of
[4172.62 → 4173.12] Grace
[4173.12 → 4173.72] For
[4173.72 → 4173.88] The
[4173.88 → 4174.18] Kind
[4174.18 → 4174.36] Of
[4174.36 → 4174.68] Worship
[4174.68 → 4174.92] That
[4174.92 → 4175.14] Goes
[4175.14 → 4175.40] From
[4175.40 → 4175.66] This
[4175.66 → 4176.06] Place
[4176.06 → 4176.34] And
[4176.34 → 4177.00] Says
[4177.00 → 4177.72] In
[4177.72 → 4178.38] Everything
[4178.38 → 4179.40] I
[4179.40 → 4180.14] Give
[4180.14 → 4180.26] It
[4180.26 → 4180.46] Up
[4180.46 → 4181.04] I
[4181.04 → 4181.30] Put
[4181.30 → 4181.52] To
[4181.52 → 4181.82] Death
[4181.82 → 4182.06] I
[4182.06 → 4183.00] Offer
[4183.00 → 4183.14] It
[4183.14 → 4183.36] As
[4183.36 → 4183.54] A
[4183.54 → 4184.32] Sacrifice
[4184.32 → 4185.22] My
[4185.22 → 4185.24] My
[4185.24 → 4185.26] My
[4185.26 → 4185.76] Choice
[4185.76 → 4186.34] And
[4186.34 → 4186.56] My
[4186.56 → 4187.22] Everything
[4187.22 → 4187.96] Over
[4187.96 → 4188.16] To
[4188.16 → 4188.44] God
[4188.44 → 4190.06] Worship
[4190.06 → 4190.50] Is
[4190.50 → 4191.36] Sacrificing
[4191.36 → 4191.60] Your
[4191.60 → 4192.14] Narrow
[4192.14 → 4192.68] Joy
[4192.68 → 4193.16] For
[4193.16 → 4193.32] The
[4193.32 → 4193.70] Joy
[4193.70 → 4194.04] Of
[4194.04 → 4194.40] Joining
[4194.40 → 4194.64] In
[4194.64 → 4194.96] God's
[4194.96 → 4195.38] Mission
[4195.38 → 4196.20] Worship
[4196.20 → 4196.50] Is
[4196.50 → 4197.24] Sacrificing
[4197.24 → 4197.40] Your
[4197.40 → 4197.78] Narrow
[4197.78 → 4198.14] Joy
[4198.14 → 4198.36] For
[4198.36 → 4198.50] The
[4198.50 → 4198.76] Joy
[4198.76 → 4198.96] Of
[4198.96 → 4199.26] Joining
[4199.26 → 4199.52] With
[4199.52 → 4199.82] God
[4199.82 → 4200.04] Being
[4200.04 → 4200.52] United
[4200.52 → 4201.06] With
[4201.06 → 4201.40] Christ
[4201.40 → 4202.12] Only
[4202.12 → 4202.40] To
[4202.40 → 4202.92] Find
[4202.92 → 4203.76] That
[4203.76 → 4204.18] Such
[4204.18 → 4205.14] Sacrificing
[4205.14 → 4205.82] Leads
[4205.82 → 4206.14] To
[4206.14 → 4206.86] Eternal
[4206.86 → 4207.74] Joy
[4207.74 → 4209.60] That
[4209.60 → 4209.74] It's
[4209.74 → 4209.92] The
[4209.92 → 4210.22] Only
[4210.22 → 4210.66] Thing
[4210.66 → 4210.86] That
[4210.86 → 4211.10] Makes
[4211.10 → 4211.56] Sense
[4211.56 → 4211.80] In
[4211.80 → 4212.42] Response
[4212.42 → 4212.66] To
[4212.66 → 4213.02] God's
[4213.02 → 4213.56] Mercy
[4213.56 → 4215.94] And
[4215.94 → 4216.06] In
[4216.06 → 4216.24] Fact
[4216.24 → 4217.56] It's
[4217.56 → 4217.70] Not
[4217.70 → 4217.90] Really
[4217.90 → 4218.32] Clear
[4218.32 → 4218.68] In
[4218.68 → 4219.20] In
[4219.20 → 4219.32] The
[4219.32 → 4219.94] Translation
[4219.94 → 4220.74] That
[4220.74 → 4220.88] We
[4220.88 → 4221.12] Have
[4221.12 → 4221.38] Here
[4221.38 → 4221.58] In
[4221.58 → 4221.76] Front
[4221.76 → 4221.90] Of
[4221.90 → 4222.16] Us
[4222.16 → 4223.74] That
[4223.74 → 4223.88] We
[4223.88 → 4224.12] Read
[4224.12 → 4224.44] From
[4224.44 → 4225.68] Paul
[4225.68 → 4226.82] Describes
[4226.82 → 4227.56] The
[4227.56 → 4228.48] Offering
[4228.48 → 4228.70] Of
[4228.70 → 4228.84] Your
[4228.84 → 4229.26] Bodies
[4229.26 → 4229.50] As
[4229.50 → 4229.74] Living
[4229.74 → 4230.50] Sacrifices
[4230.50 → 4230.82] Holy
[4230.82 → 4231.06] And
[4231.06 → 4231.34] Pleasing
[4231.34 → 4231.48] To
[4231.48 → 4231.70] God
[4231.70 → 4231.86] He
[4231.86 → 4232.04] Says
[4232.04 → 4232.34] This
[4232.34 → 4232.84] Is
[4232.84 → 4233.36] Your
[4233.36 → 4233.80] True
[4233.80 → 4234.12] And
[4234.12 → 4234.64] Proper
[4234.64 → 4235.56] Worship
[4235.56 → 4236.82] That
[4236.82 → 4237.36] Phrase
[4237.36 → 4237.74] True
[4237.74 → 4237.98] And
[4237.98 → 4238.40] Proper
[4238.40 → 4239.16] Is
[4239.16 → 4239.52] Actually
[4239.52 → 4239.84] Just
[4239.84 → 4240.18] One
[4240.18 → 4240.48] Word
[4240.48 → 4240.70] In
[4240.70 → 4241.00] Greek
[4241.00 → 4242.32] And
[4242.32 → 4242.42] The
[4242.42 → 4242.64] Word
[4242.64 → 4242.88] Is
[4242.88 → 4243.54] Logion
[4243.54 → 4244.74] It's
[4244.74 → 4244.88] The
[4244.88 → 4245.24] Word
[4245.24 → 4245.54] From
[4245.54 → 4245.72] Which
[4245.72 → 4245.86] We
[4245.86 → 4246.00] Get
[4246.00 → 4246.58] Logic
[4246.58 → 4247.08] Or
[4247.08 → 4247.68] Logical
[4247.68 → 4247.92] It
[4247.92 → 4248.16] Means
[4248.16 → 4248.86] Rational
[4248.86 → 4249.48] Or
[4249.48 → 4250.24] Logically
[4250.24 → 4251.10] Consequent
[4251.10 → 4252.78] And
[4252.78 → 4253.34] Here's
[4253.34 → 4253.58] Why I
[4253.58 → 4253.68] Think
[4253.68 → 4253.84] That
[4253.84 → 4254.26] Matters
[4254.26 → 4254.44] Right
[4254.44 → 4254.84] Because
[4254.84 → 4255.34] It's
[4255.34 → 4255.98] Only
[4255.98 → 4256.52] In
[4256.52 → 4257.08] Light
[4257.08 → 4257.12] Love
[4287.08 → 4295.06] of yourself is actually irrational. That's Paul's point. That's the thing
[4295.06 → 4308.02] that's so amazing about grace. If what God did in Jesus Christ doesn't move you,
[4308.02 → 4315.82] you haven't comprehended it completely yet or fully enough yet. And let me say
[4315.82 → 4320.56] it again, right? Because here's the point. To the outside world, that is to people who don't know
[4320.56 → 4327.04] Jesus in this way, that won't make any sense. In fact, it can't make sense. As we've just seen,
[4327.08 → 4331.24] it can't make sense because they haven't experienced God's mercy. They haven't experienced
[4331.24 → 4336.80] the truth that justification is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone. They haven't
[4336.80 → 4341.94] been united with Christ in his sufferings and so united with him in his resurrection.
[4341.94 → 4350.38] What you believe in and who you are, what you do with your life because of that belief,
[4350.68 → 4355.00] isn't going to make sense to your unbelieving friends.
[4357.60 → 4362.68] Here's two or three really easy examples, but you can figure out the application for yourself.
[4363.84 → 4367.62] What do you mean you gave $10,000 to your church last year?
[4367.62 → 4372.44] Don't you know what kind of vacation you could go on for that money?
[4375.24 → 4380.74] What do you mean you're not having sex till you're married? It's just sex and it feels good.
[4383.00 → 4387.64] What do you mean you don't have a TikTok account? Doesn't everyone your age have a TikTok account?
[4387.64 → 4393.60] That's what's Nora. She gave me the glaring eyes.
[4395.60 → 4396.92] On and on the list goes.
[4399.00 → 4401.78] What you have been called to offer
[4401.78 → 4405.44] as a living sacrifice is the fullness
[4405.44 → 4406.38] of who you are.
[4407.22 → 4407.86] So I'm asking,
[4408.44 → 4410.26] what is it?
[4411.34 → 4413.32] What is it right now, today,
[4413.44 → 4415.34] that God is laying on your heart and putting in your mind?
[4415.34 → 4417.90] What is it that you are being called to offer
[4417.90 → 4418.96] as a living sacrifice?
[4419.18 → 4421.34] Because today you are saying,
[4421.62 → 4423.20] I will trust God more
[4423.20 → 4424.60] than I trust myself.
[4427.50 → 4430.10] When your Christian faith makes you peculiar
[4430.10 → 4430.96] in the world,
[4431.16 → 4433.66] you're living in line with verse 12 of our text.
[4434.06 → 4434.28] It says,
[4434.46 → 4435.22] do not conform,
[4435.64 → 4436.90] or verse 2, sorry, of our text.
[4436.98 → 4439.28] Do not conform to the pattern of this world,
[4439.36 → 4441.54] but be transformed by the renewing
[4441.54 → 4442.50] of your mind.
[4442.50 → 4444.68] Do not conform,
[4444.90 → 4446.16] but be transformed.
[4447.54 → 4448.62] Do not conform,
[4448.84 → 4450.68] but be changed
[4450.68 → 4453.12] by the renewing of your mind.
[4453.76 → 4454.52] Now that phrase,
[4454.68 → 4456.42] transformed by the renewing of your mind,
[4456.78 → 4458.56] is unique to this place
[4458.56 → 4459.96] in Paul's writing.
[4460.64 → 4461.56] The word transform
[4461.56 → 4463.42] is actually used only here
[4463.42 → 4464.74] and in one other place,
[4465.14 → 4467.54] in 2 Corinthians 3, 18,
[4467.64 → 4468.36] where Paul says,
[4468.36 → 4471.08] we who with unveiled faces
[4471.08 → 4472.92] all reflect the Lord's glory
[4472.92 → 4474.00] are being transformed
[4474.00 → 4475.72] into his likeness
[4475.72 → 4477.40] with ever-increasing glory
[4477.40 → 4479.44] which comes from the Lord.
[4480.70 → 4481.70] And so what's clear
[4481.70 → 4482.86] is that this transformation
[4482.86 → 4486.76] is about some deep inner transformation,
[4486.98 → 4488.46] some deep inner change
[4488.46 → 4490.50] that works itself out
[4490.50 → 4492.86] from the inside out in our lives.
[4492.96 → 4496.16] It's not some outward conformity.
[4496.16 → 4498.34] It's a deep change.
[4499.44 → 4501.24] We can continue digging into this.
[4501.36 → 4503.08] In Colossians 3, 16,
[4503.46 → 4504.14] we read,
[4504.64 → 4505.98] let the word of Christ
[4505.98 → 4507.48] dwell in you richly.
[4508.12 → 4508.68] And so yes,
[4508.76 → 4509.86] in this transformation,
[4510.32 → 4512.90] there's an intellectual aspect to it.
[4513.14 → 4514.76] You learn, and you know
[4514.76 → 4516.36] and you study God's word
[4516.36 → 4518.54] and you grow as a result.
[4518.68 → 4520.92] You are changed as a result.
[4522.52 → 4524.14] Ephesians 4, 23,
[4524.14 → 4527.18] says that we are to be made new
[4527.18 → 4529.48] in the attitudes of your minds.
[4530.32 → 4531.68] So part of what that means
[4531.68 → 4534.10] is that the dominating impulse
[4534.10 → 4534.90] in our mind,
[4535.06 → 4536.86] our very imaginations,
[4537.40 → 4539.60] the way we see the world
[4539.60 → 4540.82] and how we engage
[4540.82 → 4542.22] in the world around us
[4542.22 → 4543.88] is reoriented,
[4544.12 → 4546.86] is transformed by Jesus.
[4548.26 → 4549.82] And with imaginations
[4549.82 → 4551.10] captured by Christ,
[4551.20 → 4552.22] you begin to see
[4552.22 → 4553.60] that what is impossible
[4553.60 → 4555.24] for you and me
[4555.24 → 4557.92] is possible for God.
[4558.94 → 4559.74] And then Paul continues
[4559.74 → 4560.48] this idea,
[4560.60 → 4561.18] working it out.
[4561.50 → 4563.44] In 1 Corinthians 2, 13,
[4564.14 → 4565.10] Paul says that
[4565.10 → 4567.12] we speak not in words
[4567.12 → 4568.94] taught us by human wisdom,
[4568.94 → 4570.52] but in words taught
[4570.52 → 4571.30] by the Spirit,
[4571.64 → 4573.48] explaining spiritual realities
[4573.48 → 4575.82] with Spirit-taught words.
[4576.62 → 4577.66] And so pull that all together
[4577.66 → 4578.44] for our understanding
[4578.44 → 4578.92] of what it means
[4578.92 → 4579.66] to be transformed
[4579.66 → 4580.78] by the renewing of our minds.
[4580.88 → 4582.40] The Spirit of God
[4582.40 → 4584.18] takes the Word of God
[4584.18 → 4586.76] and applies it to our minds
[4586.76 → 4589.26] and then so transforms us.
[4589.50 → 4591.06] And that results
[4591.06 → 4594.42] in only one logical outcome.
[4596.04 → 4596.56] Worship.
[4597.38 → 4599.10] Worship that sacrifices
[4599.10 → 4601.56] all of me for all of Him.
[4601.56 → 4603.76] because in Him,
[4603.88 → 4604.88] I am truly,
[4605.52 → 4605.98] finally,
[4606.40 → 4608.20] fully found.
[4613.52 → 4614.56] Here's where I want to
[4614.56 → 4616.78] end this morning.
[4619.34 → 4620.48] Because after hearing
[4620.48 → 4621.90] God's Word to us today,
[4623.32 → 4625.16] my prayer
[4625.16 → 4626.62] is there are,
[4626.94 → 4628.20] there is at least
[4628.20 → 4629.46] two things
[4629.46 → 4630.48] that are clear
[4630.48 → 4631.36] and present
[4631.36 → 4632.10] in your mind.
[4633.42 → 4634.20] I'm going to name them
[4634.20 → 4635.66] because I want to be sure
[4635.66 → 4636.06] that they're there.
[4636.48 → 4636.90] First,
[4637.34 → 4639.04] every single one of you
[4639.04 → 4641.06] should be uncomfortable
[4641.06 → 4641.94] right now.
[4643.88 → 4645.46] Every single one of you
[4645.46 → 4647.04] should be feeling
[4647.04 → 4647.70] the pressures
[4647.70 → 4649.48] of this living sacrifice
[4649.48 → 4650.56] call to death.
[4651.08 → 4652.06] Every one of you.
[4653.88 → 4654.74] You should think,
[4655.14 → 4656.02] what have I missed?
[4656.02 → 4658.54] What have I been blind to?
[4659.40 → 4660.38] What have I assumed
[4660.38 → 4661.02] about life
[4661.02 → 4662.10] that's cultural
[4662.10 → 4663.68] and not biblical?
[4664.38 → 4665.26] Every one of us
[4665.26 → 4665.90] should be wondering,
[4666.24 → 4666.76] what do I need
[4666.76 → 4667.34] to sacrifice
[4667.34 → 4668.46] for the glory of God?
[4668.82 → 4669.58] What do I need
[4669.58 → 4671.20] to let go of
[4671.20 → 4672.20] in myself
[4672.20 → 4673.24] or for myself?
[4673.60 → 4675.04] The old theological term
[4675.04 → 4676.00] here is mortified.
[4676.42 → 4677.08] What do I need
[4677.08 → 4677.96] to mortify
[4677.96 → 4678.84] in my life
[4678.84 → 4679.90] to put to death?
[4680.14 → 4681.00] None of us
[4681.00 → 4682.22] escapes this call.
[4686.02 → 4687.68] And second,
[4688.52 → 4692.18] even as you wrestle
[4692.18 → 4693.74] with the uncomfortable
[4693.74 → 4696.06] calling to put things
[4696.06 → 4697.46] to death in your life,
[4698.00 → 4699.54] here's this truth.
[4700.16 → 4701.70] You can trust
[4701.70 → 4705.48] in the love of God
[4705.48 → 4708.02] because you've understood
[4708.02 → 4709.00] the mercy of God.
[4709.94 → 4710.64] Right?
[4710.66 → 4711.46] You can take comfort
[4711.46 → 4712.16] in the fact
[4712.16 → 4713.18] that there is nothing
[4713.18 → 4714.82] that can separate you
[4714.82 → 4715.80] from the love of God
[4715.80 → 4716.50] that is available
[4716.50 → 4718.18] in Christ Jesus.
[4719.88 → 4720.40] And in fact,
[4720.68 → 4721.84] it's precisely because
[4721.84 → 4722.54] there's nothing
[4722.54 → 4723.82] that can separate us
[4723.82 → 4724.46] from that love
[4724.46 → 4725.70] that we do what we do.
[4726.12 → 4727.28] It's precisely because
[4727.28 → 4727.90] there's nothing
[4727.90 → 4729.06] that can separate us
[4729.06 → 4730.04] from the love of God
[4730.04 → 4730.48] that we say,
[4730.82 → 4732.12] this I will put to death
[4732.12 → 4732.76] for Him.
[4734.64 → 4735.74] That's why we willingly
[4735.74 → 4736.76] offer ourselves
[4736.76 → 4738.08] as sacrifices.
[4738.08 → 4739.16] Not because we are trying
[4739.16 → 4740.90] to earn the love of God,
[4741.04 → 4742.34] but because we are living
[4742.34 → 4744.50] out of the love
[4744.50 → 4745.28] of God
[4745.28 → 4747.56] given to us.
[4750.22 → 4751.20] Some of you know
[4751.20 → 4754.24] that I coach Malachi,
[4754.50 → 4755.90] my son's soccer team.
[4755.98 → 4756.72] Well, I'm one of the
[4756.72 → 4757.40] assistant coaches.
[4758.24 → 4759.16] I really know nothing
[4759.16 → 4759.62] about soccer,
[4759.70 → 4760.18] so I couldn't be
[4760.18 → 4760.68] the head coach.
[4761.74 → 4762.92] But that means
[4762.92 → 4764.10] every week
[4764.10 → 4765.68] for two hours
[4765.68 → 4766.68] we have practices
[4766.68 → 4768.04] and then for an hour
[4768.04 → 4769.04] we have a game.
[4769.62 → 4770.54] Two nights a week
[4770.54 → 4771.54] for practice,
[4772.08 → 4773.10] one morning
[4773.10 → 4773.84] for a game
[4773.84 → 4774.82] and we practice together.
[4776.34 → 4776.54] Right?
[4776.60 → 4777.66] But not just those
[4777.66 → 4779.00] three times a week.
[4779.78 → 4780.62] Malachi and I
[4780.62 → 4781.56] will practice at home.
[4781.94 → 4782.54] He likes to kick
[4782.54 → 4783.16] a ball around.
[4783.28 → 4784.42] He likes to work
[4784.42 → 4786.14] on his place kicks.
[4786.24 → 4786.94] He likes to work
[4786.94 → 4787.78] on what it means
[4787.78 → 4789.02] to cross or to dribble
[4789.02 → 4789.94] and so we will
[4789.94 → 4790.64] do that together.
[4793.16 → 4794.12] He will ask me
[4794.12 → 4794.84] to train him
[4794.84 → 4797.14] and he will spend
[4797.14 → 4799.44] hours working on it.
[4800.54 → 4802.24] And I do this
[4802.24 → 4802.74] with him
[4802.74 → 4803.68] not because I love
[4803.68 → 4804.08] soccer
[4804.08 → 4806.34] but because I love
[4806.34 → 4806.66] Malachi.
[4808.96 → 4809.76] And then we come
[4809.76 → 4810.36] to game day.
[4810.96 → 4811.12] Right?
[4811.54 → 4812.40] We put all this
[4812.40 → 4813.04] training in.
[4813.54 → 4814.42] We put all this
[4814.42 → 4814.86] work in.
[4814.94 → 4815.36] We've invested
[4815.36 → 4816.22] all this time
[4816.22 → 4817.16] and if Malachi
[4817.16 → 4817.92] goes out on that
[4817.92 → 4818.40] pitch and he
[4818.40 → 4819.38] forgets everything
[4819.38 → 4820.54] that we worked on.
[4821.92 → 4822.88] If he can't even
[4822.88 → 4823.68] figure out that he's
[4823.68 → 4824.24] right-footed
[4824.24 → 4824.98] and not left-foot
[4824.98 → 4825.38] dominant,
[4826.64 → 4827.34] he goes out there
[4827.34 → 4828.10] and he flubs it
[4828.10 → 4828.92] every single time
[4828.92 → 4829.52] he gets a shot
[4829.52 → 4829.86] on net.
[4830.58 → 4831.22] Or if he goes
[4831.22 → 4831.42] out there
[4831.42 → 4831.92] and he forgets
[4831.92 → 4832.68] to cross it in.
[4834.48 → 4835.22] That doesn't
[4835.22 → 4836.26] lessen my love
[4836.26 → 4836.74] for him
[4836.74 → 4838.22] in any way.
[4841.12 → 4841.82] And Malachi
[4841.82 → 4843.76] can be confident
[4843.76 → 4844.84] of that.
[4845.20 → 4846.12] That I will not
[4846.12 → 4847.20] love him less
[4847.20 → 4849.06] based on how well
[4849.06 → 4849.68] he performs.
[4852.12 → 4852.52] But,
[4852.88 → 4854.70] you better believe
[4854.70 → 4855.22] he still wants
[4855.22 → 4855.92] to score a goal.
[4855.92 → 4857.84] You better believe
[4857.84 → 4858.36] he still wants
[4858.36 → 4859.20] to go out there
[4859.20 → 4860.26] and work his
[4860.26 → 4861.70] tail off to do it.
[4862.58 → 4863.32] He still wants
[4863.32 → 4864.42] to play really well.
[4864.48 → 4864.66] Again,
[4864.76 → 4866.04] not to gain
[4866.04 → 4866.82] my love,
[4867.00 → 4867.70] but because he's
[4867.70 → 4868.46] already loved.
[4869.28 → 4869.96] Because we've
[4869.96 → 4871.30] already invested
[4871.30 → 4872.48] so much in it
[4872.48 → 4872.80] together.
[4873.00 → 4873.52] Because he's
[4873.52 → 4874.04] already loved.
[4874.16 → 4875.54] If he doubted
[4875.54 → 4876.24] my love,
[4876.98 → 4877.60] his playing
[4877.60 → 4878.18] on the soccer
[4878.18 → 4879.98] pitch would be
[4879.98 → 4880.64] to try and earn
[4880.64 → 4880.84] it.
[4881.42 → 4882.18] To try and gain
[4882.18 → 4882.72] my love.
[4883.12 → 4883.90] And the weight
[4883.90 → 4884.94] of that would
[4884.94 → 4885.88] crush him
[4885.88 → 4887.30] and his joy
[4887.30 → 4887.80] for the game.
[4890.14 → 4891.06] But because he
[4891.06 → 4891.76] already knows
[4891.76 → 4892.88] I love him
[4892.88 → 4894.00] and he's living
[4894.00 → 4894.58] and playing
[4894.58 → 4895.40] in the security
[4895.40 → 4896.66] of that love,
[4896.76 → 4897.50] he can go on
[4897.50 → 4898.06] to that soccer
[4898.06 → 4899.04] pitch and try
[4899.04 → 4899.78] his absolute
[4899.78 → 4900.18] hardest.
[4900.50 → 4901.00] He can try
[4901.00 → 4901.84] his best to
[4901.84 → 4902.40] please me,
[4902.54 → 4903.18] to make me
[4903.18 → 4903.52] happy.
[4904.56 → 4905.26] That's a goal
[4905.26 → 4905.64] for him.
[4905.78 → 4906.66] Not to earn
[4906.66 → 4907.38] my love,
[4907.50 → 4908.32] but because
[4908.32 → 4910.40] of my love.
[4910.40 → 4912.92] That's why
[4912.92 → 4913.22] we live
[4913.22 → 4913.74] sacrificial
[4913.74 → 4914.24] lives to
[4914.24 → 4914.50] God.
[4915.72 → 4916.62] If our
[4916.62 → 4917.40] earthly fathers
[4917.40 → 4917.94] live and
[4917.94 → 4918.38] love in
[4918.38 → 4918.78] that way,
[4918.88 → 4919.30] how much
[4919.30 → 4920.06] more will
[4920.06 → 4920.54] our heavenly
[4920.54 → 4921.70] father live
[4921.70 → 4922.28] and love
[4922.28 → 4923.32] in that way?
[4923.72 → 4924.50] Because of
[4924.50 → 4925.20] his great
[4925.20 → 4925.96] love for
[4925.96 → 4926.40] us,
[4926.82 → 4927.56] the only
[4927.56 → 4928.60] logical
[4928.60 → 4929.78] response
[4929.78 → 4930.76] to
[4930.76 → 4931.88] God
[4931.88 → 4933.70] is to
[4933.70 → 4934.22] offer our
[4934.22 → 4935.10] lives as
[4935.10 → 4935.54] living

[5075.94 → 5076.40] with us

[5077.60 → 5078.16] we fell
[5078.16 → 5078.76] into sin.
[5080.46 → 5081.04] We give
[5081.04 → 5081.60] you thank
[5081.60 → 5082.22] for Jesus
[5082.22 → 5082.72] Christ,

[5087.38 → 5087.98] everlasting
[5087.98 → 5088.92] life.
[5089.38 → 5089.70] Amen.
[5091.78 → 5092.38] Our
[5092.38 → 5092.92] Lord Jesus,
[5093.36 → 5094.60] before he
[5094.60 → 5095.02] suffered,
[5095.26 → 5095.92] gave us
[5095.92 → 5096.88] this memorial
[5096.88 → 5098.22] of his
[5098.22 → 5098.84] sacrifice
[5098.84 → 5099.46] until he
[5099.46 → 5100.00] comes again.
[5100.76 → 5101.26] And the
[5101.26 → 5101.82] Lord Jesus,
[5102.08 → 5102.58] on the night
[5102.58 → 5103.06] that he was
[5103.06 → 5103.46] betrayed,
[5103.74 → 5104.32] took bread.
[5105.06 → 5105.54] And when he
[5105.54 → 5105.86] had given
[5105.86 → 5106.42] thanks,
[5106.52 → 5107.00] he broke
[5107.00 → 5107.42] it and
[5107.42 → 5107.68] said,
[5108.08 → 5108.84] this is
[5108.84 → 5109.64] my body
[5109.64 → 5110.46] which is
[5110.46 → 5110.98] for you.
[5111.90 → 5112.72] Do this
[5112.72 → 5113.62] in remembrance
[5113.62 → 5114.86] of me.
[5116.08 → 5117.00] And in
[5117.00 → 5117.68] the same
[5117.68 → 5118.12] way,
[5118.28 → 5118.88] he took
[5118.88 → 5119.40] the cup
[5119.40 → 5120.46] after supper
[5120.46 → 5120.88] saying,
[5121.34 → 5122.00] this cup
[5122.00 → 5122.58] is the
[5122.58 → 5123.18] new covenant
[5123.18 → 5124.02] in my
[5124.02 → 5124.46] blood.
[5125.72 → 5126.40] Do this
[5126.40 → 5127.16] in remembrance
[5127.16 → 5127.92] of me.
[5129.26 → 5130.14] For whenever
[5130.14 → 5131.14] we eat
[5131.14 → 5132.10] this bread
[5132.10 → 5132.76] and drink
[5132.76 → 5133.76] this cup,
[5133.96 → 5134.60] we proclaim
[5134.60 → 5135.22] the Lord's
[5135.22 → 5136.12] death until
[5136.12 → 5137.08] he comes
[5137.08 → 5137.42] again.
[5138.36 → 5139.10] This is
[5139.10 → 5139.70] the mystery
[5139.70 → 5140.22] of our
[5140.22 → 5140.58] faith.
[5142.04 → 5142.46] Your
[5142.46 → 5142.82] death,
[5142.98 → 5143.56] Christ,
[5143.74 → 5144.38] we proclaim.
[5145.14 → 5145.46] Your
[5145.46 → 5146.02] resurrection,
[5146.46 → 5147.02] we affirm
[5147.02 → 5147.66] with joy.
[5148.40 → 5148.66] Your
[5148.66 → 5149.06] coming,
[5149.28 → 5149.76] we await
[5149.76 → 5150.38] with hope.
[5151.16 → 5151.84] Glory be
[5151.84 → 5152.44] to you,
[5152.60 → 5153.18] Lord Jesus.
