[7.64 → 12.46] And you will be amazed
[12.46 → 15.96] We've just got to believe
[15.96 → 20.00] The story is so far from over
[20.00 → 24.00] So hold on to every promise
[24.56 → 27.66] God has made to us
[27.66 → 32.36] And watch this glorious unfolding
[32.36 → 40.96] We were made to run
[40.96 → 43.08] Through fields of forever
[43.08 → 47.06] Singing songs to our Saviour and King
[47.06 → 49.40] So let us remember
[49.40 → 51.48] This life we're living
[51.48 → 53.56] Is just the beginning
[53.56 → 55.78] Of the beginning
[55.78 → 61.54] Of this glorious unfolding
[61.54 → 66.14] We will watch and see
[66.14 → 69.78] And we will be amazed
[69.78 → 74.40] If we just keep on believing
[74.40 → 78.36] The story is so far from over
[78.36 → 83.06] And hold on to every promise
[83.06 → 86.06] God has made to us
[86.06 → 90.72] We'll see the glorious unfolding
[90.72 → 99.12] Just watch and see
[99.12 → 101.22] Unsounding
[101.22 → 107.80] This is just the beginning
[107.80 → 109.92] Of the beginning
[109.92 → 109.98] Of the beginning
[109.98 → 111.58] I'm voting
[111.58 → 125.28] Of the beginning
[125.28 → 129.28] Of the beginning
[129.28 → 131.08] Of the beginning
[131.08 → 132.34] Of the beginning
[132.34 → 133.04] Of the beginning
[133.04 → 148.04] You traded riches
[148.04 → 153.04] To run to my rescue
[153.04 → 157.74] Oh my Redeemer
[157.74 → 162.52] You take the pieces
[162.52 → 167.96] And turn them to praises
[167.96 → 172.46] Oh my Redeemer
[172.46 → 179.80] Oh my Redeemer
[179.80 → 185.56] Love I cannot deny

[252.04 → 255.04] My Redeemer
[255.04 → 269.98] No other one
[269.98 → 272.66] So glorious
[272.66 → 280.30] You outshine the sun
[280.30 → 284.38] No other love
[284.38 → 287.12] Like Jesus
[287.12 → 294.74] You outshine the sun
[294.74 → 302.18] You outshine the sun
[302.18 → 309.00] You outshine the sun

[335.82 → 338.32] Sure as the morning light
[338.32 → 340.14] Jesus my Redeemer
[340.14 → 344.14] Jesus my Redeemer
[344.14 → 345.14] Oh my Redeemer

[354.14 → 357.14] Jesus my Redeemer
[357.14 → 359.14] My Redeemer
[359.14 → 361.14] My Redeemer
[361.14 → 362.14] My Redeemer
[362.14 → 375.46] My Redeemer
[375.46 → 379.22] Do you shine
[379.22 → 380.72] How you shine
[380.72 → 386.24] My Redeemer
[386.24 → 386.96] When you shine
[386.96 → 388.72] My Redeemer
[388.72 → 418.70] Thank you.
[418.72 → 448.70] Thank you.
[448.72 → 478.70] Thank you.
[478.72 → 508.70] Thank you.
[508.72 → 510.72] Thank you.
[538.72 → 540.72] Thank you.
[568.72 → 570.72] Thank you.
[570.72 → 572.72] Thank you.
[572.72 → 574.72] Thank you.
[574.72 → 576.72] Thank you.
[576.72 → 580.72] Thank you.
[580.72 → 584.30] I need
[584.30 → 600.34] You give me everything, You give me everything, You give me everything I need.
[600.34 → 616.14] You give me everything, You give me everything, You give me everything I need.
[616.14 → 641.20] You give me everything, You give me everything, You give me everything.
[641.20 → 648.74] Everything I need
[671.20 → 699.82] Come Thou Fount of every blessing
[699.82 → 705.02] Tune my heart to sing Thy grace
[705.02 → 710.48] Streams of mercy never ceasing
[710.48 → 715.60] Call for songs of loudest praise
[715.60 → 721.02] Teach me some melodious sonnet
[721.02 → 726.16] Sung by flaming tongues above
[726.16 → 731.74] Praise the mount I'm fixed upon it
[731.74 → 736.66] Mount of Thy redeeming love
[736.66 → 744.16] Here I raise my Ebenezer
[744.80 → 749.44] Hither by Thy help I come
[749.44 → 755.32] And I hope by Thy good pleasure
[755.32 → 760.14] Safely to arrive at home
[760.14 → 765.92] Jesus sought me when a stranger
[765.92 → 770.44] Wandering from the fold of God
[770.44 → 776.60] He to rescue me from danger
[776.60 → 781.44] Interposed His precious blood
[781.44 → 789.94] How Your kindness yet pursues me
[789.94 → 800.52] Now you're in the middle
[800.52 → 802.48] Good morning, everyone.
[803.02 → 806.52] Good morning, everyone.
[806.52 → 807.52] That was not bad. Not bad.
[807.58 → 808.28] Good morning, everyone.
[808.42 → 811.50] Welcome to Langley Emanuel CRC this morning.
[811.90 → 813.04] My name is Kevin Robert.
[813.10 → 814.48] I'm the youth pastor here,
[814.84 → 817.22] and it's great to see so many of you here today.
[817.22 → 819.68] Before we get going started with the service,
[819.74 → 821.94] I've got just a few announcements here on my phone.
[823.16 → 827.80] Announcement number one is reactivated a youth conference,
[827.90 → 831.34] a reformed youth conference that we've been doing for the last decade.
[831.48 → 836.08] It's once again being hosted by this church come September.
[836.26 → 839.70] So September 6, 7, 8, we'll have about 200 youth
[839.70 → 843.64] from anywhere between 10 and 15 churches in B.C.,
[843.64 → 845.64] possibly Alberta, possibly Washington,
[845.64 → 847.06] descending on this place.
[847.20 → 848.86] We're very excited about that.
[849.38 → 851.56] But in order for that conference,
[851.68 → 853.52] that three-day conference to run well,
[853.88 → 855.82] like last year, we need a lot of volunteers.
[856.36 → 860.10] And that volunteer sign-up is coming out this week.
[860.22 → 862.80] I'm not sure if it's going to be today or Tuesday,
[863.10 → 864.26] but keep your eyes open.
[864.42 → 865.24] It'll be coming out.
[865.80 → 867.06] There are lots of ways to serve.
[867.12 → 870.18] If you want to help prepare, clean up meals,
[870.66 → 871.86] help out with hosting,
[872.10 → 874.08] help out with parking or overnight security,
[874.08 → 877.02] we need people helping us move chairs around
[877.02 → 878.74] and setting up various canopies.
[879.12 → 882.32] We need some people to pick up stuff from turkeys
[882.32 → 884.80] or from Willoughby or from Buns Master.
[884.96 → 887.18] So that list will come out with all the opportunities,
[887.34 → 888.82] with all the times we need people.
[889.18 → 891.64] And I really, really, really invite you all
[891.64 → 894.92] to look at that list and find a place where you can help out.
[895.42 → 899.16] Last year, this church showed up in droves for this event,
[899.16 → 900.32] and it was so wonderful.
[900.32 → 902.16] So I do encourage you to take a look at that list
[902.16 → 904.02] and see how you can help out with that.
[904.30 → 906.36] I'm going to invite Aaron up front now with me.
[906.46 → 908.18] He's going to be the face of this next announcement
[908.18 → 911.60] because if I'm the face of announcements, nothing happens.
[911.90 → 913.82] But if Aaron's the face of announcements,
[914.40 → 916.06] we're going to get people, I think.
[916.58 → 918.12] Aaron, what's happening in July?
[919.66 → 920.26] Good morning.
[920.48 → 922.44] July 4th through the 7th,
[923.70 → 925.16] the I think I've said this before,
[925.16 → 928.22] but the Christian Reformed Church has a camp
[928.22 → 930.00] at Warren Beach Camp in Stanwood.
[931.22 → 934.92] I've been going for, since I was 12, about.
[935.32 → 936.88] So 30-some years.
[937.84 → 939.62] And when I was a kid,
[939.68 → 941.84] there was a lot of Canadians that showed up, a lot.
[942.78 → 945.92] And now there's not so many.
[946.76 → 948.24] And so I'd love, Kevin's going to be there.
[948.24 → 952.16] Kevin and Josh and Heather are all going to be there.
[952.68 → 954.26] And, oh, Mark.
[955.00 → 956.12] Oh, yeah.
[956.56 → 957.76] Margaret, yeah, yeah.
[958.08 → 959.18] Margaret's going to be there.
[959.44 → 960.34] Freddie will be there.
[961.24 → 962.60] Yeah, there's a lot of people.
[963.30 → 966.80] And there is July 4th through 7th.
[967.04 → 967.84] Registration's open.
[968.50 → 971.08] You can Google Cascade Family Bible Camp
[971.08 → 972.04] to find out about it.
[972.12 → 975.56] There's stuff for all ages from, you know,
[975.56 → 976.82] if you want to get rid of your kids,
[976.82 → 979.14] you could do that kind of here.
[979.70 → 983.40] And so from nursery all the way up to retired age,
[983.52 → 985.62] sports, games.
[987.16 → 991.14] Great speaker this year coming from Michigan, I think.
[992.32 → 992.94] Holland, Michigan.
[993.36 → 993.58] Yep.
[993.80 → 994.46] Thank you.
[995.10 → 996.56] I have to read the flyer better.
[997.92 → 999.64] And, yeah, if you have any questions,
[999.84 → 1003.46] my kids have always enjoyed it,
[1003.46 → 1004.64] even as they're growing older.
[1004.80 → 1006.06] One year we were going to the Netherlands.
[1006.82 → 1008.94] And they wanted to postpone their trip to the Netherlands
[1008.94 → 1011.44] so they could finish one more day of Worm Beach.
[1011.88 → 1013.24] And I said, we can't do that.
[1013.78 → 1016.34] And so, but Kevin's done a great job with the youth.
[1017.04 → 1019.94] And, yeah, if you have any questions, find me or Kevin.
[1020.84 → 1021.60] It's fun.
[1021.70 → 1023.72] If you can't come for the whole weekend, come for a day.
[1023.98 → 1024.86] Just show up for a day.
[1025.54 → 1026.02] It's fun.
[1026.02 → 1027.72] Anything else?
[1027.90 → 1028.48] Did I miss, Elise?
[1029.28 → 1029.60] Okay.
[1030.40 → 1031.06] It's fun.
[1031.94 → 1032.44] Thanks, Aaron.
[1032.48 → 1033.02] It is fun.
[1033.14 → 1033.70] Do come out.
[1033.82 → 1034.32] Take a look.
[1034.68 → 1035.96] It's a great time for sure.
[1036.60 → 1038.48] A couple quick hitter announcements.
[1038.70 → 1040.14] Today, youth, we've got youth coffee.
[1040.26 → 1042.02] After the service, it'll be at the Porter's House.
[1042.44 → 1043.68] Address is in your emails.
[1043.78 → 1044.34] Give that a look.
[1044.48 → 1045.20] That should be fun.
[1045.94 → 1048.16] This one's an interesting one.
[1048.48 → 1051.42] We are testing out a new closed loop sound system today.
[1051.80 → 1052.74] So that's happening.
[1052.82 → 1053.82] We're going to see how that works.
[1054.86 → 1056.82] There's a wire running on the floor here.
[1056.92 → 1059.72] This is one of those announcements that I feel a little bit silly saying.
[1059.92 → 1061.64] But there's a wire running on the floor here.
[1062.10 → 1063.42] Please don't pull the wire.
[1064.16 → 1065.28] Like, don't touch the wires.
[1065.42 → 1067.38] We have three rules in youth.
[1067.44 → 1068.52] Youth, what's rule number one?
[1068.58 → 1068.78] Anyone?
[1070.20 → 1071.10] Don't be dumb.
[1071.84 → 1074.20] This feels like that fits in that category.
[1074.20 → 1076.28] Okay, don't pull the wires.
[1076.40 → 1078.24] Hopefully, that closed loop system works well.
[1078.34 → 1079.46] We'll get that up and running soon.
[1079.78 → 1080.46] That will be good.
[1080.86 → 1087.62] Finally, in the middle of the service, we have an announcement on a presentation from Jennifer from Safe Families.
[1087.72 → 1092.44] So she's going to be introducing herself, doing a little presentation from Safe Families during the service,
[1092.48 → 1100.04] and then afterwards, having a bigger, probably more robust presentation out in the multipurpose room that we're all invited to join for that as well.
[1100.04 → 1104.02] So if that's something that you're interested or curious about, please come out after the service.
[1104.20 → 1105.18] And hear that as well.
[1105.32 → 1107.84] I'm going to invite Pastor Chris forward right now.
[1108.14 → 1111.36] He is going to lead us in God's greeting this morning.
[1115.78 → 1116.52] Thanks, Kevin.
[1116.78 → 1121.38] It is good to be with you all and in the presence of our God together.
[1121.38 → 1127.10] I'm going to invite you to stand as you're able and where you are, and we're going to be greeted by God.
[1127.24 → 1133.12] And then following God's greeting, we have the opportunity to share that greeting around as well.
[1133.60 → 1140.38] And you can do that by shaking hands, by nodding your head and just saying hello.
[1140.38 → 1143.04] You can do that by passing the peace of Christ.
[1143.64 → 1148.48] And so I encourage you, after receiving God's greeting, to greet those around you in our worship together.
[1149.14 → 1150.98] Receive the greeting of our God.
[1151.86 → 1158.94] Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, His Son, and our Saviour,
[1159.38 → 1161.82] through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[1163.04 → 1163.44] Amen.
[1163.44 → 1163.58] Amen.
[1165.58 → 1166.20] Good morning.
[1166.36 → 1166.90] Peace of Christ.
[1167.30 → 1168.10] Peace of Christ.
[1170.38 → 1200.36] Peace of Christ.
[1200.38 → 1215.64] Our call to worship this morning is coming to us from Psalm 108, where it says,
[1216.10 → 1218.48] My heart, O God, is steadfast.
[1218.78 → 1221.98] I will sing and make music with all my soul.
[1222.96 → 1224.56] Awake, harp and lyre.
[1224.88 → 1226.44] I will awaken the dawn.
[1226.44 → 1229.18] I will praise you, Lord, among the nations.
[1230.06 → 1232.46] I will sing of you among the peoples.
[1232.66 → 1235.78] For great is your love, higher than the heavens.
[1236.32 → 1238.80] Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.
[1239.70 → 1241.86] Be exalted, O God, above the heavens.
[1242.14 → 1244.50] Let your glory be over all the earth.
[1245.08 → 1248.26] Let's join our voices to sing with our whole soul,
[1248.44 → 1252.72] to sing of God's great love, a love that's higher than the heavens.
[1252.72 → 1263.10] 21 Idol
[1263.10 → 1263.46] done no 하나감이
[1263.46 → 1264.60] than the heavens.
[1264.60 → 1266.04] go be an hour
[1266.04 → 1267.06] number 215,
[1267.06 → 1272.24] There is an endless song
[1272.24 → 1282.24] Echoes in my soul, I hear the music ring.
[1282.24 → 1295.24] And though other storms may come, I am holding on to the rock I play.
[1295.24 → 1304.24] How can I keep from singing your praise?
[1304.24 → 1312.24] How can I ever say enough? How amazing is your love?
[1312.24 → 1318.24] How can I keep from shouting your name?
[1318.24 → 1333.24] I know I am loved by the King, and it makes my heart want to sing.
[1333.24 → 1347.24] I will lift my eyes in the darkest night, for I know my Saviour lives.
[1347.24 → 1362.24] And I will walk with you, knowing you'll see me through, and sing the songs you give.
[1362.24 → 1369.24] How can I keep from singing your praise?
[1369.24 → 1377.24] How can I ever say enough? How amazing is your love?
[1377.24 → 1383.24] How can I keep from shouting your name?
[1383.24 → 1394.24] I know I am loved by the King, and it makes my heart want to sing.
[1394.24 → 1409.12] I can sing in the troubled times, sing when I win. I can sing when I lose my step and fall down again.
[1409.12 → 1423.12] I can sing as you pick me up, sing as you're there. I can sing as you hear me, Lord, when I call to you in prayer.
[1423.12 → 1437.32] I can sing with my last breath. I can sing for I know that I'll sing when the angels and the saints are on the throne.
[1439.12 → 1459.02] How can I keep from singing your praise? How can I ever say enough? How amazing is your love? How can I keep from shouting your name?
[1459.02 → 1483.02] I know I am loved by the King, and it makes my heart want to sing.
[1483.02 → 1486.02] далеко
[1486.02 → 1516.00] Thank you.
[1516.02 → 1528.32] Jesus, hope of the nations, Jesus, comfort for all who mourn.
[1528.32 → 1533.70] You are the songs of heaven so honoured.
[1536.46 → 1544.60] Jesus, light in the darkness, Jesus, truth in each circumstance.
[1546.02 → 1552.02] You are the source of heaven's light on earth.
[1552.98 → 1557.14] In history you lived and died.
[1557.56 → 1562.02] You broke the chains you rose to life.
[1562.02 → 1592.02] 
[1592.02 → 1595.56] Living for all who will receive.
[1597.56 → 1600.02] Lord, we believe.
[1600.02 → 1617.02] Jesus, hope of the nations, Jesus, comfort for all who mourn.
[1617.02 → 1625.06] You are the source of heaven's hope on earth.
[1625.28 → 1633.74] Jesus, light in the darkness, Jesus, truth in each circumstance.
[1633.74 → 1640.74] You are the source of heaven's light on earth.
[1640.74 → 1645.96] In history you lived and died.
[1645.96 → 1651.90] You broke the chains you rose to life.
[1651.90 → 1656.02] You are the hope living in us.
[1656.02 → 1660.32] You are the rock in whom we trust.
[1660.96 → 1666.90] You are the light shining for all the world to see.
[1666.90 → 1673.10] You rose from the dead, conquering fear.
[1673.10 → 1677.42] Our prince of peace drawing us near.
[1677.42 → 1683.90] Jesus, our hope living for all who will receive.
[1683.90 → 1687.90] Lord, we believe.
[1687.90 → 1691.90] Lord, we believe.
[1691.90 → 1696.90] Lord, we believe.
[1696.90 → 1698.90] Lord, we believe.
[1698.90 → 1702.76] I invite you to be seated.
[1704.76 → 1707.58] Our confession today comes from Matthew 28.
[1707.58 → 1713.48] And surely I am with you always to the very end of the age.
[1714.40 → 1717.88] These are the last words of Jesus to his disciples.
[1718.30 → 1720.54] A promise we can take with us.
[1721.24 → 1723.10] I am with you always.
[1724.32 → 1728.10] I am with you even in your doubts, in your fears and failures.
[1728.80 → 1732.38] I am with you in the silence and in our questions.
[1733.14 → 1735.10] I am with you always.
[1735.10 → 1739.86] We are going to be singing My Lighthouse now.
[1739.86 → 1743.64] And I was wondering, I was at chapel on Friday.
[1743.64 → 1748.64] And, Linda, you did it to me too.
[1748.64 → 1750.64] Let's share.
[1750.64 → 1757.52] Anyway, I think chapel from grades like kindergarten to grade five,
[1757.52 → 1761.94] they did such an awesome job singing this song and doing the actions.
[1761.94 → 1765.24] And I was wondering if they could come up and help us with that song.
[1765.24 → 1770.74] Is there anybody willing to come up, show us like the clapping, the reverse?
[1770.74 → 1771.44] Oh, yes.
[1771.44 → 1772.94] Thank you so much.
[1772.94 → 1776.70] Anyone else want to come up and show us what it looks like?
[1776.70 → 1778.70] Right on.
[1778.70 → 1780.70] All right.
[1780.70 → 1784.28] Now that you're on the stage, I think we can stand and sing this song too.
[1784.28 → 1791.28] Thank you so much for coming up and helping.
[1791.28 → 1805.56] Feel free to join them in the actions.
[1805.56 → 1807.50] Here we go.
[1807.50 → 1808.50] Okay.
[1808.50 → 1809.50] Come on.
[1809.50 → 1818.12] In my wrestling and in my doubts, in my failures you won't walk out.
[1818.12 → 1822.70] Your great love will lead me through.
[1822.70 → 1827.32] You are the peace in my troubles.
[1827.32 → 1831.32] Oh, you are the peace in my troubles.
[1831.32 → 1835.32] Oh, you are the peace in my troubles.
[1835.32 → 1839.78] In the silence you won't let go.
[1839.78 → 1844.50] In the questions your truth will hold.
[1844.50 → 1848.82] Your great love will lead me through.
[1848.82 → 1853.44] You are the peace in my troubles.
[1853.44 → 1857.44] Oh, you are the peace in my troubles.
[1857.44 → 1861.44] In the darkness you won't follow you.
[1861.44 → 1866.44] My lighthouse, my lighthouse.
[1866.44 → 1870.44] Shining in the darkness I will follow you.
[1870.44 → 1875.44] Oh, my lighthouse, my lighthouse.
[1875.44 → 1877.44] You will carry me.
[1877.44 → 1883.06] You will carry me safe to shore.
[1883.06 → 1888.06] Safe to shore.
[1888.06 → 1892.06] Safe to shore.
[1892.06 → 1898.06] Safe to shore.
[1898.06 → 1902.68] I won't fear what tomorrow brings.
[1902.68 → 1906.68] With each morning I'll rise and sing.
[1906.68 → 1911.68] My God's love will lead me through.
[1911.68 → 1915.68] You are the peace in my troubled sea.
[1915.68 → 1923.68] Oh, you are the peace in my troubled sea.
[1923.68 → 1928.30] My lighthouse, my lighthouse.
[1928.30 → 1932.30] Shining in the darkness I will follow you.
[1932.30 → 1937.30] Oh, my lighthouse, my lighthouse.
[1937.30 → 1939.30] I will carry you.
[1939.30 → 1944.92] You will carry me safe to shore.
[1944.92 → 1949.92] Safe to shore.
[1949.92 → 1953.92] Safe to shore.
[1953.92 → 1957.92] Safe to shore.
[1957.92 → 1961.92] Fire before us.
[1961.92 → 1974.54] You will lead us through the storms.
[1974.54 → 1979.54] Fire before us.
[1979.54 → 1986.54] You will lead us through the storms.
[1986.54 → 1989.54] Fire before us.
[1989.54 → 1992.16] You are the brightest.
[1992.16 → 1995.16] You will lead us through the storm.
[1995.16 → 2000.16] My lighthouse, my lighthouse.
[2000.16 → 2004.16] Shining in the darkness I will follow you.
[2004.16 → 2009.16] Oh, my lighthouse, my lighthouse.
[2009.16 → 2011.16] I will trust the promise.
[2011.16 → 2016.78] You will carry me safe to shore.
[2016.78 → 2020.78] Safe to shore.
[2020.78 → 2025.78] Safe to shore.
[2025.78 → 2027.78] Safe to shore.
[2027.78 → 2030.78] Well, thank you so much.
[2030.78 → 2033.78] I'm glad to be seated.
[2033.78 → 2042.40] Thank you.
[2042.40 → 2046.60] Carrying on with that confession, Paul puts it so clearly in Romans 8.
[2046.60 → 2048.36] Romans 8, it says,
[2048.36 → 2054.12] For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither this present
[2054.12 → 2061.86] nor the future, nor any powers, neither heights nor depths nor anything else in all creation
[2061.86 → 2066.72] will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[2066.72 → 2075.84] If it reflects what we read in Matthew, I am with you always to the very end of the age.
[2075.84 → 2085.24] And yet in stressful times, it's easy to be overwhelmed and have circumstances blind us to God's love for us.
[2085.24 → 2086.62] Let's bow our heads.
[2086.62 → 2094.78] Father, you make it so clear.
[2094.78 → 2099.74] You tell us so plainly.
[2099.74 → 2104.74] I am with you always.
[2104.74 → 2109.54] Yet I hear myself asking, really?
[2109.54 → 2116.60] My failures won't separate me from your love?
[2116.60 → 2119.52] And we hear you through your words in Romans.
[2119.52 → 2121.08] Say that, yes, nothing.
[2121.78 → 2123.66] Nothing can separate us from your love.
[2125.48 → 2129.32] Help us to celebrate your ever-endearing love for us.
[2130.02 → 2133.92] Help us to know this deeply that you are always with us.
[2134.42 → 2136.08] That nothing can separate us.
[2136.94 → 2138.52] We need you, Lord Jesus.
[2139.00 → 2139.22] Amen.
[2139.22 → 2139.36] Amen.
[2144.36 → 2147.14] Why don't you rise as we sing this one?
[2147.14 → 2148.14] Amen.
[2148.14 → 2149.14] Amen.
[2149.14 → 2150.14] Amen.
[2150.14 → 2151.14] Amen.
[2151.14 → 2152.14] Amen.
[2152.14 → 2153.14] Amen.
[2153.14 → 2155.14] Amen.
[2155.14 → 2156.52] Lord, I come.
[2156.52 → 2159.94] I confess.
[2159.94 → 2169.00] Bowing here, I find my rest.
[2169.00 → 2174.92] And without you, I fall apart.
[2174.92 → 2183.76] You're the one that guides my heart.
[2183.76 → 2190.06] Lord, I need you.
[2190.06 → 2194.80] Oh, I need you.
[2194.80 → 2201.72] Every hour I need you.
[2201.72 → 2208.96] My one defence, my righteousness.
[2208.96 → 2214.78] Oh, God, how I need you.
[2214.78 → 2225.70] Where sin runs deep, your grace is more.
[2225.70 → 2232.70] Where grace is found is where you are.
[2232.70 → 2247.62] Holiness is Christ in me.
[2247.62 → 2254.54] And where you are, Lord, I am free.
[2254.54 → 2263.54] Holiness is Christ in me.
[2263.54 → 2266.46] Lord, I need you.
[2266.46 → 2268.46] Lord, I need you.
[2268.46 → 2273.46] Oh, I need you.
[2273.46 → 2280.46] Every hour I need you.
[2280.46 → 2287.38] My one defence, my righteousness.
[2287.38 → 2293.38] Oh, God, how I need you.
[2293.38 → 2306.30] Jesus, you're my hope and stay.
[2306.30 → 2311.22] And when I cannot stand, I'll fall on you.
[2311.22 → 2318.22] Jesus, you're my hope and stay.
[2318.22 → 2324.22] And when I cannot stand, I'll fall on you.
[2324.22 → 2330.14] Jesus, you're my hope and stay.
[2330.14 → 2335.14] Lord, I need you.
[2335.14 → 2337.00] Lord, I need you.
[2337.00 → 2341.14] Oh, I need you.
[2341.14 → 2348.34] Every hour I need you.
[2348.34 → 2355.26] My one defence, my righteousness.
[2355.26 → 2361.26] Oh, God, how I need you.
[2361.26 → 2364.26] I need you.
[2364.26 → 2369.26] Oh, I need you.
[2369.26 → 2376.26] Every hour I need you.
[2376.26 → 2383.18] My one defence, my righteousness.
[2383.18 → 2389.18] Oh, God, how I need you.
[2389.18 → 2397.18] My one defence, my righteousness.
[2397.18 → 2404.18] Oh, God, how I need you.
[2404.18 → 2407.10] I invite you to be seated.
[2407.10 → 2408.10] Thank you.
[2408.10 → 2409.10] Thank you.
[2409.10 → 2410.10] Thank you.
[2410.10 → 2411.10] Thank you.
[2411.10 → 2412.10] Thank you.
[2412.10 → 2414.10] Thank you.
[2414.10 → 2415.10] Thank you.
[2415.10 → 2416.10] Thank you.
[2416.10 → 2423.54] We've got a lot going on in our midst today and in this season of life for our church.
[2423.54 → 2432.06] And so at this point, we have the opportunity to install new office bearers for service here.
[2432.06 → 2438.98] We are grateful to God for his provision of our church leaders together.
[2438.98 → 2445.46] We want to thank Eric Van Heuser, who served as an admin elder and chair of council.
[2445.46 → 2448.86] We want to thank Daryl Wind, who served as a pastoral elder.
[2448.86 → 2455.66] And then also we thank Mike Rosa and Clem Molenkamp, who served this past season as deacons.
[2455.66 → 2462.14] In the office bearers of the church, we see Jesus' love for his people.
[2462.14 → 2470.90] Jesus appoints leaders to govern in his name, promoting the health and growth of the church and the maturation of our church family.
[2470.90 → 2480.58] Admin elders oversee the church in Jesus' name, dealing with the administration of our society and coordinating our governance with full council.
[2480.58 → 2487.94] Pastoral elders provide spiritual and theological leadership, giving pastoral guidance to those in need.
[2487.94 → 2494.52] And deacons lead us in serving the Lord through ministries of mercy and justice.
[2495.58 → 2505.64] Elders and deacons must be Christ-like, must be mature in faith, and they must exercise their offices with prayer, patience, and humility.
[2505.64 → 2515.28] Today, by the grace of God and in the Spirit's power, we ordain and install an admin elder, pastoral elder, and two deacons.
[2515.28 → 2518.70] And so when I call your name, I'm going to invite you to come to the front.
[2519.64 → 2523.64] Clary will be serving and installed as an admin elder.
[2524.22 → 2527.10] Paul will be installed as a pastoral elder.
[2527.84 → 2532.36] And Allison and Pearl will be installed as deacons in our midst.
[2532.36 → 2537.24] Yeah, right up, right on stage.
[2548.42 → 2550.84] Order doesn't matter as much when you're up here.
[2550.90 → 2551.40] You're up here.
[2553.62 → 2559.98] To affirm your acceptance of these responsibilities, I'm going to ask you four questions.
[2559.98 → 2563.56] So I'll ask all four questions, and then I'll ask, say, Clary, what is your answer?
[2563.90 → 2572.14] Invite you to respond, saying, I do with God's help, or I do God helping me, or I do with Jesus, however you choose to respond.
[2574.62 → 2582.98] First, do you believe that in the call of this congregation, God himself is calling you to these holy offices?
[2582.98 → 2590.72] Second, do you believe that the Old and New Testaments are the word of God, the only infallible rule of faith and life?
[2591.80 → 2597.50] Three, do you subscribe to the doctrinal standards of this church, rejecting all teaching which contradicts them?
[2598.18 → 2603.36] And four, do you promise to do the work of your offices faithfully in a way worthy of your calling,
[2603.78 → 2607.96] and in submission to the government and discipleship of this church?
[2608.88 → 2610.36] Clary, what is your answer?
[2610.36 → 2611.78] I do, God helping me.
[2611.90 → 2612.14] Amen.
[2612.38 → 2613.48] Paul, what is your answer?
[2613.72 → 2614.74] I do, God helping me.
[2614.80 → 2615.10] Amen.
[2615.36 → 2616.46] Allison, what is your answer?
[2616.74 → 2617.70] I do, God helping me.
[2617.76 → 2618.00] Amen.
[2618.24 → 2619.52] And Pearl, what is your answer?
[2619.76 → 2620.92] I do, God helping me.
[2621.06 → 2621.42] Amen.
[2622.04 → 2622.40] Amen.
[2623.68 → 2626.90] We're going to ordain them with a prayer.
[2627.28 → 2630.08] And to do that, what I'd like you to do is just to move down here,
[2630.18 → 2634.74] and then I'm going to invite the outgoing office bearers, the currently serving office bearers,
[2634.74 → 2639.64] and then the family of those, these people here who will serve together,
[2640.32 → 2645.16] as well anyone else who feels led to come forward and to lay hands on.
[2646.00 → 2648.78] If you aren't wanting to come forward to lay hands on,
[2648.78 → 2656.64] you are invited just to hold a hand up and out as a gesture and a symbol of our laying hands on here.
[2656.64 → 2670.74] In the scriptures, the laying on of hands is a picture of God's Holy Spirit at work
[2670.74 → 2678.14] through the body of believers, commissioning these people, sending these people to serve in our midst.
[2678.66 → 2683.10] And so we offer this prayer of ordination and commissioning.
[2683.24 → 2684.62] Join your heart with me in prayer.
[2686.64 → 2691.92] God, our Heavenly Father, who has called you to these sacred offices,
[2692.44 → 2697.34] guide you by his word, equip you with his spirit, and prosper your ministries.
[2698.20 → 2701.62] Lord Jesus, make them faithful workers in your vineyard.
[2702.74 → 2708.46] Under their guidance, may your church grow in spiritual grace, faith, and committed service.
[2709.18 → 2712.94] Help them perform their duties with enthusiasm and humility.
[2712.94 → 2718.24] Grant in them sustained awe rooted in daily adoration of you.
[2719.22 → 2723.14] Through them, may your name be honoured, and your church be served.
[2724.54 → 2728.74] And help us, we pray, your people, to accept them gladly,
[2729.30 → 2734.30] to encourage them, and to respect them for the sake of your Son, our Lord,
[2734.40 → 2735.66] in whose name we pray.
[2736.16 → 2738.32] All God's people said, Amen.
[2739.40 → 2739.72] Amen.
[2739.72 → 2742.14] You may all take your seat together.
[2751.64 → 2759.00] For this next portion, I'm going to read the charge that comes from the Scriptures
[2759.00 → 2762.32] to those who are serving in these offices.
[2762.32 → 2768.06] And so, even as I address you by name, as you've just been installed and ordained,
[2768.48 → 2773.46] this applies to all of us who serve as elders and deacons in this church.
[2774.12 → 2775.52] And so, Clary, first.
[2775.52 → 2780.48] As admin elder, I charge you with these scriptures to guide your work.
[2781.60 → 2787.14] Hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught so that you can encourage others.
[2788.30 → 2790.52] Pray continually for the church.
[2791.48 → 2796.90] And remember that true spiritual leadership requires being mastered by your Lord.
[2796.90 → 2801.08] Everything must be done so that the church may be built up.
[2801.92 → 2806.30] Ensure that everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way.
[2807.66 → 2809.78] And Paul, where did you go?
[2809.86 → 2810.28] There you are.
[2810.54 → 2815.82] Paul, as a pastoral elder, I charge you with these scriptures to guide your work.
[2816.78 → 2819.94] Hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught,
[2820.04 → 2825.34] so that you may encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it.
[2825.34 → 2828.50] Pray continually for the church.
[2829.46 → 2831.02] Remember, our Lord Jesus said,
[2831.36 → 2835.34] Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me,
[2835.70 → 2839.40] and so be a friend and Christ-like example to children.
[2840.28 → 2843.08] Give clear and cheerful guidance to young people.
[2843.86 → 2849.96] Know the scriptures which are useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness.
[2850.80 → 2854.50] And remember at all times that if you would truly give spiritual leadership
[2854.50 → 2859.28] in the household of faith, you must be completely mastered by your Lord.
[2860.54 → 2867.06] And Allison and Pearl, to you, I charge you with these scriptures to guide your work as deacons.
[2867.86 → 2871.98] Hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught,
[2872.06 → 2874.70] so that you can encourage others.
[2874.70 → 2878.94] You are to be worthy of respect and sincere.
[2879.70 → 2883.56] Deacons must keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience.
[2884.40 → 2887.50] And so serve the church with the spirit and wisdom.
[2888.04 → 2894.32] And teach us to act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with our God.
[2894.32 → 2899.50] And then to the congregation, to the church family gathered here at Emmanuel,
[2899.88 → 2907.06] I charge you, people of God, to receive these office bearers as Christ's gift to the church.
[2908.24 → 2912.60] Recognize in them the Lord's provision for a healthy congregational life.
[2913.10 → 2914.10] Hold them in honour.
[2914.30 → 2915.84] Take their counsel seriously.
[2916.32 → 2918.42] Respond with obedience and respect.
[2918.80 → 2920.80] And accept their help with thanks.
[2920.80 → 2925.02] Participate wholeheartedly in the ministries they lead.
[2925.38 → 2929.96] Sustain them in prayer and support them, especially when they feel burdened.
[2930.86 → 2934.64] And acknowledge them as the Lord's servants among you.
[2936.14 → 2939.94] And so you, congregation, family of God, have a question as well.
[2940.22 → 2942.32] And I invite you to respond as you see.
[2942.32 → 2947.64] Do you, congregation, pledge to receive them as you have been charged?
[2948.32 → 2950.50] We do with God's help.
[2951.42 → 2951.78] Amen.
[2952.38 → 2954.22] Let's continue in our worship with the offering.
[2954.40 → 2956.26] I'll invite the deacons forward to lead us in that.
[2956.26 → 2956.44] Amen.
[2965.12 → 2965.94] Was that better?
[2966.14 → 2966.62] Sound wise?
[2966.84 → 2967.30] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2967.30 → 2967.48] Okay.
[2972.14 → 2972.78] Good morning.
[2973.00 → 2975.22] My name is Brenda, and I'm a deacon here at Emmanuel.
[2975.22 → 2979.30] We continue our worship with the giving of our gifts, first to the budget.
[2980.04 → 2983.04] And our special offering today is for benevolence.
[2984.54 → 2998.24] And as a congregation here, every Sunday you get to see one of us deacons come up here and tell you about the cause, the organization, the mission or ministry that you are giving to.
[2998.24 → 3002.78] And all of those typically have a name to it.
[3003.70 → 3006.80] We have Jennifer here today from Safe Families.
[3006.96 → 3008.00] She's going to talk to us.
[3008.46 → 3016.84] We have the baby bottle campaign going on, which this is just a reminder that if you haven't gotten your baby bottle from the back yet, you can still take one.
[3016.84 → 3020.86] But all of those have names to them.
[3021.80 → 3024.60] Our offering for today is for benevolence.
[3025.30 → 3032.42] Benevolence is a term that for me, having grown up in the Christian Reformed Church, I've heard this term, I guess, all my life.
[3033.38 → 3036.04] Kind of knew what it was, that sort of thing.
[3036.04 → 3046.00] But these last two years for me as serving as a deacon have really showed to me that benevolence also has, it's maybe more generic, but it also has a name.
[3046.84 → 3056.46] It's names and faces of people that most of us don't get to meet, people who are struggling, people, whether it's in this congregation, whether it's in our local community.
[3056.46 → 3071.40] But we have the privilege and the ability, this church has been incredibly generous, to support these people, these situations that come up, maybe one time, maybe ongoing.
[3072.44 → 3084.20] So today I just ask that you consider, yes, it's a title, it's a benevolence, but there are names and faces and building of relationships that happen through the giving that you give.
[3084.20 → 3087.86] So I ask that you bless as God has blessed you.
[3114.20 → 3136.46] Jesus, Jesus, be the centre, be my source, be my light, Jesus.
[3136.46 → 3136.50] Jesus, be the centre, be my source, be my light, Jesus.
[3136.50 → 3166.48] Jesus, be my source, be my source, Jesus.
[3166.48 → 3185.98] Jesus, be the fire in my heart, be the wind in these sails, be the reason that I live, Jesus.
[3185.98 → 3189.04] Jesus, Jesus.
[3189.04 → 3196.04] Jesus, Jesus.
[3196.48 → 3211.48] Jesus, be my source, be my source, be my source, be my source, be my source, and be the Lord.
[3211.48 → 3213.88] Jesus, Jesus.
[3217.88 → 3225.92] Be the fire in my heart, be the wind in these sails, be the light, Jesus.
[3225.92 → 3236.16] In these cells be the reason that I live
[3236.16 → 3241.08] Jesus, Jesus
[3241.08 → 3255.34] Jesus, be the centre
[3255.34 → 3263.34] Be my source, be my light
[3263.98 → 3266.18] Jesus
[3266.18 → 3269.34] Jesus
[3269.34 → 3282.50] Okay, I'd like to invite all the kids age 3 to grade 4.
[3282.58 → 3283.66] We've got some keeners here.
[3285.34 → 3291.98] Did you say the girls are always first?
[3293.10 → 3293.54] Okay.
[3293.80 → 3294.80] Did boys, did you hear that?
[3296.00 → 3296.52] Alright.
[3297.52 → 3298.24] Good morning.
[3298.30 → 3299.12] How's everybody doing?
[3299.64 → 3300.02] Good.
[3300.02 → 3301.42] Right on.
[3301.58 → 3306.42] Today or the last couple of weeks we've been talking a bit about family and children's worship time.
[3306.48 → 3307.20] Do you remember that?
[3308.08 → 3309.38] Now what does family mean?
[3309.44 → 3312.28] Does family mean just like the people in your home?
[3312.48 → 3315.40] Or is it mean, is there greater family around?
[3315.66 → 3316.88] Yeah, what does family mean to you?
[3316.88 → 3317.42] Okay.
[3317.42 → 3317.48] Okay.
[3317.48 → 3325.30] When you have family, it's like sometimes we talk about family.
[3325.30 → 3326.68] That's the people in our home.
[3326.76 → 3330.24] But family, like everybody here in this church is kind of part of your family, aren't they?
[3330.38 → 3330.62] Yeah.
[3331.18 → 3332.64] So I got a question for you.
[3332.70 → 3336.74] When you go and meet somebody else, what's the best way to meet somebody?
[3336.80 → 3338.72] Like on the playground or at the park or something?
[3338.74 → 3339.34] What do you get to do?
[3339.96 → 3340.68] Shake hands.
[3340.74 → 3341.38] What's something else?
[3342.38 → 3343.12] Introduce yourself.
[3343.22 → 3343.58] What else?
[3344.46 → 3345.30] Say hi.
[3345.30 → 3345.36] Hi.
[3346.20 → 3349.52] So sometimes when you want to meet somebody new, you ask questions.
[3349.74 → 3352.78] So it might be like, and I don't, I know some of you guys pretty good.
[3352.84 → 3356.38] But if I ask you a question like, what's your favourite colour?
[3357.60 → 3358.00] Purple.
[3358.16 → 3359.58] So I know something new about you.
[3360.06 → 3360.88] How about you?
[3360.94 → 3362.06] Do you guys have a pet at home?
[3362.48 → 3363.56] What kind of pet do you have?
[3364.50 → 3365.46] You have a dog.
[3365.76 → 3366.18] Okay.
[3366.94 → 3369.90] And do you like candy?
[3370.68 → 3373.16] Oh, I learned all kinds of new things about some people.
[3373.16 → 3376.98] So as I learn new things about people, it's easier for you.
[3377.08 → 3380.96] You can be part of my friend group, and I can share God's love with you because I have
[3380.96 → 3382.04] a relationship with you.
[3382.14 → 3384.70] So that's what we're going to learn about today in children's worship time.
[3384.76 → 3385.72] Does that sound like a good idea?
[3386.08 → 3386.30] Yes.
[3387.06 → 3390.14] How about we stand up right now, and we'll bless the congregation.
[3391.62 → 3392.92] And they'll bless us.
[3393.56 → 3393.82] Ready?
[3394.90 → 3397.30] The Lord be with you.
[3397.30 → 3399.30] And also with you.
[3403.16 → 3419.00] Hi.
[3419.12 → 3423.44] My name is Jennifer Remake, and this is really like coming home.
[3423.44 → 3429.54] I used to teach next door, and I'm running into some of my students who now have families
[3429.54 → 3431.80] of their own, and that makes me feel a little bit old.
[3432.38 → 3434.06] But great to see everybody.
[3434.34 → 3435.72] So my name is Jennifer Remake.
[3435.84 → 3438.86] I'm the chapter director of Safe Families Lower Mainland.
[3439.08 → 3442.46] We currently serve families from Chilliwack to Coverdale.
[3442.46 → 3450.48] And what we do is we try, and our motto is to keep kids safe and families together through
[3450.48 → 3453.34] community, through a circle of support.
[3453.78 → 3456.84] And our motto is that everyone can do something.
[3457.36 → 3462.14] And all the little something's add up to a huge difference.
[3462.80 → 3468.10] The reason I can be so passionate about this cause is I'm standing here before you today
[3468.10 → 3473.94] because someone, when crisis struck my family, someone from the church reached out, and my
[3473.94 → 3475.44] life has never been the same.
[3476.44 → 3481.64] My dad left when I was three, and not only did he leave me and my mom, but he left my mom
[3481.64 → 3483.24] who had a degenerative disease.
[3483.72 → 3484.74] She didn't drive.
[3484.94 → 3488.26] I was three, four, five, having to care for her.
[3488.80 → 3490.88] I should have been put into foster care.
[3491.30 → 3496.06] But the reason I wasn't put into foster care was because one person from the church came
[3496.06 → 3499.74] to my family in crisis, and that began a relationship.
[3500.40 → 3503.52] And someone every week drove us to get groceries on a Saturday.
[3504.10 → 3505.82] Somebody paid for me to go to camp.
[3506.24 → 3508.78] Somebody hosted me while my mom was in the hospital.
[3509.14 → 3514.70] All these little pieces allowed me to be here today knowing Christ.
[3514.84 → 3515.96] My mom found Christ.
[3516.08 → 3517.06] I found Christ.
[3517.48 → 3521.48] My kids, it didn't only change my life, but it changed generations to follow.
[3521.48 → 3527.38] And so that's why I can stand here so passionate about safe families, because in the church,
[3527.44 → 3529.22] we know what community is.
[3529.80 → 3535.94] But since starting this job, I'm telling you honestly, people have no one.
[3536.64 → 3541.34] One example would be a single mom with two kids, and she was going in for a C-section.
[3541.82 → 3547.72] She was taking a cab to the hospital to have her baby, and she had nowhere for her two kids
[3547.72 → 3548.20] to go.
[3548.82 → 3551.52] So we were, you're thinking, can you call a neighbour?
[3551.68 → 3552.60] Can you call your mom?
[3552.72 → 3553.66] Can you call a sister?
[3554.10 → 3555.14] They have nobody.
[3555.78 → 3560.10] Safe Families was able to host her two children for five days while the mom could go in.
[3560.44 → 3563.46] We paired her with a family friend who drove her to the hospital.
[3563.96 → 3565.84] Part of the church created a meal train.
[3566.00 → 3567.56] Somebody came in and cleaned her house.
[3567.56 → 3574.96] We supported them in temporary crisis so that the family doesn't fall apart.
[3574.96 → 3580.38] So we try and keep kids and families together through support, through the church.
[3581.32 → 3582.92] All of us can do something.
[3583.08 → 3585.38] We have volunteers that are 18 years old.
[3585.48 → 3587.10] We have volunteers who are 82.
[3587.90 → 3593.88] We have a wonderful 82-year-old man that delivers groceries to three single moms every single week.
[3594.04 → 3595.88] He's like, this is my greatest joy.
[3596.04 → 3597.78] He goes, this is not a chore for me.
[3598.28 → 3602.58] We have a 25-year-old plumber that I did a presentation at a young adults group.
[3602.58 → 3606.46] And he's like, well, I can't really do much, but I'm a plumber.
[3606.52 → 3607.42] Would that be useful?
[3607.94 → 3609.56] I'm like, that would be very useful.
[3609.94 → 3611.46] Two weeks ago, we had a single mom.
[3611.52 → 3615.40] Her dishwasher broke, flooded the kitchen.
[3615.60 → 3619.18] He went there, fixed it, mopped the floor, was playing with the kids.
[3619.26 → 3624.56] He's like, I sure hope some more dishwashers break because that was really, really a blessing to me.
[3624.56 → 3630.98] And so if you think of your worst crisis that you've been in and think who came around you,
[3631.54 → 3635.06] but then think of that crisis in having no one coming around you.
[3635.58 → 3638.64] That's what our families, the place that they're in right now.
[3638.84 → 3641.22] So we have four different volunteer roles.
[3641.36 → 3642.76] So everyone can do something.
[3642.92 → 3644.60] Some are hosting kids temporarily.
[3645.22 → 3646.58] Some are a family friend.
[3647.04 → 3650.16] Some help supply resources like boots or diapers.
[3650.68 → 3652.36] And some are family coaches.
[3652.36 → 3655.80] And so I would love for you to come and hear more of my story,
[3656.04 → 3660.32] more of Safe Families, and how we're impacting the community.
[3660.74 → 3664.16] The biggest thing that I find with our families is they come, and they say,
[3664.52 → 3666.28] why are you doing this?
[3667.46 → 3668.74] Nobody is getting paid.
[3668.88 → 3674.92] They cannot wrap their head around why people are building relationship and friendship with them.
[3675.58 → 3679.44] It gives us the opportunity to say why we're doing this.
[3679.60 → 3681.06] Christ loved us first.
[3681.06 → 3684.02] And where are they going to find true hope and healing?
[3684.50 → 3686.08] Is through Christ Jesus.
[3686.40 → 3688.96] And so this has been a wonderful opportunity.
[3690.02 → 3691.72] I gave up my teaching job.
[3691.90 → 3694.28] I taught for most of my life.
[3694.48 → 3697.76] I really felt like God was bringing about something different.
[3697.92 → 3700.28] So I resigned not knowing what I was going to do.
[3700.64 → 3703.16] My husband and I were looking into doing foster care.
[3703.78 → 3705.98] Somebody posted about Safe Families.
[3706.12 → 3707.88] I said, Jeff, this is what we need to do.
[3707.88 → 3709.68] We want to keep families together.
[3710.18 → 3713.68] We want these kids going into Christian-loving, safe homes.
[3713.98 → 3718.72] I'll tell you countless stories in the presentation of families right here in Langley,
[3718.94 → 3725.56] where their lives have been absolutely changed by friendship and community and feeling like they're not alone.
[3725.56 → 3731.66] It's when kids and families are isolated and withdrawn is often when kids become unsafe.
[3732.00 → 3735.30] This is not necessarily parents who are poor parents.
[3735.42 → 3736.94] They're parents without support.
[3737.48 → 3741.00] And so I would love for you to come and hear more about Safe Families Lower Mainland.
[3741.00 → 3743.62] It's been great to see all of you.
[3744.02 → 3746.52] We'll be in the back room there after the service.
[3746.90 → 3747.34] Thank you.
[3747.34 → 3763.22] Thank you, Jennifer.
[3763.34 → 3764.14] That was good to hear.
[3764.94 → 3765.98] My name is Dave.
[3766.10 → 3767.70] I am one of the elders in this church.
[3768.22 → 3772.72] And it is my blessing to be able to lead you in our church family prayer.
[3773.32 → 3774.00] Let us pray.
[3774.00 → 3778.32] Father, this is the day that you have made.
[3778.70 → 3780.64] We rejoice, and we are glad in it.
[3781.36 → 3784.04] Father, we praise you, and thank you for this Lord's Day,
[3784.28 → 3787.96] a time when we gather with Christians everywhere, and we celebrate your name.
[3788.94 → 3793.76] Father, we confess that we are flawed human beings and we have a sinful nature.
[3794.52 → 3799.20] Like the Apostle Paul, we desire to do what is good and cannot carry it out.
[3799.20 → 3805.54] We do not do the good we want to do, but the evil we do not want to do, this we keep on doing.
[3805.54 → 3814.20] We thank you that we do not have to bear the guilt of our sin, for Jesus has taken our burden to the cross, and we don't have to bear it anymore.
[3814.60 → 3816.82] We thank you for that unspeakable gift.
[3816.82 → 3822.36] Father, we thank you for this special Sunday where we get to install new office bearers.
[3822.74 → 3829.70] We thank you for new elders and deacons and the important work that they do, the governance of this congregation and service for your people.
[3830.42 → 3833.62] Give them guidance and strength as they do this important work.
[3834.04 → 3837.08] We promise them our love, encouragement and prayers.
[3837.08 → 3840.52] We thank you for the synod that we'll be meeting soon.
[3840.98 → 3844.88] We thank you that Pastor Chris has the opportunity to serve as a delegate at that synod.
[3845.30 → 3847.76] We pray for him and every other delegate.
[3848.30 → 3851.24] They have important and sometimes difficult matters to discuss.
[3851.90 → 3859.22] Give them wisdom, understanding and insight so that they might be able to discern your will for your church and act accordingly.
[3859.22 → 3867.36] Father, we thank you for Safe Families Canada and the important work that they are doing.
[3868.12 → 3875.20] And maybe they're just doing volunteer work in small ways, but they are in situations where people are in need.
[3875.46 → 3877.06] We thank you for the work that they do.
[3877.40 → 3879.32] We ask that you will continue to bless them.
[3880.06 → 3884.60] We think about members of our congregation and people connected to it.
[3884.60 → 3889.78] We thank you that Kobe DeBoer-Sap has had a bone marrow transplant and is continuing
[3889.78 → 3893.08] radiation chemotherapy.
[3893.08 → 3895.14] This is a difficult treatment to get.
[3895.14 → 3898.04] We pray for strength and for healing.
[3898.04 → 3904.32] Father, we thank you Everly Astra who has been diagnosed with melanoma.
[3904.32 → 3908.36] We are grateful that the prognosis is helpful, but we know that there is lots of work that
[3908.36 → 3909.54] needs to be done.
[3909.54 → 3913.80] Please be with her and family as they endure this challenge as well.
[3913.80 → 3918.70] We pray for Rose Vita who has experienced her own health challenges and other struggles.
[3918.70 → 3923.18] We pray that you be very close to her and give her what she stands in need of.
[3923.18 → 3929.10] We think about Judy Dijkstra's friend Vera who has been experiencing shingles for some time.
[3929.10 → 3930.74] This is a very painful condition.
[3930.74 → 3935.34] We pray that she will experience some relief.
[3935.34 → 3939.12] At the end of this school year we pray for the students and teachers at Langley Christian
[3939.12 → 3941.56] School and all other schools.
[3941.56 → 3946.46] We pray that they will be able to finish well and look forward to a summer break.
[3946.46 → 3950.66] Whether it be travel or rest or work or spending time with family.
[3950.66 → 3952.94] We ask that you bless this time for them.
[3952.94 → 3957.38] Father, we thank you about the severe floods that have taken place in southern Brazil with
[3957.38 → 3960.26] widespread damage and loss of life.
[3960.26 → 3964.96] We pray that national and international efforts will be able to come together and to help all
[3964.96 → 3969.36] those who have been injured, to help those who have been displaced.
[3969.36 → 3974.72] Father, once again we pray for the war zones of the world.
[3974.72 → 3976.46] We think about Israel and Gaza.
[3976.46 → 3978.92] We think about Ukraine and Russia.
[3978.92 → 3983.04] We know that there are other places that are experiencing tension and conflict.
[3983.04 → 3986.82] We pray for those who are suffering and those who are living in fear.
[3986.82 → 3992.92] We pray for the injured, for the families of the dead, for the families of the hostages.
[3992.92 → 3996.54] We pray for a real peace, a meaningful peace.
[3996.54 → 4003.32] Not just one where the shooting stops, but where everyone learns to live together as neighbours.
[4003.32 → 4006.70] We pray for Pastor Chris as he leads us in your word.
[4006.70 → 4011.58] We pray that our study, we value our study of Paul's letter to the Romans.
[4011.58 → 4017.82] It gives us valuable insights on our sin, your love, your grace, and faith in you.
[4017.82 → 4023.06] Give Chris the words so that we can listen and apply them to the rest of our lives, so
[4023.06 → 4027.66] that all the Gentiles may come to the obedience that comes from faith.
[4027.66 → 4032.56] To the only wise God be glory forever through Jesus Christ.
[4032.56 → 4032.86] Amen.
[4035.32 → 4058.32] As Dave prayed there, we are going to continue in our look through the book of Romans.
[4059.00 → 4066.14] We are coming near the end this week and next, and we have made it all the way through from
[4066.14 → 4076.26] beginning to end. It will be almost exactly 18 months since we started in Romans, and so a
[4076.26 → 4084.04] testament to you and your endurance in this work together. We're going to read today from Romans 16
[4084.04 → 4093.10] starting at verse 17, and then I'll read through to the end of verse 23. It will be on the screen
[4093.10 → 4098.68] behind me as we go through the first time, but I encourage you, if you have a Bible or a Bible app,
[4098.82 → 4104.98] to have that open and keep that open as we will, of course, be digging in and going through in
[4104.98 → 4109.00] particular. Hear the words of Paul.
[4109.00 → 4119.50] I urge you, brothers and sisters, to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles
[4119.50 → 4127.14] in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned. Keep away from them, for such people
[4127.14 → 4135.62] are not serving our Lord, but their own appetites. By smooth talk and flattery, they deceive the minds
[4135.62 → 4143.14] of naive people. Everyone has heard about your obedience, so I rejoice because of you, but I want
[4143.14 → 4151.94] you to be wise about what is good and innocent about what is evil. The God of peace will soon crush Satan
[4151.94 → 4162.20] under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you. Timothy, my co-worker, sends his greetings to you,
[4162.20 → 4171.54] as do Lucius, Jason, and Antipater, my fellow Jews. I, Terminus, who wrote down this letter, greet you in the
[4171.54 → 4179.70] Lord. Gaius, whose hospitality I and the whole church here enjoy, sends you his greetings.
[4181.52 → 4188.58] Erastus, who is the city's director of public works, and our brother Quarts send you their greetings.
[4188.58 → 4202.80] This is the word of the Lord. I want to just jump right in for us together this morning,
[4202.80 → 4213.68] to not beat around the bush, to ensure that we hear and that we don't miss
[4213.68 → 4223.60] precisely what it is that Paul is telling us to watch out for. Simply put, Paul says,
[4224.06 → 4229.90] watch out for those who would rob you of the power of the gospel.
[4233.66 → 4238.34] Watch out for those who would offer you something else. Watch out for those who would offer you
[4238.34 → 4243.48] something less. Watch out for those who would offer you something that sounds great on the surface,
[4243.48 → 4250.32] but in the end proves hollow. Watch out for those who would seek to divide you and to break you apart.
[4250.78 → 4256.54] Watch out for those who would rob you of the power of the gospel.
[4256.54 → 4269.16] Now, if you look at the whole of chapter 16, this little seeming interruption, this interlude in
[4269.16 → 4277.70] verse 17 through 20 seems a little bit strange, right? In the first part of the chapter, and we
[4277.70 → 4283.76] looked at this last week, there's a list of people that Paul ministered with and who are probably known
[4283.76 → 4290.98] to the church in Rome. And then verse 21 continues with Paul's missionary team with another list of
[4290.98 → 4301.94] people. Now, it's important to see here that Paul wrote this letter sometime around the sort of mid-AD
[4301.94 → 4310.38] 50s, sometime between like 55 and 58. Some scholars narrow that down to 57 to 58. And he's staying
[4310.38 → 4318.36] in Corinth before making his trip to Jerusalem. In fact, he's staying, we read it, in Gaius's house,
[4319.12 → 4326.24] right? Verse 23, Gaius, whose hospitality and I, the whole church, enjoy. 1 Corinthians 1 verse 14
[4326.24 → 4333.66] mentions that Paul baptized Gaius, probably on his second missionary journey when he stayed there in
[4333.66 → 4338.82] Corinth for a year and a half with Priscilla and Aquila, two other leaders in the Corinthian church
[4338.82 → 4346.36] who came from Rome and who are mentioned in the first half of this chapter. But now, Paul is on his
[4346.36 → 4352.14] third missionary journey, and he's getting ready to head back from Jerusalem, and he spends three months
[4352.14 → 4360.70] or so living in Gaius's house. You can read about this in the book of Acts. And he tells us, continuing his
[4360.70 → 4369.46] list, that Timothy is there with him and that Timothy is a co-worker with Paul. Now, Paul met Timothy in a
[4369.46 → 4375.88] city called Lustra on his second missionary journey. And Paul and Timothy have had a special relationship
[4375.88 → 4384.36] from the beginning. Paul refers to Timothy as my true son in the faith. He calls him his deeply loved son.
[4384.36 → 4392.32] In Philippians, we can read that Paul says, Timothy serves with him as a son with a father in the work of the
[4392.32 → 4400.70] gospel. And so, Paul and Timothy are together, and they are close, and they work in this. And Timothy is a
[4400.70 → 4407.58] recurring character in the story of Paul and the missionary work of Paul. He adds more names. He lists
[4407.58 → 4416.08] Lucius, Jason, and Antipater. Jason may be referred to, may refer to the person that Paul stayed with
[4416.08 → 4421.82] in Thessaloniki, which is the city he was in before coming to Corinth on this time around, but we can't
[4421.82 → 4429.86] guarantee that. And then, continuing the list in verse 22, we meet a man named Persian who wrote down
[4429.86 → 4437.68] this letter. Now, it's common practice for writers and authors of the day to use trained or professional
[4437.68 → 4444.88] writers. So, the apostle Paul is the author and then Persian is the writer of this letter.
[4446.42 → 4455.72] And then lastly, right, we hear a greeting from Erastus and Corpus. And Erastus is listed as the
[4455.72 → 4462.62] director of public works. Now, I think this is amazing, but I geek out on these kinds of things.
[4463.42 → 4473.94] In the early 1920s, and then again in the 1960s, a plaque was found in the ancient ruins of the city
[4473.94 → 4481.96] of Corinth. It dates to the first century, so the time of Paul to this very time. And on it is the name
[4481.96 → 4490.92] Erastus. And there's an inscription that's carved there that says he was a city official who used
[4490.92 → 4500.30] his wealth to pave a road in the city of Corinth. So, he used his own wealth and his own public station
[4500.30 → 4507.04] to serve the community. And this is recorded in stone, literally. And this is another example,
[4507.04 → 4513.88] I think, of evidence from archaeology confirming the truth and the historicity of the Bible and what
[4513.88 → 4523.50] Paul is writing about here. Now, all of these names are cool. All of these stories are fascinating to
[4523.50 → 4536.72] think on. But for us this morning, I want to focus instead on Paul's one last urging.
[4537.04 → 4545.04] He says, I urge you, brothers and sisters, to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles
[4545.04 → 4549.12] in your way that are contrary to the teaching that you have learned.
[4551.24 → 4559.62] Now, the Apostle Paul is very familiar with people and with groups of people who come after him,
[4559.92 → 4565.48] that is, who come to a place after he has established a church there, or after he has taught and spent time
[4565.48 → 4571.72] there. A group of people come and follow after him. And it seems like, as we read the history of it,
[4571.76 → 4577.02] there's an intentionality to it in that they wait for him to leave and then they follow in.
[4577.36 → 4585.40] And they teach contrary to what he has taught. And this is a situation, for example, in the church
[4585.40 → 4591.60] of Galatia. Right? In the book of Galatians, Paul says very pointedly, he says,
[4591.60 → 4597.14] I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you to live in the grace of
[4597.14 → 4603.72] Christ and are turning to a different gospel, which is really no gospel at all. Evidently,
[4603.80 → 4609.30] some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ.
[4609.30 → 4616.96] And to this group of people, right, who are causing divisions and putting obstacles in the way,
[4617.04 → 4622.60] to this group of people in Galatia, he pulls no punches, and he calls them foolish, and he says that
[4622.60 → 4629.62] they have been bewitched. In the same way, actually, Paul warns Timothy when he says,
[4630.62 → 4636.96] for a time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own
[4636.96 → 4642.24] desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears
[4642.24 → 4648.72] want to hear. They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths.
[4650.90 → 4656.00] He warns the Ephesian church in the same way, in a message that he preached to them when he was
[4656.00 → 4661.14] visiting them. We read this in the book of Acts. He says, keep watch over yourselves and all the flock
[4661.14 → 4666.22] of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be shepherds of the church of God, which he
[4666.22 → 4672.62] bought with his own blood. And here he says explicitly, I know that after I leave, savage
[4672.62 → 4679.18] wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock. Even from your own number, men will rise
[4679.18 → 4684.86] and distort the truth in order to draw away disciples after them. So be on your guard.
[4686.86 → 4692.70] Now, we just installed elders this morning. Elders, this is one of your chief tasks,
[4692.70 → 4700.70] right? Do not miss the responsibility to be on your guard because it is a gift to us as a church family.
[4702.86 → 4710.06] And in these circumstances of Paul, he's urging the Roman church to watch out for the same sorts of
[4710.06 → 4717.32] things. And I want to suggest to you that as we have read the letter to the Romans, as we look at the
[4717.32 → 4725.56] rest of the New Testament, as we hold up history, the kinds of things that Paul is urging us to watch out
[4725.56 → 4735.24] for are generally a version of two different things. And so let's do this work for a moment. On the one
[4735.24 → 4747.08] hand, you have a group of people who want to keep the rules and the regulations for belonging really high.
[4747.32 → 4755.88] Now, sometimes in the Bible scholarly study, this group of people are called Judaizes,
[4756.36 → 4762.20] right? They're a group of people who follow after Paul and who come in, and they teach that the Jewish
[4762.20 → 4768.44] laws and the Jewish regulations about dietary concerns or about ceremonial identity have to be
[4768.44 → 4774.68] followed if you want to be a faithful disciple of Jesus. And so they advocate for things like
[4774.68 → 4780.92] circumcision. They advocate for things like different ceremonial regulations. This is exactly what
[4780.92 → 4790.12] happens in Galatians. Now, this is a version and a broader way of understanding this is a version of
[4790.12 → 4796.04] legalism that is of returning to the law. And this idea continues to today.
[4796.04 → 4804.52] Right? On the one hand, like we have to watch out for imposing a new law, a new social order on those who have
[4804.52 → 4812.12] received freedom in Christ Jesus. Because this is our new gospel reality. It is for freedom that Christ has set you free.
[4812.12 → 4823.96] Now, most often as these sorts of things continue, they show up in much more subtle ways. They show up in sort of unspoken social pressures.
[4823.96 → 4831.88] Right? One that doesn't apply to us here, so we can use it as a good example.
[4831.88 → 4835.88] But maybe some of you are familiar with this growing up in certain kinds of churches.
[4835.88 → 4841.80] Right? If you didn't wear black socks, you got in trouble.
[4841.80 → 4849.64] Or if you didn't wear a tie to church, right, you would have an elder come up to you afterwards and say,
[4849.64 → 4855.00] here in the lost and found, we have spare ties. Please put this on before you go in.
[4855.00 → 4858.92] And we kind of chuckle at it, but like these things happened.
[4858.92 → 4865.56] Right? This is a new social pressure that's being added. And there's a phrase for this in Latin.
[4865.56 → 4874.52] It's nova lex, which means new law. Right? And people, this new law is offered to keep people in,
[4874.52 → 4881.64] but also to keep people out. And this new law is offered to keep people comfortable.
[4882.68 → 4887.96] Because it's easy to manage. The expectations are clear. And I know exactly which box I have to tick
[4887.96 → 4897.80] in order to keep these people satisfied. Instead, what's actually happening in this,
[4897.80 → 4910.84] right, is that the people of God are being reburdened with a law. Right? The gospel, though,
[4910.84 → 4918.28] doesn't reburden us with new rules in order to satisfy God. Instead, very clearly, the gospel of
[4918.28 → 4925.08] Jesus Christ says that He lived the life I should have lived. That He has perfectly kept all the
[4925.08 → 4931.64] commands of God. That the law of God is perfectly fulfilled in the obedience of Jesus Christ.
[4931.64 → 4938.44] And through our union with Him, by grace through faith, His righteousness is granted to us.
[4939.80 → 4946.44] It is imputed on us, is the old theological word. Such that now, whenever God looks at you,
[4947.80 → 4953.80] He doesn't see black socks or no tie. He sees His Son, Jesus Christ.
[4955.08 → 4963.40] That's the gospel. He sees the perfect righteousness of the spotless Lamb. So that I can stand and say,
[4963.40 → 4970.52] I am whiter than snow because I have been clothed with Christ. You can stand and say,
[4970.52 → 4977.88] I am made new because Christ has raised me up in newness of life. That's the first part of the gospel.
[4977.88 → 4985.48] And then the second part, right? The double imputation here is that my sins have been handed over to Jesus.
[4986.04 → 4992.36] That He bore the punishment for them on the cross. Right? He is the sacrifice of propitiation.
[4992.36 → 4995.96] He is the atoning one. 1 John 4 says,
[4995.96 → 5004.28] And this is love. Not that we loved God, but that He loved us and gave His Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.
[5005.72 → 5010.28] He lived the life I should have lived and died the death that I deserved.
[5011.16 → 5014.28] And so what we're seeing, right, is that there's nothing that I can do.
[5014.28 → 5020.76] I'm unable to earn my salvation, so I need the perfect righteousness of Jesus Christ.
[5020.76 → 5027.40] I am unable to pay the price for my sin, and so I need the perfect sacrifice for Jesus Christ.
[5027.40 → 5034.44] And because He has paid it all, because He has done it all, we are free from the burdens of the law.
[5034.44 → 5039.80] And the new command for Christians is to love one another.
[5045.56 → 5054.44] But remember, I said that there are two versions of the kinds of things that Paul tells us we need to be on the watch-out for.
[5054.44 → 5060.04] And on the one hand, we have these legalistic structures reburdening people with a new law.
[5060.04 → 5070.04] But equally dangerous, and I want to suggest actually even more common in the world today,
[5070.04 → 5081.32] and in and among churches today, is the idea that the gospel doesn't transform us.
[5083.40 → 5085.64] Okay, this is what we've seen all along in the book of Romans.
[5085.64 → 5089.80] The gospel is the power of God unto salvation. That's Romans 1.16.
[5090.04 → 5096.52] And so we are transformed by the renewal of our minds, so we no longer conform to the pattern of this world.
[5096.52 → 5098.36] That's Romans 12.2.
[5098.36 → 5101.80] Paul writes explicitly of this very thing in Romans 6.
[5101.80 → 5104.28] He says, and I think this one's on-screen, there you go.
[5105.00 → 5108.44] Shall we sin because we're not under the law, but under grace?
[5109.00 → 5110.36] By no means!
[5110.36 → 5114.36] Don't you know that when you offer yourselves to someone as obedient slaves,
[5114.36 → 5116.44] you are slaves to the one you obey?
[5116.44 → 5121.16] Whether you are slaves to sin, which leads to death, or to obedience, which leads to righteousness.
[5122.04 → 5127.80] But thanks be to God that, though you used to be slaves to sin, you have come to obey from your heart
[5127.80 → 5130.52] the pattern of teaching that has now claimed your allegiance.
[5131.08 → 5134.92] You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness.
[5134.92 → 5137.24] Right?
[5137.24 → 5137.64] Hear that.
[5137.64 → 5142.36] Your union with Jesus, if it is sincere, changes everything.
[5143.96 → 5149.00] Your union with Jesus, if it is true, redefines your lived reality.
[5149.00 → 5150.36] Right?
[5150.36 → 5155.80] Your union with Jesus, because it is made real by the work of the Holy Spirit in you,
[5155.80 → 5160.68] gives you the very power of God to live the life that He has called you to live.
[5160.68 → 5164.36] To live the obedient life that He has designed you to live.
[5164.36 → 5168.28] To live the way that He has called you and made you and reshaped you.
[5168.28 → 5173.00] The way that He has regenerated you, taken you out of death into life to live.
[5173.00 → 5181.32] Because Christ has won the victory for you over sin and death, you have overcome all the different ways
[5181.32 → 5185.16] sin and deathliness are showing up in your life right now.
[5187.00 → 5196.04] And I really believe, I really believe that one of the greatest sadnesses in the Christian church in the West today
[5196.04 → 5203.72] is our lack of belief, our lack of faith, our lack of trust in the power of God to transform you
[5204.44 → 5206.52] by your union with Jesus Christ.
[5208.36 → 5215.64] But hear this, you can actually really overcome your addictions by the power of God.
[5217.16 → 5222.60] You can actually really heal your marriages by the power of God.
[5222.60 → 5227.88] You can actually overcome pornography by the power of God.
[5227.88 → 5234.76] You are no longer slaves to your desires, whichever way they are oriented or disoriented,
[5234.76 → 5242.60] because the Holy Spirit in you, right, because of the Holy Spirit in you, temptation only has the power you give it.
[5242.60 → 5249.40] Even the kind of gossip that slips out of your mouth without a thought
[5249.40 → 5256.92] can be stopped in you because of your union with Jesus Christ.
[5258.12 → 5260.60] He makes you able.
[5262.92 → 5264.04] He makes that real.
[5265.32 → 5266.68] He makes that possible.
[5266.68 → 5276.28] And the problem in the world today is that there are teachers who will stand on a stage like this one
[5276.28 → 5281.72] and tell you that you will always be the way that you currently are and that that's okay.
[5284.28 → 5288.36] The problem is that there are people who will say that's just who you are
[5288.36 → 5290.68] and you don't have to change.
[5294.76 → 5296.44] But if you hear the power of God
[5301.56 → 5306.76] that breaks my heart
[5306.76 → 5313.56] because when someone stands before you and says you don't have to be changed,
[5317.40 → 5322.04] when someone stands before you and says you don't have to be transformed,
[5323.48 → 5328.36] it breaks my heart because they are robbing you of the power of the gospel.
[5328.36 → 5333.40] They are robbing you of the power of your union with Jesus Christ.
[5333.40 → 5337.16] They are robbing you of what he gives in the Holy Spirit.
[5338.44 → 5338.76] Right?
[5338.76 → 5344.60] They are robbing you of the truth that he has lived the life I should have lived and died the death that I deserved.
[5344.84 → 5347.48] They are robbing you of the glory of God,
[5348.36 → 5353.88] which, as the ancient church father Grenades said, is the human being fully alive.
[5353.88 → 5367.24] They are robbing you of real, authentic, genuine, Christ-shaped, God-filled, Spirit-powered life.
[5371.56 → 5372.68] And we just settle for it.
[5376.44 → 5377.40] We just accept it.
[5380.84 → 5381.88] Because it sounds good.
[5381.88 → 5385.56] It sounds a little bit easier, actually.
[5390.04 → 5391.08] It's comfortable.
[5393.40 → 5396.12] I don't actually have to change.
[5397.96 → 5405.48] See, on both sides, whether it's illegalism, which is a re-burdening of a nova lex, a new law,
[5405.64 → 5410.68] or antinomians, which is a rejection of laws and rules,
[5410.68 → 5414.76] or whether it is a denying of the power of God to transform lives.
[5416.04 → 5422.84] All of these ideas on both sides miss the truth that the command of Jesus to love one another
[5423.08 → 5428.52] informs our new obedience and the new possibility of our obedience.
[5428.84 → 5433.40] Loving one another starts with being transformed to be like him.
[5433.40 → 5437.96] Loving one another starts with the truth that you are not your own, but you have been bought.
[5438.76 → 5440.20] You have been paid for.
[5440.44 → 5442.96] You belong to Jesus Christ.
[5443.16 → 5445.84] That's the gospel of God's love for us.
[5445.84 → 5456.00] Loving one another is then calling us all to love each other in the same way,
[5456.00 → 5458.40] in the way of sacrifice.
[5461.84 → 5469.92] Sacrificing for each other, but also sacrificing ourselves, our own pride,
[5469.92 → 5482.32] our own privilege, our own status, our own desires, our own flesh, taking up our cross daily and following after Jesus is the act of love.
[5483.52 → 5488.96] Proclaiming the truth of the gospel is a call to this kind of love.
[5488.96 → 5492.24] Proclaiming the truth of the gospel is a call to this kind of love.
[5492.24 → 5501.60] Paul says, watch out, because their false teaching causes divisions and creates obstacles.
[5505.60 → 5512.88] The only way to see clearly the truth and the real gospel,
[5512.88 → 5518.68] the only way to stand against the division and to step over the obstacle,
[5518.96 → 5529.12] is to be intimately and deeply filled with Jesus Christ and intimately and deeply familiar with his word.
[5532.56 → 5538.16] Because you see, the gospel itself is enough of a stumbling block for people to trip over.
[5539.20 → 5543.68] 1 Corinthians 1 says that the gospel is foolishness and a stumbling block.
[5544.64 → 5546.64] We don't need to add to it.
[5546.64 → 5548.64] 1 Corinthians 1 says that the gospel is not a place of love.
[5548.64 → 5548.96] 1 Corinthians 1 says that the gospel is not a place of love.
[5548.96 → 5556.96] And of these kinds of teachers, Paul says, such people are not serving our Lord Christ, but their own appetites.
[5558.16 → 5559.04] And notice that, right?
[5559.04 → 5564.96] When he says they're serving their own appetites, it means they're serving their own desires, their own ends, their own priorities.
[5565.60 → 5568.96] And we saw this already, all the way back in Romans 1.
[5568.96 → 5572.16] If you have ears to hear and eyes to see, right?
[5572.16 → 5582.16] In Romans 1, we saw that sin starts with a desire that causes someone to exchange the truth of God for a lie.
[5582.16 → 5584.72] Romans 1, 24 and 25.
[5586.56 → 5594.04] No matter how good it sounds, whether by smooth talk and flattery, they are deceiving the minds of God's people.
[5594.04 → 5598.34] And it denies the gospel.
[5600.12 → 5601.32] Denies the gospel.
[5602.28 → 5606.18] And that is not good.
[5606.96 → 5608.38] And so watch out.
[5609.14 → 5610.14] Watch out.
[5610.84 → 5616.20] Paul says, instead, I want you to be wise about what is good and innocent about what is evil.
[5616.20 → 5625.64] And so as we go this morning into whatever this week brings for you, know that you go in Jesus.
[5626.64 → 5626.86] Right?
[5626.94 → 5628.50] Go united to him.
[5628.86 → 5631.04] Go transformed by him.
[5631.60 → 5636.22] Go clinging to the gospel, which is the truth that Jesus clings to you.
[5636.22 → 5642.48] Go clinging to Jesus in union with him and watch your life be transformed.
[5642.48 → 5647.02] And go in the word.
[5647.86 → 5655.90] Go deeply rooted and established in what God has said to us in the very voice of Jesus for our lives of faith.
[5655.90 → 5659.56] So that you may test and know.
[5659.76 → 5661.82] So that you may guard the good deposit.
[5661.98 → 5672.62] So that you may watch out for these teachers who would rob you of the joy of the Lord.
[5673.48 → 5675.96] Who would rob you of his gospel.
[5675.96 → 5685.18] And then go in and with this community of faith.
[5686.96 → 5688.22] Go in Jesus.
[5689.26 → 5690.20] In the word.
[5691.06 → 5692.20] And in the community.
[5693.34 → 5697.12] And then go under the banner.
[5697.66 → 5705.04] Under the truth that the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet.
[5705.04 → 5708.58] I don't know how many of you remember Genesis 3.13.
[5708.82 → 5711.44] But in that very beginning of the story.
[5711.54 → 5720.44] God promises that the son of Eve would come who would crush the head of the serpent.
[5722.74 → 5724.04] Satan is crushed.
[5724.80 → 5726.16] He is being crushed.
[5726.16 → 5728.52] And he will be crushed.
[5728.52 → 5732.62] This is the gospel of your peace.
[5733.08 → 5735.64] And so go in Jesus.
[5736.12 → 5737.16] In his word.
[5737.48 → 5738.48] And in the community.
[5739.26 → 5739.80] Knowing.
[5741.50 → 5742.54] Knowing.
[5743.22 → 5747.12] That he has won the victory.
[5748.10 → 5752.18] That he has given you his gospel.
[5752.58 → 5755.76] And that changes everything.
[5755.76 → 5756.76] That he has given you his gospel.
[5756.76 → 5757.70] Someone needs to say amen.
[5759.06 → 5760.40] Let's stand and pray together.
[5768.78 → 5770.32] Lord Jesus Christ.
[5770.56 → 5775.04] You have promised transformation by your spirit.
[5775.18 → 5780.96] You have promised that we would be made new in the hearing and in the believing of your word.
[5780.96 → 5786.80] You have promised that we would be so filled with to overflowing with your love.
[5786.88 → 5790.30] That we would be sent out in the power of your name.
[5790.42 → 5795.34] And so send us out in the power of your name.
[5796.12 → 5800.38] Send us out deeply convicted of the truth of the gospel.
[5800.84 → 5806.42] Send us out deeply convicted of our union with you that changes everything about who we are.
[5806.42 → 5809.42] So that we may not be burdened again with a new law.
[5809.52 → 5815.40] But also so that we may be transformed into newness of life to be like you.
[5818.28 → 5820.14] Hear our prayer.
[5820.14 → 5823.14] We pray in Jesus name.
[5823.94 → 5824.38] Amen.
[5825.30 → 5825.74] Amen.
[5836.42 → 5857.64] My hope is built on nothing less Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
[5857.64 → 5865.04] I dare not trust the sweetest friend
[5865.04 → 5873.04] But wholly trust in Jesus' name
[5873.04 → 5883.46] My hope is built on nothing less
[5883.46 → 5887.76] In Jesus' blood and righteousness
[5887.76 → 5895.46] I dare not trust the sweetest friend
[5895.46 → 5902.46] But wholly trust in Jesus' name
[5902.46 → 5910.46] Christ alone, cornerstone
[5910.46 → 5917.88] Weak made strong in the Saviour's love
[5917.88 → 5928.46] Through the storm He is Lord, Lord of all
[5928.46 → 5939.88] When darkness seems to hide His face
[5939.88 → 5945.88] I rest on His unchanging grace
[5945.88 → 5953.30] In every high and stormy gale
[5953.30 → 5959.30] My anchor holds within the veil
[5959.30 → 5966.72] My anchor holds within the veil
[5966.72 → 5974.14] Christ alone, cornerstone
[5974.14 → 5980.14] Weak made strong in the Saviour's love
[5980.14 → 5992.14] Through the storm He is Lord, Lord of all
[5992.14 → 6001.56] When He shall come with trumpet sound
[6001.56 → 6007.56] Oh, may I then in Him be found
[6007.56 → 6014.56] Dressed in His righteousness alone
[6014.56 → 6021.98] Fall, let's stand before the throne
[6021.98 → 6029.40] Christ alone, Lord of all
[6029.40 → 6042.82] Christ alone, cornerstone
[6042.82 → 6050.24] Weak made strong in the Saviour's love
[6050.24 → 6055.66] Christ alone, cornerstone
[6055.66 → 6060.66] Weak made strong in the Saviour's love
[6060.66 → 6061.66] In the Saviour's love
[6061.66 → 6067.66] Through the storm He is Lord, Lord of all
[6067.66 → 6068.66] Christ alone, cornerstone
[6068.66 → 6075.08] Weak made strong in the Saviour's love
[6075.08 → 6076.08] Christ alone, cornerstone
[6076.08 → 6077.08] Weak made strong in the Saviour's love
[6077.08 → 6081.08] Christ alone, cornerstone
[6081.08 → 6082.08] Weak made strong in the Saviour's love
[6082.08 → 6086.08] Weak made strong in the Saviour's love
[6086.08 → 6090.08] Through the storm He is Lord, Lord of all
[6090.08 → 6095.08] He is Lord, Lord of all
[6095.08 → 6125.06] Lord of all
[6125.06 → 6127.06] Weak made strong in the Saviour's love
[6127.06 → 6128.88] Just an encouragement, go with two
[6128.88 → 6131.14] Maybe three invitations
[6131.14 → 6134.98] First, stick around following our service
[6134.98 → 6137.12] To gather in community
[6137.12 → 6139.10] There will be some refreshments available
[6139.10 → 6141.04] Spend some time together
[6141.04 → 6143.50] Sharing what God has been up to in your life
[6143.50 → 6145.62] Asking for prayer, receiving prayer
[6145.62 → 6146.90] Celebrating, giving thanks
[6146.90 → 6148.52] And expressing need
[6148.52 → 6150.78] If you would like specific prayers
[6150.78 → 6152.90] There will be someone up front here
[6152.90 → 6154.74] With a yellow name tag on
[6154.74 → 6155.68] They would love to meet you
[6155.68 → 6157.54] And lead you in prayer there
[6157.54 → 6159.32] That is your second invitation
[6159.32 → 6160.70] And then thirdly
[6160.70 → 6161.88] Your last invitation
[6161.88 → 6165.14] Please, if you are curious
[6165.14 → 6166.62] About Safe Families Canada
[6166.62 → 6167.80] And the work that they do
[6167.80 → 6171.60] We'll say in 15 minutes
[6171.60 → 6173.50] We'll start the presentation
[6173.50 → 6174.78] In the multipurpose room
[6174.78 → 6176.58] So there's a chance to grab a coffee
[6176.58 → 6177.96] And connect with a couple of people
[6177.96 → 6179.72] And then we'll move over that way
[6179.72 → 6181.40] To help facilitate that
[6181.40 → 6182.46] I need someone who knows
[6182.46 → 6183.56] How to make an Apple
[6183.56 → 6185.72] A MacBook computer
[6185.72 → 6188.38] Work on the projector in there
[6188.38 → 6189.58] Through screen mirroring
[6189.58 → 6190.82] So talk to me after service
[6190.82 → 6191.70] If you know how to do that
[6191.70 → 6194.32] As you go, receive
[6194.32 → 6196.46] The blessing of our God
[6196.46 → 6199.98] God go before you
[6199.98 → 6200.94] To lead you
[6200.94 → 6202.78] God go behind you
[6202.78 → 6203.70] To protect you
[6203.70 → 6205.44] God go beneath you
[6205.44 → 6206.34] To support you
[6206.34 → 6207.96] And God go beside you
[6207.96 → 6209.00] To befriend you
[6209.00 → 6210.88] Do not be afraid
[6210.88 → 6212.46] But let the blessing of God
[6212.46 → 6213.40] Come upon you today
[6213.40 → 6215.04] Do not be afraid
[6215.04 → 6217.76] But go in peace
[6217.76 → 6221.12] To love and serve the Lord
[6221.12 → 6222.82] Amen
[6239.00 → 6242.80] You're the Lion of Judah
[6242.80 → 6244.98] The Lamb who was slain
[6244.98 → 6246.82] You ascended to heaven
[6246.82 → 6248.92] And evermore will reign
[6248.92 → 6250.90] At the end of the age
[6250.90 → 6253.02] When the earth you reclaimed
[6253.02 → 6256.66] They will gather the nations before you
[6256.66 → 6258.98] And the eyes of all men
[6258.98 → 6261.12] Will be fixed on the lam
[6261.12 → 6263.50] Who was crucified
[6263.50 → 6268.28] With wisdom and mercy and justice
[6268.28 → 6272.74] You'll reign at your Father's side
[6272.74 → 6275.24] And the angels will cry
[6275.24 → 6279.38] Hail the Lamb
[6279.38 → 6282.96] Who was slain for the world
[6282.96 → 6286.26] Ruling power
[6286.26 → 6290.76] And the earth will reply
[6290.76 → 6294.26] You shall reign
[6294.26 → 6298.64] As the King of all kings
[6298.64 → 6300.84] And the Lord of all kings
[6300.84 → 6310.34] There's a shield in our hand
[6310.34 → 6312.42] And a sword in our side
[6312.42 → 6314.42] There's a fire in our spirit
[6314.42 → 6316.26] That cannot be denied
[6316.26 → 6318.58] As the Father has told us
[6318.58 → 6320.38] For these you have died
[6320.38 → 6324.02] For the nations that gather before you
[6324.02 → 6326.24] And the ears of all men
[6326.24 → 6328.30] Need to hear of the Lamb
[6328.30 → 6330.88] Who was crucified
[6330.88 → 6334.20] Who descended to hell
[6334.20 → 6336.24] Yet was raised up to reign
[6336.24 → 6339.62] At His Father's side
[6339.62 → 6342.18] And the angels will cry
[6342.18 → 6345.74] Hail the Lamb
[6345.74 → 6349.88] Who was slain for the world
[6349.88 → 6353.22] Ruling power
[6353.22 → 6357.48] And the earth will reply
[6357.48 → 6362.48] You shall reign
[6362.48 → 6365.10] As the King of all kings
[6365.10 → 6367.14] And the Lord of all lords
[6367.14 → 6369.12] And the angels will cry
[6369.12 → 6373.48] Hail the Lamb
[6373.48 → 6376.72] Who was slain for the world
[6376.72 → 6379.48] Ruling power
[6379.48 → 6384.26] And the earth will reply
[6384.26 → 6389.26] You shall reign
[6389.26 → 6392.02] As the King of all kings
[6392.02 → 6394.18] And the Lord of all lords
[6394.18 → 6396.00] As the King of all kings
[6396.00 → 6400.10] And the Lord of all lords
[6400.10 → 6401.18] Go in peace
[6401.18 → 6410.10] .
[6422.64 → 6424.94] 0t
[6424.94 → 6431.94] so
[6431.94 → 6461.92] Let's go.
[6461.94 → 6491.92] Let's go.
