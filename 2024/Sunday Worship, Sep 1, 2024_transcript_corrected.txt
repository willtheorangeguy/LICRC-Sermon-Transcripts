[550.74 → 554.74] Yeah
[564.74 → 570.74] Good morning
[570.74 → 574.74] Welcome to church
[574.74 → 578.74] Special welcome if you are a guest with us this morning
[578.74 → 582.74] My name is Chris. I'm one of the pastors here at Langley Emanuel
[582.74 → 586.74] And it's my privilege along with these others and some that we haven't yet met
[586.74 → 590.74] To lead in our shared worship this morning
[590.74 → 594.74] Before we begin we've got a couple announcements to run through
[594.74 → 602.74] And the first is that after church today we are going over to Topham Park
[602.74 → 606.74] Which is down 216 at 91st
[606.74 → 608.74] Yeah, 216 and 91st
[608.74 → 610.74] And we're going to have some time together
[610.74 → 612.74] There's a potluck, we're going to play some softball
[612.74 → 618.74] And I think there's also going to be like an outdoor volleyball net set up in one of the corners there
[618.74 → 622.74] For those who don't want to play softball
[622.74 → 624.74] And so we want to encourage you to come to join us
[624.74 → 626.74] I hope that you are prepared for that
[626.74 → 628.74] And that you have some meal
[628.74 → 630.74] A meal ready to share
[630.74 → 632.74] If this is the first you're hearing about it
[632.74 → 634.74] We want you to come
[634.74 → 636.74] Even if you don't have a meal
[636.74 → 638.74] In fact, perhaps especially if you don't have a meal
[638.74 → 640.74] Because there will be more food than we know what to do with
[640.74 → 644.74] So come on out at Topham Park after service today
[644.74 → 650.74] We're going to go from about 12 until 3 playing some softball together
[650.74 → 652.74] Before you head out to the park
[652.74 → 656.74] This is your last chance to sign up to volunteer at Reactivate
[656.74 → 662.74] And so Reactivate is a youth conference that we are hosting here next weekend
[662.74 → 668.74] And we have about 10 or so slots left to fill for volunteer positions
[668.74 → 673.74] And so Rachel will be at the back at the Connect booth after service
[673.74 → 677.74] And she can help you sign up in those last few places there
[677.74 → 679.74] Additionally, next week Sunday
[679.74 → 681.74] We're going to worship with all the youth that come
[681.74 → 684.74] And so we're really excited about that worship service
[684.74 → 686.74] We're hoping to pack this place out
[686.74 → 692.74] And, so please come expecting good, loud, boisterous worship
[692.74 → 698.74] Expecting about 200 youth and leaders joining with us as well
[698.74 → 704.74] But we really want to fill this place and surround that morning in worship together
[704.74 → 707.74] And then lastly, one final announcement
[707.74 → 709.74] If you've been here the last couple of weeks
[709.74 → 715.74] We've been talking about a CPR and AED first aid training session
[715.74 → 718.74] That's going to be happening in October, on October 19th
[718.74 → 720.74] It's going to run from 1.30 to 4.30
[720.74 → 722.74] If that's something you're interested in
[722.74 → 724.74] Please talk to Heather Astra
[724.74 → 726.74] She would love to get you signed up for that
[726.74 → 730.74] The cost for that has been reduced as well to $45
[730.74 → 734.74] And, so please sign up, participate in that
[734.74 → 737.74] If that's something that you would be blessed by
[737.74 → 740.74] Or the ministry that you run here would be blessed to have you in doing that
[740.74 → 742.74] I think that's it for announcements
[742.74 → 744.74] And so, are you guys ready to worship?
[744.74 → 747.74] Yeah, there's someone, good
[747.74 → 749.74] Let's stand together
[749.74 → 750.74] Let's stand together
[750.74 → 755.74] We are ushered by God's Spirit into His presence to worship Him
[755.74 → 757.74] And He meets us in this place
[757.74 → 760.74] He welcomes us, and He greets us in His name
[760.74 → 765.74] And so, open your heart, open your hands, receive the greeting of our good God
[765.74 → 770.74] Grace, mercy, and peace to you
[770.74 → 771.74] From God our Father
[771.74 → 775.74] From the Lord Jesus Christ, Son, and our Saviour
[775.74 → 778.74] Through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit
[778.74 → 779.74] Amen
[779.74 → 783.74] As God has greeted us, I invite you to turn to those around you
[783.74 → 785.74] And welcome them in our worship this morning
[785.74 → 786.74] Thank you
[815.74 → 821.74] Our call to worship today is from Psalm 95
[821.74 → 824.74] Come, let us sing joy to the Lord
[824.74 → 827.74] Let us shout aloud to the rock of our salvation
[827.74 → 831.74] Let us come before Him with thanksgiving and extol Him with music and song
[831.74 → 836.74] For the Lord is the great God, the great King above all gods
[836.74 → 840.74] In His hands are the depths of the earth and the mountain peaks belong to Him
[840.74 → 844.74] The sea is His, for He made it, and His hands formed the dry land
[844.74 → 846.74] Come, let us bow down in worship
[846.74 → 848.74] Let us kneel before the Lord our Maker
[848.74 → 850.74] For He is our God
[850.74 → 852.74] And we are the people of His pasture
[852.74 → 854.74] The flock under His care
[854.74 → 875.74] He is the Lord
[875.74 → 877.74] He is the Lord
[877.74 → 879.74] He brings the light
[879.74 → 883.74] He is the Lord
[883.74 → 888.74] His full-tills of darkness created the light
[888.74 → 892.74] He is the Lord
[892.74 → 894.74] For His light comes to Him
[894.74 → 896.74] Never-ending near days
[896.74 → 900.74] He is the Lord
[900.74 → 905.74] When He grows in power, and we call on His name
[905.74 → 908.74] He is the Lord
[908.74 → 909.74] To His power
[909.74 → 913.74] To His power

[947.74 → 951.84] You are Lord
[951.84 → 956.82] We ask not for riches but look to the cross
[956.82 → 960.60] You are Lord
[960.60 → 965.40] And for our inheritance to steal us the loss
[965.40 → 969.18] You are Lord

[1267.18 → 1269.18] The apostles' creed
[1269.18 → 1278.86] I believe in God the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
[1279.24 → 1283.74] I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,
[1284.34 → 1288.96] who was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary.
[1289.78 → 1295.18] He was sovereign under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.
[1295.74 → 1297.02] He descended to hell.
[1297.02 → 1300.46] The third day he rose again from the dead.
[1301.08 → 1306.56] He ascended to heaven and is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.
[1307.36 → 1310.74] From there he will come to judge the living and the dead.
[1311.72 → 1315.90] I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church,
[1316.52 → 1319.94] the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins,
[1320.54 → 1325.18] the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.
[1327.02 → 1354.28] I believe in Jesus,
[1354.28 → 1360.28] I believe he is the Son of God.
[1362.14 → 1366.28] I believe he died and rose again.
[1368.38 → 1372.28] I believe he paid for us all.
[1372.28 → 1378.28] I believe he is here now.
[1378.28 → 1380.28] I believe he is here now.
[1380.28 → 1381.28] I believe he is here now.
[1381.28 → 1384.28] Standing in our name.
[1384.28 → 1386.28] Standing in our name.
[1386.28 → 1390.28] Here is the power to heal now.
[1390.28 → 1392.28] The power to heal now.
[1392.28 → 1394.28] And the grace to heal now.
[1394.28 → 1396.28] And the grace to forgive.
[1396.28 → 1398.28] I believe he is here now.
[1398.28 → 1400.28] I believe he is here now.
[1400.28 → 1402.28] I believe he is here now.
[1402.28 → 1404.28] I believe he is here now.
[1404.28 → 1406.28] I believe you are here now.
[1406.28 → 1410.28] I believe you are here now.
[1410.28 → 1412.28] I believe you are here now.
[1412.28 → 1416.28] I believe you are here now.
[1416.28 → 1418.28] I believe you are here now.
[1418.28 → 1428.28] I believe you are here now.
[1428.28 → 1433.28] Standing in our hands
[1433.28 → 1437.38] Here with the power to heal
[1437.38 → 1444.28] And the grace to forgive
[1444.28 → 1450.28] I'm leaving you, Lord
[1450.28 → 1456.28] I leave you, Lord, Son of God
[1456.28 → 1462.28] I leave you, die and rose again
[1462.28 → 1468.28] I leave you, pray for us all
[1468.28 → 1474.28] I leave you, are you now?
[1474.28 → 1477.28] Standing in our hands
[1477.28 → 1481.28] Standing in our hands
[1481.28 → 1485.28] Here with the power to heal
[1485.28 → 1491.28] And the grace to forgive
[1491.28 → 1497.28] I leave you, are you now?
[1497.28 → 1499.28] I leave you, are you now?
[1499.28 → 1503.28] Standing in our hands
[1503.28 → 1505.28] Standing in our hands
[1505.28 → 1509.28] Here with the power to heal
[1509.28 → 1515.28] And the grace to forgive
[1515.28 → 1519.28] And the grace to forgive
[1519.28 → 1521.28] Amen
[1521.28 → 1531.28] Come to Jesus Christ the crucified
[1531.28 → 1541.28] Raised the praying at the Father's side
[1541.28 → 1547.28] His foolishness to those who cannot see
[1547.28 → 1553.28] Blinded by the lies that I believe
[1553.28 → 1557.28] So let the church arise
[1557.28 → 1559.28] Let the act of rain
[1559.28 → 1561.28] Longed by the world has heard
[1561.28 → 1563.28] And the risen King
[1563.28 → 1565.28] Song of the redeemed
[1565.28 → 1567.28] Holy we shall sing
[1567.28 → 1569.28] Hope of all the world has heard
[1569.28 → 1571.28] Christ the risen King
[1571.28 → 1573.28] Will wait
[1573.28 → 1574.28] We are not ashamed
[1574.28 → 1577.28] For the God of the world has heard
[1577.28 → 1579.28] Let the act of rain
[1579.28 → 1581.28] Let the act of rain
[1581.28 → 1583.28] Let the act of rain
[1583.28 → 1585.28] Of all the world has heard
[1585.28 → 1587.28] Christ the risen King
[1587.28 → 1589.28] Song of the redeemed
[1589.28 → 1591.28] Holy we shall sing
[1591.28 → 1593.28] Hope of all the world has earned
[1593.28 → 1595.28] Christ the risen King
[1595.28 → 1599.28] Oh wait, we are not ashamed
[1599.28 → 1607.10] For the gospel is the power of God to save
[1607.10 → 1612.26] This way, we are not ashamed
[1612.26 → 1618.32] For we have no other Saviour to proclaim
[1618.32 → 1624.96] Christ, you know the life, the truth, the way
[1629.28 → 1642.28] The enemies of God are in a rage
[1642.28 → 1649.38] Opposing Him, their efforts are in vain
[1649.38 → 1655.12] For every age the gospel will endure
[1655.12 → 1662.12] Spirits with the church forevermore
[1662.92 → 1670.28] So let the church arise, let me at the ring
[1670.28 → 1677.12] To all the world has heard, Christ the risen King
[1677.12 → 1683.44] A song of glory deep, boldly we shall sing
[1683.44 → 1689.44] The hope of all the world is Christ the risen King
[1689.44 → 1694.44] For we, we are not ashamed
[1694.44 → 1702.44] For the gospel is the power of God to save
[1702.44 → 1708.44] And speak, we are not ashamed
[1708.44 → 1714.44] For we have no other Saviour to proclaim
[1714.44 → 1721.44] And speak, we are not ashamed
[1721.44 → 1729.44] For we have no other Saviour to proclaim
[1729.44 → 1734.44] And speak, we are not ashamed
[1734.44 → 1740.44] For we have a great salvation in His name
[1740.44 → 1747.44] Rise alone, the light, the truth, the way
[1747.44 → 1754.44] Rise alone, the light, the truth, the way
[1754.44 → 1761.44] Please be seated
[1761.44 → 1765.44] Please be seated
[1765.44 → 1789.44] So good morning, my name is Pearl
[1789.44 → 1792.44] And I am a deacon here at Langley Emanuel
[1792.44 → 1797.44] We continue our worship by having an offering
[1797.44 → 1802.44] Today's offering is both for the ministries of this church
[1802.44 → 1804.44] And for seafarers ministry
[1804.44 → 1809.44] Seafarers ministry is supported by our local classes
[1809.44 → 1814.44] And it serves all the seafarers that come in to the harbour
[1814.44 → 1816.44] To the port of Vancouver
[1816.44 → 1820.44] And the mission and vision of seafarers ministry
[1820.44 → 1822.44] Is to provide friendship
[1822.44 → 1826.44] And a place to hang out on shore
[1826.44 → 1830.44] And to spread the gospel to the seafarers
[1830.44 → 1832.44] That come into Vancouver
[1832.44 → 1837.44] And you can well imagine that that is a much appreciated ministry
[1837.44 → 1842.44] As the seafarers are often at sea for more than six months of the year
[1842.44 → 1843.44] They are away from their families
[1843.44 → 1847.44] So to have a place where they can be provided with some friendship
[1847.44 → 1852.44] And with some good news is a respite for them
[1852.44 → 1857.44] Researching the website
[1857.44 → 1862.44] I was informed that about 90% of everything that we have
[1862.44 → 1866.44] Actually comes in via the ship ports
[1866.44 → 1871.44] So they are a real service to the entire economy of the world
[1871.44 → 1879.44] Currently there is one full-time chaplain at the CRCC seafarers
[1879.44 → 1881.44] His name is Gary RUSTA
[1881.44 → 1885.44] And then this past summer there was an intern there as well
[1885.44 → 1888.44] An internist student from Regent College
[1888.44 → 1891.44] Who apparently was a real blessing to Gary
[1891.44 → 1894.44] Because it offered him a chance to have some time off
[1894.44 → 1898.44] In Psalm 96 we read
[1898.44 → 1900.44] Ascribe to the Lord
[1900.44 → 1902.44] Ascribe to the Lord
[1902.44 → 1904.44] O family of nations
[1904.44 → 1907.44] Ascribe to the Lord glory and strength
[1907.44 → 1910.44] Ascribe to the Lord the glory to his name
[1910.44 → 1912.44] Bring an offering
[1912.44 → 1914.44] And come into his courts
[1914.44 → 1916.44] So do give generously
[1916.44 → 1919.44] As we have been so generously blessed by our Heavenly Father
[1919.44 → 1921.44] Fly SA talk
[1921.44 → 1925.44] O
[1925.44 → 1927.44] Amen.
[1955.44 → 1957.44] Amen.
[1985.44 → 1987.44] Amen.
[2015.44 → 2017.44] Amen.
[2045.44 → 2047.44] Amen.
[2075.44 → 2077.44] Amen.
[2105.44 → 2107.44] Amen.
[2107.44 → 2109.44] Hallelujah.
[2109.44 → 2111.44] Hallelujah.
[2111.44 → 2113.44] Hallelujah.
[2113.44 → 2115.44] Hallelujah.
[2117.44 → 2135.42] I would love to invite all the kids who are here up to the
[2135.42 → 2138.62] about kindergarten thereabouts, give or take.
[2138.62 → 2141.06] You can come and join me up at the front right now,
[2141.16 → 2143.32] and then we'll head off to children's worship time.
[2143.58 → 2145.44] So come on forward.
[2148.42 → 2149.18] There's more coming.
[2151.22 → 2152.04] Come on up.
[2152.12 → 2152.72] Come on up.
[2154.74 → 2155.96] Just a handful today.
[2156.02 → 2156.84] How's everybody doing?
[2157.70 → 2158.00] Good?
[2158.62 → 2160.00] Are you ready for children's worship time?
[2160.36 → 2160.80] Yeah?
[2161.26 → 2162.90] So we're going to do a little prayer,
[2163.04 → 2164.92] and then we'll head on off to the back, okay?
[2164.92 → 2166.90] Can you fold your hands and close your eyes?
[2167.28 → 2167.84] Here we go.
[2167.92 → 2168.40] Let's pray.
[2171.88 → 2173.90] Dear God, thank you so much for this day.
[2174.00 → 2175.08] Thank you that we could come to church
[2175.08 → 2177.54] and that we could learn more about you.
[2177.92 → 2180.44] Be with us now as we go to children's worship time
[2180.44 → 2182.70] or stay here in the sanctuary and open up the Bible
[2182.70 → 2185.02] and learn more about what it is you want to teach us.
[2185.12 → 2185.58] In your name.
[2185.96 → 2186.32] Amen.
[2187.54 → 2187.84] All right.
[2187.88 → 2188.56] We're going to stand up,
[2188.64 → 2191.32] and we're going to do the children's blessing together.
[2191.42 → 2191.86] So we're going to say,
[2191.86 → 2193.16] May the Lord be with you.
[2193.48 → 2193.78] All right?
[2193.82 → 2195.00] We're going to say it at the same time.
[2195.06 → 2195.52] Are you ready?
[2196.24 → 2197.56] One, two, three.
[2198.10 → 2200.16] The Lord be with you.
[2200.60 → 2202.06] Also with you.
[2202.68 → 2202.94] All right.
[2202.98 → 2203.68] You know where you're going.
[2203.68 → 2204.36] All right.
[2204.46 → 2206.16] We're going to be here.
[2206.54 → 2207.88] We're going to be here.
[2210.40 → 2218.72] We're going to go.
[2218.72 → 2231.66] Kevin, I was hoping for a story about the dog or with the dog.
[2232.26 → 2233.52] Got off easy this morning.
[2236.38 → 2237.78] Hi, my name is Dick.
[2237.98 → 2241.86] I'm on council here, and it is my turn to pray this morning.
[2243.48 → 2246.72] A lot happens the week before when it's a person's turn to pray.
[2246.72 → 2250.52] And if you don't believe that, just ask anybody who's on.
[2252.48 → 2255.86] This morning, I'm just going to read a list of concerns.
[2257.44 → 2262.12] And the one is thanks by Judy Dijkstra and her friend Vera.
[2263.12 → 2265.82] Vera is well and participating again.
[2267.68 → 2271.22] Our thoughts and prayers and hearts go out to Dale and Maria.
[2271.22 → 2277.46] They just found out that, well, just found out a while ago, Peter Reasons has colon cancer.
[2278.50 → 2280.78] And he's having major surgery on Tuesday.
[2280.94 → 2283.84] So if you would keep them in your prayers this week, especially on Tuesday.
[2285.34 → 2289.24] Mark and Dee's sister-in-law, Ashley, has breast cancer.
[2289.86 → 2293.16] She has an appointment this Thursday to determine next steps.
[2293.16 → 2297.22] IMO and Benita are still waiting for surgery.
[2297.64 → 2300.20] This time it's scheduled for the 9th.
[2302.20 → 2303.56] Pray for the shut-ins.
[2303.98 → 2307.28] People who, for various reasons, can't join us.
[2307.80 → 2311.26] And there's a whole host of people and a host of reasons.
[2312.72 → 2313.64] And then school.
[2314.66 → 2315.76] I want to remember school.
[2315.76 → 2318.00] September 1st is always a big day.
[2319.00 → 2326.14] I always question the grandkids if they're waiting to see, number one, who's in their class.
[2326.58 → 2328.84] Number two, who their teacher is.
[2328.96 → 2331.18] And sometimes that depends on how old they are.
[2331.58 → 2333.90] If they're grade one, two, kindergarten, it's pretty easy.
[2334.24 → 2334.82] They're not picky.
[2335.26 → 2336.20] They'll take any teacher.
[2336.76 → 2337.44] Get a little older.
[2337.72 → 2338.02] Well.
[2340.32 → 2341.36] And then church.
[2341.68 → 2342.80] This is a new year again.
[2343.58 → 2344.66] A lot of stuff starts.
[2344.66 → 2346.46] A lot of people are involved.
[2347.16 → 2349.86] A lot of people would really, really covet your prayers.
[2350.98 → 2358.64] When I'm up here praying, thinking about praying, it never ceases to amaze me how often Jesus,
[2359.14 → 2361.80] in the scriptures, took time out to pray.
[2362.52 → 2364.98] And if he needed it, so do we.
[2365.66 → 2368.36] And God invites each one of us.
[2368.36 → 2378.02] If you have time, and we probably all do a bit, just spend some time in prayer with our Lord and Saviour.
[2378.42 → 2378.96] Let's pray.
[2380.88 → 2382.62] Father, Lord in heaven, Lord, thank you.
[2383.64 → 2385.80] Another sunny, beautiful, beautiful day.
[2385.80 → 2393.94] Lord, we pray will you be with the people who are here in these pews, chairs.
[2394.54 → 2399.20] Lord, each one of us in Psalm 139, you knew us.
[2399.26 → 2399.94] You know us.
[2400.22 → 2401.42] You know what we think.
[2401.52 → 2405.66] You know what we want to say, what we don't say, what we do say, what we shouldn't say.
[2406.78 → 2409.82] Lord, you have every day mapped out for us.
[2409.82 → 2419.48] Lord, we pray will you help and guide us when we don't do or think or say appropriate things.
[2420.22 → 2421.56] Lord, school's coming up.
[2422.64 → 2423.74] Another new year.
[2424.22 → 2425.64] Some already are there.
[2426.66 → 2427.48] People travel.
[2428.86 → 2434.32] People travel every day when the kids come and go on the bus or in vehicles or whatever.
[2435.00 → 2436.06] Lord, we pray for safety.
[2436.06 → 2443.06] We pray for wisdom and health for teachers, for students, for anybody who's involved.
[2444.44 → 2449.90] Lord, we pray for our church, every single person involved in it.
[2450.90 → 2458.02] Lord, you know exactly who we are, where we are, what we do, what we should do.
[2459.06 → 2461.06] Lord, we ask you for strength and for wisdom.
[2462.08 → 2464.80] Lord, we also want to pray for the people we mentioned earlier.
[2466.06 → 2476.72] Lord, if they're shut in, if they're having a family member who needs surgery or have ailments or, Lord, whatever, you know.
[2476.82 → 2478.42] You know exactly what's needed.
[2479.12 → 2483.10] We pray, Lord, will you help us to spend time this week talking to you, Lord?
[2484.00 → 2485.08] And will you answer us?
[2485.66 → 2487.96] Lord, sometimes as we pray, we don't like the answers.
[2488.38 → 2489.50] Sometimes the answer is no.
[2489.96 → 2491.06] Sometimes the answer is wait.
[2491.06 → 2493.08] Sometimes the answer is yes.
[2493.68 → 2497.10] But, Lord, help us to seek you out, Lord.
[2497.24 → 2501.94] You have always looked after us and sought us out.
[2502.66 → 2508.28] Lord, this morning as we listen to your word, as Pastor Chris brings your word, give him clarity.
[2509.64 → 2511.18] Give him strength.
[2511.32 → 2511.86] Give him wisdom.
[2511.86 → 2521.16] We pray, Lord, give us open ears, open hearts, that we not only sit here and listen, but also go out and do.
[2522.12 → 2523.42] Thank you in Jesus' name.
[2523.60 → 2523.84] Amen.
[2523.84 → 2523.94] Amen.
[2523.94 → 2523.98] Amen.
[2523.98 → 2524.04] Amen.
[2524.04 → 2524.08] Amen.
[2524.08 → 2524.14] Amen.
[2524.14 → 2526.08] Amen.
[2526.08 → 2526.14] Amen.
[2526.14 → 2528.08] Amen.
[2528.08 → 2530.08] Amen.
[2541.86 → 2543.28] And we're going to have to talk about this summer together.
[2543.50 → 2548.26] We have been looking at stories from the early church.
[2548.40 → 2553.28] We've been kind of bouncing around in the book of Acts, looking at different themes through that.
[2553.36 → 2568.60] We're going to round out that story and that look at the book of Acts today by reading and hearing the last part of Paul's missionary work recorded in the book of Acts.
[2568.60 → 2579.44] his journey to Rome. We're going to read the last portion of that, chapter 28, starting at verse 11,
[2579.58 → 2585.18] and I'll read through. But we're really going to lean into the story side of things this morning,
[2585.30 → 2591.18] and so we're going to, after reading that, we'll start, and we'll back up and kind of hear the story
[2591.18 → 2598.24] of what got us to that. We have been, throughout this summer as well, giving out little clipboards.
[2598.24 → 2602.90] They're on the back at the Children's Worship Time booth there, where kids have the opportunity to
[2602.90 → 2608.36] draw pictures based on what they hear, and there are other crosswords and games and things in there.
[2608.96 → 2613.42] If you do draw a picture, we'd love to have that. We'd love to collect it. We're going to
[2613.42 → 2618.74] make a little art gallery wall next month with those collections of pictures there. So please,
[2619.22 → 2625.18] if you are moved to do that, make sure that it gets to the office or to myself after service today.
[2625.18 → 2632.94] Okay. Let's begin by reading together from Acts 28. We'll read starting at verse 11.
[2634.78 → 2639.56] If you have a Bible, I encourage you to open that up because we're going to be jumping around in the
[2639.56 → 2642.14] last book of Acts, the last part of the book of Acts together.
[2642.14 → 2653.30] After three months, we put out to sea in a ship that had wintered on the island. It was an
[2653.30 → 2660.00] Alexandrian ship with the figurehead of the twin gods Castor and Pollux. We put in at Syracuse and
[2660.00 → 2667.02] stayed there three days. From there, we set sail and arrived at Region. And the next day, the south wind
[2667.02 → 2672.82] came up and on the following day, we reached Petilil. There we found some brothers and sisters
[2672.82 → 2680.38] who invited us to spend a week with them. And so we came to Rome. The brothers and sisters there had
[2680.38 → 2685.94] heard that we were coming, and they travelled as far as the forum of Prius and the three taverns to meet
[2685.94 → 2692.08] us. At the sight of these people, Paul thanked God and was encouraged. And when we got to Rome,
[2692.08 → 2699.36] Paul was allowed to live by himself with a soldier to guard him. Three days later, he called together
[2699.36 → 2705.58] the local Jewish leaders. When they had assembled, Paul said to them, my brothers, although I have done
[2705.58 → 2711.94] nothing against our people or against the customs of our ancestors, I was arrested in Jerusalem and
[2711.94 → 2718.46] handed over to the Romans. They examined me and wanted to release me because I was not guilty of any
[2718.46 → 2726.50] crime deserving death. The Jews objected. So I was compelled to intend to, for I was compelled
[2726.50 → 2733.00] to make an appeal to Caesar. I certainly did not intend to bring any charge against my own people.
[2733.44 → 2739.60] For this reason, I have asked to see you and talk with you. It is because of the hope of Israel that I
[2739.60 → 2746.96] am bound with this chain. And they replied, we have not received any letters from Judea concerning you
[2746.96 → 2752.76] and none of our people who have come from there has reported or said anything bad about you. But we
[2752.76 → 2758.60] wanted to hear what your views are, for we know that people everywhere are talking against this sect.
[2759.88 → 2765.96] They arranged to meet Paul on a certain day and came in even larger numbers to the place where he
[2765.96 → 2772.02] was staying. He witnessed to them from morning till evening, explaining about the kingdom of God and
[2772.02 → 2778.54] from the law of Moses and from the prophets. He tried to persuade them about Jesus. Some were convinced
[2778.54 → 2784.44] by what he said, but others would not believe. They disagreed among themselves and began to leave
[2784.44 → 2791.90] Paul, leave after Paul had made this final statement. The Holy Spirit spoke the truth to your ancestors when
[2791.90 → 2799.18] he said through Isaiah the prophet, go to this people and say, you will be ever hearing, but never
[2799.18 → 2805.54] understanding. You will be ever seeing, but never perceiving. For this people's heart has become
[2805.54 → 2812.12] calloused. They hardly hear with their ears and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise, they might see
[2812.12 → 2817.96] with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn and I would heal them.
[2819.22 → 2826.22] Therefore, I want you to know that God's salvation has been sent to the Gentiles and they will listen.
[2826.22 → 2832.62] For two whole years, Paul stayed there in his own rented house and welcomed all who came to see him.
[2833.14 → 2839.28] He proclaimed the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness
[2839.28 → 2842.58] and without hindrance. This is the word of the Lord.
[2848.00 → 2856.10] And so like I said, this morning we're going to lean into the storytelling side of this series.
[2856.96 → 2862.96] But I want to do that with a purpose because Luke tells this story with a purpose, and so we're going to do the same.
[2863.34 → 2871.86] And my hope is that as we hear this story, what we will begin to see is the telling and the participating
[2871.86 → 2879.00] and the viewing of the unstoppable spread of the gospel despite obstacles.
[2879.00 → 2886.30] And that this happens right in the heart of the empire because of the mission of God and for his church.
[2887.36 → 2894.02] The unstoppable spread of the gospel despite obstacles because this is the mission of God and of his church.
[2894.02 → 2901.62] And part of what we read when we started was began with that little phrase, after three months.
[2902.36 → 2907.32] And so we know that we're picking up in the larger narrative here.
[2907.32 → 2912.90] And like we said, I want to lean back and come back into that larger narrative.
[2914.36 → 2919.00] So if you have a Bible, you can flip back and we'll follow along.
[2919.00 → 2928.12] Back in chapter 21, Paul has arrived in Jerusalem after his third missionary journey.
[2928.12 → 2937.46] And while he is back in Jerusalem, a group of Jewish men from Asia to the north saw Paul at the temple.
[2938.52 → 2941.88] And in seeing him and in recognizing him from his missionary journeys,
[2942.22 → 2945.58] they stir up the crowds in Jerusalem against him,
[2945.58 → 2949.86] saying that Paul has been teaching against the Jews,
[2949.94 → 2953.66] been teaching against their ancestors, against the law and the prophets.
[2954.08 → 2955.78] He's been teaching against the temple.
[2955.78 → 2960.58] And they accuse him actually of bringing Greeks into the temple,
[2960.82 → 2963.42] which was a faux pas, was not allowed to happen.
[2964.82 → 2971.18] And because of that, the crowd gets all worked up, and they go to grab him and to kill him.
[2971.18 → 2976.32] Now this is Roman-controlled and occupied Jerusalem.
[2976.74 → 2986.28] And so this frenzy reaches the commander of the Roman garrison that is stationed there and hears about it.
[2986.64 → 2990.48] And so he goes and intervenes and has Paul arrested.
[2991.90 → 2999.46] And he asks them and the crowds what had been done that this man, Paul, deserves death.
[2999.46 → 3002.12] And he couldn't get a straight answer from them.
[3002.64 → 3009.62] Now in part because, as you read it, the crowd was so raucous and loud that he couldn't make sense of what was going on.
[3010.50 → 3015.90] The commander ends up taking Paul back to the barracks to be beaten and interrogated.
[3016.80 → 3019.34] Now when there, Paul asks him,
[3020.12 → 3025.62] Can you do this to a Roman citizen without a trial to find him guilty?
[3025.62 → 3030.84] And when the commander hears that, he has no small amount of panic.
[3032.68 → 3034.72] Let me zoom out a little bit further.
[3035.78 → 3042.08] In the second century BC, so 250 years or so before this takes place,
[3042.60 → 3047.24] the Roman Republic established what's known as the Portion laws.
[3047.24 → 3051.32] Now these laws give all citizens of Rome,
[3051.32 → 3059.00] and now remember that's usually rooted in the male head of family and anyone related to him,
[3059.38 → 3063.82] but they give all citizens of Rome, including those who live in the provinces,
[3064.64 → 3068.52] the right of provocation in Latin.
[3068.52 → 3074.08] Now this right means the right to appeal to a higher governing authority
[3074.08 → 3084.76] and the right to not experience sort of abusive or barbaric forms of punishment or coercion.
[3085.18 → 3088.20] That is, they couldn't be beaten or flogged,
[3088.22 → 3092.96] and they couldn't be crucified without a trial, without a right to defend themselves.
[3092.96 → 3101.20] And this idea of the Portion law becomes so rooted in Roman identity
[3101.20 → 3109.10] that it is a mark of pride for the people of Rome to establish this and to talk about this.
[3109.18 → 3112.64] In fact, at the end of the first century,
[3113.20 → 3119.80] Cicero, who's a well-known statesman, a philosopher, and a lawyer,
[3119.80 → 3125.84] he writes and records in his book called In Serum,
[3125.96 → 3127.44] which means against Verus.
[3127.56 → 3129.82] Verus was the governor in Sicily at the time.
[3131.04 → 3136.06] In his recording of Verus' trial, he says this, he makes this speech.
[3136.16 → 3136.56] He goes,
[3136.56 → 3140.52] Does freedom, that precious thing, mean nothing?
[3141.38 → 3146.58] Nor the proud privileges of a Roman citizen, nor the Portion law?
[3146.58 → 3150.72] Have these come to mean so little in Sicily?
[3152.42 → 3158.90] Right, this is the proud tradition behind what Paul is appealing to in our story.
[3159.94 → 3162.92] Because of that, the Roman commander stops,
[3163.72 → 3167.26] and the next day he takes Paul back to the Sanhedrin,
[3168.12 → 3172.20] and they try to sort out all of what's going on.
[3172.88 → 3174.98] Now again, that doesn't go well,
[3174.98 → 3178.26] and the commander has to return Paul to the barracks.
[3179.76 → 3182.44] And while Paul is back in the barracks,
[3182.52 → 3184.68] this time Jesus appears to him.
[3185.68 → 3187.48] Now remember, Jesus has ascended,
[3188.02 → 3190.60] and so Paul is having a vision of Jesus,
[3190.60 → 3194.42] and Jesus speaks to him in Acts 23, verse 11,
[3194.52 → 3194.96] and he says,
[3195.34 → 3196.02] Take courage.
[3196.88 → 3199.34] As you have testified about me in Jerusalem,
[3199.80 → 3203.00] so you must also testify in Rome.
[3203.00 → 3206.98] Now it's here that I want to just pause for a minute in the story.
[3208.38 → 3210.16] Right, when Jesus says to Paul,
[3210.74 → 3211.78] You will testify,
[3212.60 → 3216.12] he's using the same Greek root word
[3216.12 → 3219.92] as when Jesus said to the disciples at the beginning of the book of Acts,
[3220.32 → 3223.52] You will be my witnesses in Judea and Samaria,
[3223.78 → 3225.04] and to the ends of the earth.
[3225.60 → 3229.20] Right, the word witnesses and testify share a root.
[3229.20 → 3235.42] And so there's a direct tie between the apostolic mission of the disciples to be witnesses
[3235.42 → 3239.22] and the apostolic mission of Paul as a witness.
[3240.24 → 3242.34] And all of this, right,
[3242.42 → 3247.34] is a fulfillment of a promise that God made long before.
[3248.22 → 3249.04] Because you see,
[3249.40 → 3250.94] behind the words of Jesus
[3250.94 → 3254.14] about being witnesses and testifying
[3254.14 → 3256.88] are the words of Isaiah 43.
[3258.12 → 3261.20] Isaiah 43, verse 8 through 12,
[3261.32 → 3262.46] says this.
[3262.52 → 3263.40] I think we have it on the screen.
[3263.54 → 3263.64] Yep.
[3265.52 → 3268.96] Lead out those who have eyes but are blind,
[3269.38 → 3270.90] who have ears but are deaf.
[3271.72 → 3273.52] All the nations gather together
[3273.52 → 3274.56] and the peoples assemble,
[3275.08 → 3277.68] which of their gods foretold this
[3277.68 → 3279.80] and proclaimed to us the former things?
[3279.80 → 3284.28] Let them bring in their witnesses to prove if they were right,
[3284.40 → 3286.68] so that others may hear and say it is true.
[3287.98 → 3291.28] You are my witnesses, declares the Lord,
[3291.34 → 3293.28] and my servant whom I have chosen,
[3293.64 → 3295.72] so that you may know and believe me
[3295.72 → 3298.08] and understand that I am he.
[3298.84 → 3300.80] Before me no God was formed,
[3300.90 → 3302.40] nor will there be one after me.
[3302.74 → 3304.76] I, even I, am the Lord,
[3304.84 → 3306.70] and apart from me there is no Saviour.
[3307.04 → 3309.34] I have revealed and saved and proclaimed.
[3309.78 → 3312.06] I am not some foreign God among you.
[3312.18 → 3314.80] You are my witnesses, declares the Lord,
[3315.06 → 3317.40] that I am God.
[3318.98 → 3320.50] Now notice what Isaiah is doing here
[3320.50 → 3323.16] and what God is doing through the prophet at this moment.
[3323.24 → 3326.16] He's setting up a courtroom drama, as it were.
[3327.08 → 3328.24] And he's saying, effectively,
[3328.68 → 3330.42] which of the gods of the other nations
[3330.42 → 3331.46] could let this happen?
[3331.76 → 3333.94] Which of the gods of other nations could intervene?
[3334.52 → 3334.66] Right?
[3334.66 → 3336.70] Tell those other gods to bring in their witnesses
[3336.70 → 3338.10] so that they can prove them right.
[3339.34 → 3341.34] Which of course, they don't do.
[3342.58 → 3344.72] Instead, the Lord says,
[3345.22 → 3347.92] you are my witnesses.
[3349.16 → 3352.26] You will give testimony that I am right.
[3353.12 → 3354.44] You will give testimony
[3354.44 → 3356.58] that what I have promised has come to pass.
[3356.98 → 3358.06] You will be a witness
[3358.06 → 3361.48] that those with blind eyes had them opened.
[3361.68 → 3362.50] You will be a witness
[3362.50 → 3364.24] that those with deaf ears
[3364.24 → 3365.72] have had them unstopped
[3365.72 → 3366.64] and they're able to hear.
[3366.90 → 3368.02] And he finishes by saying,
[3368.30 → 3370.06] you will be my witnesses
[3370.06 → 3372.76] that I am God.
[3374.36 → 3375.62] Paul's testifying,
[3375.80 → 3377.26] the disciples witnessing
[3377.26 → 3378.90] is to say,
[3379.18 → 3381.68] Jesus is God.
[3382.48 → 3384.18] Jesus is the Christ,
[3384.38 → 3385.10] the Messiah,
[3385.28 → 3386.26] the Son of Man,
[3386.32 → 3388.26] and the Saviour of nations.
[3388.26 → 3388.36] God's mission to the nations.
[3388.82 → 3390.56] God's mission to the world
[3390.56 → 3392.80] is for him to say to the nations,
[3392.94 → 3393.68] here I am.
[3395.54 → 3396.58] Here I am.
[3397.86 → 3399.28] And in the same way,
[3399.62 → 3401.82] the church's mission to the world
[3401.82 → 3405.22] is to say that he is God.
[3405.66 → 3407.94] That Jesus is God.
[3407.94 → 3407.98] God.
[3410.54 → 3411.02] Recently,
[3411.18 → 3413.12] I was listening to a podcast
[3413.12 → 3415.00] by Christopher Wright.
[3415.80 → 3417.26] He's a missiologies
[3417.26 → 3420.56] who really roots his understanding
[3420.56 → 3421.76] of the mission of the church
[3421.76 → 3424.18] and the grand story of God's mission
[3424.18 → 3425.84] as the primary way
[3425.84 → 3426.86] to understand the Bible
[3426.86 → 3428.14] and the work of God in the world.
[3428.92 → 3429.80] In the podcast,
[3430.46 → 3432.64] he mentions that the way
[3432.64 → 3435.80] most of us read the Bible
[3435.80 → 3437.68] is to read
[3437.68 → 3439.28] and then to ask,
[3439.64 → 3441.42] how does this apply to my life?
[3442.76 → 3443.00] Now,
[3443.42 → 3444.76] this isn't a bad question
[3444.76 → 3446.40] and this isn't a bad way
[3446.40 → 3447.42] in and of itself
[3447.42 → 3448.70] to read the Bible,
[3448.70 → 3450.40] but it does have the tendency
[3450.40 → 3453.86] to be sort of a self-focused way
[3453.86 → 3454.62] to read the Bible.
[3455.40 → 3455.60] Right?
[3455.64 → 3457.14] This sort of makes it about you
[3457.14 → 3458.70] and then whatever the Bible says
[3458.70 → 3460.38] is sort of tangential to you
[3460.38 → 3461.46] and then you've got to figure out
[3461.46 → 3462.46] how to incorporate it.
[3463.90 → 3464.32] Right?
[3464.32 → 3466.02] It ends with the kind of question
[3466.02 → 3467.60] of what should I be doing?
[3468.48 → 3468.84] Now, again,
[3469.00 → 3470.92] that's not a bad question,
[3471.64 → 3473.70] but there's also, I think,
[3474.06 → 3476.48] perhaps a more profound way
[3476.48 → 3478.06] to read the Bible.
[3478.86 → 3478.92] Right?
[3478.94 → 3481.32] Instead of asking,
[3481.66 → 3484.06] how do I apply this story to my life?
[3485.30 → 3486.62] We can ask,
[3487.16 → 3488.96] how do I apply my life
[3488.96 → 3490.62] to this story?
[3490.62 → 3493.10] Right?
[3493.18 → 3494.80] Right says that it's not so much
[3494.80 → 3496.08] about application
[3496.08 → 3498.46] as it is about implication.
[3500.04 → 3500.20] Right?
[3500.24 → 3503.00] How am I implicated in this narrative
[3503.00 → 3504.40] which is God's story?
[3504.92 → 3506.80] Where does my life fit
[3506.80 → 3508.80] in my little piece of time
[3508.80 → 3510.18] on this ball of rock
[3510.18 → 3511.20] hurtling through space?
[3511.40 → 3513.62] Where does my life fit
[3513.62 → 3514.82] in that story?
[3514.82 → 3517.38] And one of the implications
[3517.38 → 3518.86] of this story
[3518.86 → 3520.82] is that we join
[3520.82 → 3522.38] in God's mission
[3522.38 → 3523.86] to witness to Him.
[3524.50 → 3524.74] Right?
[3524.80 → 3526.22] We join in God's mission
[3526.22 → 3528.60] to witness to His own glory.
[3528.60 → 3530.26] We join in God's mission
[3530.26 → 3531.46] to have all creation
[3531.46 → 3532.32] joined together
[3532.32 → 3533.68] in worship of Him.
[3533.92 → 3535.64] We join as witnesses
[3535.64 → 3537.00] to say,
[3537.26 → 3538.92] Jesus is God.
[3538.92 → 3543.06] In joining God's mission then,
[3543.42 → 3544.86] we all of a sudden
[3544.86 → 3547.00] find in our lives
[3547.00 → 3548.84] meaning and significance
[3548.84 → 3549.84] and purpose
[3549.84 → 3551.88] because we found ourselves
[3551.88 → 3553.64] rooted in the story
[3553.64 → 3554.66] of God's mission
[3554.66 → 3556.36] throughout all time
[3556.36 → 3557.22] and space.
[3557.34 → 3558.56] We find ourselves part
[3558.56 → 3560.48] of this bigger story,
[3560.62 → 3561.70] bigger than we could ever
[3561.70 → 3562.68] have imagined,
[3562.90 → 3564.70] one that has been being written
[3564.70 → 3566.02] since before even
[3566.02 → 3567.06] the very creation
[3567.06 → 3568.10] of the world.
[3568.10 → 3569.98] That's the implication
[3569.98 → 3572.08] of joining God
[3572.08 → 3573.40] as a witness
[3573.40 → 3575.22] that you have
[3575.22 → 3576.16] a global,
[3576.76 → 3578.42] eternal purpose.
[3579.78 → 3581.28] And that's for you.
[3583.88 → 3585.08] That's part of why
[3585.08 → 3585.88] we root ourselves
[3585.88 → 3587.76] in this story.
[3591.06 → 3592.82] The story continues.
[3593.20 → 3593.84] Right in the story,
[3593.96 → 3594.86] Paul is transferred
[3594.86 → 3596.22] to Caesarea
[3596.22 → 3598.10] for trial under Felix.
[3598.84 → 3601.02] Felix is a Roman governor.
[3601.84 → 3602.84] And we know a fair bit
[3602.84 → 3603.58] about Felix
[3603.58 → 3604.64] from other sources.
[3605.28 → 3605.92] For instance,
[3606.04 → 3606.90] we know that he
[3606.90 → 3608.12] treated his subjects
[3608.12 → 3609.06] with disdain.
[3609.54 → 3610.32] We know that he was
[3610.32 → 3611.04] often brutal
[3611.04 → 3612.76] and violent with them.
[3613.06 → 3614.10] So much so
[3614.10 → 3615.28] that Rome actually
[3615.28 → 3616.42] recalled him
[3616.42 → 3617.92] back to Rome
[3617.92 → 3618.74] from his post
[3618.74 → 3619.74] in AD 59
[3619.74 → 3622.06] because of constant complaints
[3622.06 → 3623.18] that the people
[3623.18 → 3623.72] under him,
[3623.78 → 3624.32] his subjects,
[3624.44 → 3625.12] the Jewish people,
[3625.12 → 3625.44] made.
[3626.30 → 3627.16] And that means
[3627.16 → 3628.08] it must have been
[3628.08 → 3628.80] pretty harsh.
[3629.30 → 3629.88] It must have been
[3629.88 → 3630.48] pretty bad
[3630.48 → 3631.84] for even the Romans
[3631.84 → 3632.28] to go,
[3632.48 → 3633.54] that's a bridge
[3633.54 → 3634.18] too far,
[3634.62 → 3634.84] Felix.
[3636.48 → 3637.66] We know also
[3637.66 → 3638.56] that he was corrupt.
[3639.34 → 3640.22] Luke even tells us
[3640.22 → 3640.84] that the reason
[3640.84 → 3642.00] he kept Paul
[3642.00 → 3642.88] for two years
[3642.88 → 3643.38] in prison
[3643.38 → 3644.08] is because he was
[3644.08 → 3644.84] hoping that Paul
[3644.84 → 3645.30] would give him
[3645.30 → 3645.80] a bribe.
[3645.80 → 3648.50] So for two years
[3648.50 → 3649.60] Felix kept him
[3649.60 → 3651.00] until Felix
[3651.00 → 3651.70] is recalled
[3651.70 → 3653.24] and he's replaced
[3653.24 → 3654.14] by Festus,
[3654.70 → 3655.58] another governor.
[3656.32 → 3656.88] Now the Jews
[3656.88 → 3658.04] conspire with Festus
[3658.04 → 3658.84] to transfer Paul
[3658.84 → 3659.68] back to Jerusalem
[3659.68 → 3661.08] because they have
[3661.08 → 3662.32] a plot to kill him
[3662.32 → 3663.34] while on the way.
[3664.10 → 3665.12] And it's at this point
[3665.12 → 3666.06] that Paul again
[3666.06 → 3667.78] appeals to Caesar.
[3668.82 → 3669.76] Caesar is the title
[3669.76 → 3670.30] of the emperor
[3670.30 → 3670.80] in Rome.
[3671.04 → 3671.70] At this time
[3671.70 → 3672.48] it would have been Nero.
[3672.48 → 3674.32] because of Paul's
[3674.32 → 3674.84] citizenship,
[3675.44 → 3676.78] Festus has no choice
[3676.78 → 3677.82] but to agree.
[3678.14 → 3678.64] And he says
[3678.64 → 3679.40] in Acts 25,
[3679.68 → 3680.42] you have appealed
[3680.42 → 3681.02] to Caesar,
[3681.60 → 3682.70] to Caesar you will go.
[3684.68 → 3685.36] And so while he's
[3685.36 → 3686.16] waiting to go
[3686.16 → 3687.16] before he can go
[3687.16 → 3687.96] to Caesar,
[3688.22 → 3689.30] Festus invites
[3689.30 → 3690.26] King Agrippa.
[3691.12 → 3693.26] This is Agrippa II
[3693.26 → 3694.46] who's the great
[3694.46 → 3696.14] grandson of Herod the Great.
[3696.28 → 3697.40] If you know
[3697.40 → 3698.00] the story
[3698.00 → 3698.82] of the birth
[3698.82 → 3699.38] of Jesus,
[3699.56 → 3700.28] Herod the Great
[3700.28 → 3701.02] is the one
[3701.02 → 3701.64] who was ruling
[3701.64 → 3702.20] at the time
[3702.20 → 3703.36] of Jesus' birth.
[3704.22 → 3704.98] Agrippa II
[3704.98 → 3706.28] was only a boy
[3706.28 → 3707.24] when his father,
[3707.48 → 3708.74] Agrippa I,
[3709.26 → 3709.88] died.
[3710.50 → 3712.04] And so because of that
[3712.04 → 3713.20] the Romans divided
[3713.20 → 3714.58] his rule
[3714.58 → 3715.80] up under these governors.
[3715.98 → 3716.58] That's why we have
[3716.58 → 3717.54] Felix and Festus
[3717.54 → 3718.24] in this story.
[3718.82 → 3720.56] But as Agrippa grew older
[3720.56 → 3721.76] he managed to get
[3721.76 → 3722.62] more and more
[3722.62 → 3724.18] rule and authority
[3724.18 → 3725.98] back from Rome
[3725.98 → 3727.72] though never Judea proper,
[3728.24 → 3729.68] rather regions to the north.
[3730.34 → 3731.50] But he does manage
[3731.50 → 3732.72] this place of influence
[3732.72 → 3733.58] with them.
[3734.92 → 3735.56] Now Paul
[3735.56 → 3736.42] is given a chance
[3736.42 → 3737.00] to preach
[3737.00 → 3737.76] to Festus
[3737.76 → 3738.60] and to Agrippa
[3738.60 → 3740.04] and Bernice.
[3740.22 → 3741.36] Bernice is Agrippa's
[3741.36 → 3741.92] sister
[3741.92 → 3743.66] and also
[3743.66 → 3744.78] his rumoured
[3744.78 → 3745.50] consort.
[3747.28 → 3748.54] But Paul preaches
[3748.54 → 3749.54] to this group
[3749.54 → 3750.48] along with a number
[3750.48 → 3751.24] of other leaders
[3751.24 → 3752.62] from the Sanhedrin.
[3753.36 → 3754.00] Now honestly
[3754.00 → 3755.96] these chapters
[3755.96 → 3757.28] from 23 to 27
[3757.28 → 3758.68] are an amazing read
[3758.68 → 3759.66] and if you're looking
[3759.66 → 3760.48] for some devotional
[3760.48 → 3761.22] reading for this week
[3761.22 → 3761.84] I encourage you
[3761.84 → 3762.84] to dig into this
[3762.84 → 3763.58] and to go here.
[3765.14 → 3766.06] Because Paul preaches
[3766.06 → 3767.84] these really moving sermons
[3767.84 → 3769.10] and at the end
[3769.10 → 3769.84] of preaching
[3769.84 → 3770.70] to this group
[3770.70 → 3771.76] that includes Agrippa
[3771.76 → 3773.46] Agrippa stands up
[3773.46 → 3773.86] and he says
[3773.86 → 3774.86] do you think
[3774.86 → 3776.22] that in such a short time
[3776.22 → 3777.80] you can persuade me
[3777.80 → 3778.56] to be a Christian?
[3779.36 → 3780.48] To which Paul
[3780.48 → 3781.64] gives this really
[3781.64 → 3782.62] awesome
[3782.62 → 3784.10] baller answer.
[3784.66 → 3785.08] He says
[3785.08 → 3785.98] short time
[3785.98 → 3786.42] are long
[3786.42 → 3787.76] I pray that
[3787.76 → 3788.48] not only you
[3788.48 → 3790.00] but all who are
[3790.00 → 3791.04] listening to me today
[3791.04 → 3792.28] become what I am
[3792.28 → 3794.08] except for these chains.
[3795.34 → 3796.56] Now I love this answer
[3796.56 → 3797.04] and I want us
[3797.04 → 3798.34] to key in on it
[3798.34 → 3799.74] because of course
[3799.74 → 3800.98] Paul wants everyone
[3800.98 → 3801.84] who hears him
[3801.84 → 3802.88] to be like him.
[3803.72 → 3804.70] The truth that he's
[3804.70 → 3805.20] proclaiming
[3805.20 → 3806.18] is not only the key
[3806.18 → 3807.04] to salvation
[3807.04 → 3808.90] this gospel truth
[3808.90 → 3810.12] is the key to history.
[3810.94 → 3811.66] It's the key
[3811.66 → 3812.56] to making sense
[3812.56 → 3813.32] of the whole world.
[3813.92 → 3814.42] It's the key
[3814.42 → 3815.26] to understanding
[3815.26 → 3815.88] your place
[3815.88 → 3816.82] in God's mission.
[3817.66 → 3818.56] Jesus says
[3818.56 → 3819.64] that the only way
[3819.64 → 3820.58] to bear fruit
[3820.58 → 3821.14] the only way
[3821.14 → 3821.72] to bear fruit
[3821.72 → 3822.60] that will last
[3822.60 → 3823.48] the only way
[3823.48 → 3824.14] to do something
[3824.14 → 3824.72] meaningful
[3824.72 → 3825.80] and purposeful
[3825.80 → 3826.74] that is with God
[3826.74 → 3828.02] glorifying ends
[3828.02 → 3828.82] the only way
[3828.82 → 3829.24] to do that
[3829.24 → 3830.16] is to be connected
[3830.16 → 3830.72] to him
[3830.72 → 3832.26] to abide in him.
[3833.04 → 3834.22] There's no other name
[3834.22 → 3834.78] in heaven
[3834.78 → 3835.84] or on earth
[3835.84 → 3836.50] by which man
[3836.50 → 3837.16] can be saved.
[3837.70 → 3838.36] No one comes
[3838.36 → 3838.92] to the Father
[3838.92 → 3840.44] except by him.
[3841.34 → 3842.28] It is his life
[3842.28 → 3843.26] in our place
[3843.26 → 3843.98] and his death
[3843.98 → 3844.76] on the cross
[3844.76 → 3846.28] that reconciles
[3846.28 → 3846.74] us to God
[3846.74 → 3847.46] that draws us
[3847.46 → 3848.66] back to who God
[3848.66 → 3848.92] is.
[3849.24 → 3850.32] And being united
[3850.32 → 3851.06] with Jesus
[3851.06 → 3851.84] by grace
[3851.84 → 3852.52] through faith
[3852.52 → 3853.58] is finally
[3853.58 → 3854.36] what it means
[3854.36 → 3856.00] to be fully human
[3856.00 → 3857.24] fully alive
[3857.24 → 3857.96] finally
[3857.96 → 3859.44] and fully alive
[3859.44 → 3860.10] to the glory
[3860.10 → 3860.64] of God.
[3861.94 → 3863.02] Anything less
[3863.02 → 3863.64] than that
[3863.64 → 3865.20] isn't just inadequate
[3865.20 → 3867.62] it's actually
[3867.62 → 3868.70] inhuman.
[3868.70 → 3871.94] it's not enough
[3871.94 → 3875.08] and when we gather
[3875.08 → 3875.76] here week
[3875.76 → 3876.36] after week
[3876.36 → 3876.94] after week
[3876.94 → 3878.10] it's not out
[3878.10 → 3878.60] of ritual
[3878.60 → 3879.26] or custom
[3879.26 → 3879.88] or at least
[3879.88 → 3880.70] it's not just
[3880.70 → 3881.42] out of ritual
[3881.42 → 3882.52] or just out
[3882.52 → 3883.00] of custom
[3883.00 → 3884.26] it's so that
[3884.26 → 3885.04] we can learn
[3885.04 → 3885.74] what it really
[3885.74 → 3886.64] means to be
[3886.64 → 3887.28] human
[3887.28 → 3888.92] to find our
[3888.92 → 3889.38] place
[3889.38 → 3890.50] in the story
[3890.50 → 3891.28] as witnesses
[3891.28 → 3892.68] of God's mission
[3892.68 → 3894.66] and that
[3894.66 → 3895.62] to me
[3895.62 → 3896.72] is a
[3896.72 → 3897.30] worthwhile
[3897.30 → 3898.68] purpose.
[3902.20 → 3903.36] And so we see
[3903.36 → 3904.14] this gospel
[3904.14 → 3905.88] story
[3905.88 → 3907.58] spreading
[3907.58 → 3910.56] and while
[3910.56 → 3911.08] Festus
[3911.08 → 3911.72] and Agrippa
[3911.72 → 3912.44] may not have
[3912.44 → 3913.32] professed faith
[3913.32 → 3914.72] at that moment
[3914.72 → 3915.98] Agrippa does
[3915.98 → 3917.14] turn to Festus
[3917.14 → 3917.88] and he says
[3917.88 → 3919.16] if he hadn't
[3919.16 → 3919.96] appealed to Caesar
[3919.96 → 3921.12] we could have
[3921.12 → 3921.60] let him free
[3921.60 → 3923.92] but instead
[3923.92 → 3925.48] they set sail
[3925.48 → 3925.94] for Rome.
[3928.00 → 3929.22] Now in route
[3929.22 → 3931.06] a major storm
[3931.06 → 3931.94] comes up
[3931.94 → 3932.48] while they're
[3932.48 → 3932.86] sailing
[3932.86 → 3934.28] Luke describes
[3934.28 → 3935.36] it in Acts 17
[3935.36 → 3936.10] verse 14
[3936.10 → 3936.82] as a wind
[3936.82 → 3937.68] of hurricane
[3937.68 → 3938.26] force.
[3939.02 → 3939.54] The word
[3939.54 → 3940.72] used there
[3940.72 → 3941.48] is the one
[3941.48 → 3941.92] that we get
[3941.92 → 3942.34] the English
[3942.34 → 3943.22] word typhoon
[3943.22 → 3943.66] from.
[3944.30 → 3944.82] So it's a big
[3944.82 → 3945.12] storm.
[3946.24 → 3946.62] The ship
[3946.62 → 3947.34] is wrecked
[3947.34 → 3948.22] on the island
[3948.22 → 3949.34] of Malta.
[3950.00 → 3950.66] Malta is
[3950.66 → 3951.42] south of
[3951.42 → 3952.06] Sicily.
[3952.72 → 3953.64] Sicily is
[3953.64 → 3954.48] that landmass
[3954.48 → 3955.10] that the boot
[3955.10 → 3955.56] of Italy
[3955.56 → 3956.08] is kicking.
[3956.88 → 3957.32] So south
[3957.32 → 3957.78] of that
[3957.78 → 3958.20] is where
[3958.20 → 3958.56] the island
[3958.56 → 3958.96] of Malta
[3958.96 → 3959.22] is.
[3960.26 → 3960.74] There
[3960.74 → 3961.44] Paul
[3961.44 → 3962.56] is miraculously
[3962.56 → 3964.82] he miraculously
[3964.82 → 3965.50] survives
[3965.50 → 3966.26] a snake bite
[3966.26 → 3967.72] and the people
[3967.72 → 3968.30] think that
[3968.30 → 3968.94] he must be
[3968.94 → 3969.36] a god.
[3970.14 → 3970.78] It's the same
[3970.78 → 3971.38] sort of thing
[3971.38 → 3971.94] that happened
[3971.94 → 3972.86] when Paul
[3972.86 → 3973.58] was in Lustra
[3973.58 → 3974.76] when people
[3974.76 → 3975.26] thought he
[3975.26 → 3975.96] and Barnabas
[3975.96 → 3976.52] were Hermes
[3976.52 → 3976.98] and Zeus.
[3977.34 → 3978.50] Now the chief
[3978.50 → 3979.38] official of
[3979.38 → 3980.36] the island
[3980.36 → 3981.16] the first
[3981.16 → 3981.60] man
[3981.60 → 3982.42] the photos
[3982.42 → 3982.88] it says
[3982.88 → 3983.36] in Greek
[3983.36 → 3984.66] which coincidentally
[3984.66 → 3985.50] is a title
[3985.50 → 3986.60] that archaeologists
[3986.60 → 3987.20] have actually
[3987.20 → 3988.32] found in the
[3988.32 → 3989.14] historical record
[3989.14 → 3989.80] on the island
[3989.80 → 3990.28] of Malta.
[3991.64 → 3992.64] The chief
[3992.64 → 3993.70] man invites
[3993.70 → 3994.38] them into
[3994.38 → 3994.98] his home
[3994.98 → 3995.78] and while
[3995.78 → 3996.44] there his
[3996.44 → 3997.28] father gets
[3997.28 → 3998.00] really sick
[3998.00 → 3999.18] and Paul
[3999.18 → 3999.96] heals him
[3999.96 → 4001.24] and so this
[4001.24 → 4002.08] news spreads
[4002.08 → 4002.64] throughout the
[4002.64 → 4003.32] island of Malta
[4003.32 → 4004.18] that there is
[4004.18 → 4004.90] a man on
[4004.90 → 4005.20] the island
[4005.20 → 4005.70] who heals
[4005.70 → 4006.18] the sick
[4006.18 → 4006.52] and so
[4006.52 → 4007.12] all the
[4007.12 → 4007.92] islanders
[4007.92 → 4008.58] bring the
[4008.58 → 4008.86] sick
[4008.86 → 4009.80] to Paul
[4009.80 → 4010.28] and they're
[4010.28 → 4010.64] cured.
[4011.84 → 4012.04] In fact
[4012.04 → 4012.52] tradition
[4012.52 → 4013.10] goes on
[4013.10 → 4013.54] to say
[4013.54 → 4014.36] that the
[4014.36 → 4014.92] photos
[4014.92 → 4015.46] this first
[4015.46 → 4015.74] man
[4015.74 → 4016.18] this leading
[4016.18 → 4016.60] official
[4016.60 → 4017.44] becomes
[4017.44 → 4018.02] the first
[4018.02 → 4018.44] bishop
[4018.44 → 4019.06] of Malta.
[4020.72 → 4021.76] Many believed
[4021.76 → 4022.48] and were added
[4022.48 → 4022.84] to their
[4022.84 → 4023.18] number.
[4024.86 → 4025.12] And again
[4025.12 → 4025.52] in fact
[4025.52 → 4026.24] archaeologists
[4026.24 → 4026.94] have found
[4026.94 → 4027.98] very early
[4027.98 → 4028.46] Christian
[4028.46 → 4029.16] presence
[4029.16 → 4030.02] on the
[4030.02 → 4030.58] island of Malta
[4030.58 → 4030.96] in the
[4030.96 → 4031.70] catacombs
[4031.70 → 4031.98] that are
[4031.98 → 4032.28] underneath
[4035.70 → 4035.74] Rome
[4035.74 → 4036.46] and in
[4036.46 → 4036.80] Sicily.
[4038.50 → 4039.10] And so
[4039.10 → 4039.42] they're there
[4039.42 → 4039.80] for three
[4039.80 → 4040.06] months
[4040.06 → 4040.80] and finally
[4040.80 → 4041.90] after three
[4041.90 → 4042.28] months
[4042.28 → 4043.96] that's after
[4043.96 → 4044.34] the winter
[4044.34 → 4044.94] storms
[4044.94 → 4046.06] they set
[4046.06 → 4046.40] sail
[4046.40 → 4048.26] which gets
[4048.26 → 4048.64] us caught
[4048.64 → 4049.08] up to
[4049.08 → 4050.12] our portion
[4050.12 → 4050.40] of the
[4050.40 → 4050.74] story
[4050.74 → 4051.24] the part
[4051.24 → 4051.48] that we
[4051.48 → 4051.74] read.
[4052.62 → 4053.06] And that
[4053.06 → 4053.78] first part
[4053.78 → 4054.12] that we
[4054.12 → 4054.42] read
[4054.42 → 4054.80] in verses
[4054.80 → 4055.26] 11 to
[4055.26 → 4055.62] 15
[4055.62 → 4056.16] reads
[4056.16 → 4056.72] kind of
[4056.72 → 4057.08] like a
[4057.08 → 4057.42] travel
[4057.42 → 4057.78] journal
[4057.78 → 4058.36] right
[4058.36 → 4059.06] with Luke
[4059.06 → 4059.46] giving
[4059.46 → 4060.44] very particular
[4060.44 → 4061.60] details.
[4062.22 → 4063.06] But again
[4063.06 → 4063.60] if we
[4063.60 → 4064.10] have the
[4064.10 → 4064.52] ears to
[4064.52 → 4064.72] hear
[4064.72 → 4065.46] we've seen
[4065.46 → 4066.80] Luke doing
[4066.80 → 4067.62] this throughout.
[4068.64 → 4069.36] Luke is a
[4069.36 → 4070.00] doctor by
[4070.00 → 4070.56] profession
[4070.56 → 4071.66] but he is
[4071.66 → 4072.64] a historian
[4072.64 → 4073.68] for the
[4073.68 → 4074.16] mission of
[4074.16 → 4074.46] God.
[4075.44 → 4075.78] And his
[4075.78 → 4076.42] point here
[4076.42 → 4077.10] is to be
[4077.10 → 4077.50] writing
[4077.50 → 4078.44] history.
[4079.36 → 4079.68] Now of
[4079.68 → 4080.10] course he
[4080.10 → 4080.80] writes history
[4080.80 → 4081.68] with a
[4081.68 → 4082.06] preaching
[4082.06 → 4082.66] purpose.
[4082.80 → 4083.20] That he's
[4083.20 → 4083.76] telling the
[4083.76 → 4084.68] story because
[4084.68 → 4085.14] he wants
[4085.14 → 4085.62] people to
[4085.62 → 4086.10] know the
[4086.10 → 4086.86] truth of
[4086.86 → 4087.34] the gospel.
[4088.74 → 4089.06] And in
[4089.06 → 4090.02] fact in
[4090.02 → 4090.50] the opening
[4090.50 → 4091.06] of the
[4091.06 → 4091.66] gospel of
[4091.66 → 4092.10] Luke he
[4092.10 → 4092.62] gives this
[4092.62 → 4093.02] purpose
[4093.02 → 4093.72] explicitly.
[4093.88 → 4094.18] He says
[4094.18 → 4094.60] in Luke
[4094.60 → 4094.92] 1
[4094.92 → 4096.10] I have
[4096.10 → 4096.80] decided to
[4096.80 → 4097.22] write an
[4097.22 → 4097.66] orderly
[4097.66 → 4098.34] account for
[4098.34 → 4099.42] you so
[4099.42 → 4099.98] that you
[4099.98 → 4100.64] may know
[4100.64 → 4101.52] the certainty
[4101.52 → 4102.32] of the
[4102.32 → 4102.98] things you
[4102.98 → 4103.58] have been
[4103.58 → 4104.06] taught.
[4105.50 → 4106.66] This story
[4106.66 → 4107.50] is told
[4107.50 → 4109.48] and given
[4109.48 → 4110.30] to us
[4110.30 → 4111.52] so that
[4111.52 → 4112.34] you can
[4112.34 → 4112.94] know the
[4112.94 → 4113.32] truth.
[4114.16 → 4114.36] And so
[4114.36 → 4114.62] that you
[4114.62 → 4114.94] can not
[4114.94 → 4115.70] just know
[4115.70 → 4116.38] it but
[4116.38 → 4116.70] so that
[4116.70 → 4116.96] it can
[4116.96 → 4117.74] be certain
[4117.74 → 4118.74] for you.
[4118.96 → 4119.36] So that
[4119.36 → 4119.76] you can
[4119.76 → 4120.20] know that
[4120.20 → 4120.84] your faith
[4120.84 → 4121.50] isn't just
[4121.50 → 4122.06] built on
[4122.06 → 4123.02] myths but
[4123.02 → 4123.32] on the
[4123.32 → 4124.32] testimony of
[4124.32 → 4124.92] tested
[4124.92 → 4125.72] witnesses.
[4127.50 → 4128.80] This is
[4128.80 → 4129.82] what God's
[4129.82 → 4131.02] word becomes
[4131.02 → 4132.14] for us.
[4132.44 → 4133.24] The testimony
[4133.24 → 4134.24] of tested
[4134.24 → 4135.50] witnesses and
[4135.50 → 4136.50] the firm
[4136.50 → 4138.04] foundation of
[4138.04 → 4139.42] our faith,
[4139.50 → 4139.96] of the
[4139.96 → 4140.82] things that
[4140.82 → 4141.58] we profess
[4141.58 → 4142.76] to believe.
[4144.76 → 4145.94] In this
[4145.94 → 4146.62] series we've
[4146.62 → 4146.96] been holding
[4146.96 → 4147.62] up stories
[4147.62 → 4148.50] from the
[4148.50 → 4149.40] early church.
[4149.40 → 4150.22] Jerome
[4150.22 → 4151.06] at the
[4151.06 → 4151.38] end of
[4151.38 → 4151.52] the
[4151.52 → 4151.80] fourth
[4151.80 → 4152.58] century.
[4153.64 → 4154.02] Jerome
[4154.02 → 4154.58] is most
[4154.58 → 4155.56] known for
[4155.56 → 4156.24] translating
[4156.24 → 4157.72] the Bible
[4157.72 → 4158.44] into
[4158.44 → 4159.08] Latin,
[4159.30 → 4159.82] into what
[4159.82 → 4160.14] we call
[4160.14 → 4160.90] the Vulgate
[4160.90 → 4161.44] as a way
[4161.44 → 4161.84] of spreading
[4161.84 → 4162.34] it around
[4162.34 → 4163.44] the empire.
[4164.32 → 4164.98] He writes
[4164.98 → 4165.96] in his
[4165.96 → 4166.86] preface to
[4166.86 → 4167.58] the commentary
[4167.58 → 4168.62] on Isaiah
[4168.62 → 4169.22] he says
[4169.22 → 4170.36] for if
[4170.36 → 4171.12] according to
[4171.12 → 4171.62] the apostle
[4171.62 → 4172.08] Paul
[4172.08 → 4172.72] Christ is
[4172.72 → 4173.20] the power
[4173.20 → 4173.74] of God
[4173.74 → 4174.02] and the
[4174.02 → 4174.30] wisdom
[4174.30 → 4174.82] of God
[4174.82 → 4175.20] and that's
[4175.20 → 4175.46] from
[4175.46 → 4175.72] first
[4175.72 → 4176.14] Corinthians
[4176.14 → 4177.68] and the
[4177.68 → 4178.14] one who
[4178.14 → 4178.62] does not
[4178.62 → 4178.98] know the
[4178.98 → 4179.30] scriptures
[4179.30 → 4179.86] does not
[4179.86 → 4180.20] know the
[4180.20 → 4180.84] power of
[4180.84 → 4181.40] God and
[4181.40 → 4182.02] his wisdom
[4182.02 → 4183.06] then
[4183.06 → 4183.82] ignorance
[4183.82 → 4184.44] of the
[4184.44 → 4184.86] scriptures
[4184.86 → 4185.74] is
[4185.74 → 4186.26] ignorance
[4186.26 → 4187.22] of
[4187.22 → 4188.20] Christ.
[4191.26 → 4192.16] This
[4192.16 → 4192.64] word
[4192.64 → 4194.86] God's
[4194.86 → 4195.20] word
[4195.20 → 4196.96] is
[4196.96 → 4198.02] a firm
[4198.02 → 4198.82] foundation
[4198.82 → 4200.24] for your
[4200.24 → 4200.76] faith
[4200.76 → 4201.86] because
[4201.86 → 4202.94] this is
[4202.94 → 4203.74] the revelation
[4203.74 → 4204.64] of God
[4204.64 → 4205.56] for his
[4205.56 → 4205.92] people.
[4205.92 → 4206.24] It is
[4206.24 → 4206.94] here
[4206.94 → 4208.28] in the
[4208.28 → 4208.72] beginning
[4208.72 → 4209.82] and
[4209.82 → 4211.32] throughout
[4211.32 → 4212.80] that we
[4212.80 → 4213.18] meet
[4213.18 → 4214.44] Jesus.
[4216.24 → 4216.74] Finding
[4216.74 → 4217.68] your place
[4217.68 → 4218.82] in this
[4218.82 → 4219.52] story
[4219.52 → 4220.38] is finding
[4220.38 → 4221.18] your place
[4221.18 → 4221.54] in the
[4221.54 → 4221.80] mission
[4221.80 → 4222.44] of God
[4222.44 → 4223.58] as his
[4223.58 → 4224.28] witness
[4224.28 → 4224.76] and as
[4224.76 → 4225.08] witness
[4225.08 → 4225.56] to the
[4225.56 → 4225.90] truth
[4225.90 → 4226.90] of this
[4226.90 → 4227.74] story
[4227.74 → 4228.20] and that
[4228.20 → 4228.82] I think
[4228.82 → 4229.24] is the
[4229.24 → 4229.92] beautiful
[4229.92 → 4230.64] interchange
[4230.64 → 4231.24] between
[4231.24 → 4231.46] the
[4231.46 → 4231.84] biblical
[4231.84 → 4232.72] witness
[4232.72 → 4233.80] and you
[4233.80 → 4234.24] as
[4234.24 → 4234.90] witness
[4234.90 → 4235.18] right
[4235.18 → 4235.58] you
[4235.58 → 4236.00] and
[4236.00 → 4236.46] God's
[4236.46 → 4236.90] word
[4236.90 → 4237.46] God's
[4237.46 → 4238.02] image
[4238.02 → 4238.86] and his
[4238.86 → 4239.68] word.
[4240.62 → 4241.14] There's
[4241.14 → 4241.76] a beautiful
[4241.76 → 4242.18] quote
[4242.18 → 4243.22] from
[4243.22 → 4243.72] Leslie
[4243.72 → 4244.22] New begin.
[4244.34 → 4244.62] Leslie
[4244.62 → 4245.18] New begin is
[4245.18 → 4246.72] a British
[4246.72 → 4247.26] missionary
[4247.26 → 4247.92] to India
[4247.92 → 4248.38] and
[4248.38 → 4249.30] basically
[4249.30 → 4250.22] the father
[4250.22 → 4250.82] of modern
[4250.82 → 4251.46] missiology.
[4251.46 → 4253.04] he says
[4253.04 → 4255.32] how is it
[4255.32 → 4255.80] possible
[4255.80 → 4256.66] that the
[4256.66 → 4257.06] gospel
[4257.06 → 4257.62] should be
[4257.62 → 4258.02] credible
[4258.02 → 4259.34] that people
[4259.34 → 4259.82] should come
[4259.82 → 4260.40] to believe
[4260.40 → 4260.86] that the
[4260.86 → 4261.28] power
[4261.28 → 4261.96] which has
[4261.96 → 4262.52] the last
[4262.52 → 4262.98] word in
[4262.98 → 4263.68] human affairs
[4263.68 → 4264.46] is represented
[4264.46 → 4265.22] by a man
[4265.22 → 4265.90] hanging on
[4265.90 → 4266.42] a cross.
[4267.82 → 4268.84] The only
[4268.84 → 4269.34] answer
[4269.34 → 4270.50] the only
[4270.50 → 4271.10] hermeneutic
[4271.10 → 4271.36] of the
[4271.36 → 4271.70] gospel
[4271.70 → 4272.56] is a
[4272.56 → 4273.08] congregation
[4273.08 → 4273.88] of men
[4273.88 → 4274.80] and women
[4274.80 → 4275.58] who believe
[4275.58 → 4275.82] it
[4275.82 → 4277.00] and live
[4277.00 → 4277.62] by it.
[4277.62 → 4280.96] How is it
[4280.96 → 4281.46] possible
[4281.46 → 4282.40] that the
[4282.40 → 4283.02] truth of
[4283.02 → 4283.48] this word
[4283.48 → 4283.80] that the
[4283.80 → 4284.34] truth of
[4284.34 → 4285.10] Jesus Christ
[4285.10 → 4285.74] as he
[4285.74 → 4286.32] has revealed
[4286.32 → 4286.76] to us
[4286.76 → 4287.28] how is it
[4287.28 → 4287.68] possible
[4287.68 → 4288.32] that the
[4288.32 → 4288.68] truth
[4288.68 → 4289.34] that the
[4289.34 → 4290.26] only way
[4290.26 → 4290.68] that we
[4290.68 → 4291.14] can be
[4291.14 → 4291.76] reconciled
[4291.76 → 4292.18] to God
[4292.18 → 4292.50] is by
[4292.50 → 4293.00] the life
[4293.00 → 4293.88] and death
[4293.88 → 4294.44] of Jesus
[4294.44 → 4295.02] how is it
[4295.02 → 4295.36] possible
[4295.36 → 4295.76] that this
[4295.76 → 4296.28] crazy
[4296.28 → 4297.06] absurd
[4297.06 → 4297.40] thing
[4297.40 → 4297.84] that happened
[4297.84 → 4298.42] 2,000
[4298.42 → 4299.02] years ago
[4299.02 → 4299.54] where a
[4299.54 → 4299.94] man who
[4299.94 → 4300.30] claimed to
[4300.30 → 4300.66] be God
[4300.66 → 4301.24] died on
[4301.24 → 4301.78] a cross
[4301.78 → 4303.00] how is it
[4303.00 → 4303.48] possible
[4303.48 → 4304.60] that
[4304.60 → 4305.24] should have
[4305.24 → 4305.82] the last
[4305.82 → 4306.18] word
[4306.18 → 4306.84] that
[4306.84 → 4307.48] should be
[4307.48 → 4308.56] the means
[4308.56 → 4309.06] by which
[4309.06 → 4309.82] we understand
[4309.82 → 4310.38] all of our
[4310.38 → 4310.56] life
[4310.56 → 4311.14] how is it
[4311.14 → 4311.58] possible
[4311.58 → 4312.76] that
[4312.76 → 4313.98] should be
[4313.98 → 4315.62] what discerns
[4315.62 → 4316.40] and directs
[4316.40 → 4317.02] everything
[4317.02 → 4317.56] that we
[4317.56 → 4317.88] do
[4317.88 → 4319.96] well the
[4319.96 → 4320.30] only way
[4320.30 → 4320.74] that makes
[4320.74 → 4321.24] sense
[4321.24 → 4322.32] in the world
[4322.32 → 4322.90] around us
[4322.90 → 4323.46] the only way
[4323.46 → 4323.78] that
[4323.78 → 4324.58] can be seen
[4324.58 → 4325.34] to be true
[4325.34 → 4326.26] is
[4326.26 → 4328.18] in how
[4328.18 → 4328.96] you and I
[4328.96 → 4330.18] live in
[4330.18 → 4330.76] response
[4330.76 → 4334.02] how we
[4334.02 → 4335.18] hear this
[4335.18 → 4335.60] news
[4335.60 → 4336.48] believe this
[4336.48 → 4336.90] news
[4336.90 → 4337.50] and then
[4337.50 → 4337.90] go
[4337.90 → 4338.56] transformed
[4338.56 → 4339.54] to the
[4339.54 → 4339.84] world
[4339.84 → 4341.68] go
[4341.68 → 4342.42] transformed
[4342.42 → 4343.54] and live
[4343.54 → 4344.08] in such
[4344.08 → 4344.44] a way
[4344.44 → 4344.70] that
[4344.70 → 4345.68] also
[4345.68 → 4346.14] doesn't
[4346.14 → 4346.36] make
[4346.36 → 4346.80] sense
[4346.80 → 4348.32] and that
[4348.32 → 4348.68] likely
[4348.68 → 4349.22] people are
[4349.22 → 4349.46] going to
[4349.46 → 4349.68] think
[4349.68 → 4350.30] is strange
[4350.30 → 4351.16] and weird
[4351.16 → 4352.14] people are
[4352.14 → 4352.32] going to
[4352.32 → 4352.46] think
[4352.46 → 4352.68] it's
[4352.68 → 4353.24] foolish
[4353.24 → 4354.76] and they're
[4354.76 → 4354.90] going to
[4354.90 → 4355.26] get tripped
[4355.26 → 4356.02] up by it
[4356.02 → 4357.74] but they're
[4357.74 → 4358.22] also going to
[4358.22 → 4358.56] go
[4358.56 → 4359.88] why
[4359.88 → 4361.82] why
[4361.82 → 4366.18] verse 24
[4366.18 → 4366.88] we read
[4366.88 → 4367.38] that some
[4367.38 → 4368.12] were convinced
[4368.12 → 4368.62] by what
[4368.62 → 4369.22] Paul said
[4369.22 → 4370.36] but others
[4370.36 → 4370.86] would not
[4370.86 → 4371.38] believe
[4371.38 → 4373.22] and that
[4373.22 → 4373.76] makes sense
[4373.76 → 4374.32] right
[4374.32 → 4376.08] when it's as
[4376.08 → 4376.92] weird as
[4376.92 → 4377.56] this
[4377.56 → 4379.50] when we
[4379.50 → 4380.36] are as
[4380.36 → 4381.58] strange as
[4381.58 → 4382.42] we are
[4382.42 → 4382.88] some of you
[4382.88 → 4383.36] more strange
[4383.36 → 4383.82] than others
[4383.82 → 4386.12] people are
[4386.12 → 4386.40] going to
[4386.40 → 4386.78] wonder
[4386.78 → 4388.28] why
[4388.28 → 4390.24] but hear
[4390.24 → 4390.50] this
[4390.50 → 4390.72] right
[4390.72 → 4391.40] you
[4391.40 → 4392.56] are not
[4392.56 → 4393.16] responsible
[4393.16 → 4394.58] for their
[4394.58 → 4395.36] response
[4395.36 → 4397.66] you're not
[4397.66 → 4398.24] responsible
[4398.24 → 4399.30] for how
[4399.30 → 4399.80] they hear
[4399.80 → 4400.24] you
[4400.24 → 4402.50] right
[4402.50 → 4402.72] there
[4402.72 → 4403.20] you are
[4403.20 → 4403.74] responsible
[4403.74 → 4404.60] to declare
[4404.60 → 4405.24] and to
[4405.24 → 4405.56] proclaim
[4405.56 → 4406.14] and to
[4406.14 → 4406.70] live this
[4406.70 → 4407.30] transformed
[4407.30 → 4407.72] life
[4407.72 → 4408.40] in such
[4408.40 → 4409.08] confusing
[4409.08 → 4409.52] ways
[4409.52 → 4410.10] that it's
[4410.10 → 4410.58] compelling
[4410.58 → 4411.04] to the
[4411.04 → 4411.54] world around
[4411.54 → 4411.76] you
[4411.76 → 4412.34] but you
[4412.34 → 4412.62] are not
[4412.62 → 4413.14] responsible
[4413.14 → 4413.60] for how
[4413.60 → 4413.86] they
[4413.86 → 4414.58] accept
[4414.58 → 4414.84] it
[4414.84 → 4415.82] or not
[4415.82 → 4416.44] that's
[4416.44 → 4416.68] not
[4416.68 → 4417.14] on
[4417.14 → 4417.94] you
[4417.94 → 4421.00] some
[4421.00 → 4421.32] of us
[4421.32 → 4421.60] need to
[4421.60 → 4421.94] hear that
[4421.94 → 4422.28] more than
[4422.28 → 4422.52] others
[4422.52 → 4422.74] this
[4422.74 → 4423.04] morning
[4423.04 → 4425.52] that's
[4425.52 → 4425.66] not
[4425.66 → 4425.80] on
[4425.80 → 4426.00] you
[4426.00 → 4427.18] it's
[4427.18 → 4427.30] not
[4427.30 → 4427.46] your
[4427.46 → 4428.02] responsibility
[4428.02 → 4430.20] but you
[4430.20 → 4430.38] are
[4430.38 → 4430.90] responsible
[4430.90 → 4431.24] to
[4431.24 → 4431.58] proclaim
[4431.58 → 4431.84] it
[4431.84 → 4432.80] to
[4432.80 → 4433.20] declare
[4433.20 → 4433.54] it
[4433.54 → 4434.00] with
[4434.00 → 4434.14] your
[4434.14 → 4434.56] words
[4434.56 → 4435.24] and
[4435.24 → 4435.40] with
[4435.40 → 4435.54] your
[4435.54 → 4435.90] life
[4435.90 → 4436.88] and
[4436.88 → 4437.02] let
[4437.02 → 4437.20] the
[4437.20 → 4437.46] spirit
[4437.46 → 4437.70] do
[4437.70 → 4437.86] what
[4437.86 → 4438.00] the
[4438.00 → 4438.22] spirit
[4438.22 → 4438.38] will
[4438.38 → 4438.60] do
[4438.60 → 4441.80] the
[4441.80 → 4442.14] reality
[4442.14 → 4442.48] is
[4442.48 → 4442.80] and Paul
[4442.80 → 4443.06] says
[4443.06 → 4443.40] this
[4443.40 → 4443.88] right
[4443.88 → 4444.10] in
[4444.10 → 4444.32] verse
[4444.32 → 4446.26] 26
[4446.26 → 4447.26] to 27
[4447.26 → 4447.72] he says
[4447.72 → 4448.50] that basically
[4448.50 → 4448.96] that the
[4448.96 → 4449.48] people will
[4449.48 → 4449.82] be ever
[4449.82 → 4450.14] hearing
[4450.14 → 4450.56] but never
[4450.56 → 4451.16] understanding
[4451.16 → 4451.90] that they
[4451.90 → 4452.28] will ever
[4452.28 → 4452.64] see
[4452.64 → 4453.20] but never
[4453.20 → 4453.64] perceive
[4453.64 → 4454.26] that their
[4454.26 → 4454.62] hearts
[4454.62 → 4455.28] have become
[4455.28 → 4456.18] calloused
[4456.18 → 4456.38] right
[4456.38 → 4456.70] Jesus
[4456.70 → 4457.46] also makes
[4457.46 → 4457.88] reference
[4457.88 → 4458.60] to this
[4458.60 → 4459.00] passage
[4459.00 → 4459.58] from Isaiah
[4459.58 → 4460.00] in Matthew
[4460.00 → 4460.52] 13
[4460.52 → 4460.98] or Mark
[4460.98 → 4461.32] 4
[4461.32 → 4461.64] and John
[4461.64 → 4461.98] 12
[4461.98 → 4462.42] right
[4462.42 → 4462.86] the point
[4462.86 → 4463.42] is
[4463.42 → 4463.88] right
[4463.88 → 4464.38] there are
[4464.38 → 4464.86] always
[4464.86 → 4465.42] going to
[4465.42 → 4465.92] be people
[4465.92 → 4466.40] who don't
[4466.40 → 4466.84] believe
[4466.84 → 4468.20] but their
[4468.20 → 4468.58] belief
[4468.58 → 4468.90] or their
[4468.90 → 4469.38] unbelief
[4469.38 → 4469.86] is not
[4469.86 → 4470.08] your
[4470.08 → 4470.76] responsibility
[4470.76 → 4471.58] your
[4471.58 → 4472.10] responsibility
[4472.10 → 4472.68] is to
[4472.68 → 4473.08] proclaim
[4473.08 → 4473.68] the gospel
[4473.68 → 4474.54] in words
[4474.54 → 4475.06] and in
[4475.06 → 4475.48] a life
[4475.48 → 4475.92] that
[4475.92 → 4476.40] matches
[4476.40 → 4478.62] and can
[4478.62 → 4478.78] I be
[4478.78 → 4478.98] honest
[4478.98 → 4479.34] with you
[4479.34 → 4479.84] if they
[4479.84 → 4480.52] find that
[4480.52 → 4480.96] offensive
[4480.96 → 4482.96] that means
[4482.96 → 4483.36] you're probably
[4483.36 → 4483.92] doing something
[4483.92 → 4484.28] right
[4484.28 → 4487.76] now don't
[4487.76 → 4488.12] hear what I'm
[4488.12 → 4488.58] not saying
[4488.58 → 4489.16] when I say
[4489.16 → 4489.48] that
[4489.48 → 4490.32] right
[4490.32 → 4490.70] don't be
[4490.70 → 4491.12] a jerk
[4491.12 → 4493.22] right
[4493.22 → 4493.72] but instead
[4493.72 → 4494.36] let your
[4494.36 → 4495.12] unmitigated
[4495.12 → 4495.56] love
[4495.56 → 4496.80] right
[4496.80 → 4497.20] let your
[4497.20 → 4498.06] unflinching
[4498.06 → 4498.50] pursuit
[4498.50 → 4499.38] of justice
[4499.38 → 4500.36] right
[4500.36 → 4500.70] let your
[4500.70 → 4501.22] constant
[4501.22 → 4501.94] lifting
[4501.94 → 4502.40] of the
[4502.40 → 4502.78] poor
[4502.78 → 4503.34] and the
[4503.34 → 4503.84] marginalized
[4503.84 → 4504.56] and your
[4504.56 → 4505.54] indefatigable
[4505.54 → 4506.14] desire
[4506.14 → 4507.10] to declare
[4507.10 → 4507.82] Jesus Christ
[4507.82 → 4508.34] as Lord
[4508.34 → 4508.82] and King
[4508.82 → 4509.70] be what
[4509.70 → 4510.50] people find
[4510.50 → 4511.12] impossible
[4511.12 → 4512.26] to understand
[4512.26 → 4514.30] let that
[4514.30 → 4515.02] be what
[4515.02 → 4515.66] trips them
[4515.66 → 4516.04] up
[4516.04 → 4517.44] and you
[4517.44 → 4518.38] might be
[4518.38 → 4518.96] blessed by
[4518.96 → 4519.42] God to
[4519.42 → 4519.82] see them
[4519.82 → 4520.22] tripped
[4520.22 → 4521.06] and falling
[4521.06 → 4521.64] into the
[4521.64 → 4522.00] arms of
[4522.00 → 4522.56] his grace
[4522.56 → 4526.08] in verse
[4526.08 → 4526.78] 28 of
[4526.78 → 4527.28] our text
[4527.28 → 4527.88] Paul is
[4527.88 → 4528.36] basically
[4528.36 → 4528.82] saying
[4528.82 → 4529.60] if they
[4529.60 → 4530.00] don't want
[4530.00 → 4530.20] to hear
[4530.20 → 4530.64] the gospel
[4530.64 → 4531.10] of Jesus
[4531.10 → 4531.46] if you
[4531.46 → 4531.74] don't want
[4531.74 → 4531.92] to hear
[4531.92 → 4532.32] the gospel
[4532.32 → 4532.76] of Jesus
[4532.76 → 4533.90] other people
[4533.90 → 4534.32] will hear
[4534.32 → 4534.64] it
[4534.64 → 4536.84] and so
[4536.84 → 4537.12] if people
[4537.12 → 4537.32] in your
[4537.32 → 4537.48] life
[4537.48 → 4537.78] don't want
[4537.78 → 4538.02] to hear
[4538.02 → 4538.26] it
[4538.26 → 4539.52] find those
[4539.52 → 4539.92] that do
[4539.92 → 4542.96] the mission
[4542.96 → 4543.40] of God
[4543.40 → 4544.44] is unstoppable
[4544.44 → 4545.92] and the
[4545.92 → 4546.48] church that
[4546.48 → 4547.04] joins
[4547.04 → 4547.88] the mission
[4547.88 → 4548.42] of God
[4548.42 → 4549.10] is
[4549.10 → 4549.96] likewise
[4549.96 → 4551.28] unstoppable
[4551.28 → 4553.94] because God
[4553.94 → 4554.58] cannot be
[4554.58 → 4555.00] stopped
[4555.00 → 4556.30] the gospel
[4556.30 → 4556.90] will not
[4556.90 → 4557.52] be stopped
[4557.52 → 4558.62] God
[4558.62 → 4559.34] cannot
[4559.34 → 4560.24] be
[4560.24 → 4561.24] stopped
[4561.24 → 4563.12] that's
[4563.12 → 4563.14] that's
[4563.14 → 4563.30] my
[4563.30 → 4563.76] story
[4563.76 → 4565.24] and I'm
[4565.24 → 4565.46] sticking
[4565.46 → 4566.38] to it
[4566.38 → 4566.82] amen
