• The importance of submitting to authorities as they serve God's purposes
• Responsible citizenship involves understanding the order of governance and recognizing that authorities are established by God
• The governing authorities are part of God's providential hand in creating and upholding societal structures for His purposes
• Authorities can be understood on a macro (big movements of history) or micro (individual actions) level, but also includes ordinary means like medicine and governmental authority
• There are multiple spheres of authority established by God as part of the creation order
• The distinction between governing authorities and other established authorities such as family, church, arts, and natural sciences
• The idea that each authority sphere has its own realm of interest and should function autonomously
• The importance of recognizing the limits on the scope of earthly authorities and the role of the state in maintaining those limits
• The potential for abuse of power by individuals or groups within an authority sphere
• The tendency of the state to over-function in its responsibilities, leading citizens to upload responsibilities to a higher body.
• The authority of governing bodies is established by God
• Responsible citizens understand the limits of power and put checks in place to balance authority
• Rebellion against authority is rebellion against what God has instituted, leading to judgment on oneself
• Obedience to authority is a key aspect of responsible citizenship, as seen in 1 Peter 2 and Titus 3

• Reflection on the importance of choosing to obey God even if it has consequences
• Christians have a responsibility to obey governing authorities
• There are three ways Christians share and live this responsibility: submission, submitting according to conscience, and responsible citizenship
• Submission involves paying taxes, acting as civil servants, contributing to society's well-being, and praying for leaders
• Submitting according to conscience requires evaluating the state in relation to governing authorities and obeying based on God's established order
• Responsible citizens do good and act righteously, not out of fear but because it is their conscience
• The motivation behind obedience is to obey God, who has established the state, rather than solely out of a desire to avoid punishment.
• The importance of living as Christians influences what others think about God and Christianity
• Praying for political leaders is a crucial aspect of living peaceful and quiet lives in goodness and holiness
• An atmosphere of quiet and peaceful living allows Christians to pursue activities consistent with God's will
• This atmosphere enables various aspects of life, such as raising families in the Lord, serving community needs, and spreading the gospel
• Doing good for goodness’s sake is essential for responsible citizens and benefits the message of the church
