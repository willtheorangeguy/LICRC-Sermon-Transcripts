[0.00 --> 29.98]  Thank you.
[30.00 --> 59.98]  Thank you.
[60.00 --> 89.98]  Thank you.
[90.00 --> 119.98]  Thank you.
[120.00 --> 127.26]  Let the King of my heart be the mountain where I run.
[127.72 --> 134.08]  The fountain I drink from, oh, he is my song.
[134.08 --> 157.34]  I choose to worship.
[157.34 --> 160.34]  I choose to bow.
[160.34 --> 167.76]  Though there's pain in the offering, I lay it down.
[169.02 --> 175.56]  Here in the conflict, when doubt surrounds.
[175.56 --> 181.94]  Though my soul is unraveling, I choose you now.
[182.56 --> 190.62]  I will praise you through the fire, through the storm and through the flood.
[190.62 --> 196.92]  There is nothing I could ever seal my soul.
[197.88 --> 201.68]  In the valley, you are worthy.
[202.14 --> 204.86]  You are good when life is not.
[205.10 --> 211.06]  You will always and forever be my soul.
[211.06 --> 213.52]  I build my own.
[218.06 --> 221.36]  Good morning.
[223.28 --> 225.72]  Welcome into worship.
[225.96 --> 229.54]  We're really excited that you all are here with us this morning.
[229.54 --> 232.20]  This morning is a special service.
[232.20 --> 235.50]  As you can tell, we are having Lord's Supper together.
[235.80 --> 240.90]  But also, we're welcoming some new members into our church community here.
[240.96 --> 242.10]  And so we celebrate that.
[242.18 --> 247.28]  And so if you're here visiting with that or on part of that, we're grateful that you're with us this morning.
[247.96 --> 248.82]  My name is Chris.
[249.02 --> 250.48]  I'm one of the pastors here.
[250.48 --> 254.98]  And it's my privilege to lead in our shared worship together.
[255.14 --> 261.38]  Before we begin in earnest, there's a couple announcements that need to be brought to your attention.
[262.34 --> 269.40]  And so if you are a member here or you worship with us regularly, you've heard that we are hosting Reactivate,
[269.40 --> 278.04]  which is a youth conference for young people, high school age kids from off over BC, from different Christian Reformed churches.
[278.04 --> 285.28]  They're going to descend on us here for a weekend, the second weekend in September.
[286.02 --> 288.54]  And so we need a bunch of volunteers to make that happen.
[288.94 --> 293.06]  So there is a volunteer sign-up sheet that's gone out in the e-bulletin.
[293.76 --> 297.26]  And so you can go to the e-bulletin and sign up for different things there.
[297.38 --> 305.44]  If you don't receive the e-bulletin and one would like to, please connect with the office at communications at licrc.ca.
[305.44 --> 306.62]  And you can get that.
[306.62 --> 313.08]  Or if you don't want to receive the e-bulletin but would like to sign up, again, connect with the office, same email address,
[313.20 --> 316.22]  and they'll just forward you the link to be able to sign up for that.
[317.52 --> 324.12]  We need some 80 to 110 different volunteer-serving opportunities filled there.
[324.32 --> 330.10]  So please sign up once and sign up often, and we'll be able to pull this off together.
[330.10 --> 338.46]  As well, we announced last week, coming up on Labor Day weekend, that Sunday, September 3rd,
[338.46 --> 342.32]  we are going to have an event that we're calling Beat the Topes.
[343.06 --> 345.46]  And so we have a baseball team called the Isotopes.
[345.90 --> 350.24]  We finished our first season back in the end of June.
[350.24 --> 357.68]  And we, the Isotopes, are challenging you, the rest of the church, to a game together.
[357.94 --> 361.94]  And so after church on that Sunday, we're going to head over to a park and we're going to play.
[362.56 --> 365.10]  And so keep your eyes open for that.
[365.50 --> 371.14]  And if you did not play on the baseball team, we're going to put you on another team,
[371.14 --> 374.18]  and you're going to play against the Isotopes.
[375.18 --> 380.26]  And so, Daryl Wind, I'm looking at you, because he wants to beat us.
[380.58 --> 382.32]  But Kim, he's not going to, right?
[383.22 --> 383.66]  Yeah.
[384.22 --> 385.98]  That sounded very confident.
[386.12 --> 386.34]  Okay.
[387.10 --> 387.54]  Great.
[388.04 --> 388.96]  But look out for that.
[389.12 --> 390.64]  Kevin will remind us.
[391.64 --> 395.80]  The Junior Topes can come in their uniforms and cheer on the Isotopes, of course.
[396.30 --> 396.66]  Right?
[396.72 --> 397.58]  You're going to cheer on your dad?
[399.02 --> 399.42]  Maybe.
[399.64 --> 401.00]  Yeah, that's about what I expected.
[402.04 --> 402.38]  All right.
[402.88 --> 404.58]  I believe that's it for announcements.
[405.08 --> 407.28]  And so if you are able, and where you are, would you stand,
[407.64 --> 411.18]  and we will be ushered into God's presence together in worship.
[413.32 --> 415.58]  Receive the greeting of our God.
[417.02 --> 421.78]  Grace, mercy, and peace to you, from God our Father,
[421.78 --> 424.96]  from the Lord Jesus Christ, Son, and our Savior,
[425.50 --> 427.88]  through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[429.20 --> 429.68]  Amen.
[429.68 --> 435.10]  I invite you to turn to those around you and welcome them into our worship together this morning.
[436.94 --> 437.34]  Good morning.
[437.34 --> 437.96]  Good morning, peace of Christ.
[438.98 --> 440.10]  Good morning, peace of Christ.
[441.62 --> 442.68]  Good morning, peace of Christ.
[450.50 --> 451.68]  Good morning, peace of Christ.
[455.14 --> 455.70]  Good morning.
[455.70 --> 469.24]  Good morning, peace of Christ.
[469.24 --> 469.84]  Good morning, peace of Christ.
[469.84 --> 474.66]  Brothers and sisters in Christ, we come together this morning in faith to worship the God of Abraham,
[474.96 --> 477.00]  the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
[477.00 --> 483.40]  People of the Most High God, you are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works,
[483.68 --> 485.94]  which God prepared in advance for you to do.
[486.60 --> 489.12]  Praise the Lord, you people of the risen King.
[489.82 --> 495.04]  Praise the Lord, you his angels, you mighty ones who do his bidding, who obey his word.
[495.54 --> 500.40]  Praise the Lord, all his heavenly hosts, you his servants who will do his will.
[501.14 --> 504.92]  Praise the Lord, all his works, everywhere in his dominion.
[504.92 --> 506.90]  Praise the Lord, my soul.
[506.90 --> 508.90]  Yep.
[536.90 --> 541.90]  From every nation, all of creation,
[542.68 --> 545.64]  powerful nations of the Lord.
[547.04 --> 550.24]  Every tongue in heaven and heaven
[550.24 --> 552.64]  shall bear your glory.
[552.86 --> 555.66]  Every nation, the Lord shall come.
[555.66 --> 561.04]  With your spirit, you will be exalted, O God.
[561.64 --> 564.56]  And your kingdom shall come.
[564.56 --> 568.64]  Bless the name of all nations of the Lord.
[572.80 --> 577.22]  History and honor, glory and pride,
[577.88 --> 580.58]  lead to the nations of the Lord.
[582.02 --> 586.84]  From every nation, all of creation,
[587.64 --> 590.42]  powerful nations of the Lord.
[590.42 --> 595.12]  Every tongue in heaven and heaven
[595.12 --> 597.52]  shall bear your glory.
[597.76 --> 600.54]  Every nation, the knowledge of God.
[601.08 --> 605.74]  With mercy and beauty, the glory of God.
[605.74 --> 609.24]  And your kingdom shall come.
[609.24 --> 610.24]  Christ, the glory of God.
[610.24 --> 611.24]  And your kingdom shall come.
[611.24 --> 613.24]  All of creation, the glory of God.
[617.24 --> 621.90]  And your children, all of the earth.
[621.90 --> 626.24]  Sing to the nations of the Lord.
[626.48 --> 631.12]  For nothing compared to the righteous Lord.
[631.48 --> 636.08]  Sing to the nations of the Lord.
[636.08 --> 652.56]  Peace be upon you.
[652.56 --> 654.90]  And your kingdom shall come.
[655.42 --> 656.86]  blessing about sin.
[659.32 --> 661.08]  Faith be upon you.
[661.08 --> 691.06]  Thank you.
[691.08 --> 721.06]  Thank you.
[721.08 --> 723.08]  Thank you.
[751.08 --> 753.08]  Thank you.
[781.08 --> 783.08]  Thank you.
[811.08 --> 813.08]  Thank you.
[841.08 --> 843.08]  Thank you.
[871.08 --> 873.08]  Thank you.
[901.08 --> 903.08]  Thank you.
[903.08 --> 905.08]  Thank you.
[905.08 --> 910.08]  Thank you.
[910.08 --> 913.08]  Thank you.
[913.08 --> 918.08]  Thank you.
[918.08 --> 926.48]  I'm gonna sing in the middle of the storm
[926.48 --> 932.88]  Louder and louder, you're gonna hear my praise of Lord
[932.88 --> 938.28]  I'll cry in the ashes, hope will arise
[938.28 --> 943.70]  I'm facing here, the King is alive
[948.08 --> 958.20]  Oh, praise the hallelujah
[958.20 --> 964.66]  Oh, praise the hallelujah
[964.66 --> 971.04]  Oh, praise the hallelujah
[971.04 --> 977.10]  I'm gonna praise the hallelujah
[977.10 --> 987.24]  Our confession comes from Psalm 103.
[988.14 --> 991.34]  Praise the Lord, O my soul, all my inmost being.
[991.64 --> 992.76]  Praise his holy name.
[993.32 --> 996.22]  Praise the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits,
[996.74 --> 999.58]  who forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases,
[1000.24 --> 1003.86]  who redeems your life from the pit and crowns you with love and compassion,
[1003.86 --> 1010.10]  who satisfies your desires with good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagles.
[1010.84 --> 1014.10]  The Lord works righteousness and justice for all the oppressed.
[1014.84 --> 1020.02]  He has made known his ways to Moses, his deeds to the people of Israel.
[1020.78 --> 1025.50]  The Lord is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in love.
[1025.96 --> 1029.24]  He will not always accuse, nor will he harbor his anger forever.
[1029.24 --> 1034.18]  He doesn't treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities.
[1034.88 --> 1039.30]  For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him.
[1039.76 --> 1045.20]  As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.
[1045.82 --> 1051.44]  As a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear him.
[1051.84 --> 1053.58]  For he knows how we are formed.
[1054.04 --> 1055.46]  He remembers that we're dust.
[1056.08 --> 1057.88]  The life of mortals is like grass.
[1057.88 --> 1060.04]  They flourish like the flower of the field.
[1060.36 --> 1062.40]  And the wind blows over it and it's gone.
[1063.12 --> 1065.08]  And its place remembers it no more.
[1065.92 --> 1070.64]  But from everlasting to everlasting, the Lord's love is with those who fear him.
[1070.92 --> 1073.14]  And his righteousness with his children's children.
[1073.78 --> 1077.64]  And with those who keep his covenant and remember to obey his precepts.
[1078.18 --> 1080.48]  The Lord has established his throne in heaven.
[1080.84 --> 1082.76]  And his kingdom rules over all.
[1087.88 --> 1090.68]  And the Lord has called me to obey hisоне.
[1090.68 --> 1096.48]  And with those whocep temu being helped.
[1096.48 --> 1111.84]  I come, I'm unguessed, coming near behind my breast.
[1111.84 --> 1118.96]  Without you, I fall apart.
[1119.56 --> 1126.04]  You're the one that guides my heart.
[1126.48 --> 1136.96]  I need you, oh, I need you.
[1136.96 --> 1143.76]  Every hour I need you.
[1144.24 --> 1155.96]  My one defense, my righteousness, oh God, how I need you.
[1156.48 --> 1158.48]  I'm unguessed.
[1158.48 --> 1160.48]  I'm unguessed.
[1160.48 --> 1162.96]  I'm unguessed.
[1162.96 --> 1164.96]  I need you, oh, I need you.
[1164.96 --> 1166.96]  I need you, oh, I need you.
[1166.96 --> 1168.96]  I need you, oh, I need you.
[1168.96 --> 1170.96]  I need you, oh, I need you.
[1170.96 --> 1172.96]  I need you, oh, I need you.
[1172.96 --> 1180.96]  I need you, oh, Lord, I am free.
[1180.96 --> 1182.96]  I need you, oh, I need you.
[1182.96 --> 1187.32]  Only heaven, thanks is my singly.
[1187.44 --> 1194.78]  You are my heart, Lord, I am free.
[1194.78 --> 1202.78]  Holy man, Jesus, I see me.
[1204.78 --> 1211.78]  I need you, oh, I need you.
[1212.78 --> 1218.78]  Every night I need you.
[1218.78 --> 1230.78]  My holiness, my righteousness, for God, I need you.
[1231.78 --> 1236.78]  Teach my song to Christ in you.
[1237.78 --> 1242.78]  When temptation counts my prayer.
[1242.78 --> 1248.78]  I cannot stand upon you.
[1249.78 --> 1253.78]  Jesus, Lord, my heart and sin.
[1254.78 --> 1259.78]  I cannot stand upon you.
[1261.78 --> 1265.78]  Jesus, Lord, my heart and sin.
[1265.78 --> 1276.78]  I need you, oh, I need you.
[1277.78 --> 1282.78]  Every hour I need you.
[1282.78 --> 1285.78]  My heart and sin.
[1285.78 --> 1286.78]  My heart and sin.
[1286.78 --> 1288.78]  My heart and sin.
[1288.78 --> 1289.78]  My heart and sin.
[1289.78 --> 1294.78]  For God, how I need you.
[1295.78 --> 1302.78]  I need you, oh, I need you.
[1303.78 --> 1308.78]  Every hour I need you.
[1308.78 --> 1309.78]  My love and sin.
[1309.78 --> 1311.78]  My heart and sin.
[1311.78 --> 1312.78]  My blood and sin.
[1312.78 --> 1315.78]  My righteousness.
[1315.78 --> 1319.78]  Oh, God, how I need you.
[1320.78 --> 1324.78]  My love and sin.
[1325.78 --> 1327.78]  My righteousness.
[1327.78 --> 1335.86]  Righteousness, O God, how I need you.
[1357.78 --> 1365.68]  I'm calling on the God of Jacob.
[1367.68 --> 1372.30]  Through the 90s to generations,
[1374.44 --> 1379.94]  I know that you will keep your life.
[1381.62 --> 1386.06]  I'm calling on the God of Moses.
[1387.78 --> 1393.48]  O one who opened up the ocean,
[1395.18 --> 1401.98]  I need you now to do the same thing for me.
[1408.98 --> 1412.06]  O God, I know I need you.
[1412.06 --> 1416.06]  O God, I know I need you now.
[1416.06 --> 1425.46]  O God, O God, O God, O God, O God,

[1746.90 --> 1756.56]  As we have just sung and prayed, we are relying on the Holy Spirit to fill us again and to stir our hearts.
[1756.56 --> 1766.76]  And one of the ways that we celebrate God doing that in our midst is by seeing God grow his church, by seeing God grow this church.
[1766.76 --> 1775.68]  And so we're really excited to welcome some new members into our faith family together this morning.
[1776.60 --> 1780.30]  People who we welcome this morning have been worshiping with us for some time.
[1780.44 --> 1782.40]  And so you've probably met them.
[1782.46 --> 1784.22]  But if you haven't, here is your chance.
[1784.22 --> 1792.62]  If you are wondering about joining and becoming sort of covenant members in our church family, we're going to do this again at the end of September.
[1793.50 --> 1794.92]  And so connect with me.
[1795.20 --> 1797.62]  I've already got a group who's anticipating that.
[1797.74 --> 1800.42]  And so you can join in for that time as well.
[1802.42 --> 1806.02]  First, we're going to invite the Rauchema family up to the front.
[1806.02 --> 1814.12]  And so Justin, Amanda, Ian, Hannah, Linnea, and Amy, come on up and just take a spot here with me behind the table.
[1814.78 --> 1817.50]  I won't make you stand up on the stage altogether.
[1821.12 --> 1826.96]  The Rauchema family have come to us from Christ Covenant PCA Church.
[1827.08 --> 1829.94]  They have been worshiping with us for a while.
[1829.94 --> 1833.84]  Justin was on the baseball team this past summer.
[1834.16 --> 1837.24]  And some of them go to the youth program.
[1837.36 --> 1839.20]  The girls are in the GEMS program.
[1839.68 --> 1842.80]  And so they've been involved and have plugged in quickly.
[1843.80 --> 1852.16]  Justin and Amanda, Ian, Hannah, Linnea, and Amy, it's our hope and prayer that here your faith in God will be strengthened,
[1852.38 --> 1854.64]  that your love for Jesus will be grown,
[1854.64 --> 1863.56]  and that you will find opportunity to connect and serve in the Spirit as you join with us on mission in this community and to the world.
[1864.44 --> 1867.02]  As we welcome you this morning into the church family,
[1867.24 --> 1872.30]  we're just going to ask that you affirm the faith that you have professed and your commitment to God's mission
[1872.30 --> 1877.00]  in and through Langley-Emmanuel to our city and region and to the world.
[1877.46 --> 1880.32]  And so to do so, I'm going to ask you three questions.
[1880.92 --> 1884.42]  And then at the end, I'll invite you to respond as a family.
[1885.40 --> 1894.52]  First, do you believe in Jesus as your Savior and Lord and that in Him alone is hope and freedom from sin found?
[1895.60 --> 1902.00]  Second, do you believe that the Bible is the Word of God, revealing His plan for redemption in Jesus Christ,
[1902.20 --> 1906.30]  and that the preaching and teaching of Langley-Emmanuel reflect this truth?
[1906.30 --> 1913.52]  And three, do you promise with the help of the Holy Spirit to do all you can to strengthen your relationship to Jesus
[1913.52 --> 1918.76]  by being part of the life of this church, recognizing its oversight and authority,
[1918.92 --> 1923.72]  and joining with us on mission for Jesus in this community and beyond?
[1924.48 --> 1926.30]  Raukoma family, what is your answer?
[1926.30 --> 1932.70]  We do with God's help.
[1933.46 --> 1936.86]  Everything we do, we do with God's help.
[1937.38 --> 1938.64]  We acknowledge that this morning.
[1939.12 --> 1944.52]  As well, we want to welcome someone who's come to us from another CRC church.
[1944.52 --> 1949.00]  And so, Sasha, if you're here, yeah, can you come up to the front, please?
[1951.92 --> 1957.28]  So, Sasha Cosell comes to us from Willoughby CRC
[1957.28 --> 1960.26]  and has also been worshiping with us for a little while now,
[1960.38 --> 1964.96]  and we are excited to welcome you and that you are here.
[1965.66 --> 1968.50]  We are grateful that all of you are with us,
[1968.62 --> 1972.42]  and we're excited to see what God will do in our midst through you.
[1973.08 --> 1977.76]  And our prayer is that as you join our shared ministry and mission,
[1977.96 --> 1980.56]  as you join our church family in serving God,
[1981.22 --> 1986.18]  that we together will reveal His kingdom come and His kingdom coming.
[1986.18 --> 1991.26]  And just as they have made themselves known to us,
[1991.44 --> 1994.66]  we are going to offer support and encouragement to them.
[1994.86 --> 1997.94]  And so, congregation, I'm going to ask you guys a question.
[1998.24 --> 2000.08]  And so, as you're able, I'm going to invite you to stand,
[2000.62 --> 2005.28]  that you too might speak a word of promise and faithfulness to them.
[2006.46 --> 2009.70]  And so do you, people of God here at Langley Emanuel,
[2009.70 --> 2015.04]  promise all these wonderful people your love, encouragement, and prayers.
[2016.18 --> 2017.76]  We do, for God's sake.
[2018.56 --> 2018.84]  Amen.
[2019.18 --> 2020.06]  You may have a seat.
[2020.18 --> 2021.84]  You guys just stay here for one minute.
[2022.46 --> 2023.26]  I'm going to pray for you.
[2024.58 --> 2028.18]  If you are so moved, I encourage you just to hold out your hand
[2028.18 --> 2030.90]  as we mark the Spirit moving in this place
[2030.90 --> 2033.06]  and calling us to service together.
[2033.38 --> 2033.86]  Let's pray.
[2033.86 --> 2039.64]  Holy God, Heavenly Father,
[2040.14 --> 2044.90]  just as you sent Jesus into the world to redeem the world,
[2045.00 --> 2049.20]  you send us out now to the world to proclaim that truth.
[2050.20 --> 2052.74]  And so we thank you for the Rauchema family.
[2053.12 --> 2056.56]  We thank you for Sasha and for their joining us here.
[2056.56 --> 2060.08]  We thank you for the ways that you have already included them
[2060.08 --> 2061.84]  in our church family and fellowship,
[2062.00 --> 2065.76]  the ways that you have already been at work in them and through them.
[2065.90 --> 2068.24]  And we pray, Lord God, by your Spirit,
[2068.44 --> 2071.22]  continue to grow them.
[2072.60 --> 2076.72]  Grow us all in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ,
[2076.80 --> 2080.94]  and send us out in Holy Spirit power with boldness
[2080.94 --> 2084.82]  to proclaim your kingdom come and kingdom coming.
[2086.24 --> 2090.18]  Holy God, fill these ones here so much with your Spirit
[2090.18 --> 2093.84]  that their passion stirs our passion,
[2094.16 --> 2097.80]  that their affections for Jesus and their love for the gospel
[2097.80 --> 2101.62]  stirs our affections for Jesus and our love for the gospel.
[2102.56 --> 2105.28]  Hold us in covenant fellowship, we pray,
[2105.28 --> 2108.32]  in the name of Jesus Christ, who is our Savior.
[2108.32 --> 2110.94]  And all God's people said, Amen.
[2111.76 --> 2113.64]  Amen. Thank you, guys. You may have a seat.
[2114.68 --> 2117.90]  After our worship together, we have a time of fellowship,
[2118.16 --> 2121.00]  and so I encourage you, if you haven't yet,
[2121.86 --> 2125.52]  welcome them, introduce yourself to them,
[2125.94 --> 2130.40]  but do your best not to queue up behind them for too long
[2130.40 --> 2132.24]  because that gets really intimidating and awkward,
[2132.30 --> 2133.20]  and we all know how that feels.
[2133.76 --> 2135.76]  Let's continue in song together.
[2135.76 --> 2140.04]  Stand and join us in song singing over
[2140.04 --> 2143.48]  Sashla Karamahdhan with the song, Light a Fire.
[2143.48 --> 2147.76]  focused on music playing over
[2147.76 --> 2149.62]  Sashla Karamahdhan with the song, Light a Fire.
[2149.62 --> 2151.04]  And we all know how that feels.
[2151.04 --> 2153.30]  Let's sing a song, Light a Fire.
[2153.30 --> 2155.70]  Let's sing a song, Light a Fire.
[2155.70 --> 2157.88]  Just a song, Light a Fire,
[2157.88 --> 2159.04]  and we all know how that feels.
[2159.04 --> 2161.14]  Let's sing a song, Light a Fire.
[2161.14 --> 2163.08]  Let's sing a song, Light a Fire.
[2163.08 --> 2167.46]  Be the children of my salvation.
[2170.16 --> 2176.20]  Take me back to where it all began.
[2179.26 --> 2185.46]  Where I ever wanted was the present.
[2185.46 --> 2193.46]  Where I longed to be there on the side.
[2196.46 --> 2202.46]  And I remember that I can't wait.
[2203.50 --> 2206.46]  Till nothing which we must face.
[2207.94 --> 2211.46]  I like reason I'll turn to you.
[2211.46 --> 2219.46]  I will be there on the arrows that burn in my heart.
[2221.30 --> 2224.46]  I'll not take you back to your side.
[2225.62 --> 2228.46]  My life is now to turn to you.
[2232.46 --> 2237.46]  You will be a pure and good in spirit.
[2237.46 --> 2246.46]  Take me back to where it all began.
[2248.46 --> 2251.46]  You will be there on the side.
[2251.46 --> 2253.46]  You will be there on the side.
[2253.46 --> 2255.46]  You will be there on the side.
[2259.46 --> 2263.46]  You will be there on the side.
[2263.46 --> 2265.46]  You will be there on the side.
[2265.46 --> 2266.46]  You will be there on the side.
[2266.46 --> 2270.46]  You will be there on the side.
[2270.46 --> 2281.74]  when
[2281.74 --> 2291.00]  The end, all the embers that were in my heart
[2291.00 --> 2295.30]  Lord, I'll take you back to the storm
[2295.30 --> 2300.30]  My love is an altar to you
[2300.30 --> 2310.52]  I'm sorry, please forgive me
[2310.52 --> 2315.70]  Lord, when I got home
[2315.70 --> 2318.74]  Lord, I need you
[2318.74 --> 2323.64]  Now I need you
[2323.64 --> 2329.42]  To the way that I saw
[2329.42 --> 2335.40]  Lord, I'll take you back to the day
[2335.40 --> 2339.70]  To the death of Jesus' name
[2339.70 --> 2343.88]  I'm not reasonable to do
[2343.88 --> 2353.26]  The end, all the embers that were in my heart
[2353.26 --> 2356.88]  Lord, I'll take you back to the storm
[2356.88 --> 2361.06]  My love is an altar to you
[2361.06 --> 2375.24]  All the embers that were in my heart
[2375.24 --> 2386.92]  All the earth will shout your praise
[2386.92 --> 2391.42]  Our hearts and grimees, won't we sing
[2391.42 --> 2399.42]  Great are you, Lord
[2399.42 --> 2403.60]  Great are you, Lord
[2403.60 --> 2417.78]  Great are you, Lord
[2417.78 --> 2421.78]  God, the earth will shout your praise
[2421.78 --> 2425.78]  Our hearts and grimees, won't we sing
[2425.78 --> 2429.96]  Great are you, Lord
[2429.96 --> 2433.96]  Great are you, Lord
[2433.96 --> 2435.96]  Lord, we sing your praise
[2435.96 --> 2436.14]  So glad
[2436.14 --> 2438.14]  May our lungs
[2438.14 --> 2439.14]  So glad
[2439.14 --> 2441.14]  And we pour out our praise
[2441.14 --> 2444.64]  For our praise is your name

[2447.52 --> 2449.52]  And we pour out our praise
[2449.52 --> 2450.04]  May our praise
[2450.04 --> 2450.54]  So glad
[2450.54 --> 2452.54]  Won't we sing your name
[2452.54 --> 2457.06]  In our lungs
[2457.06 --> 2458.60]  So we pour out our praise
[2458.60 --> 2460.76]  Pourquoi, and praise
[2460.76 --> 2471.02]  But we author
[2471.02 --> 2471.70]  ihn
[2471.70 --> 2491.80]  Father, I'm sorry. Please forgive me. For when I'm gone, Lord, I need you.
[2491.80 --> 2503.06]  Now I need you to awake my soul.
[2521.80 --> 2547.20]  A deacon here. The offerings today for the August the 13th, first is for the budget. Special
[2547.20 --> 2554.58]  offering is for Union Gospel Missions. They are determined to restore the God-given dignity
[2554.58 --> 2563.30]  of people by sharing and demonstrating the love of Jesus Christ, providing without discrimination

[2574.30 --> 2584.80]  people facing poverty, homelessness, and addiction hope by coming alongside toward recovery.
[2584.80 --> 2593.80]  2 Corinthians 9, 8 reads, and God is able to make all grace abound to you so that in all
[2593.80 --> 2600.80]  things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good works.
[2600.80 --> 2617.06]  3 Corinthians 9, 9 18
[2617.06 --> 2647.04]  Thank you.
[2647.06 --> 2677.04]  Thank you.
[2677.06 --> 2707.04]  Thank you.
[2707.06 --> 2737.04]  Thank you.
[2737.06 --> 2767.04]  Thank you.
[2767.04 --> 2769.04]  Thank you.
[2769.04 --> 2771.04]  Thank you.
[2771.04 --> 2773.04]  Thank you.
[2773.04 --> 2775.04]  Thank you.
[2775.04 --> 2777.04]  Thank you.
[2777.04 --> 2779.04]  Thank you.
[2779.04 --> 2783.04]  Thank you.
[2783.04 --> 2785.04]  Thank you.
[2785.04 --> 2787.04]  Thank you.
[2787.04 --> 2789.04]  Thank you.
[2789.04 --> 2791.04]  Thank you.
[2791.04 --> 2793.04]  Thank you.
[2793.04 --> 2795.04]  Thank you.
[2795.14 --> 2797.04]  So,
[2797.04 --> 2799.04]  thank you.
[2799.04 --> 2803.04]  Thank you.
[2803.04 --> 2805.04]  Thank you.
[2805.04 --> 2807.04]  Thank you.
[2807.04 --> 2809.04]  Thank you.
[2809.04 --> 2811.04]  Thank you.
[2811.04 --> 2813.04]  Thank you.
[2813.04 --> 2815.04]  Thank you.
[2815.04 --> 2817.04]  Thank you.
[2817.04 --> 2819.04]  Thank you.
[2819.04 --> 2821.04]  Thank you.
[2821.04 --> 2823.04]  Thank you.
[2823.04 --> 2825.04]  Thank you.
[2825.04 --> 2827.04]  Thank you.
[2827.04 --> 2829.04]  Thank you.
[2829.04 --> 2835.04]  Thank you.
[2835.04 --> 2837.04]  Thank you.
[2837.04 --> 2839.04]  Thank you.
[2839.04 --> 2841.04]  Thank you.
[2841.04 --> 2846.10]  Good morning.
[2846.78 --> 2850.72]  My name is Seth, and I am one of the pastoral elders at our church here,
[2850.96 --> 2853.80]  and it's my pleasure to lead you in our church family prayer.
[2854.64 --> 2860.40]  Before I do that, though, on Friday night, it's tradition in my family to get pizza,
[2860.86 --> 2865.74]  and we have a movie after that, but my son insists that he only gets McDonald's,
[2865.74 --> 2869.62]  two cheeseburgers and a medium French fries every Friday.
[2869.94 --> 2870.70]  It has to happen.
[2871.04 --> 2871.74]  So we do that.
[2872.06 --> 2872.54]  That's fine.
[2873.04 --> 2874.80]  These are things we do because we love our children.
[2876.32 --> 2879.04]  This past Friday, we're waiting in the line at McDonald's,
[2879.08 --> 2882.28]  and my son, like most of us, has a tough time waiting.
[2883.04 --> 2887.68]  My son, like many of us, expresses this frustration quickly.
[2888.58 --> 2893.22]  Many of us are still learning to keep that in check and to speak that appropriately,
[2893.22 --> 2894.80]  but we're in line, and he just says,
[2895.10 --> 2898.20]  Oh, what is taking this line so long?
[2898.70 --> 2900.30]  There's all of one car in front of us.
[2900.30 --> 2903.10]  But I said, Well, it takes time to make their food.
[2903.30 --> 2904.54]  Oh, it's taking forever.
[2905.50 --> 2910.80]  And in one of my rare, brilliant parenting moments, I said, Well, how about instead of complaining,
[2911.54 --> 2917.32]  why don't we pray that the people in McDonald's can cook your food well and quickly so that we can keep moving through?
[2917.32 --> 2918.32]  Fine.
[2918.32 --> 2923.40]  I said, Dear God, help the McDonald's people get the food done well so that I can eat my food.
[2924.20 --> 2926.26]  Lo and behold, the car moves in front.
[2926.90 --> 2927.46]  See, Dad?
[2927.96 --> 2929.28]  I'm like, Yeah, this is great.
[2929.34 --> 2932.74]  And I'm thinking, Oh, he's going to see these things through eyes of faith like God is good and gracious.
[2933.10 --> 2935.62]  He goes, Prayer helps us get what we want.
[2935.62 --> 2936.62]  Okay.
[2938.62 --> 2939.02]  Okay.
[2939.66 --> 2942.30]  Sometimes we approach prayer like that, too.
[2943.48 --> 2944.34]  We are human.
[2944.58 --> 2945.16]  We are fallen.
[2945.30 --> 2945.80]  We are broken.
[2946.42 --> 2949.48]  And it's not necessarily that we don't know how to ask God.
[2950.20 --> 2954.12]  I think the bottom line is he's so glad that we come to him and we ask.
[2954.12 --> 2958.78]  And if you read the e-bulletin this week, you saw that there are many needs in our church.
[2959.68 --> 2963.28]  Health, heartbreak, sickness, brokenness.
[2963.72 --> 2966.72]  There's a lot of hurt and pain and tears in this world.
[2966.96 --> 2967.94]  And we see that.
[2969.40 --> 2975.44]  And when we come to God, yeah, sometimes it is in that hope that there will be that quick answer,
[2976.10 --> 2980.40]  that the line moves, that there is healing, that there is immediate grace that we see.
[2980.40 --> 2985.96]  But sometimes God asks us to be patient and to see things through eyes of faith.
[2986.96 --> 2989.84]  And please join me in prayer as we keep that in mind.
[2993.46 --> 2997.80]  Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth.
[2998.80 --> 3000.64]  You have set your glory in the heavens.
[3001.30 --> 3006.46]  Through the praise of children and infants, you have established a stronghold against your enemies
[3006.46 --> 3009.08]  to silence the foe and the avenger.
[3009.08 --> 3016.74]  When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars which you have set in place,
[3017.56 --> 3022.74]  what is mankind that you are mindful of them, human beings that you care for them?
[3024.02 --> 3028.90]  You have made them a little lower than the angels and crowned them with glory and honor.
[3029.68 --> 3032.24]  You made them rulers over the works of your hands.
[3032.24 --> 3038.14]  You put everything under their feet, all flocks and herds and the animals of the wild,
[3038.62 --> 3043.98]  the birds in the sky and the fish in the sea, all that swim in the paths of the sea.
[3045.00 --> 3048.76]  Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth.
[3048.76 --> 3053.76]  And Lord, you hear our prayers.
[3055.04 --> 3060.94]  It is amazing that you, creator of all the universe, care enough to listen to each one of our prayers.
[3061.40 --> 3062.74]  And we bring them to you now.
[3063.76 --> 3064.94]  We know that you listen.
[3065.60 --> 3066.72]  We know that you love.
[3067.28 --> 3073.38]  And we know that you work in almighty, wonderful, sovereign ways to bring about your plan.
[3073.38 --> 3080.38]  Help us to see this through the challenges that all of us face day to day,
[3080.82 --> 3086.28]  through the challenges that we see around us in our communities, in our country and in our world.
[3087.38 --> 3093.92]  It's easy for us to get overwhelmed and to sometimes assume that you aren't there, that you aren't listening.
[3095.36 --> 3099.02]  But your word tells us to hold on with eyes of faith,
[3099.02 --> 3104.32]  to be like the examples we see that we hear about again today from Hebrews.
[3105.78 --> 3109.84]  Help us to follow their example, to trust in your sovereign plan,
[3110.66 --> 3112.78]  knowing that you have all things in your hand.
[3115.04 --> 3122.22]  We pray for a blessing on our church as we begin to wrap up summer and move into a season of new ministries.
[3122.88 --> 3127.92]  We pray for your blessing, for fruit, for your spirit to dwell richly in all of the ministries.
[3127.92 --> 3130.30]  We pray for today.
[3130.86 --> 3134.48]  We pray for a blessing on Pastor Chris and the word that he's going to share with us.
[3135.18 --> 3138.10]  We also pray for a blessing on the Lord's Supper.
[3138.90 --> 3144.26]  And we thank you for another tangible evidence of your goodness and your grace and your love for us.
[3145.02 --> 3147.26]  Thank you for how you feed us and provide.
[3149.40 --> 3152.30]  Bless us today and the remainder of this week.
[3152.88 --> 3155.24]  And may we look to you with eyes of faith.
[3156.00 --> 3157.48]  We pray this in Jesus' name.
[3158.00 --> 3158.30]  Amen.
[3158.30 --> 3179.54]  As prayed and as you can see from the screen behind me,
[3179.54 --> 3187.62]  we're going to continue in our series looking at faith heroes using the list of characters from Hebrews 11,
[3187.82 --> 3193.42]  but then often reading part of their story where it occurs earlier in the Old Testament.
[3193.80 --> 3200.44]  This morning, we have a group of people who are going to come up and read for us from Genesis 27.
[3200.44 --> 3206.70]  And so if you have a Bible, I encourage you to open that up and then keep that open to Genesis 27.
[3207.16 --> 3210.24]  We're going to read verses 1 through 41.
[3210.72 --> 3215.50]  And so Rauchema girls and I think Olivia, who are going to read for us,
[3215.50 --> 3218.10]  why don't you come up to the front here.
[3219.88 --> 3223.58]  And then this will be your microphone and station.
[3223.58 --> 3244.94]  When Isaac was old and his eyes were so weak that he could no longer see,
[3245.32 --> 3248.86]  he called for Esau, his older son, and said to him,
[3248.86 --> 3249.78]  My son.
[3250.20 --> 3251.64]  Here I am, he answered.
[3252.16 --> 3256.24]  Isaac said, I am now an old man and don't know the day of my death.
[3256.64 --> 3259.22]  Now then, get your equipment, your quiver and bow,
[3259.46 --> 3262.92]  and go out to the open country and hunt some wild game for me.
[3263.50 --> 3266.92]  Prepare me the kind of tasty food I like and bring it to me to eat
[3266.92 --> 3269.64]  so that I may give you my blessing before I die.
[3269.64 --> 3273.74]  Now Rebekah was listening as Isaac spoke to his son Esau.
[3274.26 --> 3281.54]  When Esau left for the open country to hunt game and bring it back,
[3281.94 --> 3283.86]  Rebekah said to her son Jacob,
[3284.56 --> 3287.58]  Look, I overheard your father say to your brother Esau,
[3287.98 --> 3290.96]  Bring me some game and prepare me some tasty food to eat
[3290.96 --> 3295.36]  so that I may give you my blessing in the presence of the Lord before I die.
[3295.88 --> 3298.78]  Now, my son, listen carefully and do what I tell you.
[3298.78 --> 3302.26]  Go out to the flock and bring me two choice young goats
[3302.26 --> 3307.12]  so that I can prepare some tasty food for your father just the way he likes it.
[3307.74 --> 3312.32]  Then take it to your father to eat it so that he may give you his blessing before he dies.
[3313.10 --> 3315.08]  Jacob said to Rebekah, his mother,
[3315.70 --> 3318.98]  But my brother Esau is a hairy man while I have smooth skin.
[3319.42 --> 3320.86]  What if my father touches me?
[3321.02 --> 3325.28]  I would appear to be tricking him and would bring down a curse on myself rather than a blessing.
[3325.28 --> 3327.38]  His mother said to him,
[3327.82 --> 3329.72]  My son, let the curse fall on me.
[3330.06 --> 3331.08]  Just do what I say.
[3331.26 --> 3332.26]  Go and get them for me.
[3332.78 --> 3335.48]  So he went down and got them and brought them to his mother,
[3335.74 --> 3339.32]  and she prepared some tasty food just the way his father liked it.
[3339.96 --> 3343.64]  Then Rebekah took the best clothes of Esau, her older son,
[3343.96 --> 3345.60]  which she had in the house,
[3345.76 --> 3348.38]  and put them on her younger son, Jacob.
[3348.38 --> 3353.14]  She also covered his hands and the smooth part of his neck with the goat skins.
[3353.60 --> 3358.26]  Then she handed to her son Jacob the tasty food and the bread she had made.
[3358.64 --> 3360.32]  He went to his father and said,
[3360.72 --> 3361.28]  My father.
[3361.82 --> 3363.18]  Yes, my son, he answered.
[3363.40 --> 3364.08]  Who is it?
[3364.60 --> 3365.92]  Jacob said to his father,
[3366.30 --> 3367.98]  I am Esau, your firstborn.
[3368.26 --> 3369.58]  I have done as you told me.
[3369.82 --> 3373.72]  Please sit up and eat some of my game so that you may give me your blessing.
[3373.72 --> 3378.02]  Isaac asked his son,
[3378.58 --> 3381.22]  How did you find it so quickly, my son?
[3381.50 --> 3384.30]  The Lord your God gave me access, he replied.
[3384.64 --> 3385.90]  Then Isaac said to Jacob,
[3386.28 --> 3388.46]  Come near so I can touch you, my son,
[3388.72 --> 3392.58]  so I know whether you are really my son Esau or not.
[3393.20 --> 3396.16]  Jacob went close to his father Isaac,
[3396.16 --> 3397.74]  who touched him and said,
[3398.24 --> 3400.48]  The voice is the voice of Jacob,
[3400.90 --> 3403.68]  but the hands are of Esau.
[3404.18 --> 3405.62]  He did not recognize him,
[3405.88 --> 3409.32]  for his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau.
[3409.56 --> 3411.62]  But he proceeded to bless him.
[3412.18 --> 3412.88]  So you really,
[3413.98 --> 3415.64]  so you really,
[3416.72 --> 3419.08]  are you really my son Esau?
[3419.28 --> 3420.02]  He asked,
[3420.14 --> 3421.02]  I am, he replied.
[3421.42 --> 3422.18]  Then he said,
[3422.44 --> 3425.62]  My son, bring me some of your game to eat,
[3425.62 --> 3428.86]  so that I may give my blessing.
[3429.28 --> 3432.00]  Jacob brought it to him and he ate.
[3432.00 --> 3435.38]  And he brought some wine and he drank.
[3436.22 --> 3438.60]  Then his father Isaac told him,
[3439.30 --> 3441.06]  Come here, my son, and kiss me.
[3441.46 --> 3443.56]  So he went to him and kissed him.
[3444.04 --> 3446.54]  When Isaac caught the smell of his clothes,
[3446.90 --> 3448.04]  he blessed him and said,
[3448.48 --> 3452.42]  The smell of my son is like the smell of a field
[3452.42 --> 3454.32]  that the Lord has blessed.
[3454.32 --> 3459.72]  May God give you heaven's dew and earth's richness
[3459.72 --> 3462.44]  and abundance of grain and new wine.
[3463.06 --> 3466.36]  My nations serve you and peoples bow down to you.
[3466.72 --> 3469.16]  Be Lord over your brothers,
[3469.66 --> 3474.82]  and may the sons of your mother bow down to you.
[3474.82 --> 3477.66]  May those who curse you be cursed,
[3477.82 --> 3479.30]  and those who bless you be blessed.
[3479.74 --> 3482.44]  After Isaac has finished blessing him,
[3482.90 --> 3488.62]  and Jacob had scarcely left his father in presence,
[3489.30 --> 3492.54]  his brother Isaac came from hunting.
[3492.98 --> 3495.36]  He too prepared some tasty food
[3495.36 --> 3497.30]  and brought it to his father.
[3497.30 --> 3499.44]  Then he said to him,
[3499.74 --> 3502.88]  My father, please sit up and eat some of my game,
[3503.30 --> 3506.00]  so that you may give me your blessing.
[3506.38 --> 3507.92]  His father Isaac asked him,
[3508.12 --> 3508.82]  Who are you?
[3509.18 --> 3510.62]  I am your son, he answered,
[3510.84 --> 3511.96]  your firstborn Esau.
[3513.86 --> 3516.48]  Isaac trembled violently and said,
[3516.58 --> 3518.86]  Who was it then that hunted game and brought it to me?
[3519.10 --> 3521.22]  I ate it just before you came, and I blessed him,
[3521.32 --> 3522.50]  and indeed he will be blessed.
[3522.88 --> 3524.58]  When Esau heard his father's words,
[3524.58 --> 3526.40]  he burst out with a loud and bitter cry
[3526.40 --> 3527.36]  and said to his father,
[3527.78 --> 3529.10]  Bless me, me too, my father.
[3529.38 --> 3530.34]  But he said,
[3530.52 --> 3533.08]  Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing.
[3533.64 --> 3534.30]  Esau said,
[3534.48 --> 3535.84]  Isn't he rightly named Jacob?
[3536.08 --> 3538.70]  This is the second time he has taken advantage of me.
[3539.00 --> 3540.00]  He took my birthright,
[3540.10 --> 3541.56]  and now he has taken my blessing.
[3542.00 --> 3542.66]  Then he asked,
[3542.82 --> 3544.84]  Haven't you reserved any blessing for me?
[3545.32 --> 3546.52]  Isaac answered Esau,
[3546.78 --> 3548.36]  I have made him Lord over you
[3548.36 --> 3550.70]  and have made all of his relatives his servants,
[3551.34 --> 3553.82]  and I have sustained him with grain and new wine.
[3553.82 --> 3555.92]  So what can I possibly do for you, my son?
[3556.42 --> 3557.64]  Esau said to his father,
[3557.84 --> 3559.88]  Do you have only one blessing, my father?
[3560.24 --> 3561.40]  Bless me too, my father.
[3561.82 --> 3563.14]  Then Esau wept out loud.
[3563.56 --> 3565.04]  His father Isaac answered him,
[3565.44 --> 3567.58]  Your dwelling will be away from the earth's richness,
[3567.92 --> 3569.54]  away from the dew of heaven above.
[3569.92 --> 3570.98]  You will live by the sword,
[3571.10 --> 3572.12]  and you will serve your brother.
[3572.48 --> 3573.54]  But when you grow restless,
[3573.78 --> 3575.72]  you will throw his yoke off from your neck.
[3576.18 --> 3578.22]  Esau held a grudge against Jacob
[3578.22 --> 3580.58]  because of the blessing his father had given him.
[3580.92 --> 3581.80]  He said to himself,
[3581.80 --> 3583.94]  If the days of mourning for my father are near,
[3584.26 --> 3585.66]  then I'll kill my brother Jacob.
[3585.94 --> 3587.20]  This is the word of the Lord.
[3587.20 --> 3617.18]  Thank you.
[3617.20 --> 3623.06]  Isaac is long and there's a ton in it that we could reflect on.
[3623.90 --> 3628.46]  And so we're going to kind of move really quickly for the sake of our time together
[3628.46 --> 3634.82]  and have one particular focus that comes from Genesis 27 where we read.
[3635.68 --> 3639.92]  But for you who may not be as familiar with the story,
[3640.50 --> 3645.90]  Isaac is born the second of two sons to Abraham.
[3645.90 --> 3653.76]  His older brother, Ishmael, is a fascinating story in its own right and worthy of study.
[3654.66 --> 3658.70]  But Isaac is the son of promise, right?
[3658.74 --> 3664.46]  He's the one who was promised to Abraham through whom Abraham would become a great nation.
[3664.46 --> 3673.22]  Now, as a young boy in Isaac's story, he's taken up a mountain by his father Abraham
[3673.22 --> 3681.62]  to possibly be the object of child sacrifice, a test that God had laid on his father Abraham.
[3682.16 --> 3688.22]  And that too is another fascinating story, one that was referenced in Abraham's story,
[3688.22 --> 3689.80]  which we looked at before.
[3690.72 --> 3696.48]  But by God's grace, Isaac is rescued and a ram is provided in his place.
[3697.48 --> 3702.66]  Because he is rescued and because a ram is offered up in his place, Isaac grows up.
[3703.00 --> 3704.64]  He becomes a man.
[3704.76 --> 3706.66]  He marries Rebecca.
[3706.66 --> 3714.10]  And with his wife Rebecca, he repeats some of the same sins of his father Abraham
[3714.10 --> 3719.38]  by lying to people about his relationship to her, saying that she is his sister.
[3721.16 --> 3725.40]  Eventually, Isaac inherits everything from his father Abraham.
[3726.18 --> 3730.40]  And he has his own children, who we know as Jacob and Esau.
[3730.72 --> 3734.62]  Jacob and Esau have a very contentious relationship from the beginning.
[3734.62 --> 3736.32]  They are born as twins.
[3736.82 --> 3739.76]  Esau, the older brother, comes out first.
[3740.22 --> 3743.10]  But Jacob comes out grasping at his heel.
[3744.70 --> 3747.42]  Esau grows to become Abraham's favorite.
[3748.06 --> 3751.06]  Jacob grows to become Rebecca's favorite.
[3752.16 --> 3757.52]  In their story, Jacob connives away to take his brother's birthright
[3757.52 --> 3759.40]  for the price of a bowl of soup.
[3759.40 --> 3764.38]  And as we read in Genesis 27, as the girls read for us,
[3764.68 --> 3766.48]  Isaac is duped.
[3767.48 --> 3773.98]  And Esau's blessing, like the birthright, is stolen by Jacob and Rebecca's scheming.
[3776.48 --> 3782.54]  But it's right there that the story, for our purposes at least this morning,
[3783.06 --> 3784.58]  gets really interesting.
[3784.58 --> 3792.78]  Because it's Jacob's scheming and Isaac being duped by his son
[3792.78 --> 3800.28]  that Isaac emerges as a faith hero, according to Hebrews 11.
[3801.42 --> 3803.50]  Now that seems crazy to me.
[3805.18 --> 3808.72]  Here's a man who is tricked, right?
[3808.72 --> 3815.20]  And yet somehow, God is in control of even these situations,
[3815.90 --> 3816.92]  even this circumstance.
[3818.52 --> 3822.26]  Now, in most cases, when you're reading your Bible,
[3822.74 --> 3829.28]  it's not a good idea to try and assume or discern the intentions of biblical characters
[3829.28 --> 3832.88]  in the story unless the Bible tells you their intentions.
[3832.88 --> 3833.32]  Right?
[3834.08 --> 3840.20]  Just like it's not wise to assume or to make conclusions about the intentions of people
[3840.20 --> 3842.98]  in your life unless they tell you those intentions.
[3843.80 --> 3846.06]  That's where miscommunication comes.
[3846.94 --> 3849.60]  But it's clear, I think, in this text,
[3850.02 --> 3855.26]  that Jacob and Rebecca's intentions are deceitful and are for dishonest gain.
[3855.26 --> 3860.40]  And yet, what we see throughout is that God is sovereign
[3860.40 --> 3865.34]  and that God uses Isaac to accomplish what we're going to call this morning
[3865.34 --> 3867.30]  his covenant purposes.
[3869.12 --> 3873.56]  And so I've made reference already, but Hebrews 11 verse 20 says,
[3874.74 --> 3881.00]  By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future.
[3881.00 --> 3889.58]  Now, if you are like me, I have a tendency to default to skepticism.
[3890.18 --> 3894.68]  And sometimes that default grows a little bit too strong and it becomes cynicism.
[3895.36 --> 3898.52]  And so I'm going to say, with candidness in front of you,
[3898.88 --> 3900.90]  the first time I read this,
[3901.96 --> 3905.30]  I kind of wondered if maybe this was a whitewashing of history.
[3905.30 --> 3905.98]  Right?
[3907.06 --> 3912.26]  Is this the sake of sanitizing a story for the sake of those who come after?
[3913.24 --> 3913.78]  But you know what?
[3913.80 --> 3914.90]  I don't think it is.
[3917.00 --> 3921.02]  Maybe you were here this summer when we looked at the story of Joseph,
[3922.20 --> 3923.94]  another faith hero.
[3924.70 --> 3927.02]  But in Genesis 50 verse 20,
[3927.54 --> 3930.86]  Joseph is standing in front of his brothers who lied to him,
[3930.94 --> 3932.72]  who sold him into slavery,
[3932.72 --> 3936.88]  who lied to their father saying that he was dead and killed by animals.
[3937.76 --> 3939.66]  And Joseph says to them,
[3940.00 --> 3942.00]  You intended to harm me,
[3942.50 --> 3945.08]  but God intended it for good,
[3945.34 --> 3947.74]  to accomplish what is now being done,
[3948.04 --> 3949.80]  the saving of many lives.
[3951.02 --> 3951.20]  Right?
[3951.28 --> 3954.28]  God is so sovereign, we saw in that story,
[3954.28 --> 3957.72]  that he is able to use the sin-filled intentions
[3957.72 --> 3961.08]  of humans for his purposes,
[3961.50 --> 3962.50]  for his good,
[3962.64 --> 3964.62]  for the redemption of his people,
[3964.86 --> 3967.84]  for the fulfilling of his covenant promises.
[3969.20 --> 3972.82]  What I suggest to you is that the same sort of thing
[3972.82 --> 3975.76]  is happening in Isaac's story.
[3977.02 --> 3977.14]  Right?
[3977.28 --> 3980.58]  Jacob intends to deceive his father.
[3981.34 --> 3984.34]  Esau is given short shrift in the blessing,
[3984.34 --> 3986.24]  and Isaac, throughout it all,
[3986.32 --> 3987.40]  doesn't know any better.
[3988.52 --> 3988.78]  Right?
[3988.82 --> 3990.00]  He too is a skeptic.
[3990.06 --> 3991.02]  He asks questions.
[3991.12 --> 3992.08]  He tries to discern,
[3992.40 --> 3993.80]  but he gets duped.
[3993.88 --> 3996.40]  And yet, like Hebrews 11 verse 20 says,
[3996.74 --> 3999.56]  By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau
[3999.56 --> 4000.68]  in regard to their future.
[4001.06 --> 4001.90]  This act,
[4002.94 --> 4004.44]  even with all the dishonest gain,
[4004.58 --> 4005.62]  even with all the deceit,
[4005.62 --> 4007.36]  even with all the doubt and questioning,
[4007.70 --> 4009.98]  is credited to Isaac
[4009.98 --> 4012.12]  as an act of faith.
[4012.12 --> 4015.30]  Even though he didn't fully understand
[4015.30 --> 4017.80]  all that God was doing in the midst of it.
[4019.50 --> 4020.96]  It is an act of faith.
[4022.86 --> 4024.52]  And maybe, maybe,
[4024.72 --> 4025.96]  that's the big idea
[4025.96 --> 4028.32]  that we need to hear this morning.
[4029.26 --> 4029.58]  Right?
[4029.70 --> 4032.68]  Even though Isaac did not realize
[4032.68 --> 4036.06]  everything that God was doing in that moment,
[4037.00 --> 4039.54]  Isaac is a faith hero for us
[4039.54 --> 4042.54]  because he blessed Jacob and Esau
[4042.54 --> 4044.28]  in regards to their future,
[4044.48 --> 4047.58]  even while he was on or near his deathbed.
[4048.54 --> 4049.72]  And so, hear that.
[4050.82 --> 4050.98]  Right?
[4051.20 --> 4054.54]  You will never be able to
[4054.54 --> 4057.06]  fully realize or recognize
[4057.06 --> 4059.04]  or identify everything
[4059.04 --> 4061.50]  that God is doing in the moment.
[4061.50 --> 4064.08]  But like Isaac,
[4064.64 --> 4066.50]  you can respond faithfully
[4066.50 --> 4068.38]  to his covenant promises,
[4068.64 --> 4070.46]  to God's covenant promises.
[4072.90 --> 4074.72]  In the face of death,
[4075.88 --> 4076.96]  Isaac believed
[4076.96 --> 4078.48]  in the covenant promises of God
[4078.48 --> 4080.38]  for a better country,
[4081.10 --> 4082.50]  for a heavenly one,
[4082.56 --> 4084.12]  a city whose foundations
[4084.12 --> 4087.14]  and architect and builder is God.
[4087.14 --> 4089.82]  And there's a running theme
[4089.82 --> 4092.62]  that builds through Hebrews 11.
[4092.72 --> 4093.78]  If you have your Bibles open,
[4094.08 --> 4094.94]  I'm going to encourage you
[4094.94 --> 4096.00]  to find Hebrews 11
[4096.00 --> 4099.48]  and maybe put a paper in Genesis 27
[4099.48 --> 4100.78]  as we'll come back and flip
[4100.78 --> 4102.74]  or have Hebrews 11.
[4104.12 --> 4105.62]  Anyway, have that in front of you.
[4105.82 --> 4107.22]  There's this long section
[4107.22 --> 4108.80]  starting in verse 8
[4108.80 --> 4110.22]  on the faith of Abraham.
[4111.14 --> 4111.62]  Right?
[4111.96 --> 4114.94]  And that ends with Abraham reasoning
[4114.94 --> 4116.78]  that God could raise the dead.
[4118.10 --> 4120.40]  And so, part of what we are seeing
[4120.40 --> 4122.02]  and we've looked at before
[4122.02 --> 4124.76]  is that in the face of death,
[4125.04 --> 4126.50]  faith heroes hang on
[4126.50 --> 4127.76]  to the promises of God.
[4128.24 --> 4130.28]  Even when, perhaps especially when,
[4130.48 --> 4132.44]  we can't understand God's purposes.
[4133.38 --> 4134.66]  Even when we can't see
[4134.66 --> 4136.80]  what God's intentions might be
[4136.80 --> 4138.80]  in that particular moment.
[4140.00 --> 4141.46]  And then it goes through,
[4141.60 --> 4143.34]  each one following, right,
[4143.34 --> 4145.94]  refers to receive him back from death
[4145.94 --> 4149.14]  or bless them in regards
[4149.14 --> 4149.76]  to their future
[4149.76 --> 4151.04]  when he was near death.
[4151.26 --> 4152.38]  And verse 21,
[4152.54 --> 4154.34]  by faith Jacob when he was dying.
[4154.48 --> 4156.06]  Verse 22, by faith Joseph
[4156.06 --> 4157.24]  when his end was near.
[4158.32 --> 4158.56]  Right?
[4158.70 --> 4160.18]  We've looked at these stories
[4160.18 --> 4163.78]  and so part of what's going on here
[4163.78 --> 4166.84]  is faithfulness throughout life
[4166.84 --> 4169.76]  but also in particular at the end.
[4169.76 --> 4173.28]  And then part of what's going on
[4173.28 --> 4176.62]  in the backstory to Jacob and Esau
[4176.62 --> 4181.24]  is the question of who rightly,
[4181.92 --> 4183.76]  according to particular standards,
[4184.26 --> 4185.74]  gets the blessing
[4185.74 --> 4188.62]  or who rightly will receive
[4188.62 --> 4190.50]  the lion's share
[4190.50 --> 4192.58]  or the bigger portion of that blessing.
[4193.42 --> 4195.60]  Because normally in that culture
[4195.60 --> 4197.54]  and actually throughout much of history,
[4197.54 --> 4201.06]  the custom is for the firstborn
[4201.06 --> 4202.76]  to get the larger share
[4202.76 --> 4203.50]  of the inheritance,
[4203.88 --> 4204.88]  to get the blessing.
[4205.82 --> 4207.20]  We've talked about this before.
[4207.48 --> 4210.12]  This is called the rule of primogeniture.
[4210.98 --> 4211.10]  Right?
[4211.18 --> 4213.04]  Primo meaning first geniture.
[4213.20 --> 4214.50]  You can hear the root word in there,
[4214.64 --> 4216.10]  generations, right,
[4216.18 --> 4216.82]  being born.
[4216.94 --> 4217.82]  So the firstborn.
[4219.40 --> 4221.54]  And in the ordinary economy
[4222.08 --> 4223.42]  of human operations
[4223.42 --> 4224.60]  throughout history,
[4224.60 --> 4226.44]  it is the firstborn
[4226.44 --> 4228.56]  and usually in most cultures
[4228.56 --> 4229.90]  the firstborn son
[4229.90 --> 4231.92]  that receives the inheritance,
[4232.18 --> 4234.66]  that receives the lion's share
[4234.66 --> 4235.44]  of the blessing.
[4236.64 --> 4239.34]  But over and over and over
[4239.34 --> 4240.28]  in the Bible,
[4240.70 --> 4241.92]  what we begin to see
[4241.92 --> 4243.20]  is that God's ways
[4243.20 --> 4244.76]  are not our ways.
[4245.22 --> 4246.72]  That God is not bound
[4246.72 --> 4248.10]  by the customs of men
[4248.10 --> 4249.78]  and so his purposes
[4249.78 --> 4251.76]  and his electing power
[4251.76 --> 4253.46]  are often worked out
[4253.46 --> 4255.36]  in unordinary ways,
[4256.06 --> 4257.26]  in ways that don't match
[4257.26 --> 4259.48]  with what our cultural expectation
[4259.48 --> 4260.54]  might be.
[4261.20 --> 4261.54]  In fact,
[4261.64 --> 4264.02]  God regularly inverts expectations
[4264.02 --> 4266.22]  to show that his power
[4266.22 --> 4267.36]  is made perfect
[4267.36 --> 4268.54]  in human weakness.
[4269.56 --> 4269.68]  Right?
[4269.74 --> 4270.68]  God regularly works
[4270.68 --> 4271.82]  to show that the last
[4271.82 --> 4272.66]  shall be first
[4272.66 --> 4273.74]  or that the greatest
[4273.74 --> 4274.70]  are made low
[4274.70 --> 4275.70]  and that the lowest
[4275.70 --> 4276.56]  are lifted up
[4276.56 --> 4277.86]  to the right hand of the king.
[4278.18 --> 4278.90]  And you see this
[4278.90 --> 4280.16]  over and over and over
[4280.16 --> 4280.70]  in the Bible.
[4280.90 --> 4281.92]  Just to trace it through
[4281.92 --> 4282.94]  the stories we've already
[4282.94 --> 4283.86]  looked at this summer,
[4284.40 --> 4286.16]  the weaker and younger Abel
[4286.16 --> 4288.32]  is chosen over the stronger
[4288.32 --> 4289.72]  and older Cain.
[4290.64 --> 4292.48]  Isaac is the son of the promise,
[4292.60 --> 4293.70]  but he's not the firstborn.
[4294.04 --> 4295.12]  That's Ishmael.
[4295.82 --> 4296.96]  And now it is Jacob,
[4297.66 --> 4299.66]  weaker and younger than Esau,
[4300.12 --> 4300.96]  who gets the blessing.
[4303.62 --> 4306.52]  Quoting Romans 2 and Romans 9,
[4306.52 --> 4308.60]  Bible scholar,
[4308.82 --> 4310.30]  theologian Philip Hughes
[4310.30 --> 4311.78]  sums it up well.
[4311.86 --> 4313.02]  And I'll share this with you.
[4313.80 --> 4314.36]  He writes,
[4314.68 --> 4316.62]  The message is clear.
[4317.50 --> 4318.86]  The line of promise
[4318.86 --> 4320.48]  is not the line of flesh,
[4320.48 --> 4322.04]  but the line of faith.
[4322.76 --> 4323.76]  The true heir
[4323.76 --> 4325.26]  is not the outward heir,
[4325.38 --> 4326.96]  but the inward heir.
[4327.76 --> 4329.18]  Not all who are descended
[4329.18 --> 4329.90]  from Israel
[4329.90 --> 4331.16]  belong to Israel.
[4331.56 --> 4332.60]  Not all who are children
[4332.60 --> 4333.48]  of Abraham,
[4333.48 --> 4336.06]  not all are children of Abraham,
[4336.20 --> 4337.64]  because they are descendants.
[4339.26 --> 4340.80]  Not the line of flesh,
[4341.10 --> 4343.28]  but the line of faith.
[4345.62 --> 4346.78]  And here's the thing.
[4348.70 --> 4350.80]  It's so easy
[4350.80 --> 4354.08]  for us to think of faith
[4354.08 --> 4356.86]  as a work that we do.
[4358.12 --> 4358.66]  And of course,
[4358.78 --> 4359.52]  in one sense,
[4359.78 --> 4360.78]  that's true, right?
[4360.78 --> 4362.78]  Like, colloquially,
[4362.78 --> 4365.60]  we use the word faith,
[4365.90 --> 4367.20]  and that requires action.
[4367.40 --> 4368.96]  Faith calls forth
[4368.96 --> 4369.90]  a response
[4369.90 --> 4371.08]  on our part.
[4371.80 --> 4373.44]  But the kind of faith
[4373.44 --> 4374.58]  that identifies
[4374.58 --> 4376.10]  Jacob
[4376.10 --> 4377.36]  as the agent
[4377.36 --> 4379.42]  of God's covenant promise,
[4379.60 --> 4380.38]  through whom
[4380.38 --> 4381.20]  the whole story
[4381.20 --> 4381.74]  of redemption
[4381.74 --> 4382.58]  would continue,
[4383.00 --> 4384.10]  the kind of faith
[4384.10 --> 4385.52]  that identifies Isaac,
[4385.88 --> 4386.92]  and before him
[4386.92 --> 4388.22]  identified Abraham,
[4388.22 --> 4391.54]  as part of the covenant promise,
[4391.70 --> 4393.72]  that kind of faith
[4393.72 --> 4394.38]  is rooted
[4394.38 --> 4396.02]  only in
[4396.02 --> 4397.72]  God's choosing.
[4399.44 --> 4399.58]  Right?
[4399.72 --> 4400.62]  God chose
[4400.62 --> 4401.26]  Jacob,
[4402.22 --> 4403.96]  and therefore,
[4404.94 --> 4406.06]  through Isaac,
[4406.58 --> 4407.36]  God blessed him.
[4409.04 --> 4409.42]  And look,
[4410.20 --> 4413.64]  this is going to be contentious
[4413.64 --> 4414.94]  for some of you.
[4415.86 --> 4416.78]  That this is going to be
[4416.78 --> 4417.54]  a hard truth
[4417.54 --> 4419.04]  to wrestle with.
[4420.50 --> 4421.84]  And the prophet Malachi
[4421.84 --> 4422.76]  actually makes
[4422.76 --> 4423.56]  the same point
[4423.56 --> 4425.10]  that we are making now.
[4425.20 --> 4426.52]  In Malachi chapter 1,
[4426.60 --> 4427.70]  verse 2 and 3,
[4428.22 --> 4429.02]  he says,
[4429.70 --> 4432.02]  Yet I have loved Jacob,
[4432.20 --> 4433.14]  this is God speaking,
[4433.70 --> 4434.54]  but Esau
[4434.54 --> 4436.08]  I have hated.
[4438.76 --> 4440.12]  That's the language
[4440.12 --> 4442.26]  of covenant choosing.
[4443.38 --> 4443.60]  Right?
[4443.62 --> 4444.38]  This is the language
[4444.38 --> 4445.22]  of election.
[4445.22 --> 4446.62]  And I know
[4446.62 --> 4447.34]  some of you are
[4447.34 --> 4449.94]  but God
[4449.94 --> 4450.78]  who is sovereign
[4450.78 --> 4451.62]  over all,
[4451.80 --> 4452.56]  who rules
[4452.56 --> 4453.36]  and reigns
[4453.36 --> 4454.20]  and acts
[4454.20 --> 4455.30]  with providence,
[4455.50 --> 4456.00]  that is,
[4456.10 --> 4457.44]  that all that happens
[4457.44 --> 4457.96]  in the world
[4457.96 --> 4459.50]  happens by his hand.
[4459.76 --> 4460.98]  He directs history
[4460.98 --> 4461.90]  and has chosen
[4461.90 --> 4462.88]  its outcome,
[4463.14 --> 4463.86]  and he directs
[4463.86 --> 4464.96]  the means also
[4464.96 --> 4466.46]  by which we get there.
[4466.58 --> 4466.94]  And so,
[4467.08 --> 4467.98]  what he does
[4467.98 --> 4469.06]  in the world,
[4469.44 --> 4471.18]  he does primarily
[4471.18 --> 4472.44]  then through
[4472.44 --> 4473.72]  his agents,
[4473.72 --> 4475.56]  through his image bearers,
[4475.90 --> 4477.18]  through his chosen people.
[4479.00 --> 4479.10]  Right?
[4479.24 --> 4481.06]  Isaac blessing Jacob
[4481.06 --> 4482.76]  helps us to see
[4482.76 --> 4483.96]  that it's not
[4483.96 --> 4485.76]  the ordinary means
[4485.76 --> 4486.94]  of flesh
[4486.94 --> 4488.22]  or of power
[4488.22 --> 4489.42]  or of privilege.
[4489.78 --> 4491.30]  It's not the ordinary means
[4491.30 --> 4492.02]  of popularity
[4492.02 --> 4493.54]  or democratic rule
[4493.54 --> 4494.52]  that God makes
[4494.52 --> 4495.60]  his selection by,
[4495.60 --> 4498.48]  but it is by grace
[4498.48 --> 4500.44]  through faith.
[4500.44 --> 4502.56]  And in fact,
[4502.62 --> 4503.42]  we can keep adding
[4503.42 --> 4504.64]  on how contentious
[4504.64 --> 4505.24]  this is
[4505.24 --> 4506.18]  because Jesus
[4506.18 --> 4507.54]  makes the same point.
[4508.54 --> 4509.40]  In Luke 14,
[4509.66 --> 4510.00]  Jesus,
[4510.60 --> 4511.32]  talking to
[4511.32 --> 4512.48]  the large crowds
[4512.48 --> 4513.08]  that have gathered,
[4513.20 --> 4513.86]  we can read this.
[4513.94 --> 4514.16]  He says,
[4514.16 --> 4516.30]  large crowds
[4516.30 --> 4516.90]  were traveling
[4516.90 --> 4517.50]  with Jesus
[4517.50 --> 4519.04]  and turning to them,
[4519.14 --> 4519.66]  he said,
[4520.58 --> 4521.64]  if anyone comes
[4521.64 --> 4522.24]  to me
[4522.24 --> 4523.14]  and does not
[4523.14 --> 4524.10]  hate father
[4524.10 --> 4525.04]  or mother,
[4525.58 --> 4526.78]  wife and children,
[4527.26 --> 4528.30]  brothers and sisters,
[4528.56 --> 4528.82]  yes,
[4528.96 --> 4530.58]  even their own life,
[4531.02 --> 4531.70]  such a person
[4531.70 --> 4533.04]  cannot be my disciple.
[4533.76 --> 4534.22]  And whoever
[4534.22 --> 4535.02]  does not carry
[4535.02 --> 4535.70]  their cross
[4535.70 --> 4536.64]  and follow me
[4536.64 --> 4537.72]  cannot be
[4537.72 --> 4539.14]  my disciple.
[4541.98 --> 4543.32]  Jesus' point
[4543.32 --> 4545.40]  is that you must
[4545.40 --> 4546.66]  choose God
[4546.66 --> 4548.30]  over any other
[4548.30 --> 4548.88]  relationship.
[4550.10 --> 4551.16]  You must choose
[4551.16 --> 4551.82]  the relationship
[4551.82 --> 4552.64]  of faith
[4552.64 --> 4554.68]  over the relationship
[4554.68 --> 4555.32]  of flesh.
[4557.12 --> 4557.54]  Now,
[4557.60 --> 4558.18]  like we said,
[4558.64 --> 4559.36]  this is a really
[4559.36 --> 4560.28]  hard word
[4560.28 --> 4561.94]  for many of us.
[4563.42 --> 4564.22]  Part of why
[4564.22 --> 4564.98]  it's so hard
[4564.98 --> 4565.90]  for most of us
[4565.90 --> 4566.74]  is because
[4566.74 --> 4568.74]  most of us,
[4568.78 --> 4569.64]  if not all of us,
[4569.82 --> 4570.80]  have made an idol
[4570.80 --> 4572.30]  out of our families.
[4573.32 --> 4575.44]  Many of us
[4575.44 --> 4576.08]  think about
[4576.08 --> 4577.60]  our biological families
[4577.60 --> 4578.54]  as being more
[4578.54 --> 4579.46]  closely related
[4579.46 --> 4580.02]  to us
[4580.02 --> 4580.84]  than our family
[4580.84 --> 4581.32]  of faith.
[4582.52 --> 4583.60]  And I get it.
[4584.30 --> 4584.72]  And please,
[4584.96 --> 4585.68]  don't hear what
[4585.68 --> 4586.14]  I'm not saying.
[4586.22 --> 4586.80]  I don't want
[4586.80 --> 4587.70]  to be insensitive.
[4588.48 --> 4589.20]  Because yes,
[4589.34 --> 4590.16]  all of us,
[4590.42 --> 4591.24]  all of us
[4591.24 --> 4592.10]  have a family member,
[4592.20 --> 4593.42]  a son or a daughter,
[4593.56 --> 4594.46]  a brother or a sister
[4594.46 --> 4595.02]  or an uncle
[4595.02 --> 4595.58]  or an aunt,
[4595.92 --> 4597.14]  someone who no longer
[4597.14 --> 4597.60]  believes
[4597.60 --> 4598.16]  or who maybe
[4598.16 --> 4599.34]  never believed.
[4599.34 --> 4601.70]  But one of the reasons
[4601.70 --> 4602.38]  I'm going to suggest
[4602.38 --> 4603.14]  that that breaks
[4603.14 --> 4603.84]  our heart
[4603.84 --> 4605.24]  is because we know
[4605.24 --> 4606.16]  that the relationship
[4606.16 --> 4606.72]  to God,
[4606.78 --> 4607.16]  our Father,
[4607.26 --> 4608.10]  through Jesus Christ,
[4608.26 --> 4608.78]  our Lord,
[4608.84 --> 4609.82]  is more important
[4609.82 --> 4610.94]  and more meaningful
[4610.94 --> 4611.98]  and more valuable
[4611.98 --> 4613.92]  than even our relationship
[4613.92 --> 4615.36]  to sons and daughters,
[4615.46 --> 4616.40]  even our relationships
[4616.40 --> 4617.54]  as family members.
[4620.10 --> 4621.18]  The truth,
[4621.18 --> 4624.48]  the truth is
[4624.48 --> 4625.44]  that where it matters
[4625.44 --> 4626.22]  most,
[4626.90 --> 4628.52]  at the level of belief
[4628.52 --> 4629.50]  and faith,
[4629.58 --> 4630.88]  at the level of identity
[4630.88 --> 4632.58]  as a son or daughter
[4632.58 --> 4633.46]  of God,
[4634.34 --> 4635.62]  where it matters most,
[4635.74 --> 4636.72]  you share more
[4636.72 --> 4637.46]  in common
[4637.46 --> 4638.50]  with a brother
[4638.50 --> 4640.00]  or sister in Christ
[4640.00 --> 4641.50]  than you do
[4641.50 --> 4641.94]  with someone
[4641.94 --> 4642.88]  who does not believe.
[4645.66 --> 4646.62]  And if you aren't
[4646.62 --> 4647.50]  sure about this,
[4648.56 --> 4650.78]  talk to the believing woman
[4650.78 --> 4652.18]  whose husband
[4652.18 --> 4653.40]  refuses to believe.
[4655.36 --> 4655.56]  Right?
[4655.60 --> 4656.36]  Not sharing
[4656.36 --> 4657.20]  that identity
[4657.20 --> 4657.82]  on the level
[4657.82 --> 4659.04]  of faith and belief
[4659.04 --> 4660.44]  makes every other
[4660.44 --> 4662.14]  connection difficult.
[4662.98 --> 4663.20]  Right?
[4663.22 --> 4663.88]  Not impossible,
[4664.58 --> 4665.64]  but more difficult
[4665.64 --> 4666.86]  than it would otherwise be
[4666.86 --> 4668.28]  and often
[4668.28 --> 4670.16]  not as deep
[4670.16 --> 4672.06]  as she would desire.
[4674.02 --> 4674.38]  And so,
[4675.32 --> 4675.92]  young men,
[4676.58 --> 4677.20]  young women,
[4677.82 --> 4679.12]  think very carefully
[4679.12 --> 4680.64]  before you date someone
[4680.64 --> 4682.08]  who doesn't share
[4682.08 --> 4683.16]  your belief.
[4686.22 --> 4688.22]  The story of Isaac
[4688.22 --> 4690.24]  as a faith hero
[4690.24 --> 4691.96]  underscores
[4691.96 --> 4694.14]  the relational identity
[4694.14 --> 4695.50]  that we share
[4695.50 --> 4696.24]  to God
[4696.24 --> 4697.34]  through faith
[4697.34 --> 4698.38]  as the single
[4698.38 --> 4699.56]  most determining
[4699.56 --> 4700.44]  factor
[4700.44 --> 4701.62]  for our lives
[4701.62 --> 4702.18]  in the world.
[4704.22 --> 4705.82]  Isaac was used
[4705.82 --> 4706.38]  of God
[4706.38 --> 4707.04]  to bless
[4707.04 --> 4707.76]  Jacob,
[4707.92 --> 4708.70]  to move
[4708.70 --> 4709.30]  the drama
[4709.30 --> 4710.20]  of redemption
[4710.20 --> 4711.16]  forward.
[4711.74 --> 4711.88]  And so,
[4711.96 --> 4712.96]  look at the blessing,
[4713.16 --> 4713.90]  and here we'll jump back
[4713.90 --> 4715.22]  to Genesis 27 now.
[4716.22 --> 4717.22]  Look at the blessing
[4717.22 --> 4718.66]  that Jacob,
[4720.22 --> 4720.94]  or that Isaac,
[4721.14 --> 4722.60]  speaks over Jacob
[4722.60 --> 4724.60]  in our text,
[4724.76 --> 4726.64]  starting in verse 28.
[4726.64 --> 4729.82]  May God give you
[4729.82 --> 4730.86]  heaven's due
[4730.86 --> 4732.74]  and earth's riches,
[4733.28 --> 4733.78]  an abundance
[4733.78 --> 4734.68]  of grain
[4734.68 --> 4736.58]  and new wine.
[4737.36 --> 4738.32]  May nations
[4738.32 --> 4739.12]  serve you
[4739.12 --> 4739.92]  and peoples
[4739.92 --> 4740.86]  bow down
[4740.86 --> 4741.60]  to you.
[4742.28 --> 4743.10]  Be Lord
[4743.10 --> 4744.06]  over your brothers
[4744.06 --> 4745.54]  and may the sons
[4745.54 --> 4746.32]  of your mother
[4746.32 --> 4747.46]  bow down to you.
[4747.60 --> 4748.68]  May those who curse
[4748.68 --> 4749.56]  you be cursed
[4749.56 --> 4750.78]  and those who bless
[4750.78 --> 4751.24]  you
[4751.24 --> 4752.76]  be blessed.
[4752.76 --> 4754.36]  Now,
[4754.42 --> 4755.24]  in those words,
[4755.34 --> 4756.16]  you might hear
[4756.16 --> 4757.04]  an echo
[4757.04 --> 4758.26]  of God's promise
[4758.26 --> 4759.62]  spoken to Abraham.
[4760.26 --> 4761.20]  And in those words,
[4761.26 --> 4762.02]  you will hear
[4762.02 --> 4762.68]  a sort of
[4762.68 --> 4764.36]  anticipation echo
[4764.36 --> 4765.52]  of the language
[4765.52 --> 4766.70]  that God will speak
[4766.70 --> 4767.58]  to Joseph.
[4769.06 --> 4769.40]  Right?
[4769.46 --> 4770.10]  A promise
[4770.10 --> 4771.36]  first to make him
[4771.36 --> 4772.24]  into a great nation
[4772.24 --> 4773.30]  and then to Joseph
[4773.30 --> 4774.08]  for brothers
[4774.08 --> 4774.94]  to bow down
[4774.94 --> 4776.04]  and then the promise
[4776.04 --> 4776.76]  back to Abraham
[4776.76 --> 4777.62]  for those who curse
[4777.62 --> 4778.82]  you to be cursed
[4778.82 --> 4779.62]  and those who bless
[4779.62 --> 4781.14]  you to be blessed.
[4781.14 --> 4782.48]  But then,
[4782.90 --> 4784.16]  listen in contrast
[4784.16 --> 4785.40]  to the words
[4785.40 --> 4786.18]  that Isaac
[4786.18 --> 4787.04]  speaks
[4787.04 --> 4788.42]  to Esau.
[4788.78 --> 4789.42]  Flip the page
[4789.42 --> 4790.24]  or at least in my Bible,
[4790.38 --> 4790.98]  flip the page,
[4791.08 --> 4791.80]  verse 39.
[4793.60 --> 4794.44]  Your dwelling
[4794.44 --> 4795.50]  will be away
[4795.50 --> 4797.12]  from the earth's riches,
[4797.36 --> 4798.52]  away from the dew
[4798.52 --> 4799.74]  of heaven above.
[4800.46 --> 4801.08]  Now notice
[4801.08 --> 4801.84]  carefully
[4801.84 --> 4802.88]  how that's
[4802.88 --> 4804.32]  the opposite language
[4804.32 --> 4806.00]  of Jacob's blessing.
[4806.82 --> 4807.54]  And he continues,
[4808.06 --> 4809.08]  you will live
[4809.08 --> 4809.76]  by the sword
[4809.76 --> 4810.72]  and you will serve
[4810.72 --> 4811.42]  your brother.
[4812.10 --> 4812.48]  Again,
[4812.68 --> 4814.08]  it's the opposite language
[4814.08 --> 4814.90]  because Jacob
[4814.90 --> 4815.62]  is told
[4815.62 --> 4816.38]  that his family
[4816.38 --> 4817.54]  will bow down to him
[4817.54 --> 4818.78]  and that he will prosper.
[4819.92 --> 4820.80]  Esau is told
[4820.80 --> 4821.60]  that he will be
[4821.60 --> 4822.38]  the one bowing.
[4823.56 --> 4824.26]  But Esau
[4824.26 --> 4825.36]  is also given
[4825.36 --> 4826.60]  a promise.
[4827.62 --> 4828.42]  But when you grow
[4828.42 --> 4828.96]  restless,
[4829.54 --> 4830.34]  you will throw
[4830.34 --> 4831.28]  his yoke
[4831.28 --> 4831.98]  from off
[4831.98 --> 4833.06]  your neck.
[4834.40 --> 4835.20]  And here,
[4835.44 --> 4835.80]  perhaps,
[4836.64 --> 4837.72]  is the only word
[4837.72 --> 4838.56]  of hope
[4838.56 --> 4839.68]  that Esau gets.
[4839.68 --> 4840.92]  that at some point
[4840.92 --> 4842.00]  in their history,
[4842.44 --> 4843.56]  Esau will no longer
[4843.56 --> 4845.14]  remain under the thumb
[4845.14 --> 4846.50]  of Jacob.
[4847.38 --> 4848.48]  And I'm going to suggest
[4848.48 --> 4849.90]  that this is a promise
[4849.90 --> 4851.38]  and a goodness of God
[4851.38 --> 4853.08]  revealed in his common grace
[4853.08 --> 4855.10]  even to Esau,
[4855.20 --> 4855.86]  a common grace
[4855.86 --> 4856.98]  that is available to him
[4856.98 --> 4858.38]  because if you read the story,
[4858.58 --> 4860.00]  that does eventually happen.
[4860.14 --> 4861.64]  Esau's line continues.
[4862.12 --> 4863.28]  He separates out
[4863.28 --> 4864.08]  from his brother.
[4864.28 --> 4865.60]  He moves into the land
[4865.60 --> 4866.54]  of Canaan
[4866.54 --> 4867.48]  where he grows
[4867.48 --> 4868.06]  and he grows
[4868.06 --> 4868.96]  and eventually
[4868.96 --> 4870.70]  we know him
[4870.70 --> 4871.44]  as the father
[4871.44 --> 4872.42]  of the Edomites,
[4873.08 --> 4874.16]  a people who live
[4874.16 --> 4874.90]  in the hill country
[4874.90 --> 4875.44]  of Seir.
[4875.52 --> 4876.38]  He's grown into
[4876.38 --> 4878.32]  his own great nation,
[4878.48 --> 4880.16]  but he's not
[4880.16 --> 4882.86]  the chosen nation.
[4885.06 --> 4885.96]  And so let me land
[4885.96 --> 4886.38]  the plane
[4886.38 --> 4887.96]  here with this.
[4890.00 --> 4891.72]  Isaac is a faith hero
[4891.72 --> 4894.88]  because he blesses Jacob.
[4896.04 --> 4896.86]  He didn't know
[4896.86 --> 4897.60]  what he was doing,
[4898.66 --> 4900.02]  but God used him.
[4901.64 --> 4903.58]  God chose Isaac
[4903.58 --> 4905.18]  and God chose Jacob
[4905.18 --> 4907.14]  and so he used them.
[4908.56 --> 4909.80]  The only qualification
[4909.80 --> 4910.90]  you need
[4910.90 --> 4912.52]  to be a faith hero
[4912.52 --> 4914.26]  is to be chosen by God.
[4915.06 --> 4916.10]  And if today,
[4916.24 --> 4917.56]  by grace through faith,
[4917.56 --> 4918.62]  you believe,
[4918.94 --> 4920.48]  you are chosen by God.
[4920.48 --> 4920.52]  God.
[4921.46 --> 4923.26]  And so you are,
[4923.40 --> 4924.46]  or at least you can be,
[4924.62 --> 4926.30]  someone's faith hero.
[4927.66 --> 4928.06]  You see,
[4928.22 --> 4929.52]  it's not about
[4929.52 --> 4931.30]  who you choose.
[4932.28 --> 4932.88]  It's about
[4932.88 --> 4933.76]  who has chosen you.
[4935.04 --> 4935.96]  And when God
[4935.96 --> 4937.10]  chooses you,
[4937.36 --> 4938.08]  he changes
[4938.08 --> 4939.16]  your family,
[4939.32 --> 4939.86]  he changes
[4939.86 --> 4940.70]  your life.
[4940.82 --> 4941.72]  And like Isaac,
[4942.16 --> 4943.24]  you may not have
[4943.24 --> 4944.18]  the eyes to see it
[4944.18 --> 4945.10]  in this moment.
[4946.00 --> 4947.24]  But God will work
[4947.24 --> 4947.80]  in you
[4947.80 --> 4948.64]  and through you
[4948.64 --> 4950.64]  to accomplish his purposes.
[4951.56 --> 4952.30]  And we know
[4952.30 --> 4953.36]  that that is true
[4953.36 --> 4954.96]  because if you take
[4954.96 --> 4955.58]  this story
[4955.58 --> 4956.90]  and just zoom forward
[4956.90 --> 4957.82]  throughout the rest
[4957.82 --> 4959.00]  of the Old Testament,
[4959.14 --> 4959.66]  throughout the rest
[4959.66 --> 4960.56]  of the drama of Scripture,
[4960.84 --> 4961.66]  it culminates
[4961.66 --> 4962.30]  in the coming
[4962.30 --> 4963.32]  of God himself
[4963.32 --> 4964.74]  in Jesus Christ.
[4965.20 --> 4965.96]  That the covenant
[4965.96 --> 4967.06]  promises of God
[4967.06 --> 4968.68]  spoken to Abraham
[4968.68 --> 4970.04]  are fulfilled
[4970.04 --> 4972.04]  in the person
[4972.04 --> 4973.60]  of Jesus Christ.
[4973.74 --> 4974.72]  The covenant promises
[4974.72 --> 4975.70]  of God
[4975.70 --> 4976.98]  spoken to Isaac
[4976.98 --> 4977.82]  anticipated
[4977.82 --> 4978.84]  in the ram
[4978.84 --> 4980.56]  substitute sacrifice
[4980.56 --> 4981.42]  are fulfilled
[4981.42 --> 4982.84]  in the sacrifice
[4982.84 --> 4984.04]  of Jesus.
[4984.26 --> 4985.04]  Jesus comes
[4985.04 --> 4986.14]  into the world
[4986.14 --> 4986.90]  as the fulfillment
[4986.90 --> 4988.60]  of God's covenant promises
[4988.60 --> 4989.32]  and he lives
[4989.32 --> 4989.82]  the life
[4989.82 --> 4990.78]  we should have lived.
[4990.90 --> 4991.58]  He knows
[4991.58 --> 4992.24]  the plans
[4992.24 --> 4993.42]  of the Father
[4993.42 --> 4994.38]  and he lives
[4994.38 --> 4995.54]  them perfectly
[4995.54 --> 4996.88]  and he still
[4996.88 --> 4998.02]  yet dies
[4998.02 --> 4998.82]  the death
[4998.82 --> 5000.34]  that we deserve.
[5000.34 --> 5003.70]  You may not see
[5003.70 --> 5005.28]  what God is doing
[5005.28 --> 5006.32]  or how he's going
[5006.32 --> 5007.22]  to accomplish it
[5007.22 --> 5009.20]  but the very fact
[5009.20 --> 5010.24]  of Jesus' life,
[5010.84 --> 5011.42]  his death
[5011.42 --> 5012.72]  and his resurrection
[5012.72 --> 5014.48]  is a promise
[5014.48 --> 5015.06]  for you,
[5015.32 --> 5015.90]  a guarantee
[5015.90 --> 5016.72]  for you
[5016.72 --> 5017.92]  that God does.
[5018.46 --> 5019.08]  He knows,
[5019.38 --> 5020.14]  he sees
[5020.14 --> 5021.06]  and he will call
[5021.06 --> 5022.16]  and he will carry.
[5024.66 --> 5025.16]  And so,
[5026.44 --> 5029.20]  hear the covenant
[5029.20 --> 5030.70]  promise of God
[5030.70 --> 5033.76]  and ask
[5033.76 --> 5034.94]  in spite
[5034.94 --> 5036.92]  of the unknown
[5036.92 --> 5038.68]  how can you
[5038.68 --> 5039.52]  be used of God?
[5040.32 --> 5041.42]  In spite of
[5041.42 --> 5042.72]  not understanding
[5042.72 --> 5043.62]  much of anything
[5043.62 --> 5045.64]  of God's ways
[5045.64 --> 5046.92]  how can we
[5046.92 --> 5047.70]  be used by him?
[5050.20 --> 5051.22]  I have a
[5051.22 --> 5052.66]  friend,
[5054.32 --> 5055.00]  she's become
[5055.00 --> 5055.50]  a friend
[5055.50 --> 5057.50]  who's a missionary
[5057.50 --> 5058.84]  in North Africa
[5058.84 --> 5060.74]  now I'm not
[5060.74 --> 5061.10]  going to use
[5061.10 --> 5061.64]  her name
[5061.64 --> 5063.62]  because
[5063.62 --> 5064.86]  where she serves
[5064.86 --> 5065.52]  it's illegal
[5065.52 --> 5066.28]  to be a Christian
[5066.28 --> 5066.64]  missionary
[5066.64 --> 5067.78]  and these
[5067.78 --> 5068.48]  services are
[5068.48 --> 5068.90]  recorded.
[5070.16 --> 5070.90]  She sends
[5070.90 --> 5071.30]  out
[5071.30 --> 5072.52]  quarterly
[5072.52 --> 5073.14]  updates
[5073.14 --> 5073.74]  and tells
[5073.74 --> 5074.04]  us
[5074.04 --> 5074.72]  please don't
[5074.72 --> 5075.12]  forward
[5075.12 --> 5075.90]  these updates
[5075.90 --> 5076.30]  to other
[5076.30 --> 5076.56]  people
[5076.56 --> 5076.98]  because they
[5076.98 --> 5077.32]  can't be
[5077.32 --> 5077.96]  circulated
[5077.96 --> 5078.66]  because if
[5078.66 --> 5078.88]  it gets
[5078.88 --> 5079.26]  back to
[5079.26 --> 5079.66]  the place
[5079.66 --> 5080.48]  where she's
[5080.48 --> 5080.84]  working
[5080.84 --> 5081.32]  she could
[5081.32 --> 5082.10]  be arrested
[5082.10 --> 5082.76]  and tried
[5082.76 --> 5083.14]  and
[5083.14 --> 5084.56]  God forbid
[5084.56 --> 5085.76]  even killed
[5085.76 --> 5086.40]  for being a
[5086.40 --> 5086.68]  missionary.
[5086.68 --> 5087.68]  missionary
[5087.68 --> 5088.14]  she's a
[5088.14 --> 5088.54]  missionary
[5088.54 --> 5089.82]  serving in
[5089.82 --> 5090.40]  North Africa
[5090.40 --> 5091.72]  and I get
[5091.72 --> 5092.26]  her updates
[5092.26 --> 5092.68]  and every
[5092.68 --> 5093.62]  time we
[5093.62 --> 5094.38]  read from
[5094.38 --> 5094.96]  her and
[5094.96 --> 5095.64]  and when
[5095.64 --> 5095.96]  we lived
[5095.96 --> 5096.58]  back east
[5096.58 --> 5097.76]  usually once
[5097.76 --> 5098.24]  a year or
[5098.24 --> 5098.62]  once every
[5098.62 --> 5099.02]  other year
[5099.02 --> 5099.34]  she would
[5099.34 --> 5100.06]  come and
[5100.06 --> 5100.48]  visit the
[5100.48 --> 5100.88]  church that
[5100.88 --> 5101.30]  we were at
[5101.30 --> 5102.62]  and she
[5102.62 --> 5103.08]  would talk
[5103.08 --> 5103.88]  about the
[5103.88 --> 5104.58]  people that
[5104.58 --> 5105.32]  she sees
[5105.32 --> 5105.90]  converted
[5105.90 --> 5107.42]  through the
[5107.42 --> 5108.44]  ministry of
[5108.44 --> 5109.46]  God in
[5109.46 --> 5109.70]  the work
[5109.70 --> 5110.06]  that she's
[5110.06 --> 5110.86]  doing and
[5110.86 --> 5111.14]  she would
[5111.14 --> 5111.68]  talk about
[5111.68 --> 5112.38]  those people
[5112.38 --> 5112.98]  as her
[5112.98 --> 5114.26]  brothers and
[5114.26 --> 5115.18]  sisters as
[5115.18 --> 5116.06]  her family
[5116.06 --> 5117.18]  in Christ
[5117.18 --> 5118.38]  Jesus and
[5118.38 --> 5119.74]  she shows
[5119.74 --> 5120.72]  to me at
[5120.72 --> 5121.24]  least that
[5121.24 --> 5122.38]  her willingness
[5122.38 --> 5123.32]  and she
[5123.32 --> 5124.28]  will express
[5124.28 --> 5125.82]  explicitly that
[5125.82 --> 5126.24]  she will
[5126.24 --> 5127.86]  always go
[5127.86 --> 5128.34]  to them.
[5130.06 --> 5130.94]  In fact
[5130.94 --> 5132.10]  during COVID
[5132.10 --> 5132.84]  there was a
[5132.84 --> 5133.56]  she was
[5133.56 --> 5135.68]  on homestay
[5135.68 --> 5137.10]  back here
[5137.10 --> 5137.68]  in North
[5137.68 --> 5138.08]  America
[5138.08 --> 5139.56]  and was
[5139.56 --> 5140.14]  unable to
[5140.14 --> 5142.00]  return and
[5142.00 --> 5142.72]  that lasted
[5142.72 --> 5143.40]  about eight
[5143.40 --> 5144.14]  months before
[5144.14 --> 5144.54]  she could
[5144.54 --> 5145.08]  finally get
[5145.08 --> 5145.74]  back and
[5145.74 --> 5146.44]  her heart
[5146.44 --> 5148.10]  broke every
[5148.10 --> 5148.68]  day for
[5148.68 --> 5149.18]  those people
[5149.18 --> 5149.56]  that she
[5149.56 --> 5150.00]  couldn't
[5150.00 --> 5151.20]  connect with.
[5151.46 --> 5152.06]  She will
[5152.06 --> 5152.92]  always go
[5152.92 --> 5153.34]  to them
[5153.34 --> 5154.36]  and she
[5154.36 --> 5155.90]  describes a
[5155.90 --> 5156.60]  love for
[5156.60 --> 5157.26]  them that
[5157.26 --> 5158.80]  is beyond
[5158.80 --> 5159.50]  measure, a
[5159.50 --> 5159.90]  love for
[5159.90 --> 5160.24]  them that
[5160.24 --> 5160.80]  can only
[5160.80 --> 5161.44]  come from
[5161.44 --> 5161.94]  the heart
[5161.94 --> 5162.62]  of the
[5162.62 --> 5163.60]  father and
[5163.60 --> 5164.38]  she says
[5164.38 --> 5164.78]  that she
[5164.78 --> 5165.34]  has this
[5165.34 --> 5165.96]  love for
[5165.96 --> 5166.92]  them because
[5166.92 --> 5168.00]  they share
[5168.00 --> 5169.20]  a father.
[5171.00 --> 5171.42]  See there's
[5171.42 --> 5173.12]  this compelling
[5173.12 --> 5175.32]  love that
[5175.32 --> 5176.76]  we know
[5176.76 --> 5177.90]  from being
[5177.90 --> 5179.54]  chosen by
[5179.54 --> 5180.60]  God.
[5181.72 --> 5182.86]  Jacob I
[5182.86 --> 5184.18]  have loved.
[5185.26 --> 5186.18]  If by grace
[5186.18 --> 5187.08]  through faith
[5187.08 --> 5188.20]  God says to
[5188.20 --> 5189.88]  you, I love
[5189.88 --> 5190.16]  you.
[5190.86 --> 5191.90]  You are my
[5191.90 --> 5193.08]  son and
[5193.08 --> 5193.78]  daughter and
[5193.78 --> 5195.28]  so now we
[5195.28 --> 5195.80]  go.
[5196.54 --> 5197.08]  We may not
[5197.08 --> 5197.72]  know how God
[5197.72 --> 5198.16]  is at work
[5198.16 --> 5199.04]  but he is and
[5199.04 --> 5200.22]  so like Isaac
[5200.22 --> 5202.20]  we go in
[5202.20 --> 5203.32]  response to
[5203.32 --> 5203.86]  the covenant
[5203.86 --> 5205.66]  promises of
[5205.66 --> 5205.98]  God.
[5208.02 --> 5209.00]  Now precisely
[5209.00 --> 5209.78]  because we
[5209.78 --> 5210.48]  don't know
[5210.48 --> 5211.96]  exactly the
[5211.96 --> 5212.38]  way God
[5212.38 --> 5212.78]  works,
[5213.64 --> 5214.10]  precisely
[5214.10 --> 5214.96]  because God's
[5214.96 --> 5215.98]  ways are not
[5215.98 --> 5216.72]  our ways,
[5217.06 --> 5217.68]  he gives us
[5217.68 --> 5219.44]  a family and
[5219.44 --> 5220.02]  as a family
[5220.02 --> 5220.56]  we have a
[5220.56 --> 5220.78]  meal.
[5221.94 --> 5222.70]  We come to
[5222.70 --> 5223.66]  this table so
[5223.66 --> 5224.62]  that God would
[5224.62 --> 5225.82]  nourish us for
[5225.82 --> 5227.44]  this journey of
[5227.44 --> 5227.96]  faith.
[5227.96 --> 5228.40]  faith.
[5228.40 --> 5229.56]  We come to
[5229.56 --> 5230.34]  this covenant
[5230.34 --> 5231.60]  meal so that
[5231.60 --> 5232.86]  by his grace
[5232.86 --> 5234.58]  we here can
[5234.58 --> 5236.64]  receive the
[5236.64 --> 5238.14]  sustenance we
[5238.14 --> 5239.70]  need to be
[5239.70 --> 5241.36]  sent on our
[5241.36 --> 5241.62]  way.
[5242.38 --> 5243.34]  We come to
[5243.34 --> 5243.94]  this table
[5243.94 --> 5246.32]  because this is
[5246.32 --> 5246.88]  where God
[5246.88 --> 5247.64]  meets us,
[5248.22 --> 5249.06]  fills us up,
[5249.42 --> 5250.26]  and sends us
[5250.26 --> 5251.44]  out in his
[5251.44 --> 5252.16]  promise.
[5252.78 --> 5253.94]  As we come to
[5253.94 --> 5254.60]  this table we
[5254.60 --> 5255.22]  have a liturgy
[5255.22 --> 5255.84]  will be on
[5255.84 --> 5256.38]  the screen
[5256.38 --> 5257.08]  overhead.
[5257.34 --> 5258.00]  I invite you
[5258.00 --> 5259.08]  to participate
[5259.08 --> 5260.34]  and to read
[5260.34 --> 5260.90]  the portions
[5260.90 --> 5261.44]  that are given
[5261.44 --> 5262.52]  there for you.
[5263.32 --> 5264.08]  Lift up your
[5264.08 --> 5264.44]  hearts.
[5265.30 --> 5266.14]  Lift up your
[5266.14 --> 5266.64]  hearts to the
[5266.64 --> 5266.90]  Lord.
[5267.42 --> 5268.06]  Let us give
[5268.06 --> 5268.76]  thanks to the
[5268.76 --> 5269.52]  Lord our God.
[5270.24 --> 5271.26]  It is right for
[5271.26 --> 5271.92]  us to give
[5271.92 --> 5272.38]  thanks.
[5272.90 --> 5273.32]  Let's pray
[5273.32 --> 5273.68]  together.
[5275.92 --> 5277.26]  With joy we
[5277.26 --> 5278.20]  praise you,
[5278.54 --> 5279.28]  gracious God.
[5279.92 --> 5280.48]  For you have
[5280.48 --> 5281.26]  created heaven
[5281.26 --> 5281.84]  and earth and
[5281.84 --> 5282.52]  have made us in
[5282.52 --> 5282.94]  your image.
[5283.28 --> 5283.70]  You have kept
[5283.70 --> 5284.92]  covenant with us,
[5284.92 --> 5286.02]  even when we
[5286.02 --> 5286.88]  fell into sin.
[5288.00 --> 5288.68]  We give you
[5288.68 --> 5289.46]  thanks for
[5289.46 --> 5290.24]  Jesus Christ,
[5290.58 --> 5291.24]  who by his
[5291.24 --> 5291.98]  life, death,
[5292.08 --> 5292.66]  and resurrection
[5292.66 --> 5293.72]  opened to us
[5293.72 --> 5295.00]  the way of
[5295.00 --> 5296.02]  life everlasting.
[5297.16 --> 5297.50]  Amen.
[5302.70 --> 5303.34]  Jesus,
[5303.98 --> 5305.12]  before he
[5305.12 --> 5305.74]  suffered,
[5306.02 --> 5306.72]  gave us
[5306.72 --> 5307.74]  this memorial
[5307.74 --> 5309.38]  of his
[5309.38 --> 5310.32]  sacrifice
[5310.32 --> 5311.12]  until he
[5311.12 --> 5311.68]  comes again.
[5312.68 --> 5313.22]  The Lord
[5313.22 --> 5313.54]  Jesus,
[5313.70 --> 5314.12]  on the night
[5314.12 --> 5314.50]  that he
[5314.50 --> 5315.08]  was
[5315.08 --> 5315.78]  betrayed,
[5316.86 --> 5317.94]  took bread.
[5319.20 --> 5319.66]  And when he
[5319.66 --> 5319.98]  had given
[5319.98 --> 5320.68]  thanks,
[5321.00 --> 5321.62]  he broke
[5321.62 --> 5322.16]  it and he
[5322.16 --> 5322.42]  said,
[5322.80 --> 5323.44]  this is
[5323.44 --> 5324.64]  my body
[5324.64 --> 5325.30]  which is
[5325.30 --> 5325.74]  for you.
[5326.38 --> 5327.06]  Do this
[5327.06 --> 5327.88]  in remembrance
[5327.88 --> 5328.92]  of me.
[5331.82 --> 5332.74]  In the same
[5332.74 --> 5333.10]  way,
[5333.24 --> 5333.80]  he took the
[5333.80 --> 5335.00]  cup after
[5335.00 --> 5335.68]  supper and
[5335.68 --> 5336.10]  he said,
[5336.48 --> 5337.04]  this cup
[5337.04 --> 5337.84]  is the new
[5337.84 --> 5338.60]  covenant in
[5338.60 --> 5339.28]  my blood.
[5339.80 --> 5340.46]  Do this
[5340.46 --> 5341.36]  whenever you
[5341.36 --> 5341.88]  drink it
[5341.88 --> 5342.80]  in remembrance
[5342.80 --> 5343.64]  of me.
[5346.76 --> 5347.36]  For
[5347.36 --> 5348.20]  whenever we
[5348.20 --> 5348.74]  eat this
[5348.74 --> 5349.42]  bread and
[5349.42 --> 5350.30]  drink this
[5350.30 --> 5351.10]  cup, we
[5351.10 --> 5351.98]  proclaim the
[5351.98 --> 5352.68]  Lord's death
[5352.68 --> 5354.10]  until he
[5354.10 --> 5355.54]  comes again.
[5357.34 --> 5358.72]  This is the
[5358.72 --> 5359.80]  mystery of
[5359.80 --> 5360.34]  our faith.
[5360.34 --> 5365.88]  your resurrection
[5365.88 --> 5366.76]  we affirm
[5366.76 --> 5367.36]  with joy.

[5368.82 --> 5369.50]  we await
[5369.50 --> 5370.10]  with hope.
[5370.90 --> 5371.54]  Glory be

[5380.84 --> 5381.78]  him alone
[5381.78 --> 5382.68]  for their
