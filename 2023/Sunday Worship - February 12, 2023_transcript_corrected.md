[0.00 → 12.68] Rise on eagles' wings before my God, fall on my knees and rise.
[15.74 → 18.36] I will rise.
[22.46 → 26.36] There's a day that's drawing near.
[26.36 → 38.20] When this darkness breaks to light and the shadows disappear.
[39.78 → 44.36] And my faith shall be my eyes.
[46.50 → 55.36] Jesus has overcome, and the grave is overwhelmed.
[56.36 → 62.70] The victory is won.
[63.50 → 67.84] He is risen from the dead.
[68.20 → 71.86] And I will rise.
[71.96 → 74.36] When He calls my name.
[75.56 → 78.10] No more sorrow.
[78.66 → 80.68] No more pain.
[80.68 → 82.68] I will rise.
[82.68 → 83.84] I will rise.
[83.84 → 86.76] On eagles' wings.
[87.02 → 89.72] Before my God.
[90.14 → 92.66] Fall on my knees.
[93.10 → 94.68] And rise.
[94.68 → 96.68] I will rise.
[96.68 → 101.68] I will rise.
[101.68 → 103.68] I will rise.
[103.68 → 105.68] I will rise.
[105.68 → 112.68] And I hear the voice of many angels sing.
[114.02 → 117.84] Worthy is the Lamb.
[117.84 → 127.84] Worthy is the Lamb.
[127.84 → 129.68] Worthy is the Lamb.
[129.68 → 130.68] Worthy is the Lamb.
[130.68 → 136.64] And I hear the voice of many angels sing.
[136.64 → 141.24] Worthy is the Lamb.
[141.24 → 147.68] And I hear the cry of every longing heart.
[147.68 → 148.68] You are worthy.
[148.68 → 149.68] You are worthy.

[239.68 → 246.68] What gift of grace is Jesus my Redeemer?
[246.68 → 253.68] There is no more for heaven now to give.
[254.68 → 258.68] He is my joy, my right.
[259.68 → 261.68] Good morning.
[262.68 → 265.68] Welcome to church.
[265.68 → 270.68] We are really excited to gather to worship our God together this morning.
[270.68 → 274.68] If you're visiting with us or if you're checking us out online for the first time,
[274.68 → 277.68] my name is Chris, and I'm one of the pastors here.
[277.68 → 281.68] And it's my privilege, along with these others on stage,
[281.68 → 285.68] to lead in our worship together this morning.
[285.68 → 288.68] As you can see from the table set before me,
[288.68 → 292.68] today we are coming together in the Lord's Supper.
[292.68 → 297.68] In communion, we gather around the table of our Lord to receive Jesus
[297.68 → 303.68] in tangible ways to taste and see that the Lord is good.
[303.68 → 305.68] And so as we worship together this morning,
[306.68 → 311.68] prepare your hearts and minds to come to this table together.
[311.68 → 314.68] I'll give some more instructions on what that looks like when we get there.
[315.68 → 318.68] Before we begin, there are a couple announcements that we would like to make.
[318.68 → 323.68] The first of which is that if you are a youth, a teenager here,
[323.68 → 329.68] 2020 that was originally scheduled for this evening has been moved to this afternoon
[329.68 → 332.68] because there's some sort of sports games or something going on today.
[332.68 → 338.68] And we wanted to make sure that those of you who were into that could attend and watch that.
[338.68 → 344.68] So after church, immediately, 2020 will be here, and it will come with lunch.
[344.68 → 346.68] And so there are buns and the like.
[346.68 → 351.68] And so if you prepared buns for that, I hope that those are in the kitchen there,
[351.68 → 353.68] ready to go for that time.
[353.68 → 365.68] As well, we are going to be hosting, running a course or a program called Christianity Explored in the near future.
[365.68 → 370.68] And if that's something you're interested in, and that's really for people who are new to the Christian faith
[370.68 → 376.68] or who are returning to the Christian faith, maybe after a few years or many years away,
[376.68 → 380.68] just to dig into what does it mean to be Christian?
[380.68 → 382.68] What do we believe?
[382.68 → 385.68] And so if that's something you're interested in, you can grab me.
[385.68 → 390.68] I'll be at the Connect table after service and I can sign you up for that
[390.68 → 393.68] or answer any questions you have, and we can get prepared for that.
[393.68 → 399.68] As well, in February, we have a team that's participating in the coldest night of the year,
[399.68 → 404.68] which is put on by the Salvation Army run here in Langley through the Gateway of Hope,
[404.68 → 406.68] where a number of us get together.
[406.68 → 411.68] We walk for five kilometres, and we raise funds to support homelessness
[411.68 → 416.68] or those who are struggling with homelessness and to provide means and care for them.
[416.68 → 422.68] Our team can use some rounding out, and so we need some more people to sign up.
[422.68 → 427.68] If you are interested in joining with that, you can go online, the coldest night of the year,
[427.68 → 434.68] and see those details, or you can grab Nikki right here, and she will fill that in for you.
[434.68 → 437.68] And then Josh, you had something, right?
[437.68 → 443.68] Okay, so I have two announcements.
[443.68 → 447.68] The first one is the Young Adults Bible Studies today at my place.
[447.68 → 449.68] Lunch is provided.
[449.68 → 453.68] Then the second announcement is the care packages are happening again.
[453.68 → 454.68] It's that time of year.
[454.68 → 463.68] So there are five to six young adults that are away at college or living abroad that are still a part of this church
[463.68 → 466.68] and we'd like to keep them anchored to this community.
[466.68 → 472.68] Because a lot of studies show that when they lose that anchor to a faith community that they're from,
[472.68 → 476.68] that it has negative effects on how they live life and their connection to God.
[476.68 → 485.68] So we need five to six families or people to volunteer to help make those care packages like we've done the previous years.
[485.68 → 496.68] They're about the size of a shoebox and then the contents would be like candy, food, socks, to stuff that students would need,
[496.68 → 501.68] a letter saying hi to them and asking them how they're doing.
[501.68 → 503.68] You'll get a letter back from them.
[503.68 → 508.68] And then we need it back.
[508.68 → 512.68] So you're going to, if you want to volunteer and do this, you're going to need to contact me
[512.68 → 516.68] and then I'll give you the name of the young adult that you will buy for.
[516.68 → 521.68] And then you just need to bring the supplies to the church and that we're mailing them out.
[521.68 → 525.68] So you don't have to mail them out or deal with all that stress with post-Canada.
[525.68 → 535.68] And yeah, we want to get them by the next Sunday.
[535.68 → 537.68] Thank you.
[537.68 → 543.68] If you have any questions about what that is, Josh will also be around after service before he runs to his house to lead the Bible study.
[543.68 → 544.68] Right, Josh?
[544.68 → 545.68] Very good.
[545.68 → 546.68] Okay.
[546.68 → 548.68] I believe that, oh, one more announcement.
[548.68 → 549.68] Sorry.
[549.68 → 554.68] March 7th and 8th, we, our church is hosting classes.
[554.68 → 562.68] Classes is the regional group of Christian Reformed churches here in the valley and, well, I guess on this side of the Fraser River.
[562.68 → 569.68] We're hosting that meeting here and that comes with a need to host and provide meals and refreshments and the like.
[569.68 → 571.68] And so, Dolores is taking care of that.
[571.68 → 575.68] There's a signup sheet on the round table in the foyer.
[575.68 → 582.68] If you are able to help or volunteer in that, please connect with Dolores or look at that signup sheet there.
[582.68 → 584.68] I think that's it.
[584.68 → 588.68] If I forgot something, you can probably find it in the e-bulletin.
[588.68 → 595.68] I'm going to invite you to stand as we begin our worship with God's greeting together.
[600.68 → 606.68] Following God's greeting, I'm going to invite you to turn to those with whom you are worshipping this morning and welcome them.
[606.68 → 611.68] You can do that in a really traditional way by saying the peace of Christ be with you.
[611.68 → 618.68] Or you can do that with a fist bump or a handshake and the like and welcoming them into worship.
[618.68 → 621.68] Receive the greeting of our God.
[622.68 → 634.68] Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, His Son, and our Saviour, through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[634.68 → 637.68] All God's people said, Amen.
[637.68 → 639.68] Would you turn to welcome those around here?
[641.68 → 642.68] Have you?
[642.68 → 643.68] Are you sure we were?
[643.68 → 644.68] Father's helping progress in his experience.
[644.68 → 648.68] Are you sure these are as positive as right and when it comes to Paris and in 있어?
[649.68 → 653.68] Thanks, have you.
[653.68 → 657.68] Rinse and balance is the tension.
[657.68 → 659.68] Let us tell Theron to you.
[660.68 → 663.68] Maybe you're willing.
[663.68 → 669.68] I'm sure he looks while you another shepherd.
[669.68 → 678.66] Our call to worship comes from Philippians.
[679.94 → 682.70] We gather this morning for communal worship.
[683.38 → 685.04] As brothers and sisters in Christ,
[685.42 → 687.76] join together as one in the name of Jesus.
[688.58 → 691.40] For God exalted him to the highest place
[691.40 → 696.06] and gave him the name that is above every name.
[697.06 → 700.76] That at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow
[700.76 → 703.18] in heaven and on earth and under the earth.
[703.78 → 706.92] And every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[706.92 → 709.24] To the glory of God the Father.
[726.06 → 733.06] We want to see Jesus lifted high,
[733.30 → 736.72] a banner that flies across this land.
[737.06 → 740.34] That all men might see the truth and know
[740.34 → 743.18] he is the way to heaven.
[744.26 → 747.90] We want to see Jesus lifted high,
[747.90 → 751.52] a banner that flies across this land.
[751.52 → 755.24] That all men might see the truth and know
[755.24 → 758.30] he is the way to heaven.
[759.14 → 762.28] We want to see, we want to see,
[762.40 → 766.28] we want to see Jesus lifted high.
[766.52 → 769.70] We want to see, we want to see,
[769.70 → 774.32] we want to see Jesus lifted high.
[774.32 → 784.98] We want to see Jesus lifted high,
[784.98 → 788.64] a banner that flies across this land.
[789.10 → 792.36] That all men might see the truth and know
[792.36 → 795.22] he is the way to heaven.
[795.22 → 800.00] We want to see, we want to see,
[800.00 → 802.00] we want to see Jesus lifted high.
[802.00 → 818.00] We want to see, we want to see Jesus lifted high.
[818.00 → 825.62] We want to see, we want to see Jesus lifted high.
[825.62 → 829.46] Step by step we're moving forward,
[829.88 → 833.00] little by little we're taking ground.
[833.54 → 836.80] Every prayer a powerful weapon,
[837.28 → 840.38] strongholds come and tumbling down,
[840.60 → 843.32] and down, and down, and down.
[843.32 → 848.90] We want to see, we want to see,
[848.90 → 851.46] we want to see Jesus lifted high.
[851.66 → 854.62] We want to see, we want to see,
[854.62 → 859.26] we want to see Jesus lifted high.

[916.50 → 919.42] All is stripped away
[919.42 → 924.82] And I simply come
[924.82 → 930.26] Longing just to bring
[930.26 → 933.38] Something that's of worth
[933.38 → 938.72] Love will bless your heart
[938.72 → 943.76] I'll bring you more than a song
[943.76 → 946.48] For a song in itself
[946.48 → 950.54] Is not what you have required
[950.54 → 956.60] You search much deeper within
[956.60 → 959.68] Through the way things appear
[959.68 → 966.46] You're looking into my heart
[966.46 → 972.88] I'm coming back to the heart of worship
[972.88 → 976.40] And it's all about you
[976.40 → 980.60] It's all about you, Jesus
[980.60 → 986.88] I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it
[986.88 → 990.38] When it's all about you
[990.38 → 994.38] It's all about you, Jesus
[994.38 → 1005.98] King of endless worth
[1005.98 → 1008.90] No one could express
[1008.90 → 1012.10] How much you deserve
[1012.10 → 1018.76] Though I'm weak and poor
[1018.76 → 1022.68] All I have is yours
[1022.68 → 1025.54] Every single breath
[1025.54 → 1032.40] I'll bring you more than a song
[1032.40 → 1035.32] For a song in itself
[1035.32 → 1038.54] Is not what you have required
[1038.54 → 1045.32] You search much deeper within
[1045.32 → 1048.76] Through the way things appear
[1048.76 → 1053.32] You're looking into my heart
[1053.32 → 1061.10] I'm coming back to the heart of worship
[1061.10 → 1064.10] And it's all about you
[1064.10 → 1068.04] All about you, Jesus
[1068.04 → 1074.86] I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it

[1078.04 → 1081.96] It's all about you, Jesus
[1081.96 → 1087.82] I'm coming back to the heart of worship
[1087.82 → 1090.82] When it's all about you
[1090.82 → 1095.28] It's all about you, Jesus
[1095.28 → 1101.52] I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it
[1101.52 → 1104.78] When it's all about you
[1104.78 → 1108.94] All about you, Jesus
[1108.94 → 1116.46] Pray with me
[1116.46 → 1121.86] Search us as we come before you in worship
[1121.86 → 1124.26] Search our hearts
[1124.26 → 1127.78] What posture do we come before you, O God?
[1128.50 → 1131.82] When the music fades, and we are faced with silence
[1131.82 → 1135.58] Do we sit in discomfort
[1135.58 → 1137.84] And wait for the next song to start?
[1139.76 → 1142.36] Do we make worship all about us
[1142.36 → 1144.42] And our rituals and our talents?
[1146.30 → 1150.20] Do we humbly offer our every breath in worship to you?
[1152.26 → 1155.20] Reveal the parts of us we hide away
[1155.20 → 1158.64] As your people who come to hear your word
[1158.64 → 1161.10] Sometimes our ears are deaf
[1161.10 → 1164.94] Because the eyes of our heart are not on you
[1164.94 → 1167.56] Create in us clean hearts
[1167.56 → 1170.44] And restore to us the joy of thy salvation
[1170.44 → 1174.20] That we may not fool ourselves in our worship
[1174.20 → 1176.34] But truly worship you
[1176.34 → 1178.52] It is the perfect worship
[1178.52 → 1181.96] That can only come through Christ Jesus, our Lord
[1181.96 → 1206.62] Create in me a clean heart
[1206.62 → 1208.62] Oh God
[1208.62 → 1215.92] And renew a right spirit within me
[1215.92 → 1221.62] Create in me a clean heart
[1221.62 → 1224.62] Oh God
[1224.62 → 1231.62] And renew a right spirit within me
[1231.62 → 1235.96] Cast me not away
[1235.96 → 1236.42] Cast me not away
[1236.42 → 1240.46] From thy presence, O Lord
[1240.46 → 1246.96] And take not thy Holy Spirit from me
[1246.96 → 1252.00] Restore unto me
[1252.00 → 1255.36] The joy of thy salvation
[1255.36 → 1261.82] And renew a right spirit within me
[1261.82 → 1268.20] Create in me a clean heart
[1268.20 → 1270.70] Oh God
[1270.70 → 1277.70] And renew a right spirit within me
[1277.70 → 1279.04] Create in me
[1279.04 → 1284.16] Create in me a clean heart
[1284.16 → 1286.04] Oh God
[1286.04 → 1290.04] And renew a right spirit within me
[1290.04 → 1292.04] Create in me
[1292.04 → 1294.04] Create in me a clean heart, O God
[1294.04 → 1295.04] And renew a right spirit within me
[1295.04 → 1297.04] Cast me not away
[1297.04 → 1301.38] From thy presence, O Lord
[1301.38 → 1303.38] And take not thy Holy Spirit from me
[1303.38 → 1305.38] And take not thy Holy Spirit from me
[1305.38 → 1310.38] Restore unto me
[1310.38 → 1311.38] Restore unto me
[1311.38 → 1315.38] The joy of thy salvation
[1315.38 → 1318.38] And renew a right spirit within me
[1318.38 → 1319.38] Restore unto me
[1319.38 → 1320.38] The joy of thy salvation
[1320.38 → 1322.38] And renew a right spirit within me
[1322.38 → 1326.38] Cast me not away
[1326.38 → 1330.72] From thy presence, O Lord
[1330.72 → 1334.72] And take not thy Holy Spirit from me
[1334.72 → 1339.72] Restore unto me
[1339.72 → 1341.72] Restore unto me
[1341.72 → 1344.72] The joy of thy salvation
[1344.72 → 1350.72] And renew a right spirit within me
[1350.72 → 1352.72] Restore unto me
[1352.72 → 1355.80] Subtitle unto me
[1355.80 → 1370.06] Subtitle unto me
[1370.06 → 1371.06] The joy of thy salvation
[1371.06 → 1371.08] And nominal
[1371.08 → 1372.20] Lord
[1372.20 → 1373.98] Most years
[1373.98 → 1376.10] Abquality
[1376.10 → 1402.42] I need thee every hour, most gracious Lord.
[1402.42 → 1411.96] No tender voice like thine can peace afford.
[1412.64 → 1421.88] I need thee, oh, I need thee every hour, I need thee.
[1421.88 → 1432.32] Oh, bless me now, my Saviour, I come to thee.
[1432.42 → 1442.36] I need thee every hour, stay thou nearby.
[1442.36 → 1452.30] Temptations lose their power when thou art not.
[1452.30 → 1461.74] I need thee, oh, I need thee every hour, I need thee.
[1461.74 → 1470.74] Oh, bless me now, my Saviour, I come to thee.
[1470.74 → 1482.48] I need thee every hour, enjoy your pain.
[1482.48 → 1491.78] Come quickly and abide, for life is vain.
[1491.78 → 1501.32] I need thee, oh, I need thee every hour, I need thee.
[1501.32 → 1511.26] Oh, bless me now, my Saviour, I come to thee.
[1511.26 → 1522.20] I need thee every hour, most holy one.
[1522.20 → 1527.20] Oh, make me thine indeed.
[1527.20 → 1537.20] Oh, bless me now, my Saviour, I come to thee.
[1537.20 → 1538.20] Every hour, I need thee.
[1538.20 → 1539.20] Every hour, I need thee.
[1539.20 → 1540.20] Every hour, I need thee.
[1540.20 → 1553.20] Oh, bless me now, my Saviour, I come to thee.
[1553.20 → 1554.20] I invite you to be seated.
[1554.20 → 1584.18] Good morning.
[1584.18 → 1586.18] Can you hear me?
[1586.18 → 1588.18] Oh, yeah, there we go.
[1588.18 → 1592.04] Good morning, I'm Clem, I'm a deacon here at Emmanuel.
[1592.04 → 1597.52] We continue our worship with the giving of our gifts to the budget, which covers the administration
[1597.52 → 1600.64] of the church and its ministries.
[1600.64 → 1608.32] And the special offering is Adult and Teen Challenge, a ministry that strives to help men
[1608.32 → 1612.32] and women recover from substance abuse problems.
[1612.32 → 1620.32] Holds strictly to the philosophy that the individual must desperately and sincerely desire to change.
[1620.32 → 1640.32] The ministry prepares students to reenter society as productive and valued citizens, followers of Jesus Christ, faithful husbands, wives, dedicated fathers, mothers, outstanding employees, healthy and balanced individuals, completely free of addiction.
[1640.32 → 1652.32] The mentoring and guidance is not psychologically or therapeutic in nature, but follows biblical counselling and perspective and application.
[1652.32 → 1664.32] It is not a drug rehabilitation program, but a Christian discipleship program specifically structured towards those with life controlling problems.
[1664.32 → 1669.32] God is at the centre of all that we envision, pursue and accomplish.
[1669.32 → 1681.32] We prayerfully seek His will and trust that He is guiding us every step of the way in providing excellence of care for the men and women we are entrusted to serve.
[1681.32 → 1687.98] Through His truth, love, and grace, we boldly walk as servant leaders in His great commission.
[1689.28 → 1700.94] The ministry of Adult and Teen Challenge is based entirely upon the belief that a relationship with God through Jesus Christ is the only way to find permanent and lasting freedom.
[1702.38 → 1705.10] 1 John 3, 16-18
[1705.10 → 1707.90] This is how we know what love is.
[1708.16 → 1711.12] Jesus Christ laid down His life for ours.
[1711.32 → 1712.38] 1 John 3, 17-19
[1712.38 → 1715.56] And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters.
[1716.14 → 1716.44] 2 John 3, 16-18
[1716.44 → 1727.10] If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity on them, how can the love of God be in that person?
[1727.64 → 1729.38] 2 John 4, 17-19
[1729.38 → 1733.98] Let us not love with words or speech, but with actions and in truth.
[1733.98 → 1734.22] 2 John 4, 17
[1734.22 → 1735.22] Amen.
[1735.22 → 1737.22] 2 John 5, 17
[1737.22 → 1766.72] If you but trust in God
[1766.72 → 1768.22] to guide you
[1768.22 → 1772.94] and place your confidence in Him
[1772.94 → 1778.02] You'll find Him always there beside you
[1778.02 → 1782.72] to give you hope and strength within
[1782.72 → 1787.68] For those who trust God's changeless love
[1787.68 → 1793.22] Build on the rock that will not move
[1793.22 → 1801.08] Only be still and wait His pleasure
[1801.08 → 1805.54] In cheerful hope with heart content
[1805.54 → 1810.72] He fills your needs to the fullest measure
[1810.72 → 1815.58] With what discerning love has sent
[1815.58 → 1820.28] Doubt not our inmost ones are known
[1820.28 → 1825.72] To Him who chose us for His own
[1825.72 → 1833.78] Sing, pray, and keep His ways unswerving
[1833.78 → 1837.92] Offer your service faithfully
[1837.92 → 1842.94] And trust His word, the one deserving
[1842.94 → 1847.80] You'll find His promise true to be
[1847.80 → 1852.70] God will never forsake in need
[1852.70 → 1857.30] The soul that trusts in Him indeed
[1857.30 → 1865.56] You'll find full threat your faithfully
[1865.56 → 1871.08] O cold but freedom by faithfully
[1871.08 → 1897.04] Thank you.
[1901.08 → 1917.08] My name is Mr. Starboard, and I'd like to invite all the three-year-olds to grade four up here.
[1917.08 → 1924.08] I'm a little confused why you're laughing so much.
[1924.08 → 1931.08] Nice to meet you guys. I said my name was Mr. Starboard. How are you?
[1931.08 → 1934.08] What? What? What?
[1934.08 → 1942.08] I can't fool you guys. Did you guys know it was me?
[1942.08 → 1943.08] Yeah.
[1943.08 → 1949.08] Oh, man. I thought for sure. Although not anybody else brought their horned helmet to church.
[1949.08 → 1954.08] I should have figured that one out first. It's easy. Is it easy?
[1954.08 → 1961.08] Oh, well, thank you for that segue. Did you? Oh, my. Oh, the glasses.
[1961.08 → 1973.08] Oh, the glasses. Oh, the glasses. I thought maybe you. Oh, oh, oh. I thought maybe the braces. I didn't. Vikings didn't really have braces or wear fancy things like this.
[1973.08 → 1985.08] You know what? We are going to switch gears in children's worship time. We've been talking about Jesus' early life, and we're going to switch over and start talking about King David a little bit. I know.
[1985.08 → 2009.08] I know. But, yes. But this whole get up, even though I tried my hardest to fool you guys. Well, maybe not my hardest. To fool you guys that I wasn't Mr. Mike. I was. And you guys saw right through it. And guess what? Guess who always sees right through whatever pretending or masks we have? Exactly. God and Jesus.
[2009.08 → 2028.36] And he desperately wants us to always see everybody for who they truly are because who they truly are children of his, no matter what. No matter you're short, tall, you've got crazy hair, you've got no hair, whatever it is, he loves you because he's your father, and you are one of his children.
[2028.36 → 2039.06] So we're going to talk about that some more in children's worship time today, okay? Sound good? I didn't bring a lot of dress-up clothes, though, so we'll probably just keep it chill because we also have Lord's Supper today.
[2039.08 → 2051.16] Oh, maybe I would have got you then. Okay, let's stand and do the children's blessing. And we'll head off to children's worship time. If the congregation can stand with us. Ready?
[2051.16 → 2054.16] The Lord be with you.
[2069.08 → 2094.30] Good morning. My name is Glenn. I'm one of the elders here at Emanuel Church. It's my privilege to lead you in our congregational prayer this morning.
[2094.30 → 2112.58] Before we do, we have one update on Carl Laws. As you read in the bulletin, he's been suffering from a broken rib. But they've also discovered that he has a pulmonary embolism, two blockages that are being treated. So we want to keep him in our prayers.
[2116.46 → 2117.56] Let's go to God in prayer.
[2117.56 → 2138.32] God is our refuge and our strength and ever-present help in trouble. Therefore, we will not fear, though the earth gives way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging.
[2138.32 → 2168.30] There is a river, though, and the mountains quake with their surging.
[2168.30 → 2172.12] We will be blessed and confidence in you as the psalmist who wrote these words.
[2173.10 → 2184.32] We thank you for the gift of Jesus, whose life, death, and resurrection made us right with you so that we can approach your throne with boldness to present our prayers and petitions.
[2186.20 → 2188.18] Bless our time of communion this morning.
[2188.18 → 2198.08] As we eat, drink, remember, and believe, Christ's body and blood were sacrificed for our sin and our guilt.
[2198.08 → 2205.12] This morning, we lift all those who are dealing with health concerns.
[2206.12 → 2209.90] Be with CY and Greta Kisser as CY receives treatment for cancer.
[2211.20 → 2216.86] We ask that the treatment will be effective and that you will sustain CY through the treatment process.
[2216.86 → 2221.62] We continue to pray for Jackie Birken pass, who is in the hospital.
[2222.62 → 2229.42] We ask that you strengthen her and provide the doctor's wisdom to decide the best course of treatment for her.
[2231.10 → 2237.96] Also be with Carl Loss, who is recovering from both a broken rib and a pulmonary embolism.
[2237.96 → 2245.16] Enable him to cope with the pain that he is experiencing and grant him a full and complete recovery.
[2247.46 → 2252.10] We pray for Eva Koch man, Dennis' mom, who broke her hip this week.
[2252.92 → 2258.02] Thank you for successful surgery, and we ask that you grant her full recovery from her injury.
[2258.88 → 2261.66] Be near to her as she goes through the healing process.
[2261.66 → 2268.30] We also ask that you be with Dave Hubert, who burned his hand quite badly this week.
[2269.02 → 2274.26] Give him full and complete healing and ease any pain that he may be experiencing.
[2277.60 → 2283.44] Be with Leanne Harris' father, who discovered that his cancer is inoperable.
[2284.58 → 2285.34] Be near to him.
[2286.56 → 2287.44] Walk beside him.
[2287.90 → 2288.44] Comfort him.
[2289.28 → 2290.72] And grant him your peace.
[2291.66 → 2298.16] Bless the grim and heightened families who will have a memorial service for Helen Hanson this week.
[2299.22 → 2302.84] Grant all the family members your comfort and peace as they grieve.
[2304.46 → 2307.48] Bless all who are struggling with illness and with chronic pain.
[2308.70 → 2311.44] Bless our aging family members who are dealing with these things.
[2312.48 → 2316.56] Grant them your comfort and strength to cope if healing is not your will.
[2316.56 → 2328.48] Father, we also pray for your comfort and blessing for all those who lost loved ones in Turkey and Syria due to a devastating earthquake about a week ago.
[2329.92 → 2330.54] Comfort them.
[2331.28 → 2333.22] Grant them your peace as they grieve.
[2334.58 → 2339.70] Bless all the organizations engaged in providing disaster relief to those affected.
[2339.70 → 2345.26] And bless these organizations who will be involved with cleanup and rebuilding.
[2346.20 → 2351.80] And provide all the necessary resources to support those affected by this devastating event.
[2351.80 → 2361.98] We pray for people in so many areas of the world who suffer the effects of war and armed conflicts.
[2362.98 → 2364.34] Comfort the victims of war.
[2365.12 → 2368.92] Cause the leaders of groups who perpetrate war to change their hearts.
[2369.98 → 2372.74] Help them become agents of peace rather than war.
[2372.74 → 2378.26] And we ask that you grant wisdom to the leaders in Europe and in North America.
[2378.90 → 2382.68] As they consider their roles in helping end the war in Ukraine.
[2384.94 → 2387.80] Father, we thank you for this church community at Langley Emanuel.
[2388.52 → 2391.60] We thank you for our pastors, leaders, and volunteers.
[2392.28 → 2394.58] And for the many ways that they serve this community.
[2395.96 → 2402.38] Enable us as a church to be body, or church body, to be salt and light in the community of Langley.
[2403.60 → 2407.78] We thank you that Jackie Hubert and Robin Baumann could attend the worship symposium this week.
[2408.66 → 2411.56] And we ask that you bless the worship committee with wisdom.
[2411.94 → 2413.84] As they lead us in praise and worship.
[2416.14 → 2417.76] And now as we turn to your word.
[2418.06 → 2419.90] We ask that you bless Pastor Chris.
[2420.12 → 2422.16] As he brings us the truth of your word.
[2423.16 → 2426.80] Enable him to speak with clarity and with boldness.
[2427.68 → 2428.92] Give us ears to hear.
[2429.68 → 2432.66] And hearts which are eager to follow your leading in obedience.
[2432.74 → 2436.44] And as we go from this place into a new week.
[2437.18 → 2440.96] Equip us to love you with all of our hearts, souls, and minds.
[2441.64 → 2444.68] And to love our neighbours as ourselves.
[2445.50 → 2445.80] Amen.
[2446.62 → 2447.10] Amen.
[2447.10 → 2447.46] Amen.
[2447.46 → 2447.50] Amen.
[2447.50 → 2447.76] Amen.
[2448.04 → 2448.50] Amen.
[2448.66 → 2449.06] Amen.
[2449.36 → 2452.58] Amen.
[2453.36 → 2454.28] Amen.
[2455.32 → 2458.38] Amen.
[2458.38 → 2482.86] Before we open God's Word, which we're going to do in Romans 2, I did realize I forgot
[2482.86 → 2491.94] an announcement at the beginning. And so in a week and a half, we are going to, as a church,
[2492.10 → 2502.46] enter into the season of Lent. Lent is the season which precedes Good Friday and Easter.
[2502.82 → 2511.18] And Lent begins on Ash Wednesday. And so there's going to be an Ash Wednesday service for you that
[2511.18 → 2517.32] will come with the imposition of ashes. And so that will come with the marking of ash on your
[2517.32 → 2522.80] forehead if you choose to participate in that way. You don't have to if that's not something you
[2522.80 → 2527.86] are familiar with or comfortable with. But we do want to invite you to that service on Ash Wednesday,
[2528.02 → 2535.04] which is February 22nd. That's a Wednesday. It will happen at 7 o'clock in the morning.
[2535.04 → 2545.16] It's 7 in the morning. So we can begin that series in Lent and spend the day marked with ashes or
[2545.16 → 2552.76] spend the day reflecting on what is to come. And so February 22nd, 7 o'clock in the morning here,
[2553.02 → 2558.86] we will have a special and short service for Ash Wednesday.
[2558.86 → 2570.28] With that, we are going to return in our series in the book of Romans to Romans 2. I invite you,
[2570.36 → 2577.10] if you have a Bible, to open that up. We're going to spend some time in verse 17 through 29,
[2577.46 → 2581.64] through the end of the chapter. And our first read-through will be on the screen behind me,
[2581.68 → 2588.10] so you can follow along there. But as always, I, of course, encourage you to have that in your hands
[2588.10 → 2598.36] as we go through together. This is the word of God in Romans 2, starting at verse 17.
[2602.10 → 2611.36] Now, you, if you call yourself a Jew, if you rely on the law and boast in God, if you know his will
[2611.36 → 2618.92] and approve of what is superior because you are instructed by the law, if you are convinced that
[2618.92 → 2624.52] you are a guide for the blind, a light for those who are in the dark, an instructor of the foolish,
[2624.68 → 2630.26] a teacher of little children, because you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth,
[2630.84 → 2637.70] you then, who teach others, do you not teach yourself?
[2637.70 → 2642.32] You who preach against stealing, do you steal?
[2643.34 → 2648.46] You who say that people should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery?
[2649.26 → 2653.28] You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?
[2654.56 → 2659.52] You who boast in the law, do you dishonour God by breaking the law?
[2660.58 → 2663.70] As it is written, God's name is being blasphemed
[2663.70 → 2666.98] blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.
[2669.18 → 2675.00] Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the law, you have become as though
[2675.00 → 2676.84] you had not been circumcised.
[2677.80 → 2683.72] So then, if those who are not circumcised keep the law's requirements, will they not be regarded
[2683.72 → 2685.64] as though they were circumcised?
[2685.64 → 2691.66] The one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who,
[2691.88 → 2697.08] even though you have the written code and circumcision, are a lawbreaker.
[2698.08 → 2706.00] A person is not a Jew who is one only outwardly, nor is circumcision merely outward and physical.
[2706.00 → 2713.94] No, a person is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is circumcision of the heart,
[2714.24 → 2717.48] by the spirit, not by the written code.
[2718.32 → 2722.96] Such a person's praise is not from other people, but from God.
[2723.72 → 2724.98] This is the word of the Lord.
[2724.98 → 2739.14] One of the first songs that we sang this morning has in the first pre-chorus the line,
[2739.44 → 2745.86] I'll bring you more than a song, for a song in itself is not what you have required.
[2746.72 → 2750.76] You search much deeper within through the way things appear.
[2750.76 → 2753.88] You are looking into my heart.
[2754.98 → 2758.70] This morning, we're going to dig into what that means,
[2760.02 → 2763.60] and what Paul says here in Romans 17.
[2764.20 → 2770.84] And what I am confident we will see, and that you might see for yourself,
[2771.54 → 2777.76] is that when you look into your heart of faith, it might be dead.
[2777.76 → 2785.40] There's a lot to get through this morning, and so let's jump right in.
[2787.00 → 2792.72] In these first few verses that we read, Paul is challenging his audience,
[2792.98 → 2795.92] and he's challenging their presumption.
[2796.72 → 2801.02] Their presumption of place and their presumption of life.
[2801.02 → 2809.50] And it's easy for us to not hear the force of it, or to not hear how potentially offensive it is,
[2809.56 → 2814.12] because, as far as I am aware, none of us here are Jewish.
[2815.74 → 2816.18] Right?
[2816.24 → 2822.96] And so when we read a text like this one, it's easy to sort of other the text.
[2822.96 → 2824.04] Right?
[2824.08 → 2826.00] It's easy to say this is about someone else.
[2826.08 → 2827.90] This is for someone else.
[2828.06 → 2829.88] It applies to someone else.
[2830.68 → 2838.38] But Paul's purpose in this text is to actually challenge the bothering that's been happening already,
[2838.52 → 2845.04] that's been happening as the first hearers of this have gone through.
[2845.04 → 2856.74] The people that Paul is writing to are likely Jewish, Bible-believing converts to Christianity living in Rome.
[2857.96 → 2865.08] If you know anything about history at this time, right, Rome is the centre of the empire,
[2865.36 → 2868.50] and from the perspective of the Romans, it's the centre of the world.
[2868.50 → 2875.62] And so think about the privilege and the presumption that would result for that.
[2876.02 → 2876.12] Right?
[2876.24 → 2882.50] And not just socially, but religiously, because here you have a Jew living in Rome.
[2882.68 → 2882.84] Right?
[2882.90 → 2886.40] I am religiously one of the chosen of God.
[2887.34 → 2888.92] I have the law.
[2889.14 → 2890.32] I have the word.
[2890.82 → 2892.54] I know the truth.
[2892.54 → 2901.92] And, to top it off, I live in the centre of political power, the best place to live in the world.
[2903.26 → 2908.54] And what Paul is doing as they listen to this text is he pulls them in close.
[2909.26 → 2912.80] It's kind of like he's, the image I have is him like gathering people up.
[2912.92 → 2916.40] He's saying, okay, come, listen to what I'm saying.
[2916.50 → 2916.72] Listen.
[2916.82 → 2917.96] He's drawing them in.
[2918.02 → 2920.50] That's what he's doing in verse 17 through 20.
[2920.50 → 2923.86] He says, if you call yourself a Jew, come close.
[2924.50 → 2925.18] Gather round.
[2925.38 → 2927.38] Listen to what I have to say.
[2927.54 → 2931.58] If you rely on the law, and you boast in God, come on here.
[2932.60 → 2934.18] Come on close.
[2934.32 → 2935.94] Hear what I will tell you.
[2936.20 → 2939.60] If you know his will and have studied his law, listen up.
[2940.04 → 2941.02] This is for you.
[2941.36 → 2946.80] If you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind and a light for those who are in the dark.
[2946.80 → 2953.82] Actually, this is language that's taken directly out of Isaiah 42, verse 16.
[2955.12 → 2955.54] Right?
[2955.60 → 2960.06] And it's about what God will do through the servant of the Lord.
[2960.82 → 2963.52] And they have adopted it for themselves.
[2965.08 → 2968.40] And then Paul now connects that directly to verse 20.
[2968.40 → 2975.68] He says, if you are an instructor of the foolish and a teacher of children because you have knowledge and truth.
[2976.08 → 2980.84] And all of this is building on an idea that we can tie back to Genesis 12.
[2981.34 → 2984.60] And in Genesis 12, God first approaches Abram.
[2984.76 → 2986.70] Then his name is eventually changed to Abraham.
[2987.38 → 2987.52] Right?
[2987.52 → 2993.28] And God promises to bless him and to make his descendants into a great nation.
[2993.66 → 2997.60] And the purpose of that blessing and that great nation, he ends in Genesis 12, verse 3,
[2997.68 → 3002.38] is that all people on earth will be blessed through you.
[3004.22 → 3004.40] Right?
[3004.48 → 3008.30] The Jewish people had a built-in purpose.
[3008.30 → 3018.56] They have a commission from God to reveal him to the nations and to be a blessing to them as God's chosen people.
[3019.06 → 3024.86] And they took pride in all of this as identifying features.
[3025.60 → 3028.64] And so remember, Paul is gathering them all up.
[3028.74 → 3031.68] He's drawing them in so that they will hear.
[3031.68 → 3039.36] Because it would be easy for them to listen to everything he has said so far about others.
[3040.22 → 3042.84] And he wants to include them.
[3044.10 → 3048.54] And like I said, as we sit here now 2,000 some odd years later,
[3048.54 → 3053.78] it's even easier for you and me to other this text.
[3055.36 → 3055.80] Right?
[3055.86 → 3058.48] To think that this is about someone other than me.
[3058.60 → 3061.04] And so I'm going to paraphrase it, this first part.
[3062.12 → 3063.28] I'm going to paraphrase it.
[3063.34 → 3064.50] I'm going to make a small change.
[3064.88 → 3065.10] Right?
[3065.22 → 3070.04] That hopefully connecting to Paul's intent that he would have had back then.
[3070.30 → 3072.92] And so listen to the same verses this way.
[3074.30 → 3080.98] If you call yourself a Christian, a born-again, Bible-believing Christian,
[3081.64 → 3084.60] if you have studied the Bible, if you've done profession of faith,
[3084.60 → 3087.38] and if you've been in small groups all of your life,
[3087.38 → 3091.68] if you've taught an Alpha course or taught a Christianity Explored course,
[3091.92 → 3095.52] or you've volunteered in Sunday school or in children's worship time,
[3095.66 → 3099.78] if you have done all of these things, this is for you.
[3099.78 → 3107.72] And so for you, born and raised Christian folk,
[3108.72 → 3112.22] this is for you.
[3112.22 → 3116.60] Now, right away, and again, don't hear what I'm not saying, right?
[3116.66 → 3119.52] Because Paul is not saying that there's anything wrong with being a Jew
[3119.52 → 3122.06] or there's anything wrong with these identifying markers.
[3122.32 → 3125.90] He's not saying there's anything wrong with knowing God's law
[3125.90 → 3127.72] or having it written on your heart.
[3128.38 → 3128.64] Right?
[3128.70 → 3131.02] That's what they're commanded to do in Deuteronomy.
[3131.02 → 3135.30] He's not saying there's anything wrong with using God's law, his Torah,
[3135.54 → 3137.54] to help you make decisions in your life
[3137.54 → 3140.86] and to seek his purposes for what you might do.
[3141.54 → 3145.60] The problem, Paul says, and you can look closely at verse 17 to see it,
[3145.66 → 3152.10] the problem is those who rely on the law,
[3152.36 → 3156.20] those who boast, who brag.
[3157.36 → 3157.60] Right?
[3157.62 → 3160.38] It's not their Jewishness or their having the law.
[3160.38 → 3162.88] It's the presumption of what that means.
[3164.06 → 3164.12] Right?
[3164.24 → 3166.32] It's the presumption that they make
[3166.32 → 3169.22] that is the attitude that they carry.
[3169.80 → 3173.08] They are relying on these good things,
[3173.26 → 3176.24] their moral things or these religious systems.
[3177.48 → 3179.02] As one writer says,
[3179.18 → 3183.38] there's not much difference between the words morality and moralism,
[3183.62 → 3186.04] but there is an eternal world of difference
[3186.04 → 3188.24] between making a good thing, morality,
[3188.82 → 3190.36] into your God.
[3190.38 → 3191.96] which is moralism.
[3194.06 → 3198.56] One of the most dangerous things for Christians in the world today
[3198.56 → 3204.36] is when it comes to understanding our faith
[3204.36 → 3208.40] is the danger of Christian moralism.
[3208.40 → 3213.26] Now, this shows up in two kinds of ways.
[3214.46 → 3214.66] Right?
[3214.70 → 3217.18] Whenever you talk about something that you have done,
[3217.54 → 3222.82] a good thing that you have done in a way that is intended to earn the praise of others
[3222.82 → 3227.08] or is intended to boost your standing among them,
[3228.22 → 3232.16] right, to boost your standing in your own heart and your own mind,
[3232.16 → 3238.22] then you are relying on your own good works to earn merit
[3238.22 → 3241.34] or to earn favour or to earn status.
[3241.34 → 3241.74] Right?
[3242.38 → 3245.24] With them and with God.
[3245.24 → 3248.80] But also on the other end of this, right,
[3248.98 → 3250.94] whenever you say something like,
[3251.50 → 3252.98] I'm too sinful.
[3253.98 → 3254.18] Right?
[3254.22 → 3257.02] Or God could never forgive this in my life.
[3257.30 → 3259.22] I've done way too many wrong things.
[3259.70 → 3259.82] Right?
[3259.88 → 3262.00] Whether you're on one side or the other,
[3262.00 → 3267.12] you're living out of a perspective of a functional Christian moralist.
[3267.12 → 3271.22] And the question that Paul is asking in verse 21
[3271.22 → 3277.06] is intended to get you to reflect on whether this is what you are doing.
[3277.78 → 3281.84] Whether you are living as a religious moralist.
[3281.88 → 3282.10] He says,
[3282.26 → 3285.20] You then who teach others, do you not teach yourself?
[3286.28 → 3289.04] You who preach against stealing, do you steal?
[3292.14 → 3295.00] In the early and mid-20th century,
[3295.00 → 3300.36] there was a British preacher by the name of D. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[3301.44 → 3306.08] And he applies this question to professing Christians in a powerful way.
[3306.14 → 3307.08] It's a bit of a longer quote.
[3307.24 → 3308.10] You will see it there.
[3309.10 → 3311.10] But hear it as I read.
[3312.62 → 3313.22] He asks,
[3313.40 → 3315.64] As you read your Bible day by day,
[3315.76 → 3318.72] do you apply the truth to yourself?
[3319.62 → 3321.80] What is your motive when you read the Bible?
[3321.80 → 3326.08] Is it just to have a knowledge of it so that you can show off to others
[3326.08 → 3328.20] how much you know and argue with them?
[3328.46 → 3331.34] Or are you applying the truth to yourselves?
[3332.94 → 3333.16] Right?
[3333.22 → 3335.00] As you read, say to yourself,
[3335.12 → 3335.88] This is me.
[3336.38 → 3338.04] What is this thing about me?
[3338.22 → 3340.38] Allow the scripture to search you.
[3340.76 → 3343.88] Otherwise, it can be very dangerous.
[3343.88 → 3347.04] There is a sense, he continues,
[3347.52 → 3349.54] in which the more you know of the Bible,
[3349.90 → 3351.80] the more dangerous it is to you
[3351.80 → 3354.22] if you do not apply it to yourself.
[3357.14 → 3358.60] And can I be honest with you?
[3359.30 → 3360.58] When I read that this week,
[3361.16 → 3363.42] that cut me.
[3364.62 → 3365.74] That got me.
[3366.02 → 3366.90] Because that's me.
[3368.06 → 3370.72] That's how I default to reading the Bible.
[3370.80 → 3371.36] I'm a preacher.
[3371.36 → 3372.40] I'm a teacher.
[3372.84 → 3375.36] And so I always read the Bible thinking,
[3375.86 → 3377.14] How can I teach this?
[3378.12 → 3379.98] And how can I apply this to others?
[3380.64 → 3383.40] How can I remember this so that when I'm in a conversation,
[3383.58 → 3386.42] I can quote it and accurately represent it?
[3388.10 → 3389.16] This is me.
[3390.34 → 3394.96] I need to let the Word of God be living and active in my heart
[3394.96 → 3396.02] and for my heart.
[3396.10 → 3399.72] I need to let the Word of God divide my bone from marrow.
[3399.72 → 3403.30] On these pages are more than just words.
[3403.44 → 3405.80] On these pages are the Word of truth,
[3405.92 → 3407.80] the words of eternal life.
[3409.14 → 3411.22] It does me no good,
[3411.30 → 3412.86] and it do you no good
[3412.86 → 3415.76] to approach these words of God
[3415.76 → 3419.48] from a purely scholastic
[3419.48 → 3423.44] or dry point of view.
[3423.44 → 3425.82] And that's the thing.
[3426.82 → 3431.62] That's the first way we move from moralism
[3431.62 → 3434.74] to a gospel religion.
[3435.16 → 3438.40] That the Word of God has to become alive to you.
[3439.98 → 3441.24] Let me put it another way.
[3442.44 → 3447.00] The Word of God is life for you.
[3447.00 → 3450.32] And if you feel like the Bible
[3450.32 → 3451.96] and reading the Bible is a chore
[3451.96 → 3453.44] or a burden,
[3454.50 → 3455.62] maybe
[3455.62 → 3458.90] you're stuck in Christian moralism.
[3461.42 → 3462.78] And if that's you,
[3463.78 → 3466.70] with sensitivity
[3466.70 → 3468.46] and empathy,
[3468.46 → 3472.00] can I just say that
[3472.00 → 3473.80] your moralism
[3473.80 → 3475.44] will fail you.
[3476.82 → 3477.96] Your moralism
[3477.96 → 3479.00] will fail you
[3479.00 → 3480.88] because we are all inconsistent
[3480.88 → 3482.22] with our morality.
[3482.40 → 3483.44] We're all inconsistent
[3483.44 → 3484.56] with our behaviour.
[3484.80 → 3486.62] No matter how hard we try,
[3487.00 → 3488.44] there is failure.
[3488.68 → 3489.52] And that's the point
[3489.52 → 3490.30] that Paul is making
[3490.30 → 3491.26] in this section.
[3491.40 → 3492.64] He starts with those questions
[3492.64 → 3494.08] that we've already looked at.
[3494.12 → 3494.30] He says,
[3494.40 → 3495.16] you who teach others,
[3495.24 → 3496.10] do you not teach yourselves?
[3496.42 → 3497.58] You who preach against stealing,
[3497.58 → 3498.28] do you not steal?
[3498.34 → 3499.32] And then he goes right on
[3499.32 → 3500.42] with this line of questioning.
[3500.58 → 3500.78] He says,
[3501.44 → 3502.32] you say that people
[3502.32 → 3503.72] should not commit adultery.
[3503.90 → 3505.20] Do you commit adultery?
[3505.54 → 3507.00] You who abhor idols,
[3507.44 → 3508.80] do you rob temples?
[3509.80 → 3511.44] Now that's a fascinating phrase.
[3512.22 → 3513.08] Rob temples.
[3513.20 → 3514.36] And so I want to dig into that
[3514.36 → 3514.74] for a minute.
[3515.06 → 3517.80] Because Paul is probably
[3517.80 → 3519.76] not literally talking about
[3519.76 → 3522.64] people going into temples
[3522.64 → 3524.74] and stealing the statues
[3524.74 → 3525.64] for the gold
[3525.64 → 3526.54] that they're made of
[3526.54 → 3527.44] or the precious metal
[3527.44 → 3528.56] that they're made of
[3528.56 → 3529.28] or whatever
[3529.28 → 3530.58] for that value.
[3530.82 → 3532.88] He's probably using that phrase
[3532.88 → 3534.06] in a figurative way.
[3535.02 → 3535.16] Right?
[3535.22 → 3536.14] It's like he's saying,
[3536.56 → 3537.92] you may not bow down
[3537.92 → 3538.92] to these idols
[3538.92 → 3540.54] or to this statue,
[3540.54 → 3542.06] but you are actually
[3542.06 → 3543.64] guilty of worshipping
[3543.64 → 3544.76] the idol
[3544.76 → 3545.56] or the idea
[3545.56 → 3546.36] that's underneath
[3546.36 → 3547.36] the statue
[3547.36 → 3548.94] or behind the surface
[3548.94 → 3549.86] of the statue.
[3549.98 → 3550.86] That is the meaning
[3550.86 → 3552.00] that it represents.
[3553.48 → 3553.66] Right?
[3553.68 → 3554.28] Let's say that you,
[3554.28 → 3556.94] just to take anything
[3556.94 → 3558.72] in your life
[3558.72 → 3560.04] and you give it
[3560.04 → 3561.52] ultimate purpose
[3561.52 → 3563.12] or you find in it
[3563.12 → 3564.32] your meaning.
[3565.12 → 3565.24] Right?
[3565.24 → 3567.24] If you look for power
[3567.24 → 3567.90] or comfort
[3567.90 → 3568.84] to that thing
[3568.84 → 3570.68] or if you look for peace
[3570.68 → 3572.00] to that job
[3572.00 → 3573.56] or if you look for wholeness
[3573.56 → 3574.86] in that person
[3574.86 → 3576.12] or if you look for safety
[3576.12 → 3577.12] and pleasure
[3577.12 → 3578.58] in your accomplishments.
[3578.82 → 3578.92] Right?
[3578.92 → 3580.70] If you look to that thing
[3580.70 → 3582.52] more than you look to God,
[3583.02 → 3585.62] you are making an idol of it
[3585.62 → 3586.72] and you have violated
[3586.72 → 3587.60] this command
[3587.60 → 3589.10] against idolatry
[3589.10 → 3590.32] just as much
[3590.32 → 3591.02] as the person
[3591.02 → 3592.34] who physically bows
[3592.34 → 3594.26] to the statue of wood
[3594.26 → 3595.14] or gold
[3595.14 → 3596.12] or whatever it may be
[3596.12 → 3596.82] to the statues
[3596.82 → 3597.12] that,
[3597.48 → 3598.08] what does Paul say,
[3598.16 → 3599.24] you abhor.
[3600.94 → 3601.64] In fact,
[3601.72 → 3602.70] for so many of us
[3602.70 → 3603.54] in the world today
[3603.54 → 3604.54] and in the church
[3604.54 → 3605.76] perhaps even today,
[3607.02 → 3608.30] Christian moralism
[3608.30 → 3610.46] is that new statue,
[3611.34 → 3612.06] is that idol.
[3613.26 → 3614.26] The new idol
[3614.26 → 3616.76] is religion
[3616.76 → 3619.40] and you use it
[3619.40 → 3620.34] to cover up
[3620.34 → 3622.10] your dead heart.
[3622.82 → 3623.70] You use it
[3623.70 → 3624.42] to ignore
[3624.42 → 3626.24] your stuffed up ears
[3626.24 → 3627.46] so that you can't hear
[3627.46 → 3629.04] the living word of God.
[3629.32 → 3629.98] You pretend
[3629.98 → 3632.18] because it looks good
[3632.18 → 3633.38] on the outside,
[3633.80 → 3634.78] you must be good
[3634.78 → 3636.02] on the inside.
[3637.46 → 3637.80] And again,
[3637.80 → 3638.98] verse 21 to 23,
[3639.10 → 3640.20] Paul is gathering us
[3640.20 → 3641.22] all up
[3641.22 → 3642.80] and he's showing us,
[3643.26 → 3644.34] myself included,
[3644.72 → 3647.26] that we are all hypocrites.
[3648.82 → 3649.24] Now,
[3649.28 → 3650.42] I've already admitted it,
[3650.66 → 3650.88] right,
[3650.96 → 3652.92] but I'm a hypocrite
[3652.92 → 3655.18] and I know
[3655.18 → 3656.04] that you,
[3656.26 → 3657.08] every one of you,
[3657.76 → 3658.98] are hypocrites.
[3658.98 → 3661.02] and look,
[3661.30 → 3662.10] at verse 24,
[3662.10 → 3665.00] the price of our hypocrisy,
[3665.86 → 3666.60] as it is written,
[3666.90 → 3667.54] God's name
[3667.54 → 3668.68] is being blasphemed
[3668.68 → 3669.86] among the Gentiles
[3669.86 → 3671.16] because of you.
[3672.90 → 3673.00] Right,
[3673.06 → 3673.60] hypocrites
[3673.60 → 3674.72] are the reason
[3674.72 → 3675.86] why so many people
[3675.86 → 3677.24] don't take your faith
[3677.24 → 3678.16] seriously
[3678.16 → 3679.74] or don't take you seriously
[3679.74 → 3681.28] when you talk about faith.
[3682.00 → 3682.86] It's hypocrites
[3682.86 → 3683.60] in the church
[3683.60 → 3684.62] that is the reason
[3684.62 → 3685.74] why so many people
[3685.74 → 3686.94] are deconstructing
[3686.94 → 3687.38] their faith
[3687.38 → 3688.48] and walking away
[3688.48 → 3689.26] from the church
[3689.26 → 3690.22] that they grew up in.
[3691.02 → 3691.80] And honestly,
[3691.88 → 3692.58] I get it.
[3694.06 → 3694.54] Right,
[3694.68 → 3695.66] you and me,
[3696.16 → 3696.94] on our own,
[3697.34 → 3698.06] we give God
[3698.06 → 3698.66] a bad name.
[3699.88 → 3701.06] And when we pretend
[3701.06 → 3701.86] like we've got it
[3701.86 → 3702.68] all figured out
[3702.68 → 3703.78] or when we pretend
[3703.78 → 3704.50] like we have
[3704.50 → 3705.24] all the answers
[3705.24 → 3706.02] or when we pretend
[3706.02 → 3706.96] like we don't have
[3706.96 → 3707.66] questions
[3707.66 → 3708.80] or that we don't struggle,
[3709.06 → 3709.74] when we pretend
[3709.74 → 3710.64] that there are no doubts
[3710.64 → 3711.34] to our faith,
[3711.34 → 3712.80] we aren't helping
[3712.80 → 3714.38] those who are struggling.
[3715.30 → 3716.86] We're just underscoring
[3716.86 → 3718.08] our own hypocrisy.
[3727.22 → 3728.76] But can I also say,
[3729.76 → 3732.84] can I also say
[3732.84 → 3733.86] that my hypocrisy,
[3735.08 → 3736.80] that my fickle heart,
[3736.80 → 3738.28] my doubts,
[3738.78 → 3741.00] aren't big enough
[3741.00 → 3742.34] or powerful enough
[3742.34 → 3744.24] to change the truth
[3744.24 → 3745.24] of God's word.
[3746.46 → 3747.76] That even when
[3747.76 → 3748.98] my faith fails,
[3749.16 → 3751.24] even when my morality fails,
[3751.40 → 3752.70] even when I don't live
[3752.70 → 3753.66] as the new creation
[3753.66 → 3754.92] that I am called
[3754.92 → 3756.78] and recreated to be,
[3756.92 → 3758.00] regenerated to be,
[3758.10 → 3759.48] declared by God
[3759.48 → 3760.78] in grace to be,
[3761.18 → 3762.06] even when I don't live
[3762.06 → 3762.44] into that,
[3762.60 → 3763.30] even then,
[3763.58 → 3765.78] God is good.
[3765.78 → 3767.84] God's truth
[3767.84 → 3768.86] is not dependent
[3768.86 → 3770.34] upon my ability
[3770.34 → 3771.36] to live it.
[3772.06 → 3773.56] The gospel is true
[3773.56 → 3775.34] even if I haven't
[3775.34 → 3776.80] been fully transformed
[3776.80 → 3777.98] by it.
[3779.88 → 3780.52] And so,
[3781.16 → 3782.72] if you
[3782.72 → 3785.12] are doubting God
[3785.12 → 3787.04] because of your
[3787.04 → 3788.48] particular experience
[3788.48 → 3789.40] of Christians,
[3790.72 → 3792.86] can I just say
[3792.86 → 3795.62] that's not entirely fair.
[3795.78 → 3798.36] Now,
[3798.42 → 3798.88] I own
[3798.88 → 3800.16] that I'm a hypocrite
[3800.16 → 3802.18] and so are we all.
[3802.58 → 3803.42] And I understand
[3803.42 → 3804.66] that if you have been hurt
[3804.66 → 3805.28] by the church
[3805.28 → 3805.96] in the past,
[3806.16 → 3807.08] if you have been hurt
[3807.08 → 3807.90] by Christians,
[3808.34 → 3810.12] and that's something
[3810.12 → 3810.88] that will,
[3811.10 → 3812.32] that has to
[3812.32 → 3814.28] colour and determine
[3814.28 → 3815.00] your opinion
[3815.00 → 3815.92] and your perspective
[3815.92 → 3817.40] because that experience
[3817.40 → 3818.60] is real.
[3818.68 → 3819.52] And I don't want to minimize
[3819.52 → 3821.00] that real experience,
[3821.44 → 3821.68] right?
[3821.68 → 3823.00] but can I just say
[3823.00 → 3825.18] I'm sorry.
[3827.12 → 3827.32] Right?
[3827.32 → 3828.28] My heart breaks
[3828.28 → 3830.22] for you
[3830.22 → 3831.64] who are in that struggle,
[3832.14 → 3833.14] for you who have faced
[3833.14 → 3834.06] that kind of trauma
[3834.06 → 3835.42] and that kind of trial.
[3835.92 → 3837.06] And I want to be there
[3837.06 → 3837.80] to enter into
[3837.80 → 3838.62] that dark night
[3838.62 → 3839.42] of the soul
[3839.42 → 3839.82] with you
[3839.82 → 3840.76] or whatever that might
[3840.76 → 3841.62] look like,
[3841.70 → 3841.84] right?
[3841.84 → 3842.80] We have people
[3842.80 → 3843.44] who are here
[3843.44 → 3844.08] who want to pray
[3844.08 → 3844.64] with you
[3844.64 → 3845.46] through that
[3845.46 → 3846.22] and you can find them.
[3846.30 → 3847.52] There's yellow name tags
[3847.52 → 3847.98] throughout,
[3848.54 → 3848.74] right?
[3848.74 → 3849.46] You can find them
[3849.46 → 3850.18] and they will pray
[3850.18 → 3850.50] with you.
[3850.56 → 3851.60] We want to be with you
[3851.60 → 3852.46] but please,
[3852.98 → 3853.70] 
[3853.70 → 3856.38] separate the truth
[3856.38 → 3857.64] of who God is
[3857.64 → 3859.98] from my moral failures.
[3861.48 → 3863.06] I will disappoint you.
[3863.96 → 3865.22] I promise you that.
[3866.68 → 3867.88] He will not.
[3869.96 → 3872.12] Don't let my disappointing you
[3872.12 → 3874.56] determine who God is for you.
[3875.24 → 3875.34] Right?
[3875.36 → 3876.80] It's not fair to you
[3876.80 → 3878.54] if you blame God
[3878.54 → 3879.56] for my failings
[3879.56 → 3882.42] because then you're missing him.
[3885.34 → 3885.50] Now,
[3887.02 → 3891.24] I confessed my hypocrisy
[3891.24 → 3892.58] and maybe you could share
[3892.58 → 3894.56] in that confession
[3894.56 → 3897.92] but the difficulty
[3897.92 → 3899.10] with hypocrisy
[3899.10 → 3900.26] is that most of us
[3900.26 → 3901.26] are blind to it.
[3902.78 → 3903.58] And so how do we know
[3903.58 → 3905.14] if we're hiding hypocrisy
[3905.14 → 3906.42] in your heart?
[3906.42 → 3907.32] And let me underscore again
[3907.32 → 3907.94] the purpose
[3907.94 → 3909.44] and the importance
[3909.44 → 3910.88] of asking that question
[3910.88 → 3911.94] because Paul says
[3911.94 → 3913.58] God's name is being blasphemed
[3913.58 → 3914.60] among the Gentiles
[3914.60 → 3915.38] because of you
[3915.38 → 3916.64] and I, for one,
[3916.74 → 3917.90] don't want that to happen.
[3919.74 → 3921.88] A life of Christian moralism
[3921.88 → 3924.00] will always be distasteful
[3924.00 → 3925.16] to those outside
[3925.16 → 3926.48] and rightfully so
[3926.48 → 3927.84] because this person
[3927.84 → 3929.52] appears smug
[3929.52 → 3931.76] because after all,
[3932.48 → 3933.64] well, I really am a good person.
[3933.64 → 3937.66] this kind of person
[3937.66 → 3938.54] and here's how you begin
[3938.54 → 3939.96] to know if this is your own heart,
[3940.04 → 3941.00] this kind of person
[3941.00 → 3943.04] will be overly sensitive
[3943.04 → 3945.10] when you call them out
[3945.10 → 3946.06] on their sin
[3946.06 → 3947.86] or when you hold them accountable
[3947.86 → 3949.36] to their hypocrisy.
[3950.48 → 3951.20] And so,
[3951.34 → 3952.76] if you get overly defensive
[3952.76 → 3954.86] when someone calls you out
[3954.86 → 3955.72] on your sin,
[3956.98 → 3957.72] check your heart
[3957.72 → 3960.88] because maybe there's hypocrisy there.
[3962.62 → 3963.06] Right?
[3963.10 → 3964.30] This kind of person
[3964.30 → 3965.46] who's blind
[3965.46 → 3966.48] to their own hypocrisy
[3966.48 → 3968.08] is going to be judgmental
[3968.08 → 3968.68] of others
[3968.68 → 3969.80] because they need
[3969.80 → 3971.08] to find other people
[3971.08 → 3972.30] who are worse than them
[3972.30 → 3973.76] in order to continue thinking
[3973.76 → 3975.20] that they are actually good enough.
[3975.76 → 3976.40] And so,
[3976.46 → 3977.50] they will point out the faults
[3977.50 → 3979.48] of others around them.
[3980.08 → 3981.18] And this kind of person
[3981.18 → 3982.50] is going to live
[3982.50 → 3983.20] in a state
[3983.20 → 3985.08] of spiritual anxiety
[3985.08 → 3987.42] because they will always
[3987.42 → 3987.98] be worried
[3987.98 → 3988.92] about whether
[3988.92 → 3990.52] they have done enough,
[3990.72 → 3991.18] whether
[3991.18 → 3992.88] they have been good enough.
[3993.78 → 3994.46] Can I tell you,
[3995.42 → 3995.82] in my,
[3997.74 → 3998.10] I don't know,
[3998.14 → 3999.14] how long have I been a pastor?
[3999.28 → 4000.50] 12, 13 years?
[4001.46 → 4004.04] In my 13 years
[4004.04 → 4005.68] of pastoring churches,
[4006.72 → 4007.12] there's,
[4007.20 → 4009.94] there's one circumstance
[4009.94 → 4011.48] of providing pastoral care
[4011.48 → 4013.24] that I will always remember.
[4014.14 → 4014.54] And it's not
[4014.54 → 4015.40] while I was serving here,
[4015.48 → 4016.16] so don't look around
[4016.16 → 4016.96] for who it might be.
[4017.94 → 4019.34] But I was sitting
[4019.34 → 4020.56] at the deathbed
[4020.56 → 4022.24] of a 96-year-old
[4022.24 → 4024.60] saint of the church.
[4025.76 → 4026.58] She had been
[4026.58 → 4028.06] an active participant
[4028.06 → 4029.36] in the life of the church
[4029.36 → 4031.52] her entire life.
[4031.66 → 4032.86] And when we sat down,
[4032.92 → 4033.72] when I sat down
[4033.72 → 4034.42] beside her,
[4034.74 → 4035.94] 96 years old,
[4036.22 → 4036.72] she said,
[4036.86 → 4037.24] Pastor,
[4037.80 → 4039.22] I'm scared to die
[4039.22 → 4040.16] because I don't know
[4040.16 → 4041.50] if I have been good enough.
[4046.54 → 4048.10] She held that anxiety
[4048.10 → 4050.12] in her heart
[4050.12 → 4051.40] even though
[4051.40 → 4052.98] she had been around
[4052.98 → 4054.58] this gospel truth
[4054.58 → 4054.98] of Jesus
[4054.98 → 4056.14] her entire life.
[4056.68 → 4057.92] That's how deep
[4057.92 → 4058.72] these things
[4058.72 → 4060.40] can work in us
[4060.40 → 4062.32] and through us.
[4064.34 → 4065.44] And so let's gather
[4065.44 → 4066.08] each other up.
[4066.58 → 4067.78] Let's look at our own hearts.
[4067.78 → 4068.86] Again,
[4069.04 → 4070.64] I love the way
[4070.64 → 4071.90] that Tim Keller
[4071.90 → 4073.38] summarizes Paul's argument.
[4073.52 → 4073.92] He says,
[4074.02 → 4074.62] and he connects us
[4074.62 → 4075.92] back to Genesis 12 again
[4075.92 → 4078.14] and God's promise
[4078.14 → 4078.62] to Abraham.
[4079.42 → 4080.16] Paul is saying
[4080.16 → 4080.74] to the Jews,
[4081.50 → 4082.56] you were called
[4082.56 → 4083.36] to be a light
[4083.36 → 4083.92] to the world.
[4084.54 → 4085.86] You think of yourselves
[4085.86 → 4086.82] as bringing light
[4086.82 → 4087.52] to those who are
[4087.52 → 4088.04] in darkness
[4088.04 → 4089.38] and yet the world
[4089.38 → 4090.62] finds your religion
[4090.62 → 4092.20] totally unattractive.
[4093.30 → 4094.46] Don't you see
[4094.46 → 4095.36] that therefore
[4095.36 → 4096.80] you must have
[4096.80 → 4097.78] misunderstood it.
[4101.22 → 4102.40] It's so easy
[4102.40 → 4103.06] for us
[4103.06 → 4104.94] to look at a world
[4104.94 → 4105.42] especially
[4105.42 → 4106.40] in a time
[4106.40 → 4106.84] and an age
[4106.84 → 4107.62] that many call
[4107.62 → 4108.28] post-Christian
[4108.28 → 4109.26] or post-Christendom
[4109.26 → 4110.00] and go,
[4110.46 → 4111.36] they just don't
[4111.36 → 4112.04] get it.
[4112.12 → 4112.56] The world
[4112.56 → 4114.10] doesn't understand.
[4115.10 → 4115.94] Turn that question
[4115.94 → 4116.80] back on yourself.
[4116.80 → 4123.62] Have we forgotten
[4123.62 → 4125.48] to make the gospel
[4125.48 → 4126.18] attractive
[4126.18 → 4127.24] because we've been
[4127.24 → 4127.96] stuck
[4127.96 → 4130.04] in our hypocrisy
[4130.04 → 4131.52] and our moralism?
[4132.30 → 4133.22] Do you understand?
[4133.66 → 4134.96] Pose the same question
[4134.96 → 4135.46] to ourselves.
[4135.58 → 4136.86] Is our community,
[4137.30 → 4138.42] our church community
[4138.42 → 4139.36] and you
[4139.36 → 4140.36] as individuals
[4140.36 → 4141.30] in your life
[4141.30 → 4141.96] and in your work
[4141.96 → 4142.50] and school
[4142.50 → 4143.38] and in sports,
[4143.66 → 4144.88] are you attractive
[4144.88 → 4146.68] for the faith?
[4146.82 → 4147.50] Do you show
[4147.50 → 4148.22] humility
[4148.22 → 4149.46] for Jesus?
[4149.70 → 4150.74] And can I just say
[4150.74 → 4151.88] that God has been
[4151.88 → 4152.40] doing something
[4152.40 → 4153.00] in our midst
[4153.00 → 4154.00] here at Emmanuel
[4154.00 → 4154.94] for some time
[4154.94 → 4155.92] and one of the
[4155.92 → 4156.64] exciting things
[4156.64 → 4157.06] that I have
[4157.06 → 4157.82] as part of my job
[4157.82 → 4158.54] is I get to talk
[4158.54 → 4159.06] to the people
[4159.06 → 4159.70] who are visiting
[4159.70 → 4160.14] and who are
[4160.14 → 4160.86] checking us out
[4160.86 → 4161.68] for the first time
[4161.68 → 4162.04] or who are
[4162.04 → 4163.50] interested in membership
[4163.50 → 4164.44] and over and over
[4164.44 → 4165.12] and over again.
[4165.22 → 4165.80] One of the things
[4165.80 → 4167.30] I hear about us
[4167.30 → 4168.92] is that we have
[4168.92 → 4170.20] a meaningful
[4170.20 → 4171.12] and authentic
[4171.12 → 4171.92] community
[4171.92 → 4172.68] that people
[4172.68 → 4173.90] want to have
[4173.90 → 4175.32] something that we have.
[4175.38 → 4176.22] They can't quite name it.
[4176.28 → 4177.12] They can't quite place it
[4177.12 → 4178.40] but there's a draw here
[4178.40 → 4179.36] and so let me say
[4179.36 → 4180.88] yes, we are doing this.
[4181.20 → 4181.84] We get this.
[4181.94 → 4183.26] We understand some of this
[4183.26 → 4186.06] but is there more?
[4187.96 → 4188.82] Is there more?
[4190.66 → 4192.46] Can you show grace
[4192.46 → 4194.48] in the face of failure?
[4195.20 → 4196.48] Can you be non-anxious
[4196.48 → 4197.86] in trying times?
[4198.18 → 4198.80] Are we living
[4198.80 → 4199.98] as signposts
[4199.98 → 4200.48] of the beauty
[4200.48 → 4201.16] of the gospel
[4201.16 → 4202.12] and revealing
[4202.12 → 4203.18] the kingdom come
[4203.18 → 4204.62] in the world
[4204.62 → 4205.50] and revealing
[4205.50 → 4206.44] the kingdom come?
[4207.26 → 4207.86] Or
[4207.86 → 4209.78] in your life
[4209.78 → 4211.60] and in our community
[4211.60 → 4212.08] together
[4212.08 → 4213.80] are we holding up
[4213.80 → 4214.30] a sign
[4214.30 → 4215.32] that says
[4215.32 → 4216.04] do not enter
[4216.04 → 4218.08] hazardous material?
[4221.30 → 4222.16] The moralism
[4222.16 → 4223.36] offers only
[4223.36 → 4224.04] what some
[4224.04 → 4224.82] have called
[4224.82 → 4225.64] dead
[4225.64 → 4227.12] orthodoxy.
[4227.12 → 4229.34] And it's only
[4229.34 → 4230.00] the gospel
[4230.00 → 4230.56] of Jesus
[4230.56 → 4231.44] that can transform
[4231.44 → 4232.04] people
[4232.04 → 4234.18] to the kinds
[4234.18 → 4234.80] of people
[4234.80 → 4235.42] that God
[4235.42 → 4236.46] has designed us
[4236.46 → 4237.52] and called us
[4237.52 → 4237.90] to be.
[4238.66 → 4238.98] And in fact
[4238.98 → 4240.06] it's this idea
[4240.06 → 4240.72] of dead
[4240.72 → 4241.80] orthodoxy
[4241.80 → 4242.82] that Paul finishes
[4242.82 → 4244.44] with in verse 25
[4244.44 → 4245.34] to the end.
[4246.16 → 4246.32] Now
[4246.32 → 4247.60] previously
[4247.60 → 4248.48] in this series
[4248.48 → 4249.10] on Romans
[4249.10 → 4249.96] we have had
[4249.96 → 4251.20] purpose
[4251.20 → 4253.14] to call out
[4253.14 → 4254.56] progressive Christians
[4254.56 → 4255.56] and the way
[4255.56 → 4256.10] that progressive
[4256.10 → 4256.54] Christians
[4256.54 → 4257.12] have adjusted
[4257.12 → 4257.66] the teaching
[4257.66 → 4258.50] of the Bible
[4258.50 → 4258.84] the way
[4258.84 → 4259.50] that some
[4259.50 → 4259.84] progressive
[4259.84 → 4260.24] Christians
[4260.24 → 4261.08] have licensed
[4261.08 → 4262.18] their own
[4262.18 → 4262.70] or others
[4262.70 → 4263.40] immorality.
[4264.08 → 4264.84] But here's
[4264.84 → 4265.18] what I need
[4265.18 → 4265.58] you to hear
[4265.58 → 4266.32] because now
[4266.32 → 4267.34] Paul is talking
[4267.34 → 4267.94] to you
[4267.94 → 4268.62] conservative
[4268.62 → 4270.14] Christians.
[4270.88 → 4271.60] For those
[4271.60 → 4271.80] of you
[4271.80 → 4272.08] who are
[4272.08 → 4273.12] traditionalists
[4273.12 → 4273.98] on a lot
[4273.98 → 4274.72] of these things
[4274.72 → 4275.64] for those
[4275.64 → 4275.88] of you
[4275.88 → 4276.14] who have
[4276.14 → 4276.50] what we've
[4276.50 → 4277.04] come to call
[4277.04 → 4277.74] in western
[4277.74 → 4278.26] politics
[4278.26 → 4279.50] social conservatives
[4279.50 → 4280.90] Paul is
[4280.90 → 4281.58] calling you out.
[4281.58 → 4284.12] verse 25
[4284.12 → 4284.76] he shifts
[4284.76 → 4285.08] to an
[4285.08 → 4285.58] illustration
[4285.58 → 4286.62] from circumcision.
[4287.50 → 4287.64] Now
[4287.64 → 4288.98] particularly
[4288.98 → 4289.70] for the young
[4289.70 → 4290.34] ones among you
[4290.34 → 4290.98] if you don't
[4290.98 → 4291.34] know what
[4291.34 → 4292.32] circumcision is
[4292.32 → 4293.48] I'm going to
[4293.48 → 4293.88] let you talk
[4293.88 → 4294.36] to your parents.
[4296.22 → 4297.16] They can answer
[4297.16 → 4297.68] that question
[4297.68 → 4298.06] for you.
[4298.80 → 4299.56] What I'm going
[4299.56 → 4299.94] to say
[4299.94 → 4300.78] for us here
[4300.78 → 4301.88] is that
[4301.88 → 4302.42] circumcision
[4302.42 → 4303.34] is a symbol
[4303.34 → 4304.20] it's a physical
[4304.20 → 4304.70] symbol
[4304.70 → 4305.86] that was used
[4305.86 → 4306.86] to mark out
[4306.86 → 4307.90] and identify
[4307.90 → 4309.00] the people
[4309.00 → 4309.60] of Israel
[4309.60 → 4310.12] the Jewish
[4310.12 → 4310.48] people.
[4310.48 → 4311.98] And circumcision
[4311.98 → 4312.84] had become
[4312.84 → 4313.68] the basis
[4313.68 → 4314.52] for their
[4314.52 → 4315.12] cultural
[4315.12 → 4316.12] identity
[4316.12 → 4317.66] and the basis
[4317.66 → 4319.44] as the basis
[4319.44 → 4319.82] for their
[4319.82 → 4320.74] cultural identity
[4320.74 → 4322.04] it had become
[4322.04 → 4322.92] the source
[4322.92 → 4323.98] of their
[4323.98 → 4324.74] own
[4324.74 → 4325.66] righteousness.
[4327.02 → 4327.80] Their relationship
[4327.80 → 4328.56] to God
[4328.56 → 4329.62] became based
[4329.62 → 4330.54] on this
[4330.54 → 4331.30] symbol
[4331.30 → 4331.98] on whether
[4331.98 → 4332.38] or not
[4332.38 → 4332.94] you bore
[4332.94 → 4334.34] this marker.
[4335.34 → 4335.60] And again
[4335.60 → 4336.06] just like
[4336.06 → 4336.48] the previous
[4336.48 → 4337.08] section
[4337.08 → 4337.78] perhaps
[4337.78 → 4338.62] many of us
[4338.62 → 4339.36] miss this
[4339.36 → 4340.58] as an illustration
[4340.58 → 4341.04] and so
[4341.04 → 4341.56] I'm going
[4341.56 → 4341.98] to change
[4341.98 → 4342.08] it.
[4342.14 → 4342.26] I'm going
[4342.26 → 4342.72] to update
[4342.72 → 4343.18] it again
[4343.18 → 4344.20] for Christians
[4344.20 → 4344.60] and for
[4344.60 → 4345.06] Christianity
[4345.06 → 4345.48] so I'm going
[4345.48 → 4346.08] to paraphrase
[4346.08 → 4346.54] it is like we
[4346.54 → 4346.86] did at the
[4346.86 → 4347.12] beginning.
[4348.14 → 4348.52] So here
[4348.52 → 4349.10] is the
[4349.10 → 4349.30] same
[4349.30 → 4349.78] illustration.
[4351.88 → 4352.48] So what
[4352.48 → 4353.26] if you
[4353.26 → 4353.56] have been
[4353.56 → 4353.88] baptized?
[4355.18 → 4355.70] So what
[4355.70 → 4356.06] if you
[4356.06 → 4356.54] have made
[4356.54 → 4357.06] profession
[4357.06 → 4357.66] of faith?
[4358.10 → 4358.68] So what
[4358.68 → 4359.04] if you
[4359.04 → 4359.30] have been
[4359.30 → 4359.68] a church
[4359.68 → 4360.02] member
[4360.02 → 4360.94] your entire
[4360.94 → 4361.34] life?
[4361.50 → 4362.28] This only
[4362.28 → 4362.92] counts for
[4362.92 → 4363.42] anything
[4363.42 → 4363.98] if there
[4363.98 → 4364.34] has been
[4364.34 → 4365.36] deep change
[4365.36 → 4366.34] in your life.
[4366.40 → 4366.72] If your
[4366.72 → 4367.14] heart
[4367.14 → 4367.78] has been
[4367.78 → 4368.10] truly
[4368.10 → 4368.62] affected?
[4370.24 → 4371.04] Don't you
[4371.04 → 4371.64] know that
[4371.64 → 4372.10] you are
[4372.10 → 4372.86] not a
[4372.86 → 4373.22] Christian
[4373.22 → 4373.84] if you
[4373.84 → 4374.44] are only
[4374.44 → 4375.44] living as
[4375.44 → 4375.76] one
[4375.76 → 4376.52] externally?
[4377.60 → 4378.32] That real
[4378.32 → 4378.86] Christianity
[4378.86 → 4379.54] is not about
[4379.54 → 4380.48] having confidence
[4380.48 → 4381.02] in the things
[4381.02 → 4382.02] outside
[4382.02 → 4383.00] you to
[4383.00 → 4383.64] know and
[4383.64 → 4384.20] to be a
[4384.20 → 4384.54] Christian
[4384.54 → 4385.22] but it
[4385.22 → 4386.26] is from
[4386.26 → 4386.92] the inside.
[4388.08 → 4388.72] What really
[4388.72 → 4389.42] matters is
[4389.42 → 4389.88] inner
[4389.88 → 4390.70] baptism,
[4391.40 → 4391.64] inner
[4391.64 → 4392.18] profession
[4392.18 → 4392.76] of faith,
[4392.98 → 4393.28] inner
[4393.28 → 4393.94] heart
[4393.94 → 4394.62] membership
[4394.62 → 4395.50] in God's
[4395.50 → 4396.74] people and
[4396.74 → 4397.50] that inner
[4397.50 → 4398.76] truth is a
[4398.76 → 4399.50] supernatural
[4399.50 → 4400.48] work.
[4400.58 → 4400.96] It is a
[4400.96 → 4401.62] work of
[4401.62 → 4403.32] God not
[4403.32 → 4404.22] a human
[4404.22 → 4405.14] work.
[4405.84 → 4406.56] Again Keller
[4406.56 → 4407.16] is so good
[4407.16 → 4407.60] on this he
[4407.60 → 4408.04] hits the nail
[4408.04 → 4408.46] right on the
[4408.46 → 4408.96] head when he
[4408.96 → 4410.40] says it
[4410.40 → 4411.06] is possible
[4411.06 → 4411.72] to trust
[4411.72 → 4412.70] in Christianity
[4412.70 → 4414.60] rather than
[4414.60 → 4415.80] in Christ.
[4418.20 → 4418.94] That's dead
[4418.94 → 4419.74] orthodoxy.
[4422.82 → 4422.96] Right?
[4422.96 → 4425.14] You believe
[4425.14 → 4426.40] the basic
[4426.40 → 4427.50] doctrines of
[4427.50 → 4428.28] scripture.
[4428.66 → 4429.42] You assent
[4429.42 → 4430.26] intellectually
[4430.26 → 4431.30] to them
[4431.30 → 4431.62] but it
[4431.62 → 4432.18] makes no
[4432.18 → 4432.86] difference
[4432.86 → 4434.12] inside.
[4435.24 → 4436.02] There's an
[4436.02 → 4436.48] intellectual
[4436.48 → 4437.34] grasp of
[4437.34 → 4437.94] the gospel
[4437.94 → 4438.76] but there's
[4438.76 → 4439.26] no internal
[4439.26 → 4440.04] transformation.
[4442.04 → 4442.34] Dead
[4442.34 → 4443.28] orthodoxy
[4443.28 → 4444.66] makes church
[4444.66 → 4445.34] and church
[4445.34 → 4446.12] participation
[4446.12 → 4447.80] into a
[4447.80 → 4448.68] safety net
[4448.68 → 4449.44] for people
[4449.44 → 4450.12] who think
[4450.12 → 4450.58] they are
[4450.58 → 4451.04] Christian.
[4453.38 → 4453.94] Dead
[4453.94 → 4454.72] orthodoxy
[4454.72 → 4455.06] is going
[4455.06 → 4455.46] to look
[4455.46 → 4456.18] like producing
[4456.18 → 4457.00] a list
[4457.00 → 4457.78] of rules
[4457.78 → 4458.56] and a list
[4458.56 → 4459.04] of ways
[4459.04 → 4459.48] of being
[4459.48 → 4459.80] in the
[4459.80 → 4460.12] world
[4460.12 → 4460.94] and then
[4460.94 → 4461.30] it's going
[4461.30 → 4461.68] to push
[4461.68 → 4462.20] that list
[4462.20 → 4462.70] on everyone
[4462.70 → 4463.18] else in
[4463.18 → 4463.74] society.
[4465.82 → 4466.38] Dead
[4466.38 → 4467.12] orthodoxy
[4467.12 → 4467.48] is going
[4467.48 → 4467.82] to look
[4467.82 → 4469.08] like angrily
[4469.08 → 4469.88] requiring
[4469.88 → 4470.72] theological
[4470.72 → 4471.60] correctness
[4471.60 → 4472.42] and precision
[4472.42 → 4473.04] and then
[4473.04 → 4473.44] debating
[4473.44 → 4473.94] everyone
[4473.94 → 4474.70] around you
[4474.70 → 4475.14] in order
[4475.14 → 4475.72] to prove
[4475.72 → 4476.12] that you
[4476.12 → 4476.28] are
[4476.28 → 4476.70] correct.
[4479.18 → 4480.28] But also
[4480.28 → 4481.96] a dead
[4481.96 → 4482.72] orthodoxy
[4482.72 → 4482.94] is going
[4482.94 → 4483.12] to do
[4483.12 → 4483.52] the same
[4483.52 → 4483.94] thing
[4483.94 → 4484.48] on the
[4484.48 → 4484.64] other
[4484.64 → 4485.02] side.
[4485.86 → 4486.16] A dead
[4486.16 → 4486.80] orthodoxy
[4486.80 → 4487.02] is going
[4487.02 → 4487.56] to put
[4487.56 → 4488.20] a huge
[4488.20 → 4488.76] emphasis
[4488.76 → 4489.90] on a
[4489.90 → 4490.70] particular
[4490.70 → 4491.86] emotional
[4491.86 → 4492.86] experience
[4492.86 → 4493.74] in church
[4493.74 → 4494.10] or a
[4494.10 → 4494.58] dramatic
[4494.58 → 4495.80] experience
[4495.80 → 4496.70] in worship
[4496.70 → 4498.14] and displaying
[4498.14 → 4498.98] your feelings
[4498.98 → 4499.72] in a particular
[4499.72 → 4500.42] way because
[4500.42 → 4500.90] when you get
[4500.90 → 4501.64] your emotions
[4501.64 → 4502.26] right
[4502.26 → 4503.82] then you
[4503.82 → 4504.04] have
[4504.04 → 4504.68] righteousness.
[4507.02 → 4507.30] A dead
[4507.30 → 4508.02] orthodoxy
[4508.02 → 4508.32] is going
[4508.32 → 4508.72] to show
[4508.72 → 4509.70] up in
[4509.70 → 4510.12] the middle
[4510.12 → 4510.82] of those
[4510.82 → 4511.70] two as
[4511.70 → 4512.30] someone who
[4512.30 → 4513.06] puts great
[4513.06 → 4514.00] emphasis on
[4514.00 → 4514.78] the rituals
[4514.78 → 4515.50] and the
[4515.50 → 4516.00] repetition
[4516.00 → 4516.96] of the
[4516.96 → 4517.42] tradition.
[4518.18 → 4518.88] Whether it's
[4518.88 → 4519.24] having the
[4519.24 → 4519.82] building look
[4519.82 → 4520.32] a particular
[4520.32 → 4520.94] way and
[4520.94 → 4521.84] requiring that
[4521.84 → 4522.14] or whether
[4522.14 → 4522.78] it's having
[4522.78 → 4523.44] the right
[4523.44 → 4523.98] kind of
[4523.98 → 4524.52] music
[4524.52 → 4525.98] as the
[4525.98 → 4526.82] only way
[4526.82 → 4527.68] to experience
[4527.68 → 4528.16] this.
[4529.08 → 4529.72] What we
[4529.72 → 4530.80] hear is
[4530.80 → 4531.62] that right
[4531.62 → 4532.64] liturgy
[4532.64 → 4533.68] equals
[4533.68 → 4535.00] righteousness.
[4536.82 → 4537.40] Now again
[4537.40 → 4538.06] right
[4538.06 → 4539.34] theological
[4539.34 → 4540.02] accuracy
[4540.02 → 4540.80] matters.
[4541.06 → 4541.38] Moral
[4541.38 → 4541.80] living
[4541.80 → 4542.42] matters.
[4542.58 → 4542.90] Praying
[4542.90 → 4543.46] and singing
[4543.46 → 4543.80] in the
[4543.80 → 4544.38] power of
[4544.38 → 4544.96] the spirit
[4544.96 → 4545.58] matters.
[4545.72 → 4545.92] Being
[4545.92 → 4546.34] affected
[4546.34 → 4546.72] by the
[4546.72 → 4547.08] gospel
[4547.08 → 4547.72] truths
[4547.72 → 4547.94] and
[4547.94 → 4548.32] beautiful
[4548.32 → 4548.72] worship
[4548.72 → 4548.94] and
[4548.94 → 4549.70] beautiful
[4549.70 → 4550.12] worship
[4550.12 → 4550.90] spaces
[4550.90 → 4551.56] right
[4551.56 → 4551.88] all of
[4551.88 → 4552.02] these
[4552.02 → 4552.20] are
[4552.20 → 4552.60] good
[4552.60 → 4553.38] things
[4553.38 → 4553.60] but
[4553.60 → 4553.92] those
[4553.92 → 4554.24] things
[4554.24 → 4554.72] so
[4554.72 → 4555.68] easily
[4555.68 → 4556.02] and
[4556.02 → 4556.30] so
[4556.30 → 4557.02] regularly
[4557.02 → 4557.40] for
[4557.40 → 4557.68] many
[4557.68 → 4557.94] of
[4557.94 → 4558.18] us
[4558.18 → 4559.12] especially
[4559.12 → 4560.04] if
[4560.04 → 4560.28] you
[4560.28 → 4560.70] are a
[4560.70 → 4561.56] traditionalist
[4561.56 → 4562.04] especially
[4562.04 → 4562.58] if you
[4562.58 → 4562.88] lean
[4562.88 → 4563.44] towards
[4563.44 → 4563.90] the
[4563.90 → 4564.40] conservative
[4564.40 → 4565.36] so many
[4565.36 → 4565.80] of those
[4565.80 → 4566.14] things
[4566.14 → 4566.90] can become
[4566.90 → 4567.48] time and
[4567.48 → 4568.08] time again
[4568.08 → 4569.24] dead works
[4569.24 → 4570.08] and dead
[4570.08 → 4570.86] orthodoxy.
[4571.64 → 4572.00] It is a
[4572.00 → 4572.70] replacement
[4572.70 → 4573.60] for a
[4573.60 → 4574.26] reliance
[4574.26 → 4575.04] on
[4575.04 → 4576.02] Christ.
[4579.54 → 4580.52] It is a
[4580.52 → 4581.08] replacement
[4581.08 → 4582.56] from a
[4582.56 → 4583.12] reliance
[4583.12 → 4583.74] on Christ
[4583.74 → 4584.56] to a
[4584.56 → 4585.06] reliance
[4585.06 → 4585.82] on what
[4585.82 → 4586.26] you do
[4586.26 → 4587.48] or how
[4587.48 → 4587.90] you do
[4587.90 → 4588.08] it
[4588.08 → 4589.16] or what
[4589.16 → 4589.50] you make
[4589.50 → 4589.84] others
[4589.84 → 4590.16] do
[4590.16 → 4592.64] and
[4592.64 → 4592.82] maybe
[4592.82 → 4592.98] even
[4592.98 → 4593.12] how
[4593.12 → 4593.26] you
[4593.26 → 4593.56] feel.
[4594.92 → 4595.26] It is
[4595.26 → 4595.82] possible
[4595.82 → 4596.50] to trust
[4596.50 → 4597.26] Christianity
[4597.26 → 4598.26] rather than
[4598.26 → 4598.84] to trust
[4598.84 → 4599.40] in
[4599.40 → 4600.10] Christ.
[4600.32 → 4600.64] That is
[4600.64 → 4600.82] the
[4600.82 → 4601.32] conservative
[4601.32 → 4602.08] danger
[4602.08 → 4602.68] of
[4602.68 → 4602.92] dead
[4602.92 → 4603.74] orthodoxy.
[4604.34 → 4604.62] What we
[4604.62 → 4605.28] need
[4605.28 → 4606.08] Paul says
[4606.08 → 4606.74] is a
[4606.74 → 4607.40] circumcision
[4607.40 → 4608.08] of the
[4608.08 → 4608.46] heart.
[4608.58 → 4608.82] What we
[4608.82 → 4609.38] need
[4609.38 → 4609.98] is a
[4609.98 → 4610.38] new
[4610.38 → 4611.16] spiritual
[4611.16 → 4612.26] reality.
[4612.26 → 4615.66] in the
[4615.66 → 4616.02] Bible
[4616.02 → 4617.38] covenant
[4617.38 → 4618.16] is the
[4618.16 → 4618.66] word that
[4618.66 → 4619.14] is used
[4619.14 → 4619.68] to talk
[4619.68 → 4620.12] about
[4620.12 → 4620.98] a
[4620.98 → 4621.50] special
[4621.50 → 4621.86] and
[4621.86 → 4622.54] intentional
[4622.54 → 4623.20] kind
[4623.20 → 4623.70] of
[4623.70 → 4624.20] relationship.
[4625.02 → 4625.28] In
[4625.28 → 4625.68] today's
[4625.68 → 4625.92] world
[4625.92 → 4626.08] we
[4626.08 → 4626.36] really
[4626.36 → 4626.74] only
[4626.74 → 4627.62] use
[4627.62 → 4627.88] that
[4627.88 → 4628.14] word
[4628.14 → 4628.36] in
[4628.36 → 4628.68] dry
[4628.68 → 4629.12] legal
[4629.12 → 4629.66] documents
[4629.66 → 4629.80] or
[4629.80 → 4633.26] in
[4633.26 → 4633.38] the
[4633.38 → 4633.70] context
[4633.70 → 4633.88] of
[4633.88 → 4634.26] marriage.
[4634.76 → 4634.94] We
[4634.94 → 4635.10] talk
[4635.10 → 4635.26] about
[4635.26 → 4635.58] marriage
[4635.58 → 4635.78] as
[4635.78 → 4635.90] a
[4635.90 → 4636.12] covenant.
[4636.70 → 4636.88] In
[4636.88 → 4637.00] the
[4637.00 → 4637.30] ancient
[4637.30 → 4637.58] Near
[4637.58 → 4638.12] East
[4638.12 → 4640.70] covenants
[4640.70 → 4641.30] defined
[4641.30 → 4641.82] so many
[4641.82 → 4642.12] different
[4642.12 → 4642.54] aspects
[4642.54 → 4642.74] of
[4642.74 → 4643.28] relationships.
[4643.50 → 4643.84] Nations
[4643.84 → 4644.18] would
[4644.18 → 4644.46] enter
[4644.46 → 4644.82] into
[4644.82 → 4645.36] covenants
[4645.36 → 4646.06] together.
[4646.28 → 4646.62] Kings
[4646.62 → 4647.02] would
[4647.02 → 4647.30] enter
[4647.30 → 4647.64] into
[4647.64 → 4648.22] covenants
[4648.22 → 4648.90] together.
[4649.06 → 4649.50] And kings
[4649.50 → 4649.92] would enter
[4649.92 → 4650.18] into
[4650.18 → 4650.58] covenants
[4650.58 → 4651.12] with
[4651.12 → 4651.54] their
[4651.54 → 4652.68] vassals,
[4652.86 → 4653.08] with the
[4653.08 → 4653.32] people
[4653.32 → 4653.54] they
[4653.54 → 4654.30] served.
[4655.18 → 4655.70] And part
[4655.70 → 4656.02] of the
[4656.02 → 4656.46] structure
[4656.46 → 4657.10] of the
[4657.10 → 4657.48] covenant
[4657.48 → 4658.24] ceremony
[4658.24 → 4659.02] in the
[4659.02 → 4659.32] ancient
[4659.32 → 4659.58] Near
[4659.58 → 4659.80] East,
[4659.86 → 4660.04] and we
[4660.04 → 4660.46] see this
[4660.46 → 4660.64] in
[4660.64 → 4661.50] circumcision,
[4661.62 → 4661.88] we see
[4661.88 → 4662.22] this in
[4662.22 → 4662.50] other
[4662.50 → 4663.10] covenants
[4663.10 → 4663.46] in the
[4663.46 → 4663.80] Bible,
[4664.28 → 4664.46] right,
[4664.50 → 4664.88] is that
[4664.88 → 4665.90] there would
[4665.90 → 4666.32] be a
[4666.32 → 4666.80] symbol
[4666.80 → 4668.82] that
[4668.82 → 4669.28] says,
[4670.10 → 4670.34] if I
[4670.34 → 4670.62] don't
[4670.62 → 4671.16] keep up
[4671.16 → 4671.78] my end
[4671.78 → 4672.08] of the
[4672.08 → 4672.44] bargain,
[4673.20 → 4673.78] may this
[4673.78 → 4674.26] happen to
[4674.26 → 4674.46] me.
[4675.80 → 4676.04] And so
[4676.04 → 4676.46] for instance,
[4676.54 → 4677.00] you can read
[4677.00 → 4677.64] a story in
[4677.64 → 4678.42] Genesis 15
[4678.42 → 4679.34] of God
[4679.34 → 4680.00] entering into
[4680.00 → 4680.58] a covenant
[4680.58 → 4681.80] with Abraham
[4681.80 → 4683.18] where two
[4683.18 → 4684.28] animals are
[4684.28 → 4684.62] cut in
[4684.62 → 4685.04] half,
[4685.94 → 4686.16] right,
[4686.22 → 4686.88] and God
[4686.88 → 4688.00] walks through
[4688.00 → 4689.04] those two
[4689.04 → 4690.26] animals after
[4690.26 → 4690.76] they're cut in
[4690.76 → 4691.04] half,
[4691.08 → 4691.34] and that's
[4691.34 → 4692.08] God taking
[4692.08 → 4692.28] the
[4692.28 → 4693.12] responsibility
[4693.12 → 4695.00] on himself
[4695.00 → 4695.62] saying,
[4696.26 → 4697.56] may I
[4697.56 → 4698.30] be as
[4698.30 → 4698.96] these two
[4698.96 → 4699.84] animals if
[4699.84 → 4700.30] I don't
[4700.30 → 4700.88] keep up
[4700.88 → 4701.66] my end
[4701.66 → 4702.64] of the
[4702.64 → 4703.02] covenant.
[4704.64 → 4705.22] Circumcision
[4705.22 → 4706.18] is a
[4706.18 → 4706.52] covenant
[4706.52 → 4707.72] symbol,
[4708.18 → 4709.06] right,
[4709.08 → 4709.32] and it
[4709.32 → 4709.60] says,
[4710.10 → 4710.54] not only
[4710.54 → 4711.14] have I
[4711.14 → 4711.62] been cut
[4711.62 → 4712.02] off from
[4712.02 → 4712.36] the rest
[4712.36 → 4712.56] of the
[4712.56 → 4712.82] world,
[4712.92 → 4713.20] that is
[4713.20 → 4713.80] separated
[4713.80 → 4714.18] out,
[4714.30 → 4714.70] marked for
[4714.70 → 4715.16] a purpose,
[4715.52 → 4715.84] but it
[4715.84 → 4716.30] is also
[4716.30 → 4716.86] saying,
[4717.26 → 4717.70] may I
[4717.70 → 4718.66] wholly be
[4718.66 → 4719.22] cut off
[4719.22 → 4719.64] if I
[4719.64 → 4720.00] don't do
[4720.00 → 4720.46] my part,
[4721.06 → 4721.94] if I
[4721.94 → 4722.38] don't do
[4722.38 → 4723.26] and keep
[4723.26 → 4724.24] my promises,
[4725.12 → 4726.10] but the
[4726.10 → 4726.68] symbol is
[4726.68 → 4727.24] only a
[4727.24 → 4727.60] symbol,
[4728.26 → 4729.26] it is
[4729.26 → 4729.76] only a
[4729.76 → 4730.38] symbol if
[4730.38 → 4730.84] it doesn't
[4730.84 → 4731.52] reflect a
[4731.52 → 4731.82] deeper
[4731.82 → 4732.80] reality,
[4732.80 → 4733.80] and that's
[4733.80 → 4734.26] important for
[4734.26 → 4734.48] us to
[4734.48 → 4734.96] remember as
[4734.96 → 4735.14] we are
[4735.14 → 4735.46] about to
[4735.46 → 4736.20] come to
[4736.20 → 4736.58] the Lord's
[4736.58 → 4736.92] table,
[4737.78 → 4738.54] right,
[4738.58 → 4738.86] this is
[4738.86 → 4739.46] only a
[4739.46 → 4741.26] symbol unless
[4741.26 → 4742.36] it reflects
[4742.36 → 4743.82] a true
[4743.82 → 4744.82] and spiritual
[4744.82 → 4746.02] reality,
[4746.02 → 4746.44] and we
[4746.44 → 4747.12] believe that
[4747.12 → 4748.00] this symbol
[4748.00 → 4748.72] reflects the
[4748.72 → 4749.52] reality that
[4749.52 → 4749.82] it is
[4749.82 → 4750.30] Christ
[4750.30 → 4752.10] himself who
[4752.10 → 4753.16] was cut
[4753.16 → 4753.80] off,
[4754.30 → 4754.68] that it
[4754.68 → 4755.08] is Christ
[4755.08 → 4755.72] himself in
[4755.72 → 4756.28] his life
[4756.28 → 4756.86] and in
[4756.86 → 4757.30] his death
[4757.30 → 4757.64] who was
[4757.64 → 4758.54] truly and
[4758.54 → 4759.12] completely
[4759.12 → 4760.56] cut off
[4760.56 → 4761.56] from God
[4761.56 → 4762.16] on our
[4762.16 → 4762.60] behalf,
[4763.28 → 4763.92] and because
[4763.92 → 4764.56] he was cut
[4764.56 → 4765.24] off on our
[4765.24 → 4765.58] behalf,
[4765.98 → 4766.42] and because
[4766.42 → 4767.12] he now,
[4767.26 → 4767.80] by grace
[4767.80 → 4768.38] through faith,
[4768.74 → 4769.50] grants us
[4769.50 → 4770.78] his righteousness,
[4771.20 → 4772.24] we can come
[4772.24 → 4773.50] to this table
[4773.50 → 4774.46] where we can
[4774.46 → 4776.22] really receive
[4776.22 → 4776.58] him,
[4777.84 → 4778.04] right,
[4778.08 → 4779.08] we have
[4779.08 → 4779.64] here,
[4780.12 → 4781.56] circumcision
[4781.56 → 4782.54] of the
[4782.54 → 4782.84] heart,
[4783.84 → 4784.64] Jesus lived
[4784.64 → 4785.06] the life
[4785.06 → 4785.44] I should
[4785.44 → 4785.84] have lived
[4785.84 → 4786.62] and died
[4786.62 → 4787.08] the death
[4787.08 → 4787.36] that I
[4787.36 → 4787.80] deserved,
[4788.24 → 4788.68] Jesus,
[4789.48 → 4790.46] only Jesus,
[4791.74 → 4792.28] rely on
[4792.28 → 4792.56] him,
[4793.76 → 4794.84] rely on
[4794.84 → 4795.10] him,
[4795.18 → 4795.42] and what
[4795.42 → 4795.66] you will
[4795.66 → 4796.22] begin to
[4796.22 → 4797.38] see is
[4797.38 → 4798.02] that your
[4798.02 → 4798.46] dead
[4798.46 → 4799.46] orthodoxy
[4799.46 → 4800.02] can be
[4800.02 → 4800.72] made alive,
[4801.56 → 4801.96] what you
[4801.96 → 4802.28] will begin
[4802.28 → 4802.78] to see
[4802.78 → 4803.18] is that
[4803.18 → 4804.28] the truth
[4804.28 → 4805.18] of the
[4805.18 → 4805.78] gospel
[4805.78 → 4807.28] is life,
[4808.16 → 4808.46] and it
[4808.46 → 4809.08] has joy
[4809.08 → 4809.68] abundant
[4809.68 → 4810.68] for you,
[4811.48 → 4811.62] right,
[4811.66 → 4812.40] rely only
[4812.40 → 4813.00] on him
[4813.00 → 4813.36] and your
[4813.36 → 4813.80] life will
[4813.80 → 4814.54] be transformed
[4814.54 → 4815.28] from the
[4815.28 → 4816.70] inside out
[4816.70 → 4817.26] as you
[4817.26 → 4818.10] are made
[4818.10 → 4818.68] new,
[4818.80 → 4819.48] this is the
[4819.48 → 4820.40] joy of
[4820.40 → 4821.06] the gospel,
[4821.40 → 4821.88] this is what
[4821.88 → 4822.26] Previn
[4822.26 → 4823.06] Wax in his
[4823.06 → 4823.66] book that I'm
[4823.66 → 4824.08] reading right
[4824.08 → 4824.44] now calls
[4824.44 → 4825.04] the thrill
[4825.04 → 4826.12] of orthodoxy,
[4827.06 → 4827.18] right,
[4827.18 → 4827.68] as we come
[4827.68 → 4828.46] to this table,
[4828.56 → 4829.28] I pray that
[4829.28 → 4830.04] that the
[4830.04 → 4830.94] symbol here
[4830.94 → 4832.12] is alive
[4832.12 → 4833.40] for you,
[4833.82 → 4834.56] and that the
[4834.56 → 4835.10] truth of the
[4835.10 → 4835.62] word of God
[4835.62 → 4836.50] proclaimed here
[4836.50 → 4837.48] becomes tangible
[4837.48 → 4838.72] in ways that
[4838.72 → 4839.96] transform your
[4839.96 → 4841.14] dead orthodoxy
[4841.14 → 4842.10] into the joy
[4842.10 → 4843.40] of the gospel,
[4844.24 → 4848.30] we don't trust
[4848.30 → 4850.20] in our morality,
[4850.58 → 4851.32] we don't trust
[4851.32 → 4851.80] in our
[4851.80 → 4852.72] religiosity,
[4852.72 → 4853.62] we don't trust
[4853.62 → 4855.06] in our liturgy,
[4855.56 → 4856.44] but it's here
[4856.44 → 4857.82] and now
[4857.82 → 4858.80] we trust
[4858.80 → 4859.84] in Jesus
[4859.84 → 4861.04] Christ,
[4861.32 → 4863.14] come to the
[4863.14 → 4864.56] table and
[4864.56 → 4866.40] see Jesus
[4866.40 → 4867.34] Christ,
[4867.58 → 4868.52] come to the
[4868.52 → 4869.72] table and
[4869.72 → 4871.78] receive Jesus
[4871.78 → 4873.08] Christ,
[4873.88 → 4874.62] amen,
[4875.16 → 4875.94] let's pray
[4875.94 → 4876.26] together,
[4883.26 → 4884.28] Lord Jesus,
[4884.86 → 4886.88] we come to
[4886.88 → 4888.48] this table,
[4888.80 → 4889.72] because you
[4889.72 → 4890.86] have promised
[4890.86 → 4891.78] to meet
[4891.78 → 4893.12] us here,
[4893.92 → 4894.74] and so meet
[4894.74 → 4895.60] us here in
[4895.60 → 4896.34] the bread and
[4896.34 → 4896.88] in the juice,
[4897.08 → 4898.00] meet us here in
[4898.00 → 4898.64] the power of
[4898.64 → 4899.18] your spirit,
[4899.60 → 4900.62] meet us here as
[4900.62 → 4901.68] you have already
[4901.68 → 4902.82] in your word,
[4903.48 → 4905.92] that we might
[4905.92 → 4907.34] taste and see
[4907.34 → 4908.44] that you
[4908.44 → 4910.18] are good,
[4911.18 → 4912.48] take our
[4912.48 → 4912.96] dead
[4912.96 → 4914.32] orthodoxy,
[4914.40 → 4914.92] take our
[4914.92 → 4915.46] Christian
[4915.46 → 4916.46] moralism,
[4916.46 → 4917.48] and transform
[4917.48 → 4918.64] us by the
[4918.64 → 4919.36] power of the
[4919.36 → 4921.12] gospel into
[4921.12 → 4922.50] gospel
[4922.50 → 4923.86] Christians,
[4924.50 → 4926.84] transform us
[4926.84 → 4927.46] into the
[4927.46 → 4928.00] image of
[4928.00 → 4928.86] Jesus Christ
[4928.86 → 4930.04] by grace
[4930.04 → 4930.94] through faith,
[4931.82 → 4932.60] it's in his name
[4932.60 → 4933.08] that we pray,
[4933.64 → 4934.04] and all God's
[4934.04 → 4934.48] people said,
[4935.48 → 4935.72] amen.
[4935.72 → 4935.84] Amen.
[4942.40 → 4943.58] As we come to
[4943.58 → 4944.04] the table,
[4944.20 → 4944.52] we're going to
[4944.52 → 4945.04] move through a
[4945.04 → 4945.38] bit of a
[4945.38 → 4945.76] liturgy,
[4946.20 → 4946.56] and so I
[4946.56 → 4947.18] invite you
[4947.18 → 4948.12] to follow
[4948.12 → 4948.44] along,
[4948.52 → 4948.86] the words
[4948.86 → 4949.24] will be on
[4949.24 → 4949.70] the screen
[4949.70 → 4950.46] behind me
[4950.46 → 4951.24] and overhead,
[4952.08 → 4952.78] you speak the
[4952.78 → 4953.14] ones that
[4953.14 → 4953.68] appear there
[4953.68 → 4954.64] in yellow.
[4956.76 → 4957.66] Lift
[4957.66 → 4958.38] your hearts,
[4959.46 → 4962.24] let us give
[4962.24 → 4962.92] thanks to the
[4962.92 → 4963.32] Lord our
[4963.32 → 4963.60] God.
[4967.04 → 4967.76] Let us
[4967.76 → 4967.98] pray.
[4969.96 → 4971.04] With joy,
[4971.32 → 4972.04] we praise
[4972.04 → 4972.48] you,
[4972.70 → 4973.00] gracious
[4973.00 → 4973.86] God,
[4974.66 → 4975.08] for you
[4975.08 → 4975.84] have created
[4975.84 → 4976.62] heaven and
[4976.62 → 4977.16] earth and
[4977.16 → 4977.86] made us in
[4977.86 → 4978.34] your image
[4978.34 → 4979.30] and kept
[4979.30 → 4980.50] covenant with
[4980.50 → 4980.84] us,
[4980.92 → 4981.84] even when we
[4981.84 → 4982.58] fell into
[4982.58 → 4982.92] sin.
[4983.62 → 4984.16] We give
[4984.16 → 4984.72] you thank
[4984.72 → 4985.26] for Jesus
[4985.26 → 4985.76] Christ,
[4985.86 → 4986.38] who by
[4986.38 → 4987.08] his life,
[4987.56 → 4987.78] death,
[4987.92 → 4988.70] and resurrection
[4988.70 → 4989.90] opened to
[4989.90 → 4990.90] us the way
[4990.90 → 4991.86] of everlasting
[4991.86 → 4992.90] life.
[4993.88 → 4994.12] Amen.
[4997.04 → 4997.94] Lord Jesus,
[4998.48 → 4999.20] before he
[4999.20 → 4999.60] suffered,
[4999.86 → 5000.56] gave us
[5000.56 → 5001.52] this memorial
[5001.52 → 5002.26] of his
[5002.26 → 5002.90] sacrifice
[5002.90 → 5003.92] until he
[5003.92 → 5005.20] comes again.
[5006.28 → 5006.62] The Lord
[5006.62 → 5006.90] Jesus,
[5007.06 → 5007.54] on the night
[5007.54 → 5008.00] that he
[5008.00 → 5008.88] was betrayed,
[5009.14 → 5009.50] he took
[5009.50 → 5009.90] bread,
[5010.90 → 5011.86] and when he
[5011.86 → 5012.16] had given
[5012.16 → 5012.78] thanks,
[5013.02 → 5013.70] he broke
[5013.70 → 5013.98] it,
[5014.38 → 5014.86] and he
[5014.86 → 5015.06] said,
[5015.22 → 5015.84] this is
[5015.84 → 5016.58] my body,
[5016.76 → 5017.22] which is
[5017.22 → 5017.78] for you.
[5018.24 → 5018.90] Do this
[5018.90 → 5019.70] in remembrance
[5019.70 → 5020.82] of me.
[5020.82 → 5028.28] in the
[5028.28 → 5028.86] same way,
[5028.96 → 5029.32] he took
[5029.32 → 5029.78] the cup
[5029.78 → 5030.78] after supper,
[5030.96 → 5031.18] saying,
[5031.56 → 5032.18] this cup
[5032.18 → 5032.66] is the
[5032.66 → 5033.18] new covenant
[5033.18 → 5033.70] in my
[5033.70 → 5034.06] blood.
[5034.22 → 5034.86] Do this
[5034.86 → 5035.66] whenever you
[5035.66 → 5036.24] drink it
[5036.24 → 5037.18] in remembrance
[5037.18 → 5038.34] of me.
[5038.34 → 5040.38] Amen.
[5050.82 → 5053.74] for whenever
[5053.74 → 5054.56] you eat
[5054.56 → 5055.20] this bread
[5055.20 → 5056.04] and drink
[5056.04 → 5057.08] this cup,
[5057.20 → 5057.96] you proclaim
[5057.96 → 5058.58] the Lord's
[5058.58 → 5059.74] death until
[5059.74 → 5060.78] he comes
[5060.78 → 5061.44] again.
[5061.44 → 5064.58] this is
[5064.58 → 5065.40] the mystery
[5065.40 → 5066.38] of our
[5066.38 → 5066.68] faith.
[5080.68 → 5081.70] Church family,
[5082.22 → 5082.78] the Lord
[5082.78 → 5083.90] has prepared
[5083.90 → 5084.74] his table
[5084.74 → 5085.60] for all
[5085.60 → 5086.50] who love
[5086.50 → 5087.48] him and
[5087.48 → 5088.22] trust in
[5088.22 → 5089.18] him alone
[5089.18 → 5089.94] for their
[5089.94 → 5090.72] salvation,
[5090.72 → 5091.28] and so,
[5091.48 → 5092.00] come to
[5092.00 → 5092.80] this table,
[5093.24 → 5093.64] you who
[5093.64 → 5094.40] have much

[5976.88 → 5981.94] I was so lost, I should have died,
[5981.94 → 5986.94] but you have brought me to your side
[5986.94 → 5991.94] to be led by your staff and rod
[5991.94 → 5996.94] and to be called the Lamb of God.
[5996.94 → 6002.00] O Lamb of God, sweet Lamb of God,
