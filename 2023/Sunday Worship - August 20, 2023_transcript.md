[672.00 --> 673.26]  First of all, my name is Kevin Lowebert.
[673.28 --> 674.42]  I'm the youth pastor here.
[675.28 --> 679.14]  I have been the only pastor here this week because everybody left me on vacation.
[679.84 --> 681.86]  So isn't it so sad?
[682.40 --> 683.34]  No, they're having a good time.
[683.40 --> 684.10]  They all deserve it.
[684.16 --> 686.44]  So it's been good to be here this week.
[687.06 --> 689.80]  A couple of announcements for you this morning.
[689.94 --> 694.50]  On September the 3rd, that's the long weekend, the Sunday of the long weekend, Labor Day long weekend,
[694.82 --> 696.60]  we are having a baseball event.
[696.60 --> 699.08]  So our church has a softball team called the Isotopes.
[699.08 --> 703.34]  We are inviting the rest of your church to come out and try to beat the Isotopes.
[703.56 --> 707.34]  So we will likely be meeting at Topham Park Sunday after church.
[707.34 --> 709.40]  We'll do a little potluck lunch thing.
[709.48 --> 710.62]  There's parks for kids.
[711.06 --> 712.06]  Bring anybody interested.
[712.18 --> 714.90]  We'll have a good time and come out and see if you can beat the Isotopes.
[715.58 --> 719.42]  As well, the following weekend, we've got a big weekend happening here at this church.
[719.76 --> 721.20]  Reactivate is going to be hosted here.
[721.46 --> 722.46]  That is a youth conference.
[722.46 --> 728.18]  There will be 200-plus youth and leaders from all across BC swarming into this place.
[728.18 --> 729.70]  It's going to be an awesome weekend.
[730.16 --> 733.18]  But we are looking for a handful of volunteers to help out with that.
[733.30 --> 735.78]  So that has been in the bulletin recently.
[735.98 --> 742.84]  If you are able to help out with food prep or food cleanup or setup or teardown or set adjustments
[742.84 --> 747.88]  as we move chairs and tables around throughout the weekend, please take a look at that sign-up sheet.
[748.38 --> 749.18]  We need...
[749.90 --> 752.78]  It's in the hundreds of volunteers for that.
[752.78 --> 757.22]  So if you can help out in that way, this is not the only church we're inviting,
[757.34 --> 760.34]  but this church has shown up in droves over the past few years.
[760.40 --> 762.08]  So please take a look at that list.
[762.12 --> 765.40]  And if you can help volunteer that weekend, that would be greatly appreciated.
[765.96 --> 769.00]  Please rise as we hear God's greeting for us this morning.
[769.00 --> 775.86]  God's greeting this morning comes from Revelation.
[776.48 --> 781.36]  Grace and peace to you from him who is and who was and who is to come,
[781.62 --> 784.44]  and from the seven spirits that are before his throne,
[784.68 --> 787.94]  and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness,
[788.48 --> 792.66]  the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth.
[793.12 --> 795.12]  And all God's people said, amen.
[795.12 --> 797.96]  Please take this moment to greet those around you.
[797.96 --> 798.46]  Amen.
[825.12 --> 836.12]  Good morning.
[836.44 --> 841.38]  Our call to worship this morning is coming to us from Psalm 117 and 118.
[842.32 --> 843.06]  And it says,
[843.46 --> 845.04]  Praise the Lord, all you nations.
[845.30 --> 847.32]  Extol him, all you peoples.
[848.20 --> 850.48]  For great is his love toward us,
[850.54 --> 853.20]  and the faithfulness of the Lord endures forever.
[854.00 --> 854.84]  Praise the Lord.
[855.88 --> 858.08]  Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good.
[858.60 --> 860.02]  His love endures forever.
[860.02 --> 860.42]  Amen.
[885.12 --> 893.08]  In my wrestling and in my doubts,
[893.08 --> 897.20]  In my failures, won't walk out.
[897.20 --> 901.36]  Your great love will lead me through.
[901.88 --> 905.56]  You are peace in my troubled sea.
[905.56 --> 909.82]  Oh, you are peace in my troubled sea.
[909.82 --> 921.72]  Oh, you are peace in my troubled sea.
[921.72 --> 922.72]  My light out.

[939.12 --> 940.12]  My light out.

[947.88 --> 949.58]  My light out.
[950.08 --> 951.60]  I will trust the promise.

[961.08 --> 963.40]  Straight to shore.
[963.40 --> 964.22]  Straight to shore.
[964.22 --> 968.30]  Straight to shore.
[968.30 --> 968.92]  Straight to shore.
[970.36 --> 975.08]  I won't fear what tomorrow brings.
[975.48 --> 979.14]  With each morning I'll rise and sing.
[979.64 --> 983.38]  My God's love will lead me through.
[983.38 --> 987.54]  You are peace in my troubled sea.
[987.54 --> 991.96]  Oh, you are peace in my troubled sea.
[994.96 --> 996.88]  My light out.
[997.38 --> 998.96]  My light out.
[999.34 --> 1001.02]  Shining in the darkness.
[1001.58 --> 1003.64]  I will call you all.
[1003.78 --> 1005.26]  My light out.
[1005.80 --> 1007.34]  My light out.
[1007.84 --> 1009.38]  I will trust the promise.
[1009.38 --> 1013.20]  You will carry me straight to shore.
[1015.00 --> 1017.34]  Straight to shore.
[1019.20 --> 1021.20]  Straight to shore.
[1023.34 --> 1025.36]  Straight to shore.
[1028.74 --> 1030.70]  Fire before us.
[1030.92 --> 1032.72]  You're the brightest.
[1033.24 --> 1036.38]  You will lead us through the storm.
[1037.12 --> 1039.14]  Fire before us.
[1039.26 --> 1041.12]  You're the brightest.
[1041.26 --> 1045.40]  You will lead us through the storm.
[1054.12 --> 1055.94]  Fire before us.
[1056.08 --> 1057.56]  You're the brightest.
[1058.38 --> 1062.32]  You will lead us through the storm.
[1062.32 --> 1068.96]  My lighthouse, my lighthouse
[1068.96 --> 1073.58]  Shining in darkness, I will follow you all
[1073.58 --> 1077.40]  My lighthouse, my lighthouse
[1077.40 --> 1079.72]  I will trust upon us
[1079.72 --> 1082.56]  You will carry me safe to show
[1082.56 --> 1086.84]  Safe to show
[1086.84 --> 1091.52]  Safe to show
[1091.52 --> 1095.84]  Safe to show
[1095.84 --> 1125.84] 
[1125.84 --> 1130.16]  You are the source of heaven
[1130.16 --> 1134.48]  Come on earth
[1134.48 --> 1138.48]  Jesus, light in the darkness
[1138.48 --> 1142.48]  Jesus, truth in circumstance
[1142.48 --> 1146.80]  You are the source of heaven
[1146.80 --> 1149.12]  You are the source of heaven
[1149.12 --> 1151.12]  You are the source of heaven
[1151.12 --> 1156.98]  You live and die, you broke the chains, you broke to life.
[1158.46 --> 1161.84]  You are the hope living in us.
[1161.84 --> 1165.82]  You are the rock in whom we trust.
[1166.34 --> 1172.22]  You are the light shining for all the world to see.
[1173.66 --> 1177.52]  You rose from the dead, conquering fear.
[1177.52 --> 1181.46]  Our prince of peace, dry and a seer.
[1181.78 --> 1187.36]  Jesus, I hope living for all who will receive.
[1189.00 --> 1191.16]  Lord, we believe.
[1198.54 --> 1201.84]  Jesus, hope of the nations.
[1202.88 --> 1207.50]  Jesus, comfort for all who mourn.
[1207.52 --> 1212.64]  You are the source of hell and hope on earth.
[1214.54 --> 1217.40]  Jesus, light in the darkness.
[1218.50 --> 1221.78]  Jesus, truth in each circumstance.
[1223.36 --> 1228.46]  You are the source of hell and hope on earth.
[1228.46 --> 1232.84]  In history, you live and die.
[1232.84 --> 1236.84]  You broke the chains, you broke to life.
[1238.34 --> 1241.82]  You are the hope living in us.
[1242.20 --> 1245.58]  You are the rock in whom we trust.
[1245.58 --> 1251.70]  You are the light shining for all the world to see.
[1251.70 --> 1257.18]  You rock shall not dare, conquer with fear.
[1257.18 --> 1261.06]  Our heads of peace, dry and a seer.
[1261.06 --> 1266.44]  Jesus, our hope living for all who will receive.
[1266.44 --> 1270.44]  Lord, we believe.
[1270.44 --> 1274.82]  Lord, we believe.
[1274.82 --> 1278.32]  Lord, we believe.
[1278.32 --> 1278.66]  Lord, we believe.
[1278.66 --> 1283.48]  And by you to be easy.
[1283.54 --> 1283.94]  Amen.
[1285.98 --> 1295.54]  We were looking this summer at stories of faith from Hebrews 11.
[1295.54 --> 1298.12]  and so I thought I would start off with that.
[1298.44 --> 1301.08]  Now faith is confidence in what we hope for
[1301.08 --> 1303.62]  and assurance about what we do not see.
[1304.40 --> 1307.04]  This is what the ancients were commended for.
[1307.74 --> 1310.68]  This summer as we were looking through the heroes of faith,
[1311.22 --> 1315.26]  I found myself asking what my story of faith looks like
[1315.26 --> 1318.96]  or even what your story of faith looks like.
[1320.50 --> 1323.38]  I think every one of us has a story of faith
[1323.38 --> 1327.76]  and I don't think it needs to be as remarkable as Moses or Joseph.
[1332.84 --> 1336.26]  You don't think I would get emotional on just something as easy as this.
[1340.52 --> 1345.06]  We do need to share our stories with each other,
[1345.30 --> 1347.64]  not just to encourage each other,
[1347.64 --> 1355.20]  but to give God the glory for his faithfulness and his goodness in our lives.
[1357.50 --> 1359.04]  So why don't we just bow our heads.
[1362.74 --> 1367.60]  Father, you lovingly hold each one of us in your hands
[1367.60 --> 1374.18]  and yet we don't always recognize your place in our lives.
[1375.40 --> 1378.66]  Forgive us for being blind to the care that you give us,
[1379.08 --> 1381.36]  for not recognizing your hand as you guide us.
[1382.52 --> 1387.60]  Will you open up our eyes to your faithfulness and your unfailing love?
[1388.58 --> 1392.62]  You have guided the cloud of witnesses that have gone before us
[1392.62 --> 1395.44]  and our lives are full of your stories.
[1397.64 --> 1401.92]  Give us boldness to share your goodness in our lives with others
[1401.92 --> 1405.20]  as we rest in your amazing grace.
[1405.86 --> 1406.96]  And we ask this in your name.
[1407.16 --> 1407.38]  Amen.
[1410.26 --> 1412.46]  We all rise as we sing this next one.
[1412.46 --> 1431.06]  Who breaks a flower, a sin in darkness,
[1431.64 --> 1435.34]  whose love is mighty and so much stronger,
[1435.98 --> 1439.98]  the King of glory, the King of the Lord King.
[1439.98 --> 1440.98]  Amen.
[1440.98 --> 1441.98]  Amen.
[1442.46 --> 1444.96]  Amen.
[1460.52 --> 1460.58]  Amen.
[1462.14 --> 1462.42]  Amen.
[1462.94 --> 1463.86]  Amen.
[1463.86 --> 1464.22]  Amen.
[1465.04 --> 1465.26]  Amen.
[1465.28 --> 1465.44]  Amen.
[1467.48 --> 1468.00]  Amen.
[1470.80 --> 1471.70]  Amen.
[1471.70 --> 1471.90]  Amen.
[1471.90 --> 1472.12]  Amen.
[1472.46 --> 1482.52]  bear my cross, that you lay down your mind, that I would be set free.
[1485.10 --> 1490.86]  Oh, Jesus, I sing for all that you've done for me.
[1490.86 --> 1520.84]  Oh, Jesus, I sing for all that you've done for me.
[1520.86 --> 1525.34]  The King above all kings.
[1525.64 --> 1528.50]  This is amazing grace.
[1529.76 --> 1533.28]  This is unfailing love.
[1533.86 --> 1536.86]  That you would take my place.
[1538.00 --> 1540.74]  That you would bear my cross.
[1542.42 --> 1548.74]  You lay down your mind, that I would be set free.
[1550.86 --> 1557.34]  Oh, Jesus, I sing for all that you've done for me.
[1557.34 --> 1563.34]  Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
[1564.12 --> 1567.34]  Worthy is the King who conquered the grave.
[1567.34 --> 1571.74]  Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
[1571.82 --> 1576.12]  Worthy is the King who conquered the grave.
[1576.12 --> 1584.12]  Worthy is the Lamb who was slain Worthy is the King who conquered the grave
[1584.12 --> 1594.12]  Worthy is the Lamb who was slain Worthy, worthy of this is amazing grace
[1594.12 --> 1607.12]  This is unfailing love That You would take my place That You would bear my cross
[1607.12 --> 1616.12]  If You laid down Your life That I would be set free
[1616.12 --> 1623.12]  Oh, Jesus, I'd sing for All that You've done for me
[1646.12 --> 1665.12]  My Jesus, I love Thee I know Thou art mine
[1665.12 --> 1675.12]  For Thee all the fallings Of sin I design
[1675.12 --> 1686.12]  My gracious Redeemer My Savior art Thou
[1686.12 --> 1696.12]  If ever I love Thee My Jesus is Thou
[1696.12 --> 1709.12]  I love Thee because Thou hast first loved me
[1709.12 --> 1719.12]  And purchase My pardon On Calvary's tree
[1719.12 --> 1730.12]  I love Thee for wearing The thorns on Thy brow
[1730.12 --> 1740.12]  If ever I love Thee My Jesus is Thou
[1740.12 --> 1754.12]  I love Thee in Thou I will love Thee in death
[1754.12 --> 1765.12]  And praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath
[1765.12 --> 1776.12]  And say when the death do Thou's cold on my brow
[1776.12 --> 1778.12]  If ever I love Thee in death
[1778.12 --> 1787.12]  If ever I love Thee my Jesus is Thou
[1787.12 --> 1790.12]  And that sheds of glory And endless divine
[1790.12 --> 1801.12]  I'll ever adore Thee in heaven so bright
[1801.12 --> 1807.12]  I'll sing with the glittering crown On my brow
[1807.12 --> 1808.12]  If ever I love Thee in heaven so bright
[1808.12 --> 1820.12]  I'll sing with the glittering crown On my brow
[1820.12 --> 1822.12]  If ever I love Thee my Jesus is Thou
[1822.12 --> 1824.12]  If ever I love Thee my Jesus is Thou
[1824.12 --> 1838.12]  May I have a seat
[1838.12 --> 1845.12]  I'll sing with the glory
[1845.12 --> 1859.12]  Good morning
[1859.12 --> 1860.12]  Today's special offering is for the collective
[1860.12 --> 1866.12]  Our offering today is an opportunity to support the ministry of those who serve in the church here
[1866.12 --> 1872.12]  We are blessed to be able to meet here and in the church
[1872.12 --> 1877.12]  And in the church we are able to be blessed and a blessing to those around us
[1877.12 --> 1881.12]  We have a wide variety of programs that encompass the youngest to oldest
[1881.12 --> 1885.12]  And all who come to our doors are the church joining us
[1885.12 --> 1887.12]  Thank you

[1931.88 --> 1941.88]  You are here, working in this place. I worship you.
[1943.12 --> 1954.88]  I worship you. You are here, moving in a mix. I worship you.
[1954.88 --> 1967.64]  I worship you. You are here, working in this place. I worship you.
[1967.64 --> 1979.64]  I worship you. You are a way maker, miracle worker, promise keeper, light in the darkness.
[1979.64 --> 1993.14]  My God, that is who you are. You are a way maker, miracle worker, promise keeper, light in the darkness.
[1993.64 --> 2003.64]  My God, that is who you are. You are here, touching every heart.
[2003.64 --> 2016.64]  I worship you. I worship you. You are here, turning eyes around.
[2016.64 --> 2029.64]  I worship you. I worship you. You are here, turning eyes around.
[2029.64 --> 2048.64]  I worship you. I worship you. You are here, bending every heart. I worship you. I worship you.
[2048.64 --> 2068.64]  I worship you. You are here, taking every heart. I worship you. You are a way maker, miracle worker, promise keeper,
[2068.64 --> 2071.84]  I'm in the darkness, my God.
[2071.84 --> 2074.84]  That is who you are.
[2098.64 --> 2128.62]  Even when I don't feel that you're working, you never stop, you never stop working.
[2128.64 --> 2143.68]  y
[2147.76 --> 2155.68]  my god
[2158.64 --> 2174.64]  That is who you are
[2174.64 --> 2178.64]  That is who you are
[2178.64 --> 2191.56]  I would love to invite all of the kids forward, ages 3 to kindergarten.
[2191.84 --> 2194.26]  Great job. You guys can come up front right now.
[2194.64 --> 2198.86]  We're going to do a little prayer, and then it'll be time for children's worship time.
[2202.04 --> 2204.32]  All right, here comes a couple more.
[2206.80 --> 2208.24]  How has summer been so far?
[2208.64 --> 2208.84]  Good.
[2209.00 --> 2210.62]  Yeah, good. You've had lots of fun.
[2211.08 --> 2212.02]  Have you been outside a lot?
[2213.02 --> 2215.02]  Yeah, yeah. That's good.
[2215.44 --> 2218.82]  That's good. Okay, we're going to pray, and then we're going to go to children's worship time. Deal?
[2219.50 --> 2221.28]  Yeah, okay. Let's fold our hands, close our eyes.
[2221.62 --> 2224.80]  Father God, thank you that we could come to church today and that we could learn more about you.
[2225.06 --> 2228.66]  We pray as we go to children's worship time and as the adults stay behind, God,
[2228.66 --> 2233.50]  that we will be able to really learn what it means to follow you and what it means to have faith in you.
[2233.68 --> 2235.62]  We pray this in your name. Amen.
[2235.62 --> 2239.72]  Okay, we're going to stand up, and then we're going to do the children's blessing, okay?
[2240.06 --> 2242.86]  So we're going to do it really, really loud. Can we do it really loud?
[2243.50 --> 2246.00]  Yeah, so we're going to say, the Lord be with you at the same time. Are you ready?
[2246.54 --> 2246.76]  Okay.
[2247.28 --> 2248.38]  One, two, three.
[2248.38 --> 2250.92]  The Lord be with you.
[2251.24 --> 2252.82]  And also with you.
[2252.90 --> 2253.96]  All right, good job.
[2269.84 --> 2274.32]  Good morning, everyone. I'm Steve Rikike, an elder here.
[2274.32 --> 2277.80]  It's the first time I'm going to be leading you in a family prayer, so here we go.
[2280.94 --> 2286.04]  Father God, Lord of Lords, King of Kings, you rule over all.
[2286.74 --> 2289.56]  We, your people, come before you to acknowledge you are the creator.
[2289.92 --> 2294.28]  You spoke our world into being, a world that speaks out of your majesty and power,
[2294.72 --> 2298.02]  a world that we often do not understand, a world we wrestle with,
[2298.38 --> 2300.88]  but we still take great comfort in knowing you are in control.
[2300.88 --> 2304.30]  Lord, you give us the pleasure of experiencing the rhythms of life,
[2304.44 --> 2307.02]  the rising and setting of the sun, the changing of the season,
[2307.22 --> 2308.28]  each with its own character.
[2308.92 --> 2313.08]  Summer with beauty of gardens and flowers and grandeur of forests and mountain peaks,
[2313.52 --> 2317.52]  and both the peacefulness and the power of oceans and rivers and lakes and streams.
[2318.06 --> 2320.72]  But Lord, even in summer, a period of rest,
[2320.94 --> 2324.78]  help us to continue to see the many needs in our world and communities.
[2324.78 --> 2328.62]  We think of poverty, poverty, homelessness, refugees,
[2329.34 --> 2332.30]  and especially now the ever-growing impact of climate change.
[2332.82 --> 2337.02]  Open our eyes to see the beauty and the needs around us and give us the desire to act.
[2337.70 --> 2341.32]  Lord, we confess that we are often blind to all that you offer and provide for us.
[2341.56 --> 2344.34]  We become focused and obsessed with ourselves, our own problems,
[2344.50 --> 2346.12]  our own perceived needs and desires,
[2346.26 --> 2350.24]  and we close the eyes to the beauty and creation and those needs around us.
[2350.24 --> 2353.08]  The needs in the world we live in,
[2353.30 --> 2355.58]  needs of our own country and our province and our community.
[2356.40 --> 2360.82]  We confess that we really have no excuse not to reach out to feed those who are hungry,
[2361.02 --> 2366.00]  clothe the poor, and to visit those in need and treat them as equals as they are in your sight.
[2366.68 --> 2372.82]  Father, forgive us and use your spirit to prompt and move each of us to do our own part.
[2374.82 --> 2378.56]  Thank you, Lord, for reminding us that you are in control and that you are always there.
[2378.56 --> 2380.96]  Where can we go from your spirit?
[2381.62 --> 2383.92]  Lord, you are in the heavens, you are in the depths,
[2384.12 --> 2386.16]  you are everywhere in every corner of our lives,
[2386.28 --> 2388.46]  and your hand will guide us and hold us fast.
[2389.52 --> 2393.38]  Father, we pray for our world, our nation, our province and communities.
[2394.68 --> 2397.96]  This time we especially pray for the many thousands of people
[2397.96 --> 2402.52]  who are greatly impacted by wildfires around the world and very locally,
[2402.52 --> 2405.58]  especially those who have lost loved ones,
[2405.58 --> 2410.50]  thinking of the firefighters and those in Hawaii that have lost their lives.
[2410.60 --> 2413.54]  We pray for the many families that have lost their homes
[2413.54 --> 2417.16]  and now will face the very difficult task of building a new one
[2417.16 --> 2420.02]  and rebuilding their lives.
[2420.36 --> 2422.96]  We pray for the firefighters and the first responders
[2422.96 --> 2426.52]  who are working very long hours in extreme conditions to control these fires,
[2426.52 --> 2429.78]  and we pray for RAIN to help control them.
[2430.52 --> 2432.94]  We bring all the leaders who govern before you.
[2433.16 --> 2435.50]  We pray that you will bless them and guide them in the difficult,
[2435.98 --> 2440.10]  stressful and often very thankless task of setting direction
[2440.10 --> 2443.88]  and working towards solutions of the many challenges we face.
[2444.82 --> 2447.54]  We pray for the refugees who have been forced to leave their homes
[2447.54 --> 2451.44]  and start new lives in other countries, including here in Canada.
[2451.44 --> 2454.82]  We thank you for the many people who work tirelessly to assist
[2454.82 --> 2456.50]  in the new integration process.
[2457.30 --> 2460.28]  Lord, we pray for brokenness that we see in the world around us.
[2462.42 --> 2466.98]  We also bring our needs of this church, our concerns and our joys before you.
[2467.38 --> 2471.12]  We pray for those in our church body who struggle with their health,
[2471.22 --> 2472.24]  both mental and physical.
[2472.54 --> 2473.98]  We pray for strength and comfort.
[2474.26 --> 2476.54]  We pray for those that have lost family and friends.
[2476.54 --> 2481.64]  Lord, comfort them all and send a special measure of your healing grace.
[2482.36 --> 2487.54]  We pray for John Kuypers who is experiencing pain due to his treatment he has received,
[2487.62 --> 2490.96]  and we pray for that situation.
[2491.16 --> 2495.06]  We pray for Amy Cron who has been in the hospital for the last number of weeks
[2495.06 --> 2497.22]  receiving treatment for her lung cancer.
[2497.38 --> 2500.96]  We understand the cancer has advanced more quickly than expected,
[2501.08 --> 2502.32]  and we don't know what's next.
[2502.46 --> 2505.42]  We pray for her and her family in this very difficult time.
[2505.42 --> 2511.56]  We also are thankful that Amy Bongers had her second eye surgery
[2511.56 --> 2515.54]  and is doing much better this time, and we pray for her continued healing.
[2516.50 --> 2520.08]  We pray for all those that suffer in silence,
[2520.16 --> 2523.20]  and we bring them a measure of joy or healing power.
[2523.80 --> 2527.94]  We congratulate Jared and Kristen Berndt as they got married yesterday.
[2528.20 --> 2531.58]  May God bless them as they start their married life together.
[2531.58 --> 2535.80]  And we pray and thank you for the celebration of birthdays, anniversaries, and milestones,
[2536.14 --> 2538.58]  and many simple summer get-togethers.
[2539.54 --> 2542.04]  Lord, help us to remember you are always there for us,
[2542.50 --> 2544.08]  and that you call us to follow your teaching,
[2544.24 --> 2547.58]  to live in fellowship and communion with you and with one another.
[2547.80 --> 2551.22]  And we pray all these things continually.
[2552.00 --> 2555.14]  We be with Pastor Kevin as he leads us this morning.
[2555.14 --> 2560.76]  We thank you for his willingness to share his gifts, talents, and insights with us here at Emmanuel,
[2560.90 --> 2563.02]  and we ask you bless him and his message this morning.
[2563.70 --> 2567.76]  We pray all this in the name of Jesus Christ, your Son, and our Lord and Savior.
[2568.10 --> 2568.30]  Amen.
[2568.30 --> 2568.40]  Amen.
[2568.40 --> 2568.44]  Amen.
[2568.44 --> 2568.50]  Amen.
[2568.50 --> 2570.50]  Amen.
[2570.50 --> 2572.50]  Amen.
[2572.50 --> 2574.50]  Amen.
[2574.50 --> 2574.88]  Amen.
[2574.88 --> 2575.50]  Amen.
[2575.50 --> 2576.50]  Amen.
[2576.50 --> 2577.50]  Amen.
[2577.50 --> 2578.50]  Amen.
[2578.50 --> 2579.50]  Amen.
[2579.50 --> 2580.50]  Amen.
[2580.50 --> 2581.50]  Amen.
[2581.50 --> 2581.54]  Amen.
[2581.54 --> 2581.60]  Amen.
[2581.60 --> 2582.54]  Amen.
[2582.54 --> 2583.54]  Amen.
[2583.54 --> 2583.66]  Amen.
[2583.66 --> 2583.68]  Amen.
[2583.68 --> 2583.76]  Amen.
[2583.76 --> 2584.70]  Amen.
[2584.70 --> 2585.12]  Amen.
[2585.14 --> 2608.24]  Amen.
[2608.24 --> 2610.48]  Amen.
[2611.04 --> 2615.12]  Amen.
[2615.12 --> 2620.86]  in fear because of you. We have heard how the Lord dried up the waters of the Red Sea for you
[2620.86 --> 2626.78]  when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to Sion and Og, the two kings of the Amorites,
[2626.98 --> 2635.62]  east of Jordan, whom you completely destroyed. When we heard of it, our hearts melted in fear,
[2635.72 --> 2642.04]  and everyone's courage failed because of you. For the Lord your God is God in heaven above
[2642.04 --> 2643.66]  and on earth below.
[2655.82 --> 2665.02]  Thank you, Amara and Shanae. You did such a good job. That was our text this morning, Hebrews 11,
[2665.02 --> 2671.12]  verse 31, and then Joshua 2, 8 to 11. And so if you want to follow along a little bit,
[2671.12 --> 2677.30]  you can turn to Joshua 2 especially, and then look at verses 8 and 11 as we go through this
[2677.30 --> 2683.60]  message today. Now as we continue our sermon series on heroes of faith, our hero today, as we just heard,
[2683.70 --> 2691.56]  is Rahab. Rahab is the only female hero mentioned in Hebrews 11. Now of course, there are many faith
[2691.56 --> 2697.74]  heroes who are female in the Bible, ones who actually would perhaps look on much more favorably
[2697.74 --> 2705.12]  than Rahab and Rahab's life. Heroes like Mary, who trusted in God that she would deliver his son
[2705.12 --> 2711.34]  while she was still a virgin, or Esther, who stood up to the king of Persia, risking her own life to save
[2711.34 --> 2718.52]  her people, or Jael, who faithfully drove a tent peg into some dude's head. That happens in Judges 4,
[2718.52 --> 2724.40]  and she was credited with great faith. But the author of Hebrews doesn't pick any of them.
[2725.78 --> 2732.54]  Not that they weren't deserving, no. He picks Rahab, though. He picks a prostitute from a pagan country
[2732.54 --> 2739.86]  who has no ties to the Israelite people, except that she had heard who God was and feared for her life.
[2739.86 --> 2746.94]  And I believe that it is exactly that reason that Rahab is mentioned in this text of Hebrews 11
[2746.94 --> 2753.00]  over and above other women throughout the Bible. First, let's take a quick look then of Rahab's
[2753.00 --> 2759.42]  story, and all of this can be found in Joshua chapter 2. So in Joshua chapter 2, that whole chapter
[2759.42 --> 2766.00]  is Rahab's story. Joshua sends in two spies to check on the city of Jericho before they cross the river
[2766.00 --> 2771.38]  and into the promised land, because he wants to know what they're up against when they enter the
[2771.38 --> 2776.26]  promised land. We don't know what the spies' mission was or how it went, but it seems that they were not
[2776.26 --> 2781.36]  very good at their job, because all we hear about is that they instantly need to hide from a king who
[2781.36 --> 2787.60]  found them relatively quickly. So Rahab, hearing much about what God had been doing for the Israelite
[2787.60 --> 2793.56]  people, hides the spies on the roof of her house, and hides them under some flaxseed, showing that
[2793.56 --> 2799.30]  flaxseed actually does have some promise and good into this world. Now Rahab then tricks the king.
[2799.38 --> 2802.72]  The king comes in, and the guards show up, and she tricks the king. Actually, she just straight up
[2802.72 --> 2809.82]  lies to the king, which we know is bad, though also lying about people hiding has been looked on
[2809.82 --> 2815.20]  throughout history as much less bad and frowned upon much less than trying to kill the people whom you
[2815.20 --> 2820.42]  are hiding, right? We've known that throughout history as well. So she lies, but she does to save
[2820.42 --> 2826.14]  these people. Anyway, she tricks the guards. She sends them on this wild goose chase. Once the coast
[2826.14 --> 2832.48]  is clear then, she goes back to the spies, tells them that she saved them, and pleads with them to
[2832.48 --> 2839.02]  remember her and her family when the Israelite army comes back. The spies agree then, and they tell her
[2839.02 --> 2844.52]  to hang a red cord out of her window so that they can recognize her house, and that when the time comes,
[2844.52 --> 2852.04]  anyone who is inside that house will be saved. Then a few chapters later in Joshua 6, 25, we read that
[2852.04 --> 2857.00]  Rahab and her family and all that were in her house were in fact saved and spared from the destruction
[2857.00 --> 2862.98]  that the Israelites came when they defeated Jericho. So that's Rahab's story. That's what she did, and that
[2862.98 --> 2869.88]  shows the faith that she had. But let's hear what Hebrews says. Hebrews 11, verse 1. Before we hear of all of
[2869.88 --> 2876.80]  these heroes of faith, we are told what faith is. We are taught, and Pete actually read it this morning,
[2876.88 --> 2883.82]  we are taught that faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.
[2884.48 --> 2891.08]  That means we are able to look forward to our salvation, which is assured, because we are confident
[2891.08 --> 2898.76]  we know what Christ had done for us. We are confident in what we hope for and assured about what we do not see.
[2899.88 --> 2909.58]  That is Rahab's story. In our text today, she cries out to the spies in verse 10. We have heard
[2909.58 --> 2915.10]  how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did
[2915.10 --> 2923.02]  to Sihon and Og, the two kings of the Amorites east of the Georgian. We have heard, not we have seen.
[2923.02 --> 2931.28]  More than that, due to what she had heard about God, about what he was doing with the Israelites,
[2931.80 --> 2938.82]  she was confident of what was to come. In verse 9, she says, I know that the Lord has given you this
[2938.82 --> 2948.92]  land. Rahab was looking ahead to her only hope, these spies and this God of Israel, because she was
[2948.92 --> 2955.80]  confident. She believed in what she heard that God had done. She was confident in what she hoped for,
[2956.16 --> 2961.26]  salvation through the God of the Israelites, and assured of what she could not see, that the God
[2961.26 --> 2968.62]  of Israel was coming for Jericho and was going to give them the land. Rahab heard what God was doing
[2968.62 --> 2977.44]  and by her faith recognized him. That's our calling too. That's what we should take away today. That's
[2977.44 --> 2983.80]  the big idea, that through faith, those who see how God has moved, how he has exercised his sovereignty
[2983.80 --> 2991.96]  throughout history, those who see that, those who hear that, will recognize him as the only God worth
[2991.96 --> 2997.84]  serving. Or in short, faith is recognizing the one true God.
[3001.32 --> 3007.66]  That's why Rahab made it on this list. That's why she is called one of these faith heroes in Hebrews 11.
[3007.78 --> 3014.38]  By faith, she recognized God, not by seeing him or by growing up, learning about him, or by compiling
[3014.38 --> 3020.86]  all the data that she possibly could collect. She heard and then she recognized.
[3021.96 --> 3029.38]  Rahab, the Gentile, with no ties to the Israelite family or the Israelite history. Rahab, the prostitute,
[3029.68 --> 3035.22]  making her living in a way that goes against the way that God's law dictates. Rahab, the liar.
[3035.80 --> 3041.70]  She didn't bat an eye at deceiving the king. She was quite good at it to boot. Rahab, the pagan,
[3042.24 --> 3045.34]  living in a land with people just steeped in sin.
[3045.34 --> 3054.18]  But Rahab's story is not about sin. It's about salvation. Her sins are not dwelled on in this
[3054.18 --> 3060.82]  story, but her faith is well documented. Her past sins don't condemn her. Her actions,
[3060.98 --> 3068.44]  saving the spies, don't even save her. No, it's her faith that saves her. It's her faith that allows
[3068.44 --> 3074.68]  her to recognize God. It's her faith that motivates her to save the spies. It's her faith that pleads
[3074.68 --> 3080.12]  with the spies to save her and her family when God's coming to town. It's her faith that the book
[3080.12 --> 3089.26]  of Hebrews roots her salvation in. The point is that an immoral pagan woman would never have been
[3089.26 --> 3094.94]  considered a candidate for God's rescuing grace in the midst of the judgment that he was about to
[3094.94 --> 3103.82]  inflict on her city. And yet she and her family are the only ones shown God's compassion and mercy
[3103.82 --> 3113.58]  in response to her faith. Again, Rahab heard what God had done and believed in him and his sovereignty.
[3113.58 --> 3122.50]  And as Jesus said to Thomas in John 20, verse 29, blessed are those who believe but do not see.
[3124.94 --> 3131.98]  Rahab had faith, had faith in the God of Israel, faith that he was God and that he brought the
[3131.98 --> 3139.72]  Israelites out of the land of slavery. Actually, it's interesting then, if you compare Rahab to the
[3139.72 --> 3149.30]  rest of the Israelites, it's fascinating. God had to remind the Israelites so many times that he was the
[3149.30 --> 3155.28]  Lord God who had brought them out of Egypt. The line, I am the Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt
[3155.28 --> 3162.78]  shows up 11 times throughout the Exodus story alone. It's also rephrased a bunch more and appears in the
[3162.78 --> 3170.56]  Old Testament tons more times as well. God's people constantly lacked faith that God was going to deliver
[3170.56 --> 3177.96]  on his promises. The Israelites were constantly in needing of a reminder of who God was and what he had
[3177.96 --> 3185.48]  done. And they lived it. They saw it. They saw what God had done. They experienced what God had done.
[3186.04 --> 3195.52]  Rahab, though, through faith, recognized him without needing to see. She had only heard. She heard what God
[3195.52 --> 3200.00]  had done throughout history and knew that salvation came from him.
[3200.00 --> 3212.02]  That is another reason why Christianity is so compelling. Christianity is the most falsifiable
[3212.02 --> 3219.20]  religion in the world because it's rooted in history. As Michael Payton, pastor and Christian
[3219.20 --> 3225.02]  author, he points out, he says this. He says, the central claims of the Bible demand historic inquiry
[3225.02 --> 3231.64]  as they are based on public events that can be historically verified. In contrast, the central
[3231.64 --> 3238.44]  claims of all other religions cannot be historically tested and therefore are beyond falsifiability
[3238.44 --> 3245.42]  or inquiry. Now, Payton's not wrong. He goes on to highlight that the Muslim has to trust in a private
[3245.42 --> 3250.70]  encounter that Muhammad had, which cannot be tested historically. The Mormon has no way to truly
[3250.70 --> 3256.38]  investigate the claims of Joseph Smith. Religions like Buddhism and Hinduism, they aren't historic
[3256.38 --> 3262.08]  faiths either. They don't have central claims of events which believers can call upon and investigate.
[3262.62 --> 3267.24]  You either believe it or you don't. If you pick any other religion or worldview in the world that you
[3267.24 --> 3275.18]  know either, their belief system either carries no worldview changing significance, they give no historic
[3275.18 --> 3281.66]  details on the foundation of their belief system or there's just no historic events which the foundation
[3281.66 --> 3289.02]  of what they believe can be checked. So basically, and this is a little oversimplified but it's no less true,
[3289.02 --> 3296.78]  other religions are started by one of three things, a private dream about God, a private angelic encounter
[3296.78 --> 3306.14]  with God or a private idea about God. And then that one person who had that encounter or idea goes and tells
[3306.14 --> 3315.36]  everyone what they had experienced. But not Christianity. The central theme of Christianity is this, that Jesus
[3315.36 --> 3323.82]  was born publicly. And after living for 30 years on this earth, he started a public ministry which he lived out
[3323.82 --> 3333.18]  publicly. Christ was then accused, put on trial, and killed publicly. Three days later, the tomb was publicly
[3333.18 --> 3341.04]  empty. And Christ, after rising from that tomb, publicly showed himself to the public. The public then, about
[3341.04 --> 3348.86]  500 people according to Paul, then told everyone what they had seen. We read about it. It's in the Bible. It's
[3348.86 --> 3355.88]  documented in other historic literature too. This happens. Israel is a real place. The wars and events
[3355.88 --> 3361.68]  found in the Old Testament actually happened. Literature from around the world backs that up.
[3362.42 --> 3369.12]  The kings, queens, prophets, and people mentioned in the Bible are real people. Jesus actually did come
[3369.12 --> 3376.00]  and he came for a real purpose. Jesus lived this perfect life that you and I fail to live each and every
[3376.00 --> 3384.66]  day. And people saw him live it. They saw him walk and talk and eat fish. Then he died a horrible death
[3384.66 --> 3391.68]  on the cross. A death that you and I, we all deserve because of our sin. But he took that sin onto his
[3391.68 --> 3401.96]  shoulders. And people watched him die. People helped him die. People killed him. But then three days later,
[3401.96 --> 3408.30]  Jesus rose again from the grave. The tomb was empty. And people have to account for that too somehow.
[3409.60 --> 3414.44]  But Jesus showed himself to over 500 people in this world and then he ascended to heaven where he
[3414.44 --> 3421.52]  seated at the right hand of God the Father, saving everyone who hears and believes in what he accomplished.
[3421.52 --> 3431.10]  Rahab was spared a punishment she deserved because she heard about God, what he had done,
[3431.84 --> 3435.34]  and acknowledged that only God could save her.
[3437.20 --> 3444.70]  Like Rahab, we are spared a punishment we deserve when we hear what Christ has done
[3444.70 --> 3452.50]  and acknowledge that he saves us. And that's where the button meets the hole, to borrow an analogy from
[3452.50 --> 3462.76]  my late mentor, Pastor Bill. Because once God's sovereign power and authority over all things is revealed,
[3464.26 --> 3468.58]  once we hear that God has been an active God throughout history,
[3468.58 --> 3476.90]  and that Jesus bore the punishment for our sin in his life, in his death, and in his resurrection,
[3477.86 --> 3480.12]  we can respond in one of two ways.
[3482.60 --> 3485.72]  With recognition or with resistance.
[3488.10 --> 3492.38]  That's a theme, actually, throughout the book of Joshua following Rahab's story.
[3492.38 --> 3496.64]  As the Israelite people continued to move their way into the promised land,
[3496.64 --> 3499.96]  nations that recognized God's power surrendered,
[3500.58 --> 3505.18]  and they were saved. Like the Gibeonites in Joshua 9, 24 to 27.
[3505.46 --> 3507.84]  Now granted, the Gibeonites too, they were pretty sinful.
[3507.96 --> 3510.44]  They tried to trick their way into that salvation first, and so
[3510.44 --> 3514.48]  it came with some punishments, but they were spared and welcomed into the land.
[3514.58 --> 3516.16]  Others resisted God's power, though.
[3516.96 --> 3519.80]  They resisted God's authority, and they were destroyed.
[3519.92 --> 3522.06]  Like the Amorites in Joshua 10.
[3522.06 --> 3526.76]  When we hear of what God has done throughout history,
[3527.00 --> 3531.06]  we respond with either recognition or resistance.
[3532.52 --> 3538.28]  And in our culture right now, resistance is becoming the response we see more and more.
[3539.14 --> 3541.20]  Now, Pastor Chris has said it many times up here,
[3541.36 --> 3544.14]  and I've said it too, just far less, because I'm up here a little bit less.
[3544.14 --> 3549.26]  But our world is increasingly becoming more and more pagan,
[3550.26 --> 3553.88]  as we become a more and more post-Christian culture.
[3554.68 --> 3558.62]  Now, one of the bigger movements we are seeing in our culture right now
[3558.62 --> 3561.42]  that highlights how post-Christian we have come
[3561.42 --> 3563.90]  is the deconstruction movement.
[3564.08 --> 3566.28]  Now, I'm going to be doing a lot of air quotes in just a minute,
[3566.38 --> 3568.00]  and I really need you to see those,
[3568.30 --> 3570.70]  because if you don't see them, you're going to misunderstand what I'm saying.
[3570.70 --> 3573.08]  All right, so there are people in this world.
[3573.36 --> 3577.86]  There are influencers, coaches, there's companies now even,
[3578.28 --> 3582.34]  that are out there that help people who have grown up in the church.
[3582.90 --> 3586.48]  And they help them by deconstructing that faith.
[3586.96 --> 3591.54]  They're out there basically to assist people move away from Christianity
[3591.54 --> 3595.74]  and find true purpose away from Jesus.
[3595.74 --> 3600.82]  All right, one online coaching service that has helped people
[3600.82 --> 3605.52]  come to this realization recently posted the following quote on social media,
[3605.64 --> 3607.86]  which sort of encapsulates this movement well.
[3608.32 --> 3609.26]  This quote said this,
[3610.64 --> 3613.90]  When others tell me that the reason I left the church
[3613.90 --> 3618.22]  was simply because I really didn't know the one true God,
[3618.30 --> 3619.98]  the truth is, I did.
[3619.98 --> 3624.10]  The problem was that in order to believe in him,
[3624.40 --> 3625.36]  notice the quotes,
[3625.98 --> 3627.94]  I had to keep abandoning myself.
[3628.98 --> 3633.24]  So instead, I chose me for the first time.
[3634.38 --> 3636.08]  That is copied and pasted.
[3638.10 --> 3639.30]  Now, first things first,
[3639.42 --> 3642.28]  I believe the reason this is attractive to so many people
[3642.28 --> 3644.92]  is because people's identities are at stake.
[3644.92 --> 3650.42]  And so we need to be able to discuss this mindset graciously and genuinely
[3650.42 --> 3652.42]  with people who are considering it
[3652.42 --> 3656.86]  and not be outright dismissive or abrasive when we come across it.
[3656.90 --> 3661.24]  But second, I think it's extremely important when we look at that quote,
[3661.34 --> 3662.70]  and you can keep it on the screen behind me,
[3663.64 --> 3669.88]  to highlight how intertwined deconstructionism is with individualism.
[3669.88 --> 3672.80]  That last line,
[3673.40 --> 3676.38]  I chose me for the first time.
[3679.16 --> 3680.80]  There's a good response to this.
[3680.86 --> 3682.04]  You can go to the next slide there, Enoch.
[3682.92 --> 3684.48]  For many people,
[3685.44 --> 3687.86]  deconstruction isn't about recognizing God.
[3688.00 --> 3691.40]  It's about choosing to be your own God.
[3692.70 --> 3695.20]  See, the deconstructionist resists God
[3695.20 --> 3697.26]  and elevates the self.
[3697.26 --> 3700.42]  The deconstructionist makes life about them.
[3700.94 --> 3702.62]  They can find themselves.
[3702.84 --> 3703.94]  They can save themselves.
[3704.12 --> 3706.00]  They can choose themselves.
[3707.16 --> 3710.32]  It's my life, my rights, my choice, my freedoms.
[3710.46 --> 3715.08]  And for those of you who think this is a leftist versus rightist argument,
[3715.22 --> 3715.74]  it's not.
[3716.56 --> 3721.06]  This encapsulates all political leanings.
[3721.06 --> 3725.68]  The deconstructionist makes life about them.
[3725.68 --> 3730.34]  And it makes them the gods of their own life.
[3731.32 --> 3733.26]  The believer, though,
[3734.32 --> 3735.76]  through faith,
[3736.48 --> 3737.58]  doesn't resist,
[3738.30 --> 3740.06]  but recognizes God
[3740.06 --> 3742.54]  and raises up Christ,
[3742.72 --> 3744.98]  elevating Him above themselves.
[3746.44 --> 3748.84]  The believer recognizes God.
[3748.92 --> 3750.62]  They put their hope in Him
[3750.62 --> 3753.16]  because of what He has already done.
[3753.16 --> 3758.18]  Rahab recognized that there was nowhere
[3758.18 --> 3760.18]  where God is not God,
[3760.32 --> 3761.82]  including her own city, Jericho.
[3762.02 --> 3763.70]  She cut herself off, actually,
[3763.86 --> 3765.06]  from her background.
[3765.48 --> 3767.12]  She cut herself off from her nation.
[3767.52 --> 3768.68]  She even became a traitor
[3768.68 --> 3769.68]  when she lied to the king.
[3769.84 --> 3772.54]  She put all of her chips in for God.
[3773.08 --> 3774.94]  She cast herself completely out
[3774.94 --> 3777.52]  of her own culture
[3777.52 --> 3780.24]  and cast herself completely on
[3780.24 --> 3781.62]  the mercy of God
[3781.62 --> 3783.02]  and the faithfulness of His people.
[3783.76 --> 3785.72]  And salvation was granted to her
[3785.72 --> 3787.18]  because she was confident
[3787.18 --> 3788.64]  in what she hoped for
[3788.64 --> 3791.28]  and assured about what she did not see.
[3792.62 --> 3793.44]  Through faith,
[3793.66 --> 3795.12]  she recognized God.
[3795.12 --> 3798.82]  When we look at all that God has done
[3798.82 --> 3799.56]  throughout history,
[3799.88 --> 3800.96]  be that human history
[3800.96 --> 3803.58]  or be that your own history,
[3804.44 --> 3806.56]  we can also be confident
[3806.56 --> 3807.70]  in what we hope for.
[3809.80 --> 3810.32]  Salvation.
[3811.20 --> 3812.42]  From our sins,
[3812.86 --> 3813.84]  from our past,
[3813.96 --> 3814.86]  from our addictions,
[3815.12 --> 3815.80]  from our troubles,
[3816.18 --> 3817.62]  and we can be assured
[3817.62 --> 3819.10]  of what we do not see.
[3819.90 --> 3820.90]  That Christ,
[3821.62 --> 3822.30]  through His life,
[3822.46 --> 3822.90]  His death,
[3822.94 --> 3823.76]  and His resurrection,
[3823.76 --> 3826.34]  has already won the war,
[3827.18 --> 3828.64]  and His Spirit is here
[3828.64 --> 3829.72]  to help us in life.
[3830.10 --> 3830.84]  In a moment,
[3831.62 --> 3833.22]  we are going to hear a testimony
[3833.22 --> 3834.82]  about just that.
[3835.32 --> 3836.10]  But before we do,
[3836.22 --> 3837.32]  please bow your heads with me.
[3837.36 --> 3837.96]  Let's just pray.
[3840.82 --> 3841.64]  Father in heaven,
[3841.72 --> 3843.94]  as we look throughout human history,
[3844.06 --> 3844.90]  as we look throughout
[3844.90 --> 3845.92]  our own histories,
[3845.92 --> 3847.86]  we know that You are an active God.
[3848.84 --> 3851.62]  Father, we read about
[3851.62 --> 3853.16]  what Jesus accomplished
[3853.16 --> 3854.12]  in His life
[3854.12 --> 3854.98]  and in His death
[3854.98 --> 3855.82]  and in His resurrection.
[3856.20 --> 3858.30]  We hear about what Christ
[3858.30 --> 3859.58]  has done for all of us.
[3860.44 --> 3861.36]  And God, we pray
[3861.36 --> 3862.96]  that our response to that
[3862.96 --> 3863.98]  is not one of resistance,
[3864.22 --> 3865.58]  but of recognition.
[3866.44 --> 3867.16]  That we can recognize
[3867.70 --> 3869.28]  that He is the one who saves.
[3869.74 --> 3870.76]  It's nothing we do.
[3871.24 --> 3872.40]  It's nothing we earn.
[3873.84 --> 3875.26]  Christianity is not a faith
[3875.26 --> 3878.90]  that demands works for salvation.
[3878.90 --> 3882.28]  Christianity is a faith
[3882.28 --> 3887.14]  about You saving us
[3887.14 --> 3888.68]  and our response
[3888.68 --> 3890.08]  to that salvation.
[3890.54 --> 3892.00]  Lord, as we are about to hear
[3892.00 --> 3893.38]  a testimony now,
[3893.44 --> 3894.72]  we pray that You will be with John.
[3894.82 --> 3895.58]  Allow his words
[3895.58 --> 3897.18]  to resonate in this community
[3897.18 --> 3898.22]  and may Your Spirit
[3898.22 --> 3899.16]  be present with him.
[3899.58 --> 3900.44]  We pray this in Your name.
[3900.88 --> 3901.14]  Amen.
[3902.18 --> 3903.16]  I'm going to invite
[3903.16 --> 3904.54]  John Kuypers.
[3904.68 --> 3905.26]  He's going to come
[3905.26 --> 3906.18]  to the front right now.
[3906.18 --> 3909.22]  We prayed for John earlier today.
[3910.24 --> 3911.10]  Perhaps you know him.
[3911.14 --> 3911.64]  Perhaps you don't.
[3911.70 --> 3912.58]  But John has been struggling
[3912.58 --> 3913.24]  with his health
[3913.24 --> 3914.72]  over the last 10 years.
[3914.90 --> 3916.26]  And he's about to share
[3916.26 --> 3917.30]  his testimony now
[3917.30 --> 3919.68]  about how when we recognize
[3919.68 --> 3920.86]  what God is doing,
[3921.10 --> 3922.22]  through the work of His Spirit
[3922.22 --> 3922.74]  and through the work
[3922.74 --> 3923.56]  of His people,
[3923.82 --> 3924.86]  we can be confident
[3924.86 --> 3926.84]  in God's salvation for us.
[3927.22 --> 3927.92]  Take it away, John.
[3932.92 --> 3933.94]  Morning, my friends.
[3934.40 --> 3934.68]  Oh, here.
[3935.06 --> 3936.16]  I should get you a microphone, hey?
[3936.54 --> 3937.24]  That would be better.
[3943.82 --> 3944.48]  Good morning.
[3946.22 --> 3947.16]  When I found out
[3947.16 --> 3948.20]  that there was a new treatment
[3948.20 --> 3949.16]  available for me
[3949.16 --> 3951.12]  and the pain that I've had
[3951.12 --> 3952.10]  for the last 10 years,
[3952.18 --> 3953.96]  I knew I had to face monsters
[3953.96 --> 3955.46]  who I had trusted
[3955.46 --> 3956.42]  for far too long.
[3957.48 --> 3959.00]  Opioids, nerve pain blockers
[3959.00 --> 3960.10]  and antidepressants,
[3960.42 --> 3961.34]  10 different ones
[3961.34 --> 3962.00]  that I was on.
[3962.50 --> 3963.26]  And it was all done
[3963.26 --> 3963.84]  the right way
[3963.84 --> 3964.98]  through the healthcare system.
[3964.98 --> 3967.16]  I knew I couldn't do this
[3967.16 --> 3967.78]  on my own,
[3968.10 --> 3969.50]  so I called the prayer warriors
[3969.50 --> 3970.00]  that I knew.
[3970.78 --> 3971.98]  I need the strength
[3971.98 --> 3973.56]  to make it to the end
[3973.56 --> 3974.60]  without sliding back.
[3975.66 --> 3976.64]  Thank you all
[3976.64 --> 3977.26]  for the prayers
[3977.26 --> 3977.96]  that I feel
[3977.96 --> 3979.36]  as I face this monster
[3979.36 --> 3980.04]  head to head.
[3981.34 --> 3982.10]  What I feel
[3982.10 --> 3983.06]  from your prayers
[3983.06 --> 3984.10]  makes me remember
[3984.10 --> 3984.64]  the power
[3984.64 --> 3985.84]  that is there.
[3985.84 --> 3988.12]  I feel them in my heart
[3988.12 --> 3989.56]  and I cannot do it
[3989.56 --> 3991.22]  without them.
[3992.80 --> 3994.66]  When we need help,
[3994.74 --> 3995.32]  no one will know
[3995.32 --> 3996.22]  unless you ask.
[3996.46 --> 3997.86]  We will never have the strength
[3997.86 --> 3998.90]  if it isn't for prayer.
[3999.38 --> 4000.36]  In my opinion,
[4000.52 --> 4001.04]  saying nothing
[4001.04 --> 4002.52]  is a recipe for failure
[4002.52 --> 4003.64]  and I know
[4003.64 --> 4004.66]  what that feels like.
[4005.34 --> 4006.80]  I was ashamed to think
[4006.80 --> 4007.82]  that I fell for something
[4007.82 --> 4008.68]  at that time
[4008.68 --> 4010.14]  that I thought was right.
[4010.50 --> 4011.56]  I believe these drugs
[4011.56 --> 4012.30]  were from God
[4012.30 --> 4013.40]  to help me through the pain
[4013.40 --> 4014.22]  and they really did
[4014.22 --> 4015.20]  their job well.
[4016.34 --> 4017.72]  I didn't see the trap
[4017.72 --> 4019.04]  when the doctors
[4019.04 --> 4021.28]  just added one at a time
[4021.28 --> 4022.40]  and it snuck up on me
[4022.40 --> 4023.46]  like a thief in the night.
[4024.78 --> 4026.56]  Now I can see clearly again
[4026.56 --> 4027.64]  and I thank you
[4027.64 --> 4028.96]  from the bottom of my heart.
[4030.24 --> 4031.12]  Pastor Chris shared
[4031.12 --> 4032.16]  this verse with me
[4032.16 --> 4034.22]  after that really confirmed
[4034.22 --> 4035.20]  what I felt.
[4035.50 --> 4036.98]  This is from Isaiah 46,
[4037.08 --> 4037.64]  verse 4.
[4038.26 --> 4038.84]  And I quote,
[4039.34 --> 4040.68]  Even to your old age
[4040.68 --> 4041.56]  and gray hairs,
[4041.68 --> 4042.20]  I am he,
[4042.32 --> 4042.80]  says the Lord.
[4042.80 --> 4043.78]  I have made you
[4043.78 --> 4044.78]  and I will carry you,
[4044.90 --> 4045.96]  I will sustain you,
[4046.42 --> 4047.96]  and I will rescue you.
[4049.94 --> 4051.02]  The word of the Lord.
[4057.30 --> 4058.80]  You thought life was good.
[4059.08 --> 4059.62]  You said,
[4060.24 --> 4061.10]  It's mine to take,
[4061.18 --> 4062.00]  it's mine to own,
[4062.06 --> 4063.00]  it's mine to live.
[4063.44 --> 4064.20]  You thought life
[4064.20 --> 4065.06]  was about pleasure.
[4065.62 --> 4066.56]  It's mine to feel,
[4066.76 --> 4067.84]  it's mine to hold,
[4067.92 --> 4068.82]  it's mine to live.
[4069.64 --> 4070.32]  You thought life
[4070.32 --> 4071.20]  was about fun.
[4071.20 --> 4072.96]  It's mine to choose,
[4073.06 --> 4074.00]  it's mine to decide,
[4074.18 --> 4075.48]  and it is mine to live.
[4076.20 --> 4077.22]  But that didn't quite
[4077.22 --> 4078.20]  work out, did it?
[4079.02 --> 4080.40]  It's not what you dreamt,
[4080.44 --> 4081.94]  it's not how you wanted it,
[4081.98 --> 4083.20]  and it sure wasn't the plan.
[4084.18 --> 4085.18]  So my friends,
[4085.66 --> 4087.00]  this is my prayer for you.
[4088.10 --> 4089.64]  May you see with your eyes
[4089.64 --> 4090.68]  and hear with your ears
[4090.68 --> 4092.28]  quiet the noises around you,
[4092.34 --> 4093.00]  quiet the thoughts
[4093.00 --> 4093.54]  in your mind,
[4093.60 --> 4094.30]  and know this,
[4094.30 --> 4096.84]  God doesn't just leave you.
[4096.94 --> 4097.94]  God won't punish you,
[4098.16 --> 4099.40]  and God doesn't forget you.
[4100.54 --> 4102.10]  He's carried the cross for you
[4102.10 --> 4103.08]  so you wouldn't have to.
[4103.18 --> 4103.76]  He hung there,
[4103.86 --> 4104.38]  and he died
[4104.38 --> 4105.70]  so you wouldn't have to bear it,
[4105.72 --> 4106.24]  and he rose
[4106.24 --> 4107.58]  so you could live with him.
[4107.62 --> 4109.10]  He calls you by your name.
[4109.68 --> 4111.16]  So listen in the silence.
[4111.86 --> 4112.98]  You will hear him calling.
[4113.62 --> 4113.92]  Listen.
[4114.76 --> 4115.82]  You will hear the whisper
[4115.82 --> 4117.02]  in the quiet of night.
[4117.16 --> 4117.86]  You will hear it
[4117.86 --> 4119.22]  in the depths of your pain.
[4119.76 --> 4120.14]  You see?
[4121.10 --> 4122.44]  God can only use us
[4122.44 --> 4123.60]  if we're broken in pieces
[4123.60 --> 4125.68]  and in need with him.
[4125.76 --> 4126.76]  With arms wide open,
[4126.88 --> 4128.06]  he calls you by name.
[4128.94 --> 4130.94]  So let this be my prayer for you.
[4131.84 --> 4133.12]  You will become his child.
[4133.28 --> 4134.18]  You will become strong.
[4134.28 --> 4135.28]  You will become powerful
[4135.28 --> 4136.36]  in Jesus' name.
[4136.46 --> 4137.22]  Take his spirit.
[4137.66 --> 4138.64]  He left here for you.
[4138.76 --> 4139.76]  Take hold, my friends.
[4139.92 --> 4140.66]  God will love you.
[4140.74 --> 4142.34]  He will fill your void.
[4142.46 --> 4143.28]  He will carry you
[4143.28 --> 4144.32]  when you can't walk.
[4144.38 --> 4145.48]  He will show you the path,
[4145.52 --> 4146.78]  and he will make you his child.
[4147.74 --> 4148.68]  That, my friends,
[4148.74 --> 4150.10]  is my prayer to you.
[4150.84 --> 4152.14]  You thought you wanted more.
[4152.72 --> 4153.08]  You said,
[4153.16 --> 4153.72]  it's my life.
[4153.78 --> 4154.06]  You said,
[4154.10 --> 4155.26]  I can do it on my own,
[4155.36 --> 4156.16]  but you didn't know
[4156.16 --> 4156.74]  what you needed.
[4156.90 --> 4158.16]  You found a way to escape.
[4158.30 --> 4159.20]  You found a way to hide.
[4159.32 --> 4159.90]  You found a way
[4159.90 --> 4160.90]  you thought was good,
[4160.96 --> 4161.98]  and life would be great.
[4162.32 --> 4162.64]  Then,
[4163.70 --> 4165.14]  when things did fall apart,
[4166.18 --> 4166.78]  you forgot
[4166.78 --> 4168.14]  you could go back.
[4168.22 --> 4168.80]  You didn't know
[4168.80 --> 4169.68]  there was another way.
[4169.78 --> 4170.28]  You didn't know
[4170.28 --> 4171.04]  that someone cared
[4171.04 --> 4171.90]  and loved you always.
[4173.00 --> 4173.88]  So please,
[4174.82 --> 4176.22]  let this be my prayer
[4176.22 --> 4177.16]  for you, my friends.
[4178.14 --> 4180.08]  May the grace of God
[4180.08 --> 4180.68]  fill you up.
[4180.74 --> 4181.66]  May the love of God
[4181.66 --> 4182.36]  fill your void.
[4182.48 --> 4183.52]  May the peace of God
[4183.52 --> 4184.14]  fill your mind
[4184.14 --> 4185.14]  with songs of love.
[4185.74 --> 4186.58]  Take his spirit
[4186.58 --> 4187.54]  and run, my friends.
[4187.66 --> 4189.14]  Nothing can stop you now.
[4190.20 --> 4190.92]  Trust in him
[4190.92 --> 4191.74]  to change your heart.
[4191.86 --> 4192.32]  Love others
[4192.32 --> 4193.28]  as you love yourself.
[4193.42 --> 4194.08]  Take his spirit
[4194.08 --> 4194.92]  and run, my friends.
[4195.04 --> 4196.22]  Nothing's stopping you now.
[4196.94 --> 4198.30]  Nothing is stopping you now.
[4199.04 --> 4200.28]  May the grace of God
[4200.28 --> 4200.90]  fill you up.
[4200.98 --> 4201.90]  May the love of God
[4201.90 --> 4202.56]  fill your heart.
[4202.56 --> 4203.66]  May the peace of God
[4203.66 --> 4204.24]  fill your mind
[4204.24 --> 4205.24]  with songs of joy.
[4206.36 --> 4207.04]  Take his spirit
[4207.04 --> 4208.04]  and run, my friends.
[4208.42 --> 4209.92]  Nothing can stop you now
[4209.92 --> 4211.90]  and nothing will stop you now.
[4212.78 --> 4213.84]  Take his spirit
[4213.84 --> 4215.00]  and run, my friends.
[4215.72 --> 4217.58]  Nothing's going to stop you now.
[4218.30 --> 4219.92]  Nothing will stop you now
[4219.92 --> 4222.46]  and nothing can stop you now.
[4223.52 --> 4224.54]  That, my friends,
[4224.60 --> 4225.88]  is my prayer for you.
[4226.50 --> 4227.28]  So please,
[4228.02 --> 4230.44]  let it be my prayer for you.
[4231.44 --> 4232.36]  Praise be to God.
[4232.56 --> 4233.56]  Thank you.
[4246.06 --> 4246.90]  Why don't we pray?
[4247.40 --> 4248.08]  And then I'm going to invite
[4248.08 --> 4248.86]  the worship team forward
[4248.86 --> 4249.68]  to lead us in worship.
[4249.94 --> 4250.36]  Father God,
[4250.42 --> 4252.00]  we thank you so much for story.
[4252.50 --> 4253.74]  We thank you for the work
[4253.74 --> 4254.44]  that you are doing
[4254.44 --> 4255.34]  in John's life
[4255.34 --> 4256.48]  and continue to do
[4256.48 --> 4259.84]  as he faces this monster
[4259.84 --> 4260.98]  head on as he says.
[4260.98 --> 4261.86]  God, will you continue
[4261.86 --> 4262.84]  to work in his life?
[4262.90 --> 4263.42]  We thank you
[4263.42 --> 4264.42]  for your spirit's presence
[4264.42 --> 4265.20]  in his community,
[4265.36 --> 4266.64]  for the prayers offered up to him
[4266.64 --> 4268.80]  that he feels each and every day.
[4269.68 --> 4270.70]  And God, we thank you
[4270.70 --> 4272.22]  that you work through story.
[4272.32 --> 4272.80]  We thank you
[4272.80 --> 4274.32]  that John recognizes
[4274.32 --> 4275.42]  who you are
[4275.42 --> 4277.86]  and that he is saved
[4277.86 --> 4278.56]  because of that.
[4279.54 --> 4279.92]  So God,
[4279.98 --> 4280.68]  as we continue
[4280.68 --> 4281.58]  to live this life,
[4281.72 --> 4283.30]  may John's prayer for us
[4283.30 --> 4284.42]  ring true.
[4285.24 --> 4286.52]  We pray this in your name.
[4286.52 --> 4287.32]  Amen.
[4287.98 --> 4288.42]  Amen.
[4296.98 --> 4299.32]  Where the spirit of the Lord is,
[4299.44 --> 4300.02]  there is freedom.
[4300.84 --> 4301.86]  Why don't we all rise
[4301.86 --> 4302.46]  and see that
[4302.46 --> 4305.42]  as we respond to what God
[4305.42 --> 4306.38]  has been sharing.
[4306.38 --> 4322.94]  where the spirit of the Lord is,
[4322.94 --> 4326.16]  there is freedom.
[4330.16 --> 4333.94]  Where the spirit of the Lord is,
[4333.94 --> 4336.94]  there is freedom.
[4336.94 --> 4337.38]  There is freedom.

[4345.98 --> 4347.72]  There is freedom.
[4351.72 --> 4354.30]  Lift your eyes to heaven.
[4354.72 --> 4358.32]  There is freedom.

[4363.28 --> 4367.28]  Freedom reigns in this place.
[4367.28 --> 4372.70]  Showers of mercy and grace.
[4373.38 --> 4377.40]  Falling on every face.

[4403.70 --> 4406.40]  If you're tired of mercy.
[4408.40 --> 4410.32]  There is freedom.
[4414.32 --> 4416.86]  If you're tired of mercy.
[4416.86 --> 4418.94]  there is freedom.
[4419.06 --> 4423.84]  There is freedom.
[4423.84 --> 4425.74]  Give your all to Jesus.

[4440.94 --> 4449.76]  Jesus reigns in this place
[4449.76 --> 4455.00]  Showers of mercy and grace
[4455.00 --> 4459.44]  Falling on every face

[4521.90 --> 4527.90]  There is freedom
[4527.90 --> 4536.90]  John, thank you so much for coming up here, for being bold and for sharing your story.
[4537.06 --> 4538.60]  We are so grateful for that.
[4538.90 --> 4543.88]  And I invite anyone who has a story to share about God's faithfulness in their life.
[4543.88 --> 4547.10]  Please feel free to come talk to me or to Pastor Chris this week.
[4547.14 --> 4551.56]  We would love to be able to share more stories about what God is doing in our community here.
[4552.62 --> 4557.48]  Please join us afterwards for some fellowship in the foyer there for some coffee and tea.
[4557.56 --> 4558.98]  Don't just run away into the smoke.
[4559.08 --> 4561.18]  We'd love to chat a little bit more with you.
[4561.18 --> 4568.34]  But before we close this service, please hear this priestly blessing from number six.
[4569.38 --> 4571.72]  The Lord bless you and keep you.
[4572.50 --> 4576.62]  The Lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[4577.44 --> 4581.88]  The Lord turn his face toward you and give you his peace.
[4581.88 --> 4584.96]  And all God's people said, Amen.
[4604.40 --> 4608.64]  You're the Lion of Judah, the Lamb who was seen.
[4608.64 --> 4612.54]  You've ascended to heaven and evermore will reign.
[4612.84 --> 4616.50]  At the end of the age when the earth you became.
[4616.94 --> 4620.16]  We'll gather the nations before you.
[4620.82 --> 4627.30]  At the age of all men, the defense of the Lamb who was crucified.
[4628.72 --> 4636.50]  With wisdom and mercy and justice, you'll reign at your Father's side.
[4636.50 --> 4642.50]  And the angels will cry, Hail the Lamb.
[4643.90 --> 4650.10]  Who was slain for the world, rule in power.
[4652.04 --> 4658.22]  And the earth will reply, You shall reign.
[4659.88 --> 4664.76]  As the King of all kings and the Lord of all worlds.
[4666.50 --> 4675.94]  There's a shield in our hand and a sword at our side.
[4675.94 --> 4679.78]  There's a fire in our spirit that cannot be denied.
[4680.14 --> 4683.94]  Because the Father has told us for the easy will die.
[4684.30 --> 4687.24]  The nations are gathering for you.
[4688.00 --> 4693.70]  And the ears of all men need to hear of the Lamb who was crucified.
[4693.70 --> 4699.70]  Who descended to hell and was raised up to Him.
[4699.70 --> 4709.14]  And the angels will cry, Hail the Lamb.
[4709.14 --> 4717.14]  Who was slain for the world, rule in power.
[4717.14 --> 4725.14]  And the earth will reply, You shall reign.
[4725.14 --> 4731.34]  As the King of all kings and the Lord of all worlds.
[4731.34 --> 4737.14]  And the angels will cry, Hail the Lamb.
[4737.14 --> 4739.14]  Who was slain for the Lord of all worlds.
[4739.14 --> 4744.14]  Who was slain for the world, rule in power.
[4744.14 --> 4752.14]  And the earth will reply, You shall reign.
[4752.14 --> 4762.14]  As the King of all kings and the Lord of all worlds.
[4762.14 --> 4764.14]  And the Lord of all worlds.
[4764.14 --> 4766.14]  And the Lord of all worlds.
[4766.14 --> 4767.14]  I believe.
[4767.14 --> 4769.66]  irgendwie of slain for the knowledge of them.
[4777.74 --> 4779.14]  In the Los Angeles time.
[4782.14 --> 4782.84]  For your grace prepared.
[4782.84 --> 4812.82]  Thank you.
[4812.84 --> 4842.82]  Thank you.
[4842.84 --> 4872.82]  Thank you.
