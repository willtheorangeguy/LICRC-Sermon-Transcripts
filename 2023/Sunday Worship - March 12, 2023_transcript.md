[423.00 --> 424.00]  .
[424.00 --> 424.08]  .
[424.08 --> 429.34]  we should all just stop talking when that happens. And just wait, no, don't do that,
[429.36 --> 431.90]  because I'll probably be the one talking at that point, right? Yeah, I don't know.
[433.40 --> 437.72]  Welcome to worship. We are excited that you are here. My name is Chris. I'm one of the pastors
[437.72 --> 444.72]  here at Langley Emanuel, and it is my privilege, along with a few others, to lead in our shared
[444.72 --> 449.86]  worship this morning. This morning is a special service. Not only do we have a chance to celebrate
[449.86 --> 455.84]  Lord's Supper together, but we are going to be commissioning our team to the Mexico mission.
[456.16 --> 462.84]  They leave on Saturday of this coming week. And so if you're visiting to support them, thank you for
[462.84 --> 468.22]  being here. If you came early this morning and had pancake breakfast, thank you for that and
[468.22 --> 473.20]  participating in that. It was great to see so many people out and sharing a meal before our worship
[473.20 --> 477.48]  together. Before we begin, we have a couple announcements to make, and so I'm going to
[477.48 --> 485.08]  invite Josh to come up. And as Josh is on his way up, I just want to start by saying a huge thank you
[485.08 --> 493.46]  to everyone who helped this past Tuesday and Wednesday with Classis. And so Classis is the
[493.46 --> 499.48]  regional gathering of Christian Reformed churches here in sort of the Fraser Valley and up into
[499.48 --> 506.90]  the south part of the interior. Anyway, we gathered for a day and a half of meetings here, and that was
[506.90 --> 512.52]  an incredible joy in part because of all of your work in volunteering and in pulling that together.
[513.38 --> 519.30]  And Dolores Vartstra was a champion in the midst of all of that. She did amazing things.
[522.74 --> 525.38]  However, if I don't see Dolores, she's still recovering.
[526.50 --> 528.02]  Yeah, still recovering.
[528.02 --> 534.26]  But we are indeed grateful for all of you and for the way that we came together in providing for that.
[534.82 --> 535.94]  Thank you. Thank you.
[541.62 --> 542.02]  Hello?
[544.34 --> 545.46]  Sorry, that surprised me too.
[546.66 --> 550.92]  So, for the young adults, just wanted to remind you that the Bible study is today, an hour after church,
[551.14 --> 552.50]  at my house. Thanks.
[552.50 --> 555.70]  Thank you.
[557.38 --> 562.98]  In case you didn't get that, there's a Bible study at Josh's house. If you're a young adult or young adult-ish,
[563.46 --> 564.90]  grab him. He'll give you details.
[566.34 --> 574.34]  I do also want to just mention this week coming, we are having Christianity Explored class on Wednesday.
[574.34 --> 580.02]  We meet here at 7 p.m. If that's something you're interested in, grab me. That's a course, really,
[580.18 --> 587.62]  for people who are new to faith or who are returning to faith after years away. Just an introduction to what it means to be
[587.62 --> 592.68]  Christian. We encourage you to come and to bring someone with whom you have been talking about faith.
[593.46 --> 597.30]  As well, there's 2020 tonight. That's for the youth.
[597.30 --> 602.26]  If you have any questions about what that looks like, you can grab Pastor Kevin and he will answer those.
[604.42 --> 612.76]  Let's stop there. Let's stand as we are welcomed in God's presence with his greeting and by his grace.
[614.58 --> 618.36]  Receive the greeting of God as we worship him this morning.
[618.36 --> 628.60]  grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son, and our Savior,
[629.28 --> 632.96]  through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[635.90 --> 642.64]  You may greet those around you. Take a moment and say hello. Give, pass the peace.
[642.64 --> 662.00]  Thank you.
[665.76 --> 667.66]  Thank you.
[667.68 --> 668.16]  Fit.
[668.16 --> 668.36]  Thank you.
[668.36 --> 669.44]  Hi, Linda.
[669.44 --> 669.72]  Bye.
[669.72 --> 669.76]  Bye.
[670.14 --> 670.24]  ...
[670.24 --> 671.84]  Do you want to join us?
[671.84 --> 695.66]  Come all you people, come and praise your Maker.
[695.66 --> 700.40]  Come all you people, come and praise your Maker.

[728.10 --> 742.10]  Come all you people, come and praise the Spirit.
[742.10 --> 747.10]  Come now and worship the Lord.
[747.10 --> 761.10]  Come all you people, come and praise your Maker.
[761.10 --> 766.10]  Come now and worship the Lord.
[766.10 --> 772.10]  Come now and worship the Lord.
[772.10 --> 776.10]  Please bow with me in prayer.
[776.10 --> 781.10]  Lord God, we gather in this place not because we're deserving of your love
[781.10 --> 785.10]  and not because we've lived faithfully before your face.
[785.10 --> 788.10]  We gather here because you've called us.
[788.10 --> 791.10]  You loved us before we could love you.
[791.10 --> 793.10]  You've given your Son for our salvation.
[793.10 --> 800.10]  And for this we join all creation in blessing you and praising you and thanking you.
[800.10 --> 806.10]  Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God Almighty, you are great and greatly to be praised.
[806.10 --> 811.10]  As we offer our praise, we long for you to mold us in the image of your Son,
[811.10 --> 816.10]  whose death and resurrection give us hope, through the power of the Holy Spirit.
[816.10 --> 817.10]  Amen.
[817.10 --> 824.10]  You stood before creation, eternal life,
[824.10 --> 832.10]  you stood before creation, eternal life,
[832.10 --> 838.10]  you stood before creation,
[838.10 --> 853.10]  eternity in your hand,
[853.10 --> 863.10]  you spoke the earth into motion, my soul now to stand.
[863.10 --> 866.10]  You stood before my failure,
[866.10 --> 869.10]  you stood before my failure,
[869.10 --> 874.10]  and carried the cross for my shame.
[874.10 --> 884.10]  My sin weighed upon your shoulders, my soul now to stand.
[884.10 --> 890.10]  So what can I say?
[890.10 --> 895.10]  And what can I do?
[895.10 --> 901.10]  But offer this heart, O God,
[901.10 --> 906.10]  completely to you.
[906.10 --> 910.66]  consider you how tohetically sensitive

[961.42 --> 968.46]  but offer this heart oh god
[969.02 --> 975.02]  completely

[988.38 --> 995.42]  in awe of the one who gave it all and i'll stand

[1031.50 --> 1044.54]  all i am is yours
[1044.54 --> 1049.02]  the proof of god's amazing love is this
[1051.18 --> 1054.06]  while we were sinners christ died for us
[1056.22 --> 1063.34]  let us therefore approach the throne of grace with boldness so that we may receive mercy and find
[1063.34 --> 1068.62]  grace to help in time of need trusting in god's faithfulness and compassion
[1070.94 --> 1084.38]  let's confess our sin before god and one another in silent prayer
[1084.38 --> 1111.98]  so

[1141.98 --> 1171.96]  Thank you.
[1171.98 --> 1173.98]  Thank you.
[1201.98 --> 1227.98]  Emmanuel, the rescue for sinners, the ransom from heaven, Jesus Messiah, Lord of all.
[1227.98 --> 1240.40]  His body the bread, His blood the wine, broken and poured out all for love.
[1240.40 --> 1246.40]  And the whole earth trembled and the veil was torn.
[1246.40 --> 1250.40]  Love so amazing.
[1252.40 --> 1255.40]  Love so amazing.
[1255.40 --> 1285.40] 
[1285.40 --> 1287.40]  Amen.

[1422.40 --> 1423.40]  Amen.
[1423.40 --> 1425.40]  Amen.
[1425.40 --> 1427.84]  who had no sin to be sin for us,
[1428.20 --> 1432.30]  so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
[1432.30 --> 1458.52]  In Christ alone my hope is found,
[1458.52 --> 1462.86]  he is my light, my strength, my song,
[1463.32 --> 1467.92]  this cornerstone, this solid ground,
[1468.38 --> 1472.26]  firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
[1472.74 --> 1476.52]  What heights of love, what depths of peace,
[1477.46 --> 1481.82]  when fears are stilled, when strivings cease,
[1482.30 --> 1486.94]  my comforter, my all in all,
[1486.94 --> 1492.34]  here in the love of Christ I stand.
[1500.74 --> 1506.22]  In Christ alone, who took on flesh,
[1506.68 --> 1509.94]  fullness of God in helpless babe,
[1509.94 --> 1514.66]  this gift of love and righteousness,
[1515.98 --> 1519.98]  scorned by the ones he came to save,
[1520.42 --> 1523.94]  till on that cross as Jesus died,
[1525.10 --> 1528.72]  the wrath of God was satisfied,
[1529.72 --> 1534.16]  for every sin on him was laid,
[1534.16 --> 1539.66]  here in the death of Christ I live.
[1547.56 --> 1553.24]  There in the ground his body lay,
[1553.76 --> 1557.90]  light of the world by darkness slain,
[1557.90 --> 1562.90]  then bursting forth in glorious day,
[1563.30 --> 1567.22]  up from the grave he rose again,
[1567.72 --> 1571.46]  and as he stands in victory,
[1572.50 --> 1576.72]  sin's curse has lost its grip on me,
[1577.20 --> 1581.78]  for I am his and he is mine,
[1581.78 --> 1587.06]  bought with the precious blood of Christ.
[1595.56 --> 1601.06]  No guilt in life, no fear in death,
[1601.18 --> 1605.50]  this is the power of Christ in me.
[1605.50 --> 1610.66]  From life's first cry to final breath,
[1611.10 --> 1614.42]  Jesus commands my destiny.
[1615.52 --> 1619.88]  No power of hell, no scheme of man,
[1620.30 --> 1624.62]  can ever pluck me from his hand,
[1625.06 --> 1629.68]  till he returns or calls me home,
[1630.08 --> 1633.50]  here in the power of Christ I stand.
[1633.50 --> 1658.34]  I invite you to be seated.
[1663.50 --> 1666.26]  In just under one week,
[1666.42 --> 1668.98]  a team of 10 members of this church,
[1669.10 --> 1672.96]  who range from the age of 2 to older than 2,
[1673.10 --> 1674.82]  are heading down to Mexico,
[1675.44 --> 1676.98]  and we are going to take a moment right now
[1676.98 --> 1677.74]  to commission them.
[1677.80 --> 1680.36]  So I'm going to invite Brandon Muller forward.
[1681.04 --> 1683.90]  He is one of the leaders heading on this trip,
[1683.98 --> 1685.18]  and kind of the point person,
[1685.30 --> 1686.82]  and so he is going to share a little bit
[1686.82 --> 1688.16]  about some of the people
[1688.16 --> 1689.74]  that they are going to be visiting down there,
[1689.74 --> 1692.18]  and some of the places they're going to be going.
[1693.50 --> 1694.50]  Good morning.
[1695.04 --> 1698.04]  So yeah, I don't know if there's photos or not,
[1698.10 --> 1698.52]  but anyways,
[1699.10 --> 1701.46]  we'll be working kind of with the same people
[1701.46 --> 1703.82]  we generally do year after year after year.
[1704.00 --> 1705.02]  That is the goal of the trip,
[1705.08 --> 1707.18]  is to keep building the same relationships
[1707.18 --> 1709.16]  and expanding those and helping them in their mission.
[1709.76 --> 1712.40]  So we'll be working with Mission Juiceroum Christiane,
[1712.40 --> 1717.78]  which is Pastor Abelino, Maria, Erica, Leandro,
[1718.78 --> 1720.10]  their whole church community.
[1720.88 --> 1722.18]  With them, we'll be helping with,
[1722.28 --> 1723.78]  a big thing with them is their kids ministry,
[1723.88 --> 1724.66]  as well as their youth,
[1724.70 --> 1726.38]  will be the focuses of this year again.
[1727.08 --> 1729.92]  The kids ministry is how they evangelize to the adults,
[1730.00 --> 1731.82]  because the kids bring the adults to the church,
[1731.88 --> 1734.08]  and that's their kind of plan of growth,
[1734.16 --> 1734.94]  which has, you know,
[1734.98 --> 1737.24]  showed huge results over the years.
[1737.24 --> 1738.46]  But the other one is youth.
[1738.58 --> 1740.54]  I mean, their youth struggle with the same issues ours do,
[1741.06 --> 1745.16]  but maybe a little bit more easier to fall to the wrong side
[1745.16 --> 1747.08]  and leave the church and kind of be more worldly.
[1747.64 --> 1749.66]  So they're trying to model their youth program
[1749.66 --> 1752.40]  after how Kevin Lobert has modeled our youth program.
[1753.00 --> 1754.76]  So we just often spend a couple nights with them
[1754.76 --> 1755.40]  and days with them
[1755.40 --> 1757.88]  and just kind of teaching them how the 2020 works,
[1758.02 --> 1759.66]  kind of getting their youth behind it
[1759.66 --> 1762.18]  and involved in it by just our youth talking
[1762.18 --> 1763.72]  like we do with our 2020s,
[1764.34 --> 1766.22]  doing Bible lessons with them and stuff like that,
[1766.22 --> 1768.98]  and just trying to strengthen that, you know, middle ground,
[1769.14 --> 1770.54]  that jump between the kids
[1770.54 --> 1772.32]  that are really excited about the church and God
[1772.32 --> 1774.94]  and the, you know, community and the adults
[1774.94 --> 1775.68]  where they kind of, again,
[1775.72 --> 1777.40]  understand the responsibility of it.
[1777.86 --> 1779.68]  Just trying to focus on that youth stuff.
[1779.88 --> 1780.98]  So we're working with them,
[1781.04 --> 1782.56]  and then, of course, Jody and Ariel as well.
[1783.22 --> 1784.88]  We'll be doing a couple things with them this year.
[1784.98 --> 1787.40]  We always go visit their men's rehab,
[1788.12 --> 1789.24]  the halfway house kind of thing.
[1789.52 --> 1790.60]  So we'll be visiting that
[1790.60 --> 1792.54]  and just kind of talking with the people there,
[1792.62 --> 1794.46]  hearing their stories, sharing our stories,
[1794.46 --> 1796.94]  and we often share a nice, cool dinner with them.
[1798.00 --> 1801.04]  And then we'll also be going to Jody Works
[1801.04 --> 1803.64]  slash runs a woman's Bible study
[1803.64 --> 1805.02]  for the church down there
[1805.02 --> 1808.02]  that's huge and grows huge every year,
[1808.06 --> 1808.88]  and it always surprises us,
[1808.88 --> 1810.42]  and we'll be kind of working with that as well.
[1810.86 --> 1812.70]  And then there might be some other side projects, of course,
[1812.80 --> 1814.78]  but it's Mexico slash Flexico,
[1814.88 --> 1816.50]  which means we never really know what's going to happen.
[1816.50 --> 1819.32]  But those are kind of our major ministries.
[1824.82 --> 1825.40]  All right.
[1825.50 --> 1827.48]  So Pastor Chris and I are going to lead this team
[1827.48 --> 1829.94]  in a little bit of a commissioning.
[1830.54 --> 1831.48]  Before we do that,
[1831.92 --> 1833.16]  well, actually, we're going to start
[1833.16 --> 1836.54]  by reading a bit of a liturgy here.
[1836.88 --> 1840.44]  So Pastor Chris is going to just communicate
[1840.44 --> 1841.66]  with Brandon off to the side.
[1841.72 --> 1842.50]  No one look over there.
[1842.58 --> 1843.44]  Everybody look up here.
[1843.58 --> 1845.04]  That way he can do this in quiet,
[1845.04 --> 1846.02]  and there we go.
[1846.36 --> 1848.80]  So our God is a sending God.
[1849.34 --> 1851.18]  He sent Abram to a land he didn't know
[1851.18 --> 1853.42]  and promised him a future he couldn't see.
[1853.90 --> 1857.10]  He sent Moses to stand up against the Pharaoh
[1857.10 --> 1859.68]  and cry out for the release of the oppressed people.
[1860.12 --> 1862.42]  He sent Samuel to find the next king
[1862.42 --> 1865.48]  in the unexpected youngest son named David.
[1866.00 --> 1867.96]  He sent Jonah, even though he fled,
[1868.06 --> 1870.32]  to preach the good news of repentance and forgiveness.
[1870.84 --> 1873.80]  And he sent his son into the world to redeem us.
[1873.80 --> 1878.10]  And Jesus sends his disciples down to you and I.
[1878.76 --> 1880.48]  He sends us out as missionaries
[1880.48 --> 1882.40]  and ambassadors of his reconciliation.
[1886.66 --> 1887.42]  Disciples.
[1888.08 --> 1889.40]  Christ promised his disciples
[1889.40 --> 1891.48]  that they would never be alone.
[1892.16 --> 1895.10]  He would send his spirit to be with them.
[1895.94 --> 1898.12]  This promise applies to those
[1898.12 --> 1900.78]  whose ministry is in familiar places
[1900.78 --> 1904.28]  and those who travel far to new settings
[1904.28 --> 1907.18]  for a long duration or for a shorter time.
[1908.30 --> 1910.72]  Today, we rejoice in the calling
[1910.72 --> 1912.64]  and the blessing of God.
[1913.28 --> 1914.82]  God blesses us with salvation
[1914.82 --> 1916.86]  and then blesses us with the privilege
[1916.86 --> 1921.00]  of partnering in spreading his good news.
[1921.00 --> 1925.98]  I would love to invite this Mexico team forward now.
[1926.06 --> 1927.74]  So if you're heading down to Tijuana
[1927.74 --> 1929.58]  in six days or so,
[1929.86 --> 1930.82]  can you come up right now?
[1930.88 --> 1932.82]  We're going to kind of stand up in the front here
[1932.82 --> 1933.74]  in front of this chair.
[1934.30 --> 1936.34]  And you can make your way up here
[1936.34 --> 1938.06]  at this moment.
[1938.06 --> 1949.04]  There's two Hubert's missing
[1949.04 --> 1950.08]  and a Joey missing
[1950.08 --> 1951.72]  and a Hayden missing.
[1952.14 --> 1952.58]  Right?
[1952.74 --> 1953.68]  So that would be the ten.
[1954.36 --> 1955.96]  So here is your team,
[1956.12 --> 1958.44]  short, three youth and one small child.
[1960.78 --> 1962.06]  Following the apostles,
[1962.32 --> 1963.86]  the church is sent.
[1964.34 --> 1965.78]  You, Mexico team,
[1965.86 --> 1967.64]  are sent with the gospel of the kingdom
[1967.64 --> 1969.46]  to make disciples of all nations,
[1969.90 --> 1970.68]  to feed the hungry
[1970.68 --> 1972.26]  and to proclaim the assurance
[1972.26 --> 1973.72]  that in the name of Christ
[1973.72 --> 1975.02]  there is forgiveness of sin
[1975.02 --> 1976.66]  and a new life for all
[1976.66 --> 1977.80]  who repent and believe.
[1977.90 --> 1980.16]  And that charges for all of us as a church.
[1980.66 --> 1982.28]  In a world estranged from God
[1982.28 --> 1984.54]  where millions face confusing choices,
[1985.10 --> 1987.64]  this mission is central to our being.
[1987.64 --> 1990.58]  For we announce the one name that saves.
[1992.06 --> 1995.00]  You, now go to Tijuana and Rosarito
[1995.00 --> 1996.52]  and the extending area there,
[1996.52 --> 1997.98]  Mexico in that mission,
[1998.12 --> 1999.24]  with that gospel,
[1999.64 --> 2001.18]  in the power of the Spirit.
[2001.98 --> 2003.02]  May God bless you
[2003.02 --> 2004.24]  and all your work
[2004.24 --> 2005.20]  and relationship building.
[2005.62 --> 2007.06]  And may you see the labor,
[2007.20 --> 2008.56]  your labor in the Lord
[2008.56 --> 2009.74]  is not in vain.
[2011.62 --> 2013.16]  We're going to pray over them
[2013.16 --> 2014.76]  and we're going to do so
[2014.76 --> 2016.68]  by inviting family
[2016.68 --> 2017.90]  and elders,
[2018.78 --> 2019.08]  friends,
[2019.26 --> 2019.82]  youth leaders,
[2020.30 --> 2021.34]  whoever is moved,
[2021.50 --> 2022.30]  to come up
[2022.30 --> 2023.34]  and join them here,
[2023.34 --> 2024.74]  lay hands on them
[2024.74 --> 2026.68]  and send them out.
[2026.76 --> 2027.60]  So we're going to ask you guys
[2027.60 --> 2029.60]  just move kind of into the middle there,
[2030.66 --> 2031.54]  across the front.
[2031.62 --> 2032.44]  If you are family
[2032.44 --> 2034.32]  or elders,
[2034.46 --> 2035.74]  I encourage you to come forward
[2035.74 --> 2036.64]  and find someone,
[2036.74 --> 2037.28]  youth leaders,
[2037.68 --> 2039.02]  I encourage you to come forward,
[2039.50 --> 2040.12]  find someone,
[2040.38 --> 2042.40]  lay your hands on them
[2042.40 --> 2043.34]  during this time.
[2045.32 --> 2047.10]  If you are so moved,
[2047.28 --> 2048.50]  you may stay in your seats
[2048.50 --> 2049.98]  and then just hold your hand out
[2049.98 --> 2051.10]  as a sign also
[2051.10 --> 2052.86]  of laying your hand on them
[2052.86 --> 2053.76]  and supporting them.
[2055.60 --> 2057.12]  This turns into
[2057.12 --> 2058.86]  a really beautiful picture
[2058.86 --> 2059.84]  for us
[2059.84 --> 2062.14]  of the kind of support
[2062.14 --> 2062.96]  and encouragement
[2062.96 --> 2065.68]  that these members go with.
[2065.80 --> 2066.96]  There is a whole community
[2066.96 --> 2068.18]  of faith and family
[2068.18 --> 2069.08]  behind them
[2069.08 --> 2070.10]  as they go
[2070.10 --> 2071.62]  in the power of the Spirit.
[2072.04 --> 2074.48]  And so we pray for you today.
[2074.78 --> 2076.44]  We pray this blessing on you
[2076.44 --> 2077.50]  as you go.
[2077.50 --> 2082.94]  Holy God,
[2083.72 --> 2085.78]  we know that you are
[2085.78 --> 2087.52]  a sending God.
[2088.90 --> 2090.50]  Throughout the history
[2090.50 --> 2091.72]  of salvation,
[2092.20 --> 2093.38]  your work in the world
[2093.38 --> 2094.12]  has been accomplished
[2094.12 --> 2095.40]  by people you sent
[2095.40 --> 2096.78]  into new,
[2097.24 --> 2097.68]  strange,
[2097.86 --> 2099.34]  and exciting places.
[2100.72 --> 2102.64]  And we pray for this team
[2102.64 --> 2104.38]  that you are now sending.
[2104.38 --> 2106.76]  We thank you,
[2106.84 --> 2107.14]  Lord God,
[2107.18 --> 2107.82]  for the promise
[2107.82 --> 2109.02]  that as you send,
[2109.22 --> 2110.20]  you also go.
[2111.34 --> 2112.36]  You go with them
[2112.36 --> 2113.62]  in the power of the Spirit.
[2114.46 --> 2115.66]  And so fill them
[2115.66 --> 2116.62]  with your Spirit.
[2117.10 --> 2117.78]  Fill them
[2117.78 --> 2119.20]  with Holy Spirit power.
[2119.76 --> 2120.44]  Fill them
[2120.44 --> 2122.22]  with a deep sense
[2122.22 --> 2123.64]  and experience
[2123.64 --> 2125.00]  of your nearness
[2125.00 --> 2126.18]  in the days
[2126.18 --> 2127.34]  and weeks to come.
[2128.26 --> 2129.40]  For the conversations
[2129.40 --> 2130.92]  they are about to have,
[2131.04 --> 2131.48]  Lord God,
[2131.54 --> 2132.52]  we pray your blessing.
[2132.52 --> 2134.04]  for the people
[2134.04 --> 2135.54]  that they are about to meet,
[2135.66 --> 2137.12]  we pray your blessing.
[2138.22 --> 2139.18]  For the ministries
[2139.18 --> 2140.04]  and the individuals
[2140.04 --> 2141.24]  that they will connect with
[2141.24 --> 2141.92]  in Mexico,
[2142.34 --> 2143.54]  we pray your blessing.
[2144.56 --> 2146.68]  We pray for Abelino
[2146.68 --> 2147.54]  and Maria.
[2147.80 --> 2149.34]  We pray for Alejandro
[2149.34 --> 2149.92]  and Abel.
[2150.08 --> 2151.14]  We pray for Erica
[2151.14 --> 2152.74]  and for all of the youth
[2152.74 --> 2155.20]  that they will connect with
[2155.20 --> 2155.96]  and that they will do
[2155.96 --> 2157.32]  ministry with.
[2157.32 --> 2159.16]  We pray, Lord God,
[2159.22 --> 2159.72]  for Jody
[2159.72 --> 2160.78]  and for Uriel
[2160.78 --> 2161.92]  and for their family.
[2162.08 --> 2163.36]  We pray for the men
[2163.36 --> 2164.46]  who live in their home.
[2164.64 --> 2165.52]  We pray, Lord God,
[2165.96 --> 2166.86]  preach the gospel
[2166.86 --> 2168.16]  boldly into their hearts
[2168.16 --> 2170.08]  and transform their lives
[2170.08 --> 2170.80]  by the truth
[2170.80 --> 2172.46]  of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2173.96 --> 2174.86]  We pray, God,
[2174.92 --> 2175.44]  for all those
[2175.44 --> 2176.12]  who come alongside
[2176.12 --> 2176.90]  this team
[2176.90 --> 2177.86]  as translators,
[2178.02 --> 2179.28]  as helpers,
[2179.36 --> 2180.98]  as facilitators.
[2181.10 --> 2181.96]  We think of the Stretkas
[2181.96 --> 2182.76]  and the Fruins
[2182.76 --> 2184.22]  and the so many others
[2184.22 --> 2185.74]  with whom they will connect
[2185.74 --> 2187.32]  and spend the week.
[2187.44 --> 2189.70]  We pray a blessing on them.
[2191.72 --> 2192.58]  And Lord God,
[2192.66 --> 2194.62]  as this team now goes
[2194.62 --> 2196.36]  with whatever anxiety
[2196.36 --> 2197.22]  they may have
[2197.22 --> 2197.92]  about travel
[2197.92 --> 2199.84]  or about being in Tijuana,
[2200.04 --> 2200.86]  whatever anxieties
[2200.86 --> 2202.06]  their parents may have
[2202.06 --> 2203.04]  about doing the same
[2203.04 --> 2204.14]  or their family may have
[2204.14 --> 2205.18]  about doing that,
[2205.24 --> 2206.02]  we pray, Lord God,
[2206.06 --> 2206.78]  that they would go
[2206.78 --> 2207.94]  in the confidence
[2207.94 --> 2209.52]  that you are near them.
[2209.60 --> 2210.52]  And so, Lord God,
[2210.58 --> 2212.12]  in the name of Jesus Christ,
[2212.12 --> 2213.56]  bless them
[2213.56 --> 2214.76]  and keep them.
[2215.64 --> 2216.56]  Make your face
[2216.56 --> 2217.70]  to shine upon them
[2217.70 --> 2219.94]  and be gracious to them.
[2221.02 --> 2221.98]  Turn your face
[2221.98 --> 2222.60]  toward them
[2222.60 --> 2223.56]  and give them
[2223.56 --> 2224.60]  your peace,
[2224.86 --> 2225.28]  we pray,
[2225.56 --> 2226.54]  in Jesus' name.
[2227.10 --> 2228.00]  All God's people said,
[2228.72 --> 2229.28]  Amen.
[2232.48 --> 2233.56]  As you have seen,
[2233.72 --> 2235.24]  those who are going
[2235.24 --> 2236.32]  on this trip up front
[2236.32 --> 2238.38]  and in the pancake breakfast
[2238.38 --> 2239.32]  or the Mexico dinner,
[2239.86 --> 2240.58]  I encourage you
[2240.58 --> 2241.78]  following service today
[2241.78 --> 2242.94]  grab one of them,
[2243.08 --> 2243.90]  encourage them,
[2244.18 --> 2245.22]  connect with them
[2245.22 --> 2247.64]  and see what it is
[2247.64 --> 2248.74]  that they are excited about
[2248.74 --> 2249.82]  for this trip ahead.
[2251.12 --> 2251.98]  I'd like to invite
[2251.98 --> 2252.56]  the deacon
[2252.56 --> 2253.84]  who's going to do
[2253.84 --> 2254.90]  our offering announcement
[2254.90 --> 2255.58]  to the front.
[2255.94 --> 2256.32]  Thanks, Imo.
[2257.18 --> 2278.98]  Thank you.
[2278.98 --> 2284.74]  Got it?
[2285.30 --> 2286.12]  That's it.
[2286.32 --> 2286.76]  That's better.
[2287.98 --> 2288.98]  My name is Emo.
[2289.30 --> 2291.52]  I'm a deacon here at Emanuel.
[2292.62 --> 2297.70]  We continue our worship with the giving of our gifts for the budget,
[2297.70 --> 2302.42]  which covers the administration and ministries of our church.
[2302.42 --> 2309.22]  And the special offering this morning is for M2W2 prison mentorship.
[2310.38 --> 2314.70]  Many people in prison experience isolation and loneliness.
[2315.76 --> 2323.00]  An M2W2 mentor can provide a safe space for trust to grow and healing to occur.
[2323.92 --> 2327.56]  Our prison mentors bring companionship, accountability,
[2327.56 --> 2333.54]  and an outside perspective to folks in prison as well as prayer.
[2336.00 --> 2340.84]  Post-prison support, life after prison isn't easy.
[2341.66 --> 2348.74]  A 2019 study by Correctional Service Canada found that 23% of people leaving prison
[2348.74 --> 2351.26]  were reconvicted after two years.
[2351.26 --> 2359.44]  After five years, that number jumps to 38% and 60% for Indigenous men.
[2359.96 --> 2364.46]  So they have a program called NOLA.
[2364.98 --> 2366.72]  No one leaves alone.
[2367.26 --> 2373.82]  Offers post-incarceration support to participants based on their needs.
[2373.82 --> 2381.02]  Often, NOLA participants meet with a circle of volunteers and M2W2 staff.
[2382.02 --> 2386.90]  The circle provides mentorship and practical support in five areas.
[2387.44 --> 2391.90]  Housing, health, employment, education, and relationships.
[2393.06 --> 2398.80]  Alternatively, participants can choose to meet with a single volunteer or staff member
[2398.80 --> 2403.76]  on an as-needed basis to access support in these same areas.
[2404.84 --> 2409.82]  Participants in NOLA recognize the invaluable support it has provided.
[2410.74 --> 2412.10]  As one participant said,
[2412.16 --> 2417.28]  you try to rebuild your life in the community and you can't do it by yourself.
[2418.18 --> 2420.62]  NOLA cares and that's why it works.
[2421.24 --> 2422.72]  It makes a total difference.
[2422.72 --> 2430.28]  The Spirit of the Lord is on me because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor.
[2431.08 --> 2436.60]  He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind
[2436.60 --> 2439.40]  to set the oppressed free.
[2440.16 --> 2441.64]  Luke 4, verse 18.
[2442.74 --> 2449.20]  Next week's offering is for the Budget and Langley Emanuel Refugee Sponsorship Fund.
[2449.20 --> 2449.26]  Thank you.
[2452.72 --> 2475.56]  O kneel me down again
[2475.56 --> 2480.44]  Here at your feet
[2480.44 --> 2486.06]  Show me how much you love
[2486.06 --> 2489.00]  Humility
[2489.00 --> 2496.40]  O Spirit be the star
[2496.40 --> 2500.86]  That leads me to
[2500.86 --> 2506.74]  The humble heart of love
[2506.74 --> 2510.42]  I see in you
[2510.42 --> 2517.82]  Cause you are the God of the broken
[2517.82 --> 2522.44]  The friend of the weak
[2522.44 --> 2527.84]  And you wash the feet of the weary
[2527.84 --> 2532.04]  Embrace the ones in need
[2532.04 --> 2537.66]  And I want to be like you
[2537.66 --> 2541.44]  To have this heart in me
[2541.44 --> 2547.06]  You are the God of the humble
[2547.06 --> 2548.94]  You are the humble
[2548.94 --> 2553.00]  You are the humble King
[2553.00 --> 2558.62]  O kneel me down again
[2558.62 --> 2562.46]  Here at your feet
[2562.46 --> 2568.08]  Show me how much you love
[2568.08 --> 2568.98]  Show me how much you love
[2568.98 --> 2572.08]  Humanity
[2572.08 --> 2572.98]  Show me how much you love
[2572.98 --> 2574.08]  Humanity
[2574.08 --> 2576.02]  O Spirit be the star
[2576.02 --> 2583.42]  Let be the star that leads me to
[2583.42 --> 2584.04]  The humble heart of the humble
[2584.04 --> 2589.04]  The humble heart of love
[2589.04 --> 2589.66]  I see in you
[2589.66 --> 2592.66]  I see in you
[2592.66 --> 2594.66]  I see in you
[2594.66 --> 2596.66]  I see in you
[2596.66 --> 2599.28]  You are the God of the broken
[2599.28 --> 2603.06]  The friend of the weak
[2603.06 --> 2610.46]  And you wash the feet of the weary
[2610.46 --> 2612.46]  Embrace the ones in need
[2612.46 --> 2617.24]  And I want to be like you
[2617.24 --> 2618.72]  Jesus
[2618.72 --> 2622.46]  To have this heart in me
[2622.46 --> 2628.44]  You are the God of the humble
[2628.44 --> 2633.16]  You are the humble King
[2633.16 --> 2638.40]  You are the God of the humble
[2638.40 --> 2643.28]  You are the humble King
[2652.46 --> 2668.98]  Good morning
[2668.98 --> 2670.10]  My name is Eric
[2670.10 --> 2672.24]  I am one of the elders here at Emanuel
[2672.24 --> 2674.54]  A little bit of a schedule change kids
[2674.54 --> 2676.60]  Year up right after I do this prayer
[2676.60 --> 2678.70]  We will do children's worship this morning
[2678.70 --> 2683.24]  Before I do the family prayer
[2683.24 --> 2685.56]  One item that we found out this morning
[2685.56 --> 2687.32]  That Fran Skipper's dad
[2687.32 --> 2688.42]  Passed away suddenly
[2688.42 --> 2690.70]  Recently
[2690.70 --> 2691.34]  Yesterday
[2691.34 --> 2691.80]  Yeah
[2691.80 --> 2692.48]  Friday
[2692.48 --> 2692.94]  Friday
[2692.94 --> 2694.68]  So our thoughts and prayers
[2694.68 --> 2695.80]  Are out to you and your family
[2695.80 --> 2699.46]  Join me in prayer this morning
[2699.46 --> 2702.52]  Dear God
[2702.52 --> 2704.52]  What a wonderful morning
[2704.52 --> 2705.92]  And a day to wake up to
[2705.92 --> 2708.68]  Another chance to see the beauty
[2708.68 --> 2710.68]  Of this creation you have given us
[2710.68 --> 2712.80]  Thank you Lord
[2712.80 --> 2714.54]  For all the blessings you have given us
[2714.54 --> 2716.28]  When we take a moment Lord
[2716.28 --> 2716.92]  To reflect
[2716.92 --> 2718.40]  We can be grateful for living
[2718.40 --> 2719.48]  In this great country
[2719.48 --> 2720.56]  Province and city
[2720.56 --> 2722.60]  We thank you Lord
[2722.60 --> 2723.30]  For this church
[2723.30 --> 2724.26]  And the great community
[2724.26 --> 2725.40]  We have here at Emanuel
[2725.40 --> 2727.26]  Where this past week
[2727.26 --> 2728.32]  We could support classes
[2728.32 --> 2729.60]  Meetings and share together
[2729.60 --> 2731.40]  In our Wednesday prayer service
[2731.40 --> 2733.68]  We thank you Lord
[2733.68 --> 2735.06]  For this Mexico team
[2735.06 --> 2736.30]  That's heading off to Mexico
[2736.30 --> 2737.12]  In about a week
[2737.12 --> 2738.74]  We thank you for all those
[2738.74 --> 2739.72]  Who are volunteering
[2739.72 --> 2741.46]  And I ask that you would give them
[2741.46 --> 2742.60]  A great trip
[2742.60 --> 2744.40]  Where they can spread your word
[2744.40 --> 2745.58]  And be a witness to you
[2745.58 --> 2747.74]  But we know Lord
[2747.74 --> 2748.90]  That not all is perfect
[2748.90 --> 2750.60]  And that even in this family
[2750.60 --> 2751.72]  Of Emanuel
[2751.72 --> 2752.68]  We have concerns
[2752.68 --> 2753.88]  We want to bring to you
[2753.88 --> 2755.94]  We think of those among us
[2755.94 --> 2756.58]  That recently
[2756.58 --> 2758.24]  And over a longer period of time
[2758.24 --> 2760.28]  Mourn the death of loved ones
[2760.28 --> 2760.70]  And that
[2760.70 --> 2761.74]  How that absence
[2761.74 --> 2762.76]  In their life
[2762.76 --> 2763.72]  Is always present
[2763.72 --> 2765.68]  We think of those
[2765.68 --> 2766.20]  In our midst
[2766.20 --> 2766.88]  Who are suffering
[2766.88 --> 2767.52]  From physical
[2767.52 --> 2768.86]  And mental challenges
[2768.86 --> 2770.82]  There are those Lord
[2770.82 --> 2772.10]  Who struggle with pain
[2772.10 --> 2773.54]  Or discomfort every day
[2773.54 --> 2774.86]  And we want to bring
[2774.86 --> 2776.18]  Their concerns to you
[2776.18 --> 2778.30]  We also think of
[2778.30 --> 2778.88]  Sai Visser
[2778.88 --> 2779.98]  Who is also going through
[2779.98 --> 2781.16]  Treatment for lung cancer
[2781.16 --> 2781.78]  At this time
[2781.78 --> 2782.38]  And we ask
[2782.38 --> 2783.84]  For prayers for him
[2783.84 --> 2786.86]  Lord as we wake up
[2786.86 --> 2787.86]  To this beautiful morning
[2787.86 --> 2788.52]  We are aware
[2788.52 --> 2789.78]  That there is much strife
[2789.78 --> 2790.22]  And pain
[2790.22 --> 2791.60]  In many parts of this world
[2791.60 --> 2793.52]  We pray for those in Ukraine
[2793.52 --> 2794.14]  Russia
[2794.14 --> 2795.04]  Turkey
[2795.04 --> 2795.82]  And Syria
[2795.82 --> 2797.68]  Just to name a few places
[2797.68 --> 2798.40]  That are forefront
[2798.40 --> 2799.50]  In the news right now
[2799.50 --> 2801.58]  We pray for peace
[2801.58 --> 2802.62]  And we pray for those
[2802.62 --> 2803.56]  Helping hands
[2803.56 --> 2804.16]  That are working
[2804.16 --> 2805.06]  To help those
[2805.06 --> 2806.38]  Who are in need
[2806.38 --> 2808.28]  And who can offer hope
[2808.28 --> 2809.14]  To these people
[2809.14 --> 2812.16]  Lord we take comfort
[2812.16 --> 2812.72]  In the words
[2812.72 --> 2813.74]  That we read in the Bible
[2813.74 --> 2815.88]  The words from Psalm 121
[2815.88 --> 2816.96]  Offer this comfort
[2816.96 --> 2819.16]  I lift up my eyes
[2819.16 --> 2819.92]  To the mountains
[2819.92 --> 2821.38]  Where does my help
[2821.38 --> 2822.02]  Come from
[2822.02 --> 2824.52]  My help comes from the Lord
[2824.52 --> 2825.92]  The maker of heaven and earth
[2825.92 --> 2828.04]  He will not let your foot slip
[2828.04 --> 2829.88]  He who watches over you
[2829.88 --> 2830.74]  Will not slumber
[2830.74 --> 2832.84]  He who watches over us
[2832.84 --> 2834.34]  Will neither slumber nor sleep
[2834.34 --> 2836.54]  The Lord watches over you
[2836.54 --> 2838.18]  The Lord is your shade
[2838.18 --> 2838.98]  At your right hand
[2838.98 --> 2841.12]  The sun will not harm you by day
[2841.12 --> 2842.22]  Nor the moon by night
[2842.22 --> 2843.84]  The Lord will keep you
[2843.84 --> 2844.62]  From all harm
[2844.62 --> 2846.42]  He will watch over your life
[2846.42 --> 2848.12]  The Lord will watch over
[2848.12 --> 2849.18]  Your coming and going
[2849.18 --> 2850.76]  Both now and forevermore
[2850.76 --> 2852.78]  Thank you Lord
[2852.78 --> 2854.14]  For these comforting words
[2854.14 --> 2855.28]  As we go into the world
[2855.28 --> 2855.88]  This week
[2855.88 --> 2857.14]  Being lights for you
[2857.14 --> 2858.00]  Amen
[2858.00 --> 2861.90]  Hey children
[2861.90 --> 2862.96]  Come on up
[2862.96 --> 2864.82]  For some kids corner time
[2864.82 --> 2868.86]  Oh that's my spot
[2868.86 --> 2869.32]  I think
[2869.32 --> 2871.32]  You guys gotta move out
[2871.32 --> 2871.78]  Move out
[2871.78 --> 2872.46]  Move out
[2872.46 --> 2879.72]  How are the kids doing this morning
[2879.72 --> 2881.00]  Alright
[2881.00 --> 2883.68]  I wasn't here last week
[2883.68 --> 2884.64]  But I heard you guys
[2884.64 --> 2885.56]  Had a little bit of fun
[2885.56 --> 2887.22]  Talking about perseverance
[2887.22 --> 2888.44]  Does anybody remember
[2888.44 --> 2889.28]  That lesson that
[2889.28 --> 2891.00]  Mrs. Lobert was teaching you about
[2891.00 --> 2891.70]  I wonder if
[2891.70 --> 2892.58]  Did you guys do some
[2892.58 --> 2893.36]  Fun activity
[2893.36 --> 2893.86]  That I think
[2893.86 --> 2894.90]  I kind of would like
[2894.90 --> 2895.58]  To be part of
[2895.58 --> 2896.12]  What was it
[2896.12 --> 2896.78]  What were you doing
[2896.78 --> 2899.00]  Burpee competition
[2899.00 --> 2901.02]  Alright
[2901.02 --> 2902.20]  How did it go
[2902.20 --> 2903.50]  Right on
[2903.50 --> 2904.86]  Awesome
[2904.86 --> 2906.58]  I like doing that
[2906.58 --> 2907.22]  Kind of stuff too
[2907.22 --> 2907.96]  So maybe you and me
[2907.96 --> 2908.84]  Are gonna go at it later
[2908.84 --> 2909.62]  How do you feel
[2909.62 --> 2910.00]  Yeah
[2910.00 --> 2911.98]  Today we're gonna talk
[2911.98 --> 2912.96]  About something different
[2912.96 --> 2914.58]  In children's worship time
[2914.58 --> 2915.56]  Have any of you guys
[2915.56 --> 2917.02]  Ever been sad before
[2917.02 --> 2917.60]  Yeah
[2917.60 --> 2918.20]  Yeah
[2918.20 --> 2919.00]  Like maybe
[2919.00 --> 2919.98]  Let me give me some examples
[2919.98 --> 2921.04]  Like maybe like a
[2921.04 --> 2923.44]  Pet is sick
[2923.44 --> 2924.38]  Or someone
[2924.38 --> 2925.92]  A friend of yours is sick
[2925.92 --> 2927.20]  Or somebody's mean to you
[2927.20 --> 2928.38]  You're sad
[2928.38 --> 2929.10]  Or somebody maybe
[2929.10 --> 2929.96]  Passes away
[2929.96 --> 2930.86]  That could be too
[2930.86 --> 2932.80]  What do you do
[2932.80 --> 2933.74]  When you're sad
[2933.74 --> 2934.76]  What are some things you do
[2934.76 --> 2935.80]  Does anybody got an idea
[2935.80 --> 2936.06]  For me
[2936.06 --> 2936.46]  What do you do
[2936.46 --> 2936.98]  When you're sad
[2936.98 --> 2940.72]  Sometimes cry
[2940.72 --> 2941.44]  What do you do

[3002.16 --> 3003.28]  We're gonna talk more
[3003.28 --> 3005.06]  About how God
[3005.06 --> 3005.88]  Can take care of us
[3005.88 --> 3006.54]  When we're sad

[3018.38 --> 3027.76]  Thanks Eric
[3027.76 --> 3043.08]  I wonder if Mr. Eric
[3043.08 --> 3043.92]  Knows that we have
[3043.92 --> 3045.22]  That exact same stuffy
[3045.22 --> 3045.74]  In the nursery
[3045.74 --> 3046.58]  Here at church
[3046.58 --> 3054.92]  We're gonna
[3054.92 --> 3056.96]  Continue in our series
[3056.96 --> 3059.02]  Through the book of Romans
[3059.02 --> 3061.10]  We're gonna read
[3061.10 --> 3061.98]  This morning together
[3061.98 --> 3063.76]  From Romans 5
[3063.76 --> 3065.28]  The first 11 verses
[3065.28 --> 3066.32]  It will be on the screen
[3066.32 --> 3067.96]  Over my shoulder there
[3067.96 --> 3069.12]  I encourage you
[3069.12 --> 3069.72]  To have a Bible
[3069.72 --> 3070.38]  Open it up
[3070.38 --> 3071.86]  And keep it open
[3071.86 --> 3073.38]  As we'll make reference
[3073.38 --> 3074.20]  Throughout
[3074.20 --> 3078.38]  Before we read
[3078.38 --> 3078.84]  This morning
[3078.84 --> 3080.18]  I'd just like to pray
[3080.18 --> 3080.84]  Together
[3080.84 --> 3088.44]  Heavenly Father
[3088.44 --> 3089.26]  We come now
[3089.26 --> 3091.24]  To your word
[3091.24 --> 3094.50]  And we ask
[3094.50 --> 3094.86]  Lord
[3094.86 --> 3095.52]  That you would
[3095.52 --> 3098.00]  Take these truths
[3098.00 --> 3099.70]  And plant them
[3099.70 --> 3100.84]  Deep into
[3100.84 --> 3102.50]  Our hearts
[3102.50 --> 3105.10]  Take these truths
[3105.10 --> 3106.14]  And transform
[3106.14 --> 3107.42]  Our minds
[3107.42 --> 3108.58]  And imaginations
[3108.58 --> 3109.60]  By them
[3109.60 --> 3110.68]  So that we can
[3110.68 --> 3111.28]  See you
[3111.28 --> 3112.00]  More clearly
[3112.00 --> 3112.48]  At work
[3112.48 --> 3113.42]  In our lives
[3113.42 --> 3114.60]  And in the world
[3114.60 --> 3115.76]  Through your church
[3115.76 --> 3119.70]  God we pray
[3119.70 --> 3120.52]  That we would
[3120.52 --> 3121.36]  Hear today
[3121.36 --> 3122.06]  The voice
[3122.06 --> 3122.76]  Of Jesus
[3122.76 --> 3124.86]  And we would
[3124.86 --> 3125.62]  Give him praise
[3125.62 --> 3127.38]  In your name
[3127.38 --> 3127.72]  Alone
[3127.72 --> 3129.36]  Amen
[3129.36 --> 3136.66]  We're gonna read
[3136.66 --> 3138.16]  Romans 5
[3138.16 --> 3139.38]  Starting at verse 1
[3139.38 --> 3142.82]  Paul writes
[3142.82 --> 3143.74]  Therefore
[3143.74 --> 3146.12]  Since we have been
[3146.12 --> 3147.60]  Justified through faith
[3147.60 --> 3149.14]  We have peace
[3149.14 --> 3149.82]  With God
[3149.82 --> 3150.74]  Through our
[3150.74 --> 3152.48]  Lord Jesus Christ
[3152.48 --> 3153.84]  Through whom
[3153.84 --> 3155.08]  We have gained access
[3155.08 --> 3155.96]  By faith
[3155.96 --> 3157.08]  Into this grace
[3157.08 --> 3158.22]  In which we
[3158.22 --> 3159.08]  Now stand
[3159.08 --> 3160.90]  And we boast
[3160.90 --> 3161.66]  In the hope
[3161.66 --> 3162.70]  Of the glory
[3162.70 --> 3163.86]  Of God
[3163.86 --> 3166.44]  Not only so
[3166.44 --> 3167.40]  But we also
[3167.40 --> 3168.48]  Glory in our
[3168.48 --> 3169.20]  Sufferings
[3169.20 --> 3170.34]  Because we know
[3170.34 --> 3171.22]  That suffering
[3171.22 --> 3171.94]  Produces
[3171.94 --> 3172.98]  Perseverance
[3172.98 --> 3174.16]  Perseverance
[3174.16 --> 3174.84]  Character
[3174.84 --> 3175.86]  And character
[3175.86 --> 3176.78]  Hope
[3176.78 --> 3179.00]  And hope
[3179.00 --> 3180.20]  Does not put us
[3180.20 --> 3180.84]  To shame
[3180.84 --> 3182.68]  Because God's
[3182.68 --> 3183.30]  Love has been
[3183.30 --> 3183.82]  Poured out
[3183.82 --> 3184.86]  Into our hearts
[3184.86 --> 3186.14]  Through the Holy Spirit
[3186.14 --> 3187.20]  Who has been
[3187.20 --> 3188.06]  Given to us
[3188.06 --> 3189.82]  You see
[3189.82 --> 3191.26]  At just the right
[3191.26 --> 3192.06]  Time
[3192.06 --> 3193.30]  When we were
[3193.30 --> 3194.30]  Still powerless
[3194.30 --> 3195.80]  Christ died
[3195.80 --> 3197.14]  For the ungodly
[3197.14 --> 3198.84]  Very rarely
[3198.84 --> 3199.74]  Will anyone die
[3199.74 --> 3200.44]  For a righteous
[3200.44 --> 3201.02]  Person
[3201.02 --> 3202.00]  Though for a
[3202.00 --> 3202.60]  Good person
[3202.60 --> 3203.42]  Someone might
[3203.42 --> 3204.38]  Possibly dare
[3204.38 --> 3204.98]  To die
[3204.98 --> 3206.10]  But God
[3206.10 --> 3207.06]  Demonstrates
[3207.06 --> 3207.86]  His love
[3207.86 --> 3209.04]  For us
[3209.04 --> 3210.04]  In this
[3210.04 --> 3211.84]  While we
[3211.84 --> 3212.76]  Were still
[3212.76 --> 3213.50]  Sinners
[3213.50 --> 3214.46]  Christ
[3214.46 --> 3215.40]  Died
[3215.40 --> 3216.50]  For us
[3216.50 --> 3219.36]  Since we
[3219.36 --> 3219.82]  Have now
[3219.82 --> 3220.52]  Been justified
[3220.52 --> 3221.52]  By his blood
[3221.52 --> 3222.48]  How much more
[3222.48 --> 3223.40]  Shall we be
[3223.40 --> 3224.20]  Saved from
[3224.20 --> 3225.00]  God's wrath
[3225.00 --> 3225.88]  Through him
[3225.88 --> 3227.60]  For if
[3227.60 --> 3228.44]  While we
[3228.44 --> 3229.24]  Were God's
[3229.24 --> 3229.88]  Enemies
[3229.88 --> 3230.30]  We were
[3230.30 --> 3231.28]  Reconciled to
[3231.28 --> 3231.88]  Him through
[3231.88 --> 3232.32]  The death
[3232.32 --> 3232.96]  Of his son
[3232.96 --> 3234.28]  How much more
[3234.28 --> 3235.26]  Having been
[3235.26 --> 3236.20]  Reconciled
[3236.20 --> 3237.08]  Shall we be
[3237.08 --> 3237.84]  Saved
[3237.84 --> 3238.78]  Through his
[3238.78 --> 3239.56]  Life
[3239.56 --> 3241.74]  Not only
[3241.74 --> 3242.52]  Is this
[3242.52 --> 3243.12]  So
[3243.12 --> 3243.72]  But we
[3243.72 --> 3244.44]  Also boast
[3244.44 --> 3245.02]  In God
[3245.02 --> 3245.56]  Through our
[3245.56 --> 3246.30]  Lord Jesus
[3246.30 --> 3246.82]  Christ
[3246.82 --> 3247.60]  Through whom
[3247.60 --> 3248.14]  We have
[3248.14 --> 3249.26]  Now received
[3249.26 --> 3250.70]  Reconciliation
[3250.70 --> 3252.64]  This is the
[3252.64 --> 3253.04]  Word of the
[3253.04 --> 3253.28]  Lord
[3253.28 --> 3261.86]  One of the
[3261.86 --> 3262.60]  Things that I
[3262.60 --> 3262.94]  Am
[3262.94 --> 3265.20]  Aware of
[3265.20 --> 3265.74]  As we work
[3265.74 --> 3266.10]  Our way
[3266.10 --> 3266.92]  Through the
[3266.92 --> 3267.34]  Book of
[3267.34 --> 3267.88]  Revelation
[3267.88 --> 3269.70]  Is that
[3269.70 --> 3270.88]  There is
[3270.88 --> 3271.84]  Lots of
[3271.84 --> 3272.78]  Opportunity
[3272.78 --> 3273.40]  Here to
[3273.40 --> 3274.16]  Discuss
[3274.16 --> 3276.26]  Deep and
[3276.26 --> 3277.92]  Difficult
[3277.92 --> 3279.06]  Doctrine
[3279.06 --> 3280.60]  Ideas
[3280.60 --> 3281.64]  About who
[3281.64 --> 3282.44]  God is
[3282.44 --> 3283.12]  And what
[3283.12 --> 3283.90]  He is doing
[3283.90 --> 3284.40]  In the
[3284.40 --> 3284.70]  World
[3284.70 --> 3285.64]  Through Jesus
[3285.64 --> 3286.10]  Christ
[3286.10 --> 3286.68]  And where
[3286.68 --> 3287.22]  History
[3287.22 --> 3288.34]  Is ultimately
[3288.34 --> 3288.84]  Headed
[3288.84 --> 3290.26]  And I
[3290.26 --> 3291.00]  Know that
[3291.00 --> 3292.58]  For myself
[3292.58 --> 3294.28]  The temptation
[3294.28 --> 3295.64]  When discussing
[3295.64 --> 3296.32]  These things
[3296.32 --> 3297.14]  Of doctrine
[3297.14 --> 3297.80]  Is to
[3297.80 --> 3298.64]  Sort of
[3298.64 --> 3299.58]  Stay really
[3299.58 --> 3300.24]  Heady
[3300.24 --> 3301.84]  And intellectual
[3301.84 --> 3303.10]  And to
[3303.10 --> 3304.24]  Wrestle with
[3304.24 --> 3305.12]  These things
[3305.12 --> 3305.98]  At an almost
[3305.98 --> 3306.66]  Academic
[3306.66 --> 3307.42]  Level
[3307.42 --> 3309.50]  What I
[3309.50 --> 3309.82]  Would like
[3309.82 --> 3310.86]  Us to
[3310.86 --> 3312.06]  Remember
[3312.06 --> 3313.52]  And see
[3313.52 --> 3314.24]  This morning
[3314.24 --> 3314.70]  As we
[3314.70 --> 3315.10]  Begin
[3315.10 --> 3316.00]  Because we
[3316.00 --> 3316.12]  Are going
[3316.12 --> 3316.32]  To do
[3316.32 --> 3316.70]  Some more
[3316.70 --> 3317.26]  Doctrine
[3317.26 --> 3317.80]  Work
[3317.80 --> 3318.42]  Today
[3318.42 --> 3320.78]  Is that
[3320.78 --> 3322.66]  All
[3322.66 --> 3324.12]  Good
[3324.12 --> 3325.58]  Theology
[3325.58 --> 3327.34]  Leads
[3327.34 --> 3327.92]  To
[3327.92 --> 3328.82]  Doxology
[3328.82 --> 3330.88]  Right
[3330.88 --> 3331.48]  So all
[3331.48 --> 3331.86]  Good
[3331.86 --> 3332.66]  Theology
[3332.66 --> 3333.14]  That is
[3333.14 --> 3334.16]  The study
[3334.16 --> 3334.94]  And knowing
[3334.94 --> 3335.60]  Of God
[3335.60 --> 3335.94]  And His
[3335.94 --> 3336.26]  Word
[3336.26 --> 3337.16]  Leads to
[3337.16 --> 3338.06]  Doxology
[3338.06 --> 3338.62]  Which is
[3338.62 --> 3339.46]  Words of
[3339.46 --> 3340.36]  Glorifying
[3340.36 --> 3340.84]  Which is
[3340.84 --> 3341.52]  Singing
[3341.52 --> 3342.44]  Praise
[3342.44 --> 3343.30]  And in
[3343.30 --> 3343.54]  Fact
[3343.54 --> 3344.22]  Case in
[3344.22 --> 3344.52]  Point
[3344.52 --> 3344.84]  If your
[3344.84 --> 3345.08]  Bibles
[3345.08 --> 3345.50]  Are still
[3345.50 --> 3345.86]  Open
[3345.86 --> 3347.86]  You can
[3347.86 --> 3348.38]  Flip over
[3348.38 --> 3348.68]  To the
[3348.68 --> 3349.00]  End of
[3349.00 --> 3349.74]  Chapter 11
[3349.74 --> 3350.60]  In Romans
[3350.60 --> 3350.94]  And we'll
[3350.94 --> 3351.30]  Get there
[3351.30 --> 3351.74]  Eventually
[3351.74 --> 3352.14]  But just
[3352.14 --> 3352.54]  To see
[3352.54 --> 3352.78]  It
[3352.78 --> 3353.64]  Paul has
[3353.64 --> 3354.06]  Done the
[3354.06 --> 3354.36]  First
[3354.36 --> 3355.64]  11 chapters
[3355.64 --> 3356.22]  Of Romans
[3356.22 --> 3356.58]  In this
[3356.58 --> 3356.90]  Deep
[3356.90 --> 3357.42]  Strict
