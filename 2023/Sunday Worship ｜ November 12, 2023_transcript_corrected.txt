[90.00 → 119.98] Thank you.
[120.00 → 149.98] Thank you.
[150.00 → 179.98] Thank you.
[180.00 → 182.00] Thank you.
[182.00 → 196.28] Good morning.
[196.28 → 198.28] Thank you.
[198.28 → 200.28] Thank you.
[200.28 → 202.28] Thank you.
[202.28 → 204.28] Thank you.
[204.28 → 206.28] Thank you.
[206.28 → 208.28] Thank you.
[208.28 → 210.28] Thank you.
[210.28 → 212.28] Thank you.
[212.28 → 214.28] Thank you.
[214.28 → 216.28] Thank you.
[216.28 → 218.28] There it is.
[218.28 → 220.28] There it is.
[220.28 → 222.28] There we go.
[222.28 → 224.28] Good morning.
[224.28 → 226.28] Thanks for bearing with us as we figure out these fun technical issues.
[226.28 → 228.28] Welcome to Langley Emanuel.
[228.28 → 232.28] A special welcome if you are visiting with us this morning.
[232.28 → 234.28] We are grateful that you are here.
[234.28 → 236.28] We are grateful that you are here.
[236.28 → 246.28] We are grateful that we get to gather as a body of believers, as a group of questioners, as a group of people seeking understanding in our faith.
[246.28 → 250.28] We are grateful to be together to be together to be together to be met by God in this time and space.
[250.28 → 252.28] We are grateful that we are here to be together to be met by God in this time and space.
[252.28 → 256.28] We are going to worship in song and in word, but we will gather at the table together this morning.
[256.28 → 263.28] And so, already now, continue and be ready, preparing your hearts to meet God there and be met by Him.
[263.28 → 267.28] Before we begin, in earnest, we have a couple of announcements.
[267.28 → 272.28] So, I am going to invite Josh up to the front, who is going to make an announcement for the Young Adult Ministry.
[272.28 → 274.28] Hello.
[274.28 → 277.28] Sorry, that was so much louder than I wanted it to be.
[277.28 → 284.28] I just want to let you all know, young adults, by popular demand, today we are heading to the zoo.
[284.28 → 290.28] So, we will be meeting at the entrance to the zoo at 1 p.m.
[290.28 → 291.28] I just want to let you all know.
[291.28 → 292.28] Thank you.
[292.28 → 293.28] Bye.
[293.28 → 303.28] I am not sure what Josh's laughter at going to the zoo indicates what he thinks about going to the zoo, but that sounds like fun.
[303.28 → 307.28] And, if I read the forecast correct, maybe the rain will hold off just long enough.
[307.28 → 309.28] It doesn't start raining until 4.
[309.28 → 311.28] It doesn't start raining until 4.
[311.28 → 312.28] Josh has spoken.
[312.28 → 314.28] Thus spoke Josh.
[314.28 → 322.28] As well, on December 1st, there is a winter holiday.
[322.28 → 326.28] There is a women's Christmas dinner event happening.
[326.28 → 330.28] If you are interested in participating in that, there is a sign-up table at the back.
[330.28 → 334.28] There will be people there following our worship together.
[334.28 → 335.28] You can grab them and ask questions.
[335.28 → 344.28] They are also, I think, still looking for a couple tables, table designers, table makers to sign up.
[344.28 → 352.28] And so, talk to them about that, if that's a special skill you have or an opportunity that you would like to serve.
[352.28 → 354.28] I am going to invite you to stand.
[354.28 → 356.28] As we are met by God in this place.
[356.28 → 360.28] And we mark that by receiving his greeting.
[360.28 → 364.28] And so, maybe you want to hold your hands out as a posture reflecting that.
[364.28 → 366.28] Maybe you want to close your eyes.
[366.28 → 370.28] Maybe you want to just bask in the words of God spoken over you.
[370.28 → 373.28] Receive the greeting of our God.
[373.28 → 377.28] Grace, mercy, and peace to you.
[377.28 → 378.28] From God our Father.
[378.28 → 381.28] From the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son and our Saviour.
[381.28 → 384.28] Through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[384.28 → 385.28] Amen.
[385.28 → 386.28] Amen.
[386.28 → 392.28] As God has welcomed us, I am going to invite you to turn to those around and welcome them into worship as well.
[392.28 → 393.28] Thank you.
[422.28 → 432.28] Our call to worship this morning comes from Philippians 2.
[432.28 → 440.28] Therefore, God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name.
[440.28 → 447.28] That at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth.
[447.28 → 454.28] And every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.
[454.28 → 460.28] Let's join our voices and worship our Lord and Saviour.
[460.28 → 467.28] Jesus, hope of the nations.
[467.28 → 475.28] Jesus, comfort for all who mourn.
[475.28 → 480.28] Jesus, hope of the nations.
[480.28 → 489.28] Jesus, comfort for all who mourn.
[489.28 → 496.28] Jesus, Lord, you are the source of heaven's hope on earth.
[496.28 → 502.28] Jesus, light in the darkness.
[502.28 → 507.28] Jesus, strength in His circumstance.
[507.28 → 514.28] You are the source of heaven's hope on earth.
[514.28 → 519.28] In history you lived and died.
[519.28 → 525.28] You broke the chains you rose to life.
[525.28 → 531.28] You are the source of heaven's hope on earth.
[531.28 → 535.28] You are the source of heaven's hope on earth.
[535.28 → 536.28] You are the Son of God.
[536.28 → 540.28] You are the Son of God.
[540.28 → 545.20] Heroes from the desert
[545.20 → 547.40] Conquering fear
[547.40 → 549.68] Our prince of peace
[549.68 → 551.82] Drawing us in
[551.82 → 554.12] Jesus our hope
[554.12 → 558.46] Living for all who will receive
[558.46 → 562.88] Lord we believe
[570.28 → 575.54] Jesus hope of the nations
[575.54 → 581.42] Jesus hope for all who mourn
[581.42 → 585.32] You are the source of heavens
[585.32 → 588.66] All on earth
[588.66 → 592.78] Jesus light in the darkness
[592.78 → 597.62] Jesus truth in any circumstance
[597.62 → 603.00] You are the source of heavens
[603.00 → 605.54] Life on earth
[605.54 → 610.14] In history you lived and died
[610.14 → 612.74] You broke the chain
[612.74 → 614.92] You rose to life
[614.92 → 618.00] You are the hope
[618.00 → 620.16] Living in us
[620.16 → 622.14] You are the rock
[622.14 → 624.42] In whom we trust
[624.42 → 626.64] You are the light
[626.64 → 632.02] Shining for all the world to see
[632.02 → 634.56] Heroes from the desert
[634.56 → 636.56] Conquering fear
[636.56 → 639.60] Our prince of peace
[639.60 → 641.56] Drawing us near
[641.56 → 643.80] Jesus our hope
[643.80 → 648.10] Living for all who will receive
[648.10 → 652.48] Lord we believe
[652.48 → 656.48] Lord we believe
[656.48 → 661.02] Lord we believe
[661.02 → 674.94] In the bleak midwinter
[674.94 → 692.32] All creation grows
[692.32 → 696.86] For a world in darkness
[696.86 → 700.24] Frozen like a stone
[700.24 → 703.24] Light is breaking
[703.24 → 708.78] In a stable for our throne
[708.78 → 712.16] And he shall reign
[712.16 → 714.16] Forever more
[714.16 → 716.16] Forever more
[716.16 → 717.70] Forever more
[717.70 → 721.16] And he shall reign
[721.16 → 723.16] Forever more
[723.16 → 725.16] Forever more
[725.16 → 726.16] Forever more
[726.16 → 730.16] Unto us a child is born
[730.16 → 731.54] The king of kings
[731.54 → 732.94] The king of kings
[732.94 → 734.86] And lord of lords
[734.86 → 737.66] And his shall reign
[737.66 → 739.08] Forever more
[739.08 → 741.08] Forever more
[741.08 → 761.46] If I were a wise man
[761.46 → 764.84] I would travel far
[764.84 → 768.84] If I were a shepherd
[768.84 → 772.58] I would do my part
[772.58 → 775.84] As far as I am
[775.84 → 780.30] I will give to him my heart
[780.30 → 781.30] And his shall reign
[781.30 → 783.60] And his shall reign
[783.60 → 785.42] Forever more
[785.42 → 787.30] Forever more
[787.30 → 791.18] And his shall reign
[791.18 → 793.08] Forever more
[793.08 → 795.30] Forever more
[795.30 → 799.52] Unto us a child is born
[799.52 → 801.62] The king of kings
[801.62 → 803.32] And lord of lords
[803.32 → 806.24] And his shall reign
[806.24 → 808.08] Forever more
[808.08 → 811.08] Forever more
[811.08 → 811.20] Forever more
[811.20 → 822.00] And the nature lies
[822.00 → 823.80] The one who made
[823.80 → 825.54] The starry sky
[825.54 → 829.22] May be born for sacrifice
[829.22 → 831.98] Christ our Messiah
[831.98 → 834.88] Into our hopes
[834.88 → 836.66] Into our fears
[836.66 → 839.34] The saviour of the world
[839.34 → 840.22] The world appears
[840.22 → 844.04] The promise of eternal years
[844.04 → 846.62] Christ our Messiah
[846.62 → 850.32] And his shall reign
[850.32 → 852.20] Forever more
[852.20 → 854.54] Forever more
[854.54 → 857.64] And he shall reign
[857.64 → 859.42] Forever more
[859.42 → 861.94] Forever more
[861.94 → 864.94] And he shall reign
[864.94 → 866.72] Forever more
[866.72 → 868.94] Forever more
[868.94 → 872.10] And he shall reign
[872.10 → 873.94] Forever more
[873.94 → 875.94] Forever more
[875.94 → 880.10] Unto us a child is born
[880.10 → 882.10] The king of kings
[882.10 → 883.72] The lord of lords
[883.72 → 885.94] And he shall reign
[885.94 → 888.16] Forever more
[888.16 → 889.94] Forever more
[889.94 → 892.94] And he shall reign
[892.94 → 893.94] Forever more
[893.94 → 894.94] Forever more
[894.94 → 896.94] Forever more
[896.94 → 899.94] And he shall reign
[899.94 → 901.94] Forever more
[901.94 → 902.94] Forever more
[902.94 → 904.94] Forever more
[904.94 → 908.18] I invite you to be seated.
[908.18 → 914.14] As an assurance of forgiveness
[914.14 → 916.74] We're going to sing
[916.74 → 918.12] Come Thou Fount
[918.12 → 919.56] In a moment
[919.56 → 920.70] But before we do
[920.70 → 922.26] I wanted to talk about
[922.26 → 922.88] The lyrics
[922.88 → 925.24] Sometimes we sing a song
[925.24 → 925.90] So often
[925.90 → 927.34] We are not impacted
[927.34 → 928.30] By the words anymore
[928.30 → 930.00] In the first verse
[930.00 → 930.88] We're asking God
[930.88 → 931.68] To teach us
[931.68 → 932.60] His song
[932.60 → 933.76] Of never ending grace
[933.76 → 937.22] We are to look at
[937.22 → 937.98] What God has done
[937.98 → 938.54] For us
[938.54 → 939.76] His mercy
[939.76 → 940.60] Which is new
[940.60 → 941.20] Every morning
[941.20 → 944.10] And we are to respond
[944.10 → 944.96] With songs
[944.96 → 946.06] Of loudest praise
[946.06 → 949.36] We are a forgetful people
[949.36 → 950.42] And we need
[950.42 → 951.92] A constant reminder
[951.92 → 953.20] To recalibrate
[953.20 → 953.72] Our hearts
[953.72 → 954.96] To sing this tune
[954.96 → 957.08] To be reminded
[957.08 → 958.60] Of his redeeming love
[958.60 → 959.56] That it was demonstrated
[959.56 → 960.28] On the mount
[960.28 → 961.34] The mount of Calvary
[961.34 → 962.54] Calvary where Jesus
[962.54 → 963.28] Was crucified
[963.28 → 964.96] And the assurance
[964.96 → 965.56] Is this
[965.56 → 967.14] That we are fixed
[967.14 → 968.14] Upon that very mount
[968.14 → 968.78] Of Calvary
[968.78 → 970.56] We are held fast
[970.56 → 971.76] To this vast love
[971.76 → 972.46] That seeks
[972.46 → 973.78] To shower affection
[973.78 → 974.28] On us
[974.28 → 974.76] Despite
[974.76 → 976.56] What we do
[976.56 → 979.32] In the second verse
[979.32 → 980.78] We see the word
[980.78 → 981.50] Ebenezer
[981.50 → 983.28] Which is referring
[983.28 → 984.20] To the stone
[984.20 → 985.16] Of help
[985.16 → 986.52] From 1 Samuel
[986.52 → 987.26] Where Samuel
[987.26 → 988.56] Set this stone
[988.56 → 989.48] As a reminder
[989.48 → 991.68] That it was God
[991.68 → 992.40] Who carried
[992.40 → 993.06] The Israelites
[993.06 → 994.46] Through all their troubles
[994.46 → 996.04] And brought them
[996.04 → 997.30] To where they are now
[997.30 → 999.70] Faith is a journey
[999.70 → 1001.74] And in every step
[1001.74 → 1003.98] We raise our own stones
[1003.98 → 1005.24] Of remembrance
[1005.24 → 1006.96] Acknowledging
[1006.96 → 1008.82] The faithfulness of God
[1008.82 → 1010.04] In our lives
[1010.04 → 1012.54] In our moments of doubt
[1012.54 → 1013.78] And uncertainty
[1013.78 → 1016.00] Even in our wandering
[1016.00 → 1018.56] Jesus seeks us out
[1018.56 → 1020.08] And brings us back
[1020.08 → 1021.60] To the fold of God
[1021.60 → 1023.24] Each day
[1023.24 → 1023.26] Each day
[1023.26 → 1023.28] Each day
[1023.28 → 1023.56] Each day
[1023.56 → 1023.68] Each day
[1023.68 → 1024.68] We find ourselves
[1024.68 → 1025.58] Desperately
[1025.58 → 1026.46] In need
[1026.46 → 1027.62] Of God's grace
[1027.62 → 1030.22] In the third verse
[1030.22 → 1031.86] We see this word
[1031.86 → 1032.42] Fetter
[1032.42 → 1034.50] Which is another word
[1034.50 → 1035.14] For chain
[1035.14 → 1036.66] Stressing
[1036.66 → 1038.00] That it is God
[1038.00 → 1038.88] Who keeps us
[1038.88 → 1039.70] From wandering
[1039.70 → 1041.08] From the blessings
[1041.08 → 1042.74] He lavishes upon us
[1042.74 → 1043.38] In Jesus
[1043.38 → 1045.32] It is God
[1045.32 → 1046.08] Who promises
[1046.08 → 1047.18] That nothing
[1047.18 → 1048.68] Can separate us
[1048.68 → 1049.66] From his love
[1049.66 → 1052.10] We cannot flourish
[1052.10 → 1053.38] By our own strength
[1053.38 → 1055.70] But through the transforming power
[1055.70 → 1056.84] Of the Holy Spirit
[1056.84 → 1058.68] We are invited
[1058.68 → 1060.00] To surrender
[1060.00 → 1061.36] Our wandering hearts
[1061.36 → 1063.00] Finding comfort
[1063.00 → 1064.14] And steadfast
[1064.14 → 1066.10] In his unfailing presence
[1066.10 → 1068.22] Would you stand
[1068.22 → 1068.76] And join us
[1068.76 → 1069.24] In this one
[1069.24 → 1078.74] Come the fount
[1078.74 → 1081.58] Of every blessing
[1081.58 → 1084.00] In my heart
[1084.00 → 1086.90] To sing thy praise
[1086.90 → 1089.38] Streams of mercy
[1089.38 → 1091.98] Never ceasing
[1091.98 → 1094.16] Call for songs
[1094.16 → 1097.08] Of loudest praise
[1097.08 → 1099.26] Teach me a song
[1099.26 → 1102.30] A melodious sonnet
[1102.30 → 1104.42] Sung by flaming
[1104.42 → 1106.32] Tongues above
[1106.32 → 1109.12] Praise the mountain
[1109.12 → 1111.94] Fixed upon it
[1111.94 → 1113.94] Mount of thy
[1113.94 → 1116.48] Redeeming love
[1116.48 → 1126.40] Here I raise
[1126.40 → 1128.00] My ebony
[1128.00 → 1129.32] Easier
[1129.32 → 1131.20] Hither by
[1131.20 → 1132.50] Thy help
[1132.50 → 1133.88] I've come
[1133.88 → 1136.20] And I hope
[1136.20 → 1138.94] Thy good pleasure
[1138.94 → 1142.12] Safely to arrive
[1142.12 → 1143.54] At home
[1143.54 → 1144.88] Jesus
[1144.88 → 1144.90] Jesus

[1685.24 → 1692.42] Today's special offering is for World Renew refugee sponsorship and resettlement.
[1693.00 → 1701.44] World Renew is one of a handful of Canadian agencies that have been granted a sponsorship agreement by Citizenship and Immigration Canada.
[1702.16 → 1707.28] This agreement enables Christian reform congregations to partner with other churches or groups
[1707.28 → 1717.62] to facilitate the process of refugee sponsorship to Canada in collaborative activities of love, mercy, justice, and compassion.
[1718.52 → 1726.02] In addition to refugee sponsorship, World Renew also speaks up about refugee issues
[1726.02 → 1733.22] and encourages Canadians to join in voicing concerns about immigration, reform, and refugee rights.
[1733.22 → 1737.28] This is a way of putting faith into action that can change lives.
[1737.52 → 1738.22] Thank you.

[1759.52 → 1769.16] Than here in your love

[1890.10 → 1904.10] good morning
[1907.22 → 1913.06] good morning if you are age three up to grade four I'd like to invite you to come join us up the front
[1913.06 → 1927.06] for kids corner and then children's worship time
[1930.58 → 1938.82] my question for you guys this morning is what are some different ways that we greet people so if you're
[1938.82 → 1942.02] seeing someone on the street or at school how would you greet them
[1945.78 → 1949.38] oh you're going to be kind to them when you greet them that's excellent ruby
[1951.22 → 1955.54] you could say hello that's a way that we greet people a lot of the time Gareth
[1956.98 → 1963.38] you could shake their hand you could welcome them you could do something like this
[1963.38 → 1969.14] you could wave at them right there are lots of different ways that we greet people now did you
[1969.14 → 1975.78] know that in different places around the world they have different ways of greeting people so we're
[1975.78 → 1980.18] going to practice a few of those to see what it's like to greet people in different way so I'm going
[1980.18 → 1984.82] to get you guys to stand up actually I'm going to get everyone to stand up this is a full church
[1984.82 → 1992.82] participation part of kids corner if there's a greeting that you don't feel comfortable doing
[1992.82 → 1997.94] you can just skip that one that's fine but i won't make them too difficult so the first one i want you
[1997.94 → 2003.30] to try is one that one of our kids mentioned, and it's a way that we often greet people in Canada and
[2003.30 → 2007.62] that's by shaking someone's hand so find someone around you and shake their hand
[2007.62 → 2021.78] all right we started off pretty easy now sometimes in Canada if you know somebody well if maybe
[2021.78 → 2026.58] you're greeting like your aunt came to visit, or you've seen your grandma for the first time in a
[2026.58 → 2031.62] while you might give them a hug so you can try if there's someone around you, you feel comfortable
[2031.62 → 2047.46] giving a hug to you can give someone a hug great job now there are some places in the world
[2047.46 → 2053.14] where greeting someone with a hug is not so you don't do that you don't greet someone with a hug
[2053.14 → 2059.54] and one of those places is in Japan so in Japan from what i understand that is not a common practice
[2059.54 → 2065.54] but instead you would greet somebody by bowing toward them and if it was someone older than you
[2065.54 → 2071.54] like your grandparent or an elder you would bow lower to them to show more respect so you're going
[2071.54 → 2087.54] to try doing a bow greeting now to someone around you bow your whole body from your hips down
[2089.54 → 2099.46] so if you were living in um somewhere like India or Thailand they also do a bow sort of greeting but
[2099.46 → 2104.10] it's a little bit different because they don't bow in Japan it's more about your body like hinging from
[2104.10 → 2110.90] your hips in Thailand or India or some other places I'm sure they put their hands together kind of
[2110.90 → 2117.30] like like like that like we say praying and then they do just a kind of small bow like that
[2117.30 → 2126.82] with they're the top so you can try that one
[2129.94 → 2135.14] now this one is a little bit interesting and this is a greeting in a place called Tibet which is a part
[2135.14 → 2141.22] of china and in Tibet a traditional way to greet someone is by sticking out your tongue at them
[2141.22 → 2145.06] kind of like this try it out
[2145.06 → 2164.82] if you were to live in Argentina or Peru or some Latin American countries in South America their way
[2164.82 → 2171.22] of greeting someone is to give somebody an air kiss on one cheek so only one cheek, and you don't
[2171.22 → 2177.54] actually touch them, but you would just do like an air kiss if you feel comfortable with that one your
[2177.54 → 2185.22] choice
[2189.14 → 2194.66] a lot of places in Europe i think maybe some of us are more familiar they do they kiss on the cheek as
[2194.66 → 2200.82] well, but we're gonna we're going to skip those I'm going to do one more this is a greeting in Zimbabwe
[2201.22 → 2207.70] which is in Africa and there is a traditional greeting where the first person so if i was going
[2207.70 → 2213.54] to greet then i would do one clap and then the person i was greeting would respond by doing two
[2213.54 → 2219.22] claps so you can try that out
[2219.22 → 2233.86] all right thank you for playing along you can have a seat so the reason we're talking about this is
[2233.86 → 2238.50] because for us in children's worship time today we are going to be talking about how the different
[2238.50 → 2245.46] ways that god talks to us and some of them are a little bit interesting and maybe unexpected and today
[2245.46 → 2252.42] we're going to be learning about a way that god talked to Moses in an unusual way so actually now
[2252.42 → 2257.14] that we sat down I'm just thinking we all have to stand up so back up it's exercise and church
[2257.14 → 2271.14] all right let's do the blessing
[2277.14 → 2278.10] you're not cool
[2278.10 → 2285.14] where are you
[2287.22 → 2290.26] good morning everyone my name is Eric I'm an elder here at Emmanuel
[2292.42 → 2296.98] got two items on my list here to go over first we had a council meeting this past week so i
[2296.98 → 2303.06] got a little bit of a summary of our meeting for you all we had a great meeting we had an opportunity
[2303.06 → 2308.02] to review all the volunteers that are helping out with all the programs and ministries at Emmanuel here
[2308.02 → 2312.82] so it's great to see all the people in our community here stepping up to make those things happen
[2312.82 → 2319.06] uh we had an opportunity to review the budget that was submitted by finance and uh those
[2319.86 → 2324.34] the budget has been sent to you in your midweek memo or by email so you can review that
[2324.34 → 2330.02] uh which will follow up to be an AGM meeting happening on November 29th which is a Wednesday
[2330.02 → 2336.50] uh we got a kind of fun idea happening on that meeting we're going to do a TRI soup competition
[2337.14 → 2342.18] so i think uh we're going to hopefully get a number of you to make some soup so we're going
[2342.18 → 2346.10] to have a little competition here to see who makes the best soup so we're going to have a little bit of
[2346.10 → 2352.18] a time of social and having a meal before the meeting so more details about that in your package
[2352.18 → 2359.62] for the AGM that's on November 29th uh the last thing that i want to talk about is uh as always
[2359.62 → 2365.06] at this time of the year we always have a conversation about uh the budget and the giving so we are a
[2365.06 → 2370.10] little bit behind which is usually typical at this time of the year most uh the time at Emmanuel a lot
[2370.10 → 2374.74] of the givings happen in December so i want to make sure that you have time with your family to
[2374.74 → 2382.74] prayerfully consider how you can support the needs of Emmanuel here as well I'm doing the family prayer
[2382.74 → 2391.14] this morning a few things that were in the midweek memo that i would like to review uh one that isn't
[2391.14 → 2397.22] in there uh this week tall jail one of the first uh families that Emmanuel has sponsored here
[2398.10 → 2401.54] he became a Canadian citizen this week so we're here to celebrate that
[2405.54 → 2410.58] it was a little bit of a long road for him because of his disabilities but it uh it happened this week
[2410.58 → 2416.98] so we're grateful for that uh if you haven't had a chance to read in the in your in the bulletin Joanne
[2416.98 → 2422.42] miles has been diagnosed with Parkinson's so our prayers go out to her as she makes her way through
[2422.42 → 2431.62] that diagnosis uh Jareena Jansen's granddaughter was diagnosed with lupus Diana trend cancer has come back so
[2431.62 → 2439.62] that's uh, uh Brenda and Linda's mom and uh she's not doing well so she's in going to be moving to
[2439.62 → 2446.10] palliative care in Langley here shortly uh frank and Sylvia helping's grandson Grayson we're praying that
[2446.10 → 2452.10] he can continue to grow strong and healthy and of course in the last few weeks we've had a number of
[2452.58 → 2458.18] people in our church who've experienced those loved ones who have passed away remember the must family
[2458.18 → 2460.74] the Benito family and the hogawonings
[2463.78 → 2467.94] as i was preparing for this family pair i spent some time reflecting on what is happening around
[2467.94 → 2473.86] me in my life and in our church community i went to the midweek memo to see what the prayer requests
[2473.86 → 2479.38] had been for the week in my reflection i realized there's so much going on in people's lives that does
[2479.38 → 2485.70] not make the prayer request column of our church i know that in my own life there are so many things
[2485.70 → 2491.22] that are going on that need prayer and these things take up a lot of time in my head and float around in
[2491.22 → 2497.54] my daily thinking those who I'm close to in my life have similar struggles going on as well so I'm
[2497.54 → 2504.50] confident that you all have things that you want to pray for as well the thing that i struggle with and
[2504.50 → 2510.26] am thankful for is that i can also reflect on the many blessings god has given me and to those around me
[2510.26 → 2518.90] those things that make you smile or warm your heart or make you so thankful i ask myself i don't
[2518.90 → 2524.10] understand why is that there are so many things that don't seem to be going right but there are so many
[2524.10 → 2531.22] things that are going right so since we are here this morning and there is nowhere to go no one asking
[2531.22 → 2537.22] or demanding your attention and few distractions I'm going to have some time of silence in my prayer where
[2537.22 → 2543.62] you can lay those prayer requests and questions that you have at the feet of Jesus and also those
[2543.62 → 2550.50] prayers of thanksgiving for the blessings you have received as well last week we sang a song called how

[2601.70 → 2608.82] have like gems cadets and the senior groups and many others lord along with these blessings come the
[2608.82 → 2615.14] trials and struggles of life we are aware of those in our lives that are struggling with disease sickness or
[2615.14 → 2621.38] chronic pain we have those in our lives that have to deal with difficult relationships maybe in our
[2621.38 → 2628.02] own home or extended family or at work we have children that make decisions or are living lives that
[2628.02 → 2634.58] keep us up late at night or cause stress in our lives lord we have people in our lives that struggle with
[2634.58 → 2639.06] mental health and loneliness and walking that road can be very difficult and challenging
[2639.06 → 2646.66] and lord many of us struggle with the pressures of life making enough money to provide worrying about
[2646.66 → 2652.82] the stability of jobs or simply not enjoying their work and wondering what god's plan is for their lives
[2654.10 → 2667.06] lord we want to take a few moments of silence to bring these struggles and strife to you so we can feel your presence in peace

[2718.98 → 2729.46] than sings my soul my saviour god to thee how great thou art how great thou art then sings my soul my saviour god to thee
[2730.34 → 2734.02] how great thou art how great thou art amen
[2741.14 → 2741.70] thanks sir
[2748.98 → 2763.70] if you have one uh with you or on your phone I'm going to invite you to open your bibles to Romans 10
[2764.82 → 2770.58] we're going to continue in our series on Romans beginning at verse 14 in chapter 10, and then we'll read
[2770.58 → 2778.74] through the end of the chapter um before we begin um excuse me I'm particularly mindful of the fact that
[2779.94 → 2789.62] you are about to participate in a text and a message that highlights the absolute utter necessity
[2790.50 → 2796.98] for preaching the word in the life of believers and i am losing my voice
[2800.02 → 2804.50] Malachi had a soccer game yesterday that was particularly close and i am one of the assistant
[2804.50 → 2811.14] coaches, and so i got loud and i think that may have affected uh my ability to speak this morning
[2811.14 → 2818.34] and so either that or uh the devil is at work, and he doesn't want this message heard
[2819.22 → 2824.58] um hoping it's the former but even if it's the latter you're going to get the same message i might just
[2824.58 → 2826.34] have to take a break for water every moment
[2826.34 → 2831.14] we are going to come into this text um
[2832.74 → 2838.74] based on where we have been and the journey that Paul has taken us on
[2839.30 → 2847.70] particularly in Romans 9 through to where we are now as we've dug deep and focused on that, and we've
[2847.70 → 2851.30] looked at god's sovereignty, and we've asked
[2851.30 → 2858.26] how does god work in the world to bring salvation what does he do and what's our part in that
[2860.74 → 2868.66] today we come to another step in that journey looking at god's sovereignty and asking what's our part
[2869.62 → 2874.26] in that and so with that let's read together
[2874.26 → 2880.10] Romans 10 beginning at verse 14
[2882.18 → 2888.66] how then can they call on the one they have not believed in how can they believe in the one of
[2888.66 → 2895.86] whom they have not heard and how can they hear without someone preaching to them and how can anyone
[2895.86 → 2903.62] preach unless they are sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news
[2904.26 → 2911.86] but not all the Israelites accepted the good news for Isaiah says lord who has believed our message
[2913.06 → 2919.86] consequently faith comes from hearing the message and the message are heard through the word about Christ
[2921.14 → 2930.02] but i ask did they not hear of course they did their voice has gone out into all the earth
[2930.02 → 2940.18] their words to the ends of the world again i ask did Israel not understand first Moses says i will make you
[2940.18 → 2946.34] envious by those who are not a nation and i will make you angry by a nation that has no understanding
[2947.38 → 2952.18] and Isaiah boldly says i was bound by those who did not seek me
[2952.18 → 2962.74] i revealed myself to those who did not ask for me but concerning Israel he says all day long i have
[2962.74 → 2969.22] held out my hands to a disobedient and obstinate people this is the word of the lord
[2973.06 → 2980.42] now i began just a moment ago by saying that this is a text about the absolute and utter necessity
[2980.42 → 2988.02] of the preached word and to be clear this is one of those places and times when i could stand here and be like
[2988.02 → 2989.78] this is my job security
[2991.78 → 3000.02] but what i hope you will see is that this text isn't just about me as a pastor preacher in a church
[3000.02 → 3005.30] but this text is about all of us who profess to believe
[3005.30 → 3017.70] and the big idea here is that not everyone who hears will believe but everyone who believes
[3017.70 → 3022.82] must declare i think that's an old big idea from last time let's not put that one up there
[3023.46 → 3029.70] not everyone who hears will believe but everyone who believes must declare because everyone who believes
[3029.70 → 3036.02] will have heard now i know that's a jumble and a journey, but we're going to get through there not
[3036.02 → 3042.90] everyone who hears will believe but everyone who does believe must declare because everyone who believes will have
[3043.62 → 3050.42] heard and so let's dig in i hope your bibles are open we're going to refer back for a moment to
[3050.42 → 3058.34] what has come before in order to make sense of what comes next, so the last section ended the last section
[3058.34 → 3064.98] that we looked at ends with verse 13 saying everyone who calls on the name of the lord
[3064.98 → 3072.50] will be saved and the reality for us there right is that that all anyone needs to do is all that anyone can
[3072.50 → 3078.42] do all anyone needs to do is all anyone can do and that's calling the name of the lord
[3079.14 → 3086.66] right the whole point of Romans up to this point in our journey together is having been for us to see that we
[3086.66 → 3098.18] that what we need to do in order to be saved we can't do, but god did right that the justice
[3098.82 → 3105.22] the judgment of sin and in the perfect standard of obedience required for righteousness that both of
[3105.22 → 3113.30] those are just too much for us to bear and so what we couldn't do or what Romans 8 verse 3 says what the
[3113.30 → 3121.14] law was powerless to do god did by sending his son in the likeness of sinful flesh to be a sin offering
[3122.66 → 3128.26] so I'll say it again all anyone needs to do is call on the one who has done it
[3130.26 → 3138.90] now what Paul does then is he clarifies for us what the content of calling on the name of the lord
[3138.90 → 3146.50] looks like or sounds like and so let's look back on this section to call on the name of the lord is
[3146.50 → 3154.66] to as we read in verse 9 declare with your mouth Jesus is lord and believe in your heart god raised him
[3154.66 → 3162.18] from the dead so i want to dig into that quickly with you for just a moment right to be saved that is
[3162.18 → 3172.26] to be a Christian you have to be able to say Jesus is lord right doing good isn't enough loving your
[3172.26 → 3178.90] neighbour isn't enough affirming and appreciating the tenants of a j Judeo-Christian culture or society
[3178.90 → 3187.70] isn't enough you have to say to believe in your heart that Jesus is lord now to be clear right that
[3187.70 → 3195.86] doing good will proceed from a profession of Jesus is lord appreciating and celebrating the tenants of
[3195.86 → 3202.02] a society or a culture that's structured around Christian principles might proceed from a profession
[3202.02 → 3210.90] that Jesus is lord, but any one of those things cannot replace the profession that Jesus is lord
[3210.90 → 3219.38] now the word lord that's used here in Greek these letters are written originally in Greek is curios
[3220.50 → 3226.42] it's the same word that the Septuagint which is the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible
[3227.46 → 3233.14] what we call the Old Testament it's the same word that the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible uses to
[3233.14 → 3240.10] translate the word Yahweh if you have a bible in front of you when you read the Old Testament, and it says
[3240.10 → 3248.82] lord in all caps that's Yahweh right the Hebrew personal name for god and into Greek that's
[3248.82 → 3256.66] translated lord now the title lord is being applied to Jesus and so what Paul is saying is to profess Jesus
[3256.66 → 3266.02] is lord is to say that Jesus is god to say Jesus is god is to say that he is king what's another word for
[3266.02 → 3277.22] king lord over our life right to be a Christian is to profess Jesus is lord and then the second point
[3277.22 → 3284.10] that Paul makes right to be a Christian to genuinely be converted in your hearts you must believe that god
[3284.10 → 3292.90] raised Jesus from the dead believing in a real literal resurrection is necessary to be Christian and
[3292.90 → 3299.78] Paul says this elsewhere he says in first Corinthians 15 I'll paraphrase it, but you will see the big text
[3299.78 → 3307.70] over behind me Paul says effectively if Christ has not been raised our faith is useless our preaching is
[3307.70 → 3317.94] pointless and our faith is futile we are still in our sin now these two things together professing Jesus
[3317.94 → 3322.74] lord right and believing that god raised him from the dead these two things together
[3324.50 → 3332.90] are what it means to call on the name of the lord right in the simplest of terms a Christian is someone
[3332.90 → 3341.30] who trusts god more than you trust yourself and so that means you can say god is god Jesus is god and i am
[3341.30 → 3350.02] not that means you can say Jesus did everything he paid it all and i trust in him because i can't do it
[3352.26 → 3358.90] now remember that right, right hold on to that those three things there right the content of the
[3358.90 → 3366.02] gospel or of the good news of the message that we proclaim is Jesus is lord and god raised him from the dead
[3366.02 → 3372.66] that a Christian is someone who trusts god more than they trust themselves and three that god is god
[3372.66 → 3380.50] Jesus is god and i am not Jesus did it all because i can't right hold on to those three I'll repeat them
[3380.50 → 3385.62] one more time Jesus is lord god raised him from the dead a Christian is someone who trusts god more than
[3385.62 → 3394.66] they trust themselves god is god Jesus is god and i am not because he did it all park that in your brain
[3394.66 → 3405.14] space because we're going to pick that up near the end so believing this truth this those three things
[3405.14 → 3414.50] believing that in your heart is what makes us Christian now I'm anticipating your questions
[3415.46 → 3423.86] because of course there's going to be doubts right there's going to be seasons of unbelief or skepticism
[3423.86 → 3428.26] there's going to be times of questioning and of wondering right there's going to be times when
[3428.26 → 3434.66] it feels impossible to believe that that is true there's going to be times in your life where we
[3434.66 → 3444.02] struggle to connect that belief or that profession with how we live in our lives now all of that remains
[3444.02 → 3450.50] true right even as all of that remains true in our hearts in our minds and in our struggles right we
[3450.50 → 3458.02] still believe are called to believe right when we talk about this as one of the works of the holy
[3458.02 → 3465.22] spirit in our lives right to provide this assurance a deep-rooted assurance in our hearts even in the
[3465.22 → 3473.70] face of doubt and yes i know this is true not only because i live it but because i have the privilege of
[3473.70 → 3479.22] walking with so many of you in the midst of it sometimes doubt is stronger than faith
[3482.42 → 3487.54] but can I say that doubt is never stronger than grace
[3490.26 → 3497.22] right that's why we cling to the truth that he will hold me fast that's why we cling to the truth
[3497.22 → 3503.22] that like when Paul says to timothy that when we are faithless he remains faithful for he cannot
[3503.22 → 3510.98] disown himself doubt may be stronger than faith, but it's never stronger than grace
[3512.74 → 3520.82] and for most of us faith without doubts right faith that doesn't experience these kinds of questions
[3520.82 → 3523.54] is actually a faith that has grown stagnant
[3525.62 → 3531.94] now for some of us that's not true that we have become such in the lord that we are so confident that
[3531.94 → 3538.66] we never experienced those doubts and i praise god if that is your testimony in my experience it is only
[3538.66 → 3543.46] the most saintly senior women who get to that point in their lives of faith
[3545.38 → 3549.30] for almost everyone else we struggle we have doubts
[3551.78 → 3552.26] and so
[3552.26 → 3559.70] don't fear doubts in your life of faith instead worship through them
[3561.14 → 3569.06] and even with our doubts a Christian professes the truth that Jesus is lord and that god raised him from
[3569.06 → 3576.90] the dead i believe help my unbelief right believing this truth about Jesus is what in our hearts is what makes
[3576.90 → 3584.42] us Christian now this is connected to the idea that we looked at last week and that's online if you want to
[3584.42 → 3592.74] find it that regeneration precedes faith I'm not going to get back into all of that but what Paul then based on that
[3592.74 → 3601.38] shifts to with a nice bit of rhetorical flourish both in his anticipation of a question but also in
[3601.38 → 3608.82] identifying how this sovereign decree of god works itself out functionally or practically in history
[3608.82 → 3613.78] in the lives of the individual believers and communities to whom he speaks Paul then says
[3615.06 → 3625.14] how then can they call on one they have not believed in that is to say in space time in front of us here and now
[3625.14 → 3630.50] where does this believing come from how does this belief come about
[3631.86 → 3639.54] and so the next question pushing right through he says how can they believe in one of whom they have not heard
[3642.50 → 3649.78] to believe to profess to be a Christian you must hear
[3649.78 → 3657.54] right the way that god has set up his order of salvation requires that we hear, and it's not just
[3657.54 → 3663.46] any type of hearing right it's its not like you can just stand outside on the street corner and read
[3663.46 → 3669.86] the bible and whoever happens to hear it will all of a sudden come to this kind of believing
[3670.50 → 3676.42] right the bible is not a book of magic or of spells in that regard the kind of believing and hearing that
[3676.42 → 3682.42] that we're talking about is penetrating to understanding it needs to really be heard it
[3682.42 → 3687.62] needs to really be understood or let me rephrase that it needs to be understood as real
[3690.02 → 3697.70] right Jesus really did rise from the dead Jesus really is lord god really is more trustworthy than anything
[3697.70 → 3705.38] or anyone else Jesus really is god and i am not he really did it all because i can't
[3706.42 → 3716.50] understand now again you might hear that, and you might think okay well like what's the threshold
[3717.46 → 3722.50] what's the what's the set point limit right what's the bar that i need to hit for this
[3722.90 → 3730.34] understanding before that i can really say that I'm a Christian now the simple answer to that is
[3730.34 → 3735.38] can you say Jesus is lord and do you believe that god raised him from the dead right if you can say yes to
[3735.38 → 3741.86] that then that that's the set point limit that's the threshold you are a Christian but i also want to
[3741.86 → 3749.62] say, and we also need to hear that with your age or your ability whatever that may be and whatever that is
[3749.62 → 3758.98] otherwise impacted by right your maturity your ability to make this profession needs to grow
[3758.98 → 3774.98] in the bible faith is often talked about like a seed right and seeds are planted and watered and cultivated
[3774.98 → 3779.86] and they grow right in order for seeds to fulfill their purpose they must grow
[3779.86 → 3794.18] and one of the ways that you can tell that your faith is real is by how you can see it growing
[3795.46 → 3801.38] right are you producing the fruit of the spirit in your life are you experiencing more and more comfort in
[3801.38 → 3815.06] the grace of god's goodness are you digging into who god is the Christian tradition for thousands of
[3815.06 → 3824.42] years has been marked by the idea of faith seeking understanding this is actually the title of a work by an
[3824.42 → 3832.90] 11th century Christian named Anselm which is about exploring the deep things of god and the world through
[3832.90 → 3844.42] the exercise of the mind through faith right faith wrestles for understanding there's nothing blind about Christian faith
[3844.42 → 3856.10] how can they hear Paul says without someone preaching to them and so this is what we see right the message must be heard and the
[3856.10 → 3866.18] message must be communicated it must be preached now the word that's used for preaching here and without someone preaching to
[3866.18 → 3874.18] them literally means to be a herald and a herald is a person who makes an announcement
[3874.42 → 3880.18] in the ancient world a herald would stand on the street corners or in the marketplace, and they would
[3880.18 → 3886.82] share the news that they've heard now don't hear what I'm not saying I'm not saying you all need to become
[3886.82 → 3894.26] street preachers but whatever street you're on it's your responsibility to herald hear what i mean
[3894.26 → 3902.18] right preaching doesn't only mean sermons like this or in this context right you herald in the marketplace
[3902.18 → 3908.34] whatever that is for you, you herald at work you herald in your neighbourhood you herald on campus you
[3908.34 → 3920.10] herald at school that your whole life heralds the person and work of Jesus announces holds out for all to see
[3921.54 → 3929.30] and like we said right i said at the beginning this text may indicate some of my job security but this also
[3929.30 → 3936.10] just isn't my job right this isn't also just the job of missionaries whether we send them locally
[3936.10 → 3941.70] or globally this isn't just the job of chaplains in universities or in the military this isn't just
[3941.70 → 3948.90] the responsibility of Tim and charity in shoe swap or of Jody and Uriel in Rosarito right everyone here
[3949.78 → 3957.38] who believes is a herald now of course it's true that the way we do that and the context where we do that
[3957.38 → 3964.26] even how perhaps of doing that looks different right and of course the reality is that our
[3964.26 → 3972.50] gathering here on Sundays is critical for your heralding out there right precisely because we
[3972.50 → 3979.78] believe that this message is eternal life or eternal death precisely because we believe that this word
[3979.78 → 3987.78] opens and closes the kingdom of heaven we believe it is important to tell people everywhere to hear
[3988.74 → 3998.02] and so we support global missions, and so we support local missions and hearing stories of god at work in
[3998.02 → 4007.78] those places and through those people is profound, and it fuels our faith and our relationship to god right
[4007.78 → 4011.30] right we want to see god at work in the community and in the world
[4013.38 → 4014.02] but also
[4016.66 → 4028.98] hearing that here encourages us out there the truth is that wherever you go you are sent as a herald by god
[4030.26 → 4035.78] it doesn't matter if it's the soccer pitch on Saturday or if it's Starbucks for a shift on Tuesday
[4035.78 → 4041.62] if it's the office for the week or even on zoom or teams or google meet you are a herald
[4044.26 → 4047.30] how can they preach unless they are sent
[4048.82 → 4056.50] you are sent wherever you go you are sent that's why if you've been around for a couple of weeks here
[4056.50 → 4061.62] where we're working on this community art project which will hopefully take shape on the back wall over there
[4061.62 → 4068.18] where we gather grow and go here, and we're asking for images of the spaces and the workplaces
[4068.18 → 4075.30] in the third places of your life because that is where you are sent right this is where the mission of god is
[4075.30 → 4081.46] being fulfilled in our midst wherever you are as one person i read this week said
[4081.46 → 4090.02] god has sent us with the message of salvation he may send us overseas into the pulpit or across the street
[4090.02 → 4095.94] to our neighbour but ours are the beautiful feet bringing good news
[4095.94 → 4103.54] now you hear that
[4105.78 → 4107.62] some of you go i get it
[4113.06 → 4114.18] some of you are ready for that
[4116.90 → 4117.86] but this is going to get hard
[4117.86 → 4121.14] because the truth is
[4122.82 → 4123.30] some of us
[4125.46 → 4126.90] and i will include myself in this
[4129.62 → 4131.78] some of us have let our feet get pretty ugly
[4136.34 → 4138.82] beautiful feet are the ones that are bringing good news
[4140.58 → 4142.34] some of us have stopped bringing the good news
[4142.34 → 4149.38] some of us have never brought the good news some of us though sent have gotten stuck or stopped by fear
[4149.38 → 4156.58] or anxiety or worry about what other people might think and so the dust of our inactivity has settled
[4156.58 → 4162.98] onto our feet the dirt has collected around our toes and our feet aren't beautiful because we aren't
[4162.98 → 4164.74] bringing the good news
[4166.50 → 4167.78] and so hear this challenge
[4167.78 → 4171.70] it's time together
[4172.74 → 4173.86] to wash our feet
[4174.90 → 4177.38] to make our feet beautiful
[4178.02 → 4187.14] it's time to knock off the dust and the dirt and to be sent again right we will never reach people for Jesus if we are never reaching people
[4191.30 → 4191.46] now
[4192.58 → 4196.50] at this point and i get it i get it right this is where people usually say
[4196.50 → 4199.14] but i don't know what to say
[4200.26 → 4201.62] or what if i don't have an answer
[4202.34 → 4211.22] what if i get embarrassed or what if i misrepresent god what if i don't do a good enough job what if what i actually say ends up moving people further away from god
[4213.70 → 4214.26] first
[4216.58 → 4217.62] and i just
[4217.62 → 4221.94] encourage you and remind you that you do know what to say
[4221.94 → 4223.94] i
[4224.34 → 4225.62] remember let's unpack
[4226.34 → 4227.22] Jesus is lord
[4227.86 → 4229.06] god raised him from the dead
[4230.10 → 4233.14] a Christian is someone who trusts god more than they trust themselves
[4234.34 → 4239.78] and god is god Jesus is god and i am not Jesus did it
[4239.78 → 4240.90] all because i
[4241.46 → 4241.78] can't
[4242.74 → 4245.38] that's it that's the content of the message
[4245.38 → 4249.22] and then let me add to that right god didn't send you
[4249.94 → 4254.18] to wherever it is that he has sent you relying on your effectiveness
[4255.62 → 4257.70] right god sent you relying on his
[4259.70 → 4265.14] right you are sent with a message, and it's god's power that will make that message effective
[4265.14 → 4268.02] to salvation right it's his power not ours
[4268.02 → 4271.22] now to be sure we want to be winsome
[4272.74 → 4273.62] right to be sure
[4274.50 → 4280.10] we don't want to be jerks about it and I've seen too many people try to talk about faith that end up just
[4280.10 → 4281.06] sounding like a jerk
[4282.50 → 4285.54] but again it's not our words that bring
[4286.26 → 4286.90] salvation
[4287.62 → 4288.82] it's god's word
[4292.10 → 4292.82] i have seen
[4292.82 → 4297.38] my almost 11-year-old daughter
[4298.26 → 4304.10] ministered the gospel to a more than 70 year old woman in the hospital as she called her to trust in god
[4304.66 → 4306.82] and to name god as a god that we can trust
[4308.66 → 4310.18] and i saw it through my own tears
[4312.10 → 4313.06] and i have seen
[4313.78 → 4320.34] pre-teen girls encourage each other with words of faith from Jesus and the bible and challenging each other to rely on him
[4320.34 → 4323.38] and if they can do it
[4324.90 → 4325.54] so can we
[4326.74 → 4327.78] we can all do this
[4329.78 → 4336.74] the the most committed missionary for the gospel that i have ever met
[4339.78 → 4346.66] was an 88-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis who hadn't been able to move her hands for 30 years
[4346.66 → 4350.82] but whose heart sang the glories of Jesus every time you talked to her
[4353.78 → 4354.58] we can do this
[4355.70 → 4356.74] in fact we must
[4358.10 → 4361.46] right we've we've seen throughout all of Romans
[4362.02 → 4366.66] that you don't contribute anything to your salvation except for the need
[4369.46 → 4371.38] what we're beginning to see i hope
[4371.38 → 4372.58] hope
[4372.58 → 4376.34] is that you might contribute something to the salvation of another
[4376.34 → 4384.34] your responsibility in the sovereign plan of god might be to be the one who preaches
[4384.98 → 4390.90] the gospel who heralds the king Jesus to them
[4390.90 → 4397.78] god has made preaching the gospel necessary for salvation, and so we preach that gospel as near
[4397.78 → 4404.82] and as far and as wide as we possibly can hope and trusting that god is faithful to his promise
[4404.82 → 4411.94] that god's word is effective and true, and it will accomplish the purpose for which he has sent it out
[4413.38 → 4416.74] that's why we proclaim we need no other reason
[4416.74 → 4421.06] now of course
[4422.74 → 4426.42] the hard reality here is that
[4427.14 → 4436.34] this message isn't always accepted the beauty of this gospel isn't always seen as such
[4437.86 → 4444.58] and Paul knows this too right that's part of this entire lament that has pervaded through these three chapters
[4444.58 → 4451.94] right Paul recognizes that in verse 16 when he says that not all Israel accepted the good news
[4452.58 → 4457.38] and he also makes the point that it's not because they didn't hear it's not because they didn't
[4457.38 → 4463.70] understand right for them Paul leaves those excuses away he says it's not because of that verse 18 notice
[4464.26 → 4465.30] we'll go through here quickly
[4465.30 → 4471.86] uh their voice has gone out into all the earth their words to the end of the world this is a quote
[4471.86 → 4479.70] from psalm 19 and i think what Paul is doing here is applying it uh psalm 19 to the historical reality
[4479.70 → 4487.30] that wherever there was a Jewish diaspora community in the Roman Empire the gospel had been preached to
[4487.30 → 4492.50] them because the missionaries who came their first stop almost always was in the synagogues
[4493.22 → 4499.54] teaching the Jews they had heard the good news they don't have that excuse, and then he goes on quoting from
[4500.18 → 4504.34] Deuteronomy and Isaiah Paul makes the case that Israel can't say
[4504.98 → 4508.58] we didn't understand Paul says they did notice the contrast he says
[4508.58 → 4518.02] i will make you angry by a nation that has no understanding so if the gentiles have no understanding
[4518.74 → 4525.70] the inference of the parallel is that the Israelites have understanding, or they should have had
[4525.70 → 4533.62] understanding god revealed himself to those who did not ask the Israelites knew to ask, and then you get
[4533.62 → 4542.66] this picture of god which is simultaneously terrifying and beautiful in its patience you have a picture
[4542.66 → 4552.18] of god who stood before his people holding out his hands, and they remained disobedient and obstinate Paul's words
[4554.26 → 4560.10] Israel didn't respond to the word that was preached to them because they were disobedient and obstinate
[4560.10 → 4562.98] that's a hard word
[4565.78 → 4571.62] and the point here is to highlight that their rejection of the gospel is not because they didn't hear or
[4571.62 → 4578.34] because they didn't understand it's because they remained disobedient and obstinate and so maybe we take
[4578.34 → 4584.34] that hard word for us, and we turn it into a challenge right because my prayer is that everybody who comes through
[4584.34 → 4591.62] these doors that everybody who is in or adjacent to this community and so that is people who are in your
[4591.62 → 4599.54] spheres of connection and influence that everybody in your life whoever you meet will not reject the gospel
[4599.54 → 4606.74] because they didn't hear or understand because you have told them, and you have helped them to see
[4606.74 → 4618.02] right that's our job it's our job to help them understand and so let's let's land this plane together and so
[4619.70 → 4628.58] the next time someone asks you what does it mean to be a Christian you can say a Christian is someone who
[4628.58 → 4635.06] trusts god more than they trust themselves and then tell them a story of what that looks like in your life
[4635.06 → 4638.42] about how you've lived that or seen that or how that's shown up
[4639.86 → 4645.70] the next time you have a co-worker or someone in your life who is talking about a loved one who is
[4645.70 → 4652.42] dying or on their deathbed or who has suddenly died say to them, i believe that Jesus is lord and
[4652.42 → 4659.14] that god raised him from the dead and then tell them a story about how the hope of that moment changes your
[4659.14 → 4667.86] experience of death and dying and offer that out to them the next time your friends say to you
[4669.46 → 4679.06] I'm not worth it or nobody loves me I'm not good enough you can tell them that they are so loved by
[4679.06 → 4689.14] god that he sent his one and only son to live and die for them that god himself thinks you are so worth it
[4689.14 → 4698.10] that he gave himself up for you, and then you can tell them a story of how that has changed your life
[4698.10 → 4705.38] and about how you through doubt and struggle are trying to live in that reality
[4709.70 → 4715.54] here it is one more time at the end not everyone who hears will believe
[4716.82 → 4723.70] but everyone who believes must herald because everyone who believes will have heard
[4723.70 → 4738.34] it breaks my heart when i talk to people who growing up in a Christian church growing up in a Christian
[4738.34 → 4747.62] community at the age of 50 or 60 have said to me, i don't think i ever heard the gospel
[4747.62 → 4755.38] at the age of 40 who can say i think this is the first time my heart might actually have been
[4755.38 → 4765.54] converted to Jesus Christ now i am abundantly clear that's not because the gospel or that's not
[4765.54 → 4771.06] necessarily because the gospel wasn't proclaimed in their lives or in their spaces it's just that they
[4771.06 → 4774.58] didn't hear it, or they didn't have the ears to hear at that point but
[4774.58 → 4782.34] i also know that there are times and places where the gospel isn't being proclaimed by people who
[4782.34 → 4792.98] profess to be saved by the gospel and please lord may that never be us may that never be here may that
[4792.98 → 4797.38] never be in your homes or workplaces or third places
[4797.38 → 4804.58] never be in your homes or third places everyone who believes will have heard my prayer is that you
[4804.58 → 4808.34] will be the one to tell them let's pray together
[4817.46 → 4820.10] holy god use us we pray
[4820.10 → 4832.90] use us to proclaim the message of your salvation use us to boldly proclaim that you lord Jesus
[4833.70 → 4839.54] are king that you are god and that you have been raised from the dead
[4842.74 → 4849.30] may we boldly proclaim this truth to a world and to a people that so desperately need to hear it
[4850.10 → 4859.62] and then lord god use our proclaiming to grow your church use our proclaiming to reveal your kingdom
[4859.62 → 4869.86] come and your kingdom coming wherever we go may we go as those with a message may we go as those with a
[4869.86 → 4877.78] purpose in being sent may we go as those who are confident in you and you alone
[4877.78 → 4885.54] we go because you have sent us, and so we go in the power of your name
[4886.58 → 4898.58] it's in your name lord Jesus Christ that we pray amen
[4898.58 → 4912.66] now we know that sometimes words are hard to understand
[4914.34 → 4924.50] and so god knowing that has given us a meal he has given us a picture to confirm for us the words
[4924.50 → 4929.30] that Jesus is
[4929.30 → 4932.18] is lord and to show us
[4932.18 → 4941.14] right in the breaking of the bread and in the drinking of the cup that Jesus Christ has been raised
[4941.14 → 4949.54] from the dead we come to this table as confirmation of this truth of the gospel we come to this table
[4949.54 → 4957.38] because the word of god is alive and active among us, we come to this table because god invites us to receive
[4957.86 → 4958.82] him here
[4960.98 → 4962.42] and so when words are hard
[4963.46 → 4964.50] god gives you a meal
[4966.18 → 4968.58] and this meal is eaten in community
[4968.58 → 4976.34] together as we come to this table we will do so with a bit of a liturgy that is going to appear on the screen behind me
[4976.34 → 4980.66] i invite you to speak the words that are indicated for you to speak
[4982.18 → 4984.98] at the table of the lord lift your hearts
[4984.98 → 4990.34] let us give thanks to the lord our god
[4994.26 → 4995.14] let's pray together
[4997.46 → 5004.42] with joy we praise you gracious god for you have created heaven and earth you have made us
[5004.42 → 5008.34] in your image you have kept covenant with us even when we fell into sin
[5008.34 → 5017.22] we give you thanks for Jesus Christ who by his life death and resurrection open to us the way of life
[5017.78 → 5018.58] everlasting
[5019.38 → 5019.86] amen
[5022.34 → 5030.34] our lord Jesus before he suffered gave us this memorial of his sacrifice until he comes again
[5030.82 → 5037.78] the lord Jesus on the night that he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and
[5037.78 → 5044.42] said this is my body which is for you do this in remembrance of me
[5045.46 → 5048.42] in the same way after supper he took the cup
[5049.30 → 5053.06] he said this cup is the new covenant in my blood
[5054.58 → 5058.98] do this whenever you drink it in remembrance of me
[5060.50 → 5067.14] for whenever you eat this bread whenever you drink this cup you proclaim the lord's death until he
[5067.14 → 5073.62] comes again this is the mystery of our faith
[5073.62 → 5083.38] your death oh Christ we proclaim your resurrection we affirm with joy your coming we await with hope
[5084.10 → 5086.50] glory be to you lord Jesus
[5086.50 → 5092.98] Jesus is lord god has raised him from the dead
[5092.98 → 5093.62] from the dead
[5094.18 → 5101.30] church family the lord has prepared this table for all who can make that profession for all who love him and
[5101.30 → 5108.58] trust in him for their salvation and so come to this table you who have much faith, and you would like to have more
[5108.58 → 5115.06] come to this table you who have been to this sacrament often and you who have not been for a long time
[5115.06 → 5124.18] come to this table you who have tried to follow Jesus and you who have failed come to this table because Jesus is
[5124.18 → 5125.06] raised
[5125.06 → 5127.06] raised
[5127.06 → 5127.14] come
[5127.14 → 5131.70] if you are here in person or if you are joining online come
[5132.26 → 5136.02] because it is Christ who invites us to meet him here
[5136.74 → 5139.94] the gifts of god for the people of god
[5142.42 → 5144.34] as we come to this table
[5144.34 → 5151.06] we will do so in groups, and we will gather in a circle around, and we will pass the elements one to the next
[5151.46 → 5156.82] there will be some elders who will usher the rows and tell you when it's your turn to come up and then gather in a circle
[5157.22 → 5163.78] myself and the elders here will help serve as you pass the tray of bread to the person beside you
[5163.78 → 5171.14] we invite you to say the body of Christ given for you as you pass the tray of juice to the person beside you
[5171.14 → 5174.58] we invite you to say the blood of Christ shed for you
[5175.86 → 5181.30] we're going to begin the first table with the worship volunteers and the people who are going to be around
[5181.62 → 5186.42] helping us facilitate that, and then we will sing through the rest of the liturgy together
[5186.98 → 5193.22] if you would like prayer while we are meeting there are people available who have prayer tags on they would love to meet with you
[5193.22 → 5195.22] they'll be in the foyer in the back
[5195.22 → 5200.26] they can meet you for prayer before you come to the table or in lieu of coming to the table whatever the case may be
[5200.26 → 5206.42] we want to meet you there if you are unable to come up to the front please indicate that to the usher and
[5206.42 → 5213.78] they will serve you in your seat as well passing the body and blood to you, I'm going to invite those
[5213.78 → 5219.78] worship volunteers to come forward at this time

[5311.14 → 5312.56] The blood of Christ shed for you.
[5320.42 → 5324.84] The blood of Christ shed for you.
[5326.34 → 5327.72] The blood of Christ shed for you.
[5336.94 → 5337.76] Thanks to all of us.
[5350.42 → 5360.26] Drink and believe.
[5360.26 → 5360.38] Amen.
[5360.38 → 5361.38] Amen.
[5361.38 → 5362.38] Amen.
[5362.38 → 5363.38] Amen.
[5363.38 → 5367.38] Amen.
[5380.42 → 5381.42] Amen.
[5410.42 → 5411.56] Amen.
[5422.80 → 5423.38] Amen.
[5424.10 → 5434.48] I pass my line to Calvary,
[5434.48 → 5442.66] Where Jesus fled and died for me
[5442.66 → 5450.48] I see his wounds, his hands, his feet
[5451.12 → 5458.48] My Saviour on that cursed tree
[5458.48 → 5470.18] His body fell and drenched in tears
[5470.18 → 5477.78] They laid him down in Joseph's tomb
[5477.78 → 5485.38] The entrance sealed by heavy stone
[5485.38 → 5492.88] Messiah still and all alone
[5492.88 → 5505.52] O praise the name of the Lord our God
[5505.52 → 5512.38] O praise his name forevermore
[5512.38 → 5519.88] For endless days we will sing your praise
[5519.88 → 5525.88] O Lord, O Lord our God
[5525.88 → 5537.38] Then on the third and break of dawn
[5537.38 → 5545.38] The Son of Heaven rose again
[5545.38 → 5552.88] O trampled earth, where is your strength
[5552.88 → 5560.88] The angels roar for Christ the King
[5560.88 → 5572.38] O praise the name of the Lord our God
[5572.38 → 5580.38] O praise his name forevermore
[5580.38 → 5587.88] For endless days we will sing your praise
[5587.88 → 5593.88] O Lord, O Lord our God
[5593.88 → 5595.38] O Lord our God
[5595.38 → 5601.38] He shall return
[5601.38 → 5605.38] In robes of white
[5605.38 → 5608.38] The blazing sun
[5608.38 → 5613.38] Shall pierce the night
[5613.38 → 5616.88] And I will rise
[5616.88 → 5617.88] And I will rise
[5617.88 → 5620.88] Above the saints
[5620.88 → 5624.88] My gaze transpaced
[5624.88 → 5629.88] On Jesus' face
[5629.88 → 5631.38] On Jesus' face
[5631.38 → 5635.38] On Jesus' face
[5635.38 → 5637.38] On Jesus' face
[5637.38 → 5639.38] On Jesus' face
[5639.38 → 5648.88] On Jesus' face
[5648.88 → 5658.38] On Jesus' face
[5658.38 → 5663.38] On Jesus' face
[5663.38 → 5670.88] O praise the name of the Lord our God
[5670.88 → 5672.38] O praise his name
[5672.38 → 5676.38] O praise his name forevermore
[5676.38 → 5682.38] For endless days we will sing your praise
[5682.38 → 5684.88] O praise his name
[5684.88 → 5696.88] O praise his name
[5696.88 → 5701.38] O praise his name forevermore
[5701.38 → 5704.88] For endless days we will sing your praise
[5704.88 → 5708.88] O praise his name forevermore
[5708.88 → 5709.88] If commissions of the doubt
[5709.88 → 5710.88] Lord our God
[5710.88 → 5712.38] And of course our praise
[5712.38 → 5712.88] O praise his name forever
