[0.00 → 29.98] Thank you.
[30.00 → 59.98] Thank you.
[60.00 → 89.98] Thank you.
[90.00 → 119.98] Thank you.
[120.00 → 149.98] Thank you.
[150.00 → 152.00] Thank you.
[180.00 → 182.00] Thank you.
[210.00 → 212.00] Thank you.
[240.00 → 242.00] Thank you.
[270.00 → 272.00] Thank you.
[300.00 → 302.00] Thank you.
[330.00 → 332.00] Thank you.
[360.00 → 362.00] Thank you.
[362.00 → 364.00] Thank you.
[392.00 → 394.00] Thank you.
[394.00 → 398.00] Thank you.
[422.00 → 451.98] Thank you.
[452.00 → 481.98] Thank you.
[482.00 → 511.98] Thank you.
[512.00 → 541.98] Thank you.
[542.00 → 544.00] Thank you.
[572.00 → 574.00] Thank you.
[574.00 → 576.00] Thank you.
[576.00 → 578.00] Thank you.
[578.00 → 580.00] Thank you.
[580.00 → 580.50] Okay.
[581.00 → 583.00] So I have two announcements for the young adults.
[583.38 → 585.44] Well, one for the whole congregation and one for the young adults.
[585.86 → 589.86] The one for the young adults is the Bible studies today at 1 p.m. at my house.
[590.34 → 591.82] I'll get you the address if you don't know it.
[592.04 → 592.88] And it's out there.
[592.88 → 594.88] Come prepared.
[594.88 → 595.32] Come prepared.
[595.56 → 596.38] Lunch will be there.
[596.88 → 600.02] And we'll be resuming our first Corinthians Bible study at chapter 12.
[601.12 → 604.94] The announcement for the whole congregation is the it's about the time of the year when
[604.94 → 608.12] we do the care packages for the young adults that are away abroad at school.
[608.12 → 612.16] We have more students that are gone this year than previous years.
[612.16 → 614.12] We have about 13 gone this year.
[615.18 → 617.30] And I still need about eight more volunteers.
[617.80 → 621.56] And so what you need to know if you want to volunteer and help me with this, first, come
[621.56 → 624.30] and contact me after the service or email me or message me.
[624.30 → 626.78] And second, this is what I need.
[627.50 → 631.70] The care packages should be about the size of a shoebox because that's about the size
[631.70 → 633.80] of the package we send to the young adults.
[634.46 → 640.80] Don't buy a box from like shoppers or like Canada Post or pay for shipping because that's
[640.80 → 641.58] what I'll be doing.
[642.04 → 642.74] Saves you money.
[644.90 → 647.50] No more than $50 worth of stuff.
[647.64 → 649.60] You guys go over every year and that's great.
[649.86 → 653.62] But just try to, you know, limit it to $50 if we can.
[653.62 → 656.26] We don't, it's not, you know, it's not Christmas.
[657.04 → 669.62] So, and then aim to bring it by next Monday, January 20, October, October 29th.
[671.66 → 673.60] But if you can't make it, that's fine.
[673.64 → 675.16] I'm shipping them out the following Tuesday.
[675.48 → 676.90] So you have a little wiggle room.
[677.90 → 679.36] Yeah, that's all.
[679.68 → 680.28] Thank you very much.
[683.62 → 684.62] Thank you.
[684.62 → 685.62] Thank you.
[685.62 → 686.62] Thank you.
[686.62 → 687.62] Thank you.
[687.62 → 688.62] Thank you.
[688.62 → 689.62] Thank you.
[689.62 → 690.62] Thank you.
[690.62 → 691.62] Thank you.
[691.62 → 692.62] Thank you.
[692.62 → 693.62] Thank you.
[693.62 → 705.62] This happens during the break every year. It's often a group of youth and leaders, but it's not limited to youth and leaders.
[705.62 → 711.62] So if you are interested in participating in this year's Mexico mission trip, Brandon is here.
[711.62 → 717.62] There you go. That's the guy you want to talk to. He'll be in the foyer afterwards having coffee.
[717.62 → 728.62] Grab him, talk with him. You want to try to get early info and sign up so we can know how many people want to participate in that trip this year.
[728.62 → 732.62] I think that's it. Oh, no, one more.
[732.62 → 743.62] Next Wednesday, October 29th at 6pm, we are hosting Revival Hymns, a folk-style traditional hymn worship event.
[743.62 → 749.62] And so we invite you all to participate and to come 6pm next Sunday.
[749.62 → 757.62] It's also a good opportunity to invite friends, family, or neighbours that you've been talking to, maybe about faith or about church,
[757.62 → 766.62] and to bring them into this kind of event, a little bit more casual and a little bit more of an opportunity for us to gather and pray for God's gift.
[766.62 → 774.62] Believe that today. As you're able, I'm going to invite you to stand, and we can be welcomed into God's presence together.
[774.62 → 776.62] Amen.
[776.62 → 786.62] We're standing together with the body of Christ Jesus who welcomes us into this time of worship with His reason.
[786.62 → 798.62] grace, mercy, and peace to you, from God our Father, to the Lord, to the Christ, Son, and our Saviour, through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[798.62 → 799.62] Amen.
[799.62 → 809.62] We've been greeted by God and by the eternal of those around you and greet them in the name of Jesus Christ.
[809.62 → 811.62] Amen.
[811.62 → 812.62] Amen.

[841.62 → 846.10] Good morning.
[850.66 → 851.80] Good morning.
[852.14 → 859.62] Our call to worship this morning is taken from a vision of heavenly worship before the throne of God.
[860.36 → 866.74] A vision that John received while on the island of Patmos and is recorded for us in Revelation 4.
[866.74 → 871.72] Let's begin our worship with these words of praise from Revelation 4.
[872.78 → 879.54] Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come.
[880.40 → 885.40] You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honour and power.
[886.00 → 891.88] For you created all things, and by your will they were created and have their being.
[892.72 → 894.56] Let's worship our Lord and God together.
[896.74 → 898.74] Amen.

[1551.74 → 1553.74] Let's pray together.
[1553.74 → 1559.32] Merciful God, we love you and we exalt your name.
[1560.06 → 1563.20] When we read the record of John's vision before the throne in heaven,
[1563.30 → 1566.18] we can't help but join together in worship of you.
[1567.36 → 1570.60] Almighty, all-powerful God, we are in awe of you.
[1571.10 → 1575.00] We're humbled and in awe of your love and compassion and mercy to us
[1575.00 → 1577.18] who believe in the saving grace of Jesus.
[1577.98 → 1581.86] You have promised that you're slow to anger, and you're abounding in love,
[1581.86 → 1585.52] a love that's so strong that nothing can separate us from it.
[1586.74 → 1590.80] We confess that we've each sinned, and we continue to sin in our hearts
[1590.80 → 1592.84] and in the things that we say and we do.
[1593.88 → 1595.80] And through Jesus, we pray for your forgiveness.
[1596.98 → 1599.10] Holy Spirit, help us to delight in you.
[1599.24 → 1600.82] Help us to walk in your ways.
[1601.30 → 1603.62] To the glory of Jesus' name, amen.
[1611.86 → 1628.94] Do you notice and trust in you?
[1628.94 → 1638.26] Go ahead and pray for your forgiveness.
[1638.26 → 1645.30] Something vain, 풀zzling time
[1646.72 → 1651.10] The world is of temptation
[1652.62 → 1658.52] Something vain!
[1659.40 → 1663.60] More into all
[1663.60 → 1689.54] dimmer

[2026.04 → 2031.20] OUL, let me just pray in your love.
[2031.20 → 2059.22] You may be seated.
[2061.20 → 2076.70] Good morning.
[2076.70 → 2078.06] My name is Yap.
[2078.12 → 2080.58] I'm a deacon here at Langley Emanuel.
[2080.94 → 2083.68] This morning's offering will be for Night Shift Ministries.

[2089.92 → 2090.74] to those in need.
[2091.86 → 2097.26] From John 15 verse 12, my command is this, love each other as I have loved you.

[2288.98 → 2290.98] Thank you.
[2290.98 → 2293.08] Okay.
[2293.08 → 2302.84] Good morning, everybody. How's everybody? Yeah.
[2306.42 → 2309.68] Today in children's worship time, we're going to talk a little bit about creation,
[2309.86 → 2312.50] and we're going to talk a little bit about God's creation.
[2312.62 → 2316.36] And in creation, there's lots of animals and reptiles and stuff.
[2316.40 → 2319.26] Does anybody here have any pets at home? Does anybody have a dog?
[2320.14 → 2322.64] Who has a dog? Does anybody have a cat?
[2323.74 → 2327.76] Yeah. Does anybody have a pet that is not a dog or a cat?
[2327.94 → 2330.96] What do you have? A fish? How about you guys?
[2332.40 → 2335.66] A who? A goat. Cool.
[2336.94 → 2340.98] Does anybody have a gerbil or a guinea pig or any of this kind of things?
[2341.40 → 2342.98] Okay. No. What do you get?
[2344.90 → 2348.16] You're going to get a guinea pig? All right. How about you?
[2350.22 → 2352.12] You're getting a cat for your birthday. Nice.
[2352.12 → 2359.28] Well, today we're going to talk about some of our favourite animals in creation.
[2359.46 → 2365.92] But you know what? I know there are some men in this group who've got a favourite animal in creation.
[2366.40 → 2369.74] And I got a couple pictures up here. We're going to put the first picture up here.
[2369.84 → 2372.74] Look it. There are some guys in this church who like doing this kind of stuff.
[2372.78 → 2373.78] You know what that is up there?
[2374.50 → 2375.90] That's a big fish, isn't it?
[2375.90 → 2381.58] This Mr. Waltzer's up there with this big sturgeon fish.
[2382.12 → 2383.32] We got another one up there too.
[2384.24 → 2386.12] I'm up there in the middle. Look at those fish.
[2387.00 → 2387.66] Isn't that cool?
[2388.16 → 2390.32] In creation, there are lots of cool animals in there.
[2390.42 → 2393.16] And a lot of people like to go fish and a lot of the men in this church.
[2393.40 → 2395.88] So they like that kind of fish.
[2395.88 → 2400.46] So when we go in the back, we're going to talk a bit about some of the animals in creation that you guys like.
[2400.90 → 2401.94] All right? Should we do that?
[2402.40 → 2404.24] All right. Let's stand up and do the blessing.
[2407.24 → 2407.86] You guys ready?
[2407.86 → 2437.84] Good morning.
[2437.86 → 2438.22] Good morning, everybody.
[2438.78 → 2444.54] My name is Seth, and I'm an elder here at our church, and it's my privilege to lead you in our family prayer.
[2445.78 → 2452.50] Before we start, just to let you know that at the end, I would be grateful if you would join me in reciting the Lord's Prayer to wrap it up.
[2453.20 → 2453.78] Let's pray.
[2456.14 → 2464.18] God of glory, God of grace, God of power, and God of love, we thank you for the opportunity to be here this morning,
[2464.18 → 2470.84] to follow your call to gather together as your body here on earth, as this part of your body in this corner of the world.
[2470.84 → 2476.12] We thank you for your goodness and your grace.
[2476.48 → 2480.10] Thank you for the love that you've bestowed upon us this whole last week.
[2480.10 → 2486.32] And as we look ahead to this next week, we may look ahead with some fear, with some trepidation,
[2486.78 → 2488.84] maybe some excitement for things that are ahead.
[2489.58 → 2494.74] But in all of these feelings that we have, we know that you are constant, and you are always good,
[2494.74 → 2497.32] and we can put our faith and our trust in you.
[2497.32 → 2501.78] Lord, we lift our congregation to you in Thanksgiving.
[2502.46 → 2507.18] Thank you for the wonderful evidence of your spirit working in our ministries here.
[2507.90 → 2513.40] We thank you for all the volunteers, all the leaders, all the coordinators,
[2513.52 → 2517.56] and we thank you for your work in their hearts and pray that you continue to inspire,
[2518.28 → 2523.68] continue to give us a vision of what it means as Langley Emanuel to gather and go and grow.
[2523.68 → 2527.54] So, we pray where there is need in our ministries.
[2528.06 → 2530.78] We pray where we need volunteers that you will provide,
[2531.42 → 2534.66] that you will motivate people to step into those roles,
[2534.82 → 2536.80] and that you will empower them as well.
[2538.36 → 2539.82] We pray for those who mourn.
[2540.26 → 2541.58] We think of the Hogawonings.
[2541.78 → 2543.00] We also think of the DeW inters.
[2543.68 → 2547.48] And we also put our faith and trust again in you,
[2548.02 → 2551.66] knowing that you hold all things in your hands, even death.
[2551.66 → 2554.74] And we pray for comfort for those families.
[2555.28 → 2560.70] Thank you for the blessing that it has been for them to be able to witness lives of faith
[2560.70 → 2564.08] and to witness running the race well.
[2565.86 → 2569.28] Lord, we pray for SAI, that you will bring him healing,
[2569.70 → 2573.14] that you will enable his heart to have a steady and calm beat,
[2573.78 → 2576.58] that you will give him and Greta peace as well.
[2576.58 → 2580.96] Thank you for the weal things.
[2581.28 → 2586.70] Thank you for the strength and health and comfort that you have brought so far.
[2586.90 → 2589.92] And we continue to pray for the young life,
[2590.30 → 2594.84] and that you will sustain and give them hope as well,
[2595.22 → 2597.42] and rest and comfort too.
[2597.42 → 2602.14] Lord, you are good.
[2603.68 → 2605.50] And we know that we can depend on you.
[2606.62 → 2609.48] And you have even taught us how to pray, saying,
[2610.48 → 2611.10] Our Father,
[2611.10 → 2611.16] Our Father,
[2611.16 → 2630.62] how to pray,
[2630.68 → 2631.88] oh,
[2631.96 → 2635.82] how to pray,
[2635.82 → 2636.82] Amen.
[2665.82 → 2666.82] Amen.
[2695.82 → 2696.82] Amen.
[2725.82 → 2736.26] And so we are returning to the book of Romans in our teaching for now up until we begin our Advent Christmas season.
[2737.06 → 2741.98] We're going to live in Romans chapters 9 through 11.
[2741.98 → 2764.36] And before we read the first section, let me just say that chapters 9 through 11 of Romans are considered by many to be some of the hardest and most disputed chapters in the whole Bible.
[2764.36 → 2773.42] And so it's not just for temperature, but by example, I'm going to ask you all to roll up your sleeves.
[2774.72 → 2782.50] If you dig in to God's Word together, to start, we're going to read the first 13 verse.
[2782.90 → 2788.88] So if you have a Bible, I encourage you to have that open and keep it open, that word on, whatever the case can be.
[2789.76 → 2791.42] The first time through, you'll be on the screen.
[2791.42 → 2793.42] Let's pray.
[2796.86 → 2799.36] I speak the truth in Christ.
[2800.00 → 2801.04] I am not lying.
[2801.72 → 2804.78] My conscience confirms it through the Holy Spirit.
[2805.72 → 2810.56] I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.
[2810.56 → 2822.48] For I could wish that I myself will curse and cut off from Christ for the sake of my people, those of my own grace, the people of Israel.
[2823.44 → 2825.78] Theirs is the adoption of son ship.
[2826.14 → 2832.10] Theirs is the divine glory, the covenant, the receiving of the law, the temple worship, and the promises.
[2832.10 → 2844.14] Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them is grace, the human ancestry of the Messiah, who is God over all, forever praised in them.
[2844.14 → 2850.14] It is not as though God's Word has faith.
[2850.14 → 2859.92] For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel, nor because they are his descendants are they all Abraham's children.
[2861.02 → 2865.42] On contrary, it is through Isaac that your offspring was reckoned.
[2865.42 → 2875.96] In other words, it is not the children by physical descent who are God's children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham's offspring.
[2876.92 → 2880.08] For this was how the promise was stated.
[2880.74 → 2884.66] At the appointed time, I will return and Sarah will have a promise.
[2884.66 → 2891.56] Not only that, but the better children were conceived at the same time by her father Isaac.
[2892.34 → 2899.42] Yet before the twins were born, or had done anything good or bad, in order that God's purpose and election might stand,
[2899.96 → 2905.74] not by birth, but by whom he calls, she was told, the older, the third, the younger.
[2906.40 → 2911.48] Just as it is written, Jacob, I love you, but he saw you.
[2911.48 → 2935.48] I don't know if you have ever learned a musical instrument, but especially as a young child,
[2935.48 → 2941.44] learning a musical instrument can be a particular kind of challenge.
[2942.32 → 2946.64] There's very few of us, and the covalent notwithstanding,
[2947.04 → 2952.18] who can sit down at an instrument and sound like a prodigy the first time they touch it.
[2955.00 → 2957.24] It takes a lot of really hard work.
[2958.34 → 2964.38] And it can be really frustrating, and you can want to quit pretty quickly.
[2965.48 → 2968.90] And I'll be clear, I'm not talking about anyone in particular.
[2970.36 → 2978.24] But generally, it's very hard to do things that are hard, and that we don't know how to do.
[2980.02 → 2982.70] And so at that moment, you have a choice to make.
[2983.66 → 2983.94] Right?
[2984.06 → 2990.02] Will you persevere in the face of the challenge, or will you wash your hands with it and walk away?
[2990.02 → 2994.16] That kind of broke mindset.
[2995.36 → 2999.90] I want to reply to our work here in Romans 9 through 11.
[3000.96 → 3002.78] Because it's hard work.
[3003.36 → 3008.06] It's hard thinking, and it's going to be difficult for some of us.
[3008.06 → 3014.78] And there's going to be various levels of comprehension and grasping as we wrestle.
[3015.16 → 3020.78] And so, instead of washing your hands and walking away, maybe consider,
[3021.04 → 3023.40] how can I try more?
[3024.20 → 3026.24] How can I learn other?
[3026.40 → 3028.44] How can I dig deeper?
[3028.56 → 3033.92] And whether that's calling me and setting up a meeting where we can get together.
[3034.08 → 3035.86] And you can ask questions and we can talk about.
[3036.36 → 3040.54] Whether that's bringing it up in your parents or in your other Bible study groups.
[3040.78 → 3042.14] However you should do that.
[3042.28 → 3047.78] And at least for right now, agree that we're going to press into the heart.
[3047.78 → 3050.56] we're going to do the work
[3050.56 → 3052.80] that might count
[3052.80 → 3054.24] now
[3054.24 → 3056.70] to help lay the best foundation we can
[3056.70 → 3057.84] and because it has been
[3057.84 → 3060.16] I was reminded earlier today
[3060.16 → 3061.88] it has been months and months and months
[3061.88 → 3064.08] since we've looked at the book of Romans
[3064.08 → 3066.74] I'm going to do a quick survey
[3066.74 → 3069.78] for the next three to five minutes
[3069.78 → 3071.66] of where we've been
[3071.66 → 3073.66] in order to ensure
[3073.66 → 3075.86] that we're all starting from the same place
[3075.86 → 3078.48] so really quickly
[3078.48 → 3079.86] first
[3079.86 → 3082.94] Paul didn't start
[3082.94 → 3085.66] or implant the church in Rome
[3085.66 → 3087.32] so
[3087.32 → 3088.66] when he writes this letter
[3088.66 → 3090.36] it's kind of his introduction
[3090.36 → 3092.72] to them of himself
[3092.72 → 3094.90] now shortly they've heard about the apostle Paul
[3094.90 → 3096.50] because the leaders in the church of Rome
[3096.50 → 3098.42] were taught by him in other places
[3098.42 → 3100.26] and they then came to Rome
[3100.26 → 3101.90] and established the church there
[3101.90 → 3105.32] but this is his first communication
[3105.32 → 3106.56] with them
[3106.56 → 3109.24] now at the time of writing
[3109.24 → 3112.00] Paul likely didn't know
[3112.00 → 3113.46] that one day
[3113.46 → 3114.82] he would be in Rome
[3114.82 → 3115.78] as a prisoner
[3115.78 → 3117.74] in fact he would be in Rome
[3117.74 → 3118.96] as a prisoner twice
[3118.96 → 3120.82] and the second time
[3120.82 → 3121.56] in all likelihood
[3121.56 → 3122.70] he was killed
[3122.70 → 3124.32] by the emperor Nero
[3124.32 → 3126.96] during the mid-60s AD
[3126.96 → 3129.24] for being a Christian leader
[3129.24 → 3131.34] for being a teacher
[3131.34 → 3132.26] in the church
[3132.26 → 3135.02] so this letter
[3135.02 → 3136.66] is both his introduction
[3136.66 → 3139.70] and his summary
[3139.70 → 3141.84] of Christian teaching
[3141.84 → 3145.38] so the first three chapters
[3145.38 → 3146.10] of Romans
[3146.10 → 3148.30] are an example
[3148.30 → 3149.64] or an exposition
[3149.64 → 3152.64] of the pervasive truth
[3152.64 → 3153.84] and reality
[3153.84 → 3155.44] of sin
[3155.44 → 3158.94] everyone is affected
[3158.94 → 3160.16] Jew
[3160.16 → 3161.16] Gentile
[3161.16 → 3162.16] all humanity
[3162.16 → 3163.38] have fallen short
[3163.38 → 3164.74] of God's glory
[3164.74 → 3165.82] of his perfection
[3165.82 → 3168.54] and in doing so
[3168.54 → 3170.26] that we do so
[3170.26 → 3172.02] because we have exchanged
[3172.02 → 3174.14] the truth of God
[3174.14 → 3175.06] for a lie
[3175.06 → 3176.28] we've exchanged
[3176.28 → 3177.46] his purposes
[3177.46 → 3178.60] for life
[3178.60 → 3180.14] for something other
[3180.14 → 3181.48] than his design
[3181.48 → 3182.32] and a pen
[3182.32 → 3185.32] and the next four chapters
[3185.32 → 3186.14] more or less
[3186.14 → 3187.70] are chapters
[3187.70 → 3189.10] that walk us through
[3189.10 → 3190.14] the contrast
[3190.14 → 3191.54] in the law
[3191.54 → 3193.40] given to Moses
[3193.40 → 3194.56] and how it
[3194.56 → 3195.52] can fix us
[3195.52 → 3196.82] of this sin
[3196.82 → 3198.94] and faith
[3198.94 → 3200.26] by grace
[3200.26 → 3202.52] so he picks a
[3202.52 → 3206.18] he shows to us
[3206.18 → 3207.16] a character
[3207.16 → 3207.86] Adam
[3207.86 → 3209.72] as the head
[3209.72 → 3211.48] of the first group
[3211.48 → 3212.30] that is those
[3212.30 → 3213.82] who are under sin
[3213.82 → 3214.84] and under the law
[3214.84 → 3216.54] and then he contrasts
[3216.54 → 3218.02] that picture of Adam
[3218.02 → 3219.78] with the second Adam
[3219.78 → 3220.24] he calls
[3220.24 → 3221.18] with Christ
[3221.18 → 3222.20] who is Jesus
[3222.20 → 3223.72] as the head
[3223.72 → 3224.98] of the grace
[3224.98 → 3226.20] by faith
[3226.20 → 3229.00] for those of us
[3229.00 → 3230.00] in the second group
[3230.00 → 3230.98] those who belong
[3230.98 → 3231.60] to Jesus
[3231.60 → 3233.52] while we still struggle
[3233.52 → 3234.46] with sin
[3234.46 → 3235.40] and sinfulness
[3235.40 → 3236.20] in the world
[3236.20 → 3237.60] Paul makes it
[3237.60 → 3238.68] abundantly clear
[3238.68 → 3239.46] that we're no longer
[3239.46 → 3240.90] ruled by sin
[3240.90 → 3241.52] that we're no longer
[3241.52 → 3242.26] identified
[3242.26 → 3243.68] by our sin
[3243.68 → 3244.90] we're not slaves
[3244.90 → 3245.96] to sin
[3245.96 → 3247.00] the people
[3247.00 → 3247.72] Paul says
[3247.72 → 3248.18] who have been
[3248.18 → 3248.98] raised in the life
[3248.98 → 3249.48] of Jesus
[3249.48 → 3250.58] by the Holy Spirit
[3250.58 → 3251.68] are beginning
[3251.68 → 3252.52] to glitz
[3252.52 → 3253.98] God's original purpose
[3253.98 → 3255.02] for humanity
[3255.02 → 3256.94] albeit unveiled
[3256.94 → 3258.16] and still fractured
[3258.16 → 3259.02] today
[3259.02 → 3261.88] so let me build up
[3261.88 → 3263.46] chapter 8
[3263.46 → 3265.12] which becomes
[3265.12 → 3266.28] the theological
[3266.28 → 3266.98] ground
[3266.98 → 3268.26] for our new life
[3268.26 → 3268.94] in Jesus
[3268.94 → 3269.94] by the Holy Spirit
[3269.94 → 3271.60] right
[3271.60 → 3272.48] since there is
[3272.48 → 3273.94] now no condemnation
[3273.94 → 3274.56] for those
[3274.56 → 3275.78] in Christ Jesus
[3275.78 → 3276.58] we live
[3276.58 → 3277.42] according to
[3277.42 → 3277.86] the Spirit
[3277.86 → 3278.70] who raised us
[3278.70 → 3279.70] we live
[3279.70 → 3280.26] as children
[3280.26 → 3281.38] of God
[3281.38 → 3282.24] calling him
[3282.24 → 3283.06] Father
[3283.06 → 3283.88] right
[3283.88 → 3284.90] heirs of God
[3284.90 → 3286.22] and co-heirs of Christ
[3286.22 → 3288.84] and even in
[3288.84 → 3289.50] our present
[3289.50 → 3290.54] sufferings
[3290.54 → 3291.56] we can know
[3291.56 → 3292.28] that there is
[3292.28 → 3293.36] glory coming
[3293.36 → 3294.58] right
[3294.58 → 3295.76] and because
[3295.76 → 3296.54] of his
[3296.54 → 3297.58] great love
[3297.58 → 3298.68] for us
[3298.68 → 3299.98] and because
[3299.98 → 3300.68] nothing
[3300.68 → 3301.86] not anything
[3301.86 → 3303.06] no person
[3303.06 → 3303.66] or power
[3303.66 → 3304.82] or principality
[3304.82 → 3305.54] nothing
[3305.54 → 3306.68] in all creation
[3306.68 → 3307.92] can separate us
[3307.92 → 3309.02] from his love
[3309.02 → 3311.82] so out of that love
[3311.82 → 3313.58] he predestined
[3313.58 → 3315.18] now that means
[3315.18 → 3315.96] he chose
[3315.96 → 3316.80] you
[3316.80 → 3318.04] before time
[3318.04 → 3318.54] he began
[3318.54 → 3319.66] right
[3319.66 → 3321.04] out of that love
[3321.04 → 3322.58] may be called
[3322.58 → 3323.92] now that means
[3323.92 → 3325.00] he may be able
[3325.00 → 3325.74] to respond
[3325.74 → 3327.70] and out of
[3327.70 → 3329.02] that love
[3329.02 → 3330.04] he justified
[3330.04 → 3331.40] and that means
[3331.40 → 3332.92] because he responded
[3332.92 → 3333.94] you've been saved
[3333.94 → 3335.00] from sin and death
[3335.00 → 3335.64] and that moment
[3335.64 → 3337.06] out of that love
[3337.06 → 3338.00] he also
[3338.00 → 3339.14] glorified
[3339.14 → 3340.60] and that means
[3340.60 → 3341.80] he will
[3341.80 → 3342.76] and is
[3342.76 → 3344.34] preserving you
[3344.34 → 3345.26] again
[3345.26 → 3348.58] so in summary
[3348.58 → 3349.58] quick recap
[3349.58 → 3350.60] Paul said
[3350.60 → 3351.42] that
[3351.42 → 3352.94] those people
[3352.94 → 3354.06] those of us
[3354.06 → 3354.82] about whom
[3354.82 → 3355.46] he writes
[3355.46 → 3356.50] in these chapters
[3356.50 → 3357.76] are more
[3357.76 → 3359.34] than comparable
[3359.34 → 3362.18] that's who we are
[3362.18 → 3362.94] because of
[3362.94 → 3363.70] who that is
[3363.70 → 3364.58] and what that is
[3364.58 → 3366.52] that's the journey
[3366.52 → 3367.28] of Romans 1
[3367.28 → 3367.82] for faith
[3367.82 → 3369.34] and I get it
[3369.34 → 3369.92] it's a lot
[3369.92 → 3372.10] and it's awesome
[3372.10 → 3375.80] and ordinarily
[3375.80 → 3377.12] and when I say
[3377.12 → 3377.56] ordinarily
[3377.56 → 3378.36] I mean in every
[3378.36 → 3378.96] other letter
[3378.96 → 3379.52] that we have
[3379.52 → 3380.20] from Paul
[3380.20 → 3381.26] right
[3381.26 → 3382.12] he will shift
[3382.12 → 3382.92] the discussion
[3382.92 → 3384.66] about how
[3384.66 → 3385.48] we should then
[3385.48 → 3387.44] live in response
[3387.44 → 3388.68] to this amazing
[3388.68 → 3389.58] new reality
[3389.58 → 3390.96] to this truth
[3390.96 → 3391.82] that we are
[3391.82 → 3393.22] children of God
[3393.22 → 3394.18] who cry out
[3394.18 → 3395.24] and have a father
[3395.24 → 3396.10] heirs of God
[3396.10 → 3397.40] and co-heirs of Christ
[3397.40 → 3398.06] that we are more
[3398.06 → 3398.94] than conquerors
[3398.94 → 3400.08] right
[3400.08 → 3401.68] he has taken us
[3401.68 → 3402.30] on a journey
[3402.30 → 3403.32] that starts with
[3403.32 → 3404.08] our guilt
[3404.08 → 3405.22] and then he's
[3405.22 → 3405.84] discussed
[3405.84 → 3406.82] God's grace
[3406.82 → 3408.02] revealed in the gospel
[3408.02 → 3409.20] and then he finishes
[3409.20 → 3410.88] often ordinarily
[3410.88 → 3412.14] with an instruction
[3412.14 → 3413.06] on how we should
[3413.06 → 3414.20] live in gratitude
[3414.20 → 3415.34] for what God
[3415.34 → 3415.76] has done
[3415.76 → 3417.56] but that framework
[3417.56 → 3418.12] of guilt
[3418.12 → 3418.90] grace
[3418.90 → 3419.72] gratitude
[3419.72 → 3421.60] is pretty consistent
[3421.60 → 3422.14] for Paul
[3422.14 → 3422.46] right
[3422.46 → 3422.92] you've got people
[3422.92 → 3423.36] who guilt
[3423.36 → 3424.26] God's grace
[3424.26 → 3424.82] and the church
[3424.82 → 3425.82] is gratitude
[3425.82 → 3427.34] to put it
[3427.34 → 3428.56] another way
[3428.56 → 3430.36] it always
[3430.36 → 3431.26] starts
[3431.26 → 3432.70] with the indicative
[3432.70 → 3434.06] of the gospel
[3434.06 → 3435.50] that's the story
[3435.50 → 3436.92] of the gospel
[3436.92 → 3438.06] and then
[3438.06 → 3439.58] comes the imperative
[3439.58 → 3440.56] for life
[3440.56 → 3441.70] living response
[3441.70 → 3443.88] and based on
[3443.88 → 3444.74] the way chapter 8
[3444.74 → 3445.20] ends
[3445.20 → 3446.48] you would actually
[3446.48 → 3447.30] expect
[3447.30 → 3449.22] chapter 12
[3449.22 → 3450.58] to come in
[3450.58 → 3453.76] but there's this
[3453.76 → 3454.92] weird
[3454.92 → 3456.02] difficult
[3456.02 → 3456.66] happening
[3456.66 → 3458.30] in the chapter
[3458.30 → 3461.52] now not only
[3461.52 → 3462.30] do most
[3462.30 → 3463.02] scholars
[3463.02 → 3464.12] agree
[3464.12 → 3465.74] that chapters
[3465.74 → 3466.68] 9 through
[3466.68 → 3467.24] 11
[3467.24 → 3469.58] are difficult
[3469.58 → 3470.88] and seem
[3470.88 → 3471.98] out of place
[3471.98 → 3473.22] they're also
[3473.22 → 3474.44] recognized
[3474.44 → 3475.00] by most
[3475.00 → 3475.42] scholars
[3475.42 → 3476.08] to be
[3476.08 → 3477.04] one
[3477.04 → 3478.12] big
[3478.12 → 3479.02] unit
[3479.02 → 3480.96] that is
[3480.96 → 3481.54] they're meant
[3481.54 → 3482.20] to be read
[3482.20 → 3482.72] together
[3482.72 → 3484.38] so maybe
[3484.38 → 3485.22] if you're looking
[3485.22 → 3486.02] for something new
[3486.02 → 3486.62] in your personal
[3486.62 → 3487.50] devotional history
[3487.50 → 3489.22] read chapters 9
[3489.22 → 3489.88] through 11
[3489.88 → 3491.12] so that we can
[3491.12 → 3492.62] stay in this
[3492.62 → 3493.52] together
[3493.52 → 3494.60] right
[3494.60 → 3495.32] because the reality
[3495.32 → 3495.72] is
[3495.72 → 3497.16] if you focus
[3497.16 → 3497.70] too much
[3497.70 → 3498.50] on the threes
[3498.50 → 3499.86] you'll miss
[3499.86 → 3500.26] the four
[3500.26 → 3502.66] so in this
[3502.66 → 3503.08] case
[3503.08 → 3503.74] what that means
[3503.74 → 3505.18] if you read
[3505.18 → 3506.40] only chapter 9
[3506.40 → 3508.96] you might think
[3508.96 → 3509.94] that God's
[3509.94 → 3510.52] sovereignty
[3510.52 → 3512.58] makes humans
[3512.58 → 3513.46] pre-determined
[3513.46 → 3514.00] robots
[3514.00 → 3515.94] but then
[3515.94 → 3516.52] in contrast
[3516.52 → 3517.22] if you read
[3517.22 → 3518.22] only chapter 10
[3518.22 → 3519.40] you might think
[3519.40 → 3519.90] that God
[3519.90 → 3520.94] just doesn't know
[3520.94 → 3522.26] who will respond
[3522.26 → 3523.24] and he's up there
[3523.24 → 3524.26] openly waiting
[3524.26 → 3524.90] for history
[3524.90 → 3525.80] to happen
[3525.80 → 3526.62] so he can try
[3526.62 → 3527.38] out a response
[3527.38 → 3527.92] and that makes
[3527.92 → 3528.44] you are happy
[3528.44 → 3530.48] and then
[3530.48 → 3531.16] if you only
[3531.16 → 3532.66] read chapter 11
[3532.66 → 3533.28] you're going to
[3533.28 → 3533.80] end up with
[3533.80 → 3534.48] a strange
[3534.48 → 3535.16] conclusion
[3535.18 → 3536.52] about Israel
[3536.52 → 3537.70] or a strange
[3537.70 → 3538.54] conclusion
[3538.54 → 3539.12] about some
[3539.12 → 3539.64] sort of
[3539.64 → 3540.82] universalism
[3540.82 → 3542.08] that undermines
[3542.08 → 3543.56] the righteousness
[3543.56 → 3544.20] of God
[3544.20 → 3545.00] that's so clearly
[3545.00 → 3545.70] communicated
[3545.70 → 3546.40] in the first
[3546.40 → 3546.94] chapter 12
[3546.94 → 3549.52] so
[3549.52 → 3551.48] even as we
[3551.48 → 3552.46] have rolled up
[3552.46 → 3553.18] our sleeves
[3553.18 → 3554.48] and are looking
[3554.48 → 3555.20] at these chapters
[3555.20 → 3555.68] over the next
[3555.68 → 3556.40] couple of weeks
[3556.40 → 3557.72] keep in mind
[3557.72 → 3558.92] this overarching
[3558.92 → 3560.30] theme and role
[3560.30 → 3561.72] of this dense
[3561.72 → 3562.72] and important
[3562.72 → 3563.38] section
[3563.38 → 3565.20] of Romans
[3565.20 → 3567.02] and with that
[3567.02 → 3567.34] in mind
[3567.34 → 3568.24] one last
[3568.24 → 3568.94] big picture
[3568.94 → 3569.72] goal comment
[3569.72 → 3570.90] here it will
[3570.90 → 3571.28] be helpful
[3571.28 → 3571.98] about the world
[3571.98 → 3572.44] although I
[3572.44 → 3572.88] think you can
[3572.88 → 3573.24] get it
[3573.24 → 3573.96] on screen
[3573.96 → 3575.30] even though
[3575.30 → 3576.14] chapters 9
[3576.14 → 3576.72] through 11
[3576.72 → 3577.86] are super tough
[3577.86 → 3578.78] and sometimes
[3578.78 → 3579.58] really dense
[3579.58 → 3580.20] theology
[3580.20 → 3580.66] and they have
[3580.66 → 3581.24] been debated
[3581.24 → 3582.80] for generations
[3582.80 → 3584.86] look at how
[3584.86 → 3585.98] chapter 11
[3585.98 → 3586.82] ends
[3586.82 → 3588.92] chapter 11
[3588.92 → 3589.32] ends
[3589.32 → 3590.62] in verse 33
[3590.62 → 3591.08] with
[3591.08 → 3592.64] oh the depths
[3592.64 → 3593.36] of the riches
[3593.36 → 3594.32] of the wisdom
[3594.32 → 3595.14] and knowledge
[3595.14 → 3595.80] of God
[3595.80 → 3597.08] how unsearchable
[3597.08 → 3597.72] this judgment
[3597.72 → 3598.92] and this path
[3598.92 → 3599.72] beyond crazy
[3599.72 → 3600.08] count
[3600.08 → 3601.30] who has
[3601.30 → 3601.78] known the
[3601.78 → 3602.12] mind
[3602.12 → 3602.62] the Lord
[3602.62 → 3603.30] who has
[3603.30 → 3603.56] been
[3603.56 → 3604.20] counsellor
[3604.20 → 3605.02] who has
[3605.02 → 3605.64] ever given
[3605.64 → 3606.20] to God
[3606.20 → 3606.72] that God
[3606.72 → 3607.34] should repay
[3607.34 → 3607.60] him
[3607.60 → 3608.84] for from
[3608.84 → 3609.16] him
[3609.16 → 3610.08] and through
[3610.08 → 3610.44] him
[3610.44 → 3611.28] and for
[3611.28 → 3611.90] him are
[3611.90 → 3613.22] all things
[3613.22 → 3613.90] to him
[3613.90 → 3615.26] be glory
[3615.26 → 3616.34] forever
[3616.34 → 3618.02] amen
[3618.02 → 3621.70] the exalting
[3621.70 → 3622.62] in God's
[3622.62 → 3623.30] sovereignty
[3623.30 → 3624.46] and then
[3624.46 → 3625.38] the exposition
[3625.38 → 3626.36] of human
[3626.36 → 3626.82] mission
[3626.82 → 3627.32] and our
[3627.32 → 3628.12] responsibility
[3628.12 → 3628.64] and God's
[3628.64 → 3628.94] plan
[3628.94 → 3629.56] and then
[3629.56 → 3630.48] the exclamation
[3630.48 → 3631.48] of God's
[3631.48 → 3631.86] promises
[3631.86 → 3632.48] to all
[3632.48 → 3633.22] his people
[3633.22 → 3634.18] chapters 9
[3634.18 → 3635.08] 10 and 11
[3635.08 → 3636.12] all of that
[3636.12 → 3636.40] together
[3636.40 → 3637.46] causes Paul
[3637.46 → 3638.32] to seemingly
[3638.32 → 3639.40] spontaneously
[3639.40 → 3640.58] break out
[3640.58 → 3641.24] in worship
[3641.24 → 3643.78] you've heard
[3643.78 → 3644.14] me say
[3644.14 → 3644.58] before
[3644.58 → 3647.12] that all
[3647.12 → 3647.94] would be
[3647.94 → 3648.38] theology
[3648.38 → 3649.88] leads to
[3649.88 → 3650.88] doxology
[3650.88 → 3653.32] all good
[3653.32 → 3653.92] theology
[3653.92 → 3654.56] studying
[3654.56 → 3655.10] of God
[3655.10 → 3655.92] leads to
[3655.92 → 3656.90] doxology
[3656.90 → 3657.50] giving and
[3657.50 → 3657.80] praise
[3657.80 → 3659.36] learning
[3659.36 → 3659.88] something
[3659.88 → 3660.28] of the
[3660.28 → 3660.66] depths
[3660.66 → 3661.48] and riches
[3661.48 → 3661.98] of God
[3661.98 → 3662.74] moves us
[3662.74 → 3663.08] or just
[3663.08 → 3663.64] ought to
[3663.64 → 3664.50] move our
[3664.50 → 3664.90] hearts
[3664.90 → 3666.02] to worship
[3666.02 → 3666.72] him
[3666.72 → 3668.12] and so
[3668.12 → 3668.54] with all
[3668.54 → 3669.00] of our
[3669.00 → 3669.70] learning
[3669.70 → 3670.00] and the
[3670.00 → 3670.52] whole work
[3670.52 → 3671.18] of theology
[3671.18 → 3671.78] that we do
[3671.78 → 3672.40] don't
[3672.40 → 3672.86] forget
[3672.86 → 3674.16] that
[3674.16 → 3674.54] all
[3674.54 → 3675.26] is
[3675.26 → 3676.12] praise
[3676.12 → 3678.38] we will
[3678.38 → 3678.88] keep on
[3678.88 → 3679.22] sinning
[3679.22 → 3679.60] like we
[3679.60 → 3679.82] can
[3679.82 → 3680.02] our
[3680.02 → 3680.38] service
[3680.38 → 3680.84] hold
[3680.84 → 3681.82] hold
[3681.82 → 3682.78] hold
[3682.78 → 3682.88] hold
[3682.88 → 3685.08] even as
[3685.08 → 3685.66] some of
[3685.66 → 3685.96] what we
[3685.96 → 3686.70] learn are
[3686.70 → 3687.60] and may
[3687.60 → 3688.18] not yet
[3688.18 → 3688.56] change
[3688.56 → 3692.40] as we
[3692.40 → 3692.60] do
[3692.60 → 3695.88] notice
[3695.88 → 3698.12] chapter 9
[3698.12 → 3699.18] verse 6
[3699.18 → 3701.00] really gives
[3701.00 → 3702.00] us the theme
[3702.00 → 3703.44] for all of
[3703.44 → 3704.12] chapter 9
[3704.12 → 3704.50] 10
[3704.50 → 3705.22] and 11
[3705.22 → 3705.68] together
[3705.68 → 3706.24] and it's
[3706.24 → 3707.00] the focus
[3707.00 → 3707.64] of our
[3707.64 → 3708.38] first look
[3708.38 → 3709.22] today
[3709.22 → 3710.66] Paul
[3710.66 → 3710.68] Paul
[3710.68 → 3711.10] prevents
[3711.10 → 3711.94] that theme
[3711.94 → 3713.32] in the
[3713.32 → 3713.84] form of
[3713.84 → 3714.46] a statement
[3714.46 → 3715.92] he says
[3715.92 → 3716.60] in verse 6
[3716.60 → 3717.42] it is not
[3717.42 → 3718.08] as though
[3718.08 → 3719.22] God's word
[3719.22 → 3720.80] has failed
[3720.80 → 3723.58] God's word
[3723.58 → 3724.54] doesn't
[3724.54 → 3725.48] fail
[3725.48 → 3726.40] that's the
[3726.40 → 3726.60] point
[3726.60 → 3727.08] that's the
[3727.08 → 3728.04] big idea
[3728.04 → 3728.52] of this whole
[3728.52 → 3728.86] section
[3728.86 → 3730.36] and to be
[3730.36 → 3730.76] clear
[3730.76 → 3731.82] when Paul
[3731.82 → 3732.74] here says
[3732.74 → 3733.44] that God's
[3733.44 → 3733.72] word
[3733.72 → 3734.40] doesn't
[3734.40 → 3734.96] fail
[3734.96 → 3736.10] he's talking
[3736.10 → 3736.84] about
[3736.84 → 3737.96] that God's
[3737.96 → 3738.48] promises
[3738.48 → 3740.34] promise
[3740.34 → 3740.84] that was
[3740.84 → 3741.80] first spoken
[3741.80 → 3742.78] to Adam
[3742.78 → 3743.28] but then
[3743.28 → 3743.78] that was
[3743.78 → 3744.50] focused
[3744.50 → 3745.06] in the
[3745.06 → 3745.42] person
[3745.42 → 3746.12] of Abraham
[3746.12 → 3746.94] and then
[3746.94 → 3747.74] from Abraham
[3747.74 → 3748.76] was expanded
[3748.76 → 3749.62] wide
[3749.62 → 3749.96] to be
[3749.96 → 3750.32] for all
[3750.32 → 3750.84] of Israel
[3750.84 → 3752.88] really
[3752.88 → 3753.44] Paul
[3753.44 → 3754.78] is an
[3754.78 → 3755.56] excellent
[3755.56 → 3756.40] teacher
[3756.40 → 3756.92] and
[3756.92 → 3757.86] rhetorician
[3757.86 → 3758.80] and he's
[3758.80 → 3759.82] anticipating
[3759.82 → 3760.52] a kind
[3760.52 → 3761.18] of question
[3761.18 → 3762.46] there's
[3762.46 → 3763.64] a sort
[3763.64 → 3764.44] of rhetorical
[3764.44 → 3764.96] question
[3764.96 → 3765.54] that Paul
[3765.54 → 3767.20] is anticipating
[3767.20 → 3768.48] that kind
[3768.48 → 3768.56] of
[3768.56 → 3769.06] is structured
[3769.06 → 3769.66] like this
[3769.66 → 3771.60] if
[3771.60 → 3772.26] as you
[3772.26 → 3772.68] have said
[3772.68 → 3773.08] Paul
[3773.08 → 3773.68] nothing
[3773.68 → 3774.34] can ever
[3774.34 → 3774.70] ever
[3774.70 → 3775.58] separate us
[3775.58 → 3776.08] from the
[3776.08 → 3776.60] love of
[3776.60 → 3777.00] God
[3777.00 → 3778.12] and
[3778.12 → 3778.84] if
[3778.84 → 3779.54] as you
[3779.54 → 3780.02] have said
[3780.02 → 3780.44] Paul
[3780.44 → 3780.82] God
[3780.82 → 3781.22] chose
[3781.22 → 3781.78] Israel
[3781.78 → 3782.30] to be
[3782.30 → 3782.96] his people
[3782.96 → 3783.42] for the
[3783.42 → 3783.84] world
[3783.84 → 3784.86] and
[3784.86 → 3785.72] since
[3785.72 → 3786.40] what we
[3786.40 → 3786.90] see
[3786.90 → 3787.84] in this
[3787.84 → 3788.40] life
[3788.40 → 3789.12] and moment
[3789.12 → 3789.58] is that
[3789.58 → 3790.32] the majority
[3790.32 → 3791.06] of
[3791.06 → 3791.74] the
[3791.74 → 3792.76] Jews
[3792.76 → 3793.28] have
[3793.28 → 3794.02] rejected
[3794.02 → 3794.56] Jesus
[3794.56 → 3794.96] as
[3794.96 → 3795.50] Messiah
[3795.50 → 3796.28] and God
[3796.28 → 3797.26] then
[3797.26 → 3797.90] therefore
[3797.90 → 3798.84] either
[3798.84 → 3800.02] God's
[3800.02 → 3800.56] love
[3800.56 → 3801.30] has
[3801.30 → 3802.24] failed
[3802.24 → 3803.20] and someone
[3803.20 → 3804.12] was separated
[3804.12 → 3804.88] from him
[3804.88 → 3805.80] or
[3805.80 → 3806.74] God's
[3806.74 → 3807.38] promise
[3807.38 → 3808.16] has
[3808.16 → 3808.70] failed
[3808.70 → 3809.52] or it's
[3809.52 → 3809.92] wrong
[3809.92 → 3810.82] or it's
[3810.82 → 3811.28] a lie
[3811.28 → 3812.50] or more
[3812.50 → 3812.94] likely
[3812.94 → 3813.96] both of
[3813.96 → 3814.26] those things
[3814.26 → 3814.52] have
[3814.52 → 3816.56] that's
[3816.56 → 3817.26] the challenge
[3817.26 → 3817.76] that is
[3817.76 → 3818.94] brought
[3818.94 → 3819.50] to Paul
[3819.50 → 3820.34] as he
[3820.34 → 3820.88] worked
[3820.88 → 3821.42] through
[3821.42 → 3822.20] to this
[3822.20 → 3822.62] point
[3822.62 → 3823.64] in his life
[3823.64 → 3824.52] and Paul's
[3824.52 → 3825.00] response
[3825.00 → 3826.10] is empathetic
[3826.10 → 3826.94] and definitive
[3826.94 → 3827.46] he says
[3827.46 → 3827.92] no
[3827.92 → 3829.08] no
[3829.08 → 3829.60] God's
[3829.60 → 3829.76] word
[3829.76 → 3830.20] has
[3830.20 → 3830.78] not
[3830.78 → 3831.38] failed
[3831.38 → 3831.84] God's
[3831.84 → 3832.18] promise
[3832.18 → 3832.88] is still
[3832.88 → 3833.62] true
[3833.62 → 3834.60] just
[3834.60 → 3835.16] not
[3835.16 → 3835.72] maybe
[3835.72 → 3836.74] in the
[3836.74 → 3836.98] way
[3836.98 → 3837.40] you first
[3837.40 → 3837.74] thought
[3837.74 → 3839.10] or maybe
[3839.10 → 3839.48] in the way
[3839.48 → 3840.02] you assumed
[3840.02 → 3840.84] it happened
[3840.84 → 3842.76] to make
[3842.76 → 3843.34] this point
[3843.34 → 3844.48] let's start
[3844.48 → 3845.10] at the beginning
[3845.10 → 3847.16] verse 1
[3847.16 → 3848.60] Paul said
[3848.60 → 3850.28] I speak
[3850.28 → 3850.88] the truth
[3850.88 → 3851.74] in Christ
[3851.74 → 3852.48] I am
[3852.48 → 3853.08] it online
[3853.08 → 3853.90] my conscience
[3853.90 → 3855.20] confirms it
[3855.20 → 3855.72] through
[3855.72 → 3856.44] the Holy
[3856.44 → 3856.96] Spirit
[3856.96 → 3858.94] to put it
[3858.94 → 3859.50] colloquially
[3859.50 → 3860.58] this is Paul's
[3860.58 → 3861.14] way of saying
[3861.14 → 3861.72] for real
[3861.72 → 3863.54] this is
[3863.54 → 3864.00] true
[3864.00 → 3866.26] I'm
[3866.26 → 3867.76] going to
[3867.76 → 3868.64] embarrass myself
[3868.64 → 3869.02] but now
[3869.02 → 3869.66] I might say
[3869.66 → 3870.32] no path
[3870.32 → 3872.84] did I get
[3872.84 → 3873.30] that right
[3873.30 → 3876.06] did you get
[3876.06 → 3876.54] that right
[3876.54 → 3877.04] you know
[3877.04 → 3877.56] you're even
[3877.56 → 3877.88] older
[3877.88 → 3880.32] I have no
[3880.32 → 3880.62] idea
[3880.62 → 3881.18] either
[3881.18 → 3882.24] the point
[3882.24 → 3882.84] is Paul
[3882.84 → 3883.22] to say
[3883.22 → 3883.92] this is
[3883.92 → 3884.36] true
[3884.36 → 3886.34] for real
[3886.34 → 3887.02] this is
[3887.02 → 3887.90] who God
[3887.90 → 3888.22] is
[3888.22 → 3888.82] for real
[3888.82 → 3889.32] this is
[3889.32 → 3889.76] what God
[3889.76 → 3890.26] has done
[3890.26 → 3891.34] it's really
[3891.34 → 3891.78] true
[3891.78 → 3892.44] there really
[3892.44 → 3893.24] is nothing
[3893.24 → 3893.66] that can
[3893.66 → 3894.44] separate us
[3894.44 → 3894.94] from the love
[3894.94 → 3895.36] of God
[3895.36 → 3896.38] in Christ
[3896.38 → 3896.98] Jesus
[3896.98 → 3898.20] and then
[3898.20 → 3898.42] Paul
[3898.42 → 3898.88] adds
[3898.88 → 3900.14] my conscience
[3900.14 → 3901.10] confirms it
[3901.10 → 3901.86] by the Holy
[3901.86 → 3902.26] Spirit
[3902.26 → 3903.84] that is
[3903.84 → 3904.90] he knows
[3904.90 → 3905.70] it's true
[3905.70 → 3906.64] in his mind
[3906.64 → 3907.36] and soul
[3907.36 → 3908.24] that the Holy
[3908.24 → 3908.80] Spirit
[3908.80 → 3910.06] confirms it
[3910.06 → 3910.84] to him
[3910.84 → 3913.12] so I was
[3913.12 → 3913.54] thinking about
[3913.54 → 3913.74] it
[3913.74 → 3914.88] I was reminded
[3914.88 → 3915.64] that one of
[3915.64 → 3916.28] the ways
[3916.28 → 3916.86] the High
[3916.86 → 3917.12] Leopard
[3917.12 → 3917.84] Catechism
[3917.84 → 3919.52] defines faith
[3919.52 → 3920.10] the High
[3920.10 → 3920.26] Leopard
[3920.26 → 3921.02] Catechism
[3921.02 → 3923.52] is a document
[3923.52 → 3924.42] that comes
[3924.42 → 3925.46] to our church
[3925.46 → 3926.04] from the
[3926.04 → 3927.20] 16th century
[3927.20 → 3928.00] churches
[3928.00 → 3930.08] in Geneva
[3930.08 → 3931.04] Switzerland
[3931.04 → 3931.58] and the
[3931.58 → 3932.18] Netherlands
[3932.18 → 3933.54] as a summary
[3933.54 → 3934.08] of the
[3934.08 → 3934.56] Reformed
[3934.56 → 3934.94] faith
[3934.94 → 3936.30] and one
[3936.30 → 3936.86] of the ways
[3936.86 → 3937.16] the High
[3937.16 → 3937.36] Leopard
[3937.36 → 3937.94] Catechism
[3937.94 → 3939.28] defines faith
[3939.28 → 3941.00] is as a
[3941.00 → 3941.76] whole heart
[3941.76 → 3942.48] of trust
[3942.48 → 3943.36] which the
[3943.36 → 3944.18] Holy Spirit
[3944.18 → 3945.12] creates in
[3945.12 → 3946.02] me by
[3946.02 → 3946.34] God
[3946.34 → 3949.04] so the
[3949.04 → 3949.92] Holy Spirit
[3949.92 → 3950.82] speaks to
[3950.82 → 3951.10] our
[3951.10 → 3951.84] consciences
[3951.84 → 3953.10] as a way
[3953.10 → 3954.28] of affirming
[3954.28 → 3954.92] the truth
[3954.92 → 3955.46] of God's
[3955.46 → 3955.76] word
[3955.76 → 3957.54] Paul's
[3957.54 → 3958.24] experiencing
[3958.24 → 3958.78] that in
[3958.78 → 3959.36] this moment
[3959.36 → 3959.92] right here
[3959.92 → 3960.74] right now
[3960.74 → 3961.92] and he
[3961.92 → 3962.38] will say
[3962.38 → 3963.98] you experience
[3963.98 → 3964.56] that same
[3964.56 → 3964.90] thing
[3964.90 → 3965.98] every time
[3965.98 → 3967.14] you trust
[3967.14 → 3968.10] in the face
[3968.10 → 3968.56] of fear
[3968.56 → 3970.24] right every
[3970.24 → 3970.74] time you
[3970.74 → 3971.72] believe in
[3971.72 → 3972.10] the face
[3972.10 → 3972.60] of doubt
[3972.60 → 3973.80] right every
[3973.80 → 3975.18] time what
[3975.18 → 3975.86] you see in
[3975.86 → 3976.60] front of you
[3976.60 → 3977.26] either the
[3977.26 → 3977.96] world or
[3977.96 → 3978.68] your reason
[3978.68 → 3979.32] tells you
[3979.32 → 3979.94] should not
[3979.94 → 3980.64] make sense
[3980.64 → 3981.42] or should
[3981.42 → 3981.90] not come
[3981.90 → 3982.36] together
[3982.36 → 3983.04] or you
[3983.04 → 3983.62] should not
[3983.62 → 3984.18] agree with
[3984.18 → 3984.54] or you
[3984.54 → 3984.98] should not
[3984.98 → 3985.42] believe
[3985.42 → 3986.40] and yet you
[3986.40 → 3986.94] still do
[3986.94 → 3987.78] every time
[3987.78 → 3988.42] that happens
[3988.42 → 3988.92] that's
[3988.92 → 3989.60] Holy Spirit
[3989.60 → 3990.78] confirming
[3990.78 → 3991.68] the truth
[3991.68 → 3992.50] of God's
[3992.50 → 3992.76] word
[3992.76 → 3993.20] in your
[3993.20 → 3994.16] conscience
[3994.16 → 3998.08] has anyone
[3998.08 → 3998.60] ever asked
[3998.60 → 3998.84] you
[3998.84 → 4000.52] why are
[4000.52 → 4000.84] you a
[4000.84 → 4001.14] Christian
[4001.14 → 4002.76] and in
[4002.76 → 4003.46] that moment
[4003.46 → 4004.66] right all
[4004.66 → 4005.22] you can
[4005.22 → 4006.40] say is
[4006.40 → 4007.50] I don't
[4007.50 → 4007.88] know
[4007.88 → 4009.20] like I
[4009.20 → 4009.54] stand
[4009.54 → 4011.72] I don't
[4011.72 → 4012.20] know why
[4012.20 → 4012.78] exactly
[4012.78 → 4013.68] I just
[4013.68 → 4014.04] believe
[4014.04 → 4016.48] that's the
[4016.48 → 4017.28] Holy Spirit
[4017.28 → 4018.56] confirming
[4018.56 → 4019.58] the truth
[4019.58 → 4020.24] the gospel
[4020.24 → 4021.48] in your
[4021.48 → 4021.86] heart
[4021.86 → 4022.38] and in
[4022.38 → 4022.82] your mind
[4022.82 → 4024.86] now I
[4024.86 → 4025.12] want to be
[4025.12 → 4025.74] really clear
[4025.74 → 4026.92] right like I
[4026.92 → 4027.46] don't want you
[4027.46 → 4028.22] to stay in
[4028.22 → 4028.70] that place
[4028.70 → 4029.06] where that's
[4029.06 → 4029.38] your only
[4029.38 → 4029.78] answer
[4029.78 → 4031.84] but if that's
[4031.84 → 4032.18] your only
[4032.18 → 4032.62] answer
[4032.62 → 4033.64] that's alright
[4033.64 → 4034.94] that's the
[4034.94 → 4035.54] Holy Spirit
[4035.54 → 4036.96] working in you
[4036.96 → 4037.84] right you also
[4037.84 → 4038.82] don't need any
[4038.82 → 4039.76] other explanation
[4039.76 → 4041.18] the Holy Spirit
[4041.18 → 4042.12] confirms it
[4042.12 → 4046.56] now of course
[4046.56 → 4046.96] in your
[4046.96 → 4047.52] conversation
[4047.52 → 4048.18] the person
[4048.18 → 4048.70] who asks you
[4048.70 → 4049.16] that's not
[4049.16 → 4049.88] going to make
[4049.88 → 4050.58] sense to the
[4050.58 → 4051.02] unbeliever
[4051.02 → 4051.46] that's not
[4051.46 → 4052.28] going to add
[4052.28 → 4052.72] up to the
[4052.72 → 4053.18] person who
[4053.18 → 4053.88] doesn't yet
[4053.88 → 4054.50] have the
[4054.50 → 4055.24] Holy Spirit
[4055.24 → 4056.98] but when you
[4056.98 → 4057.68] say you have
[4057.68 → 4059.02] to be
[4059.02 → 4060.54] that it's
[4060.54 → 4061.48] your conscience
[4061.48 → 4063.40] being confirmed
[4063.40 → 4064.16] by the word
[4064.16 → 4065.76] of the Holy Spirit
[4065.76 → 4069.02] then Paul
[4069.02 → 4070.86] invites us
[4070.86 → 4071.76] into the
[4071.76 → 4072.48] anguish
[4072.48 → 4073.70] of his
[4073.70 → 4074.60] heart
[4074.60 → 4074.90] right
[4074.90 → 4075.78] the sorrow
[4075.78 → 4076.52] of his
[4076.52 → 4076.92] soul
[4076.92 → 4079.24] sometimes
[4079.24 → 4080.36] a lot of
[4080.36 → 4080.78] here people
[4080.78 → 4081.54] talk about
[4081.54 → 4082.56] the writings
[4082.56 → 4082.88] of the
[4082.88 → 4083.70] Apostle Paul
[4083.70 → 4085.16] or even
[4085.16 → 4086.16] just reading
[4086.16 → 4086.70] the Bible
[4086.70 → 4087.36] generally
[4087.36 → 4088.34] as a kind
[4088.34 → 4089.02] of dry
[4089.02 → 4089.86] and dusty
[4089.86 → 4090.54] book
[4090.54 → 4092.28] that's not
[4092.28 → 4092.60] what we
[4092.60 → 4093.10] do here
[4093.10 → 4094.68] right here
[4094.68 → 4095.04] is a
[4095.04 → 4095.62] heartbroken
[4095.62 → 4096.46] man who
[4096.46 → 4097.30] betrayed all
[4097.30 → 4097.86] the promises
[4097.86 → 4098.90] of God
[4098.90 → 4099.90] who betrayed
[4099.90 → 4100.66] all the truths
[4100.66 → 4101.20] that he had
[4101.20 → 4101.74] received
[4101.74 → 4102.72] who betrayed
[4102.72 → 4104.02] his very own
[4104.02 → 4104.66] encounter
[4104.66 → 4105.60] with the
[4105.60 → 4106.66] living Jesus
[4106.66 → 4107.84] onto Damascus
[4107.84 → 4108.06] road
[4108.06 → 4108.54] who betrayed
[4108.54 → 4109.44] all of that
[4109.44 → 4110.18] to save
[4110.18 → 4110.70] his brothers
[4110.70 → 4111.26] and sisters
[4111.26 → 4112.24] right this
[4112.24 → 4113.20] is a profound
[4113.20 → 4114.08] love
[4114.08 → 4114.60] there's nothing
[4114.60 → 4115.84] dry or dusty
[4115.84 → 4116.40] about the
[4116.40 → 4117.22] Apostle Paul
[4117.22 → 4117.82] here
[4117.82 → 4118.88] he says
[4118.88 → 4119.80] for I
[4119.80 → 4120.64] wish that I
[4120.64 → 4121.20] myself
[4121.20 → 4121.88] were cursed
[4121.88 → 4122.68] and cut off
[4122.68 → 4123.22] from Christ
[4123.22 → 4123.66] for the
[4123.66 → 4124.70] sake of my
[4124.70 → 4125.66] own people
[4125.66 → 4126.98] those of
[4126.98 → 4127.66] my own
[4127.66 → 4128.72] sin
[4128.72 → 4132.66] and that
[4132.66 → 4133.42] kind of
[4133.42 → 4134.02] heart
[4134.02 → 4135.26] for people
[4135.26 → 4135.86] to know
[4135.86 → 4136.40] Christ
[4136.40 → 4137.56] is so
[4137.56 → 4138.60] compelling
[4138.60 → 4143.00] and let's
[4143.00 → 4143.36] have the
[4143.36 → 4143.80] opportunity
[4143.80 → 4145.66] to talk
[4145.66 → 4145.98] to
[4145.98 → 4146.98] someone
[4146.98 → 4147.18] who
[4147.18 → 4147.30] had
[4147.30 → 4147.66] become
[4147.66 → 4148.04] the
[4148.04 → 4148.90] head
[4148.90 → 4149.08] of
[4149.08 → 4149.20] a
[4149.20 → 4149.58] missionary
[4149.58 → 4150.22] agency
[4150.22 → 4153.26] before that
[4153.26 → 4153.66] he had
[4153.66 → 4154.48] served
[4154.48 → 4154.94] in
[4154.94 → 4155.40] Nepal
[4155.40 → 4156.78] now in
[4156.78 → 4157.22] Nepal
[4157.22 → 4159.16] if you
[4159.16 → 4159.92] convert to
[4159.92 → 4160.54] Christianity
[4160.54 → 4162.58] or if you
[4162.58 → 4163.06] talk to
[4163.06 → 4163.72] people about
[4163.72 → 4164.48] converting to
[4164.48 → 4164.98] Christianity
[4164.98 → 4166.16] you will
[4166.16 → 4167.30] receive up to
[4167.30 → 4168.18] five years in
[4168.18 → 4169.44] prison and a
[4169.44 → 4170.94] $50,000 in
[4170.94 → 4171.30] Polly
[4171.30 → 4171.92] Ruby
[4171.92 → 4173.56] fine that
[4173.56 → 4173.90] works up
[4173.90 → 4174.50] about $700
[4174.50 → 4175.18] a day
[4175.18 → 4177.18] if you're a
[4177.18 → 4178.06] foreign national
[4178.06 → 4179.10] who does that
[4179.10 → 4179.86] you will be
[4179.86 → 4180.40] deported
[4180.40 → 4181.24] immediately
[4181.24 → 4183.20] and your visa
[4183.20 → 4183.64] will be
[4183.64 → 4184.02] permanent
[4184.02 → 4184.54] suspended
[4184.54 → 4186.34] the last
[4186.34 → 4187.22] time this
[4187.22 → 4188.26] man went
[4188.26 → 4189.40] to Nepal
[4189.40 → 4190.18] he was
[4190.18 → 4190.68] kicked out
[4190.68 → 4190.94] of the
[4190.94 → 4191.26] country
[4191.26 → 4193.36] and that's
[4193.36 → 4193.64] why he
[4193.64 → 4193.96] took the
[4193.96 → 4194.34] job
[4194.34 → 4195.10] of being
[4195.10 → 4195.60] ahead of
[4195.60 → 4195.68] the
[4195.68 → 4195.98] people
[4195.98 → 4196.96] and as
[4196.96 → 4197.26] he and
[4197.26 → 4197.54] I were
[4197.54 → 4198.12] talking
[4198.12 → 4199.10] his heart
[4199.10 → 4199.94] was breaking
[4199.94 → 4200.84] from these
[4200.84 → 4201.28] Nepalese
[4201.28 → 4201.70] people
[4201.70 → 4203.10] and there
[4203.10 → 4203.58] he was
[4203.58 → 4204.54] through tears
[4204.54 → 4206.04] wishing that
[4206.04 → 4206.48] he could go
[4206.48 → 4206.92] back to
[4206.92 → 4207.06] them
[4207.06 → 4208.10] wishing that
[4208.10 → 4208.62] he could be
[4208.62 → 4209.24] in their midst
[4209.24 → 4209.70] again
[4209.70 → 4211.06] sharing Jesus
[4211.06 → 4212.28] revealing God
[4212.28 → 4215.10] and let's
[4215.10 → 4215.94] be honest
[4215.94 → 4216.18] right
[4216.18 → 4217.34] maybe it's
[4217.34 → 4217.88] not as
[4217.88 → 4218.62] far-reaching
[4218.62 → 4219.00] as
[4219.00 → 4219.46] global
[4219.46 → 4219.94] missions
[4219.94 → 4220.74] to the
[4220.74 → 4221.06] Nepal
[4221.06 → 4221.38] and
[4221.38 → 4221.96] unreached
[4221.96 → 4222.32] people
[4222.32 → 4222.74] groups
[4222.74 → 4223.86] maybe it's
[4223.86 → 4224.28] closer to
[4224.28 → 4224.52] home
[4224.52 → 4226.86] or maybe
[4226.86 → 4227.24] as you're
[4227.24 → 4227.80] sitting here
[4227.80 → 4228.18] you're thinking
[4228.18 → 4228.60] about your
[4228.60 → 4228.98] friends
[4228.98 → 4229.86] and your
[4229.86 → 4230.60] heart breaks
[4230.60 → 4231.14] for your
[4231.14 → 4231.72] friends to
[4231.72 → 4232.36] know Jesus
[4232.36 → 4233.00] in the way
[4233.00 → 4233.84] that you do
[4233.84 → 4235.50] we got a little
[4235.50 → 4236.08] glimpse of that
[4236.08 → 4236.58] last week
[4236.58 → 4237.02] when Isaac
[4237.02 → 4237.64] stood up here
[4237.64 → 4238.04] in front of
[4238.04 → 4238.16] us
[4238.16 → 4238.66] driving and
[4238.66 → 4238.92] shared
[4238.92 → 4239.68] his testimony
[4239.68 → 4240.32] and his
[4240.32 → 4241.04] longing for
[4241.04 → 4241.58] others to
[4241.58 → 4242.32] see the same
[4242.32 → 4243.00] that he is
[4243.00 → 4243.72] seeing God
[4243.72 → 4245.04] what a beautiful
[4245.04 → 4245.42] thing
[4245.42 → 4245.86] and again
[4245.86 → 4247.82] thank you for
[4247.82 → 4248.12] sharing
[4248.12 → 4250.20] that we
[4250.20 → 4250.94] want these
[4250.94 → 4251.58] people in
[4251.58 → 4252.40] our lives
[4252.40 → 4253.78] to know
[4253.78 → 4254.70] Jesus
[4254.70 → 4256.26] and parents
[4256.26 → 4256.60] right
[4256.60 → 4256.96] you know
[4256.96 → 4257.34] this too
[4257.34 → 4258.42] maybe some
[4258.42 → 4258.70] of your
[4258.70 → 4259.22] kids have
[4259.22 → 4259.86] left church
[4259.86 → 4261.48] or maybe
[4261.48 → 4262.14] some of them
[4262.14 → 4262.90] are in
[4262.90 → 4263.44] university
[4263.44 → 4264.06] right now
[4264.06 → 4265.06] and you're
[4265.06 → 4265.90] really concerned
[4265.90 → 4266.42] for their
[4266.42 → 4267.28] faith life
[4267.28 → 4267.72] or their
[4267.72 → 4268.28] lack of
[4268.28 → 4268.46] their
[4268.46 → 4268.94] expressed
[4268.94 → 4270.16] faith life
[4270.16 → 4271.44] you know
[4271.44 → 4271.86] this
[4271.86 → 4272.76] longing
[4272.76 → 4274.08] you know
[4274.08 → 4274.70] this
[4274.70 → 4276.04] desire
[4276.04 → 4285.22] the truth
[4285.22 → 4288.12] the truth
[4288.12 → 4288.62] that breaks
[4288.62 → 4289.38] my heart
[4289.38 → 4293.68] is that some
[4293.68 → 4293.92] of you
[4293.92 → 4294.48] sitting here
[4294.48 → 4295.04] right now
[4295.04 → 4296.92] are asking
[4296.92 → 4297.46] these questions
[4297.46 → 4298.18] for yourself
[4298.18 → 4299.84] but you'll
[4299.84 → 4300.28] never ask
[4300.28 → 4300.44] that
[4300.44 → 4300.74] out
[4300.74 → 4302.66] you'll
[4302.66 → 4303.08] never reach
[4303.08 → 4303.36] out
[4303.36 → 4304.80] and talk
[4304.80 → 4305.12] to someone
[4305.12 → 4307.30] the truth
[4307.30 → 4307.76] that breaks
[4307.76 → 4308.34] my heart
[4308.34 → 4308.68] and I'm
[4308.68 → 4308.74] going to
[4308.74 → 4309.16] repeat
[4309.16 → 4309.56] so you
[4309.56 → 4310.36] stand here
[4310.36 → 4310.82] in worship
[4310.82 → 4311.30] together
[4311.30 → 4311.94] is that
[4311.94 → 4313.32] some of you
[4313.32 → 4313.78] are just
[4313.78 → 4314.28] pretending
[4314.28 → 4318.08] and the truth
[4318.08 → 4318.52] that breaks
[4318.52 → 4319.12] my heart
[4319.12 → 4321.40] is that some
[4321.40 → 4321.90] of you have
[4321.90 → 4322.60] never even
[4322.60 → 4323.42] thought for one
[4323.42 → 4323.76] year
[4323.76 → 4325.78] is this
[4325.78 → 4326.06] really
[4326.06 → 4328.48] is this
[4328.48 → 4328.88] truth
[4328.88 → 4333.12] in some
[4333.12 → 4333.52] way
[4333.52 → 4335.32] we all
[4335.32 → 4335.80] know
[4335.80 → 4336.16] this
[4336.16 → 4336.68] longing
[4336.68 → 4337.54] of all
[4337.54 → 4338.92] and in
[4338.92 → 4339.22] some
[4339.22 → 4339.58] way
[4339.58 → 4340.58] our hearts
[4340.58 → 4341.78] are breaking
[4341.78 → 4342.68] in this
[4342.68 → 4343.30] manner
[4343.30 → 4344.02] and we
[4344.02 → 4345.34] can understand
[4345.34 → 4346.16] why Paul
[4346.16 → 4347.22] is crying
[4347.22 → 4347.60] out
[4347.60 → 4347.98] because
[4347.98 → 4349.18] day after
[4349.18 → 4349.50] day
[4349.50 → 4350.94] that is
[4350.94 → 4351.54] my prayer
[4351.54 → 4352.08] for
[4352.08 → 4352.52] the
[4352.52 → 4352.90] gathering
[4352.90 → 4353.42] him
[4353.42 → 4356.42] Paul's
[4356.42 → 4357.10] longing
[4357.10 → 4358.06] for his
[4358.06 → 4358.38] fellow
[4358.38 → 4358.94] Israelites
[4358.94 → 4360.86] intensifies
[4360.86 → 4362.08] as he
[4362.08 → 4362.78] lists
[4362.78 → 4363.56] the reasons
[4363.56 → 4364.32] why they
[4364.32 → 4365.02] really should
[4365.02 → 4365.84] know that
[4365.84 → 4366.14] that's what
[4366.14 → 4366.54] he does
[4366.54 → 4367.34] next
[4367.34 → 4368.68] right
[4368.68 → 4369.12] as he
[4369.12 → 4370.38] shows
[4370.38 → 4371.10] why they
[4371.10 → 4371.46] should
[4371.46 → 4371.92] have
[4371.92 → 4372.84] recognized
[4372.84 → 4373.56] Jesus
[4373.56 → 4374.74] notice
[4374.74 → 4375.12] in verse
[4375.12 → 4375.62] 4
[4375.62 → 4376.14] he says
[4376.14 → 4376.98] theirs
[4376.98 → 4377.76] is the
[4377.76 → 4378.30] adoption
[4378.30 → 4378.70] to
[4378.70 → 4379.20] son ship
[4379.20 → 4379.70] theirs
[4379.70 → 4380.26] is the
[4380.26 → 4380.70] divine
[4380.70 → 4381.46] glory
[4381.46 → 4381.76] the
[4381.76 → 4382.16] covenant
[4382.16 → 4382.58] the
[4382.58 → 4383.02] receiving
[4383.02 → 4383.24] of
[4383.24 → 4383.36] the
[4383.36 → 4383.68] law
[4383.68 → 4383.88] the
[4383.88 → 4384.14] temple
[4384.14 → 4384.52] worship
[4384.52 → 4384.82] and the
[4384.82 → 4385.20] promises
[4385.20 → 4386.14] theirs
[4386.14 → 4386.54] are the
[4386.54 → 4387.30] patriarchs
[4387.30 → 4387.76] and from
[4387.76 → 4388.08] them
[4388.08 → 4388.28] he
[4388.28 → 4388.56] raised
[4388.56 → 4388.76] the
[4388.76 → 4389.06] human
[4389.06 → 4389.68] ancestry
[4389.68 → 4390.48] of the
[4390.48 → 4390.92] Messiah
[4390.92 → 4393.12] and they
[4393.12 → 4393.28] have
[4393.28 → 4393.64] every
[4393.64 → 4394.40] opportunity
[4394.40 → 4395.44] to see
[4395.44 → 4396.14] and to
[4396.14 → 4396.58] know
[4396.58 → 4398.16] and in
[4398.16 → 4399.00] some way
[4399.00 → 4399.42] right
[4399.42 → 4399.74] again
[4399.74 → 4400.00] we'll come
[4400.00 → 4400.38] back to
[4400.38 → 4401.24] parents
[4401.24 → 4401.50] and
[4401.50 → 4402.86] Christian
[4402.86 → 4403.36] parents
[4403.36 → 4403.54] of
[4403.54 → 4404.08] children
[4404.08 → 4404.48] right
[4404.48 → 4405.54] this is
[4405.54 → 4405.76] our
[4405.76 → 4406.70] reality
[4406.70 → 4408.40] our
[4408.40 → 4408.62] kids
[4408.62 → 4408.70] our
[4408.70 → 4409.12] kids
[4409.12 → 4409.78] are
[4409.78 → 4409.84] baptized
[4409.84 → 4410.02] into
[4410.02 → 4410.22] a
[4410.22 → 4410.52] covenant
[4410.52 → 4411.06] community
[4411.06 → 4412.26] they're
[4412.26 → 4412.86] raised
[4412.86 → 4413.26] in
[4413.26 → 4413.60] the
[4413.60 → 4413.96] truths
[4413.96 → 4414.14] of
[4414.14 → 4414.26] the
[4414.26 → 4414.66] promises
[4414.66 → 4414.90] of
[4414.90 → 4415.02] the
[4415.02 → 4415.38] forgiveness
[4415.38 → 4415.68] of
[4415.68 → 4416.10] God
[4416.10 → 4416.60] that are
[4416.60 → 4416.84] coming
[4416.84 → 4417.46] by grace
[4417.46 → 4417.96] and faith
[4417.96 → 4418.24] and they
[4418.24 → 4418.80] are taught
[4418.80 → 4419.36] that over
[4419.36 → 4419.86] and over
[4419.86 → 4420.26] and over
[4420.26 → 4420.66] again
[4420.66 → 4421.10] from
[4421.10 → 4422.36] Jews and cadets
[4422.36 → 4422.84] to Sunday
[4422.84 → 4423.20] school
[4423.20 → 4423.70] to youth
[4423.70 → 4424.02] groups
[4424.02 → 4425.48] to gatherings
[4425.48 → 4426.60] in small groups
[4426.60 → 4427.26] and characters
[4427.26 → 4428.00] and the like
[4428.00 → 4428.82] they worship
[4428.82 → 4429.30] with us
[4429.30 → 4430.22] every week
[4430.22 → 4431.72] maybe they even
[4431.72 → 4432.50] come into your
[4432.50 → 4433.48] home and talk
[4433.48 → 4434.34] about life
[4434.34 → 4434.86] and faith
[4434.86 → 4435.52] with the
[4435.52 → 4435.84] baby
[4435.84 → 4436.46] they even
[4436.46 → 4436.80] go to
[4436.80 → 4437.32] kindergarten
[4437.32 → 4437.84] to
[4437.84 → 4438.70] grade 12
[4438.70 → 4438.94] to
[4438.94 → 4439.26] Christian
[4439.26 → 4439.72] school
[4439.72 → 4440.74] but now
[4440.74 → 4441.60] for whatever
[4441.60 → 4442.12] reason
[4442.12 → 4442.92] they're just
[4442.92 → 4443.74] not practicing
[4443.74 → 4444.36] the faith
[4444.36 → 4444.92] that they
[4444.92 → 4445.46] were raised
[4445.46 → 4445.74] in
[4445.74 → 4446.50] the faith
[4446.50 → 4446.90] of their
[4446.90 → 4447.28] youth
[4447.28 → 4448.48] not believing
[4448.48 → 4450.44] does that
[4450.44 → 4450.92] mean
[4450.92 → 4452.04] that the
[4452.04 → 4452.60] promises of
[4452.60 → 4452.98] baptism
[4452.98 → 4453.60] have failed
[4453.60 → 4455.92] right
[4455.92 → 4456.28] that's the
[4456.28 → 4456.76] question
[4456.76 → 4457.80] right
[4457.80 → 4458.50] to put it
[4458.50 → 4459.20] into our
[4459.20 → 4459.70] context
[4459.70 → 4460.76] that's the
[4460.76 → 4461.22] exact
[4461.22 → 4461.92] same
[4461.92 → 4462.70] question
[4462.70 → 4463.52] right
[4463.52 → 4464.20] since there
[4464.20 → 4464.82] are some
[4464.82 → 4465.22] who are
[4465.22 → 4466.14] clearly raised
[4466.14 → 4466.76] with every
[4466.76 → 4467.52] image of
[4467.52 → 4467.82] faith
[4467.82 → 4468.36] and a
[4468.36 → 4468.80] community
[4468.80 → 4469.46] you don't
[4469.46 → 4469.92] end up
[4469.92 → 4470.40] believing
[4470.40 → 4471.34] does that
[4471.34 → 4472.26] mean God
[4472.26 → 4473.90] has faith
[4473.90 → 4479.34] when we put it
[4479.34 → 4479.90] that way
[4479.90 → 4481.72] I trust you
[4481.72 → 4482.46] can see and
[4482.46 → 4483.06] share all
[4483.06 → 4483.64] anguish
[4483.64 → 4487.58] now you can
[4487.58 → 4488.08] see that this
[4488.08 → 4489.16] isn't dusty
[4489.16 → 4489.80] or dry
[4489.80 → 4490.40] theology
[4490.40 → 4491.82] right
[4491.82 → 4492.66] the answer
[4492.66 → 4493.08] to this
[4493.08 → 4493.68] question
[4493.68 → 4495.10] quite literally
[4495.10 → 4496.28] status is
[4496.28 → 4497.10] eternity
[4497.10 → 4500.72] the answer
[4500.72 → 4501.04] to this
[4501.04 → 4501.40] question
[4501.40 → 4501.98] comes
[4501.98 → 4503.24] to Paul
[4503.24 → 4504.00] in the
[4504.00 → 4505.16] focus of
[4505.16 → 4506.20] God's
[4506.20 → 4506.88] sovereignty
[4506.88 → 4509.44] back in
[4509.44 → 4509.98] Romans 8
[4509.98 → 4510.60] 28
[4510.60 → 4512.04] we look at
[4512.04 → 4512.56] God's
[4512.56 → 4513.06] sovereignty
[4513.06 → 4513.76] in the
[4513.76 → 4514.06] world
[4514.06 → 4515.36] you can read
[4515.36 → 4515.62] there
[4515.62 → 4517.04] and we
[4517.04 → 4517.76] know that
[4517.76 → 4518.26] in all
[4518.26 → 4518.66] things
[4518.66 → 4519.50] God works
[4519.50 → 4520.64] for those
[4520.64 → 4521.14] who love
[4521.14 → 4521.38] him
[4521.38 → 4521.86] who have
[4521.86 → 4522.44] been called
[4522.44 → 4523.14] for him
[4523.14 → 4523.94] to his
[4523.94 → 4524.36] purpose
[4524.36 → 4525.70] and then
[4525.70 → 4526.24] we saw
[4526.24 → 4526.96] this order
[4526.96 → 4527.66] work itself
[4527.66 → 4527.88] out
[4527.88 → 4528.30] we saw
[4528.30 → 4529.22] this activity
[4529.22 → 4529.88] of God's
[4529.88 → 4530.30] sovereignty
[4530.30 → 4531.24] those he
[4531.24 → 4531.82] predestined
[4531.82 → 4532.30] he also
[4532.30 → 4532.74] called
[4532.74 → 4533.26] those he
[4533.26 → 4533.56] called
[4533.56 → 4534.08] he also
[4534.08 → 4535.00] justified
[4535.00 → 4535.58] those he
[4535.58 → 4536.12] justified
[4536.12 → 4536.92] he also
[4536.92 → 4538.12] glorified
[4538.12 → 4539.56] sovereignty
[4539.56 → 4540.90] is the
[4540.90 → 4541.60] exercise
[4541.60 → 4542.58] of God's
[4542.58 → 4543.24] reign in
[4543.24 → 4543.80] the world
[4543.80 → 4545.28] God is
[4545.28 → 4545.78] who he
[4545.78 → 4546.22] is
[4546.22 → 4547.00] and so
[4547.00 → 4547.86] therefore
[4547.86 → 4549.00] must be
[4549.00 → 4549.60] sovereign
[4549.60 → 4551.10] let me say
[4551.10 → 4551.44] that again
[4551.44 → 4552.04] if God
[4552.04 → 4552.56] is not
[4552.56 → 4553.18] sovereign
[4553.18 → 4554.14] if he's
[4554.14 → 4555.14] not exercising
[4555.14 → 4555.84] his reign
[4555.84 → 4556.16] in the
[4556.16 → 4556.44] world
[4556.44 → 4557.24] he's not
[4557.24 → 4557.72] God
[4557.72 → 4560.30] and then
[4560.30 → 4561.14] the scope
[4561.14 → 4562.22] of God's
[4562.22 → 4562.98] action in
[4562.98 → 4563.42] the world
[4563.42 → 4564.02] is both
[4564.02 → 4564.58] cosmic
[4564.58 → 4565.38] and
[4565.38 → 4566.02] microscopic
[4566.02 → 4567.74] the scope
[4567.74 → 4568.30] of God's
[4568.30 → 4568.68] sovereign
[4568.68 → 4569.42] action in
[4569.42 → 4569.76] the world
[4569.76 → 4570.24] is both
[4570.24 → 4571.24] the major
[4571.24 → 4572.02] machinations
[4572.02 → 4573.06] of planets
[4573.06 → 4574.10] and the
[4574.10 → 4574.62] small
[4574.62 → 4575.28] movements
[4575.28 → 4576.04] of planets
[4576.04 → 4578.36] and that
[4578.36 → 4578.72] meaning
[4578.72 → 4581.52] is also
[4581.52 → 4582.68] in the
[4582.68 → 4583.12] hearts
[4583.12 → 4584.10] of many
[4584.10 → 4585.14] women
[4585.14 → 4587.58] part of
[4587.58 → 4588.04] this first
[4588.04 → 4588.56] two chapters
[4588.56 → 4590.14] that grounded
[4590.14 → 4590.68] us here
[4590.68 → 4591.32] and has
[4591.32 → 4591.80] caused us
[4591.80 → 4592.28] to come to
[4592.28 → 4592.72] this place
[4592.72 → 4593.08] with this
[4593.08 → 4593.52] particular
[4593.52 → 4594.08] question
[4594.08 → 4594.88] helps us
[4594.88 → 4595.32] to see
[4595.32 → 4596.20] that apart
[4596.20 → 4597.08] from God
[4597.08 → 4598.24] first choosing
[4598.24 → 4598.88] us
[4598.88 → 4600.54] we stay
[4600.54 → 4601.52] dead in
[4601.52 → 4602.78] our sins
[4602.78 → 4603.70] being
[4603.70 → 4604.30] dead in
[4604.30 → 4604.94] our sins
[4604.94 → 4605.90] means we
[4605.90 → 4606.68] can't do
[4606.68 → 4607.40] anything
[4607.40 → 4608.88] I don't
[4608.88 → 4609.26] know if
[4609.26 → 4609.58] you've ever
[4609.58 → 4610.36] seen a
[4610.36 → 4610.90] dead body
[4610.90 → 4612.26] but they
[4612.26 → 4612.58] don't do
[4612.58 → 4613.06] anything
[4613.06 → 4614.56] I'm not
[4614.56 → 4614.86] trying to
[4614.86 → 4615.16] crash
[4615.16 → 4615.54] I don't
[4615.54 → 4616.30] oversimplify
[4616.30 → 4616.66] it but
[4616.66 → 4617.62] the reality
[4617.62 → 4618.98] is if
[4618.98 → 4619.52] we are
[4619.52 → 4619.88] dead
[4619.88 → 4620.30] there's
[4620.30 → 4620.64] nothing
[4620.64 → 4621.08] we can
[4621.08 → 4621.32] do
[4621.32 → 4621.72] and the
[4621.72 → 4622.04] same
[4622.04 → 4622.90] is true
[4622.90 → 4624.18] spiritually
[4624.18 → 4626.12] in the
[4626.12 → 4626.78] deathliness
[4626.78 → 4627.66] of our
[4627.66 → 4628.30] sin
[4628.30 → 4629.10] we are
[4629.10 → 4629.72] unable
[4629.72 → 4630.40] to choose
[4630.40 → 4631.16] God
[4631.16 → 4631.84] we cannot
[4631.84 → 4632.26] raise
[4632.26 → 4632.88] ourselves
[4632.88 → 4633.56] to new
[4633.56 → 4633.94] life
[4633.94 → 4634.76] we need
[4634.76 → 4635.18] to be
[4635.18 → 4635.82] raised
[4635.82 → 4636.60] to new
[4636.60 → 4637.02] life
[4637.02 → 4638.46] or to
[4638.46 → 4638.80] use
[4638.80 → 4639.16] the
[4639.16 → 4639.74] Old Testament
[4639.74 → 4640.26] tradition
[4640.26 → 4642.58] before the
[4642.58 → 4643.00] work of the
[4643.00 → 4643.64] Holy Spirit
[4643.64 → 4644.70] our hearts
[4644.70 → 4645.44] are stoned
[4645.44 → 4647.28] and the
[4647.28 → 4647.92] only way
[4647.92 → 4648.32] to get a
[4648.32 → 4649.22] heart flesh
[4649.22 → 4650.16] is for that
[4650.16 → 4650.92] Holy Spirit
[4650.92 → 4652.00] to breathe
[4652.00 → 4652.64] life
[4652.64 → 4654.08] into you
[4654.08 → 4655.44] in the
[4655.44 → 4655.80] beginning
[4655.80 → 4656.66] God
[4656.66 → 4657.30] breathes
[4657.30 → 4657.68] life
[4657.68 → 4658.08] into
[4658.08 → 4658.44] Adam
[4658.44 → 4659.02] and Eve
[4659.02 → 4659.60] our first
[4659.60 → 4659.98] parents
[4659.98 → 4660.26] and when
[4660.26 → 4660.44] they
[4660.44 → 4660.82] fell
[4660.82 → 4661.62] against
[4661.62 → 4662.20] God
[4662.20 → 4663.12] they
[4663.12 → 4663.50] fell
[4663.50 → 4663.86] into
[4663.86 → 4664.26] sin
[4664.26 → 4664.68] and all
[4664.68 → 4665.16] humanity
[4665.16 → 4665.60] with them
[4665.60 → 4666.12] has fallen
[4666.12 → 4666.76] now into
[4666.76 → 4667.06] the
[4667.06 → 4667.62] deathliness
[4667.62 → 4668.92] of sin
[4668.92 → 4669.64] and so
[4669.64 → 4670.22] in our
[4670.22 → 4671.28] new beginnings
[4671.28 → 4671.98] our new
[4671.98 → 4672.32] birth
[4672.32 → 4672.78] he
[4672.78 → 4673.20] breathes
[4673.20 → 4673.74] to breathe
[4673.74 → 4674.16] life
[4674.16 → 4674.86] into us
[4674.86 → 4675.50] afresh
[4675.50 → 4677.56] and sometimes
[4677.56 → 4678.16] that happens
[4678.16 → 4678.78] in a moment
[4678.78 → 4679.86] right
[4679.86 → 4680.58] sometimes
[4680.58 → 4681.50] maybe this
[4681.50 → 4681.82] is your
[4681.82 → 4682.38] testimony
[4682.38 → 4683.28] you wake
[4683.28 → 4683.80] up from
[4683.80 → 4684.36] a slumber
[4684.36 → 4685.12] of deathliness
[4685.12 → 4685.68] and sin
[4685.68 → 4686.02] with an
[4686.02 → 4686.66] immediacy
[4686.66 → 4687.48] and a
[4687.48 → 4687.86] newness
[4687.86 → 4688.34] of life
[4688.34 → 4688.86] and you
[4688.86 → 4690.30] are amazing
[4690.30 → 4690.78] and your
[4690.78 → 4691.38] testimony
[4691.38 → 4692.22] and life
[4692.22 → 4692.90] transformed
[4692.90 → 4694.18] is amazing
[4694.18 → 4695.42] and obvious
[4695.42 → 4696.26] and drastic
[4696.26 → 4697.58] and so clear
[4697.58 → 4698.02] for everyone
[4698.02 → 4698.46] to see
[4698.46 → 4700.34] and sometimes
[4700.34 → 4701.38] in fact
[4701.38 → 4702.68] more often
[4702.68 → 4703.64] than the
[4703.64 → 4704.04] other day
[4704.04 → 4705.96] sometimes
[4705.96 → 4707.24] that waking
[4707.24 → 4707.52] up
[4707.52 → 4708.04] that new
[4708.04 → 4708.64] and new
[4708.64 → 4708.96] life
[4708.96 → 4709.74] happens over
[4709.74 → 4710.18] the course
[4710.18 → 4710.66] of a period
[4710.66 → 4711.28] of time
[4711.28 → 4711.78] right
[4711.78 → 4712.66] whether it's
[4712.66 → 4714.04] just a
[4714.04 → 4714.38] moment
[4714.38 → 4714.90] or a
[4714.90 → 4715.26] process
[4715.26 → 4715.90] that takes
[4715.90 → 4716.60] 20 or
[4716.60 → 4717.54] 25 or
[4717.54 → 4718.12] 30 or
[4718.12 → 4719.04] 40 years
[4719.04 → 4719.50] right
[4719.50 → 4720.18] whether it's
[4720.18 → 4720.54] a need
[4720.54 → 4721.20] or it
[4721.20 → 4721.64] takes a
[4721.64 → 4721.98] lifetime
[4721.98 → 4723.22] it's still
[4723.22 → 4724.02] a miracle
[4724.02 → 4724.96] of God
[4724.96 → 4725.76] transforming
[4725.76 → 4726.66] us into
[4726.66 → 4727.36] newness
[4727.36 → 4728.36] of life
[4728.36 → 4729.62] he
[4729.62 → 4730.38] must
[4730.38 → 4731.48] do it
[4731.48 → 4733.32] and so
[4733.32 → 4734.02] right
[4734.02 → 4735.24] Paul is
[4735.24 → 4735.72] on this
[4735.72 → 4736.14] journey
[4736.14 → 4736.44] of
[4736.44 → 4737.16] exposition
[4737.16 → 4737.66] revealing
[4737.66 → 4738.20] to us
[4738.20 → 4738.76] just
[4738.76 → 4739.24] exactly
[4739.24 → 4739.72] who God
[4739.72 → 4740.02] is
[4740.02 → 4740.30] and what
[4740.30 → 4740.52] he's
[4740.52 → 4741.08] doing
[4741.08 → 4741.48] and how
[4741.48 → 4741.80] he has
[4741.80 → 4742.86] done it
[4742.86 → 4743.82] he's
[4743.82 → 4744.42] anticipating
[4744.42 → 4745.22] the question
[4745.22 → 4746.30] of Israel
[4746.30 → 4747.18] not the
[4747.18 → 4747.46] human
[4747.46 → 4748.22] in the
[4748.22 → 4748.64] Messiah
[4748.64 → 4749.14] even though
[4749.14 → 4749.60] they had
[4749.60 → 4750.56] all the
[4750.56 → 4751.34] advantages
[4751.34 → 4753.52] right
[4753.52 → 4753.74] he's
[4753.74 → 4754.28] anticipating
[4754.28 → 4754.90] the question
[4754.90 → 4755.32] that we
[4755.32 → 4755.60] have
[4755.60 → 4757.36] didn't I
[4757.36 → 4757.58] do
[4757.58 → 4758.10] everything
[4758.10 → 4758.88] in the
[4758.88 → 4758.90] time
[4758.90 → 4760.00] why
[4760.00 → 4760.22] do
[4760.22 → 4760.50] they
[4760.50 → 4760.82] believe
[4760.82 → 4763.22] he's
[4763.22 → 4763.82] anticipating
[4763.82 → 4765.32] the response
[4765.32 → 4766.22] to the
[4766.22 → 4766.58] anguish
[4766.58 → 4766.82] of our
[4766.82 → 4767.20] hearts
[4767.20 → 4767.98] God
[4767.98 → 4768.54] he
[4768.54 → 4769.06] claims
[4769.06 → 4770.72] he
[4770.72 → 4771.42] clarifies
[4771.42 → 4771.64] he
[4771.64 → 4772.88] says
[4772.88 → 4774.98] for not
[4774.98 → 4775.72] all who
[4775.72 → 4775.88] are
[4775.88 → 4776.34] descended
[4776.34 → 4776.78] from
[4776.78 → 4777.32] Israel
[4777.32 → 4777.78] are
[4777.78 → 4778.26] Israel
[4778.26 → 4779.18] nor
[4779.18 → 4779.62] because
[4779.62 → 4779.82] they
[4779.82 → 4779.96] are
[4779.96 → 4780.14] his
[4780.14 → 4780.52] descendants
[4780.52 → 4780.92] are they
[4780.92 → 4781.10] all
[4781.10 → 4781.64] Abraham's
[4781.64 → 4781.98] children
[4781.98 → 4783.06] it
[4783.06 → 4787.10] is not
[4787.10 → 4787.30] the
[4787.30 → 4787.68] children
[4787.68 → 4788.00] who are
[4788.00 → 4788.54] physical
[4788.54 → 4789.00] descent
[4789.00 → 4789.40] to our
[4789.40 → 4789.72] God's
[4789.72 → 4790.02] children
[4790.02 → 4790.78] but it
[4790.78 → 4791.08] is the
[4791.08 → 4791.48] children
[4791.48 → 4792.16] from
[4792.16 → 4792.66] who are
[4792.66 → 4792.78] the
[4792.78 → 4793.06] garden
[4793.06 → 4793.40] of
[4793.40 → 4793.78] Abraham
[4793.78 → 4794.82] also
[4794.82 → 4797.42] remember
[4797.42 → 4798.94] or here
[4798.94 → 4800.20] Abraham
[4800.20 → 4800.96] had two
[4800.96 → 4801.32] sons
[4801.32 → 4802.52] Isaac
[4802.52 → 4803.84] and Ishmael
[4803.84 → 4804.60] Isaac
[4804.60 → 4805.14] born to
[4805.14 → 4805.42] Sarah
[4805.42 → 4806.26] and Ishmael
[4806.26 → 4806.74] born to
[4806.74 → 4807.10] Hagar
[4807.10 → 4808.44] the promise
[4808.44 → 4809.12] is offered
[4809.12 → 4810.40] to Isaac
[4810.40 → 4811.22] and not
[4811.22 → 4811.84] to Ishmael
[4811.84 → 4813.46] the whole
[4813.46 → 4813.86] point is
[4813.86 → 4814.72] just because
[4814.72 → 4815.14] you are
[4815.14 → 4816.16] a descendant
[4816.16 → 4817.00] of Abraham
[4817.00 → 4818.12] does not
[4818.12 → 4818.88] mean you
[4818.88 → 4820.18] receive the
[4820.18 → 4820.70] promise
[4820.70 → 4821.40] in him
[4821.40 → 4822.30] it's not
[4822.30 → 4822.94] automatic
[4822.94 → 4823.34] at least
[4823.34 → 4823.74] it's not
[4823.74 → 4824.26] automatic
[4824.26 → 4824.80] by virtue
[4824.80 → 4825.32] of birth
[4825.32 → 4827.52] he makes
[4827.52 → 4827.98] the same
[4827.98 → 4828.96] point again
[4828.96 → 4829.36] he uses
[4829.36 → 4829.66] another
[4829.66 → 4830.32] example
[4830.32 → 4832.18] of Isaac
[4832.18 → 4832.62] and
[4832.62 → 4833.04] Rebecca
[4833.04 → 4834.20] children
[4834.20 → 4835.96] here
[4835.96 → 4836.86] it's even
[4836.86 → 4837.16] more
[4837.16 → 4837.88] difficult
[4837.88 → 4838.28] notice
[4838.28 → 4839.68] verse 11
[4839.68 → 4841.38] God's
[4841.38 → 4842.12] choice
[4842.12 → 4843.42] to bless
[4843.42 → 4844.20] Jacob
[4844.20 → 4845.16] and not
[4845.16 → 4845.88] Esau
[4845.88 → 4847.20] was made
[4847.20 → 4848.42] before
[4848.42 → 4848.68] the
[4848.68 → 4848.96] sons
[4848.96 → 4849.50] were born
[4849.50 → 4851.54] it was
[4851.54 → 4852.06] made
[4852.06 → 4852.66] before
[4852.66 → 4853.08] they had
[4853.08 → 4853.30] done
[4853.30 → 4853.88] anything
[4853.88 → 4854.46] good
[4854.46 → 4855.92] or bad
[4855.92 → 4858.24] in fact
[4858.24 → 4858.68] it was
[4858.68 → 4859.30] made
[4859.30 → 4860.30] not even
[4860.30 → 4861.02] from the
[4861.02 → 4862.00] mind of
[4862.00 → 4862.24] God
[4862.24 → 4862.54] that said
[4862.54 → 4862.94] I knew
[4862.94 → 4863.46] what choice
[4863.46 → 4863.74] they would
[4863.74 → 4864.26] have made
[4864.26 → 4864.80] good or
[4864.80 → 4865.08] bad
[4865.08 → 4866.64] instead
[4866.64 → 4868.16] it happened
[4868.16 → 4869.64] in order
[4869.64 → 4870.50] that God's
[4870.50 → 4870.82] purpose
[4870.82 → 4871.34] and election
[4871.34 → 4872.30] might stand
[4872.30 → 4872.98] and that he
[4872.98 → 4873.54] lists that
[4873.54 → 4874.02] purpose
[4874.02 → 4875.26] that it's
[4875.26 → 4876.04] not by
[4876.04 → 4876.68] worse
[4876.68 → 4877.86] but by
[4877.86 → 4878.30] him
[4878.30 → 4878.80] who
[4878.80 → 4879.38] calls
[4879.38 → 4880.78] that is
[4880.78 → 4881.30] to say
[4881.30 → 4882.96] not
[4882.96 → 4883.36] a team
[4883.36 → 4885.70] it's God's
[4885.70 → 4886.00] sovereign
[4886.00 → 4886.42] choice
[4886.42 → 4890.20] no
[4890.20 → 4892.54] if you
[4892.54 → 4892.64] were
[4892.64 → 4892.96] tracking
[4892.96 → 4893.28] with
[4893.28 → 4895.02] and you
[4895.02 → 4895.70] hear that
[4895.70 → 4897.20] I know
[4897.20 → 4897.66] there is
[4897.66 → 4898.26] temptation
[4898.26 → 4899.06] to say
[4899.06 → 4900.24] how is
[4900.24 → 4900.66] that
[4900.66 → 4901.18] fair
[4901.18 → 4902.54] that's
[4902.54 → 4902.78] not
[4902.78 → 4903.22] fair
[4903.22 → 4904.78] and you
[4904.78 → 4905.04] know what
[4905.04 → 4905.28] we're going
[4905.28 → 4905.56] to have
[4905.56 → 4906.00] the cabinet
[4906.00 → 4906.38] for that
[4906.38 → 4912.42] but for
[4912.42 → 4912.66] real
[4912.66 → 4914.88] this is
[4914.88 → 4915.34] hard

[4918.00 → 4918.90] in his
[4918.90 → 4919.68] commentary
[4919.68 → 4920.00] on the
[4920.00 → 4920.26] text
[4920.26 → 4920.50] says
[4920.50 → 4920.76] this
[4920.76 → 4922.26] teaching
[4922.26 → 4922.80] is easy
[4922.80 → 4923.66] to understand
[4923.66 → 4925.06] but not
[4925.06 → 4925.34] easy
[4925.34 → 4925.98] to accept
[4925.98 → 4929.04] how
[4929.04 → 4929.60] do you
[4929.60 → 4930.28] make it
[4930.28 → 4930.98] make sense
[4930.98 → 4933.88] it's hard
[4933.88 → 4935.34] in our hearts
[4935.34 → 4937.64] it's hard in our hearts
[4937.64 → 4939.26] because
[4939.26 → 4940.46] theology
[4940.46 → 4941.26] isn't
[4941.26 → 4941.90] divorced
[4941.90 → 4943.06] from the people
[4943.06 → 4944.10] in our lives
[4944.10 → 4948.68] our hearts
[4948.68 → 4949.30] broke in
[4949.30 → 4949.62] and I'm
[4949.62 → 4949.88] giving
[4949.88 → 4950.28] our
[4950.28 → 4950.76] truth
[4950.76 → 4952.92] because of
[4952.92 → 4953.36] our sons
[4953.36 → 4953.82] and our
[4953.82 → 4955.86] friends
[4955.86 → 4957.04] and our
[4957.04 → 4957.28] friends
[4957.28 → 4957.78] and our
[4957.78 → 4957.90] friends
[4957.90 → 4958.50] and our
[4958.50 → 4958.78] friends
[4958.78 → 4966.00] and I'm not
[4966.00 → 4966.38] sure
[4966.38 → 4968.78] that at this
[4968.78 → 4969.48] point I want
[4969.48 → 4969.72] you to
[4969.72 → 4970.62] alleviate that
[4970.62 → 4974.42] probably
[4974.42 → 4975.00] some
[4975.00 → 4976.38] maturing
[4976.38 → 4976.80] wisdom
[4976.80 → 4977.46] in the city
[4977.46 → 4978.12] in the back
[4978.12 → 4979.38] for a moment
[4979.38 → 4981.88] but
[4981.88 → 4983.24] as we
[4983.24 → 4983.78] include our
[4983.78 → 4984.34] time together
[4984.34 → 4984.88] let me
[4984.88 → 4986.00] anticipate
[4986.00 → 4986.72] some of your
[4986.72 → 4987.28] questions
[4987.28 → 4988.60] and then
[4988.60 → 4989.08] invite you
[4989.08 → 4989.40] to the
[4989.40 → 4989.72] conversation
[4989.72 → 4991.36] so one
[4991.36 → 4992.26] first question
[4992.26 → 4993.22] does this
[4993.22 → 4993.88] mean God
[4993.88 → 4994.20] is our
[4994.20 → 4994.52] church
[4994.52 → 4995.76] does this
[4995.76 → 4996.40] mean God
[4996.40 → 4996.90] essentially
[4996.90 → 4997.70] chooses by
[4997.70 → 4998.24] flipping a
[4998.24 → 4998.90] coin or by
[4998.90 → 4999.50] going eat
[4999.50 → 5000.36] me money
[5000.36 → 5000.94] bone
[5000.94 → 5004.58] absolutely
[5004.58 → 5005.70] not
[5005.70 → 5006.76] right
[5006.76 → 5007.66] Paul is
[5007.66 → 5008.66] not saying
[5008.66 → 5009.30] that God
[5009.30 → 5010.24] has no
[5010.24 → 5011.22] reasons
[5011.22 → 5013.14] all we are
[5013.14 → 5013.78] being told
[5013.78 → 5014.56] is that God's
[5014.56 → 5015.18] reasons are
[5015.18 → 5016.10] not in us
[5016.10 → 5019.24] right
[5019.24 → 5019.82] the reasons
[5019.82 → 5020.48] are not based
[5020.48 → 5021.20] on you
[5021.20 → 5023.24] God's
[5023.24 → 5024.02] reason for
[5024.02 → 5024.68] choosing is
[5024.68 → 5025.58] based on him
[5025.58 → 5026.56] and his
[5026.56 → 5027.32] glory
[5027.32 → 5033.86] you may
[5033.86 → 5034.26] not
[5034.26 → 5035.68] ever
[5035.68 → 5036.74] know
[5036.74 → 5038.80] but he
[5038.80 → 5039.22] has
[5039.22 → 5040.36] to know
[5040.36 → 5040.78] that
[5040.78 → 5041.38] with
[5041.38 → 5042.32] certainty
[5042.32 → 5043.56] and because
[5043.56 → 5044.26] God is
[5044.26 → 5044.90] who he is
[5044.90 → 5045.54] because God
[5045.54 → 5045.98] is good
[5045.98 → 5046.86] his reasons
[5046.86 → 5048.00] are always
[5048.00 → 5048.86] good
[5048.86 → 5050.14] and not just
[5050.14 → 5050.72] good in the
[5050.72 → 5051.20] way that we
[5051.20 → 5051.86] use that term
[5051.86 → 5052.40] globally
[5052.40 → 5054.00] but maximally
[5054.00 → 5054.68] good
[5054.68 → 5056.04] the best
[5056.04 → 5056.56] of all
[5056.56 → 5057.06] goods
[5057.06 → 5058.06] the greatest
[5058.06 → 5058.72] good
[5058.72 → 5060.92] always
[5060.92 → 5064.42] second
[5064.42 → 5065.82] you might
[5065.82 → 5066.40] come to me
[5066.40 → 5066.78] and be like
[5066.78 → 5067.22] oh man
[5067.22 → 5068.02] that is way
[5068.02 → 5069.10] too hard
[5069.10 → 5070.14] do I really
[5070.14 → 5070.92] have to believe
[5070.92 → 5071.30] this
[5071.30 → 5072.48] can't I just
[5072.48 → 5073.02] go and do
[5073.02 → 5073.62] my best
[5073.62 → 5076.26] yes of course
[5076.26 → 5077.58] we want you
[5077.58 → 5078.14] to go and
[5078.14 → 5078.84] do your best
[5078.84 → 5081.10] but the
[5081.10 → 5081.48] truth
[5081.48 → 5082.28] of the
[5082.28 → 5082.76] lot
[5082.76 → 5083.60] from beginning
[5083.60 → 5084.08] to end
[5084.08 → 5084.90] is that your
[5084.90 → 5085.74] best isn't
[5085.74 → 5086.26] going to be
[5086.26 → 5086.84] good enough
[5086.84 → 5089.40] and so
[5089.40 → 5089.76] yeah
[5089.76 → 5090.50] the reality
[5090.50 → 5091.12] is if you
[5091.12 → 5091.94] want salvation
[5091.94 → 5093.08] to be possible
[5093.08 → 5094.50] for anyone
[5094.50 → 5096.58] you have to
[5096.58 → 5097.28] believe in this
[5097.28 → 5097.68] truth
[5097.68 → 5098.32] in the
[5098.32 → 5098.62] doctrine
[5098.62 → 5099.86] of election
[5099.86 → 5102.98] then
[5102.98 → 5104.30] the comfort
[5104.30 → 5104.82] of this
[5104.82 → 5105.06] truth
[5105.06 → 5105.60] don't miss
[5105.60 → 5106.12] the comfort
[5106.12 → 5107.12] of this
[5107.12 → 5107.42] truth
[5107.42 → 5108.00] right
[5108.00 → 5108.44] because the
[5108.44 → 5109.00] reality is
[5109.00 → 5109.84] if I
[5109.84 → 5110.66] can't do
[5110.66 → 5111.34] anything
[5111.34 → 5112.00] to gain
[5112.00 → 5112.28] it
[5112.28 → 5113.28] then I
[5113.28 → 5113.52] can't
[5113.52 → 5113.76] believe
[5113.76 → 5113.92] you
[5113.92 → 5114.30] lose
[5114.30 → 5114.54] it
[5114.54 → 5116.30] right
[5116.30 → 5116.72] if it
[5116.72 → 5117.48] is true
[5117.48 → 5118.36] because God
[5118.36 → 5119.24] has declared
[5119.24 → 5120.18] you his
[5120.18 → 5120.96] own
[5120.96 → 5121.94] then you
[5121.94 → 5122.52] cannot
[5122.52 → 5123.74] lose that
[5123.74 → 5124.50] because God
[5124.50 → 5125.12] cannot be
[5125.12 → 5125.42] wrong
[5125.42 → 5127.28] it would be
[5127.28 → 5127.86] against his
[5127.86 → 5128.32] character
[5128.32 → 5129.22] so the
[5129.22 → 5129.94] security
[5129.94 → 5130.80] of our
[5130.80 → 5131.50] salvation
[5131.50 → 5132.28] isn't how
[5132.28 → 5133.04] good I am
[5133.04 → 5133.84] or how hard
[5133.84 → 5134.54] I believe
[5134.54 → 5135.42] or even how
[5135.42 → 5136.22] humble I am
[5136.22 → 5136.66] in admitting
[5136.66 → 5137.14] that I don't
[5137.14 → 5137.92] understand it
[5137.92 → 5139.06] the security
[5139.06 → 5139.52] of your
[5139.52 → 5140.02] salvation
[5140.02 → 5140.70] is the
[5140.70 → 5141.26] character
[5141.26 → 5142.02] of God
[5142.02 → 5142.58] himself
[5142.58 → 5144.40] there is
[5144.40 → 5144.76] no more
[5144.76 → 5145.18] secure
[5145.18 → 5146.06] truth
[5146.06 → 5148.94] now
[5148.94 → 5150.80] the doctrine
[5150.80 → 5151.24] of
[5151.24 → 5152.16] sovereignty
[5152.16 → 5153.34] and election
[5153.34 → 5154.36] means that
[5154.36 → 5155.10] he gives
[5155.10 → 5156.32] you everything
[5156.32 → 5159.82] the flip side
[5159.82 → 5160.16] of that
[5160.16 → 5161.04] also of course
[5161.04 → 5161.48] means that
[5161.48 → 5162.28] he can ask
[5162.28 → 5163.24] of you
[5163.24 → 5164.02] anything
[5164.02 → 5166.58] he can give
[5166.58 → 5167.14] you everything
[5167.14 → 5169.28] so there is
[5169.28 → 5169.90] nothing that
[5169.90 → 5170.32] you can't
[5170.32 → 5170.60] ask
[5170.60 → 5174.02] so even
[5174.02 → 5175.28] as simple
[5175.28 → 5176.38] as when that
[5176.38 → 5177.10] offering plate
[5177.10 → 5177.68] comes by
[5177.68 → 5177.98] and the
[5177.98 → 5178.18] deacon
[5178.18 → 5178.72] goes up
[5178.72 → 5178.96] and you
[5178.96 → 5179.34] go oh
[5179.34 → 5179.76] this is my
[5179.76 → 5180.20] time to
[5180.20 → 5180.74] come out
[5180.74 → 5182.38] this is my
[5182.38 → 5182.96] time to
[5182.96 → 5183.58] check my
[5183.58 → 5183.94] phone
[5183.94 → 5185.54] maybe
[5185.54 → 5186.46] maybe
[5186.46 → 5187.60] God is
[5187.60 → 5187.86] asking
[5187.86 → 5188.28] something
[5188.28 → 5190.88] even as
[5190.88 → 5191.28] we stand
[5191.28 → 5191.68] up here
[5191.68 → 5192.40] and look
[5192.40 → 5193.06] to volunteers
[5193.06 → 5193.54] to round
[5193.54 → 5194.10] out the
[5194.10 → 5194.48] needs that
[5194.48 → 5194.80] we have
[5194.80 → 5195.38] in our
[5195.38 → 5195.74] church
[5195.74 → 5196.24] family
[5196.24 → 5197.06] maybe
[5197.06 → 5197.70] God is
[5197.70 → 5199.00] asking
[5199.00 → 5199.38] something
[5199.38 → 5200.06] to do
[5200.06 → 5202.62] he's
[5202.62 → 5203.06] given you
[5203.06 → 5203.60] everything
[5203.60 → 5204.16] there is
[5204.16 → 5204.66] nothing
[5204.66 → 5205.34] he can't
[5205.34 → 5205.60] ask
[5205.60 → 5206.00] you to do
[5206.00 → 5207.66] and then
[5207.66 → 5208.26] lastly here
[5208.26 → 5208.76] he's done
[5208.76 → 5209.24] it all
[5209.24 → 5210.28] there is
[5210.28 → 5210.60] nothing
[5210.60 → 5211.00] that he
[5211.00 → 5211.24] can't
[5211.24 → 5211.42] ask
[5211.42 → 5211.64] you to
[5211.64 → 5211.90] do
[5211.90 → 5213.06] and maybe
[5213.06 → 5213.38] that's
[5213.38 → 5213.58] going to
[5213.58 → 5214.08] look like
[5214.08 → 5214.50] going to
[5214.50 → 5214.92] Nepal
[5214.92 → 5215.84] as a
[5215.84 → 5216.34] missionary
[5216.34 → 5218.44] maybe that's
[5218.44 → 5218.64] going to
[5218.64 → 5219.14] look like
[5219.14 → 5219.52] having the
[5219.52 → 5219.70] hard
[5219.70 → 5220.22] conversation
[5220.22 → 5220.94] with friends
[5220.94 → 5221.38] that we
[5221.38 → 5221.76] offer
[5221.76 → 5222.56] difficult
[5222.56 → 5223.18] maybe that's
[5223.18 → 5223.40] going to
[5223.40 → 5224.00] look like
[5224.00 → 5224.86] getting up
[5224.86 → 5225.32] an hour
[5225.32 → 5225.80] earlier
[5225.80 → 5226.50] every day
[5226.50 → 5227.16] just to
[5227.16 → 5227.72] spend it
[5227.72 → 5228.28] in prayer
[5228.28 → 5229.04] for your
[5229.04 → 5229.42] case
[5229.42 → 5231.36] if he's
[5231.36 → 5231.64] done it
[5231.64 → 5231.88] all
[5231.88 → 5232.20] there is
[5232.20 → 5232.50] nothing
[5232.50 → 5233.12] he can't
[5233.12 → 5233.84] ask us
[5233.84 → 5234.50] to do
[5234.50 → 5235.64] in prayer
[5235.64 → 5237.36] and then
[5237.36 → 5240.20] finally
[5240.20 → 5242.18] remember
[5242.18 → 5243.74] the goal
[5243.74 → 5244.36] of all
[5244.36 → 5245.02] of this
[5245.02 → 5246.36] is to
[5246.36 → 5246.92] end
[5246.92 → 5247.82] in
[5247.82 → 5248.64] prayer
[5248.64 → 5250.56] and so
[5250.56 → 5251.50] even if
[5251.50 → 5252.34] or when
[5252.34 → 5253.32] we can't
[5253.32 → 5254.32] fully understand
