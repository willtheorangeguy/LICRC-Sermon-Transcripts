• Paul is writing a letter to the church in Rome around AD 57, during his third missionary journey
• The spiritual gift that will make the church strong is the gospel of God
• Paul identifies himself as a "bond servant" or slave of Jesus Christ, emphasizing his commitment and authority to serve God's message
• Paul wants to give the Christians in Rome a gift that will make them strong, which is the gospel of God
• The title "bond servant" is significant because it implies that Paul gives himself completely to serving Jesus Christ
• The importance of the gospel as the truth about Jesus Christ that makes one strong
• Misconceptions about the role of the gospel in Christianity (e.g., it's just a way to get saved, and then you move on)
• Paul's emphasis on the gospel being what makes one strong, not just a means of getting saved
• The connection between faith and obedience, and how faith is not just feeling or conviction but living out the gospel
• The doctrine of depravity (hamartiology) and how it relates to the gospel as the fuel of faith
• The distinction between being righteous (doing good) and doing good apart from faith
• The gospel is a declaration and announcement of God's victory
• The gospel is not advice or a list of rules, but news of God's Son
• The gospel is good news from God about his Son, not something humans can redefine
• The gospel is about Jesus' life, death, resurrection, and exaltation as God's Son
• The gospel is not about human hopes or dreams, but about God's Son and His work
• The gospel transforms lives by declaring who God's Son is and what He has done
• The importance of understanding the gospel in one's life
• Struggling with obedience or disobedience vs. receiving God's grace
• Lack of control in life and how the gospel applies to it
• The role of community in encouraging faith and perseverance
• Dangers of cultural trends that may lead to persecution of Christians
• The significance of gathering together for worship and communion
• The Eucharist is a sacred meal where God's gift of Jesus Christ is received in spiritual presence.

• The sacrament is a tangible expression of the gospel, allowing participants to see its goodness.
• Prayer is available for those seeking it before or instead of approaching the table.
