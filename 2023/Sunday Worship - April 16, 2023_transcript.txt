[0.00 --> 6.80]  I don't think we need to do this one.
[8.32 --> 10.28]  Unless you never play this one.
[10.56 --> 12.08]  We always play this one and you don't.
[12.08 --> 22.62]  What chord are you in?
[30.00 --> 40.00]  What?
[40.00 --> 42.00]  What?
[42.00 --> 44.00]  Two, I think.
[44.00 --> 56.00]  One more time.
[56.00 --> 72.28]  You're the lion of Judah.
[72.28 --> 82.28]  One more time.
[82.28 --> 92.28]  One more time.
[92.28 --> 94.28]  One more time.
[94.28 --> 104.28]  One more time.
[104.28 --> 114.28]  One more time.
[114.28 --> 118.28]  One more time.
[118.28 --> 126.28]  One more time.
[126.28 --> 128.28]  One more time.
[128.28 --> 130.28]  One more time.
[130.28 --> 140.28]  One more time.
[140.28 --> 142.28]  One more time.
[142.28 --> 144.28]  Two more time.
[144.28 --> 174.26]  Thank you.
[174.28 --> 204.26]  Thank you.
[204.28 --> 234.26]  Thank you.
[234.28 --> 264.26]  Thank you.
[264.28 --> 294.26]  Thank you.
[294.28 --> 324.26]  Thank you.
[324.28 --> 354.26]  Thank you.
[354.28 --> 384.26]  Thank you.
[384.28 --> 414.26]  Thank you.
[414.28 --> 444.26]  Thank you.
[444.28 --> 474.26]  Thank you.
[474.28 --> 504.26]  Thank you.
[504.28 --> 534.26]  Thank you.
[534.28 --> 564.26]  Thank you.
[564.28 --> 594.26]  Thank you.
[594.26 --> 624.24]  I don't think they've arrived yet.
[624.24 --> 654.22]  I get it.
[654.22 --> 656.04]  Because sometimes you're not so sure, right?
[656.22 --> 684.20]  And...
[684.20 --> 714.18]  I don't think you're not so much.
[714.18 --> 717.78]  All right. Morning. I'm all right. You?
[744.18 --> 774.16]  All right.
[774.18 --> 804.16]  All right.
[804.18 --> 834.16]  All right.
[834.18 --> 864.16]  All right.
[864.18 --> 894.16]  All right.
[894.16 --> 896.56]  Welcome to worship.
[896.96 --> 903.66]  A special welcome if you are visiting here, especially if you are here for Gems Sunday.
[903.84 --> 904.40]  Hi, girls.
[904.40 --> 910.98]  Okay. I'll work on him later.
[910.98 --> 917.22]  We are so excited to have you guys here with us in worship.
[917.42 --> 919.78]  My name is Chris. I'm one of the pastors here.
[920.42 --> 924.88]  And it's my privilege with a few others to lead in worship this morning.
[924.98 --> 930.32]  Before we begin in our ongoing rolling start, we have a couple announcements to make.
[930.44 --> 933.16]  And so first I'm going to invite Josh to the front.
[933.16 --> 935.16]  He's going to make an announcement.
[935.16 --> 935.18]  He's going to make an announcement.
[935.18 --> 938.76]  And then, Rob, you will follow behind Josh.
[938.76 --> 945.24]  Okay. I brought notes this time so I don't forget everything.
[946.44 --> 951.78]  Okay. So the Young Adults Bible Study is today, one hour after church, at Courtney Rorsma's residence.
[952.04 --> 954.54]  The address is in the email I sent you all.
[954.54 --> 957.10]  But if you have any questions, please come talk to me.
[957.54 --> 958.38]  Lunch is provided.
[959.10 --> 961.02]  And I'm really excited to see you all there.
[965.50 --> 967.32]  You got to go a little faster.
[971.32 --> 971.92]  Thank you.
[971.92 --> 978.28]  Good morning.
[978.64 --> 980.12]  My name is Rob.
[980.22 --> 981.12]  I'm an usher here.
[981.64 --> 984.06]  And I have an announcement this morning.
[984.06 --> 994.72]  And I believe this will be the first time in the history of our church that it will be an announcement that was generated by ChatGPT.
[996.72 --> 999.54]  So I'm going to read it word for word.
[1000.20 --> 1000.90]  Here we go.
[1002.88 --> 1004.90]  Beloved members of our congregation.
[1005.98 --> 1007.22]  It says that, right?
[1008.50 --> 1015.58]  We would like to take this opportunity to emphasize an important aspect of our Sunday worship services,
[1016.04 --> 1018.76]  particularly during special services and events.
[1020.44 --> 1020.74]  Oops.
[1021.38 --> 1028.04]  We respectfully request that you park your vehicles at the designated overflow parking lot located on the school grounds
[1028.04 --> 1036.12]  rather than the adjacent parking lot at the church in the unlikely event that you may encounter an orange fluorescent cone on the sidewalk.
[1036.12 --> 1047.10]  The overflow parking lot is identifiable by a sign and is located within a short walking distance of the event venue.
[1047.10 --> 1048.64]  That would be the sanctuary.
[1048.64 --> 1056.18]  It's design enables it to accommodate a large number of vehicles providing ample parking space for all attendees.
[1056.18 --> 1063.70]  This is especially important during special services and events when attendance tends to be high and parking can become limited.
[1063.70 --> 1071.96]  We would like to offer some insights into the mathematical properties of cones, which may seem unrelated,
[1071.96 --> 1079.74]  but will serve to illustrate the importance of making informed decisions when it comes to parking.
[1079.74 --> 1084.60]  It sounds a little bit less like ChatGPT and a little more like Justin Trudeau.
[1084.60 --> 1093.92]  The volume of a cone can be calculated using the formula one-third pi r squared h.
[1093.92 --> 1098.88]  What kind of pie?
[1100.42 --> 1102.98]  Raspberry pie, but that's neither here nor there.
[1102.98 --> 1106.84]  Sounds to me like you use ChatGPT 3.4 and not 4.0.
[1109.48 --> 1110.52]  The upshot.
[1110.80 --> 1111.54]  Thank you, Rob.
[1112.04 --> 1115.14]  If you see the cone out front, park next door.
[1120.40 --> 1120.92]  Good?
[1121.26 --> 1121.64]  All right.
[1121.64 --> 1128.70]  We also wanted to inform you on April 23rd at 6 p.m.
[1128.70 --> 1130.68]  So that's a Sunday night at 6 p.m.
[1130.68 --> 1141.90]  We are hosting an event for parents and for teenagers, preteens with the youth called Raising Kids in a Hyper-Sexualized Culture.
[1142.64 --> 1144.34]  And there's information in your e-bulletin.
[1144.52 --> 1146.04]  There's information on the church website.
[1146.54 --> 1149.10]  Really do want to encourage you all to attend that.
[1149.10 --> 1164.20]  Marvin Bravo, who is a licensed therapist and a counselor at Abbey Christian, will be coming with Faye Martin and leading us in some material and presentation and conversation around what it's like to raise kids in the world today.
[1164.70 --> 1169.48]  And we want to offer that to you and encourage you to join us April 23rd at 6 p.m.
[1169.48 --> 1173.90]  If you have any questions, you can grab me or Kevin afterwards and we'd be happy to address them.
[1174.56 --> 1177.20]  I'm going to invite you, as you are able now, to stand.
[1177.62 --> 1178.96]  We can begin our worship together.
[1178.96 --> 1190.94]  As we worship today, we do so in the presence of our God.
[1191.22 --> 1193.44]  And so he welcomes us and he greets us.
[1193.60 --> 1196.16]  I invite you to receive the greeting of our God.
[1196.16 --> 1208.72]  Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son, and our Savior, through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[1209.92 --> 1210.34]  Amen.
[1211.04 --> 1217.54]  I'm going to invite you, as you are able and as you are moved, to turn to those around you and welcome them into worship.
[1217.98 --> 1220.72]  Handshake, fist pump, a hug if you really know someone.
[1220.72 --> 1250.70]  Thank you.
[1250.72 --> 1266.64]  Please join me in our call to worship this morning from Psalm 100.
[1270.08 --> 1272.64]  Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth.
[1273.72 --> 1275.58]  Worship the Lord with gladness.
[1276.28 --> 1278.84]  Come before him with joyful songs.
[1278.84 --> 1282.60]  Know that the Lord is God.
[1282.80 --> 1284.12]  It is he who made us.
[1284.90 --> 1288.12]  We are his people, the sheep of his pasture.
[1289.58 --> 1292.64]  Enter his gates with thanksgiving, his courts with praise.
[1293.14 --> 1296.22]  Give thanks to him and praise his name.
[1297.18 --> 1300.50]  For the Lord is good and his love endures forever.
[1301.00 --> 1304.90]  His faithfulness continues through all generations.
[1304.90 --> 1305.24]  Test.
[1305.24 --> 1305.26]  Test.
[1321.26 --> 1322.80]  One.
[1325.30 --> 1326.50]  Come on.
[1326.50 --> 1334.54]  Come on.
[1334.54 --> 1336.56]  Come all you weary.
[1336.56 --> 1338.76]  Come all you thirsty.
[1339.32 --> 1343.26]  Come to the well that never was dry.
[1343.26 --> 1345.64]  Drink of the water.
[1345.96 --> 1349.18]  Come and thirst no more.
[1349.18 --> 1350.18]  Come all you sinners.
[1350.18 --> 1354.46]  Come all you sinners.
[1354.46 --> 1356.72]  Come find his mercy.
[1356.72 --> 1358.78]  Come to the table.
[1358.78 --> 1360.84]  He will satisfy.
[1360.84 --> 1363.36]  They have his goodness.
[1363.86 --> 1366.94]  Find what you're looking for.
[1366.94 --> 1374.80]  For God so loved the world that he gave us.
[1374.80 --> 1379.34]  His one and only son to save us.
[1379.34 --> 1384.54]  Whoever believes in him will live forever.
[1388.54 --> 1390.62]  Bring all your failures.
[1391.08 --> 1392.76]  Bring all your addictions.
[1392.76 --> 1397.18]  Come lay them down at the foot of the cross.
[1397.18 --> 1404.00]  Jesus is waiting there with open arms.
[1406.00 --> 1410.72]  For God so loved the world that he gave us.
[1410.80 --> 1415.26]  His one and only son to save us.
[1415.36 --> 1420.40]  Whoever believes in him will live forever.
[1420.40 --> 1428.48]  The power of hell forever defeated.
[1428.48 --> 1430.58]  Now it is well.
[1430.58 --> 1432.94]  I'm walking in freedom.
[1432.94 --> 1435.76]  For God so loved the world.
[1435.76 --> 1439.70]  God so loved the world.
[1441.40 --> 1443.68]  Praise God.
[1444.22 --> 1446.06]  Praise God.
[1446.06 --> 1468.38]  Praise God.
[1468.38 --> 1478.82]  Praise Him, praise Him for the wonders of His love.
[1479.42 --> 1488.90]  For God so loved the world that He gave us, His one and only Son to save.
[1488.90 --> 1498.28]  For God so loved the world that He gave us, His one and only Son to save us.
[1498.36 --> 1503.36]  Whoever believes in Him will live forever.
[1506.66 --> 1512.96]  The power of hell forever defeated, now it is well.
[1512.96 --> 1521.82]  I'm walking in freedom for God so loved, God so loved the world.
[1523.86 --> 1533.20]  Bring all your failures, bring your addictions, come lay them down at the foot of the cross.
[1533.80 --> 1539.76]  Jesus is waiting, God so loved the world.
[1542.96 --> 1567.30]  I love you, Lord.
[1567.30 --> 1573.30]  Oh, your mercy never fails me.
[1575.30 --> 1581.30]  All my days I've been held in your hands.
[1581.30 --> 1598.30]  From the moment that I wake up, until I lay my hand, I will sing of the goodness of God.
[1598.30 --> 1600.30]  God so loved the world.
[1600.30 --> 1605.30]  And all my life you have been faithful.
[1605.30 --> 1617.30]  And all my life you have been so, so good.
[1617.30 --> 1619.30]  I love you, Lord.
[1619.30 --> 1623.30]  With every breath that I am able.
[1623.30 --> 1631.30]  I will sing of the goodness of God.
[1631.30 --> 1635.30]  I love your voice.
[1635.30 --> 1639.30]  I love your voice.
[1639.30 --> 1645.30]  You have led me through the fire.
[1645.30 --> 1653.30]  In darkest night, you are close like no other.
[1653.30 --> 1655.30]  I've known you, Lord.
[1655.30 --> 1657.30]  I've known you as a father.
[1657.30 --> 1661.30]  I've known you as a friend.
[1661.30 --> 1669.30]  And I have lived in the goodness of God.
[1669.30 --> 1670.30]  God so loved the world.
[1670.30 --> 1673.30]  And all my life you have been so, so good.
[1673.30 --> 1677.30]  And all my life you have been faithful.
[1677.30 --> 1689.30]  And all my life you have been so, so good.
[1689.30 --> 1694.30]  With every breath that I am able.
[1694.30 --> 1701.30]  I will sing of the goodness of God.
[1701.30 --> 1708.30]  Your goodness is running after.
[1708.30 --> 1711.30]  It's running after me.
[1711.30 --> 1716.30]  Your goodness is running after.
[1716.30 --> 1719.30]  It's running after me.
[1719.30 --> 1724.30]  With my life laid down, I'm surrendered now.

[1784.30 --> 1800.30]  And I will sing of the goodness of God.
[1800.30 --> 1809.30]  And I will sing of the goodness of God.
[1809.30 --> 1811.30]  Please be seated.
[1811.30 --> 1812.30]  And join me in.
[1812.30 --> 1826.30]  Father, you ask us.
[1826.30 --> 1843.30]  You don't always ask us.
[1843.30 --> 1845.30]  We want justice.
[1845.30 --> 1846.30]  We want justice.
[1846.30 --> 1847.30]  We want justice.
[1847.30 --> 1850.30]  And we think more of ourselves than we should.
[1850.30 --> 1854.30]  We can only change when you can enjoy our lives and show us.
[1854.30 --> 1860.30]  You showed us the power and the sacrifices of life that changes everything.
[1860.30 --> 1866.30]  Father, you ask that you come there and change our hearts and minds and our wills.
[1866.30 --> 1867.30]  And we will be able to help us with this love.
[1867.30 --> 1868.30]  We will help us with this love.
[1868.30 --> 1869.30]  You can help us with this love.
[1869.30 --> 1870.30]  It's the love of us.

[2332.02 --> 2335.94]  For 50 years, girls and women from generation to generation
[2335.94 --> 2339.76]  have been uniting their voices to recite Micah 6 verse 8
[2339.76 --> 2340.98]  in their gems clubs.
[2341.32 --> 2344.52]  Whether their club is in Canada, the U.S., Uganda,
[2344.52 --> 2347.60]  or 13 other countries, it sounds like this.
[2348.10 --> 2350.38]  Emmanuel, gems, and gems leaders,
[2350.52 --> 2352.26]  what does the Lord require of you?
[2352.60 --> 2357.86]  Ask justly to love and hurt and walk humbly with our God.
[2358.06 --> 2360.18]  Micah 6 verse 8.
[2360.18 --> 2362.18]  This is who God is.
[2362.18 --> 2363.18]  This is who God is.
[2363.18 --> 2370.98]  I am the Lord who exercises kindness, justice, and righteousness on earth.

[2993.46 --> 3008.46]  Hello, my name is Courtney Grosma and I'm the coordinator for the Langley Emanuel CRC GEMS program. GEMS stands for Girls Everywhere Meeting the Savior and its vision is to see the girls around the world actively and enthusiastically expressing love for God and others.
[3008.46 --> 3023.46]  Girls equipped, motivated, and passionately engaged in living out their faith. The mission of GEMS is to bring girls everywhere into a living dynamic relationship with Jesus Christ.
[3023.46 --> 3042.46]  Langley Emanuel GEMS does this through Bible study, badges, crafts, songs, having conversations, and so much more. We currently have 10 leaders and 35 girls ranging from grades 3 to 7. This year the theme has been love, act, walk, which I have been a lot of people who are in the world.
[3042.46 --> 3061.46]  We currently have 10 leaders and 35 girls ranging from grades 3 to 7. This year the theme has been love, act, walk, which has allowed the girls to really dig into Micah 6 verse 8. Micah 6 verse 8 has been the aim for the GEMS program since its inception.
[3061.46 --> 3078.08]  But this year we were able to learn how acting justly, loving mercy, and walking humbly with God affects each aspect of our lives. When the girls learn to follow Micah 6 verse 8, it not only changes their world, but changes the world around them.
[3078.08 --> 3086.88]  The first offering today is for the budget and needs of our church. The second offering is for the GEMS Ministry of North America.
[3087.56 --> 3101.40]  This money is used to run GEMS on a larger scale, to develop curriculum, to provide staff, to support the various clubs, and to spread the word of what GEMS is and help set up new clubs, and so much more.
[3101.98 --> 3103.90]  Please give generously as God has given us.
[3108.08 --> 3138.06]  Please give generously as God has given us.
[3138.08 --> 3138.84]  Act your sleep, love mercy, walk humbly with you, God.

[3207.88 --> 3212.74]  It's closer and closer, the kingdom of heaven.
[3212.74 --> 3230.16]  And years from now we'll see, the fruit our hands are sown.
[3230.16 --> 3240.94]  Faith just like a seed, the only way it grows.
[3240.94 --> 3258.94]  Act justly, love mercy, walk humbly with you, God.
[3258.94 --> 3267.94]  In all things, in all ways, walk humbly with you, God.
[3267.94 --> 3279.46]  On the nights when the dark lasts a little bit longer
[3279.46 --> 3285.76]  When the wind and the storm is a little bit stronger
[3285.76 --> 3292.20]  When the fear in my heart digs a little bit deeper
[3292.20 --> 3298.60]  When my faith just ain't, it's a little bit weaker
[3298.60 --> 3303.76]  Where could I run to?
[3304.80 --> 3306.84]  Where could I go?
[3306.84 --> 3311.34]  Even when it feels like my world is shaking
[3311.34 --> 3314.44]  Even when I've had all that I can take
[3314.44 --> 3318.48]  I know, you never let me go
[3318.48 --> 3324.16]  And even when the waters won't stop rising
[3324.16 --> 3327.20]  Even when I'm caught in the dead of a night
[3327.20 --> 3330.84]  I know, no matter how it ends
[3330.84 --> 3332.84]  You're with me even then
[3332.84 --> 3333.84]  You're with me even then
[3333.84 --> 3337.84]  You're with me even then
[3337.84 --> 3342.84]  And the days up ahead look a little bit brighter
[3342.84 --> 3348.84]  But the grip of the past holds a little bit tighter
[3348.84 --> 3355.84]  I'm reminded your grace never asked for perfection
[3355.84 --> 3361.84]  I'm restored cause I'm yours and I stand forgiving
[3361.84 --> 3366.84]  Even when it feels like my world is shaking
[3366.84 --> 3370.84]  Even when I've had all that I can take
[3370.84 --> 3377.84]  I know, you never let me go
[3377.84 --> 3381.84]  And even when the waters won't stop rising
[3381.84 --> 3384.84]  Even when I'm caught in the dead of a night
[3384.84 --> 3388.84]  I know, no matter how it ends
[3388.84 --> 3392.84]  You're with me even then
[3392.84 --> 3396.84]  I would love to invite all of the kids to come forward
[3396.84 --> 3400.84]  And come see Hank the Hound for a second
[3400.84 --> 3402.84]  Hi kids
[3402.84 --> 3405.84]  You did, we were pretty quick
[3405.84 --> 3406.84]  Come on forward, come to
[3406.84 --> 3408.84]  Oh, no touching please
[3408.84 --> 3410.84]  I'm a little sensitive
[3413.84 --> 3414.84]  Alright, good morning
[3414.84 --> 3417.84]  Good morning, good morning everyone
[3417.84 --> 3420.84]  How's everyone doing?
[3420.84 --> 3424.84]  Good, what's with all the girls in the gray shirts?
[3424.84 --> 3426.84]  It's Gems, Hank
[3426.84 --> 3427.84]  It's Gems Sunday
[3427.84 --> 3429.84]  Gems?
[3429.84 --> 3431.84]  Tell them about Hems
[3431.84 --> 3432.84]  Hems?
[3432.84 --> 3434.84]  Yeah, tell them about Hems
[3434.84 --> 3436.84]  Hank is part of a group called Hems
[3436.84 --> 3440.84]  Hounds everywhere meeting the savior
[3441.84 --> 3444.84]  We used to call it Hanks everywhere meeting the savior
[3444.84 --> 3446.84]  But I was the only one who showed up
[3446.84 --> 3448.84]  So we switched it to Hems
[3448.84 --> 3449.84]  And now who comes?
[3449.84 --> 3452.84]  Me, Peggy the pooch
[3452.84 --> 3454.84]  And Uncle Wrinkles
[3454.84 --> 3455.84]  That's right
[3455.84 --> 3457.84]  Do you want to tell them what we do there?
[3457.84 --> 3458.84]  Mm-hmm
[3458.84 --> 3460.84]  Should we talk about when I come?
[3460.84 --> 3461.84]  Yeah
[3461.84 --> 3463.84]  Well, what happens when I come, Hank?
[3463.84 --> 3465.84]  When he comes, we do Bible study
[3465.84 --> 3467.84]  And eat some snacks
[3467.84 --> 3469.84]  And tell jokes
[3469.84 --> 3471.84]  And then what happens when I can't make it?
[3471.84 --> 3473.84]  We really just lay there quietly
[3473.84 --> 3474.84]  Oh
[3474.84 --> 3476.84]  So you don't do the Bible study?
[3476.84 --> 3478.84]  No, we're pretty dependent on you
[3478.84 --> 3479.84]  Yeah, that's fair
[3479.84 --> 3481.84]  So Gems is very fun
[3481.84 --> 3482.84]  We've heard lots about them
[3482.84 --> 3484.84]  And they're gonna stick around
[3484.84 --> 3485.84]  And listen to Pastor Chris
[3485.84 --> 3486.84]  And sing some more songs
[3486.84 --> 3488.84]  But all of these kids here
[3488.84 --> 3490.84]  We're gonna go back and do some children's worship time
[3490.84 --> 3491.84]  Right, kids?
[3491.84 --> 3492.84]  Is that a good idea?
[3492.84 --> 3494.84]  Sounds fun!
[3494.84 --> 3496.84]  Alright, so why don't we pray?
[3496.84 --> 3498.84]  And then we'll run off the children's worship time
[3498.84 --> 3499.84]  Okay?
[3499.84 --> 3502.84]  And then we'll have some fun back there
[3502.84 --> 3503.84]  So let's fold our hands
[3503.84 --> 3504.84]  Close our eyes quick
[3504.84 --> 3505.84]  We'll do a little prayer
[3505.84 --> 3506.84]  And then we'll head off
[3506.84 --> 3507.84]  Dear God, thank you for this day
[3507.84 --> 3509.84]  Thank you that it's Gems Sunday
[3509.84 --> 3511.84]  And that we get to hear about all of the things that the Gems do
[3511.84 --> 3513.84]  And God, we thank you for all these kids too
[3513.84 --> 3514.84]  That they're a part of this church
[3514.84 --> 3516.84]  And that we're gonna go into the back
[3516.84 --> 3518.84]  And do some children's worship time as well
[3518.84 --> 3521.84]  And learn more about what it is to live for you
[3521.84 --> 3523.84]  And to live in this world in relationship with you
[3523.84 --> 3525.84]  So be with us as we go to the back
[3525.84 --> 3527.84]  Be with the Gems and the adults as they stay here
[3527.84 --> 3530.84]  And may we grow closer to you and closer to each other
[3530.84 --> 3531.84]  In your name, amen
[3531.84 --> 3534.84]  Alright, let's do the blessing
[3534.84 --> 3536.84]  Everybody stand
[3539.84 --> 3541.84]  Alright, let's say it together
[3541.84 --> 3542.84]  You kids ready?
[3542.84 --> 3545.84]  The Lord be with you
[3557.84 --> 3558.84]  Good morning
[3558.84 --> 3562.84]  Good morning everyone
[3562.84 --> 3563.84]  My name's Eric
[3563.84 --> 3565.84]  I'm on council at the church here
[3565.84 --> 3567.84]  Just wanted to give you a little update
[3567.84 --> 3568.84]  We had a meeting this week
[3568.84 --> 3570.84]  So I'll give you a little update on what we're up to
[3570.84 --> 3572.84]  The evening started off great
[3572.84 --> 3574.84]  We had dinner together
[3574.84 --> 3576.84]  Pastor Chris cooked dinner for us
[3576.84 --> 3580.84]  Chicken, potatoes, some veg
[3580.84 --> 3581.84]  Oh, veggie
[3581.84 --> 3598.84]  Hello
[3598.84 --> 3602.84]  We had a Mexico missions presentation
[3602.84 --> 3605.84]  From the young people who went
[3605.84 --> 3609.84]  Josiah, Matias and Ali gave a real great
[3609.84 --> 3613.84]  Notes on their experience
[3613.84 --> 3614.84]  It was fantastic to hear from them
[3614.84 --> 3616.84]  And what's been going on there
[3616.84 --> 3617.84]  And what they were able to do
[3617.84 --> 3619.84]  Once we follow
[3619.84 --> 3622.84]  We followed that up with Anthony Janssen
[3622.84 --> 3623.84]  Came and did from classes
[3623.84 --> 3626.84]  And did a restorative practices presentation
[3626.84 --> 3627.84]  For us as council
[3627.84 --> 3630.84]  Dealing with restoring relationships
[3630.84 --> 3633.84]  And churches that need that kind of work
[3633.84 --> 3636.84]  After that we went into the meeting
[3636.84 --> 3638.84]  I know this was announced last week
[3638.84 --> 3641.84]  But Maria Wind has taken the new job
[3641.84 --> 3644.84]  Of communications assistant in the office
[3644.84 --> 3647.84]  So we thank her for taking that on
[3647.84 --> 3652.84]  The council nomination process has started
[3652.84 --> 3655.84]  So if you know anyone who wants to be part of the council
[3655.84 --> 3658.84]  And join us for all the fun and games we have
[3658.84 --> 3659.84]  It's good to
[3659.84 --> 3662.84]  There's nomination forms in the office
[3662.84 --> 3665.84]  And Pastor Chris already announced it
[3665.84 --> 3668.84]  But on April 23rd there's going to be a youth event here
[3668.84 --> 3670.84]  For parents to join in on that
[3670.84 --> 3671.84]  So thank you
[3671.84 --> 3672.84]  Thank you
[3672.84 --> 3674.84]  Thank you
[3674.84 --> 3675.84]  Yeah?
[3675.84 --> 3676.84]  Yeah?
[3676.84 --> 3677.84]  There?
[3677.84 --> 3678.84]  Oh!
[3678.84 --> 3679.84]  Sounds...
[3679.84 --> 3680.84]  Okay!
[3680.84 --> 3681.84]  We'll see how long it lasts for!
[3681.84 --> 3694.84]  We adapt and move on
[3694.84 --> 3700.84]  I'm going to lead us in our church family prayer at this time
[3700.84 --> 3704.84]  And so I'm going to invite you to bow your heads
[3704.84 --> 3706.84]  Join your hearts with me as we pray
[3707.84 --> 3710.84]  Before we pray just a quick announcement
[3710.84 --> 3715.84]  In addition to some of the things that you may have read in the e-bulletin
[3715.84 --> 3721.84]  First, if you are unaware and have been visiting with us for a while
[3721.84 --> 3725.84]  And would like to have more information about what goes on here
[3725.84 --> 3729.84]  One of the best ways to do that is to get the e-bulletin and midweek memo
[3729.84 --> 3734.84]  And so if you were to email communications at LICRC.ca
[3734.84 --> 3736.84]  And say, hey, please put me on that list
[3736.84 --> 3739.84]  You would get put on that email list and you would get the bulletin
[3739.84 --> 3744.84]  We have in the last number of years moved away from paper bulletins
[3744.84 --> 3747.84]  And so this is the way to communicate that information
[3747.84 --> 3748.84]  First, that
[3748.84 --> 3751.84]  In addition to what you may have read there
[3751.84 --> 3757.84]  This morning we're going to pray for Peter and Trudy DeVries and their family
[3757.84 --> 3761.84]  Trudy's nephew, Sean, just 21 years old
[3761.84 --> 3764.84]  Passed away really suddenly last Sunday
[3764.84 --> 3767.84]  They're not sure exactly what took place
[3767.84 --> 3770.84]  And so of course we're praying for them and for their family
[3770.84 --> 3777.84]  And for everyone who is mourning and crying out and wondering just what is going on
[3778.84 --> 3782.84]  With that I invite you to join your heart with me in prayer
[3789.84 --> 3795.84]  Heavenly Father, as we gather as a church family for worship
[3795.84 --> 3802.84]  We are so grateful that we come into this place and you meet us here
[3804.84 --> 3809.84]  We are so grateful for the promise that we're two or three are gathered in your name
[3810.84 --> 3812.84]  That you are with us
[3814.84 --> 3820.84]  God, we are amazed week in and week out about how you show up in power
[3820.84 --> 3822.84]  Through the working of your Holy Spirit
[3822.84 --> 3825.84]  As we sing your praises and as we hear your word
[3827.84 --> 3834.84]  God, we are so grateful that in these ordinary acts of gathering together around your word
[3835.84 --> 3838.84]  In worship that you meet us in extraordinary ways
[3841.84 --> 3843.84]  Father, as we come together
[3843.84 --> 3845.84]  We come out of habit
[3846.84 --> 3847.84]  We come out of need
[3847.84 --> 3849.84]  We come crying out to you
[3850.84 --> 3851.84]  We come, Lord God
[3851.84 --> 3854.84]  Hoping and praying that you would meet us in this place
[3855.84 --> 3857.84]  And so open the eyes of our heart
[3858.84 --> 3860.84]  To see you, Lord Jesus
[3862.84 --> 3865.84]  Move in us by the renewing of our minds
[3866.84 --> 3867.84]  By the transforming of our lives
[3867.84 --> 3868.84]  That we might go from this place
[3868.84 --> 3870.84]  That we might go from this place
[3870.84 --> 3873.84]  In a spiritual act of worship
[3874.84 --> 3877.84]  That we might as the gems have taught us
[3878.84 --> 3881.84]  That we might go with you
[3882.84 --> 3885.84]  That we might go, Lord God
[3886.84 --> 3888.84]  In the power of your name
[3889.84 --> 3890.84]  And of your word
[3891.84 --> 3892.84]  To act justly
[3893.84 --> 3894.84]  To love mercy
[3894.84 --> 3896.84]  And to walk humbly
[3897.84 --> 3898.84]  With you
[3899.84 --> 3900.84]  We praise your name, God
[3901.84 --> 3902.84]  For this Gems ministry
[3903.84 --> 3905.84]  For 50 years of faithful service
[3906.84 --> 3908.84]  In leading girls and young women
[3909.84 --> 3910.84]  To meeting you, our Savior
[3911.84 --> 3914.84]  We pray a prayer of blessing on them
[3915.84 --> 3916.84]  And on their counselors
[3917.84 --> 3918.84]  And on all the work that is done
[3918.84 --> 3920.84]  In shaping and forming faith in you
[3921.84 --> 3923.84]  Bless that work, we pray
[3925.84 --> 3927.84]  Bless them and all that they do
[3928.84 --> 3930.84]  And as they get excited for Gems camp coming up
[3931.84 --> 3933.84]  We pray a blessing on that
[3934.84 --> 3939.84]  Father, we pray for your hand to be on all the ministries
[3940.84 --> 3942.84]  And mission of this church
[3943.84 --> 3945.84]  We thank you for the way that we see you at work
[3946.84 --> 3949.84]  And we pray that we would use those opportunities
[3949.84 --> 3950.84]  The opportunities of seeing you
[3950.84 --> 3952.84]  To trust that you are at work
[3953.84 --> 3954.84]  Even when we can't see it
[3955.84 --> 3958.84]  We thank you for all the volunteers
[3959.84 --> 3961.84]  And the people of this church family that make those things possible
[3962.84 --> 3966.84]  We pray, Lord, that you would bless and keep each one
[3967.84 --> 3972.84]  We pray, Lord, that you would hold back experiences of fatigue
[3972.84 --> 3973.84]  And frustration
[3974.84 --> 3979.84]  And that you would allow us to serve with joy and compassion
[3983.84 --> 3984.84]  God, as we come before you
[3985.84 --> 3987.84]  We also want to lift up those whom we know and love
[3988.84 --> 3989.84]  Who are receiving treatment
[3990.84 --> 3991.84]  Who are receiving care
[3991.84 --> 3994.84]  We continue to pray for Cy and for John
[3994.84 --> 3996.84]  As they receive different treatments
[3997.84 --> 3998.84]  For cancer
[3999.84 --> 4001.84]  Asking that you would bless them and keep them
[4002.84 --> 4005.84]  That you would bring both healing and peace to them
[4006.84 --> 4010.84]  In the midst of these hard days and these trials of health
[4010.84 --> 4016.84]  God, for all of us who are dealing with aging bodies
[4017.84 --> 4018.84]  Or breaking bodies
[4019.84 --> 4020.84]  We pray that you would give strength
[4021.84 --> 4023.84]  That you would give healing
[4024.84 --> 4029.84]  Whether that healing comes by medical means and by treatment
[4030.84 --> 4032.84]  Or comes by miraculous means
[4033.84 --> 4034.84]  We pray, God, that in all of it
[4035.84 --> 4037.84]  We would have eyes to see that it is by your hand
[4037.84 --> 4040.84]  And help us to praise you for it
[4040.84 --> 4046.84]  Lord, our God, for those who are caring for loved ones
[4047.84 --> 4050.84]  Whether they are parents or family members
[4051.84 --> 4054.84]  Or friends who are struggling
[4055.84 --> 4059.84]  We pray that you would bring healing and hope
[4060.84 --> 4063.84]  We pray that in those relationships
[4063.84 --> 4067.84]  That you would bring restoration and strength
[4068.84 --> 4069.84]  And we pray, Lord God
[4070.84 --> 4073.84]  For those of us who are providing care in whatever circumstance
[4074.84 --> 4075.84]  We pray for endurance
[4076.84 --> 4078.84]  We pray that you would strengthen caregivers
[4079.84 --> 4082.84]  To run the race that is marked out for them
[4083.84 --> 4087.84]  And that in the midst of their serving someone in love
[4087.84 --> 4092.84]  That they would do so with the heart of you, Jesus, our Savior
[4093.84 --> 4097.84]  That we would do so with a kind of compassion that reveals your love for the world
[4098.84 --> 4105.84]  Father, we pray as well for those whom we know and love who are mourning
[4106.84 --> 4110.84]  We pray, God, for Peter, Trudy, and for the whole family
[4110.84 --> 4113.84]  As they mourn the loss of Sean
[4114.84 --> 4116.84]  In a crying out of grief, Lord God
[4117.84 --> 4119.84]  We don't understand, it doesn't make sense
[4120.84 --> 4122.84]  We don't know how these things can happen
[4123.84 --> 4124.84]  Or how you let them happen
[4125.84 --> 4126.84]  And we wonder
[4127.84 --> 4128.84]  We're confused
[4129.84 --> 4130.84]  In our hurt
[4131.84 --> 4132.84]  In our despair
[4133.84 --> 4135.84]  Gather us up with your love
[4136.84 --> 4137.84]  Draw us to yourself
[4137.84 --> 4140.84]  That even though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death
[4141.84 --> 4142.84]  We would fear no evil
[4143.84 --> 4144.84]  For you are with us
[4145.84 --> 4151.84]  That even though we face and feel anxiety
[4152.84 --> 4154.84]  That we would cast our cares upon you
[4155.84 --> 4157.84]  And that you would uphold us
[4158.84 --> 4161.84]  Help us in our grief
[4162.84 --> 4166.84]  Sustain us in our joy
[4168.84 --> 4170.84]  Whether we mourn or whether we rejoice
[4171.84 --> 4172.84]  We do so, Lord God
[4173.84 --> 4174.84]  As your body together
[4176.84 --> 4179.84]  We do so coming to you for nourishment
[4180.84 --> 4181.84]  And so, Lord God, as we open your word
[4182.84 --> 4184.84]  Nourish us by its proclamation
[4185.84 --> 4187.84]  Nourish us by the gospel of Jesus Christ
[4188.84 --> 4189.84]  That in these words spoken
[4190.84 --> 4191.84]  We would hear the very voice of Jesus
[4192.84 --> 4194.84]  Speaking to our hearts
[4194.84 --> 4197.84]  Open our minds to you
[4198.84 --> 4199.84]  In this moment
[4200.84 --> 4201.84]  In Jesus name we pray
[4202.84 --> 4203.84]  Amen
[4204.84 --> 4205.84]  Amen
[4206.84 --> 4207.84]  Amen
[4208.84 --> 4209.84]  Amen
[4210.84 --> 4211.84]  Amen
[4212.84 --> 4213.84]  Amen
[4214.84 --> 4215.84]  Amen
[4216.84 --> 4217.84]  Amen
[4217.84 --> 4218.84]  Amen
[4218.84 --> 4219.84]  Amen
[4219.84 --> 4220.84]  Amen
[4220.84 --> 4221.84]  So, it was
[4221.84 --> 4222.84]  Perhaps
[4223.84 --> 4224.84]  said in passing
[4225.84 --> 4227.84]  But this year
[4228.84 --> 4230.84]  Is the 50th anniversary
[4231.84 --> 4233.84]  Of the GEMS ministry
[4234.84 --> 4235.84]  Five-zero
[4236.84 --> 4240.84]  Now, at some point in that time
[4241.84 --> 4242.84]  It changed names
[4243.84 --> 4244.84]  Girls up front
[4244.84 --> 4245.84]  Do you know
[4245.84 --> 4246.84]  Do you know
[4246.84 --> 4247.84]  Counselors, not you
[4247.84 --> 4248.84]  Do you know what it was called
[4248.84 --> 4249.84]  Let's say
[4249.84 --> 4250.84]  When your moms
[4250.84 --> 4252.84]  Or your family members
[4253.84 --> 4254.84]  Did this same program
[4254.84 --> 4255.84]  When they were little?
[4256.84 --> 4257.84]  Calvinettes
[4258.84 --> 4259.84]  What a lovely name
[4259.84 --> 4260.84]  Am I right?
[4261.84 --> 4262.84]  I think the name change was great
[4263.84 --> 4264.84]  Right?
[4264.84 --> 4265.84]  Yeah, absolutely
[4265.84 --> 4266.84]  But here's what I'm interested in
[4267.84 --> 4268.84]  Okay, so
[4268.84 --> 4269.84]  These girls here
[4269.84 --> 4271.84]  Are in our current GEMS program
[4271.84 --> 4272.84]  You counselors are with them
[4272.84 --> 4273.84]  So I'm going to invite you
[4273.84 --> 4274.84]  Just to stand
[4274.84 --> 4275.84]  For a second
[4275.84 --> 4276.84]  Right?
[4276.84 --> 4277.84]  We'll call this maybe a
[4277.84 --> 4278.84]  Seventh-inning stretch
[4279.84 --> 4280.84]  Okay, so this
[4281.84 --> 4282.84]  Is representative
[4283.84 --> 4284.84]  Not everyone who comes to GEMS
[4284.84 --> 4285.84]  Is here this morning
[4286.84 --> 4288.84]  But this is representative of that group
[4289.84 --> 4290.84]  Now, if you
[4291.84 --> 4292.84]  At some point in your life
[4293.84 --> 4294.84]  Were part of GEMS
[4295.84 --> 4296.84]  Now, I said GEMS
[4297.84 --> 4298.84]  So if you attended this program
[4298.84 --> 4299.84]  While it was called GEMS
[4299.84 --> 4300.84]  Would you also please
[4301.84 --> 4302.84]  Stand up?
[4305.84 --> 4306.84]  There's a few
[4306.84 --> 4307.84]  There we go
[4307.84 --> 4308.84]  Coming around
[4308.84 --> 4309.84]  Excellent
[4309.84 --> 4310.84]  Thank you for finally being called in
[4311.84 --> 4313.84]  Now, if you attended this program
[4313.84 --> 4315.84]  When it was called Calvinettes
[4316.84 --> 4317.84]  Would you please stand up?
[4323.84 --> 4324.84]  Yeah, some people are begrudgingly
[4324.84 --> 4326.84]  Like I'm not really that old, am I?
[4326.84 --> 4328.84]  Yes
[4329.84 --> 4330.84]  Yes, you are
[4331.84 --> 4332.84]  But just take a moment
[4332.84 --> 4333.84]  Girls up front
[4333.84 --> 4334.84]  And look around
[4337.84 --> 4338.84]  Right?
[4338.84 --> 4339.84]  All of these women standing here
[4340.84 --> 4343.84]  Have done what you are doing
[4344.84 --> 4347.84]  All of these women have met their savior
[4348.84 --> 4350.84]  Through the kinds of work that you guys get to do
[4350.84 --> 4352.84]  Whether it's crafts or counseling
[4352.84 --> 4353.84]  Or praying together
[4353.84 --> 4354.84]  Or
[4355.84 --> 4357.84]  Half-heartedly dancing with streamers
[4358.84 --> 4359.84]  For a camera
[4359.84 --> 4360.84]  Although Olivia, you did great work
[4363.84 --> 4365.84]  The legacy of the GEMS program
[4366.84 --> 4368.84]  Really is a beautiful thing
[4369.84 --> 4372.84]  And as these women have shared that story
[4372.84 --> 4374.84]  And as you are living into it
[4374.84 --> 4375.84]  I pray
[4375.84 --> 4376.84]  That maybe
[4378.84 --> 4379.84]  You might be able to stand up
[4379.84 --> 4380.84]  In 20 years time
[4381.84 --> 4382.84]  And do the same
[4383.84 --> 4384.84]  Or 25 years time
[4384.84 --> 4385.84]  Whether it's with your own girls
[4386.84 --> 4387.84]  Or as a counselor
[4388.84 --> 4389.84]  Or just part of a community
[4389.84 --> 4390.84]  That does this kind of thing for you
[4391.84 --> 4393.84]  Because this is an amazing picture
[4393.84 --> 4394.84]  Of discipleship
[4394.84 --> 4395.84]  And Christian family
[4396.84 --> 4397.84]  In the church together
[4397.84 --> 4398.84]  And I just want everyone to see it
[4398.84 --> 4399.84]  And I want to praise God
[4400.84 --> 4401.84]  For it
[4401.84 --> 4402.84]  So thank you for standing
[4402.84 --> 4403.84]  You may have a seat
[4405.84 --> 4407.84]  Now for that entire duration
[4408.84 --> 4409.84]  Of 50 years
[4409.84 --> 4411.84]  The GEMS and the Calvinettes
[4412.84 --> 4413.84]  Have focused their work on
[4414.84 --> 4415.84]  Micah 6 verse 8
[4416.84 --> 4417.84]  So we're going to spend some time
[4417.84 --> 4418.84]  Focusing on that together
[4419.84 --> 4420.84]  This morning
[4420.84 --> 4421.84]  I'm going to read
[4421.84 --> 4423.84]  Actually starting at verse 6
[4424.84 --> 4425.84]  So that we can highlight
[4425.84 --> 4427.84]  The impact of verse 8
[4427.84 --> 4428.84]  When we get there
[4428.84 --> 4429.84]  So if you have a Bible open
[4429.84 --> 4432.84]  I invite you to find Micah 6
[4433.84 --> 4435.84]  And to read along with me
[4436.84 --> 4438.84]  It will be on the screen
[4438.84 --> 4439.84]  Behind me as well
[4442.84 --> 4446.84]  Micah writes
[4447.84 --> 4450.84]  With what shall I come before the Lord?
[4450.84 --> 4455.84]  And bow down before the exalted God
[4456.84 --> 4459.84]  Shall I come before him with burnt offerings?
[4460.84 --> 4461.84]  With calves a year old?
[4462.84 --> 4465.84]  Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams?
[4466.84 --> 4468.84]  With ten thousand rivers of olive oil?
[4469.84 --> 4472.84]  Shall I offer my firstborn for my transgression
[4473.84 --> 4476.84]  The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
[4476.84 --> 4478.84]  And here's verse 8
[4478.84 --> 4480.84]  He has shown you, O mortal
[4481.84 --> 4482.84]  What is good
[4483.84 --> 4485.84]  And what does the Lord require of you?
[4485.84 --> 4487.84]  To walk with you
[4488.84 --> 4489.84]  To walk with you
[4490.84 --> 4491.84]  And walk with you
[4492.84 --> 4493.84]  Very good
[4494.84 --> 4495.84]  Micah 6 verse 8
[4495.84 --> 4497.84]  We all had to learn to say the scripture verse
[4497.84 --> 4498.84]  On the thing overhead, right?
[4498.84 --> 4499.84]  That's right
[4499.84 --> 4500.84]  To act justly
[4500.84 --> 4501.84]  To love mercy
[4501.84 --> 4503.84]  And to walk humbly
[4503.84 --> 4505.84]  With our God
[4505.84 --> 4507.84]  This is the word of the Lord
[4507.84 --> 4521.84]  So in order to help us see the beauty, I think
[4521.84 --> 4524.84]  Of what this text can mean for us
[4525.84 --> 4529.84]  I want to just underscore a little bit of the history
[4530.84 --> 4531.84]  Of what's going on
[4532.84 --> 4536.84]  And so Micah is a prophet in the region of Judah
[4537.84 --> 4539.84]  Now I think we have a map that we can throw up on screen
[4540.84 --> 4544.84]  And so this is the general area of Israel
[4545.84 --> 4546.84]  Modern day Israel as well
[4546.84 --> 4548.84]  And in the southern part of it
[4548.84 --> 4550.84]  So the bottom part of the map
[4550.84 --> 4551.84]  You see a region called Judah
[4552.84 --> 4553.84]  And then north of that
[4553.84 --> 4555.84]  You'll see a region called Israel
[4556.84 --> 4557.84]  And then even north yet of that
[4557.84 --> 4560.84]  You'll see a kingdom of Syria
[4561.84 --> 4563.84]  Micah is a prophet
[4564.84 --> 4567.84]  In the latter part of the 8th century B.C.
[4568.84 --> 4572.84]  He starts prophesying sometime around 739 B.C.
[4572.84 --> 4575.84]  And we know this because in Micah 1.1
[4576.84 --> 4577.84]  It says the word of the Lord
[4577.84 --> 4579.84]  That came to Micah of Moresheth
[4580.84 --> 4582.84]  During the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah
[4583.84 --> 4584.84]  So we have this king
[4585.84 --> 4589.84]  The reign of kings marking out history for us
[4590.84 --> 4592.84]  Now at this time in this region
[4593.84 --> 4595.84]  Syria is a ruling power
[4596.84 --> 4598.84]  The northern kingdom of Israel
[4598.84 --> 4600.84]  So Israel has split into two
[4601.84 --> 4602.84]  Israel and Judah
[4603.84 --> 4604.84]  The northern kingdom of Israel
[4605.84 --> 4607.84]  Has fallen in 722 B.C.
[4608.84 --> 4609.84]  With the siege of Samaria
[4610.84 --> 4611.84]  And so if you have really good eyes
[4611.84 --> 4613.84]  You'll see in Israel Samaria there
[4614.84 --> 4616.84]  That's the capital of that region
[4617.84 --> 4620.84]  And now Judah, the southern kingdom
[4621.84 --> 4625.84]  Spent some time in alliance with Egypt
[4625.84 --> 4627.84]  The king of Egypt
[4628.84 --> 4631.84]  Trying to get out from under the rule
[4632.84 --> 4634.84]  Of the Assyrian Empire
[4635.84 --> 4637.84]  And what happens as a result of that
[4638.84 --> 4640.84]  Is that Hezekiah, the king, gets fined
[4641.84 --> 4642.84]  And the region kind of gets divided up
[4643.84 --> 4647.84]  Now, because Judah exists where it does
[4648.84 --> 4649.84]  Right?
[4649.84 --> 4653.84]  It's kind of in the middle of this fertile crescent region
[4654.84 --> 4656.84]  And you have Syria to the north
[4657.84 --> 4658.84]  And Egypt to the southwest
[4659.84 --> 4661.84]  And Moab and Edom to the southeast
[4662.84 --> 4664.84]  And beyond that the Arabian Peninsula
[4665.84 --> 4666.84]  What that means is
[4667.84 --> 4669.84]  It has become a sort of hub of commerce
[4670.84 --> 4671.84]  And economic prosperity
[4672.84 --> 4673.84]  Right?
[4673.84 --> 4676.84]  So to get anywhere through and around the fertile crescent
[4676.84 --> 4679.84]  You have to go through the region of Judah
[4680.84 --> 4682.84]  Now one of the things that that ends up meaning
[4683.84 --> 4687.84]  Is that there is a time of like economic revolution
[4688.84 --> 4691.84]  And prosperity that's happening for these people
[4692.84 --> 4693.84]  That is, they're really wealthy
[4694.84 --> 4695.84]  They have everything they need
[4696.84 --> 4697.84]  Life is good
[4698.84 --> 4699.84]  Right?
[4699.84 --> 4702.84]  People are generally feeling pretty good
[4702.84 --> 4704.84]  About the way things are
[4705.84 --> 4708.84]  At least the leaders and the ruling class
[4709.84 --> 4710.84]  In the temples and in the palaces do
[4711.84 --> 4712.84]  And those who kind of run the markets
[4713.84 --> 4714.84]  Right?
[4714.84 --> 4715.84]  That everyone has to come through
[4716.84 --> 4719.84]  And then that kind of has the effect of lifting everyone up
[4720.84 --> 4723.84]  But that wealth, that material blessing
[4724.84 --> 4725.84]  All the stuff that they have
[4726.84 --> 4727.84]  Is a bit of a mixed blessing for them
[4727.84 --> 4732.84]  And when you look at the impact of what happens here
[4733.84 --> 4736.84]  It becomes clear that the people fall into
[4737.84 --> 4739.84]  A kind of selfish materialism
[4740.84 --> 4742.84]  That is, they wanted more and more stuff
[4743.84 --> 4744.84]  They wanted the next new thing
[4745.84 --> 4747.84]  Whatever that was back then
[4748.84 --> 4750.84]  And then they started to think about religion
[4751.84 --> 4753.84]  And about religious practices
[4753.84 --> 4756.84]  As a way to get more stuff
[4757.84 --> 4760.84]  As a way to have more material items
[4761.84 --> 4762.84]  Right?
[4762.84 --> 4764.84]  As a sort of idea that God is there
[4765.84 --> 4766.84]  To make you feel good
[4767.84 --> 4768.84]  And to make your life fun
[4769.84 --> 4770.84]  And so people would pray
[4771.84 --> 4772.84]  Or they would go to temple
[4773.84 --> 4774.84]  Or they would make sacrifices
[4775.84 --> 4776.84]  Because what they wanted was to get something back
[4777.84 --> 4778.84]  From God
[4778.84 --> 4779.84]  And so God
[4781.84 --> 4782.84]  And religion
[4782.84 --> 4784.84]  Kind of becomes like a vending machine
[4785.84 --> 4786.84]  Right?
[4786.84 --> 4788.84]  You know what happens when you put a coin
[4789.84 --> 4790.84]  Well, it's probably a bill now actually
[4791.84 --> 4792.84]  Right?
[4792.84 --> 4793.84]  A bill in a vending machine
[4793.84 --> 4794.84]  Or tap it
[4794.84 --> 4795.84]  And then you push C4
[4796.84 --> 4797.84]  Right?
[4797.84 --> 4798.84]  And then chips or whatever falls out
[4799.84 --> 4800.84]  Right?
[4800.84 --> 4801.84]  That's how they started treating God
[4802.84 --> 4803.84]  They used their religious practices
[4804.84 --> 4805.84]  To get something in return
[4805.84 --> 4806.84]  Put in the right prayer
[4806.84 --> 4807.84]  And you'll get a bigger harvest
[4808.84 --> 4809.84]  Sacrifice the right amount
[4810.84 --> 4811.84]  And your son would get the apprenticeship
[4812.84 --> 4813.84]  With the neighbor's business
[4814.84 --> 4815.84]  Go to church enough
[4815.84 --> 4816.84]  And the girls at school
[4816.84 --> 4817.84]  Will stop bullying you
[4818.84 --> 4819.84]  Because you've done the right thing
[4820.84 --> 4822.84]  And with that sort of cost benefit
[4823.84 --> 4825.84]  Utilitarian approach to religion
[4826.84 --> 4827.84]  What the New Testament will later call
[4828.84 --> 4829.84]  The cost of discipleship
[4830.84 --> 4831.84]  The call to obedience
[4831.84 --> 4834.84]  The moral impact on people's lives
[4834.84 --> 4835.84]  Starts to be lost
[4836.84 --> 4838.84]  There's a breakdown of personal
[4839.84 --> 4840.84]  And social values
[4841.84 --> 4843.84]  There's one Bible scholar who said
[4844.84 --> 4846.84]  Even the religious leaders
[4847.84 --> 4848.84]  The priests and the prophets
[4849.84 --> 4851.84]  Did little more than echo the spirit of the period
[4852.84 --> 4854.84]  Buttressing the society that gave them their livelihood
[4857.84 --> 4859.84]  Now this is the point that Micah is making
[4859.84 --> 4860.84]  In the first two verses that we read
[4860.84 --> 4862.84]  In verse 6 and 7
[4863.84 --> 4864.84]  Right?
[4864.84 --> 4865.84]  When he says
[4865.84 --> 4866.84]  With what shall I come before the Lord
[4867.84 --> 4868.84]  And bow down before the exalted God
[4869.84 --> 4872.84]  He is putting us in the context of their situation
[4873.84 --> 4876.84]  And helping us to see that their approach to religion
[4877.84 --> 4878.84]  And their relationship to God
[4879.84 --> 4881.84]  To their covenant with him
[4882.84 --> 4884.84]  That's the word that we use for a special relationship to God
[4885.84 --> 4886.84]  Has been changed
[4886.84 --> 4889.84]  He's picking up on the ways that they have been using
[4890.84 --> 4892.84]  Or abusing that relationship
[4893.84 --> 4894.84]  They've made it about themselves
[4895.84 --> 4897.84]  Rather than about God's glory
[4898.84 --> 4901.84]  And so in their vending machine approach to God
[4902.84 --> 4904.84]  They make sacrifices in order to get something in return
[4905.84 --> 4906.84]  And so Micah says
[4907.84 --> 4908.84]  Shall I come before him with burnt offerings
[4909.84 --> 4910.84]  With calves a year old
[4911.84 --> 4912.84]  And to make the point he uses hyperbole
[4912.84 --> 4914.84]  So he exaggerates
[4915.84 --> 4916.84]  Right?
[4916.84 --> 4917.84]  He says
[4917.84 --> 4918.84]  Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams
[4919.84 --> 4920.84]  With ten thousand rivers of olive oil?
[4921.84 --> 4924.84]  The people have been thinking about their relationship to God
[4925.84 --> 4929.84]  From the perspective of what they can get out of it
[4930.84 --> 4933.84]  Now that kind of approach
[4934.84 --> 4937.84]  To church and to God and to faith
[4937.84 --> 4939.84]  Is really easy for all of us
[4940.84 --> 4941.84]  Right?
[4941.84 --> 4942.84]  It doesn't really matter how old you are
[4943.84 --> 4944.84]  Whether you are a Gems girl
[4944.84 --> 4945.84]  Or you're in your eighties
[4946.84 --> 4948.84]  Whether you are a preteen or a teenager
[4949.84 --> 4950.84]  Or you're in your forties
[4951.84 --> 4954.84]  And maybe this is especially true
[4955.84 --> 4956.84]  Right?
[4956.84 --> 4957.84]  When there's an injustice in your life
[4958.84 --> 4959.84]  Or when things seem unfair
[4960.84 --> 4961.84]  Right?
[4961.84 --> 4962.84]  Maybe there's someone
[4963.84 --> 4965.84]  Who, or a group of someones
[4965.84 --> 4966.84]  Right?
[4966.84 --> 4968.84]  Who make fun of you regularly
[4969.84 --> 4970.84]  Right?
[4970.84 --> 4971.84]  Who bully you
[4971.84 --> 4972.84]  And maybe
[4972.84 --> 4973.84]  When you go home and you pray
[4973.84 --> 4974.84]  You're like
[4974.84 --> 4976.84]  God, I do everything right
[4977.84 --> 4978.84]  Right?
[4978.84 --> 4979.84]  I don't say anything mean back to them
[4980.84 --> 4981.84]  I do good
[4982.84 --> 4983.84]  I help out
[4983.84 --> 4984.84]  With other people
[4984.84 --> 4985.84]  I go to church
[4985.84 --> 4986.84]  I go to Gems every other week
[4987.84 --> 4988.84]  Why would you let this happen to me?
[4990.84 --> 4991.84]  And that's the language of bargain
[4991.84 --> 4995.84]  That's the language that Micah is addressing
[4996.84 --> 4998.84]  That's the language of a vending machine God
[5000.84 --> 5002.84]  And maybe, again, in another way
[5003.84 --> 5004.84]  Maybe when you really want something
[5005.84 --> 5007.84]  When you really want to go somewhere
[5008.84 --> 5009.84]  Let's say
[5010.84 --> 5011.84]  Maybe it's Disney or whomever
[5012.84 --> 5013.84]  Wherever
[5014.84 --> 5015.84]  Right?
[5015.84 --> 5016.84]  If you let me do this
[5016.84 --> 5018.84]  If you give this to me
[5018.84 --> 5020.84]  I'll give my life to you
[5021.84 --> 5022.84]  I'll do this for you
[5023.84 --> 5025.84]  If you let me go to Disney this weekend
[5026.84 --> 5027.84]  I'll make sure every weekend after this
[5028.84 --> 5029.84]  I volunteer in the nursery at church
[5030.84 --> 5032.84]  Or I do something really good for mom and dad
[5033.84 --> 5036.84]  Or I will make dinner for my grandpa or my grandma
[5037.84 --> 5039.84]  Again, that's an approach to God
[5039.84 --> 5041.84]  That offers payment to him
[5042.84 --> 5044.84]  For a blessing that he gives
[5045.84 --> 5046.84]  And now
[5047.84 --> 5050.84]  I'm aware that these first couple scenarios
[5051.84 --> 5052.84]  Are relatively inane
[5053.84 --> 5054.84]  They're maybe everyday
[5055.84 --> 5056.84]  But what if
[5057.84 --> 5058.84]  It's more serious?
[5060.84 --> 5061.84]  Right?
[5061.84 --> 5062.84]  Maybe in the quiet moments of your life
[5063.84 --> 5065.84]  Maybe in your bedroom at night
[5065.84 --> 5066.84]  You think to yourself
[5066.84 --> 5067.84]  God
[5068.84 --> 5069.84]  Why did you make me like this?
[5071.84 --> 5072.84]  This isn't fair
[5073.84 --> 5074.84]  Can't you fix it?
[5075.84 --> 5076.84]  Can't you change it?
[5076.84 --> 5077.84]  Can't you change me?
[5078.84 --> 5079.84]  Right? Maybe your prayer
[5080.84 --> 5081.84]  Or your wish
[5081.84 --> 5082.84]  Is that you could just be like everyone else
[5084.84 --> 5086.84]  But it's not what you feel, right?
[5087.84 --> 5088.84]  And you feel like God
[5088.84 --> 5089.84]  You should fix this
[5090.84 --> 5091.84]  Maybe you feel like God
[5091.84 --> 5092.84]  Should take it away from you
[5093.84 --> 5094.84]  And that all the pain and the hardship
[5094.84 --> 5095.84]  Should just be gone
[5096.84 --> 5098.84]  And that if he's such a good God
[5098.84 --> 5100.84]  Why wouldn't he do that?
[5104.84 --> 5105.84]  And then
[5106.84 --> 5108.84]  What happens if that's what we feel
[5109.84 --> 5110.84]  And that's what we pray
[5111.84 --> 5112.84]  And God doesn't do it?
[5113.84 --> 5114.84]  Right? If he doesn't meet our needs
[5115.84 --> 5118.84]  Or he doesn't function in response to our questions
[5119.84 --> 5123.84]  Or our asking if he doesn't do what we've put our vending machine dollar in for him to do
[5123.84 --> 5124.84]  Right?
[5124.84 --> 5126.84]  Then maybe you get angry
[5127.84 --> 5128.84]  Maybe you get upset
[5129.84 --> 5131.84]  Maybe you put down an ultimatum
[5131.84 --> 5132.84]  And you say
[5132.84 --> 5133.84]  God unless you do this
[5133.84 --> 5134.84]  I'm gonna leave
[5136.84 --> 5139.84]  Or maybe you decide to forget God
[5140.84 --> 5142.84]  And take matters into your own hands
[5143.84 --> 5144.84]  Whatever that's gonna look like
[5145.84 --> 5146.84]  In that situation
[5146.84 --> 5148.84]  And look
[5148.84 --> 5149.84]  Girls, especially this morning
[5150.84 --> 5151.84]  Like I want you to hear
[5152.84 --> 5155.84]  One of the most beautiful things about this GEMS program
[5156.84 --> 5158.84]  And what we illustrated by standing together before
[5159.84 --> 5161.84]  Is that you get put into relationships
[5162.84 --> 5165.84]  With women and other women in your life and in your church
[5166.84 --> 5168.84]  Right? That you get put into a relationship with older women
[5168.84 --> 5170.84]  Who know some of these things
[5170.84 --> 5171.84]  Who've experienced some of these things
[5172.84 --> 5175.84]  And who just really want to be with you in the midst of that
[5176.84 --> 5178.84]  I know that your counselors want to talk to you
[5179.84 --> 5180.84]  And they want to pray with you
[5180.84 --> 5182.84]  And they want to meet you wherever you are
[5183.84 --> 5184.84]  Right? Even those things that you don't feel like
[5185.84 --> 5187.84]  Maybe you can talk to mom or dad about
[5188.84 --> 5189.84]  They want to be there
[5189.84 --> 5190.84]  I know that that's true
[5191.84 --> 5194.84]  And this is true in the bigger church for all of us
[5194.84 --> 5196.84]  Right? That in our struggle
[5196.84 --> 5198.84]  In our hardships
[5199.84 --> 5200.84]  We are not alone
[5200.84 --> 5201.84]  We are never alone
[5202.84 --> 5204.84]  You never have to feel alone or forsaken
[5205.84 --> 5207.84]  Or when you feel alone or forsaken
[5208.84 --> 5210.84]  May I just say boldly and with clarity
[5211.84 --> 5212.84]  You are not
[5213.84 --> 5214.84]  Because we are here
[5216.84 --> 5217.84]  And that in our struggles
[5218.84 --> 5220.84]  Right? There are people who
[5221.84 --> 5223.84]  Who love you and who want to care for you
[5223.84 --> 5225.84]  There are people who
[5226.84 --> 5228.84]  Who want to walk through the valley of the shadow of death
[5229.84 --> 5230.84]  Like we just prayed
[5230.84 --> 5233.84]  Who want to live into the dark night of the soul with you
[5234.84 --> 5238.84]  People who, when our hearts and our eyes fail
[5239.84 --> 5240.84]  When our lives wander
[5241.84 --> 5242.84]  They want to bring us back to Jesus
[5242.84 --> 5243.84]  But
[5248.84 --> 5250.84]  And now hear me carefully
[5253.84 --> 5256.84]  This vending machine relationship to God
[5257.84 --> 5258.84]  Is not what he wants for you
[5259.84 --> 5262.84]  Right? Yes, God has designs for your life
[5263.84 --> 5266.84]  He has plans for you and he has hopes for you
[5267.84 --> 5269.84]  Right? He has gifts to give each one of you
[5269.84 --> 5273.84]  And God does say that life with him is life abundant
[5274.84 --> 5278.84]  But we have to remember to let him define abundance
[5279.84 --> 5285.84]  Right? The truth is, of course, that every good and perfect gift comes from above
[5286.84 --> 5288.84]  The truth is that God hears our prayers
[5289.84 --> 5292.84]  And he responds and he acts in the world according to the prayers of his church
[5292.84 --> 5296.84]  Right? And I really do believe Jesus when he says
[5297.84 --> 5299.84]  Ask and it will be given to you
[5300.84 --> 5301.84]  Seek and you will find
[5302.84 --> 5304.84]  Knock and the door will be opened to you
[5305.84 --> 5307.84]  And I also believe that sometimes
[5308.84 --> 5309.84]  When we ask
[5310.84 --> 5312.84]  We don't actually know what it is we're asking for
[5313.84 --> 5316.84]  And I also believe that God has a far better view of the world
[5317.84 --> 5319.84]  Than you or I will ever have
[5319.84 --> 5323.84]  And so that what I actually need in any given moment
[5324.84 --> 5325.84]  I probably don't know
[5326.84 --> 5327.84]  But he does
[5328.84 --> 5333.84]  And so if he chooses to answer my prayer differently than I think he should
[5334.84 --> 5335.84]  I have to trust his wisdom
[5336.84 --> 5337.84]  And not rely on mine
[5338.84 --> 5340.84]  Right? I have to believe that if God doesn't give you what you want
[5340.84 --> 5342.84]  It's because he has something better
[5343.84 --> 5345.84]  Or he's already given you something better
[5346.84 --> 5349.84]  Or he's preparing you for something else that's yet to come
[5351.84 --> 5352.84]  And I get it
[5353.84 --> 5355.84]  Because that can be really hard
[5356.84 --> 5357.84]  And it can be confusing
[5358.84 --> 5360.84]  And none of it makes sense at times
[5361.84 --> 5364.84]  Truth, of course, is that
[5364.84 --> 5371.84]  Even though God has given us people like counselors and church families
[5372.84 --> 5374.84]  Truth is people will disappoint you
[5375.84 --> 5379.84]  And that parents will frustrate you
[5380.84 --> 5385.84]  And the truth, of course, is that in this world you will have trouble
[5385.84 --> 5394.84]  And while a relationship with God can sustain you through those troubled times
[5395.84 --> 5397.84]  And through those kinds of hardships
[5398.84 --> 5400.84]  While a relationship with church and with meaningful people
[5401.84 --> 5404.84]  Like counselors and friends and mentors can help you
[5405.84 --> 5409.84]  While a relationship with God will sustain you through those times of trouble
[5409.84 --> 5413.84]  A relationship with God will not stop those times from coming
[5414.84 --> 5421.84]  That's the problem that Micah wants to make sure we see that he is addressing his people through
[5422.84 --> 5426.84]  People who thought that they could use God to make life better
[5427.84 --> 5435.84]  Instead, I believe what God wants is for you to see how he uses us to make life better
[5435.84 --> 5439.84]  Right? The people try to use God to make life better for themselves
[5440.84 --> 5443.84]  God wants to use people to make life better for others
[5444.84 --> 5450.84]  That's what you guys get to focus on in act, love, walk
[5451.84 --> 5454.84]  He has shown you, O mortal, what is good
[5455.84 --> 5457.84]  What does the Lord require of you to act justly
[5458.84 --> 5462.84]  To love mercy and to walk humbly with your God
[5462.84 --> 5466.84]  The prophet Hosea makes a very similar point to all of this
[5467.84 --> 5470.84]  In a very similar circumstance that the people are facing
[5471.84 --> 5475.84]  Because, let's face it, we are thick and we struggle to see God as God
[5476.84 --> 5477.84]  And not as a vending machine
[5478.84 --> 5480.84]  And so many times we default in our relationship to God
[5481.84 --> 5482.84]  To manipulation rather than mercy
[5483.84 --> 5486.84]  And so Hosea says, for instance, in Hosea 6, 6
[5486.84 --> 5489.84]  For I desire mercy, not sacrifice
[5490.84 --> 5494.84]  And for acknowledgement of God rather than burnt offerings
[5495.84 --> 5497.84]  Right, hear this
[5498.84 --> 5501.84]  The rituals of prayer and worship and sacrifice
[5502.84 --> 5506.84]  Are all meaningless if they don't connect to life lived on the outside
[5507.84 --> 5508.84]  Every other day of the week
[5508.84 --> 5513.84]  If they don't transform your heart and your mind and what you do in the world
[5514.84 --> 5516.84]  These actions are pointless
[5517.84 --> 5520.84]  And that, I think, is behind the call of Micah
[5521.84 --> 5522.84]  To act, to love, and to walk
[5523.84 --> 5526.84]  And I think what he's doing is picking up on a theme
[5527.84 --> 5529.84]  That's first introduced to us
[5530.84 --> 5532.84]  In summary form, anyway, in Deuteronomy 6
[5532.84 --> 5535.84]  Deuteronomy 6, verse 5 says
[5535.84 --> 5537.84]  Love the Lord your God with all your heart
[5538.84 --> 5539.84]  And with all your soul
[5539.84 --> 5540.84]  And with all your strength
[5541.84 --> 5543.84]  Right, this is the command that Jesus
[5544.84 --> 5545.84]  In Matthew 22
[5546.84 --> 5547.84]  Calls the first and the greatest
[5548.84 --> 5552.84]  Right, it's the summary of the law in relationship to God
[5553.84 --> 5559.84]  And in both Deuteronomy 6 and Micah 6, verse 8
[5559.84 --> 5563.84]  God is asking for all of who you are
[5564.84 --> 5567.84]  For your will and for your desire and for your actions
[5568.84 --> 5571.84]  Right, he's asking for your heart to love mercy
[5571.84 --> 5572.84]  That's your desire
[5572.84 --> 5575.84]  He's asking for your soul, your mind to walk humbly
[5576.84 --> 5577.84]  That's your will
[5577.84 --> 5580.84]  And he's asking for your strength to act justly
[5581.84 --> 5582.84]  That's your action in the world
[5583.84 --> 5586.84]  All of who you are is brought into relationship
[5586.84 --> 5589.84]  With all of who he is
[5590.84 --> 5592.84]  Right, when we connect Micah 6, verse 8
[5593.84 --> 5594.84]  And Deuteronomy 6, 5
[5594.84 --> 5596.84]  We see that there is a straight line
[5597.84 --> 5600.84]  Right, to all of life being about worship
[5601.84 --> 5603.84]  To all of life being about our relationship to him
[5604.84 --> 5607.84]  That's what God wants in relationship with you
[5608.84 --> 5611.84]  Because he is most worthy of your worship
[5611.84 --> 5614.84]  He's more than just a vending machine
[5615.84 --> 5617.84]  He's the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords
[5618.84 --> 5621.84]  He is the Creator and the Sustainer and the Father of all
[5622.84 --> 5624.84]  And he invites you then to act justly
[5625.84 --> 5626.84]  And to love mercy
[5627.84 --> 5629.84]  He invites you to walk humbly with him
[5630.84 --> 5632.84]  In relationship with him
[5632.84 --> 5637.84]  But
[5638.84 --> 5639.84]  But
[5641.84 --> 5642.84]  But there is
[5643.84 --> 5644.84]  Another danger
[5647.84 --> 5648.84]  And the rest of you can listen in on this
[5649.84 --> 5650.84]  But it's not for you
[5651.84 --> 5653.84]  There is another danger
[5654.84 --> 5655.84]  Girls
[5656.84 --> 5657.84]  That you will hear
[5658.84 --> 5659.84]  The call
[5659.84 --> 5660.84]  To
[5660.84 --> 5661.84]  To
[5662.84 --> 5663.84]  Act justly
[5663.84 --> 5664.84]  And to love mercy
[5664.84 --> 5666.84]  And to walk humbly with your God
[5667.84 --> 5668.84]  And you will make it the same thing
[5669.84 --> 5671.84]  As that vending machine relationship to God
[5672.84 --> 5674.84]  Right, that you will say
[5675.84 --> 5677.84]  Unless I do exactly what God wants me to do
[5678.84 --> 5679.84]  He's not going to love me
[5680.84 --> 5683.84]  Right, unless I act justly in every situation
[5684.84 --> 5685.84]  With my brother or with my parents
[5686.84 --> 5687.84]  Or with my sister
[5687.84 --> 5688.84]  That he's not going to love me
[5688.84 --> 5690.84]  Right, unless I
[5691.84 --> 5692.84]  I love mercy
[5693.84 --> 5696.84]  And forgive them
[5697.84 --> 5698.84]  Right away when they do something wrong
[5699.84 --> 5700.84]  That God's not going to love me
[5701.84 --> 5703.84]  Right, unless I walk humbly
[5704.84 --> 5705.84]  That God's going to forget about me
[5706.84 --> 5708.84]  See, the danger with this text
[5709.84 --> 5711.84]  Is that we so easily just move from like
[5712.84 --> 5713.84]  The rituals of doing the right thing in worship
[5714.84 --> 5716.84]  To trying to do the right thing in life
[5716.84 --> 5717.84]  And then we hang our hat
[5717.84 --> 5719.84]  And our relationship with God on that
[5720.84 --> 5722.84]  But I have a question
[5723.84 --> 5727.84]  How many of you act justly all day, every day?
[5728.84 --> 5731.84]  Well, we got half a hand there
[5732.84 --> 5733.84]  Keep listening
[5734.84 --> 5736.84]  How many of you love mercy all day, every day?
[5737.84 --> 5741.84]  And how many of you walk humbly with God all day, every day?
[5742.84 --> 5743.84]  You might try
[5744.84 --> 5745.84]  And I pray that you do
[5745.84 --> 5746.84]  Because it's worth the effort
[5747.84 --> 5749.84]  But you and your relationship to God
[5750.84 --> 5752.84]  Is not based on the effort that you put in
[5753.84 --> 5755.84]  To act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly
[5756.84 --> 5758.84]  Because, and this is what I need you to hear this morning
[5759.84 --> 5761.84]  There is only one man in all of history
[5762.84 --> 5763.84]  Who did that perfectly
[5763.84 --> 5765.84]  Who acted justly
[5766.84 --> 5769.84]  Who acted justly, no matter what
[5770.84 --> 5773.84]  Who loved mercy in every circumstance
[5774.84 --> 5776.84]  And who walked humbly with God
[5777.84 --> 5778.84]  And his name is Jesus
[5779.84 --> 5783.84]  You see, Jesus does what we can't do
[5783.84 --> 5784.84]  Jesus does what we can't do
[5785.84 --> 5789.84]  And in so doing, he shows us a God who is just
[5790.84 --> 5791.84]  A God who is merciful
[5792.84 --> 5797.84]  And a God who is humbly reaching out to us
[5798.84 --> 5800.84]  In power, calling us to himself
[5801.84 --> 5802.84]  Jesus shows us what this is like
[5803.84 --> 5804.84]  And not only does he show us
[5805.84 --> 5808.84]  But he does it for you
[5808.84 --> 5809.84]  Right?
[5810.84 --> 5812.84]  What does the Lord require of you?
[5821.84 --> 5823.84]  I wasn't even expecting you to respond there
[5826.84 --> 5828.84]  He requires it of you
[5829.84 --> 5830.84]  But you can't do it
[5831.84 --> 5832.84]  You can't
[5833.84 --> 5835.84]  But thanks be to God
[5836.84 --> 5837.84]  Jesus did
[5839.84 --> 5841.84]  And so because he did
[5842.84 --> 5843.84]  No matter what
[5844.84 --> 5845.84]  No matter what
[5845.84 --> 5847.84]  No matter who, or how, or whatever it is that you face
[5848.84 --> 5849.84]  Because he did
[5851.84 --> 5852.84]  You cannot
[5853.84 --> 5854.84]  Fall
[5855.84 --> 5856.84]  You cannot
[5857.84 --> 5858.84]  Be forgotten
[5859.84 --> 5861.84]  You will not ever be let go
[5862.84 --> 5864.84]  That is the love of God
[5865.84 --> 5867.84]  Available to you in Christ Jesus our Lord
[5868.84 --> 5869.84]  Now there is nothing
[5869.84 --> 5870.84]  Nothing
[5870.84 --> 5871.84]  Nothing in all of the world
[5872.84 --> 5873.84]  Whether seen or unseen
[5874.84 --> 5878.84]  That can separate you from the love of God in Christ Jesus
[5879.84 --> 5882.84]  Girls everywhere meeting the Savior
[5883.84 --> 5886.84]  That is who we want you to see
[5887.84 --> 5888.84]  Jesus Christ
[5888.84 --> 5889.84]  And then
[5889.84 --> 5890.84]  Right?
[5890.84 --> 5891.84]  Once you see Jesus
[5891.84 --> 5896.84]  Once you know him and are known by him
[5897.84 --> 5900.84]  Then you get to walk with him
[5901.84 --> 5902.84]  Right?
[5902.84 --> 5903.84]  Then all of a sudden
[5904.84 --> 5905.84]  Acting justly becomes more realistic in your life
[5906.84 --> 5907.84]  Because he's given you the power to do it
[5908.84 --> 5909.84]  Then all of a sudden
[5909.84 --> 5911.84]  Loving mercy becomes more possible in your life
[5911.84 --> 5913.84]  Because he's given you the power to do it
[5913.84 --> 5914.84]  Right?
[5914.84 --> 5916.84]  Walking humbly with God becomes more regular and real
[5916.84 --> 5919.84]  Because he is sustaining you in that walk
[5920.84 --> 5926.84]  The danger is that it becomes about what we think we have to do
[5926.84 --> 5928.84]  The truth is
[5929.84 --> 5930.84]  He's already done it
[5931.84 --> 5933.84]  And so now we get to go with him
[5934.84 --> 5935.84]  In that work
[5936.84 --> 5937.84]  Amen girls?
[5938.84 --> 5939.84]  Amen girls?
[5940.84 --> 5941.84]  Amen church?
[5942.84 --> 5944.84]  Let's pray together
[5945.84 --> 5947.84]  Holy God
[5947.84 --> 5948.84]  Holy God
[5948.84 --> 5949.84]  We praise your name
[5950.84 --> 5951.84]  For who you are
[5951.84 --> 5955.84]  And for what you have done in Christ Jesus
[5957.84 --> 5961.84]  Lord Jesus we thank you that you have acted justly
[5962.84 --> 5965.84]  We thank you that you have loved mercy in our place
[5966.84 --> 5969.84]  We thank you that you show us and have done for us
[5970.84 --> 5972.84]  What it means to walk humbly with our God
[5972.84 --> 5976.84]  Not only do we look to you Lord Jesus as our example
[5977.84 --> 5982.84]  But we look to you as the author and perfecter of our faith
[5983.84 --> 5986.84]  We look to you as the one who has granted us a righteousness
[5987.84 --> 5990.84]  That comes from God through faith
[5991.84 --> 5992.84]  We look to you Lord Jesus
[5993.84 --> 5995.84]  And I pray, I pray for each one of these girls
[5996.84 --> 5999.84]  And for all the girls in this program
[5999.84 --> 6003.84]  That they would meet you, Savior
[6004.84 --> 6008.84]  Captivate their hearts with your love
[6009.84 --> 6012.84]  That they would rejoice in who you are
[6013.84 --> 6016.84]  In Jesus name we pray, Amen
[6016.84 --> 6017.84]  Amen
[6017.84 --> 6018.84]  Amen
[6018.84 --> 6034.84]  We are the of every song we could ever sing
[6034.84 --> 6045.74]  Worthy of every song we could ever sing
[6045.74 --> 6052.48]  Worthy of all the praise we could ever breathe
[6052.48 --> 6059.58]  Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
[6059.58 --> 6062.00]  We live for you
[6062.00 --> 6074.38]  Jesus, the name above every other name
[6074.38 --> 6081.24]  Jesus, the only one who could ever sing
[6081.24 --> 6088.00]  Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
[6088.00 --> 6089.98]  We live for you
[6089.98 --> 6093.98]  We live for you
[6093.98 --> 6101.46]  Holy, there is no one like you
[6101.46 --> 6105.04]  There is none beside you
[6105.04 --> 6110.00]  Open up my eyes in wonder
[6110.00 --> 6114.00]  And show me who you are
[6114.00 --> 6117.00]  And fill me with your heart
[6117.00 --> 6125.00]  And lead me in your love to those around me
[6125.00 --> 6136.48]  Jesus, the name above every other name
[6136.48 --> 6145.00]  Jesus, the only one who could ever sing
[6145.00 --> 6152.00]  Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
[6152.00 --> 6154.00]  We live for you
[6154.00 --> 6156.00]  We live for you
[6156.00 --> 6157.00]  We live for you
[6157.00 --> 6165.00]  Holy, there is no one like you
[6165.00 --> 6168.00]  There is none beside you
[6168.00 --> 6173.00]  Open up my eyes in wonder
[6173.00 --> 6177.00]  And show me who you are
[6177.00 --> 6181.00]  And fill me with your heart
[6181.00 --> 6188.00]  And lead me in your love to those around me
[6188.00 --> 6191.00]  And I will build you
[6191.00 --> 6193.00]  And I will build you
[6193.00 --> 6198.00]  My life upon your love
[6198.00 --> 6211.00]  And I will build my life upon your love
[6211.00 --> 6224.00]  And I will build my life upon your love
[6224.00 --> 6228.00]  It is a firm foundation
[6228.00 --> 6242.20]  And I will put my trust in you alone, and I will not be shaken.
[6242.20 --> 6250.16]  And I will build my life upon your love.
[6250.16 --> 6269.04]  It is a firm foundation, and I will put my trust in you alone, and I will not be shaken.
[6269.04 --> 6274.66]  And holy, there is no one like you.
[6275.16 --> 6278.40]  There is none beside you.
[6278.40 --> 6299.78]  Open up my eyes in wonder, and show me who you are, and fill me with your heart, and lead me in your love to those around me.
[6299.78 --> 6311.36]  As you go into this week, go with God.
[6311.62 --> 6320.40]  As you go, also go with an invitation to immediately following our gathered worship here to spend some time in the back in community and fellowship.
[6320.60 --> 6326.18]  Encourage you to introduce yourself to some of these girls and ask what they've been up to this year.
[6326.96 --> 6328.58]  There will be some refreshments available.
[6328.58 --> 6330.52]  I encourage you to stick around for that.
[6330.74 --> 6339.84]  As well, if you would like to pray with someone or connect with someone, there is someone at the back, and then who will move up to the front wearing a name tag like this with a big yellow square on it.
[6340.34 --> 6343.32]  They would love to connect with you for prayer as well.
[6343.38 --> 6346.86]  As you go, receive then the blessing of our God.
[6349.60 --> 6352.90]  May God go before you to prepare a way from you.
[6353.72 --> 6356.60]  May God go behind you to protect you.
[6356.60 --> 6363.12]  May God go beside you to befriend you.
[6363.58 --> 6365.54]  Do not be afraid.
[6366.20 --> 6368.18]  Let the blessing of God come upon you today.
[6368.34 --> 6370.10]  Do not be afraid.
[6370.84 --> 6375.58]  But go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
[6375.58 --> 6377.22]  Amen.
[6386.60 --> 6399.08]  You're the light of Judah, the Lamb who was slain.
[6399.08 --> 6403.00]  You ascended to heaven and evermore will reign.
[6403.00 --> 6407.10]  At the end of the age when the earth you reclaim.
[6407.10 --> 6411.02]  You will gather the nations before you.
[6411.02 --> 6418.32]  And the eyes of all men will be fixed on the Lamb who was crucified.
[6418.32 --> 6427.56]  With wisdom and mercy and justice you'll reign at your Father's side.
[6427.56 --> 6429.56]  And the angels will cry.
[6429.56 --> 6438.48]  Hail the Lamb who was slain for the world.
[6438.48 --> 6442.00]  Rolling in power.
[6442.00 --> 6446.00]  And the earth will reply.
[6446.00 --> 6450.00]  You shall reign.
[6450.00 --> 6457.30]  As the King of all kings and the Lord of all lords.
[6457.30 --> 6468.66]  There's a shield in our hand and a sword at our side.
[6468.86 --> 6472.42]  There's a fire in our spirits that cannot be denied.
[6472.82 --> 6476.62]  As the Father has told you for these you have died.
[6476.82 --> 6480.12]  For the nations who gather before you.
[6480.12 --> 6487.16]  And the ears of all men need to hear of the Lamb who was crucified.
[6487.16 --> 6496.16]  Who descended to hell yet was raised up to reign at his Father's side.
[6496.16 --> 6498.70]  And the angels will cry.
[6499.26 --> 6502.16]  Hail the Lamb.
[6504.50 --> 6506.72]  Who was slain for the world.
[6507.16 --> 6509.72]  Rolling in power.
[6510.12 --> 6514.60]  And the earth will reply.
[6514.60 --> 6519.60]  You shall reign.
[6519.60 --> 6524.42]  As the King of all kings and the Lord of all lords.
[6524.42 --> 6526.46]  And the angels will cry.
[6526.46 --> 6530.46]  Hail the Lamb.
[6530.46 --> 6534.36]  Who was slain for the world.
[6534.36 --> 6537.76]  Rolling in power.
[6537.76 --> 6542.24]  And the earth will reply.
[6542.24 --> 6547.24]  You shall reign.
[6547.24 --> 6552.08]  As the King of all kings and the Lord of all lords.
[6552.08 --> 6557.24]  As the King of all kings and the Lord of all lords.
[6557.24 --> 6559.68]  Who was slain for the Lord of all.
[6562.72 --> 6566.72]  Amzus gel.
[6566.72 --> 6596.70]  Thank you.
[6596.72 --> 6626.70]  Thank you.
[6626.72 --> 6656.70]  Thank you.
