[62.82 --> 82.98]  In the darkness, we were waiting
[82.98 --> 86.66]  Without hope, without glory
[86.66 --> 90.04]  Till from heaven you came running
[90.04 --> 93.76]  There was mercy in your eyes
[93.76 --> 97.38]  To fulfill the law and the promise
[97.38 --> 100.66]  To a virgin came the word

[157.12 --> 160.76]  You did not despise the cross
[160.76 --> 164.36]  For even in your suffering
[164.36 --> 167.82]  You sought to the other side
[167.82 --> 171.24]  Knowing this was our salvation

[217.58 --> 221.34]  All of heaven held its breath
[221.34 --> 224.58]  Till that stone was moved for good
[224.58 --> 228.38]  For the Lamb had conquered death
[228.38 --> 231.58]  And the dead rose from their tombs
[231.58 --> 234.90]  And the angels stood in awe
[234.90 --> 238.46]  For the souls of all who had come
[238.46 --> 241.94]  To the Father are restored
[241.94 --> 244.90]  And the church of Christ was born

[319.78 --> 321.62]  Thanks for joining us there
[321.62 --> 325.58]  Now, recognizing that everyone here
[325.58 --> 326.64]  Is a creature of habit
[326.64 --> 328.22]  And you sat where you would normally sit
[328.22 --> 329.46]  If we were meeting on Sunday
[329.46 --> 331.26]  That means the front here
[331.26 --> 333.98]  Is largely empty
[333.98 --> 336.24]  Now I'm not going to ask you to move
[336.24 --> 338.46]  I am going to ask you to sing loud
[338.46 --> 341.22]  Because the worship team wants to be able to hear
[341.22 --> 342.90]  That we are worshiping together
[342.90 --> 344.80]  And so project your voice
[344.80 --> 347.40]  So that we can still sing loud
[347.40 --> 349.38]  In praise of our God together
[349.38 --> 351.92]  I have no other announcements
[351.92 --> 352.90]  Other than to say
[352.90 --> 354.80]  We have worship tomorrow morning
[354.80 --> 357.30]  At our regularly scheduled Sunday time
[357.30 --> 358.46]  At 10 a.m.
[358.48 --> 362.24]  And so please hope to see all of you there
[362.24 --> 365.08]  Tomorrow morning as we worship again
[365.08 --> 366.72]  Can we stand together
[366.72 --> 369.34]  As we're ushered into God's presence
[369.34 --> 370.74]  As He greets us
[370.74 --> 372.34]  In worship
[372.34 --> 377.60]  Grace
[377.60 --> 379.32]  Mercy
[379.32 --> 381.18]  And peace to you
[381.18 --> 382.44]  From God our Father
[382.44 --> 384.14]  From the Lord Jesus Christ
[384.14 --> 384.76]  Son
[384.76 --> 385.98]  And our Savior
[385.98 --> 387.92]  Through the presence and power

[398.14 --> 400.28]  To join in that worship
[400.28 --> 401.46]  In spirit and in truth
[401.46 --> 404.38]  There may be a longer period
[404.38 --> 405.38]  Than we are used to
[405.38 --> 406.62]  Of being asked to stand
[406.62 --> 408.08]  And so if you need to sit
[408.08 --> 409.04]  At any point
[409.04 --> 409.78]  Sit
[409.78 --> 410.74]  Worship

[2563.54 --> 2568.26]  I know I'm filled to be empty
[2568.26 --> 2571.84]  To get the seed I've received
[2571.84 --> 2588.10]  What is our hope in life and death
[2588.10 --> 2592.38]  Christ alone, Christ alone
[2592.38 --> 2596.86]  What is our only confidence
[2596.86 --> 2602.02]  That our souls to Him belong
[2602.02 --> 2606.92]  Who holds our days within His hand
[2606.92 --> 2611.44]  What comes apart from His command
[2611.44 --> 2616.40]  And what will keep us to the end
[2616.40 --> 2621.96]  The love of Christ in which we stand
[2621.96 --> 2628.32]  Oh, sing hallelujah
[2628.32 --> 2633.06]  Our hope springs eternal
[2633.06 --> 2637.80]  Oh, sing hallelujah

[2668.60 --> 2669.40]  Year in pictures
[2669.40 --> 2671.96]  I believe Sarah Mullen can't put that together
[2671.96 --> 2674.50]  And maybe it's appropriate just to give her a round of applause
[2674.50 --> 2675.24]  Thank you, Sarah
[2675.24 --> 2680.66]  It's my pleasure right now to lead you in prayer
[2680.66 --> 2683.24]  So if you will, you'll please bow your heads with me
[2683.24 --> 2689.32]  Living God, in Psalm 98 we read
[2689.32 --> 2691.86]  How we are to sing to you a new song
[2691.86 --> 2694.30]  For you have done marvelous things
[2694.30 --> 2696.30]  Your right hand and your holy arm
[2696.30 --> 2698.16]  Have worked salvation for us all
[2698.16 --> 2700.38]  You have made your salvation known
[2700.38 --> 2702.50]  And revealed your righteousness to the nations
[2702.50 --> 2705.92]  You have remembered your love and faithfulness to Israel
[2705.92 --> 2709.10]  All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of you
[2709.10 --> 2710.64]  God our Father
[2710.64 --> 2715.10]  In our church this past year, Lord
[2715.10 --> 2717.52]  We have seen many marvelous things that you have done
[2717.52 --> 2720.18]  We just saw pictures from this past year
[2720.18 --> 2723.26]  Ministries to all sorts of people in this church
[2723.26 --> 2725.46]  To children, to students, to adults
[2725.46 --> 2726.50]  Both young and old
[2726.50 --> 2730.66]  We saw baptisms of babies
[2730.66 --> 2731.82]  Professions of faith
[2731.82 --> 2734.68]  Weddings, birthdays, celebrations of all kinds
[2734.68 --> 2737.10]  We've heard of the work done in your name
[2737.10 --> 2738.06]  By our ministries
[2738.06 --> 2740.56]  By the deacons and the elders of this church
[2740.56 --> 2741.44]  By council
[2741.44 --> 2744.52]  By the many agencies that we give to financially
[2744.52 --> 2746.70]  Within our denomination and our community
[2746.70 --> 2750.18]  We thank you for the work done to help those in need
[2750.18 --> 2752.76]  When weather strikes or war breaks out
[2752.76 --> 2753.98]  Or poverty takes hold
[2753.98 --> 2756.14]  We give your name glory
[2756.14 --> 2758.00]  When we can enter into people's homes
[2758.00 --> 2760.60]  And offer your hope when grief is present
[2760.60 --> 2762.96]  Or when loss is pulling us down
[2762.96 --> 2764.20]  Or pain runs deep
[2764.20 --> 2766.20]  Through all of that work
[2766.20 --> 2768.36]  You have been faithful, Lord
[2768.36 --> 2771.62]  And in our joys and our sorrows this past year
[2771.62 --> 2774.72]  Your salvation has been made known to us all
[2774.72 --> 2777.58]  Psalm 98 continues, Lord
[2777.58 --> 2779.58]  And challenges us by saying
[2779.58 --> 2781.42]  Shout for joy to the Lord
[2781.42 --> 2782.26]  All the earth
[2782.26 --> 2784.04]  Burst into jubilant song
[2784.04 --> 2785.14]  With music
[2785.14 --> 2786.68]  Make music to the Lord
[2786.68 --> 2787.26]  With harp
[2787.26 --> 2789.64]  With the harp and the sound of singing
[2789.64 --> 2790.86]  With trumpets
[2790.86 --> 2792.52]  And the blast of a ram's horn
[2792.52 --> 2793.82]  Shout for joy
[2793.82 --> 2794.64]  Before the Lord
[2794.64 --> 2795.12]  The King
[2795.12 --> 2798.52]  We love to praise your name here
[2798.52 --> 2799.16]  Lord Jesus
[2799.16 --> 2801.90]  Through our singing and worship services
[2801.90 --> 2803.28]  And choirs at Christmas
[2803.28 --> 2804.90]  And worship nights with teenagers
[2804.90 --> 2806.18]  Around a fire in the summer
[2806.18 --> 2807.64]  We are so glad
[2807.64 --> 2809.50]  That we can come to you regularly
[2809.50 --> 2811.86]  And lift up our voices to you
[2811.86 --> 2814.78]  Thank you for the gifts of so many in our church
[2814.78 --> 2816.88]  For those who play and sing
[2816.88 --> 2819.42]  For those who run tech and social media
[2819.42 --> 2821.32]  Those who plan schedules
[2821.32 --> 2822.58]  Those who teach
[2822.58 --> 2825.48]  Those who offer their time to watch our little ones
[2825.48 --> 2827.46]  So that parents can praise your name
[2827.46 --> 2829.48]  And that we can collectively worship
[2829.48 --> 2832.02]  We thank you for the many in this church
[2832.02 --> 2833.54]  Who serve you
[2833.54 --> 2835.78]  So that we may all worship you together
[2835.78 --> 2838.56]  We thank you for the staff
[2838.56 --> 2840.50]  No matter if they are newly hired
[2840.50 --> 2841.64]  Or recently retired
[2841.64 --> 2843.34]  Who serve this church well
[2843.34 --> 2845.16]  And seek you in the work that they do
[2845.16 --> 2847.74]  And God we pray
[2847.74 --> 2850.24]  Even in a year where we've dealt with
[2850.24 --> 2851.34]  Pandemic restrictions
[2851.34 --> 2852.76]  And economic hardships
[2852.76 --> 2854.40]  In a year where we grieve
[2854.40 --> 2856.64]  With the many who lost loved ones
[2856.64 --> 2859.68]  And in a year where all sorts of news
[2859.68 --> 2861.86]  Caused us to feel all sorts of uneasy
[2861.86 --> 2863.30]  About life in this world
[2863.30 --> 2865.00]  We know
[2865.00 --> 2866.52]  In and through it all
[2866.52 --> 2868.82]  That we can shout for joy
[2868.82 --> 2870.02]  To you our King
[2870.02 --> 2873.16]  Psalm 98 concludes
[2873.16 --> 2874.98]  Let the sea resound
[2874.98 --> 2876.52]  And everything in it
[2876.52 --> 2878.06]  The world and all who live in it
[2878.06 --> 2879.92]  Let the rivers clap their hands
[2879.92 --> 2881.94]  Let the mountains sing together for joy
[2881.94 --> 2883.72]  Let them sing before the Lord
[2883.72 --> 2885.62]  For he comes to judge the earth
[2885.62 --> 2888.16]  He will judge the world in righteousness
[2888.16 --> 2890.88]  And the peoples with equity
[2890.88 --> 2894.76]  Lord as we have all just come
[2894.76 --> 2895.96]  Through the advent season
[2895.96 --> 2898.80]  We know that we do not merely remember
[2898.80 --> 2899.70]  Your first coming
[2899.70 --> 2901.54]  That glorious night in Bethlehem
[2901.54 --> 2903.78]  But we wait with bated breath
[2903.78 --> 2904.68]  Your second coming
[2904.68 --> 2907.30]  Lord we thank you for this church
[2907.30 --> 2908.80]  And all that happens in it
[2908.80 --> 2911.14]  But we look forward to that day
[2911.14 --> 2912.92]  When all creation will bow down
[2912.92 --> 2914.86]  When the rivers will clap
[2914.86 --> 2916.22]  And the mountains will sing
[2916.22 --> 2918.54]  And you will reign over all things forever
[2918.54 --> 2921.94]  As we turn the pages of our calendars
[2921.94 --> 2924.24]  From 2022 to 2023
[2924.24 --> 2927.48]  Lord Jesus may we remember that truth
[2927.48 --> 2929.24]  That no matter the year
[2929.24 --> 2930.70]  No matter the time
[2930.70 --> 2933.42]  No matter what is happening in our lives
[2933.42 --> 2935.14]  Or the lives of those whom we love
[2935.14 --> 2938.00]  May we remember that you are our King
[2938.00 --> 2940.00]  You love us dearly
[2940.00 --> 2941.52]  And you will come again
[2941.52 --> 2942.64]  To be with us forever
[2942.64 --> 2944.88]  We pray this in your Son's
[2944.88 --> 2946.34]  Precious and holy name
[2946.34 --> 2947.22]  Amen
[2947.22 --> 2972.22]  A bunch of years ago
[2972.22 --> 2976.52]  I preached a New Year's Eve service
[2976.52 --> 2978.30]  A gentleman came up to me
[2978.30 --> 2978.98]  After the service
[2978.98 --> 2979.80]  And he said
[2979.80 --> 2980.62]  Pastor
[2980.62 --> 2982.48]  That was the best sermon
[2982.48 --> 2984.06]  I heard all year
[2984.06 --> 2986.42]  And I thought
[2986.42 --> 2986.90]  Man
[2986.90 --> 2988.82]  Like that's pretty good
[2988.82 --> 2989.56]  There's a standard
[2989.56 --> 2990.26]  I want to keep
[2990.26 --> 2991.26]  Going forward
[2991.26 --> 2992.42]  I want someone to say that to me
[2992.42 --> 2993.48]  Every New Year's Eve
[2993.48 --> 2994.96]  For the rest of my career
[2994.96 --> 2996.28]  I found out later
[2996.28 --> 2997.86]  That that was the only church service
[2997.86 --> 2998.90]  He went to all year long
[2998.90 --> 3006.20]  We gather at New Year's Eve
[3006.20 --> 3008.76]  To reflect on the year that was
[3008.76 --> 3013.78]  And to see where God has worked in the past
[3013.78 --> 3018.34]  And to begin to stretch our imaginations
[3018.34 --> 3021.24]  For where he might take us into the future
[3021.24 --> 3022.64]  This morning
[3022.64 --> 3024.30]  Or this evening rather
[3024.30 --> 3025.58]  We're going to do that
[3025.58 --> 3027.64]  By looking at a story
[3027.64 --> 3031.18]  From Numbers 13 and 14
[3031.18 --> 3033.26]  And we're not going to read that all together
[3033.26 --> 3036.02]  So you don't have to get ready
[3036.02 --> 3037.32]  Like I'm not going to start by reading it
[3037.32 --> 3037.84]  I should say
[3037.84 --> 3039.58]  I will sort of tell the story
[3039.58 --> 3040.32]  As we go through
[3040.32 --> 3041.16]  But if you have a Bible
[3041.16 --> 3043.72]  You can open it up to Numbers 13
[3043.72 --> 3046.64]  And we will look there
[3046.64 --> 3049.34]  Eventually as we go through
[3049.34 --> 3052.64]  Before we get to the story itself
[3052.64 --> 3057.34]  Let me introduce it with an analogy
[3057.34 --> 3060.58]  When I was a kid
[3060.58 --> 3063.72]  From like the moment I was born
[3063.72 --> 3065.00]  Up until I was a teenager
[3065.00 --> 3067.40]  Every summer my family would go camping
[3067.40 --> 3068.76]  At Kilbert Provincial Park
[3068.76 --> 3070.90]  Now Kilbert Provincial Park
[3070.90 --> 3072.96]  Is in Perry Sound on Georgian Bay
[3072.96 --> 3075.92]  Which is just off of Lake Huron
[3075.92 --> 3078.80]  In sort of central northern Ontario
[3078.80 --> 3079.90]  Kind of
[3079.90 --> 3082.52]  It's a beautiful park
[3082.52 --> 3085.54]  That is in the Canadian Shield
[3085.54 --> 3086.70]  Now the Canadian Shield
[3086.70 --> 3088.14]  Is a landmass
[3088.14 --> 3089.36]  Of sort of boreal forests
[3089.36 --> 3090.44]  Eastern white pines
[3090.44 --> 3091.14]  And rocks
[3091.14 --> 3092.62]  That were carved by glaciers
[3092.62 --> 3094.66]  However many thousands of years ago
[3094.66 --> 3095.50]  That was
[3095.50 --> 3096.66]  But because of that
[3096.66 --> 3098.32]  There's a particular point
[3098.32 --> 3099.20]  Kilbert Point
[3099.20 --> 3102.76]  That goes out into Georgian Bay
[3102.76 --> 3104.38]  That has a sheer cliff face
[3104.38 --> 3105.22]  On one side
[3105.22 --> 3107.26]  And then a soft rock face
[3107.26 --> 3108.22]  Down the other side
[3108.22 --> 3110.32]  And so people would go
[3110.32 --> 3113.26]  And go to the sheer cliff face
[3113.26 --> 3114.40]  And jump into the water
[3114.40 --> 3115.80]  And so you could jump in
[3115.80 --> 3117.70]  At like two feet of distance
[3117.70 --> 3118.68]  All the way up to like
[3118.68 --> 3120.26]  Fifty feet of distance
[3120.26 --> 3121.54]  If you climbed out of a tree
[3121.54 --> 3122.88]  And then jumped over top
[3122.88 --> 3123.66]  Of another ledge
[3123.66 --> 3125.76]  And it was awesome
[3125.76 --> 3126.92]  And as kids
[3126.92 --> 3129.30]  We used to love going to do it
[3129.30 --> 3131.82]  And every year
[3131.82 --> 3133.16]  We would try to move up
[3133.16 --> 3135.06]  To the next level
[3135.06 --> 3135.86]  Or height
[3135.86 --> 3137.36]  Of jumping
[3137.36 --> 3139.72]  Now when you're standing
[3139.72 --> 3141.78]  Forty-five feet above the water
[3141.78 --> 3143.38]  And you're looking down
[3143.38 --> 3144.76]  And you see a rock point
[3144.76 --> 3145.86]  That you have to jump over
[3145.86 --> 3146.60]  To get out
[3146.60 --> 3148.10]  What happens is
[3148.10 --> 3149.22]  You sort of hesitate
[3149.22 --> 3152.70]  And you start to wonder
[3152.70 --> 3154.18]  Can I make it?
[3154.72 --> 3156.28]  Is this a smart decision?
[3157.28 --> 3158.36]  Should I do this?
[3158.36 --> 3160.02]  And then the people around you
[3160.02 --> 3162.16]  Will say either
[3162.16 --> 3164.10]  Jump, jump, jump
[3164.10 --> 3165.18]  And the people in the water
[3165.18 --> 3165.98]  Waiting for you
[3165.98 --> 3166.56]  Will say
[3166.56 --> 3168.30]  Jump, jump, jump
[3168.30 --> 3168.96]  Or
[3168.96 --> 3171.50]  If they're your mom
[3171.50 --> 3172.46]  Who happened to come with you
[3172.46 --> 3172.98]  They would say
[3172.98 --> 3174.00]  No, I don't think
[3174.00 --> 3174.68]  You should do that
[3174.68 --> 3176.38]  Please don't do that
[3176.38 --> 3177.82]  Get away from the edge
[3177.82 --> 3181.82]  I share the story
[3181.82 --> 3183.38]  Because tonight
[3183.38 --> 3183.96]  As we look at
[3183.96 --> 3185.14]  Numbers 13
[3185.14 --> 3186.78]  We will pick up
[3186.78 --> 3187.82]  The story of Israel
[3187.82 --> 3189.82]  Standing on the precipice
[3189.82 --> 3191.68]  Of entering the promised land
[3191.68 --> 3194.86]  And there will be people
[3194.86 --> 3195.30]  Who say
[3195.30 --> 3196.84]  Go, jump, jump
[3196.84 --> 3198.00]  And there will be people
[3198.00 --> 3198.34]  Who say
[3198.34 --> 3200.32]  No, step back from the edge
[3200.32 --> 3201.44]  Don't do it
[3201.44 --> 3202.50]  The question is
[3202.50 --> 3204.82]  Who should we listen to?
[3206.28 --> 3207.20]  That's the question
[3207.20 --> 3208.20]  That faces the Israelites
[3208.20 --> 3210.58]  As we pick up this story
[3210.58 --> 3211.54]  Now
[3211.54 --> 3213.22]  Let me get you into the story
[3213.22 --> 3213.58]  For a minute
[3213.58 --> 3214.88]  We pick up the story
[3214.88 --> 3216.72]  The Israelites have left Egypt
[3216.72 --> 3217.44]  Okay, so that means
[3217.44 --> 3218.64]  The ten plagues have happened
[3218.64 --> 3220.48]  They've gone out
[3220.48 --> 3222.26]  They've crossed the Sea of Reeds
[3222.26 --> 3223.60]  The armies of Pharaohs
[3223.60 --> 3225.40]  Have been powerfully
[3225.40 --> 3227.28]  And miraculously defeated
[3227.28 --> 3228.46]  They have moved from there
[3228.46 --> 3229.44]  To Mount Sinai
[3229.44 --> 3231.24]  Where they dwelt with God
[3231.24 --> 3233.46]  They saw him on the mountaintop
[3233.46 --> 3234.38]  And Moses went up
[3234.38 --> 3235.80]  And he spent 40 days there
[3235.80 --> 3236.48]  And he came down
[3236.48 --> 3237.46]  And he radiated
[3237.46 --> 3238.96]  With the presence of God
[3238.96 --> 3241.42]  They have had a covenant ceremony
[3241.42 --> 3241.88]  Afterwards
[3241.88 --> 3243.72]  Where they confirm their faith in God
[3243.72 --> 3244.20]  Where they say
[3244.20 --> 3245.40]  Yes, you are our God
[3245.40 --> 3246.98]  And we will be your people
[3246.98 --> 3248.80]  We commit ourselves to live
[3248.80 --> 3250.68]  As you have called us to live
[3250.68 --> 3252.78]  And then in the excitement of that
[3252.78 --> 3255.10]  They have moved through the wilderness
[3255.10 --> 3257.22]  Kind of north and east
[3257.22 --> 3259.50]  If the traditional site of Sinai is accurate
[3259.50 --> 3263.70]  And come to the place that God had promised them
[3263.70 --> 3265.20]  Right?
[3265.28 --> 3267.44]  And the ten chapters that precede
[3267.44 --> 3269.62]  What we are going to read in Numbers 13
[3269.62 --> 3271.04]  Are full of excitement
[3271.04 --> 3272.20]  And optimism
[3272.20 --> 3273.36]  And wonder
[3273.36 --> 3274.96]  In fact, it's not unlike
[3274.96 --> 3276.34]  Walking from the campsite
[3276.34 --> 3277.24]  To that cliff face
[3277.24 --> 3278.14]  Where you're going to jump in
[3278.14 --> 3278.82]  Because you're excited
[3278.82 --> 3279.86]  And you're ready to go
[3279.86 --> 3280.70]  And you're a little nervous
[3280.70 --> 3281.72]  But you know it's going to be great
[3281.72 --> 3284.08]  And then you get there
[3284.08 --> 3285.88]  Numbers 13
[3285.88 --> 3288.02]  Where we pick up the story
[3288.02 --> 3289.42]  Is you have the Israelites
[3289.42 --> 3292.08]  Come to the edge of the land
[3292.08 --> 3295.44]  And that's where the grumbling
[3295.44 --> 3297.10]  Begins
[3297.10 --> 3300.46]  Even Miriam and Aaron
[3300.46 --> 3303.20]  Who are sort of influential leaders
[3303.20 --> 3304.70]  And confidants of Moses
[3304.70 --> 3306.90]  Even they begin to complain
[3306.90 --> 3308.94]  About Moses' leadership
[3308.94 --> 3311.20]  And as the people stand
[3311.20 --> 3312.98]  On the precipice of entering the land
[3312.98 --> 3314.56]  God tells Moses
[3314.56 --> 3316.64]  To send into the land
[3316.64 --> 3317.94]  Twelve what?
[3319.38 --> 3320.68]  Twelve spies
[3320.68 --> 3322.52]  Into the land
[3322.52 --> 3322.54]  Wrong
[3322.54 --> 3325.32]  It's not twelve spies
[3325.32 --> 3327.72]  That's the story
[3327.72 --> 3328.70]  We remember
[3328.70 --> 3330.10]  Maybe that's the Sunday school version
[3330.10 --> 3330.56]  You heard
[3330.56 --> 3331.80]  But actually
[3331.80 --> 3334.54]  Forty years later
[3334.54 --> 3336.66]  When they come back with
[3336.66 --> 3337.58]  Joshua
[3337.58 --> 3339.30]  Then two spies
[3339.30 --> 3341.70]  Are sent into the land
[3341.70 --> 3343.38]  Here
[3343.38 --> 3344.62]  It's not spies
[3344.62 --> 3345.50]  So
[3345.50 --> 3346.96]  Listen to this story
[3346.96 --> 3349.06]  Numbers
[3349.06 --> 3350.58]  Thirteen
[3350.58 --> 3352.54]  I'll start
[3352.54 --> 3353.82]  With just the first two verses
[3353.82 --> 3354.44]  As we
[3354.44 --> 3356.06]  Dive into it
[3356.06 --> 3361.02]  The Lord said to Moses
[3361.02 --> 3362.54]  Send some men
[3362.54 --> 3363.80]  To explore the land
[3363.80 --> 3364.34]  Of Canaan
[3364.34 --> 3365.22]  Which I am giving
[3365.22 --> 3366.04]  To the Israelites
[3366.04 --> 3368.32]  From each ancestral tribe
[3368.32 --> 3369.80]  Send one of its
[3369.80 --> 3371.44]  Leaders
[3371.44 --> 3375.14]  So when we read this story
[3375.14 --> 3376.16]  It's not spies
[3376.16 --> 3376.92]  It's
[3376.92 --> 3378.04]  Men
[3378.04 --> 3379.40]  Send from each tribe
[3379.40 --> 3380.54]  That second term
[3380.54 --> 3381.58]  Is really interesting
[3381.58 --> 3382.76]  Send one of the leaders
[3382.76 --> 3383.40]  In Hebrew
[3383.40 --> 3384.10]  The word is
[3384.10 --> 3384.56]  Rosh
[3384.56 --> 3385.58]  And it means
[3385.58 --> 3386.30]  Crown
[3386.30 --> 3387.04]  Or top
[3387.04 --> 3387.98]  It's
[3387.98 --> 3390.10]  Historically
[3390.10 --> 3390.50]  Literally
[3390.50 --> 3391.28]  It's used
[3391.28 --> 3392.14]  For the top
[3392.14 --> 3392.72]  Of a mountain
[3392.72 --> 3394.28]  In the context
[3394.28 --> 3395.46]  Of talking about people
[3395.46 --> 3396.72]  It means
[3396.72 --> 3397.74]  A leader
[3397.74 --> 3399.10]  Or a prince
[3399.10 --> 3400.70]  Okay
[3400.70 --> 3401.46]  So here's a couple
[3401.46 --> 3401.96]  Examples
[3401.96 --> 3402.30]  In
[3402.30 --> 3404.06]  In Numbers 25
[3404.06 --> 3405.10]  Verse 15
[3405.10 --> 3406.18]  It's translated
[3406.18 --> 3407.30]  Tribal chief
[3407.30 --> 3409.74]  In Joshua 24
[3409.74 --> 3411.02]  Joshua 24
[3411.02 --> 3411.96]  Is the covenant
[3411.96 --> 3412.88]  Renewal ceremony
[3412.88 --> 3413.78]  After the people
[3413.78 --> 3414.48]  Have all come
[3414.48 --> 3415.06]  Into the land
[3415.06 --> 3415.54]  So this is
[3415.54 --> 3416.54]  Generations
[3416.54 --> 3417.34]  Later
[3417.34 --> 3418.64]  We read
[3418.64 --> 3419.54]  Joshua summoned
[3419.54 --> 3420.32]  All the elders
[3420.32 --> 3421.18]  Rulers
[3421.18 --> 3422.24]  That word rulers
[3422.24 --> 3422.78]  Is head
[3422.78 --> 3423.28]  It's princes
[3423.28 --> 3423.68]  That's
[3423.68 --> 3424.10]  Rosh
[3424.10 --> 3425.36]  The leaders
[3425.36 --> 3425.88]  Judges
[3425.88 --> 3426.48]  And officials
[3426.48 --> 3427.08]  Of Israel
[3427.08 --> 3429.26]  In Chronicles 11
[3429.26 --> 3429.94]  Verse 6
[3429.94 --> 3430.58]  Rosh
[3430.58 --> 3431.48]  Is used
[3431.48 --> 3432.80]  To refer to
[3432.80 --> 3433.98]  The commander
[3433.98 --> 3434.90]  In chief
[3434.90 --> 3436.30]  Of David's army
[3436.30 --> 3438.96]  And so the men
[3438.96 --> 3439.60]  Who go in
[3439.60 --> 3440.86]  To explore the land
[3440.86 --> 3441.14]  Right
[3441.14 --> 3442.08]  We're not meant
[3442.08 --> 3442.66]  To see them
[3442.66 --> 3443.58]  As spies
[3443.58 --> 3444.80]  Skulking around

[4030.06 --> 4030.34]  I
[4030.34 --> 4030.48]  Don't
[4030.48 --> 4030.62]  Want
[4030.62 --> 4030.70]  To

[4034.26 --> 4034.62]  Imposed
[4034.62 --> 4034.90]  Upon
[4034.90 --> 4035.12]  Them
[4035.12 --> 4035.24]  And

[4036.06 --> 4036.36]  Down
[4036.36 --> 4036.50]  And
[4036.50 --> 4036.64]  That
[4036.64 --> 4036.86]  Made
[4036.86 --> 4036.96]  It
[4036.96 --> 4037.54]  Harder
[4037.54 --> 4037.70]  With

[4037.80 --> 4038.24]  Increased
[4038.24 --> 4039.04]  Difficulty
[4039.04 --> 4039.22]  I
[4039.22 --> 4039.46]  Don't

[4078.90 --> 4079.30]  Million
[4079.30 --> 4080.04]  People
[4080.04 --> 4080.30]  So

[4080.48 --> 4080.86]  It
[4080.86 --> 4081.02]  Was
[4081.02 --> 4081.62]  Slavery

[4088.60 --> 4089.06]  Also
[4089.06 --> 4090.88]  Here's
[4090.88 --> 4090.98]  Where
[4090.98 --> 4091.10]  We
[4091.10 --> 4091.24]  Can
[4091.24 --> 4091.70]  Relate
[4091.70 --> 4093.38]  The
