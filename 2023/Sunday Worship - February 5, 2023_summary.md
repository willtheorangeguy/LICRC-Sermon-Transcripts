• The current generation of twenty-somethings has discovered this universal ethic to be true, and it's a new way of seeing and being in the world.
• The universal ethic is often expressed through spirituality and magic, which can be more inclusive than traditional historical institutional religion.
• Ultimately, the universal ethic aims for absolute social tolerance and good behavior.

• Philippians 3 emphasizes that none of these things matter

• The phrase "first to the Jew, then to the Gentile" has two meanings: order and inclusion
• Inclusion means the gospel was always intended for the rest of the world, not just the Jews

• The gospel's message cuts both ways: it is for Gentiles and would be offensive to some Jews.
