[14.30 → 16.66] Like the roar of victory
[16.66 → 17.68] In a stadium
[17.68 → 19.78] Who can touch me?

[40.94 → 43.54] I've got a reason to fight
[43.54 → 46.60] Every day we choose
[46.60 → 48.56] We might win or lose
[48.56 → 51.34] This is the dangerous life
[51.34 → 53.82] Hey, hey, hey
[53.82 → 55.74] Every day when I wake
[55.74 → 56.96] They say that I'm gone
[56.96 → 58.06] They say that they've won
[58.06 → 59.80] It's over and die
[59.80 → 61.34] Hey, hey, hey
[61.34 → 63.34] When I need to be saved
[63.34 → 64.56] They're counting me out

[218.22 → 218.68] Invincible
[218.68 → 226.64] My heart bleeds adrenaline
[226.64 → 231.38] The fire I breathe is where I live
[231.38 → 235.18] Incredible and minimal
[235.18 → 239.40] One life to live, I never give up, I never give in
[239.40 → 243.10] Some people want to turn and run
[243.10 → 246.94] But the strong rise under the gun
[246.94 → 250.38] Top, to the top, ain't never going to stop
[250.38 → 254.82] To the top, to the top, ain't never going to stop
[254.82 → 257.14] Never going to keep me down
[257.14 → 261.14] Still the one that's standing now
[261.14 → 266.08] Destiny is calling me, you're down in history
[266.08 → 268.80] Every day I fight to be
[268.80 → 270.34] That you do me
[270.34 → 281.42] Fly high or will I fall
[281.42 → 285.26] Legends made when faith is strong
[285.26 → 287.78] No time to bleed
[287.78 → 291.22] I'm conquering, I'm conquering, I'm alive
[291.22 → 293.66] I'll push through the pain, I'm up for the prize
[293.66 → 297.28] Some people want to turn and run
[297.28 → 301.22] But the strong rise under the gun
[301.22 → 304.56] Top, to the top, ain't never going to stop
[304.56 → 308.66] To the top, to the top, ain't never going to stop
[308.66 → 311.10] Never going to keep me down
[311.10 → 312.10] Never going to keep me

[316.60 → 317.10] Still the one that's standing now
[317.10 → 318.86] Destiny is calling me
[318.86 → 320.30] You're down in history
[320.30 → 323.02] Every day I fight to be
[323.02 → 326.10] Every day I fight to be
[326.10 → 330.78] Every day I fight to be
[330.78 → 346.92] I'm conquering, I'm conquering, I'm conquering
[346.92 → 350.36] Wings are made to fly, made to fly
[350.36 → 354.20] Fears are born to die, born to die
[354.20 → 358.10] Pushing through the pain, through the pain
[358.10 → 361.12] Pushing through, breaking through
[361.12 → 363.14] Whatever it takes, what I have to do
[363.14 → 365.06] Giving my all, giving all that I've got
[365.06 → 366.96] Will Never stop till I get to the top
[366.96 → 370.36] Top, to the top, ain't never going to stop
[370.36 → 374.80] To the top, to the top, ain't never going to stop
[374.80 → 377.16] Never going to keep me down
[377.16 → 378.54] Never going to keep me
[378.54 → 381.14] Still the one that's standing now
[381.14 → 384.60] Destiny is calling me

[386.08 → 388.84] Every day I fight to be
[388.84 → 390.22] You're down in history
[390.22 → 392.08] Never going to keep me
[392.08 → 393.82] Never going to keep me
[393.82 → 396.34] Still the one that's standing now
[396.34 → 400.08] Destiny is calling me
[400.08 → 401.56] You're down in history
[401.56 → 404.28] Every day I fight to be
[404.28 → 405.86] You're down in history
[405.86 → 413.82] You're down in history
[413.82 → 427.88] God, I fight to be
[430.96 → 431.72] You're down in history
[431.72 → 433.28] り域にさ Conceptual
[433.28 → 449.04] When I open my eyes, I can't believe it
[449.04 → 453.48] How the world can look so different than we were dreaming
[453.48 → 458.84] It's getting harder to say, I'm undefeated
[458.84 → 463.60] When the best my heart can hope for is breaking even
[463.60 → 468.02] Here and now, reaching out in my heart
[468.02 → 472.86] I don't know how, but I know I'm not alone
[472.86 → 479.58] I can face my darkest night, because I trust you with my life
[479.58 → 484.60] I'm not afraid for you, you're my refuge
[484.60 → 489.70] When there's heavy on my chest, you're the place I catch my breath
[489.70 → 494.74] You are the only one I hold on to
[494.74 → 499.50] Oh, because you are my refuge
[499.50 → 505.92] I know how this ends, I'm going to make it
[505.92 → 510.58] Your word is in my heart, none could ever take it
[510.58 → 516.22] Here and now, in the south, come and fill me with your power
[516.22 → 519.14] Let me know I'm not alone
[519.14 → 525.06] I can face my darkest night, because I trust you with my life
[525.06 → 530.16] I'm not afraid for you, you're my refuge
[530.16 → 535.16] When you set me on my chest, you're the place I catch my breath
[535.16 → 540.16] You are the only one I hold on to
[540.16 → 545.40] Every day in the darkest night, I trust you at all times
[545.40 → 550.32] I'm not afraid for you, you're my refuge
[550.32 → 555.42] And when I've got nothing left, you're the place I find my rest
[555.42 → 559.88] You are the only one that I run to
[559.88 → 565.00] Yes, you are my refuge
[565.00 → 569.48] You're my rest, you're my rock, you're my fortress
[569.48 → 575.12] You're my strength, you're my shield, and you're my defence
[575.12 → 580.08] Nothing can ever take me from you
[580.08 → 585.18] Nothing's ever going to take me from you
[585.18 → 590.82] I can face my darkest night, because I trust you with my life
[590.82 → 595.68] I'm not afraid for you, you're my refuge
[595.68 → 600.84] When you set me on my chest, you're the place I catch my breath
[600.84 → 605.36] You are the only one I hold on to
[605.36 → 611.10] Every day in the darkest night, I trust you at all times
[611.10 → 614.90] I'm not afraid for you, you're my refuge
[614.90 → 621.12] And when I've got nothing left, you're the place I find my rest
[621.12 → 625.14] You are the only one that I run to
[625.14 → 628.98] Good morning
[628.98 → 629.26] Good morning
[630.84 → 633.66] Welcome to worship
[633.66 → 635.70] Can you hear me okay?
[637.06 → 639.22] Some of you say no, some of you say yes
[639.22 → 644.04] Not coming through
[644.04 → 644.68] We're working
[644.68 → 647.32] Oh, sounds like we're getting something
[647.32 → 649.42] No?
[649.74 → 651.44] There, there we go
[651.44 → 652.02] Good morning!
[653.86 → 656.40] Welcome to church
[656.40 → 658.58] If you're visiting with us this morning
[658.58 → 661.08] Let me offer a special welcome to you
[661.08 → 661.92] My name is Chris
[661.92 → 664.64] I'm one of the pastors here
[664.64 → 668.26] And it's my privilege to be leading you
[668.26 → 671.06] Along with a few others in our worship this morning
[671.06 → 673.34] We have a special service as we're
[673.34 → 678.54] Graduating our grade four kids out of children's worship time
[678.54 → 683.42] Into the ordinary worshipping life of this church
[683.42 → 687.24] And so we're excited about that part of our service together
[687.24 → 691.66] Before we begin, there are a couple announcements to make
[691.66 → 694.64] And, so I'm going to get Emo to start making his way to the front
[694.64 → 696.08] He's going to jump on the mic for the
[696.08 → 698.20] For an announcement
[698.20 → 700.42] But I also just wanted to say that
[700.42 → 704.52] Pastors class has one more meeting after church today
[704.52 → 707.10] And so if you've been in pastors class
[707.10 → 708.58] We encourage you to stick around
[708.58 → 712.20] Following worship today for just under an hour
[712.20 → 714.38] As we'll conclude that time together
[714.38 → 719.12] Also, the reactivate conference
[719.12 → 720.64] Which is happening in September
[720.64 → 723.66] The sign-up for youth has gone out for that
[723.66 → 726.04] And so youth and parents of youth
[726.04 → 728.30] You've seen that somewhere probably
[728.30 → 731.54] Make sure you sign up your kids for that
[731.54 → 736.64] And lastly, as we're anticipating our summer schedule
[736.64 → 739.16] Beginning in regularity next week
[739.16 → 741.98] Our children's worship time changes
[741.98 → 743.96] From preschool to grade four
[743.96 → 747.20] To ages three through five
[747.20 → 749.00] Have a group that they can go
[749.00 → 751.18] But we need five more teachers
[751.18 → 753.20] Mostly for August
[753.20 → 755.74] And so if you're around in August
[755.74 → 758.00] We would love for you to sign up for that
[758.00 → 759.90] You can ask Amy if you have any questions
[759.90 → 762.08] She's at the children's worship time booth now
[762.08 → 763.32] But she would love to field that
[763.32 → 765.32] If you get the bulletin from us
[765.32 → 766.76] The e-bulletin that goes out
[766.76 → 769.84] There's also a link in there to sign up at that
[769.84 → 772.48] Emo, why don't you grab a mic
[772.48 → 780.06] Good morning
[780.06 → 784.06] As you've probably read in your e-bulletin for today
[784.06 → 788.68] You've noticed that we have another July food bank drive
[788.68 → 791.80] Starting on July 9th
[791.80 → 793.96] We'll be delivering the empty bags
[793.96 → 796.90] Into our Durbanville neighbourhood
[796.90 → 798.36] Like last year
[798.36 → 802.90] Then on Tuesday, July 15th
[802.90 → 804.06] We'll be
[804.06 → 807.56] All the bags will be returned to the church
[807.56 → 810.82] And we'll hold a pancake breakfast
[810.82 → 813.50] And have a bouncy castle
[813.50 → 816.40] And other children's and adult venues
[816.40 → 818.46] On that day
[818.46 → 822.00] In order to make that happen
[822.00 → 823.16] We need volunteers
[823.16 → 824.96] To come forward
[824.96 → 828.92] To set up
[828.92 → 831.52] We'll have volunteers for the set-up
[831.52 → 836.38] Which is between 7 a.m. and 9.30
[836.38 → 839.88] And then the takedown crew
[839.88 → 841.82] Will be from 9.30
[841.82 → 843.80] Till quarter after 11
[843.80 → 844.94] No, sorry
[844.94 → 846.26] Quarter to 12
[846.26 → 849.92] There are two sign up sheets
[849.92 → 851.10] In the foyer
[851.10 → 854.02] One for the set-up
[854.02 → 855.22] And one for the takedown
[855.22 → 858.04] And there are also
[858.04 → 860.04] Volunteer sheets
[860.04 → 864.12] E-sheets
[864.12 → 865.96] On the e-bulletin
[865.96 → 868.20] Under the food bank drive
[868.20 → 870.68] That you can sign up on as well
[870.68 → 874.80] If you're electronically smart
[874.80 → 877.62] I encourage you to participate
[877.62 → 879.92] In this cause
[879.92 → 883.56] In a Christ-like compassion
[883.56 → 885.04] For the poor in our community
[885.04 → 886.06] Thank you
[886.06 → 887.00] Have a great Sunday
[890.04 → 893.96] Mindful of the fact
[893.96 → 894.90] That even as we make
[894.90 → 895.62] These announcements
[895.62 → 896.54] We reference there
[896.54 → 897.42] The e-bulletin
[897.42 → 898.42] A couple of times
[898.42 → 899.46] Some of you may not know
[899.46 → 899.98] What that is
[899.98 → 901.10] And so
[901.10 → 902.10] Instead of getting
[902.10 → 903.40] A huge worship folder
[903.40 → 904.66] When you come to us on Sunday
[904.66 → 905.76] We email our
[905.76 → 906.68] An e-bulletin
[906.68 → 907.66] To people
[907.66 → 908.56] And so if you would like
[908.56 → 909.62] To receive that
[909.62 → 911.16] I encourage you to connect
[911.16 → 911.96] With the office
[911.96 → 913.48] You can get Maria there
[913.48 → 914.76] You can email
[914.76 → 915.56] Communications
[915.56 → 917.42] At licrc.ca
[917.42 → 918.50] And they will add you
[918.50 → 919.26] To that list
[919.26 → 919.90] If you have questions
[919.90 → 920.38] About that

[1725.98 → 1735.32] He also watches over me in such a way that not my hair can fall from my head without the will of my Father in heaven.
[1736.08 → 1739.98] In fact, all things must work together for my salvation.
[1739.98 → 1747.82] Because I belong to him, Christ by his Holy Spirit assures me of eternal life,
[1747.82 → 1753.90] and makes me wholeheartedly willing and ready from now on to live for him.

[2070.96 → 2072.96] In your heart, in our hearts
[2072.96 → 2075.96] So we pour out our praise

[2135.96 → 2160.76] I would love to invite a few grade four students over
[2160.76 → 2164.66] because today is the last day that these grade fours
[2164.66 → 2166.40] will be going to Children's Worship Time
[2166.40 → 2170.78] and so in essence, they're graduating out of the Children's Worship Time ministry
[2170.78 → 2181.14] so I would love to invite Zoe Hubert, Amara Hogawoning, Julia Klein-Gelt ink, Caleb Service, and Austin Nordau up to the front
[2181.14 → 2186.36] and Joel Brummell is also one of these grade four students
[2186.36 → 2187.12] but he's not here today
[2187.12 → 2188.72] so we'll remember Joel as well
[2188.72 → 2196.26] but these five lovely folks have been in Children's Worship Time for quite a while
[2196.26 → 2197.18] but today's the last day
[2197.18 → 2198.92] are we excited about that?
[2198.92 → 2200.92] are we sad about that?
[2200.92 → 2202.92] sad
[2202.92 → 2203.30] it's good to be sad
[2203.30 → 2206.30] that's good, that means it's been a good ministry for you, right?
[2206.30 → 2207.92] now I thought we should acknowledge them today
[2207.92 → 2209.92] so why don't we give them a round of applause
[2209.92 → 2215.94] now you five up here
[2215.94 → 2217.36] I want to show you something pretty cool
[2217.36 → 2220.28] when you were baptized as little kids
[2220.28 → 2222.48] the church promised to do a few things
[2222.48 → 2224.46] all of these people out there promised
[2224.46 → 2226.06] that they would pray for you
[2226.06 → 2227.46] that they would encourage you
[2227.46 → 2228.62] that they would lead you
[2228.62 → 2229.66] and that they would teach you
[2229.66 → 2233.54] and I want to now invite anybody in the church
[2233.54 → 2237.24] who has been a part of these five kids' lives
[2237.24 → 2238.48] in Children's Worship Time

[2400.78 → 2402.50] alright
[2402.50 → 2404.56] we can have a seat
[2404.56 → 2406.92] and it is time for the offering
[2406.92 → 2419.10] so the offering today is for Night Shift Ministries
[2419.10 → 2422.80] and Yap who is going to come up to finish off as a deacon
[2422.80 → 2423.88] because I am not a deacon
[2423.88 → 2426.06] asked if I could say a couple of things
[2426.06 → 2428.26] because I am one of the volunteers
[2428.26 → 2430.04] from our church
[2430.04 → 2431.58] as well as through Benchmark
[2431.58 → 2433.80] that serves here in Langley
[2433.80 → 2436.04] so Night Shift Ministries is based in Surrey
[2436.04 → 2437.56] and there has been a group from this community
[2437.56 → 2438.66] on their own
[2438.66 → 2440.88] who have gone for years to the Surrey campus
[2440.88 → 2442.80] and helped serve the hungry
[2442.80 → 2444.12] in that neighbourhood
[2444.12 → 2447.32] but for the last couple of years
[2447.32 → 2450.32] our church has been involved
[2450.32 → 2451.72] once every other month
[2451.72 → 2452.76] here in Langley
[2452.76 → 2454.14] right beside the Vineyard Church
[2454.14 → 2455.90] serving out of a food truck
[2455.90 → 2460.10] to anywhere from 40 to 80 people
[2460.10 → 2462.16] that might come out on a Wednesday night
[2462.16 → 2464.44] and so that's been really a blessing
[2464.44 → 2465.94] for those that have been involved
[2465.94 → 2467.64] it's obviously been a blessing
[2467.64 → 2469.28] for those that are being fed
[2469.28 → 2472.70] but we're needing some more volunteers
[2472.70 → 2475.06] because we're looking to up that to every month
[2475.06 → 2477.12] so every first Wednesday of the month
[2477.12 → 2479.14] to serve here in Langley
[2479.14 → 2481.54] the food is taken care of
[2481.54 → 2485.22] by those that are leading it
[2485.22 → 2487.34] so it's really just to show up
[2487.34 → 2488.04] and help serve
[2488.04 → 2489.88] it's not preparing the food
[2489.88 → 2493.30] and yeah it's a wonderful experience
[2493.30 → 2494.76] and so I really encourage you
[2494.76 → 2497.40] if you are interested in helping out in that way
[2497.40 → 2499.22] it's a real blessing
[2499.22 → 2500.92] it's not too early
[2500.92 → 2503.62] it's like 6.45 to 8.15
[2503.62 → 2505.92] on the first Wednesday of every month
[2505.92 → 2508.18] and there already are some
[2508.18 → 2509.06] but we need some more
[2509.06 → 2510.38] so if you are interested
[2510.38 → 2511.12] you can talk to me
[2511.12 → 2512.40] or you can talk to Susan Star
[2512.40 → 2514.58] who's really heading it up for our church
[2514.58 → 2517.04], and please come out
[2517.04 → 2517.62] it'd be great
[2517.62 → 2518.94] over to you
[2518.94 → 2522.80] thank you, Leslie
[2522.80 → 2525.04] next week's offering
[2525.04 → 2527.64] will be for Cascades Christian Counselling
[2527.64 → 2528.36] thank you
[2528.36 → 2543.00] to death
[2543.00 → 2555.04] to death

[2561.10 → 2564.56] is
[2564.56 → 2565.36] to the law
[2565.36 → 2565.52] the world
[2565.52 → 2566.74] has
[2566.82 → 2567.44] come out
[2567.44 → 2568.48] in the
[2568.48 → 2569.40] .
[2569.40 → 2569.88] the Nick
[2569.88 → 2570.68] is
[2572.80 → 2573.14] your
[2573.14 → 2574.16] is
[2574.16 → 2586.42] I will come, I will come, I will come, Lord, and lead to the blood, to the blood, to the poor and the poor.
[2586.42 → 2595.42] And let it be my hand, I will pray within your hands, I will come, I will close and be.
[2595.42 → 2620.40] Votes are yours, God, I will come, I will close and be You.
[2620.40 → 2646.40] is
[2650.40 → 2659.84] I want to live for you, the way you need me. I want to follow you.
[2661.84 → 2670.50] I want to live for you, the way you need me. I want to follow you.
[2670.50 → 2681.18] I want to live for you, the way you need me. I want to follow you.
[2682.54 → 2693.50] I will go, I will go, I will go, Lord, send me to the world, to the lost, to the poor and high.
[2693.50 → 2702.22] I want to take everything I am. I will wave within your hands. I will go, I will go, send me.
[2704.10 → 2713.36] I will go, I will go, send me. I will go, I will go, send me.
[2713.36 → 2725.60] And now I would love to invite all the kids forward who are heading to Children's Worship Time today.
[2725.74 → 2727.60] Come on up to the front.
[2727.60 → 2744.02] Good morning, everyone.
[2747.52 → 2748.44] Good morning.
[2748.82 → 2750.48] Good morning, everyone.
[2751.12 → 2752.86] Good morning, how's it going to happen?
[2752.92 → 2754.84] Let's try it in the church. Good morning, church.
[2755.12 → 2756.28] Good morning.
[2756.28 → 2759.62] See how loud they were? That was great.
[2759.70 → 2760.54] How are we doing today?
[2760.96 → 2762.24] Are we liking summer?
[2762.64 → 2764.66] Who here still has a little bit of school left?
[2765.42 → 2766.82] Who here is done school?
[2767.64 → 2769.06] Oh, we are so close, hey?
[2769.84 → 2774.76] We are going to go to Children's Worship Time, but I do have a friend with me, but he's not here.
[2774.84 → 2775.56] Do you know where he is?
[2776.60 → 2778.56] We've got some...
[2778.56 → 2783.62] You know what? We've got teamwork happening today,
[2783.62 → 2786.38] so you guys say, come on out, Hank.
[2786.80 → 2787.88] Come on out, Hank.
[2788.88 → 2789.48] Here he comes.
[2790.30 → 2794.18] Hi, kids.
[2794.58 → 2795.44] Hi, kids.
[2795.44 → 2799.30] That is what teamwork looks like.
[2799.30 → 2800.30] Hank.
[2800.30 → 2803.14] We are going to talk about what it means to be a part of God's team.
[2803.56 → 2803.76] Yeah.
[2803.92 → 2804.90] We're going to do that today.
[2805.56 → 2807.10] And so I have a question for you, Hank.
[2807.28 → 2807.64] Mm-hmm.
[2808.14 → 2810.84] Have you ever been a part of a team?
[2811.32 → 2811.68] Yeah.
[2812.32 → 2813.64] Oh, I wonder what team he's been on.
[2813.64 → 2814.82] What team have you played for?
[2815.16 → 2817.52] A rock, paper, scissors team.
[2818.52 → 2820.06] Rock, paper, scissors team?
[2820.06 → 2821.00] I've never even heard that.
[2821.24 → 2822.62] It's very fun.
[2822.92 → 2824.42] How do you even do that, Hank?
[2824.78 → 2825.46] What do you mean?
[2825.94 → 2827.30] How do you do rock, paper, scissors?
[2827.82 → 2830.26] You make a rock or a paper or scissors,
[2830.62 → 2832.60] and then if you win, you win.
[2832.60 → 2834.66] We're going to do this.
[2835.66 → 2838.78] Why don't I play against Malachi quick?
[2838.84 → 2839.28] Are you ready?
[2839.52 → 2840.00] Yes, Malachi.
[2840.38 → 2840.92] Right here.
[2841.54 → 2842.40] One, two, three.
[2842.72 → 2843.88] Rock, paper, scissors.
[2844.06 → 2844.32] Shoot.
[2844.96 → 2845.58] I win.
[2845.98 → 2848.76] I'm very good at rock, paper, scissors.
[2849.90 → 2851.74] He just does rock all the time.
[2851.74 → 2854.12] No one ever expects rock.
[2855.72 → 2857.32] And so you're going to try another round?
[2857.68 → 2859.70] I don't think he's going to beat you.
[2860.28 → 2861.74] One, two, three, shoot.
[2862.66 → 2864.12] Oh, rats.
[2864.88 → 2865.98] Malachi beat me.
[2866.32 → 2870.68] So we are going to talk about what it means to get invited to be on a team
[2870.68 → 2872.98] or to be a part of a group of people,
[2873.58 → 2877.22] and that God has invited us to be a part of his team.
[2877.28 → 2880.10] He's chosen us, and we're going to talk about that today in Children's Worship Time.
[2880.14 → 2880.62] That sound good?
[2880.62 → 2881.68] Does that sound good?
[2882.04 → 2882.40] Yeah.
[2882.66 → 2882.96] All right.
[2883.02 → 2885.04] Let's pray, and then we'll stand and do the blessing, okay?
[2886.20 → 2887.60] Dear God, thank you so much for this day.
[2887.68 → 2890.30] Thank you that we can learn more about you in this church.
[2890.62 → 2893.28] We pray for these kids as we go off to Children's Worship Time
[2893.28 → 2896.50] that you'll teach us more about what it means to be a part of your body.
[2896.62 → 2899.26] And we pray for the church here, for all the adults who are staying behind.
[2899.64 → 2901.22] God, we pray that they will learn the same.
[2901.46 → 2902.52] We pray this in your name.
[2903.04 → 2903.32] Amen.
[2903.32 → 2903.80] Amen.
[2903.94 → 2904.14] All right.
[2904.18 → 2908.92] Let's stand up, and let's do the blessing together.
[2909.02 → 2909.48] Are you ready?
[2910.66 → 2913.00] The Lord be with you.
[2913.24 → 2914.90] And also with you.
[2915.24 → 2915.68] All right.
[2915.68 → 2919.44] All right.
[2919.44 → 2921.16] Thank you.
[2921.32 → 2930.94] Thank you.
[2931.02 → 2931.98] Thank you.
[2931.98 → 2934.76] If you're not here.
[2935.76 → 2947.42] right
[2947.42 → 2962.48] no
[2964.76 → 2972.12] My name is John, a member of this church, and I would like to lead you in our congregational prayer this morning.
[2974.16 → 2978.32] Before we come to the Lord in prayer, I want to mention a couple of things.
[2980.00 → 2986.28] This past Thursday, we had a congregational meeting here with dinner beforehand.
[2986.28 → 3000.74] It was a wonderful evening, I think a night that showed God's faithfulness to this church through our finances and serving in the various ministries that we have in this church.
[3002.20 → 3004.48] And we would like to say thank you.
[3004.78 → 3008.74] And also for those who helped prepare that evening, thank you also.
[3009.92 → 3016.18] We also heard about Reactivate, the youth program convention get-together this fall.
[3016.28 → 3025.74] Here in this church, and it was asked or mentioned that we volunteer ourselves to help coordinate and lead this.
[3026.38 → 3029.64] And we pray that that may happen.
[3030.28 → 3036.22] And also for night shift, we asked volunteers there also, and it's a wonderful program.
[3036.22 → 3047.34] We were also at Stafford, HD Stafford, in the last week, preparing to serve breakfast there to students this coming fall season.
[3047.96 → 3056.18] And so the Lord is opening doors for us, and we thank him for that, and we pray that we may respond.
[3056.98 → 3058.78] But shall we come to the Lord in prayer?
[3058.78 → 3071.54] Our Heavenly Father, we come before you this morning on this beautiful day.
[3071.54 → 3085.08] Lord, we wake up this morning, seeing the sun shine, and perhaps for many of us, the first thoughts that we have are how good you are to us,
[3085.14 → 3088.42] that we may see you in the brightness of the day.
[3090.32 → 3097.86] And Lord, we pray that even in the rain, when that comes also, still we may see your greatness and your majesty in that also.
[3097.86 → 3106.76] And Lord, we thank you that you have allowed us here this morning to come here to worship.
[3108.36 → 3115.08] We pray that we may do so in word and in song, in spirit and in truth.
[3117.58 → 3124.88] Lord, we pray that you would open our hearts to you, and that your spirit may move and live within us.
[3127.86 → 3134.04] Lord, you have knit each of us in our mother's womb.
[3136.32 → 3141.60] May we praise you, because we have each been wonderfully made.
[3141.60 → 3143.60] Lord, we pray that you would open our eyes.
[3143.60 → 3144.60] Lord, we pray that you would open our eyes.
[3144.60 → 3146.68] Lord, keep us close to you.
[3147.24 → 3158.30] And Lord, as we open our eyes also to the hills, Lord, may we see your greatness there.
[3158.42 → 3161.42] May we see you working within each of us.
[3161.42 → 3172.54] Lord, we thank you for the congregational meeting that we could have this past week.
[3173.94 → 3184.44] And Lord, as we shared the finances of this church, Lord, we thank you for the commitment that has been made here.
[3184.44 → 3193.54] Lord, we pray that we may joyfully share our first fruits with you and with others.
[3196.66 → 3205.16] And Lord, we pray that you would continue to lead us in all that we do.
[3205.16 → 3218.82] And Lord, as we talk about night shift, we pray that that ministry, too, may be a blessing, not only to those who are served meals, but also to those who serve.
[3219.94 → 3230.98] And Lord, as we begin the meal program at H.D. Stafford School this fall, we pray that there, too, the students who come may be blessed by the food,
[3230.98 → 3237.16] but also, Lord, may they see you at work in our lives and in their lives.
[3238.94 → 3241.14] We pray for Reactivate this fall.
[3242.44 → 3246.38] Lord, may we pray that, too, may be blessed by youth.
[3247.66 → 3251.80] We pray for many youths that they may want to come.
[3251.80 → 3261.70] And that through music and word and activities there also, Lord, may you be honoured and glorified.
[3261.84 → 3270.08] And we pray, Lord, that as a church, we, too, may be able to participate well in this and being able to lead and organize various programs.
[3270.08 → 3284.72] And Lord, as we see how richly we have been blessed, still, Lord, we see hurt.
[3287.10 → 3290.24] We see pain, Lord, in so many different ways.
[3290.24 → 3311.80] Lord, we pray for the Vandenberg and the Freeze families, Lord, as they grieve the passing away of Semi, Trudy's mom, Bill's mom, Lord, we pray that as they gather this afternoon for their memorial service, Lord, that you would give them strength and comfort.
[3315.70 → 3318.10] Lord, maybe there be peace there also.
[3320.24 → 3330.46] Lord, we pray for Ellen White as she, too, Lord, is thankful for all the visits and cards that she receives.
[3333.12 → 3347.14] From members of this church, Lord, as she's in the hospital for an extended period of time, Lord, we pray that you would give her strength to go through this and that she, too, may be thankful each day, Lord, that you bless her with.
[3347.14 → 3356.14] Lord, we pray for Micah and Jane as they prepare for their wedding day this July 7th.
[3356.76 → 3373.10] We pray for a blessing on the preparations and on the day itself, Lord, that as they commit their lives together, Lord, we pray that through your spirit, you may also be honoured in that relationship and in that marriage.
[3373.10 → 3375.10] Lord, we pray for Mini.
[3375.10 → 3376.10] Lord, we pray for Mini.
[3376.10 → 3377.10] Lord, we pray for Mini.
[3377.10 → 3380.10] Lord, we pray for Elise.
[3380.10 → 3382.10] We pray for Judy and Diane.
[3382.10 → 3386.10] Lord, for the elderly of this church.
[3386.10 → 3387.10] We pray for SAI.
[3387.10 → 3392.10] There are many, Lord, who struggle with some serious health concerns.
[3392.10 → 3397.10] We pray for each, Lord, that there may be healing of their bodies in miraculous ways.
[3397.10 → 3407.10] Lord, we pray that you would use us also to be with them, to build them up.
[3407.10 → 3415.10] Lord, we pray that you would be near to the families in this church, Lord, who struggle in other ways.
[3415.10 → 3430.10] So often, Lord, as we see each other, we all look so well, and yet we know that deep down, Lord, there are many who struggles with relationships, who struggle with their own spiritual walk, spiritual warfare.
[3430.10 → 3437.10] And, Lord, even though they may not be known to each of us, we pray for them.
[3437.10 → 3445.10] You know, Lord, who they are, and we ask that you would keep them in your care and that you would provide healing for them in miraculous ways also.
[3445.10 → 3450.10] Lord, we pray for the many now who also will be going on summer vacations.
[3450.10 → 3463.10] Lord, as programs slow down and give each of us perhaps some time away and time off, we pray that we may be able to relax well.
[3463.10 → 3468.10] And we pray, Lord, that you would protect and guide each one there also.
[3468.10 → 3475.10] We pray for the graduates, Lord, from schools, elementary, middle, high school, from college, university.
[3475.10 → 3483.10] Lord, we pray for those also who have graduated from the Sunday school program here that we witnessed this morning in the service.
[3483.10 → 3490.10] We pray for each of them that they too would continue to be led and guided by your spirit.
[3490.10 → 3504.10] And, Lord, we pray that as we continue to worship you this morning, may we do so again in spirit and in truth.
[3504.10 → 3508.10] May we open our ears, open our hearts to your word.
[3508.10 → 3510.10] May we hear the words that are spoken.
[3510.10 → 3518.10] We pray, Lord, for Chris that you would lead and guide him also that he may speak the words that you want him to speak.
[3518.10 → 3522.10] Lord, we thank you for being here.
[3522.10 → 3524.10] We pray this in your name.
[3524.10 → 3525.10] Amen.
[3525.10 → 3526.10] Amen.
[3534.10 → 3560.10] As you can see on the screen behind me, we're going to continue in our series through the Book of Romans.
[3560.10 → 3580.10] In fact, we're going to take a little break from Romans through the summer months as we transition to a different series on the heroes of faith, the examples of faith to us in the Bible and in our own lives for July and August.
[3580.10 → 3588.10] And so we're going to finish with Romans for this season.
[3588.10 → 3589.10] We will return.
[3589.10 → 3593.10] I promise my commitment is to make it all the way through the book with you together.
[3593.10 → 3597.10] But we're going to take a little break after this week.
[3597.10 → 3601.10] We are going to read together from Romans 8.
[3601.10 → 3605.10] We're going to read verses 31 through 39.
[3605.10 → 3614.10] If you have a Bible, whether it's in a book that you have to open and flip or on a device with you, I do encourage you to open that up or turn that on.
[3614.10 → 3621.10] Get that in front of you as we read the first time through, at least we will have it on the screen for you.
[3621.10 → 3625.10] And then you can refer to the one in your hands.
[3625.10 → 3628.10] With God's word open, let's read together.
[3628.10 → 3636.10] What then shall we say in response to these things?
[3636.10 → 3643.10] If God is for us, who can be against us?
[3643.10 → 3647.10] He who did not spare his own son, but gave him up for us all.
[3647.10 → 3654.10] How will he not also along with him graciously give us all things?
[3654.10 → 3659.10] Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen?
[3659.10 → 3662.10] It is God who justifies.
[3662.10 → 3665.10] Who then is the one who condemns?
[3665.10 → 3666.10] No one.
[3666.10 → 3678.10] Christ Jesus, who died more than that, who was raised to life, is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us.
[3678.10 → 3684.10] Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
[3684.10 → 3693.10] Who shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?
[3693.10 → 3698.10] As it is written, for your sake we face death all day long.
[3698.10 → 3701.10] We are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.
[3701.10 → 3702.10] No.
[3702.10 → 3703.10] No.
[3703.10 → 3710.10] In all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.
[3710.10 → 3731.10] For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[3731.10 → 3732.10] This is the word of God.
[3732.10 → 3734.10] This is the word of God.
[3734.10 → 3735.10] This is the word of God.
[3735.10 → 3736.10] This is the word of God.
[3736.10 → 3737.10] This is the word of God.
[3737.10 → 3738.10] This is the word of God.
[3738.10 → 3755.10] Now, I've said it a number of times as we've been spending these last four weeks or so in Romans 8, that this is one of those texts that just speaks, that just preaches, that just proclaims.
[3755.10 → 3783.10] And it's also, or it has become, one of those texts that sometimes we just hear, and we miss the import of, or sometimes that, you know, well-meaning Christians, counsellors, brothers and sisters have quoted to us in the midst of our struggles, and it just sounds impossible.
[3783.10 → 3784.10] Right?
[3784.10 → 3789.10] If God is for us, who can be against us?
[3789.10 → 3792.10] Sometimes that rings hollow.
[3792.10 → 3793.10] Right?
[3793.10 → 3798.10] Sometimes it sounds kind of like the word is Christians, right?
[3798.10 → 3804.10] Like the way that Christians talk to each other, and it doesn't seem very genuine or authentic.
[3804.10 → 3805.10] Right?
[3805.10 → 3813.10] Sometimes you can see it pictured this way and perhaps more so in like sports movies from the 90s.
[3813.10 → 3814.10] Right?
[3814.10 → 3820.10] Where you have a Texan football team in one locker room, and they're praying to God together.
[3820.10 → 3825.10] And then you have the other football team in the other locker room, and they're praying to God as well.
[3825.10 → 3828.10] And both of them are saying, if God is for us, who could be against us?
[3828.10 → 3832.10] Well, who, which one is God for?
[3832.10 → 3834.10] Someone's going to lose.
[3834.10 → 3835.10] Right?
[3835.10 → 3852.10] In some ways we hear these things, and it can be hard, or it can sound disingenuous, or it can feel almost fake and like a platitude.
[3852.10 → 3864.10] And so it's been my prayer throughout this week in particular that we might make this come alive together in our hearing.
[3864.10 → 3866.10] Because of course, it's true, right?
[3866.10 → 3871.10] If God is for me, who can be against me?
[3871.10 → 3873.10] But how do I know that?
[3873.10 → 3875.10] How do I know that that's true?
[3875.10 → 3889.10] In a world where it seems impossible to know anything with conviction and sincerity, how can I know that God is really for me?
[3889.10 → 3894.10] And if God is for me, what does that mean for the rest of my life?
[3894.10 → 3899.10] These are the sorts of questions that I hope we can bring to bear.
[3899.10 → 3917.10] And hopefully, as we engage in this together, we are encouraged to enter into whatever trial or darkness or persecution or whatever struggle or whatever weirdness or whatever social impact our faith might have.
[3917.10 → 3924.10] But we are able to enter into that with a sense of confidence.
[3924.10 → 3936.10] Now, Paul immediately in this text, and it reads almost with a, I don't want to say sense of urgency, but there's a pacing to it that just builds and builds and builds.
[3936.10 → 3944.10] And Paul immediately starts stacking layers of answers to these questions on top of each other.
[3944.10 → 3950.10] And he builds pretty quickly through this text, starting in verse 23.
[3950.10 → 3954.10] So the question is, if God is for us, who can be against us?
[3954.10 → 3963.10] And he says, he did not spare his own son, but gave him up for us.
[3963.10 → 3966.10] How can we know that God is for us?
[3966.10 → 3979.10] Well, Jesus, God's son, while we were yet sinners, while we were still God's enemies, came into this world, and he lived for us, and he died for us.
[3979.10 → 3981.10] That's how much God is for you.
[3981.10 → 3984.10] And he gave himself up for you.
[3984.10 → 3991.10] He who knew no sin became sin so that you might become the righteousness of God.
[3991.10 → 3994.10] That's how much God is for you.
[3994.10 → 3995.10] And then Paul keeps stacking, right?
[3995.10 → 3997.10] He goes one level higher, right?
[3997.10 → 4002.10] He says, if God is for me, who can bring a charge against me?
[4002.10 → 4004.10] And the answer there is no one, right?
[4004.10 → 4009.10] God's not divided against himself, and it's God who justifies.
[4009.10 → 4011.10] And he keeps stacking.
[4011.10 → 4014.10] If God is for me, who is it that condemns me?
[4014.10 → 4016.10] Again, the answer, no one.
[4016.10 → 4017.10] No one, right?
[4017.10 → 4024.10] The one who might, that is Jesus, who is judge, is acting now as intercessor for you.
[4024.10 → 4027.10] He's the mediator defending you.
[4027.10 → 4041.10] And we've said this a couple of times in this series, but picture this whole stacking of images and questions together like a courtroom drama, right?
[4041.10 → 4046.10] That's the image that Paul has been using throughout the book of Romans.
[4046.10 → 4047.10] Right?
[4047.10 → 4058.10] God's wrath is there over sin and his judgment is right and righteous because of humanity's rejection of him, because of our rebellion against him.
[4058.10 → 4072.10] But for those whom God has sovereignly chosen, those whom by grace through faith are saved from just punishment, Jesus has moved from judge to justifier.
[4072.10 → 4073.10] Right?
[4073.10 → 4083.10] Jesus is both the defence attorney for you and me and simultaneously the one who's declared guilty in our place.
[4083.10 → 4088.10] Jesus died the death that we deserve.
[4088.10 → 4092.10] And more than that, though, he was raised to life.
[4092.10 → 4093.10] Right?
[4093.10 → 4094.10] That's what Paul is building here.
[4094.10 → 4101.10] Precisely because Jesus is God, precisely because he was innocent, death could not hold him.
[4101.10 → 4109.10] And while the penalty for sin has been paid in his dying, the grave could not keep him.
[4109.10 → 4112.10] And so he was raised to life.
[4112.10 → 4125.10] And this question then at the beginning, if God is for us, who can be against us, is stacking answers to this point.
[4125.10 → 4129.10] To say, if God is for us, who can be against us?
[4129.10 → 4130.10] There's no one.
[4130.10 → 4132.10] There's no one who can stand against us.
[4132.10 → 4137.10] There's no one left to bring a charge or to condemn us.
[4137.10 → 4145.10] And if you have the ears to hear it, that is reality defining.
[4145.10 → 4152.10] That is mind-blowing truth that changes the world.
[4152.10 → 4155.10] That's why I love the book of Romans.
[4155.10 → 4165.10] That's why, in particular, I love Romans 8 and why it's so powerful.
[4165.10 → 4187.10] And yet, even as we read this, even as we sit in the relative security and comfort of these beautiful chairs in this beautiful sanctuary with a beautiful breeze blowing through every now and again, it's pretty easy to say at this moment.
[4187.10 → 4194.10] Even as our hearts are stirred by the beauty and the compelling power and purpose of it all.
[4194.10 → 4208.10] It is so easy to leave this place, to walk out these doors, and to live like it's not true.
[4208.10 → 4227.10] For instance, you might be sitting here thinking, or you might leave from here and hear again the devil's accusations, the deceiver's accusations.
[4227.10 → 4232.10] We might live like they have a certain power.
[4232.10 → 4237.10] And maybe, on an emotional and experiential level, they do.
[4237.10 → 4238.10] Right?
[4238.10 → 4248.10] I don't want to understate or minimize the way that emotions impact how we see and be in the world.
[4248.10 → 4251.10] And yet, it is so critical.
[4251.10 → 4265.10] And what Paul is driving us to here is to realize that spiritually and ontologically in the world, the devil has no real power to condemn you or to accuse you.
[4265.10 → 4268.10] Now, he tries.
[4268.10 → 4269.10] Right?
[4269.10 → 4271.10] It's in his nature.
[4271.10 → 4273.10] And so he must.
[4273.10 → 4280.10] And sometimes, I know, sometimes we listen.
[4280.10 → 4284.10] And sometimes we give him power to accuse.
[4284.10 → 4300.10] But very clearly, he doesn't have any, or at least he doesn't have enough to overcome the greater power of God and of Jesus and the victory of the cross.
[4300.10 → 4321.10] And now, in a very similar way, it's also really easy for us to go from this place and to live with your own accusations and your own self-condemnation as the voice in your own mind is often louder than the voice of God from the Bible.
[4321.10 → 4330.10] And in fact, this part here, this second category, where it's our own voice and our own mind is probably more true for many of us.
[4330.10 → 4340.54] And so instead of saying, if God is for us, who can be against us, we hear, or we ask, is God for us?
[4341.10 → 4345.10] Everyone is against us.
[4345.10 → 4354.36] Or in our own hearts, we think, I'm not going to ever be good enough for God and the world is against me.
[4354.48 → 4362.38] And sometimes it gets so bad, right, that we think, God is against me and no one is for me.
[4362.38 → 4382.64] Look, I know and understand how scary and terrifying it can be to live in that dark night of the soul.
[4382.64 → 4391.46] I know how scary it can be to feel that kind of deconstructionist of your faith happening in you and around you.
[4391.60 → 4399.32] And when your feelings are that big, it can be scary, and it can feel like you're walking through this life of faith as a zombie,
[4399.56 → 4405.88] not really engaging with the people around you, not really connecting in the ways that you want to in your head.
[4405.88 → 4413.34] And when you feel that way, it is so easy to hear the voice that says, you are fake.
[4413.94 → 4415.40] You are a fraud.
[4416.32 → 4418.58] There's no point in continuing on.
[4418.66 → 4420.22] There's no point in trying.
[4421.42 → 4425.94] And if that's you this morning, if that's what you are experiencing and feeling,
[4426.04 → 4430.92] or if you're feeling anything like this or anything similar to it, however it is that you would put it,
[4430.92 → 4440.06] can I just say that there is no safer place, there is no better place for you to be than right here, right now,
[4440.24 → 4445.46] at this moment, in this church, with these Christians, these brothers and sisters, right,
[4445.50 → 4450.72] these fellow pilgrims on the journey of life and faith, on this journey of doubt and belief.
[4450.72 → 4454.70] Because truth is, right, and I'm first among you all, we're all frauds.
[4455.56 → 4457.82] We're all hypocrites, right?
[4457.82 → 4462.30] We all at some point or another struggle to believe, every one of us.
[4462.42 → 4467.90] And so if that is where you are, you are not alone.
[4470.48 → 4478.72] Whether it's the dark night of the soul, whether it's the crisis of deconstruction, you are not alone.
[4478.72 → 4484.06] And if you hear one thing from me this morning, let it be this.
[4484.06 → 4494.08] The confidence of Paul's profession here in Romans 8 is not the strength of his belief.
[4496.12 → 4502.48] The confidence of Paul's conviction is not the quality of his faith.
[4502.48 → 4518.02] Instead, the confidence of Paul's profession is the person of his God.
[4518.02 → 4525.16] Our confidence, our conviction doesn't come from knowing everything.
[4525.92 → 4528.70] It doesn't come from feeling the right things.
[4528.98 → 4532.32] It doesn't come from practicing the right rituals.
[4532.76 → 4536.42] It comes from the person of God.
[4537.54 → 4541.06] It comes from his being of transcendence.
[4541.06 → 4548.60] It comes from Jesus Christ, the Word who took on flesh and made his dwelling among us.
[4549.66 → 4551.10] You can have confidence.
[4551.38 → 4553.10] You can have strong convictions.
[4553.64 → 4560.22] You can have a secure faith because it is God who is for us.
[4560.22 → 4568.22] And if God is for us, who can be against us?
[4569.58 → 4573.70] If God is for us, who can bring any charge against us?
[4573.78 → 4577.80] If God is for us, who can condemn us?
[4579.16 → 4580.10] No one.
[4582.32 → 4585.20] That's the strength of your conviction.
[4585.90 → 4588.74] That's the truth of our Christian faith.
[4588.74 → 4596.22] And it's a truth that is true no matter what else may also be true in your life and circumstances.
[4597.72 → 4600.58] In fact, remember we're building here.
[4600.72 → 4601.58] We're layering on.
[4601.86 → 4603.00] It only gets better.
[4604.00 → 4605.34] Look at verse 34.
[4607.04 → 4608.16] Verse 34.
[4608.64 → 4611.36] Who then is the one who condemns?
[4611.48 → 4611.94] No one.
[4612.06 → 4613.36] Christ Jesus who died.
[4613.48 → 4615.10] More than that who was raised to life.
[4615.16 → 4615.66] And here it is.
[4615.66 → 4624.00] He is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us.
[4624.96 → 4630.02] He is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us.
[4630.10 → 4633.64] This is a description of Jesus' current reality.
[4634.16 → 4635.58] This is what he is doing.
[4636.38 → 4639.66] And after his life on earth, after his death and his resurrection,
[4639.66 → 4644.28] 40 days later, he ascended to the right hand of God the Father.
[4644.54 → 4648.66] That is to say that he has been given the name that is above every name.
[4648.72 → 4653.10] That at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow and tongue confess in heaven and on earth
[4653.10 → 4657.16] that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.
[4657.78 → 4665.46] And from the right hand of the Father, he is exercising his sovereign reign to the glory of God.
[4665.46 → 4671.26] And from there, he, along with the Father, sent the Holy Spirit.
[4672.42 → 4676.76] But his reign and his rule doesn't stop there.
[4677.38 → 4681.00] His action in the world doesn't stop there.
[4681.12 → 4685.94] His action in the world continues on behalf of you and me.
[4686.12 → 4691.28] He continues, as Paul says, as an intercessor for us.
[4691.28 → 4697.78] By the perfect life of obedience and his death on the cross in our place,
[4698.18 → 4700.60] Jesus Christ has removed condemnation.
[4700.76 → 4702.14] He's removed judgment.
[4702.74 → 4707.98] And now, as he sits at the right hand of the Father, he intercedes for us.
[4708.08 → 4710.32] He doesn't bring condemnation.
[4711.24 → 4713.52] He rains down intercession.
[4715.10 → 4720.72] Now, the verb that's used, to intercede, is spoken there in the present tense.
[4721.28 → 4731.62] And thus, it gives this idea of an action that is completed but continues into the future.
[4732.44 → 4736.28] It happened, it started in the past, but continues going forward.
[4736.66 → 4744.56] In another translation of the Bible, the ESV translation, it says there that he is indeed interceding for us.
[4744.66 → 4749.56] And that word indeed is used to convey immediacy but also continuance.
[4749.56 → 4759.56] And so, you might say in this part that he is also, even now and will ever be, interceding for us.
[4759.56 → 4764.00] And so, just hold that image of Jesus in your mind, right?
[4764.36 → 4770.38] Jesus who stood in the gap caused by sin between us and God, between us and our heavenly home.
[4770.80 → 4772.58] Jesus who made a way for us.
[4772.70 → 4775.90] He continues to stand in that gap.
[4776.04 → 4779.02] He continues to represent us to the Father.
[4779.14 → 4784.84] He continues to work in you and through you, transforming you by the renewing of your mind.
[4784.84 → 4791.66] In John 17, Jesus prayed for all his followers.
[4792.10 → 4793.20] And that means you and me.
[4793.20 → 4804.52] And in Romans 8, we learn that Jesus continues to pray, continues to intercede for his followers.
[4805.54 → 4810.82] Jesus, at the right hand of the Father, has the ear of the Father, even now.
[4810.92 → 4815.40] And what he does is he brings to the Father your prayers.
[4815.40 → 4821.80] And so, as you pray, Jesus hears your voice.
[4822.96 → 4825.68] And he speaks it to the Father.
[4826.26 → 4833.58] As you pray, the Spirit who came down lifts your prayers as if incense up to heaven.
[4833.86 → 4837.80] And Jesus hears and the Father responds.
[4837.80 → 4845.56] As you pray, the full activity of our triune God is going on at that moment.
[4847.34 → 4851.84] And so, does that not move us to pray?
[4853.58 → 4856.80] He hears your prayers, and he wants to hear more from you.
[4857.14 → 4862.72] And by our prayers, he moves us into step and line with the will of God.
[4862.72 → 4869.76] Using our prayers as the means of achieving his ultimate goal.
[4870.18 → 4870.26] Right?
[4870.30 → 4876.00] The revealing of his kingdom come and his kingdom coming for the glory of his name.
[4878.08 → 4878.20] Right?
[4878.30 → 4883.86] And here, if Jesus is in heaven interceding on our behalf,
[4884.26 → 4891.40] should we not also then be praying and interceding on behalf of those around him in our life as well?
[4891.40 → 4891.84] Right?
[4892.34 → 4897.76] Prayer and the word of God are the lifeblood of Christian faith.
[4898.14 → 4901.22] And as the word courses in you and through you,
[4901.30 → 4908.94] so prayers flow out of you in praise of his name and in intercession for his world.
[4908.94 → 4923.18] A number of years ago, I heard a story from the woman to whom this event happened.
[4923.18 → 4928.20] She was driving in her car down a Michigan highway,
[4929.02 → 4931.28] listening to the radio,
[4931.62 → 4934.72] when all of a sudden she heard a voice that told her,
[4936.18 → 4938.52] pull over at the next gas station,
[4939.36 → 4940.20] get out of the car,
[4940.80 → 4943.10] do a handstand in front of the pop machine,
[4943.74 → 4945.02] turn around and walk out.
[4945.02 → 4949.20] Now this woman, born and raised, Christian reformed.
[4950.26 → 4952.42] She thought she was going crazy.
[4954.18 → 4955.72] But the voice remained.
[4956.38 → 4957.68] The word remained.
[4957.68 → 4963.60] And so, as she spent the next three miles wrestling with what to do,
[4963.94 → 4964.92] she finally decided,
[4965.06 → 4967.42] okay, I'm going to turn it off.
[4967.82 → 4968.68] Gets off the highway.
[4969.18 → 4972.30] There's a gas station 0.3 miles away, says the sign.
[4973.14 → 4974.70] Pulls into the gas station,
[4975.46 → 4976.76] gets out, opens the door,
[4976.90 → 4979.26] sees the clerk behind the bulletproof glass.
[4979.36 → 4980.48] Remember, we're in Michigan here.
[4980.82 → 4981.72] Behind the counter,
[4982.52 → 4984.20] sees the pop machine in the other corner.
[4984.20 → 4986.44] walks over to the other corner,
[4986.98 → 4988.08] kneels down in front of it,
[4988.40 → 4989.40] does a handstand,
[4990.60 → 4991.98] laughs at herself,
[4992.84 → 4993.36] gets up,
[4993.92 → 4994.98] and walks out the door.
[4995.06 → 4996.34] When she puts her hand on the door,
[4996.46 → 4997.90] the clerk behind the counter says,
[4998.60 → 5001.30] who the H are you?
[5006.24 → 5007.32] My name is,
[5007.56 → 5008.40] she gave her name.
[5009.92 → 5012.28] Why on earth did you just do that?
[5012.28 → 5014.02] She's like,
[5014.08 → 5014.54] I don't know.
[5014.90 → 5016.16] I think I'm going crazy.
[5016.94 → 5017.90] But I was driving,
[5018.24 → 5019.20] and I heard a voice,
[5019.40 → 5021.22] and it told me that if I didn't pull over,
[5022.66 → 5024.08] and so I did it.
[5024.58 → 5025.22] I don't know.
[5025.36 → 5026.50] Do you need to call the police?
[5026.72 → 5028.02] Do you need to call an ambulance for me?
[5028.38 → 5030.84] And the person behind the counter said,
[5031.84 → 5033.28] three minutes ago,
[5033.66 → 5036.74] I picked up this gun behind the counter,
[5037.20 → 5038.52] and I prayed,
[5038.52 → 5040.02] God,
[5040.08 → 5040.80] if you are real,
[5041.54 → 5043.66] if you want to save my life,
[5044.50 → 5045.96] send someone in here,
[5046.08 → 5047.38] and make them do a handstand
[5047.38 → 5048.56] in front of the pop machine in the corner.
[5053.56 → 5054.00] You
[5054.00 → 5056.36] saved my life.
[5057.94 → 5058.88] And this woman,
[5059.14 → 5059.64] in tears,
[5059.78 → 5059.98] said,
[5060.06 → 5060.30] no,
[5060.90 → 5061.52] God did.
[5061.52 → 5066.66] Now,
[5066.70 → 5068.60] that seems like an incredible story,
[5069.34 → 5072.38] but I could stand up here,
[5072.94 → 5074.36] and for the next 30 minutes,
[5074.90 → 5076.64] tell you stories like this,
[5076.90 → 5078.24] from this community.
[5079.46 → 5082.14] Tell you stories of answered prayer,
[5082.38 → 5085.36] of God visibly and powerfully at work,
[5085.40 → 5087.02] whether it's in the midst of healing,
[5087.32 → 5088.52] whether it's in the face of death
[5088.52 → 5089.30] and bringing hope,
[5089.30 → 5091.20] whether it's in the midst of community,
[5091.40 → 5092.78] coming together and restoring
[5092.78 → 5093.54] and bringing,
[5093.98 → 5096.10] God hears our prayers
[5096.10 → 5099.62] and is at work in us and through us.
[5099.76 → 5101.58] This is what He does,
[5101.68 → 5103.28] and it's this kind of life
[5103.28 → 5105.42] that He invites us to.
[5108.00 → 5108.58] Now,
[5108.64 → 5109.80] we don't always get
[5109.80 → 5112.84] the answer we're looking for.
[5115.34 → 5116.86] God doesn't always
[5116.86 → 5118.76] bring someone into our lives
[5118.76 → 5119.40] to do a handstand
[5119.40 → 5120.38] in front of a pop machine,
[5121.38 → 5124.04] but He hears you,
[5124.56 → 5126.64] and He has given you
[5126.64 → 5127.72] the person beside you.
[5128.70 → 5129.64] He has given you
[5129.64 → 5130.60] the person in front of you.
[5130.68 → 5132.60] He has given you us
[5132.60 → 5135.10] to be that answer
[5135.10 → 5137.20] to your prayer.
[5138.96 → 5139.92] And I know,
[5140.38 → 5143.68] I know that you might not
[5143.68 → 5144.88] be at a place
[5144.88 → 5146.06] where you can believe that
[5146.06 → 5147.58] or where you can feel it.
[5151.58 → 5153.50] But if you,
[5153.80 → 5156.38] if you are walking
[5156.38 → 5158.38] in that place,
[5158.84 → 5160.18] hear this.
[5160.84 → 5163.02] God is still
[5163.02 → 5164.98] for us.
[5167.46 → 5168.72] Immediately following
[5168.72 → 5170.52] this statement, right,
[5170.74 → 5172.52] regarding the eternal intercession
[5172.52 → 5173.52] of Jesus,
[5173.78 → 5174.54] Paul says,
[5175.34 → 5176.06] so then,
[5176.24 → 5178.42] who shall separate us
[5178.42 → 5180.60] from the love of Christ?
[5181.48 → 5182.42] To which the answer
[5182.42 → 5183.40] is an emphatic,
[5183.88 → 5184.26] nothing,
[5184.90 → 5185.36] ever,
[5186.06 → 5186.58] anywhere.
[5187.58 → 5187.78] Right?
[5187.82 → 5188.40] It is true
[5188.40 → 5189.24] that Christ is
[5189.24 → 5190.12] at the right hand
[5190.12 → 5190.74] of God,
[5190.80 → 5191.88] but He is not there
[5191.88 → 5192.54] relaxing.
[5192.90 → 5193.74] He's not there
[5193.74 → 5195.16] unthinkingly passive.
[5195.36 → 5196.06] He's not there
[5196.06 → 5196.94] just waiting for
[5196.94 → 5198.14] the next assignment
[5198.14 → 5199.40] from the Father.
[5199.60 → 5200.34] He is there
[5200.34 → 5202.16] hearing our petitions,
[5202.56 → 5203.44] representing us
[5203.44 → 5204.00] to the Father,
[5204.14 → 5204.88] supporting us
[5204.88 → 5205.52] in trial,
[5205.64 → 5206.54] giving us courage
[5206.54 → 5207.88] in the face of death.
[5207.96 → 5208.46] He is there
[5208.46 → 5210.12] empowering us
[5210.12 → 5210.84] to oppose
[5210.84 → 5212.16] the forces of Satan.
[5212.48 → 5213.00] He is there
[5213.00 → 5213.84] enabling us
[5213.84 → 5214.44] to journey
[5214.44 → 5215.40] to the highest
[5215.40 → 5216.42] mountain of life
[5216.42 → 5217.04] or through
[5217.04 → 5218.58] the lowest valley
[5218.58 → 5221.14] because of His
[5221.14 → 5222.82] constant intercession.
[5223.26 → 5223.60] Nothing,
[5224.14 → 5225.62] not one thing
[5225.62 → 5227.80] is able to separate you
[5227.80 → 5229.68] from the love of God
[5229.68 → 5230.56] that is available
[5230.56 → 5232.58] in Christ Jesus.
[5234.50 → 5236.26] Who shall separate us
[5236.26 → 5237.66] from the love of Christ?
[5237.82 → 5238.38] Shall trouble
[5238.38 → 5239.20] or hardship
[5239.20 → 5240.08] or persecution
[5240.08 → 5240.84] or famine
[5240.84 → 5241.84] or nakedness
[5241.84 → 5242.44] or danger
[5242.44 → 5243.28] or sword?
[5244.18 → 5245.04] As it is written,
[5245.22 → 5246.14] for your sake
[5246.14 → 5247.02] we face death
[5247.02 → 5247.72] all day long.
[5247.82 → 5248.48] We are considered
[5248.48 → 5249.42] as sheep
[5249.42 → 5250.44] to be slaughtered.
[5250.70 → 5251.18] No.
[5253.24 → 5254.14] Can I just say
[5254.14 → 5256.10] that might be
[5256.10 → 5257.14] the most beautiful
[5257.14 → 5259.20] no in the entire Bible?
[5260.96 → 5261.42] Right?
[5261.46 → 5262.00] That might be
[5262.00 → 5263.20] the most beautiful
[5263.20 → 5264.80] no you will ever hear.
[5265.96 → 5267.24] And who shall separate us
[5267.24 → 5268.14] from the love of Christ?
[5268.36 → 5268.64] No.
[5269.24 → 5269.88] Shall trouble?
[5270.18 → 5270.46] No.
[5270.62 → 5271.16] Shall hardship?
[5271.56 → 5271.88] No.
[5272.08 → 5272.72] Shall persecution?
[5273.12 → 5273.40] No.
[5273.58 → 5274.12] Shall famine?
[5274.44 → 5274.70] No.
[5274.84 → 5275.50] Shall nakedness?
[5275.72 → 5275.98] No.
[5276.14 → 5276.70] Shall danger?
[5277.04 → 5277.30] No.
[5277.46 → 5278.04] Shall sword?
[5278.34 → 5278.78] No.
[5279.98 → 5281.00] To every one
[5281.00 → 5282.32] of those very real,
[5282.44 → 5283.64] very present suffering,
[5283.64 → 5284.84] Paul says,
[5285.10 → 5285.42] no.
[5286.28 → 5288.34] They have no power
[5288.34 → 5289.76] to separate you
[5289.76 → 5291.02] from the love of God.
[5292.32 → 5292.80] No.
[5293.00 → 5294.78] In all these things
[5294.78 → 5297.26] we are more than conquerors
[5297.26 → 5297.98] through Him
[5297.98 → 5300.02] who loved us.
[5301.24 → 5302.18] And if you have the ears
[5302.18 → 5302.60] to hear,
[5302.74 → 5304.40] hear the extravagance
[5304.40 → 5305.76] in that statement.
[5306.56 → 5306.92] Right?
[5306.96 → 5308.00] Because it would be enough
[5308.00 → 5309.18] to just be a conqueror.
[5309.20 → 5309.38] Right?
[5309.38 → 5311.96] But we are more
[5311.96 → 5313.46] than conquerors.
[5314.66 → 5314.78] Right?
[5314.80 → 5315.60] To be a conqueror
[5315.60 → 5316.40] would be enough.
[5316.78 → 5316.94] Right?
[5317.18 → 5318.98] But to be more
[5318.98 → 5320.14] than a conqueror,
[5320.28 → 5321.68] it's not just
[5321.68 → 5322.50] that we have conquered
[5322.50 → 5323.52] sin and death
[5323.52 → 5324.46] in this life,
[5324.58 → 5325.76] but we are
[5325.76 → 5326.64] an inheritor
[5326.64 → 5327.50] of the kingdom.
[5327.90 → 5329.26] We are an heir of God
[5329.26 → 5329.98] and a co-heir
[5329.98 → 5330.60] with Christ.
[5330.84 → 5331.88] And by the Spirit
[5331.88 → 5332.94] we cry,
[5333.18 → 5333.58] Abba,
[5333.86 → 5334.34] Father.
[5335.18 → 5336.12] We are more
[5336.12 → 5337.08] than conquerors.
[5337.08 → 5339.68] For I am convinced
[5339.68 → 5341.14] that neither death
[5341.14 → 5341.84] nor life,
[5341.98 → 5342.60] neither angels
[5342.60 → 5343.22] nor demons,
[5343.36 → 5344.04] neither the present
[5344.04 → 5344.90] nor the future
[5344.90 → 5346.00] nor any powers,
[5346.46 → 5347.26] neither height
[5347.26 → 5347.86] nor depth
[5347.86 → 5349.26] nor anything else
[5349.26 → 5350.52] in all creation
[5350.52 → 5351.42] will be able
[5351.42 → 5352.32] to separate us
[5352.32 → 5353.48] from the love
[5353.48 → 5354.18] of God
[5354.18 → 5355.40] that is in Christ
[5355.40 → 5357.80] Jesus our Lord.
[5358.54 → 5359.02] Death
[5359.02 → 5361.40] has no power.
[5362.44 → 5362.80] Life
[5362.80 → 5363.86] has no
[5363.86 → 5364.68] allure
[5364.68 → 5365.24] greater
[5365.24 → 5366.58] than the love
[5366.58 → 5367.30] of God
[5367.30 → 5368.76] through Jesus.
[5369.88 → 5371.24] There is no power
[5371.24 → 5372.52] whether it is spiritual,
[5372.72 → 5373.32] whether it's angels
[5373.32 → 5373.82] or demons,
[5373.94 → 5374.80] there is no power
[5374.80 → 5375.74] whether it is earthly,
[5376.08 → 5376.64] be it governments
[5376.64 → 5377.24] or armies,
[5377.40 → 5378.60] or even the power
[5378.60 → 5379.76] of time itself.
[5380.26 → 5380.66] Nothing
[5380.66 → 5382.32] in all creation
[5382.32 → 5382.92] is enough
[5382.92 → 5384.06] to separate us
[5384.06 → 5385.18] from the love
[5385.18 → 5386.24] of God.
[5387.12 → 5387.92] And of this
[5387.92 → 5389.52] you can be convinced
[5389.52 → 5391.48] because God
[5391.48 → 5392.52] is
[5392.52 → 5393.78] for you.
[5394.68 → 5396.40] and because
[5396.40 → 5397.80] God is for you,
[5398.50 → 5399.32] you are
[5399.32 → 5399.94] more
[5399.94 → 5400.78] than
[5400.78 → 5402.06] conquerors.
[5403.36 → 5404.50] This is the kind
[5404.50 → 5405.04] of truth
[5405.04 → 5406.50] that led
[5406.50 → 5407.30] Christians
[5407.30 → 5408.32] in the early church
[5408.32 → 5408.84] to be burned
[5408.84 → 5409.36] at the stake.
[5410.24 → 5411.18] This is the kind
[5411.18 → 5411.70] of conviction
[5411.70 → 5412.52] that led Christians
[5412.52 → 5413.38] in the Reformation
[5413.38 → 5414.06] to stand
[5414.06 → 5415.06] against power
[5415.06 → 5415.62] and abuses
[5415.62 → 5416.52] of authority
[5416.52 → 5417.46] that were taking place
[5417.46 → 5418.46] even though
[5418.46 → 5419.08] they were being
[5419.08 → 5419.72] killed for it.
[5420.20 → 5421.16] This is the kind
[5421.16 → 5421.76] of truth
[5421.76 → 5422.44] and conviction
[5422.44 → 5423.40] that leads Christians
[5423.40 → 5424.18] throughout the world
[5424.18 → 5424.94] even today
[5424.94 → 5427.24] into prison
[5427.24 → 5428.32] to face
[5428.32 → 5429.12] beheadings
[5429.12 → 5430.60] because they know
[5430.60 → 5431.62] who they are
[5431.62 → 5433.08] in Christ Jesus
[5433.08 → 5434.46] because they know
[5434.46 → 5436.50] who God is.
[5437.78 → 5438.68] And as we live
[5438.68 → 5439.14] today
[5439.14 → 5439.84] in an ever
[5439.84 → 5440.80] increasingly
[5440.80 → 5441.80] post-Christian
[5441.80 → 5442.28] world
[5442.28 → 5444.00] this is the kind
[5444.00 → 5444.56] of truth
[5444.56 → 5445.88] that we will need
[5445.88 → 5446.94] to be convicted
[5446.94 → 5447.84] of.
[5449.00 → 5450.20] If our God
[5450.20 → 5451.20] is for us
[5451.20 → 5452.62] who can be
[5452.62 → 5453.70] against us
[5453.70 → 5456.82] and our God
[5456.82 → 5457.68] is for us
[5457.68 → 5459.54] and so I will
[5459.54 → 5460.44] talk to my
[5460.44 → 5461.48] unbelieving neighbour
[5461.48 → 5462.30] or friend
[5462.30 → 5463.46] or colleague
[5463.46 → 5464.28] at work
[5464.28 → 5465.22] even if it
[5465.22 → 5466.04] makes me look
[5466.04 → 5466.68] weird.
[5467.26 → 5468.16] Even if it
[5468.16 → 5468.98] costs me
[5468.98 → 5469.80] something.
[5471.74 → 5472.58] Our God
[5472.58 → 5474.24] is for us.
[5474.58 → 5475.42] I am already
[5475.42 → 5476.24] more than a
[5476.24 → 5476.72] conqueror
[5476.72 → 5477.58] and so I will
[5477.58 → 5478.88] sacrifice my time
[5478.88 → 5479.88] and my privilege
[5479.88 → 5480.66] to serve
[5480.66 → 5481.38] those people
[5481.38 → 5482.54] in my community
[5482.54 → 5483.64] who need
[5483.64 → 5484.52] more of Him.
[5485.88 → 5486.94] God is
[5486.94 → 5487.80] for me
[5487.80 → 5489.16] and so in all
[5489.16 → 5490.28] of these things
[5490.28 → 5491.64] I will be
[5491.64 → 5492.80] for God.
[5492.80 → 5495.92] and I believe
[5495.92 → 5497.58] that we are
[5497.58 → 5498.64] starting to see
[5498.64 → 5499.58] here in this
[5499.58 → 5499.92] church
[5499.92 → 5501.30] what it could
[5501.30 → 5501.86] be like
[5501.86 → 5502.58] if we went
[5502.58 → 5503.28] out with
[5503.28 → 5504.08] this conviction
[5504.08 → 5504.82] more and more
[5504.82 → 5505.30] in the power
[5505.30 → 5505.76] of the Spirit.
[5507.70 → 5508.60] And so go
[5508.60 → 5508.92] out
[5508.92 → 5510.76] and in the
[5510.76 → 5511.40] depths of
[5511.40 → 5511.98] your heart
[5511.98 → 5512.78] in the very
[5512.78 → 5513.84] core of
[5513.84 → 5515.02] you're being
[5515.02 → 5516.12] live this
[5516.12 → 5516.86] truth
[5516.86 → 5517.90] and watch
[5517.90 → 5518.82] God's kingdom
[5518.82 → 5520.04] come in
[5520.04 → 5520.44] you
[5520.44 → 5521.52] and around
[5521.52 → 5521.88] you.
[5522.80 → 5524.64] If God
[5524.64 → 5525.94] is for us
[5525.94 → 5526.58] who
[5526.58 → 5528.46] can be
[5528.46 → 5529.28] against us?
[5529.86 → 5530.10] Amen?
[5530.88 → 5531.82] Let's pray
[5531.82 → 5532.16] together.
[5537.02 → 5537.82] God
[5537.82 → 5538.82] you are
[5538.82 → 5540.44] for us.
[5545.30 → 5546.14] You
[5546.14 → 5546.80] are
[5546.80 → 5548.44] for us
[5548.44 → 5548.94] and you
[5548.94 → 5549.30] have
[5549.30 → 5550.70] made us
[5550.70 → 5551.56] by grace
[5551.56 → 5552.46] through faith
[5552.46 → 5553.12] to be
[5553.12 → 5553.78] more
[5553.78 → 5554.58] than
[5554.58 → 5555.52] conquerors
[5555.52 → 5556.02] because
[5556.02 → 5557.46] Jesus Christ
[5557.46 → 5558.38] has conquered
[5558.38 → 5558.98] sin
[5558.98 → 5560.04] and death
[5560.04 → 5562.88] and in
[5562.88 → 5563.16] him
[5563.16 → 5564.18] and with
[5564.18 → 5564.50] him
[5564.50 → 5565.16] we now
[5565.16 → 5565.74] stand
[5565.74 → 5568.00] as conquerors
[5568.00 → 5569.36] and so
[5569.36 → 5570.68] Lord Jesus
[5570.68 → 5571.74] hear our
[5571.74 → 5572.42] prayers
[5572.42 → 5574.44] and send
[5574.44 → 5575.06] us out
[5575.06 → 5575.90] in the power
[5575.90 → 5576.90] of your
[5576.90 → 5577.48] spirit
[5577.48 → 5579.50] that we
[5579.50 → 5580.24] together
[5580.24 → 5581.36] might be
[5581.36 → 5582.52] the answer
[5582.52 → 5584.26] to someone's
[5584.26 → 5585.02] prayer
[5585.02 → 5587.08] that we
[5587.08 → 5587.62] together
[5587.62 → 5588.52] might be
[5588.52 → 5589.42] the means
[5589.42 → 5589.94] by which
[5589.94 → 5590.76] people in
[5590.76 → 5591.54] our lives
[5591.54 → 5591.98] in our
[5591.98 → 5592.38] neighbourhood
[5592.38 → 5592.96] and in
[5592.96 → 5593.62] our city
[5593.62 → 5594.48] come to
[5594.48 → 5595.50] see that
[5595.50 → 5596.06] you
[5596.06 → 5597.00] are
[5597.00 → 5597.90] God
[5597.90 → 5599.20] that you
[5599.20 → 5599.68] are
[5599.68 → 5600.54] good
[5600.54 → 5600.98] and that
[5600.98 → 5601.24] your
[5601.24 → 5602.18] gospel
[5602.18 → 5603.32] is
[5603.32 → 5604.20] glorious
[5604.20 → 5607.18] send us
[5607.18 → 5607.46] out
[5607.46 → 5607.80] in the
[5607.80 → 5608.30] power
[5608.30 → 5609.32] of your
[5609.32 → 5609.82] name
[5609.82 → 5610.22] Lord
[5610.22 → 5610.62] Jesus
[5610.62 → 5611.18] Christ
[5611.18 → 5613.00] it's in
[5613.00 → 5614.00] your name
[5614.00 → 5614.58] that we
[5614.58 → 5614.90] pray
[5614.90 → 5616.18] amen
[5616.18 → 5643.16] my soul
[5643.16 → 5644.06] lives rest
[5644.06 → 5645.00] in God
[5645.00 → 5646.36] alone
[5646.36 → 5647.82] my rock
[5647.82 → 5648.64] and my
[5648.64 → 5650.42] salvation
[5650.42 → 5652.60] my fortress
[5652.60 → 5653.74] on the
[5653.74 → 5654.22] face
[5654.22 → 5655.68] my foes
[5655.68 → 5656.98] and I
[5656.98 → 5657.90] will not
[5657.90 → 5659.54] be shaken
[5659.54 → 5660.98] though
[5660.98 → 5661.94] lives may
[5661.94 → 5662.42] bless
[5662.42 → 5662.84] and
[5662.84 → 5663.30] hearts
[5663.30 → 5663.78] may
[5663.78 → 5664.86] curse
[5664.86 → 5665.48] and
[5665.48 → 5666.00] lies
[5666.00 → 5666.42] like
[5666.42 → 5667.20] arrows
[5667.20 → 5668.02] near
[5668.02 → 5669.04] see
[5669.04 → 5670.00] I'll
[5670.00 → 5670.42] fix
[5670.42 → 5670.90] my
[5670.90 → 5671.40] heart
[5671.40 → 5673.58] unrighteousness
[5673.58 → 5674.56] I'll
[5674.56 → 5675.36] look to
[5675.36 → 5675.94] him
[5675.94 → 5676.30] who
[5676.30 → 5677.28] hears
[5677.28 → 5678.40] me
[5678.40 → 5679.74] oh

[5709.34 → 5709.76] my
[5709.76 → 5710.22] soul
[5710.22 → 5710.66] in
[5710.66 → 5711.20] God
[5711.20 → 5712.46] alone
[5712.46 → 5713.68] amid
[5713.68 → 5714.10] the
[5714.10 → 5714.72] world's
[5714.72 → 5716.76] temptations
[5716.76 → 5717.72] when
[5717.72 → 5718.34] evil
[5718.34 → 5718.90] seems
[5718.90 → 5719.26] to
[5719.26 → 5719.88] take
[5719.88 → 5721.22] a hold
[5721.22 → 5722.06] I'll
[5722.06 → 5722.38] bring
[5722.38 → 5722.74] to
[5722.74 → 5723.28] my
[5723.28 → 5724.76] salvation
[5724.76 → 5725.76] love
[5725.76 → 5726.30] though

[5786.42 → 5786.88] his

[5788.02 → 5789.26] though
[5789.26 → 5789.76] life
[5789.76 → 5790.16] is
[5790.16 → 5790.58] not

[5796.24 → 5797.74] my
