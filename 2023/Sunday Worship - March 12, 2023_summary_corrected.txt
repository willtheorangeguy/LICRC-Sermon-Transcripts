• Hope and peace come from standing together in God's glory
• God's glory is powerful in the life of a believer
• Everything that happens is for God's glory
• All history is focused on God's glory
• Everything done by God is for His own glory
• God's work in the world is focused on His glory
• It only makes sense that everything is done for God's glory
• God's goal in history is to display His glory and bring honour, praise, and recognition of His name.

• History records instances where individuals have been used by God to capture the significance of this concept.

• Creation and the difference between hoping in God's glory vs common sense
• The word "hope" in English is weak and can be a desire for something to happen, but it doesn't guarantee certainty
• Christian hope isn't just a wish, but a conviction that we might come true
• Christian hope is contrasted with worldly hopes which may not lead to certainty or guarantee a future glory
• The resurrection of Jesus guarantees the future glory of God and gives us hope that our current life has meaning in it.
• Hope is closely connected to the glory of God
• Suffering produces perseverance, which leads to character and hope
• Perseverance, character, and hope are interconnected and ultimately lead to glorifying God
• Despite suffering, one can have hope because it produces perseverance and character
• The end goal is to be made new in Christ and glorify God
• Suffering and hope are interconnected
• Misunderstanding of the nature of suffering and joy in Christian theology
