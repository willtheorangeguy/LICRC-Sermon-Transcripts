[1921.84 --> 1944.02]  Good morning. Today's special offering is for the Benevolence Fund. This is an ongoing fund that the deacons have so that when needs arise in our church family or in local community, we are able to assist them and be a witness to them. It is our opportunity for us to be able to bless them. Thank you.
[1951.84 --> 1981.82]  Thank you.

[2212.34 --> 2218.58]  So I'll rest in your embrace
[2218.58 --> 2222.30]  I am yours
[2222.30 --> 2226.40]  You are mine
[2226.40 --> 2256.38]  At this time I would love if any of the kids who are going to head out to children's worship time
[2256.38 --> 2261.04]  And so join a summer that is age 3 through kindergarten
[2261.04 --> 2263.54]  So if you're here come on up to the front
[2263.54 --> 2266.00]  We're going to do the kids blessing together
[2266.00 --> 2270.76]  If you are a leader or going to help them
[2270.76 --> 2272.98]  You can also come up to the front if you want
[2272.98 --> 2275.56]  No?
[2275.88 --> 2276.22]  No?
[2276.22 --> 2276.26]  No?
[2277.18 --> 2277.72]  All right
[2277.72 --> 2279.04]  Guys why don't we just stand up
[2279.04 --> 2281.60]  We're going to do the blessing
[2281.60 --> 2282.48]  Do you remember how to do that?
[2284.32 --> 2284.72]  Four
[2284.72 --> 2286.40]  Perfect
[2286.40 --> 2287.08]  Right?
[2287.18 --> 2287.90]  Four is a great number
[2287.90 --> 2289.84]  So we're going to hold our hands up
[2289.84 --> 2290.60]  We're going to say
[2290.60 --> 2291.70]  The Lord be with you
[2291.70 --> 2294.06]  And then everyone here is going to respond by saying
[2294.06 --> 2294.92]  And also with you
[2294.92 --> 2296.02]  So let's stand together
[2296.02 --> 2298.22]  Let's turn around and face everyone
[2298.22 --> 2300.04]  Together we say
[2300.04 --> 2302.60]  The Lord be with you
[2302.60 --> 2304.78]  And also with you
[2304.78 --> 2305.44]  Awesome
[2305.44 --> 2305.72]  All right
[2305.72 --> 2306.72]  You guys head out
[2306.72 --> 2309.02]  There will be some helpers and teachers and the like
[2309.02 --> 2310.50]  Who will collect you
[2310.50 --> 2335.20]  I'm Eric
[2335.20 --> 2336.60]  An elder here at Emmanuel
[2336.60 --> 2339.32]  And I'll be leading you this morning in our church family prayer
[2339.32 --> 2339.94]  Let us bow
[2339.94 --> 2342.42]  Sing to the Lord all the earth
[2342.42 --> 2344.88]  Proclaim his salvation day after day
[2344.88 --> 2347.24]  Declare his glory among the nations
[2347.24 --> 2349.94]  His marvelous deeds among all the people
[2349.94 --> 2352.58]  For great is the Lord and most worthy of praise
[2352.58 --> 2359.02]  This morning we give you praise for the unity of Micah and Jane Closterhoff
[2359.02 --> 2360.98]  This past week Friday in marriage
[2360.98 --> 2365.08]  May you bless them as they embark on their journey as a married couple
[2365.08 --> 2368.34]  This week we also learned that Elise Wagner
[2368.34 --> 2370.82]  Biopsy results showed no cancer
[2370.82 --> 2372.42]  No cancer at all at this time
[2372.42 --> 2373.40]  We praise you Lord
[2373.40 --> 2375.84]  Also this past month
[2375.84 --> 2378.10]  Si Visser has completed his chemo treatments
[2378.10 --> 2383.36]  And after initial x-rays have indicated no sign of the cancer
[2383.36 --> 2387.24]  He has started his immunotherapy for the next year
[2387.24 --> 2392.18]  Which will be once a month and we pray that you be with them through the rest of their journey
[2392.18 --> 2394.30]  Praise be to you Lord
[2394.30 --> 2396.24]  God of our father of Israel
[2396.24 --> 2398.04]  From everlasting to everlasting
[2398.04 --> 2404.96]  We are thankful that Ellen White was transferred from Tawasin Hospital to Langley Memorial Hospital
[2404.96 --> 2409.70]  And has she has been starting her rehabilitation starting a little bit of walking
[2409.70 --> 2414.54]  It still will be a long road to a full recovery Lord but it's nice being closer to home
[2414.54 --> 2421.28]  We also wanted to pray for class Tessa maker as he's also in Langley Memorial Hospital
[2421.28 --> 2425.30]  We pray for answers and healing in regarding to his health concerns
[2425.30 --> 2433.18]  We also want to keep Marguerite shown in her prayers as she will have surgery later this month
[2433.18 --> 2437.92]  Keep her safe in her journey with that as well Lord
[2437.92 --> 2446.36]  We also pray for Rose Vita who suffers from an immune disease that's been struggling with of late Lord
[2446.36 --> 2447.92]  We ask you be a comfort to her
[2447.92 --> 2455.08]  Lord we thank you at this time of year where many of us get to take our time off
[2455.08 --> 2458.62]  And take some holidays with loved ones and family
[2458.62 --> 2462.98]  We pay for traveling mercies and a restful time with family and friends
[2462.98 --> 2467.06]  May you bless us all as we go through our week
[2467.06 --> 2472.12]  And be grounded and rooted in your word in Jesus name we pray amen
[2472.12 --> 2496.68]  This summer we're doing
[2496.68 --> 2509.64]  A series looking at faith heroes in the bible and in our own lives and stories and and from that
[2509.64 --> 2510.84]  hoping
[2510.84 --> 2514.42]  That we ourselves might be
[2514.42 --> 2519.30]  Encouraged might be equipped to share our own faith stories
[2519.30 --> 2526.58]  As a way of encouraging people around us and those others whom we meet or in our life together
[2526.58 --> 2537.46]  Today we're going to look at the character from the bible named abel and we're going to read his story from genesis 4
[2537.46 --> 2541.36]  The first 16 verses and so if you have a bible
[2541.36 --> 2546.36]  I encourage you to open that up or to turn that on to find genesis 4
[2546.36 --> 2549.62]  Which is at the very beginning in my bible?
[2549.62 --> 2552.64]  It's page 3 so it shouldn't be too hard to find
[2552.64 --> 2555.46]  Even if this is the first time you've opened the bible
[2555.46 --> 2560.74]  And so we'll read the first 16 verses together
[2560.74 --> 2561.70]  There
[2561.70 --> 2563.20]  Let's read
[2563.20 --> 2567.66]  Adam
[2567.66 --> 2571.68]  Adam made love to his wife eve and she became pregnant
[2571.68 --> 2573.92]  And gave birth to cain
[2573.92 --> 2578.72]  She said with the help of the lord. I have brought forth a man
[2578.72 --> 2580.24]  Later
[2580.24 --> 2582.58]  She gave birth to abel
[2582.58 --> 2587.66]  Now abel kept flocks and cain worked the soil
[2587.66 --> 2594.04]  In the course of time cain brought some of his fruits of the soil as an offering to the lord
[2594.04 --> 2600.16]  And abel also brought an offering fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock
[2600.16 --> 2604.36]  The lord looked with favor on abel and his offering
[2604.36 --> 2608.22]  But on cain and his offering he did not look with favor
[2608.22 --> 2613.44]  So cain was very angry and his face was downcast
[2613.44 --> 2616.30]  Then the lord said to cain
[2616.30 --> 2618.84]  Why are you angry?
[2618.98 --> 2620.54]  Why is your face downcast?
[2620.76 --> 2624.16]  If you do what is right will you not be accepted?
[2625.00 --> 2627.62]  But if you do not do what is right
[2627.62 --> 2630.60]  Sin is crouching at your door
[2630.60 --> 2632.52]  It desires to have you
[2632.52 --> 2635.12]  But you must rule over it
[2635.12 --> 2639.58]  Now cain said to his brother abel
[2639.58 --> 2640.90]  Let's go out to the field
[2640.90 --> 2644.14]  While they were in the field
[2644.14 --> 2647.08]  Cain attacked his brother abel
[2647.08 --> 2648.46]  And killed him
[2648.46 --> 2652.22]  Then the lord said to cain
[2652.22 --> 2655.36]  Where is your brother abel?
[2656.20 --> 2658.14]  I don't know he replied
[2658.14 --> 2659.70]  Am I my brother's keeper?
[2661.16 --> 2662.40]  The lord said
[2662.40 --> 2664.34]  What have you done?
[2664.92 --> 2665.30]  Listen
[2665.30 --> 2669.12]  Your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground
[2669.12 --> 2672.12]  Now you are under a curse
[2672.12 --> 2673.46]  And driven from the ground
[2673.46 --> 2677.32]  Which opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand
[2677.32 --> 2679.20]  When you work the ground
[2679.20 --> 2681.38]  It will no longer yield its crops for you
[2681.38 --> 2685.00]  You will be a restless wanderer on the earth
[2685.00 --> 2688.46]  Cain said to the lord
[2688.46 --> 2691.22]  My punishment is more than I can bear
[2691.22 --> 2693.76]  Today you are driving me from the land
[2693.76 --> 2695.38]  And I will be hidden from your presence
[2695.38 --> 2697.86]  I will be a restless wanderer on the earth
[2697.86 --> 2700.12]  And whoever finds me will kill me
[2700.12 --> 2702.54]  But the lord said to him
[2702.54 --> 2703.68]  Not so
[2703.68 --> 2705.58]  Anyone who kills cain
[2705.58 --> 2708.62]  Will suffer vengeance seven times over
[2708.62 --> 2711.58]  Then the lord put a mark on cain
[2711.58 --> 2713.44]  So that no one who found him
[2713.44 --> 2714.64]  Would kill him
[2714.64 --> 2717.68]  So cain went out from the lord's presence
[2717.68 --> 2719.56]  And lived in the land of nod
[2719.56 --> 2721.38]  East of eden
[2721.38 --> 2723.92]  This is the word of the lord
[2723.92 --> 2731.84]  Now the story of abel
[2731.84 --> 2734.44]  Or the story of cain and abel
[2734.44 --> 2737.20]  Starts pretty simple
[2737.20 --> 2739.60]  And starts straightforward enough
[2739.60 --> 2741.80]  It starts with a birth announcement
[2741.80 --> 2744.42]  Adam and eve
[2744.42 --> 2745.86]  Have cain
[2745.86 --> 2747.40]  And eve says
[2747.40 --> 2749.10]  With the help of the lord
[2749.10 --> 2751.20]  I have brought forth a man
[2751.20 --> 2753.86]  Now the name cain
[2753.86 --> 2755.16]  In hebrew
[2755.16 --> 2756.82]  Sounds very similar
[2756.82 --> 2759.24]  To the hebrew word
[2759.24 --> 2760.82]  That means brought forth
[2760.82 --> 2763.00]  So there's a play on words going on here
[2763.00 --> 2764.64]  And then
[2764.64 --> 2765.88]  Right afterwards
[2765.88 --> 2768.48]  There's a second birth announcement
[2768.48 --> 2769.86]  Later
[2769.86 --> 2771.96]  She gave birth to abel
[2771.96 --> 2774.04]  Now cain
[2774.04 --> 2776.66]  Means or sounds like brought forth
[2776.66 --> 2777.68]  Abel
[2777.68 --> 2779.72]  Is also really interesting
[2779.72 --> 2781.82]  Abel
[2781.82 --> 2782.38]  Or abel
[2782.38 --> 2782.94]  Abel
[2782.94 --> 2784.78]  Is the hebrew word
[2784.78 --> 2785.86]  For breath
[2785.86 --> 2787.56]  Or for vapor
[2787.56 --> 2790.50]  It's the hebrew word
[2790.50 --> 2791.42]  For vanity
[2791.42 --> 2793.92]  It's the same word
[2793.92 --> 2795.00]  That the teacher uses
[2795.00 --> 2796.32]  In the book of ecclesiastes
[2796.32 --> 2797.02]  Right
[2797.02 --> 2797.84]  You might know it as
[2797.84 --> 2798.48]  Meaningless
[2798.48 --> 2799.28]  Meaningless
[2799.28 --> 2800.24]  Everything
[2800.24 --> 2801.44]  Is meaningless
[2801.44 --> 2803.32]  The old translation
[2803.32 --> 2804.20]  Of that is
[2804.20 --> 2804.76]  Vanity
[2804.76 --> 2805.86]  Of vanities
[2805.86 --> 2806.80]  Everything
[2806.80 --> 2807.96]  Is vanity
[2807.96 --> 2810.74]  Abel's very name
[2810.74 --> 2811.42]  Havel
[2811.42 --> 2812.90]  Is a commentary
[2812.90 --> 2814.24]  On his life
[2814.24 --> 2815.96]  It will be short
[2815.96 --> 2817.78]  And it will be in vain
[2817.78 --> 2820.56]  And then
[2820.56 --> 2821.50]  As we go on
[2821.50 --> 2823.28]  Between the two sentences
[2823.28 --> 2826.72]  We have later
[2826.72 --> 2829.26]  And then
[2829.26 --> 2829.92]  Now
[2829.92 --> 2831.12]  Abel kept flocks
[2831.12 --> 2831.76]  And cain
[2831.76 --> 2832.84]  Worked the soil
[2832.84 --> 2835.10]  Between those two sentences
[2835.10 --> 2836.12]  Is a lifetime
[2836.12 --> 2838.78]  We know very little
[2838.78 --> 2839.82]  Of that lifetime
[2839.82 --> 2840.88]  Except that
[2840.88 --> 2841.38]  They're now
[2841.38 --> 2842.02]  Old enough
[2842.02 --> 2843.00]  To be identified
[2843.00 --> 2844.12]  By what they do
[2844.12 --> 2845.42]  Right
[2845.42 --> 2846.22]  Keeping flocks
[2846.22 --> 2847.62]  Or working soil
[2847.62 --> 2848.94]  They're old enough
[2848.94 --> 2849.94]  To have
[2849.94 --> 2851.32]  Careers
[2851.32 --> 2852.24]  That associate
[2852.24 --> 2852.76]  Them
[2852.76 --> 2853.60]  In the world
[2853.60 --> 2855.32]  And then
[2855.32 --> 2857.08]  In the course
[2857.08 --> 2857.86]  Of time
[2857.86 --> 2859.84]  The opportunity
[2859.84 --> 2860.48]  Comes
[2860.48 --> 2860.90]  For them
[2860.90 --> 2861.40]  To bring
[2861.40 --> 2862.80]  An offering
[2862.80 --> 2864.86]  The time
[2864.86 --> 2866.12]  To worship
[2866.12 --> 2867.28]  Comes
[2867.28 --> 2868.38]  And there's
[2868.38 --> 2868.94]  A recognition
[2868.94 --> 2870.20]  Of need
[2870.20 --> 2872.00]  So cain
[2872.00 --> 2872.70]  Brought some
[2872.70 --> 2873.68]  Fruits of soil
[2873.68 --> 2874.70]  And abel
[2874.70 --> 2875.58]  Brought fat
[2875.58 --> 2876.26]  Portions
[2876.26 --> 2877.06]  From some
[2877.06 --> 2877.98]  Of the firstborn
[2877.98 --> 2878.84]  Of his flock
[2878.84 --> 2880.76]  And then
[2880.76 --> 2881.22]  We read
[2881.22 --> 2881.92]  That the lord
[2881.92 --> 2883.08]  Looked with favor
[2883.08 --> 2884.12]  On the offering
[2884.12 --> 2885.20]  Of abel
[2885.20 --> 2887.36]  And he did not
[2887.36 --> 2888.22]  Look with favor
[2888.22 --> 2889.30]  On the offering
[2889.30 --> 2890.16]  Of cain
[2890.16 --> 2892.16]  Now as we read
[2892.16 --> 2892.62]  This
[2892.62 --> 2894.54]  At least for myself
[2894.54 --> 2895.82]  It begs the question
[2895.82 --> 2896.68]  Every time
[2896.68 --> 2897.50]  Why
[2897.50 --> 2898.48]  Right
[2898.48 --> 2899.30]  Why is
[2899.30 --> 2900.74]  Abel's offering
[2900.74 --> 2902.18]  Good and received
[2902.18 --> 2903.72]  And why is cain's
[2903.72 --> 2904.38]  Not
[2904.38 --> 2906.16]  Now
[2906.16 --> 2907.56]  I'll tell you
[2907.56 --> 2908.14]  That there's
[2908.14 --> 2909.42]  Lots of debate
[2909.42 --> 2910.78]  In bible scholars
[2910.78 --> 2911.68]  And in theology
[2911.68 --> 2912.98]  On why this
[2912.98 --> 2913.84]  Is the case
[2913.84 --> 2915.68]  And some people
[2915.68 --> 2916.92]  Point out to the fact
[2916.92 --> 2917.62]  That abel
[2917.62 --> 2918.68]  Brought the
[2918.68 --> 2920.00]  Fat portions
[2920.00 --> 2921.12]  Of the firstborn
[2921.12 --> 2921.92]  Of his flock
[2921.92 --> 2923.16]  And it's a way
[2923.16 --> 2923.54]  Of saying
[2923.54 --> 2924.10]  The best
[2924.10 --> 2924.80]  Of the best
[2924.80 --> 2927.08]  And that cain
[2927.08 --> 2929.02]  Brought only
[2929.02 --> 2930.40]  Some fruits
[2930.40 --> 2931.34]  Of the soil
[2931.34 --> 2932.34]  And there's no
[2932.34 --> 2933.42]  Mention of the quality
[2933.42 --> 2936.34]  In the first case
[2936.34 --> 2937.98]  There seems to be
[2937.98 --> 2939.42]  A parallel going on
[2939.42 --> 2940.44]  Between these two
[2940.44 --> 2941.06]  Offerings
[2941.06 --> 2942.02]  And what will later
[2942.02 --> 2942.94]  Be written about
[2942.94 --> 2943.96]  In the book of the law
[2943.96 --> 2945.12]  In the book of Leviticus
[2945.12 --> 2946.64]  Leviticus 3
[2946.64 --> 2947.56]  Will describe
[2947.56 --> 2948.94]  Offerings that require
[2948.94 --> 2949.98]  The fat portions
[2949.98 --> 2950.98]  Of the first fruit
[2950.98 --> 2952.28]  And Leviticus 2
[2952.28 --> 2953.22]  Will require
[2953.22 --> 2954.20]  And talk about
[2954.20 --> 2955.60]  Offerings of grain
[2955.60 --> 2956.76]  Or as a substitute
[2956.76 --> 2957.30]  For that
[2957.30 --> 2958.44]  Vegetable
[2958.44 --> 2961.46]  Now the problem
[2961.46 --> 2962.88]  With this interpretation
[2962.88 --> 2963.96]  That it's the
[2963.96 --> 2965.46]  Thing that is brought
[2965.46 --> 2966.24]  In offering
[2966.24 --> 2967.48]  That leads to God
[2967.48 --> 2968.48]  Being displeased
[2968.48 --> 2969.48]  Or receiving it
[2969.48 --> 2970.22]  In pleasure
[2970.22 --> 2971.42]  Is that it's an argument
[2971.42 --> 2972.02]  From silence
[2972.02 --> 2972.52]  That is to say
[2972.52 --> 2973.76]  That we can't know
[2973.76 --> 2975.38]  Right
[2975.38 --> 2976.22]  It seems clear
[2976.22 --> 2977.04]  That the author
[2977.04 --> 2978.74]  Is also holding
[2978.74 --> 2979.56]  Leviticus 2
[2979.56 --> 2980.16]  And 3
[2980.16 --> 2981.16]  Sort of intention
[2981.16 --> 2982.38]  With this
[2982.38 --> 2983.62]  Right
[2983.62 --> 2985.56]  But
[2985.56 --> 2987.70]  It doesn't seem clear
[2987.70 --> 2988.90]  Because those two things
[2988.90 --> 2989.52]  Are not weighted
[2989.52 --> 2990.66]  Against each other
[2990.66 --> 2991.80]  In Leviticus
[2991.80 --> 2992.74]  That they should be
[2992.74 --> 2994.14]  Weighted against each other
[2994.14 --> 2996.28]  Here in Genesis 4
[2996.28 --> 2998.22]  Instead
[2998.22 --> 2999.74]  As we keep
[2999.74 --> 3000.92]  Reading the Bible
[3000.92 --> 3001.64]  As we keep
[3001.64 --> 3002.48]  Letting Scripture
[3002.48 --> 3003.54]  Interpret Scripture
[3003.54 --> 3004.96]  What seems to be
[3004.96 --> 3005.66]  Going on
[3005.66 --> 3006.72]  What seems to be
[3006.72 --> 3008.74]  The determining factor
[3008.74 --> 3010.98]  Is the attitude
[3010.98 --> 3012.86]  Or is the heart
[3012.86 --> 3014.24]  Of the giver
[3014.24 --> 3016.86]  This is confirmed
[3016.86 --> 3017.42]  For us
[3017.42 --> 3018.80]  In Hebrews 11
[3018.80 --> 3019.80]  And so as we are
[3019.80 --> 3020.74]  Looking at this series
[3020.74 --> 3022.08]  Faith heroes
[3022.08 --> 3022.80]  We are using
[3022.80 --> 3023.68]  Hebrews 11
[3023.68 --> 3025.24]  As the list
[3025.24 --> 3026.40]  To identify those
[3026.40 --> 3027.50]  And then applying them
[3027.50 --> 3028.02]  Here
[3028.02 --> 3029.06]  But Hebrews 11
[3029.06 --> 3029.92]  Verse 4
[3029.92 --> 3030.32]  Said
[3030.32 --> 3032.80]  By faith
[3032.80 --> 3033.42]  Abel
[3033.42 --> 3034.60]  Brought a better
[3034.60 --> 3035.62]  Offering
[3035.62 --> 3036.54]  Than Cain did
[3036.54 --> 3038.32]  By faith
[3038.32 --> 3039.44]  He was commended
[3039.44 --> 3040.54]  As righteous
[3040.54 --> 3041.70]  When God spoke
[3041.70 --> 3042.82]  Well of his offering
[3042.82 --> 3044.54]  And by faith
[3044.54 --> 3046.56]  Abel still speaks
[3046.56 --> 3047.94]  Even though
[3047.94 --> 3048.92]  He is dead
[3048.92 --> 3051.22]  And so what
[3051.22 --> 3052.48]  Separates Abel's
[3052.48 --> 3052.96]  Offering
[3052.96 --> 3053.68]  From Cain's
[3053.68 --> 3054.04]  Offering
[3054.04 --> 3054.88]  According to Hebrews
[3054.88 --> 3057.04]  His faith
[3057.04 --> 3058.58]  Right
[3058.58 --> 3059.68]  The character
[3059.68 --> 3061.44]  Of his heart
[3061.44 --> 3062.40]  The thing
[3062.40 --> 3063.46]  That was pouring
[3063.46 --> 3064.46]  Out of him
[3064.46 --> 3065.30]  Not the thing
[3065.30 --> 3065.96]  That he brought
[3065.96 --> 3067.88]  He is commended
[3067.88 --> 3068.62]  As righteous
[3068.62 --> 3069.40]  Because of
[3069.40 --> 3070.48]  His faith
[3070.48 --> 3072.58]  How does he
[3072.58 --> 3073.90]  Continue to speak
[3073.90 --> 3074.46]  Then through
[3074.46 --> 3075.24]  The generations
[3075.24 --> 3077.58]  By his display
[3077.58 --> 3078.68]  Of faith
[3078.68 --> 3081.10]  So this morning
[3081.10 --> 3082.02]  As we dig in
[3082.02 --> 3083.00]  To this faith
[3083.00 --> 3083.52]  Hero
[3083.52 --> 3084.98]  Here's the
[3084.98 --> 3085.96]  Sort of banner
[3085.96 --> 3087.24]  Or the big idea
[3087.24 --> 3087.92]  That I hope
[3087.92 --> 3088.80]  We will see
[3088.80 --> 3091.74]  How Abel
[3091.74 --> 3092.34]  Shows us
[3092.34 --> 3092.64]  That
[3092.64 --> 3093.86]  The attitude
[3093.86 --> 3095.32]  Of our heart
[3095.32 --> 3096.58]  In the approach
[3096.58 --> 3097.30]  To God
[3097.30 --> 3099.00]  Leads directly
[3099.00 --> 3100.46]  To the actions
[3100.46 --> 3101.82]  Of our lives
[3101.82 --> 3102.46]  Towards
[3102.46 --> 3103.96]  Or apart
[3103.96 --> 3104.42]  From
[3104.42 --> 3105.28]  God
[3105.28 --> 3107.52]  I'll say that again
[3107.52 --> 3108.66]  The attitude
[3108.66 --> 3109.52]  Of our heart
[3109.52 --> 3110.48]  In the approach
[3110.48 --> 3111.16]  To God
[3111.16 --> 3112.32]  Leads directly
[3112.32 --> 3113.34]  To the actions
[3113.34 --> 3114.92]  Of our lives
[3114.92 --> 3115.68]  Towards
[3115.68 --> 3116.78]  Or apart
[3116.78 --> 3117.34]  From
[3117.34 --> 3118.40]  God
[3118.40 --> 3121.62]  It's his faith
[3121.62 --> 3123.52]  That is the difference
[3123.52 --> 3125.18]  It's the attitude
[3125.18 --> 3126.04]  Of his heart
[3126.04 --> 3127.14]  That matters
[3127.14 --> 3130.36]  And this makes sense
[3130.36 --> 3132.24]  As we see this theme
[3132.24 --> 3133.54]  Worked out over and over
[3133.54 --> 3134.80]  In the rest of the Old Testament
[3134.80 --> 3136.36]  Even as it regards
[3136.36 --> 3138.16]  The sacrificial system
[3138.16 --> 3139.06]  That will be outlined
[3139.06 --> 3139.80]  In clarity
[3139.80 --> 3141.06]  In the later books
[3141.06 --> 3142.72]  Even as it regards
[3142.72 --> 3144.26]  The covenant marker
[3144.26 --> 3145.26]  Of identity
[3145.26 --> 3146.22]  And inclusion
[3146.22 --> 3147.70]  Like circumcision
[3147.70 --> 3148.66]  That will get
[3148.66 --> 3150.40]  Again outlined for us
[3150.40 --> 3151.08]  Later
[3151.08 --> 3151.92]  But if you look at
[3151.92 --> 3152.98]  Hosea 6
[3152.98 --> 3153.68]  Verse 6
[3153.68 --> 3154.36]  For instance
[3154.36 --> 3154.92]  It says
[3154.92 --> 3155.42]  There
[3155.42 --> 3156.36]  God says
[3156.36 --> 3157.86]  I desire mercy
[3157.86 --> 3159.18]  Not sacrifice
[3159.18 --> 3160.28]  Right
[3160.28 --> 3161.04]  The acknowledgement
[3161.04 --> 3161.86]  Of God
[3161.86 --> 3162.68]  Rather than
[3162.68 --> 3163.52]  Burnt offerings
[3163.52 --> 3165.86]  Or Deuteronomy 30
[3165.86 --> 3166.44]  Verse 6
[3166.44 --> 3166.74]  Says
[3166.74 --> 3168.28]  The Lord your God
[3168.28 --> 3169.48]  Will circumcise
[3169.48 --> 3170.26]  Your hearts
[3170.26 --> 3171.10]  And the hearts
[3171.10 --> 3171.92]  Of your descendants
[3171.92 --> 3173.24]  So that you may
[3173.24 --> 3173.92]  Love him
[3173.92 --> 3175.56]  With all your heart
[3175.56 --> 3177.34]  And with all your soul
[3177.34 --> 3178.44]  And live
[3178.44 --> 3180.12]  Right
[3180.12 --> 3181.46]  The sacrifice itself
[3181.46 --> 3182.68]  Is not the issue
[3182.68 --> 3184.90]  Sacrifice without
[3184.90 --> 3186.58]  Transformed affections
[3186.58 --> 3187.50]  Is
[3187.50 --> 3190.36]  Circumcision itself
[3190.36 --> 3191.52]  Is not the issue
[3191.52 --> 3193.54]  But the act of circumcision
[3193.54 --> 3194.68]  Should be indicative
[3194.68 --> 3197.10]  Of a changed heart
[3197.10 --> 3199.96]  And so with Cain
[3199.96 --> 3201.06]  And Abel
[3201.06 --> 3203.12]  Cain is going through
[3203.12 --> 3204.76]  The religious motions
[3204.76 --> 3206.98]  He's all ritual
[3206.98 --> 3208.66]  And no heart
[3208.66 --> 3210.12]  Abel
[3210.12 --> 3211.04]  His affections
[3211.04 --> 3211.62]  For God
[3211.62 --> 3212.46]  Aren't stirred
[3212.46 --> 3213.40]  Or changed
[3213.40 --> 3214.96]  Abel
[3214.96 --> 3216.02]  On the other hand
[3216.02 --> 3217.20]  Does the religious
[3217.20 --> 3218.40]  Activities
[3218.40 --> 3219.16]  Because
[3219.16 --> 3220.82]  By faith
[3220.82 --> 3222.52]  His affections
[3222.52 --> 3223.60]  His love
[3223.60 --> 3225.02]  Is for
[3225.02 --> 3226.06]  God
[3226.06 --> 3228.48]  Cain is all ritual
[3228.48 --> 3229.32]  And no heart
[3229.32 --> 3231.26]  Abel was all heart
[3231.26 --> 3232.24]  And so
[3232.24 --> 3233.22]  He practices
[3233.22 --> 3233.82]  The ritual
[3233.82 --> 3236.16]  And it's this
[3236.16 --> 3237.40]  Deeper distinction
[3237.40 --> 3239.02]  That the reality
[3239.02 --> 3239.82]  Of our hearts
[3239.82 --> 3240.56]  Affection
[3240.56 --> 3241.60]  That I think
[3241.60 --> 3242.68]  Matters for us
[3242.68 --> 3243.96]  And why Cain
[3243.96 --> 3244.74]  Or why Abel
[3244.74 --> 3245.06]  Sorry
[3245.06 --> 3245.90]  Is held up
[3245.90 --> 3247.06]  As a faith
[3247.06 --> 3247.80]  Hero
[3247.80 --> 3249.20]  Because
[3249.20 --> 3250.94]  Some of us
[3250.94 --> 3252.48]  Are like Cain
[3252.48 --> 3253.68]  In our attitudes
[3253.68 --> 3254.64]  About religion
[3254.64 --> 3256.08]  Right
[3256.08 --> 3257.08]  We are heartless
[3257.08 --> 3258.36]  In our relationship
[3258.36 --> 3259.46]  To God
[3259.46 --> 3260.32]  And God
[3260.32 --> 3261.20]  Doesn't want
[3261.20 --> 3262.12]  A heartless
[3262.12 --> 3263.26]  Relationship
[3263.26 --> 3264.42]  Some of us
[3264.42 --> 3264.74]  Have been
[3264.74 --> 3265.98]  Treating God
[3265.98 --> 3267.00]  As little more
[3267.00 --> 3268.12]  Than an acquaintance
[3268.12 --> 3269.02]  In our lives
[3269.02 --> 3269.98]  Every once in a while
[3269.98 --> 3271.06]  Maybe we say hi
[3271.06 --> 3273.50]  Maybe we talk
[3273.50 --> 3274.50]  A certain way
[3274.50 --> 3276.04]  In certain group settings
[3276.04 --> 3276.92]  So that we appear
[3276.92 --> 3278.22]  To be civil
[3278.22 --> 3279.18]  And polite
[3279.18 --> 3281.08]  But we go for years
[3281.08 --> 3282.86]  Without really
[3282.86 --> 3284.28]  Feeling
[3284.28 --> 3285.52]  Deeply
[3285.52 --> 3288.22]  And maybe that's
[3288.22 --> 3289.78]  Been your approach
[3289.78 --> 3290.66]  To God
[3290.66 --> 3291.28]  Maybe that's been
[3291.28 --> 3292.10]  Your experience
[3292.10 --> 3293.38]  Of religion
[3293.38 --> 3294.24]  In the past
[3294.24 --> 3295.60]  Or even right now
[3295.60 --> 3297.54]  And if that's you
[3297.54 --> 3302.52]  Pick up your ears
[3302.52 --> 3304.22]  Because you are
[3304.22 --> 3305.38]  In the danger zone
[3305.38 --> 3306.54]  Of Cain
[3306.54 --> 3308.68]  Now let me be clear
[3308.68 --> 3309.24]  I've been saying
[3309.24 --> 3310.04]  Some of us
[3310.04 --> 3311.04]  But of course
[3311.04 --> 3311.86]  The truth is
[3311.86 --> 3313.00]  All of us
[3313.00 --> 3314.72]  We all do this
[3314.72 --> 3315.38]  At some point
[3315.38 --> 3316.08]  Or another
[3316.08 --> 3316.74]  We all have
[3316.74 --> 3317.46]  Taken God
[3317.46 --> 3318.28]  For granted
[3318.28 --> 3318.78]  We've all
[3318.78 --> 3319.84]  Minimized God's
[3319.84 --> 3320.88]  Desires for us
[3320.88 --> 3321.36]  We've all
[3321.36 --> 3322.68]  Minimized God's
[3322.68 --> 3324.14]  Call on our lives
[3324.14 --> 3325.30]  To glorify him
[3325.30 --> 3326.16]  And enjoy him
[3326.16 --> 3326.56]  Forever
[3326.56 --> 3327.72]  We have all
[3327.72 --> 3328.74]  Ignored parts
[3328.74 --> 3329.68]  Of his call
[3329.68 --> 3331.02]  That's on every
[3331.02 --> 3332.40]  Corner of our hearts
[3332.40 --> 3333.30]  And every aspect
[3333.30 --> 3334.34]  Of our lives
[3334.34 --> 3334.72]  Right
[3334.72 --> 3335.48]  We've all
[3335.48 --> 3336.92]  Made little
[3336.92 --> 3339.24]  The place of worship
[3339.24 --> 3341.06]  And his word
[3341.06 --> 3342.36]  And devotion
[3342.36 --> 3344.14]  Right
[3344.14 --> 3344.84]  We all
[3344.84 --> 3346.34]  Run the risk
[3346.34 --> 3347.42]  Of the danger zone
[3347.42 --> 3347.92]  Of Cain
[3347.92 --> 3351.70]  Some time ago
[3351.70 --> 3353.48]  I was listening
[3353.48 --> 3355.26]  To what's called
[3355.26 --> 3356.36]  A wreath lecture
[3356.36 --> 3357.54]  It's put on
[3357.54 --> 3358.50]  By the BBC
[3358.50 --> 3360.50]  And historian
[3360.50 --> 3362.16]  Margaret Macmillan
[3362.16 --> 3364.42]  Was talking about
[3364.42 --> 3366.96]  The ubiquity of war
[3366.96 --> 3368.88]  Throughout human history
[3368.88 --> 3370.94]  And she was reflecting
[3370.94 --> 3372.90]  On our seemingly
[3372.90 --> 3374.70]  Complicated relationship
[3374.70 --> 3375.84]  To the history
[3375.84 --> 3376.36]  Of war
[3376.36 --> 3378.26]  Especially as it's
[3378.26 --> 3379.36]  Expressed in art
[3379.36 --> 3380.74]  Right
[3380.74 --> 3381.56]  So on the one hand
[3381.56 --> 3382.32]  We have phrases
[3382.32 --> 3383.60]  Like war is hell
[3383.60 --> 3385.22]  And it's atrocious
[3385.22 --> 3386.00]  And we hate
[3386.00 --> 3386.84]  Every bit of it
[3386.84 --> 3388.64]  And on the other hand
[3388.64 --> 3389.48]  Some of the most
[3389.48 --> 3390.82]  Memorable and amazing
[3390.82 --> 3391.90]  Pieces of art
[3391.90 --> 3392.88]  Throughout history
[3392.88 --> 3393.36]  And culture
[3393.36 --> 3394.16]  Have been created
[3394.16 --> 3395.34]  Around the theme
[3395.34 --> 3396.12]  Of war
[3396.12 --> 3397.20]  Right
[3397.20 --> 3397.66]  Think about
[3397.66 --> 3398.80]  Homer's Iliad
[3398.80 --> 3399.62]  And the story
[3399.62 --> 3400.22]  Of Troy
[3400.22 --> 3400.90]  With Achilles
[3400.90 --> 3401.62]  And Paris
[3401.62 --> 3402.82]  Think about
[3402.82 --> 3403.46]  The famous
[3403.46 --> 3404.34]  Painting of
[3404.34 --> 3405.14]  Napoleon
[3405.14 --> 3405.84]  Rearing up
[3405.84 --> 3406.60]  On horseback
[3406.60 --> 3407.28]  In Napoleon
[3407.28 --> 3408.32]  Crossing the Alps
[3408.32 --> 3409.70]  By Jacques-Louis
[3409.70 --> 3409.92]  David
[3409.92 --> 3411.74]  Or think about
[3411.74 --> 3413.36]  The famous
[3413.36 --> 3414.28]  Statue
[3414.28 --> 3415.34]  Of the U.S.
[3415.50 --> 3416.20]  Marine Corps
[3416.20 --> 3417.30]  With six
[3417.30 --> 3418.36]  American soldiers
[3418.36 --> 3419.46]  Raising the flag
[3419.46 --> 3420.36]  At Iwo Jima
[3420.36 --> 3421.14]  Right
[3421.14 --> 3421.72]  That's a picture
[3421.72 --> 3422.24]  That was turned
[3422.24 --> 3422.88]  Into a statue
[3422.88 --> 3423.58]  That now exists
[3423.58 --> 3424.28]  As a memorial
[3424.28 --> 3425.84]  Right
[3425.84 --> 3426.52]  All of that
[3426.52 --> 3427.82]  Is glorifying
[3427.82 --> 3429.14]  War
[3429.14 --> 3429.84]  And the figures
[3429.84 --> 3430.78]  Of war
[3430.78 --> 3432.74]  Now what interests me
[3432.74 --> 3433.46]  From her lecture
[3433.46 --> 3434.40]  And why it applies here
[3434.40 --> 3435.20]  Is that the title
[3435.20 --> 3436.12]  Of her lecture
[3436.12 --> 3437.26]  Was called
[3437.26 --> 3438.72]  The Mark of Cain
[3438.72 --> 3440.94]  And she's picking up
[3440.94 --> 3442.52]  On verse 15
[3442.52 --> 3444.06]  Of this text
[3444.06 --> 3444.40]  Right
[3444.40 --> 3446.20]  Where then the Lord
[3446.20 --> 3447.52]  Put a mark on Cain
[3447.52 --> 3448.90]  So that no one
[3448.90 --> 3449.72]  Who found him
[3449.72 --> 3450.86]  Would kill him
[3450.86 --> 3451.68]  Because Cain
[3451.68 --> 3452.08]  Of course
[3452.08 --> 3452.90]  Is terrified
[3452.90 --> 3454.30]  That as he's hidden
[3454.30 --> 3455.42]  From God's presence
[3455.42 --> 3456.24]  As he's a restless
[3456.24 --> 3457.04]  Wanderer on earth
[3457.04 --> 3458.22]  Whoever finds him
[3458.22 --> 3459.40]  Will kill him
[3459.40 --> 3460.70]  So her idea
[3460.70 --> 3461.58]  Is that the Mark
[3461.58 --> 3462.28]  Of Cain
[3462.28 --> 3463.22]  Is the legacy
[3463.22 --> 3463.96]  Of war
[3463.96 --> 3465.74]  Brother against brother
[3465.74 --> 3466.88]  Nation against nation
[3466.88 --> 3469.96]  But I think
[3469.96 --> 3471.14]  In this story
[3471.14 --> 3472.26]  The real Mark
[3472.26 --> 3473.02]  Of Cain
[3473.02 --> 3474.92]  Is treating God
[3474.92 --> 3475.46]  Flippantly
[3475.46 --> 3477.94]  That the real Mark
[3477.94 --> 3478.64]  Of Cain
[3478.64 --> 3480.42]  Is an affectionless
[3480.42 --> 3481.06]  Approach
[3481.06 --> 3481.72]  To God
[3481.72 --> 3482.66]  Or an apathy
[3482.66 --> 3483.82]  Towards God
[3483.82 --> 3485.28]  That's the problem
[3485.28 --> 3485.96]  That Cain
[3485.96 --> 3487.06]  Introduces
[3487.06 --> 3488.32]  And when we start
[3488.32 --> 3489.12]  To approach
[3489.12 --> 3490.38]  God that way
[3490.38 --> 3492.62]  We're opening
[3492.62 --> 3493.64]  Ourselves to something
[3493.64 --> 3495.28]  We become vulnerable
[3495.28 --> 3496.38]  To something
[3496.38 --> 3497.08]  Whether it's because
[3497.08 --> 3498.34]  Our faith becomes weak
[3498.34 --> 3499.40]  Or we miss
[3499.40 --> 3500.22]  The consequences
[3500.22 --> 3501.28]  Of what's going on
[3501.28 --> 3502.46]  And we are rejecting
[3502.46 --> 3503.46]  The reality
[3503.46 --> 3504.82]  Of who God is
[3504.82 --> 3506.44]  In a word
[3506.44 --> 3507.18]  What this text
[3507.18 --> 3508.00]  Is telling us
[3508.00 --> 3508.82]  Is that we become
[3508.82 --> 3509.60]  Vulnerable
[3509.60 --> 3511.06]  To sin
[3511.06 --> 3513.68]  Right God says
[3513.68 --> 3515.00]  To Cain
[3515.00 --> 3516.16]  If you do not
[3516.16 --> 3517.18]  What is right
[3517.18 --> 3518.80]  Sin is crouching
[3518.80 --> 3519.52]  At your door
[3519.52 --> 3520.58]  It desires
[3520.58 --> 3521.42]  To have you
[3521.42 --> 3522.60]  But you must
[3522.60 --> 3523.96]  Rule over it
[3523.96 --> 3526.32]  A previous translation
[3526.32 --> 3527.06]  Of that verse
[3527.06 --> 3527.76]  Says you must
[3527.76 --> 3529.36]  Master it
[3529.36 --> 3531.42]  It's a remarkable
[3531.42 --> 3532.06]  Image
[3532.06 --> 3532.82]  I think
[3532.82 --> 3534.12]  Right it's an image
[3534.12 --> 3534.76]  Of a leopard
[3534.76 --> 3536.00]  Or a tiger
[3536.00 --> 3536.90]  Or some sort
[3536.90 --> 3538.78]  Of predatory animal
[3538.78 --> 3540.18]  Stalking through
[3540.18 --> 3541.06]  The grass
[3541.06 --> 3543.08]  Crouching in the shadows
[3543.08 --> 3544.74]  Muscles taut
[3544.74 --> 3546.22]  Ready to spring
[3546.22 --> 3547.10]  And kill
[3547.10 --> 3549.88]  God says that's sin
[3549.88 --> 3552.40]  Sin is predatory
[3552.40 --> 3555.26]  Sin has a deadly effect
[3555.26 --> 3556.58]  In the life
[3556.58 --> 3557.48]  And in a life
[3557.48 --> 3558.08]  Of its own
[3558.08 --> 3560.42]  How is that?
[3561.90 --> 3563.08]  And here is why
[3563.08 --> 3563.86]  I think we're going
[3563.86 --> 3564.92]  To begin to see
[3564.92 --> 3567.02]  That there's no other
[3567.02 --> 3568.96]  Way to describe
[3568.96 --> 3570.10]  This reality
[3570.10 --> 3570.96]  Than what the Bible
[3570.96 --> 3571.54]  Gives us
[3571.54 --> 3572.94]  That is as effective
[3572.94 --> 3574.16]  For understanding
[3574.16 --> 3575.28]  What's taking place
[3575.28 --> 3576.72]  Because like
[3576.72 --> 3577.48]  When God uses
[3577.48 --> 3578.48]  This image
[3578.48 --> 3580.34]  He's telling us
[3580.34 --> 3581.60]  That sin
[3581.60 --> 3582.84]  Seems to have
[3582.84 --> 3583.74]  This kind of like
[3583.74 --> 3584.78]  Abiding
[3584.78 --> 3585.88]  And growing
[3585.88 --> 3586.94]  Presence
[3586.94 --> 3587.66]  In your life
[3587.66 --> 3589.70]  Right
[3589.70 --> 3590.56]  If you commit
[3590.56 --> 3591.18]  A sin
[3591.18 --> 3593.66]  Sin is not over
[3593.66 --> 3595.04]  Right
[3595.04 --> 3596.06]  Sin's not simply
[3596.06 --> 3596.96]  An action
[3596.96 --> 3598.22]  It's a force
[3598.22 --> 3599.98]  It's a desire
[3599.98 --> 3601.26]  It's a power
[3601.26 --> 3604.46]  And when you do sin
[3604.46 --> 3605.66]  And it's not over
[3605.66 --> 3607.52]  It actually becomes
[3607.52 --> 3608.96]  A presence
[3608.96 --> 3610.06]  In your life
[3610.06 --> 3610.36]  And it
[3610.36 --> 3611.34]  It takes on
[3611.34 --> 3612.44]  This shape
[3612.44 --> 3613.84]  A shadowy shape
[3613.84 --> 3614.60]  And it begins
[3614.60 --> 3616.24]  To stay with you
[3616.24 --> 3616.72]  And it begins
[3616.72 --> 3617.98]  To affect you
[3617.98 --> 3619.00]  Or infect you
[3619.00 --> 3620.94]  And eventually
[3620.94 --> 3621.84]  What we're being
[3621.84 --> 3622.60]  Warned of here
[3622.60 --> 3624.02]  Is that it'll
[3624.02 --> 3624.86]  Take you out
[3624.86 --> 3626.52]  Now you say
[3626.52 --> 3627.22]  How can that be
[3627.22 --> 3628.72]  Well
[3628.72 --> 3629.78]  Let's start
[3629.78 --> 3630.70]  With a parallel
[3630.70 --> 3632.22]  Concept in psychology
[3632.22 --> 3633.72]  This idea of habit
[3633.72 --> 3634.82]  Right
[3634.82 --> 3635.60]  You can start there
[3635.60 --> 3636.50]  But don't end there
[3636.50 --> 3637.88]  You can start by noticing
[3637.88 --> 3638.92]  That things become
[3638.92 --> 3640.10]  Easier to do
[3640.10 --> 3641.28]  When you do them
[3641.28 --> 3642.30]  Over and over again
[3642.30 --> 3644.96]  Right
[3644.96 --> 3646.72]  The more you do something
[3646.72 --> 3647.64]  The harder it is
[3647.64 --> 3648.74]  To stop doing that thing
[3648.74 --> 3650.76]  There's all sorts
[3650.76 --> 3651.88]  Of neurological things
[3651.88 --> 3652.90]  Going on in our brains
[3652.90 --> 3653.92]  That create pathways
[3653.92 --> 3655.18]  And quick fire receptors
[3655.18 --> 3657.14]  But the more you do something
[3657.14 --> 3658.64]  The easier it is to do it
[3658.64 --> 3660.14]  Sin is the same way
[3660.14 --> 3662.92]  There's a place
[3662.92 --> 3664.76]  In the book
[3664.76 --> 3665.60]  Mere Christianity
[3665.60 --> 3666.70]  By C.S. Lewis
[3666.70 --> 3670.66]  Where C.S. Lewis
[3670.66 --> 3672.92]  Makes the interesting observation
[3672.92 --> 3675.68]  Reflecting on
[3675.68 --> 3677.92]  A post-World War II
[3677.92 --> 3679.50]  Experience
[3679.50 --> 3680.70]  And looking at
[3680.70 --> 3681.74]  What took place
[3681.74 --> 3682.96]  During World War II
[3682.96 --> 3684.70]  He says
[3684.70 --> 3685.42]  At first
[3685.42 --> 3686.22]  The Nazis
[3686.22 --> 3687.26]  Killed the Jews
[3687.26 --> 3688.82]  Because they hated them
[3688.82 --> 3691.12]  After a while
[3691.12 --> 3692.86]  They hated the Jews
[3692.86 --> 3694.38]  Because they killed them
[3694.38 --> 3696.50]  Right
[3696.50 --> 3697.30]  His point
[3697.30 --> 3697.92]  Is that
[3697.92 --> 3699.12]  That when you sin
[3699.12 --> 3700.74]  Sin doesn't just go away
[3700.74 --> 3701.84]  It becomes a presence
[3701.84 --> 3702.64]  In your life
[3702.64 --> 3704.52]  You start by doing sin
[3704.52 --> 3705.72]  And then sin
[3705.72 --> 3706.72]  Does you
[3706.72 --> 3709.28]  Right
[3709.28 --> 3710.14]  You can decide
[3710.14 --> 3710.78]  You know
[3710.78 --> 3711.36]  In a moment
[3711.36 --> 3713.06]  I'm not going to forgive
[3713.06 --> 3713.98]  My mother
[3713.98 --> 3714.96]  I'm not going to forgive
[3714.96 --> 3715.68]  My father
[3715.68 --> 3716.76]  For what he or she
[3716.76 --> 3717.32]  Has done
[3717.32 --> 3719.04]  And then you've
[3719.04 --> 3720.06]  Made that decision
[3720.06 --> 3720.98]  You've decided it
[3720.98 --> 3721.80]  But then
[3721.80 --> 3722.76]  Notice where
[3722.76 --> 3723.52]  It will do
[3723.52 --> 3724.18]  You
[3724.18 --> 3726.36]  Because not forgiving
[3726.36 --> 3726.80]  Your mother
[3726.80 --> 3727.50]  Or your father
[3727.50 --> 3728.10]  Or whomever
[3728.10 --> 3728.78]  In your life
[3728.78 --> 3729.66]  Is going to have
[3729.66 --> 3730.48]  The effect of
[3730.48 --> 3731.40]  Poisoning
[3731.40 --> 3732.22]  Or infecting
[3732.22 --> 3733.28]  Other relationships
[3733.28 --> 3734.90]  In your life
[3734.90 --> 3736.80]  Other people
[3736.80 --> 3737.68]  Are going to begin
[3737.68 --> 3738.92]  To feel the sting
[3738.92 --> 3740.70]  Of your unforgiveness
[3740.70 --> 3742.92]  Right
[3742.92 --> 3744.00]  It will harden you
[3744.00 --> 3745.56]  To them
[3745.56 --> 3747.78]  And you can see that
[3747.78 --> 3748.12]  Actually
[3748.12 --> 3749.34]  Already in this
[3749.34 --> 3750.22]  Little family
[3750.22 --> 3750.94]  Right
[3750.94 --> 3751.54]  Adam and Eve
[3751.54 --> 3752.02]  And Cain
[3752.02 --> 3752.86]  And Abel
[3752.86 --> 3754.26]  When God comes
[3754.26 --> 3755.14]  To Adam and Eve
[3755.14 --> 3756.08]  In Genesis 3
[3756.08 --> 3756.92]  In the fall
[3756.92 --> 3757.22]  Right
[3757.22 --> 3757.72]  And they say
[3757.72 --> 3758.88]  What have you done
[3758.88 --> 3760.02]  Right
[3760.02 --> 3761.26]  They feel ashamed
[3761.26 --> 3762.78]  And they hide
[3762.78 --> 3764.14]  Right
[3764.14 --> 3765.20]  They feel sheepish
[3765.20 --> 3766.50]  And then Adam says
[3766.50 --> 3767.42]  Well my wife
[3767.42 --> 3768.20]  Made me do it
[3768.20 --> 3770.34]  And then the woman says
[3770.34 --> 3771.20]  Well the serpent
[3771.20 --> 3772.10]  Made me do it
[3772.10 --> 3773.74]  But here
[3773.74 --> 3774.86]  God comes to Cain
[3774.86 --> 3775.40]  And he asks
[3775.40 --> 3776.62]  Effectively the same question
[3776.62 --> 3776.84]  He says
[3776.84 --> 3777.58]  What have you done
[3777.58 --> 3779.04]  And he says
[3779.04 --> 3780.34]  Am I supposed
[3780.34 --> 3781.54]  To take care of that guy
[3781.54 --> 3783.18]  Right
[3783.18 --> 3784.44]  Am I my brother's keeper
[3784.44 --> 3786.58]  There's a hardening
[3786.58 --> 3788.26]  That has taken place
[3788.26 --> 3790.70]  First you start to sin
[3790.70 --> 3791.62]  And then sin
[3791.62 --> 3792.72]  Does you
[3792.72 --> 3794.10]  It becomes a presence
[3794.10 --> 3795.16]  In your life
[3795.16 --> 3797.98]  And when you sin
[3797.98 --> 3799.54]  When that sin
[3799.54 --> 3800.42]  Becomes a presence
[3800.42 --> 3801.04]  In your life
[3801.04 --> 3802.24]  It takes shape
[3802.24 --> 3802.94]  In you
[3802.94 --> 3804.10]  And around you
[3804.10 --> 3804.92]  And eventually
[3804.92 --> 3807.36]  Like a crouching
[3807.36 --> 3809.18]  Predatory animal
[3809.18 --> 3810.86]  It will take you out
[3810.86 --> 3814.98]  So you should avoid sin
[3814.98 --> 3816.04]  Like the plague
[3816.04 --> 3817.00]  Because it's
[3817.00 --> 3817.78]  A plague
[3817.78 --> 3820.42]  And somebody
[3820.42 --> 3821.46]  Might say to you
[3821.46 --> 3822.38]  You know
[3822.38 --> 3823.40]  You have a
[3823.40 --> 3824.38]  Cancerous tumor
[3824.38 --> 3825.12]  That is growing
[3825.12 --> 3826.36]  In part of your body
[3826.36 --> 3828.92]  You shouldn't respond
[3828.92 --> 3829.30]  And say
[3829.30 --> 3829.80]  Yeah you know
[3829.80 --> 3830.50]  One of these days
[3830.50 --> 3831.18]  I'll get to it
[3831.18 --> 3832.82]  Maybe in a few years
[3832.82 --> 3833.84]  I'll deal with it
[3833.84 --> 3835.18]  Right
[3835.18 --> 3836.14]  You don't do that
[3836.14 --> 3837.44]  Likewise
[3837.44 --> 3838.64]  If someone comes to you
[3838.64 --> 3839.04]  And says
[3839.04 --> 3839.98]  You know what
[3839.98 --> 3842.66]  I'll say it politely
[3842.66 --> 3844.56]  You have an abrasive spirit
[3844.56 --> 3846.62]  That's not how we talk
[3846.62 --> 3847.24]  You know how someone
[3847.24 --> 3848.12]  Might say that to you
[3848.12 --> 3849.54]  Right
[3849.54 --> 3850.48]  Someone might come to you
[3850.48 --> 3850.84]  And say
[3850.84 --> 3851.60]  You know what
[3851.60 --> 3853.38]  You can't control yourself
[3853.38 --> 3855.08]  In this area
[3855.08 --> 3855.98]  Or that area
[3855.98 --> 3858.64]  And if you say
[3858.64 --> 3859.00]  Yeah
[3859.00 --> 3859.80]  You're right
[3859.80 --> 3861.74]  And then just walk away
[3861.74 --> 3863.44]  As if nothing's going on
[3863.44 --> 3866.32]  You're missing the danger
[3866.32 --> 3868.86]  Of this sin thing
[3868.86 --> 3870.16]  That is crouching
[3870.16 --> 3871.88]  Waiting to devour you
[3871.88 --> 3873.34]  And don't dare
[3873.34 --> 3874.22]  Just walk away
[3874.22 --> 3875.50]  Right
[3875.50 --> 3877.06]  That this idea of sin
[3877.06 --> 3878.32]  Crouching at the door
[3878.32 --> 3878.90]  Tells us
[3878.90 --> 3879.80]  Not only that it's
[3879.80 --> 3881.14]  A coiled spring
[3881.14 --> 3882.00]  It's a presence
[3882.00 --> 3882.88]  In your life
[3882.88 --> 3883.64]  Right
[3883.64 --> 3884.52]  But it's also
[3884.52 --> 3885.92]  It gets to the fact
[3885.92 --> 3886.82]  That sin
[3886.82 --> 3887.96]  Hides
[3887.96 --> 3889.18]  In you
[3889.18 --> 3890.72]  Right
[3890.72 --> 3891.26]  The lion
[3891.26 --> 3891.94]  Or the tiger
[3891.94 --> 3894.10]  Or this predatory image
[3894.10 --> 3895.58]  It's crouching
[3895.58 --> 3898.12]  That means it's down
[3898.12 --> 3898.62]  Away
[3898.62 --> 3899.68]  Out of your sight
[3899.68 --> 3901.78]  Right
[3901.78 --> 3902.34]  And that's important
[3902.34 --> 3903.68]  Because if you see
[3903.68 --> 3905.08]  A crouching tiger
[3905.08 --> 3907.52]  You can respond
[3907.52 --> 3908.98]  You can maybe
[3908.98 --> 3909.68]  Get out of the way
[3909.68 --> 3910.62]  You can try to run
[3910.62 --> 3913.00]  But if you don't see it
[3913.00 --> 3916.04]  That's how you end up dead
[3916.04 --> 3919.60]  And so see it
[3919.60 --> 3921.82]  See it
[3921.82 --> 3925.18]  And so that means
[3925.18 --> 3927.84]  That the biggest struggles
[3927.84 --> 3928.68]  In your life
[3928.68 --> 3929.36]  Right now
[3929.36 --> 3931.48]  The character flaws
[3931.48 --> 3933.12]  The abrasive spirit
[3933.12 --> 3933.90]  Right
[3933.90 --> 3935.02]  The things in your life
[3935.02 --> 3936.06]  That are most likely
[3936.06 --> 3937.12]  To ruin you
[3937.12 --> 3938.38]  Or are currently
[3938.38 --> 3939.48]  Ruining you
[3939.48 --> 3940.94]  And ruining your relationships
[3940.94 --> 3943.10]  The things in your life
[3943.10 --> 3943.94]  That are most likely
[3943.94 --> 3944.82]  To make the people
[3944.82 --> 3946.10]  Around you miserable
[3946.10 --> 3948.20]  Are the things
[3948.20 --> 3949.56]  The character flaws
[3949.56 --> 3951.50]  That you are least likely
[3951.50 --> 3952.28]  To admit
[3952.28 --> 3954.24]  And least likely
[3954.24 --> 3955.02]  To see
[3955.02 --> 3956.68]  In your own life
[3956.68 --> 3960.00]  They're the ones
[3960.00 --> 3961.20]  That you're in denial of
[3961.20 --> 3962.44]  They're the ones
[3962.44 --> 3963.54]  That you rationalize
[3963.54 --> 3964.22]  Away
[3964.22 --> 3964.68]  They're the ones
[3964.68 --> 3965.36]  That you minimize
[3965.36 --> 3965.82]  Right
[3965.82 --> 3967.20]  Whenever the consequences
[3967.20 --> 3967.86]  Of those things
[3967.86 --> 3968.54]  Happen to you
[3968.54 --> 3969.68]  When somebody brings them up
[3969.68 --> 3971.00]  You just explain it away
[3971.00 --> 3972.98]  The most dangerous
[3972.98 --> 3974.42]  Struggles you face
[3974.42 --> 3975.12]  Are the ones
[3975.12 --> 3976.80]  That you cannot see
[3976.80 --> 3980.14]  By definition
[3980.14 --> 3982.10]  Those are the sins
[3982.10 --> 3983.10]  That are crouching
[3983.10 --> 3983.94]  In your life
[3983.94 --> 3986.92]  So by way of example here
[3986.92 --> 3989.20]  As long as you think
[3989.20 --> 3991.58]  Of your addiction to work
[3991.58 --> 3993.18]  Your workaholism
[3993.18 --> 3994.80]  As long as you think of that
[3994.80 --> 3996.22]  As a strong work ethic
[3996.22 --> 3999.02]  You're in the danger zone
[3999.02 --> 4002.10]  As long as you look at
[4002.10 --> 4004.38]  Materialism
[4004.38 --> 4006.12]  As ambition
[4006.12 --> 4006.14]  As ambition
[4006.14 --> 4008.84]  You're in the danger zone
[4008.84 --> 4010.96]  As long as you think
[4010.96 --> 4011.94]  Of your arrogance
[4011.94 --> 4014.48]  As a healthy self-assertion
[4014.48 --> 4016.62]  You're in the danger zone
[4016.62 --> 4017.60]  Right
[4017.60 --> 4018.82]  As long as you justify
[4018.82 --> 4019.72]  Your obsession
[4019.72 --> 4021.24]  With good looks
[4021.24 --> 4022.40]  As good grooming
[4022.40 --> 4024.44]  You're vulnerable
[4024.44 --> 4026.46]  You're in denial
[4026.46 --> 4029.80]  This is the power
[4029.80 --> 4031.30]  Of sin
[4031.30 --> 4033.32]  And why it is so deadly
[4033.32 --> 4034.70]  And why it's something
[4034.70 --> 4036.88]  We cannot take lightly
[4036.88 --> 4040.34]  And how then
[4040.34 --> 4042.94]  The attitude of our heart
[4042.94 --> 4044.38]  In our approach to God
[4044.38 --> 4045.78]  Is directly related
[4045.78 --> 4046.98]  To the actions
[4046.98 --> 4048.24]  Of our lives
[4048.24 --> 4050.54]  With or without God
[4050.54 --> 4051.76]  Right
[4051.76 --> 4052.46]  Cain is overtaken
[4052.46 --> 4053.18]  Overtaken
[4053.18 --> 4054.76]  By the power of sin
[4054.76 --> 4055.66]  In his life
[4055.66 --> 4056.86]  And he kills his brother
[4056.86 --> 4059.28]  And now
[4059.28 --> 4060.48]  Abel's blood
[4060.48 --> 4061.18]  God says
[4061.18 --> 4062.36]  Cries out
[4062.36 --> 4063.86]  For justice
[4063.86 --> 4067.74]  But this story
[4067.74 --> 4069.12]  Isn't over
[4069.12 --> 4070.94]  Because you see
[4070.94 --> 4072.12]  Years later
[4072.12 --> 4074.58]  Another innocent man
[4074.58 --> 4075.66]  Would be slain
[4075.66 --> 4076.68]  By his brothers
[4076.68 --> 4078.90]  Years later
[4078.90 --> 4080.94]  Others sin
[4080.94 --> 4082.30]  Would put Jesus
[4082.30 --> 4084.68]  Up on the cross
[4084.68 --> 4086.12]  Another innocent man
[4086.12 --> 4088.42]  Whose blood cries out
[4088.42 --> 4089.58]  And Jesus Christ
[4089.58 --> 4090.82]  Now is standing
[4090.82 --> 4092.12]  Before the throne
[4092.12 --> 4093.28]  Of his father in heaven
[4093.28 --> 4093.82]  And he says
[4093.82 --> 4094.50]  Father
[4094.50 --> 4096.84]  Your law demands justice
[4096.84 --> 4098.60]  These people have sinned
[4098.60 --> 4099.98]  The wages of sin
[4099.98 --> 4100.90]  Is death
[4100.90 --> 4102.58]  But for all who believe
[4102.58 --> 4103.26]  In me
[4103.26 --> 4104.12]  Says Jesus
[4104.12 --> 4105.46]  I have paid
[4105.46 --> 4107.18]  That penalty
[4107.18 --> 4109.26]  My blood
[4109.26 --> 4111.00]  Is now crying out
[4111.00 --> 4112.04]  For justice
[4112.04 --> 4113.10]  And it cries
[4113.10 --> 4114.62]  Justice demands
[4114.62 --> 4116.18]  That you never condemn
[4116.18 --> 4117.78]  My brothers
[4117.78 --> 4118.84]  And sisters
[4118.84 --> 4120.40]  The blood of Jesus
[4120.40 --> 4121.62]  Now cries out
[4121.62 --> 4122.38]  Grace
[4122.38 --> 4123.14]  For you
[4123.14 --> 4124.08]  And for me
[4124.08 --> 4126.42]  And because his blood
[4126.42 --> 4127.54]  Cries out grace
[4127.54 --> 4129.10]  Because he has extended
[4129.10 --> 4129.78]  That grace
[4129.78 --> 4131.06]  By faith to us
[4131.06 --> 4132.08]  Instead of
[4132.08 --> 4133.22]  Empty affection
[4133.22 --> 4134.50]  It's hearts
[4134.50 --> 4135.68]  Full of praise
[4135.68 --> 4136.90]  Instead of sin
[4136.90 --> 4138.34]  Crouching at your door
[4138.34 --> 4139.18]  Worship
[4139.18 --> 4140.90]  Now pours out
[4140.90 --> 4142.72]  Of your heart
[4142.72 --> 4145.32]  And that's why
[4145.32 --> 4146.52]  We come to church
[4146.52 --> 4147.34]  Every week
[4147.34 --> 4150.18]  To have our blind eyes
[4150.18 --> 4151.64]  Opened to the truth
[4151.64 --> 4152.60]  Of what's actually
[4152.60 --> 4153.62]  Going on out here
[4153.62 --> 4155.32]  To the truth
[4155.32 --> 4157.06]  Of what's really dangerous
[4157.06 --> 4159.46]  To have our dead hearts
[4159.46 --> 4160.88]  Stirred to life
[4160.88 --> 4161.74]  By word
[4161.74 --> 4162.86]  And by worship
[4162.86 --> 4164.42]  Precisely because
[4164.42 --> 4166.08]  Sin is hiding
[4166.08 --> 4167.22]  And it desires
[4167.22 --> 4168.18]  To have you
[4168.18 --> 4169.62]  You need to come
[4169.62 --> 4171.28]  And find God
[4171.28 --> 4172.12]  You need to come
[4172.12 --> 4173.02]  And be found
[4173.02 --> 4174.40]  By him
[4174.40 --> 4177.40]  You need to come
[4177.40 --> 4179.14]  And worship
[4179.14 --> 4185.74]  When I think about
[4185.74 --> 4188.40]  The people in my life
[4188.40 --> 4190.06]  Who have
[4190.06 --> 4190.08]  Who have
[4190.08 --> 4191.36]  Helped me
[4191.36 --> 4192.44]  See what
[4192.44 --> 4193.66]  Genuine affection
[4193.66 --> 4194.92]  For worship
[4194.92 --> 4195.98]  And in worship
[4195.98 --> 4197.04]  Looks like
[4197.04 --> 4200.76]  I can't help
[4200.76 --> 4202.50]  But think of my grandpa
[4202.50 --> 4205.26]  And my grandpa
[4205.26 --> 4207.88]  Was a
[4207.88 --> 4208.86]  Dutch immigrant
[4208.86 --> 4211.42]  Who was not a hand raiser
[4211.42 --> 4212.20]  In worship
[4212.20 --> 4213.96]  He was not
[4213.96 --> 4216.46]  A bouncer
[4216.46 --> 4217.30]  On the balls
[4217.30 --> 4217.88]  Of his feet
[4217.88 --> 4218.90]  As he worshipped
[4218.90 --> 4219.56]  He was not one
[4219.56 --> 4220.20]  Of those ones
[4220.20 --> 4220.92]  Who tried to like
[4220.92 --> 4221.82]  Hide their hands
[4221.82 --> 4222.30]  In worship
[4222.30 --> 4222.78]  You know
[4222.78 --> 4223.82]  They were like
[4223.82 --> 4224.68]  Maybe today
[4224.68 --> 4225.60]  That was not him
[4225.60 --> 4226.22]  My grandpa
[4226.22 --> 4227.92]  Was super conservative
[4227.92 --> 4229.64]  Right
[4229.64 --> 4230.86]  He was part
[4230.86 --> 4231.70]  Of a church tradition
[4231.70 --> 4232.90]  That sang only
[4232.90 --> 4233.52]  With organs
[4233.52 --> 4234.16]  And usually
[4234.16 --> 4235.42]  Only genevan psalms
[4235.42 --> 4238.30]  And
[4238.30 --> 4239.54]  If you
[4239.54 --> 4240.32]  Are honest
[4240.32 --> 4241.14]  About who my grandpa
[4241.14 --> 4241.52]  Is
[4241.52 --> 4243.14]  My dad will agree
[4243.14 --> 4243.46]  With this
[4243.46 --> 4244.12]  More than my mom
[4244.12 --> 4244.40]  Maybe
[4244.40 --> 4244.90]  But he was
[4244.90 --> 4245.44]  Pretty stubborn
[4245.44 --> 4245.96]  Sometimes
[4245.96 --> 4247.66]  He wasn't always
[4247.66 --> 4248.16]  The easiest
[4248.16 --> 4249.06]  To get along with
[4249.06 --> 4252.68]  But when you
[4252.68 --> 4253.54]  Stood beside him
[4253.54 --> 4254.18]  In church
[4254.18 --> 4256.80]  When you looked
[4256.80 --> 4257.62]  At his face
[4257.62 --> 4259.84]  As he worshipped
[4259.84 --> 4262.12]  His was a heart
[4262.12 --> 4263.38]  Full of affection
[4263.38 --> 4264.64]  For Jesus
[4264.64 --> 4266.80]  And I remember
[4266.80 --> 4267.12]  That
[4267.12 --> 4268.26]  I remember
[4268.26 --> 4269.84]  My grandmother's
[4269.84 --> 4270.24]  Funeral
[4270.24 --> 4271.78]  I was in
[4271.78 --> 4272.36]  Grade 12
[4272.36 --> 4275.60]  And we sang
[4275.60 --> 4276.76]  Great is thy
[4276.76 --> 4277.30]  Faithfulness
[4277.30 --> 4278.46]  If you know
[4278.46 --> 4279.00]  That song
[4279.00 --> 4280.52]  You can understand
[4280.52 --> 4281.06]  The connection
[4281.06 --> 4281.58]  If you don't
[4281.58 --> 4282.10]  Know the song
[4282.10 --> 4283.28]  The last verse
[4283.28 --> 4284.10]  Says
[4284.10 --> 4285.70]  Pardon for sin
[4285.70 --> 4286.50]  And a peace
[4286.50 --> 4287.70]  That endureth
[4287.70 --> 4288.90]  Thine own dear
[4288.90 --> 4289.80]  Presence to cheer
[4289.80 --> 4290.46]  And to guide
[4290.46 --> 4291.60]  Strength
[4291.60 --> 4292.74]  For today
[4292.74 --> 4294.18]  And bright hope
[4294.18 --> 4295.40]  For tomorrow
[4295.40 --> 4298.00]  Blessings all mine
[4298.00 --> 4299.68]  With 10,000 beside
[4299.68 --> 4301.56]  Here we are
[4301.56 --> 4302.26]  At the funeral
[4302.26 --> 4303.34]  Of his wife
[4303.34 --> 4305.48]  And he sang
[4305.48 --> 4306.18]  This song
[4306.18 --> 4307.96]  With conviction
[4307.96 --> 4310.12]  And with dedication
[4310.12 --> 4311.56]  And maybe
[4311.56 --> 4313.56]  Not so much
[4313.56 --> 4314.80]  This I believe
[4314.80 --> 4316.14]  But this I want
[4316.14 --> 4317.90]  To live out of
[4317.90 --> 4320.36]  And I will
[4320.36 --> 4321.04]  Never forget
[4321.04 --> 4322.94]  Looking at him
[4322.94 --> 4325.32]  And seeing that
[4325.32 --> 4327.26]  There he stood
[4327.26 --> 4328.34]  Solid
[4328.34 --> 4329.66]  As a rock
[4329.66 --> 4330.84]  Unmoving
[4330.84 --> 4331.82]  In his person
[4331.82 --> 4335.72]  But looking
[4335.72 --> 4337.88]  To Jesus
[4337.88 --> 4339.62]  True worship
[4339.62 --> 4341.60]  And I could see it
[4341.60 --> 4343.82]  Like Abel
[4343.82 --> 4345.58]  My grandfather's story
[4345.58 --> 4346.70]  In that moment
[4346.70 --> 4347.60]  Is one that
[4347.60 --> 4348.60]  Helps me see
[4348.60 --> 4349.50]  What genuine
[4349.50 --> 4350.48]  Affection
[4350.48 --> 4351.38]  In worship
[4351.38 --> 4352.42]  Looks like
[4352.42 --> 4354.08]  And his story
[4354.08 --> 4355.68]  Has changed me
[4355.68 --> 4357.88]  So I want to ask you
[4357.88 --> 4360.24]  Who are the people
[4360.24 --> 4362.20]  In your life
[4362.20 --> 4363.94]  Whose stories
[4363.94 --> 4365.28]  Have changed you
[4365.28 --> 4366.18]  Whose stories
[4366.18 --> 4367.58]  Whose lives
[4367.58 --> 4368.82]  Have shown you
[4368.82 --> 4369.72]  What genuine
[4369.72 --> 4370.44]  Affection
[4370.44 --> 4371.36]  In worship
[4371.36 --> 4372.36]  Looks like
[4372.36 --> 4373.76]  Who has helped
[4373.76 --> 4374.78]  You learn
[4374.78 --> 4375.88]  How to worship
[4375.88 --> 4376.40]  God
[4376.40 --> 4378.30]  Well and rightly
[4378.30 --> 4380.72]  And then maybe
[4380.72 --> 4382.40]  Over lunch today
[4382.40 --> 4384.24]  Or in this evening
[4384.24 --> 4385.36]  Or sometime
[4385.36 --> 4386.30]  Throughout this week
[4386.30 --> 4387.80]  Talk with your people
[4387.80 --> 4389.56]  Right
[4389.56 --> 4390.54]  Talk with your friends
[4390.54 --> 4392.12]  Talk with your care groups
[4392.12 --> 4393.44]  Talk with your families
[4393.44 --> 4393.64]  Right
[4393.64 --> 4394.54]  Whoever it is
[4394.54 --> 4395.14]  That has helped
[4395.14 --> 4396.40]  Shape the attitude
[4396.40 --> 4397.46]  Of your heart
[4397.46 --> 4398.10]  When it comes
[4398.10 --> 4399.28]  To worshiping God
[4399.28 --> 4400.44]  Talk to them
[4400.44 --> 4402.74]  Share that
[4402.74 --> 4403.94]  With the people
[4403.94 --> 4404.62]  Around you
[4404.62 --> 4407.08]  And then
[4407.08 --> 4408.48]  Wonder together
[4408.48 --> 4410.16]  How
[4410.16 --> 4412.52]  How can God
[4412.52 --> 4413.52]  Use me
[4413.52 --> 4415.34]  Like he used
[4415.34 --> 4415.72]  Abel
[4415.72 --> 4417.12]  Like he used
[4417.12 --> 4417.84]  My grandfather
[4417.84 --> 4419.52]  To lead others
[4419.52 --> 4420.64]  To this genuine
[4420.64 --> 4422.22]  Affection
[4422.22 --> 4423.50]  For Jesus
[4423.50 --> 4424.74]  In worship
[4424.74 --> 4426.70]  At this point
[4426.70 --> 4427.24]  I'm going to invite
[4427.24 --> 4427.90]  The worship team
[4427.90 --> 4428.44]  To come back
[4428.44 --> 4429.24]  Up to the front
[4429.24 --> 4430.82]  We are going to
[4430.82 --> 4431.74]  Stand and sing
[4431.74 --> 4432.18]  Together
[4432.18 --> 4433.18]  Great is thy
[4433.18 --> 4433.62]  Faithfulness
[4433.62 --> 4435.94]  As we sing
[4435.94 --> 4436.96]  This song
[4436.96 --> 4438.98]  Let the spirit
[4438.98 --> 4440.20]  Speak to your heart
[4440.20 --> 4441.78]  And lead you
[4441.78 --> 4443.04]  Not only into
[4443.04 --> 4444.82]  Genuine worship
[4444.82 --> 4445.62]  But also
[4445.62 --> 4446.72]  To place
[4446.72 --> 4448.20]  On your mind
[4448.20 --> 4449.98]  And in your heart
[4449.98 --> 4450.98]  Someone
[4450.98 --> 4452.42]  Whom you
[4452.42 --> 4453.70]  Need to talk to
[4453.70 --> 4454.38]  This week
[4454.38 --> 4455.64]  And share
[4455.64 --> 4457.34]  This story
[4457.34 --> 4458.30]  With
[4458.30 --> 4459.40]  Amen
[4459.40 --> 4461.84]  Let's stand together
[4461.84 --> 4462.92]  We're going to sing
[4462.92 --> 4463.80]  As our
[4463.80 --> 4464.74]  Closing prayer
[4464.74 --> 4466.26] vell
[4494.74 --> 4510.60]  Great is thy faithfulness, O God my Father.
[4510.60 --> 4519.92]  There is no shadow of turning with me.
[4519.92 --> 4527.92]  Thou changest from your compassion, faith in me.
[4529.04 --> 4535.92]  As thou hast been, thou forever wilt be.
[4537.78 --> 4544.92]  Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[4544.92 --> 4552.92]  Morning by morning, through mercies I see.
[4554.62 --> 4561.92]  All I have here, thy hand hath provided.
[4563.12 --> 4570.54]  Great is thy faithfulness, Lord unto me.
[4570.54 --> 4581.54]  Summer and winter and springtime and harvest.
[4582.54 --> 4589.54]  Sun, moon, and stars in their courses above.
[4589.54 --> 4599.58]  Join with all the nature in man and fall in blues.
[4599.58 --> 4607.54]  To thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.
[4607.54 --> 4615.54]  Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[4615.54 --> 4624.54]  Morning by morning, through mercies I see.
[4624.54 --> 4633.54]  All I have needed, thy hand hath provided.
[4633.54 --> 4642.54]  Great is thy faithfulness, Lord unto me.
[4642.54 --> 4644.54]  God bless you.
[4644.54 --> 4654.54]  Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth.
[4654.54 --> 4663.54]  Thy own dear presence to cheer and to guide.
[4663.54 --> 4664.54]  Open for light, through mercies I see.
[4664.54 --> 4665.54]  Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow.
[4665.54 --> 4670.54]  Bright hope for tomorrow.
[4670.54 --> 4679.54]  Blessings all mine with ten thousand beside.
[4679.54 --> 4688.54]  Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[4688.54 --> 4691.36]  Thy faithfulness
[4691.36 --> 4695.04]  Morning by morning
[4695.04 --> 4699.14]  Through mercies I see
[4699.14 --> 4704.04]  All I am needed
[4704.04 --> 4708.14]  Thy hand hath provided
[4708.14 --> 4714.04]  Great is Thy faithfulness
[4714.04 --> 4719.04]  Glory unto me
[4719.04 --> 4726.46]  Amen. You may have a seat together.
[4729.04 --> 4733.90]  We're going to take this time and come to the Lord's table together.
[4734.32 --> 4740.94]  As we do, there's a bit of a liturgy spoken and received that we participate in.
[4741.02 --> 4743.46]  You'll see that on the screen behind me.
[4743.46 --> 4745.60]  I encourage you to speak your part.
[4745.68 --> 4747.88]  The words there that are in yellow.
[4748.72 --> 4749.94]  We come then to the table.
[4750.08 --> 4751.96]  And so lift up your hearts.
[4754.54 --> 4757.14]  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
[4760.24 --> 4761.34]  Let's pray together.
[4761.34 --> 4766.72]  With joy we praise you, gracious God.
[4767.22 --> 4769.36]  For you have created heaven and earth.
[4769.46 --> 4775.14]  You have made us in your image and kept covenant with us even when we fell into sin.
[4775.98 --> 4784.78]  We give you thanks for Jesus Christ, who by his life, death, and resurrection opened to us the way of life everlasting.
[4784.78 --> 4785.78]  Amen.
[4785.78 --> 4786.00]  Amen.
[4789.00 --> 4798.08]  Our Lord Jesus, before he suffered, gave us this memorial of his sacrifice until he comes again.
[4798.08 --> 4803.70]  The Lord Jesus, on the night that he was betrayed, took bread.
[4805.34 --> 4808.12]  And when he had given thanks, he broke it and he said,
[4808.44 --> 4811.18]  This is my body, which is for you.
[4812.30 --> 4815.54]  Do this in remembrance of me.
[4815.54 --> 4822.30]  In the same way, he took the cup after supper, saying,
[4823.04 --> 4826.18]  This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[4827.18 --> 4831.22]  Do this whenever you drink it in remembrance of me.
[4832.06 --> 4835.74]  For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup,
[4835.88 --> 4840.64]  you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes again.
[4840.64 --> 4846.88]  This is the mystery of our faith.
[4848.38 --> 4851.08]  Your death, O Christ, we proclaim.
[4851.84 --> 4854.46]  Your resurrection, we affirm with joy.
[4855.34 --> 4857.46]  Your coming, we await with hope.
[4858.38 --> 4860.52]  Glory be to you, Lord Jesus.
[4862.58 --> 4867.66]  Church family, the Lord has prepared his table for all who love him
[4867.66 --> 4871.12]  and all who trust in him alone for their salvation.
[4871.90 --> 4877.92]  And so, come to this table, you who have much faith and you who would like to have more.
[4878.78 --> 4882.82]  Come to this table, you who have been to the sacrament often
[4882.82 --> 4885.42]  and you who have not been for a long time.
[4885.52 --> 4890.66]  Come to this table, you who have tried to follow Jesus and you who have failed.
[4891.40 --> 4897.24]  Come to this table because Jesus Christ is raised and he welcomes you here.
[4897.66 --> 4902.82]  Come to this table if you are present with us or if you are joining us online.
[4904.54 --> 4905.80]  Come to this table.
[4906.56 --> 4910.18]  The gifts of God for the people of God.
[4911.44 --> 4917.18]  As we come to this table, we will approach the front and gather in a circle around
[4917.18 --> 4920.00]  and then we will pass the elements around.
[4920.20 --> 4924.46]  As you pass the bread, I encourage you to say the body of Christ given for you.
[4924.46 --> 4930.24]  As you pass the juice, I encourage you as well to say the blood of Christ shed for you.
[4931.48 --> 4936.96]  If you are interested in the center of each tray is gluten-free bread.
[4938.14 --> 4943.92]  If you would like or are unable to take the risk of that gluten-free bread having touched
[4943.92 --> 4947.26]  the white bread in there because of celiac or some other thing, please indicate that
[4947.26 --> 4949.76]  and we have one here that has been completely set to the side
[4949.76 --> 4951.48]  and we will serve you from there as well.
[4951.48 --> 4956.10]  We are going to begin with those who are helping us worship.
[4956.68 --> 4961.40]  The worship team, the elders who will come up to the front and the ushers who will indicate
[4961.40 --> 4962.68]  when it is time for you to go.
[4963.04 --> 4967.32]  People of the back of house, I invite you all to come to the front here to be served
[4967.32 --> 4969.56]  and then we will move through as indicated.
[4969.56 --> 4981.84]  As this group is making their way up to the front, if you are interested in praying with someone,
[4982.06 --> 4985.92]  receiving prayer, or praying through an issue or circumstance,
[4986.22 --> 4991.14]  there are people available in the foyer who have name tags with yellow squares on them.
[4991.14 --> 4997.10]  They would love to meet with you for prayer as well.
[5002.56 --> 5004.06]  Body of Christ given for you.
[5006.46 --> 5007.76]  Body of Christ given for you.
[5015.48 --> 5016.68]  Body of Christ given for you.
[5017.48 --> 5018.66]  Body of Christ given for you.
[5018.66 --> 5018.78]  Body of Christ given for you.
[5019.04 --> 5020.76]  Body of Christ given for you.
[5020.76 --> 5022.58]  Oh, that was quick.
[5041.36 --> 5043.36]  Eat and remember.
[5050.76 --> 5066.18]  The blood of Christ shed for you.
[5070.48 --> 5071.76]  The blood of Christ shed for you.
[5075.22 --> 5076.56]  The blood of Christ shed for you.
[5080.76 --> 5110.74]  Thank you.
[5110.76 --> 5112.92]  Drink and believe.
[5128.10 --> 5132.88]  As well, if you are unable to come up to the front but would like to receive the Lord's Supper,
[5133.00 --> 5137.26]  please indicate that to the elder ushers and they will serve you in your seats.
[5140.76 --> 5170.74]  Thank you.
[5170.76 --> 5172.76]  Thank you.
[5172.76 --> 5174.76]  Thank you.

[5950.52 --> 5957.52]  He is Lord, Lord of all
[5957.52 --> 5968.52]  And He shall come with trumpet sound
[5968.52 --> 5974.52]  Oh, may I then in Him be found
[5974.52 --> 5980.52]  Dressed in His righteousness alone
[5980.52 --> 5987.52]  All may stand before the throne

[6064.52 --> 6067.52]  And set a holy table among us
[6068.52 --> 6070.52]  Filling our plates with the bread of life
[6070.52 --> 6073.52]  And our cups with salvation
[6074.52 --> 6077.52]  Send us out, O God, with tender-heartedness

[6080.52 --> 6084.52]  With the promise of your extraordinary presence
