[1949.78 → 1979.76] There is joy.
[1979.78 → 2009.76] There is love, there is
[2009.78 → 2039.76] Please be, you.
[2039.76 → 2069.74] Thank you.
[2069.74 → 2099.72] Do not forget to do good, do not forget, do not forget, do not forget, do not forget,
[2099.72 → 2129.70] I love you.
[2129.72 → 2159.70] Thank you.
[2159.72 → 2189.70] Thank you.
[2189.72 → 2219.70] Thank you.
[2219.70 → 2249.68] Thank you.
[2249.70 → 2279.68] Thank you.
[2279.70 → 2309.68] Thank you.
[2309.70 → 2339.68] Thank you.
[2339.70 → 2369.68] All right.
[2369.68 → 2399.66] Thank you.
[2399.68 → 2429.66] Thank you.
[2429.66 → 2459.64] Thank you.
[2459.66 → 2489.66] All right.
[2489.66 → 2519.64] You're welcome.
[2519.64 → 2549.62] A couple of you.
[2549.62 → 2579.62] Thank you.
[2579.62 → 2609.60] Thank you.
[2609.60 → 2639.58] Thank you.
[2639.58 → 2669.56] Thank you.
[2669.58 → 2699.56] Father in heaven.
[2699.56 → 2729.54] And yet, you're with us.
[2729.54 → 2759.52] Thank you.
[2759.52 → 2789.50] And this, I'll, we'll make you, we'll bring us, you will, and you're with us, and in the
[2789.50 → 2798.00] We ask that you will continue to be with and give strength and comfort to Brenda, Linda, and Jody and their families as they remember their mom, Mini.
[2801.72 → 2806.68] We pray for Tanya and Samara and their family as they remember their grandma.
[2809.38 → 2815.60] We especially remember all those who have lost loved ones recently, and even if it hasn't been recently,
[2815.60 → 2822.42] Christmas can be a difficult time when we think of those who have gone before us.
[2825.38 → 2830.52] We thank you for the new baby in the lives of David and Sheila and their families,
[2831.04 → 2839.04] and we pray that you will help them raise her up to be what you want her to be.
[2839.54 → 2844.02] Help Abba to grow strong in the knowledge that you are her Saviour.
[2846.50 → 2851.62] We thank you that Jerry Jansen's daughter and her granddaughter were both able to receive healing.
[2853.14 → 2857.32] We pray that you will continue to be with them so that they can get stronger.
[2857.32 → 2866.90] We thank you for healing in the life of Dennis, and we pray that you will help him deal with his new reality.
[2869.36 → 2875.78] We pray that you will be with students and teachers in this last week leading up to the end of the school year.
[2875.78 → 2883.92] Lord, we ask that you will be with those who are underemployed or looking for work,
[2884.28 → 2889.02] and we pray for comfort and patience in the realities of this economy.
[2889.02 → 2896.66] Lord, we ask that you will continue to help this church to gather in your name,
[2897.32 → 2902.44] to grow in the knowledge that you are with us and saved us from our sins.
[2903.30 → 2908.48] Help us to go out into the community around us and share your love.
[2908.48 → 2913.84] Father, we pray, hear us.
[2915.10 → 2917.12] Look upon the list of our concerns.
[2918.18 → 2920.90] We know that you knew it before we wrote it down,
[2921.06 → 2926.00] and we know that you know us better than us
[2926.00 → 2932.20] and must be prayed in each of these circumstances.
[2934.92 → 2939.36] We ask that your Holy Spirit completes all these things for us.
[2941.62 → 2944.94] As we hear your word for us this morning, preached by Josh,
[2945.56 → 2950.42] fulfill your will and purposes among us by your Holy Spirit
[2950.42 → 2956.38] so that your kingdom will advance through us and your Holy Name is glorified.
[2957.38 → 2963.28] The story of amazing love, the light of the world given for us.
[2964.88 → 2967.86] Father, we pray that our eyes would be fixed on Jesus.
[2968.50 → 2970.06] We pray that by your Spirit,
[2970.96 → 2975.86] you might bring into our hearts to believe and to trust in you.
[2975.86 → 2980.70] We pray for all these things because of your Holy Name.
[2981.46 → 2981.82] Amen.
[2981.82 → 2981.94] Amen.
[2999.82 → 3000.72] I think I figured out.
[3001.42 → 3001.82] Mike.
[3003.24 → 3004.70] I don't think I've used this one before.
[3004.70 → 3006.16] Oh, there we go.
[3006.66 → 3006.90] Haha.
[3007.24 → 3008.44] Tech specialist.
[3009.50 → 3010.06] Got it.
[3011.68 → 3012.26] Let's pray.
[3014.40 → 3016.70] Dear Lord, thank you for this wonderful day
[3016.70 → 3018.42] in which we get to hear your word.
[3019.00 → 3022.70] I pray, Lord, that my words would not be my own, but yours,
[3023.48 → 3025.74] and that we would all experience the joy of the Lord
[3025.74 → 3029.12] as a result of your word, your gospel.
[3029.92 → 3030.12] Amen.
[3030.12 → 3030.20] Amen.
[3034.70 → 3036.84] Joy to the world.
[3037.16 → 3038.68] The joy of Christmas.
[3039.22 → 3041.08] Joyful, joyful, we adore you.
[3041.58 → 3043.16] I've got the Christmas joy,
[3044.16 → 3046.10] says the one wearing all black.
[3048.16 → 3050.42] Joy is one of those feelings and words
[3050.42 → 3052.74] that goes part and parcel with Christmas.
[3052.74 → 3055.80] People feel joy in other times of the year,
[3055.80 → 3059.20] but Christmas has a specific hold on that word.
[3059.70 → 3063.80] It's so easy for joy to be portrayed as the feeling we get
[3063.80 → 3067.76] when we see pretty lights or when we see family at Christmas parties
[3067.76 → 3070.84] or when you're driving back home from the Christmas service
[3070.84 → 3072.52] and the snow is gently drifting down.
[3072.52 → 3076.52] Or, of course, that feeling when you wake up in the morning as a kid
[3076.52 → 3078.62] and you see your presents by the tree.
[3080.06 → 3083.46] The joy we focus on at Christmas, as I mentioned,
[3083.60 → 3085.16] comes and goes with the weather
[3085.16 → 3087.26] or it comes and goes with a set of cookies.
[3088.08 → 3090.08] This version of joy is a good thing.
[3093.04 → 3094.66] But the joy of Advent,
[3095.14 → 3097.12] the joy of the Bible is so much deeper
[3097.12 → 3099.22] and it's rooted in something
[3099.22 → 3100.96] that does not come and go.
[3101.44 → 3102.78] It's rooted in something timeless
[3102.78 → 3103.98] and ever-present.
[3104.44 → 3106.08] It is rooted in something powerful
[3106.08 → 3107.62] and grand beyond measure.
[3108.06 → 3109.18] It is rooted in God,
[3109.78 → 3110.54] in Christ Jesus.
[3111.46 → 3113.98] This joy rooted in Jesus
[3113.98 → 3116.28] and grounded in our future hope
[3116.28 → 3118.16] is what our passage is about today.
[3118.66 → 3120.04] So please, open up your Bibles
[3120.04 → 3123.58] or your phones to Isaiah 55, 6-13.
[3124.08 → 3125.92] The passage will also be on the screen above.
[3125.92 → 3128.00] So please follow along.
[3132.64 → 3134.70] Seek the Lord while He may be found.
[3135.36 → 3136.84] Call on Him while He is near.
[3137.58 → 3139.16] Let the wicked forsake their ways
[3139.16 → 3140.84] and the unrighteous their thoughts.
[3141.54 → 3142.82] Let them turn to the Lord
[3142.82 → 3144.38] and He will have mercy on them.
[3144.88 → 3145.76] And to our God,
[3146.04 → 3147.20] for He will freely pardon.
[3148.34 → 3149.96] For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
[3150.26 → 3152.00] neither are your ways my ways,
[3152.66 → 3153.42] declares the Lord.
[3153.94 → 3155.64] As the heavens are higher than the earth,
[3156.16 → 3157.84] so are my ways higher than your ways
[3157.84 → 3159.66] and my thoughts than your thoughts.
[3160.20 → 3162.76] As the rain and the snow come down from heaven
[3162.76 → 3165.42] and do not return to it without watering the earth
[3165.42 → 3166.56] and making it blood,
[3167.18 → 3168.32] bud and flourish,
[3168.64 → 3170.46] so that it yields seed for the sower
[3170.46 → 3171.46] and bread for the eater,
[3172.22 → 3174.24] so is my word that goes out from my mouth.
[3174.58 → 3176.12] It will not return to me empty,
[3176.12 → 3178.34] but will accomplish what I desire
[3178.34 → 3180.40] and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.
[3181.04 → 3182.22] You will go out in joy
[3182.22 → 3183.76] and be led forth in peace.
[3184.28 → 3185.78] The mountains and the hills
[3185.78 → 3187.76] will burst into song before you
[3187.76 → 3189.50] and all the trees of the field
[3189.50 → 3190.54] will clap their hands.
[3191.62 → 3192.72] Instead of the thorn bush,
[3192.80 → 3193.68] I will grow the juniper.
[3194.28 → 3195.20] Instead of the briars,
[3195.32 → 3196.12] the myrtle will grow.
[3196.12 → 3198.58] This will be for the Lord's renown
[3198.58 → 3200.16] for an everlasting sign
[3200.16 → 3201.70] that will endure forever.
[3206.44 → 3207.90] Our passage today
[3207.90 → 3209.36] is about the future hope
[3209.36 → 3210.92] of a world made right,
[3211.40 → 3212.80] about a garden returned
[3212.80 → 3214.00] to its proper state
[3214.00 → 3216.00] and the Lord being with His people
[3216.00 → 3217.48] on earth once again.
[3218.32 → 3220.10] This passage is about the joy
[3220.10 → 3222.86] of finally having everything right,
[3222.86 → 3226.94] of not having the things brought in by sin
[3226.94 → 3227.72] get in the way.
[3228.38 → 3229.70] Or as Pastor Chris put it
[3229.70 → 3230.84] in the first Sunday of Advent,
[3231.30 → 3233.30] when there is peace, shalom.
[3234.80 → 3236.14] But we're not there yet.
[3236.44 → 3237.78] And the Bible has a lot to say
[3237.78 → 3238.66] about the kind of joy
[3238.66 → 3240.20] that we can have here and now.
[3241.04 → 3242.94] That as that future joy
[3242.94 → 3244.32] works backwards through history
[3244.32 → 3245.48] to this present moment.
[3247.16 → 3248.54] Our big idea today
[3248.54 → 3249.78] is that biblical joy
[3249.78 → 3251.44] is not the result
[3251.44 → 3252.50] of something good happening.
[3252.86 → 3254.94] but an attitude God's people
[3254.94 → 3255.80] can adopt
[3255.80 → 3258.20] despite whatever happens.
[3260.72 → 3262.00] Now that being said,
[3262.36 → 3263.32] when something good happens,
[3263.40 → 3265.64] it is good to feel joy.
[3266.24 → 3267.70] And the Bible is filled with times
[3267.70 → 3268.58] in which people are.
[3269.28 → 3270.96] Psalm 65, 11 to 12.
[3271.38 → 3272.96] You crown the year with your bounty
[3272.96 → 3275.10] and your carts overflow with abundance.
[3275.50 → 3277.60] The grasslands of the wilderness overflow.
[3278.26 → 3280.36] The hills are clothed with gladness.
[3280.64 → 3282.04] The meadows are covered with flocks
[3282.04 → 3283.60] and the valleys are mantled with grain.
[3283.92 → 3285.70] They shout for joy and sing.
[3286.94 → 3289.42] Nature itself sings and shouts in joy
[3289.42 → 3290.68] to the God that made it.
[3291.04 → 3292.44] The animals and plants
[3292.44 → 3294.76] and the very earth are glad
[3294.76 → 3296.78] because of the richness of creation.
[3296.78 → 3301.86] And Psalm 104, 14 to 15 says,
[3301.86 → 3303.56] He makes grass grow for the cattle
[3303.56 → 3305.22] and plants for the people to cultivate,
[3305.88 → 3307.46] bringing forth food from the earth
[3307.46 → 3310.24] and wine that gladdens the human heart,
[3310.78 → 3312.28] oil to make their faces shine
[3312.28 → 3314.52] and bread that sustains their hearts.
[3315.32 → 3316.48] Not only nature,
[3316.56 → 3318.60] but also humanity is filled with joy
[3318.60 → 3320.52] because of the world in which God has made.
[3321.04 → 3322.80] He has provided everything we need
[3322.80 → 3323.42] and more.
[3324.70 → 3327.20] And third, Proverbs 23, 24 to 25.
[3327.68 → 3329.82] The father of a righteous child has great joy.
[3330.34 → 3332.78] A man who fathers a wise son rejoices in him.
[3334.02 → 3335.56] May your father and mother rejoice.
[3335.94 → 3337.60] May she who gave you birth be joyful.
[3338.56 → 3340.56] When we see the miracle of new life,
[3340.62 → 3342.18] it's not just the parents who are joyful,
[3342.40 → 3344.88] but also the people who see how joyful they are.
[3345.42 → 3346.60] When a new baby is born,
[3346.76 → 3347.98] everyone here goes crazy
[3347.98 → 3350.24] and flocks around it and starts smiling.
[3350.42 → 3351.10] It's wonderful.
[3353.58 → 3355.08] When God blesses us
[3355.08 → 3358.04] and when we realize how greatly we are blessed
[3358.04 → 3358.72] in this world,
[3358.80 → 3360.06] we should feel joy.
[3361.34 → 3363.78] We should respond with glee and gratefulness.
[3364.02 → 3366.10] Even with sin marring creation
[3366.10 → 3367.34] and blurring our vision,
[3367.80 → 3370.56] we can still look at mountains and forests
[3370.56 → 3372.26] and the ocean and the night sky
[3372.26 → 3374.44] with wonder and joy.
[3374.44 → 3374.52] Joy.
[3378.72 → 3379.20] But,
[3379.92 → 3381.56] joy is not just a feeling.
[3382.26 → 3383.28] It's also an attitude.
[3384.42 → 3385.70] And joy can be our attitude
[3385.70 → 3387.76] when we experience what God has done
[3387.76 → 3389.42] for us and gives us.
[3390.80 → 3392.82] Now, feelings and attitudes are slightly different.
[3393.42 → 3394.58] A feeling is a reaction
[3394.58 → 3396.32] or a response to something that happens
[3396.32 → 3397.04] or doesn't happen.
[3398.30 → 3400.08] And an attitude is a state of mind
[3400.08 → 3401.32] that you can choose to take
[3401.32 → 3403.22] regardless of what you feel.
[3404.44 → 3405.50] Here are two examples.
[3406.20 → 3406.90] The first example
[3406.90 → 3408.54] is we don't always feel thankful.
[3409.60 → 3411.04] We might feel that there is nothing
[3411.04 → 3411.88] to be thankful for.
[3412.62 → 3414.46] But in moments where we don't feel thankful,
[3414.64 → 3416.00] we can still give thanks
[3416.00 → 3417.10] in all circumstances.
[3417.90 → 3419.40] 1 Thessalonians 5.18
[3419.40 → 3421.60] That passage doesn't command us
[3421.60 → 3422.48] to feel thankful,
[3423.34 → 3424.62] just to give thanks.
[3425.58 → 3426.16] And specifically,
[3426.34 → 3427.26] to give thanks to God
[3427.26 → 3428.40] for what He has done.
[3429.80 → 3431.78] The second example is this.
[3431.78 → 3433.10] When Joshua was given
[3433.10 → 3434.12] the mantle of leadership
[3434.12 → 3436.02] over Israel going into Canaan,
[3436.78 → 3438.04] God gave him a pep talk.
[3438.96 → 3439.78] God tells Joshua
[3439.78 → 3441.16] to be strong and courageous,
[3441.62 → 3442.86] do not be afraid,
[3443.38 → 3444.44] and to be courageous.
[3445.70 → 3447.42] Now, if Joshua wasn't afraid
[3447.42 → 3448.18] at the prospect
[3448.18 → 3449.30] of leading the Israelites,
[3449.62 → 3451.08] who he knows are fickle
[3451.08 → 3452.00] and disobedient,
[3452.96 → 3454.30] and even to lead them
[3454.30 → 3456.04] into battle against trained armies,
[3456.62 → 3457.76] then he wouldn't need
[3457.76 → 3458.42] to be courageous
[3458.42 → 3460.10] because he would be confident.
[3460.74 → 3461.36] He might even have
[3461.36 → 3462.70] a complete sense of assurance.
[3463.96 → 3464.96] Courage is doing something
[3464.96 → 3465.64] you know you should
[3465.64 → 3466.92] even when you are afraid.
[3467.40 → 3468.34] And God commands him
[3468.34 → 3469.12] to be courageous,
[3469.74 → 3473.40] considering the fearful odds
[3473.40 → 3475.44] solely because God is with him,
[3475.86 → 3477.30] despite how he feels,
[3477.46 → 3478.56] because of what God will do
[3478.56 → 3479.42] and has done.
[3480.28 → 3481.26] Joshua could take on
[3481.26 → 3482.50] that attitude of courage.
[3484.74 → 3486.24] Just like how Thessalonians
[3486.24 → 3486.80] teaches us
[3486.80 → 3487.56] that we can give thanks
[3487.56 → 3488.54] when we don't feel thankful,
[3489.08 → 3490.36] and how Joshua teaches us
[3490.36 → 3491.42] that we can be courageous
[3491.42 → 3492.40] in the face of terror,
[3493.84 → 3497.00] we can do the same with joy.
[3497.70 → 3499.18] We can choose to be joyful
[3499.18 → 3500.56] when we don't feel like it.
[3501.50 → 3502.16] Not only that,
[3502.26 → 3503.48] joy can be our attitude
[3503.48 → 3505.44] when we lack everything
[3505.44 → 3506.58] and suffer.
[3507.28 → 3508.36] Even when we have
[3508.36 → 3509.96] every reason not to be joyful,
[3510.22 → 3511.48] we can still take on
[3511.48 → 3512.10] that attitude.
[3513.52 → 3515.54] Jeremiah 33, 10-11 says,
[3515.54 → 3517.32] This is what the Lord says.
[3518.06 → 3519.16] You say about this place,
[3519.28 → 3520.56] it is a desolate waste,
[3520.96 → 3522.46] without people or animals.
[3522.86 → 3524.04] Yet in the towns of Judah
[3524.04 → 3525.22] and the streets of Jerusalem
[3525.22 → 3525.96] that are deserted,
[3526.52 → 3527.54] inhabited by neither people
[3527.54 → 3528.18] nor animals,
[3528.34 → 3529.92] there will be heard once more
[3529.92 → 3531.56] the sounds of joy
[3531.56 → 3532.80] and gladness.
[3533.24 → 3534.34] The voices of bride
[3534.34 → 3535.04] and bridegroom,
[3535.14 → 3535.90] the voices of those
[3535.90 → 3537.08] who bring thank offerings
[3537.08 → 3538.40] to the house of the Lord,
[3538.78 → 3539.06] saying,
[3539.20 → 3540.60] Give thanks to the Lord Almighty,
[3541.10 → 3541.94] for the Lord is good.
[3542.04 → 3543.84] His love endures forever.
[3543.84 → 3545.58] For I will restore
[3545.58 → 3546.80] the fortunes of the land
[3546.80 → 3547.82] as they were before,
[3548.16 → 3548.74] says the Lord.
[3551.06 → 3552.56] Why are the Israelites rejoicing
[3552.56 → 3553.90] if the streets are desolate
[3553.90 → 3554.64] and waste,
[3555.16 → 3556.94] and they're poor beyond measure?
[3557.58 → 3559.52] Because the Lord is good,
[3559.94 → 3561.46] and His love endures forever,
[3562.40 → 3563.68] and that future promise.
[3564.80 → 3565.38] Tim Mickey,
[3565.70 → 3566.60] the guy who was speaking
[3566.60 → 3567.50] in the video before,
[3567.98 → 3568.22] said,
[3568.46 → 3569.50] The joy of God's people
[3569.50 → 3570.16] is not determined
[3570.16 → 3571.16] by their circumstances,
[3571.62 → 3573.30] but rather their future destiny.
[3574.54 → 3575.16] The Israelites,
[3575.40 → 3576.56] Jeremiah is writing about,
[3576.64 → 3577.94] are going to enter Israel
[3577.94 → 3579.00] and see the temple
[3579.00 → 3579.80] and Jerusalem
[3579.80 → 3582.12] in ruins and overgrown,
[3582.50 → 3584.18] and yet they will rejoice
[3584.18 → 3585.80] because God is good,
[3586.28 → 3586.96] and one day,
[3587.20 → 3588.32] by His faithful promise,
[3588.46 → 3589.48] Jerusalem and the temple
[3589.48 → 3590.40] will be rebuilt.
[3591.92 → 3592.34] Remember,
[3593.08 → 3594.24] biblical joy is not a result
[3594.24 → 3595.28] of something good happening,
[3595.66 → 3596.50] but an attitude
[3596.50 → 3597.66] God's people can adopt
[3597.66 → 3599.54] despite whatever happens.
[3599.54 → 3605.18] Now,
[3605.24 → 3606.04] before the Israelites
[3606.04 → 3607.08] of Jeremiah's time,
[3607.32 → 3607.96] there were the Israelites
[3607.96 → 3608.96] leaving Egypt.
[3609.86 → 3610.30] Psalm 105,
[3610.60 → 3611.38] 43 says,
[3611.74 → 3612.70] He brought out His people
[3612.70 → 3613.70] with rejoicing,
[3614.12 → 3615.02] His chosen ones
[3615.02 → 3616.10] with shouts of joy.
[3617.36 → 3618.52] They were in a desert
[3618.52 → 3619.44] with only the food
[3619.44 → 3621.08] in their bags,
[3621.28 → 3622.26] and with no army
[3622.26 → 3623.02] to protect them,
[3623.38 → 3624.44] and the east wind
[3624.44 → 3625.74] was beating on their heads.
[3626.06 → 3627.20] It was miserable,
[3627.20 → 3631.08] but God had been faithful
[3631.08 → 3632.42] to take them out of Egypt
[3632.42 → 3633.54] and would be faithful
[3633.54 → 3634.06] to bring them
[3634.06 → 3635.90] into that future promised land,
[3636.18 → 3637.70] and so they walked
[3637.70 → 3639.12] with shouts of joy.
[3640.04 → 3641.14] God would provide for them
[3641.14 → 3642.30] food in quail
[3642.30 → 3643.82] and water from a rock,
[3644.02 → 3645.92] and God would provide them
[3645.92 → 3648.28] victory as their army.
[3649.90 → 3651.42] In the face of terror
[3651.42 → 3652.14] and suffering,
[3652.30 → 3653.36] God's people can choose
[3653.36 → 3654.26] to be joyful,
[3654.78 → 3656.14] and when those future promises
[3656.14 → 3656.84] do come,
[3657.20 → 3658.66] they will not only adopt
[3658.66 → 3659.72] the attitude of joy,
[3659.94 → 3661.32] but they can feel it.
[3662.28 → 3663.40] Isaiah 51, 11,
[3663.88 → 3665.18] Those the Lord has rescued
[3665.18 → 3666.00] will return.
[3666.42 → 3667.60] They will enter Zion
[3667.60 → 3668.34] with singing.
[3668.84 → 3669.84] Everlasting joy
[3669.84 → 3671.08] will crown their heads.
[3671.60 → 3672.72] Gladness and joy
[3672.72 → 3673.70] will overtake them,
[3673.94 → 3675.50] and sorrow and sighing
[3675.50 → 3676.58] will flee away.
[3676.58 → 3686.02] Flip the page too quick.
[3690.02 → 3691.38] Now some might say,
[3692.04 → 3693.42] what about the sorrow
[3693.42 → 3694.40] and the suffering
[3694.40 → 3695.66] that I experience?
[3696.30 → 3697.28] I have good reason
[3697.28 → 3697.94] to be sad,
[3698.80 → 3700.36] or suffering
[3700.36 → 3700.90] is not something
[3700.90 → 3701.80] that I can just smile
[3701.80 → 3702.96] or wave my way through.
[3702.96 → 3706.24] This pain is unrelenting.
[3706.24 → 3707.74] I can't just ignore that.
[3708.54 → 3710.26] Is my pain not valid?
[3712.36 → 3713.52] And to that I say,
[3713.60 → 3714.70] absolutely it is.
[3715.36 → 3716.78] The sorrow and the suffering
[3716.78 → 3717.98] we experience now
[3717.98 → 3719.62] is not something
[3719.62 → 3720.80] that I would ever say
[3720.80 → 3722.86] is not real
[3722.86 → 3723.86] or big
[3723.86 → 3724.68] or overwhelming.
[3725.72 → 3726.18] Suffering
[3726.18 → 3726.92] and pain
[3726.92 → 3727.68] and grief
[3727.68 → 3728.44] and loss
[3728.44 → 3729.26] are real
[3729.26 → 3730.40] and deep.
[3730.40 → 3732.36] and in no way am I,
[3732.64 → 3733.68] nor is the Bible saying,
[3734.28 → 3735.56] just dismiss how you feel
[3735.56 → 3737.38] or turn that frown
[3737.38 → 3738.12] upside down
[3738.12 → 3739.10] as if it was something
[3739.10 → 3740.52] that you could just be decided.
[3741.66 → 3742.06] No.
[3742.74 → 3743.70] On the contrary,
[3743.86 → 3744.86] the Bible affirms
[3744.86 → 3745.94] our pain and suffering
[3745.94 → 3747.18] and even affirms
[3747.18 → 3748.88] this mysterious middle ground
[3748.88 → 3750.02] where we can be
[3750.02 → 3750.96] both sorrowful
[3750.96 → 3751.84] and joyful.
[3753.58 → 3754.26] Paul writes
[3754.26 → 3755.90] from prison
[3755.90 → 3757.00] saying these words,
[3757.38 → 3759.30] 2 Corinthians 6.10,
[3759.30 → 3760.78] sorrowful
[3760.78 → 3762.44] yet always rejoicing,
[3763.04 → 3763.44] poor
[3763.44 → 3765.06] yet making many rich,
[3765.50 → 3766.58] having nothing
[3766.58 → 3768.76] and yet possessing everything.
[3770.32 → 3771.26] Paul feels
[3771.26 → 3771.98] the sorrow
[3771.98 → 3772.84] and the pain
[3772.84 → 3774.46] of lived suffering,
[3775.02 → 3775.68] shipwrecked,
[3775.84 → 3776.86] attacked by animals,
[3777.10 → 3777.60] imprisoned
[3777.60 → 3779.30] and beaten by crowds
[3779.30 → 3781.34] and yet also rejoices
[3781.34 → 3782.14] in the truth
[3782.14 → 3783.02] of God's goodness
[3783.02 → 3784.46] and faithfulness.
[3785.02 → 3785.72] And even Jesus
[3785.72 → 3786.54] who is referred to
[3786.54 → 3786.96] in Isaiah
[3786.96 → 3788.24] as the man of sorrow
[3788.24 → 3789.82] in Luke 2.10
[3789.82 → 3791.40] can be full of joy
[3791.40 → 3792.28] in the Holy Spirit
[3792.28 → 3793.16] for what his father
[3793.16 → 3793.78] has done
[3793.78 → 3795.46] even with his own
[3795.46 → 3796.44] persecution and death
[3796.44 → 3796.88] on the way.
[3799.82 → 3801.02] In the early church,
[3801.46 → 3802.14] a period of about
[3802.14 → 3803.38] 350 years
[3803.38 → 3804.72] after Jesus' death,
[3805.26 → 3805.94] the church faced
[3805.94 → 3806.52] persecution
[3806.52 → 3807.18] and hardship
[3807.18 → 3808.48] and some moments
[3808.48 → 3809.12] within this period
[3809.12 → 3809.64] the persecution
[3809.64 → 3811.68] was much more vicious
[3811.68 → 3812.52] and thorough.
[3813.52 → 3814.84] In 64 A.D.
[3814.84 → 3815.72] the persecution
[3815.72 → 3816.50] got so bad
[3816.50 → 3817.00] under Nero
[3817.00 → 3817.80] that he blamed
[3817.80 → 3818.26] the Christians
[3818.26 → 3819.28] for the fire of Rome.
[3820.08 → 3821.00] His solution
[3821.00 → 3821.80] was to use
[3821.80 → 3823.30] the Christians
[3823.30 → 3824.04] that he blamed
[3824.04 → 3825.00] as gladiators
[3825.00 → 3825.78] and for sport
[3825.78 → 3826.96] and worst of all
[3826.96 → 3828.00] many were crucified
[3828.00 → 3829.64] and set on fire
[3829.64 → 3830.84] to light the city streets
[3830.84 → 3831.26] at night.
[3835.04 → 3836.88] Amidst all of this suffering
[3836.88 → 3838.82] the countless records
[3838.82 → 3839.60] of Christians
[3839.60 → 3841.02] and Romans alike
[3841.02 → 3842.26] show that Christians
[3842.26 → 3843.52] would walk into this
[3843.52 → 3845.16] and other horrifying moments
[3845.16 → 3847.22] with songs of joy
[3847.22 → 3849.70] because they knew
[3849.70 → 3850.84] that the future glory
[3850.84 → 3852.54] that future with Jesus
[3852.54 → 3855.46] was so indescribably greater
[3855.46 → 3856.20] than what they were
[3856.20 → 3857.02] about to endure.
[3858.16 → 3859.26] As Tim Mickey
[3859.26 → 3860.68] again says so well
[3860.68 → 3861.78] when you believe
[3861.78 → 3862.94] that Jesus' love
[3862.94 → 3865.02] has overcome death itself
[3865.02 → 3866.96] joy becomes reasonable
[3866.96 → 3868.66] in the darkest circumstance.
[3869.30 → 3870.50] Even though it can be
[3870.50 → 3872.06] so dark and horrible
[3872.06 → 3874.56] as to the point of death
[3874.56 → 3876.20] you can remember
[3876.20 → 3877.36] that death itself
[3877.36 → 3878.94] was defeated by Christ
[3878.94 → 3879.72] on the cross
[3879.72 → 3880.66] and in the grave.
[3881.34 → 3882.30] And this is because
[3882.30 → 3883.96] joy can only be our attitude
[3883.96 → 3885.06] because of Christ.
[3885.42 → 3886.92] In him we have everything
[3886.92 → 3889.16] and he has done everything.
[3889.94 → 3890.66] This acknowledgement
[3890.66 → 3891.54] of Christ being
[3891.54 → 3892.44] the root of our joy
[3892.44 → 3893.74] is why the birth of Jesus
[3893.74 → 3895.08] in Luke 2.10 says
[3895.08 → 3896.80] but the angel said to them
[3896.80 → 3897.94] do not be afraid.
[3898.76 → 3899.72] I bring you good news
[3899.72 → 3900.86] that will cause great joy
[3900.86 → 3902.10] for all the people.
[3904.00 → 3905.44] The incarnation of Jesus
[3905.44 → 3906.26] was the beginning
[3906.26 → 3907.30] of that faithfulness
[3907.30 → 3908.34] God is so famous
[3908.34 → 3909.72] for coming to fruition.
[3910.56 → 3911.50] He was the thing
[3911.50 → 3912.28] that ancient Israel
[3912.28 → 3913.42] had their joy rooted in.
[3913.92 → 3914.82] The future destiny
[3914.82 → 3916.12] had finally arrived.
[3916.60 → 3917.40] The future city
[3917.40 → 3918.14] that is currently
[3918.14 → 3918.98] under construction
[3918.98 → 3920.50] was starting to be unveiled.
[3921.14 → 3922.92] That bread that brings life
[3922.92 → 3924.34] and the wine that makes glad
[3924.34 → 3925.22] the hearts of men
[3925.22 → 3926.82] was finally here.
[3927.56 → 3928.74] This baby was the reason
[3928.74 → 3930.20] Israel shouted for joy
[3930.20 → 3931.20] in the desert waste
[3931.20 → 3932.00] leaving Egypt.
[3932.90 → 3934.16] Deliverance had arrived.
[3934.62 → 3935.78] Peace has come.
[3936.34 → 3937.72] The hope was now real
[3937.72 → 3938.58] because the God
[3938.58 → 3939.32] who is love
[3939.32 → 3940.46] became a man.
[3941.92 → 3943.42] The gospel which means
[3943.42 → 3944.16] good news
[3944.16 → 3945.56] is the good news
[3945.56 → 3946.74] mentioned in Luke 2.10.
[3947.44 → 3948.30] That good news
[3948.30 → 3949.48] is that the Son of God
[3949.48 → 3950.84] who was born as a baby
[3950.84 → 3952.14] would live the life
[3952.14 → 3953.36] that we should have lived
[3953.36 → 3954.40] and would die the death
[3954.40 → 3955.32] that we should have died.
[3957.04 → 3958.22] And on the third day
[3958.22 → 3959.56] He would raise from the dead.
[3960.20 → 3961.06] And all of that
[3961.06 → 3962.52] was to free us from sin
[3962.52 → 3963.96] so that we could be with Him
[3963.96 → 3965.20] in resurrected bodies
[3965.20 → 3966.52] rejoicing with Him
[3966.52 → 3967.72] for eternity
[3967.72 → 3968.86] without suffering
[3968.86 → 3970.08] without pain
[3970.08 → 3971.38] and without tears.
[3975.84 → 3976.28] Remember
[3976.28 → 3977.52] biblical joy
[3977.52 → 3978.06] is not the result
[3978.06 → 3978.98] of something good happening.
[3979.82 → 3980.72] But an attitude
[3980.72 → 3981.78] God's people can adopt
[3981.78 → 3983.26] despite whatever happens.
[3985.16 → 3986.04] Our passage
[3986.04 → 3987.00] Isaiah 55
[3987.00 → 3988.02] 6-13
[3988.02 → 3990.06] is telling us
[3990.06 → 3990.78] that we need to
[3990.78 → 3991.80] seek the Lord.
[3992.54 → 3993.16] Turn to Him
[3993.16 → 3994.28] for it is only in Him
[3994.28 → 3995.06] that we find mercy
[3995.06 → 3995.68] and salvation
[3995.68 → 3996.72] and joy.
[3997.54 → 3998.48] It reminds us
[3998.48 → 3999.32] that God is greater
[3999.32 → 4000.32] than we can imagine.
[4000.78 → 4001.54] That our ways
[4001.54 → 4002.60] are not His ways
[4002.60 → 4003.98] as the heavens
[4003.98 → 4005.02] is greater than the earth.
[4006.26 → 4006.90] On earth
[4006.90 → 4008.10] there is suffering
[4008.10 → 4008.98] and pain
[4008.98 → 4009.80] and tears
[4009.80 → 4010.58] and death.
[4011.32 → 4012.16] But in heaven
[4012.16 → 4012.96] there is God
[4012.96 → 4013.90] and there is joy
[4013.90 → 4015.30] and there is eternal life.
[4016.06 → 4017.56] And we as God's people
[4017.56 → 4018.72] though on earth
[4018.72 → 4019.28] we suffer
[4019.28 → 4020.04] and die
[4020.04 → 4021.72] also rejoice
[4021.72 → 4023.14] in the everlasting life
[4023.14 → 4027.54] that our faithful
[4027.54 → 4028.40] and good God
[4028.40 → 4029.18] has provided us
[4029.18 → 4030.12] through Christ.
[4030.12 → 4031.96] for just as God
[4031.96 → 4032.60] said that when He
[4032.60 → 4033.54] sends out His word
[4033.54 → 4034.98] it does not come back
[4034.98 → 4035.80] until it has accomplished
[4035.80 → 4036.34] its purpose
[4036.34 → 4037.22] for which it was sent.
[4037.96 → 4039.28] The same can be said
[4039.28 → 4039.92] for Christ.
[4040.50 → 4040.86] Christ
[4040.86 → 4042.04] the word of God
[4042.04 → 4042.96] was sent
[4042.96 → 4044.14] for the purpose
[4044.14 → 4045.04] of uniting God
[4045.04 → 4045.78] with His people
[4045.78 → 4047.56] and He has accomplished
[4047.56 → 4048.66] that task.
[4049.24 → 4050.46] And now with this assurance
[4050.46 → 4051.62] in His faithfulness
[4051.62 → 4052.90] we can rejoice
[4052.90 → 4053.70] this Christmas
[4053.70 → 4054.72] in the knowledge
[4054.72 → 4055.98] of our future destiny
[4055.98 → 4058.10] despite our lived suffering.
[4058.10 → 4060.46] this Christmas
[4060.46 → 4061.36] many of us
[4061.36 → 4062.10] will not have
[4062.10 → 4063.62] the picturesque circumstances
[4063.62 → 4064.84] that are present
[4064.84 → 4065.50] in movies
[4065.50 → 4066.38] and in songs.
[4067.10 → 4068.34] We might be missing people
[4068.34 → 4069.08] and other things
[4069.08 → 4069.60] that would make
[4069.60 → 4070.96] those moments joyful.
[4072.62 → 4074.08] But even in this
[4074.08 → 4075.20] less than good time
[4075.20 → 4078.58] in these less than good times
[4078.58 → 4080.52] we can still take on joy
[4080.52 → 4083.04] because in Christ
[4083.04 → 4083.92] we have it all.
[4083.92 → 4086.10] We can be joyful
[4086.10 → 4087.28] despite the darkness
[4087.28 → 4088.22] we face
[4088.22 → 4089.26] because our joy
[4089.26 → 4089.88] is not dependent
[4089.88 → 4090.72] on decorations
[4090.72 → 4092.10] or on cookies
[4092.10 → 4093.80] or whether it snows or not.
[4094.96 → 4095.28] No.
[4095.92 → 4096.80] Our joy
[4096.80 → 4097.68] is in
[4097.68 → 4098.88] Christ.
[4102.16 → 4103.06] Let's pray.
[4106.14 → 4107.20] Dear Lord
[4107.20 → 4109.42] fill our hearts
[4109.42 → 4110.08] with joy
[4110.08 → 4111.86] and when we do not
[4111.86 → 4112.52] feel it
[4112.52 → 4113.94] I pray that we would
[4113.94 → 4114.98] still rejoice
[4114.98 → 4117.56] even in our weeping
[4117.56 → 4118.54] and in our sorrow
[4118.54 → 4120.46] and in our tears
[4120.46 → 4120.76] Lord
[4120.76 → 4121.62] I pray that we could
[4121.62 → 4122.96] still raise up voices
[4122.96 → 4124.40] and shouts of joy
[4124.40 → 4125.12] to You
[4125.12 → 4126.90] for everything
[4126.90 → 4127.60] You will do
[4127.60 → 4128.44] and have done
[4128.44 → 4130.12] for who You are
[4130.12 → 4132.94] and that You are with us.
[4134.04 → 4134.32] Amen.
[4134.32 → 4134.42] Amen.
[4142.52 → 4152.34] Please stand.
[4152.34 → 4152.36] Please stand.
[4152.36 → 4152.38] Please stand.
[4152.38 → 4156.38] Please stand.
[4156.38 → 4168.82] God of glory
[4168.82 → 4170.96] Lord of love
[4170.96 → 4186.42] hearts unfold
[4186.42 → 4188.38] like flowers
[4188.38 → 4189.64] before You
[4189.64 → 4190.42] opening
[4190.42 → 4192.06] to the
[4192.06 → 4194.28] Son of God
[4194.28 → 4203.60] and
[4203.60 → 4204.14] to do
[4204.14 → 4204.60] pagan
[4204.60 → 4205.50] And
[4205.50 → 4206.66] hear you
[4206.66 → 4210.48] River of immortal gladness,
[4210.76 → 4215.34] live us with the light of day.
[4217.00 → 4221.20] You are the one who saves,
[4221.52 → 4225.28] you are the one who saves,
[4225.28 → 4229.52] you are the one who stands
[4229.52 → 4233.72] and drops from the grave.
[4233.72 → 4238.06] You are the light of life,
[4238.50 → 4242.18] the everlasting day.
[4242.54 → 4246.50] You are the one who saves
[4246.50 → 4249.34] all our sins away.
[4251.02 → 4255.34] You are giving and forgiving,
[4256.54 → 4260.42] ever blessing, ever blessed,
[4260.42 → 4264.80] fountain of the joy of living,
[4265.16 → 4268.60] ocean depths of happiness.
[4270.88 → 4275.34] You are the one who saves,
[4275.34 → 4279.44] you are the one who saves,
[4279.44 → 4282.94] you are the one who saves,
[4283.70 → 4286.16] and drops from the grave.

[4296.32 → 4300.00] You are the one who saves,
[4300.00 → 4304.30] All our sins away
[4304.30 → 4310.04] Jesus, you are my rescue
[4310.04 → 4314.00] Jesus, you are my rescue
[4314.52 → 4321.00] I give you everything I am
[4321.00 → 4326.84] Jesus, you are my rescue
[4326.84 → 4331.26] Jesus, you are my rescue
[4331.26 → 4338.28] I give you everything I am
[4338.28 → 4343.78] Joyful, joyful, we adore you
[4343.78 → 4347.92] Not a glory nor a blood
[4347.92 → 4352.30] Hearts unfold like clouds before you
[4352.30 → 4356.72] Hold me to the Son of Thine
[4356.72 → 4362.74] You are the one who saves
[4362.74 → 4366.96] You are the one who saves
[4366.96 → 4371.04] You are the one whose hands
[4371.04 → 4374.72] Wilt us from the grave

[4379.44 → 4383.06] We are the lost in vain
[4383.06 → 4387.16] You are the one whose hands
[4387.16 → 4390.72] All our sins away
[4390.72 → 4402.28] Just want to remind everyone
[4402.28 → 4403.20] Before I bless you
[4403.20 → 4404.78] Before the Lord blesses you
[4404.78 → 4405.84] I'll make that correction
[4405.84 → 4409.34] That we will continue our rejoicing in the Lord
[4409.34 → 4410.86] Tonight at 4pm
[4410.86 → 4413.24] At the O Holy Night worship service
[4413.24 → 4415.76] And also youth and young adults
[4415.76 → 4417.54] Remember your events surrounding
[4417.54 → 4419.00] That awesome moment
[4419.00 → 4420.34] That we are all going to rejoice the Lord in
[4420.34 → 4421.54] Here is the blessing
[4421.54 → 4422.34] From God
[4422.34 → 4425.14] The Lord bless you
[4425.14 → 4425.98] And keep you
[4425.98 → 4428.02] The Lord make His face shine on you
[4428.02 → 4429.38] And be gracious to you
[4429.38 → 4431.24] The Lord turn His face towards you
[4431.24 → 4432.28] And give you peace
[4432.28 → 4443.50] Joy to the world
[4443.50 → 4447.62] The Lord is come
[4447.62 → 4457.56] Joy to the world
[4457.56 → 4460.90] The Lord is come
[4460.90 → 4467.90] Let all receive the peace
[4467.90 → 4476.52] Let every heart prepare Him
[4476.52 → 4481.90] And heaven and nature sing
[4481.90 → 4486.06] And heaven and nature sing
[4486.06 → 4494.90] And heaven and nature sing
[4494.90 → 4500.58] Joy to the earth
[4500.58 → 4503.90] The Saviour reigns
[4503.90 → 4505.08] And rooftop song
[4505.08 → 4518.56] And heaven and nature sing
[4518.56 → 4519.32] And what's of the hero titled

[4529.20 → 4538.34] Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.
[4540.46 → 4547.58] No more let sin and sorrow grow,
[4547.58 → 4554.58] nor thoughts in flesh and brow.
[4556.20 → 4563.92] He comes to let His blessings flow,
[4564.26 → 4571.58] for else the curse is found,
[4571.58 → 4579.92] for else the curse fills down.
[4581.58 → 4588.96] He was the world with truth and grace,
[4589.20 → 4594.58] and made salvation's praise.
[4594.58 → 4602.80] The qualities of His righteousness,
[4604.18 → 4607.38] and wonders of His love,
[4607.58 → 4610.98] and wonders of His love,
[4611.30 → 4618.58] and wonders, wonders of His love.
[4618.58 → 4628.58] The love of His love,
[4628.58 → 4630.58] and wonders of His love.
[4630.58 → 4637.58] The love of His love,
[4637.58 → 4639.58] and wonders of His love.
