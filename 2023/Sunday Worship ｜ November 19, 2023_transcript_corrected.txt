[425.20 → 431.70] the one of whom we heard the prophet speak

[605.62 → 607.22] because of that
[607.22 → 608.90] thank you for being with us
[608.90 → 610.54] and for supporting
[610.54 → 612.00] Warren and Mel
[612.00 → 613.50] in this journey
[613.50 → 614.06] of faith
[614.06 → 614.60] together
[614.60 → 616.44] before we begin
[616.44 → 617.02] there are a couple
[617.02 → 617.46] announcements
[617.46 → 618.18] and so I'm going to get
[618.18 → 619.40] Kevin to make his way
[619.40 → 620.06] up to the front
[620.06 → 621.08] and he's going to do
[621.08 → 621.58] an announcement
[621.58 → 623.10] on behalf of
[623.10 → 623.92] the youth ministry
[623.92 → 626.40] good morning
[626.40 → 627.22] everyone
[627.22 → 628.96] a couple of announcements
[628.96 → 629.78] for youth
[629.78 → 630.30] youth tonight
[630.30 → 631.10] we've got 2020
[631.10 → 632.24] here at the church
[632.24 → 633.34] it starts at 630
[633.34 → 634.06] so I look forward
[634.06 → 634.64] to seeing you
[634.64 → 635.46] out to that
[635.46 → 636.58] congregation
[636.58 → 637.82] once a month
[637.82 → 638.68] our youth ministry
[638.68 → 639.14] does something
[639.14 → 640.08] called youth coffee
[640.08 → 642.20] where after the morning service
[642.20 → 643.18] the youth ministry
[643.18 → 644.64] comes over to someone's house
[644.64 → 645.56] and we have lunch
[645.56 → 646.32] and we hang out
[646.32 → 647.28] the youth leaders
[647.28 → 648.50] are more than happy
[648.50 → 649.06] to help
[649.06 → 650.18] with the food
[650.18 → 650.92] and stuff like that
[650.92 → 651.72] but we're always looking
[651.72 → 653.00] for a space to come
[653.00 → 655.02] I have volunteers
[655.02 → 656.12] there's a sign-up
[656.12 → 656.84] in the bulletin
[656.84 → 657.62] that comes out
[657.62 → 658.50] I have volunteers
[658.50 → 660.58] for January
[660.58 → 661.12] February
[661.12 → 661.50] March
[661.50 → 661.96] and April
[661.96 → 663.16] but I'm still looking
[663.16 → 664.32] for one in December
[664.32 → 665.32] so if that's something
[665.32 → 666.34] that piques your interest
[666.34 → 667.58] if you're thinking
[667.58 → 668.18] oh I would love
[668.18 → 669.02] to have the youth ministry
[669.02 → 669.86] over to my house
[669.86 → 671.76] please come chat with me
[671.76 → 672.70] or you can go onto
[672.70 → 673.32] that e-bulletin
[673.32 → 674.14] and sign up there
[674.14 → 675.34] and I'm also looking
[675.34 → 675.78] for someone
[675.78 → 676.42] a little bit later
[676.42 → 676.84] in the year
[676.84 → 677.34] in May
[677.34 → 678.10] so if that's something
[678.10 → 678.94] that you're interested in
[678.94 → 680.26] please come chat with me
[680.26 → 681.22] I'd love to talk more
[681.22 → 681.60] about that
[681.60 → 682.08] thanks
[682.08 → 684.40] Kevin that's ordinarily
[684.40 → 685.48] the first Sunday
[685.48 → 686.04] of the month

[687.70 → 688.72] so that's the first
[688.72 → 689.40] Sunday in December
[689.40 → 691.06] like not next one
[691.06 → 691.98] but the following one
[691.98 → 693.00] that's what I'm looking
[693.00 → 693.50] for help with
[693.50 → 694.46] there it is
[694.46 → 695.24] December 3rd
[695.24 → 695.74] thanks Nora
[695.74 → 700.36] also just wanted to
[700.36 → 702.08] share a thank you
[702.08 → 703.54] to those of you
[703.54 → 704.44] who came out
[704.44 → 705.88] this past week
[705.88 → 706.68] on Tuesday night
[706.68 → 708.04] we had a prayer meeting
[708.04 → 709.56] in the foyer there
[709.56 → 710.92] and that was an excellent evening
[710.92 → 712.64] and the spirit was alive
[712.64 → 713.24] and moving
[713.24 → 714.36] in our midst
[714.36 → 715.20] and in our prayers
[715.20 → 716.36] and so if you were there
[716.36 → 717.32] thank you for that
[717.32 → 719.52] if you weren't there
[719.52 → 720.90] but joined us in prayer
[720.90 → 721.86] from wherever you were
[721.86 → 723.06] thank you for that
[723.06 → 724.72] we are definitely
[724.72 → 726.90] experiencing the spirit
[726.90 → 727.34] at work
[727.34 → 728.02] in our midst
[728.02 → 728.82] and we're grateful
[728.82 → 729.44] for that
[729.44 → 730.86] in our time together
[730.86 → 732.18] also
[732.18 → 734.18] a big thank you
[734.18 → 735.48] to you
[735.48 → 736.44] as church family
[736.44 → 737.36] and your friends
[737.36 → 738.40] and extended family
[738.40 → 739.42] and your co-workers
[739.42 → 741.66] for the incredible support
[741.66 → 743.12] that the GEMS ministry
[743.12 → 745.48] which is a girls' ministry here
[745.48 → 747.54] received for their GEMS jars
[747.54 → 749.84] so they make these
[749.84 → 751.40] mason jars
[751.40 → 753.12] with baking recipes in them
[753.12 → 757.66] they sold 799 jars
[757.66 → 759.22] yeah
[759.22 → 762.42] that's incredible
[762.42 → 764.52] and that's in no small part
[764.52 → 765.36] thanks to you
[765.36 → 766.70] supporting that ministry
[766.70 → 767.70] now what that means
[767.70 → 769.98] is that if you bought jars
[769.98 → 770.80] last year
[770.80 → 772.08] and then never returned them
[772.08 → 773.58] please return them
[773.58 → 775.82] by Friday
[775.82 → 778.14] they need
[778.14 → 780.60] some 400 more jars
[780.60 → 781.50] than anticipated
[781.50 → 783.00] so
[783.00 → 784.58] if you can help them out
[784.58 → 786.00] you can talk to either
[786.00 → 787.08] Rachel or Nikki
[787.08 → 789.00] and they would love
[789.00 → 790.76] to receive your help
[790.76 → 792.16] to help facilitate this
[792.16 → 793.56] in their work together
[793.56 → 795.88] I think that's it
[795.88 → 798.00] can we stand together
[798.00 → 799.72] and be welcomed by God
[799.72 → 800.72] in his presence
[800.72 → 805.28] God meets us here
[805.28 → 806.26] and we mark that
[806.26 → 807.62] with his greeting
[807.62 → 808.84] and so open your heart
[808.84 → 809.58] open your hands
[809.58 → 810.58] receive the greeting
[810.58 → 811.84] of our God
[811.84 → 813.56] grace
[813.56 → 814.80] mercy
[814.80 → 815.90] and peace to you
[815.90 → 817.36] from God our Father
[817.36 → 818.70] from the Lord Jesus Christ
[818.70 → 819.26] Son
[819.26 → 820.30] and our Saviour
[820.30 → 821.40] through the presence
[821.40 → 822.02] and power
[822.02 → 823.24] of the Holy Spirit
[823.24 → 824.62] Amen
[824.62 → 826.30] I'm going to invite you
[826.30 → 827.50] to turn to those around you
[827.50 → 828.62] and welcome them
[828.62 → 829.96] into our shared worship
[829.96 → 830.78] together this morning
[830.78 → 832.62] Amen
[832.62 → 834.62] Amen
[858.62 → 864.46] Good morning
[864.46 → 867.06] Our call to worship
[867.06 → 867.72] this morning
[867.72 → 869.12] is a selection of verses
[869.12 → 870.78] from Psalm 139
[870.78 → 871.76] and are especially
[871.76 → 872.92] appropriate this morning
[872.92 → 874.26] as we have the privilege
[874.26 → 875.72] of witnessing the baptism
[875.72 → 878.46] of Georgia Heroes
[878.46 → 880.92] The overwhelming theme
[880.92 → 882.50] of Psalm 139
[882.50 → 883.36] is that our God
[883.36 → 883.96] and Creator
[883.96 → 885.30] not only knows us
[885.30 → 885.86] intimately
[885.86 → 887.64] but remains present
[887.64 → 888.20] with us
[888.20 → 889.28] throughout our lives
[889.28 → 890.78] Hear these words
[890.78 → 892.34] of David
[892.34 → 893.66] in Psalm 139
[893.66 → 895.46] You have searched me
[895.46 → 895.78] Lord
[895.78 → 896.74] and you know me
[896.74 → 898.62] You know when I sit
[898.62 → 899.80] and when I rise
[899.80 → 901.50] You perceive my thoughts
[901.50 → 902.28] from afar
[902.28 → 904.60] You discern my going out
[904.60 → 905.78] and my lying down
[905.78 → 907.40] You are familiar
[907.40 → 908.96] with all of my ways
[908.96 → 910.32] Before a word
[910.32 → 911.24] is on my tongue
[911.24 → 912.46] You, Lord
[912.46 → 913.56] know it completely
[913.56 → 915.26] For you created
[915.26 → 916.38] my inmost being
[916.38 → 918.04] You knit me together
[918.04 → 919.22] in my mother's womb
[919.22 → 921.04] I praise you
[921.04 → 922.56] because I am fearfully
[922.56 → 923.92] and wonderfully made
[923.92 → 925.72] Your works are wonderful
[925.72 → 927.42] I know that full well
[927.42 → 929.42] My frame was not hidden
[929.42 → 929.96] from you
[929.96 → 930.86] when I was made
[930.86 → 931.96] in the secret place
[931.96 → 933.80] when I was woven together
[933.80 → 935.20] in the depths of the earth
[935.20 → 936.82] Your eyes
[936.82 → 938.62] saw my unformed body
[938.62 → 939.90] All the days
[939.90 → 940.70] ordained for me
[940.70 → 941.96] were written in your book
[941.96 → 943.16] before one of them
[943.16 → 943.88] came to be
[943.88 → 945.90] How precious to me
[945.90 → 947.18] are your thoughts, God
[947.18 → 949.76] How vast is the sum of them
[949.76 → 951.56] Were I to count them
[951.56 → 952.80] they would outnumber
[952.80 → 953.94] the grains of sand
[953.94 → 955.44] When I awake
[955.44 → 956.90] I am still with you
[956.90 → 959.32] Let's worship our God together
[959.32 → 961.22] Those who grew up
[961.26 → 963.32] and I'm still with you
[963.32 → 964.22] I am still with you
[964.22 → 964.98] In the midst of the air
[964.98 → 966.10] Aren't you
[966.10 → 966.24] Holland
[966.24 → 967.22] I am still with you
[967.28 → 967.68] You can write
[968.00 → 968.24] I am just
[968.26 → 970.02] I am still with you
[970.02 → 970.94] and I am sure
[970.94 → 971.80] I am still with you
[971.80 → 972.78] I am still with you
[972.78 → 973.44] I am still with you
[977.40 → 977.98] Muslim
[977.98 → 978.36] Welcome
[978.36 → 979.52] I am now
[979.52 → 980.32] You can live
[980.32 → 981.24] My students
[981.24 → 982.64] Better
[982.64 → 984.06] but only
[984.06 → 984.64] You can rain
[984.64 → 984.80] It's
[985.40 → 986.14] I am still with you
[986.14 → 986.70] I am still with you
[986.70 → 987.36] I am still with you
[987.52 → 988.44] I am still with you
[988.44 → 999.46] Light of the world, you step down into darkness. Open my eyes and we see.
[1001.04 → 1011.32] Beauty the way is on the door. Hope of a life's in within.
[1011.32 → 1027.22] Here I am to worship. Here I am to bow down. Here I am to sing out for my God.
[1027.22 → 1038.96] All together loving. All together worthy. All together wonderful to me.
[1041.32 → 1045.16] Thank you.
[1045.16 → 1054.66] In all ways I'm so widely exalted, glorious in heaven alone.
[1057.50 → 1068.36] Only your babe to the earth, your creator, all you're allowing me in your firm.
[1068.36 → 1074.00] Here I am to worship
[1074.00 → 1077.42] Here I am to bow down
[1077.42 → 1080.64] Here I am to save you
[1080.64 → 1083.12] You're my God
[1083.12 → 1086.62] We're altogether lovely
[1086.62 → 1089.78] We're altogether worthy
[1089.78 → 1094.98] We're altogether wonderful to be
[1094.98 → 1106.22] I'll never know how much it comes
[1106.22 → 1112.40] To see my sin upon the cross
[1112.40 → 1118.66] I'll never know how much it comes
[1118.66 → 1124.80] To see my sin upon the cross
[1124.80 → 1130.14] Here I am to worship
[1130.14 → 1133.62] Here I am to bow down
[1133.62 → 1136.96] Here I am to say that
[1136.96 → 1139.56] You're my God
[1139.56 → 1143.00] We're altogether lovely
[1143.00 → 1146.22] We're altogether worthy
[1146.22 → 1151.80] We're altogether wonderful to be
[1151.80 → 1160.16] And I've got Quran
[1161.12 → 1162.10] I'm here now
[1162.10 → 1163.62] We're altogether wealthy
[1163.62 → 1164.20] We're altogether worthy
[1164.20 → 1172.70] We're also at
[1172.70 → 1173.70] Amen.
[1202.70 → 1204.70] Amen.
[1232.70 → 1234.70] Amen.
[1262.70 → 1263.70] Amen.
[1292.70 → 1294.70] Amen.
[1322.70 → 1324.70] Amen.
[1352.70 → 1354.70] Amen.
[1382.70 → 1384.70] Amen.
[1412.70 → 1414.70] Amen.
[1442.70 → 1462.00] You may be seated.
[1467.00 → 1468.90] Let's bow our heads in prayer.
[1472.70 → 1484.74] Holy and merciful God, our creator, our defender, in your presence we confess our offences against you, our sinfulness and our shortcomings.
[1485.96 → 1489.84] In Psalm 139 we heard of how intimately you know each of us.
[1490.46 → 1495.04] We have to admit that often that can be both comforting but also humbling.
[1496.10 → 1497.92] Only you alone know our hearts.
[1497.92 → 1504.08] Only you know how often we have sinned and how often we have wandered from your ways.
[1504.78 → 1508.16] We have acted in ways that are not at all Christ-like.
[1509.12 → 1513.12] We have not honoured you in our thoughts, our words, or our deeds.
[1513.78 → 1517.20] Have mercy on us, Lord, for we are ashamed and sorry.
[1517.20 → 1523.64] We know that it is our sins for which you willingly suffered and died an earthly death.
[1524.06 → 1526.14] And we don't ever want to take that for granted.
[1526.66 → 1527.50] We're so grateful.
[1528.44 → 1529.18] Help us, Lord.
[1530.08 → 1531.26] Purify our hearts.
[1532.04 → 1535.08] Help us to live every day in your light and in your ways.
[1535.86 → 1537.02] Thank you for the cross.
[1537.78 → 1540.02] Jesus, take our lives and lead us on.
[1540.24 → 1542.44] May we be a sacrifice to you.
[1542.44 → 1545.00] In your precious name alone we pray.
[1545.52 → 1545.86] Amen.
[1545.86 → 1545.98] Amen.
[1572.44 → 1580.18] Lord, you have my heart.
[1580.18 → 1586.10] And I will search for yours.
[1587.52 → 1594.68] Jesus, take my life and lead me on.
[1594.68 → 1602.42] Lord, you have my heart.
[1602.42 → 1608.60] And I will search for yours.
[1609.60 → 1615.42] Can we be to you a sacrifice?
[1615.42 → 1645.40] Lord, you have my heart.
[1645.40 → 1653.14] Lord, you have my heart.
[1653.14 → 1659.14] And I will search for yours.
[1659.14 → 1666.88] Lord, you have my heart.
[1666.88 → 1670.88] And I will search for yours.
[1671.88 → 1678.88] Jesus, take my life and lead me on.
[1678.88 → 1686.62] Lord, you have my heart.
[1686.62 → 1691.62] And I will search for yours.
[1691.62 → 1698.62] Let me be to you a sacrifice.
[1698.62 → 1700.36] Lord, you have my heart.
[1700.36 → 1706.36] And I will praise you, Lord.
[1706.36 → 1710.36] And I will praise you, Lord.
[1710.36 → 1718.36] And I will save the blood of God.
[1718.36 → 1720.10] Lord, you have my heart.
[1720.10 → 1726.10] And I will search for yours.
[1726.10 → 1728.10] And I will search for yours.
[1728.10 → 1730.10] And I will search for yours.
[1730.10 → 1737.84] Lord, you have my heart.
[1737.84 → 1745.58] Lord, you have my heart.
[1745.58 → 1747.58] And I will search for yours.
[1747.58 → 1751.58] And I will search for yours.
[1751.58 → 1759.58] Jesus, take my life and lead me on.
[1759.58 → 1767.32] Lord, you have my heart.
[1767.32 → 1768.72] Please stand for the next song.
[1768.72 → 1772.76] Let me pray.
[1773.46 → 1782.62] Lord, you have my heart.
[1782.62 → 1785.78] Please stand for your throne.
[1785.78 → 1787.36] Amen.
[1787.36 → 1788.14] Amen.
[1788.14 → 1789.34] Amen.
[1789.34 → 1790.56] Amen.
[1790.56 → 1792.62] Amen.
[1792.62 → 1793.54] Amen.
[1793.58 → 1794.70] Amen.
[1794.70 → 1794.94] Amen.
[1794.94 → 1796.08] Amen.
[1796.08 → 1810.08] You give light, you are Lord. You bring light to the darkness and give hope.
[1810.08 → 1817.08] You restore every one that is broken.
[1817.08 → 1824.08] You bring light to the light, you are Lord.
[1824.08 → 1832.08] It's your breath in our lungs, till we pour out our praise, pour out our praise.
[1832.08 → 1842.08] It's your breath in our lungs, till we pour out our praise to all you.
[1847.08 → 1857.08] You give light, you are Lord. You bring light to the darkness and give hope.
[1857.08 → 1862.08] You give hope, you are Lord. You give hope, you are Lord.
[1862.08 → 1872.08] You give light, you are Lord. You give light, you are Lord.
[1872.08 → 1878.08] It's your breath in our lungs, till we pour out our praise.
[1878.08 → 1888.08] You give light, you are Lord. You give light, you are Lord.
[1888.08 → 1894.08] It's your breath in our lungs, till we pour out our praise.
[1894.08 → 1896.08] You give light, you are Lord.
[1896.08 → 1898.08] You give light, you are Lord.
[1898.08 → 1900.08] You give light, you are Lord.
[1900.08 → 1902.08] It's your breath in our lungs, till we pour out our praise.
[1902.08 → 1904.08] You give light, you are Lord.
[1904.08 → 1914.08] You give light, you are Lord.
[1914.08 → 1919.08] You give light, you are Lord.
[1919.08 → 1931.08] You give light, you are Lord.
[1931.08 → 1936.08] You give light, you are Lord.
[1936.08 → 1939.08] You give light, you are Lord.
[1939.08 → 1941.08] Oh
[1969.08 → 1971.08] Oh
[1999.08 → 2001.08] Oh
[2001.08 → 2003.08] Oh
[2003.08 → 2005.08] Oh
[2005.08 → 2007.08] Oh
[2007.08 → 2009.08] Oh
[2009.08 → 2011.08] Oh
[2011.08 → 2013.08] Oh
[2013.08 → 2015.08] Oh
[2015.08 → 2017.08] Oh
[2017.08 → 2019.08] Oh
[2019.08 → 2021.08] Oh
[2025.08 → 2043.08] As we began and said at the beginning we have the opportunity to welcome another family into our church family here this morning and to do that I'm going to invite the Behoove family up to the front and so Warren and Mel Amelia Matteo Josephine and Georgia are all going to invite the Behoove family up to the front.
[2043.08 → 2053.08] And so Warren and Mel Amelia Matteo Josephine and Georgia are all going to come up to the front why don't you guys come up to this part of the stage here.
[2053.08 → 2058.08] We'll start on this side, and then we'll move over here eventually.
[2058.08 → 2063.08] But here people can see us, and it makes it easier for the camera to follow where we are.
[2063.08 → 2079.08] So the Behoove have come to us from Chilliwack Alliance Church and have been worshipping with us for a little while now after moving into the neighbourhood up the hill in Marseille.
[2079.08 → 2099.08] It's our hope and prayer that here at Emmanuel your faith will be strengthened that your love for Jesus will be grown and that you will find opportunity to serve in the spirit as you join with us on mission with God in this community and through it to the world.
[2099.08 → 2112.78] As we welcome you into our church family we want to ask you to affirm faith that you have professed and been baptized in and affirm your commitment to God's mission in and through Langley Emanuel here.
[2113.70 → 2116.52] To do, so I'm going to ask three questions.
[2116.90 → 2119.34] At the end of those three questions I will invite you to respond.
[2119.86 → 2121.08] We do with God's help.
[2121.08 → 2129.48] First, do you believe in Jesus as your Saviour and Lord and that in him only is hope and freedom from sin found?
[2130.34 → 2140.46] Do you believe that the Bible is the word of God revealing his plan for redemption in Jesus Christ and that the preaching and teaching of Langley Emanuel faithfully reflect this truth?
[2140.46 → 2150.30] And do you promise with the help of the Holy Spirit to do all you can to strengthen your relationship to Jesus by being part of the life of this church family?
[2150.72 → 2159.02] Recognizing its oversight and authority and joining with us on mission for Jesus in this community, this city, and to the world.
[2159.40 → 2160.68] Warren and Mel, what is your answer?
[2161.10 → 2162.40] We do with God's help.
[2162.76 → 2163.04] Amen.
[2163.04 → 2163.20] Amen.
[2163.20 → 2163.28] Amen.
[2165.62 → 2174.32] Now as we have welcomed you in our church family, you also then receive the blessing and the privileges of baptism.
[2175.54 → 2182.58] We have welcomed you, and now we come to a service of baptism together.
[2183.52 → 2191.92] And if you are unfamiliar with the Reformed tradition and our experiences and ideas, theology around baptism,
[2191.92 → 2205.04] let me just say that we don't baptize infants out of superstition or just because of tradition or because we particularly like cute babies and even not cute babies, but none of those exist.
[2206.00 → 2217.18] We baptize infants because they are covenant children and the promises of God are extended to them, and therefore they should receive the sign of the covenant.
[2217.18 → 2222.52] In Genesis 15, God made a promise to Abraham.
[2223.24 → 2227.22] And this covenant was sealed with the sign of circumcision in Genesis 17.
[2228.08 → 2230.68] And God promised to bless Abraham.
[2231.48 → 2234.68] Now for Abraham, this meant two things in particular.
[2235.22 → 2239.40] It meant offspring, it meant babies, and it meant land.
[2239.40 → 2246.06] But at the heart of the covenant was God's promise that he would be a God to Abraham and his children.
[2247.06 → 2252.86] And God cut a covenant into Israel's flesh, carving out for himself a people.
[2254.06 → 2259.20] And in the fullness of time, God sent his only son, Jesus, to be our Saviour.
[2259.36 → 2262.98] And in his death on the cross, our old self is dead and buried.
[2262.98 → 2268.34] And in his resurrection, we rise to new life and look forward to his new creation.
[2269.72 → 2273.54] When we baptize in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
[2274.00 → 2280.94] the triune God seals our adoption as his children and writes his name invisibly on our foreheads.
[2281.46 → 2281.84] He says,
[2281.92 → 2287.36] You are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God.
[2287.54 → 2291.60] Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God.
[2291.60 → 2297.24] By baptism, we recognize a new identity in Christ Jesus.
[2298.42 → 2300.68] So if you guys shift over here.
[2303.20 → 2308.12] We come to administer the sacrament of baptism to Georgia today,
[2308.36 → 2311.90] then with the weight of church history to encourage us
[2311.90 → 2316.84] and the example of redemptive history to confirm our practice.
[2317.42 → 2320.00] We baptize in obedience to Christ's command,
[2320.00 → 2326.20] and the sacrament that we are about to administer is a sign of the inclusion into the covenant community
[2326.20 → 2327.82] as circumcision once was.
[2328.38 → 2332.54] And the water we are about to sprinkle is a sign of the cleansing from sin
[2332.54 → 2336.24] as the sprinkled blood of bulls and goats also once was.
[2337.22 → 2341.68] We pray that Georgia will take advantage of all her covenant privileges,
[2342.24 → 2344.96] that she will acknowledge her Lord all the days of her life,
[2344.96 → 2349.68] and that she will make the faith promises offered here today her own.
[2350.62 → 2351.30] Warren and Mel,
[2352.12 → 2353.80] you've shared your profession of faith already,
[2354.14 → 2355.32] but I have one more question.
[2356.36 → 2357.46] Do you promise,
[2357.86 → 2359.54] in reliance on the Holy Spirit,
[2359.62 → 2361.22] with the help of the Christian community,
[2361.60 → 2363.10] to do all in your power
[2363.10 → 2364.66] to instruct Georgia
[2364.66 → 2366.48] and all of your children
[2366.48 → 2367.86] in the Christian faith,
[2367.86 → 2369.90] and to lead them by your example
[2369.90 → 2372.68] into the life of Christian discipleship?
[2373.02 → 2373.68] What is your answer?
[2375.40 → 2375.84] Amen.
[2376.92 → 2378.10] Our Lord Jesus said,
[2378.28 → 2379.96] let the little children come to me
[2379.96 → 2381.32] and do not hinder them,
[2381.48 → 2383.84] for to them belongs the kingdom of God.
[2384.28 → 2384.78] And so,
[2384.92 → 2386.42] if you are a little child
[2386.42 → 2387.52] or a little child at heart
[2387.52 → 2388.78] and would like a better vantage point,
[2389.14 → 2391.10] I'm going to invite you to come up to the front here
[2391.10 → 2393.62] and just sit around the edge
[2393.62 → 2395.16] so that you can see
[2395.16 → 2397.42] and participate in this
[2397.42 → 2399.48] with Georgia.
[2403.74 → 2404.78] Come on, right in.
[2404.84 → 2405.38] Right in, Ruby.
[2405.48 → 2405.82] Right here.
[2405.90 → 2407.82] Take the lead and be bold in it.
[2408.18 → 2408.58] Perfect.
[2416.20 → 2417.62] In just a moment, guys,
[2417.66 → 2419.18] we're going to take this water
[2419.18 → 2422.04] and we're going to place it
[2422.04 → 2423.52] over top of Georgia's head.
[2426.88 → 2429.90] And just like you wash your bodies
[2429.90 → 2431.28] to be clean of dirt,
[2431.44 → 2435.50] God promises to wash us clean of our sin
[2435.50 → 2436.94] and to make us his own.
[2437.06 → 2440.20] That's what this water is a symbol of.
[2440.88 → 2441.82] So as you see this
[2441.82 → 2443.64] and as Georgia gets this put on her head,
[2444.10 → 2444.90] God is saying,
[2444.90 → 2446.90] you are my daughter.
[2446.90 → 2449.20] Just as he has said to many of you,
[2449.30 → 2451.10] you are my child.
[2452.74 → 2453.70] Let me put her forward here.
[2458.90 → 2459.30] Georgia,
[2459.78 → 2460.32] Ricky,
[2460.78 → 2461.20] Version.
[2461.76 → 2463.60] I baptize you in the name of the Father,
[2464.50 → 2465.60] the name of the Son,
[2466.36 → 2468.00] and the name of the Holy Spirit.
[2469.00 → 2469.36] Amen.
[2469.36 → 2469.50] Amen.
[2469.50 → 2469.54] Amen.
[2469.54 → 2469.56] Amen.
[2469.56 → 2469.62] Amen.
[2469.62 → 2469.66] Amen.
[2476.90 → 2484.00] If baptism is a symbol of the death
[2484.00 → 2485.26] and resurrection of Jesus,
[2485.44 → 2487.16] it is fitting when babies cry
[2487.16 → 2488.70] because dying and rising
[2488.70 → 2490.14] is a miracle of God
[2490.14 → 2491.24] and it is hard work.
[2495.24 → 2495.88] Georgia,
[2496.40 → 2499.02] we welcome you
[2499.02 → 2501.28] into the family of Jesus.
[2502.04 → 2503.28] And so the Lord bless you
[2503.28 → 2504.48] and keep you.
[2504.48 → 2505.16] Lord,
[2505.22 → 2506.56] make his face to shine upon you
[2506.56 → 2507.84] and be gracious to you.
[2508.22 → 2510.12] The Lord turn his face toward you
[2510.12 → 2512.62] and give you his peace.
[2513.34 → 2514.28] In this way,
[2514.40 → 2516.10] the Lord writes his name
[2516.10 → 2517.66] on Georgia
[2517.66 → 2519.58] and makes her his own.
[2520.32 → 2520.64] Amen.
[2523.82 → 2525.28] May I take her for a second?
[2528.08 → 2529.12] Hey, beautiful.
[2529.12 → 2534.44] Congregation of Jesus Christ,
[2535.24 → 2539.86] this child is a member of our family.
[2541.10 → 2543.68] As she comes to us from Warren and Mel,
[2543.88 → 2545.12] make no mistake about it,
[2545.18 → 2546.32] she comes to you
[2546.32 → 2548.40] and is now your spiritual daughter.
[2549.90 → 2551.94] And so whether you are 11
[2551.94 → 2554.86] or 111,
[2555.56 → 2557.20] she belongs to you
[2557.20 → 2558.74] just as you belong to her.
[2559.92 → 2560.24] Today,
[2560.40 → 2561.88] she begins a journey of faith
[2561.88 → 2563.34] that we hope and pray
[2563.34 → 2565.20] will one day include
[2565.20 → 2566.32] her standing again
[2566.32 → 2567.38] in front of us
[2567.38 → 2568.36] saying,
[2568.86 → 2570.00] this promise offered to me
[2570.00 → 2570.60] in baptism,
[2570.80 → 2573.74] I believe as my own.
[2574.64 → 2576.80] And you have the privilege,
[2577.44 → 2579.10] you have the responsibility
[2579.10 → 2581.36] of helping her
[2581.36 → 2583.46] in that journey.
[2583.46 → 2589.04] She is of us
[2589.04 → 2591.82] because she has the name of Jesus
[2591.82 → 2593.88] written on her forehead
[2593.88 → 2596.02] and so begins
[2596.02 → 2597.82] her journey of faith
[2597.82 → 2598.78] with you.
[2599.52 → 2600.94] And so receive her
[2600.94 → 2602.92] as your daughter
[2602.92 → 2604.46] in the Lord.
[2605.74 → 2606.38] Congregation,
[2606.52 → 2607.66] I'm going to invite you to stand
[2607.66 → 2609.02] because you too
[2609.02 → 2609.68] are going to offer
[2609.68 → 2610.80] a promise and a blessing
[2610.80 → 2612.16] to Georgia,
[2612.48 → 2613.56] to Warren and Mel.
[2621.16 → 2621.80] Congregation,
[2622.26 → 2623.48] do you promise
[2623.48 → 2624.22] to love
[2624.22 → 2624.88] and courage
[2624.88 → 2625.58] and support
[2625.58 → 2626.82] Warren and Mel,
[2627.28 → 2628.32] Georgia and Amelia
[2628.32 → 2629.08] and Mateo
[2629.08 → 2629.92] and Josephine
[2629.92 → 2630.94] by teaching
[2630.94 → 2632.02] the gospel
[2632.02 → 2632.94] of God's love,
[2633.36 → 2634.62] by being an example
[2634.62 → 2635.70] of Christian faith
[2635.70 → 2636.30] and character
[2636.30 → 2637.40] and by giving
[2637.40 → 2638.66] the strong support
[2638.66 → 2640.00] of God's family
[2640.00 → 2640.92] in fellowship
[2640.92 → 2641.78] and prayer
[2641.78 → 2642.74] and in service?
[2643.04 → 2643.90] What is your answer?
[2646.40 → 2646.88] Amen.
[2647.58 → 2648.04] Amen.
[2648.20 → 2648.74] Would you please
[2648.74 → 2650.10] have a seat together?
[2650.50 → 2651.26] Kids, you can go back
[2651.26 → 2652.54] to your...
[2652.54 → 2653.28] Would you mind just moving
[2653.28 → 2653.88] to the front
[2653.88 → 2654.68] on the ground there?
[2656.22 → 2658.18] To mark this occasion.
[2659.18 → 2660.48] Yeah, on the ground, Warren.
[2660.60 → 2661.42] So then we can...
[2661.42 → 2663.02] We have a gift for you
[2663.02 → 2663.64] and a little bit
[2663.64 → 2664.20] of a welcome
[2664.20 → 2666.24] from our church
[2666.24 → 2667.36] and a certificate
[2667.36 → 2668.40] and so I'm going to invite
[2668.40 → 2669.62] Eric Hubert up.
[2669.78 → 2670.44] He's already here.
[2670.58 → 2672.82] He is your new district elder
[2672.82 → 2674.84] and so he will connect
[2674.84 → 2675.36] with you
[2675.36 → 2678.08] and he offers you this
[2678.08 → 2679.34] on behalf of our church.
[2680.18 → 2681.36] I'm also going to ask
[2681.36 → 2682.68] that we might pray for them
[2682.68 → 2683.58] and so Kevin is going
[2683.58 → 2684.44] to come up to the front.
[2685.00 → 2685.60] He's going to lead us
[2685.60 → 2686.64] in prayer for you guys
[2686.64 → 2688.00] and so if you're an elder
[2688.00 → 2688.70] in this church
[2688.70 → 2690.22] or if you have met
[2690.22 → 2691.76] and welcomed Warren
[2691.76 → 2692.26] and Mel
[2692.26 → 2692.90] and their family
[2692.90 → 2694.52] or if you are family
[2694.52 → 2695.68] to Warren and Mel
[2695.68 → 2696.66] we invite you also
[2696.66 → 2697.38] to come up
[2697.38 → 2698.30] and we can lay hands
[2698.30 → 2698.74] on them
[2698.74 → 2700.46] and welcome them
[2700.46 → 2700.98] in that way.
[2701.88 → 2702.88] If you aren't going
[2702.88 → 2703.50] to come up
[2703.50 → 2704.24] but would like to
[2704.24 → 2705.14] you may also just
[2705.14 → 2706.10] stick out your hand
[2706.10 → 2707.56] and welcome them
[2707.56 → 2708.82] in our midst that way.
[2709.68 → 2710.70] Kevin is going to pray.
[2719.34 → 2720.32] Let's bow our heads.
[2720.32 → 2722.32] Holy Father,
[2722.32 → 2722.34] Holy Father,
[2722.82 → 2724.06] Son, Spirit,
[2724.16 → 2724.88] we are grateful
[2724.88 → 2726.48] that we can come here today
[2726.48 → 2727.80] and be present here
[2727.80 → 2728.46] to witness
[2728.46 → 2729.82] the baptism
[2729.82 → 2730.90] of Georgia Verboten.
[2731.38 → 2732.18] Lord, we thank you
[2732.18 → 2733.62] for the Verboten family,
[2733.76 → 2734.12] for Mel,
[2734.24 → 2734.66] for Warren,
[2734.72 → 2735.36] that they have come
[2735.36 → 2736.30] into this place
[2736.30 → 2737.24] to become part
[2737.24 → 2738.22] of this congregation,
[2738.42 → 2739.00] this body
[2739.00 → 2739.70] and Lord,
[2739.78 → 2740.38] we are grateful
[2740.38 → 2741.74] that they have committed
[2741.74 → 2742.66] to this church
[2742.66 → 2744.02] just like so many
[2744.02 → 2744.64] of us here
[2744.64 → 2745.84] and Lord,
[2745.92 → 2747.06] as they go forward
[2747.06 → 2748.72] knowing the promises
[2748.72 → 2749.64] that you have laid out
[2749.64 → 2750.60] not just for them
[2750.60 → 2751.70] but for all of us,
[2752.12 → 2752.94] that may we revel
[2752.94 → 2753.54] in that
[2753.54 → 2754.72] and may we sit
[2754.72 → 2755.32] in that
[2755.32 → 2757.06] and may we be confident
[2757.06 → 2758.28] in those promises
[2758.28 → 2759.98] that you are our God
[2759.98 → 2760.94] and that you are
[2760.94 → 2761.80] with us always.
[2762.80 → 2763.36] We thank you
[2763.36 → 2764.08] for this family
[2764.08 → 2764.62] and we pray
[2764.62 → 2765.44] that you will continue
[2765.44 → 2766.80] to walk alongside them
[2766.80 → 2769.66] and may they glorify you
[2769.66 → 2770.72] in everything
[2770.72 → 2771.84] they say and do
[2771.84 → 2773.08] and Lord,
[2773.18 → 2774.36] may we as a congregation
[2774.36 → 2775.18] do this thing.
[2775.68 → 2776.66] We pray this in your name.
[2777.06 → 2777.30] Amen.
[2777.30 → 2777.96] Amen.
[2783.84 → 2784.74] Thanks guys.
[2792.54 → 2793.86] Let's stand together
[2793.86 → 2794.50] and sing
[2794.50 → 2795.78] of God's faithfulness.
[2795.78 → 2796.78] Amen.
[2807.30 → 2808.30] Amen.
[2837.30 → 2843.84] Great is thy faithfulness,
[2843.84 → 2848.34] O God my Father,
[2849.34 → 2852.74] There is no shadow
[2852.74 → 2856.84] of turning with thee.
[2856.84 → 2860.84] Thou changeest God,
[2860.92 → 2862.60] Thy compassion,
[2863.12 → 2865.16] sing them all.
[2865.16 → 2868.84] As thou hast been,
[2868.84 → 2872.60] Thou forever will be.
[2872.60 → 2877.50] Great is thy faithfulness,
[2877.50 → 2881.40] Great is thy faithfulness,
[2881.40 → 2884.42] For in thy Lord,
[2884.54 → 2888.60] In mercies I see,
[2888.60 → 2900.18] Though I know
[2900.18 → 2909.02] I know where Beth-
[2909.02 → 2922.30] And winter and springtime and harvest, sun, moon, and stars in their courses above.
[2922.30 → 2940.30] Joy with all nature in manifold witness, to thy great faithfulness, mercy, and love.
[2940.30 → 2957.06] Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness, morning by morning new mercies I see.
[2957.06 → 2972.18] All I am here is thy land that provided, great is thy faithfulness, Lord, and true.
[2972.18 → 2973.18] Amen.
[3002.18 → 3003.18] Amen.
[3003.18 → 3004.18] Amen.
[3032.18 → 3038.66] Great is thy faithfulness, Lord, and true.
[3038.66 → 3039.66] Amen.
[3054.04 → 3054.76] Good morning.
[3054.94 → 3057.84] My name is Mike, and I serve as a deacon here in the church family.
[3057.84 → 3062.46] And we're going to take a moment now to give of the blessings that God has given to us.
[3063.00 → 3066.36] And this morning we're giving to the Wycliffe Bible Translators.
[3066.86 → 3070.38] So they are a pretty great little organization.
[3070.80 → 3072.48] They focus on translating the Bible.
[3072.64 → 3073.86] And it's more than that.
[3073.96 → 3077.38] They also focus on literacy and education for people groups.
[3077.86 → 3082.70] So they spend a lot of time focusing on actually minority groups who either don't have a written language
[3082.70 → 3086.42] and then, of course, would not have the Bible accessible in their language.
[3086.72 → 3087.78] So it's pretty cool.
[3087.84 → 3088.74] What they do.
[3089.16 → 3095.06] And Wycliffe Canada actually has some major projects going on in Cameroon, the Dominican Republic,
[3095.44 → 3099.46] or not Dominican Republic, sorry, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and with the Cree Nation
[3099.46 → 3100.54] in North America here.
[3101.10 → 3107.60] So, yeah, they work with a lot of local people, local churches, and helping people to access
[3107.60 → 3108.36] the word of the Lord.
[3108.54 → 3109.24] It's pretty great work.
[3109.64 → 3112.94] So please give willingly and freely.
[3113.06 → 3113.40] Thank you.
[3113.40 → 3113.46] Thank you.
[3113.46 → 3114.46] Thank you.
[3114.46 → 3115.46] Thank you.
[3115.46 → 3116.46] Thank you.
[3116.46 → 3117.46] Thank you.
[3117.46 → 3122.24] Thank you.
[3122.24 → 3152.22] Thank you.
[3152.24 → 3182.22] Thank you.
[3182.24 → 3212.22] Thank you.
[3212.24 → 3242.22] Thank you.
[3242.24 → 3248.46] Praise God, praise God, from whom all blessings flow.
[3249.58 → 3257.62] Praise Him, praise Him, for the wonders of His love.
[3257.62 → 3265.84] Praise God, praise God, from whom all blessings flow.
[3265.84 → 3274.84] Praise Him, praise Him, for the wonders of His love.
[3274.84 → 3292.06] Praise God, praise Him, for the wonders of His love.
[3292.06 → 3300.28] Praise God, praise Him, for the wonders of His love.
[3300.28 → 3302.28] Praise God, praise Him, for the wonders of His love.
[3302.28 → 3309.58] Praise God, praise God, forever He is, we know it is well.
[3309.58 → 3315.80] I'm walking in peace.
[3315.80 → 3317.80] God so loved the world.
[3317.80 → 3326.02] All right.
[3326.02 → 3327.02] All right.
[3327.02 → 3343.24] All right.
[3343.24 → 3344.08] All right, kids.
[3344.08 → 3344.46] All right.
[3344.46 → 3360.46] All right.
[3360.90 → 3364.52] Hello, how are we all doing today?
[3364.52 → 3364.60] Good.
[3364.68 → 3365.68] Good.
[3365.68 → 3365.72] Good.
[3365.80 → 3367.18] Can you guys say hi to Hank?
[3367.68 → 3370.20] Hi, everyone.
[3371.02 → 3372.68] How are you?
[3373.68 → 3374.40] Good.
[3374.40 → 3390.40] What? Hey, I have a question. What did we do here in Kids Corner last week? Do you remember? Yeah. We did. We just baptized your little sister. That's so right. And what do you remember what we did here last week? Yeah.
[3390.40 → 3419.46] That's right. We learned how to welcome each other in different languages. Hank, you missed out. That sounds neat. And we made the whole church do it too, right? They all stood up, and we learned how people greeted each other in places like Tibet and Japan. Did you do dogs? Sorry? Did you do dogs last week? No, we didn't do dogs. We did different countries. Dogs greet themselves in cool ways too. Everyone stand up.
[3419.46 → 3437.86] And I need you to bend over at the hip. Okay. Oh, no, no, no. We're not going to do the dog greeting, Hank. That's not, we're not doing that today. We did that last week. Mrs. Nikki led us in that, right? Yeah. Is she the lady who sat on me? Yeah, she did like two years ago and you haven't given it up since. It hurt me a little.
[3437.86 → 3451.06] All right. Well, today we're going to talk about some other things. And actually, Hank, I was wondering if you could do us a favour. I think you presented or created a little bit of a presentation for us because you went on a trip, which we learned about a month ago.
[3451.42 → 3453.86] I did by mistake, but I did.
[3454.40 → 3459.06] He went all over the world, and he saw all sorts of things. Can you show us, Hank?
[3459.16 → 3460.30] Yeah, look at the pictures.
[3460.30 → 3480.26] So here's Hank at Bridal Falls in BC. Cool, Hank. And then I went out to the Ontario and saw Niagara Falls. Isn't that nice? You used to live near there, right? And then he went even further. Look at this. That's him in the United States at Yosemite Falls.
[3480.26 → 3507.60] I don't really see you, Hank, though. Where are you? I'm up at the top. Oh, yeah. There you are. I was there for four days. Four days? My guy forgot me at the top of the hill. Oh, that's too bad. It was so beautiful, though. Well, where else did you go, Hank? Let's see. We went to Skagafoss Falls. Whoa, that was in Iceland. And where else? We went, you guys went to Victoria Falls in Zambia?
[3507.60 → 3517.84] Mm-hmm. It was huge. And we did one more too in Venezuela. Or Angel Falls in Venezuela. Cool. Isn't that so cool?
[3518.52 → 3522.02] Now, why do you think we want to talk about falls today? I bet you'll never guess.
[3523.20 → 3531.64] Well, we are talking in Sunday school, in children's worship time, about how brokenness has entered the world through the fall of man. See the link?
[3531.82 → 3537.02] And how God works through us, even in our brokenness. Isn't that something?
[3537.02 → 3542.60] Good work. Thank you. And so we're going to talk about that today in children's worship time, okay?
[3543.20 → 3545.98] Can we bow our heads and pray? Yeah? Let's do that.
[3546.80 → 3551.20] Dear God, we thank you that we can come to church this morning, and we can go to children's worship time today as well.
[3551.26 → 3556.40] We pray, God, that as we talk about how you work through our weaknesses, that we will be blessed by that.
[3556.48 → 3560.10] We pray for the adults, too, as they stay back here and learn from Pastor Chris as well.
[3560.22 → 3564.14] And God, we just ask that you are glorified by everything that happens here today.
[3564.14 → 3565.84] We pray this in your name. Amen.
[3566.48 → 3569.46] Okay, we're going to stand up and do the Lord, or the children's blessing, okay?
[3569.70 → 3573.20] So everybody stand up and let's do this together.
[3573.36 → 3575.06] We're going to say, the Lord be with you. Are we ready?
[3576.06 → 3578.14] The Lord be with you.
[3578.54 → 3579.98] And also with you.
[3580.28 → 3581.20] All right, you know where you're going.
[3581.20 → 3581.70] Yes!
[3585.70 → 3586.02] Yes!
[3586.02 → 3604.92] Good morning.
[3605.74 → 3608.14] My name is Daryl. I'm one of the elders here at Emanuel.
[3608.74 → 3611.80] I just have a few announcements before we get into the church family prayer.
[3611.80 → 3614.48] So next week is our annual AGM.
[3615.38 → 3619.52] And so we will be talking about the 2024 ministry and mission budget.
[3620.12 → 3625.02] We also will gather for the at 6 p.m., a little bit earlier, for the Trisomy Tournament.
[3625.98 → 3628.18] So looking forward to seeing what everyone can bring.
[3628.48 → 3632.72] I'm not competitive at all, so you won't be worrying about my soup.
[3632.72 → 3640.38] And then also, as of October 31st, we are about 24% behind on the year-to-date giving.
[3641.08 → 3645.66] So we are grateful for everyone's generosity to this point, and we just hope that we can finish the year off strong.
[3646.42 → 3648.88] And we can support all those ministries in our church.
[3649.84 → 3652.14] A couple of updates for prayer requests as well.
[3653.00 → 3660.10] SAI Kisser is back in the hospital, and so he underwent, so he went back into the hospital due to severe pain in his shoulder.
[3660.10 → 3665.62] And they learned that, unfortunately, the cancer that he was in remission from is back.
[3666.24 → 3667.44] And so we pray for SAI and Greta.
[3668.24 → 3670.60] And they are also very thankful for your prayers.
[3671.64 → 3673.12] We pray for Judy Prestige.
[3673.88 → 3675.24] It's her daughter-in-law, Nicole.
[3675.84 → 3680.08] Wife to Dan was taken to hospital Friday night after her heart stopped.
[3680.70 → 3684.26] So they did revive her, and they're treating her for various concerns.
[3684.50 → 3686.60] So we pray for that family.
[3686.60 → 3692.38] And just an update on Weenie Friend as well, a mom to Brenda and Linda and Jody.
[3693.04 → 3694.20] She remains in hospice.
[3694.96 → 3697.72] And they are watching right now, so hello, Weenie and family.
[3698.64 → 3705.28] We just continue to pray for the peace of Christ in the face of death and the hope of resurrection as they journey in this valley of the shadow.
[3705.70 → 3708.52] The family is grateful for all of your prayers and support as well.
[3708.52 → 3710.48] And one last prayer update.
[3710.74 → 3714.24] Rob Alabama's niece, Lindsay, in Ontario, has just passed away.
[3714.68 → 3715.76] So the funeral is today.
[3716.00 → 3718.86] So we pray for Rob and his siblings who are out in Ontario at the moment.
[3721.02 → 3723.20] Let's go to God in our church family prayer.
[3723.20 → 3734.80] Father in heaven, we come before you in thanks this morning for the gift of joining together in worship and fellowship.
[3735.62 → 3740.40] As we come before you, we are grateful for your love and grace that sustains us each day.
[3741.30 → 3745.88] We confess, Lord, that we often fall short of reflecting your love and grace in our lives.
[3745.88 → 3756.02] Forgive us for the times we have turned away from your will, for your harsh selfishness, and for the moments we have failed to extend compassion and kindness to others.
[3756.52 → 3762.66] Grant us hearts eager to seek reconciliation and humility to follow in the footsteps of Christ.
[3763.60 → 3767.60] Please be with the Hogawoning-Hibbenike families as they grieve the loss of loved ones.
[3768.20 → 3771.32] Give them comfort as they have the memorial services this week.
[3771.32 → 3776.64] Please be with Mini Green and her family as she is now in palliative care.
[3777.36 → 3784.66] We also pray for the many others who are struggling with health concerns, whether they be known, unknown, physical, mental, or emotional.
[3785.32 → 3790.84] Many suffer in silence, and we pray you open their hearts to those around them who can help and support them
[3790.84 → 3794.44] and give us what we need to be there for those in our lives we can help.
[3795.22 → 3800.90] In a world filled with turmoil and uncertainty, we lift our prayers for healing and peace.
[3800.90 → 3803.82] We pray for those affected by the war in Ukraine and Israel.
[3804.48 → 3809.06] Please give wisdom to the leaders as they make decisions that can have long-lasting impacts on their citizens.
[3809.98 → 3816.88] We think of your word in Luke 21, and then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with great power and great glory.
[3817.40 → 3823.24] Now when these things begin to take place, straighten up and raise your heads because your redemption is drawing near.
[3824.08 → 3827.26] What hope and encouragement we can take from your word, O Lord.
[3827.26 → 3831.74] Be with those that are struggling in their faith and continue to work in their hearts.
[3832.22 → 3835.54] We pray for Pastor Chris as he brings us your word this morning.
[3836.12 → 3838.90] May you speak through him and convict us through your word.
[3839.42 → 3843.06] As we continue on this journey of faith together, deepen our understanding of your word.
[3843.68 → 3848.00] Open our hearts to receive your teachings and empower us to live out the gospel in our daily lives.
[3848.68 → 3852.32] Help us to be a light in our communities, sharing your love and grace with everyone we encounter.
[3852.32 → 3860.28] Lord, we thank you for the blessing that overflows in our lives, the joy of fellowship, and for the privilege of worshipping you together.
[3860.58 → 3862.98] May your spirit continue to guide us and empower us.
[3863.74 → 3867.22] We pray this in the name of Jesus Christ, our Saviour and Redeemer. Amen.
[3867.22 → 3867.32] Amen.
[3867.32 → 3867.38] Amen.
[3882.32 → 3883.32] Amen.
[3883.32 → 3884.32] Amen.
[3884.32 → 3885.32] Amen.
[3885.32 → 3886.32] Amen.
[3886.32 → 3887.32] Amen.
[3887.32 → 3888.32] Amen.
[3888.32 → 3896.72] Over the last while, we have been working hard in working our way through the book of Romans,
[3897.10 → 3901.36] in particular, more recently, chapters 9 through 11.
[3902.06 → 3907.62] We continue with that this morning, reading chapter 11, the first 10 verses.
[3907.62 → 3911.16] It will be on the screen behind me, our first time through it.
[3911.62 → 3916.40] But if you have a Bible, I encourage you, as always, to open that up, to have that in front of you,
[3916.46 → 3921.26] as we will be making reference and doing a little bit of jumping around.
[3923.46 → 3930.94] Before I read the text, let me say, if when you got the e-bulletin or when you walked in this morning
[3930.94 → 3936.88] and got the worship paper, and you saw the title of this message being,
[3936.88 → 3938.56] What About Israel?
[3939.88 → 3947.00] And you were immediately concerned because of the geopolitical situations that we find ourselves in.
[3948.00 → 3951.48] Let me say that this isn't that talk.
[3951.48 → 3959.32] This is, I believe, a more important question about identity and theology,
[3960.08 → 3964.86] but I'm also not going to use this platform to engage in geopolitics.
[3965.14 → 3966.48] I don't think that's faithful.
[3967.38 → 3969.38] Now, I have lots of opinions and perspectives,
[3969.60 → 3973.40] and I'm happy to go tête-à-tête with anyone who wants to debate those things.
[3973.74 → 3975.66] We can do that after over coffee.
[3975.66 → 3981.52] So, if that's what you were here to hear, apologies, it's not what you're going to hear.
[3983.20 → 3990.32] What we are going to do is read what God has for us in Romans 11,
[3990.52 → 4000.20] as Paul wrestles with the sovereignty of God and the people of Israel's seeming rejection
[4000.20 → 4002.88] of the message of the gospel.
[4002.88 → 4008.52] And so then let's read together in Romans 11.
[4011.62 → 4013.44] Paul writes, he continues,
[4013.88 → 4017.42] I ask then, did God reject his people?
[4018.58 → 4019.66] By no means.
[4020.58 → 4025.18] I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham from the tribe of Benjamin.
[4026.30 → 4029.28] God did not reject his people whom he foreknew.
[4029.28 → 4033.16] Don't you know what scripture says in the passage about Elijah?
[4033.70 → 4037.12] How he appealed to God against Israel, saying,
[4037.52 → 4040.32] Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars.
[4040.52 → 4043.86] I am the only one left, and they are trying to kill me.
[4044.64 → 4046.02] And what was God's answer to him?
[4047.02 → 4051.56] I have reserved for myself 7,000 who have not bowed the knee to Baal.
[4051.56 → 4056.26] So too, at the present time, there is a remnant chosen by grace.
[4056.96 → 4059.60] And if by grace, then it cannot be based on works.
[4059.88 → 4062.32] If it were, grace would no longer be grace.
[4063.32 → 4064.12] What then?
[4065.32 → 4069.16] What the people of Israel sought so earnestly they did not obtain.
[4069.74 → 4072.46] The elect among them did, but others were hardened.
[4072.46 → 4073.98] As it is written,
[4074.94 → 4077.26] God gave them a spirit of stupor,
[4077.38 → 4080.50] eyes that could not see and ears that could not hear,
[4080.64 → 4081.92] to this very day.
[4083.10 → 4083.88] And David says,
[4084.36 → 4086.80] May their table become a snare and a trap,
[4086.90 → 4089.46] a stumbling block and a retribution for them.
[4089.86 → 4092.54] May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see
[4092.54 → 4095.24] and their backs be bent forever.
[4095.96 → 4097.22] This is the word of the Lord.
[4097.22 → 4097.28] Amen.
[4102.46 → 4106.50] Did God reject his people?
[4108.44 → 4113.66] That's the question that Paul moves to next.
[4115.60 → 4120.30] And it's a question, I think, that actually really makes sense.
[4120.42 → 4123.54] We could anticipate it pretty eagerly and readily,
[4124.20 → 4127.40] given where we've been and what he has said.
[4127.40 → 4131.36] And as we work through it,
[4131.42 → 4135.68] I hope we will also see that it's the same question
[4135.68 → 4141.28] that is on the hearts and minds of so many of us here this morning.
[4142.56 → 4144.64] After every advantage,
[4145.82 → 4149.44] did God reject the people who rejected him?
[4149.44 → 4157.46] So let me give you a super quick three-line summary
[4157.46 → 4160.82] and recap of this section of Romans
[4160.82 → 4162.34] that got us to this point.
[4163.14 → 4164.56] This will be on the screen, I believe.
[4165.68 → 4168.66] Chapter 9, one-sentence summary,
[4168.90 → 4171.96] God chooses who he will save through faith in the gospel.
[4172.92 → 4174.46] Chapter 10, part 1,
[4174.46 → 4177.82] we humans are responsible for our rejection of him
[4177.82 → 4180.02] and our disobedience and obstinance.
[4180.58 → 4181.90] And then chapter 10, part 2,
[4182.38 → 4185.42] we are used by God to preach the gospel
[4185.42 → 4187.86] by which people are saved.
[4189.04 → 4191.04] And so when you stack those things together,
[4191.54 → 4192.74] the question is,
[4193.00 → 4197.90] why doesn't God turn Israel's heart to him?
[4199.10 → 4200.44] Has he abandoned them?
[4201.76 → 4203.08] That's the heart of the question.
[4203.08 → 4204.94] Does God reject his people?
[4204.94 → 4208.92] Given what we have learned about God,
[4209.20 → 4212.22] that he chooses who he will save by the gospel,
[4212.72 → 4215.60] why is it that they don't believe?
[4217.10 → 4218.62] If, as we said before,
[4218.80 → 4220.18] regeneration precedes faith,
[4220.24 → 4222.28] and I think we've seen that pretty convincingly
[4222.28 → 4223.34] in our work together,
[4223.88 → 4227.48] does someone's, or does Israel's,
[4227.48 → 4231.52] current unbelief mean that God has rejected them?
[4231.52 → 4236.84] Does unbelief at this moment mean God's rejection
[4236.84 → 4239.48] for the rest of our moments?
[4240.72 → 4241.84] And if not,
[4242.76 → 4247.76] what might the reason for ongoing hope be?
[4249.74 → 4251.22] I hope you can begin to see it, right?
[4251.24 → 4253.20] When we ask that way,
[4253.42 → 4255.12] we're starting to see
[4255.12 → 4258.72] the kind of existential crisis moment
[4258.72 → 4259.88] that we're entering into
[4259.88 → 4261.72] and we're beginning to anticipate
[4261.72 → 4265.16] the hope that Christian parents have
[4265.16 → 4266.56] on a day like today
[4266.56 → 4270.38] when we baptize an infant like Georgia, right?
[4270.40 → 4271.90] That the promises made today,
[4272.04 → 4275.50] the promises uttered by God to her and to us,
[4275.84 → 4277.72] the promises that we make to him,
[4278.02 → 4279.94] and the promises of parents
[4279.94 → 4283.12] to our heavenly Father, right?
[4283.12 → 4288.22] What might be the reason for our hope?
[4289.56 → 4292.38] That's the question in this text.
[4294.30 → 4296.56] Now, I really do hope you can see
[4296.56 → 4298.42] that I'm not exaggerating this case.
[4299.00 → 4301.52] I'm not trying to make a rhetorical flourish here
[4301.52 → 4304.36] because that's just good communication, right?
[4304.54 → 4306.84] The depths of this question,
[4307.06 → 4308.34] the depths of the anguish,
[4308.62 → 4310.42] and the emotional realities
[4310.42 → 4312.68] that we find ourselves are right here.
[4313.12 → 4317.74] They're this moment, right now,
[4318.88 → 4320.62] with all the advantages
[4320.62 → 4322.86] of having received the promises of God,
[4323.56 → 4326.92] what does it mean when someone rejects him?
[4328.98 → 4329.12] Right?
[4329.54 → 4332.92] Did God reject his people?
[4334.70 → 4336.24] And immediately, right,
[4336.32 → 4338.50] immediately he gives an answer to that question.
[4339.20 → 4339.34] Right?
[4339.38 → 4340.54] Did God reject his people?
[4340.54 → 4342.42] By no means.
[4343.12 → 4345.64] And then, all of chapter 11
[4345.64 → 4348.98] gives us three reasons
[4348.98 → 4351.26] why that's not the case.
[4352.52 → 4353.22] Right?
[4353.30 → 4355.06] And so, here are those reasons.
[4355.18 → 4356.58] It's an overview of chapter 11.
[4357.44 → 4357.72] Right?
[4357.94 → 4361.62] First, we see that Israel's unbelief isn't total.
[4362.02 → 4362.24] Right?
[4362.26 → 4364.68] That there is a remnant who believe
[4364.68 → 4370.26] and the elect will show themselves eventually.
[4370.82 → 4374.22] And then, we can see that Israel's stumbling,
[4374.54 → 4375.36] their rejection,
[4375.82 → 4376.98] was for the purpose,
[4377.40 → 4378.38] for God's purpose,
[4378.48 → 4380.42] of grafting in Gentiles.
[4380.50 → 4382.76] That's the second part of chapter 11.
[4382.76 → 4384.38] And then, chapter 3,
[4384.50 → 4386.32] the third part of chapter 11
[4386.32 → 4388.42] says that there will be a point
[4388.42 → 4390.22] when it is true to say
[4390.22 → 4394.18] that all of Israel is saved by grace through faith.
[4394.74 → 4398.18] And that may happen as a mass revival at some point,
[4398.28 → 4400.08] or what I think is more likely,
[4400.22 → 4402.10] and we'll get into this next week,
[4402.10 → 4405.64] is a slower, more developed
[4405.64 → 4407.62] throughout history kind of thing.
[4409.06 → 4409.94] But we'll get there.
[4411.16 → 4413.66] So, if your Bibles are open,
[4414.12 → 4415.58] and you see chapter 11,
[4415.68 → 4418.38] you see it has this kind of flow to it.
[4418.42 → 4419.38] It has this movement.
[4420.04 → 4420.26] Right?
[4420.30 → 4421.10] In the first section,
[4421.32 → 4422.98] Israel's unbelief isn't total.
[4423.14 → 4424.12] In the second section,
[4424.58 → 4426.50] we learn that Israel's stumbling
[4426.50 → 4427.72] was so that Gentiles,
[4427.88 → 4429.66] that's, I think, all of us here,
[4429.96 → 4431.22] can be grafted in.
[4431.22 → 4432.18] But also,
[4432.42 → 4433.70] that natural branches
[4433.70 → 4436.18] are more easily grafted back in.
[4436.84 → 4437.18] And then,
[4437.28 → 4438.90] in the second part of chapter 11,
[4439.28 → 4441.46] we see that there is a point
[4441.46 → 4443.50] where it will be true to say
[4443.50 → 4447.12] that all Israel is saved by grace through faith.
[4448.20 → 4449.58] Now, I paint that big picture
[4449.58 → 4451.52] because it's important to see
[4451.52 → 4453.26] and anticipate some of your questions,
[4453.40 → 4455.58] but also to say that this morning,
[4455.78 → 4457.28] we are focusing on number one.
[4459.08 → 4459.26] Right?
[4459.26 → 4461.40] Israel's unbelief isn't total.
[4461.58 → 4463.86] We'll look at the next two next week.
[4465.48 → 4468.00] And so, in verses 1 through 10,
[4468.08 → 4468.98] what we read,
[4469.96 → 4472.62] we will see three ways,
[4472.68 → 4474.66] I hope we will see three ways
[4474.66 → 4478.74] that show how Israel's unbelief isn't total,
[4479.08 → 4479.84] and therefore,
[4480.38 → 4482.56] God hasn't rejected His people.
[4482.56 → 4485.28] We'll see that there is a remnant
[4485.28 → 4486.28] who currently believe.
[4486.78 → 4488.60] We will see that grace is still grace
[4488.60 → 4490.38] and faith is the gift of grace.
[4490.90 → 4492.70] And we will see the elect
[4492.70 → 4494.54] will always reveal themselves,
[4494.76 → 4496.64] even if it takes a lifetime.
[4497.50 → 4498.68] And so, let's start with number one.
[4500.14 → 4502.84] One of the ways that we can know
[4502.84 → 4505.38] that God has not rejected His people
[4505.38 → 4508.66] is because there is a remnant
[4508.66 → 4510.70] who believe.
[4512.14 → 4513.90] Now, remember, right,
[4513.98 → 4517.16] the question is,
[4517.60 → 4520.82] did God reject His people, Israel?
[4521.64 → 4523.54] And Paul's immediate response
[4523.54 → 4525.40] is, by no means.
[4525.40 → 4529.04] And then his supporting argument
[4529.04 → 4532.32] is Paul himself.
[4533.70 → 4533.82] Right?
[4533.90 → 4534.64] So, how does he know
[4534.64 → 4536.00] that God hasn't rejected Israel?
[4536.36 → 4537.64] Because, he says,
[4537.78 → 4540.54] I am an Israelite myself.
[4541.38 → 4543.66] The first proof that Paul uses
[4543.66 → 4545.76] of God not rejecting Israel
[4545.76 → 4548.14] is that Paul is an Israelite.
[4548.70 → 4549.82] I am an Israelite,
[4549.90 → 4551.34] myself descendant of Abraham
[4551.34 → 4553.32] from the tribe of Benjamin.
[4553.32 → 4556.06] If God had rejected all of Israel,
[4556.24 → 4557.04] how could it be
[4557.04 → 4558.04] that an Israelite
[4558.04 → 4558.96] has come to be
[4558.96 → 4560.26] his chief missionary
[4560.26 → 4561.52] for the gospel
[4561.52 → 4562.78] to the Gentiles?
[4563.84 → 4563.96] Right?
[4564.04 → 4565.44] Paul is an example
[4565.44 → 4567.50] of God not rejecting
[4567.50 → 4568.64] His people.
[4571.30 → 4571.98] Now,
[4573.04 → 4574.68] an argument of one
[4574.68 → 4576.56] doesn't necessarily make
[4576.56 → 4577.70] an argument for the many.
[4578.88 → 4579.44] And so,
[4579.74 → 4582.44] Paul uses Israel's own history
[4582.44 → 4584.50] as an example.
[4585.84 → 4587.34] So, he recalls the story
[4587.34 → 4588.52] of the prophet Elijah.
[4589.24 → 4590.54] This is a story told
[4590.54 → 4591.50] in 1 Kings.
[4592.22 → 4594.86] In 1 Kings 18 and 19,
[4594.86 → 4596.82] you can read about Elijah
[4596.82 → 4599.12] who ministered in Israel
[4599.12 → 4600.60] during a time
[4600.60 → 4602.44] when King Ahab
[4602.44 → 4604.32] has married Queen Jezebel
[4604.32 → 4605.38] and the people
[4605.38 → 4606.26] have worshipped
[4606.26 → 4608.00] Baals and Ashrams.
[4608.04 → 4610.12] These are Canaanite deities,
[4610.50 → 4611.16] gods,
[4611.50 → 4613.32] from outside
[4613.32 → 4617.98] God's relationship
[4617.98 → 4618.58] to His people,
[4618.68 → 4619.24] from the people
[4619.24 → 4620.40] who lived in the land
[4620.40 → 4621.80] before them coming.
[4622.02 → 4622.88] And at this point,
[4623.22 → 4625.54] there is an incredible amount
[4625.54 → 4627.12] of idolatry
[4627.12 → 4628.10] and syncretism
[4628.10 → 4631.06] of the Israelites' worship.
[4631.18 → 4632.72] And people are worshipping
[4632.72 → 4634.00] Baal.
[4634.12 → 4635.46] In one of the stories,
[4636.40 → 4639.18] Elijah challenges Ahab
[4639.18 → 4639.88] and he says,
[4640.28 → 4642.72] bring 450 prophets of Baal
[4642.72 → 4646.26] and 400 prophets of Ashe rah
[4646.26 → 4648.30] to a mountaintop
[4648.30 → 4649.52] and we will have
[4649.52 → 4650.54] a battle of the gods.
[4652.34 → 4653.36] And then even after
[4653.36 → 4655.10] that incredible display
[4655.10 → 4657.04] where the prophets of Baal
[4657.04 → 4657.82] and Ashe rah
[4657.82 → 4659.22] are unable to make
[4659.22 → 4660.14] their gods move
[4660.14 → 4660.82] and do anything
[4660.82 → 4663.30] and Elijah simply prays
[4663.30 → 4664.50] and fire comes down
[4664.50 → 4664.94] from heaven.
[4665.02 → 4665.74] Even after that
[4665.74 → 4666.72] incredible display,
[4667.20 → 4668.56] Elijah flees
[4668.56 → 4669.94] and he goes
[4669.94 → 4670.80] and he hides
[4670.80 → 4671.72] on a mountain
[4671.72 → 4672.96] and hiding on a mountain
[4672.96 → 4674.26] he cries out to God,
[4674.70 → 4676.86] I am the only one left.
[4678.06 → 4679.30] And God speaks to him.
[4679.88 → 4680.42] God says,
[4681.12 → 4682.88] I have reserved in Israel
[4682.88 → 4683.96] 7,000
[4683.96 → 4686.42] who have not worshipped Baal.
[4686.42 → 4689.66] And Paul takes that story
[4689.66 → 4690.94] from Israel's history
[4690.94 → 4692.88] and he uses that
[4692.88 → 4693.88] as a reminder
[4693.88 → 4695.48] that even though
[4695.48 → 4696.78] it looks like
[4696.78 → 4699.34] all Israel has rejected God,
[4699.56 → 4700.66] there is a remnant
[4700.66 → 4701.44] of people
[4701.44 → 4702.28] who believe.
[4703.46 → 4704.64] Paul is one of them
[4704.64 → 4705.70] and surely
[4705.70 → 4706.60] there are others
[4706.60 → 4707.14] as well.
[4707.84 → 4708.34] And in fact,
[4708.76 → 4710.36] we know that this is true
[4710.36 → 4711.40] because,
[4711.82 → 4712.54] for example,
[4712.54 → 4713.68] all the disciples
[4713.68 → 4714.22] of Jesus
[4714.22 → 4716.38] are Jewish.
[4717.40 → 4717.62] Right?
[4717.68 → 4718.70] They're from Israel.
[4719.40 → 4721.14] All the first Christians
[4721.14 → 4722.14] in Judea
[4722.14 → 4723.60] are Jewish.
[4723.84 → 4725.04] The Jerusalem council
[4725.04 → 4725.98] that takes place
[4725.98 → 4727.06] in Acts 15
[4727.06 → 4728.12] is run
[4728.12 → 4729.52] by Jewish church leaders.
[4729.64 → 4730.72] The head of that council
[4730.72 → 4731.54] is James,
[4731.66 → 4732.62] the brother of Jesus
[4732.62 → 4734.98] who is Jewish.
[4735.76 → 4735.98] Right?
[4736.02 → 4737.56] There is a remnant,
[4738.92 → 4739.90] however small
[4739.90 → 4740.58] in comparison
[4740.58 → 4741.40] it may be,
[4741.80 → 4742.68] who believe.
[4743.62 → 4744.96] Paul's first point
[4744.96 → 4746.90] is that not all Israel
[4746.90 → 4748.26] has rejected God.
[4749.26 → 4750.64] That not all Israel
[4750.64 → 4752.42] has rejected the gospel.
[4752.96 → 4753.38] Therefore,
[4753.72 → 4754.84] Israel's rejection
[4754.84 → 4756.18] isn't total.
[4759.20 → 4759.44] Now,
[4760.24 → 4762.14] but by way of comparison,
[4762.62 → 4763.58] and this comparison
[4763.58 → 4764.92] breaks down eventually,
[4765.08 → 4765.86] I understand that,
[4765.86 → 4768.48] but sometimes
[4768.48 → 4770.40] it can look like
[4770.40 → 4772.16] or it can feel like
[4772.16 → 4773.04] Christianity
[4773.04 → 4774.72] in our society
[4774.72 → 4775.50] and in our culture
[4775.50 → 4776.86] is receding.
[4777.46 → 4778.54] And demographically,
[4778.74 → 4779.94] it absolutely is.
[4782.02 → 4782.74] But,
[4782.94 → 4783.60] it is also
[4783.60 → 4784.30] more likely,
[4784.58 → 4784.94] probable,
[4785.24 → 4786.46] more probable to say,
[4786.58 → 4787.64] more accurate to say
[4787.64 → 4790.22] that a cultural Christianity
[4790.22 → 4791.76] is declining.
[4792.38 → 4792.50] Right?
[4792.58 → 4793.92] That Christendom,
[4794.06 → 4794.82] the reign
[4794.82 → 4796.32] and presumed priority
[4796.32 → 4797.68] of Christian ideas
[4797.68 → 4798.38] and ideals
[4798.38 → 4799.46] in Western society
[4799.46 → 4800.66] is receding.
[4801.34 → 4801.90] But,
[4802.44 → 4802.66] right,
[4802.72 → 4803.44] there's always
[4803.44 → 4805.16] a remnant.
[4806.12 → 4806.50] In fact,
[4807.28 → 4808.52] if you have eyes
[4808.52 → 4809.04] to see
[4809.04 → 4810.12] and are listening
[4810.12 → 4811.14] to those stories,
[4811.50 → 4812.82] what seems really clear
[4812.82 → 4813.54] is that God
[4813.54 → 4814.66] is doing something
[4814.66 → 4815.48] right now
[4815.48 → 4817.10] in His church.
[4819.42 → 4819.64] Right?
[4819.64 → 4821.70] For instance,
[4821.84 → 4822.58] here's an example.
[4822.98 → 4823.52] You may have gotten
[4823.52 → 4826.06] this in your mailboxes
[4826.06 → 4826.72] if you have one
[4826.72 → 4827.20] out there.
[4827.96 → 4829.16] This is from
[4829.16 → 4830.22] Reframe Ministries.
[4830.36 → 4831.30] It's a partner agency
[4831.30 → 4832.60] of the Christian Reformed Church.
[4832.74 → 4834.06] They do media
[4834.06 → 4835.96] and publications.
[4837.00 → 4837.54] If you know
[4837.54 → 4838.46] the Today book,
[4838.94 → 4840.26] that's Reframe Media,
[4840.88 → 4841.44] for instance.
[4841.66 → 4842.34] But they work
[4842.34 → 4843.26] around the world.
[4844.24 → 4845.06] This gentleman
[4845.06 → 4845.88] on the front,
[4847.94 → 4849.08] his name is Trajan.
[4849.20 → 4850.68] He was a Hindu priest
[4850.68 → 4851.86] who has become
[4851.86 → 4852.28] a Christian.
[4852.28 → 4853.28] Christian.
[4853.62 → 4853.72] Right?
[4853.72 → 4853.86] Like,
[4853.88 → 4855.22] God is doing something
[4855.22 → 4856.70] in the world
[4856.70 → 4858.22] even when it seems
[4858.22 → 4859.16] like in places
[4859.16 → 4859.70] Christianity
[4859.70 → 4860.96] is receding.
[4861.16 → 4861.98] But also,
[4863.02 → 4863.30] right,
[4863.46 → 4864.48] again,
[4864.58 → 4865.06] if you have
[4865.06 → 4866.08] the ears to hear,
[4866.16 → 4866.56] if you're plugged
[4866.56 → 4867.26] into these kinds
[4867.26 → 4868.02] of conversations,
[4868.74 → 4870.18] recently there was
[4870.18 → 4871.70] a story that came out
[4871.70 → 4873.36] about Ayaan Hirsi Ali.
[4873.92 → 4875.34] She was a former,
[4875.54 → 4876.06] like,
[4876.46 → 4877.10] militant,
[4877.50 → 4878.32] new atheist
[4878.32 → 4879.54] movement person.
[4879.66 → 4881.24] So she hosted events
[4881.24 → 4881.92] with the likes of
[4881.92 → 4882.66] Richard Dawkins
[4882.66 → 4883.72] and Christopher Hitchens
[4883.72 → 4886.30] and railed against
[4886.30 → 4887.94] religion generally
[4887.94 → 4889.24] and then Islam
[4889.24 → 4889.92] specifically.
[4891.68 → 4893.02] She's become a Christian.
[4893.68 → 4894.68] And that just came out
[4894.68 → 4895.60] in the last couple of weeks.
[4897.00 → 4897.68] So here's someone
[4897.68 → 4898.70] who hosted events
[4898.70 → 4899.60] that was specifically
[4899.60 → 4901.02] designed to speak
[4901.02 → 4902.04] against Christianity
[4902.04 → 4903.14] who's now become
[4903.14 → 4904.04] a believer.
[4904.62 → 4904.76] Like,
[4904.76 → 4905.84] God is clearly
[4905.84 → 4906.82] doing something
[4906.82 → 4908.18] in the midst
[4908.18 → 4908.96] of all of this.
[4909.56 → 4909.64] Right?
[4909.76 → 4911.06] God always
[4911.06 → 4911.94] keeps
[4911.94 → 4913.20] a remnant.
[4914.40 → 4914.74] Now,
[4914.78 → 4915.20] it may come
[4915.20 → 4916.56] from surprising places,
[4917.00 → 4918.86] but it's always there.
[4919.78 → 4920.12] And in fact,
[4920.98 → 4922.12] part of our
[4922.12 → 4924.64] confessional identity
[4924.64 → 4926.38] as Reformed Christians,
[4926.56 → 4926.68] right,
[4926.70 → 4927.34] this is a Christian
[4927.34 → 4928.28] Reformed church,
[4928.82 → 4930.32] speaks to this truth.
[4931.14 → 4931.48] So the
[4931.48 → 4932.46] Belgic Confession
[4932.46 → 4933.22] is a document
[4933.22 → 4933.84] that was written
[4933.84 → 4935.32] in the 16th century
[4935.32 → 4936.58] to help
[4936.58 → 4939.08] the rest of the world
[4939.08 → 4939.94] understand
[4939.94 → 4940.72] what it means
[4940.72 → 4941.62] to be Reformed.
[4942.16 → 4943.44] And in Article 27,
[4944.14 → 4945.36] which is titled
[4945.36 → 4947.04] The Holy Catholic Church,
[4947.08 → 4948.50] it explains this.
[4948.92 → 4949.44] It says,
[4950.24 → 4951.56] The church has existed
[4951.56 → 4952.36] from the beginning
[4952.36 → 4953.28] of the world,
[4954.08 → 4955.54] so in the first parents,
[4955.64 → 4956.28] Adam and Eve,
[4956.28 → 4957.52] and will last
[4957.52 → 4958.58] until the end,
[4959.38 → 4960.00] as appears
[4960.00 → 4960.82] from the fact
[4960.82 → 4961.72] that Christ
[4961.72 → 4963.46] is eternal King
[4963.46 → 4964.88] who cannot be
[4964.88 → 4965.88] without subjects.
[4967.08 → 4968.08] And this holy church
[4968.08 → 4968.88] is preserved
[4968.88 → 4969.50] by God
[4969.50 → 4970.30] against the rage
[4970.30 → 4970.88] of the world,
[4971.24 → 4971.80] even though
[4971.80 → 4972.64] for a time
[4972.64 → 4973.40] it may appear
[4973.40 → 4974.16] very small
[4974.16 → 4975.08] to human eyes
[4975.08 → 4975.74] as though
[4975.74 → 4976.82] it were snuffed out.
[4978.76 → 4978.96] Right,
[4979.00 → 4979.74] you hear there,
[4979.90 → 4980.06] right,
[4980.12 → 4982.04] the promise of God
[4982.04 → 4983.46] has always been
[4983.46 → 4984.52] that the church
[4984.52 → 4985.16] will exist
[4985.16 → 4985.92] from the beginning
[4985.92 → 4987.74] until the very end.
[4989.22 → 4989.44] Right,
[4989.52 → 4990.62] and there are two reasons
[4990.62 → 4990.96] why.
[4991.28 → 4991.62] One,
[4991.88 → 4992.90] Christ is King.
[4994.12 → 4994.60] And a king
[4994.60 → 4995.16] is no king
[4995.16 → 4995.90] without subjects.
[4996.16 → 4997.18] He will always
[4997.18 → 4998.40] have subjects.
[4999.28 → 5000.36] And a king
[5000.36 → 5001.44] who is king
[5001.44 → 5002.74] and has subjects
[5002.74 → 5004.94] will always be such
[5004.94 → 5005.44] because,
[5005.96 → 5007.04] as the confession says,
[5007.22 → 5008.22] it is preserved
[5008.22 → 5009.02] by God.
[5009.08 → 5010.02] The holy church
[5010.02 → 5010.84] is preserved
[5010.84 → 5011.44] by God
[5011.44 → 5012.62] against the rage
[5012.62 → 5014.28] of the world.
[5014.38 → 5015.06] And so no matter
[5015.06 → 5016.54] how small
[5016.54 → 5017.88] it may look
[5017.88 → 5018.64] to us
[5018.64 → 5019.74] here at the moment
[5019.74 → 5020.62] and on the ground,
[5020.62 → 5022.38] there is always
[5022.38 → 5024.56] a remnant.
[5024.68 → 5025.46] There's always
[5025.46 → 5027.38] those who
[5027.38 → 5028.34] truly,
[5029.08 → 5029.54] genuinely
[5029.54 → 5030.64] believe.
[5030.64 → 5035.14] the second point
[5035.14 → 5037.18] that Paul makes
[5037.18 → 5039.08] is to show,
[5039.50 → 5040.42] the point that he makes
[5040.42 → 5040.96] to show
[5040.96 → 5042.30] that Israel's unbelief
[5042.30 → 5043.04] isn't total
[5043.04 → 5044.24] is that grace
[5044.24 → 5045.56] is still grace
[5045.56 → 5046.52] and that faith
[5046.52 → 5047.50] is the gift
[5047.50 → 5048.34] of grace.
[5048.48 → 5048.78] Notice
[5048.78 → 5049.92] he ends
[5049.92 → 5050.90] verse 5.
[5051.88 → 5052.28] He says,
[5052.28 → 5053.98] there is a remnant
[5053.98 → 5056.40] chosen by grace.
[5056.94 → 5057.84] And if by grace
[5057.84 → 5058.72] then it cannot be
[5058.72 → 5059.42] based on works.
[5059.68 → 5060.32] If it were,
[5060.54 → 5061.78] grace would no longer
[5061.78 → 5063.38] be grace.
[5064.90 → 5065.50] But,
[5065.72 → 5066.50] to his point,
[5066.70 → 5068.08] grace is still
[5068.08 → 5069.06] grace.
[5070.26 → 5070.38] Right?
[5070.52 → 5071.40] God's choosing
[5071.40 → 5072.42] is based on
[5072.42 → 5073.60] his mercy,
[5073.78 → 5074.60] his grace,
[5075.12 → 5076.54] God's choosing
[5076.54 → 5077.10] is based on
[5077.10 → 5077.84] his grace,
[5078.00 → 5079.12] not on
[5079.12 → 5080.16] Israel's
[5080.16 → 5080.88] rejection.
[5081.12 → 5081.96] And so hear that,
[5082.04 → 5082.18] right?
[5082.18 → 5083.22] As we layer this
[5083.22 → 5083.58] together,
[5083.86 → 5084.00] right?
[5084.42 → 5085.52] Someone's rejection,
[5085.80 → 5086.74] anyone's rejection,
[5086.92 → 5087.72] Israel's rejection
[5087.72 → 5088.72] or your rejection,
[5089.08 → 5089.74] my rejection,
[5090.16 → 5090.30] right?
[5090.50 → 5091.60] Someone's rejection
[5091.60 → 5093.40] is always
[5093.40 → 5094.34] overcome
[5094.34 → 5095.82] by grace.
[5096.30 → 5097.28] That's what grace
[5097.28 → 5097.76] does.
[5098.86 → 5098.98] Right?
[5099.12 → 5099.50] Grace
[5099.50 → 5101.26] overcomes
[5101.26 → 5102.54] our rejection
[5102.54 → 5103.12] of God.
[5103.22 → 5104.14] In order for us
[5104.14 → 5105.54] to have faith,
[5105.70 → 5106.50] to respond
[5106.50 → 5107.68] to grace,
[5107.74 → 5108.60] we must first
[5108.60 → 5109.88] be regenerated.
[5109.96 → 5110.68] We must be born
[5110.68 → 5111.90] again into newness
[5111.90 → 5112.58] of life.
[5112.58 → 5114.10] Our heart of stone
[5114.10 → 5115.28] must be transformed
[5115.28 → 5116.48] into a heart
[5116.48 → 5117.04] of flesh.
[5117.36 → 5118.34] In order for us
[5118.34 → 5119.20] to be raised
[5119.20 → 5120.76] from spiritual death
[5120.76 → 5122.44] into new life
[5122.44 → 5123.48] with Jesus,
[5123.88 → 5125.18] we must have
[5125.18 → 5126.24] our rejection
[5126.24 → 5126.98] overcome
[5126.98 → 5128.98] by his grace.
[5130.40 → 5131.10] And baptism,
[5131.36 → 5131.68] which we
[5131.68 → 5132.88] participated and
[5132.88 → 5133.62] witnessed this morning,
[5133.90 → 5135.00] is a beautiful
[5135.00 → 5136.36] symbol of this
[5136.36 → 5137.76] very action
[5137.76 → 5138.84] of God.
[5138.84 → 5138.88] God.
[5138.92 → 5139.60] It's a symbol
[5139.60 → 5141.24] of a promised
[5141.24 → 5141.92] fulfillment
[5141.92 → 5142.80] of grace
[5142.80 → 5143.82] offered.
[5145.22 → 5145.90] One of the reasons
[5145.90 → 5146.48] that I find
[5146.48 → 5147.34] infant baptism
[5147.34 → 5148.78] such a compelling
[5148.78 → 5149.84] and beautiful
[5149.84 → 5150.60] symbol
[5150.60 → 5151.36] and an image
[5151.36 → 5152.18] of this promise
[5152.18 → 5153.06] is because
[5153.06 → 5154.12] very clearly,
[5154.66 → 5154.82] right,
[5154.90 → 5156.08] this beautiful baby,
[5156.26 → 5156.62] Georgia,
[5157.04 → 5158.52] as beautiful as she is,
[5158.78 → 5159.36] very clearly,
[5159.52 → 5160.92] she can't do anything
[5160.92 → 5162.18] to choose God.
[5162.18 → 5164.42] In fact,
[5164.46 → 5165.06] she can barely
[5165.06 → 5166.14] do anything
[5166.14 → 5167.52] on her own
[5167.52 → 5168.04] at all,
[5168.72 → 5169.38] let alone
[5169.38 → 5170.94] choose God.
[5175.80 → 5177.02] But the spiritual
[5177.02 → 5178.04] reality we all
[5178.04 → 5178.54] face
[5178.54 → 5180.10] is that none
[5180.10 → 5180.70] of us can,
[5181.96 → 5182.42] that none
[5182.42 → 5183.80] of us do,
[5184.22 → 5185.02] none of us
[5185.02 → 5186.04] apart from
[5186.04 → 5187.34] his grace.
[5187.52 → 5188.14] And that's the
[5188.14 → 5188.86] point, right?
[5189.26 → 5190.32] Israel's rejection
[5190.32 → 5191.20] isn't total
[5191.20 → 5192.30] or isn't final
[5192.30 → 5193.38] because God
[5193.38 → 5193.98] is God.
[5194.66 → 5195.18] And God
[5195.18 → 5195.78] is gracious.
[5196.66 → 5197.44] And God's
[5197.44 → 5197.94] promises
[5197.94 → 5199.04] remain.
[5201.16 → 5201.94] Hear this.
[5202.40 → 5203.30] There is always
[5203.30 → 5204.48] hope because
[5204.48 → 5205.40] there is always
[5205.40 → 5205.86] God.
[5207.16 → 5208.30] There is always
[5208.30 → 5209.12] hope because
[5209.12 → 5210.36] God is always
[5210.36 → 5210.98] there.
[5210.98 → 5216.98] because grace
[5216.98 → 5218.52] is still
[5218.52 → 5219.58] grace.
[5220.38 → 5221.34] Because God
[5221.34 → 5222.78] is God,
[5223.72 → 5224.62] there is
[5224.62 → 5225.58] hope.
[5226.62 → 5227.20] Paul finishes
[5227.20 → 5227.80] this point,
[5227.88 → 5228.22] he says
[5228.22 → 5229.48] in verse 7,
[5230.36 → 5231.00] what the people
[5231.00 → 5231.90] of Israel
[5231.90 → 5232.94] sought so
[5232.94 → 5233.84] earnestly
[5233.84 → 5235.06] they did
[5235.06 → 5235.78] not obtain.
[5236.88 → 5237.94] Which is another
[5237.94 → 5238.76] way of saying,
[5238.90 → 5239.14] right,
[5239.14 → 5239.90] that no matter
[5239.90 → 5240.56] how hard
[5240.56 → 5241.24] you try,
[5241.68 → 5242.36] it's never
[5242.36 → 5242.84] enough.
[5244.46 → 5245.06] It's another
[5245.06 → 5245.94] way of saying,
[5246.28 → 5246.76] no matter how
[5246.76 → 5247.58] much passion
[5247.58 → 5248.38] or commitment
[5248.38 → 5249.30] you show,
[5249.98 → 5250.40] it's never
[5250.40 → 5250.84] enough.
[5252.12 → 5252.54] It's another
[5252.54 → 5252.88] way of saying,
[5252.94 → 5253.42] no matter how
[5253.42 → 5254.62] earnestly you
[5254.62 → 5255.02] seek,
[5255.12 → 5255.84] no matter how
[5255.84 → 5258.32] genuinely hard
[5258.32 → 5259.38] you strive,
[5260.30 → 5260.88] it's not
[5260.88 → 5261.30] enough.
[5262.42 → 5263.42] Your desire,
[5263.86 → 5264.80] your earnest
[5264.80 → 5265.94] efforts,
[5266.46 → 5267.46] cannot do
[5267.46 → 5268.30] what only
[5268.30 → 5269.44] God's grace
[5269.44 → 5270.08] can.
[5271.28 → 5272.24] Every effort
[5272.24 → 5273.00] will fall
[5273.00 → 5273.34] short.
[5275.92 → 5276.90] But hear
[5276.90 → 5277.20] this,
[5278.24 → 5279.04] because that
[5279.04 → 5279.96] also means
[5279.96 → 5282.22] that Israel's
[5282.22 → 5282.92] rejection
[5282.92 → 5284.12] of God
[5284.12 → 5284.80] is not
[5284.80 → 5285.86] necessarily
[5285.86 → 5287.58] equal to
[5287.58 → 5288.36] or connected
[5288.36 → 5289.52] to God's
[5289.52 → 5289.92] rejection
[5289.92 → 5290.72] of Israel
[5290.72 → 5291.32] because
[5291.32 → 5292.76] His grace
[5292.76 → 5294.16] is more.
[5294.16 → 5294.20] more.
[5296.48 → 5296.76] And we'll
[5296.76 → 5297.20] return to
[5297.20 → 5297.68] this idea
[5297.68 → 5298.52] and flesh
[5298.52 → 5298.78] it out
[5298.78 → 5299.24] even more
[5299.24 → 5300.24] next week.
[5301.80 → 5302.82] His grace
[5302.82 → 5304.90] is more.
[5307.48 → 5307.90] And the
[5307.90 → 5309.08] third
[5309.08 → 5310.58] and final
[5310.58 → 5311.00] point
[5311.00 → 5312.50] that Paul
[5312.50 → 5313.24] makes about
[5313.24 → 5313.98] Israel's
[5313.98 → 5314.86] rejection
[5314.86 → 5315.78] not being
[5315.78 → 5316.26] total
[5316.26 → 5317.14] is that
[5317.14 → 5318.58] the elect
[5318.58 → 5320.16] will always
[5320.16 → 5321.06] reveal
[5321.06 → 5321.16] themselves
[5321.16 → 5321.76] themselves
[5321.76 → 5323.08] even
[5323.08 → 5323.74] if it
[5323.74 → 5324.12] takes
[5324.12 → 5324.92] a lifetime.
[5326.80 → 5327.10] Again,
[5327.26 → 5328.08] verse 7
[5328.08 → 5328.46] says,
[5329.54 → 5329.86] the people
[5329.86 → 5330.60] of Israel
[5330.60 → 5333.92] sought
[5333.92 → 5335.12] so earnestly
[5335.12 → 5336.00] what the
[5336.00 → 5336.34] people of
[5336.34 → 5336.56] Israel
[5336.56 → 5336.86] sought
[5336.86 → 5337.52] so earnestly
[5337.52 → 5338.42] they did
[5338.42 → 5339.14] not obtain
[5339.14 → 5339.94] but the
[5339.94 → 5340.54] elect
[5340.54 → 5341.14] among
[5341.14 → 5341.58] them
[5341.58 → 5342.18] did.
[5343.02 → 5343.58] The others
[5343.58 → 5344.02] were hardened.
[5344.76 → 5345.32] The elect
[5345.32 → 5346.24] among
[5346.24 → 5346.64] them
[5346.64 → 5347.18] did.
[5348.32 → 5348.70] If you've
[5348.70 → 5349.06] been in this
[5349.06 → 5349.52] journey with
[5349.52 → 5349.76] us,
[5349.84 → 5350.26] remember
[5350.26 → 5350.90] that chapter
[5350.90 → 5351.68] 9 was all
[5351.68 → 5352.24] about God's
[5352.24 → 5352.56] sovereign
[5352.56 → 5353.34] choice.
[5353.48 → 5354.08] Chapter 9
[5354.08 → 5354.78] is Paul's
[5354.78 → 5355.36] election
[5355.36 → 5356.18] argument.
[5356.56 → 5357.68] God foreknew
[5357.68 → 5360.14] all who
[5360.14 → 5360.58] would be
[5360.58 → 5361.06] saved.
[5361.22 → 5363.08] He foreordained.
[5363.92 → 5365.06] He purposed
[5365.06 → 5365.90] it to
[5365.90 → 5366.32] happen.
[5367.12 → 5367.66] He made
[5367.66 → 5368.04] it is.
[5368.14 → 5368.52] It's more
[5368.52 → 5369.00] than just
[5369.00 → 5369.44] he looked
[5369.44 → 5369.82] into the
[5369.82 → 5370.22] future
[5370.22 → 5371.48] about which
[5371.48 → 5371.80] he was
[5371.80 → 5372.30] unsure
[5372.30 → 5373.10] and saw
[5373.10 → 5373.84] they might
[5373.84 → 5374.24] and they
[5374.24 → 5374.52] might
[5374.52 → 5375.40] and he's
[5375.40 → 5375.66] kind of
[5375.66 → 5376.08] surprised.
[5376.22 → 5376.96] God brings
[5376.96 → 5377.44] that about.
[5377.56 → 5377.90] That's what
[5377.90 → 5378.62] it means.
[5378.62 → 5380.00] It is one
[5380.00 → 5380.88] person I
[5380.88 → 5381.28] read this
[5381.28 → 5381.92] week summarized
[5381.92 → 5382.80] that those
[5382.80 → 5383.46] God has
[5383.46 → 5384.10] foreknown
[5384.10 → 5385.28] can't fail
[5385.28 → 5385.90] to believe.
[5389.48 → 5390.68] It is
[5390.68 → 5392.12] irresistible
[5392.12 → 5393.22] when God
[5393.22 → 5393.64] moves.
[5397.48 → 5398.30] But from
[5398.30 → 5399.00] the perspective
[5399.00 → 5399.72] of right
[5399.72 → 5400.26] now,
[5401.14 → 5402.10] we want
[5402.10 → 5402.66] to see
[5402.66 → 5403.56] it right
[5403.56 → 5403.88] now.
[5403.88 → 5406.56] and that's
[5406.56 → 5407.16] not always
[5407.16 → 5407.50] how it
[5407.50 → 5407.90] works.
[5409.78 → 5410.18] Sometimes
[5410.18 → 5410.94] it takes
[5410.94 → 5412.16] a lifetime.
[5413.96 → 5414.62] But again,
[5414.72 → 5415.12] grace is
[5415.12 → 5415.70] still grace
[5415.70 → 5416.34] and God
[5416.34 → 5416.90] is still
[5416.90 → 5417.84] God.
[5418.96 → 5419.22] And so
[5419.22 → 5420.02] even if
[5420.02 → 5420.68] it takes
[5420.68 → 5422.00] a lifetime,
[5423.22 → 5424.08] God is
[5424.08 → 5424.96] able to
[5424.96 → 5425.90] overcome
[5425.90 → 5427.68] Israel's
[5427.68 → 5428.30] rejection
[5428.30 → 5429.36] or our
[5429.36 → 5430.56] rejection.
[5430.56 → 5430.68] rejection.
[5435.24 → 5436.20] So as we
[5436.20 → 5436.52] pull all
[5436.52 → 5436.68] this
[5436.68 → 5437.10] together,
[5439.26 → 5441.76] let's
[5441.76 → 5442.30] take this
[5442.30 → 5444.18] theological
[5444.18 → 5446.44] truth of
[5446.44 → 5447.32] Israel and
[5447.32 → 5448.18] her relationship
[5448.18 → 5448.80] to God
[5448.80 → 5449.70] and use
[5449.70 → 5451.16] that as
[5451.16 → 5451.94] an analogy
[5451.94 → 5453.86] for our
[5453.86 → 5454.48] relationship
[5454.48 → 5455.10] to God.
[5455.74 → 5456.12] Right?
[5456.16 → 5456.44] Because I
[5456.44 → 5456.80] think that
[5456.80 → 5457.58] Israel's
[5457.58 → 5458.12] rejection
[5458.12 → 5459.34] and God's
[5459.34 → 5459.82] promise
[5459.82 → 5460.96] is a
[5460.96 → 5462.42] good and
[5462.42 → 5462.80] functional
[5462.80 → 5463.56] analogy
[5463.56 → 5464.48] of faith
[5464.48 → 5465.44] for us.
[5466.42 → 5466.86] We've already
[5466.86 → 5467.78] seen part of
[5467.78 → 5468.50] how and why,
[5468.60 → 5468.76] right?
[5468.82 → 5469.14] They had
[5469.14 → 5470.18] every advantage.
[5471.50 → 5472.78] They had
[5472.78 → 5473.90] the prophets
[5473.90 → 5475.10] and they had
[5475.10 → 5476.48] the word of
[5476.48 → 5477.08] God given
[5477.08 → 5477.58] to them.
[5477.70 → 5478.06] They had
[5478.06 → 5478.62] the temple
[5478.62 → 5479.24] to mark
[5479.24 → 5480.10] His presence.
[5480.24 → 5480.54] They had
[5480.54 → 5481.52] every advantage
[5481.52 → 5482.34] of covenant
[5482.34 → 5483.34] belonging.
[5484.82 → 5485.56] And still,
[5485.72 → 5486.12] so many
[5486.12 → 5486.84] seem to
[5486.84 → 5487.24] have
[5487.24 → 5488.10] rejected.
[5488.12 → 5489.60] the same
[5489.60 → 5490.12] is true
[5490.12 → 5490.84] for so
[5490.84 → 5491.16] many
[5491.16 → 5492.54] who you
[5492.54 → 5493.32] know and
[5493.32 → 5493.62] love.
[5495.20 → 5496.12] Maybe even
[5496.12 → 5496.66] as you sit
[5496.66 → 5497.54] here now.
[5498.78 → 5499.38] Right?
[5499.46 → 5500.06] That's more
[5500.06 → 5500.96] your story
[5500.96 → 5502.02] than one
[5502.02 → 5502.66] of deep
[5502.66 → 5503.34] belief
[5503.34 → 5504.42] and hope.
[5506.10 → 5506.96] We all
[5506.96 → 5507.50] know
[5507.50 → 5508.36] people
[5508.36 → 5509.10] that we
[5509.10 → 5509.86] all are
[5509.86 → 5510.86] sitting in
[5510.86 → 5511.28] maybe
[5511.28 → 5512.48] our own
[5512.48 → 5513.10] rejection.
[5515.20 → 5515.72] And we
[5515.72 → 5516.28] want to
[5516.28 → 5517.02] see right
[5517.02 → 5518.10] now that
[5518.10 → 5518.96] rejection
[5518.96 → 5519.62] overcome.
[5521.14 → 5521.82] But the
[5521.82 → 5522.74] hope given
[5522.74 → 5523.42] here,
[5523.56 → 5523.76] right,
[5523.80 → 5524.06] is that
[5524.06 → 5524.74] even if
[5524.74 → 5525.12] it takes
[5525.12 → 5526.00] a lifetime,
[5526.70 → 5527.70] the chosen
[5527.70 → 5528.28] of God
[5528.28 → 5529.30] will reveal
[5529.30 → 5529.80] themselves.
[5532.20 → 5532.94] Now here's
[5532.94 → 5533.26] the hard
[5533.26 → 5533.58] part,
[5533.66 → 5533.86] right?
[5534.54 → 5535.32] Sometimes it
[5535.32 → 5535.78] takes more
[5535.78 → 5536.22] than your
[5536.22 → 5536.84] lifetime
[5536.84 → 5538.16] for the
[5538.16 → 5538.48] chosen
[5538.48 → 5539.56] to reveal
[5539.56 → 5540.04] themselves.
[5541.32 → 5542.02] So maybe
[5542.02 → 5542.50] you don't
[5542.50 → 5543.10] get to see
[5543.10 → 5543.34] it,
[5543.34 → 5543.40] it.
[5545.20 → 5545.86] But you
[5545.86 → 5546.40] still pray
[5546.40 → 5546.68] it.
[5548.92 → 5549.12] Right?
[5549.16 → 5549.50] You still
[5549.50 → 5550.58] plead with
[5550.58 → 5551.26] God and
[5551.26 → 5551.90] with people
[5551.90 → 5552.82] urging them,
[5552.98 → 5553.52] see this
[5553.52 → 5553.94] truth.
[5556.54 → 5557.68] We want to
[5557.68 → 5558.36] see it right
[5558.36 → 5559.08] now and we
[5559.08 → 5560.42] want people to
[5560.42 → 5562.08] look like they
[5562.08 → 5563.16] believe and they
[5563.16 → 5563.60] belong.
[5564.66 → 5565.24] And so we have
[5565.24 → 5566.22] sometimes, I think,
[5566.30 → 5567.16] elevated the
[5567.16 → 5568.00] looking like
[5568.00 → 5569.04] without
[5569.04 → 5571.96] ensuring
[5571.96 → 5573.14] and praying
[5573.14 → 5574.02] and working
[5574.02 → 5574.86] towards
[5574.86 → 5576.58] the reality
[5576.58 → 5577.38] of
[5577.38 → 5578.38] grace
[5578.38 → 5579.24] still being
[5579.24 → 5579.72] grace
[5579.72 → 5580.60] conversion.
[5582.20 → 5582.74] And so we've
[5582.74 → 5583.20] accepted
[5583.20 → 5586.04] something that
[5586.04 → 5587.18] looks like
[5587.18 → 5587.98] Christians
[5587.98 → 5590.18] without calling
[5590.18 → 5590.72] for
[5590.72 → 5593.02] being raised
[5593.02 → 5594.10] out of
[5594.10 → 5594.90] spiritual death
[5594.90 → 5596.02] into new
[5596.02 → 5596.42] life.
[5596.42 → 5597.56] And yet
[5597.56 → 5598.10] again,
[5598.60 → 5599.06] the hope
[5599.06 → 5599.72] of God
[5599.72 → 5600.72] is still
[5600.72 → 5601.40] there because
[5601.40 → 5602.52] God is
[5602.52 → 5603.34] greater than
[5603.34 → 5604.32] our rejection
[5604.32 → 5604.94] in this
[5604.94 → 5605.36] moment.
[5606.30 → 5606.40] Right?
[5606.44 → 5606.80] God is
[5606.80 → 5607.80] stronger than
[5607.80 → 5608.64] my lack
[5608.64 → 5609.14] of faith.
[5610.96 → 5611.84] God is
[5611.84 → 5614.10] more able
[5614.10 → 5616.08] to overcome
[5616.08 → 5617.62] my stubbornness.
[5619.06 → 5620.04] He is
[5620.04 → 5620.78] able to
[5620.78 → 5621.58] overwhelm
[5621.58 → 5622.54] my doubts
[5622.54 → 5623.86] with His
[5623.86 → 5624.28] truth.
[5625.40 → 5625.70] And so
[5625.70 → 5626.20] that's
[5626.20 → 5627.18] what we
[5627.18 → 5627.92] pray.
[5630.36 → 5631.00] If you
[5631.00 → 5631.70] have ears
[5631.70 → 5632.32] to hear
[5632.32 → 5633.34] this morning,
[5633.90 → 5634.50] this is
[5634.50 → 5635.62] exactly what
[5635.62 → 5636.26] we prayed
[5636.26 → 5636.96] and how we
[5636.96 → 5637.66] prayed together
[5637.66 → 5638.24] on Tuesday
[5638.24 → 5638.58] night,
[5638.86 → 5639.42] calling out
[5639.42 → 5639.84] to God
[5639.84 → 5640.38] that our
[5640.38 → 5640.90] sons and
[5640.90 → 5641.30] our daughters
[5641.30 → 5641.60] and our
[5641.60 → 5642.04] brothers and
[5642.04 → 5642.48] our sisters
[5642.48 → 5642.82] and our
[5642.82 → 5643.66] friends and
[5643.66 → 5644.14] our family
[5644.14 → 5644.58] members and
[5644.58 → 5645.28] our co-workers
[5645.28 → 5646.04] would hear
[5646.04 → 5646.68] this truth
[5646.68 → 5647.34] and their
[5647.34 → 5648.16] rejection of
[5648.16 → 5648.54] God would
[5648.54 → 5649.04] be overcome
[5649.04 → 5649.84] by the
[5649.84 → 5650.28] power of
[5650.28 → 5650.54] God's
[5650.54 → 5650.84] grace.
[5651.88 → 5652.30] That's what
[5652.30 → 5652.72] we did
[5652.72 → 5653.30] and that's
[5653.30 → 5653.78] what we do
[5653.78 → 5654.76] and we
[5654.76 → 5655.54] did so
[5655.54 → 5656.20] in the
[5656.20 → 5656.68] sure
[5656.68 → 5657.82] confidence
[5657.82 → 5658.86] of whom
[5658.86 → 5659.42] God is.
[5659.50 → 5659.70] In the
[5659.70 → 5660.56] sure confidence
[5660.56 → 5661.20] that God
[5661.20 → 5662.04] is faithful
[5662.04 → 5663.06] to His
[5663.06 → 5663.80] promise.
[5665.18 → 5665.64] And in the
[5665.64 → 5666.20] hope that
[5666.20 → 5667.36] the elect
[5667.36 → 5668.84] will always
[5668.84 → 5669.70] reveal
[5669.70 → 5670.44] themselves.
[5670.88 → 5671.60] In our
[5671.60 → 5672.04] prayers
[5672.04 → 5672.64] together,
[5673.40 → 5673.78] in our
[5673.78 → 5674.54] life together,
[5674.86 → 5675.24] in our
[5675.24 → 5675.60] preaching
[5675.60 → 5677.20] here every
[5677.20 → 5677.86] week,
[5677.86 → 5679.70] we challenge
[5679.70 → 5681.38] the rejection
[5681.38 → 5682.06] of the
[5682.06 → 5682.48] gospel.
[5683.48 → 5684.30] We will
[5684.30 → 5684.76] not sit
[5684.76 → 5685.44] idle by
[5685.44 → 5686.62] as that
[5686.62 → 5687.86] happens in
[5687.86 → 5688.60] our lives
[5688.60 → 5688.86] and the
[5688.86 → 5689.32] lives of
[5689.32 → 5690.18] people we
[5690.18 → 5690.50] love.
[5691.18 → 5691.68] And as we
[5691.68 → 5692.44] challenge the
[5692.44 → 5693.70] rejection of
[5693.70 → 5694.26] the gospel,
[5694.46 → 5695.16] we will do
[5695.16 → 5696.40] so in
[5696.40 → 5697.16] the hope
[5697.16 → 5698.84] that God
[5698.84 → 5700.04] is God
[5700.04 → 5701.24] and that
[5701.24 → 5702.54] He is
[5702.54 → 5703.56] gracious.
[5704.26 → 5704.54] Amen?
[5704.54 → 5704.64] Amen?
[5705.52 → 5706.24] Let's pray
[5706.24 → 5706.58] together.
[5706.58 → 5713.68] Holy God,
[5714.06 → 5714.42] Heavenly
[5714.42 → 5715.38] Father,
[5716.54 → 5720.22] Your ways
[5720.22 → 5722.20] are ultimately
[5722.20 → 5723.48] unfathomable
[5723.48 → 5724.54] to us.
[5725.52 → 5726.64] We are
[5726.64 → 5727.64] unable to
[5727.64 → 5728.48] see the
[5728.48 → 5729.88] minutia of
[5729.88 → 5730.64] You're working
[5730.64 → 5731.28] in this
[5731.28 → 5731.66] world.
[5732.66 → 5733.58] But help
[5733.58 → 5734.34] us, we
[5734.34 → 5735.02] pray today,
[5735.16 → 5735.98] to trust
[5735.98 → 5736.88] that You
[5736.88 → 5737.36] are.
[5739.22 → 5740.16] Help us
[5740.16 → 5740.66] in our
[5740.66 → 5741.58] faith today
[5741.58 → 5743.02] to rest
[5743.02 → 5743.66] in the
[5743.66 → 5744.58] assurance that
[5744.58 → 5745.46] You are
[5745.46 → 5746.30] God and
[5746.30 → 5747.20] You alone.
[5750.34 → 5750.86] And that
[5750.86 → 5751.54] even if
[5751.54 → 5752.56] for a
[5752.56 → 5752.98] moment
[5752.98 → 5753.82] rejection
[5753.82 → 5754.60] seems
[5754.60 → 5755.18] total,
[5755.54 → 5756.58] You are
[5756.58 → 5757.94] greater than
[5757.94 → 5759.08] our rejection.
[5759.64 → 5760.06] That Your
[5760.06 → 5761.64] grace is
[5761.64 → 5762.44] able to
[5762.44 → 5763.02] overcome
[5763.02 → 5764.40] even the
[5764.40 → 5764.78] most
[5764.78 → 5766.30] disobedient
[5766.30 → 5766.74] and
[5766.74 → 5767.58] obstinate
[5767.58 → 5768.60] people.
