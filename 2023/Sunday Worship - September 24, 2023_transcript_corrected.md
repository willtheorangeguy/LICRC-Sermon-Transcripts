[2219.74 → 2249.72] Thank you.
[2249.74 → 2256.74] Good morning.

[2526.74 → 2528.74] Thank you.
[2556.74 → 2558.74] Thank you.
[2586.74 → 2616.74] I would love to,
[2616.74 → 2646.74] here,
[2646.74 → 2648.74] we're here in the sanctuary, you know, I'm going to say, you know, I'm going to say, you know,
[2648.74 → 2650.74] you, I'm going to go with it, but I'll do, so I happen to the Lord, I'm going to hear this, God any of the Lord this is 후, you know, I'm going to do one day, the covenant right, you know, IВотtey, You know the Lord be with you.
[2650.74 → 2656.86] live as you call us to in this world. We pray this in your son's name. Amen. Okay, we're going to do
[2656.86 → 2661.90] the children's blessing. Are you ready? So let's stand up. The congregation's going to, too. Look
[2661.90 → 2665.70] at them all. They know the drill, right? All right, and we'll put our hands up, and we're going to say
[2665.70 → 2670.84] the Lord be with you together. Nice and loud, okay? Really loud this time. Here we go. One, two, three.
[2670.84 → 2676.64] The Lord be with you. And also with you. All right, you guys can go to children's worship time.
[2680.74 → 2702.04] Good morning. My name is Dave. I am one of the elders for this congregation. Let's join
[2702.04 → 2710.26] together in our church family prayer. Father, this is the day that you have made. We rejoice,
[2710.74 → 2715.48] and we are glad at it. Father, we thank you for the opportunity to meet as your church
[2715.48 → 2720.68] and the church universal to celebrate the body of believers and to celebrate your name.
[2721.92 → 2727.20] Father, we praise you for your creation and the place where we live. We think about the summer
[2727.20 → 2732.94] that we just enjoyed, an opportunity to travel, to enjoy the outdoors, and to spend time with family.
[2733.64 → 2740.72] We thank you for fall, for the change of seasons, and another opportunity to enjoy the world around
[2740.72 → 2749.08] us. And we really take meaning from the words that God saw all that he had made, and it was very good.
[2750.64 → 2755.34] Father, it's important for us to have a time of confession where we think about the sins that we've
[2755.34 → 2760.30] committed against each other. And when we sin against each other, we are also sinning against you.
[2761.04 → 2766.88] We confess there are things that we have done and things that we have not done. We confess that there
[2766.88 → 2773.92] are things that we have said and things that we have not said that have been our failing. Father, we confess
[2773.92 → 2782.76] that we all have our idols, an idol being anything that we put before you. We confess that there are
[2782.76 → 2791.28] times when we put work and career, possessions, status, nation, politics, ideology, and our own sacred
[2791.28 → 2802.32] cows, that we place them all before you. Help us to put those aside so that we can serve you and so that we can serve others.
[2803.20 → 2814.62] Father, this is a good time for us to give thanks. We give thanks for a new school year, an opportunity for our students to learn more about the creation, about their world,
[2814.62 → 2823.04] to learn more about their country, community, their own lives, and their relationship with you.
[2824.18 → 2829.52] Father, we thank you for the leadership in this church. We think about Pastor Chris and Kevin and Josh.
[2829.74 → 2835.10] We ask that you help them to faithfully share your word with us so that we may grow in our faith with you.
[2835.10 → 2843.10] We think about our council, the elders and deacons, those who have the responsibilities for governance, pastoral care, and benevolence.
[2843.48 → 2847.88] We pray for wisdom for them as they make their decisions and serve this church community.
[2848.30 → 2853.98] We think about the many ministries that this church supports and the volunteers who make those happen.
[2854.46 → 2857.88] We think about missions, our local needs and charities.
[2857.88 → 2866.74] We think about those who volunteer for nursery, children's worship time, gems, cadets, the youth, the young adults, care groups, and seniors,
[2866.94 → 2869.78] and all the ministries that we know are important.
[2870.32 → 2875.40] We pray that all of them will serve our community and bring us closer to you.
[2876.04 → 2883.20] We ask that you will move those who can serve to volunteer for any of these important ministries.
[2884.30 → 2886.98] Father, we also pray for the needs that we have.
[2886.98 → 2889.78] We pray for the needs that we have both here and around the world.
[2890.26 → 2896.40] We think about the serious earthquake in Morocco, and we think about the terrible flooding that took place in Libya.
[2896.86 → 2901.18] For both of those occasions, we grieve the loss of life.
[2901.52 → 2904.84] We pray that you'll be very close to those who are grieving and mourning.
[2905.44 → 2909.72] And for all the damage and number of people who have been displaced from their homes,
[2909.72 → 2913.90] we pray that national and international efforts will fall into place,
[2914.00 → 2917.08] that they'll be able to provide the relief to those who need it.
[2917.64 → 2921.04] We think about political uncertainty in Niger and Gabon,
[2921.42 → 2924.66] where they're wondering what kind of leadership their countries will have.
[2925.00 → 2926.88] We pray for wisdom for those in charge,
[2927.28 → 2930.46] and that they'll be able, whether they acknowledge you or not,
[2930.94 → 2934.40] that they will take seriously the message to act justly,
[2934.40 → 2937.26] to love mercy and to walk humbly with their God.
[2937.86 → 2940.70] We think about the ongoing war in Ukraine.
[2942.24 → 2945.16] And aside from all the politics and geopolitics of it,
[2945.32 → 2949.64] we remember that it's the innocents caught in the middle who are going to suffer.
[2950.04 → 2953.26] We pray that this war can come to an end,
[2953.50 → 2956.84] and a real meaningful peace can be achieved between those two countries.
[2956.84 → 2959.72] Father, we think about our offering today,
[2960.20 → 2965.40] where we give our funds to the seeds of hope,
[2965.78 → 2968.48] where we think about those who have been affected by HMV and AIDS.
[2968.80 → 2972.86] We thank you for that ministry and the difference that we can make in those lives.
[2973.44 → 2977.26] We think about the needs of those in our own congregation and their family members.
[2977.84 → 2980.32] We pray for Thelma Tastemaker,
[2980.84 → 2985.34] Amanda's mom who is in palliative care and facing the end of life.
[2985.34 → 2989.26] We pray that you'll give her the peace and comfort that she needs.
[2991.60 → 2997.16] And we pray for God's presence for all those who know her and who love her.
[2997.64 → 2999.96] We thank you, Lord, that Ellen White is at home.
[3000.52 → 3004.42] We ask that you'll help us to provide the support and the love that she needs
[3004.42 → 3005.88] as she faces her health needs.
[3006.30 → 3008.74] We think about Rose Vita with her health concerns.
[3008.74 → 3015.74] We do pray for healing and better quality of life with that.
[3016.08 → 3020.74] Father, we think about Amy Iron, a former member of this church who is dealing with cancer
[3020.74 → 3023.48] and in the midst of chemotherapy.
[3024.24 → 3027.48] We thank you for the treatment that she is able to give.
[3027.48 → 3032.54] We pray that we'll ultimately be successful, and she could be restored to full health before too long.
[3032.86 → 3038.28] We think about those in our midst and those that we know who are broken and hurting.
[3038.74 → 3041.72] We ask that you be with them in their current situation.
[3042.50 → 3045.52] And Father, we pray for Chris as he leads us in your word.
[3045.90 → 3051.72] We pray that we'll seriously respond to our mission to gather, grow, and go.
[3051.72 → 3059.52] Father, Father, we pray all these things not because we deserve it,
[3059.70 → 3063.14] but we pray it in the name of Jesus who loved us and died for us.
[3063.90 → 3064.14] Amen.
[3081.72 → 3093.80] I don't know about you, but this morning before worship,
[3093.98 → 3096.86] I had five or six different conversations with different people,
[3097.46 → 3106.58] and every one of them was around the idea of just how busy life is right now,
[3107.58 → 3110.46] just how hectic things can feel.
[3110.46 → 3113.14] And so as we come to God's word,
[3113.32 → 3118.00] I just want to take a minute and allow you to take a deep breath,
[3119.00 → 3123.40] to hold it, and to exhale slowly,
[3124.22 → 3128.26] and to still your heart,
[3129.66 → 3134.64] to still your mind as we enter into the presence of God,
[3134.64 → 3140.42] as we hear the Father speak his word of hope and love over us,
[3140.54 → 3146.00] and as he fills us with his purpose and power,
[3146.00 → 3154.96] in a culture that idolizes busyness,
[3154.96 → 3158.06] slowing down,
[3158.06 → 3160.36] stopping,
[3161.80 → 3164.48] sunbathing in the presence of God,
[3164.96 → 3166.72] and hearing his voice,
[3167.52 → 3170.90] is not only counter-cultural,
[3171.72 → 3177.26] it's not only a witness that we offer to the world of a sense of peace
[3177.26 → 3180.68] that surpasses the chaos of life,
[3181.12 → 3186.38] but is a chance for you to just rest.
[3186.38 → 3193.02] And so rest in the presence and words of Jesus this morning.
[3194.06 → 3197.70] We're going to read together from Deuteronomy 4.
[3198.46 → 3201.12] We're going to read just a few verses,
[3201.32 → 3202.86] verses 5 through 8.
[3202.86 → 3207.38] As we have prayed and said already,
[3207.62 → 3209.44] at the beginning of the ministry year,
[3209.84 → 3217.50] we focus in and launch out of a reflection on our mission or purpose together,
[3217.66 → 3219.72] to gather, grow, and go.
[3220.98 → 3226.42] Last week, we focused in and looked at our shared life together.
[3227.08 → 3231.80] This week, we will focus in and look at how our shared life
[3231.80 → 3235.08] leads to a shared witness.
[3236.02 → 3240.82] And we'll see that starting in Deuteronomy 4, 5 through 8.
[3240.90 → 3242.56] And so let's read together.
[3246.56 → 3253.28] See, I taught you decrees and laws as the Lord my God commanded me.
[3254.44 → 3259.78] What you need to know is that Moses is standing in front of the people of Israel.
[3259.78 → 3264.08] They have exiled out of Egypt.
[3264.28 → 3267.02] They have wandered through the wilderness,
[3267.30 → 3270.20] came to Sinai, received the Ten Commandments,
[3270.38 → 3273.54] disobeyed God, and spent 40 years wandering
[3273.54 → 3275.56] before they could enter the Promised Land.
[3275.70 → 3282.20] And Deuteronomy is a second telling of God's word to them
[3282.20 → 3284.80] before they enter the land.
[3285.14 → 3289.04] In many ways, this is Moses' final message to the people.
[3289.04 → 3291.98] Hear what the Lord has said for you,
[3292.48 → 3295.22] that you may live well in the land he has promised.
[3296.58 → 3301.16] See, I have taught you decrees and laws as the Lord my God commanded me,
[3301.54 → 3304.56] so that you may follow them in the land you are entering,
[3304.78 → 3306.12] to take possession of it.
[3307.06 → 3308.42] Observe them carefully,
[3308.90 → 3312.50] for this will show your wisdom and understanding to the nations,
[3312.50 → 3315.86] who will hear about all these decrees and say,
[3315.94 → 3320.52] surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.
[3321.32 → 3324.68] What other nation is so great as to have their gods near them
[3324.68 → 3328.44] the way the Lord our God is near us whenever we pray to him?
[3328.44 → 3333.72] And what other nation is so great as to have such righteous decrees and laws
[3333.72 → 3338.18] as this body of laws I am setting before you today?
[3339.18 → 3340.76] This is the word of the Lord.
[3340.76 → 3351.12] Now, as a church, we gather here every week,
[3351.62 → 3356.14] and we gather together in the little places throughout the week.
[3356.68 → 3359.60] We gather together to worship God.
[3359.70 → 3363.28] We gather together to celebrate his work in our lives.
[3363.40 → 3368.04] We gather together as the fellowship of the Holy Spirit in our midst.
[3368.04 → 3372.84] We gather together as brothers and sisters in Christ,
[3372.94 → 3376.34] made so by the blood of Jesus.
[3377.92 → 3383.04] And whether we gather around this table here in this fellowship
[3383.04 → 3387.64] or around tables in your homes or tables in your offices
[3387.64 → 3389.50] or wherever it is that you might be,
[3389.60 → 3395.58] however we gather, we do so to grow in the grace and knowledge
[3395.58 → 3397.02] of our Lord and Saviour Jesus.
[3397.02 → 3403.46] We do so in order to be grown and to bear fruit as we abide in Jesus.
[3404.58 → 3407.16] And then, together, we go.
[3408.24 → 3412.16] As Jesus sent the disciples, so he is sending us.
[3412.28 → 3416.56] The church is the called-out, sent people of God.
[3416.68 → 3421.12] We gather and grow in order to scatter and go.
[3421.12 → 3424.90] Worship in the Word and through prayer.
[3425.10 → 3431.96] Worship in spirit and in truth is used by God to fuel us for mission,
[3432.20 → 3435.48] to fuel us as his scent people.
[3437.08 → 3439.86] Last week, we looked at our shared life.
[3440.08 → 3443.74] This week, we look at our shared witness.
[3443.74 → 3452.76] Now, as part of this launch season that we are in the midst of,
[3453.76 → 3462.30] this last Thursday, we hosted the first ministry and mission table here,
[3462.30 → 3467.94] which is a gathering of all the leaders and coordinators and team captains and committee chairs.
[3467.94 → 3473.02] The goal at that gathering is to sort of celebrate what God is doing
[3473.02 → 3479.42] and to help equip leaders as they face challenges in our ministry and mission together,
[3479.42 → 3483.52] as they face what it is that we're doing here in our midst,
[3483.58 → 3486.26] as they're encouraged by God to do that work.
[3486.26 → 3490.06] And one of the things that we talked about that evening,
[3490.38 → 3491.60] I'm not going to recap at all,
[3491.86 → 3495.22] is just how amazing all you all are.
[3497.36 → 3500.26] Did you know that in this church,
[3500.78 → 3505.46] we have over 330 volunteer positions?
[3506.24 → 3507.88] That's places to serve.
[3509.02 → 3511.64] Now, that doesn't include things like night shift
[3511.64 → 3516.08] or the mission thrift store or the food bank, right?
[3516.08 → 3518.38] That's just sort of internal stuff.
[3518.38 → 3520.32] And that doesn't include reactivate,
[3521.08 → 3524.00] which would add 150 opportunities.
[3525.36 → 3528.94] We have 330 opportunities to serve here.
[3529.22 → 3532.96] And I'm sure that I've missed a few because some people work so well
[3532.96 → 3538.12] and serve so quietly in their places that it goes unnoticed.
[3539.54 → 3542.78] Did you know that we also have approximately,
[3543.50 → 3544.56] for the same reasons,
[3544.56 → 3550.32] approximately 144 members volunteering in these positions?
[3551.60 → 3554.76] And that's not including the youth helpers
[3554.76 → 3556.04] that we have in the different places.
[3558.04 → 3559.76] And so for those of you doing the quick math,
[3559.86 → 3563.96] that's approximately 60% of our members are active,
[3564.08 → 3564.76] are volunteering,
[3564.96 → 3567.00] and are serving in our church community.
[3567.58 → 3568.82] And this is amazing.
[3568.82 → 3574.54] Like, what you need to hear is how much higher that number is
[3574.54 → 3579.32] than the average sort of institutional realities.
[3580.40 → 3580.90] Right?
[3580.98 → 3584.30] Sometimes you talk about the 80-20 split, right,
[3584.34 → 3587.06] where 80% of the work is done by 20% of the people.
[3588.02 → 3590.46] Now, I admit that our top 20% of volunteers
[3590.46 → 3592.54] are incredibly high-functioning people.
[3592.54 → 3596.94] But with 60% of you guys active in the life of this church,
[3597.04 → 3598.60] that's something worth celebrating.
[3598.60 → 3604.06] Also, the kinds of volunteers we have here are amazing.
[3604.20 → 3605.78] Again, for those of you who are doing the math,
[3606.40 → 3611.22] on average, our volunteers are doing 2.29 volunteer positions.
[3612.44 → 3613.90] So that means you're working hard.
[3614.84 → 3615.78] And that's awesome.
[3616.98 → 3617.10] Right?
[3617.16 → 3621.68] This working together is part of our shared witness,
[3622.36 → 3623.60] part of our shared reality.
[3623.60 → 3627.28] And to be honest, I think most of us get it.
[3628.56 → 3628.68] Right?
[3628.78 → 3630.56] God is calling us to serve,
[3630.78 → 3632.08] and you all are responding.
[3633.92 → 3635.54] Now, what this also means,
[3636.02 → 3639.10] remember, 330 to 144,
[3639.50 → 3640.38] what this also means,
[3640.46 → 3642.24] if you are a guest here,
[3642.30 → 3644.48] or if you are looking for a place to plug in,
[3645.14 → 3646.54] there's lots of room for you.
[3647.44 → 3648.84] There's lots of opportunity.
[3649.80 → 3649.94] Right?
[3649.96 → 3651.42] If God's been laying on your heart
[3651.42 → 3653.82] a way to participate in the life of this church,
[3653.96 → 3657.20] to add to our shared witness together,
[3657.80 → 3659.40] there's a chance for you to do that,
[3659.42 → 3660.90] and there are lots of places to connect.
[3661.02 → 3662.28] And following worship,
[3662.74 → 3664.58] you'll see many of those places,
[3664.70 → 3666.94] and you'll have opportunity to sign up
[3666.94 → 3668.50] for those places to connect.
[3668.50 → 3674.78] What I want us to see together this morning
[3674.78 → 3678.98] comes from the theological,
[3679.54 → 3682.00] the biblical underpinnings,
[3682.66 → 3684.70] foundations that call us
[3684.70 → 3688.10] to this kind of life together.
[3689.46 → 3690.26] And so for just a moment,
[3690.42 → 3692.90] I want to do some biblical theology with you
[3692.90 → 3695.08] to ground us in this.
[3695.08 → 3697.44] And so for those of you
[3697.44 → 3699.54] who are less interested in this work,
[3699.98 → 3701.86] just bear with me for a few minutes
[3701.86 → 3704.28] because it will help ground us
[3704.28 → 3706.48] and I think give us a firmer foundation
[3706.48 → 3707.78] for what we do.
[3708.48 → 3710.00] But here to start
[3710.00 → 3712.08] is a theological principle
[3712.08 → 3714.16] that applies not just to this morning
[3714.16 → 3714.80] and to our life,
[3714.88 → 3716.48] but to your study of the Bible.
[3717.76 → 3717.96] Right?
[3718.00 → 3719.78] So if you study the Bible on your own
[3719.78 → 3720.58] or in small group,
[3720.80 → 3721.78] remember this principle
[3721.78 → 3723.34] and it will help make sense
[3723.34 → 3725.06] of what you read and hear.
[3726.00 → 3726.96] Here's the principle.
[3729.06 → 3731.64] What was promised to Israel
[3731.64 → 3734.72] is fulfilled in Jesus
[3734.72 → 3738.30] and is now applied to the church.
[3740.20 → 3740.50] Okay?
[3740.68 → 3741.42] Let me say that again.
[3741.52 → 3744.32] What was promised to Israel
[3744.32 → 3746.62] is fulfilled in Jesus
[3746.62 → 3749.20] and is now applied to the church.
[3749.20 → 3751.52] Let me give you an example
[3751.52 → 3752.60] of what I'm talking about here.
[3752.74 → 3753.50] Again, we're doing the work
[3753.50 → 3754.38] of biblical theology.
[3755.50 → 3757.52] Hosea 11 verse 1.
[3758.42 → 3760.54] One of the so-called minor prophets,
[3760.70 → 3761.98] not because he was less important,
[3762.08 → 3764.22] but because he wrote smaller books.
[3765.16 → 3766.36] Hosea says,
[3766.62 → 3768.30] when Israel was a child,
[3768.40 → 3769.84] or God says through Hosea,
[3770.34 → 3770.88] Hosea,
[3770.96 → 3772.18] when Israel was a child,
[3772.30 → 3773.16] I loved him
[3773.16 → 3774.50] and out of Egypt
[3774.50 → 3776.16] I called my son.
[3777.50 → 3777.76] Right?
[3777.76 → 3779.04] The prophet is saying
[3779.04 → 3781.38] that God has called Israel
[3781.38 → 3782.56] out of Egypt.
[3783.64 → 3783.98] Right?
[3784.02 → 3785.04] We've already grounded ourselves
[3785.04 → 3785.86] in that story.
[3786.88 → 3788.00] They were taken away.
[3788.94 → 3790.12] They fled there
[3790.12 → 3790.96] because of a famine.
[3791.10 → 3792.38] They became slaves in Egypt
[3792.38 → 3794.08] and then they were exodus.
[3795.04 → 3797.16] They were carried out by God.
[3798.88 → 3799.44] Then,
[3799.44 → 3804.40] if you jump to Matthew 2
[3804.40 → 3806.50] verse 13 and 15,
[3806.68 → 3807.32] and you can just write
[3807.32 → 3808.68] Hosea 11 verse 1,
[3808.78 → 3810.34] Matthew 2, 13 and 15 down.
[3810.44 → 3811.16] You can see it later.
[3812.12 → 3812.88] Matthew writes,
[3813.06 → 3814.50] when they had gone,
[3814.66 → 3815.64] an angel of the Lord
[3815.64 → 3816.74] appeared to Joseph
[3816.74 → 3817.64] in a dream.
[3818.28 → 3819.00] The angel said,
[3819.06 → 3819.48] get up,
[3819.62 → 3820.58] take the child
[3820.58 → 3821.34] and his mother
[3821.34 → 3822.54] and escape to Egypt.
[3823.04 → 3823.96] Stay there
[3823.96 → 3825.30] until I tell you
[3825.30 → 3826.42] for Herod is going
[3826.42 → 3827.58] to search for the child
[3827.58 → 3828.46] and to kill him.
[3828.92 → 3829.32] So,
[3829.58 → 3830.64] Joseph got up,
[3830.86 → 3831.56] took the child
[3831.56 → 3832.24] and his mother
[3832.24 → 3833.00] during the night
[3833.00 → 3834.48] and left for Egypt
[3834.48 → 3835.54] where he stayed
[3835.54 → 3837.08] until the death of Herod.
[3837.32 → 3838.56] And then hear what Matthew writes,
[3838.98 → 3840.70] and so was fulfilled
[3840.70 → 3841.62] what the Lord
[3841.62 → 3842.26] had said
[3842.26 → 3843.02] through the prophet,
[3843.74 → 3844.80] out of Egypt
[3844.80 → 3846.14] I have called
[3846.14 → 3847.28] my son.
[3848.60 → 3849.66] What was promised
[3849.66 → 3850.58] to Israel
[3850.58 → 3851.84] is fulfilled
[3851.84 → 3853.08] in Jesus
[3853.08 → 3854.38] and now is applied
[3854.38 → 3855.56] to the church.
[3855.76 → 3855.82] So,
[3855.96 → 3856.12] let's,
[3856.58 → 3857.46] Hosea 11,
[3857.68 → 3858.54] Matthew 2,
[3858.68 → 3860.30] now Romans 6.
[3860.48 → 3862.14] Romans 6 verse 6 to 9.
[3863.14 → 3864.80] For if we have been united
[3864.80 → 3865.46] with him
[3865.46 → 3867.02] in a death like his,
[3867.08 → 3867.82] we will certainly
[3867.82 → 3869.02] also be united
[3869.02 → 3869.60] with him
[3869.60 → 3870.44] in a resurrection
[3870.44 → 3871.42] like his.
[3871.74 → 3872.66] For we know
[3872.66 → 3873.82] that our old self
[3873.82 → 3875.34] was crucified with him
[3875.34 → 3876.22] so that the body
[3876.22 → 3877.54] ruled by sin
[3877.54 → 3878.64] might be done away with
[3878.64 → 3879.84] that we should no longer
[3879.84 → 3882.82] be slaves to sin.
[3883.76 → 3884.50] Because anyone
[3884.50 → 3885.32] who has died
[3885.32 → 3886.52] has been set free
[3886.52 → 3887.32] from sin.
[3887.74 → 3887.94] Now,
[3888.00 → 3889.16] if we died with Christ,
[3889.22 → 3889.66] we believe
[3889.66 → 3890.30] that we will also
[3890.30 → 3891.26] live with him
[3891.26 → 3892.34] for we know
[3892.34 → 3893.28] that since Christ
[3893.28 → 3894.46] was raised from the dead,
[3894.56 → 3896.24] he cannot die again.
[3896.52 → 3897.70] Death no longer
[3897.70 → 3898.96] has mastery
[3898.96 → 3900.48] over them.
[3901.86 → 3902.38] So,
[3902.38 → 3904.14] Israel was a slave
[3904.14 → 3905.70] in Egypt
[3905.70 → 3906.74] and they were
[3906.74 → 3908.40] promised freedom
[3908.40 → 3909.54] from slavery.
[3909.78 → 3910.72] Jesus came,
[3911.06 → 3912.00] took on the nature
[3912.00 → 3913.16] of a slave
[3913.16 → 3914.52] and became
[3914.52 → 3917.12] obedient unto death
[3917.12 → 3918.26] and has now
[3918.26 → 3920.06] set us free
[3920.06 → 3921.76] from being slaves
[3921.76 → 3922.96] to sin.
[3923.90 → 3924.72] What was promised
[3924.72 → 3925.30] to Israel
[3925.30 → 3926.36] is fulfilled in Jesus
[3926.36 → 3927.32] and is now applied
[3927.32 → 3928.72] to the life
[3928.72 → 3929.32] of the church.
[3929.32 → 3931.28] you can see this again
[3931.28 → 3932.78] in Genesis 12,
[3932.98 → 3933.14] right?
[3933.18 → 3933.72] The promise
[3933.72 → 3935.02] of God spoken
[3935.02 → 3936.00] to Abraham.
[3936.40 → 3937.14] It's the founding,
[3937.46 → 3938.48] the first patriarch
[3938.48 → 3939.26] of the nation
[3939.26 → 3940.02] of Israel.
[3940.16 → 3940.72] God says,
[3941.56 → 3942.38] I will make you
[3942.38 → 3943.70] into a great nation
[3943.70 → 3944.90] and I will bless you
[3944.90 → 3945.72] and I will make your name
[3945.72 → 3947.08] great, and you will be
[3947.08 → 3947.84] a blessing.
[3949.14 → 3949.96] And then,
[3950.06 → 3951.18] in Matthew 4,
[3951.90 → 3952.72] in the story
[3952.72 → 3953.34] where Jesus
[3953.34 → 3954.48] goes into the wilderness
[3954.48 → 3955.22] to be tempted
[3955.22 → 3956.48] by the devil,
[3956.48 → 3957.56] there's an attempt
[3957.56 → 3959.46] to circumvent
[3959.46 → 3960.26] or shortcut
[3960.26 → 3961.48] this promise.
[3961.64 → 3962.70] The devil says,
[3962.82 → 3963.96] the devil took Jesus
[3963.96 → 3965.20] to a very high mountain
[3965.20 → 3965.92] and showed him
[3965.92 → 3966.58] all the kingdoms
[3966.58 → 3967.18] of the world
[3967.18 → 3968.04] and their splendour
[3968.04 → 3968.76] and said,
[3969.12 → 3970.50] all this I will give you
[3970.50 → 3971.68] if you bow down
[3971.68 → 3972.58] and worship me.
[3973.34 → 3974.20] And Jesus said,
[3974.26 → 3974.94] away from me,
[3974.98 → 3975.16] Satan,
[3975.26 → 3975.84] for it is written,
[3976.06 → 3977.20] worship the Lord your God
[3977.20 → 3978.94] and serve him only.
[3979.76 → 3980.84] The devil is tempting
[3980.84 → 3982.16] Jesus with a shortcut
[3982.16 → 3983.46] to the fulfillment
[3983.46 → 3984.20] of the promise
[3984.20 → 3985.54] spoken to Israel,
[3985.54 → 3986.14] but instead,
[3986.66 → 3988.02] as we read in Philippians 2
[3988.02 → 3989.34] and I've already alluded to it,
[3990.20 → 3990.90] Philippians 2,
[3991.12 → 3992.08] and being found
[3992.08 → 3993.46] in appearance as a man,
[3993.86 → 3995.72] Jesus humbled himself
[3995.72 → 3997.50] becoming obedient to death,
[3997.64 → 3999.18] even death on the cross.
[3999.70 → 4000.22] Therefore,
[4000.68 → 4001.80] God exalted him
[4001.80 → 4002.92] to the highest place
[4002.92 → 4004.14] and gave him the name
[4004.14 → 4005.34] that is above every name
[4005.34 → 4006.80] that at the name of Jesus
[4006.80 → 4008.10] every knee should bow
[4008.10 → 4009.42] in heaven and on earth
[4009.42 → 4010.54] and under the earth
[4010.54 → 4012.58] and every tongue acknowledge
[4012.58 → 4014.84] that Jesus Christ is Lord
[4014.84 → 4016.68] to the glory of God,
[4017.00 → 4017.50] the Father.
[4019.42 → 4021.60] What was promised to Israel
[4021.60 → 4024.58] is fulfilled in Jesus
[4024.58 → 4027.36] and then applied to the church.
[4027.88 → 4030.24] In Revelation 3, verse 12,
[4030.38 → 4030.76] we read,
[4030.76 → 4035.28] I will write the name of my God,
[4035.38 → 4036.64] the name of my city,
[4036.72 → 4037.46] of my God,
[4037.54 → 4038.96] the new Jerusalem on them,
[4039.02 → 4040.14] which is coming down
[4040.14 → 4041.46] out of heaven from my God,
[4041.58 → 4043.90] and I will also write on them
[4043.90 → 4045.54] my new name.
[4046.54 → 4047.32] And after this,
[4047.38 → 4047.74] I looked,
[4047.80 → 4048.62] and there before me
[4048.62 → 4049.54] was a great multitude
[4049.54 → 4050.66] that no one can count
[4050.66 → 4051.54] from every nation,
[4051.96 → 4052.28] tribe,
[4052.34 → 4052.76] and people,
[4052.84 → 4053.50] and language
[4053.50 → 4055.28] standing before the throne
[4055.28 → 4056.20] and before the Lamb,
[4056.20 → 4057.30] and they were wearing
[4057.30 → 4058.16] white robes
[4058.16 → 4058.84] and were holding
[4058.84 → 4059.70] palm branches
[4059.70 → 4061.00] in their hands.
[4062.26 → 4063.22] What was promised
[4063.22 → 4064.26] to Israel
[4064.26 → 4065.52] is fulfilled in Jesus
[4065.52 → 4067.08] and applied to the church.
[4067.60 → 4068.54] And you can do this
[4068.54 → 4069.82] all throughout the Bible.
[4069.88 → 4070.18] You can do it
[4070.18 → 4071.42] with the temple, right?
[4071.48 → 4072.52] The Garden of Eden
[4072.52 → 4073.36] was a temple.
[4073.52 → 4073.96] The people
[4073.96 → 4075.10] had a tabernacle
[4075.10 → 4075.80] and a temple
[4075.80 → 4076.76] where God dwelt
[4076.76 → 4077.46] among them.
[4077.78 → 4079.00] And then Jesus says,
[4079.12 → 4080.26] destroy this temple
[4080.26 → 4081.76] and I will rebuild it.
[4082.34 → 4083.12] John tells us
[4083.12 → 4084.16] that Jesus was referring
[4084.16 → 4084.82] to the temple
[4084.82 → 4085.86] of His body
[4085.86 → 4086.58] because Jesus
[4086.58 → 4087.80] is the place
[4087.80 → 4088.90] where God dwells
[4088.90 → 4089.70] with His people.
[4090.20 → 4091.24] John 1, 14,
[4091.36 → 4092.46] the Word became flesh
[4092.46 → 4093.34] and made His dwelling
[4093.34 → 4094.12] among us.
[4094.96 → 4096.46] And then Paul writes,
[4097.36 → 4098.44] do you not know
[4098.44 → 4099.94] that your bodies
[4099.94 → 4101.56] are a temple
[4101.56 → 4102.90] of the Holy Spirit
[4102.90 → 4104.26] who is in you,
[4104.56 → 4105.38] whom you have received
[4105.38 → 4106.00] from God?
[4106.26 → 4107.94] You are not your own.
[4109.22 → 4109.94] You see it
[4109.94 → 4111.08] over and over again.
[4111.18 → 4111.80] What is promised
[4111.80 → 4112.44] to Israel
[4112.44 → 4113.16] is fulfilled
[4113.16 → 4113.98] in Jesus
[4113.98 → 4114.58] and is now
[4114.58 → 4115.56] applied to the church.
[4115.66 → 4117.10] And if you take
[4117.10 → 4117.96] this principle,
[4118.22 → 4119.14] this principle
[4119.14 → 4120.08] for interpretation,
[4121.00 → 4122.40] you will get
[4122.40 → 4123.42] so much more
[4123.42 → 4125.06] out of your Bible study
[4125.06 → 4126.14] and so much more
[4126.14 → 4127.60] out of the questions
[4127.60 → 4128.24] you have
[4128.24 → 4129.18] for certain texts
[4129.18 → 4129.92] and how they might
[4129.92 → 4131.50] apply to your life.
[4132.34 → 4133.48] What was promised
[4133.48 → 4134.48] to Israel
[4134.48 → 4135.20] is fulfilled
[4135.20 → 4135.82] in Jesus
[4135.82 → 4136.88] and now applied
[4136.88 → 4138.20] to the church.
[4138.62 → 4139.16] And so,
[4139.30 → 4140.04] of course,
[4140.60 → 4142.04] the same is true
[4142.04 → 4144.42] for Deuteronomy 4
[4144.42 → 4146.14] verses 5 through 8
[4146.14 → 4147.36] for the text
[4147.36 → 4147.98] that we read
[4147.98 → 4149.28] this morning.
[4150.32 → 4151.38] The idea here
[4151.38 → 4152.54] is that the people's
[4152.54 → 4153.06] obedience,
[4153.56 → 4155.20] their beautiful life
[4155.20 → 4155.76] together,
[4155.76 → 4157.90] is supposed to reveal
[4157.90 → 4158.82] God's presence
[4158.82 → 4159.60] among them.
[4159.78 → 4160.92] It's supposed to be
[4160.92 → 4161.56] magnetic
[4161.56 → 4163.10] in order to draw
[4163.10 → 4163.94] other nations
[4163.94 → 4164.62] to God.
[4164.62 → 4164.66] God.
[4166.30 → 4167.86] And in the same way,
[4168.12 → 4169.18] Jesus' obedience,
[4169.46 → 4170.72] His perfect life,
[4170.90 → 4171.72] reveals God's
[4171.72 → 4172.86] perfect righteousness.
[4173.14 → 4173.72] And there's something
[4173.72 → 4175.40] beautiful and compelling
[4175.40 → 4177.02] about Jesus' obedience
[4177.02 → 4178.24] as you read the Gospels.
[4178.50 → 4178.98] There's something
[4178.98 → 4180.28] magnetic about Him
[4180.28 → 4182.12] that draws people
[4182.12 → 4183.14] to Himself,
[4183.56 → 4184.10] which is,
[4184.20 → 4184.58] of course,
[4184.66 → 4185.24] we believe,
[4185.32 → 4186.94] a drawing to God.
[4188.18 → 4189.06] And then the same
[4189.06 → 4190.86] is true for us,
[4190.98 → 4191.70] for the church,
[4191.90 → 4193.36] not only globally
[4193.36 → 4194.24] and historically,
[4194.40 → 4196.50] but here at Langley-Emmanuel,
[4196.64 → 4198.04] right in our midst,
[4198.14 → 4199.18] our obedience,
[4199.42 → 4201.62] our shared life together,
[4202.24 → 4203.70] hopefully beautiful,
[4204.96 → 4205.62] but beauty
[4205.62 → 4208.02] and scars together,
[4208.86 → 4210.66] reveals the presence
[4210.66 → 4212.62] of God among us.
[4213.06 → 4214.94] It reveals His kingdom come
[4214.94 → 4216.16] and His kingdom coming
[4216.16 → 4217.46] in our hearts
[4217.46 → 4218.42] and in our lives.
[4218.90 → 4220.36] And there's something,
[4220.64 → 4221.20] Lord willing,
[4221.44 → 4222.36] there's something
[4222.36 → 4224.02] magnetic about that
[4224.02 → 4225.86] that draws other people
[4225.86 → 4227.36] to encounter God,
[4227.46 → 4228.48] to encounter Jesus,
[4229.14 → 4230.82] to encounter God
[4230.82 → 4232.30] at work in the world
[4232.30 → 4234.50] through us,
[4235.20 → 4235.80] His church.
[4237.40 → 4237.76] And again,
[4237.84 → 4238.40] look carefully
[4238.40 → 4240.04] at what Moses says
[4240.04 → 4240.76] to the people
[4240.76 → 4241.64] in our text.
[4241.64 → 4242.38] He says,
[4243.38 → 4244.64] observe them carefully,
[4244.76 → 4245.60] that is the commands
[4245.60 → 4246.12] and the laws
[4246.12 → 4247.52] that I have given you.
[4247.96 → 4249.00] Observe them carefully,
[4249.20 → 4250.24] for this will show
[4250.24 → 4251.02] your wisdom
[4251.02 → 4251.78] and understanding
[4251.78 → 4252.46] to the nations
[4252.46 → 4253.78] who will hear about
[4253.78 → 4254.62] all these decrees
[4254.62 → 4255.16] and say,
[4255.40 → 4257.98] surely this is a great nation
[4257.98 → 4258.84] or this great nation
[4258.84 → 4259.48] is wise
[4259.48 → 4261.08] and understanding people.
[4263.08 → 4265.24] By her contrast,
[4266.84 → 4269.34] by her life
[4269.34 → 4270.90] standing apart
[4270.90 → 4272.28] from the other nations,
[4272.96 → 4274.26] Israel is supposed
[4274.26 → 4276.42] to lead by example
[4276.42 → 4279.60] and in so doing
[4279.60 → 4281.44] draw others
[4281.44 → 4282.72] to the truth
[4282.72 → 4283.74] of who God is
[4283.74 → 4284.40] and His plan
[4284.40 → 4285.18] and purpose
[4285.18 → 4286.06] for how to live
[4286.06 → 4286.52] in the world.
[4287.82 → 4288.12] And so,
[4288.24 → 4288.70] for example,
[4289.50 → 4291.36] in a time of history
[4291.36 → 4292.42] and a part
[4292.42 → 4294.96] of the history
[4294.96 → 4295.96] of civilization
[4295.96 → 4298.02] where child sacrifice
[4298.02 → 4299.14] is common,
[4300.38 → 4302.08] Israel is commanded
[4302.08 → 4303.50] in Leviticus 18,
[4304.28 → 4305.12] do not give
[4305.12 → 4306.28] any of your children
[4306.28 → 4307.40] to be sacrificed
[4307.40 → 4308.28] to Moloch
[4308.28 → 4309.48] for you must not
[4309.48 → 4310.40] profane the name
[4310.40 → 4311.06] of your God.
[4311.44 → 4312.52] I am the Lord.
[4313.52 → 4313.88] Now,
[4313.94 → 4314.74] notice carefully,
[4315.12 → 4315.26] right,
[4315.30 → 4315.94] that there is
[4315.94 → 4317.10] a straight line
[4317.10 → 4318.50] between protecting
[4318.50 → 4319.18] children
[4319.18 → 4320.48] and honouring
[4320.48 → 4321.40] the name of God.
[4322.96 → 4323.18] Right,
[4323.24 → 4324.36] God has a special
[4324.36 → 4325.56] place in His heart
[4325.56 → 4326.56] for children.
[4327.68 → 4328.24] And Jesus
[4328.24 → 4329.52] says the same thing.
[4329.62 → 4330.32] Jesus says
[4330.32 → 4331.22] in Matthew 19,
[4331.22 → 4332.90] let the little children
[4332.90 → 4333.72] come to me
[4333.72 → 4335.18] and do not hinder them
[4335.18 → 4335.76] for the kingdom
[4335.76 → 4336.70] of heaven belongs
[4336.70 → 4338.00] to such as these.
[4338.08 → 4338.92] Or in Matthew 18,
[4339.02 → 4339.44] He says,
[4340.00 → 4341.36] rather explicitly,
[4341.78 → 4343.06] if anyone causes
[4343.06 → 4344.46] one of these little ones,
[4344.60 → 4345.40] those who believe
[4345.40 → 4345.80] in me,
[4345.92 → 4346.56] to stumble,
[4347.04 → 4347.80] it would be better
[4347.80 → 4348.56] for them to have
[4348.56 → 4349.60] a large millstone
[4349.60 → 4350.56] hung around their neck
[4350.56 → 4351.76] and to be drowned
[4351.76 → 4352.76] in the depths
[4352.76 → 4353.60] of the sea.
[4357.18 → 4358.10] It was promised
[4358.10 → 4358.62] to Israel,
[4359.02 → 4359.76] it was fulfilled
[4359.76 → 4360.26] in Jesus
[4360.26 → 4361.28] and applies
[4361.28 → 4361.84] to the church.
[4362.16 → 4362.44] Peter,
[4362.64 → 4364.20] in his Acts 2 sermon
[4364.20 → 4365.48] on the day of Pentecost,
[4365.58 → 4365.92] says,
[4366.98 → 4367.54] in Acts 2,
[4367.58 → 4368.14] verse 39,
[4368.30 → 4369.44] the promise is for you
[4369.44 → 4370.96] and for your children,
[4371.14 → 4372.62] for all who are far off,
[4372.64 → 4373.42] for all whom
[4373.42 → 4374.46] the Lord our God
[4374.46 → 4375.26] will call.
[4376.34 → 4376.62] Now,
[4376.66 → 4377.48] this truth,
[4377.62 → 4377.88] right,
[4377.96 → 4379.68] that God is passionate
[4379.68 → 4381.12] for children
[4381.12 → 4382.42] is part of why
[4382.42 → 4383.42] the Christian church
[4383.42 → 4384.46] through millennia
[4384.46 → 4386.10] has baptized infants.
[4386.10 → 4389.12] but also,
[4389.98 → 4390.26] right,
[4390.32 → 4391.76] in this same time frame,
[4392.16 → 4393.92] in the early church
[4393.92 → 4395.92] during the Roman period,
[4396.04 → 4397.54] the Roman Empire period,
[4397.78 → 4399.70] there's a cultural practice
[4399.70 → 4401.38] of infanticide
[4401.38 → 4402.92] or of infant exposure.
[4403.98 → 4404.44] That is,
[4404.54 → 4405.46] in Roman culture,
[4405.60 → 4406.68] it was very common
[4406.68 → 4408.88] for unwanted children,
[4409.24 → 4409.90] and honestly,
[4410.06 → 4411.08] usually it was girls,
[4411.94 → 4412.18] right,
[4412.20 → 4413.14] who were born to people
[4413.14 → 4413.94] that didn't want them
[4413.94 → 4415.18] to be taken outside
[4415.18 → 4416.08] the city walls
[4416.08 → 4416.98] and to be left
[4416.98 → 4417.76] on a garbage heap
[4417.76 → 4419.80] and then just walked away.
[4420.92 → 4422.48] This act of infant exposure
[4422.48 → 4423.46] is common,
[4423.78 → 4424.56] it is accepted,
[4424.78 → 4425.72] and it is normalized
[4425.72 → 4427.22] in the Roman world.
[4428.48 → 4429.90] In the early church,
[4430.46 → 4431.94] the Christians refused
[4431.94 → 4433.40] to let that stand,
[4434.24 → 4436.02] refused to let that happen.
[4436.80 → 4436.96] Now,
[4436.98 → 4437.60] sometimes,
[4437.88 → 4438.82] slavers would go
[4438.82 → 4439.82] to those garbage heaps
[4439.82 → 4441.34] and they would take the kids
[4441.34 → 4442.86] and then they would raise
[4442.86 → 4443.92] those kids as slaves
[4443.92 → 4445.64] usually in some form
[4445.64 → 4446.18] of trafficking.
[4447.64 → 4448.58] But also,
[4448.92 → 4450.24] early Christian families
[4450.24 → 4450.98] would go out
[4450.98 → 4451.76] to these places
[4451.76 → 4452.78] and they would collect
[4452.78 → 4453.32] these children
[4453.32 → 4454.38] and they would raise them
[4454.38 → 4455.48] as their own.
[4456.00 → 4457.04] And there are so many
[4457.04 → 4458.16] amazing stories
[4458.16 → 4459.32] from the early church
[4459.32 → 4460.80] of these children
[4460.80 → 4461.94] who were gathered
[4461.94 → 4463.46] from the exposure piles
[4463.46 → 4464.52] who grow up
[4464.52 → 4465.42] and become leaders.
[4465.96 → 4466.88] One becomes a bishop
[4466.88 → 4468.20] in the early church.
[4470.14 → 4471.96] The church even started
[4471.96 → 4473.14] writing letters
[4473.14 → 4474.00] to the emperor
[4474.00 → 4476.12] to stop the practice.
[4478.34 → 4478.82] Now,
[4478.86 → 4479.64] let me be clear
[4479.64 → 4480.64] that this work
[4480.64 → 4481.88] continues today,
[4482.00 → 4482.28] right,
[4482.34 → 4483.56] as children
[4483.56 → 4484.84] are being sacrificed
[4484.84 → 4485.68] to all sorts
[4485.68 → 4486.62] of different mole
[4486.62 → 4487.38] in the world
[4487.38 → 4488.22] that we live in.
[4489.28 → 4490.74] The work of pro-life,
[4490.88 → 4492.26] of protecting children
[4492.26 → 4493.24] in trafficking,
[4493.68 → 4495.46] the work of protecting
[4495.46 → 4497.26] the least
[4497.26 → 4498.30] and the smallest
[4498.30 → 4499.04] among us
[4499.04 → 4500.48] continues as part
[4500.48 → 4501.72] of our shared
[4501.72 → 4503.48] responsibility together.
[4504.62 → 4505.14] But again,
[4505.20 → 4506.12] we can keep going here
[4506.12 → 4506.88] because you trace
[4506.88 → 4508.24] the same for laws
[4508.24 → 4508.92] in Israel
[4508.92 → 4509.90] around refugees
[4509.90 → 4511.00] or strangers
[4511.00 → 4511.82] or aliens,
[4512.38 → 4512.50] right?
[4512.52 → 4513.16] You can even make
[4513.16 → 4513.98] the case for the
[4513.98 → 4514.96] dietary laws
[4514.96 → 4515.58] that were given
[4515.58 → 4516.52] to the people
[4516.52 → 4517.38] as a reflection
[4517.38 → 4518.48] of some sort of wisdom
[4518.48 → 4519.56] to protect them
[4519.56 → 4521.10] from certain diseases.
[4522.88 → 4524.10] This is the point
[4524.10 → 4525.28] that is going on
[4525.28 → 4525.90] and it continues
[4525.90 → 4526.36] for Moses
[4526.36 → 4527.06] in our text
[4527.06 → 4528.44] where he says,
[4529.16 → 4530.12] what other nation
[4530.12 → 4531.04] is so great
[4531.04 → 4532.28] as to have their gods
[4532.28 → 4533.18] near them
[4533.18 → 4534.52] the way the Lord
[4534.52 → 4535.34] our God
[4535.34 → 4536.24] is near us
[4536.24 → 4537.82] when we pray to Him?
[4538.86 → 4539.30] Again,
[4539.40 → 4539.80] remember
[4539.80 → 4541.24] the principle here,
[4541.32 → 4541.50] right,
[4541.56 → 4542.88] that their beautiful
[4542.88 → 4543.78] life together
[4543.78 → 4545.40] is supposed to reveal
[4545.40 → 4546.26] God's presence
[4546.26 → 4546.84] among them,
[4546.90 → 4548.16] supposed to be magnetic
[4548.16 → 4549.22] in order to draw
[4549.22 → 4550.16] the other nations
[4550.16 → 4551.22] to God.
[4552.80 → 4553.92] And God's presence
[4553.92 → 4556.10] is especially clear
[4556.10 → 4557.34] when He answers
[4557.34 → 4558.10] their prayers.
[4559.54 → 4560.60] Exodus 6,
[4560.78 → 4561.42] verse 5,
[4561.84 → 4562.38] God says,
[4562.50 → 4563.14] I have heard
[4563.14 → 4563.82] the groaning
[4563.82 → 4564.78] of the Israelites
[4564.78 → 4566.04] whom the Egyptians
[4566.04 → 4566.94] are enslaving
[4566.94 → 4568.06] and I have remembered
[4568.06 → 4569.24] my covenant.
[4570.00 → 4571.10] Isaiah 38,
[4571.20 → 4571.78] verse 5,
[4571.90 → 4572.96] I have heard
[4572.96 → 4573.74] your prayers
[4573.74 → 4574.72] and seen
[4574.72 → 4576.48] your tears.
[4580.12 → 4581.02] I don't know
[4581.02 → 4582.58] where every one of you
[4582.58 → 4583.40] is at right now,
[4583.40 → 4585.76] but I am confident
[4585.76 → 4587.02] that we all need
[4587.02 → 4588.36] to know a God
[4588.36 → 4589.68] who hears our prayers
[4589.68 → 4592.38] and sees our tears.
[4593.72 → 4595.84] That's who this God is.
[4596.00 → 4596.10] He,
[4596.42 → 4597.48] in Proverbs 15,
[4597.54 → 4597.88] 29,
[4598.08 → 4599.18] hears the prayer
[4599.18 → 4600.58] of the righteous.
[4601.12 → 4602.16] Or James 5,
[4602.22 → 4602.96] into the New Testament
[4602.96 → 4603.50] community,
[4603.86 → 4604.44] James 5,
[4604.50 → 4604.92] 15,
[4605.02 → 4605.38] promises,
[4605.56 → 4606.30] the prayer offered
[4606.30 → 4606.78] in faith
[4606.78 → 4607.90] will make the sick
[4607.90 → 4608.58] person well
[4608.58 → 4609.26] and the Lord
[4609.26 → 4611.44] will raise them up.
[4613.04 → 4613.42] Now,
[4613.48 → 4614.14] I will be the first
[4614.14 → 4614.90] to say that sometimes
[4614.90 → 4615.48] our prayers
[4615.48 → 4616.44] don't get answered
[4616.44 → 4616.96] in the way
[4616.96 → 4617.70] that we think
[4617.70 → 4618.70] they should be.
[4619.64 → 4620.02] And sometimes
[4620.02 → 4621.02] we pray for healing
[4621.02 → 4621.54] and healing
[4621.54 → 4622.28] doesn't come
[4622.28 → 4622.80] in the way
[4622.80 → 4624.40] that we expect it to.
[4626.30 → 4627.96] But it is still true
[4627.96 → 4629.24] that when healing
[4629.24 → 4630.02] does come
[4630.02 → 4630.72] and the saints
[4630.72 → 4631.46] have prayed,
[4631.66 → 4632.26] it's because
[4632.26 → 4633.16] the saints have prayed.
[4634.22 → 4635.12] That when healing
[4635.12 → 4635.94] does come
[4635.94 → 4636.72] and the elders
[4636.72 → 4637.36] have been called
[4637.36 → 4638.02] and the person's
[4638.02 → 4638.46] been anointed
[4638.46 → 4639.02] with oil
[4639.02 → 4639.80] and prayed over
[4639.80 → 4641.26] like we're commanded to,
[4641.46 → 4642.26] that it comes
[4642.26 → 4642.98] because the elders
[4642.98 → 4643.62] have been called
[4643.62 → 4644.30] and the person
[4644.30 → 4644.90] has been anointed
[4644.90 → 4645.78] with oil.
[4649.50 → 4652.26] Our shared witness
[4652.26 → 4655.38] is magnified
[4655.38 → 4657.16] when we,
[4657.74 → 4658.82] on our knees,
[4659.04 → 4660.62] cry out to the Lord
[4660.62 → 4664.44] and then see Him work
[4664.44 → 4666.78] and then declare
[4666.78 → 4667.72] to the world
[4667.72 → 4668.66] that we have seen
[4668.66 → 4669.66] Him work
[4669.66 → 4670.68] when we proclaim
[4670.68 → 4671.72] with boldness
[4671.72 → 4673.06] that God has heard
[4673.06 → 4673.92] and answered
[4673.92 → 4675.66] the cries of my heart.
[4677.50 → 4678.60] But also,
[4678.86 → 4680.32] our witness to the world
[4680.32 → 4681.72] is exemplified,
[4682.14 → 4684.16] is made magnetic
[4684.16 → 4685.24] and compelling
[4685.24 → 4687.14] when we offer up
[4687.14 → 4688.68] these cries of our heart
[4688.68 → 4689.78] and instead of getting
[4689.78 → 4690.74] the answer we want,
[4690.88 → 4692.68] God changes our heart
[4692.68 → 4695.20] to give us the answer
[4695.20 → 4697.82] of His heart.
[4701.06 → 4703.24] Shared life together
[4703.24 → 4706.32] is our shared witness
[4706.32 → 4707.42] to the world.
[4708.12 → 4709.74] You have stories
[4709.74 → 4711.04] of God at work.
[4711.78 → 4712.58] You do
[4712.58 → 4713.52] because I have the privilege
[4713.52 → 4714.92] to hear many of them.
[4715.92 → 4717.56] But that's our witness.
[4717.70 → 4718.94] That's your witness.
[4718.94 → 4722.16] Mark Glanville
[4722.16 → 4724.66] in his book
[4724.66 → 4725.64] Improvising Church,
[4725.76 → 4726.30] he says,
[4726.66 → 4729.22] by their beautiful life,
[4729.58 → 4730.44] ancient Israel
[4730.44 → 4732.04] was supposed to be magnetic
[4732.04 → 4734.06] and the nations would come
[4734.06 → 4736.50] to Yahweh their God.
[4738.50 → 4739.66] We gather,
[4739.98 → 4740.24] grow,
[4740.40 → 4741.20] and go
[4741.20 → 4741.98] here
[4741.98 → 4743.38] and out there
[4743.38 → 4745.58] in order that
[4745.58 → 4747.76] our witness
[4747.76 → 4749.74] might be used of God
[4749.74 → 4751.14] to reveal Him
[4751.14 → 4752.58] to the world,
[4752.64 → 4753.58] might be used of God
[4753.58 → 4754.78] to draw others
[4754.78 → 4756.04] to Him.
[4756.12 → 4758.20] And that can only happen
[4758.20 → 4761.38] if you are going
[4761.38 → 4762.24] to places
[4762.24 → 4765.88] where the acknowledgement
[4765.88 → 4766.50] of God
[4766.50 → 4768.10] is not happening.
[4769.50 → 4770.74] If you are going
[4770.74 → 4771.40] to places
[4771.40 → 4771.68] places
[4771.68 → 4773.80] where God
[4773.80 → 4774.76] has been pushed
[4774.76 → 4775.42] out of
[4775.42 → 4776.30] the conversation.
[4779.04 → 4779.74] That's how
[4779.74 → 4780.50] our shared life
[4780.50 → 4780.98] turns into
[4780.98 → 4781.62] shared witness
[4781.62 → 4782.46] because we are
[4782.46 → 4783.94] in these places.
[4785.94 → 4786.46] Again,
[4786.74 → 4787.68] Mark writes,
[4788.50 → 4788.82] he says,
[4788.90 → 4789.48] let's not pray
[4789.48 → 4790.62] for a large church,
[4791.54 → 4792.30] let's pray
[4792.30 → 4793.52] for a faithful church,
[4794.24 → 4795.42] whether large
[4795.42 → 4795.96] or small.
[4796.96 → 4797.42] He says,
[4797.50 → 4797.84] let's pray
[4797.84 → 4798.42] for a church
[4798.42 → 4799.02] that displays
[4799.02 → 4799.66] the tenderness
[4799.66 → 4800.22] of Christ
[4800.22 → 4801.02] in the neighbourhood
[4801.02 → 4801.64] you love,
[4801.72 → 4802.50] wherever that happens
[4802.50 → 4802.92] to be.
[4803.64 → 4804.90] Beautiful lives
[4804.90 → 4806.92] raising curiosity,
[4807.32 → 4808.38] stirring questions
[4808.38 → 4809.34] about what
[4809.34 → 4810.56] is behind it all.
[4813.08 → 4813.68] This
[4813.68 → 4815.20] is the task
[4815.20 → 4816.62] of the church.
[4817.12 → 4817.74] What was promised
[4817.74 → 4818.30] to Israel
[4818.30 → 4818.92] and fulfilled
[4818.92 → 4819.36] in Jesus
[4819.36 → 4820.32] is now applied
[4820.32 → 4821.92] to us.
[4823.12 → 4824.12] And it has always
[4824.12 → 4824.70] been so,
[4824.76 → 4825.38] and it has always
[4825.38 → 4826.68] been compelling.
[4826.88 → 4827.54] This is part
[4827.54 → 4828.20] of what it means
[4828.20 → 4829.00] when Jesus says
[4829.00 → 4829.52] that we are
[4829.52 → 4830.32] to be salt
[4830.32 → 4831.26] and light
[4831.26 → 4832.14] in the world.
[4833.82 → 4834.56] Last week,
[4834.62 → 4835.24] I made reference
[4835.24 → 4837.24] to a letter
[4837.24 → 4837.80] that was written
[4837.80 → 4838.96] in the second century,
[4839.62 → 4841.44] the epistle
[4841.44 → 4843.00] to Igneous.
[4843.46 → 4844.46] In that letter,
[4844.62 → 4845.52] we read,
[4846.38 → 4847.54] to sum it all up
[4847.54 → 4848.46] in one word,
[4848.96 → 4849.76] what the soul
[4849.76 → 4850.92] is to the body,
[4851.44 → 4852.34] Christians are
[4852.34 → 4853.42] in the world.
[4853.42 → 4853.48] world.
[4855.70 → 4856.92] Our task
[4856.92 → 4858.38] is to bring
[4858.38 → 4859.26] a sense
[4859.26 → 4860.12] of life
[4860.12 → 4861.66] to this world
[4861.66 → 4863.26] that because of sin
[4863.26 → 4864.48] is currently
[4864.48 → 4865.14] lifeless.
[4866.22 → 4867.48] A sense of soul
[4867.48 → 4868.66] and beauty
[4868.66 → 4870.16] and magnetism
[4870.16 → 4871.28] that is so compelling
[4871.28 → 4873.30] that even dead
[4873.30 → 4874.64] hearts are raised
[4874.64 → 4875.82] up in response
[4875.82 → 4876.52] to the grace
[4876.52 → 4877.78] of our good God.
[4877.78 → 4881.24] Israel's obedience
[4881.24 → 4881.80] was meant
[4881.80 → 4882.84] to reveal God
[4882.84 → 4883.84] in the midst
[4883.84 → 4884.86] of their life
[4884.86 → 4885.52] and to draw
[4885.52 → 4886.84] others to Him.
[4887.68 → 4888.92] Jesus' obedience
[4888.92 → 4889.90] reveals God
[4889.90 → 4890.58] and He makes
[4890.58 → 4891.96] salvation possible.
[4892.38 → 4893.20] That's what it means
[4893.20 → 4894.10] that Jesus lived
[4894.10 → 4895.28] the life I should have lived
[4895.28 → 4896.22] and died the death
[4896.22 → 4897.20] that I deserved.
[4897.78 → 4898.62] That even though
[4898.62 → 4899.82] He was perfect
[4899.82 → 4900.50] and innocent,
[4900.72 → 4901.28] He died
[4901.28 → 4902.68] a sinner's death,
[4902.78 → 4903.94] a cursed death
[4903.94 → 4904.52] for you,
[4904.76 → 4905.32] for me,
[4905.46 → 4906.60] in our place,
[4906.60 → 4907.98] hanging on that tree
[4907.98 → 4909.30] so that we might
[4909.30 → 4910.70] be raised with Him
[4910.70 → 4912.12] into newness
[4912.12 → 4913.20] of life.
[4913.32 → 4913.86] And now,
[4913.94 → 4915.02] our new life,
[4915.14 → 4916.08] our obedience,
[4916.28 → 4917.10] which is made possible
[4917.10 → 4918.24] only by Him
[4918.24 → 4919.00] and His Spirit,
[4919.66 → 4920.60] our obedience
[4920.60 → 4922.66] is to tell
[4922.66 → 4924.66] of the kingdom come
[4924.66 → 4926.12] and the kingdom coming.
[4926.70 → 4929.38] This is our shared witness.
[4930.94 → 4931.64] And in a world
[4931.64 → 4932.76] that sometimes feels
[4932.76 → 4933.70] like it has lost
[4933.70 → 4934.40] its soul,
[4935.30 → 4936.28] the foolishness
[4936.28 → 4937.10] of the gospel
[4937.10 → 4937.94] is compelling.
[4939.36 → 4940.22] In a world
[4940.22 → 4941.14] that sometimes feels
[4941.14 → 4941.96] like it has lost
[4941.96 → 4942.68] its mooring,
[4943.08 → 4944.02] the rootedness
[4944.02 → 4944.88] of the Bible
[4944.88 → 4947.28] is grounding
[4947.28 → 4948.74] for life
[4948.74 → 4950.02] and for purpose.
[4953.24 → 4956.06] As we go,
[4956.06 → 4960.70] as we grow
[4960.70 → 4962.72] and as we gather,
[4963.16 → 4963.98] we do so
[4963.98 → 4965.10] from here
[4965.10 → 4967.34] but also
[4967.34 → 4968.90] out there,
[4969.20 → 4969.96] also from
[4969.96 → 4970.96] wherever the here's
[4970.96 → 4972.96] are in your life.
[4973.36 → 4974.10] And so last week,
[4974.16 → 4974.70] if you were here,
[4974.80 → 4975.74] you heard me announce,
[4976.20 → 4977.76] if you received
[4977.76 → 4978.34] the bulletin,
[4978.40 → 4978.96] the e-bulletin,
[4979.08 → 4980.28] you will have read this
[4980.28 → 4980.80] hopefully
[4980.80 → 4981.92] or seen it online
[4981.92 → 4982.54] this week.
[4982.54 → 4984.34] we are launching
[4984.34 → 4985.88] as part of this season
[4985.88 → 4987.60] an art project,
[4987.70 → 4989.12] a community art project
[4989.12 → 4990.72] where we are asking you
[4990.72 → 4992.06] to submit photos
[4992.06 → 4993.86] of the places you love,
[4993.94 → 4994.86] the places where you
[4994.86 → 4996.72] spend your days
[4996.72 → 4997.86] or your nights,
[4998.00 → 4998.78] the places where you
[4998.78 → 4999.60] hang out together
[4999.60 → 5000.20] with people.
[5000.48 → 5001.88] It could be a swimming pool
[5001.88 → 5002.90] or an ice rink.
[5003.30 → 5005.12] It can be the park bench
[5005.12 → 5006.20] where you play chess.
[5006.78 → 5008.66] It can be where you go to work
[5008.66 → 5010.34] if that's what you truly love
[5010.34 → 5011.68] and find joy in
[5011.68 → 5012.78] because these places
[5012.78 → 5014.96] are your mission field.
[5015.12 → 5015.96] These are the places
[5015.96 → 5016.78] that you are called
[5016.78 → 5017.28] to gather,
[5017.50 → 5017.70] grow,
[5017.82 → 5019.48] and go here.
[5020.56 → 5021.24] And so submit
[5021.24 → 5023.44] to the office,
[5023.56 → 5024.30] to communications
[5024.30 → 5026.08] at licrc.ca
[5026.08 → 5027.18] a photo
[5027.18 → 5029.28] of these places
[5029.28 → 5030.86] and then we will create
[5030.86 → 5032.64] or the liturgical arts team
[5032.64 → 5033.36] will create
[5033.36 → 5034.34] a piece
[5034.34 → 5035.26] on the back there
[5035.26 → 5036.72] that calls us
[5036.72 → 5037.44] to remember
[5037.44 → 5038.84] each time we go out
[5038.84 → 5040.34] that we gather,
[5040.68 → 5040.92] grow,
[5041.06 → 5042.26] and go here.
[5042.72 → 5043.90] Not just in this space
[5043.90 → 5044.72] but in all of those
[5044.72 → 5045.64] other little places
[5045.64 → 5046.64] as well.
[5047.18 → 5047.94] That's where God
[5047.94 → 5049.64] has called us to.
[5050.40 → 5050.90] And so if you
[5050.90 → 5052.08] email those
[5052.08 → 5053.86] to Maria
[5053.86 → 5054.54] in the office,
[5054.66 → 5055.22] communications
[5055.22 → 5056.70] at licrc.ca
[5056.70 → 5057.48] or text them
[5057.48 → 5058.48] to me
[5058.48 → 5059.14] or to Kevin,
[5059.26 → 5059.70] we'll make sure
[5059.70 → 5060.38] that they get there.
[5060.80 → 5061.76] We've received some
[5061.76 → 5062.48] already this week
[5062.48 → 5063.14] and for those of you
[5063.14 → 5063.74] who have sent some,
[5063.84 → 5064.22] thank you.
[5064.56 → 5065.42] Keep that coming
[5065.42 → 5066.96] so we can get that going
[5066.96 → 5068.06] and so that we can
[5068.06 → 5069.00] throughout the year
[5069.00 → 5069.92] be reminded
[5069.92 → 5072.40] that this is
[5072.40 → 5074.32] why we gather.
[5074.82 → 5075.48] This is
[5075.48 → 5077.12] why we grow
[5077.12 → 5078.04] and this is
[5078.04 → 5079.86] why we go.
[5081.80 → 5083.38] That what we do
[5083.38 → 5084.20] here,
[5086.80 → 5088.26] that our obedience
[5088.26 → 5089.76] to Jesus
[5089.76 → 5091.28] in this life,
[5091.44 → 5091.88] that our
[5091.88 → 5093.62] beautiful life
[5093.62 → 5094.14] together,
[5094.36 → 5095.30] our shared
[5095.30 → 5096.26] witness,
[5096.66 → 5097.98] reveals God's
[5097.98 → 5098.80] presence
[5098.80 → 5100.16] among us
[5100.16 → 5102.38] and draws
[5102.38 → 5102.96] others
[5102.96 → 5104.14] to Him.
[5105.24 → 5106.42] This is
[5106.42 → 5107.70] why we
[5107.70 → 5108.62] exist
[5108.62 → 5110.64] because that
[5110.64 → 5111.48] is who
[5111.48 → 5112.24] God
[5112.24 → 5113.02] is.
[5113.94 → 5114.70] And so we go
[5114.70 → 5115.04] with Him.
[5115.54 → 5115.76] Amen?
[5116.76 → 5117.84] Let's pray together.
[5121.84 → 5122.92] Lord our God,

[5134.00 → 5134.82] of Your promise,
[5135.52 → 5136.52] in the truth
[5136.52 → 5137.20] of its being

[5144.38 → 5144.76] Lord God,

[5153.98 → 5155.00] hear our prayers,
[5155.12 → 5155.60] that You hear
[5155.60 → 5156.16] the cries
[5156.16 → 5157.02] of our heart.
[5157.10 → 5157.84] We go trusting
[5157.84 → 5158.48] that You
[5158.48 → 5159.76] are with us
[5159.76 → 5160.82] never to leave us

[5161.98 → 5163.02] that with You
[5163.02 → 5163.90] we can be
[5163.90 → 5165.18] strong and
[5165.18 → 5165.80] courageous
[5165.80 → 5166.72] because You

[5167.64 → 5168.26] the world,
[5168.34 → 5169.06] and as You say
