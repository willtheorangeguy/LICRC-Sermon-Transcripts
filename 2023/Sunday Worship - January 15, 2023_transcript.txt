[0.00 --> 7.36]  I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I'm not enough
[7.36 --> 20.26]  Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up
[20.26 --> 32.66]  Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low?
[38.32 --> 45.86]  Remind me once again just who I am because I need to know
[45.86 --> 55.74]  You say I'm loved when I can't feel a thing
[55.74 --> 62.26]  You say I'm strong when I think I'm weak
[62.26 --> 68.78]  And you say I'm held when I am falling short
[68.78 --> 72.06]  And when I don't belong
[72.06 --> 75.42]  Oh, you say I'm yours
[75.42 --> 78.64]  And I believe
[78.64 --> 79.18]  I
[79.18 --> 81.82]  Oh, I believe
[81.82 --> 82.48]  I
[82.48 --> 85.20]  What you say of me
[85.20 --> 85.74]  I
[85.74 --> 88.32]  I believe
[88.32 --> 97.42]  The only thing that matters now is everything you think of me
[97.42 --> 110.02]  In you I find my worth in you I find my identity
[110.02 --> 120.42]  You say I'm loved when I can't feel a thing
[120.42 --> 127.12]  You say I'm strong when I think I'm weak
[127.12 --> 133.50]  And you say I'm held when I am falling short
[133.50 --> 136.58]  When I don't belong
[136.58 --> 140.22]  Oh, you say I'm yours
[140.22 --> 141.60]  And I believe
[141.60 --> 143.44]  And I believe
[143.44 --> 145.44]  Oh, I believe
[145.44 --> 146.44]  Oh, I believe
[146.44 --> 147.44]  Oh, I believe
[147.44 --> 150.00]  What you say of me
[150.00 --> 152.44]  Oh, I believe
[152.44 --> 153.44]  Oh, I believe
[153.44 --> 166.92]  Taking all I have and now I'm laying it at your feet
[166.92 --> 171.24]  You say I'm held when I am
[171.24 --> 175.68]  You say I'm loved when I can't feel a thing
[175.68 --> 176.14]  Oh, I believe
[176.14 --> 181.14]  You say I'm strong when I think I'm weak

[211.14 --> 213.36]  Oh, I believe
[213.36 --> 214.36]  Oh, I believe
[214.36 --> 215.36]  Oh, I believe

[332.66 --> 334.66]  I
[334.66 --> 336.66]  I
[336.66 --> 338.66]  I
[338.66 --> 340.66]  I
[340.66 --> 342.66]  I

[348.66 --> 350.66]  I
[350.66 --> 352.66]  I
[352.66 --> 354.66]  I
[354.66 --> 359.54]  I
[359.54 --> 360.54]  I
[360.54 --> 362.60]  I
[362.60 --> 376.54]  I
[376.54 --> 378.54]  I
[378.54 --> 380.54]  I
[380.54 --> 382.54]  I
[382.54 --> 382.60]  I
[382.60 --> 383.54]  I
[383.54 --> 384.54]  I
[384.54 --> 392.92]  together. First, if you are a member of the youth group in high school, so grades
[392.92 --> 401.22]  9, 10, 11, yeah, we all know that. If you're a member of the youth group in
[401.22 --> 405.86]  grade 9 through grade 12, there's HCBC tonight and so that happens here at
[405.86 --> 409.54]  church. If you have any questions you can talk to Kevin, he'll figure it out. He
[409.54 --> 413.98]  doesn't know what's going on but he'll learn. You can talk to him following
[413.98 --> 418.30]  service. If you are visiting with us and you're looking for something for your
[418.30 --> 423.52]  kids to do or a way to engage, also talk to Kevin and he can explain what that
[423.52 --> 429.54]  looks like and how that might work for you and yours. Also, an announcement from
[429.54 --> 434.26]  the Usher team and so when you come into service each week, there's people in the
[434.26 --> 438.16]  back who have name tags, who are handing out worship folders and who are just
[438.16 --> 443.82]  generally mingling and helping out back there. We need a few others in that
[443.82 --> 448.00]  on that team and so if that's something that you think you might be able to do,
[448.00 --> 453.60]  you can talk to Rob. He's at the back. He's gonna wave. That's Rob back there. You
[453.60 --> 457.62]  can talk to him. He coordinates that team for us and he'd love to explain more
[457.62 --> 463.86]  about that and get you signed up for that. Also, Josh is gonna make an
[463.86 --> 468.14]  announcement on behalf of young adults.
[468.14 --> 474.02]  Hey young adults, just want to remind you that the potluck is tonight so bring
[474.02 --> 477.02]  some food to the church at 7 o'clock. Yeah, awesome.
[477.02 --> 490.90]  If none of that made sense to you, talk to Josh afterwards and he'll clarify all of that.
[492.70 --> 496.72]  As far as an announcement, I think that's it and then so as you are able and where
[496.72 --> 501.04]  you're seated, I'm gonna invite you to stand that we might be welcomed into God's
[501.04 --> 504.80]  presence and we might sing worship songs together.
[508.64 --> 517.60]  Gathering in the presence of God with his people, God is here. He is among us and he
[517.60 --> 527.44]  longs for us to encounter him in worship and so we mark that and we see that come true in our own
[527.44 --> 532.72]  hearts and minds with the greeting of God. Receive the greeting of God.
[533.76 --> 540.80]  Grace, mercy and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son
[540.80 --> 546.16]  and our Savior through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit. Everyone said?
[546.16 --> 548.96]  Amen. Let's worship God together.
[548.96 --> 560.32]  Our call to worship this morning comes from 1 Samuel chapter 2.
[560.32 --> 570.48]  My heart rejoices in the Lord. In the Lord my horn is lifted high. My mouth boasts over my enemies,
[570.48 --> 578.88]  for I delight in your deliverance. There is no one holy like the Lord. There is no one beside you.
[578.96 --> 581.92]  There is no rock like our God.
[581.92 --> 585.92]  There is no rock like our God.
[585.92 --> 597.92]  You'll be preaching to you, God is lifted high.
[597.92 --> 610.56]  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God almighty, Lord God almighty, early in the morning.
[610.56 --> 622.24]  Early in the morning, our song shall rise to thee.
[622.24 --> 636.36]  Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty.
[636.36 --> 648.22]  God in thee, persons, blessed Trinity.
[651.22 --> 664.40]  Holy, holy, holy, all the saints adore thee.
[664.40 --> 677.40]  Casting down their golden crowns around the galaxy sea.
[678.68 --> 691.26]  Cherubim and seraphim, falling down before thee.
[691.26 --> 704.26]  Though words and arts then evermore shall be.
[704.26 --> 718.26]  Holy, holy, holy, though the darkness hide thee.
[718.26 --> 730.26]  Though the eye may blind by sin, thy glory may not see.
[730.26 --> 744.26]  Only thou art holy, there is none beside thee.
[744.26 --> 755.80]  Perfect in power, in love and purity.
[755.80 --> 773.14]  dol-
[773.14 --> 793.14]  I bow before Thee, King of glory.
[793.14 --> 801.14]  Hold me, dear Lord, and I'm beside Thee.
[803.14 --> 814.02]  Perfect in power, my God forever.
[814.02 --> 823.90]  You are and are and you will be.
[824.32 --> 833.60]  I bow before Thee, King of glory.
[834.68 --> 841.02]  Holy are you, Lord, none beside Thee.
[841.02 --> 854.26]  Perfect in power, my God forever.
[856.68 --> 864.38]  You are and are and you will be.
[864.38 --> 882.56]  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God almighty.
[882.56 --> 895.56]  All Thy works shall praise Thy name in earth and sky and sea.
[895.56 --> 909.38]  Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty.
[909.38 --> 920.72]  God in three persons, blessed Trinity.
[922.00 --> 925.38]  I stand before Thee.
[925.38 --> 938.38]  King of glory, holy, holy, are you, Lord, none beside Thee.
[938.38 --> 951.38]  Perfect in power, my God forever.
[951.38 --> 960.38]  You were and are and you will be.
[960.38 --> 962.38]  God in power, my God forever.
[962.38 --> 965.38]  I stand before Thee.
[965.38 --> 970.38]  King of glory, holy, are you, Lord.
[970.38 --> 975.38]  Holy, holy, holy, are you, Lord.
[975.38 --> 979.38]  Holy, holy, are you, Lord, none beside Thee.
[979.38 --> 985.38]  Perfect in power, my God forever.
[985.38 --> 987.38]  My God forever.
[987.38 --> 992.38]  My God forever.
[992.38 --> 1002.38]  You are and are and you will be.
[1002.38 --> 1031.38]  Happy and be the king.
[1031.38 --> 1035.88]  Who else commands all the hosts of heaven?
[1037.66 --> 1042.34]  Who else could make every king bow down?
[1042.34 --> 1048.34]  Who else can whisper in darkness trumbles?
[1049.62 --> 1053.68]  Only a holy God.
[1053.68 --> 1061.62]  What other beauty demands such pieces?
[1062.32 --> 1068.12]  What other splendor outshines the sun?
[1069.12 --> 1074.22]  What other majesty rules with justice?
[1075.54 --> 1079.18]  Only a holy God.
[1079.18 --> 1086.94]  Come and behold Him.
[1087.28 --> 1092.18]  Go on and behold Him.
[1092.54 --> 1096.40]  Cry and sing holy.
[1097.02 --> 1100.86]  Forever a holy God.
[1100.86 --> 1105.34]  Come and worship the holy God.
[1109.18 --> 1115.28]  Come and worship the holy God.
[1115.28 --> 1120.68]  What other glory consumes like fire?
[1122.04 --> 1126.66]  What other power can raise the dead?
[1127.72 --> 1132.38]  What other name remains undefeated?
[1132.38 --> 1137.14]  Home and stay safely.
[1137.14 --> 1140.40]  Why as he protected?
[1140.40 --> 1141.58]  MyС router.
[1141.58 --> 1142.12]  I bless you.
[1142.12 --> 1145.44]  What other power can effectively have traveled?
[1145.44 --> 1162.98]  One and the only cry out, sing holy, forever a holy God, come and worship the holy God.
[1162.98 --> 1186.18]  Come and behold Him, the one and the only. Cry and sing holy, forever a holy God. Come and worship the holy God.
[1192.98 --> 1220.46]  Who else could rescue me from my failings? Who else would offer His only Son?
[1220.46 --> 1231.40]  Who else invites me to call Him Father? Only a holy God.
[1231.40 --> 1237.22]  Only my holy God.
[1239.22 --> 1247.84]  Come and behold Him, the one and the only.
[1247.84 --> 1256.78]  Cry and sing holy, forever a holy God.
[1256.78 --> 1261.66]  Come and worship the holy God.
[1262.66 --> 1271.26]  Come and behold Him, the one and the only.
[1271.26 --> 1280.20]  Cry and sing holy, forever a holy God.
[1280.20 --> 1284.78]  Come and worship the holy God.
[1284.78 --> 1290.14]  Come and worship the holy God.
[1293.14 --> 1305.90]  Please join me in our prayer of confession this morning.
[1305.90 --> 1312.04]  Father, you are a holy God.
[1312.84 --> 1315.10]  You are the only holy God.
[1315.10 --> 1325.40]  And because of that, we come to you in our time of confession this morning, praying for your forgiveness.
[1325.40 --> 1329.94]  Lord, your glory consumes like fire.
[1330.94 --> 1332.50]  It can raise the dead.
[1332.50 --> 1338.58]  And we know, Father, that your power and your spirit can forgive us.
[1338.58 --> 1349.32]  You are the only one who can rescue us from our failing of all the things that we've done this week, of all the things that we've left undone.
[1349.32 --> 1354.90]  Father, we confess to you that we have fallen short.
[1357.22 --> 1359.78]  Lord, but you invite us to call you Father.
[1360.54 --> 1363.88]  And you invite us into your grace and your mercy.
[1364.18 --> 1365.08]  And we thank you.
[1365.82 --> 1367.28]  Thank you for your forgiveness.
[1369.28 --> 1371.10]  We pray this in Jesus' name.
[1371.82 --> 1372.08]  Amen.
[1372.08 --> 1372.24]  Amen.
[1372.24 --> 1381.72]  Lord's Day 6 has two questions that we'd like to read this morning.
[1381.88 --> 1387.88]  So I will read the first question and have you respond with the words on the screen and then follow Kevin's question as well.
[1388.46 --> 1391.84]  Please stand as we respond with these words.
[1395.52 --> 1396.70]  Lord's Day 6.
[1396.70 --> 1404.76]  Who is that mediator who at the same time is true God and a true and righteous man?
[1418.10 --> 1419.98]  From where do you know this?
[1420.98 --> 1422.74]  From the Holy Ghost.
[1422.74 --> 1443.38]  Romans 10 verse 4 says,
[1443.38 --> 1451.48]  Christ is the culmination of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.
[1452.74 --> 1482.32]  I know a place, a wonderful place.
[1482.32 --> 1486.32]  There are accused and condemned.
[1487.32 --> 1491.60]  Find mercy and grace.
[1491.60 --> 1496.04]  There the wrongs we have done.
[1496.04 --> 1500.72]  And the wrongs done to us.
[1500.72 --> 1505.80]  Were nailed there in the name.
[1506.58 --> 1510.14]  There am the cross.
[1510.14 --> 1511.14]  At the cross.
[1511.14 --> 1513.14]  At the cross.
[1513.14 --> 1517.14]  At the cross.
[1517.14 --> 1521.34]  He died for our sin.
[1521.34 --> 1524.14]  At the cross.
[1524.14 --> 1526.14]  At the cross.
[1526.14 --> 1530.46]  You gave us life again.
[1530.46 --> 1542.60]  I know a place, a wonderful place
[1542.60 --> 1551.56]  Where accused and condemned find mercy and grace
[1551.56 --> 1560.80]  Where the wrongs we have done and the wrongs done to us
[1560.80 --> 1570.56]  Were near there with you, near on the cross
[1570.56 --> 1580.56]  At the cross, at the cross, he died for our sin
[1580.56 --> 1599.38]  At the cross, at the cross, he died for our sin
[1599.38 --> 1608.56]  At the cross, at the cross, you gave us life again
[1610.56 --> 1622.38]  I know a place, a wonderful place
[1622.38 --> 1644.86]  I'm calling on the God of Jacob
[1644.86 --> 1651.56]  Whose love endures through generations
[1651.56 --> 1660.04]  I know that you will be pure love for me
[1660.04 --> 1665.74]  I'm calling on the God of Moses
[1665.74 --> 1672.36]  The one who opened up the ocean
[1672.36 --> 1681.12]  I need you now to do the same thing for me
[1681.12 --> 1691.14]  Oh God, my God, I need you
[1691.14 --> 1695.70]  Oh God, my God, I need you now
[1695.70 --> 1699.54]  How I need you now
[1699.54 --> 1705.24]  Oh God, my God, my God, I need you now
[1705.24 --> 1709.36]  I'm standing on your faithfulness
[1709.36 --> 1714.42]  On your faithfulness
[1714.42 --> 1718.12]  I'm calling on the God of David
[1718.12 --> 1721.12]  I'm calling on the God of David
[1721.12 --> 1726.24]  I'm calling on the God of David
[1726.24 --> 1732.12]  I know with you all things are possible
[1732.12 --> 1734.76]  I know with you all things are possible
[1734.76 --> 1739.12]  I'm calling on the God of David
[1739.12 --> 1745.02]  Who made a shepherd boy for maintenance
[1745.02 --> 1750.62]  I may not face Goliath
[1750.62 --> 1752.80]  But I've got none of the giants
[1752.80 --> 1765.42]  Oh, God, my God, I need you. Oh, God, my God, I need you now. How I need you now.
[1766.88 --> 1775.42]  Oh, rock, oh, rock of ages, I'm standing on your faithfulness.
[1775.42 --> 1786.16]  You heard your children and you hear your children.
[1787.08 --> 1793.66]  You are the same, God. You are the same, God.
[1794.12 --> 1800.36]  You answered prayers by then and you will answer now.
[1800.36 --> 1806.82]  You are the same, God. You are the same, God.
[1807.34 --> 1813.56]  You were providing then. You are providing now.
[1813.56 --> 1819.86]  You are the same, God. You are the same, God.
[1820.60 --> 1826.74]  You worked in power then. God, move in power now.
[1826.74 --> 1833.20]  You are the same, God. You are the same, God.
[1833.40 --> 1839.78]  You were a healer then. You are a healer now.
[1840.16 --> 1846.20]  You are the same, God. You are the same, God.
[1846.20 --> 1852.66]  You were a healer then. You are a healer now.
[1852.66 --> 1859.12]  You are the same, God. You are the same, God.
[1859.50 --> 1866.56]  Oh, God, my God, I need you. Oh, God, my God, I need you now.
[1866.56 --> 1870.38]  Now I need you now.
[1872.22 --> 1880.78]  Oh, rock, oh, rock of ages, I'm standing on your faithfulness.
[1881.02 --> 1885.02]  On your faithfulness.
[1885.02 --> 1907.26]  Oh, rock, oh, rock of ages, I'm standing on your faithfulness.
[1907.26 --> 1911.72]  Oh, rock of ages, I'm standing on your faithfulness.
[1911.72 --> 1918.40]  You freed the captives then. You're freeing hearts right now.
[1918.40 --> 1924.92]  You are the same, God. You are the same, God.
[1924.92 --> 1931.54]  You touched the lepers then. I feel your touch right now.
[1931.54 --> 1938.54]  You are the same, God.
[1938.54 --> 1940.54]  You are the same, God.
[1950.54 --> 1956.54]  I'm calling on the Holy Spirit.
[1956.54 --> 1964.54]  Oh, mighty river, come and fill me again.
[1966.54 --> 1971.54]  Come and fill me again.
[1973.54 --> 1978.96]  Come and fill me again.
[1981.54 --> 1983.54]  You may have a seat.
[1986.54 --> 2007.54]  You may have a seat.
[2007.54 --> 2011.54]  Hi. I forgot my paper at home.
[2011.54 --> 2015.54]  The collections today are for the Budget First, for our church,
[2015.54 --> 2018.54]  and the second one is for the Gateway of Hope.
[2018.54 --> 2020.54]  They do a lot of good work,
[2020.54 --> 2026.54]  and they have one-on-one interactions with people,
[2026.54 --> 2030.54]  and they have shelters for men and women.
[2030.54 --> 2035.54]  And please pay as you are blessed.
[2035.54 --> 2036.54]  Amen.
[2036.54 --> 2037.54]  Whoa.
[2037.54 --> 2038.54]  Whoa.
[2038.54 --> 2039.54]  Whoo.
[2039.54 --> 2040.54]  Wow.
[2040.54 --> 2043.54]  Whoa.
[2043.54 --> 2044.54]  Whoa.
[2044.54 --> 2046.54]  Whoa.
[2046.54 --> 2048.54]  Whoa.
[2048.54 --> 2050.54]  Whoa.
[2050.54 --> 2053.54]  Whoa.
[2053.54 --> 2055.54]  Whoa.
[2055.54 --> 2056.54]  Whoa.
[2056.54 --> 2057.54]  Whoa, whoa.
[2057.54 --> 2060.54]  Whoa.
[2060.54 --> 2061.54]  Whoa.
[2061.54 --> 2062.54] ?
[2067.54 --> 2080.26]  Turn your eyes upon Jesus, look full in his wonderful face,
[2080.26 --> 2094.38]  and the kings of earth will grow strangely dim in the light of his glory and praise.
[2097.54 --> 2111.86]  Turn your eyes to the hills where justice and mercy embrace.
[2111.86 --> 2124.90]  There the Son of God gave his life for us, and our measureless debt was erased.
[2124.90 --> 2138.90]  Jesus, to you we lift our eyes, Jesus, our glory and our prize.
[2138.90 --> 2147.14]  We adore you, behold you, our Savior ever true.
[2147.14 --> 2152.98]  O Jesus, we turn our eyes to you.
[2152.98 --> 2176.98]  Turn your eyes to the morning, and see Christ the Lion away.
[2176.98 --> 2190.98]  What a glorious dawn, fear of death is gone, for we carry his life in our face.
[2190.98 --> 2204.98]  Jesus, to you we lift our eyes, Jesus, our glory and our prize.
[2204.98 --> 2210.98]  We adore you, we hold you, our Savior ever true.
[2210.98 --> 2216.98]  O Jesus, we turn our eyes to you.
[2216.98 --> 2240.98]  Turn your eyes to the heavens, our King will return for his own.
[2240.98 --> 2255.98]  Every knee will bow, every tongue will shout, all glory to Jesus, our Lord.
[2255.98 --> 2269.98]  Jesus, to you we lift our eyes, Jesus, our glory and our prize.
[2269.98 --> 2276.98]  We adore you, we adore you, behold you, our Savior ever true.
[2276.98 --> 2282.98]  O Jesus, we turn our eyes to you.
[2282.98 --> 2288.98]  O Jesus, we turn our eyes to you.
[2288.98 --> 2311.98]  O Jesus, we turn our eyes to you.
[2311.98 --> 2314.98]  Good morning, my name is Mr. Mike.
[2314.98 --> 2318.98]  And any kids three years old up to grade four, you're welcome to come up.
[2318.98 --> 2321.98]  And we're going to have a quick chat, and we'll do a children's blessing,
[2321.98 --> 2325.98]  and then we'll go off to children's worship time.
[2325.98 --> 2328.98]  Hi, some of you guys have name tags, that's pretty great.
[2328.98 --> 2330.98]  Yeah, that makes everyone know who you are.
[2330.98 --> 2332.98]  That's really welcoming, isn't it?
[2332.98 --> 2333.98]  How are you guys?
[2333.98 --> 2334.98]  Good.
[2334.98 --> 2337.98]  A little bit of sleep still, maybe?
[2337.98 --> 2338.98]  No.
[2338.98 --> 2339.98]  No.
[2339.98 --> 2342.98]  Well, I have a quick guessing game that we're going to play.
[2342.98 --> 2344.98]  Here's a little quick one, and I apologize to the church,
[2344.98 --> 2346.98]  because I wasn't able to get it on the overhead,
[2346.98 --> 2348.98]  but I have two pictures I'm going to show you,
[2348.98 --> 2353.98]  and you have to guess who these people might be.
[2353.98 --> 2354.98]  Okay?
[2354.98 --> 2358.98]  Here's the first one.
[2358.98 --> 2360.98]  Who is that?
[2360.98 --> 2361.98]  Me?
[2361.98 --> 2362.98]  Me?
[2362.98 --> 2364.98]  How did you guess that?
[2364.98 --> 2369.98]  You know, it's because I put on the extra little bit of chin fuzz, right?
[2369.98 --> 2371.98]  That you're like, oh, that's Mr. Mike, for sure.
[2371.98 --> 2374.98]  I just was so anxious to have a beard.
[2374.98 --> 2375.98]  Here's one more picture.
[2375.98 --> 2378.98]  I think some of you will for sure know who this is.
[2378.98 --> 2380.98]  Who might this guy be?
[2380.98 --> 2381.98]  Me, again?
[2381.98 --> 2383.98]  No, it's not me, not this time.
[2383.98 --> 2384.98]  Somebody else.
[2384.98 --> 2385.98]  Somebody else.
[2385.98 --> 2387.98]  But you know who this guy is.
[2387.98 --> 2390.98]  Do you have any guesses?
[2394.98 --> 2396.98]  Oh, are you pointing?
[2396.98 --> 2398.98]  It's Pastor Kevin.
[2398.98 --> 2400.98]  When he was a kid.
[2400.98 --> 2401.98]  You might be surprised.
[2401.98 --> 2403.98]  This is a picture of me as a kid, too.
[2403.98 --> 2404.98]  Right?
[2404.98 --> 2406.98]  Oh, my goodness.
[2406.98 --> 2409.98]  So we're going to talk about some crazy stuff today.
[2409.98 --> 2414.98]  And did you guys know that your moms and dads or grandmas and grandpas or big brothers,
[2414.98 --> 2418.98]  all these other people in your lives, they were kids once, too?
[2418.98 --> 2419.98]  Yeah?
[2419.98 --> 2423.98]  Can you picture your dad or mom or who takes care of you?
[2423.98 --> 2425.98]  Can you picture them as a little kid?
[2425.98 --> 2426.98]  Yeah?
[2426.98 --> 2428.98]  Have you ever seen pictures of them as little kids?
[2428.98 --> 2429.98]  Yeah?
[2429.98 --> 2434.98]  Well, if you haven't, you should ask because I bet you it would be awesome to see some pictures.
[2434.98 --> 2435.98]  Right?
[2435.98 --> 2437.98]  Well, guess who else was a little kid?
[2437.98 --> 2442.98]  We just started learning about this in Sunday school last week.
[2442.98 --> 2444.98]  Who were we talking about?
[2444.98 --> 2446.98]  Who went to the temple as a baby?
[2446.98 --> 2447.98]  Big trip.
[2447.98 --> 2448.98]  Jesus.
[2448.98 --> 2450.98]  He went to the temple as a baby.
[2450.98 --> 2454.98]  And it was a big promise fulfilled for Simeon and Anna.
[2454.98 --> 2455.98]  Right?
[2455.98 --> 2456.98]  Yeah.
[2456.98 --> 2457.98]  We talked about that last week.
[2457.98 --> 2461.98]  And now we're going to talk about Jesus going back to the temple as a kid.
[2461.98 --> 2468.98]  And it's crazy to think that Jesus, who's also God, he was a kid once, just like all of us.
[2468.98 --> 2469.98]  Okay.
[2469.98 --> 2471.98]  We'll talk more about that in children's worship time.
[2471.98 --> 2473.98]  But shall we stand and do the blessing first?
[2473.98 --> 2476.98]  And then we will go learn a little bit more together in the room.
[2476.98 --> 2477.98]  Okay, arms up.
[2477.98 --> 2478.98]  Ready?
[2478.98 --> 2479.98]  The Lord be with you.
[2479.98 --> 2481.98]  The Lord be with you.
[2481.98 --> 2482.98]  The Lord be with you.
[2482.98 --> 2488.98]  And all of you.
[2502.98 --> 2507.98]  I was a very cute child.
[2507.98 --> 2508.98]  My name's Kevin Lobert.
[2508.98 --> 2510.98]  For those who don't know me, I'm the youth pastor here today.
[2510.98 --> 2513.98]  And it's my privilege to lead you in today's church family prayer.
[2513.98 --> 2516.98]  Before I do that though, I've got a couple of announcements.
[2516.98 --> 2520.98]  The first is that the Mexico team sign up has come and gone.
[2520.98 --> 2525.98]  And we have an exciting team of at least eight youth and eight adults going this March.
[2525.98 --> 2527.98]  And so we've got a good showing.
[2527.98 --> 2532.98]  I'm really excited to hear about what they are all going to do down there and what they're up to.
[2532.98 --> 2533.98]  So I think that's really, really exciting.
[2533.98 --> 2534.98]  They'll be heading down in March.
[2534.98 --> 2541.98]  You'll be hearing more about that trip from the team members and from Brandon Muller as well as the date gets closer and closer.
[2541.98 --> 2545.98]  But please keep them in your prayers as they prepare over the next two months to go on that.
[2545.98 --> 2548.98]  The second announcement's a two-parter.
[2548.98 --> 2558.98]  The first is that if you have announcements that you want to get in the bulletin, prayer requests or other things, there's a new email address.
[2558.98 --> 2561.98]  It's in the bulletin already and it's in the midweek memo.
[2561.98 --> 2570.98]  But if you have announcements you want to send to the church to get in there, please send those to communications, with an S, communications at LICRC.ca.
[2570.98 --> 2573.98]  Again, check the bulletin and the midweek memo for that email.
[2573.98 --> 2578.98]  But send those there and they will make their way into the bulletin and midweek memos.
[2578.98 --> 2585.98]  And the reason we've done that is because there is now a new position available that you can apply for in this church.
[2585.98 --> 2588.98]  We are looking for another administrator, a communications position.
[2588.98 --> 2593.98]  If that's something that you're interested in applying in, you can check out the job description on our website.
[2593.98 --> 2598.98]  You can talk to the staff here at the church or you can check out the bulletins as well.
[2598.98 --> 2602.98]  So I believe that position is going to be open for a couple more weeks.
[2602.98 --> 2608.98]  So please, if that is something that interests you, please give that a look and consider applying.
[2608.98 --> 2611.98]  Will you bow your heads with me?
[2617.98 --> 2620.98]  Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
[2620.98 --> 2623.98]  We give you praise for who you are, God.
[2623.98 --> 2628.98]  As we sang this morning, you are holy, holy, holy.
[2628.98 --> 2633.98]  And we thank you, Lord, for your work in our lives and for the gift of your son.
[2633.98 --> 2640.98]  As we reflect on how he came into this world as a baby, and as he lived a perfect life that we have all fallen short of.
[2640.98 --> 2648.98]  And as he died a cruel death all of us deserve, but rose again three days later, defeating sin and death once and for all.
[2648.98 --> 2652.98]  God, may that truth sink into our hearts.
[2652.98 --> 2655.98]  Lord, we marvel at this truth.
[2655.98 --> 2661.98]  May we remember, Jesus, that you are our king, sovereignly reigning from your throne over your kingdom.
[2661.98 --> 2667.98]  May your kingdom come, Lord, and your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[2667.98 --> 2671.98]  Lord Jesus, our world seems to be tearing apart.
[2671.98 --> 2673.98]  War is prevalent.
[2673.98 --> 2678.98]  We think of countries like Ukraine as they continue to resist attacks from Russia.
[2678.98 --> 2685.98]  We think of countries like Myanmar, Colombia, Ethiopia, and Mali, all of which who are going through terrible civil wars as well.
[2685.98 --> 2690.98]  As people are displaced in these countries, may you show them mercy, Lord.
[2690.98 --> 2693.98]  Let us, your global church, be your hands and feet for them.
[2693.98 --> 2695.98]  May your kingdom come, Lord.
[2695.98 --> 2698.98]  We think of places where Christians are being persecuted.
[2698.98 --> 2704.98]  Places like Burma, China, Eritrea, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, and India.
[2704.98 --> 2707.98]  Lord, our brothers and sisters are suffering in your name.
[2707.98 --> 2709.98]  May that bring you glory, Lord.
[2709.98 --> 2712.98]  And may your name be praised by those witnessing that.
[2712.98 --> 2716.98]  But God, our God, stop the hate.
[2716.98 --> 2720.98]  May your name reign in those places without the need for violence.
[2720.98 --> 2722.98]  May your peace shine through.
[2722.98 --> 2729.98]  And God, be with our country who is divided on so many things, Lord.
[2729.98 --> 2734.98]  Bring understanding, empathy, and cause unity amongst us.
[2734.98 --> 2740.98]  Lord, give us all here today wisdom, not to align with man-made political parties,
[2740.98 --> 2745.98]  but to allow us to align with your word and what it calls us to do.
[2745.98 --> 2751.98]  Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.
[2751.98 --> 2754.98]  We thank you for everything you have blessed us with, Lord.
[2754.98 --> 2755.98]  We have so much.
[2755.98 --> 2759.98]  And yet, Lord Jesus, even in our providence, we still need much.
[2759.98 --> 2762.98]  We think of those struggling with their physical or mental health.
[2762.98 --> 2766.98]  For those who have anxiety or depression, who are grieving or frustrated,
[2766.98 --> 2769.98]  who are confused or lonely or afraid.
[2769.98 --> 2771.98]  Father, give them what they need.
[2771.98 --> 2775.98]  And may we as a church surround them with love and understanding.
[2775.98 --> 2779.98]  Lord, we pray for those who are caring for aging parents.
[2779.98 --> 2781.98]  Give them what they need.
[2781.98 --> 2786.98]  We pray for the Grimm and the Heinen family, Lord, as they mourn the death of Helen,
[2786.98 --> 2792.98]  a beloved wife, stepmom, sister, sister-in-law.
[2792.98 --> 2797.98]  Lord, we pray for them as they prepare for the funeral on February 15th.
[2797.98 --> 2802.98]  Give that family peace and comfort and surround them with your love.
[2802.98 --> 2810.98]  Lord, we think of Benita as well as she has a biopsy coming up at the end of this month to look at a lump, Lord.
[2810.98 --> 2812.98]  God, we pray for good results to that.
[2812.98 --> 2814.98]  May she heal from this.
[2814.98 --> 2817.98]  Will you be near them as well?
[2817.98 --> 2820.98]  And God, our church rejoices as well.
[2820.98 --> 2822.98]  God, we rejoice with the howlings.
[2822.98 --> 2825.98]  We thank you for the birth of Gus, Lord.
[2825.98 --> 2827.98]  Thank you that he is a healthy boy.
[2827.98 --> 2832.98]  Be with Ismay and Daniel as they continue to recover from his birth
[2832.98 --> 2835.98]  and also get used to this new reality that they live in.
[2835.98 --> 2838.98]  Help him continue to grow healthy and strong.
[2838.98 --> 2841.98]  Lord, we thank you for the work of Sylvia here in this church, Lord.
[2841.98 --> 2844.98]  And as her time came to an end here at Emmanuel at the end of December,
[2844.98 --> 2849.98]  Lord, will you be with her now as she continues on in new adventures.
[2849.98 --> 2855.98]  But Lord, as her position is now available, we pray for whomever it is that is applying and going to get that spot.
[2855.98 --> 2858.98]  Lord, we pray for the right fit for our congregation.
[2858.98 --> 2861.98]  May you guide them to this church.
[2861.98 --> 2864.98]  And finally, Lord, we ask collectively for forgiveness.
[2864.98 --> 2867.98]  Forgiveness when we know we have sinned.
[2867.98 --> 2870.98]  Forgiveness when we don't even realize we are sinning.
[2870.98 --> 2874.98]  In our stubbornness and our ignorance, grant us forgiveness, we pray.
[2874.98 --> 2878.98]  And if we need to forgive others, may your spirit convict us here today.
[2878.98 --> 2880.98]  Show us those who need our forgiveness.
[2880.98 --> 2883.98]  Show us those we need to apologize to.
[2883.98 --> 2887.98]  May we seek out those whose relationships with us are tenuous at best.
[2887.98 --> 2891.98]  And let not our pride or our anger get in the way of what you call us to do.
[2891.98 --> 2896.98]  May we forgive others as you have forgiven us.
[2896.98 --> 2900.98]  And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.
[2900.98 --> 2902.98]  You are our savior.
[2902.98 --> 2905.98]  You have given us immeasurable gifts of love and grace.
[2905.98 --> 2910.98]  You have also promised us that you will always give us a way out when we are tempted to sin.
[2910.98 --> 2915.98]  May your Holy Spirit stir in our hearts, God, and grant us self-control when we are tempted.
[2915.98 --> 2920.98]  Keep the evil one from us and may we know that you are forever nearby when we are tempted to stray.
[2920.98 --> 2925.98]  And as we open your word here in a few moments, we pray that you will be with Pastor Chris.
[2925.98 --> 2934.98]  May he speak your words to us, not his own, and may we have ears to hear, hearts ready to be molded, and minds ready to engage your Holy Word this morning.
[2934.98 --> 2938.98]  For yours is the kingdom, the power, and the glory forever.
[2938.98 --> 2939.98]  Amen.
[2939.98 --> 2940.98]  Amen.
[2940.98 --> 2942.98]  Amen.
[2950.98 --> 2955.56]  thể потому
[2955.56 --> 2971.10]  As Kevin prayed, and if you have one of those worship sheets, you will notice we're going
[2971.10 --> 2977.56]  to continue in our teaching series right now in the book of Romans.
[2978.56 --> 2980.72]  We're only reading two verses today.
[2985.56 --> 2991.72]  Because as you will see, those two verses are quite packed, and really we're only going
[2991.72 --> 2996.26]  to focus on the first one that we're going to read, because I didn't want to keep you
[2996.26 --> 2997.74]  here for 45 minutes.
[2999.82 --> 3006.26]  But can you put the slide with the slider up?
[3006.68 --> 3008.42]  So the one that says where Romans is.
[3008.48 --> 3008.88]  There you go.
[3008.88 --> 3016.78]  So if you are new here, or if you are unsure, whenever we come to read from the Bible,
[3017.42 --> 3019.74]  there's this slider that appears across the bottom.
[3019.94 --> 3023.16]  And so on the left-hand side, it says Genesis.
[3023.38 --> 3024.86]  On the right-hand side, it says Revelation.
[3025.28 --> 3028.26]  And then the book that we're reading from is highlighted there.
[3028.74 --> 3033.56]  If you're unfamiliar with the Bible, that's approximately where in the Bible you will
[3033.56 --> 3034.52]  find our text.
[3034.52 --> 3041.82]  And so at, what is that, like 11th, 16th way through the Bible, you will find the book
[3041.82 --> 3042.26]  of Romans.
[3042.58 --> 3049.88]  So really, what we're trying to do is say, grab your Bible, and then open it up to wherever
[3049.88 --> 3054.68]  we happen to be, and then read along and keep that with you.
[3055.94 --> 3061.52]  I'm going to read this morning, as we said, from Romans 1, verse 16 and 17.
[3061.52 --> 3066.10]  So now that you all know where that is and how to find it, let's read together.
[3070.80 --> 3077.84]  For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation
[3077.84 --> 3084.32]  to everyone who believes, first to the Jew, then to the Gentile.
[3084.32 --> 3091.52]  For in the gospel, the righteousness of God is revealed, a righteousness that is by faith
[3091.52 --> 3093.72]  from first to last.
[3094.78 --> 3099.76]  Just as it is written, the righteous will live by faith.
[3100.56 --> 3101.62]  This is the word of the Lord.
[3101.62 --> 3109.32]  Now, because there's a lot I hope we can get through this morning, I'm going to just jump
[3109.32 --> 3109.86]  right in.
[3110.72 --> 3118.54]  But I'm going to start by saying I think that you can make a pretty compelling case that
[3118.54 --> 3125.42]  these two verses in the book of Romans, in the first chapter, are the sort of big idea
[3125.42 --> 3128.22]  of the whole letter to the Romans.
[3129.18 --> 3133.02]  Now, that's language you might be familiar with, because sometimes you will hear me say
[3133.02 --> 3139.02]  when I'm standing up here preaching that the big idea of what we're going to talk about
[3139.02 --> 3144.08]  this morning, or the theme sort of under which we're going to operate or ask questions this
[3144.08 --> 3144.36]  morning.
[3145.52 --> 3151.04]  I think that's what Paul is doing at the beginning of Romans with these two verses.
[3151.04 --> 3158.42]  I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone
[3158.42 --> 3159.66]  who believes.
[3160.22 --> 3164.24]  So we're going to dig into that first this morning.
[3166.32 --> 3174.32]  Now, at least when I read the Bible, and when I'm talking to people and they ask, how am
[3174.32 --> 3180.74]  I supposed to read the Bible, one of my favorite things to do is to come with questions.
[3181.04 --> 3183.80]  And so as you read, ask questions.
[3184.14 --> 3185.26]  Ask questions of the text.
[3185.68 --> 3187.40]  Ask questions of what's going on.
[3187.46 --> 3188.60]  Maybe it's something strange.
[3188.70 --> 3190.74]  Maybe it's something you're not sure that you understand.
[3190.94 --> 3193.92]  Maybe it's a word that's really interesting, and you're like, oh, I wonder about that.
[3194.06 --> 3197.40]  And then write that down, and then spend some time looking at it.
[3198.26 --> 3205.34]  As I read these verses, when Paul says, I am not ashamed of the gospel, it makes me ask
[3205.34 --> 3209.72]  the question, why would someone be ashamed of the gospel?
[3211.26 --> 3215.80]  Remember, the gospel literally means good news.
[3215.80 --> 3223.42]  The gospel is good news from God about his son, heralding Jesus' victory over sin and
[3223.42 --> 3229.40]  death by his taking on flesh, by living a perfect life in our place, by dying death on the cross
[3229.40 --> 3235.32]  in our place, by being raised bodily, right, which is a promise of our future resurrection.
[3235.62 --> 3240.56]  The gospel includes Jesus' exaltation to the right hand of the gospel.
[3240.56 --> 3247.54]  In short, right to the right hand of God, in short, the gospel is the good news of Jesus
[3247.54 --> 3250.30]  making you right with God.
[3251.08 --> 3253.40]  And why would anyone be ashamed of that?
[3257.74 --> 3266.38]  I heard a story this week about a church here in the Lower Mainland that had a beautiful
[3266.38 --> 3269.22]  sanctuary worship space.
[3269.22 --> 3276.00]  At the front of this historic old building was a hand-carved pulpit for the pastor to
[3276.00 --> 3282.06]  stand in, and then behind the stage was this beautiful old wooden cross.
[3284.08 --> 3285.38]  Now, two things.
[3285.48 --> 3291.78]  One, I'm hesitant to talk about other churches and their decisions, because most of the time
[3291.78 --> 3295.22]  it's just a matter of preference, and it's not my preference, so then I don't have to
[3295.22 --> 3296.28]  agree, and that's okay.
[3296.28 --> 3301.20]  Also, when I'm talking about the worship space of other churches, I'm cognizant of the fact
[3301.20 --> 3307.96]  that we have a pretty unadorned and modern worship space, and so maybe the parallels don't line
[3307.96 --> 3308.16]  up.
[3308.54 --> 3314.80]  But I'm also aware that sometimes we have to ask each other hard questions, right?
[3314.80 --> 3322.72]  Because the story that I heard from this church and their pastor is that they decided to turn
[3322.72 --> 3328.40]  all the chairs in their sanctuary space 90 degrees to the left.
[3330.40 --> 3339.86]  Because, as their pastor said, we felt that looking at the cross was oppressive and traumatizing
[3339.86 --> 3343.46]  to our progressive worldviews.
[3344.78 --> 3345.34]  Right?
[3345.34 --> 3351.14]  The theology of the cross for this church was modern child abuse.
[3351.72 --> 3351.80]  Right?
[3351.86 --> 3353.44]  It represented the patriarchy.
[3353.96 --> 3359.66]  And the horror of the cross was embarrassing to them, and so they turned their chairs away
[3359.66 --> 3361.22]  from it, so they didn't have to look at it.
[3362.44 --> 3366.04]  Now, you might ask the question, why wouldn't they just take the cross down?
[3366.04 --> 3371.64]  And the answer is because that church, being old and beautiful, is used in the film industry,
[3371.80 --> 3375.82]  and it's rented out all the time, and they make pretty good money, and taking the cross
[3375.82 --> 3378.44]  down, it wouldn't look like a church anymore, so they wouldn't be making that money.
[3378.54 --> 3380.48]  So instead, they turned the chairs.
[3381.96 --> 3386.26]  That's a picture of being ashamed of the gospel.
[3389.70 --> 3394.96]  But it's also not only that sort of progressive liberalism, right?
[3394.96 --> 3400.54]  There are other ways that people are ashamed of the gospel, because obviously, progressive
[3400.54 --> 3402.54]  liberalism wasn't the issue in Paul's day.
[3404.26 --> 3408.24]  And so what else might make people ashamed of the gospel?
[3410.02 --> 3418.56]  The word that Paul uses here, translated ashamed in our Bibles, can also mean, in Greek,
[3419.16 --> 3421.74]  offended or embarrassed.
[3421.74 --> 3422.96]  Right?
[3423.00 --> 3428.30]  And so in the same way that the church was offended by the gospel with the cross, there are other
[3428.30 --> 3430.94]  ways that the gospel is offensive.
[3432.70 --> 3438.08]  In 1 Corinthians, Paul says that the gospel is foolishness and a stumbling block.
[3438.16 --> 3441.26]  And he writes in chapter 1, verse 27,
[3442.26 --> 3445.78]  God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise.
[3446.14 --> 3449.56]  He chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong.
[3449.56 --> 3457.34]  Point is, there is something about the full and true gospel of Jesus that is going to be
[3457.34 --> 3465.82]  counterintuitive to the world and that will offend our, quote, religious senses.
[3467.76 --> 3468.60]  And here's the thing, right?
[3468.60 --> 3480.68]  In Paul's day, in pagan Rome, people had very clear expectations of how gods worked and how humans
[3480.68 --> 3482.30]  were supposed to interact with them.
[3483.12 --> 3489.76]  And so, for instance, a week before harvest time, you brought a sacrifice to the temple to appease the
[3489.76 --> 3493.48]  god and in return, she would give you a bumper crop.
[3493.48 --> 3494.04]  Right?
[3495.26 --> 3502.62]  If you wanted to start a new business in a new city, you went to the patron god of that city to their temple
[3502.62 --> 3504.74]  in the city and you made an offering.
[3505.64 --> 3512.60]  And then the god would open up the city and the way of the city's dealings to you to make your business successful.
[3513.50 --> 3513.72]  Right?
[3513.76 --> 3514.56]  On and on it goes.
[3514.82 --> 3516.56]  The formula was simple.
[3516.56 --> 3521.80]  You do this for the god, they will do that for you.
[3522.72 --> 3523.02]  Right?
[3523.08 --> 3528.20]  It's transactional and really it was understood by everyone in society.
[3529.32 --> 3535.56]  In fact, in the fourth century, so fast forward some 400 years from when this letter was written,
[3535.56 --> 3541.14]  the power and the strength of the Roman Empire has started waning.
[3542.10 --> 3548.14]  The Goths from the Germanic area of Europe, what we know as Europe, have started coming down.
[3548.22 --> 3550.98]  The Huns from the east have started coming in.
[3551.06 --> 3556.48]  They're fighting their way through the northern cities in Italy and they're making their way to Rome.
[3556.60 --> 3558.96]  Eventually, they will come to Rome to sack Rome.
[3558.96 --> 3561.92]  This is the sort of beginning of the end of the Roman Empire.
[3561.92 --> 3568.96]  When this is taking place, there is a movement from people, citizens of the Roman Empire,
[3569.26 --> 3576.48]  that rises up blaming Christians and Christianity for this happening to the city
[3576.48 --> 3580.86]  because the influence of Christianity had grown so much by this time
[3580.86 --> 3587.10]  that it had limited the offering of sacrifices and worship to the traditional Roman gods.
[3588.16 --> 3591.42]  The argument was because we've stopped worshipping these gods,
[3591.42 --> 3595.02]  because we've stopped paying sacrifice to them or giving offering to them,
[3595.32 --> 3598.90]  the gods have stopped protecting our great city and our empire.
[3599.64 --> 3604.26]  And in order to stop that from happening, we need to start worshipping these gods again.
[3605.26 --> 3607.74]  In part, for you history buffs,
[3608.88 --> 3611.80]  Augustine, who's a fourth century church father from North Africa,
[3612.24 --> 3616.70]  his amazing book, The City of God, is written in response to that,
[3616.78 --> 3619.62]  in defense of Christians during this attack.
[3619.62 --> 3629.70]  But part of why the gospel is offensive is because it flies in the face of this transactional approach to God.
[3630.74 --> 3634.12]  The normal religious model, and this continues to today,
[3634.58 --> 3638.98]  is do this and God or the gods will reward you.
[3639.98 --> 3646.04]  That way and understanding of God or gods makes sense to people.
[3646.04 --> 3648.04]  Right?
[3648.04 --> 3648.34]  Right?
[3648.42 --> 3650.08]  It's a system of debit and credit.
[3651.82 --> 3655.30]  But the gospel is the opposite of that.
[3656.22 --> 3662.50]  The gospel of Jesus and the truth of his word says that we are such spiritual failures
[3662.50 --> 3665.14]  that even our best efforts are filthy rags.
[3666.18 --> 3671.64]  That everything we do is sinful and that there's nothing we can do to earn God's favor.
[3671.64 --> 3676.00]  Instead, the gospel of Jesus says God did everything.
[3677.28 --> 3681.52]  So while there's nothing we can do, God does it all on our behalf.
[3681.72 --> 3686.00]  And that doesn't make sense to the religious frame of Paul's day.
[3687.00 --> 3688.86]  In fact, it hardly makes sense to us.
[3690.44 --> 3690.62]  Right?
[3690.68 --> 3695.12]  We want to believe that we are genuinely and generally good.
[3695.12 --> 3698.66]  And that we should have a say in our eternal destiny.
[3699.66 --> 3703.86]  But the truth of Jesus, the truth of the gospel from John 6 says,
[3704.34 --> 3708.46]  No one comes to me unless the Father draws him.
[3709.76 --> 3713.26]  The gospel is offensive because we don't like to lose our autonomy.
[3714.92 --> 3720.30]  So many of us continue to think that being moral or being religious
[3720.30 --> 3723.42]  will give us an advantage when it comes to God.
[3724.10 --> 3728.08]  Or at least, we think, it will make us better off
[3728.08 --> 3731.18]  than those people who are less moral or less religious.
[3732.70 --> 3734.84]  But the truth of Jesus says,
[3735.36 --> 3738.82]  For it is by grace you have been saved through faith.
[3739.16 --> 3740.56]  And this is not from yourselves.
[3740.56 --> 3744.92]  It is the gift of God, not by works so that no one can post.
[3744.92 --> 3756.42]  In Paul's day, people worshipped a whole plethora or pantheon of gods.
[3756.68 --> 3756.82]  Right?
[3756.84 --> 3759.88]  Not only depending on what you needed in return from them,
[3760.04 --> 3763.12]  but also, like, on the location of where you were.
[3764.14 --> 3764.32]  Right?
[3764.38 --> 3769.12]  A city or a region had a god associated with it.
[3769.30 --> 3771.00]  And then when you came to that city,
[3771.40 --> 3772.78]  you would sacrifice to that god.
[3773.46 --> 3773.98]  Right?
[3773.98 --> 3778.06]  Different guilds and community groups had particular gods
[3778.06 --> 3780.14]  and had particular religious traditions.
[3780.72 --> 3783.78]  And as you changed guilds or as you moved about,
[3784.14 --> 3787.48]  you kind of just added one in and maybe you rotated one out,
[3787.58 --> 3788.78]  but you didn't really have to.
[3789.34 --> 3789.54]  Right?
[3789.64 --> 3790.92]  And on and on it went.
[3791.02 --> 3792.60]  You kept one if you liked it,
[3792.60 --> 3794.14]  and then you took on another one,
[3794.20 --> 3796.38]  depending on the circumstance you find yourself in.
[3796.80 --> 3799.34]  The point is, in the Roman world,
[3800.20 --> 3802.80]  it's not a big deal to just add one more.
[3802.80 --> 3806.32]  It doesn't matter to just throw in another one.
[3807.44 --> 3812.38]  And that's why, again, it was so offensive for the early church to come along
[3812.38 --> 3815.62]  and before them for the Jews to come along and say,
[3815.74 --> 3816.00]  no!
[3817.16 --> 3817.34]  Right?
[3817.38 --> 3819.78]  You can only worship Jesus.
[3819.78 --> 3821.56]  When the early church said,
[3821.56 --> 3825.08]  there is one God and Father who has made himself known in the Son,
[3825.46 --> 3827.80]  who remains with us in power through the Holy Spirit,
[3828.16 --> 3830.62]  his glory he will not yield to another,
[3831.00 --> 3835.72]  it doesn't make sense to the religious worldview of the empire.
[3837.20 --> 3841.00]  People are offended because it doesn't add up.
[3841.42 --> 3843.96]  People are always offended by what they don't understand.
[3843.96 --> 3847.36]  But again, the gospel of Jesus says,
[3847.72 --> 3849.96]  salvation is found in no one else,
[3850.06 --> 3853.70]  for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind
[3853.70 --> 3856.80]  by which we must be saved.
[3857.48 --> 3859.20]  Acts 4, 12.
[3860.54 --> 3864.20]  The exclusivity of Jesus
[3864.20 --> 3868.86]  and the exclusivity of Christian salvation
[3868.86 --> 3872.80]  is unfathomable in Paul's day.
[3875.20 --> 3877.50]  The exclusivity of the Christian gospel
[3877.50 --> 3881.16]  continues to be offensive in our culture.
[3882.20 --> 3882.72]  Right?
[3882.82 --> 3884.34]  People say things like,
[3885.10 --> 3887.52]  sure, Christianity works for you,
[3887.64 --> 3889.38]  and I'm glad that it works for you,
[3889.38 --> 3890.64]  but it's just not for me.
[3891.78 --> 3891.90]  Right?
[3892.02 --> 3894.82]  I don't need Christianity to be a good person.
[3895.98 --> 3898.24]  Now, first off, notice when people say that,
[3898.56 --> 3901.04]  right, notice how the idea of being a good person
[3901.04 --> 3902.50]  is what really matters to them.
[3902.56 --> 3904.92]  That's what elevates, right?
[3905.00 --> 3907.78]  The real assumption is that the point of religion
[3907.78 --> 3910.04]  or the gospel is about being a good person
[3910.04 --> 3910.98]  when in fact,
[3911.22 --> 3913.10]  what I hope we can see and agree on
[3913.10 --> 3915.00]  that the point of religion,
[3915.22 --> 3916.10]  properly understood,
[3916.42 --> 3917.92]  is communion with God.
[3917.92 --> 3919.16]  Right?
[3919.20 --> 3920.18]  Is glorifying him.
[3921.46 --> 3922.72]  But also, right,
[3922.78 --> 3924.14]  there's an assumption in there
[3924.14 --> 3927.56]  that whatever works is equally valid.
[3928.96 --> 3932.18]  There's this idea that exists
[3932.18 --> 3935.58]  that all religions are fundamentally the same.
[3936.18 --> 3937.14]  And that in the end,
[3937.26 --> 3940.14]  we all worship the same ultimate reality,
[3940.90 --> 3942.70]  whatever name you call it,
[3943.26 --> 3944.90]  him, or her by.
[3944.90 --> 3946.94]  And then,
[3947.58 --> 3948.62]  there's a switch
[3948.62 --> 3950.12]  that takes place.
[3950.18 --> 3951.68]  People who make this argument say
[3951.68 --> 3953.16]  that what matters
[3953.16 --> 3955.42]  is the authenticity
[3955.42 --> 3957.20]  of your devotion.
[3958.34 --> 3958.86]  Right?
[3958.92 --> 3960.66]  As long as you really believe
[3960.66 --> 3962.52]  what you say you believe,
[3962.82 --> 3964.04]  that's what matters.
[3964.14 --> 3965.04]  That's what's important.
[3965.50 --> 3966.68]  If there is a judgment,
[3966.88 --> 3967.86]  it will be based on
[3967.86 --> 3969.10]  the authenticity
[3969.10 --> 3970.52]  of your belief,
[3970.62 --> 3971.40]  the strength
[3971.40 --> 3972.60]  of what you believe.
[3972.60 --> 3974.16]  Now,
[3974.80 --> 3975.90]  we could get really technical
[3975.90 --> 3977.48]  and philosophical here,
[3977.60 --> 3978.92]  but I've noticed
[3978.92 --> 3979.58]  that there are,
[3980.04 --> 3980.80]  generally speaking,
[3981.58 --> 3982.30]  and I'm happy
[3982.30 --> 3983.34]  if you want to talk to me after,
[3983.44 --> 3984.28]  you can challenge me on this,
[3984.34 --> 3985.12]  but there are,
[3985.20 --> 3986.00]  generally speaking,
[3986.48 --> 3988.82]  two sorts of people
[3988.82 --> 3990.06]  in today's world
[3990.06 --> 3992.00]  who will make this claim.
[3992.50 --> 3992.68]  Right?
[3992.74 --> 3994.74]  That all religions
[3994.74 --> 3996.58]  are fundamentally the same,
[3996.58 --> 3998.08]  and what matters
[3998.08 --> 3998.76]  is devotion.
[3999.66 --> 4000.22]  The one
[4000.22 --> 4001.32]  who will do that
[4001.32 --> 4002.98]  is a secular agnostic.
[4003.46 --> 4003.58]  Right?
[4003.66 --> 4003.80]  So,
[4004.20 --> 4005.76]  secular being
[4005.76 --> 4007.32]  someone who
[4007.32 --> 4008.42]  generally follows
[4008.42 --> 4009.64]  sort of a humanistic
[4009.64 --> 4010.42]  tradition.
[4010.70 --> 4010.86]  Right?
[4010.86 --> 4012.52]  And agnostic
[4012.52 --> 4013.42]  being someone
[4013.42 --> 4014.36]  who is unable
[4014.36 --> 4015.26]  or unwilling
[4015.26 --> 4016.92]  to make any claims
[4016.92 --> 4017.90]  or definitive claims
[4017.90 --> 4019.04]  about who God is.
[4020.04 --> 4020.58]  Right?
[4020.66 --> 4020.76]  So,
[4020.84 --> 4022.32]  the humanistic aspect
[4022.32 --> 4022.88]  is that
[4022.88 --> 4024.00]  the idea that people
[4024.00 --> 4025.08]  are basically good,
[4025.08 --> 4026.58]  that we all deserve
[4026.58 --> 4027.72]  a fair shake,
[4027.82 --> 4028.46]  and that history
[4028.46 --> 4029.52]  generally marches
[4029.52 --> 4031.14]  towards progress,
[4031.64 --> 4032.38]  the idea that
[4032.38 --> 4033.66]  what's next is best
[4033.66 --> 4035.04]  sort of fits that tenet.
[4036.60 --> 4037.12]  So,
[4037.24 --> 4038.36]  those people,
[4038.60 --> 4039.18]  sort of secular,
[4039.36 --> 4040.42]  humanistic agnostics,
[4040.50 --> 4041.46]  they will say something
[4041.46 --> 4042.02]  like that
[4042.02 --> 4042.76]  in the modern world,
[4043.18 --> 4043.80]  but you know
[4043.80 --> 4044.48]  who doesn't
[4044.48 --> 4045.70]  say that?
[4046.36 --> 4047.04]  You know who doesn't
[4047.04 --> 4047.88]  say all religions
[4047.88 --> 4048.42]  are the same?
[4050.02 --> 4050.98]  All people
[4050.98 --> 4051.78]  who believe
[4051.78 --> 4052.44]  those religions.
[4054.12 --> 4054.26]  Right?
[4054.26 --> 4055.64]  Every traditional Muslim
[4055.64 --> 4056.72]  that I've talked to
[4056.72 --> 4058.14]  refuses to say
[4058.14 --> 4059.38]  that Islam and Christianity
[4059.38 --> 4060.50]  are basically
[4060.50 --> 4061.14]  the same thing.
[4062.60 --> 4064.12]  Every practicing Hindu
[4064.12 --> 4065.68]  that I've ever talked to
[4065.68 --> 4068.30]  fundamentally believes
[4068.30 --> 4069.06]  that we are different
[4069.06 --> 4069.72]  when we talk about
[4069.72 --> 4070.38]  who God is
[4070.38 --> 4072.36]  and how history works,
[4072.62 --> 4073.10]  for example.
[4073.68 --> 4074.64]  In Christianity,
[4075.18 --> 4076.62]  history is linear.
[4077.50 --> 4077.60]  Now,
[4077.60 --> 4078.24]  that's not to say
[4078.24 --> 4079.46]  that people
[4079.46 --> 4080.28]  who don't know history
[4080.28 --> 4080.76]  aren't doomed
[4080.76 --> 4081.34]  to repeat it
[4081.34 --> 4082.04]  and that things
[4082.04 --> 4083.04]  happen in patterns,
[4083.04 --> 4084.22]  but generally speaking,
[4084.30 --> 4084.96]  there is a beginning.
[4085.52 --> 4085.66]  Right?
[4085.74 --> 4087.20]  We read in the beginning,
[4087.34 --> 4088.04]  God created,
[4088.16 --> 4088.86]  the heavens and the earth,
[4088.96 --> 4090.44]  and there is an end.
[4090.92 --> 4091.26]  Behold,
[4091.36 --> 4092.66]  I am making all things new.
[4093.10 --> 4093.26]  Right?
[4093.28 --> 4093.72]  In Christianity,
[4094.08 --> 4095.26]  history is linear.
[4095.64 --> 4096.46]  In Hinduism,
[4096.70 --> 4098.22]  history and all reality
[4098.22 --> 4099.84]  moves through
[4099.84 --> 4102.50]  spirals of four
[4102.50 --> 4104.00]  yugas
[4104.00 --> 4105.74]  that are infinitely repeating.
[4105.74 --> 4109.76]  the point is,
[4110.18 --> 4110.92]  in my experience,
[4111.36 --> 4112.20]  that traditional
[4112.20 --> 4113.06]  practicers
[4113.06 --> 4114.62]  of the world's religion,
[4115.14 --> 4115.96]  world's religions
[4115.96 --> 4116.82]  don't believe
[4116.82 --> 4117.74]  that all religions
[4117.74 --> 4118.88]  are the same.
[4120.06 --> 4121.22]  But as I said,
[4121.94 --> 4122.82]  there's two groups
[4122.82 --> 4123.36]  of people
[4123.36 --> 4124.20]  who do,
[4124.28 --> 4125.56]  the secular humanist
[4125.56 --> 4126.48]  agnostics
[4126.48 --> 4128.22]  and the only other group
[4128.22 --> 4128.58]  of people
[4128.58 --> 4129.76]  I've heard make this claim
[4129.76 --> 4131.72]  are progressive
[4131.72 --> 4133.04]  Christians.
[4133.04 --> 4137.44]  Some of you
[4137.44 --> 4139.26]  are going to be offended
[4139.26 --> 4140.02]  by me right now.
[4140.90 --> 4141.90]  I'm aware of that.
[4142.50 --> 4143.24]  I'm happy to talk.
[4143.56 --> 4144.54]  I will be at the table
[4144.54 --> 4144.98]  at the back.
[4145.90 --> 4146.88]  Let's have that conversation.
[4148.56 --> 4149.74]  But so many
[4149.74 --> 4151.16]  progressive Christians
[4151.16 --> 4152.70]  operate in the world
[4152.70 --> 4154.70]  with the religious
[4154.70 --> 4156.26]  and moral sense
[4156.26 --> 4157.36]  that seems
[4157.36 --> 4159.04]  eerily similar
[4159.04 --> 4160.92]  to the paganism
[4160.92 --> 4161.74]  of Paul's day.
[4163.04 --> 4165.34]  The Protestant liberalism
[4165.34 --> 4166.60]  of the 19th century
[4166.60 --> 4167.36]  has become
[4167.36 --> 4168.66]  a Protestant paganism
[4168.66 --> 4170.14]  in the 21st century.
[4171.40 --> 4172.50]  But again,
[4173.16 --> 4174.50]  the gospel of Jesus
[4174.50 --> 4176.56]  flies in the face
[4176.56 --> 4178.14]  of this idea
[4178.14 --> 4179.36]  of absolute
[4179.36 --> 4180.38]  autonomous religious
[4180.38 --> 4181.38]  pluralism.
[4181.90 --> 4183.02]  Jesus says,
[4183.44 --> 4184.40]  I am the way,
[4184.54 --> 4184.96]  the truth,
[4185.00 --> 4185.50]  and the life.
[4185.66 --> 4186.48]  No one comes
[4186.48 --> 4187.04]  to the Father
[4187.04 --> 4188.90]  except through me.
[4189.90 --> 4191.48]  Now that cannot be true
[4191.48 --> 4193.12]  if it is also true
[4193.12 --> 4193.78]  that anyone
[4193.78 --> 4195.02]  can come to the Father
[4195.02 --> 4196.32]  or whatever you call
[4196.32 --> 4197.20]  ultimate reality
[4197.20 --> 4198.60]  through deep devotion.
[4200.56 --> 4202.42]  In the terms of logic,
[4202.64 --> 4203.48]  and this goes all the way
[4203.48 --> 4204.28]  back to Aristotle
[4204.28 --> 4204.84]  and before,
[4205.74 --> 4206.28]  this is called
[4206.28 --> 4208.16]  the law of the excluded middle.
[4209.12 --> 4209.90]  And so for instance,
[4210.10 --> 4210.98]  in 1 John,
[4211.28 --> 4211.88]  we read,
[4212.48 --> 4213.52]  whoever has the Son
[4213.52 --> 4214.24]  has life.
[4214.70 --> 4215.66]  Whoever does not have
[4215.66 --> 4216.36]  the Son of God
[4216.36 --> 4217.40]  does not have life.
[4217.40 --> 4219.24]  That's either true
[4219.24 --> 4220.74]  or it's not.
[4222.26 --> 4224.44]  The idea of religious pluralism
[4224.44 --> 4225.50]  and relativism
[4225.50 --> 4225.80]  says,
[4226.00 --> 4226.24]  yes,
[4226.50 --> 4227.38]  that's true.
[4227.72 --> 4228.64]  Whoever does not have
[4228.64 --> 4229.26]  the Son of God
[4229.26 --> 4230.18]  does not have life.
[4230.44 --> 4232.32]  And it's also true
[4232.32 --> 4233.40]  that even if you don't
[4233.40 --> 4234.12]  have the Son of God,
[4234.20 --> 4234.96]  you still have life.
[4235.96 --> 4237.50]  Both can't be true.
[4238.58 --> 4241.20]  The one denies
[4241.20 --> 4242.24]  the possibility
[4242.24 --> 4243.70]  of the other.
[4243.70 --> 4245.54]  And yet,
[4245.86 --> 4247.74]  in our world today,
[4247.88 --> 4248.84]  so many people
[4248.84 --> 4249.82]  go around
[4249.82 --> 4250.70]  saying both
[4250.70 --> 4251.62]  are true.
[4252.46 --> 4253.64]  But they can't be.
[4255.28 --> 4256.86]  It doesn't work like that.
[4258.92 --> 4259.34]  And look,
[4260.06 --> 4261.66]  the reality here
[4261.66 --> 4262.16]  is that
[4262.16 --> 4263.24]  we,
[4263.56 --> 4264.38]  you and I,
[4264.54 --> 4265.90]  can't just sit
[4265.90 --> 4267.50]  passively back
[4267.50 --> 4268.06]  and pretend
[4268.06 --> 4269.02]  that this way
[4269.02 --> 4269.42]  of thinking
[4269.42 --> 4270.12]  about the gospel
[4270.12 --> 4270.74]  is okay.
[4272.06 --> 4272.26]  Right?
[4272.26 --> 4272.58]  Yes,
[4272.72 --> 4273.28]  the gospel
[4273.28 --> 4274.72]  is offensive
[4274.72 --> 4276.70]  and you might
[4276.70 --> 4277.68]  have to be willing
[4277.68 --> 4279.18]  to offend some people
[4279.18 --> 4280.10]  if you want them
[4280.10 --> 4280.70]  to be saved
[4280.70 --> 4281.42]  by the gospel.
[4282.62 --> 4283.16]  Now,
[4283.22 --> 4283.62]  I know,
[4283.84 --> 4285.06]  I know
[4285.06 --> 4287.04]  that sometimes
[4287.04 --> 4289.34]  offending people
[4289.34 --> 4291.36]  in our day and age
[4291.36 --> 4292.44]  of political correctness
[4292.44 --> 4292.86]  and the like,
[4292.98 --> 4293.68]  offending people
[4293.68 --> 4294.60]  is equated
[4294.60 --> 4295.80]  with violence
[4295.80 --> 4296.54]  against them.
[4298.16 --> 4298.26]  Now,
[4298.26 --> 4298.98]  can I just say
[4298.98 --> 4300.52]  that knocking down
[4300.52 --> 4301.44]  a bad idea
[4301.44 --> 4302.56]  is not the same
[4302.56 --> 4303.34]  as knocking down
[4303.34 --> 4303.76]  a person.
[4305.44 --> 4305.58]  Right?
[4306.04 --> 4306.52]  Disagreeing,
[4306.78 --> 4307.36]  especially
[4307.36 --> 4308.86]  when we do it
[4308.86 --> 4309.40]  the way the Bible
[4309.40 --> 4310.22]  tells us to,
[4310.42 --> 4310.60]  right?
[4310.74 --> 4311.22]  Disagreeing
[4311.22 --> 4311.88]  with gentleness
[4311.88 --> 4312.82]  and respect
[4312.82 --> 4314.64]  is not an attack
[4314.64 --> 4315.68]  on a person's
[4315.68 --> 4316.32]  self
[4316.32 --> 4317.32]  or value.
[4319.40 --> 4320.40]  But can I also
[4320.40 --> 4321.00]  just say
[4321.00 --> 4324.16]  the gospel
[4324.16 --> 4324.80]  is offensive
[4324.80 --> 4325.72]  enough on its own.
[4325.72 --> 4328.30]  You don't need
[4328.30 --> 4328.88]  to be a jerk
[4328.88 --> 4329.60]  on top of that.
[4331.62 --> 4332.10]  Right?
[4332.12 --> 4333.04]  I don't ever want
[4333.04 --> 4333.46]  someone
[4333.46 --> 4334.50]  to say
[4334.50 --> 4335.22]  that they don't
[4335.22 --> 4336.16]  believe the gospel
[4336.16 --> 4337.00]  because of something
[4337.00 --> 4337.94]  I said or did.
[4338.50 --> 4339.22]  Because of some
[4339.22 --> 4340.34]  attitude that I had.
[4341.10 --> 4341.24]  Right?
[4341.28 --> 4341.98]  Your love
[4341.98 --> 4342.88]  and your serving
[4342.88 --> 4344.18]  and your sacrificing
[4344.18 --> 4345.42]  for those who
[4345.42 --> 4346.16]  look down
[4346.16 --> 4346.76]  on your faith
[4346.76 --> 4347.26]  or for those
[4347.26 --> 4348.36]  who don't agree
[4348.36 --> 4349.98]  with what you believe.
[4350.32 --> 4350.44]  Right?
[4350.56 --> 4351.20]  Those doing
[4351.20 --> 4352.12]  that sort of thing
[4352.12 --> 4353.26]  either makes
[4353.26 --> 4354.34]  the gospel of Jesus
[4354.34 --> 4355.38]  more compelling
[4355.38 --> 4358.04]  or like Proverbs 25
[4358.04 --> 4358.62]  says,
[4359.22 --> 4360.90]  you heap coals
[4360.90 --> 4361.82]  on their head
[4361.82 --> 4363.08]  and God might
[4363.08 --> 4363.66]  move them
[4363.66 --> 4364.78]  to repent.
[4365.86 --> 4367.22]  But the risk
[4367.22 --> 4368.78]  is worth it.
[4369.74 --> 4369.82]  Right?
[4369.86 --> 4371.10]  The offense
[4371.10 --> 4372.58]  is necessary
[4372.58 --> 4373.76]  not just for them
[4373.76 --> 4374.34]  to believe
[4374.34 --> 4375.36]  and to be saved
[4375.36 --> 4376.84]  but also for you.
[4379.16 --> 4380.54]  I can't know
[4380.54 --> 4381.50]  this for sure
[4381.50 --> 4383.10]  but I think
[4383.10 --> 4384.10]  that when Paul says
[4384.10 --> 4385.06]  I'm not ashamed
[4385.06 --> 4385.78]  of the gospel
[4385.78 --> 4387.36]  he has in mind
[4387.36 --> 4388.28]  particular words
[4388.28 --> 4388.68]  of Jesus
[4388.68 --> 4389.88]  and even if he doesn't
[4389.88 --> 4391.48]  the way these two
[4391.48 --> 4393.28]  texts relate
[4393.28 --> 4394.04]  is important
[4394.04 --> 4394.86]  for us to see.
[4395.42 --> 4396.36]  In Mark 8
[4396.36 --> 4398.14]  Jesus says
[4398.14 --> 4400.06]  if anyone
[4400.06 --> 4400.86]  is ashamed
[4400.86 --> 4401.54]  of me
[4401.54 --> 4402.84]  and my words
[4402.84 --> 4404.08]  in this adulterous
[4404.08 --> 4405.30]  and sinful generation
[4405.30 --> 4406.90]  the son of man
[4406.90 --> 4407.86]  will be ashamed
[4407.86 --> 4408.50]  of them
[4408.50 --> 4409.50]  when he comes
[4409.50 --> 4411.28]  in his father's glory
[4411.28 --> 4413.04]  with the holy angels.
[4413.04 --> 4416.94]  and so I mean
[4416.94 --> 4419.32]  if the choice
[4419.32 --> 4420.74]  is offending
[4420.74 --> 4421.64]  some people
[4421.64 --> 4422.46]  down here
[4422.46 --> 4423.40]  or Jesus
[4423.40 --> 4424.26]  being ashamed
[4424.26 --> 4424.64]  of me
[4424.64 --> 4425.36]  when he comes
[4425.36 --> 4426.44]  I want to side
[4426.44 --> 4427.00]  with Jesus
[4427.00 --> 4428.12]  every time.
[4435.62 --> 4436.60]  Or do I?
[4436.60 --> 4442.22]  because even
[4442.22 --> 4442.80]  as I say
[4442.80 --> 4443.14]  that
[4443.14 --> 4446.44]  there's a part
[4446.44 --> 4446.82]  of me
[4446.82 --> 4449.36]  that wonders.
[4452.24 --> 4452.68]  Right?
[4452.70 --> 4452.96]  If I'm
[4452.96 --> 4454.40]  absolutely honest
[4454.40 --> 4455.38]  with you
[4455.38 --> 4457.62]  there's a part
[4457.62 --> 4457.82]  of me
[4457.82 --> 4458.70]  that questions
[4458.70 --> 4461.44]  whether I really
[4461.44 --> 4461.86]  do
[4461.86 --> 4463.20]  want to side
[4463.20 --> 4463.70]  with Jesus
[4463.70 --> 4465.32]  every time.
[4466.28 --> 4466.94]  Because you see
[4466.94 --> 4467.92]  there's a part
[4467.92 --> 4468.50]  of what Paul
[4468.50 --> 4469.12]  means here
[4469.12 --> 4469.58]  when he says
[4469.58 --> 4470.16]  that he's not
[4470.16 --> 4471.18]  ashamed of the gospel
[4471.18 --> 4472.38]  that includes
[4472.38 --> 4473.62]  being embarrassed
[4473.62 --> 4475.14]  by the gospel.
[4476.30 --> 4477.38]  And then I start
[4477.38 --> 4477.96]  to think
[4477.96 --> 4479.56]  how many times
[4479.56 --> 4481.86]  how many times
[4481.86 --> 4482.88]  have I chosen
[4482.88 --> 4484.22]  to not
[4484.22 --> 4485.42]  share the gospel?
[4485.80 --> 4486.58]  How many times
[4486.58 --> 4487.40]  have I chosen
[4487.40 --> 4488.70]  to avoid
[4488.70 --> 4489.62]  a particular
[4489.62 --> 4491.18]  avenue of conversation
[4491.18 --> 4492.24]  with someone?
[4492.40 --> 4493.54]  To avoid
[4493.54 --> 4494.62]  bringing a word
[4494.62 --> 4495.96]  from Jesus
[4495.96 --> 4497.22]  or from the Bible
[4497.22 --> 4498.56]  into a conversation
[4498.56 --> 4500.30]  because I'm
[4500.30 --> 4501.72]  too worried
[4501.72 --> 4502.40]  about what
[4502.40 --> 4502.98]  the other person
[4502.98 --> 4503.50]  might think.
[4506.26 --> 4507.58]  And I know
[4507.58 --> 4508.40]  that I'm not
[4508.40 --> 4509.60]  alone in this.
[4510.12 --> 4510.20]  Right?
[4510.26 --> 4511.40]  Sometimes we worry
[4511.40 --> 4512.04]  more about
[4512.04 --> 4512.86]  what the other person
[4512.86 --> 4513.74]  will say
[4513.74 --> 4514.44]  or how they might
[4514.44 --> 4514.88]  respond
[4514.88 --> 4515.62]  than we do
[4515.62 --> 4516.96]  about the faithfulness
[4516.96 --> 4518.52]  of our response
[4518.52 --> 4519.06]  to the call
[4519.06 --> 4519.60]  of the gospel
[4519.60 --> 4520.42]  to declare
[4520.42 --> 4521.68]  and to preach
[4521.68 --> 4522.26]  the good news.
[4523.46 --> 4524.66]  And for those of us
[4524.66 --> 4525.28]  who are gathered
[4525.28 --> 4526.12]  here this morning
[4526.12 --> 4527.66]  this is probably
[4527.66 --> 4528.28]  the idea
[4528.28 --> 4529.56]  that hits most closely
[4529.56 --> 4531.20]  to our own practice
[4531.20 --> 4532.36]  and activity together.
[4533.56 --> 4534.60]  In the particular
[4534.60 --> 4535.58]  cultural climate
[4535.58 --> 4536.28]  of today
[4536.28 --> 4537.62]  it's easier
[4537.62 --> 4538.84]  to believe
[4538.84 --> 4539.86]  the lie
[4539.86 --> 4541.08]  that your religion
[4541.08 --> 4542.26]  your faith
[4542.26 --> 4543.38]  belongs
[4543.38 --> 4544.52]  in the private
[4544.52 --> 4545.66]  sphere alone.
[4546.34 --> 4547.08]  That it's something
[4547.08 --> 4548.36]  personal to you
[4548.36 --> 4549.34]  and it shouldn't
[4549.34 --> 4549.84]  affect
[4549.84 --> 4550.96]  or be shared
[4550.96 --> 4551.94]  with other people.
[4552.98 --> 4553.52]  Right?
[4553.58 --> 4554.66]  That evangelism
[4554.66 --> 4555.66]  and conversion
[4555.66 --> 4556.78]  or the belief
[4556.78 --> 4557.88]  in the importance
[4557.88 --> 4558.86]  and the necessity
[4558.86 --> 4559.90]  of conversion
[4559.90 --> 4560.80]  is somehow
[4560.80 --> 4562.06]  a violence
[4562.06 --> 4563.18]  against the autonomy
[4563.18 --> 4564.44]  of another person.
[4565.44 --> 4566.70]  We buy into that.
[4569.12 --> 4570.74]  So then we stay quiet.
[4571.74 --> 4573.06]  Even when God
[4573.06 --> 4574.24]  seems to be giving us
[4574.24 --> 4575.54]  a really clear opportunity
[4575.54 --> 4577.42]  we don't take it.
[4577.42 --> 4582.22]  just the other day
[4582.22 --> 4583.50]  I was talking
[4583.50 --> 4584.44]  with one of the parents
[4584.44 --> 4585.42]  from my son's
[4585.42 --> 4586.12]  soccer team
[4586.12 --> 4588.36]  and he asked me
[4588.36 --> 4589.56]  like randomly
[4589.56 --> 4590.22]  we weren't
[4590.22 --> 4591.28]  in a conversation
[4591.28 --> 4592.14]  like this at all
[4592.14 --> 4593.18]  we had watched
[4593.18 --> 4594.18]  the kids for a few minutes
[4594.18 --> 4594.92]  and our conversation
[4594.92 --> 4595.74]  sort of petered out
[4595.74 --> 4596.54]  and he turned to me
[4596.54 --> 4597.62]  and seemingly
[4597.62 --> 4598.50]  out of the blue
[4598.50 --> 4599.20]  he said
[4599.20 --> 4600.52]  does your church
[4600.52 --> 4601.76]  do any outdoor services?
[4601.76 --> 4605.26]  and my first thought
[4605.26 --> 4606.70]  as soon as he said that
[4606.70 --> 4607.00]  was
[4607.00 --> 4608.18]  oh
[4608.18 --> 4609.70]  I don't want to talk
[4609.70 --> 4610.84]  about church right now
[4610.84 --> 4612.88]  that's work
[4612.88 --> 4614.64]  I'm here to watch
[4614.64 --> 4615.64]  my son play soccer
[4615.64 --> 4617.88]  and he had pretty much
[4617.88 --> 4618.80]  opened the door
[4618.80 --> 4619.40]  for me
[4619.40 --> 4620.80]  to talk to him
[4620.80 --> 4621.38]  about Jesus
[4621.38 --> 4622.30]  and about the gospel
[4622.30 --> 4623.22]  and about the importance
[4623.22 --> 4624.14]  of worshiping him
[4624.14 --> 4625.38]  and about how we gather
[4625.38 --> 4625.90]  together
[4625.90 --> 4626.82]  as a body
[4626.82 --> 4627.48]  and a family
[4627.48 --> 4628.28]  to do that
[4628.28 --> 4629.44]  he had opened the door
[4629.44 --> 4630.48]  all I had to do
[4630.48 --> 4631.86]  was walk right through it
[4631.86 --> 4633.80]  and my first response was
[4633.80 --> 4635.32]  yeah I'm not really
[4635.32 --> 4635.90]  in the mood for that
[4635.90 --> 4636.50]  right now bro
[4636.50 --> 4639.74]  no
[4639.74 --> 4642.08]  in my own head
[4642.08 --> 4642.50]  then
[4642.50 --> 4644.86]  I began to justify it
[4644.86 --> 4645.78]  right
[4645.78 --> 4646.04]  it's like
[4646.04 --> 4646.52]  you know what
[4646.52 --> 4646.82]  like
[4646.82 --> 4650.50]  after soccer season's over
[4650.50 --> 4651.02]  I'll probably never
[4651.02 --> 4651.80]  see this guy again
[4651.80 --> 4653.22]  I don't need to worry
[4653.22 --> 4653.74]  about that
[4653.74 --> 4654.94]  I don't need to have
[4654.94 --> 4655.64]  this conversation
[4655.64 --> 4656.18]  right now
[4656.18 --> 4657.12]  he doesn't want to hear
[4657.12 --> 4658.06]  about those things
[4658.06 --> 4659.70]  but he did ask
[4659.70 --> 4659.92]  right
[4659.92 --> 4660.80]  so why I think
[4660.80 --> 4661.44]  he didn't anyway
[4661.44 --> 4663.60]  and he'll probably
[4663.60 --> 4664.42]  think it's silly
[4664.42 --> 4665.72]  he'll probably think
[4665.72 --> 4666.28]  I'm stupid
[4666.28 --> 4667.94]  and I just don't want
[4667.94 --> 4668.50]  to get into a whole
[4668.50 --> 4669.26]  philosophical argument
[4669.26 --> 4670.00]  with someone right now
[4670.00 --> 4672.32]  I made excuses
[4672.32 --> 4674.20]  for the gospel
[4674.20 --> 4676.34]  now
[4676.34 --> 4678.06]  thankfully
[4678.06 --> 4679.40]  that's not the first
[4679.40 --> 4680.30]  time I've done that
[4680.30 --> 4683.34]  and so I'm aware
[4683.34 --> 4684.60]  of the temptation
[4684.60 --> 4685.28]  to do that
[4685.28 --> 4686.30]  so I caught myself
[4686.30 --> 4688.42]  and I forced myself
[4688.42 --> 4689.42]  to come back
[4689.42 --> 4690.40]  into that conversation
[4690.40 --> 4691.32]  I was aware
[4691.32 --> 4692.00]  of what was happening
[4692.00 --> 4692.68]  in my mind
[4692.68 --> 4693.58]  and had to make
[4693.58 --> 4694.06]  the decision
[4694.06 --> 4695.24]  to not let it continue
[4695.24 --> 4695.90]  and so instead
[4695.90 --> 4696.76]  I came back
[4696.76 --> 4697.76]  and I pushed through
[4697.76 --> 4698.66]  and I started asking
[4698.66 --> 4699.80]  him some questions
[4699.80 --> 4701.06]  and I started telling him
[4701.06 --> 4701.66]  a little bit about
[4701.66 --> 4702.68]  my own story
[4702.68 --> 4703.64]  and how
[4703.64 --> 4705.90]  Jesus had shaped
[4705.90 --> 4706.52]  my life
[4706.52 --> 4707.16]  and my family
[4707.16 --> 4708.18]  and brought us here
[4708.18 --> 4709.76]  and all of these things
[4709.76 --> 4710.40]  and you know what
[4710.40 --> 4711.04]  I found out
[4711.04 --> 4713.64]  this guy's already
[4713.64 --> 4714.20]  a Christian
[4714.20 --> 4716.38]  and he goes to church
[4716.38 --> 4716.88]  every week
[4716.88 --> 4717.50]  with his family
[4717.50 --> 4718.70]  and he was just wondering
[4718.70 --> 4720.32]  how his experience
[4720.32 --> 4721.84]  related to my experience
[4721.84 --> 4724.34]  my own embarrassment
[4724.34 --> 4726.50]  might have prevented me
[4726.50 --> 4727.44]  from finding a brother
[4727.44 --> 4728.04]  in Christ
[4728.04 --> 4732.26]  and also
[4732.26 --> 4733.10]  my own embarrassment
[4733.10 --> 4735.20]  might have prevented him
[4735.20 --> 4735.98]  from hearing the gospel
[4735.98 --> 4736.80]  for the first time
[4736.80 --> 4737.94]  now thankfully
[4737.94 --> 4738.88]  that wasn't the case
[4738.88 --> 4740.82]  thankfully God is bigger
[4740.82 --> 4741.82]  than my own failures
[4741.82 --> 4742.88]  and he covers
[4742.88 --> 4743.78]  that over
[4743.78 --> 4747.88]  but I
[4747.88 --> 4748.56]  even I
[4748.56 --> 4750.22]  need to remember
[4750.22 --> 4751.28]  that the gospel
[4751.28 --> 4752.44]  is the power
[4752.44 --> 4753.10]  of God
[4753.10 --> 4754.82]  that brings salvation
[4754.82 --> 4755.90]  to everyone
[4755.90 --> 4757.16]  who believes
[4757.16 --> 4757.64]  right
[4757.64 --> 4758.10]  that it's about
[4758.10 --> 4759.18]  God's power
[4759.18 --> 4760.62]  not my ability
[4760.62 --> 4762.38]  and then
[4762.38 --> 4763.84]  it's about their belief
[4763.84 --> 4764.40]  right
[4764.40 --> 4765.78]  not my persuasiveness
[4765.78 --> 4767.68]  and further
[4767.68 --> 4768.68]  that the compelling
[4768.68 --> 4770.02]  compelling beauty
[4770.02 --> 4771.00]  of the gospel
[4771.00 --> 4773.38]  actually saves me
[4773.38 --> 4775.06]  from my own inability
[4775.06 --> 4776.56]  right
[4776.56 --> 4777.36]  the gospel
[4777.36 --> 4778.40]  is the power
[4778.40 --> 4779.36]  of God
[4779.36 --> 4780.56]  that brings salvation
[4780.56 --> 4781.34]  to everyone
[4781.34 --> 4782.26]  who believes
[4782.26 --> 4783.72]  right
[4783.72 --> 4784.80]  it's about belief
[4784.80 --> 4786.82]  and that belief
[4786.82 --> 4788.24]  as we
[4788.24 --> 4789.88]  have already seen
[4789.88 --> 4790.96]  right
[4790.96 --> 4791.96]  from Ephesians 2
[4791.96 --> 4792.90]  that belief
[4792.90 --> 4794.12]  is a gift
[4794.12 --> 4795.24]  of God
[4795.24 --> 4796.80]  and so
[4796.80 --> 4797.36]  in having
[4797.36 --> 4797.92]  belief
[4797.92 --> 4798.48]  in having
[4798.48 --> 4799.22]  faith
[4799.22 --> 4800.06]  you are
[4800.06 --> 4801.32]  declared
[4801.32 --> 4802.14]  righteous
[4802.14 --> 4802.94]  what does we read
[4802.94 --> 4804.28]  for in the gospel
[4804.28 --> 4804.98]  the righteousness
[4804.98 --> 4805.66]  of God
[4805.66 --> 4806.30]  is revealed
[4806.30 --> 4806.94]  a righteousness
[4806.94 --> 4808.18]  that is by faith
[4808.18 --> 4809.14]  from first
[4809.14 --> 4810.08]  to last
[4810.08 --> 4814.22]  to be righteous
[4814.22 --> 4815.62]  in simple terms
[4815.62 --> 4816.80]  is to be
[4816.80 --> 4817.56]  made right
[4817.56 --> 4818.28]  with God
[4818.28 --> 4820.52]  God
[4820.52 --> 4821.70]  declares you
[4821.70 --> 4822.56]  righteous
[4822.56 --> 4823.78]  by grace
[4823.78 --> 4824.54]  through
[4824.54 --> 4825.42]  faith
[4825.42 --> 4827.16]  and that
[4827.16 --> 4827.70]  declaration
[4827.70 --> 4828.48]  of God
[4828.48 --> 4829.50]  is more than
[4829.50 --> 4830.62]  just an idea
[4830.62 --> 4831.64]  right
[4831.64 --> 4832.66]  when Paul says
[4832.66 --> 4833.40]  it is the power
[4833.40 --> 4833.96]  of God
[4833.96 --> 4834.38]  right
[4834.38 --> 4835.40]  because sometimes
[4835.40 --> 4835.88]  we think
[4835.88 --> 4836.50]  that declaration
[4836.50 --> 4837.04]  means that
[4837.04 --> 4837.68]  that God
[4837.68 --> 4838.48]  just no longer
[4838.48 --> 4839.22]  sees
[4839.22 --> 4840.90]  our unrighteousness
[4840.90 --> 4841.16]  right
[4841.16 --> 4841.82]  that he's choosing
[4841.82 --> 4842.70]  to ignore
[4842.70 --> 4843.68]  my sin
[4843.68 --> 4846.22]  but the declared
[4846.22 --> 4846.72]  righteousness
[4846.72 --> 4847.26]  of God
[4847.26 --> 4847.76]  comes with
[4847.76 --> 4848.20]  the full
[4848.20 --> 4848.78]  creative
[4848.78 --> 4849.34]  power
[4849.34 --> 4849.78]  of who
[4849.78 --> 4850.04]  God
[4850.04 --> 4850.44]  is
[4850.44 --> 4852.06]  remember
[4852.06 --> 4852.82]  the story
[4852.82 --> 4853.40]  of creation
[4853.40 --> 4853.92]  right
[4853.92 --> 4855.04]  God said
[4855.04 --> 4855.94]  let there
[4855.94 --> 4856.58]  be light
[4856.58 --> 4857.64]  and there
[4857.64 --> 4858.24]  was light
[4858.24 --> 4859.82]  his word
[4859.82 --> 4860.60]  creates
[4860.60 --> 4861.50]  reality
[4861.50 --> 4863.00]  right
[4863.00 --> 4863.30]  and so
[4863.30 --> 4864.42]  God speaks
[4864.42 --> 4865.74]  and reality
[4865.74 --> 4866.50]  is created
[4866.50 --> 4867.58]  God speaks
[4867.58 --> 4868.56]  and you
[4868.56 --> 4869.86]  are made
[4869.86 --> 4870.66]  righteous
[4870.66 --> 4871.28]  the new
[4871.28 --> 4871.90]  reality
[4871.90 --> 4873.00]  is by grace
[4873.00 --> 4873.52]  through faith
[4873.52 --> 4874.30]  you are
[4874.30 --> 4875.10]  righteous
[4875.10 --> 4876.32]  this is
[4876.32 --> 4877.30]  a reality
[4877.30 --> 4878.20]  defining
[4878.20 --> 4878.96]  decree
[4878.96 --> 4883.02]  and perhaps
[4883.02 --> 4884.86]  to be
[4884.86 --> 4885.28]  embarrassed
[4885.28 --> 4886.18]  by the gospel
[4886.18 --> 4887.52]  is to believe
[4887.52 --> 4888.40]  that God's
[4888.40 --> 4888.80]  decree
[4888.80 --> 4889.70]  is something
[4889.70 --> 4890.34]  less
[4890.34 --> 4891.94]  than reality
[4891.94 --> 4893.10]  defining
[4893.10 --> 4896.46]  now
[4896.46 --> 4898.14]  as I
[4898.14 --> 4899.38]  start wrapping
[4899.38 --> 4899.80]  this up
[4899.80 --> 4901.06]  here's what
[4901.06 --> 4901.72]  I don't want
[4901.72 --> 4902.38]  you to hear
[4902.38 --> 4903.30]  from me
[4903.30 --> 4903.92]  and then
[4903.92 --> 4904.18]  I'll end
[4904.18 --> 4904.52]  with two
[4904.52 --> 4905.20]  points
[4905.20 --> 4905.58]  of summary
[4905.58 --> 4906.16]  first
[4906.16 --> 4907.42]  don't
[4907.42 --> 4908.12]  confuse
[4908.12 --> 4908.64]  the
[4908.64 --> 4909.64]  exclusivity
[4909.64 --> 4910.16]  of the
[4910.16 --> 4910.60]  gospel
[4910.60 --> 4911.64]  for a
[4911.64 --> 4911.96]  shutting
[4911.96 --> 4912.48]  down
[4912.48 --> 4913.06]  of deep
[4913.06 --> 4913.86]  conversation
[4913.86 --> 4916.24]  I want
[4916.24 --> 4916.62]  to have
[4916.62 --> 4917.02]  deep
[4917.02 --> 4917.88]  meaningful
[4917.88 --> 4918.80]  processing
[4918.80 --> 4919.58]  conversations
[4919.58 --> 4920.12]  with you
[4920.12 --> 4920.86]  and in fact
[4920.86 --> 4921.52]  as Christians
[4921.52 --> 4922.10]  because we
[4922.10 --> 4922.62]  believe this
[4922.62 --> 4922.94]  gospel
[4922.94 --> 4923.62]  is from
[4923.62 --> 4923.96]  God
[4923.96 --> 4924.52]  about his
[4924.52 --> 4924.76]  son
[4924.76 --> 4925.44]  we should
[4925.44 --> 4925.76]  be the
[4925.76 --> 4926.14]  first
[4926.14 --> 4926.98]  to enter
[4926.98 --> 4927.40]  into
[4927.40 --> 4927.76]  these
[4927.76 --> 4928.18]  deep
[4928.18 --> 4929.14]  processing
[4929.14 --> 4929.98]  hard
[4929.98 --> 4930.86]  challenging
[4930.86 --> 4931.36]  kinds
[4931.36 --> 4931.52]  of
[4931.52 --> 4932.28]  conversations
[4932.28 --> 4934.78]  let people
[4934.78 --> 4935.30]  ask their
[4935.30 --> 4935.74]  questions
[4935.74 --> 4936.48]  to test
[4936.48 --> 4937.20]  the truth
[4937.20 --> 4937.82]  and the
[4937.82 --> 4938.28]  authenticity
[4938.28 --> 4939.06]  of the
[4939.06 --> 4939.46]  gospel
[4939.46 --> 4940.12]  and let
[4940.12 --> 4940.30]  God
[4940.30 --> 4940.74]  use
[4940.74 --> 4941.18]  that
[4941.18 --> 4942.34]  and so
[4942.34 --> 4942.64]  we're not
[4942.64 --> 4943.04]  shutting
[4943.04 --> 4943.42]  down
[4943.42 --> 4944.10]  conversations
[4944.10 --> 4944.84]  by saying
[4944.84 --> 4945.32]  this is
[4945.32 --> 4945.68]  what we
[4945.68 --> 4946.04]  believe
[4946.04 --> 4946.52]  and that
[4946.52 --> 4946.74]  this
[4946.74 --> 4947.18]  alone
[4947.18 --> 4947.84]  is the
[4947.84 --> 4948.02]  way
[4948.02 --> 4948.18]  of
[4948.18 --> 4948.58]  salvation
[4948.58 --> 4949.00]  in fact
[4949.00 --> 4949.32]  we are
[4949.32 --> 4949.80]  inviting
[4949.80 --> 4950.30]  them
[4950.30 --> 4953.60]  and then
[4953.60 --> 4954.28]  and here's
[4954.28 --> 4954.56]  where I'll
[4954.56 --> 4954.76]  land
[4954.76 --> 4956.46]  there are
[4956.46 --> 4957.12]  two reasons
[4957.12 --> 4958.26]  why you
[4958.26 --> 4958.74]  don't have
[4958.74 --> 4959.12]  to be
[4959.12 --> 4959.56]  ashamed
[4959.56 --> 4960.50]  of the
[4960.50 --> 4960.86]  gospel
[4960.86 --> 4962.34]  first and
[4962.34 --> 4963.10]  most important
[4963.10 --> 4963.48]  for your
[4963.48 --> 4963.86]  takeaway
[4963.86 --> 4964.66]  you don't
[4964.66 --> 4965.10]  have to be
[4965.10 --> 4965.46]  ashamed
[4965.46 --> 4965.68]  of the
[4965.68 --> 4966.00]  gospel
[4966.00 --> 4966.56]  because the
[4966.56 --> 4966.88]  gospel
[4966.88 --> 4967.30]  isn't
[4967.30 --> 4967.62]  about
[4967.62 --> 4968.06]  you
[4968.06 --> 4970.62]  and it's
[4970.62 --> 4971.22]  for you
[4971.22 --> 4972.40]  but it's
[4972.40 --> 4972.84]  about
[4972.84 --> 4973.52]  God
[4973.52 --> 4974.68]  right
[4974.68 --> 4974.90]  it's
[4974.90 --> 4975.36]  his
[4975.36 --> 4975.96]  message
[4975.96 --> 4976.62]  of redemption
[4976.62 --> 4977.54]  and salvation
[4977.54 --> 4978.26]  to the
[4978.26 --> 4978.52]  world
[4978.52 --> 4978.98]  it's about
[4978.98 --> 4979.40]  Jesus
[4979.40 --> 4980.12]  who lived
[4980.12 --> 4980.56]  the life
[4980.56 --> 4980.94]  I should
[4980.94 --> 4981.06]  have
[4981.06 --> 4981.34]  lived
[4981.34 --> 4981.84]  and who
[4981.84 --> 4982.18]  died
[4982.18 --> 4982.64]  the death
[4982.64 --> 4982.96]  that I
[4982.96 --> 4983.34]  deserve
[4983.34 --> 4985.42]  it's about
[4985.42 --> 4985.78]  Jesus
[4985.78 --> 4986.90]  who calls
[4986.90 --> 4987.38]  you out
[4987.38 --> 4988.02]  of darkness
[4988.02 --> 4989.58]  and restores
[4989.58 --> 4990.50]  you to
[4990.50 --> 4991.08]  communion
[4991.08 --> 4991.86]  with God
[4991.86 --> 4992.44]  who makes
[4992.44 --> 4993.42]  you right
[4993.42 --> 4994.70]  with God
[4994.70 --> 4995.18]  and so
[4995.18 --> 4996.10]  if being
[4996.10 --> 4997.16]  a gospel
[4997.16 --> 4997.84]  believing
[4997.84 --> 4998.48]  gospel
[4998.48 --> 4999.18]  transformed
[4999.18 --> 4999.64]  Christian
[4999.64 --> 5000.46]  makes you
[5000.46 --> 5000.98]  look a little
[5000.98 --> 5001.66]  foolish in
[5001.66 --> 5002.10]  the world
[5002.10 --> 5002.56]  or it makes
[5002.56 --> 5002.94]  you seem
[5002.94 --> 5003.20]  a little
[5003.20 --> 5003.74]  bit weird
[5003.74 --> 5004.28]  to the
[5004.28 --> 5004.70]  people who
[5004.70 --> 5005.40]  don't believe
[5005.40 --> 5006.26]  that's
[5006.26 --> 5006.66]  good
[5006.66 --> 5008.60]  that means
[5008.60 --> 5009.10]  you're doing
[5009.10 --> 5009.84]  something right
[5009.84 --> 5010.46]  in response
[5010.46 --> 5011.16]  to the gospel
[5011.16 --> 5011.88]  and with
[5011.88 --> 5012.42]  the gospel
[5012.42 --> 5013.10]  that means
[5013.10 --> 5013.56]  that it's
[5013.56 --> 5014.24]  settling
[5014.24 --> 5015.12]  deep down
[5015.12 --> 5015.86]  in you
[5015.86 --> 5016.94]  and transforming
[5016.94 --> 5017.94]  you
[5017.94 --> 5020.10]  and then the
[5020.10 --> 5020.68]  second reason
[5020.68 --> 5021.84]  that you don't
[5021.84 --> 5022.54]  need to be ashamed
[5022.54 --> 5023.18]  of the gospel
[5023.18 --> 5024.58]  is because
[5024.58 --> 5025.16]  it's true
[5025.16 --> 5027.38]  it's true
[5027.38 --> 5028.24]  it is a
[5028.24 --> 5029.16]  reality
[5029.16 --> 5030.54]  defining
[5030.54 --> 5031.72]  really
[5031.72 --> 5032.70]  real
[5032.70 --> 5033.60]  truth
[5033.60 --> 5034.36]  about who
[5034.36 --> 5034.88]  God is
[5034.88 --> 5035.50]  and what
[5035.50 --> 5036.10]  he has done
[5036.10 --> 5036.98]  in the world
[5036.98 --> 5037.66]  the gospel
[5037.66 --> 5038.14]  changes
[5038.14 --> 5038.76]  everything
[5038.76 --> 5039.60]  about who
[5039.60 --> 5040.06]  you are
[5040.06 --> 5040.58]  but also
[5040.58 --> 5041.10]  the gospel
[5041.10 --> 5041.56]  changes
[5041.56 --> 5042.10]  everything
[5042.10 --> 5042.82]  then
[5042.82 --> 5043.70]  about how
[5043.70 --> 5044.52]  you see
[5044.52 --> 5045.50]  the world
[5045.50 --> 5048.06]  and so
[5048.06 --> 5048.46]  the next
[5048.46 --> 5048.80]  time
[5048.80 --> 5050.54]  with gentleness
[5050.54 --> 5051.70]  and respect
[5051.70 --> 5054.10]  take the risk
[5054.10 --> 5055.32]  of offending
[5055.32 --> 5055.88]  someone
[5055.88 --> 5057.40]  with the gospel
[5057.40 --> 5059.84]  next time
[5059.84 --> 5060.32]  God gives you
[5060.32 --> 5061.06]  that opportunity
[5061.06 --> 5063.10]  to enter
[5063.10 --> 5064.16]  into a deep
[5064.16 --> 5065.28]  real conversation
[5065.28 --> 5065.80]  about who
[5065.80 --> 5066.32]  he is
[5066.32 --> 5066.60]  and what
[5066.60 --> 5066.88]  he has
[5066.88 --> 5067.08]  done
[5067.08 --> 5067.46]  in Jesus
[5067.46 --> 5067.96]  Christ
[5067.96 --> 5069.38]  take the
[5069.38 --> 5069.78]  chance
[5069.78 --> 5071.16]  and see
[5071.16 --> 5071.42]  what he
[5071.42 --> 5071.90]  might do
[5071.90 --> 5074.24]  because the
[5074.24 --> 5074.86]  gospel is
[5074.86 --> 5075.56]  not about
[5075.56 --> 5076.28]  you
[5076.28 --> 5076.94]  but about
[5076.94 --> 5077.78]  Jesus
[5077.78 --> 5078.86]  it also
[5078.86 --> 5079.56]  then
[5079.56 --> 5080.42]  provides
[5080.42 --> 5081.38]  a hope
[5081.38 --> 5082.06]  that's not
[5082.06 --> 5082.74]  contingent
[5082.74 --> 5083.40]  upon you
[5083.40 --> 5084.74]  the gospel
[5084.74 --> 5085.58]  provides a
[5085.58 --> 5086.00]  joy
[5086.00 --> 5086.66]  that's not
[5086.66 --> 5087.12]  dependent
[5087.12 --> 5087.74]  upon your
[5087.74 --> 5088.36]  feelings
[5088.36 --> 5089.30]  the gospel
[5089.30 --> 5089.94]  is a
[5089.94 --> 5090.42]  truth
[5090.42 --> 5090.98]  that is
[5090.98 --> 5091.68]  not limited
[5091.68 --> 5092.68]  by people's
[5092.68 --> 5093.10]  belief
[5093.10 --> 5093.62]  in it
[5093.62 --> 5094.20]  or not
[5094.20 --> 5096.66]  right
[5096.66 --> 5096.94]  like
[5096.94 --> 5098.30]  Tinkerbell
[5098.30 --> 5099.18]  in Peter Pan
[5099.18 --> 5099.60]  if you
[5099.60 --> 5099.94]  don't
[5099.94 --> 5100.48]  believe
[5100.48 --> 5101.30]  the
[5101.30 --> 5101.74]  fairies
[5101.74 --> 5102.30]  die
[5102.30 --> 5104.14]  that's
[5104.14 --> 5104.42]  not
[5104.42 --> 5104.84]  true
[5104.84 --> 5105.14]  of
[5105.14 --> 5105.56]  Jesus
[5105.56 --> 5106.96]  because
[5106.96 --> 5107.20]  he's
[5107.20 --> 5107.68]  real
[5107.68 --> 5108.22]  and it
[5108.22 --> 5108.48]  happened
[5108.48 --> 5109.18]  in history
[5109.18 --> 5110.06]  and whether
[5110.06 --> 5110.52]  or not
[5110.52 --> 5111.14]  you accept
[5111.14 --> 5111.28]  it
[5111.28 --> 5111.46]  whether
[5111.46 --> 5111.82]  or not
[5111.82 --> 5111.94]  you
[5111.94 --> 5112.20]  believe
[5112.20 --> 5112.34]  it
[5112.34 --> 5112.66]  doesn't
[5112.66 --> 5112.98]  change
[5112.98 --> 5113.16]  the
[5113.16 --> 5113.38]  fact
[5113.38 --> 5113.62]  that
[5113.62 --> 5113.82]  it
[5113.82 --> 5114.54]  is
[5114.54 --> 5115.24]  true
[5115.24 --> 5116.92]  I
[5116.92 --> 5117.08]  am
[5117.08 --> 5117.34]  not
[5117.34 --> 5117.78]  ashamed
[5117.78 --> 5118.08]  of the
[5118.08 --> 5118.40]  gospel
[5118.40 --> 5118.70]  because
[5118.70 --> 5118.98]  it is
[5118.98 --> 5119.16]  the
[5119.16 --> 5119.62]  power
[5119.62 --> 5120.24]  of
[5120.24 --> 5120.52]  God
[5120.52 --> 5120.70]  that
[5120.70 --> 5121.04]  brings
[5121.04 --> 5121.64]  salvation
[5121.64 --> 5122.00]  to
[5122.00 --> 5122.78]  everyone
[5122.78 --> 5123.68]  who
[5123.68 --> 5124.18]  believes
[5124.18 --> 5125.96]  don't
[5125.96 --> 5126.12]  be
[5126.12 --> 5126.74]  ashamed
[5126.74 --> 5127.48]  or
[5127.48 --> 5128.18]  embarrassed
[5128.18 --> 5128.80]  by the
[5128.80 --> 5129.26]  offense
[5129.26 --> 5129.72]  of the
[5129.72 --> 5130.12]  gospel
[5130.12 --> 5130.82]  rather
[5130.82 --> 5132.08]  like we're
[5132.08 --> 5132.66]  about to do
[5132.66 --> 5133.30]  in just a
[5133.30 --> 5133.58]  moment
[5133.58 --> 5134.70]  rather
[5134.70 --> 5135.66]  praise
[5135.66 --> 5136.46]  the name
[5136.46 --> 5137.28]  of the
[5137.28 --> 5137.66]  Lord
[5137.66 --> 5138.36]  our
[5138.36 --> 5138.72]  God
[5138.72 --> 5139.74]  praise
[5139.74 --> 5140.04]  his
[5140.04 --> 5140.54]  name
[5140.54 --> 5141.40]  forever
[5141.40 --> 5141.82]  more
[5141.82 --> 5142.90]  for
[5142.90 --> 5143.58]  endless
[5143.58 --> 5144.22]  days
[5144.22 --> 5145.14]  we
[5145.14 --> 5145.40]  will
[5145.40 --> 5145.88]  sing
[5145.88 --> 5146.58]  your
[5146.58 --> 5147.54]  praise
[5147.54 --> 5148.22]  amen
[5148.22 --> 5149.72]  let's
[5149.72 --> 5149.86]  pray
[5149.86 --> 5150.14]  together
[5150.14 --> 5153.44]  Lord

[5178.60 --> 5179.42]  among
[5179.42 --> 5179.88]  us
[5179.88 --> 5181.90]  the

[5182.76 --> 5183.22]  our
[5183.22 --> 5184.02]  being

[5222.88 --> 5223.00] 谢
[5223.00 --> 5223.86]  nucle
[5223.86 --> 5224.50]  millions
[5224.50 --> 5224.66]  of
[5224.66 --> 5233.44]  Where Jesus came and died for me
[5233.44 --> 5239.92]  I see His wounds, His depths, His feet
[5239.92 --> 5248.14]  My Savior, that cursed tree
[5248.14 --> 5259.08]  His body bowed and drenched in tears
[5259.08 --> 5266.22]  They laid Him down in Joseph's tomb
[5266.22 --> 5273.22]  The entrance sealed by heavy storm
[5273.22 --> 5280.22]  But sighed out still and all alone
[5280.22 --> 5292.22]  O praise the name of the Lord our God
[5293.04 --> 5299.22]  O praise His name forevermore
[5299.22 --> 5307.66]  For endless days we will sing Your praise
[5307.66 --> 5314.22]  O Lord, O Lord our God
[5314.22 --> 5324.66]  Then on the third at break of dawn
[5324.66 --> 5331.22]  The Son of Heaven rose again
[5331.22 --> 5339.66]  O temple dead, where is your sting?
[5339.66 --> 5345.66]  The angels roar for Christ the King
[5345.66 --> 5357.10]  O praise the name of the Lord our God
[5357.10 --> 5364.10]  O praise His name forevermore
[5364.10 --> 5371.10]  For endless days we will sing Your praise
[5371.10 --> 5378.54]  O Lord, O Lord our God
[5378.54 --> 5381.98]  O Lord our God
[5381.98 --> 5388.86]  He shall return in robes of white
[5388.86 --> 5396.40]  The blazing sun shall pierce the night
[5396.40 --> 5403.88]  And I will rise among the saints
[5403.88 --> 5410.84]  My gaze transfixed on Jesus' face
[5410.84 --> 5431.10] ôi-o-wاز-reads
[5431.10 --> 5451.26]  O praise the name of the Lord our God
[5451.26 --> 5458.36]  O praise His name forevermore
[5458.36 --> 5465.26]  For endless days we will sing Your praise
[5465.26 --> 5472.00]  O Lord, O Lord our God
[5472.00 --> 5479.34]  O praise the name of the Lord our God
[5479.34 --> 5486.18]  O praise His name forevermore
[5486.18 --> 5493.08]  For endless days we will sing Your praise
[5493.08 --> 5499.82]  O Lord, O Lord our God
[5499.82 --> 5506.72]  O Lord, O Lord our God
[5506.72 --> 5533.80]  Before we go into this week ahead, we will receive from God His blessing for our lives of faith and response and gratitude to all that He has done.
[5533.80 --> 5540.70]  And as we go this morning, I want to invite you to stick around following service.
[5540.70 --> 5547.60]  We have some coffee and refreshments there available. We'd love to connect with you.
[5547.60 --> 5554.50]  Also, if you are a first time visitor or if you've been visiting regularly and haven't yet connected with us, we have these cards.
[5554.50 --> 5556.50]  They're in your seats there.
[5556.50 --> 5562.50]  You can connect with us by filling out one of those and then just dropping it at the connect table on your way out or there's a QR code.
[5562.50 --> 5571.40]  You can scan that and then do the online version and someone will reach out to you and see how we might connect with you in that regard.
[5571.40 --> 5580.40]  Additionally, after service, if you're looking for prayer, there are people who will be in the back with name tags on with yellow squares on them.
[5580.40 --> 5585.30]  They would love to meet you where you're at and pray with you.
[5585.30 --> 5592.40]  As we go then receive the blessing of God for our journeys, life and faith in Him together.
[5592.40 --> 5597.40]  Lord bless you and keep you.
[5597.40 --> 5602.40]  Lord make His face to shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[5602.40 --> 5608.40]  The Lord turn His face towards you and give you His peace.
[5608.40 --> 5611.40]  Amen.
[5611.40 --> 5634.40]  May our homes be filled with dancing.
[5634.40 --> 5641.40]  May our streets be filled with joy.
[5641.40 --> 5649.40]  May your justice bow to Jesus.
[5649.40 --> 5655.40]  As the people turn and pray.
[5655.40 --> 5662.40]  From the mountain to the valley.
[5662.40 --> 5666.40]  Hear our praises.
[5666.40 --> 5669.40]  Rise to you.
[5669.40 --> 5677.40]  From the heavens to the nations.
[5677.40 --> 5681.40]  Hear our singing.
[5681.40 --> 5687.40]  Hail the air.
[5687.40 --> 5694.40]  May our light shine in the darkness.
[5694.40 --> 5699.40]  May our light shine in the darkness.
[5699.40 --> 5708.40]  As we walk before the cross.
[5708.40 --> 5714.40]  May your glory fill the whole earth.
[5714.40 --> 5715.40]  As the water or the sea.
[5715.40 --> 5716.40]  As the water or the sea.
[5716.40 --> 5721.40]  As the water or the sea.
[5721.40 --> 5729.40]  From the mountain to the valley.
[5729.40 --> 5734.40]  Hear our praises.
[5734.40 --> 5737.40]  Rise to you.
[5737.40 --> 5738.40]  From the heavens.
[5738.40 --> 5739.40]  From the mountains.
[5739.40 --> 5741.40]  To the mountains.
[5741.40 --> 5742.40]  Hear our singing.
[5742.40 --> 5747.40]  Hear our singing.
[5747.40 --> 5752.40]  Fill the air.
[5752.40 --> 5767.40]  From the fountain to the valley, here are praises, rise to you.
[5767.40 --> 5782.40]  From the heavens to the nations, here are singing LVM.
[5797.40 --> 5827.38]  piano plays softly
[5827.40 --> 5857.38]  piano plays softly
[5857.40 --> 5887.38]  piano plays softly
[5887.38 --> 5899.38]  piano plays softly
[5899.38 --> 5901.38]  Hey, you...
[5917.38 --> 5931.38]  piano plays softly
