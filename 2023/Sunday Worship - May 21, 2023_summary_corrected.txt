• Death frees you from the law of marriage and remarriage is allowed
• Marital intimacy is only permissible within a valid marriage
• Only death can break the bonds of marriage
• The law does not apply to the dead, so it cannot bind them in marriage or sin

• Obedience to Christ and bearing fruit for God as a joyful response to our union with Him, rather than trying to earn salvation by obeying the law.
• The question of how far is too far in relationships is often framed from a legalistic perspective
• This approach focuses on avoiding sin by not breaking rules, rather than pursuing Christ
• Reframing the question to prioritize pursuit of Christ in relationships provides better guidance
• This perspective should be applied not only to romantic relationships but to all areas of life
• Instead of asking "how far can I go," ask "am I honouring Christ" or "how close am I to Christ"
