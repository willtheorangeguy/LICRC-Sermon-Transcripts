[0.00 --> 4.18]  that you write a note of encouragement or thank you to them.
[4.82 --> 7.82]  And sometimes you don't have a card with you or at home,
[8.02 --> 11.66]  and so then you just, if you want to just get one from this basket
[11.66 --> 15.24]  and write a note and put it in their mailbox or just give it to them personally.
[16.38 --> 24.86]  We just all need encouragement and realize the power of just a little note of encouragement.
[24.86 --> 29.32]  So just kind of remember that, okay, the power of a note. Thanks.
[30.00 --> 34.80]  Thank you, Wendy.
[37.32 --> 44.08]  Following our worship this morning, we are also inviting you to a time
[44.08 --> 48.80]  where we're going to hear some stories from those who went on the Mexico mission trip.
[49.50 --> 54.76]  And so for about an hour after service, we'll have coffee and fellowship together,
[54.76 --> 57.64]  and then some of us will move back into here.
[57.64 --> 61.06]  There's buns and other goodies and the like to share.
[61.26 --> 65.22]  As we hear from the team that went to Mexico, they tell us about what they've seen,
[65.56 --> 67.40]  and we can interact with them a little bit.
[67.52 --> 70.28]  And so please, you saw the invitation for that.
[70.34 --> 72.44]  If you get the midweek memo and the e-bulletin,
[72.96 --> 77.12]  please stick around and hang out for that conversation as well.
[77.12 --> 83.34]  Lastly, Josh isn't here, but the young adult event that was scheduled for this evening
[83.34 --> 89.70]  is postponed to next week because of the raising kids in a hypersexualized culture conversation.
[90.22 --> 94.88]  If you have any questions about that, you can see Instagram or talk to Josh, and he'll address it.
[95.66 --> 97.24]  I think that's all the announcements.
[97.24 --> 102.16]  Would you stand, and we can be welcomed in God's presence together.
[106.24 --> 110.30]  We gather together in this place because God is here.
[110.72 --> 113.22]  He meets us here, welcomes us into his presence,
[113.34 --> 116.72]  and we mark that by receiving the greeting of God.
[116.80 --> 120.14]  And so I invite you to receive the greeting of God.
[120.14 --> 126.14]  Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father,
[126.22 --> 129.00]  from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son, and our Savior,
[129.44 --> 131.88]  through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[133.12 --> 133.42]  Amen.
[134.20 --> 136.44]  I invite you to turn to those around you,
[136.56 --> 139.60]  welcome them into worship past the peace of Christ this morning.
[141.86 --> 143.12]  Peace of Christ. Good morning.
[150.14 --> 180.12]  We wanted to just share for those that are joining us,
[180.12 --> 181.74]  on our live stream this morning.
[182.18 --> 185.56]  Unfortunately, we won't have lyrics available to you,
[185.78 --> 189.16]  but please join us when you can in worship this morning.
[191.36 --> 192.26]  Good morning.
[192.80 --> 195.70]  Our call to worship this morning comes from Psalm 9.
[196.54 --> 199.26]  I will give thanks to the Lord with my whole heart.
[199.68 --> 202.86]  I will recount all of your wonderful deeds.
[203.38 --> 205.66]  I will be glad and exult in you.
[206.08 --> 209.16]  I will sing praise to your name, O Most High.
[209.16 --> 211.16]  Let's worship together.
[211.16 --> 211.18]  Let's worship together.
[211.18 --> 213.18]  Almighty, Most Holy God.
[213.18 --> 215.18]  Almighty, Most Holy God.
[215.18 --> 218.18]  Almighty, Most Holy God.
[218.18 --> 224.18]  Almighty, Most Holy God.
[224.18 --> 228.18]  Faithful through the ages.
[228.18 --> 234.18]  Almighty, Most Holy Lord.
[234.18 --> 236.18]  Glorious, Most Holy God.
[236.18 --> 239.18]  Glorious, Almighty God.
[239.18 --> 252.34]  The beasts of the field, the birds of the air, are silent to call out your name.
[252.34 --> 254.34]  The earth has no voice.
[254.34 --> 255.34]  The earth has no voice.
[255.34 --> 257.34]  And I have no choice.
[257.34 --> 261.34]  But to magnify God unashamed.
[261.34 --> 266.34]  Let the rocks be kept silent for one more day.
[266.34 --> 268.34]  Let the whole world sing out.
[268.34 --> 271.34]  Let the people sing.
[271.34 --> 281.34]  Lord, The churn that I have remembered.
[281.34 --> 294.40]  Through the ages, almighty, most holy Lord, glorious, almighty God.
[296.40 --> 306.48]  Well, time marches on, with the innocence gone, and the darkness has covered the earth.
[306.48 --> 315.06]  But the Spirit still dwells, He speaks it as well, and the hopeless still offer new birth.
[316.32 --> 320.94]  He will break the leash of death, it will have no sting.
[321.24 --> 327.44]  Let the prisoner go free, join the dance and sing.
[327.44 --> 336.90]  Almighty, most holy God, faithful through the ages.
[337.82 --> 347.66]  Almighty, most holy Lord, glorious, almighty God.
[357.44 --> 387.42]  Thank you.
[387.44 --> 395.22]  Worthy of every song we could ever sing.
[396.36 --> 401.44]  Worthy of all the praise we could ever bring.
[403.26 --> 407.50]  Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe.

[455.16 --> 459.00]  And show me who you are.
[459.20 --> 462.40]  And fill me with your heart.
[462.40 --> 469.40]  And lead me in your love to those around me.
[469.40 --> 470.40]  Amen.
[470.40 --> 486.82]  Jesus, the name above every other name.
[486.82 --> 493.32]  Jesus, the only one who could ever sing.

[494.32 --> 495.32]  Amen.
[495.32 --> 496.32]  Jesus, the only one who could ever sing.

[506.32 --> 509.32]  Holy, there is no one like you.
[509.32 --> 513.42]  Holy, there is no one like you.
[513.42 --> 516.78]  There is none beside you.
[516.78 --> 521.42]  Open up my eyes in wonder.

[525.32 --> 528.52]  And fill me with your heart.
[528.76 --> 535.46]  And lead me in your love to those around me.
[539.32 --> 567.88]  I will build my life upon your love.
[567.88 --> 573.04]  It is a firm foundation.
[573.04 --> 580.66]  I will put my trust in you alone.
[580.66 --> 585.86]  And I will not be shaken.
[585.86 --> 593.40]  I will build my life upon your love.
[593.40 --> 598.56]  It is a firm foundation.
[598.56 --> 606.18]  I will put my trust in you alone.
[606.18 --> 611.40]  And I will not be shaken.
[611.40 --> 616.62]  Holy, there is no one like you.
[616.62 --> 620.18]  There is none beside you.
[620.18 --> 625.34]  Open up my eyes in wonder.
[625.34 --> 629.08]  And show me who you are.
[629.08 --> 632.60]  And fill me with your heart.
[632.60 --> 641.02]  And lead me in your love to those around me.
[641.02 --> 648.30]  Please join me in prayer.
[650.30 --> 656.46]  Dear Father in heaven, we come with humble hearts this morning, confessing that we continue
[656.46 --> 657.06]  to sin.
[657.90 --> 660.74]  That your ways haven't always been our ways.
[661.68 --> 664.90]  Forgive us when we haven't always valued what you value.
[664.90 --> 670.22]  For living selfish lives that aren't completely surrendered to you.
[671.28 --> 674.14]  Lord, forgive our shallow pursuits of this world.
[674.46 --> 679.34]  And change our hearts so that we can pursue abundant life with you.
[680.16 --> 685.40]  For you are the one that can fill the deepest places of our hearts and our minds.
[685.40 --> 687.38]  In Jesus' name we pray.
[687.92 --> 688.22]  Amen.
[690.08 --> 693.84]  In Zephaniah 3, we read these words of assurance.
[694.56 --> 697.70]  Be glad and rejoice with all your heart.
[698.50 --> 700.70]  The Lord has taken away your punishment.
[701.42 --> 703.20]  He has turned back your enemy.
[704.00 --> 705.68]  The Lord is with you.
[706.44 --> 708.76]  Never again will you fear any harm.
[709.26 --> 711.26]  The Lord your God is with you.
[711.56 --> 713.54]  The mighty warrior who saves.
[713.54 --> 716.56]  He will take great delight in you.
[717.40 --> 724.40]  In his love, he will no longer rebuke you, but will rejoice over you with singing.
[724.40 --> 746.04]  All these pieces broken and scattered.
[746.04 --> 752.04]  In mercy gathered, mended and whole.
[753.68 --> 758.62]  Empty handed, but not forsaken.
[759.62 --> 761.90]  I've been set free.
[762.90 --> 765.04]  I've been set free.
[766.90 --> 772.96]  Amazing grace, how sweet the sound.
[772.96 --> 777.82]  That saved a wretch like me.
[778.82 --> 785.78]  I once was lost, but now I am found.
[786.14 --> 789.96]  Was blind, but now I see.
[789.96 --> 795.82]  I can see you now.

[809.82 --> 816.12]  Raising up the broken to life.
[816.12 --> 831.30]  You take our failure.
[831.30 --> 834.40]  You take our weakness.
[834.40 --> 840.68]  You set your treasure in jars of clay.
[840.68 --> 844.60]  So take this heart, Lord.
[844.60 --> 847.32]  I'll be your vessel.
[847.32 --> 850.90]  The world you see.
[851.12 --> 854.78]  Your life in me.

[1219.98 --> 1225.46]  the giving of our gifts for the budget, which covers the administration of the church and
[1225.46 --> 1232.92]  its ministries, and the special offering today, which is world-renew Turkey-Syria earthquake.
[1234.06 --> 1242.24]  In the early morning hours of February 6th this year, a powerful 7.8 earthquake rocked
[1242.24 --> 1249.38]  southeastern Turkey and Syria, killing thousands of people as they slept, injuring tens of
[1249.38 --> 1255.48]  thousands more, and reducing five-story buildings to piles of rubble. A few hours later, another
[1255.48 --> 1261.56]  earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 hit the region, causing even more heartbreak and damage.
[1262.64 --> 1269.24]  One of the hardest-hit regions in Syria is in the north of the country near Aleppo, where millions
[1269.24 --> 1275.70]  have already been enduring the hardships of the ongoing civil war, including families in refugee
[1275.70 --> 1282.70]  camps on both sides of the Syria-Turkey border. At least 50,000 deaths and over 100,000 injuries
[1286.70 --> 1293.70]  were reported in Turkey, and at least 15.73 million people and 4 million buildings were affected.
[1294.70 --> 1299.70]  2 million residents were evacuated to other provinces, and 2.7 million people are homeless. Many roads
[1299.70 --> 1322.70]  and highways have been severely damaged, making rescue efforts even more difficult. In Syria, where the Syrian rescue teams and citizens of the region say this disaster has created conditions not seen at any point during the 12 years of war.
[1322.70 --> 1339.70]  At least 5.3 million people in northern Syria are homeless, and another 10.9 million people, which is nearly half the Syrian population, were affected.
[1339.70 --> 1354.70]  World Renew is requesting donations and prayers to help people suffering from the earthquake, and also for the World Renew staff and the partners that they work with in the region.

[1364.70 --> 1369.70]  Next week's offering is for the budget and pastor church resources.
[1369.70 --> 1399.68]  Thank you.
[1399.70 --> 1415.10]  Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul, worship his holy name.
[1415.10 --> 1427.76]  Sing like never before, O my soul, I'll worship your holy name.
[1429.70 --> 1437.14]  The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning.
[1437.70 --> 1442.64]  It's time to sing your song again.
[1443.24 --> 1449.70]  Whatever may pass and whatever lies before me,
[1449.70 --> 1457.70]  let me be singing when the evening comes.
[1457.70 --> 1471.70]  Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul, worship his holy name.
[1471.70 --> 1484.14]  Sing like never before, O my soul, I'll worship your holy name.
[1484.14 --> 1494.42]  You're rich in love and you're slow to anger.
[1495.08 --> 1500.00]  Your name is great and your heart is kind.
[1500.00 --> 1506.48]  For all your goodness I will keep on singing.
[1508.00 --> 1514.96]  Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find.
[1514.96 --> 1529.16]  Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul, worship his holy name.
[1529.16 --> 1540.16]  Sing like never before, O my soul, I'll worship your holy name.
[1540.16 --> 1551.16]  And on that day when my strength is failing,
[1551.16 --> 1557.22]  The end draws near and my time has come.
[1557.22 --> 1564.16]  Still my soul will sing your praise unending.
[1564.16 --> 1571.16]  Ten thousand years and then forevermore.
[1571.16 --> 1586.16]  Bless the Lord, O my soul, I'll worship your holy name.

[1598.16 --> 1611.16]  Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul, worship his holy name.
[1611.16 --> 1624.16]  Sing like never before, O my soul, O my soul, I'll worship your holy name.
[1624.16 --> 1630.16]  I'll worship your holy name.
[1630.16 --> 1636.16]  Lord, I'll worship your holy name.
[1636.16 --> 1638.16]  Amen.
[1641.16 --> 1650.16]  Good morning.
[1650.16 --> 1653.16]  My name is Mr. Mike and I'd like to invite all the kids up.
[1653.16 --> 1657.16]  Kids of really any age, but those of us going off to children's worship time
[1657.16 --> 1661.16]  are going to be ages three to grade four.
[1661.16 --> 1666.16]  Oh boy, you guys get so close.
[1666.16 --> 1667.16]  Hi, guys.
[1667.16 --> 1669.16]  How are you guys?
[1669.16 --> 1670.16]  You're good.
[1670.16 --> 1671.16]  You're good.
[1671.16 --> 1672.16]  You're good.
[1672.16 --> 1673.16]  Okay.
[1673.16 --> 1677.16]  Well, in children's worship time, we started a new topic.
[1677.16 --> 1679.16]  Do you guys know what it is?
[1679.16 --> 1680.16]  I know.
[1680.16 --> 1681.16]  It's a tricky question.
[1681.16 --> 1683.16]  We started the basics, it's called.
[1683.16 --> 1689.16]  So we've had now celebrated Easter and Jesus has gone back up to heaven.
[1689.16 --> 1691.16]  And we have this big story we've been learning about.
[1691.16 --> 1698.16]  And now we're going, what are the basics of what does it mean to follow Jesus and to be a Christian?
[1698.16 --> 1699.16]  Right?
[1699.16 --> 1700.16]  That's what a Christian is.
[1700.16 --> 1701.16]  Someone who follows Christ.
[1701.16 --> 1706.16]  So today's topic, I have a special illustration here that Mr. Matias is going to help me out with.
[1706.16 --> 1711.16]  We're going to phone him up on this here, fan-dangled, fancy telephone.
[1711.16 --> 1713.16]  Does this look like a phone?
[1713.16 --> 1716.16]  What does a phone look like to you guys?
[1716.16 --> 1720.16]  It's probably like something like this one in my pocket, this flat thing.
[1720.16 --> 1725.16]  Did you know back in the olden days, phones used to have to have cords on them?
[1725.16 --> 1730.16]  Not quite like this, but not too different.
[1730.16 --> 1733.16]  Mr. Matias is going to go down the aisle.
[1733.16 --> 1735.16]  We'll pick, maybe go that one.
[1735.16 --> 1739.16]  And he is, we're going to phone him on our here fancy phone.
[1739.16 --> 1741.16]  And we're going to ask him about today's topic.
[1741.16 --> 1744.16]  I maybe was a bit overzealous with the string.
[1744.16 --> 1745.16]  Okay.
[1749.16 --> 1751.16]  Okay, I'm going to need you guys to come and help me over here.
[1751.16 --> 1754.16]  If we, this is how this trick works.
[1754.16 --> 1758.16]  He's way over there and that guy, he can barely talk.
[1758.16 --> 1759.16]  He's so quiet.
[1759.16 --> 1762.16]  So he is going to, we're going to call him up on our little telephone here,
[1762.16 --> 1767.16]  our tin can phone and ask him about today's topic.
[1767.16 --> 1769.16]  Go a little further back.
[1772.16 --> 1775.16]  Hey, Mr. Matias, what's our topic for today?
[1777.16 --> 1780.16]  Oh, I can hear him in here.
[1780.16 --> 1782.16]  Do you guys want to hear him through the funny phone?
[1782.16 --> 1785.16]  Does anybody know what he's saying?
[1785.16 --> 1788.16]  Sounds like he's underwater, but here, let's see.
[1788.16 --> 1789.16]  Can you hear him?
[1789.16 --> 1791.16]  Christa, I'll get my finger out of the way.
[1794.16 --> 1795.16]  Did you hear him?
[1795.16 --> 1796.16]  No?
[1796.16 --> 1798.16]  How about, we'll try one more person.
[1798.16 --> 1799.16]  I did kind of hear him.
[1799.16 --> 1800.16]  It kind of works.
[1800.16 --> 1801.16]  Let's see if Haley, she's right in front here.
[1801.16 --> 1806.16]  Oh, what did he say?
[1806.16 --> 1808.16]  It's hard to see.
[1808.16 --> 1809.16]  I know, it's a little bit muffled.
[1809.16 --> 1810.16]  We'll try one more person.
[1810.16 --> 1813.16]  Maybe Jade has a good, oh, do you want to give it a shot?
[1813.16 --> 1815.16]  Come on up.
[1815.16 --> 1816.16]  Isn't it weird?
[1816.16 --> 1818.16]  Phones with wires.
[1818.16 --> 1824.16]  What topic did he say we're doing today?
[1824.16 --> 1828.16]  No, I think he said today's topic is prayer.
[1828.16 --> 1836.16]  And sometimes, prayer is kind of like sending up a phone call to God, right?
[1836.16 --> 1838.16]  Or to Jesus or the Holy Spirit.
[1838.16 --> 1840.16]  They're all part of God.
[1840.16 --> 1844.16]  So, but it's a little less tricky than using a funny tin can phone, I think.
[1844.16 --> 1846.16]  So, we're going to talk more about that in children's worship time.
[1846.16 --> 1850.16]  Thanks, Mr. Matias, for dealing with our phone.
[1850.16 --> 1855.16]  So, let's do the blessing and then we'll go off to the big room and we'll talk some more about prayer.
[1855.16 --> 1856.16]  Okay?
[1856.16 --> 1858.16]  Let's stand together with the church.
[1858.16 --> 1862.16]  All right.
[1862.16 --> 1866.16]  All right.
[1866.16 --> 1869.16]  The Lord be with you.
[1869.16 --> 1870.16]  And also with you.
[1870.16 --> 1871.16]  All right. See you in children's worship time.
[1892.16 --> 1893.16]  Thank you.
[1893.16 --> 1894.16]  Thank you.
[1894.16 --> 1896.16]  Thank you.
[1896.16 --> 1898.16]  Thank you.
[1898.16 --> 1899.16]  Thank you.
[1899.16 --> 1903.16]  My name is John and I'm one of the elders in the church here.
[1903.16 --> 1907.16]  I would like to give a couple of notes before we pray.
[1907.16 --> 1914.16]  Fred Kuntz, mom, Nell Kuntz fell and broke her hip yesterday and has been surgery today.
[1914.16 --> 1916.16]  So, we need to keep hearing our prayers.
[1916.16 --> 1917.16]  Thank you.
[1917.16 --> 1918.16]  Thank you, sir.
[1918.16 --> 1920.16]  Also, Linda Rook's dad, Bert Kloss.
[1920.16 --> 1928.16]  There will be a funeral for him on Tuesday at 1 p.m. at the Langley at Canadian Reformed Church.
[1928.16 --> 1932.16]  So, we go to our God in prayer.
[1932.16 --> 1936.16]  Oh, Lord God, creator of the world.
[1936.16 --> 1939.72]  we give you the praise and honor and glory that is due your name.
[1941.12 --> 1942.46]  You have created everything.
[1942.84 --> 1944.32]  You have held everything in your hand.
[1944.90 --> 1946.62]  And we see your hand in creation.
[1946.86 --> 1953.36]  We see spring happening, sunshine, rain, plants coming out of the ground.
[1953.64 --> 1955.56]  Lord, we know that you are in control of everything.
[1957.10 --> 1958.56]  Lord, we come as broken people.
[1959.84 --> 1964.52]  We come before you and we confess that we have not always been true to you.
[1964.52 --> 1968.78]  Lord, we ask your blessing as we spend this time in worship.
[1969.54 --> 1973.54]  And we may give you the praise and honor and glory that is your name.
[1976.60 --> 1978.52]  Lord, we are a busy church.
[1978.80 --> 1982.84]  We have lots of activities and missions that are working.
[1983.48 --> 1987.04]  Lord, we pray a blessing on the children's worship time that is happening right now.
[1987.34 --> 1992.78]  We're thankful for Gems and Cadets Ministries, for Coffee Break Youth Ministries.
[1992.78 --> 1998.22]  Lord, we're thankful that we have volunteers that are able to help and give of their time
[1998.22 --> 2001.10]  and their tasks and their talents to serve you.
[2002.90 --> 2008.56]  Lord, we know that there are many people who are suffering and going through difficult times.
[2010.02 --> 2015.04]  Lord, we have people who are dealing with cancer and looking forward to healing through treatment.
[2015.04 --> 2017.00]  Lord, we pray for Cy Visser.
[2018.48 --> 2021.98]  We also pray for John Koning, who is a former member of our congregation,
[2022.14 --> 2027.90]  is also dealing with melanoma and looking forward to effective treatment for him.
[2029.12 --> 2036.48]  Lord, we pray for those that are suffering from mental illness or challenges of living on a daily basis.
[2036.48 --> 2040.98]  Lord, there's people in our congregation who suffer silently.
[2041.26 --> 2045.56]  We don't know who they are, but we ask your blessing on those who are going through that difficult time.
[2047.58 --> 2054.28]  Lord, we pray especially for Fred Kunzman, Nell, as she is undergoing surgery.
[2054.64 --> 2059.48]  Lord, that the surgeons may be able to repair her hip,
[2059.48 --> 2064.26]  that she may be able to be free from the pain and difficulties she has to experience.
[2066.50 --> 2072.34]  Lord, we also pray for Lady Rose Vita, who has been coming to our church recently,
[2072.94 --> 2075.72]  as she is also in poor health.
[2076.00 --> 2077.32]  We pray for healing for her.
[2078.58 --> 2082.44]  Lord, she is a new Christian coming to believe in you,
[2082.54 --> 2085.50]  and we pray that her faith may be strengthened through this time.
[2085.50 --> 2092.90]  Lord, we pray for our church council.
[2093.20 --> 2096.58]  Lord, as we are having nominations at this time,
[2097.18 --> 2099.66]  Lord, the nominations are supposed to be closing today.
[2100.40 --> 2103.32]  We're asking members of the congregation to open up their hearts
[2103.32 --> 2108.08]  to be willing to serve in the positions that are open at this time.
[2109.40 --> 2114.38]  For admin elders and deacons, Lord, we pray that that may be
[2114.38 --> 2118.78]  something that members of our congregation are willing to take on.
[2121.52 --> 2123.90]  Lord, we pray your blessing on the preaching of your word today.
[2124.22 --> 2127.12]  We're thankful that Chris is able to bring your word,
[2127.94 --> 2132.66]  that he may be able to bless us with the words that you have given him to speak to us,
[2133.36 --> 2134.74]  that we may open our hearts,
[2135.34 --> 2137.26]  we may be able to listen to those words
[2137.26 --> 2141.92]  and take him in our daily activities in this coming week.
[2146.12 --> 2147.58]  Lord, we pray for it,
[2149.24 --> 2153.88]  that we may be effective witnesses as we go out in this coming week
[2153.88 --> 2155.54]  in our jobs and our work.
[2156.34 --> 2158.46]  Lord, wherever we are, whatever we're going,
[2158.78 --> 2160.72]  that we may truly serve you.
[2160.72 --> 2165.40]  As in the words of Psalm 73,
[2166.28 --> 2168.56]  that we may desire nothing but you, God,
[2169.18 --> 2172.28]  in our weakness, you will be our strength forever.
[2173.88 --> 2176.14]  As for me, it is good to be near God.
[2176.80 --> 2178.98]  I will make the sovereign Lord my refuge.
[2179.72 --> 2181.52]  I will tell of all your deeds.
[2181.52 --> 2185.14]  May we indeed go out this week,
[2186.76 --> 2188.46]  strengthened to serve him,
[2189.16 --> 2193.82]  and be bold to let others know of God's greatness for us.
[2195.20 --> 2197.72]  We pray this all in the name of Jesus Christ,
[2197.82 --> 2200.18]  who gave his life for us on the cross.
[2200.94 --> 2201.26]  Amen.
[2211.52 --> 2228.04]  As you can see on the screen behind me this morning,
[2228.04 --> 2237.66]  we are going to start what will be a quick four-part series
[2237.66 --> 2239.68]  in the book of Jonah.
[2239.68 --> 2247.28]  Jonah is one of the so-called minor prophets.
[2248.42 --> 2253.28]  They're called minor prophets because their writings are shorter,
[2253.44 --> 2255.96]  not because their work was less significant.
[2258.34 --> 2260.84]  And this morning, we're going to start in Jonah 1.
[2261.60 --> 2264.22]  But what I would like to say before we read that together
[2264.22 --> 2269.06]  is that especially if you've grown up in the church,
[2269.68 --> 2273.58]  especially if you grew up with things like veggie tales
[2273.58 --> 2276.90]  or children's Bibles or that kind of thing,
[2277.30 --> 2279.56]  you're going to come into the story of Jonah
[2279.56 --> 2282.64]  with all sorts of expectations and preconceived notions
[2282.64 --> 2284.36]  about what happens and what it's about.
[2286.04 --> 2289.06]  I think you will be surprised
[2289.06 --> 2292.96]  because our children's Bible version of the story of Jonah
[2292.96 --> 2296.92]  isn't actually what's going on.
[2297.92 --> 2299.54]  So I whet your appetite with that.
[2300.04 --> 2302.38]  We'll start with Jonah 1 together.
[2303.26 --> 2304.92]  Is it on the screen with our text?
[2305.02 --> 2305.30]  Excellent.
[2305.80 --> 2306.82]  So it will be on the screen.
[2307.08 --> 2309.86]  As always, I encourage you to have a Bible in front of you
[2309.86 --> 2312.44]  because we will refer back throughout.
[2312.44 --> 2317.48]  Jonah 1.
[2319.34 --> 2323.42]  The word of the Lord came to Jonah, son of Amite.
[2324.34 --> 2328.36]  Go to the great city of Nineveh and preach against it
[2328.36 --> 2331.18]  because its wickedness has come up before me.
[2332.34 --> 2336.02]  But Jonah ran away from the Lord and headed for Tarshish.
[2336.66 --> 2338.40]  He went down to Joppa,
[2338.80 --> 2341.56]  where he found a ship bound for that port.
[2341.56 --> 2343.76]  After paying the fare,
[2343.90 --> 2348.26]  he went aboard and sailed for Tarshish to flee from the Lord.
[2349.82 --> 2352.88]  Then the Lord sent a great wind on the sea
[2352.88 --> 2355.32]  and such a violent storm arose
[2355.32 --> 2357.60]  that the ship threatened to break up.
[2358.58 --> 2360.16]  All the sailors were afraid
[2360.16 --> 2363.02]  and each cried out to his own God.
[2363.86 --> 2367.88]  And they threw the cargo into the sea to lighten the ship.
[2367.88 --> 2372.56]  But Jonah had gone below deck,
[2373.08 --> 2376.04]  where he lay down and fell into a deep sleep.
[2376.82 --> 2379.24]  The captain went to him and said,
[2379.60 --> 2380.58]  How can you sleep?
[2380.74 --> 2382.96]  Get up and call on your God.
[2383.38 --> 2385.28]  Maybe he will take notice of us
[2385.28 --> 2386.76]  so that we will not perish.
[2386.76 --> 2390.56]  Then the sailors said to each other,
[2391.10 --> 2393.78]  Come, let us cast lots out
[2393.78 --> 2397.10]  to find out who is responsible for this calamity.
[2398.48 --> 2402.88]  They cast lots and the lot fell on Jonah.
[2403.92 --> 2405.18]  So they asked him,
[2405.72 --> 2409.86]  Tell us, who is responsible for making all this trouble for us?
[2409.86 --> 2411.76]  What kind of work do you do?
[2411.90 --> 2413.00]  Where do you come from?
[2413.08 --> 2413.90]  What is your country?
[2414.28 --> 2415.54]  From what people are you?
[2416.80 --> 2417.74]  And he answered,
[2418.70 --> 2419.64]  I am a Hebrew.
[2420.46 --> 2422.78]  I worship the Lord, the God of heaven,
[2422.84 --> 2425.04]  who made the sea and the dry land.
[2426.26 --> 2427.74]  This terrified them,
[2427.80 --> 2428.34]  and they asked,
[2428.56 --> 2429.46]  What have you done?
[2430.24 --> 2432.44]  They knew he was running away from the Lord
[2432.44 --> 2434.26]  because he had already told them so.
[2435.02 --> 2437.12]  The sea was getting rougher and rougher,
[2437.32 --> 2438.14]  and so they asked him,
[2438.14 --> 2439.64]  What should we do to you
[2439.64 --> 2441.74]  to make the sea calm down for us?
[2442.76 --> 2445.74]  Pick me up and throw me into the sea,
[2445.88 --> 2446.52]  he replied,
[2446.86 --> 2448.22]  and it will become calm.
[2449.00 --> 2450.72]  I know that it is my fault
[2450.72 --> 2453.04]  that this great storm has come upon you.
[2454.70 --> 2457.72]  Instead, the men did their best
[2457.72 --> 2460.10]  to row back to land,
[2460.78 --> 2461.70]  but they could not,
[2462.20 --> 2464.68]  for the sea grew even wilder than before.
[2464.68 --> 2468.38]  Then they cried out to the Lord,
[2468.84 --> 2469.78]  Please, Lord,
[2470.02 --> 2472.86]  do not let us die for taking this man's life.
[2473.14 --> 2474.38]  Do not hold us accountable
[2474.38 --> 2475.82]  for killing an innocent man,
[2475.92 --> 2477.12]  for you, Lord,
[2477.24 --> 2479.78]  have done as you pleased.
[2481.16 --> 2482.40]  Then they took Jonah
[2482.40 --> 2484.04]  and threw him overboard,
[2484.64 --> 2486.66]  and the raging sea grew calm.
[2487.70 --> 2488.30]  And at this,
[2488.44 --> 2490.68]  the men greatly feared the Lord,
[2490.68 --> 2493.02]  and they offered a sacrifice to the Lord
[2493.02 --> 2494.64]  and made vows to him.
[2496.34 --> 2498.56]  Now the Lord provided a huge fish
[2498.56 --> 2499.80]  to swallow Jonah,
[2500.08 --> 2502.38]  and Jonah was in the belly of the fish
[2502.38 --> 2504.96]  three days and three nights.
[2506.36 --> 2507.80]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2507.80 --> 2518.54]  One of the,
[2519.70 --> 2525.04]  what I consider to be the great joys
[2525.04 --> 2527.76]  of the work that I get to do as pastor
[2527.76 --> 2532.92]  is teaching classes on the Bible
[2532.92 --> 2536.30]  or discipling people one-on-one
[2536.30 --> 2540.22]  and helping them in their relationship to God.
[2542.00 --> 2544.80]  And one of the reasons I love that so much
[2544.80 --> 2547.64]  is because as we dig into the Bible,
[2548.20 --> 2549.84]  invariably, it seems,
[2550.22 --> 2552.62]  we come to a point or a conversation
[2552.62 --> 2553.64]  or a question,
[2554.20 --> 2557.14]  and it's like a light bulb goes off
[2557.14 --> 2559.28]  or a connection is made, right,
[2559.34 --> 2560.24]  where it's something that people
[2560.24 --> 2561.30]  hadn't seen before,
[2561.30 --> 2563.04]  and they're like, wow,
[2563.36 --> 2564.64]  that's really neat.
[2565.18 --> 2567.14]  That moment of surprise,
[2567.78 --> 2568.78]  if you're a teacher,
[2569.00 --> 2570.84]  you probably know what I'm talking about, right,
[2570.88 --> 2571.68]  where it clicks,
[2572.08 --> 2573.34]  and you see it in your student
[2573.34 --> 2575.00]  and the joy on their face of it
[2575.00 --> 2576.60]  kind of all coming together,
[2577.08 --> 2579.00]  that's a beautiful thing.
[2579.50 --> 2581.56]  And I love that.
[2583.02 --> 2584.60]  The story of Jonah
[2584.60 --> 2586.62]  is one of those places
[2586.62 --> 2590.06]  that I think might be full of surprise
[2590.06 --> 2591.40]  for us.
[2593.10 --> 2594.68]  What I'm aware of,
[2595.10 --> 2596.80]  especially in Jonah 1,
[2597.26 --> 2599.00]  and then maybe next week, too,
[2599.10 --> 2600.02]  in Jonah 2,
[2600.72 --> 2603.72]  is sometimes that surprise
[2603.72 --> 2606.54]  comes and we're actually
[2606.54 --> 2608.78]  upset by it.
[2608.78 --> 2610.84]  we find it
[2610.84 --> 2612.12]  offensive
[2612.12 --> 2614.04]  because it doesn't fit
[2614.04 --> 2615.48]  our frame of reference
[2615.48 --> 2616.84]  or our understanding,
[2617.06 --> 2617.98]  and that might actually
[2617.98 --> 2618.90]  be what happens
[2618.90 --> 2620.56]  as we look into
[2620.56 --> 2621.48]  Jonah
[2621.48 --> 2622.66]  and Jonah 1,
[2622.78 --> 2623.22]  particularly,
[2623.62 --> 2624.12]  this morning.
[2626.34 --> 2627.76]  Now, to help us
[2627.76 --> 2628.94]  know
[2628.94 --> 2630.46]  when this story
[2630.46 --> 2631.56]  takes place,
[2632.34 --> 2634.44]  we could look at
[2634.44 --> 2635.54]  the book of
[2635.54 --> 2636.66]  2 Kings.
[2636.66 --> 2638.74]  Now, the books
[2638.74 --> 2640.38]  of 1 and 2 Kings
[2640.38 --> 2641.56]  were written
[2641.56 --> 2642.34]  to record
[2642.34 --> 2643.40]  the history
[2643.40 --> 2644.60]  of the kings
[2644.60 --> 2646.90]  that led Israel
[2646.90 --> 2647.66]  and Judah
[2647.66 --> 2649.82]  into Babylonian exile
[2649.82 --> 2651.56]  in the 6th
[2651.56 --> 2652.84]  and late 5th century.
[2653.88 --> 2654.80]  And so it explains
[2654.80 --> 2655.82]  what happened
[2655.82 --> 2656.72]  and the work
[2656.72 --> 2657.54]  of the prophets
[2657.54 --> 2659.46]  to guide Israel
[2659.46 --> 2660.70]  back to God.
[2661.44 --> 2662.76]  And when they refused,
[2663.18 --> 2664.16]  they ended up
[2664.16 --> 2664.98]  in exile.
[2664.98 --> 2666.16]  2 Kings,
[2666.16 --> 2667.24]  14,
[2668.08 --> 2669.02]  verse 25,
[2669.40 --> 2670.22]  tells us
[2670.22 --> 2671.60]  that Jonah,
[2671.90 --> 2673.26]  son of Amittai,
[2673.40 --> 2674.30]  is a prophet
[2674.30 --> 2675.78]  in the northern
[2675.78 --> 2677.16]  kingdom of Israel
[2677.16 --> 2678.44]  and he's from
[2678.44 --> 2679.10]  the city
[2679.10 --> 2680.66]  of Gath-Hefer.
[2681.48 --> 2682.24]  And he prophesies
[2682.96 --> 2684.26]  during the reign
[2684.26 --> 2685.96]  of Jeroboam II,
[2686.44 --> 2687.56]  who is the son
[2687.56 --> 2689.18]  of Jehoash.
[2690.12 --> 2690.40]  Now,
[2690.48 --> 2691.42]  this puts us
[2691.42 --> 2692.20]  sometime
[2692.20 --> 2693.42]  in the window
[2693.42 --> 2694.80]  of 786
[2694.80 --> 2697.88]  to 746 B.C.
[2699.72 --> 2699.96]  Now,
[2700.12 --> 2701.16]  during this time
[2701.16 --> 2703.14]  in the region,
[2703.46 --> 2704.48]  you have
[2704.48 --> 2706.56]  the Assyrian Empire
[2706.56 --> 2708.76]  and that rule
[2708.76 --> 2710.74]  throughout the land
[2710.74 --> 2711.86]  and are constantly
[2711.86 --> 2713.76]  haranguing
[2713.76 --> 2714.86]  the Israelites
[2714.86 --> 2716.66]  and the other
[2716.66 --> 2717.56]  nation states
[2717.56 --> 2718.56]  around them.
[2718.56 --> 2720.18]  In fact,
[2720.30 --> 2720.64]  sometime
[2720.64 --> 2721.98]  in this period,
[2723.68 --> 2724.90]  the Assyrians
[2724.90 --> 2725.82]  have just
[2725.82 --> 2726.60]  crushed
[2726.60 --> 2727.78]  the
[2727.78 --> 2730.54]  Arameans
[2730.54 --> 2732.36]  and destroyed
[2732.36 --> 2733.16]  their capital
[2733.16 --> 2734.40]  city of Damascus.
[2734.52 --> 2734.74]  Actually,
[2734.86 --> 2735.02]  Linda,
[2735.10 --> 2735.42]  can you put
[2735.42 --> 2736.14]  the map up?
[2737.72 --> 2738.58]  I will come
[2738.58 --> 2739.44]  and point at this
[2739.44 --> 2740.08]  in just a moment,
[2740.20 --> 2740.98]  but as I say
[2740.98 --> 2741.78]  these city names,
[2741.88 --> 2742.82]  you might find them.
[2742.82 --> 2744.38]  So,
[2744.44 --> 2745.38]  the Arameans
[2745.38 --> 2746.68]  had regular
[2746.68 --> 2748.00]  border skirmishes
[2748.00 --> 2749.14]  with Israel
[2749.14 --> 2750.92]  and the
[2750.92 --> 2752.36]  Assyrian assault
[2752.36 --> 2753.14]  that destroyed
[2753.14 --> 2753.90]  their capital
[2753.90 --> 2756.48]  put an end
[2756.48 --> 2757.48]  to those
[2757.48 --> 2758.42]  regular skirmishes.
[2759.48 --> 2759.78]  Now,
[2759.84 --> 2760.56]  the Assyrians
[2760.56 --> 2761.22]  also,
[2761.48 --> 2762.28]  at this time,
[2762.68 --> 2763.88]  face a conflict
[2763.88 --> 2764.70]  or a battle
[2764.70 --> 2766.44]  with a nation state
[2766.44 --> 2767.36]  to their north
[2767.36 --> 2768.70]  called Eratu.
[2770.28 --> 2771.10]  And these
[2771.10 --> 2772.02]  two fronts
[2772.02 --> 2772.62]  on the north
[2772.62 --> 2773.40]  and the south
[2773.40 --> 2774.56]  stretched the
[2774.56 --> 2775.66]  Assyrian empire
[2775.66 --> 2776.26]  thin
[2776.26 --> 2777.84]  and led
[2777.84 --> 2779.06]  to internal
[2779.06 --> 2780.36]  political divisions
[2780.36 --> 2782.38]  such that
[2782.38 --> 2783.60]  major cities
[2783.60 --> 2784.58]  within the empire,
[2784.78 --> 2785.96]  cities like Nineveh,
[2786.84 --> 2788.58]  occasionally rebelled
[2788.58 --> 2790.10]  or challenged
[2790.10 --> 2791.66]  for ruling power.
[2793.68 --> 2793.90]  Now,
[2793.98 --> 2794.64]  these two
[2794.64 --> 2795.84]  historical realities
[2795.84 --> 2797.28]  have the impact
[2797.28 --> 2798.20]  then of leading
[2798.20 --> 2799.16]  to relative
[2799.16 --> 2799.92]  peace
[2799.92 --> 2800.66]  and relative
[2800.66 --> 2801.48]  prosperity
[2801.48 --> 2802.72]  for Israel
[2802.72 --> 2803.30]  and Judah
[2803.30 --> 2804.44]  during this time.
[2804.76 --> 2805.10]  And again,
[2805.24 --> 2806.64]  in 2 Kings 14,
[2806.92 --> 2807.72]  you can read about it
[2807.72 --> 2808.22]  at home,
[2808.74 --> 2809.76]  you read that
[2809.76 --> 2810.42]  it is because
[2810.42 --> 2811.82]  of God's mercy
[2811.82 --> 2812.74]  that this happens
[2812.74 --> 2814.36]  and the promises
[2814.36 --> 2815.48]  that God spoke
[2815.48 --> 2816.18]  to the people
[2816.18 --> 2817.34]  through Jonah
[2817.34 --> 2819.04]  to Jeroboam to.
[2821.04 --> 2821.22]  Now,
[2821.26 --> 2822.72]  this historical context
[2822.72 --> 2823.90]  might for us
[2823.90 --> 2824.78]  understand
[2824.78 --> 2825.40]  or help us
[2825.40 --> 2826.10]  understand
[2826.10 --> 2827.46]  why the leaders
[2827.46 --> 2828.22]  and the people
[2828.22 --> 2828.94]  in Nineveh
[2828.94 --> 2830.40]  are so willing
[2830.40 --> 2832.00]  to quickly turn
[2832.00 --> 2833.16]  towards the message
[2833.16 --> 2833.80]  of the Lord,
[2834.22 --> 2834.48]  right?
[2834.54 --> 2834.98]  For them,
[2835.08 --> 2835.50]  the writing
[2835.50 --> 2836.14]  is kind of
[2836.14 --> 2836.74]  on the wall,
[2837.20 --> 2837.50]  right?
[2837.78 --> 2838.70]  That the decline
[2838.70 --> 2839.48]  of their empire
[2839.48 --> 2840.58]  is imminent.
[2841.46 --> 2842.10]  And so,
[2842.22 --> 2843.26]  just to help you see,
[2844.10 --> 2844.62]  first,
[2845.62 --> 2847.28]  here is Nineveh
[2847.28 --> 2849.26]  and generally,
[2849.56 --> 2851.14]  this is the Assyrian Empire
[2851.14 --> 2851.64]  and you have
[2851.64 --> 2853.26]  the Aramian Empire
[2853.26 --> 2854.52]  here with their capital
[2854.52 --> 2855.38]  Damascus
[2855.38 --> 2857.64]  and then up here
[2857.64 --> 2858.94]  around this lake
[2858.94 --> 2860.24]  and then leading
[2860.24 --> 2861.64]  north to the Black Sea
[2861.64 --> 2862.34]  and all the way
[2862.34 --> 2863.10]  down to here,
[2863.64 --> 2864.20]  Tarsus,
[2864.36 --> 2865.28]  kind of like this,
[2865.68 --> 2867.18]  is the Aratu Empire
[2867.18 --> 2867.96]  and so Assyria
[2867.96 --> 2869.06]  kind of in the middle
[2869.06 --> 2870.46]  facing these challenges.
[2871.18 --> 2871.62]  Here,
[2871.74 --> 2872.66]  if you are familiar
[2872.66 --> 2873.28]  with the Bible,
[2873.44 --> 2875.24]  is the city of Babylon.
[2875.58 --> 2876.88]  This is the next empire
[2876.88 --> 2877.86]  that will come in
[2877.86 --> 2879.06]  and take over.
[2879.78 --> 2880.38]  Down here,
[2880.52 --> 2881.96]  you have Samaria,
[2882.12 --> 2882.76]  which is the capital
[2882.76 --> 2883.40]  of Israel
[2883.40 --> 2884.16]  when the kingdoms
[2884.16 --> 2884.72]  are split,
[2884.92 --> 2885.36]  Jerusalem,
[2885.68 --> 2886.40]  which is the capital
[2886.40 --> 2886.94]  of Judah,
[2887.46 --> 2888.60]  the port in Joppa
[2888.60 --> 2890.14]  that Noah,
[2890.62 --> 2892.50]  or that Jonah fled to
[2892.50 --> 2893.60]  and then,
[2893.82 --> 2894.30]  if we move
[2894.30 --> 2895.26]  to this other map,
[2895.64 --> 2896.22]  this is the map
[2896.22 --> 2897.38]  of the Mediterranean Sea.
[2897.78 --> 2898.18]  You can see it
[2898.18 --> 2898.62]  all around here,
[2898.72 --> 2898.98]  Italy,
[2899.18 --> 2899.76]  very famously,
[2899.92 --> 2900.28]  right there.
[2900.72 --> 2901.62]  So Joppa port,
[2902.36 --> 2902.96]  Tarshish,
[2903.10 --> 2903.62]  it is thought,
[2903.70 --> 2904.86]  is all the way
[2904.86 --> 2905.78]  over here.
[2906.20 --> 2907.48]  That's the Strait
[2907.48 --> 2908.24]  of Gibraltar,
[2908.64 --> 2909.20]  if any of you
[2909.20 --> 2910.36]  have been out
[2910.36 --> 2911.10]  down that way.
[2911.54 --> 2912.08]  So this,
[2912.18 --> 2912.64]  Tarshish,
[2912.74 --> 2913.88]  is kind of
[2913.88 --> 2915.18]  the end of the world
[2915.18 --> 2917.16]  at that time
[2917.16 --> 2918.12]  and that matters.
[2918.40 --> 2919.00]  That's a point.
[2920.44 --> 2921.58]  So you keep
[2921.58 --> 2922.86]  these place names
[2922.86 --> 2923.48]  in mind.
[2924.16 --> 2924.70]  Maybe you can
[2924.70 --> 2925.42]  even leave it up
[2925.42 --> 2926.68]  as we go through.
[2928.88 --> 2929.16]  Now,
[2929.16 --> 2931.48]  one of the other,
[2931.76 --> 2932.70]  I think,
[2932.90 --> 2934.16]  interesting things
[2934.16 --> 2935.36]  about Jonah,
[2935.80 --> 2936.10]  right,
[2936.16 --> 2937.86]  is that even though
[2937.86 --> 2939.26]  we place this
[2939.26 --> 2940.58]  in our Bibles
[2940.58 --> 2941.98]  in the minor prophets,
[2942.60 --> 2943.42]  and that even though
[2943.42 --> 2944.62]  Jonah is a prophet,
[2945.80 --> 2947.58]  it's very likely
[2947.58 --> 2948.58]  that Jonah
[2948.58 --> 2949.46]  didn't actually
[2949.46 --> 2950.18]  write this book
[2950.18 --> 2950.68]  himself,
[2950.90 --> 2951.72]  right?
[2951.72 --> 2952.36]  He's not telling
[2952.36 --> 2953.98]  his own story.
[2953.98 --> 2956.60]  And you can probably
[2956.60 --> 2957.32]  also see,
[2957.54 --> 2958.42]  if you have familiarity
[2958.42 --> 2959.82]  with the other prophets,
[2959.92 --> 2960.76]  especially if your Bibles
[2960.76 --> 2961.60]  are open,
[2962.04 --> 2962.98]  Jonah isn't written
[2962.98 --> 2964.06]  in the same sort
[2964.06 --> 2964.64]  of format
[2964.64 --> 2965.36]  or structure
[2965.36 --> 2966.24]  as the other
[2966.24 --> 2967.30]  minor prophets.
[2967.48 --> 2968.36]  The other minor prophets
[2968.36 --> 2969.36]  look more like
[2969.36 --> 2970.62]  chapter 2 of Jonah
[2970.62 --> 2971.58]  than the rest,
[2971.64 --> 2971.78]  right?
[2971.82 --> 2972.16]  They're written
[2972.16 --> 2973.40]  in a poetic form,
[2973.78 --> 2974.48]  they're written
[2974.48 --> 2976.76]  in a prophetic poetry,
[2976.92 --> 2977.50]  whereas Jonah
[2977.50 --> 2978.64]  is much more narrative,
[2978.98 --> 2979.94]  it's more of a story.
[2980.66 --> 2981.20]  In fact,
[2981.36 --> 2982.68]  Jonah looks more
[2982.68 --> 2984.40]  like the stories
[2984.40 --> 2985.50]  of Elijah
[2985.50 --> 2986.76]  or Elisha.
[2987.78 --> 2988.30]  Elijah,
[2988.62 --> 2989.54]  you might remember,
[2989.68 --> 2990.76]  he's famous
[2990.76 --> 2992.12]  for his story
[2992.12 --> 2993.12]  of the conflict
[2993.12 --> 2995.54]  with the 500 prophets
[2995.54 --> 2996.10]  of Baal,
[2996.70 --> 2997.00]  right?
[2997.06 --> 2997.90]  Or Elisha
[2997.90 --> 2999.32]  might be most famous
[2999.32 --> 3000.06]  for his story
[3000.06 --> 3000.62]  with the widow
[3000.62 --> 3001.98]  and her young son
[3001.98 --> 3003.06]  and the jar of oil
[3003.06 --> 3003.84]  that lasted
[3003.84 --> 3005.22]  throughout the famine.
[3006.50 --> 3007.64]  And in those cases
[3007.64 --> 3009.38]  of Elijah and Elisha
[3009.38 --> 3010.98]  and the narrative stories
[3010.98 --> 3011.60]  of the prophets,
[3012.52 --> 3013.88]  the normal pattern
[3013.88 --> 3015.82]  is for the story
[3015.82 --> 3016.94]  to emphasize
[3016.94 --> 3018.24]  the actions
[3018.24 --> 3019.36]  of the prophet
[3019.36 --> 3020.90]  to reveal
[3020.90 --> 3022.52]  their special relationships
[3022.52 --> 3023.16]  to God.
[3023.74 --> 3024.50]  To show
[3024.50 --> 3025.36]  that the prophet
[3025.36 --> 3027.20]  has an exemplary
[3027.20 --> 3028.90]  religious commitment
[3028.90 --> 3029.82]  and devotion,
[3030.56 --> 3030.72]  right?
[3030.76 --> 3031.24]  To show
[3031.24 --> 3032.78]  how good he is
[3032.78 --> 3033.84]  and his behavior is
[3033.84 --> 3035.44]  and how it comes together
[3035.44 --> 3035.84]  then,
[3035.88 --> 3036.60]  all those things,
[3036.72 --> 3037.92]  to reveal
[3037.92 --> 3039.82]  something about
[3039.82 --> 3040.70]  the character
[3040.70 --> 3041.52]  of God
[3041.52 --> 3042.22]  to the people
[3042.22 --> 3043.20]  and his will
[3043.20 --> 3043.90]  for them
[3043.90 --> 3044.90]  in their life.
[3046.40 --> 3046.84]  Jonah
[3046.84 --> 3049.02]  flips that script
[3049.02 --> 3050.30]  almost entirely,
[3050.76 --> 3052.12]  right?
[3052.14 --> 3053.14]  In this story,
[3053.68 --> 3054.64]  it is the people
[3054.64 --> 3055.78]  of other nations
[3055.78 --> 3057.10]  who do good,
[3057.94 --> 3058.66]  right?
[3058.70 --> 3060.06]  It's the pagans
[3060.06 --> 3061.88]  who change their ways
[3061.88 --> 3063.54]  and the prophet,
[3064.00 --> 3064.34]  Jonah,
[3064.52 --> 3065.80]  who's the problem one,
[3065.80 --> 3066.98]  right?
[3066.98 --> 3068.16]  The other nations,
[3068.40 --> 3069.18]  the Gentiles,
[3069.34 --> 3070.84]  the men on the boat,
[3071.34 --> 3074.16]  look at verse 14,
[3076.56 --> 3076.78]  right?
[3076.84 --> 3078.20]  They cried out
[3078.20 --> 3079.48]  to the Lord
[3079.48 --> 3081.54]  and at the end
[3081.54 --> 3082.20]  of the chapter,
[3082.50 --> 3082.70]  right,
[3082.78 --> 3084.10]  it seems to me
[3084.10 --> 3085.36]  that they're converted,
[3086.18 --> 3086.42]  right?
[3086.48 --> 3087.00]  At the end
[3087.00 --> 3087.50]  of the chapter,
[3087.74 --> 3089.80]  verse 16,
[3090.58 --> 3091.62]  the men greatly
[3091.62 --> 3092.66]  feared the Lord
[3092.66 --> 3093.32]  and they offered
[3093.32 --> 3093.94]  a sacrifice
[3093.94 --> 3094.66]  to the Lord
[3094.66 --> 3096.06]  and made vows
[3096.06 --> 3096.76]  to him.
[3097.68 --> 3098.40]  At the end
[3098.40 --> 3099.20]  of chapter 3,
[3099.38 --> 3099.96]  we'll see
[3099.96 --> 3102.56]  that the Ninevites
[3102.56 --> 3103.82]  believed God.
[3104.70 --> 3105.34]  The king,
[3105.50 --> 3106.22]  he repents
[3106.22 --> 3107.30]  in sackcloth
[3107.30 --> 3108.20]  and dust
[3108.20 --> 3109.22]  and he throws himself
[3109.22 --> 3109.82]  on the mercy
[3109.82 --> 3110.38]  of God.
[3111.56 --> 3112.26]  The point
[3112.26 --> 3113.28]  in this story
[3113.28 --> 3114.58]  is that Jonah
[3114.58 --> 3116.24]  isn't the good character.
[3117.44 --> 3117.94]  He's not
[3117.94 --> 3119.18]  the exemplary one.
[3119.26 --> 3119.92]  He's not the one
[3119.92 --> 3120.32]  you're supposed
[3120.32 --> 3121.10]  to see and go,
[3121.24 --> 3121.48]  yeah,
[3121.66 --> 3122.68]  I want to be like him.
[3122.68 --> 3125.02]  He's a poor prophet.
[3126.30 --> 3126.62]  In fact,
[3126.66 --> 3127.40]  there's one writer
[3127.40 --> 3128.58]  who calls
[3128.58 --> 3129.72]  the book of Jonah
[3129.72 --> 3130.54]  a, quote,
[3130.68 --> 3131.94]  gentle parody
[3131.94 --> 3133.60]  of traditional prophecy.
[3136.68 --> 3137.64]  And I underscore
[3137.64 --> 3138.44]  this point
[3138.44 --> 3140.20]  because the thing is
[3140.20 --> 3141.12]  most of us
[3141.12 --> 3142.34]  know the children's
[3142.34 --> 3143.06]  Bible version
[3143.06 --> 3144.06]  of the story.
[3145.66 --> 3146.74]  But that's not actually
[3146.74 --> 3147.58]  what's happening here.
[3148.50 --> 3148.98]  And so,
[3149.12 --> 3149.88]  you should be
[3149.88 --> 3150.96]  asking yourselves,
[3151.52 --> 3151.66]  well,
[3151.72 --> 3152.30]  then why?
[3152.68 --> 3154.02]  Why is this
[3154.02 --> 3154.60]  in the Bible?
[3154.74 --> 3155.78]  Why is this story
[3155.78 --> 3156.56]  important?
[3156.66 --> 3157.18]  Why does it have
[3157.18 --> 3158.14]  to be there at all?
[3158.68 --> 3158.76]  Right?
[3158.88 --> 3159.40]  Specifically,
[3159.72 --> 3160.96]  what does God
[3160.96 --> 3162.98]  want a post-exilic
[3162.98 --> 3164.14]  Judah to learn
[3164.14 --> 3165.50]  about God's
[3165.50 --> 3166.18]  relationship
[3166.18 --> 3167.30]  to the world
[3167.30 --> 3168.00]  generally
[3168.00 --> 3169.50]  and also
[3169.50 --> 3170.56]  his relationship
[3170.56 --> 3171.50]  to his chosen
[3171.50 --> 3172.64]  people specifically?
[3173.80 --> 3174.24]  And how does
[3174.24 --> 3175.08]  the book of Jonah
[3175.08 --> 3175.90]  open our eyes
[3175.90 --> 3176.30]  to that?
[3177.86 --> 3178.36]  Now,
[3178.42 --> 3178.98]  I'm going to
[3178.98 --> 3179.98]  suggest to you
[3179.98 --> 3180.96]  that the answer
[3180.96 --> 3182.56]  is threefold
[3182.56 --> 3183.18]  and they all
[3183.18 --> 3184.22]  relate to each other
[3184.22 --> 3184.70]  and kind of
[3184.70 --> 3185.52]  build on each other
[3185.52 --> 3186.54]  and they are themes
[3186.54 --> 3187.46]  that we will return
[3187.46 --> 3188.48]  to throughout
[3188.48 --> 3189.96]  this quick series.
[3190.62 --> 3191.18]  This is going to
[3191.18 --> 3191.76]  be the frame
[3191.76 --> 3192.78]  for our sort of
[3192.78 --> 3193.44]  four parts
[3193.44 --> 3194.02]  together.
[3195.02 --> 3195.70]  And so,
[3195.82 --> 3196.74]  if you're a note taker,
[3196.88 --> 3197.72]  three points here.
[3198.24 --> 3198.78]  And we'll go through
[3198.78 --> 3199.18]  them quickly
[3199.18 --> 3200.18]  because we'll return
[3200.18 --> 3200.88]  to them throughout.
[3201.20 --> 3201.62]  First,
[3202.28 --> 3202.64]  Jonah
[3202.64 --> 3203.82]  is about
[3203.82 --> 3204.70]  election.
[3204.70 --> 3206.28]  Now,
[3206.36 --> 3206.78]  election
[3206.78 --> 3208.22]  is the Bible's
[3208.22 --> 3209.34]  word for God
[3209.34 --> 3210.20]  choosing some
[3210.20 --> 3210.94]  for salvation.
[3212.16 --> 3213.20]  And part of
[3213.20 --> 3213.64]  what Jonah
[3213.64 --> 3214.56]  teaches us
[3214.56 --> 3215.76]  is that
[3215.76 --> 3216.90]  God's election
[3216.90 --> 3218.32]  is bigger
[3218.32 --> 3219.26]  than you
[3219.26 --> 3220.34]  think it should
[3220.34 --> 3220.68]  be.
[3222.94 --> 3223.58]  Do you hear
[3223.58 --> 3224.02]  what I'm saying?
[3225.08 --> 3226.48]  God chooses
[3226.48 --> 3227.58]  broader
[3227.58 --> 3229.12]  than you
[3229.12 --> 3229.94]  think is
[3229.94 --> 3230.64]  wise.
[3230.64 --> 3235.02]  second thing,
[3236.04 --> 3236.34]  Jonah
[3236.34 --> 3237.12]  is about
[3237.12 --> 3237.50]  God's
[3237.50 --> 3238.16]  justice,
[3238.76 --> 3239.42]  specifically
[3239.42 --> 3240.50]  about how
[3240.50 --> 3241.52]  God's justice
[3241.52 --> 3242.24]  cuts
[3242.24 --> 3243.54]  both ways.
[3244.98 --> 3245.58]  And therefore,
[3246.64 --> 3247.52]  God's justice
[3247.52 --> 3248.58]  excludes
[3248.58 --> 3249.46]  from election
[3249.46 --> 3250.48]  those whom
[3250.48 --> 3251.22]  you think
[3251.22 --> 3252.02]  should be
[3252.02 --> 3252.50]  included.
[3254.16 --> 3254.92]  Again,
[3255.04 --> 3255.34]  do you hear
[3255.34 --> 3256.98]  what's going
[3256.98 --> 3257.38]  on here?
[3258.16 --> 3258.34]  Right?
[3258.70 --> 3259.26]  Our
[3259.26 --> 3260.38]  presumptions,
[3260.38 --> 3261.68]  our preconceived
[3261.68 --> 3262.30]  ideas,
[3262.56 --> 3263.72]  our preferences
[3263.72 --> 3264.94]  are being
[3264.94 --> 3265.64]  totally challenged
[3265.64 --> 3266.40]  and undermined.
[3268.94 --> 3269.44]  And third,
[3270.76 --> 3271.56]  Jonah
[3271.56 --> 3272.22]  is about
[3272.22 --> 3272.86]  God's
[3272.86 --> 3273.62]  mercy,
[3273.88 --> 3274.70]  but specifically
[3274.70 --> 3276.12]  how God's
[3276.12 --> 3276.54]  mercy
[3276.54 --> 3278.04]  is necessary
[3278.04 --> 3278.98]  for both
[3278.98 --> 3279.40]  of those
[3279.40 --> 3280.22]  two other
[3280.22 --> 3280.56]  things,
[3280.66 --> 3281.28]  necessary for
[3281.28 --> 3281.86]  his election
[3281.86 --> 3282.94]  and for
[3282.94 --> 3284.40]  his justice.
[3285.64 --> 3285.86]  Now,
[3285.90 --> 3286.18]  this is
[3286.18 --> 3286.62]  highlighted,
[3287.14 --> 3287.96]  for instance,
[3288.08 --> 3288.68]  by Jonah's
[3288.68 --> 3289.98]  glaring hypocrisy
[3289.98 --> 3290.52]  and you
[3290.52 --> 3290.80]  will get
[3290.80 --> 3291.18]  to see
[3291.18 --> 3291.78]  that next
[3291.78 --> 3292.10]  week.
[3292.88 --> 3293.24]  Josh
[3293.24 --> 3293.64]  is going
[3293.64 --> 3293.86]  to be
[3293.86 --> 3294.12]  preaching
[3294.12 --> 3294.62]  for us
[3294.62 --> 3295.04]  on chapter
[3295.04 --> 3296.12]  two and
[3296.12 --> 3296.46]  he's going
[3296.46 --> 3297.08]  to lean
[3297.08 --> 3297.78]  into this
[3297.78 --> 3298.88]  for us
[3298.88 --> 3299.08]  there.
[3299.16 --> 3299.38]  But let
[3299.38 --> 3300.04]  me make
[3300.04 --> 3300.86]  this point
[3300.86 --> 3301.26]  by way
[3301.26 --> 3301.82]  of another
[3301.82 --> 3302.46]  example.
[3304.54 --> 3305.14]  Justice
[3305.14 --> 3307.04]  is an
[3307.04 --> 3307.84]  act of
[3307.84 --> 3308.36]  God's
[3308.36 --> 3308.96]  character
[3308.96 --> 3309.50]  trait,
[3309.66 --> 3309.82]  right?
[3309.86 --> 3310.12]  It's a
[3310.12 --> 3310.70]  living out
[3310.70 --> 3311.24]  of God's
[3311.24 --> 3311.64]  character
[3311.64 --> 3312.74]  of being
[3312.74 --> 3313.28]  just.
[3314.16 --> 3314.68]  So God
[3314.68 --> 3315.36]  is just,
[3315.50 --> 3316.06]  therefore he
[3316.06 --> 3316.42]  acts
[3316.42 --> 3317.36]  justly,
[3317.36 --> 3318.36]  he provides
[3318.36 --> 3319.36]  justice.
[3320.42 --> 3320.98]  And same
[3320.98 --> 3321.48]  thing with
[3321.48 --> 3321.82]  God's
[3321.82 --> 3322.36]  mercy,
[3322.52 --> 3322.68]  right?
[3322.98 --> 3323.70]  Mercy is
[3323.70 --> 3324.56]  because God
[3324.56 --> 3325.62]  is merciful.
[3326.88 --> 3327.26]  And what we
[3327.26 --> 3327.82]  need to hear
[3327.82 --> 3329.14]  is that God
[3329.14 --> 3330.06]  is not
[3330.06 --> 3332.06]  self-contradictory,
[3333.86 --> 3334.00]  right?
[3334.38 --> 3336.32]  That God
[3336.32 --> 3336.78]  is,
[3338.18 --> 3338.90]  those two
[3338.90 --> 3340.02]  aspects of
[3340.02 --> 3340.44]  who God
[3340.44 --> 3340.96]  is and
[3340.96 --> 3341.28]  what he
[3341.28 --> 3341.76]  does do
[3341.76 --> 3342.44]  not contradict
[3342.44 --> 3343.10]  each other.
[3343.52 --> 3344.18]  Part of
[3344.18 --> 3344.58]  God's
[3344.58 --> 3345.14]  aseity,
[3345.42 --> 3345.66]  which is
[3345.66 --> 3346.64]  the theological
[3346.64 --> 3347.18]  way of
[3347.18 --> 3347.60]  saying his
[3347.60 --> 3348.46]  simplicity,
[3349.16 --> 3349.92]  means that
[3349.92 --> 3350.78]  God cannot
[3350.78 --> 3351.90]  contain in
[3351.90 --> 3352.50]  his being
[3352.50 --> 3353.48]  contradictions.
[3354.66 --> 3355.22]  And so,
[3355.44 --> 3355.86]  what this
[3355.86 --> 3356.26]  means for
[3356.26 --> 3356.78]  us is that
[3356.78 --> 3357.34]  you cannot
[3357.34 --> 3358.28]  put justice
[3358.28 --> 3359.04]  and mercy
[3359.04 --> 3359.96]  at odds
[3359.96 --> 3360.48]  to each
[3360.48 --> 3360.78]  other.
[3361.66 --> 3362.22]  Because
[3362.22 --> 3362.42]  they're
[3362.42 --> 3363.06]  characteristics
[3363.06 --> 3363.66]  of God
[3363.66 --> 3363.94]  and who
[3363.94 --> 3364.40]  he is.
[3364.90 --> 3365.54]  They work
[3365.54 --> 3366.18]  in tandem.
[3366.68 --> 3366.98]  They work
[3366.98 --> 3367.64]  together
[3367.64 --> 3368.96]  towards his
[3368.96 --> 3369.74]  choosing and
[3369.74 --> 3370.54]  towards his
[3370.54 --> 3371.30]  election.
[3371.48 --> 3371.60]  So,
[3371.96 --> 3372.34]  practically,
[3372.56 --> 3372.88]  what is this?
[3373.02 --> 3373.56]  Sometimes,
[3373.56 --> 3374.36]  you might
[3374.36 --> 3374.90]  hear people
[3374.90 --> 3375.26]  say,
[3376.50 --> 3376.82]  you know,
[3376.94 --> 3377.24]  when it
[3377.24 --> 3377.90]  comes to
[3377.90 --> 3378.56]  choosing between
[3378.56 --> 3379.32]  justice and
[3379.32 --> 3379.68]  mercy,
[3379.90 --> 3380.92]  I'm going to
[3380.92 --> 3381.64]  err on the
[3381.64 --> 3382.20]  side of
[3382.20 --> 3382.58]  mercy.
[3383.54 --> 3383.82]  Or we'll
[3383.82 --> 3384.26]  put it another
[3384.26 --> 3384.42]  way,
[3384.48 --> 3385.44]  sometimes using
[3385.44 --> 3386.04]  New Testament
[3386.04 --> 3386.62]  language,
[3387.14 --> 3387.42]  we say,
[3387.58 --> 3388.04]  people go,
[3388.28 --> 3388.50]  you know,
[3388.58 --> 3389.30]  there is grace
[3389.30 --> 3390.02]  and there is
[3390.02 --> 3390.46]  truth,
[3391.28 --> 3392.08]  and I want to
[3392.08 --> 3392.64]  err on the
[3392.64 --> 3393.00]  side of
[3393.00 --> 3393.42]  grace.
[3395.24 --> 3395.92]  Part of
[3395.92 --> 3396.24]  what Jonah
[3396.24 --> 3396.76]  is teaching
[3396.76 --> 3397.14]  us,
[3397.22 --> 3397.74]  I think,
[3397.80 --> 3398.16]  is that
[3398.16 --> 3399.22]  those are
[3399.22 --> 3399.64]  false
[3399.64 --> 3400.58]  dichotomies.
[3401.76 --> 3402.36]  That justice
[3402.36 --> 3402.90]  and mercy
[3402.90 --> 3403.74]  are together
[3403.74 --> 3404.82]  in God
[3404.82 --> 3405.82]  and therefore
[3405.82 --> 3407.18]  ought to be
[3407.18 --> 3407.76]  together in
[3407.76 --> 3408.34]  his people.
[3409.74 --> 3410.34]  Grace and
[3410.34 --> 3411.58]  truth don't
[3411.58 --> 3412.54]  contradict each
[3412.54 --> 3412.80]  other.
[3413.24 --> 3413.76]  They come
[3413.76 --> 3414.24]  together.
[3415.30 --> 3416.02]  And at the
[3416.02 --> 3416.36]  end,
[3416.54 --> 3417.54]  what we'll see,
[3417.80 --> 3418.56]  hopefully every
[3418.56 --> 3418.96]  week,
[3419.12 --> 3419.90]  is that they
[3419.90 --> 3420.60]  come together
[3420.60 --> 3421.32]  in a man,
[3421.52 --> 3422.50]  a man named
[3422.50 --> 3423.32]  Jesus.
[3423.98 --> 3424.14]  Right?
[3424.20 --> 3424.84]  In Jesus,
[3425.14 --> 3426.18]  grace and
[3426.18 --> 3427.02]  truth are
[3427.02 --> 3428.34]  perfectly revealed
[3428.34 --> 3429.32]  in union
[3429.32 --> 3429.72]  together.
[3429.72 --> 3430.72]  in the gospel
[3430.72 --> 3431.50]  of Jesus,
[3432.10 --> 3433.34]  justice and
[3433.34 --> 3434.42]  mercy are
[3434.42 --> 3435.46]  hand-in-glove
[3435.46 --> 3436.52]  attributes of
[3436.52 --> 3437.16]  God's work
[3437.16 --> 3438.04]  in the world.
[3438.84 --> 3439.74]  And in fact,
[3439.86 --> 3440.56]  what happens
[3440.56 --> 3440.94]  when you
[3440.94 --> 3442.00]  overemphasize
[3442.00 --> 3443.38]  one at the
[3443.38 --> 3444.08]  expense or
[3444.08 --> 3444.86]  the cost of
[3444.86 --> 3445.50]  the other,
[3446.10 --> 3446.26]  right,
[3446.38 --> 3447.22]  that's when
[3447.22 --> 3447.96]  hypocrisy
[3447.96 --> 3448.44]  comes.
[3449.72 --> 3450.46]  So when you
[3450.46 --> 3450.62]  say,
[3450.76 --> 3451.22]  I'm going to
[3451.22 --> 3451.74]  lean on
[3451.74 --> 3452.90]  justice right
[3452.90 --> 3453.18]  now,
[3453.24 --> 3453.74]  that's when
[3453.74 --> 3454.56]  hypocrisy
[3454.56 --> 3454.98]  comes.
[3455.16 --> 3455.60]  Or when you
[3455.60 --> 3455.74]  say,
[3455.80 --> 3456.10]  I'm going to
[3456.10 --> 3456.96]  choose mercy,
[3457.20 --> 3458.04]  that's when
[3458.04 --> 3458.78]  hypocrisy
[3458.78 --> 3459.64]  comes.
[3461.32 --> 3461.56]  Now,
[3461.72 --> 3462.78]  I think that
[3462.78 --> 3463.28]  we will see
[3463.28 --> 3464.10]  all of these
[3464.10 --> 3464.82]  three themes
[3464.82 --> 3465.62]  throughout each
[3465.62 --> 3466.02]  chapter,
[3466.14 --> 3466.46]  but there will
[3466.46 --> 3467.38]  be particular,
[3468.40 --> 3470.10]  a unique focus
[3470.10 --> 3471.00]  in each one.
[3471.38 --> 3471.92]  I think that
[3471.92 --> 3472.74]  unique focus
[3472.74 --> 3473.66]  in chapter one
[3473.66 --> 3475.16]  is that first
[3475.16 --> 3475.86]  theme.
[3476.56 --> 3476.74]  Right?
[3476.78 --> 3477.22]  That the book
[3477.22 --> 3477.98]  of Jonah is
[3477.98 --> 3478.90]  about election,
[3479.24 --> 3480.34]  but that election
[3480.34 --> 3481.84]  is bigger than
[3481.84 --> 3482.68]  you think it
[3482.68 --> 3483.24]  should be.
[3484.10 --> 3485.16]  It was definitely
[3485.16 --> 3485.92]  bigger than what
[3485.92 --> 3486.60]  Jonah thought it
[3486.60 --> 3487.02]  should be.
[3487.02 --> 3488.88]  right?
[3488.94 --> 3489.58]  In the story,
[3490.48 --> 3491.82]  Jonah is
[3491.82 --> 3492.90]  called by God
[3492.90 --> 3494.06]  to leave his
[3494.06 --> 3495.04]  home and to
[3495.04 --> 3496.84]  go up to
[3496.84 --> 3497.54]  Nineveh.
[3497.66 --> 3498.62]  So he's
[3498.62 --> 3499.30]  living here
[3499.30 --> 3499.88]  somewhere,
[3500.82 --> 3501.04]  right,
[3501.10 --> 3502.12]  and to go up
[3502.12 --> 3503.22]  to Nineveh
[3503.22 --> 3504.56]  and preach
[3504.56 --> 3505.24]  to them
[3505.24 --> 3506.66]  the looming
[3506.66 --> 3507.66]  judgments and
[3507.66 --> 3508.74]  the need to
[3508.74 --> 3510.34]  find forgiveness.
[3510.34 --> 3512.88]  and he's
[3512.88 --> 3513.62]  called to go
[3513.62 --> 3515.20]  and Jonah
[3515.20 --> 3516.28]  doesn't
[3516.28 --> 3517.50]  like it.
[3519.00 --> 3519.48]  Right?
[3519.52 --> 3519.98]  And he doesn't
[3519.98 --> 3520.66]  like it for a
[3520.66 --> 3521.48]  couple reasons
[3521.48 --> 3523.48]  and we know
[3523.48 --> 3523.96]  this because
[3523.96 --> 3525.00]  at the end of
[3525.00 --> 3525.32]  the book,
[3525.44 --> 3526.10]  Jonah says,
[3526.42 --> 3526.80]  I didn't want
[3526.80 --> 3527.30]  to come here
[3527.30 --> 3528.18]  because I knew
[3528.18 --> 3529.14]  and know that
[3529.14 --> 3530.02]  you are gracious
[3530.02 --> 3530.88]  and compassionate,
[3531.08 --> 3531.88]  slow to anger
[3531.88 --> 3532.76]  and abounding
[3532.76 --> 3533.14]  in love.
[3533.26 --> 3534.06]  Jonah knows
[3534.06 --> 3534.80]  that God is
[3534.80 --> 3535.40]  going to forgive
[3535.40 --> 3535.98]  these people
[3535.98 --> 3536.66]  if they ask
[3536.66 --> 3537.62]  for it and he
[3537.62 --> 3538.18]  doesn't think
[3538.18 --> 3538.66]  they deserve
[3538.66 --> 3539.34]  to be forgiven
[3539.34 --> 3541.14]  because remember
[3541.14 --> 3541.86]  what has happened.
[3542.14 --> 3542.96]  They are,
[3543.36 --> 3543.94]  the people of
[3543.94 --> 3544.24]  Nineveh,
[3544.36 --> 3545.08]  the Assyrians
[3545.08 --> 3546.34]  are their enemies.
[3546.60 --> 3546.96]  They've been
[3546.96 --> 3548.02]  for generations
[3548.02 --> 3549.32]  battling them
[3549.32 --> 3550.02]  and forcing them
[3550.02 --> 3550.74]  and persecuting
[3550.74 --> 3551.60]  and killing them
[3551.60 --> 3552.66]  and Jonah doesn't
[3552.66 --> 3553.76]  think they deserve
[3553.76 --> 3554.54]  forgiveness.
[3556.88 --> 3557.92]  And instead
[3557.92 --> 3559.04]  of seeing
[3559.04 --> 3560.04]  God's offer
[3560.04 --> 3560.90]  to the Ninevites
[3560.90 --> 3561.68]  as a miracle
[3561.68 --> 3562.66]  of grace,
[3563.26 --> 3564.90]  he gets angry
[3564.90 --> 3565.44]  with God.
[3566.88 --> 3567.74]  He wants
[3567.74 --> 3568.50]  justice
[3568.50 --> 3570.42]  at the expense
[3570.42 --> 3571.04]  of mercy.
[3572.14 --> 3572.58]  You see how
[3572.58 --> 3573.20]  he separated
[3573.20 --> 3573.76]  those things?
[3574.92 --> 3575.54]  He wants
[3575.54 --> 3576.32]  revenge.
[3577.28 --> 3577.56]  Justice
[3577.56 --> 3578.36]  at the expense
[3578.36 --> 3579.18]  of mercy
[3579.18 --> 3580.30]  is probably
[3580.30 --> 3581.40]  better defined
[3581.40 --> 3582.56]  as revenge.
[3584.58 --> 3585.22]  And he,
[3585.44 --> 3585.72]  Jonah,
[3585.88 --> 3586.42]  wants to be
[3586.42 --> 3586.84]  the one
[3586.84 --> 3587.88]  who decides
[3587.88 --> 3588.94]  who's in
[3588.94 --> 3590.34]  and who's out.
[3590.54 --> 3591.00]  He wants
[3591.00 --> 3591.66]  to be the one
[3591.66 --> 3592.84]  who will receive
[3592.84 --> 3593.36]  mercy
[3593.36 --> 3594.84]  and to define
[3594.84 --> 3595.58]  who won't
[3595.58 --> 3597.12]  receive mercy.
[3597.12 --> 3597.16]  mercy.
[3597.76 --> 3598.24]  Instead,
[3598.78 --> 3598.98]  right,
[3599.08 --> 3599.66]  Jonah wants
[3599.66 --> 3600.32]  God to wipe
[3600.32 --> 3600.72]  them out.
[3600.80 --> 3601.22]  He says,
[3601.62 --> 3602.20]  you are supposed
[3602.20 --> 3602.68]  to be the
[3602.68 --> 3603.48]  protector of
[3603.48 --> 3604.10]  Israel
[3604.10 --> 3605.00]  and Israel
[3605.00 --> 3605.58]  alone.
[3606.04 --> 3606.56]  And so,
[3606.76 --> 3607.98]  in that anger,
[3608.16 --> 3608.74]  he runs.
[3609.88 --> 3610.52]  He runs
[3610.52 --> 3611.16]  to the coast
[3611.16 --> 3611.86]  to Joppa
[3611.86 --> 3612.58]  and he boards
[3612.58 --> 3613.08]  a ship
[3613.08 --> 3614.88]  and he flees
[3614.88 --> 3616.08]  to Tarshish.
[3617.12 --> 3618.06]  He's trying
[3618.06 --> 3618.64]  to flee
[3618.64 --> 3619.52]  God's plan,
[3619.70 --> 3620.68]  trying to flee
[3620.68 --> 3622.20]  God's presence.
[3622.42 --> 3622.98]  And remember,
[3623.14 --> 3624.20]  you see Tarshish
[3624.20 --> 3625.02]  on the far
[3625.02 --> 3626.16]  western side
[3626.16 --> 3626.84]  of the Mediterranean
[3626.84 --> 3627.12]  Sea.
[3627.22 --> 3628.06]  This is the
[3628.06 --> 3628.98]  end of the
[3628.98 --> 3629.32]  world.
[3630.44 --> 3631.12]  It's about as
[3631.12 --> 3631.98]  far away
[3631.98 --> 3633.40]  from the
[3633.40 --> 3634.22]  place of
[3634.22 --> 3635.22]  God that
[3635.22 --> 3635.82]  Jonah,
[3636.12 --> 3636.74]  the place
[3636.74 --> 3637.24]  where God
[3637.24 --> 3638.10]  is known
[3638.10 --> 3638.94]  to the people
[3638.94 --> 3639.44]  that Jonah
[3639.44 --> 3639.92]  can get.
[3639.92 --> 3641.80]  Now,
[3641.94 --> 3643.90]  at this time,
[3644.26 --> 3645.44]  a lot of
[3645.44 --> 3647.26]  people believed
[3647.26 --> 3648.22]  that the
[3648.22 --> 3649.28]  gods were
[3649.28 --> 3650.44]  contained to
[3650.44 --> 3651.10]  a particular
[3651.10 --> 3652.52]  area or
[3652.52 --> 3652.84]  they were
[3652.84 --> 3653.64]  tied to
[3653.64 --> 3654.32]  a particular
[3654.32 --> 3655.20]  region.
[3655.98 --> 3656.46]  And it's
[3656.46 --> 3657.50]  possible that
[3657.50 --> 3658.50]  Jonah was
[3658.50 --> 3659.18]  just trying
[3659.18 --> 3660.12]  to escape
[3660.12 --> 3661.04]  the region
[3661.04 --> 3662.02]  of Yahweh,
[3663.20 --> 3664.06]  even though
[3664.06 --> 3665.04]  Jonah himself
[3665.04 --> 3665.90]  realizes and
[3665.90 --> 3666.30]  knows that
[3666.30 --> 3667.02]  that's impossible.
[3667.68 --> 3668.26]  He says to
[3668.26 --> 3668.74]  the sailors
[3668.74 --> 3669.52]  in verse 9,
[3669.64 --> 3669.88]  he says,
[3669.92 --> 3671.02]  I am a
[3671.02 --> 3671.40]  Hebrew.
[3671.94 --> 3672.42]  I worship
[3672.42 --> 3672.96]  the Lord,
[3673.08 --> 3673.62]  the God
[3673.62 --> 3674.14]  of heaven,
[3674.14 --> 3674.84]  who made
[3674.84 --> 3675.62]  the seas
[3675.62 --> 3676.32]  and the
[3676.32 --> 3676.92]  dry land.
[3677.84 --> 3678.08]  Like,
[3678.14 --> 3678.44]  in his
[3678.44 --> 3679.12]  heart of
[3679.12 --> 3679.48]  hearts,
[3679.54 --> 3680.14]  he knows
[3680.14 --> 3680.78]  there's no
[3680.78 --> 3681.64]  escaping the
[3681.64 --> 3682.02]  God of
[3682.02 --> 3682.20]  heaven.
[3682.30 --> 3682.68]  There's no
[3682.68 --> 3683.28]  running from
[3683.28 --> 3684.04]  him because
[3684.04 --> 3685.14]  he created
[3685.14 --> 3685.82]  the sea
[3685.82 --> 3686.24]  and the
[3686.24 --> 3686.86]  dry land.
[3687.22 --> 3687.62]  And so,
[3687.74 --> 3688.20]  there should
[3688.20 --> 3689.00]  only be
[3689.00 --> 3689.62]  submitting.
[3691.60 --> 3692.32]  But while
[3692.32 --> 3692.72]  on this
[3692.72 --> 3693.00]  boat,
[3693.12 --> 3693.46]  a great
[3693.46 --> 3694.38]  storm comes
[3694.38 --> 3695.10]  up and
[3695.10 --> 3695.68]  the sailors
[3695.68 --> 3696.78]  are terrified.
[3697.06 --> 3697.60]  They're afraid
[3697.60 --> 3698.12]  they're about
[3698.12 --> 3698.70]  to die.
[3698.70 --> 3699.42]  The boat
[3699.42 --> 3699.98]  is rocking
[3699.98 --> 3700.74]  around and
[3700.74 --> 3701.24]  things are
[3701.24 --> 3701.94]  falling off
[3701.94 --> 3702.40]  and people
[3702.40 --> 3702.98]  are crying
[3702.98 --> 3703.34]  out.
[3704.30 --> 3704.82]  And Jonah,
[3705.12 --> 3705.70]  being woken
[3705.70 --> 3706.18]  up by the
[3706.18 --> 3706.54]  captain,
[3706.82 --> 3708.18]  realizes that
[3708.18 --> 3708.90]  because he
[3708.90 --> 3710.06]  ran from God,
[3710.18 --> 3711.34]  this storm has
[3711.34 --> 3712.42]  fallen on them.
[3712.72 --> 3713.08]  And so he
[3713.08 --> 3714.02]  tells the sailors,
[3714.58 --> 3715.16]  throw me
[3715.16 --> 3716.40]  overboard and
[3716.40 --> 3716.92]  you will be
[3716.92 --> 3717.24]  saved.
[3717.34 --> 3717.66]  In fact,
[3717.92 --> 3718.38]  specifically,
[3718.58 --> 3718.92]  he says,
[3719.08 --> 3720.10]  throw me into
[3720.10 --> 3721.82]  the sea and
[3721.82 --> 3722.44]  it will become
[3722.44 --> 3722.82]  calm.
[3722.82 --> 3724.54]  Now,
[3725.50 --> 3726.02]  interestingly,
[3726.34 --> 3727.20]  the word
[3727.20 --> 3728.76]  there was
[3728.76 --> 3729.44]  originally written
[3729.44 --> 3730.08]  in Hebrew.
[3730.58 --> 3731.44]  The word in
[3731.44 --> 3732.20]  Hebrew for
[3732.20 --> 3733.38]  sea is
[3733.38 --> 3734.04]  yam.
[3735.08 --> 3736.16]  Y-A-M
[3736.16 --> 3736.78]  for those of you
[3736.78 --> 3737.18]  who are writing
[3737.18 --> 3737.48]  it down.
[3738.10 --> 3739.60]  Yam is also
[3739.60 --> 3741.04]  the Ugaritic
[3741.04 --> 3742.36]  word for the
[3742.36 --> 3743.54]  Canaanite god
[3743.54 --> 3744.56]  of the sea
[3744.56 --> 3745.52]  called
[3745.52 --> 3746.52]  yam.
[3746.52 --> 3748.94]  And so
[3748.94 --> 3749.72]  some see
[3749.72 --> 3751.08]  this as
[3751.08 --> 3752.28]  Jonah offering
[3752.28 --> 3753.34]  himself as
[3753.34 --> 3754.08]  a sacrifice
[3754.08 --> 3755.44]  to yam,
[3755.64 --> 3756.30]  the god of
[3756.30 --> 3756.68]  the sea,
[3756.78 --> 3757.42]  in order to
[3757.42 --> 3758.40]  calm the sea.
[3760.46 --> 3760.98]  Right?
[3761.06 --> 3761.90]  And so he's
[3761.90 --> 3764.46]  trying to
[3764.46 --> 3765.00]  placate
[3765.00 --> 3766.44]  another god
[3766.44 --> 3767.12]  of a particular
[3767.12 --> 3768.88]  region in
[3768.88 --> 3769.38]  the midst of
[3769.38 --> 3769.58]  this.
[3769.84 --> 3770.28]  And what's
[3770.28 --> 3770.94]  fascinating,
[3771.56 --> 3771.74]  right,
[3771.82 --> 3772.16]  look at
[3772.16 --> 3773.08]  verse 13,
[3774.16 --> 3774.70]  instead,
[3775.02 --> 3775.66]  so Jonah says,
[3775.74 --> 3776.48]  offer me as a
[3776.48 --> 3777.20]  sacrifice to
[3777.20 --> 3778.06]  yam and
[3778.06 --> 3778.78]  these pagan
[3778.78 --> 3779.34]  sailors.
[3780.62 --> 3781.06]  Instead,
[3781.78 --> 3782.44]  the men did
[3782.44 --> 3783.16]  their best to
[3783.16 --> 3783.76]  row back to
[3783.76 --> 3784.06]  land.
[3784.92 --> 3785.40]  That word
[3785.40 --> 3786.06]  instead is
[3786.06 --> 3787.26]  fascinating because
[3787.26 --> 3787.86]  they probably
[3787.86 --> 3788.44]  would have seen
[3788.44 --> 3789.02]  the world through
[3789.02 --> 3789.70]  that same lens
[3789.70 --> 3790.28]  that Jonah would
[3790.28 --> 3790.36]  have.
[3790.38 --> 3790.76]  They probably
[3790.76 --> 3791.04]  would have
[3791.04 --> 3791.44]  believed that,
[3791.52 --> 3791.60]  yeah,
[3791.90 --> 3792.64]  yam is here
[3792.64 --> 3793.32]  in this ocean
[3793.32 --> 3793.94]  and if we
[3793.94 --> 3794.44]  placate him,
[3794.52 --> 3794.86]  this storm
[3794.86 --> 3795.32]  will stop.
[3795.62 --> 3796.36]  But instead,
[3797.50 --> 3798.04]  they do
[3798.04 --> 3798.76]  something different.
[3801.06 --> 3803.10]  Instead of
[3803.10 --> 3804.82]  sacrificing to
[3804.82 --> 3805.24]  yam,
[3805.24 --> 3807.14]  these sailors
[3807.14 --> 3808.04]  cry out
[3808.04 --> 3809.04]  to the Lord.
[3809.54 --> 3809.94]  And again,
[3810.08 --> 3810.94]  read that closely.
[3811.40 --> 3811.78]  And if you're
[3811.78 --> 3812.32]  looking at your
[3812.32 --> 3812.58]  word,
[3812.92 --> 3813.74]  at your Bibles,
[3813.94 --> 3814.38]  the word
[3814.38 --> 3815.50]  Lord there
[3815.50 --> 3816.24]  is probably
[3816.24 --> 3817.30]  in all caps,
[3817.54 --> 3817.72]  right,
[3817.82 --> 3818.60]  L-O-R-D,
[3818.74 --> 3819.46]  in all caps.
[3819.46 --> 3820.24]  That's because
[3820.24 --> 3821.14]  it's translating
[3821.14 --> 3822.10]  the Hebrew word
[3822.10 --> 3822.68]  Yahweh,
[3822.92 --> 3823.34]  which is the
[3823.34 --> 3824.36]  covenant name
[3824.36 --> 3824.92]  of God.
[3825.04 --> 3825.42]  It is the
[3825.42 --> 3826.28]  special name
[3826.28 --> 3827.36]  that God
[3827.36 --> 3828.52]  reveals himself
[3828.52 --> 3829.24]  to Moses
[3829.24 --> 3830.28]  through and
[3830.28 --> 3831.32]  for his
[3831.32 --> 3831.94]  people.
[3831.94 --> 3833.48]  and here
[3833.48 --> 3834.30]  it's on
[3834.30 --> 3834.94]  the lips
[3834.94 --> 3835.64]  of these
[3835.64 --> 3836.32]  supposedly
[3836.32 --> 3837.06]  pagan
[3837.06 --> 3838.24]  mariners.
[3839.34 --> 3839.66]  Do not
[3839.66 --> 3840.10]  hold us
[3840.10 --> 3840.58]  accountable
[3840.58 --> 3841.24]  for killing
[3841.24 --> 3841.68]  an innocent
[3841.68 --> 3842.02]  man,
[3842.12 --> 3842.56]  for you,
[3842.74 --> 3842.98]  Lord,
[3843.08 --> 3843.66]  have done
[3843.66 --> 3844.36]  as you
[3844.36 --> 3845.34]  pleased.
[3847.10 --> 3847.66]  You,
[3847.84 --> 3848.12]  Lord,
[3848.24 --> 3848.80]  have done
[3848.80 --> 3849.52]  as you
[3849.52 --> 3850.40]  pleased.
[3850.84 --> 3851.64]  This is the
[3851.64 --> 3852.08]  confession
[3852.08 --> 3853.10]  that should
[3853.10 --> 3853.66]  be on the
[3853.66 --> 3854.08]  lips of
[3854.08 --> 3854.40]  Jonah.
[3854.40 --> 3854.48]  Jonah.
[3856.76 --> 3857.36]  But here
[3857.36 --> 3857.62]  it is
[3857.62 --> 3858.08]  coming from
[3858.08 --> 3858.38]  these
[3858.38 --> 3859.68]  sailors.
[3861.56 --> 3862.74]  Who knows
[3862.74 --> 3863.50]  this covenant
[3863.50 --> 3864.18]  God who
[3864.18 --> 3864.90]  is sovereign,
[3865.28 --> 3865.90]  who rules,
[3866.20 --> 3866.76]  who knows
[3866.76 --> 3867.10]  that he
[3867.10 --> 3868.10]  cannot escape
[3868.10 --> 3868.40]  no matter
[3868.40 --> 3868.90]  how far
[3868.90 --> 3869.56]  he runs,
[3870.10 --> 3870.62]  but he
[3870.62 --> 3871.00]  doesn't make
[3871.00 --> 3871.60]  that confession.
[3872.98 --> 3873.64]  It comes
[3873.64 --> 3873.96]  from the
[3873.96 --> 3874.46]  outsiders.
[3875.50 --> 3875.88]  It comes
[3875.88 --> 3876.18]  from the
[3876.18 --> 3876.72]  unexpected
[3876.72 --> 3877.86]  ones.
[3878.72 --> 3878.92]  Now,
[3879.50 --> 3880.82]  don't hear
[3880.82 --> 3881.12]  what I'm
[3881.12 --> 3881.68]  not saying
[3881.68 --> 3883.00]  because it
[3883.00 --> 3883.18]  would be
[3883.18 --> 3883.90]  really easy
[3883.90 --> 3884.38]  for you
[3884.38 --> 3884.92]  to stop
[3884.92 --> 3885.34]  listening
[3885.34 --> 3885.80]  at this
[3885.80 --> 3886.16]  point
[3886.16 --> 3887.00]  and think
[3887.00 --> 3887.44]  that I'm
[3887.44 --> 3887.78]  talking
[3887.78 --> 3888.06]  about
[3888.06 --> 3888.32]  some
[3888.32 --> 3888.64]  sort
[3888.64 --> 3889.02]  of
[3889.02 --> 3890.02]  universalism,
[3891.40 --> 3891.56]  right?
[3891.66 --> 3892.10]  That I'm
[3892.10 --> 3892.68]  talking about
[3892.68 --> 3893.40]  some sort
[3893.40 --> 3894.78]  of idea
[3894.78 --> 3895.18]  that these
[3895.18 --> 3895.88]  people didn't
[3895.88 --> 3896.52]  know what
[3896.52 --> 3896.84]  they were
[3896.84 --> 3897.22]  believing
[3897.22 --> 3898.04]  or what
[3898.04 --> 3898.34]  they were
[3898.34 --> 3898.64]  saying,
[3898.72 --> 3898.92]  but they
[3898.92 --> 3899.34]  just happened
[3899.34 --> 3899.66]  to say
[3899.66 --> 3899.86]  it.
[3900.74 --> 3901.08]  But I
[3901.08 --> 3901.42]  don't think
[3901.42 --> 3901.80]  that's the
[3901.80 --> 3902.08]  case,
[3902.16 --> 3902.40]  and I
[3902.40 --> 3902.80]  think that's
[3902.80 --> 3903.44]  actually made
[3903.44 --> 3903.90]  abundantly
[3903.90 --> 3904.44]  clear from
[3904.44 --> 3904.86]  the text
[3904.86 --> 3905.30]  itself.
[3905.74 --> 3906.22]  In verse
[3906.22 --> 3906.78]  16,
[3907.02 --> 3907.50]  we read,
[3908.10 --> 3908.64]  at this,
[3908.80 --> 3909.22]  the men
[3909.22 --> 3910.26]  greatly feared
[3910.26 --> 3910.76]  the Lord,
[3910.88 --> 3911.16]  again,
[3911.32 --> 3912.00]  covenant name,
[3912.28 --> 3912.56]  and they
[3912.56 --> 3913.06]  offered a
[3913.06 --> 3913.84]  sacrifice to
[3913.84 --> 3914.32]  the Lord
[3914.32 --> 3914.94]  and made
[3914.94 --> 3915.84]  vows to
[3915.84 --> 3916.06]  him.
[3917.64 --> 3917.98]  Now, you
[3917.98 --> 3918.40]  might hear
[3918.40 --> 3918.96]  that and
[3918.96 --> 3919.20]  think,
[3919.28 --> 3919.46]  well, they
[3919.46 --> 3919.94]  fear the
[3919.94 --> 3920.22]  Lord,
[3920.32 --> 3920.96]  they're afraid
[3920.96 --> 3921.54]  because they're
[3921.54 --> 3922.04]  afraid of
[3922.04 --> 3922.52]  the storm.
[3923.52 --> 3924.26]  But we
[3924.26 --> 3925.06]  also know
[3925.06 --> 3926.06]  regularly in
[3926.06 --> 3926.76]  the Old Testament
[3926.76 --> 3927.32]  scriptures,
[3927.58 --> 3928.18]  right, that
[3928.18 --> 3929.48]  to fear the
[3929.48 --> 3930.16]  Lord means
[3930.16 --> 3931.00]  something more,
[3931.38 --> 3931.56]  right?
[3931.60 --> 3932.46]  In Proverbs,
[3932.58 --> 3933.30]  the fear of
[3933.30 --> 3933.94]  the Lord is
[3933.94 --> 3934.44]  the beginning
[3934.44 --> 3935.40]  of wisdom.
[3936.12 --> 3936.78]  And in that
[3936.78 --> 3937.26]  sense,
[3937.52 --> 3938.72]  fear means
[3938.72 --> 3939.38]  awe,
[3939.52 --> 3939.98]  it means
[3939.98 --> 3940.74]  worship,
[3941.36 --> 3941.50]  right?
[3941.50 --> 3941.88]  It's a
[3941.88 --> 3942.76]  right understanding
[3942.76 --> 3943.20]  of the
[3943.20 --> 3944.06]  relationship to
[3944.06 --> 3944.48]  Yahweh,
[3944.58 --> 3944.94]  who's the
[3944.94 --> 3945.78]  God of
[3945.78 --> 3946.28]  heaven and
[3946.28 --> 3946.82]  the creator
[3946.82 --> 3947.30]  of the
[3947.30 --> 3948.10]  land and
[3948.10 --> 3948.44]  of the
[3948.44 --> 3948.74]  sea.
[3949.24 --> 3949.64]  And because
[3949.64 --> 3950.80]  these sailors
[3950.80 --> 3951.72]  feared the
[3951.72 --> 3952.10]  Lord,
[3952.48 --> 3953.00]  what did they
[3953.00 --> 3953.54]  do next?
[3954.34 --> 3954.62]  Well, they
[3954.62 --> 3955.06]  worshipped,
[3955.12 --> 3955.40]  they made
[3955.40 --> 3956.16]  sacrifice to
[3956.16 --> 3956.26]  him,
[3956.32 --> 3956.66]  they offered
[3956.66 --> 3957.22]  vows to
[3957.22 --> 3957.46]  him.
[3958.02 --> 3958.50]  And so I
[3958.50 --> 3958.86]  think that
[3958.86 --> 3959.16]  the word
[3959.16 --> 3959.96]  fear in
[3959.96 --> 3960.56]  this text
[3960.56 --> 3961.34]  is used
[3961.34 --> 3961.92]  very
[3961.92 --> 3962.56]  intentionally
[3962.56 --> 3963.94]  to show
[3963.94 --> 3965.16]  that it's
[3965.16 --> 3966.00]  the second
[3966.00 --> 3966.56]  sense,
[3966.62 --> 3966.98]  it's the
[3966.98 --> 3967.62]  worshipful
[3967.62 --> 3967.94]  sense,
[3967.94 --> 3968.28]  that these
[3968.28 --> 3968.70]  pagan
[3968.70 --> 3969.20]  sailors
[3969.20 --> 3970.14]  worshipped
[3970.14 --> 3970.64]  the Lord,
[3970.98 --> 3971.74]  they feared
[3971.74 --> 3972.64]  him more
[3972.64 --> 3973.72]  greatly and
[3973.72 --> 3974.78]  more appropriately
[3974.78 --> 3975.72]  than Jonah
[3975.72 --> 3976.68]  ever did.
[3979.98 --> 3980.76]  And so now
[3980.76 --> 3981.34]  think back to
[3981.34 --> 3981.74]  the purpose
[3981.74 --> 3982.34]  of this book.
[3983.20 --> 3983.80]  As the
[3983.80 --> 3984.32]  people of
[3984.32 --> 3984.60]  Judah,
[3984.84 --> 3985.22]  especially
[3985.22 --> 3986.02]  after the
[3986.02 --> 3986.56]  exile to
[3986.56 --> 3987.52]  the Babylonians,
[3987.96 --> 3988.52]  as they
[3988.52 --> 3989.18]  hear this
[3989.18 --> 3989.44]  story,
[3989.52 --> 3989.82]  as they
[3989.82 --> 3990.44]  read this
[3990.44 --> 3990.90]  story,
[3991.28 --> 3992.12]  their minds
[3992.12 --> 3992.66]  begin to
[3992.66 --> 3993.24]  turn on
[3993.24 --> 3994.04]  that fact,
[3994.68 --> 3995.50]  and they
[3995.50 --> 3995.82]  begin to
[3995.82 --> 3996.38]  ask themselves,
[3996.50 --> 3996.80]  so what
[3996.80 --> 3997.08]  does it
[3997.08 --> 3997.72]  really mean?
[3997.94 --> 3998.40]  To be
[3998.40 --> 3998.94]  chosen by
[3998.94 --> 3999.26]  God.
[4001.48 --> 4002.20]  They begin
[4002.20 --> 4002.60]  to wonder,
[4002.78 --> 4003.98]  can we
[4003.98 --> 4004.86]  rest on
[4004.86 --> 4005.72]  the laurels
[4005.72 --> 4006.32]  of having
[4006.32 --> 4007.30]  Moses or
[4007.30 --> 4007.76]  having the
[4007.76 --> 4008.06]  law?
[4009.18 --> 4009.88]  Or to
[4009.88 --> 4010.28]  put it in
[4010.28 --> 4010.64]  today's
[4010.64 --> 4011.08]  context,
[4011.20 --> 4011.46]  what does
[4011.46 --> 4011.78]  it really
[4011.78 --> 4012.82]  mean to
[4012.82 --> 4013.38]  be Christian?
[4014.60 --> 4015.08]  Can we
[4015.08 --> 4015.98]  rest on
[4015.98 --> 4017.16]  a 1700
[4017.16 --> 4018.28]  year history
[4018.28 --> 4019.04]  of relative
[4019.04 --> 4019.54]  Christian
[4019.54 --> 4020.08]  priority,
[4020.22 --> 4020.50]  at least
[4020.50 --> 4020.96]  here in
[4020.96 --> 4021.40]  the West,
[4021.50 --> 4021.82]  and so
[4021.82 --> 4022.60]  the social
[4022.60 --> 4023.06]  structures
[4023.06 --> 4023.82]  and the
[4023.82 --> 4024.32]  laws of
[4024.32 --> 4024.72]  the land
[4024.72 --> 4024.98]  should
[4024.98 --> 4025.42]  reflect
[4025.42 --> 4025.78]  that?
[4026.00 --> 4026.28]  Can we
[4026.28 --> 4026.68]  rest on
[4026.68 --> 4026.90]  those
[4026.90 --> 4027.34]  laurels?
[4027.94 --> 4028.36]  What does
[4028.36 --> 4028.72]  it mean
[4028.72 --> 4029.08]  to be
[4029.08 --> 4029.50]  Christian
[4029.50 --> 4030.06]  and to
[4030.06 --> 4030.28]  go to
[4030.28 --> 4030.58]  church
[4030.58 --> 4031.06]  every week?
[4031.10 --> 4031.32]  Is that
[4031.32 --> 4031.70]  enough?
[4032.06 --> 4032.36]  Am I
[4032.36 --> 4032.80]  checking the
[4032.80 --> 4033.32]  right boxes?
[4033.48 --> 4033.66]  Am I
[4033.66 --> 4034.02]  doing the
[4034.02 --> 4034.46]  right things?
[4034.54 --> 4034.76]  Am I
[4034.76 --> 4035.44]  presuming too
[4035.44 --> 4035.88]  much about
[4035.88 --> 4036.92]  myself or
[4036.92 --> 4037.66]  about what
[4037.66 --> 4038.62]  I believe
[4038.62 --> 4039.22]  God should
[4039.22 --> 4039.74]  be doing
[4039.74 --> 4040.90]  and not
[4040.90 --> 4041.46]  actually having
[4041.46 --> 4041.84]  my eyes
[4041.84 --> 4042.28]  open to
[4042.28 --> 4042.70]  what God
[4042.70 --> 4044.20]  is doing
[4044.20 --> 4045.08]  and where
[4045.08 --> 4045.84]  God is
[4045.84 --> 4046.94]  working?
[4046.94 --> 4047.56]  God
[4047.56 --> 4049.56]  is there
[4049.56 --> 4050.58]  something deeper
[4050.58 --> 4051.92]  something more
[4051.92 --> 4052.32]  that should
[4052.32 --> 4052.86]  be happening
[4052.86 --> 4053.32]  in our
[4053.32 --> 4053.88]  hearts
[4053.88 --> 4054.98]  and among
[4054.98 --> 4055.50]  us
[4055.50 --> 4056.32]  as we
[4056.32 --> 4056.64]  gather?
[4059.40 --> 4060.08]  Genuine
[4060.08 --> 4060.74]  belief
[4060.74 --> 4062.30]  requires
[4062.30 --> 4063.54]  conversion
[4063.54 --> 4064.78]  conversion
[4064.78 --> 4065.80]  requires a
[4065.80 --> 4067.00]  new heart
[4067.00 --> 4067.54]  in the
[4067.54 --> 4068.06]  language of
[4068.06 --> 4068.30]  the New
[4068.30 --> 4068.70]  Testament
[4068.70 --> 4070.06]  it requires
[4070.06 --> 4070.42]  that you
[4070.42 --> 4071.10]  be born
[4071.10 --> 4071.62]  again
[4071.62 --> 4073.80]  these men
[4073.80 --> 4075.48]  these sailors
[4075.48 --> 4076.24]  are an
[4076.24 --> 4077.18]  example of
[4077.18 --> 4077.70]  what that
[4077.70 --> 4078.30]  might look
[4078.30 --> 4078.66]  like
[4078.66 --> 4079.36]  and it
[4079.36 --> 4080.00]  ought to
[4080.00 --> 4080.82]  be surprising
[4080.82 --> 4081.44]  to you
[4081.44 --> 4084.44]  now Jonah
[4084.44 --> 4085.08]  does end up
[4085.08 --> 4085.52]  overboard
[4085.52 --> 4087.08]  right he
[4087.08 --> 4087.64]  does end up
[4087.64 --> 4087.90]  in the
[4087.90 --> 4088.56]  raging sea
[4088.56 --> 4088.96]  and it
[4088.96 --> 4089.58]  does calm
[4089.58 --> 4089.98]  down
[4089.98 --> 4090.54]  because he
[4090.54 --> 4091.30]  is given
[4091.30 --> 4091.66]  over
[4091.66 --> 4092.10]  and as
[4092.10 --> 4092.72]  we read
[4092.72 --> 4093.20]  in verse
[4093.20 --> 4093.80]  17
[4093.80 --> 4094.66]  the Lord
[4094.66 --> 4095.44]  does provide
[4095.44 --> 4095.90]  a huge
[4095.90 --> 4096.50]  fish to
[4096.50 --> 4096.86]  swallow
[4096.86 --> 4097.28]  Jonah
[4097.28 --> 4097.84]  and Jonah
[4097.84 --> 4098.48]  is in
[4098.48 --> 4099.22]  the belly
[4099.22 --> 4099.66]  of that
[4099.66 --> 4099.96]  fish
[4099.96 --> 4100.64]  three days
[4100.64 --> 4101.46]  and three
[4101.46 --> 4101.84]  nights
[4101.84 --> 4104.36]  and that's
[4104.36 --> 4104.82]  kind of the
[4104.82 --> 4105.22]  part of the
[4105.22 --> 4105.68]  children's
[4105.68 --> 4106.12]  story that
[4106.12 --> 4106.42]  we get
[4106.42 --> 4106.68]  right
[4106.68 --> 4107.92]  and maybe
[4107.92 --> 4108.18]  that's
[4108.18 --> 4108.46]  it
[4108.46 --> 4112.74]  now
[4112.74 --> 4115.74]  as we
[4115.74 --> 4116.18]  ask
[4116.18 --> 4116.86]  ourselves
[4116.86 --> 4117.70]  this
[4117.70 --> 4118.56]  question
[4118.56 --> 4120.10]  of how
[4120.10 --> 4121.44]  is God's
[4121.44 --> 4122.20]  election
[4122.20 --> 4123.32]  bigger
[4123.32 --> 4124.40]  than what I
[4124.40 --> 4124.84]  think he
[4124.84 --> 4125.34]  should rightly
[4125.34 --> 4126.18]  do I
[4126.18 --> 4126.54]  also want
[4126.54 --> 4126.82]  to draw
[4126.82 --> 4127.18]  another
[4127.18 --> 4127.98]  example
[4127.98 --> 4128.74]  and parallel
[4128.74 --> 4130.18]  because you
[4130.18 --> 4130.46]  see
[4130.46 --> 4133.10]  centuries
[4133.10 --> 4134.22]  after
[4134.22 --> 4134.84]  this
[4134.84 --> 4135.68]  story
[4135.68 --> 4137.54]  you have
[4137.54 --> 4137.80]  a new
[4137.80 --> 4138.28]  man who
[4138.28 --> 4138.74]  shows up
[4138.74 --> 4139.10]  on the
[4139.10 --> 4139.38]  scene
[4139.38 --> 4139.80]  a man
[4139.80 --> 4140.20]  named
[4140.20 --> 4140.94]  Jesus
[4140.94 --> 4141.96]  and he
[4141.96 --> 4142.36]  does
[4142.36 --> 4143.16]  the exact
[4143.16 --> 4143.90]  same
[4143.90 --> 4144.56]  thing
[4144.56 --> 4145.90]  he subverts
[4145.90 --> 4146.66]  expectations
[4146.66 --> 4147.60]  of who
[4147.60 --> 4148.28]  God is
[4148.28 --> 4148.68]  rightly
[4148.68 --> 4149.44]  choosing
[4149.44 --> 4149.78]  Jesus
[4149.78 --> 4150.40]  meets
[4150.40 --> 4150.96]  with a
[4150.96 --> 4151.58]  Samaritan
[4151.58 --> 4152.02]  woman
[4152.02 --> 4152.70]  at a
[4152.70 --> 4152.98]  well
[4152.98 --> 4153.42]  first of
[4153.42 --> 4153.54]  all
[4153.54 --> 4153.98]  she is
[4153.98 --> 4154.56]  a woman
[4154.56 --> 4154.94]  he should
[4154.94 --> 4155.22]  not be
[4155.22 --> 4155.60]  talking to
[4155.60 --> 4155.74]  her
[4155.74 --> 4156.02]  second
[4156.02 --> 4156.38]  of all
[4156.38 --> 4157.06]  she has
[4157.06 --> 4157.82]  led
[4157.82 --> 4158.50]  a very
[4158.50 --> 4160.50]  confused
[4160.50 --> 4161.20]  and broken
[4161.20 --> 4161.98]  and immoral
[4161.98 --> 4162.80]  life
[4162.80 --> 4164.56]  and he
[4164.56 --> 4164.96]  welcomes
[4164.96 --> 4165.34]  her
[4165.34 --> 4166.22]  and he
[4166.22 --> 4166.50]  loves
[4166.50 --> 4166.84]  her
[4166.84 --> 4167.24]  and he
[4167.24 --> 4167.84]  includes
[4167.84 --> 4168.30]  her
[4168.30 --> 4169.06]  in the
[4169.06 --> 4169.38]  kingdom
[4169.38 --> 4171.42]  Jesus
[4171.42 --> 4172.12]  does this
[4172.12 --> 4172.64]  you can read
[4172.64 --> 4172.98]  it in the
[4172.98 --> 4173.56]  gospel stories
[4173.56 --> 4174.38]  he goes
[4174.38 --> 4174.94]  out into
[4174.94 --> 4175.52]  the region
[4175.52 --> 4175.88]  called
[4175.88 --> 4176.36]  the
[4176.36 --> 4178.68]  decapolis
[4178.68 --> 4179.10]  sorry
[4179.10 --> 4179.90]  the decapolis
[4179.90 --> 4180.72]  which is the
[4180.72 --> 4181.10]  region of
[4181.10 --> 4181.72]  ten cities
[4181.72 --> 4182.06]  these are
[4182.06 --> 4182.44]  ten
[4182.44 --> 4183.52]  gentile
[4183.52 --> 4183.88]  that is
[4183.88 --> 4184.72]  non-believing
[4184.72 --> 4185.12]  pagan
[4185.12 --> 4185.58]  cities
[4185.58 --> 4186.28]  outside
[4186.28 --> 4187.28]  of the
[4187.28 --> 4188.50]  area
[4188.50 --> 4189.10]  of
[4189.10 --> 4190.02]  Israel
[4190.02 --> 4190.48]  there
[4190.48 --> 4191.56]  and he
[4191.56 --> 4191.88]  goes
[4191.88 --> 4192.22]  and he
[4192.22 --> 4192.56]  preaches
[4192.56 --> 4193.00]  to these
[4193.00 --> 4193.50]  gentile
[4193.50 --> 4193.96]  nations
[4193.96 --> 4194.44]  and every
[4194.44 --> 4194.74]  time
[4194.74 --> 4194.92]  his
[4194.92 --> 4195.28]  disciples
[4195.28 --> 4195.58]  are like
[4195.58 --> 4195.92]  why do
[4195.92 --> 4196.20]  you go
[4196.20 --> 4196.50]  there
[4196.50 --> 4197.24]  they're
[4197.24 --> 4197.48]  not
[4197.48 --> 4197.76]  of
[4197.76 --> 4198.26]  us
[4198.26 --> 4199.38]  and
[4199.38 --> 4199.56]  Jesus
[4199.56 --> 4199.78]  says
[4199.78 --> 4199.98]  I'm
[4199.98 --> 4200.24]  going
[4200.24 --> 4200.66]  there
[4200.66 --> 4201.38]  because
[4201.38 --> 4201.60]  my

[4286.98 --> 4288.26]  reflection
[4288.26 --> 4290.72]  part
[4290.72 --> 4291.08]  of where
[4291.08 --> 4291.44]  all this
[4291.44 --> 4291.74]  comes
[4291.74 --> 4292.30]  together
[4292.30 --> 4293.58]  part
[4293.58 --> 4293.90]  of the
[4293.90 --> 4294.24]  story
[4294.24 --> 4294.44]  of
[4294.44 --> 4294.74]  Jonah
[4294.74 --> 4295.08]  that
[4295.08 --> 4295.54]  we
[4295.54 --> 4295.72]  are
[4295.72 --> 4296.68]  focusing
[4296.68 --> 4296.90]  on
[4296.90 --> 4297.08]  here
[4297.08 --> 4297.38]  in this
[4297.38 --> 4297.84]  question
[4297.84 --> 4298.88]  leaves
[4298.88 --> 4299.30]  us
[4299.30 --> 4299.72]  with
[4299.72 --> 4299.98]  the
[4299.98 --> 4300.64]  disturbing
[4300.64 --> 4301.62]  possibility
[4301.62 --> 4303.42]  that having
[4303.42 --> 4303.98]  pledged
[4303.98 --> 4304.66]  our lives
[4304.66 --> 4305.28]  to God
[4305.28 --> 4306.88]  we could
[4306.88 --> 4307.46]  spend
[4307.46 --> 4308.40]  as much
[4308.40 --> 4309.18]  of that
[4309.18 --> 4309.80]  life
[4309.80 --> 4310.86]  avoiding
[4310.86 --> 4311.80]  the
[4311.80 --> 4312.16]  God
[4312.16 --> 4312.50]  that we
[4312.50 --> 4312.92]  set out
[4312.92 --> 4313.40]  to serve
[4313.40 --> 4315.64]  having
[4315.64 --> 4316.16]  pledged
[4316.16 --> 4316.62]  our lives
[4316.62 --> 4317.04]  to God
[4317.04 --> 4317.48]  calling
[4317.48 --> 4318.06]  ourselves
[4318.06 --> 4318.88]  Christians
[4318.88 --> 4319.38]  calling
[4319.38 --> 4319.70]  him
[4319.70 --> 4320.14]  his
[4320.14 --> 4320.56]  followers
[4320.56 --> 4321.48]  we might
[4321.48 --> 4322.02]  be fleeing
[4322.02 --> 4322.46]  to our
[4322.46 --> 4322.70]  own
[4322.70 --> 4323.16]  Tarshish
[4323.16 --> 4323.46]  because
[4323.46 --> 4323.94]  we don't
[4323.94 --> 4324.28]  like
[4324.28 --> 4324.74]  what
[4324.74 --> 4325.14]  God
[4325.14 --> 4325.88]  is
[4325.88 --> 4326.22]  doing
[4326.22 --> 4329.30]  open
[4329.30 --> 4329.64]  your
[4329.64 --> 4330.28]  eyes
[4330.28 --> 4331.30]  and

[4331.98 --> 4332.52]  the
