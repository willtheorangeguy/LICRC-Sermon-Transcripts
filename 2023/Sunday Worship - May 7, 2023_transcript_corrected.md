[0.00 → 2.10] One, two, three!
[30.00 → 33.00] I am the king of excuses.
[33.90 → 37.40] I've got one for every selfish thing I do.
[38.90 → 42.40] What's going on inside of me?
[43.20 → 46.40] I despise my own behaviour.
[47.40 → 51.40] This only serves to confirm my suspicions
[52.24 → 55.44] that I'm still a man in need of a saviour.
[55.44 → 61.14] I want to be in the light as you are in the light.
[61.44 → 64.74] I want to shine like the stars in the heavens.
[66.14 → 70.30] Oh, Lord, be my light and be my salvation.
[70.94 → 73.60] Because all I want is to be in the light.
[75.04 → 78.10] All I want is to be in the light.
[79.38 → 83.64] The disease of self runs through my blood.
[83.64 → 87.34] It's a cancer fatal to my soul.
[88.94 → 93.04] Every attempt on my feet I pass fail
[93.04 → 96.10] to bring this sadness under control.
[96.98 → 101.44] Ooh, tell me what's going on inside of me.
[102.30 → 105.14] I despise my own behaviour.
[105.14 → 110.64] This only serves to confirm my suspicions
[110.64 → 114.04] that I'm still a man in need of a saviour.
[114.04 → 115.04] Oh, yeah.
[115.94 → 120.04] I want to be in the light as you are in the light.
[120.04 → 124.04] I want to shine like the stars in the heavens.
[125.04 → 129.04] Oh, Lord, be my light and be my salvation.
[129.04 → 132.64] Cause all I want is to be in the light.
[132.74 → 133.24] Yeah.
[134.34 → 137.14] All I want is to be in the light.
[137.24 → 137.60] Yeah.
[138.44 → 138.94] Ooh.
[138.94 → 139.64] Ooh.
[139.64 → 149.44] See?
[152.84 → 153.28] Ooh.
[153.28 → 159.06] Honesty becomes me
[159.06 → 161.08] There's nothing left to lose
[161.08 → 163.62] Our secrets that did wrong me
[163.62 → 165.66] In your presence I defuse
[165.66 → 167.94] But there's no position
[167.94 → 170.04] There's reaching out no more
[170.04 → 172.82] The thing that wants to cover me
[172.82 → 174.42] Has been sent to the sun
[174.42 → 176.64] Has been sent to the sun
[176.64 → 180.82] Tell me what you're going on inside of me
[180.82 → 184.92] I defy my own behaviour
[184.92 → 188.50] This song I search to remember
[188.50 → 190.68] My suspicions
[190.68 → 193.88] That I'm still in need of a senior
[193.88 → 197.62] I want to be in the light
[197.62 → 199.60] As you are in the light
[199.60 → 203.24] I want to shine like the stars in the heavens
[203.24 → 206.62] Oh, I'll be my light
[206.62 → 208.78] And I'll be my salvation
[208.78 → 212.06] Cause all I want is to be in the light
[212.06 → 216.84] All I want is to be in the light
[216.84 → 220.02] I want to be in the light
[220.02 → 222.32] As you are in the light
[222.32 → 225.68] I want to shine like the stars in the heavens
[225.68 → 229.38] Oh, Lord, be my light
[229.38 → 231.50] And be my salvation
[231.50 → 234.78] Cause all I want is to be in the light
[234.78 → 235.62] All I want
[235.62 → 239.28] All I want is to be in the light
[239.28 → 241.28] All I want, all I want
[241.28 → 243.88] All I want is to be
[243.88 → 247.42] In the light
[247.42 → 275.16] What is that?
[275.16 → 305.14] I don't want you to be.
[305.16 → 335.14] God's not dead.
[335.16 → 365.14] I don't want you to be.
[365.14 → 368.46] A revolution somehow.
[370.26 → 374.38] Now I'm lost in your freedom.
[374.38 → 381.38] I don't want you to be.
[381.38 → 383.70] I don't want you to be.
[383.70 → 385.42] God's not dead.
[385.48 → 387.04] He's surely alive.
[387.12 → 389.40] He's living on the inside.
[389.58 → 391.10] I'm going like a lion.
[391.44 → 392.84] God's not dead.
[393.02 → 393.70] He's surely alive.
[394.50 → 396.74] He's living on the inside.
[396.94 → 398.46] I'm going like a lion.
[398.70 → 402.70] I'm going like a lion.
[402.70 → 404.02] I'm going like a lion.
[406.02 → 412.84] Let hope rise and make the darkness hide.
[413.70 → 416.04] My faith is dead.
[416.14 → 420.02] I need a resurrection somehow.
[420.02 → 426.02] I know I'm lost in your freedom.
[426.02 → 427.80] I'm going like a lion.
[427.80 → 429.02] I'm going like a lion.
[429.02 → 434.04] And this world I'll overcome.
[435.08 → 436.98] God's not dead.
[437.10 → 438.72] He's surely alive.
[438.82 → 441.12] He's living on the inside.
[441.26 → 442.74] I'm going like a lion.
[443.10 → 444.54] God's not dead.
[444.70 → 445.98] He's surely alive.
[445.98 → 450.20] He's living on the inside, roaring like a lion
[450.20 → 455.98] He's roaring, he's roaring, he's roaring like a lion
[455.98 → 460.16] He's roaring, he's roaring
[460.16 → 466.70] Let heaven roar and fire fall
[466.70 → 473.72] Come shake the ground with the sound of revival
[473.72 → 477.48] Let heaven roar
[477.48 → 482.00] Good morning.
[484.72 → 486.68] All right, I'll wait for the people in the back. It's all right.
[488.16 → 491.90] Ooh, that was fast. Good morning.
[493.18 → 495.36] Welcome to worship.
[495.60 → 498.10] It's our hope and prayer today that in our gathering,
[498.48 → 500.16] not only do you get to hang out with each other,
[500.16 → 503.28] not only do we get to sing some amazing songs together,
[503.28 → 506.74] but that here you will be met by Jesus.
[508.06 → 511.80] That's our longing, that we meet Jesus together in our worship.
[512.46 → 514.58] If you're visiting with us, my name is Chris.
[514.76 → 516.04] I'm one of the pastors here.
[516.34 → 518.06] It's my privilege, along with a few others,
[518.18 → 522.22] to lead in our shared worship together today.
[522.38 → 524.14] Before we begin, there are a couple announcements.
[524.34 → 526.66] I'm going to invite Josh to make his way to the front.
[526.66 → 534.34] As Josh is coming up, just a reminder that youth coffee is happening after service today.
[534.34 → 538.88] And so that's for grade eight through high school and the leaders.
[539.14 → 542.44] And you are going to the Porter's house for coffee.
[542.50 → 545.76] And I want to clarify, that's not Porter's coffee shop up the road.
[545.98 → 547.32] They're closed on Sunday.
[547.32 → 551.18] But to Tara's house, she's back there waving.
[551.46 → 552.88] And Kevin also knows where that is.
[552.94 → 555.84] So if you have questions about that, talk to either one of them,
[555.96 → 557.70] and they will get you situated.
[558.08 → 558.32] Josh.
[559.10 → 559.40] Hello.
[559.84 → 560.24] Awesome.
[561.12 → 561.30] Okay.
[561.44 → 565.20] So just a reminder, young adults, today we are going to Castle Fun Park.
[565.36 → 566.60] We're going to have some fun.
[567.02 → 567.20] Woo!
[568.14 → 572.12] We're leaving here at 630 if you want to carpool to there,
[572.12 → 574.04] because it's Wacom Road exit.
[574.04 → 576.18] So, yeah, that's it.
[578.30 → 579.24] Ladies and gentlemen.
[584.34 → 586.64] I believe that is it for Adolfsitz.
[586.72 → 591.86] So I'm going to invite you, as you are able, to stand as we come together in our worship.
[597.28 → 601.48] As I began, we come here to meet Jesus and to be met by him.
[601.48 → 605.52] And we mark God's presence among us with his greeting.
[605.74 → 608.28] And so I invite you to receive his greeting.
[609.72 → 616.94] Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son, and our Saviour,
[617.38 → 619.80] through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[620.96 → 621.26] Amen.
[622.20 → 626.42] I'm going to invite you, turn to those around you and welcome them into the presence of Jesus.
[626.42 → 630.48] You can do that with a handshake or a fist bump, or however is appropriate.
[634.76 → 638.58] Good morning.
[638.58 → 638.60] Good morning.
[638.60 → 661.56] Good morning.
[662.34 → 666.04] Our call to worship this morning comes from Psalm 147.
[666.04 → 670.28] People of God, let your eyes be opened by the Holy Spirit.
[670.82 → 671.82] See the work of God.
[672.20 → 673.42] Hear his word and believe.
[673.98 → 676.76] Sing holy, holy, holy with the host of heaven.
[677.22 → 677.94] Praise the Lord.
[678.56 → 680.68] For it is good to sing praises to our God.
[681.02 → 683.58] For it is pleasant and a song of praise is fitting.
[684.32 → 686.00] The Lord builds up Jerusalem.
[686.58 → 688.40] He gathers the outcasts of Israel.
[688.82 → 690.20] He heals the brokenhearted.
[690.66 → 692.00] He binds up their wounds.
[692.72 → 694.84] He determines the numbers of the stars.
[694.84 → 696.96] And he gives to all of them their names.
[697.56 → 699.70] Great is our Lord and abundant in power.
[700.36 → 702.22] His understanding is beyond measure.
[702.76 → 704.10] The Lord lifts the humble.
[704.58 → 706.16] He casts the wicked to the ground.
[706.44 → 708.96] For he is merciful, and he is a just God.
[709.38 → 710.22] Praise the Lord.
[710.22 → 724.90] To the gloom, Ah Sketch, I bogie.
[724.90 → 747.38] Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
[747.38 → 751.38] Holy, holy is He.
[751.38 → 766.38] Sing a new song to Him who sits on Heaven's mercy seat.
[766.38 → 775.38] Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
[775.38 → 780.38] Holy, holy is He.
[782.38 → 794.38] Sing a new song to Him who sits on Heaven's mercy seat.
[794.38 → 809.38] Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty who was and is and is to come.
[809.38 → 816.38] With all creation I sing praise to the King of kings.
[816.38 → 824.38] You are my everything and I will adore You.
[824.38 → 845.38] Golden rainbows of living colour.
[845.38 → 852.38] Flashes of lightning, rolls of thunder.
[852.38 → 866.38] Blessing and honour, strength and glory and power be to You the only wise King.
[866.38 → 881.38] Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty who was and is and is to come.
[881.38 → 888.38] With all creation I sing praise to the King of kings.
[888.38 → 896.38] You are my everything and I will adore You.
[896.38 → 911.38] Filled with wonder, awe-struck wonder, at the mention of Your name.
[911.38 → 926.38] Filled with wonder, awe-struck wonder, at the mention of Your name.
[926.38 → 939.38] Filled with wonder, awe-struck wonder, at the mention of Your name.
[939.38 → 951.38] Jesus, Your name is power, breath and living water, such a marvellous mystery.
[951.38 → 968.38] Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty who was and is and is to come.
[968.38 → 975.38] With all creation I sing praise to the King of kings.
[975.38 → 982.38] You are my everything and I will adore You.
[982.38 → 996.38] Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty who was and is and is and is to come.
[996.38 → 1015.38] W handed, awe-struck wonder, He would love you for a Tao special-
[1015.38 → 1018.86] literate, 1814 un Dortmund-
[1018.86 → 1019.86] Amen.
[1048.86 → 1049.86] Amen.
[1078.86 → 1080.86] Amen.
[1108.86 → 1116.20] I will sing of the goodness of God.
[1117.14 → 1120.20] I love your voice.
[1121.10 → 1128.50] You have led me through the fire in the darkest night.
[1129.06 → 1132.26] You are close like no other.
[1133.80 → 1135.94] I've known you as a father.
[1135.94 → 1140.26] I've known you as a friend.
[1140.80 → 1146.94] I have lived in the goodness of God.
[1149.32 → 1154.06] All my life you have been faithful.
[1156.64 → 1163.36] All my life you have been so, so good.
[1163.36 → 1176.58] With every breath that I am able, I will sing of the goodness of God.
[1176.58 → 1184.58] Your goodness is running after, it's running after me.
[1185.58 → 1191.74] Your goodness is running after, it's running after me.
[1191.74 → 1196.08] With my life laid down, I surrender now.
[1196.32 → 1198.48] I give you everything.
[1198.48 → 1205.48] Your goodness is running after, it's running after me.
[1205.48 → 1212.48] Your goodness is running after, it's running after me.
[1212.48 → 1219.48] Your goodness is running after, it's running after me.
[1219.48 → 1224.48] With my life laid down, I surrender now.
[1224.48 → 1231.48] Your goodness is running after, it's running after me.
[1231.48 → 1233.48] Your goodness is running after me.
[1233.48 → 1234.48] It's running after me.
[1234.48 → 1235.48] It's running after me.
[1235.48 → 1239.48] Your goodness is running after, it's running after me.
[1239.48 → 1241.48] Your goodness is running after, it's running after me.
[1241.48 → 1243.48] been faithful
[1243.48 → 1252.48] all my life you have been so, so good
[1252.48 → 1258.52] with every breath that I am able
[1258.52 → 1266.00] I will sing of the goodness of God
[1266.00 → 1275.44] I will sing of the goodness of God
[1275.44 → 1285.60] During preparation for planning for this service
[1285.60 → 1288.62] I sat with Jonah 3 and worked through the themes
[1288.62 → 1290.64] and ideas presented by the text
[1290.64 → 1294.16] The response by the king of Nineveh is profound
[1294.16 → 1296.64] one of belief leading to repentance
[1296.64 → 1298.32] Verse 6 says
[1298.32 → 1301.54] He rose from his throne and laid aside his robe
[1301.54 → 1303.80] covered himself with sackcloth
[1303.80 → 1305.38] and sat in ashes
[1305.38 → 1307.96] A king setting aside his authority
[1307.96 → 1309.40] recognizing his guilt
[1309.40 → 1310.78] calling out to God
[1310.78 → 1314.32] that God might relent and turn from his fierce anger
[1314.32 → 1317.48] As we heard from Josh last week
[1317.48 → 1320.96] we are men and women of contradiction
[1320.96 → 1324.30] Just as Jonah knew better
[1324.30 → 1325.44] he still sinned
[1325.44 → 1326.62] we still sin
[1326.62 → 1329.08] How often do we sin
[1329.08 → 1330.50] and don't recognize it
[1330.50 → 1331.64] or justify it
[1331.64 → 1333.80] and don't turn to God in repentance
[1333.80 → 1337.04] How often do we think we are too good
[1337.04 → 1339.40] to recognize our own sin and brokenness
[1339.40 → 1342.20] Do we hide behind false perfection
[1342.20 → 1345.82] or how often do we forget
[1345.82 → 1347.98] that salvation belongs to our God
[1347.98 → 1350.40] that God is gracious and compassionate
[1350.40 → 1353.92] How often do we think our sin is too ugly
[1353.92 → 1355.68] or too awful to be forgiven
[1355.68 → 1358.22] and fall into self-loathing
[1358.22 → 1360.16] The hymn
[1360.16 → 1362.30] Rebuke Me Not in Anger, Lord
[1362.30 → 1365.10] draws directly from Psalm 38
[1365.10 → 1367.34] which is a lament hymn
[1367.34 → 1368.66] that I imagine is not much
[1368.66 → 1371.06] unlike the cries of the king of Nineveh
[1371.06 → 1372.08] a pagan king
[1372.08 → 1373.80] crying out to the God
[1373.80 → 1375.28] we claim to believe in
[1375.28 → 1378.06] The version we are going to sing today
[1378.06 → 1379.82] has a new melody
[1379.82 → 1381.16] and brings in some language
[1381.16 → 1382.28] from Jonah 3
[1382.28 → 1383.96] Notice the words
[1383.96 → 1386.72] And let God's love cut your conscience
[1386.72 → 1388.74] and move your heart to repentance
[1388.74 → 1389.74] Rebuke Me Not in Anger, Lord
[1389.74 → 1393.74] Rebuke Me Not in Anger, Lord
[1393.74 → 1395.74] Rebuke Me Not in Anger, Lord
[1395.74 → 1408.74] Rebuke Me Not in Anger, Lord
[1408.74 → 1412.26] Rebuke Me Not in Anger, Lord
[1412.26 → 1416.74] Rebuke me not in anger, Lord
[1416.74 → 1417.74] Re World's Heroin that your
[1417.74 → 1418.74] Rebuke Me Not in Anger, Lord
[1418.74 → 1420.96] Rebuke Me Not in Anger, Lord
[1420.96 → 1423.88] your hero's wound and bring despair
[1423.88 → 1424.74] Rebuke Me Not in Anger, Lord
[1424.74 → 1425.74] посмотр in details
[1425.74 → 1427.76] my food of alcohol Bye Want Broadly
[1427.76 → 1428.80] Rival II, the God of God, Lord
[1428.80 → 1433.80] that is too much for me to bear
[1433.80 → 1436.74] singing Laurel, the God of all world
[1436.74 → 1438.74] friends that I dream worthy main
[1438.74 → 1442.42] Sinful folly brought me low,
[1442.42 → 1447.02] Bow down I groan in anguished grief,
[1447.26 → 1451.60] I have no strength for I am crushed,
[1451.86 → 1456.72] And spend my days with no relief.
[1458.78 → 1461.30] You know my size,
[1461.94 → 1465.88] And weakness my blinded eyes,
[1465.88 → 1470.24] O Lord, my throbbing heart,
[1470.90 → 1475.88] With nothing I cling to empty pride,
[1477.02 → 1479.18] My sinful ways,
[1479.90 → 1483.70] And idols I spend my days,
[1484.38 → 1488.08] In fear, wonder, and search,
[1488.88 → 1494.14] In longing for that which satisfies,
[1494.14 → 1499.32] It's you, Lord,
[1499.84 → 1504.82] My heart knows but does not understand,
[1507.00 → 1512.50] Lord, I tear my clothes and sit here
[1512.50 → 1518.20] In the ash of my sin.
[1521.42 → 1526.38] My pain is ever with me, Lord,
[1526.52 → 1530.84] For I have sinned against your laws,
[1531.04 → 1535.22] My foes are mighty, those who hate,
[1535.22 → 1540.40] Yet I am just as sinful God.
[1541.52 → 1544.78] You know my size,
[1545.00 → 1549.08] And weakness my blinded eyes,
[1549.08 → 1553.40] O Lord, my throbbing heart,
[1553.40 → 1559.08] With nothing I cling to empty pride,
[1559.08 → 1562.14] My sinful ways,
[1562.14 → 1566.60] And idols I spend my days,
[1566.60 → 1570.94] In fear, wonder, and search,
[1570.94 → 1576.82] In longing for that which satisfies,
[1576.82 → 1581.94] It's you, Lord,
[1581.94 → 1587.50] My heart knows but does not understand,
[1587.50 → 1595.02] Lord, I tear my clothes and sit here
[1595.02 → 1600.38] In the ash of my sin.
[1600.38 → 1608.94] Do not forsake me, O my Lord,
[1608.94 → 1613.58] Do not go far from me, my God,
[1613.70 → 1616.16] Come quickly now,
[1616.30 → 1618.46] Help me now, I pray,
[1618.84 → 1624.98] O Lord, my Saviour and my God.
[1624.98 → 1630.80] Lift your hearts and receive
[1630.80 → 1632.30] The sure promise of the gospel.
[1632.96 → 1634.62] The Lord is merciful and gracious,
[1635.34 → 1637.70] Slow to anger and great in mercy.
[1638.36 → 1640.08] God so loved the world that he gave
[1640.08 → 1641.26] His only-begotten Son,
[1641.70 → 1643.28] That whoever believes in him
[1643.28 → 1645.68] Should not perish but have everlasting life.
[1646.46 → 1648.10] To all who believe and repent,
[1648.10 → 1650.92] This promise is most surely given.
[1651.46 → 1652.46] In the name of the Father,
[1652.88 → 1654.34] The Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[1654.98 → 1658.74] In the name of the Father,
[1658.74 → 1661.70] The Creator of heaven and earth,
[1661.70 → 1664.44] I believe in Jesus Christ,
[1664.78 → 1666.60] The only Son of our world.
[1667.20 → 1669.46] He was received by the Holy Spirit,
[1669.82 → 1671.70] And born of the Virgin Mary.
[1672.40 → 1674.54] He suffered under Pontius Pilate,
[1675.00 → 1677.48] He was crucified, died, and buried.
[1678.22 → 1679.80] He descended to the hell,
[1680.32 → 1683.02] And on the very day he rose again from the dead.
[1683.02 → 1685.04] He ascended to heaven,
[1685.04 → 1687.94] And is seated at the right hand of God,
[1688.02 → 1689.08] The Father Almighty.
[1689.74 → 1691.88] And from there he will come to judge
[1691.88 → 1693.30] To the living and the dead.
[1694.04 → 1696.14] I believe in the Holy Spirit,
[1696.76 → 1698.34] The holy Catholic Church,
[1698.92 → 1700.34] The communion of saints,
[1700.90 → 1702.50] The forgiveness of sins,
[1703.02 → 1704.70] The resurrection of the body,
[1705.24 → 1706.66] And the life everlasting.
[1706.66 → 1709.04] Amen.
[1715.54 → 1717.60] He's our rescuer,
[1718.28 → 1720.92] He's our rescuer,
[1720.92 → 1726.00] We are free from sin forevermore,
[1726.00 → 1729.00] Oh how sweet the sound,
[1729.44 → 1732.02] Oh how grace abounds,
[1732.02 → 1735.94] We will praise the Lord our rescuer
[1735.94 → 1740.56] There is good news for the captive
[1740.56 → 1743.80] Good news for the shame
[1743.80 → 1748.32] There is good news for the one who walked away
[1748.32 → 1753.10] There is good news for the doubter
[1753.10 → 1756.06] The one religion failed
[1756.06 → 1760.98] For the good Lord has come to seek and save
[1760.98 → 1764.12] He's our rescuer
[1764.12 → 1767.18] He's our rescuer
[1767.18 → 1772.38] We are free from sin forevermore
[1772.38 → 1775.26] Oh how sweet the sound
[1775.26 → 1778.34] Oh how grace abounds
[1778.34 → 1782.42] We will praise the Lord our rescuer
[1782.42 → 1787.48] He is beauty for the blind man
[1787.48 → 1790.16] Riches for the poor
[1790.16 → 1795.30] He is friendship for the one the world ignores
[1795.30 → 1799.10] He is friendship for the weary
[1799.10 → 1802.30] Rest for those who strive
[1802.30 → 1807.30] For the good Lord is the way, the truth, the lie
[1807.30 → 1812.44] Yes, the good Lord is the way, the truth, the lie
[1812.44 → 1816.44] He's our rescuer
[1816.44 → 1819.24] He's our rescuer
[1819.24 → 1823.44] We are free from sin forevermore
[1823.44 → 1826.58] Lord, oh how sweet the sound
[1826.58 → 1829.58] Oh how grace abounds
[1829.58 → 1834.58] We will praise the Lord our rescuer
[1834.58 → 1837.84] So come and be shameless
[1837.84 → 1840.90] Come and be fearless
[1840.90 → 1846.38] Come to the foot of Calvary
[1846.38 → 1849.52] There is redemption
[1849.52 → 1850.52] There is redemption
[1850.52 → 1853.52] For every affliction
[1853.52 → 1858.52] Here at the foot of Calvary
[1858.52 → 1874.66] He's our rescuer
[1874.66 → 1886.80] He's our rescuer
[1886.80 → 1889.80] He's our rescuer
[1889.80 → 1890.80] He's our rescuer
[1890.80 → 1893.80] We are free from sin forevermore
[1893.80 → 1898.02] Oh how sweet the sound
[1898.02 → 1901.16] Oh how grace abounds
[1901.16 → 1905.16] We will praise the Lord our rescuer
[1905.16 → 1910.16] We will praise the Lord our rescuer
[1910.16 → 1910.46] We will praise the Lord our rescuer
[1928.02 → 1938.78] Good morning. I'm a deacon here at Emanuel. My name is Brenda.
[1939.52 → 1946.46] And our giving today is for the budget and as well as for New Ground, Diaconal Ministries.
[1946.66 → 1951.90] And I'm going to invite Kim Print to come up and share with us about New Ground.
[1958.02 → 1963.22] Thanks, Kim.
[1969.58 → 1975.36] It's my first time up on the stage, and it feels pretty powerful. So thanks for this opportunity.
[1976.58 → 1983.94] So I am the Western representative for New Ground. It's a diaconal ministry. That's through the CRC church.
[1984.66 → 1987.72] And it used to be formerly known as Operation Manna.
[1988.58 → 1994.02] So I'm going to read a little. Their website succinctly puts it up.
[1994.10 → 1998.38] So I will read that off, and then I'll tell you a little bit why I'm passionate about this ministry.
[1999.02 → 2013.10] So New Ground, previously known as Operation Manna, offers coaching, networking, and resources to churches to address the gaps and break New Ground by starting sustainable community ministries.
[2013.10 → 2021.94] Through the two to three year partnership, New Ground helps churches and ministries set goals and identify areas to evaluate effectiveness.
[2022.82 → 2030.12] Proposals to New Ground must demonstrate a commitment to asset-based community development principles,
[2030.12 → 2041.12] an approach that recognizes the strengths, gifts, talents, and resources of individuals and communities and helps community mobilize and build on these for sustainable development.
[2041.12 → 2052.90] So what I love about New Ground is that they invite people to apply for grants and through those applicants,
[2052.90 → 2058.24] we actually look through who's actually going into the community, assessing what the community is doing,
[2058.24 → 2063.90] and asking the community about what they want for programs to come through.
[2064.30 → 2070.20] Out of that, the applicants create programs based on the information that they get.
[2070.20 → 2073.82] So it's a bottom-top approach, which is beautiful.
[2074.04 → 2078.44] So it actually comes from those who are in the community asking for resources.
[2079.02 → 2081.52] The other beautiful thing about it is that it's strength-based.
[2081.86 → 2085.94] And so it goes in, and it assesses what's going really well in this community.
[2086.22 → 2087.30] What can we build off?
[2088.08 → 2091.34] And the last part that I really love about it is that it's a coaching model.
[2091.80 → 2099.64] So what we do is once we find somebody that we want to give a grant to, we go in and we actually coach them.
[2099.64 → 2113.82] So our committee has about 10 members, two of which are actually youth, one of which of this youth are actually in our community here, Allison Star.
[2114.28 → 2115.50] She's a youth member there.
[2116.50 → 2120.24] And, yeah, we work with those who are applying.
[2120.76 → 2124.08] So the beauty of that is we get to coach them, we get to mentor them.
[2124.70 → 2128.68] We have a lot of experience on our team around bottom-up approaches.
[2128.68 → 2131.60] And so we get to ask some really great questions.
[2132.04 → 2134.78] And then what we do is we give them a bigger grant in the first year.
[2135.08 → 2137.24] The second year, they get a less big grant.
[2137.36 → 2144.76] And the third year, we give an even smaller grant with the idea that hopefully these become self-sustainable without us.
[2145.10 → 2147.16] So there's a great coaching model component to that.
[2147.80 → 2149.24] So that's why I'm passionate about it.
[2149.24 → 2152.40] So please feel free to give what your heart desires.
[2152.40 → 2153.28] Thank you.
[2153.28 → 2153.42] Thank you.
[2153.42 → 2183.40] Thank you.
[2183.42 → 2213.40] Thank you.
[2213.42 → 2215.42] Thank you.
[2243.42 → 2245.42] Thank you.
[2273.42 → 2275.42] Thank you.
[2303.42 → 2305.42] Thank you.
[2333.42 → 2335.42] Thank you.
[2335.42 → 2337.42] Thank you.
[2337.42 → 2339.42] Thank you.
[2339.42 → 2341.42] Thank you.
[2341.42 → 2343.42] Thank you.
[2343.42 → 2345.42] Thank you.
[2345.42 → 2347.42] Thank you.
[2347.42 → 2349.42] Good to see you.
[2349.42 → 2351.42] Thank you.
[2351.42 → 2353.42] Thank you.
[2353.42 → 2356.42] That makes sense!
[2356.42 → 2362.42] Come on up kids, come on up!
[2362.42 → 2364.42] Come sit down!
[2364.42 → 2367.42] Hi everyone!
[2367.42 → 2372.42] That wasn't very loud at all.
[2372.42 → 2374.42] Hi everyone!
[2374.42 → 2377.42] How are you kids doing today?
[2377.42 → 2380.42] How are you Kevin?
[2380.42 → 2383.42] Thanks for asking Hank, I'm doing good too!
[2383.42 → 2385.42] Why are you doing good?
[2385.42 → 2388.42] Well, it's Sunday, and we're in church.
[2388.42 → 2389.42] I had a pretty good weekend.
[2389.42 → 2390.42] I love being in church.
[2390.42 → 2392.42] I love seeing these kids.
[2392.42 → 2394.42] They're so fun!
[2394.42 → 2397.42] I played baseball yesterday and that was fun.
[2397.42 → 2398.42] Wow!
[2398.42 → 2400.42] And the Oilers won last night.
[2400.42 → 2402.42] Who are the Oilers?
[2402.42 → 2403.42] What?
[2403.42 → 2405.42] Who are the Oilers?
[2405.42 → 2407.42] You don't know who the Oilers are?
[2407.42 → 2408.42] Mm-mm.
[2408.42 → 2410.42] Oilers are my favourite hockey team, Hank.
[2410.42 → 2411.42] Oh!
[2411.42 → 2413.42] I don't like the Oilers.
[2413.42 → 2414.42] What?
[2414.42 → 2417.42] How do you not like the Oilers?
[2417.42 → 2418.42] I don't know.
[2418.42 → 2420.42] Well, who's your favourite hockey team?
[2420.42 → 2423.42] Is there a team about sticks?
[2423.42 → 2427.42] They all have sticks, but there's no team called the sticks.
[2427.42 → 2428.42] Hmm.
[2428.42 → 2431.42] There's a team that has leaves on the end of sticks, the Leafs.
[2431.42 → 2432.42] Yeah, I like them!
[2432.42 → 2433.42] What?
[2433.42 → 2436.42] How could you like them?
[2436.42 → 2437.42] I don't know.
[2437.42 → 2438.42] I just think they're cool.
[2438.42 → 2440.42] Hank, I do not like the Leafs.
[2440.42 → 2443.42] Well, that's okay.
[2443.42 → 2444.42] I can like them.
[2444.42 → 2445.42] I guess.
[2445.42 → 2449.42] I just, I didn't think that we had different opinions on things.
[2449.42 → 2450.42] Yeah, me neither.
[2450.42 → 2452.42] Well, you know what?
[2452.42 → 2453.42] I'm sorry.
[2453.42 → 2456.42] You're allowed to like whatever team you want to like, right?
[2456.42 → 2457.42] Yeah.
[2457.42 → 2458.42] Well, do you forgive me for being upset?
[2458.42 → 2459.42] Mm-hmm.
[2459.42 → 2460.42] Mm-hmm.
[2460.42 → 2461.42] You know what?
[2461.42 → 2465.42] This is a good conversation because we're going to talk about what forgiveness is in children's worship time.
[2465.42 → 2466.42] Good!
[2466.42 → 2467.42] You need to learn it!
[2467.42 → 2468.42] Okay, Hank.
[2468.42 → 2469.42] Okay.
[2470.42 → 2471.42] Simmer down.
[2471.42 → 2472.42] We'll talk about that in children's worship time.
[2472.42 → 2473.42] Does that sound good?
[2473.42 → 2474.42] Mm-hmm.
[2474.42 → 2475.42] All right.
[2475.42 → 2477.42] Let's pray, and then we'll stand up and do the blessing.
[2477.42 → 2478.42] Okay?
[2478.42 → 2479.42] Yeah?
[2479.42 → 2480.42] Let's pray.
[2480.42 → 2481.42] Dear God, thank you for this day that we could be in church.
[2481.42 → 2486.42] Thank you that we could learn more about you and more about what it means to forgive other people, Lord.
[2486.42 → 2492.42] Be with the adults as they stay back here and learn about Jonah and be with us as we learn about forgiveness.
[2492.42 → 2495.42] Help us grow closer to you and to each other in this time.
[2495.42 → 2496.42] In your name.
[2496.42 → 2497.42] Amen.
[2497.42 → 2498.42] All right.
[2498.42 → 2499.42] Let's stand up.
[2501.42 → 2502.42] Do you remember what we're going to say?
[2502.42 → 2503.42] We're going to say, the Lord be with you.
[2503.42 → 2504.42] Okay?
[2504.42 → 2505.42] We're going to say that to the church.
[2505.42 → 2506.42] Are you ready?
[2506.42 → 2508.42] The Lord be with you.
[2516.42 → 2531.42] Good morning.
[2531.42 → 2533.42] My name is Darrell.
[2533.42 → 2535.42] I'm one of the elders here.
[2535.42 → 2538.42] Thank you, Pastor Chris, for the very detailed council notes.

[2680.42 → 2684.42] We thank you for the opportunity for families to be reunited.
[2684.42 → 2688.42] We thank you for the gift of baby Liam, welcomed into the Alma home.
[2688.42 → 2692.42] We ask for your blessings upon him as they love and care for him.
[2692.42 → 2697.42] We also pray for Dick Print and Fred Kurtz's mom, who have suffered injuries.
[2697.42 → 2702.42] We ask for your healing touch upon them and for comfort as they navigate the challenges of their recovery.
[2702.42 → 2708.42] We thank you for the positive progress in SAI Kisser's treatments.
[2708.42 → 2712.42] We ask for continued health, strength and resilience for SAI and Greta.
[2712.42 → 2716.42] May they continue to feel the love and support of their church family.
[2716.42 → 2720.42] We lift John and Joanne and John continues facing his battle with cancer.
[2720.42 → 2724.42] May they find solace and strength in their faith, trusting in you.
[2724.42 → 2730.42] We pray for those who are caring for their aging parents.
[2730.42 → 2734.42] We ask for grace to be upon them, giving them patience, compassion and strength.
[2734.42 → 2737.42] We also remember those who mourn the loss of loved ones.
[2737.42 → 2742.42] We ask for your comfort and peace to be upon them, knowing that you are the God of all comfort.
[2742.42 → 2745.42] Pray for those who are broken and hurting.
[2745.42 → 2753.42] Whatever their struggles may be, may they feel your presence, comfort as they navigate their struggles.
[2753.42 → 2757.42] God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble.
[2757.42 → 2763.42] Therefore, we will not fear, though the earth gives way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea.
[2763.42 → 2770.42] May these words bring comfort and peace to those who are facing challenges and remind us of our unwavering love and protection.
[2770.42 → 2777.42] Thank you, Lord, for those who allow their names to stand for elder and deacon, and for those who discerned the decision as well.
[2777.42 → 2781.42] We pray for your wisdom and guidance for those serving in these roles and leading our congregation.
[2781.42 → 2786.42] May they be a blessing to our community, and may we continue to support and encourage them.
[2786.42 → 2794.42] Please be with Pastor Chris as he gives us your word this morning, and may you open our hearts to hear and apply your words to our lives.
[2794.42 → 2797.42] In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[2800.42 → 2829.42] This morning we're going to continue in our close reading of the book of Jonah.
[2829.42 → 2833.42] And so we're going to read this morning from Jonah 3.
[2833.42 → 2838.42] So I invite you, if you have a Bible in your hands, whether it's one that you can open and flip the pages of,
[2838.42 → 2844.42] or one that you can turn on and swipe the pages of, to have that in front of you in Jonah 3,
[2844.42 → 2848.42] as we will be going back pretty regularly this morning.
[2848.42 → 2855.42] It will be on the screen behind me the first time we go through, but then you will be left with it in your hands.
[2855.42 → 2861.42] I'm going to read from Jonah 3 as we begin.
[2861.42 → 2866.42] Then the word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time.
[2866.42 → 2872.42] Go to the great city of Nineveh and proclaim to it the message I give you.
[2872.42 → 2877.42] Jonah obeyed the word of the Lord and went to Nineveh.
[2877.42 → 2882.42] Now, Nineveh was a very large city. It took three days to go through it.
[2882.42 → 2887.42] When Jonah began going a day's journey into the city, proclaiming,
[2887.42 → 2892.42] For 40 days, 40 days more, and Nineveh will be overthrown.
[2892.42 → 2895.42] The Nineveh believed God.
[2895.42 → 2902.42] A fast was proclaimed, and all of them, from the greatest to the least, put on sackcloth.
[2902.42 → 2910.42] When Jonah's warning reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, took off his royal robes,
[2910.42 → 2916.42] covered himself with sackcloth, and sat down in the dust.
[2916.42 → 2921.42] This is the proclamation he issued in Nineveh.
[2921.42 → 2929.42] By the decree of the king and his nobles, do not let people or animals, herds or flocks, taste anything.
[2929.42 → 2936.42] Do not let them eat or drink, but let people and animals be covered with sackcloth.
[2936.42 → 2942.42] Let everyone call urgently on God. Let them give up their evil ways and their violence.
[2942.42 → 2952.42] Who knows? God may yet relent with compassion, and with compassion turn from his fierce anger so that we will not perish.
[2952.42 → 2958.42] When God saw what they did and how they turned from their evil ways,
[2958.42 → 2964.42] he relented and did not bring on them the destruction that he had threatened.
[2964.42 → 2976.42] This is the word of the Lord.
[2976.42 → 2986.42] Now, I'm not as funny as Pastor Kevin, nor am I particularly committed to one hockey team over against another,
[2986.42 → 2994.42] and I will forgive him for that, but he is talking with the youth right now about forgiveness.
[2994.42 → 3005.42] And as Sarah alluded to earlier in our service, the text that we are going to read is about repentance, an important aspect of forgiveness.
[3005.42 → 3013.42] And part of repentance is how we say, I'm sorry.
[3013.42 → 3020.42] Now, some of us have gotten perfect at saying, I'm sorry.
[3020.42 → 3024.42] Most of us are husbands.
[3024.42 → 3031.42] Now, I'm going to have to apologize after church to my wife for that comment.
[3031.42 → 3041.42] Many of us have gotten perfect at saying the words, I'm sorry, but not actually being repentant.
[3041.42 → 3051.42] I heard a story this week from someone who I will leave their name out, but there was a situation that happened in their church,
[3051.42 → 3062.42] and something, a situation occurred, some words were said, and this person left feeling really hurt by the words that were said.
[3062.42 → 3065.42] That's never happened in our church, right?
[3065.42 → 3070.42] Again, let's be honest, it has, right? We all struggle with this.
[3070.42 → 3081.42] The person who said the offensive words found out that their words hurt someone, and they reached out, and they said, I'm sorry that you felt hurt.
[3081.42 → 3083.42] Now, did you hear that?
[3083.42 → 3086.42] Right? I'm sorry you felt hurt.
[3086.42 → 3089.42] I'm not sorry I said something hurtful.
[3089.42 → 3091.42] I'm sorry you felt hurt.
[3091.42 → 3092.42] That's not a real apology.
[3092.42 → 3095.42] That's not real repentance.
[3095.42 → 3096.42] Right?
[3096.42 → 3101.42] This, if you are a parent, and we'll come back to this, you know this, right?
[3101.42 → 3104.42] You ask your kid to do something, they don't do it, and you say, come on!
[3104.42 → 3106.42] And they go, I'm sorry.
[3106.42 → 3110.42] And then they keep on not doing the thing you've asked them to do.
[3110.42 → 3111.42] Right?
[3111.42 → 3117.42] Repentance, real repentance requires a change.
[3117.42 → 3136.42] Now, I believe, and what I hope we will see from Jonah 3, is that there is a parallel to our experience of repentance and forgiveness from God, and in relationship to God, and our living out repentance and forgiveness with each other.
[3136.42 → 3144.42] And so what we see and experience from and with God becomes, for us, the model of experience for each other.
[3144.42 → 3165.42] And so what I hope we will see this morning, our big idea, the theme that we're going to live under, is that only the word of God leads to genuine repentance that includes both saying, I'm sorry, and changing your actions and attitudes.
[3165.42 → 3172.42] So we'll need the word of God, and then we'll need to say, I'm sorry, and then we'll need to do something about it.
[3172.42 → 3178.42] That's Jonah 3.
[3178.42 → 3185.42] Now, a reminder for those of you who weren't here or are new to this story.
[3185.42 → 3195.42] A giant storm had risen up after Jonah had been called by God to go, and he fled and got on a ship and sailed to Tarshish.
[3195.42 → 3206.42] A giant storm had come up, and Jonah was thrown overboard by the mariners, and he spent three days and three nights inside a great fish.
[3206.42 → 3215.42] After that, after he's spit out on the dry land, and this is what Josh looked at last week, that time in the fish and his prayer.
[3215.42 → 3225.42] After that, Jonah hears again the call from the Lord to go to Nineveh, Israel's sworn enemy, and to preach to them.
[3225.42 → 3234.42] In verse 2, the call is very similar to the one that was spoken in chapter 1.
[3234.42 → 3240.42] In chapter 1, if you flip your page over, you can see God says to Jonah,
[3240.42 → 3247.08] Go to the great city of Nineveh and preach against it because its wickedness has come up before me.
[3247.84 → 3250.42] But in chapter 3, God says,
[3251.42 → 3257.30] Go to the great city of Nineveh and proclaim to it the message I give you.
[3257.30 → 3260.06] Now, those differences are important.
[3260.88 → 3266.88] The explicit reference to the wickedness of Nineveh has been dropped.
[3268.22 → 3273.58] And I suggest that's probably in light of the overt disobedience of Jonah.
[3274.72 → 3282.80] Jonah's wickedness is now on par and being highlighted for us more than that of the Ninevite's.
[3282.80 → 3296.04] Because remember, part of the contrast that's being shown in this book is about how people outside of Israel are also going to receive God's mercy.
[3296.98 → 3303.14] We put it this way before, that God's choosing is bigger than Jonah's preferences.
[3303.14 → 3325.30] Now, in this call, it seems like Jonah has less and less freedom or less and less trust from God in the particulars of the message that he is to proclaim.
[3325.60 → 3325.74] Right?
[3325.74 → 3330.98] In the first chapter, he's told to preach against the wickedness.
[3331.08 → 3337.42] And then in the third, where we read, he's told to proclaim the message that the Lord gives him.
[3338.74 → 3340.22] Now, this is really our foundation.
[3340.36 → 3342.84] So, I'm going to just make three points on this.
[3343.84 → 3345.32] I want you to hear that.
[3345.70 → 3350.62] First, God knows Jonah's heart.
[3350.62 → 3351.62] Right?
[3351.62 → 3352.62] Right?
[3352.70 → 3357.12] God knows and can see into the depths of Jonah's being.
[3357.88 → 3364.52] And he knows that left to himself, Jonah probably isn't going to go into Nineveh and speak a word of mercy.
[3366.00 → 3366.60] Right?
[3366.66 → 3370.58] Or the intent behind what Jonah says isn't going to be repentance.
[3371.22 → 3372.94] He's hoping for their destruction.
[3372.94 → 3381.08] God knows Jonah's heart, but God wants his own heart, God's own heart, to be revealed.
[3382.40 → 3382.52] Right?
[3382.58 → 3392.50] And the point of this message to the Ninevite's, right, is to show that God is slow to anger and abounding in love.
[3392.58 → 3394.84] That God is gracious and compassionate.
[3394.84 → 3399.52] The message of Jonah is that God will have mercy on whom he has mercy.
[3399.52 → 3403.22] And Jonah doesn't like that message.
[3403.88 → 3405.88] At least, not for his enemies.
[3406.52 → 3406.62] Right?
[3406.70 → 3409.16] Jonah would prefer calamity and destruction.
[3410.18 → 3411.98] But that's exactly the point.
[3413.04 → 3413.14] Right?
[3413.24 → 3416.36] God's mercy is granted to his enemies.
[3416.80 → 3423.20] And Jonah may not like it, but like Josh said so perfectly last week, he needs that same message.
[3423.68 → 3428.36] Jonah needs that same message because he, like all of us, apart from God's intervening,
[3428.36 → 3432.62] has a natural tendency, the catechism says, to hate God and to hate neighbour.
[3433.26 → 3433.38] Right?
[3433.42 → 3436.62] In his heart, Jonah is an enemy of God.
[3437.20 → 3438.64] And we too, right?
[3438.68 → 3440.24] We need this message.
[3441.42 → 3443.92] Romans 5, verse 10 says,
[3443.92 → 3450.56] For if, while we were God's enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his son,
[3450.56 → 3456.62] how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life?
[3457.96 → 3460.08] God's mercy is for his enemies.
[3460.74 → 3463.32] That's what's so amazing about grace.
[3463.68 → 3463.80] Right?
[3463.84 → 3468.16] That grace and mercy, they take an enemy, and they make it a friend.
[3469.44 → 3473.78] Grace and mercy takes an enemy and makes it a brother or a sister.
[3473.78 → 3481.80] Grace from God, mercy from God, takes an enemy and makes it an heir of God and co-heirs with Christ.
[3481.92 → 3484.34] And we all need that message.
[3486.20 → 3490.44] That's something worth worshipping over.
[3490.56 → 3494.92] That's something worth celebrating as we hear and receive from God.
[3494.92 → 3501.72] And God wants to make sure that that is what's going on in Jonah's proclamation.
[3502.30 → 3505.20] The second thing, then, on this point,
[3506.54 → 3511.64] is that God wants us to see the power of his word.
[3512.54 → 3513.56] God says to Jonah,
[3513.98 → 3518.14] Go and proclaim the message I give you.
[3519.00 → 3521.54] And then immediately in the next verse, it says,
[3521.96 → 3524.54] Jonah obeyed the word of the Lord.
[3524.92 → 3528.26] And then in verse 5, if your Bibles are open, you can see it.
[3528.32 → 3528.82] It says,
[3529.10 → 3531.40] The Ninevite's believed God.
[3533.46 → 3542.04] God is working and active in the world through his word.
[3543.26 → 3547.56] The cause of repentance is God's word.
[3547.78 → 3552.00] And whether it concludes in repentance and God's mercy,
[3552.00 → 3554.96] or it concludes, like in some other cases,
[3555.40 → 3557.40] in obstinance and God's judgment,
[3557.84 → 3561.24] what we see is that God's word is effective.
[3563.08 → 3566.44] One of my favourite passages in all Scripture is Isaiah 55.
[3567.32 → 3570.14] The last couple verses in Isaiah 55,
[3570.14 → 3571.54] verse 10 and 11, they say,
[3571.54 → 3575.40] As the rain and the snow come down from heaven
[3575.40 → 3578.28] and do not return to it without watering the earth
[3578.28 → 3581.52] and making it bud and flourish so that it yields seed for the sower
[3581.52 → 3582.54] and bread for the eater,
[3583.16 → 3586.86] so is my word that goes out from my mouth.
[3587.32 → 3588.96] It will not return to me empty,
[3589.32 → 3591.92] but will accomplish what I desire
[3591.92 → 3595.80] and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.
[3596.96 → 3600.20] God's word is living and active.
[3600.76 → 3603.40] God's word is his revelation of himself.
[3603.90 → 3606.48] And by the working of the Holy Spirit in you,
[3606.62 → 3610.36] God uses his word to accomplish his will,
[3610.52 → 3612.58] to accomplish what he desires,
[3612.76 → 3616.58] to achieve the purposes for which he sends it out.
[3616.58 → 3620.42] And that purpose may be the forgiving of sins,
[3620.58 → 3622.44] may be the repentance of nations,
[3622.62 → 3626.14] or that purpose may be his word of judgment over them,
[3626.22 → 3629.28] but his word is always effective.
[3633.80 → 3637.38] People will often ask me questions
[3637.38 → 3640.26] and they'll talk to me about, you know,
[3640.30 → 3642.26] conversations that they have with their friends
[3642.26 → 3643.54] or their co-workers,
[3643.54 → 3646.50] and like in mission sort of settings.
[3646.58 → 3646.86] Right?
[3646.92 → 3648.86] In evangelistic kind of settings.
[3648.98 → 3651.76] Like, what if I don't have the right words?
[3651.94 → 3653.16] What am I supposed to say?
[3654.16 → 3655.20] To which I just want to say,
[3655.80 → 3656.16] Scripture!
[3657.42 → 3659.64] Like you have God's word in front of you.
[3659.74 → 3660.66] Open God's word.
[3661.04 → 3662.14] Read Scripture together.
[3662.82 → 3663.00] Right?
[3663.02 → 3665.28] It's God's word that transforms hearts
[3665.28 → 3666.72] and minds and lives.
[3666.90 → 3667.86] It's God's gospel.
[3668.04 → 3669.84] It's the proclamation of Jesus Christ
[3669.84 → 3671.58] that turns hearts of stones
[3671.58 → 3673.52] into hearts of flesh.
[3673.52 → 3675.90] And so, preach the word in season
[3675.90 → 3677.02] and out of season,
[3677.02 → 3678.22] like Paul says to Timothy.
[3678.58 → 3681.72] Be Always prepared to preach the gospel.
[3682.70 → 3684.16] And then as you are preaching,
[3684.40 → 3687.14] remember that the word took on flesh.
[3688.30 → 3688.44] Right?
[3688.46 → 3690.26] That like Peter says to Jesus,
[3690.66 → 3692.12] that you, Lord Jesus,
[3692.24 → 3694.50] have the words of eternal life.
[3695.26 → 3695.40] Right?
[3695.44 → 3697.16] When we proclaim the word,
[3697.48 → 3700.06] when we speak the word to people,
[3700.06 → 3702.80] all we are doing is revealing Jesus.
[3704.14 → 3705.44] All we are trying to do
[3705.44 → 3707.96] is introduced people to Jesus.
[3709.14 → 3711.46] In all your conversations then,
[3711.76 → 3713.68] right, the word will be effective
[3713.68 → 3717.72] when used to reveal God through Jesus.
[3719.40 → 3722.02] And then one last thing on this point,
[3722.12 → 3722.88] this same point here.
[3723.88 → 3726.12] In order to preach the word,
[3726.12 → 3729.66] you need to know the word.
[3732.20 → 3735.92] If Jesus has the words of eternal life,
[3736.22 → 3737.74] if Jesus is the word
[3737.74 → 3739.74] that has taken on flesh,
[3739.84 → 3741.16] if all scripture,
[3741.70 → 3742.98] the law and the prophets,
[3743.18 → 3744.44] point to Jesus,
[3744.64 → 3747.36] and our job is to reveal Jesus,
[3748.14 → 3749.46] how much more than
[3749.46 → 3752.04] should you and I be in the word?
[3752.04 → 3754.96] And let me be clear,
[3755.06 → 3756.82] I don't say this to guilt you
[3756.82 → 3758.44] into reading the Bible more,
[3758.96 → 3760.20] because that's not going to be effective.
[3760.40 → 3762.50] Guilt doesn't motivate in that kind of way.
[3763.10 → 3764.72] But what I hope happens
[3764.72 → 3765.94] is that you are inspired
[3765.94 → 3768.12] to read the Bible more.
[3769.10 → 3771.14] Because if you read the Bible more,
[3771.22 → 3772.76] your closeness to God
[3772.76 → 3774.50] will just be magnified and grown.
[3775.22 → 3776.86] If you read the Bible more,
[3776.94 → 3778.86] your prayer life will be deepened
[3778.86 → 3781.06] as you take on the words of scripture
[3781.06 → 3782.60] in your own prayers.
[3784.02 → 3784.22] Right?
[3784.26 → 3785.76] If you read the Bible more,
[3785.86 → 3787.98] your ability to talk to Jesus
[3787.98 → 3789.16] with some confidence
[3789.16 → 3790.52] and some conviction
[3790.52 → 3791.52] will be heightened.
[3794.06 → 3795.38] If you are right now
[3795.38 → 3798.00] experiencing a crisis of faith,
[3798.08 → 3799.16] if you are right now
[3799.16 → 3801.18] struggling in the midst of doubt,
[3801.54 → 3803.92] you don't need more Christian podcasts
[3803.92 → 3805.48] or more Christian books.
[3805.68 → 3807.02] You need more of the word.
[3808.50 → 3809.68] And don't get me wrong,
[3809.78 → 3810.78] Josh, I saw that face.
[3810.78 → 3812.26] I love Christian podcasts.
[3813.22 → 3814.90] And I love Christian books.
[3815.60 → 3815.80] Right?
[3815.84 → 3817.38] I listen to, and I read a lot.
[3818.76 → 3820.18] But what I need
[3820.18 → 3821.66] in those moments of doubt
[3821.66 → 3823.00] and of trial and of crisis,
[3823.42 → 3824.56] in my heart of hearts,
[3824.64 → 3826.08] what I need is more of Jesus.
[3827.08 → 3828.42] And I find him
[3828.42 → 3829.70] most clearly
[3829.70 → 3831.80] on the pages of God's revelation
[3831.80 → 3832.42] to the world.
[3833.30 → 3834.58] Now all of those other things
[3834.58 → 3835.66] are good supplements
[3835.66 → 3837.32] to what needs to be
[3837.32 → 3838.74] a diet filled
[3838.74 → 3840.40] with the word of God.
[3842.48 → 3842.92] Lastly,
[3843.12 → 3844.64] on this first point,
[3844.70 → 3845.18] number three,
[3845.88 → 3846.76] from verse two
[3846.76 → 3847.76] on the Lord
[3847.76 → 3849.00] giving Jonah a message.
[3850.46 → 3852.18] God gives Jonah a message.
[3854.28 → 3855.70] Now have you ever had it, right,
[3855.76 → 3857.18] where you're talking to someone,
[3857.26 → 3858.78] you're in one of those conversations,
[3858.78 → 3860.76] and they ask you a question
[3860.76 → 3861.44] and somehow
[3861.44 → 3863.20] you give them an answer
[3863.20 → 3864.26] that you don't know
[3864.26 → 3865.00] where it came from
[3865.00 → 3866.10] and it's beautiful
[3866.10 → 3867.08] and it's compelling
[3867.08 → 3867.76] and
[3867.76 → 3870.56] that's God
[3870.56 → 3871.84] giving you the words.
[3871.94 → 3872.44] That's God
[3872.44 → 3873.26] being faithful
[3873.26 → 3874.70] to his promise.
[3875.22 → 3875.62] Right?
[3875.72 → 3876.50] Jesus says
[3876.50 → 3877.22] this same thing
[3877.22 → 3877.98] to his disciples
[3877.98 → 3879.14] in Luke 12.
[3879.30 → 3879.68] He says,
[3879.68 → 3881.30] when you are brought
[3881.30 → 3882.54] before synagogues,
[3882.66 → 3882.96] rulers,
[3883.24 → 3883.92] and authorities,
[3884.36 → 3885.00] or friends,
[3885.18 → 3885.92] or colleagues,
[3886.10 → 3886.84] or the like,
[3886.96 → 3887.92] or your children,
[3888.08 → 3888.80] or your parents,
[3888.90 → 3889.76] whatever that is,
[3889.82 → 3890.50] when you are brought
[3890.50 → 3891.26] in front of people,
[3891.44 → 3892.26] do not worry
[3892.26 → 3892.94] about how you will
[3892.94 → 3893.66] defend yourselves
[3893.66 → 3894.58] or what you will say
[3894.58 → 3896.24] for the Holy Spirit
[3896.24 → 3897.04] will teach you
[3897.04 → 3897.96] at that time
[3897.96 → 3899.86] what you should say.
[3901.60 → 3902.08] Now,
[3902.60 → 3904.32] don't hear
[3904.32 → 3905.10] what I'm not saying.
[3905.50 → 3905.62] Right?
[3905.68 → 3906.72] This doesn't give you
[3906.72 → 3907.32] a license
[3907.32 → 3908.82] to say whatever crazy
[3908.82 → 3910.18] or ludicrous thing
[3910.18 → 3911.50] comes to your mind
[3911.50 → 3911.98] when you're having
[3911.98 → 3912.54] conversations
[3912.54 → 3913.74] with your friends.
[3914.54 → 3915.46] That's how heresies
[3915.46 → 3915.86] are born.
[3917.00 → 3918.36] But if your life
[3918.36 → 3919.24] is seasoned
[3919.24 → 3921.22] with a well-fed
[3921.22 → 3923.00] diet of the word,
[3923.10 → 3923.78] if your heart
[3923.78 → 3924.38] is open
[3924.38 → 3925.26] to the spirit,
[3925.38 → 3925.98] you will hear
[3925.98 → 3926.58] God's voice
[3926.58 → 3927.82] as he speaks to you
[3927.82 → 3929.06] through his word
[3929.06 → 3929.98] and he will
[3929.98 → 3931.72] plant in your mind
[3931.72 → 3932.46] that idea
[3932.46 → 3933.38] that can grow
[3933.38 → 3935.86] into his truth.
[3937.44 → 3937.80] And that,
[3938.10 → 3938.54] my friends,
[3938.54 → 3940.32] is how you know
[3940.32 → 3941.78] that what you say
[3941.78 → 3942.72] is actually
[3942.72 → 3944.06] from the Lord
[3944.06 → 3945.68] because it's tested
[3945.68 → 3946.82] against the Scriptures.
[3948.32 → 3948.44] Right?
[3948.50 → 3949.78] God will never
[3949.78 → 3951.02] contradict himself.
[3952.22 → 3952.90] He can't.
[3953.16 → 3953.96] It is contrary
[3953.96 → 3955.48] to his being
[3955.48 → 3956.40] to do so.
[3957.10 → 3957.46] And so,
[3957.52 → 3958.58] his revelation
[3958.58 → 3960.40] to another
[3960.40 → 3961.68] through you
[3961.68 → 3962.86] will always
[3962.86 → 3964.32] be in line
[3964.32 → 3965.64] with his revelation
[3965.64 → 3966.94] through his word.
[3966.94 → 3969.38] God doesn't
[3969.38 → 3970.54] contradict himself.
[3971.72 → 3972.72] And so,
[3972.86 → 3974.14] as you speak,
[3975.14 → 3976.18] be seasoned
[3976.18 → 3977.02] with the word
[3977.02 → 3977.82] so that you
[3977.82 → 3978.62] don't turn God
[3978.62 → 3979.56] into a contradiction.
[3983.28 → 3984.54] We need
[3984.54 → 3986.16] the word of God
[3986.16 → 3987.26] as the ground
[3987.26 → 3988.22] of our repentance.
[3988.46 → 3989.62] That's the first step.
[3989.72 → 3990.12] Let's go back
[3990.12 → 3990.62] to the story.
[3992.22 → 3993.10] Jonah hears
[3993.10 → 3994.38] the call of God
[3994.38 → 3995.68] and he obeys.
[3996.28 → 3996.96] And we're told
[3996.96 → 3998.12] that Nineveh
[3998.12 → 3999.10] is a large city
[3999.10 → 4000.58] taking some three days
[4000.58 → 4001.36] to walk through it.
[4001.40 → 4002.18] And then we're told
[4002.18 → 4003.50] in verse 4,
[4004.28 → 4005.00] Jonah began
[4005.00 → 4005.58] by going
[4005.58 → 4006.56] a day's journey
[4006.56 → 4007.38] into the city
[4007.38 → 4008.52] proclaiming.
[4009.84 → 4011.12] What we're not told
[4011.12 → 4011.96] is if he went
[4011.96 → 4012.48] any further.
[4013.90 → 4014.42] Right?
[4014.42 → 4014.82] We don't know
[4014.82 → 4015.42] how much
[4015.42 → 4016.68] more he
[4016.68 → 4017.36] proclaimed
[4017.36 → 4018.30] that message
[4018.30 → 4019.36] or how
[4019.36 → 4020.26] comprehensive
[4020.26 → 4021.02] he was.
[4021.22 → 4021.68] We don't know
[4021.68 → 4022.18] how hard
[4022.18 → 4022.82] he tried
[4022.82 → 4023.52] in his act
[4023.52 → 4024.48] of obedience.
[4024.74 → 4025.14] In fact,
[4025.86 → 4026.72] what seems clear,
[4026.86 → 4027.46] especially if you
[4027.46 → 4028.38] read this
[4028.38 → 4028.90] in the Hebrew
[4028.90 → 4029.46] structure,
[4029.98 → 4030.50] is that
[4030.50 → 4031.66] Jonah's response,
[4031.82 → 4032.38] his obedience,
[4032.38 → 4033.12] is pretty
[4033.12 → 4034.30] lackadaisical
[4034.30 → 4035.14] and half-hearted.
[4036.18 → 4036.64] Like,
[4036.66 → 4037.20] he doesn't really
[4037.20 → 4038.16] want to continue
[4038.16 → 4039.44] his proclaiming.
[4039.96 → 4040.56] The city
[4040.56 → 4041.68] is large,
[4041.88 → 4042.10] right?
[4042.12 → 4042.48] It would take
[4042.48 → 4043.30] three days to get
[4043.30 → 4044.24] through, we are told,
[4044.42 → 4045.72] and we only hear
[4045.72 → 4046.92] Jonah going a third
[4046.92 → 4047.66] of the way through.
[4049.02 → 4049.72] His obedience
[4049.72 → 4050.48] is minimal
[4050.48 → 4051.60] and probably
[4051.60 → 4052.42] begrudging.
[4053.86 → 4054.58] And yet,
[4055.12 → 4055.86] what does it say?
[4056.32 → 4057.14] The Ninevite's
[4057.14 → 4059.02] believed God.
[4060.14 → 4061.38] And their response
[4061.38 → 4062.30] to the word of God
[4062.30 → 4063.04] coming to them
[4063.04 → 4064.20] is in direct
[4064.20 → 4064.78] contrast
[4064.78 → 4066.26] to Jonah's response.
[4067.02 → 4067.56] Where Jonah
[4067.56 → 4068.26] ran away
[4068.26 → 4069.10] and then only
[4069.10 → 4069.86] begrudgingly
[4069.86 → 4070.30] obeyed,
[4070.38 → 4071.04] the Ninevite's
[4071.04 → 4072.24] believed God
[4072.24 → 4072.64] and then they
[4072.64 → 4073.70] proclaim a fast
[4073.70 → 4075.34] for all of them
[4075.34 → 4076.00] from the greatest
[4076.00 → 4076.86] to the least,
[4077.18 → 4077.30] right?
[4077.30 → 4078.58] They put on sackcloth.
[4078.94 → 4079.92] They respond
[4079.92 → 4080.76] with repentance.
[4081.50 → 4082.58] They experience
[4082.58 → 4083.62] what we can only
[4083.62 → 4084.24] conclude
[4084.24 → 4085.64] is genuine
[4085.64 → 4086.50] sorrow
[4086.50 → 4087.80] in hearing
[4087.80 → 4088.64] the word of God.
[4089.10 → 4089.88] And it's not just
[4089.88 → 4090.26] the people
[4090.26 → 4090.88] at the bottom,
[4092.18 → 4092.40] right?
[4092.44 → 4093.18] Not just the bottom
[4093.18 → 4094.10] of the social hierarchy,
[4094.10 → 4094.86] but it's all the way
[4094.86 → 4095.52] up to the top.
[4095.66 → 4096.32] Verse 6 says,
[4096.70 → 4097.68] when Jonah's warning
[4097.68 → 4098.72] reached the king
[4098.72 → 4099.72] of Nineveh,
[4099.84 → 4101.28] he rose from his throne,
[4101.42 → 4102.54] took off his royal robes,
[4102.54 → 4103.22] covered himself
[4103.22 → 4103.94] with sackcloth,
[4104.14 → 4105.08] and sat down
[4105.08 → 4106.16] in the dust.
[4107.36 → 4107.88] Now notice,
[4108.04 → 4108.30] again,
[4108.42 → 4108.56] there,
[4108.66 → 4108.82] right,
[4109.24 → 4111.08] that Jonah's warning
[4111.08 → 4112.38] reached the king
[4112.38 → 4112.88] of Nineveh.
[4113.28 → 4114.22] It's very passive
[4114.22 → 4115.20] on Jonah's part.
[4115.90 → 4116.28] This, again,
[4116.40 → 4117.28] speaks to the fact
[4117.28 → 4119.26] that he's lacklustrally
[4119.26 → 4121.08] living out his call.
[4121.18 → 4121.76] His obedience
[4121.76 → 4123.34] is only half-hearted.
[4123.48 → 4124.40] He didn't get the message
[4124.40 → 4124.96] to the king.
[4125.12 → 4125.90] He didn't proclaim
[4125.90 → 4126.72] the message to him.
[4126.94 → 4127.76] His message only
[4127.76 → 4128.66] reached the king.
[4129.48 → 4130.40] But still,
[4130.88 → 4131.98] the word of the Lord
[4131.98 → 4133.32] is effective.
[4134.40 → 4134.50] Right?
[4134.54 → 4135.26] The king's heart
[4135.26 → 4136.30] is transformed
[4136.30 → 4137.58] by what he hears.
[4137.76 → 4138.86] And he issues a decree
[4138.86 → 4140.28] that not only he
[4140.28 → 4140.98] or the people,
[4141.08 → 4142.40] but even the animals,
[4142.84 → 4143.00] right,
[4143.06 → 4143.60] the herds
[4143.60 → 4144.50] and the flocks
[4144.50 → 4145.62] are called to fast.
[4145.72 → 4147.24] This is very strange
[4147.24 → 4148.48] in the rest of Scripture.
[4149.74 → 4149.92] Right?
[4149.96 → 4150.90] That all the people
[4150.90 → 4152.02] and all the animals
[4152.02 → 4153.42] are covered with sackcloth,
[4153.48 → 4153.98] I think,
[4154.18 → 4154.90] is to show
[4154.90 → 4155.84] that this repentance
[4155.84 → 4158.12] is utter and comprehensive.
[4158.64 → 4160.00] It applies to everyone
[4160.00 → 4161.40] that the whole city,
[4162.22 → 4163.24] not just the people,
[4163.34 → 4164.78] but even like the industry,
[4165.28 → 4165.42] right,
[4165.46 → 4166.30] even the things
[4166.30 → 4167.02] that they do,
[4167.20 → 4168.76] the whole city
[4168.76 → 4171.06] is turning towards God.
[4173.66 → 4175.72] This is what genuine sorrow
[4175.72 → 4177.10] over sin
[4177.10 → 4178.46] and genuine repentance
[4178.46 → 4180.04] looks like.
[4180.66 → 4182.16] Not only do you cry out
[4182.16 → 4182.78] in forgiveness
[4182.78 → 4184.24] and say,
[4184.40 → 4184.92] I'm sorry,
[4185.76 → 4186.74] but you turn away
[4186.74 → 4187.38] from the sin.
[4188.84 → 4189.88] The king's decree
[4189.88 → 4192.26] said in verse 8,
[4192.46 → 4193.56] let everyone call
[4193.56 → 4194.66] urgently on God.
[4194.80 → 4195.28] Cry out,
[4195.42 → 4195.98] I'm sorry.
[4196.92 → 4197.52] God's calling.
[4199.74 → 4200.94] Let everyone call
[4200.94 → 4202.08] urgently on God.
[4202.36 → 4203.06] And then,
[4203.30 → 4204.50] we respond,
[4205.16 → 4205.88] let them give up
[4205.88 → 4206.76] their evil ways
[4206.76 → 4208.04] and their violence.
[4209.46 → 4210.52] Genuine repentance
[4210.52 → 4211.48] requires
[4211.48 → 4212.82] that we ask
[4212.82 → 4213.48] for forgiveness,
[4213.74 → 4214.70] but also
[4214.70 → 4216.00] that we turn away
[4216.00 → 4216.74] from the thing
[4216.74 → 4217.44] that we need
[4217.44 → 4218.48] to be forgiven for.
[4218.68 → 4219.92] And that turning away
[4219.92 → 4220.66] is really
[4220.66 → 4221.94] the hard part
[4221.94 → 4222.76] of repentance.
[4224.64 → 4225.86] But there's hope
[4225.86 → 4227.02] for us
[4227.02 → 4228.06] in this.
[4228.96 → 4229.44] Verse 10,
[4230.02 → 4231.40] when God saw
[4231.40 → 4232.24] what they did
[4232.24 → 4233.02] and how they turned
[4233.02 → 4234.10] from their evil ways,
[4234.52 → 4235.36] he relented.
[4237.36 → 4238.90] God saw what they did
[4238.90 → 4240.34] and how they turned
[4240.34 → 4241.88] from their evil ways
[4241.88 → 4243.46] and so he relented.
[4245.08 → 4245.78] It's not
[4245.78 → 4247.54] that their rituals
[4247.54 → 4249.58] convinced God
[4249.58 → 4250.74] to offer
[4250.74 → 4251.78] his forgiveness,
[4252.28 → 4254.10] but their ethical
[4254.10 → 4255.00] transformation,
[4255.24 → 4255.74] their change
[4255.74 → 4256.70] of behaviour,
[4257.50 → 4257.76] right,
[4257.82 → 4258.72] that caught his attention,
[4258.80 → 4259.10] that showed
[4259.10 → 4260.14] that it was real.
[4261.10 → 4261.74] And that's where
[4261.74 → 4262.70] the contrast
[4262.70 → 4264.72] between Nineveh
[4264.72 → 4265.76] and Jonah
[4265.76 → 4267.10] is highlighted.
[4267.10 → 4268.16] Right?
[4268.26 → 4269.42] The Ninevite's'
[4270.12 → 4270.62] repentance
[4270.62 → 4272.14] extends to
[4272.14 → 4273.30] the attitudes
[4273.30 → 4274.46] and actions
[4274.46 → 4275.58] of all the people
[4275.58 → 4276.50] from the bottom
[4276.50 → 4277.28] to the top.
[4278.28 → 4279.18] Jonah's repentance
[4279.18 → 4280.38] is focused
[4280.38 → 4282.00] on the rituals,
[4282.38 → 4283.52] on the sacrifices
[4283.52 → 4284.72] and the vows
[4284.72 → 4286.06] that he will make.
[4286.14 → 4286.68] We saw that
[4286.68 → 4288.28] in chapter 2.
[4289.50 → 4290.58] Genuine repentance
[4290.58 → 4291.90] leads to
[4291.90 → 4293.42] and requires
[4293.42 → 4294.50] a change
[4294.50 → 4295.08] of behaviour.
[4295.08 → 4295.60] behaviour.
[4295.84 → 4296.34] No amount
[4296.34 → 4296.96] of saying
[4296.96 → 4297.66] I'm sorry
[4297.66 → 4298.24] or even
[4298.24 → 4298.66] praying
[4298.66 → 4299.16] the right
[4299.16 → 4299.68] prayers
[4299.68 → 4300.64] will do it.
[4300.74 → 4301.06] You've got
[4301.06 → 4301.46] to turn
[4301.46 → 4301.94] away
[4301.94 → 4302.72] from the
[4302.72 → 4303.18] behaviour.
[4304.80 → 4305.50] And so,
[4305.68 → 4306.44] we've made
[4306.44 → 4307.16] this point already.
[4307.28 → 4307.70] Let's say
[4307.70 → 4308.14] that you're
[4308.14 → 4308.82] a young kid,
[4309.66 → 4309.90] right,
[4309.94 → 4310.78] and your parents
[4310.78 → 4311.52] ask you
[4311.52 → 4311.98] to go
[4311.98 → 4312.98] clean your room
[4312.98 → 4314.48] and you say,
[4314.62 → 4314.74] yeah,
[4314.78 → 4315.02] mom,
[4315.24 → 4316.32] I'll go do it.
[4317.28 → 4318.18] An hour later,
[4318.28 → 4319.16] dad checks in
[4319.16 → 4320.04] and he says,
[4320.42 → 4320.90] come on,
[4320.94 → 4321.18] dude,
[4321.30 → 4322.06] you said you'd
[4322.06 → 4322.46] clean it.
[4322.46 → 4323.76] It looks worse
[4323.76 → 4324.52] than when you
[4324.52 → 4324.94] went in here
[4324.94 → 4325.58] an hour ago.
[4326.12 → 4327.30] And then you say,
[4327.60 → 4328.46] I'm sorry.
[4329.78 → 4330.58] But you make
[4330.58 → 4330.94] no move
[4330.94 → 4331.62] to start cleaning.
[4333.30 → 4334.58] At that moment,
[4335.14 → 4335.82] your sorry
[4335.82 → 4336.82] doesn't mean
[4336.82 → 4337.36] a lot.
[4338.44 → 4339.56] It's just words.
[4341.76 → 4342.34] Now,
[4342.52 → 4344.34] that's an easy
[4344.34 → 4345.22] example,
[4345.42 → 4345.78] but really,
[4345.88 → 4346.82] we can zoom out
[4346.82 → 4347.92] and we can apply
[4347.92 → 4349.48] this to anything.
[4349.48 → 4351.50] There are so
[4351.50 → 4352.18] many circumstances
[4352.18 → 4352.92] in your own life
[4352.92 → 4353.40] and in your own
[4353.40 → 4353.86] relationships
[4353.86 → 4354.42] where you can be
[4354.42 → 4354.62] like,
[4354.88 → 4355.14] hmm,
[4355.38 → 4356.18] I wonder
[4356.18 → 4356.88] if I'm
[4356.88 → 4357.36] genuinely
[4357.36 → 4358.54] sorry.
[4359.94 → 4360.66] And actually,
[4360.82 → 4361.12] I'm going to
[4361.12 → 4361.54] challenge you,
[4361.66 → 4363.52] if you really
[4363.52 → 4364.04] wonder
[4364.04 → 4364.96] whether
[4364.96 → 4365.68] your sorry
[4365.68 → 4366.88] means anything,
[4367.84 → 4368.82] ask the people
[4368.82 → 4369.72] you say sorry
[4369.72 → 4370.00] to.
[4371.64 → 4372.48] I dare you.
[4374.08 → 4374.94] Ask if they
[4374.94 → 4375.96] feel like
[4375.96 → 4376.82] your sorry
[4376.82 → 4377.96] means something.
[4379.48 → 4380.18] Now,
[4380.20 → 4380.54] that might be
[4380.54 → 4381.14] terrifying,
[4381.58 → 4383.10] but if you're
[4383.10 → 4383.72] willing to take
[4383.72 → 4384.38] the risk,
[4384.74 → 4385.52] you will find
[4385.52 → 4386.76] out very quickly
[4386.76 → 4388.94] if people
[4388.94 → 4389.92] experience
[4389.92 → 4391.10] your apologies,
[4391.58 → 4392.44] your sorry,
[4392.84 → 4393.66] as connected
[4393.66 → 4394.64] to genuine
[4394.64 → 4395.60] repentance,
[4396.78 → 4397.52] that it's connected
[4397.52 → 4398.26] to a genuine
[4398.26 → 4399.90] change of behaviour.
[4401.32 → 4402.38] But again,
[4402.64 → 4403.92] there's good news
[4403.92 → 4404.64] for us
[4404.64 → 4405.40] here.
[4406.32 → 4406.80] Verse 10
[4406.80 → 4407.34] continues,
[4407.34 → 4408.46] that when God
[4408.46 → 4409.74] saw what they
[4409.74 → 4410.48] did and how
[4410.48 → 4411.12] they turned
[4411.12 → 4411.66] from their
[4411.66 → 4412.42] evil ways,
[4412.78 → 4413.52] God relented
[4413.52 → 4414.62] and did not
[4414.62 → 4415.52] bring on them
[4415.52 → 4416.30] the destruction
[4416.30 → 4417.56] he had
[4417.56 → 4418.22] threatened.
[4419.38 → 4420.40] God relented
[4420.40 → 4421.40] and did not
[4421.40 → 4421.98] bring on them
[4421.98 → 4422.64] the destruction
[4422.64 → 4423.82] that he had
[4423.82 → 4424.12] threatened.
[4425.26 → 4426.06] This is an
[4426.06 → 4427.00] amazing parallel.
[4427.76 → 4429.04] In Exodus 32,
[4429.94 → 4430.88] you read a story
[4430.88 → 4431.88] about the Israelites.
[4432.06 → 4432.84] They have come
[4432.84 → 4433.44] out of Egypt,
[4433.96 → 4435.06] they have crossed
[4435.06 → 4435.74] the Red Sea,
[4435.74 → 4436.34] they have come
[4436.34 → 4437.38] to Mount Sinai,
[4437.54 → 4438.70] Moses has gone
[4438.70 → 4439.56] up, and he spent
[4439.56 → 4441.36] 40 days with God,
[4441.42 → 4442.04] he has received
[4442.04 → 4442.90] the Ten Commandments
[4442.90 → 4443.54] and while Moses
[4443.54 → 4444.16] is up there,
[4444.50 → 4444.98] the Israelites
[4444.98 → 4445.98] make a golden
[4445.98 → 4446.64] calf.
[4447.38 → 4448.32] They make an idol
[4448.32 → 4448.94] for themselves
[4448.94 → 4449.96] and they worship.
[4450.40 → 4451.40] Moses comes down
[4451.40 → 4452.28] and he sees that
[4452.28 → 4453.00] and he smashes
[4453.00 → 4453.62] the tablets
[4453.62 → 4455.26] and God promises
[4455.26 → 4456.36] to destroy
[4456.36 → 4457.08] the Israelites.
[4457.62 → 4458.04] So Moses,
[4458.22 → 4459.00] back up the mountain,
[4459.14 → 4459.72] he goes and he
[4459.72 → 4461.12] intercedes on behalf
[4461.12 → 4462.28] of the Israelites
[4462.28 → 4462.54] saying,
[4462.66 → 4463.24] please Lord,
[4463.50 → 4464.02] what would the
[4464.02 → 4464.74] Egyptians think
[4464.74 → 4465.42] if you killed them?
[4465.52 → 4466.40] Moses goes up
[4466.40 → 4467.74] and in Exodus 32,
[4467.98 → 4468.56] verse 14,
[4468.64 → 4469.14] and we'll see it
[4469.14 → 4469.56] on the screen
[4469.56 → 4470.48] in contrast,
[4471.14 → 4471.64] it says,
[4472.60 → 4473.66] the Lord relented
[4473.66 → 4475.08] and did not bring
[4475.08 → 4475.84] on his people
[4475.84 → 4476.64] the destruction
[4476.64 → 4478.38] he had threatened.
[4481.26 → 4482.22] You better believe
[4482.22 → 4482.66] that the author
[4482.66 → 4483.14] of Jonah
[4483.14 → 4484.78] has in mind
[4484.78 → 4485.76] the author
[4485.76 → 4486.68] of Exodus 32
[4486.68 → 4487.68] when he says this.
[4488.44 → 4489.84] The almost exact
[4489.84 → 4490.70] similarity
[4490.70 → 4492.48] between these two texts
[4492.48 → 4493.68] shows to us,
[4493.76 → 4494.72] reminds us again,
[4494.74 → 4496.46] that Yahweh's mercy
[4496.46 → 4497.98] is not exclusively
[4497.98 → 4499.54] for Israel.
[4501.10 → 4501.76] One person
[4501.76 → 4502.58] that I read this week
[4502.58 → 4503.24] put it this way,
[4503.94 → 4504.34] he said,
[4504.78 → 4505.46] God's special
[4505.46 → 4506.08] relationship
[4506.08 → 4506.82] with Israel
[4506.82 → 4507.98] is not an end
[4507.98 → 4508.86] in and of itself,
[4509.16 → 4509.98] but a means
[4509.98 → 4510.76] to an end,
[4511.08 → 4511.76] the blessing
[4511.76 → 4513.10] of nations.
[4514.18 → 4514.68] And if you want,
[4514.74 → 4515.12] you can go
[4515.12 → 4515.52] and read
[4515.52 → 4516.54] Genesis 12,
[4517.02 → 4518.18] really only the
[4518.18 → 4518.78] first three verses
[4518.78 → 4519.30] and you will see
[4519.30 → 4520.32] this point made.
[4520.32 → 4522.14] And now,
[4522.90 → 4524.40] the same continues
[4524.40 → 4525.30] to be true
[4525.30 → 4526.22] for you
[4526.22 → 4526.94] and for me.
[4528.34 → 4529.28] If we know
[4529.28 → 4530.28] God's mercy,
[4530.96 → 4531.90] we should show
[4531.90 → 4532.68] God's mercy.
[4534.18 → 4535.52] Jesus taught us
[4535.52 → 4536.16] to pray,
[4536.56 → 4536.76] saying,
[4536.92 → 4538.66] forgive our sins
[4538.66 → 4539.72] as we forgive
[4539.72 → 4540.82] those who sin
[4540.82 → 4541.50] against us.
[4541.66 → 4542.90] If you are forgiven
[4542.90 → 4543.74] by God,
[4543.98 → 4544.86] it's so that you
[4544.86 → 4545.44] will forgive
[4545.44 → 4546.60] others around you.
[4546.60 → 4548.62] over and over
[4548.62 → 4549.54] and over again,
[4549.66 → 4550.38] you can see
[4550.38 → 4551.18] in the Bible
[4551.18 → 4551.88] that this point
[4551.88 → 4552.70] is being made,
[4552.76 → 4553.70] that if you know
[4553.70 → 4554.78] God's love,
[4554.96 → 4555.94] if you are changed
[4555.94 → 4557.04] by God's love,
[4557.18 → 4558.12] then that love
[4558.12 → 4559.54] needs to change you.
[4561.08 → 4561.84] Every night,
[4561.96 → 4563.06] I pray with my kids
[4563.06 → 4563.80] when they are in bed,
[4564.48 → 4565.18] and we pray,
[4565.60 → 4565.86] God,
[4566.02 → 4567.04] help us know
[4567.04 → 4568.80] your love more
[4568.80 → 4569.64] and help us
[4569.64 → 4570.36] to live
[4570.36 → 4571.62] that love
[4571.62 → 4572.38] tomorrow.
[4573.80 → 4574.60] When you are
[4574.60 → 4576.00] in God's love,
[4576.60 → 4577.84] you should love
[4577.84 → 4579.80] like God loves.
[4581.24 → 4581.52] And so,
[4581.58 → 4582.54] the Christian church
[4582.54 → 4583.76] should pursue
[4583.76 → 4585.40] justice for others
[4585.40 → 4587.10] even when she
[4587.10 → 4588.54] receives injustice
[4588.54 → 4589.86] from others.
[4591.06 → 4592.14] The Christian church
[4592.14 → 4592.80] doesn't need
[4592.80 → 4593.32] the mercy
[4593.32 → 4594.16] and the goodwill
[4594.16 → 4595.00] of the state
[4595.00 → 4596.24] or of the culture,
[4596.44 → 4597.60] but we should
[4597.60 → 4598.90] show mercy
[4598.90 → 4600.02] and goodwill
[4600.02 → 4600.98] to all that we meet.
[4604.12 → 4604.90] Let me give you
[4604.90 → 4605.46] an example.
[4605.46 → 4607.16] This is an old one.
[4607.26 → 4608.68] It's from the 4th century.
[4609.64 → 4610.48] In the 4th century,
[4610.58 → 4611.34] there was a plague
[4611.34 → 4612.76] that rolled through
[4612.76 → 4614.10] parts of the
[4614.10 → 4615.36] Roman Empire.
[4616.60 → 4617.54] Many of the wealthy
[4617.54 → 4619.12] and free citizens
[4619.12 → 4620.94] fled from the cities
[4620.94 → 4622.46] to their country homes,
[4622.52 → 4624.76] to the less populated areas,
[4624.90 → 4625.76] because the plague
[4625.76 → 4626.78] wasn't spreading as quickly
[4626.78 → 4627.62] in those regions,
[4627.96 → 4628.34] obviously.
[4629.48 → 4629.62] Now,
[4629.68 → 4630.42] Eusebius,
[4630.58 → 4631.62] who's a Christian
[4631.62 → 4632.62] historian
[4632.62 → 4633.60] from that time,
[4634.38 → 4636.12] he would go on
[4636.12 → 4637.36] to become a leader
[4637.36 → 4638.30] in the Christian church,
[4639.18 → 4640.70] he notes that there
[4640.70 → 4642.04] is one group of people
[4642.04 → 4643.14] that stayed behind.
[4644.60 → 4645.20] Christians.
[4646.36 → 4647.62] He even writes
[4647.62 → 4649.40] that even as Christians
[4649.40 → 4650.36] were being persecuted
[4650.36 → 4651.00] and killed
[4651.00 → 4651.70] for their beliefs,
[4651.86 → 4653.28] Christians were being told
[4653.28 → 4654.94] to offer sacrifices
[4654.94 → 4655.68] to idols
[4655.68 → 4657.46] and to offer sacrifices
[4657.46 → 4658.22] to the emperor.
[4658.22 → 4659.14] they were being told
[4659.14 → 4661.24] by way of identifying them
[4661.24 → 4662.98] to deny the name of Jesus,
[4663.16 → 4664.02] and if they didn't,
[4664.28 → 4665.20] then they would be killed.
[4665.66 → 4667.30] Even as this is happening,
[4667.66 → 4668.58] Eusebius writes,
[4668.84 → 4669.80] and you'll see this on screen,
[4670.24 → 4670.78] for they,
[4671.14 → 4671.60] Christians,
[4672.14 → 4673.30] alone in the face
[4673.30 → 4674.10] of such ills,
[4674.36 → 4675.50] showed their sympathy
[4675.50 → 4676.58] and humanity
[4676.58 → 4677.58] every day.
[4678.24 → 4679.60] They cared for
[4679.60 → 4680.80] and buried the dead,
[4681.28 → 4681.80] for there were
[4681.80 → 4682.58] countless numbers
[4682.58 → 4683.30] who had no one
[4683.30 → 4683.98] to care for them.
[4684.60 → 4685.42] Others gathered
[4685.42 → 4686.62] all the sick together
[4686.62 → 4687.60] from the whole city
[4687.60 → 4688.34] and fed them.
[4689.00 → 4689.70] And by this,
[4689.84 → 4690.70] everyone heard
[4690.70 → 4691.46] about their good
[4691.46 → 4692.64] and glorified
[4692.64 → 4693.26] the God
[4693.26 → 4694.24] of the Christians.
[4696.50 → 4697.98] A little while later,
[4698.48 → 4699.48] Emperor Julian,
[4699.78 → 4700.98] who's known to history
[4700.98 → 4703.04] as Julian the Apostate,
[4703.12 → 4703.96] he's the last
[4703.96 → 4704.98] pagan emperor
[4704.98 → 4706.26] in this time,
[4706.62 → 4707.78] he's writing a letter
[4707.78 → 4708.56] to one of the
[4708.56 → 4709.36] high priests
[4709.36 → 4710.28] of Galatia,
[4710.62 → 4711.68] a pagan priest,
[4711.78 → 4712.72] he writes in his letter,
[4713.52 → 4715.20] it is disgraceful
[4715.20 → 4716.40] that the impious
[4716.40 → 4717.26] Galileans,
[4717.42 → 4718.58] that's Julian's word
[4718.58 → 4719.16] for Christians,
[4719.68 → 4720.54] it is disgraceful
[4720.54 → 4721.48] that the impious
[4721.48 → 4723.00] Christians support
[4723.00 → 4724.38] not their own poor
[4724.38 → 4726.32] but ours as well.
[4727.72 → 4728.66] He goes on to say
[4728.66 → 4729.90] that pagan priests
[4729.90 → 4731.00] should do the same
[4731.00 → 4732.02] as these Christians.
[4733.30 → 4734.80] If the pagan religion
[4734.80 → 4735.50] ever hopes
[4735.50 → 4736.84] to win popular approval
[4736.84 → 4737.72] again and to do
[4737.72 → 4738.90] what is right and good,
[4739.80 → 4740.74] Julian says that
[4740.74 → 4742.04] I believe we really
[4742.04 → 4743.22] ought truly to practice
[4743.22 → 4744.54] every one of these virtues.
[4744.54 → 4744.68] Jews.
[4746.80 → 4747.50] So here,
[4747.62 → 4748.40] what was going on?
[4749.50 → 4751.18] While the object
[4751.18 → 4752.38] of injustice,
[4753.38 → 4755.72] they risked death
[4755.72 → 4756.98] for the justice
[4756.98 → 4758.76] and the just treatment
[4758.76 → 4759.70] of others.
[4762.28 → 4763.64] While receiving
[4763.64 → 4764.50] no mercy
[4764.50 → 4765.72] from the emperor,
[4766.56 → 4768.08] they lived mercifully
[4768.08 → 4769.78] for those around them.
[4769.78 → 4773.18] sometimes you hear
[4773.18 → 4773.76] the phrase,
[4774.68 → 4775.92] and this is becoming
[4775.92 → 4777.04] increasingly more
[4777.04 → 4777.62] resounding
[4777.62 → 4779.92] in our post-Christian
[4779.92 → 4780.74] world as Christians
[4780.74 → 4781.38] are thinking through
[4781.38 → 4782.06] how to respond.
[4782.18 → 4782.68] Sometimes you hear
[4782.68 → 4783.10] the phrase,
[4783.58 → 4784.02] as Christians,
[4784.20 → 4785.06] we are in the world
[4785.06 → 4786.52] but not of the world.
[4787.58 → 4788.54] And that's not wrong,
[4788.72 → 4789.48] strictly speaking,
[4789.60 → 4789.74] right?
[4789.78 → 4790.64] The kinds of things
[4790.64 → 4791.66] that the world celebrates,
[4791.80 → 4792.36] we reject.
[4792.74 → 4793.26] The sources
[4793.26 → 4795.04] and purposes of power
[4795.04 → 4795.86] that the world
[4795.86 → 4796.60] holds up
[4796.60 → 4797.34] are opposite
[4797.34 → 4798.82] to the service
[4798.82 → 4799.56] and sacrifice
[4799.56 → 4800.68] that those of us
[4800.68 → 4801.42] in the kingdom of Jesus
[4801.42 → 4802.42] are called to live
[4802.42 → 4803.70] out of and towards.
[4804.06 → 4804.18] Right?
[4804.24 → 4805.32] In the kingdom of God,
[4805.40 → 4805.96] to be first,
[4806.04 → 4806.84] you have to make yourself
[4806.84 → 4807.48] last.
[4809.16 → 4810.82] But it must also
[4810.82 → 4811.58] be true
[4811.58 → 4813.66] that Christians
[4813.66 → 4815.62] are in the world
[4815.62 → 4818.18] for the world.
[4818.18 → 4822.42] this is our Father's world
[4822.42 → 4823.24] and He has given us
[4823.24 → 4824.58] charge over it
[4824.58 → 4826.04] and true repentance
[4826.04 → 4828.40] based on the Word of God
[4828.40 → 4829.94] will change you
[4829.94 → 4831.94] and a changed you
[4831.94 → 4834.34] will change the world.
[4835.82 → 4836.96] A changed you
[4836.96 → 4838.34] will go out
[4838.34 → 4839.80] into those places
[4839.80 → 4840.72] of injustice
[4840.72 → 4842.16] to bring justice,
[4842.32 → 4843.20] into those places
[4843.20 → 4844.54] that are lacking mercy
[4844.54 → 4845.74] to be merciful.
[4846.06 → 4847.12] A changed you
[4847.12 → 4849.32] having seen
[4849.32 → 4850.64] Jesus Christ,
[4851.00 → 4851.94] the one who lived
[4851.94 → 4853.22] the life I should have lived
[4853.22 → 4854.20] and the one who died
[4854.20 → 4855.86] the death that I deserve,
[4855.94 → 4856.94] the one who bore
[4856.94 → 4858.02] God's justice
[4858.02 → 4858.98] for my sin
[4858.98 → 4859.94] and somehow
[4859.94 → 4860.86] in His grace
[4860.86 → 4861.86] has called me
[4861.86 → 4862.36] to Himself,
[4862.52 → 4863.66] has adopted me
[4863.66 → 4864.68] as a brother
[4864.68 → 4865.96] and has made me
[4865.96 → 4867.30] a child of God
[4867.30 → 4867.86] in a new
[4867.86 → 4869.02] and fantastic way.
[4869.38 → 4871.28] If this is true
[4871.28 → 4871.94] for you
[4871.94 → 4872.96] in repentance,
[4873.60 → 4874.70] your life
[4874.70 → 4877.36] life is changed
[4877.36 → 4878.52] forever.
[4881.52 → 4883.14] True repentance
[4883.14 → 4885.74] not only says
[4885.74 → 4886.40] I'm sorry
[4886.40 → 4888.12] but turns away
[4888.12 → 4889.98] from the injustices
[4889.98 → 4891.58] and the lack of mercy.
[4891.58 → 4896.08] and in Jonah's day
[4896.08 → 4899.18] the people of Israel
[4899.18 → 4901.30] God's chosen people
[4901.30 → 4903.66] were so hard of heart
[4903.66 → 4904.96] that they needed
[4904.96 → 4907.36] God's people's sworn enemy
[4907.36 → 4909.62] to prove that this was true.
[4913.46 → 4915.26] Don't be like the Israelites.
[4915.26 → 4919.20] Don't need
[4919.20 → 4921.58] this kind of
[4921.58 → 4922.74] sworn enemy
[4922.74 → 4924.70] to let God
[4924.70 → 4926.60] soften your heart.
[4929.10 → 4929.94] Instead,
[4931.14 → 4931.92] imagine,
[4932.34 → 4932.92] imagine
[4932.92 → 4934.06] what the world
[4934.06 → 4934.64] might say,
[4935.42 → 4936.24] what the Julian,
[4936.52 → 4937.64] the apostates
[4937.64 → 4938.80] of the world today
[4938.80 → 4939.70] might say
[4939.70 → 4940.62] if this
[4940.62 → 4941.70] is how Christians
[4941.70 → 4942.80] lived.
[4942.80 → 4945.38] that is our call
[4945.38 → 4947.02] that on the word
[4947.02 → 4947.42] of God
[4947.42 → 4947.96] we might go
[4947.96 → 4948.84] from this place
[4948.84 → 4949.76] genuinely
[4949.76 → 4951.44] repentant.
[4952.54 → 4953.14] Father,
[4953.28 → 4953.54] forgive
[4953.54 → 4955.38] as I forgive.
[4955.86 → 4956.16] Father,
[4956.24 → 4956.84] have mercy
[4956.84 → 4957.88] as I am
[4957.88 → 4958.72] merciful.
[4959.90 → 4960.22] Father,
[4960.38 → 4961.24] send us
[4961.24 → 4961.72] out
[4961.72 → 4962.82] in the power
[4962.82 → 4964.08] of your
[4964.08 → 4965.02] holy name
[4965.02 → 4966.10] with the power
[4966.10 → 4967.20] of your
[4967.20 → 4967.88] word
[4967.88 → 4968.96] in the power
[4968.96 → 4969.98] of your
[4969.98 → 4971.04] Holy Spirit
[4971.04 → 4971.92] to be
[4971.92 → 4972.62] a people
[4972.62 → 4973.52] for
[4973.52 → 4974.48] your
[4974.48 → 4975.50] world.
[4976.14 → 4976.42] Amen?
[4977.56 → 4978.50] Let's pray together.
[4982.04 → 4982.84] Holy Father,
[4982.94 → 4983.82] as we have said,
[4983.94 → 4984.94] so we pray.
[4985.92 → 4986.56] Send us out
[4986.56 → 4987.52] now in the power
[4987.52 → 4989.28] of your name.
[4989.42 → 4989.96] Send us out
[4989.96 → 4990.58] with the power
[4990.58 → 4991.68] of your gospel message.
[4991.84 → 4992.30] Send us out
[4992.30 → 4992.86] in the power
[4992.86 → 4993.84] of your Holy Spirit
[4993.84 → 4994.98] to proclaim
[4994.98 → 4996.10] true
[4996.10 → 4996.98] repentance.
[4998.90 → 4999.40] Change
[4999.40 → 4999.84] our
[4999.84 → 5000.66] lives.
[5000.66 → 5002.28] help us
[5002.28 → 5002.68] to know,
[5002.86 → 5003.14] Lord God,
[5003.18 → 5003.78] that all
[5003.78 → 5005.00] we have
[5005.00 → 5005.92] is
[5005.92 → 5006.54] you.
[5007.66 → 5008.40] But more
[5008.40 → 5008.90] importantly,
[5009.04 → 5009.62] help us to know
[5009.62 → 5010.72] that all we need
[5010.72 → 5011.88] is you.
[5013.36 → 5014.14] All we have
[5014.14 → 5014.64] is Christ
[5014.64 → 5015.68] and so we sing
[5015.68 → 5017.12] in his name
[5017.12 → 5017.76] alone.
[5017.76 → 5018.84] Amen.
[5018.84 → 5020.10] God.
[5045.10 → 5045.66] Hallelujah!
[5045.66 → 5053.74] Hallelujah, all I have is Christ.
[5056.30 → 5064.12] Hallelujah, Jesus is my life.
[5064.42 → 5074.46] I once was lost in the darkest night, yet thought I knew the way.
[5074.46 → 5083.54] The sin that promised joy in life had led me to the grave.
[5083.78 → 5092.60] I had no hope that you would own a rebel to your will.
[5092.90 → 5101.54] And if you had not loved me first, I would refuse you still.
[5104.46 → 5105.46] Amen.
[5105.46 → 5106.46] Amen.
[5106.46 → 5107.46] Amen.
[5107.46 → 5108.46] Amen.
[5108.46 → 5109.46] Amen.
[5109.46 → 5139.46] 
[5139.46 → 5140.46] Amen.
[5140.46 → 5146.42] All I have is Christ.
[5146.46 → 5155.42] Hallelujah, all I have is Christ.
[5155.46 → 5165.14] Hallelujah, Jesus is my life.
[5165.14 → 5184.02] Now I would be yours alone, and live, so all might see. The strength to follow your commands could never come from me.
[5184.02 → 5201.78] Oh Father, use my ransom life in any way you choose, and let my song forever be, my only boast is you.
[5201.78 → 5220.74] Hallelujah, all I have is Christ. Hallelujah, Jesus is my life.
[5220.74 → 5238.72] Hallelujah, all I have is Christ. Hallelujah, Jesus is my life.
[5238.72 → 5260.06] Hallelujah, all I have is Christ. Hallelujah, Jesus is my life.
[5260.06 → 5261.06] Amen.
[5290.06 → 5296.64] I believe following the blessing, they will also be up here to receive you in this space.
[5297.24 → 5302.94] As you go, know that God goes with you, and so receive his blessing.
[5304.72 → 5312.56] God, go before you to lead you. God, go behind you to protect you. God, go beneath you to support you.
[5312.96 → 5317.82] God, go beside you to befriend you. Do not be afraid.
[5317.82 → 5326.68] Let the blessing of God come upon you today. Do not be afraid, but go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
[5327.80 → 5328.20] Amen.
[5347.82 → 5365.58] These are the days of your servant Moses' righteousness being restored.
[5365.58 → 5375.56] And those are the days of great trials, of famine and darkness and storm.
[5375.56 → 5383.38] Still hear the voice of the desert crying, prepare ye the way of the Lord.
[5383.70 → 5392.38] Behold, be come, riding on the clouds, shining like the sun, at the trumpet door.
[5393.04 → 5397.10] Lift your voice, it's here to believe.
