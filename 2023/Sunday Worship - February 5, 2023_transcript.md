[0.00 --> 17.62]  What the future holds, still I know I can trust your faithfulness.
[17.62 --> 39.62]  Certain as the rivers reach the sea, certain as the sun rises in the east, I can rest in your faithfulness.
[39.62 --> 63.54]  Sure than a mother's tender love, sure than the stars still shine above, I can rest in your faithfulness.
[63.54 --> 75.86]  I don't know how or when I'll die.
[75.86 --> 81.86]  Will it be a leap?
[83.86 --> 90.86]  Will I have a chance to say goodbye?
[90.86 --> 102.86]  No, I don't know how much time is left for me.
[102.86 --> 114.86]  But in the end, I will know your faithfulness.
[114.86 --> 138.34]  When darkness overwhelms my soul, when thoughts are storms of doubt, still I trust you are always faithful.
[138.34 --> 146.34]  Always faithful.
[146.34 --> 169.34]  Certain as the rivers reach the sea, certain as the sun rises in the east, I can rest in your faithfulness.
[169.34 --> 185.34]  Sure than a mother's tender love, sure than the stars still shine above, I can rest.
[185.34 --> 195.34]  In your faithfulness, we can rest.
[195.34 --> 197.34]  In your faithfulness, we can rest.
[197.34 --> 202.34]  In your faithfulness, we can rest.
[202.34 --> 208.34]  True service, we can rest.
[212.34 --> 213.34]  Thing and human sound.
[213.34 --> 214.34]  The음 worm
[214.34 --> 218.34]  Oh, I've heard a thousand stories
[218.34 --> 230.90]  stories of what they think you're like but i've heard the tender whisper of love
[231.86 --> 242.10]  the dead of night and you tell me that you're pleased and that i'm never alone

[654.76 --> 656.76]  Thank you.
[656.76 --> 658.76]  Thank you.
[658.76 --> 659.76]  Thank you.
[659.76 --> 665.36]  also walk your own route if that doesn't work for you. If you'd like to join the team, you can
[665.36 --> 671.20]  look in the midweek memo or the bulletin. The easiest way, because it's all online, is to do
[671.20 --> 675.86]  that because then you can just click the links that are provided and it will take you to our team
[675.86 --> 682.30]  page where you can join the team and create your own like profile, I guess, in there and then you
[682.30 --> 689.68]  can share that link to raise money for your team as part of the bigger Emanuel team. And then you
[689.68 --> 695.14]  can also use the link in the bulletin if you are not interested or able to participate in the walk
[695.14 --> 701.06]  but you'd like to support Emanuel's team. The link to donate is also in the bulletin. And if anyone
[701.06 --> 707.38]  has questions about it, you can grab me after church or ask one of my kids. They also know a lot about it.
[707.38 --> 717.78]  Thanks. Good morning, everyone. My name is Kevin. I'm the youth pastor here. Ten years ago, a group of
[717.78 --> 724.66]  seven of us youth pastors got together and after much conversation and then work, we put on a youth
[724.66 --> 730.40]  conference for, it's a reformed youth conference for youth across really BC but into Alberta and
[730.40 --> 735.12]  Washington as well called Reactivate. I'm sure you've heard of it. I'm sure you've seen videos
[735.12 --> 740.16]  of it if you've been here a long time. That was hosted by Gateway CRC for a number of years until
[740.16 --> 746.54]  their youth pastor resigned. And the group of seven dwindled to a group of four. That group of four then
[746.54 --> 751.82]  decided to move the conference to Willoughby CRC where it's been for the last number of years.
[751.82 --> 756.62]  Since then, the youth pastor at Willoughby has resigned but he's remained on this Reactivate
[756.62 --> 762.22]  leadership team. Why am I telling you all of this? Well, because this year Reactivate, the reformed
[762.22 --> 768.54]  youth conference, is going to be coming here. So Emanuel is going to be hosting this youth conference
[768.54 --> 775.66]  come September. You'll hear a little bit of accounts from council later. We have worked, I have talked to
[775.66 --> 780.46]  the school next door. We're going to be using their gym a little bit. But come September, there is going
[780.46 --> 786.54]  to be 200 plus youth from across BC coming down into our church which I am pretty darn excited about
[786.54 --> 790.62]  to be honest with you. I think it's going to be a wonderful weekend. It'll be the weekend after Labor Day.
[790.62 --> 796.06]  You will be hearing an obnoxious amount of this as the months and the weeks roll on. So just I'm
[796.06 --> 801.02]  preparing your hearts for those. I'm also preparing your hearts and brains a little bit because as we
[801.02 --> 805.58]  get closer to that date, I'm going to be asking for some volunteers to help with that weekend. So
[806.06 --> 811.26]  just be ready because in September there's going to be a very fun conference happening here with the
[811.26 --> 816.62]  youth from across BC. A second announcement, youth, there's youth coffee after church today too. So come
[816.62 --> 819.18]  hang out at the Alchemist house. It's going to be fun. We'll see you there.
[824.14 --> 831.58]  And lastly, good morning from me. My name is Chris. I'm one of the pastors here and it's my privilege to
[831.58 --> 837.58]  lead us in our worship together this morning. I'm going to ask as you're able, would you stand?
[838.14 --> 845.02]  We can be called into God's presence, gathered up in his name and receive his greeting.
[845.02 --> 855.34]  Receive the greeting of our God. Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord
[855.34 --> 861.82]  Jesus Christ, his Son, and our Savior through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit. All God's
[861.82 --> 867.58]  people said, amen. I'm going to invite you to turn to those around you and greet them in the name of
[867.58 --> 872.54]  Jesus. A handshake or a fist bump or a hug or a head nod if you're not into touching this morning.
[872.54 --> 879.74]  Greetings.
[879.74 --> 880.94]  You start.
[888.94 --> 891.02]  I didn't wash my hands after touching his hand.
[891.02 --> 906.94]  I didn't wash my hands after touching his hand. I didn't wash my hands after touching his hand.
[906.94 --> 911.58]  Our call to worship this morning comes from Psalm 5 verses 11 and 12.
[911.58 --> 921.10]  But let all who take refuge in you be glad. Let them ever sing for joy. Spread your protection over
[921.10 --> 928.54]  them that those who love your name may rejoice in you. For surely, O Lord, you bless the righteous.
[929.26 --> 932.54]  You surround them with your favor as with a shield.
[932.54 --> 958.54]  Let us come before the Father
[958.54 --> 960.14]  Father
[960.14 --> 961.18]  Father
[961.18 --> 964.46]  with our hearts open wide
[964.46 --> 969.26]  Let us come in true submission
[969.26 --> 974.94]  In the faith he will provide
[974.94 --> 980.14]  Let us come toward the Savior
[980.14 --> 986.06]  He has his arms stretched open wide
[986.06 --> 989.98]  He died at Calvary
[989.98 --> 991.98]  Just to save you
[991.98 --> 996.78]  Because he loves you as his child
[996.78 --> 1003.98]  He is the everlasting Lord
[1003.98 --> 1009.42]  He is the truth, the great I am
[1009.42 --> 1013.98]  The Lord Jehovah, creator of the earth
[1013.98 --> 1017.90]  Come let us bow before him
[1017.90 --> 1026.06]  Come with boldness to your Father
[1026.06 --> 1031.90]  He has called you as his child
[1031.90 --> 1035.90]  Join us with Christ
[1035.90 --> 1039.02]  O righteous saints
[1039.02 --> 1042.94]  He has made you holy in his sight
[1042.94 --> 1049.02]  He is the everlasting Lord
[1049.02 --> 1054.94]  He is the truth, the great I am
[1054.94 --> 1058.94]  The Lord Jehovah, creator of the earth
[1058.94 --> 1062.94]  Come let us bow before him now
[1062.94 --> 1066.86]  Come let us bow before him now
[1066.86 --> 1068.86]  He is the everlasting Lord
[1068.86 --> 1070.86]  He is the everlasting Lord
[1070.86 --> 1072.86]  He is the everlasting Lord
[1072.86 --> 1074.86]  He is the truth, the great I am
[1074.86 --> 1076.86]  The Lord Jehovah, creator of the earth
[1076.86 --> 1081.74]  The Lord Jehovah, creator of the earth
[1081.74 --> 1086.78]  Come let us bow before him now
[1086.78 --> 1092.78]  Come let us bow before him now
[1092.78 --> 1098.70]  Come let us bow before him now
[1098.70 --> 1102.62]  See him now
[1102.62 --> 1116.54]  See him there
[1116.54 --> 1130.46]  The great I am
[1130.46 --> 1132.46]  The great I am
[1132.46 --> 1137.58]  A crown of thorns
[1137.58 --> 1140.46]  Upon his head
[1140.46 --> 1144.38]  The Father's heart
[1144.38 --> 1148.38]  Displayed for us
[1148.38 --> 1150.38]  Oh God
[1150.38 --> 1151.38]  Oh God
[1151.38 --> 1156.38]  We thank you for the cross
[1156.38 --> 1162.38]  Lifted up
[1162.38 --> 1166.38]  On Calvary's hill
[1166.38 --> 1170.30]  We cursed your name
[1170.30 --> 1172.30]  And even still
[1172.30 --> 1176.30]  You bore our shame
[1176.30 --> 1180.30]  And paid the cost
[1180.30 --> 1182.30]  Oh God
[1182.30 --> 1188.30]  We thank you for the cross
[1188.30 --> 1196.22]  Behold the Lamb
[1196.22 --> 1199.90]  The story of redemption
[1199.90 --> 1204.28]  Written on his hands
[1204.28 --> 1209.28]  Jesus, you will reign forevermore
[1209.28 --> 1213.22]  The victory is yours
[1213.22 --> 1217.14]  Offer up
[1217.14 --> 1219.14]  This sacrifice
[1219.14 --> 1221.14]  We sing your praise
[1221.14 --> 1223.14]  Endless hallelujahs
[1223.14 --> 1225.14]  To your holy name
[1225.14 --> 1229.14]  Jesus, you will reign forevermore
[1229.14 --> 1235.14]  The victory is yours
[1235.14 --> 1241.14]  Offer up
[1241.14 --> 1245.06]  This sacrifice
[1245.06 --> 1249.06]  For every sin
[1249.06 --> 1252.06]  Our Savior died
[1252.06 --> 1256.06]  The Lord of life
[1256.06 --> 1259.06]  Can't be contained
[1259.06 --> 1262.06]  Our God
[1262.06 --> 1266.06]  Has risen from the grave
[1266.06 --> 1268.98]  O our God
[1268.98 --> 1269.78]  O our God
[1269.78 --> 1272.98]  Has risen from the grave
[1272.98 --> 1277.94]  Behold the Lamb
[1277.94 --> 1280.92]  The story of redemption
[1280.92 --> 1285.14]  Written on his hands
[1285.14 --> 1289.90]  Jesus, you will reign forevermore
[1289.90 --> 1293.98]  The victory is yours
[1293.98 --> 1298.90]  We sing your praise
[1298.90 --> 1301.90]  Endless hallelujahs
[1301.90 --> 1304.90]  To your holy name
[1304.90 --> 1308.90]  Jesus, you will reign forevermore
[1308.90 --> 1314.90]  The victory is yours
[1314.90 --> 1319.82]  When the age
[1319.82 --> 1321.88]  When the age
[1321.88 --> 1322.82]  Of death
[1322.82 --> 1323.36]  Of death
[1323.36 --> 1324.82]  Is dawn
[1324.82 --> 1327.82]  We'll see your face
[1327.82 --> 1331.82]  Bright as the sun
[1331.82 --> 1334.82]  We'll bow before
[1334.82 --> 1339.82]  The King of kings
[1339.82 --> 1342.74]  O God
[1342.74 --> 1343.74]  O God
[1343.74 --> 1344.74]  Forever
[1344.74 --> 1345.74]  We will sing
[1345.74 --> 1346.74]  O God
[1346.74 --> 1347.74]  Forever
[1347.74 --> 1348.74]  We will sing
[1348.74 --> 1354.74]  Behold the Lamb
[1354.74 --> 1357.66]  The story of redemption
[1357.66 --> 1358.46]  The story of redemption
[1358.46 --> 1362.72]  Written on his hands
[1362.72 --> 1367.72]  Jesus, you will reign forevermore
[1367.72 --> 1371.66]  The victory is yours
[1371.66 --> 1376.58]  You will reign forevermore
[1376.58 --> 1381.50]  The victory is yours
[1381.50 --> 1391.38]  The victory is yours
[1391.38 --> 1394.42]  You will reign forevermore
[1394.42 --> 1398.22]  The victory is yours
[1398.22 --> 1400.44]  You reign forevermore
[1400.44 --> 1403.22]  The victory is yours
[1403.22 --> 1406.00]  Glory is yours.
[1413.22 --> 1415.58]  Because Jesus has given us the victory,
[1416.00 --> 1419.42]  we know that we can come to him in a time of confession
[1419.42 --> 1424.98]  and lay our hearts and our weaknesses and our sins before him.
[1425.94 --> 1428.18]  Let's take a few minutes in silent prayer.
[1433.22 --> 1435.22]  Amen.
[1456.58 --> 1459.82]  Our assurance comes from Isaiah 57.
[1459.82 --> 1464.94]  For this is what the high and exalted one says,
[1465.66 --> 1468.70]  he who lives forever, whose name is holy.
[1469.50 --> 1472.24]  I live in a high and holy place,
[1472.50 --> 1476.56]  but also with the one who is contrite and lowly in spirit,
[1477.20 --> 1479.34]  to revive the spirit of the lowly
[1479.34 --> 1482.30]  and to revive the heart of the contrite.
[1482.30 --> 1487.94]  I will not accuse them forever, nor will I always be angry,
[1488.52 --> 1491.46]  for then they would faint away because of me,
[1492.02 --> 1493.88]  the very people I have created.
[1494.78 --> 1498.24]  I was enraged by their sinful greed.
[1498.86 --> 1501.98]  I punished them and hid my face in anger.
[1502.68 --> 1505.60]  Yet they kept on in their willful ways.
[1505.60 --> 1509.84]  I have seen their ways, but I will heal them.
[1510.56 --> 1514.42]  I will guide them and restore comfort to Israel's mourners,

[1889.58 --> 1893.16]  His promises shall last.
[1893.62 --> 1901.66]  Bought by Him at such a cost, He will hold me fast.

[2459.96 --> 2460.78]  A vegan
[2460.78 --> 2461.82]  Really
[2461.82 --> 2463.00]  That's surprising
[2463.00 --> 2463.64]  Yeah

[2492.92 --> 2494.42]  He disappears sometimes
[2494.42 --> 2495.68]  So we don't always see him
[2495.68 --> 2496.86]  But he's there
[2496.86 --> 2497.98]  Well that seems like

[2506.50 --> 2508.00]  As God's family
[2508.00 --> 2509.28]  And Jesus did that too
[2509.28 --> 2511.48]  Jesus had a bunch of people
[2511.48 --> 2512.22]  That followed him
[2512.22 --> 2512.96]  Called the disciples
[2512.96 --> 2513.86]  And he taught them
[2513.86 --> 2514.78]  And they learned together
[2514.78 --> 2515.22]  As a group
[2515.22 --> 2516.50]  So we're going to talk about that
[2516.50 --> 2517.08]  In the back
[2517.08 --> 2517.92]  Is that a good idea
[2517.92 --> 2518.96]  Should we do that

[2535.54 --> 2536.12]  Come to church
[2536.12 --> 2537.00]  That we could go to
[2537.00 --> 2537.90]  Children's worship time
[2537.90 --> 2538.48]  And that the grown ups
[2538.48 --> 2539.28]  Could stay back here
[2539.28 --> 2540.30]  Be with us now
[2540.30 --> 2541.54]  As we learn more about you
[2541.54 --> 2542.48]  And what it means
[2542.48 --> 2543.86]  To be a part of your family
[2543.86 --> 2545.30]  We pray this in your name
[2545.30 --> 2546.54]  Amen
[2546.54 --> 2547.34]  All right
[2547.34 --> 2548.14]  Let's stand up
[2548.14 --> 2551.32]  And do the kids blessing
[2551.32 --> 2554.30]  And let's say
[2554.30 --> 2555.44]  The Lord be with you together
[2555.44 --> 2555.94]  Are you ready?
[2555.94 --> 2558.54]  The Lord be with you
[2558.54 --> 2560.34]  And I'll hold you
[2560.34 --> 2581.02]  Good morning everyone
[2581.02 --> 2584.22]  My name's Eric
[2584.22 --> 2585.58]  I'm one of the elders here as well
[2585.58 --> 2586.80]  We had a council meeting
[2586.80 --> 2587.78]  About a week and a half ago
[2587.78 --> 2590.48]  So I was just going to give a little update
[2590.48 --> 2590.94]  This morning
[2590.94 --> 2593.28]  What was on a bit of the agenda there
[2593.28 --> 2595.20]  A week and a half ago
[2595.20 --> 2597.62]  First thing we did
[2597.62 --> 2598.94]  We did a lot of work
[2598.94 --> 2600.20]  On reviewing job descriptions
[2600.20 --> 2601.46]  For all our part time staff
[2601.46 --> 2602.82]  So we worked on that
[2602.82 --> 2604.90]  And got that all tidied up
[2604.90 --> 2606.50]  For the future
[2606.50 --> 2608.16]  We're grateful for all the work
[2608.16 --> 2610.00]  All our part time staff do here
[2610.00 --> 2610.74]  From in the office
[2610.74 --> 2611.90]  And the cleaning staff
[2611.90 --> 2612.86]  And all that kind of stuff
[2612.86 --> 2614.72]  So we did that
[2614.72 --> 2617.32]  There's a
[2617.32 --> 2617.90]  We're hiring
[2617.90 --> 2618.54]  We're looking for
[2618.54 --> 2620.32]  A communications administrator
[2620.32 --> 2621.60]  So I'm sure that's been
[2621.60 --> 2622.42]  Mentioned here
[2622.42 --> 2623.56]  From the pulpit for a while
[2623.56 --> 2625.28]  So if we have one more week
[2625.28 --> 2627.48]  To accept applications for that
[2627.48 --> 2628.38]  So if you're interested
[2628.38 --> 2629.02]  In that position
[2629.02 --> 2630.76]  Please take care of that
[2630.76 --> 2631.20]  This week
[2631.20 --> 2633.46]  We have a report
[2633.46 --> 2634.22]  From the elders
[2634.22 --> 2635.78]  On special services
[2635.78 --> 2637.34]  We talked a bit about that
[2637.34 --> 2638.10]  At the council meeting
[2638.10 --> 2639.10]  But we actually have a video
[2639.10 --> 2640.24]  About it this morning
[2640.24 --> 2641.44]  That we'd like to share with you
[2641.44 --> 2651.94]  The worship ministries team
[2651.94 --> 2652.62]  About a year ago
[2652.62 --> 2654.14]  The worship ministries team
[2654.14 --> 2654.96]  Asked the elders
[2654.96 --> 2655.74]  To think about
[2655.74 --> 2657.34]  Which special worship services
[2657.34 --> 2658.00]  We will call them together for
[2658.00 --> 2658.84]  In response to that
[2658.84 --> 2659.46]  As elders
[2659.46 --> 2660.70]  In response to that
[2660.70 --> 2661.28]  As elders
[2661.28 --> 2663.20]  We have spent the last year or so
[2663.20 --> 2664.00]  Thinking about
[2664.00 --> 2664.82]  Worship or worship
[2664.82 --> 2665.70]  And the importance of
[2665.70 --> 2667.14]  Gathering or worship together
[2667.14 --> 2668.12]  As a church family
[2668.12 --> 2669.72]  As Luke writes
[2669.72 --> 2670.76]  The book of Acts
[2670.76 --> 2671.94]  From the beginning
[2671.94 --> 2674.16]  Until today
[2674.16 --> 2675.64]  The church has always gathered
[2675.64 --> 2676.88]  Devoting themselves
[2676.88 --> 2678.12]  To the apostles teaching
[2678.12 --> 2679.26]  To the fellowship
[2679.26 --> 2680.76]  To the breaking of bread
[2680.76 --> 2681.26]  And prayer
[2681.26 --> 2682.10]  The church has always held
[2682.10 --> 2684.28]  The church has always held
[2684.28 --> 2685.44]  The importance of gathering
[2685.44 --> 2686.00]  For worship
[2686.00 --> 2686.94]  In the life of the church
[2686.94 --> 2688.98]  In the life of the church
[2688.98 --> 2689.60]  Many of those special services
[2689.60 --> 2692.76]  Do not fall on Sundays
[2692.76 --> 2693.68]  Christmas
[2693.68 --> 2694.90]  Special services include
[2694.90 --> 2695.40]  New Year's
[2695.40 --> 2695.70]  Christmas
[2695.70 --> 2696.72]  New Year's Day
[2696.72 --> 2697.64]  Ash Wednesday
[2697.64 --> 2698.56]  New Year's Day
[2698.56 --> 2699.64]  Ash Wednesday
[2699.64 --> 2700.88]  Good Friday
[2700.88 --> 2701.50]  Ash Wednesday
[2701.50 --> 2701.76]  Good Friday
[2701.76 --> 2702.26]  And Thanksgiving Day
[2702.26 --> 2703.64]  It is these specific services
[2703.64 --> 2706.88]  That the elders have spent the last year
[2706.88 --> 2707.58]  Looking at reform
[2707.58 --> 2708.64]  History and tradition
[2708.64 --> 2709.44]  Looking at reform
[2709.44 --> 2710.50]  History and tradition
[2710.50 --> 2712.04]  As well as the church order
[2712.04 --> 2713.22]  Of Christian reform church
[2713.22 --> 2714.86]  We have used two principles
[2714.86 --> 2715.78]  To guide our discussion
[2715.78 --> 2717.02]  And our conclusions
[2717.02 --> 2718.06]  To how we will observe
[2718.06 --> 2719.14]  These two principles are
[2719.14 --> 2719.94]  Following the
[2719.94 --> 2721.02]  Those two principles are
[2721.02 --> 2721.78]  Following the
[2721.78 --> 2722.32]  Looting ourselves
[2722.32 --> 2722.70]  In the calendar
[2722.70 --> 2723.36]  Of scripture
[2723.36 --> 2724.22]  And rooting ourselves
[2724.22 --> 2725.10]  In the drama of scripture
[2725.10 --> 2725.96]  And gather as many of our church families
[2725.96 --> 2726.24]  Possible
[2726.24 --> 2727.82]  To gather as many of our church families
[2727.82 --> 2730.16]  One of the unique aspects of Christianity
[2730.16 --> 2732.06]  One of the unique aspects of Christianity
[2732.06 --> 2732.74]  Is our
[2732.74 --> 2734.32]  The incarnation actually happened
[2734.32 --> 2736.12]  The incarnation actually happened
[2736.12 --> 2737.82]  Jesus actually lived
[2737.82 --> 2738.86]  And walked on the earth
[2738.86 --> 2738.94]  He died on a Roman cross
[2738.94 --> 2740.78]  He died on a Roman cross
[2740.78 --> 2741.16]  The tomb is actually empty
[2741.16 --> 2743.56]  And Jesus has ascended to the right hand
[2743.56 --> 2744.40]  And God's Father
[2744.40 --> 2746.58]  Our worship together
[2746.58 --> 2747.74]  Invites us to live
[2747.74 --> 2748.42]  Our worship together
[2748.42 --> 2749.68]  Invites us to live
[2749.68 --> 2750.74]  Into the redemption
[2750.74 --> 2751.48]  Christmas
[2751.48 --> 2752.24]  Ash Wednesday
[2752.24 --> 2753.10]  Christmas
[2753.10 --> 2754.58]  And Ascension Day
[2754.58 --> 2755.20]  Good Friday
[2755.20 --> 2756.34]  And Ascension Day
[2756.34 --> 2758.16]  Will continue to be days
[2758.16 --> 2759.86]  Where our church is called to gather
[2759.86 --> 2760.58]  As a family
[2760.58 --> 2761.44]  New years is a season
[2761.44 --> 2762.38]  Where we look back
[2762.38 --> 2763.58]  On what God has done
[2763.58 --> 2764.38]  Where we look back
[2764.38 --> 2765.48]  On what God has done
[2765.48 --> 2766.14]  In the past year
[2766.14 --> 2767.72]  And where we anticipate
[2767.72 --> 2768.56]  With excitement
[2768.56 --> 2769.78]  What God might do
[2769.78 --> 2770.22]  Likewise
[2770.22 --> 2771.72]  Thanksgiving is a season
[2771.72 --> 2772.06]  Likewise
[2772.06 --> 2773.60]  Thanksgiving is a season
[2773.60 --> 2774.34]  Where we are great
[2774.34 --> 2774.88]  Giving to God
[2774.88 --> 2775.82]  For all the blessings
[2775.82 --> 2776.54]  He has given us
[2776.54 --> 2777.00]  We believe
[2777.00 --> 2777.90]  That the best way
[2777.90 --> 2778.34]  To gather
[2778.34 --> 2779.26]  As many of us
[2779.26 --> 2779.80]  As possible
[2779.80 --> 2780.42]  To celebrate
[2780.42 --> 2781.00]  New years
[2781.00 --> 2782.20]  Is to do so
[2782.20 --> 2783.28]  On the first Sunday
[2783.28 --> 2784.16]  Is to do so
[2784.16 --> 2785.02]  On the first Sunday
[2785.02 --> 2785.48]  And the best way
[2785.48 --> 2786.52]  To celebrate Thanksgiving
[2786.52 --> 2787.38]  And the best way
[2787.38 --> 2788.34]  To celebrate Thanksgiving
[2788.34 --> 2789.54]  Is to do so
[2789.54 --> 2790.20]  On the Sunday
[2790.20 --> 2791.52]  Preceding Thanksgiving
[2791.52 --> 2791.84]  Monday
[2791.84 --> 2791.90]  In this way
[2791.90 --> 2792.86]  We continue to observe
[2792.86 --> 2793.64]  Those occasions
[2793.64 --> 2794.76]  And do so
[2794.76 --> 2795.40]  In those occasions
[2795.40 --> 2797.00]  We do so in a way
[2797.00 --> 2798.48]  More meaningfully connected
[2798.48 --> 2799.00]  To the worship
[2799.00 --> 2800.42]  By making these small changes
[2800.42 --> 2801.22]  We believe
[2801.22 --> 2802.68]  To live into the redemption
[2802.68 --> 2803.54]  We are
[2803.54 --> 2804.48]  To live into the redemption
[2804.48 --> 2805.60]  More comprehensively
[2805.60 --> 2808.80]  Gather the family of believers

[2828.06 --> 2836.14]  Okay thank you elders

[2837.60 --> 2840.42]  Explaining the changes
[2840.42 --> 2840.96]  We are making
[2840.96 --> 2842.98]  With our services
[2842.98 --> 2846.08]  Kevin already alerted
[2846.08 --> 2846.54]  To the fact
[2846.54 --> 2847.34]  That we
[2847.34 --> 2849.00]  That Emmanuel
[2849.00 --> 2849.74]  Is going to take on
[2849.74 --> 2850.66]  The reactivate
[2850.66 --> 2851.60]  Conference

[2852.32 --> 2853.32]  As well
[2853.32 --> 2854.20]  Has supported
[2854.20 --> 2855.06]  On your behalf
[2855.06 --> 2856.20]  That Emmanuel
[2856.20 --> 2856.98]  Take that on
[2856.98 --> 2858.24]  And it was important
[2858.24 --> 2859.42]  For all council members
[2859.42 --> 2860.86]  That this conference
[2860.86 --> 2862.98]  Continue to keep going
[2862.98 --> 2863.82]  Despite changes
[2863.82 --> 2866.86]  And youth pastors
[2866.86 --> 2867.74]  In other churches
[2867.74 --> 2869.34]  Not being around
[2869.34 --> 2870.00]  Or resigning
[2870.00 --> 2870.72]  And such
[2870.72 --> 2872.34]  So that conference
[2872.34 --> 2873.32]  Continues to happen

[2889.10 --> 2890.08]  Or speak to Dolores
[2890.08 --> 2892.68]  I got one more thing

[2896.12 --> 2897.24]  Parable in the Bible
[2897.24 --> 2898.70]  About the sheep
[2898.70 --> 2899.86]  And the hundred sheep
[2899.86 --> 2900.86]  And the one lost sheep
[2900.86 --> 2901.60]  So as I was
[2901.60 --> 2902.92]  On my Instagram
[2902.92 --> 2904.16]  A couple weeks ago

[2905.00 --> 2905.74]  This cool video
[2905.74 --> 2906.86]  Do you ever wonder
[2906.86 --> 2908.40]  What that one lost sheep
[2908.40 --> 2909.18]  Is like ever
[2909.18 --> 2910.28]  At the one that got away
[2910.28 --> 2911.52]  That Jesus says
[2911.52 --> 2912.48]  That he went after
[2912.48 --> 2913.16]  And brought back
[2913.16 --> 2913.70]  To the fold
[2913.70 --> 2914.60]  Well I'm going to
[2914.60 --> 2915.44]  Show you a cool video
[2915.44 --> 2916.04]  That I found

[2939.44 --> 2940.88]  My name is Ken
[2940.88 --> 2941.72]  I'm an elder here
[2941.72 --> 2942.66]  At Emmanuel Church
[2942.66 --> 2943.74]  And this morning
[2943.74 --> 2945.12]  I have the privilege
[2945.12 --> 2946.76]  Of leading our brothers
[2946.76 --> 2947.52]  And sisters together
[2947.52 --> 2948.92]  In our church family prayer
[2948.92 --> 2950.06]  Before we go into prayer
[2950.06 --> 2951.08]  I just want to make
[2951.08 --> 2951.74]  One more announcement
[2951.74 --> 2953.02]  That next week
[2953.02 --> 2954.00]  We will be having
[2954.00 --> 2955.74]  The communion together
[2955.74 --> 2956.42]  And we'll be having
[2956.42 --> 2957.08]  The Lord's Supper
[2957.08 --> 2958.54]  So take time this week
[2958.54 --> 2959.88]  To think about that
[2959.88 --> 2960.56]  Talk about that
[2960.56 --> 2961.32]  Amongst your families
[2961.32 --> 2963.36]  And to reflect on
[2963.36 --> 2963.86]  What it means
[2963.86 --> 2964.66]  To come to the table
[2964.66 --> 2965.74]  And to prepare your hearts
[2965.74 --> 2967.44]  So now let's go together
[2967.44 --> 2968.88]  In our family prayer
[2968.88 --> 2971.54]  Lord God
[2971.54 --> 2972.78]  Our Father in Heaven
[2972.78 --> 2974.04]  How majestic
[2974.04 --> 2975.06]  Is your name
[2975.06 --> 2975.96]  Above the earth
[2975.96 --> 2977.16]  The heavens
[2977.16 --> 2978.26]  Declare your glory
[2978.26 --> 2979.14]  The skies
[2979.14 --> 2980.26]  Proclaim the works
[2980.26 --> 2980.88]  Of your hands
[2980.88 --> 2982.56]  Day after day
[2982.56 --> 2983.86]  They pour out speech
[2983.86 --> 2984.98]  Night after night
[2984.98 --> 2986.24]  They reveal knowledge
[2986.24 --> 2987.76]  And while the skies
[2987.76 --> 2988.30]  And the heavens
[2988.30 --> 2989.66]  Don't use audible sounds
[2989.66 --> 2990.52]  Their voices
[2990.52 --> 2991.50]  Still go out
[2991.50 --> 2992.68]  Into all the earth
[2992.68 --> 2993.74]  And their words
[2993.74 --> 2994.42]  To the ends
[2994.42 --> 2995.00]  Of the world
[2995.00 --> 2996.90]  Lord we see
[2996.90 --> 2997.52]  And experience
[2997.52 --> 2998.64]  And know your glory
[2998.64 --> 2999.76]  So we're gathered
[2999.76 --> 3000.76]  Here together today
[3000.76 --> 3001.40]  As your people
[3001.40 --> 3002.82]  At Emmanuel Church
[3002.82 --> 3003.56]  To sing praise
[3003.56 --> 3004.12]  To your name
[3004.12 --> 3005.18]  And to unite our hearts
[3005.18 --> 3006.02]  Together in worship
[3006.02 --> 3007.22]  To hear your word
[3007.22 --> 3007.84]  And to pray
[3007.84 --> 3009.64]  And we thank you
[3009.64 --> 3009.92]  Lord
[3009.92 --> 3011.14]  For all the ministries
[3011.14 --> 3011.76]  That Emmanuel
[3011.76 --> 3012.54]  Has been blessed
[3012.54 --> 3013.36]  With the opportunities
[3013.36 --> 3014.40]  To participate in
[3014.40 --> 3015.90]  We ask Lord
[3015.90 --> 3016.68]  That you give our church
[3016.68 --> 3017.74]  What we stand in need of
[3017.74 --> 3019.24]  To minister effectively
[3019.24 --> 3020.12]  To each other
[3020.12 --> 3021.20]  And to the world
[3021.20 --> 3021.86]  Around us
[3021.86 --> 3023.46]  We know that you gave
[3023.46 --> 3024.08]  The apostles
[3024.08 --> 3025.12]  The prophets
[3025.12 --> 3026.06]  The evangelists
[3026.06 --> 3026.80]  The pastors
[3026.80 --> 3027.54]  And the teachers
[3027.54 --> 3029.00]  To equip your people
[3029.00 --> 3030.30]  For works of service
[3030.30 --> 3031.86]  So that the body of Christ
[3031.86 --> 3032.76]  May be built up
[3032.76 --> 3034.12]  Lord we ask
[3034.12 --> 3035.06]  That you build us up
[3035.06 --> 3035.86]  As your church
[3035.86 --> 3037.18]  To the whole measure
[3037.18 --> 3038.22]  And fullness of Christ
[3038.22 --> 3040.64]  And as a church
[3040.64 --> 3042.04]  And extended communities
[3042.04 --> 3043.16]  Lord our lives
[3043.16 --> 3043.86]  Have been touched
[3043.86 --> 3044.90]  By the loss
[3044.90 --> 3045.62]  Of loved ones
[3045.62 --> 3046.40]  Again this week
[3046.40 --> 3047.92]  Lord we pray
[3047.92 --> 3048.74]  For the family
[3048.74 --> 3049.32]  And friends
[3049.32 --> 3050.08]  Of young Matthew
[3050.08 --> 3051.10]  Who passed away
[3051.10 --> 3052.14]  Suddenly a week ago
[3052.14 --> 3053.70]  As his family
[3053.70 --> 3054.22]  And friends
[3054.22 --> 3054.66]  Are mourning
[3054.66 --> 3055.50]  This heavy loss
[3055.50 --> 3056.54]  Lord we ask
[3056.54 --> 3057.38]  That you bless them
[3057.38 --> 3058.12]  With comfort
[3058.12 --> 3059.04]  That only you
[3059.04 --> 3059.64]  Can provide
[3059.64 --> 3061.84]  We also lift up
[3061.84 --> 3062.70]  Others in our midst
[3062.70 --> 3063.86]  Lord who are carrying
[3063.86 --> 3064.84]  The burden of loss
[3064.84 --> 3065.98]  We think of the
[3065.98 --> 3066.70]  Grimm and Heinen
[3066.70 --> 3067.72]  And Hanson families
[3067.72 --> 3068.62]  Who are preparing
[3068.62 --> 3069.88]  For the memorial service
[3069.88 --> 3071.08]  For Helen mid-month
[3071.08 --> 3072.98]  We also think of others
[3072.98 --> 3073.68]  Who have lost
[3073.68 --> 3074.86]  Near and dear loved ones
[3074.86 --> 3075.96]  Over the past months
[3075.96 --> 3076.84]  And even years
[3076.84 --> 3078.72]  Lord we read in scripture
[3078.72 --> 3080.02]  That you will wipe away
[3080.02 --> 3081.38]  Every tear from our eyes
[3081.38 --> 3082.84]  And that you are close
[3082.84 --> 3083.94]  To the broken hearted
[3083.94 --> 3085.62]  And that you
[3085.62 --> 3087.38]  You save those
[3087.38 --> 3088.98]  Who are crushed in spirit
[3088.98 --> 3090.50]  Help us Lord
[3090.50 --> 3091.88]  To experience your closeness
[3091.88 --> 3092.72]  And to give you
[3092.72 --> 3093.56]  All of our tears
[3093.56 --> 3094.58]  As we mourn
[3094.58 --> 3095.68]  And grieve our losses
[3095.68 --> 3097.88]  And Lord we lift up
[3097.88 --> 3098.76]  All those that we know
[3098.76 --> 3099.94]  Of that are dealing
[3099.94 --> 3101.62]  With illness and pain
[3101.62 --> 3103.52]  Lord we know and trust
[3103.52 --> 3104.56]  That you are the God
[3104.56 --> 3105.70]  Who heals our diseases
[3105.70 --> 3107.24]  And we ask you
[3107.24 --> 3108.54]  For healing in our lives
[3108.54 --> 3110.48]  We look to the world
[3110.48 --> 3111.14]  Around us Lord
[3111.14 --> 3111.84]  And we confess
[3111.84 --> 3112.80]  That as humanity
[3112.80 --> 3114.20]  We have often failed
[3114.20 --> 3114.88]  To remember
[3114.88 --> 3116.36]  That the earth is yours
[3116.36 --> 3117.48]  And everything in it
[3117.48 --> 3118.36]  The world
[3118.36 --> 3119.32]  And all who live in it
[3119.32 --> 3120.76]  We look at the war
[3120.76 --> 3121.30]  In Ukraine
[3121.30 --> 3122.34]  And Lord we ask
[3122.34 --> 3122.92]  That you perform
[3122.92 --> 3123.80]  Changing works
[3123.80 --> 3124.40]  In the hearts
[3124.40 --> 3124.98]  Of the people
[3124.98 --> 3126.28]  To allow this conflict
[3126.28 --> 3127.38]  To come to an end
[3127.38 --> 3129.42]  We pray for the numerous
[3129.42 --> 3130.32]  Other conflicts
[3130.32 --> 3131.28]  That are taking place
[3131.28 --> 3132.04]  In various places
[3132.04 --> 3132.68]  Around the world
[3132.68 --> 3134.12]  So many Lord
[3134.12 --> 3135.26]  That we cannot name them all
[3135.26 --> 3136.60]  Forgive us
[3136.60 --> 3137.50]  For our indifference
[3137.50 --> 3138.08]  At times
[3138.08 --> 3139.38]  And Lord we pray
[3139.38 --> 3140.70]  For all political leaders
[3140.70 --> 3141.50]  At all levels
[3141.50 --> 3142.90]  That they would serve
[3142.90 --> 3143.64]  With justice
[3143.64 --> 3144.38]  And integrity
[3144.38 --> 3145.72]  And with the authority
[3145.72 --> 3147.06]  That comes from only you
[3147.06 --> 3148.58]  As there is no authority
[3148.58 --> 3149.34]  Except that
[3149.34 --> 3150.44]  Which you have established
[3150.44 --> 3152.36]  We pray Lord
[3152.36 --> 3153.36]  For our church leaders
[3153.36 --> 3154.44]  For the staff
[3154.44 --> 3155.48]  Pastors
[3155.48 --> 3156.70]  Ministry leaders
[3156.70 --> 3158.08]  And for council members
[3158.08 --> 3159.84]  Help each of them Lord
[3159.84 --> 3161.10]  To trust in you
[3161.10 --> 3162.14]  With all their heart
[3162.14 --> 3163.26]  And to lean not on
[3163.26 --> 3164.28]  Their own understanding
[3164.28 --> 3165.60]  We know
[3165.60 --> 3166.80]  That if we acknowledge you
[3166.80 --> 3167.50]  In all our ways
[3167.50 --> 3169.14]  God you will direct our paths
[3169.14 --> 3170.26]  Please help us
[3170.26 --> 3171.08]  To acknowledge you
[3171.08 --> 3171.48]  Always
[3171.48 --> 3172.68]  And in everything
[3172.68 --> 3174.36]  Lord this week
[3174.36 --> 3176.50]  We pray for Jackie and Robin
[3176.50 --> 3177.46]  As they will be traveling
[3177.46 --> 3178.46]  To Grand Rapids
[3178.46 --> 3179.92]  For the worship symposium
[3179.92 --> 3181.18]  We pray God
[3181.18 --> 3181.68]  That you give them
[3181.68 --> 3182.60]  Traveling mercies
[3182.60 --> 3183.94]  And bless this event
[3183.94 --> 3184.94]  And its work
[3184.94 --> 3185.76]  That it might have
[3185.76 --> 3186.82]  A positive impact
[3186.82 --> 3188.60]  And movement forward
[3188.60 --> 3189.46]  In our worship
[3189.46 --> 3190.22]  Here at Emmanuel
[3190.22 --> 3190.78]  As well
[3190.78 --> 3193.52]  Lord we thank you
[3193.52 --> 3194.70]  That we have the opportunity
[3194.70 --> 3195.88]  To participate
[3195.88 --> 3196.70]  In the Lord's Supper
[3196.70 --> 3197.28]  Next week
[3197.28 --> 3198.88]  Help us prepare
[3198.88 --> 3199.50]  Our hearts
[3199.50 --> 3200.50]  And our families
[3200.50 --> 3201.56]  And our relationships
[3201.56 --> 3202.30]  With our brothers
[3202.30 --> 3203.40]  And sisters this week
[3203.40 --> 3205.26]  So that we can come together
[3205.26 --> 3206.08]  To the table
[3206.08 --> 3207.00]  Knowing that we are
[3207.00 --> 3207.56]  One body
[3207.56 --> 3208.52]  And sharing
[3208.52 --> 3209.42]  In the same loaf
[3209.42 --> 3210.54]  Participating
[3210.54 --> 3211.24]  In the body
[3211.24 --> 3212.12]  And blood of Christ
[3212.12 --> 3213.84]  And now Lord
[3213.84 --> 3214.56]  As we turn
[3214.56 --> 3215.42]  To your word
[3215.42 --> 3216.50]  And Pastor Chris
[3216.50 --> 3217.14]  Leads us
[3217.14 --> 3218.18]  Into further study
[3218.18 --> 3218.78]  Of Paul's letter
[3218.78 --> 3219.38]  To the Romans
[3219.38 --> 3220.32]  We ask Lord
[3220.32 --> 3220.88]  That you speak
[3220.88 --> 3221.70]  Your words
[3221.70 --> 3222.56]  To our hearts
[3222.56 --> 3223.42]  Through his message
[3223.42 --> 3224.44]  That the words
[3224.44 --> 3225.02]  Of Christ
[3225.02 --> 3225.92]  Can dwell in us
[3225.92 --> 3226.58]  More richly
[3226.58 --> 3228.28]  We ask all these things
[3228.28 --> 3228.70]  Humbly
[3228.70 --> 3229.24]  In the name
[3229.24 --> 3229.82]  Of our Savior
[3229.82 --> 3230.24]  And Lord
[3230.24 --> 3231.04]  Jesus Christ
[3231.04 --> 3231.74]  Amen
[3242.12 --> 3264.76]  As Ken prayed
[3264.76 --> 3265.60]  We're going to continue
[3265.60 --> 3266.86]  This morning
[3266.86 --> 3267.64]  In our worship
[3267.64 --> 3268.94]  By going back
[3268.94 --> 3269.86]  To the book
[3269.86 --> 3270.46]  Of Romans
[3270.46 --> 3272.20]  We have been
[3272.20 --> 3273.96]  Here for a little bit
[3273.96 --> 3275.52]  We're going to
[3275.52 --> 3276.80]  Read together
[3276.80 --> 3278.76]  From Romans 2
[3278.76 --> 3280.40]  The first 16 verses
[3280.40 --> 3281.58]  It will be on screen
[3281.58 --> 3283.44]  I encourage you
[3283.44 --> 3284.28]  If you have a Bible
[3284.28 --> 3285.52]  To open it up
[3285.52 --> 3286.84]  And keep that open
[3286.84 --> 3287.50]  In front of you
[3287.50 --> 3288.94]  As we're going to
[3288.94 --> 3290.88]  Refer back to it
[3290.88 --> 3291.80]  Pretty regularly
[3291.80 --> 3292.22]  Throughout
[3292.22 --> 3294.28]  While you are finding it
[3294.28 --> 3295.46]  I want to begin
[3295.46 --> 3296.04]  Just with a
[3296.04 --> 3297.22]  Bit of a story
[3297.22 --> 3300.16]  Before I went
[3300.16 --> 3301.28]  To university
[3301.28 --> 3302.34]  Before I became
[3302.34 --> 3302.98]  A pastor
[3302.98 --> 3305.24]  I spent a year
[3305.24 --> 3305.92]  And then
[3305.92 --> 3307.40]  While I was in school
[3307.40 --> 3308.50]  The next six
[3308.50 --> 3309.66]  Or seven of them
[3309.66 --> 3311.62]  Learning how to build houses
[3311.62 --> 3313.30]  And learning framing
[3313.30 --> 3315.94]  And so the first year
[3315.94 --> 3317.06]  That I did so
[3317.06 --> 3318.88]  I worked with my cousin
[3318.88 --> 3319.66]  And my uncle
[3319.66 --> 3320.80]  And we were building houses
[3320.80 --> 3322.16]  In Ontario
[3322.16 --> 3323.08]  In subdivisions
[3323.08 --> 3324.48]  And if you've ever
[3324.48 --> 3325.84]  Framed subdivision houses
[3325.84 --> 3326.68]  You know you've got
[3326.68 --> 3327.92]  Three or five days
[3327.92 --> 3329.02]  To get the framing done
[3329.02 --> 3329.68]  Because then
[3329.68 --> 3331.26]  The next crew is coming in
[3331.26 --> 3332.52]  And the next crew is coming in
[3332.52 --> 3333.98]  And they crank him out
[3333.98 --> 3334.48]  Pretty quick
[3334.48 --> 3335.66]  And so it's not always
[3335.66 --> 3336.42]  The best environment
[3336.42 --> 3337.90]  To learn how to frame
[3337.90 --> 3339.48]  Because you're moving
[3339.48 --> 3340.78]  Really quickly
[3340.78 --> 3342.66]  And I'll never forget
[3342.66 --> 3344.96]  Must have been my second
[3344.96 --> 3345.90]  Or third day
[3345.90 --> 3346.86]  On the job
[3346.86 --> 3348.78]  And there was
[3348.78 --> 3349.78]  A point where
[3349.78 --> 3351.22]  I had to nail together
[3351.22 --> 3351.98]  Two boards
[3351.98 --> 3352.84]  That were overhead
[3352.84 --> 3354.10]  But there was only
[3354.10 --> 3355.90]  Like a six inch gap
[3355.90 --> 3357.56]  Where I could get my hammer
[3357.56 --> 3360.04]  And then a three and a half inch spike
[3360.04 --> 3361.86]  To try and nail it in
[3361.86 --> 3363.74]  And so I couldn't actually
[3363.74 --> 3365.38]  Like swing really well
[3365.38 --> 3366.08]  Right
[3366.08 --> 3366.94]  And I ended up
[3366.94 --> 3368.58]  Turning the hammer sideways
[3368.58 --> 3370.02]  Some of you know
[3370.02 --> 3370.96]  This little trick right
[3370.96 --> 3371.60]  And then you use the
[3371.60 --> 3373.02]  The flat of the crux
[3373.02 --> 3373.48]  Of the hammer
[3373.48 --> 3375.08]  And then you slowly tap
[3375.08 --> 3379.12]  There I tapped
[3379.12 --> 3379.64]  And I tapped
[3379.64 --> 3380.16]  And I tapped
[3380.16 --> 3380.68]  And I tapped
[3380.68 --> 3381.68]  With futility
[3381.68 --> 3382.72]  Because the dale
[3382.72 --> 3383.52]  Just wasn't going in
[3383.52 --> 3384.32]  I couldn't get enough
[3384.32 --> 3385.70]  Force behind it
[3385.70 --> 3387.06]  And so for about
[3387.06 --> 3387.82]  Twenty minutes
[3387.82 --> 3389.70]  I stood there
[3389.70 --> 3390.74]  Trying to bang
[3390.74 --> 3391.80]  These nails in
[3391.80 --> 3392.80]  And I look over
[3392.80 --> 3393.46]  My shoulder
[3393.46 --> 3394.24]  And my uncle
[3394.24 --> 3395.12]  Who was the foreman
[3395.12 --> 3395.66]  At the time
[3395.66 --> 3397.32]  Is just laughing
[3397.32 --> 3398.30]  Away
[3398.30 --> 3400.74]  Looking at me
[3400.74 --> 3401.84]  Shaking his head
[3401.84 --> 3403.62]  He goes
[3403.62 --> 3403.92]  Chris
[3403.92 --> 3404.92]  What are you doing?
[3405.38 --> 3405.56]  I'm like
[3405.56 --> 3406.14]  I don't know
[3406.14 --> 3407.36]  It's your job
[3407.36 --> 3408.04]  You're supposed
[3408.04 --> 3408.90]  To teach me this
[3408.90 --> 3410.34]  He goes
[3410.34 --> 3410.58]  Well
[3410.58 --> 3411.88]  First of all
[3411.88 --> 3413.22]  You're using
[3413.22 --> 3414.06]  Your hammer wrong
[3414.06 --> 3415.56]  Well
[3415.56 --> 3416.46]  I know
[3416.46 --> 3416.86]  That this is
[3416.86 --> 3416.98]  How
[3416.98 --> 3418.80]  This is good enough
[3418.80 --> 3419.44]  Isn't it?
[3420.40 --> 3420.64]  It's like
[3420.64 --> 3421.24]  Well is it working?
[3422.46 --> 3422.90]  No
[3422.90 --> 3424.16]  Well then it's not
[3424.16 --> 3424.76]  Good enough
[3424.76 --> 3425.18]  Is it?
[3426.06 --> 3426.66]  Fair point
[3426.66 --> 3427.48]  Turns out
[3427.48 --> 3427.98]  There's this thing
[3427.98 --> 3428.94]  Called a palm nailer
[3428.94 --> 3429.56]  You plug it into
[3429.56 --> 3430.22]  An air compressor
[3430.22 --> 3430.76]  And you just push
[3430.76 --> 3431.18]  It on the nail
[3431.18 --> 3431.32]  And it's
[3431.32 --> 3432.24]  Done
[3432.24 --> 3433.16]  Took about
[3433.16 --> 3433.84]  Thirty seconds
[3433.84 --> 3434.64]  Once he showed me
[3434.64 --> 3435.56]  What it was to do
[3435.56 --> 3437.36]  Why do I share
[3437.36 --> 3437.82]  That story
[3437.82 --> 3438.66]  As we come into this?
[3438.90 --> 3439.50]  Introduction
[3439.50 --> 3441.96]  There are times
[3441.96 --> 3442.76]  And circumstances
[3442.76 --> 3443.70]  And Paul is going to
[3443.70 --> 3444.76]  Help us see that
[3444.76 --> 3445.28]  Right?
[3445.36 --> 3446.72]  Where in our life
[3446.72 --> 3447.38]  We say
[3447.38 --> 3448.56]  Good enough
[3448.56 --> 3450.70]  And it's still
[3450.70 --> 3452.44]  Not done right
[3452.44 --> 3453.76]  Right?
[3453.80 --> 3454.76]  Where we do the same thing
[3454.76 --> 3455.92]  Over and over and over again
[3455.92 --> 3460.02]  And we say
[3460.02 --> 3461.38]  That should take care of it
[3461.38 --> 3463.30]  And it's still
[3463.30 --> 3465.16]  Not right
[3465.16 --> 3466.82]  Hold that image
[3466.82 --> 3466.84]  Hold that image
[3466.84 --> 3467.46]  In your mind
[3467.46 --> 3468.32]  As we read
[3468.32 --> 3469.60]  Romans 2
[3469.60 --> 3471.06]  1-16
[3471.06 --> 3477.20]  You therefore
[3477.20 --> 3479.32]  Have no excuse
[3479.32 --> 3481.60]  You who pass judgment
[3481.60 --> 3483.38]  On someone else
[3483.38 --> 3485.20]  For at whatever point
[3485.20 --> 3486.24]  You judge another
[3486.24 --> 3488.04]  You are condemning yourself
[3488.04 --> 3490.52]  Because you who pass judgment
[3490.52 --> 3492.84]  Do the same things
[3492.84 --> 3494.64]  Now we know
[3494.64 --> 3495.66]  That God's judgment
[3495.66 --> 3496.54]  Against those
[3496.54 --> 3497.58]  Who do such things
[3497.58 --> 3498.84]  Is based on truth
[3498.84 --> 3499.80]  So when you
[3499.80 --> 3500.86]  A mere human being
[3500.86 --> 3502.06]  Pass judgment on them
[3502.06 --> 3503.84]  And yet do the same things
[3503.84 --> 3504.84]  Do you think
[3504.84 --> 3505.54]  You will escape
[3505.54 --> 3506.28]  God's judgment?
[3507.28 --> 3508.60]  Or do you show
[3508.60 --> 3509.24]  Contempt
[3509.24 --> 3510.34]  For the riches
[3510.34 --> 3511.46]  Of his kindness
[3511.46 --> 3512.30]  Forbearance
[3512.30 --> 3512.88]  And patience
[3512.88 --> 3514.22]  Not realizing
[3514.22 --> 3515.50]  That God's kindness
[3515.50 --> 3516.34]  Is intended
[3516.34 --> 3517.44]  To lead you
[3517.44 --> 3518.30]  To repentance
[3518.30 --> 3521.92]  But because of
[3521.92 --> 3523.02]  Your stubbornness
[3523.02 --> 3524.42]  And your unrepentant heart
[3524.42 --> 3526.00]  You are storing up
[3526.00 --> 3526.78]  Wrath
[3526.78 --> 3527.86]  Against yourself
[3527.86 --> 3528.82]  For the day
[3528.82 --> 3530.18]  Of God's wrath
[3530.18 --> 3531.70]  When his righteous judgment
[3531.70 --> 3532.56]  Will be revealed
[3532.56 --> 3535.58]  God will repay
[3535.58 --> 3536.42]  Each person
[3536.42 --> 3537.34]  According to what
[3537.34 --> 3537.90]  They have done
[3537.90 --> 3539.30]  To those
[3539.30 --> 3540.50]  Who by persistence
[3540.50 --> 3541.60]  In doing good
[3541.60 --> 3542.48]  Seek glory
[3542.48 --> 3543.10]  Honor
[3543.10 --> 3544.30]  And immortality
[3544.30 --> 3545.94]  He will give
[3545.94 --> 3546.80]  Eternal life
[3546.80 --> 3548.68]  But for those
[3548.68 --> 3550.06]  Who are self-seeking
[3550.06 --> 3551.20]  And who reject the truth
[3551.20 --> 3552.08]  And who follow evil
[3552.08 --> 3553.34]  There will be wrath
[3553.34 --> 3553.96]  And anger
[3553.96 --> 3556.26]  There will be trouble
[3556.26 --> 3557.00]  And distress
[3557.00 --> 3558.54]  For every human being
[3558.54 --> 3559.38]  Who does evil
[3559.38 --> 3560.64]  First for the Jew
[3560.64 --> 3561.92]  Then for the Gentile
[3561.92 --> 3563.30]  But glory
[3563.30 --> 3563.62]  Honor
[3563.62 --> 3564.18]  And peace
[3564.18 --> 3564.92]  For everyone
[3564.92 --> 3566.02]  Who does good
[3566.02 --> 3567.08]  First for the Jew
[3567.08 --> 3568.62]  Then for the Gentile
[3568.62 --> 3570.16]  For God does not
[3570.16 --> 3571.48]  Show favoritism
[3571.48 --> 3573.80]  All who sin
[3573.80 --> 3575.18]  Apart from the law
[3575.18 --> 3576.30]  Will also perish
[3576.30 --> 3577.60]  Apart from the law
[3577.60 --> 3578.34]  And all who sin
[3578.34 --> 3579.28]  Under the law
[3579.28 --> 3580.38]  Will be judged
[3580.38 --> 3581.62]  By the law
[3581.62 --> 3582.92]  For it is not
[3582.92 --> 3584.34]  Those who hear the law
[3584.34 --> 3585.44]  Who are righteous
[3585.44 --> 3586.28]  In God's sight
[3586.28 --> 3586.82]  But it is those
[3586.82 --> 3588.12]  Who obey the law
[3588.12 --> 3589.06]  Who are declared
[3589.06 --> 3590.02]  Righteous
[3590.02 --> 3591.46]  Indeed
[3591.46 --> 3592.90]  When Gentiles
[3592.90 --> 3593.96]  Who do not have the law
[3593.96 --> 3594.74]  Do by nature
[3594.74 --> 3596.22]  Things required by the law
[3596.22 --> 3597.16]  They are a law
[3597.16 --> 3598.00]  Unto themselves
[3598.00 --> 3598.96]  Even though
[3598.96 --> 3600.14]  They do not have the law
[3600.14 --> 3601.66]  They show
[3601.66 --> 3602.46]  That the requirements
[3602.46 --> 3603.20]  Of the law
[3603.20 --> 3604.48]  Are written on their hearts
[3604.48 --> 3605.66]  Their consciences
[3605.66 --> 3606.82]  Also bearing witness
[3606.82 --> 3608.84]  And their thoughts
[3608.84 --> 3610.52]  Sometimes accuse them
[3610.52 --> 3612.04]  And at other times
[3612.04 --> 3613.24]  Even defending them
[3613.24 --> 3615.58]  This will take place
[3615.58 --> 3616.16]  On the day
[3616.16 --> 3617.24]  When God judges
[3617.24 --> 3618.22]  People's secrets
[3618.22 --> 3619.66]  Through Jesus Christ
[3619.66 --> 3622.18]  As my gospel declares
[3622.18 --> 3624.60]  This is the word of the Lord
[3624.60 --> 3630.18]  Now
[3630.18 --> 3633.24]  Probably don't have to
[3633.24 --> 3634.44]  Tell you this
[3634.44 --> 3636.30]  But for clarity's sake
[3636.30 --> 3637.62]  That we live
[3637.62 --> 3638.62]  In a time
[3638.62 --> 3639.70]  And a place
[3639.70 --> 3641.20]  That tells us
[3641.20 --> 3641.78]  Generally
[3641.78 --> 3643.20]  That good enough
[3643.20 --> 3644.76]  Is good enough
[3644.76 --> 3647.44]  What we will see
[3647.44 --> 3648.14]  In the letter
[3648.14 --> 3649.04]  To the Romans
[3649.04 --> 3649.74]  Today
[3649.74 --> 3651.96]  Is that good enough
[3651.96 --> 3653.16]  Isn't
[3653.16 --> 3654.70]  Good enough
[3654.70 --> 3656.22]  Right
[3656.22 --> 3657.22]  For all our
[3657.22 --> 3658.24]  Religious effort
[3658.24 --> 3660.34]  We need the gospel
[3660.34 --> 3662.42]  Good enough
[3662.42 --> 3664.02]  Isn't going to be
[3664.02 --> 3665.88]  Good enough
[3665.88 --> 3667.90]  Paul begins
[3667.90 --> 3668.76]  In verse 1
[3668.76 --> 3669.30]  Of our text
[3669.30 --> 3671.14]  He starts by saying
[3671.14 --> 3672.48]  In one sentence
[3672.48 --> 3673.30]  Almost what
[3673.30 --> 3674.52]  Pastor Kevin said
[3674.52 --> 3675.68]  Two weeks ago
[3675.68 --> 3676.46]  He says
[3676.46 --> 3678.36]  You have no excuse
[3678.36 --> 3679.74]  You judge others
[3679.74 --> 3680.58]  But fail
[3680.58 --> 3681.50]  In another way
[3681.50 --> 3682.08]  Right
[3682.08 --> 3683.80]  At whatever point
[3683.80 --> 3684.74]  You judge another
[3684.74 --> 3686.32]  You are condemning yourself
[3686.32 --> 3687.40]  Because you do
[3687.40 --> 3688.68]  The same things
[3688.68 --> 3689.42]  Now really quickly
[3689.42 --> 3689.72]  Notice
[3689.72 --> 3690.06]  He says
[3690.06 --> 3691.28]  Same things
[3691.28 --> 3693.38]  Not the same thing
[3693.38 --> 3695.10]  Right
[3695.10 --> 3695.98]  Paul isn't saying
[3695.98 --> 3696.86]  That we all commit
[3696.86 --> 3698.18]  The same sin
[3698.18 --> 3699.12]  But he's saying
[3699.12 --> 3699.76]  That we are all
[3699.76 --> 3701.32]  Under sin
[3701.32 --> 3702.00]  Right
[3702.00 --> 3702.98]  We've all
[3702.98 --> 3703.98]  And Kevin made this point
[3703.98 --> 3704.46]  Really well
[3704.46 --> 3705.54]  Suppressed the truth
[3705.54 --> 3706.98]  Of God's revelation
[3706.98 --> 3708.22]  We've all exchanged
[3708.22 --> 3709.18]  God for some
[3709.18 --> 3710.38]  Idolatry
[3710.38 --> 3711.54]  And that shows up
[3711.54 --> 3712.18]  In our lives
[3712.18 --> 3713.54]  In big or small
[3713.54 --> 3716.12]  In practical or impractical
[3716.12 --> 3718.22]  In wicked and seemingly
[3718.22 --> 3719.92]  Minor ways
[3719.92 --> 3720.62]  Maybe even
[3720.62 --> 3723.14]  In innocuous ways
[3723.14 --> 3727.32]  The big picture point
[3727.32 --> 3728.94]  That Paul I think
[3728.94 --> 3730.28]  Wants us to see
[3730.28 --> 3731.32]  In this letter
[3731.32 --> 3732.08]  At this point
[3732.08 --> 3733.70]  Is what do we do
[3733.70 --> 3735.74]  When we realize
[3735.74 --> 3737.78]  That truth
[3737.78 --> 3740.28]  Right
[3740.28 --> 3740.88]  It's the
[3740.88 --> 3742.74]  Moralist
[3742.74 --> 3744.16]  Among us
[3744.16 --> 3745.30]  Who might say
[3745.30 --> 3747.24]  That my stuff
[3747.24 --> 3748.36]  Isn't so bad
[3748.36 --> 3749.96]  Or
[3749.96 --> 3750.66]  We might
[3750.66 --> 3751.98]  Maybe we're more likely
[3751.98 --> 3752.30]  To say
[3752.30 --> 3753.36]  My stuff
[3753.36 --> 3754.16]  Isn't as bad
[3754.16 --> 3755.98]  As his stuff
[3755.98 --> 3757.46]  Right
[3757.46 --> 3757.86]  And we kind of
[3757.86 --> 3758.34]  Look around
[3758.34 --> 3758.98]  And as long as
[3758.98 --> 3759.52]  There's someone
[3759.52 --> 3760.50]  Worse than us
[3760.50 --> 3761.52]  In our sort of sphere
[3761.52 --> 3762.10]  We're like
[3762.10 --> 3762.30]  Yeah
[3762.30 --> 3763.08]  It's good enough
[3763.08 --> 3764.76]  It's okay
[3764.76 --> 3767.12]  It's the religious
[3767.12 --> 3768.04]  Moralist
[3768.04 --> 3768.54]  Who says
[3768.54 --> 3769.36]  You know
[3769.36 --> 3770.22]  I just need to do
[3770.22 --> 3770.98]  A little bit better
[3770.98 --> 3772.50]  I just need to avoid
[3772.50 --> 3773.90]  The really bad stuff
[3773.90 --> 3774.84]  And then
[3774.84 --> 3776.62]  Balance the scales
[3776.62 --> 3778.40]  With some really good stuff
[3778.40 --> 3779.86]  And it'll be okay
[3779.86 --> 3782.56]  The religious point
[3782.56 --> 3783.58]  That Paul is
[3783.58 --> 3784.48]  Addressing
[3784.48 --> 3786.36]  Is the one that says
[3786.36 --> 3787.20]  God
[3787.20 --> 3788.22]  God or the gods
[3788.22 --> 3788.84]  Right
[3788.84 --> 3790.54]  Want a good person
[3790.54 --> 3792.28]  And if you do
[3792.28 --> 3793.28]  The right things
[3793.28 --> 3795.08]  You'll get the reward
[3795.08 --> 3797.12]  Whatever that reward
[3797.12 --> 3797.52]  Might be
[3797.52 --> 3798.34]  Or however you might
[3798.34 --> 3799.08]  Define that
[3799.08 --> 3801.36]  Now this way of thinking
[3801.36 --> 3802.30]  About life
[3802.30 --> 3803.02]  In the world
[3803.02 --> 3803.50]  And about
[3803.50 --> 3805.14]  Relationship to God
[3805.14 --> 3805.96]  Or not
[3805.96 --> 3807.30]  Relationship in the world
[3807.30 --> 3808.46]  Was common
[3808.46 --> 3809.68]  In Paul's day
[3809.68 --> 3810.50]  And really
[3810.50 --> 3811.32]  It continues
[3811.32 --> 3812.24]  Through
[3812.24 --> 3813.14]  Into today
[3813.14 --> 3815.12]  The idea is
[3815.12 --> 3816.12]  That if you do good
[3816.12 --> 3817.44]  You will be blessed
[3817.44 --> 3818.76]  Right
[3818.76 --> 3819.80]  If you do the right thing
[3819.80 --> 3821.26]  You'll get good things
[3821.26 --> 3822.98]  And there's actually
[3822.98 --> 3824.94]  A religious version
[3824.94 --> 3826.28]  Of this idea
[3826.28 --> 3827.36]  Right
[3827.36 --> 3828.78]  Have you ever heard
[3828.78 --> 3829.54]  Someone say
[3829.54 --> 3831.40]  Maybe it's a friend
[3831.40 --> 3831.98]  At school
[3831.98 --> 3833.72]  Maybe it's one of your kids
[3833.72 --> 3834.54]  Or someone you work with
[3834.54 --> 3835.06]  But they say
[3835.06 --> 3836.04]  Something like
[3836.04 --> 3837.70]  You know
[3837.70 --> 3840.06]  I don't really need
[3840.06 --> 3841.44]  Church in my life
[3841.44 --> 3842.32]  To be good
[3842.32 --> 3844.36]  I can just be good
[3844.36 --> 3845.38]  Right
[3845.38 --> 3846.38]  I don't need to believe
[3846.38 --> 3846.98]  In God
[3846.98 --> 3848.90]  To be a moral person
[3848.90 --> 3849.76]  I can just be
[3849.76 --> 3850.72]  A moral person
[3850.72 --> 3852.42]  Right
[3852.42 --> 3853.50]  I'm calling that
[3853.50 --> 3854.32]  Idea
[3854.32 --> 3855.74]  A religious version
[3855.74 --> 3856.28]  Of this
[3856.28 --> 3857.64]  Because behind it
[3857.64 --> 3858.48]  There's this almost
[3858.48 --> 3860.38]  Dogmatic assumption
[3860.38 --> 3861.52]  Right
[3861.52 --> 3861.94]  There's this
[3861.94 --> 3863.08]  Faith claim
[3863.08 --> 3864.12]  That
[3864.12 --> 3864.72]  You know
[3864.72 --> 3865.54]  Being a quote
[3865.54 --> 3866.66]  Good person
[3866.66 --> 3867.72]  Is the point
[3867.72 --> 3868.18]  Of it all
[3868.18 --> 3870.78]  And this is pretty
[3870.78 --> 3871.60]  Comprehensive in our
[3871.60 --> 3872.36]  Society today
[3872.36 --> 3872.98]  In fact
[3872.98 --> 3874.62]  A few years ago
[3874.62 --> 3876.62]  There was a
[3876.62 --> 3878.08]  Study done by
[3878.08 --> 3878.86]  A group of
[3878.86 --> 3880.26]  Social scientists
[3880.26 --> 3881.50]  Of
[3881.50 --> 3883.28]  Primarily young people
[3883.28 --> 3883.92]  People in their
[3883.92 --> 3884.78]  Early twenties
[3884.78 --> 3887.86]  And the
[3887.86 --> 3888.94]  Study was published
[3888.94 --> 3889.80]  Under the title
[3889.80 --> 3891.06]  Of renegotiating faith
[3891.06 --> 3892.36]  But they're trying
[3892.36 --> 3893.60]  To engage in this
[3893.60 --> 3894.60]  Demographic
[3894.60 --> 3895.54]  Of society
[3895.54 --> 3896.52]  That is increasingly
[3896.52 --> 3897.76]  Dominated by
[3897.76 --> 3899.68]  Post-Christian ideas
[3899.68 --> 3900.98]  Or living in the
[3900.98 --> 3901.86]  Midst of post-Christian
[3901.86 --> 3902.32]  Ideas
[3902.32 --> 3903.70]  And that study
[3903.70 --> 3904.74]  Found that many
[3904.74 --> 3906.46]  Young Canadian people
[3906.46 --> 3908.36]  Live with an idea
[3908.36 --> 3909.68]  That these sociologists
[3909.68 --> 3910.92]  Summarized as
[3910.92 --> 3912.90]  U-G-R-E
[3912.90 --> 3916.14]  It's phonetically
[3916.14 --> 3916.56]  Incorrect
[3916.56 --> 3917.14]  But I just call it
[3917.14 --> 3917.44]  Ogre
[3917.44 --> 3918.20]  Because it's easier
[3918.20 --> 3918.72]  To remember
[3918.72 --> 3921.32]  But U-G-R-E
[3921.32 --> 3922.00]  Stands for
[3922.00 --> 3923.48]  Universal Gnostic
[3923.48 --> 3925.02]  Religious Ethic
[3925.02 --> 3926.92]  Now they call it
[3926.92 --> 3927.46]  Universal
[3927.46 --> 3929.04]  Because there is
[3929.04 --> 3929.80]  An idea
[3929.80 --> 3930.44]  And a belief
[3930.44 --> 3931.60]  That behind all
[3931.60 --> 3932.54]  Religions
[3932.54 --> 3933.80]  And something
[3933.80 --> 3934.62]  That all people
[3934.62 --> 3935.50]  Share
[3935.50 --> 3936.34]  Is the truth
[3936.34 --> 3937.16]  That religions
[3937.16 --> 3938.32]  Ultimately serve
[3938.32 --> 3939.72]  A social
[3939.72 --> 3942.10]  And psychological
[3942.10 --> 3943.16]  Function
[3943.16 --> 3945.70]  Now they call it
[3945.70 --> 3946.16]  Gnostic
[3946.16 --> 3948.06]  Because behind it
[3948.06 --> 3948.58]  All is this
[3948.58 --> 3949.28]  Belief
[3949.28 --> 3950.82]  About or an idea
[3950.82 --> 3952.16]  That this truth
[3952.16 --> 3952.84]  This way
[3952.84 --> 3953.48]  Of seeing
[3953.48 --> 3954.08]  And being
[3954.08 --> 3954.78]  In the world
[3954.78 --> 3955.94]  Is a truth
[3955.94 --> 3956.96]  That this current
[3956.96 --> 3957.56]  Generation
[3957.56 --> 3958.70]  Of twenty-somethings
[3958.70 --> 3959.74]  Has discovered
[3959.74 --> 3960.62]  To be true
[3960.62 --> 3961.68]  And that this new
[3961.68 --> 3962.36]  Way of seeing
[3962.36 --> 3962.96]  The world
[3962.96 --> 3964.06]  Has never existed
[3964.06 --> 3964.50]  Before
[3964.50 --> 3965.86]  It's a special
[3965.86 --> 3966.40]  Knowledge
[3966.40 --> 3967.74]  Now anyone
[3967.74 --> 3968.12]  Anyone who knows
[3968.12 --> 3968.66]  Church history
[3968.66 --> 3969.28]  Might challenge
[3969.28 --> 3969.80]  That assumption
[3969.80 --> 3970.30]  But anyway
[3970.30 --> 3970.94]  There it is
[3970.94 --> 3971.96]  Right
[3971.96 --> 3972.52]  And the
[3972.52 --> 3973.60]  The kicker here
[3973.60 --> 3974.18]  Is that
[3974.18 --> 3975.36]  This is something
[3975.36 --> 3977.44]  That this generation
[3977.44 --> 3980.68]  Believes
[3980.68 --> 3982.58]  That their parents
[3982.58 --> 3983.92]  Will never understand
[3983.92 --> 3984.28]  That
[3984.28 --> 3986.62]  That this is a special
[3986.62 --> 3987.36]  Thing that they
[3987.36 --> 3987.96]  Have learned
[3987.96 --> 3988.84]  Or discovered
[3988.84 --> 3989.50]  About how to be
[3989.50 --> 3990.06]  And function
[3990.06 --> 3991.20]  In the world
[3991.20 --> 3994.16]  Now it's religious
[3994.16 --> 3994.94]  Right
[3994.94 --> 3995.56]  Because it
[3995.56 --> 3996.72]  It still finds
[3996.72 --> 3997.24]  A way
[3997.24 --> 3997.96]  To relate
[3997.96 --> 3998.62]  To a higher
[3998.62 --> 3999.20]  Power
[3999.20 --> 4000.26]  And here
[4000.26 --> 4000.66]  You're getting
[4000.66 --> 4001.16]  The language
[4001.16 --> 4001.70]  Of a more
[4001.70 --> 4002.78]  General spirituality
[4002.78 --> 4003.54]  But there's also
[4003.54 --> 4004.80]  Even an active
[4004.80 --> 4005.36]  Magic
[4005.36 --> 4006.74]  That exists
[4006.74 --> 4007.78]  In the world
[4007.78 --> 4009.78]  And that historical
[4009.78 --> 4010.76]  Institutional
[4010.76 --> 4011.48]  Religion
[4011.48 --> 4013.56]  Is cast off
[4013.56 --> 4014.52]  Because it has
[4014.52 --> 4015.48]  Limited this
[4015.48 --> 4016.66]  Expression
[4016.66 --> 4018.02]  And then
[4018.02 --> 4018.62]  At the end
[4018.62 --> 4019.12]  Of Ogre
[4019.12 --> 4019.54]  It's called
[4019.54 --> 4020.04]  An ethic
[4020.04 --> 4021.14]  Because it's about
[4021.14 --> 4022.26]  Good social
[4022.26 --> 4022.92]  Behavior
[4022.92 --> 4023.68]  Culminating
[4023.68 --> 4024.38]  In a concept
[4024.38 --> 4025.52]  Of absolute
[4025.52 --> 4027.08]  Social tolerance
[4027.08 --> 4030.18]  And what you hear
[4030.18 --> 4030.70]  I hope
[4030.70 --> 4031.92]  Tying all of this
[4031.92 --> 4032.38]  Together
[4032.38 --> 4033.92]  Is the idea
[4033.92 --> 4034.44]  About
[4034.44 --> 4036.54]  How each one
[4036.54 --> 4037.72]  Does good
[4037.72 --> 4038.54]  Right
[4038.54 --> 4039.60]  And is called
[4039.60 --> 4040.78]  To be good
[4040.78 --> 4041.72]  For the betterment
[4041.72 --> 4042.54]  Of society
[4042.54 --> 4043.14]  That becomes
[4043.14 --> 4044.04]  The purpose
[4044.04 --> 4045.18]  Of everything
[4045.18 --> 4047.60]  Right
[4047.60 --> 4048.40]  Do good
[4048.40 --> 4049.58]  And be good
[4049.58 --> 4050.42]  And don't hurt
[4050.42 --> 4050.80]  Others
[4050.80 --> 4052.82]  Now don't hear
[4052.82 --> 4053.48]  What I'm not saying
[4053.48 --> 4054.32]  Because I want you
[4054.32 --> 4054.84]  To do good
[4054.84 --> 4055.44]  And be good
[4055.44 --> 4056.10]  And don't hurt
[4056.10 --> 4056.48]  Others
[4056.48 --> 4058.22]  Okay
[4058.22 --> 4058.92]  Those are good
[4058.92 --> 4060.02]  Values
[4060.02 --> 4060.58]  The desire
[4060.58 --> 4061.50]  To love others
[4061.50 --> 4062.08]  The desire
[4062.08 --> 4063.62]  To love our neighbor
[4063.62 --> 4064.42]  As ourselves
[4064.42 --> 4064.96]  The desire
[4064.96 --> 4065.58]  To care
[4065.58 --> 4066.46]  For the least
[4066.46 --> 4066.82]  Of these
[4066.82 --> 4067.66]  And the marginalized
[4067.66 --> 4068.84]  Are deeply
[4068.84 --> 4069.88]  Good
[4069.88 --> 4070.62]  Good
[4070.62 --> 4071.90]  Values
[4071.90 --> 4073.88]  Right
[4073.88 --> 4074.64]  And ultimately
[4074.64 --> 4075.70]  It's
[4075.70 --> 4075.90]  It's
[4075.90 --> 4078.88]  It's what we are
[4078.88 --> 4081.04]  Called to live
[4081.04 --> 4081.34]  In
[4081.34 --> 4082.36]  Into the direction
[4082.36 --> 4083.40]  Of and towards
[4083.40 --> 4084.40]  Words
[4084.40 --> 4086.02]  But to make
[4086.02 --> 4086.98]  Ultimate
[4086.98 --> 4088.84]  Something that is
[4088.84 --> 4089.72]  Supposed to be
[4089.72 --> 4090.72]  A consequence
[4090.72 --> 4092.48]  Of relationship
[4092.48 --> 4093.34]  To the ultimate
[4093.34 --> 4095.12]  Is where we start
[4095.12 --> 4095.74]  Going awry
[4095.74 --> 4097.52]  Right
[4097.52 --> 4098.52]  In fact
[4098.52 --> 4100.60]  What's likely
[4100.60 --> 4101.06]  To happen
[4101.06 --> 4101.74]  When you do
[4101.74 --> 4102.42]  That is to get
[4102.42 --> 4102.96]  The inverse
[4102.96 --> 4103.44]  Of what you
[4103.44 --> 4103.96]  Would expect
[4103.96 --> 4105.72]  So to say
[4105.72 --> 4105.98]  That
[4105.98 --> 4106.76]  Well we hope
[4106.76 --> 4107.40]  For social
[4107.40 --> 4108.18]  Tolerance
[4108.18 --> 4109.48]  When we begin
[4109.48 --> 4110.24]  To equate
[4110.24 --> 4111.08]  What you do
[4111.08 --> 4111.96]  With who you
[4111.96 --> 4112.44]  Are
[4112.44 --> 4113.38]  We actually
[4113.38 --> 4113.98]  End up with
[4113.98 --> 4115.26]  An intolerant
[4115.26 --> 4115.80]  Society
[4115.80 --> 4116.62]  Because you
[4116.62 --> 4117.32]  Affirm
[4117.32 --> 4118.34]  Or unless
[4118.34 --> 4119.02]  You affirm
[4119.02 --> 4119.84]  What I do
[4119.84 --> 4120.64]  You're denying
[4120.64 --> 4121.56]  Who I am
[4121.56 --> 4123.10]  And that's
[4123.10 --> 4123.76]  Unacceptable
[4123.76 --> 4124.92]  That's the
[4124.92 --> 4125.56]  Unforgivable
[4125.56 --> 4126.38]  Sin of the
[4126.38 --> 4127.32]  21st century
[4127.32 --> 4128.34]  Modern world
[4128.34 --> 4130.66]  And as we
[4130.66 --> 4131.32]  Look at this
[4131.32 --> 4131.94]  Religious
[4131.94 --> 4132.80]  Assumption
[4132.80 --> 4133.68]  About what it
[4133.68 --> 4134.26]  Means to do
[4134.26 --> 4134.86]  Good in the
[4134.86 --> 4135.20]  World
[4135.20 --> 4136.08]  And as we
[4136.08 --> 4136.48]  Do so
[4136.48 --> 4137.04]  Critically
[4137.04 --> 4138.30]  I need you
[4138.30 --> 4138.78]  To see
[4138.78 --> 4139.56]  That there's
[4139.56 --> 4140.62]  Actually something
[4140.62 --> 4141.58]  Deeper
[4141.58 --> 4142.36]  That's going
[4142.36 --> 4142.86]  On here
[4142.86 --> 4143.40]  That this is
[4143.40 --> 4144.46]  Actually based
[4144.46 --> 4144.82]  On
[4144.82 --> 4145.70]  I want to
[4145.70 --> 4146.38]  Suggest to you
[4146.38 --> 4147.04]  That Paul's
[4147.04 --> 4147.62]  Point or
[4147.62 --> 4148.52]  Part of Paul's
[4148.52 --> 4149.02]  Point the
[4149.02 --> 4149.72]  Foundation here
[4149.72 --> 4151.10]  In Romans 2
[4151.10 --> 4151.92]  Is this
[4151.92 --> 4152.50]  Deeper
[4152.50 --> 4153.12]  Thing
[4153.12 --> 4154.06]  And so look
[4154.06 --> 4154.38]  At what he
[4154.38 --> 4154.64]  Writes
[4154.64 --> 4154.98]  Look at
[4154.98 --> 4155.88]  Verse 7
[4155.88 --> 4158.32]  He says
[4158.32 --> 4159.84]  To those
[4159.84 --> 4160.36]  Who by
[4160.36 --> 4161.12]  Persistence
[4161.12 --> 4161.60]  In doing
[4161.60 --> 4161.92]  Good
[4161.92 --> 4162.56]  Seek glory
[4162.56 --> 4162.86]  Honor
[4162.86 --> 4163.66]  And immortality
[4163.66 --> 4164.18]  He will
[4164.18 --> 4165.12]  Give eternal
[4165.12 --> 4165.90]  Life
[4165.90 --> 4166.92]  Look at
[4166.92 --> 4167.40]  Verse 10
[4167.40 --> 4168.32]  Glory
[4168.32 --> 4168.68]  Honor
[4168.68 --> 4169.32]  And peace
[4169.32 --> 4170.30]  For everyone
[4170.30 --> 4171.06]  Who does
[4171.06 --> 4171.86]  Good
[4171.86 --> 4172.66]  Right
[4172.66 --> 4172.92]  And then
[4172.92 --> 4173.72]  Verse 14
[4173.72 --> 4174.66]  He continues
[4174.66 --> 4174.98]  He says
[4174.98 --> 4175.72]  When Gentiles
[4175.72 --> 4176.18]  Who do not
[4176.18 --> 4176.80]  Have the law
[4176.80 --> 4177.48]  By nature
[4177.48 --> 4179.12]  Do the things
[4179.12 --> 4180.20]  Required by the law
[4180.20 --> 4181.08]  They are a law
[4181.08 --> 4181.82]  Unto themselves
[4181.82 --> 4182.38]  Even though they
[4182.38 --> 4183.14]  Don't have the law
[4183.14 --> 4184.14]  Here this is the
[4184.14 --> 4184.92]  Important part
[4184.92 --> 4186.00]  They show that
[4186.00 --> 4186.58]  The requirements
[4186.58 --> 4187.24]  Of the law
[4187.24 --> 4187.70]  Are written
[4187.70 --> 4188.68]  On their hearts
[4188.68 --> 4189.48]  And their consciences
[4189.48 --> 4190.48]  Also bear witness
[4190.48 --> 4191.20]  In their thoughts
[4191.20 --> 4192.28]  Sometimes accusing them
[4192.28 --> 4193.26]  And at other times
[4193.26 --> 4194.00]  Defending them
[4194.00 --> 4194.90]  Point is
[4194.90 --> 4195.76]  There's something
[4195.76 --> 4197.12]  To this idea
[4197.12 --> 4199.02]  Of having to do good
[4199.02 --> 4201.06]  In order to get good
[4201.06 --> 4202.60]  Or to get the reward
[4202.60 --> 4204.44]  I suggest to you
[4204.44 --> 4205.60]  That this way
[4205.60 --> 4206.82]  Of seeing and being
[4206.82 --> 4207.54]  In the world
[4207.54 --> 4209.28]  Goes all the way back
[4209.28 --> 4210.62]  In biblical theology
[4210.62 --> 4211.56]  To what we call
[4211.56 --> 4212.84]  The covenant of works
[4212.84 --> 4215.06]  Now the covenant of works
[4215.06 --> 4216.64]  That really frames
[4216.64 --> 4218.32]  Or is the relational frame
[4218.32 --> 4219.70]  For how we understand
[4219.70 --> 4221.16]  God's relationship
[4221.16 --> 4221.84]  To humanity
[4221.84 --> 4223.12]  Before the fall
[4223.12 --> 4224.18]  Right before Adam
[4224.18 --> 4224.96]  And Eve's rebellion
[4224.96 --> 4225.92]  In the garden
[4225.92 --> 4228.06]  Right the covenant of works
[4228.06 --> 4230.92]  Exists in relationship
[4230.92 --> 4231.38]  To God
[4231.38 --> 4232.46]  To say this is how
[4232.46 --> 4233.58]  You must be
[4233.58 --> 4234.60]  In the world
[4234.60 --> 4235.88]  Right Adam and Eve
[4235.88 --> 4236.66]  Had to
[4236.66 --> 4238.74]  They were given commands
[4238.74 --> 4239.58]  To do things
[4239.58 --> 4240.38]  And to obey them
[4240.38 --> 4241.02]  To be holy
[4241.02 --> 4242.04]  And to work out
[4242.04 --> 4242.82]  Their relationship
[4242.82 --> 4243.50]  To God
[4243.50 --> 4245.74]  And that first relationship
[4245.74 --> 4247.64]  Was contingent upon
[4247.64 --> 4248.76]  And its continuance
[4248.76 --> 4249.84]  Was contingent upon
[4249.84 --> 4250.88]  Being obedient
[4250.88 --> 4251.72]  On obeying
[4251.72 --> 4253.28]  On doing good
[4253.28 --> 4254.04]  On working
[4254.04 --> 4256.38]  Now obviously
[4256.38 --> 4257.40]  If you have
[4257.40 --> 4258.66]  Opened your Bible
[4258.66 --> 4259.80]  You'll know that
[4259.80 --> 4261.04]  They failed at that
[4261.04 --> 4261.92]  Right
[4261.92 --> 4263.50]  Humanity rebelled
[4263.50 --> 4265.20]  We rebelled
[4265.20 --> 4267.14]  Against this relational frame
[4267.14 --> 4268.44]  This covenant of works
[4268.44 --> 4269.40]  That was part of God's
[4269.40 --> 4270.24]  Design for the world
[4270.24 --> 4271.56]  And we chose otherwise
[4271.56 --> 4274.16]  And so in response
[4274.16 --> 4275.12]  To our rebellion
[4275.12 --> 4276.20]  God begins
[4276.20 --> 4277.04]  Or enters into
[4277.04 --> 4278.62]  A new relational frame
[4278.62 --> 4279.22]  With his people
[4279.22 --> 4279.88]  And we call that
[4279.88 --> 4281.18]  The covenant of grace
[4281.18 --> 4282.94]  And so now
[4282.94 --> 4284.02]  Because of the fall
[4284.02 --> 4285.40]  We relate to God
[4285.40 --> 4286.78]  Through the covenant of grace
[4286.78 --> 4287.80]  Where he keeps
[4287.80 --> 4289.00]  The covenant promises
[4289.00 --> 4290.62]  Where he provides
[4290.62 --> 4291.66]  The obedience
[4291.66 --> 4292.74]  Where he saves
[4292.74 --> 4293.88]  Without merit
[4293.88 --> 4297.98]  Today
[4297.98 --> 4299.78]  We live in
[4299.78 --> 4300.80]  And operate
[4300.80 --> 4302.14]  In this new reality
[4302.14 --> 4303.72]  In this new relationship
[4303.72 --> 4305.20]  And relational frame
[4305.20 --> 4307.18]  This new covenant of grace
[4307.18 --> 4309.28]  And what I'm suggesting
[4309.28 --> 4313.14]  Is that part of the impulse
[4313.14 --> 4314.66]  Part of the religious
[4314.66 --> 4320.14]  And anthropological source
[4320.14 --> 4321.04]  Or root
[4321.04 --> 4323.32]  Of why we continue to believe
[4323.32 --> 4325.02]  And work out of this idea
[4325.02 --> 4326.12]  That doing good
[4326.12 --> 4327.64]  Makes us worthy of reward
[4327.64 --> 4328.44]  Is in fact
[4328.44 --> 4328.46]  Is in fact
[4328.46 --> 4329.76]  A vestige
[4329.76 --> 4331.12]  Of the covenant
[4331.12 --> 4332.04]  Of works
[4332.04 --> 4333.76]  That still persists
[4333.76 --> 4334.78]  In the human psyche
[4334.78 --> 4336.48]  Right
[4336.48 --> 4337.56]  We like rules
[4337.56 --> 4339.10]  Right
[4339.10 --> 4340.08]  Rules make sense
[4340.08 --> 4340.68]  Of the world
[4340.68 --> 4341.98]  They provide
[4341.98 --> 4343.62]  A frame for understanding
[4343.62 --> 4344.90]  And for our functioning
[4344.90 --> 4345.42]  In the world
[4345.42 --> 4346.94]  Rules and laws
[4346.94 --> 4348.16]  And morals
[4348.16 --> 4350.34]  Are also for us
[4350.34 --> 4350.92]  A means
[4350.92 --> 4352.18]  By which we exercise
[4352.18 --> 4352.64]  Control
[4352.64 --> 4353.20]  Control
[4353.20 --> 4354.22]  Over the environments
[4354.22 --> 4355.36]  We find ourselves in
[4355.36 --> 4356.60]  Right
[4356.60 --> 4357.68]  As long as I do this
[4357.68 --> 4358.74]  And don't do that
[4358.74 --> 4359.78]  I'm good
[4359.78 --> 4362.04]  If I just do this
[4362.04 --> 4363.44]  And just do that
[4363.44 --> 4364.36]  I'll be good
[4364.36 --> 4366.84]  And right there
[4366.84 --> 4367.80]  Right
[4367.80 --> 4369.24]  We don't even mean
[4369.24 --> 4370.56]  That we will get heaven
[4370.56 --> 4371.34]  Or have to mean
[4371.34 --> 4372.06]  That we get heaven
[4372.06 --> 4373.08]  Or whatever we want
[4373.08 --> 4373.80]  The idea is that
[4373.80 --> 4375.40]  As long as I'm basically good
[4375.40 --> 4376.28]  Or really
[4376.28 --> 4377.06]  What we mean is
[4377.06 --> 4378.52]  As long as I'm more good
[4378.52 --> 4379.56]  Than I am bad
[4379.56 --> 4381.96]  Good things will come my way
[4381.96 --> 4384.74]  Now here's
[4384.74 --> 4386.36]  Something important
[4386.36 --> 4387.12]  For us to see
[4387.12 --> 4388.22]  Because I think
[4388.22 --> 4389.20]  This is a sort of
[4389.20 --> 4392.40]  I tried really hard
[4392.40 --> 4392.86]  To come up with
[4392.86 --> 4393.30]  A different way
[4393.30 --> 4394.04]  Of expressing this
[4394.04 --> 4395.02]  And apologies
[4395.02 --> 4396.04]  And we can talk after
[4396.04 --> 4397.30]  This is a sort of
[4397.30 --> 4398.46]  Bastardized covenant
[4398.46 --> 4399.02]  Of works
[4399.02 --> 4401.18]  That's what we've done
[4401.18 --> 4402.48]  Where it's not about
[4402.48 --> 4403.34]  Perfection
[4403.34 --> 4405.28]  But it's about effort
[4405.28 --> 4407.34]  Right
[4407.34 --> 4407.94]  Right
[4407.94 --> 4409.94]  You deserve good things
[4409.94 --> 4412.12]  You deserve heaven
[4412.12 --> 4413.58]  You deserve blessing
[4413.58 --> 4414.64]  And in the world today
[4414.64 --> 4415.74]  Because we believe that
[4415.74 --> 4416.96]  We've turned back
[4416.96 --> 4418.10]  The idea of the covenant
[4418.10 --> 4418.54]  Of works
[4418.54 --> 4419.46]  And we've changed
[4419.46 --> 4420.44]  The standard
[4420.44 --> 4421.86]  From absolute perfection
[4421.86 --> 4423.40]  From absolute obedience
[4423.40 --> 4425.06]  From God's holiness
[4425.06 --> 4425.64]  Right
[4425.64 --> 4428.06]  In 1 John 1 verse 5
[4428.06 --> 4428.40]  We read
[4428.40 --> 4429.80]  God is true light
[4429.80 --> 4430.42]  Of true light
[4430.42 --> 4431.36]  In him there is
[4431.36 --> 4433.04]  No darkness at all
[4433.04 --> 4433.78]  Right
[4433.78 --> 4434.66]  In Leviticus
[4434.66 --> 4435.58]  And in 1 Peter
[4435.58 --> 4436.10]  It's repeated
[4436.10 --> 4437.54]  We read that God is
[4437.54 --> 4439.18]  Absolute moral perfection
[4439.18 --> 4439.82]  It says that
[4439.82 --> 4440.76]  God says
[4440.76 --> 4441.66]  Be holy
[4441.66 --> 4443.82]  Because I am holy
[4443.82 --> 4444.68]  In Matthew 5
[4444.68 --> 4445.40]  Jesus says
[4445.40 --> 4446.78]  You must be perfect
[4446.78 --> 4448.20]  As your heavenly father
[4448.20 --> 4449.34]  Is perfect
[4449.34 --> 4450.62]  The standard
[4450.62 --> 4451.36]  Right
[4451.36 --> 4452.20]  In the Bible
[4452.20 --> 4453.22]  Is perfection
[4453.22 --> 4455.74]  But we have changed it
[4455.74 --> 4457.34]  Right
[4457.34 --> 4458.76]  In Psalm 11 7
[4458.76 --> 4459.50]  We read
[4459.50 --> 4460.62]  The Lord is righteous
[4460.62 --> 4461.86]  And he loves
[4461.86 --> 4463.52]  Righteous deeds
[4463.52 --> 4464.96]  And Ezra 9 15
[4464.96 --> 4465.92]  Puts it plainly
[4465.92 --> 4466.64]  And straight forward
[4466.64 --> 4467.80]  Oh Lord God of Israel
[4467.80 --> 4469.12]  You are righteous
[4469.12 --> 4470.50]  No one
[4470.50 --> 4472.38]  Can stand before you
[4472.38 --> 4475.02]  We've changed
[4475.02 --> 4475.80]  The standard
[4475.80 --> 4477.32]  Of absolute perfection
[4477.32 --> 4478.10]  And holiness
[4478.10 --> 4478.98]  To
[4478.98 --> 4480.60]  Just do your best
[4480.60 --> 4482.74]  And it'll be okay
[4482.74 --> 4485.60]  And what we really mean
[4485.60 --> 4486.28]  And I've said it
[4486.28 --> 4486.48]  Right
[4486.48 --> 4488.14]  Is just don't do your worst
[4488.14 --> 4490.08]  Right
[4490.08 --> 4490.94]  We've neutered
[4490.94 --> 4491.94]  The covenant of works
[4491.94 --> 4493.22]  Because like Paul says
[4493.22 --> 4494.48]  Earlier in this letter
[4494.48 --> 4496.14]  We continue to suppress
[4496.14 --> 4497.38]  The truth of God
[4497.38 --> 4498.86]  We continue to exchange
[4498.86 --> 4499.72]  The truth of God
[4499.72 --> 4500.74]  For substitutes
[4500.74 --> 4501.76]  That in the end
[4501.76 --> 4502.98]  Look kind of like
[4502.98 --> 4504.10]  Idealized versions
[4504.10 --> 4504.84]  Of ourselves
[4504.84 --> 4505.84]  And we end
[4505.84 --> 4507.46]  In bowing to temples
[4507.46 --> 4508.30]  Or in the temples
[4508.30 --> 4509.00]  Of Instagram
[4509.00 --> 4510.02]  And TikTok
[4510.02 --> 4511.04]  To the lives
[4511.04 --> 4512.20]  That we wish we had
[4512.20 --> 4513.54]  We listen
[4513.54 --> 4514.24]  At the feet
[4514.24 --> 4515.74]  Of modern prophets
[4515.74 --> 4516.56]  And priests
[4516.56 --> 4517.50]  Of culture
[4517.50 --> 4519.06]  And the contemporary
[4519.06 --> 4519.76]  Zeitgeist
[4519.76 --> 4520.30]  That says
[4520.30 --> 4521.62]  Only what our
[4521.62 --> 4522.48]  Itching ears
[4522.48 --> 4523.14]  Want to hear
[4523.14 --> 4525.74]  In fact
[4525.74 --> 4526.44]  That's exactly
[4526.44 --> 4527.42]  What Paul says
[4527.42 --> 4528.48]  Will happen
[4528.48 --> 4529.30]  When he writes
[4529.30 --> 4530.34]  To Timothy
[4530.34 --> 4532.02]  In the second letter
[4532.02 --> 4533.30]  To Timothy
[4533.30 --> 4534.42]  Paul is writing
[4534.42 --> 4535.58]  To his young
[4535.58 --> 4536.30]  Protégé
[4536.30 --> 4537.12]  Who he has left
[4537.12 --> 4537.68]  In charge
[4537.68 --> 4538.52]  As overseer
[4538.52 --> 4539.44]  Of a group of churches
[4539.44 --> 4541.88]  In the contemporary
[4541.88 --> 4543.24]  And thoroughly
[4543.24 --> 4544.52]  Pagan city
[4544.52 --> 4545.54]  Of Ephesus
[4545.54 --> 4546.94]  And he says
[4546.94 --> 4547.92]  Paul writes to Timothy
[4547.92 --> 4548.32]  He says
[4548.32 --> 4549.78]  A time will come
[4549.78 --> 4550.54]  When people
[4550.54 --> 4552.86]  To suit their own desires
[4552.86 --> 4555.02]  Will gather around them
[4555.02 --> 4556.62]  A great number of teachers
[4556.62 --> 4557.70]  Who say
[4557.70 --> 4559.44]  What their itching ears
[4559.44 --> 4560.68]  Want to hear
[4560.68 --> 4563.18]  Now today
[4563.18 --> 4564.12]  We call that
[4564.12 --> 4565.28]  Confirmation bias
[4565.28 --> 4567.06]  Today we call that
[4567.06 --> 4567.82]  Echo chambers
[4567.82 --> 4569.14]  And today
[4569.14 --> 4569.74]  In fact
[4569.74 --> 4570.40]  I would suggest
[4570.40 --> 4571.84]  It's even more insidious
[4571.84 --> 4572.94]  Because there is
[4572.94 --> 4573.58]  An algorithm
[4573.58 --> 4574.84]  That curates
[4574.84 --> 4577.20]  Your feed
[4577.20 --> 4577.94]  Right
[4577.94 --> 4579.16]  That is capitalizing
[4579.16 --> 4580.78]  On your rage bias
[4580.78 --> 4582.50]  To keep you captivated
[4582.50 --> 4583.22]  And to keep you
[4583.22 --> 4583.94]  Clicking down
[4583.94 --> 4584.94]  That rabbit hole
[4584.94 --> 4585.76]  To confirm
[4585.76 --> 4586.34]  The same thing
[4586.34 --> 4587.12]  That your itching ears
[4587.12 --> 4587.90]  Want to hear
[4587.90 --> 4588.60]  Soon
[4588.60 --> 4589.24]  It happens
[4589.24 --> 4589.96]  That we don't even
[4589.96 --> 4590.92]  Feel our ears
[4590.92 --> 4591.46]  Itching
[4591.46 --> 4592.36]  We just think
[4592.36 --> 4593.08]  Oh this is what it means
[4593.08 --> 4593.58]  To have ears
[4593.58 --> 4596.74]  Now it's interesting
[4596.74 --> 4597.24]  Right
[4597.24 --> 4599.42]  That Paul's response
[4599.42 --> 4601.34]  To Timothy
[4601.34 --> 4602.38]  Paul's charge
[4602.38 --> 4603.34]  To Timothy
[4603.34 --> 4604.08]  In response
[4604.08 --> 4605.34]  To that coming reality
[4605.34 --> 4606.88]  Is precisely
[4606.88 --> 4607.56]  The reason
[4607.56 --> 4608.60]  Why his letter
[4608.60 --> 4609.20]  To the Romans
[4609.20 --> 4610.06]  Is so long
[4610.06 --> 4611.20]  And so comprehensive
[4611.20 --> 4612.80]  It's precisely
[4612.80 --> 4612.82]  It's precisely
[4612.82 --> 4613.32]  The reason
[4613.32 --> 4614.28]  Why our study
[4614.28 --> 4614.70]  Of the book
[4614.70 --> 4615.06]  Of Romans
[4615.06 --> 4616.48]  Is so important
[4616.48 --> 4618.50]  To Timothy
[4618.50 --> 4619.50]  He writes
[4619.50 --> 4621.92]  Preach the word
[4621.92 --> 4623.54]  Be prepared
[4623.54 --> 4624.30]  In season
[4624.30 --> 4625.70]  And out of season
[4625.70 --> 4626.22]  Correct
[4626.22 --> 4626.68]  Rebuke
[4626.68 --> 4627.26]  And encourage
[4627.26 --> 4628.46]  With great patience
[4628.46 --> 4630.14]  And careful instruction
[4630.14 --> 4631.96]  And he says
[4631.96 --> 4632.76]  In response
[4632.76 --> 4634.14]  To the itching ear
[4634.14 --> 4634.58]  Teaching
[4634.58 --> 4635.70]  That we need
[4635.70 --> 4636.48]  Sound
[4636.48 --> 4637.50]  Doctrine
[4637.50 --> 4640.36]  That's Paul's words
[4640.36 --> 4640.86]  That we need
[4640.86 --> 4642.00]  Sound doctrine
[4642.00 --> 4643.36]  Right
[4643.36 --> 4644.90]  It is good theology
[4644.90 --> 4646.30]  That will help us
[4646.30 --> 4647.46]  In this crazy world
[4647.46 --> 4650.42]  And so
[4650.42 --> 4651.66]  To someone who says
[4651.66 --> 4653.60]  Oh I'm not that bad
[4653.60 --> 4655.24]  Or to someone who says
[4655.24 --> 4656.68]  I'll do good things
[4656.68 --> 4657.70]  That's good enough
[4657.70 --> 4659.24]  Right
[4659.24 --> 4660.38]  To someone who's
[4660.38 --> 4663.30]  Over and over
[4663.30 --> 4664.70]  Banging their morality
[4664.70 --> 4665.98]  Trying to accomplish
[4665.98 --> 4666.66]  Something
[4666.66 --> 4667.78]  Paul brings
[4667.78 --> 4668.68]  Clarity
[4668.68 --> 4670.98]  Look at verse 6
[4670.98 --> 4673.22]  It says
[4673.22 --> 4674.22]  God will repay
[4674.22 --> 4675.16]  Each person
[4675.16 --> 4676.64]  According to what
[4676.64 --> 4678.88]  They have done
[4678.88 --> 4681.88]  Psalm 139
[4681.88 --> 4682.54]  Is a favorite
[4682.54 --> 4683.96]  To probably
[4683.96 --> 4684.88]  Many of you
[4684.88 --> 4686.28]  And it says
[4686.28 --> 4687.64]  You have searched me
[4687.64 --> 4687.96]  Lord
[4687.96 --> 4689.42]  And you know me
[4689.42 --> 4691.80]  You know when I sit
[4691.80 --> 4692.70]  And when I rise
[4692.70 --> 4694.44]  You perceive my thoughts
[4694.44 --> 4695.24]  From afar
[4695.24 --> 4696.44]  Even if I hide
[4696.44 --> 4697.10]  In the dark
[4697.10 --> 4698.32]  Darkness isn't dark
[4698.32 --> 4698.80]  To you
[4698.80 --> 4700.28]  Night is like day
[4700.28 --> 4701.82]  Darkness is light
[4701.82 --> 4702.60]  To you
[4702.60 --> 4703.24]  Point is
[4703.24 --> 4704.34]  God sees
[4704.34 --> 4705.36]  Everything
[4705.36 --> 4707.32]  Nothing you do
[4707.32 --> 4707.98]  Or think
[4707.98 --> 4708.64]  Or feel
[4708.64 --> 4709.30]  Is hidden
[4709.30 --> 4710.24]  From him
[4710.24 --> 4715.68]  And so yes
[4715.68 --> 4716.48]  It is true
[4716.48 --> 4718.18]  Like verse 7
[4718.18 --> 4718.68]  Says
[4718.68 --> 4720.12]  And verse 10
[4720.12 --> 4720.40]  Right
[4720.40 --> 4721.14]  That those who
[4721.14 --> 4722.46]  Persist in doing
[4722.46 --> 4722.86]  Good
[4722.86 --> 4723.92]  Who seek glory
[4723.92 --> 4724.52]  And honor
[4724.52 --> 4726.32]  And immortality
[4726.32 --> 4727.46]  He will give you
[4727.46 --> 4728.22]  Eternal life
[4728.22 --> 4729.78]  But that word
[4729.78 --> 4730.94]  Persistence
[4730.94 --> 4731.76]  Is really
[4731.76 --> 4732.58]  Important
[4732.58 --> 4733.30]  Because it means
[4733.30 --> 4734.38]  Consistence
[4734.38 --> 4735.34]  It means those
[4735.34 --> 4736.40]  Who are consistently
[4736.40 --> 4737.36]  Always
[4737.36 --> 4738.16]  Only
[4738.16 --> 4739.56]  Doing good works
[4739.56 --> 4740.66]  Right
[4740.66 --> 4741.54]  We read Jesus
[4741.54 --> 4742.92]  Be perfect
[4742.92 --> 4743.58]  Like God
[4743.58 --> 4744.30]  Is perfect
[4744.30 --> 4744.62]  Right
[4744.62 --> 4745.10]  Always
[4745.10 --> 4745.58]  Only
[4745.58 --> 4746.34]  Seek first
[4746.34 --> 4746.96]  His kingdom
[4746.96 --> 4748.16]  And his righteousness
[4748.16 --> 4749.16]  Do that
[4749.16 --> 4750.72]  And you will
[4750.72 --> 4751.74]  Have eternal life
[4751.74 --> 4753.26]  Right
[4753.26 --> 4753.66]  That's back
[4753.66 --> 4754.18]  To the covenant
[4754.18 --> 4754.72]  Of works
[4754.72 --> 4755.94]  And if you
[4755.94 --> 4756.72]  Can't do
[4756.72 --> 4757.28]  That
[4757.28 --> 4759.24]  Verse 8
[4759.24 --> 4761.40]  For those
[4761.40 --> 4762.36]  Who are self-seeking
[4762.36 --> 4763.34]  Who reject the truth
[4763.34 --> 4764.22]  And who follow evil
[4764.22 --> 4765.28]  There will be wrath
[4765.28 --> 4766.78]  And anger
[4766.78 --> 4769.34]  There will be
[4769.34 --> 4771.66]  Trouble
[4771.66 --> 4772.84]  And distress
[4772.84 --> 4774.38]  For every human being
[4774.38 --> 4775.88]  Who does evil
[4775.88 --> 4778.32]  See there's no
[4778.32 --> 4779.22]  Half measures
[4779.22 --> 4780.36]  Here
[4780.36 --> 4781.14]  There's no
[4781.14 --> 4781.78]  In between
[4781.78 --> 4783.14]  There's no
[4783.14 --> 4784.04]  Good enough
[4784.04 --> 4785.74]  It's perfection
[4785.74 --> 4786.96]  Or bust
[4786.96 --> 4789.16]  Perfectly good
[4789.16 --> 4790.32]  Perfectly righteous
[4790.32 --> 4791.48]  Perfectly holy
[4791.48 --> 4792.78]  Or it's just
[4792.78 --> 4793.86]  Not good enough
[4793.86 --> 4795.92]  And I'm sorry
[4795.92 --> 4796.40]  If this
[4796.40 --> 4797.36]  Offends you
[4797.36 --> 4799.58]  But it doesn't
[4799.58 --> 4800.28]  Matter who you
[4800.28 --> 4801.08]  Think you are
[4801.08 --> 4802.14]  It doesn't matter
[4802.14 --> 4802.80]  How good you
[4802.80 --> 4803.40]  Think you are
[4803.40 --> 4803.74]  Paul says
[4803.74 --> 4804.52]  You therefore
[4804.52 --> 4805.64]  Have no excuse
[4805.64 --> 4806.76]  You who pass
[4806.76 --> 4807.90]  Judgment on someone
[4807.90 --> 4809.04]  You are condemning
[4809.04 --> 4809.74]  Yourself because
[4809.74 --> 4810.60]  You do the same
[4810.60 --> 4810.98]  Things
[4810.98 --> 4812.02]  And so in context
[4812.02 --> 4813.04]  It doesn't matter
[4813.04 --> 4813.72]  If you are a
[4813.72 --> 4814.46]  Roman citizen
[4814.46 --> 4815.40]  The literal
[4815.40 --> 4816.66]  Rulers and leaders
[4816.66 --> 4817.70]  Of the world
[4817.70 --> 4819.20]  It doesn't matter
[4819.20 --> 4819.60]  If you are
[4819.60 --> 4820.72]  Trying your best
[4820.72 --> 4821.80]  It doesn't matter
[4821.80 --> 4822.76]  If you are
[4822.76 --> 4823.40]  The nicest
[4823.40 --> 4824.48]  Most moral
[4824.48 --> 4825.46]  Person you know
[4825.46 --> 4826.38]  It doesn't even
[4826.38 --> 4827.28]  Matter Paul says
[4827.28 --> 4827.82]  If you are
[4827.82 --> 4828.66]  Jewish and have
[4828.66 --> 4829.20]  The law and
[4829.20 --> 4829.60]  The promise
[4829.60 --> 4830.18]  Of Abraham
[4830.18 --> 4831.34]  That's verse
[4831.34 --> 4831.74]  Nine
[4831.74 --> 4834.72]  There will be
[4834.72 --> 4835.34]  Trouble and distress
[4835.34 --> 4836.02]  For every human
[4836.02 --> 4836.60]  Being who does
[4836.60 --> 4837.20]  Evil first
[4837.20 --> 4837.80]  For the Jew
[4837.80 --> 4839.64]  Then for the
[4839.64 --> 4840.18]  Gentile
[4840.18 --> 4842.72]  So first thing
[4842.72 --> 4843.64]  Before we dig
[4843.64 --> 4844.26]  Into that verse
[4844.26 --> 4845.76]  Remember that
[4845.76 --> 4846.72]  Paul himself
[4846.72 --> 4847.60]  Is a Roman
[4847.60 --> 4848.06]  Citizen
[4848.06 --> 4849.24]  And a Jew
[4849.24 --> 4851.24]  He is not
[4851.24 --> 4852.26]  Only just a Jew
[4852.26 --> 4854.18]  He is a Pharisee
[4854.18 --> 4855.00]  Which means
[4855.00 --> 4856.54]  In that prescribed
[4856.54 --> 4857.76]  Reality and the way
[4857.76 --> 4858.70]  Of world that is
[4858.70 --> 4859.02]  Function
[4859.02 --> 4860.16]  That when he says
[4860.16 --> 4860.90]  In Philippians 3
[4860.90 --> 4861.38]  For instance
[4861.38 --> 4862.42]  That he is
[4862.42 --> 4863.42]  Blameless when it
[4863.42 --> 4864.18]  Comes to the law
[4864.18 --> 4865.02]  He means it
[4865.02 --> 4866.06]  He's not wrong
[4866.06 --> 4868.18]  But likewise
[4868.18 --> 4868.98]  In Philippians 3
[4868.98 --> 4869.90]  He also says
[4869.90 --> 4870.68]  That none of that
[4870.68 --> 4871.22]  Matters
[4871.22 --> 4873.18]  That's not enough
[4873.18 --> 4873.70]  None of that
[4873.70 --> 4875.04]  Helps him here
[4875.04 --> 4875.46]  Right
[4875.46 --> 4876.16]  If anyone
[4876.16 --> 4876.84]  Had a reason
[4876.84 --> 4877.66]  To be confident
[4877.66 --> 4878.72]  In their status
[4878.72 --> 4879.74]  Roman citizen
[4879.74 --> 4880.34]  Jew
[4880.34 --> 4881.20]  Pharisee
[4881.20 --> 4881.90]  It was Paul
[4881.90 --> 4883.02]  But even Paul
[4883.02 --> 4884.40]  Can't and doesn't
[4884.40 --> 4885.40]  And so
[4885.40 --> 4888.30]  Why do I think
[4888.30 --> 4889.72]  That I can
[4889.72 --> 4893.74]  Paul uses a phrase
[4893.74 --> 4895.32]  Here twice
[4895.32 --> 4896.26]  And he also used it
[4896.26 --> 4897.28]  In chapter 1
[4897.28 --> 4898.04]  Verse 16
[4898.04 --> 4898.50]  We'll read it
[4898.50 --> 4899.24]  From chapter 1
[4899.24 --> 4899.82]  16
[4899.82 --> 4900.16]  He says
[4900.16 --> 4901.16]  For I am not ashamed
[4901.16 --> 4901.68]  Of the gospel
[4901.68 --> 4902.64]  Because it is the power
[4902.64 --> 4903.78]  Of God that brings salvation
[4903.78 --> 4904.96]  To everyone who believes
[4904.96 --> 4906.78]  First to the Jew
[4906.78 --> 4908.22]  Then to the Gentile
[4908.22 --> 4909.92]  That's the phrase
[4909.92 --> 4910.80]  First to the Jew
[4910.80 --> 4912.16]  Then to the Gentile
[4912.16 --> 4914.00]  In both cases
[4914.00 --> 4915.00]  That phrase
[4915.00 --> 4915.96]  Is about two things
[4915.96 --> 4917.24]  It's about order
[4917.24 --> 4918.92]  And inclusion
[4918.92 --> 4921.84]  So in the case of order
[4921.84 --> 4923.54]  It's Jesus was a Jew
[4923.54 --> 4925.30]  God chose Israel
[4925.30 --> 4926.40]  As his people
[4926.40 --> 4927.54]  Through whom
[4927.54 --> 4928.90]  To bless the world
[4928.90 --> 4929.58]  That's the promise
[4929.58 --> 4929.96]  Of God
[4929.96 --> 4930.76]  To Abraham
[4930.76 --> 4931.62]  Right
[4931.62 --> 4932.72]  The gospel came
[4932.72 --> 4933.84]  First to the Jews
[4933.84 --> 4935.20]  But was always intended
[4935.20 --> 4936.72]  For the rest of the world
[4936.72 --> 4937.96]  For Gentiles
[4937.96 --> 4939.04]  The word Gentile
[4939.04 --> 4940.64]  Means non-Jew
[4940.64 --> 4942.00]  And the word
[4942.00 --> 4943.02]  Actually in Greek
[4943.02 --> 4944.72]  The Paul's letters
[4944.72 --> 4945.50]  Were originally written
[4945.50 --> 4946.00]  In Greek
[4946.00 --> 4946.50]  And the word
[4946.50 --> 4947.26]  That is used here
[4947.26 --> 4947.92]  That our Bibles
[4947.92 --> 4949.52]  Translate Gentile
[4949.52 --> 4950.50]  Is actually the word
[4950.50 --> 4951.16]  Halani
[4951.16 --> 4952.98]  Which is the Greek word
[4952.98 --> 4954.50]  For the Greek people
[4954.50 --> 4955.92]  Right
[4955.92 --> 4956.84]  Or people who have
[4956.84 --> 4958.98]  Adopted and been included
[4958.98 --> 4960.74]  In the Greek religion
[4960.74 --> 4962.16]  And geopolitical
[4962.16 --> 4963.30]  Social culture
[4963.30 --> 4964.46]  Because of the empire
[4964.46 --> 4965.92]  Sometimes you may have heard
[4965.92 --> 4967.58]  Of the Hellenistic era
[4967.58 --> 4968.44]  Right
[4968.44 --> 4969.42]  That's the root there
[4969.42 --> 4971.36]  But it's also
[4971.36 --> 4972.48]  Not just about order
[4972.48 --> 4974.12]  It's about inclusion
[4974.12 --> 4975.44]  That is to say
[4975.44 --> 4976.52]  It cuts both ways
[4976.52 --> 4976.72]  Right
[4976.72 --> 4978.76]  The gospel is for Gentiles
[4978.76 --> 4979.96]  And that the gospel
[4979.96 --> 4980.82]  Is for Gentiles
[4980.82 --> 4981.92]  Would be offensive
[4981.92 --> 4983.34]  To the Jews
[4983.34 --> 4986.70]  But also
[4986.70 --> 4988.90]  As the primary
[4988.90 --> 4989.94]  Audience
[4989.94 --> 4991.20]  Or the first readers
[4991.20 --> 4992.18]  Of the Christians
[4992.18 --> 4992.72]  In Rome
[4992.72 --> 4993.56]  Were probably
[4993.56 --> 4994.86]  Most of them
[4994.86 --> 4996.02]  Jewish converts
[4996.02 --> 4996.84]  To Christianity
[4996.84 --> 4998.72]  So Paul's primary audience
[4998.72 --> 4999.66]  Would be a group
[4999.66 --> 5000.88]  Of people who grew up
[5000.88 --> 5001.18]  Jewish
[5001.18 --> 5001.78]  And are now
[5001.78 --> 5003.28]  Practicing Christians
[5003.28 --> 5005.10]  Right
[5005.10 --> 5006.08]  They would have read
[5006.08 --> 5007.06]  And heard
[5007.06 --> 5008.46]  As it was read to them
[5008.46 --> 5009.14]  The first
[5009.14 --> 5010.90]  All of chapter 1
[5010.90 --> 5012.06]  Right
[5012.06 --> 5012.68]  Where Paul says
[5012.68 --> 5013.46]  Everything that he says
[5013.46 --> 5014.64]  About sinful humanity
[5014.64 --> 5016.44]  And in their own minds
[5016.44 --> 5017.44]  They would have heard that
[5017.44 --> 5019.56]  And excluded themselves
[5019.56 --> 5022.70]  So they would read
[5022.70 --> 5024.34]  The last part of chapter 1
[5024.34 --> 5025.88]  As these Jewish Christians
[5025.88 --> 5026.50]  And they would think
[5026.50 --> 5026.94]  Yes
[5026.94 --> 5027.86]  You know what Paul
[5027.86 --> 5029.20]  Those pagans
[5029.20 --> 5030.86]  Do suppress the truth of God
[5030.86 --> 5031.98]  Those pagans
[5031.98 --> 5033.26]  Do live in wickedness
[5033.26 --> 5034.24]  Those pagans
[5034.24 --> 5035.40]  Really are godless
[5035.40 --> 5037.14]  They would have heard
[5037.14 --> 5037.82]  What Paul said
[5037.82 --> 5038.18]  And they go
[5038.18 --> 5038.64]  Yeah
[5038.64 --> 5040.24]  Absolutely Paul
[5040.24 --> 5041.68]  Those pagans
[5041.68 --> 5042.28]  Over there
[5042.28 --> 5043.18]  They give themselves
[5043.18 --> 5044.42]  Over to sinful desires
[5044.42 --> 5045.96]  And to sexual immorality
[5045.96 --> 5046.68]  Those pagans
[5046.68 --> 5047.56]  Give themselves over
[5047.56 --> 5048.60]  To a depraved mind
[5048.60 --> 5050.26]  And every kind of wickedness
[5050.26 --> 5050.98]  Evil greed
[5050.98 --> 5051.78]  And depravity
[5051.78 --> 5053.44]  They would have heard that
[5053.44 --> 5053.88]  And they would have
[5053.88 --> 5055.16]  Excluded themselves
[5055.16 --> 5056.66]  As the target
[5056.66 --> 5058.86]  What Paul does here
[5058.86 --> 5059.36]  In chapter 2
[5059.36 --> 5060.18]  Is make sure to
[5060.18 --> 5061.08]  Include them
[5061.08 --> 5062.74]  As the target
[5062.74 --> 5065.40]  Part of what we have
[5065.40 --> 5066.30]  Been saying this morning
[5066.30 --> 5067.46]  Is that
[5067.46 --> 5068.58]  Paul's point
[5068.58 --> 5070.18]  Is that religious people
[5070.18 --> 5071.18]  And now the target
[5071.18 --> 5072.06]  Broadens to include
[5072.06 --> 5072.50]  You and me
[5072.50 --> 5074.58]  Religious people
[5074.58 --> 5075.92]  Sometimes think
[5075.92 --> 5077.58]  That we're better
[5077.58 --> 5082.24]  But the fact
[5082.24 --> 5083.64]  Is that
[5083.64 --> 5084.24]  The trouble
[5084.24 --> 5085.94]  And distress
[5085.94 --> 5087.28]  For those
[5087.28 --> 5087.90]  Who know
[5087.90 --> 5088.56]  The law
[5088.56 --> 5090.84]  Will be worse
[5090.84 --> 5092.58]  And it will be first
[5092.58 --> 5093.76]  Right
[5093.76 --> 5094.30]  That's why
[5094.30 --> 5095.22]  There's no excuse
[5095.22 --> 5095.58]  Because
[5095.58 --> 5097.52]  We do the same thing
[5097.52 --> 5099.06]  That's why
[5099.06 --> 5099.64]  There's no excuse
[5099.64 --> 5099.92]  Because
[5099.92 --> 5100.76]  Verse 12
[5100.76 --> 5101.82]  All who sin
[5101.82 --> 5102.78]  Apart from the law
[5102.78 --> 5103.48]  Will also perish
[5103.48 --> 5104.20]  Apart from the law
[5104.20 --> 5104.86]  And all who sin
[5104.86 --> 5105.52]  Under the law
[5105.52 --> 5106.22]  Will be judged
[5106.22 --> 5107.42]  By the law
[5107.42 --> 5109.08]  Right
[5109.08 --> 5109.98]  It turns out
[5109.98 --> 5111.30]  It's a dangerous
[5111.30 --> 5112.66]  Thing to know the law
[5112.66 --> 5115.94]  One writer says
[5115.94 --> 5117.30]  That chapter 2
[5117.30 --> 5118.36]  Is like a bucket
[5118.36 --> 5119.54]  Of cold water
[5119.54 --> 5121.06]  To the religious person
[5121.06 --> 5122.18]  Right
[5122.18 --> 5122.84]  It's a shock
[5122.84 --> 5123.50]  To the system
[5123.50 --> 5125.70]  A bucket of ice water
[5125.70 --> 5126.66]  Thrown in your face
[5126.66 --> 5127.30]  When you've been saying
[5127.30 --> 5127.92]  Yeah them
[5127.92 --> 5128.80]  Yeah them
[5128.80 --> 5129.60]  Yeah them
[5129.60 --> 5132.26]  You
[5132.26 --> 5134.36]  Me
[5134.36 --> 5137.60]  It's the same
[5137.60 --> 5138.22]  For us
[5138.22 --> 5139.50]  Who are religious
[5139.50 --> 5140.64]  Moralists today
[5140.64 --> 5141.28]  It's the same
[5141.28 --> 5141.88]  For those who
[5141.88 --> 5143.24]  Believe in the ogre
[5143.24 --> 5143.90]  Frame
[5143.90 --> 5144.52]  The universal
[5144.52 --> 5145.30]  Gnostic religious
[5145.30 --> 5145.98]  Ethic
[5145.98 --> 5147.18]  For anyone who says
[5147.18 --> 5148.62]  Just try to be good
[5148.62 --> 5151.56]  Just try not to be too bad
[5151.56 --> 5153.60]  It's not enough
[5153.60 --> 5156.50]  It's never going to be
[5156.50 --> 5157.44]  Enough
[5157.44 --> 5161.80]  Covenant of works
[5161.80 --> 5163.72]  And our failure
[5163.72 --> 5165.50]  And the law
[5165.50 --> 5167.90]  And our conscience
[5167.90 --> 5170.42]  They all condemn us
[5170.42 --> 5173.00]  And our morality
[5173.00 --> 5174.76]  Our religiosity
[5174.76 --> 5175.90]  Our privilege
[5175.90 --> 5176.70]  Whatever form
[5176.70 --> 5177.70]  That takes
[5177.70 --> 5179.44]  Doesn't help us
[5179.44 --> 5184.66]  Verse 4
[5184.66 --> 5188.16]  But God's kindness
[5188.16 --> 5190.42]  Is intended
[5190.42 --> 5191.74]  To lead you
[5191.74 --> 5193.04]  To repentance
[5193.04 --> 5196.42]  That's what we need
[5196.42 --> 5197.10]  Right now
[5197.10 --> 5198.14]  Right
[5198.14 --> 5199.38]  Repentant hearts
[5199.38 --> 5200.58]  The realization
[5200.58 --> 5201.58]  This morning
[5201.58 --> 5202.28]  That nothing
[5202.28 --> 5203.12]  I do
[5203.12 --> 5204.02]  Is enough
[5204.02 --> 5204.86]  Because nothing
[5204.86 --> 5205.58]  I do
[5205.58 --> 5206.78]  Is perfectly
[5206.78 --> 5207.62]  Perfect
[5207.62 --> 5210.46]  But there is one
[5210.46 --> 5211.42]  Who has come
[5211.42 --> 5213.24]  Right
[5213.24 --> 5214.28]  There is one
[5214.28 --> 5215.86]  Who knew no sin
[5215.86 --> 5217.46]  But became
[5217.46 --> 5218.26]  Sin
[5218.26 --> 5219.34]  For us
[5219.34 --> 5220.74]  That we might become
[5220.74 --> 5221.36]  The righteousness
[5221.36 --> 5222.24]  Of God
[5222.24 --> 5223.34]  We failed
[5223.34 --> 5224.56]  Right
[5224.56 --> 5225.10]  We failed
[5225.10 --> 5225.84]  In the covenant
[5225.84 --> 5226.44]  Of works
[5226.44 --> 5227.28]  And then
[5227.28 --> 5228.42]  We try to change
[5228.42 --> 5229.34]  The covenant of works
[5229.34 --> 5229.92]  Into something
[5229.92 --> 5230.86]  That is lesser
[5230.86 --> 5231.52]  Than
[5231.52 --> 5232.78]  But God
[5232.78 --> 5234.30]  Even in our failure
[5234.30 --> 5234.90]  God
[5234.90 --> 5236.00]  Gives the covenant
[5236.00 --> 5237.40]  Of grace
[5237.40 --> 5238.32]  God comes
[5238.32 --> 5239.42]  In Jesus Christ
[5239.42 --> 5240.66]  To live the life
[5240.66 --> 5241.58]  That we should have lived
[5241.58 --> 5242.96]  And to die the death
[5242.96 --> 5243.76]  That we deserve
[5243.76 --> 5245.24]  As the wrath of God
[5245.24 --> 5246.10]  For our sin
[5246.10 --> 5246.94]  And now
[5246.94 --> 5247.66]  A righteousness
[5247.66 --> 5248.34]  From God
[5248.34 --> 5249.92]  Has been made available
[5249.92 --> 5251.52]  Apart from the law
[5251.52 --> 5252.20]  A righteousness
[5252.20 --> 5253.36]  That is by grace
[5253.36 --> 5255.00]  Through faith
[5255.00 --> 5257.22]  That
[5257.22 --> 5258.52]  Is what
[5258.52 --> 5259.20]  We need
[5259.20 --> 5259.94]  That is what
[5259.94 --> 5261.24]  I hope you hear
[5261.24 --> 5261.82]  From me
[5261.82 --> 5262.36]  Week in
[5262.36 --> 5262.96]  And week out
[5262.96 --> 5265.26]  That is the sound doctrine
[5265.26 --> 5266.66]  The pure preaching
[5266.66 --> 5267.68]  Of the gospel
[5267.68 --> 5268.72]  That our generation
[5268.72 --> 5269.88]  So desperately
[5269.88 --> 5271.10]  Needs to hear
[5271.10 --> 5274.68]  It is the hard truth
[5274.68 --> 5277.04]  Of our total inability
[5277.04 --> 5279.40]  Of human depravity
[5279.40 --> 5280.42]  Because it is only
[5280.42 --> 5281.62]  When we understand
[5281.62 --> 5283.00]  That we are absolutely
[5283.00 --> 5284.32]  Unable
[5284.32 --> 5285.94]  Do we begin to understand
[5285.94 --> 5286.48]  God
[5286.48 --> 5287.40]  Who has done
[5287.40 --> 5288.36]  Everything
[5288.36 --> 5291.34]  And instead of trying
[5291.34 --> 5292.30]  To the point
[5292.30 --> 5293.14]  Of depression
[5293.14 --> 5294.42]  And anxiety
[5294.42 --> 5295.46]  Instead of
[5295.46 --> 5297.42]  Casting social shame
[5297.42 --> 5298.44]  And canceling
[5298.44 --> 5299.80]  Those around us
[5299.80 --> 5300.72]  Who don't meet
[5300.72 --> 5301.74]  Our standard
[5301.74 --> 5303.20]  Or some standard
[5303.20 --> 5303.60]  Right
[5303.60 --> 5304.46]  We can turn
[5304.46 --> 5305.16]  To the grace
[5305.16 --> 5305.94]  Of God
[5305.94 --> 5306.66]  Together
[5306.66 --> 5307.88]  We can turn
[5307.88 --> 5309.20]  To this truth
[5309.20 --> 5310.34]  Which is the great
[5310.34 --> 5311.48]  Equalizer
[5311.48 --> 5312.54]  All of us
[5312.54 --> 5313.38]  The same
[5313.38 --> 5314.74]  Stand in need
[5314.74 --> 5315.60]  Of the grace
[5315.60 --> 5316.46]  Of God
[5316.46 --> 5319.46]  And so
[5319.46 --> 5321.82]  If you are
[5321.82 --> 5322.90]  A Christian
[5322.90 --> 5324.52]  Who has received
[5324.52 --> 5325.16]  The grace
[5325.16 --> 5325.74]  Of God
[5325.74 --> 5326.24]  This morning
[5326.24 --> 5327.18]  Or if you are
[5327.18 --> 5327.74]  Hungry
[5327.74 --> 5328.40]  And your soul
[5328.40 --> 5329.30]  Is crying out
[5329.30 --> 5330.12]  For the grace
[5330.12 --> 5330.54]  Of God
[5330.54 --> 5330.94]  This morning
[5330.94 --> 5332.32]  He is here
[5332.32 --> 5333.10]  And he
[5333.10 --> 5334.58]  Has life
[5334.58 --> 5335.56]  For you
[5335.56 --> 5338.12]  And if you have
[5338.12 --> 5339.36]  Received that grace
[5339.36 --> 5340.72]  How much
[5340.72 --> 5341.46]  More
[5341.46 --> 5343.02]  Understanding
[5343.02 --> 5344.42]  Should you have
[5344.42 --> 5345.08]  In this life
[5345.08 --> 5346.52]  How much more
[5346.52 --> 5347.88]  Understanding of the world
[5347.88 --> 5348.50]  And the way things
[5348.50 --> 5348.98]  Are working
[5348.98 --> 5349.94]  Or not working
[5349.94 --> 5351.36]  Or the brokenness
[5351.36 --> 5351.84]  That we face
[5351.84 --> 5352.90]  Should you have
[5352.90 --> 5353.84]  In this life
[5353.84 --> 5354.70]  How much more
[5354.70 --> 5355.52]  Humility
[5355.52 --> 5356.88]  Should we have
[5356.88 --> 5357.58]  As Christians
[5357.58 --> 5358.70]  In response
[5358.70 --> 5360.18]  To this brokenness
[5360.18 --> 5361.32]  And this heartbreak
[5361.32 --> 5362.32]  To this feeble
[5362.32 --> 5362.78]  Attempt
[5362.78 --> 5363.40]  And failure
[5363.40 --> 5364.40]  How much more
[5364.40 --> 5365.00]  Gentleness
[5365.00 --> 5366.20]  And respect
[5366.20 --> 5367.10]  Should we have
[5367.10 --> 5367.88]  For those people
[5367.88 --> 5368.20]  Who are
[5368.20 --> 5370.20]  Stuck in sin
[5370.20 --> 5371.78]  For those who are
[5371.78 --> 5372.62]  Trapped in this
[5372.62 --> 5373.28]  Wrong way
[5373.28 --> 5374.06]  Of seeing
[5374.06 --> 5374.76]  And being
[5374.76 --> 5375.62]  In the world
[5375.62 --> 5379.92]  And as I say that
[5379.92 --> 5380.82]  Many of you
[5380.82 --> 5381.18]  Are thinking
[5381.18 --> 5381.94]  Yes pastor
[5381.94 --> 5383.00]  Yes we should
[5383.00 --> 5383.40]  Have that
[5383.40 --> 5384.02]  We should be
[5384.02 --> 5384.40]  That way
[5384.40 --> 5385.36]  But let me ask you
[5385.36 --> 5386.36]  Are we known
[5386.36 --> 5387.64]  As that
[5387.64 --> 5390.62]  Are we known
[5390.62 --> 5391.82]  As those who are
[5391.82 --> 5392.74]  Full of gentleness
[5392.74 --> 5393.86]  And respect
[5393.86 --> 5395.42]  Is that what you
[5395.42 --> 5396.32]  Are known for
[5396.32 --> 5397.48]  In your office
[5397.48 --> 5399.58]  Is that what you
[5399.58 --> 5400.46]  Are known for
[5400.46 --> 5401.00]  As a person
[5401.00 --> 5401.76]  Of humility
[5401.76 --> 5402.66]  Who anyone
[5402.66 --> 5403.56]  Can come up to
[5403.56 --> 5404.86]  At school
[5404.86 --> 5407.34]  Is that what you
[5407.34 --> 5408.32]  Are known for
[5408.32 --> 5410.66]  When you play
[5410.66 --> 5411.64]  Hockey
[5411.64 --> 5413.14]  On Saturday nights
[5413.14 --> 5415.06]  Or soccer
[5415.06 --> 5416.56]  On Saturday morning
[5416.56 --> 5419.60]  Is that what you
[5419.60 --> 5421.40]  Are known for
[5421.40 --> 5423.18]  When you know
[5423.18 --> 5423.68]  Grace
[5423.68 --> 5425.48]  When you know
[5425.48 --> 5426.08]  This Jesus
[5426.08 --> 5428.26]  Came into the world
[5428.26 --> 5428.68]  For you
[5428.68 --> 5431.60]  Paul says
[5431.60 --> 5432.18]  We need
[5432.18 --> 5434.02]  Sound doctrine
[5434.02 --> 5435.06]  To combat
[5435.06 --> 5436.50]  What itching ears
[5436.50 --> 5437.30]  Want to hear
[5437.30 --> 5439.44]  And it is sound
[5439.44 --> 5440.06]  Doctrine
[5440.06 --> 5440.46]  That will
[5440.46 --> 5442.06]  Transform our
[5442.06 --> 5443.48]  Hearts and minds
[5443.48 --> 5444.14]  And lives
[5444.14 --> 5445.28]  It is sound doctrine
[5445.28 --> 5445.62]  That will
[5445.62 --> 5446.98]  Form a faith
[5446.98 --> 5447.60]  In us
[5447.60 --> 5448.64]  That makes us
[5448.64 --> 5449.80]  More like
[5449.80 --> 5450.52]  Jesus
[5450.52 --> 5451.70]  In the world
[5451.70 --> 5453.10]  And so
[5453.10 --> 5454.16]  As you go
[5454.16 --> 5454.98]  Wrestle with
[5454.98 --> 5456.04]  That question
[5456.04 --> 5457.36]  How am I
[5457.36 --> 5458.20]  Known
[5458.20 --> 5459.30]  But also
[5459.30 --> 5461.14]  Ask yourself
[5461.14 --> 5462.24]  How will I
[5462.24 --> 5462.90]  Grow
[5462.90 --> 5464.94]  How will I
[5464.94 --> 5465.70]  Be transformed
[5465.70 --> 5466.64]  Into the image
[5466.64 --> 5466.92]  Of Jesus
[5466.92 --> 5467.74]  What am I doing
[5467.74 --> 5468.64]  To dig deep
[5468.64 --> 5469.88]  Into God's word
[5469.88 --> 5470.56]  To be shaped
[5470.56 --> 5471.66]  By sound doctrine
[5471.66 --> 5472.80]  Are you in a bible study
[5472.80 --> 5474.70]  Are you doing
[5474.70 --> 5476.00]  Your devotions
[5476.00 --> 5476.80]  Personally
[5476.80 --> 5478.16]  And corporately
[5478.16 --> 5479.88]  Are you signing up
[5479.88 --> 5481.70]  For adult education
[5481.70 --> 5482.52]  Classes
[5482.52 --> 5483.44]  Right
[5483.44 --> 5483.96]  And in
[5483.96 --> 5485.30]  A couple weeks
[5485.30 --> 5486.10]  I'm going to be running
[5486.10 --> 5486.74]  A Christianity
[5486.74 --> 5488.12]  Explored class
[5488.12 --> 5488.38]  Here
[5488.38 --> 5489.04]  And that class
[5489.04 --> 5489.60]  Is targeted
[5489.60 --> 5490.52]  Primarily for people
[5490.52 --> 5491.50]  Who are new to faith
[5491.50 --> 5492.72]  Or who are returning
[5492.72 --> 5493.24]  To faith
[5493.24 --> 5494.44]  After a long time away
[5494.44 --> 5495.60]  Right
[5495.60 --> 5496.24]  If that's something
[5496.24 --> 5497.36]  Where you are interested in
[5497.36 --> 5497.90]  Or you want to
[5497.90 --> 5498.76]  Dig into that
[5498.76 --> 5499.54]  Grab me
[5499.54 --> 5500.52]  After the service
[5500.52 --> 5501.04]  And I'll get you
[5501.04 --> 5501.62]  On that list
[5501.62 --> 5502.10]  And we will
[5502.10 --> 5503.10]  Get that going
[5503.10 --> 5504.30]  Please
[5504.30 --> 5504.90]  Dig
[5504.90 --> 5505.90]  Deep
[5505.90 --> 5508.28]  Because Sunday
[5508.28 --> 5510.38]  Isn't enough
[5510.38 --> 5513.86]  It's the bare minimum
[5513.86 --> 5514.90]  And let's start here
[5514.90 --> 5517.92]  But listening to me
[5517.92 --> 5519.56]  Isn't enough
[5519.56 --> 5522.68]  Singing some songs
[5522.68 --> 5525.16]  As great as they are
[5525.16 --> 5527.02]  Isn't enough
[5527.02 --> 5529.46]  We need
[5529.46 --> 5530.88]  To be transformed
[5530.88 --> 5532.60]  By the gospel
[5532.60 --> 5533.70]  Of grace
[5533.70 --> 5534.82]  And so we must
[5534.82 --> 5536.62]  Immerse ourselves
[5536.62 --> 5537.62]  In the gospel
[5537.62 --> 5538.56]  Because in immersing
[5538.56 --> 5539.14]  Ourselves
[5539.14 --> 5540.26]  In the gospel
[5540.26 --> 5542.40]  We are drawing near
[5542.40 --> 5544.00]  To no one other
[5544.00 --> 5544.88]  Than Jesus
[5544.88 --> 5546.28]  Christ
[5546.28 --> 5548.88]  And it is in his name
[5548.88 --> 5550.62]  We go
[5550.62 --> 5552.12]  It is in his name
[5552.12 --> 5553.04]  We pray
[5553.04 --> 5554.08]  It is in his name
[5554.08 --> 5555.02]  That we together say
[5555.02 --> 5556.14]  Amen
[5556.14 --> 5557.78]  Let's pray
[5557.78 --> 5566.58]  Holy God
[5566.58 --> 5569.90]  Open our eyes
[5569.90 --> 5570.36]  Today
[5570.36 --> 5571.36]  Once again
[5571.36 --> 5572.62]  To the
[5572.62 --> 5574.28]  Wondrous
[5574.28 --> 5575.30]  Mystery
[5575.30 --> 5576.80]  Of the gospel
[5576.80 --> 5579.22]  Open our eyes
[5579.22 --> 5579.94]  To the truth
[5579.94 --> 5581.00]  Of who we are
[5581.00 --> 5581.34]  To the
[5581.34 --> 5582.16]  To the sound
[5582.16 --> 5582.74]  Doctrine
[5582.74 --> 5583.78]  Of your word
[5583.78 --> 5584.66]  Plant it
[5584.66 --> 5586.00]  Deep within us
[5586.00 --> 5587.14]  So that from it
[5587.14 --> 5588.24]  You might grow
[5588.24 --> 5589.58]  In our lives
[5589.58 --> 5590.38]  So that we might
[5590.38 --> 5591.26]  Be transformed
[5591.26 --> 5591.76]  And so that
[5591.76 --> 5592.88]  As we go from
[5592.88 --> 5593.94]  This place transformed
[5593.94 --> 5595.22]  The world might see
[5595.22 --> 5596.18]  More and more
[5596.18 --> 5596.88]  Of you
[5596.88 --> 5598.28]  In all that we do
[5598.28 --> 5599.48]  In all that we say
[5599.48 --> 5600.98]  In who we are
[5600.98 --> 5602.18]  In the everyday
[5602.18 --> 5603.26]  Situations
[5603.26 --> 5604.20]  And circumstances
[5604.20 --> 5605.20]  Of life
[5605.20 --> 5608.00]  And as we stand
[5608.00 --> 5608.96]  Now Lord God
[5608.96 --> 5609.58]  To sing
[5609.58 --> 5611.50]  May we sing
[5611.50 --> 5612.70]  Captivated
[5612.70 --> 5613.44]  By the beauty
[5613.44 --> 5614.12]  Of the gospel
[5614.12 --> 5615.18]  May we sing
[5615.18 --> 5615.98]  Compelled
[5615.98 --> 5616.86]  To shout
[5616.86 --> 5617.80]  From the mountaintops
[5617.80 --> 5618.32]  The truth
[5618.32 --> 5619.12]  Of Jesus Christ
[5619.12 --> 5620.52]  May we sing
[5620.52 --> 5622.24]  Your praises
[5622.24 --> 5623.00]  Lord Jesus
[5623.00 --> 5624.54]  Because we see
[5624.54 --> 5625.82]  Your face
[5625.82 --> 5626.34]  Here
[5626.34 --> 5627.58]  And now
[5627.58 --> 5628.40]  Together
[5628.40 --> 5631.72]  We live our lives
[5631.72 --> 5632.32]  In praise
[5632.32 --> 5632.84]  Of you
[5632.84 --> 5634.32]  And so we praise
[5634.32 --> 5634.62]  You
[5634.62 --> 5635.48]  Lord Jesus
[5635.48 --> 5636.56]  Amen
[5636.56 --> 5666.54]  Come be home
[5666.54 --> 5669.86]  Hope the wondrous mystery
[5669.86 --> 5672.52]  In the dawning
[5672.52 --> 5675.26]  Of the King
[5675.26 --> 5677.58]  He the theme
[5677.58 --> 5680.62]  Of heaven's praises
[5680.62 --> 5684.58]  Robed in frail humanity
[5684.58 --> 5688.30]  In our longing
[5688.30 --> 5690.84]  In our darkness
[5690.84 --> 5693.68]  Now the light
[5693.68 --> 5696.34]  Of life has come
[5696.34 --> 5698.50]  Looked to Christ
[5698.50 --> 5701.26]  Who condescended
[5701.26 --> 5703.70]  Took on flesh
[5703.70 --> 5707.56]  To ransom us
[5707.56 --> 5716.64]  Come behold
[5716.64 --> 5719.42]  The wondrous mystery

[5724.72 --> 5727.00]  In his living
[5727.00 --> 5729.70]  In his suffering
[5729.70 --> 5731.80]  Never trace
[5731.80 --> 5733.14]  Nor stain
[5733.14 --> 5734.72]  Of sin
[5734.72 --> 5736.70]  See the true
[5736.70 --> 5738.50]  And better
