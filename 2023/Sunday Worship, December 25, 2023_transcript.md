[177.70 --> 185.42]  These fields, well, they, they keep in their sleep

[253.46 --> 256.46]  It war a day
[256.96 --> 259.46]  Where the santos in fields
[259.46 --> 260.96]  Was the �rum
[260.96 --> 262.46]  Was the було of heat
[262.46 --> 264.96]  Cause the light of stone
[264.96 --> 267.26]  Yeah, shepherds in fields
[267.26 --> 271.46]  And you're staying before our clothes
[271.46 --> 276.46]  Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
[276.46 --> 282.94]  I would travel far in the world of shakir.
[282.94 --> 288.28]  I would do my work more as I move.
[289.40 --> 292.94]  I would give to him my heart.
[293.50 --> 299.14]  Nahi, chari, forevermore, forevermore.

[315.82 --> 319.82]  Nahi, chari, forevermore, forevermore.
[319.82 --> 325.82]  If in the night you are, I want to build a starry sky.
[325.82 --> 332.82]  This baby born for sacrifice, Christ the Messiah.
[332.82 --> 339.82]  To our hopes and to our fears, the Savior of the world appears.
[339.82 --> 346.82]  The promise of eternity, the promise of a son of a son.
[346.82 --> 352.82]  Ahi, chari, forevermore, forevermore.
[352.82 --> 358.82]  And whatOUGH you like, capstone.

[372.94 --> 376.82]  Our child is born to us, child is born
[376.82 --> 380.66]  The king of kings and the lord of Aaliyah
[380.66 --> 385.82]  And he shall reign forevermore, forevermore
[385.82 --> 387.82]  Aaliyah
[387.82 --> 393.82]  Aaliyah
[393.82 --> 400.86]  Good morning!
[402.38 --> 405.80]  Merry Christmas to all of you!
[405.92 --> 415.32]  It is so good to be here to worship our God, to welcome Jesus into the world and to sing his praises together.
[415.54 --> 419.42]  If you are a guest with us this morning, a special welcome to you.
[419.58 --> 421.88]  My name is Chris. I'm one of the pastors here.
[421.88 --> 428.42]  And it's my privilege, along with a few others, to lead in our worship of Jesus this morning.
[429.26 --> 441.16]  Throughout the season of Christmas and Advent, we have been looking at the words of waiting, or the words of Advent, in peace, hope, joy, and love.
[441.16 --> 452.58]  As we have done that at the beginning of our worship services, there's been a short video explaining the words of the Bible and how they're used and where they come from,
[453.28 --> 456.90]  and helping us enter into that reflection together.
[456.90 --> 467.56]  To begin our worship today, we have asked the children from Children's Worship Time to answer the questions,
[468.22 --> 470.26]  what does peace mean to you?
[470.78 --> 473.40]  Or what does hope mean to you?
[473.50 --> 475.28]  Where do you find joy?
[475.72 --> 476.94]  And how do you see love?
[476.94 --> 484.40]  And so we've got a short video where the kids from our Children's Worship Time program have answered those questions,
[484.40 --> 489.34]  and we wanted to set that up for you and encourage you to listen well,
[489.34 --> 497.48]  because some of them don't speak as loudly and as projecting as you might otherwise hear from someone on stage.
[497.56 --> 501.28]  So listen with your listening ears and listen well.
[501.52 --> 502.92]  Let's start with that.
[502.92 --> 506.92]  Let's start with that.
[506.94 --> 536.92]  Let's start with that.
[536.94 --> 538.96]  When you have a peaceful boat ride.
[539.30 --> 540.98]  Can you give me an example of peace?
[541.22 --> 541.52]  Nope.
[541.96 --> 542.84]  For yours?
[544.72 --> 545.54]  It's on this time.
[550.14 --> 551.02]  One video.
[555.82 --> 557.72]  Can you tell me something about hope?
[559.72 --> 561.02]  About other people.
[561.02 --> 561.52]  Hope.
[561.52 --> 565.10]  Hoping to get something.
[565.10 --> 572.62]  Like for Christmas, you would like hope to get like a like remote control.
[572.62 --> 575.98]  I just got my whole family.
[575.98 --> 579.80]  I hope my birthday comes in.
[579.80 --> 584.08]  Can you give me an example of hope?
[584.08 --> 585.12]  Tell the truth.
[585.12 --> 588.32]  I hope Easter cake has it.
[588.32 --> 595.60]  What is an example of joy?
[595.60 --> 595.64]  What is an example of joy?
[595.64 --> 596.64]  Joyful.
[596.64 --> 599.94]  When you're happy for something.
[599.94 --> 599.96]  When you're happy for something.
[599.96 --> 604.40]  When I'm at the playground.
[604.40 --> 605.68]  Reading a book.
[605.68 --> 609.70]  Can you give me an example of joy?
[609.70 --> 611.90]  When you score a goal in soccer.
[611.90 --> 615.22]  Like a great present.
[615.22 --> 621.28]  Like being happy after somebody does something with you.
[621.28 --> 624.28]  Can you give me an example of love?
[627.74 --> 629.86]  By helping someone with math?
[637.24 --> 638.18]  Do you want to say it again?
[638.18 --> 638.70]  Nice and loud?
[638.70 --> 639.70]  Like dinosaurs.
[640.80 --> 641.04]  Yeah.
[642.18 --> 643.26]  Don't miss them.
[647.08 --> 649.08]  Be nice to everybody.
[649.08 --> 656.18]  While you're lookingylan is happy.
[664.30 --> 666.32]  And how we like mornings for poder.
[670.32 --> 672.50]  Giving someone something?
[677.74 --> 678.52]  Um.
[678.52 --> 684.22]  we'll come back to those in just a moment. But if anyone needs help with math, Emmett is here for
[684.22 --> 691.08]  you. We are here to gather and worship our God. And so I'm going to invite you to stand.
[691.82 --> 697.88]  God will welcome us into his presence with his greeting. And then following God's greeting,
[698.20 --> 703.56]  invite you to turn to those around you in worship and offer them a Merry Christmas if you haven't
[703.56 --> 710.04]  and pass the peace of Christ, share God's greeting together. Receive the greeting of our God on this
[710.04 --> 718.36]  Christmas morning. Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ,
[718.48 --> 726.02]  Son, and our Savior, through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Let's welcome each other to worship.
[733.56 --> 735.58]  Amen.
[735.58 --> 765.56]  Thank you.
[765.58 --> 776.76]  As we light the Christ candle today, we are reminded of the true meaning of Christmas and of who Christ is. The hope, peace, joy, and love everlasting.
[795.58 --> 796.58]  Amen.
[796.58 --> 797.58]  Amen.
[797.58 --> 798.58]  Amen.
[826.58 --> 827.58] 
[856.58 --> 857.58]  Amen.
[857.58 --> 859.70]  and his kingdom shall never end.
[862.90 --> 867.44]  How will this be, Mary asked the angel, since I am a virgin?
[868.20 --> 871.24]  The angel answered, The Holy Spirit will come on you,
[871.50 --> 874.46]  and the power of the Most High will overshadow you.
[874.98 --> 878.24]  So the Holy One to be born will be called the Son of David.
[878.94 --> 883.06]  Even Elizabeth, your relative, is going to have a child in her old age,
[883.06 --> 887.84]  and she who was said to be unable to conceive is in her six months,
[888.36 --> 890.64]  for no word from God will ever fail.
[891.56 --> 893.72]  I am the Lord's servant, Mary answered.
[894.00 --> 896.04]  May your word to me be fulfilled.
[896.38 --> 897.50]  Then the angel left her.
[906.94 --> 909.78]  In those days, Caesar Augustus issued a decree
[909.78 --> 912.66]  that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world.
[913.06 --> 915.28]  This was the first census that took place
[915.28 --> 918.28]  while Corneus was governor over Sirius,
[918.42 --> 921.46]  and everyone went to their own town to register.
[921.86 --> 925.62]  So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee
[925.62 --> 928.32]  to Judea, to Bethlehem, the town of David,
[929.26 --> 932.22]  because he belonged to the house and the line of David.
[932.68 --> 934.22]  He went there to register with Mary,
[934.68 --> 937.82]  who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child.
[937.82 --> 943.66]  While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born,
[944.10 --> 946.46]  and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son.
[947.28 --> 950.04]  She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger
[950.04 --> 952.62]  because there was no guest room available for them.
[953.74 --> 956.08]  And there were shepherds living out in the fiers nearby,
[956.62 --> 958.36]  keeping watch over their flocks at night.
[959.10 --> 960.84]  An angel of the Lord appeared to them,
[961.04 --> 963.24]  and the glory of the Lord shone around them,
[963.24 --> 964.36]  and they were terrified.
[965.92 --> 967.54]  But the angel said to them,
[967.68 --> 968.62]  Do not be afraid.
[968.72 --> 971.94]  I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people.
[972.38 --> 975.46]  Today in the town of David, a Savior has been born to you.
[975.76 --> 977.40]  He is the Messiah, the Lord.
[978.00 --> 979.48]  This will be a sign to you.
[979.58 --> 981.48]  You will find a baby wrapped in clothes,
[981.56 --> 982.28]  lying in a manger.
[982.98 --> 985.84]  Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host
[985.84 --> 990.66]  appeared with the angel praising God and saying,
[990.98 --> 992.58]  Glory to God in the highest heaven,
[993.00 --> 997.64]  and on earth peace to those whom his favor rests.
[997.64 --> 1012.20]  When the angels had left them and gone into heaven,
[1012.86 --> 1016.10]  the shepherds said to one another,
[1016.50 --> 1019.70]  Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened,
[1019.82 --> 1021.50]  which the Lord has told us about.
[1021.50 --> 1026.80]  So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph and the baby
[1026.80 --> 1028.32]  who was lying in the manger.
[1029.28 --> 1030.50]  When they had seen him,
[1030.62 --> 1035.62]  they spread the word concerning what had been told to them about this child.
[1036.20 --> 1040.52]  And all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherd had said to them.
[1041.16 --> 1044.20]  But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart.
[1044.56 --> 1047.52]  The shepherd returned, glorifying and praising God
[1047.52 --> 1050.30]  for all the things that they had heard and seen,
[1050.30 --> 1052.82]  which were just as they had been told.
[1052.82 --> 1053.22]  Thank you.
[1053.22 --> 1053.28]  Thank you.
[1080.30 --> 1083.86]  Belimi award and humorous.
[1083.86 --> 1086.30]  Glorys in Exercix Deo.
[1087.48 --> 1087.88]  Gloria.
[1094.38 --> 1096.30]  Gloria.
[1096.50 --> 1096.52]  In Exercix Deo.
[1097.08 --> 1100.58]  In Exercix Deo.
[1105.26 --> 1106.68]  Gloria.
[1106.68 --> 1107.26]  Coke kin entendu.
[1107.26 --> 1110.28]  Angels we have heard are hard.
[1110.28 --> 1115.36]  Sweetly singing o'er the plains
[1115.36 --> 1120.08]  And the mountains every fly
[1120.08 --> 1124.78]  Echoing their joyous wings
[1124.78 --> 1138.88]  Gloryer in excelsis Deo
[1138.88 --> 1154.88]  Gloria, it shall save Deion
[1154.88 --> 1161.88]  Shepherds, why this jubilee?
[1161.88 --> 1166.88]  Why your joyous strains prolong?
[1166.88 --> 1170.88]  What the blessings I need
[1170.88 --> 1175.88]  Which inspire your heavenly songs
[1175.88 --> 1189.88]  Gloria, it shall save Deion
[1189.88 --> 1204.88]  Gloria, it shall save Deion
[1204.88 --> 1212.88]  Come to Bethlehem sing
[1212.88 --> 1217.88]  In whose word the angels sing
[1217.88 --> 1221.88]  Come adore our melody
[1221.88 --> 1226.88]  Christ the Lord, the new King
[1226.88 --> 1227.88]  Gloria, it shall save Deion
[1227.88 --> 1240.88]  Gloria, it shall save Deion
[1240.88 --> 1242.88]  Gloria, it shall save Deion
[1242.88 --> 1246.88]  Gloria, it shall save Deion
[1246.88 --> 1256.88]  Gloria, it shall save Deion
[1256.88 --> 1261.88]  While we go into our next song of Joy to the World
[1261.88 --> 1266.88]  We encourage all the kids if they can come up, there's a big bowl full of bells.
[1266.88 --> 1271.88]  Please feel free to come up, grab one and bring them as we sing this song together.
[1271.88 --> 1274.88]  And then afterwards you can put them back in the bowl.
[1274.88 --> 1276.88]  Please feel free to come up, grab one and bring them as we sing this song.
[1276.88 --> 1280.88]  Please feel free to come up, grab one and bring them as we sing this song.
[1280.88 --> 1281.88]  Wait for me.
[1281.88 --> 1285.88]  We come up, we come up.
[1285.88 --> 1290.88]  You can put on Your love, you strings in the mouth and put it.
[1290.88 --> 1292.88]  Most lyrics are a song.
[1292.88 --> 1297.88]  There are many more tricks, you every single arts, you can't give them as we sing this song.

[1496.88 --> 1509.88]  Joy, unspeakable joy, it rises in my soul, and never lets me go.
[1512.88 --> 1529.88]  The bell ringing was great, thank you.
[1529.88 --> 1532.88]  You can place them all back in the bowl on the stage, thank you.
[1532.88 --> 1533.88]  Thank you.

[1545.88 --> 1546.88]  Thank you.
[1546.88 --> 1547.88]  Thank you.
[1547.88 --> 1548.88]  Thank you.
[1548.88 --> 1549.88]  Thank you.
[1549.88 --> 1553.88]  Oh come all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant.
[1553.88 --> 1571.98]  O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant,
[1571.98 --> 1581.38]  O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem.
[1581.38 --> 1591.38]  Come and behold Him, born the King of angels.
[1591.38 --> 1596.38]  O come, let us adore Him.
[1596.38 --> 1601.38]  O come, let us adore Him.
[1601.38 --> 1610.38]  O come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord.
[1611.38 --> 1622.38]  Sing choirs of angels, sing in exultation.
[1622.38 --> 1632.38]  Sing, all ye citizens of Bethlehem.
[1632.38 --> 1642.38]  Glory to God, all glory in the highest.
[1642.38 --> 1647.38]  O come, let us adore Him.
[1647.38 --> 1652.38]  O come, let us adore Him.
[1652.38 --> 1664.38]  O come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord.
[1664.38 --> 1674.38]  Hey, Lord, we bring Him for this happy morning.
[1674.38 --> 1684.38]  Jesus, to Thee be all glory in the highest.
[1684.38 --> 1693.38]  Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing.
[1693.38 --> 1703.38]  O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him.
[1703.38 --> 1715.38]  O come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord.

[1725.38 --> 1728.38]  Please be seated.
[1728.38 --> 1733.38]  O come, let us adore Him.
[1733.38 --> 1739.38]  For many people, Christmas is a meaningless, depressing time.
[1739.38 --> 1745.38]  Many make excuses why the birth of a Savior makes no difference to them.
[1745.38 --> 1749.38]  If we could look into their hearts, what would we see?
[1749.38 --> 1751.38]  Would we see heartache and pain?
[1751.38 --> 1760.38]  Lonely people, unwilling or unable to let Him take over their lives and their hearts?
[1760.38 --> 1769.38]  If we look hard enough, maybe we can see something of ourselves, the way we were or are still.
[1769.38 --> 1771.38]  What is that to me?
[1771.38 --> 1776.38]  A child was born on Christmas Day, but what is that to me?
[1776.38 --> 1780.38]  For I have many troubles and cares and bills to pay, you see.
[1780.38 --> 1788.38]  A Savior was born on Christmas Day to set His people free, but I am bound by worries and fears.
[1788.38 --> 1790.38]  So what is that to me?
[1790.38 --> 1795.38]  The Son of God was born to die, but what is that to me?
[1795.38 --> 1797.38]  So many children were born to die.
[1797.38 --> 1799.38]  How many must there be?
[1799.38 --> 1805.38]  A king was born that night, they say, to worship on bended knee.
[1805.38 --> 1809.38]  But I still have to live this life, so what is that to me?
[1809.38 --> 1813.38]  Jesus Christ, the Savior, was born.
[1813.38 --> 1815.38]  They say He holds the key.
[1815.38 --> 1818.38]  But my heavy heart is locked inside.
[1818.38 --> 1820.38]  So what is that to me?
[1820.38 --> 1828.38]  The Lord of creation was born that day, born to die for me.
[1828.38 --> 1832.38]  So I could live and die in peace.
[1832.38 --> 1835.38]  He's everything to me.
[1835.38 --> 1836.38]  He's everything to me.
[1836.38 --> 1845.38]  Jesus Christ, the Savior, is being awakened in peace.
[1845.38 --> 1852.38]  You can focus on Him myself.

[2566.82 --> 2572.82]  Merry Christmas. How fitting that today, the day we celebrate God's awesome gift to us,
[2572.82 --> 2578.82]  we are able to be a blessing to others and have a collection for the Benevolence Fund.
[2578.82 --> 2582.82]  The money from this fund is used to help those in need,
[2582.82 --> 2588.82]  whether they are members of this congregation or others who have come to us from the community.
[2589.82 --> 2592.82]  The needs vary and are evaluated by the deacons.
[2592.82 --> 2600.82]  It is our privilege through your generosity to be Christ's hands and feet to their need
[2600.82 --> 2603.82]  and be a blessing to them. Thank you.
[2630.82 --> 2633.82]  Thank you.
[2633.82 --> 2637.82]  Thank you.

[2841.80 --> 2843.80]  Thank you.
[2843.80 --> 2845.80]  Thank you.
[2845.80 --> 2853.80]  Thank you.
[2853.80 --> 2855.80]  Thank you.
[2855.80 --> 2857.80]  Thank you.
[2857.80 --> 2863.80]  Thank you.
[2863.80 --> 2865.80]  Thank you.
[2865.80 --> 2867.80]  Thank you.
[2867.80 --> 2869.80]  Thank you.
[2869.80 --> 2873.80]  Thank you.
[2873.80 --> 2885.80]  I think you're...
[2885.80 --> 2892.16]  challenges that we face. And I think sometimes this can give us maybe a feeling of whiplash.
[2892.26 --> 2904.52]  On the one hand, we want to be so very excited all the time, but life can be hard. And we
[2904.52 --> 2909.76]  want to remember this week people who have recently lost loved ones. We want to remember
[2909.76 --> 2916.34]  the Hummelman family as Anne passed away. We want to remember Greta Visser and her family
[2916.34 --> 2924.96]  as Cy also has passed this last week. We want to remember Tanya Smith and Samara Isinga as
[2924.96 --> 2933.10]  their grandmother. Judy also passed away recently in Ontario. These are just three families,
[2933.10 --> 2944.92]  Lord. And we know everyone here grieves loss. And this season can be really, really hard.
[2945.60 --> 2951.62]  So for all those people who are grieving, Father, will you grant a full measure of encouragement,
[2952.96 --> 2961.12]  connectedness, and community. We want to remember, too, the underemployed or unemployed people in
[2961.12 --> 2969.46]  our midst. And we want to remember those people who are really struggling because of inflation.
[2970.52 --> 2979.54]  These are conditions that aren't visible easily. So give all of us eyes to see and ears to hear
[2979.54 --> 2993.22]  the need around us. And in the world today, we know there is raging conflicts all around us.
[2993.56 --> 3002.10]  And we ask in this season of remembering the Incarnation, Lord, that peace may prevail.
[3002.10 --> 3009.20]  And I know it is easy looking at how we people behave to scoff at the idea that there may be peace.
[3011.40 --> 3020.22]  But it is possible. So we ask that leaders of the world may acknowledge you and yield to you.
[3020.22 --> 3031.50]  And again, Lord, we ask today for a blessing in all our families as we celebrate you and your birth.
[3032.70 --> 3032.96]  Amen.
[3032.96 --> 3033.06]  Amen.
[3033.06 --> 3033.08]  Amen.
[3033.08 --> 3033.10]  Amen.

[3033.32 --> 3033.36]  Amen.
[3050.22 --> 3063.32]  Amen.
[3063.32 --> 3063.44]  Amen.
[3063.44 --> 3064.16]  Amen.
[3064.16 --> 3064.44]  Amen.
[3064.44 --> 3065.32]  Mad Strengthsen liked it.
[3065.32 --> 3066.62]  Amen.
[3066.62 --> 3067.32]  Amen.
[3067.32 --> 3068.32]  Amen.
[3068.32 --> 3068.48]  Amen.
[3068.48 --> 3068.66]  Amen.
[3068.66 --> 3069.52]  Amen.
[3073.46 --> 3074.34]  Amen.
[3074.34 --> 3076.36]  Amen.
[3076.36 --> 3077.36]  Amen.
[3077.36 --> 3078.22]  Amen.
[3078.22 --> 3079.22]  Amen.
[3079.22 --> 3080.20]  Amen.
[3080.20 --> 3086.88]  peace, hope, joy, and love. We've been looking at the offerings of the world for those things and
[3086.88 --> 3097.28]  turning to God's Word to see what He has to fill us and fulfill in us a sense of peace, hope, joy,
[3097.28 --> 3106.08]  and an awareness of His love. And so this morning, I would like to pull all of those
[3106.08 --> 3115.22]  things together into one offering. Now, as we've done that, we've been able to hold that in parallel
[3115.22 --> 3123.80]  to and in contrast to what's commonly offered. What I hope we can see today and then the culmination
[3123.80 --> 3135.60]  of all of this is that in the fullest and most real possible sense, Jesus is your peace. Jesus
[3135.60 --> 3147.14]  is your hope. Jesus is your joy. And Jesus shows us true love. Now, all of those four truths are packed
[3147.14 --> 3155.54]  into the text that I want to share with you this morning. And so I'm going to read from Luke 1.
[3156.72 --> 3165.56]  I'm going to read starting at verse 30, just to verse 33, which is a few short verses. It's the
[3165.56 --> 3176.20]  angel's response to Mary after Gabriel has said, you will be with child. And so Luke 1 verse 30.
[3177.10 --> 3184.98]  But the angel said to her, do not be afraid, Mary. You have found favor with God. You will conceive and
[3184.98 --> 3192.36]  give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the
[3192.36 --> 3199.52]  Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over Jacob's
[3199.52 --> 3205.28]  descendants forever. His kingdom will never end.
[3205.28 --> 3216.02]  As we dig into this morning, I'm going to provide a little bit of a road map. And so what I hope that
[3216.02 --> 3224.46]  you will see, and it should be on the screen behind me, is out of this text, using the words from Gabriel,
[3224.56 --> 3229.80]  where it says, he will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him
[3229.80 --> 3235.62]  the throne of his father David, and he will reign over Jacob's descendants forever. His kingdom will
[3235.62 --> 3243.10]  never end. Using that descriptor, what I hope we will see is the straight line from Jesus is our peace,
[3243.20 --> 3250.82]  like I have said, to from his kingdom will never end. And then Jesus is our hope. The Lord will give him
[3250.82 --> 3257.82]  the throne of his father David. Jesus is our joy. He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High.
[3257.82 --> 3264.18]  And Jesus shows us true love. He will reign over Jacob's descendants forever.
[3265.14 --> 3270.48]  Now you can hold that in your head. You can see it there. We will come back and we'll tie all that together
[3270.48 --> 3279.80]  at the end. Before we dig into it, though, I suspect that some of you sitting here this morning are already
[3279.80 --> 3282.06]  wondering, well, why does it matter?
[3282.06 --> 3291.08]  Right? Why does it matter to me? You might say. Because you might sit there and you think, you know,
[3291.18 --> 3299.24]  if Jesus is a source of peace for you, great. Some of you are thinking, or some of you know people
[3299.24 --> 3304.94]  who think or have said something like, you know, it's great that Jesus is a source of hope for you.
[3304.94 --> 3312.96]  He's just not that for me. Sometimes you might hear people say, yeah, sure, Jesus shows us love and he
[3312.96 --> 3319.56]  shows us how to be good people. But so does Gandhi. So does Buddha. Right? I don't need Jesus to do that.
[3319.68 --> 3327.84]  I don't need any sort of religious person. I can just do it myself. And if that's you this morning,
[3327.84 --> 3335.62]  if that's how you think, or if that's what you have said in your heart, first, I just want to say
[3335.62 --> 3343.52]  thank you. Thank you for being here. Thank you for coming and being part of this. I'm sure it's because
[3343.52 --> 3348.48]  you're trying to make mom happy or because grandma has said, please come to church with us.
[3349.52 --> 3354.22]  Or it's because it's Christmas. And if you're going to go to church once a year, it might as well be on
[3354.22 --> 3360.64]  Christmas because it's bound to be happy on Christmas. And so thank you for coming. And I
[3360.64 --> 3366.94]  really mean that. And I hope you hear that. Thank you for being here. And even if you've never said
[3366.94 --> 3374.16]  that, we all know people who have, or we all know people who will. And so maybe this is part of a
[3374.16 --> 3379.04]  conversation that you're going to have later today when you sit around that big feast of a table,
[3379.04 --> 3385.36]  or when you have conversations with friends and family in the week, or when you go back to university
[3385.36 --> 3391.12]  and college and your friends say, what did you do on Christmas? And you say, I went to church.
[3391.30 --> 3401.92]  And they go, why on earth would you do that? Now, to make my job even harder, I need you to hear what
[3401.92 --> 3410.00]  I said. Because I didn't say that Jesus was a source of peace or a source of hope. I didn't say that
[3410.00 --> 3419.04]  Jesus was a source of joy or an example of love among many others out there. What I said was,
[3420.16 --> 3431.82]  Jesus is peace. He is hope. He is joy. He is the expression of love taken on flesh. He's
[3431.82 --> 3440.78]  not just the ultimate example in a hierarchy of being. He is being itself. Jesus is your peace.
[3441.56 --> 3451.80]  Jesus is your hope. Jesus is your joy. And Jesus is your true love. In fact, that's why God sent
[3451.80 --> 3459.16]  angels to proclaim him. That's why Gabriel appeared before Mary and told her this great news that he
[3459.16 --> 3464.80]  will be great and will be called son of the most high. The Lord God will give him the throne of his
[3464.80 --> 3471.52]  father, David, and he will reign over Jacob's descendants forever. His kingdom will never end.
[3472.60 --> 3479.12]  That's why angels proclaim his birth to the shepherds that fate filled glorious night. We already
[3479.12 --> 3484.88]  heard it, right? There were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks
[3484.88 --> 3490.74]  at night. An angel of the Lord appeared to them and the glory of the Lord shone around them and they
[3490.74 --> 3498.60]  were terrified. But the angel said to them, do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great
[3498.60 --> 3506.02]  joy for all the people. Today in the town of David, a savior has been born to you. He is the Messiah,
[3506.36 --> 3512.26]  the Lord. This will be a sign to you. You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.
[3512.26 --> 3517.82]  And then this image, suddenly a great company of heavenly hosts appeared with the angel praising
[3517.82 --> 3526.40]  God and saying, glory to God in the highest heaven and on earth, peace to those on whom his favor rests.
[3526.72 --> 3534.36]  This is amazing. And angels came to proclaim him because nothing like this had ever happened before.
[3534.36 --> 3544.36]  Nothing like this was even fathomable before. God came down and took on flesh.
[3546.00 --> 3553.94]  Now, don't get me wrong, right? Greek religious traditions, Roman religious ideas, Canaanite,
[3554.06 --> 3560.12]  Egyptian, Babylonian religions all have stories of a God coming down to earth.
[3560.12 --> 3567.22]  But in those systems and in those stories, those gods are fundamentally different than the God of
[3567.22 --> 3575.08]  the Bible, right? In those religions and in those histories and traditions, for them, it's a hierarchy
[3575.08 --> 3581.20]  of being, right? Where you're just sort of moving up the ladder, where you have non-living minerals at
[3581.20 --> 3588.16]  the bottom and then plants and then animals and then humans and then spiritual beings like angels or
[3588.16 --> 3594.08]  fairies and the like and then a God and then probably over them another series of gods.
[3595.12 --> 3602.50]  The God of the Bible stands apart from all of that because he is transcendent to all other
[3602.50 --> 3609.34]  being. You simply can't climb the ladder high enough to find him. Something else has to happen.
[3609.34 --> 3620.18]  He has to come to us. That's Christmas. That's Emmanuel, God with us, right? A baby born in a food
[3620.18 --> 3626.80]  trough is the creator of the world. The one from whom, through whom, and for whom all things are
[3626.80 --> 3635.02]  created entered into space and time of creation. The infinite became finite. The word that was God and
[3635.02 --> 3646.36]  was with God made his dwelling among us. This truth is uniquely Christian. And 300 years after Jesus,
[3647.16 --> 3654.56]  the church tried to encapsulate this truth in a creed. So there was a big gathering of church leaders
[3654.56 --> 3661.28]  and to make this point, they came together and they shared with the world the Nicene Creed.
[3661.28 --> 3667.58]  The Nicene Creed, its first form written in 325 AD, says this,
[3669.08 --> 3675.64]  The one Lord Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, begotten of the Father before all ages,
[3675.82 --> 3683.94]  God from God, light from light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, of the same essence
[3683.94 --> 3690.80]  as the Father. Now if you hear that, remember the words that we sang earlier, the second verse of,
[3690.80 --> 3694.18]  O come all ye faithful, this is the source material for it.
[3696.58 --> 3697.88]  Right? The creed continues,
[3698.30 --> 3704.28]  Through him, that's Jesus, all things were made for us and for our salvation. He came down from heaven.
[3704.74 --> 3709.56]  He became incarnate by the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary and was made human.
[3709.56 --> 3719.54]  When you say that Jesus is a source, among many others, of peace, or a source, among many others,
[3719.54 --> 3728.62]  of hope or joy or love, you are actually coming to Christmas with an incomplete idea of who Jesus is.
[3729.38 --> 3734.68]  To be candid, you're coming to Christmas with a pagan idea of who Jesus is.
[3734.68 --> 3742.66]  It's closer to a Greek or Roman or Canaanite, Egyptian or Babylonian ideas of how God and gods relate to the world
[3742.66 --> 3746.96]  than it is to the Bible. It's not the incarnation of the Bible.
[3747.78 --> 3748.88]  Let me illustrate that point.
[3749.68 --> 3753.24]  This is an illustration I first came across in the book Center Church.
[3753.24 --> 3766.04]  In 1961, Yuri Gagarin was the first man to go into space and orbit Earth.
[3766.74 --> 3772.56]  He's a Soviet cosmonaut, and he's piloting a spacecraft called Vostok 1.
[3772.56 --> 3786.04]  After his orbit, which took 108 minutes, he came back down to Earth and went to the USSR space station and gave an interview.
[3786.56 --> 3792.32]  And because he wanted to affirm the official atheism of the state,
[3793.14 --> 3796.16]  he is reported to have said something like,
[3796.16 --> 3802.66]  I have been to the heavens, I looked and looked, and I didn't see God anywhere.
[3804.08 --> 3808.54]  His idea was he went up to space, to the heavens, and he couldn't find God.
[3809.30 --> 3815.64]  Now, perhaps it was tongue-in-cheek, but in the presumption, in that remark,
[3816.34 --> 3821.28]  the idea is that God is just higher up in the scale of being,
[3821.28 --> 3825.10]  and that if we could go high enough, we might find him.
[3826.26 --> 3831.36]  This is the same assumption undergirding the pride of humanity in the story of the Tower of Babel.
[3833.12 --> 3839.00]  Now, around the same time as this, C.S. Lewis, who's a Christian author,
[3839.36 --> 3841.44]  he's a literary genius and a philosopher,
[3842.02 --> 3845.44]  he's a writer of the Chronicles of Narnia or the Space Trilogy,
[3846.38 --> 3849.96]  he writes an essay called The Language of Religion.
[3849.96 --> 3856.40]  And in that essay, Lewis says that if there is a God,
[3856.88 --> 3862.18]  we don't relate to him like people on the first floor of a building
[3862.18 --> 3865.06]  relate to people on the second floor of the building,
[3865.06 --> 3866.96]  or even on the roof, if we can get high enough.
[3868.02 --> 3871.50]  That's what Uri Gagarin was doing when he said,
[3871.62 --> 3873.60]  I've been to heaven and I didn't see God there.
[3873.60 --> 3881.36]  Instead, Lewis says, we relate to God the way Hamlet relates to Shakespeare.
[3882.60 --> 3884.50]  Now, for those of you who don't remember,
[3884.98 --> 3889.00]  Hamlet is a play written around 1600 by Shakespeare.
[3890.06 --> 3892.94]  And what does Hamlet know of Shakespeare?
[3892.94 --> 3897.38]  Nothing.
[3898.76 --> 3902.16]  The only way Hamlet can know anything about Shakespeare,
[3903.94 --> 3908.16]  because Shakespeare completely transcends the world of Hamlet,
[3908.38 --> 3911.26]  the only way Hamlet can know anything about Shakespeare,
[3911.40 --> 3913.46]  because Shakespeare is above and outside of it,
[3913.52 --> 3917.56]  no amount of climbing into space for Hamlet will find Shakespeare,
[3917.56 --> 3920.40]  the only way Hamlet can know anything about him
[3920.40 --> 3923.48]  is if Shakespeare writes himself into the play
[3923.48 --> 3925.48]  and reveals himself to Hamlet.
[3929.48 --> 3931.16]  In the early 20th century,
[3932.16 --> 3935.40]  there's an English author by the name of Dorothy Sayers.
[3936.38 --> 3939.94]  She is one of the first women to go to Oxford University.
[3940.76 --> 3943.56]  She is a writer of mystery stories,
[3943.56 --> 3949.38]  and she writes a series of novels about a man named Lord Peter Whimsey.
[3950.04 --> 3952.72]  Lord Peter Whimsey in the novels is an aristocrat,
[3953.30 --> 3955.74]  a sleuth, and a lonely man.
[3957.22 --> 3960.68]  At some point in the series of novels that she has written,
[3961.16 --> 3963.16]  a new character appears in the story,
[3963.76 --> 3966.00]  and her name is Harriet Vane,
[3966.40 --> 3969.12]  and she is described in the novels
[3969.12 --> 3972.74]  as one of the first women to attend Oxford University,
[3972.74 --> 3975.50]  and as a writer of mystery novels.
[3977.02 --> 3979.20]  Eventually, Harriet and Peter meet,
[3979.34 --> 3981.14]  they fall in love, and they marry.
[3982.60 --> 3983.38]  You see what happened?
[3983.52 --> 3986.58]  Dorothy Sayers looked at the world she had created,
[3987.02 --> 3989.60]  the world that she had fallen in love with,
[3989.64 --> 3991.32]  at the characters that she had created
[3991.32 --> 3993.00]  and fallen in love with,
[3993.00 --> 3995.64]  and she wrote herself into that story
[3995.64 --> 3996.96]  in order to save him,
[3997.82 --> 3999.02]  in order to let him know
[3999.02 --> 4001.54]  the kind of love that she had for him.
[4002.74 --> 4004.56]  That's what happens in the incarnation.
[4005.96 --> 4008.46]  God looks at the world he created,
[4008.88 --> 4010.46]  and yet had rejected him,
[4010.96 --> 4013.64]  and because of his great love for us,
[4013.78 --> 4015.82]  he writes himself into the story.
[4016.80 --> 4018.20]  We can know God
[4018.20 --> 4020.64]  because he reveals himself to us
[4020.64 --> 4022.20]  at Christmas in the incarnation.
[4022.56 --> 4023.44]  We can know God
[4023.44 --> 4025.48]  because he has revealed himself to us
[4025.48 --> 4026.48]  in his word.
[4026.48 --> 4027.70]  We can know him
[4027.70 --> 4029.62]  because he came down to earth
[4029.62 --> 4031.02]  to be known.
[4033.88 --> 4034.54]  And so,
[4034.86 --> 4037.58]  to know something of this God,
[4038.14 --> 4041.16]  to know something of this word,
[4041.54 --> 4043.50]  of this son who was born,
[4043.66 --> 4046.66]  let's quickly do a survey.
[4047.42 --> 4049.74]  Paul writes in Colossians.
[4049.74 --> 4051.12]  He says,
[4051.66 --> 4053.06]  the son is the image
[4053.06 --> 4054.40]  of the invisible God,
[4054.50 --> 4056.60]  the firstborn over all creation.
[4057.00 --> 4058.28]  The son, Jesus,
[4058.48 --> 4060.10]  is how we see God.
[4060.96 --> 4062.26]  You've heard me say before
[4062.26 --> 4063.10]  that in Jesus,
[4063.32 --> 4064.40]  God gets a face.
[4065.82 --> 4067.04]  For in him,
[4067.16 --> 4068.56]  all things were created,
[4068.72 --> 4069.98]  things in heaven and on earth,
[4070.12 --> 4071.18]  visible and invisible,
[4071.66 --> 4073.02]  whether thrones or powers
[4073.02 --> 4074.36]  or rulers or authorities.
[4074.96 --> 4076.52]  All things have been created
[4076.52 --> 4078.00]  through him and for him.
[4078.00 --> 4079.72]  He is before all things
[4079.72 --> 4080.60]  and in him,
[4080.92 --> 4082.64]  all things hold together.
[4082.92 --> 4083.78]  Again, hear this.
[4083.88 --> 4085.30]  That's the transcendence, right?
[4085.42 --> 4086.76]  He, in the Godhead,
[4086.86 --> 4089.06]  is above and apart from
[4089.06 --> 4090.74]  the world that he created.
[4092.56 --> 4092.78]  And then,
[4092.92 --> 4093.98]  for God was pleased
[4093.98 --> 4095.30]  to have all his fullness
[4095.30 --> 4096.30]  dwell in him.
[4097.14 --> 4097.72]  That is,
[4097.82 --> 4099.28]  like the Nicene Creed said,
[4099.38 --> 4100.88]  he is true God
[4100.88 --> 4102.16]  from true God.
[4102.98 --> 4103.94]  And through him,
[4104.06 --> 4105.50]  to reconcile to himself
[4105.50 --> 4106.12]  all things,
[4106.20 --> 4107.12]  whether things on earth
[4107.12 --> 4108.22]  or things in heaven
[4108.22 --> 4109.14]  by making peace
[4109.14 --> 4110.04]  through his blood
[4110.04 --> 4111.56]  shed on the cross.
[4112.28 --> 4113.02]  And Paul continues,
[4113.84 --> 4114.74]  see to it
[4114.74 --> 4116.58]  that no one takes you captive
[4116.58 --> 4117.38]  through hollow
[4117.38 --> 4118.74]  and deceptive philosophy,
[4118.74 --> 4119.70]  which depends on
[4119.70 --> 4120.46]  the human tradition,
[4120.58 --> 4121.72]  on the elemental forces
[4121.72 --> 4122.92]  of this world,
[4122.98 --> 4124.94]  rather than on Christ.
[4126.24 --> 4126.72]  And Paul is saying,
[4126.80 --> 4128.38]  don't accept a substitute
[4128.38 --> 4130.28]  for peace or hope
[4130.28 --> 4131.64]  or joy or love
[4131.64 --> 4133.78]  when Jesus is the true and better.
[4133.78 --> 4135.76]  don't settle for something
[4135.76 --> 4137.84]  imminent and available
[4137.84 --> 4140.38]  when the transcendent
[4140.38 --> 4142.32]  is now available to you.
[4143.94 --> 4144.76]  For in Christ,
[4144.94 --> 4146.58]  all the fullness of the deity
[4146.58 --> 4148.96]  lives in bodily form.
[4148.96 --> 4149.94]  And in Christ,
[4150.20 --> 4151.34]  you have been brought
[4151.34 --> 4152.14]  to fullness.
[4153.42 --> 4154.42]  And in Christ,
[4154.56 --> 4155.36]  you have been brought
[4155.36 --> 4155.86]  to fullness.
[4156.08 --> 4156.32]  That is,
[4156.70 --> 4158.30]  only in Jesus
[4158.30 --> 4160.26]  do you have life abundant
[4160.26 --> 4161.74]  and life eternal.
[4161.96 --> 4163.22]  And let me say really clearly,
[4163.58 --> 4164.60]  abundant and eternal
[4164.60 --> 4165.68]  are not just
[4165.68 --> 4167.54]  quantitative realities.
[4167.54 --> 4168.34]  It's not just that
[4168.34 --> 4169.76]  you're going to live forever,
[4170.14 --> 4172.14]  though that is true in God.
[4172.20 --> 4173.72]  In the fullness of Jesus
[4173.72 --> 4175.32]  giving you life,
[4175.78 --> 4177.16]  the fullness of Jesus
[4177.16 --> 4178.88]  is the fullness of life.
[4179.00 --> 4180.32]  And that begins here
[4180.32 --> 4181.06]  and now,
[4181.12 --> 4182.34]  in this moment,
[4182.34 --> 4183.42]  when you see Jesus
[4183.42 --> 4184.90]  for who he is.
[4185.98 --> 4187.98]  This is what is meant for you
[4187.98 --> 4190.72]  because God so loved the world
[4190.72 --> 4191.90]  that he wrote himself
[4191.90 --> 4193.70]  into the story.
[4194.68 --> 4197.74]  He is head over every power
[4197.74 --> 4199.06]  and authority.
[4201.12 --> 4202.18]  This Christmas,
[4202.94 --> 4204.22]  I pray,
[4204.96 --> 4207.36]  I pray that you would know
[4207.36 --> 4209.24]  the peace of Jesus.
[4209.42 --> 4210.86]  A peace that surpasses
[4210.86 --> 4212.28]  all understanding.
[4212.48 --> 4213.62]  A peace that is about
[4213.62 --> 4214.72]  your wholeness,
[4215.08 --> 4216.54]  your full humanity,
[4216.54 --> 4218.54]  your full image bearing,
[4218.96 --> 4220.20]  God glorifying,
[4220.46 --> 4222.06]  Jesus worshiping,
[4222.46 --> 4224.52]  being bought
[4224.52 --> 4225.52]  and brought
[4225.52 --> 4226.70]  to the fullness
[4226.70 --> 4228.74]  of God life.
[4230.30 --> 4232.02]  Whatever you've done
[4232.02 --> 4233.64]  doesn't matter
[4233.64 --> 4235.26]  because Jesus has done
[4235.26 --> 4236.86]  more in his life
[4236.86 --> 4237.84]  of obedience
[4237.84 --> 4239.94]  and has paid for more
[4239.94 --> 4240.80]  in his death
[4240.80 --> 4242.20]  on the cross.
[4242.90 --> 4244.18]  The Bible says
[4244.18 --> 4245.22]  very clearly,
[4245.68 --> 4247.04]  for he himself
[4247.04 --> 4249.00]  is our peace
[4249.00 --> 4249.86]  who has made
[4249.86 --> 4250.56]  the two groups
[4250.56 --> 4251.64]  one has destroyed
[4251.64 --> 4252.26]  the barrier,
[4252.70 --> 4253.62]  the dividing wall
[4253.62 --> 4254.16]  of hostility.
[4255.22 --> 4257.60]  Jesus is your peace.
[4258.64 --> 4259.22]  Don't settle
[4259.22 --> 4260.28]  for something fleeting.
[4260.74 --> 4261.82]  Don't imagine him
[4261.82 --> 4262.88]  as something less
[4262.88 --> 4264.70]  than what he is.
[4264.86 --> 4265.22]  Instead,
[4265.58 --> 4266.70]  receive in him,
[4266.86 --> 4267.80]  what did Luke say?
[4267.92 --> 4268.50]  A kingdom
[4268.50 --> 4270.56]  that will never end.
[4270.56 --> 4274.48]  this Christmas,
[4274.94 --> 4276.10]  I pray
[4276.10 --> 4277.48]  that you know
[4277.48 --> 4278.52]  the hope
[4278.52 --> 4279.90]  of Jesus.
[4281.00 --> 4281.74]  A hope
[4281.74 --> 4282.52]  that isn't based
[4282.52 --> 4283.30]  on the strength
[4283.30 --> 4284.18]  of your convictions
[4284.18 --> 4285.54]  or some other
[4285.54 --> 4287.22]  unsure optimism,
[4287.86 --> 4288.60]  but a hope
[4288.60 --> 4289.48]  that is fixed
[4289.48 --> 4290.48]  and certain
[4290.48 --> 4291.68]  because of the promises
[4291.68 --> 4292.20]  of God,
[4292.28 --> 4293.54]  because of who God is.
[4294.04 --> 4295.20]  The Bible calls
[4295.20 --> 4296.18]  Jesus Christ
[4296.18 --> 4297.54]  our hope
[4297.54 --> 4298.84]  in 1 Timothy 1.
[4298.84 --> 4301.78]  Jesus is your hope.
[4302.62 --> 4303.44]  And so don't settle
[4303.44 --> 4303.96]  for something
[4303.96 --> 4305.24]  limited to this earth
[4305.24 --> 4306.86]  or to your experience
[4306.86 --> 4307.30]  of it.
[4307.48 --> 4308.62]  Don't imagine him
[4308.62 --> 4309.16]  as something
[4309.16 --> 4310.44]  less than he is.
[4310.78 --> 4311.20]  Instead,
[4311.62 --> 4312.68]  receive in him
[4312.68 --> 4313.38]  the throne
[4313.38 --> 4314.42]  of his father,
[4314.82 --> 4315.16]  David,
[4315.58 --> 4316.18]  a sure
[4316.18 --> 4318.08]  and fixed reality,
[4318.30 --> 4319.90]  an everlasting kingdom,
[4320.12 --> 4321.04]  the restoration
[4321.04 --> 4322.66]  of all things
[4322.66 --> 4323.86]  towards which
[4323.86 --> 4324.36]  we are heading.
[4325.16 --> 4325.98]  That's hope.
[4325.98 --> 4328.76]  And this Christmas,
[4328.92 --> 4329.32]  I pray
[4329.32 --> 4330.24]  that you know
[4330.24 --> 4330.80]  the joy
[4330.80 --> 4331.86]  of Jesus.
[4333.04 --> 4333.44]  A joy
[4333.44 --> 4334.32]  that doesn't pretend
[4334.32 --> 4334.96]  that everything
[4334.96 --> 4335.80]  is happy
[4335.80 --> 4336.94]  or good,
[4337.04 --> 4337.98]  but a joy
[4337.98 --> 4339.22]  that pervades
[4339.22 --> 4340.44]  even the darkest
[4340.44 --> 4341.12]  night
[4341.12 --> 4342.14]  of the soul
[4342.14 --> 4343.02]  because joy
[4343.02 --> 4343.94]  is the only
[4343.94 --> 4345.42]  reasonable response
[4345.42 --> 4346.72]  when God himself
[4346.72 --> 4347.66]  has come down
[4347.66 --> 4348.36]  and death
[4348.36 --> 4348.98]  is defeated,
[4349.24 --> 4350.24]  when God himself
[4350.24 --> 4350.82]  has won
[4350.82 --> 4351.66]  the victory.
[4352.06 --> 4353.12]  Joy is the only
[4353.12 --> 4354.38]  reasonable response
[4354.38 --> 4355.22]  when the tomb
[4355.22 --> 4356.40]  is empty.
[4358.16 --> 4358.70]  And so the Bible
[4358.70 --> 4359.82]  says that Christians
[4359.82 --> 4360.58]  are people
[4360.58 --> 4360.96]  who,
[4361.60 --> 4362.14]  even though,
[4362.32 --> 4363.06]  1 Peter 1,
[4363.14 --> 4364.48]  even though you do not
[4364.48 --> 4365.72]  see Jesus now,
[4366.12 --> 4367.22]  you believe in him
[4367.22 --> 4367.94]  and are filled
[4367.94 --> 4369.38]  with an inexpressible
[4369.38 --> 4371.56]  and glorious joy.
[4372.56 --> 4373.82]  I love that phrase,
[4373.94 --> 4374.88]  inexpressible
[4374.88 --> 4375.94]  and glorious.
[4378.60 --> 4381.12]  Jesus is your joy.
[4381.12 --> 4382.72]  So don't settle
[4382.72 --> 4383.88]  for something inadequate
[4383.88 --> 4384.94]  and that can't handle
[4384.94 --> 4385.44]  the weight
[4385.44 --> 4386.40]  of God's glory.
[4386.96 --> 4388.08]  Don't imagine him
[4388.08 --> 4388.96]  as something less
[4388.96 --> 4390.18]  than what he is.
[4390.32 --> 4390.70]  Instead,
[4391.46 --> 4393.12]  receive him
[4393.12 --> 4394.34]  as the son
[4394.34 --> 4395.72]  of the most high.
[4396.12 --> 4397.10]  Call him great
[4397.10 --> 4398.06]  like Gabriel
[4398.06 --> 4399.42]  and welcome him
[4399.42 --> 4400.56]  as the good news
[4400.56 --> 4401.44]  of great joy
[4401.44 --> 4403.14]  for all people.
[4404.24 --> 4404.94]  This Christmas,
[4405.14 --> 4405.60]  I pray,
[4405.60 --> 4409.32]  I pray that you
[4409.32 --> 4410.82]  know the love
[4410.82 --> 4412.14]  of Jesus.
[4413.24 --> 4414.18]  A love that isn't
[4414.18 --> 4415.02]  self-serving
[4415.02 --> 4416.00]  or about personal
[4416.00 --> 4416.42]  happiness,
[4416.64 --> 4417.64]  but a real love,
[4417.68 --> 4419.22]  a true and better love
[4419.22 --> 4420.94]  that gives of self
[4420.94 --> 4422.14]  because that is
[4422.14 --> 4423.26]  the way of God
[4423.26 --> 4424.24]  and the fellowship
[4424.24 --> 4425.30]  for which we were
[4425.30 --> 4426.40]  created to live
[4426.40 --> 4426.98]  together.
[4428.08 --> 4429.50]  The Bible calls us
[4429.50 --> 4430.52]  in Ephesians 5
[4430.52 --> 4431.72]  to follow God's
[4431.72 --> 4432.20]  example,
[4432.38 --> 4432.58]  therefore,
[4432.58 --> 4434.00]  as dearly loved
[4434.00 --> 4434.52]  children
[4434.52 --> 4435.86]  and to walk
[4435.86 --> 4436.70]  in the way
[4436.70 --> 4437.64]  of love
[4437.64 --> 4439.06]  just as Christ
[4439.06 --> 4439.64]  loved us
[4439.64 --> 4440.34]  and gave himself
[4440.34 --> 4441.08]  up for us
[4441.08 --> 4441.76]  as a fragrant
[4441.76 --> 4442.80]  offering and
[4442.80 --> 4444.46]  sacrifice to God.
[4445.16 --> 4446.70]  Jesus loves us
[4446.70 --> 4448.44]  and has shown us
[4448.44 --> 4450.38]  this true love
[4450.38 --> 4451.20]  and so don't settle
[4451.20 --> 4452.04]  for something other,
[4452.86 --> 4453.76]  something that pales
[4453.76 --> 4454.52]  in comparison,
[4454.78 --> 4455.20]  something that is
[4455.20 --> 4455.90]  just a shadow
[4455.90 --> 4457.40]  of the true love
[4457.40 --> 4458.70]  of God shown to us.
[4458.80 --> 4459.92]  Don't imagine him
[4459.92 --> 4460.84]  as something less
[4460.84 --> 4461.74]  than he is.
[4461.74 --> 4462.30]  Instead,
[4463.10 --> 4464.08]  see in him,
[4464.56 --> 4465.80]  see that he will
[4465.80 --> 4467.36]  reign over Jacob's
[4467.36 --> 4468.76]  descendants forever
[4468.76 --> 4470.16]  with a,
[4470.64 --> 4471.58]  how did we say it
[4471.58 --> 4472.44]  at the O Holy Night,
[4472.90 --> 4474.10]  with a never stopping,
[4474.32 --> 4475.26]  never giving up,
[4475.44 --> 4476.08]  unbreaking,
[4476.54 --> 4478.14]  always and forever
[4478.14 --> 4479.22]  love.
[4481.10 --> 4481.74]  The incarnation
[4481.74 --> 4483.16]  is the beginning
[4483.16 --> 4484.20]  of the good news
[4484.20 --> 4485.22]  about Jesus.
[4485.44 --> 4486.22]  There is nothing
[4486.22 --> 4487.12]  like him
[4487.12 --> 4488.42]  in all of creation
[4488.42 --> 4489.12]  because he
[4489.12 --> 4490.50]  is the uncreated one,
[4490.58 --> 4491.50]  the son of God
[4491.50 --> 4492.44]  who took on flesh.
[4492.86 --> 4493.84]  Nothing like this
[4493.84 --> 4494.74]  has ever happened
[4494.74 --> 4496.04]  in all of history.
[4496.24 --> 4497.16]  No matter how many
[4497.16 --> 4498.04]  internet memes
[4498.04 --> 4499.18]  tell you that Christians
[4499.18 --> 4500.00]  stole Christianity
[4500.00 --> 4500.84]  from the pagans,
[4501.18 --> 4501.72]  they're wrong.
[4505.72 --> 4506.86]  Nothing like this
[4506.86 --> 4507.56]  has ever happened.
[4507.98 --> 4509.16]  There is no comparison.
[4509.94 --> 4510.96]  There is no equal.
[4512.44 --> 4515.24]  Jesus is our peace.
[4515.24 --> 4517.58]  Jesus is our hope.
[4517.58 --> 4518.98]  Jesus is our joy.
[4519.34 --> 4521.26]  And Jesus is our love.
[4521.40 --> 4522.42]  I pray
[4522.42 --> 4523.32]  that you
[4523.32 --> 4524.74]  know that
[4524.74 --> 4525.44]  too.
[4526.50 --> 4527.72]  Merry Christmas
[4527.72 --> 4528.88]  and amen.
[4529.68 --> 4530.50]  Let's pray together.
[4532.70 --> 4533.76]  Lord Jesus,
[4534.32 --> 4535.52]  help us
[4535.52 --> 4536.64]  to see you
[4536.64 --> 4537.94]  most clearly
[4537.94 --> 4538.82]  today.
[4538.82 --> 4542.16]  you have come
[4542.16 --> 4543.20]  down from heaven,
[4543.30 --> 4544.30]  the transcendent
[4544.30 --> 4545.72]  becoming imminent,
[4546.30 --> 4546.90]  the infinite
[4546.90 --> 4548.06]  becoming finite.
[4548.32 --> 4548.84]  You have
[4548.84 --> 4550.36]  written yourself
[4550.36 --> 4552.16]  into this story
[4552.16 --> 4552.90]  so that we
[4552.90 --> 4554.24]  might know you
[4554.24 --> 4555.88]  and so that you
[4555.88 --> 4556.80]  might save us
[4556.80 --> 4557.52]  from ourselves.
[4558.52 --> 4559.52]  And so we turn
[4559.52 --> 4559.88]  to you,
[4560.02 --> 4560.42]  Lord Jesus,
[4560.60 --> 4561.60]  as the only
[4561.60 --> 4562.68]  true
[4562.68 --> 4564.04]  and full
[4564.04 --> 4564.78]  better
[4564.78 --> 4565.62]  complete
[4565.62 --> 4566.48]  source
[4566.48 --> 4567.30]  of peace,
[4567.52 --> 4568.70]  of wholeness,
[4569.60 --> 4570.12]  is the only
[4570.12 --> 4570.92]  true and better
[4570.92 --> 4571.38]  hope,
[4572.26 --> 4572.94]  is the only
[4572.94 --> 4573.50]  true and better
[4573.50 --> 4573.94]  joy,
[4574.40 --> 4575.04]  and is the only
[4575.04 --> 4576.10]  true and best
[4576.10 --> 4578.46]  expression
[4578.46 --> 4580.00]  of love.
[4581.48 --> 4582.66]  May we sing
[4582.66 --> 4583.40]  your praises
[4583.40 --> 4584.48]  this Christmas
[4584.48 --> 4585.36]  and may we
[4585.36 --> 4586.20]  know you
[4586.20 --> 4587.00]  more fully.
[4588.82 --> 4589.38]  God,
[4589.44 --> 4589.76]  whether we
[4589.76 --> 4590.74]  have questions,
[4591.84 --> 4592.38]  whether we
[4592.38 --> 4593.46]  are in the midst
[4593.46 --> 4594.38]  of the dark night,
[4594.50 --> 4595.16]  whether we are
[4595.16 --> 4596.44]  filled with doubts,
[4596.48 --> 4597.88]  I pray that you
[4597.88 --> 4599.00]  would meet us
[4599.00 --> 4600.60]  today in this
[4600.60 --> 4601.70]  space, in this
[4601.70 --> 4602.88]  place, right here,
[4603.22 --> 4604.10]  right now, come
[4604.10 --> 4605.00]  down in the power
[4605.00 --> 4606.22]  of your spirit and
[4606.22 --> 4607.34]  reveal yourself
[4607.34 --> 4607.88]  again.
[4608.28 --> 4609.36]  In Jesus' name
[4609.36 --> 4609.90]  we pray.
[4610.96 --> 4611.36]  Amen.
[4612.58 --> 4612.98]  Amen.
[4612.98 --> 4613.08]  Amen.
[4621.08 --> 4622.32]  Please rise and sing.
[4622.32 --> 4622.88]  Amen.
[4622.88 --> 4623.44]  Amen.
[4623.44 --> 4623.48]  Amen.
[4623.48 --> 4623.88]  Amen.
[4623.88 --> 4623.94]  Amen.
[4623.94 --> 4624.00]  Amen.
[4624.00 --> 4624.44]  Amen.
[4624.44 --> 4624.48]  Amen.
[4624.48 --> 4625.00]  Amen.
[4625.00 --> 4625.48]  Amen.
[4625.48 --> 4626.46]  Amen.
[4626.64 --> 4631.94]  Amen.
[4653.60 --> 4653.66]  Amen.
[4653.66 --> 4654.38]  Amen.
[4654.38 --> 4654.94]  Amen.
[4654.94 --> 4655.70]  Amen.
[4655.70 --> 4669.70]  shame of scandal came the savior of the human race
[4669.70 --> 4683.70]  shepherds listen as the angels tell
[4685.70 --> 4699.70]  king of heaven now a friend of sinners humble servant in the father's hands
[4699.70 --> 4709.70]  filled with power and the holy spirit filled with mercy for the broken hands
[4709.70 --> 4715.70]  yes he walked my road and he felt my pain
[4715.70 --> 4721.70]  joys and sorrows that i know so well
[4721.70 --> 4735.70]  is
[4735.70 --> 4745.70]  through the kisses of a friend's betrayal he was lifted on a cruel cross
[4745.70 --> 4751.70]  he was punished for a world's transgressions
[4751.70 --> 4757.70]  he was suffering to save the lost
[4757.70 --> 4763.70]  he fights for breath he fights for me
[4763.70 --> 4767.70]  losing sinners from the pains of hell
[4767.70 --> 4773.70]  and with a shout our souls are free
[4773.70 --> 4775.70]  and he was
[4775.70 --> 4777.70]  defeated by
[4777.70 --> 4781.70]  emmanuel
[4781.70 --> 4785.70]  now he's standing in the place of
[4785.70 --> 4787.70]  honor
[4787.70 --> 4789.70]  crowned with glory of the
[4789.70 --> 4791.70]  highest lord
[4791.70 --> 4795.70]  he's receding for his own
[4795.70 --> 4797.70]  beloved
[4797.70 --> 4799.70]  to his father
[4799.70 --> 4803.70]  to bring him home
[4803.70 --> 4805.70]  and the skies will part
[4805.70 --> 4809.70]  as the trumpet sounds
[4809.70 --> 4811.70]  hope of heaven
[4811.70 --> 4813.70]  or the fear of hell
[4813.70 --> 4815.70]  but the pride will run
[4815.70 --> 4819.70]  to her father's arms
[4819.70 --> 4841.70]  giving glory to
[4841.70 --> 4853.70]  emmanuel
[4853.70 --> 4855.70]  as you go today
[4855.70 --> 4857.70]  and into this week
[4857.70 --> 4859.70]  we go with the blessing of god
[4859.70 --> 4861.70]  who has come down to us
[4861.70 --> 4863.70]  and who goes with us
[4863.70 --> 4865.70]  before our service
[4865.70 --> 4867.70]  this morning
[4867.70 --> 4869.70]  one of the elders who has been in charge
[4869.70 --> 4871.70]  of coffee service
[4871.70 --> 4873.70]  said we need to do coffee again
[4873.70 --> 4874.70]  after church
[4874.70 --> 4875.70]  and so if you have the time
[4875.70 --> 4876.70]  and the capacity
[4876.70 --> 4877.70]  please be invited
[4877.70 --> 4878.70]  to stick around
[4878.70 --> 4880.70]  for coffee and fellowship today
[4880.70 --> 4882.70]  which should be
[4882.70 --> 4883.70]  assuming everything went right
[4883.70 --> 4884.70]  John
[4884.70 --> 4886.70]  ready to go for us
[4886.70 --> 4887.70]  there
[4887.70 --> 4888.70]  let's

[4895.70 --> 4898.70]  god has come down to protect you
[4898.70 --> 4900.70]  god has come down to support you
[4900.70 --> 4902.70]  god has come down to befriend you
[4902.70 --> 4904.70]  do not be afraid
[4904.70 --> 4906.70]  let the blessing of god
[4906.70 --> 4908.70]  come upon you this Christmas
[4908.70 --> 4910.70]  do not be afraid
[4910.70 --> 4912.70]  but go in peace
