• The word "Philip" in Genesis can be translated as either fallen ones or giants, but the emphasis is on men of renown.
• In ancient times, the term "sons of God" referred to kings and rulers.
• The story of Genesis 6-7 may be talking about evil kings having children who became historically renowned heroes, but were sinful and evil.
• Jude's book quotes Enoch's apocryphal prophecy about a future judgment where God will judge those Philip and fallen angels for their ungodliness.
• The ungodly are described as people who live by their own desires, use violence, abuse power, and do not seek to live in community with others.
• Faith is the key to pleasing God and leads to eternal life, but it must be a faith that leads to repentance and obedience.
• A true faith is one that shows itself through good actions, love for others and God, and a changed behaviour.

• The Holy Spirit regenerates our hearts and minds by grace alone to enable faith
• Faith allows for justification, sanctification, and glorification
• Enoch's story demonstrates faith in God's promise of a future Redeemer who would defeat Satan
• Enoch had direct access to the source of sin through his ancestor Adam and knew about the fall and curses on the serpent
• Enoch's faith was in the promised curse on the serpent, which was fulfilled at the cross
• The cross is seen as the event where the promised son of Eve crushed the head of Satan
• Enoch's reward for walking faithfully with God was being taken by Him without experiencing death
• The speaker explains that the genealogy in Genesis is not just a list of names, but rather a way to illustrate the importance of faithfulness and obedience to God.
• Enoch's story serves as an example of someone who lived faithfully with God, leading to eternal life despite being taken by God before his time.
