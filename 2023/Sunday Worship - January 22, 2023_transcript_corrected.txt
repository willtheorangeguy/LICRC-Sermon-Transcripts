[0.00 → 9.34] That sealed the promise, your buried body began to breathe.
[10.54 → 22.62] Out of the silence, the roaring lion declared the grave has no claim on me.
[22.62 → 36.26] Then came the morning that sealed the promise, your buried body began to breathe.
[37.12 → 49.40] Out of the silence, the roaring lion declared the grave has no claim on me.
[49.40 → 55.40] Jesus, yours is the victory.
[58.16 → 63.40] Oh, hallelujah.
[64.36 → 67.34] Praise the one who set me free.
[67.72 → 68.68] Hallelujah.
[71.08 → 73.40] Dead has lost its grip on me.
[73.40 → 77.44] You have broken every chain.
[77.78 → 80.76] This I may say in your name.
[81.04 → 85.40] Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[87.78 → 88.40] Hallelujah.
[91.04 → 93.40] Praise the one who set me free.
[94.40 → 95.40] Hallelujah.
[95.40 → 96.40] Hallelujah.
[96.40 → 97.40] Hallelujah.
[97.40 → 100.66] Death has lost its grip on me.
[100.66 → 104.16] You have broken every chain.
[104.16 → 107.40] This I may say in your name.
[107.40 → 112.40] Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[113.78 → 119.16] Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[119.16 → 125.16] Oh, God, you are my living hope.
[125.16 → 126.24] Oh, God, you are my living hope.
[126.24 → 126.40] Oh, God, you are my living hope.
[126.40 → 148.96] Oh, God, you are my living hope.
[148.96 → 152.82] The kind that comes from mistakes
[152.82 → 155.78] The kind that won't go away
[155.78 → 157.56] When I turned around
[157.56 → 160.46] They were right there to remind me
[160.46 → 162.20] I've seen regret
[162.20 → 165.96] The kind that messes with your hair
[165.96 → 169.16] The failures and the can't forgets
[169.16 → 170.78] But standing here now
[170.78 → 173.66] I'm thinking God it's behind me
[173.66 → 176.66] Because I've seen nails scarred hands
[176.66 → 179.78] Reach out and wipe it all away
[179.78 → 182.58] Now I see grace
[182.58 → 185.80] Hallelujah, I stand amazed
[185.80 → 189.12] I'm staring at an empty grave
[189.12 → 193.04] And the stone that you rolled away
[193.04 → 197.14] When I was a prodigal, you saw a son
[197.14 → 200.52] When I left the 99, you saw the one
[200.52 → 202.20] And just like that
[202.20 → 205.48] All my past has been erased
[205.48 → 207.22] When I look back
[207.22 → 209.08] I see grace
[209.08 → 212.30] I still hurt
[212.30 → 215.60] Fall short of what you say I'm worth
[215.60 → 218.62] And that devil says I don't deserve
[218.62 → 220.34] What you did on the cross
[220.34 → 221.12] And he's right
[221.12 → 221.88] Because I don't
[221.88 → 223.94] But you did it anyway
[223.94 → 225.52] I see grace
[225.52 → 228.48] Hallelujah, I stand amazed
[228.48 → 232.08] I'm staring at an empty grave
[232.08 → 235.30] And the stone that you rolled away
[235.30 → 240.16] When I was a prodigal, you saw a son
[240.16 → 243.54] When I left the 99, you saw the one
[243.54 → 245.22] And just like that
[245.22 → 248.50] All my past has been erased
[248.50 → 250.26] When I look back
[250.26 → 251.86] I see grace
[251.86 → 253.86] I see grace
[253.86 → 257.82] God's grace
[257.82 → 261.00] Grace that is greater than all my sin
[261.00 → 264.22] Faith God Almighty going to sing it again
[264.22 → 265.86] Oh, grace
[265.86 → 267.60] Grace, grace
[267.60 → 269.46] God's grace
[269.46 → 273.60] Grace that is greater than all my sin
[273.60 → 275.60] I see grace
[275.60 → 277.60] Hallelujah, I stand amazed
[277.60 → 280.68] I'm staring at an empty grave
[280.68 → 283.68] Hallelujah, I stand amazed
[283.68 → 286.68] I'm staring at an empty grave
[286.68 → 290.34] And the stone that you rolled away
[290.34 → 294.86] I was a prodigal, you saw a son
[294.86 → 298.14] When I left the 99, you saw the one
[298.14 → 299.86] And just like that
[299.86 → 303.10] All my past has been erased
[303.10 → 304.90] When I look back
[304.90 → 307.28] I see grace
[307.28 → 310.88] Grace
[310.88 → 312.88] I see grace
[312.88 → 314.88] I see grace
[314.88 → 315.88] I see grace
[315.88 → 317.88] Grace
[317.88 → 320.88] Grace
[320.88 → 322.88] Oh, grace
[322.88 → 324.88] Grace
[324.88 → 331.88] Grace that is greater than all my sin
[331.88 → 333.88] Grace
[337.28 → 338.88] Grace
[338.88 → 354.88] There's a peace I've come to know
[354.88 → 361.28] Though my heart and flesh may fail
[361.28 → 366.88] There's an anchor for my soul
[366.88 → 368.88] I can say
[368.88 → 372.88] It is well
[372.88 → 377.88] Jesus has overcome
[377.88 → 383.88] And the grave is overwhelmed
[383.88 → 389.48] The victory is won
[389.48 → 395.48] He is risen from the dead
[395.48 → 399.48] And I will rise
[399.48 → 403.48] When He calls my name
[403.48 → 405.48] No more sorrow
[405.48 → 407.48] No more pain
[407.48 → 410.08] I will rise
[410.08 → 411.08] On eagle's wings
[411.08 → 413.08] Before my God
[413.08 → 415.08] Fall on my knees
[415.08 → 417.08] And rise
[417.08 → 419.08] I will rise
[419.08 → 421.08] I will rise
[421.08 → 424.68] And rise
[424.68 → 426.68] I will rise
[426.68 → 428.68] I will rise
[428.68 → 430.68] I will rise
[430.68 → 432.68] I will rise
[432.68 → 436.68] There's a day that's drawing near
[436.68 → 440.28] When this darkness
[440.28 → 441.28] When this darkness breaks
[441.28 → 443.28] To light
[443.28 → 448.28] And the shadows disappear
[448.28 → 455.28] And my faith shall be my eyes
[455.28 → 457.88] Jesus has overcome
[457.88 → 459.88] Jesus has overcome
[459.88 → 465.88] And the grave is overwhelmed
[465.88 → 471.88] The victory is won
[471.88 → 476.88] He is risen from the dead
[476.88 → 478.48] And I will rise
[478.48 → 480.48] And I will rise
[480.48 → 482.48] When He calls my name
[482.48 → 484.48] When He calls my name
[484.48 → 486.48] No more sorrow
[486.48 → 488.48] No more pain
[488.48 → 490.48] I will rise
[490.48 → 492.48] On eagle's wings
[492.48 → 494.48] Before my God
[494.48 → 496.48] Fall on my knees
[496.48 → 498.48] Before my God
[498.48 → 500.48] Fall on my knees
[500.48 → 502.48] Before my God
[502.48 → 503.48] Fall on my knees
[503.48 → 504.48] And rise
[504.48 → 508.48] I will rise
[508.48 → 510.48] I will rise
[512.48 → 514.48] Good morning
[514.48 → 517.48] Welcome to church
[517.48 → 521.48] We're so excited that you are here with us this weekend
[521.48 → 523.48] To worship our good God
[523.48 → 524.48] My name is Chris
[524.48 → 526.48] I'm one of the pastors here
[526.48 → 527.48] And myself
[527.48 → 528.48] And Pastor Kevin
[528.48 → 529.48] And a few others
[529.48 → 533.48] Are going to lead in worship together this morning
[533.48 → 535.48] As the few people are yet filing in
[535.48 → 536.48] We have a couple announcements
[536.48 → 539.48] That we want to put in front of you
[539.48 → 541.48] Josh is going to make one
[541.48 → 543.48] So I'm going to invite him to be up and ready to go
[544.48 → 547.48] The first announcement this evening
[547.48 → 549.48] For youth is 2020
[549.48 → 552.48] And so if you are interested in coming to that
[552.48 → 553.48] Or if you are a youth
[553.48 → 555.48] And you are unsure what that's about
[555.48 → 556.48] Talk to Pastor Kevin
[556.48 → 558.48] He will give you all the answers for that
[558.48 → 559.48] Also
[559.48 → 561.48] After church today
[561.48 → 563.48] And I believe the meeting time was moved to noon
[563.48 → 564.48] Brandon
[564.48 → 567.48] Can you confirm Mexico mission meeting at noon after church?
[567.48 → 571.48] And so that's going to happen here in the multipurpose room
[571.48 → 572.48] Sounds good
[572.48 → 575.48] I'm clearly very informed as to what's going on around here
[575.48 → 580.48] So if you are going on our Mexico mission trip in March
[580.48 → 584.48] There's a meeting taking place in the multipurpose room after service today
[586.48 → 588.48] Josh why don't you come and do yours now?
[588.48 → 593.48] So for the young adults we have our Bible study
[593.48 → 596.48] We want to get that restarted up again in the new year
[596.48 → 598.48] So we just want to have a meeting ten minutes after church
[598.48 → 601.48] To figure out when that best works for all the young adults
[601.48 → 603.48] Yeah
[603.48 → 606.48] Josh ladies and gentlemen
[606.48 → 608.48] Room 114
[608.48 → 609.48] Room 114
[609.48 → 610.48] All right
[610.48 → 611.48] Anything else?
[611.48 → 612.48] No
[612.48 → 613.48] Okay
[613.48 → 619.48] On Tuesday is a council meeting
[619.48 → 622.48] And so members of council are gathering together
[622.48 → 624.48] I encourage you to keep that in your prayers
[624.48 → 627.48] As we meet and discern the Lord's will for our church
[627.48 → 630.48] And then finally next week Sunday
[630.48 → 634.48] We are hosting regional cadet Sunday
[634.48 → 639.48] And so that's cadet Sunday for the whole Fraser Valley Cadet Corps
[639.48 → 643.48] If you don't know cadets is a ministry to young boys
[643.48 → 648.48] Where they get together, and they do crafts and projects and Bible studies
[648.48 → 651.48] We are hosting their cadet Sunday
[651.48 → 653.48] And the regional gathering next week
[653.48 → 658.48] And so there's going to be 50 to 70 boys and counsellors
[658.48 → 660.48] As part of our worship next week
[660.48 → 661.48] We are really excited to have them
[661.48 → 663.48] To facilitate that
[663.48 → 667.48] We are going to help provide lunch for them
[667.48 → 670.48] And so we are looking for soup and buns
[670.48 → 673.48] And I know some of you are excellent at making soup
[673.48 → 676.48] And others of you are excellent at buying buns
[677.48 → 680.48] And so there is a sign-up sheet at the back
[680.48 → 681.48] At the connect table
[681.48 → 683.48] Andrew is going to be there
[683.48 → 685.48] Andrew is our head counsellor here
[685.48 → 686.48] And he will get you signed up
[686.48 → 688.48] So if you are able to help in that way
[688.48 → 690.48] By making soup and providing buns
[690.48 → 693.48] That would be a huge blessing to all the cadets
[693.48 → 696.48] Who will come to our worship next week Sunday
[697.48 → 698.48] I think that's it for announcements
[698.48 → 699.48] And, so I'm going to invite you
[699.48 → 701.48] As you are able to stand
[701.48 → 705.48] And we can be gathered into God's presence together
[705.48 → 712.48] We gather in the presence of God
[712.48 → 715.48] And he welcomes us and greets us with his blessing
[715.48 → 720.48] Grace, mercy, and peace to you
[720.48 → 723.48] From God our Father, the Lord Jesus Christ
[723.48 → 725.48] His Son and our Saviour
[726.48 → 729.48] Through the power and presence of the Holy Spirit
[729.48 → 731.48] All God's people said
[731.48 → 732.48] Amen
[735.48 → 736.48] Let's also greet one another
[736.48 → 739.48] Sir
[743.48 → 744.48] Morning Adrian
[766.48 → 769.48] Good morning
[770.48 → 774.48] Our call to worship today comes from Psalm 145
[775.48 → 777.48] I will exalt you, my God and King
[777.48 → 780.48] I will bless your name forever and ever
[780.48 → 784.48] Every day I will bless you and praise your name forever and ever
[784.48 → 787.48] Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised
[787.48 → 789.48] And his greatness is unsearchable
[789.48 → 814.48] Lord, I lift your name on high
[814.48 → 816.48] Lord, I'd love to sing the Lord
[816.48 → 820.48] Lord, I'd love to sing your praises
[822.48 → 825.48] I'm so glad you're in my life
[825.48 → 831.48] I'm so glad you came to save us
[832.48 → 835.48] You came from heaven to earth
[835.48 → 837.48] To show the way
[837.48 → 840.48] From the earth to the cross
[840.48 → 842.48] My death to pay
[842.48 → 845.48] From the cross to the grave
[845.48 → 846.48] From the grave
[846.48 → 847.48] From the grave to the sky
[847.48 → 848.48] From the grave to the sky
[848.48 → 849.48] From the grave to the sky
[849.48 → 852.48] Lord, I lift your name on high
[852.48 → 858.48] Lord, I lift your name on high
[858.48 → 862.48] Lord, I'd love to sing your praises
[862.48 → 865.48] I'm so glad you're in my life
[865.48 → 868.48] I'm so glad you're in my life
[868.48 → 871.48] I'm so glad you came to save us
[871.48 → 872.48] You came from heaven to earth
[872.48 → 873.48] You came from heaven to earth
[873.48 → 876.48] You came from heaven to earth
[876.48 → 878.48] To show the way
[878.48 → 881.48] From the earth to the cross
[881.48 → 882.48] My death to pay
[882.48 → 884.48] From the cross to the grave
[884.48 → 886.48] From the grave to the sky
[886.48 → 887.48] From the grave to the sky
[887.48 → 889.48] From the grave to the sky
[890.48 → 891.48] Lord, I lift your name on high
[891.48 → 892.48] From the cross to the grave
[892.48 → 893.48] From the grave to the sky
[893.48 → 898.14] You came from heaven to earth
[898.14 → 900.72] To show the way
[900.72 → 903.42] From the earth to the cross
[903.42 → 906.02] My death to day
[906.02 → 908.68] From the cross to the grave
[908.68 → 911.32] From the grave to the sky
[911.32 → 916.02] Lord, I lift your name on high
[916.02 → 920.68] Lord, I lift your name on high
[923.48 → 953.46] Lord, I lift your name on high
[953.46 → 955.16] I raise a hallelujah
[955.16 → 961.78] In the presence of my enemies
[961.78 → 967.00] I raise a hallelujah
[967.00 → 973.46] Louder than the unbelief
[973.46 → 978.78] I raise a hallelujah
[978.78 → 984.48] My weapon is a melody
[984.48 → 990.34] I raise a hallelujah
[990.34 → 997.34] Heaven comes to fight for me
[997.34 → 1004.46] I'm going to sing in the middle of the storm
[1004.46 → 1007.30] Louder and louder
[1007.30 → 1009.66] You're going to hear my praises roar
[1009.66 → 1012.98] Up from the ashes
[1012.98 → 1015.98] Hope will arise
[1015.98 → 1018.48] Death is defeated
[1018.48 → 1021.98] The King is alive
[1021.98 → 1032.30] I raise a hallelujah
[1032.30 → 1032.76] I raise a hallelujah
[1032.76 → 1039.02] With everything inside of me
[1039.02 → 1043.90] I raise a hallelujah
[1043.90 → 1050.22] I will watch the darkness flee
[1050.22 → 1055.00] I raise a hallelujah
[1055.00 → 1057.44] I raise a hallelujah
[1057.44 → 1058.44] In the middle of the mystery
[1058.44 → 1060.44] In the middle of the mystery
[1060.44 → 1064.44] I raise a hallelujah
[1064.44 → 1066.44] I raise a hallelujah
[1066.44 → 1068.44] I raise a hallelujah
[1068.44 → 1072.76] Fear you've lost your hold on me
[1072.76 → 1076.70] I'm going to sing
[1076.70 → 1079.56] In the middle of the storm
[1079.56 → 1082.10] Louder and louder
[1082.10 → 1085.04] You're going to hear my praises roar
[1085.04 → 1087.04] From the ashes
[1087.04 → 1090.04] Hope will arise
[1090.04 → 1092.04] Death is defeated
[1092.04 → 1096.04] The King is alive
[1096.04 → 1101.04] Sing a little louder
[1101.04 → 1103.66] Sing a little louder
[1103.66 → 1106.22] Sing a little louder
[1106.22 → 1108.98] Sing a little louder

[1125.58 → 1127.58] Sing a little louder
[1127.58 → 1130.58] Louder than the unbelief
[1130.58 → 1132.58] Sing a little louder
[1132.58 → 1135.58] My weapon is a melody
[1135.58 → 1138.58] Sing a little louder

[1149.58 → 1150.58] Sing a little louder
[1150.58 → 1151.58] I'm going to sing
[1151.58 → 1152.58] In the middle of the storm
[1152.58 → 1153.58] Louder and louder
[1153.58 → 1154.58] You're going to hear my praises roar
[1154.58 → 1155.58] Up from the ashes
[1155.58 → 1156.58] Hope will arise
[1156.58 → 1162.58] Death is defeated
[1162.58 → 1163.58] The King is defeated
[1163.58 → 1164.58] The King is alive
[1164.58 → 1165.58] Heaven comes to fight for me
[1165.58 → 1166.58] Sing a little louder
[1166.58 → 1174.48] I'm going to sing in the middle of the storm, louder and louder.
[1174.94 → 1179.98] You're going to hear my praises roar up from the ashes.
[1180.84 → 1188.26] Hope will arise, death is defeated, the king is alive.

[1199.10 → 1204.08] You're going to hear my praises roar up from the ashes.
[1204.98 → 1212.26] Hope will arise, death is defeated, the king is alive.
[1212.26 → 1217.98] Ere Zion hallelujah.
[1219.54 → 1223.70] Ere Zion hallelujah.
[1225.36 → 1229.50] Ere Zion hallelujah.
[1230.84 → 1235.56] Ere Zion hallelujah.
[1235.56 → 1250.60] This next song is new to our church, though we have worshipped with it in our youth.
[1250.86 → 1252.72] The first few lyrics read,
[1253.58 → 1255.72] Restore to me the joy of my salvation.
[1256.50 → 1258.56] This is the overarching theme of this song.
[1259.02 → 1265.32] A believing heart that has grown cold and desires to be back in a place where God is the centre of his affections.
[1266.02 → 1268.16] As the psalmist in Psalm 13 says,
[1268.80 → 1273.46] But I trust in your unfailing love. My heart rejoices in your salvation.
[1274.26 → 1279.18] As you listen to this song being sung over you, or as you join in, ask yourself,
[1279.78 → 1283.76] How do I experience salvation? Has my heart grown cold?
[1284.20 → 1287.90] Be honest with yourself and with God when you answer this question,
[1288.04 → 1291.94] knowing that Jesus is the author and perfecter of our faith,
[1291.94 → 1295.42] who for the joy set before him endured the cross,
[1295.90 → 1300.18] scorning and shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
[1300.18 → 1322.44] Restore to me the joy of my salvation.
[1322.44 → 1331.52] Take me back to where it all began,
[1331.52 → 1341.50] Where all I ever wanted was your presence,
[1341.50 → 1350.84] How I longed to be there once again,
[1350.84 → 1360.08] I defy, but the world can't burn out and flame,
[1360.08 → 1364.92] Till nothing between us remains,
[1364.92 → 1369.30] My life is an altar too.
[1369.30 → 1379.04] Breathe again on the embers that burn in my heart,
[1379.04 → 1383.60] Come, love, take you back to the start,
[1383.60 → 1388.54] My life is an altar to you.
[1388.54 → 1398.98] Renewed in me a pure and willing spirit,
[1398.98 → 1407.16] Take me back to where it all began,
[1407.16 → 1416.54] Before it all became so complicated,
[1416.54 → 1423.54] How I longed to be there once again,
[1423.54 → 1425.54] How I longed to be there once again,
[1425.54 → 1429.54] Light a fire,
[1429.54 → 1433.54] Let the world can't burn out and flame,
[1433.54 → 1437.54] Till nothing between us remains,
[1437.54 → 1444.54] My life is an altar to you.
[1444.54 → 1452.54] Breathe again on the embers that burn in my heart,
[1452.54 → 1456.54] A love taken back to the start,
[1456.54 → 1463.54] My life is an altar to you.
[1463.54 → 1469.54] God, I'm sorry,
[1469.54 → 1473.54] Please forgive me,
[1473.54 → 1478.54] For when I've gone cold,
[1478.54 → 1482.54] Lord, I need you,
[1482.54 → 1487.54] How I need you,
[1487.54 → 1494.54] To awake my soul and fire,
[1494.54 → 1499.54] That the world can't burn out and flame,
[1499.54 → 1503.54] Till nothing between us remains,
[1503.54 → 1504.54] My life is an altar to you.
[1504.54 → 1510.54] My life is an altar to you.
[1510.54 → 1518.54] Breathe again on the embers that burn in my heart,
[1518.54 → 1522.54] A love taken back to the start,
[1522.54 → 1523.54] My life is an altar to you.
[1523.54 → 1527.54] My life is an altar to you.
[1527.54 → 1552.54] And all the earth will shout your praise,
[1552.54 → 1554.54] Our hearts will cry,
[1554.54 → 1556.54] These bones will sing,
[1556.54 → 1565.54] Great are you, Lord.
[1565.54 → 1569.54] When all the earth will shout your praise,
[1569.54 → 1571.54] Our hearts will cry,
[1571.54 → 1574.54] These bones will sing,
[1574.54 → 1582.54] Great are you, Lord.
[1582.54 → 1587.54] It's your breath in our lungs,
[1587.54 → 1591.54] So we pour out our praise,
[1591.54 → 1592.54] We pour out our praise,
[1592.54 → 1596.54] It's your breath in our lungs,
[1596.54 → 1600.54] So we pour out our praise to you only,
[1600.54 → 1601.54] God I'm sorry,
[1601.54 → 1602.54] I'm sorry,
[1602.54 → 1603.54] It's your breath in our lungs,
[1603.54 → 1605.54] It's your breath in our lungs,
[1605.54 → 1607.54] So we pour out our praise,
[1607.54 → 1609.54] We pour out our praise,
[1609.54 → 1611.54] It's your breath in our lungs,
[1611.54 → 1612.54] In our lungs,
[1612.54 → 1620.54] So we pour out our praise to you only,
[1620.54 → 1621.54] God I'm sorry,
[1621.54 → 1623.54] Please forgive me,
[1623.54 → 1629.54] For when I've gone cold,
[1629.54 → 1630.54] Lord, I need you,
[1630.54 → 1631.54] Lord, I need you,
[1631.54 → 1632.54] How I need you,
[1632.54 → 1634.54] How I need you,
[1634.54 → 1639.54] To awake my soul,
[1639.54 → 1644.54] To awake my soul,
[1644.54 → 1654.54] To awake my soul,
[1674.54 → 1691.54] Are you hurting,
[1691.54 → 1693.54] And broken within?
[1693.54 → 1699.54] Overwhelmed by the weight of your sin,
[1699.54 → 1704.54] Jesus is calling,

[1961.26 → 1975.02] Please be seated
[1975.02 → 1979.78] Please be seated
[1979.78 → 1992.78] Good morning my name is Rob I'm an usher here, and I have an announcement this morning about something that will not happen so since this announcement about something that's going to happen
[1992.78 → 2010.54] So since it's an announcement about something that's not going to happen you don't need to pay attention you don't need to pay attention you can just think about something else instead
[2010.54 → 2017.54] So this morning we are not having a fire drill
[2017.54 → 2039.54] I'm a little concerned about the look on Rich's face he may have something different planned for us, but we are not having a fire drill but what I'd like us to do is think about what would happen if we did have a fire drill what would you do so we'd have the slide that would come up, and then we would the pastor would make an announcement, and then we would exit out the sides
[2039.54 → 2062.54] through the sides here through the sanctuary avoiding going to the back we would exit out through the sides ushers would stand up and attend to the doors and children's worship maybe one of the kids could remind me what do the children's worship kids where do they go how do they exit the building yes
[2062.54 → 2064.54] Vows suitcase the motion please
[2071.54 → 2079.54] rum ah close we want to go towards the street we'll exit out towards the street because a library area is probably
[2079.54 → 2089.54] where the situation would happen so we want to avoid that area, so the children's worship kids would entry would exit out South towards the street
[2089.54 → 2095.60] street which also reinforces the fact that as in here we don't want to be
[2095.60 → 2101.84] going that way we want to be exiting out the sides so we will be having a
[2101.84 → 2105.14] unannounced drill at some time in the future so then we can put all of this
[2105.14 → 2108.36] into practice thank you

[2383.22 → 2384.22] And then I want you to respond.

[2390.94 → 2392.72] Do you think you can hear you up for that challenge?

[2404.72 → 2405.72] That's good.
[2405.72 → 2406.72] Hey, this morning we're talking about a story in the Bible, and I've got a couple questions
[2406.72 → 2407.72] for you.
[2407.72 → 2408.72] I've got a question for you first.
[2408.72 → 2410.72] Have you ever had to wait super long for something?
[2410.72 → 2414.72] Well, I've got time for a couple suggestions.
[2414.72 → 2415.72] What?
[2415.72 → 2421.72] What do you sometimes have to wait for?
[2421.72 → 2422.72] A long line up?
[2422.72 → 2423.72] Like Disneyland or something?
[2423.72 → 2424.72] Yes.
[2424.72 → 2427.72] How about you?
[2427.72 → 2428.72] Waiting for your birthday.
[2428.72 → 2429.72] Good one.
[2429.72 → 2434.72] I've got a bunch of examples on the screen.
[2434.72 → 2438.72] I'm going to ask you guys if you can relate to some of these.
[2438.72 → 2440.72] The first one there is that.
[2440.72 → 2441.72] Somebody said that one already.
[2441.72 → 2444.72] Sometimes you have to wait super long for your birthday.
[2444.72 → 2445.72] Okay.
[2445.72 → 2448.72] The next one is Christmas.
[2448.72 → 2451.72] Sometimes you've got to wait super long for that.
[2451.72 → 2456.72] Have you ever had a game, like a sports game or a soccer game or something that you
[2456.72 → 2459.72] really wanted to play, and you had to wait a long time, like maybe only a week, but you're
[2459.72 → 2460.72] looking forward to it?
[2460.72 → 2462.72] You've had that?
[2462.72 → 2465.72] The next one is how about this for some parents and kids.
[2465.72 → 2467.72] You guys get an allowance?
[2467.72 → 2468.72] Do you think you're...
[2468.72 → 2469.72] No?
[2469.72 → 2471.72] Well, how about your parents?
[2471.72 → 2474.72] Do you think sometimes they're kind of hoping, waiting for payday so they can pay some bills?
[2474.72 → 2476.72] Sometimes you've got to wait for that.
[2476.72 → 2477.72] Oh, yeah.
[2477.72 → 2478.72] You see some head nods here.
[2478.72 → 2479.72] How about the next one?
[2479.72 → 2480.72] How about this?
[2480.72 → 2483.72] How many of you guys are looking forward to this coming in?
[2483.72 → 2485.72] Report card.
[2485.72 → 2489.72] Oh, you don't get those anymore?
[2489.72 → 2490.72] Oh, man.
[2490.72 → 2494.72] I know for a fact that I was never looking forward to that one.
[2494.72 → 2495.72] Okay.
[2495.72 → 2496.72] How about this one?
[2496.72 → 2501.72] Sometimes summer holidays last a long time, and you can't wait to get back to school.
[2501.72 → 2502.72] Is that true?
[2502.72 → 2503.72] I would skip.
[2503.72 → 2505.72] Oh, maybe for some of you.
[2505.72 → 2506.72] Okay.
[2506.72 → 2508.72] Thank you.
[2508.72 → 2511.72] Uh, this one is...
[2511.72 → 2514.72] Oh, I don't know what that one is about.
[2514.72 → 2515.72] It's a video.
[2515.72 → 2518.72] Video games, playing a soccer game or something like that.
[2518.72 → 2519.72] I can't remember what my idea was on that one.
[2519.72 → 2520.72] Okay.
[2520.72 → 2521.72] Hold on with the next slide.
[2521.72 → 2522.72] Don't start it up yet.
[2522.72 → 2523.72] The next one...
[2523.72 → 2524.72] Oh.
[2524.72 → 2525.72] Burgh.
[2525.72 → 2526.72] Okay.
[2526.72 → 2532.72] The next one, I know a lot of people around here have been waiting for this one.
[2532.72 → 2535.72] I know Kevin Robert and myself, we have one of these already.
[2535.72 → 2537.72] Our teams do, but a lot of you guys don't.
[2537.72 → 2538.72] Sam Wynn, Steve Rook.
[2538.72 → 2539.72] The next one is...
[2539.72 → 2540.72] Stanley Cup.
[2540.72 → 2541.72] Stanley Cup.
[2541.72 → 2542.72] A lot of Canucks fans.
[2542.72 → 2546.72] Been waiting a long time for that one to happen.
[2546.72 → 2547.72] How about the next one?
[2547.72 → 2548.72] The next one's a big one.
[2548.72 → 2550.72] How about going on vacation?
[2550.72 → 2551.72] Looking forward to that.
[2551.72 → 2557.72] I'm sure your parents, after a year of work, are looking for a nice vacation this summer.
[2557.72 → 2561.72] And the last one, don't put that one up yet.
[2561.72 → 2567.72] The next show on TV, maybe, possibly parents and kids, maybe you're looking for the next, what?
[2567.72 → 2568.72] What do you guys watch?
[2568.72 → 2570.72] SpongeBob or whatever it is.
[2570.72 → 2573.72] Sometimes parents are waiting for the next show to come up too.
[2573.72 → 2576.72] So, today we're gonna talk about waiting.
[2576.72 → 2578.72] And you have to wait so long for something.
[2578.72 → 2581.72] And today we're talking about in the Old Testament of the Bible.
[2581.72 → 2588.72] There were a lot of words spoken about Jesus coming and the baby Jesus coming.
[2588.72 → 2597.72] And there was a couple of people in the Bible, Simeon and Anna, had to wait a long, long time for them to see baby Jesus come.
[2597.72 → 2598.72] Jesus come back.
[2598.72 → 2601.72] So, that's what we're gonna talk about this morning in children's worship time.
[2601.72 → 2602.72] Alright?
[2602.72 → 2604.72] But first we're going to do the blessing.
[2604.72 → 2607.72] So, let's have everybody stand and face the congregation.
[2611.72 → 2612.72] Ready?
[2612.72 → 2613.72] The...
[2613.72 → 2615.72] Glory to the Lord.
[2615.72 → 2619.72] Glory to the Lord.
[2628.72 → 2629.72] Glory to the Lord.
[2629.72 → 2632.72] Welcome to whoever'sham chapter of the book.
[2632.72 → 2633.72] Our Father suggests the church with God.
[2633.72 → 2634.72] What we're going to do to go beyond the instruction or look at children's worship time is who we are.
[2634.72 → 2635.72] If we're going to do a lot of counselling, we're going to sing each highest.
[2635.72 → 2636.72] The fruit of the Alar among them, they may be creating an imperative chis.
[2636.72 → 2637.72] If we're going to gel aping them a little bit, they're going to be better for you,
[2637.72 → 2638.72] we're going to be better than the same.
[2638.72 → 2639.72] We are going to speak.
[2639.72 → 2640.72] That's the leader of everything.
[2640.72 → 2641.72] There's going to be better as the Shiva family.
[2641.72 → 2642.72] The sacrifice of heaven is a beautiful silence.
[2642.72 → 2643.72] God is my sit down privation left with an animal.
[2644.72 → 2645.72] What are the true love of heaven is to be able to ice.
[2645.72 → 2662.70] Before I lead us in our congregational family prayer, one quick announcement that wasn't
[2662.70 → 2663.38] made this morning.
[2663.98 → 2671.14] Just highlighting this weekend, this downtown, they have Mission Fest, weekend on the 27th
[2671.14 → 2674.04] to the 29th, focusing on discipleship and missions.
[2674.04 → 2678.48] There will be many different speakers to listen to and speak of.
[2678.48 → 2682.50] If there's anyone wanting further information, talk with Fran Skipper.
[2682.50 → 2684.50] She'll be able to inform you more of that.
[2684.50 → 2692.76] But at this time, I'd like to lead us in worship of prayer here.
[2692.76 → 2699.82] Our Father, our loving Father, our patient Father, our forgiving Father, we thank you
[2699.82 → 2702.28] for so many different things, Lord.
[2702.28 → 2707.72] At this time in our congregation, Benita Smith will be undergoing a biopsy at the end of
[2707.72 → 2710.74] January here to diagnose the mass in her bladder.
[2710.74 → 2717.04] Lord, we ask for the guidance and healing in this process and the unknown right now, Lord,
[2717.04 → 2718.72] be with all those who are involved.
[2718.72 → 2725.16] Lord, we think of many others in the congregation who have dealt with recent ailments and injuries
[2725.16 → 2726.18] and surgeries.
[2726.18 → 2730.18] We pray for continued healing in those who are needing in that category.
[2730.18 → 2738.48] Lord, we also think at times of those members of our congregation who are not here, who have
[2738.48 → 2743.58] chosen not to be here, and some who have pushed you out of their lives, Lord, whether it's children,
[2743.58 → 2745.28] family members, friends.
[2746.74 → 2747.80] It's difficult, Lord.
[2747.80 → 2760.36] Lord, I ask that you be with those who are struggling with those issues to outreach and let them know that we are open and willing and wanting them to come to serve with us again, Lord.
[2761.04 → 2763.84] They are missed in this family, Lord.
[2764.24 → 2774.96] Lord, this upcoming week, full council, the elders and deacons will be meeting here, and it's a blessing to be part of this on Tuesday, Lord.
[2774.96 → 2783.16] I do pray that you continue to guide and show us the direction in which you want us to take this church and the work that you've put before us, Lord.
[2783.26 → 2787.90] It's just a blessing to be part of it, and I pray for your continued guidance in this.
[2789.18 → 2800.40] Lord, at this time, I know there are many as well who are seeking employment that has many issues, that can create many issues within marriages and families, Lord.
[2800.46 → 2801.78] We just pay for those marriages.
[2802.30 → 2803.98] We pay for those people looking for work.
[2803.98 → 2814.48] We think of our church right now as we're in the process of trying to find our communications administrator, that you will bring that person and put it on their heart to apply for the position here at Emanuel.
[2815.20 → 2821.00] Lord, we look forward to the upcoming year and the extra help in the office here, Lord, as well.
[2821.00 → 2834.02] Lord, many things are happening here at church, and one thing happening next week that I used to be part of and proud to be part of is the cadet program here at Emanuel.
[2834.52 → 2843.42] Lord, with the coming kids from around the community here in the Fraser Valley, we pray for travelling mercies and look forward to hosting that next week.
[2843.88 → 2845.42] Lord, we pray for so many things.
[2845.42 → 2847.30] All in your name, we pray.
[2847.58 → 2847.88] Amen.
[2847.88 → 2847.98] Amen.
[2847.98 → 2877.04] Good morning, everyone.
[2877.04 → 2883.76] We are going to be continuing our sermon series today on the book of Romans, and I have
[2883.76 → 2888.44] the privilege of walking us through these final verses of Romans 1 today.
[2888.84 → 2894.36] Now, I do find it interesting that last week, Pastor Chris looked at two verses, and I get
[2894.36 → 2895.98] to preach on 14 of them.
[2896.56 → 2900.92] Now, it's probably best that I get this chunk of text, because if Pastor Chris can talk for
[2900.92 → 2904.88] 35 to 40 minutes on two verses, imagine what he would have done with 14 of them.
[2904.88 → 2910.08] But, we are going to jump right in, because there is a bunch to get to.
[2910.16 → 2915.20] So, if you'd open your Bibles with me today, or your Bible apps on your phone, please open
[2915.20 → 2919.76] it up to Romans 1, and we're going to read right where we left off last week, starting
[2919.76 → 2921.54] at verse 18.
[2922.04 → 2925.64] As always, it's on the screen behind me, but I really do encourage you to have that open
[2925.64 → 2928.92] in front of you, because we are going to be going back to this an awful lot today.
[2928.92 → 2931.18] I will warn you this as well.
[2931.28 → 2936.00] While this is a very important text for the framing of this entire book, it's also very
[2936.00 → 2937.16] purposefully bleak.
[2938.18 → 2942.10] Our text is not a particularly happy one today, but it is a pivotal one.
[2942.42 → 2948.04] So, I just wanted to get out in front of that and ask you to join me with open hearts as
[2948.04 → 2948.90] we dig in together.
[2949.10 → 2953.00] So, Romans 1, 18 to 32 says this.
[2953.00 → 2959.90] The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness
[2959.90 → 2965.66] of people who suppress the truth by their wickedness, since what may be known about God
[2965.66 → 2968.86] is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them.
[2969.68 → 2974.10] For since the creation of the world, God's invisible qualities, His eternal power and His
[2974.10 → 2979.20] divine nature have been clearly seen, been understood from what has been made, so that
[2979.20 → 2981.18] people are without excuse.
[2981.18 → 2987.88] For although they knew God, they neither glorified Him as God nor gave thanks to Him, but their
[2987.88 → 2991.70] thinking became futile, and their foolish hearts were darkened.
[2992.56 → 2997.18] Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal
[2997.18 → 3005.18] God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles.
[3006.04 → 3010.76] Therefore, God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for
[3010.76 → 3012.72] the degrading of their bodies with one another.
[3013.30 → 3017.68] They exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshipped and served created things,
[3017.80 → 3020.74] rather than the Creator, who is forever praised.
[3021.34 → 3021.68] Amen.
[3022.44 → 3025.64] Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts.
[3025.86 → 3030.32] Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones.
[3030.32 → 3036.88] In the same way, the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another.
[3037.46 → 3043.18] Men committed shameful acts with other men and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.
[3044.38 → 3048.38] Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God,
[3048.38 → 3055.28] so God gave them over to a depraved mind so that they do what ought not to be done.
[3055.92 → 3060.56] They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed, and depravity.
[3060.90 → 3064.62] They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, and malice.
[3064.92 → 3070.40] They are gossips, slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant, and boastful.
[3070.40 → 3072.68] They invent ways of doing evil.
[3072.82 → 3074.66] They disobey their parents.
[3074.82 → 3080.20] They have no understanding, no fidelity, no love, no mercy.
[3081.46 → 3085.66] Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death,
[3086.20 → 3091.90] they not only continue to do these very things, but also approve of those who practice them.
[3093.06 → 3094.70] This is the word of the Lord.
[3094.70 → 3103.24] Now, right off the top, I'm going to tell you the main purpose of this passage,
[3103.38 → 3108.92] because it's easier to understand as we're walking through it when we're immediately operating with that lens.
[3109.46 → 3115.06] The big idea of this passage is that Paul is showing us how dark humanity has gotten,
[3115.68 → 3121.96] how dark humanity is in order for the gospel truth to shine brightest.
[3121.96 → 3128.92] Again, Paul's dark view of humanity in this passage allows the gospel truth to shine brightly.
[3129.20 → 3130.88] And you see it right away in our text.
[3132.12 → 3135.62] It both opens and closes with how dark humanity has gotten.
[3135.70 → 3136.82] Take a look at both verses.
[3136.96 → 3137.96] Verse 18.
[3138.36 → 3142.74] The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people
[3142.74 → 3145.82] who suppress the truth by their wickedness.
[3146.36 → 3148.04] And then the last verse, verse 32.
[3148.04 → 3152.06] Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death,
[3152.22 → 3156.74] they not only continue to do these very things, but also approve of those who practice them.
[3157.88 → 3162.48] Paul bookends this chunk of text with darkness and with wrath.
[3163.76 → 3167.12] Actually, even the heading to this section of text gives this away.
[3167.20 → 3170.36] If you've got your Bibles open, especially if you have an NIV translation,
[3170.90 → 3172.58] look at the heading of this chunk of text.
[3172.58 → 3176.70] It says, God's wrath against a sinful humanity.
[3178.10 → 3182.22] Now, honestly, sometimes these headings in the Bible can be misleading,
[3182.42 → 3185.04] but I think the NIV hit this one right on the head.
[3185.40 → 3190.28] This is a passage talking about a specific group of people.
[3190.62 → 3192.44] Paul isn't just talking to the Gentiles.
[3192.66 → 3194.36] He's not just talking to the Jews.
[3194.62 → 3196.88] He's not even just talking to the people of Rome.
[3196.88 → 3200.94] He's talking to all of them, to humanity, to everyone.
[3201.80 → 3206.90] Paul is talking to all of us here today about the godlessness and wickedness of humanity.
[3207.58 → 3207.96] Everyone.
[3209.08 → 3210.46] He's doing this for a reason.
[3213.08 → 3217.50] Now, how many of you have studied or looked at the Heidelberg Catechism before?
[3217.66 → 3218.62] You can do this by nodding.
[3219.32 → 3220.12] Yeah, hands, nods.
[3220.14 → 3220.70] Yeah, okay, good.
[3221.40 → 3223.58] We do that here in our church for our youth.
[3223.66 → 3226.48] Actually, the grade 9s and 10s, they look at the Heidelberg Catechism,
[3226.48 → 3228.18] and Nick does an excellent job teaching that.
[3228.44 → 3232.40] Now, the Catechism is a confession that our denomination uses to help us understand
[3232.40 → 3234.52] what the Bible says and what we believe.
[3234.62 → 3241.86] It's divided into 52 devotions called Lord's Days with a total of 129 questions and answers.
[3242.32 → 3245.10] But the whole thing is broken down into three parts.
[3246.10 → 3249.86] The first part is about how great our sin and misery are.
[3250.52 → 3255.50] The second part is how we are set free from that sin and misery.
[3255.50 → 3259.58] And the third part is about how we are to thank God for that deliverance.
[3260.46 → 3265.20] See, the Catechism starts with sin and misery because without knowing how miserable or sinful
[3265.20 → 3273.66] or dark we are, we can't truly understand how great and magnificent and freeing God's grace is.
[3274.74 → 3277.62] We can't know the Saviour if you don't know what needs saving.
[3277.62 → 3284.98] Another example from our culture, actually, there's this English songwriter who goes by the stage name of Passenger,
[3285.06 → 3286.42] and he wrote a song called Let Her Go.
[3287.14 → 3289.28] The lyrics to that chorus teach a similar truth.
[3289.36 → 3291.94] Now, it's not a Christian song at all, but just listen to the chorus.
[3292.40 → 3294.92] It goes, you only need the light when it's burning low.
[3295.14 → 3297.48] You only miss the sun when it starts to snow.
[3297.80 → 3300.04] You only hate the road when you're missing home.
[3300.40 → 3302.64] You only know you love her when you let her go.
[3302.64 → 3303.92] The point is the same.
[3304.02 → 3309.80] You don't realize how important something is or the magnitude of something unless you understand what the alternative is.
[3311.00 → 3315.48] So just like the words of that song and just like the Catechism, Paul gets this in our text.
[3315.64 → 3320.40] In order for him to truly communicate what the light of the gospel is,
[3320.86 → 3326.18] he needs to communicate the darkness and the bleakness that we humans find ourselves in.
[3326.18 → 3329.40] That's why this text is so bleak.
[3330.24 → 3333.72] Because we suppress the truth when we exchange God with idols,
[3333.92 → 3339.32] when we invert reality and replace God with the pursuit of other things.
[3340.00 → 3342.56] All we are left with when we do that is darkness.
[3343.80 → 3347.28] All we're left with, as Paul says, is wickedness and godlessness.
[3347.28 → 3354.40] Verse 18, the wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people
[3354.40 → 3357.66] who suppress the truth by their wickedness.
[3359.64 → 3361.32] Now, our text goes on.
[3361.40 → 3364.90] In verse 19 and 20, Paul points out that the world is aware of God,
[3365.06 → 3367.32] and yet they choose to suppress this truth.
[3367.50 → 3371.32] Now, we call this revelation of God to all people.
[3371.44 → 3373.04] We call this general revelation.
[3373.04 → 3377.88] God generally reveals himself to all people, believers or not.
[3378.44 → 3381.56] And he does so in a couple of ways that our passage points to.
[3381.68 → 3384.76] He does so through creation and through our consciences.
[3385.74 → 3388.64] Now, this passage speaks of creation in verse 19 and 20,
[3388.68 → 3390.84] and our consciences in verse 21 and 23.
[3390.94 → 3394.88] The Belgic Confession, which is another document that our denomination in church uses
[3394.88 → 3398.10] to explain the Bible and teach us about what our faith,
[3398.32 → 3400.36] it also happens to be something that our youth look at.
[3400.36 → 3404.24] Actually, by the way, great 11s and 12s, this is turning into a shameless plug for youth ministry,
[3404.36 → 3405.76] and I am unapologetic for that.
[3406.30 → 3409.62] But the Belgic Confession speaks of general revelation in article 2.
[3410.66 → 3411.38] It says this,
[3411.44 → 3412.94] For we know God by two means.
[3413.02 → 3414.88] Now, we're just going to talk about the first one right now.
[3415.22 → 3419.16] But first, by the creation, preservation, and government of the universe,
[3419.42 → 3422.78] since that universe is before our eyes like a beautiful book,
[3423.18 → 3425.28] in which all creatures, great and small,
[3425.66 → 3428.94] are as letters to make us ponder the invisible things of God.
[3428.94 → 3431.46] Like God's eternal power and divinity,
[3432.14 → 3436.96] as the Apostle Paul says in Romans 1.20, which is our text today.
[3438.10 → 3440.88] So, through creation, God reveals himself.
[3441.98 → 3443.54] But Paul's saying people are ignoring that.
[3443.66 → 3444.80] They suppress this truth.
[3444.90 → 3445.86] They hide from it.
[3446.16 → 3450.14] They choose to believe that this world and everything in it is not created,
[3450.88 → 3452.38] but simply came to be.
[3452.38 → 3455.90] That the laws and the order and the complexity of creation,
[3456.08 → 3459.62] the minutia of an atom and the magnitude of the cosmos,
[3460.10 → 3461.14] simply came to be.
[3461.28 → 3462.80] That something moved.
[3463.14 → 3464.60] How it moved is still a mystery.
[3465.20 → 3467.08] And then everything just started to happen.
[3468.00 → 3470.40] So, instead of glorifying God for creation,
[3470.78 → 3473.36] they suppress this truth.
[3473.50 → 3474.14] They ignore it.
[3474.18 → 3475.96] They try to speak God out of existence.
[3476.14 → 3478.96] They try to ignore the Creator.
[3478.96 → 3480.78] As Paul says,
[3481.10 → 3482.88] they suppress the truth by their wickedness,
[3482.92 → 3485.40] since what may be known about God is plain to them,
[3485.62 → 3487.72] because God has made it plain to them.
[3488.84 → 3489.84] And then in verse 21,
[3489.98 → 3491.76] for, although they knew God,
[3491.96 → 3494.92] they neither glorified Him as God nor gave thanks to Him.
[3495.36 → 3497.18] But their thinking became futile,
[3497.62 → 3500.42] and their foolish hearts were darkened.
[3503.32 → 3506.10] Christians today are often accused of being closed-minded.
[3506.10 → 3508.06] They aren't open to the real world,
[3508.20 → 3509.28] as the accusation goes.
[3509.36 → 3510.76] But Paul is doing something here,
[3510.80 → 3511.80] very counter-cultural.
[3512.80 → 3515.30] He's saying believers are not the ones who are closed-minded,
[3515.48 → 3518.68] but those who ignore the evidence of God are.
[3519.22 → 3520.90] They are the ones suppressing the truth.
[3521.00 → 3523.48] They are the ones living in denial of a Creator God.
[3523.54 → 3524.94] And when we live in that denial,
[3525.64 → 3528.64] it creates godless and wicked people.
[3530.14 → 3532.64] So, the beginning few verses really push that
[3532.64 → 3533.72] and highlight that truth.
[3533.72 → 3536.34] And then, now the next whole middle chunk of our text,
[3536.54 → 3540.26] it teaches us what living in godlessness and wickedness looks like.
[3540.42 → 3544.62] What living in a world where humanity suppresses the truth looks like.
[3545.62 → 3548.42] We're going to hum along in this middle chunk of text here for a bit.
[3548.50 → 3550.84] And like most things in Romans, there's a lot to look at.
[3551.06 → 3552.64] I'm going to do my best to do it justice,
[3552.80 → 3554.34] but also do it in a timely manner.
[3554.50 → 3556.60] So, keep your chins up, keep your arms in,
[3556.72 → 3558.52] buckle up, strap yourselves in, because we're going to go.
[3558.52 → 3561.68] So, first, when humanity, when humanity,
[3561.84 → 3562.70] well, bad start already,
[3563.08 → 3567.08] when humanity stops acknowledging that God is, in fact, God,
[3567.74 → 3569.46] we don't cease to worship.
[3570.18 → 3571.76] We shift what we worship.
[3573.06 → 3576.74] In verse 23, Paul says that people exchanged worshipping God
[3576.74 → 3579.46] for images of mortal men, birds, animals, and reptiles.
[3579.66 → 3581.54] They stopped worshipping the true God,
[3581.90 → 3583.50] but they didn't stop worshipping.
[3583.50 → 3586.68] They just shifted their worship to idols.
[3588.06 → 3590.10] We humans, we must worship something.
[3590.22 → 3592.38] We've been created by God to worship,
[3592.50 → 3594.16] to worship Him, actually.
[3594.50 → 3596.38] But if we choose not to worship Him,
[3596.58 → 3598.16] we will worship something else,
[3598.62 → 3600.32] because that's what we're designed to do.
[3601.52 → 3603.48] The problem is, when we ignore God,
[3603.52 → 3604.44] and we ignore the truth,
[3604.48 → 3605.58] and we stop worshipping Him,
[3605.84 → 3608.12] we fall into godlessness, of course,
[3608.94 → 3609.72] and wickedness.
[3609.84 → 3612.02] We start worshipping things.
[3612.02 → 3614.26] Sometimes even good things.
[3614.46 → 3616.96] We can take good things and make them God things.
[3617.08 → 3618.48] We can take wonderful things
[3618.48 → 3620.44] and make them ultimate things.
[3621.38 → 3624.24] And that inverts the truth again.
[3625.76 → 3628.06] Once people stop worshipping the Creator,
[3628.34 → 3629.98] they start worshipping the created.
[3631.24 → 3633.32] As Paul says in verse 21 to 23,
[3633.44 → 3634.76] that makes fools of humanity
[3634.76 → 3637.74] and causes our foolish hearts to become darkened.
[3637.80 → 3638.60] So here's a question.
[3639.16 → 3640.58] Once this takes place,
[3640.58 → 3642.90] what happens with our morality?
[3644.70 → 3645.62] See, up until this point,
[3645.70 → 3647.70] Paul's been talking about our relationship with God.
[3648.44 → 3650.06] But when we embrace godlessness,
[3650.24 → 3652.28] not only is our vertical relationship,
[3652.42 → 3653.40] if you will, harmed,
[3653.80 → 3655.58] but our horizontal relationships
[3655.58 → 3657.26] with our fellow humanity as well.
[3658.78 → 3660.90] Our morality is affected.
[3661.74 → 3662.38] But how?
[3662.38 → 3664.76] Now remember,
[3664.86 → 3666.72] we talked about the general revelation,
[3666.90 → 3669.96] about how God generally reveals Himself to all creation.
[3670.04 → 3671.30] We talked about that with creation,
[3671.46 → 3673.32] but it also happens with our consciences,
[3674.16 → 3675.74] through our created morals.
[3677.02 → 3678.62] But if there's no God,
[3679.92 → 3681.48] then who has the authority
[3681.48 → 3684.10] to say what is right and wrong?
[3684.10 → 3687.44] It can't be a personal thing.
[3688.52 → 3689.54] Something can't be wrong
[3689.54 → 3690.92] because I claim it to be.
[3691.02 → 3691.72] That's arrogant,
[3691.86 → 3692.64] that's faulty logic.
[3692.74 → 3693.86] If you want proof of this,
[3694.26 → 3696.20] you can test this out today if you want.
[3696.70 → 3697.94] Go on the social mediae,
[3698.10 → 3698.80] anyone you wish,
[3699.02 → 3700.36] and publicly declare
[3700.36 → 3703.90] that you think it was either right or wrong
[3703.90 → 3705.76] to wear a mask during the pandemic.
[3705.76 → 3707.50] And then sit back
[3707.50 → 3710.26] and watch people come a-commenting.
[3712.60 → 3714.10] No matter what side of the fence
[3714.10 → 3715.20] you sat on that argument,
[3715.78 → 3717.52] there is someone sitting on the other side,
[3718.86 → 3720.72] disagreeing and convicted of their morals.
[3720.86 → 3722.52] No, morality cannot be a personal thing.
[3723.90 → 3726.22] But morality is also not a majority thing.
[3726.88 → 3727.50] It can't be.
[3727.58 → 3729.44] History has taught us that over and over again.
[3730.66 → 3733.34] The majority of people thought slavery was fine
[3733.34 → 3735.08] in North America a few hundred years ago.
[3735.08 → 3737.94] So clearly morality cannot be decided by the majority.
[3739.80 → 3741.40] Morality is not a democracy.
[3743.10 → 3744.50] And therein lies the problem.
[3746.12 → 3748.94] Without God revealing himself to all people
[3748.94 → 3750.12] through our consciences,
[3750.58 → 3751.40] without God,
[3751.66 → 3754.64] there is nowhere to locate moral absolutes.
[3755.68 → 3757.72] Not individuals, not groups,
[3758.04 → 3759.58] not in a system or democracy.
[3759.98 → 3762.98] So where do we get our moral absolutes from?
[3765.08 → 3766.66] Quick example.
[3766.76 → 3767.78] When I was heading to the States
[3767.78 → 3769.26] in my pre-Nexus days,
[3769.34 → 3770.60] I was in this border lineup.
[3770.72 → 3771.58] It was fairly long.
[3771.64 → 3773.14] Let's call it 40 cars long.
[3773.24 → 3774.60] And getting a little bit impatient.
[3774.76 → 3775.98] And as I'm sitting in line,
[3776.52 → 3778.40] this spiffy Honda Civic
[3778.40 → 3779.82] drives up in the Nexus lane.
[3779.90 → 3780.24] And I was like,
[3780.28 → 3781.26] oh, I should maybe get that.
[3781.32 → 3782.44] And then at the last minute,
[3782.88 → 3784.40] he juts into the lane
[3784.40 → 3787.62] and cuts in front of like probably a hundred cars.
[3787.92 → 3789.66] All of, most of you groaned right there.
[3790.36 → 3791.12] Well, I'll tell you,
[3791.22 → 3792.82] most of the line groaned too,
[3793.00 → 3793.90] including myself.
[3794.30 → 3795.48] Lots of people honked.
[3795.62 → 3797.04] Two people got out of their cars,
[3797.16 → 3798.60] started screaming all sorts of things
[3798.60 → 3800.48] and showing them all sorts of fun hand gestures.
[3800.86 → 3802.12] And my question is,
[3802.60 → 3805.08] how did everyone in that line
[3805.08 → 3806.20] know that they were wronged?
[3806.20 → 3807.20] Right?
[3811.84 → 3813.20] God's given us a moral compass.
[3813.34 → 3814.36] It's been created in us.
[3814.58 → 3816.04] That's the opposite of evolving.
[3816.20 → 3817.08] If evolution was true,
[3817.14 → 3817.82] he should be praised.
[3817.94 → 3818.86] He got his first.
[3820.18 → 3821.24] Survival of the fittest.
[3822.06 → 3822.78] By that logic,
[3822.94 → 3824.14] bullying and murder would be fine
[3824.14 → 3824.70] because again,
[3824.76 → 3826.28] you're evolving to become the strongest.
[3826.60 → 3828.54] But we all know those are wrong as well.
[3830.08 → 3832.10] There's a fellow by the name of Greg Benson.
[3832.26 → 3833.24] He has a good quote on this.
[3833.28 → 3833.88] He says this,
[3833.88 → 3836.94] Imagine a person who comes in here today,
[3837.06 → 3837.34] tonight,
[3837.52 → 3839.36] and argues no air exists,
[3840.02 → 3842.60] but continues to breathe air while he argues.
[3843.64 → 3844.44] Now intellectually,
[3844.66 → 3845.94] atheists continue to breathe.
[3846.22 → 3847.68] They continue to use reason
[3847.68 → 3849.36] and draw scientific conclusions,
[3849.72 → 3851.86] which assume an orderly universe,
[3852.12 → 3853.84] to make moral judgments,
[3854.68 → 3856.96] which assume absolute values.
[3857.72 → 3859.30] But the atheistic view of things
[3859.30 → 3861.24] would in theory make such breathing impossible.
[3861.54 → 3863.74] They are breathing God's air all the time.
[3863.74 → 3865.22] They are arguing against him.
[3867.16 → 3869.30] When we stop worshipping the creator,
[3869.64 → 3871.12] we invert the truth,
[3871.62 → 3873.52] and we cannot locate morality.
[3874.80 → 3876.30] What people do then
[3876.30 → 3878.60] is they invent their own morality.
[3880.08 → 3882.40] See, humanity either creates rigid systems
[3882.40 → 3884.88] designed to enforce our own understanding
[3884.88 → 3885.86] of God's morality,
[3886.36 → 3889.76] or we redefine the boundaries of God's morality
[3889.76 → 3892.46] to mitigate or even eliminate sin altogether.
[3893.78 → 3896.38] Humanity has become very good at both of these things.
[3897.32 → 3899.30] But these systems are not God's intention.
[3901.66 → 3903.32] When either of these things happen,
[3903.44 → 3906.20] God gives us over to pursue what we desire.
[3906.94 → 3909.16] The word that Paul uses in our text is called
[3909.16 → 3910.22] epithelia,
[3910.32 → 3911.70] which I probably pronounced wrong,
[3911.70 → 3913.18] but it means over desires.
[3913.80 → 3915.52] The things that we want more than him.
[3916.08 → 3919.00] When humanity wants to abandon God's righteousness,
[3919.66 → 3920.84] suppress the truth,
[3921.18 → 3922.86] and chase our over desires,
[3923.42 → 3925.44] the text says God allows us to do so.
[3926.02 → 3928.38] But when God allows us to do that,
[3928.96 → 3929.80] problems follow.
[3931.56 → 3932.76] Again, look at your Bibles.
[3932.86 → 3933.98] In the middle of our passage,
[3934.12 → 3935.10] Paul uses the term,
[3935.24 → 3936.42] God gave them over,
[3936.92 → 3937.60] three times.
[3937.98 → 3940.02] And he lists the things that we chase
[3940.02 → 3941.18] when we abandon God.
[3942.22 → 3943.36] If you've got your Bibles open,
[3943.40 → 3944.14] I really hope you do,
[3944.20 → 3946.30] you'll notice that these three final paragraphs
[3946.30 → 3947.10] of our text,
[3947.20 → 3948.48] they lead with this phrase.
[3948.56 → 3949.78] You can see it in verse 24,
[3950.22 → 3951.20] and in verse 26,
[3951.42 → 3952.78] and again in verse 28.
[3952.84 → 3953.92] And all of these paragraphs
[3953.92 → 3956.34] give examples of what we chase
[3956.34 → 3958.22] when we pursue our own moralities,
[3958.92 → 3959.80] or our own gods,
[3960.24 → 3961.88] rather than pursue God's righteousness.
[3962.82 → 3963.62] And for time's sake,
[3963.66 → 3965.14] we're not going to linger on any of them
[3965.14 → 3965.84] too, too long,
[3965.84 → 3968.26] but there are definitely some things
[3968.26 → 3969.16] that we need to discuss.
[3970.04 → 3970.90] So we'll start with the first.
[3972.04 → 3973.78] The first God gave them over to,
[3973.88 → 3975.10] in verse 24 and 25,
[3975.30 → 3975.50] says,
[3975.82 → 3976.98] God gave them over
[3976.98 → 3979.08] in the sinful desires of their hearts
[3979.08 → 3980.70] to sexual impurity
[3980.70 → 3982.22] for the degrading of their bodies
[3982.22 → 3982.88] with one another.
[3983.28 → 3984.86] They exchanged the truth about God
[3984.86 → 3985.46] for a lie,
[3985.88 → 3987.18] and worshipped and served
[3987.18 → 3988.10] created things.
[3989.38 → 3991.24] They worshipped each other.
[3991.40 → 3993.22] They worshipped their bodies.
[3993.22 → 3995.14] They worshipped sex.
[3995.14 → 3996.66] But not as God intended.
[3997.90 → 3999.46] They obsessed with their bodies,
[3999.58 → 4000.20] with sexuality,
[4000.36 → 4001.28] and degraded themselves
[4001.28 → 4003.06] by worshipping and serving,
[4003.24 → 4003.80] as Paul says,
[4003.88 → 4004.92] created things.
[4006.28 → 4007.20] Now, the Roman Empire,
[4008.20 → 4008.70] I should say,
[4008.80 → 4010.26] that Paul lived in
[4010.26 → 4011.28] had some similarities
[4011.28 → 4012.36] to our culture.
[4012.86 → 4013.54] The Roman culture
[4013.54 → 4015.34] was very over-sexualized.
[4016.12 → 4017.34] Sexual favours were used
[4017.34 → 4017.90] as payment.
[4018.50 → 4019.62] And the pagan world
[4019.62 → 4020.14] was quite hedonistic,
[4020.82 → 4022.48] meaning the pursuit of pleasure
[4022.48 → 4024.18] was a very important principle
[4024.18 → 4024.76] in determining
[4024.76 → 4025.70] sort of the morality
[4025.70 → 4026.94] of a certain course of action.
[4027.38 → 4028.96] Now, I see our world
[4028.96 → 4030.58] as much the same.
[4031.64 → 4033.14] On Instagram or TikTok
[4033.14 → 4034.04] or Pike social,
[4034.16 → 4035.24] videos are made of women
[4035.24 → 4036.28] flaunting their bodies
[4036.28 → 4036.90] all the time,
[4036.94 → 4037.86] and the reason these videos
[4037.86 → 4038.70] are so popular
[4038.70 → 4039.96] is because men in our culture
[4039.96 → 4040.80] are eating them up.
[4041.28 → 4043.08] In our world of TikTok reels
[4043.08 → 4044.12] and OnlyFans
[4044.12 → 4046.26] and the role that social media plays
[4046.26 → 4048.20] in having us compare ourselves
[4048.20 → 4049.06] to one another,
[4050.06 → 4050.92] we are obsessed
[4050.92 → 4052.44] with photoshopping our butts
[4052.44 → 4053.88] and Boxing our faces
[4053.88 → 4054.98] in order to look younger
[4054.98 → 4055.52] or fitter
[4055.52 → 4056.58] or more sexualized.
[4056.96 → 4057.68] That's the culture
[4057.68 → 4058.46] that we live in.
[4059.46 → 4060.52] And this fad only continues
[4060.52 → 4061.48] to invade our world
[4061.48 → 4062.20] and proves
[4062.20 → 4063.22] that we chase
[4063.22 → 4064.66] this over-desire
[4064.66 → 4065.48] of beauty
[4065.48 → 4066.40] and lust
[4066.40 → 4067.72] and sexualization
[4067.72 → 4068.74] in our culture too.
[4071.12 → 4072.72] Paul continues this list,
[4073.12 → 4074.78] focusing on the sexual nature
[4074.78 → 4075.24] of the world
[4075.24 → 4076.88] in verses 26 and 27.
[4077.08 → 4078.64] Now, according to Tim Keller
[4078.64 → 4079.52] and N.T. Wright
[4079.52 → 4080.68] and a bunch of other people
[4080.68 → 4081.92] I read over the last few weeks,
[4082.28 → 4083.14] these two verses
[4083.14 → 4084.18] might be the most
[4084.18 → 4085.48] controversial two verses
[4085.48 → 4087.10] in the entire Bible,
[4087.62 → 4088.62] specifically
[4088.62 → 4089.94] and actually especially
[4089.94 → 4092.66] to the Western culture's eyes.
[4093.32 → 4094.80] It's the longest text
[4094.80 → 4096.60] in God's Word
[4096.60 → 4098.20] pertaining to homosexuality,
[4098.26 → 4099.22] and because of that,
[4099.30 → 4100.18] people target it
[4100.18 → 4101.12] to prove one point
[4101.12 → 4101.66] or the other.
[4102.12 → 4102.76] We're going to read it.
[4102.78 → 4103.38] It says this,
[4103.38 → 4105.20] God gave them over
[4105.20 → 4106.44] to shameful lusts.
[4106.80 → 4107.54] Even their women
[4107.54 → 4109.82] exchanged natural sexual relations
[4109.82 → 4111.12] for unnatural ones.
[4111.56 → 4112.46] In the same way,
[4112.52 → 4113.86] the men also abandoned
[4113.86 → 4115.50] natural relations with women
[4115.50 → 4116.70] and were inflamed
[4116.70 → 4117.92] with lust for one another.
[4118.88 → 4120.82] Men committed shameful acts
[4120.82 → 4121.48] with other men
[4121.48 → 4122.52] and received in themselves
[4122.52 → 4123.26] the due penalty
[4123.26 → 4124.00] for their error.
[4125.96 → 4127.02] Now, regularly,
[4127.22 → 4127.84] these two verses
[4127.84 → 4129.94] are plucked out of the air
[4129.94 → 4130.80] by conservatives
[4130.80 → 4132.96] and used to defend
[4132.96 → 4133.68] their stances.
[4135.46 → 4136.50] What's important
[4136.50 → 4138.06] is seeing these two verses
[4138.06 → 4139.60] in the context
[4139.60 → 4141.12] that we find them in.
[4141.26 → 4142.70] They are part of a list
[4142.70 → 4143.78] of sinful things
[4143.78 → 4145.26] that humanity pursues
[4145.26 → 4146.46] instead of God.
[4147.24 → 4148.20] Seeing these verses
[4148.20 → 4149.14] in that context
[4149.14 → 4150.26] provides some clarity,
[4150.42 → 4151.04] but often not
[4151.04 → 4151.94] the kind we want.
[4152.92 → 4153.94] See, some see this verse
[4153.94 → 4155.14] as saying that only people
[4155.14 → 4156.72] who are sexually active
[4156.72 → 4158.62] against their true self,
[4158.74 → 4159.36] if you will,
[4159.36 → 4159.90] are sinning.
[4160.20 → 4161.00] Others say that Paul
[4161.00 → 4161.72] is talking about
[4161.72 → 4163.60] promiscuous homosexual sex,
[4163.94 → 4164.88] not monogamous
[4164.88 → 4165.54] or committed
[4165.54 → 4166.90] same-sex relationships.
[4167.82 → 4169.72] But both the language here
[4169.72 → 4171.22] used by Paul
[4171.22 → 4172.10] and the context
[4172.10 → 4172.88] of these verses
[4172.88 → 4173.42] themselves
[4173.42 → 4174.90] don't support these claims.
[4176.66 → 4177.62] Paul uses the term
[4177.62 → 4179.56] unnatural relations here.
[4179.66 → 4180.16] He uses the word
[4180.16 → 4181.32] parapushin,
[4181.52 → 4181.98] which again,
[4182.04 → 4183.30] I probably pronounced wrong.
[4184.70 → 4186.38] But sexual relations
[4186.38 → 4187.10] going against
[4187.10 → 4188.42] how God intended.
[4189.36 → 4190.66] Sex was created
[4190.66 → 4191.26] as an act
[4191.26 → 4192.04] for one man
[4192.04 → 4192.84] and one woman
[4192.84 → 4193.80] within the boundaries
[4193.80 → 4194.74] of marriage.
[4196.04 → 4196.68] Without starting
[4196.68 → 4197.56] a whole new sermon,
[4198.16 → 4199.28] sex between two people
[4199.28 → 4200.22] of the same gender
[4200.22 → 4201.32] or between two
[4201.32 → 4202.28] unmarried people
[4202.28 → 4202.98] at all,
[4203.40 → 4204.32] according to the word
[4204.32 → 4204.76] of God,
[4204.86 → 4205.82] found here and elsewhere,
[4205.96 → 4206.58] is unnatural
[4206.58 → 4207.74] in the eyes of the Lord.
[4208.26 → 4208.62] And therefore,
[4208.74 → 4210.04] it fits into this list
[4210.04 → 4212.02] that humanity pursues
[4212.02 → 4212.74] when they abandon
[4212.74 → 4213.86] the idea of God.
[4214.72 → 4215.58] Now, our church
[4215.58 → 4216.22] is not hidden
[4216.22 → 4217.04] from this discussion.
[4217.04 → 4218.02] We've had conversations
[4218.02 → 4219.34] about homosexuality
[4219.34 → 4219.94] at events like
[4219.94 → 4220.70] Roots and Routes.
[4220.98 → 4221.72] We've looked at books
[4221.72 → 4223.04] by Rebecca McLaughlin
[4223.04 → 4224.00] and by Ed Shaw,
[4224.12 → 4224.74] and we've engaged
[4224.74 → 4225.52] in conversation
[4225.52 → 4227.66] about the Human Sexuality Report,
[4228.06 → 4229.46] which was supported
[4229.46 → 4230.68] at Synod back in June.
[4231.30 → 4232.40] One of the other discussions
[4232.40 → 4233.64] we've recently had
[4233.64 → 4234.78] was in our youth ministry.
[4234.96 → 4235.64] Ding, ding, ding,
[4235.72 → 4236.62] ring the bell once again.
[4237.80 → 4238.92] Our youth ministry
[4238.92 → 4239.98] a year or two ago
[4239.98 → 4242.96] had Mary Lee Bauma come
[4242.96 → 4243.98] and speak to us
[4243.98 → 4244.60] on the topic
[4244.60 → 4245.66] of homosexuality.
[4245.66 → 4247.12] Now, Mary Lee Bauma
[4247.12 → 4248.02] is a pastor
[4248.02 → 4249.36] who helped author
[4249.36 → 4251.02] that Human Sexuality Report
[4251.02 → 4252.88] that Synod supported
[4252.88 → 4254.28] a half a year ago.
[4255.12 → 4255.98] She is also
[4255.98 → 4257.22] same-sex attracted.
[4258.32 → 4259.12] She spoke
[4259.12 → 4260.42] about how the Bible
[4260.42 → 4261.34] clearly states
[4261.34 → 4262.32] that sex is meant
[4262.32 → 4263.06] for one man
[4263.06 → 4264.22] and one woman
[4264.22 → 4265.26] within the boundaries
[4265.26 → 4265.88] of marriage,
[4266.26 → 4267.52] and sex between people
[4267.52 → 4268.48] in any other way,
[4269.08 → 4269.54] including,
[4269.66 → 4270.66] but not limited to,
[4270.74 → 4271.48] limited to,
[4271.54 → 4272.56] homosexual sex
[4272.56 → 4273.70] is wrong.
[4273.70 → 4274.78] However,
[4275.78 → 4276.86] she also helped us
[4276.86 → 4278.14] reshape this narrative
[4278.14 → 4279.36] on homosexuality
[4279.36 → 4280.20] in a very,
[4280.46 → 4281.58] very helpful way
[4281.58 → 4283.12] by pointing to three myths
[4283.12 → 4284.48] and three truths
[4284.48 → 4285.54] that are worth mentioning
[4285.54 → 4286.00] right now.
[4286.38 → 4286.86] They're going to be up
[4286.86 → 4287.76] on the screen behind me.
[4288.52 → 4289.44] Myth number one
[4289.44 → 4291.82] is that if you are gay,
[4292.18 → 4293.68] you need to become straight
[4293.68 → 4295.56] in order to love God properly.
[4295.56 → 4297.94] But the truth is
[4297.94 → 4299.14] that if you are
[4299.14 → 4300.18] same-sex attracted,
[4300.54 → 4301.22] you are made
[4301.22 → 4302.28] in God's image
[4302.28 → 4303.74] and are beautiful
[4303.74 → 4304.84] just as you are.
[4307.12 → 4307.82] Myth number two,
[4308.42 → 4309.74] marriage and sex
[4309.74 → 4311.00] are the only path
[4311.00 → 4312.16] to a life of joy
[4312.16 → 4313.14] and freedom.
[4313.32 → 4314.50] But the truth is
[4314.50 → 4316.74] that living a celibate life,
[4316.96 → 4318.04] an unmarried life,
[4318.30 → 4319.06] can be a life
[4319.06 → 4320.22] full of joy and freedom.
[4320.88 → 4321.56] Both history
[4321.56 → 4322.58] and stories in Scripture
[4322.58 → 4323.44] prove this point.
[4323.44 → 4325.72] Finally,
[4326.34 → 4327.12] myth number three,
[4328.08 → 4329.40] some sins are worse
[4329.40 → 4330.06] than others.
[4330.58 → 4331.62] But the truth is
[4331.62 → 4333.86] we are all sinners.
[4335.20 → 4336.94] And it's this third myth
[4336.94 → 4338.00] and this third truth,
[4338.10 → 4338.60] in fact,
[4338.70 → 4339.94] that really springboards
[4339.94 → 4341.22] into this final section
[4341.22 → 4342.12] of our text today
[4342.12 → 4343.88] because the list of sins
[4343.88 → 4344.70] that we pursue
[4344.70 → 4345.54] instead of God
[4345.54 → 4346.74] continues to grow
[4346.74 → 4348.54] in verses 28 to 31
[4348.54 → 4349.30] of our text.
[4349.74 → 4350.60] If you look at that,
[4350.78 → 4351.22] you'll see that
[4351.22 → 4352.54] all the sins listed there
[4352.54 → 4354.74] are on as equal
[4354.74 → 4356.12] a plane as sexual impurity
[4356.12 → 4357.52] and they're considered
[4357.52 → 4358.98] wicked in God's eyes.
[4359.04 → 4359.96] Just look at the list
[4359.96 → 4360.68] that Paul writes
[4360.68 → 4363.00] in verse 29 to 31.
[4363.50 → 4364.36] Sins of greed,
[4365.06 → 4365.42] envy,
[4366.18 → 4366.54] murder,
[4367.38 → 4368.02] strife,
[4368.82 → 4369.32] deceit,
[4369.96 → 4370.46] malice,
[4371.34 → 4371.68] gossip,
[4372.12 → 4372.86] slandering,
[4373.44 → 4373.54] insolence,
[4374.32 → 4374.74] arrogance,
[4375.16 → 4375.80] boastfulness,
[4376.10 → 4376.92] disobedience,
[4377.32 → 4378.32] and lack of loyalty,
[4378.86 → 4379.76] a lack of love,
[4380.36 → 4381.74] and a lack of mercy.
[4381.74 → 4382.68] It's almost like Paul
[4382.68 → 4384.14] thought he was running
[4384.14 → 4384.70] out of time
[4384.70 → 4385.36] when he was writing
[4385.36 → 4385.82] this letter
[4385.82 → 4386.56] and he says this,
[4386.86 → 4387.56] all of this,
[4388.06 → 4389.46] all of this is bad.
[4390.92 → 4394.08] All of these are shameful lusts.
[4395.28 → 4396.70] All of these are things
[4396.70 → 4397.84] that humanity pursues
[4397.84 → 4399.00] when they surpass truth
[4399.00 → 4401.82] and they suppress God
[4401.82 → 4403.40] and all of it
[4403.40 → 4404.34] is disgraceful.
[4406.52 → 4407.78] So quickly tying this
[4407.78 → 4408.20] all together,
[4408.30 → 4408.90] let's circle back
[4408.90 → 4410.36] to the homosexuality discussion
[4410.36 → 4411.24] for just one second.
[4411.34 → 4412.34] There are two ways
[4412.34 → 4413.30] to misunderstand
[4413.30 → 4415.46] verses 26 and 27
[4415.46 → 4416.32] of our text today.
[4416.62 → 4417.74] I'm going to be paraphrasing
[4417.74 → 4418.98] Tim Keller with these points.
[4420.08 → 4420.66] That is this,
[4420.74 → 4421.36] the first is,
[4421.44 → 4422.76] in an effort to appear relevant
[4422.76 → 4424.06] to the surrounding culture
[4424.06 → 4424.84] and to seem loving
[4424.84 → 4425.48] and welcoming
[4425.48 → 4427.70] to the LGBTQ plus community,
[4428.14 → 4429.38] some people have downplayed
[4429.38 → 4430.10] or even denied
[4430.10 → 4431.24] the teaching of scripture
[4431.24 → 4433.54] on homosexual sex,
[4434.54 → 4435.82] such as this text.
[4435.82 → 4437.64] We might call this
[4437.64 → 4438.74] the progressive approach.
[4439.74 → 4440.02] However,
[4440.12 → 4440.94] the second way
[4440.94 → 4442.30] is that others
[4442.30 → 4443.32] take the Bible
[4443.32 → 4444.82] and take what the Bible
[4444.82 → 4446.32] says on homosexuality
[4446.32 → 4447.12] very seriously
[4447.12 → 4449.58] but in a self-righteous way.
[4450.16 → 4451.34] They do not seek to love
[4451.34 → 4452.46] or welcome gay people
[4452.46 → 4452.92] at all.
[4453.64 → 4454.68] They may seek to love
[4454.68 → 4455.58] their Hindu neighbours
[4455.58 → 4456.44] or their friends
[4456.44 → 4457.54] who are committing adultery
[4457.54 → 4459.22] but not homosexual people.
[4460.30 → 4461.30] We might call this
[4461.30 → 4462.36] the conservative approach.
[4462.36 → 4464.56] But Paul,
[4464.78 → 4465.60] in our text,
[4465.76 → 4467.20] is doing neither.
[4468.48 → 4469.08] He is clear
[4469.08 → 4470.26] that homosexual sex
[4470.26 → 4470.92] is a sin
[4470.92 → 4472.20] but so are a lot
[4472.20 → 4472.96] of other things.
[4474.54 → 4475.32] And so many
[4475.32 → 4475.96] of those things
[4475.96 → 4477.12] strike a lot closer
[4477.12 → 4477.52] to home
[4477.52 → 4478.16] for most of us
[4478.16 → 4478.84] listening today
[4478.84 → 4480.00] like slander
[4480.00 → 4480.66] or envy
[4480.66 → 4481.34] or greed
[4481.34 → 4482.32] or disobedience.
[4485.36 → 4486.32] So if you see
[4486.32 → 4487.54] homosexual sex
[4487.54 → 4488.70] as an act of perversion
[4488.70 → 4490.38] but you don't see
[4490.38 → 4490.90] deceit
[4490.90 → 4492.32] or gospel
[4492.32 → 4493.16] or gospel,
[4493.16 → 4493.50] sorry,
[4493.62 → 4494.10] that's terrible.
[4494.38 → 4495.04] If you don't see
[4495.04 → 4495.58] deceit
[4495.58 → 4496.66] or gossip,
[4497.22 → 4498.12] that's the word,
[4498.86 → 4499.80] or boasting
[4499.80 → 4501.62] or obsessing
[4501.62 → 4502.18] over money
[4502.18 → 4503.52] as equally perverse,
[4504.76 → 4505.72] then Paul is using
[4505.72 → 4507.10] verses 29 to 31
[4507.10 → 4508.22] here to wake you up,
[4508.74 → 4509.42] to shake us
[4509.42 → 4510.02] a little bit
[4510.02 → 4511.02] because here's
[4511.02 → 4511.72] the truth, church,
[4511.90 → 4512.62] and hear this.
[4513.46 → 4515.46] We can only grasp
[4515.46 → 4517.02] the light
[4517.02 → 4517.82] of the gospel
[4517.82 → 4520.00] when we understand,
[4520.00 → 4521.16] just as Paul did
[4521.16 → 4522.76] in 1 Timothy 1.15,
[4523.32 → 4524.58] that we are
[4524.58 → 4525.62] the worst sinner
[4525.62 → 4526.16] we know.
[4527.52 → 4529.32] We can only grasp
[4529.32 → 4530.14] the light
[4530.14 → 4530.72] of the gospel
[4530.72 → 4531.68] when we understand
[4531.68 → 4532.78] that we are
[4532.78 → 4533.62] the worst sinner
[4533.62 → 4534.52] we know.
[4535.76 → 4536.76] And that brings us
[4536.76 → 4537.46] to the final point
[4537.46 → 4538.02] of this message
[4538.02 → 4538.44] where we're going
[4538.44 → 4539.22] to land this plane,
[4539.32 → 4539.82] so to speak.
[4540.40 → 4541.04] What do we do
[4541.04 → 4542.04] with a text like this?
[4543.46 → 4544.88] This text teaches us
[4544.88 → 4546.18] that sin has permeated
[4546.18 → 4546.70] everywhere.
[4547.22 → 4548.24] Humanity has made
[4548.24 → 4549.46] a habit of suppressing
[4549.46 → 4550.00] the truth
[4550.00 → 4550.94] that is our God.
[4551.24 → 4551.84] Sin is everywhere.
[4553.06 → 4553.90] Though not everything
[4553.90 → 4556.14] we do is totally sinful,
[4556.72 → 4557.80] nothing we do
[4557.80 → 4559.36] is completely untouched
[4559.36 → 4559.98] by sin.
[4560.68 → 4561.30] Double negative,
[4561.50 → 4561.86] but true.
[4563.38 → 4563.90] Theologically,
[4564.08 → 4564.52] we call this
[4564.52 → 4565.40] total depravity,
[4565.78 → 4568.36] and Paul calls this
[4568.36 → 4569.24] godlessness
[4569.24 → 4570.56] and wickedness.
[4571.42 → 4572.40] This is more than
[4572.40 → 4573.38] just the fall of man
[4573.38 → 4574.50] because saying humanity
[4574.50 → 4574.96] fell,
[4576.10 → 4577.38] it lacks agency.
[4577.76 → 4578.86] It lacks mankind's
[4578.86 → 4579.76] role in sin.
[4580.10 → 4580.76] Sin is more than
[4580.76 → 4581.48] a fall.
[4582.42 → 4583.20] Sin is rebellion.
[4584.10 → 4585.28] It is a rebellion
[4585.28 → 4586.12] against God
[4586.12 → 4586.84] and a rebellion
[4586.84 → 4587.76] against truth.
[4588.52 → 4590.04] So how do we respond
[4590.04 → 4591.94] to this dark view
[4591.94 → 4592.54] of humanity?
[4592.70 → 4593.56] How do we get out?
[4595.76 → 4596.62] We don't.
[4598.58 → 4599.36] We don't.
[4599.36 → 4602.20] Because God does.
[4604.00 → 4605.32] Because God did.
[4605.80 → 4607.10] God sent his son
[4607.10 → 4609.10] to live a righteous life,
[4609.18 → 4610.34] a perfect life,
[4610.42 → 4611.32] not suppressing
[4611.32 → 4612.62] the truth of the law,
[4612.84 → 4613.90] but living it out
[4613.90 → 4614.84] in perfection.
[4615.28 → 4617.12] His life brought him
[4617.12 → 4617.92] to the cross
[4617.92 → 4619.16] where he took on
[4619.16 → 4620.50] all the wickedness
[4620.50 → 4621.14] of the world
[4621.14 → 4622.42] that Paul just laid out
[4622.42 → 4623.58] so clearly for us,
[4623.66 → 4624.32] and he took it
[4624.32 → 4624.94] on his shoulders,
[4625.14 → 4625.96] and he bore it
[4625.96 → 4626.62] on himself,
[4626.80 → 4627.74] and he died.
[4627.74 → 4629.54] And he took that sin,
[4629.62 → 4630.80] and he took that wickedness
[4630.80 → 4631.76] with him to the tomb
[4631.76 → 4632.70] where three days later
[4632.70 → 4633.30] he awoke,
[4633.58 → 4635.16] and he rose from the dead,
[4635.30 → 4636.56] and he's defeated sin
[4636.56 → 4637.78] and death once and for all
[4637.78 → 4638.22] and is sitting
[4638.22 → 4639.32] at the right hand of God
[4639.32 → 4640.18] right now.
[4640.24 → 4641.40] And now salvation
[4641.40 → 4642.96] is available
[4642.96 → 4644.72] for all who believe
[4644.72 → 4645.36] in that truth,
[4645.60 → 4646.46] for all who don't
[4646.46 → 4647.38] suppress that
[4647.38 → 4648.40] but believe it.
[4649.18 → 4650.10] So nothing,
[4650.98 → 4652.50] there is nothing
[4652.50 → 4653.28] we can do
[4653.28 → 4654.76] because Jesus
[4654.76 → 4656.60] did everything.
[4657.74 → 4659.34] when it comes
[4659.34 → 4660.00] to salvation,
[4660.34 → 4661.46] we do not deserve it.
[4661.56 → 4662.48] We cannot attain it
[4662.48 → 4662.96] ourselves,
[4663.10 → 4664.20] nor can we earn it
[4664.20 → 4664.96] in any way.
[4665.80 → 4667.30] We only receive it
[4667.30 → 4668.08] through Christ,
[4668.48 → 4669.06] our King.
[4669.12 → 4670.12] We can receive
[4670.12 → 4671.38] this gift of salvation
[4671.38 → 4673.08] when God reveals
[4673.08 → 4674.24] the truth of it
[4674.24 → 4674.88] to us.
[4675.96 → 4677.14] And when he reveals
[4677.14 → 4677.98] that truth to us,
[4678.04 → 4678.18] well,
[4679.48 → 4680.60] you can do nothing
[4680.60 → 4681.42] but accept it
[4681.42 → 4683.60] because the truth
[4683.60 → 4684.60] of God's grace
[4684.60 → 4686.18] through Jesus
[4686.18 → 4687.88] shines so brightly
[4687.88 → 4688.76] in this world
[4688.76 → 4690.52] that is full of darkness.
[4691.02 → 4692.46] We must draw out
[4692.46 → 4694.18] any self-righteous pride
[4694.18 → 4695.48] that we are good
[4695.48 → 4696.50] or better than others
[4696.50 → 4697.22] and acknowledge
[4697.22 → 4697.90] once again
[4697.90 → 4699.08] that we are
[4699.08 → 4700.32] the worst sinners
[4700.32 → 4700.84] we know.
[4702.16 → 4703.64] I am the worst sinner
[4703.64 → 4704.16] I know.
[4704.28 → 4705.30] You are the worst sinner
[4705.30 → 4705.80] you know.
[4706.72 → 4708.20] And all of us
[4708.20 → 4709.98] need the salvation
[4709.98 → 4710.62] of God
[4710.62 → 4711.88] found in Christ's life,
[4712.04 → 4712.28] death,
[4712.36 → 4712.94] and resurrection.
[4713.14 → 4713.92] Your debt is paid
[4713.92 → 4714.48] through Jesus.
[4714.48 → 4716.22] You are saved
[4716.22 → 4717.64] through Jesus
[4717.64 → 4718.56] because of Jesus.
[4718.82 → 4719.40] You do not need
[4719.40 → 4720.70] to fear God's wrath
[4720.70 → 4721.58] if you believe
[4721.58 → 4722.06] in the truth
[4722.06 → 4724.20] of the gospel
[4724.20 → 4724.92] of Jesus Christ
[4724.92 → 4726.24] because you have
[4726.24 → 4727.74] received the righteousness
[4727.74 → 4729.32] from Jesus.
[4731.02 → 4732.32] When God reveals
[4732.32 → 4733.42] himself to us
[4733.42 → 4734.36] and saves us
[4734.36 → 4735.04] from the darkness,
[4736.04 → 4737.88] we revert
[4737.88 → 4739.26] back to the truth
[4739.26 → 4740.86] and we understand
[4740.86 → 4741.54] that God
[4741.54 → 4743.04] is truth.
[4743.04 → 4744.50] that's where
[4744.50 → 4745.32] Paul's letter
[4745.32 → 4745.96] to the Romans
[4745.96 → 4746.58] is going.
[4747.68 → 4748.62] That's why we need
[4748.62 → 4749.26] to understand
[4749.26 → 4750.08] the dark side
[4750.08 → 4750.60] of humanity
[4750.60 → 4751.64] because only then
[4751.64 → 4752.80] does the gospel truth
[4752.80 → 4753.70] of Christ's life,
[4754.08 → 4754.32] death,
[4754.32 → 4755.36] and resurrection
[4755.36 → 4756.32] shine.
[4756.98 → 4757.80] Only then
[4757.80 → 4758.44] does the grace
[4758.44 → 4759.00] of our Lord
[4759.00 → 4759.52] and Saviour
[4759.52 → 4760.82] truly mean
[4760.82 → 4761.42] something.
[4761.54 → 4762.14] When we see
[4762.14 → 4762.84] the darkness,
[4763.32 → 4764.44] the gospel truth
[4764.44 → 4765.34] of Jesus
[4765.34 → 4766.52] shines
[4766.52 → 4768.24] because there
[4768.24 → 4768.94] is no other
[4768.94 → 4769.30] name
[4769.30 → 4770.38] that has
[4770.38 → 4770.84] the power
[4770.84 → 4771.48] to save
[4771.48 → 4772.52] but Jesus
[4772.52 → 4773.12] Christ,
[4773.56 → 4774.06] the Lord.
[4774.14 → 4774.38] Amen?
[4775.38 → 4776.08] Let me pray.
[4781.86 → 4782.90] Holy God,
[4783.90 → 4785.26] we
[4785.26 → 4787.88] could not
[4787.88 → 4788.38] be more
[4788.38 → 4789.00] indebted
[4789.00 → 4790.58] to Jesus
[4790.58 → 4791.02] Christ,
[4791.12 → 4791.72] our Saviour,
[4792.44 → 4793.56] who took
[4793.56 → 4794.32] on the sin
[4794.32 → 4794.94] and wickedness
[4794.94 → 4795.66] of this world
[4795.66 → 4797.46] and bore it
[4797.46 → 4798.16] on himself
[4798.16 → 4799.62] and atoned
[4799.62 → 4800.18] for all
[4800.18 → 4800.92] of our sins.
[4802.04 → 4802.56] Lord,
[4802.62 → 4803.56] we do nothing
[4803.56 → 4804.88] to achieve
[4804.88 → 4805.60] our salvation
[4805.60 → 4808.20] except sin
[4808.20 → 4810.24] which causes
[4810.24 → 4811.06] us to need it.
[4813.34 → 4813.88] Lord,
[4813.96 → 4814.82] allow us
[4814.82 → 4815.48] to see
[4815.48 → 4816.16] the darkness
[4816.16 → 4817.50] that this world
[4817.50 → 4817.84] is in.
[4817.94 → 4818.36] Allow us
[4818.36 → 4818.66] to see
[4818.66 → 4819.22] the darkness
[4819.22 → 4820.30] that we
[4820.30 → 4820.88] are in.
[4822.38 → 4823.10] But more
[4823.10 → 4823.52] than that,
[4823.56 → 4823.72] God,
[4823.76 → 4824.34] allow us
[4824.34 → 4824.64] to see
[4824.64 → 4825.28] the light
[4825.28 → 4826.12] that is
[4826.12 → 4826.92] your gospel.
[4827.22 → 4827.54] Allow us
[4827.54 → 4827.80] to see
[4827.80 → 4828.42] the truth
[4828.42 → 4829.18] that is
[4829.18 → 4829.56] in your
[4829.56 → 4829.94] name.
[4830.12 → 4830.56] Allow us
[4830.56 → 4831.20] to see
[4831.20 → 4832.04] that you
[4832.04 → 4832.46] are the
[4832.46 → 4832.88] creator,
[4833.04 → 4833.34] God,
[4833.72 → 4834.24] the king
[4834.24 → 4834.56] of the
[4834.56 → 4834.88] universe,
[4835.16 → 4835.78] the saviour
[4835.78 → 4836.48] of all
[4836.48 → 4836.90] things.
[4837.40 → 4838.12] And allow
[4838.12 → 4838.40] us,
[4838.56 → 4838.72] Lord,
[4839.12 → 4840.12] to be
[4840.12 → 4840.84] drawn to
[4840.84 → 4841.14] you,
[4842.10 → 4842.72] drawn to
[4842.72 → 4843.24] the truth.
[4844.68 → 4845.20] Not get
[4845.20 → 4846.02] bogged down
[4846.02 → 4846.72] by the sin
[4846.72 → 4849.64] but confess
[4849.64 → 4850.40] and repent
[4850.40 → 4850.90] and turn
[4850.90 → 4851.30] to you.
[4852.20 → 4852.42] Lord,
[4852.48 → 4852.78] may we
[4852.78 → 4853.14] know
[4853.14 → 4853.94] that no
[4853.94 → 4854.46] other name
[4854.46 → 4854.86] has the
[4854.86 → 4855.34] power to
[4855.34 → 4856.00] save but
[4856.00 → 4857.36] Jesus Christ.
[4857.90 → 4858.14] Amen.
[4876.72 → 4878.34] who'd
[4878.34 → 4879.26] be
[4879.26 → 4879.50] that
[4879.50 → 4880.48] own
[4880.48 → 4893.84] has the
[4893.84 → 4894.26] enemy
[4894.26 → 4895.96] who
[4895.96 → 4897.50] have
[4897.50 → 4898.30] parts
[4898.30 → 4898.80] on
[4898.80 → 4900.12] miracles
[4900.30 → 4901.86] earth
[4901.86 → 4902.32] and
[4902.32 → 4902.76] various
[4902.76 → 4903.46] peoples
[4903.46 → 4905.58] we
[4905.58 → 4906.54] see
[4906.54 → 4915.60] He who rejoiced to know Thee, renew before Thy throne.
[4915.60 → 4925.80] The solemn pledge we owe Thee to go and make Thee known.
[4925.80 → 4941.80] Where other lords beside Thee, O there I'm in display.
[4941.80 → 4951.80] Where forces that defy Thee still today.
[4951.80 → 4961.80] With none to heed their crying For life and love and light.
[4961.80 → 4971.80] Unnumbered souls are dying And passed into the night.
[4971.80 → 4981.80] We go to all the world With kingdom hope unfurled.
[4981.80 → 4991.80] No other name that's bound to save But Jesus Christ the Lord.
[4991.80 → 5007.80] We bear the torch that flaming Fell from the hands of those
[5007.80 → 5017.80] Who gave their lives proclaiming That Jesus died and rose.
[5017.80 → 5026.80] Ours is the same commission The same blood message ours.
[5026.80 → 5036.80] But by the same ambition To Thee we yield our power.
