[0.00 → 5.18] Breaking in a stable for a throne.
[6.64 → 12.26] If I were a wise man, I would travel far.
[13.18 → 19.06] If I were a shepherd, I would do my part.
[19.28 → 25.40] Poor as I am, I would give to him my heart.
[25.40 → 32.12] And he shall reign forevermore, forevermore.
[32.60 → 38.84] And he shall reign forevermore, forevermore.

[52.18 → 56.42] Here within the manger lies.
[56.72 → 59.74] The one who built the starry skies.
[60.06 → 62.92] This baby born for sacrifice.
[63.70 → 65.70] Christ our Messiah.
[66.70 → 69.82] To our hopes and to our fears.
[70.08 → 73.14] The Saviour of the world appears.
[73.38 → 76.58] The promise of eternal years.
[76.98 → 79.18] Christ our Messiah.
[79.18 → 88.68] The King of kings, the."
[89.36 → 90.74] The King of kings, the Israel of kings.
[91.14 → 93.56] Praise the Lord of kings, the Israel of kings.

[99.08 → 105.90] And he shall reign forevermore, forevermore
[105.90 → 109.48] A child is born to us, a child is born

[694.06 → 696.06] Thank you.
[696.06 → 698.06] Thank you.
[698.06 → 704.62] Glory in the highest
[704.62 → 709.42] Glory to you
[709.42 → 715.52] Glory to you, O God
[728.06 → 758.04] Glory to you, O God
[758.06 → 788.04] Glory to you, O God
[788.06 → 798.06] I don't have Christ the Lord
[798.06 → 807.72] So let's say you want to describe the feeling of anticipating a future that's better than the present.
[807.72 → 814.04] You might be giddy or excited or maybe unsure, but most of us know that experience. We call it hope.
[814.34 → 818.14] It's a state of anticipation, and it's crucial for healthy human existence.
[818.58 → 821.18] And it's a really important concept in the Bible.
[821.54 → 826.46] In fact, there are many words for hope in the ancient languages of the Bible, and they're all fascinating.
[826.46 → 830.52] In the Old Testament, there are two main Hebrew words translated as hope.
[830.80 → 833.94] The first is racial, which means simply to wait for.
[834.40 → 839.76] Like in the story of Noah and the Ark, as the floodwaters recede, Noah had to racial for weeks.
[840.00 → 843.06] The other Hebrew word is naval, which also means to wait.
[843.26 → 846.30] It's related to the Hebrew word KAV, which means cord.
[846.30 → 851.32] When you pull a KAV tight, you produce a state of tension until there's release.
[851.64 → 856.40] That's naval, the feeling of tension and expectation while you wait for something to happen.
[856.84 → 862.02] The prophet Isaiah depicts God as a farmer who plants vines and kayaks for good grapes.
[862.32 → 868.78] Or the prophet Micah talks about farmers who both naval and racial for morning dew to give moisture to the land.
[868.78 → 872.56] So in biblical Hebrew, hope is about waiting or expectation.
[873.24 → 874.44] But waiting for what?
[874.86 → 878.70] In the period of Israel's prophets, as the nation was sinking into self-destruction,
[878.86 → 884.66] Isaiah said, at this moment, the Lord's hiding his face from Israel, so I will naval for him.
[885.10 → 889.02] The only hope Isaiah had in those dark days was the hope for God himself.
[889.50 → 894.90] You find this same notion of hope all over the book of Psalms, where these words appear over 40 times.
[894.90 → 898.48] In almost every case, what people are waiting for is God.
[898.48 → 902.48] Like in Psalm 130, the poet cries out from a pit of despair,
[902.76 → 909.68] I naval for the Lord, let Israel racial for the Lord, because he's loyal and will redeem Israel from its sins.
[909.92 → 913.84] Biblical hope is based on a person, which makes it different from optimism.
[914.22 → 919.76] Optimism is about choosing to see, in any situation, how circumstances could work out for the best.
[919.92 → 922.26] But biblical hope is not focused on circumstances.
[922.26 → 927.18] In fact, hopeful people in the Bible often recognize there's no evidence things will get better.
[927.18 → 929.18] But you choose hope anyway.
[929.18 → 930.54] Like the prophet Hosea.
[930.54 → 935.06] He lived in a dark time when Israel was being oppressed by foreign empires.
[935.06 → 941.18] And he chose hope when he said God could turn this valley of trouble into a door of hope.
[941.18 → 944.10] Like the day when Israel came up from the land of Egypt.
[944.46 → 950.18] God had surprised his people with redemption back in the days of the Exodus, and he could do so again.
[950.18 → 954.10] So it's God's past faithfulness that motivates hope for the future.
[954.26 → 958.74] You look forward by looking backward, trusting in nothing other than God's character.
[959.02 → 961.10] It's like the poet of Psalm 39 who says,
[961.30 → 963.60] And now, O Lord, what else can I naval for?
[963.92 → 965.18] You are my racial.
[965.40 → 969.98] In the New Testament, the earliest followers of Jesus cultivated this similar habit of hope.
[969.98 → 976.82] They believed that Jesus' life, death, and resurrection was God's surprising response to our slavery to evil and death.
[976.82 → 979.94] The empty tomb opened up a new door of hope.
[980.26 → 983.14] And they used the Greek word Ellis to describe this anticipation.
[983.66 → 987.60] The apostle Peter said that Jesus' resurrection opened up a living hope.
[987.86 → 989.08] That people can be reborn.
[989.52 → 991.36] To become new and different kinds of humans.
[992.16 → 993.98] More than once, the apostle Paul says,
[994.18 → 997.64] The good news about Jesus announces the Ellis of glory.
[997.64 → 1003.76] In both cases, this Ellis is based on a person, the risen Jesus, who has overcome death.
[1004.16 → 1005.78] And this hope wasn't just for humans.
[1006.14 → 1012.26] The apostles believed that what happened to Jesus in the resurrection was a foretaste of what God had planned for the whole universe.
[1012.60 → 1013.36] In Paul's words,
[1013.56 → 1021.10] It's a hope that creation itself will be liberated from slavery to corruption into freedom when God's children are glorified.
[1021.62 → 1023.48] So Christian hope is bold,
[1023.48 → 1028.16] waiting for humanity and the whole universe to be rescued from evil and death.
[1028.36 → 1029.90] And some would say it's crazy.
[1030.22 → 1031.06] And maybe it is.
[1031.18 → 1034.24] But biblical hope isn't optimism based on the odds.
[1034.38 → 1040.96] It's a choice to wait for God to bring about a future that's as surprising as a crucified man rising from the dead.
[1041.26 → 1045.76] Christian hope looks back to the risen Jesus in order to look forward.
[1045.76 → 1047.58] And so we wait.
[1047.96 → 1050.76] That's what the biblical words for hope are all about.
[1061.28 → 1062.48] Good morning.
[1064.00 → 1073.64] Welcome into worship on this second Sunday of Advent where we are exploring the theme and idea of hope.
[1073.64 → 1077.26] If you're a guest with us this morning, we are glad that you are here.
[1077.38 → 1078.08] My name is Chris.
[1078.26 → 1080.10] I'm one of the pastors here.
[1080.26 → 1084.46] And it's my privilege with a couple others to lead you in our worship together.
[1085.00 → 1087.06] Our worship today will come to the table.
[1087.36 → 1091.46] And so if you are here, you can already begin preparing your hearts for that.
[1091.54 → 1095.68] If you're online, you can participate with us when we come there as well.
[1096.32 → 1100.12] Just two really quick announcements before the greeting.
[1100.12 → 1109.56] In your mailboxes, if you have one of those here or on the Connect table at the back, you will have received an invitation.
[1110.48 → 1117.50] This invitation is to an event called Oh Holy Night that we are doing next weekend at 4 p.m.
[1117.96 → 1118.82] And so hear that.
[1119.00 → 1122.02] Next weekend at 4 p.m., we're going to come together.
[1122.14 → 1124.28] We're going to sing carols and other Christmas songs.
[1124.28 → 1127.88] And we're going to have a little children's worship time program and hear stories.
[1128.04 → 1129.32] And it's going to be a great evening.
[1130.04 → 1135.48] Following that, there will be a hot chocolate bar and a gingerbread cookie decorating station.
[1135.48 → 1144.80] And so what we hope is that you will receive this invitation and then pass it forward to a neighbour or a co-worker or a friend or someone,
[1144.96 → 1151.18] inviting them to join us on December 17 at 4 p.m. for Oh Holy Night.
[1151.34 → 1155.46] So we can sing into this Christmas season together.
[1156.10 → 1158.22] As well, the second announcement just beginning.
[1158.22 → 1166.20] On Christmas Day, December 25th, which is a Monday this year, we will be gathering for worship at 10 a.m.
[1166.20 → 1168.24] like we have traditionally in the past.
[1168.36 → 1172.46] But we wanted to remind you that we are doing that again this year.
[1172.64 → 1174.94] So Christmas Day at 10 a.m. here.
[1175.98 → 1184.02] I'm going to invite you to stand as we are welcomed into God's presence by receiving His greeting and by His calling us to worship Him.
[1184.50 → 1186.20] Receive the greeting of God.
[1186.20 → 1190.06] Grace, mercy, and peace to you.
[1190.28 → 1196.76] From God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, His Son, and our Saviour, through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[1197.76 → 1198.16] Amen.
[1216.20 → 1239.04] Today we light the second candle of Advent, the candle of hope.
[1239.04 → 1247.06] N.T. Wright describes the Christmas season in his intro to his book, For All God's Worth.
[1248.06 → 1255.68] Christmas is God lighting a candle, and you don't light a candle in a room that's already full of sunlight.
[1256.48 → 1264.18] You light a candle in a room so murky that the candle, when lit, reveals just how bad things really are.
[1264.18 → 1272.24] The light shines in the darkness, says St. John, and the darkness has not overcome it.
[1272.86 → 1273.66] And there it is.
[1274.62 → 1283.92] Our hope in the person of Jesus, even in this dark and murky world, the darkness has not overcome Him.
[1283.92 → 1285.92] Jesus has overcome.
[1285.92 → 1286.50] Jesus has overcome.
[1287.22 → 1289.40] He is our lighthouse in the storm.
[1290.76 → 1293.62] Our only true hope.
[1294.38 → 1295.84] Let's join our voices in worship.
[1295.84 → 1319.48] O come, O come, Emmanuel,
[1319.48 → 1326.36] Some captive Israel
[1326.36 → 1334.12] That mourns in lowly exile near
[1334.12 → 1341.04] Until the Son of God appears
[1341.04 → 1348.84] Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
[1348.84 → 1354.60] Shall come to thee, O Israel
[1354.60 → 1364.08] O come, O wisdom, from on high
[1364.08 → 1369.60] Through order and all things vitally
[1369.60 → 1376.90] To us the path of knowledge shown
[1376.90 → 1382.66] And teach us in its ways to go
[1382.66 → 1391.54] Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
[1391.54 → 1396.66] Shall come to thee, O Israel
[1396.66 → 1402.42] O come, thou branch of Jesse
[1402.42 → 1408.18] O come, thou branch of Jesse
[1408.18 → 1413.94] And rescue them
[1413.94 → 1419.94] From depths of hell your people save
[1419.94 → 1425.94] And give them victory o'er the grave
[1425.94 → 1431.70] Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
[1431.70 → 1437.46] O come, thou Christ, O Israel
[1437.46 → 1446.46] O come, thou bright and morning star
[1446.46 → 1453.46] And bring us comfort from afar
[1453.46 → 1459.22] Disperse the gloomy cloud of night
[1459.22 → 1467.22] And death's of shadow's moon to fly
[1467.22 → 1475.22] Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
[1475.22 → 1480.98] Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel
[1480.98 → 1482.74] O Israel
[1482.74 → 1486.74] O Israel
[1486.74 → 1496.34] O Israel
[1496.34 → 1506.38] O Israel
[1506.38 → 1510.50] Jesus, hope of the nations
[1510.50 → 1516.50] Jesus, comfort for all who mourn.
[1516.50 → 1523.50] You are the source of heaven's hope on earth.
[1523.50 → 1527.50] Jesus, light in the darkness.
[1527.50 → 1532.50] Jesus, truth in each circumstance.
[1532.50 → 1538.50] You are the source of heaven's light on earth.
[1538.50 → 1543.50] In history you lived and died.
[1543.50 → 1548.50] You broke the chains you rose to life.
[1548.50 → 1552.50] You are the hope living in us.
[1552.50 → 1556.50] You are the rock in whom we trust.
[1556.50 → 1564.50] You are the light shining for all the world to see.
[1564.50 → 1569.50] You rose from the dead, thunder in fear.
[1569.50 → 1573.50] Our Prince of Peace drawing us here.
[1573.50 → 1580.50] Jesus our home living for all who will receive.
[1580.50 → 1582.50] Lord, we believe.
[1590.50 → 1594.50] Jesus, hope of the nations.
[1594.50 → 1599.50] Jesus, comfort for all who mourn.
[1599.50 → 1606.50] You are the source of heaven's hope on earth.
[1606.50 → 1610.50] Jesus, light in the darkness.
[1610.50 → 1615.50] Jesus, truth in each circumstance.
[1615.50 → 1616.50] Jesus, truth in the darkness.
[1616.50 → 1621.50] You are the source of heaven's hope on earth.
[1621.50 → 1625.50] In history you lived and died.
[1625.50 → 1630.50] You broke the chains you rose to life.
[1630.50 → 1631.50] You are the light on earth.
[1631.50 → 1645.50] You are the light shining for all the world to see.
[1645.50 → 1650.50] You rose from the dead, conquering fear.
[1650.50 → 1654.50] Our Prince of Peace drawing us near.
[1654.50 → 1660.50] Jesus our home living for all who will receive.
[1660.50 → 1664.70] Lord, we believe
[1664.70 → 1668.78] Lord, we believe
[1668.78 → 1672.82] Lord, we believe
[1672.82 → 1682.32] Father, the world is so dark and murky
[1682.32 → 1684.36] we sometimes lose sight of your light.
[1685.36 → 1687.78] We give darkness more credit and power than we should,
[1687.92 → 1690.04] forgetting in whom our hope is found.
[1691.02 → 1694.52] Forgive us for not trusting in the power and the beauty of your light,
[1695.34 → 1698.06] for not seeing the beauty of your love.
[1699.84 → 1702.28] How we longed to see your light
[1702.28 → 1705.62] shining in this dark world. Holy Spirit,
[1706.44 → 1710.16] will you open up our eyes to the hope we have in Jesus
[1710.16 → 1714.56] and the power that is in his name. Jesus, the darkness
[1714.56 → 1718.46] has not and will not overcome you. Help us
[1718.46 → 1724.10] to walk boldly, knowing it is in you alone that our hope is found. Amen.
[1724.10 → 1737.72] In Christ alone
[1737.72 → 1750.34] My hope is found. He is my life, my strength, my soul. This cornerstone, this solid ground,
[1750.34 → 1759.76] firm through the fiercest drought and storm. What highs of love, what depths of peace,
[1759.76 → 1769.70] when fears are still and strivings cease. My comforter, my all in all,
[1769.70 → 1775.04] here in the love of Christ I stand.
[1775.04 → 1793.28] In Christ alone, who took on flesh, fullness of love and helpless faith,
[1793.28 → 1805.56] this gift of love and righteousness, scorned by the ones he came to save. Till on the cross
[1805.56 → 1822.38] that Jesus died, the wrath of God was satisfied. For every sin on him was laid, here in the death of Christ I live.
[1822.38 → 1829.38] in Christ alone, who took on flesh, the wrath of God was satisfied.
[1829.38 → 1844.38] There in the ground his body lay, Light of the world by darkness slain. Then bursting forth in glorious day,
[1844.38 → 1853.38] up from the grave he rose again. And as he stands in victory,
[1853.38 → 1862.38] since curse has lost its grip on me. For I am his, and he is mine,
[1862.38 → 1869.38] bought with the precious blood of Christ.
[1869.38 → 1885.38] No guilt in life, no fear in death, This is the power of Christ in me.
[1885.38 → 1894.38] From life's first cry to final breath, Jesus commends my destiny.
[1894.38 → 1903.38] No power of hell, no scheme of man, Can ever pluck me from his hand.
[1903.38 → 1912.38] Till he returns, or calls me home, Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.
[1912.38 → 1921.38] No power of hell, no scheme of man, Can ever pluck me from his hand.
[1921.38 → 1932.38] Till he returns, or calls me home, Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.
[1932.38 → 1937.38] Till he returns, or calls me home, Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.
[1937.38 → 1942.38] Till he returns, or calls me home, Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.
[1942.38 → 1959.38] Till he returns, or calls me home, Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.
[1959.38 → 1970.38] All have declared the glory of the risen Lord,
[1970.38 → 1982.38] Who can compare, With the beauty of the Lord.
[1982.38 → 1993.38] Forever he will be, Forever he will be, The Lamb upon the throne,
[1993.38 → 2005.38] I gladly bow my knee, I gladly bow my knee, And worship him alone.
[2005.38 → 2021.38] I will proclaim, The glory of the risen Lord, Who once was slain,
[2021.38 → 2026.38] To reconcile, O man, To come.
[2026.38 → 2036.38] Forever he will be, Forever he will be, The Lamb upon the throne,
[2036.38 → 2044.38] The Lamb upon the throne, I gladly bow my knee, I gladly bow my knee,
[2044.38 → 2046.38] And worship him alone.
[2046.38 → 2049.38] And worship him alone.
[2049.38 → 2057.38] Forever he will be, Forever he will be, The Lamb upon the throne,
[2057.38 → 2063.38] The Lamb upon the throne, The Lamb upon the throne, I gladly bow my knee,
[2063.38 → 2073.38] I gladly bow my knee, I gladly bow my knee, And worship him alone.
[2073.38 → 2078.38] I gladly bow my knee, I gladly bow my knee, And worship him alone.
[2078.38 → 2079.38] And worship him alone.
[2079.38 → 2080.38] And worship him alone.
[2080.38 → 2081.38] Yes.
[2081.38 → 2083.38] Let's take them to church.
[2083.38 → 2084.38] Okay.
[2084.38 → 2086.38] Good morning.
[2086.38 → 2087.38] My name is Claim.
[2087.38 → 2108.36] I also have done this in the Attire, and I thank you for fulfilling the
[2108.36 → 2109.80] I'm one of the deacons here at Emanuel.
[2110.22 → 2113.90] The first offering is for the ministry and missions of our church.
[2114.80 → 2117.52] The special offering today is a reverse offering.
[2118.38 → 2123.40] We have been blessed as a church and are called to pass that blessing on to others.
[2124.08 → 2130.94] So if you know someone who is struggling, you can give them a small gift by way of a gift card.
[2130.94 → 2143.96] If we do run out of gift cards, or you know someone who needs more than $25, talk to myself or one of the other deacons after the service, and we are happy to help.
[2146.92 → 2149.96] Matthew chapter 6 verse 1 to 4.
[2149.96 → 2154.66] Truly I tell you, they have not received their reward in full.
[2155.44 → 2164.60] But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing so that your giving may be in secret.
[2165.64 → 2170.92] Then your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you.
[2170.92 → 2180.98] There are the bags are for the budget and then there are baskets going around with the gift cards in it.
[2181.28 → 2181.70] Thank you.
[2181.70 → 2182.70] Thank you.
[2200.92 → 2230.90] Thank you.
[2230.92 → 2247.42] Thank you.
[2247.42 → 2255.68] Thank you.
[2255.68 → 2257.36] Thank you.
[2257.36 → 2260.48] since day
[2260.48 → 2262.16] oh
[2262.16 → 2266.14] shepherds
[2266.14 → 2268.72] why this jubilee
[2268.72 → 2271.56] why your joyous
[2271.56 → 2272.96] strains prolong
[2272.96 → 2274.92] what glad
[2274.92 → 2277.16] joys and tidings
[2277.16 → 2278.86] be which
[2278.86 → 2280.52] inspire your
[2280.52 → 2282.28] heavenly song
[2282.28 → 2290.68] Gloria
[2290.68 → 2295.62] in excels is Do
[2295.62 → 2301.68] Gloria
[2301.68 → 2309.68] in excels is Do
[2309.68 → 2315.68] come to Bethlehem
[2315.68 → 2317.40] and sing
[2317.40 → 2319.58] him whose birth
[2319.58 → 2321.82] the angels sing
[2321.82 → 2323.96] come adore
[2323.96 → 2325.70] on bed and
[2325.70 → 2327.94] knee Christ the
[2327.94 → 2329.86] Lord the new
[2329.86 → 2330.80] Lord King
[2330.80 → 2333.50] Gloria
[2333.50 → 2335.50] Gloria
[2335.50 → 2343.50] in excels is Do
[2344.06 → 2347.42] Gloria
[2347.42 → 2349.50] in excels is Do
[2349.50 → 2351.48] Gloria
[2351.48 → 2355.84] in excels is Do
[2355.84 → 2356.84] Amen.
[2385.84 → 2392.84] Good morning, everybody.
[2392.84 → 2398.84] Can I have the preschoolers all the way up to grade four come up to the front today?
[2398.84 → 2416.84] I have a question for you.
[2416.84 → 2426.84] Have you guys ever waited for something that was going to take forever to get here?
[2426.84 → 2428.84] Christmas?
[2428.84 → 2429.84] Your birthday?
[2429.84 → 2431.84] Is anybody else?
[2431.84 → 2432.84] Ruby?
[2432.84 → 2433.84] Christmas?
[2433.84 → 2434.84] Yeah?
[2434.84 → 2436.84] Anybody else?
[2436.84 → 2441.84] And how did you guys feel when you had to wait and wait and wait?
[2441.84 → 2445.84] Halloween?
[2445.84 → 2448.84] How did you feel?
[2448.84 → 2451.84] Were you excited?
[2451.84 → 2455.84] Were you anxious?
[2455.84 → 2457.84] How did you guys feel?
[2457.84 → 2460.84] Ruby, how did you feel when you have to wait for Christmas?
[2460.84 → 2461.84] Excited?
[2461.84 → 2463.84] Because we have lots of things going on.
[2463.84 → 2474.84] Today in children's worship time, Joseph is going to get a message from an angel of a surprise.
[2474.84 → 2477.84] And then they have to wait for the surprise to come.
[2477.84 → 2483.84] And we are going to learn from Joseph's point of view today in the birth of the story.
[2483.84 → 2485.84] So can everybody stand up?
[2485.84 → 2487.84] I'm going to look at the parents.
[2487.84 → 2491.84] And here we go.
[2491.84 → 2492.84] The Lord be with you.
[2492.84 → 2493.84] And also with you.
[2493.84 → 2494.84] And also with you.
[2494.84 → 2495.84] And we are going to ask you.
[2495.84 → 2496.84] And also with you.
[2496.84 → 2497.84] And also with you.
[2497.84 → 2499.84] And also with you.
[2499.84 → 2526.52] Good morning.
[2526.52 → 2556.50] Thank you.
[2556.52 → 2563.34] We are grateful for everyone's generosity and gifts and using their resources to serve
[2563.34 → 2564.46] the Lord through this church.
[2564.88 → 2569.08] We encourage everyone to think of how you can continue to do that.
[2569.56 → 2574.28] And then one final push, if we can get to the point where we meet our budget for the
[2574.28 → 2577.40] year as we have in past years, that would be a wonderful blessing.
[2577.40 → 2583.28] If you have any questions about how to give, there are numerous ways to talk to myself, any
[2583.28 → 2586.34] of the other council members, elders, pastors, staff.
[2586.92 → 2589.48] There's also information in our e-bulletins.
[2589.48 → 2596.20] Also, a couple other announcements on the youth side, or actually one of them is for church
[2596.20 → 2596.50] wide.
[2596.64 → 2598.04] It's for the Mexico mission trip.
[2598.96 → 2603.70] It's often a lot of youth that attend, and youth grade 10 and up are encouraged to attend,
[2604.12 → 2606.96] but everyone consider that this trip is open to anyone.
[2606.96 → 2613.28] So for details on signing up and on what to do for that, see Brandon sitting in the back
[2613.28 → 2613.74] corner here.
[2613.84 → 2615.70] He'll be at the Connect booth after church.
[2615.70 → 2623.00] Also, tonight for youth, the HCBC will be happening from 7 till 8 o'clock.
[2623.66 → 2628.42] And we just got some exciting news from the Skipper family that Dave and Sheila Skipper had
[2628.42 → 2630.38] a baby girl, Ava Rose.
[2631.40 → 2633.84] So we praise God for that.
[2636.14 → 2638.82] Okay, let's turn to our Lord in prayer.
[2638.82 → 2648.42] God of creation, Lord of all, our loving Father, we come to you this morning through
[2648.42 → 2651.70] Jesus, who is the way, the truth, and the life.
[2652.70 → 2656.62] As we just sang, all heaven declares the glory of the risen Lord.
[2657.18 → 2660.10] Who can compare with the beauty of the Lord?
[2661.42 → 2666.98] Lord, we know we do not need to be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer
[2666.98 → 2671.14] and petition, with thanksgiving, present our request to you, God.
[2671.94 → 2676.32] Lord, we praise you with thanksgiving for all the blessings you bestow on us.
[2677.00 → 2679.54] Every good and perfect gift comes from you, Lord.
[2680.74 → 2685.58] We thank you for the gift of children, and we pray your blessing on the families in our
[2685.58 → 2687.74] congregation who are expecting new little ones.
[2688.32 → 2692.96] We praise you for the exciting news with the Skippers of their new baby, Ava Rose.
[2692.96 → 2697.50] And Lord, we pray for those who long to have children and have not.
[2698.04 → 2701.88] Help us trust you to fulfill your will for our lives.
[2702.98 → 2704.66] Lord, we praise you for our health.
[2705.24 → 2710.02] We rejoice with Jerry Jansen and her family, as Jerry's granddaughter, Christina, is feeling
[2710.02 → 2713.74] positive effects from the medication she's taking in her lupus treatment.
[2713.74 → 2719.36] And we thank you also, Lord, for your hand at work in Jerry's daughter, Honda, as her heart
[2719.36 → 2721.92] valve surgery was successful, and she's back home now.
[2723.02 → 2729.42] Lord, we lift Dennis Coleman as he adapts to living with his diabetes diagnosis and adjusts
[2729.42 → 2730.34] to his new home.
[2731.04 → 2736.24] In the midst of change, Lord, bless us with the peace of your constant, unchanging love.
[2737.78 → 2742.02] Lord, we pray for SAI and Greta as SAI is going through tests and treatment.
[2742.02 → 2745.64] Lord, bring them your peace in this time of uncertainty.
[2746.64 → 2750.28] We also lift John Grass as he undergoes medical tests.
[2750.88 → 2755.82] We ask that you bring John healing and comfort, and we pray for good results for the tests.
[2757.34 → 2760.64] Lord, at times our lives are so full of uncertainty.
[2761.60 → 2767.14] Help us hold fast to the certainty of hope and a future that we may have in you, Lord.
[2767.14 → 2773.78] We also pray for Emmanuel Church and the ministries you have led us to participate in.
[2774.42 → 2780.30] Lord, make us a beacon of your hope and a love and love to a broken and hurting world.
[2781.40 → 2785.76] We pray, Lord, that you provide this world with a peace that is only found in you.
[2786.44 → 2791.50] For those who are suffering from the results of war and violence happening in various places,
[2791.50 → 2797.28] we pray that you provide them with both physical and mental healing and an end to these wars.
[2798.84 → 2801.78] Lord, we pray for families, families that are suffering.
[2802.48 → 2808.28] There's brokenness, loss, loneliness, and grief touching many of us in numerous ways.
[2809.28 → 2813.74] Some of us are experiencing burdensome times of hardships and underemployment.
[2814.50 → 2819.02] Lord, help us cast all our burdens on you and know that you will sustain us.
[2819.02 → 2821.52] You will never let the righteous be shaken.
[2822.90 → 2825.68] Heal our families and heal our hearts, Lord.
[2826.14 → 2828.26] Come, O come, Emmanuel, we pray.
[2829.28 → 2833.12] Lord, as we gather around the table as a body of believers,
[2833.70 → 2838.22] Lord, we pray that we would be filled as we partake in communion.
[2839.58 → 2843.32] And as Pastor Chris now comes to bring us your word of Advent hope,
[2843.82 → 2846.78] we pray that your message through him will resonate in our hearts.
[2846.78 → 2847.10] Let us pray that you will pray that you will be filled as we pray.
[2847.10 → 2847.78] Let us pray that you will be filled as we pray.
[2847.78 → 2850.14] Let us pray that you will be the gospel in the weeks ahead.
[2851.08 → 2853.76] Let us hold true to the song we just sang.
[2854.38 → 2857.34] We will proclaim the glory of the risen Lord,
[2857.82 → 2861.82] who once was slain to reconcile man to God.
[2862.58 → 2865.68] Forever you will be the Lamb upon the throne,
[2866.08 → 2869.54] and we gladly bow our knee and worship you alone.
[2869.96 → 2871.12] In Jesus' name we pray.
[2871.58 → 2871.86] Amen.
[2871.86 → 2871.94] Amen.
[2871.94 → 2872.00] Amen.
[2876.78 → 2897.96] If you have a Bible, I'm going to invite you,
[2899.40 → 2902.34] excuse me, to turn that to Isaiah 8.
[2902.34 → 2907.28] Isaiah 8, we're going to read verse 11 through 17.
[2908.90 → 2912.66] As we go through, and before we do, just a note,
[2912.76 → 2916.40] we're going to really focus on verse 17 of this text,
[2916.54 → 2919.86] and so keep that in mind as we read together.
[2928.86 → 2930.26] Isaiah 8.
[2932.34 → 2936.64] Starting at verse 11.
[2936.68 → 2942.02] This is what the Lord says to me with his strong hand upon me,
[2942.28 → 2945.12] warning me not to follow the way of his people.
[2946.12 → 2949.92] Do not call conspiracy everything this people call conspiracy.
[2950.32 → 2953.60] Do not fear what they fear, and do not dread it.
[2954.26 → 2958.22] The Lord Almighty is the one you are to regard as holy.
[2958.22 → 2960.30] He is the one you are to fear.
[2960.60 → 2962.52] He is the one you are to dread.
[2962.86 → 2966.66] He will be a holy place for both Israel and Judah.
[2967.08 → 2969.78] He will be a stone that causes people to stumble,
[2969.96 → 2971.40] a rock that makes them fall.
[2971.98 → 2973.68] And for the people of Jerusalem,
[2973.90 → 2975.66] he will be a trap and a snare.
[2976.12 → 2977.34] Many of them will stumble.
[2977.48 → 2978.72] They will fall and be broken.
[2978.88 → 2980.40] They will be snared and captured.
[2981.50 → 2983.64] Bind up this testimony of warning,
[2983.64 → 2986.98] and seal up God's instruction among my disciples.
[2987.86 → 2989.72] I will wait for the Lord,
[2990.08 → 2992.86] who is hiding his face from the descendants of Jacob.
[2993.30 → 2996.44] I will put my trust in him.
[2996.98 → 2998.24] This is the word of the Lord.
[2998.24 → 3006.76] So, for about five hours this week,
[3007.16 → 3016.16] an entire nation had their hopes wrapped up in one unsure thing.
[3017.52 → 3019.20] Rob knows what I'm talking about.
[3019.88 → 3020.98] He might be the only one.
[3021.98 → 3023.94] For about five hours this week,
[3023.94 → 3028.20] the Toronto Blue Jays were surely signing Showed OTAN.
[3029.22 → 3031.62] He was on a plane and had come to Toronto.
[3032.78 → 3034.22] Kabuki, another Blue Jay,
[3034.32 → 3036.56] had rented out a Japanese restaurant.
[3036.90 → 3039.92] December 8th is important in Japanese culture.
[3040.94 → 3044.40] The Twitter verse, Verse, whatever that's called now,
[3044.46 → 3045.30] was a buzz,
[3045.44 → 3049.02] and everyone was super excited and super hopeful
[3049.02 → 3054.32] until word came that,
[3054.44 → 3058.06] no, he was still at his home in Los Angeles,
[3058.46 → 3060.40] and he wasn't, in fact, in Toronto.
[3060.82 → 3061.98] And then a couple of hours later,
[3062.08 → 3063.48] Hope was dashed even further
[3063.48 → 3066.46] when we found out that he'd signed with the Dodgers.
[3068.04 → 3070.74] Now, for those of you who that means absolutely nothing,
[3072.04 → 3074.58] Showed OTAN is a two-way baseball player.
[3074.58 → 3078.84] He is a once-in-a-century phenomenon as an ace pitcher
[3078.84 → 3082.64] and a home-run smashing derby winner.
[3083.18 → 3085.06] He is a phenomenal player
[3085.06 → 3088.24] around which the Blue Jays could have easily built a World Series team.
[3089.36 → 3092.02] I'm old enough to remember the last time the Blue Jays won.
[3093.24 → 3096.32] I hope that my kids will also have that experience.
[3098.16 → 3100.28] And it could have happened next season.
[3101.00 → 3103.60] But alas, probably the Dodgers.
[3103.60 → 3108.36] Hope in the world can be like that.
[3108.72 → 3111.26] And it can sometimes feel a fickle thing,
[3111.96 → 3114.44] at least for Toronto sports fans.
[3117.10 → 3118.20] Yeah, there it is.
[3118.26 → 3118.64] Thank you.
[3122.06 → 3127.56] This morning, as we explore this idea of hope,
[3127.56 → 3133.32] my desire is that we will see,
[3133.80 → 3139.98] in contrast to how we often talk about hope culturally
[3139.98 → 3141.34] and in the world today,
[3141.68 → 3147.02] and what the Bible can offer us in its place.
[3147.94 → 3149.42] Now, our focus, like I said,
[3149.50 → 3152.56] comes from verse 17 of the text.
[3152.56 → 3154.26] And as you read,
[3154.50 → 3156.64] please get the sense of the text,
[3156.76 → 3160.80] where the people are standing in this place of uncertainty.
[3161.72 → 3163.94] They're standing in this place of fear
[3163.94 → 3165.88] and an unknown future,
[3166.38 → 3169.66] where things feel like a trap,
[3169.80 → 3173.14] and where people will be stumbling around in darkness,
[3173.32 → 3175.30] not sure what is going on.
[3175.30 → 3176.96] And then Isaiah says,
[3177.34 → 3179.34] I will wait for the Lord,
[3179.34 → 3182.38] who is hiding his face from the descendants of Jacob.
[3182.74 → 3186.68] I will put my trust in him.
[3188.00 → 3190.56] That word, translated trust,
[3190.90 → 3192.78] in Isaiah 8 verse 17,
[3193.06 → 3196.56] is one of the Hebrew words for hope.
[3198.04 → 3199.84] If you read the ESV,
[3200.00 → 3202.54] which is another really excellent translation of the Bible,
[3202.54 → 3204.70] it says hope there.
[3205.74 → 3208.70] If you read the New English translation of the Bible,
[3208.80 → 3210.10] which again is another perfect one,
[3210.34 → 3212.12] it says wait there.
[3214.26 → 3216.30] Trust and wait.
[3217.62 → 3218.10] Hope.
[3218.98 → 3221.26] Put my hope in him, says Isaiah.
[3221.40 → 3223.74] I will wait for him.
[3225.04 → 3229.22] This Advent, as we look at these words of Advent,
[3229.40 → 3231.46] peace, hope, joy, and love,
[3231.46 → 3233.84] we started last week with peace,
[3234.00 → 3234.94] this week hope,
[3235.10 → 3237.64] next week Josh is going to help us explore joy.
[3238.34 → 3239.64] As we look this week,
[3240.16 → 3241.96] biblical hope is different
[3241.96 → 3244.96] than the kinds or ideas of hope
[3244.96 → 3248.58] that are talked about in culture and in the world.
[3250.26 → 3253.26] This morning is not only for us
[3253.26 → 3255.88] a biblical theology of hope,
[3255.94 → 3257.34] but a bit of a contrast
[3257.34 → 3259.52] to this cultural idea of hope.
[3259.52 → 3263.10] And what I hope you will see is,
[3263.16 → 3264.88] and here's our big idea for the morning,
[3266.06 → 3269.90] biblical hope is not based on circumstances,
[3270.48 → 3272.64] but on the person of God
[3272.64 → 3275.64] who has promised a certain future.
[3277.10 → 3279.26] Biblical hope is not based on circumstances,
[3279.48 → 3280.64] whatever they may be,
[3280.90 → 3282.60] but on the person of God
[3282.60 → 3285.82] who has promised a certain future.
[3285.82 → 3291.00] Now, just like the translation of the Hebrew word,
[3291.38 → 3293.64] naval, into English,
[3294.38 → 3296.74] the concept of biblical hope
[3296.74 → 3301.86] includes those two aspects of trust and waiting.
[3303.14 → 3303.72] Right?
[3303.78 → 3306.60] You can trust in the midst of a need for hope
[3306.60 → 3309.60] because you can know that God has promised
[3309.60 → 3311.66] a particular future.
[3311.66 → 3314.58] And because we trust with hope,
[3314.72 → 3317.78] we wait for a certain future to come about
[3317.78 → 3319.78] knowing that it is fixed.
[3321.30 → 3322.16] And so already,
[3322.44 → 3324.42] as we begin just digging here,
[3325.32 → 3327.60] right, when I say that biblical hope
[3327.60 → 3329.44] is not based on circumstances,
[3329.70 → 3331.04] but on the person of God
[3331.04 → 3333.68] who has promised a certain future,
[3334.34 → 3337.38] that word certain, right,
[3337.38 → 3339.20] that word in certain future
[3339.20 → 3343.28] means particular and fixed.
[3345.00 → 3346.92] The future that God promises
[3346.92 → 3348.48] is particular
[3348.48 → 3351.54] because it looks a particular way.
[3351.68 → 3353.32] It looks a certain way
[3353.32 → 3356.24] and He knows exactly how it looks
[3356.24 → 3358.66] and He knows exactly how to get us there.
[3359.52 → 3359.64] Right?
[3359.68 → 3361.32] God has promised a future
[3361.32 → 3363.88] that can be told about
[3363.88 → 3366.12] and anticipated already
[3366.12 → 3368.70] because He has revealed it to us
[3368.70 → 3369.66] in His Word.
[3371.24 → 3371.42] Right?
[3371.46 → 3372.34] It is a future
[3372.34 → 3375.18] when all things are made new.
[3376.02 → 3376.94] It is a future
[3376.94 → 3378.28] when there's no more crying
[3378.28 → 3380.56] or dying or pain
[3380.56 → 3382.40] for the old order has been washed away.
[3382.62 → 3383.40] It is a future
[3383.40 → 3385.64] where everything is made right,
[3385.88 → 3387.96] where there's no more injustice,
[3387.96 → 3390.34] where there's perfect shalom,
[3390.74 → 3391.92] peace with God.
[3391.92 → 3392.90] It is a future
[3392.90 → 3394.88] where the dwelling place of God
[3394.88 → 3397.00] is now with humanity.
[3397.98 → 3398.08] Right?
[3398.10 → 3399.60] That's part of our hope
[3399.60 → 3403.74] and it is a particularly well-defined view
[3403.74 → 3405.34] of human history
[3405.34 → 3407.16] and where we're going.
[3408.52 → 3411.36] And that hope is particular
[3411.36 → 3412.44] or it is certain
[3412.44 → 3415.02] and it is fixed.
[3415.68 → 3415.84] Right?
[3415.86 → 3417.28] That's the other aspect of this.
[3417.40 → 3419.66] The hope that God has promised
[3419.66 → 3421.50] for a certain future
[3421.50 → 3422.84] is both particular
[3422.84 → 3424.38] and fixed.
[3424.60 → 3425.70] And what that means is
[3425.70 → 3427.22] it can't be changed.
[3428.10 → 3428.22] Right?
[3428.26 → 3429.76] That God will accomplish
[3429.76 → 3430.60] the purpose
[3430.60 → 3432.64] for which He has set out
[3432.64 → 3433.70] both in creation
[3433.70 → 3434.78] and in redemption.
[3435.22 → 3435.42] Right?
[3435.46 → 3436.70] In revealing His Word
[3436.70 → 3437.42] to the world
[3437.42 → 3438.86] and His coming down
[3438.86 → 3440.14] as the Word made flesh
[3440.14 → 3441.60] in the person of Jesus Christ.
[3441.88 → 3442.38] In fact,
[3442.94 → 3444.08] Christmas itself
[3444.08 → 3445.74] is an example
[3445.74 → 3447.64] of how this truth,
[3447.90 → 3450.32] this fixed future truth
[3450.32 → 3452.88] is realized among us.
[3453.84 → 3454.24] Right?
[3454.24 → 3454.88] Because Christmas
[3454.88 → 3456.38] leads to the life
[3456.38 → 3457.44] and the death
[3457.44 → 3458.24] and the resurrection
[3458.24 → 3459.56] of Jesus Christ.
[3460.28 → 3462.02] In Romans 5 verse 6 says,
[3462.02 → 3463.06] You see,
[3463.94 → 3465.54] at just the right time,
[3466.02 → 3467.84] when we were still powerless,
[3468.46 → 3470.88] Christ died for the ungodly.
[3471.42 → 3472.34] And that phrase,
[3472.44 → 3474.82] at just the right time,
[3475.38 → 3477.34] means everything here.
[3478.46 → 3478.70] Right?
[3478.82 → 3480.28] Everything God does
[3480.28 → 3482.82] is at just the right time.
[3484.40 → 3486.76] His future and His plans
[3486.76 → 3487.80] are fixed
[3487.80 → 3490.92] because God is the Lord of time,
[3490.92 → 3491.96] not bound by it,
[3492.00 → 3493.16] but ruling over it.
[3494.20 → 3494.32] Right?
[3494.38 → 3495.56] Before the foundation
[3495.56 → 3496.62] of the world,
[3496.74 → 3498.62] before God even began
[3498.62 → 3499.46] to create,
[3499.66 → 3500.84] He knew exactly
[3500.84 → 3502.08] what would happen
[3502.08 → 3503.34] and how He would
[3503.34 → 3504.30] redeem the world
[3504.30 → 3504.96] in response,
[3505.06 → 3505.84] how He would bring it
[3505.84 → 3506.72] back to Himself
[3506.72 → 3508.72] at just the right time.
[3511.44 → 3513.50] And God's promise
[3513.50 → 3515.98] isn't like when you
[3515.98 → 3518.00] or I say a promise,
[3518.12 → 3518.60] when we say,
[3518.74 → 3519.56] I promise, right?
[3519.70 → 3520.36] There's always
[3520.36 → 3521.26] the possibility
[3521.26 → 3523.00] of falling short.
[3523.90 → 3524.50] There's always
[3524.50 → 3525.24] the possibility
[3525.24 → 3526.42] of not following through.
[3527.04 → 3527.94] With God,
[3528.06 → 3529.24] there is no possibility
[3529.24 → 3530.34] of falling short
[3530.34 → 3531.02] of His promise.
[3531.14 → 3532.22] There is no possibility
[3532.22 → 3534.20] of Him falling short.
[3534.30 → 3535.24] There is no possibility
[3535.24 → 3537.14] of God being made a liar.
[3537.60 → 3537.88] In fact,
[3538.06 → 3538.90] Numbers 23
[3538.90 → 3540.30] addresses this exactly,
[3540.82 → 3541.02] saying,
[3541.14 → 3542.44] God is not human
[3542.44 → 3543.54] that He should lie,
[3543.68 → 3544.62] not a human being
[3544.62 → 3545.54] that He should change
[3545.54 → 3546.50] His mind.
[3546.82 → 3547.64] Does He speak
[3547.64 → 3548.60] and then not act?
[3548.96 → 3549.86] Does He promise
[3549.86 → 3550.70] and not fulfill?
[3552.54 → 3553.60] Of course He does.
[3553.70 → 3554.34] He promises
[3554.34 → 3555.74] and fulfills.
[3555.88 → 3556.80] That's who God is.
[3556.88 → 3558.14] He can't lie.
[3558.42 → 3559.28] He doesn't promise
[3559.28 → 3560.32] and leave that promise
[3560.32 → 3560.88] unfulfilled
[3560.88 → 3561.86] because that would be
[3561.86 → 3563.68] contrary to His nature,
[3564.24 → 3565.60] the very being of God.
[3567.52 → 3568.54] Biblical hope
[3568.54 → 3570.02] is trust
[3570.02 → 3571.50] and waiting,
[3571.50 → 3572.64] or it is trust
[3572.64 → 3573.98] in waiting
[3573.98 → 3576.48] for a fixed,
[3576.92 → 3578.02] particular,
[3578.82 → 3580.56] certain future.
[3583.20 → 3584.20] Now culturally,
[3584.56 → 3585.36] let's contrast,
[3585.52 → 3585.92] culturally,
[3586.28 → 3587.28] in the world today,
[3587.48 → 3588.84] hope is something
[3588.84 → 3590.52] a little different
[3590.52 → 3591.58] and what I hope
[3591.58 → 3592.68] we will begin to see,
[3592.82 → 3593.74] what I hope
[3593.74 → 3594.50] we will begin to see
[3594.50 → 3596.72] is that it is something
[3596.72 → 3598.58] a little bit less
[3598.58 → 3600.38] than what the Bible
[3600.38 → 3600.98] has to offer.
[3601.66 → 3602.86] Generally speaking,
[3603.06 → 3604.40] hope in our world
[3604.40 → 3606.50] is a sense of longing,
[3607.18 → 3607.42] right?
[3607.48 → 3608.54] And that sense of longing
[3608.54 → 3609.38] can be ambiguous
[3609.38 → 3610.56] or it can be unclear,
[3610.90 → 3612.18] but it's a desire
[3612.18 → 3613.12] for something else.
[3613.74 → 3614.30] Hope,
[3614.46 → 3615.58] for so many people,
[3616.06 → 3617.82] is defined
[3617.82 → 3619.26] as some sort of
[3619.26 → 3621.14] unsure optimism.
[3622.58 → 3622.82] Now,
[3623.28 → 3625.92] in its simplest form,
[3626.36 → 3626.52] right,
[3626.70 → 3628.12] optimism is about
[3628.12 → 3629.26] choosing to see
[3629.26 → 3630.24] how a situation
[3630.24 → 3631.86] could work out
[3631.86 → 3632.58] for the best.
[3633.72 → 3634.76] Not that it will,
[3635.50 → 3636.28] but that it could.
[3637.32 → 3637.54] Now,
[3637.88 → 3639.56] let's slow down
[3639.56 → 3639.94] a minute
[3639.94 → 3641.30] and be clear,
[3641.52 → 3641.72] right,
[3641.78 → 3643.04] because choosing
[3643.04 → 3643.96] to see
[3643.96 → 3645.04] how a situation
[3645.04 → 3646.20] could work out
[3646.20 → 3647.34] for the best
[3647.34 → 3649.04] is a really
[3649.04 → 3650.04] healthy practice.
[3652.04 → 3652.56] Right?
[3652.62 → 3653.46] In counselling,
[3653.98 → 3654.86] in therapy,
[3654.86 → 3655.88] if you've ever
[3655.88 → 3658.02] had the honour
[3658.02 → 3658.74] of doing that,
[3658.82 → 3659.60] you might talk
[3659.60 → 3661.64] about reframing
[3661.64 → 3662.60] your particular
[3662.60 → 3663.42] circumstances.
[3664.68 → 3664.88] Right?
[3664.88 → 3665.38] You might talk
[3665.38 → 3665.82] about how you
[3665.82 → 3666.68] choose to see
[3666.68 → 3667.54] things in a different
[3667.54 → 3667.96] light,
[3668.36 → 3669.28] in a way that
[3669.28 → 3670.06] doesn't reinforce
[3670.06 → 3671.22] negative ideas
[3671.22 → 3671.84] or reinforce
[3671.84 → 3673.50] words or things
[3673.50 → 3674.02] that are bouncing
[3674.02 → 3674.98] around in your head.
[3675.94 → 3676.76] And let me be,
[3676.88 → 3677.06] again,
[3677.18 → 3678.02] abundantly clear,
[3678.14 → 3678.24] like,
[3678.38 → 3679.32] doing that work
[3679.32 → 3680.38] is perfect.
[3681.08 → 3681.92] It's healthy,
[3682.40 → 3683.30] important work.
[3683.30 → 3684.38] And in my own
[3684.38 → 3684.88] counselling,
[3685.18 → 3685.60] people,
[3685.76 → 3686.58] and in receiving,
[3687.10 → 3687.26] right,
[3687.46 → 3689.84] we do this work
[3689.84 → 3690.72] together.
[3691.20 → 3692.86] And I use the language
[3692.86 → 3695.04] of making new meaning.
[3695.76 → 3695.98] Right?
[3696.02 → 3696.52] The idea
[3696.52 → 3697.92] being that
[3697.92 → 3699.14] after an experience
[3699.14 → 3700.02] or a situation,
[3700.02 → 3701.48] we make particular
[3701.48 → 3702.18] meanings
[3702.18 → 3703.88] of certain events
[3703.88 → 3705.78] because of things
[3705.78 → 3706.76] that were said to us
[3706.76 → 3707.60] or done to us
[3707.60 → 3708.84] or things that we did
[3708.84 → 3710.28] or things that we said.
[3710.98 → 3711.14] Right?
[3711.20 → 3711.48] And then,
[3711.74 → 3712.90] in our processing,
[3712.90 → 3714.06] the healthy,
[3714.74 → 3716.52] maybe even optimistic,
[3717.04 → 3717.82] reframing
[3717.82 → 3718.70] is to make
[3718.70 → 3719.90] a new meaning.
[3721.18 → 3721.38] Right?
[3721.40 → 3722.76] It's to redefine
[3722.76 → 3723.52] that event
[3723.52 → 3724.88] for us.
[3725.24 → 3725.38] Now,
[3725.42 → 3726.36] sometimes that requires
[3726.36 → 3727.26] talking to the people
[3727.26 → 3727.76] involved.
[3727.94 → 3729.22] Sometimes that requires
[3729.22 → 3730.32] forgiving other people.
[3730.48 → 3731.52] Sometimes that requires
[3731.52 → 3733.16] forgiving ourselves.
[3734.02 → 3735.18] And all of these things,
[3735.24 → 3735.42] again,
[3735.50 → 3736.30] all of these things
[3736.30 → 3736.84] are good
[3736.84 → 3737.80] and healthy
[3737.80 → 3738.92] and they're part
[3738.92 → 3740.94] of this cultural idea
[3740.94 → 3742.78] that floats around
[3742.78 → 3744.12] in the word of hope.
[3745.66 → 3746.56] In fact,
[3746.78 → 3749.06] in the field of education
[3749.06 → 3750.06] right now,
[3750.12 → 3750.90] there's all this
[3750.90 → 3752.82] perfect work
[3752.82 → 3753.48] and talk
[3753.48 → 3754.88] about growth mindset.
[3756.40 → 3757.78] We use this language
[3757.78 → 3758.44] in our own home,
[3758.80 → 3759.14] actually.
[3759.44 → 3759.56] Right?
[3759.58 → 3760.08] The idea
[3760.08 → 3761.28] that you are growing
[3761.28 → 3762.24] in understanding
[3762.24 → 3763.72] and growing in capacity
[3763.72 → 3764.98] and growing in ability.
[3764.98 → 3766.48] And so,
[3766.76 → 3768.40] when your kid says to you,
[3768.50 → 3769.84] I can't do this,
[3770.36 → 3771.56] we reframe it
[3771.56 → 3772.38] and we say,
[3772.58 → 3773.64] you're learning
[3773.64 → 3774.58] how to do this.
[3775.60 → 3775.82] Right?
[3775.86 → 3776.68] When someone says,
[3776.78 → 3777.50] I'm too shy
[3777.50 → 3778.82] to speak in front of people,
[3779.10 → 3780.04] we reframe it
[3780.04 → 3780.66] and we say,
[3781.04 → 3781.58] with practice
[3781.58 → 3782.34] and encouragement,
[3782.62 → 3783.36] I can become
[3783.36 → 3784.14] more confident
[3784.14 → 3785.08] and I can improve
[3785.08 → 3786.40] my public speaking skills.
[3788.22 → 3788.34] Right?
[3789.06 → 3790.18] Carol Deck
[3790.18 → 3791.80] is a leading researcher
[3791.80 → 3792.52] in this field.
[3792.62 → 3793.86] She's from Stanford University
[3793.86 → 3795.36] and she writes,
[3796.44 → 3797.82] in a growth mindset,
[3798.54 → 3799.24] people believe
[3799.24 → 3800.68] that their most basic abilities
[3800.68 → 3801.48] can be developed
[3801.48 → 3802.22] through dedication
[3802.22 → 3803.12] and hard work.
[3803.66 → 3804.68] Brains and talent
[3804.68 → 3806.56] are just the starting point.
[3808.64 → 3809.24] And so again,
[3809.62 → 3811.84] don't hear what I'm not saying
[3811.84 → 3813.34] because all of these
[3813.34 → 3814.70] are perfect examples
[3814.70 → 3815.98] and we can learn
[3815.98 → 3816.74] and be
[3816.74 → 3817.64] and do this
[3817.64 → 3818.96] and they come to us
[3818.96 → 3821.20] largely from the world today
[3821.20 → 3821.96] and our culture.
[3822.50 → 3823.54] All of them
[3823.54 → 3824.88] require
[3824.88 → 3827.60] an active definition
[3827.60 → 3829.50] or an active understanding
[3829.50 → 3829.96] though
[3829.96 → 3831.00] of hope.
[3832.46 → 3833.64] Hope that the way
[3833.64 → 3835.24] things currently are
[3835.24 → 3836.62] don't have to be
[3836.62 → 3837.38] the way things
[3837.38 → 3838.26] always will be.
[3840.84 → 3841.74] But whenever
[3841.74 → 3843.40] I look into
[3843.40 → 3844.56] these kinds of
[3844.56 → 3846.26] cultural understandings
[3846.26 → 3846.90] of ideas,
[3847.38 → 3848.84] I'm always left
[3848.84 → 3850.12] with the question,
[3851.12 → 3851.52] how?
[3851.52 → 3853.66] How can I have
[3853.66 → 3854.60] this kind of hope?
[3855.74 → 3855.88] Right?
[3855.94 → 3857.70] Or where does this
[3857.70 → 3858.72] kind of hope come from?
[3858.80 → 3859.88] What is it grounded in?
[3860.14 → 3860.68] And perhaps
[3860.68 → 3861.90] most importantly,
[3862.76 → 3863.48] why?
[3864.86 → 3866.20] Why is it true
[3866.20 → 3867.26] that things
[3867.26 → 3868.38] don't have to be
[3868.38 → 3869.76] the way they currently are?
[3871.12 → 3871.34] Right?
[3871.38 → 3872.22] It seems to me,
[3872.38 → 3873.14] strictly speaking,
[3873.40 → 3874.82] that unless we have
[3874.82 → 3876.04] a bigger idea
[3876.04 → 3877.10] than this world,
[3877.10 → 3878.24] all we can say
[3878.24 → 3879.12] with confidence
[3879.12 → 3880.32] is that things
[3880.32 → 3880.82] are the way
[3880.82 → 3881.62] they currently are.
[3883.32 → 3884.76] Not that they can be
[3884.76 → 3885.44] or that they have
[3885.44 → 3886.52] to be any different.
[3888.22 → 3889.10] In fact,
[3889.84 → 3890.92] I think that
[3890.92 → 3892.98] honest intellectuals
[3892.98 → 3893.76] outside the
[3893.76 → 3894.46] Christian tradition
[3894.46 → 3895.62] have recognized this.
[3896.58 → 3897.46] For instance,
[3897.62 → 3898.48] everyone's favourite
[3898.48 → 3899.62] modern philosopher,
[3900.02 → 3900.36] Nietzsche,
[3900.80 → 3901.20] says,
[3901.20 → 3903.40] hope in the world
[3903.40 → 3904.16] in reality
[3904.16 → 3905.10] is the worst
[3905.10 → 3905.90] of all evils
[3905.90 → 3907.18] because it prolongs
[3907.18 → 3908.10] the torments of man.
[3909.56 → 3909.94] Now,
[3910.00 → 3911.04] that's an extreme example
[3911.04 → 3911.94] and not all of us
[3911.94 → 3912.66] are nihilists.
[3913.30 → 3913.64] At least,
[3913.74 → 3914.70] I hope none of us here
[3914.70 → 3915.74] are nihilists
[3915.74 → 3916.46] even if we have
[3916.46 → 3917.24] some of those tendencies.
[3918.58 → 3918.84] And so,
[3918.92 → 3919.98] a less extreme example.
[3921.14 → 3922.12] In an essay
[3922.12 → 3922.64] called
[3922.64 → 3923.70] Secular Hope,
[3924.46 → 3925.38] John Weeks
[3925.38 → 3925.96] writes,
[3927.20 → 3928.44] the modest hope,
[3928.60 → 3929.32] notice he's already
[3929.32 → 3930.46] limiting his definition
[3930.46 → 3930.86] of hope.
[3930.94 → 3931.76] The modest hope
[3931.76 → 3933.10] rests on the possibility
[3933.10 → 3934.14] that we have
[3934.14 → 3935.02] some control
[3935.02 → 3935.98] over our lives
[3935.98 → 3937.32] and we can increase
[3937.32 → 3938.30] the control we have.
[3940.78 → 3940.96] Now,
[3940.98 → 3941.80] in this case,
[3941.92 → 3942.16] right,
[3942.28 → 3943.66] the why of hope
[3943.66 → 3945.28] rests on the idea
[3945.28 → 3945.94] that we have
[3945.94 → 3946.72] some control
[3946.72 → 3948.42] and that we can
[3948.42 → 3950.00] increase our control.
[3951.14 → 3952.28] But that's an awful
[3952.28 → 3953.06] big assumption
[3953.06 → 3954.38] about human autonomy
[3954.38 → 3955.34] and about our
[3955.34 → 3956.40] particular powers
[3956.40 → 3957.30] and prowess
[3957.30 → 3958.18] in the world.
[3958.46 → 3958.90] And,
[3959.12 → 3959.84] it ultimately
[3959.84 → 3960.92] still limits hope
[3960.92 → 3961.74] because it means
[3961.74 → 3962.68] that hope is limited
[3962.68 → 3963.24] to the things
[3963.24 → 3964.06] that I can control
[3964.06 → 3965.72] or things that I can
[3965.72 → 3966.76] reasonably hope
[3966.76 → 3967.34] to control
[3967.34 → 3968.30] in the future.
[3968.86 → 3970.02] But let's be honest,
[3970.08 → 3971.10] that's not satisfactory
[3971.10 → 3972.20] because when we need
[3972.20 → 3973.08] hope the most,
[3973.50 → 3974.66] things are out of control.
[3976.20 → 3976.72] And so,
[3976.78 → 3977.64] we need a different hope.
[3979.24 → 3979.72] Right?
[3979.80 → 3980.82] That kind of hope
[3980.82 → 3981.92] doesn't spur
[3981.92 → 3982.68] nations
[3982.68 → 3984.24] to great cultural
[3984.24 → 3984.84] productivity.
[3984.84 → 3986.18] That kind of hope
[3986.18 → 3987.10] doesn't change
[3987.10 → 3987.86] the world.
[3988.00 → 3988.84] That kind of hope
[3988.84 → 3990.42] isn't even
[3990.42 → 3991.46] what most people
[3991.46 → 3992.44] experience
[3992.44 → 3993.28] when they talk
[3993.28 → 3993.88] about hope.
[3995.12 → 3996.26] Hope in the Bible
[3996.26 → 3997.74] is something
[3997.74 → 3998.64] different.
[3998.82 → 3999.70] And the kind of hope
[3999.70 → 4000.26] that Isaiah
[4000.26 → 4001.46] is talking about here
[4001.46 → 4002.84] is different.
[4004.00 → 4004.40] Now,
[4004.46 → 4004.86] we started
[4004.86 → 4006.00] with that video
[4006.00 → 4006.62] and so we're not
[4006.62 → 4007.54] going to go through
[4007.54 → 4008.56] all of this again.
[4008.74 → 4008.94] But,
[4009.12 → 4010.38] in the Old Testament,
[4010.94 → 4011.54] there are
[4011.54 → 4012.76] three words
[4012.76 → 4013.64] that are primarily
[4013.64 → 4014.74] used for hope.
[4015.60 → 4015.90] And,
[4016.02 → 4017.30] I'm not going to give you
[4017.30 → 4018.30] every example of them
[4018.30 → 4019.38] but just some particular
[4019.38 → 4020.68] ones to make the point.
[4021.48 → 4022.64] The first word
[4022.64 → 4023.42] used for hope
[4023.42 → 4023.94] in Hebrew
[4023.94 → 4024.88] is racial.
[4025.16 → 4025.96] It's the word
[4025.96 → 4027.06] used by Job.
[4027.68 → 4028.80] You remember Job's story.
[4029.32 → 4029.42] Right?
[4029.52 → 4030.48] Job lost everything,
[4030.64 → 4031.50] suffered everything
[4031.50 → 4033.70] and near death.
[4034.10 → 4034.84] Job 13,
[4035.20 → 4035.90] Job says,
[4036.32 → 4038.04] though he slays me,
[4038.76 → 4040.04] I will hope
[4040.04 → 4041.18] in him.
[4042.76 → 4043.56] Right?
[4043.62 → 4044.06] Racial
[4044.06 → 4044.88] is the word
[4044.88 → 4046.54] used in Psalm 42.
[4047.58 → 4047.92] Right?
[4048.02 → 4048.62] Verse 11
[4048.62 → 4050.14] where the psalmist says,
[4050.24 → 4050.94] and this is familiar
[4050.94 → 4051.82] to many of you,
[4052.20 → 4053.36] Why, my soul,
[4053.48 → 4054.54] are you downcast?
[4055.04 → 4056.28] Why so disturbed
[4056.28 → 4056.80] within me?
[4056.94 → 4057.98] Put your hope
[4057.98 → 4059.00] in God
[4059.00 → 4060.18] for I will yet
[4060.18 → 4061.32] praise him.
[4062.14 → 4062.50] Right?
[4062.54 → 4063.66] This kind of hope
[4063.66 → 4064.82] is about waiting.
[4065.12 → 4066.18] It's about being patient
[4066.18 → 4067.08] in the midst
[4067.08 → 4068.36] of whatever is happening.
[4068.50 → 4069.30] It's about trusting
[4069.30 → 4070.04] that God
[4070.04 → 4070.86] has a purpose
[4070.86 → 4072.32] for this moment
[4072.32 → 4073.74] whatever it may be.
[4074.16 → 4074.28] Right?
[4074.38 → 4075.90] No amount of slaying
[4075.90 → 4076.76] or chaos
[4076.76 → 4078.40] of waves and breakers
[4078.40 → 4079.46] crashing over us
[4079.46 → 4080.96] in this particular experience.
[4081.34 → 4082.26] Whatever that may be,
[4082.40 → 4083.82] God has a purpose
[4083.82 → 4084.78] and so hope
[4084.78 → 4085.48] means we
[4085.48 → 4086.30] wait
[4086.30 → 4087.56] patiently.
[4090.14 → 4091.46] One of the other words
[4091.46 → 4092.46] used for hope
[4092.46 → 4093.14] is the word
[4093.14 → 4093.84] naval.
[4093.94 → 4094.48] That's the word
[4094.48 → 4095.42] that Isaiah uses
[4095.42 → 4096.16] that we've seen
[4096.16 → 4097.56] and it's the word
[4097.56 → 4098.98] that Jacob uses
[4098.98 → 4100.42] in Genesis 49
[4100.42 → 4102.00] when he says
[4102.00 → 4103.26] I will look
[4103.26 → 4104.88] for your deliverance
[4104.88 → 4105.58] Lord.
[4107.42 → 4108.62] I will look
[4108.62 → 4110.06] is that word
[4110.06 → 4111.08] hope.
[4111.34 → 4112.30] I will wait.
[4112.62 → 4113.80] I will anticipate.
[4114.38 → 4115.56] I will search out.
[4116.48 → 4116.58] Right?
[4116.76 → 4117.84] Hope involves
[4117.84 → 4118.26] waiting
[4118.26 → 4119.72] but with anticipation
[4119.72 → 4121.14] and it involves
[4121.14 → 4122.12] searching out
[4122.12 → 4122.90] the Lord
[4122.90 → 4123.62] and looking
[4123.62 → 4124.40] for the things
[4124.40 → 4124.88] in the midst
[4124.88 → 4125.62] of the unknown
[4125.62 → 4126.34] and whatever
[4126.34 → 4126.98] that experience
[4126.98 → 4127.48] may be.
[4127.48 → 4130.68] And the last word
[4130.68 → 4131.18] for hope
[4131.18 → 4133.20] is rival
[4133.20 → 4134.32] in Hebrew.
[4136.06 → 4136.78] If you live
[4136.78 → 4137.44] in this neighbourhood
[4137.44 → 4138.48] there's a barista
[4138.48 → 4139.14] at Starbucks
[4139.14 → 4139.62] over there
[4139.62 → 4140.64] whose name is rival
[4140.64 → 4142.30] and so if you ever
[4142.30 → 4143.18] go through the drive-thru
[4143.18 → 4144.24] and you see her name tag
[4144.24 → 4144.62] rival
[4144.62 → 4145.08] you can say
[4145.08 → 4145.70] hey hope
[4145.70 → 4146.30] how are you doing?
[4146.86 → 4147.96] She'll be really impressed.
[4148.10 → 4148.88] She was when I did it
[4148.88 → 4149.42] the last time.
[4153.94 → 4155.06] Jeremiah 29
[4155.06 → 4156.24] verse 11
[4156.24 → 4157.42] for I know
[4157.42 → 4157.98] the plans
[4157.98 → 4158.76] I have for you
[4158.76 → 4159.62] declares the Lord
[4159.62 → 4161.24] plans to prosper you
[4161.24 → 4162.18] and not to harm you
[4162.18 → 4163.34] plans to give you
[4163.34 → 4164.48] a rival
[4164.48 → 4166.62] and a future.
[4169.10 → 4170.48] God has a hope
[4170.48 → 4172.50] and we have a hope
[4172.50 → 4173.48] because of whom
[4173.48 → 4175.42] God is.
[4176.14 → 4176.64] And yes
[4176.64 → 4177.16] our hope
[4177.16 → 4178.24] involves waiting
[4178.24 → 4178.92] and it involves
[4178.92 → 4179.54] patience.
[4179.90 → 4180.22] Our hope
[4180.22 → 4180.96] also involves
[4180.96 → 4182.14] eagerly anticipating
[4182.14 → 4183.48] and being on the edge
[4183.48 → 4183.98] of our seats
[4183.98 → 4184.72] waiting for God
[4184.72 → 4185.14] to do
[4185.14 → 4185.70] what God
[4185.70 → 4186.36] is going to do
[4186.36 → 4187.40] and our hope
[4187.40 → 4189.28] is trusting.
[4191.88 → 4192.36] Trusting
[4192.36 → 4193.24] that God
[4193.24 → 4193.78] will do it.
[4195.22 → 4195.96] Now in the New Testament
[4195.96 → 4196.90] this idea
[4196.90 → 4197.94] carries
[4197.94 → 4199.18] forward.
[4199.38 → 4200.28] In the New Testament
[4200.28 → 4203.06] Paul writes
[4203.06 → 4203.80] he says
[4203.80 → 4205.40] in this hope
[4205.40 → 4206.96] we are saved.
[4208.28 → 4208.64] But hope
[4208.64 → 4209.32] that is seen
[4209.32 → 4210.02] is no hope
[4210.02 → 4210.40] at all.
[4210.72 → 4211.28] Who hopes
[4211.28 → 4211.72] for what they
[4211.72 → 4212.42] already have
[4212.42 → 4213.08] but if we
[4213.08 → 4213.76] hope for what
[4213.76 → 4214.34] we do not
[4214.34 → 4214.72] have
[4214.72 → 4215.66] we wait
[4215.66 → 4216.44] for it
[4216.44 → 4217.36] patiently.
[4218.54 → 4219.44] The New Testament
[4219.44 → 4220.24] the Greek word
[4220.24 → 4221.04] now for hope
[4221.04 → 4221.74] is Ellis
[4221.74 → 4222.22] and you see
[4222.22 → 4222.48] the way
[4222.48 → 4223.02] Paul uses
[4223.02 → 4223.40] it there
[4223.40 → 4224.04] it brings
[4224.04 → 4225.28] all of those
[4225.28 → 4226.38] Old Testament
[4226.38 → 4227.10] ideas
[4227.10 → 4228.04] of waiting
[4228.04 → 4228.86] and anticipating
[4228.86 → 4229.70] and trusting
[4229.70 → 4230.62] and looking
[4230.62 → 4231.18] to God
[4231.18 → 4231.70] together
[4231.70 → 4232.88] into one.
[4235.14 → 4236.06] The author
[4236.06 → 4236.58] of Hebrews
[4236.58 → 4237.18] continues
[4237.18 → 4238.72] instructing us
[4238.72 → 4238.92] saying
[4238.92 → 4239.72] let us hold
[4239.72 → 4241.04] unswervingly
[4241.04 → 4241.70] to the hope
[4241.70 → 4242.36] we profess
[4242.36 → 4243.18] for he
[4243.18 → 4244.06] who promised
[4244.06 → 4245.20] is faithful.
[4246.62 → 4247.34] So as we
[4247.34 → 4248.00] build on
[4248.00 → 4248.80] this idea
[4248.80 → 4249.70] of what hope
[4249.70 → 4250.36] is and what
[4250.36 → 4251.04] it can be
[4251.04 → 4251.62] for us
[4251.62 → 4252.30] in the world
[4252.30 → 4252.64] today
[4252.64 → 4253.28] as Christians
[4253.28 → 4254.16] who know
[4254.16 → 4254.54] God
[4254.54 → 4255.10] and are known
[4255.10 → 4255.60] by God
[4255.60 → 4256.12] as Christians
[4256.12 → 4256.80] who have seen
[4256.80 → 4257.16] God
[4257.16 → 4257.84] at work
[4257.84 → 4258.40] in the world
[4258.40 → 4258.76] through
[4258.76 → 4259.56] the Christmas
[4259.56 → 4260.08] story
[4260.08 → 4261.02] of God
[4261.02 → 4261.64] taking on
[4261.64 → 4262.00] flesh
[4262.00 → 4262.58] and coming
[4262.58 → 4263.32] as a baby
[4263.32 → 4263.76] the hope
[4263.76 → 4264.54] of nations
[4264.54 → 4265.52] fulfilled
[4265.52 → 4266.40] at that moment
[4266.40 → 4267.02] as we
[4267.02 → 4267.70] as Christians
[4267.70 → 4268.42] have seen
[4268.42 → 4269.48] this hope
[4269.48 → 4270.18] of nations
[4270.18 → 4270.60] grow
[4270.60 → 4271.16] and become
[4271.16 → 4271.64] obedient
[4271.64 → 4273.12] even unto
[4273.12 → 4273.60] death
[4273.60 → 4274.34] on the cross
[4274.34 → 4274.84] as we have
[4274.84 → 4275.90] the hope
[4275.90 → 4276.50] of Christmas
[4276.50 → 4277.16] turning
[4277.16 → 4278.74] into the hope
[4278.74 → 4279.54] and the joy
[4279.54 → 4280.40] of Good Friday
[4280.40 → 4281.50] and Easter
[4281.50 → 4283.80] we are called
[4283.80 → 4284.84] to hold
[4284.84 → 4286.46] unswervingly
[4286.46 → 4287.44] to the hope
[4287.44 → 4288.26] that we profess
[4288.26 → 4289.16] for he
[4289.16 → 4289.92] who promised
[4289.92 → 4291.14] is faithful
[4291.14 → 4292.70] and so notice
[4292.70 → 4293.00] right
[4293.00 → 4294.62] that hold
[4294.62 → 4295.76] unswervingly
[4295.76 → 4296.90] hope
[4296.90 → 4297.92] requires
[4297.92 → 4299.18] discipline
[4299.18 → 4301.18] hope requires
[4301.18 → 4302.34] a force
[4302.34 → 4303.18] of mind
[4303.18 → 4304.08] and of spirit
[4304.08 → 4305.02] and of will
[4305.02 → 4306.12] in the face
[4306.12 → 4307.08] of all those
[4307.08 → 4307.60] things
[4307.60 → 4308.44] that tell
[4308.44 → 4309.82] us to the contrary
[4309.82 → 4310.72] all those things
[4310.72 → 4311.70] that pull us
[4311.70 → 4312.62] into the darkness
[4312.62 → 4313.80] all those things
[4313.80 → 4314.86] that may slay
[4314.86 → 4316.18] us at the moment
[4316.18 → 4317.20] hope says
[4317.20 → 4318.12] I hold
[4318.12 → 4319.56] unswervingly
[4319.56 → 4320.98] to the truth
[4320.98 → 4322.80] to the truth
[4322.80 → 4323.50] that we
[4323.50 → 4324.70] profess
[4324.70 → 4325.36] let us hold
[4325.36 → 4326.00] unswervingly
[4326.00 → 4326.50] to the hope
[4326.50 → 4327.26] we profess
[4327.26 → 4328.26] hope
[4328.26 → 4329.86] of this kind
[4329.86 → 4330.72] requires
[4330.72 → 4331.60] a profession
[4331.60 → 4332.62] it requires
[4332.62 → 4333.42] a statement
[4333.42 → 4334.32] of belief
[4334.32 → 4334.98] it requires
[4334.98 → 4335.34] that we
[4335.34 → 4336.18] preach to
[4336.18 → 4336.64] ourselves
[4336.64 → 4337.66] even when
[4337.66 → 4338.58] our senses
[4338.58 → 4339.54] and everyone
[4339.54 → 4340.38] else in the world
[4340.38 → 4341.34] is telling you
[4341.34 → 4342.20] this or that
[4342.20 → 4342.54] thing
[4342.54 → 4343.50] we say
[4343.50 → 4344.46] I believe
[4344.46 → 4345.52] this is
[4345.52 → 4346.06] true
[4346.06 → 4346.90] I believe
[4346.90 → 4347.80] God is
[4347.80 → 4348.34] who God
[4348.34 → 4348.72] is
[4348.72 → 4349.08] and that
[4349.08 → 4349.52] what he
[4349.52 → 4350.30] has said
[4350.30 → 4351.28] will come
[4351.28 → 4352.00] about
[4352.00 → 4352.48] hope
[4352.48 → 4353.34] requires
[4353.34 → 4354.44] a profession
[4354.44 → 4355.40] but finally
[4355.40 → 4356.78] let us hold
[4356.78 → 4357.50] unswervingly
[4357.50 → 4357.98] to the hope
[4357.98 → 4358.56] we profess
[4358.56 → 4359.14] for he
[4359.14 → 4360.04] who promised
[4360.04 → 4360.88] is faithful
[4360.88 → 4363.76] he who promised
[4363.76 → 4365.36] is faithful
[4365.36 → 4367.72] the power
[4367.72 → 4369.02] of Christian
[4369.02 → 4369.52] hope
[4369.52 → 4371.12] the power
[4371.12 → 4372.24] the confidence
[4372.24 → 4373.52] that we have
[4373.52 → 4374.22] in our hope
[4374.22 → 4375.70] is not in
[4375.70 → 4376.14] one
[4376.14 → 4376.88] the strength
[4376.88 → 4377.82] of my discipline
[4377.82 → 4379.56] or the intensity
[4379.56 → 4380.54] of my discipline
[4380.54 → 4381.06] though we are
[4381.06 → 4381.86] required to have it
[4381.86 → 4383.10] it's not in two
[4383.10 → 4384.18] the strength
[4384.18 → 4384.90] or the scope
[4384.90 → 4385.82] of my profession
[4385.82 → 4386.82] though we are
[4386.82 → 4387.78] required to make it
[4387.78 → 4389.04] to declare it boldly
[4389.04 → 4390.10] the strength
[4390.10 → 4390.68] of my hope
[4390.68 → 4391.32] the truth
[4391.32 → 4392.56] of our conviction
[4392.56 → 4393.74] is in
[4393.74 → 4394.92] the person
[4394.92 → 4396.12] who promised
[4396.12 → 4397.44] for he
[4397.44 → 4398.36] who promised
[4398.36 → 4399.86] is faithful
[4399.86 → 4402.02] biblical hope
[4402.02 → 4402.52] is not based
[4402.52 → 4403.72] on your circumstances
[4403.72 → 4404.46] or how much
[4404.46 → 4405.12] control
[4405.12 → 4406.26] you may have
[4406.26 → 4407.00] or reasonably
[4407.00 → 4408.20] assume you can have
[4408.20 → 4409.00] in the world
[4409.00 → 4409.80] but it is based
[4409.80 → 4410.78] on the person
[4410.78 → 4411.36] of God
[4411.36 → 4412.60] who has promised
[4412.60 → 4413.20] for you
[4413.20 → 4414.30] a certain
[4414.30 → 4415.82] future
[4415.82 → 4418.70] and so we go
[4418.70 → 4419.52] from this
[4419.52 → 4420.22] place
[4420.22 → 4422.22] hope
[4422.22 → 4423.04] filled
[4423.04 → 4424.60] to be
[4424.60 → 4425.20] full
[4425.20 → 4426.80] of hope
[4426.80 → 4427.98] in the world
[4427.98 → 4430.56] as we've said
[4430.56 → 4431.18] a number of times
[4431.18 → 4431.86] already this morning
[4431.86 → 4433.02] in this
[4433.02 → 4434.34] present darkness
[4434.34 → 4436.60] we light a candle
[4436.60 → 4438.60] hope
[4438.60 → 4440.42] is the candle
[4440.42 → 4441.82] that changes
[4441.82 → 4442.42] the world
[4442.42 → 4443.64] hope
[4443.64 → 4444.42] is that little
[4444.42 → 4445.18] bit of light
[4445.18 → 4446.42] that pierces
[4446.42 → 4446.84] out
[4446.84 → 4447.98] and separates
[4447.98 → 4448.86] darkness
[4448.86 → 4449.44] hope
[4449.44 → 4450.32] is what
[4450.32 → 4450.80] people
[4450.80 → 4451.88] will see
[4451.88 → 4452.50] and will
[4452.50 → 4453.10] wonder
[4453.10 → 4453.94] how
[4453.94 → 4455.02] on this
[4455.02 → 4455.64] earth
[4455.64 → 4457.46] can you
[4457.46 → 4458.10] have hope
[4458.10 → 4462.10] no
[4462.10 → 4465.26] hope
[4465.26 → 4466.54] can still
[4466.54 → 4467.22] be hard
[4467.22 → 4470.78] in the video
[4470.78 → 4471.32] we watched
[4471.32 → 4472.18] Tim Mickey
[4472.18 → 4472.72] says
[4472.72 → 4474.18] Christian hope
[4474.18 → 4475.04] looks back
[4475.04 → 4476.10] to the risen
[4476.10 → 4476.52] Jesus
[4476.52 → 4477.32] in order
[4477.32 → 4478.40] to look forward
[4478.40 → 4479.96] in this
[4479.96 → 4480.66] present moment
[4480.66 → 4482.44] the table
[4482.44 → 4483.86] is us
[4483.86 → 4484.66] doing that
[4484.66 → 4486.20] we look
[4486.20 → 4486.64] back
[4486.64 → 4487.42] and we
[4487.42 → 4487.90] remember
[4487.90 → 4488.52] the death
[4488.52 → 4488.88] and the
[4488.88 → 4489.30] resurrection
[4489.30 → 4489.82] of Jesus
[4489.82 → 4490.30] Christ
[4490.30 → 4491.14] in order
[4491.14 → 4491.94] that from
[4491.94 → 4492.64] here we
[4492.64 → 4493.12] can be
[4493.12 → 4493.64] filled
[4493.64 → 4495.06] with hope
[4495.06 → 4496.30] in order
[4496.30 → 4496.84] that from
[4496.84 → 4497.38] here we
[4497.38 → 4497.70] can be
[4497.70 → 4498.34] filled
[4498.34 → 4499.34] by God
[4499.34 → 4499.98] and nourished
[4499.98 → 4500.46] by him
[4500.46 → 4501.88] right
[4501.88 → 4502.62] this isn't
[4502.62 → 4503.22] simply
[4503.22 → 4504.20] a remembrance
[4504.20 → 4506.04] but this
[4506.04 → 4506.32] is an
[4506.32 → 4506.80] act of
[4506.80 → 4507.06] God
[4507.06 → 4507.42] where he
[4507.42 → 4508.22] meets us
[4508.22 → 4508.66] at the
[4508.66 → 4509.04] table
[4509.04 → 4510.04] and sends
[4510.04 → 4510.68] us out
[4510.68 → 4511.06] in the
[4511.06 → 4511.50] power
[4511.50 → 4512.98] of hope
[4512.98 → 4514.10] this is
[4514.10 → 4515.06] a celebration
[4515.06 → 4515.76] of what
[4515.76 → 4516.26] God has
[4516.26 → 4516.56] done
[4516.56 → 4517.06] and so
[4517.06 → 4517.86] as we
[4517.86 → 4518.48] come to
[4518.48 → 4519.40] this table
[4519.40 → 4520.52] come as
[4520.52 → 4521.70] those longing
[4521.70 → 4523.32] for hope
[4523.32 → 4523.94] come as
[4523.94 → 4524.40] those who
[4524.40 → 4524.86] recognize
[4524.86 → 4525.72] that we
[4525.72 → 4526.52] need
[4526.52 → 4527.24] this
[4527.24 → 4528.00] hope
[4528.00 → 4528.72] come as
[4528.72 → 4529.56] those who
[4529.56 → 4530.38] will
[4530.38 → 4531.16] be
[4531.16 → 4532.04] filled
[4532.04 → 4533.68] as we
[4533.68 → 4533.94] come to
[4533.94 → 4534.36] this table
[4534.36 → 4534.84] we come
[4534.84 → 4535.64] with a
[4535.64 → 4536.02] liturgy
[4536.02 → 4536.76] I'm going
[4536.76 → 4537.04] to invite
[4537.04 → 4537.30] you to
[4537.30 → 4537.68] speak the
[4537.68 → 4538.06] words
[4538.06 → 4539.28] of our
[4539.28 → 4539.96] approaching
[4539.96 → 4540.74] the table
[4540.74 → 4541.64] together
[4541.64 → 4543.20] lift
[4543.20 → 4543.72] your hearts

[5273.78 → 5280.04] What heart could fathom such boundless grace
[5280.04 → 5285.56] The God of ages stepped down from glory
[5285.56 → 5291.12] To wear my sin and bear my shame
[5291.12 → 5296.92] The cross has spoken, I am forgiven
[5296.92 → 5302.56] The King of Kings calls me His own
[5303.12 → 5308.36] Beautiful Saviour, I'm yours forever
[5308.36 → 5314.30] Jesus Christ, my living home

[5364.50 → 5367.78] That sealed the promise
[5367.78 → 5370.44] Your buried body
[5370.44 → 5373.04] Began to breathe
[5373.04 → 5376.56] Out of the silence
[5376.56 → 5379.32] The roaring lion
[5379.32 → 5381.76] Declared the grave
[5381.76 → 5384.74] Has no shame on me
[5384.74 → 5387.78] Then came the morning
[5387.78 → 5390.74] That sealed the promise
[5390.74 → 5392.74] Your buried body
[5392.74 → 5393.74] Your buried body
[5393.74 → 5395.74] Began to breathe
[5395.74 → 5399.74] Out of the silence
[5399.74 → 5401.74] The roaring lion
[5401.74 → 5404.74] Declared the grave
[5404.74 → 5407.74] Has no claim on me
[5407.74 → 5412.74] Jesus, your dilatory
[5412.74 → 5420.12] Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free
[5420.12 → 5421.12] Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
[5421.12 → 5425.12] Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
[5425.12 → 5426.12] Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
[5426.12 → 5428.12] You have broken every chain
[5428.12 → 5431.12] There's salvation in your name
[5431.12 → 5436.12] Jesus Christ, my living home
[5436.12 → 5442.12] Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free
[5442.12 → 5447.12] Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
[5447.12 → 5448.12] You have broken every chain
[5448.12 → 5449.12] You have broken every chain
[5449.12 → 5450.12] You have broken every chain
[5450.12 → 5452.12] There's salvation in your name
[5452.12 → 5454.12] Jesus Christ, my living home
[5454.12 → 5458.12] Jesus Christ, my living home
[5458.12 → 5463.12] Jesus Christ, my living home
[5463.12 → 5468.12] Oh God, you are my living home
[5468.12 → 5477.12] You have broken every chain
[5477.12 → 5481.12] You have broken every chain
[5481.12 → 5485.12] You have broken every chain
[5485.12 → 5506.12] You have broken every chain
[5506.12 → 5511.84] I lift my eyes up to the mountains.
[5511.84 → 5516.12] Where does my help come from?
[5518.20 → 5529.02] My help comes from you, maker of heaven, creator of the earth.
[5529.02 → 5540.00] Oh, how I need you, Lord. You are my only home. You're my only friend.
[5542.00 → 5551.36] So I will pray for you to come and rescue me. Come and give me love.
[5551.36 → 5563.18] I lift my eyes up to the mountains. Where does my help come from?

[5597.36 → 5609.54] I lift my eyes up to the mountains. Where does my help come from?
[5609.54 → 5639.52] I lift my eyes up to the mountains.

[5703.64 → 5707.64] When I hold down.
[5707.64 → 5711.64] All through the storm.

[5832.64 → 5840.64] My hope is in you alone.
[5840.64 → 5855.64] As we conclude our time at the table, I'm going to invite you to stand and we can pray together.
[5855.64 → 5867.64] Amazing God.
[5867.64 → 5876.64] You have come into our ordinary everyday lives to set a holy table among us.
[5876.64 → 5882.64] Filling our plates with the bread of life and our cups with your salvation.
[5882.64 → 5890.64] Send us out, oh God, with a tender-heartedness to touch an ordinary everyday world.
[5890.64 → 5894.64] With the promise of your holiness and hope.
[5894.64 → 5896.64] In Jesus name we pray.
