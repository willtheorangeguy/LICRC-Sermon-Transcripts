[0.00 --> 10.44]  As you guys have noticed, we had the college draws early with the college tables there.
[10.44 --> 15.12]  Every year at reactivate we invite these colleges to come and sponsor our event to help us keep
[15.12 --> 19.48]  costs down but also because we love them to interact with our students and to have them
[19.48 --> 24.12]  talk with our students and hopefully our students will go to some Christian higher education. So if
[24.12 --> 27.78]  you're a parent here today this morning you're welcome to talk to them and learn more about
[27.78 --> 32.70]  those institutions as well. And this morning we have Calvin University. This is the first time Calvin
[32.70 --> 37.44]  has sponsored and been here so we're happy to have Calvin. I'm gonna hand it off to Ryan to share about Calvin.
[37.44 --> 47.54]  Thank you so much Curtis. So first off for any like members or people that come to like Langley,
[47.54 --> 54.96]  Emanuel, CRC, I hope every Sunday starts like this. This is the coolest church like like moment I've
[54.96 --> 60.84]  had. So super glad to be here from Calvin. Calvin is our CRC liberal arts university all the way in
[60.84 --> 66.18]  Grand Rapids, Michigan. This is my first time to Vancouver. Really glad to be here. But I think a
[66.18 --> 72.30]  really cool thing for Calvin is that our mission has stayed the same through about 150 years and
[72.30 --> 77.16]  it's that we want to teach students to think deeply, act justly, live wholeheartedly as Christ's agents of
[77.16 --> 82.32]  renewal. And it's not just something for students, this is something for all of communities, right? When I visit
[82.32 --> 87.66]  schools or churches, especially CRC churches, this is the mission we hold to. How do we think deeply
[87.66 --> 93.42]  about the world, right? How do we take the passions God has given us and see how we can like dive deeper
[93.42 --> 98.50]  into those, dive deeper into scripture, dive deeper into the calling he has for us. Act justly. How do we
[98.50 --> 104.58]  live that out? How do we as a church here in Vancouver or Grand Rapids or Texas, how do we act justly?
[104.64 --> 108.50]  How do we bring to light those things that we're thinking about? So as students, like if you're thinking
[108.50 --> 112.02]  about what are the passions I have, what are the things that I am thinking about that I might want
[112.02 --> 116.78]  to study or what are the jobs I want to go into, you're going to be able to to bring God's justice
[116.78 --> 122.20]  and kingdom into all of the different things no matter what your passion is, no matter if you go
[122.20 --> 126.92]  to university or you choose trade school or you do none of those, right? Like we always have that call
[126.92 --> 132.08]  to act justly. And then I think that brings us to living wholeheartedly. Like one of the cool things
[132.08 --> 136.04]  in students, I hope you reflect on this moment the rest of your school year, is you think about,
[136.04 --> 140.96]  man, this community you've made, right? Living wholeheartedly is bringing people together.
[141.18 --> 146.30]  And that's such a heartbeat for Calvin. That's a heartbeat for the CRC is how can we as a community,
[146.76 --> 151.16]  right, like live out the mission of Christ where we've been planted, right? You guys are all going
[151.16 --> 154.44]  to go back to the churches you're from, the youth groups you're from, the schools you're from,
[154.44 --> 160.04]  but you still have this community and this moment to live into. And that's such a desire for Calvin
[160.04 --> 165.62]  to foster that. And it's all wrapped together as being an agent of renewal in Christ, right? Like that's
[165.62 --> 171.70]  the movement that we have as Christians, is that we're bringing that love into the world. Tim, who
[171.70 --> 177.76]  did an excellent job speaking this weekend and his wife Charity, they talked about like, are you going
[177.76 --> 184.12]  to live differently? Are you going to proclaim the kingdom? Are you going to showcase Christ in your
[184.12 --> 188.50]  life? And that's the challenge we have for you guys that are here for this conference, but that's the
[188.50 --> 193.22]  challenge we ask of all of our students at Calvin is like, how are you going to live that out? How are you
[193.22 --> 197.70]  going to proclaim that? How are you going to bring that to all the places that you're from? So that's
[197.70 --> 202.26]  a big heartbeat for Calvin. We're really glad to be at any of the CRC churches. We're always glad when
[202.26 --> 206.98]  we host them in Grand Rapids, but it's great to be able to be out and hanging out with you. So like
[206.98 --> 212.64]  all the adults in the rooms, like so glad you guys are here to support the students. This has been an
[212.64 --> 217.64]  amazing weekend. So your guys like hosting this is excellent. We've got one video that's about Calvin,
[217.72 --> 222.34]  about going beyond. And then I think that's like going to slide us right into church service. So
[222.34 --> 226.52]  thanks for having myself, Trinity and Redeemer here, as well as all of these excellent students.
[229.34 --> 237.30]  Where will the next revolutionary idea come from? That next breakthrough in scientific research
[237.30 --> 248.76]  or that next literary masterpiece? At Calvin University, you can dream bigger, think deeper, aim higher.
[252.34 --> 260.76]  Our world-class faculty push students to keep asking hard questions and never settle for the status quo.
[261.34 --> 270.34]  Become part of the solution to the world's big problems. Become part of a university that challenges students
[270.34 --> 279.34]  to go beyond themselves as Christ's agents of renewal in the world. Calvin University, go beyond.
[279.34 --> 280.34]  Be beyond.
[280.34 --> 281.34]  Be beyond.
[281.34 --> 282.34]  Be beyond.
[282.34 --> 286.34]  Be beyond.

[351.80 --> 357.22]  Let me not be blind with privilege.
[357.22 --> 363.26]  Give me eyes to see the pain.

[369.74 --> 374.34]  Not be spent on me in vain.

[380.22 --> 386.48]  I will go, I will go, I will go, Lord.
[386.74 --> 391.94]  Send me to the world, to the lost, to the poor.
[392.94 --> 396.24]  Hungry, take everything I am.
[396.64 --> 399.06]  I'm great within your hands.
[399.06 --> 401.58]  I will go, I will go.
[405.52 --> 406.00]  Good.
[406.12 --> 406.60]  Wow.
[406.78 --> 407.44]  There it is.
[407.56 --> 409.66]  Good morning, everyone.
[409.82 --> 413.34]  Good morning, Reactivate Youth leaders who are here this weekend.
[413.56 --> 415.80]  And good morning, Emanuel CRC.
[416.18 --> 420.90]  This is such a cool time, such a cool service that we have here.
[420.90 --> 422.78]  Because I want to actually Reactivate Youth.
[422.78 --> 429.88]  Look behind you and just see that we are joined now by members of not just Emanuel CIC, but members of other churches as well.
[430.32 --> 435.94]  And it is so cool to be able to do this church service, not just as youth and leaders, but as the body of Christ.
[436.34 --> 441.82]  And Emanuel, take a peek in front of you at the over 200 youth and leaders who have come.
[442.20 --> 444.38]  And they are going to worship with us today.
[444.92 --> 448.10]  And I just think this is a beautiful picture of the body of Christ.
[448.10 --> 453.84]  And so it is so cool that we can gather together in this place and do this service in this way.
[454.24 --> 457.02]  For those who, I mean, all of you I think know who I am.
[457.08 --> 457.66]  I'm Kevin Loverd.
[457.68 --> 458.80]  I'm the youth pastor here.
[458.92 --> 464.40]  And I'm going to invite Pastor Chris, who is our lead pastor, to lead us in our opening welcome.
[465.72 --> 466.36]  Good morning.
[467.74 --> 468.42]  Let's try it again.
[468.46 --> 468.92]  Good morning.
[470.02 --> 471.24]  Hey, there we go.
[472.12 --> 474.54]  Welcome to Emanuel yet again.
[474.54 --> 478.00]  I had a chance to welcome you guys here on Friday night.
[478.50 --> 481.82]  And to the Emanuel people, welcome to church.
[481.92 --> 483.00]  This weekend has been awesome.
[483.20 --> 488.94]  It's been really great to connect and to see, to be part of the Learn It's yesterday, and to hear some of your stories.
[489.42 --> 492.48]  What a huge blessing for me and for our church community.
[493.02 --> 496.36]  I hope and pray that it was a huge blessing for you.
[497.10 --> 500.44]  If you're joining us online, things look a little bit differently in here.
[500.54 --> 503.22]  And we're excited that you are here as well.
[503.22 --> 507.38]  Before we begin, just a couple church announcements to make.
[508.34 --> 511.60]  And so everyone is invited to stick around afterwards for fellowship.
[511.82 --> 512.38]  There's coffee.
[512.86 --> 519.74]  I believe there's a bunch of, like, fruit and other refreshments that are left over from the weekend that you guys are providing for us.
[519.76 --> 520.56]  So thank you for that.
[521.02 --> 525.58]  And so stick around in the fellowship hall or in the courtyard or outside and the like.
[525.78 --> 527.78]  Please enjoy that time together.
[527.78 --> 537.24]  As well, just a reminder that this coming Tuesday night, we have our first full council meeting of the ministry season.
[537.42 --> 540.94]  And so full council members, you are on notice.
[541.08 --> 542.50]  You've received an agenda for that.
[542.60 --> 545.02]  That's happening Tuesday night at 730.
[545.02 --> 548.18]  I think that's it for ordinary announcements.
[548.18 --> 551.32]  And so what I would like to do now is invite you all to stand.
[551.92 --> 556.82]  And we're going to be ushered into God's presence by receiving his greeting.
[557.58 --> 562.56]  Now, as we receive God's greeting, I'm going to invite you to take a posture of receipt.
[562.56 --> 567.00]  And so maybe that looks like hands out and open in front of you.
[567.12 --> 570.86]  Maybe that looks like up to your chest or prayer with your eyes closed.
[571.14 --> 575.28]  Whoever that looks, know that God meets us in this place.
[576.12 --> 580.46]  And that in worship, he is especially present in his spirit.
[581.12 --> 583.12]  And we are filled by him.
[583.78 --> 586.30]  And so we receive his greeting.
[586.30 --> 595.48]  Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son, and our Savior.
[596.14 --> 599.04]  Through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[599.44 --> 600.00]  Everyone said?
[600.64 --> 601.04]  Amen.
[602.02 --> 606.90]  Now, we have a practice here where you turn and welcome other people into worship.
[607.14 --> 610.20]  Now, there's an ancient historical way of doing that.
[610.70 --> 612.84]  And that's greeting each other with a holy kiss.
[612.84 --> 618.08]  We're not going to do that because we've already seen what happened with the breath contest.
[619.10 --> 621.66]  But I'm going to invite you to turn to those around you.
[621.76 --> 625.60]  Maybe shake their hand or give them a fist bump or just a nod of the head.
[625.78 --> 628.24]  And say, the peace of Christ be with you.
[628.24 --> 629.24]  Amen.
[642.84 --> 661.80]  Thank you.
[661.98 --> 662.84]  Hold on.
[662.88 --> 667.04]  Thank you.
[667.04 --> 671.86]  Thank you.
[671.86 --> 680.86]  I can see the words.
[680.86 --> 685.86]  Okay, so someone says,
[685.86 --> 688.86]  I can understand that the cherry would be just this tall.
[688.86 --> 692.86]  I can see the words.
[692.86 --> 698.86]  Okay, so someone says,
[698.86 --> 708.86]  I can see the words.
[708.86 --> 711.86]  People of God, sing to the Lord all the earth.
[711.86 --> 715.86]  Proclaim his salvation day after day.
[715.86 --> 718.86]  Declare his glory among the nations
[718.86 --> 722.86]  and his marvelous deeds among all peoples.
[722.86 --> 727.86]  For great is the Lord and most worthy of praise.

[812.36 --> 816.88]  Come to the table, He will satisfy

[832.22 --> 837.06]  His heart and hope, He's done to save us
[837.06 --> 842.80]  Whoever believes in Him will live forever

[1300.84 --> 1306.84]  This is the message we have heard and declare to you.
[1306.84 --> 1309.84]  God is light.
[1309.84 --> 1311.84]  In him there is no darkness at all.
[1311.84 --> 1318.84]  And if we claim to have fellowship with him and yet walk in darkness, we lie and do not live out the truth.
[1318.84 --> 1325.84]  But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another.
[1325.84 --> 1330.84]  And the blood of Jesus, his son, purifies us from all our sin.

[1723.02 --> 1729.02]  Shed for us his precious blood.
[1729.02 --> 1735.02]  Who his love will not remember.
[1735.02 --> 1741.02]  Who can cease to sing his praise.
[1741.02 --> 1748.02]  He can never be forgotten.
[1748.02 --> 1754.02]  Throughout heaven's eternal days.
[1754.02 --> 1769.02]  And on the mount of crucifixion.
[1769.02 --> 1799.02]

[1813.02 --> 1818.02]  Who his love will not remember.
[1818.02 --> 1825.02]  Who can cease to sing his praise.
[1825.02 --> 1830.02]  He can never be forgotten.
[1830.02 --> 1837.02]  Who has eternal days.

[1878.70 --> 1881.70]  Thy kingdom only
[1881.70 --> 1886.84]  And my life eternal
[1886.84 --> 1894.36]  Thou alone shall be my glory
[1894.36 --> 1900.34]  Nothing in the world I see
[1900.34 --> 1906.64]  Thou hast friends and sanctified me
[1906.64 --> 1912.68]  Thou alone hast set me free
[1912.68 --> 1918.58]  Thou alone shall be my glory
[1918.58 --> 1924.56]  Nothing in this world I see
[1924.56 --> 1930.58]  Thou hast friends and sanctified me
[1930.58 --> 1936.58]  Thou alone shall set me free
[1936.58 --> 1942.56]  Thou alone shall set me free
[1942.56 --> 1952.56]  Thou alone shall set me free
[1952.56 --> 1966.56]  Thou alone shall set me free
[1966.56 --> 1970.56]  Thou alone shall set me free
[1970.56 --> 1974.56]  Thou alone shall set me free
[1974.56 --> 2004.54]  Thou alone shall set me free
[2004.54 --> 2007.54]  My name is Brenda and I'm a deacon here at Emmanuel
[2007.54 --> 2010.52]  It's good to see all of you here this morning
[2010.52 --> 2012.52]  And I'm assuming you've had a good weekend
[2012.52 --> 2017.32]  Our offering this morning is for our budget
[2017.32 --> 2020.48]  For the church here for ministries and such
[2020.48 --> 2022.52]  And we have a special offering as well
[2022.52 --> 2025.52]  And this morning it is for name
[2025.52 --> 2032.52]  And I am happy to welcome Tim and Charity Johnson
[2032.52 --> 2036.52]  And they're going to tell us a bit about their work with name
[2036.52 --> 2038.52]  You have your own, okay
[2038.52 --> 2040.52]  Good morning
[2040.52 --> 2042.52]  Good morning, good morning, Langley Emmanuel
[2042.52 --> 2044.52]  Good morning, Reactivate
[2044.52 --> 2048.52]  This will be a recap for all you Reactivate kids
[2048.52 --> 2050.52]  Unless you were sleeping the first night
[2050.52 --> 2053.16]  Then this will be brand new and fresh
[2053.16 --> 2056.64]  Our names are Tim and Charity Johnson
[2056.64 --> 2060.52]  We get to serve with North America Indigenous Ministries
[2060.52 --> 2063.60]  We serve the Sequetmik people, the Shushwap people
[2063.60 --> 2067.40]  First Nations people up in the Shushwap area
[2067.40 --> 2069.08]  Up in Salmon Arm, Chase area
[2069.08 --> 2072.00]  We have two of our kids with us today
[2072.00 --> 2075.14]  And the other two are back at home
[2075.14 --> 2078.32]  A lot of people have been asking about the fires
[2078.32 --> 2081.46]  The fires have been raging through our area
[2081.46 --> 2082.64]  As we were driving out
[2082.64 --> 2084.80]  It was like five minutes down the road from our place
[2084.80 --> 2086.92]  As we were coming out on Friday
[2086.92 --> 2089.98]  They were still dumping water on the mountainsides
[2089.98 --> 2091.28]  And still putting out fires
[2091.28 --> 2093.76]  So keep that in your prayer
[2093.76 --> 2097.28]  There's still a lot of people that are living in fear
[2097.28 --> 2101.86]  And terrified because it has destroyed a lot of homes
[2101.86 --> 2103.40]  And a lot of property
[2103.40 --> 2106.18]  One of the neighboring communities
[2106.18 --> 2107.88]  Little Shushwap Indian Bend
[2107.88 --> 2110.22]  They lost like 80 houses
[2110.22 --> 2112.48]  And a gas station
[2112.48 --> 2114.90]  A bunch of other buildings as well
[2114.90 --> 2118.46]  So it's neat to see how the communities
[2118.46 --> 2119.94]  Are trying to rally around
[2119.94 --> 2122.62]  And trying to support and help
[2122.62 --> 2124.24]  And so we're right in there
[2124.24 --> 2126.92]  And looking for ways to be able to help people
[2126.92 --> 2129.72]  Support people as they journey through the process
[2129.72 --> 2131.88]  Of going through insurance
[2131.88 --> 2135.30]  Going through getting some of these different things covered
[2135.30 --> 2137.60]  And then just covering people in prayer
[2137.60 --> 2142.34]  There's a big need for hope right now
[2142.34 --> 2145.80]  So that's the big message that we've been preaching
[2145.80 --> 2147.56]  And we've been sharing with people
[2147.56 --> 2149.76]  But mostly coming alongside people
[2150.28 --> 2151.62]  Loving them where they're at
[2151.62 --> 2153.72]  And just journeying through that with them
[2153.72 --> 2156.08]  As well as trying to support the community
[2156.08 --> 2157.22]  As best as possible
[2157.22 --> 2161.60]  So my part a lot to do
[2161.60 --> 2162.98]  Is with the girls group
[2162.98 --> 2163.94]  On the reserve
[2163.94 --> 2166.92]  But Tim and I work simultaneously together
[2166.92 --> 2167.96]  And with our kids
[2167.96 --> 2169.48]  And we
[2169.48 --> 2170.66]  I guess
[2170.66 --> 2171.92]  We just kind of
[2171.92 --> 2173.50]  Give them a childhood
[2173.50 --> 2175.36]  And we support the parents
[2175.36 --> 2176.80]  In the best ways we can
[2176.80 --> 2179.20]  And we just come alongside the community
[2179.20 --> 2180.74]  However that might look
[2180.74 --> 2181.74]  And if Chiefing Council
[2181.74 --> 2183.66]  Or other
[2183.66 --> 2185.00]  Like counselors
[2185.00 --> 2186.32]  Or addictions workers
[2186.32 --> 2186.82]  Or anyone
[2186.82 --> 2188.12]  Needs us
[2188.12 --> 2189.40]  Then we just plunk in
[2189.40 --> 2191.14]  And help out however we can
[2191.14 --> 2193.50]  I'm really excited to share with you
[2193.50 --> 2195.30]  Actually some of the youth
[2195.30 --> 2197.08]  That we've gotten together with
[2197.08 --> 2198.20]  Since they were just little
[2198.20 --> 2199.18]  Are now
[2199.18 --> 2201.64]  All your guys' age
[2201.64 --> 2202.72]  At Reactivate here
[2202.72 --> 2204.22]  And one of the girls
[2204.22 --> 2206.24]  Was invited to go to
[2206.24 --> 2207.40]  Thompson Rivers University
[2207.40 --> 2209.14]  To talk about truth and reconciliation
[2209.14 --> 2210.76]  With other
[2210.76 --> 2213.34]  Other
[2213.34 --> 2215.48]  Bands
[2215.48 --> 2216.52]  And communities
[2216.52 --> 2217.24]  And
[2217.24 --> 2219.24]  Other youth were invited
[2219.24 --> 2220.22]  That were her age
[2220.22 --> 2221.76]  And she came back
[2221.76 --> 2222.94]  To girls group one night
[2222.94 --> 2224.00]  And just shared with us
[2224.00 --> 2224.34]  Like
[2224.34 --> 2225.28]  You guys
[2225.28 --> 2226.74]  They were really excited
[2226.74 --> 2227.50]  To hear about
[2227.50 --> 2228.24]  What we do
[2228.24 --> 2229.12]  With our youth group
[2229.12 --> 2229.78]  And what we do
[2229.78 --> 2230.60]  In our community
[2230.60 --> 2231.42]  And they're like
[2231.42 --> 2231.84]  Whoa
[2231.84 --> 2233.54]  We would love to do that
[2233.54 --> 2234.48]  We wish we could
[2234.48 --> 2234.88]  You know
[2234.88 --> 2235.60]  Do those things
[2235.60 --> 2236.34]  And she's like
[2236.34 --> 2236.62]  You guys
[2236.62 --> 2237.76]  We got it really good
[2237.76 --> 2239.44]  And she was just like
[2239.44 --> 2240.08]  An inspiration
[2240.08 --> 2241.02]  For all the others
[2241.02 --> 2241.34]  Like
[2241.34 --> 2242.02]  Hey
[2242.02 --> 2243.22]  We're doing good
[2243.22 --> 2244.26]  And it was nice
[2244.26 --> 2245.74]  For her to be able to
[2245.74 --> 2247.08]  Be invited there
[2247.08 --> 2247.80]  Go there
[2247.80 --> 2248.74]  She's being put into
[2248.74 --> 2249.94]  More leadership positions
[2249.94 --> 2251.18]  And we just praise God
[2251.18 --> 2251.66]  For her
[2251.66 --> 2252.12]  So
[2252.12 --> 2254.36]  We thank you guys

[2256.54 --> 2257.14]  And your prayers
[2257.14 --> 2258.80]  Without your prayers
[2258.80 --> 2260.22]  We'd be dead in the water
[2260.22 --> 2261.44]  We need God
[2261.44 --> 2262.38]  Backing us up
[2262.38 --> 2263.98]  And we need to be working
[2263.98 --> 2265.34]  Through his spirit
[2265.34 --> 2266.52]  As well
[2266.52 --> 2266.82]  So
[2266.82 --> 2268.52]  It is amazing
[2268.52 --> 2269.88]  To be able to do

[2562.86 --> 2564.88]  Jesus
[2583.52 --> 2602.20]  I would love to invite any kids from Emanuel
[2602.20 --> 2606.32]  If you're three-ish years old or up to kindergarten-ish age
[2606.32 --> 2608.30]  Why don't you come up all the way to the front
[2608.30 --> 2610.14]  You can come sit up here with me
[2610.14 --> 2613.12]  Come on forward, come on forward
[2613.12 --> 2614.06]  Good job
[2614.06 --> 2616.80]  There's some more coming from the side I see
[2616.80 --> 2618.72]  That's good
[2618.72 --> 2625.36]  What do you think of all of the lights here today?
[2626.22 --> 2626.98]  Isn't it cool?
[2627.86 --> 2628.04]  Yeah?
[2628.24 --> 2630.18]  We have some teaching to do this morning
[2630.18 --> 2632.72]  Can you help me teach everybody here what we do up here?
[2633.38 --> 2633.60]  Yeah?
[2633.90 --> 2634.46]  Can we do it?
[2634.88 --> 2638.20]  So we're going to teach everybody how we do the children's blessing here today, okay?
[2638.84 --> 2639.08]  Yeah?
[2639.24 --> 2639.78]  Does that work?
[2640.42 --> 2642.26]  So stand up with me
[2642.26 --> 2644.24]  And we'll turn and we're going to teach them, okay?
[2644.24 --> 2645.30]  We're going to show everyone first
[2645.30 --> 2646.26]  And then we're going to ask them
[2646.26 --> 2647.10]  After we show them
[2647.10 --> 2648.70]  We're going to ask them to stand
[2648.70 --> 2650.30]  And then they're going to do it with us, okay?
[2650.38 --> 2651.60]  So what we do up here
[2651.60 --> 2652.18]  What do we do up here?
[2652.20 --> 2653.04]  Where do we put our hands?
[2653.54 --> 2654.64]  We put them up like this, right?
[2655.28 --> 2656.30]  And then we say
[2656.30 --> 2657.64]  What do we say together?
[2657.70 --> 2658.08]  Do you remember?
[2658.08 --> 2660.12]  That's right, we say
[2660.12 --> 2660.40]  We say
[2660.40 --> 2662.78]  The Lord be with you, right?
[2663.30 --> 2663.58]  And so
[2663.58 --> 2665.28]  And then they will respond by saying
[2665.28 --> 2666.50]  And also with you
[2666.50 --> 2667.32]  All right?
[2667.36 --> 2668.20]  So I'm going to invite
[2668.20 --> 2669.02]  Reactivate
[2669.02 --> 2670.72]  And the entire church is going to stand
[2670.72 --> 2673.16]  And then we're going to say
[2673.16 --> 2676.34]  In our loudest, loudest voices together
[2676.34 --> 2677.08]  Are you ready, kids?
[2677.52 --> 2679.40]  One, two, three
[2679.40 --> 2682.22]  The Lord be with you
[2682.22 --> 2684.66]  And also with you
[2684.66 --> 2685.94]  All right, you guys can head to
[2685.94 --> 2686.90]  Children's worship time
[2686.90 --> 2688.24]  If you are a little older
[2688.24 --> 2689.22]  Than kindergarten age
[2689.22 --> 2689.92]  Everybody can have a seat
[2689.92 --> 2690.78]  If you're a little older
[2690.78 --> 2691.66]  Than kindergarten age
[2691.66 --> 2693.72]  There's some clipboards in the back
[2693.72 --> 2695.12]  At the booth there in the back
[2695.12 --> 2695.64]  So if you want to do
[2695.64 --> 2696.32]  A little bit of coloring
[2696.32 --> 2698.10]  While we hear a message today
[2698.10 --> 2698.74]  You can go do that
[2698.74 --> 2700.08]  Just go grab those in the back
[2700.08 --> 2709.24]  One of the things that I love
[2709.24 --> 2710.14]  About the church
[2710.14 --> 2712.08]  Is that no matter where you are from
[2712.08 --> 2713.38]  No matter what age you are
[2713.38 --> 2716.78]  We come together as one family of God
[2716.78 --> 2718.26]  It's the blood of Christ
[2718.26 --> 2719.72]  That binds us together
[2719.72 --> 2721.42]  And so when we gather
[2721.42 --> 2722.46]  Even in this way
[2722.46 --> 2724.44]  With people from all different parts
[2724.44 --> 2725.54]  Of our province
[2725.54 --> 2727.38]  And people of all different ages
[2727.38 --> 2728.70]  And backgrounds
[2728.70 --> 2731.30]  We come together in the presence of God
[2731.30 --> 2732.90]  And we praise His name
[2732.90 --> 2736.64]  We come together also to pray to our God
[2736.64 --> 2738.54]  And so we're going to spend a moment
[2738.54 --> 2739.54]  In prayer together
[2739.54 --> 2741.08]  We're going to lift up
[2741.08 --> 2742.74]  A couple particular needs
[2742.74 --> 2744.86]  From our church family here
[2744.86 --> 2745.98]  And so I'm going to invite you
[2745.98 --> 2746.68]  If you're visiting
[2746.68 --> 2748.30]  Just to hold out your heart
[2748.30 --> 2748.78]  In prayer
[2748.78 --> 2750.92]  As we pray for those people
[2750.92 --> 2752.70]  For the Emmanuel people
[2752.70 --> 2754.78]  In addition to what you saw
[2754.78 --> 2757.48]  In our e-bulletins that went out
[2757.48 --> 2759.02]  Just wanted to note
[2759.02 --> 2760.32]  We found out this morning
[2760.32 --> 2761.20]  That Ellen White
[2761.20 --> 2762.76]  Is back in the hospital
[2762.76 --> 2764.92]  She didn't have a fall
[2764.92 --> 2767.20]  But she was experiencing pain
[2767.20 --> 2768.58]  And severe headaches
[2768.58 --> 2771.56]  And was unsure as to the cause of that
[2771.56 --> 2772.94]  So she's back in the hospital
[2772.94 --> 2774.78]  We hope to find out more details
[2774.78 --> 2776.20]  Later today as well
[2776.20 --> 2777.52]  But we're going to mention her
[2777.52 --> 2778.94]  In our prayers together
[2778.94 --> 2780.90]  Also
[2780.90 --> 2783.30]  Just a note
[2783.30 --> 2784.98]  Next week Saturday
[2784.98 --> 2788.46]  A bunch of council leaders
[2788.46 --> 2790.70]  From different Christian Reformed churches
[2790.70 --> 2791.88]  Are getting together
[2791.88 --> 2793.64]  For a leadership training event
[2793.64 --> 2796.54]  So there's over 140 different leaders
[2796.54 --> 2797.98]  From different CRC churches
[2797.98 --> 2799.88]  In the lower mainland here
[2799.88 --> 2801.70]  Who are coming together
[2801.70 --> 2802.70]  For leadership training
[2802.70 --> 2804.06]  And that's going to happen on Saturday
[2804.06 --> 2805.70]  And so we cover your prayers
[2805.70 --> 2806.42]  For that day
[2806.42 --> 2807.90]  As those leaders come together
[2807.90 --> 2809.40]  And are equipped
[2809.40 --> 2811.28]  For their service among us
[2811.28 --> 2813.10]  Would you join your heart with mine
[2813.10 --> 2813.84]  In prayer
[2813.84 --> 2820.28]  Holy God
[2820.28 --> 2821.94]  We gather here
[2821.94 --> 2824.16]  Because you have not only
[2824.16 --> 2825.66]  Called us to this place
[2825.66 --> 2827.34]  But by the power of your spirit
[2827.34 --> 2829.32]  You have carried us here
[2829.32 --> 2833.14]  You have ordained this moment
[2833.14 --> 2835.60]  That we might be in this place
[2835.60 --> 2836.68]  Worshipping you
[2836.68 --> 2839.08]  And offering you our prayers
[2839.08 --> 2842.42]  Precisely because
[2842.42 --> 2844.04]  You are sovereign God
[2844.04 --> 2845.18]  Precisely because
[2845.18 --> 2847.04]  Of who you are
[2847.04 --> 2848.26]  Precisely because
[2848.26 --> 2850.10]  Your providential hand
[2850.10 --> 2851.34]  Guides and moves
[2851.34 --> 2852.82]  Through this place
[2852.82 --> 2854.34]  Through this city
[2854.34 --> 2855.70]  Through this world
[2855.70 --> 2857.68]  Through each of our hearts
[2857.68 --> 2859.14]  We come to you
[2859.14 --> 2861.46]  With the cries of our hearts
[2861.46 --> 2862.28]  We come to you
[2862.28 --> 2864.46]  With the longings of our souls
[2864.46 --> 2865.66]  We come to you
[2865.66 --> 2866.66]  Lord Jesus
[2866.66 --> 2869.24]  Because you first came to us
[2869.24 --> 2873.40]  And so hear our prayers
[2873.40 --> 2876.70]  Father God
[2876.70 --> 2878.56]  As we gather here in worship
[2878.56 --> 2880.10]  We are so grateful
[2880.10 --> 2881.76]  For Reactivate
[2881.76 --> 2883.24]  And for all of these youth
[2883.24 --> 2884.02]  And their leaders
[2884.02 --> 2886.12]  Who are here with us
[2886.12 --> 2887.80]  And we just pray
[2887.80 --> 2888.20]  Lord
[2888.20 --> 2889.50]  That the gospel
[2889.50 --> 2890.32]  That they heard
[2890.32 --> 2891.64]  Proclaimed this week
[2891.64 --> 2893.82]  Would plant itself
[2893.82 --> 2895.68]  Deep in their hearts
[2895.68 --> 2897.58]  That the Jesus
[2897.58 --> 2898.56]  That they saw
[2898.56 --> 2899.42]  Or perhaps even
[2899.42 --> 2900.42]  Were introduced to
[2900.42 --> 2901.50]  For the first time
[2901.50 --> 2902.90]  Would be made more
[2902.90 --> 2903.80]  And more real
[2903.80 --> 2904.62]  In their lives
[2904.62 --> 2908.26]  Captivate their hearts
[2908.26 --> 2909.28]  With your love
[2909.28 --> 2912.64]  Compel them
[2912.64 --> 2913.82]  In relationship to you
[2913.82 --> 2914.70]  By your beauty
[2914.70 --> 2915.42]  And the beauty
[2915.42 --> 2916.52]  Of your gospel
[2916.52 --> 2919.60]  And as each one
[2919.60 --> 2920.64]  Goes today
[2920.64 --> 2921.86]  From this weekend
[2921.86 --> 2923.80]  We pray Lord God
[2923.80 --> 2924.52]  That the faith
[2924.52 --> 2925.80]  Grown in them
[2925.80 --> 2926.66]  Would blossom
[2926.66 --> 2928.02]  And bear fruit
[2928.02 --> 2928.78]  In the harvest
[2928.78 --> 2929.76]  Thirty, sixty
[2929.76 --> 2930.94]  And one hundred fold
[2930.94 --> 2935.22]  God we pray
[2935.22 --> 2936.38]  That as they go
[2936.38 --> 2937.46]  From this place
[2937.46 --> 2939.40]  Impacted
[2939.40 --> 2941.04]  By encountering you
[2941.04 --> 2941.78]  This weekend
[2941.78 --> 2943.50]  That they would know
[2943.50 --> 2944.74]  Your kingdom come
[2944.74 --> 2945.82]  And your kingdom coming
[2945.82 --> 2947.00]  And they would reveal it
[2947.00 --> 2947.94]  To the world
[2947.94 --> 2951.48]  Use them Lord God
[2951.48 --> 2953.00]  To light a fire
[2953.00 --> 2954.52]  And to start a revival
[2954.52 --> 2955.68]  In our midst
[2955.68 --> 2958.64]  Bless them we pray
[2958.64 --> 2959.60]  In Jesus name
[2959.60 --> 2963.78]  Father as we gather
[2963.78 --> 2964.98]  We gather as those
[2964.98 --> 2966.20]  Who are crying out
[2966.20 --> 2966.72]  For healing
[2966.72 --> 2968.24]  We gather as those
[2968.24 --> 2969.56]  Who are crying out
[2969.56 --> 2970.42]  For restoration
[2970.42 --> 2971.42]  In relationships
[2971.42 --> 2973.18]  We gather as those
[2973.18 --> 2974.34]  Who are celebrating
[2974.34 --> 2975.26]  Your goodness
[2975.26 --> 2976.14]  And we gather
[2976.14 --> 2976.90]  As those
[2976.90 --> 2977.42]  Lord God
[2977.42 --> 2978.82]  Who have experienced
[2978.82 --> 2979.58]  Your blessing
[2979.58 --> 2980.82]  In a special way
[2980.82 --> 2981.66]  This week
[2981.66 --> 2984.28]  One of the beauties
[2984.28 --> 2985.46]  Of the body of Christ
[2985.46 --> 2986.40]  Is that we mourn
[2986.40 --> 2987.48]  With those who mourn
[2987.48 --> 2988.22]  And we rejoice
[2988.22 --> 2990.02]  With those who rejoice
[2990.02 --> 2992.20]  And so Lord God
[2992.20 --> 2993.26]  We enter into
[2993.26 --> 2994.16]  The lives
[2994.16 --> 2994.82]  Of those
[2994.82 --> 2995.58]  Who are mourning
[2995.58 --> 2996.48]  This week
[2996.48 --> 2998.48]  We remember
[2998.48 --> 2998.50]  We remember
[2998.50 --> 2999.72]  Wendy Badge
[2999.72 --> 3001.12]  Who was a member
[3001.12 --> 3002.56]  Here for some time
[3002.56 --> 3003.92]  And who reached out
[3003.92 --> 3004.34]  This week
[3004.34 --> 3005.32]  To let us know
[3005.32 --> 3006.44]  That her daughter
[3006.44 --> 3007.82]  Just 55 years old
[3007.82 --> 3008.58]  Passed away
[3008.58 --> 3010.12]  After a sudden aneurysm
[3010.12 --> 3011.74]  And so we pray
[3011.74 --> 3012.24]  Lord God
[3012.24 --> 3013.84]  Speak your love
[3013.84 --> 3014.58]  And peace
[3014.58 --> 3016.02]  To Wendy's heart
[3016.02 --> 3017.64]  Help her to know
[3017.64 --> 3018.80]  Your nearness
[3018.80 --> 3021.72]  Father God
[3021.72 --> 3022.72]  We pray for those
[3022.72 --> 3024.38]  Who are crying out
[3024.38 --> 3025.36]  In health concerns
[3025.36 --> 3027.38]  Who need your presence
[3027.38 --> 3029.42]  Who need your healing hand
[3029.42 --> 3030.04]  Upon them
[3030.04 --> 3032.48]  God you promise
[3032.48 --> 3033.18]  In your word
[3033.18 --> 3033.88]  That the prayer
[3033.88 --> 3034.86]  Offered in faith
[3034.86 --> 3036.06]  Will make the sick person
[3036.06 --> 3037.76]  Well and so we pray
[3037.76 --> 3039.10]  Bring healing
[3039.10 --> 3041.02]  We pray
[3041.02 --> 3042.16]  Bring peace
[3042.16 --> 3043.70]  And comfort
[3043.70 --> 3045.68]  We pray that you
[3045.68 --> 3046.34]  Would be near to
[3046.34 --> 3046.94]  Rose Vita
[3046.94 --> 3047.70]  And all of her
[3047.70 --> 3048.62]  Health concerns
[3048.62 --> 3050.18]  We pray that you
[3050.18 --> 3050.64]  Would give her
[3050.64 --> 3051.38]  What she needs
[3051.38 --> 3052.48]  And surround her
[3052.48 --> 3053.54]  With your love
[3053.54 --> 3054.76]  Surround her
[3054.76 --> 3055.56]  With the body
[3055.56 --> 3056.12]  Of Christ
[3056.12 --> 3056.96]  That she might know
[3056.96 --> 3058.78]  She is not alone
[3058.78 --> 3059.76]  That she might know
[3059.76 --> 3061.42]  That you are with her
[3061.42 --> 3062.38]  That you will never
[3062.38 --> 3063.06]  Leave her
[3063.06 --> 3064.14]  Nor forsake her
[3064.14 --> 3065.18]  That she might know
[3065.18 --> 3066.52]  That through the presence
[3066.52 --> 3067.60]  Of your church
[3067.60 --> 3069.08]  As we surround her
[3069.08 --> 3070.06]  In this time
[3070.06 --> 3072.96]  God we pray
[3072.96 --> 3073.66]  Much the same
[3073.66 --> 3074.12]  For Ellen
[3074.12 --> 3075.60]  We don't know
[3075.60 --> 3076.20]  What it is
[3076.20 --> 3077.26]  That has caused
[3077.26 --> 3078.28]  This visit
[3078.28 --> 3079.06]  To the hospital
[3079.06 --> 3079.86]  And we pray
[3079.86 --> 3081.04]  That you would
[3081.04 --> 3082.24]  Use the hands
[3082.24 --> 3082.86]  Of the doctors
[3082.86 --> 3083.52]  And the nurses
[3083.52 --> 3084.90]  To figure that out
[3084.90 --> 3085.64]  And to provide
[3085.64 --> 3086.72]  A measure of healing
[3086.72 --> 3088.48]  We pray God
[3088.48 --> 3089.10]  That if they are
[3089.10 --> 3090.50]  Unable to figure it out
[3090.50 --> 3091.08]  That still
[3091.08 --> 3091.98]  Miraculously
[3091.98 --> 3092.94]  You would provide
[3092.94 --> 3093.92]  A measure of healing
[3093.92 --> 3094.70]  For her
[3094.70 --> 3096.74]  And in the midst
[3096.74 --> 3097.14]  Of this
[3097.14 --> 3097.84]  God we pray
[3097.84 --> 3099.00]  To for her
[3099.00 --> 3099.68]  Heart
[3099.68 --> 3100.86]  And for her
[3100.86 --> 3102.02]  Sense of peace
[3102.02 --> 3103.04]  Even as she
[3103.04 --> 3104.60]  Lives in the midst
[3104.60 --> 3105.50]  Of this unknown
[3105.50 --> 3109.02]  God we want to pray
[3109.02 --> 3109.92]  As well for
[3109.92 --> 3111.92]  Amanda's mom
[3111.92 --> 3112.58]  As she too
[3112.58 --> 3113.94]  Is in the hospital
[3113.94 --> 3114.74]  And we're not sure
[3114.74 --> 3115.82]  What the future is
[3115.82 --> 3116.36]  For her
[3116.36 --> 3118.02]  We pray that you
[3118.02 --> 3119.72]  Would give her
[3119.72 --> 3120.98]  A sense of peace
[3120.98 --> 3121.66]  That you would
[3121.66 --> 3123.04]  Give the whole family
[3123.04 --> 3123.98]  A sense of comfort
[3123.98 --> 3124.40]  And for
[3124.40 --> 3125.56]  Kloss too
[3125.56 --> 3126.04]  As he
[3126.04 --> 3128.54]  Is back in Abbotsford
[3128.54 --> 3129.22]  To be near
[3129.22 --> 3129.98]  And as he
[3129.98 --> 3131.00]  Also wrestles
[3131.00 --> 3132.02]  With this time
[3132.02 --> 3132.90]  In their life
[3132.90 --> 3133.44]  And marriage
[3133.44 --> 3133.82]  Together
[3133.82 --> 3135.94]  Give them
[3135.94 --> 3136.64]  What they need
[3136.64 --> 3137.86]  And support
[3137.86 --> 3138.82]  The family
[3138.82 --> 3139.60]  As they also
[3139.60 --> 3140.28]  Come around
[3140.28 --> 3142.10]  And draw near
[3142.10 --> 3142.52]  To mom
[3142.52 --> 3144.56]  Give them all
[3144.56 --> 3147.32]  Your unimaginable
[3147.32 --> 3148.56]  And immeasurable
[3148.56 --> 3149.02]  Peace
[3149.02 --> 3151.86]  God we pray too
[3151.86 --> 3152.62]  For Amy
[3152.62 --> 3153.24]  That you would
[3153.24 --> 3153.70]  Continue
[3153.70 --> 3155.94]  To be near
[3155.94 --> 3156.34]  To her
[3156.34 --> 3156.98]  Even as she
[3156.98 --> 3157.90]  Receives treatment
[3157.90 --> 3159.92]  Give her
[3159.92 --> 3160.60]  All that she
[3160.60 --> 3161.00]  Needs
[3161.00 --> 3161.70]  And give her
[3161.70 --> 3162.20]  Strength
[3162.20 --> 3162.86]  Lord God
[3162.86 --> 3163.46]  To endure
[3163.46 --> 3164.20]  This moment
[3164.20 --> 3166.34]  And we pray
[3166.34 --> 3167.64]  Similarly for
[3167.64 --> 3167.98]  Anne
[3167.98 --> 3168.86]  As she has
[3168.86 --> 3170.42]  Injured her back
[3170.42 --> 3170.90]  Give her
[3170.90 --> 3171.78]  What she needs
[3171.78 --> 3172.92]  And help her
[3172.92 --> 3173.48]  Lord God
[3173.48 --> 3174.06]  To recover
[3174.06 --> 3174.56]  Well
[3174.56 --> 3175.98]  And to return
[3175.98 --> 3176.94]  To her life
[3176.94 --> 3178.22]  As ordinary
[3178.22 --> 3180.02]  We pray that
[3180.02 --> 3181.38]  For all of those
[3181.38 --> 3183.16]  Who are experiencing
[3183.16 --> 3184.16]  Emotional
[3184.16 --> 3186.22]  Or mental
[3186.22 --> 3187.12]  Struggles
[3187.12 --> 3187.86]  And difficulties
[3187.86 --> 3188.54]  As well
[3188.54 --> 3189.10]  Lord God
[3189.10 --> 3190.90]  The pain
[3190.90 --> 3191.68]  And anxiety
[3191.68 --> 3192.82]  Of these moments
[3192.82 --> 3193.98]  Can seem
[3193.98 --> 3194.80]  Unfathomable
[3194.80 --> 3196.28]  And can be so hard
[3196.28 --> 3196.94]  To communicate
[3196.94 --> 3198.16]  To those around us
[3198.16 --> 3198.52]  And so
[3198.52 --> 3199.80]  For those in the midst
[3199.80 --> 3200.50]  Of the dark night
[3200.50 --> 3201.04]  Of the soul
[3201.04 --> 3202.22]  For those in the midst
[3202.22 --> 3204.50]  Of feeling
[3204.50 --> 3205.68]  Overwhelmed
[3205.68 --> 3206.38]  By life
[3206.38 --> 3207.18]  And circumstance
[3207.18 --> 3208.24]  We pray
[3208.24 --> 3208.90]  That you would
[3208.90 --> 3209.96]  Not only
[3209.96 --> 3211.76]  Buoy them up
[3211.76 --> 3212.56]  And hold them
[3212.56 --> 3213.16]  In the palm
[3213.16 --> 3213.76]  Of your hand
[3213.76 --> 3214.50]  But that you would
[3214.50 --> 3215.44]  Surround them
[3215.44 --> 3216.20]  With the right
[3216.20 --> 3216.88]  Person
[3216.88 --> 3217.96]  Or people
[3217.96 --> 3219.76]  To encourage them
[3219.76 --> 3220.42]  In this time
[3220.42 --> 3224.68]  Heavenly Father
[3224.68 --> 3227.92]  We thank you
[3227.92 --> 3229.64]  For your amazing
[3229.64 --> 3231.12]  Presence among us
[3231.12 --> 3232.76]  And we especially
[3232.76 --> 3233.98]  Give you thanks
[3233.98 --> 3235.50]  For the volunteers
[3235.50 --> 3236.58]  Who have made
[3236.58 --> 3237.38]  This weekend
[3237.38 --> 3237.96]  Possible
[3237.96 --> 3239.76]  We praise your name
[3239.76 --> 3241.02]  For faithful servants
[3241.02 --> 3241.68]  Of the church
[3241.68 --> 3243.32]  Who see this need
[3243.32 --> 3244.62]  And who see this priority
[3244.62 --> 3245.74]  And who come alongside
[3245.74 --> 3247.36]  And who make that happen
[3247.36 --> 3248.88]  And God
[3248.88 --> 3249.94]  We give you praise
[3249.94 --> 3250.84]  For them
[3250.84 --> 3252.50]  For those who have
[3252.50 --> 3254.40]  Served quietly
[3254.40 --> 3256.00]  And behind the scenes
[3256.00 --> 3257.20]  We give you praise
[3257.20 --> 3258.16]  For them
[3258.16 --> 3259.22]  For those who have
[3259.22 --> 3260.52]  Carried tables
[3260.52 --> 3261.64]  And cleaned tables
[3261.64 --> 3263.08]  We give you praise
[3263.08 --> 3263.68]  For them
[3263.68 --> 3264.46]  For those who have
[3264.46 --> 3265.32]  Prepared food
[3265.32 --> 3266.24]  Who have looked
[3266.24 --> 3266.94]  After parking
[3266.94 --> 3267.90]  Who have been
[3267.90 --> 3269.22]  In so many different places
[3269.22 --> 3270.08]  Have cleaned more
[3270.08 --> 3270.96]  Bathrooms than they
[3270.96 --> 3271.66]  Care to admit
[3271.66 --> 3273.00]  We give you praise
[3273.00 --> 3273.94]  For them
[3273.94 --> 3276.04]  And we thank you
[3276.04 --> 3276.44]  Lord God
[3276.44 --> 3277.28]  For this chance
[3277.28 --> 3278.30]  To be together
[3278.30 --> 3279.90]  As your church
[3279.90 --> 3282.12]  We pray this
[3282.12 --> 3282.70]  In the name
[3282.70 --> 3283.74]  Of Jesus Christ
[3283.74 --> 3284.90]  Our Lord and Savior
[3284.90 --> 3286.08]  Amen
[3286.08 --> 3288.98]  I'm going to invite
[3288.98 --> 3289.88]  Curtis to come up
[3289.88 --> 3291.04]  And he's going to
[3291.04 --> 3292.66]  Invite Tim to come up
[3292.66 --> 3294.48]  And introduce him to us
[3294.48 --> 3295.50]  For the third time
[3295.50 --> 3300.28]  So our theme
[3300.28 --> 3300.74]  This weekend
[3300.74 --> 3301.40]  As you can see
[3301.40 --> 3302.70]  Is proclaim his salvation
[3302.70 --> 3303.70]  Day after day
[3303.70 --> 3304.98]  And we chose that theme
[3304.98 --> 3305.88]  Specifically because
[3305.88 --> 3307.52]  We wanted Tim and Charity
[3307.52 --> 3308.26]  To be our speakers
[3308.26 --> 3308.72]  This weekend
[3308.72 --> 3309.80]  Because they're involved
[3309.80 --> 3310.74]  In that work
[3310.74 --> 3312.40]  Day in and day out
[3312.40 --> 3313.18]  So it's kind of
[3313.18 --> 3314.06]  A two-fold thing
[3314.06 --> 3315.16]  They do this in their work
[3315.16 --> 3315.88]  And then they come here
[3315.88 --> 3317.06]  And they proclaim it to us
[3317.06 --> 3318.02]  Day after day
[3318.02 --> 3318.74]  Friday, Saturday
[3318.74 --> 3319.56]  And Sunday
[3319.56 --> 3320.64]  So I want to offer
[3320.64 --> 3322.14]  A prayer of illumination
[3322.14 --> 3323.94]  This is for two reasons
[3323.94 --> 3324.58]  One for us
[3324.58 --> 3325.38]  To prepare ourselves
[3325.38 --> 3326.22]  To hear the word
[3326.22 --> 3327.54]  Of God from Tim
[3327.54 --> 3329.08]  And also to pray over Tim
[3329.08 --> 3329.92]  As he is anointed
[3329.92 --> 3331.60]  To give the word to us
[3331.60 --> 3332.68]  So let me pray
[3332.68 --> 3335.34]  Father God in heaven
[3335.34 --> 3336.80]  You know where we come from
[3336.80 --> 3338.02]  And you know who we are
[3338.02 --> 3339.44]  And you have brought us here
[3339.44 --> 3340.24]  So I pray Lord
[3340.24 --> 3341.46]  That you would open our hearts
[3341.46 --> 3342.20]  And our minds
[3342.20 --> 3343.74]  To receive the words
[3343.74 --> 3344.72]  That you have prepared
[3344.72 --> 3345.94]  On Tim's heart
[3345.94 --> 3347.88]  Lord work in him
[3347.88 --> 3349.22]  To speak your truth
[3349.22 --> 3350.16]  And to speak the word
[3350.16 --> 3350.76]  To us
[3350.76 --> 3352.26]  And Lord we want to give you
[3352.26 --> 3353.88]  All the glory and praise
[3353.88 --> 3354.70]  For your revelation
[3354.70 --> 3355.48]  To us today
[3355.48 --> 3356.76]  In your name we pray
[3356.76 --> 3357.36]  Amen
[3357.36 --> 3362.80]  Good morning again
[3362.80 --> 3364.74]  So one of the
[3364.74 --> 3366.02]  The key main verse
[3366.02 --> 3367.16]  For this weekend
[3367.16 --> 3368.92]  Was 1 Chronicles 16
[3368.92 --> 3370.36]  23 and 24
[3370.36 --> 3371.90]  Which says
[3371.90 --> 3372.88]  Sing to the Lord
[3372.88 --> 3373.78]  All the earth
[3373.78 --> 3375.34]  Proclaim his salvation
[3375.34 --> 3376.66]  Day after day
[3376.66 --> 3378.26]  Declare his glory
[3378.26 --> 3379.78]  Among the nations
[3379.78 --> 3381.04]  His marvelous deeds
[3381.04 --> 3382.00]  Among the people
[3382.00 --> 3384.44]  One of the big things
[3384.44 --> 3385.24]  That we can do that
[3385.24 --> 3386.28]  Through is
[3386.28 --> 3387.34]  Through our testimony
[3387.34 --> 3389.16]  Through our stories
[3389.16 --> 3389.74]  And that's kind of
[3389.74 --> 3390.24]  The cool thing
[3390.24 --> 3391.14]  So this weekend
[3391.14 --> 3392.08]  We kind of touched on
[3392.08 --> 3392.66]  Friday night
[3392.66 --> 3393.52]  We were touching on
[3393.52 --> 3395.46]  Getting to know this
[3395.46 --> 3396.82]  Getting to know your bible
[3396.82 --> 3399.12]  Getting to know God's word
[3399.12 --> 3399.80]  Getting to be able
[3399.80 --> 3400.96]  To hear his voice
[3400.96 --> 3402.68]  And understand his voice
[3402.68 --> 3404.66]  Also spending time in prayer
[3404.66 --> 3406.58]  Which then you also
[3406.58 --> 3407.62]  Be able to get to know
[3407.62 --> 3408.26]  God's voice
[3408.26 --> 3409.28]  And be able to see
[3409.28 --> 3410.06]  Where he's leading
[3410.06 --> 3410.88]  Where he's guiding
[3410.88 --> 3412.44]  If he's opening up doors
[3412.44 --> 3413.64]  And if he's telling you
[3413.64 --> 3414.90]  Hey I need you to
[3414.90 --> 3415.88]  Talk to so and so
[3415.88 --> 3416.72]  Hey I need you to
[3416.72 --> 3417.66]  Speak to so and so
[3417.66 --> 3420.86]  And the cool thing is
[3420.86 --> 3422.50]  And so what we really did
[3422.50 --> 3424.62]  Is we encouraged everybody
[3424.62 --> 3427.34]  To share where they are
[3427.34 --> 3428.86]  Because we can't be
[3428.86 --> 3430.36]  Where everybody else is
[3430.36 --> 3431.18]  We don't know
[3431.18 --> 3431.98]  All the people
[3431.98 --> 3433.30]  That everybody else does
[3433.30 --> 3434.44]  You guys are related
[3434.44 --> 3435.40]  To people that we
[3435.40 --> 3436.52]  That I probably
[3436.52 --> 3437.50]  Will never talk to
[3437.50 --> 3439.74]  Just because of proximity
[3439.74 --> 3441.54]  Or you know people
[3441.54 --> 3442.72]  Or you're friends with people
[3442.72 --> 3444.10]  And so you have that
[3444.10 --> 3445.08]  Relationship and you
[3445.08 --> 3446.10]  Have that built in
[3446.10 --> 3448.70]  And so what we're
[3448.70 --> 3450.40]  Encouraging is
[3450.40 --> 3451.94]  Be missional
[3451.94 --> 3453.40]  Wherever God has
[3453.40 --> 3454.24]  Planted you
[3454.24 --> 3454.74]  Bloom
[3454.74 --> 3456.16]  And so
[3456.16 --> 3458.04]  Be God's light
[3458.04 --> 3459.26]  In those different areas
[3459.26 --> 3460.70]  And then it was neat
[3460.70 --> 3461.34]  Last night
[3461.34 --> 3462.76]  Charity was able to
[3462.76 --> 3463.64]  Share her testimony
[3463.64 --> 3464.68]  As well
[3464.68 --> 3465.82]  And encourage the kids
[3465.82 --> 3467.60]  As well to be able to
[3467.60 --> 3469.40]  Proclaim the gospel
[3469.40 --> 3471.48]  And she gave examples
[3471.48 --> 3472.84]  Of how God
[3472.84 --> 3475.02]  Had used other people
[3475.02 --> 3475.80]  In the past
[3475.80 --> 3476.98]  To be able to
[3476.98 --> 3477.94]  Share the gospel
[3477.94 --> 3478.46]  With her
[3478.46 --> 3479.98]  And had reached out
[3479.98 --> 3480.40]  To her
[3480.40 --> 3481.06]  And had
[3481.06 --> 3483.44]  Illuminated her life
[3483.44 --> 3484.76]  With his
[3484.76 --> 3485.52]  Truth
[3485.52 --> 3488.34]  This morning
[3488.34 --> 3489.88]  I'm going to dig into
[3489.88 --> 3492.14]  A bit of
[3492.14 --> 3493.32]  Acts
[3493.32 --> 3494.00]  We're going to
[3494.00 --> 3494.42]  We're going to
[3494.42 --> 3494.88]  Check out
[3494.88 --> 3495.40]  Acts
[3495.40 --> 3496.82]  Chapter 2
[3496.82 --> 3498.38]  Verses 37
[3498.38 --> 3499.52]  Through 47
[3499.52 --> 3500.80]  So if you guys
[3500.80 --> 3501.70]  Have your Bibles
[3501.70 --> 3502.36]  Pull them out
[3502.36 --> 3503.28]  And open up
[3503.28 --> 3504.58]  To that passage
[3504.58 --> 3506.22]  One of the cool
[3506.22 --> 3506.92]  Things was
[3506.92 --> 3507.72]  Is when I saw
[3507.72 --> 3508.48]  That it was
[3508.48 --> 3509.64]  About declaring
[3509.64 --> 3510.60]  Or proclaiming
[3510.60 --> 3511.32]  His salvation
[3511.32 --> 3512.18]  Day after day
[3512.18 --> 3513.04]  Right away
[3513.04 --> 3513.84]  I started thinking
[3513.84 --> 3514.74]  Of the early church
[3514.74 --> 3515.40]  I'm like
[3515.40 --> 3516.14]  How do we get
[3516.14 --> 3516.96]  To be to where
[3516.96 --> 3517.78]  The early church
[3517.78 --> 3518.20]  Was
[3518.20 --> 3519.96]  When they just
[3519.96 --> 3520.54]  Got to
[3520.54 --> 3521.96]  When they just
[3521.96 --> 3522.90]  Started proclaiming
[3522.90 --> 3524.08]  The gospel
[3524.08 --> 3525.80]  And the cool
[3525.80 --> 3526.56]  Thing was
[3526.56 --> 3528.72]  It's kind of
[3528.72 --> 3529.24]  Interesting
[3529.24 --> 3530.04]  If you start
[3530.04 --> 3530.58]  Looking in the
[3530.58 --> 3531.26]  Book of Acts
[3531.26 --> 3532.56]  Peter just keeps
[3532.56 --> 3533.20]  Going on
[3533.20 --> 3533.72]  And he's like
[3533.72 --> 3533.94]  Hey
[3533.94 --> 3534.50]  You guys
[3534.50 --> 3535.04]  Remember that
[3535.04 --> 3535.46]  Jesus
[3535.46 --> 3536.60]  Remember Jesus
[3536.60 --> 3537.36]  That came here
[3537.36 --> 3537.86]  You know
[3537.86 --> 3538.40]  The guy that
[3538.40 --> 3538.92]  You killed
[3538.92 --> 3539.66]  And crucified
[3539.66 --> 3540.68]  You know
[3540.68 --> 3541.10]  The one that
[3541.10 --> 3541.66]  God sent
[3541.66 --> 3542.18]  He was the
[3542.18 --> 3542.64]  Messiah
[3542.64 --> 3543.86]  And so
[3543.86 --> 3544.36]  He actually
[3544.36 --> 3545.02]  Goes around
[3545.02 --> 3545.54]  And he just
[3545.54 --> 3546.86]  Boldly proclaims
[3546.86 --> 3547.02]  It
[3547.02 --> 3548.34]  And so
[3548.34 --> 3549.00]  It's
[3549.00 --> 3549.54]  And so
[3549.54 --> 3550.04]  We're jumping
[3550.04 --> 3550.56]  Right into
[3550.56 --> 3551.46]  The middle
[3551.46 --> 3551.90]  Of the
[3551.90 --> 3552.66]  Chapter
[3552.66 --> 3554.22]  But where
[3554.22 --> 3555.06]  He's talking
[3555.06 --> 3555.56]  About these
[3555.56 --> 3555.90]  Things
[3555.90 --> 3557.52]  Actually
[3557.52 --> 3557.76]  I'm going
[3557.76 --> 3559.54]  To read
[3559.54 --> 3562.58]  Yeah
[3562.58 --> 3562.86]  I'm going
[3562.86 --> 3563.24]  To read
[3563.24 --> 3563.96]  Chapter
[3563.96 --> 3564.82]  Or verse
[3564.82 --> 3565.90]  36 as well
[3565.90 --> 3568.16]  But yeah
[3568.16 --> 3568.66]  So let's
[3568.66 --> 3569.08]  Start here
[3569.08 --> 3570.26]  So let
[3570.26 --> 3570.98]  Everyone in
[3570.98 --> 3571.68]  Israel know
[3571.68 --> 3572.34]  For certain
[3572.34 --> 3573.74]  That God
[3573.74 --> 3574.34]  Has made
[3574.34 --> 3575.04]  This Jesus
[3575.04 --> 3575.62]  Whom you
[3575.62 --> 3576.36]  Crucified
[3576.36 --> 3577.08]  To be both
[3577.08 --> 3577.88]  Lord and
[3577.88 --> 3578.34]  Messiah
[3578.34 --> 3579.46]  Peter's
[3579.46 --> 3579.82]  Words
[3579.82 --> 3580.34]  Pierced
[3580.34 --> 3580.86]  The hearts
[3580.86 --> 3581.84]  And they
[3581.84 --> 3582.64]  Said to him
[3582.64 --> 3583.72]  And to the
[3583.72 --> 3584.44]  Other disciples
[3584.44 --> 3585.52]  Brothers
[3585.52 --> 3586.04]  What should
[3586.04 --> 3586.50]  We do
[3586.50 --> 3587.84]  Peter replied
[3587.84 --> 3588.42]  Each of you
[3588.42 --> 3589.16]  Must repent
[3589.16 --> 3589.94]  Of your sins
[3589.94 --> 3590.58]  And turn
[3590.58 --> 3591.18]  To God
[3591.18 --> 3591.64]  And be
[3591.64 --> 3592.26]  Baptized
[3592.26 --> 3592.72]  In the name
[3592.72 --> 3593.12]  Of Jesus
[3593.12 --> 3593.58]  Christ
[3593.58 --> 3593.94]  For the
[3593.94 --> 3594.40]  Forgiveness
[3594.40 --> 3595.52]  Of your
[3595.52 --> 3596.02]  Sins
[3596.02 --> 3597.26]  Then you
[3597.26 --> 3597.78]  Will receive
[3597.78 --> 3598.28]  The gift
[3598.28 --> 3598.54]  Of the
[3598.54 --> 3599.20]  Holy Spirit
[3599.20 --> 3600.62]  This promise
[3600.62 --> 3601.50]  Is to you
[3601.50 --> 3602.28]  And to your
[3602.28 --> 3602.70]  Children
[3602.70 --> 3603.34]  And even
[3603.34 --> 3603.72]  To the
[3603.72 --> 3604.36]  Gentiles
[3604.36 --> 3606.16]  All who
[3606.16 --> 3606.72]  Have been
[3606.72 --> 3607.18]  Called
[3607.18 --> 3608.02]  By the
[3608.02 --> 3608.32]  Lord
[3608.32 --> 3608.62]  Our
[3608.62 --> 3609.02]  God
[3609.02 --> 3609.90]  Then
[3609.90 --> 3610.22]  Peter
[3610.22 --> 3610.82]  Continued
[3610.82 --> 3611.28]  Preaching
[3611.28 --> 3611.78]  For a
[3611.78 --> 3612.48]  Long time
[3612.48 --> 3614.46]  Strongly
[3614.46 --> 3614.90]  Urging
[3614.90 --> 3615.20]  His
[3615.20 --> 3615.72]  Listeners
[3615.72 --> 3616.14]  Save
[3616.14 --> 3616.62]  Yourself
[3616.62 --> 3617.02]  From this
[3617.02 --> 3617.40]  Crooked
[3617.40 --> 3618.12]  Generation
[3618.12 --> 3620.76]  Those who
[3620.76 --> 3621.28]  Believed
[3621.28 --> 3622.04]  That what
[3622.04 --> 3622.78]  Peter said
[3622.78 --> 3623.76]  Were baptized
[3623.76 --> 3624.54]  And added

[3900.42 --> 3900.62]  That's
[3900.62 --> 3900.82]  Going

[3902.58 --> 3902.78]  Those
[3902.78 --> 3903.10]  Different
[3903.10 --> 3903.56]  Issues
[3903.56 --> 3906.74]  When
[3906.74 --> 3906.88]  We
[3906.88 --> 3907.08]  Look
[3907.08 --> 3907.18]  At
[3907.18 --> 3907.32]  The
[3907.32 --> 3907.84]  Book
[3907.84 --> 3908.02]  Of
[3908.02 --> 3908.46]  Acts
[3908.46 --> 3909.22]  In
[3909.22 --> 3909.70]  Their
[3909.70 --> 3910.14]  Time
[3910.14 --> 3910.72]  They

[3910.84 --> 3911.06]  Living
[3911.06 --> 3911.28]  In
[3911.28 --> 3911.54]  Rome
[3911.54 --> 3912.08]  And
[3912.08 --> 3912.26]  So
[3912.26 --> 3912.66]  Rome
[3912.66 --> 3912.88]  Was
[3912.88 --> 3913.28]  Very
[3913.28 --> 3913.76]  Much
[3913.76 --> 3914.66]  It
[3914.66 --> 3914.82]  Was
[3914.82 --> 3915.02]  Even
[3915.02 --> 3915.42]  Worse
[3915.42 --> 3915.68]  It
[3915.68 --> 3915.84]  Was
[3915.84 --> 3916.02]  Even
[3916.02 --> 3916.36]  Worse
[3916.36 --> 3916.56]  Than
[3916.56 --> 3916.74]  What
[3916.74 --> 3916.88]  We
[3916.88 --> 3917.20]  Have
[3917.20 --> 3917.68]  To
[3917.68 --> 3917.92]  This
[3917.92 --> 3918.20]  Day
[3918.20 --> 3919.42]  And
[3919.42 --> 3919.80]  And
[3919.80 --> 3920.36]  And
[3920.36 --> 3920.56]  It
[3920.56 --> 3920.72]  Was
[3920.72 --> 3921.02]  Cool
[3921.02 --> 3921.22]  To
[3925.78 --> 3926.14]  Lourish
[3926.14 --> 3926.82]  So
[3926.82 --> 3927.28]  Because
[3927.28 --> 3927.50]  We
[3927.50 --> 3927.72]  Have
[3927.72 --> 3927.94]  These
[3927.94 --> 3928.34]  Fires
[3928.34 --> 3928.50]  In
[3928.50 --> 3928.64]  Our
[3928.64 --> 3929.32]  Backyard
[3929.32 --> 3930.26]  I
[3930.26 --> 3930.50]  Actually
[3930.50 --> 3930.68]  Took
[3930.68 --> 3930.80]  A
[3930.80 --> 3931.08]  Picture
[3931.08 --> 3931.32]  On
[3931.32 --> 3931.46]  The
[3931.46 --> 3931.70]  Way
[3931.70 --> 3932.22]  Over
[3932.22 --> 3933.78]  I
[3933.78 --> 3933.96]  Think
[3933.96 --> 3934.10]  It's
[3934.10 --> 3934.26]  Up
[3934.26 --> 3934.42]  There
[3934.42 --> 3934.72]  There
[3934.72 --> 3934.84]  It
[3934.84 --> 3935.02]  Is
[3935.02 --> 3936.10]  There
[3936.10 --> 3936.54]  Is
[3936.54 --> 3936.74]  One
[3936.74 --> 3936.82]  Of
[3936.82 --> 3936.94]  The
[3936.94 --> 3937.38]  Sections
[3937.38 --> 3937.64]  Where
[3937.64 --> 3937.80]  The
[3937.80 --> 3938.28]  Fire
[3938.28 --> 3938.52]  Just
[3938.52 --> 3938.78]  Blew
[3938.78 --> 3939.02]  Through
[3939.02 --> 3939.20]  It
[3939.20 --> 3939.40]  Went
[3939.40 --> 3939.62]  Right
[3939.62 --> 3939.84]  Next
[3939.84 --> 3939.96]  To
[3939.96 --> 3940.06]  The
[3940.06 --> 3940.38]  Highway
[3940.38 --> 3940.74]  And
[3940.74 --> 3941.10]  Jumped
[3941.10 --> 3941.20]  The
[3941.20 --> 3941.50]  Highway
[3941.50 --> 3942.08]  And
[3942.08 --> 3942.42]  Everything
[3942.42 --> 3943.62]  But
[3943.62 --> 3943.82]  One
[3943.82 --> 3943.90]  Of
[3943.90 --> 3944.00]  The
[3944.00 --> 3944.26]  Things
[3944.26 --> 3944.52]  That
[3944.52 --> 3945.20]  What
[3945.20 --> 3945.32]  I
[3945.32 --> 3945.62]  Looked
[3945.62 --> 3945.82]  At
[3945.82 --> 3946.10]  Through
[3946.10 --> 3946.50]  This
[3946.50 --> 3947.32]  Is
[3947.32 --> 3947.72]  We
[3947.72 --> 3947.98]  Live
[3947.98 --> 3948.12]  In
[3948.12 --> 3948.26]  An

[3958.28 --> 3958.58]  Different

[3958.80 --> 3959.72]  But
[3959.72 --> 3961.34]  You
[3961.34 --> 3961.58]  Look
[3961.58 --> 3961.78]  At
[3961.78 --> 3962.08]  The

[3962.84 --> 3963.50]  Okay
[3963.50 --> 3963.76]  So
[3963.76 --> 3963.90]  I

[5159.78 --> 5165.94]  shining in the light of the glory
[5165.94 --> 5172.06]  pour out your power and love
[5172.06 --> 5178.56]  as we sing holy, holy, holy
[5178.56 --> 5185.50]  as we sing holy, holy, holy
[5185.50 --> 5193.30]  as we sing holy, holy, holy
[5193.30 --> 5213.26]  I want to give you guys a blessing
[5213.26 --> 5218.60]  from Romans 15 verse 13
[5218.60 --> 5225.56]  and it says I pray that God the source of hope
[5225.56 --> 5228.84]  will fill you completely with joy and peace
[5228.84 --> 5230.70]  because you trust in him
[5230.70 --> 5233.88]  then you will overflow with confident hope
[5233.88 --> 5235.84]  through the power of the Holy Spirit
[5235.84 --> 5249.84]  well
[5249.84 --> 5253.86]  it was a lot of fun being here with you guys
[5253.86 --> 5256.62]  thank you again for having us
[5256.62 --> 5258.24]  it was wonderful
[5258.24 --> 5262.16]  I enjoyed hearing everyone sing so beautifully
[5262.16 --> 5264.38]  because you sing so good
[5264.38 --> 5267.74]  should we sing one more song together?
[5268.74 --> 5269.76]  sounds good
[5269.76 --> 5274.50]  so for the church members here
[5274.50 --> 5278.10]  that may not know of the chaos that happened
[5278.10 --> 5279.46]  over this past weekend
[5279.46 --> 5282.34]  we're going to share a little bit of that chaos with you
[5282.34 --> 5284.86]  it's a beautiful chaos though
[5284.86 --> 5287.58]  so these kids know this part
[5287.58 --> 5289.84]  and they will teach you the next part
[5289.84 --> 5293.40]  so we'll do this kind of collectively
[5293.40 --> 5297.92]  I think the kids know where this is going
[5297.92 --> 5302.68]  so let's give them a taste of how loud you sang
[5302.68 --> 5303.72]  this last weekend
[5303.72 --> 5304.86]  I know it's still morning
[5304.86 --> 5306.26]  I'm still waking up
[5306.26 --> 5310.84]  but let's see if we can shake ourselves out of this a little bit
[5310.84 --> 5312.90]  so shall we sing this part again together?
[5312.90 --> 5337.56]  let's sing it one more time
[5337.56 --> 5340.10]  just to make sure everyone knows those O's
[5340.10 --> 5364.06]  beautiful
[5364.06 --> 5366.28]  so much
[5366.28 --> 5367.64]  so beautiful
[5367.64 --> 5369.66]  Matthew
[5369.66 --> 5371.50]  guitar working?
[5372.54 --> 5374.04]  because you can't do it without you
[5374.04 --> 5375.52]  oh, you need you
[5375.52 --> 5380.60]  guitar playing in the same way
[5381.40 --> 5381.90]  I feel like you can bring that heast
[5381.90 --> 5383.34]  so beautiful
[5383.34 --> 5385.56]  so you can shake even your throat
[5385.56 --> 5388.30]  and if you can shake myself
[5388.30 --> 5389.52]  along the same thing
[5389.52 --> 5390.96]  hopefully you can catch him
[5390.96 --> 5391.06]  and let me on down
[5391.06 --> 5391.48]  before we start
[5391.48 --> 5391.94]  you can use them
[5391.94 --> 5393.54]  as if you can shop
[5393.80 --> 5394.90]  and charge yourself
[5395.04 --> 5395.90]  and Norway
[5395.90 --> 5396.44]  if you can become
[5396.44 --> 5397.32]  I feel like you
[5397.32 --> 5397.80]  that's enough
[5397.80 --> 5398.30]  great
[5398.30 --> 5398.88]  for you
[5398.88 --> 5400.52]  and if you can
[5400.52 --> 5401.22]  you can get
[5401.32 --> 5402.24]  cut
[5402.24 --> 5403.56]  over
[5403.56 --> 5415.76]  No found grace sought us here
[5415.76 --> 5421.42]  What can we bring to you who drives us near
[5421.42 --> 5425.38]  Blessings or songs from our hearts
[5425.38 --> 5430.40]  Songs resounding grace that tore our shame apart
[5430.40 --> 5435.44]  Let us all praise the Lord
[5435.44 --> 5439.54]  He is Lord
[5439.54 --> 5440.06]  Everybody
[5440.06 --> 5440.98]  Oh
[5440.98 --> 5443.06]  Oh
[5443.06 --> 5445.74]  Oh
[5445.74 --> 5447.74]  Oh
[5447.74 --> 5449.74]  Oh
[5449.74 --> 5450.74]  Oh
[5450.74 --> 5451.74]  Oh
[5451.74 --> 5453.74]  Oh
[5453.74 --> 5458.74]  Blessings
[5458.74 --> 5472.62]  Such love you have showed
[5472.62 --> 5477.84]  This is the greatest love the world has ever known
[5477.84 --> 5481.84]  This melody we lend to you
[5481.84 --> 5487.16]  A song of adoration declaring repentance
[5487.16 --> 5492.36]  Let us all praise the Lord
[5492.36 --> 5495.72]  He is Lord
[5495.72 --> 5497.72]  Oh
[5497.72 --> 5499.72]  Oh
[5499.72 --> 5502.72]  Oh
[5502.72 --> 5504.72]  Oh

[5515.26 --> 5516.12]  What
[5516.12 --> 5518.04]  Brace waves down
[5518.04 --> 5519.18]  These luck surrounding
[5519.18 --> 5523.12]  Your peace Please tell me
[5523.12 --> 5530.48]  Jesus My anything
[5530.48 --> 5532.48]  May
[5554.48 --> 5558.48]  Though some scars may remain
[5558.48 --> 5560.48]  Through sorrow and sadness
[5560.48 --> 5563.48]  Your love remains the same
[5563.48 --> 5571.48]  You are who we long for
[5575.48 --> 5577.48]  We call that a false ending
[5579.48 --> 5582.48]  And it just prolongs for a long time
[5583.48 --> 5586.48]  And you wonder, is that how the song ends?
[5586.48 --> 5588.48]  No, it doesn't
[5589.48 --> 5592.48]  We claim to be across the foundation
[5592.48 --> 5594.48]  Assured
[5594.48 --> 5598.48]  And the song is great as the Lord
[5598.48 --> 5602.48]  He is Lord
[5602.48 --> 5604.48]  And it's a song
[5604.48 --> 5608.48]  Oh
[5608.48 --> 5610.48]  Oh
[5610.48 --> 5612.48]  Oh
[5612.48 --> 5614.48]  Oh
[5614.48 --> 5616.48]  Oh
[5617.48 --> 5619.48]  Oh
[5619.48 --> 5621.48]  Oh
[5621.48 --> 5623.48]  Oh
[5623.48 --> 5625.48]  Oh
[5625.48 --> 5627.48]  Oh
[5627.48 --> 5629.48]  Oh
[5629.48 --> 5631.48]  Oh
[5631.48 --> 5633.48]  Oh
[5633.48 --> 5635.48]  Oh
[5636.48 --> 5637.48]  Oh
[5637.48 --> 5639.48]  Oh
[5639.48 --> 5641.48]  Oh
[5641.48 --> 5643.48]  Oh
[5643.48 --> 5645.48]  Oh
[5645.48 --> 5646.48]  Oh
[5646.48 --> 5647.48]  Oh
[5647.48 --> 5648.48]  Oh
[5648.48 --> 5649.48]  Oh
[5649.48 --> 5650.48]  Oh
[5650.48 --> 5651.48]  Oh
[5651.48 --> 5653.48]  Oh
[5653.48 --> 5654.48]  Oh
[5654.48 --> 5655.48]  Oh
[5655.48 --> 5656.48]  Oh
[5656.48 --> 5657.48]  Oh
[5657.48 --> 5658.48]  Oh
[5658.48 --> 5659.48]  Amen. Amen. Amen.
[5659.48 --> 5666.48]  Please just have a quick seat. A couple quick housekeeping things before we go enjoy fellowship in the foy
[5666.48 --> 5667.02]  in the four
