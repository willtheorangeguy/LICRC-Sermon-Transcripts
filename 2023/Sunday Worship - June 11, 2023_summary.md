• The theological argument in Romans is that humanity fell into sin when Adam and Eve rebelled against God, resulting in all descendants being impacted by sin, affecting every area of life.

• The pain of childbirth is worth it due to the joy and glory of holding one's child.
• Human history shows that most women who have given birth have done so more than once, indicating that the experience is worth it despite its difficulty.
• Similarly, people endure present sufferings with hope for a better future, but this hope must be in something unseen.
• The world around us can be seen as a picture of what is to come, and even though it may be imperfect or frustrating, it gives us a glimpse into the future.
