• Distinguishing between grand, dramatic testimonies and quiet, ordinary stories of God's faithfulness
• Exploring how Abraham's story is a model for the church's calling and the importance of using one's story for God's glory
• The church is called to go into unfamiliar territory like Abraham, relying on God's promises
• The story of Abraham begins before his introduction in Genesis, where Adam and Eve's family lines are established
• Torah, Abraham's father, worshipped other gods and lost hope for humanity
• Hope must come from outside the land, which is why God calls Abraham to leave his country and people

• Shift from assuming a universal moral order to recognize changing societal norms
• The Bible sets a high standard for sexual ethics, not to prevent flourishing or steal joy, but to increase joy and opportunity for flourishing.
• This high standard reflects God's design and intent for human life.
• A church father named Aaron News believed the glory of God is the human being fully alive, and pursuing this glory leads to joy and fulfillment.
• Many churches struggle to discuss sex and sexuality openly and honestly, leading to a disconnect between what people believe about the Bible and their actual practices.
• It's easy for individuals to assume they have a better plan than God or scripture when it comes to complex issues like abortion, end-of-life care, and drug use.
• The current societal landscape is unprecedented and challenging for the church
• Being a disciple of Jesus in this new context requires re-examining traditional practices
• The church must adapt to a changing world without compromising core values or becoming "progressive"
• Historical truths remain essential, but their application may need to evolve in response to changing circumstances

• Faith requires taking action before seeing results
• Living by faith means living as strangers or foreigners in one's own land
• Trusting God despite uncertainty and lack of clear guidance
• The Christian life is about trusting in God's promises and stepping out into the unknown
• Faith involves doing what you don't know how to do or where it will lead
• It takes faith to ask God for guidance when there is no clear plan or map
• The question is not what we are going to do, but how we will step forward with the right attitude and faith
• Abraham's story is an example of stepping out in faith, as he trusted in God's promises despite uncertainty.
• The promise of blessing to every nation starts with the sun
• God told Abraham to look to the sun as a guarantee of world blessing
• Isaac points us to the true and better sun, Jesus
• Jesus follows the same pattern by leaving his family and giving up comfort for a world that did not recognize him
• He came to his own but was rejected, even to death on a cross
• The reference to Abraham being called to a land he didn't know is likened to Jesus' journey into the abyss and his prayer in the garden.
• The cup of God's wrath against sin is referenced, which Jesus bears.
• When God calls people to new places or off the map, he says "look to the sun" (referring to Jesus).
• In an increasingly post-Christian world, people will look like Abraham, forever foreigners in a new land.
• Faith heroes, including Abraham, were living by faith and didn't receive the promises made but only saw them from afar.
• They are described as strangers on earth, looking for their own country.
• Fixing one's eyes on Jesus and a future secured in heaven
• The role of faith heroes, such as Abraham, in pointing to Christ
• The call to perseverance and running the race marked out for us
• Jesus as the pioneer and perfecter of our faith
• The joy set before him that he endured the cross for
• Jesus was sent to a land he knew, but the world did not know as a blessing
• Believers are now called to send themselves into unfamiliar lands, trusting in God's promise of provision and protection
• The truth of the gospel is that every knee will bow and confess Jesus Christ as Lord
• God's joy is to save and find those who were lost, and he alone can do it
• Believers are sent out never alone, with Jesus' presence and guidance in their journey
• God will equip and bless believers for the journey, turning their abilities into opportunities to serve him
• The faith requires giving up security and trusting God's call

• He received an email with a list of churches in need of pastors, including one that he contacted with a letter
• The speaker had emailed Trinity Church in St. Catharines about being a student pastor
• They received an initial rejection response, but then were offered pulpit supply on May 15th
• The speaker's wife Rachel claimed that God had told her three years ago that they would serve at Trinity Church
• Despite having no family or history connection to the church, the speaker and his family ended up attending Trinity Church
• The search committee later contacted the speaker about being a student pastor after initial rejection
