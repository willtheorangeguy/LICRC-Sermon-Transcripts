[0.00 --> 6.00]  Let us pray...
[30.00 --> 49.40]  I want you as you are not as you ought to be
[49.40 --> 54.44]  Won't you lay down your guard and come to me
[54.44 --> 59.96]  The shame that grips you now is crippling
[59.96 --> 65.44]  It breaks my heart to see you suffering
[65.44 --> 72.86]  Cause I am for you, I'm not against you
[72.86 --> 78.22]  If you wanna know how far my love can go
[78.22 --> 81.78]  Just how deep, just how wide
[81.78 --> 85.68]  If you wanna see how much you mean to me
[85.68 --> 89.48]  Look at my hands, look at my side
[89.48 --> 94.96]  If you could count the times that day you are forgiven
[94.96 --> 98.44]  It's more than the drops in the ocean
[98.44 --> 110.12]  Don't think you need to settle for a substitute
[110.12 --> 115.60]  When I'm the only love that changes you
[115.60 --> 122.08]  And I am for you, I'm not against you
[122.08 --> 129.08]  I am for you, I'm not against you
[129.08 --> 134.56]  If you wanna know how far my love can go
[134.56 --> 138.56]  Just how deep, just how wide
[138.56 --> 142.36]  If you wanna see how much you mean to me
[142.36 --> 145.56]  Look at my hands, look at my side
[145.56 --> 150.56]  If you could count the times that day you are forgiven
[150.56 --> 154.04]  It's more than the drops in the ocean
[154.04 --> 155.04]  It's more than the drops in the ocean
[155.04 --> 162.04]  Drops in the ocean
[162.04 --> 166.72]  Open your heart, it's time that we start again
[166.72 --> 174.32]  Open your heart, it's time that we start again
[174.32 --> 180.26]  If you wanna know how far my life can go
[180.26 --> 183.50]  Just how deep, just how wide
[183.50 --> 187.74]  If you wanna see how much you mean to me
[187.74 --> 191.04]  Look at my hands, look at my side
[191.04 --> 196.72]  If you could count the times of day you are forgiven
[196.72 --> 200.18]  It's more than the drops in the ocean
[200.18 --> 208.32]  The drops in the ocean
[208.32 --> 216.32]  I'm crying for you
[216.32 --> 220.38]  I'm not against you
[220.38 --> 224.06]  I am for you
[224.06 --> 228.06]  I'm not against you
[228.06 --> 236.94]  You're not the only one who feels like this
[236.94 --> 240.62]  Feeling like you lose more than you win
[240.62 --> 244.62]  Like life is just an endless hill you climb
[244.62 --> 248.62]  You try and try but never arrive
[248.62 --> 252.30]  I'm telling you something
[252.30 --> 254.30]  This racing, this running
[254.30 --> 256.30]  Oh, you're working way too hard
[256.30 --> 258.30]  You're working way too hard
[258.30 --> 260.30]  And this perfection you're chasing
[260.30 --> 273.98]  Is just energy wasted
[273.98 --> 277.66]  Cause he loves you like you are
[277.66 --> 279.66]  So go ahead and live like you're loved
[279.66 --> 283.66]  It's okay to act like you've been set free
[283.66 --> 287.34]  His love has made you more than enough
[287.34 --> 289.34]  So go ahead and be who he made you to be
[289.34 --> 291.34]  And live like you're loved
[291.34 --> 301.02]  Live like you're loved
[301.02 --> 303.02]  Live like you're loved
[303.02 --> 306.46]  Live like you're loved.
[306.46 --> 310.46]  Live like you're loved.
[310.46 --> 314.70]  And live like you know you're valuable.
[314.70 --> 318.46]  Like you know the one that holds your soul.
[318.46 --> 322.46]  Cause mercy has called you by your name.
[322.46 --> 326.94]  Don't be afraid to live in that grace.
[326.94 --> 329.50]  Oh, I'm telling you something.
[329.50 --> 331.50]  This God we believe in.
[331.50 --> 335.02]  Yeah, he changed everything.
[335.02 --> 337.14]  No more guilt, no more shame.
[337.14 --> 339.98]  He took all that away.
[339.98 --> 342.46]  Gave us a reason to sing.
[342.46 --> 346.78]  So go ahead and live like you're loved.
[346.78 --> 350.54]  It's okay to act like you've been set free.
[350.54 --> 354.46]  His love has made you more than enough.
[354.46 --> 358.54]  So go ahead and be who he made you to be.
[358.54 --> 362.46]  And live like you're loved.
[362.46 --> 365.98]  Live like you're loved.
[365.98 --> 374.06]  Live like you're loved.
[374.06 --> 378.28]  Live like you're loved, walk like you're free
[378.28 --> 382.30]  Stay like you know who we made you to be
[382.30 --> 386.26]  Live like you're loved, like you believe
[386.26 --> 390.32]  His love is all that you'll ever need
[390.32 --> 393.52]  So go ahead and live like you're loved
[393.52 --> 401.54]  His love has made you more than enough
[404.06 --> 409.50]  So go ahead and live like you're loved
[409.50 --> 414.14]  It's okay to act like you've been set free
[414.14 --> 417.84]  His love has made you more than enough
[417.84 --> 422.36]  So go ahead and be who he made you to be
[422.36 --> 424.22]  And live like you're loved
[424.22 --> 428.22]  Live like you're loved
[428.22 --> 430.24]  Live like you're loved
[430.24 --> 432.24]  Live like you're loved
[432.24 --> 436.24]  Live like you're loved
[436.24 --> 438.48]  Live like you're loved
[438.48 --> 440.38]  Live like you're loved
[440.38 --> 442.28]  Walk like you're free
[442.28 --> 446.32]  Stay like you know who we made you to be
[446.32 --> 448.40]  Live like you're loved
[448.40 --> 450.40]  Like you believe
[450.40 --> 454.36]  His love is all that you'll ever need
[454.36 --> 456.24]  Live like you're loved
[456.24 --> 460.24]  Live like you're loved
[460.24 --> 462.24]  Live like you're loved
[462.24 --> 464.20]  When you're at the end of the road
[464.20 --> 470.20]  And it's not the one that you would have chosen
[470.20 --> 472.20]  When you're at the end of your road
[472.20 --> 474.20]  And you're holding on
[474.20 --> 476.20]  But feel like you're falling
[476.20 --> 478.20]  With every option
[478.20 --> 480.20]  You tried everything you know
[480.20 --> 482.20]  You saw light then you lost it
[482.20 --> 484.20]  But there is still hope
[484.20 --> 486.20]  Like the fire
[486.20 --> 488.20]  And you're not the one that you would have chosen
[488.20 --> 490.20]  When you're at the end of your road
[490.20 --> 492.20]  And you're holding on
[492.20 --> 494.20]  But feel like you're falling
[494.20 --> 496.20]  With every option exhausted
[496.20 --> 498.20]  You tried everything you know
[498.20 --> 500.20]  You saw light then you lost it
[500.20 --> 502.20]  You saw light then you lost it
[502.20 --> 504.20]  But there is still hope
[504.20 --> 508.20]  Like the fire in the night
[508.20 --> 512.20]  Like the ocean parted wide
[512.20 --> 514.20]  Like the grave empty inside
[514.20 --> 518.20]  You will see he still does
[518.20 --> 522.20]  You will see he still does
[522.20 --> 524.20]  Miracles
[524.20 --> 526.20]  Miracles
[526.20 --> 528.20]  Miracles
[528.20 --> 530.20]  Miracles
[530.20 --> 533.20]  Even if you don't see it now
[533.20 --> 535.20]  Without a doubt
[535.20 --> 538.20]  He's already moving
[538.20 --> 541.20]  There's not a pain that you hold
[541.20 --> 543.20]  He doesn't know
[543.20 --> 546.20]  And he isn't using
[546.20 --> 550.20]  With every option exhausted
[550.20 --> 554.20]  You tried everything you know
[554.20 --> 558.20]  So reach for something beyond it
[558.20 --> 560.20]  Cause he is our hope
[560.20 --> 564.20]  Like the fire in the night
[564.20 --> 568.20]  Like the ocean parted wide
[568.20 --> 572.20]  Like the grave empty inside
[572.20 --> 574.20]  You will see he still does
[574.20 --> 576.20]  Miracles
[576.20 --> 578.20]  Miracles
[578.20 --> 580.20]  Miracles
[580.20 --> 582.20]  Miracles
[582.20 --> 584.20]  Miracles
[584.20 --> 586.20]  Miracles
[586.20 --> 588.20]  Miracles
[588.20 --> 590.20]  Miracles
[590.20 --> 592.20]  Miracles
[592.20 --> 594.20]  Miracles
[594.20 --> 596.20]  A broken heart can be restored
[596.20 --> 600.20]  A broken soul can be reborn
[600.20 --> 602.20]  And greater things
[602.20 --> 604.20]  And greater things are still in store
[604.20 --> 606.20]  For us
[606.20 --> 608.20]  For us
[608.20 --> 610.20]  For us
[610.20 --> 614.20]  Like the fire in the night
[614.20 --> 618.20]  Like the ocean parted wide
[618.20 --> 620.20]  Like the grave empty inside
[620.20 --> 624.20]  You will see he still does
[624.20 --> 626.20]  Miracles
[626.20 --> 630.20]  Miracles
[630.20 --> 632.20]  Miracles
[632.20 --> 634.20]  Miracles
[634.20 --> 635.20]  Miracles
[635.20 --> 636.20]  Miracles
[636.20 --> 637.20]  Miracles
[637.20 --> 638.20]  We still don't
[638.20 --> 640.20]  We still don't
[640.20 --> 641.20]  We still don't
[641.20 --> 642.20]  Miracles
[642.20 --> 643.20]  Yeah
[643.20 --> 644.20]  More than you
[644.20 --> 646.18]  I've ever dreamed
[646.18 --> 648.20]  More than you
[648.20 --> 650.20]  I've ever been
[650.20 --> 658.20]  Destin-me, destin-me, miracle
[680.20 --> 692.20]  Destin-me, miracle
[692.20 --> 703.20]  Destin-me, miracle
[703.20 --> 709.20]  Destin-me, miracle
[709.20 --> 711.82]  Never measure up.
[717.52 --> 724.72]  Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low?
[730.72 --> 737.92]  Remind me once again just who I am because I need to know.
[739.20 --> 747.96]  Ooh, you say I am loved when I can't feel a thing.
[748.62 --> 754.48]  You say I am strong when I think I am weak.
[755.20 --> 760.94]  And you say I am held when I am falling short.
[761.58 --> 767.66]  And when I don't belong, oh, you say I am yours.
[767.66 --> 777.42]  And I believe, oh, I believe what you say of me.
[777.42 --> 780.54]  I believe, I believe.
[782.22 --> 789.42]  The only thing that matters now is everything you think of me.
[789.42 --> 796.42]  You say I am strong when I think I am weak.
[796.42 --> 798.76]  I find my worth in you.
[798.96 --> 802.22]  I find my identity.
[805.18 --> 806.18]  Ooh, oh.
[807.18 --> 812.66]  You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing.
[813.18 --> 819.32]  You say I am strong when I think I am weak.
[819.32 --> 825.96]  And you say I am held when I am falling short.
[826.68 --> 832.42]  When I don't belong, oh, you say I am yours.
[833.08 --> 842.28]  And I believe, oh, I believe what you say of me.
[842.28 --> 842.72]  Ooh.
[843.44 --> 843.80]  Ooh.
[843.80 --> 846.04]  Oh, I believe what you say of me.
[846.04 --> 846.60]  Ooh.
[846.60 --> 847.04]  Ooh.
[849.46 --> 850.04]  Ooh.
[853.46 --> 854.92]  Good morning, everyone.
[855.22 --> 856.32]  We're all awake now.
[856.90 --> 858.68]  It's good to see so many of you here today.
[858.78 --> 861.50]  Welcome to Emanuel CRC Church this morning.
[861.92 --> 862.78]  My name is Kevin Lobert.
[862.84 --> 863.98]  I'm the youth pastor here.
[864.36 --> 868.64]  And it's a pleasure to be up here this morning in front of you all,
[868.74 --> 870.98]  worshiping God together and opening his word today.
[870.98 --> 874.70]  I'm going to invite Brandon Muller and Josh Chamberlain to the front.
[874.82 --> 876.34]  They've got an announcement each to make.
[876.92 --> 881.48]  As they make their way up here, on October the 29th,
[881.52 --> 887.50]  we are having a little bit of a worship service at the evening time, 6 p.m.,
[887.50 --> 889.32]  and we've called it Revival Hymns.
[889.82 --> 893.42]  We invite all of you to come out to that, invite your neighbors and your friends.
[893.56 --> 897.28]  Revival Hymns is going to be an evening where we sing old hymns
[897.28 --> 900.06]  in kind of a folk country style.
[900.06 --> 901.74]  So it should be a pretty fun night.
[902.18 --> 905.08]  We've got some excellent leaders leading the charge for that evening.
[905.28 --> 908.68]  So circle that date on your calendar, October 29th at 6 p.m.
[909.06 --> 912.34]  Also a reminder, we're still putting together that community art project.
[912.98 --> 916.74]  Our mission statement here at LICRC is gather, grow, go.
[916.96 --> 922.20]  And we are inviting you to send in a picture of the other places you spend your time
[922.20 --> 923.28]  that aren't this church.
[923.68 --> 925.08]  So perhaps it's where you work.
[925.30 --> 926.42]  Perhaps it's where you play.
[926.42 --> 930.78]  We invite you to snap a picture or two of those places and send them into the office,
[930.78 --> 933.90]  and we're going to put together a bit of an art project with that.
[934.06 --> 937.48]  So Brandon, why don't you come up here right now?
[939.36 --> 940.08]  All right.
[940.18 --> 943.38]  So it's probably a little bit weird seeing me up here this early,
[943.50 --> 944.92]  but it does mean what it means.
[945.36 --> 948.96]  Mexico sign-up is starting today and running until the end of October.
[948.96 --> 951.88]  So things in Mexico changed a little bit.
[952.30 --> 953.62]  Accommodations have shut down because of COVID.
[953.78 --> 955.22]  As a result, there's not as many to book,
[955.32 --> 957.48]  which means we've got to book it early so we can beat the other churches
[957.48 --> 959.48]  and be the ones to go down there.
[959.76 --> 961.08]  So it is competition.
[961.24 --> 962.66]  Let's go over quickly a couple of the details.
[963.46 --> 966.10]  So the trip cost will be $11.50 again this year.
[966.42 --> 968.30]  We're not anticipating a change in that.
[969.06 --> 970.44]  The dates as well.
[971.08 --> 973.70]  LCS did not mess up spring break this year, which is great.
[974.14 --> 978.22]  So we're going to do March 16th, which is the Saturday we'll be leaving.
[978.62 --> 980.18]  Return date is a little bit up in the air.
[980.26 --> 981.80]  We can't actually book that until later.
[981.92 --> 983.52]  They don't actually have flights for it yet.
[983.88 --> 986.58]  But usually we anticipate the 25th or the 26th,
[986.60 --> 989.00]  which is a Saturday to a Monday or Tuesday.
[989.56 --> 990.70]  So we're there for two Sundays.
[991.54 --> 992.66]  This year is going to be pretty cool.
[992.66 --> 995.42]  We've got a lot of stuff planned already.
[996.44 --> 998.76]  So the biggest one, the biggest change is we're actually getting involved
[998.76 --> 1002.18]  with a lot of churches in our local area that work in Rosarito now.
[1002.18 --> 1004.98]  We're going to be building like a kind of a coalition of churches,
[1005.14 --> 1006.84]  whatever you want to call it, where we partner together
[1006.84 --> 1008.70]  and try to help each other out in their ministries.
[1009.34 --> 1012.22]  As a result, this year we'll be working with Abilino, with Jody,
[1012.62 --> 1014.24]  but we'll also be going to an orphanage again,
[1014.46 --> 1016.88]  which is something I think we've been missing for the last bunch of years.
[1017.40 --> 1019.86]  But there's a local church that runs an orphanage down there,
[1019.90 --> 1021.62]  and we'll be working with them this year too.
[1022.50 --> 1024.50]  Beyond that, we'll be breaking ground on,
[1024.54 --> 1026.82]  I think we've been talking about it for years, COVID kind of messed it up,
[1026.86 --> 1030.82]  but we're going to be doing a single-family, single-mother, homeless shelter for Abilino.
[1030.82 --> 1032.48]  We'll be breaking ground on that this year.
[1033.12 --> 1036.14]  So you adults that have construction experience, please sign up this year.
[1036.20 --> 1038.24]  I know you guys have been saying it for years that have been bugging you,
[1038.30 --> 1038.84]  but you never do.
[1040.52 --> 1043.00]  Beyond that, we're also going to reactivate goes to Mexico.
[1043.42 --> 1045.26]  We're going to try to do a smaller version of it.
[1045.60 --> 1047.24]  Who knows, it is Mexico, maybe it goes bigger,
[1047.38 --> 1050.48]  but we're going to try to bring kind of our youth convention stuff
[1050.48 --> 1053.64]  to our youth program we do down there and the youth work we do with them.
[1053.84 --> 1055.24]  So that'll be cool.
[1055.40 --> 1056.16]  Who can sign up?
[1056.16 --> 1058.66]  That's always the big one too that we've been after the last year.
[1059.30 --> 1061.28]  Technically, so it's always been grade 10 and above,
[1061.42 --> 1064.20]  all the way up to whatever age you want to go at.
[1064.82 --> 1067.20]  But we also do allow families to go.
[1067.28 --> 1070.34]  You don't have to be, like you can be younger than grade 10,
[1070.40 --> 1072.64]  you can still go, you need a parent, guardian with you.
[1073.20 --> 1075.46]  So for example, I bring my daughter every year.
[1076.18 --> 1077.40]  Kevin Loebers brought his daughter.
[1078.04 --> 1079.32]  We've had a lot of people who's wondering,
[1079.40 --> 1080.50]  hey, can I bring my family?
[1080.74 --> 1081.32]  Yes, you can.
[1081.32 --> 1084.18]  So the costs do change for kids a little bit.
[1084.26 --> 1086.10]  They don't eat as much so we don't get charged for them,
[1086.16 --> 1087.42]  things like that for a lot of stuff.
[1088.18 --> 1089.76]  But we can kind of talk about that.
[1089.82 --> 1091.84]  I'll have the sign up back there at the Connect desk.
[1093.12 --> 1094.92]  The sign up we're not going to be doing, like,
[1095.32 --> 1097.18]  I get it's a long delay in the future
[1097.18 --> 1098.88]  and you can't necessarily 100% confirm.
[1099.42 --> 1102.48]  But if you are 70% I am going, please sign up for it
[1102.48 --> 1104.28]  so we can get our accommodations down pat.
[1104.80 --> 1107.38]  And then the actual true application sign up
[1107.38 --> 1109.04]  will come out in this normal time in December.
[1109.04 --> 1112.46]  But, yeah, I just want to encourage families, adults,
[1112.54 --> 1114.26]  even if you aren't coming with your kids,
[1114.84 --> 1116.66]  everybody to kind of come to this trip this year.
[1116.84 --> 1117.54]  It's going to be a big one.
[1117.58 --> 1118.50]  It's going to be an awesome one.
[1119.20 --> 1120.96]  And it's kind of exciting to see.
[1121.12 --> 1122.34]  So that is it for me.
[1125.52 --> 1128.38]  So unfortunately we have to, for the young adults,
[1128.46 --> 1131.06]  we have to postpone the campfire worship night
[1131.06 --> 1133.28]  to a later date that we still have to find,
[1133.90 --> 1134.84]  which is sad.
[1134.84 --> 1138.62]  But next Sunday is the Bible study starting back up,
[1138.82 --> 1140.46]  which we'd love to have you guys there,
[1140.96 --> 1142.68]  resuming where we left off from 1 Corinthians
[1142.68 --> 1144.18]  at my house.
[1144.98 --> 1145.18]  Yeah.
[1147.06 --> 1148.18]  Josh, you're so long-winded.
[1151.38 --> 1153.36]  Just a few more announcements here this morning.
[1154.06 --> 1156.24]  Youth, we have 2020 tonight,
[1156.36 --> 1158.84]  so do come out to the church tonight at 6.30 p.m.
[1158.84 --> 1160.46]  It's our first 2020 of the year.
[1160.46 --> 1163.46]  I'd love to see you all out to that tonight.
[1164.30 --> 1166.56]  Congregation, we're still looking for a few volunteers.
[1166.88 --> 1169.96]  I am looking for a catechism teacher
[1169.96 --> 1172.26]  for the grade 9 and 10 students.
[1172.36 --> 1174.82]  If that's something that you have a heart for
[1174.82 --> 1176.24]  or something you've got the gifts for,
[1176.30 --> 1177.48]  please come chat with me.
[1177.84 --> 1178.82]  That would be awesome.
[1179.94 --> 1181.74]  Finally, you might be wondering
[1181.74 --> 1184.54]  where the fellow with the bigger beard,
[1184.66 --> 1186.48]  who speaks more eloquently than I,
[1186.64 --> 1187.62]  is this morning.
[1187.62 --> 1190.66]  Pastor Chris and Rachel have headed off to Ontario.
[1190.94 --> 1191.92]  They took off on Friday
[1191.92 --> 1194.50]  because Rachel's grandmother passed away this week.
[1195.04 --> 1197.40]  And so Pastor Chris is going to be leading the funeral.
[1197.74 --> 1199.02]  The visitation is tomorrow,
[1199.16 --> 1200.62]  and the funeral will be on Tuesday,
[1200.62 --> 1203.00]  so you can keep our pastor and his family
[1203.00 --> 1205.00]  in your prayers this week.
[1205.42 --> 1207.94]  That means today we get the pleasure
[1207.94 --> 1211.26]  of having Reverend Dr. Ed Gerber to the pulpit,
[1211.36 --> 1213.66]  so he will be leading us in God's Word today.
[1213.82 --> 1216.34]  Ed is the chaplain and director of student ministries
[1216.34 --> 1217.88]  at Trinity Western University,
[1218.10 --> 1220.28]  and so it's a pleasure to have you here this morning.
[1220.38 --> 1221.80]  Ed, thanks for being here.
[1222.32 --> 1225.12]  I'm going to invite you all to rise now, please,
[1225.18 --> 1227.32]  as we receive God's greeting this morning.
[1231.72 --> 1233.94]  God's greeting comes from Revelation 1.
[1234.66 --> 1237.72]  Grace and peace to you from him who is
[1237.72 --> 1240.24]  and who was and who is to come,
[1240.50 --> 1243.36]  and from the seven spirits that are before his throne,
[1243.36 --> 1246.78]  and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness,
[1247.24 --> 1248.54]  the firstborn of the dead,
[1248.86 --> 1251.14]  and the ruler of the kings of the earth.
[1251.98 --> 1252.32]  Amen.
[1252.68 --> 1253.86]  As God has greeted us this morning,
[1253.96 --> 1255.76]  please take a moment to greet those around you.
[1255.76 --> 1255.96]  Amen.

[1290.26 --> 1291.36]  Amen.
[1291.36 --> 1294.22]  Our call to worship comes from Psalm 47.
[1294.22 --> 1295.22]  Amen.
[1295.22 --> 1299.46]  Clap your hands, all you nations, shout to God with cries of joy.
[1299.46 --> 1302.26]  For the Lord Most High is awesome, the great King of the world,
[1302.26 --> 1304.26]  the great King over all the earth.
[1304.26 --> 1308.26]  He subdued nations under us, peoples under our feet.
[1308.26 --> 1313.26]  He chose our inheritance for us, the pride of Jacob, whom he loved.
[1313.26 --> 1319.26]  God has ascended amid shouts of joy, the Lord amid the sounding of trumpets.
[1319.26 --> 1322.26]  Sing praises to God, sing praises.
[1322.26 --> 1325.26]  Sing praises to our King, sing praises.

[1583.60 --> 1590.60]  Oh God so loved the world that He gave us.
[1590.60 --> 1595.46]  He's one and only, He's time to save us.
[1595.60 --> 1600.24]  Heaven believe in Him, He'll live forever.
[1600.24 --> 1607.24]  Bring all your failures, bring your addictions.
[1608.50 --> 1612.32]  Come lay them down at the foot of the cross.
[1612.32 --> 1618.32]  Jesus is waiting to open up.
[1620.32 --> 1625.48]  Oh God so loved the world that He gave us.
[1625.48 --> 1629.32]  He's one and only, He's time to save us.
[1629.32 --> 1634.32]  He's willing to believe in Him, He'll live forever.

[1670.32 --> 1691.32]  God so loved, God so loved, God so loved, God so loved.
[1691.32 --> 1694.32]  For God so loved, the world that He gave us.
[1694.32 --> 1698.32]  His one and only, He's time to save us.
[1698.32 --> 1703.32]  For God so loved, the world that He gave us.

[1718.32 --> 1720.32]  His one and only, He's time to save us.
[1720.32 --> 1724.32]  And now it is well, I'm walking in freedom.
[1724.32 --> 1733.32]  For God so loved, God so loved the world.
[1733.32 --> 1737.32]  Bring all your failures, bring your addictions.
[1738.32 --> 1741.32]  Come lay them down at the foot of the cross.
[1741.32 --> 1743.32]  Jesus is waiting.
[1743.32 --> 1744.32]  Jesus is waiting.
[1744.32 --> 1749.32]  God so loved the world.
[1753.32 --> 1759.32]  I invite you to be seated.
[1759.32 --> 1763.32]  Our confession this morning comes from Psalm 66,
[1763.32 --> 1764.32]  where it says,
[1764.32 --> 1767.32]  Shout for joy to God all the earth.
[1767.32 --> 1769.32]  Sing the glory of His name.
[1769.32 --> 1771.32]  Make His praise glorious.
[1771.32 --> 1775.32]  Say to God, how awesome are your deeds.
[1775.32 --> 1780.32]  So great is your power that your enemies cringe before you.
[1780.32 --> 1783.32]  All the earth bows down to you.
[1783.32 --> 1785.32]  They sing praise to you.
[1785.32 --> 1788.32]  They sing the praises of your name.
[1788.32 --> 1792.32]  When Doreen and I were doing our devotions,
[1792.32 --> 1798.32]  the one line that caught my eye was,
[1798.32 --> 1801.32]  Shout to God with cries of joy.
[1801.32 --> 1803.32]  And shout for joy to God.
[1803.32 --> 1805.32]  And I found myself thinking,
[1805.32 --> 1811.32]  How often am I so captivated by God's beauty,
[1811.32 --> 1813.32]  so awed by His power,
[1813.32 --> 1815.32]  so amazed by His love,
[1815.32 --> 1818.32]  and sheltered under His wing.
[1818.32 --> 1822.32]  I hate it when I get emotional.
[1822.32 --> 1828.32]  That the only response is to shout for joy.
[1828.32 --> 1834.32]  That praise just bubbles up from my heart.
[1834.32 --> 1841.32]  And my longing is to dwell in His presence all my days.
[1841.32 --> 1844.32]  And how I long this for us.
[1844.32 --> 1849.32]  That we can focus on the goodness of God within the world of trouble.
[1849.32 --> 1855.32]  And that we can learn to rest in His love when we bow our heads.
[1855.32 --> 1857.32]  When we bow our heads.
[1857.32 --> 1862.32]  Father, how easy it is for us to focus our sight.
[1862.32 --> 1864.32]  Sorry, let me start over.
[1864.32 --> 1868.32]  Father, how easy it is for us to lose our sight of you.
[1868.32 --> 1872.32]  Our whole culture is shouting that we can make it on our own.
[1872.32 --> 1874.32]  That we don't need you, Abba Father.
[1874.32 --> 1879.32]  And it's easy to start thinking that life is all about our success and our comfort.
[1879.32 --> 1884.32]  Making it easy to place ourselves in the pinnacle of our lives.
[1884.32 --> 1889.32]  Father, forgive us for not seeing who you are.
[1889.32 --> 1897.32]  For pushing you on the sideline just in case we need you.
[1897.32 --> 1903.32]  Father, once again, we ask that you show us your beauty.
[1903.32 --> 1909.32]  Holy Spirit, renew our hearts to shout your praise.
[1909.32 --> 1915.32]  And help us to offer our lives as a sacrifice of worship to you.
[1915.32 --> 1916.32]  Amen.
[1916.32 --> 1920.32]  Let us stand as we sing the next few songs.
[1920.32 --> 1925.32] volume of theシgos and pバイIch wil Jeremy
[1925.32 --> 1931.32]  At the Jewish temple are near the Far� out,
[1931.32 --> 1933.32]  we of the elders in our live town.
[1933.32 --> 1935.32]  Let us stand as a miracle's grace.
[1935.32 --> 1937.32]  Let us stand as we sing the same song.
[1937.32 --> 1944.82]  Falling down in worship to sing the song of ages to the land.
[1946.50 --> 1952.64]  And all who've gone before us and all who will believe
[1952.64 --> 1957.64]  will sing the song of ages to the land.
[1958.76 --> 1966.64]  Your name is the highest, your name is the greatest, your name.
[1967.32 --> 1970.38]  It stands above all.
[1971.84 --> 1979.26]  All thrones and dominions of God and positions of your name
[1979.26 --> 1982.54]  stands above all.
[1982.54 --> 1985.02]  You shall cry.
[1985.90 --> 1991.34]  Falling all creation, Christ.
[1991.34 --> 1997.20]  Falling, you are dead in Christ.
[1998.40 --> 2002.94]  Falling, only forever.
[2002.94 --> 2004.94]  Falling, only forever.
[2004.94 --> 2005.94]  Falling, only forever.
[2005.94 --> 2007.94]  Falling, only forever.
[2007.94 --> 2013.94]  And if you've been forgiven, and if you've been redeemed,
[2013.94 --> 2018.94]  sing the song forever to the land.
[2018.94 --> 2025.94]  And if you are in freedom, and if you've been redeemed,
[2025.94 --> 2030.94]  sing the song forever to the land.
[2030.94 --> 2031.94]  Falling, only forever.
[2031.94 --> 2032.94]  Falling, only forever.
[2032.94 --> 2033.94]  Sing the song forever.
[2033.94 --> 2037.94]  And if you've been redeemed, and if you've been redeemed,
[2037.94 --> 2039.94]  I'm holding, only forever.
[2039.94 --> 2043.94]  Falling, only forever.
[2043.94 --> 2044.94]  Falling, only forever.
[2044.94 --> 2046.08]  I'm holding, only forever.
[2046.08 --> 2050.94]  Falling, only forever.
[2050.94 --> 2057.34]  Holy, holy forever
[2057.34 --> 2063.34]  Hear your people sing
[2063.34 --> 2069.16]  Holy, holy to the King of kings
[2069.16 --> 2075.38]  Holy, you will always sing
[2075.38 --> 2081.20]  Holy, holy forever
[2081.20 --> 2090.14]  It's the highest of your name
[2090.14 --> 2093.20]  It's the greatest of your name
[2093.20 --> 2097.30]  It stands above your own
[2097.30 --> 2102.22]  All the world and the millions of dollars
[2102.22 --> 2105.14]  And the nations of your name
[2105.14 --> 2108.82]  It stands above your own
[2108.82 --> 2111.12]  Holy, holy to the King of kings
[2111.12 --> 2114.02]  It's the highest of your name
[2114.02 --> 2117.08]  It's the greatest of your name
[2117.08 --> 2121.28]  It stands above your own
[2121.28 --> 2125.90]  All the world and the millions of dollars
[2125.90 --> 2128.86]  And the nations of your name
[2128.86 --> 2132.08]  It stands above your own
[2132.08 --> 2136.02]  And the nations of your name
[2136.02 --> 2140.06]  Holy, holy to the King of kings
[2140.06 --> 2142.02]  And the nations of your name
[2142.02 --> 2144.02]  Holy, holy to the King of kings
[2144.02 --> 2145.96]  You are risen in the Lord
[2145.96 --> 2152.00]  Holy, holy forever
[2152.00 --> 2157.96]  You will always sing
[2157.96 --> 2161.96]  Holy, holy forever
[2161.96 --> 2163.96]  Holy, holy forever
[2163.96 --> 2167.94]  You will always sing
[2167.94 --> 2169.96]  Holy, holy forever
[2169.96 --> 2171.96]  You will always sing
[2171.96 --> 2173.96]  Holy, holy forever
[2173.96 --> 2175.96]  Only forever
[2175.96 --> 2185.96]  Holy, holy to the King of kings
[2185.96 --> 2189.94]  You will always sing
[2189.94 --> 2191.94]  Holy, holy forever
[2191.94 --> 2195.94]  You will always sing
[2195.94 --> 2197.94]  Holy, holy forever
[2197.94 --> 2199.88]  You will always sing
[2199.88 --> 2201.88]  Holy, holy forever
[2201.88 --> 2202.88]  You will always sing
[2202.88 --> 2203.88]  Holy, holy forever
[2203.88 --> 2204.88]  You will always sing
[2204.88 --> 2209.88]  Holy, holy forever
[2209.88 --> 2211.88]  You will always sing
[2211.88 --> 2213.88]  Worthy is the man
[2213.88 --> 2214.88]  Worthy is the man
[2214.88 --> 2215.88]  Man who once sang
[2215.88 --> 2216.88]  Holy, holy is He
[2216.88 --> 2217.88]  Holy, holy is He
[2217.88 --> 2219.88]  Holy, holy is He
[2219.88 --> 2222.88]  Sing a new song
[2222.88 --> 2223.88]  To Him who sins on
[2223.88 --> 2226.88]  Sing a new song
[2226.88 --> 2228.88]  Sing a new song
[2228.88 --> 2230.88]  To Him who sins on
[2230.88 --> 2233.88]  Heavens first and seen
[2233.88 --> 2234.88]  Holy, holy else
[2234.88 --> 2238.88]  Sing a new song
[2238.88 --> 2243.88]  To Him who sins on
[2243.88 --> 2245.88]  Heaven who sins on
[2245.88 --> 2248.88]  Heaven who sins on
[2248.88 --> 2249.88]  Holy, holy is He
[2249.88 --> 2251.88]  Oh
[2279.88 --> 2281.88]  Oh
[2309.88 --> 2311.88]  Oh
[2340.88 --> 2342.88]  Oh
[2344.88 --> 2346.88]  I
[2346.88 --> 2364.50]  Filled with wonder, awestruck wonder
[2364.50 --> 2370.98]  At the mention of your name
[2370.98 --> 2376.86]  Filled with wonder, awestruck wonder
[2376.86 --> 2383.52]  At the mention of your name
[2383.52 --> 2386.66]  Jesus, your name is power
[2386.66 --> 2389.62]  And we live in wonder
[2389.62 --> 2392.50]  Struck your heart with mystery
[2392.50 --> 2398.60]  Holy, holy, holy
[2398.60 --> 2401.44]  It's the Lord God Almighty
[2401.44 --> 2406.10]  Love for gifts, gifts to come
[2406.10 --> 2411.02]  All creation I see
[2411.02 --> 2413.66]  Great to the King of Me
[2413.66 --> 2416.20]  You are my everything
[2416.20 --> 2419.94]  I live and for you
[2419.94 --> 2445.30]  We have an opportunity now to hear a testimony from someone in our church. I'm going to invite up Isaac Hogewoning to the front here.
[2445.30 --> 2449.46]  Isaac is a grade 10 student in our church
[2449.46 --> 2452.18]  He's been coming to youth since he was able to
[2452.18 --> 2453.68]  You can come right on up there, man
[2453.68 --> 2456.70]  And he had quite the summer that he wants to share with you
[2456.70 --> 2458.18]  So I'm just going to pray for him quick
[2458.18 --> 2460.22]  And then he's going to share with us that
[2460.22 --> 2462.36]  God, I just lift up Isaac to you right now
[2462.36 --> 2464.24]  God, I thank you that he is up here
[2464.24 --> 2466.80]  And willing to share what it is you are doing in his life
[2466.80 --> 2468.52]  And I pray God that as he speaks
[2468.52 --> 2470.24]  You will have us have ears to listen
[2470.24 --> 2471.94]  What you are doing in his life
[2471.94 --> 2474.80]  And God, may we be encouraged and convicted even
[2474.80 --> 2478.28]  To live for you through Isaac's story today
[2478.28 --> 2479.80]  We lift this up to you in your name
[2479.80 --> 2480.30]  Amen
[2480.30 --> 2493.78]  I was raised in a Christian home
[2493.78 --> 2495.38]  And had to go to a church
[2495.38 --> 2497.58]  My Christianity was never my own
[2497.58 --> 2502.56]  August 6th to 17th were some of the most life-changing things in my life
[2502.56 --> 2505.22]  I went to a youth camp called Rev Camp
[2505.22 --> 2506.98]  Which is led by the CLA Church
[2506.98 --> 2509.52]  Going into it, I was a dual citizen
[2509.52 --> 2513.20]  I could be on fire for God one second
[2513.20 --> 2515.84]  The next, I could be blending in with the crowd
[2515.84 --> 2517.56]  And not acknowledge God was there
[2517.56 --> 2519.26]  I called myself a Christian
[2519.26 --> 2521.32]  But I never fully lived like one
[2521.32 --> 2523.28]  I was able to talk the talk
[2523.28 --> 2524.42]  But never walk the walk
[2524.42 --> 2528.18]  I was always thinking that I was able to do things by myself
[2528.18 --> 2530.80]  I got to a really low point in my life
[2530.80 --> 2534.26]  I had so much anger and frustration just bubbling up from sadness
[2534.26 --> 2535.64]  That I was pushed over
[2535.64 --> 2538.42]  Then I was pushed overboard when my friend passed away
[2538.42 --> 2541.68]  Those were some of the hardest weeks of my life
[2541.68 --> 2544.34]  I wasn't able to be in my English class
[2544.34 --> 2545.30]  Because I kept crying
[2545.30 --> 2547.48]  Of the thought of him not going to be there
[2547.48 --> 2549.20]  It brought up so many things
[2549.20 --> 2550.54]  Like when my oma passed away
[2550.54 --> 2552.20]  And now it's kind of coming back
[2552.20 --> 2553.74]  Now that my grandma passed away too
[2553.74 --> 2556.74]  I started questioning the meaning of life
[2556.74 --> 2558.34]  And why I was put through all this
[2558.34 --> 2559.96]  And I blamed God for everything
[2559.96 --> 2562.38]  And purposely went away from him
[2562.38 --> 2563.30]  Because of my anger
[2563.30 --> 2565.82]  But that all changed within two weeks
[2565.82 --> 2567.46]  The first week of camp
[2567.46 --> 2569.78]  I was volunteering as a cabin and tribe leader
[2569.78 --> 2571.88]  I had the privilege to listen, watch
[2571.88 --> 2575.48]  And be a part of so many middle school children's lives being changed
[2575.48 --> 2578.34]  I felt the Holy Spirit moving through them
[2578.34 --> 2579.12]  All of them
[2579.12 --> 2581.12]  These kids that I was leading
[2581.12 --> 2583.18]  Were so hungry to know God
[2583.18 --> 2584.22]  Then it hit me
[2584.22 --> 2586.24]  A big gust of overwhelming love
[2586.24 --> 2587.80]  That just put me into tears
[2587.80 --> 2590.70]  And I verbally heard God speaking to me
[2590.70 --> 2593.90]  That he wants me to lead and be a role model to others
[2593.90 --> 2595.80]  Not just to like younger kids
[2595.80 --> 2596.86]  But to adults
[2596.86 --> 2598.86]  And kids my age too
[2598.86 --> 2601.24]  It's amazing to see how God can work
[2601.24 --> 2603.10]  Through kids to get his work done
[2603.10 --> 2605.42]  It's absolutely beautiful to see these kids
[2605.42 --> 2606.66]  Want God so badly
[2606.66 --> 2608.38]  And man was an experience
[2608.38 --> 2611.32]  I had the privilege to hear some kids share
[2611.32 --> 2613.16]  What they're feeling
[2613.16 --> 2615.76]  And I just got to pray over them
[2615.76 --> 2618.02]  Those kids experienced so much
[2618.02 --> 2619.76]  And were pouring out their hearts for him
[2619.76 --> 2621.88]  I've never seen something like that before
[2621.88 --> 2623.44]  And I just thought to myself
[2623.44 --> 2627.34]  These kids are like grade 6, grade 7, and grade 8
[2627.34 --> 2629.58]  On their knees crying and praying to God
[2629.58 --> 2632.12]  So what's holding me back from doing the same?
[2632.12 --> 2633.72]  A couple days go by
[2633.72 --> 2635.44]  And it's my turn to go as a camper
[2635.44 --> 2637.62]  It was a whole sequence of events
[2637.62 --> 2638.58]  That connected
[2638.58 --> 2639.90]  On the first day
[2639.90 --> 2641.12]  God gave me a word
[2641.12 --> 2642.28]  And that word was beautiful
[2642.28 --> 2643.76]  I was confused
[2643.76 --> 2645.24]  Because I didn't fully understand
[2645.24 --> 2646.04]  What that meant
[2646.04 --> 2647.30]  And I didn't share it
[2647.30 --> 2648.86]  Because I didn't even know what it meant
[2648.86 --> 2650.14]  So I was scared to see
[2650.14 --> 2651.36]  How other people would respond
[2651.36 --> 2652.76]  The second day
[2652.76 --> 2654.80]  God gave me a vision of my friends
[2654.80 --> 2656.38]  At the front of a chapel like this
[2656.38 --> 2659.68]  Looking at all the people
[2659.68 --> 2661.48]  God has saved through them
[2661.48 --> 2663.32]  That night was a night
[2663.32 --> 2664.26]  Where we got to share
[2664.26 --> 2666.00]  What we've been hearing about God
[2666.00 --> 2667.58]  God gave me another word
[2667.58 --> 2668.18]  Love
[2668.18 --> 2670.66]  I went up and shared that
[2670.66 --> 2672.32]  In front of around 200 people
[2672.32 --> 2674.68]  That he just gave me the word love
[2674.68 --> 2677.00]  And that some people were called into ministry
[2677.00 --> 2678.02]  After that
[2678.02 --> 2679.74]  A couple of people came up to me
[2679.74 --> 2682.66]  And said they felt touched by God
[2682.66 --> 2683.90]  After I shared that
[2683.90 --> 2685.74]  This gave me a confidence booster
[2685.74 --> 2688.72]  And let me be able to think more confidently
[2688.72 --> 2690.30]  About God working in my life
[2690.30 --> 2691.90]  On the third day
[2691.90 --> 2693.24]  I prayed for people
[2693.24 --> 2694.96]  And kept receiving that word beautiful
[2694.96 --> 2695.88]  In those prayers
[2695.88 --> 2697.54]  I was praying to myself
[2697.54 --> 2698.90]  And felt the call
[2698.90 --> 2701.16]  To ministry and leadership
[2701.16 --> 2703.72]  I prayed with my youth leader Owen
[2703.72 --> 2706.04]  And he confirmed that God called me
[2706.04 --> 2706.86]  Into ministry
[2706.86 --> 2707.60]  When he said
[2707.60 --> 2709.24]  God has a great plan for you
[2709.24 --> 2710.34]  I know it
[2710.34 --> 2711.24]  And I see it
[2711.24 --> 2714.18]  You're going to be such a strong leader
[2714.18 --> 2714.88]  In your faith
[2714.88 --> 2716.12]  When I heard that
[2716.12 --> 2717.60]  I knew it was from God
[2717.60 --> 2718.70]  The fourth night
[2718.70 --> 2719.60]  Was a prayer night
[2719.60 --> 2721.78]  And I listened 90% of the time
[2721.78 --> 2722.68]  And to be honest
[2722.68 --> 2723.10]  That night
[2723.10 --> 2724.48]  I didn't feel God's presence
[2724.48 --> 2726.18]  And I just felt empty
[2726.18 --> 2728.04]  The fifth day
[2728.04 --> 2728.82]  Was a day
[2728.82 --> 2730.02]  Everything connected
[2730.02 --> 2730.92]  It was like
[2730.92 --> 2732.90]  Someone laid the big puzzle piece down
[2732.90 --> 2733.78]  To complete it
[2733.78 --> 2736.18]  I heard the word beautiful again
[2736.18 --> 2738.44]  That night
[2738.44 --> 2739.16]  Was
[2739.16 --> 2741.14]  We were talking about spiritual gifts
[2741.14 --> 2741.94]  Interpretation
[2741.94 --> 2742.40]  Visions
[2742.40 --> 2743.70]  And speaking in tongues
[2743.70 --> 2744.90]  When the speaker
[2744.90 --> 2745.66]  Was speaking
[2745.66 --> 2747.16]  About tongues
[2747.16 --> 2748.58]  I was just sitting to myself
[2748.58 --> 2749.28]  With my friends
[2749.28 --> 2750.54]  When a couple of like
[2750.54 --> 2751.14]  Random words
[2751.14 --> 2751.76]  Just came in my
[2751.76 --> 2752.40]  My head
[2752.40 --> 2753.38]  And it just seemed like
[2753.38 --> 2753.74]  Gibberish
[2753.74 --> 2754.14]  And like
[2754.14 --> 2755.20]  Silly thoughts
[2755.20 --> 2756.06]  That I think about
[2756.06 --> 2757.18]  And then
[2757.18 --> 2758.48]  I went to a leader
[2758.48 --> 2759.86]  And he prayed over me
[2759.86 --> 2760.80]  And a sentence
[2760.80 --> 2762.00]  Then formed in my head
[2762.00 --> 2763.70]  And it started making more sense
[2763.70 --> 2764.82]  The more and more
[2764.82 --> 2766.30]  People prayed over me
[2766.30 --> 2768.38]  The more it started making sense
[2768.38 --> 2769.30]  Then I went to pray
[2769.30 --> 2770.50]  With my friend Chase
[2770.50 --> 2771.62]  And the Holy Spirit
[2771.62 --> 2772.48]  Came over me
[2772.48 --> 2774.56]  And I just started crying
[2774.56 --> 2775.76]  And praying in tongues
[2775.76 --> 2777.00]  The word beautiful
[2777.00 --> 2777.76]  Came up again
[2777.76 --> 2779.10]  I broke down in tears
[2779.10 --> 2780.24]  I surrendered myself
[2780.24 --> 2781.14]  To him that night
[2781.14 --> 2782.20]  After this
[2782.20 --> 2783.12]  I could understand
[2783.12 --> 2784.20]  More things in my life
[2784.20 --> 2785.64]  I was able to pray
[2785.64 --> 2786.52]  Without thoughts
[2786.52 --> 2787.16]  In my mind
[2787.16 --> 2789.10]  God was able to use me
[2789.10 --> 2789.72]  To pray
[2789.72 --> 2791.74]  For and over others
[2791.74 --> 2793.24]  I was able to see
[2793.24 --> 2794.50]  My friend Matthew's
[2794.50 --> 2795.98]  Passing as a growing moment
[2795.98 --> 2797.34]  And I miss him a lot
[2797.34 --> 2798.02]  But
[2798.02 --> 2799.80]  I can now see that
[2799.80 --> 2800.50]  Whenever I like
[2800.50 --> 2800.94]  Give
[2800.94 --> 2802.30]  Or like share in life
[2802.30 --> 2803.02]  I feel like
[2803.02 --> 2804.62]  He's like right beside me
[2804.62 --> 2805.70]  During that
[2805.70 --> 2806.40]  And uh
[2806.40 --> 2806.92]  Yeah
[2806.92 --> 2808.64]  It makes it a lot easier
[2808.64 --> 2810.02]  Um
[2810.02 --> 2813.40]  But I find joy in that now
[2813.40 --> 2814.40]  And
[2814.40 --> 2814.86]  Yeah
[2814.86 --> 2815.66]  I miss him a lot
[2815.66 --> 2816.02]  But
[2816.02 --> 2818.24]  I can find joy through it
[2818.24 --> 2818.96]  And it's
[2818.96 --> 2820.22]  It's not happiness
[2820.22 --> 2821.60]  Joy to me means
[2821.60 --> 2822.64]  Great pleasure
[2822.64 --> 2822.96]  And like
[2822.96 --> 2823.40]  Heavenly
[2823.40 --> 2824.48]  Happiness
[2824.48 --> 2826.14]  I find joy
[2826.14 --> 2827.34]  Through the heavenly things
[2827.34 --> 2828.40]  When happiness
[2828.40 --> 2829.58]  Is more of an emotion
[2829.58 --> 2830.24]  Of the world
[2830.24 --> 2831.96]  I love these weeks
[2831.96 --> 2832.60]  So much
[2832.60 --> 2833.66]  But I was scared
[2833.66 --> 2834.16]  To leave
[2834.16 --> 2835.98]  I was scared to be back
[2835.98 --> 2836.82]  In everyday life
[2836.82 --> 2837.36]  And slowly
[2837.36 --> 2838.46]  Stray back
[2838.46 --> 2839.10]  To the ways
[2839.10 --> 2839.98]  Of the world
[2839.98 --> 2841.04]  But this time
[2841.04 --> 2842.22]  I knew it was different
[2842.22 --> 2843.80]  I came back
[2843.80 --> 2844.82]  And wanted to be
[2844.82 --> 2845.64]  A holding offering
[2845.64 --> 2846.30]  To God
[2846.30 --> 2848.30]  I started reading my Bible
[2848.30 --> 2849.04]  And doing plans
[2849.04 --> 2849.66]  With my friends
[2849.66 --> 2851.30]  I can smile with joy
[2851.30 --> 2852.08]  Through the times
[2852.08 --> 2852.96]  Of hardship
[2852.96 --> 2854.94]  And my plan
[2854.94 --> 2855.86]  For my future
[2855.86 --> 2856.98]  Was so weak
[2856.98 --> 2857.86]  But once I gave it
[2857.86 --> 2858.30]  To God
[2858.30 --> 2858.92]  His plan
[2858.92 --> 2860.24]  Was so strong
[2860.24 --> 2861.06]  That no one
[2861.06 --> 2862.06]  Can understand it
[2862.06 --> 2862.84]  But him
[2862.84 --> 2864.48]  Romans 8-11
[2864.48 --> 2865.26]  Says
[2865.26 --> 2866.32]  The spirit of God
[2866.32 --> 2867.48]  Who raised Jesus
[2867.48 --> 2868.12]  From the dead
[2868.12 --> 2868.82]  Lives in you
[2868.82 --> 2870.10]  And just as God
[2870.10 --> 2870.68]  Raised Christ
[2870.68 --> 2871.24]  From the dead
[2871.24 --> 2872.40]  He will give life
[2872.40 --> 2872.84]  To you
[2872.84 --> 2874.14]  Your mortal bodies
[2874.14 --> 2875.50]  By the same spirit
[2875.50 --> 2876.40]  Living within you
[2876.40 --> 2877.24]  And like
[2877.24 --> 2878.08]  I love this verse
[2878.08 --> 2879.04]  When I was reading it
[2879.04 --> 2880.02]  I like
[2880.02 --> 2880.84]  Had to read it
[2880.84 --> 2881.50]  Three times
[2881.50 --> 2882.12]  And then I went
[2882.12 --> 2882.86]  Into ESV
[2882.86 --> 2884.14]  And I had to read it again
[2884.14 --> 2884.56]  Because it just
[2884.56 --> 2885.34]  Hit me so hard
[2885.34 --> 2886.34]  And it's so cool
[2886.34 --> 2887.96]  Just to think that
[2887.96 --> 2889.98]  The same Holy Spirit
[2889.98 --> 2890.86]  That left Jesus
[2890.86 --> 2892.10]  Out from the grave
[2892.10 --> 2893.34]  Is living in us
[2893.34 --> 2895.12]  To the day to day life
[2895.12 --> 2896.04]  And like
[2896.04 --> 2896.60]  This was like
[2896.60 --> 2897.42]  Another big boost
[2897.42 --> 2897.94]  Of confidence
[2897.94 --> 2899.16]  Just to like
[2899.16 --> 2899.72]  Go out
[2899.72 --> 2901.28]  And share God's goodness
[2901.28 --> 2903.70]  Something that has
[2903.70 --> 2904.28]  Always been hard
[2904.28 --> 2904.64]  For me
[2904.64 --> 2905.38]  To learn
[2905.38 --> 2906.30]  Is that
[2906.30 --> 2907.54]  God never left us
[2907.54 --> 2908.62]  He was never
[2908.62 --> 2909.96]  Not present in our lives
[2909.96 --> 2911.72]  When it feels like
[2911.72 --> 2912.68]  He's not there
[2912.68 --> 2913.74]  I had to know
[2913.74 --> 2914.12]  That
[2914.12 --> 2915.30]  I had to know
[2915.30 --> 2916.06]  Here and here
[2916.06 --> 2916.42]  That
[2916.42 --> 2918.26]  He's still with me
[2918.26 --> 2919.78]  I gave God
[2919.78 --> 2920.58]  A million reasons
[2920.58 --> 2921.80]  Not to love me
[2921.80 --> 2922.24]  And he still
[2922.24 --> 2922.80]  Find a way
[2922.80 --> 2923.90]  To reach out to me
[2923.90 --> 2926.40]  Another thing
[2926.40 --> 2927.58]  That goes along
[2927.58 --> 2927.96]  With that
[2927.96 --> 2928.36]  Was
[2928.36 --> 2929.84]  I was listening
[2929.84 --> 2930.42]  In the chapel
[2930.42 --> 2930.78]  And
[2930.78 --> 2932.26]  It was
[2932.26 --> 2933.34]  The speaker
[2933.34 --> 2933.92]  Was saying
[2933.92 --> 2934.86]  Satan got
[2934.86 --> 2936.02]  Eternal damnation
[2936.02 --> 2937.22]  For pride
[2937.22 --> 2937.66]  And he
[2937.66 --> 2938.88]  Went putting himself
[2938.88 --> 2940.08]  In the place of God
[2940.08 --> 2940.90]  And what I really
[2940.90 --> 2941.80]  Needed to realize
[2941.80 --> 2942.86]  Was for God
[2942.86 --> 2943.50]  To be put on
[2943.50 --> 2944.34]  My throne
[2944.34 --> 2946.02]  I realized that
[2946.02 --> 2946.80]  Any trophy
[2946.80 --> 2947.56]  In this world
[2947.56 --> 2948.26]  Looks nice
[2948.26 --> 2949.20]  And it's a good
[2949.20 --> 2950.12]  Temporary thing
[2950.12 --> 2951.26]  But really
[2951.26 --> 2952.84]  Any trophy of heaven
[2952.84 --> 2953.42]  Is way
[2953.42 --> 2954.12]  Way better
[2954.12 --> 2955.64]  It really hit me
[2955.64 --> 2956.58]  When C.S. Lewis
[2956.58 --> 2957.28]  Said
[2957.28 --> 2958.54]  My prayer is
[2958.54 --> 2960.42]  My prayer is
[2960.42 --> 2961.88]  That when I die
[2961.88 --> 2962.54]  All of hell
[2962.54 --> 2963.04]  Rejoices
[2963.04 --> 2964.04]  That I'm out to fight
[2964.04 --> 2965.44]  I love that
[2965.44 --> 2966.20]  Because it's crazy
[2966.20 --> 2966.84]  To see how
[2966.84 --> 2967.62]  Scared like
[2967.62 --> 2968.48]  The devil is
[2968.48 --> 2969.00]  From us
[2969.00 --> 2970.04]  To grow closer
[2970.04 --> 2971.06]  In a relationship
[2971.06 --> 2971.68]  With God
[2971.68 --> 2973.14]  And that always
[2973.14 --> 2973.76]  Just keeps
[2973.76 --> 2974.44]  Keeps me
[2974.44 --> 2975.46]  Wanting to get
[2975.46 --> 2976.28]  Closer and closer
[2976.28 --> 2976.88]  With God
[2976.88 --> 2981.24]  How I see
[2981.24 --> 2982.00]  It
[2982.00 --> 2982.60]  Another way
[2982.60 --> 2983.20]  For me to see
[2983.20 --> 2983.60]  It is
[2983.60 --> 2984.30]  Like basketball
[2984.30 --> 2985.36]  Terms
[2985.36 --> 2985.72]  Is
[2985.72 --> 2986.58]  Before
[2986.58 --> 2987.36]  I was
[2987.36 --> 2988.02]  Like a reserve
[2988.02 --> 2988.66]  On the team
[2988.66 --> 2990.02]  To making the bench
[2990.02 --> 2991.64]  Being the sixth man
[2991.64 --> 2992.74]  And now I'm starting
[2992.74 --> 2994.02]  To be in full rotation
[2994.02 --> 2995.86]  And yeah
[2995.86 --> 2997.10]  I really like that
[2997.10 --> 2997.66]  Because it
[2997.66 --> 2998.60]  Helps me
[2998.60 --> 2999.22]  See it
[2999.22 --> 2999.92]  Way easier
[2999.92 --> 3000.96]  Because I'm a basketball guy
[3000.96 --> 3002.20]  So it helps me
[3002.20 --> 3003.26]  Like a physical
[3003.26 --> 3003.88]  Thing
[3003.88 --> 3004.70]  To see
[3004.70 --> 3006.00]  And now I just
[3006.00 --> 3006.70]  Always starting
[3006.70 --> 3007.30]  To get better
[3007.30 --> 3008.88]  I pray now
[3008.88 --> 3009.86]  That I will be
[3009.86 --> 3010.54]  A dual citizen
[3010.54 --> 3011.04]  Still
[3011.04 --> 3012.16]  But not to flip
[3012.16 --> 3012.46]  Flop
[3012.46 --> 3013.18]  Between
[3013.18 --> 3014.04]  The things
[3014.04 --> 3014.50]  Of the world
[3014.50 --> 3015.26]  And God
[3015.26 --> 3016.62]  But that I'm here
[3016.62 --> 3017.56]  On this earth
[3017.56 --> 3018.50]  Not of the world
[3018.50 --> 3019.38]  But on the earth
[3019.38 --> 3020.40]  And a citizen
[3020.40 --> 3021.00]  At heaven
[3021.00 --> 3022.08]  At the same time
[3022.08 --> 3023.26]  I'll follow
[3023.26 --> 3024.32]  Where his spirit
[3024.32 --> 3024.92]  Leads me
[3024.92 --> 3026.18]  Broken as I may be
[3026.18 --> 3027.14]  I will give him
[3027.14 --> 3027.68]  Everything
[3027.68 --> 3029.66]  Philippians 2.13
[3029.66 --> 3030.42]  Says
[3030.42 --> 3031.42]  For God is working
[3031.42 --> 3031.92]  In you
[3031.92 --> 3033.04]  Giving you desire
[3033.04 --> 3033.62]  And the power
[3033.62 --> 3034.52]  To do what
[3034.52 --> 3035.36]  Pleases him
[3035.36 --> 3036.10]  And man
[3036.10 --> 3036.88]  Can I tell you
[3036.88 --> 3038.48]  He sure is working
[3038.48 --> 3039.66]  I am raised
[3039.66 --> 3040.52]  In a Christian home
[3040.52 --> 3041.12]  And I get
[3041.12 --> 3042.20]  To go to church
[3042.20 --> 3043.36]  I have a relationship
[3043.36 --> 3044.10]  With God
[3044.10 --> 3045.40]  Perspective changed
[3045.40 --> 3045.92]  My life
[3045.92 --> 3047.38]  I've never walked alone
[3047.38 --> 3048.48]  And I can lean back
[3048.48 --> 3049.74]  In his loving arms
[3049.74 --> 3051.34]  Of a good father
[3051.34 --> 3052.52]  I gave God
[3052.52 --> 3053.38]  A million reasons
[3053.38 --> 3054.96]  To not love me
[3054.96 --> 3055.52]  And he still
[3055.52 --> 3055.96]  Find a way
[3055.96 --> 3056.60]  To reach out
[3056.60 --> 3058.64]  And he chose me
[3058.64 --> 3060.70]  I didn't find Jesus
[3060.70 --> 3061.88]  Jesus found me
[3061.88 --> 3062.56]  It's all about
[3062.56 --> 3063.26]  My perspective
[3063.26 --> 3063.90]  That changed
[3063.90 --> 3065.28]  I felt the big change
[3065.28 --> 3065.80]  When I started
[3065.80 --> 3066.46]  Living out
[3066.46 --> 3067.58]  Being a Christian
[3067.58 --> 3068.40]  Not using it
[3068.40 --> 3069.02]  As a title
[3069.02 --> 3070.34]  I used my Christianity
[3070.34 --> 3071.16]  For a title
[3071.16 --> 3073.08]  For a very long time
[3073.08 --> 3074.36]  And I went through
[3074.36 --> 3074.88]  The motions
[3074.88 --> 3076.36]  Of being that good kid
[3076.36 --> 3077.92]  I followed Jesus
[3077.92 --> 3079.70]  And we got a good
[3079.70 --> 3080.56]  Strong relationship
[3080.56 --> 3081.76]  Happening between us
[3081.76 --> 3083.38]  It's not what we do
[3083.38 --> 3084.44]  For him that matters
[3084.44 --> 3085.38]  It's what he's
[3085.38 --> 3086.68]  Done for us
[3086.68 --> 3087.72]  And what he is doing
[3087.72 --> 3088.32]  In us
[3088.32 --> 3101.52]  I'm going to pray
[3101.52 --> 3102.22]  Again for Ike
[3102.22 --> 3103.04]  And then I'm going
[3103.04 --> 3103.50]  To invite the worship
[3103.50 --> 3103.94]  Team forward
[3103.94 --> 3104.34]  We're going to sing
[3104.34 --> 3104.66]  A song
[3104.66 --> 3106.28]  God I thank you
[3106.28 --> 3107.04]  So much for what
[3107.04 --> 3107.90]  You're doing in Isaac's
[3107.90 --> 3108.60]  Life and I thank you
[3108.60 --> 3109.26]  For the spirit
[3109.26 --> 3110.30]  That is moving in him
[3110.30 --> 3110.58]  God
[3110.58 --> 3111.80]  As he is feeling
[3111.80 --> 3112.98]  Called into leadership
[3112.98 --> 3114.00]  Called into ministry
[3114.00 --> 3114.74]  And called just to
[3114.74 --> 3115.52]  Serve you in his
[3115.52 --> 3116.02]  Every day
[3116.02 --> 3117.52]  We pray that your spirit
[3117.52 --> 3118.52]  Always be in him
[3118.52 --> 3119.64]  As you promised it to be
[3119.64 --> 3120.48]  And may he continue
[3120.48 --> 3121.62]  To seek you first
[3121.62 --> 3122.32]  In all things
[3122.32 --> 3123.92]  Thank you for his joy
[3123.92 --> 3124.62]  For his heart
[3124.62 --> 3125.32]  For his willingness
[3125.32 --> 3126.54]  To share this story
[3126.54 --> 3127.74]  God we pray that
[3127.74 --> 3128.62]  All of us can leave
[3128.62 --> 3129.00]  Here today
[3129.00 --> 3129.92]  Just so encouraged
[3129.92 --> 3130.64]  By what you're doing
[3130.64 --> 3131.28]  In his life
[3131.28 --> 3132.88]  And Lord
[3132.88 --> 3133.38]  What you're doing
[3133.38 --> 3134.52]  In our lives as well
[3134.52 --> 3136.08]  May we share our stories
[3136.08 --> 3136.94]  With each other
[3136.94 --> 3138.30]  So that we can just be
[3138.30 --> 3140.86]  So we can be encouraged
[3140.86 --> 3141.94]  In our walk of faith
[3141.94 --> 3143.28]  God thank you for Isaac
[3143.28 --> 3144.30]  Continue to walk
[3144.30 --> 3145.08]  Alongside him
[3145.08 --> 3146.58]  And we pray a blessing
[3146.58 --> 3147.54]  Over him in your name
[3147.54 --> 3148.06]  Amen
[3148.06 --> 3152.40]  Am I on?
[3152.94 --> 3154.10]  Does that not want
[3154.10 --> 3155.26]  That will make you want
[3155.26 --> 3156.48]  To praise God?
[3156.78 --> 3157.80]  Let's stand and worship
[3157.80 --> 3176.30]  We are the moment
[3176.30 --> 3179.64]  You are forever
[3179.64 --> 3183.48]  Lord of the ages
[3183.48 --> 3185.80]  God before time
[3185.80 --> 3189.68]  We are a faithful
[3189.68 --> 3193.04]  You are eternal
[3193.04 --> 3195.80]  Love everlasting
[3195.80 --> 3200.80]  Reigning on high
[3200.80 --> 3206.80]  Holy, holy, Lord God Almighty
[3206.80 --> 3214.18]  Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
[3214.18 --> 3219.08]  I will pray to the earth
[3219.08 --> 3224.80]  Be unto your name
[3224.80 --> 3230.80]  Be unto your name
[3230.80 --> 3239.98]  We are the broken
[3239.98 --> 3242.80]  You are the healer
[3242.80 --> 3245.80]  Jesus Redeemer
[3245.80 --> 3248.80]  Mighty you save
[3248.80 --> 3253.04]  You are the love song
[3253.04 --> 3255.80]  We'll sing forever
[3255.80 --> 3257.04]  Now lieber
[3257.04 --> 3257.12]  Bow in before you
[3257.12 --> 3257.70]  Vowing him
[3257.70 --> 3259.76]  Beloved him
[3259.76 --> 3260.42]  Whenever you are the third
[3260.42 --> 3261.82]  Blessed your name
[3261.82 --> 3262.88]  Amen
[3262.88 --> 3265.68]  Lord for all
[3265.68 --> 3266.26]  Holy, holy
[3266.26 --> 3267.22]  Lord God almighty
[3267.22 --> 3269.00]  You are the holy
[3269.00 --> 3269.80]  Human
[3269.80 --> 3270.26]  Baby you are the тр Ќle blood
[3270.26 --> 3270.92]  Thank you, Steve and what得
[3270.92 --> 3271.36]  You are thecuaro
[3271.36 --> 3276.18]  He is the last word once saved
[3276.18 --> 3282.50]  Highest praises on earth and lowly
[3282.50 --> 3287.20]  Be unto your name
[3287.20 --> 3294.18]  Be unto your name
[3294.18 --> 3299.78]  Holy, holy Lord God almighty
[3299.78 --> 3306.46]  Worthy is the last word once saved
[3306.46 --> 3312.86]  Highest praises on earth and lowly
[3312.86 --> 3318.46]  Be unto your name
[3318.46 --> 3324.66]  Be unto your name
[3324.66 --> 3330.34]  Be unto your name
[3330.34 --> 3332.84]  Invite you to be seated
[3332.84 --> 3349.66]  Good morning, my name is Mike and I am a deacon here at the church
[3349.66 --> 3355.96]  And we have an opportunity now to respond and give back financially in response to what God has done for us
[3355.96 --> 3363.40]  So this morning we're going to collect a offering for the Campus Reformed Ministries
[3363.40 --> 3367.10]  Which is formerly known as the UBCO Chaplaincy
[3367.10 --> 3370.80]  I think our church has been supporting this ministry for many years
[3370.80 --> 3373.56]  And it is run by Todd Statham
[3373.56 --> 3375.50]  And actually more recently Curtis
[3375.50 --> 3376.72]  Met left
[3376.72 --> 3377.74]  I can never say
[3377.74 --> 3379.94]  Melista
[3379.94 --> 3380.64]  Oh yeah
[3380.64 --> 3384.00]  Known the guy for years and I can still not say his last name
[3384.00 --> 3387.08]  Anyway, he formerly he was working at Willoughby
[3387.08 --> 3389.46]  He has actually moved up there and he's also part of it now too
[3389.46 --> 3390.24]  So
[3390.24 --> 3397.32]  Todd and Curtis and other ministry leaders get involved in leading discussion groups, prayer groups
[3397.32 --> 3406.92]  And sort of meeting a lot of students where they're at in their day-to-day in in usually a time of exploration and figuring out faith and figuring out life
[3406.92 --> 3412.26]  So it's a pretty powerful ministry that they run there. So thank you for giving up your gifts this morning
[3412.26 --> 3430.98]  Lord I lift your name all high
[3430.98 --> 3435.86]  Lord I love to sing your praises
[3435.86 --> 3441.86]  I'm so glad you're in my life
[3441.86 --> 3447.46]  I'm so glad you came to save us
[3447.46 --> 3453.56]  You came from heaven to earth to show the way
[3453.56 --> 3459.04]  From the earth to the cross I can't sing
[3459.04 --> 3461.90]  From the cross to the grave
[3461.90 --> 3464.58]  From the grave to the sky
[3464.58 --> 3469.04]  Lord I lift your name all high
[3469.04 --> 3477.94]  Lord I lift your name all high
[3477.94 --> 3481.72]  Lord I love to sing your praises
[3481.72 --> 3483.72]  I'm so glad you're in my life
[3483.72 --> 3488.72]  I'm so glad you came to save us
[3488.72 --> 3493.72]  I'm so glad you came to save us
[3493.72 --> 3499.72]  You came from heaven to earth to show the way
[3499.72 --> 3504.72]  From the earth to the cross I can't sing
[3504.72 --> 3506.72]  I lift your name all high
[3506.72 --> 3507.72]  From the cross to the grave
[3507.72 --> 3511.72]  From the grave to the sky
[3511.72 --> 3515.72]  Lord I lift your name all high
[3515.72 --> 3521.72]  You came from heaven to earth to show the way
[3521.72 --> 3525.72]  From the earth to the cross I can't sing
[3525.72 --> 3540.72]  My name to the grave
[3540.72 --> 3542.72]  From the cross to the grave
[3542.72 --> 3546.72]  From the earth to the cross I can't sing
[3546.72 --> 3558.02]  My name today, from the cross to the grave, from the grave to the sky, Lord, I lift your name on high.
[3560.30 --> 3564.02]  Lord, I lift your name on high.
[3565.96 --> 3569.52]  Lord, I lift your name on high.
[3569.52 --> 3599.50]  Lord, I lift your name on high.
[3599.52 --> 3629.50]  Lord, I lift your name on high.
[3629.50 --> 3659.48]  Lord, I lift your name on high.
[3659.48 --> 3661.40]  That's quite the trip.
[3661.78 --> 3663.10]  How did you manage that?
[3663.64 --> 3667.38]  Turns out when you follow someone, you go where they go.
[3667.90 --> 3670.76]  Oh, well, that's just that simple, isn't it?
[3671.44 --> 3674.06]  Do you know what we're going to talk about today in Children's Worship Time?
[3674.62 --> 3675.86]  Who do we follow?
[3675.86 --> 3679.14]  Yeah.
[3680.56 --> 3683.54]  I don't know. I followed the guy with the stick.
[3684.00 --> 3687.18]  Yeah. And where did that get you? Stuck in a suitcase.
[3689.60 --> 3691.90]  So we're going to talk about who we should be
[3691.90 --> 3694.64]  following today in children's worship time. Does that sound fun?
[3695.00 --> 3699.84]  Does that sound good, kids? Yeah? Okay. I'm going to pray and then we're going to do the Lord's blessing
[3699.84 --> 3703.48]  and then we'll head off to children's worship time, okay? Sounds good. Alright, let's pray.
[3703.48 --> 3707.84]  Dear God, thank you so much for this day. Thank you that we could be in church this morning,
[3708.08 --> 3711.56]  that we could already hear stories about how you're moving in people's life and how
[3711.56 --> 3715.58]  when we follow you, you do wonderful things. God, we pray that you will be
[3715.58 --> 3719.64]  with us as we learn that. Be with the adults who are staying back here. Be with
[3719.64 --> 3723.48]  Reverend Dr. Ed Gerber too as he shares your word. May we all learn
[3723.48 --> 3727.56]  how it is that we should be following you every day. We pray this in your name.
[3727.92 --> 3729.44]  Amen. Say bye to Hank.
[3729.44 --> 3734.48]  Bye. Bye, kids. Now stand up. Let's do the Lord's blessing together, okay?
[3735.48 --> 3739.26]  Here we go. Hands out. And we'll say together one, two, three.
[3739.26 --> 3742.08]  The Lord be with you.
[3742.08 --> 3744.08]  And also with you.
[3744.08 --> 3745.48]  Amen.
[3745.48 --> 3746.08]  Amen.
[3746.08 --> 3747.08]  Amen.
[3747.08 --> 3748.08]  Amen.
[3748.08 --> 3749.08]  Amen.
[3749.08 --> 3750.08]  Amen.
[3750.08 --> 3751.08]  Amen.
[3751.08 --> 3752.08]  Amen.
[3752.08 --> 3753.08]  Amen.
[3753.08 --> 3754.08]  Amen.
[3754.08 --> 3755.08]  Amen.
[3755.08 --> 3756.08]  Amen.
[3756.08 --> 3757.08]  Amen.
[3757.08 --> 3758.08]  Amen.
[3758.08 --> 3759.08]  Amen.
[3759.08 --> 3759.42]  Amen.
[3759.44 --> 3770.02]  Good.
[3770.02 --> 3772.06]  He left it on.
[3772.06 --> 3774.80]  Good. He left it on.
[3774.80 --> 3779.58]  Morning. My name's Dick and I am a child of God, and I am a member here.
[3780.70 --> 3783.54]  And, Isaac, praise God.
[3783.54 --> 3784.84]  Awesome.
[3784.84 --> 3789.04]  I just want to go over some of the stuff that was in the bulletin,
[3789.04 --> 3792.38]  And we are very thankful for Grayson, the birth of Grayson.
[3793.30 --> 3799.58]  He was premature, and we pray for him, his family, his entire family, that things may go well.
[3800.70 --> 3807.54]  Rosavita and others who struggle with health concerns, some we know about, some we don't.
[3809.00 --> 3814.06]  And we would also like to pray for those who are not as mobile as they would like to be.
[3814.06 --> 3823.80]  I just want to mention, and I probably did this years ago already, but I have a niece, and her name is Jana.
[3824.30 --> 3826.56]  And she's going to be 35 years old pretty quick.
[3827.36 --> 3831.38]  And she has never walked a single step in her life.
[3831.86 --> 3838.50]  So if you think you've got issues, and she is one of the happiest people I know, imagine that.
[3838.50 --> 3848.92]  I want to pray for DeWinters, who are traveling today, as they say goodbye to Rachel's grandma.
[3849.96 --> 3856.14]  And I want to pray also for Hoga Warnings, who this past week also said goodbye to a mom and grandma and wife.
[3858.16 --> 3859.36]  And let's pray.
[3859.36 --> 3864.80]  Our Father, Lord, in heaven, Lord, thank you.
[3865.70 --> 3867.46]  Thank you we can be here this morning.
[3867.62 --> 3869.00]  Thank you we can sing your praises.
[3869.58 --> 3870.74]  Thank you we can worship you.
[3870.84 --> 3872.26]  Thank you we can hear testimonies.
[3874.12 --> 3876.38]  Lord, we pray we help and guide each one of us.
[3876.50 --> 3882.30]  Lord, the stuff that's going on in the world, Israel, Ukraine, all these different places, Lord.
[3882.30 --> 3889.76]  Lord, we pray for you to come quickly, because things don't get any better down here.
[3892.74 --> 3896.50]  Lord, and will you give us lists of people to pray for?
[3896.74 --> 3899.58]  Lord, the easiest thing we can do on our own is pray.
[3900.64 --> 3903.16]  Nobody has to see us, nobody has to hear us except you.
[3903.66 --> 3905.02]  We thank you that you do, Lord.
[3905.68 --> 3907.60]  And if we don't have a list, help us to make one.
[3907.60 --> 3912.18]  Lord, lead us and guide us in our walk.
[3912.32 --> 3918.14]  If we go to school, or if we teach, or if we go to work, or if we work in the house, or whatever we do.
[3918.20 --> 3919.40]  Whatever you have called us to do.
[3919.52 --> 3921.72]  Maybe you haven't called us yet, but Lord, please do.
[3922.70 --> 3924.22]  Lord, but we can all have your word.
[3924.32 --> 3929.60]  We can all have your leading hand that you...
[3929.60 --> 3931.98]  And then, Lord, just help us to trust and obey.
[3932.50 --> 3934.34]  It's that simple, but it's not simple, Lord.
[3934.34 --> 3935.36]  We make it so difficult.
[3935.36 --> 3939.50]  Lord, we pray for our ministry here.
[3939.72 --> 3941.22]  We pray for our staff here.
[3941.32 --> 3947.08]  We pray for Chris and Rachel, especially right now, as they go say goodbye to someone who has meant a lot to them.
[3948.32 --> 3954.80]  Lord, we thank you that we could share with Hoga Woonings and their family this week.
[3955.60 --> 3956.92]  Lord, we pray for each one of them.
[3957.06 --> 3957.78]  We pray for Klaus.
[3958.02 --> 3962.54]  Lord, when you've been with somebody for so long, and then all of a sudden you're alone.
[3962.54 --> 3966.08]  Lord, will you help and guide us?
[3966.16 --> 3967.84]  Will you walk with us?
[3967.92 --> 3968.64]  Will you lead us?
[3968.74 --> 3970.70]  Will you take our hand, Lord?
[3970.94 --> 3972.18]  Will you help us to trust you?
[3974.26 --> 3977.10]  Lord, we pray for the wars, rumors of wars.
[3977.54 --> 3983.08]  And we know there will never be an end to them until you come back, Lord.
[3983.18 --> 3984.68]  And then all that stops.
[3986.08 --> 3989.54]  Lord, sometimes we're a little bit nervous thinking about you coming back because are we ready?
[3989.54 --> 3993.40]  Maybe we're having a good time down here.
[3993.52 --> 3994.60]  Maybe we don't want you to come.
[3995.62 --> 3996.26]  Lord, help us.
[3996.34 --> 3996.90]  Change us.
[3999.76 --> 4000.44]  Motivate us.
[4000.96 --> 4001.66]  Convict us.
[4003.28 --> 4007.58]  Lord, as we think about you today, thank you that you always think about us.
[4008.22 --> 4012.28]  Lord, it's incomprehensible how you know each one of us.
[4012.34 --> 4012.98]  You know our name.
[4013.12 --> 4016.14]  You know what we're doing, what we're not doing, what we shouldn't be doing.
[4016.14 --> 4022.58]  Lord, we ask you to be with Dr. Ed this morning as he brings your word.
[4023.72 --> 4024.84]  Lord, may you convict us.
[4024.92 --> 4026.14]  May you convict him.
[4026.30 --> 4029.26]  Will you help lead and guide him?
[4029.36 --> 4031.32]  Lord, thank you that we can be part of Emmanuel.
[4031.54 --> 4032.98]  Thank you that you call us.
[4034.28 --> 4043.06]  Give us the strength and the wisdom and the insight and the drive to share your word when we're able.
[4044.00 --> 4045.50]  Thank you for your love and care, Lord.
[4046.16 --> 4047.18]  Thank you in Jesus' name.
[4047.30 --> 4047.48]  Amen.
[4067.04 --> 4067.78]  Well, good morning.
[4068.82 --> 4070.84]  It's good to see you and it's great to be with you.
[4070.90 --> 4071.90]  A couple of things as I begin.
[4071.90 --> 4075.12]  First of all, please feel free to simply call me Ed.
[4075.90 --> 4076.74]  That's enough.
[4077.32 --> 4082.04]  This Reverend Doctor stuff is great, but Ed is my name and you're free to use it.
[4082.10 --> 4083.34]  Please feel free to use it.
[4084.04 --> 4086.76]  Also, was it Tim who did the offering thing?
[4088.20 --> 4088.92]  Here's Ike.
[4089.16 --> 4089.38]  Sorry.
[4089.94 --> 4090.38]  Mike.
[4090.52 --> 4092.22]  Okay, so we have Mike and Ike, not Tim.
[4092.72 --> 4092.96]  All right.
[4092.96 --> 4096.20]  But here's a helpful way to remember Curtis's last name.
[4097.58 --> 4099.10]  Belief with a st at the end.
[4101.10 --> 4103.00]  It's belief-sta, malief-sta.
[4103.26 --> 4104.28]  So that's one way there.
[4104.74 --> 4108.82]  And then third, I don't know why you needed me here this morning.
[4108.82 --> 4114.14]  I think Ike already brought a very profound, very deep, a very wonderful message.
[4114.60 --> 4115.70]  So thank you for that.
[4116.18 --> 4117.42]  That will stay with us.
[4117.84 --> 4119.66]  And then finally, I'm just noticing the time.
[4120.54 --> 4123.14]  Have I really got six minutes to preach this out?
[4123.14 --> 4129.14]  I think I can do it, but it might not give the kids enough time, so I'll try and expand
[4129.14 --> 4129.76]  a little bit.
[4130.04 --> 4134.30]  And just in that regard, I want to say, are there any Trinity students here who were at
[4134.30 --> 4135.48]  chapel a week and a half ago?
[4137.08 --> 4138.34]  Just one, my own daughter.
[4138.48 --> 4138.92]  Okay, good.
[4138.96 --> 4140.10]  I'm not going to feel too badly.
[4141.30 --> 4145.34]  Because what you're getting this morning, Chris called me on Friday morning and asked me if
[4145.34 --> 4145.90]  I would do this.
[4145.94 --> 4147.10]  I'm like, oh my goodness, I don't know.
[4147.16 --> 4148.08]  That's not a lot of time.
[4148.08 --> 4154.80]  So I am taking what was a seven-minute message in chapel and stretching it out and filling
[4154.80 --> 4156.96]  it out a little bit more for us this morning.
[4157.24 --> 4163.92]  So we at Trinity Western University in our chapel time have been looking at Hebrews chapter
[4163.92 --> 4168.80]  11, which talks about, as you may know, the heroes of the faith.
[4169.36 --> 4173.24]  In chapter 12, those who are called the great cloud of witnesses.
[4173.24 --> 4180.80]  The story behind the figure we're looking at today, who is Abraham, is when after Abraham
[4180.80 --> 4187.54]  and Sarah had been given the gift of the long-awaited poor child, Isaac, God comes to Abraham in
[4187.54 --> 4191.60]  Genesis chapter 22, and he speaks a nightmare.
[4192.50 --> 4195.10]  He speaks a horror to Abraham.
[4195.28 --> 4201.20]  He says, take your son, your only son, the son whom you love, up on Mount Moriah and sacrifice
[4201.20 --> 4202.42]  your only son.
[4202.42 --> 4207.10]  Jewish tradition calls this story the Akedah, and they call it the Akedah because it's called
[4207.10 --> 4208.20]  the binding.
[4208.52 --> 4215.32]  When Abraham goes so far as to lay his son down on the altar, ties him up to sacrifice
[4215.32 --> 4219.32]  him, and then God stops him and brings about a substitute.
[4220.36 --> 4228.70]  So I invite you to hear how the author of Hebrews remembers the nature of Abraham's faith in
[4228.70 --> 4231.42]  this passage and how then we can learn from this as well.
[4231.42 --> 4234.64]  So this is Hebrews 11 verses 17 through 19.
[4234.74 --> 4236.06]  Beloved, listen to God's word.
[4236.06 --> 4242.92]  By faith, Abraham, when God tested him, offered Isaac as a sacrifice.
[4243.92 --> 4249.46]  He who had received the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son, even though
[4249.46 --> 4254.26]  God had said to him, it is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.
[4255.38 --> 4260.88]  Abraham reasoned that God could raise the dead, and figuratively speaking, he did receive
[4260.88 --> 4261.88]  Isaac back from death.
[4261.88 --> 4262.76]  Isaac back from death.
[4262.76 --> 4264.44]  The word of the Lord.
[4264.44 --> 4266.44]  Thanks be to God.
[4266.44 --> 4272.32]  In Psalm 62, 11, the psalmist says this,
[4272.32 --> 4274.90]  One thing God has spoken.
[4274.90 --> 4277.10]  Two things I have heard.
[4278.10 --> 4283.78]  That you, O God, are powerful, and that you, O God, are loving.
[4285.16 --> 4293.62]  When God speaks about his own essential nature, he can put it as simply as two words.
[4293.62 --> 4300.70]  On the one hand, God is powerful, and on the other hand, God is loving.
[4300.86 --> 4304.06]  We might say God is powerful love.
[4304.06 --> 4312.54]  There are times in our lives, aren't there, when the reality of God's power and the reality
[4312.54 --> 4321.50]  of God's love merge in our experience in a single moment in time, crystallize in our experience
[4321.50 --> 4329.02]  in a single moment in time, or put it this way, become real, so real in our experience
[4329.02 --> 4337.74]  in a single moment in time, and the effect is that we taste the goodness of God.
[4340.14 --> 4344.60]  My mom tells the story when she was nine or ten years old, her mother had sent her out of the house
[4344.60 --> 4347.50]  to get out and go do something.
[4348.26 --> 4350.32]  It was a cloud-covered BC day.
[4350.42 --> 4357.28]  It was dark, and my mom was skipping in the front driveway, and she wasn't feeling very good about herself,
[4357.28 --> 4359.02]  wasn't feeling very good about life.
[4359.18 --> 4364.88]  She continued to skip, and as she skipped, suddenly, she stopped because she noticed that the cloud,
[4365.28 --> 4370.30]  a massive cloud, moved to the left, and a massive cloud moved to the right,
[4370.68 --> 4375.80]  and a single opening came in the sky, and as she looked up in the sky, a beam of light,
[4375.92 --> 4379.28]  the sun came into the hole, a beam of light came down on her,
[4379.28 --> 4386.50]  and she experienced in that moment the reality of the power of God, and the reality of the love of God
[4386.50 --> 4394.84]  merge in her experience in a single moment in time, and she was flooded with a sense of the goodness of God.
[4395.40 --> 4401.62]  He who is powerful enough to make that fiery ball of gas shine down her with such warmth
[4401.62 --> 4404.36]  and bathe her in light and warmth.
[4405.16 --> 4406.18]  It's good.
[4406.86 --> 4407.70]  It's so good.
[4408.66 --> 4415.26]  I imagine that Abraham had times like these, times when, indeed, the reality of the power of God
[4415.26 --> 4420.86]  and the reality of the love of God merged or crystallized or became real at a single moment in time
[4420.86 --> 4422.70]  in his experience.
[4422.70 --> 4428.84]  Like, for example, when his nephew Lot was kidnapped, taken off by five kings,
[4429.14 --> 4434.44]  very, very powerful kings, Lot, his wife, his children, all of their possessions taken away.
[4434.96 --> 4438.56]  Abraham embraces courage, and he goes and chases these five kings down.
[4439.50 --> 4442.02]  Can you imagine the scene as he's coming back?
[4442.12 --> 4444.02]  Tears are on Lot and his family's face.
[4444.98 --> 4451.50]  Abraham, with only 300 men, exhibiting the power of God, rescuing his nephew Lot.
[4451.50 --> 4455.08]  And, oh, the love of God, which gave him the strength to do it.
[4456.28 --> 4463.26]  I think of Abraham when he and Sarah, after so long of waiting, after so many years of
[4463.26 --> 4469.06]  disappointment with infertility, riding that roller coaster of despair and hope and hope
[4469.06 --> 4472.76]  and despair every single month, year after year after year, and finally they hold this
[4472.76 --> 4478.48]  little baby when they're in their 90s and 100 years old in their arms and seeing Isaac's
[4478.48 --> 4480.74]  little eyes blinking back at them.
[4481.50 --> 4486.64]  He asked the power of God who can bring life where there is no life, who can bring life
[4486.64 --> 4490.80]  into a barren womb, and the goodness of God who would do such a thing, the love of God.
[4491.74 --> 4494.38]  Indeed, it's the experience of goodness.
[4494.84 --> 4500.88]  I wonder, as you think about it here, can you recall a time and make it real to yourself
[4500.88 --> 4505.68]  when the reality of the power of God on the one hand and the reality of the love of God
[4505.68 --> 4515.62]  and the other merged into one in your experience and gave you a feeling of the incredible, cascading
[4515.62 --> 4518.76]  goodness of God and just how real that goodness is?
[4518.82 --> 4520.16]  Can you recall a time like that?
[4521.76 --> 4523.78]  I encourage you, bring it back into your mind.
[4524.82 --> 4526.02]  Bring it back into your soul.
[4526.02 --> 4527.82]  Let it wash over you for a moment.
[4529.96 --> 4532.34]  Either a time long ago or maybe a time more recently.
[4535.86 --> 4539.42]  One of my recent experiences of this came this summer.
[4539.42 --> 4545.68]  My wife, Michelle, myself, and our four daughters had the extraordinary privilege of going to
[4545.68 --> 4548.24]  the UK for a trip for three weeks.
[4548.78 --> 4553.32]  I had done a PhD on the Isle of Anglesey in the north of Wales, and we had promised our
[4553.32 --> 4560.26]  kids many moons ago at this point, 15 years ago basically, that one day we would come back.
[4560.38 --> 4562.22]  And so Michelle and I had been saving and saving.
[4562.22 --> 4566.52]  We were supposed to go during COVID, couldn't go, but our opportunity came this summer.
[4566.64 --> 4570.30]  So we flew out, landed at Gatwick International Airport in London.
[4570.44 --> 4571.42]  I rented a big bus.
[4571.72 --> 4572.94]  It was like a nine-seater.
[4573.46 --> 4579.92]  We drove from there to the Cotswolds and Bath, and then we went to an adorable little town
[4579.92 --> 4583.22]  called Glandelo and walked around all these little shops.
[4583.38 --> 4588.24]  And then we ended up going to a place called Solva, which is in an area called the Pembroke Shire,
[4588.80 --> 4590.64]  the southwest coast of Wales.
[4590.64 --> 4592.74]  It was stunningly beautiful.
[4593.60 --> 4599.00]  The first full day that we had in Solva, we decided we were going to go for a 7.7-kilometer
[4599.00 --> 4603.94]  walk up north the coast of the Pembroke Shire to a place called St. David's.
[4604.60 --> 4606.18]  And so we got on our shorts.
[4606.32 --> 4607.22]  It was a beautiful day.
[4607.32 --> 4608.24]  The sky was blue.
[4608.34 --> 4609.18]  The sun was out.
[4609.28 --> 4612.84]  The wind was blowing as we were walking on the Pembroke Shire coast.
[4612.94 --> 4614.82]  It wasn't blowing at our faces.
[4614.98 --> 4618.96]  It wasn't blowing from behind, but it was blowing from the side, cooling us on this hot day.
[4618.96 --> 4620.60]  And it was a glorious walk.
[4620.66 --> 4624.54]  And we walked with quite some pace all the way to St. David's, walked another two kilometers
[4624.54 --> 4626.90]  into the town, and we were famished.
[4627.00 --> 4628.18]  We had this delicious pizza.
[4628.32 --> 4629.32]  I'm like, oh, I want to go.
[4629.40 --> 4630.92]  I hear there's a church in St. David's.
[4630.92 --> 4631.76]  Let's go to the church.
[4632.16 --> 4633.82]  We walked down a street, and we turned around.
[4633.92 --> 4634.70]  Of course, it's not a church.
[4634.78 --> 4638.80]  It's a cathedral that's a block long made in the 10th or 11th century.
[4638.92 --> 4644.66]  We're walking around the back, spent an hour just mesmerized with a sense of transcendence
[4644.66 --> 4649.50]  and eminence, all the artwork, the statues, and just marveling at our brothers and sisters
[4649.50 --> 4651.16]  in the faith who put this thing together.
[4652.50 --> 4657.74]  We walked back along the Pembroke Shire, now walking south again, and still the sun was
[4657.74 --> 4658.08]  shining.
[4658.48 --> 4659.14]  It was beautiful.
[4659.14 --> 4663.76]  And I remember at one point, Michelle and I were walking out ahead, and our four daughters,
[4664.34 --> 4669.08]  2018, 16, and 15, were walking behind us.
[4669.64 --> 4670.54]  No phones.
[4671.76 --> 4673.04]  No devices.
[4674.46 --> 4675.02]  Laughter.
[4676.02 --> 4677.16]  Talking with one another.
[4678.92 --> 4680.20]  Everything lined up.
[4681.12 --> 4687.80]  The layers of beauty, the layers of the power of God, the layers of the love of God were all
[4687.80 --> 4692.10]  there, and I was overwhelmed with a sense of the goodness of God.
[4693.38 --> 4697.42]  Because, indeed, the reality of the power of God and the reality of the love of God merged in my
[4697.42 --> 4700.96]  experience in a single moment of time, and it was overwhelming.
[4701.48 --> 4705.84]  The goodness of God was so real in that moment, and we can have moments like that, right?
[4706.62 --> 4707.76]  Oh, and they're precious.
[4708.52 --> 4709.32]  They're so good.
[4710.24 --> 4712.10]  But then we can have other moments as well.
[4712.10 --> 4719.64]  We can have moments like Abraham surely had when God came to him and said, take your son,
[4719.72 --> 4723.22]  your only son, the son whom you love, and sacrifice him.
[4723.38 --> 4729.50]  Because even if, as we're told, it was only a test, what kind of God?
[4730.78 --> 4737.04]  What kind of God would tell someone he loves to go and do something as horrific and atrocious
[4737.04 --> 4737.88]  as that?
[4738.30 --> 4743.94]  What kind of God would put a child he loves under a test like that?
[4744.86 --> 4748.52]  But this is exactly and precisely what God does.
[4749.70 --> 4754.66]  There are times in our life when, indeed, the power of God and the love of God merge in our
[4754.66 --> 4760.70]  experience, but there are other times when we are made to question whether or not God is using
[4760.70 --> 4762.74]  his power in the service of his love.
[4762.74 --> 4765.56]  And we can begin to doubt.
[4766.44 --> 4770.68]  It looks like God's power is one thing, but we begin to question that love.
[4771.80 --> 4776.08]  Yes, there may still be light coming from the heavens, as my mom experienced, but it's more
[4776.08 --> 4779.98]  like a lightning bolt, and it is a warm ray of sunshine.
[4780.38 --> 4784.60]  And I can tell you, as somebody who's been a pastor for over 20 years, I have seen this
[4784.60 --> 4787.48]  over and over and over again.
[4787.70 --> 4791.08]  And the question has lurked into my heart sometimes, why?
[4791.08 --> 4797.00]  Why, oh God, would you allow the couple in my church who will make such amazing parents,
[4797.08 --> 4799.02]  why would you allow them to struggle with infertility?
[4799.42 --> 4803.40]  It is a roller coaster of hope and despair, as I said before.
[4804.48 --> 4807.88]  Not one year, not two, but three, four, five, six years.
[4808.14 --> 4809.30]  Why would God allow that?
[4810.30 --> 4816.66]  Why would God allow some people who so desperately desire to give love in the form of marriage?
[4816.66 --> 4819.38]  They wouldn't find the right person.
[4819.90 --> 4821.18]  And they're so lonely.
[4822.12 --> 4823.16]  Why would God do this?
[4823.18 --> 4827.28]  It doesn't look like God's power is being used in the service of God's love.
[4827.28 --> 4837.14]  Why would God allow somebody to be cliff jumping and in a freak moment crack their neck and become
[4837.14 --> 4838.04]  a quadriplegic?
[4839.16 --> 4844.68]  Why would he allow somebody's son to hit a mountainside, another one's daughter to be killed
[4844.68 --> 4847.60]  in a car crash so prematurely at 18 years old?
[4847.84 --> 4849.30]  You have stories like this.
[4849.30 --> 4854.48]  You know that there are times in our life where it does not look like God's power is being used
[4854.48 --> 4855.88]  in the service of God's love.
[4856.64 --> 4859.08]  And indeed, it makes us question that love itself.
[4860.20 --> 4864.26]  Even on a world stage right now, I don't know if you've been listening or watching the images
[4864.26 --> 4870.50]  coming out of Israel and out of Palestine, but all of the innocent life that is being lost.
[4870.58 --> 4871.76]  I'm not trying to be political here.
[4871.86 --> 4872.56]  Far from it.
[4872.56 --> 4879.60]  But my goodness, the things that are going on, is God using his power in the service of love?
[4880.46 --> 4882.78]  Sometimes we can begin to question that love.
[4883.48 --> 4887.96]  And fair enough, because life is tough and the things that happen to certain people can
[4887.96 --> 4889.18]  be unbelievably tough.
[4889.42 --> 4896.06]  But the marvel of Hebrews 11, 17 through 19, the reason that Abraham is called a hero of
[4896.06 --> 4897.80]  the faith in part is because of this.
[4897.80 --> 4904.80]  We might question God's love and we might start losing our faith and beginning not wanting
[4904.80 --> 4907.50]  to be faithful to God because what kind of God indeed?
[4907.96 --> 4910.34]  But Abraham doesn't lose his faith.
[4911.14 --> 4914.76]  He does not cease to act in faithfulness.
[4916.30 --> 4917.52]  And we say, why?
[4919.12 --> 4927.70]  Well, by faith, the author of Hebrews says, when God tested him, Abraham offered Isaac.
[4927.70 --> 4928.84]  As a sacrifice.
[4929.96 --> 4934.76]  Because he reasoned that God could raise the dead.
[4937.48 --> 4941.00]  He believed that God had the power to raise the dead.
[4941.22 --> 4945.88]  But not only could raise the dead, but indeed would raise the dead.
[4946.12 --> 4951.06]  Because God promised that his offspring would come through Isaac.
[4951.06 --> 4955.24]  You see the faith that Abraham had?
[4955.62 --> 4958.72]  Abraham believed in his heart of hearts.
[4958.88 --> 4965.60]  He was absolutely convicted that even though there may be darkness all around, even there
[4965.60 --> 4968.54]  may be incomprehensible things happening to him.
[4969.54 --> 4975.00]  There will come a time in the future when the reality of God's power and the reality of
[4975.00 --> 4979.42]  God's love merged together again in his experience.
[4981.70 --> 4985.06]  And so that ultimately, in this case, that Isaac would be raised from the dead.
[4985.32 --> 4988.70]  And as the author says, figuratively, Isaac did come back from the dead.
[4989.14 --> 4994.98]  In fact, in the story itself, God's power and love merged together in Abraham's experience
[4994.98 --> 4998.20]  when a ram is caught in the thicket providentially.
[4998.20 --> 5002.36]  And becomes the substitute sacrifice right there.
[5003.30 --> 5005.96]  And we'll say, but where did he come upon this conviction?
[5007.18 --> 5012.64]  That it must be that way that God's power and love, despite what we're going through right now,
[5012.76 --> 5014.34]  will merge again in our experience.
[5014.76 --> 5016.00]  How did he know it must happen?
[5016.06 --> 5017.80]  And I think here is what Abraham had.
[5018.42 --> 5020.76]  Which is why I spent time belaboring it earlier.
[5021.82 --> 5023.84]  Abraham had had those moments
[5023.84 --> 5028.52]  where the reality of God's power and love merged together in his experience
[5028.52 --> 5030.84]  and became unbelievably real to him.
[5030.98 --> 5033.60]  So real, in fact, that Abraham would say,
[5034.22 --> 5037.38]  this goodness I am experiencing right now,
[5037.86 --> 5039.92]  this defines reality.
[5041.24 --> 5046.24]  This is what is at the center of the center of all things.
[5047.08 --> 5048.06]  It is goodness.
[5048.42 --> 5050.90]  Oh yes, we experience a lot of things that are not goodness.
[5051.18 --> 5053.82]  We experience a lot of things that are unbelievably painful.
[5053.84 --> 5054.86]  We go through suffering.
[5055.18 --> 5058.52]  But that does not define reality with a capital R.
[5058.94 --> 5063.10]  Reality with a capital R is defined by that goodness.
[5064.14 --> 5066.20]  And he clung to that in faith.
[5066.98 --> 5069.24]  And if goodness defines reality then,
[5069.84 --> 5073.10]  and that experience you had was true,
[5074.00 --> 5075.12]  then it must be true.
[5075.68 --> 5077.54]  That after all things are burned away,
[5077.64 --> 5080.14]  after all things have played themselves out,
[5080.14 --> 5082.28]  the final tune, the final song,
[5082.40 --> 5083.50]  is going to be that merger.
[5083.84 --> 5086.96]  Of power and love to the experience of goodness once again.
[5088.40 --> 5091.64]  It's a question about what do we hold to be truly real?
[5092.64 --> 5094.14]  What is reality to you?
[5094.14 --> 5098.92]  I was in Fort Lauderdale, Florida,
[5098.92 --> 5103.40]  in I think it was 1998 or 1999 with Young Life.
[5103.52 --> 5105.48]  It was Young Life or one of these groups, I can't remember.
[5106.28 --> 5109.40]  We had driven down from the north in Calvin College in Michigan,
[5109.56 --> 5111.42]  came all the way down into the panhandle.
[5111.48 --> 5113.10]  I think we were in Miami, Daytona Beach.
[5113.16 --> 5113.98]  I don't know where it was.
[5113.98 --> 5117.78]  But we experienced such incredible community that week.
[5118.70 --> 5120.56]  We had awesome days on the beaches.
[5120.94 --> 5122.30]  We had Bible studies together.
[5122.48 --> 5123.80]  People shared their stories.
[5124.42 --> 5125.88]  We came to love each other.
[5126.00 --> 5127.44]  There was about 15 of us.
[5127.56 --> 5129.38]  And there was harmony in the group.
[5129.54 --> 5132.40]  It was a time of pure sweetness and pure goodness.
[5132.54 --> 5133.22]  It really was.
[5133.86 --> 5136.84]  And I will never forget that as we were preparing to go home,
[5137.10 --> 5139.36]  the long ride back up to Calvin into the cold,
[5139.44 --> 5140.82]  because it was wintertime as well,
[5141.60 --> 5143.44]  that one of the girls there said,
[5143.56 --> 5147.68]  you know, I guess we just have to go back to reality, don't we?
[5148.14 --> 5148.92]  Go back to Calvin.
[5149.02 --> 5150.02]  We got to go back to reality.
[5150.14 --> 5150.96]  Back to the tests.
[5151.22 --> 5153.06]  Back to the strife that was in her family.
[5153.06 --> 5156.02]  The conflict situation in her family system.
[5156.24 --> 5157.82]  Yeah, we got to go back to reality.
[5158.94 --> 5159.76]  And our youth leader said,
[5159.84 --> 5160.76]  whoa, hold on a second.
[5160.76 --> 5162.22]  And I know that that is real.
[5162.98 --> 5164.58]  But you know, in another sense,
[5164.68 --> 5167.14]  what we've been experiencing here this week,
[5167.90 --> 5169.46]  with the love between us,
[5170.28 --> 5174.30]  the intimacy, the joy, the tenderness,
[5175.12 --> 5176.28]  this is reality.
[5177.02 --> 5180.18]  And what we get to do is take this piece of reality
[5180.18 --> 5183.36]  and go back and bring this real
[5183.36 --> 5186.02]  into that, in a sense, unreal.
[5186.48 --> 5188.90]  Because those things will pass away.
[5188.90 --> 5191.84]  When you're in times that are difficult,
[5192.18 --> 5193.38]  when you're suffering,
[5193.66 --> 5195.90]  when you're beginning to question God's love,
[5196.76 --> 5198.28]  how do you cope with that?
[5200.58 --> 5203.92]  Can you go back to those experiences of goodness
[5203.92 --> 5206.50]  where the reality of God's power and love
[5206.50 --> 5207.90]  merged in your own experience?
[5209.18 --> 5211.24]  And can you say, this is what defines reality?
[5211.24 --> 5216.72]  And therefore, this is what we will come back to.
[5217.70 --> 5220.72]  You know, friends, we have much greater basis
[5220.72 --> 5222.96]  to have faith in this way
[5222.96 --> 5225.28]  and to continue to be faithful because of this
[5225.28 --> 5226.54]  than Abraham did.
[5227.24 --> 5228.18]  And you'll say, why?
[5229.38 --> 5230.16]  And you know the answer?
[5232.06 --> 5233.84]  It's because we have the witness,
[5234.20 --> 5235.52]  eyewitness testimony
[5235.52 --> 5238.92]  that the reality of God's power
[5238.92 --> 5240.34]  and the reality of God's love
[5240.34 --> 5242.74]  has merged at a single point in time
[5242.74 --> 5244.22]  in a climactic way,
[5244.36 --> 5246.02]  in the supreme way,
[5246.94 --> 5248.30]  in Jesus Christ our Lord.
[5248.84 --> 5251.80]  He who lived the life that we were supposed to live,
[5251.92 --> 5253.88]  died the death that we were supposed to die,
[5254.80 --> 5257.00]  and ushered in, yes,
[5257.38 --> 5259.66]  ushered in God's new creation.
[5259.66 --> 5263.52]  We have already been given a picture
[5263.52 --> 5265.42]  in the resurrection of Christ
[5265.42 --> 5268.80]  of what the future for us will look like
[5268.80 --> 5270.54]  who have aligned ourselves with this goodness.
[5271.36 --> 5272.80]  It looks very good indeed.
[5273.12 --> 5274.68]  It looks like resurrection life.
[5274.86 --> 5276.56]  It looks like the overcoming of death.
[5276.80 --> 5279.08]  It looks like the wiping away of all tears,
[5279.36 --> 5281.42]  all mourning, and all reasons for sadness.
[5282.86 --> 5285.80]  Oh yes, we have great reason for hope.
[5286.56 --> 5289.34]  We have great reason to cling to faith.
[5289.66 --> 5292.10]  That at the center of the center of all things is goodness.
[5292.28 --> 5293.84]  And ask yourself the question,
[5294.34 --> 5296.74]  what if you trusted God's love in this way?
[5297.34 --> 5298.90]  What if you really believed
[5298.90 --> 5300.46]  that at the center of all things
[5300.46 --> 5302.50]  was this word of goodness,
[5302.64 --> 5304.68]  and it will have the final word,
[5305.02 --> 5306.48]  despite the fact that you're walking
[5306.48 --> 5308.62]  through the valley of the shadow right now,
[5308.90 --> 5310.22]  despite the fact that our world
[5310.22 --> 5312.24]  is walking through that shadow right now.
[5313.00 --> 5315.02]  My former professor, Bruce Waltke,
[5315.02 --> 5318.42]  tells a story of a man in the 1800s
[5318.42 --> 5320.90]  who had lived his whole life in the deep south.
[5321.74 --> 5323.36]  There were no TVs in those days.
[5323.46 --> 5325.12]  There was no phones, no cell phones.
[5326.08 --> 5328.58]  But he had heard that in northern Canada,
[5329.20 --> 5331.12]  the lakes get so cold
[5331.12 --> 5333.34]  that the water freezes to the point
[5333.34 --> 5335.80]  where a human being can even walk on the water.
[5336.32 --> 5337.68]  But he found this unbelievable.
[5337.98 --> 5338.24]  Really?
[5338.38 --> 5338.60]  Wow.
[5338.66 --> 5340.82]  You could walk on water in the form of ice.
[5340.92 --> 5342.48]  Does it really get that cold in places?
[5342.48 --> 5344.36]  And the lakes really get that hard.
[5344.56 --> 5347.22]  So one winter, he takes a train
[5347.22 --> 5348.80]  and he goes up into northern Canada
[5348.80 --> 5352.04]  and he stands out on the shore
[5352.04 --> 5353.58]  of this very, very large lake.
[5353.62 --> 5355.36]  And he looks out over and it's frozen.
[5356.06 --> 5358.02]  And he just stands there marveling for a while.
[5358.86 --> 5360.52]  And then he kind of puts his foot out
[5360.52 --> 5361.84]  and he tests it.
[5362.94 --> 5364.44]  And then he takes his other foot and he tests it.
[5364.48 --> 5365.86]  Then he comes on with both feet
[5365.86 --> 5367.00]  where it's very, very shallow.
[5367.62 --> 5369.28]  And then he gets down on hands and knees
[5369.28 --> 5370.48]  as the water's getting deeper below
[5370.48 --> 5371.72]  and he starts crawling out,
[5372.14 --> 5375.06]  hand over hand, knee pulling, knee up over knee.
[5375.60 --> 5379.26]  From behind him, he hears the sound of something.
[5380.20 --> 5381.78]  And it gets louder and louder
[5381.78 --> 5383.18]  as he continues to listen.
[5383.80 --> 5385.80]  It's the sound of horses and gallop.
[5385.84 --> 5387.74]  And as he turns around to look at what's coming,
[5388.10 --> 5390.26]  he sees four Clydesdale horses,
[5390.40 --> 5392.08]  which are some of the biggest horses you can imagine.
[5392.46 --> 5393.88]  Four Clydesdale horses.
[5394.64 --> 5396.82]  And a wagon behind it,
[5396.82 --> 5400.08]  a man driving these Clydesdales forward.
[5400.24 --> 5401.32]  They go out onto the lake
[5401.32 --> 5403.82]  and into the distance,
[5404.04 --> 5405.74]  charging full steam ahead.
[5406.78 --> 5407.92]  And Bruce Waltke says,
[5408.00 --> 5408.70]  he says, you know,
[5409.20 --> 5410.96]  friends, sometimes I feel like that man
[5410.96 --> 5412.92]  on all fours in my relationship with God.
[5413.00 --> 5413.70]  Can I trust you?
[5414.62 --> 5415.94]  Can I trust you with this?
[5416.36 --> 5418.00]  Can I really trust you with that?
[5419.48 --> 5421.16]  God's work in Christ
[5421.16 --> 5424.24]  and God's giving us the gift
[5424.24 --> 5426.74]  of experience of goodness in the past as well.
[5426.82 --> 5431.14]  It says that we can charge full steam ahead.
[5431.84 --> 5433.90]  We can live with radical faithfulness today
[5433.90 --> 5435.30]  to our Lord,
[5435.84 --> 5438.00]  for he is coming again.
[5438.66 --> 5439.46]  And in that day,
[5439.54 --> 5442.10]  the future will break in in its consummation.
[5442.78 --> 5443.90]  And all will be well.
[5444.22 --> 5445.84]  And all manner of things will be well.
[5447.22 --> 5448.14]  Thanks be to God.
[5448.26 --> 5448.76]  Let us pray.
[5448.82 --> 5449.22]  Amen.
[5451.46 --> 5452.66]  Lord God, we thank you
[5452.66 --> 5454.86]  that you have given us this incredible hope.
[5454.86 --> 5458.50]  Hope that one day,
[5458.72 --> 5460.34]  the reality of your power and love
[5460.34 --> 5462.30]  will be manifest in our lives.
[5462.34 --> 5464.30]  Not that we question that you are powerful
[5464.30 --> 5465.20]  and that you are loving,
[5465.80 --> 5468.78]  but that it will be fully within our experience
[5468.78 --> 5470.70]  in the future time.
[5470.70 --> 5474.40]  Lord, we pray that until that time,
[5474.52 --> 5475.64]  you would equip your church
[5475.64 --> 5480.22]  to manifest powerful love in our own lives
[5480.22 --> 5483.84]  so that people would there have a third witness,
[5484.46 --> 5486.18]  Lord, that we can trust what is coming.
[5486.98 --> 5489.60]  And that even though things are so difficult right now,
[5489.66 --> 5491.66]  even though we live in a veil of tears sometimes,
[5491.66 --> 5494.82]  that we can trust that you indeed will make all things well.
[5494.82 --> 5497.58]  hearten us unto faith, we pray,
[5497.70 --> 5499.08]  for the sake of Jesus Christ
[5499.08 --> 5500.30]  and in the power of your spirit.
[5501.14 --> 5502.50]  It is in his name we pray.
[5503.08 --> 5503.36]  Amen.
[5509.36 --> 5511.00]  I invite you all to stand
[5511.00 --> 5514.94]  and let's confess each one of us
[5514.94 --> 5516.80]  that all we have is Christ.
[5516.80 --> 5527.00]  Hallelujah.
[5527.00 --> 5529.00]  Hallelujah.
[5530.44 --> 5534.92]  All I have is Christ.
[5535.44 --> 5536.82]  Hallelujah.
[5540.16 --> 5545.40]  Jesus is my life.
[5546.80 --> 5556.18]  I once was lost to the darkest night,
[5556.18 --> 5560.70]  yet but I knew the way.
[5561.08 --> 5564.98]  The sin that promised joy in life
[5564.98 --> 5569.54]  had led me to the grave.
[5569.90 --> 5574.14]  I had no hope that you would own,
[5574.14 --> 5578.38]  the rebel do your will.
[5578.38 --> 5582.92]  And if you had a lovely voice,
[5583.26 --> 5587.30]  I would refuse you to stand.
[5593.30 --> 5596.30]  But as I ran,
[5596.40 --> 5598.26]  I held a place
[5598.26 --> 5602.60]  in difference to the cross.
[5602.60 --> 5606.96]  You looked upon my helpless state
[5606.96 --> 5611.34]  and led me to the cross.
[5611.64 --> 5615.72]  And I beheld God's love this way.
[5615.88 --> 5620.00]  You suffered in my place.
[5620.00 --> 5622.30]  You poured my wrath,
[5622.30 --> 5624.34]  You served for me.
[5624.34 --> 5630.70]  Now all I know is grace.
[5631.38 --> 5632.30]  Hallelujah.
[5635.30 --> 5639.38]  All I have is Christ.
[5641.88 --> 5642.76]  Hallelujah.
[5642.76 --> 5647.14]  Jesus is my life.
[5647.14 --> 5654.14]  Now Lord, I would be yours alone
[5654.14 --> 5658.56]  and live the whole bright sea.
[5658.92 --> 5662.82]  The strength to follow your commands
[5662.82 --> 5667.00]  would never come from me.
[5667.00 --> 5671.38]  So Father, you, my ransom, I
[5671.38 --> 5675.62]  in any way you choose.
[5675.62 --> 5679.84]  And that my love forever be
[5679.84 --> 5685.46]  my only hope is true.
[5687.46 --> 5688.26]  Hallelujah.
[5690.26 --> 5694.56]  Oh, my God is Christ.
[5694.56 --> 5696.56]  Hallelujah.
[5696.56 --> 5697.56]  Hallelujah.
[5698.76 --> 5702.76]  Jesus is my life.
[5703.30 --> 5704.40]  Hallelujah.
[5707.10 --> 5710.86]  All I have is Christ.
[5711.52 --> 5712.56]  Hallelujah.
[5715.52 --> 5719.56]  Jesus is my life.
[5719.56 --> 5720.56]  Hallelujah.
[5724.56 --> 5725.74]  Sisters and brothers in Christ,
[5725.84 --> 5727.14]  as you go into this day
[5727.14 --> 5728.00]  and into a new week,
[5728.14 --> 5729.34]  know that our Lord goes with you
[5729.34 --> 5730.72]  and he puts his blessing over you.
[5731.26 --> 5732.84]  The Lord bless you and keep you.
[5733.02 --> 5734.60]  The Lord make his face shine upon you
[5734.60 --> 5735.62]  and be gracious to you.
[5736.14 --> 5737.50]  The Lord turn his face fully
[5737.50 --> 5738.30]  in your direction
[5738.30 --> 5739.66]  and grant you his peace
[5739.66 --> 5741.46]  both now and forevermore.
[5741.68 --> 5742.72]  And all God's people say,
[5743.38 --> 5743.62]  Amen.
[5743.62 --> 5743.74]  Amen.
[5743.74 --> 5743.78]  Amen.
[5743.78 --> 5745.78]  Amen.

[5825.56 --> 5836.28]  there's a shield in our hand and a sword at our side there's a fire in our spirit that cannot be
[5836.28 --> 5853.56]  denied that the father has told us for these you have died
