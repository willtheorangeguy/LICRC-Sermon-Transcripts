[1565.98 → 1567.66] my hope is
[1567.66 → 1569.50] only Jesus
[1569.50 → 1571.90] for my
[1571.90 → 1573.66] life is
[1573.66 → 1574.98] only bound
[1574.98 → 1577.10] to his
[1577.10 → 1578.80] oh how
[1578.80 → 1579.72] strange
[1579.72 → 1580.92] and divine
[1580.92 → 1582.70] I can see
[1582.70 → 1583.78] all is
[1583.78 → 1584.56] blind
[1584.56 → 1585.50] yet no
[1585.50 → 1586.12] die
[1586.12 → 1587.16] but through
[1587.16 → 1588.04] Christ
[1588.04 → 1588.98] we may
[1588.98 → 1601.42] the night
[1601.42 → 1602.46] the night is
[1602.46 → 1603.44] dark
[1603.44 → 1605.52] but I am not
[1605.52 → 1606.92] forsaken
[1606.92 → 1609.36] for by my
[1609.36 → 1610.30] side
[1610.30 → 1611.66] the Saviour
[1611.66 → 1614.24] he will save
[1614.24 → 1615.56] I labour
[1615.56 → 1615.82] I labour
[1615.82 → 1615.88] I labour
[1615.88 → 1616.98] on
[1616.98 → 1617.68] in
[1617.68 → 1618.56] weakness
[1618.56 → 1620.56] and rejoicing

[1622.40 → 1623.70] thy need
[1623.70 → 1625.28] his power
[1625.28 → 1626.10] is
[1626.10 → 1626.56] to say
[1626.56 → 1629.34] to this
[1629.34 → 1629.88] I hope
[1629.88 → 1632.04] my shepherd
[1632.04 → 1633.88] will defend
[1633.88 → 1635.08] me
[1635.08 → 1636.74] through the
[1636.74 → 1638.38] deepest
[1638.38 → 1639.88] valley
[1639.88 → 1643.66] but I
[1643.66 → 1647.32] UN
[1647.32 → 1647.96] I
[1647.96 → 1648.28] shall
[1648.28 → 1648.74] overcome
[1648.74 → 1650.26] and
[1650.26 → 1650.82] and
[1650.82 → 1650.94] what I
[1650.94 → 1651.54] the
[1651.54 → 1652.68] Christ
[1652.68 → 1653.26] in
[1653.26 → 1654.08] love
[1654.08 → 1654.64] term
[1654.88 → 1657.12] no
[1657.12 → 1671.98] O fate I dread, I know I am forgiven
[1671.98 → 1679.22] The future's sure, the price it has been paid
[1679.22 → 1686.48] For Jesus bled and suffered for my body
[1686.48 → 1693.18] And He was raised to overcome the grave
[1693.18 → 1700.02] To the disciples and sinners with the leader
[1700.02 → 1706.74] Jesus, my Lord, we never enter the grave
[1706.74 → 1712.60] O Lord, we change the limits of the love we see
[1712.60 → 1719.30] I am free and God I need God's strength
[1719.30 → 1728.54] With every man I long to follow Jesus
[1728.54 → 1737.86] With every man I long to love with Jesus
[1737.86 → 1744.78] For He has said that He will make me whole
[1744.78 → 1751.96] And day by day I know He will forgive me
[1751.96 → 1757.90] Until I stand rejoining for the Lord
[1757.90 → 1765.98] To this I want my hope is only Jesus
[1765.98 → 1772.26] For the glory evermore to Him
[1772.26 → 1776.82] When the race is complete
[1776.82 → 1780.56] Still my list shall be beat
[1780.56 → 1785.92] Can not I come through Christ in me
[1785.92 → 1794.00] To this I hold my hope is only Jesus
[1794.00 → 1800.88] All the glory evermore to Him
[1800.88 → 1805.54] When the race is complete
[1805.54 → 1809.38] Still my list shall be beat
[1809.38 → 1815.46] Let not I come through Christ in me
[1815.46 → 1823.46] Let not I come through Christ in me
[1823.46 → 1831.54] Let not I come through Christ in me
[1831.54 → 1854.86] My name is Brenda, and I'm the Deacon here.
[1854.86 → 1864.22] And the offering this morning is for the budget as well as for the refugee sponsorship program here.
[1864.40 → 1867.14] And Peter Van Heuser is going to share an update with us.
[1870.84 → 1872.04] Thank you, Brenda.
[1873.38 → 1874.34] Good morning, church.
[1875.52 → 1880.00] This morning our collection is for the refugee sponsorship committee.
[1880.00 → 1889.28] We are, as I've spoken to you about previously, is about the Never family who we're hoping to sponsor.
[1889.52 → 1897.94] It's been given approval through World Renew, and it's been accepted initially through the way the Canadian government works.
[1898.42 → 1900.74] And so we're awaiting what's happening there.
[1900.78 → 1904.48] In the meantime, we are sponsoring the two children to go to school.
[1904.64 → 1907.64] So they're in school, and they're very pleased with that.
[1907.64 → 1915.34] I don't know about you, but whenever I see the news, there always seems to be an aspect of refugees,
[1916.04 → 1920.80] people who have to flee asylum, who are looking for asylum, are moving.
[1921.52 → 1924.08] And this week it was on the Armenians.
[1924.30 → 1932.24] There's that little part of the parcel that's part of Azerbaijan, and the government came in and just pushed them.
[1932.24 → 1938.90] And it looks like a good chunk of them are moving out of their country and moving to the main part of Armenia.
[1939.46 → 1944.96] And if you know the history of Armenia, you will know that they've had a long history of that sort of thing.
[1945.58 → 1954.96] The Mural family, the mother, her grandparents were part of the Armenian time when they were defeated,
[1954.96 → 1957.04] and many of them lost their lives.
[1957.22 → 1959.56] It was a huge massacre of those folk.
[1960.18 → 1963.40] It always, it seems to be going on all the time.
[1964.04 → 1967.36] Anyway, we're playing a very, very small part of that.
[1967.90 → 1971.96] We've been able to sponsor some, but even we have the opportunity.
[1972.24 → 1973.64] Calls go into the office.
[1974.26 → 1979.40] Just this week, Jackie and I met with a family that came out of Afghanistan,
[1979.40 → 1985.38] who had to flee into Pakistan, and they dearly desire, want to have their family coming here.
[1985.44 → 1991.06] Of course, we can't help them, but these are people who worked and supported the Canadian Armed Forces.
[1991.74 → 1996.10] Now they're here, and they miss their families, and you just hear their, you just hear their grief.
[1996.54 → 2002.46] So there's a whole area, if you're interested in being involved in, and have some interest in it,
[2002.46 → 2008.94] there's a tremendous area of, that we can even as a church support people who are lonely,
[2009.10 → 2013.86] who feel, who just feel, feel they need a sense of community,
[2013.86 → 2017.36] because they come here and often have no one else to go to.
[2017.78 → 2021.98] Anyway, I just thought I'd bring that to your attention, but we do need your support.
[2022.12 → 2024.36] We're going to need about $35,000 to $40,000.
[2024.86 → 2027.84] I think we've got 15 in the bank, so we've got a way to go.
[2027.98 → 2028.40] Thank you.
[2032.46 → 2062.44] Thank you.
[2062.46 → 2064.46] Thank you.
[2064.46 → 2092.44] Thank you.
[2092.46 → 2094.46] Thank you.
[2094.46 → 2122.44] Thank you.
[2122.46 → 2124.46] Thank you.
[2124.46 → 2152.44] Thank you.
[2152.46 → 2156.46] Be the fire in my heart.
[2156.46 → 2159.46] Be the wind in these sails.
[2159.46 → 2163.96] Be the wind in these sails.
[2163.96 → 2170.14] Be the reason that I live.
[2170.14 → 2175.46] Jesus, Jesus.
[2175.46 → 2185.46] Jesus, Jesus.
[2185.46 → 2186.46] Be the fire in my heart.
[2186.46 → 2196.54] Be the wind in these sails.
[2196.54 → 2205.18] That I live, Jesus, Jesus.
[2222.14 → 2223.62] Good morning, everybody.
[2226.54 → 2230.44] Can all the kids from preschool to grade four come up to the front?
[2235.78 → 2236.66] Hi, guys.
[2245.94 → 2247.70] How is everybody doing this morning?
[2248.34 → 2248.82] Good.
[2249.48 → 2252.24] I have a question for you guys.
[2252.24 → 2261.02] What is something that you like the inside of better than the outside?
[2265.66 → 2266.26] Amelia.
[2266.26 → 2271.58] What is something you like the inside better than the outside?
[2272.00 → 2276.48] So is it some type of food or being outside your house?
[2276.60 → 2277.14] What do you think?
[2280.04 → 2280.48] Banana.
[2280.60 → 2282.94] You like the inside of the banana better than the outside?
[2283.26 → 2284.08] That's a good one.
[2284.16 → 2285.20] Is anybody else?
[2287.68 → 2287.98] Yeah.
[2287.98 → 2292.88] You like the apple better than the core?
[2292.98 → 2295.02] So that's the outside instead of the inside.
[2295.18 → 2296.10] Is anybody else?
[2296.50 → 2297.52] You get one more?
[2297.76 → 2298.02] No?
[2298.72 → 2299.86] Well, I think.
[2300.14 → 2300.72] Yes, Malachi.
[2303.88 → 2304.40] Cake.
[2305.24 → 2307.18] You like the outside of the cake?
[2307.18 → 2314.12] Well, I like the inside better than the outside in the Oreos.
[2315.06 → 2317.90] So today, yeah, they're fun, hey?
[2318.32 → 2322.92] Or a donut, the Boston cream donuts.
[2323.14 → 2325.08] I like the filling better than the outside.
[2325.08 → 2332.76] So today, in children's worship time, we are going to talk about Cain and Abel,
[2333.66 → 2343.32] and how one of them made a choice that God saw in favour,
[2344.18 → 2347.88] whether it was an outside choice or a choice from his heart.
[2348.20 → 2350.88] So we're going to discuss that today in children's worship time,
[2350.96 → 2353.44] and we're going to see what that is all about.
[2353.44 → 2357.20] So right now, we're going to do a prayer,
[2357.64 → 2361.38] and my prayer today is our memory verse for the month.
[2361.96 → 2362.18] Okay?
[2362.40 → 2366.78] So if everybody can close their eyes, put your hands in your lap,
[2367.02 → 2370.06] and we're going to do a simple prayer here from the Bible.
[2371.04 → 2373.48] God, see what is in my heart.
[2374.18 → 2377.70] Help me live in the way that is always right.
[2378.70 → 2379.26] Amen.
[2379.26 → 2384.94] Can everybody stand up and look towards the congregation?
[2387.22 → 2390.02] And everybody in children's worship time, what do we say?
[2390.54 → 2391.60] The Lord.
[2391.72 → 2392.80] He with you.
[2393.18 → 2394.74] And also with you.
[2394.74 → 2395.02] Amen.
[2395.02 → 2395.08] Amen.
[2395.08 → 2396.02] Amen.
[2396.02 → 2397.02] Amen.
[2397.02 → 2398.02] Amen.
[2398.02 → 2398.08] Amen.
[2398.08 → 2399.08] Amen.
[2399.08 → 2400.08] Amen.
[2400.08 → 2401.08] Amen.
[2401.08 → 2402.08] Amen.
[2402.08 → 2403.08] Amen.
[2403.08 → 2404.08] Amen.
[2404.08 → 2405.08] Amen.
[2405.08 → 2406.08] Amen.
[2406.08 → 2407.08] Amen.
[2407.08 → 2408.08] Amen.
[2408.08 → 2409.08] Amen.
[2409.08 → 2416.04] Amen.
[2416.38 → 2417.58] Amen.
[2424.74 → 2425.14] Amen.
[2425.14 → 2425.92] Amen.
[2425.92 → 2430.78] May with you, I'm an elder here at Emmanuel C DAR to me, and I'm going to be leading us
[2430.84 → 2432.26] on the congregational prayer this morning.
[2432.26 → 2435.90] Before we begin, though, I just have a few announcements.
[2435.90 → 2441.22] first as many of you have seen in our bulletin Amanda's mom Thelma was in
[2441.22 → 2447.68] the hospital for some time in palliative care she did pass on yesterday and
[2447.68 → 2451.58] and yesterday morning she passed away, but the family is very grateful for all
[2451.58 → 2455.62] the love and care and support and the meals that have been provided by
[2455.62 → 2461.04] everyone throughout the past while we truly felt God's nearness through the
[2461.04 → 2467.64] body of Christ and through all of your prayers and kindness also announcing
[2467.64 → 2473.76] that next week Sunday we will have our Thanksgiving Day service so the in the
[2473.76 → 2478.26] past we've had services on the Monday, but we will be doing a special Thanksgiving
[2478.26 → 2486.24] service next Sunday on October 8th and also as we're gathering together next
[2486.24 → 2491.94] Sunday we'll be having the Lord's Supper so you're encouraged to take time to
[2491.94 → 2496.68] reflect on and think about the sacrament with your families it's such an amazing
[2496.68 → 2503.28] gift to allow us to touch and taste and see this reminder that the elements
[2503.28 → 2508.74] serve as the reminder of the grace that Christ pours on out on us constantly I
[2508.74 → 2514.76] always remember when my kids were littler, and especially we were visiting a
[2514.76 → 2517.26] church that did things a little differently than ours, and they did
[2517.26 → 2521.36] communion near the beginning of the service and my boys hadn't really
[2521.36 → 2525.74] seen the communion before as they were little toddlers and when they saw people
[2525.74 → 2529.58] getting up kind of on their own to walk to the front receive the elements of the
[2529.58 → 2532.70] corner of my eye I just saw one of my kids just bolt for the aisle and like full
[2532.70 → 2536.30] on sprint like he was going to attack the elder that was at the front with the
[2536.30 → 2539.94] elements, and so I was still a little more quick and nimble at the time was able to
[2539.94 → 2544.50] jump up in a few strides scoop him up and catch him before he got away, and it was
[2544.50 → 2551.28] like a full-on scream I want a snack too and yeah it was kind of a nice quiet
[2551.28 → 2555.32] reflective holy moment that there definitely wasn't a person in the church that
[2555.32 → 2559.72] didn't hear that but at the same time I reflect on it's like wow two things one
[2559.72 → 2563.82] that was a great time for us to start teaching our kids about what communion
[2563.82 → 2568.26] was about and what it really meant and number two is like wow I hope I can
[2568.26 → 2574.30] come to the table with that sort of longing and hunger to participate next week, so I
[2574.30 → 2578.38] pray all that for all of us that we will take time this week to really reflect
[2578.38 → 2584.26] on communion and to anticipate and come together around the table of
[2584.26 → 2589.78] grace so at this time let's bow our heads and hearts and let's turn to our Lord in
[2589.78 → 2598.62] prayer our Father in heaven our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ Holy Spirit we lift and
[2598.62 → 2605.36] praise your holy name in worship we know that your name Lord is a strong and fortified tower
[2605.36 → 2613.46] the righteous run to it and are safe you are our shepherd, and we are your sheep as your flock
[2613.46 → 2619.88] Lord we gather here to worship you knowing that you guide us on paths of righteousness for your name's
[2619.88 → 2627.86] sake and Lord this morning as we have heard in the reading of Psalm 23 we know that your rod and staff
[2627.86 → 2636.24] they comfort us as a community of believers at Emmanuel Church Lord we put our hope and trust in you alone and we
[2636.24 → 2644.96] bring you our thanksgiving and sorrows alike asking you to be our comfort and guide for all things Lord we pray for
[2644.96 → 2654.86] our world so many have become lost and gone astray we pray for people in places dealing with war hunger injustice and
[2654.86 → 2674.86] persecution we pray for refugees who have been pushed out of their places where they live Lord in various struggles we thank you for the freedoms and peace that we experience here in our time, but we pray that you forgive us Lord for any indifference we have toward the plights of so many of our brothers and sisters throughout the world
[2674.86 → 2700.86] Lord we pray for world leaders that they would seek your will and lead with the authority that comes from you alone Lord we also confess that our fallen state brings each one of us to our knees in need of your grace lead us not into temptation Lord but deliver us from evil Lord we pray for those in our congregation who are in seasons of life's difficulties
[2700.86 → 2728.86] we pray for those who have lost loved ones recently and those who mourn and grieve the loss of those who have been gone even for some time Lord we pray for the Kiss family as Bob's sister passed away, and they had the funeral this past week we pray also for the Tastemaker family as they enter a time of mourning and grieving the loss of Thelma Lord we know and trust that blessed are those who mourn for they will be comforted
[2728.86 → 2758.84] for they will be comforted comfort us Lord Jesus we pray for all those who are dealing with health challenges Lord we pray for Judy Dijkstra with ongoing health issues, and we also lift Ellen White who has been dealing with a variety of health challenges over the past while Lord we lift those struggling with mental and physical health we see so many struggles and challenges that come on us in this life, but we trust that you give
[2758.84 → 2788.82] you give us everything we stand in need of you restore our health and heal our diseases Lord we pray your healing in our lives and we that we would feel your nearness and presence in our lives in all circumstances Lord we pray for those who are travelling, and we ask for safety and your hand on the youth leaders of this church who are attending a leaders retreat this weekend we also pray for Elam Maquette who's leaving this week to Australia for six months and Lord we pray for
[2788.82 → 2818.80] safe travels that you would use Elam and his new community we pray for Emmanuel Church Lord this body and the ministry season that is starting up again Lord we pray for all the ministry leaders that you would use them to grow the knowledge and understanding and experience of your grace in each person that is ministered to and Lord we pray for the council and staff here at Emmanuel Holy Spirit draw us to serve willingly and use each one of us to grow your kingdom
[2818.80 → 2848.80] and share the gospel of salvation and share the gospel of salvation in Jesus Christ to everyone we meet Lord we ask you to be with us this week as we prepare our hearts and as we look forward to celebrating the Lord's Supper together next week and Lord we pray for Pastor Steve as he leads us in opening the word and as he shares your message with us this morning we pray Father that your spirit move through us and to open our ears and hearts to hear and be challenged by your word for us today
[2848.80 → 2850.80] Amen
[2850.80 → 2867.52] I invite you to open up your Bibles to John chapter 10
[2867.52 → 2871.10] and as you're working your way there
[2871.10 → 2877.48] just a little bit of notes about what's going on we're just jumping into the Gospel of John here
[2877.48 → 2881.44] and I think it's helpful just to know a little bit about the context
[2881.44 → 2885.70] so right before John chapter 10 is chapter 9
[2885.70 → 2890.02] and we have this story of Jesus healing someone
[2890.02 → 2893.86] but the religious leaders the shepherds of the day
[2893.86 → 2897.08] end up kicking this guy out
[2897.08 → 2902.32] the verse 34 of chapter 9 is pretty telling of what just happens
[2902.32 → 2904.88] to him, they replied
[2904.88 → 2907.04] you were steeped in sin at birth
[2907.04 → 2908.52] how dare you lecture us
[2908.52 → 2910.00] and then they threw him out
[2910.00 → 2912.76] so you kind of have this gatekeeping
[2912.76 → 2915.54] of the shepherds of the day
[2915.54 → 2917.08] that's happening
[2917.08 → 2919.00] right before
[2919.00 → 2922.64] Jesus starts speaking
[2922.64 → 2925.54] and this is how Jesus responds
[2925.54 → 2926.62] hear God's word
[2926.62 → 2931.12] very truly I tell you Pharisees
[2931.12 → 2935.04] anyone who does not enter the sheep pen by the gate
[2935.04 → 2938.28] but climbs in by some other way is a thief or a robber
[2938.28 → 2941.88] the one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep
[2941.88 → 2944.40] the gatekeeper opens the gate for him
[2944.40 → 2946.78] and the sheep listen to his voice
[2946.78 → 2950.72] he calls his own sheep by name
[2950.72 → 2951.80] and leads them out
[2951.80 → 2954.74] when he has brought out all his own
[2954.74 → 2955.92] he goes ahead of them
[2955.92 → 2957.50] and the sheep follow them
[2957.50 → 2959.18] because they know his voice
[2959.18 → 2961.90] but they will never follow a stranger
[2961.90 → 2963.56] in fact they will run away from him
[2963.56 → 2966.08] because they do not recognize a stranger's voice
[2966.08 → 2969.58] Jesus used this as a figure of speech
[2969.58 → 2971.00] but the Pharisees didn't understand
[2971.00 → 2972.32] what he was telling them
[2972.32 → 2974.46] therefore Jesus said again
[2974.46 → 2976.62] very truly I tell you
[2976.62 → 2977.98] I am the gate for the sheep
[2977.98 → 2979.74] all who have come before me
[2979.74 → 2980.88] are thieves and robbers
[2980.88 → 2983.10] but the sheep have not listened to them
[2983.10 → 2985.48] I am the gate
[2985.48 → 2987.80] whoever enters through me will be saved
[2987.80 → 2990.20] they will come in and go out
[2990.20 → 2991.14] and find pasture
[2991.14 → 2993.30] the thief only comes to steal
[2993.30 → 2994.34] and kill and destroy
[2994.34 → 2995.42] I have come
[2995.42 → 2997.30] that they may have life
[2997.30 → 2999.08] and have it to the full
[2999.08 → 3002.84] I am the good shepherd
[3002.84 → 3004.76] the good shepherd
[3004.76 → 3007.30] lays down his life for the sheep
[3007.30 → 3009.52] the hired hand is not a shepherd
[3009.52 → 3011.10] and does not own the sheep
[3011.10 → 3013.48] so when he sees the wolf coming
[3013.48 → 3014.74] he abandons the sheep
[3014.74 → 3015.64] and runs away
[3015.64 → 3018.32] then the wolf attacks the flock
[3018.32 → 3019.22] and scatters it
[3019.22 → 3020.16] the man runs away
[3020.16 → 3021.30] because he is a hired hand
[3021.30 → 3022.66] and cares nothing for the sheep
[3022.66 → 3024.96] I am the good shepherd
[3024.96 → 3027.46] I know my sheep
[3027.46 → 3029.00] and my sheep know me
[3029.00 → 3030.88] just as the father knows me
[3030.88 → 3031.86] and I know the father
[3031.86 → 3034.12] and I lay my life down
[3034.12 → 3035.32] for the sheep
[3035.32 → 3037.52] I have other sheep
[3037.52 → 3038.98] that are not of this pen
[3038.98 → 3040.86] I must bring them also
[3040.86 → 3041.52] they too
[3041.52 → 3042.94] listen to my voice
[3042.94 → 3045.32] and there shall be one flock
[3045.32 → 3046.22] and one shepherd
[3046.22 → 3048.44] the reason my father loves me
[3048.44 → 3049.98] is I lay down my life
[3049.98 → 3051.20] only to take it up again
[3051.20 → 3053.46] no one takes it from me
[3053.46 → 3055.04] but I lay it down
[3055.04 → 3056.24] of my own accord
[3056.24 → 3057.18] I have the authority
[3057.18 → 3058.42] to lay it down
[3058.42 → 3059.30] and the authority
[3059.30 → 3060.30] to take it up again
[3060.30 → 3061.78] this command I received
[3061.78 → 3062.96] from my father
[3062.96 → 3065.70] the Jews who heard these words
[3065.70 → 3066.66] were divided
[3066.66 → 3068.24] many of them said
[3068.24 → 3069.34] he is demon possessed
[3069.34 → 3070.34] and raving mad
[3070.34 → 3071.42] why listen to him
[3071.42 → 3072.78] but others said
[3072.78 → 3074.82] these are not the sayings
[3074.82 → 3076.24] of a man possessed by a demon
[3076.24 → 3079.08] can a demon open the eyes
[3079.08 → 3079.84] of the blind
[3079.84 → 3084.58] the word of the lord
[3084.58 → 3086.96] thanks be to god
[3086.96 → 3094.40] so in our passage
[3094.40 → 3095.18] we had
[3095.18 → 3097.46] Jesus referring to himself
[3097.46 → 3099.60] as the good shepherd
[3099.60 → 3100.88] and
[3100.88 → 3102.88] I think it's kind of neat
[3102.88 → 3104.18] that the
[3104.18 → 3105.98] the idea of shepherd
[3105.98 → 3106.60] shepherd
[3106.60 → 3107.58] has a pretty good
[3107.58 → 3108.34] staying power
[3108.34 → 3109.40] for a metaphor
[3109.40 → 3110.16] that this is
[3110.16 → 3112.26] over 2,000 years ago
[3112.26 → 3112.62] and
[3112.62 → 3113.24] and Jesus
[3113.24 → 3115.12] or about 2,000 years ago
[3115.12 → 3116.68] and even though
[3116.68 → 3116.90] we're
[3116.90 → 3117.60] kind of people
[3117.60 → 3118.36] living in cities
[3118.36 → 3120.10] I don't own any sheep
[3120.10 → 3120.60] I don't know
[3120.60 → 3121.12] what it's like
[3121.12 → 3122.32] really to be a shepherd
[3122.32 → 3124.12] but there's something
[3124.12 → 3125.10] about the metaphor
[3125.10 → 3126.40] that is comforting
[3126.40 → 3126.98] we were reading
[3126.98 → 3128.14] the words earlier today
[3128.14 → 3128.42] from
[3128.42 → 3129.98] Psalm 23
[3129.98 → 3131.48] and we didn't need
[3131.48 → 3132.66] to have this explained
[3132.66 → 3133.44] any extra
[3133.44 → 3134.10] we just know
[3134.10 → 3134.92] of the comfort
[3134.92 → 3135.40] that it is
[3135.40 → 3136.16] to be in the presence
[3136.16 → 3137.86] of the good shepherd
[3137.86 → 3140.92] now this
[3140.92 → 3142.28] simple observation
[3142.28 → 3142.94] a lot of people
[3142.94 → 3143.86] have tried to weigh in
[3143.86 → 3144.46] like why
[3144.46 → 3145.44] why does this
[3145.44 → 3146.24] just immediately
[3146.24 → 3147.72] make so much sense
[3147.72 → 3148.34] to us
[3148.34 → 3149.70] and one of my
[3149.70 → 3150.70] favourite explanations
[3150.70 → 3151.44] is
[3151.44 → 3152.16] that
[3152.16 → 3153.86] we know what it's like
[3153.86 → 3154.64] to be sheep
[3154.64 → 3155.72] that's my drawing
[3155.72 → 3156.14] of a sheep
[3156.14 → 3156.78] hopefully it
[3156.78 → 3158.50] semi-resembles
[3158.50 → 3159.32] your imagination
[3159.32 → 3159.92] of a sheep
[3159.92 → 3160.78] you can draw your own
[3160.78 → 3161.28] if you like
[3161.28 → 3163.32] but we know
[3163.32 → 3163.84] what it's like
[3163.84 → 3164.96] to be sheep
[3164.96 → 3165.42] we know
[3165.42 → 3166.30] that the vulnerability
[3166.30 → 3168.42] that sheep have
[3168.42 → 3169.46] the feeling
[3169.46 → 3170.46] of helplessness
[3170.46 → 3171.56] of just needing
[3171.56 → 3172.38] a guide
[3172.38 → 3173.70] needing something
[3173.70 → 3174.70] beyond ourselves
[3174.70 → 3175.72] we know how easily
[3175.72 → 3177.06] we can get frightened
[3177.06 → 3177.90] how easily
[3177.90 → 3179.12] we can get distracted
[3179.12 → 3180.26] that we are needy
[3180.26 → 3180.82] and insecure
[3180.82 → 3182.28] that we know
[3182.28 → 3182.94] what it's like
[3182.94 → 3184.44] to be sheep
[3184.44 → 3185.42] and I'm sure
[3185.42 → 3186.18] some of us
[3186.18 → 3187.34] would prefer
[3187.34 → 3188.40] it otherwise
[3188.40 → 3189.68] we kind of try
[3189.68 → 3190.86] to make ourselves
[3190.86 → 3191.94] a little bit more secure
[3191.94 → 3193.10] maybe we think
[3193.10 → 3194.60] that we're more lions
[3194.60 → 3195.92] or tigers
[3195.92 → 3197.24] or bears
[3197.24 → 3201.44] but I think
[3201.44 → 3202.16] when we have
[3202.16 → 3203.66] any sort of
[3203.66 → 3205.54] pressures around us
[3205.54 → 3206.22] when we're faced
[3206.22 → 3206.80] with the really
[3206.80 → 3207.90] challenging things
[3207.90 → 3208.36] of life
[3208.36 → 3209.48] that we
[3209.48 → 3210.62] are reminded
[3210.62 → 3211.54] that we really
[3211.54 → 3212.08] are
[3212.08 → 3213.78] like sheep
[3213.78 → 3215.66] those images
[3215.66 → 3216.36] of our strength
[3216.36 → 3217.18] kind of fade
[3217.18 → 3218.26] when we see
[3218.26 → 3219.28] our own vulnerability
[3219.28 → 3221.08] in times of crisis
[3221.08 → 3223.14] when I come
[3223.14 → 3224.08] and visit people
[3224.08 → 3225.58] in hospice care
[3225.58 → 3226.46] palliative care
[3226.46 → 3227.32] or I'm doing
[3227.32 → 3228.38] a graveside service
[3228.38 → 3229.14] often people
[3229.14 → 3230.20] will request
[3230.20 → 3231.20] the words
[3231.20 → 3232.52] from Psalm 23
[3232.52 → 3234.48] words that remind us
[3234.48 → 3235.10] that God
[3235.10 → 3236.06] is our shepherd
[3236.06 → 3239.62] it's these reminders
[3239.62 → 3240.42] that we need
[3240.42 → 3241.06] in these times
[3241.06 → 3241.82] where we feel
[3241.82 → 3243.62] tiny
[3243.62 → 3244.66] and helpless
[3244.66 → 3246.48] that we need
[3246.48 → 3246.92] to know
[3246.92 → 3248.20] that someone else
[3248.20 → 3249.10] is in charge
[3249.10 → 3250.18] someone who knows
[3250.18 → 3250.52] us
[3250.52 → 3252.40] and can protect us
[3252.40 → 3253.58] we know
[3253.58 → 3254.96] that we need
[3254.96 → 3256.16] a shepherd
[3256.16 → 3258.48] and of course
[3258.48 → 3259.30] those times
[3259.30 → 3260.74] kind of near death
[3260.74 → 3262.18] are one time
[3262.18 → 3262.90] that we can feel
[3262.90 → 3263.26] small
[3263.26 → 3264.28] but there's so many
[3264.28 → 3265.26] other different instances
[3265.26 → 3266.18] it can be
[3266.18 → 3267.62] perhaps in a
[3267.62 → 3268.94] mental health crisis
[3268.94 → 3270.98] it can expose
[3270.98 → 3271.98] that we might not
[3271.98 → 3273.16] have as much control
[3273.16 → 3274.06] as we would like
[3274.06 → 3274.84] in our lives
[3274.84 → 3276.48] it can be
[3276.48 → 3277.20] uncertainty
[3277.20 → 3277.98] and in global
[3277.98 → 3278.52] politics
[3278.52 → 3279.18] and following
[3279.18 → 3279.76] the news
[3279.76 → 3280.40] and just seeing
[3280.40 → 3281.22] how quickly
[3281.22 → 3282.32] things can change
[3282.32 → 3283.14] in our world
[3283.14 → 3285.18] maybe there's
[3285.18 → 3286.12] fears around
[3286.12 → 3286.96] movements in our
[3286.96 → 3287.36] culture
[3287.36 → 3288.72] that make us
[3288.72 → 3289.24] feel kind of
[3289.24 → 3290.02] smaller or
[3290.02 → 3290.86] insignificant in the
[3290.86 → 3291.22] midst of it
[3291.22 → 3291.74] we have fears
[3291.74 → 3292.64] of how things
[3292.64 → 3293.28] are changing
[3293.28 → 3294.56] or maybe it's
[3294.56 → 3295.10] the other way
[3295.10 → 3295.90] around where
[3295.90 → 3297.30] you find yourself
[3297.30 → 3298.50] that you're changing
[3298.50 → 3300.16] and the people
[3300.16 → 3300.82] around you
[3300.82 → 3301.34] aren't
[3301.34 → 3302.06] they're not
[3302.06 → 3302.90] changing in the
[3302.90 → 3303.66] same way
[3303.66 → 3306.40] there's lots
[3306.40 → 3306.92] of things
[3306.92 → 3307.40] that can give
[3307.40 → 3308.64] us an unsettled
[3308.64 → 3309.36] feeling
[3309.36 → 3311.10] there's lots
[3311.10 → 3311.78] of things
[3311.78 → 3312.54] that can make
[3312.54 → 3313.24] us feel like
[3313.24 → 3314.06] we are stuck
[3314.06 → 3315.42] that we are
[3315.42 → 3316.10] entering into
[3316.10 → 3316.82] something that's
[3316.82 → 3317.24] unknown
[3317.24 → 3318.84] and in these
[3318.84 → 3319.18] moments
[3319.18 → 3319.90] it's nice
[3319.90 → 3320.56] to know
[3320.56 → 3322.40] that there is
[3322.40 → 3323.32] a shepherd
[3323.32 → 3327.40] and regardless
[3327.40 → 3328.02] of what puts
[3328.02 → 3328.42] us here
[3328.42 → 3329.12] regardless
[3329.12 → 3330.16] of what reminds
[3330.16 → 3330.86] us that we
[3330.86 → 3331.72] are like
[3331.72 → 3332.12] sheep
[3332.12 → 3336.56] we have
[3336.56 → 3338.16] this image
[3338.16 → 3340.92] there's comfort
[3340.92 → 3341.54] in knowing
[3341.54 → 3342.46] that there is
[3342.46 → 3343.30] someone in
[3343.30 → 3343.80] charge
[3343.80 → 3344.70] and Jesus
[3344.70 → 3345.62] gives this
[3345.62 → 3346.10] twice
[3346.10 → 3347.00] in our
[3347.00 → 3347.62] passage
[3347.62 → 3348.50] twice
[3348.50 → 3349.18] he says
[3349.18 → 3350.06] I am
[3350.06 → 3350.68] the good
[3350.68 → 3351.14] shepherd
[3351.14 → 3352.42] giving that
[3352.42 → 3352.96] emphasis
[3352.96 → 3354.94] that reminder
[3354.94 → 3356.02] that this
[3356.02 → 3356.64] is something
[3356.64 → 3357.10] true
[3357.10 → 3357.50] this is
[3357.50 → 3357.80] something
[3357.80 → 3358.26] true
[3358.26 → 3359.00] about
[3359.00 → 3359.50] him
[3359.50 → 3360.90] he wants
[3360.90 → 3361.20] us to
[3361.20 → 3361.38] know
[3361.38 → 3361.68] that it's
[3361.68 → 3362.00] not just
[3362.00 → 3362.60] wishful
[3362.60 → 3363.16] thinking
[3363.16 → 3365.14] that
[3365.14 → 3365.74] is who
[3365.74 → 3366.62] he is
[3366.62 → 3368.32] and we
[3368.32 → 3368.92] take comfort
[3368.92 → 3369.36] in this
[3369.36 → 3369.84] image
[3369.84 → 3371.36] because God
[3371.36 → 3372.42] also gives
[3372.42 → 3372.96] that image
[3372.96 → 3373.66] of himself
[3373.66 → 3374.40] that God
[3374.40 → 3375.22] is the one
[3375.22 → 3375.94] who is
[3375.94 → 3376.72] that good
[3376.72 → 3377.04] shepherd
[3377.04 → 3377.88] whether it's
[3377.88 → 3378.70] from Psalm
[3378.70 → 3379.60] 23 or
[3379.60 → 3380.60] where we'll
[3380.60 → 3381.20] see in a
[3381.20 → 3381.86] moment from
[3381.86 → 3382.84] Ezekiel 34
[3382.84 → 3384.20] God promises
[3384.20 → 3384.98] to be
[3384.98 → 3386.12] that good
[3386.12 → 3386.62] shepherd
[3386.62 → 3387.50] for us
[3387.50 → 3389.58] and we
[3389.58 → 3389.84] can be
[3389.84 → 3390.18] reminded
[3390.18 → 3390.52] that as
[3390.52 → 3391.04] big of
[3391.04 → 3391.48] a gap
[3391.48 → 3392.00] as there
[3392.00 → 3392.68] is between
[3392.68 → 3393.38] sheep and
[3393.38 → 3393.84] a shepherd
[3393.84 → 3395.36] there's an
[3395.36 → 3396.14] even bigger
[3396.14 → 3397.24] gap between
[3397.24 → 3398.04] ourselves
[3398.04 → 3399.10] and God
[3399.10 → 3399.74] that God
[3399.74 → 3400.28] is kind of
[3400.28 → 3401.32] infinitely more
[3401.32 → 3402.52] capable of
[3402.52 → 3403.56] guiding us
[3403.56 → 3407.62] now Jesus'
[3407.84 → 3408.52] statement of
[3408.52 → 3409.24] being a good
[3409.24 → 3410.76] shepherd adds
[3410.76 → 3411.48] in that word
[3411.48 → 3413.24] good and
[3413.24 → 3414.20] that is there
[3414.20 → 3415.42] to remind us
[3415.42 → 3415.84] that there
[3415.84 → 3416.48] are not
[3416.48 → 3417.48] good shepherds
[3417.48 → 3417.94] around
[3417.94 → 3419.46] and we
[3419.46 → 3420.12] could see
[3420.12 → 3420.66] an example
[3420.66 → 3421.00] of that
[3421.00 → 3421.34] if we were
[3421.34 → 3421.80] to read
[3421.80 → 3422.40] the whole
[3422.40 → 3423.60] of chapter
[3423.60 → 3424.28] nine of
[3424.28 → 3424.70] John
[3424.70 → 3426.04] I kind of
[3426.04 → 3426.54] pointed out
[3426.54 → 3426.94] earlier
[3426.94 → 3427.82] there's this
[3427.82 → 3428.30] instance
[3428.30 → 3429.60] Jesus heals
[3429.60 → 3430.42] someone who
[3430.42 → 3431.50] is blind
[3431.50 → 3432.58] and the
[3432.58 → 3433.38] problem with
[3433.38 → 3433.98] that is that
[3433.98 → 3434.44] he does it
[3434.44 → 3434.68] on the
[3434.68 → 3434.98] Sabbath
[3434.98 → 3435.26] and the
[3435.26 → 3435.70] religious
[3435.70 → 3436.18] leaders
[3436.18 → 3436.94] don't like
[3436.94 → 3437.30] that
[3437.30 → 3438.14] so when
[3438.14 → 3438.44] they try
[3438.44 → 3438.94] to correct
[3438.94 → 3439.10] it
[3439.10 → 3439.34] when they
[3439.34 → 3439.88] confront
[3439.88 → 3440.46] him on
[3440.46 → 3440.62] it
[3440.62 → 3441.34] they end
[3441.34 → 3441.64] up
[3441.64 → 3442.72] acting
[3442.72 → 3443.30] like
[3443.30 → 3444.64] not
[3444.64 → 3444.98] good
[3444.98 → 3445.66] shepherds
[3445.66 → 3446.04] they end
[3446.04 → 3446.28] up
[3446.28 → 3446.88] kicking
[3446.88 → 3447.20] this
[3447.20 → 3447.52] person
[3447.52 → 3447.76] out
[3447.76 → 3447.96] who
[3447.96 → 3448.16] was
[3448.16 → 3448.46] healed
[3448.46 → 3448.66] which
[3448.66 → 3448.76] was
[3448.76 → 3448.90] the
[3448.90 → 3449.30] opposite
[3449.30 → 3449.62] of what
[3449.62 → 3449.80] you would
[3449.80 → 3450.20] expect
[3450.20 → 3450.58] from someone
[3450.58 → 3450.78] that's
[3450.78 → 3451.04] healed
[3451.04 → 3452.18] when someone
[3452.18 → 3452.48] was kind
[3452.48 → 3452.68] of an
[3452.68 → 3453.24] outcast
[3453.24 → 3453.68] because
[3453.68 → 3454.66] of a
[3454.66 → 3455.06] sickness
[3455.06 → 3455.80] of sorts
[3455.80 → 3456.80] when they
[3456.80 → 3457.26] get healed
[3457.26 → 3457.96] they're supposed
[3457.96 → 3458.96] to be re-entered
[3458.96 → 3459.84] into community
[3459.84 → 3461.00] but the opposite
[3461.00 → 3462.24] takes place
[3462.24 → 3462.58] here
[3462.58 → 3464.00] they're removed
[3464.00 → 3464.60] from it
[3464.60 → 3466.18] as we saw
[3466.18 → 3467.04] in verse 34
[3467.04 → 3467.94] they threw
[3467.94 → 3468.60] him out
[3468.60 → 3472.00] and we
[3472.00 → 3472.66] find that
[3472.66 → 3473.56] the Pharisees
[3473.56 → 3474.22] the religious
[3474.22 → 3474.92] shepherds
[3474.92 → 3475.42] of Israel
[3475.42 → 3475.82] are people
[3475.82 → 3476.24] that have
[3476.24 → 3476.80] it wrong
[3476.80 → 3478.50] they're kind
[3478.50 → 3479.56] of being
[3479.56 → 3480.68] these gatekeepers
[3480.68 → 3482.50] saying
[3482.50 → 3483.84] we are the
[3483.84 → 3484.50] ones who decide
[3484.50 → 3485.10] who is in
[3485.10 → 3485.68] and out
[3485.68 → 3486.58] and they're
[3486.58 → 3487.50] acting like
[3487.50 → 3490.28] what the
[3490.28 → 3491.16] description is
[3491.16 → 3491.70] of the religious
[3491.70 → 3492.30] leaders in
[3492.30 → 3493.38] Ezekiel 34
[3493.38 → 3494.48] and I know
[3494.48 → 3495.68] when we think
[3495.68 → 3496.22] of the shepherd
[3496.22 → 3496.64] imagery
[3496.64 → 3497.94] we probably
[3497.94 → 3498.64] first think
[3498.64 → 3499.32] of Psalm 23
[3499.32 → 3500.04] because that's
[3500.04 → 3500.36] the most
[3500.36 → 3500.90] familiar
[3500.90 → 3501.50] of our
[3501.50 → 3501.96] passages
[3501.96 → 3502.56] but if
[3502.56 → 3503.10] you look
[3503.10 → 3503.40] at the
[3503.40 → 3503.60] people
[3503.60 → 3504.06] that really
[3504.06 → 3504.56] spend a lot
[3504.56 → 3504.90] of time
[3504.90 → 3505.46] with John
[3505.46 → 3507.14] they often
[3507.14 → 3507.80] say this is
[3507.80 → 3509.16] actually referencing
[3509.16 → 3510.90] Ezekiel 34
[3510.90 → 3511.88] a lot more
[3511.88 → 3512.50] closely
[3512.50 → 3513.48] and it fits
[3513.48 → 3514.00] within the
[3514.00 → 3514.32] narrative
[3514.32 → 3514.82] it fits
[3514.82 → 3515.80] within that
[3515.80 → 3516.52] follow through
[3516.52 → 3517.18] from that
[3517.18 → 3518.00] context of
[3518.00 → 3518.66] John chapter
[3518.66 → 3519.08] 9
[3519.08 → 3523.08] so to
[3523.08 → 3523.78] look at
[3523.78 → 3525.04] Ezekiel 34
[3525.04 → 3526.00] for just a
[3526.00 → 3526.36] moment
[3526.36 → 3527.12] to hear
[3527.12 → 3528.06] these words
[3528.06 → 3528.78] in this
[3528.78 → 3529.48] context
[3529.48 → 3531.34] we have
[3531.34 → 3532.10] God saying
[3532.10 → 3533.28] this is
[3533.28 → 3533.68] what the
[3533.68 → 3534.04] sovereign
[3534.04 → 3534.88] Lord says
[3534.88 → 3536.84] woe to
[3536.84 → 3537.08] you
[3537.08 → 3537.72] shepherds
[3537.72 → 3538.44] of Israel
[3538.44 → 3539.04] who only
[3539.04 → 3539.58] take care
[3539.58 → 3540.22] of yourselves
[3540.22 → 3541.86] should not
[3541.86 → 3542.66] the shepherds
[3542.66 → 3543.22] take care
[3543.22 → 3543.54] of the
[3543.54 → 3543.98] flock
[3543.98 → 3546.10] so that
[3546.10 → 3546.68] the religious
[3546.68 → 3547.42] leaders of
[3547.42 → 3547.60] the day
[3547.60 → 3548.08] aren't doing
[3548.08 → 3548.60] their job
[3548.60 → 3548.94] of taking
[3548.94 → 3549.26] care of
[3549.26 → 3549.66] the flock
[3549.66 → 3550.04] well what
[3550.04 → 3550.28] are they
[3550.28 → 3550.60] doing
[3550.60 → 3550.96] they
[3550.96 → 3551.18] says
[3551.18 → 3551.70] you eat
[3551.70 → 3552.38] the curds
[3552.38 → 3552.60] and you
[3552.60 → 3553.00] clothe
[3553.00 → 3553.52] yourselves
[3553.52 → 3553.88] with the
[3553.88 → 3554.16] wool
[3554.16 → 3554.78] and slaughter
[3554.78 → 3555.28] the choice
[3555.28 → 3555.74] animals
[3555.74 → 3556.08] but you
[3556.08 → 3556.34] don't
[3556.34 → 3556.66] take care
[3556.66 → 3556.88] of the
[3556.88 → 3557.12] flock
[3557.12 → 3557.52] so there's
[3557.52 → 3558.00] a self
[3558.00 → 3558.58] interest
[3558.58 → 3559.38] that they
[3559.38 → 3559.86] have
[3559.86 → 3560.96] in contrast
[3560.96 → 3561.52] to what
[3561.52 → 3561.74] they're
[3561.74 → 3562.36] supposed to
[3562.36 → 3563.26] be doing
[3563.26 → 3564.14] but more
[3564.14 → 3564.72] than that
[3564.72 → 3565.40] it says
[3565.40 → 3566.04] in verse 4
[3566.04 → 3566.38] you have
[3566.38 → 3567.20] not strengthened
[3567.20 → 3567.80] the weak
[3567.80 → 3568.48] or healed
[3568.48 → 3569.04] the sick
[3569.04 → 3569.68] or bound
[3569.68 → 3570.32] the injured
[3570.32 → 3570.78] you have
[3570.78 → 3571.64] not brought
[3571.64 → 3572.18] back
[3572.18 → 3573.20] the strays
[3573.20 → 3573.76] or even
[3573.76 → 3574.26] searched
[3574.26 → 3574.66] for the
[3574.66 → 3575.04] lost
[3575.04 → 3575.94] you have
[3575.94 → 3576.36] ruled them
[3576.36 → 3576.96] harshly
[3576.96 → 3577.48] and brutally
[3577.48 → 3578.20] so this
[3578.20 → 3579.18] act of
[3579.18 → 3579.64] caring
[3579.64 → 3580.30] of going
[3580.30 → 3580.68] out
[3580.68 → 3581.58] and seeking
[3581.58 → 3582.32] the lost
[3582.32 → 3583.86] of bandaging
[3583.86 → 3584.42] the sick
[3584.42 → 3585.90] this is
[3585.90 → 3586.26] what they
[3586.26 → 3586.70] were called
[3586.70 → 3587.22] to do
[3587.22 → 3588.40] and they
[3588.40 → 3588.80] weren't
[3588.80 → 3589.50] doing it
[3589.50 → 3592.64] it's no
[3592.64 → 3593.20] mistake
[3593.20 → 3594.04] that Jesus
[3594.04 → 3594.72] picks up
[3594.72 → 3595.28] shepherd
[3595.28 → 3596.00] sheep and
[3596.00 → 3596.32] shepherd
[3596.32 → 3596.88] imagery
[3596.88 → 3598.04] right after
[3598.04 → 3598.76] the story
[3598.76 → 3599.46] of the
[3599.46 → 3599.82] religious
[3599.82 → 3600.46] leaders
[3600.46 → 3602.16] ruling
[3602.16 → 3603.02] harshly
[3603.02 → 3603.70] perhaps
[3603.70 → 3604.24] brutally
[3604.24 → 3606.90] and you
[3606.90 → 3607.30] can read
[3607.30 → 3607.88] the full
[3607.88 → 3609.36] chapter
[3609.36 → 3611.02] to get
[3611.02 → 3611.36] the bigger
[3611.36 → 3611.78] picture
[3611.78 → 3612.32] but I
[3612.32 → 3612.54] think
[3612.54 → 3612.80] one of
[3612.80 → 3613.26] the key
[3613.26 → 3613.68] verses
[3613.68 → 3614.62] is
[3614.62 → 3615.86] verse 11
[3615.86 → 3616.64] one of
[3616.64 → 3617.30] the reasons
[3617.30 → 3617.88] why this
[3617.88 → 3618.22] would have
[3618.22 → 3618.56] been on
[3618.56 → 3618.94] the minds
[3618.94 → 3619.14] of the
[3619.14 → 3619.34] Jewish
[3619.34 → 3619.62] people
[3619.62 → 3619.94] is because
[3619.94 → 3620.28] of a
[3620.28 → 3620.76] promise
[3620.76 → 3621.10] that's
[3621.10 → 3621.60] embedded
[3621.60 → 3622.40] into this
[3622.40 → 3622.74] passage
[3622.74 → 3623.16] it's not
[3623.16 → 3623.54] just an
[3623.54 → 3624.08] indictment
[3624.08 → 3624.66] against the
[3624.66 → 3624.94] religious
[3624.94 → 3625.22] leaders
[3625.22 → 3625.44] of the
[3625.44 → 3625.68] day
[3625.68 → 3626.28] but there's
[3626.28 → 3626.86] a promise
[3626.86 → 3627.38] in here
[3627.38 → 3627.88] and the
[3627.88 → 3628.32] promise
[3628.32 → 3628.90] is
[3628.90 → 3630.86] this is
[3630.86 → 3631.26] what the
[3631.26 → 3631.70] sovereign
[3631.70 → 3632.52] lord says
[3632.52 → 3633.82] I myself
[3633.82 → 3634.48] will search
[3634.48 → 3634.96] for my
[3634.96 → 3635.30] sheep
[3635.30 → 3635.78] and look
[3635.78 → 3636.50] after them
[3636.50 → 3638.22] there's a
[3638.22 → 3638.68] promise
[3638.68 → 3639.32] that God
[3639.32 → 3639.70] himself
[3639.70 → 3640.36] would be
[3640.36 → 3640.78] the sheep
[3640.78 → 3641.24] that God
[3641.24 → 3641.90] himself
[3641.90 → 3643.10] would do
[3643.10 → 3643.72] that work
[3643.72 → 3644.52] of caring
[3644.52 → 3644.98] for his
[3644.98 → 3645.28] people
[3645.28 → 3645.64] so the
[3645.64 → 3645.96] people
[3645.96 → 3646.96] are anticipating
[3646.96 → 3647.68] a time
[3647.68 → 3648.30] where God
[3648.30 → 3648.56] will be
[3648.56 → 3648.92] present
[3648.92 → 3649.54] where God
[3649.54 → 3650.06] will be
[3650.06 → 3650.68] the shepherd
[3650.68 → 3653.64] so when
[3653.64 → 3654.42] Jesus picks
[3654.42 → 3654.76] up the
[3654.76 → 3655.34] language of
[3655.34 → 3656.06] shepherd here
[3656.06 → 3657.80] right after
[3657.80 → 3658.30] the shepherds
[3658.30 → 3658.82] of the day
[3658.82 → 3659.42] show that
[3659.42 → 3659.88] they're not
[3659.88 → 3660.34] caring for
[3660.34 → 3660.82] the flock
[3660.82 → 3661.50] it's a
[3661.50 → 3662.64] very loaded
[3662.64 → 3663.22] statement
[3663.22 → 3665.42] he's essentially
[3665.42 → 3665.92] saying
[3665.92 → 3667.34] you leaders
[3667.34 → 3668.46] are acting
[3668.46 → 3668.90] like the
[3668.90 → 3669.52] leaders of
[3669.52 → 3669.96] old
[3669.96 → 3671.04] you're no
[3671.04 → 3671.48] different from
[3671.48 → 3671.90] the ones that
[3671.90 → 3672.38] came before
[3672.38 → 3672.78] you who
[3672.78 → 3673.28] missed the
[3673.28 → 3673.60] point
[3673.60 → 3673.94] you are
[3673.94 → 3674.46] shepherds
[3674.46 → 3675.08] who are only
[3675.08 → 3676.10] interested in
[3676.10 → 3676.66] yourselves
[3676.66 → 3677.28] your self
[3677.28 → 3677.86] preservation
[3677.86 → 3679.06] you're kicking
[3679.06 → 3679.54] out someone
[3679.54 → 3679.88] from the
[3679.88 → 3680.24] flock
[3680.24 → 3680.84] for what
[3680.84 → 3682.12] for being
[3682.12 → 3682.64] healed
[3682.64 → 3683.54] because he
[3683.54 → 3684.16] believes in
[3684.16 → 3684.46] the one
[3684.46 → 3685.02] who healed
[3685.02 → 3685.30] him
[3685.30 → 3687.66] he's saying
[3687.66 → 3688.04] to the
[3688.04 → 3688.78] Pharisees
[3688.78 → 3689.86] remember
[3689.86 → 3690.58] what God
[3690.58 → 3691.26] promised
[3691.26 → 3693.48] that he
[3693.48 → 3694.26] would come
[3694.26 → 3695.14] and shepherd
[3695.14 → 3695.76] his people
[3695.76 → 3696.14] that he
[3696.14 → 3696.52] would be
[3696.52 → 3697.02] the true
[3697.02 → 3697.50] shepherd
[3697.50 → 3698.82] well I
[3698.82 → 3699.44] am
[3699.44 → 3700.56] the shepherd
[3700.56 → 3701.72] you throw
[3701.72 → 3702.20] people out
[3702.20 → 3702.66] you send
[3702.66 → 3703.18] them away
[3703.18 → 3703.96] to get
[3703.96 → 3704.38] snatched
[3704.38 → 3704.78] by the
[3704.78 → 3705.12] wolves
[3705.12 → 3705.58] but not
[3705.58 → 3705.88] me
[3705.88 → 3706.62] those who
[3706.62 → 3706.96] come to
[3706.96 → 3707.22] me
[3707.22 → 3707.56] are
[3707.56 → 3708.16] completely
[3708.16 → 3708.78] secure
[3708.78 → 3709.72] they'll
[3709.72 → 3710.34] never be
[3710.34 → 3710.78] snatched
[3710.78 → 3711.24] away
[3711.24 → 3713.26] and I
[3713.26 → 3713.78] think that's
[3713.78 → 3714.46] an important
[3714.46 → 3715.28] image for
[3715.28 → 3715.98] us to
[3715.98 → 3716.32] capture
[3716.32 → 3716.66] when we
[3716.66 → 3717.30] read this
[3717.30 → 3717.90] passage
[3717.90 → 3719.78] that whatever
[3719.78 → 3720.46] our picture
[3720.46 → 3721.16] of whom
[3721.16 → 3722.08] God is
[3722.08 → 3723.14] needs to
[3723.14 → 3723.94] be informed
[3723.94 → 3724.86] by John
[3724.86 → 3725.54] chapter 10
[3725.54 → 3726.36] of God
[3726.36 → 3727.54] being the
[3727.54 → 3727.86] shepherd
[3727.86 → 3728.58] of God
[3728.58 → 3729.00] being the
[3729.00 → 3729.62] one who
[3729.62 → 3730.54] longs to
[3730.54 → 3731.12] reach out
[3731.12 → 3731.82] for those
[3731.82 → 3732.50] who actually
[3732.50 → 3733.68] searches for
[3733.68 → 3734.74] the lost
[3734.74 → 3735.34] and brings
[3735.34 → 3735.86] them home
[3735.86 → 3736.74] that bandages
[3736.74 → 3737.16] them
[3737.16 → 3741.12] earlier in
[3741.12 → 3741.70] the passage
[3741.70 → 3742.30] if we
[3742.30 → 3742.82] look at
[3742.82 → 3744.76] John 10
[3744.76 → 3745.62] verse 3
[3745.62 → 3746.80] there's also
[3746.80 → 3747.20] a big
[3747.20 → 3747.64] emphasis
[3747.64 → 3749.52] on the
[3749.52 → 3749.82] sheep
[3749.82 → 3751.24] and what
[3751.24 → 3751.76] the sheep
[3751.76 → 3752.50] are doing
[3752.50 → 3752.96] here and
[3752.96 → 3753.34] it says
[3753.34 → 3754.02] in verse
[3754.02 → 3754.44] 3
[3754.44 → 3755.90] the gate
[3755.90 → 3756.40] keeper
[3756.40 → 3756.90] opens the
[3756.90 → 3757.26] gate for
[3757.26 → 3757.56] him and
[3757.56 → 3758.06] the sheep
[3758.06 → 3759.48] listen to
[3759.48 → 3760.32] his voice
[3760.32 → 3761.74] there's this
[3761.74 → 3762.56] listening
[3762.56 → 3763.28] emphasis
[3763.28 → 3764.12] in here
[3764.12 → 3765.74] he calls
[3765.74 → 3766.18] the sheep
[3766.18 → 3766.78] by name
[3766.78 → 3767.32] and leads
[3767.32 → 3767.88] them out
[3767.88 → 3769.88] and when
[3769.88 → 3770.42] he has
[3770.42 → 3771.06] brought them
[3771.06 → 3772.12] out all
[3772.12 → 3772.54] on his
[3772.54 → 3772.94] own
[3772.94 → 3774.38] he goes
[3774.38 → 3775.06] on ahead
[3775.06 → 3775.48] of them
[3775.48 → 3776.60] and the
[3776.60 → 3777.40] sheep follow
[3777.40 → 3778.22] him because
[3778.22 → 3779.44] they know
[3779.44 → 3780.74] his voice
[3780.74 → 3786.24] now
[3786.24 → 3790.14] knowing the
[3790.14 → 3790.70] good shepherd
[3790.70 → 3791.56] here is an
[3791.56 → 3792.52] important thing
[3792.52 → 3794.26] but also
[3794.26 → 3797.64] to know
[3797.64 → 3798.60] in the
[3798.60 → 3798.84] biblical
[3798.84 → 3799.60] context
[3799.60 → 3801.26] I said
[3801.26 → 3801.56] earlier
[3801.56 → 3802.28] we don't
[3802.28 → 3802.74] necessarily
[3802.74 → 3803.32] know too
[3803.32 → 3803.68] many
[3803.68 → 3804.80] shepherds
[3804.80 → 3805.68] and if we
[3805.68 → 3806.00] do it's
[3806.00 → 3806.36] probably a
[3806.36 → 3806.66] little bit
[3806.66 → 3807.32] different from
[3807.32 → 3808.28] what shepherding
[3808.28 → 3808.92] looked like
[3808.92 → 3809.90] back in the
[3809.90 → 3810.18] day
[3810.18 → 3811.64] maybe some
[3811.64 → 3811.86] of our
[3811.86 → 3812.76] pictures of
[3812.76 → 3813.48] sheep and
[3813.48 → 3813.86] shepherd
[3813.86 → 3814.54] we kind of
[3814.54 → 3815.12] think to
[3815.12 → 3816.80] what might
[3816.80 → 3817.46] be out there
[3817.46 → 3818.16] in other
[3818.16 → 3818.98] areas where
[3818.98 → 3819.30] you have
[3819.30 → 3819.60] like the
[3819.60 → 3820.22] sheepdogs
[3820.22 → 3820.62] and they
[3820.62 → 3821.66] corral the
[3821.66 → 3822.02] sheep by
[3822.02 → 3822.72] going behind
[3822.72 → 3823.82] and pointing
[3823.82 → 3824.14] them in
[3824.14 → 3824.64] directions
[3824.64 → 3825.32] that way
[3825.32 → 3826.22] but that's
[3826.22 → 3826.72] not the
[3826.72 → 3827.50] way that
[3827.50 → 3827.96] shepherding
[3827.96 → 3829.12] worked in
[3829.12 → 3829.38] the Middle
[3829.38 → 3829.74] East or
[3829.74 → 3831.14] still works
[3831.14 → 3831.70] that way
[3831.70 → 3833.16] when I
[3833.16 → 3833.84] lived in
[3833.84 → 3834.62] Israel for
[3834.62 → 3835.44] a time
[3835.44 → 3835.86] we would
[3835.86 → 3836.50] come across
[3836.50 → 3837.22] shepherds
[3837.22 → 3838.08] and I
[3838.08 → 3838.54] remember one
[3838.54 → 3839.32] conversation that
[3839.32 → 3839.84] we had with
[3839.84 → 3840.78] one of just
[3840.78 → 3841.38] asking what
[3841.38 → 3841.90] is the
[3841.90 → 3842.32] relationship
[3842.32 → 3843.12] with the
[3843.12 → 3843.58] sheep like
[3843.58 → 3845.06] what can
[3845.06 → 3845.58] you tell us
[3845.58 → 3846.06] about these
[3846.06 → 3846.30] well he
[3846.30 → 3846.70] could tell
[3846.70 → 3847.70] us that he
[3847.70 → 3848.16] had some of
[3848.16 → 3848.68] his favourite
[3848.68 → 3849.40] sheep he
[3849.40 → 3849.76] knew which
[3849.76 → 3850.10] sheep were
[3850.10 → 3850.48] the leader
[3850.48 → 3851.50] ones and
[3851.50 → 3851.72] he could
[3851.72 → 3852.04] demonstrate
[3852.04 → 3852.46] that by
[3852.46 → 3852.88] calling he
[3852.88 → 3853.12] could say
[3853.12 → 3853.52] okay that
[3853.52 → 3853.90] sheep over
[3853.90 → 3854.56] there I'll
[3854.56 → 3855.02] call that
[3855.02 → 3855.62] one's name
[3855.62 → 3856.24] and it will
[3856.24 → 3856.84] come to me
[3856.84 → 3857.28] and that
[3857.28 → 3857.62] one over
[3857.62 → 3858.00] there well
[3858.00 → 3858.38] that one's
[3858.38 → 3858.76] the leader
[3858.76 → 3859.54] sheep so
[3859.54 → 3859.96] if I call
[3859.96 → 3860.28] that one
[3860.28 → 3860.66] to me I
[3860.66 → 3861.08] know other
[3861.08 → 3861.56] ones will
[3861.56 → 3862.14] follow so
[3862.14 → 3862.48] it can be
[3862.48 → 3862.98] helpful if
[3862.98 → 3863.20] we have
[3863.20 → 3863.70] some stubborn
[3863.70 → 3864.98] sheep to
[3864.98 → 3865.44] know which
[3865.44 → 3866.22] ones to
[3866.22 → 3867.52] kind of call
[3867.52 → 3868.10] by name
[3868.10 → 3869.64] and one of
[3869.64 → 3870.14] the interesting
[3870.14 → 3871.16] things about
[3871.16 → 3872.50] sheep listening
[3872.50 → 3872.90] when they
[3872.90 → 3874.08] call is that
[3874.08 → 3874.68] it's not an
[3874.68 → 3875.22] image of
[3875.22 → 3876.02] pushing from
[3876.02 → 3877.48] behind but
[3877.48 → 3878.24] the shepherd has
[3878.24 → 3879.12] to go ahead
[3879.12 → 3879.54] of the
[3879.54 → 3880.08] sheep and
[3880.08 → 3881.24] sheep for
[3881.24 → 3881.88] them to be
[3881.88 → 3882.50] able to
[3882.50 → 3883.12] follow where
[3883.12 → 3883.90] they're going
[3883.90 → 3886.10] this is
[3886.10 → 3886.80] something that
[3886.80 → 3887.20] could kind of
[3887.20 → 3887.84] famously be
[3887.84 → 3888.84] demonstrated in
[3888.84 → 3889.68] the sheep pens
[3889.68 → 3891.38] there if you
[3891.38 → 3892.02] wanted to make
[3892.02 → 3892.46] sure that your
[3892.46 → 3893.06] sheep were taken
[3893.06 → 3893.62] care of for the
[3893.62 → 3894.62] night it didn't
[3894.62 → 3895.62] matter if you
[3895.62 → 3896.34] just threw them
[3896.34 → 3897.54] in this big pen
[3897.54 → 3899.28] with flocks from
[3899.28 → 3900.06] many other
[3900.06 → 3901.50] shepherds because
[3901.50 → 3902.04] you didn't have to
[3902.04 → 3902.68] worry about sorting
[3902.68 → 3903.32] out which sheep
[3903.32 → 3903.98] were yours all
[3903.98 → 3904.56] you'd have to do
[3904.56 → 3905.12] is step out of
[3905.12 → 3905.94] the pen and
[3905.94 → 3907.62] call the names
[3907.62 → 3908.46] for your sheep and
[3908.46 → 3909.08] they would all
[3909.08 → 3909.96] just come out
[3909.96 → 3911.00] naturally you
[3911.00 → 3911.56] wouldn't have to
[3911.56 → 3912.28] have little extra
[3912.28 → 3913.10] dividers the
[3913.10 → 3914.78] sheep know the
[3914.78 → 3915.90] shepherd's voice
[3915.90 → 3920.18] and it doesn't
[3920.18 → 3920.92] just stop with
[3920.92 → 3921.88] being in the pen
[3921.88 → 3922.58] of course that
[3922.58 → 3924.04] pattern happens the
[3924.04 → 3925.64] whole day that the
[3925.64 → 3926.48] sheep are always
[3926.48 → 3927.46] following the
[3927.46 → 3928.58] shepherd so to
[3928.58 → 3930.20] have this in our
[3930.20 → 3931.64] imagery here we
[3931.64 → 3933.54] got the sheep and
[3933.54 → 3935.58] if there's something
[3935.58 → 3937.22] chaotic going on in
[3937.22 → 3938.04] front of the sheep
[3938.04 → 3939.26] we don't have the
[3939.26 → 3941.10] shepherd coming from
[3941.10 → 3942.04] behind and saying
[3942.04 → 3943.30] I go into the
[3943.30 → 3944.32] chaos go into that
[3944.32 → 3946.74] uncertain place what
[3946.74 → 3948.72] we have is the image
[3948.72 → 3950.48] of the shepherd that
[3950.48 → 3953.34] invites the sheep to
[3953.34 → 3955.56] come to come where he
[3955.56 → 3958.40] already is, and I like
[3958.40 → 3960.20] this image not just
[3960.20 → 3962.18] because I drew it but
[3962.18 → 3963.52] because I think it
[3963.52 → 3965.94] gives a good picture of
[3965.94 → 3967.40] how we can find some
[3967.40 → 3968.44] encouragement in this
[3968.44 → 3970.48] passage notice that in
[3970.48 → 3971.94] this context that the
[3971.94 → 3973.50] chaos the messiness of
[3973.50 → 3974.08] life doesn't
[3974.08 → 3975.22] necessarily disappear
[3975.22 → 3978.76] what happens here is
[3978.76 → 3980.24] that the shepherd is
[3980.24 → 3981.52] present in it what
[3981.52 → 3982.50] gives the sheep the
[3982.50 → 3983.56] confidence to go up
[3983.56 → 3984.50] there isn't that they
[3984.50 → 3985.58] have a shepherd behind
[3985.58 → 3986.60] them pushing them to
[3986.60 → 3988.10] go, but the shepherd is
[3988.10 → 3990.68] present it's inviting them
[3990.68 → 3992.14] to go into something
[3992.14 → 3994.30] that is already known
[3994.30 → 3998.56] my sheep listen to my
[3998.56 → 4000.90] voice I know them and
[4000.90 → 4003.54] they follow me Jesus
[4003.54 → 4007.10] says the shepherd does
[4007.10 → 4008.52] not and will not call us
[4008.52 → 4009.82] to a place where he has
[4009.82 → 4013.12] not already been we can
[4013.12 → 4014.88] walk we can move ahead
[4014.88 → 4016.44] with confidence knowing
[4016.44 → 4017.78] that the shepherd doesn't
[4017.78 → 4019.32] just tell us to blindly
[4019.32 → 4020.94] push ourselves into the
[4020.94 → 4022.46] unknown instead the
[4022.46 → 4024.54] shepherd is present in
[4024.54 → 4025.74] the places that might
[4025.74 → 4027.84] seem or might feel very
[4027.84 → 4029.18] uncertain for you
[4029.18 → 4033.00] now this extends into
[4033.00 → 4034.16] everything this extends
[4034.16 → 4036.24] even into death
[4036.24 → 4038.28] Jesus is the one who has
[4038.28 → 4039.52] gone ahead of us who has
[4039.52 → 4040.56] died who has conquered
[4040.56 → 4042.76] death what is unknown to
[4042.76 → 4044.02] us is something that is
[4044.02 → 4045.30] certain for him
[4045.30 → 4049.36] as sheep of the good
[4049.36 → 4051.04] shepherd we are free to
[4051.04 → 4053.90] wander ahead wander towards
[4053.90 → 4055.28] him with full confidence
[4055.28 → 4057.80] that God has things in
[4057.80 → 4059.74] control that regardless of
[4059.74 → 4060.88] how things may appear
[4060.88 → 4063.78] regardless of how it might
[4063.78 → 4065.18] appear that something else is
[4065.18 → 4067.98] in charge that we will in
[4067.98 → 4070.18] fact never be snatched away
[4070.18 → 4074.38] now we might think if it's
[4074.38 → 4075.60] kind of up to us the
[4075.60 → 4076.64] strength of the sheep that
[4076.64 → 4077.60] that maybe we're not strong
[4078.22 → 4080.52] enough that we haven't done
[4080.52 → 4081.68] enough that we don't have
[4081.68 → 4082.82] enough certainty enough
[4082.82 → 4083.74] conviction
[4083.74 → 4087.22] but what's interested in this
[4087.22 → 4088.68] passage is that the emphasis
[4088.68 → 4090.66] is not on the sheep or their
[4090.66 → 4091.60] abilities
[4091.60 → 4095.06] it points towards simply
[4095.06 → 4097.10] knowing the shepherd's voice
[4097.10 → 4100.90] are the sheep able to
[4100.90 → 4102.46] identify are they familiar
[4102.46 → 4105.66] enough with the one who is
[4105.66 → 4106.48] the good shepherd
[4106.48 → 4112.10] now Jesus gives this assurance
[4112.10 → 4114.58] for those who are feeling
[4114.58 → 4117.90] vulnerable for us sheep
[4117.90 → 4123.60] in chapter 10 he notes no one
[4123.60 → 4126.30] can snatch them from my hand
[4126.30 → 4129.24] we can think of this no one
[4129.24 → 4131.70] we can think of I think Paul
[4131.70 → 4134.58] in Romans chapter 8 maybe
[4134.58 → 4136.36] reflecting on Jesus's
[4136.36 → 4138.18] words of the security that we
[4138.18 → 4139.88] have in Christ that no one or
[4139.88 → 4141.30] nothing can separate us from
[4141.30 → 4143.60] him and how he just extends
[4143.60 → 4146.04] that Paul kind of goes on his
[4146.04 → 4148.10] own ideas they're saying that
[4148.10 → 4149.22] nothing can separate us from
[4149.22 → 4150.32] the love of God that is in
[4150.32 → 4152.46] Christ Jesus no height or depth
[4152.46 → 4155.90] no power no authority or anything
[4155.90 → 4157.78] can get between you and Jesus
[4157.78 → 4161.86] this image I think I have it
[4161.86 → 4163.60] written down here no one can
[4163.60 → 4166.76] snatch me from his hand it's an
[4166.76 → 4170.62] intensely personal image it's one
[4170.62 → 4174.52] of being close it's not just that
[4174.52 → 4176.64] you are guarded, but you are in his
[4176.64 → 4179.26] hand you are held and protected and
[4179.26 → 4183.98] secure in the hands of Christ and
[4183.98 → 4186.52] and when we look at where does
[4186.52 → 4188.76] where's Jesus coming from to make
[4188.76 → 4192.12] this level of statement what gives
[4192.12 → 4195.36] him this sort of authority well
[4195.36 → 4198.04] because being held in Jesus hands is
[4198.04 → 4201.26] one and the same of being held in
[4201.26 → 4204.94] God's hands and this is something you
[4204.94 → 4206.86] see over and over again in the gospel
[4206.86 → 4209.16] of John when you read it and as a whole
[4209.16 → 4211.92] just how closely Jesus will say one
[4211.92 → 4213.70] thing about himself and then say the
[4213.70 → 4217.00] next line the very same thing about
[4217.00 → 4219.60] God and this happens in this passage
[4219.60 → 4221.58] where he talks about how no one can
[4221.58 → 4223.96] snatch me from my hand or from the
[4223.96 → 4227.86] father's hands and in case it's not
[4227.86 → 4230.36] clear that he is one who is identifying
[4230.36 → 4232.92] himself completely with God he says I
[4232.92 → 4236.04] and the father are one he wants to
[4236.04 → 4238.32] make it abundantly clear that he is God
[4238.32 → 4242.38] finally come find finally come as the
[4242.38 → 4245.98] shepherd who was promised to do away
[4245.98 → 4247.84] with the shepherds who selfishly use
[4247.84 → 4248.88] their power for gain
[4248.88 → 4254.56] as God he is showing them what God
[4254.56 → 4258.10] really looks like God's power is one
[4258.10 → 4262.02] that has its power to serve one that
[4262.02 → 4267.38] gives his life for others now if you're
[4267.38 → 4268.96] wondering if that's how it was
[4268.96 → 4271.40] understood in that day you can just
[4271.40 → 4273.14] look at the response of the people that
[4273.14 → 4276.24] were listening to him, they respond like
[4276.24 → 4279.80] they understand these people are
[4279.80 → 4280.72] divided
[4280.72 → 4285.10] that you could picture them kind of
[4285.10 → 4288.78] picking up stones to kill him over this
[4288.78 → 4291.32] it's one thing to claim to be the
[4291.32 → 4293.48] messiah to but to claim to be God that's
[4293.48 → 4295.92] going too far they say you are a man
[4295.92 → 4301.28] you a mere man claim to be God and they
[4301.28 → 4303.44] see this claim this outward claim
[4303.44 → 4305.84] outright claim just to be God and they
[4305.84 → 4308.12] are surprised they're offended by it
[4308.12 → 4311.46] but if you read the Gospel of John if
[4311.46 → 4313.32] you've been following in the story you're
[4313.32 → 4316.06] probably not as surprised as these first
[4316.06 → 4317.60] hearers because John's been dropping
[4317.60 → 4320.08] hints or just saying outright throughout
[4320.08 → 4324.48] the Gospel of John that this Jesus is God he
[4324.48 → 4327.34] says it in the first chapter in verse 14 he
[4327.34 → 4330.12] has this famous declaration the word or
[4330.12 → 4334.40] God became flesh and dwelt among us
[4334.40 → 4338.60] so as once by the time we get to
[4338.60 → 4340.58] chapter 10 we might not be as surprised
[4340.58 → 4345.08] with Jesus claiming to be God but what
[4345.08 → 4349.98] might be a little bit surprising is what God
[4349.98 → 4355.28] taking on flesh looks like that God taking
[4355.28 → 4357.44] on flesh was only the beginning of the
[4357.44 → 4359.44] depths that God was willing to do to
[4359.44 → 4363.20] rescue his people the shepherd is one who
[4363.20 → 4367.66] also lays down his life for the sheep like
[4367.66 → 4374.92] that's the type of God that this is now what
[4374.92 → 4378.88] gives this final security for us, we who are
[4378.88 → 4383.68] sheep I think it's its helpful for us to
[4383.68 → 4389.04] finish with this image again remembering that the
[4389.04 → 4393.50] security doesn't come from being transformed into
[4393.50 → 4396.22] anything more powerful it's not about the
[4396.22 → 4399.06] sheep becoming something different the
[4399.06 → 4400.86] sheep remain sheep
[4400.86 → 4405.20] it's not even about gathering ourselves
[4405.20 → 4407.30] together, so there's just more of us and
[4407.30 → 4409.08] then maybe we'll be protected maybe we'll be
[4409.08 → 4409.92] safe that way
[4409.92 → 4413.88] the security has nothing to do with the
[4413.88 → 4417.44] ability or the number of the sheep it is in
[4417.44 → 4421.76] their belonging to the shepherd those who have
[4421.76 → 4424.04] heard his voice those who believed him those
[4424.04 → 4425.12] who followed him
[4425.12 → 4429.62] we only need to listen to what the shepherd
[4429.62 → 4433.88] says follow his voice and go where he
[4433.88 → 4438.00] leads remember the one who calls us
[4438.00 → 4441.70] invites us forward doesn't do so as one
[4441.70 → 4444.40] kind of pushing us from behind telling us to
[4444.40 → 4448.12] go somewhere unfamiliar Jesus calls us to
[4448.12 → 4449.58] come to him
[4449.58 → 4455.40] and my encouragement my hope the prayer for
[4455.40 → 4457.88] you are that you may know this security
[4457.88 → 4461.70] may you know that no matter what our
[4461.70 → 4464.24] vulnerability is whatever that draws that
[4464.24 → 4469.74] out that nobody can snatch you from him
[4469.74 → 4474.20] we may have our hardships and that
[4474.20 → 4478.62] chaos still stays there we may know our set of
[4478.62 → 4481.56] challenges, but we trust that the good shepherd is
[4481.56 → 4484.44] present in it and through it
[4484.44 → 4488.58] that the good shepherd ultimately has all in
[4488.58 → 4492.10] control after all we do belong to him
[4492.10 → 4496.94] and with that knowledge of belonging in him
[4496.94 → 4500.82] that's nothing new especially for those in the
[4500.82 → 4503.12] Christian reform church who are forced to
[4503.12 → 4505.74] memorize the Heidelberg catechism question and
[4505.74 → 4509.04] answer number one it's its something that we're
[4509.04 → 4513.76] going to read together to finish the service here and
[4513.76 → 4520.58] it's its a fascinating kind of catechism note for catechism is
[4520.58 → 4525.22] something for teaching and for those if you don't know kind of what the Heidelberg
[4525.22 → 4531.60] catechism is it was written 450 plus years ago for children to educate
[4531.60 → 4535.78] children on who god is so they don't
[4535.78 → 4539.42] approach it in the way that a lot of the textbooks of the day did if it was in the
[4539.42 → 4542.72] textbooks they would say this is who god is, and they would start with all
[4542.72 → 4546.68] these definitions about god but instead the Heidelberg catechism was
[4546.68 → 4553.00] kind of unique in its approach saying well where is our comfort it points back to the
[4553.00 → 4558.18] person it's something that's very personal in its nature and its first
[4558.18 → 4561.88] question and answer ends up being something quite popular something that
[4561.88 → 4565.40] points back to a great summary of where our comfort
[4565.40 → 4567.08] truly is
[4567.08 → 4572.32] it's a statement of belonging pointing towards
[4572.32 → 4575.56] this ultimate belonging to our good shepherd
[4575.56 → 4580.98] so I invite you to say these words with me hopefully you can see it from where

[4586.30 → 4593.58] comfort in life and in death that I am not my own but belong
[4593.58 → 4602.08] body and soul in life and in death to my faithful saviour Jesus Christ he has fully
[4602.08 → 4608.06] paid for all my sins with his precious blood and has set me free from the
[4608.06 → 4615.62] tyranny of the devil he also watches over me in such a way that not a hair can fall
[4615.62 → 4623.06] from my head without the will of my father in heaven in fact all things must work together
[4623.06 → 4633.06] for my salvation because I belong to him Christ by his Holy Spirit assures me of eternal life and
[4633.06 → 4638.74] makes me wholeheartedly willing and ready from now on to live for him
