[0.00 → 12.58] I keep minding, you keep giving, keep providing, I have all that I need, you are all that I need.
[13.90 → 24.86] I keep praying, you keep moving, I keep praying, you keep proving, I have all that I need,
[24.86 → 35.98] you are all that I need, I have all that I need, you are all that I need.
[38.56 → 46.52] There's honey in the rock, water in the stone, man on the ground, no matter where I go,
[46.52 → 54.24] I don't need to worry now that I know, I know everything I need, you got.
[54.62 → 62.16] There's honey in the rock, purpose in your plan, power in the world, healing in your hands,
[62.42 → 69.66] it started flowing when you said it is done, Jesus, Jesus, who you are is enough.
[69.66 → 76.08] There's honey in the rock, there's honey in the rock.
[76.52 → 84.34] There's honey in the rock, there's honey in the rock.
[86.62 → 94.06] Oh, how sweet, how sweet it is to trust in you, Jesus.
[94.06 → 101.86] Oh, how sweet, how sweet it is to trust in you, Jesus.
[101.86 → 109.72] Oh, how sweet, how sweet it is to trust in you, Jesus.

[345.98 → 347.98] Thank you.
[347.98 → 349.98] Thank you.
[349.98 → 351.98] Thank you.
[351.98 → 369.72] my eyes in wonder and show me who you are and fill me with your heart and lead me in your love to those around me.
[370.72 → 374.14] I will build my life upon you.
[376.54 → 378.20] Good morning.
[378.20 → 378.46] Good morning.
[380.36 → 382.12] Like three of you answered me there.
[382.20 → 382.74] Let's try that again.
[382.78 → 383.16] Good morning.
[384.14 → 385.10] Thank you.
[385.64 → 387.58] I appreciate the same three being just louder.
[387.94 → 388.36] That's great.
[389.08 → 390.92] Welcome to worship.
[391.14 → 391.78] My name is Chris.
[391.96 → 402.76] I'm one of the pastors here at Emanuel Church, and it's my pleasure, along with these others and a few more yet, to lead in our shared worship this morning.
[402.76 → 409.84] Before we are greeted by God and called into his presence, we have a couple housekeeping announcements to make.
[410.10 → 419.46] And so, first, if you are part of the youth program, there is youth coffee after worship this morning.
[420.22 → 423.66] And that's going to take place at Richard and Anna Maria's house.
[424.18 → 425.42] They are here this morning.
[425.54 → 427.38] Can you guys just wave if people need an address?
[427.48 → 427.96] They can go.
[428.14 → 430.76] And then Mike and Kim Print are also in charge.
[430.76 → 432.18] Are they here somewhere this morning?
[432.94 → 433.72] Not currently.
[434.02 → 437.40] Anyway, if you know who they are, they can also help you figure out where to go.
[437.46 → 439.08] That's after service today.
[439.88 → 446.34] As well, on Tuesday, there is an abuse prevention training workshop that will take place.
[446.44 → 448.56] This is the third time we've offered this training.
[448.66 → 457.08] This is really for all of our volunteers and especially people who work with vulnerable either youth or adults here at Emanuel.
[457.08 → 459.30] We need you to participate in this.
[459.42 → 466.34] And so, please make a plan of coming to that on Tuesday if you haven't yet been to one of those.
[467.16 → 469.50] It begins at 7 o'clock.
[470.28 → 471.70] He says hesitantly.
[471.84 → 473.26] Someone confirm if I'm wrong.
[474.42 → 476.80] No one is confirming, so I must be right.
[477.90 → 480.38] Double-check the calendar because all of a sudden I'm doubting myself.
[480.80 → 481.60] Online calendar.
[481.90 → 482.80] But that's Tuesday.
[482.80 → 486.70] Also, Tuesday morning, coffee break is starting back up.
[486.78 → 489.86] That's a woman's ministry that we run here.
[490.04 → 498.26] And so, if that's something you are participating in or interested in connecting about, that's starting on Tuesday morning.
[498.52 → 504.38] And then this week, as we're jumping back into the regularly scheduled programming here on Thursday,
[505.04 → 506.92] GEMS will happen as well.
[506.92 → 514.84] And so, that's a girls' ministry for young elementary and middle school-aged girls.
[514.98 → 519.34] And so, if you're interested in that, that's on Thursday evening.
[520.42 → 530.78] Also, this morning and this week, we're celebrating with Daniel and Dismay Howling as they have welcomed another baby, Gus, into their family.
[531.40 → 532.50] That's when you applaud.
[532.60 → 532.80] Yay.
[532.92 → 533.98] Congratulations to them.
[533.98 → 534.98] Thank you.
[536.48 → 542.78] One of the ways that we serve new and growing families is by providing meals for them.
[542.88 → 544.76] And so, we've set up a meal train.
[545.28 → 551.96] If you're interested or able to help with that, please just talk to Wendy Culverts or Karen Astra,
[552.24 → 556.04] and they will help you get that coordinated for them.
[557.12 → 559.08] I think that's all for this morning.
[559.08 → 565.56] I'm going to invite you, as you're able, to stand, and we can be ushered into God's presence together.
[565.56 → 576.86] When we gather as a community of believers, we gather in the presence of our God.
[577.22 → 582.34] He is here among us in a special and unique way in worship.
[582.54 → 590.02] And we mark that, and we acknowledge that, as he greets us and welcomes us into this place for worship.
[590.02 → 592.44] We receive the greeting of God.
[594.02 → 597.52] Grace, mercy, and peace to you.
[597.82 → 604.96] From God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son, through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[605.58 → 607.48] All God's people said, Amen.
[607.48 → 607.66] Amen.
[607.66 → 615.66] 55.
[615.66 → 619.78] Come to the water, all who are thirsty.
[620.52 → 622.44] All you who thirst.
[622.92 → 625.12] Come drink deeply from the river of life.
[625.84 → 627.86] Come to the water, all who are weary.
[628.52 → 631.04] Come rest in the quiet pools of God's love.
[631.84 → 635.60] Come to the water, all you who long for justice.
[635.60 → 638.78] Come be renewed in God's overflowing stream.
[639.56 → 643.60] For God is here among us, washing away the dust and grime of our lives,
[644.16 → 648.24] and pouring out his Spirit on all of us who thirst.
[648.24 → 653.98] I know.
[654.20 → 656.94] And that's our gospel.
[656.94 → 686.92] I love you.

[1018.70 → 1022.02] Please join me this morning in our prayer of confession.
[1025.26 → 1028.78] Lord, we come to you this morning with grateful hearts,
[1029.74 → 1033.62] grateful because you are forever compassionate and gracious,
[1034.50 → 1036.98] slow to anger and abounding in love.
[1038.42 → 1042.34] Lord, although we confess that our sins are many and frequent,
[1043.04 → 1049.04] and often we admit repetitive, we ask again and again for your forgiveness.
[1049.04 → 1054.44] We thank you that you have not dealt with us according to our sins,
[1054.66 → 1057.64] nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
[1058.14 → 1060.52] What grace you have shown us.
[1062.04 → 1066.28] Lord, you have also assured us that as high as the heavens are above the earth,
[1066.74 → 1070.68] so great is your loving kindness toward us who fear you.
[1070.68 → 1071.68] what kindness you have shown us.
[1071.68 → 1073.90] What kindness you have shown us.
[1075.30 → 1080.02] We thank you, gracious and kind Lord, that as we celebrate Lord's Supper this morning,
[1080.02 → 1083.90] we are reminded that through your sacrifice on the cross,
[1083.90 → 1089.28] we can have assurance that as far as the east is from the west,
[1089.74 → 1093.52] so far have you removed our transgressions from us.
[1093.52 → 1101.34] may we be and remain forever grateful for your sacrifice on the cross.
[1101.34 → 1104.68] in your precious name we pray, Jesus.
[1105.78 → 1106.12] Amen.
[1106.12 → 1106.28] Amen.

[1820.52 → 1823.48] And on that day, we'll see that it was worth it
[1823.48 → 1837.44] There will be a day when all will bow for Him. There will be a day when death will be no more.
[1837.44 → 1845.32] Standing face to face with He who adored and rose above.
[1845.32 → 1860.20] Holy, holy is the Lord, so let it be today. We shall be together with angels and the saints.
[1860.20 → 1872.08] We raise mighty You, glory to our God, You gave us life beyond the grave.
[1872.08 → 1893.08] Holy, holy is the Lord.
[1893.08 → 1913.20] Good morning. My name is Mr. Mike, and I'm going to invite all the kindergartens to, well, no, grade, sorry, three-year-olds, all the way up to grade four.
[1913.30 → 1915.28] I get all mixed up. Come on up, guys.
[1915.80 → 1917.90] And we're going to head off to children's worship time pretty quick.
[1917.90 → 1924.90] But I have a few questions for you first.
[1924.90 → 1928.90] It's good to see you guys. It's been a while, hey?
[1928.90 → 1932.90] Yeah, I haven't seen you since last year, some of you.
[1932.90 → 1935.90] Been waiting all week for that joke. Nothing.
[1935.90 → 1940.90] Anyway, did you guys have a good holiday? I haven't seen you since before the holidays.
[1940.90 → 1945.46] Yeah? Did you guys, like, were you, like, so excited for Christmas?
[1946.24 → 1949.34] Yeah? Did you think about it for months and months and months?
[1949.90 → 1950.86] Yeah, yeah, I know.
[1951.14 → 1955.34] And sometimes, do you sometimes think about children's worship time that way?
[1955.80 → 1957.60] Okay, good answer.
[1958.90 → 1961.60] I know. Hey, what's the big thing with Christmas?
[1961.90 → 1964.92] What are we celebrating that we're so anxious for?
[1965.14 → 1966.90] Jesus' birthday, right? Jesus' birthday.
[1966.90 → 1974.40] Well, sometimes we have these big things, like holidays or Christmas or going on a big trip
[1974.40 → 1978.22] that we, like, look forward to forever, and we just think about it so much
[1978.22 → 1980.74] and it just can't come any faster, right?
[1980.82 → 1986.20] Just like Jesus' birthday or, like, your own birthday, maybe.
[1986.82 → 1988.06] Yeah? I know, right?
[1988.88 → 1989.78] Is your birthday soon?
[1989.86 → 1991.56] I know. I bet you some of you guys just had one.
[1991.94 → 1992.66] Some of you are coming up.
[1992.66 → 1993.88] What is one of the big things?
[1993.98 → 1999.96] If I put this big cake in front of you, would that be, like, oh, my goodness.
[2000.04 → 2002.48] Like, if your mom showed you this birthday cake, and she's, like,
[2002.48 → 2007.40] I'm going to make you this birthday cake for your birthday, would you be, like, so excited?
[2007.98 → 2009.60] But would you want it, like, right away?
[2010.64 → 2011.00] No.
[2011.14 → 2014.08] Some of you could probably wait, but I would want to eat it right away.
[2014.14 → 2015.28] I wouldn't know what to do with myself.
[2016.18 → 2017.10] It's just a muffin.
[2018.00 → 2020.74] Maybe some people love a good muffin, I'll tell you.
[2020.74 → 2022.58] You know what, though?
[2022.62 → 2025.92] I had a big birthday recently, and I thought about it for months and months
[2025.92 → 2028.66] and I looked forward to all these things,
[2028.76 → 2031.18] but I didn't know what was going to all happen at my big birthday.
[2031.80 → 2034.42] And then it came and guess what?
[2035.40 → 2037.82] It was even better than I thought it was going to be.
[2038.50 → 2041.92] There was, like, there was, like, a party and I had a big cake
[2041.92 → 2045.96] and there was a special visitor that flew in to visit that I didn't know was coming.
[2046.44 → 2049.78] And then we went, like, laser tagging and we played my favourite game.
[2049.78 → 2054.84] All of these things, it promised to be even better than I thought.
[2054.96 → 2056.34] Does that sometimes happen for you guys?
[2056.86 → 2057.54] I hope so.
[2057.62 → 2060.82] Sometimes we look forward to things, and then it's even better than we thought.
[2061.24 → 2061.54] Right?
[2062.16 → 2065.60] We're going to talk about that today in Children's Worship Time
[2065.60 → 2068.32] because we just talked about Jesus coming, right?
[2069.00 → 2074.54] We just talked about him coming and maybe, maybe for the Israelites and even for us,
[2074.54 → 2080.12] maybe there's an even bigger promise yet to come that we are,
[2080.20 → 2082.18] it's going to be even better than we think it can be.
[2082.44 → 2082.60] Yeah?
[2082.72 → 2085.00] So we'll talk about that some more today in Children's Worship Time.
[2085.24 → 2088.80] We're starting a whole new sort of section about Jesus' life
[2088.80 → 2093.30] and all the big promises that he fulfilled that lots of people have looked forward to
[2093.30 → 2094.30] for a long, long time.
[2095.10 → 2096.84] Okay, let's stand and do the Children's Blessing
[2096.84 → 2098.60] and we'll talk some more in Children's Worship Time.
[2098.60 → 2102.02] All right.
[2102.96 → 2106.84] Put our arms up, and we're going to bless our moms and dads and brothers and sisters
[2106.84 → 2109.14] that are going to hang out here in the sanctuary.
[2109.98 → 2111.64] The Lord be with you.
[2112.46 → 2112.94] Amen.
[2128.60 → 2129.94] Good morning, everyone.
[2130.10 → 2130.98] My name's Eric.
[2131.12 → 2132.86] I'm a council member here at Emanuel.
[2134.64 → 2137.62] First Sunday kind of in the new year.
[2137.72 → 2138.66] Happy New Year, everyone.
[2138.90 → 2139.40] Happy New Year.
[2140.30 → 2140.84] Happy New Year.
[2140.96 → 2141.20] All right.
[2141.24 → 2141.64] That's good.
[2143.28 → 2147.04] Just a couple of council notes before we go into family prayer this morning.
[2149.20 → 2154.58] A few weeks ago, we said thanks to Sylvia, and she's moved on
[2154.58 → 2159.66] and Marilyn has taken her position in the office, so we're quite thankful for that.
[2161.08 → 2165.66] So that transition's happening here in the new year over the next couple of weeks.
[2166.04 → 2168.62] Sylvia's working on training Marilyn for that.
[2168.78 → 2173.34] So everything should still go into the same steps in terms of getting receipts
[2173.34 → 2176.18] and all that stuff for your givings for the year and all those kinds of things.
[2176.28 → 2177.84] So if you have a chance to come to the office
[2177.84 → 2180.76] and you want to introduce yourself to Marilyn, that would be fantastic.
[2182.00 → 2183.50] Another item of Thanksgiving,
[2183.50 → 2188.16] even though we were short about 8% from our budget for 2022,
[2188.60 → 2195.76] we are very thankful and gracious that we were able to cut down on the difference
[2195.76 → 2196.46] at the end of the year.
[2196.54 → 2199.78] So we thank you, everyone, for their financial contributions at the end of the year.
[2201.48 → 2202.72] And some news.
[2202.92 → 2205.44] So since we have an opening in the office right now,
[2205.50 → 2207.00] we're calling the new position.
[2207.12 → 2208.82] It's going to be called the Communications Assistant,
[2208.82 → 2211.52] and there is a link on the website.
[2211.66 → 2215.48] So if anyone is interested in that position here at Emmanuel,
[2215.48 → 2218.10] you may have a chance to look at it on the website.
[2218.36 → 2221.92] And if you have any questions, you can always talk to Pastor Chris or myself
[2221.92 → 2225.92] or Stacey Klosterhoff if you have any questions about that position.
[2225.92 → 2229.92] Transitioning now to family prayer,
[2229.98 → 2233.36] there are a couple of things that I wanted to pass your way.
[2234.16 → 2238.86] Benita Said, turns out she has a tumour on her bladder,
[2239.08 → 2242.20] and later on this week she's going to be getting a biopsy on it
[2242.20 → 2243.90] to find out what's going on there,
[2244.02 → 2246.14] whether it's something to be of concern.
[2246.24 → 2249.20] Obviously it's of concern, but what the next steps will be.
[2249.20 → 2256.68] Dave Harris a few weeks ago was reporting on his wife Leanne's dad
[2256.68 → 2259.14] who has advanced stage cancer in his lungs.
[2260.14 → 2261.28] Not much has changed there.
[2261.38 → 2263.26] He has maybe days, weeks to live,
[2263.44 → 2266.04] because the cancer has advanced quite a bit.
[2267.30 → 2268.76] If you had a chance to look at the bulletin,
[2268.90 → 2272.16] we want the Heine family lost someone special to you.
[2272.44 → 2275.22] Henry, Marie's dad's wife,
[2275.32 → 2278.40] passed away recently in the last couple of weeks,
[2278.40 → 2280.96] so that's an item of prayer for their family.
[2283.32 → 2285.16] Item of thanks, Chris already mentioned it,
[2285.18 → 2287.08] to the Howling family for a new little baby there.
[2287.22 → 2288.76] Gus, we're thankful for that.
[2288.82 → 2291.20] Another addition to the family, Emmanuel family.
[2293.42 → 2295.56] And I just want to, part of my prayer this morning
[2295.56 → 2300.64] is going to be about for parents over the last couple of months.
[2300.64 → 2304.00] I've been hearing some things from parents about little kids,
[2304.18 → 2307.76] teenagers, adult kids, the challenges that are with that.
[2307.76 → 2313.04] So I just want to let you know that you're in my prayers and thoughts as well.
[2313.24 → 2316.88] So I'm going to have that as part of my prayer this morning.
[2317.14 → 2318.68] So please join me in prayer.
[2320.64 → 2322.90] Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be your name.
[2323.88 → 2325.56] Thank you, God, for this day.
[2326.20 → 2328.84] A nice Sunday morning where we can come here to work church,
[2328.92 → 2331.52] to worship you and enjoy fellowship with our church family.
[2331.52 → 2336.06] We give thanks for this country, city we live in,
[2336.12 → 2339.02] with all its beauty, potential, and social stability.
[2340.06 → 2343.88] We sometimes, Lord, forget how blessed we are to live in this country of Canada
[2343.88 → 2346.46] and often speak of the issues and problems we have.
[2347.42 → 2351.66] But really, when we take a moment to listen and read about the amount of strife
[2351.66 → 2355.74] in other parts of the world, like Ukraine, China, and now Mexico,
[2355.74 → 2357.44] we are thankful for our country.
[2359.30 → 2361.60] Lord, in our own church, we have much to be thankful for.
[2361.68 → 2365.80] We have a great staff leading us, our youth, our children, and our young adults.
[2366.74 → 2370.90] Our ministry programs are doing well, from cadets to gems to children's worship time
[2370.90 → 2375.42] to youth and coffee break and all the others that happen regularly here at Emmanuel.
[2375.42 → 2379.78] We are thankful for the leadership team of elders and deacons
[2379.78 → 2383.02] who have taken on the responsibilities that come with those roles.
[2384.66 → 2387.90] And, Lord, we cannot forget the many volunteers here at Emmanuel
[2387.90 → 2391.14] that put in a ton of effort to make this church function as it does.
[2392.54 → 2395.80] We give thanks, Lord, for the financial commitment of our members here
[2395.80 → 2397.08] to the operation of Emmanuel.
[2398.14 → 2401.46] Through the adversity of the world and locally over the past two years,
[2401.52 → 2404.18] we are blessed with the financial stability we have here.
[2405.42 → 2409.30] With all the blessings, Lord, we have to experience,
[2409.42 → 2412.20] we do have prayer requests to present to you at this time.
[2413.06 → 2417.58] We pray for the Heine family with the sudden loss of Henry's wife, Helen, recently.
[2418.48 → 2421.56] Helen was loved by many, and her free spirit will be missed.
[2422.54 → 2424.70] We pray for those in our family here at Emmanuel
[2424.70 → 2428.72] who are suffering physically from ailments that are affecting quality of life.
[2429.84 → 2431.84] This can be very difficult to manage
[2431.84 → 2435.74] and can be difficult psychologically to deal with on a day-to-day basis.
[2436.18 → 2438.18] We ask for healing for all of those people.
[2439.78 → 2441.36] We pray for those who are lonely,
[2441.90 → 2444.16] those who have mental health challenges, depression,
[2444.38 → 2446.04] and any of those unseen challenges.
[2446.04 → 2449.76] We ask you, Lord, to give these people peace and comfort,
[2449.92 → 2452.16] and may they feel your presence as they walk this journey.
[2453.54 → 2457.84] We pray, Lord, for parents and any of those who have the responsibility of mentoring
[2457.84 → 2463.44] or raising children today to be a parent, grandparent, or close family friend.
[2463.44 → 2467.70] From the age of little Gus Howling all the way to adult children,
[2467.82 → 2470.90] the handbook on navigating life is not an exact science.
[2472.20 → 2475.26] We pray, Lord, that you give parents of young children
[2475.26 → 2478.54] the energy and wisdom to do a great job raising their children.
[2479.66 → 2481.28] As children get older, Lord,
[2481.28 → 2483.36] we ask that you give parents even more wisdom
[2483.36 → 2487.10] to navigate the challenges of school and social life and home dynamics.
[2488.64 → 2491.00] And, Lord, as our children become teenagers and young adults,
[2491.12 → 2493.56] give us parents even more wisdom and patience
[2493.56 → 2496.44] as we assist our children into the transition to adulthood.
[2498.22 → 2501.12] For parents, as children become adults,
[2501.26 → 2503.36] many of the worries and challenges don't end,
[2503.70 → 2506.12] and sleepless nights and anxieties persist.
[2506.12 → 2511.78] Our world today seems to be more complex and complicated every year
[2511.78 → 2514.50] with numerous distractions from you, Lord.
[2515.42 → 2518.36] Our prayer, Lord, is that we can feel your presence and guidance
[2518.36 → 2521.54] in our parenting and raising of children in this world of ours.
[2522.34 → 2523.58] Give us wisdom and help,
[2524.20 → 2527.30] and help us find support in friends and resources
[2527.30 → 2529.32] and our church family and in you.
[2531.08 → 2532.32] It's a new year, Lord.
[2532.38 → 2534.16] We can see it as a fresh start.
[2534.16 → 2537.28] Lord, most of us set new goals and plans at this time.
[2538.18 → 2540.96] Our goal, Lord, will be to include you in those goals and plans.
[2541.88 → 2546.82] Give us wisdom, and may we feel you near in the year to come.
[2548.06 → 2550.94] We know, Lord, that not a hair does not fall from our head
[2550.94 → 2552.08] without you knowing of it.
[2552.78 → 2554.44] With that in mind, may we have confidence
[2554.44 → 2555.94] that you are in control of this world
[2555.94 → 2558.36] and that we can trust that your will be done
[2558.36 → 2559.54] and that you love us
[2559.54 → 2562.38] and want nothing less than the best for us.
[2564.16 → 2565.90] May we be a light for you, Lord,
[2566.28 → 2568.34] and to those around us in the week to come.
[2568.70 → 2570.34] And we ask all this in your name.
[2570.72 → 2570.96] Amen.
[2570.96 → 2571.06] Amen.
[2571.06 → 2571.08] Amen.

[2623.54 → 2624.12] Amen.
[2624.12 → 2630.62] Bible. I'm going to invite you to turn to that, open it up to Romans 1. We're going to read the
[2630.62 → 2644.28] first 15 verses together. From Romans 1.
[2644.28 → 2654.66] Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God.
[2655.34 → 2661.08] The gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy scriptures regarding his son,
[2661.88 → 2668.20] who as to his earthly life was a descendant of David, and who through the spirit of holiness
[2668.20 → 2676.50] was appointed the son of God in power by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord.
[2677.54 → 2684.08] Through him, we received grace and apostleship to call all the Gentiles to the obedience that comes
[2684.08 → 2691.86] from faith for his name's sake. And you also are among those Gentiles who are called to belong to
[2691.86 → 2702.16] Jesus Christ. To all in Rome who are loved by God and called to be his holy people, grace and peace to
[2702.16 → 2710.44] you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ. First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ
[2710.44 → 2717.98] for all of you because your faith is being reported all over the world. God, whom I serve in my spirit
[2717.98 → 2725.68] in preaching the gospel of his son is my witness how I constantly remember you in my prayers at all
[2725.68 → 2732.12] times. And I pray that now at last by God's will the way may be opened for me to come to you.
[2733.46 → 2741.74] I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong. That is,
[2741.82 → 2747.96] that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith. I do not want you to be
[2747.96 → 2753.10] unaware, brothers and sisters, that I planned many times to come to you, but have been prevented
[2753.10 → 2760.12] from doing so until now in order that I might have a harvest among you just as I have had among
[2760.12 → 2767.36] the other Gentiles. I am obligated both to Greeks and non-Greeks, both to the wise and the foolish.
[2768.16 → 2775.94] That is why I am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are in Rome.
[2775.94 → 2778.24] This is the word of the Lord.
[2783.58 → 2794.16] Have I asked you what your favourite book is? How might you respond? What's your favourite book?
[2794.16 → 2803.62] Ecclesiastes. Oh, there's a stranger in the house, or a strange one in the house, we'll say.
[2804.30 → 2806.10] Ecclesiastes is meaningless. That doesn't count.
[2808.08 → 2809.34] Some of you got it. Great.
[2809.34 → 2816.84] Now, Ecclesiastes notwithstanding, I know that asking, what's your favourite book,
[2816.94 → 2824.52] presumes that you read. Now, I also know that many of you don't actually read, and so maybe we
[2824.52 → 2829.76] should ask, what's your favourite movie, or what's your favourite hobby? Right? I know
[2829.76 → 2836.24] for myself, I actually was thinking about this, but I really struggled to pick, and I couldn't choose
[2836.24 → 2843.14] between the Harry Potter Order of the Phoenix or the Christopher Pasolini Inheritance Cycle series,
[2843.26 → 2849.26] but that's four books, so then I thought that's cheating, so now I don't know. Maybe it's the
[2849.26 → 2855.72] Percy Jackson series. Maybe if it's the Tale of Magic. I'm looking at you, Dora. Yep.
[2855.72 → 2864.78] My son, who is seven, is really into Dogma and Captain Underpants. I don't know what that's all
[2864.78 → 2871.78] about. We're also reading a lot of those, like, who would win books in my house right now, right? So
[2871.78 → 2878.66] you've got, like, Lobster versus Crab, and then if they fight, who would win? Again, I don't, that seems
[2878.66 → 2892.36] to be a favourite. Travellers, there you go. What's your favourite? Grab the microphone.
[2892.36 → 2906.96] All right. We're going to live here again. What's your favourite book? Now, the reason I ask this
[2906.96 → 2914.06] question is because I'm about to say something that you might go, hmm, that seems strange, because one
[2914.06 → 2922.58] of my favourite books in the Bible is Romans, but you've probably also heard me say that one of my
[2922.58 → 2927.12] favourite books in the Bible is Philippians, and you might have also heard me say that one of my
[2927.12 → 2931.72] favourite books of the Bible is Galatians, and you might have heard me say that one of my favourite
[2931.72 → 2937.48] books of the Bible is Joshua. Now, if you have so many favourites, is there really a favourite? Maybe I
[2937.48 → 2945.96] should just say that my favourite book is the Bible. I bring this up because years ago, when I first
[2945.96 → 2951.68] met Rachel's parents, she's now my wife, my mother-in-law asked me this question,
[2952.30 → 2962.54] what's your favourite book? And I answered, Romans. Now, I love my mother-in-law very, very much,
[2962.54 → 2971.30] but she looked me square in the eyes, and she said, ah, Romans, huh? I'm more of a James kind
[2971.30 → 2980.82] of Christian. Give me something to do. Don't give me doctrine. And I thought, huh, this is how it's
[2980.82 → 2988.00] going to be for the rest of my life. Mom, if you're listening, because I know you might be, I love you.
[2988.00 → 2998.48] Point is, Romans can be a hard book because it is full of doctrine. It's one of the most,
[2998.78 → 3005.84] or the most expansive letters that Paul writes. It covers a huge swath of topics and goes deep into
[3005.84 → 3021.14] them. But that doesn't mean it's not practical, right? Good doctrine is always practical. And so even
[3021.14 → 3028.62] as we dig for the next while into the book of Romans, we will ground ourselves in the truth
[3028.62 → 3037.60] of what Paul writes, of what God says for our everyday practical lives together.
[3039.92 → 3043.50] I am going to ask something of you, though, throughout this, because
[3043.50 → 3052.44] if as we go through this series, you have questions or wondering, or you're taking notes
[3052.44 → 3058.82] and you're just not sure, reach out to me. Email me or call me, text me, whatever. Grab me after
[3058.82 → 3066.10] service. That's fine. Let's talk about it and let's wrestle together. As we begin, we start at the
[3066.10 → 3075.46] beginning. That makes sense. Romans 1. Now, Paul is writing this letter sometime around AD 57.
[3075.46 → 3083.36] It's during his third missionary journey, and he's probably in the Greek city of Corinth.
[3084.34 → 3090.24] And we know that from some of the overlap. We can talk about that in the people that he has met
[3090.24 → 3097.52] of Gaius and Erastus. Now, Paul, when he writes this letter, has not yet been to Rome. The church in
[3097.52 → 3104.66] Rome is not one that he founded, unlike many of the other churches of the day. He has not met the
[3104.66 → 3112.94] Christians in Rome, though it's clear he knows some of them or knows many of them even. What's more,
[3113.02 → 3118.80] it's also clear that he knows their struggles. He's heard of their challenges. He's heard of the
[3118.80 → 3124.40] divisions or the debates and the struggles that they are living in the midst of. And as he says in
[3124.40 → 3133.88] verse 11, he longs to see them so that he may impart to you or to them some spiritual gift to make you
[3133.88 → 3142.60] strong. And that verse, verse 11, is kind of the point of the whole letter, right? And it's the
[3142.60 → 3148.74] theme that we're going to focus on this morning, right? The spiritual gift that makes you strong.
[3150.18 → 3156.48] And so, of course, that begs the question, right? What is the gift? What will make this church strong?
[3156.48 → 3167.06] In a word, the answer to that question is pretty simple, and yet it is incredibly profound.
[3168.14 → 3175.32] The spiritual gift that Paul is talking about that will make the church in Rome strong is the gospel.
[3176.84 → 3179.84] Right off, right from the beginning, notice in verse 1,
[3179.84 → 3189.56] Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God.
[3190.84 → 3195.78] Now, if you are familiar with the New Testament writings or if you're familiar with the classics
[3195.78 → 3203.40] period, you know that this is a pretty standard letter opening format that Paul is using.
[3203.40 → 3210.54] Now, today, when we write letters or emails or even sometimes texts, right, we start with the other
[3210.54 → 3218.90] person's name, right? We say, dear Rachel, how I love you. Let me count the ways. Have I ever written
[3218.90 → 3227.46] you that letter? No. But I do, right? Or we might send a text. Hey, Kevin, it's Chris. It's good to see
[3227.46 → 3233.96] you at church on Sunday. Want to grab coffee this week? Not in Paul's day. In Paul's day, you started
[3233.96 → 3242.14] with your own name and then probably with a title or a position statement of authority as to why this
[3242.14 → 3252.94] person should listen to you. So, Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ. Now, that word servant in Greek
[3252.94 → 3262.60] is doulas. It's a slave. More specifically, it's someone who calls themselves, or who gives themselves
[3262.60 → 3269.98] rather, completely into the service of another. The old word that was used here in the Bible translation
[3269.98 → 3277.82] is bond servant. But that's not really a word we use anymore and even less so one that we know what
[3277.82 → 3285.34] it means. Point is, it's a particular type of slave, right? It's not a servant like a butler or a waiter,
[3285.34 → 3293.62] and it's also not a slave like in the chattel slave industry of stealing black or brown people from
[3293.62 → 3302.42] their homes and forcing them into some sort of labour, right? A bond servant is someone who serves
[3302.42 → 3312.10] and who gives themselves entirely into that service. In fact, throughout the Bible, and Paul,
[3312.10 → 3319.68] you may know, is a Pharisee. He's a trained Pharisee. So, he knows the Old Testament backwards and forwards,
[3319.82 → 3327.06] probably has much of it, if not all of it, memorized. He knows that Moses and David and Elijah
[3327.06 → 3335.82] are all called servants of the Lord. And so, not only is Paul picking up on that tradition and the
[3335.82 → 3340.18] authority that comes with it, because it's interesting, right? Moses, David, and Elijah,
[3340.40 → 3347.58] Moses who represents the Torah, David who represents the kingship, and Elijah who represents the prophets,
[3347.58 → 3352.60] not only is he picking up on the authority that comes with that tradition, but he's furthering it,
[3352.60 → 3360.40] right? In the Old Testament, in each case that that phrase is used, servant or slave of the Lord,
[3360.98 → 3367.06] it's used with the word LORD in all caps, if you're reading it in English, right? Which is the covenant
[3367.06 → 3375.38] name of God, right? In Hebrew, it's Yahweh. It's the name that God gives himself in Exodus 3, the story of
[3375.38 → 3384.78] the burning bush with Moses. Moses asks God's voice there and says, who shall I say is sending me? And God
[3384.78 → 3398.00] says, Yahweh, Asher Yahweh. I am who I am. The am is sending you. Now, Paul takes that bond servant of
[3398.00 → 3410.84] the Lord title, and he appends it to Jesus Christ, right? Paul, a bond servant of Jesus Christ. See, already
[3410.84 → 3423.42] he is making a not-so-subtle theological claim about who Jesus is, right? Jesus is the am taking on
[3423.42 → 3432.40] flesh. And so, take that idea and then circle back with me. Paul wants to give the Christians in Rome
[3432.40 → 3439.16] a gift that will make them strong, and that gift is the gospel of God. Remember, in verse 1, he says
[3439.16 → 3444.50] that he is set apart for the gospel of God, and then in verse 15, he says, that's why I'm so eager to
[3444.50 → 3449.50] preach the gospel. He says, that's why I'm so eager to preach the gospel. He says, that's why I'm so eager to
[3449.50 → 3449.54] preach the gospel. He says, that's why I'm so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are in Rome. And now,
[3449.54 → 3459.24] what we begin to see is the gospel is the truth of the person of Jesus Christ. And right there,
[3459.48 → 3467.86] at this point, I want you to see something. Paul wants them to have a gift that will make them strong.
[3467.86 → 3477.48] And he gives them the gospel. Now, that's really fascinating to me, because in my experience as
[3477.48 → 3481.10] pastor, and I am privileged to have these sorts of conversations with people all the time,
[3481.46 → 3488.42] all too often, as Christians, we think of the gospel and of believing the gospel as the thing,
[3488.56 → 3495.50] or the doctrine, or the gift that gets us into Christianity, right? That makes us Christian.
[3495.50 → 3502.14] But then, we have this internal shift that takes place, whereby to live as a Christian,
[3502.52 → 3508.00] we have to move on from the gospel. We have to have some other ideas, or we have to move to obedience,
[3508.26 → 3514.60] or to something more, right? We think that the gospel gets us in something else, and if I'm honest with
[3514.60 → 3519.40] you, that is usually ourselves, something about ourselves, something else makes you strong.
[3519.40 → 3527.36] But that's not Paul's point. Yes, the gospel gets you in. That is to say, believing the gospel is the
[3527.36 → 3533.12] first outward sign that you are, in fact, a Christian. But Paul's point over and over and over
[3533.12 → 3541.14] again throughout this entire letter is that the gospel makes you strong. That's Paul's aim in this
[3541.14 → 3547.62] letter, and that's what will be our aim in this entire series, to get you to understand the depths
[3547.62 → 3556.60] of the gospel, and then to experience the gospel in the everyday stuff of life, right? Paul teaches us
[3556.60 → 3565.52] deep doctrine precisely because it is wrong doctrine that keeps us slaves to fear. It is unbelief,
[3565.52 → 3571.72] or wrong faith that keeps us sinning, or in sin, is the language that Paul will use.
[3573.34 → 3580.08] Okay, let's look at it. In Romans 14, I think we have that one for the screen, we do. In Romans 14,
[3580.14 → 3593.84] verse 23, Paul says, everything that does not come from faith is sin. Now, part of what that means
[3593.84 → 3608.32] is that anything good that you do that isn't done from faith is actually not good. At least not good in
[3608.32 → 3616.68] the fullest sense of the word, right? Any good done apart from true faith isn't actually good. It's
[3616.68 → 3625.56] stained with sin. Now, some of you are going to hear me say that, and you don't like it, and you're going to want to
[3625.56 → 3636.46] disagree. And with all humility, your disagreement isn't with me, it's with the Bible. Now, you might want to say,
[3636.68 → 3643.78] surely my unbelieving friend does something good, right? Isn't it good when a non-Christian gives to the poor?
[3643.78 → 3652.08] Isn't it good when my atheist neighbour shovels my driveway after a snowstorm? And again, you don't have
[3652.08 → 3658.64] to reckon with me as much as you have to reckon with the Bible, right? If you want to call that good,
[3659.02 → 3664.24] how do you understand what Paul says when he writes, everything that does not come from faith
[3664.24 → 3670.90] is sin? Or in Romans 3, right, and we'll look at these in detail throughout. Romans 3, he says,
[3670.90 → 3675.40] there is no one righteous, not even one. And again, you might hear that and say, ah, but he says
[3675.40 → 3682.46] righteous there. Righteous is like perfect. And so maybe no one does perfect, but surely they do
[3682.46 → 3689.00] good. Well, okay, yes, he does say that, but righteous doesn't mean perfect, but we can get into that
[3689.00 → 3697.08] later. He does go on, though. He says that there is no one who does good, not even one.
[3697.08 → 3707.56] In chapter 7, right, Paul takes this reality, and he refers to it as a sinful nature, right? Where in
[3707.56 → 3713.34] people, as people, we are slaves. There's that word again, right? Remember, we said it was someone
[3713.34 → 3719.32] who gives themselves entirely, completely over to the object. He says that we are slaves to sin.
[3719.32 → 3727.28] You might remember the words of Jesus. In John 8, Jesus says, everyone who sins is a slave to sin.
[3728.70 → 3734.34] Now, what Paul is talking about in these verses, and the point that we're setting up here in contrast,
[3734.98 → 3741.36] is the doctrine of depravity. It's the part of the doctrine of sin. If you want the fancy word,
[3741.48 → 3747.86] it's hematology. It's the doctrine of sin, right? Paul looks into this in depth later, and so will we
[3747.86 → 3754.30] in the series, but the point in bringing it up now is because it relates to the idea that the gospel
[3754.30 → 3763.84] is not just the way into faith, but it is the fuel of faith, right? The gospel makes you strong in faith
[3763.84 → 3772.64] because apart from God, we can't do good, right? We need the gospel to do good. That's why this is so
[3772.64 → 3778.56] important, right? To believe the gospel, we need to know it, and to know it, we need to hear it, and then
[3778.56 → 3788.04] knowing and hearing it, we need to live it, but, and here's what I need you to hear, right? What then is
[3788.04 → 3798.32] the gospel, right? If the gospel is the way in and the way of faith, what is it?
[3798.32 → 3809.62] Because sometimes we make the gospel a sense or a feeling we have, right? Sometimes we think that
[3809.62 → 3820.12] faith is first a feeling, particularly a feeling of joy or of conviction, and then when that happens,
[3820.44 → 3827.08] right, when it happens that we don't feel joy, or we don't feel conviction, if instead we feel doubt
[3827.08 → 3834.80] in uncertainty, we think, oh, maybe I don't have faith, right? If I believed, I wouldn't feel this way,
[3835.06 → 3841.16] but I feel this way, so maybe I don't really believe, maybe I don't really know the gospel.
[3843.06 → 3850.68] Or to put it another way, what is the relationship between faith and the gospel? And then where does,
[3850.68 → 3859.36] or how does obedience come into play in all of this? And so like Paul is eager to preach to those
[3859.36 → 3868.04] in Rome, I am eager for us to see all of this, right? And so first, Paul says that the gospel is of
[3868.04 → 3874.64] God. And as I read that, it becomes a question of grammar, it's a question of genitive, right? What does
[3874.64 → 3880.54] that word of mean? Does it mean that it belongs to God, or it's about God, or it's from God?
[3882.52 → 3890.72] So let me, if the gospel is something that belongs to God, that means it's kind of a thing,
[3891.98 → 3898.70] right? But the gospel isn't a thing, and yet when we link it or equate the gospel with a feeling or a
[3898.70 → 3904.44] conviction, like we've just talked about, that we can lose, right? We are giving, or we are assuming a
[3904.44 → 3912.64] sort of, forgive the made-up word, a thingness to the gospel. But the gospel isn't something you hold.
[3914.50 → 3921.22] And so as we wrestle here, maybe it's helpful to talk about what the word gospel actually means.
[3921.96 → 3927.58] Gospel in Greek is Angelo, and it literally means good herald.
[3928.70 → 3936.62] Now in the time of Jesus and Paul, if on a faraway battlefield, the emperor won a great victory
[3936.62 → 3944.22] and brought peace and secured his authority to a new place, he would send out heralds,
[3944.62 → 3953.68] Angelo, to declare his victory and peace. So put simply, the gospel is a declaration
[3953.68 → 3962.42] and announcement. It is news of a victory declared. And that distinction matters because,
[3962.92 → 3973.66] hear this, the gospel is not advice. The gospel is not a list of rules. It is news. It is the good news
[3973.66 → 3983.64] of God declaring his victory. It is a declaration from God about his son, right? What does Paul say?
[3983.70 → 3990.96] The gospel of God, which he promised in the prophets and the holy scriptures regarding his son.
[3991.98 → 3998.64] The gospel is the good news from God about his son. And so a couple of things about this. One,
[3998.64 → 4010.48] the gospel is good news from God. It's of God. That means we don't get to make it up. We don't get
[4010.48 → 4018.84] to craft it. We don't get to change it. It's God's. He defines it. And yet, since the beginning of
[4018.84 → 4025.46] Christian history, people have been trying to redefine the gospel, trying to make it about health and
[4025.46 → 4032.82] prosperity in this life for right now, trying to make it about loving my neighbour and being generally
[4032.82 → 4038.86] ambiguously good, trying to make it about some secret escape plan or secret route to power.
[4039.36 → 4046.80] But the gospel is God's. We don't get to change it. All that's left to us is to accept it and accept
[4046.80 → 4054.28] the truths that are consequent with it, like the truth of depravity and being slaves to sin.
[4054.28 → 4059.92] But apart from the work of faith in the gospel and the regeneration that precedes it all,
[4065.92 → 4074.62] in 1 Corinthians 1.23, Paul says that the gospel is a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to
[4074.62 → 4081.26] the Greeks. In 1 Corinthians 1.18, he says, the message of the cross is foolishness to those
[4081.26 → 4090.68] who are perishing. And so, I think it's important for us to hear that it's okay if the gospel that we
[4090.68 → 4098.56] proclaim here on Sunday, day after day, week after week, sounds ludicrous and weird to those who don't
[4098.56 → 4109.14] yet believe. But if the gospel we proclaim is palatable, we've changed it. We've made it into something
[4109.14 → 4120.32] it's not. The gospel is the good news from God about his son. The gospel is about a person,
[4120.78 → 4130.80] not just an idea. It's about a person, not a concept or a doctrine. It's about him and not us. The gospel
[4130.80 → 4141.44] of Jesus is fundamentally a message about not about our lives, our dreams, or our hopes. It is a message
[4141.44 → 4148.48] that transforms our lives, our dreams, and our hopes, but only because it's actually not about us.
[4149.02 → 4153.48] It's a declaration of who God's son is. Look with me at verse 3.
[4153.48 → 4165.24] Paul says, regarding his son, who as to his earthly life was a descendant of David. Literally there it
[4165.24 → 4180.46] says, in his flesh. That is, he took on flesh as a descendant of David. He is fully human. And then,
[4180.46 → 4185.80] Paul continues, by the spirit of holiness, or another way to translate that is, by the Holy Spirit
[4185.80 → 4192.76] appointed the Son of God in power by the resurrection. Now, that doesn't mean that he
[4192.76 → 4199.74] became the Son of God because of the resurrection. It means because he is the Son of God, he was
[4199.74 → 4207.12] resurrected and exalted to a place of power. Remember two things about Jesus' story. At his baptism,
[4207.12 → 4213.60] when the heavens opened up and the Holy Spirit descended like a dove as John was baptizing him,
[4214.50 → 4222.56] anointing him with God's Spirit, God's voice said, this is my Son whom I love. And then likewise,
[4222.76 → 4230.26] after his resurrection, Jesus said, all authority, all power in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
[4230.26 → 4237.14] All right, in Philippians 2, this idea is carried forward in Jesus being exalted to the highest place.
[4238.26 → 4246.76] The point is, the gospel is about God's Son who took on flesh, the incarnation, and it's about his life
[4246.76 → 4252.94] as a descendant of David doing what David couldn't. It's about his death and his resurrection, and it's about
[4252.94 → 4259.22] his exaltation and his ascension. Every one of those aspects Paul will dig into in this letter.
[4259.22 → 4271.18] And so who is this Son of God? The name comes to us at the end of verse 4. Jesus Christ,
[4271.72 → 4284.98] our Lord. Jesus Christ is the gift. More specifically, the gospel about Jesus Christ is the spiritual gift
[4284.98 → 4293.54] that will make you strong. And so are you struggling with doubt? Remember the gospel, right? Where Jesus
[4293.54 → 4303.82] is God's Son taken on flesh. It happened in history. It is real. And here's the point, right? That your
[4303.82 → 4313.60] ability to reconcile that truth in your mind, your ability to accept it, doesn't change the fact that
[4313.60 → 4321.86] it's true. Even if you don't believe it, it still happened. It's still history. He is and he did.
[4323.28 → 4331.80] Are you struggling with obedience or disobedience, right? Remember the gospel where Jesus' obedience is
[4331.80 → 4340.44] the source of your righteousness, right? You don't earn God's grace. You don't keep God's favour by your
[4340.44 → 4347.06] obedience, right? If you did either of those things, neither would be grace. And if it's not grace,
[4347.50 → 4356.70] it's not the gospel. Maybe you're struggling with a lack of control in your life. Again, Paul says,
[4356.82 → 4364.54] remember the gospel, right? Even the chaos and the brokenness of sin in the world isn't enough to break
[4364.54 → 4372.58] God's grasp on history, right? God, what did we read? Promised beforehand through his prophets
[4372.58 → 4380.60] in the holy scriptures, right? That isn't just a good guess by some people, right? God's promise
[4380.60 → 4385.08] means it will come to pass. His sovereign will makes it happen.
[4385.08 → 4393.40] Almost every week in our worship together, you will hear me summarize and state the gospel
[4393.40 → 4399.76] in a very similar, if not exactly the same way. You will hear me say something along the lines of,
[4399.82 → 4405.52] the truth is, you are more sinful than you would ever dare admit, and yet you are more loved than you
[4405.52 → 4413.06] could ever imagine possible. And out of that love, God sent his son, Jesus Christ, into the world,
[4413.06 → 4419.10] taking on flesh to live the life I should have lived and to die the death that I deserve.
[4420.28 → 4429.22] And his righteous life and his sacrificial death is an atoning sacrifice for us. And three days later,
[4429.34 → 4434.90] he was raised victorious over sin and death, and he has ascended to the right hand of God,
[4434.98 → 4441.52] the Father Almighty. That's the gospel that we return to over and over and over again.
[4441.52 → 4452.10] And on and on we could go. And in this series, we will. It is about the gospel from first to last,
[4452.34 → 4461.02] all roads leading out of Romans, how the truth of the gospel applies to the everyday stuff of life.
[4461.02 → 4470.94] When we get the gospel right, that's when we start getting life as a Christian right.
[4470.94 → 4483.66] Now this is where I'll end for this morning. We've been looking at verse 11. Verse 11 feeds right into
[4483.66 → 4490.24] verse 12. I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gifts to make you strong.
[4490.58 → 4496.76] That is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith.
[4496.76 → 4505.36] Not only did Paul want to encourage the faith of the church in Rome, but he also needed his faith
[4505.36 → 4512.54] encouraged by them. And can I just say that if Paul needed his faith encouraged, right,
[4512.62 → 4520.60] Paul, who was used of God to grow the church in incredible ways throughout the then majority world,
[4520.60 → 4527.46] right, if Paul, who was used of God to form vast portions, almost the entirety of the New Testament
[4527.46 → 4535.40] canon, if Paul, who literally met the resurrected Jesus on the road to Damascus, if Paul needed his
[4535.40 → 4540.70] faith encouraged by a community of believers, how much more so do you and I?
[4540.70 → 4550.70] That's part of what happens each week when we gather together here, right? We gather together in
[4550.70 → 4557.22] worship, when we gather around the word, when we sing songs of praise, when we relive the experience of
[4557.22 → 4564.42] God coming to us and offering grace and forgiveness. And when we go from this place empowered by the Holy
[4564.42 → 4570.82] Spirit, right, we do not go alone. We go mutually encouraged. We go together.
[4572.90 → 4578.18] Do not scorn the gift of brothers and sisters in faith.
[4580.10 → 4582.10] You are my encouragement.
[4583.46 → 4585.06] I pray I can be yours.
[4585.86 → 4587.94] You are each other's encouragement.
[4587.94 → 4592.58] I pray you take advantage of God's gift to you.
[4594.10 → 4596.10] Because, may I just say,
[4596.90 → 4599.06] that if the current
[4599.06 → 4602.50] sort of cultural trajectory holds true,
[4602.94 → 4605.98] that is, if the trajectory that we seem to be on
[4605.98 → 4609.06] right now as a society here in the Western world,
[4609.50 → 4612.04] it is only going to get more difficult
[4612.04 → 4613.82] to be Christian.
[4613.82 → 4613.90] Christian.
[4615.42 → 4621.10] People are going to increasingly criticize us for being ludicrous and offensive,
[4621.98 → 4625.18] for being backwards or on the wrong side of history.
[4626.86 → 4629.66] I think we know that. Some of you have experienced that.
[4631.02 → 4639.26] What will matter is that we are part of a group of believers who are enduring the same thing together,
[4639.26 → 4645.90] so that we might persevere together in the midst of these kinds of trials that we all share.
[4646.46 → 4651.26] Because no matter what the world out there might say about us or about Christians or about Jesus,
[4651.26 → 4653.26] time and time and time again,
[4653.26 → 4656.46] we come back to the gospel of God,
[4656.46 → 4659.82] the good news about Jesus, his son.
[4659.82 → 4662.78] That is how we persevere.
[4663.90 → 4667.66] More than that, that is how we are preserved for him.
[4667.66 → 4671.42] Now in just a moment,
[4672.62 → 4675.58] that is what will happen for us at the table.
[4676.70 → 4686.86] We gather at this table so that the grace of God offered in the word might be confirmed for us in the supper.
[4686.86 → 4695.90] So that the good news of Jesus that's offered here in the word is offered here at the table.
[4696.94 → 4700.70] So that we might taste and see that the Lord is good.
[4701.90 → 4708.78] Jesus himself gave us this meal so that we might remember and believe.
[4708.78 → 4716.78] When we drink, we remember that his blood was poured out for many.
[4717.50 → 4721.82] His blood was poured out for the forgiveness of our sins.
[4722.30 → 4728.06] When we eat, we might believe that he was raised victorious over sin and death.
[4728.06 → 4729.02] And that's what we're going to do.
[4729.02 → 4739.82] Right here at this table, the good gift of God is offered in the real spiritual presence of Christ as we come.
[4741.18 → 4747.02] As we come to this table as a church family formed by God himself,
[4747.02 → 4755.34] we come to receive God himself in Jesus Christ.
[4756.94 → 4761.74] Now as we go through this table and come together to it, there will be a bit of a litany,
[4762.30 → 4764.86] a portion that I will speak and a portion that you will speak.
[4764.86 → 4766.54] I encourage you to speak those words.
[4766.54 → 4768.54] They'll be on the screen behind me in yellow.
[4768.54 → 4778.30] So, as you approach the table, come mindful of the fact that it is Jesus himself who you receive here.
[4779.50 → 4788.14] And it is Jesus' church, the bride of Christ with whom you receive him here.
[4788.94 → 4794.30] The grace of God made real, touchable, tangible, tasteable,
[4794.30 → 4800.14] so that you might see the goodness of the gospel.
[4803.74 → 4807.58] As we come to this table, I'm mindful that some of you might want prayer.
[4808.46 → 4814.14] There are going to be people at the back with tags on, yellow tags that are there to pray with you.
[4814.78 → 4817.90] Either before you come to the table or in place of coming to the table,
[4818.14 → 4821.98] they will be available at the back and I encourage you to go there.
[4821.98 → 4823.98] Let us pray.
[4823.98 → 4826.22] We come to the table of our Lord.
[4827.42 → 4829.80] Lift your hearts to the Lord.
[4833.82 → 4836.30] Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
[4840.86 → 4841.50] Let's pray.
[4843.98 → 4847.42] With joy, we praise you, gracious God.
[4847.42 → 4848.42] Amen.
[4848.42 → 4853.68] For you have created heaven and earth, made us in your image, and kept covenant with us,
[4853.80 → 4856.18] even when we fell into sin.
[4857.18 → 4862.28] We give you thanks for Jesus Christ, who by his life, death, and resurrection,
[4862.60 → 4866.46] opened to us the way of everlasting life.
[4867.58 → 4868.14] Amen.
[4868.14 → 4879.98] The Lord Jesus, before he suffered, gave us this memorial of his sacrifice until he comes again.
[4880.86 → 4885.02] The Lord Jesus, on the night when he was betrayed, he took bread,
[4885.34 → 4889.06] and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said,
[4889.20 → 4892.50] this is my body, which is for you.
[4893.14 → 4895.98] Do this in remembrance of me.
[4895.98 → 4907.10] In the same way, he took the cup after the supper and said,
[4907.64 → 4910.32] this cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[4910.76 → 4913.02] Do this in remembrance of me.
[4914.26 → 4918.12] For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup,
[4918.24 → 4921.38] you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.
[4921.38 → 4921.50] Amen.
[4925.98 → 4939.88] This is the mystery of our faith.
[4939.88 → 4963.98] Church family, the Lord has prepared his table for all who love him and trust in him alone for their salvation.
[4963.98 → 4968.14] And so, as we have said throughout this entire service,
[4968.30 → 4974.56] come to this table, you who have much faith and you who would like to have more.
[4975.32 → 4982.22] Come to this table, you who have been to this sacrament often and you who have not been in a long time.
[4982.76 → 4986.10] You who have tried to follow Jesus and you who have failed.
[4986.58 → 4991.62] Come to this table because Jesus Christ is raised.
[4991.62 → 5002.38] Come, if you are here or if you are at home and online, come because it is Christ who invites us to meet him here.
[5003.16 → 5006.88] The gifts of God for the people of God.
[5006.88 → 5018.14] As we come to this table, we are going to come in groups sent forward by ushers who will be in the aisles, and then we will serve one another.
[5018.14 → 5023.90] As you receive the tray of bread, and you pass it to the person beside you,
[5024.04 → 5025.34] we invite you to say,
[5025.34 → 5027.80] the body of Christ given for you.
[5028.46 → 5033.02] And then as you receive the tray of juice and pass it to the person beside you,
[5033.02 → 5036.78] we invite you to say, the blood of Christ shed for you.
[5037.36 → 5040.34] We will move through in groups in this way.
[5040.56 → 5048.06] First, I would like to invite the worship team and the people at the back of house who are helping us
[5048.06 → 5054.88] and the elders to come forward that we might serve them, and then they will lead us through this time with some music.
[5054.88 → 5055.12] Thank you.
[5055.12 → 5055.14] Thank you.
[5055.14 → 5055.16] Thank you.
[5055.16 → 5055.18] Thank you.
[5084.88 → 5114.86] Thank you.
[5114.88 → 5144.86] Thank you.
[5144.88 → 5174.86] Thank you.
[5174.88 → 5175.88] Thank you.
[5175.88 → 5181.88] Thank you.
[5181.88 → 5187.88] Thank you.
[5187.88 → 5217.86] Thank you.
[5217.88 → 5229.26] If you are unable to make your way to the front but would like to participate, please
[5229.26 → 5235.20] just indicate that to the elders who are ushering, and they will serve you in your seat.
[5247.88 → 5254.88] Thank you.
[5254.88 → 5261.88] Thank you.
[5261.88 → 5263.88] Thank you.
[5263.88 → 5264.88] Thank you.
[5264.88 → 5265.88] Thank you.
[5265.88 → 5266.88] Thank you.
[5266.88 → 5270.88] Thank you.
[5270.88 → 5271.88] Thank you.
[5271.88 → 5272.88] Thank you.
[5272.88 → 5273.88] Thank you.
[5273.88 → 5274.88] Thank you.
[5274.88 → 5275.88] Thank you.
[5275.88 → 5276.88] Thank you.
[5276.88 → 5277.88] Thank you.
[5277.88 → 5278.88] Thank you.
[5278.88 → 5279.88] Thank you.
[5279.88 → 5280.88] Thank you.
[5280.88 → 5285.34] from the Father's side,
[5286.04 → 5290.62] the Son of Godforsaken,
[5290.62 → 5296.74] the Holy Sacrifice.
[5297.32 → 5301.70] For me, he was forsaken,
[5302.92 → 5307.74] for me, he died alone.
[5307.74 → 5312.84] I sin forever taken,
[5312.84 → 5318.40] that I might be his own.
[5320.48 → 5326.40] The Holy Land was taken,
[5327.40 → 5332.00] abandoned at the Lord.
[5332.90 → 5337.34] He bore the world's affliction,
[5337.74 → 5342.74] he bore it as his own.
[5343.98 → 5348.34] For me, he was forsaken,
[5349.34 → 5353.74] for me, he died alone.
[5355.08 → 5359.48] My sin forever taken,
[5359.48 → 5364.48] glad I might be his own.
[5364.48 → 5372.48] And when my heart is broken,
[5372.48 → 5378.48] torn by my sin and pride,
[5378.48 → 5383.48] the Son of God now risen,
[5384.48 → 5388.08] will draw me to his side.
[5388.08 → 5394.08] For me, he was forsaken,
[5394.08 → 5399.08] for me, he died alone.
[5399.08 → 5405.08] My sin forever taken,
[5405.08 → 5406.08] my sin forever taken,
[5406.08 → 5410.08] that I might be his own.
[5410.08 → 5416.08] For me, he was forsaken,
[5416.08 → 5421.08] for me, he died alone.
[5421.08 → 5423.08] For me, he died alone.
[5423.08 → 5427.08] my sin forever taken,
[5427.08 → 5432.08] that I might be his own.
[5432.08 → 5433.08] and I must go away alone.
[5433.14 → 5435.14] For me, he died alone.
[5435.22 → 5437.08] For me, he died alone.
[5437.08 → 5437.44] My such as a good person,
[5437.48 → 5438.52] I my person forever made me alone.
[5438.68 → 5440.08] I must be alive alone there.
[5440.08 → 5441.08] He even though Stephen,
[5441.08 → 5441.78] I believe him втор别2,
[5441.78 → 5443.00] have destroyed his side.
[5443.08 → 5445.08] I was looking at your good life for me,
[5445.08 → 5445.68] that I was used to being Somerset MALE.
[5445.68 → 5475.66] How deep the Father's love for us
[5475.68 → 5481.68] How vast beyond all measure
[5481.68 → 5489.46] That he should give his only Son
[5489.46 → 5495.98] To make a wretch his treasure
[5495.98 → 5504.18] How great the pain of stealing loss
[5504.18 → 5510.88] The Father turns his face away
[5510.88 → 5517.94] As wounds which bore the Chosen One
[5517.94 → 5524.36] Bring many sons to glory
[5534.18 → 5543.72] Behold the man upon a cross
[5543.72 → 5549.88] My sin upon his shoulders
[5549.88 → 5557.78] Ashamed I hear my walking voice
[5557.78 → 5564.78] Call out among the scoffers
[5564.78 → 5571.48] It was my sin that held him bare
[5571.48 → 5577.48] Until it was accomplished
[5577.48 → 5585.32] His dying breath has brought me life
[5585.32 → 5591.22] I know that it is hidden
[5591.22 → 5609.66] I will not boast in anything
[5609.66 → 5616.48] No gifts, no power, no wisdom
[5616.48 → 5624.48] But I will boast in Jesus Christ
[5624.48 → 5630.04] His death and resurrection
[5630.04 → 5637.74] Why should I gain from his free home
[5637.74 → 5643.86] I cannot give an answer
[5643.86 → 5651.86] But this I know with all my heart
[5651.86 → 5657.68] His wounds have paid my ransom
[5657.68 → 5658.56] His wounds have paid my ransom
[5658.56 → 5665.56] Why should I gain from his reward
[5665.56 → 5672.56] I cannot give an answer
[5672.56 → 5681.26] But this I know with all my heart
[5681.26 → 5688.26] His wounds have paid my ransom
[5688.26 → 5690.16] For this I know with all my Pape
[5690.16 → 5691.00] O Lord
[5691.00 → 5697.08] His wounds have paid my
[5697.08 → 5699.96] Elongated
[5699.96 → 5701.16] I not чист his wounds
[5701.16 → 5703.96] My was is hidden
[5703.96 → 5705.96] Sometimes I know that it is evil
[5705.96 → 5707.76] But this I know with all my heart
[5707.76 → 5708.54] I know with you
[5708.54 → 5708.96] Why should I gain from his sole
[5708.96 → 5709.46] About an LA
[5709.46 → 5710.82] For
[5710.82 → 5711.10] op
[5711.10 → 5711.46] I love you
[5711.46 → 5712.06] I want you
[5712.06 → 5713.06] But this I know with you
[5713.06 → 5713.82] I know with you
[5713.82 → 5714.96] Everything came from it
