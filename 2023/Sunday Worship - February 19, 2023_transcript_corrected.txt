[0.00 → 3.46] When temptation comes my way
[3.46 → 9.10] And when I cannot stand, I'll fall on You
[9.10 → 15.10] Jesus, You're my hope and stay
[15.10 → 20.86] And when I cannot stand, I'll fall on You
[20.86 → 26.56] Jesus, You're my hope and stay
[30.00 → 37.60] Lord, I need You, oh, I need You
[37.60 → 43.98] Every hour I need You
[43.98 → 50.08] My one defence, my righteousness
[50.08 → 55.80] Oh God, how I need You
[60.00 → 66.88] Lord, I need You, oh, I need You
[66.88 → 73.82] Every hour I need You
[73.82 → 80.82] My one defence, my righteousness
[80.82 → 86.82] Oh God, how I need You
[86.82 → 95.20] My one defence, my righteousness
[95.20 → 101.48] Oh God, how I need You
[101.48 → 109.32] I need You
[109.32 → 139.30] Thank you.
[139.32 → 146.62] I was lost, but He brought me all His love for me.
[147.22 → 150.78] All His love for me.
[151.58 → 158.98] Who the sun sets free, who is free indeed.
[159.98 → 166.28] I'm a child of God, yes I am.
[169.32 → 175.96] Free dust He has ransomed me, His grace runs deep.
[177.72 → 184.12] While I was a slave to sin, Jesus died for me.
[184.12 → 188.12] Yes, He died for me.
[189.08 → 196.68] When the sun sets free, who is free indeed.
[196.68 → 204.10] I'm a child of God, yes I am.
[204.10 → 213.54] In my Father's house, there's a place for me.
[214.18 → 220.78] I'm a child of God, yes I am.
[220.78 → 226.46] I am chosen, not forsaken.
[227.18 → 230.14] I am who You say I am.
[230.86 → 235.10] You are for me, not against me.
[235.50 → 238.50] I am who You say I am.
[238.50 → 246.90] I am who You say I am.
[246.90 → 251.90] You are for me, not against me.
[251.90 → 255.30] I am who You say I am.
[255.30 → 260.06] I am who You say I am.
[260.06 → 263.90] Who the sun sets free.
[263.90 → 267.82] Always free indeed.
[267.82 → 275.22] I'm a child of God, yes I am.
[275.22 → 284.70] In my Father's house, there's a place for me.
[284.70 → 291.86] I'm a child of God, yes I am.
[291.86 → 301.34] In my Father's house, there's a place for me.
[301.34 → 308.62] I'm a child of God, yes I am.
[308.62 → 326.10] I am a child of God, yes I am.
[326.10 → 332.10] I am a child of God, yes I am.
[332.10 → 347.78] I am chosen, not forsaken.
[347.78 → 351.46] I am who You say I am.
[351.46 → 356.54] You are for me, not against me.

[364.82 → 368.54] I am who You say I am.
[368.54 → 373.42] You are for me, not against me.
[373.42 → 376.82] I am who You say I am.
[376.82 → 381.70] I am chosen, not forsaken.
[381.70 → 385.14] I am who You say I am.
[385.14 → 390.14] You are for me, not against me.
[390.14 → 393.86] I am who You say I am.
[393.86 → 397.86] Oh, I am who You say I am.
[397.86 → 404.14] Yes, I am who You say I am.
[404.14 → 409.14] I am who You say I am.
[409.14 → 412.86] Oh, I am who You say I am.
[412.86 → 417.14] I am who You say I am.
[417.14 → 422.14] Yes, I am who You say I am.
[422.14 → 424.14] Yes, I am.
[424.14 → 426.14] Yes, I am.
[426.14 → 430.14] Yes, I am.
[430.14 → 434.14] Yes, I am.
[434.14 → 440.14] Yes, I am.
[440.14 → 451.38] Thank you, and thank God for calling me!
[470.14 → 500.12] Thank you.
[500.14 → 530.12] Thank you.
[530.14 → 560.12] Thank you.
[560.14 → 590.12] Thank you.
[590.14 → 620.12] Thank you.
[620.14 → 622.14] Thank you.
[650.14 → 652.14] Thank you.
[680.14 → 682.14] Thank you.
[710.14 → 712.14] Thank you.
[740.14 → 742.14] Thank you.
[742.14 → 744.14] Thank you.
[744.14 → 746.14] Thank you.
[746.14 → 748.14] Thank you.
[748.14 → 750.14] Thank you.
[750.14 → 752.14] Thank you.
[752.14 → 754.14] Thank you.
[754.14 → 756.14] Thank you.
[756.14 → 758.14] Thank you.
[758.14 → 760.14] Thank you.
[760.14 → 762.14] Thank you.
[762.14 → 764.14] Thank you.
[764.14 → 766.14] Thank you.
[766.14 → 768.14] Thank you.
[768.14 → 770.14] Good morning.
[770.14 → 773.72] and some invitations in your mailboxes.
[774.16 → 777.52] They are from an organization called Safe Families Canada,
[777.74 → 779.76] which I have recently joined.
[780.70 → 782.54] Boy, I think I'm nervous or something.
[783.96 → 787.44] Anyway, just to give you some more information about Safe Families,
[787.78 → 792.92] it is an international, inter-denominational Christian organization
[792.92 → 797.82] that has some goals about keeping families safe,
[797.82 → 799.28] keeping children safe.
[800.14 → 805.72] Their three main goals are to keep children safe during a family crisis,
[805.94 → 810.88] such as homelessness or a hospitalization, or domestic violence,
[811.20 → 814.98] in an effort to prevent child abuse and or neglect.
[816.28 → 820.58] The second goal is to support and stabilize families in crisis
[820.58 → 824.82] by surrounding them with caring, compassionate community.
[824.82 → 828.78] Now, that is something that we do as a church,
[828.78 → 830.46] with our own church families,
[830.64 → 838.10] so Safe Families is hoping to expand that to the families that are in our communities.
[839.24 → 843.86] The third goal is to reunite families and reduce the number of children
[843.86 → 846.24] that are entering the child welfare system.
[846.24 → 851.72] We seek to be an alternative to foster care where appropriate.
[851.72 → 859.04] Now, I also know many families here in our midst have experienced the foster care system,
[859.04 → 864.98] and this is an alternative to that if it is safe to do so.
[864.98 → 866.78] Thank you.
[866.78 → 866.82] Thank you.
[866.82 → 866.84] Thank you.
[866.84 → 866.98] Thank you.
[866.98 → 867.84] Thank you.
[867.84 → 872.72] Oh, I wanted to remind you that we are having information evenings this coming weekend,
[872.72 → 878.78] Thursday in Sardis Baptist Church,
[878.78 → 883.66] and on Friday at New Life CRC in Abbotsford,
[883.66 → 889.14] and on Saturday night at the Canadian Reformed Church across the highway.
[889.66 → 892.72] So please come on out, get some more information, have some goodies,
[893.66 → 896.64] have a chance to ask some questions,
[897.36 → 904.60] see if this is something that you as individuals and as a church might be wanting to be involved in.
[904.60 → 905.16] Thank you.
[908.36 → 909.18] Thank you, Sylvia.
[909.68 → 912.68] If you have any questions about that, in addition to what you found in your mailbox,
[912.68 → 915.60] you can grab Sylvia, and she will answer them for you.
[917.36 → 922.92] Also, this coming Saturday, we are marking Coldest Night of the Year,
[923.04 → 927.84] an opportunity to support the work of the Salvation Army and Gateway of Hope
[927.84 → 932.58] in their dealing with people who are experiencing issues of housing or homelessness.
[932.58 → 935.96] And so we are gathering as a group to walk.
[936.12 → 938.78] There's still a chance to sign up and join the group.
[939.20 → 943.68] There's information in the e-bulletin, or you can grab Nikki here who will help explain some of that.
[943.96 → 947.98] And there's still a chance to donate to help people reach goals.
[948.42 → 952.30] And the Robert's have set a really impressive personal goal and challenge.
[952.30 → 956.02] And so ask the Robert girls about those details,
[956.02 → 959.76] and they will help you and encourage you to support them,
[959.76 → 962.90] because I think you're going to want to see them reach their goal.
[963.32 → 964.38] But I'm not going to say any more.
[964.82 → 966.04] Isla, you can explain it later.
[967.18 → 968.16] Isla's terrified now.
[968.16 → 974.08] Also, tonight is the young adult potluck.
[974.56 → 978.00] So if you're a young adult, or if you feel like a young adult,
[979.02 → 982.62] join us at 6.30, or join them at 6.30,
[982.66 → 984.40] because I don't feel like a young adult anymore,
[984.94 → 989.04] at 6.30 here at church for a potluck together.
[989.38 → 992.70] Now, I do want to say that they interpret potluck very generously.
[992.70 → 995.78] So if you bring 40 nuggets, you're welcome.
[997.78 → 1000.56] I think that's it for announcements this morning.
[1001.58 → 1005.74] Can we stand together, as we're welcomed by God in his presence?
[1012.62 → 1016.98] After you receive God's greeting, I invite you to turn to those around you,
[1017.04 → 1019.88] and with whom you're worshipping, and welcome them into worship.
[1019.88 → 1022.68] You can do that with a handshake, or a fist bump, or a head nod,
[1023.02 → 1023.80] however you like.
[1023.86 → 1026.08] Just welcome them into the presence of God together.
[1026.46 → 1027.86] Receive God's greeting.
[1029.16 → 1032.36] Grace, mercy, and peace to you,
[1032.60 → 1034.74] from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1034.82 → 1036.36] his Son, and our Saviour,
[1036.82 → 1039.30] through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[1040.52 → 1040.88] Amen.
[1040.88 → 1041.04] Amen.
[1049.88 → 1050.46] Amen.
[1058.52 → 1058.56] Amen.
[1058.58 → 1060.26] Amen.
[1060.26 → 1080.54] Good morning.
[1081.02 → 1086.02] We are called here this morning with a reading from Revelation 19.
[1086.02 → 1095.26] Then I heard what sounded like a great multitude, like the roar of rushing waters and like loud peals of thunder, shouting,
[1095.72 → 1102.98] Hallelujah, for our Lord God Almighty reigns. Let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory.
[1103.48 → 1108.02] For the wedding of the Lamb has come, and his bride has made herself ready.
[1108.70 → 1115.36] This is a beautiful picture of our church in that wedding feast, adding our voice to that thunderous shout.
[1115.36 → 1118.36] Our Lord God Almighty reigns.
[1145.36 → 1147.36] Thank you.
[1147.36 → 1148.36] Thank you.
[1148.36 → 1150.36] Thank you.
[1150.36 → 1152.36] Thank you.
[1152.36 → 1154.96] Hearts are
[1154.96 → 1157.30] During for you
[1157.30 → 1161.02] We long for you
[1161.02 → 1164.80] Through you, sweet you
[1164.80 → 1166.38] We find a frame
[1166.38 → 1168.60] To face the pain
[1168.60 → 1171.92] In your presence
[1171.92 → 1175.48] All our fears are washed away
[1175.48 → 1178.36] Washed away
[1178.36 → 1182.64] Hosanna
[1182.64 → 1186.04] Hosanna
[1186.04 → 1190.16] You are the God who saves us
[1190.16 → 1193.52] Worthy of all our praises
[1193.52 → 1197.24] Hosanna
[1197.24 → 1200.64] Hosanna
[1200.64 → 1204.76] Come have your way above us
[1204.76 → 1208.00] Welcome you here, Lord Jesus
[1208.00 → 1212.28] Hosanna
[1212.28 → 1215.68] Hear the sound of God
[1215.68 → 1219.50] Return to you
[1219.50 → 1222.72] Return to you
[1223.28 → 1229.10] In your kingdom
[1229.10 → 1233.38] Broken lines are made you
[1233.38 → 1237.58] You make us new
[1237.58 → 1241.48] When we see you
[1241.48 → 1244.78] We find strength to fight today
[1244.78 → 1248.38] In your presence
[1248.38 → 1252.66] All our fears are washed away
[1252.66 → 1254.06] Washed away
[1254.06 → 1258.34] Hosanna
[1258.34 → 1259.34] Hosanna
[1259.34 → 1260.34] Hosanna
[1260.34 → 1260.74] Hosanna
[1260.74 → 1261.74] Hosanna
[1261.74 → 1265.74] You are the God who saves us
[1265.74 → 1269.54] Worthy of all our praises
[1269.54 → 1272.34] Hosanna
[1272.34 → 1272.74] Hosanna
[1272.74 → 1276.32] Hosanna
[1276.54 → 1277.62] Hosanna
[1278.02 → 1280.28] Come have your way above us
[1280.28 → 1280.42] What to God
[1280.42 → 1283.28] Come with you here, Lord Jesus
[1283.28 → 1283.62] Hosanna
[1283.62 → 1284.58] You are the God who saves us
[1284.58 → 1285.38] Pimentos
[1285.38 → 1285.90] Hosanna
[1285.90 → 1286.70] Hosanna
[1286.70 → 1287.36] Hosanna
[1287.36 → 1287.52] former Jesus
[1287.52 → 1293.76] Hosanna
[1293.76 → 1294.76] Hosanna
[1294.76 → 1295.18] You are the God who saves us
[1295.18 → 1299.38] Worthy of all our praises
[1299.38 → 1302.20] Hosanna
[1302.20 → 1305.58] Hosanna
[1305.58 → 1309.68] From a new way above us
[1309.68 → 1312.94] Welcome you here for Jesus
[1325.18 → 1344.98] There is an endless song
[1344.98 → 1348.70] That goes in my soul
[1348.70 → 1354.70] I hear the music ring
[1354.70 → 1358.54] When the storm is coming
[1358.54 → 1362.92] I am holding on
[1362.92 → 1368.24] To the rock I cling
[1368.24 → 1376.12] How can I keep from singing your praise?
[1376.12 → 1380.06] How can I ever say love
[1380.06 → 1384.36] How amazing is your love
[1384.36 → 1389.70] How can I keep from shouting your name?
[1389.70 → 1393.98] I know I'm loved by the King
[1393.98 → 1397.92] And it makes my heart
[1397.92 → 1403.26] What a dream
[1403.26 → 1411.20] Lift my eyes in the darkest night
[1411.20 → 1416.54] And I will walk with you
[1416.54 → 1421.88] And I will walk with you
[1421.88 → 1426.16] And when you'll see me through
[1426.16 → 1431.50] I will sing the song
[1431.50 → 1436.38] How can I keep from singing your praise?
[1436.38 → 1441.38] How can I ever say love
[1441.38 → 1445.44] How amazing is your love?
[1445.44 → 1450.32] How can I keep from shouting your name?
[1450.32 → 1454.60] I know I'm loved by the King
[1454.60 → 1455.94] And I will sing
[1455.94 → 1458.88] And it makes my heart
[1458.88 → 1460.22] I will sing
[1460.22 → 1465.84] I can sing in the troubled times
[1465.84 → 1468.56] Sing when I win
[1468.56 → 1472.50] I can sing when I lose my step
[1472.50 → 1475.30] Fall down again
[1475.30 → 1477.64] I can sing when I sing
[1477.64 → 1480.64] I can sing when I win
[1480.64 → 1482.94] I can sing when you pick me up
[1482.94 → 1485.52] I can sing when you hear me Lord
[1485.52 → 1488.74] When I call to you in prayer
[1488.74 → 1492.16] I can sing with my last breath
[1492.16 → 1495.12] Sing for I know
[1495.12 → 1502.10] That I'll sing with the angels and the saints of the throne.
[1504.32 → 1509.46] How can I keep from singing your praise?
[1510.12 → 1513.26] How can I ever say enough?
[1513.92 → 1516.68] How amazing is your love?
[1517.76 → 1522.40] How can I keep from shouting your name?
[1522.40 → 1530.24] I know I'm loved by the King, and He fakes my heart.
[1530.24 → 1536.82] I am loved by the King, and He fakes my heart.
[1537.00 → 1543.74] I am loved by the King, and He fakes my heart.
[1544.14 → 1546.66] What a shame.
[1548.66 → 1551.34] I invite you to be seated for a couple of minutes.
[1552.40 → 1552.84] Amen.
[1557.34 → 1562.32] Our confession and assurance is coming to us from Psalm 37 this morning.
[1563.12 → 1569.14] Do not fret because of those who are evil or be envious of those who do wrong.
[1570.14 → 1572.60] For like the grass, they will soon wither.
[1573.08 → 1575.76] Like green plants, they will soon die away.
[1575.76 → 1578.84] Trust in the Lord and do good.
[1579.54 → 1582.44] Dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture.
[1583.32 → 1587.62] Take delight in the Lord, and He will give you the desires of your heart.
[1588.72 → 1590.06] Commit your way to the Lord.
[1590.66 → 1592.74] Trust in Him and He will do this.
[1593.48 → 1596.56] He will make your righteous reward shine like the dawn.
[1597.26 → 1599.74] Your vindication like the noonday sun.
[1599.74 → 1603.88] Trust in the Lord and do good.
[1604.56 → 1605.86] Take delight in the Lord.
[1606.62 → 1608.22] Commit your way to the Lord.
[1609.18 → 1612.24] As we look at the year ahead, we may ask ourselves,
[1612.24 → 1616.00] what will make this coming year a success?
[1617.00 → 1623.12] At the end of the year, what will be the markers along the way that indicate we had a successful year?
[1624.40 → 1626.80] Here's a list of things that we might like to see happen.
[1626.80 → 1635.36] From holidays to hobbies, healthy living to sports, financial security to volunteering.
[1636.34 → 1638.58] These may be the desires of our hearts.
[1639.24 → 1645.60] As we consider this list, it strikes me that maybe we're focusing on the wrong things.
[1646.58 → 1650.28] God didn't say, tell me your heart's desires, and I'll make it happen.
[1650.28 → 1654.72] He is saying, trust in me and do good.
[1655.28 → 1656.48] Take delight in me.
[1657.30 → 1661.06] Commit your way to me and I will give you the desires of your heart.
[1661.82 → 1667.32] In this passage, God is telling us to stop trying to do live on our own and to trust in Him.
[1668.06 → 1673.30] To commit our ways to Him and to get back to taking delight in Him.
[1673.92 → 1675.66] And He will make your life rich.
[1680.28 → 1706.04] I am weak but Thou art strong.
[1706.04 → 1712.04] Jesus, keep me from all wrong.
[1712.04 → 1718.04] I'll be satisfied as long.
[1718.94 → 1724.04] As I walk, let me walk close to Thee.
[1725.68 → 1730.04] Just a closer walk with Thee.
[1732.04 → 1735.80] Granted, Jesus, is my plea.
[1736.04 → 1742.04] Dear Lord, let me walk close to Thee.
[1742.04 → 1748.04] Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.
[1748.04 → 1755.24] Through this world of toil and snares,
[1755.24 → 1757.24] If I falter, Lord, let it be.
[1757.24 → 1760.84] If I falter, Lord, who cares?
[1761.24 → 1766.10] Oh, will they my heart and chest?
[1766.24 → 1772.02] None but Thee, dear Lord, none but Thee.
[1772.02 → 1778.02] Just a closer walk with Thee.
[1778.02 → 1780.02] Granted, Jesus, is my plea.
[1780.02 → 1784.02] Granted, Jesus, is my plea.
[1784.02 → 1789.02] Daily walking close to Thee.
[1789.02 → 1795.02] Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.
[1795.02 → 1802.02] When my feeble life is o'er.
[1802.02 → 1807.02] Damn for me will be no more.
[1807.02 → 1813.02] Guide me gently, safely o'er.
[1813.02 → 1814.02] Always come, who does it?
[1814.02 → 1842.02] 운데, hands and AUDIENCE who cares
[1842.02 → 1847.60] Please pray with me.
[1851.74 → 1856.98] Father, it's so easy to plan our life without considering you.
[1858.50 → 1862.54] We focus on us and what we want out of life,
[1863.06 → 1865.86] and to spend all our energies making it happen.
[1867.56 → 1870.70] It seems so different from what you offer.
[1872.62 → 1875.30] Forgive us for our selfish ways,
[1875.76 → 1878.10] for not trusting in your love for us,
[1878.58 → 1881.48] for not even considering you in our life plans.
[1883.70 → 1887.08] Father, help us to take the focus off of us
[1887.08 → 1889.86] and help us commit our ways to you.
[1890.70 → 1893.54] Help us trust in you and do good.
[1894.42 → 1895.88] Capture us with your beauty.
[1896.54 → 1898.48] Draw us to you with your love.
[1898.48 → 1904.42] So we again will take pure delight in you.
[1905.74 → 1906.42] Amen.
[1906.42 → 1908.84] Thank you.
[1909.74 → 1911.88] Thank you.
[1911.88 → 1936.18] O God, you are my God, and I will ever praise you.
[1936.18 → 1945.74] O God, you are my God, and I will ever praise you.
[1946.40 → 1955.62] I will seek you in the morning, and I will learn to walk in your way.
[1955.62 → 1965.48] And step by step, you lead me, and I will follow you all of my days.
[1966.18 → 1973.74] You are my God, and I will ever praise you.
[1974.84 → 1982.92] O God, you are my God, and I will ever praise you.
[1982.92 → 1992.54] I will seek you in the morning, and I will learn to walk in your way.
[1992.54 → 2001.48] And step by step, you lead me, and I will follow you all of my days.
[2001.48 → 2006.16] And I will follow you all of my days.
[2006.16 → 2011.10] And I will follow you all of my days.
[2011.10 → 2020.54] And step by step, you lead me, and I will follow you all of my days.
[2020.54 → 2050.52] I will follow you all of my days.
[2050.52 → 2052.52] I will follow you all of my days.
[2052.52 → 2057.52] I will follow you all of my days.
[2057.52 → 2061.52] I will follow you all of my days.
[2061.52 → 2068.52] Jesus, the name above every other name.
[2068.52 → 2087.52] Jesus, the only one who could ever say.
[2087.52 → 2094.52] Jesus, the only one who could ever say.
[2094.52 → 2096.52] We live for you.
[2096.52 → 2099.52] We live for you.
[2099.52 → 2100.52] We live for you.
[2100.52 → 2106.52] Holy, there is no one like you.
[2106.52 → 2109.52] There is none beside you.

[2162.52 → 2175.52] Holy, there is no one like you.
[2175.52 → 2178.52] There is none beside you.
[2178.52 → 2197.52] Open up your eyes in wonder, and show me who you are, and fill me with your heart, and lead me in your love to those around me.
[2197.52 → 2217.22] I will build my life upon your love
[2217.22 → 2222.24] It is a life temptation
[2222.24 → 2229.86] And I will put my trust in you alone
[2229.86 → 2235.06] And I will not be shaken
[2235.06 → 2242.48] And I will build my life upon your love
[2242.48 → 2247.44] It is a life temptation
[2247.44 → 2255.06] And I will not trust in you alone
[2255.06 → 2261.60] And I will not be shaken and fallen
[2261.60 → 2265.24] There is no one like you
[2265.24 → 2268.06] There is none beside you
[2268.06 → 2273.40] Open up my eyes in wonder
[2273.40 → 2277.10] And show me who you are

[2280.50 → 2283.88] And lead me in your love
[2283.88 → 2288.06] To those around me
[2288.06 → 2309.40] Worthy is not

[2313.30 → 2317.86] Holy, holy is he
[2317.86 → 2323.16] Sing a new song

[2476.44 → 2479.30] Filled with wonder
[2479.30 → 2482.38] Awestruck wonder
[2482.38 → 2488.70] At the mention of your name

[2492.14 → 2493.10] Jesus, your name is power
[2493.10 → 2496.30] Breath and living water

[2546.30 → 2550.30] I will adore you
[2550.30 → 2552.30] I will adore you
[2552.30 → 2562.00] Good morning
[2562.00 → 2564.06] My name is Clem
[2564.06 → 2565.00] And I'm one of the deacons
[2565.00 → 2565.72] Here at Emmanuel
[2565.72 → 2568.78] The first offering
[2568.78 → 2570.34] Is for Langley's
[2570.34 → 2572.06] Emmanuel's ministries
[2572.06 → 2572.58] And missions
[2572.58 → 2573.46] And the second
[2573.46 → 2574.68] Is for spring
[2574.68 → 2576.18] Mexico missions
[2576.18 → 2577.94] And Brandon will
[2577.94 → 2579.16] Have something to say
[2579.16 → 2579.64] About that
[2579.64 → 2581.98] Good morning
[2581.98 → 2583.80] So this is actually
[2583.80 → 2584.40] Because I actually have
[2584.40 → 2585.36] A couple announcements too
[2585.36 → 2586.16] So we thought we'd do it
[2586.16 → 2586.58] All at one
[2586.58 → 2587.50] And I don't go up and down
[2587.50 → 2588.02] A bunch of times
[2588.02 → 2590.52] But so we got a couple of things
[2590.52 → 2591.52] Two announcements
[2591.52 → 2592.64] Offering of course
[2592.64 → 2593.14] And a thank you
[2593.14 → 2593.74] And I always think
[2593.74 → 2595.20] When you ask people for money
[2595.20 → 2595.82] The thank you is probably
[2595.82 → 2596.60] The best to start with
[2596.60 → 2598.16] So start with that
[2598.16 → 2601.00] I know January to March
[2601.00 → 2602.94] Can be a lot
[2602.94 → 2603.72] In terms of Mexico
[2603.72 → 2605.54] We constantly come to you guys
[2605.54 → 2606.38] We're asking for money
[2606.38 → 2608.56] We have Mexico dinners
[2608.56 → 2609.74] We have fundraisers
[2609.74 → 2610.32] We have the youth
[2610.32 → 2611.42] Pestering you individually
[2611.42 → 2613.20] We do these offerings
[2613.20 → 2613.92] Things like that
[2613.92 → 2615.08] I really appreciate
[2615.08 → 2615.96] Is you guys every year
[2615.96 → 2617.80] For the last 27 years
[2617.80 → 2618.70] Or whatever we've done this
[2618.70 → 2619.90] Have stepped up every time
[2619.90 → 2621.36] And we've never had
[2621.36 → 2622.84] Us not meeting our budget
[2622.84 → 2624.40] It's just really cool to see
[2624.40 → 2625.36] And I thank you guys for it
[2625.36 → 2625.86] You guys always
[2625.86 → 2626.90] It just shows how
[2626.90 → 2628.04] Much this church
[2628.04 → 2628.82] Supports this mission
[2628.82 → 2629.76] And believes in it
[2629.76 → 2631.16] So I really thank you guys
[2631.16 → 2631.56] For that
[2631.56 → 2632.96] I mean just to say
[2632.96 → 2634.00] Like 17 years ago
[2634.00 → 2634.80] When I went as a youth
[2634.80 → 2635.90] The trip cost $1,000
[2635.90 → 2637.98] Despite inflation
[2637.98 → 2639.24] COVID and all these things
[2639.24 → 2641.02] The trip only cost $11.50
[2641.02 → 2642.00] 17 years later
[2642.00 → 2643.42] We barely had to raise
[2643.42 → 2644.20] The trip cost
[2644.20 → 2644.80] Because you guys
[2644.80 → 2645.44] Are so generous
[2645.44 → 2646.86] And cover so much
[2646.86 → 2647.54] Of that general
[2647.54 → 2648.60] Ministry funds
[2648.60 → 2649.76] That we don't need
[2649.76 → 2650.32] To raise the price
[2650.32 → 2651.60] So thank you for that
[2651.60 → 2652.68] And other notes
[2652.68 → 2653.52] The announcements
[2653.52 → 2655.08] Neufeld fundraiser
[2655.08 → 2656.20] A lot of you
[2656.20 → 2656.76] Ordered from youth
[2656.76 → 2657.18] But some of you
[2657.18 → 2657.82] Also ordered from
[2657.82 → 2658.72] Just the general trip
[2658.72 → 2659.06] As well
[2659.06 → 2659.42] If you weren't
[2659.42 → 2660.38] Contacted by youth
[2660.38 → 2661.94] For those people
[2661.94 → 2663.50] This coming Saturday
[2663.50 → 2664.22] The 25th
[2664.22 → 2664.88] The pickup time
[2664.88 → 2666.10] Will be at 2.30
[2666.10 → 2666.74] For your order
[2666.74 → 2669.22] Please don't show up early
[2669.22 → 2670.98] Just trying to skip the line-up
[2670.98 → 2671.50] And trying to get out
[2671.50 → 2671.92] Of their faster
[2671.92 → 2672.34] Because the food
[2672.34 → 2673.30] Will still be on the truck
[2673.30 → 2674.80] So you will not be
[2674.80 → 2675.60] Leaving early
[2675.60 → 2676.70] You'll be just waiting around
[2676.70 → 2677.66] The youth will still
[2677.66 → 2678.44] Be unloading the truck
[2678.44 → 2679.12] And getting it all ready
[2679.12 → 2679.62] For you guys
[2679.62 → 2679.86] So
[2679.86 → 2681.92] The second one
[2681.92 → 2683.26] Is Mexico dinner
[2683.26 → 2684.54] It's that time of year again
[2684.54 → 2686.42] That will be two weeks from now
[2686.42 → 2687.16] March 4th
[2687.16 → 2687.96] To Saturday there
[2687.96 → 2689.12] Sign up is going to be
[2689.12 → 2689.46] In the back
[2689.46 → 2690.70] By the connections table there
[2690.70 → 2691.80] It will just be another
[2691.80 → 2692.66] Just kind of great time
[2692.66 → 2693.24] To hang out
[2693.24 → 2694.84] Just kind of have
[2694.84 → 2695.60] Community here
[2695.60 → 2696.58] And have dinner together
[2696.58 → 2697.22] And as well
[2697.22 → 2698.20] Support the youth
[2698.20 → 2699.20] And the spring
[2699.20 → 2700.16] Mexico missions trip
[2700.16 → 2701.68] It will be tacos again
[2701.68 → 2702.92] Tickets are again
[2702.92 → 2703.96] It's by donation
[2703.96 → 2705.08] We do recommend
[2705.08 → 2705.48] $20
[2705.48 → 2706.78] So we can cover our costs
[2706.78 → 2707.10] At least
[2707.10 → 2708.56] But it's by donation
[2708.56 → 2709.28] For every person
[2709.28 → 2710.90] And then I think
[2710.90 → 2711.96] Kids we don't really charge for
[2711.96 → 2712.30] So
[2712.30 → 2713.58] That's the Mexico dinner
[2713.58 → 2715.40] So they also
[2715.40 → 2716.32] The deacons asked me
[2716.32 → 2716.86] To kind of speak
[2716.86 → 2717.92] About what the trip is
[2717.92 → 2718.88] What we do
[2718.88 → 2720.14] Kind of where your
[2720.14 → 2721.26] Guys' money goes to
[2721.26 → 2721.78] And all that
[2721.78 → 2722.14] So
[2722.14 → 2723.68] I figure to kind of
[2723.68 → 2724.10] Start with
[2724.10 → 2724.80] Every year we
[2724.80 → 2725.44] For the
[2725.44 → 2727.18] Last ten years or so
[2727.18 → 2727.46] We
[2727.46 → 2728.14] Our motto
[2728.14 → 2728.80] Theme
[2728.80 → 2729.48] Mission statement
[2729.48 → 2730.02] Of the trip
[2730.02 → 2731.20] Has been community
[2731.20 → 2732.76] Our goal is to build
[2732.76 → 2733.22] Community
[2733.22 → 2734.82] With the people down
[2734.82 → 2735.20] In Mexico
[2735.20 → 2735.92] In our church
[2735.92 → 2736.92] As well as the
[2736.92 → 2737.62] Church in Mexico
[2737.62 → 2738.22] That we support
[2738.22 → 2739.04] And their surrounding
[2739.04 → 2739.54] Community
[2739.54 → 2741.26] So to go with that
[2741.26 → 2741.88] We always choose
[2741.88 → 2742.48] A bible verse
[2742.48 → 2743.18] That just kind of
[2743.18 → 2744.12] Fits what our
[2744.12 → 2744.62] Mission statement
[2744.62 → 2745.46] For this year is
[2745.46 → 2746.62] And this year we
[2746.62 → 2747.64] Chose Romans 12
[2747.64 → 2748.32] Verse 16
[2748.32 → 2749.16] Which is
[2749.16 → 2749.74] Live in harmony
[2749.74 → 2750.42] With one another
[2750.42 → 2751.72] Do not be proud
[2751.72 → 2752.74] But be willing
[2752.74 → 2753.46] To associate with
[2753.46 → 2754.36] People of low position
[2754.36 → 2756.06] And do not be conceited
[2756.06 → 2758.64] This year that kind of
[2758.64 → 2759.74] Rings home more than ever
[2759.74 → 2761.54] As Mexico has changed
[2761.54 → 2762.36] A lot over the last
[2762.36 → 2762.74] Ten years
[2762.74 → 2763.28] Since we've been
[2763.28 → 2764.06] Working with Abi lino
[2764.06 → 2765.46] The economy has gone up
[2765.46 → 2766.86] A lot of the church
[2766.86 → 2767.20] Members
[2767.20 → 2768.06] The church has grown
[2768.06 → 2768.42] To now
[2768.42 → 2768.96] It's almost 100
[2768.96 → 2770.64] Professing adult members
[2770.64 → 2770.94] Now
[2770.94 → 2772.68] It's grown huge
[2772.68 → 2773.48] They're doing better
[2773.48 → 2774.12] They of course
[2774.12 → 2774.94] Are still in poverty
[2774.94 → 2776.44] But the big change
[2776.44 → 2777.40] We saw when me
[2777.40 → 2778.44] Chris, Kevin
[2778.44 → 2778.84] And Aaron
[2778.84 → 2779.34] Went down
[2779.34 → 2780.72] In this past winter
[2780.72 → 2782.12] Is a bunch of
[2782.12 → 2782.82] Migrants have now
[2782.82 → 2783.26] Moved in
[2783.26 → 2783.80] Immigrants from
[2783.80 → 2784.54] South America
[2784.54 → 2786.52] Who are fleeing wars
[2786.52 → 2787.22] Things like that
[2787.22 → 2787.70] Famine
[2787.70 → 2788.88] They've moved into
[2788.88 → 2789.20] Mexico
[2789.20 → 2789.78] And they've actually
[2789.78 → 2790.36] Moved into
[2790.36 → 2791.24] Abi lino's community
[2791.24 → 2791.96] And they have taken
[2791.96 → 2792.86] Over any square inch
[2792.86 → 2793.32] Of the land
[2793.32 → 2794.56] What that means
[2794.56 → 2795.28] Is cosmetically
[2795.28 → 2795.96] As well as just
[2795.96 → 2797.26] Actually physically
[2797.26 → 2798.66] The financial situation
[2798.66 → 2799.02] In Mexico
[2799.02 → 2800.12] Has gone back
[2800.12 → 2800.88] 20 years
[2800.88 → 2801.38] Essentially
[2801.38 → 2802.86] In this area
[2802.86 → 2804.42] There are shacks again
[2804.42 → 2806.16] There's you know
[2806.16 → 2807.28] Ten-person families
[2807.28 → 2808.12] Living in a
[2808.12 → 2810.32] Maybe the size of the piano
[2810.32 → 2811.50] Shack kind of thing
[2811.50 → 2812.82] It's just a bedroom
[2812.82 → 2813.42] There's no kitchen
[2813.42 → 2814.24] There's no running water
[2814.24 → 2815.00] There are no toilets
[2815.00 → 2815.76] Things like that
[2815.76 → 2817.04] So Mexico has really
[2817.04 → 2818.52] Gone back a long ways
[2818.52 → 2819.54] And this was something
[2819.54 → 2820.68] Abi lino even struggled
[2820.68 → 2821.20] With himself
[2821.20 → 2821.92] As they've put in
[2821.92 → 2822.56] So much work
[2822.56 → 2823.94] Into this community
[2823.94 → 2824.58] And so much love
[2824.58 → 2825.16] And blood and sweat
[2825.16 → 2825.54] And tears
[2825.54 → 2826.24] And now it's like
[2826.24 → 2827.16] Everything's kind of
[2827.16 → 2827.74] Gone back
[2827.74 → 2828.46] I mean their soccer
[2828.46 → 2829.12] Fields are gone
[2829.12 → 2829.50] Because they got
[2829.50 → 2830.32] Taken over by the
[2830.32 → 2830.76] Immigrants
[2830.76 → 2832.40] As everything's
[2832.40 → 2832.98] Changed again
[2832.98 → 2833.78] And I think
[2833.78 → 2834.56] What was really cool
[2834.56 → 2835.50] Is this year's trip
[2835.50 → 2837.08] Besides myself
[2837.08 → 2837.54] And my wife
[2837.54 → 2838.12] Nobody's actually
[2838.12 → 2838.78] Been to Mexico
[2838.78 → 2839.90] In the last 10 years
[2839.90 → 2841.08] And never actually
[2841.08 → 2841.94] Worked in this community
[2841.94 → 2843.32] None of the youth
[2843.32 → 2843.96] None of the adults
[2843.96 → 2844.36] They've gone
[2844.36 → 2845.02] The adults have gone
[2845.02 → 2845.66] On the trip before
[2845.66 → 2847.74] But with the Sandoval's
[2847.74 → 2849.14] So they
[2849.14 → 2849.96] Not knowing
[2849.96 → 2850.36] The kind of
[2850.36 → 2851.22] Economic situation
[2851.22 → 2851.44] Everything
[2851.44 → 2852.10] They really chose
[2852.10 → 2852.96] A cool bible verse
[2852.96 → 2854.48] That fits the needs
[2854.48 → 2855.08] And what we're
[2855.08 → 2855.42] Going to be doing
[2855.42 → 2855.78] This year
[2855.78 → 2856.26] Which is kind of
[2856.26 → 2857.12] Going back to square one
[2857.12 → 2858.54] And a lot more
[2858.54 → 2859.30] Evangelizing
[2859.30 → 2860.74] And helping the people
[2860.74 → 2861.46] Kind of come to
[2861.46 → 2862.16] Meet God again
[2862.16 → 2863.62] It's kind of like
[2863.62 → 2864.62] Starting back 10 years ago
[2864.62 → 2865.08] When the church
[2865.08 → 2865.86] Was eight people
[2865.86 → 2867.40] But now we're doing it
[2867.40 → 2867.92] With partnership
[2867.92 → 2868.64] Of 100 people
[2868.64 → 2869.06] And trying to
[2869.06 → 2869.96] Expand that church again
[2869.96 → 2871.00] And take care of
[2871.00 → 2871.90] The needs of these people
[2871.90 → 2872.70] That have moved here
[2872.70 → 2874.00] Fleeing war
[2874.00 → 2875.90] And fleeing the drug trade
[2875.90 → 2876.82] And things like that
[2876.82 → 2878.12] And now that they're
[2878.12 → 2878.86] Living in Abi lino's
[2878.86 → 2879.14] Community
[2879.14 → 2879.64] And trying to
[2879.64 → 2880.56] Row the community again
[2880.56 → 2880.92] So
[2880.92 → 2882.18] And it's going to be
[2882.18 → 2882.76] Again we're going to
[2882.76 → 2883.56] Be visiting with people
[2883.56 → 2884.34] Who live in sheds
[2884.34 → 2884.94] And it's going to be
[2884.94 → 2885.94] People of low position
[2885.94 → 2887.62] And people that
[2887.62 → 2888.06] You know when you
[2888.06 → 2888.66] See them on the street
[2888.66 → 2889.10] You would probably
[2889.10 → 2889.64] Go to the opposite
[2889.64 → 2890.24] Side of the street
[2890.24 → 2890.76] And avoid them
[2890.76 → 2891.36] And that's the people
[2891.36 → 2891.68] We're going to be
[2891.68 → 2892.46] Ministering to again
[2892.46 → 2893.56] So I think that's
[2893.56 → 2894.02] Going to be just
[2894.02 → 2895.82] A really cool part of it
[2895.82 → 2896.52] As well as why
[2896.52 → 2897.42] This verse
[2897.42 → 2898.36] Despite not knowing
[2898.36 → 2899.28] That really fit
[2899.28 → 2900.10] This year's trip
[2900.10 → 2900.56] So
[2900.56 → 2902.08] Thank you again
[2902.08 → 2903.10] For all your support guys
[2903.10 → 2903.94] Again we really
[2903.94 → 2904.68] Appreciate it
[2904.68 → 2905.38] It allows this trip
[2905.38 → 2906.02] To keep going
[2906.02 → 2906.90] Abi lino really
[2906.90 → 2908.46] Appreciates it as well
[2908.46 → 2910.32] It's just really
[2910.32 → 2911.86] Kind of moving moments
[2911.86 → 2912.56] For all of us youth
[2912.56 → 2913.20] As well as the people
[2913.20 → 2913.58] Down there
[2913.58 → 2914.44] And we all grow a lot
[2914.44 → 2915.24] In our walk of God
[2915.24 → 2915.66] For it
[2915.66 → 2915.96] So
[2915.96 → 2916.98] Thank you for your
[2916.98 → 2918.02] Financial support
[2918.02 → 2930.40] Dear God
[2930.40 → 2931.36] Thank you for everybody
[2931.36 → 2931.84] In this community
[2931.84 → 2932.12] Lord
[2932.12 → 2932.48] And everybody
[2932.48 → 2933.08] In this church
[2933.08 → 2934.54] Thank you for their
[2934.54 → 2935.34] Giving nature
[2935.34 → 2935.66] Lord
[2935.66 → 2936.08] And just their
[2936.08 → 2937.08] Constant willingness
[2937.08 → 2937.76] To support
[2937.76 → 2938.50] You know
[2938.50 → 2939.26] The Mexico trip
[2939.26 → 2939.74] As well as just
[2939.74 → 2940.52] This church community
[2940.52 → 2940.82] Lord
[2940.82 → 2941.78] And they always
[2941.78 → 2942.34] Step up for
[2942.34 → 2943.56] Everything that we need
[2943.56 → 2944.62] Lord
[2944.62 → 2945.00] Lord I pray
[2945.00 → 2945.42] That you be with
[2945.42 → 2946.08] The people in Mexico
[2946.08 → 2946.44] Lord
[2946.44 → 2947.44] The people that
[2947.44 → 2948.60] Are in this ministry
[2948.60 → 2949.16] That we do
[2949.16 → 2950.14] One week out of the year
[2950.14 → 2951.02] They do it every day
[2951.02 → 2952.42] Of their lives
[2952.42 → 2952.66] Lord
[2952.66 → 2953.46] And it can be
[2953.46 → 2954.64] Burdensome
[2954.64 → 2955.58] It can be tiresome
[2955.58 → 2956.64] And it can be
[2956.64 → 2958.10] Just a big strain
[2958.10 → 2958.60] On their lives
[2958.60 → 2958.76] Lord
[2958.76 → 2959.44] I pray that you
[2959.44 → 2960.20] Support them
[2960.20 → 2961.38] And you give them
[2961.38 → 2962.66] Their will
[2962.66 → 2963.66] And their kind of
[2963.66 → 2964.44] Fire to keep going
[2964.44 → 2964.72] Lord
[2964.72 → 2966.56] Please put your
[2966.56 → 2967.04] Guiding hand
[2967.04 → 2967.60] Over all of us
[2967.60 → 2967.84] Lord
[2967.84 → 2969.18] And as we leave
[2969.18 → 2969.82] Your church today
[2969.82 → 2970.20] As well
[2970.20 → 2970.70] That we
[2970.70 → 2971.70] We kind of live
[2971.70 → 2973.84] Live our church life
[2973.84 → 2975.06] In our regular life
[2975.06 → 2975.60] As well Lord
[2975.60 → 2976.06] And we don't
[2976.06 → 2977.44] Kind of forget about it
[2977.44 → 2978.36] We can minister to others
[2978.36 → 2979.24] Here right at home
[2979.24 → 2979.64] As well
[2979.64 → 2981.56] In Jesus name I pray
[2981.56 → 2981.88] Amen
[2997.84 → 3013.70] Like a fire
[3013.70 → 3017.32] Don't let my vision dry
[3017.32 → 3019.54] I'm calling out
[3019.54 → 3021.28] Like a fire
[3021.28 → 3022.32] I'm calling out
[3022.32 → 3035.38] Like a fire
[3035.38 → 3039.40] I need a discipline
[3039.40 → 3041.90] I'm calling out
[3041.90 → 3043.64] Like a fire
[3043.64 → 3044.44] I'm calling out
[3044.44 → 3045.54] Like a fire
[3045.54 → 3049.50] I'm calling out
[3049.50 → 3049.76] Like a fire
[3049.76 → 3079.74] Don't let my mind
[3079.74 → 3080.74] Like a fire
[3080.74 → 3081.70] I can't
[3081.70 → 3084.56] Don't let my vision dry
[3084.56 → 3086.46] I'm calling out
[3086.46 → 3088.32] Like a fire
[3088.32 → 3089.74] I can't
[3089.74 → 3095.30] I'm calling out
[3095.30 → 3098.40] In my heart
[3098.40 → 3099.22] My need
[3099.22 → 3101.24] I'm calling out
[3101.24 → 3103.06] Like a fire
[3103.06 → 3103.84] I can't
[3103.84 → 3104.74] Like a fire
[3104.74 → 3105.20] I need to
[3105.20 → 3106.50] In the blood
[3106.50 → 3108.64] I'm calling out
[3108.64 → 3112.04] Light the fire again
[3112.04 → 3116.92] I'm risen by gold
[3116.92 → 3119.04] Refined in the fire
[3119.04 → 3121.28] Taken and poor
[3121.28 → 3124.32] Wretched and blind I come
[3124.32 → 3126.38] Both in one
[3126.38 → 3130.36] So I will be in
[3130.36 → 3134.28] Lord, light the fire again
[3138.64 → 3168.32] I didn't even ask you guys to come forward
[3168.32 → 3169.70] And here you are
[3169.70 → 3171.14] Good job
[3171.14 → 3172.60] We're going to do some kids corner
[3172.60 → 3174.42] And then we're going to head to the back
[3174.42 → 3175.90] And do some children's worship time
[3175.90 → 3179.30] But I have to switch hands here
[3179.30 → 3182.44] You guys ready to say hi to Hank?
[3182.62 → 3183.68] You have to wake him up
[3183.68 → 3184.56] He's a little tired
[3184.56 → 3186.60] Say hi Hank really loudly
[3186.60 → 3188.16] Hi
[3188.16 → 3191.98] Hi everybody
[3191.98 → 3193.78] How are you doing today?
[3195.04 → 3195.52] Good
[3195.52 → 3197.20] Hank, guess what we're going to talk about today
[3197.20 → 3198.16] What's that?
[3198.32 → 3199.58] We are going to talk about
[3199.58 → 3202.80] One of the biggest underdogs in the Bible
[3202.80 → 3205.28] There are dogs in the Bible?
[3206.08 → 3207.42] Well, yes
[3207.42 → 3208.40] But not what you're thinking
[3208.40 → 3210.98] Well, what's the dogs in the Bible?
[3211.68 → 3213.38] Well, the dogs in the Bible are
[3213.38 → 3215.06] Actually what Jesus calls the Pharisees
[3215.06 → 3218.18] But we're going to talk about an underdog
[3218.18 → 3220.42] What's an underdog?
[3220.50 → 3221.22] Should we ask the kids?
[3222.02 → 3223.80] Kids, do you know what an underdog is?
[3223.80 → 3224.98] What's an underdog?
[3224.98 → 3226.24] Any idea?
[3226.24 → 3226.74] No?
[3226.74 → 3227.24] Ha!
[3227.24 → 3233.62] We can open up this, Ken, if you want
[3233.62 → 3236.34] Aren't the Canucks mostly an underdog?
[3236.34 → 3237.30] Yeah, they are
[3237.30 → 3244.02] Underdog is when you are maybe not supposed to win something
[3244.02 → 3244.60] Oh!
[3244.60 → 3252.66] So if you are in a sport and maybe your team is supposed to lose, and you're playing a really, perfect team
[3252.66 → 3254.12] That would be an underdog
[3254.12 → 3255.30] Oh, okay!
[3255.70 → 3258.52] But there's an underdog in the Bible that we're going to talk about
[3258.52 → 3263.24] Because he was volunteering to fight a giant
[3263.24 → 3266.30] And the giant was supposed to win
[3266.30 → 3267.66] Does anybody know that story?
[3267.90 → 3268.62] I think I do!
[3269.06 → 3269.68] What is it, Emma?
[3269.74 → 3270.08] Do you know?
[3273.26 → 3273.80] That's right!
[3273.86 → 3275.24] That was the giant, Goliath
[3275.24 → 3276.64] And what's the underdog's name?
[3276.70 → 3278.44] What's the little guy who was going to fight him?
[3279.20 → 3279.42] Yeah
[3279.42 → 3280.28] What is it?
[3282.70 → 3283.42] That's David!
[3283.52 → 3283.88] That's right!
[3283.92 → 3286.46] So we're going to talk about David and Goliath today, okay?
[3286.52 → 3287.14] Does that sound good?
[3287.42 → 3287.76] Yeah!
[3287.76 → 3289.30] So, yes, what's up, Zoe?
[3289.56 → 3291.16] That's my dad's name, Goliath
[3291.16 → 3292.38] Is it because his name's David?
[3292.76 → 3295.54] He's also a giant, so that's a little bit confusing, isn't it?
[3296.42 → 3298.18] All right, we're going to pray
[3298.18 → 3302.14] And then we're going to head off to children's worship time, okay?
[3302.26 → 3302.82] Sorry, Dave
[3302.82 → 3307.42] All right, let's fold our hands and close our eyes
[3307.42 → 3310.14] And then we'll pray, and we'll go to children's worship time, okay?
[3310.88 → 3311.20] All right
[3311.20 → 3312.76] Dear God, thank you for this day
[3312.76 → 3314.04] Thank you that we can come to church
[3314.04 → 3317.52] And that we can listen to the Bible and hear Bible stories
[3317.52 → 3319.46] And sing songs to you, Lord
[3319.46 → 3320.82] We pray that you'll be with us now
[3320.82 → 3322.78] As we learn more about the Bible
[3322.78 → 3324.50] And more about what it means to be
[3324.50 → 3326.62] Who you've created us to be
[3326.62 → 3328.20] Be with our parents, too
[3328.20 → 3329.30] As they stay in church
[3329.30 → 3330.84] And learn more about your word as well
[3330.84 → 3332.14] We pray this in your name
[3332.14 → 3332.70] Amen
[3332.70 → 3334.72] All right, let's stand up
[3334.72 → 3335.66] Say bye to Hank
[3335.66 → 3337.60] Bye, kids!
[3338.30 → 3339.64] All right, and now let's do
[3339.64 → 3340.74] The
[3340.74 → 3343.24] Children's blessing, okay?
[3343.24 → 3343.82] We're going to say
[3343.82 → 3345.24] The Lord be with you together
[3345.24 → 3345.74] Are you ready?
[3345.94 → 3346.44] Hands up
[3346.44 → 3347.98] And one, two, three
[3347.98 → 3350.14] The Lord be with you
[3373.24 → 3380.92] I just want to
[3380.92 → 3382.46] Is this on?
[3382.76 → 3383.32] Lights on
[3383.32 → 3385.38] I just want to
[3385.38 → 3387.26] Give a little
[3387.26 → 3388.74] Heads up
[3388.74 → 3390.86] We started our prayer ministry
[3390.86 → 3393.30] Much the same as we had before
[3393.30 → 3396.52] So the yellow cards that people wear
[3396.52 → 3397.36] Are these
[3397.36 → 3399.10] They tell me this is yellow
[3399.10 → 3400.52] So it's yellow
[3400.52 → 3404.26] I also want to give you a bit of heads up
[3404.26 → 3405.56] On some of the
[3405.56 → 3408.98] Situations that people are facing right now
[3408.98 → 3409.82] In our midst
[3409.82 → 3411.00] And out of our midst
[3411.00 → 3411.98] And the first one is
[3411.98 → 3414.92] Women Amy Iron used to be members here
[3414.92 → 3417.26] And Amy has cancer
[3417.26 → 3419.22] And it's already stage four
[3419.22 → 3421.58] I don't know a lot about the details
[3421.58 → 3422.76] But if some of you know her
[3422.76 → 3424.04] Just give her a call
[3424.04 → 3426.60] Pete
[3426.60 → 3428.56] I want to be with Pete
[3428.56 → 3429.54] And his entire family
[3429.54 → 3430.58] His mom's in the hospital
[3430.58 → 3431.90] She's been there for a week or two
[3431.90 → 3433.06] She's not doing well
[3433.06 → 3434.72] Not well at all
[3434.72 → 3436.76] So I want to remember Was
[3436.76 → 3437.46] And Lena
[3437.46 → 3438.68] And the entire family
[3438.68 → 3440.26] CY and Greta
[3440.26 → 3442.20] You all know about CY
[3442.20 → 3443.50] He has cancer as well
[3443.50 → 3444.14] He's being treated
[3444.14 → 3447.22] I have an uncle in Holland
[3447.22 → 3450.06] His name is Hank Let ink
[3450.06 → 3451.90] He is probably one of the younger
[3451.90 → 3453.76] In-laws
[3453.76 → 3455.44] From all of my mom
[3455.44 → 3456.28] And her sisters
[3456.28 → 3458.66] And he is also in palliative care
[3458.66 → 3460.90] Been about a week or two now
[3460.90 → 3463.40] Leanne Harris' father
[3463.40 → 3465.24] Is in palliative care as well
[3465.24 → 3467.70] We also want to remember
[3467.70 → 3468.66] Eva Coleman
[3468.66 → 3470.94] And then we want to remember
[3470.94 → 3473.08] The people who are travelling right now
[3473.08 → 3474.88] One of the Wynn boys
[3474.88 → 3476.58] Is travelling with his team
[3476.58 → 3477.26] As is
[3477.26 → 3479.04] One of the Alabama boys
[3479.04 → 3481.04] And then we want to pray
[3481.04 → 3482.06] Especially for our students
[3482.06 → 3482.54] Who are
[3482.54 → 3484.44] Away and
[3484.44 → 3486.04] Travel back and forth
[3486.04 → 3486.62] All the time
[3486.62 → 3488.20] Let's pray
[3488.20 → 3491.34] Father in heaven
[3491.34 → 3492.12] Lord thank you
[3492.12 → 3494.96] Thank you that you are
[3494.96 → 3496.24] Here with us
[3496.24 → 3496.70] Where
[3496.70 → 3498.20] One or two are gathered
[3498.20 → 3499.58] You promise to be with us
[3499.58 → 3502.24] Thank you that we can do that
[3502.24 → 3503.16] Thank you that we can
[3503.16 → 3503.96] Be here
[3503.96 → 3506.08] Where we pray for the people
[3506.08 → 3506.70] Who can't
[3506.70 → 3508.16] Some of the ones
[3508.16 → 3509.24] That we mentioned already
[3509.24 → 3510.56] For various reasons
[3510.56 → 3510.92] Lord
[3510.92 → 3513.96] Whether it's in the hospital
[3513.96 → 3515.14] Or treatments
[3515.14 → 3515.76] Or
[3515.76 → 3518.26] Even things like colds
[3518.26 → 3519.42] With the kids at school
[3519.42 → 3519.82] Etc
[3519.82 → 3520.70] And they can't come
[3520.70 → 3521.58] Because of
[3521.58 → 3525.08] Spreading the stuff
[3525.08 → 3526.88] Lord we pray for
[3526.88 → 3527.92] All these people
[3527.92 → 3528.42] Who have
[3528.42 → 3530.26] Issues
[3530.26 → 3531.16] Whether it's
[3531.16 → 3533.42] End of life
[3533.42 → 3533.86] Or
[3533.86 → 3536.08] Things that
[3536.08 → 3537.36] You don't really expect
[3537.36 → 3541.20] Lord there are so many people
[3541.20 → 3542.10] With cancer
[3542.10 → 3543.10] What a
[3543.10 → 3545.84] Bad
[3545.84 → 3546.70] Word
[3546.70 → 3549.74] Lord we pray for each one of them
[3549.74 → 3550.50] That you will
[3550.50 → 3552.00] Be with them
[3552.00 → 3552.70] Will you touch them
[3552.70 → 3553.14] Will you
[3553.14 → 3554.14] Help them to realize
[3554.14 → 3555.76] That you are totally in control
[3555.76 → 3558.22] You allow stuff to happen
[3558.22 → 3558.52] That
[3558.52 → 3559.82] We don't understand why
[3559.82 → 3562.18] But also Lord
[3562.18 → 3563.22] You use that
[3563.22 → 3563.52] To
[3563.52 → 3564.70] Maybe wake us up
[3564.70 → 3566.40] Or maybe call us home
[3566.40 → 3568.02] And that's never easy
[3568.02 → 3570.40] Lord we pray for the people
[3570.40 → 3572.28] Who have gone
[3572.28 → 3575.06] To glory before us
[3575.06 → 3577.02] And we pray for those
[3577.02 → 3577.74] Empty seats
[3577.74 → 3580.10] And Lord we all know
[3580.10 → 3580.64] Some
[3580.64 → 3581.32] Or many
[3581.32 → 3583.80] Lord we pray for this church
[3583.80 → 3584.98] We thank you for this church
[3584.98 → 3586.12] We thank you for our staff
[3586.12 → 3588.86] We thank you for all the volunteers
[3588.86 → 3590.48] That do so much
[3590.48 → 3592.88] We pray Lord
[3592.88 → 3594.04] Will you be with the young ones
[3594.04 → 3594.52] As they
[3594.52 → 3595.36] Get taught
[3595.36 → 3596.26] Right now
[3596.26 → 3597.58] We pray
[3597.58 → 3598.44] Will you open their hearts
[3598.44 → 3599.04] And their minds
[3599.04 → 3599.66] And their ears
[3599.66 → 3601.78] Lord will you help us
[3601.78 → 3602.48] At home as well
[3602.48 → 3604.06] To teach the younger ones
[3604.06 → 3607.04] Where will you be with the teachers
[3607.04 → 3608.42] And the school kids
[3608.42 → 3611.06] Lord thank you that we can
[3611.06 → 3611.88] Look forward to Easter
[3611.88 → 3613.04] Thank you that we can
[3613.04 → 3614.50] So look forward to that
[3614.50 → 3615.90] When you came
[3615.90 → 3618.36] And think about what you
[3618.36 → 3619.38] Had to endure Lord
[3619.38 → 3621.84] And help us to be
[3621.84 → 3623.30] In the world
[3623.30 → 3624.84] But not of the world
[3624.84 → 3626.28] And help us to know
[3626.28 → 3626.88] The difference
[3626.88 → 3629.74] Lord thank you for your blessings
[3629.74 → 3631.04] Because we are so blessed
[3631.04 → 3631.50] To live
[3631.50 → 3632.72] Where we live
[3632.72 → 3633.72] And how we live
[3633.72 → 3635.84] Thank you that we can
[3635.84 → 3636.50] Study Romans
[3636.50 → 3637.30] Right now
[3637.30 → 3639.34] And we pray for Pastor Chris
[3639.34 → 3640.52] As he leads us through that
[3640.52 → 3642.50] Lord we pray
[3642.50 → 3643.70] Will you give us a good day
[3643.70 → 3644.26] Will you help us
[3644.26 → 3645.18] To think about others
[3645.18 → 3646.06] And not just ourselves
[3646.06 → 3646.90] Will you help us
[3646.90 → 3647.90] To pray for the others
[3647.90 → 3649.10] We all have people
[3649.10 → 3649.90] Lord in our lives
[3649.90 → 3652.92] That we could pray for
[3652.92 → 3656.24] Whether it's alone
[3656.24 → 3657.20] Or with them
[3657.20 → 3659.14] But especially for them
[3659.14 → 3660.98] Thank you for your love
[3660.98 → 3661.94] And your grace
[3661.94 → 3663.08] In Jesus name we pray
[3663.08 → 3663.50] Amen
[3667.30 → 3697.28] If you have
[3697.28 → 3698.36] A Bible with you
[3698.36 → 3699.50] I'm going to encourage you
[3699.50 → 3700.36] To open it up
[3700.36 → 3702.42] Like Dick said
[3702.42 → 3703.12] We're going to continue
[3703.12 → 3703.78] In our series
[3703.78 → 3704.56] In the book of Romans
[3704.56 → 3706.44] And we're going to read
[3706.44 → 3707.94] From Romans 3
[3707.94 → 3715.36] The first 20 verses there
[3715.36 → 3723.98] Before we do that
[3723.98 → 3731.20] One of the privileges
[3731.20 → 3733.00] Of being a pastor
[3733.00 → 3734.68] Is that I get to talk
[3734.68 → 3735.08] With people
[3735.08 → 3735.94] And I get to enter
[3735.94 → 3736.78] Into the lives
[3736.78 → 3737.54] And circumstances
[3737.54 → 3738.10] Of people
[3738.10 → 3739.68] And hear about
[3739.68 → 3740.60] What's going on
[3740.60 → 3741.62] And sometimes
[3741.62 → 3742.74] We get to share
[3742.74 → 3743.86] Hopes and dreams
[3743.86 → 3744.52] For life
[3744.52 → 3745.32] And for the world
[3745.32 → 3746.46] And sometimes
[3746.46 → 3747.58] We lament
[3747.58 → 3748.78] And cry together
[3748.78 → 3749.82] And enter into
[3749.82 → 3751.24] The dark night
[3751.24 → 3751.92] Of the soul
[3751.92 → 3754.46] And whether it's
[3754.46 → 3755.30] In joy
[3755.30 → 3757.16] Or in lament
[3757.16 → 3759.14] One of the cries
[3759.14 → 3761.50] Is often
[3761.50 → 3762.52] Is regularly
[3762.52 → 3764.46] For change
[3764.46 → 3765.86] Right?
[3765.94 → 3766.66] For something
[3766.66 → 3767.72] Different
[3767.72 → 3768.46] For either more
[3768.46 → 3769.26] Of this
[3769.26 → 3770.42] In spite of this
[3770.42 → 3771.58] Or for less
[3771.58 → 3772.28] Of that
[3772.28 → 3773.04] In the midst
[3773.04 → 3773.86] Of whatever pain
[3773.86 → 3774.74] Or heartache
[3774.74 → 3776.04] We are feeling
[3776.04 → 3776.88] The cry is
[3776.88 → 3777.76] For the world
[3777.76 → 3779.60] To change
[3779.60 → 3782.46] And you know
[3782.46 → 3783.92] From birth
[3783.92 → 3784.58] When I talk
[3784.58 → 3785.26] With parents
[3785.26 → 3785.86] And they go
[3785.86 → 3786.50] You know
[3786.50 → 3787.14] I just want
[3787.14 → 3788.20] God to use
[3788.20 → 3788.82] My child
[3788.82 → 3789.76] To change
[3789.76 → 3790.72] The world
[3790.72 → 3791.08] Or
[3791.08 → 3793.80] In the face
[3793.80 → 3795.66] Of breakdowns
[3795.66 → 3796.58] Of relationships
[3796.58 → 3797.46] Or death
[3797.46 → 3797.96] That we just
[3797.96 → 3799.02] Want the world
[3799.02 → 3799.72] To change
[3799.72 → 3800.58] Or in the
[3800.58 → 3801.68] Apparent
[3801.68 → 3802.52] Or seeming
[3802.52 → 3803.12] Decay
[3803.12 → 3804.04] Of society
[3804.04 → 3804.54] We just
[3804.54 → 3805.52] Want the world
[3805.52 → 3806.56] To change
[3806.56 → 3810.96] As we come
[3810.96 → 3812.28] To God's
[3812.28 → 3812.82] Word
[3812.82 → 3814.74] As we come
[3814.74 → 3815.18] From whatever
[3815.18 → 3816.28] Life circumstance
[3816.28 → 3817.26] You may be facing
[3817.26 → 3817.80] Rejoicing
[3817.80 → 3818.32] Or mourning
[3818.32 → 3818.92] And the like
[3818.92 → 3819.82] As we come
[3819.82 → 3820.68] Crying out
[3820.68 → 3822.28] For change
[3822.28 → 3823.62] And transformation
[3823.62 → 3825.32] Come
[3825.32 → 3827.14] And hear
[3827.14 → 3827.56] What God
[3827.56 → 3828.30] Has to say
[3828.30 → 3829.90] And maybe
[3829.90 → 3831.40] We'll be surprised
[3831.40 → 3832.20] At how that
[3832.20 → 3832.92] Change
[3832.92 → 3833.94] Can actually
[3833.94 → 3835.04] Happen
[3835.04 → 3837.26] Let's read
[3837.26 → 3838.20] Romans 3
[3838.20 → 3840.04] Together
[3840.04 → 3845.38] Paul writes
[3845.38 → 3847.62] What advantage
[3847.62 → 3848.98] Then is there
[3848.98 → 3850.18] In being a Jew
[3850.18 → 3851.46] Or what value
[3851.46 → 3852.10] Is there
[3852.10 → 3853.18] In circumcision
[3853.18 → 3854.64] Much
[3854.64 → 3855.74] In every way
[3855.74 → 3857.42] First
[3857.42 → 3857.98] The Jews
[3857.98 → 3858.96] Have been entrusted
[3858.96 → 3859.56] With the very
[3859.56 → 3860.66] Words of God
[3860.66 → 3863.40] What if
[3863.40 → 3863.92] Some are
[3863.92 → 3864.52] Unfaithful
[3864.52 → 3866.06] Will their
[3866.06 → 3866.78] Unfaithfulness
[3866.78 → 3867.32] Nullify
[3867.32 → 3867.78] God's
[3867.78 → 3868.20] Faithfulness
[3868.20 → 3870.34] Not at all
[3870.34 → 3871.16] Let God
[3871.16 → 3871.60] Be true
[3871.60 → 3872.14] And every
[3872.14 → 3872.70] Human being
[3872.70 → 3873.18] A liar
[3873.18 → 3874.00] As it
[3874.00 → 3874.46] Is written
[3874.46 → 3877.56] So that
[3877.56 → 3877.98] You may
[3877.98 → 3878.50] Be proved
[3878.50 → 3878.90] Right
[3878.90 → 3879.34] When you
[3879.34 → 3879.70] Speak
[3879.70 → 3880.42] And prevail
[3880.42 → 3880.96] When you
[3880.96 → 3881.38] Judge
[3881.38 → 3883.06] But if
[3883.06 → 3883.38] Our
[3883.38 → 3884.42] Unrighteousness
[3884.42 → 3885.12] Brings out
[3885.12 → 3885.84] God's
[3885.84 → 3886.50] Righteousness
[3886.50 → 3887.18] More clearly
[3887.18 → 3887.98] What shall
[3887.98 → 3888.46] We say
[3888.46 → 3889.56] That God
[3889.56 → 3890.26] Is unjust
[3890.26 → 3890.76] In bringing
[3890.76 → 3891.38] His wrath
[3891.38 → 3891.94] On us
[3891.94 → 3892.84] I'm using
[3892.84 → 3893.24] A human
[3893.24 → 3893.76] Argument
[3893.76 → 3894.76] Certainly
[3894.76 → 3895.16] Not
[3895.16 → 3896.18] If that
[3896.18 → 3896.58] Were so
[3896.58 → 3897.16] How could
[3897.16 → 3897.72] God judge
[3897.72 → 3898.20] The world
[3898.20 → 3899.68] Someone might
[3899.68 → 3900.02] Argue
[3900.02 → 3900.48] If my
[3900.48 → 3900.98] Falsehood
[3900.98 → 3901.58] Enhances
[3901.58 → 3902.06] God's
[3902.06 → 3902.76] Truthfulness
[3902.76 → 3903.58] And so
[3903.58 → 3904.18] Increases
[3904.18 → 3904.88] His glory
[3904.88 → 3905.76] Why am
[3905.76 → 3906.24] I still
[3906.24 → 3906.84] Condemned
[3906.84 → 3907.22] As a
[3907.22 → 3907.52] Sinner
[3907.52 → 3908.94] Why not
[3908.94 → 3909.34] Say
[3909.34 → 3910.22] As some
[3910.22 → 3911.00] Slanderously
[3911.00 → 3911.44] Claim
[3911.44 → 3911.86] That we
[3911.86 → 3912.22] Say
[3912.22 → 3913.04] Let us
[3913.04 → 3913.58] Do evil
[3913.58 → 3914.08] That good
[3914.08 → 3914.76] May result
[3914.76 → 3916.12] Their
[3916.12 → 3917.02] Condemnation
[3917.02 → 3917.94] Is just
[3917.94 → 3920.38] What shall
[3920.38 → 3921.16] We conclude
[3921.16 → 3921.54] Then
[3921.54 → 3922.96] Do we
[3922.96 → 3923.48] Have any
[3923.48 → 3924.12] Advantage
[3924.12 → 3925.32] Not at
[3925.32 → 3925.58] All
[3925.58 → 3926.78] For we
[3926.78 → 3927.48] Have already
[3927.48 → 3927.92] Made the
[3927.92 → 3928.26] Charge
[3928.26 → 3928.74] That Jews
[3928.74 → 3929.36] And Gentiles
[3929.36 → 3929.76] Alike
[3929.76 → 3930.26] Are all
[3930.26 → 3930.74] Under the
[3930.74 → 3931.02] Power
[3931.02 → 3931.52] Of sin
[3931.52 → 3932.70] As it
[3932.70 → 3933.10] Is written
[3933.10 → 3934.84] There is
[3934.84 → 3935.54] No one
[3935.54 → 3936.36] Righteous
[3936.36 → 3937.18] Not even
[3937.18 → 3937.74] One
[3937.74 → 3938.12] There is
[3938.12 → 3938.64] No one
[3938.64 → 3939.50] Who understands
[3939.50 → 3940.34] There is
[3940.34 → 3940.96] No one
[3940.96 → 3941.46] Who seeks
[3941.46 → 3941.86] God
[3941.86 → 3942.76] All have
[3942.76 → 3943.14] Turned
[3943.14 → 3943.52] Away
[3943.52 → 3944.14] They have
[3944.14 → 3944.50] Together
[3944.50 → 3944.94] Become
[3944.94 → 3945.52] Worthless
[3945.52 → 3945.94] There is
[3945.94 → 3946.60] No one
[3946.60 → 3947.20] Who does
[3947.20 → 3947.60] Good
[3947.60 → 3948.84] Not even
[3948.84 → 3949.64] One
[3949.64 → 3950.92] Their
[3950.92 → 3951.42] Throats
[3951.42 → 3952.04] Are open
[3952.04 → 3952.60] Graves
[3952.60 → 3953.14] Their tongues
[3953.14 → 3954.14] Practice deceit
[3954.14 → 3954.96] The poison
[3954.96 → 3955.56] Of vipers
[3955.56 → 3956.08] Is on their
[3956.08 → 3956.34] Lips
[3956.34 → 3957.02] Their mouths
[3957.02 → 3957.54] Are full
[3957.54 → 3958.24] Of cursing
[3958.24 → 3958.98] And bitterness
[3958.98 → 3959.88] Their feet
[3959.88 → 3960.50] Are swift
[3960.50 → 3961.04] To shed
[3961.04 → 3961.46] Blood
[3961.46 → 3962.22] Ruin
[3962.22 → 3962.90] And misery
[3962.90 → 3963.52] Mark their
[3963.52 → 3963.92] Ways
[3963.92 → 3964.22] And the
[3964.22 → 3964.48] Way
[3964.48 → 3965.10] Of peace
[3965.10 → 3965.54] They do
[3965.54 → 3966.02] Not know
[3966.02 → 3966.82] There is
[3966.82 → 3967.58] No fear
[3967.58 → 3968.26] Of God
[3968.26 → 3969.36] Before their
[3969.36 → 3969.76] Eyes
[3969.76 → 3972.38] Now we know
[3972.38 → 3973.40] That whatever the law
[3973.40 → 3975.04] Says it says to those
[3975.04 → 3976.02] Who are under the law
[3976.02 → 3977.26] So that every mouth
[3977.26 → 3978.24] May be silenced
[3978.24 → 3979.58] And the whole world
[3979.58 → 3980.60] Held accountable
[3980.60 → 3981.52] To God
[3981.52 → 3983.32] Therefore
[3983.32 → 3984.38] No one will be
[3984.38 → 3985.12] Declared righteous
[3985.12 → 3986.18] In God's sight
[3986.18 → 3986.90] By the works
[3986.90 → 3987.52] Of the law
[3987.52 → 3988.16] Rather
[3988.16 → 3989.30] Through the law
[3989.30 → 3989.86] We become
[3989.86 → 3990.52] Conscious
[3990.52 → 3992.08] Of our
[3992.08 → 3992.94] Sin
[3992.94 → 3995.12] This is the word
[3995.12 → 3995.54] Of the Lord
[3995.54 → 4004.16] We've been in the book
[4004.16 → 4004.70] Of Romans
[4004.70 → 4007.16] For about
[4007.16 → 4008.22] Six or seven weeks
[4008.22 → 4008.90] Now
[4008.90 → 4011.16] And I just want to say
[4011.16 → 4012.44] And say thank you
[4012.44 → 4013.26] Because I've been really
[4013.26 → 4014.46] Encouraged by
[4014.46 → 4016.28] Your engagements
[4016.28 → 4017.72] And by your feedback
[4017.72 → 4018.78] By your willingness
[4018.78 → 4020.26] To dig deep
[4020.26 → 4021.22] Into the scriptures
[4021.22 → 4021.86] Of God
[4021.86 → 4022.86] And the emails
[4022.86 → 4023.34] I get
[4023.34 → 4024.12] And the conversations
[4024.12 → 4024.76] That I have
[4024.76 → 4026.44] Have been good
[4026.44 → 4027.34] And encouraging
[4027.34 → 4027.78] For me
[4027.78 → 4029.02] And so thank you
[4029.02 → 4029.70] For that
[4029.70 → 4031.64] But I also know
[4031.64 → 4032.34] That it hasn't
[4032.34 → 4033.52] Always been easy
[4033.52 → 4034.38] Right
[4034.38 → 4035.52] That some of this
[4035.52 → 4036.86] Stuff
[4036.86 → 4037.48] And these texts
[4037.48 → 4038.18] Have been hard
[4038.18 → 4039.58] Both intellectually
[4039.58 → 4040.80] To understand
[4040.80 → 4042.36] But also emotionally
[4042.36 → 4043.72] To reflect on
[4043.72 → 4044.16] Right
[4044.16 → 4044.98] And to live
[4044.98 → 4045.82] In the midst of
[4045.82 → 4048.60] Now in a
[4048.60 → 4049.98] Piece of scripture
[4049.98 → 4050.92] That is really
[4050.92 → 4051.94] Encouraging to me
[4051.94 → 4053.16] Or encouraging
[4053.16 → 4054.00] To my mind
[4054.00 → 4056.16] In second Peter
[4056.16 → 4057.50] Peter writes
[4057.50 → 4058.88] This
[4058.88 → 4059.56] Of Paul
[4059.56 → 4059.96] He says
[4059.96 → 4060.26] He
[4060.26 → 4060.82] Paul
[4060.82 → 4062.38] Writes the same way
[4062.38 → 4063.28] In all his letters
[4063.28 → 4065.20] Speaking in them
[4065.20 → 4066.50] Of these matters
[4066.50 → 4067.26] His letters
[4067.26 → 4068.50] Contain some things
[4068.50 → 4069.16] That are hard
[4069.16 → 4070.08] To understand
[4070.08 → 4071.14] Which ignorant
[4071.14 → 4072.16] And unstable people
[4072.16 → 4072.62] Distort
[4072.62 → 4073.42] As they do
[4073.42 → 4074.06] Other scriptures
[4074.06 → 4075.14] To their own
[4075.14 → 4075.98] Destruction
[4075.98 → 4079.02] So even Peter
[4079.02 → 4079.92] Right
[4079.92 → 4080.94] Who's an author
[4080.94 → 4081.64] Of scripture
[4081.64 → 4083.02] Right
[4083.02 → 4083.94] The disciple
[4083.94 → 4084.72] On whom
[4084.72 → 4085.64] Jesus will build
[4085.64 → 4086.10] His church
[4086.10 → 4086.70] The rock
[4086.70 → 4087.24] On whom
[4087.24 → 4088.04] That Jesus
[4088.04 → 4088.34] Will build
[4088.34 → 4088.60] His church
[4088.60 → 4089.16] And the gates
[4089.16 → 4089.56] Of hell
[4089.56 → 4090.28] Will not overcome
[4090.28 → 4090.58] It
[4090.58 → 4091.06] Right
[4091.06 → 4091.94] Even Peter
[4091.94 → 4092.90] Goes
[4092.90 → 4093.26] Yeah
[4093.26 → 4095.30] Paul's pretty hard
[4095.30 → 4097.72] Some of this
[4097.72 → 4099.06] Is pretty tough
[4099.06 → 4100.90] And so if you've
[4100.90 → 4101.58] Been challenged
[4101.58 → 4102.36] By this
[4102.36 → 4104.38] You're in good
[4104.38 → 4104.80] Company
[4104.80 → 4106.48] Right
[4106.48 → 4107.38] And thank you
[4107.38 → 4108.08] For digging in
[4108.08 → 4108.78] And for following
[4108.78 → 4109.16] Along
[4109.16 → 4112.18] Now I bring that
[4112.18 → 4112.60] Up
[4112.60 → 4113.36] Specifically
[4113.36 → 4114.26] This morning
[4114.26 → 4115.94] Because I think
[4115.94 → 4117.02] This section
[4117.02 → 4117.50] Of scripture
[4117.50 → 4118.36] Might be one of
[4118.36 → 4119.30] Those particularly
[4119.30 → 4120.28] Hard
[4120.28 → 4121.38] Instances
[4121.38 → 4122.16] Of Paul's
[4122.16 → 4122.52] Writing
[4122.52 → 4123.14] One of those
[4123.14 → 4124.44] Hard passages
[4124.44 → 4125.02] Of Paul
[4125.02 → 4125.90] To understand
[4125.90 → 4126.44] In part
[4126.44 → 4127.12] Because of the
[4127.12 → 4127.70] Structure
[4127.70 → 4128.26] Right
[4128.26 → 4128.80] In the way
[4128.80 → 4129.44] That he asks
[4129.44 → 4130.24] These questions
[4130.24 → 4131.18] Back and forth
[4131.18 → 4132.62] But also
[4132.62 → 4133.66] And maybe you
[4133.66 → 4134.02] Heard it
[4134.02 → 4134.72] When we read it
[4134.72 → 4135.60] Also because
[4135.60 → 4136.74] It seems in there
[4136.74 → 4138.30] To be a contradiction
[4138.30 → 4140.00] Right
[4140.00 → 4140.64] Did you see it
[4140.64 → 4141.46] When we first
[4141.46 → 4141.94] Read it
[4141.94 → 4142.18] Right
[4142.18 → 4143.86] Look at verse
[4143.86 → 4144.56] One and verse
[4144.56 → 4144.92] Two
[4144.92 → 4146.08] Right
[4146.08 → 4147.28] Paul asks
[4147.28 → 4148.18] What advantages
[4148.18 → 4149.30] Are there to being
[4149.30 → 4149.70] A Jew
[4149.70 → 4150.02] Right
[4150.02 → 4150.60] What advantages
[4150.60 → 4151.18] Are there to being
[4151.18 → 4152.02] Circumcised
[4152.02 → 4152.56] And he says
[4152.56 → 4153.02] Much
[4153.02 → 4154.04] In every way
[4154.04 → 4155.52] And then he goes
[4155.52 → 4155.88] On to say
[4155.88 → 4156.56] That the advantage
[4156.56 → 4157.16] Is that
[4157.16 → 4158.06] The Jews
[4158.06 → 4158.74] Have the word
[4158.74 → 4159.22] Of God
[4159.22 → 4160.64] But then
[4160.64 → 4161.14] In verse
[4161.14 → 4161.58] Nine
[4161.58 → 4162.46] He says
[4162.46 → 4163.70] So what
[4163.70 → 4164.56] What can we
[4164.56 → 4165.00] Conclude
[4165.00 → 4165.64] Do we have
[4165.64 → 4166.56] Any advantage
[4166.56 → 4168.44] Not at all
[4168.44 → 4170.90] Now wait a minute
[4170.90 → 4171.64] Didn't you just say
[4171.64 → 4172.58] There was much
[4172.58 → 4173.52] And now you're
[4173.52 → 4173.90] Saying there's
[4173.90 → 4174.38] Not at all
[4174.38 → 4175.80] There's this
[4175.80 → 4176.36] Apparent
[4176.36 → 4177.20] Contradiction
[4177.20 → 4178.70] And so which is it
[4178.70 → 4179.14] Are the Jews
[4179.14 → 4179.88] Better off
[4179.88 → 4181.50] Or are they not
[4181.50 → 4182.22] Or
[4182.22 → 4183.52] Is there a way
[4183.52 → 4184.38] To understand
[4184.38 → 4185.18] This
[4185.18 → 4186.16] That doesn't
[4186.16 → 4186.60] Make it
[4186.60 → 4187.68] A contradiction
[4187.68 → 4189.04] Now
[4189.04 → 4189.96] I mean if you
[4189.96 → 4190.34] Know me
[4190.34 → 4191.08] It won't surprise
[4191.08 → 4191.42] You to know
[4191.42 → 4191.82] That I think
[4191.82 → 4192.38] It's the latter
[4192.38 → 4193.12] Right
[4193.12 → 4193.82] That there is a way
[4193.82 → 4194.84] To understand
[4194.84 → 4195.42] All of this
[4195.42 → 4195.76] Together
[4195.76 → 4196.50] And we'll get
[4196.50 → 4196.76] There
[4196.76 → 4197.98] But I want
[4197.98 → 4198.68] To start
[4198.68 → 4200.02] By naming
[4200.02 → 4201.08] And digging
[4201.08 → 4202.30] Into this
[4202.30 → 4203.02] Apparent
[4203.02 → 4204.12] Contradiction
[4204.12 → 4205.32] And we'll
[4205.32 → 4206.04] Do the work
[4206.04 → 4206.96] Then of wrestling
[4206.96 → 4208.10] With the questions
[4208.10 → 4208.76] That Paul
[4208.76 → 4210.36] Asks and raises
[4210.36 → 4214.12] Now in the
[4214.12 → 4214.88] Structure of
[4214.88 → 4216.28] Romans chapter
[4216.28 → 4216.66] Three
[4216.66 → 4218.58] The beginning
[4218.58 → 4219.70] Part here
[4219.70 → 4221.00] Is for us
[4221.00 → 4221.70] An example
[4221.70 → 4222.62] Of Paul
[4222.62 → 4223.58] Being a
[4223.58 → 4224.74] Perfect
[4224.74 → 4225.80] Teacher
[4225.80 → 4227.38] And as a
[4227.38 → 4227.96] Perfect
[4227.96 → 4228.36] Teacher
[4228.36 → 4228.92] And I'm looking
[4228.92 → 4229.50] At some of you
[4229.50 → 4229.86] Right now
[4229.86 → 4230.68] Who are teachers
[4230.68 → 4231.26] Right
[4231.26 → 4231.90] You know this
[4231.90 → 4232.58] As a really
[4232.58 → 4233.58] Good teacher
[4233.58 → 4235.06] Paul is able
[4235.06 → 4236.18] To anticipate
[4236.18 → 4237.26] The kinds
[4237.26 → 4238.16] Of questions
[4238.16 → 4238.92] That his
[4238.92 → 4239.48] Hearers
[4239.48 → 4240.02] Will ask
[4240.02 → 4240.40] Of him
[4240.40 → 4241.72] Right
[4241.72 → 4242.40] A good teacher
[4242.40 → 4243.10] Knows
[4243.10 → 4244.04] What you might
[4244.04 → 4244.86] Wonder about
[4244.86 → 4245.42] As he
[4245.42 → 4246.02] Or she
[4246.02 → 4246.64] Speaks
[4246.64 → 4247.28] And then be able
[4247.28 → 4248.14] To address
[4248.14 → 4249.08] That in anticipation
[4249.08 → 4250.32] Of what you say
[4250.32 → 4252.02] And so for an
[4252.02 → 4252.60] Example
[4252.60 → 4255.30] An experienced
[4255.30 → 4256.28] Math teacher
[4256.28 → 4258.06] Will be able
[4258.06 → 4258.70] To figure out
[4258.70 → 4259.28] Or can probably
[4259.28 → 4259.78] Guess
[4259.78 → 4261.26] What kinds
[4261.26 → 4261.98] Of questions
[4261.98 → 4262.98] Her grade nine
[4262.98 → 4264.16] Students will ask
[4264.16 → 4265.74] When she introduces
[4265.74 → 4266.86] The slope
[4266.86 → 4267.50] Intercept
[4267.50 → 4267.98] Formula
[4267.98 → 4269.06] Right
[4269.06 → 4269.72] Of y
[4269.72 → 4270.16] Equals
[4270.16 → 4270.56] MX
[4270.56 → 4271.06] Plus b
[4271.06 → 4272.92] Now how many
[4272.92 → 4273.36] Of you remember
[4273.36 → 4273.64] That
[4273.64 → 4276.26] We got one
[4276.26 → 4276.90] Excellent
[4276.90 → 4278.90] So not Rob
[4278.90 → 4279.94] But maybe
[4279.94 → 4280.58] A grade nine
[4280.58 → 4281.00] Student
[4281.00 → 4282.14] Right
[4282.14 → 4282.72] What is m
[4282.72 → 4283.18] Equal
[4283.18 → 4287.04] Mass
[4287.04 → 4287.70] Oh wrong
[4287.70 → 4288.24] Equation
[4288.24 → 4290.12] The slope
[4290.12 → 4290.62] Of the line
[4290.62 → 4292.10] Right
[4292.10 → 4292.54] What is
[4292.54 → 4293.86] B
[4293.86 → 4294.42] Equal
[4294.42 → 4297.52] The y
[4297.52 → 4298.00] Intercept
[4298.00 → 4298.50] Of the line
[4298.50 → 4299.02] Or the value
[4299.02 → 4299.46] Of y
[4299.46 → 4299.94] And x
[4299.94 → 4301.04] When it
[4301.04 → 4301.48] Is zero
[4301.48 → 4302.20] Or value
[4302.20 → 4302.48] Of y
[4302.48 → 4302.88] When x
[4302.88 → 4303.24] Is zero
[4303.24 → 4304.02] Now I had
[4304.02 → 4304.26] To look
[4304.26 → 4304.62] That up
[4304.62 → 4305.90] So I had
[4305.90 → 4306.50] Bad teachers
[4306.50 → 4308.22] It's their fault
[4308.22 → 4308.66] See what I did
[4308.66 → 4308.82] There
[4308.82 → 4309.20] Nice
[4309.20 → 4311.36] But
[4311.36 → 4311.98] So the
[4311.98 → 4312.98] Kids might
[4312.98 → 4313.38] Ask those
[4313.38 → 4314.02] Kinds of questions
[4314.02 → 4314.66] But also
[4314.66 → 4315.12] The more
[4315.12 → 4315.50] Difficult
[4315.50 → 4315.90] Questions
[4315.90 → 4316.44] Like why
[4316.44 → 4316.82] On earth
[4316.82 → 4317.12] Does it
[4317.12 → 4317.32] Matter
[4317.32 → 4317.60] If I
[4317.60 → 4317.74] Know
[4317.74 → 4318.10] That y
[4318.10 → 4318.38] Equals
[4318.38 → 4318.68] MX
[4318.68 → 4319.10] Plus b
[4319.10 → 4321.48] And what's
[4321.48 → 4321.80] The real
[4321.80 → 4322.54] World application
[4322.54 → 4322.96] Of that
[4322.96 → 4324.90] And a good
[4324.90 → 4325.20] Teacher
[4325.20 → 4325.66] Can answer
[4325.66 → 4325.98] That
[4325.98 → 4328.96] Right
[4328.96 → 4329.20] A good
[4329.20 → 4329.56] Teacher
[4329.56 → 4330.10] Has
[4330.10 → 4331.28] Probably
[4331.28 → 4331.82] Had this
[4331.82 → 4332.22] Kind of
[4332.22 → 4332.84] Conversation
[4332.84 → 4333.30] Before
[4333.30 → 4334.12] And knows
[4334.12 → 4334.32] What's
[4334.32 → 4334.60] Coming
[4334.60 → 4335.82] Likewise
[4335.82 → 4336.28] Here's
[4336.28 → 4336.70] Another
[4336.70 → 4337.32] Example
[4337.32 → 4337.96] Right
[4337.96 → 4339.10] A grade
[4339.10 → 4339.60] 12
[4339.60 → 4340.18] AP
[4340.18 → 4341.12] English
[4341.12 → 4341.46] Lit
[4341.46 → 4341.94] Teacher
[4341.94 → 4342.84] Knows
[4342.84 → 4343.38] The sorts
[4343.38 → 4343.54] Of
[4343.54 → 4344.08] Questions
[4344.08 → 4345.20] That he
[4345.20 → 4345.52] Will get
[4345.52 → 4345.82] From his
[4345.82 → 4346.12] Students
[4346.12 → 4346.86] When he
[4346.86 → 4347.30] Asks
[4347.30 → 4347.72] About
[4347.72 → 4348.02] Mary
[4348.02 → 4348.54] Shelley's
[4348.54 → 4349.44] Frankenstein
[4349.44 → 4350.70] Now I
[4350.70 → 4350.98] Did my
[4350.98 → 4351.42] Research
[4351.42 → 4352.68] Mary
[4352.68 → 4353.08] Shelley's
[4353.08 → 4353.50] Frankenstein
[4353.50 → 4353.86] Is a
[4353.86 → 4354.04] Book
[4354.04 → 4354.38] That you

[4358.48 → 4358.78] Question
[4358.78 → 4358.96] Is

[4749.70 → 4750.06] Okay
[4750.06 → 4750.48] Sure
[4750.48 → 4750.88] Paul
[4750.88 → 4751.28] You've
[4751.28 → 4751.44] Been
[4751.44 → 4751.78] Saying

[4758.48 → 4759.36] God's
[4759.36 → 4760.12] Faithfulness
[4760.12 → 4761.88] Of

[4762.12 → 4762.48] Not
[4762.48 → 4763.08] Says
[4763.08 → 4763.40] Paul
[4763.40 → 4764.54] Right
[4764.54 → 4766.36] Another

[4766.68 → 4766.84] This
[4766.84 → 4767.08] Idea
[4767.08 → 4767.18] Is
[4767.18 → 4767.30] That
[4767.30 → 4767.70] We
[4767.70 → 4767.90] Are
[4767.90 → 4768.40] Created

[4771.36 → 4772.54] And
[4772.54 → 4772.94] So
[4772.94 → 4773.52] Because
[4773.52 → 4774.02] We
[4774.02 → 4774.30] Might
[4774.30 → 4774.54] Be

[4781.14 → 4781.52] Is
[4781.52 → 4781.74] True
[4781.74 → 4783.00] Right
[4783.00 → 4783.22] God
[4783.22 → 4783.74] Cannot
[4783.74 → 4783.96] Be
[4783.96 → 4784.54] Unfaithful

[4789.22 → 4789.52] God
[4789.52 → 4789.72] To
[4789.72 → 4789.90] Be
[4789.90 → 4790.24] God
[4790.24 → 4790.48] He
[4790.48 → 4790.76] Must
[4790.76 → 4791.20] Always
[4791.20 → 4791.78] Be
[4791.78 → 4792.82] Faithful
[4792.82 → 4793.82] God
[4793.82 → 4794.22] You
[4794.22 → 4794.32] You've
[4794.32 → 4794.34] You've

[4810.00 → 4811.80] Right
[4811.80 → 4812.18] God's
[4812.18 → 4812.94] Faithfulness
[4812.94 → 4813.58] Depends
[4813.58 → 4813.78] On

[4831.24 → 4831.46] There's

[4849.78 → 4849.86] The
[4849.86 → 4850.06] Next
[4850.06 → 4850.48] Question
[4850.48 → 4851.22] That
[4851.22 → 4851.46] Paul
[4851.46 → 4852.72] Anticipates
[4852.72 → 4854.44] I
[4854.44 → 4855.46] Think
[4855.46 → 4856.20] Is
[4856.20 → 4857.16] Brilliant
[4857.16 → 4858.92] He's
[4858.92 → 4859.18] Just
[4859.18 → 4859.62] Finished
[4859.62 → 4860.06] Saying
[4860.06 → 4860.36] That
[4860.36 → 4861.10] Our
[4861.10 → 4861.92] Unfaithfulness
[4861.92 → 4862.52] Doesn't
[4862.52 → 4862.94] Affect
[4862.94 → 4863.80] God's
[4863.80 → 4864.48] Faithfulness
[4864.48 → 4865.16] And
[4865.16 → 4865.50] So
[4865.50 → 4866.24] The
[4866.24 → 4866.56] People
[4866.56 → 4867.38] Will
[4867.38 → 4867.76] Wonder
[4867.76 → 4868.10] They'll
[4868.10 → 4868.40] Begin
[4868.40 → 4868.56] To
[4868.56 → 4868.86] Ask
[4868.86 → 4869.10] Well
[4869.10 → 4869.62] If
[4869.62 → 4869.96] Our
[4869.96 → 4871.14] Unrighteousness
[4871.14 → 4871.56] Brings
[4871.56 → 4871.86] Out
[4871.86 → 4872.32] God's
[4872.32 → 4873.24] Righteousness
[4873.24 → 4873.56] More
[4873.56 → 4874.14] Clearly
[4874.14 → 4875.24] Shouldn't
[4875.24 → 4875.40] We

[4876.16 → 4876.68] Sinning
[4876.68 → 4876.90] So
[4876.90 → 4877.10] That
[4877.10 → 4878.18] God
[4878.18 → 4878.58] Is
[4878.58 → 4879.02] More
[4879.02 → 4879.86] Glorious
[4879.86 → 4881.22] Right
[4881.22 → 4881.46] Shouldn't

[4882.66 → 4883.20] Sinning
[4883.20 → 4883.40] So
[4883.40 → 4883.58] That
[4883.58 → 4884.24] God's
[4884.24 → 4884.96] Righteousness
[4884.96 → 4885.16] Can
[4885.16 → 4885.32] Be
[4885.32 → 4885.58] Even
[4885.58 → 4886.14] More
[4886.14 → 4887.12] Magnificent
[4887.12 → 4887.24] And
[4887.24 → 4887.38] Even

[4890.62 → 4891.06] Seven
[4891.06 → 4891.22] If

[4894.08 → 4894.36] My
[4894.36 → 4895.08] Falsehood
[4895.08 → 4895.72] Enhances
[4895.72 → 4896.24] God's
[4896.24 → 4896.86] Truthfulness
[4896.86 → 4897.34] And
[4897.34 → 4897.62] So
[4897.62 → 4898.28] Increases
[4898.28 → 4898.56] His
[4898.56 → 4899.00] Glory
[4899.00 → 4899.76] Why
