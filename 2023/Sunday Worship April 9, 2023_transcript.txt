[0.00 --> 6.72]  And He shed His blood to set us free
[6.72 --> 12.48]  As the nails waiting in the sky were dark
[12.48 --> 18.90]  The redemption of the world was on His heart
[18.90 --> 24.18]  Friday's good, good Sunday is coming
[24.18 --> 30.36]  Don't lose hope, good Sunday is coming
[30.36 --> 36.34]  Devil, you're done, you better start running
[36.34 --> 42.38]  Friday's good, good Sunday is coming
[42.38 --> 54.42]  Then He breathed His last and bowed His head
[54.42 --> 60.36]  The Son of God and men were dead
[60.36 --> 66.68]  With bloody hands, tears on their face
[66.68 --> 72.78]  They laid Him down inside that grave
[72.78 --> 75.82]  But that wasn't the end
[75.82 --> 78.92]  That wasn't the end
[78.92 --> 81.40]  That wasn't the end
[81.40 --> 84.38]  Let me tell you what happened next
[84.38 --> 90.40]  The women came before the dawn
[90.40 --> 96.24]  To find that stone already gone
[96.24 --> 100.44]  When they looked inside
[100.44 --> 102.44]  The angels said
[102.44 --> 107.98]  Why are you looking for the living among the dead?
[108.04 --> 110.50]  He's alive, He's alive
[110.50 --> 113.50]  Hallelujah, He's alive
[113.50 --> 116.54]  Give Him praise, lift Him high
[116.54 --> 119.50]  Hallelujah, He's alive
[119.50 --> 122.52]  He's alive, He's alive
[122.52 --> 125.50]  Hallelujah, He's alive
[125.50 --> 128.52]  Give Him praise, lift Him high
[128.52 --> 132.26]  Hallelujah, He's alive
[132.26 --> 138.04]  Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[138.04 --> 144.10]  Don't lose hope, good Sunday is coming
[144.10 --> 150.10]  Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[150.10 --> 154.10]  Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[154.12 --> 162.32]  Now Jesus reigns upon the throne
[162.32 --> 168.26]  Our heaven sings to Him alone
[168.26 --> 171.28]  We watch and wait
[171.28 --> 174.26]  Like a bride for a groom
[174.26 --> 177.26]  Oh, church arise
[177.26 --> 180.26]  He's coming soon
[180.26 --> 181.08]  Yes, He's coming soon
[181.08 --> 181.60]  After the death ends
[181.60 --> 186.24]  Amen
[186.26 --> 190.26]  Hopefully, he may have a room
[190.26 --> 192.26]  Although, at the time of his death

[614.42 --> 615.84]  Good morning.
[617.84 --> 619.44]  Christ is risen.
[620.06 --> 621.38]  He is risen indeed.
[621.72 --> 622.98]  Oh, good practice, Ron.
[623.02 --> 625.02]  We're going to do that again in just a moment, so be ready.
[625.90 --> 628.04]  Welcome to worship.
[628.04 --> 628.94]  My name is Chris.
[629.14 --> 639.92]  I'm one of the pastors here at Emanuel, and it is my privilege and pleasure to welcome you into worship together this morning.
[640.40 --> 645.64]  This is one of my, perhaps even my absolute favorite Sunday of the year.
[645.74 --> 648.20]  I love Resurrection Sunday.
[648.20 --> 651.52]  I love the power of Jesus on full display.
[651.72 --> 657.92]  I love the chance for the church to sing with boldness and clarity the truth of the gospel.
[658.44 --> 661.34]  I love that we get to spend that time together.
[662.04 --> 672.96]  As we worship this morning, we come to the table to taste and see the goodness of God, and we will participate together in the baptism of Gus, which we're really excited about.
[672.96 --> 681.56]  And so if you are visiting with us this morning and would like to hear more about us, there's a card in your seats that says Connect.
[682.08 --> 683.52]  There's a QR code on it.
[683.58 --> 689.68]  You can fill the card out and put it in the bags when they come around, or you can scan the QR code and do it that way.
[690.04 --> 692.52]  That QR code is also variously throughout the building.
[692.86 --> 695.96]  We'd love to hear from you and connect with you.
[696.54 --> 701.64]  As we gather for worship, we gather in the presence of our God.
[701.64 --> 703.42]  We're going to sing and we're going to pray.
[703.58 --> 705.38]  We're going to praise and we're going to hear.
[705.56 --> 713.06]  And so I'm going to invite you, as you are able to stand, that we might come into God's presence together.
[716.52 --> 720.36]  We're going to begin with our Easter anthem.
[721.02 --> 722.76]  Christ is risen.
[722.76 --> 725.12]  He is risen indeed.
[725.44 --> 727.32]  Christ is risen.
[727.98 --> 728.70]  Hallelujah.
[729.46 --> 730.94]  He is risen indeed.
[730.94 --> 733.24]  Amen and amen.
[733.40 --> 735.94]  Receive the greeting of our God.
[737.30 --> 746.98]  Grace and peace to you from him who is and who was, from him who is to come, and from the seven spirits before his throne,
[746.98 --> 754.40]  and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, the ruler and the kings of the earth.
[755.28 --> 755.92]  Amen.
[755.92 --> 756.00]  Amen.
[756.80 --> 762.00]  I'm going to invite you to turn to those around you and welcome them on this Easter Sunday into worship.

[1565.70 --> 1572.72]  My peace transfers on Jesus' face.
[1587.80 --> 1617.78]  The blazing sun shall pierce the light.
[1617.80 --> 1633.80]  The blazing sun shall pierce the light.
[1633.80 --> 1646.80]  O praise the name of the Lord our God, O praise His name forevermore.
[1646.80 --> 1659.80]  For endless days we will sing your praise, O Lord, O Lord our God.
[1659.80 --> 1661.80]  O praise His name forevermore.
[1661.80 --> 1674.80]  O praise His name forevermore.
[1674.80 --> 1676.80]  O praise His name forevermore.
[1676.80 --> 1677.80]  And I will rise among the saints.
[1677.80 --> 1678.80]  O praise His name forevermore.
[1678.80 --> 1685.80]  And I will rise above the Lord our God, O Lord, O Lord our God.
[1685.80 --> 1694.80]  Oh Lord, oh Lord our God
[1694.80 --> 1702.80]  Oh Lord, oh Lord our God
[1702.80 --> 1706.30]  You may have a seat.
[1715.80 --> 1736.80]  It is our great privilege together this morning to administer and participate in the sacrament of baptism to one of the little ones among us to Gus this morning.
[1736.80 --> 1747.94]  We do not believe as we come to this water that there's anything magical about the water that we apply to the child.
[1748.90 --> 1752.64]  The water does not wash away original sin or save the child.
[1753.18 --> 1759.04]  Only the life, death, resurrection, and exaltation of Jesus does that.
[1759.04 --> 1773.22]  And we believe that Gus, this child, is sinful by nature and we believe that the promises of God for forgiveness and life in the Holy Spirit are offered to him.
[1774.28 --> 1782.60]  We don't baptize babies out of superstition or even tradition, though we do have the weight of church history behind us,
[1782.98 --> 1788.30]  or because we like cute babies, even though that is a good thing.
[1788.30 --> 1799.96]  We baptize infants because we believe that they are covenant children and therefore should receive the sign of baptism, the sign of the covenant.
[1800.92 --> 1809.02]  And so while this isn't magical, it is a spiritual mystery that we live into together.
[1810.16 --> 1813.64]  In Genesis 15, God made a covenant with Abraham.
[1813.64 --> 1819.00]  This covenant was sealed with the sign of circumcision in Genesis 17.
[1819.86 --> 1822.38]  And God promised to bless Abraham.
[1823.02 --> 1827.12]  For Abraham, this meant two things in particular.
[1828.04 --> 1831.76]  One, it meant offspring, and two, it meant land.
[1832.80 --> 1840.82]  But at the heart of this covenant was God's promise that he would be a God to Abraham and his children.
[1840.82 --> 1848.74]  And God cut a covenant into Israel's flesh, carving out a people for himself.
[1849.58 --> 1858.40]  And they would be a light on the path home for humanity, for the expression of God's relationship to them.
[1858.94 --> 1865.74]  And in the fullness of time, God sent his only son, Jesus, to be our Savior.
[1865.74 --> 1871.58]  And in his death on the cross, our old self is dead and buried.
[1871.96 --> 1878.04]  And in his resurrection, we rise to a new life and we look forward to a new creation.
[1878.04 --> 1885.92]  When we are baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
[1886.22 --> 1891.22]  the triune God seals and promises our adoption as his children.
[1891.72 --> 1895.04]  And he writes his name invisibly on our foreheads.
[1896.38 --> 1897.64]  We read in Scripture,
[1897.64 --> 1918.56]  By baptism, we recognize a new identity in Jesus Christ.
[1918.56 --> 1927.34]  And so we come to administer this sacrament of baptism to Gus today with the weight of church history
[1927.34 --> 1932.90]  to encourage us and the example of redemptive history to confirm our practice.
[1933.20 --> 1936.72]  We baptize in obedience to Christ's command.
[1938.00 --> 1944.50]  The sacrament that we are about to administer is a sign of inclusion into the covenant community
[1944.50 --> 1947.08]  as circumcision was.
[1947.70 --> 1952.78]  And the water that we are about to pour over is a sign of cleansing from sin
[1952.78 --> 1956.84]  as the sprinkled blood of bulls and goats in the Old Testament was.
[1958.34 --> 1962.94]  And we pray that Gus will take advantage of all his covenant privileges,
[1962.94 --> 1966.42]  that he will acknowledge the Lord all the days of his life,
[1966.66 --> 1970.42]  and that by faith he will make these promises his own.
[1970.42 --> 1977.34]  So, Daniel and Ismay, I'm going to invite you and your family to come on up to the front.
[1991.42 --> 1992.62]  Just move right over.
[1992.62 --> 1993.22]  Yeah.
[1993.22 --> 2002.06]  Since you are presenting Gus for baptism,
[2002.24 --> 2006.44]  we're going to ask you the following questions before God and his people.
[2010.78 --> 2011.46]  First,
[2012.18 --> 2015.10]  do you believe that your children,
[2015.10 --> 2017.10]  though sinful by nature,
[2017.82 --> 2021.26]  are received by God in Christ as members of the covenant
[2021.26 --> 2023.68]  and therefore ought to be baptized?
[2024.52 --> 2025.36]  And second,
[2025.80 --> 2028.96]  do you promise in reliance on the Holy Spirit
[2028.96 --> 2031.54]  and with the help of the Christian community
[2031.54 --> 2033.44]  to do all in your power
[2033.44 --> 2035.40]  to instruct Gus
[2035.40 --> 2037.20]  and all your children
[2037.20 --> 2038.68]  in the Christian faith
[2038.68 --> 2041.50]  and to lead them by your example
[2041.50 --> 2044.46]  into the life of Christian discipleship?
[2045.84 --> 2047.52]  Daniel and Ismay,
[2047.70 --> 2048.54]  what is your answer?
[2048.54 --> 2049.26]  Amen.
[2054.08 --> 2055.26]  Our Lord Jesus said,
[2055.44 --> 2057.00]  let the little children come to me
[2057.00 --> 2058.26]  and do not hinder them
[2058.26 --> 2061.70]  for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
[2061.82 --> 2062.20]  And so,
[2062.32 --> 2064.54]  if you are a child among us,
[2064.92 --> 2066.34]  we want to invite you to come
[2066.34 --> 2067.88]  and just grab a seat right here
[2067.88 --> 2068.98]  on the floor
[2068.98 --> 2070.04]  in the splash zone
[2070.04 --> 2073.98]  that you might also see more closely
[2073.98 --> 2076.06]  what is happening here.
[2076.06 --> 2077.34]  Ruby,
[2077.44 --> 2077.82]  why don't you be,
[2077.88 --> 2078.26]  excellent,
[2078.40 --> 2078.96]  great example.
[2079.20 --> 2079.90]  Right by Ruby,
[2080.00 --> 2080.26]  guys.
[2098.26 --> 2099.14]  All right.
[2099.14 --> 2100.56]  So,
[2100.64 --> 2101.26]  in just a moment,
[2101.36 --> 2102.68]  we're going to take this water
[2102.68 --> 2105.84]  and we're going to put it on Gus's head
[2105.84 --> 2107.14]  and we're going to offer that
[2107.14 --> 2108.54]  as a symbol,
[2108.74 --> 2110.24]  as a sign and a seal,
[2110.60 --> 2111.26]  a promise
[2111.26 --> 2115.88]  that when God offers forgiveness to us,
[2116.02 --> 2117.08]  He washes us
[2117.08 --> 2119.02]  and makes us clean.
[2119.80 --> 2120.32]  Do you want to see?
[2120.46 --> 2121.60]  There's just a little water in there.
[2123.68 --> 2124.04]  Beautiful.
[2126.82 --> 2127.24]  All right.
[2127.28 --> 2128.04]  You want to come up here?
[2128.04 --> 2128.10]  All right.
[2128.10 --> 2128.14]  All right.
[2129.14 --> 2131.12]  It is an exciting day.
[2131.20 --> 2131.66]  Am I right?
[2134.60 --> 2134.96]  Emil?
[2138.34 --> 2138.82]  Gus,
[2139.22 --> 2139.78]  Emil,
[2140.16 --> 2140.74]  howling.
[2141.62 --> 2142.54]  I baptize you
[2142.54 --> 2143.60]  in the name of the Father
[2143.60 --> 2146.54]  and of the Son
[2146.54 --> 2149.50]  and of the Holy Spirit.
[2151.26 --> 2151.74]  Amen.
[2151.74 --> 2151.84]  Amen.
[2157.54 --> 2159.08]  Do you want that for your arm?
[2159.14 --> 2159.28]  God?
[2165.82 --> 2168.40]  Even as we have extended God's promise
[2168.40 --> 2169.98]  to the Howling family
[2169.98 --> 2171.78]  and to Gus here,
[2171.78 --> 2172.88]  we have an opportunity
[2172.88 --> 2174.04]  as a church family
[2174.04 --> 2176.78]  to also make promise to them.
[2177.60 --> 2177.78]  And so,
[2177.86 --> 2178.76]  I'm going to ask you,
[2179.00 --> 2179.30]  congregation,
[2179.60 --> 2180.02]  a question
[2180.02 --> 2181.60]  and then invite you to respond
[2181.60 --> 2183.44]  as you see on the screen.
[2183.44 --> 2184.70]  Do you,
[2184.70 --> 2186.22]  Langley,
[2186.34 --> 2186.72]  Emmanuel,
[2186.72 --> 2188.18]  friends and family
[2188.18 --> 2189.36]  of Daniel and Ismay
[2189.36 --> 2190.10]  and of Gus,
[2190.26 --> 2192.68]  do you promise to love,
[2192.94 --> 2193.30]  encourage,
[2193.54 --> 2194.34]  and support
[2194.34 --> 2195.78]  Daniel and Ismay,
[2195.90 --> 2196.22]  Olivia,
[2196.58 --> 2196.94]  Abe,
[2197.24 --> 2197.64]  Daphne,
[2197.74 --> 2198.62]  and now Gus
[2198.62 --> 2200.58]  by teaching the gospel
[2200.58 --> 2201.52]  of God's love,
[2202.08 --> 2203.18]  by being an example
[2203.18 --> 2204.30]  of Christian faith
[2204.30 --> 2205.26]  and character,
[2205.26 --> 2207.50]  and by giving the strong support
[2207.50 --> 2208.56]  of God's family
[2208.56 --> 2209.26]  in fellowship,
[2209.90 --> 2210.20]  prayer,
[2210.20 --> 2211.26]  and service?
[2211.48 --> 2212.40]  Church family,
[2212.50 --> 2213.24]  what is your answer?
[2213.98 --> 2215.60]  You are God.
[2216.38 --> 2217.06]  Amen.
[2218.26 --> 2219.32]  Let's offer a prayer
[2219.32 --> 2220.64]  of blessing
[2220.64 --> 2221.68]  over Gus
[2221.68 --> 2222.26]  together.
[2222.26 --> 2235.32]  Gus,
[2235.84 --> 2236.88]  Emil,
[2237.46 --> 2238.74]  the Lord bless you
[2238.74 --> 2239.92]  and keep you.
[2240.26 --> 2241.14]  The Lord make His face
[2241.14 --> 2242.00]  to shine upon you
[2242.00 --> 2243.62]  and be gracious to you.
[2243.62 --> 2245.44]  The Lord turn His face
[2245.44 --> 2246.12]  toward you
[2246.12 --> 2247.24]  and give you
[2247.24 --> 2248.68]  His peace.
[2249.50 --> 2250.54]  In this way,
[2250.72 --> 2251.74]  may the Lord
[2251.74 --> 2252.90]  write His name
[2252.90 --> 2253.66]  on you,
[2253.90 --> 2254.16]  Gus,
[2254.30 --> 2255.26]  and make you
[2255.26 --> 2256.50]  His own.
[2257.28 --> 2258.54]  In the name of Jesus Christ,
[2258.62 --> 2259.00]  we pray.
[2259.82 --> 2260.20]  Amen.
[2262.70 --> 2263.64]  At this point,
[2263.68 --> 2264.56]  I'd like to invite
[2264.56 --> 2265.28]  Seth
[2265.28 --> 2266.70]  to come forward.
[2266.84 --> 2267.28]  He is
[2267.28 --> 2268.56]  your elder
[2268.56 --> 2269.92]  and he has a gift
[2269.92 --> 2270.64]  and a memento
[2270.64 --> 2271.80]  of this occasion.
[2271.80 --> 2271.92]  Amen.
[2274.86 --> 2275.54]  Hello?
[2277.64 --> 2278.28]  Yeah.
[2281.74 --> 2290.80]  Oh, he's got a big smile
[2290.80 --> 2291.64]  on his face now.
[2292.32 --> 2293.54]  Either he likes baptism
[2293.54 --> 2294.44]  or he just pooped.
[2297.70 --> 2299.04]  Can we congratulate
[2299.04 --> 2300.52]  the Howling family together?
[2302.20 --> 2305.16]  You guys may go to your seats.
[2305.16 --> 2308.98]  As the kids,
[2309.06 --> 2310.02]  as you make your way back,
[2310.10 --> 2310.96]  we're all going to stand
[2310.96 --> 2312.34]  and sing a song together.
[2312.34 --> 2333.02]  God sent His Son.
[2333.02 --> 2334.06]  Teacher 1
[2334.06 --> 2334.90]  at 6 Again
[2334.90 --> 2336.52]  They called Him Jesus
[2336.52 --> 2337.18]  Jesus
[2337.18 --> 2338.46]  He ceremonial
[2338.46 --> 2339.52]  He took
[2339.52 --> 2340.28]  Hillary
[2340.28 --> 2341.60]  King
[2341.60 --> 2343.16]  Heal and forgive
[2343.16 --> 2344.10]  He came
[2344.10 --> 2346.40]  Heù
[2346.40 --> 2347.08]  He came
[2347.08 --> 2348.40]  and died
[2348.40 --> 2348.46]  He came
[2348.46 --> 2349.68]  to
[2349.68 --> 2350.08]  Die
[2350.08 --> 2350.24]  To
[2350.24 --> 2350.60]  my
[2350.60 --> 2352.12] 介
[2352.86 --> 2353.76]  And
[2353.76 --> 2354.80]  Empty
[2354.80 --> 2355.60]  Blining
[2355.60 --> 2356.18] ��
[2356.18 --> 2357.04]  From
[2357.04 --> 2358.12]  and
[2358.12 --> 2359.78]  Be
[2359.78 --> 2367.28]  Because He lives, I can face tomorrow
[2367.28 --> 2375.68]  Because He lives, all fear is gone
[2375.68 --> 2382.18]  Because I know He holds the future
[2382.18 --> 2390.62]  And life is worth the living just because He lives
[2390.62 --> 2397.72]  How sweet to hold a newborn baby
[2397.72 --> 2406.22]  And feel the pride and joy He gives
[2406.22 --> 2412.86]  But greater still, the calm assurance
[2412.86 --> 2418.00]  This child can face uncertain days
[2418.00 --> 2425.30]  Because He lives, because He lives
[2425.30 --> 2428.12]  I can face tomorrow
[2428.12 --> 2436.56]  Because He lives, all fear is gone
[2436.56 --> 2443.24]  Because I know He holds the future
[2443.24 --> 2451.80]  And life is worth the living just because He lives
[2451.80 --> 2459.04]  And then one day, I'll cross the river
[2459.04 --> 2466.74]  I'll fight by side, a war with me
[2466.74 --> 2474.40]  And then as death gives way to victory
[2474.40 --> 2478.56]  I'll see the lights of glory
[2478.56 --> 2482.84]  And although He reigns
[2482.84 --> 2489.54]  Because He lives, I can face tomorrow
[2489.54 --> 2497.16]  Because He lives, all fear is gone
[2497.16 --> 2504.96]  Because I know He holds the future
[2504.96 --> 2514.60]  And life is worth the living just because He lives
[2514.60 --> 2516.60]  Amen.
[2527.16 --> 2528.00]  Amen.
[2528.02 --> 2528.76]  Amen.

[2556.52 --> 2557.10]  Amen.
[2557.16 --> 2561.70]  Christ is risen. What a beautiful truth.
[2562.74 --> 2565.62]  My name is Emil. I'm a deacon here at Emanuel.
[2566.62 --> 2569.70]  And we continue our worship with the giving of our gifts
[2569.70 --> 2574.42]  for the budget, which covers the administration of the church
[2574.42 --> 2578.74]  and its ministries, and the special offering,
[2578.92 --> 2582.16]  which is for a world-renew Ukraine response.
[2582.96 --> 2587.10]  The Russian war against Ukraine is now in its 409th day.
[2587.86 --> 2590.74]  And many tens of thousands of Ukrainian
[2590.74 --> 2594.82]  and Russian soldiers have lost their lives in what appears
[2594.82 --> 2600.20]  to be a needless war prompted by one person's prideful
[2600.20 --> 2602.92]  and selfish need to correct history.
[2604.44 --> 2608.04]  The United Nations data shows that since the start of the war,
[2608.52 --> 2612.12]  more than 8,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed
[2612.54 --> 2614.74]  and another 14,000 injured.
[2614.74 --> 2619.90]  With most casualties caused by explosive weapons.
[2620.32 --> 2624.82]  More than 8 million Ukrainians have fled their country
[2624.82 --> 2628.16]  and become refugees across Europe.
[2628.16 --> 2637.82]  And many of these refugees are mothers with children whose husbands have been conscripted
[2637.82 --> 2641.82]  to fight against the Russian invasion.
[2641.82 --> 2648.40]  And 5.3 million are displaced within Ukraine.
[2649.40 --> 2653.70]  World Renew has assets in place in Ukraine
[2653.70 --> 2657.44]  and they are working with other agencies and churches
[2657.44 --> 2663.12]  to provide food, clothing, and spiritual aid for those that are displaced in Ukraine.
[2663.12 --> 2668.34]  We pray that the work done will bring comfort to those who are in need
[2668.34 --> 2670.92]  and that the spirit will bear fruit.
[2672.04 --> 2676.06]  We also pray for a quick and just resolution of this war.
[2676.88 --> 2677.96]  Please give generously.
[2677.96 --> 2683.16]  Do not neglect to do good and to share what you have
[2683.16 --> 2686.42]  for such sacrifices are pleasing to God.
[2687.00 --> 2688.80]  Hebrews 13 verse 16.
[2689.62 --> 2693.06]  Next week's offering is for the budget and gems.
[2693.90 --> 2706.50]  translation of Time
[2706.50 --> 2736.48]  Thank you.
[2736.50 --> 2766.48]  Thank you.
[2766.50 --> 2796.48]  Thank you.
[2796.50 --> 2826.48]  Thank you.
[2826.50 --> 2856.48]  Thank you.
[2856.50 --> 2886.48]  Thank you.
[2886.50 --> 2916.48]  Thank you.
[2916.50 --> 2946.48]  Thank you.
[2946.50 --> 2948.50]  Thank you.
[2948.50 --> 2976.48]  Thank you.
[2976.68 --> 2978.48]  Thank you.
[2978.48 --> 3006.46]  Thank you.
[3006.46 --> 3013.18]  does
[3036.46 --> 3055.38]  Good morning.
[3055.38 --> 3055.96]  Good morning.
[3057.34 --> 3060.74]  Before we go to God in prayer, just a couple of announcements.
[3061.84 --> 3064.58]  We have a full council meeting on Tuesday night.
[3064.58 --> 3070.80]  It starts with dinner at 6, and we will listen to stories from a couple of Mexico mission
[3070.80 --> 3080.38]  trip team members, and the class's BCSE restorative practices task force will do a presentation
[3080.38 --> 3081.42]  and training.
[3083.06 --> 3091.68]  And this next one was also written up for me, but I totally endorse and love the announcement.
[3093.22 --> 3094.26]  We're excited.
[3094.58 --> 3100.40]  We're not quite as excited as Easter morning, but we're excited to officially welcome Maria
[3100.40 --> 3101.96]  Nguyen to the staff of our church.
[3103.08 --> 3103.94]  You can clap.
[3109.34 --> 3116.12]  Maria is working as a new communications administrator and ordinarily will be in the office on Tuesdays
[3116.12 --> 3120.56]  and Thursdays between 9 and 2.30ish.
[3121.94 --> 3128.36]  Maria, we are grateful for your love for our church, and our prayer is that God will use
[3128.36 --> 3130.00]  you among us all.
[3130.00 --> 3137.68]  God, this morning when I pray, I'm going to just stop for a few seconds, and then we'll
[3137.68 --> 3139.32]  recite the Lord's Prayer together.
[3140.38 --> 3141.08]  Should we pray?
[3141.08 --> 3148.68]  Our Father, Lord, in heaven, Lord, thank you.
[3150.14 --> 3152.52]  Thank you that we can come and celebrate this morning.
[3153.40 --> 3159.22]  Lord, of all the stuff that's going on in this world, the stuff each one of us is dealing with,
[3159.22 --> 3165.18]  be it waiting for surgery, be it treatments.
[3165.18 --> 3175.38]  Lord, we pray will you help each one of us to focus on this morning, the morning that we celebrate your rising.
[3175.74 --> 3186.54]  Lord, how awesome that you died for each and every one of us, but it requires a choice for us, Lord.
[3186.54 --> 3203.16]  Lord, we pray will you lead us to that choice, where we all know of people, kids, grandkids, relatives that no longer worship, no longer feel a need.
[3204.22 --> 3206.96]  We ask you, Lord, to touch every one of them this morning.
[3206.96 --> 3217.36]  May you help them to think about this morning and the great and glorious deed that was done.
[3217.46 --> 3223.28]  Lord, we think of the entire week or the two weeks before Easter morning and then that empty tomb.
[3224.82 --> 3234.60]  And then when you stood before Mary and said that you were going to see your God and our God, your Lord and our Lord.
[3234.60 --> 3237.50]  Lord, thank you that we can call you Lord and Savior.
[3237.68 --> 3239.88]  Thank you that we can come to you.
[3240.06 --> 3241.28]  Help us to come to you, Lord.
[3241.32 --> 3243.82]  Help us to read your word.
[3244.00 --> 3247.06]  You sent a letter, a big letter to each one of us.
[3247.14 --> 3247.78]  Do we read it?
[3248.00 --> 3248.96]  Help us to read it, Lord.
[3251.12 --> 3255.12]  We pray will you help us to come to you in prayer.
[3257.46 --> 3260.56]  Lord, we ask you to help us focus on today.
[3261.40 --> 3263.60]  Lord, there's so many things going on.
[3264.60 --> 3267.76]  And yet the most beautiful thing of all we celebrate this morning.
[3271.06 --> 3275.68]  Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be your name.
[3276.58 --> 3277.88]  Your kingdom come.
[3278.68 --> 3281.94]  Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[3282.94 --> 3284.98]  Give us our daily bread.
[3286.06 --> 3289.62]  Give us our debts as we forgive our debtors.
[3289.62 --> 3294.74]  Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[3295.88 --> 3299.66]  For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory forever.
[3300.76 --> 3301.10]  Amen.
[3319.62 --> 3340.68]  This morning in our Easter worship, we're going to look at one of the stories that happened early on after Jesus was resurrected.
[3340.68 --> 3347.62]  And we're going to do that in the Gospel of John, where we have been reflecting this Holy Week season.
[3348.46 --> 3353.18]  And so I'm going to read from John 20, starting at verse 24.
[3353.18 --> 3355.56]  Then I'll read through 31.
[3355.92 --> 3357.72]  That will be on the screen behind me.
[3357.78 --> 3366.60]  But if you have a Bible, of course, I encourage you to have that open and in your hands or turned on as we go through it together.
[3369.34 --> 3371.38]  Together, then, let's hear the word of the Lord.
[3371.38 --> 3382.10]  Now, Thomas, also known as Didymus, one of the twelve, was not with the disciples when he came to Jesus.
[3383.00 --> 3385.34]  So the other disciples told him,
[3385.82 --> 3387.20]  We have seen the Lord.
[3387.20 --> 3389.94]  But he said to them,
[3391.16 --> 3402.38]  Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.
[3404.50 --> 3409.78]  A week later, his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them.
[3410.44 --> 3415.06]  Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said,
[3415.50 --> 3416.72]  Peace be with you.
[3417.20 --> 3420.68]  Then he turned to Thomas and said,
[3421.90 --> 3423.18]  Put your finger here.
[3423.96 --> 3425.58]  See my hands.
[3425.94 --> 3428.48]  Reach your hand and put it into my side.
[3428.90 --> 3431.14]  Stop doubting and believe.
[3432.82 --> 3434.38]  Thomas said to him,
[3435.42 --> 3437.54]  My Lord and my God.
[3439.06 --> 3441.02]  Then Jesus told him,
[3441.84 --> 3445.40]  Because you have seen me, you have believed.
[3445.40 --> 3450.92]  Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.
[3450.92 --> 3459.52]  Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book.
[3459.52 --> 3473.08]  But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.
[3473.08 --> 3475.18]  This is the word of the Lord.
[3475.68 --> 3484.40]  Now, I've said it already, and I've talked to a number of you about this.
[3484.40 --> 3488.28]  I love Resurrection Sunday.
[3488.28 --> 3493.12]  And I love it for a whole host of reasons.
[3493.72 --> 3499.86]  Because today changed everything throughout history.
[3499.86 --> 3508.08]  But to begin this morning, I want to talk a little bit about something else that has changed.
[3508.08 --> 3511.20]  Because something is different.
[3511.20 --> 3516.40]  Now, don't jump to conclusions about what you think that might be.
[3516.48 --> 3522.20]  Because I'm not just talking about the tomb being empty, as if we can just talk about that.
[3523.16 --> 3523.64]  Right?
[3523.68 --> 3530.00]  There's no way to overstate the impact of the empty tomb, to overstate the meaning of the resurrection.
[3530.00 --> 3543.84]  But for a minute this morning, I want to just live into the reality with you that something else has changed.
[3543.84 --> 3549.60]  And I would guess that you, perhaps not in this moment, right?
[3549.66 --> 3557.94]  Because it's really easy to believe and to have joy of belief even as we come and gather as a church.
[3557.94 --> 3565.00]  But I would guess that the change that I'm talking about, most of us feel more than we can even describe it.
[3566.32 --> 3566.80]  Right?
[3566.82 --> 3573.28]  We live in this change more than you can define exactly what it is.
[3575.30 --> 3578.90]  If you're a Christian here with us this morning, this Easter Sunday,
[3579.34 --> 3584.48]  maybe you feel that a little bit more poignantly, a little bit more heavily right now.
[3584.48 --> 3584.68]  Right?
[3584.68 --> 3590.58]  There's something about the weight of glory and the beauty of moments like these.
[3591.82 --> 3598.52]  But at exactly the same time as our hearts are being pulled up in worship,
[3598.52 --> 3606.64]  it almost feels like our feet are being pulled down into the sinking sand of the ground.
[3607.52 --> 3607.62]  Right?
[3607.62 --> 3616.56]  Our imaginations, on the one hand, are being stretched towards the transcendent even as the frame below holds us back.
[3618.60 --> 3622.36]  You see, it used to be easier.
[3624.08 --> 3627.62]  Now, if you're older than I am, I'm about to turn 40.
[3627.76 --> 3629.40]  Actually, in a week, I will turn 40.
[3629.40 --> 3635.30]  If you're older than me, you will probably see this or know this a little bit more clearly.
[3636.04 --> 3636.40]  Right?
[3636.46 --> 3641.46]  Because you grew up in a time, in a world, that used to know what was up and what was down.
[3642.28 --> 3642.44]  Right?
[3642.46 --> 3644.92]  The lines used to be drawn a whole lot more clearly.
[3645.24 --> 3648.36]  We used to kind of know what was sacred and what was secular.
[3648.58 --> 3651.10]  We used to have a religious sphere and a public sphere.
[3651.10 --> 3654.24]  And yeah, things kind of crossed over and there were some outliers.
[3654.66 --> 3659.24]  But the definitions, generally speaking, in the culture were clear.
[3660.50 --> 3662.40]  Fact and faith.
[3662.98 --> 3667.26]  Either you saw them in agreement or you saw them in juxtaposition.
[3668.36 --> 3668.80]  Right?
[3668.88 --> 3669.52]  In conflict.
[3670.64 --> 3673.86]  But the categories used to be obvious.
[3675.12 --> 3680.24]  And maybe, again, especially if you're older than I am, you still see the world like that.
[3680.24 --> 3682.32]  That's still how the world should be.
[3682.64 --> 3683.42]  A binary.
[3683.62 --> 3684.52]  Either or.
[3684.66 --> 3685.46]  One or the other.
[3685.92 --> 3692.88]  But the thing that has changed, the reality for most of us living in a 21st century western world.
[3694.28 --> 3696.46]  Again, here, if you're younger than me.
[3696.86 --> 3698.62]  Especially if you're in your 20s.
[3698.68 --> 3700.78]  But definitely if you're a teenager.
[3701.36 --> 3701.50]  Right?
[3701.56 --> 3703.10]  Because this is where it gets even harder.
[3703.60 --> 3706.54]  The world actually doesn't feel any different to you.
[3707.14 --> 3709.12]  Because this is just the way it's always been.
[3710.24 --> 3710.88]  Right?
[3710.92 --> 3721.42]  The neat categories of faith and fact have blurred or they have blended what was once either or now exists in the struggle of both and.
[3722.82 --> 3728.02]  And maybe that's the best way to understand this kind of cultural moment.
[3728.12 --> 3732.52]  That's the best way to articulate the change that we're living in the midst of.
[3732.52 --> 3732.70]  Right?
[3732.70 --> 3741.40]  At exactly the same time that I know this to be true, precisely then, I also know it's impossible.
[3743.54 --> 3744.14]  Right?
[3744.18 --> 3750.68]  My heart longs for eternity, for something more, for transcendence, for something bigger, for something beyond me.
[3750.68 --> 3754.16]  And yet, the world feels closed.
[3755.74 --> 3756.30]  Right?
[3756.36 --> 3762.30]  In the day-to-day systems and movements of life and faith, the world is small.
[3762.44 --> 3763.20]  Too small.
[3764.10 --> 3764.30]  Right?
[3764.30 --> 3764.82]  So small.
[3764.82 --> 3769.26]  So small that anything I could ever need is a call or a text or a DM or a tap away.
[3770.54 --> 3782.52]  And even as I feel this haunting for more, like a spectral affection just beyond my reach, it's slipping palpably through my fingers.
[3782.52 --> 3783.20]  Skepticism.
[3785.62 --> 3792.16]  Skepticism wells up and it pulls us firmly back to the ground.
[3794.32 --> 3799.28]  And I don't think I'm just describing myself when I talk like that.
[3800.62 --> 3801.16]  Right?
[3801.22 --> 3808.68]  When we're honest about it, I feel like Thomas or what I imagine Thomas would have felt like there.
[3808.74 --> 3810.40]  I want you to notice something.
[3810.40 --> 3814.00]  We said it almost in passing as we read it.
[3814.06 --> 3815.84]  So maybe we missed it, but I'll read it again.
[3816.00 --> 3817.26]  Thomas is told,
[3817.40 --> 3818.38]  We have seen the Lord.
[3818.44 --> 3818.96]  And he says,
[3819.08 --> 3824.42]  Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my fingers where the nails were and put my hands into his side,
[3824.80 --> 3828.62]  unless I have all this evidence, he says, I will not believe.
[3830.86 --> 3835.30]  Now, you've got to imagine, right, that Thomas wanted to believe.
[3835.30 --> 3843.52]  And actually, from a strictly rational perspective now, he should have.
[3844.04 --> 3853.44]  Because he is justified, rationally speaking, justified in believing his friends, his most trusted companions,
[3853.70 --> 3856.68]  when they told him what had happened, that they had seen the Lord.
[3857.48 --> 3858.08]  Do you know what I mean?
[3858.08 --> 3866.66]  It is actually more reasonable to believe your trusted friends, those whom you love,
[3866.72 --> 3872.26]  when they tell you something, even something that seems impossible, than to not believe them.
[3872.26 --> 3874.32]  Right?
[3874.40 --> 3879.28]  Because of your relationship and your experience of them, because of your mutual love for them,
[3879.34 --> 3883.06]  it is more rational to believe them when they say things like that.
[3885.76 --> 3892.38]  No one, I think, made this point more beautifully and simply than C.S. Lewis.
[3892.78 --> 3897.10]  There's a point early on in the story, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.
[3897.10 --> 3901.10]  Okay, in the story of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, early on,
[3901.40 --> 3905.94]  Lucy has gone through the wardrobe into the land of Narnia,
[3906.32 --> 3909.94]  and Edmund has also gone through and followed her.
[3911.08 --> 3915.50]  Lucy comes back and she tells her older brother and sister, Peter and Susan,
[3915.74 --> 3917.80]  what she has seen and what she has witnessed,
[3918.08 --> 3921.20]  and Edmund comes and says, no, no, no, it's all a joke.
[3922.06 --> 3923.88]  It's not real, we were just playing.
[3924.88 --> 3926.70]  Peter and Susan don't know what to do.
[3927.10 --> 3930.10]  And so they go and they talk to the professor,
[3930.68 --> 3933.06]  who lives in the house where they are staying at.
[3933.88 --> 3935.72]  They tell him the whole story.
[3936.56 --> 3940.44]  And after listening and thinking and sitting quietly for a moment,
[3940.58 --> 3941.54]  the professor says,
[3942.68 --> 3946.24]  how do you know that your sister's story isn't true?
[3948.38 --> 3950.72]  And Susan, Lewis writes, hesitates,
[3950.96 --> 3953.46]  but sees that the question is genuine and says,
[3953.98 --> 3955.92]  but Edmund said that they'd only been pretending.
[3957.10 --> 3959.04]  The professor responds, that's the point,
[3959.26 --> 3962.24]  which certainly deserves very careful consideration.
[3962.66 --> 3965.60]  For instance, if you will excuse me for asking the question,
[3966.02 --> 3971.30]  does your experience lead you to regard your brother or your sister as more reliable?
[3971.30 --> 3974.28]  I mean, which is the more truthful?
[3975.72 --> 3978.12]  Peter and Susan both say, Lucy.
[3979.00 --> 3981.64]  And Susan adds, but this couldn't be true,
[3981.78 --> 3987.76]  all this about a wood through a wardrobe and a fawn who met her and offered her food.
[3988.36 --> 3990.38]  The professor says, well, that's more than I know.
[3990.96 --> 3995.32]  And a charge of lying against someone whom you have always found truthful
[3995.32 --> 4000.92]  is a very serious thing, a very serious thing indeed.
[4002.54 --> 4007.62]  And Susan goes, what if it's not lying, but something more?
[4009.26 --> 4011.34]  Madness, you mean, the professor asks?
[4012.18 --> 4015.42]  One only has to look at her to see she is not mad.
[4015.42 --> 4020.18]  But then, hesitates Susan, and the professor interrupts,
[4020.22 --> 4020.88]  and this is the point.
[4021.40 --> 4022.40]  He says, logic.
[4023.84 --> 4026.24]  Why don't they teach logic at schools anymore?
[4027.32 --> 4028.96]  He says, there are only three possibilities.
[4030.06 --> 4031.94]  Either your sister is telling lies,
[4032.32 --> 4033.52]  or she is mad,
[4033.78 --> 4035.16]  or she's telling the truth.
[4036.16 --> 4038.08]  You know that she doesn't tell lies.
[4038.24 --> 4039.72]  She's obviously not mad.
[4039.72 --> 4042.08]  For the moment, then,
[4042.70 --> 4044.96]  unless any further evidence turns up,
[4045.04 --> 4045.90]  the professor continues,
[4046.18 --> 4049.08]  we must assume that she is telling the truth.
[4050.96 --> 4054.96]  It's more logical to believe people you know to be truthful and to trust.
[4055.40 --> 4059.84]  Thomas could have reasonably believed in that moment,
[4060.36 --> 4062.90]  because he knows and trusts the disciples.
[4064.30 --> 4065.90]  This is true for us,
[4066.00 --> 4068.92]  just like it is and was for Thomas.
[4068.92 --> 4069.40]  Right?
[4069.48 --> 4071.38]  He probably wanted to believe,
[4071.82 --> 4075.82]  and he knows that he can trust his brothers and sisters that are around him,
[4075.92 --> 4078.14]  but still he struggles.
[4079.00 --> 4081.66]  And then, here's the part that's easy to miss.
[4082.02 --> 4082.52]  Thomas says,
[4082.62 --> 4084.26]  unless I put my fingers in the nail marks,
[4084.32 --> 4085.12]  my hand in his side,
[4085.20 --> 4086.24]  I will not believe.
[4086.78 --> 4087.62]  A week later,
[4087.74 --> 4089.54]  his disciples were in the house again,
[4089.66 --> 4090.78]  and Thomas was with them.
[4092.34 --> 4093.52]  Did you catch it that time?
[4095.00 --> 4096.72]  A week later.
[4098.92 --> 4100.64]  A whole week has gone by.
[4101.32 --> 4101.40]  Right?
[4101.46 --> 4106.82]  It's an entire week that Thomas has made his famous statement of,
[4107.04 --> 4107.80]  unless I see,
[4107.94 --> 4108.74]  I will not believe.
[4109.74 --> 4111.34]  And then, finally,
[4111.70 --> 4116.76]  Jesus appears to him and accepts his challenge for proof.
[4116.82 --> 4119.40]  A week before there is proof.
[4119.40 --> 4121.98]  And like I said,
[4122.04 --> 4124.98]  maybe this is more true for me right now than it is for you,
[4125.12 --> 4126.58]  but I really suspect it's not.
[4126.86 --> 4127.04]  Right?
[4127.08 --> 4129.98]  I think that that week of Thomas' life,
[4130.12 --> 4131.44]  in the challenge of belief,
[4131.52 --> 4133.54]  in the constant pulling down pressure of doubt,
[4133.90 --> 4134.78]  knowing that you should,
[4134.86 --> 4136.34]  but feeling like you can't,
[4136.44 --> 4137.44]  feeling like you do,
[4137.54 --> 4138.90]  but knowing that it's impossible.
[4139.30 --> 4139.54]  Right?
[4139.54 --> 4148.52]  That week of Thomas' life defines the age and experience of faith for us in the world today.
[4149.10 --> 4150.64]  This is where we live.
[4152.00 --> 4153.50]  And here's the thing, right?
[4153.60 --> 4155.08]  It's not just Christians.
[4155.90 --> 4158.68]  It's all of us in this moment.
[4159.46 --> 4163.88]  The human condition is to love and to desire and to believe.
[4163.88 --> 4166.60]  Now, we might use different words for it,
[4166.86 --> 4169.82]  but that pull of eternity on your heart,
[4169.94 --> 4172.10]  that unsettled, that restless wandering,
[4172.28 --> 4176.28]  that not completely satisfied longing for an experience of beauty,
[4177.12 --> 4181.72]  yet simultaneously being distinctly bound to the ground,
[4182.02 --> 4184.62]  looking for what is and knowing what's not.
[4187.12 --> 4189.50]  We're all Thomas now.
[4189.50 --> 4194.04]  That's the title of this message.
[4194.18 --> 4195.18]  We're all Thomas now.
[4195.30 --> 4198.68]  And I borrowed it from a book that I read
[4198.68 --> 4203.36]  that has helped me understand myself and my faith and the world we live in.
[4203.72 --> 4206.46]  It's a book that I highly recommend.
[4206.70 --> 4207.64]  It's a little book.
[4207.74 --> 4211.12]  It's easily read by Jamie Smith called How Not to Be Secular.
[4211.24 --> 4213.92]  And it's about a big book by Charles Taylor,
[4214.10 --> 4215.46]  a Catholic social philosopher.
[4215.72 --> 4217.56]  That's, you know, 1,400 pages,
[4217.56 --> 4219.14]  so that one's a little more difficult to read.
[4219.50 --> 4221.56]  Jamie Smith writes, he says,
[4222.22 --> 4222.42]  quote,
[4222.72 --> 4226.08]  Even as faith endures in our secular age,
[4226.22 --> 4228.32]  believing doesn't come easy.
[4229.64 --> 4230.74]  Faith is fraught.
[4231.36 --> 4235.38]  Confession is haunted by an inescapable sense of its contestability.
[4236.00 --> 4238.68]  We don't believe instead of doubting.
[4239.10 --> 4241.32]  We believe while doubting.
[4241.94 --> 4243.92]  We're all Thomas now.
[4245.48 --> 4247.10]  And all means all, right?
[4247.10 --> 4249.32]  This is the life of faith that I know,
[4249.44 --> 4251.26]  and I bet that most of you do.
[4252.00 --> 4253.38]  And that's the new thing.
[4255.06 --> 4258.14]  But it's also the struggle of faith for everyone,
[4258.34 --> 4260.00]  for agnostic, for atheist,
[4260.22 --> 4263.76]  for the most committed post-modern, post-Christian person.
[4264.90 --> 4266.28]  Paul Ellie says,
[4266.28 --> 4269.90]  We're all skeptics now, believer and unbeliever alike.
[4270.30 --> 4272.76]  Believer and unbeliever are in the same predicament,
[4273.18 --> 4276.20]  thrown back onto themselves in complex circumstances,
[4276.72 --> 4277.66]  looking for a sign.
[4279.40 --> 4283.60]  There's another writer who defines her experience of faith or its lack
[4283.60 --> 4284.84]  by saying,
[4285.22 --> 4286.38]  I don't believe in God,
[4287.18 --> 4288.12]  but I miss him.
[4289.66 --> 4290.12]  Right?
[4290.12 --> 4292.42]  Something has changed.
[4292.62 --> 4296.58]  And Smith says that the doubter's doubt is faith.
[4297.24 --> 4298.78]  His temptation is belief.
[4299.18 --> 4302.16]  And it is a temptation that has not entirely been quelled,
[4302.50 --> 4304.34]  even in our secular age.
[4304.34 --> 4312.22]  And it's now into the midst of this existential space,
[4312.36 --> 4314.42]  into the midst of this,
[4314.64 --> 4316.28]  what was a week in Thomas' life
[4316.28 --> 4318.46]  and what defines most of our experiences,
[4318.68 --> 4322.26]  that the resurrection of Jesus bursts through.
[4323.06 --> 4323.26]  Right?
[4323.28 --> 4325.82]  Even as we oscillate between faith and doubt,
[4325.96 --> 4326.94]  assurance and skepticism,
[4327.14 --> 4328.38]  conviction and complacency,
[4328.68 --> 4330.14]  and not really even oscillate,
[4330.18 --> 4332.38]  because we're pulled up and pushed down
[4332.38 --> 4333.60]  at the same time.
[4334.20 --> 4334.32]  Right?
[4334.38 --> 4335.66]  Into this reality,
[4335.92 --> 4337.48]  transcendence and the resurrection
[4337.48 --> 4340.40]  comes crashing through the neat and organized
[4340.40 --> 4343.32]  and bordered and bounded pictures of reality
[4343.32 --> 4344.98]  that we have so carefully crafted,
[4345.22 --> 4346.74]  and it just messes it all up.
[4347.94 --> 4351.90]  And it's a beautiful, messy mystery.
[4353.78 --> 4354.96]  That's just it.
[4355.70 --> 4357.78]  The mystery is messy,
[4357.78 --> 4362.42]  and faith won't be confined to our propositional boxes,
[4362.74 --> 4365.98]  just like Jesus won't be confined to a grave.
[4367.70 --> 4368.82]  Let me say that again.
[4369.18 --> 4370.72]  The mystery is messy,
[4370.88 --> 4373.48]  and faith won't be confined to our propositional boxes,
[4373.48 --> 4377.04]  just like Jesus won't be confined to a grave.
[4377.04 --> 4382.42]  Now, notice this,
[4382.52 --> 4390.60]  because I think that this is one of the most powerful parts of the story.
[4392.02 --> 4394.42]  When Thomas does see Jesus,
[4394.90 --> 4395.10]  right,
[4396.08 --> 4399.06]  his tests for truthfulness,
[4399.30 --> 4399.46]  right,
[4399.48 --> 4401.88]  his need to put his hand in the side
[4401.88 --> 4403.18]  and to touch the holes,
[4403.26 --> 4404.76]  his tests for truthfulness
[4404.76 --> 4407.34]  fall away to worship,
[4407.60 --> 4408.96]  and all he can say is,
[4409.18 --> 4410.76]  my Lord and my God.
[4413.46 --> 4414.26]  You see,
[4415.26 --> 4418.16]  I believe
[4418.16 --> 4420.38]  that we make a mistake
[4420.38 --> 4422.56]  when we think Easter
[4422.56 --> 4425.88]  is all about proving
[4425.88 --> 4428.98]  God has power over sin and death.
[4429.22 --> 4429.36]  Now,
[4429.98 --> 4431.30]  don't hear what I'm not saying.
[4432.66 --> 4433.78]  Easter does that.
[4433.78 --> 4435.82]  Easter proves that.
[4435.90 --> 4437.54]  The empty tomb does that.
[4437.58 --> 4438.56]  It is proof,
[4438.62 --> 4438.80]  right?
[4438.90 --> 4440.00]  Jesus says to Thomas,
[4440.12 --> 4441.48]  here is your proof.
[4441.56 --> 4442.90]  I am your proof.
[4443.04 --> 4444.30]  But this story,
[4444.68 --> 4446.38]  especially this one about Thomas,
[4446.72 --> 4447.62]  especially here,
[4447.86 --> 4449.44]  is not about proving,
[4450.48 --> 4450.66]  right?
[4450.74 --> 4452.68]  Thomas' need for proof
[4452.68 --> 4453.94]  is the foil
[4453.94 --> 4456.68]  through which we get to the heart of the matter,
[4456.94 --> 4458.16]  through which we get to the point.
[4459.06 --> 4460.42]  Thomas' need for proof
[4460.42 --> 4461.34]  is the foil
[4461.34 --> 4462.58]  that points us
[4462.58 --> 4463.94]  to his words,
[4464.08 --> 4464.72]  my Lord
[4464.72 --> 4465.88]  and my God.
[4466.94 --> 4468.20]  This isn't about proving.
[4468.62 --> 4469.84]  This is about stirring.
[4470.70 --> 4472.00]  This isn't about effect,
[4472.14 --> 4473.06]  though that is huge.
[4473.20 --> 4474.16]  This is about affect.
[4474.54 --> 4476.34]  This is about stone becoming flesh,
[4476.42 --> 4477.76]  about dead coming alive.
[4477.82 --> 4478.60]  This is about light
[4478.60 --> 4479.96]  shining in the darkness.
[4480.32 --> 4481.54]  This is about new
[4481.54 --> 4483.54]  resurrection life,
[4484.08 --> 4486.14]  imaginations becoming alive
[4486.14 --> 4487.62]  for the impossible
[4487.62 --> 4489.42]  and the possible
[4489.42 --> 4490.78]  becoming possible
[4490.78 --> 4492.12]  because the tomb
[4492.12 --> 4493.46]  is empty
[4493.46 --> 4495.72]  and just like Thomas.
[4497.06 --> 4498.40]  Into the weakness
[4498.40 --> 4500.34]  of a weak fort
[4500.34 --> 4501.18]  that has for us
[4501.18 --> 4502.12]  been a lifetime,
[4502.66 --> 4503.74]  Jesus today
[4503.74 --> 4505.26]  stands in front of you
[4505.26 --> 4507.00]  and he asks to be seen.
[4507.38 --> 4508.96]  Jesus stands in front of you
[4508.96 --> 4510.58]  and he asks to be heard.
[4510.70 --> 4512.32]  In the midst of your doubts,
[4512.84 --> 4513.50]  Jesus says,
[4513.50 --> 4515.42]  come in the midst
[4515.42 --> 4517.66]  and to offer your assurance,
[4517.86 --> 4518.54]  Jesus says,
[4518.84 --> 4520.96]  go to your questions.
[4521.18 --> 4521.64]  He says,
[4521.76 --> 4522.10]  yes,
[4522.38 --> 4523.30]  ask me more.
[4524.40 --> 4525.46]  In your wandering,
[4525.70 --> 4527.38]  he calls forth wonder
[4527.38 --> 4530.12]  and he says,
[4531.06 --> 4532.16]  blessed are those
[4532.16 --> 4533.28]  who have not seen
[4533.28 --> 4536.22]  and yet have believed.
[4537.90 --> 4540.20]  These are the very words
[4540.20 --> 4541.88]  of Jesus spoken
[4541.88 --> 4543.84]  about you.
[4545.60 --> 4546.20]  You,
[4546.42 --> 4547.76]  2,000 years later,
[4548.64 --> 4549.94]  have not seen
[4549.94 --> 4551.20]  and yet believed.
[4551.36 --> 4552.66]  Jesus is speaking
[4552.66 --> 4554.06]  to you.
[4555.62 --> 4556.14]  Believe
[4556.14 --> 4558.16]  and you are blessed.
[4558.38 --> 4558.72]  Believe
[4558.72 --> 4560.08]  even in the week
[4560.08 --> 4560.80]  of doubt
[4560.80 --> 4562.62]  and he is with you.
[4562.78 --> 4563.06]  Believe
[4563.06 --> 4564.34]  even as you doubt
[4564.34 --> 4565.40]  and you are giving
[4565.40 --> 4566.46]  something more
[4566.46 --> 4567.10]  than your heart
[4567.10 --> 4568.38]  could ever ask
[4568.38 --> 4569.08]  or imagine
[4569.08 --> 4570.72]  but the exact same thing
[4570.72 --> 4571.46]  that your heart
[4571.46 --> 4572.46]  was created for.
[4573.28 --> 4574.96]  Even as we feel
[4574.96 --> 4575.68]  rootless
[4575.68 --> 4576.62]  and unsure,
[4577.04 --> 4577.82]  he brings
[4577.82 --> 4578.88]  a rootedness
[4578.88 --> 4580.34]  and a certainty
[4580.34 --> 4582.42]  because here's the thing,
[4583.22 --> 4583.80]  this
[4583.80 --> 4585.84]  is
[4585.84 --> 4587.32]  history.
[4588.74 --> 4589.98]  The historical evidence
[4589.98 --> 4590.64]  for the resurrection
[4590.64 --> 4591.12]  of Jesus
[4591.12 --> 4591.90]  is profound
[4591.90 --> 4593.10]  and it is compelling
[4593.10 --> 4594.40]  but here
[4594.40 --> 4595.60]  is what we need
[4595.60 --> 4596.12]  to remember,
[4596.46 --> 4596.62]  right?
[4596.62 --> 4597.88]  No matter how strong
[4597.88 --> 4598.50]  your doubts
[4598.50 --> 4599.38]  are,
[4599.76 --> 4601.60]  history does not change.
[4602.92 --> 4603.02]  Right?
[4603.08 --> 4604.16]  Jesus isn't like
[4604.16 --> 4604.70]  Tinkerbell
[4604.70 --> 4605.64]  from Peter Pan
[4605.64 --> 4607.12]  or like the gods
[4607.12 --> 4608.60]  from Neil Gaiman's book
[4608.60 --> 4609.48]  American Gods,
[4609.78 --> 4609.92]  right?
[4609.96 --> 4610.58]  All of whom
[4610.58 --> 4611.96]  need the belief
[4611.96 --> 4613.16]  of people in the world
[4613.16 --> 4613.82]  in order for them
[4613.82 --> 4614.32]  to exist
[4614.32 --> 4614.98]  and to continue
[4614.98 --> 4615.56]  to exist.
[4615.96 --> 4617.12]  This is history
[4617.12 --> 4619.08]  and what you feel
[4619.08 --> 4619.64]  about it
[4619.64 --> 4620.86]  or what you believe
[4620.86 --> 4621.50]  about it
[4621.50 --> 4622.76]  or don't feel
[4622.76 --> 4623.20]  about it
[4623.20 --> 4623.82]  or don't believe
[4623.82 --> 4624.26]  about it
[4624.26 --> 4625.14]  doesn't change
[4625.14 --> 4625.74]  the fact.
[4626.62 --> 4627.82]  That the tomb
[4627.82 --> 4628.40]  was empty
[4628.40 --> 4630.96]  and that he is raised.
[4634.16 --> 4635.36]  As if to make the point
[4635.36 --> 4636.20]  that this is history,
[4636.36 --> 4638.32]  John ends this section
[4638.32 --> 4638.82]  and saying,
[4638.96 --> 4639.72]  Jesus performed
[4639.72 --> 4640.70]  many other signs
[4640.70 --> 4641.22]  in the presence
[4641.22 --> 4641.98]  of his disciples
[4641.98 --> 4643.46]  which are not recorded
[4643.46 --> 4644.14]  in this book
[4644.14 --> 4646.26]  but these are written
[4646.26 --> 4648.30]  that you may believe
[4648.30 --> 4650.04]  that Jesus is the Messiah,
[4650.18 --> 4650.90]  the Son of God
[4650.90 --> 4651.90]  and that by believing
[4651.90 --> 4653.70]  you may have life
[4653.70 --> 4654.86]  in his name.
[4654.86 --> 4656.64]  These are written
[4656.64 --> 4658.48]  that you may believe
[4658.48 --> 4660.36]  that Jesus is the Messiah,
[4660.48 --> 4661.20]  the Son of God
[4661.20 --> 4662.54]  and that by believing
[4662.54 --> 4664.06]  you may have life
[4664.06 --> 4665.16]  in his name.
[4665.28 --> 4666.30]  These are written.
[4666.70 --> 4668.46]  This is the gospel,
[4668.78 --> 4668.90]  right?
[4668.96 --> 4670.28]  Because Jesus lived
[4670.28 --> 4671.58]  the life I should have lived
[4671.58 --> 4672.56]  and died the death
[4672.56 --> 4673.70]  that I deserve.
[4673.82 --> 4675.14]  Because Jesus was raised
[4675.14 --> 4676.76]  victorious over sin
[4676.76 --> 4677.20]  and death.
[4677.28 --> 4678.80]  Because the love of God
[4678.80 --> 4680.04]  for you was greater
[4680.04 --> 4681.30]  than the wrath of God
[4681.30 --> 4681.78]  for sin.
[4681.78 --> 4683.80]  because the tomb is empty.
[4683.94 --> 4685.78]  God has one life
[4685.78 --> 4688.20]  and life is given.
[4689.34 --> 4690.76]  These are written.
[4692.98 --> 4693.48]  And so now
[4693.48 --> 4695.34]  to your rootlessness,
[4696.24 --> 4697.72]  to your doubts,
[4698.00 --> 4699.00]  to your struggles,
[4699.46 --> 4701.42]  he brings a rootedness
[4701.42 --> 4704.42]  of worship and word.
[4704.42 --> 4708.36]  in an age of doubt
[4708.36 --> 4710.16]  where we live,
[4711.10 --> 4712.88]  where deconstruction
[4712.88 --> 4714.46]  is in vogue,
[4715.46 --> 4716.64]  I want to simply
[4716.64 --> 4717.56]  just ask you,
[4718.44 --> 4719.96]  will you doubt your doubts?
[4721.78 --> 4721.96]  Right?
[4721.96 --> 4722.64]  Have you ever noticed
[4722.64 --> 4724.06]  that when we struggle
[4724.06 --> 4724.76]  with faith,
[4725.32 --> 4726.14]  when we struggle
[4726.14 --> 4726.72]  to believe,
[4727.12 --> 4728.10]  we don't struggle
[4728.10 --> 4728.74]  neutrally?
[4730.20 --> 4730.72]  Right?
[4730.72 --> 4732.00]  The doubts that we have
[4732.00 --> 4733.32]  have more weight
[4733.32 --> 4734.38]  than the profession
[4734.38 --> 4734.80]  of faith
[4734.80 --> 4735.50]  that we once made.
[4736.04 --> 4737.16]  We give priority
[4737.16 --> 4738.48]  to the doubts.
[4738.60 --> 4739.60]  That's the impact
[4739.60 --> 4740.82]  of this cultural moment
[4740.82 --> 4741.34]  on us.
[4741.54 --> 4742.66]  That's what's changed.
[4743.86 --> 4744.34]  Instead,
[4745.72 --> 4747.28]  I plead with you,
[4747.98 --> 4749.14]  doubt your doubts.
[4750.32 --> 4750.44]  Right?
[4750.62 --> 4751.28]  At minimum,
[4751.40 --> 4752.20]  treat them equally.
[4753.24 --> 4753.70]  And then,
[4754.34 --> 4755.02]  notice this,
[4755.10 --> 4755.32]  then,
[4755.70 --> 4756.72]  the answer,
[4757.10 --> 4757.32]  right,
[4757.32 --> 4758.54]  to your doubts
[4758.54 --> 4761.18]  isn't going to be proofs.
[4761.88 --> 4762.00]  Right?
[4762.06 --> 4762.88]  The response
[4762.88 --> 4763.54]  to your doubt,
[4763.62 --> 4764.36]  like Thomas,
[4764.52 --> 4766.40]  needs to be worship.
[4767.84 --> 4768.06]  Right?
[4768.12 --> 4768.90]  Bring your doubts
[4768.90 --> 4769.56]  to Jesus.
[4770.16 --> 4770.90]  Bring your doubts
[4770.90 --> 4771.52]  to church.
[4773.20 --> 4774.34]  I believe.
[4774.86 --> 4776.22]  Help my unbelief.
[4777.50 --> 4778.44]  My Lord
[4778.44 --> 4780.36]  and my God.
[4782.46 --> 4783.10]  Worship
[4783.10 --> 4784.48]  with us.
[4784.48 --> 4786.26]  These are written
[4786.26 --> 4787.52]  word
[4787.52 --> 4787.58]  word.
[4788.16 --> 4788.50]  Worship
[4788.50 --> 4789.42]  brings us
[4789.42 --> 4790.48]  a rootedness.
[4790.68 --> 4791.24]  And now,
[4791.66 --> 4792.56]  these are
[4792.56 --> 4793.48]  written
[4793.48 --> 4794.78]  sacrament.
[4796.16 --> 4796.88]  In a moment,
[4797.02 --> 4797.70]  we will take
[4797.70 --> 4798.54]  Jesus in,
[4798.62 --> 4799.40]  just as he commanded
[4799.40 --> 4800.02]  us to do
[4800.02 --> 4800.70]  in John 6.
[4800.96 --> 4801.94]  We will take him
[4801.94 --> 4802.94]  in through the bread
[4802.94 --> 4803.98]  and the wine.
[4804.08 --> 4804.60]  In a moment,
[4804.70 --> 4805.44]  we will touch,
[4805.68 --> 4805.94]  taste,
[4806.08 --> 4806.56]  and see.
[4806.74 --> 4807.50]  In a moment,
[4807.62 --> 4808.20]  once again,
[4808.64 --> 4809.50]  transcendence
[4809.50 --> 4810.56]  will come crashing
[4810.56 --> 4812.04]  through to you
[4812.04 --> 4812.72]  and to me
[4812.72 --> 4814.08]  as we come
[4814.08 --> 4815.52]  to the table.
[4815.52 --> 4818.04]  the tomb
[4818.04 --> 4818.64]  is empty,
[4818.64 --> 4821.04]  so our hearts
[4821.04 --> 4822.52]  are full.
[4823.98 --> 4825.20]  Your doubts
[4825.20 --> 4826.86]  are real,
[4827.58 --> 4828.50]  but come
[4828.50 --> 4829.90]  in worship.
[4830.78 --> 4831.22]  Come
[4831.22 --> 4832.36]  to Jesus.
[4833.06 --> 4833.52]  Come
[4833.52 --> 4835.34]  to the table.
[4836.26 --> 4836.54]  Amen?
[4836.54 --> 4838.64]  Let's pray
[4838.64 --> 4839.00]  together.
[4843.80 --> 4844.66]  Lord Jesus,
[4845.62 --> 4846.66]  here we
[4846.66 --> 4847.64]  are.
[4849.96 --> 4850.82]  In the midst
[4850.82 --> 4851.30]  of doubts,
[4851.44 --> 4851.74]  in the midst
[4851.74 --> 4852.22]  of questions,
[4852.42 --> 4852.72]  in the midst
[4852.72 --> 4853.60]  of skepticism,
[4853.60 --> 4854.64]  in the midst
[4854.64 --> 4855.50]  of outright
[4855.50 --> 4856.46]  unbelief,
[4856.80 --> 4857.44]  help us
[4857.44 --> 4858.10]  to doubt
[4858.10 --> 4859.70]  our doubting.
[4859.70 --> 4862.40]  help us
[4862.40 --> 4863.08]  to bring
[4863.08 --> 4863.92]  our doubts
[4863.92 --> 4865.30]  to worship.
[4866.70 --> 4867.78]  Help us
[4867.78 --> 4868.84]  to test
[4868.84 --> 4870.00]  our doubts
[4870.00 --> 4870.96]  by worship
[4870.96 --> 4871.98]  and word
[4871.98 --> 4872.64]  and now
[4872.64 --> 4873.50]  sacrament,
[4873.72 --> 4874.52]  and so meet
[4874.52 --> 4875.22]  us
[4875.22 --> 4876.82]  with your grace.
[4878.26 --> 4879.04]  Meet us
[4879.04 --> 4880.34]  at this table,
[4880.56 --> 4880.98]  Lord Jesus,
[4881.12 --> 4881.84]  that we might
[4881.84 --> 4883.86]  taste and see
[4883.86 --> 4884.88]  that you
[4884.88 --> 4886.50]  are good,
[4886.74 --> 4887.56]  that we might
[4887.56 --> 4888.70]  taste and see
[4888.70 --> 4889.46]  that you
[4889.46 --> 4891.30]  are God.
[4892.30 --> 4893.04]  Lord Jesus,
[4893.16 --> 4893.56]  we come
[4893.56 --> 4894.40]  to this table
[4894.40 --> 4895.44]  responding
[4895.44 --> 4896.18]  to your
[4896.18 --> 4897.04]  invitation.
[4898.12 --> 4899.00]  We come
[4899.00 --> 4899.34]  and we
[4899.34 --> 4899.80]  profess,
[4900.02 --> 4900.54]  my Lord
[4900.54 --> 4902.06]  and my God.
[4902.82 --> 4903.20]  Amen.
[4912.32 --> 4913.24]  Our Lord
[4913.24 --> 4913.60]  Jesus,
[4914.70 --> 4915.88]  before he
[4915.88 --> 4916.52]  suffered,
[4917.64 --> 4918.36]  gave us
[4918.36 --> 4919.34]  this memorial
[4919.34 --> 4920.50]  of his
[4920.50 --> 4921.68]  sacrifice
[4921.68 --> 4922.36]  until he
[4922.36 --> 4922.98]  comes again.
[4924.60 --> 4925.26]  The Lord
[4925.26 --> 4925.64]  Jesus,
[4925.96 --> 4926.48]  on the night
[4926.48 --> 4927.00]  that he was
[4927.00 --> 4927.50]  betrayed,
[4928.32 --> 4929.28]  took bread
[4929.28 --> 4930.66]  and when he
[4930.66 --> 4931.14]  had given
[4931.14 --> 4931.76]  thanks,
[4932.04 --> 4932.84]  he broke
[4932.84 --> 4933.60]  it and said,
[4933.88 --> 4934.62]  this is my
[4934.62 --> 4935.06]  body,
[4935.42 --> 4936.10]  which is for
[4936.10 --> 4936.42]  you.
[4937.12 --> 4937.80]  Do this
[4937.80 --> 4938.62]  in remembrance
[4938.62 --> 4939.84]  of me.
[4941.18 --> 4941.94]  And in the
[4941.94 --> 4942.72]  same way,
[4943.16 --> 4944.14]  he took the
[4944.14 --> 4945.02]  cup after
[4945.02 --> 4945.74]  supper and
[4945.74 --> 4946.10]  said,
[4946.10 --> 4947.40]  this cup
[4947.40 --> 4948.12]  is the
[4948.12 --> 4948.70]  new covenant
[4948.70 --> 4949.72]  in my
[4949.72 --> 4950.08]  blood.
[4950.74 --> 4951.30]  Do this
[4951.30 --> 4952.06]  in remembrance
[4952.06 --> 4952.86]  of me.
[4953.60 --> 4954.24]  For whenever
[4954.24 --> 4955.18]  we eat this
[4955.18 --> 4955.86]  bread and
[4955.86 --> 4956.62]  drink this
[4956.62 --> 4957.02]  cup,
[4957.12 --> 4957.72]  we proclaim
[4957.72 --> 4958.48]  the Lord's
[4958.48 --> 4958.80]  death
[4958.80 --> 4960.20]  until he
[4960.20 --> 4961.82]  comes again.
[4963.08 --> 4963.88]  I'm going to
[4963.88 --> 4964.42]  invite you
[4964.42 --> 4965.94]  again as you
[4965.94 --> 4966.52]  are able to
[4966.52 --> 4966.94]  stand.
[4967.28 --> 4967.60]  And we are
[4967.60 --> 4968.34]  going to
[4968.34 --> 4969.80]  recite and
[4969.80 --> 4970.84]  profess our
[4970.84 --> 4971.86]  shared faith
[4971.86 --> 4972.70]  using the
[4972.70 --> 4973.34]  words of the
[4973.34 --> 4973.80]  Apostles'
[4973.80 --> 4974.16]  Creed.
[4974.32 --> 4974.64]  You will
[4974.64 --> 4975.02]  see it
[4975.02 --> 4976.04]  over my
[4976.04 --> 4976.22]  shoulder.
[4976.32 --> 4976.54]  Let's
[4976.54 --> 4976.88]  stand
[4976.88 --> 4977.64]  together.
[4980.16 --> 4980.90]  With one
[4980.90 --> 4981.34]  voice,
[4981.90 --> 4982.78]  I believe
[4982.78 --> 4983.38]  in God,
[4983.48 --> 4984.00]  the Father
[4984.00 --> 4984.64]  Almighty,
[4985.40 --> 4986.34]  creator of
[4986.34 --> 4986.96]  heaven and
[4986.96 --> 4987.28]  earth.
[4987.94 --> 4988.64]  I believe
[4988.64 --> 4989.32]  in Jesus
[4989.32 --> 4989.92]  Christ,
[4990.18 --> 4990.78]  his only
[4990.78 --> 4991.24]  son,
[4991.52 --> 4992.10]  our Lord,
[4992.82 --> 4993.36]  who was
[4993.36 --> 4994.20]  conceived by
[4994.20 --> 4994.60]  the Holy
[4994.60 --> 4995.98]  Spirit and
[4995.98 --> 4996.58]  born of
[4996.58 --> 4997.00]  the Virgin
[4997.00 --> 4997.38]  Mary.
[4998.16 --> 4998.86]  He suffered
[4998.86 --> 4999.82]  under Pontius
[4999.82 --> 5000.34]  Pilate,
[5000.92 --> 5001.70]  was crucified,
[5002.20 --> 5002.56]  died,
[5002.70 --> 5003.10]  and was
[5003.10 --> 5003.44]  buried.
[5004.08 --> 5004.80]  He descended
[5004.80 --> 5005.40]  into hell.
[5006.22 --> 5006.74]  The third
[5006.74 --> 5007.70]  day he rose
[5007.70 --> 5008.40]  again from
[5008.40 --> 5008.84]  the dead.
[5009.56 --> 5010.26]  He ascended
[5010.26 --> 5010.92]  into heaven
[5010.92 --> 5012.08]  and is seated
[5012.08 --> 5012.80]  at the right
[5012.80 --> 5013.82]  hand of God
[5013.82 --> 5014.44]  the Father
[5014.44 --> 5014.96]  Almighty.
[5015.88 --> 5016.54]  From there
[5016.54 --> 5017.26]  he will come
[5017.26 --> 5018.20]  to judge the
[5018.20 --> 5018.98]  living and
[5018.98 --> 5019.40]  the dead.
[5020.24 --> 5020.98]  I believe
[5020.98 --> 5021.68]  in the Holy
[5021.68 --> 5022.16]  Spirit,
[5022.80 --> 5023.44]  the Holy
[5023.44 --> 5024.50]  Catholic Church,
[5025.12 --> 5025.66]  the communion
[5025.66 --> 5026.46]  of saints,
[5027.20 --> 5027.78]  the forgiveness
[5027.78 --> 5028.62]  of sins,
[5029.26 --> 5030.02]  the resurrection
[5030.02 --> 5030.92]  of the body,
[5031.50 --> 5032.30]  and the life
[5032.30 --> 5032.98]  everlasting.
[5033.94 --> 5034.38]  Amen.
[5035.18 --> 5035.78]  Amen.
[5035.88 --> 5036.20]  You may be
[5036.20 --> 5036.40]  seated.
[5043.58 --> 5044.46]  In prayer,
[5044.94 --> 5045.44]  Lord,
[5045.56 --> 5046.08]  our God,
[5046.16 --> 5046.52]  by your
[5046.52 --> 5047.46]  power you
[5047.46 --> 5048.70]  raised Jesus
[5048.70 --> 5049.58]  from death
[5049.58 --> 5050.32]  to life.
[5051.46 --> 5051.98]  Through his
[5051.98 --> 5052.74]  victory over
[5052.74 --> 5053.22]  the grave,
[5053.34 --> 5054.02]  we are set

[6084.22 --> 6086.22]  It is paid in full
[6086.22 --> 6090.22]  By the precious blood
[6090.22 --> 6092.22]  That my Jesus spilled
[6092.22 --> 6094.22]  Now my debt is paid
[6094.22 --> 6096.22]  It is paid in full
[6096.22 --> 6098.22]  By the precious blood
[6098.22 --> 6100.22]  That my Jesus spilled
[6100.22 --> 6102.22]  Now the curse of sin
[6102.22 --> 6104.22]  Has no hold on me
[6104.22 --> 6106.22]  Oh, it's free indeed
[6106.22 --> 6107.22]  Oh, it's free indeed
[6107.22 --> 6110.22]  Oh, that rugged cross
[6110.22 --> 6112.22]  My salvation
[6112.22 --> 6120.22]  Where your love poured out over me
[6120.22 --> 6126.22]  Now my soul cries out, Alleluia
[6126.22 --> 6132.22]  Praise and honor all to me
[6132.22 --> 6142.22]  See the stone is rolled away
[6142.22 --> 6148.22]  Behold the empty tomb
[6148.22 --> 6150.22]  Alleluia
[6150.22 --> 6152.22]  Alleluia
[6152.22 --> 6154.22]  God be praised
[6154.22 --> 6158.22]  He's risen from the grave
[6158.22 --> 6162.22]  Oh, that rugged cross
[6162.22 --> 6164.22]  My salvation
[6164.22 --> 6166.22]  Where your love poured out over me
[6166.22 --> 6168.22]  My salvation
[6168.22 --> 6172.22]  Where your love poured out over me
[6172.22 --> 6176.22]  Now my soul cries out, Alleluia
[6176.22 --> 6180.22]  Praise and honor all to me
[6180.22 --> 6182.22]  Praise and honor all to me
[6182.22 --> 6187.40]  Praise and honor unto me
[6187.40 --> 6194.52]  Praise and honor unto me
[6212.22 --> 6239.46]  Before the throne of God above
[6239.46 --> 6244.74]  I have a strong and perfect plea
[6244.74 --> 6249.92]  The great high priest whose name is love
[6249.92 --> 6254.46]  Whoever lives and pleads for me
[6254.98 --> 6260.16]  My name is graven on his hands
[6260.16 --> 6264.46]  My name is written on his heart
[6264.46 --> 6269.46]  I know that while in heaven he stands
[6270.04 --> 6274.46]  No tongue can bid me hence depart
[6274.46 --> 6279.46]  No tongue can bid me hence depart
[6279.46 --> 6291.46]  When Satan tempts me to despair
[6292.16 --> 6297.46]  And tells me of the guilt within
[6297.46 --> 6302.66]  Upward I look and see him there
[6302.66 --> 6307.64]  Who made an end of all my sin
[6307.64 --> 6313.06]  Because the sinless Savior died
[6313.06 --> 6318.02]  My sinful soul is counted free
[6318.02 --> 6322.98]  For God the just is satisfied
[6322.98 --> 6328.10]  To look on him and pardon me
[6328.10 --> 6333.52]  To look on him and pardon me
[6333.52 --> 6345.48]  Behold him there the risen Lamb
[6345.48 --> 6350.30]  My perfect spotless righteousness
[6350.30 --> 6355.72]  The great unchangeable I am
[6355.72 --> 6360.30]  The King of glory and of grace
[6360.30 --> 6365.30]  One with himself I cannot die
[6365.30 --> 6370.30]  My soul is purchased by his blood
[6370.30 --> 6374.30]  My life is hid with Christ
[6374.30 --> 6376.22]  My life is hid with Christ on high
[6376.22 --> 6381.30]  With Christ my Savior and my God
[6381.30 --> 6386.36]  With Christ my Savior and my God
[6386.36 --> 6391.64]  One with himself I cannot die
[6391.64 --> 6397.06]  My soul is purchased by his blood
[6397.06 --> 6402.02]  My life is hid with Christ on high
[6402.02 --> 6407.64]  With Christ my Savior and my God
[6407.64 --> 6413.64]  With Christ my Savior and my God
[6413.64 --> 6415.64]  He is coming on the cliffs
[6415.64 --> 6417.32]  He is coming on the cliffs
[6417.32 --> 6442.38]  It's coming on the clouds
[6442.38 --> 6447.46]  Kings and kingdoms will bow down
[6447.46 --> 6453.66]  And every chain will break
[6453.66 --> 6458.26]  As broken hearts declare His praise
[6458.26 --> 6462.52]  For who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[6463.44 --> 6469.90]  Our God is a lion, the lion to him
[6469.90 --> 6475.90]  He's roaring with power and fighting our battles
[6475.90 --> 6480.84]  And every evil bow before Him
[6480.84 --> 6487.16]  Our God is a lamb, the lamb that was slain
[6487.16 --> 6493.06]  For the sins of the world, His blood breaks the chains
[6493.06 --> 6498.98]  And every evil bow before the lion and the lamb
[6498.98 --> 6504.98]  Every evil bow before Him
[6504.98 --> 6521.98]  So open up the gates and wait before the King of kings
[6521.98 --> 6527.98]  The God who comes to save
[6527.98 --> 6533.98]  Who's near to set the captives free?
[6533.98 --> 6537.98]  For who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[6537.98 --> 6543.98]  Our God is a lion, the lion to him
[6543.98 --> 6549.98]  He's roaring with power and fighting our battles
[6549.98 --> 6555.98]  And every evil bow before Him
[6555.98 --> 6560.98]  Our God is a lamb, the lamb that was slain
[6560.98 --> 6566.98]  For the sins of the world, His blood breaks the chains
[6566.98 --> 6568.98]  And every evil bow before Him
[6568.98 --> 6572.98]  And every evil bow before Him
[6572.98 --> 6578.98]  And every evil bow before Him
[6578.98 --> 6588.98]  Who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[6588.98 --> 6595.98]  Who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[6595.98 --> 6599.88]  Who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[6601.62 --> 6605.62]  Who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[6607.54 --> 6609.86]  Who can stop the Lord?
[6613.00 --> 6618.16]  Our God is a lion, the Lion of Judah.
[6618.16 --> 6624.22]  He's roaring with power and fighting our battles.
[6624.22 --> 6628.98]  And every knee will bow before Him.
[6629.68 --> 6635.16]  Our God is a lamb, the lamb that was slain.
[6635.64 --> 6641.10]  For the sins of the world, His blood breaks the chains.
[6641.72 --> 6646.14]  And every knee will bow before the Lion of Judah.
[6646.14 --> 6651.98]  And every knee will bow before Him.
[6654.22 --> 6658.20]  The Lion of Judah
[6658.20 --> 6667.02]  Where we ain't and by the Holy Geb
[6667.02 --> 6670.38]  And every knee will bow before Him.
[6670.38 --> 6700.36]  Thank you.
[6700.38 --> 6730.36]  Thank you.
[6730.38 --> 6732.38]  Thank you.
[6760.38 --> 6762.38]  Thank you.
[6790.38 --> 6792.38]  Thank you.
[6792.38 --> 6794.38]  Thank you.
[6822.38 --> 6824.38]  Thank you.
[6824.38 --> 6826.38]  Thank you.
[6826.38 --> 6828.38]  Thank you.
[6856.38 --> 6858.38]  Thank you.
[6886.38 --> 6888.38]  Thank you.
[6888.38 --> 6890.38]  Thank you.
[6890.38 --> 6892.38]  Thank you.
[6892.38 --> 6894.38]  Thank you.
[6894.38 --> 6896.38]  Thank you.
[6924.38 --> 6926.38]  Thank you.
[6926.38 --> 6930.38]  Praise the Father.
[6930.38 --> 6932.38]  Praise the Son.
[6932.38 --> 6936.38]  Praise the Spirit.
[6936.38 --> 6940.38]  Three in one.
[6940.38 --> 6946.38]  God of glory, majesty.
[6946.38 --> 6954.38]  Praise forever to the King of Kings.
[6954.38 --> 6964.38]  Praise forever to the King of Kings.
[6964.38 --> 6966.38]  Amen.
[6966.38 --> 6968.38]  Amen.
[6968.38 --> 6970.38]  Amen.
[6970.38 --> 6972.38]  Amen.
[6972.38 --> 6980.38]  As we go into this week, go, I pray, nourished by worship, word, and sacrament.
[6980.38 --> 6984.38]  Go this week with your faith strengthened.
[6984.38 --> 6996.38]  Go this week doubting your doubts to know with certainty that the tomb is empty, that our Lord Jesus Christ is raised, and that he goes with you.
[6996.38 --> 7002.38]  Go also with an invitation to stick around afterwards for a time of fellowship and celebrating together.
[7002.38 --> 7012.38]  As well, during children's worship time, the kids were in the multipurpose room painting the windows in stained glass style and shape.
[7012.38 --> 7022.38]  And so as you exit and drive out the way, you might see that and encourage you to go look at that as well from the outside.
[7022.38 --> 7024.38]  Because it's not as cool from the inside.
[7024.38 --> 7026.38]  So I was told.
[7026.38 --> 7034.38]  Also, if you would like to connect with me following worship and discuss whichever or ask your questions, I will be at the Connect booth.
[7034.38 --> 7036.38]  You can grab me there.
[7036.38 --> 7039.38]  Receive the blessing of God as we go.
[7042.38 --> 7046.38]  May God go before you to lead you.
[7046.38 --> 7049.38]  May God go behind you to guard you.
[7049.38 --> 7053.38]  May God go beneath you to uphold you.
[7053.38 --> 7056.38]  And may God go beside you to befriend you.
[7056.38 --> 7059.38]  Do not be afraid.
[7059.38 --> 7062.38]  But let the blessing of God come upon you today.
[7062.38 --> 7064.38]  Do not be afraid.
[7064.38 --> 7070.38]  But go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
[7070.38 --> 7072.38]  Amen.
[7072.38 --> 7089.38]  May God go beside you.
[7089.38 --> 7093.38]  May God bless you.
[7093.38 --> 7097.38]  May God bless you.
[7097.38 --> 7108.52]  There is our Redeemer, Jesus, God's old Son.
[7108.52 --> 7119.98]  Precious Lamb of God, Messiah, O Holy One.
[7119.98 --> 7132.82]  Thank you, O my Father, for giving us your Son.
[7132.82 --> 7144.24]  And leading your Spirit to the work of earthly Son.
[7144.24 --> 7157.36]  Jesus, my Redeemer, Name above all names.
[7157.36 --> 7168.16]  Precious Lamb of God, Messiah, O for sinners' sake.
[7168.16 --> 7180.40]  Thank you, O my Father, for giving us your Son.
[7181.52 --> 7192.16]  And leading your Spirit till the work on earth is done.
[7192.16 --> 7206.56]  When I stand in glory, I will see His face.
[7206.56 --> 7218.62]  There I'll serve my King forever in that holy place.
[7218.62 --> 7230.94]  Thank you, O my Father, for giving us your Son.
[7230.94 --> 7242.52]  And leading your Spirit till the work on earth is done.
[7242.52 --> 7255.02]  Thank you, O my Father, for giving us your Son.
[7255.02 --> 7269.24]  And leading your Spirit till the work on earth is done.
[7272.52 --> 7274.52]  I then shall live as one who's God.
[7274.52 --> 7277.52]  I then shall live as one who's God.
[7277.52 --> 7281.52]  I then shall live as one who's God.
[7281.52 --> 7291.52]  I then shall live as one who's been forgiven.
[7291.52 --> 7304.84]  I then shall live as one who's been forgiven.
[7304.84 --> 7316.84]  I'll walk with joy to know my debts are paid.
[7316.84 --> 7326.84]  I know my name is clear before my Father.
[7326.84 --> 7328.84]  I am His Father.
[7328.84 --> 7332.84]  I am His child.
[7332.84 --> 7338.84]  And I am not afraid.
[7338.84 --> 7343.84]  So greatly pardoned.
[7343.84 --> 7348.84]  And I'll forgive my brother.
[7348.84 --> 7350.84]  The law of love.
[7350.84 --> 7360.84]  The law of love I gladly will obey.
[7360.84 --> 7368.84]  I then shall live as one who's learned compassion.
[7368.84 --> 7389.84]  compassion. I've been so loved that I'll risk loving too. I know how fear builds walls instead
[7389.84 --> 7412.98]  of bridges. I'll dare to see another's point of view. And when relationships demand commitment,
[7412.98 --> 7434.98]  then I'll be there to care and follow through. Your kingdom come around and through and in me.
[7434.98 --> 7456.98]  Your power and glory let them shine through me. Your hallowed name, O may I bear with honor.
[7456.98 --> 7478.36]  And may your giving kingdom come in me. The bread of life, O may I share with honor.
[7478.36 --> 7489.78]  And may you feed a hungry world through me.
