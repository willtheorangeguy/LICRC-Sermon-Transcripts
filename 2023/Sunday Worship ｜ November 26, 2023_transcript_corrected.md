[48.22 → 51.98] I'm just trying to understand.
[51.98 → 55.48] Is there some master plan?
[55.48 → 60.48] Because I've got so many questions.
[60.48 → 64.76] Am I, am I the only one?
[64.76 → 67.48] Is like this ladder's missing rocks?
[67.48 → 73.48] Because I can't find a way to climb it.
[73.48 → 89.40] Step it out onto the water.
[89.40 → 93.40] I'm not sure if you'll sink or stand.
[93.40 → 95.40] I think fear's pretty normal.

[102.40 → 105.40] Is to walk by faith, not sigh.
[105.40 → 108.40] We all get scared, or we don't know.
[108.40 → 111.40] But maybe that's alright.
[111.40 → 114.40] Faith is like a free fall sometimes.
[118.40 → 121.40] I guess I still freak out sometimes.
[124.40 → 127.40] Your faith is like a free fall sometimes.

[502.56 → 515.00] Thank you.
[532.56 → 562.54] Thank you.
[562.56 → 592.54] Thank you.
[592.54 → 593.32] My name is Chris.
[593.52 → 599.00] I'm one of the pastors here at Emanuel, and it's my privilege, along with these others
[599.00 → 604.08] and a few who you don't yet see, to lead in our shared worship together this morning.
[604.38 → 612.62] Before we begin, there are a couple of people, and I'm going to invite Linda and Clem, and
[612.62 → 615.62] we're going to be here to talk to you.
[615.62 → 624.16] And as they're making their way up, I just want to remind you to talk to you, and I'm going
[624.16 → 627.16] and I'm going to be here to talk to you.
[627.16 → 627.24] And so if you have any questions about that, you can talk to Pastor Kevin.
[627.24 → 629.16] He will gladly answer them.
[629.16 → 629.96] Go ahead.
[629.96 → 639.12] We're going to have a few of the lessons since Worthy, and we're going to say you're going to do this morning, if we've got Oneonta Boyle of up?
[639.12 → 645.02] 630. We are encouraged to bring an appetizer or a dessert. We're looking forward to this
[645.02 → 650.58] wonderful evening on fellowship. If you haven't signed up, you have an opportunity after church
[650.58 → 656.90] to sign up at the booth in the back, or you can email on the church bulletin. The deadline
[656.90 → 663.56] to sign up is tomorrow. We have a tiny problem. It's a wonderful problem. We have 119 women
[663.56 → 668.64] signed up for this event, so it's going to be a fabulous evening. With that being said,
[668.64 → 675.68] we might need one or two more table setters. If you would like to be a backup, just in
[675.68 → 681.88] case we have an influx of registrations, let me know or meet us at the table at the back.
[682.34 → 689.48] For those who are setting up tables, you have an opportunity to come on Thursday between
[689.48 → 695.82] 7 and 9 p.m., or we will also be here Friday morning between 10 and 1. If you have any questions,
[695.82 → 701.40] by all means catch one of us, catch me or one of us in the back at the end of the day.
[701.66 → 701.96] Thanks.
[706.52 → 707.22] Good morning.
[707.22 → 716.58] Some of you may know Dina Nicolai. She is a chaplain and refugee support mobilizer with
[716.58 → 727.42] CRCs of BC. She's actually helping us with our refugee sponsorship program right now and
[727.42 → 735.76] facilitating some of that stuff. She also runs a clothing bank at First CRC, Vancouver, and
[735.76 → 744.46] there are many refugees in that area. And so this year they're running out of clothing and
[744.46 → 754.90] warm stuff. So she's put out a plea for some items. They're asking for used winter coats and
[754.90 → 763.60] jackets and rain jackets, all sizes, warm sweaters, adults only, gloves and mittens, all sizes,
[763.60 → 773.60] socks, all sizes, umbrellas, and scarves. New is an option. So I'm going to try and get it into the
[773.60 → 781.84] midweek memo and next Sunday. If you could bring it next Sunday, that would be great. Thank you.
[781.84 → 786.80] Thanks, Clem.
[787.54 → 789.36] Just one last announcement.
[790.54 → 797.24] At the first Saturday of every month, we send a team over to Sun ridge Gardens up the hill,
[797.36 → 804.02] which is a seniors and retirement living complex, and we lead an hour worship time together.
[804.02 → 809.84] That's coming up this Saturday on December 2nd, and it's going to be our Christmas worship time
[809.84 → 815.80] and celebration. And so we want to encourage you, if you have the opportunity to come and join us at
[815.80 → 820.96] 2 p.m. on Sun ridge for Christmas worship, we can connect with some of the people who live there,
[821.72 → 827.68] share in song and story together. And so if you have questions about that, you can grab me after the
[827.68 → 834.90] service or Leslie Kohl, and she will explain some of that as well. I think that's it for now. So let's
[834.90 → 841.38] stand together, if you are able, and we can be ushered into the presence of God in our worship.
[843.52 → 852.62] Receive then God's greeting. Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus
[852.62 → 859.24] Christ, Son, and our Saviour, through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[860.00 → 864.72] I'm going to invite you to turn to those around you and welcome them as guests in our worship this morning.
[882.62 → 904.34] In Psalm 103 we read, Praise the Lord my soul, all my inmost beings, praise his holy name.
[905.62 → 912.30] Psalm 63 says, Because your love is better than life, my lips will glorify you.
[912.62 → 918.76] I will praise you as long as I live, and in your name I will lift my hands.
[918.76 → 945.76] Praise the Lord my soul, the King of heaven, to his feet your tribute bring.
[945.76 → 955.76] Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven, evermore his praises sing.
[956.76 → 967.76] Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise the everlasting King.
[967.76 → 980.76] Praise him for his grace and favour to his people in distress.
[980.76 → 991.64] Praise him still the same as ever, slow to chide and swift to bless.
[991.64 → 1002.64] Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, for us in his faithfulness.
[1002.64 → 1009.64] Father, my King, he tempts and says,
[1009.64 → 1015.86] Well, our feet, oh, pray, he knows.
[1015.86 → 1020.64] In his hands he gently bears us,
[1020.64 → 1025.64] Rescues us from all our foes.
[1025.64 → 1037.64] Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, why we yet his mercy rose.
[1037.64 → 1046.64] Angels, help us to adore him.
[1046.64 → 1051.64] You behold him face to face.
[1051.64 → 1057.64] Sun and moon bow down, we bore him.
[1057.64 → 1062.64] Dwellers all in time and space.
[1062.64 → 1075.64] Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise with us the God of grace.

[1352.86 → 1357.86] You can have a seat.
[1357.86 → 1362.86] Those two songs, praise my soul, the king of heaven, and here are praises that we just sang.
[1362.86 → 1364.86] Focus on praise.
[1364.86 → 1369.86] In Hebrews 13, verse 15, it says,
[1369.86 → 1376.86] The terms sacrifice and praise might seem to be opposites.
[1376.86 → 1383.86] But as a Jesus follower, sacrifice and praise are intertwined in our lives.
[1383.86 → 1390.86] To praise God during difficult times requires us to let go and trust God, no matter what the future holds.
[1390.86 → 1397.86] God also accepts our praise even though we are sinful.
[1397.86 → 1410.86] Psalm 51, verses 16 to 17 talks about this when it says,
[1410.86 → 1411.86] When it says,
[1411.86 → 1415.86] You do not delight in sacrifice, or I would bring it.
[1415.86 → 1419.86] You do not take pleasure in burnt offerings.
[1419.86 → 1423.86] My sacrifice, O God, is a contrite spirit.
[1423.86 → 1429.86] A broken and contrite heart you, God, will not despise.
[1429.86 → 1436.86] Let us take a few moments this morning to offer our contrite hearts to God in silent prayer.
[1436.86 → 1437.86] Amen.

[1520.86 → 1536.86] All I have within me, I give you praise.
[1536.86 → 1548.86] All that I adore is in you.
[1548.86 → 1558.10] Lord, I give you my heart.
[1558.52 → 1561.86] I give you my soul.
[1561.86 → 1568.02] I live for you alone.
[1568.52 → 1571.86] Every breath that I take.
[1572.48 → 1576.00] Every moment I'm awake.
[1577.74 → 1580.72] I'm back your way.
[1580.72 → 1598.72] This is my desire to honour you.
[1598.72 → 1608.72] Lord, with all my heart I worship you.
[1608.72 → 1626.72] All I have within me, I give you praise.
[1626.72 → 1636.72] All that I adore is in you.
[1636.72 → 1645.72] Lord, I give you my heart.
[1645.72 → 1649.72] I give you my soul.
[1649.72 → 1655.72] I live for you alone.
[1655.72 → 1658.72] Every breath that I take.
[1658.72 → 1662.72] And all that I'm awake.
[1662.72 → 1664.72] I live for you alone.
[1664.72 → 1669.72] I live for you alone.
[1669.72 → 1672.72] Lord, I give you my heart.
[1672.72 → 1673.72] I give you my heart.
[1673.72 → 1676.72] I give you my soul.
[1676.72 → 1682.72] I live for you alone.
[1682.72 → 1685.72] Every breath that I take.
[1685.72 → 1687.72] Every breath that I pipe.
[1687.72 → 1691.18] Next and Casey, the Lord is at my word.
[1691.18 → 1694.14] Every breath that I work.
[1694.14 → 1699.54] Every breath that I do.
[1699.54 → 1701.14] Every rest is a Force out of interest.
[1701.14 → 1704.14] And the heart I need you out of interest.
[1704.52 → 1707.14] However, all that I do ISRO into.
[1707.14 → 1711.14] God's word will respond to you.
[1712.14 → 1714.18] But the mother I may continue to condemn you by
[1714.18 → 1715.14] including all of us foodと思います.
[1715.14 → 1722.06] Hear these assuring words that we read from Isaiah 44, verses 22 to 23.
[1723.20 → 1724.84] I have made you.
[1725.40 → 1727.12] You are my servant.
[1728.02 → 1729.86] Israel, I will not forget you.
[1730.66 → 1736.42] I have swept away your offences like a cloud, your sins like the morning mist.
[1737.46 → 1740.64] Return to me, for I have redeemed you.
[1741.50 → 1745.10] Sing for joy, you heavens, for the Lord has done this.
[1745.56 → 1747.72] Shout aloud, you earth beneath.
[1748.20 → 1750.32] Burst into song, you mountains.
[1750.98 → 1755.00] You forest and all your trees, for the Lord has redeemed Jacob.
[1755.00 → 1758.36] He displays his glory in Israel.
[1770.64 → 1797.66] The sin of man and wrath of God has been on Jesus' name.
[1797.66 → 1814.80] Silent as he stood, accused, beaten on and scored.
[1814.80 → 1827.80] Flowing to the Father's den, he took the crown of gold.
[1827.80 → 1841.90] Oh, that rugged cross, my salvation, where your love poured out over me.
[1842.44 → 1854.84] Now my soul cries out, Alleluia, praise and honour unto thee.
[1854.84 → 1884.82] Lord has redeemed you.
[1884.84 → 1897.84] All the rugged cross, my salvation, where your love poured out over me.
[1897.84 → 1910.60] Now my soul cries out, Alleluia, praise and honour unto thee.
[1910.60 → 1921.88] Now my death is great, it is great in full.
[1921.88 → 1928.78] By the precious blood that my Jesus filled.
[1928.78 → 1929.78] Now the curse of sin.
[1929.78 → 1931.78] Now the curse of sin.
[1931.78 → 1932.10] Now the curse of sin.
[1932.10 → 1935.46] Has no hold on thee.
[1935.46 → 1938.62] Whom the Son sets free.
[1938.62 → 1941.78] Oh, it's free indeed.
[1941.78 → 1942.78] Now the curse of sin.
[1942.78 → 1944.78] Now the curse of sin.
[1944.78 → 1948.78] Now the curse of sin.
[1948.78 → 1949.78] Has no hold on thee.
[1949.78 → 1959.78] Now the curse of sin.

[1982.66 → 1983.78] oh

[2007.32 → 2009.08] tomb
[2009.08 → 2011.78] Hallelujah
[2012.54 → 2013.78] God
[2014.70 → 2015.32] he
[2015.32 → 2015.78] raised
[2016.30 → 2017.78] he raised
[2017.78 → 2019.44] him from
[2019.44 → 2021.44] the grave
[2022.30 → 2023.28] for the
[2023.28 → 2024.82] love is
[2024.82 → 2025.36] lost
[2025.36 → 2027.44] my salvation
[2028.08 → 2029.60] where your
[2029.60 → 2031.64] love poured out
[2031.64 → 2033.44] over me
[2034.66 → 2035.82] now my
[2035.82 → 2036.62] soul
[2036.62 → 2037.92] dies out
[2037.92 → 2039.44] Hallelujah
[2039.44 → 2043.12] praise and honour
[2043.12 → 2045.18] love to
[2045.18 → 2046.44] me
[2046.44 → 2048.56] praise and
[2048.56 → 2049.68] daughter
[2049.68 → 2052.56] back to me

[2093.02 → 2095.56] Amen
[2099.56 → 2100.52] see you
[2100.52 → 2103.64] without hope without light
[2103.64 → 2110.68] till from heaven you came right there was mercy in your eyes
[2110.68 → 2115.64] to fulfill the law and promise to a virgin
[2115.64 → 2140.12] in the world
[2140.12 → 2143.60] Three and one
[2143.60 → 2147.14] God of glory
[2147.14 → 2149.48] Majesty

[2153.36 → 2155.70] To the King
[2155.70 → 2157.12] Amen
[2157.12 → 2164.36] To reveal the kingdom
[2164.36 → 2168.78] And to exile us
[2168.78 → 2171.98] To redeem the whole creation
[2171.98 → 2175.68] You did not despise the cross
[2175.68 → 2178.68] For even in your son
[2178.68 → 2182.44] You saw to the other side
[2182.44 → 2185.54] Knowing this was our salvation
[2185.54 → 2189.52] Jesus for us if you died
[2189.52 → 2198.20] Praise the Father
[2198.20 → 2201.40] Praise the Son
[2201.40 → 2205.10] Praise the Spirit

[2218.90 → 2220.20] To the King
[2220.20 → 2221.20] Of kings
[2221.20 → 2229.90] In the morning that you rose
[2229.90 → 2233.54] All heaven held its breath
[2233.54 → 2236.20] To let someone's move forward
[2236.20 → 2239.90] For the lamb had conquered death
[2239.90 → 2243.10] And the dead rose from their tomb
[2243.10 → 2246.80] And the angels stood in awe
[2246.80 → 2249.80] For the souls of all who crown
[2249.80 → 2253.80] To the Father of his soul
[2253.80 → 2256.80] And the church of Christ was born
[2256.80 → 2259.80] And the spirit of faith
[2259.80 → 2263.00] Now this gospel through the hope
[2263.00 → 2266.70] Shall all the healing shall not fade
[2266.70 → 2269.70] By the blood in his name
[2269.70 → 2273.70] With his freedom I am free
[2273.70 → 2277.00] For the love of Jesus Christ
[2277.00 → 2280.70] Who has regimented me
[2280.70 → 2289.60] Praise the Father
[2289.60 → 2292.60] Praise the Son

[2308.16 → 2309.54] Praise the Holy
[2309.54 → 2310.54] Praise the Son

[2311.16 → 2320.80] Praise the
[2324.80 → 2325.44] Praise the Holy
[2325.44 → 2326.40] gauge of glory
[2326.40 → 2326.90] Letter name
[2326.90 → 2341.90] God of glory, majesty, praise forever to the King of kings.
[2341.90 → 2350.90] Praise forever to the King of kings.
[2356.90 → 2376.90] Hello once again.
[2376.90 → 2380.90] Okay, the first offering is for the ministry of missions of our church.
[2380.90 → 2384.90] Special offering this morning is for Wagner Hills.
[2384.90 → 2394.90] It's a one-year recovery program that offers healing, growth, and transformation to men and women on the road to recovery.
[2394.90 → 2398.90] Wagner Hills has been doing this for over 40 years now.
[2398.90 → 2404.90] They have classes, guest speakers, chapel, and group sessions.
[2404.90 → 2412.90] They have personal counselling and personal plans for each individual.
[2412.90 → 2420.90] They are setting people up for a new life, a sober life.
[2420.90 → 2428.90] Addiction can be a baffling thing to most of us, but it's a pretty complicated thing.
[2428.90 → 2430.90] James 5, 15.
[2430.90 → 2435.90] And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well.
[2435.90 → 2438.90] If they have sinned, they will be forgiven.
[2438.90 → 2440.90] Thank you.
[2440.90 → 2441.90] Amen.
[2441.90 → 2442.90] Amen.
[2442.90 → 2443.90] Amen.
[2443.90 → 2444.90] Amen.
[2444.90 → 2445.90] Amen.
[2445.90 → 2447.90] Amen.
[2475.90 → 2477.90] Amen.
[2505.90 → 2507.90] Amen.
[2535.90 → 2537.90] Amen.
[2565.90 → 2567.90] Amen.
[2595.90 → 2597.90] Amen.
[2625.90 → 2627.90] Amen.
[2627.90 → 2629.90] Amen.
[2629.90 → 2631.90] Amen.
[2631.90 → 2633.90] Amen.
[2633.90 → 2635.90] Amen.
[2643.90 → 2645.90] Did you guys hear that? Whoa.
[2645.90 → 2647.90] Did you guys hear that?
[2647.90 → 2649.90] Come on up for Kids' Corner.
[2649.90 → 2651.90] You could barely hear it.
[2651.90 → 2653.90] Barely hear it.
[2653.90 → 2655.90] Barely hear it.
[2655.90 → 2658.98] It's a risky thing to be the bullhorn.
[2662.30 → 2663.76] Thanks, Pastor Kevin.
[2664.32 → 2665.68] Did that get your guys' attention?
[2666.88 → 2667.56] Kind of.
[2667.72 → 2674.96] Maybe the awkwardness got your attention more so than the delivery of the hat and the sign.
[2674.96 → 2679.86] We had all kinds of ideas that we thought we'd better not do it because it could get a little out of hand.
[2680.48 → 2680.64] Huh?
[2681.00 → 2683.30] What gets your guys' attention sometimes?
[2683.30 → 2684.50] I didn't see that.
[2685.28 → 2685.94] You did.
[2686.06 → 2686.70] Yeah, you saw it.
[2686.82 → 2688.88] Did you sometimes see bullhorns get used?
[2688.92 → 2689.86] Does that get your attention?
[2690.72 → 2690.90] Yeah.
[2690.94 → 2692.00] What about big signs?
[2693.32 → 2695.96] What do stores do if they want to get your attention?
[2696.82 → 2697.62] What do stores do?
[2697.96 → 2699.28] They look at the self-assurance.
[2699.52 → 2702.42] Huge signs that are like colourful and crazy.
[2705.30 → 2705.74] Yeah.
[2705.88 → 2707.48] They have speakers or big commercials.
[2707.86 → 2712.02] What about like an ambulance or like a fire truck?
[2712.02 → 2713.70] What do they do to get your attention?
[2715.20 → 2716.34] They have sirens.
[2717.06 → 2719.14] What colour are fire trucks usually?
[2719.98 → 2720.46] Red.
[2720.82 → 2722.64] They're red so you can really see them.
[2723.02 → 2729.54] What about, what does your teacher do if she wants, or he wants to get your attention?
[2729.54 → 2731.34] They ring a bell.
[2731.86 → 2733.48] Oh, they ring a bell.
[2733.60 → 2733.78] Yep.
[2734.30 → 2735.12] They ring a bell.
[2735.50 → 2736.40] They ring a bell.
[2737.00 → 2738.72] Oh, they command you.
[2738.72 → 2739.90] They ask you to be quiet.
[2743.46 → 2745.00] Oh, they ask you to work.
[2745.36 → 2747.76] What about, what else gets your attention?
[2747.90 → 2749.28] What about like a telephone?
[2749.44 → 2750.70] What does it do to get your attention?
[2752.78 → 2753.66] What do you think, Emma?
[2753.98 → 2754.82] It rings.
[2755.18 → 2756.48] That's pretty, that's pretty simple.
[2756.82 → 2761.18] What about when your dog or your cat wants to get your attention?
[2761.18 → 2762.42] What does it do?
[2764.54 → 2767.40] They meow or, or bark.
[2767.58 → 2769.22] What about, you know what our dog does?
[2769.82 → 2770.92] It like stares at me.
[2771.76 → 2773.06] And then like paws at me.
[2773.90 → 2774.46] Doesn't bark.
[2777.10 → 2777.68] Woof, woof.
[2777.74 → 2777.88] Yeah.
[2778.12 → 2780.52] What about, what do you guys do?
[2780.98 → 2782.76] Sometimes feel a bit of attention.
[2783.40 → 2788.18] What if, have you guys done anything creative to get your parents' attention, your mom or dad's attention?
[2788.18 → 2792.86] Where's your mom or dad, are they busy talking, or they're busy shopping, or they're busy doing chores?
[2793.12 → 2794.52] What do you guys do to get their attention?
[2798.86 → 2800.38] Oh, you're just nice to put your back.
[2801.46 → 2801.78] Exemplary.
[2802.28 → 2803.00] What about you, Levi?
[2805.80 → 2807.42] You just say, mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy.
[2807.42 → 2808.98] You just say, mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy.
[2809.54 → 2810.56] What do you do, Malachi?
[2811.76 → 2812.74] You give a hug.
[2812.80 → 2813.46] That's brilliant.
[2814.36 → 2815.04] What do you do?
[2816.64 → 2817.96] Daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy.
[2818.18 → 2820.60] You know what I used to do to my mom or dad?
[2820.76 → 2821.70] They wouldn't respond.
[2821.80 → 2823.22] They'd be like, mom, mom, mom, dad, dad, dad.
[2823.28 → 2824.32] Which is me, but a little rude.
[2824.42 → 2825.80] I was trying to interrupt you now.
[2826.18 → 2828.58] And then finally, I would say their first name.
[2829.70 → 2830.02] Jerry.
[2831.26 → 2831.58] Peter.
[2832.58 → 2834.16] And then all of a sudden, they look at me.
[2835.06 → 2836.16] They didn't usually like that, though.
[2836.58 → 2838.50] So, it's maybe the wrong kind of attention.
[2840.42 → 2847.30] Anyway, we're going to talk more in Joseph's Worship Time today about different ways God gets our attention.
[2847.30 → 2850.72] And now he uses creative ways to get our attention.
[2850.92 → 2852.32] Maybe it's a bullhorn.
[2852.42 → 2853.32] Maybe it's a silly hat.
[2853.62 → 2854.72] Maybe it's a big sign.
[2854.90 → 2856.20] But maybe there's some other cool things.
[2856.64 → 2857.28] And you know what else?
[2858.24 → 2863.76] Getting someone's attention doesn't always mean yelling and red signs and sirens and noises.
[2863.76 → 2866.32] There are other creative things that God has done, right?
[2867.06 → 2869.86] For instance, look at this beautiful flower.
[2870.88 → 2872.68] Is it a little bit obnoxious?
[2873.56 → 2873.82] No.
[2874.40 → 2875.18] Not at all.
[2875.32 → 2879.46] It's so little and beautiful and colourful and smells nice.
[2883.38 → 2884.50] Yes, exactly.
[2884.64 → 2885.84] It gives attention to itself.
[2885.84 → 2890.62] So, we're going to talk about the big ways God gets our attention and the little ways God gets our attention.
[2891.06 → 2894.76] But first, let's do the children's blessing with our church family.
[2894.94 → 2895.74] Let's stand together.
[2896.42 → 2897.46] We'll put up our hands.
[2898.86 → 2900.28] And together, we will say,
[2901.02 → 2902.58] The Lord be with you.
[2903.12 → 2904.38] And also with you.
[2904.56 → 2904.80] All right.
[2904.90 → 2906.08] See you in children's worship time.
[2906.08 → 2936.06] All right.
[2936.08 → 2937.00] Hi there.
[2937.10 → 2938.42] I'm Eric, an elder here at Emmanuel.
[2939.32 → 2942.06] Just before I bring us to our word of the family prayer this morning,
[2942.18 → 2946.20] just to highlight a couple of things in the prayer and things upcoming this week.
[2946.62 → 2952.52] First thing I wanted to highlight was this week, Wednesday of the 29th, we have our general meeting.
[2953.00 → 2955.80] More importantly, we also have our 6 p.m. start.
[2956.00 → 2957.70] That's going to be our trisomy challenge.
[2958.02 → 2963.42] First of hopefully an annual event where we challenge everyone to bring their tastiest soup
[2963.42 → 2966.10] and award the top soups in the church.
[2966.10 → 2972.96] So we're hoping to see a great turnout on the 29th here for both the general meeting and the trisomy challenge.
[2972.96 → 2978.36] This week, we learned a few different things of a few different people.
[2978.52 → 2980.30] Dennis Colin here, a member of our congregation.
[2980.56 → 2985.70] He's been in the hospital with his due diagnosis of diabetes and a few other issues they're working with.
[2986.52 → 2990.22] Former member here of the congregation, father to Ivan Grass, John Grass.
[2990.22 → 2998.78] He's continuing to deal with the prognosis of cancer and other ailments that continue to go on more testing.
[2999.50 → 3006.72] Teen even, mother to Brenda, Linda and Jody, has moved into palliative care here in Langley Hospice.
[3007.76 → 3014.00] This week, Lena Cheka, brother Frank, passed away this week in Ontario.
[3014.86 → 3017.86] So we bring that to your attention.
[3017.86 → 3026.98] Rose Vida, a neighbour and friend, Shonda, was dealing with cancer, has also passed away this week as well.
[3029.22 → 3034.70] Jerry Jansen, granddaughter Christina, had the diagnosis this week of lupus.
[3035.36 → 3040.36] And we continue to pray for further tests and results to try to figure out how to deal with that.
[3040.36 → 3049.90] But this past week, earlier as well, we had Judy Oversteer's daughter-in-law, Nicole, has been dealing with a very serious infection.
[3050.46 → 3053.54] So we continue for healing and comfort there.
[3055.38 → 3059.86] Also this week, there were quite a few funerals.
[3059.86 → 3068.26] The past week, Rob Alchemy, niece Lindsay, was late to rest as well in Ontario, and others.
[3068.40 → 3070.14] But let's turn to our Lord in prayer.
[3070.14 → 3077.62] Praise be to God and Father, our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort,
[3077.92 → 3085.64] who comforts us in our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any troubles with the comfort we ourselves receive from God.
[3087.12 → 3091.50] Praise you, Lord, earlier this week that Tall Adeel became a Canadian citizen.
[3091.50 → 3098.78] This week, we also learned that Dennis Coleman has been in the hospital, being treated for his diagnosis and other issues.
[3099.30 → 3102.42] Please comfort him in all the circumstances in his life.
[3103.70 → 3109.24] This week, Judy Oversteer's daughter-in-law, Nicole, receiving treatment for a very serious infection,
[3109.62 → 3115.64] blessed the entire family, the extended family, and blessed the doctors and the nurses in all their work.
[3115.64 → 3122.06] We're also learning with John Crassus' continued ongoing diagnosis and medical testing.
[3122.82 → 3127.38] Pray for God's rest and healing and comfort for the entire family.
[3128.52 → 3133.42] Also this week, for SY Kisser, as well as he continues to be in the hospital in Abbotsford,
[3133.98 → 3137.46] and continues ongoing medical testing as his cancer has come back.
[3138.04 → 3144.02] As doctors continue to figure out the best treatment options, bless him and his family on this journey.
[3145.64 → 3152.96] We also pray today for Christina, who has been diagnosed with lupus and continues to go through additional testing.
[3153.32 → 3155.80] Pray for comfort in the entire family at this time.
[3157.06 → 3161.48] We pray for Weenie Breed as she has entered palliative care at Langley Hospice,
[3161.98 → 3164.40] and comfort her and the entire family at this time.
[3166.04 → 3170.42] This week, we also learned about the sudden passing of Lena Check man's brother, Frank.
[3170.42 → 3176.78] Bless the family as they plan a service for this week in Ontario, and bless them in this time.
[3177.34 → 3180.88] Also this week, Shonda passed away from her battle with cancer.
[3182.30 → 3184.36] Bless the family and all the loved ones.
[3185.74 → 3191.00] Lord, this past month, we've had quite a few celebrations of life,
[3191.54 → 3197.14] and continue to cumber those families who have dealt with either recent or former losses.
[3197.14 → 3201.04] May God be gracious to us and bless us,
[3201.40 → 3203.74] and make his face shine upon us,
[3203.80 → 3206.20] so that your ways may be known to all the earth,
[3206.52 → 3208.50] your salvation among all the nations.
[3209.34 → 3211.02] May the people praise you, God.
[3211.36 → 3212.76] May all the people praise you.
[3213.26 → 3213.50] Amen.
[3213.50 → 3213.64] Amen.
[3213.64 → 3213.70] Amen.
[3227.14 → 3244.44] We're going to spend some time opening and reflecting on God's Word to us together,
[3244.62 → 3246.42] and we're going to do that in Romans 11.
[3246.42 → 3255.92] Now, the original plan for our time together this morning was to finish this next section of Romans 11,
[3256.06 → 3261.04] getting us up to the doxology in verses 33 through 36.
[3262.68 → 3265.94] However, in my preparations this past week,
[3265.94 → 3271.70] it became really clear to me that that was just too much material for one morning together,
[3272.12 → 3276.56] unless you were prepared to sit for 50 minutes to hear it all,
[3276.94 → 3278.98] and I wasn't prepared to do that to you.
[3279.98 → 3282.78] So I've broken this section down into two parts,
[3283.16 → 3288.30] and we'll do part one today, verses 11 through 24,
[3288.30 → 3291.98] and then when we return to the book of Romans,
[3292.12 → 3295.70] which won't be until the new year because we're entering into Advent next week,
[3296.30 → 3297.90] we'll pick it up at verse 25.
[3299.84 → 3307.14] Let me also say that I continue to be really grateful for all of your engagements
[3307.14 → 3310.86] and your feedback, emails, and conversations.
[3311.78 → 3317.64] I know that many discussions have been carried on over these pages and doctrines,
[3317.64 → 3321.22] and I know that that is not over.
[3322.56 → 3329.96] Our section today zeros in on another difficult and disputed passage.
[3331.98 → 3336.68] And so for the time being, as you can see, our sleeves are still rolled up,
[3337.32 → 3338.30] we're still digging in,
[3338.88 → 3344.00] and we're still doing the work that we can to bring our best selves to bear
[3344.00 → 3345.94] as we dig into God's Word.
[3345.94 → 3348.34] Before we do that,
[3348.62 → 3356.12] let me just remind you what we said at the beginning of this really difficult section of Romans.
[3357.48 → 3362.98] These are some of the hardest and most debated chapters in the Bible,
[3362.98 → 3366.48] and I know that I have asked a lot of you,
[3366.60 → 3368.40] that Pastor Kevin has asked a lot of you,
[3368.50 → 3373.76] and I hope, and I pray that it has been as good for you as it has been for me
[3373.76 → 3375.96] in preparing and in wrestling through that.
[3377.22 → 3381.36] Second, way back at the beginning of this hard section,
[3381.66 → 3385.86] I pointed out that Paul ends in worship.
[3385.86 → 3390.18] And so as we are right now in the middle of this really hard section,
[3390.70 → 3392.02] let's say that again.
[3392.40 → 3394.04] When doctrines are tough,
[3394.20 → 3397.62] and when the mind is beginning to be boggled,
[3397.70 → 3399.42] or has been boggled for a long time,
[3399.68 → 3403.98] over these ultimately incomprehensible truths of God,
[3404.08 → 3406.46] all we can say is,
[3406.46 → 3409.76] to Him be the glory forever.
[3411.28 → 3412.66] The point is,
[3412.70 → 3413.64] I hope you hear,
[3414.04 → 3419.66] bring your wrestling faith into worship.
[3421.14 → 3424.00] Bring your faith-seeking understanding
[3424.00 → 3426.42] to the place of our songs together,
[3427.34 → 3428.38] and our hymns,
[3428.74 → 3429.96] and our spiritual songs.
[3429.96 → 3432.36] It can be really tempting,
[3433.26 → 3433.56] right,
[3433.60 → 3436.18] when things get hard to understand,
[3436.38 → 3438.28] or hard to wrap our minds around,
[3438.62 → 3442.10] it can be really tempting just to throw our hands up and walk away.
[3443.32 → 3443.78] Instead,
[3444.28 → 3445.48] what I hope we can do
[3445.48 → 3449.00] is lift our hands in worship and prayer together.
[3450.50 → 3452.84] So after this message,
[3453.02 → 3454.86] our song of response
[3454.86 → 3456.56] is going to walk us through
[3456.56 → 3458.56] some of these doctrines,
[3458.56 → 3460.06] and some of these truths about God.
[3461.54 → 3463.96] And so I invite you already now
[3463.96 → 3466.56] to begin preparing your heart
[3466.56 → 3468.96] to sing our doxology
[3468.96 → 3472.56] filled with this theology.
[3473.46 → 3475.32] To hear the things of God,
[3475.42 → 3477.16] the mystery and the majesty,
[3477.34 → 3478.62] the word and the wonder,
[3478.80 → 3479.72] and to sing,
[3480.52 → 3481.94] oh, the depths of the riches
[3481.94 → 3483.76] of the wisdom and knowledge of God,
[3483.76 → 3485.68] how unsearchable His judgments
[3485.68 → 3487.88] and His path beyond tracing out,
[3487.88 → 3490.10] who has known the mind of the Lord,
[3490.18 → 3491.66] or who has been His counsellor.
[3492.12 → 3493.86] For from Him and through Him
[3493.86 → 3495.86] and for Him are all things.
[3496.00 → 3498.28] To Him be the glory forever.
[3499.12 → 3499.48] Amen.
[3500.82 → 3501.36] And so,
[3501.72 → 3503.14] like we said one more time,
[3503.34 → 3504.62] let's push in
[3504.62 → 3507.98] so that we give glory to God,
[3508.34 → 3510.70] a doxology of amens.
[3510.70 → 3512.48] With that,
[3512.92 → 3513.72] let's read
[3513.72 → 3515.48] from Romans 11,
[3516.20 → 3517.86] chapter 11,
[3517.98 → 3520.64] verse 11 through 24.
[3521.40 → 3522.58] The first time through,
[3522.72 → 3524.26] it will be on the screen behind me.
[3524.78 → 3525.68] If you have a Bible,
[3525.80 → 3527.18] I encourage you to keep that with you
[3527.18 → 3529.86] as we will be working back through it.
[3532.36 → 3533.60] Again, I ask,
[3534.68 → 3535.82] did they stumble,
[3536.10 → 3536.84] this Israel,
[3536.84 → 3538.38] did they stumble
[3538.38 → 3541.36] to fall beyond recovery?
[3542.04 → 3542.84] Not at all.
[3543.56 → 3544.00] Rather,
[3544.72 → 3546.40] because of their transgression,
[3546.74 → 3548.86] salvation has come to the Gentiles
[3548.86 → 3550.56] to make Israel envious.
[3551.60 → 3553.14] But if their transgression
[3553.14 → 3554.96] means riches for the world
[3554.96 → 3557.68] and their loss means riches for the Gentiles,
[3557.76 → 3559.30] how much greater riches
[3559.30 → 3561.50] will their full inclusion bring?
[3561.50 → 3565.60] I am talking to you Gentiles
[3565.60 → 3568.22] inasmuch as I am an apostle to the Gentiles.
[3568.36 → 3570.14] I take pride in my ministry
[3570.14 → 3572.08] in the hope that I may somehow
[3572.08 → 3574.22] arouse my own people
[3574.22 → 3576.56] to envy and save some of them.
[3578.22 → 3579.80] For if their rejection
[3579.80 → 3581.94] brought reconciliation to the world,
[3582.42 → 3583.96] what will their acceptance be
[3583.96 → 3585.04] but life from the dead?
[3585.98 → 3587.22] If the part of the dough
[3587.22 → 3588.86] offered as first fruits is holy,
[3588.98 → 3590.16] then the whole batch is holy.
[3590.28 → 3591.32] If the root is holy,
[3591.32 → 3592.90] so are the branches.
[3594.30 → 3595.30] If some branches
[3595.30 → 3596.52] have been broken off
[3596.52 → 3597.12] and you,
[3597.34 → 3598.94] though a wild olive shoot,
[3599.04 → 3600.10] have been grafted in
[3600.10 → 3601.04] among the others
[3601.04 → 3602.28] and now share
[3602.28 → 3603.48] in the nourishing sap
[3603.48 → 3604.52] from the olive root,
[3604.88 → 3606.62] do not consider yourself
[3606.62 → 3607.52] to be superior
[3607.52 → 3608.92] to those other branches.
[3609.98 → 3611.06] If you do,
[3612.10 → 3613.06] consider this.
[3613.58 → 3614.96] You do not support the root,
[3615.06 → 3616.52] but the root supports you.
[3617.40 → 3618.66] You will say then,
[3618.90 → 3620.12] branches were broken off
[3620.12 → 3621.58] so that I could be grafted in.
[3622.10 → 3622.40] Granted,
[3622.72 → 3623.98] but they were broken off
[3623.98 → 3625.18] because of unbelief,
[3625.18 → 3627.62] and you stand by faith.
[3628.84 → 3629.74] Do not be arrogant,
[3630.52 → 3631.22] but tremble.
[3631.78 → 3632.86] For if God did not spare
[3632.86 → 3633.82] the natural branches,
[3634.08 → 3636.74] He will not spare you either.
[3638.10 → 3639.20] Consider, therefore,
[3639.20 → 3641.92] the kindness and sternness of God.
[3643.52 → 3644.98] Sternness to those who fell,
[3645.12 → 3646.68] but kindness to you,
[3647.34 → 3648.80] provided that you continue
[3648.80 → 3650.10] in His kindness.
[3651.44 → 3651.80] Otherwise,
[3652.08 → 3653.38] you will also be cut off.
[3654.46 → 3657.08] And if they do not persist in unbelief,
[3657.18 → 3658.52] they will be grafted in,
[3658.66 → 3661.42] for God is able to graft them in again.
[3661.42 → 3662.94] After all,
[3663.06 → 3664.04] if you were cut out
[3664.04 → 3665.00] of an olive tree
[3665.00 → 3666.26] that is wild by nature,
[3666.62 → 3667.78] and contrary to nature,
[3667.84 → 3668.68] was grafted into
[3668.68 → 3670.14] a cultivated olive tree,
[3670.30 → 3671.52] how much more readily
[3671.52 → 3673.32] will these natural branches
[3673.32 → 3674.46] be grafted in
[3674.46 → 3676.88] to their own olive tree?
[3677.70 → 3678.90] This is the word of the Lord.
[3683.08 → 3683.86] Excuse me.
[3685.16 → 3686.20] So, chapter 11,
[3686.42 → 3687.36] as we have seen,
[3687.36 → 3690.46] is an answer to the question,
[3691.06 → 3694.08] did God reject His people?
[3695.42 → 3695.56] Right?
[3695.64 → 3696.26] And Paul,
[3696.44 → 3697.16] in the midst of this,
[3697.24 → 3698.98] has revealed his angst
[3698.98 → 3700.46] and his anxiety
[3700.46 → 3702.46] over his people,
[3702.60 → 3703.96] the people of Israel,
[3704.36 → 3706.00] who, at the time,
[3706.16 → 3706.56] ignored,
[3707.10 → 3707.50] rejected,
[3707.80 → 3709.64] and ultimately crucified
[3709.64 → 3710.60] Jesus.
[3712.12 → 3714.04] And he has shown
[3714.04 → 3716.96] how God's choosing a people
[3716.96 → 3718.82] was never, in fact,
[3718.96 → 3720.96] about physical descendants,
[3721.52 → 3722.56] but, ultimately,
[3722.88 → 3725.36] always about God's own faithfulness
[3725.36 → 3727.28] to His own promise.
[3728.12 → 3728.26] Right?
[3728.32 → 3729.38] God's own mercy
[3729.38 → 3730.90] on whom He will have mercy.
[3731.10 → 3732.08] It's the language we've seen
[3732.08 → 3733.14] in this section.
[3734.64 → 3737.24] God then reminds us,
[3737.46 → 3738.24] through the writing
[3738.24 → 3739.88] of this chapter,
[3740.06 → 3741.60] that He is God
[3741.60 → 3742.70] and we are not.
[3742.76 → 3744.14] That He is the potter
[3744.14 → 3745.34] and He can make
[3745.34 → 3746.56] whatever He will.
[3746.96 → 3748.64] And throughout all of this,
[3748.74 → 3748.90] right,
[3748.98 → 3750.92] two things we have held up
[3750.92 → 3751.68] as true.
[3752.72 → 3754.60] That God is faithful
[3754.60 → 3755.96] to His promise
[3755.96 → 3757.32] and humanity
[3757.32 → 3758.86] is responsible
[3758.86 → 3760.40] for our rejection
[3760.40 → 3761.74] of God.
[3762.22 → 3763.84] Israel is responsible
[3763.84 → 3765.30] for her rejection
[3765.30 → 3766.62] of God's Messiah,
[3766.74 → 3767.32] of Jesus,
[3767.60 → 3769.54] who was preached to her
[3769.54 → 3771.58] by the apostles.
[3771.58 → 3773.60] that preached word
[3773.60 → 3774.42] went out
[3774.42 → 3775.96] and is going out
[3775.96 → 3777.00] through the ages
[3777.00 → 3778.68] right up to this moment
[3778.68 → 3779.40] right now.
[3779.68 → 3780.94] We are living
[3780.94 → 3783.10] in this text.
[3784.10 → 3785.48] We, here,
[3786.28 → 3787.24] are being called
[3787.24 → 3788.08] to profess
[3788.08 → 3789.58] Jesus is Lord
[3789.58 → 3791.04] and God raised Him
[3791.04 → 3792.10] from the dead.
[3792.94 → 3793.94] But the question
[3793.94 → 3795.40] that comes out of that,
[3795.48 → 3796.94] that we're grounded in now,
[3797.04 → 3798.16] really comes naturally
[3798.16 → 3798.80] and I think
[3798.80 → 3800.24] is obviously connected
[3800.24 → 3800.66] to say,
[3800.66 → 3801.56] wait a minute,
[3802.40 → 3803.66] if the people
[3803.66 → 3804.76] rejected God,
[3805.46 → 3807.30] does God reject them?
[3808.18 → 3808.30] Right?
[3808.34 → 3810.26] If Israel rejected Jesus
[3810.26 → 3811.36] as God's son,
[3811.76 → 3812.84] does God
[3812.84 → 3814.34] reject His people?
[3816.00 → 3817.64] And Paul's answer
[3817.64 → 3818.32] is immediate
[3818.32 → 3819.74] and it is emphatic.
[3819.88 → 3820.40] He says,
[3820.54 → 3822.38] by no means.
[3823.42 → 3823.90] And then,
[3823.98 → 3825.78] he gives three reasons
[3825.78 → 3826.54] and I'll recap
[3826.54 → 3827.26] those reasons
[3827.26 → 3828.12] for you.
[3828.22 → 3828.54] First,
[3829.44 → 3830.80] Israel's unbelief
[3830.80 → 3831.74] isn't total.
[3832.40 → 3832.52] Right?
[3832.60 → 3833.42] There is always
[3833.42 → 3834.32] a remnant
[3834.32 → 3835.60] and the elect
[3835.60 → 3836.86] that is God's chosen
[3836.86 → 3838.44] will always reveal
[3838.44 → 3839.66] themselves in the end.
[3840.54 → 3840.64] Right?
[3840.68 → 3841.46] That's chapter 11
[3841.46 → 3842.58] in the first 10 verses.
[3842.82 → 3843.56] We looked at that
[3843.56 → 3844.42] last week.
[3845.88 → 3847.08] The second reason
[3847.08 → 3847.62] he gives
[3847.62 → 3849.36] is that Israel's stumble,
[3849.66 → 3850.78] that's from verse 11
[3850.78 → 3851.44] here,
[3851.64 → 3852.50] where we started,
[3853.06 → 3854.18] was for the purpose
[3854.18 → 3855.50] of the inclusion
[3855.50 → 3856.70] of the Gentiles
[3856.70 → 3858.72] and it's important
[3858.72 → 3859.14] to note
[3859.14 → 3860.58] that natural descendants
[3860.58 → 3863.96] or natural trees
[3863.96 → 3865.04] are more readily
[3865.04 → 3866.54] grafted back in
[3866.54 → 3867.50] to the source.
[3868.50 → 3869.00] And then,
[3869.08 → 3870.34] the third reason
[3870.34 → 3871.64] he gives
[3871.64 → 3873.64] is that at some point
[3873.64 → 3874.56] all Israel
[3874.56 → 3875.68] will be saved.
[3876.12 → 3876.26] Now,
[3876.30 → 3877.46] Paul says in verse 31,
[3877.72 → 3878.96] which we didn't read yet,
[3879.42 → 3880.24] they have become
[3880.24 → 3881.04] disobedient
[3881.04 → 3882.22] in order that they too
[3882.22 → 3883.36] may now receive
[3883.36 → 3884.98] mercy as a result
[3884.98 → 3886.10] of God's mercy
[3886.10 → 3886.94] to you.
[3888.18 → 3888.56] Now,
[3888.62 → 3889.56] it's that number two
[3889.56 → 3890.72] that we're looking
[3890.72 → 3891.40] at this morning.
[3892.24 → 3892.36] Right?
[3892.46 → 3893.86] Number one was last week,
[3893.96 → 3895.08] number two is today,
[3895.16 → 3896.18] and then number three
[3896.18 → 3897.18] that will be
[3897.18 → 3897.76] in the future.
[3899.16 → 3899.36] Now,
[3899.48 → 3902.28] our big idea,
[3902.48 → 3903.14] our expanding
[3903.14 → 3904.72] on this number two
[3904.72 → 3905.24] for us,
[3905.64 → 3908.42] is that Israel's stumble
[3908.42 → 3911.78] was for God's purposes.
[3911.78 → 3913.56] right?
[3913.80 → 3914.36] One,
[3914.68 → 3916.46] that people like us
[3916.46 → 3917.30] might be brought
[3917.30 → 3918.42] into this plan
[3918.42 → 3919.14] of salvation,
[3919.82 → 3920.50] and then two,
[3920.94 → 3922.36] that by the Gentiles
[3922.36 → 3923.34] being included,
[3923.76 → 3925.22] Israel might then
[3925.22 → 3926.22] in response
[3926.22 → 3927.16] be turned
[3927.16 → 3928.28] to belief.
[3929.70 → 3930.62] And then after making
[3930.62 → 3931.56] those two points,
[3932.34 → 3933.54] Paul's going to sum up
[3933.54 → 3935.06] what he's talking about
[3935.06 → 3936.02] with some ideas
[3936.02 → 3937.22] for application.
[3937.22 → 3937.30] salvation.
[3939.36 → 3939.56] And so,
[3939.64 → 3940.20] as we dig into
[3940.20 → 3941.42] this second reason
[3941.42 → 3942.30] that Paul gives
[3942.30 → 3942.78] in response
[3942.78 → 3943.60] to the question
[3943.60 → 3947.06] of Israel being rejected,
[3947.40 → 3948.18] or has Israel
[3948.18 → 3949.34] being rejected,
[3950.36 → 3952.30] underneath that
[3952.30 → 3953.64] is the idea
[3953.64 → 3955.26] that God
[3955.26 → 3957.46] has a purpose
[3957.46 → 3959.14] for even what
[3959.14 → 3959.58] they're seeing
[3959.58 → 3960.04] right now.
[3961.04 → 3961.42] Right?
[3961.42 → 3963.42] even the apparent
[3963.42 → 3964.58] rejection
[3964.58 → 3966.54] of God
[3966.54 → 3967.80] is used
[3967.80 → 3968.98] by God
[3968.98 → 3969.62] for
[3969.62 → 3970.52] his
[3970.52 → 3971.48] purpose.
[3973.62 → 3973.82] Now,
[3973.84 → 3974.64] if you've been with us
[3974.64 → 3975.50] in this text,
[3975.58 → 3977.32] this isn't a new idea
[3977.32 → 3978.00] for us,
[3978.08 → 3978.28] right?
[3978.32 → 3979.36] In chapter 9,
[3980.12 → 3980.62] Paul
[3980.62 → 3982.42] uses the illustration
[3982.42 → 3983.22] of Jacob
[3983.22 → 3984.28] and Esau.
[3985.44 → 3985.72] Right?
[3986.08 → 3986.82] Twins,
[3986.96 → 3988.04] Esau the older,
[3988.58 → 3989.68] and by natural
[3989.68 → 3990.62] birth rights
[3990.62 → 3991.30] and order,
[3991.46 → 3992.02] the one who
[3992.02 → 3993.00] ought to inherit
[3993.00 → 3993.80] the blessings
[3993.80 → 3995.16] and the name
[3995.16 → 3996.98] of their father,
[3998.16 → 3999.48] but God
[3999.48 → 4000.34] had other purposes.
[4002.04 → 4002.74] Paul writes
[4002.74 → 4004.10] in chapter 9,
[4004.16 → 4004.68] verse 11,
[4005.42 → 4006.32] before the twins
[4006.32 → 4006.88] were born
[4006.88 → 4007.58] or had done
[4007.58 → 4008.40] anything good
[4008.40 → 4008.98] or bad
[4008.98 → 4009.70] in order
[4009.70 → 4010.66] that God's
[4010.66 → 4011.22] purposes
[4011.22 → 4012.32] in election
[4012.32 → 4013.38] might stand,
[4013.90 → 4014.88] not by works,
[4015.24 → 4015.86] but by him
[4015.86 → 4016.46] who calls.
[4018.34 → 4019.36] Point is,
[4019.36 → 4020.72] God has
[4020.72 → 4021.54] purposes
[4021.54 → 4023.48] in election.
[4024.72 → 4024.96] Now,
[4025.64 → 4026.18] I want to take
[4026.18 → 4026.74] just a moment
[4026.74 → 4027.46] and pause
[4027.46 → 4028.00] right there.
[4028.64 → 4029.04] If you have
[4029.04 → 4029.84] the worship sheet
[4029.84 → 4030.26] that you got
[4030.26 → 4031.04] on your way in,
[4031.80 → 4032.42] you will see
[4032.42 → 4033.04] that the title
[4033.04 → 4033.94] of this message
[4033.94 → 4035.08] is God's
[4035.08 → 4035.66] sovereignty.
[4036.50 → 4037.24] You keep
[4037.24 → 4038.12] using that word.
[4039.24 → 4039.40] Now,
[4039.58 → 4040.12] some of you
[4040.12 → 4040.52] have probably
[4040.52 → 4041.22] got the
[4041.22 → 4041.84] implicit
[4041.84 → 4042.86] princess bride
[4042.86 → 4043.82] reference in there,
[4043.82 → 4047.08] but what I'm
[4047.08 → 4047.80] aware of
[4047.80 → 4048.46] is that
[4048.46 → 4049.24] words like
[4049.24 → 4049.80] sovereignty
[4049.80 → 4051.08] and election
[4051.08 → 4052.04] come with
[4052.04 → 4052.66] a lot of
[4052.66 → 4053.34] confusion
[4053.34 → 4055.18] to many of us
[4055.18 → 4056.08] and they come
[4056.08 → 4056.42] with a lot
[4056.42 → 4057.08] of challenges
[4057.08 → 4058.62] and difficulty
[4058.62 → 4059.70] in understanding
[4059.70 → 4060.54] and so
[4060.54 → 4061.92] I just want to say
[4061.92 → 4062.62] we keep using
[4062.62 → 4063.06] that word
[4063.06 → 4064.52] because the Bible
[4064.52 → 4065.44] is using that word
[4065.44 → 4066.38] but also
[4066.38 → 4067.18] because
[4067.18 → 4068.28] the sovereignty
[4068.28 → 4069.22] of God
[4069.22 → 4071.34] is foundational
[4071.34 → 4073.26] to God
[4073.26 → 4073.84] being God.
[4074.86 → 4075.70] It's foundational
[4075.70 → 4077.26] to life
[4077.26 → 4078.46] lived in Him
[4078.46 → 4079.24] having any
[4079.24 → 4080.24] meaning or purpose
[4080.24 → 4082.58] and so
[4082.58 → 4083.66] when we say
[4083.66 → 4084.20] things
[4084.20 → 4085.08] that God
[4085.08 → 4085.56] does what He
[4085.56 → 4085.82] does
[4085.82 → 4086.16] in order that
[4086.16 → 4086.72] His purposes
[4086.72 → 4087.36] in election
[4087.36 → 4088.12] might stand
[4088.12 → 4089.06] we are grounding
[4089.06 → 4089.84] ourselves
[4089.84 → 4090.60] in the very
[4090.60 → 4091.42] being
[4091.42 → 4092.56] and character
[4092.56 → 4093.60] of God
[4093.60 → 4095.20] who is sovereign
[4095.20 → 4097.40] and the point
[4097.40 → 4097.80] is
[4097.80 → 4098.54] the foundation
[4098.54 → 4099.18] of this
[4099.18 → 4099.74] is that
[4099.74 → 4100.88] God has
[4100.88 → 4101.92] these purposes
[4101.92 → 4103.40] now we might
[4103.40 → 4104.04] not be able
[4104.04 → 4104.96] to discern them
[4104.96 → 4106.62] we might not
[4106.62 → 4107.94] even know them
[4107.94 → 4109.76] but
[4109.76 → 4111.42] that's part
[4111.42 → 4112.20] of what makes
[4112.20 → 4112.58] God
[4112.58 → 4113.34] God
[4113.34 → 4115.56] can I say
[4115.56 → 4116.88] this boldly
[4116.88 → 4117.22] to you
[4117.22 → 4118.42] if you could
[4118.42 → 4119.04] understand
[4119.04 → 4119.72] everything
[4119.72 → 4120.36] that God
[4120.36 → 4120.82] does
[4120.82 → 4122.38] He wouldn't
[4122.38 → 4122.76] be much
[4122.76 → 4123.30] of a God
[4123.30 → 4127.28] it's the same
[4127.28 → 4127.82] thing then
[4127.82 → 4129.30] with Israel's
[4129.30 → 4129.72] rejection
[4129.72 → 4131.00] God
[4131.00 → 4131.18] God
[4131.18 → 4131.64] has a
[4131.64 → 4132.26] purpose
[4132.26 → 4133.64] for their
[4133.64 → 4134.32] stumbling
[4134.32 → 4135.90] let's
[4135.90 → 4136.58] build on the
[4136.58 → 4136.84] metaphor
[4136.84 → 4137.32] that's used
[4137.32 → 4137.48] here
[4137.48 → 4138.58] the stone
[4138.58 → 4138.92] that the
[4138.92 → 4139.30] builders
[4139.30 → 4139.74] have
[4139.74 → 4140.32] rejected
[4140.32 → 4141.12] has become
[4141.12 → 4142.10] the cornerstone
[4142.10 → 4143.20] that stone
[4143.20 → 4143.78] is
[4143.78 → 4144.54] Jesus
[4144.54 → 4145.26] and many
[4145.26 → 4145.58] of the
[4145.58 → 4145.92] Israelites
[4145.92 → 4146.54] of his
[4146.54 → 4146.88] day
[4146.88 → 4147.50] rejected
[4147.50 → 4147.90] him
[4147.90 → 4149.02] and stumbled
[4149.02 → 4149.88] over the
[4149.88 → 4150.40] idea
[4150.40 → 4151.00] that he
[4151.00 → 4152.04] was Messiah
[4152.04 → 4152.56] that he
[4152.56 → 4153.90] was God
[4153.90 → 4155.64] in 1 Corinthians
[4155.64 → 4156.86] 1 Paul
[4156.86 → 4157.38] writes
[4157.38 → 4158.08] very clearly
[4158.08 → 4159.20] we preach
[4159.20 → 4159.62] Christ
[4159.62 → 4160.38] crucified
[4160.38 → 4161.34] a stumbling
[4161.34 → 4161.92] block
[4161.92 → 4162.66] to the
[4162.66 → 4163.16] Jews
[4163.16 → 4164.50] and foolishness
[4164.50 → 4164.96] to the
[4164.96 → 4165.50] Gentiles
[4165.50 → 4167.76] and yet
[4167.76 → 4168.58] because of
[4168.58 → 4169.38] God's purposes
[4169.38 → 4170.30] in election
[4170.30 → 4170.88] notice
[4170.88 → 4171.50] verse 11
[4171.50 → 4171.82] we're now
[4171.82 → 4172.34] back in our
[4172.34 → 4172.86] text here
[4172.86 → 4173.56] verse 11
[4173.56 → 4175.80] because of
[4175.80 → 4176.20] their
[4176.20 → 4177.58] transgressions
[4177.58 → 4178.56] salvation
[4178.56 → 4179.42] has come
[4179.42 → 4179.82] to the
[4179.82 → 4180.56] Gentiles
[4180.56 → 4181.38] to make
[4181.38 → 4182.34] Israel
[4182.34 → 4184.38] envious
[4184.38 → 4185.52] so first
[4185.52 → 4185.80] notice
[4185.80 → 4186.28] because of
[4186.28 → 4186.40] their
[4186.40 → 4187.06] transgressions
[4187.06 → 4187.62] salvation
[4187.62 → 4188.38] has come
[4188.38 → 4189.04] to the
[4189.04 → 4189.54] Gentiles
[4189.54 → 4189.74] now
[4189.74 → 4190.90] Gentiles
[4190.90 → 4191.32] maybe that's
[4191.32 → 4191.60] a word
[4191.60 → 4192.02] you're not
[4192.02 → 4192.60] familiar with
[4192.60 → 4193.22] it simply
[4193.22 → 4194.04] means in
[4194.04 → 4194.72] the Bible
[4194.72 → 4195.96] other nations
[4195.96 → 4196.94] right
[4196.94 → 4197.46] Gentiles
[4197.46 → 4197.80] is just
[4197.80 → 4198.18] the word
[4198.18 → 4198.46] that the
[4198.46 → 4198.70] Bible
[4198.70 → 4199.08] uses
[4199.08 → 4199.84] for nations
[4199.84 → 4200.34] for people
[4200.34 → 4200.66] who are
[4200.66 → 4201.10] not
[4201.10 → 4202.18] ethnically
[4202.18 → 4203.14] Jewish
[4203.14 → 4204.30] Paul
[4204.30 → 4204.72] continues
[4204.72 → 4205.44] making his
[4205.44 → 4205.72] point
[4205.72 → 4206.04] in verse
[4206.04 → 4206.44] 12
[4206.44 → 4206.86] he says
[4206.86 → 4207.74] their loss
[4207.74 → 4208.22] that is
[4208.22 → 4208.98] the nation
[4208.98 → 4209.74] of Israel's
[4209.74 → 4210.02] loss
[4210.02 → 4211.04] means riches
[4211.04 → 4212.50] for the
[4212.50 → 4213.06] Gentiles
[4213.06 → 4215.08] now
[4215.08 → 4217.20] here's what
[4217.20 → 4217.40] you need
[4217.40 → 4217.80] to know
[4217.80 → 4218.62] right
[4218.62 → 4219.72] from the
[4219.72 → 4220.14] very
[4220.14 → 4220.76] beginning
[4220.76 → 4221.90] from the
[4221.90 → 4222.20] very
[4222.20 → 4222.64] beginning
[4222.64 → 4223.24] God's
[4223.24 → 4223.98] purpose
[4223.98 → 4225.14] in election
[4225.14 → 4225.94] was to
[4225.94 → 4226.70] include
[4226.70 → 4227.56] Gentiles
[4227.56 → 4228.08] in his
[4228.08 → 4228.60] salvation
[4228.60 → 4229.62] right
[4229.62 → 4229.84] and this
[4229.84 → 4230.24] is clear
[4230.24 → 4230.68] from the
[4230.68 → 4231.10] very beginning
[4231.10 → 4231.82] from God's
[4231.82 → 4232.62] promise to
[4232.62 → 4233.12] Adam and
[4233.12 → 4233.74] Eve to
[4233.74 → 4234.42] undo the
[4234.42 → 4234.74] curse
[4234.74 → 4235.14] with a
[4235.14 → 4235.46] son
[4235.46 → 4236.30] who would
[4236.30 → 4236.78] come and
[4236.78 → 4237.28] crush the
[4237.28 → 4237.58] head of
[4237.58 → 4238.00] the serpent
[4238.00 → 4238.50] in Genesis
[4238.50 → 4239.70] 3 15
[4239.70 → 4240.32] right
[4240.32 → 4240.66] this is
[4240.66 → 4241.04] clear
[4241.04 → 4241.96] when God
[4241.96 → 4242.44] says to
[4242.44 → 4242.90] Abraham
[4242.90 → 4243.94] that God
[4243.94 → 4244.36] will make
[4244.36 → 4244.86] Abraham
[4244.86 → 4245.54] a great
[4245.54 → 4245.90] nation
[4245.90 → 4246.40] that all
[4246.40 → 4246.92] the nations
[4246.92 → 4247.24] on the
[4247.24 → 4247.44] earth
[4247.44 → 4247.86] will be
[4247.86 → 4248.32] blessed
[4248.32 → 4248.92] through
[4248.92 → 4249.64] him
[4249.64 → 4250.06] right
[4250.06 → 4250.72] that God's
[4250.72 → 4251.36] salvation
[4251.36 → 4251.86] plan
[4251.86 → 4252.30] was for
[4252.30 → 4252.62] the whole
[4252.62 → 4253.02] world
[4253.02 → 4253.60] is clear
[4253.60 → 4254.50] when God
[4254.50 → 4255.02] promises
[4255.02 → 4255.66] David
[4255.66 → 4256.64] an everlasting
[4256.64 → 4257.34] kingdom
[4257.34 → 4258.72] that will
[4258.72 → 4259.18] have no
[4259.18 → 4259.48] end
[4259.48 → 4259.76] and then
[4259.76 → 4260.18] Isaiah
[4260.18 → 4260.90] takes that
[4260.90 → 4261.32] promise
[4261.32 → 4261.86] and he
[4261.86 → 4262.44] applies it
[4262.44 → 4262.84] to a
[4262.84 → 4263.24] son
[4263.24 → 4263.86] where he
[4263.86 → 4264.08] says
[4264.08 → 4264.80] the government
[4264.80 → 4265.24] will be
[4265.24 → 4265.66] on his
[4265.66 → 4266.08] shoulders
[4266.08 → 4266.90] and of
[4266.90 → 4267.46] the greatness
[4267.46 → 4268.00] of his
[4268.00 → 4268.38] government
[4268.38 → 4268.96] and peace
[4268.96 → 4269.42] there will
[4269.42 → 4270.32] be no
[4270.32 → 4271.08] end
[4271.08 → 4271.64] right
[4271.64 → 4272.24] that God's
[4272.24 → 4272.72] plan of
[4272.72 → 4273.20] salvation
[4273.20 → 4273.80] and redemption
[4273.80 → 4274.24] was for
[4274.24 → 4274.56] the whole
[4274.56 → 4274.90] world
[4274.90 → 4275.80] is clear
[4275.80 → 4276.18] in the
[4276.18 → 4276.60] prophet
[4276.60 → 4277.46] Habakkuk
[4277.46 → 4277.90] saying
[4277.90 → 4278.54] for the
[4278.54 → 4278.88] earth
[4278.88 → 4279.24] will be
[4279.24 → 4279.56] filled
[4279.56 → 4279.90] with the
[4279.90 → 4280.24] knowledge
[4280.24 → 4280.54] of the
[4280.54 → 4280.84] glory
[4280.84 → 4281.18] of the
[4281.18 → 4281.46] Lord
[4281.46 → 4281.88] as the
[4281.88 → 4282.32] waters
[4282.32 → 4282.80] cover
[4282.80 → 4283.36] the sea
[4283.36 → 4284.34] right
[4284.34 → 4284.94] the vision
[4284.94 → 4285.70] of God
[4285.70 → 4286.20] that
[4286.20 → 4286.70] that
[4286.70 → 4288.08] of God's
[4288.08 → 4288.58] plan for
[4288.58 → 4288.98] redemption
[4288.98 → 4290.10] that culminates
[4290.10 → 4290.52] for us
[4290.52 → 4291.00] in the book
[4291.00 → 4291.70] of Revelation
[4291.70 → 4292.64] and in the
[4292.64 → 4293.12] image of
[4293.12 → 4293.50] Revelation
[4293.50 → 4294.34] 21 and
[4294.34 → 4294.72] 22
[4294.72 → 4295.68] is of a
[4295.68 → 4296.12] gathering
[4296.12 → 4296.92] from every
[4296.92 → 4297.42] nation
[4297.42 → 4298.24] tribe
[4298.24 → 4298.84] and tongue
[4298.84 → 4300.12] that was
[4300.12 → 4301.16] always
[4301.16 → 4302.48] God's
[4302.48 → 4303.00] plan
[4303.00 → 4305.32] you could
[4305.32 → 4305.70] say
[4305.70 → 4307.40] that is
[4307.40 → 4307.82] God's
[4307.82 → 4308.30] purpose
[4308.30 → 4308.74] in
[4308.74 → 4309.32] election
[4309.32 → 4313.58] but not
[4313.58 → 4314.16] only
[4314.16 → 4315.54] does God
[4315.54 → 4316.72] have a
[4316.72 → 4317.56] plan from
[4317.56 → 4318.18] the beginning
[4318.18 → 4319.80] and not
[4319.80 → 4320.70] only does
[4320.70 → 4321.48] God have
[4321.48 → 4322.20] an end
[4322.20 → 4323.06] in mind
[4323.06 → 4323.76] a goal
[4323.76 → 4324.20] to it
[4324.20 → 4324.56] all
[4324.56 → 4326.16] right
[4326.16 → 4326.46] he's
[4326.46 → 4327.02] also
[4327.02 → 4327.88] sovereign
[4327.88 → 4328.98] over this
[4328.98 → 4329.52] middle bit
[4329.52 → 4331.30] he's
[4331.30 → 4331.62] sovereign
[4331.62 → 4332.20] over the
[4332.20 → 4332.74] means
[4332.74 → 4333.26] and the
[4333.26 → 4333.78] mechanisms
[4333.78 → 4334.32] of how
[4334.32 → 4334.60] we go
[4334.60 → 4335.22] from here
[4335.22 → 4336.08] to here
[4336.08 → 4337.84] that's part
[4337.84 → 4338.10] of what
[4338.10 → 4338.50] we mean
[4338.50 → 4338.82] in the
[4338.82 → 4339.34] reformed
[4339.34 → 4339.64] tradition
[4339.64 → 4340.16] when we
[4340.16 → 4340.52] say
[4340.52 → 4341.38] quoting
[4341.38 → 4342.34] Jesus
[4342.34 → 4342.82] himself
[4342.82 → 4343.24] and
[4343.24 → 4344.54] reciting
[4344.54 → 4344.94] Heidelberg
[4344.94 → 4345.40] Catechism
[4345.40 → 4345.92] question and
[4345.92 → 4346.14] answer
[4346.14 → 4346.46] one
[4346.46 → 4347.00] that not
[4347.00 → 4347.58] a hair
[4347.58 → 4348.18] can fall
[4348.18 → 4348.64] from my
[4348.64 → 4349.04] head
[4349.04 → 4349.56] without
[4349.56 → 4350.12] the will
[4350.12 → 4350.48] of my
[4350.48 → 4350.76] father
[4350.76 → 4351.16] in heaven
[4351.16 → 4353.04] right
[4353.04 → 4353.24] that's
[4353.24 → 4353.90] the means
[4353.90 → 4354.88] and mechanisms
[4354.88 → 4355.74] action
[4355.74 → 4356.94] of God's
[4356.94 → 4357.52] sovereignty
[4357.52 → 4359.50] and so
[4359.50 → 4359.94] hear this
[4359.94 → 4360.28] as we
[4360.28 → 4360.60] wrestle
[4360.60 → 4360.96] right
[4360.96 → 4362.58] a mechanism
[4362.58 → 4363.98] in that
[4363.98 → 4364.98] great plan
[4364.98 → 4365.56] of redemption
[4365.56 → 4366.26] moving from
[4366.26 → 4366.92] Genesis all
[4366.92 → 4367.16] the way
[4367.16 → 4367.60] through to
[4367.60 → 4368.16] Revelation
[4368.16 → 4369.24] a mechanism
[4369.24 → 4369.96] is that
[4369.96 → 4370.44] plan
[4370.44 → 4372.04] is Israel's
[4372.04 → 4373.44] then current
[4373.44 → 4374.50] stumbling
[4374.50 → 4375.74] over Jesus
[4375.74 → 4376.62] as Messiah
[4376.62 → 4378.58] Israel
[4378.58 → 4379.28] stumbling
[4379.28 → 4380.22] over Jesus
[4380.22 → 4381.12] as God
[4381.12 → 4381.58] is a
[4381.58 → 4382.32] mechanism
[4382.32 → 4383.64] in God's
[4383.64 → 4383.92] sovereign
[4383.92 → 4384.32] plan
[4384.32 → 4385.20] of redemption
[4385.20 → 4386.92] let me
[4386.92 → 4387.22] say that
[4387.22 → 4387.44] again
[4387.44 → 4388.82] the purpose
[4388.82 → 4390.40] of God
[4390.40 → 4391.24] that God
[4391.24 → 4391.82] has for
[4391.82 → 4392.38] Israel's
[4392.38 → 4392.78] rejection
[4392.78 → 4393.24] of his
[4393.24 → 4393.54] son
[4393.54 → 4394.24] Jesus
[4394.24 → 4395.30] was that
[4395.30 → 4395.68] their
[4395.68 → 4396.30] stumbling
[4396.30 → 4396.96] over the
[4396.96 → 4397.78] cornerstone
[4397.78 → 4398.32] would be
[4398.32 → 4398.94] the mechanism
[4398.94 → 4399.72] by which
[4399.72 → 4400.82] the promise
[4400.82 → 4401.24] of the
[4401.24 → 4401.54] gospel
[4401.54 → 4402.04] went out
[4402.04 → 4402.30] to the
[4402.30 → 4402.84] whole world
[4402.84 → 4404.60] God
[4404.60 → 4405.50] had an
[4405.50 → 4405.94] eternal
[4405.94 → 4406.74] purpose
[4406.74 → 4407.42] and the
[4407.42 → 4408.08] means of
[4408.08 → 4408.74] that purpose
[4408.74 → 4409.34] being worked
[4409.34 → 4409.80] out in
[4409.80 → 4410.48] history
[4410.48 → 4412.06] includes
[4412.06 → 4413.22] Israel's
[4413.22 → 4413.76] rejection
[4413.76 → 4414.50] of Jesus
[4414.50 → 4414.92] at the
[4414.92 → 4415.30] time of
[4415.30 → 4415.66] Paul
[4415.66 → 4416.32] and of
[4416.32 → 4416.42] the
[4416.42 → 4416.84] disciples
[4416.84 → 4417.50] so that
[4417.50 → 4417.96] those same
[4417.96 → 4418.46] disciples
[4418.46 → 4419.24] would go
[4419.24 → 4420.08] out from
[4420.08 → 4421.04] Judea and
[4421.04 → 4421.64] Samaria
[4421.64 → 4422.12] and who
[4422.12 → 4422.44] knows the
[4422.44 → 4422.96] next line
[4422.96 → 4424.42] to the
[4424.42 → 4425.34] ends of
[4425.34 → 4425.96] the
[4425.96 → 4426.98] earth
[4426.98 → 4429.70] you're
[4429.70 → 4430.02] tracking
[4430.02 → 4431.02] with this
[4431.02 → 4432.98] right
[4432.98 → 4433.24] does this
[4433.24 → 4433.92] make sense
[4433.92 → 4434.16] that
[4434.16 → 4435.50] Paul
[4435.50 → 4437.20] is offering
[4437.20 → 4440.06] not only
[4440.06 → 4440.40] to the
[4440.40 → 4441.00] Gentiles
[4441.00 → 4441.88] but to
[4441.88 → 4442.28] his own
[4442.28 → 4442.74] people
[4442.74 → 4444.34] the comfort
[4444.34 → 4445.76] of God's
[4445.76 → 4446.30] purposes
[4446.30 → 4447.54] in election
[4447.54 → 4448.14] and it's
[4448.14 → 4448.74] the comfort
[4448.74 → 4449.68] of a
[4449.68 → 4449.98] sovereign
[4449.98 → 4450.44] God
[4450.44 → 4452.22] the reason
[4452.22 → 4452.74] he can
[4452.74 → 4453.32] say that
[4453.32 → 4453.96] God didn't
[4453.96 → 4454.96] reject Israel
[4454.96 → 4455.96] because of
[4455.96 → 4456.58] their rejection
[4456.58 → 4457.08] of him
[4457.08 → 4457.92] is because
[4457.92 → 4458.42] God
[4458.42 → 4459.24] purposed
[4459.24 → 4460.28] that rejection
[4460.28 → 4461.24] in the
[4461.24 → 4461.82] moment as
[4461.82 → 4462.54] a mechanism
[4462.54 → 4463.32] that would
[4463.32 → 4464.04] bring the
[4464.04 → 4464.96] gospel of
[4464.96 → 4465.38] Jesus
[4465.38 → 4466.20] to the
[4466.20 → 4466.76] Gentiles
[4466.76 → 4468.98] and let's
[4468.98 → 4469.58] ground this
[4469.58 → 4470.22] really
[4470.22 → 4470.88] emphatically
[4470.88 → 4472.30] this
[4472.30 → 4473.40] purpose of
[4473.40 → 4473.82] God
[4473.82 → 4474.96] is the
[4474.96 → 4475.40] reason
[4475.40 → 4476.16] you and
[4476.16 → 4476.48] I are
[4476.48 → 4476.82] here
[4476.82 → 4480.40] my belief
[4480.40 → 4481.22] right now
[4481.22 → 4481.76] in this
[4481.76 → 4482.10] moment
[4482.10 → 4482.88] is made
[4482.88 → 4483.48] possible
[4483.48 → 4484.38] because
[4484.38 → 4485.58] this faith
[4485.58 → 4486.42] that is being
[4486.42 → 4487.00] a disciple
[4487.00 → 4487.62] of Jesus
[4487.62 → 4488.78] went beyond
[4488.78 → 4489.44] ethnic
[4489.44 → 4490.02] Israel
[4490.02 → 4491.62] because it
[4491.62 → 4492.02] was never
[4492.02 → 4492.56] about
[4492.56 → 4493.08] ethnic
[4493.08 → 4493.54] Israel
[4493.54 → 4493.90] but about
[4493.90 → 4494.52] a spiritual
[4494.52 → 4495.28] Israel
[4495.28 → 4495.66] and a
[4495.66 → 4496.14] spiritual
[4496.14 → 4496.50] Israel
[4496.50 → 4497.08] was always
[4497.08 → 4497.58] the church
[4497.58 → 4497.88] and the
[4497.88 → 4498.18] church
[4498.18 → 4498.96] was always
[4498.96 → 4499.42] spiritual
[4499.42 → 4500.00] Israel
[4500.00 → 4500.42] right
[4500.42 → 4501.40] the real
[4501.40 → 4501.98] and true
[4501.98 → 4502.64] descendants
[4502.64 → 4503.64] of Abraham
[4503.64 → 4510.22] the mechanism
[4510.22 → 4511.06] of God's
[4511.06 → 4511.92] sovereignty
[4511.92 → 4513.44] active in
[4513.44 → 4514.06] the world
[4514.06 → 4514.70] so that
[4514.70 → 4515.28] we could
[4515.28 → 4515.92] be here
[4515.92 → 4517.44] is
[4517.44 → 4518.74] Israel's
[4518.74 → 4519.18] then
[4519.18 → 4519.90] rejection
[4519.90 → 4520.00] salvation
[4520.00 → 4521.24] of Jesus
[4521.24 → 4523.40] that's
[4523.40 → 4523.70] how all
[4523.70 → 4524.02] nations
[4524.02 → 4524.56] are blessed
[4524.56 → 4525.26] through
[4525.26 → 4525.68] Abraham
[4525.68 → 4527.04] that's
[4527.04 → 4527.32] how the
[4527.32 → 4527.68] whole
[4527.68 → 4528.08] earth
[4528.08 → 4528.56] is filled
[4528.56 → 4528.86] with the
[4528.86 → 4529.24] knowledge
[4529.24 → 4529.58] and the
[4529.58 → 4529.88] glory
[4529.88 → 4530.62] of the
[4530.62 → 4530.84] Lord
[4530.84 → 4531.62] that's
[4531.62 → 4531.94] how the
[4531.94 → 4532.34] vision
[4532.34 → 4533.10] of revelation
[4533.10 → 4533.54] of every
[4533.54 → 4534.00] tribe
[4534.00 → 4534.60] tongue
[4534.60 → 4535.24] and nation
[4535.24 → 4535.60] singing
[4535.60 → 4536.06] holy
[4536.06 → 4536.56] holy
[4536.56 → 4537.00] holy
[4537.00 → 4537.74] worthy
[4537.74 → 4538.16] is the
[4538.16 → 4538.48] lamb
[4538.48 → 4538.80] who was
[4538.80 → 4539.14] slain
[4539.14 → 4539.72] that's
[4539.72 → 4540.02] how that
[4540.02 → 4540.34] vision
[4540.34 → 4540.80] is
[4540.80 → 4541.24] accomplished
[4541.24 → 4544.52] this
[4544.52 → 4546.10] is the
[4546.10 → 4546.46] mission
[4546.46 → 4547.00] of God
[4547.00 → 4547.34] then
[4547.34 → 4547.74] that we
[4547.74 → 4548.20] get to
[4548.20 → 4548.72] join
[4548.72 → 4549.44] him
[4549.44 → 4550.12] in
[4550.12 → 4552.70] and I
[4552.70 → 4553.06] for one
[4553.06 → 4553.46] think that's
[4553.46 → 4554.12] pretty awesome
[4554.12 → 4556.84] that we
[4556.84 → 4557.96] now have
[4557.96 → 4558.54] the opportunity
[4558.54 → 4559.40] to become
[4559.40 → 4560.48] the mechanism
[4560.48 → 4561.26] of God's
[4561.26 → 4561.62] purposes
[4561.62 → 4562.22] in election
[4562.22 → 4566.18] and even
[4566.18 → 4566.64] as that
[4566.64 → 4567.32] is happening
[4567.32 → 4569.12] among us
[4569.12 → 4569.82] and through
[4569.82 → 4570.24] us
[4570.24 → 4570.86] and in
[4570.86 → 4571.28] us
[4571.28 → 4572.28] this
[4572.28 → 4573.12] story
[4573.12 → 4574.12] isn't
[4574.12 → 4575.14] over
[4575.14 → 4576.88] right
[4576.88 → 4577.56] Paul
[4577.56 → 4578.08] has
[4578.08 → 4579.02] hope
[4579.02 → 4579.80] for the
[4579.80 → 4580.28] redemption
[4580.28 → 4581.08] of his
[4581.08 → 4581.64] brothers
[4581.64 → 4583.12] of Israel
[4583.12 → 4583.62] because
[4583.62 → 4584.56] history
[4584.56 → 4585.22] isn't
[4585.22 → 4585.84] over
[4585.84 → 4586.98] right
[4586.98 → 4587.64] as long
[4587.64 → 4588.10] as it
[4588.10 → 4588.98] is today
[4588.98 → 4590.02] there's still
[4590.02 → 4590.58] a reason
[4590.58 → 4591.06] to have
[4591.06 → 4591.42] hope
[4591.42 → 4591.98] for the
[4591.98 → 4592.44] salvation
[4592.44 → 4592.94] of someone
[4592.94 → 4593.66] who doesn't
[4593.66 → 4593.92] yet
[4593.92 → 4594.50] believe
[4594.50 → 4596.46] let me
[4596.46 → 4596.76] say that
[4596.76 → 4596.94] again
[4596.94 → 4597.42] as long
[4597.42 → 4597.68] as it
[4597.68 → 4598.22] is today
[4598.22 → 4599.08] there is
[4599.08 → 4599.66] still a
[4599.66 → 4599.88] reason
[4599.88 → 4600.24] to have
[4600.24 → 4600.54] hope
[4600.54 → 4602.28] for the
[4602.28 → 4602.66] salvation
[4602.66 → 4603.08] of someone
[4603.08 → 4603.48] who doesn't
[4603.48 → 4603.66] yet
[4603.66 → 4604.04] believe
[4604.04 → 4605.26] which is
[4605.26 → 4605.60] Paul's
[4605.60 → 4606.02] second
[4606.02 → 4606.84] point
[4606.84 → 4607.10] right
[4607.10 → 4608.22] Paul
[4608.22 → 4609.08] hopes
[4609.08 → 4610.46] that the
[4610.46 → 4611.18] Gentile
[4611.18 → 4611.98] inclusion
[4611.98 → 4613.40] will now
[4613.40 → 4614.08] become
[4614.08 → 4615.32] the mechanism
[4615.32 → 4616.46] of Israel
[4616.46 → 4617.26] being awakened
[4617.26 → 4618.00] to belief
[4618.00 → 4618.96] look at
[4618.96 → 4619.24] look at
[4619.24 → 4619.82] verse 13
[4619.82 → 4622.24] this is
[4622.24 → 4622.50] I am
[4622.50 → 4622.92] talking to
[4622.92 → 4623.14] you
[4623.14 → 4623.78] Gentiles
[4623.78 → 4624.42] in as
[4624.42 → 4624.72] much
[4624.72 → 4625.16] as I
[4625.16 → 4625.42] am an
[4625.42 → 4625.76] apostle
[4625.76 → 4626.12] to the
[4626.12 → 4626.64] Gentiles
[4626.64 → 4627.00] I take
[4627.00 → 4627.46] pride
[4627.46 → 4627.82] in my
[4627.82 → 4628.26] ministry
[4628.26 → 4628.90] here
[4628.90 → 4629.20] here
[4629.20 → 4630.22] in the
[4630.22 → 4630.70] hope
[4630.70 → 4631.36] that I
[4631.36 → 4631.54] may
[4631.54 → 4632.04] somehow
[4632.04 → 4632.70] arouse
[4632.70 → 4633.26] my own
[4633.26 → 4633.58] people
[4633.58 → 4634.12] to envy
[4634.12 → 4634.90] and save
[4634.90 → 4635.64] some
[4635.64 → 4636.00] of them
[4636.00 → 4637.74] this
[4637.74 → 4638.08] actually
[4638.08 → 4638.58] is sort
[4638.58 → 4638.86] of the
[4638.86 → 4639.36] inverse
[4639.36 → 4640.56] of the
[4640.56 → 4640.94] previous
[4640.94 → 4641.44] point
[4641.44 → 4642.42] right
[4642.42 → 4643.30] Israel's
[4643.30 → 4643.70] rejection
[4643.70 → 4644.36] was the
[4644.36 → 4644.86] mechanism
[4644.86 → 4645.40] that God
[4645.40 → 4645.78] used
[4645.78 → 4646.16] to bring
[4646.16 → 4646.66] salvation
[4646.66 → 4647.04] to the
[4647.04 → 4647.58] Gentiles
[4647.58 → 4648.54] and now
[4648.54 → 4649.22] Paul
[4649.22 → 4649.86] hopes
[4649.86 → 4650.86] that the
[4650.86 → 4651.50] Gentile
[4651.50 → 4652.08] inclusion
[4652.08 → 4652.72] might be
[4652.72 → 4653.44] the mechanism
[4653.44 → 4654.10] that God
[4654.10 → 4654.74] uses to
[4654.74 → 4655.54] bring salvation
[4655.54 → 4656.46] to the
[4656.46 → 4656.78] Israelites
[4656.78 → 4657.34] who first
[4657.34 → 4658.22] rejected God
[4658.22 → 4659.14] in Jesus
[4659.14 → 4662.70] do you hear
[4662.70 → 4663.14] that right
[4663.14 → 4664.30] even
[4664.30 → 4664.84] their
[4664.84 → 4665.48] stumbling
[4665.48 → 4666.42] to believe
[4666.42 → 4667.26] can be
[4667.26 → 4667.78] used by
[4667.78 → 4668.18] God
[4668.18 → 4668.62] to bring
[4668.62 → 4669.04] life
[4669.04 → 4669.76] from the
[4669.76 → 4670.10] spiritual
[4670.10 → 4670.50] dead
[4670.50 → 4671.70] of Israel
[4671.70 → 4674.46] some of us
[4674.46 → 4674.76] need to hear
[4674.76 → 4675.14] that again
[4675.14 → 4676.94] God
[4676.94 → 4678.10] can
[4678.10 → 4679.00] use
[4679.00 → 4680.04] even
[4680.04 → 4681.06] one's
[4681.06 → 4681.66] own
[4681.66 → 4682.40] stumbling
[4682.40 → 4683.72] to believe
[4683.72 → 4685.38] God
[4685.38 → 4686.28] can use
[4686.28 → 4686.66] even
[4686.66 → 4687.08] one's
[4687.08 → 4687.36] own
[4687.36 → 4688.02] rejection
[4688.02 → 4688.98] as the
[4688.98 → 4689.44] means
[4689.44 → 4690.00] by which
[4690.00 → 4690.90] he draws
[4690.90 → 4691.84] that same
[4691.84 → 4692.38] one
[4692.38 → 4693.22] back to
[4693.22 → 4693.72] himself
[4693.72 → 4695.80] right
[4695.80 → 4696.16] that's
[4696.16 → 4696.56] Paul's
[4696.56 → 4696.82] point
[4696.82 → 4697.14] here
[4697.14 → 4697.52] right
[4697.52 → 4697.84] far
[4697.84 → 4698.10] from
[4698.10 → 4698.62] Israel's
[4698.62 → 4699.02] rejection
[4699.02 → 4699.60] of God
[4699.60 → 4699.98] meaning
[4699.98 → 4700.48] God's
[4700.48 → 4700.84] rejection
[4700.84 → 4701.42] of Israel
[4701.42 → 4702.08] God
[4702.08 → 4702.86] can use
[4702.86 → 4703.52] Israel's
[4703.52 → 4703.90] rejection
[4703.90 → 4704.38] of him
[4704.38 → 4704.78] as the
[4704.78 → 4705.00] very
[4705.00 → 4705.64] means
[4705.64 → 4706.10] by which
[4706.10 → 4706.48] he brings
[4706.48 → 4706.64] them
[4706.64 → 4707.06] back
[4707.06 → 4709.22] now I
[4709.22 → 4709.48] need you
[4709.48 → 4709.68] all to
[4709.68 → 4710.18] hear that
[4710.18 → 4711.16] because
[4711.16 → 4711.64] that's
[4711.64 → 4711.92] what it
[4711.92 → 4712.14] means
[4712.14 → 4712.42] to have
[4712.42 → 4712.80] a sovereign
[4712.80 → 4713.22] God
[4713.22 → 4714.78] that's
[4714.78 → 4715.06] what it
[4715.06 → 4715.44] means
[4715.44 → 4716.36] that God
[4716.36 → 4716.80] is
[4716.80 → 4717.48] God
[4717.48 → 4718.08] right
[4718.08 → 4718.70] that even
[4718.70 → 4719.40] the act
[4719.40 → 4719.94] of our
[4719.94 → 4720.56] rejecting
[4720.56 → 4720.96] him
[4720.96 → 4721.46] can be
[4721.46 → 4721.76] used
[4721.76 → 4722.26] by him
[4722.26 → 4722.62] as a
[4722.62 → 4722.94] means
[4722.94 → 4723.46] of
[4723.46 → 4723.88] acceptance
[4723.88 → 4725.44] and
[4725.44 → 4725.78] if that
[4725.78 → 4726.10] isn't
[4726.10 → 4726.44] proof
[4726.44 → 4727.00] of God's
[4727.00 → 4727.44] sovereignty
[4727.44 → 4727.98] and
[4727.98 → 4729.44] words
[4729.44 → 4729.92] fail me
[4729.92 → 4730.62] his utter
[4730.62 → 4731.44] goddess
[4731.44 → 4733.04] that I
[4733.04 → 4733.14] don't
[4733.14 → 4733.26] know
[4733.26 → 4733.40] what
[4733.40 → 4733.58] might
[4733.58 → 4733.80] be
[4733.80 → 4736.78] and
[4736.78 → 4737.00] then
[4737.00 → 4738.52] as we
[4738.52 → 4738.98] hear the
[4738.98 → 4739.40] sovereignty
[4739.40 → 4739.96] of God
[4739.96 → 4740.56] at work
[4740.56 → 4742.06] hear the
[4742.06 → 4742.48] hope
[4742.48 → 4743.54] and the
[4743.54 → 4744.08] comfort
[4744.08 → 4744.54] right
[4744.54 → 4744.88] that
[4744.88 → 4745.20] gives
[4745.20 → 4745.80] us
[4745.80 → 4746.32] right
[4746.32 → 4747.22] even
[4747.22 → 4748.10] someone's
[4748.10 → 4748.72] in the
[4748.72 → 4749.30] moment
[4749.30 → 4750.06] outright
[4750.06 → 4751.52] blatant
[4751.52 → 4752.28] arrogant
[4752.28 → 4752.98] rejection
[4752.98 → 4754.16] isn't
[4754.16 → 4754.74] enough
[4754.74 → 4755.42] for God
[4755.42 → 4756.22] to reject
[4756.22 → 4756.82] them
[4756.82 → 4760.04] let's
[4760.04 → 4760.26] make it
[4760.26 → 4760.58] personal
[4760.58 → 4761.48] your
[4761.48 → 4762.10] rejection
[4762.10 → 4763.26] can't
[4763.26 → 4764.84] your
[4764.84 → 4765.46] rejection
[4765.46 → 4766.44] cannot
[4766.44 → 4768.06] overrule
[4768.06 → 4768.58] God's
[4768.58 → 4769.14] purposes
[4769.14 → 4769.62] in
[4769.62 → 4770.40] election
[4770.40 → 4772.40] now
[4772.40 → 4774.18] let's
[4774.18 → 4774.60] slow down
[4774.60 → 4775.84] don't hear
[4775.84 → 4776.16] what I'm
[4776.16 → 4776.70] not saying
[4776.70 → 4778.32] right
[4778.32 → 4779.54] this isn't
[4779.54 → 4780.38] a guarantee
[4780.38 → 4781.64] that everyone
[4781.64 → 4782.22] who you
[4782.22 → 4782.74] know
[4782.74 → 4784.28] who looks
[4784.28 → 4784.92] like right
[4784.92 → 4785.42] now that
[4785.42 → 4785.80] they have
[4785.80 → 4786.22] rejected
[4786.22 → 4786.56] God
[4786.56 → 4787.08] this is
[4787.08 → 4787.58] not a
[4787.58 → 4787.90] guarantee
[4787.90 → 4788.50] that their
[4788.50 → 4788.96] rejection
[4788.96 → 4789.44] will be
[4789.44 → 4789.98] turned around
[4789.98 → 4790.32] into
[4790.32 → 4790.72] belief
[4790.72 → 4793.80] but I
[4793.80 → 4794.40] also can't
[4794.40 → 4794.82] say that
[4794.82 → 4795.44] God won't
[4795.44 → 4799.38] that he
[4799.38 → 4801.04] isn't
[4801.04 → 4801.32] going to
[4801.32 → 4801.74] do that
[4801.74 → 4803.24] I don't
[4803.24 → 4803.82] know what
[4803.82 → 4804.32] he will
[4804.32 → 4804.74] do
[4804.74 → 4806.42] but what
[4806.42 → 4807.00] I know
[4807.00 → 4807.78] is that
[4807.78 → 4808.10] he can
[4808.10 → 4808.62] do it
[4808.62 → 4810.72] and that's
[4810.72 → 4811.14] why we
[4811.14 → 4811.50] pray
[4811.50 → 4812.82] that's
[4812.82 → 4813.04] why
[4813.04 → 4813.28] we
[4813.28 → 4813.60] like
[4813.60 → 4814.14] Paul
[4814.14 → 4815.30] we pray
[4815.30 → 4815.72] and we
[4815.72 → 4816.10] plead
[4816.10 → 4816.66] with God
[4816.66 → 4817.96] to intercede
[4817.96 → 4818.60] in the lives
[4818.60 → 4819.24] of those
[4819.24 → 4819.72] people whom
[4819.72 → 4820.08] we know
[4820.08 → 4820.42] and whom
[4820.42 → 4820.72] we love
[4820.72 → 4821.44] that's why
[4821.44 → 4822.00] we preach
[4822.00 → 4822.52] the gospel
[4822.52 → 4823.40] over and
[4823.40 → 4823.94] over and
[4823.94 → 4824.56] over again
[4824.56 → 4825.12] because how
[4825.12 → 4825.46] can they
[4825.46 → 4826.00] believe in
[4826.00 → 4826.34] the one
[4826.34 → 4826.72] of whom
[4826.72 → 4827.12] they have
[4827.12 → 4827.58] not heard
[4827.58 → 4830.10] he did
[4830.10 → 4830.28] it with
[4830.28 → 4830.56] me
[4830.56 → 4832.84] he could
[4832.84 → 4833.02] do it
[4833.02 → 4833.30] with you
[4833.30 → 4835.30] he did
[4835.30 → 4835.48] it with
[4835.48 → 4835.80] you
[4835.80 → 4836.98] so he
[4836.98 → 4837.20] could do
[4837.20 → 4837.36] it with
[4837.36 → 4837.70] your brother
[4837.70 → 4839.48] he did
[4839.48 → 4839.66] it with
[4839.66 → 4839.94] her
[4839.94 → 4840.94] and so
[4840.94 → 4841.24] you better
[4841.24 → 4841.56] believe
[4841.56 → 4841.80] he can
[4841.80 → 4841.96] do it
[4841.96 → 4842.26] with them
[4842.26 → 4843.30] because
[4843.30 → 4843.70] that's
[4843.70 → 4843.94] what
[4843.94 → 4844.38] God
[4844.38 → 4845.22] does
[4845.22 → 4845.86] that's
[4845.86 → 4846.08] who
[4846.08 → 4846.64] God
[4846.64 → 4847.00] is
[4847.00 → 4847.34] he did
[4847.34 → 4847.52] it
[4847.52 → 4847.88] with
[4847.88 → 4848.02] the
[4848.02 → 4848.56] Gentiles
[4848.56 → 4848.86] he can
[4848.86 → 4849.20] do it
[4849.20 → 4849.56] with
[4849.56 → 4849.94] Israel
[4849.94 → 4850.60] he did
[4850.60 → 4850.78] it
[4850.78 → 4851.22] he can
[4851.22 → 4851.48] do it
[4851.48 → 4851.80] again
[4851.80 → 4852.52] that's
[4852.52 → 4853.12] the lesson
[4853.12 → 4853.76] that's
[4853.76 → 4854.26] the hope
[4854.26 → 4854.88] that's
[4854.88 → 4855.48] the comfort
[4855.48 → 4856.84] and that's
[4856.84 → 4857.26] exactly
[4857.26 → 4857.62] why
[4857.62 → 4858.00] Paul
[4858.00 → 4858.60] makes
[4858.60 → 4858.88] this
[4858.88 → 4859.20] point
[4859.20 → 4859.72] again
[4859.72 → 4860.36] this
[4860.36 → 4860.64] time
[4860.64 → 4860.80] with
[4860.80 → 4860.92] an
[4860.92 → 4861.56] illustration
[4861.56 → 4862.44] even
[4862.44 → 4863.00] as he
[4863.00 → 4863.48] shifts
[4863.48 → 4863.88] that
[4863.88 → 4864.20] through
[4864.20 → 4864.42] the
[4864.42 → 4864.96] illustration
[4864.96 → 4865.60] to
[4865.60 → 4866.24] application
[4866.24 → 4866.96] for us
[4866.96 → 4868.20] in verse
[4868.20 → 4868.68] 17
[4868.68 → 4871.04] if some
[4871.04 → 4871.30] of the
[4871.30 → 4871.62] branches
[4871.62 → 4872.08] have been
[4872.08 → 4872.36] broken
[4872.36 → 4872.82] off
[4872.82 → 4873.48] and you
[4873.48 → 4873.88] though
[4873.88 → 4874.56] a wild
[4874.56 → 4875.00] olive
[4875.00 → 4875.30] shoot
[4875.30 → 4875.72] have been
[4875.72 → 4876.16] grafted
[4876.16 → 4876.40] in
[4876.40 → 4876.66] among
[4876.66 → 4876.84] the
[4876.84 → 4877.18] others
[4877.18 → 4877.54] and now
[4877.54 → 4877.82] share
[4877.82 → 4878.04] in the
[4878.04 → 4878.32] nourishing
[4878.32 → 4878.60] sap
[4878.60 → 4878.92] from the
[4878.92 → 4879.20] olive
[4879.20 → 4879.44] root
[4879.44 → 4880.70] do not
[4880.70 → 4881.20] consider
[4881.20 → 4881.74] yourself
[4881.74 → 4882.14] to be
[4882.14 → 4882.72] superior
[4882.72 → 4883.84] to those
[4883.84 → 4884.48] other
[4884.48 → 4885.70] branches
[4885.70 → 4888.60] now here's
[4888.60 → 4888.92] the thing
[4888.92 → 4890.76] when it
[4890.76 → 4891.80] comes to
[4891.80 → 4892.60] faith
[4892.60 → 4893.72] and life
[4893.72 → 4895.68] there should
[4895.68 → 4896.40] be no
[4896.40 → 4896.86] such
[4896.86 → 4897.36] thing
[4897.36 → 4898.18] as a
[4898.18 → 4898.64] cocky
[4898.64 → 4899.10] Christian
[4899.10 → 4901.64] now you
[4901.64 → 4901.94] could be
[4901.94 → 4902.38] confident
[4902.38 → 4902.96] in Jesus
[4902.96 → 4904.26] and you
[4904.26 → 4904.70] can boast
[4904.70 → 4905.00] in the
[4905.00 → 4905.26] Lord
[4905.26 → 4906.70] but we
[4906.70 → 4907.00] should
[4907.00 → 4907.64] never
[4907.64 → 4908.44] appear
[4908.44 → 4909.26] haughty
[4909.26 → 4910.38] or conceited
[4910.38 → 4910.74] we should
[4910.74 → 4911.04] never
[4911.04 → 4911.46] appear
[4911.46 → 4912.28] proud
[4912.28 → 4913.04] and the
[4913.04 → 4913.72] fact that
[4913.72 → 4915.56] the criticism
[4915.56 → 4916.22] that exists
[4916.22 → 4916.92] of so many
[4916.92 → 4917.74] Christians
[4917.74 → 4918.12] in the
[4918.12 → 4918.34] world
[4918.34 → 4918.84] today
[4918.84 → 4919.72] the fact
[4919.72 → 4920.68] that people
[4920.68 → 4921.32] think of
[4921.32 → 4921.78] Christians
[4921.78 → 4922.16] and their
[4922.16 → 4922.58] automatic
[4922.58 → 4923.04] assumption
[4923.04 → 4923.38] is
[4923.38 → 4924.44] judgmental
[4924.44 → 4924.84] or some
[4924.84 → 4925.16] sort of
[4925.16 → 4926.08] like holier
[4926.08 → 4926.46] than thou
[4926.46 → 4926.84] attitude
[4926.84 → 4927.64] means
[4927.64 → 4928.58] that we
[4928.58 → 4929.74] haven't lived
[4929.74 → 4930.10] with the
[4930.10 → 4930.68] humility
[4930.68 → 4931.58] that our
[4931.58 → 4932.10] salvation
[4932.10 → 4932.76] by grace
[4932.76 → 4933.30] through faith
[4933.30 → 4933.90] requires
[4933.90 → 4934.64] of us
[4934.64 → 4937.36] but we
[4937.36 → 4937.94] have been
[4937.94 → 4939.00] proud
[4939.00 → 4941.22] or boastful
[4941.22 → 4944.20] one person
[4944.20 → 4945.00] I read
[4945.00 → 4945.48] this week
[4945.48 → 4946.54] summarized it
[4946.54 → 4946.84] like this
[4946.84 → 4947.18] and I'm
[4947.18 → 4947.74] paraphrasing
[4947.74 → 4948.20] they say
[4948.20 → 4949.64] though Israel
[4949.64 → 4950.46] was God's
[4950.46 → 4951.40] chosen people
[4951.40 → 4952.10] they began
[4952.10 → 4952.76] to act
[4952.76 → 4953.40] and think
[4953.40 → 4953.94] like they
[4953.94 → 4954.72] were choice
[4954.72 → 4955.58] people
[4955.58 → 4957.72] that is
[4957.72 → 4958.14] they became
[4958.14 → 4958.68] confident
[4958.68 → 4959.26] that no matter
[4959.26 → 4959.78] how they
[4959.78 → 4960.16] lived
[4960.16 → 4960.56] or what
[4960.56 → 4961.18] they did
[4961.18 → 4962.78] that it
[4962.78 → 4963.24] didn't matter
[4963.24 → 4963.90] they had
[4963.90 → 4964.38] forgotten
[4964.38 → 4965.24] that being
[4965.24 → 4965.84] chosen
[4965.84 → 4966.74] comes with
[4966.74 → 4967.56] an identity
[4967.56 → 4968.78] and with
[4968.78 → 4969.82] a responsibility
[4969.82 → 4972.46] in Romans
[4972.46 → 4972.88] 12
[4972.88 → 4973.58] Paul is
[4973.58 → 4974.44] going to
[4974.44 → 4974.70] say
[4974.70 → 4976.00] for by the
[4976.00 → 4976.56] grace given
[4976.56 → 4977.26] me I say
[4977.26 → 4977.68] to every
[4977.68 → 4978.10] one of you
[4978.10 → 4978.64] do not
[4978.64 → 4979.20] think of
[4979.20 → 4979.64] yourself
[4979.64 → 4980.32] more highly
[4980.32 → 4981.02] than you
[4981.02 → 4981.24] ought
[4981.24 → 4981.76] but rather
[4981.76 → 4982.24] think of
[4982.24 → 4982.58] yourself
[4982.58 → 4983.16] with sober
[4983.16 → 4983.58] judgment
[4983.58 → 4984.46] in accordance
[4984.46 → 4984.92] with the
[4984.92 → 4985.44] faith God
[4985.44 → 4986.04] has distributed
[4986.04 → 4986.50] to each
[4986.50 → 4986.84] of you
[4986.84 → 4987.84] to the
[4987.84 → 4988.48] Philippians
[4988.48 → 4989.44] Paul says
[4989.44 → 4990.48] do nothing
[4990.48 → 4991.38] out of selfish
[4991.38 → 4991.92] ambition
[4991.92 → 4992.50] or vain
[4992.50 → 4993.12] conceit
[4993.12 → 4993.96] rather in
[4993.96 → 4994.70] humility
[4994.70 → 4995.86] value others
[4995.86 → 4996.66] above yourselves
[4996.66 → 4997.24] not looking
[4997.24 → 4997.76] to your own
[4997.76 → 4998.20] interests
[4998.20 → 4998.70] but each
[4998.70 → 4999.02] of you
[4999.02 → 4999.70] to the
[4999.70 → 5000.14] interests
[5000.14 → 5000.74] of others
[5000.74 → 5004.66] Paul is
[5004.66 → 5005.18] saying
[5005.18 → 5006.10] to the
[5006.10 → 5007.10] Gentile
[5007.10 → 5007.70] audience
[5007.70 → 5008.64] reading this
[5008.64 → 5008.96] letter
[5008.96 → 5009.56] and let's
[5009.56 → 5010.22] be clear
[5010.22 → 5011.20] 2,000
[5011.20 → 5011.62] years later
[5011.62 → 5011.86] that's
[5011.86 → 5012.36] us
[5012.36 → 5014.26] he's
[5014.26 → 5014.38] saying
[5014.38 → 5014.82] don't
[5014.82 → 5015.10] be
[5015.10 → 5015.44] that
[5015.44 → 5015.78] way
[5015.78 → 5017.38] right
[5017.38 → 5017.96] faith
[5017.96 → 5018.38] is
[5018.38 → 5018.68] not
[5018.68 → 5019.04] that
[5019.04 → 5019.96] presumption
[5019.96 → 5020.70] instead
[5020.70 → 5021.30] he says
[5021.30 → 5022.04] continue
[5022.04 → 5022.46] in
[5022.46 → 5022.82] God's
[5022.82 → 5023.20] kindness
[5023.20 → 5024.56] and make

[5093.10 → 5093.28] start
[5093.28 → 5093.46] to
[5093.46 → 5093.90] wonder
[5093.90 → 5094.34] in
[5094.34 → 5094.96] ourselves
[5094.96 → 5095.40] if
[5095.40 → 5096.26] God's
[5096.26 → 5096.68] kindness
[5096.68 → 5097.26] is
[5097.26 → 5097.92] still
[5097.92 → 5098.24] on
[5098.24 → 5098.38] us
[5098.38 → 5098.54] or
[5098.54 → 5098.80] if
[5098.80 → 5099.08] it
[5099.08 → 5099.42] ever
[5099.42 → 5100.38] was
[5100.38 → 5101.10] or
[5101.10 → 5102.34] are
[5102.34 → 5102.48] we
[5102.48 → 5102.74] maybe
[5102.74 → 5103.38] hiding
[5103.38 → 5104.40] in
[5104.40 → 5104.56] our
[5104.56 → 5105.00] rejection
[5105.00 → 5105.82] of
[5105.82 → 5106.00] him
[5106.00 → 5107.38] right
[5107.38 → 5107.70] how
[5107.70 → 5108.00] you
[5108.00 → 5108.70] live
[5108.70 → 5109.76] reveals
[5109.76 → 5110.16] the
[5110.16 → 5110.82] truth
[5110.82 → 5111.54] of
[5111.54 → 5111.88] your
[5111.88 → 5112.52] profession
[5112.52 → 5113.92] and
[5113.92 → 5114.00] so
[5114.00 → 5114.14] when
[5114.14 → 5114.34] you
[5114.34 → 5114.78] say
[5114.78 → 5115.24] Jesus
[5115.24 → 5115.58] is
[5115.58 → 5115.92] Lord
[5115.92 → 5116.14] and
[5116.14 → 5116.38] God
[5116.38 → 5116.76] raised
[5116.76 → 5116.98] him
[5116.98 → 5117.20] from
[5117.20 → 5117.34] the
[5117.34 → 5117.66] dead
[5117.66 → 5118.18] that
[5118.18 → 5118.72] changes
[5118.72 → 5119.54] everything
[5119.54 → 5120.30] about
[5120.30 → 5120.80] what
[5120.80 → 5121.34] and
[5121.34 → 5121.72] who
[5121.72 → 5122.14] you
[5122.14 → 5122.66] live
[5122.66 → 5122.96] for
[5122.96 → 5124.54] and
[5124.54 → 5124.70] if
[5124.70 → 5124.88] it's
[5124.88 → 5125.30] real
[5125.30 → 5126.08] it's
[5126.08 → 5126.34] going
[5126.34 → 5126.48] to
[5126.48 → 5126.72] show
[5126.72 → 5126.92] up
[5126.92 → 5127.10] in
[5127.10 → 5127.24] your
[5127.24 → 5127.68] life
[5127.68 → 5128.92] and
[5128.92 → 5129.02] that
[5129.02 → 5129.18] doesn't
[5129.18 → 5129.30] mean
[5129.30 → 5129.46] we're
[5129.46 → 5129.58] going to
[5129.58 → 5129.72] be
[5129.72 → 5130.08] perfect
[5130.08 → 5130.40] far
[5130.40 → 5131.02] from
[5131.02 → 5131.14] it
[5131.14 → 5131.26] but
[5131.26 → 5131.40] it
[5131.40 → 5131.66] does
[5131.66 → 5132.04] mean
[5132.04 → 5132.56] that
[5132.56 → 5132.72] we
[5132.72 → 5132.90] will
[5132.90 → 5133.22] see
[5133.22 → 5133.94] growth
[5133.94 → 5134.18] in
[5134.18 → 5134.48] things
[5134.48 → 5134.68] like
[5134.68 → 5134.84] the
[5134.84 → 5135.10] fruit
[5135.10 → 5135.70] of
[5135.70 → 5135.84] the
[5135.84 → 5136.08] spirit
[5136.08 → 5137.10] it
[5137.10 → 5137.34] does
[5137.34 → 5137.60] mean
[5137.60 → 5137.76] that
[5137.76 → 5137.88] you
[5137.88 → 5138.04] will
[5138.04 → 5138.38] see
[5138.38 → 5139.30] developing
[5139.30 → 5139.72] in
[5139.72 → 5140.32] patience
[5140.32 → 5140.82] and

[5142.22 → 5142.78] and
[5142.78 → 5143.54] gentleness
[5143.54 → 5145.66] does
[5145.66 → 5146.06] mean
[5146.06 → 5146.92] that
[5146.92 → 5147.02] we
[5147.02 → 5147.14] will
[5147.14 → 5147.26] get
[5147.26 → 5147.42] a
[5147.42 → 5147.78] handle
[5147.78 → 5148.14] on
[5148.14 → 5148.30] our
[5148.30 → 5148.64] self
[5148.64 → 5149.20] control
[5149.20 → 5149.78] over
[5149.78 → 5150.56] a
[5150.56 → 5150.88] period
[5150.88 → 5151.50] of
[5151.50 → 5151.64] a
[5151.64 → 5152.02] lifetime
[5152.02 → 5152.52] or
[5152.52 → 5152.68] a
[5152.68 → 5153.00] period
[5153.00 → 5153.46] of
[5153.46 → 5153.58] a
[5153.58 → 5153.88] time
[5153.88 → 5154.14] because
[5154.14 → 5154.48] the
[5154.48 → 5154.88] Holy
[5154.88 → 5155.34] Spirit
[5155.34 → 5156.00] makes
[5156.00 → 5156.46] that
[5156.46 → 5157.32] possible
[5157.32 → 5159.90] now
[5159.90 → 5160.20] to sum
[5160.20 → 5160.44] it all
[5160.44 → 5160.74] up
[5160.74 → 5163.38] and to
[5163.38 → 5163.72] come back
[5163.72 → 5163.94] to the
[5163.94 → 5164.20] beginning
[5164.20 → 5165.48] this
[5165.48 → 5166.04] chapter
[5166.04 → 5167.02] really
[5167.02 → 5167.62] is
[5167.62 → 5168.00] an
[5168.00 → 5169.34] exaltation
[5169.34 → 5170.30] of
[5170.30 → 5170.68] a
[5170.68 → 5171.14] sovereign
[5171.14 → 5171.94] God
[5171.94 → 5173.04] and
[5173.04 → 5173.24] it
[5173.24 → 5173.66] paints
[5173.66 → 5173.90] a
[5173.90 → 5174.16] picture
[5174.16 → 5174.42] for
[5174.42 → 5174.66] us
[5174.66 → 5174.86] of
[5174.86 → 5175.00] a
[5175.00 → 5175.34] God
[5175.34 → 5175.52] who
[5175.52 → 5175.76] is
[5175.76 → 5176.20] God
[5176.20 → 5176.38] and
[5176.38 → 5176.54] whose
[5176.54 → 5177.26] purposes
[5177.26 → 5177.62] in
[5177.62 → 5178.10] creating
[5178.10 → 5178.60] and
[5178.60 → 5179.06] redeeming
[5179.06 → 5179.16] the
[5179.16 → 5179.36] world
[5179.36 → 5179.60] whose
[5179.60 → 5180.08] purpose
[5180.08 → 5180.36] in
[5180.36 → 5180.96] election
[5180.96 → 5181.78] cannot
[5181.78 → 5182.42] be
[5182.42 → 5183.22] thwarted
[5183.22 → 5183.86] even
[5183.86 → 5184.32] our
[5184.32 → 5184.88] rejection
[5184.88 → 5185.10] of
[5185.10 → 5185.44] him
[5185.44 → 5185.76] is
[5185.76 → 5186.00] not
[5186.00 → 5186.42] enough
[5186.42 → 5186.62] for
[5186.62 → 5186.86] him
[5186.86 → 5187.36] to
[5187.36 → 5187.88] reject
[5187.88 → 5188.66] us
[5188.66 → 5190.34] in
[5190.34 → 5190.78] fact
[5190.78 → 5192.62] that
[5192.62 → 5192.84] is
[5192.84 → 5193.08] the
[5193.08 → 5193.46] heart
[5193.46 → 5194.20] and
[5194.20 → 5194.42] the
[5194.42 → 5194.94] majesty
[5194.94 → 5196.02] of
[5196.02 → 5196.18] the
[5196.18 → 5196.60] gospel
[5196.60 → 5198.22] that
[5198.22 → 5198.38] there
[5198.38 → 5198.62] is
[5198.62 → 5199.04] nothing
[5199.04 → 5199.30] that
[5199.30 → 5199.54] I
[5199.54 → 5199.72] can
[5199.72 → 5199.96] do
[5199.96 → 5200.18] to
[5200.18 → 5200.52] gain
[5200.52 → 5201.38] salvation
[5201.38 → 5201.76] which
[5201.76 → 5202.10] means
[5202.10 → 5202.40] there is
[5202.40 → 5202.72] nothing
[5202.72 → 5202.96] that
[5202.96 → 5203.16] I
[5203.16 → 5203.34] can
[5203.34 → 5203.68] do
[5203.68 → 5204.12] to
[5204.12 → 5204.44] lose
[5204.44 → 5204.68] it
[5204.68 → 5206.08] Jesus
[5206.08 → 5206.52] lived
[5206.52 → 5206.66] the
[5206.66 → 5206.90] life
[5206.90 → 5207.06] I
[5207.06 → 5207.22] should
[5207.22 → 5207.36] have
[5207.36 → 5207.66] lived
[5207.66 → 5207.78] and
[5207.78 → 5208.34] now
[5208.34 → 5208.58] I
[5208.58 → 5208.72] am
[5208.72 → 5209.18] clothed
[5209.18 → 5209.28] in
[5209.28 → 5209.46] his
[5209.46 → 5209.94] righteousness
[5209.94 → 5210.26] and
[5210.26 → 5210.42] that
[5210.42 → 5211.00] can't
[5211.00 → 5211.18] be
[5211.18 → 5211.50] taken
[5211.50 → 5211.90] away
[5211.90 → 5212.52] Jesus
[5212.52 → 5212.92] died
[5212.92 → 5213.08] the
[5213.08 → 5213.32] death
[5213.32 → 5213.48] that
[5213.48 → 5213.64] I
[5213.64 → 5214.04] deserved
[5214.04 → 5214.40] paying
[5214.40 → 5214.62] the
[5214.62 → 5214.94] price
[5214.94 → 5215.14] for
[5215.14 → 5215.28] the
[5215.28 → 5215.60] curse
[5215.60 → 5216.08] which
[5216.08 → 5216.26] is
[5216.26 → 5216.58] death
[5216.58 → 5217.28] death
[5217.28 → 5217.86] dies
[5217.86 → 5218.70] by
[5218.70 → 5218.90] the
[5218.90 → 5219.42] deathless
[5219.42 → 5219.78] one
[5219.78 → 5220.24] dying
[5220.24 → 5220.48] on
[5220.48 → 5220.62] a
[5220.62 → 5220.92] cross
[5220.92 → 5221.48] taking
[5221.48 → 5221.72] the
[5221.72 → 5222.20] punishment
[5222.20 → 5222.68] for
[5222.68 → 5222.94] my
[5222.94 → 5223.20] sin
[5223.20 → 5224.72] this
[5224.72 → 5225.30] is
[5225.30 → 5225.70] how
[5225.70 → 5226.14] those
[5226.14 → 5226.32] of
[5226.32 → 5226.54] us
[5226.54 → 5226.76] who
[5226.76 → 5227.36] believe
[5227.36 → 5227.88] are
[5227.88 → 5228.38] declared
[5228.38 → 5229.44] righteous

[5232.14 → 5232.52] and
[5232.52 → 5232.86] death
[5232.86 → 5233.18] is
[5233.18 → 5233.46] the
[5233.46 → 5234.18] ultimate
[5234.18 → 5235.24] mechanism
[5235.24 → 5235.82] of
[5235.82 → 5236.28] our
[5236.28 → 5237.40] salvation
[5237.40 → 5239.40] it
[5239.40 → 5239.52] was
[5239.52 → 5240.26] always
[5240.26 → 5241.26] God's
[5241.26 → 5241.94] sovereign
[5241.94 → 5242.92] plan
[5242.92 → 5245.08] it's
[5245.08 → 5245.22] true
[5245.22 → 5245.44] for
[5245.44 → 5245.80] us
[5245.80 → 5247.56] and
[5247.56 → 5247.76] it's
[5247.76 → 5248.00] true
[5248.00 → 5248.22] for
[5248.22 → 5248.36] the
[5248.36 → 5248.78] Israel
[5248.78 → 5249.00] who
[5249.00 → 5249.48] rejected
[5249.48 → 5249.76] him
[5249.76 → 5250.02] all
[5250.02 → 5250.28] those

[5258.34 → 5258.78] that is
[5258.78 → 5259.26] Israel
[5259.26 → 5259.92] do not
[5259.92 → 5260.52] persist
[5260.52 → 5260.88] in
[5260.88 → 5261.68] unbelief
[5261.68 → 5262.12] they

[5262.38 → 5262.58] be
[5262.58 → 5263.16] grafted
[5263.16 → 5263.46] in

[5265.42 → 5265.68] them
[5265.68 → 5265.98] in
[5265.98 → 5266.40] again
[5266.40 → 5268.12] after
[5268.12 → 5268.42] all
[5268.42 → 5268.62] if
[5268.62 → 5268.74] you
[5268.74 → 5268.90] were
[5268.90 → 5269.10] cut
[5269.10 → 5269.40] off
[5269.40 → 5269.52] of
[5269.52 → 5269.64] an
[5269.64 → 5269.90] olive
[5269.90 → 5270.18] tree
[5270.18 → 5270.36] that
[5270.36 → 5270.50] is
[5270.50 → 5270.84] wild
[5270.84 → 5271.08] by
[5271.08 → 5271.42] nature

[5272.78 → 5273.18] grafted
[5273.18 → 5273.38] into
[5273.38 → 5273.60] a
[5273.60 → 5274.00] cultivated
[5274.00 → 5274.38] olive
[5274.38 → 5274.64] tree
[5274.64 → 5274.96] how
[5274.96 → 5275.28] much
[5275.28 → 5275.56] more
[5275.56 → 5275.94] readily
[5275.94 → 5276.30] will
[5276.30 → 5276.80] these
[5276.80 → 5277.36] the

[5277.86 → 5278.36] branches
[5278.36 → 5278.74] be
[5278.74 → 5279.22] grafted
[5279.22 → 5279.58] into
[5279.58 → 5279.84] their

[5280.26 → 5281.10] olive
[5281.10 → 5281.46] tree
[5281.46 → 5284.52] now
[5284.52 → 5284.96] as we
[5284.96 → 5286.16] continue
[5286.16 → 5286.98] the
[5286.98 → 5287.64] analogy
[5287.64 → 5288.28] here
[5288.28 → 5288.60] of
[5288.60 → 5289.72] between
[5289.72 → 5290.32] Israel
[5290.32 → 5291.86] and
[5291.86 → 5292.30] those
[5292.30 → 5292.86] of our
[5292.86 → 5293.28] sons
[5293.28 → 5293.58] and
[5293.58 → 5293.90] daughters
[5293.90 → 5294.32] of our
[5294.32 → 5294.74] friends
[5294.74 → 5295.70] and family
[5295.70 → 5296.10] who were
[5296.10 → 5296.50] once
[5296.50 → 5296.98] part
[5296.98 → 5297.34] of
[5297.34 → 5297.66] us
[5297.66 → 5297.82] who
[5297.82 → 5298.10] once
[5298.10 → 5299.18] professed
[5299.18 → 5299.42] faith
[5299.42 → 5299.90] but now
[5299.90 → 5300.42] for whatever
[5300.42 → 5300.84] reason
[5300.84 → 5301.66] don't
[5301.66 → 5302.12] but now
[5302.12 → 5302.72] live a
[5302.72 → 5303.04] life
[5303.04 → 5303.90] of
[5303.90 → 5304.40] rejection
[5304.40 → 5304.68] whether
[5304.68 → 5304.96] it's
[5304.96 → 5305.36] implicit
[5305.36 → 5305.74] or
[5305.74 → 5306.28] explicit
[5306.28 → 5306.64] whether
[5306.64 → 5306.90] it's
[5306.90 → 5307.34] active
[5307.34 → 5307.68] or
[5307.68 → 5308.68] passive
[5308.68 → 5311.26] hear the
[5311.26 → 5311.58] hope
[5311.58 → 5314.44] it could
[5314.44 → 5315.20] be so
[5315.20 → 5316.10] easy
[5316.10 → 5317.52] for God
[5317.52 → 5317.96] to
[5317.96 → 5318.60] graft
[5318.60 → 5319.02] them
[5319.02 → 5319.72] back
[5319.72 → 5320.40] in
[5320.40 → 5321.86] because
[5321.86 → 5322.18] he's a
[5322.18 → 5322.40] sovereign
[5322.40 → 5322.74] God
[5322.74 → 5323.96] and
[5323.96 → 5324.16] that's
[5324.16 → 5324.30] what
[5324.30 → 5324.40] he
[5324.40 → 5324.70] does
[5324.70 → 5325.24] for
[5325.24 → 5325.48] God
[5325.48 → 5325.64] to
[5325.64 → 5325.84] turn
[5325.84 → 5326.14] their
[5326.14 → 5326.76] rejection
[5326.76 → 5327.66] and
[5327.66 → 5327.82] their
[5327.82 → 5328.44] unbelief
[5328.44 → 5328.94] into
[5328.94 → 5329.96] belief
[5329.96 → 5330.76] he
[5330.76 → 5330.96] can
[5330.96 → 5331.16] do
[5331.16 → 5331.58] it
[5331.58 → 5334.76] now
[5334.76 → 5334.98] like
[5334.98 → 5335.30] you
[5335.30 → 5336.32] I
[5336.32 → 5336.52] have
[5336.52 → 5336.90] people
[5336.90 → 5337.14] in
[5337.14 → 5337.32] my
[5337.32 → 5337.82] life
[5337.82 → 5339.06] for
[5339.06 → 5339.52] whom
[5339.52 → 5340.48] I
[5340.48 → 5341.32] need
[5341.32 → 5341.78] this
[5341.78 → 5342.40] to be
[5342.40 → 5342.76] true
[5342.76 → 5343.28] of
[5343.28 → 5343.68] God
[5343.68 → 5344.28] and
[5344.28 → 5344.38] of
[5344.38 → 5344.50] what
[5344.50 → 5344.60] he
[5344.60 → 5344.80] does
[5344.80 → 5344.90] in
[5344.90 → 5345.00] the
[5345.00 → 5345.22] world
[5345.22 → 5347.20] like

[5347.60 → 5348.04] right
[5348.04 → 5348.20] and
[5348.20 → 5348.58] like
[5348.58 → 5348.88] all
[5348.88 → 5349.10] of
[5349.10 → 5349.42] us
[5349.42 → 5349.94] we
[5349.94 → 5350.34] have
[5350.34 → 5351.04] people
[5351.04 → 5351.36] in
[5351.36 → 5351.56] our
[5351.56 → 5352.04] lives
[5352.04 → 5352.20] who
[5352.20 → 5352.72] this
[5352.72 → 5353.18] is
[5353.18 → 5353.42] the
[5353.42 → 5353.72] only
[5353.72 → 5354.02] hope
[5354.02 → 5354.14] that
[5354.14 → 5354.26] we
[5354.26 → 5354.48] have
[5354.48 → 5354.82] left
[5354.82 → 5355.36] this
[5355.36 → 5355.72] is

[5364.36 → 5365.30] can
[5365.30 → 5366.04] do
[5366.04 → 5366.36] it
[5366.36 → 5367.16] because
[5367.16 → 5367.50] God
[5367.50 → 5367.74] is
[5367.74 → 5368.16] God
[5368.16 → 5368.68] and
[5368.68 → 5369.02] God
[5369.02 → 5369.62] is
[5369.62 → 5370.28] sovereign
[5370.28 → 5371.40] now

[5380.34 → 5380.72] of
[5380.72 → 5381.22] rejection
[5381.22 → 5381.58] or
