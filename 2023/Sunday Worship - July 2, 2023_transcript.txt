[0.00 --> 14.66]  Yeah, totally.
[30.00 --> 50.00]  Yes.
[50.00 --> 62.00]  Yes.
[62.00 --> 81.86]  Good morning.
[81.86 --> 82.12]  Good morning.
[83.12 --> 86.12]  Welcome into worship this morning.
[86.12 --> 116.10]  Good morning.
[116.12 --> 122.08]  We're grateful for the opportunity for a bunch of teenagers from our church to go and camp
[122.08 --> 124.66]  our cabin, I guess, together this weekend.
[125.30 --> 126.92]  I heard from Pastor Kevin this morning.
[127.12 --> 132.84]  They had an excellent weekend and are starting to pack up now and the like.
[133.58 --> 135.66]  We also have an announcement this morning from Emo.
[135.92 --> 138.50]  So I'm going to get Emo to come up to the front.
[138.50 --> 147.54]  As he's making his way up to the front, I just want to remind you that in a week's time, we'll
[147.54 --> 149.40]  be having kids camp here.
[149.40 --> 156.34]  And so that's for kids age three through, Carolyn, what's the top number?
[156.78 --> 157.22]  Seven.
[157.42 --> 157.86]  Thank you.
[158.44 --> 160.20]  And we need some help getting that ready.
[160.70 --> 167.52]  And so if you are available this Thursday at 1 p.m. to help set up and do some decorating,
[167.98 --> 169.70]  Carolyn and the team would love that.
[170.04 --> 171.72]  If you have questions, you can talk to Carolyn.
[171.88 --> 172.88]  Carolyn's going to raise her hand.
[172.88 --> 173.98]  That's who you talk to.
[174.10 --> 174.54]  Very good.
[175.16 --> 179.96]  And then as well, in the e-bulletin, there are some other opportunities to sign up to volunteer
[179.96 --> 180.72]  there too.
[180.80 --> 183.48]  So if you have questions about that, you can direct them at Carolyn.
[183.54 --> 187.02]  But I want to encourage you to sign up for those volunteer opportunities.
[187.66 --> 188.10]  Emo, go ahead.
[188.94 --> 189.42]  Good morning.
[190.32 --> 197.22]  Just a reminder that the Emanuel Food Bank drive starts next Sunday, July 9th.
[197.22 --> 204.84]  When we hand out the empty grocery bags to our neighbors in Murrayville, the grocery bags
[204.84 --> 210.82]  will be handed out in the foyer after the service next Sunday.
[211.80 --> 219.82]  This drive is an important event for the Langley Food Bank because this time of the year is when
[219.82 --> 221.64]  they get the least amount of donations.
[221.64 --> 226.94]  We encourage everyone in the church to participate next Sunday.
[227.92 --> 236.28]  Then on Saturday, July 15th, the full bags will be returned to the church by our neighbors
[236.28 --> 240.24]  where we will have a pancake breakfast and kids' fair.
[241.04 --> 243.94]  We still need some volunteers for Saturday.
[243.94 --> 254.64]  We encourage you to sign up at the back in the foyer after the service or online the e-bulletin.
[256.86 --> 264.18]  I encourage you to participate in this worthwhile cause for the poor in our community for Jesus' sake.
[264.92 --> 265.52]  Thank you.
[265.68 --> 266.42]  Have a great Sunday.
[266.42 --> 277.78]  As well as we are rolling into our summer season and schedule here,
[278.32 --> 281.24]  children's worship time changes a little bit,
[281.36 --> 286.46]  and it's for the preschooler and kindergarten-aged kids, so three to five,
[287.02 --> 291.64]  and they will go out during our regular worship time together
[291.64 --> 295.06]  and be met with special teachers and special helpers.
[295.06 --> 299.34]  We have a special volunteer schedule for that that we need to fill out,
[299.82 --> 304.38]  and so there's a few spaces left for teachers and for helpers,
[304.56 --> 309.06]  and so we encourage you, again, in the e-bulletin there's a sign-up list there,
[309.78 --> 314.52]  or you can, if there's someone at the back table there, the children's worship time check-in,
[314.58 --> 316.22]  you can ask them about that.
[317.42 --> 319.78]  Lastly, following our worship this morning,
[319.78 --> 323.52]  about 15 to 20 minutes after our service,
[323.52 --> 329.36]  I'm going to lead a discussion and recap of Synod 2023,
[329.96 --> 334.56]  and so Synod is the annual gathering of Christian Reformed churches and leaders
[334.56 --> 339.06]  where they make some decisions about theology and direction for the church.
[339.58 --> 341.52]  They met earlier in June,
[341.52 --> 346.04]  and so to just share what happened in that meeting and what took place,
[346.50 --> 348.52]  we will gather in the multi-purpose room,
[348.60 --> 354.34]  and then I'll walk you through the decisions and the events of that time and week together.
[354.50 --> 356.84]  And so I encourage you, following service today,
[356.94 --> 360.58]  to meet in the multi-purpose room 15 or 20 minutes afterwards,
[360.68 --> 361.88]  so you have time to grab a coffee,
[362.34 --> 362.84]  some other refreshments,
[363.50 --> 364.62]  and then we'll gather together.
[364.96 --> 366.08]  If you have any questions about that,
[366.18 --> 367.20]  you can grab me beforehand.
[367.20 --> 369.38]  I believe that's it.
[369.64 --> 370.90]  And so I'm going to ask, as you're able,
[371.04 --> 371.90]  if you would stand,
[372.60 --> 374.68]  and we're welcomed into God's presence together.
[378.66 --> 382.52]  We are welcomed by God in this space
[382.52 --> 385.32]  as He meets us here for worship,
[385.50 --> 387.92]  and so we receive His greeting.
[388.98 --> 391.96]  Grace, mercy, and peace to you
[391.96 --> 393.42]  from God our Father,
[393.54 --> 394.66]  from the Lord Jesus Christ,
[394.76 --> 395.86]  His Son and our Savior,
[395.86 --> 398.78]  through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[399.86 --> 400.32]  Amen.
[401.02 --> 403.06]  I'm going to invite you to turn to those around you
[403.06 --> 405.02]  and welcome them into worship this morning.
[417.02 --> 417.50]  Robin.
[420.00 --> 420.48]  Adrian.
[420.86 --> 421.18]  Sarah.
[421.18 --> 421.30]  Sarah.
[425.86 --> 440.00]  As we begin our worship this morning,
[440.28 --> 443.50]  let's give thanks to the Lord our God
[443.50 --> 446.78]  and reflect on this passage from Psalm 100.
[448.12 --> 450.38]  Enter His gates with thanksgiving
[450.38 --> 452.66]  and His courts with praise.
[452.66 --> 455.72]  Give thanks to Him and praise His name.
[456.30 --> 457.78]  For the Lord is good
[457.78 --> 459.82]  and His love endures forever.
[460.54 --> 463.98]  His faithfulness continues throughout all generations.
[463.98 --> 471.86]  I will worship.
[471.86 --> 487.52]  I will worship.
[487.52 --> 488.52]  I will worship.
[488.52 --> 489.52]  I will worship.
[489.52 --> 492.52]  With all of my heart.
[492.52 --> 494.52]  With all of my heart.
[494.52 --> 495.52]  With all of my heart.
[495.52 --> 498.64]  I will praise you.
[498.64 --> 500.90]  I will praise you.
[500.90 --> 503.52]  With all of my strength.
[503.52 --> 505.64]  All my strength.
[505.64 --> 508.52]  I will seek you.
[508.52 --> 511.78]  I will seek you.
[511.78 --> 513.78]  All of my days.
[513.78 --> 514.78]  All of my days.
[514.78 --> 516.78]  All of my days.
[516.78 --> 518.78]  I will follow.
[518.78 --> 519.78]  I will follow.
[519.78 --> 521.78]  I will follow.
[521.78 --> 523.78]  All of your ways.
[523.78 --> 524.78]  All of your ways.
[524.78 --> 526.78]  All of your ways.
[526.78 --> 531.78]  I will give you all my worship.
[531.78 --> 538.78]  I will give you all my praise.
[538.78 --> 543.78]  You alone are long to worship.
[543.78 --> 548.78]  You alone are worthy of my praise.
[548.78 --> 549.78]  Your head will bow down.
[549.78 --> 551.78]  I will bow down.
[551.78 --> 552.78]  I will bow down.
[552.78 --> 555.78]  And hail you as King.
[555.78 --> 558.78]  Hail and sing.
[558.78 --> 561.78]  I will serve you.
[561.78 --> 563.78]  I will serve you.
[563.78 --> 565.78]  Give you everything.
[565.78 --> 569.78]  Give you everything.
[569.78 --> 571.78]  I will lift up.
[571.78 --> 573.78]  I will lift up.
[573.78 --> 576.78]  My eyes to your throne.
[576.78 --> 579.78]  I will trust you.
[579.78 --> 581.78]  I will trust you.
[581.78 --> 584.78]  I will trust you.
[584.78 --> 586.78]  Trust you alone.
[586.78 --> 590.78]  Trust me in your life.
[590.78 --> 595.78]  I will give you all my worship.
[595.78 --> 600.78]  I will give you all my praise.
[600.78 --> 605.78]  You alone I long to worship.
[605.78 --> 611.78]  You alone are worthy of my praise.
[611.78 --> 613.78]  I will give you all my worship.
[613.78 --> 615.78]  I will give you all my praise.
[615.78 --> 616.78]  I will give you all my praise.
[616.78 --> 618.78]  You alone I long to worship.
[618.78 --> 622.78]  You alone are worthy of my praise.
[622.78 --> 627.78]  You alone I long to worship.
[627.78 --> 635.78]  You alone are worthy of my praise.
[635.78 --> 646.78]  You alone I love you.
[646.78 --> 648.78]  You are worthy of love as King us.
[648.78 --> 650.78]  You alone I love you.
[650.78 --> 652.78]  I will eat every song you could ever sing.
[652.78 --> 659.78]  Worthy of every song we could ever sing
[659.78 --> 666.78]  Worthy of every praise we could ever bring
[666.78 --> 673.78]  Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
[673.78 --> 679.78]  Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
[679.78 --> 690.78]  Jesus the name above every other name
[690.78 --> 697.78]  Jesus the name we want who could ever sing
[697.78 --> 702.78]  Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
[702.78 --> 706.78]  We live for you
[706.78 --> 716.78]  Holy, there is no one like you
[716.78 --> 720.78]  There is no beside you
[720.78 --> 725.78]  Open up my eyes in wonder
[725.78 --> 728.78]  And show me who you are
[728.78 --> 735.78]  And tell me with your heart and lead me
[735.78 --> 740.78]  In the blood that always loved me
[740.78 --> 750.78]  Jesus the name above every other name
[750.78 --> 757.78]  Jesus the only one who could ever sing
[757.78 --> 763.78]  Worthy of every breath you could ever breathe
[763.78 --> 766.78]  We live for you
[766.78 --> 767.78]  We live for you
[767.78 --> 768.78]  We live for you
[768.78 --> 776.78]  Holy, there is no one like you
[776.78 --> 780.78]  There is none beside you
[780.78 --> 785.78]  Open up my eyes in wonder
[785.78 --> 788.78]  And show me who you are
[788.78 --> 792.78]  And fill me with your heart
[792.78 --> 799.78]  And lead me in your love through those around me
[799.78 --> 809.78]  I will build my arms upon your love
[809.78 --> 820.78]  I will build my arms upon your love
[820.78 --> 825.78]  It is a firm foundation
[825.78 --> 830.78]  I will build my arms upon your love
[830.78 --> 831.78]  It is a firm foundation
[831.78 --> 833.78]  I will put my arms upon your love
[833.78 --> 835.78]  It is a firm foundation
[835.78 --> 837.78]  I will put my arms upon your love
[837.78 --> 839.78]  And I will not be shaken
[839.78 --> 840.78]  I will build my arms upon your love
[840.78 --> 845.78]  I will build my arms upon your love
[845.78 --> 854.78]  And I will not be shaken
[854.78 --> 864.78]  I will build my arms upon your love
[864.78 --> 868.36]  I will not be shaken.
[869.14 --> 874.06]  Holy, there is no one like you.
[874.52 --> 877.66]  There is none beside you.
[878.10 --> 882.64]  Open up my eyes in wonder.
[883.44 --> 890.42]  Show me who you are and fill me with your heart
[890.42 --> 898.92]  and lead me in your love to those around me.
[903.70 --> 910.18]  Please join me in a prayer of confession.
[911.58 --> 916.30]  Gracious God, we are all sinners and have fallen so short
[916.30 --> 919.16]  in our attempts at honouring you in everything we do.
[919.16 --> 922.48]  So often we have failed to walk in your light.
[923.14 --> 923.92]  Forgive us, Lord.
[924.84 --> 929.48]  We can be tempted to try to distance ourselves from you
[929.48 --> 931.08]  because of our guilt and shame.
[931.40 --> 934.80]  As we listen to the whispered lies of the great deceiver,
[935.74 --> 938.68]  we can fall prey to sin and fear.
[939.52 --> 942.52]  We thank you that through Jesus we have been set free
[942.52 --> 943.96]  from our sin and shame.
[944.66 --> 947.56]  May your light shine in us through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[947.56 --> 948.84]  Amen.
[949.16 --> 952.94]  We find good news and real hope in the scriptures
[952.94 --> 956.90]  where we read that Christ, in his amazing love,
[956.98 --> 959.00]  has taken on all our sins.
[959.60 --> 963.08]  He has died on the cross and borne the sins of all of us
[963.08 --> 965.14]  who repent, believe, and follow him.
[965.70 --> 968.92]  He prepares a place for us to be with him for all eternity.
[968.92 --> 973.06]  Please join us in singing of his amazing love together.
[973.06 --> 977.12]  of God.
[977.12 --> 983.32]  Unforgiven, because you were forsaken
[983.32 --> 990.88]  Unaccepted, you were condemned
[990.88 --> 997.46]  Unalive, and well your spirit is within
[997.46 --> 1003.02]  Because you died and rose again
[1007.12 --> 1013.32]  Unforgiven, because you were forsaken
[1013.32 --> 1020.12]  Unaccepted, you were condemned
[1020.12 --> 1026.62]  Unalive, and well your spirit is within
[1026.62 --> 1033.12]  Because you rose and rose again
[1033.12 --> 1042.32]  Amazing love, I'll get it here
[1042.32 --> 1048.12]  Soon my King would die for me
[1048.12 --> 1056.12]  Amazing love, I know it's true
[1056.12 --> 1061.32]  It's my joy to honor you
[1061.32 --> 1068.32]  In all I do, I honor you
[1068.32 --> 1077.32]  Unforgiven, because you were forsaken
[1077.32 --> 1081.72]  Unforgiven, because you were அத
[1081.72 --> 1082.52] van You were condemned
[1082.52 --> 1083.68]  U.S.
[1083.68 --> 1086.52]  Lord, you were condemned
[1086.52 --> 1090.42]  I'm alive and well your spirit is within
[1090.42 --> 1092.18]  within me
[1092.18 --> 1093.98]  because you
[1093.98 --> 1096.42]  died and rose again
[1097.94 --> 1102.02]  if I
[1102.02 --> 1104.60]  can
[1104.60 --> 1105.86]  be
[1105.86 --> 1108.42]  you my king
[1108.94 --> 1110.42]  would die for me
[1112.04 --> 1116.42]  if I
[1116.42 --> 1118.42]  know
[1118.42 --> 1119.54]  it's true
[1119.54 --> 1124.14]  and joy to honor
[1124.14 --> 1125.32]  you
[1125.32 --> 1128.08]  in all I
[1128.08 --> 1129.24]  do
[1129.24 --> 1132.32]  I honor you
[1132.32 --> 1135.82]  you
[1135.82 --> 1138.26]  are
[1138.26 --> 1140.32]  my king
[1140.32 --> 1142.82]  you
[1142.82 --> 1146.00]  are my
[1146.00 --> 1147.54]  king
[1147.54 --> 1149.14]  Jesus
[1149.14 --> 1150.08]  you
[1150.08 --> 1152.94]  are my
[1152.94 --> 1154.14]  king
[1154.14 --> 1156.08]  Jesus
[1156.08 --> 1157.08]  you
[1157.08 --> 1159.98]  are my
[1159.98 --> 1160.86]  king
[1160.86 --> 1165.46]  amazing
[1165.46 --> 1165.96]  amazing
[1165.96 --> 1166.46]  love
[1166.46 --> 1167.46]  amazing
[1167.46 --> 1168.46]  love
[1168.46 --> 1169.40]  can it be
[1169.40 --> 1172.46]  you my king
[1172.46 --> 1174.40]  would die for me
[1174.40 --> 1176.46]  amazing
[1176.46 --> 1178.46]  love
[1178.46 --> 1181.46]  I know
[1181.46 --> 1182.56]  it's true
[1182.56 --> 1184.68]  It's my
[1184.68 --> 1193.16]  to say
[1193.16 --> 1197.16]  the part
[1197.16 --> 1199.20]  who
[1199.20 --> 1200.26]  is
[1200.26 --> 1201.30]  my
[1201.30 --> 1202.16]  remember
[1202.16 --> 1203.64]  how
[1203.64 --> 1203.88]  he
[1203.88 --> 1203.92]  is
[1203.92 --> 1204.46]  his
[1204.46 --> 1205.12]  is
[1205.12 --> 1205.20]  his
[1205.20 --> 1207.20]  my
[1207.20 --> 1226.88]  All the depths I cry to
[1226.88 --> 1233.28]  The darkest places by the cold
[1233.28 --> 1238.56]  In God your ear to me I hear
[1238.56 --> 1243.96]  And hear my blood for mercy, Lord
[1243.96 --> 1249.28]  Will you to count my sinful ways
[1249.28 --> 1254.72]  How could I come before your throne
[1254.72 --> 1260.28]  Yet full forgiveness meets my case
[1260.28 --> 1265.48]  I stand with you by grace alone
[1265.48 --> 1271.28]  I will wait for you, I will wait for you
[1271.28 --> 1275.28]  On your word I will rely
[1275.28 --> 1281.28]  I will wait for you, shall they wait for you
[1281.28 --> 1286.48]  Till my soul is satisfied
[1286.48 --> 1299.48]  I'll put your hope in God alone
[1299.48 --> 1304.28]  Take courage in His power to say
[1304.28 --> 1309.48]  Completely and forever won
[1309.48 --> 1315.28]  By Christ emerging from the grave
[1315.28 --> 1320.48]  I will wait for you, I will wait for you
[1320.48 --> 1325.48]  I will learn the coming of God
[1325.48 --> 1330.68]  I will wait for you, shall they wait for you
[1330.68 --> 1332.48]  Till my soul is satisfied
[1332.48 --> 1337.68]  My soul is satisfied
[1337.68 --> 1339.48]  My soul is satisfied
[1339.48 --> 1341.48]  My soul is satisfied
[1341.48 --> 1345.48]  My soul is satisfied
[1345.48 --> 1349.48]  My steadfast love has made a way
[1349.48 --> 1354.48]  And God Himself has made a way
[1354.48 --> 1360.48]  That could all trust in Him today
[1360.48 --> 1364.48]  By giving in His sacrifice
[1364.48 --> 1367.48]  I will wait for you, shall they wait for you
[1367.48 --> 1369.48]  I will wait for you, I will wait for you
[1369.48 --> 1371.48]  I will wait for you, I will wait for you
[1371.48 --> 1375.48]  Through the storm and through the night
[1375.48 --> 1380.48]  I will wait for you, surely wait for you
[1380.48 --> 1385.48]  For your love is mighty light
[1385.48 --> 1390.48]  I will wait for you, I will wait for you
[1390.48 --> 1391.48]  I will wait for you, I will wait for you
[1391.48 --> 1396.48]  On your word I will rely
[1396.48 --> 1401.48]  I will wait for you, surely wait for you
[1401.48 --> 1406.48]  Till my soul is satisfied
[1406.48 --> 1408.48]  Tonight
[1408.48 --> 1413.48]  They are minuses
[1418.48 --> 1422.48]  spectators
[1422.48 --> 1424.48]  Many students
[1424.48 --> 1425.68]  Wait for you
[1426.48 --> 1427.28]  52
[1427.28 --> 1428.48]  4
[1428.48 --> 1429.48]  credit
[1429.48 --> 1430.48]  45
[1430.48 --> 1432.48]  52
[1432.48 --> 1434.48]  73
[1434.48 --> 1434.90]  75
[1434.90 --> 1435.90]  75
[1435.90 --> 1456.74]  The first collection today is for the budget, operating costs, and all our mission.
[1458.56 --> 1462.82]  And the second one is for Cascade Christian Counseling.
[1462.82 --> 1468.92]  This is a non-profit organization that has been in operation for over 35 years.
[1469.72 --> 1477.64]  They offer a caring, faith-based approach to helping clients to move forward to healing.
[1478.46 --> 1484.96]  They exist to provide Christian counseling and consulting service to the whole community,
[1484.96 --> 1495.72]  and we raise funds in order to provide lower session fees to those who can't afford to get the help they need.
[1495.72 --> 1502.72]  Thank you.
[1502.72 --> 1504.72]  Thank you.
[1504.72 --> 1506.72]  Thank you.
[1506.72 --> 1507.72]  Thank you.
[1507.72 --> 1508.72]  Thank you.
[1508.72 --> 1509.72]  Thank you.
[1509.72 --> 1511.72]  Thank you.
[1511.72 --> 1512.72]  Thank you.
[1512.72 --> 1513.72]  Thank you.
[1513.72 --> 1514.72]  Thank you.
[1514.72 --> 1537.72]  Purify my heart, be as gold,
[1537.72 --> 1547.72]  and precious silver, purify my heart.
[1547.72 --> 1554.72]  He is gold, purify my heart, be as gold.
[1554.72 --> 1566.72]  Be, Father, spy, my heart's one desire
[1566.72 --> 1579.72]  is to be only set apart for you, Lord.
[1579.72 --> 1593.72]  I choose to be only set apart for you, my Master,
[1593.72 --> 1599.72]  ready to do your way.
[1599.72 --> 1613.72]  Purify my heart, let me from within,
[1613.72 --> 1620.72]  take me wholly, purify my heart,
[1620.72 --> 1625.72]  and let me from my sin.
[1625.72 --> 1635.72]  Deep within, be fine as mine.
[1635.72 --> 1653.72]  My heart's one desire is to be only set apart for you, Lord.
[1653.72 --> 1667.72]  I choose to be only set apart for you, my Master,
[1667.72 --> 1673.72]  ready to do your way.
[1673.72 --> 1689.72]  Ready to do your way.
[1689.72 --> 1692.72]  I would love it if we could have the kids
[1692.72 --> 1695.72]  who are going to head out to children's worship time.
[1695.72 --> 1698.72]  And so we're looking at like three to five-year-olds.
[1698.72 --> 1700.72]  Are there any here this morning?
[1700.72 --> 1702.72]  Yeah, Everly, come on up.
[1702.72 --> 1710.72]  Lead the way.
[1710.72 --> 1711.72]  It's a long week.
[1711.72 --> 1714.72]  I knew it was going to be a small group this morning.
[1714.72 --> 1717.72]  All right, girls, why don't you stand up here beside me?
[1717.72 --> 1719.72]  Come on up.
[1719.72 --> 1721.72]  Come on, Ailey.
[1721.72 --> 1723.72]  Perfect.
[1723.72 --> 1726.72]  And so we're going to do the blessing,
[1726.72 --> 1728.72]  and then you guys are going to head out.
[1728.72 --> 1731.72]  So I'm going to invite all of you to stand
[1731.72 --> 1735.72]  as we bless these littlest ones among us
[1735.72 --> 1737.72]  to continue their worship and their learning.
[1737.72 --> 1739.72]  And so I want to say to them,
[1739.72 --> 1740.72]  the Lord be with you,
[1740.72 --> 1742.72]  and invite you to respond by saying,
[1742.72 --> 1743.72]  and also with you.
[1743.72 --> 1746.72]  I did also just want to say that before these ones go,
[1746.72 --> 1748.72]  if you are staying here,
[1748.72 --> 1752.72]  and this is maybe your first time staying over the course of the summer,
[1752.72 --> 1755.72]  there are clipboards at the back with coloring pages
[1755.72 --> 1760.72]  and games that are related to the theme that we will be talking about here this morning.
[1760.72 --> 1763.72]  And so if you did not grab one of those on the way in for yourselves,
[1763.72 --> 1766.72]  kids, you may grab one of those as your parents,
[1766.72 --> 1770.72]  or guardian, or whoever is with you allows you and encourages you,
[1770.72 --> 1773.72]  you may grab one of those and then bring it back into the space.
[1773.72 --> 1775.72]  Together then, we're going to say,
[1775.72 --> 1778.72]  the Lord be with you.
[1778.72 --> 1780.72]  And also with you.
[1780.72 --> 1781.72]  Amen.
[1781.72 --> 1782.72]  Go ahead, guys. Go ahead.
[1810.72 --> 1811.72]  Good morning.
[1811.72 --> 1814.72]  My name is Sam, and I'm a member here at Emmanuel,
[1814.72 --> 1819.72]  and it's my privilege to lead you in congregational prayer.
[1819.72 --> 1823.72]  Before we do that, I do have a couple of announcements.
[1823.72 --> 1828.72]  Klaus Tessemacher, Amanda Hoguewoning's father,
[1828.72 --> 1830.72]  has been in the hospital since Friday,
[1830.72 --> 1837.72]  undergoing tests to diagnose the cause of a low hemoglobin and low energy and fatigue.
[1837.72 --> 1841.72]  We are praying that the doctors can figure out what's going on.
[1841.72 --> 1845.72]  So we will pray for him as well as others this morning.
[1845.72 --> 1852.72]  We also remind you that next Sunday, Lord willing, we will celebrate the Lord's Supper.
[1852.72 --> 1855.72]  So please prepare for that.
[1855.72 --> 1858.72]  And may you think about that this upcoming week.
[1858.72 --> 1861.72]  Please pray with me.
[1861.72 --> 1866.72]  Eternal God, Creator, Redeemer of this world,
[1866.72 --> 1869.72]  we stand in awe of you today.
[1869.72 --> 1872.72]  We can see the majesty of your creation,
[1872.72 --> 1876.72]  yet sometimes we fail to acknowledge this world is in your control.
[1876.72 --> 1882.72]  We come to worship this morning knowing only you are worthy of our praise.
[1882.72 --> 1887.72]  On this Canada Day weekend, we give thanks for our country, Canada,
[1887.72 --> 1890.72]  the freedoms that we can enjoy.
[1890.72 --> 1896.72]  In spite of some of the issues we differ on, give us contentment today.
[1896.72 --> 1900.72]  We pray for the leaders of our governments, our parliament in Ottawa,
[1900.72 --> 1905.72]  our provincial legislature in Victoria, our local township council.
[1905.72 --> 1909.72]  Provide wisdom and insight to all those who give leadership,
[1909.72 --> 1915.72]  that they may serve you knowing that you are the ruler of all.
[1915.72 --> 1919.72]  You are faithful, God, as your love never changes.
[1919.72 --> 1923.72]  And you are the same today, tomorrow, and forever.
[1923.72 --> 1926.72]  And for that we praise you.
[1926.72 --> 1931.72]  We pray for our youth who are winding up their time of getting together at a camp out.
[1931.72 --> 1934.72]  We pray that they may have a wonderful weekend
[1934.72 --> 1939.72]  and that they may have a safe journey back home today.
[1939.72 --> 1944.72]  We pray for those who are traveling or planning to vacation this summer.
[1944.72 --> 1950.72]  Protect them, we pray, and give times of rest, relaxation from regular routines,
[1950.72 --> 1956.72]  and the refreshment of body and mind, being grateful for a time to rest in your love.
[1956.72 --> 1958.72]  We pray for those who grieve.
[1958.72 --> 1962.72]  Comfort them with your peace, which transcends all understanding.
[1962.72 --> 1967.72]  Be with them in times of loneliness, despair, and mourning.
[1967.72 --> 1971.72]  The powerful words of this hymn says it so well.
[1971.72 --> 1975.72]  I need you every hour, in joy or pain.
[1975.72 --> 1979.72]  Come quickly and abide, or life is in vain.
[1979.72 --> 1982.72]  I need you every hour.
[1982.72 --> 1986.72]  Teach me your will, and your rich promises in me fulfill.
[1986.72 --> 1991.72]  I need you, oh, I need you, every hour I need you.
[1991.72 --> 1994.72]  Oh, bless me now, my Savior.
[1994.72 --> 1996.72]  I come to you.
[1996.72 --> 2001.72]  Our prayers go out for Ellen White, who is now in Langley Hospital.
[2001.72 --> 2005.72]  Pray that you would give her patience and perseverance.
[2005.72 --> 2010.72]  For Elise Wagener, who needs your healing touch again today.
[2010.72 --> 2014.72]  We pray for Klaus, as he also undergoes tests.
[2014.72 --> 2021.72]  We pray, Lord, that they may diagnose what has to be done, and that you will bless the doctors who are treating him.
[2021.72 --> 2026.72]  May we walk with them as they persevere during times of uncertainty and pain.
[2026.72 --> 2032.72]  Lord, you have walked this path yourself, suffering on the cross for each one of us.
[2032.72 --> 2037.72]  Give patience and grant healing to them and all who call on your name today.
[2037.72 --> 2044.72]  We celebrate this morning with Mike and Klosterhoff and Jane Beamers, who are looking forward to their wedding day this week.
[2044.72 --> 2054.72]  Bless this time as they exchange vows and be the center of their marriage as they may look to you for guidance as they begin their life together.
[2054.72 --> 2058.72]  Pray for Pastor Chris as he leads us in the preaching of the word.
[2058.72 --> 2063.72]  Give us ears to hear, hearts to accept the truth that will be revealed to us today.
[2063.72 --> 2069.72]  We pray all of this in the wonderful name of our risen Savior, Jesus Christ.
[2069.72 --> 2070.72]  Amen.
[2074.72 --> 2103.72]  As you can see on the screen behind me, today we are beginning our summer series.
[2103.72 --> 2108.72]  We are going to be a series on faith heroes.
[2108.72 --> 2123.72]  In this series, using the list of characters from Hebrews 11, we are going to look at the stories of people from the Old Testament and stories of their life and faith,
[2123.72 --> 2132.72]  and how that can inspire us and be an example for us as well today in our life and faith in the world.
[2132.72 --> 2149.72]  Along with those Old Testament character examples, we will each week, as preachers here, include someone from our own life and our own testimony as an example who parallels the same.
[2149.72 --> 2164.72]  And so, as we begin that series today, I thought it was smart and wise to begin with the first three verses of Hebrews 11, talking about what is faith,
[2164.72 --> 2171.72]  and looking more closely at faith, and looking more closely at faith with the hope that when it comes time to share our faith or our experience of faith,
[2171.72 --> 2179.72]  we are better equipped with an understanding of what the faith is that we share.
[2179.72 --> 2185.72]  And so, to start us off, we are going to read the first three verses of Hebrews 11.
[2185.72 --> 2188.72]  I encourage you to have that in front of you.
[2188.72 --> 2190.72]  It should be on the screen behind me.
[2190.72 --> 2193.72]  Let's read together.
[2193.72 --> 2202.72]  Now, faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.
[2202.72 --> 2206.72]  This is what the ancients were commended for.
[2206.72 --> 2216.72]  By faith, we understand that the universe was formed at God's command so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible.
[2216.72 --> 2223.72]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2223.72 --> 2242.72]  Now, as we begin a discussion on faith, I just want to acknowledge with you that sometimes these questions are most pressing in our lives when our faith is at its weakest point,
[2242.72 --> 2247.72]  or when we don't know what it is that we believe.
[2247.72 --> 2254.72]  And one of the things that is not uncommon in my job as pastor,
[2254.72 --> 2259.72]  whether it's someone from our church family or someone from the community just looking for help,
[2259.72 --> 2266.72]  is to sit across from someone in my study in a counseling conversation or in a coffee shop somewhere,
[2266.72 --> 2270.72]  and for them to begin the conversation just by saying,
[2270.72 --> 2274.72]  Pastor, I'm having a crisis of faith.
[2274.72 --> 2277.72]  I don't know if I believe anymore.
[2281.72 --> 2287.72]  And so, what are we supposed to do in that moment?
[2287.72 --> 2289.72]  What do you do then, right?
[2289.72 --> 2294.72]  And what will you do then will set the tone for whatever comes next.
[2294.72 --> 2301.72]  Will you, in that moment of saying, I'm having a crisis of faith, will you press in?
[2301.72 --> 2304.72]  Or will you push away?
[2307.72 --> 2318.72]  I've stood here before and shared with you that when I was 27 years old,
[2318.72 --> 2322.72]  just finishing my last year at seminary,
[2322.72 --> 2328.72]  I went through a very significant crisis of faith.
[2328.72 --> 2332.72]  I wasn't sure if I could believe or if I would believe,
[2333.72 --> 2337.72]  or continue to believe, or if I did, what would it look like?
[2337.72 --> 2343.72]  And that was a really challenging and difficult time in my life,
[2343.72 --> 2346.72]  and in the life of the people who supported me and surrounded me,
[2346.72 --> 2349.72]  because I wasn't the most polite person.
[2350.72 --> 2354.72]  I was not very charitable in our discussions together,
[2354.72 --> 2356.72]  even as they were charitable to me.
[2356.72 --> 2365.72]  I have since learned, of course, that a crisis of faith while in seminary is not abnormal.
[2366.72 --> 2373.72]  In fact, this week I was reading an essay by a gentleman named Akshay Rajkumar,
[2373.72 --> 2378.72]  who offers advice for surviving seminary without losing your faith.
[2378.72 --> 2385.72]  Like there's a publication industry around this very struggle and reality.
[2385.72 --> 2390.72]  But for me, as I lived in this moment,
[2390.72 --> 2394.72]  what was vital was the people around me.
[2394.72 --> 2399.72]  My wife and my friends at seminary who were patient and who listened and who heard
[2399.72 --> 2406.72]  and who graciously pushed back on some of the more ridiculous things that I was saying in that moment.
[2406.72 --> 2412.72]  And so, as we are having this discussion together on faith,
[2412.72 --> 2419.72]  I just want to remind us that it's the context of a community like this one
[2419.72 --> 2425.72]  that is so important for these sorts of times and circumstances.
[2426.72 --> 2431.72]  The people that you can turn to and say, I am struggling with this.
[2431.72 --> 2438.72]  I am also aware that this is bigger than Christians.
[2438.72 --> 2439.72]  Right?
[2439.72 --> 2447.72]  The questions around what is faith or what faith or in what or in whom is my faith.
[2447.72 --> 2448.72]  Right?
[2448.72 --> 2449.72]  Do I even have faith?
[2449.72 --> 2453.72]  Those kinds of questions are all part of the broader human experience.
[2453.72 --> 2460.72]  Now, if you are not a Christian and you're with us this morning or you're watching online,
[2460.72 --> 2465.72]  it's possible that you don't use the word faith for what I'm talking about there.
[2465.72 --> 2466.72]  Right?
[2466.72 --> 2470.72]  It's possible that you would say something like, you know,
[2470.72 --> 2478.72]  I live only by what is empirically demonstrable and in a materially specific view of the world.
[2478.72 --> 2484.72]  But the truth is, in some way, right, we all live based on a set of assumptions.
[2484.72 --> 2485.72]  Right?
[2485.72 --> 2490.72]  We all live based on a set of ideas that we can't empirically verify,
[2490.72 --> 2494.72]  but they direct how we operate in the world.
[2494.72 --> 2505.72]  And so, this conversation around faith and what is faith, while particularly expressed for us as Christians,
[2505.72 --> 2509.72]  is for everyone as a human.
[2509.72 --> 2516.72]  And so, this summer, as we are looking at the people of chapter 11 in the book of Hebrews,
[2516.72 --> 2524.72]  the faith heroes who have come before us, we will be digging into these sorts of examples.
[2524.72 --> 2530.72]  And so, each week for the next 10 weeks, we'll take a person from this list and we will hear their stories.
[2530.72 --> 2535.72]  And our hope, myself and Kevin and Josh, who will all be preaching this summer,
[2535.72 --> 2545.72]  our hope is that our own faith lives will be grown as we study the faith lives and stories of these others.
[2545.72 --> 2551.72]  In a word, this series is on testimonies.
[2551.72 --> 2556.72]  If you've been around the church for a little while, or if you've been around this church in particular,
[2556.72 --> 2560.72]  as we've done professions of faith and things like that, right?
[2560.72 --> 2566.72]  A testimony is the word we use to describe sharing your story of faith.
[2566.72 --> 2571.72]  And as we listen to these testimonies of faith in the lives of people from the Bible,
[2571.72 --> 2580.72]  I want to encourage us to think about how and where you, we, can give our own testimonies of faith.
[2580.72 --> 2589.72]  And in fact, maybe one of you is even moved to practice that this summer, here in our midst.
[2589.72 --> 2590.72]  Right?
[2590.72 --> 2592.72]  And so, we want to open up this space.
[2592.72 --> 2597.72]  If you are feeling the pull of the Spirit to say, share some of your life and story,
[2597.72 --> 2602.72]  share your testimony with this community of people, talk to me.
[2602.72 --> 2605.72]  And we're going to make that happen as part of this.
[2605.72 --> 2613.72]  But these stories of faith, right, are just the stories of how we have been or become Christian.
[2613.72 --> 2616.72]  When did you start taking your faith seriously?
[2616.72 --> 2619.72]  What's your biggest struggle as a believer?
[2619.72 --> 2620.72]  Right?
[2620.72 --> 2626.72]  And sharing these stories in community, sharing life and story together,
[2626.72 --> 2635.72]  is, turns out, a powerful way to have your faith grown.
[2635.72 --> 2640.72]  And so maybe, like I said, consider these as an opportunity,
[2640.72 --> 2647.72]  and this summer as an opportunity to share how your faith is grown,
[2647.72 --> 2653.72]  to share your testimony, to share how you see God at work in you and through you.
[2653.72 --> 2663.72]  So, by looking at the life and stories of these Old Testament heroes,
[2663.72 --> 2671.72]  it is my hope that we will better learn how to tell our own stories of God's grace and glory
[2671.72 --> 2676.72]  and His gifting, His presence in our lives.
[2676.72 --> 2683.72]  And like we said, to begin, I thought it wise to look at the question of what faith is.
[2683.72 --> 2686.72]  If we want to tell our story of life and faith well,
[2686.72 --> 2692.72]  we should have this foundational, this basic understanding of faith.
[2692.72 --> 2699.72]  And so, to do that, let me set a context for that question
[2699.72 --> 2703.72]  by looking at the context of the discussion that we're entering into,
[2703.72 --> 2706.72]  the context of the book of Hebrews.
[2706.72 --> 2713.72]  And so, we're going to go through really, really quickly the first kind of ten chapters,
[2713.72 --> 2718.72]  and there will be some verses on the screen to help map that through,
[2718.72 --> 2721.72]  but bear with me as we go because it sets us up here.
[2721.72 --> 2731.72]  And so, the book of Hebrews is a masterful and, I think, beautiful exposition of the person and work of Jesus.
[2731.72 --> 2740.72]  And so, we start with this beatific picture, this beautiful picture of Jesus as greater than the angels.
[2740.72 --> 2742.72]  Chapter 1, verse 3, it says,
[2742.72 --> 2748.72]  The Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of His being,
[2748.72 --> 2753.72]  sustaining all things by His powerful word.
[2753.72 --> 2754.72]  Right?
[2754.72 --> 2759.72]  This awesome Jesus, the radiance of the glory of God,
[2759.72 --> 2764.72]  then becomes flesh and blood like you and me.
[2764.72 --> 2765.72]  Chapter 2,
[2765.72 --> 2770.72]  Since the children have flesh and blood, He, that is Jesus,
[2770.72 --> 2775.72]  He too shared in their humanity so that by His death,
[2775.72 --> 2780.72]  He might break the power of Him who holds the power of death, that is, the devil,
[2780.72 --> 2786.72]  and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death.
[2786.72 --> 2787.72]  Right?
[2787.72 --> 2792.72]  The Son, who is the radiance of God, enters the world,
[2792.72 --> 2794.72]  He makes on flesh and He makes His dwelling among us,
[2794.72 --> 2798.72]  and He lives the life we should have lived, and He dies the death that we deserve,
[2798.72 --> 2803.72]  setting us free from the power of sin and death in this life.
[2803.72 --> 2805.72]  And then the author continues.
[2805.72 --> 2814.72]  As I read it, anyway, it makes my heart sing when we hear that this Jesus is greater even than Moses.
[2814.72 --> 2827.72]  Moses, who was as faithful a servant in all God's house, but Christ is faithful as the Son over God's house.
[2827.72 --> 2834.72]  So Moses is in God's house, but Christ is over God's house.
[2834.72 --> 2843.72]  And so as we come into the presence of God made possible by Jesus, we, in chapter 4, enter into the rest of God,
[2843.72 --> 2846.72]  this eternal Sabbath that is for us.
[2846.72 --> 2851.72]  And our souls are satisfied when we are invited into the rest of Jesus, who says,
[2851.72 --> 2857.72]  Come to me, all who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
[2857.72 --> 2859.72]  And then the author keeps going.
[2859.72 --> 2866.72]  We see Jesus, the great high priest, the only true high priest, the high priest and king in the order of Melchizedek,
[2866.72 --> 2871.72]  and He offers Himself as a living sacrifice to cleanse the world of sin.
[2871.72 --> 2879.72]  In chapter 9, Jesus has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins they committed.
[2879.72 --> 2886.72]  Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of the many.
[2886.72 --> 2894.72]  And so as we come into the presence of this Christ, our minds are unburdened, our loads are lightened,
[2894.72 --> 2902.72]  our eyes are lifted, our backs unhunched under the weight because of the hope that's offered in Jesus.
[2902.72 --> 2914.72]  In chapter 9 again, verse 28, that He will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for Him.
[2914.72 --> 2923.72]  And like I said, the telling of Jesus and who Jesus is in this book of Hebrews makes my heart sore.
[2923.72 --> 2930.72]  And I encourage you, if you haven't before, or even if you have, to read chapters 1 through 10 in one setting this week.
[2930.72 --> 2932.72]  Make that part of your devotional life.
[2932.72 --> 2942.72]  And I tell you, sometimes when I do this, I end up just weeping at the glory of God that is revealed in the person of Jesus Christ.
[2942.72 --> 2950.72]  But that's exactly what God wants for us in the telling of our stories of faith.
[2950.72 --> 2955.72]  Right? To stir our hearts out of apathy into joy.
[2955.72 --> 2959.72]  To wake our souls from sleep into soaring.
[2959.72 --> 2965.72]  To illumine our minds from darkness to His most wondrous light.
[2965.72 --> 2973.72]  Maybe you've heard me say this before, but stories of transformation fuel stories of transformation.
[2973.72 --> 2985.72]  What I mean by that is, stories of God at work in your life, and seeing God doing incredible things in your life, opens my eyes to the possibility that God might do something in mine.
[2985.72 --> 2988.72]  Or that God might do something over here.
[2988.72 --> 2990.72]  Because I've seen Him at work over here.
[2990.72 --> 2996.72]  Right? Stories of God transforming one person fuel God's transformation in another person.
[2996.72 --> 3009.72]  Seeing God at work conforming me into the image of His Son is fuel for the fire of discipleship as God uses those stories to transform other people.
[3009.72 --> 3027.72]  And it's this beautiful picture of Jesus raised, victorious, and glorified, and then interceding in the lives of those who believe in Him that the writer of Hebrews now uses to sustain other Christians in the life and stories of faith.
[3027.72 --> 3032.72]  Now then, do we get to Hebrews 11?
[3032.72 --> 3033.72]  Right?
[3033.72 --> 3042.72]  Hebrews 10, after listing all of this story of Jesus and calling us to enter in, Hebrews 10 ends with a call to persevere.
[3042.72 --> 3044.72]  It says variously,
[3044.72 --> 3047.72]  Let us draw near to God because of Jesus.
[3047.72 --> 3050.72]  Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess because of Jesus.
[3050.72 --> 3056.72]  Let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds because of Jesus.
[3056.72 --> 3062.72]  Let us keep on meeting together and encouraging one another because of Jesus.
[3062.72 --> 3086.72]  And the writer goes on to say this because what's happening at the time is there are some Christians who are being imprisoned, who are being persecuted, and the others, and the Christians who are being persecuted have to make the hard decision of whether or not they will identify with those in struggling.
[3086.72 --> 3087.72]  Will they risk their property?
[3087.72 --> 3096.72]  Will they risk their lives knowing that persecution or imprisonment or something hard is likely to come?
[3096.72 --> 3097.72]  And verse 34 tells us what happened.
[3097.72 --> 3100.72]  And verse 34 tells us what happened.
[3100.72 --> 3101.72]  It says,
[3101.72 --> 3115.72]  You, that is the audience of this letter, you suffered along with those in prison and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property because you knew that you yourselves had better and lasting possessions.
[3115.72 --> 3116.72]  Right?
[3116.72 --> 3122.72]  This is the kind of life that the whole book of Hebrews is aiming to produce.
[3122.72 --> 3142.72]  A life that looks at the high price of love, whether it's the seizure of our property or imprisonment or some other kind of abuse or hardship, looks at the high price of love and then accepts that possibility joyfully and does what love demands no matter what.
[3142.72 --> 3147.72]  That's the life that Hebrews is aiming at and calling us towards.
[3147.72 --> 3158.72]  And just imagine, right, imagine what our faith lives, our churches would look like if this was more and more our story and our testimony.
[3158.72 --> 3159.72]  Right?
[3159.72 --> 3166.72]  People who willingly, joyfully risked property and life in order to bring the love of God to others.
[3166.72 --> 3179.72]  People who don't look to the comforts and the ease and security of this life as a necessary thing, but who are free from the kinds of assumptions of style or safety or wealth and leisure.
[3179.72 --> 3191.72]  People who know that there is one life to live and only what is done in the name of Jesus Christ and for the good of others will count in the end, both now and eternally.
[3191.72 --> 3192.72]  Imagine.
[3192.72 --> 3193.72]  Imagine.
[3193.72 --> 3194.72]  Imagine.
[3194.72 --> 3195.72]  Imagine.
[3195.72 --> 3211.72]  And verse 34 makes clear that this, the way of such a life comes about, the way such a life comes about is by an unshakable hope in God beyond this life.
[3211.72 --> 3212.72]  Right?
[3212.72 --> 3218.72]  You suffered along with those in prison and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property, we read,
[3218.72 --> 3223.72]  because you knew that you yourselves had better and lasting possessions.
[3223.72 --> 3228.72]  You yourselves had better and lasting possessions.
[3228.72 --> 3237.72]  And just so we are abundantly clear, right, that means that you already have better and lasting possessions.
[3237.72 --> 3243.72]  You already have that realized in eternity.
[3243.72 --> 3263.72]  And if you don't live by this great confidence, right, if you don't live by this compelling vision of the future, you are going to be continually thinking about how much you're losing out on or losing out of every time you have to sacrifice for others.
[3263.72 --> 3264.72]  Right?
[3264.72 --> 3273.72]  Every time something that comes and is a challenge in your life, right, you're going to be thinking, oh man, it could have been so much better.
[3273.72 --> 3289.72]  But if our eyes are constantly fixed on this better and lasting possession, right, this eternal joy that is available to you, then all of a sudden you are free to risk your life and to risk your property.
[3289.72 --> 3299.72]  Because in this world, right, because in this world, like Paul says in Romans 8, 18, right, our present sufferings are not worth comparing to the glory that will be revealed in us.
[3299.72 --> 3314.72]  And so the whole book of Hebrews is written to give a foundation to the hope that is this foundation of life, of radical, risk-taking, sacrificial love.
[3314.72 --> 3328.90]  And so what more can the author say than he's already said to help us live out of this hope and out of this radical love?
[3330.06 --> 3331.62]  Chapter 11 is the answer.
[3331.62 --> 3333.62]  He's laid the foundation.
[3333.62 --> 3334.62]  He's laid the foundation.
[3334.62 --> 3348.80]  And so now he gives an example of those people who have laid hold of the future reward of joy with God in such a way that it makes all the difference in their lives here and now.
[3349.88 --> 3351.36]  That's what chapter 11 is.
[3351.36 --> 3365.70]  It is meant to deepen your confidence in God's promises so that you turn from the fleeting pleasures of sin or this life to the kind of radical love that comes from having your hope in God.
[3365.70 --> 3384.98]  The power to sacrifice and love and joyfully accept trials and hardship and persecution, to joyfully accept, like these Christians did, the confiscation of their property or imprisonment, that power is called faith.
[3384.98 --> 3391.46]  Faith is the confidence in what we hope for.
[3392.10 --> 3401.00]  That is, faith is the life lived in the confidence that you yourselves had better and lasting possessions.
[3403.00 --> 3410.86]  To be sure, right, the author will not let that truth pass unnoticed or unadopted.
[3410.86 --> 3411.62]  Right?
[3411.62 --> 3418.44]  That the heart-soaring picture of Jesus Christ in these chapters is to change lives.
[3419.82 --> 3421.86]  Chapter 11 lets us see it.
[3422.56 --> 3427.76]  That faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.
[3427.76 --> 3441.26]  Now, I trust or suspect anyway that many of us have heard this and have maybe even offered it in conversations as the definition of faith.
[3442.18 --> 3443.46]  But do we know what it means?
[3444.84 --> 3451.76]  And so for just a moment, briefly, let's slow down and look closely at these words together.
[3451.76 --> 3454.40]  The words confidence and assurance.
[3454.40 --> 3454.58]  Confidence.
[3455.58 --> 3465.26]  Now, the first word, confidence, in Greek literally means a setting under or it's a foundation, the foundation of a building.
[3466.30 --> 3474.38]  And so in this context, it's used as a metaphor for the idea of substance, of firmness, of holding everything together.
[3475.42 --> 3475.84]  Right?
[3475.88 --> 3481.98]  It's used outside of the Bible, this same word, to refer to a collection of documents that establish ownership.
[3481.98 --> 3484.42]  So it sets up a proof.
[3485.82 --> 3496.10]  In fact, if you are old enough or are part of a particular generation of Christians to remember the King James Bible, right?
[3496.14 --> 3498.22]  Maybe you remember this translation that says,
[3498.22 --> 3504.06]  Now, faith is the substance of things hoped for.
[3505.06 --> 3505.62]  Right?
[3505.68 --> 3509.34]  It's the collection of proofs, the substance.
[3511.72 --> 3517.26]  Another way then to translate this verse or this word, meaning confidence,
[3517.26 --> 3524.14]  is that we could say faith is the resolute confidence of what we hope for.
[3524.88 --> 3529.38]  That is, the Christian hope is really real.
[3530.24 --> 3531.30]  It is reality.
[3531.68 --> 3532.60]  It will happen.
[3533.28 --> 3538.36]  It's not a hope that says, I hope this will happen, as if there's a possibility that it might not.
[3539.00 --> 3542.90]  Faith, rather, here is the resolute confidence that it will.
[3542.90 --> 3550.54]  Likewise, we read, right, that faith is an assurance about what we do not see.
[3551.78 --> 3560.14]  And again, that word insurance comes with a beauty as it drives us to picture, again, Christ by painting a picture of faith.
[3560.14 --> 3571.28]  There's a Bible scholar who says that assurance here is a conviction that is not a static emotion of complacency,
[3571.52 --> 3573.96]  but something lively and active.
[3574.66 --> 3584.14]  Not just a state of immovable dogmatism, but of a vital certainty which impels the believer to stretch out his hand
[3584.14 --> 3593.40]  and to lay hold of those realities on which his hope is fixed and which, though unseen, are already his in Christ.
[3595.12 --> 3596.06]  Hear that.
[3596.88 --> 3600.64]  Faith is a conviction that is lively and active.
[3602.10 --> 3602.66]  What does that mean?
[3602.78 --> 3605.00]  Faith isn't just something in your head.
[3605.00 --> 3610.52]  Faith isn't even just something in your head and in your heart.
[3611.50 --> 3615.30]  Faith is something that is in your head and in your heart and in your hands.
[3616.28 --> 3622.54]  Faith, true faith, faith heroes' kinds of faith moves you out.
[3623.64 --> 3624.72]  Out to love.
[3625.10 --> 3626.04]  Out in trial.
[3626.44 --> 3627.88]  Out in the face of persecution.
[3628.28 --> 3631.82]  Because God is good and his love endures forever.
[3632.10 --> 3633.06]  Faith works.
[3633.34 --> 3634.42]  Faith does.
[3634.42 --> 3639.70]  Faith tells the good news of God and then lives to reveal it.
[3643.14 --> 3647.30]  Now, even as we hear all that, and as we sing the beauty of it,
[3647.70 --> 3650.60]  let's recognize that that is the goal.
[3652.36 --> 3653.48]  We don't always get there.
[3654.86 --> 3658.18]  But that's where our hearts of faith point.
[3658.18 --> 3667.00]  And so, really clearly, let me say that questions and doubts don't have to be obstacles to this kind of faith.
[3667.00 --> 3668.00]  Right?
[3668.00 --> 3672.68]  Questions and doubts can spur our faith deeper and broader.
[3672.68 --> 3682.82]  And so, this summer, as you come and worship, as we tell stories of faith, as we look to these faith heroes,
[3682.82 --> 3691.90]  I hope and pray that you will be moved into and towards a kind of faith that moves you out.
[3692.60 --> 3694.48]  Moves you out of your comfort zone.
[3694.70 --> 3697.24]  Moves you into the lives of other people.
[3697.24 --> 3705.16]  And so, whether you camp or cottage, whether you visit with neighbors or friends, as you sit with kids or grandkids, right?
[3705.40 --> 3707.50]  Tell your stories of faith.
[3707.50 --> 3712.04]  It breaks my heart.
[3713.34 --> 3718.96]  Breaks my heart how many times when I'm talking with people that I hear that their families,
[3719.26 --> 3724.56]  the homes that they grew up in or the friends that they are part of, just don't talk about faith.
[3726.48 --> 3728.54]  And maybe you read the Bible together as a family.
[3728.64 --> 3729.12]  That's awesome.
[3729.26 --> 3729.66]  That's great.
[3729.88 --> 3731.30]  Maybe you pray together as a family.
[3731.38 --> 3731.92]  That's awesome.
[3732.18 --> 3732.72]  That's great.
[3733.02 --> 3736.06]  Maybe you even worship together, right, with people or you study together.
[3736.06 --> 3746.84]  But we need to start talking about how faith works in our lives, about if faith works in our lives.
[3747.90 --> 3752.64]  Tell your kids, tell your friends, tell your co-workers about your faith.
[3752.78 --> 3756.32]  Tell them your struggles, your joys, your trials, your tribulations.
[3756.54 --> 3757.36]  Tell them your successes.
[3757.70 --> 3758.48]  Tell them your failures.
[3759.02 --> 3764.30]  Tell them when you've been on the mountaintop and tell them when you've been in the dark night of the soul.
[3764.30 --> 3771.00]  Invite other people into your life and story of faith.
[3771.76 --> 3777.38]  Because stories of transformation in you fuel transformation in other people.
[3777.38 --> 3794.42]  When I was 19 years old, in many ways, my story is stereotypical for a number of people who were raised in the Christian church.
[3796.00 --> 3799.28]  In some ways, my story maybe is a little bit more extreme.
[3799.28 --> 3806.48]  When I was a teenager, I got pretty strong into recreational drug use.
[3806.68 --> 3810.02]  Got pretty strong into the sort of party scene.
[3810.74 --> 3816.64]  Drinking and doing all sorts of things with and to people that I should not.
[3816.64 --> 3829.56]  And were it not for one man, I don't know where I would be today.
[3832.24 --> 3841.32]  God used one man, Paul Vandenbrink, who was a pastor in our church, to call me back to life and faith.
[3841.32 --> 3847.20]  And he did it by sitting down across from me one day and saying,
[3847.78 --> 3852.56]  I am going to spend the next year walking through life with you.
[3853.38 --> 3854.52]  We're going to meet weekly.
[3854.96 --> 3855.98]  We're going to read the Bible.
[3856.32 --> 3858.94]  And we're just going to talk about life and faith.
[3859.64 --> 3861.42]  And he looked me square in the eyes and he said,
[3861.48 --> 3866.48]  Chris, I'm not going to accept any of that BS that you give other people.
[3867.96 --> 3868.86]  We're going to be real.
[3868.86 --> 3875.46]  And over the course of that year, Jesus became alive to me.
[3876.36 --> 3879.36]  Because Jesus was alive in Paul.
[3881.50 --> 3886.56]  And through Paul's willingness to sit down across from me and to call me to account,
[3886.70 --> 3892.10]  through Paul's willingness to hold me to a standard of faithfulness and holiness,
[3892.10 --> 3900.22]  and to challenge me on that, God turned my life completely around.
[3901.88 --> 3907.08]  To this day, I consider Paul a mentor and friend.
[3907.08 --> 3914.36]  To this day, I thank God for his use of Paul in my life,
[3914.90 --> 3918.08]  without whom I probably wouldn't be here,
[3919.08 --> 3921.00]  without whom I don't know,
[3922.00 --> 3925.02]  and I hesitate to think where I might be.
[3925.02 --> 3935.44]  These are the kinds of stories and life together that we are invited to live today.
[3935.44 --> 3942.18]  And these stories of faith, whether the Old Testament ones or the ones we live now,
[3942.28 --> 3949.60]  these stories of faith stack together with the purpose of calling and carrying you towards
[3949.60 --> 3952.18]  a better and lasting possession.
[3953.64 --> 3956.38]  Really quickly, and this is where we're going to land this morning,
[3956.38 --> 3962.06]  chapter 11 feeds directly into chapter 12.
[3962.24 --> 3965.12]  And chapter 12, the first three verses says,
[3965.62 --> 3970.12]  Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses,
[3970.56 --> 3974.74]  let us throw off everything that hinders in the sin that so easily entangles,
[3974.94 --> 3978.32]  and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us,
[3978.74 --> 3984.24]  fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of our faith.
[3984.24 --> 3989.76]  That great cloud of witnesses, right?
[3989.82 --> 3995.42]  That great cloud of witnesses that is calling you to fix your eyes on Jesus,
[3995.62 --> 3997.00]  the author and perfecter of your faith,
[3997.10 --> 4002.08]  that great cloud of witnesses is not only these people listed in chapter 11,
[4002.98 --> 4005.60]  but it is the Pauls in your life.
[4007.08 --> 4008.34]  It is the mentors.
[4008.90 --> 4011.62]  It is the people who have spoken truth to you.
[4011.62 --> 4014.54]  It is the people who have modeled transformation to you.
[4015.80 --> 4022.14]  That great cloud of witnesses is made up of the stories and lives that have shaped you,
[4022.66 --> 4025.84]  stories and lives that call you towards Jesus.
[4026.10 --> 4029.10]  And that's what your story does.
[4029.98 --> 4033.12]  That's what makes someone a faith hero,
[4034.76 --> 4040.26]  that your story is used by God to draw us closer to Jesus.
[4040.26 --> 4044.64]  So we began by talking about the crisis of faith.
[4045.92 --> 4048.60]  I want to reframe that as an opportunity.
[4049.66 --> 4054.10]  Turn your crisis of faith into a crisis of unbelief.
[4055.30 --> 4056.52]  Hear what I'm saying, right?
[4056.56 --> 4061.24]  The default position of humanity since our rebellion is the rejection of God.
[4061.50 --> 4064.96]  The default position of humanity because of sin in the world is unbelief.
[4064.96 --> 4071.32]  And so for any desire of faith, for any amount of belief,
[4071.46 --> 4077.78]  any longing for God that lives in your heart is actually a crisis of your unbelief.
[4078.66 --> 4079.26]  Right?
[4079.36 --> 4081.16]  Your stories are doing that.
[4082.64 --> 4086.92]  And so tell your stories because they challenge my unbelief.
[4086.92 --> 4093.88]  Tell your stories because they let me see God at work in the world.
[4094.10 --> 4095.92]  Share life and story together.
[4096.10 --> 4098.76]  And I promise you, on the conviction of God's Word,
[4098.84 --> 4102.44]  the truth of Hebrews 11, feeding right into Hebrews 12,
[4102.90 --> 4104.88]  that you will be transformed.
[4106.32 --> 4111.54]  Stories of God's transformation in you fuel God's transformation in others.
[4111.54 --> 4116.10]  And so don't rob another of God's transformation.
[4117.36 --> 4124.96]  Instead, be the fuel that God uses for their being and becoming more like Jesus.
[4126.10 --> 4133.10]  Be the story that calls us to fix our eyes on Him.
[4134.20 --> 4135.70]  That's where we go this summer.
[4136.34 --> 4137.30]  I hope you'll go with me.
[4137.94 --> 4138.64]  Let's pray together.
[4141.54 --> 4146.92]  Holy God, open our eyes to You.
[4147.72 --> 4152.96]  Lord Jesus, move in us that we might fix our eyes on You.
[4154.16 --> 4157.20]  And may it be today, may it be this summer,
[4157.76 --> 4163.96]  that those around us are used by You to turn our heads towards You,
[4164.02 --> 4166.84]  to turn our hearts in worship of You.
[4166.84 --> 4172.00]  May we hear and share stories of You at work in the world
[4172.00 --> 4177.88]  that we might be the kind of faith heroes that You have given us before.
[4177.88 --> 4185.46]  And so use us, we pray, even us, to reveal You,
[4186.72 --> 4189.92]  to reveal Your kingdom come and Your kingdom coming.
[4191.50 --> 4196.08]  Grant us the kind of faith that goes out
[4196.08 --> 4200.24]  and shares how You are at work.
[4200.24 --> 4203.10]  To this end, we pray.
[4204.06 --> 4206.10]  And all God's people said, Amen.
[4206.10 --> 4206.26]  Amen.
[4206.26 --> 4214.44]  plat Diaz
[4214.44 --> 4228.52]  I do see the light of all
[4228.52 --> 4234.36]  In the light of creation's grand design
[4234.36 --> 4242.36]  In the light of words within His faithfulness
[4242.36 --> 4248.36]  One by faith and not by sin
[4248.36 --> 4254.36]  The earth of the earth
[4254.36 --> 4261.36]  With the power of His promise in our own hands
[4261.36 --> 4268.36]  An only city built by God's old man
[4268.36 --> 4272.86]  Of peace in green and justice
[4272.86 --> 4280.36]  We will stand as children of the cross
[4280.36 --> 4287.36]  We will face our eyes on Him, our souls reward
[4287.36 --> 4295.36]  The race is finished and the work is done
[4295.36 --> 4301.36]  We will face our faith in our own hands
[4301.36 --> 4311.36]  By faith the prophets saw day
[4311.36 --> 4318.36]  And the long-form Messiah would be
[4318.36 --> 4324.36]  The proud to break the chains of sin and death
[4324.36 --> 4330.36]  And rise triumphant from the grave
[4330.36 --> 4336.36]  The church was hard to call
[4336.36 --> 4342.36]  The power of the Spirit to the law
[4342.36 --> 4352.36]  To deliver captives and to preach good news
[4352.36 --> 4356.36]  In every corner of the earth
[4356.36 --> 4362.36]  We will stand as children of the cross
[4362.36 --> 4368.36]  We will face our eyes on Him, our souls reward
[4368.36 --> 4376.36]  Till the race is finished and the work is done
[4376.36 --> 4378.36]  We will face our eyes on Him, our souls reward
[4378.36 --> 4382.36]  Through our faith and not by sin
[4382.36 --> 4392.36]  Through our faith the mountains shall be moved
[4392.36 --> 4398.36]  And the power of the gospel shall prevail
[4398.36 --> 4405.36]  Where we know Christ all things are possible
[4405.36 --> 4413.36]  Wherever we know in Christ all things are possible
[4413.36 --> 4415.36]  For our moment in our own hands
[4415.36 --> 4421.36]  We will find our children of Him, our souls reward
[4421.36 --> 4423.36]  eyes on him
[4425.36 --> 4433.36]  till the race is finished and the work is done
[4433.36 --> 4437.36]  by faith and not myself
[4437.36 --> 4443.36]  we will stand as children of the power
[4443.36 --> 4449.36]  we will fix our eyes on him
[4449.36 --> 4459.36]  till the race is finished and the work is done
[4459.36 --> 4465.36]  we will walk by faith and not myself
[4465.36 --> 4471.36]  we will walk by faith and not myself
[4471.36 --> 4481.36]  as you go go in
[4481.36 --> 4483.36]  faith go with
[4483.36 --> 4485.36]  God himself who goes
[4485.36 --> 4487.36]  with you before

[4489.36 --> 4491.36]  you would like prayer
[4491.36 --> 4493.36]  or to meet with someone to

[4495.36 --> 4497.36]  there will be someone here at the front with a
[4497.36 --> 4499.36]  name tag like this with a yellow box on it
[4499.36 --> 4501.36]  they would love to meet you and to
[4501.36 --> 4503.36]  air prayer with you
[4503.36 --> 4507.36]  let's receive God's blessing together
[4507.36 --> 4511.36]  God go before

[4513.36 --> 4515.36]  God go behind you
[4515.36 --> 4517.36]  to protect you

[4521.36 --> 4523.36]  to befriend you
[4523.36 --> 4525.36]  do not be afraid
[4525.36 --> 4527.36]  let the blessing of God the Father
[4527.36 --> 4529.36]  Son and Holy Spirit come upon you
[4529.36 --> 4531.36]  I want you today
[4531.36 --> 4533.36]  do not be afraid
[4533.36 --> 4535.36]  but go in peace
[4535.36 --> 4537.36]  to love and serve the Lord
[4537.36 --> 4539.36]  Amen
[4539.36 --> 4541.36]  Amen
