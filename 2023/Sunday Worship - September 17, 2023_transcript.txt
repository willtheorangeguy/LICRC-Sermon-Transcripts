[0.00 --> 7.00]  Great I am
[7.00 --> 14.00]  Great I am
[14.00 --> 20.00]  Great I am
[30.00 --> 36.00]  It was a good moderation
[36.00 --> 43.00]  Notice how the哪 borrow?
[43.00 --> 47.00]  It is a good clarity
[47.00 --> 53.00]  What time do you mean theners for coming from last day?
[53.00 --> 56.00]  I have taken care of
[56.00 --> 65.10]  The one who pledged to save me and walk with him for all eternity.
[68.90 --> 75.50]  There will be a day when all will bow before him.
[75.50 --> 82.20]  There will be a day when death will be no more.
[82.20 --> 90.20]  Standing face to face with he who died and rose again.
[90.20 --> 95.20]  Holy, holy is the Lord.
[99.20 --> 105.20]  And every prayer we prayed in desperation.
[105.20 --> 111.20]  The songs of faith we sang through doubt and fear.
[112.20 --> 118.20]  In the end, we'll see that it was worth it.
[118.20 --> 125.20]  When he returns to wipe away our tears.
[125.20 --> 135.20]  There will be a day when all will bow before him.
[135.20 --> 141.20]  There will be a day when death will be no more.
[141.20 --> 149.20]  Standing face to face with he who died and rose again.
[149.20 --> 155.20]  Holy, holy is the Lord.
[155.20 --> 165.20]  And on that day, join the resurrection.
[165.20 --> 171.20]  And stand beside the heroes of the faith.
[171.20 --> 179.20]  With one voice, a thousand generations.
[179.20 --> 185.20]  Seeing the holy is the Lamb who was slain.
[185.20 --> 191.72]  Forever ye shall reign
[191.72 --> 196.76]  So let it be today
[196.76 --> 200.02]  We shall be in the city
[200.02 --> 202.46]  With angels' kingdom
[202.46 --> 206.38]  Good morning.
[207.38 --> 209.64]  You guys are very chatty this morning.
[209.76 --> 210.86]  I love this energy.
[212.16 --> 214.14]  Welcome to worship.
[214.14 --> 218.38]  A special welcome if you are here visiting with us this morning.
[218.54 --> 220.54]  We are very excited that you are here.
[220.66 --> 223.76]  Excited to gather together to worship our God.
[223.90 --> 224.66]  My name is Chris.
[224.96 --> 226.62]  I'm one of the pastors here.
[227.08 --> 231.26]  And it's my privilege to lead in our shared worship this morning.
[231.70 --> 235.20]  You look up front and you can tell we are celebrating Lord's Supper today.
[235.34 --> 237.74]  We're excited to gather around that table.
[237.74 --> 247.08]  And we are beginning our two-part, two-Sunday kickoff to the ministry and mission year.
[247.36 --> 252.88]  And so our service today and next week will be focused on all of that stuff together.
[253.50 --> 258.22]  Before we begin our worship, we have a couple announcements that we would like to make.
[258.22 --> 267.34]  First, just a reminder, as we're getting back into the rhythms of regular meetings and connecting and life in the ministry year,
[267.34 --> 274.54]  this Thursday, the ministry and mission table has its first meeting.
[274.54 --> 279.22]  And so if you are a leader or a committee chair or a coordinator of a ministry here,
[279.70 --> 287.94]  you got an email from me last week sometime talking about this and setting it and saving the date for you.
[288.02 --> 290.28]  That's this Thursday evening.
[290.94 --> 295.48]  If you are a leader or coordinator or a chair of some committee and didn't hear from me,
[295.82 --> 299.08]  grab me after the service and I will share that information with you.
[299.08 --> 302.34]  Also on Thursday, the deacons have a meeting.
[302.88 --> 305.10]  And so if you're a deacon, be prepared for that.
[306.36 --> 312.42]  Next Sunday, after our worship, we are also going to have our ministry and mission fair.
[312.84 --> 321.30]  And so that's the time where the different ministries and places to serve or volunteer and connect will be in the back in the foyer.
[321.62 --> 325.52]  They'll have a table there set up and you can sign up or register.
[325.52 --> 330.20]  So you can sign up to volunteer or register or register your kids to participate.
[330.82 --> 336.04]  And so they're going to be on display for you to see how you might plug in to our church community.
[337.22 --> 342.06]  And then as well, next Sunday evening, we are very excited to share.
[342.64 --> 346.80]  We are hosting here what we're calling Sing a New Song.
[347.46 --> 350.88]  It's a new song worship concert.
[350.88 --> 358.84]  And so we're going to gather together Sunday evening at 6 p.m. with as many people as come and as many as you invite.
[359.00 --> 365.30]  This is an awesome opportunity for you to invite people that you have maybe been talking to about faith, church, Jesus,
[365.50 --> 368.38]  and say, come on in and see part of what we do.
[368.44 --> 376.02]  And we're going to sing or be led in singing a bunch of newer style songs and worship.
[376.02 --> 379.44]  And so some of them probably won't be familiar to many of you.
[379.78 --> 384.32]  This is a chance to, as we're commanded in the Psalms, sing a new song unto the Lord.
[384.92 --> 391.74]  And so we really want to encourage you to come out Sunday evening next week at 6 p.m. to participate in that.
[393.20 --> 397.88]  Also, moving through this list, grade eights and parents of grade eights,
[397.88 --> 402.34]  you have a meeting with Pastor Kevin after worship today in the Multipurpose Room,
[402.52 --> 407.74]  which is down the, what's that, east, west hallway, down the west hallway over there.
[408.08 --> 409.26]  And you can meet him.
[410.60 --> 415.64]  And then for the group who has been providing some care and connection for Ellen White,
[415.78 --> 420.62]  we are going to have a meeting in my study after worship this morning too.
[420.86 --> 423.32]  About 15 minutes for 15 minutes.
[423.32 --> 426.12]  15 minutes after worship for about 15 minutes.
[426.46 --> 428.08]  Just meet in my study around the corner.
[429.08 --> 433.98]  And then lastly, the GEMS girls group is looking for counselors.
[434.76 --> 439.20]  And so if you would like to serve in the girls group and be a GEMS counselor,
[439.74 --> 441.66]  you can grab Courtney after the service.
[441.76 --> 442.44]  She's in the back.
[442.78 --> 443.88]  Everyone can see Courtney.
[444.04 --> 445.00]  She's standing there waving.
[445.60 --> 449.22]  You can grab her, talk to her, and get connected in that regard.
[450.80 --> 451.88]  I think that's it.
[451.88 --> 452.92]  That was a lot of announcements.
[453.32 --> 455.96]  If you missed them, you can check the live stream after service.
[457.24 --> 461.74]  Can we stand together as we are welcomed and ushered into God's presence?
[464.42 --> 469.40]  Our God welcomes us and he greets us in worship this morning.
[469.56 --> 471.48]  Receive the greeting of our God.
[472.52 --> 476.04]  Grace, mercy, and peace to you.
[476.04 --> 477.42]  From God our Father.
[477.42 --> 480.30]  From the Lord Jesus Christ, Son and our Savior.
[480.72 --> 483.42]  Through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[483.96 --> 484.54]  Everyone said?
[485.32 --> 485.84]  Amen.
[486.44 --> 490.60]  As God has greeted you, I invite you to greet those you're worshiping around.
[490.60 --> 510.32]  Thank you.
[510.32 --> 512.76]  Our work is working.
[512.76 --> 513.90]  Take care.
[513.90 --> 523.10]  Our worship this morning is in the name of the Father,
[523.50 --> 528.52]  the one eternal God in whom we live and move and have our being,
[529.64 --> 533.64]  and of the Son, our crucified and risen Lord, Jesus Christ,
[534.36 --> 537.86]  through whom the love of God is made manifest among us,
[538.36 --> 542.70]  and of the Holy Spirit, the counselor by whom we become,
[542.70 --> 546.40]  the people of God and the Church of Jesus Christ.
[546.86 --> 548.20]  Worship with us this morning.
[572.70 --> 581.88]  Come all and tune your hearts to sing to the morning's hour of praise.
[582.22 --> 590.36]  From the shifting shadows of the earth we will lift our eyes to Him,
[590.36 --> 599.06]  where steady arms of mercy reach to gather children in.
[600.06 --> 607.36]  Rejoice! Rejoice! Let every tongue rejoice!
[608.36 --> 615.36]  One heart! One voice! O Church of Christ, rejoice!
[615.36 --> 617.36]  One voice!
[617.36 --> 619.36]  One voice!
[619.36 --> 621.36]  One voice!
[621.36 --> 631.06]  Come those whose joy is born in time, and those weeping through the night.
[631.06 --> 639.44]  Come those who tell of battle's walk, and those struggling in the fight.
[639.44 --> 647.44]  For His perfect love will never sing, and those words He never cease.
[647.44 --> 655.44]  But follow us through all our years with a certain hope of peace.
[655.44 --> 657.44]  Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice!
[657.44 --> 663.44]  Rejoice! Rejoice! Let every tongue rejoice!
[663.44 --> 672.44]  But heart! One voice! O Church of Christ, rejoice!
[672.44 --> 680.44]  Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice!
[680.44 --> 688.44]  Come young and old from every land, men and women of the arch.
[688.44 --> 696.44]  Come those with full or empty hands turn the riches of His grace.
[696.44 --> 701.02]  Over all the world, his people sing,
[701.20 --> 704.86]  Shore to shore, we hear them call.
[705.30 --> 709.50]  The truth that cries through every age,
[709.70 --> 713.30]  Our God is all in all.
[714.76 --> 721.90]  Rejoice, rejoice, let every son rejoice.
[721.90 --> 729.54]  One love, one voice, O Church of Christ, rejoice.
[731.54 --> 738.74]  Rejoice, rejoice, let every son rejoice.
[739.06 --> 746.66]  One love, one voice, O Church of Christ, rejoice.
[751.90 --> 754.90]  We stand and lift up our hands,
[754.90 --> 757.54]  For the joy of the Lord,
[757.54 --> 765.96]  We stand and lift up our hands,
[765.96 --> 784.60]  For the joy of the Lord is our strength.
[784.60 --> 790.70]  We bow down and worship him now,
[790.96 --> 794.86]  How great, how awesome is he,
[795.24 --> 797.60]  Together we sing,
[800.36 --> 803.60]  Everyone will sing.
[805.36 --> 809.72]  Holy is the Lord, God Almighty,
[809.72 --> 814.78]  The earth is filled with his glory,
[814.78 --> 819.52]  Holy is the Lord, God Almighty,
[819.52 --> 824.42]  The earth is filled with his glory,
[825.48 --> 829.36]  The earth is filled with his glory,
[829.36 --> 834.36]  We stand and lift up our hands,
[834.36 --> 840.00]  For the joy of the Lord is our strength.
[840.00 --> 840.50]  For the joy of the Lord is our strength.
[840.50 --> 845.34]  We bow down and worship him now,
[845.34 --> 849.52]  How great, how awesome is he,
[849.52 --> 852.50]  Together we sing,
[854.62 --> 857.68]  Everyone will sing.
[857.68 --> 863.92]  Holy is the Lord, God Almighty,
[863.92 --> 868.98]  The earth is filled with his glory,
[868.98 --> 873.66]  Holy is the Lord, God Almighty,
[874.82 --> 878.72]  The earth is filled with his glory,
[879.72 --> 883.66]  The earth is filled with his glory,
[883.66 --> 889.50]  It's rising up all around,
[889.62 --> 894.40]  It's the anthem of the Lord's renown,
[894.40 --> 899.20]  It's rising up all around,
[899.30 --> 905.40]  It's the anthem of the Lord's renown,
[905.40 --> 908.46]  Together we sing,
[908.46 --> 912.76]  Everyone will sing,
[912.76 --> 914.68]  Everyone will sing,
[914.68 --> 915.26]  Everyone will sing,
[915.26 --> 916.66]  Everyone will sing,
[916.66 --> 919.82]  Holy is the Lord, God Almighty,
[919.82 --> 924.60]  The earth is filled with his glory,
[924.60 --> 929.32]  Holy is the Lord, God Almighty,
[929.32 --> 934.04]  The earth is filled with his glory,
[934.04 --> 939.00]  The earth is filled with his glory,
[939.00 --> 950.32]  In Ephesians 4, Paul says,
[950.78 --> 953.66]  As a prisoner for the Lord then,
[954.32 --> 957.56]  I urge you to live a worthy,
[958.06 --> 960.24]  I urge you to live a life
[960.24 --> 963.18]  worthy of the calling you have received.
[964.04 --> 967.06]  Be completely humble and gentle,
[967.90 --> 968.78]  Be patient,
[969.50 --> 971.26]  Bearing with one another in love,
[972.14 --> 975.48]  Make every effort to keep the unity of the spirit,
[975.98 --> 977.74]  Through the bond of peace,
[978.40 --> 979.88]  There is one body,
[980.60 --> 981.58]  One spirit,
[982.44 --> 984.92]  Just as you were called to one hope,
[985.32 --> 986.12]  When you were called,
[987.00 --> 987.76]  One Lord,
[988.64 --> 989.58]  One faith,
[990.28 --> 991.14]  One baptism,
[991.94 --> 993.84]  One God and Father of all,
[994.04 --> 995.64]  Who is over all,
[995.64 --> 996.64]  And through all,
[996.64 --> 997.82]  And in all,
[997.82 --> 1001.24]  So Christ himself gave the apostles,
[1002.20 --> 1002.88]  The prophets,
[1003.70 --> 1004.78]  The evangelists,
[1005.32 --> 1006.70]  The pastors and teachers,
[1007.48 --> 1010.64]  To equip his people for works of service,
[1011.28 --> 1014.56]  So that the body of Christ may be built up
[1014.56 --> 1017.06]  Until all reach unity in faith,
[1017.48 --> 1019.68]  And in the knowledge of the Son of God,
[1019.68 --> 1022.22]  And become mature,
[1022.22 --> 1022.28]  And become mature,
[1022.28 --> 1022.68]  And become mature,
[1022.68 --> 1023.28]  And become mature,
[1023.28 --> 1024.82]  Attaining to the whole measure,
[1025.42 --> 1026.76]  Of the fullness of Christ.
[1027.84 --> 1029.76]  There will no longer be infants,
[1030.12 --> 1032.40]  Tossed back and forth by the waves,
[1032.96 --> 1034.36]  And blown here and there,
[1034.50 --> 1035.84]  By every wind of teaching,
[1036.40 --> 1038.34]  And by cunning and craftiness,
[1038.68 --> 1040.90]  Of people in their deceitful scheming.
[1040.90 --> 1042.36]  Instead,
[1043.00 --> 1045.18]  Speaking the truth in love,
[1045.70 --> 1047.18]  We will grow to become,
[1047.40 --> 1048.56]  In every respect,
[1049.24 --> 1050.76]  The mature body of him,
[1051.12 --> 1052.22]  Who is the head,
[1052.80 --> 1053.68]  That is Christ.
[1054.56 --> 1055.76]  For him,
[1056.14 --> 1057.54]  The whole body joined,
[1057.98 --> 1058.94]  And held together,
[1059.40 --> 1061.10]  By every supporting ligament,
[1061.90 --> 1064.60]  Grows and builds itself up in love,
[1065.30 --> 1067.64]  As each part does its work.
[1067.64 --> 1071.08]  Let's pray.
[1072.74 --> 1073.32]  Father,
[1073.48 --> 1075.38]  You have shown us the way to live,
[1075.54 --> 1077.28]  According to your will and calling.
[1078.02 --> 1079.30]  There is one hope,
[1079.92 --> 1080.54]  One Lord,
[1080.86 --> 1081.74]  One faith,
[1082.26 --> 1082.88]  One God.
[1083.84 --> 1085.72]  But we have gone our own way.
[1086.34 --> 1088.00]  We have put ourselves first.
[1088.90 --> 1091.72]  We have allowed ourselves to be tossed back and forth.
[1093.68 --> 1094.84]  Forgive us, Lord,
[1095.28 --> 1096.54]  And draw us to you.
[1096.54 --> 1098.38]  Draw us together,
[1098.90 --> 1102.04]  That we may build each other up in love,
[1102.50 --> 1104.50]  And work together for your glory.
[1105.26 --> 1107.06]  In Jesus' name we pray.
[1107.62 --> 1107.90]  Amen.
[1109.02 --> 1111.12]  I invite you to stand and sing with us.
[1111.12 --> 1122.80]  O Lord,
[1122.80 --> 1136.80]  O Lord,
[1136.80 --> 1137.80]  O Lord,
[1137.80 --> 1138.80]  O Lord,
[1138.80 --> 1140.76]  O Lord,
[1140.76 --> 1142.76]  O Lord,
[1142.76 --> 1144.76]  Forgive us,
[1144.76 --> 1150.28]  We have lost beyond you.
[1150.28 --> 1152.84]  Have mercy,
[1152.84 --> 1154.84]  Have mercy,
[1154.84 --> 1155.84]  Have mercy,
[1155.84 --> 1160.60]  O Lord,
[1160.60 --> 1177.88]  Lord,
[1177.88 --> 1179.24]  with thirsty
[1179.24 --> 1181.84]  O
[1181.84 --> 1183.36]  Lord
[1183.36 --> 1184.68]  restore
[1184.68 --> 1187.98]  the church
[1187.98 --> 1189.18]  that bears
[1189.18 --> 1192.02]  your name
[1192.02 --> 1193.08]  O
[1193.08 --> 1194.82]  spirit
[1194.82 --> 1197.02]  send
[1197.02 --> 1199.40]  a revival
[1199.40 --> 1201.08]  to this
[1201.08 --> 1202.82]  nation
[1202.82 --> 1204.46]  bring
[1204.46 --> 1206.50]  our hearts
[1206.50 --> 1207.86]  again
[1207.88 --> 1210.32]  breathe
[1210.32 --> 1212.32]  on us
[1212.32 --> 1213.76]  again
[1213.76 --> 1219.10]  O
[1219.10 --> 1220.32]  Lord
[1220.32 --> 1222.04]  hear
[1222.04 --> 1224.76]  O
[1224.76 --> 1226.60]  Lord
[1226.60 --> 1228.32]  forgive us
[1228.90 --> 1230.32]  we have lost
[1231.12 --> 1232.18]  the awe
[1232.18 --> 1234.26]  of you
[1234.26 --> 1236.32]  have mercy
[1236.32 --> 1238.76]  have mercy
[1238.76 --> 1239.76]  have mercy
[1239.76 --> 1240.76]  have mercy
[1240.76 --> 1241.76]  have mercy
[1241.76 --> 1242.76]  have mercy
[1242.76 --> 1243.76]  have mercy
[1243.76 --> 1244.76]  have mercy
[1244.76 --> 1245.76]  have mercy
[1245.76 --> 1246.76]  O Lord
[1246.76 --> 1247.76]  cleanse
[1247.76 --> 1248.76]  our hearts
[1248.76 --> 1249.76]  with joy
[1249.76 --> 1250.76]  divided
[1250.76 --> 1254.10]  serve the faith
[1254.10 --> 1255.14]  that we
[1255.14 --> 1255.76]  consume
[1255.76 --> 1257.76]  with mercy
[1257.76 --> 1259.20]  we're thirsty
[1259.20 --> 1261.20]  we're thirsty
[1261.20 --> 1262.20]  we're thirsty
[1262.20 --> 1264.20]  we're thirsty
[1264.20 --> 1265.20]  O
[1265.20 --> 1266.20]  Lord
[1266.20 --> 1267.20]  restore
[1267.20 --> 1270.20]  the church
[1270.20 --> 1271.20]  that bears
[1271.20 --> 1273.20]  your name
[1273.20 --> 1276.20]  O
[1276.20 --> 1290.64]  ambassadors
[1290.64 --> 1292.58]  for war
[1292.58 --> 1293.36]  let you
[1295.36 --> 1296.68]  see
[1296.68 --> 1298.64]  and
[1298.64 --> 1299.64]  what
[1299.64 --> 1301.66]  more
[1301.66 --> 1308.46]  The church that heads your name
[1308.46 --> 1313.46]  Oh, spirit, and strength
[1313.46 --> 1318.98]  The revival to this nation
[1318.98 --> 1324.14]  Breathe on us again
[1324.14 --> 1329.42]  Breathe on us again
[1331.66 --> 1361.64]  Breathe on us again
[1361.66 --> 1370.78]  Don't drop a single anchor
[1370.78 --> 1373.28]  We're almost home
[1373.28 --> 1376.04]  Through every toilet teacher
[1376.04 --> 1378.54]  We're almost home
[1378.54 --> 1381.10]  How many children sing
[1381.10 --> 1383.74]  Something for us not
[1383.74 --> 1385.52]  No stopping now
[1385.52 --> 1387.66]  We're almost home
[1387.66 --> 1394.28]  The promised land is strong
[1394.28 --> 1396.78]  We're almost home
[1396.78 --> 1399.28]  And not a tear shall fall
[1399.28 --> 1402.04]  And we're almost home
[1402.04 --> 1404.70]  We're bringing out our souls
[1404.70 --> 1406.78]  That our kingdom's grown
[1406.78 --> 1408.78]  No turning back
[1408.78 --> 1411.40]  We're almost home
[1411.40 --> 1413.40]  We're almost home
[1413.40 --> 1417.40]  We're almost home
[1417.40 --> 1420.74]  No person for the blessed show
[1420.74 --> 1422.24]  We're raising love
[1422.24 --> 1425.78]  We're almost home
[1425.78 --> 1427.40]  We're almost home
[1427.40 --> 1428.40]  We're almost home
[1428.40 --> 1429.40]  We're almost home
[1429.40 --> 1431.02]  This journey ours together
[1431.02 --> 1434.02]  We're almost home
[1434.02 --> 1436.02]  A doom and great forever
[1436.02 --> 1439.02]  We're almost home
[1439.02 --> 1441.64]  But some of you will sing
[1441.64 --> 1442.02]  But some of you will sing
[1442.02 --> 1444.72]  At the happy throne
[1444.72 --> 1446.48]  And make a part
[1446.48 --> 1448.64]  We're almost home
[1448.64 --> 1452.26]  This life is just a paper
[1452.26 --> 1454.26]  We're almost home
[1454.26 --> 1455.88]  We're almost home
[1455.88 --> 1457.88]  That sun is setting under
[1457.88 --> 1460.88]  We're almost home
[1460.88 --> 1463.38]  Take courage for this darkness
[1463.38 --> 1465.88]  She'll pray to dawn
[1465.88 --> 1467.88]  No wind your eyes
[1467.88 --> 1469.88]  We're almost home
[1469.88 --> 1471.88]  We're almost home
[1471.88 --> 1475.88]  We're almost home
[1475.88 --> 1477.88]  No price on door
[1477.88 --> 1480.88]  The message over our ways alone
[1480.88 --> 1483.88]  We're almost home
[1483.88 --> 1486.50]  We're almost home
[1486.50 --> 1490.50]  We're almost home
[1490.50 --> 1491.50]  No price on door
[1491.50 --> 1494.50]  The message over our ways alone
[1494.50 --> 1498.50]  We're almost home
[1502.50 --> 1504.50]  I invite you to be seated
[1513.88 --> 1522.24]  Good morning
[1522.24 --> 1523.00]  My name is Yap
[1523.00 --> 1524.22]  I'm a deacon here
[1524.22 --> 1526.88]  Today's special offering
[1526.88 --> 1527.64]  Will be for
[1527.64 --> 1529.84]  Resonate Global Mission
[1529.84 --> 1531.74]  Resonate Global Missions
[1531.74 --> 1532.78]  Is an organization
[1532.78 --> 1534.06]  That works alongside
[1534.06 --> 1536.32]  Christian Reformed churches
[1536.32 --> 1538.56]  As they join God's mission
[1538.56 --> 1539.64]  In their own neighborhoods
[1539.64 --> 1540.64]  And around the world
[1540.64 --> 1542.98]  In preparing missionaries
[1542.98 --> 1543.64]  And volunteers
[1543.64 --> 1545.32]  Supporting church planters
[1545.32 --> 1547.32]  And campus ministers
[1547.32 --> 1549.92]  Connecting with ministries overseas
[1549.92 --> 1551.40]  Engaging church members
[1551.40 --> 1554.34]  And younger generations
[1554.34 --> 1555.18]  In mission work
[1555.18 --> 1557.64]  And following the spirit
[1557.64 --> 1558.58]  By discerning
[1558.58 --> 1560.98]  New ways to proclaim the gospel
[1560.98 --> 1565.82]  From John 20 verse 21
[1565.82 --> 1567.74]  Again Jesus said
[1567.74 --> 1568.88]  Peace be with you
[1568.88 --> 1571.02]  As the Father sent me
[1571.02 --> 1571.98]  I am sending you
[1571.98 --> 1574.52]  Again Jesus said
[1574.52 --> 1584.22]  I am sending you
[1584.22 --> 1585.22]  Amen.
[1614.22 --> 1616.22]  Amen.
[1644.22 --> 1646.22]  Amen.
[1674.22 --> 1676.22]  Amen.
[1704.22 --> 1732.02]  Good morning.
[1732.02 --> 1736.90]  My name is Mike and I'm an elder here and I have a special announcement that involves
[1736.90 --> 1737.76]  the Lowberg family.
[1737.90 --> 1740.62]  But we're going to show a photo first, I think.
[1741.20 --> 1745.82]  I wonder if any of the kids and youth can guess who some of, well, the one guy on the
[1745.82 --> 1748.12]  right who that young dapper fellow is.
[1750.08 --> 1750.86]  Any guesses?
[1751.40 --> 1752.94]  No one knows.
[1753.94 --> 1757.04]  Aging, aging differently at different, yeah.
[1757.34 --> 1758.62]  Well, there's Pastor Kev.
[1758.62 --> 1762.10]  So there's a few other photos we can look at here.
[1762.18 --> 1767.56]  I went digging through my coffers of photos to find a few shots.
[1767.72 --> 1772.46]  Here's Kevin and Nikki at like an initial youth leaders, I think, team building event.
[1773.28 --> 1776.98]  And I think this actually, it's, yeah, it's impossible to see.
[1776.98 --> 1787.36]  But way over here in the back corner is Kev at, this was a summer youth event before you
[1787.36 --> 1793.24]  were hired where you came out and sort of, yeah, like what's the word when you trial out?
[1793.36 --> 1794.78]  You meet us, we meet you.
[1795.34 --> 1796.64]  Yeah, we judged him.
[1797.42 --> 1797.56]  Yeah.
[1797.56 --> 1799.08]  Yeah.
[1799.26 --> 1800.00]  So, yeah.
[1800.18 --> 1800.66]  So, yeah.
[1800.80 --> 1802.78]  You know, a little ringer on the rose, whatever we were doing.
[1803.10 --> 1803.88]  So, same event.
[1803.98 --> 1807.80]  And he's also hidden in the dark, I believe, on the far right.
[1809.06 --> 1809.42]  Yeah.
[1809.48 --> 1810.68]  He's a little bit closer up there.
[1811.00 --> 1821.02]  So, this was also the photo that we were introduced to when Kev initially applied and then also was
[1821.02 --> 1823.56]  sent out to the church when we announced that Kev was hired.
[1823.56 --> 1825.82]  And this is the milestone we're celebrating this week.
[1825.90 --> 1829.68]  So, last week, Kev hit 15 years at Langley-Emmanuel.
[1834.92 --> 1835.36]  Yeah.
[1835.58 --> 1841.24]  So, Kev and Nikki and the girls, if you want to come up just briefly, we won't spend all
[1841.24 --> 1842.20]  morning on this, of course.
[1842.32 --> 1844.98]  But 15 years is a fantastic milestone.
[1845.94 --> 1849.82]  That photo, Kevin and Nikki weren't even married yet at the time, I think.
[1849.88 --> 1850.96]  You were still dating.
[1851.78 --> 1851.94]  Yeah.
[1851.94 --> 1854.90]  And, like, youth and, like, kids.
[1854.98 --> 1858.02]  Like, just to put it in perspective, like, 15 years was, like, kind of a long time.
[1858.40 --> 1861.68]  So, like, 2008, right, there was no Instagram.
[1862.48 --> 1866.00]  Netflix and, like, flat screens weren't really a thing.
[1866.40 --> 1868.06]  What else did I dig out of the old?
[1869.34 --> 1872.06]  Obama was elected that year.
[1872.46 --> 1874.26]  I'm sure the kids cared about that.
[1875.68 --> 1876.08]  Yeah.
[1876.08 --> 1878.54]  And, like, the iPhone didn't even, wasn't a thing either.
[1878.54 --> 1881.38]  I got my first cell phone when I started.
[1882.74 --> 1885.14]  First cell phone was here at Langley-Emmanuel.
[1885.30 --> 1886.52]  There's a milestone, eh?
[1886.72 --> 1887.64]  So, yeah.
[1887.70 --> 1893.80]  And you guys as a family have grown and been a huge part of our family here at Langley-Emmanuel.
[1893.80 --> 1898.28]  So, we just want to take a moment to acknowledge that and thank you guys and appreciate you.
[1898.84 --> 1902.80]  And for all of us, just to think of all the amazing things you guys have been a part of.
[1903.26 --> 1907.58]  Pastor Bill, Pastor Dan, now Pastor Chris, working with those guys.
[1907.58 --> 1919.20]  And probably hundreds of youth over these 15 years that Kev has been a part of their walk with the Lord and God has worked through them.
[1919.40 --> 1924.56]  So, there's probably just way too many words we could say and way too many people we could yank up.
[1924.78 --> 1926.64]  We don't have time for an open mic.
[1927.04 --> 1930.80]  But I would like to encourage the church, if you have a word of encouragement or a word of appreciation
[1930.80 --> 1937.34]  or just a quirky story or a photo you've dug out of your own coffers that you want to share with Kev this week or the coming month,
[1937.46 --> 1938.24]  please do that.
[1938.56 --> 1940.00]  And I think that would be a great highlight.
[1940.68 --> 1943.90]  So, there was a photo I wasn't able to find, but I'd seen it somewhere.
[1943.98 --> 1947.70]  So, I dug and dug and dug, but couldn't find it, of the initial commissioning.
[1948.40 --> 1956.54]  And we had done this goofy sort of activity where I think a bunch of people came up and bestowed articles of clothing on Kev
[1956.54 --> 1960.50]  as different sort of symbols of the ways we were commissioning.
[1960.50 --> 1966.84]  We're not going to repeat that again here today, but I would like to take some time to pray for you guys.
[1967.32 --> 1970.48]  And well-acknowledged, Nikki, this isn't just a job, right?
[1970.60 --> 1974.46]  And Nikki came alongside Kev, and you've been a huge part of this church and this ministry too.
[1974.66 --> 1976.00]  So, thank you guys.
[1976.12 --> 1977.40]  Thank you so, so much.
[1977.54 --> 1981.56]  And of course, we praise God for all that he has done through you both and through your family.
[1982.70 --> 1984.22]  And we go for many more years.
[1984.22 --> 1984.80]  Yeah.
[1985.80 --> 1986.16]  Yeah.
[1986.16 --> 1986.26]  Yeah.
[1986.26 --> 1986.32]  Yeah.
[1986.32 --> 1986.76]  Yeah.
[1986.76 --> 1987.32]  Yeah.
[1990.50 --> 1992.30]  So, let me pray for you guys.
[1992.74 --> 1994.84]  And then also, we have a bit of a special gift.
[1996.66 --> 1997.02]  Yeah.
[1999.06 --> 2000.54]  We have a bit of a special gift for you guys.
[2000.60 --> 2002.12]  I'll give that to you now before I pray.
[2002.22 --> 2005.72]  It's a kind of a night out that you can, on behalf of the church and the council.
[2006.12 --> 2008.42]  And after the service, there is a cake.
[2008.96 --> 2010.92]  So, make sure you hang around for that.
[2011.22 --> 2012.24]  But let me pray for you guys.
[2012.24 --> 2019.72]  And if you wish to extend your hand or other gesture of joining in on this prayer, please do so.
[2020.68 --> 2024.74]  Heavenly Father, we come before you this morning, and we just thank you so much for Kevin, Nikki, and the girls.
[2025.14 --> 2027.86]  And for 15 years of just fantastic faithfulness.
[2028.22 --> 2036.06]  We especially thank you, God, for the way you have worked through this family and how you have been present in their lives and taken them through so much.
[2036.06 --> 2042.68]  So, Lord, we just pray again over them, and thank you for them, and just pray for that continued blessing.
[2043.80 --> 2047.88]  For the many, many ways we know you're going to use them in big and little and obvious and unobvious ways.
[2048.22 --> 2049.58]  We leave that before you this morning, Lord.
[2050.28 --> 2051.00]  In your name, amen.
[2052.00 --> 2052.48]  Amen.
[2061.18 --> 2061.90]  Me first.
[2061.90 --> 2067.78]  We're going to do the children's blessing at this time.
[2067.92 --> 2072.60]  And so, what that means is kids who are going to head out to children's worship time.
[2072.70 --> 2077.34]  And so, we're looking at like three-year-olds to kindergarten-ish kind of age.
[2077.42 --> 2078.68]  So, come on up to the front.
[2079.26 --> 2080.58]  We're going to do a blessing together.
[2080.70 --> 2081.20]  Come on up.
[2085.66 --> 2086.28]  All right.
[2086.64 --> 2087.82]  You don't even have to sit down.
[2087.82 --> 2090.40]  We're going to stand and be quick together.
[2091.90 --> 2093.16]  Why don't you face everyone?
[2093.34 --> 2095.28]  And then you guys can all stand as well.
[2096.10 --> 2098.02]  And so, we're going to hold our hands up.
[2098.34 --> 2101.44]  And the kids are going to say, the Lord be with you.
[2101.50 --> 2105.12]  And then we will respond by saying, and also with you.
[2105.24 --> 2105.44]  All right.
[2105.50 --> 2106.40]  So, loud voices ready.
[2107.06 --> 2109.26]  The Lord be with you.
[2109.72 --> 2111.34]  And also with you.
[2111.62 --> 2112.00]  Awesome.
[2112.18 --> 2112.76]  Thanks, guys.
[2112.76 --> 2114.76]  Now you can...
[2114.76 --> 2134.04]  My name is Paul, and I'm an elder here at Emmanuel Church.
[2134.04 --> 2143.08]  Normally, Eric would give the notes from the council meeting.
[2143.18 --> 2147.02]  We had our first full council meeting this week.
[2147.50 --> 2148.76]  First one for the season.
[2149.78 --> 2153.66]  Eric is away, so he asked me to convey those to you.
[2153.66 --> 2163.10]  Pastor Chris first led us in a time of strategic thinking for Emmanuel.
[2164.38 --> 2172.48]  And we spent a bit of time thinking about ways to make some ideas happen for the future of our church.
[2172.56 --> 2173.28]  A bit of visioning.
[2173.28 --> 2183.36]  As well, classes is coming up October 17 and 18 at Willoughby Church.
[2183.46 --> 2184.14]  They're hosting it.
[2184.96 --> 2187.88]  So, we talked about who was going to go there for that.
[2188.38 --> 2195.26]  If you have anything that you want to bring forward that you let either myself or Eric or Pastor Chris know that.
[2195.26 --> 2205.34]  We also passed a final addition, if you will, made a few changes have been made.
[2205.58 --> 2214.96]  But the abuse awareness and prevention and response policy was approved for its implementation and use.
[2215.96 --> 2220.56]  And we thank the committee that did a lot of work for that.
[2220.56 --> 2227.24]  Also, Kevin gave us a debrief on Reactivate last week.
[2227.58 --> 2229.76]  We heard all kinds of stories about how that went.
[2230.88 --> 2232.64]  And it was very positive.
[2233.34 --> 2239.40]  And we passed, as a council, approval to do that again here next year.
[2243.36 --> 2247.46]  Yesterday, at New Life Church in Abbotsford,
[2247.46 --> 2252.42]  most of council was there, I believe.
[2252.42 --> 2263.30]  We participated in a multi-church leadership training event that went really well.
[2265.24 --> 2275.96]  And I was struck when the Ephesians 4 was read this morning in the call in the confession and assurances in the service.
[2275.96 --> 2278.46]  And I go, that was the theme of yesterday.
[2279.52 --> 2280.58]  Funny how that works.
[2286.14 --> 2290.06]  Let us come together for our church family prayer.
[2290.06 --> 2307.86]  Lord, our Lord, through your glorious name and all your wondrous works are proclaimed.
[2309.30 --> 2314.42]  In the heavens with radiant signs evermore your glory shines.
[2315.46 --> 2318.02]  How great is your name.
[2318.02 --> 2324.20]  Lord, our Lord, in all the earth, how great your name.
[2326.00 --> 2331.00]  Yours is the name of matchless worth, excellent in all the earth.
[2331.88 --> 2334.36]  How great is your name.
[2334.36 --> 2341.24]  We gather in your name this morning to bring you our prayers and petitions.
[2342.24 --> 2346.04]  To sing your praises, to hear and study your word.
[2347.04 --> 2351.54]  As we have confessed our sin and accepted by faith your promised forgiveness.
[2351.54 --> 2354.98]  Thank you, Father, for this day.
[2356.50 --> 2361.38]  For bringing your people into a preview of the established kingdom.
[2362.52 --> 2366.94]  For giving us this foretaste of glory divine.
[2366.94 --> 2373.08]  We know we cannot truly comprehend the nature of your established kingdom.
[2374.08 --> 2381.22]  But on this day, here and now, we know that it is wonderful and glorious beyond belief.
[2381.22 --> 2388.10]  As we wait, we are mindful of our task here on earth.
[2388.10 --> 2391.80]  You did not create us to be idle.
[2391.80 --> 2396.58]  You gave us dominion and responsibility over creation.
[2396.58 --> 2403.08]  And ask that you will equip us for this task of developing and caring for this world.
[2405.08 --> 2407.52]  Work in our hearts as we do our daily work.
[2407.52 --> 2409.68]  And help us to do that work.
[2409.78 --> 2413.86]  Keeping in mind that all we do is for you, Lord.
[2415.92 --> 2420.26]  Raise up the church to do deeds of faith and generosity.
[2423.06 --> 2428.50]  We pray for our nation and its leaders that they would follow after justice and righteousness.
[2430.62 --> 2432.28]  We pray for your church.
[2433.12 --> 2436.06]  Grant your leaders your wisdom and discernment.
[2436.06 --> 2437.60]  Strength for the day.
[2437.60 --> 2439.78]  And faith in troubled times.
[2441.16 --> 2444.54]  We pray for the ongoing ministries here at Emmanuel.
[2445.24 --> 2450.78]  So that as we gather, we may continue to grow in faith and love.
[2451.76 --> 2455.84]  We pray that we would all grow into the grace and knowledge of Jesus.
[2456.74 --> 2459.44]  Doing good works to his glory.
[2461.54 --> 2464.38]  Father of mercies and God of all comfort.
[2464.38 --> 2472.92]  We humbly ask you to visit and relieve those who are sick and suffering from chronic conditions.
[2473.86 --> 2476.92]  That are recovering from surgery or are grieving.
[2476.92 --> 2482.00]  We are thankful that Ellen White is back home.
[2482.20 --> 2483.38]  And we pray for Ellen.
[2483.38 --> 2487.98]  She needs some extra support and love due to some confusion and transitions.
[2490.54 --> 2496.28]  We pray for Wendy Vachke who lost her youngest daughter, Elise Asher.
[2496.28 --> 2499.64]  Give her the comfort that she needs right now.
[2502.06 --> 2505.36]  We pray for Rose Vita who is struggling with some health concerns.
[2505.66 --> 2506.62]  We pray for peace.
[2506.98 --> 2509.06]  That she can feel God's presence.
[2509.06 --> 2514.46]  We thank you that Anne Prince is healing and getting more mobile.
[2516.58 --> 2519.14]  Father, we ask that you also be with Amy Crown.
[2519.14 --> 2523.76]  We know that with you all things are possible.
[2524.32 --> 2529.44]  We pray for healing and comfort for Amy and her family as they all go through this difficult time.
[2529.44 --> 2535.10]  And Lord, we pray for those of us that are broken and hurting.
[2535.78 --> 2537.04]  For broken relationships.
[2537.88 --> 2538.98]  Families that are struggling.
[2539.92 --> 2545.46]  We ask that you will help them to feel your presence walking alongside them through their difficulties.
[2545.46 --> 2552.90]  We ask now that you will bless the word we are about to hear.
[2553.84 --> 2559.60]  And we pray that you will pour out your spirit on Pastor Chris as he preaches that word here today.
[2561.44 --> 2565.16]  And Father, we pray that our eyes would be fixed on Jesus.
[2566.38 --> 2572.78]  We pray that by your spirit you might bring into our hearts to believe and to trust in you.
[2572.78 --> 2576.96]  For all these things we pray them not because we are worthy.
[2577.54 --> 2579.08]  But in Jesus name alone.
[2580.04 --> 2580.40]  Amen.
[2600.40 --> 2602.52]  Each year in September.
[2602.78 --> 2608.42]  We spend some time digging into who we are as a church.
[2608.90 --> 2618.82]  And we're going to do that this morning through the lens and through the calling of Philippians 1, 27 to 30.
[2618.96 --> 2622.32]  And so if you have a Bible handy, I encourage you to open that up.
[2623.10 --> 2625.14]  It will be on the screen behind me.
[2625.64 --> 2627.42]  But that will eventually disappear.
[2627.52 --> 2630.02]  If you have it in your hands, you can keep it in front of you.
[2630.02 --> 2633.14]  You can grab your device if you like as well.
[2633.22 --> 2637.52]  If that's where you read your Bible and get that and follow along.
[2638.30 --> 2643.40]  I'm going to begin by reading from Philippians 1, 27 together.
[2646.56 --> 2649.96]  Paul writes to the church in Philippians.
[2649.96 --> 2655.78]  And he writes this from a jail cell while in Rome.
[2655.78 --> 2664.30]  Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ.
[2664.30 --> 2671.64]  Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence,
[2671.90 --> 2676.14]  I will know that you stand firm in the one spirit,
[2676.76 --> 2679.78]  striving together as one for the faith of the gospel,
[2680.20 --> 2683.76]  without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you.
[2683.76 --> 2687.56]  This is a sign to them that they will be destroyed,
[2687.90 --> 2691.10]  but that you will be saved, and that by God.
[2691.82 --> 2694.66]  For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ,
[2694.74 --> 2698.70]  not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him.
[2699.24 --> 2703.04]  Since you are going through the same struggle you saw I had,
[2703.34 --> 2705.90]  and now hear that I still have.
[2706.70 --> 2707.92]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2707.92 --> 2717.92]  As Paul mentioned, this past week we had our first council meeting of the season,
[2717.92 --> 2722.24]  and we began that season reflecting together,
[2722.44 --> 2724.96]  and maybe even anticipating together,
[2724.96 --> 2730.32]  how we might see God work in our midst over the next year
[2730.32 --> 2732.98]  in our life and ministry together.
[2732.98 --> 2738.96]  We spent some time wondering what God might be calling us to do.
[2739.82 --> 2744.56]  And one thing, one theme that came up over and over and over again
[2744.56 --> 2749.40]  that is abundantly clear in my almost three years here
[2749.40 --> 2753.82]  is that this church loves community.
[2754.68 --> 2759.66]  That this church loves community and life together events.
[2759.66 --> 2762.56]  And that we want more of that.
[2763.62 --> 2766.60]  Whether it's potlucks or baseball,
[2767.14 --> 2769.84]  we love shared life together.
[2771.12 --> 2774.54]  And in fact, that's one of the things that I think is really compelling
[2774.54 --> 2777.46]  about Emmanuel and about life here.
[2778.08 --> 2783.64]  But we also are realizing that as a church grows,
[2784.72 --> 2789.22]  those intentional communities and an experience of community
[2789.22 --> 2793.90]  is one of the things that requires more and more intentionality
[2793.90 --> 2796.28]  on our part, both as leaders,
[2796.66 --> 2799.32]  but on everyone who's here.
[2802.12 --> 2804.16]  Now, every year, like we've said,
[2804.16 --> 2811.40]  we look back and we wonder forward around our mission statement.
[2811.40 --> 2817.58]  Now, there's all sorts of ways that churches have captured their purpose
[2817.58 --> 2823.54]  or summarized what they are longing to do or be in pithy little ways.
[2824.28 --> 2829.42]  Ours is gather, grow, go.
[2830.44 --> 2831.88]  You'll find that on our website.
[2832.00 --> 2832.98]  You'll find it in our branding.
[2833.24 --> 2835.92]  You'll find this around the building, in different places.
[2835.92 --> 2842.92]  And we talk here about gather, grow, go as a sort of guiding principle
[2842.92 --> 2845.60]  for the focus of our work together.
[2847.20 --> 2849.54]  Now, when we do that, this is what we mean.
[2849.64 --> 2850.90]  And I'll do this really quickly.
[2851.10 --> 2853.60]  You can find this information on our website.
[2853.60 --> 2854.80]  But just as a reminder,
[2855.36 --> 2858.98]  because not all of you live in this space the same way that I do,
[2858.98 --> 2863.72]  but we gather to worship God and glorify Him with our lives,
[2863.76 --> 2866.94]  not just on Sundays, but every day throughout the week,
[2867.02 --> 2871.90]  we want to be a community of disciples coming together in life and story.
[2872.42 --> 2876.50]  We grow in our relationship to God through Jesus and the gospel
[2876.50 --> 2879.94]  and in our relationships to each other and the community around us.
[2880.34 --> 2884.74]  And we go out on mission with God to make disciples of all nations
[2884.74 --> 2889.20]  and to reveal His kingdom to the world as we live out of God's love
[2889.20 --> 2891.02]  and service to our neighbors.
[2892.54 --> 2898.62]  For today and for next week, that's the sort of big frame in which we operate.
[2899.14 --> 2903.78]  And then, in particular, what I would like us to focus on
[2903.78 --> 2907.76]  is this idea of community, or I'm going to expand it
[2907.76 --> 2911.62]  and use the idea of shared life together.
[2911.62 --> 2915.74]  And so, the banner for today that we're going to operate under
[2915.74 --> 2918.82]  is that the shared life together is collective,
[2919.32 --> 2922.58]  it is contrastive, it is called out,
[2923.02 --> 2928.00]  and all of those things together, Lord willing, makes it compelling.
[2929.02 --> 2932.52]  Collective, contrastive, called out, and compelling.
[2933.36 --> 2938.42]  Now, we can see this in the text from Philippians, I think, pretty clearly.
[2938.42 --> 2943.48]  And so, in this first heading, under the banner of collective,
[2943.82 --> 2946.08]  our shared life is collective.
[2946.34 --> 2949.34]  Notice from our text, right?
[2949.44 --> 2952.66]  Paul writes, whatever happens, conduct yourselves.
[2953.20 --> 2955.16]  And so, even the plural pronoun used there,
[2955.20 --> 2958.58]  he's talking to a group of people together.
[2958.98 --> 2960.74]  Conduct yourselves, and then he says,
[2960.88 --> 2964.28]  in one spirit, together as one.
[2964.28 --> 2968.20]  As one for the faith of the gospel.
[2968.48 --> 2971.64]  So, he's saying, you are together as one.
[2971.76 --> 2975.46]  And then, he says, you saw that I was going through struggles,
[2975.62 --> 2977.10]  and now you're going through them.
[2977.18 --> 2980.94]  You see that we share in these struggles.
[2982.34 --> 2985.54]  The shared life of the church is collective.
[2986.72 --> 2989.38]  This is our gather.
[2989.38 --> 2994.34]  Now, to be really clear, this idea that the shared life is collective
[2994.34 --> 2996.12]  is all over the Bible.
[2996.78 --> 2998.74]  We have a slide that I'm going to throw up there
[2998.74 --> 3000.16]  that has a bunch of verses.
[3000.44 --> 3001.62]  I'm not going to read them all,
[3002.28 --> 3005.74]  but let me just say the first one there.
[3005.90 --> 3009.24]  In Christ, we, though many, form one body,
[3010.04 --> 3013.00]  and each member belongs to all the others.
[3014.24 --> 3019.00]  This theme is repeated throughout the New Testament expression of the church.
[3019.38 --> 3022.76]  All the believers were together and had everything in common.
[3022.92 --> 3027.58]  They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need.
[3028.32 --> 3030.44]  The shared life of the church is collective.
[3031.98 --> 3034.98]  And what we need to notice today,
[3036.04 --> 3040.30]  the collective aspect of our shared life together,
[3041.36 --> 3046.06]  the gathering that we do isn't just about Sundays.
[3046.06 --> 3053.80]  Now, the gathering of believers for worship is vital for who we are as Christians
[3053.80 --> 3055.80]  and vital for our lives as disciples.
[3056.34 --> 3061.22]  Here, when we gather, God is present and in power in a special way.
[3061.44 --> 3063.56]  He promises that in our worship.
[3063.56 --> 3068.08]  But our gathering, our shared life together,
[3068.54 --> 3071.88]  collectively continues six days a week.
[3071.98 --> 3073.66]  And maybe that's sharing meals together.
[3073.80 --> 3076.00]  Maybe that's doing ministry and mission together.
[3076.14 --> 3077.82]  Maybe that's being in small groups together.
[3077.96 --> 3080.84]  Maybe that's volunteering at different ministries or teaching,
[3081.18 --> 3083.66]  different classes or mentoring, right?
[3083.90 --> 3087.32]  Participating wherever you are called to plug in.
[3087.32 --> 3094.10]  The shared life together is about more than an hour and a half one day a week.
[3095.12 --> 3098.34]  It's, in fact, about all of life.
[3099.92 --> 3106.20]  And as I said, I think this is critical for the identity of the church.
[3106.20 --> 3112.00]  I've told this story before in some other contexts,
[3112.28 --> 3116.34]  but I'll repeat it again because it conveys the point well.
[3117.44 --> 3121.68]  Before my family moved out here almost three years ago,
[3122.46 --> 3126.12]  we were talking to some of our neighbors in our old community,
[3126.24 --> 3127.22]  our old neighborhood.
[3127.34 --> 3130.52]  And there's two older women who were not church members,
[3130.64 --> 3133.20]  who were not Christian, who lived across the road from us.
[3133.20 --> 3137.28]  They became sort of honorary grandmas to our kids.
[3139.06 --> 3142.14]  And they've never really been part of a church community.
[3142.60 --> 3146.24]  And as we were talking with them about moving out west,
[3146.76 --> 3148.66]  Sue looked at me and she said,
[3148.84 --> 3150.96]  I don't know how you can move across the country
[3150.96 --> 3152.56]  to a place that you've never been,
[3152.80 --> 3154.90]  to a people that you have no idea about.
[3155.02 --> 3156.12]  That's got to be terrifying.
[3157.58 --> 3159.26]  And I was able to tell her,
[3159.78 --> 3161.58]  yeah, it's a little intimidating,
[3161.58 --> 3164.94]  but it's not terrifying because we know
[3164.94 --> 3167.96]  that we have a ready-made community
[3167.96 --> 3170.12]  where we're going to land.
[3170.80 --> 3174.74]  We have a people that we're going to be immediately part of
[3174.74 --> 3178.08]  who are for us and who want to support us and uphold us.
[3178.32 --> 3180.56]  And that's part of what being the church means.
[3182.44 --> 3187.00]  And I got to tell you that over the last two and a half years,
[3187.00 --> 3190.56]  you've proven that true time and time again.
[3191.04 --> 3193.88]  You have been family to us.
[3194.34 --> 3195.68]  In fact, this past summer,
[3195.78 --> 3198.62]  I was able to go visit with Sue and Cheryl
[3198.62 --> 3201.32]  on our old street in Ontario.
[3201.64 --> 3202.66]  And she asked,
[3202.74 --> 3206.04]  and I was able to proudly and boldly boast in the Lord
[3206.04 --> 3208.84]  about your goodness to us in this regard
[3208.84 --> 3212.46]  and the strength of the church family here.
[3212.46 --> 3220.68]  And in an increasingly divided and polarized world,
[3221.08 --> 3225.40]  where communities are split across political spectrums,
[3225.44 --> 3229.40]  where families are divided across those same political perspectives,
[3229.64 --> 3233.46]  or where families are divided across different religious perspectives
[3233.46 --> 3235.12]  or ideological perspectives,
[3235.12 --> 3241.08]  the church becomes this really incredible and unique place
[3241.08 --> 3243.98]  for the unity that we have in Christ
[3243.98 --> 3247.28]  to be realized and emphasized and on display.
[3248.76 --> 3251.28]  Now, very clearly, that doesn't mean we all agree,
[3252.28 --> 3256.52]  but it does mean that we are committed to each other
[3256.52 --> 3257.70]  in face of disagreement.
[3259.10 --> 3261.82]  It doesn't even mean that we'll always like each other,
[3261.82 --> 3265.74]  but it does mean that we will always love each other,
[3266.52 --> 3270.18]  and that we will always make the decision to love one another,
[3270.26 --> 3272.78]  that we will always, as Paul says in a different letter,
[3272.90 --> 3275.66]  submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.
[3277.30 --> 3279.66]  This is our shared life together,
[3279.82 --> 3282.72]  and it is collective, and it defines who we are,
[3282.80 --> 3286.52]  but it also sustains who we are as disciples of Jesus
[3286.52 --> 3288.98]  in a world that seeks to divide.
[3288.98 --> 3301.40]  But also, this shared life isn't only about us here at Emmanuel.
[3301.88 --> 3306.00]  It isn't only about our connection to the global church,
[3306.10 --> 3309.22]  to brothers and sisters who believe in Jesus around the world,
[3309.28 --> 3311.32]  although that is another aspect of it, right?
[3311.40 --> 3314.66]  That we belong to the church Catholic
[3314.66 --> 3317.56]  that is Christians of all times and all places,
[3317.56 --> 3321.78]  and that's part of our collective identity,
[3321.78 --> 3329.96]  but your shared life is also part of your witness,
[3330.30 --> 3333.52]  part of your connecting around the world.
[3335.26 --> 3338.32]  Mark Glanville is a professor at Regent College,
[3338.32 --> 3341.76]  and I had the privilege of interviewing him yesterday
[3341.76 --> 3343.94]  at this council training event that we did.
[3343.94 --> 3347.08]  He's written a book called Improvising Church
[3347.08 --> 3348.88]  that was the focus of our second session,
[3349.20 --> 3350.94]  and one of the things he says in that book,
[3351.02 --> 3351.96]  which I just love,
[3352.12 --> 3357.12]  is that our shared life is the beginning of witness.
[3358.56 --> 3360.14]  And so not only does that mean
[3360.14 --> 3362.48]  that the life we share here is on display
[3362.48 --> 3363.84]  to the world around us,
[3364.22 --> 3366.70]  but that your shared life
[3366.70 --> 3371.76]  is part of your witnessing of Christ
[3371.76 --> 3373.64]  to the people who don't yet know him.
[3374.98 --> 3378.06]  Your life is shared with your unbelieving friends
[3378.06 --> 3379.40]  and neighbors and coworkers.
[3380.42 --> 3382.56]  Your life is shared with your soccer team,
[3382.86 --> 3384.10]  with your cornhole league.
[3384.44 --> 3387.72]  Your life is shared wherever you find yourself,
[3388.12 --> 3389.02]  wherever you are.
[3389.98 --> 3393.74]  You are invited to share life with those people
[3393.74 --> 3396.44]  as a witness to who Jesus is
[3396.44 --> 3398.20]  and what he has done in your life
[3398.20 --> 3400.00]  and what he is doing in your midst.
[3401.92 --> 3405.72]  Now, I confess that this area
[3405.72 --> 3409.20]  is a growing edge for me.
[3410.76 --> 3412.26]  I'm pretty good, I think,
[3412.34 --> 3414.86]  at sharing my life with all y'all here.
[3415.58 --> 3417.62]  I'm pretty good at sharing my life
[3417.62 --> 3418.74]  with the random people
[3418.74 --> 3420.70]  who come into my study
[3420.70 --> 3422.64]  and who want to talk to me
[3422.64 --> 3424.36]  either in a moment of crisis
[3424.36 --> 3426.54]  or looking for a dispute
[3426.54 --> 3427.90]  or a fight of some kind.
[3428.18 --> 3430.10]  I'm good at being present there,
[3431.22 --> 3433.28]  but I'm still learning
[3433.28 --> 3436.18]  how to share my life in my neighborhood.
[3437.74 --> 3439.20]  I've mentioned this neighborhood already,
[3439.32 --> 3440.26]  but in my old neighborhood,
[3440.44 --> 3441.28]  in St. Catharines,
[3441.36 --> 3444.56]  we lived like right downtown of the city.
[3444.76 --> 3447.02]  Our house was 125 years old,
[3447.32 --> 3450.20]  which means we were all front porch communities.
[3451.70 --> 3453.42]  We didn't have much of a backyard,
[3453.70 --> 3454.92]  but we all had front porches.
[3455.56 --> 3456.84]  And so I would sit on the front porch
[3456.84 --> 3458.32]  with my book or a glass of wine
[3458.32 --> 3459.50]  and then neighbors would come over
[3459.50 --> 3461.04]  and I would offer them a glass of wine
[3461.04 --> 3461.80]  and we would chat
[3461.80 --> 3463.66]  because everyone was out
[3463.66 --> 3464.68]  and in each other's space.
[3465.62 --> 3466.70]  We knew everybody
[3466.70 --> 3468.50]  and we lived life together
[3468.50 --> 3469.64]  because we were so close
[3469.64 --> 3470.54]  and on top of each other.
[3471.90 --> 3473.88]  Now, I live in Murrayville,
[3475.14 --> 3476.96]  which is, and I invented this word,
[3476.96 --> 3479.38]  the suburban-iest suburb
[3479.38 --> 3480.80]  of the neighborhood,
[3481.56 --> 3482.84]  right, of Langley.
[3483.96 --> 3485.38]  People commute to work
[3485.38 --> 3487.26]  and they commute home.
[3487.88 --> 3489.42]  They walk from their car.
[3490.30 --> 3492.30]  They nod to me as neighbor
[3492.30 --> 3494.48]  and then they walk in their door
[3494.48 --> 3496.38]  and then I don't see them
[3496.38 --> 3498.30]  until the next day at 5.15
[3498.30 --> 3500.10]  when we're both coming home from work again
[3500.10 --> 3501.46]  and we nod at each other.
[3501.46 --> 3503.94]  And maybe you'll hear people
[3503.94 --> 3505.06]  hanging out in their backyard.
[3505.96 --> 3507.00]  And in fact, sometimes we hear
[3507.00 --> 3508.46]  those teenagers who are having parties
[3508.46 --> 3509.10]  in their backyard
[3509.10 --> 3510.64]  and then we just complain.
[3513.36 --> 3513.80]  Right?
[3514.00 --> 3516.14]  That's a harder community
[3516.14 --> 3518.98]  to do shared life with.
[3519.26 --> 3520.58]  And so that's a growing edge to me.
[3520.80 --> 3522.16]  That's a place I'm called
[3522.16 --> 3523.28]  to share my life
[3523.28 --> 3524.30]  and I have to learn
[3524.30 --> 3525.60]  how to get better in that.
[3526.24 --> 3527.38]  Now, gratefully,
[3527.78 --> 3529.16]  some of you who are parents
[3529.16 --> 3529.96]  will know this
[3529.96 --> 3531.22]  and know what this is like.
[3531.22 --> 3532.22]  I have an eight-year-old son
[3532.22 --> 3533.78]  who just goes out
[3533.78 --> 3534.40]  and makes friends
[3534.40 --> 3535.52]  with whomever he meets
[3535.52 --> 3536.80]  and so slowly
[3536.80 --> 3538.46]  we're gathering together
[3538.46 --> 3539.60]  a gaggle of boys
[3539.60 --> 3540.72]  who run all over the street
[3540.72 --> 3541.22]  and we're starting
[3541.22 --> 3542.14]  to meet their parents
[3542.14 --> 3542.88]  and we're exchanging
[3542.88 --> 3543.64]  cell phone numbers
[3543.64 --> 3545.22]  so I can text Elise
[3545.22 --> 3545.76]  down the road
[3545.76 --> 3546.10]  and be like,
[3546.20 --> 3547.02]  hey, is Malachi there?
[3547.10 --> 3547.92]  Can you please send him home?
[3547.98 --> 3548.52]  It's dinner time.
[3549.32 --> 3550.70]  So maybe there's an opportunity
[3550.70 --> 3552.18]  to start growing
[3552.18 --> 3553.46]  and connecting.
[3554.70 --> 3556.66]  But in our life together
[3556.66 --> 3557.52]  as we think about
[3557.52 --> 3558.40]  what this might look like
[3558.40 --> 3559.24]  for all of us,
[3559.24 --> 3560.94]  my hope is that
[3560.94 --> 3561.68]  over the next year
[3561.68 --> 3563.42]  we can start experimenting
[3563.42 --> 3564.10]  together
[3564.10 --> 3564.66]  and running
[3564.66 --> 3565.28]  what I'm going to call
[3565.28 --> 3566.40]  micro-experiments
[3566.40 --> 3567.34]  in your neighborhoods,
[3567.64 --> 3568.26]  in your homes,
[3568.38 --> 3569.36]  in your soccer teams,
[3569.54 --> 3570.52]  in wherever
[3570.52 --> 3571.72]  so that we can learn
[3571.72 --> 3573.20]  how to do this together.
[3575.08 --> 3576.12]  The shared life
[3576.12 --> 3576.86]  is collective
[3576.86 --> 3579.54]  and as a collective
[3579.54 --> 3580.52]  shared life
[3580.52 --> 3581.96]  we are witnessing
[3581.96 --> 3583.94]  to Jesus.
[3583.94 --> 3585.28]  the shared life
[3585.28 --> 3587.18]  is also contrastive
[3587.18 --> 3588.10]  and you see this again
[3588.10 --> 3589.58]  in our text, right?
[3589.66 --> 3590.32]  Whatever happens,
[3590.46 --> 3591.24]  conduct yourselves
[3591.24 --> 3592.74]  in a manner worthy
[3592.74 --> 3594.78]  of the gospel of Christ.
[3596.94 --> 3597.38]  Right?
[3597.44 --> 3597.76]  And then,
[3598.08 --> 3600.28]  then whether I come
[3600.28 --> 3601.12]  and see you
[3601.12 --> 3602.04]  or only hear about you
[3602.04 --> 3602.62]  in my absence,
[3602.76 --> 3603.38]  I will know
[3603.38 --> 3605.14]  that you stand firm
[3605.14 --> 3606.72]  in the one spirit,
[3606.96 --> 3607.90]  striving together
[3607.90 --> 3608.52]  as one
[3608.52 --> 3609.10]  for the faith
[3609.10 --> 3609.62]  of the gospel
[3609.62 --> 3610.78]  without being frightened
[3610.78 --> 3611.76]  in any way
[3611.76 --> 3612.32]  by those
[3612.32 --> 3613.54]  who oppose you.
[3614.42 --> 3615.00]  And he goes on to say,
[3615.12 --> 3615.96]  this is a sign
[3615.96 --> 3616.50]  to them
[3616.50 --> 3617.74]  that they will be destroyed
[3617.74 --> 3618.32]  but that you
[3618.32 --> 3619.06]  will be saved
[3619.06 --> 3620.90]  and that by God.
[3622.70 --> 3623.50]  In the gather,
[3623.66 --> 3623.82]  grow,
[3623.96 --> 3624.44]  go model,
[3624.52 --> 3625.24]  this is our grow.
[3626.52 --> 3627.40]  This is our grow.
[3627.50 --> 3627.80]  And again,
[3627.94 --> 3628.78]  this idea
[3628.78 --> 3629.98]  of the shared life
[3629.98 --> 3631.16]  being contrastive
[3631.16 --> 3632.20]  is all over the Bible.
[3632.60 --> 3633.26]  We have a slide,
[3633.34 --> 3633.98]  we'll throw that up.
[3634.06 --> 3634.22]  Again,
[3634.38 --> 3635.22]  there's lots of texts,
[3635.30 --> 3636.22]  I'm not going to read them all
[3636.22 --> 3637.50]  but let me just read
[3637.50 --> 3638.24]  the first one there.
[3639.02 --> 3639.70]  Dear friends,
[3639.92 --> 3640.64]  I urge you
[3640.64 --> 3641.32]  as foreigners
[3641.32 --> 3642.16]  and exiles
[3642.16 --> 3642.92]  to abstain
[3642.92 --> 3644.06]  from sinful desires
[3644.06 --> 3645.62]  which wage war
[3645.62 --> 3646.58]  against your souls.
[3647.06 --> 3648.52]  Live such good lives
[3648.52 --> 3649.58]  among the pagans
[3649.58 --> 3650.96]  and here's the contrastive part
[3650.96 --> 3652.42]  that though they accuse you
[3652.42 --> 3653.22]  of doing wrong,
[3653.82 --> 3655.44]  they may see your good deeds
[3655.44 --> 3656.70]  and glorify God
[3656.70 --> 3658.50]  on the day he visits.
[3660.54 --> 3662.02]  The shared life
[3662.02 --> 3663.86]  of the church together
[3663.86 --> 3665.70]  is contrastive
[3665.70 --> 3667.76]  and part of what makes Christians
[3667.76 --> 3670.00]  stand out in the world today
[3670.00 --> 3672.46]  is our peculiar lives.
[3673.76 --> 3674.44]  Now I know
[3674.44 --> 3675.50]  that that terrifies
[3675.50 --> 3676.38]  some of us.
[3677.48 --> 3677.90]  This idea
[3677.90 --> 3679.00]  of being strange
[3679.00 --> 3680.08]  or peculiar
[3680.08 --> 3681.66]  of being called out
[3681.66 --> 3682.52]  as weird
[3682.52 --> 3683.88]  or different.
[3685.54 --> 3687.84]  But can I just say plainly
[3687.84 --> 3688.60]  that it ought
[3688.60 --> 3689.72]  to be the case
[3689.72 --> 3691.16]  that people
[3691.16 --> 3693.26]  who don't yet know Jesus,
[3693.48 --> 3694.02]  who don't have
[3694.02 --> 3694.72]  the Holy Spirit
[3694.72 --> 3695.56]  in their lives,
[3695.74 --> 3696.68]  look at us
[3696.68 --> 3697.66]  who do know Jesus,
[3697.80 --> 3698.50]  who are empowered
[3698.50 --> 3699.24]  by the Holy Spirit,
[3699.46 --> 3699.92]  and go,
[3700.46 --> 3700.96]  there's something
[3700.96 --> 3701.90]  different about them.
[3702.52 --> 3702.82]  And yes,
[3702.90 --> 3703.62]  sometimes that means
[3703.62 --> 3704.04]  they're weird,
[3705.08 --> 3705.90]  but sometimes
[3705.90 --> 3706.80]  it also means
[3706.80 --> 3709.38]  something compelling.
[3709.58 --> 3710.16]  Sometimes it's going
[3710.16 --> 3710.64]  to be negative,
[3710.78 --> 3711.26]  sometimes it's going
[3711.26 --> 3711.92]  to be insulting,
[3712.30 --> 3712.88]  but sometimes
[3712.88 --> 3714.50]  it should be inspirational.
[3716.44 --> 3717.14]  And this truth,
[3717.24 --> 3717.60]  actually,
[3717.74 --> 3719.64]  it's always been this way.
[3721.10 --> 3721.58]  Again,
[3721.66 --> 3722.60]  this is a quote
[3722.60 --> 3723.66]  that came up yesterday.
[3725.14 --> 3727.60]  In the second century AD,
[3727.60 --> 3729.14]  there's a letter
[3729.14 --> 3731.08]  written to someone
[3731.08 --> 3732.38]  named Diognetus
[3732.38 --> 3733.80]  where he's discussing
[3733.80 --> 3735.86]  Christians in the church,
[3736.06 --> 3736.88]  and he highlights
[3736.88 --> 3739.04]  this contrastive life.
[3739.38 --> 3739.60]  He says,
[3740.06 --> 3740.78]  they, Christians,
[3741.06 --> 3742.06]  love all men
[3742.06 --> 3743.74]  and are persecuted
[3743.74 --> 3744.56]  by all.
[3745.28 --> 3746.08]  They are poor,
[3746.26 --> 3747.92]  yet they make many rich.
[3748.22 --> 3750.06]  They lack in all things,
[3750.20 --> 3751.26]  and yet they abound
[3751.26 --> 3752.16]  in all.
[3753.12 --> 3754.12]  There's a contrast
[3754.12 --> 3755.84]  to our life,
[3755.90 --> 3758.16]  not only in the world,
[3758.26 --> 3760.02]  but also in how we be
[3760.02 --> 3761.52]  and portray.
[3762.90 --> 3763.18]  And so,
[3763.38 --> 3764.00]  for instance,
[3764.60 --> 3765.52]  in a world
[3765.52 --> 3766.90]  that is saturated
[3766.90 --> 3768.24]  with sex
[3768.24 --> 3769.36]  and sexuality
[3769.36 --> 3770.58]  or promiscuity,
[3771.12 --> 3772.30]  Christians waiting
[3772.30 --> 3774.22]  to give their sexual experience
[3774.22 --> 3775.40]  to their spouse
[3775.40 --> 3777.52]  is contrastive.
[3778.16 --> 3779.88]  It doesn't make sense,
[3780.26 --> 3780.88]  and yet,
[3781.20 --> 3782.36]  there's something compelling
[3782.36 --> 3783.46]  about that.
[3783.52 --> 3783.94]  And in fact,
[3784.84 --> 3785.90]  when I was younger,
[3786.32 --> 3787.00]  hookup culture
[3787.00 --> 3788.38]  was more profound
[3788.38 --> 3789.56]  than it is now.
[3789.66 --> 3790.52]  The younger generation
[3790.52 --> 3791.50]  is starting to realize
[3791.50 --> 3793.02]  that there's something here.
[3793.88 --> 3794.90]  There's something compelling
[3794.90 --> 3797.48]  about being more intentional
[3797.48 --> 3799.82]  with our sexual experiences.
[3800.06 --> 3800.54]  Christians
[3800.54 --> 3802.28]  have always said this
[3802.28 --> 3803.02]  from the beginning.
[3803.58 --> 3804.10]  Or,
[3804.22 --> 3804.74]  in a world
[3804.74 --> 3805.54]  that's driven
[3805.54 --> 3806.62]  by consumerism
[3806.62 --> 3807.80]  and by the accumulation
[3807.80 --> 3808.96]  of more and more
[3808.96 --> 3809.86]  and more stuff,
[3809.86 --> 3811.40]  being generous,
[3811.90 --> 3812.32]  right,
[3812.38 --> 3812.94]  with our money
[3812.94 --> 3813.98]  or with our time
[3813.98 --> 3815.78]  is a contrastive
[3815.78 --> 3816.60]  way of being
[3816.60 --> 3817.30]  in the world.
[3818.82 --> 3819.66]  And so,
[3819.78 --> 3820.88]  when your colleagues
[3820.88 --> 3821.90]  are celebrating
[3821.90 --> 3823.94]  their $12,000 vacation
[3823.94 --> 3825.20]  to Hawaii,
[3826.34 --> 3828.76]  you can celebrate
[3828.76 --> 3829.68]  with church
[3829.68 --> 3831.92]  your $12,000 gift
[3831.92 --> 3833.20]  to our next
[3833.20 --> 3834.48]  growth project.
[3834.48 --> 3840.82]  That is contrastive.
[3841.62 --> 3842.40]  In a world,
[3842.56 --> 3843.06]  for instance,
[3843.18 --> 3844.40]  that defaults
[3844.40 --> 3845.08]  to the homogeneous
[3845.08 --> 3846.18]  unit principle,
[3846.38 --> 3846.56]  right,
[3846.62 --> 3847.40]  where like gathers
[3847.40 --> 3848.00]  onto like,
[3848.10 --> 3848.80]  where we surround
[3848.80 --> 3850.38]  ourselves with echo chambers,
[3851.60 --> 3852.56]  Christians living
[3852.56 --> 3854.18]  in intentional diversity
[3854.18 --> 3856.24]  and multicultural realities,
[3856.46 --> 3857.52]  prioritizing
[3857.52 --> 3859.54]  the lifting up
[3859.54 --> 3860.22]  and celebrating
[3860.22 --> 3861.02]  of every tribe,
[3861.16 --> 3861.42]  tongue,
[3861.52 --> 3862.20]  and nation
[3862.20 --> 3864.18]  is contrastive.
[3864.48 --> 3866.44]  In a culture
[3866.44 --> 3868.22]  that celebrates
[3868.22 --> 3869.10]  busyness,
[3869.28 --> 3870.62]  idolizes busyness,
[3870.80 --> 3872.08]  practicing Sabbath
[3872.08 --> 3874.26]  is contrastive.
[3875.60 --> 3876.74]  In a world
[3876.74 --> 3877.56]  where the loudest
[3877.56 --> 3879.46]  voice gets attention,
[3880.02 --> 3880.50]  and this is
[3880.50 --> 3881.28]  my growing edge,
[3881.46 --> 3881.70]  again,
[3881.82 --> 3882.44]  I have one in here
[3882.44 --> 3883.60]  for each section,
[3884.36 --> 3885.38]  choosing to be
[3885.38 --> 3886.24]  quick to listen
[3886.24 --> 3888.10]  and slow to speak
[3888.10 --> 3889.82]  is contrastive.
[3889.82 --> 3889.88]  contrastive.
[3892.82 --> 3893.82]  But also,
[3894.86 --> 3895.92]  contrastive
[3895.92 --> 3898.12]  is convicting.
[3899.34 --> 3899.98]  Paul writes
[3899.98 --> 3900.46]  that this
[3900.46 --> 3901.28]  is a sign
[3901.28 --> 3901.78]  to them
[3901.78 --> 3902.20]  that they
[3902.20 --> 3903.02]  will be destroyed
[3903.02 --> 3904.00]  and that you
[3904.00 --> 3904.86]  will be saved,
[3904.98 --> 3906.46]  and that by God.
[3907.56 --> 3908.52]  As we live
[3908.52 --> 3909.18]  these kinds
[3909.18 --> 3910.08]  of lives,
[3911.08 --> 3912.08]  it says
[3912.08 --> 3912.88]  in Proverbs,
[3913.34 --> 3915.14]  to heap
[3915.14 --> 3915.98]  burning coals
[3915.98 --> 3916.60]  on someone,
[3916.74 --> 3917.58]  you do good
[3917.58 --> 3918.20]  to them.
[3919.54 --> 3919.98]  Right?
[3920.04 --> 3921.10]  To reveal
[3921.10 --> 3922.26]  God's design
[3922.26 --> 3922.76]  and plan
[3922.76 --> 3923.12]  and will
[3923.12 --> 3923.78]  for our lives
[3923.78 --> 3924.48]  and the reality
[3924.48 --> 3925.10]  of what happens
[3925.10 --> 3926.76]  when we choose
[3926.76 --> 3928.02]  other than Him.
[3929.54 --> 3931.10]  Our contrastive
[3931.10 --> 3932.04]  lives
[3932.04 --> 3933.28]  are also
[3933.28 --> 3934.42]  meant to be
[3934.42 --> 3935.26]  convicting.
[3935.26 --> 3936.38]  even as people
[3936.38 --> 3937.06]  look at that
[3937.06 --> 3937.44]  and go,
[3937.58 --> 3937.74]  oh,
[3937.78 --> 3938.64]  I want that,
[3938.82 --> 3939.48]  they also
[3939.48 --> 3940.42]  need to
[3940.42 --> 3941.06]  one day
[3941.06 --> 3941.84]  look at that
[3941.84 --> 3942.14]  and go,
[3942.24 --> 3942.44]  oh,
[3942.54 --> 3943.44]  I missed
[3943.44 --> 3944.56]  that.
[3946.70 --> 3947.34]  And so,
[3947.48 --> 3947.90]  my hope
[3947.90 --> 3948.46]  for the next
[3948.46 --> 3948.88]  year
[3948.88 --> 3949.42]  is that we'll
[3949.42 --> 3950.20]  run experiments
[3950.20 --> 3950.86]  and we'll run
[3950.86 --> 3951.80]  micro experiments,
[3952.22 --> 3952.54]  you're going to
[3952.54 --> 3953.08]  notice a theme
[3953.08 --> 3953.32]  here,
[3953.44 --> 3954.00]  where we can
[3954.00 --> 3954.72]  practice those
[3954.72 --> 3955.46]  things and learn
[3955.46 --> 3956.32]  how to do that
[3956.32 --> 3957.56]  and lean into
[3957.56 --> 3958.30]  equipping each
[3958.30 --> 3958.64]  other
[3958.64 --> 3960.06]  for how to
[3960.06 --> 3960.70]  live these
[3960.70 --> 3961.78]  contrastive,
[3961.94 --> 3962.40]  collective,
[3963.12 --> 3963.80]  shared life
[3963.80 --> 3964.66]  together.
[3966.24 --> 3966.62]  Then,
[3966.82 --> 3967.24]  the shared
[3967.24 --> 3967.98]  life together
[3967.98 --> 3968.74]  is also
[3968.74 --> 3969.72]  called out.
[3970.44 --> 3970.72]  And again,
[3970.80 --> 3971.32]  we see that
[3971.32 --> 3972.16]  in our text,
[3972.28 --> 3972.42]  right?
[3973.18 --> 3974.14]  Conduct yourselves
[3974.14 --> 3974.60]  in a manner
[3974.60 --> 3975.84]  worthy of
[3975.84 --> 3976.40]  the gospel
[3976.40 --> 3977.04]  of Christ,
[3977.68 --> 3977.92]  right?
[3978.16 --> 3979.00]  Conduct yourselves
[3979.00 --> 3979.42]  in a manner
[3979.42 --> 3980.72]  worthy of
[3980.72 --> 3981.22]  the gospel
[3981.22 --> 3981.72]  of Christ
[3981.72 --> 3982.26]  to stand
[3982.26 --> 3982.88]  firm
[3982.88 --> 3983.72]  in one's
[3983.72 --> 3983.98]  spirit,
[3984.16 --> 3985.34]  striving together
[3985.34 --> 3985.98]  as one
[3985.98 --> 3986.60]  for the faith.
[3986.68 --> 3987.28]  These are words
[3987.28 --> 3988.00]  of being called
[3988.00 --> 3988.98]  out so that
[3988.98 --> 3989.78]  you will be
[3989.78 --> 3990.94]  saved and
[3990.94 --> 3991.88]  that by God,
[3992.10 --> 3992.58]  Paul writes.
[3993.48 --> 3993.94]  For it has been
[3993.94 --> 3994.72]  granted to you
[3994.72 --> 3995.14]  on behalf
[3995.14 --> 3995.52]  of Christ,
[3995.58 --> 3996.12]  not only to
[3996.12 --> 3997.38]  believe in
[3997.38 --> 3997.72]  him,
[3997.78 --> 3998.82]  but also to
[3998.82 --> 4000.20]  suffer for
[4000.20 --> 4000.46]  him.
[4001.34 --> 4002.26]  We are called
[4002.26 --> 4002.92]  out,
[4002.92 --> 4003.94]  right,
[4004.02 --> 4004.82]  of our comfort
[4004.82 --> 4005.34]  zones.
[4005.46 --> 4006.06]  We are called
[4006.06 --> 4008.12]  out as a sent
[4008.12 --> 4008.64]  people,
[4008.88 --> 4010.14]  and this is
[4010.14 --> 4011.06]  our go.
[4012.44 --> 4012.98]  And again,
[4013.18 --> 4014.08]  it's all over the
[4014.08 --> 4014.32]  Bible.
[4014.42 --> 4014.84]  We have another
[4014.84 --> 4015.20]  slide.
[4015.26 --> 4015.78]  You can see it.
[4015.80 --> 4016.20]  I'm not going to
[4016.20 --> 4016.70]  read them all.
[4017.52 --> 4018.06]  And in fact,
[4018.10 --> 4018.72]  we've already heard
[4018.72 --> 4019.20]  the first,
[4019.34 --> 4019.46]  right?
[4019.54 --> 4020.28]  As the Father
[4020.28 --> 4021.26]  has sent me,
[4021.26 --> 4022.74]  I am sending
[4022.74 --> 4023.50]  you.
[4025.18 --> 4026.28]  This is the
[4026.28 --> 4027.20]  very identity
[4027.20 --> 4028.74]  of the church.
[4029.08 --> 4029.56]  The word
[4029.56 --> 4030.08]  church,
[4030.20 --> 4031.10]  that comes to
[4031.10 --> 4031.88]  us from the
[4031.88 --> 4032.16]  Greek.
[4033.04 --> 4033.46]  It's
[4033.46 --> 4034.98]  ekklesia in the
[4034.98 --> 4035.18]  Greek.
[4035.32 --> 4036.12]  It's a compound
[4036.12 --> 4036.86]  word from
[4036.86 --> 4037.84]  ek and
[4037.84 --> 4038.32]  kalo,
[4038.88 --> 4039.48]  which means
[4039.48 --> 4040.18]  out of
[4040.18 --> 4040.74]  and to
[4040.74 --> 4041.20]  call.
[4041.20 --> 4042.12]  So the word
[4042.12 --> 4043.02]  means called
[4043.02 --> 4043.46]  out,
[4044.18 --> 4044.48]  summoned.
[4044.98 --> 4045.44]  It means
[4045.44 --> 4046.04]  sent,
[4046.60 --> 4046.74]  right?
[4046.74 --> 4047.54]  Being called
[4047.54 --> 4048.10]  out or
[4048.10 --> 4049.20]  summoned is
[4049.20 --> 4050.04]  our very
[4050.04 --> 4050.78]  identity.
[4051.26 --> 4051.74]  That's what
[4051.74 --> 4052.86]  church means.
[4053.90 --> 4054.28]  And so when
[4054.28 --> 4054.62]  you say,
[4054.74 --> 4055.12]  I'm going to
[4055.12 --> 4055.56]  church on
[4055.56 --> 4055.90]  Sunday,
[4056.06 --> 4056.48]  what you're
[4056.48 --> 4056.96]  saying is,
[4057.10 --> 4057.76]  I'm going to
[4057.76 --> 4058.14]  the called
[4058.14 --> 4058.44]  out,
[4059.76 --> 4060.04]  or I'm
[4060.04 --> 4060.42]  going to
[4060.42 --> 4061.18]  be called
[4061.18 --> 4061.62]  out.
[4062.44 --> 4062.84]  I'm going
[4062.84 --> 4063.42]  to be
[4063.42 --> 4064.00]  summoned
[4064.00 --> 4065.28]  in witness
[4065.28 --> 4066.04]  to who
[4066.04 --> 4066.56]  God is
[4066.56 --> 4066.84]  and what
[4066.84 --> 4067.10]  Jesus
[4067.10 --> 4067.94]  has done.
[4068.16 --> 4068.58]  Everything
[4068.58 --> 4069.56]  we do
[4069.56 --> 4070.64]  is characterized
[4070.64 --> 4071.88]  by witness.
[4072.12 --> 4072.46]  Sometimes
[4072.46 --> 4073.14]  we have
[4073.14 --> 4074.48]  this idea
[4074.48 --> 4074.84]  in the
[4074.84 --> 4075.46]  church that
[4075.46 --> 4076.22]  mission,
[4076.74 --> 4077.36]  or missions
[4077.36 --> 4078.00]  is done
[4078.00 --> 4078.40]  by a
[4078.40 --> 4078.72]  committee
[4078.72 --> 4079.16]  or by
[4079.16 --> 4079.70]  a team
[4079.70 --> 4080.28]  or by
[4080.28 --> 4080.82]  a pastor
[4080.82 --> 4081.24]  or by
[4081.24 --> 4081.68]  a staff
[4081.68 --> 4082.04]  person
[4082.04 --> 4082.34]  or by
[4082.34 --> 4082.66]  someone
[4082.66 --> 4083.06]  we sent
[4083.06 --> 4083.66]  to Mexico
[4083.66 --> 4084.44]  or to
[4084.44 --> 4085.00]  Costa Rica
[4085.00 --> 4085.94]  or across
[4085.94 --> 4086.30]  the world
[4086.30 --> 4086.68]  somewhere.
[4088.54 --> 4089.02]  You
[4089.02 --> 4090.22]  are
[4090.22 --> 4091.14]  sent.
[4091.90 --> 4092.54]  Every one
[4092.54 --> 4092.94]  of us
[4092.94 --> 4093.90]  is sent.
[4094.06 --> 4094.60]  This is
[4094.60 --> 4095.82]  foundational
[4095.82 --> 4096.84]  to what
[4096.84 --> 4097.30]  it means
[4097.30 --> 4097.98]  to be
[4097.98 --> 4098.90]  the called
[4098.90 --> 4099.96]  out ones.
[4100.66 --> 4100.94]  Called
[4100.94 --> 4101.90]  out of
[4101.90 --> 4102.42]  the world,
[4102.62 --> 4102.88]  called
[4102.88 --> 4103.64]  out of
[4103.64 --> 4104.06]  our sin,
[4104.26 --> 4104.54]  called
[4104.54 --> 4105.02]  out of
[4105.02 --> 4105.50]  darkness
[4105.50 --> 4106.58]  and sent
[4106.58 --> 4107.76]  with the
[4107.76 --> 4108.06]  message
[4108.06 --> 4108.60]  of his
[4108.60 --> 4109.50]  redemption,
[4110.12 --> 4110.38]  sent
[4110.38 --> 4110.72]  with the
[4110.72 --> 4111.14]  gospel
[4111.14 --> 4112.08]  of his
[4112.08 --> 4113.20]  salvation.
[4114.42 --> 4115.12]  So again,
[4115.26 --> 4115.82]  my hope
[4115.82 --> 4116.22]  over the
[4116.22 --> 4116.74]  next year
[4116.74 --> 4117.16]  is to run
[4117.16 --> 4117.76]  experiments
[4117.76 --> 4118.32]  and micro
[4118.32 --> 4118.78]  experiments
[4118.78 --> 4119.20]  about how
[4119.20 --> 4119.74]  we might
[4119.74 --> 4120.76]  do this,
[4121.16 --> 4121.44]  about how
[4121.44 --> 4121.76]  we can
[4121.76 --> 4122.24]  live into
[4122.24 --> 4122.66]  this
[4122.66 --> 4123.82]  identity
[4123.82 --> 4125.12]  together
[4125.12 --> 4125.72]  as our
[4125.72 --> 4126.50]  shared
[4126.50 --> 4127.16]  life
[4127.16 --> 4127.76]  also
[4127.76 --> 4128.62]  includes
[4128.62 --> 4129.50]  being
[4129.50 --> 4130.42]  sent.
[4130.42 --> 4131.88]  And
[4131.88 --> 4132.50]  then lastly,
[4133.40 --> 4133.58]  our
[4133.58 --> 4134.06]  shared
[4134.06 --> 4134.92]  life
[4134.92 --> 4135.38]  is
[4135.38 --> 4136.08]  collective,
[4136.68 --> 4137.12]  it is
[4137.12 --> 4138.14]  contrastive,
[4138.44 --> 4138.98]  it is
[4138.98 --> 4139.34]  called
[4139.34 --> 4139.74]  out,
[4140.12 --> 4140.62]  and then
[4140.62 --> 4141.60]  when all
[4141.60 --> 4142.10]  of those
[4142.10 --> 4142.82]  things come
[4142.82 --> 4143.38]  together,
[4143.68 --> 4144.32]  I really
[4144.32 --> 4145.20]  believe it
[4145.20 --> 4145.52]  is
[4145.52 --> 4146.34]  compelling.
[4147.42 --> 4147.92]  It is
[4147.92 --> 4148.34]  compelling.
[4148.58 --> 4148.78]  Notice
[4148.78 --> 4149.84]  what Paul
[4149.84 --> 4151.42]  has written.
[4152.16 --> 4152.80]  Whatever
[4152.80 --> 4153.50]  happens,
[4153.96 --> 4154.22]  conduct
[4154.22 --> 4154.86]  yourselves
[4154.86 --> 4155.22]  in a
[4155.22 --> 4155.48]  manner
[4155.48 --> 4156.08]  worthy
[4156.08 --> 4156.38]  of the
[4156.38 --> 4156.68]  gospel
[4156.68 --> 4157.22]  of Christ.
[4157.22 --> 4157.94]  Then
[4157.94 --> 4158.38]  whether
[4158.38 --> 4159.14]  I come
[4159.14 --> 4159.64]  and see
[4159.64 --> 4159.96]  you or
[4159.96 --> 4160.48]  only hear
[4160.48 --> 4160.86]  about you
[4160.86 --> 4161.14]  in my
[4161.14 --> 4161.46]  absence,
[4161.60 --> 4162.38]  I will
[4162.38 --> 4162.98]  know.
[4163.88 --> 4164.06]  There is
[4164.06 --> 4164.24]  something
[4164.24 --> 4164.82]  compelling
[4164.82 --> 4165.84]  about being
[4165.84 --> 4166.60]  called to
[4166.60 --> 4167.08]  conduct
[4167.08 --> 4167.64]  ourselves
[4167.64 --> 4168.08]  worthy
[4168.08 --> 4168.50]  and then
[4168.50 --> 4168.96]  seeing
[4168.96 --> 4169.18]  that
[4169.18 --> 4169.54]  happen.
[4169.90 --> 4169.98]  And
[4169.98 --> 4170.12]  there is
[4170.12 --> 4170.30]  something
[4170.30 --> 4170.78]  compelling
[4170.78 --> 4171.12]  about
[4171.12 --> 4171.60]  hearing
[4171.60 --> 4171.94]  that
[4171.94 --> 4172.58]  happening
[4172.58 --> 4172.90]  in the
[4172.90 --> 4173.22]  lives
[4173.22 --> 4173.40]  of
[4173.40 --> 4173.78]  people
[4173.78 --> 4174.36]  and
[4174.36 --> 4174.74]  seeing
[4174.74 --> 4175.02]  that
[4175.02 --> 4175.36]  happen
[4175.36 --> 4175.88]  in the
[4175.88 --> 4176.12]  lives
[4176.12 --> 4176.30]  of
[4176.30 --> 4176.64]  people
[4176.64 --> 4177.14]  and
[4177.14 --> 4177.34]  then
[4177.34 --> 4177.86]  striving
[4177.86 --> 4178.32]  together
[4178.32 --> 4178.60]  as
[4178.60 --> 4178.90]  one
[4178.90 --> 4179.10]  for
[4179.10 --> 4179.24]  the
[4179.24 --> 4179.48]  faith
[4179.48 --> 4179.62]  in
[4179.62 --> 4179.74]  the
[4179.74 --> 4180.08]  gospel
[4180.08 --> 4180.80]  without
[4180.80 --> 4181.36]  being
[4181.36 --> 4181.86]  frightened
[4181.86 --> 4182.24]  in
[4182.24 --> 4182.64]  any
[4182.64 --> 4183.00]  way
[4183.00 --> 4184.16]  by those
[4184.16 --> 4184.30]  who
[4184.30 --> 4184.66]  oppose
[4184.66 --> 4184.88]  you.
[4185.96 --> 4186.18]  A
[4186.18 --> 4186.52]  church
[4186.52 --> 4187.24]  unafraid
[4187.24 --> 4187.68]  of
[4187.68 --> 4188.14]  this
[4188.14 --> 4188.78]  calling
[4188.78 --> 4189.62]  is
[4189.62 --> 4190.78]  compelling.
[4192.24 --> 4192.54]  And
[4192.54 --> 4192.84]  again,
[4194.54 --> 4194.82]  right,
[4194.92 --> 4195.44]  this is
[4195.44 --> 4195.76]  our
[4195.76 --> 4196.18]  gather,
[4196.38 --> 4196.60]  grow,
[4196.74 --> 4197.04]  go
[4197.04 --> 4197.58]  all
[4197.58 --> 4198.00]  together.
[4198.82 --> 4199.48]  And
[4199.48 --> 4199.86]  yes,
[4200.02 --> 4200.50]  this too
[4200.50 --> 4201.56]  is all
[4201.56 --> 4202.14]  over
[4202.14 --> 4202.74]  the
[4202.74 --> 4203.14]  Bible.
[4203.88 --> 4204.24]  Let me
[4204.24 --> 4204.64]  show you
[4204.64 --> 4205.34]  just two.
[4206.02 --> 4206.24]  Matthew
[4206.24 --> 4206.74]  5,
[4206.82 --> 4207.38]  16.
[4207.58 --> 4207.84]  In the
[4207.84 --> 4208.50]  same way,
[4208.64 --> 4209.00]  let your
[4209.00 --> 4209.76]  light shine
[4209.76 --> 4210.60]  before others
[4210.60 --> 4211.02]  that they
[4211.02 --> 4211.58]  may see
[4211.58 --> 4212.16]  your good
[4212.16 --> 4212.56]  deeds
[4212.56 --> 4213.96]  and glorify
[4213.96 --> 4214.54]  your
[4214.54 --> 4214.94]  Father
[4214.94 --> 4215.68]  in heaven.
[4216.52 --> 4216.82]  And
[4216.82 --> 4217.42]  1 Peter,
[4217.50 --> 4217.76]  I think
[4217.76 --> 4218.06]  we read
[4218.06 --> 4218.42]  this already,
[4218.52 --> 4218.88]  live such
[4218.88 --> 4219.38]  good lives
[4219.38 --> 4219.74]  among the
[4219.74 --> 4220.16]  pagans that
[4220.16 --> 4220.42]  though they
[4220.42 --> 4220.94]  accuse you
[4220.94 --> 4221.24]  of doing
[4221.24 --> 4221.62]  wrong,
[4221.98 --> 4222.26]  they may
[4222.26 --> 4222.78]  see your
[4222.78 --> 4223.34]  good deeds
[4223.34 --> 4224.52]  and glorify
[4224.52 --> 4225.18]  God on
[4225.18 --> 4225.56]  the day
[4225.56 --> 4226.56]  he visits.
[4227.98 --> 4228.34]  Doing
[4228.34 --> 4228.92]  these
[4228.92 --> 4229.52]  good
[4229.52 --> 4230.20]  deeds,
[4230.38 --> 4231.10]  living in
[4231.10 --> 4231.54]  this
[4231.54 --> 4232.20]  shared
[4232.20 --> 4232.80]  life
[4232.80 --> 4233.36]  together,
[4233.36 --> 4234.08]  is
[4234.08 --> 4234.74]  compelling
[4234.74 --> 4235.74]  to the
[4235.74 --> 4235.92]  world
[4235.92 --> 4236.22]  around
[4236.22 --> 4236.56]  us.
[4236.96 --> 4237.06]  And
[4237.06 --> 4237.26]  again,
[4237.34 --> 4237.76]  this has
[4237.76 --> 4238.32]  been the
[4238.32 --> 4238.78]  testimony
[4238.78 --> 4239.80]  of the
[4239.80 --> 4240.28]  church
[4240.28 --> 4240.90]  for
[4240.90 --> 4241.96]  generations
[4241.96 --> 4242.62]  and
[4242.62 --> 4243.34]  millennia.
[4243.34 --> 4245.64]  again,
[4245.76 --> 4246.10]  I quoted
[4246.10 --> 4246.40]  this
[4246.40 --> 4246.80]  yesterday,
[4246.96 --> 4247.40]  but as
[4247.40 --> 4248.30]  Paul already
[4248.30 --> 4248.86]  alluded to,
[4248.98 --> 4249.38]  these things
[4249.38 --> 4250.08]  are returning,
[4250.24 --> 4250.66]  these themes
[4250.66 --> 4251.62]  are repeating,
[4251.94 --> 4252.68]  and so we
[4252.68 --> 4253.50]  listen with
[4253.50 --> 4254.40]  careful ears.
[4255.38 --> 4256.00]  The Roman
[4256.00 --> 4256.58]  emperor
[4256.58 --> 4257.26]  Julian,
[4258.38 --> 4258.92]  who
[4258.92 --> 4260.26]  reigned in
[4260.26 --> 4260.76]  the fourth
[4260.76 --> 4261.34]  century,
[4261.72 --> 4262.24]  who had
[4262.24 --> 4263.02]  no love
[4263.02 --> 4263.78]  loss for
[4263.78 --> 4264.28]  Christians,
[4264.78 --> 4265.58]  and worked
[4265.58 --> 4266.00]  and took
[4266.00 --> 4266.34]  it upon
[4266.34 --> 4267.18]  himself to
[4267.18 --> 4268.20]  bring a
[4268.20 --> 4268.94]  resurgence,
[4269.16 --> 4270.32]  a revitalization,
[4270.48 --> 4271.08]  a revival,
[4271.26 --> 4271.70]  if you will,
[4271.70 --> 4272.38]  of the
[4272.38 --> 4272.98]  Roman
[4272.98 --> 4273.76]  religion,
[4273.90 --> 4274.24]  the Roman
[4274.24 --> 4275.00]  pantheon.
[4275.70 --> 4276.82]  He was
[4276.82 --> 4277.96]  the
[4277.96 --> 4279.02]  Josiah of
[4279.02 --> 4279.36]  the Old
[4279.36 --> 4280.08]  Testament to
[4280.08 --> 4280.46]  the Roman
[4280.46 --> 4280.90]  Empire.
[4281.20 --> 4281.66]  That was
[4281.66 --> 4282.16]  his goal,
[4282.44 --> 4283.44]  to restore
[4283.44 --> 4284.78]  to Rome
[4284.78 --> 4285.82]  the practice
[4285.82 --> 4286.36]  of their
[4286.36 --> 4286.74]  pagan
[4286.74 --> 4287.56]  religion.
[4287.70 --> 4287.96]  And he
[4287.96 --> 4288.48]  writes a
[4288.48 --> 4288.86]  letter that
[4288.86 --> 4289.28]  we have
[4289.28 --> 4289.80]  saved in
[4289.80 --> 4291.04]  history to
[4291.04 --> 4291.44]  the high
[4291.44 --> 4292.52]  priest of
[4292.52 --> 4293.02]  Galatia.
[4293.94 --> 4294.64]  He says,
[4294.88 --> 4295.90]  of Christians,
[4296.06 --> 4296.70]  it is their
[4296.70 --> 4297.64]  benevolence to
[4297.64 --> 4298.12]  strangers,
[4298.68 --> 4299.34]  their care for
[4299.34 --> 4299.90]  the graves of
[4299.90 --> 4300.26]  the dead,
[4300.38 --> 4300.92]  their pretended
[4300.92 --> 4301.68]  holiness of
[4301.68 --> 4302.14]  their lives,
[4302.24 --> 4302.72]  that have
[4302.72 --> 4303.48]  done most to
[4303.48 --> 4304.10]  increase
[4304.10 --> 4304.76]  atheism.
[4305.54 --> 4305.66]  Now,
[4305.68 --> 4306.54]  atheism is what
[4306.54 --> 4306.90]  the Romans
[4306.90 --> 4307.90]  called Christianity
[4307.90 --> 4309.32]  because we only
[4309.32 --> 4310.10]  worship one God.
[4310.72 --> 4311.08]  And so they
[4311.08 --> 4311.60]  thought that was
[4311.60 --> 4311.96]  atheist.
[4312.82 --> 4313.48]  He goes on to
[4313.48 --> 4313.96]  say that,
[4314.36 --> 4315.26]  I believe we,
[4315.58 --> 4316.26]  the pagans,
[4316.76 --> 4318.10]  ought really to
[4318.10 --> 4319.36]  truly practice
[4319.36 --> 4320.14]  every one of
[4320.14 --> 4320.72]  these virtues.
[4322.14 --> 4322.64]  And so what
[4322.64 --> 4323.80]  he's saying is
[4323.80 --> 4324.06]  that,
[4324.30 --> 4324.70]  you see what
[4324.70 --> 4325.24]  those Christians
[4325.24 --> 4325.70]  are doing?
[4326.30 --> 4327.06]  That's exactly
[4327.06 --> 4327.56]  what we need
[4327.56 --> 4327.90]  to do.
[4329.08 --> 4329.58]  And it was
[4329.58 --> 4330.50]  compelling to
[4330.50 --> 4330.76]  him.
[4331.68 --> 4332.46]  Even if
[4332.46 --> 4333.16]  he longed
[4333.16 --> 4334.20]  for an
[4334.20 --> 4334.90]  application in
[4334.90 --> 4335.26]  a totally
[4335.26 --> 4335.56]  different
[4335.56 --> 4336.00]  direction.
[4337.64 --> 4339.26]  He is
[4339.26 --> 4340.82]  seeing that
[4340.82 --> 4341.56]  our shared
[4341.56 --> 4342.68]  life together
[4342.68 --> 4343.80]  as a witness
[4343.80 --> 4345.66]  is compelling,
[4347.14 --> 4348.20]  draws people
[4348.20 --> 4349.16]  into who
[4349.16 --> 4350.16]  Jesus is.
[4350.24 --> 4350.82]  He says
[4350.82 --> 4353.54]  that we
[4353.54 --> 4354.22]  ought to
[4354.22 --> 4355.18]  practice every
[4355.18 --> 4356.02]  one of these
[4356.02 --> 4356.92]  virtues.
[4356.92 --> 4356.98]  believers.
[4357.56 --> 4357.94]  And so,
[4358.72 --> 4360.74]  if you're
[4360.74 --> 4361.46]  here today
[4361.46 --> 4362.40]  and your
[4362.40 --> 4363.18]  practice of
[4363.18 --> 4363.72]  Christianity
[4363.72 --> 4364.78]  has not
[4364.78 --> 4365.42]  included these
[4365.42 --> 4365.84]  virtues,
[4366.24 --> 4366.74]  has not
[4366.74 --> 4367.36]  included these
[4367.36 --> 4367.90]  disciplines,
[4368.84 --> 4369.32]  maybe it
[4369.32 --> 4369.70]  takes the
[4369.70 --> 4370.18]  word of a
[4370.18 --> 4370.78]  pagan emperor
[4370.78 --> 4371.96]  to call you
[4371.96 --> 4372.30]  back to
[4372.30 --> 4372.68]  service,
[4373.44 --> 4374.44]  to call you
[4374.44 --> 4374.86]  out on
[4374.86 --> 4375.70]  witness and
[4375.70 --> 4376.74]  mission with
[4376.74 --> 4377.06]  Jesus.
[4377.74 --> 4378.38]  For this is
[4378.38 --> 4378.90]  who we are.
[4380.28 --> 4380.50]  Jeff
[4380.50 --> 4381.02]  Vanderstelt
[4381.02 --> 4381.88]  summarizes all
[4381.88 --> 4382.20]  of this.
[4382.30 --> 4382.64]  He says,
[4382.64 --> 4383.16]  live your
[4383.16 --> 4383.80]  lives in
[4383.80 --> 4384.40]  such a way
[4384.40 --> 4384.78]  that it
[4384.78 --> 4386.02]  demands a
[4386.02 --> 4386.52]  gospel
[4386.52 --> 4387.50]  explanation.
[4388.62 --> 4389.14]  That's our
[4389.14 --> 4390.04]  goal in
[4390.04 --> 4390.50]  this next
[4390.50 --> 4390.94]  year, that
[4390.94 --> 4391.76]  together we
[4391.76 --> 4392.28]  live our
[4392.28 --> 4392.74]  lives in
[4392.74 --> 4393.26]  such a way
[4393.26 --> 4393.54]  that no
[4393.54 --> 4393.96]  matter where
[4393.96 --> 4394.46]  we are,
[4395.42 --> 4396.62]  it demands
[4396.62 --> 4397.10]  a gospel
[4397.10 --> 4397.76]  explanation.
[4399.40 --> 4399.96]  We're going
[4399.96 --> 4400.40]  to live in
[4400.40 --> 4400.90]  this way,
[4401.38 --> 4402.10]  and I hope
[4402.10 --> 4402.84]  and pray
[4402.84 --> 4403.60]  that you
[4403.60 --> 4404.36]  will follow
[4404.36 --> 4405.34]  along.
[4405.70 --> 4406.18]  But not only
[4406.18 --> 4406.68]  follow, I
[4406.68 --> 4407.22]  hope and pray
[4407.22 --> 4407.66]  that you will
[4407.66 --> 4408.78]  lead in this
[4408.78 --> 4409.46]  direction or
[4409.46 --> 4410.32]  lead in this
[4410.32 --> 4410.78]  area, that
[4410.78 --> 4411.90]  you will stand
[4411.90 --> 4412.44]  out there and
[4412.44 --> 4413.62]  call us
[4413.62 --> 4415.36]  towards where
[4415.36 --> 4415.78]  God has
[4415.78 --> 4416.28]  called you,
[4417.00 --> 4417.50]  because we
[4417.50 --> 4418.14]  do this
[4418.14 --> 4419.04]  together.
[4420.46 --> 4421.02]  I'm going to
[4421.02 --> 4421.94]  end here and
[4421.94 --> 4422.74]  want to
[4422.74 --> 4423.26]  introduce
[4423.26 --> 4423.96]  something to
[4423.96 --> 4424.12]  you.
[4424.96 --> 4425.52]  I've been
[4425.52 --> 4426.04]  communicating
[4426.04 --> 4426.54]  with the
[4426.54 --> 4427.08]  liturgical
[4427.08 --> 4427.92]  arts team,
[4428.96 --> 4430.32]  and we
[4430.32 --> 4431.02]  are working
[4431.02 --> 4431.82]  on a way
[4431.82 --> 4433.88]  to remind
[4433.88 --> 4434.82]  us of
[4434.82 --> 4436.06]  this mission,
[4436.36 --> 4437.00]  remind us
[4437.00 --> 4437.62]  of this
[4437.62 --> 4438.50]  shared life
[4438.50 --> 4439.18]  and witness
[4439.18 --> 4439.90]  to wherever
[4439.90 --> 4440.68]  we go
[4440.68 --> 4442.12]  each week
[4442.12 --> 4442.76]  over the
[4442.76 --> 4443.10]  course of
[4443.10 --> 4443.36]  the next
[4443.36 --> 4443.60]  year.
[4444.66 --> 4445.12]  And so,
[4445.36 --> 4445.92]  what we
[4445.92 --> 4446.44]  are asking
[4446.44 --> 4447.04]  of you
[4447.04 --> 4447.76]  is for
[4447.76 --> 4448.48]  you to
[4448.48 --> 4449.78]  take a
[4449.78 --> 4450.92]  picture of
[4450.92 --> 4451.54]  a place
[4451.54 --> 4452.38]  that you
[4452.38 --> 4453.26]  love,
[4453.34 --> 4454.06]  or a place
[4454.06 --> 4454.48]  that has
[4454.48 --> 4455.14]  meaning to
[4455.14 --> 4455.66]  you,
[4456.06 --> 4456.80]  either in
[4456.80 --> 4457.26]  our church
[4457.26 --> 4457.68]  neighborhood,
[4457.98 --> 4458.36]  or in the
[4458.36 --> 4458.68]  neighborhoods
[4458.68 --> 4459.32]  around your
[4459.32 --> 4459.78]  homes,
[4460.10 --> 4460.68]  or your
[4460.68 --> 4460.98]  work
[4460.98 --> 4461.54]  neighborhoods,
[4461.90 --> 4462.54]  a place
[4462.54 --> 4462.90]  that has
[4462.90 --> 4463.54]  meaning to
[4463.54 --> 4463.98]  you,
[4464.78 --> 4465.52]  and somewhere
[4465.52 --> 4465.98]  that you
[4465.98 --> 4467.34]  return to,
[4467.44 --> 4467.98]  that you do
[4467.98 --> 4468.82]  life in,
[4468.82 --> 4470.30]  we want
[4470.30 --> 4470.48]  you to
[4470.48 --> 4470.76]  take a
[4470.76 --> 4471.18]  picture of
[4471.18 --> 4471.40]  that.
[4472.28 --> 4472.50]  And so,
[4472.58 --> 4473.18]  maybe it's
[4473.18 --> 4473.56]  a park
[4473.56 --> 4474.22]  bench that
[4474.22 --> 4474.46]  you love
[4474.46 --> 4474.78]  to sit
[4474.78 --> 4474.98]  on,
[4475.04 --> 4475.18]  or you
[4475.18 --> 4475.48]  love to
[4475.48 --> 4475.86]  meet someone
[4475.86 --> 4476.20]  at and
[4476.20 --> 4476.46]  have a
[4476.46 --> 4476.90]  conversation
[4476.90 --> 4477.22]  with,
[4477.62 --> 4478.10]  maybe it's
[4478.10 --> 4478.54]  a hike
[4478.54 --> 4478.92]  that you
[4478.92 --> 4479.28]  like to
[4479.28 --> 4479.58]  walk,
[4480.10 --> 4481.02]  maybe it's
[4481.02 --> 4481.32]  your
[4481.32 --> 4481.98]  workplace,
[4482.68 --> 4483.62]  maybe it's
[4483.62 --> 4484.12]  Starbucks,
[4484.40 --> 4484.94]  or a corner
[4484.94 --> 4485.66]  of Starbucks,
[4486.22 --> 4486.76]  maybe it's a
[4486.76 --> 4487.30]  sports field,
[4487.42 --> 4487.80]  or a rink,
[4487.88 --> 4488.30]  or a running
[4488.30 --> 4488.66]  track,
[4488.76 --> 4489.20]  or a park
[4489.20 --> 4489.46]  that you
[4489.46 --> 4489.84]  play at,
[4489.86 --> 4490.22]  or a pool
[4490.22 --> 4490.66]  you like to
[4490.66 --> 4491.06]  swim in,
[4491.36 --> 4492.28]  wherever you
[4492.28 --> 4492.80]  spend your
[4492.80 --> 4493.28]  time,
[4494.58 --> 4494.82]  right,
[4494.82 --> 4495.34]  whether that's
[4495.34 --> 4497.00]  on Saturday
[4497.00 --> 4497.94]  at Porter's,
[4498.10 --> 4499.16]  or on Tuesday
[4499.16 --> 4500.00]  at A and W
[4500.00 --> 4500.68]  for breakfast,
[4500.98 --> 4501.32]  or wherever
[4501.32 --> 4501.80]  you spend
[4501.80 --> 4502.28]  your time,
[4503.00 --> 4503.62]  that's your
[4503.62 --> 4504.32]  mission field,
[4505.04 --> 4506.12]  that's where
[4506.12 --> 4506.82]  you are sent,
[4507.64 --> 4508.58]  that is where
[4508.58 --> 4509.42]  you are called
[4509.42 --> 4510.10]  to gather,
[4510.52 --> 4510.74]  grow,
[4510.88 --> 4511.34]  and go.
[4512.50 --> 4512.80]  And so,
[4512.86 --> 4513.16]  we're going to
[4513.16 --> 4513.68]  ask you to
[4513.68 --> 4514.18]  submit those
[4514.18 --> 4514.62]  pictures,
[4515.14 --> 4515.78]  and then we're
[4515.78 --> 4516.12]  going to put
[4516.12 --> 4517.10]  them up along
[4517.10 --> 4518.46]  the back wall
[4518.46 --> 4519.10]  on the valence
[4519.10 --> 4519.58]  or above,
[4519.66 --> 4519.98]  we're still
[4519.98 --> 4520.50]  working out the
[4520.50 --> 4520.88]  details,
[4521.44 --> 4522.54]  and throughout
[4522.54 --> 4523.18]  it will say
[4523.18 --> 4523.52]  gather,
[4523.98 --> 4524.22]  grow,
[4524.56 --> 4524.80]  go,
[4524.82 --> 4524.94]  grow,
[4525.44 --> 4525.82]  hear.
[4527.32 --> 4527.94]  And so,
[4528.02 --> 4528.40]  we're taking
[4528.40 --> 4528.98]  the mission
[4528.98 --> 4529.46]  statement of
[4529.46 --> 4530.00]  this church,
[4530.04 --> 4530.46]  and we are
[4530.46 --> 4531.86]  walking out
[4531.86 --> 4532.52]  under it
[4532.52 --> 4533.32]  each week,
[4533.68 --> 4534.76]  so that those
[4534.76 --> 4535.30]  places,
[4536.18 --> 4537.10]  your hears,
[4537.38 --> 4537.84]  wherever that
[4537.84 --> 4538.18]  is,
[4538.48 --> 4539.18]  is where you
[4539.18 --> 4539.90]  are witnessing
[4539.90 --> 4540.70]  in shared
[4540.70 --> 4541.28]  life,
[4541.32 --> 4541.74]  and where you
[4541.74 --> 4542.80]  are reminded,
[4543.22 --> 4543.42]  right?
[4543.46 --> 4543.62]  So,
[4543.74 --> 4544.18]  wherever you
[4544.18 --> 4544.42]  are,
[4544.56 --> 4545.14]  wherever you
[4545.14 --> 4546.10]  already love,
[4546.84 --> 4547.54]  that's where
[4547.54 --> 4548.14]  God is sending
[4548.14 --> 4548.38]  you.
[4549.60 --> 4550.04]  And so,
[4550.10 --> 4550.24]  please,
[4550.32 --> 4550.80]  take a picture
[4550.80 --> 4551.18]  of it,
[4551.72 --> 4552.32]  and send it
[4552.32 --> 4552.50]  in,
[4552.56 --> 4553.02]  you can send
[4553.02 --> 4553.46]  it in via
[4553.46 --> 4554.34]  email to
[4554.34 --> 4555.44]  communications
[4555.44 --> 4555.92]  at
[4555.92 --> 4557.34]  l-i-c-r-c.ca,
[4557.50 --> 4557.96]  or you can
[4557.96 --> 4558.50]  text it to
[4558.50 --> 4558.76]  me,
[4558.92 --> 4559.40]  and then I
[4559.40 --> 4559.86]  will forward
[4559.86 --> 4560.12]  it,
[4560.30 --> 4560.88]  and we will
[4560.88 --> 4561.88]  gather them
[4561.88 --> 4562.18]  up,
[4562.80 --> 4563.62]  and we will
[4563.62 --> 4565.20]  work on this
[4565.20 --> 4566.22]  installation
[4566.22 --> 4567.46]  together.
[4567.80 --> 4568.22]  You will get
[4568.22 --> 4568.98]  regular reminders
[4568.98 --> 4569.70]  for this,
[4569.84 --> 4570.30]  but if you were
[4570.30 --> 4571.22]  to send an
[4571.22 --> 4572.08]  influx of two
[4572.08 --> 4572.68]  or three hundred
[4572.68 --> 4573.52]  pictures over the
[4573.52 --> 4573.94]  next week,
[4574.02 --> 4574.64]  then the liturgical
[4574.64 --> 4575.20]  arts team would
[4575.20 --> 4575.58]  know how much
[4575.58 --> 4576.16]  wall space they
[4576.16 --> 4576.34]  need.
[4576.34 --> 4581.24]  as we go
[4581.24 --> 4583.28]  in this
[4583.28 --> 4584.42]  shared life,
[4585.26 --> 4586.04]  this table
[4586.04 --> 4587.68]  becomes for us
[4587.68 --> 4588.32]  a picture
[4588.32 --> 4589.34]  of what's
[4589.34 --> 4589.66]  happening.
[4590.26 --> 4590.66]  So,
[4590.72 --> 4591.12]  we gather
[4591.12 --> 4591.86]  around this
[4591.86 --> 4592.58]  table to be
[4592.58 --> 4593.66]  sustained and
[4593.66 --> 4594.14]  nourished,
[4594.18 --> 4594.68]  and then we
[4594.68 --> 4596.00]  go to our
[4596.00 --> 4596.84]  various other
[4596.84 --> 4597.26]  tables,
[4597.56 --> 4598.82]  and we gather
[4598.82 --> 4599.50]  around them,
[4599.68 --> 4600.32]  and we share
[4600.32 --> 4600.80]  what happens
[4600.80 --> 4601.06]  here.
[4601.80 --> 4602.00]  And so,
[4602.08 --> 4602.52]  as we come
[4602.52 --> 4603.22]  to this table
[4603.22 --> 4604.12]  in our Lord's
[4604.12 --> 4604.68]  Supper now,
[4604.68 --> 4606.90]  keep that in
[4606.90 --> 4607.54]  your mind,
[4608.02 --> 4608.60]  that as you
[4608.60 --> 4609.36]  gather here,
[4610.02 --> 4610.26]  right,
[4610.34 --> 4611.84]  as Jesus is
[4611.84 --> 4612.82]  revealed to you
[4612.82 --> 4613.32]  in the breaking
[4613.32 --> 4614.02]  of bread and
[4614.02 --> 4614.74]  the drinking
[4614.74 --> 4615.46]  of the juice,
[4616.28 --> 4617.62]  be inspired
[4617.62 --> 4619.00]  to go and
[4619.00 --> 4620.02]  reveal Him
[4620.02 --> 4620.92]  wherever you
[4620.92 --> 4621.48]  break bread,
[4622.06 --> 4622.44]  wherever you
[4622.44 --> 4623.14]  drink juice
[4623.14 --> 4624.14]  throughout the
[4624.14 --> 4624.40]  week.
[4625.26 --> 4625.50]  Amen?
[4626.70 --> 4627.30]  Amen.
[4627.48 --> 4628.14]  Let me lead
[4628.14 --> 4628.68]  you in prayer.
[4632.82 --> 4633.80]  Holy God,
[4633.80 --> 4634.94]  Heavenly Father,
[4635.72 --> 4636.82]  we come to
[4636.82 --> 4637.62]  you now at
[4637.62 --> 4638.18]  this time
[4638.18 --> 4640.02]  because you
[4640.02 --> 4641.04]  have first
[4641.04 --> 4642.12]  come to
[4642.12 --> 4642.48]  us.
[4643.78 --> 4644.56]  And so,
[4644.64 --> 4644.92]  we pray,
[4645.04 --> 4645.54]  Lord God,
[4645.92 --> 4646.94]  build us
[4646.94 --> 4647.44]  up.
[4649.26 --> 4650.10]  Build us
[4650.10 --> 4650.56]  up and
[4650.56 --> 4651.22]  draw us
[4651.22 --> 4651.88]  closer to
[4651.88 --> 4652.40]  you and
[4652.40 --> 4653.48]  closer to
[4653.48 --> 4653.84]  each other,
[4653.90 --> 4654.30]  that our
[4654.30 --> 4655.20]  shared life
[4655.20 --> 4655.58]  might,
[4655.90 --> 4656.16]  in fact,
[4656.24 --> 4656.86]  be a
[4656.86 --> 4658.10]  witness to
[4658.10 --> 4658.48]  the world.
[4660.62 --> 4661.56]  That as we
[4661.56 --> 4662.94]  display our
[4662.94 --> 4664.02]  collective
[4664.02 --> 4665.14]  lives together,
[4665.22 --> 4665.56]  as we
[4665.56 --> 4666.26]  display our
[4666.26 --> 4667.08]  contrastive,
[4667.44 --> 4667.86]  called-out
[4667.86 --> 4668.20]  lives,
[4668.26 --> 4668.58]  that they
[4668.58 --> 4669.18]  would be
[4669.18 --> 4669.92]  compelling
[4669.92 --> 4671.60]  to a world
[4671.60 --> 4672.46]  that is hungry
[4672.46 --> 4673.26]  to encounter
[4673.26 --> 4673.62]  you.
[4674.34 --> 4675.38]  Use us
[4675.38 --> 4677.40]  that people
[4677.40 --> 4678.26]  might see
[4678.26 --> 4678.86]  you,
[4679.20 --> 4679.64]  Lord Jesus.
[4680.80 --> 4681.58]  Nourish us
[4681.58 --> 4682.34]  at this table
[4682.34 --> 4683.70]  that we
[4683.70 --> 4684.40]  might go
[4684.40 --> 4685.08]  and be
[4685.08 --> 4685.68]  salt and
[4685.68 --> 4686.68]  light in
[4686.68 --> 4687.04]  the world.
[4687.78 --> 4688.26]  In Jesus'
[4688.46 --> 4688.76]  name we
[4688.76 --> 4689.00]  pray.
[4689.66 --> 4690.04]  Amen.
[4690.04 --> 4690.12]  Amen.
[4690.12 --> 4690.16]  Amen.
[4690.16 --> 4690.18]  Amen.
[4690.18 --> 4690.20]  Amen.
[4690.20 --> 4690.24]  Amen.
[4692.94 --> 4693.38]  Amen.
[4704.18 --> 4705.52]  Come send
[4705.52 --> 4706.30]  your rule
[4706.30 --> 4707.64]  and reign
[4707.64 --> 4708.98]  in our
[4709.02 --> 4710.06]  hearts
[4710.06 --> 4711.26]  again.
[4711.84 --> 4713.06]  Increase
[4713.06 --> 4713.70]  in us
[4713.70 --> 4714.94]  we pray.
[4715.26 --> 4716.10]  Unveil

[4727.26 --> 4732.50]  Holy Spirit, come, in need of sand
[4732.50 --> 4738.14]  We are your churches
[4738.14 --> 4744.30]  And we need your power in us
[4744.30 --> 4764.30]  We sing your kingdom first, we hunger and we thirst, we refuse to waste our lives, for you're our joy and pride.
[4764.30 --> 4778.22]  To see the captives' hearts to peace, to hurt the sick, the poor at peace, we may tell our lives for heaven's call.
[4780.56 --> 4789.14]  We are your church, we pray revive this earth.
[4794.30 --> 4801.56]  Build your kingdom here, let the darkness hear.
[4801.88 --> 4809.08]  Show your mighty hand, ye Lord's free and land.

[4824.30 --> 4826.30]  We pray.

[4835.82 --> 4839.18]  Reaching the here and far.
[4839.60 --> 4842.72]  No force of crown can stop.
[4843.26 --> 4846.72]  Your beauty changing hearts.
[4846.72 --> 4850.94]  You've made us more much more than this.
[4850.94 --> 4854.74]  A way that he's out seeing us.
[4854.74 --> 4861.36]  Fill us with the strength of our Christ.
[4861.36 --> 4864.98]  We are your church.
[4864.98 --> 4872.18]  We are the hope on earth.
[4872.18 --> 4876.76]  Fill us with the strength of our God.
[4876.76 --> 4879.76]  Build your kingdom here.
[4879.76 --> 4883.32]  Let the darkness hear.
[4883.32 --> 4887.08]  Show your mighty hand.
[4887.48 --> 4890.86]  Heal our streets and land.
[4890.86 --> 4894.56]  Set your church up high.
[4894.56 --> 4898.18]  With this nation back.
[4898.18 --> 4901.94]  Take the atmosphere.
[4902.14 --> 4905.70]  Build your kingdom here.
[4905.70 --> 4907.90]  We pray.
[4907.90 --> 4908.24]  We pray.
[4908.24 --> 4910.08]  We pray.
[4910.08 --> 4912.20]  We pray.
[4912.20 --> 4931.98]  As we come now to the table of our Lord, we have the opportunity to do so together.
[4931.98 --> 4938.70]  And we do so with a little bit of a liturgy words that you are invited to speak and hear
[4938.70 --> 4939.66]  as we go through.
[4939.66 --> 4941.08]  You'll see it on the screen.
[4941.52 --> 4946.24]  Please speak those words that are indicated by people for you to say.
[4947.14 --> 4950.30]  And so we lift up our hearts.
[4950.96 --> 4953.06]  We lift up our hearts.
[4953.06 --> 4955.30]  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
[4955.94 --> 4958.28]  It is right for us to give thanks.
[4958.96 --> 4959.74]  Let's pray together.
[4961.26 --> 4964.76]  With joy, we praise you, gracious God.
[4965.34 --> 4967.90]  For you have created heaven and earth.
[4968.64 --> 4973.50]  You have made us in your image and kept covenant with us even when we fell into sin.
[4974.20 --> 4979.86]  We give you thanks for Jesus Christ, who by his life, death, and resurrection opened to
[4979.86 --> 4982.50]  us the way of life everlasting.
[4983.06 --> 4983.82]  Amen.
[4986.14 --> 4994.12]  Jesus, before he suffered, gave us this memorial of his sacrifice until he comes again.
[4995.00 --> 4999.18]  And the Lord Jesus, on the night that he was betrayed, took bread.
[4999.92 --> 5002.82]  And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said,
[5003.24 --> 5006.10]  This is my body, which is for you.
[5006.76 --> 5009.18]  Do this in remembrance of me.
[5009.18 --> 5015.00]  In the same way, he took the cup after supper and said,
[5015.48 --> 5018.80]  This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[5019.94 --> 5025.14]  Do this whenever you drink it in remembrance of me.
[5025.14 --> 5034.66]  For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes again.
[5035.60 --> 5039.18]  This is the mystery of our faith.
[5039.18 --> 5042.84]  Your death, O Christ, we proclaim.
[5043.46 --> 5045.58]  Your resurrection, we affirm.
[5046.68 --> 5049.12]  Your coming, we await with hope.
[5049.94 --> 5052.06]  Glory be to you, Lord Jesus.
[5052.06 --> 5058.52]  Church family, shared brothers and sisters.
[5058.94 --> 5066.12]  The Lord has prepared his table for all who trust in him, for all who trust in him alone for their salvation.
[5066.12 --> 5072.40]  And so, come to this table, you who have much faith and you who would like to have more.
[5072.96 --> 5081.04]  Come to this table, you who have been to the sacrament often and you who have not been in a long time but are hearing the invitation of Jesus.
[5081.40 --> 5086.08]  Come, you who have tried to follow Jesus and you who have failed.
[5086.26 --> 5090.90]  Come to this table because Jesus Christ is raised.
[5090.90 --> 5097.40]  Come to this table if you are here in person or if you are online and at home.
[5097.68 --> 5102.10]  Because it is Christ who invites us to meet him here.
[5102.86 --> 5106.24]  The gifts of God for the people of God.
[5107.86 --> 5114.56]  As we gather at this table, we do so in a very particular way, meaningful way to us here.
[5114.70 --> 5118.66]  We gather in groups that come up to the front in a circle around the table.
[5118.66 --> 5125.00]  And so, we have elders who will act as ushers indicating when you come up to the front.
[5125.12 --> 5128.20]  And then we have elders who will help serve here at the table.
[5128.38 --> 5133.12]  And so, when you are indicated in your row, please come up to the front and gather around.
[5133.92 --> 5141.58]  As you pass the elements one to the other, we invite you to say, when passing the bread, the body of Christ given for you.
[5141.84 --> 5146.12]  And then when passing the juice, to say, the blood of Christ shed for you.
[5146.12 --> 5153.64]  If you are unable to come up to the front but would like to receive supper, please indicate that to the elder who is out there.
[5153.74 --> 5158.20]  And they will meet you at your spot and they will serve you there.
[5158.94 --> 5162.20]  Additionally, there are people around and available for prayer.
[5162.48 --> 5170.56]  If you would like to receive prayer, to be prayed over or prayed with, either before coming up or if you're not coming up this morning,
[5170.56 --> 5176.04]  there are people who will be available in the foyer at the back to engage you there.
[5176.88 --> 5183.58]  We're going to invite those who are volunteering in the service to come forward, the worship team and the elders who are serving.
[5183.72 --> 5188.88]  We will serve that table first and then they will help facilitate our serving in a moment.
[5189.04 --> 5191.50]  And there will be songs to sing throughout as we go.
[5191.50 --> 5194.14]  So come on down and up to the front.
[5198.86 --> 5200.30]  Come right in here.
[5202.72 --> 5203.34]  He'll come.
[5203.66 --> 5204.54]  Save a spot for him.
[5208.18 --> 5209.24]  He's not going to do it.
[5216.24 --> 5217.60]  Body of Christ given for you.
[5217.60 --> 5217.62]  Thank you.
[5217.62 --> 5217.64]  Thank you.
[5217.64 --> 5217.68]  Thank you.
[5221.50 --> 5223.06]  Body, right.
[5225.56 --> 5230.52]  Right here.
[5243.66 --> 5248.74]  Thank you.
[5251.50 --> 5271.40]  Eat and remember.
[5281.50 --> 5287.98]  Blood of Christ shed for you.
[5292.60 --> 5293.92]  Blood of Christ shed for you.
[5311.50 --> 5341.48]  Blood of Christ shed for you.
[5341.50 --> 5343.52]  Drink and believe.
[5356.62 --> 5359.82]  As this group is making their way back to their seats,
[5360.76 --> 5364.30]  just a reminder that this is a feast unto the Lord,
[5364.42 --> 5366.40]  and so when you're up front, you don't have to whisper to each other.
[5366.40 --> 5371.92]  You could celebrate that this is the blood of Christ shed for you.
[5371.92 --> 5372.92]  Amen.
[5372.92 --> 5373.92]  Amen.
[5402.92 --> 5422.38]  All who are thirsty, all who are weak, come to the fountain, take your heart in the stream of life, and lay out his sorrow.
[5422.38 --> 5444.26]  He washed the earth away in the way that we perceive, as he was down to thee, sing, God, Lord Jesus, come.
[5444.26 --> 5452.26]  Come, Lord Jesus, come.
[5454.26 --> 5461.26]  Come, Lord Jesus, come.
[5463.26 --> 5468.26]  Come, Lord Jesus, come.
[5468.26 --> 5470.26]  Come, Lord Jesus, come.
[5470.26 --> 5489.26]  All who are thirsty, all who are weak, come to the fountain, dip your heart in the stream of life, and lay out his sorrow.
[5489.26 --> 5496.26]  Come, Lord Jesus, come.
[5496.26 --> 5499.26]  Come, Lord Jesus, come.
[5499.26 --> 5504.42]  As he cries out to me
[5504.42 --> 5510.70]  Sing Holy Spirit, Lord
[5510.70 --> 5520.56]  Holy Spirit, Lord
[5520.56 --> 5527.70]  Come, Lord Jesus, Lord
[5527.70 --> 5535.84]  Come, Lord Jesus, Lord
[5535.84 --> 5539.18]  All who are thirsty
[5557.70 --> 5566.84]  Let us pray, pray together
[5566.84 --> 5570.98]  On our knees
[5570.98 --> 5574.98]  Let us pray, pray together
[5574.98 --> 5578.98]  On our knees

[5586.98 --> 5589.12]  And I fall on my knees
[5589.12 --> 5595.12]  O Lord, have mercy on me
[5595.12 --> 5601.80]  Let us drink wine together

[5703.74 --> 5709.26]  And we remember the promise made
[5709.26 --> 5712.32]  That all who come in faith
[5712.32 --> 5718.06]  Find forgiveness at the cost
[5718.06 --> 5724.02]  Though we share in His bread of life
[5724.02 --> 5729.02]  And we dream of His sacrifice
[5729.02 --> 5732.42]  As the sun
