[0.00 → 9.22] Now you stand before the banner, interceding for your own.
[9.72 → 17.00] From each tribe and tongue and nation, you are leading sinners home.
[19.42 → 22.80] You're the author of creation.
[23.62 → 27.04] You're the Lord of every man.
[27.04 → 33.10] And your cry of love rings out across the land.
[34.90 → 38.84] You're the author of creation.
[39.72 → 43.08] You're the Lord of every man.
[43.66 → 49.40] And your cry of love rings out across the land.
[57.04 → 87.02] You're the Lord of every man.
[87.04 → 117.02] You're the Lord of every man.
[117.02 → 119.68] From that darkness we were waiting.
[120.32 → 123.38] Without hope, without light.
[124.08 → 126.78] Till from heaven you came running.
[127.36 → 130.74] There was mercy in your arms.
[131.02 → 134.06] To fulfill the law and promise.
[134.06 → 137.06] To a virgin came the word.
[137.06 → 141.04] From a throne of endless glory.
[141.04 → 144.04] To a cradle in the dirt.
[144.04 → 145.04] Praise the Father.
[145.04 → 146.04] Praise the Son.
[146.04 → 148.04] Praise the Spirit.
[148.04 → 153.04] Praise the Father.
[153.04 → 155.04] Praise the Son.
[155.04 → 157.04] Praise the Spirit.
[157.04 → 161.04] Praise the Spirit.
[161.04 → 164.04] Three in one.
[164.04 → 165.72] Praise the Son.
[165.72 → 168.90] Praise the Spirit.
[168.90 → 169.72] 1968.
[169.72 → 171.76] Praise the Lord.
[171.76 → 173.92] Praise the Spirit.
[173.92 → 174.82] Praise the Lord.
[174.82 → 176.32] Praise the Son.
[176.32 → 179.36] of His.
[182.96 → 186.86] To reveal the kingdom coming
[186.86 → 190.34] and to reconcile the lost,
[190.90 → 193.84] to redeem the whole creation,
[194.40 → 197.46] you did not despise the cross.
[197.46 → 201.10] For even in your suffering,
[201.50 → 204.52] you sought to the other side,
[204.52 → 207.94] knowing this was our salvation,
[208.54 → 211.76] Jesus, for our sake you died.
[217.76 → 224.28] Praise the Father, praise the Son,
[224.28 → 231.28] praise the Spirit, three in one.
[231.28 → 237.74] God of glory, majesty,
[238.74 → 246.34] praise forever to the King of kings.
[246.34 → 253.96] In the morning that He rose,
[253.96 → 257.48] all heaven held its breath,
[257.48 → 260.92] till that stone was moved for good,
[261.30 → 264.62] for the Lamb had conquered death.
[264.62 → 268.10] And the dead rose from their tombs,
[268.10 → 271.58] and the angels stood in awe.
[271.58 → 275.14] For the souls of all who'd come
[275.14 → 278.64] to the Father are restored.
[279.08 → 282.12] And the church of Christ was born,
[282.62 → 285.74] then the Spirit lit the flame.
[285.74 → 289.20] Now this gospel truth of old,
[289.20 → 290.92] shall not kneel,
[290.92 → 292.76] shall not faint.
[292.76 → 296.32] By His blood and in His name,
[296.32 → 299.70] in His freedom I am free.
[299.70 → 303.38] For the love of Jesus Christ,
[303.38 → 307.76] who has resurrected me.
[307.76 → 316.22] Praise the Father,
[316.22 → 319.22] praise the Son,
[319.22 → 323.32] praise the Spirit,
[323.32 → 326.82] three in one.
[326.82 → 333.00] God of glory, majesty,
[333.00 → 334.78] praise the Son,
[334.78 → 340.90] praise forever to the King of kings.
[340.90 → 348.34] Praise forever to the King of kings.
[363.00 → 381.42] and the King of kings.
[381.42 → 385.04] And the King of kings is operated,
[385.04 → 387.06] to the Holy,
[387.06 → 390.52] and the ace member of kings is
[390.52 → 390.70] cam Ward ah,
[390.70 → 391.52] many roots
[391.52 → 392.64] with reminder of the King of kings.
[392.64 → 395.88] above all things.
[395.88 → 404.98] Act justly, love mercy, walk humbly with you, God.
[405.54 → 414.34] In all things, in all ways, walk humbly with you, God.
[415.10 → 422.62] It all comes down to this, to be your hands and feet.
[422.64 → 427.84] Good news to all the world.
[428.62 → 432.90] Oh, the truth will set us free.
[433.86 → 442.22] Act justly, love mercy, walk humbly with you, God.
[442.90 → 451.64] In all things, in all ways, walk humbly with you, God.
[451.64 → 456.84] It's beauty for ashes, it's mourning and dancing.
[457.22 → 461.52] It's closer and closer, the kingdom of heaven.
[461.96 → 466.10] Beauty for ashes, it's mourning and dancing.
[466.54 → 470.84] It's closer and closer, the kingdom of heaven.
[470.84 → 484.04] And years from now, we'll see.
[484.04 → 488.30] The fruit our hands are sown.
[489.86 → 492.78] Faith just like a seed.
[492.78 → 499.20] The only way it grows.
[499.20 → 499.22] The only way it grows.
[499.22 → 517.22] Ecstasy, love mercy, walk humbly with you, God.
[517.22 → 526.64] In all things, in all ways, walk humbly with you, God.
[526.64 → 527.64] Amen.
[556.64 → 558.64] Amen.
[586.64 → 588.64] Amen.
[616.64 → 626.42] Stay away.
[626.42 → 628.88] How about now?
[628.88 → 630.88] How about...
[630.88 → 649.52] It's all right.
[649.52 → 651.72] It shouldn't be.
[651.94 → 652.66] Oh, there we go.
[653.56 → 653.96] Yay.
[657.56 → 658.56] Way to go, Courtney.
[658.84 → 659.22] All right.
[660.88 → 661.88] I'm...
[661.88 → 664.02] Was gave me two thumbs up, so that must mean it's working.
[665.24 → 665.72] Okay.
[666.02 → 666.78] Good morning.
[668.42 → 670.46] Welcome to the entertainment.
[671.66 → 672.72] My name is Chris.
[672.84 → 679.46] If you're a visitor here, I'm one of the pastors, and as we gather for worship, we come as those
[679.46 → 682.00] who need God and who rely on Him.
[682.08 → 687.50] We come to sing His praises and to hear from Him, and so I just want to thank you for joining
[687.50 → 690.30] us this Sunday for worship.
[690.88 → 696.40] As we gather together, we are welcomed by God, and we do so in community.
[696.86 → 701.02] And so I'm going to invite you to stand, that we can receive God's greeting.
[701.66 → 705.60] And then following God's greeting, I'm going to just encourage you to turn to those around
[705.60 → 708.56] you and welcome them into worship as well.
[708.56 → 711.78] And so, receive the greeting of our good God.
[713.28 → 720.00] Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, His Son,
[720.26 → 724.24] and our Saviour, through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[724.24 → 725.72] Amen.
[725.72 → 725.76] Amen.
[725.96 → 726.08] Amen.
[726.08 → 728.50] I'me, focused on this Saddam, the glory, and what we may call you and worship and to the Lord Jesus Christ,
[728.50 → 736.68] and to be here group in the Lord Jesus Christ, and to be here group in the Lord Jesus Christ,
[736.68 → 750.58] and to be here group in the Lord Jesus Christ, Nauru, and to be here.
[750.58 → 765.52] Our call to worship this morning is coming from Ephesians 1,
[765.98 → 767.18] where it says,
[767.40 → 771.22] Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[771.54 → 774.02] who has blessed us in the heavenly realms
[774.02 → 776.98] with every spiritual blessing in Christ.
[776.98 → 781.18] For he chose us in him before the creation of the world
[781.18 → 784.26] to be holy and blameless in his sight.
[785.02 → 791.02] In love he predestined us for adoption to son ship through Jesus Christ
[791.02 → 794.40] in accordance with his pleasure and will.
[795.28 → 798.90] Let's raise our voices and worship our heavenly Father this morning
[798.90 → 802.42] who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in Christ.
[806.98 → 826.90] Come all you weary, come all you thirsty,
[826.90 → 831.74] Come to the well that never comes to life,
[831.96 → 837.76] Drink of the water, come and thirst no more.
[841.04 → 845.70] Come all you sinners, come all you thirsty,
[846.20 → 850.38] Come to the stable he wills at his throne,
[850.38 → 856.62] Taste all his goodness, find what your earth will be for.
[856.62 → 886.60] Come and worship,
[886.60 → 893.88] is
[910.04 → 911.88] pong
[916.60 → 931.56] For all came, forever defeated, now it is found, a walking in freedom for God so loved, God so loved the world.
[931.56 → 951.56] Praise God, praise God, from whom all blessings flow, praise Him, praise Him, for the wonders of His love.
[951.56 → 970.56] Praise God, praise God, round through all blessings flow, praise Him, praise Him, for the wonders of His love.
[970.56 → 1000.54] For all came, forever defeated, now it is found, a walking in freedom for God so loved, God so loved, the world that He gave us is one and only time to save us.
[1000.54 → 1017.54] For all came, forever defeated, now it is found, a walking in freedom for God so loved, God so loved, the world.
[1017.54 → 1035.54] Bring all your failures, bring your attentions, come lay them down at the foot of the cross, Jesus is waiting, God so loved, the world.
[1035.54 → 1037.54] Amen.
[1037.54 → 1039.54] Amen.
[1067.54 → 1069.54] Amen.
[1097.54 → 1099.54] Amen.
[1127.54 → 1129.54] Amen.
[1157.54 → 1159.54] Amen.
[1187.54 → 1189.54] Amen.
[1217.54 → 1218.84] You may be seated.
[1223.84 → 1226.18] Acts 3, verse 19 says,
[1226.90 → 1231.60] Repent then and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out,
[1232.38 → 1235.02] that times of refreshing may come from the Lord.
[1236.30 → 1239.16] For me, the summer has always been a time of refreshing,
[1239.84 → 1244.20] but more a refreshment from, like, daily routines
[1244.20 → 1248.00] and a time to kind of refocus and re-energize.
[1248.62 → 1252.58] But I rarely think of it as a time of spiritual refreshing.
[1252.80 → 1253.12] I don't know.
[1253.40 → 1258.26] Life has been busy, and so you kind of relax from your daily routine,
[1258.40 → 1260.18] but I don't see it so much that way.
[1261.40 → 1264.60] But I was wondering if we could do, as Acts was saying,
[1264.84 → 1267.94] repent and turn to God so that our sins may be wiped out,
[1268.28 → 1270.38] that times of refreshing may come from the Lord.
[1270.38 → 1275.36] I think then we can enjoy everything Christ has accomplished for us,
[1275.46 → 1277.98] and we can rest in the victory that he's won.
[1279.30 → 1281.62] Now, Doreen and I have been reading a book called
[1281.62 → 1283.76] Seeking God's Face for Our Devotions,
[1284.18 → 1288.06] and I found a prayer that kind of I've been reflecting on,
[1288.12 → 1289.88] kind of chewing on the last sort of month,
[1290.54 → 1295.98] and I would like to use that as a prayer of rededication kind of
[1295.98 → 1297.14] and confession.
[1299.08 → 1300.16] Let's bow in prayer.
[1300.38 → 1302.48] Lord of the Sabbath,
[1303.42 → 1308.02] we can faithfully observe a day of rest and yet miss its point.
[1308.96 → 1310.98] Your rest is the goal of life.
[1311.22 → 1313.68] It's what you intended for all creation,
[1313.92 → 1316.80] to know you and to enjoy all your goodness.
[1317.64 → 1320.46] Thank you for the gospel invitation to catch our breath,
[1321.06 → 1323.06] to stop all our striving,
[1323.06 → 1326.40] and to enjoy everything accomplished for us in Jesus.
[1326.92 → 1328.14] In his name we pray.
[1328.50 → 1328.78] Amen.
[1330.38 → 1333.48] Let's rise together and sing of God's goodness.
[1333.48 → 1335.42] Imp Spielımız
[1335.42 → 1365.40] piano plays softly
[1365.42 → 1370.04] Oh, your mercy never fails me
[1370.04 → 1376.12] All my days I've been held in your hands
[1376.12 → 1380.24] From the moment that I wake up
[1380.24 → 1383.60] Till I lay my head
[1383.60 → 1389.46] I will sing of the goodness of God
[1389.46 → 1396.16] All my life you have been faithful
[1396.16 → 1403.46] All my life you have been so solid
[1403.46 → 1409.38] With every breath that I have made for
[1409.38 → 1416.08] I will sing of the goodness of God
[1416.08 → 1419.34] You're born
[1419.34 → 1424.84] You have led me through my road
[1424.84 → 1427.10] And I miss you
[1427.10 → 1430.46] You are close like no other
[1430.46 → 1433.94] I know you as a father
[1433.94 → 1438.10] I know you as a friend
[1438.10 → 1443.84] And I will sing of the goodness of God
[1443.84 → 1450.54] And all my life you have been faithful
[1450.54 → 1458.84] And all my life you have been so, so good
[1458.84 → 1463.34] With every breath that I have made for
[1463.34 → 1469.96] I will sing of the goodness of God
[1469.96 → 1475.08] Your goodness is running out
[1475.08 → 1477.96] It's running out with me
[1477.96 → 1481.56] Your goodness is running out
[1481.56 → 1484.46] It's running out with me
[1484.46 → 1486.60] With my life laid down
[1486.60 → 1488.28] I'll surrender now
[1488.28 → 1491.16] I'll kill you every day
[1491.16 → 1494.58] Your goodness is running out
[1494.58 → 1497.28] It's running out to me
[1497.28 → 1501.20] Your goodness is running out
[1501.20 → 1503.88] It's running out to me
[1503.88 → 1505.70] Your goodness is running out
[1505.70 → 1507.62] Your goodness is running out
[1507.62 → 1510.28] It's running out to me
[1510.28 → 1512.52] My life laid down
[1512.52 → 1514.18] I'll surrender now
[1514.18 → 1516.14] I'll give you everything
[1516.14 → 1520.44] Your goodness is running out
[1520.44 → 1523.54] It's running out to me
[1523.54 → 1533.64] You have been faithful
[1533.64 → 1542.14] All my life you have been so, so good
[1542.14 → 1546.16] And every breath that I am able
[1546.16 → 1552.64] I will sing of the goodness of God
[1552.64 → 1559.08] I will sing of the goodness of God
[1559.08 → 1559.66] I will sing of the goodness of God
[1559.66 → 1566.10] I will sing of the goodness of God

[1630.36 → 1631.36] We live with you

[1656.08 → 1658.08] And lead me

[1855.46 → 1856.38] Clem will be up shortly.
[1856.38 → 1862.38] First, I just want to acknowledge that I'm here representing the Refugee Sponsorship Committee.
[1863.16 → 1867.44] But we've got some very special guests with us this morning.
[1868.18 → 1876.44] And so Sebastian and Sandy, why don't you stand up with Sarah and your little daughter there, Julieta?
[1877.12 → 1878.00] Can you stand?
[1878.24 → 1878.76] All right.
[1879.88 → 1883.10] So they, yes, it's good to see you here.
[1883.10 → 1886.98] All right.
[1887.02 → 1889.10] I'm just going to read the letter that you gave to Pearl.
[1889.28 → 1889.70] All right.
[1889.74 → 1890.80] So you may sit down.
[1891.10 → 1897.08] So 16 months ago today, we arrived to the doors of the church looking for help for our family.
[1897.08 → 1901.44] Very kindly, Pastor Chris and Kevin were willing to take us in.
[1901.98 → 1908.84] And even though the language barrier was hard, they listened to us attentively, trying to find a solution.
[1909.38 → 1911.30] And after many phone calls, they formed us.
[1911.38 → 1913.68] There was a family willing to offer a space in their home.
[1913.70 → 1915.30] And that was John and Pearl DeShawn.
[1915.30 → 1921.74] Anyway, the following weekend, we went to church and everyone there welcomed us with a smile.
[1921.92 → 1926.58] Others with a hug, wishing that everything would be just fine for our family.
[1927.36 → 1931.08] The long language was not an impediment to feeling blessed.
[1932.40 → 1936.08] There are other acknowledgements in this thing, so I'll just kind of shorten it a bit.
[1936.08 → 1941.34] There are many of you we would like to thank, but we do not remember your name.
[1941.46 → 1943.58] Even so, you will always be in our hearts.
[1943.96 → 1946.48] Thanks for being so unconditional with our family.
[1947.26 → 1951.30] Today, we'd love to share with you a very exciting and joyful news.
[1951.84 → 1955.18] On January 31, we went to court, and we were accepted.
[1955.84 → 1960.18] So they came here not as refugees but as asylum seekers.
[1960.18 → 1966.74] Anyway, we are currently in the process of permanent residence, so this is a very important step they've made.
[1967.12 → 1969.62] And we feel blessed for being able to make it.
[1969.94 → 1975.74] We indeed have a merciful God and truly appreciate each one of you for your prayers.
[1976.32 → 1982.08] Of course, especially to John and Pearl, who housed them, and for bringing us the opportunity of meeting them
[1982.08 → 1986.08] and gifting us their help and patience for this dream to become real.
[1986.08 → 1992.08] So this is a blessing to all of us as a church, you know, and we feel it, and we experience it.
[1992.24 → 1993.30] And we love you.
[1993.82 → 1997.18] Yeah, thank you very much for this beautiful, beautiful letter.
[1997.68 → 1998.88] It's a wonderful ministry.
[1999.44 → 2001.82] Let's give them another warm welcome.
[2006.82 → 2012.44] So we currently are in negotiations with World Renew at application for the Never family.
[2012.44 → 2016.14] This is a mother and father who are stuck in Lebanon from Syria.
[2016.44 → 2020.06] And they have two children, a girl 14, a boy 11.
[2020.82 → 2026.76] And we expect that within the year, probably closer to a year, they will be arriving.
[2027.62 → 2029.90] World Renew has a very high success rate.
[2030.06 → 2032.62] Their application has been accepted by Canada.
[2032.62 → 2039.62] And so it just needs some in-depth looking into and making sure they meet all the criteria.
[2039.84 → 2041.62] So it looks very, very good.
[2041.94 → 2043.90] So we're going to need money for that, of course.
[2044.10 → 2045.96] And that's why today's collection.
[2046.62 → 2049.60] So we have about 15,000 in the bank.
[2050.06 → 2051.98] We probably need close to 40.
[2052.54 → 2054.72] And so there's going to be a huge need.
[2054.78 → 2056.86] But this congregation has always met the need.
[2057.34 → 2061.22] God works in our hearts to give us when we're ready to give.
[2061.22 → 2063.48] So thank you.
[2067.86 → 2068.74] Thanks, Peter.
[2070.04 → 2070.96] Thank you, Peter.
[2072.72 → 2073.54] Good morning.
[2073.62 → 2074.44] My name is Clem.
[2075.30 → 2081.08] And next week's offering is for Advocate, also known as Hope for Women Pregnancy Services.
[2082.52 → 2087.60] And, yeah, they service so many women in the community, especially these days.
[2087.60 → 2090.12] And thank you for your continued giving.
[2090.12 → 2090.22] Thank you.
[2090.22 → 2090.28] Thank you.
[2090.28 → 2090.30] Thank you.

[3010.28 → 3017.40] struggling with their mental health these long-term challenges sometimes go unnoticed or hidden
[3019.08 → 3022.84] maybe even these chronic struggles are a barrier for attending church
[3024.92 → 3029.96] when poor mental health is impacting someone's life we know that those who are closest
[3029.96 → 3035.96] walking alongside them also need community and support, and they need your rest oh lord
[3039.00 → 3047.64] I pray for other hidden struggles that maybe few people or no one but the one hurting knows about
[3049.16 → 3054.60] not all struggles need to or can be shared publicly but all struggling need support

[3064.20 → 3071.48] others as an outflow of your love to sit with to cry with to walk through the hardship with someone

[3079.00 → 3088.04] even if we don't know their need in prayer lord you know the beautiful thing is you connect us all as
[3088.04 → 3098.28] brothers and sisters in Christ not bound to one building but bound by your love we're all sinners, and we all need you
[3098.28 → 3103.08] desperately so we gather here this morning to hear your word spoken to us

[3121.80 → 3135.80] receive your word in Jesus name we pray amen
[3135.80 → 3160.04] continue our series looking at different faith heroes in the bible and in our life and as Sarah said
[3160.04 → 3168.60] indeed we're going to look at the story of noah's story is recorded for us in the Book of Genesis
[3170.52 → 3174.84] which is the very first book of the bible and so if you're going to follow along I encourage you to do
[3174.84 → 3183.72] that and just um open it up to the first book Noah's story is found in chapters 6 through 9
[3183.72 → 3192.76] we're not going to read all of that although in a moment I will go through um and uh recap the story
[3192.76 → 3198.60] but we are going to read one small portion of it this is the beginning uh we're going to read from
[3198.60 → 3203.96] chapter 6 starting at verse 9, and then we'll read through the end of that chapter to verse 22.
[3205.16 → 3210.28] I encourage you to have a bible open in front of you we're going to refer back and flip through in a
[3210.28 → 3220.76] bunch of places um and so you can follow along there let's read together this is the account of
[3220.76 → 3230.60] Noah and his family Noah was a righteous man blameless among the people of his time and he walked faithfully
[3230.60 → 3240.12] with god Noah had three sons Shem ham and Japheth now the earth was corrupt in god's sight and was
[3240.12 → 3246.92] full of violence god saw how corrupt the earth had become for all the people on earth had corrupted
[3246.92 → 3254.84] their ways so god said to Noah I am going to put an end to all people for the earth is filled with
[3254.84 → 3262.36] violence because of them I am surely going to destroy them and the earth so make yourself an ark of cypress
[3262.36 → 3270.84] wood make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out this is how you are to build it the ark is
[3270.84 → 3279.80] to be 300 cubits long 50 cubits wide and 30 cubits high make a roof for it leaving below the roof an
[3279.80 → 3287.72] opening one cubit high all around put a door in the side of the ark and make lower middle and upper decks
[3287.72 → 3294.92] I'm going to bring the floodwaters on earth to destroy all life under the heavens every creature
[3294.92 → 3301.96] that has the breath of life in it everything on earth will perish but I will establish my covenant
[3301.96 → 3309.16] with you, and you will enter the ark you and your sons and your wife and your son's wives with you
[3310.28 → 3316.44] you are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures male and female to keep them alive with
[3316.44 → 3322.60] you two of every kind of bird of every kind of animal and of every kind of creature that moves along
[3322.60 → 3329.96] the ground will come to you to be kept alive you are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten
[3329.96 → 3342.04] and stored away as food for you and for them Noah did everything just as god commanded him this is the word of the lord
[3346.44 → 3358.60] this summer we are looking at faith heroes from the bible and then at people in our own lives and stories
[3358.60 → 3370.44] who show us similar things now this list of faith heroes from the bible comes from Hebrews 11 now in the
[3370.44 → 3380.84] book of Hebrews what the author is trying to do as he brings us to this list of faith heroes is to call us
[3381.72 → 3390.44] as hearers and listeners to persevere that is to persist in faith and life together with Jesus
[3392.12 → 3399.48] we began this series by looking at Hebrews 11 verse 1 that says faith is confidence in what we hope for
[3399.48 → 3408.76] and assurance about what we do not see so faith believes in the future god promised and then faith
[3409.40 → 3419.16] and faithful living moves you towards that future now what we know from the bible right, and we see this in
[3419.16 → 3428.60] so many different places are that that faith is both a gift freely given by grace and faith and
[3428.60 → 3433.56] faithful living is a responsibility that you grow, and you grow in
[3439.00 → 3448.84] and so having faith does not mean there will no longer be doubts or that you will have no questions
[3448.84 → 3459.40] having faith also doesn't mean that life will be easy or that life will be fair or that life
[3459.40 → 3472.92] will be good instead faith changes what you do when you have doubts faith changes where you go when you have
[3472.92 → 3483.40] questions faith informs who you will listen to when you need answers and then and importantly for us in this series
[3483.96 → 3495.88] faith is never something you are meant to have and to hold alone right faith is given in community and then by that faith
[3495.88 → 3506.28] you are given a community the preacher in Hebrews 11 says let us consider how we may spur
[3507.08 → 3509.48] one another toward love and good deeds
[3510.52 → 3516.92] I said Hebrews 11 this is Hebrews 10 Hebrews 10 let us consider how we may spur one another toward love
[3516.92 → 3524.20] and good deeds right our job is to encourage each other and to spur each other on in life and in faith
[3525.24 → 3532.92] and you can't do that if you're not here you can't do that if you're not together right you can't do that if
[3532.92 → 3540.52] you're not connected and connecting to each other and the teacher the preacher goes on, and he says let us not
[3540.52 → 3549.16] give up meeting together and then all the more as you see the day approaching that little line all the
[3549.16 → 3559.08] more as you see the day approaching is critical in my mind because you see we need more of this not less
[3561.08 → 3565.64] we need more of this connecting and being connected not less of it
[3565.64 → 3572.44] uh I have a conviction some of you have heard me talk about this before and share this before
[3573.32 → 3581.72] but as we in the west as we in Canada become more and more what's generally called post-Christian
[3583.00 → 3591.16] I believe it's going to be harder and harder for a traditional orthodox bible believing Christians
[3591.16 → 3600.20] uh to exist together the context we live in is going to be harder to have our faith in and so
[3600.20 → 3609.40] because of that it's going to become even more important to have thick and strong and deep communities of
[3609.40 → 3618.92] faith and so if your experience of faith or of church or of belief is trying to discern the most
[3618.92 → 3626.52] minimal connection than you can make right how little can I connect with how little can I do
[3627.24 → 3634.76] how minimally can I contribute to what's going on here I mean with sensitivity but also maybe a little
[3634.76 → 3641.24] bit of boldness you're thinking in the wrong direction right it's not about minimal standards
[3641.96 → 3647.88] we need more right we need more life and story and faith together with other Christians with other
[3647.88 → 3659.64] believers not less look this is critical for all of us but I think it is most critical for you young
[3659.64 → 3667.96] adults who are here right this is so important especially for those of you who are moving away in
[3667.96 → 3677.00] the fall maybe for the first time right having a faith connection and a faith community that you belong to
[3677.00 → 3681.56] that you take ownership of that you invest in and that you allow to invest in you
[3685.08 → 3691.64] that is the greatest predictor of your faith growth and your spiritual well-being over the next few years
[3691.64 → 3705.48] of your life and I know that some of you have already experienced a little bit of this challenge and some of you have experienced the critical role that this kind of faith community plays but
[3705.48 → 3715.96] all of us will experience it more especially as we move outside the sort of bubble that we were raised in
[3715.96 → 3720.68] especially as the bubbles that we have lived in get smaller and smaller and smaller
[3722.12 → 3733.48] let me give you an example of this it used to be the case in our society in our culture that if you wanted to be a leader in the community leader of any kind
[3733.48 → 3744.52] it was expected that you would be a person of active faith and in the west here that primarily means a Christian faith
[3745.32 → 3752.12] now you can see some of this legacy continuing in the United States in particular in the office of the president
[3752.92 → 3761.80] right until very recently and maybe even still if you wanted to be president you at least had to say that you believed in god
[3761.80 → 3769.56] and statistically you polled better if you said you believed in god and were a member of a protestant church
[3770.92 → 3773.32] now that hasn't been the case in Canada for a little while
[3774.76 → 3784.12] and now again especially if you are 20 something being Christian is sometimes considered to be a mark
[3784.12 → 3792.28] against you and so here that change right what used to be required for any sort of like social
[3792.28 → 3798.68] standing any place of prominence in our society is now by many to be considered a liability
[3800.76 → 3807.40] now I've had people tell me directly into my face that that my faith is the problem and the root of social
[3807.40 → 3816.60] intolerance in the world and in the not too distant past right if you confessed Christian faith right or
[3816.60 → 3824.52] even if you didn't confess Christian faith you sort of just accepted people who did but now if you say you
[3824.52 → 3832.12] are a Christian especially in the public sphere and if you say god forbid that you're a conservative Christian
[3832.12 → 3840.60] well that strains credulity for people in the world today and how could you believe that why would you
[3840.60 → 3852.60] give up on Sunday brunch and mimosas to go to church, and so we've come to this time and place that thinks most of
[3852.60 → 3863.40] what we do is absurd and when we live in this reality and increasingly so we need what the book of Hebrews
[3863.40 → 3871.24] calls a cloud of witnesses to hold us up and to spur us forward and to pull us toward the prize
[3872.36 → 3879.56] even when we fall down even when we struggle even when we face doubt and that exactly according to the
[3879.56 → 3883.64] the book of Hebrews is what the story of Noah does
[3886.60 → 3895.00] and so for us to see that let me quickly with you cover off the story if you have your bibles open
[3895.56 → 3903.56] in chapter 6 through 9 I'm just going to rush through so the context is that the inclination of
[3903.56 → 3911.48] every thought and every human heart was only evil all the time, and so we read in 6 verse 6 the lord
[3911.48 → 3918.52] regretted that he made human beings on the earth and his heart was deeply troubled, and so he promises
[3918.52 → 3924.20] he's going to send a flood and even in the midst of that promise he sees believing Noah righteous Noah
[3924.20 → 3931.00] and he calls out to him and says I'm going to do this but you and your family I will save I will
[3931.00 → 3935.64] establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark you and your sons and your wife and your
[3935.64 → 3944.04] son's wives with you, and then he tells him to take with him these animal pairs right two by two
[3945.08 → 3951.96] although if you look a little bit deeper in chapter 7 verse 2 it says take with you seven pairs of every
[3951.96 → 3960.44] kind of clean animal and its mate and one pair of every kind of unclean animal and then also seven pairs of
[3960.44 → 3966.44] every kind of bird male and female to keep their various kinds alive throughout the earth and then
[3966.44 → 3974.04] god says seven days from now I will send rain on the earth, and it will rain for 40 days and for 40 nights
[3975.32 → 3981.40] and so as the story goes in the 600th year of Noah's life so he's not a young man anymore
[3982.84 → 3989.00] on the 17th day of the second month on that day all the springs of great deep burst forth and the floodgates
[3989.00 → 3996.84] of the heavens were opened and rain fell on earth for 40 days and for 40 nights for 40 days the rains
[3996.84 → 4002.60] came down and the floods came up the rains came down and the floods came up they rose greatly on the earth
[4002.60 → 4010.52] and all the high mountains under the heavens were covered only Noah was left and those with him on the ark
[4010.52 → 4021.72] and the waters flooded the earth for 150 days and then in chapter 8 verse 1 we read god remembered
[4022.28 → 4031.00] Noah god remembered Noah and then at the end of 150 days the water goes down and on the 17th day of the
[4031.00 → 4037.24] seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat the top of the mountains became visible
[4037.24 → 4043.24] and then after 40 days Noah opened a window that he had made in the ark, and he sent out a raven and
[4043.24 → 4049.40] that raven kept flying back and forth and until the water had dried up from the earth, and then he sent
[4049.40 → 4055.88] out a dove to see if the water had receded but the dove could find nowhere to perch and because there was
[4055.88 → 4062.12] water still everywhere and so it returned he waited seven more days, and then he sent out the dove again
[4062.12 → 4068.20] from the ark and when the dove returned to him in the evening there in its beak was a freshly plucked
[4068.20 → 4075.64] olive leaf and so the waters had receded and the plants had started coming back and then god said to
[4075.64 → 4082.04] Noah verse 15 of chapter 8 is where I'm at come out of the ark you and your wife and your sons and their
[4082.04 → 4088.52] wives, and then he encourages them to go out and to reclaim the ground to move it, and then he says
[4088.52 → 4095.56] multiply on the earth and be fruitful and increase in number on it which for those of you with ears
[4095.56 → 4102.20] to hear is a callback to genesis 1 verse 28 where god tells Adam and eve to be fruitful and to multiply
[4102.20 → 4109.00] and to fill the earth and subdue it and so there's an act here of recreating and recommissioning
[4109.00 → 4115.96] god's people in the world and so Noah comes out, and he builds an altar taking some of the clean
[4115.96 → 4121.24] animals and clean birds he sacrifices burnt offerings on them the lord smells the pleasing
[4121.24 → 4126.36] aroma and in his heart he says never again will I curse the ground because of humans even though
[4126.36 → 4133.08] every inclination of the human heart is evil from childhood notice that inclination hasn't changed
[4136.12 → 4143.32] that inclination hasn't changed and on it goes the inclination of the heart is still evil
[4143.32 → 4151.08] but god has made a promise god has made a promise that he will never destroy all the living creatures
[4151.08 → 4156.76] again and then god says to Noah in chapter 9 verse 12 this is the sign of the covenant that I am making
[4156.76 → 4162.60] between me and you and every living creature with you a covenant for all generations to come I have set
[4162.60 → 4168.52] my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth whenever I bring
[4168.52 → 4173.48] clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds I will remember my covenant between me
[4173.48 → 4179.48] and you and all the living creatures of every kind whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds I will see it
[4179.48 → 4184.92] and remember the everlasting covenant between god and all living creatures and every kind on the earth
[4184.92 → 4195.40] and so god said to Noah this is the sign of the covenant I have established between me and all life on earth
[4198.20 → 4205.64] now this is an amazing story and people have written books on it people have preached entire
[4205.64 → 4212.60] sermon series on just these few chapters, and so I want to note three quick things that work for us as the
[4212.60 → 4219.24] foundation of the step we will take after that work for us as the foundation as to why Noah becomes a
[4219.24 → 4227.96] faith hero for us first I want you to see in chapter 6 verse 6 the grieving heart of god
[4228.68 → 4234.84] right we read the lord regretted that he'd made human beings on earth and his heart was deeply troubled
[4236.04 → 4241.72] now that phrase the lord regretted that word that's used and that word that's used for his heart was
[4241.72 → 4252.12] deeply troubled is a word that is sometimes translated grieved right the lord was grieved god's heart is
[4252.12 → 4260.28] grieved his heart is broken at sin in the world and here's the point that I want you to remember and to hear
[4260.28 → 4269.64] right because if you know the god of the bible you will know that he is what we call omniscient right that is
[4269.64 → 4276.68] he knows everything right when god created the world before god created the world he knew exactly
[4276.68 → 4284.04] what would happen right from the moment that god started thinking about creating he knew the potential
[4284.04 → 4292.12] that would be realized that humanity would sin and fall away from him so think about that okay Adam and
[4292.12 → 4300.20] eve's sin in the garden does not catch god off guard the fact that every inclination of every human heart
[4300.76 → 4304.92] right does not surprise is evil does not surprise god
[4308.04 → 4314.12] right that the's not caught off guard by this and so
[4314.12 → 4325.16] he's also not disappointed by it now hear what I'm saying and listen carefully right god is not
[4325.16 → 4333.64] disappointed by our sin because he knew that it would happen right disappointment is the result of
[4333.64 → 4340.92] something negative that you don't know could happen or disappointment comes when you have an
[4340.92 → 4351.16] expectation for something else and that expectation isn't met god doesn't have an expectation of his
[4351.16 → 4359.48] creation that isn't met because he knows everything and so here this pastoral heart right god doesn't have
[4359.48 → 4365.64] that expectation of you god is not disappointed in you, and he's not surprised if you sin
[4365.64 → 4374.68] do you remember when you were a kid, and you did something wrong and your mom looked at you and said
[4375.32 → 4378.44] I'm not angry I'm just disappointed
[4380.60 → 4383.24] that didn't happen for you guys you're all better than I was
[4387.80 → 4395.08] mom not being angry but disappointed cut deeper right because like I wish you would be angry
[4395.64 → 4401.32] at least that I can deal with I know how to deal with that disappointment is something else but can
[4401.32 → 4409.40] I just say god's not like your mom right god isn't disappointed because he knew exactly what would happen
[4410.76 → 4417.48] and so instead of disappointment right god's heart is grieved right his heart is broken because he longs
[4417.48 → 4424.44] for you to be close to him and for you to experience his closeness that's why he enters into the world
[4424.44 → 4430.12] because his heart is grieved it's out of his grieving heart that he comes, and he provides salvation
[4432.12 → 4439.56] and so can I just say if you are carrying around shame or guilt for disappointing god
[4441.08 → 4449.88] you've got the wrong idea of god's not your mom right god's heart is grieved, and so he comes into
[4449.88 → 4456.28] the world to save sinners that means you and that means me, and he knows you intimately and more deeply
[4456.28 → 4462.84] than you know yourself there is nothing that is hidden from the sight of god and still he comes to you
[4462.84 → 4473.08] and he calls you his own that's the heart of god for his people so hear the call of god
[4473.08 → 4481.96] god's grieving heart is the motivation for his action in the world and that comes then to the
[4481.96 → 4488.76] second point to make quickly about this story the very centre of this story this whole story is structured
[4488.76 → 4499.72] both um literarily in form but also uh thematically around 8 verse 1 but god remembered Noah
[4499.72 → 4507.40] now this little line is so important that Walter brueggemann who's a biblical scholar he calls this line
[4507.40 → 4516.68] the heart of the gospel according to Noah right the gospel is that god remembers his people and because
[4516.68 → 4524.44] god remembers his people he acts in power for their salvation this is who god is he's omniscient yes he's
[4524.44 → 4532.12] omnipotent yes, but he is so committed to his creation and to his chosen people that he remembers them
[4532.68 → 4542.12] even when the entire world forgets him that's the heart of who god is and how he has revealed himself
[4542.12 → 4549.40] in this story and lastly then the final point to make the importance of the rainbow sign and god's covenant
[4549.40 → 4555.96] faithfulness right we read that whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds I will see it and
[4555.96 → 4561.72] remember the everlasting covenant between god and all the living creatures of every kind on the earth
[4561.72 → 4569.96] this is the sign of the covenant I have established between me and all life on the earth to this day
[4569.96 → 4582.12] the rainbow is a symbol of god remembering his covenant promise covenant is a word that we use to talk
[4582.12 → 4592.44] about a special relationship established and that defines reality for the two parties and the rainbow is a
[4592.44 → 4603.40] picture of god saying I remember you the rainbow is a picture of god saying never again will I destroy
[4603.40 → 4613.32] the world never again will we be separated and so you've got god's grieving heart you've got the gospel of
[4613.32 → 4623.80] his remembering, and then you have god's promise to remember, and it's out of all of this all of who god is
[4624.44 → 4632.12] that Noah then in this story becomes an example for us and that's the foundation that I want you to hear
[4632.12 → 4641.88] this important distinction Noah is who he is to us because of who god is to Noah right you get what I'm
[4641.88 → 4650.52] saying there Noah is held up as an example for us because of who god was to Noah in his life because
[4650.52 → 4658.28] what god did in his life precisely because god remembered Noah he is held up for us as an example
[4658.28 → 4666.84] of faith he is a faith hero because of who god is to him and that's the point then that Hebrews 11
[4666.84 → 4679.48] verse 7 verse 7 makes about Noah Hebrews 11 verse 7 says by faith Noah when warned about things not yet seen
[4679.48 → 4687.56] in holy fear built an ark to save his family and by his faith he condemned the world and became heir of the
[4687.56 → 4696.60] righteousness that is in keeping with faith and so there are two things then as we pull all of this
[4696.60 → 4704.84] together that I want us to see about the faith of Noah that makes him a hero an example for us first
[4705.56 → 4713.24] Noah takes god's word seriously he believes what god says about the future and about his salvation
[4713.24 → 4720.60] and then he acts accordingly and then second his obedience and his preaching stood opposed to the
[4720.60 → 4730.60] world around him, and yet he persisted in his faith and faithfulness and so first Noah takes god's word
[4731.16 → 4741.72] seriously Noah hears god's word about the coming disaster, and he believes him, and so he acts
[4741.72 → 4748.92] accordingly, and he lives with a responsible response to the future he sees in front of him
[4750.92 → 4759.72] this is the pattern for us too right god has given us as Christians in his word a clear revelation
[4759.72 → 4770.44] and indication of the future, and it's a future that is fixed and sure because god remembers us and god
[4770.44 → 4778.68] continues to remember his people, and so he sent his son into the world to live a life of perfect
[4778.68 → 4785.96] obedience on our behalf god remembers us, and so he sent his son into the world to die the death on the
[4785.96 → 4794.20] cross that you and I deserve god remembers us and so Jesus came and by his life and death you and I might
[4794.20 → 4805.32] be spared Jesus right is the ark of our salvation and what's more we know and can know that this same Jesus
[4805.32 → 4815.72] will return and that at his return all things will be made new the recreation of the flood will be fully
[4815.72 → 4823.32] realized in the greater and grander recreation of all that is right one day there will be no more death or
[4823.32 → 4828.68] mourning or crying or pain for the old order of things has passed away right he who is seated on the
[4828.68 → 4837.88] throne has said I am making everything new no longer will there be any curse the throne of god and of the
[4837.88 → 4845.56] lamb will be in the city and his servants will be with them, they will see his face and his name will be on
[4845.56 → 4855.48] their foreheads this is the future that we are now called to live out and live in light of to live out of
[4855.48 → 4865.00] response to this future is sure, and it is fixed, and it will happen because god remembers his people
[4866.04 → 4874.44] and so to have a faith like Noah is to live in light of a future fully realized kingdom of god and to live
[4874.44 → 4884.12] in light of that right now right here right the future reality is working its way backwards through time
[4884.12 → 4892.76] and history to the present giving you hope and assurance giving you certainty at this moment even when
[4892.76 → 4898.12] everything looks like chaos this truth remains
[4898.12 → 4900.20] confidence
[4900.76 → 4907.16] now faith is confidence in what we hope for this is that confidence
[4909.48 → 4910.28] and so we live
[4912.36 → 4917.80] in the hope and in the truth of that sure future
[4919.56 → 4923.00] second Noah's faith is commended
[4923.00 → 4924.52] is commended
[4924.52 → 4925.64] is commended to us
[4926.28 → 4929.64] because he stood firm in his obedience
[4930.20 → 4933.96] even when the whole world thought he was crazy
[4934.92 → 4936.36] right Hebrews
[4936.36 → 4937.00] seven
[4937.00 → 4938.52] or 11 7
[4938.52 → 4944.92] says in that second part by faith Noah condemned the world and became an heir of righteousness that is in keeping
[4945.40 → 4946.52] with faith
[4946.52 → 4947.72] faith
[4947.72 → 4954.84] in second peter 2 verse 5 you can read peter calls Noah a preacher of righteousness
[4956.68 → 4965.16] now early Jews and Christians would retell the story of Noah and the story of the flood in a way and
[4965.16 → 4972.84] they would flesh it out with Noah preaching against the people around him even as he was building the ark
[4973.56 → 4978.52] and he would warn them of the coming disaster in their telling of the story you can read it in the
[4978.52 → 4981.40] sibylline oracles a document an ancient document from that time
[4981.96 → 4983.00] and he would plead with them
[4983.56 → 4988.12] right you hear Noah's pastoral heart come out in the story that they tell of him as they
[4989.16 → 4990.12] as they flesh it out
[4991.96 → 4992.44] and yet
[4994.20 → 4995.96] the world ridiculed him
[4997.24 → 4997.96] laughed at him
[4998.76 → 5000.36] and rejected him
[5000.36 → 5003.00] and that's the thing right that's the
[5004.12 → 5004.76] comparison
[5005.40 → 5008.68] in a world that is so opposed to the truth of god
[5010.04 → 5015.88] so opposed to preaching god's truth and so opposed to living in obedience to him
[5017.00 → 5023.80] in that world obedience to god is going to seem counterintuitive it's going to seem absurd to those
[5023.80 → 5030.04] people who don't get it right this has always been the case right radical obedience in an age of rampant
[5030.04 → 5040.76] disobedience is convicting to and of the world disciplined discipleship in an age of anything goes is shocking
[5040.76 → 5043.40] to those who see it
[5043.40 → 5045.72] and
[5045.72 → 5048.52] we live this way
[5048.52 → 5050.28] as Noah did
[5050.28 → 5056.20] when someone sees that and their conscience is pricked like that
[5056.20 → 5066.28] that often the default response is to charge us or to charge that person right to be charged with being judgmental and being hypocritical
[5066.28 → 5067.64] right
[5067.64 → 5072.12] and that's meant to just dismiss everything we say and do and let's be honest right like
[5073.00 → 5075.16] when someone calls me hypocritical they're not wrong
[5077.64 → 5086.28] I'm a hypocrite we are all hypocrites we all fall short of this standard and this call to radical obedience over and over and over again
[5086.28 → 5088.20] and yet
[5090.44 → 5092.76] if my commitment to radical obedience
[5095.16 → 5097.40] right if is you decide to
[5098.28 → 5099.64] discipline
[5099.64 → 5105.16] and if you decide to live in a disciplined discipleship kind of way what you do
[5106.12 → 5108.68] that will offend the people around you
[5110.12 → 5113.00] right and not because you're being offensive
[5113.00 → 5117.16] but because they are wondering
[5118.12 → 5119.32] if they should be doing it too
[5121.16 → 5122.44] if that's how they should be living
[5123.48 → 5123.96] as well
[5128.84 → 5129.24] when i
[5130.68 → 5131.64] was in university
[5132.44 → 5133.72] I lived with
[5135.88 → 5138.68] a guy who became a perfect friend of mine the last two years
[5138.68 → 5141.48] we lived off campus we shared a house together his name is Craig
[5143.96 → 5147.48] Craig a young man from rural
[5148.68 → 5149.40] Manitoba
[5150.28 → 5150.60] and
[5151.64 → 5157.32] I was still at this point in my life relatively new to taking my faith seriously
[5158.12 → 5162.36] and so I wasn't really sure or confident in what that looked like
[5163.64 → 5166.20] Craig is an example of someone who
[5166.20 → 5167.24] who was
[5168.84 → 5171.96] someone who modelled for me what it looked like to be
[5173.16 → 5178.36] faithfully obedient in response to the call of the call of god regardless
[5178.36 → 5183.08] of what the people around him or what the world around him thought he should be like
[5185.24 → 5189.32] Craig and I would stay up until early in the morning discussing issues of life
[5189.32 → 5194.68] and faith, and then he would get up, and then he would go volunteer at the rock which is a
[5194.68 → 5200.52] a youth homeless centre in downtown Hamilton, and then he would talk one-on-one with these
[5201.40 → 5206.28] young people who came to the centre, and he would share his story of faith and his commitment
[5206.28 → 5210.36] to the gospel and his commitment to living faithfully in response to god's word
[5210.36 → 5214.04] and every time I talked to Craig
[5215.40 → 5216.12] my heart
[5216.12 → 5219.32] would simultaneously sing
[5220.12 → 5223.32] because I wanted something like that and I wanted to be like that
[5223.32 → 5229.96] and I was also convicted because I wasn't yet and I was growing
[5231.00 → 5237.48] and so when I think of Craig he is to me a modern example of Noah
[5237.48 → 5244.92] who regardless of what the world around him said lived his life in faithful response and called me
[5245.48 → 5248.36] to the same and inspires me to the same
[5257.32 → 5260.20] two years after I first started living with Craig
[5260.20 → 5267.72] the summer after we graduated from redeemer he was driving in his hometown of Brandon Manitoba
[5268.76 → 5271.72] and he was killed in a car crash
[5274.36 → 5276.68] the car coming towards him had crossed the centre line
[5277.48 → 5285.32] and hit him head-on doing 120 odd kilometres he and his cousin who was a passenger in the car
[5286.20 → 5287.96] were both killed instantly
[5287.96 → 5298.36] and so the group of us friends from redeemer about 30 of us got on a plane went to Brandon Manitoba
[5298.36 → 5302.76] spent the weekend with his family and participated in the funeral
[5305.40 → 5315.08] Craig's funeral text was Ecclesiastes 12 verse 1 which says remember your creator in the days of your youth
[5317.96 → 5322.44] the day that was compelling to me
[5322.44 → 5329.00] but Craig would also tell you he would be the first to tell you
[5330.60 → 5332.36] that his remembering of god
[5332.92 → 5337.00] wasn't as important as god remembering him
[5340.04 → 5344.28] and at Craig's funeral my friends asked me to stand and speak on our behalf
[5344.28 → 5356.12] and I told this story of Craig he was a man even in his young cut way too short life
[5358.76 → 5368.84] showed me what it was like to be Noah as a Christian standing firm on the truth of god's word firm in the
[5368.84 → 5375.40] hope of the future to come and willing come what may not matter what people say
[5376.52 → 5379.88] to speak the truth of god
[5381.32 → 5387.24] Noah is a faith hero because he calls us to radical obedience and bold proclamation
[5387.24 → 5393.72] Craig is a faith hero to me because he calls me and inspires me to radical obedience and to bold
[5393.72 → 5395.08] the truth of god's word for the truth of god
[5395.08 → 5405.40] who in your life has done the same and how can you thank them and equally how will you be that
[5405.40 → 5413.16] kind of person for someone else maybe someone here maybe someone in your home or family but how will you
[5413.16 → 5421.48] be the kind of person because god remembers you that you too will go out and remember your creator
[5422.12 → 5430.12] in the days of your youth or in the days of your middle-aged life or in the days of your third
[5430.12 → 5438.44] remember your creator because he remembers you let's pray together
[5443.32 → 5453.40] holy god you call us forward in faith and in perseverance help us to know today
[5453.40 → 5463.88] that even as we are persevering forward you are preserving us from within and that by this gift of
[5463.88 → 5472.68] faith that you have freely given by grace we are now called to grow that gift and to grow in our faith
[5473.64 → 5480.92] and so allow us to be bold proclaimers of your gospel in a world that finds the truth of god
[5480.92 → 5488.92] offensive allow us to live lives of radical obedience even when people around us find it absurd and then
[5488.92 → 5495.48] lord god help us to see that there are people around us there are a great cloud of witnesses that we
[5495.48 → 5505.88] hear together brothers and sisters in the faith are here to spur each of us forward to spur us on
[5505.88 → 5516.44] use these stories this gospel truth from Noah down through Jesus Christ into the modern day life we live
[5516.44 → 5533.88] as disciples use this truth to call us out in Jesus name we pray amen
[5535.88 → 5547.64] amen
[5558.76 → 5563.88] hey
[5563.88 → 5578.20] I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,
[5578.20 → 5584.72] I bow through the mount, the universe displays.
[5586.00 → 5591.40] Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to me,
[5591.40 → 5598.40] How great Thou art, how great Thou art,
[5599.56 → 5605.40] Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to me,
[5605.40 → 5612.40] How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
[5612.40 → 5622.40] When through the woods and forest glades I wander,
[5622.40 → 5629.40] I hear the birds sing singly in the trees.
[5629.40 → 5636.64] When I look down from lofty mountain grand earth,
[5636.64 → 5642.40] And hear the birds sing singly in the trees.
[5642.40 → 5649.40] Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to me,
[5649.40 → 5656.40] How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
[5656.40 → 5663.40] Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to me,
[5663.40 → 5670.40] How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
[5670.40 → 5675.40] How great Thou art, how great Thou art, how great Thou art.
[5675.40 → 5679.80] That God his Son not sparing
[5679.80 → 5683.26] Sent him to die
[5683.26 → 5687.08] I scarce can take it in
[5687.08 → 5690.24] That on the cross
[5690.24 → 5693.80] My burden gladly bearing
[5693.80 → 5697.26] He bled and died
[5697.26 → 5701.08] To take away my sin
[5701.08 → 5704.34] Then sings my soul
[5704.34 → 5707.98] I sang it now to thee
[5707.98 → 5711.56] How great thou art
[5711.56 → 5714.84] How great thou art
[5714.84 → 5717.74] Then sings my soul
[5717.74 → 5721.14] I sang it now to thee
[5721.14 → 5724.90] How great thou art
[5724.90 → 5728.38] How great thou art
[5731.08 → 5734.34] I shall come
[5734.34 → 5737.68] With shout of acclamation
[5737.68 → 5741.08] And take me home
[5741.08 → 5744.92] What joy shall fill my heart
[5744.92 → 5747.34] Then I shall bow
[5747.34 → 5751.18] In humble adoration
[5751.18 → 5754.34] And there proclaim
[5754.34 → 5758.44] My God will bring thou home
[5758.44 → 5761.70] And sing my soul
[5761.70 → 5765.28] My Saviour come to thee
[5765.28 → 5768.70] How great thou art
[5768.70 → 5771.92] How great thou art
[5771.92 → 5774.70] Then sings my soul
[5774.70 → 5777.70] My Saviour come to thee
[5777.70 → 5781.92] How great thou art
[5781.92 → 5784.44] How great thou art

[5807.26 → 5811.72] And I encourage you to use that time of connecting and conversation
[5811.72 → 5814.98] To share life and faith together

[5818.18 → 5822.92] Or where you are crying out to see God at work in your life

[5829.70 → 5830.50] But it will be yellow
[5830.50 → 5833.12] They would love to meet you and pray with you

[5836.16 → 5841.82] God go before you to lead you
[5841.82 → 5844.78] God go behind you to protect you
[5844.78 → 5847.46] God go beneath you to support you
[5847.46 → 5850.28] And God go beside you to befriend you
[5850.28 → 5852.30] Do not be afraid
[5852.30 → 5854.76] Let the blessing of God come upon you today
[5854.76 → 5856.26] Do not be afraid
[5856.26 → 5858.86] But go in peace
[5858.86 → 5861.76] To love and serve the Lord
[5861.76 → 5863.46] Amen
[5863.46 → 5884.40] You're the Lion of Judah
[5884.40 → 5886.62] The Lamb who once stood
[5886.62 → 5888.74] You were sent into heaven
[5888.74 → 5890.92] And evermore the rain
[5890.92 → 5893.04] At the end of the age
[5893.04 → 5895.08] When the earth will renew

[5898.72 → 5901.48] And the eyes of all men
[5901.48 → 5903.70] Will be fixed on the lam
[5903.70 → 5905.92] Who was crucified
[5905.92 → 5911.24] When wisdom and mercy and justice
[5911.24 → 5916.30] Will reign at the Father's eye

[5943.30 → 5945.42] And the Lord of all kings

[5955.74 → 5957.92] And the sword in our side
[5957.92 → 5960.14] There's a fire in our spirit
[5960.14 → 5962.08] That cannot be denied
[5962.08 → 5964.56] As the Father has told us
[5964.56 → 5966.42] For the easy round of night
[5966.42 → 5969.58] For the nations that gather the boys
