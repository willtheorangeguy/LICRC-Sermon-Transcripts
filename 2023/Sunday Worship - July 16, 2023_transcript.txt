[1136.86 --> 1142.72]  Every planet has been fashioned by your hand.
[1143.38 --> 1150.86]  Oh, creation holds together on the power of your voice.
[1151.86 --> 1155.20]  Let the skies declare your glory.
[1155.86 --> 1158.86]  Let the land and seas rejoice.
[1158.86 --> 1163.32]  You are the owner of creation.
[1164.00 --> 1168.08]  You are the Lord of every land.
[1168.48 --> 1173.86]  Let the quiet and loving turn the cross for heaven.
[1176.50 --> 1179.86]  If you love the days of angels,
[1181.00 --> 1184.84]  need to seek and save the lost.
[1184.84 --> 1193.06]  Can you exchange the joy of heaven for the anguish of the cross?
[1193.56 --> 1196.92]  If the prayer you've heard of me,
[1197.56 --> 1200.84]  with the word you still receive,
[1201.70 --> 1204.84]  then I'll silently insist on,
[1205.54 --> 1208.84]  let the empty day go free.

[1216.46 --> 1218.32]  You are the Lord of every land.
[1218.56 --> 1222.98]  His Marvel düşe'n seine miej tweeting on the ground.
[1225.70 --> 1229.70]  I shout to Rose Victoria,

[1234.34 --> 1238.26]  And ascended into heaven
[1238.26 --> 1242.22]  Leading back in your way
[1242.22 --> 1245.96]  Now we stand before you ever
[1245.96 --> 1250.52]  And sing before you're home
[1250.52 --> 1254.30]  From each child and God and nation
[1254.30 --> 1258.72]  You are the existence of
[1258.72 --> 1262.18]  You're the author of creation
[1262.18 --> 1266.62]  You're the Lord of every man
[1266.62 --> 1269.40]  And your fire of love
[1269.40 --> 1272.46]  Return across the land
[1272.46 --> 1278.24]  You're the author of creation
[1278.24 --> 1282.18]  You're the Lord of every man
[1282.72 --> 1285.56]  And your fire of love
[1285.56 --> 1288.88]  Return across the land
[1292.18 --> 1299.22]  Our confession comes from 1 John 1
[1299.22 --> 1300.64]  It says,
[1300.82 --> 1303.92]  This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you
[1303.92 --> 1307.38]  God is light, in him there is no darkness at all
[1307.38 --> 1311.24]  If we claim to have fellowship with him and yet walk in the darkness
[1311.24 --> 1313.82]  We lie and do not live out the truth
[1313.82 --> 1317.20]  But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light
[1317.20 --> 1318.96]  We have fellowship with one another
[1318.96 --> 1321.26]  And the blood of Jesus, his son
[1321.26 --> 1323.26]  Purifies us from all our sin
[1323.26 --> 1325.66]  If we claim to be without sin
[1325.66 --> 1326.88]  We deceive ourselves
[1326.88 --> 1328.64]  And the truth is not in us
[1328.64 --> 1330.74]  If we confess our sins
[1330.74 --> 1332.74]  He is faithful and just
[1332.74 --> 1334.52]  And will forgive us our sins
[1334.52 --> 1337.22]  And purify us from all unrighteousness
[1337.22 --> 1339.30]  In humility and faith
[1339.30 --> 1341.44]  Let us confess our sin to God
[1341.44 --> 1343.00]  In a time of silent prayer
[1343.00 --> 1372.98]  In a time of silent prayer
[1373.00 --> 1391.58]  God, convict our hearts to reveal our deepest sins
[1391.58 --> 1394.02]  And the sins we think that are insignificant
[1394.02 --> 1396.06]  Confessing them to you
[1396.06 --> 1399.84]  And allowing your transforming power to work in our lives
[1399.84 --> 1403.62]  As we confess them over and over and over again in discipline
[1403.62 --> 1405.70]  As our walls break
[1405.70 --> 1407.94]  And we realize the gravity of our sin
[1407.94 --> 1410.64]  Come near and comfort us in our need
[1410.64 --> 1413.46]  May your word take shape in our lives
[1413.46 --> 1415.60]  And your spirit come alive in us
[1415.60 --> 1419.54]  As we live into and out of your unconditional love
[1419.54 --> 1430.12]  I hear thee every hour
[1430.12 --> 1435.34]  Most gracious Lord
[1435.34 --> 1441.20]  No tender voice like thine
[1441.20 --> 1445.34]  Can peace accord
[1445.34 --> 1451.08]  I need thee, O I need thee

[1504.10 --> 1511.04]  My Savior, I come to Thee.
[1513.60 --> 1518.44]  I need Thee every hour.

[1523.30 --> 1528.30]  Come with me and abide.
[1529.30 --> 1533.64]  For life is me.
[1534.10 --> 1539.86]  I need Thee, O I need Thee.
[1540.40 --> 1544.64]  Every hour I need Thee.
[1544.64 --> 1549.10]  For mercy, now my Savior.
[1549.10 --> 1554.64]  I come to Thee.
[1556.64 --> 1561.98]  I need Thee every hour.

[1572.52 --> 1575.98]  The blessed Son.
[1575.98 --> 1581.74]  I need Thee, O I need Thee.
[1581.74 --> 1585.44]  I need Thee every hour.
[1585.44 --> 1586.52]  I need Thee.
[1586.52 --> 1591.40]  For mercy, now my Savior.
[1591.40 --> 1595.66]  I come to Thee.
[1595.66 --> 1597.94]  I need Thee.

[1607.80 --> 1612.68]  and have confidence in who God is by professing the Apostles' Creed.
[1612.68 --> 1620.14]  I believe in God the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
[1620.14 --> 1630.28]  I believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary.
[1630.28 --> 1636.28]  He suffered under Pontius Pilate, who was crucified, died, and was buried.
[1636.28 --> 1638.28]  He descended to hell.
[1638.28 --> 1641.82]  The third day He rose again from the dead.
[1641.82 --> 1647.82]  He ascended to heaven and is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.
[1647.82 --> 1651.82]  From there He will come to judge the living and the dead.
[1651.82 --> 1665.82]  I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.
[1665.82 --> 1666.82]  Amen.
[1681.82 --> 1684.60]  Amen.

[1723.94 --> 1733.94]  When the nations are born, I will serve my God, all my days.
[1733.94 --> 1744.44]  When the nations are born, I will serve my God, all my days.
[1744.44 --> 1756.94]  When the nations are born, I will serve my God, all my days.
[1756.94 --> 1762.10]  I will not be you, I will not be changed.
[1776.60 --> 1783.10]  I will declare my joy, some nations, and I will shout for joy.
[1783.10 --> 1790.30]  In the congregation, I will let you fly, I will let you fly.
[1790.30 --> 1798.42]  All my days, those who don't come home, are satisfied.
[1798.42 --> 1802.36]  Those who trust in Him, are justified.
[1803.12 --> 1807.30]  I will serve my God, I will save my God.
[1807.82 --> 1810.76]  All my days.
[1813.10 --> 1817.72]  When the nations will grow,
[1817.72 --> 1820.30]  You will hear the voice.
[1820.30 --> 1826.36]  These may rise and fall,
[1826.36 --> 1834.30]  You will hear the song, they stop your voice.
[1834.30 --> 1836.84]  You will hear the voice.

[1850.52 --> 1855.36]  You will hear the voice.
[1855.36 --> 1855.98]  To my soul, I will not be shaken.
[1855.98 --> 1858.90]  To my soul, I will not beolinite,
[1858.90 --> 1861.90]  I will not be 그� phases.
[1861.90 --> 1863.14]  I will not be shaken.
[1863.14 --> 1864.12]  I will not be shaken.
[1864.12 --> 1864.92]  I will not be shaken.
[1864.92 --> 1866.30]  I will not be shaken.
[1866.30 --> 1867.00]  I will not be shaken.
[1867.00 --> 1867.38]  I will not be shaken.
[1867.38 --> 1868.30]  I will not be shaken.
[1868.30 --> 1869.20]  I will not be shaken.
[1869.20 --> 1870.24]  I will not be shaken.
[1871.38 --> 1872.06]  You will not be 정ative.
[1872.06 --> 1872.64]  I will not be shaken.
[1872.64 --> 1873.58]  I will not be shaken forever.
[1873.60 --> 1874.46]  I will not be taken.
[1874.76 --> 1876.10]  The law that emergesgreat faithfully doth with the áats.
[1876.10 --> 1876.56]  In the context of the time I eat with the雨 of the Spring hinaus.
[1876.56 --> 1877.24]  I will not be entertained.
[1877.24 --> 1879.06]  It's just a Absolute day for MELSw over.
[1879.06 --> 1879.56]  notes the young woman in the past.
[1879.56 --> 1894.08]  Good morning. We continue our worship with the giving of our gifts for the budget, which covers the administration and ministries of the church, and the special offering for today, which is the Langley Food Bank.
[1894.08 --> 1904.68]  As you can see from the many grocery bags in the front of the sanctuary, the Lord has blessed this second annual Emanuel Food Bank drive.
[1905.46 --> 1916.76]  And on behalf of the deacons, I want to thank everyone who volunteered, the members who distributed the empty bags into the neighborhoods here in Murrayville,
[1916.76 --> 1930.12]  and the neighbors who filled and returned the grocery bags, and then everyone who was involved in the pancake breakfast and the children's fair.
[1931.80 --> 1943.20]  And above all, I also want to thank Langley Savon Foods, Langley Safeway, and Aldegrove Fresco for donating the grocery bags.
[1943.70 --> 1945.80]  But above all, I want to thank God.
[1946.76 --> 1951.92]  Now, I want to welcome the director of the Langley Food Bank, Jim Calamance, to the mic.
[1952.84 --> 1956.50]  Pastor Jim will give us an update on what's happening.
[1958.66 --> 1959.40]  Thank you, Emanuel.
[1960.54 --> 1963.62]  Thank you once again for allowing me to come back and to talk to you again.
[1963.66 --> 1968.64]  I think it was late fall last year that I came, and this is amazing.
[1968.82 --> 1969.56]  Thank you so much.
[1970.20 --> 1975.42]  Our warehouses are getting empty, and so this is really an amazing shot in the arm for us.
[1975.42 --> 1980.54]  We really appreciate all that you have done, and the Lord is very good.
[1981.34 --> 1982.62]  Thank you for your support.
[1983.76 --> 1988.30]  The Langley Food Bank is growing, and there are so many people coming.
[1988.90 --> 1990.74]  We have people coming from all nations.
[1990.74 --> 1997.88]  We have Afghanistan, Mexico, Nigeria, India, Iraq, Iran.
[1998.48 --> 2005.32]  We have over 100 Ukrainian families coming now, and God is allowing us to be able to meet their needs.
[2005.32 --> 2010.90]  In May, we had 47 brand-new families show up.
[2011.56 --> 2014.94]  In June, 52 brand-new families.
[2015.74 --> 2025.50]  In the month of June, we served 4,800, 4,800 over that amount of people that came, individuals,
[2025.50 --> 2028.84]  from just the Langley Food Bank alone and Aldergrove.
[2029.88 --> 2031.20]  We've been getting seniors now.
[2031.66 --> 2035.80]  They just can't make it any longer, and so they're coming saying, you know, can I apply?
[2036.92 --> 2042.18]  And once again, you have to be a resident, and you have to have a certain financial backing to come, or lack of it.
[2042.70 --> 2048.62]  Wednesday nights, we have opened up from 515 to 615, and we have people coming there.
[2048.62 --> 2057.72]  80% of those people are Ukrainian families who have gotten jobs, and it's silly for them to leave their job during the day and to come to us.
[2057.74 --> 2060.32]  So we've opened up Wednesday nights as well.
[2062.68 --> 2069.38]  Let me tell you three quick stories just to tell you what this kind of food impact does for us.
[2070.98 --> 2075.50]  The first story is a man named Jag, a South Asian gentleman.
[2075.50 --> 2076.76]  He comes up to the table.
[2076.76 --> 2082.42]  I happen to be out there, and he says, I'm recently homeless, mid-30s.
[2082.78 --> 2084.16]  My wife kicked me out of the house.
[2085.48 --> 2086.76]  I said, I'm sorry to hear that.
[2087.30 --> 2089.46]  I said, you know, how can I help you?
[2089.52 --> 2090.78]  He says, well, first I need some food.
[2090.86 --> 2092.20]  And I said, sure, let me get you some food.
[2092.62 --> 2096.78]  So as I come out again, I said, you know, I can give you more help.
[2097.74 --> 2099.72]  And there's a person who can help you.
[2099.76 --> 2100.40]  His name is Jesus.
[2101.40 --> 2103.40]  And I said, would you mind if I talk to you about him?
[2103.40 --> 2104.76]  And we could pray together.
[2104.76 --> 2106.94]  And so I shared with him the gospel.
[2107.60 --> 2110.12]  And we prayed to put my hand on his shoulder.
[2110.86 --> 2116.20]  And when we opened our eyes, he was crying, tears pouring down his cheeks.
[2116.84 --> 2120.36]  He says, you're the first person that's helped me in days.
[2121.02 --> 2125.02]  He says, my family, even my own wife, will not help me.
[2125.02 --> 2128.44]  I said, well, that's because we're here because of Jesus.
[2129.42 --> 2133.94]  And would you think about coming to my church next Sunday?
[2134.28 --> 2135.62]  And he says, where is it?
[2136.00 --> 2138.92]  And I waited for him, but he did not show.
[2140.08 --> 2145.46]  So pray for Jack that he will find Jesus as a savior.
[2145.46 --> 2152.22]  The second story is we have a retired pastor who on Wednesdays, he kind of works the crowd.
[2153.04 --> 2155.30]  And so he's talking to people.
[2155.52 --> 2157.86]  And right now he's giving them a challenge to read through John.
[2158.24 --> 2160.72]  And one particular young lady he talked to was from India.
[2161.16 --> 2162.92]  And she had just come here for university.
[2163.60 --> 2166.76]  And so she had been coming for three, four weeks.
[2166.82 --> 2167.70]  He got to know her.
[2167.70 --> 2170.84]  And she, but she was going through some struggles.
[2171.60 --> 2176.80]  So she showed up again and she said, Pastor Dell, can I talk to you?
[2177.26 --> 2178.24]  And he says, sure.
[2178.62 --> 2184.92]  So as they were talking in the corner of the parking lot, he, she told him that that morning
[2184.92 --> 2187.10]  she was in worship to her God.
[2187.32 --> 2188.04]  She's Hindu.
[2188.94 --> 2195.98]  And her God told her to go to the Langley Food Bank and to talk to that pastor.
[2195.98 --> 2199.18]  Because he will have wisdom for your problem.
[2200.50 --> 2201.76]  So not bad.
[2202.56 --> 2207.04]  Other G gods are recommending our gospel and Jesus Christ.
[2207.92 --> 2210.98]  And then the last thing, and as you know, I used to be a pastor.
[2211.10 --> 2216.28]  And what brings great joy to my heart is when our clients realize that they need the gospel
[2216.28 --> 2217.56]  and they start attending churches.
[2218.34 --> 2222.90]  And right now we can count probably three or four of our clients that have started attending
[2222.90 --> 2226.96]  a church because they've come to the Langley Food Bank for food.
[2227.94 --> 2233.76]  One particular client, I won't say their name, but they started coming, got to know one of our volunteers.
[2234.32 --> 2239.84]  And that volunteer said to them, hey, would you come to church with my wife and I next Sunday?
[2240.84 --> 2241.72]  And she came.
[2241.72 --> 2244.78]  And she started going to that church.
[2245.30 --> 2247.82]  And after a while, she was led to Jesus.
[2249.08 --> 2252.98]  And after a while, she became a member of that church.
[2254.86 --> 2259.94]  So God bless you for all you're doing in support of the Langley Food Bank.
[2260.52 --> 2263.34]  Because together, we're spreading the gospel.
[2263.96 --> 2265.62]  We're giving out way more than food.
[2265.62 --> 2274.14]  But that food there allows us a bridge to be able to talk about the living bread, Jesus Christ.
[2275.22 --> 2277.82]  So Lord, may the Lord bless you and keep you.
[2277.96 --> 2282.48]  May he shine his face upon you and be gracious to you and give you peace.
[2283.10 --> 2283.58]  God bless you.
[2283.58 --> 2313.56]  Thank you.
[2313.58 --> 2343.56]  Thank you.
[2343.58 --> 2345.58]  Thank you.
[2373.58 --> 2375.58]  Thank you.
[2375.58 --> 2376.58]  Thank you.
[2376.58 --> 2378.58]  Thank you.
[2378.58 --> 2379.58]  Thank you.
[2403.58 --> 2405.58]  Thank you.
[2405.58 --> 2406.58]  Thank you.
[2406.58 --> 2407.58]  Thank you.
[2433.58 --> 2434.58]  Thank you.
[2434.58 --> 2435.14]  Thank you.
[2435.58 --> 2436.24]  Thank you.
[2436.58 --> 2436.78]  Thank you.
[2436.78 --> 2439.60]  The place is there.
[2440.74 --> 2441.90]  The place is there.
[2447.00 --> 2454.50]  I would love to invite all of the kids for preschool age,
[2454.58 --> 2457.42]  going into kindergarten, maybe just in kindergarten recently.
[2457.56 --> 2459.14]  Why don't you come up to the front right now?
[2459.58 --> 2460.88]  I'm going to pray with you.
[2460.96 --> 2461.66]  Yeah, you come right up.
[2462.36 --> 2463.52]  I'm going to pray with you,
[2463.66 --> 2466.04]  and then we're going to go to children's worship time together, okay?
[2466.04 --> 2466.18]  Okay.
[2468.90 --> 2469.78]  Good job.
[2474.76 --> 2475.56]  All right.
[2477.02 --> 2479.52]  Can you guys pray with me before we go to children's worship time?
[2479.70 --> 2479.86]  Yeah?
[2480.36 --> 2481.68]  All right, let's fold our hands, okay?
[2481.76 --> 2482.28]  Close our eyes.
[2482.70 --> 2484.56]  Dear God, thank you that we could come to church today.
[2484.90 --> 2487.00]  Thank you that we could go to children's worship time,
[2487.06 --> 2487.88]  learn more about you.
[2488.16 --> 2490.98]  We pray for these kids who are going to learn some stories
[2490.98 --> 2493.06]  and have some fun in the back and be with the grown-ups too.
[2493.12 --> 2494.58]  We're going to do the same thing in here.
[2494.58 --> 2497.66]  We pray that we will all draw closer to you today in your name.
[2498.02 --> 2498.34]  Amen.
[2499.06 --> 2499.50]  All right.
[2499.60 --> 2501.00]  Let's do the blessing, okay?
[2501.08 --> 2501.84]  Can we do that together?
[2502.20 --> 2503.44]  So church is going to stand up.
[2503.82 --> 2505.52]  We're going to say there's only six of us.
[2505.58 --> 2506.46]  We have to be really loud.
[2506.56 --> 2507.14]  Can we do that?
[2507.48 --> 2508.72]  We're going to say the Lord be with you.
[2508.76 --> 2509.20]  Are you ready?
[2509.86 --> 2510.22]  All right.
[2510.96 --> 2513.32]  The Lord be with you.
[2513.72 --> 2515.22]  And also with you.
[2515.30 --> 2515.84]  Great job.
[2515.84 --> 2517.56]  Okay, you guys can go to children's worship time.
[2517.56 --> 2518.12]  Thank you.
[2518.12 --> 2546.66]  Good morning.
[2546.66 --> 2549.18]  My name is Dave. I'm one of the elders in our church.
[2549.98 --> 2554.42]  Before we go to our church family prayer, a couple of updates from our bulletin.
[2555.94 --> 2561.10]  The bulletin does point out that Ellen White, who we've been praying for for a while, is going to Langley Hospital.
[2561.42 --> 2563.78]  The further update is that she is going home.
[2564.28 --> 2571.12]  She is going to need some home care, so those health concerns are still ongoing, but that is a very important development.
[2571.12 --> 2578.76]  And the bulletin also points out that Margaret Schoen was waiting for surgery sometime this month or next.
[2579.16 --> 2585.02]  I've just heard an update that she now gets to go in next Wednesday, so that is very good news.
[2585.02 --> 2589.10]  Let us all turn to our God and our church family prayer.
[2592.38 --> 2594.82]  Father, this is the day that you have made.
[2595.20 --> 2597.44]  We rejoice and we are glad in it.
[2598.04 --> 2602.32]  We thank you for the opportunity that we have to meet in your house, to meet in your church,
[2602.46 --> 2607.62]  that we get to join with Christians everywhere, with the church universal, to celebrate your name.
[2607.62 --> 2612.74]  We thank you for the message that we could hear today as it comes from Hebrews 11.
[2613.38 --> 2620.48]  We hear those encouraging words that faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we cannot see.
[2621.44 --> 2628.38]  When we read Hebrews 11, we hear about many ordinary, flawed, sinful people who did great things
[2628.38 --> 2631.96]  because of their faith in you and because of you working in them.
[2631.96 --> 2636.54]  We pray for ourselves that we, too, can be agents of your kingdom
[2636.54 --> 2642.18]  and that we can do good things for others because of our faith in you and you working in us.
[2643.04 --> 2644.52]  Father, we thank you for summertime.
[2645.04 --> 2650.08]  It is a chance for so many of us to rest, to travel, to spend time with family.
[2650.56 --> 2654.90]  And when we travel, a lot of us spend time outdoors to enjoy your creation.
[2655.44 --> 2659.34]  We look at all that you have made and we know that it is very good.
[2659.34 --> 2663.70]  While we enjoy the nice weather when we can,
[2664.04 --> 2672.22]  we also recognize the difficulties that it creates for so many people with drought, with forest fires.
[2672.74 --> 2677.76]  We think about those who are farmers and grow food for others
[2677.76 --> 2680.78]  and that this looks like a very difficult season for them.
[2681.30 --> 2687.40]  We recognize that when great heat comes, it is very difficult for the vulnerable.
[2687.40 --> 2694.02]  Father, we pray for all of us that we can endure the difficult weather when it happens
[2694.02 --> 2702.04]  and that this will be an opportunity to lean on each other and to provide support for each other.
[2702.70 --> 2705.34]  It also reminds us about our need for creation care,
[2705.68 --> 2710.08]  that we need to work to limit our impact on the world that you have made.
[2710.08 --> 2717.12]  Father, we continue to pray for needs of our congregation and people connected with it.
[2717.72 --> 2720.58]  We thank you that Ellen White has a chance to go home.
[2721.90 --> 2724.88]  She still is going to need some kind of home care,
[2725.34 --> 2727.70]  but we do thank you for that development,
[2727.84 --> 2730.80]  that she could spend time at home and not time in hospital.
[2730.80 --> 2738.44]  We pray for Klaus Tessemaker, who is in hospital for his health needs.
[2738.78 --> 2743.12]  We pray that you will be with him as he endures that difficulty.
[2743.72 --> 2748.10]  We thank you for the good news that Marquette gets to have surgery next Wednesday.
[2748.56 --> 2752.60]  We pray for her doctors, nurses, all the caregivers who will be taking care of her
[2752.60 --> 2756.22]  and that this will be a successful surgery for her.
[2756.92 --> 2763.16]  We pray for those of us who are taking care of aging parents or who worry about their health.
[2763.50 --> 2767.36]  We thank you for the work that they have done for us over the years
[2767.36 --> 2771.46]  and the love that they have shown for their families.
[2772.00 --> 2775.04]  We pray for members of our church who are mourning,
[2775.36 --> 2780.08]  whether it is a loss that has happened recently or a loss that happened some time ago.
[2780.08 --> 2782.66]  We pray that they will feel your comfort and your strength.
[2783.18 --> 2787.52]  We pray for those who are broken and hurting for whatever challenges that they face.
[2787.90 --> 2792.30]  We pray for those who are facing anxiety or other issues of mental health,
[2792.46 --> 2795.52]  that they may feel your comfort, that they may feel your healing.
[2796.52 --> 2799.16]  Father, we pray for this church.
[2799.82 --> 2802.24]  We thank you for the ministries that we could have here.
[2802.62 --> 2804.56]  Many of them are on hiatus for the summertime,
[2804.56 --> 2809.86]  but we do thank you for opportunities to build community,
[2810.08 --> 2813.84]  and learn more about you.
[2814.40 --> 2817.38]  We pray for Kevin, who is going to be leading us in our message today,
[2817.56 --> 2819.96]  that we will learn more about Moses,
[2820.50 --> 2824.22]  one of many great heroes of the faith.
[2825.32 --> 2829.32]  And, Father, to you who is able to keep us from falling,
[2829.66 --> 2834.12]  be glory, majesty, power, and authority through Jesus Christ our Lord
[2834.12 --> 2836.84]  before all ages now and forevermore.
[2837.62 --> 2837.88]  Amen.
[2837.88 --> 2837.98]  Amen.
[2840.08 --> 2868.32]  Good morning, everyone.
[2868.32 --> 2871.76]  As I sit out here and I look at all your faces,
[2871.92 --> 2874.38]  I see Klaus Tesemacher sitting right there as well.
[2874.48 --> 2876.36]  So we prayed for him because he was in the hospital.
[2876.84 --> 2879.36]  When we prepare for these prayers and for these services,
[2879.36 --> 2881.82]  we hear news and then we see results of that.
[2881.84 --> 2883.10]  So we're grateful to see you here, Klaus.
[2883.56 --> 2884.20]  Doing well.
[2884.26 --> 2884.56]  Thank you.
[2885.70 --> 2887.14]  When I was in grade 12,
[2887.52 --> 2891.10]  I remember trying out for the senior boys basketball team.
[2891.66 --> 2893.86]  I had played basketball all throughout school,
[2893.96 --> 2896.62]  so I wasn't really worried about this tryout so much.
[2896.62 --> 2898.12]  I thought it was going to be a bit of a cakewalk.
[2898.54 --> 2899.66]  But boy, was I wrong.
[2900.46 --> 2903.04]  The coaches decided to do not just the tryouts
[2903.04 --> 2905.06]  for the senior boys basketball team that day,
[2905.12 --> 2907.70]  but also for the senior girls and the junior boys.
[2908.06 --> 2910.72]  So there was three teams that they were looking at,
[2910.78 --> 2912.96]  and there was over 70 students in that gym
[2912.96 --> 2915.06]  vying to be on those three teams.
[2915.06 --> 2917.54]  Now, there were some passing drills and shooting drills
[2917.54 --> 2918.46]  and sort of the norms.
[2918.60 --> 2919.78]  There was lots of line running,
[2919.96 --> 2922.14]  and all six coaches had their clipboards out
[2922.14 --> 2922.86]  and taking notes.
[2923.20 --> 2926.50]  It was all very standard until the last drill.
[2927.70 --> 2929.14]  Now, because more kids showed up
[2929.14 --> 2930.22]  than they originally thought,
[2930.56 --> 2933.40]  the coaches decided to separate the wheat from the chaff.
[2933.66 --> 2935.08]  That's what they said before the drill.
[2935.20 --> 2937.20]  So that was discouraging right at the beginning.
[2938.06 --> 2942.68]  They lined up all 70 of us students along the wall,
[2943.02 --> 2944.70]  and they made us do a wall sit.
[2944.76 --> 2946.86]  Now, a wall sit's when you put your back against the wall,
[2946.92 --> 2949.88]  and then you sit at a 90-degree angle at your knees,
[2950.38 --> 2952.34]  and it just really burns the quads.
[2952.84 --> 2954.60]  And so they had all seven of us sitting there,
[2954.62 --> 2956.66]  and then each of the six coaches took a basketball,
[2957.20 --> 2958.76]  and they said, we're going to go down the line,
[2958.76 --> 2960.74]  and we're going to go all the way down and all the way back,
[2960.80 --> 2962.34]  and all six of us are going to pass the ball
[2962.34 --> 2963.46]  to all 70 of you,
[2963.82 --> 2964.88]  and we're going to go all the way down
[2964.88 --> 2966.18]  and all the way back.
[2966.50 --> 2969.84]  And if anyone slips or falls or stands up
[2969.84 --> 2972.16]  or misses the ball or can't pass it back,
[2972.56 --> 2973.72]  we're starting over again.
[2975.10 --> 2979.34]  That was the longest 43 minutes and 12 seconds of my life.
[2980.80 --> 2982.80]  We finally accomplished a task,
[2982.84 --> 2984.26]  and I remember standing up in victory
[2984.26 --> 2985.58]  and then crumpling to the ground
[2985.58 --> 2986.88]  because my legs stopped working,
[2986.88 --> 2988.42]  and it took me a good five minutes
[2988.42 --> 2990.04]  for the blood to flow back into the legs
[2990.04 --> 2991.22]  and get rolling again.
[2991.28 --> 2992.30]  But what was really great
[2992.30 --> 2994.78]  was that this drill called for some perseverance.
[2994.88 --> 2996.96]  None of the 70-plus people quit.
[2997.78 --> 2998.98]  They had said, you can quit.
[2999.08 --> 3000.80]  You can stand up and leave any time,
[3000.92 --> 3002.54]  but if you do, there's a possibility
[3002.54 --> 3003.92]  that you might not make the team,
[3003.98 --> 3004.70]  but nobody did.
[3005.36 --> 3007.84]  And we leaned against that wall as 70 students
[3007.84 --> 3009.36]  for as long as it took Scooby-Doo
[3009.36 --> 3011.28]  to solve not one but two mysteries.
[3012.16 --> 3013.54]  So good old high school.
[3014.22 --> 3015.76]  Now we're going to continue our sermon series
[3015.76 --> 3017.04]  on heroes of faith today
[3017.04 --> 3019.10]  and look at another Old Testament hero,
[3019.22 --> 3020.94]  someone who had to persevere
[3020.94 --> 3024.44]  through so much more than a basketball tryout.
[3024.44 --> 3027.60]  Now this guy is a pretty popular Bible character,
[3027.80 --> 3030.12]  and he's a guy whose story takes up
[3030.12 --> 3031.98]  four whole books of the Bible.
[3032.34 --> 3033.90]  We're going to look at Moses today.
[3034.52 --> 3036.86]  But instead of reading the entirety of Exodus 2
[3036.86 --> 3038.02]  to Deuteronomy 34,
[3038.46 --> 3041.54]  we're going to read the Hebrews passage
[3041.54 --> 3043.80]  on what makes Moses one of the heroes of faith.
[3043.84 --> 3045.10]  So if you have your Bibles with us,
[3045.18 --> 3046.26]  and with you, and I hope you do,
[3046.52 --> 3048.36]  please turn with me now to Hebrews 11,
[3048.94 --> 3051.40]  and we're going to read verses 23 to 28.
[3051.40 --> 3053.28]  Now please keep those Bibles close to you
[3053.28 --> 3054.04]  because as always,
[3054.12 --> 3055.96]  we're going to be going back to that passage
[3055.96 --> 3057.10]  throughout the morning.
[3057.88 --> 3060.62]  So Hebrews 11, 23 to 28 says this,
[3061.30 --> 3064.24]  By faith, Moses' parents hid him
[3064.24 --> 3065.98]  for three months after he was born
[3065.98 --> 3068.78]  because they saw he was no ordinary child,
[3069.08 --> 3071.34]  and they were not afraid of the king's edict.
[3071.84 --> 3074.06]  By faith, Moses, when he had grown up,
[3074.40 --> 3077.06]  refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh's daughter.
[3077.06 --> 3080.90]  He chose to be mistreated along with the people of God
[3080.90 --> 3084.44]  rather than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin.
[3085.32 --> 3087.56]  He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ
[3087.56 --> 3090.62]  as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt
[3090.62 --> 3092.90]  because he was looking ahead to his reward.
[3093.96 --> 3095.16]  By faith, he left Egypt,
[3095.28 --> 3096.80]  not fearing the king's anger.
[3097.48 --> 3100.34]  He persevered because he saw him who is invisible.
[3101.52 --> 3103.08]  By faith, he kept the Passover
[3103.08 --> 3104.96]  and the application of blood
[3104.96 --> 3106.86]  so that the destroyer of the firstborn
[3106.86 --> 3110.18]  would not touch the firstborn of Israel.
[3110.82 --> 3112.10]  The word of the Lord.
[3114.44 --> 3116.30]  So this Hebrews text today
[3116.30 --> 3118.62]  gives us some reason why Moses was considered
[3118.62 --> 3119.54]  a hero of faith.
[3119.66 --> 3121.82]  Moses chose to be mistreated,
[3122.42 --> 3124.62]  rather enjoy the comforts in his life.
[3124.70 --> 3127.36]  He chose to align himself with God
[3127.36 --> 3128.70]  and be disgraced
[3128.70 --> 3130.86]  rather than enjoy the treasures,
[3131.06 --> 3132.32]  all of the treasures of Egypt.
[3132.68 --> 3133.44]  He was fearless.
[3133.44 --> 3136.46]  Even while in the crosshairs of Pharaoh,
[3136.70 --> 3138.90]  and he kept faith in God,
[3139.10 --> 3141.20]  even if what God was asking him to do
[3141.20 --> 3142.04]  seemed impossible.
[3143.18 --> 3145.24]  In short, my prayer is,
[3145.34 --> 3147.08]  as we leave here today this morning,
[3147.60 --> 3149.98]  we hear that Moses was a hero of faith
[3149.98 --> 3152.56]  because no matter the calling or the cost,
[3153.42 --> 3155.52]  Moses fixed his eyes on Christ
[3155.52 --> 3157.38]  and persevered in his faith.
[3157.38 --> 3159.62]  Or to use Moses as an example
[3159.62 --> 3161.18]  for what we are to do,
[3162.44 --> 3165.14]  no matter the calling or the cost,
[3165.36 --> 3168.66]  we are to fix our eyes on Christ
[3168.66 --> 3170.56]  and persevere in our faith.
[3171.84 --> 3173.44]  Now Moses' story backs this up,
[3173.50 --> 3175.40]  so let's take some snapshots of his life.
[3176.02 --> 3177.98]  In Exodus 2, verses 1 to 10,
[3178.06 --> 3179.06]  while he was an infant,
[3179.50 --> 3180.30]  Moses' mother,
[3180.38 --> 3181.92]  he puts Moses in a basket
[3181.92 --> 3183.00]  into the Nile River
[3183.00 --> 3184.80]  and saves him from certain death
[3184.80 --> 3186.40]  because Pharaoh was killing
[3186.40 --> 3188.54]  all of the sons in Egypt.
[3188.62 --> 3190.86]  Not only did Moses get saved in that moment,
[3191.00 --> 3192.44]  but he ends up getting adopted
[3192.44 --> 3193.64]  by Pharaoh's daughter
[3193.64 --> 3196.10]  and grows up in the palaces of Egypt.
[3196.98 --> 3198.16]  Now Moses was an infant,
[3198.28 --> 3200.94]  so how can you credit this to his faith,
[3201.06 --> 3201.74]  you might ask?
[3202.94 --> 3205.04]  Well, just because Moses wasn't even active
[3205.04 --> 3206.78]  in his own life at this point
[3206.78 --> 3209.24]  doesn't mean that God wasn't active in it.
[3209.24 --> 3212.14]  See, Moses' faith, it grew
[3212.14 --> 3214.00]  because of what God's activity
[3214.00 --> 3215.46]  in his life was.
[3215.96 --> 3218.06]  Whether we contemplate this or not,
[3218.12 --> 3219.70]  if we have eyes to see
[3219.70 --> 3222.22]  what God is doing in our lives,
[3222.46 --> 3224.72]  even without our own involvement,
[3225.04 --> 3227.44]  we can come to grow in our faith.
[3228.38 --> 3230.06]  So Moses' calling had started early
[3230.06 --> 3232.18]  as God sort of set him apart from infancy
[3232.18 --> 3233.54]  to live out this calling.
[3234.16 --> 3236.54]  And so for the first third of Moses' life,
[3236.60 --> 3237.76]  his first 40 years,
[3237.76 --> 3240.00]  Moses learned of the Egyptian culture
[3240.00 --> 3241.82]  in an Egyptian palace,
[3242.12 --> 3243.92]  just a bedroom or eight away
[3243.92 --> 3246.22]  from where Pharaoh laid his head down at night.
[3247.48 --> 3249.90]  The next recorded event in Moses' story
[3249.90 --> 3251.92]  is Exodus 2, 11 to 25.
[3252.42 --> 3253.90]  Moses sees one of his people
[3253.90 --> 3255.64]  getting beaten by an Egyptian soldier,
[3256.10 --> 3257.72]  and so he goes and kills the aggressor
[3257.72 --> 3258.78]  with his own two hands.
[3259.18 --> 3262.00]  That move, though, costs Moses dearly
[3262.00 --> 3264.78]  because he had to flee from the palace,
[3265.72 --> 3267.60]  from his life of comfort,
[3267.76 --> 3268.96]  from his life of wealth.
[3270.50 --> 3272.26]  God would use this sin, though,
[3272.32 --> 3274.06]  to prepare Moses for his calling,
[3274.22 --> 3276.80]  and Moses spends the second third of his life,
[3277.08 --> 3278.62]  his second 40 years,
[3279.14 --> 3280.62]  shepherding in the desert,
[3281.00 --> 3282.46]  learning about the wilderness
[3282.46 --> 3285.10]  and how to care for wandering sheep.
[3286.10 --> 3288.54]  And then comes Moses' third third of life,
[3289.26 --> 3290.48]  his final 40 years,
[3290.54 --> 3292.10]  where God's calling on his life
[3292.10 --> 3293.34]  becomes even more pronounced.
[3293.34 --> 3296.84]  God meets Moses in a burning bush in Exodus 3
[3296.84 --> 3300.40]  and calls Moses to lead his people out of Egypt,
[3300.58 --> 3301.82]  out of the land of slavery,
[3301.82 --> 3303.40]  and into the promised land.
[3303.54 --> 3305.14]  And the rest of Moses' story
[3305.14 --> 3307.38]  is told over four books of the Bible,
[3307.98 --> 3309.98]  Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy.
[3310.88 --> 3312.14]  Now, people know this story.
[3312.88 --> 3314.36]  Christians and non-Christians alike
[3314.36 --> 3316.32]  have heard the story of Moses and the Exodus.
[3316.60 --> 3318.56]  It's been made into countless children's books.
[3318.56 --> 3320.68]  Artists have been painting this story
[3320.68 --> 3323.02]  and aspects of this story for centuries.
[3323.44 --> 3325.70]  Even Hollywood has made movies about it.
[3326.42 --> 3328.54]  In fact, according to Wikipedia,
[3328.74 --> 3330.94]  there are 15 Hollywood movies
[3330.94 --> 3332.72]  about the story of Moses,
[3332.82 --> 3334.74]  many of them quite terrible.
[3336.16 --> 3339.68]  But what isn't always shown in these movies
[3339.68 --> 3343.86]  is the cost of God's call on Moses' life.
[3345.54 --> 3348.12]  Moses dealt with violence and anger.
[3348.12 --> 3352.00]  Remember, God used 10 plagues on the Egyptians,
[3352.24 --> 3353.34]  significant plagues,
[3353.46 --> 3355.18]  ranging from infestation of frogs
[3355.18 --> 3356.60]  to locusts to boils,
[3357.06 --> 3358.74]  and the ninth plague
[3358.74 --> 3361.32]  covering the whole land in darkness for days.
[3362.18 --> 3363.40]  After that ninth plague,
[3363.58 --> 3365.32]  Pharaoh is livid at Moses,
[3365.56 --> 3367.20]  and he says in Exodus 10, 28,
[3367.48 --> 3368.44]  get out of my sight,
[3368.72 --> 3370.98]  make sure you do not appear before me again.
[3371.24 --> 3373.02]  The day you see my face,
[3373.24 --> 3374.20]  you will die.
[3374.20 --> 3378.64]  But Moses persevered in his calling,
[3379.26 --> 3380.72]  even against Pharaoh's anger.
[3381.82 --> 3382.96]  And then a few chapters later,
[3383.04 --> 3383.78]  Exodus 14,
[3384.12 --> 3385.46]  Pharaoh changes his mind,
[3385.78 --> 3387.26]  and God sends the final plague,
[3387.34 --> 3387.90]  the tenth one,
[3387.96 --> 3390.30]  where all of the firstborn sons in Egypt die.
[3391.42 --> 3393.50]  The Israelites are told to leave once and for all,
[3393.58 --> 3394.00]  but again,
[3394.10 --> 3395.64]  the anger of Pharaoh returns,
[3395.90 --> 3397.74]  and he sets out to kill not just Moses,
[3397.88 --> 3398.98]  but all of God's people.
[3398.98 --> 3403.10]  But Moses persevered in his calling
[3403.10 --> 3405.32]  without fear of Pharaoh.
[3406.94 --> 3408.00]  With God's interceding,
[3408.08 --> 3410.06]  the Israelites cross the Sea of Reeds safely,
[3410.24 --> 3412.10]  but then very quickly start whining
[3412.10 --> 3413.66]  about their situation.
[3414.50 --> 3414.98]  Now remember,
[3415.10 --> 3416.44]  there was conservatively
[3416.44 --> 3419.44]  about 2.5 million Israelites,
[3420.26 --> 3422.98]  many of them now whining and complaining
[3422.98 --> 3425.46]  about their situation and their new digs.
[3426.22 --> 3427.34]  I just had youth camp
[3427.34 --> 3428.84]  with 35 youth and leaders.
[3429.44 --> 3431.72]  I heard them whining about their digs all weekend,
[3432.02 --> 3433.60]  and that was enough for me.
[3433.84 --> 3437.36]  I can't imagine 2.5 million people whining
[3437.36 --> 3438.78]  for 40 years
[3438.78 --> 3440.34]  about where he had taken them.
[3441.22 --> 3443.38]  But Moses persevered in his calling
[3443.38 --> 3446.22]  and continued to lead an ungrateful people.
[3446.30 --> 3447.48]  Now, side note actually,
[3447.82 --> 3449.60]  the youth camp on the screen behind me,
[3449.64 --> 3451.14]  the youth and leaders were actually quite delightful.
[3451.28 --> 3452.08]  They weren't bad at all.
[3452.50 --> 3453.96]  They were absolute champions.
[3453.96 --> 3457.48]  They did end up sleeping in a super sketch chalet
[3457.48 --> 3459.54]  in the bush at Mount Seymour,
[3459.68 --> 3461.34]  and we knew we shared that chalet
[3461.34 --> 3462.66]  with a lot of furry little rodents
[3462.66 --> 3464.00]  because we saw the poop on our beds
[3464.00 --> 3464.76]  when we showed up there.
[3464.98 --> 3466.38]  But I needed an example,
[3466.52 --> 3467.22]  and I thought that would do.
[3467.30 --> 3467.86]  So there you go.
[3469.64 --> 3471.68]  Even in his sin, though,
[3472.02 --> 3473.08]  Moses persevered.
[3473.82 --> 3475.42]  Now, we heard about the murder he committed
[3475.42 --> 3476.38]  back in Exodus 2,
[3476.46 --> 3477.88]  but actually in Numbers 20,
[3477.94 --> 3479.42]  we read about another moment
[3479.42 --> 3481.52]  where in a bout of frustration,
[3481.84 --> 3483.56]  Moses takes credit for a miracle
[3483.56 --> 3484.64]  that God performed
[3484.64 --> 3486.54]  rather than giving God the glory,
[3486.74 --> 3487.94]  and his punishment for that
[3487.94 --> 3489.76]  was to not enter the promised land
[3489.76 --> 3490.92]  with God's people.
[3492.42 --> 3495.36]  But Moses persevered even in his sin
[3495.36 --> 3498.40]  because he had his eyes fixed on God,
[3498.82 --> 3501.08]  and he knew what his reward would be.
[3501.64 --> 3503.42]  See, that's the thread of Moses' story
[3503.42 --> 3504.36]  over and over again.
[3504.36 --> 3506.46]  Because of God's calling on his life,
[3506.76 --> 3508.16]  no matter the cost to him,
[3508.16 --> 3510.82]  Moses persevered in his faith.
[3511.44 --> 3512.88]  Verse 27 of our text,
[3513.18 --> 3515.02]  By faith Moses left Egypt.
[3515.32 --> 3517.88]  He persevered because he saw him
[3517.88 --> 3518.98]  who is invisible.
[3521.04 --> 3523.54]  Knowing God was key.
[3524.40 --> 3527.46]  Knowing God allowed him to persevere
[3527.46 --> 3529.12]  and choose a life of faithfulness
[3529.12 --> 3531.02]  over a life of comfort.
[3531.24 --> 3532.24]  No matter the cost,
[3532.56 --> 3534.98]  Moses knew God and persevered in his faith.
[3534.98 --> 3536.36]  That is Moses' story.
[3536.48 --> 3537.90]  That is Moses' testimony.
[3537.90 --> 3539.74]  His example for us today.
[3539.88 --> 3541.10]  So what does that mean for us?
[3541.52 --> 3542.78]  What is our calling?
[3543.38 --> 3545.14]  What is the cost to us?
[3546.00 --> 3546.88]  We'll look at those two things,
[3546.94 --> 3547.92]  our calling and our cost.
[3548.00 --> 3548.54]  First, our calling.
[3549.70 --> 3550.74]  As Moses did,
[3551.32 --> 3553.22]  our calling is to live our lives
[3553.22 --> 3554.48]  to glorify God
[3554.48 --> 3556.62]  and to love others above ourselves.
[3557.56 --> 3559.38]  This is found throughout Scripture.
[3559.82 --> 3562.32]  John the Baptist says in John 3, verse 30,
[3562.32 --> 3563.96]  that he, Jesus,
[3564.38 --> 3565.80]  must become greater
[3565.80 --> 3567.72]  and I become less,
[3567.80 --> 3568.62]  must become less.
[3568.86 --> 3570.30]  Paul gives a similar calling
[3570.30 --> 3573.86]  in Philippians 2, verses 3 to 4.
[3574.22 --> 3575.74]  Do nothing out of selfish ambition
[3575.74 --> 3576.56]  or vain conceit.
[3576.94 --> 3577.86]  Rather, in humility,
[3578.36 --> 3580.78]  value others above yourselves.
[3580.78 --> 3582.88]  not looking to your own interests,
[3582.88 --> 3584.34]  but each of you
[3584.34 --> 3586.06]  to the interest of others.
[3587.10 --> 3588.62]  And then Jesus himself, of course,
[3588.78 --> 3589.76]  time and time again,
[3589.84 --> 3590.84]  but in Matthew 22,
[3590.94 --> 3592.88]  he quotes the Old Testament passages
[3592.88 --> 3595.04]  of Deuteronomy 6 and Leviticus 9.
[3595.14 --> 3595.52]  He says,
[3596.28 --> 3597.20]  Love the Lord your God
[3597.20 --> 3598.12]  with all your heart
[3598.12 --> 3599.18]  and with all your soul
[3599.18 --> 3600.30]  and with all your mind
[3600.30 --> 3602.92]  and love your neighbor as yourself.
[3602.92 --> 3607.42]  We're called to sacrifice ourselves
[3607.42 --> 3608.54]  and live for others.
[3608.64 --> 3610.02]  Some of you who have been believers
[3610.02 --> 3611.02]  for a long time,
[3611.10 --> 3611.88]  you've been hearing this
[3611.88 --> 3612.94]  over and over again,
[3613.02 --> 3614.24]  time and time again,
[3614.40 --> 3616.60]  but that is what we are called to do.
[3616.80 --> 3619.56]  That is our calling here on this earth.
[3620.00 --> 3622.08]  That is what Moses was called to do.
[3622.92 --> 3623.84]  That's how he lived.
[3624.12 --> 3625.44]  That's what the book of Hebrews
[3625.44 --> 3626.52]  credits him for.
[3626.78 --> 3628.88]  He persevered in his faith.
[3630.26 --> 3632.34]  He persevered in his calling.
[3632.92 --> 3635.44]  Because of God's people.
[3636.28 --> 3637.70]  To lead God's people.
[3637.82 --> 3638.88]  To serve God's people.
[3639.10 --> 3639.92]  No matter the cost.
[3641.64 --> 3643.24]  Moses chose mistreatment
[3643.24 --> 3643.98]  rather than enjoy
[3643.98 --> 3645.34]  the fleeting pleasures of this world.
[3645.44 --> 3647.68]  That was verse 25 of our text.
[3647.78 --> 3648.98]  He regarded disgrace
[3648.98 --> 3650.18]  for the sake of Christ
[3650.18 --> 3651.38]  as greater value
[3651.38 --> 3652.58]  than the treasures of Egypt.
[3652.58 --> 3653.66]  Verse 26.
[3654.00 --> 3657.58]  He chose calling over comfort.
[3658.28 --> 3660.36]  He chose people over self.
[3661.62 --> 3662.88]  And that's our calling.
[3662.92 --> 3668.00]  I don't think it's a secret
[3668.00 --> 3669.04]  that our world pushes
[3669.04 --> 3670.78]  individualism very hard.
[3671.28 --> 3673.28]  That the rags to riches narrative
[3673.28 --> 3674.44]  is celebrated.
[3674.66 --> 3676.60]  It's strived for in our culture.
[3677.02 --> 3678.60]  Dream big, they say.
[3678.70 --> 3679.64]  Find your thing.
[3680.22 --> 3681.28]  Anything is possible
[3681.28 --> 3682.70]  if you believe hard enough.
[3683.02 --> 3684.06]  If you work hard enough.
[3684.14 --> 3685.72]  If you try hard enough.
[3686.22 --> 3687.18]  Believe in yourself
[3687.18 --> 3688.50]  and you can take on the world,
[3688.50 --> 3689.00]  we're told.
[3690.06 --> 3690.90]  Self-help books
[3690.90 --> 3693.32]  are still the most popular books
[3693.32 --> 3694.66]  off the shelves in bookstores.
[3695.52 --> 3696.88]  Exercising self-care.
[3697.30 --> 3698.74]  Attaining self-employment.
[3699.00 --> 3701.36]  Becoming a self-made person.
[3702.36 --> 3703.36]  All of those are goals
[3703.36 --> 3704.70]  for most in our society.
[3705.16 --> 3706.38]  Find your true self.
[3706.72 --> 3707.74]  Express yourself.
[3708.26 --> 3709.66]  Always be taking selfies.
[3710.06 --> 3712.44]  Show the world the true you.
[3713.40 --> 3715.90]  Self, self, self.
[3716.96 --> 3718.96]  You do you, we say.
[3719.86 --> 3721.08]  Be who you are.
[3722.72 --> 3723.86]  We tell people.
[3724.38 --> 3725.68]  Church, we have to see
[3725.68 --> 3727.10]  that Moses' story
[3727.10 --> 3728.46]  is the antithesis of this.
[3728.96 --> 3730.06]  We have to see
[3730.06 --> 3731.74]  that Moses' story
[3731.74 --> 3732.50]  is the opposite
[3732.50 --> 3734.12]  of the focus on yourself,
[3734.42 --> 3735.66]  little g gospel
[3735.66 --> 3737.06]  of the culture that we live in.
[3737.06 --> 3739.22]  Moses didn't go
[3739.22 --> 3740.22]  from rags to riches.
[3741.22 --> 3743.00]  He went from riches to rags.
[3743.94 --> 3744.82]  Moses didn't believe
[3744.82 --> 3745.54]  in his abilities.
[3745.70 --> 3747.62]  He questioned them very hard
[3747.62 --> 3749.34]  in the burning bush story
[3749.34 --> 3750.16]  in Exodus 3.
[3750.60 --> 3753.20]  But he believed in God
[3753.20 --> 3755.14]  and God's promises for him.
[3756.12 --> 3757.96]  Moses didn't place his identity
[3757.96 --> 3759.00]  in what he did
[3759.00 --> 3762.16]  or look deep within himself
[3762.16 --> 3763.34]  to find who he was.
[3764.16 --> 3765.42]  He discovered who he was
[3765.42 --> 3767.12]  by his relationship with God
[3767.12 --> 3768.58]  and living that out
[3768.58 --> 3769.28]  in the world.
[3770.36 --> 3771.60]  Moses didn't live his life
[3771.60 --> 3772.48]  for his own gain
[3772.48 --> 3773.28]  or his own comfort.
[3773.52 --> 3774.44]  In fact, he lost
[3774.44 --> 3775.64]  all of his comfort
[3775.64 --> 3776.70]  in his calling
[3776.70 --> 3777.42]  to lead the people
[3777.42 --> 3777.94]  out of Egypt.
[3779.26 --> 3780.96]  No, Moses lived his life
[3780.96 --> 3782.24]  for God's people,
[3783.10 --> 3783.60]  leading them,
[3783.72 --> 3784.14]  serving them,
[3784.18 --> 3785.10]  no matter the cost.
[3789.24 --> 3790.14]  The church here,
[3790.26 --> 3792.66]  I am so encouraged
[3792.66 --> 3794.66]  by you all so often
[3794.66 --> 3796.64]  because I see this calling
[3796.64 --> 3797.38]  being lived out
[3797.38 --> 3798.12]  in this community
[3798.12 --> 3799.50]  all of the time.
[3800.44 --> 3801.68]  Examples of faithfulness
[3801.68 --> 3803.48]  to God's calling
[3803.48 --> 3804.12]  being practiced
[3804.12 --> 3804.98]  by so many of you
[3804.98 --> 3805.52]  in this community.
[3805.70 --> 3807.10]  When people are in the hospital,
[3807.24 --> 3807.86]  you visit them.
[3808.26 --> 3809.48]  When engagements happen
[3809.48 --> 3810.54]  or babies are born,
[3810.62 --> 3811.66]  you celebrate together.
[3811.90 --> 3813.32]  When pandemics rage on,
[3813.66 --> 3815.26]  you meet at doorsteps
[3815.26 --> 3816.86]  and drop gifts off at home.
[3817.00 --> 3818.40]  When crises happen,
[3818.48 --> 3819.50]  you enter into them
[3819.50 --> 3820.02]  with people.
[3820.26 --> 3821.06]  You sit with them.
[3821.14 --> 3821.88]  You pray with them.
[3821.94 --> 3822.88]  You bring meals to them.
[3823.68 --> 3825.48]  When food banks need food,
[3827.18 --> 3828.72]  you lead the cause.
[3830.40 --> 3832.32]  I see it in women's ministries here.
[3832.46 --> 3833.74]  I see it in men's ministries,
[3833.90 --> 3834.74]  seniors' ministry,
[3835.10 --> 3835.66]  youth ministry,
[3835.80 --> 3836.46]  children's ministry,
[3836.54 --> 3837.30]  the work of the elders,
[3837.66 --> 3838.52]  the work of the deacons,
[3838.64 --> 3839.56]  and even separate
[3839.56 --> 3841.06]  from ministries altogether.
[3841.32 --> 3842.38]  In your day-to-day,
[3842.50 --> 3843.86]  I see you living this out
[3843.86 --> 3844.70]  simply because
[3844.70 --> 3845.74]  that's what it means
[3845.74 --> 3847.54]  to be a community.
[3847.72 --> 3848.44]  That's what it means
[3848.44 --> 3849.16]  to be a part
[3849.16 --> 3850.02]  of a church family.
[3850.02 --> 3851.48]  I get to see it all the time,
[3851.56 --> 3852.54]  and it is a blessing
[3852.54 --> 3853.84]  because that is our calling,
[3853.96 --> 3856.14]  to live as community.
[3856.98 --> 3857.88]  Our calling is
[3857.88 --> 3859.24]  to sacrifice ourselves
[3859.24 --> 3860.44]  and live for others,
[3860.56 --> 3861.80]  to trade comfort
[3861.80 --> 3862.64]  for community.
[3862.80 --> 3863.92]  I see it happening here.
[3863.96 --> 3865.04]  I pray you do too.
[3865.28 --> 3866.48]  I pray that you see
[3866.48 --> 3867.38]  that happening here.
[3868.72 --> 3869.70]  If you don't,
[3869.72 --> 3870.90]  if you don't see it
[3870.90 --> 3871.58]  happening here,
[3872.88 --> 3874.16]  I'm going to gently suggest
[3874.16 --> 3875.24]  that maybe then,
[3875.44 --> 3875.74]  maybe,
[3876.10 --> 3876.98]  it's because you're not
[3876.98 --> 3877.54]  putting yourself
[3877.54 --> 3878.28]  in those positions
[3878.28 --> 3879.02]  because honestly,
[3879.10 --> 3879.66]  if you did,
[3880.32 --> 3881.54]  you'll see that it's
[3881.54 --> 3882.72]  happening all around you here.
[3883.68 --> 3884.68]  That's our calling.
[3886.04 --> 3887.28]  But then what's the cost?
[3889.06 --> 3889.90]  Well, in short,
[3890.42 --> 3891.22]  everything.
[3892.22 --> 3893.28]  It costs you.
[3893.42 --> 3894.36]  It costs your life.
[3895.08 --> 3896.42]  It cost Moses his life.
[3896.54 --> 3897.36]  It cost him his family.
[3897.74 --> 3898.62]  It cost him his palace.
[3898.82 --> 3899.60]  It cost him its wealth.
[3900.00 --> 3901.22]  It cost him his social status
[3901.22 --> 3902.02]  among the Egyptians.
[3902.46 --> 3903.68]  It cost him his social status
[3903.68 --> 3904.40]  among the Israelites
[3904.40 --> 3905.24]  for 40 years.
[3905.34 --> 3906.46]  It costs everything.
[3908.98 --> 3909.84]  Because we're not supposed
[3909.84 --> 3910.78]  to live for ourselves.
[3911.52 --> 3912.30]  That's the point.
[3914.04 --> 3915.10]  We live for Christ
[3915.10 --> 3917.82]  and for his people,
[3917.92 --> 3918.58]  for our neighbors,
[3918.70 --> 3919.60]  for our brothers and sisters
[3919.60 --> 3919.98]  in Christ,
[3920.04 --> 3920.60]  for the communities
[3920.60 --> 3921.48]  he places us in.
[3921.80 --> 3922.94]  That means our eyes,
[3923.02 --> 3923.88]  like Moses' is,
[3923.90 --> 3925.10]  need to be fixed on Jesus.
[3925.36 --> 3926.60]  We're to live in this world
[3926.60 --> 3928.88]  persevering for our Savior,
[3929.28 --> 3930.16]  running the race
[3930.16 --> 3930.82]  set before us,
[3930.82 --> 3932.40]  not with our eyes on a swivel,
[3932.60 --> 3933.74]  not looking around
[3933.74 --> 3934.42]  at the riches
[3934.42 --> 3935.28]  or the pleasures
[3935.28 --> 3936.44]  or the comforts
[3936.44 --> 3937.54]  that maybe we can attain
[3937.54 --> 3939.70]  if we veered off path
[3939.70 --> 3940.30]  a little while.
[3941.52 --> 3941.78]  No.
[3942.04 --> 3943.16]  We run this race
[3943.16 --> 3944.02]  with our eyes
[3944.02 --> 3946.04]  fixed on Jesus.
[3946.42 --> 3947.22]  And like Moses,
[3947.34 --> 3949.02]  we persevere in God's name.
[3949.44 --> 3950.22]  This race,
[3950.52 --> 3951.56]  it will push us.
[3952.28 --> 3953.10]  God will call us
[3953.10 --> 3953.62]  to do things
[3953.62 --> 3954.58]  we find uncomfortable
[3954.58 --> 3955.90]  or hard.
[3956.04 --> 3957.20]  Things will happen to us
[3957.20 --> 3957.92]  that hurt.
[3957.92 --> 3959.86]  But we are called
[3959.86 --> 3961.20]  to persevere.
[3962.66 --> 3963.86]  Remember verse 27
[3963.86 --> 3964.38]  of our text?
[3964.68 --> 3965.72]  Moses persevered
[3965.72 --> 3966.60]  because he saw
[3966.60 --> 3967.62]  who was invisible.
[3968.32 --> 3969.10]  He knew God.
[3969.38 --> 3970.66]  He knew God's plan
[3970.66 --> 3971.40]  for his people.
[3971.80 --> 3972.74]  He knew the promises
[3972.74 --> 3973.46]  of Yahweh.
[3973.74 --> 3975.16]  His eyes were set
[3975.16 --> 3976.96]  on God's salvation plan,
[3977.04 --> 3977.80]  on God's plan
[3977.80 --> 3979.06]  to save Israel
[3979.06 --> 3980.24]  from their captivity
[3980.24 --> 3981.28]  and bring them
[3981.28 --> 3981.96]  to salvation
[3981.96 --> 3982.90]  in the promised land.
[3983.84 --> 3984.70]  Now read with me
[3984.70 --> 3985.26]  verse 28
[3985.26 --> 3985.84]  of our text.
[3985.84 --> 3986.82]  By faith,
[3986.94 --> 3987.98]  he kept the Passover
[3987.98 --> 3989.22]  and the application
[3989.22 --> 3989.68]  of blood
[3989.68 --> 3990.74]  so that the destroyer
[3990.74 --> 3991.48]  of the firstborn
[3991.48 --> 3992.40]  would not touch
[3992.40 --> 3993.50]  the firstborn of Israel.
[3996.38 --> 3996.90]  Moses,
[3997.10 --> 3997.74]  knowing God
[3997.74 --> 3998.78]  and trusting in God's
[3998.78 --> 3999.60]  salvation plan
[3999.60 --> 4000.24]  for his people,
[4000.32 --> 4001.26]  he took refuge
[4001.26 --> 4002.32]  under the blood
[4002.32 --> 4003.38]  of the Lamb.
[4004.60 --> 4005.32]  He had faith
[4005.32 --> 4006.64]  in God's salvation plan.
[4007.58 --> 4008.86]  During that Passover night,
[4009.16 --> 4009.94]  God asked Moses
[4009.94 --> 4010.94]  and all of the Israelites
[4010.94 --> 4012.50]  to paint Lamb's blood
[4012.50 --> 4013.42]  on the doorposts
[4013.42 --> 4014.00]  of their homes.
[4014.00 --> 4015.86]  When they did that,
[4015.92 --> 4016.64]  the angel of death
[4016.64 --> 4017.88]  would pass by their houses
[4017.88 --> 4019.30]  and salvation for them
[4019.30 --> 4019.98]  would be assured.
[4020.70 --> 4022.08]  Moses took refuge
[4022.08 --> 4023.38]  under the blood
[4023.38 --> 4024.02]  of the Lamb
[4024.02 --> 4025.82]  and Hebrews credits him here.
[4027.30 --> 4029.00]  He credits that as faith.
[4029.86 --> 4031.00]  He could look to the blood
[4031.00 --> 4031.42]  of the Lamb
[4031.42 --> 4032.24]  on the doorposts
[4032.24 --> 4033.50]  and he knew he would be saved.
[4033.74 --> 4035.02]  He knew they would be saved.
[4036.16 --> 4037.18]  We are called
[4037.18 --> 4038.40]  to that same faith.
[4039.62 --> 4041.00]  We can know God.
[4041.10 --> 4042.60]  We can know Christ
[4042.60 --> 4043.68]  because of his word,
[4043.90 --> 4044.76]  because of his activity
[4044.76 --> 4045.30]  in this world.
[4045.58 --> 4047.16]  We can hear and read
[4047.16 --> 4048.56]  of his promises to us.
[4048.92 --> 4050.62]  We can take the same refuge now
[4050.62 --> 4051.70]  and look to the blood
[4051.70 --> 4052.22]  of the Lamb,
[4052.50 --> 4053.36]  the blood of Christ,
[4053.46 --> 4054.64]  and know that we are saved.
[4055.68 --> 4056.50]  Our salvation
[4056.50 --> 4057.66]  is assured
[4057.66 --> 4059.00]  because of the blood
[4059.00 --> 4059.46]  of Jesus.
[4060.64 --> 4061.96]  Jesus came into this world
[4061.96 --> 4062.88]  and he lived
[4062.88 --> 4063.90]  the perfect life
[4063.90 --> 4064.52]  that you and I
[4064.52 --> 4065.16]  failed to live
[4065.16 --> 4066.14]  and then he died
[4066.14 --> 4066.74]  a death
[4066.74 --> 4067.48]  that all of us
[4067.48 --> 4068.34]  deserve to die,
[4068.66 --> 4069.28]  but he did so
[4069.28 --> 4070.00]  in our place.
[4070.00 --> 4072.36]  The blood of the Lamb
[4072.36 --> 4072.98]  of God
[4072.98 --> 4074.36]  was shed for us
[4074.36 --> 4075.34]  and that is what
[4075.34 --> 4076.58]  we can fix our eyes on
[4076.58 --> 4078.14]  because three days later
[4078.14 --> 4079.64]  Jesus rises again
[4079.64 --> 4080.20]  from the grave
[4080.20 --> 4081.22]  defeating sin and death
[4081.22 --> 4081.58]  forever
[4081.58 --> 4082.90]  and winning victory
[4082.90 --> 4083.62]  over this world
[4083.62 --> 4084.66]  for all who believe.
[4085.22 --> 4086.36]  That is what our eyes
[4086.36 --> 4087.20]  should be fixed on.
[4087.92 --> 4089.18]  The blood of the Lamb.
[4090.50 --> 4091.24]  And when we fix
[4091.24 --> 4092.04]  our eyes on Jesus,
[4092.30 --> 4093.76]  when we fix our eyes
[4093.76 --> 4094.70]  on the promises
[4094.70 --> 4095.40]  of salvation
[4095.40 --> 4096.20]  granted to us,
[4096.30 --> 4097.02]  when we fix
[4097.02 --> 4098.66]  our eyes on Christ
[4098.66 --> 4099.76]  and all he has done
[4099.76 --> 4100.30]  for us,
[4101.00 --> 4101.94]  when we fix
[4101.94 --> 4102.96]  our eyes
[4102.96 --> 4104.30]  on him,
[4105.74 --> 4107.46]  we can know
[4107.46 --> 4108.68]  we are following
[4108.68 --> 4109.88]  in the footsteps
[4109.88 --> 4111.86]  of the faithful people
[4111.86 --> 4113.00]  who have gone before us
[4113.00 --> 4114.10]  and we will be joining
[4114.10 --> 4115.22]  a cloud of witnesses
[4115.22 --> 4116.50]  who have done the same.
[4117.44 --> 4118.28]  Faithful footsteps
[4118.28 --> 4118.98]  like Moses.
[4120.92 --> 4121.96]  What are your eyes
[4121.96 --> 4123.42]  fixed on today?
[4124.88 --> 4126.32]  Where do you find
[4126.32 --> 4127.00]  refuge?
[4127.00 --> 4132.06]  When I think of someone
[4132.06 --> 4132.70]  in my life
[4132.70 --> 4133.48]  who's persevered
[4133.48 --> 4134.98]  for faith in this world,
[4135.04 --> 4135.70]  my mind immediately
[4135.70 --> 4136.50]  goes to my grandma.
[4136.68 --> 4138.16]  My grandma Van Wauveren
[4138.16 --> 4139.66]  was my mom's mom.
[4140.54 --> 4141.42]  Her and my gramps
[4141.42 --> 4142.00]  actually lived
[4142.00 --> 4142.78]  in the basement suite
[4142.78 --> 4143.72]  of my house growing up,
[4143.78 --> 4145.10]  so I got to visit with them
[4145.10 --> 4146.52]  and see them a lot.
[4147.06 --> 4148.10]  But hearing her story,
[4148.34 --> 4149.82]  watching her live her life
[4149.82 --> 4150.92]  with all she had
[4150.92 --> 4151.84]  to persevere through,
[4152.06 --> 4153.16]  it had a tremendous
[4153.16 --> 4154.42]  influence on my life.
[4154.92 --> 4155.42]  See, my grandma,
[4155.42 --> 4157.22]  like most people my age
[4157.22 --> 4157.80]  whose grandmas
[4157.80 --> 4158.62]  and grandpas did this,
[4158.68 --> 4159.20]  she lived through
[4159.20 --> 4159.88]  World War II.
[4160.78 --> 4161.62]  Her parents owned
[4161.62 --> 4162.84]  a greenhouse in Holland
[4162.84 --> 4164.44]  and when she was 12 years old,
[4164.50 --> 4165.28]  the war began.
[4166.08 --> 4169.78]  To protect those people
[4169.78 --> 4170.48]  in her family
[4170.48 --> 4171.24]  who they loved,
[4171.40 --> 4173.42]  her job was to keep a lookout
[4173.42 --> 4174.52]  for the German soldiers
[4174.52 --> 4175.50]  and whenever they
[4175.50 --> 4176.34]  approached the house,
[4176.42 --> 4177.04]  she would have to turn
[4177.04 --> 4177.70]  the radio on
[4177.70 --> 4178.18]  in the greenhouse
[4178.18 --> 4179.56]  and when the radio came on,
[4179.96 --> 4180.88]  the people that they loved
[4180.88 --> 4181.66]  could go and hide
[4181.66 --> 4182.66]  and be safe that way.
[4182.66 --> 4183.42]  That was her job
[4183.42 --> 4184.44]  as a 12-year-old girl.
[4186.14 --> 4187.08]  Persevering through a war
[4187.08 --> 4187.66]  as a teenager
[4187.66 --> 4188.34]  was tough enough
[4188.34 --> 4189.18]  but for my grandma,
[4189.62 --> 4190.48]  that was just the beginning
[4190.48 --> 4191.72]  of the trials in her life.
[4192.10 --> 4192.82]  She moved to Canada
[4192.82 --> 4193.64]  in 1949
[4193.64 --> 4194.46]  and later that year
[4194.46 --> 4195.02]  she got married
[4195.02 --> 4195.90]  to a man named Peter.
[4196.24 --> 4197.68]  They had four daughters together,
[4197.90 --> 4199.42]  Mary, Patricia, Wilma, and Jane.
[4199.54 --> 4200.04]  Four daughters.
[4200.58 --> 4201.36]  That's perseverance.
[4203.04 --> 4203.42]  No, I'm kidding.
[4206.46 --> 4207.14]  Tragically though,
[4207.56 --> 4208.62]  when my Aunt Jane,
[4208.70 --> 4209.50]  the youngest of the four,
[4209.54 --> 4210.86]  was only a few months old,
[4210.86 --> 4211.98]  her husband Peter,
[4212.24 --> 4213.34]  was hit by a train
[4213.34 --> 4214.62]  and passed away instantly.
[4215.68 --> 4216.84]  My grandma was not even
[4216.84 --> 4217.62]  30 years old
[4217.62 --> 4218.82]  and she was widowed
[4218.82 --> 4221.00]  with four young girls.
[4221.84 --> 4222.76]  Three years later though,
[4222.82 --> 4223.50]  she married again.
[4224.06 --> 4224.90]  She married another man,
[4224.96 --> 4225.60]  someone she had known
[4225.60 --> 4226.12]  growing up.
[4226.16 --> 4226.94]  His name was William.
[4227.14 --> 4228.06]  He had also immigrated
[4228.06 --> 4228.56]  to Canada
[4228.56 --> 4230.28]  and they had a daughter
[4230.28 --> 4230.94]  themselves too.
[4231.02 --> 4231.66]  They named her Helen.
[4231.82 --> 4232.52]  That's my mom.
[4233.92 --> 4234.98]  Over the next 12 years,
[4235.08 --> 4235.92]  their greenhouse business
[4235.92 --> 4236.54]  kind of grew
[4236.54 --> 4237.36]  and they saw the birth
[4237.36 --> 4238.72]  of their first two grandchildren
[4238.72 --> 4239.84]  but sadly,
[4239.96 --> 4240.94]  when my mom was 12
[4240.94 --> 4241.70]  and my grandma
[4241.70 --> 4243.34]  was only 45 years old,
[4243.44 --> 4244.64]  William suffered
[4244.64 --> 4245.66]  a massive heart attack
[4245.66 --> 4246.80]  and he died as well.
[4247.70 --> 4248.88]  So for the second time
[4248.88 --> 4249.80]  in her young life,
[4249.90 --> 4250.78]  my grandma was widowed,
[4250.88 --> 4252.38]  this time with five children.
[4253.82 --> 4255.02]  The next eight years,
[4255.12 --> 4256.20]  they managed life okay
[4256.20 --> 4256.98]  in Ontario
[4256.98 --> 4258.42]  and in 1981,
[4258.86 --> 4259.66]  my grandma actually
[4259.66 --> 4260.44]  ended up moving back
[4260.44 --> 4260.86]  to Holland.
[4261.04 --> 4262.48]  She re-emigrated.
[4262.60 --> 4263.06]  Emigrated,
[4263.16 --> 4263.72]  she went back.
[4263.96 --> 4265.64]  She redid life over again
[4265.64 --> 4267.40]  and she married a man
[4267.40 --> 4268.48]  again that she had known
[4268.48 --> 4269.30]  in her life in Holland
[4269.30 --> 4270.08]  named Matthijs.
[4271.02 --> 4271.96]  She married him
[4271.96 --> 4272.94]  and they settled down
[4272.94 --> 4273.84]  in Holland.
[4274.00 --> 4274.74]  In 1985,
[4275.18 --> 4275.88]  in what I assume
[4275.88 --> 4276.82]  was the greatest moment
[4276.82 --> 4277.32]  of her life,
[4277.38 --> 4278.90]  her 10th grandchild
[4278.90 --> 4279.54]  was born.
[4280.10 --> 4280.82]  He ended up being
[4280.82 --> 4281.76]  the 10th of 19,
[4281.94 --> 4282.46]  so some would say
[4282.46 --> 4283.76]  the peak of the grandchildren.
[4285.46 --> 4287.44]  The mountaintop experience
[4287.44 --> 4288.40]  of grandchildren.
[4289.58 --> 4290.28]  It was me.
[4290.36 --> 4291.36]  I was the grandchild
[4291.36 --> 4292.00]  that was born.
[4292.50 --> 4293.42]  If we didn't know.
[4293.42 --> 4297.10]  But death kept rearing
[4297.10 --> 4298.52]  its head in our family.
[4298.64 --> 4300.08]  A year after I was born,
[4300.24 --> 4300.78]  my cousin,
[4300.94 --> 4302.00]  who was 12 at the time,
[4302.08 --> 4302.64]  passed away
[4302.64 --> 4304.88]  in a freak farm accident
[4304.88 --> 4305.98]  in Ontario.
[4307.06 --> 4308.02]  In 1993,
[4308.12 --> 4308.84]  my grandma moved back
[4308.84 --> 4309.28]  to Canada,
[4309.42 --> 4310.66]  immigrating for the second time
[4310.66 --> 4311.16]  in her life,
[4311.22 --> 4312.78]  this time with my now gramps,
[4312.88 --> 4314.20]  who I learned to know
[4314.20 --> 4314.90]  and love, of course,
[4314.96 --> 4316.10]  the only grandfather I knew,
[4316.32 --> 4317.28]  but it was his first time,
[4317.58 --> 4318.26]  so she had to do
[4318.26 --> 4319.24]  all of that over again
[4319.24 --> 4320.12]  with her husband.
[4320.12 --> 4323.78]  They moved into
[4323.78 --> 4324.42]  the basement suite
[4324.42 --> 4325.24]  that I lived in
[4325.24 --> 4326.06]  and I got to grow up
[4326.06 --> 4327.60]  with them nearby.
[4327.80 --> 4328.90]  However, later that year,
[4329.00 --> 4329.70]  a few months after
[4329.70 --> 4330.32]  they immigrated,
[4330.42 --> 4331.42]  another of my cousins
[4331.42 --> 4332.16]  passed away.
[4333.58 --> 4334.84]  Janelle was only alive
[4334.84 --> 4335.60]  for a few months
[4335.60 --> 4336.32]  when she died.
[4337.76 --> 4338.72]  Six years later,
[4339.26 --> 4340.20]  death keeps appearing.
[4340.40 --> 4341.76]  My grandma's oldest daughter,
[4341.94 --> 4342.26]  Mary,
[4343.38 --> 4344.66]  my mom's oldest sister,
[4344.80 --> 4345.56]  suddenly passed away.
[4346.02 --> 4346.86]  She went to bed healthy,
[4347.48 --> 4348.64]  had an aortic dissection,
[4348.76 --> 4349.14]  it's called,
[4349.14 --> 4349.98]  never woke up.
[4350.22 --> 4351.44]  She had five kids herself,
[4351.92 --> 4354.18]  they were 13 to 25 at the time,
[4354.64 --> 4355.68]  and my grandma had now
[4355.68 --> 4357.62]  lost her oldest daughter as well.
[4358.42 --> 4359.54]  Five years after that,
[4359.60 --> 4360.22]  after being married
[4360.22 --> 4361.08]  for 23 years,
[4361.18 --> 4362.66]  my gramps also passed away
[4362.66 --> 4364.08]  from complications with cancer,
[4364.20 --> 4364.82]  widowing my grandma
[4364.82 --> 4366.14]  for a third time in her life.
[4367.62 --> 4369.12]  She lived for five more years
[4369.12 --> 4369.72]  at that point.
[4370.44 --> 4371.20]  She moved actually
[4371.20 --> 4371.94]  from where we lived
[4371.94 --> 4372.96]  on the island to Alberta
[4372.96 --> 4374.42]  and finally went home
[4374.42 --> 4375.00]  to the Lord
[4375.00 --> 4377.28]  at the age of 82 in 2009.
[4377.46 --> 4378.48]  So through all of this,
[4379.14 --> 4380.20]  through World War II,
[4380.84 --> 4381.98]  through all of the immigration
[4381.98 --> 4382.78]  back and forth,
[4383.06 --> 4383.86]  through the struggles
[4383.86 --> 4384.80]  of single parenting
[4384.80 --> 4385.68]  at different points
[4385.68 --> 4386.28]  in her life,
[4386.78 --> 4387.86]  from moving to Holland
[4387.86 --> 4388.54]  to Ontario,
[4388.66 --> 4389.26]  back to Holland
[4389.26 --> 4390.52]  to BC and then Alberta,
[4391.04 --> 4392.82]  oftentimes unmarried,
[4393.70 --> 4394.28]  through a life
[4394.28 --> 4394.86]  where she outlived
[4394.86 --> 4395.52]  three husbands,
[4395.78 --> 4396.38]  one child,
[4396.52 --> 4397.26]  three grandchildren,
[4397.48 --> 4398.20]  and almost all
[4398.20 --> 4398.80]  of her siblings,
[4400.22 --> 4401.90]  my grandma never lost the faith.
[4401.90 --> 4404.06]  Now, I wasn't around
[4404.06 --> 4404.68]  for the first number
[4404.68 --> 4405.62]  of people who passed away
[4405.62 --> 4406.26]  in her life,
[4406.32 --> 4406.90]  but I was around
[4406.90 --> 4408.12]  for the second handful
[4408.12 --> 4408.92]  and every time we got
[4408.92 --> 4410.34]  together as a family
[4410.34 --> 4411.24]  to grieve the loss
[4411.24 --> 4412.26]  of another loved one,
[4413.06 --> 4413.84]  my grandma grieved,
[4413.98 --> 4414.32]  of course,
[4414.78 --> 4417.00]  but she also held out hope.
[4417.68 --> 4419.08]  She was always a beacon
[4419.08 --> 4420.18]  of hope and perseverance.
[4420.38 --> 4421.14]  She knew the Lord.
[4421.54 --> 4422.16]  She knew what it meant
[4422.16 --> 4423.72]  to persevere in her faith.
[4424.74 --> 4426.08]  She became a rock
[4426.08 --> 4427.84]  on which our family stood
[4427.84 --> 4429.24]  and yet she always pointed
[4429.24 --> 4430.18]  to the rock,
[4430.54 --> 4431.18]  the rock,
[4431.32 --> 4432.44]  her Savior, Jesus Christ,
[4432.52 --> 4433.24]  the foundation
[4433.24 --> 4435.04]  on which she placed her faith.
[4436.32 --> 4437.62]  She knew that no matter what,
[4437.70 --> 4438.78]  all faith could be found
[4438.78 --> 4439.24]  in Jesus,
[4440.24 --> 4442.68]  no matter what trials
[4442.68 --> 4443.44]  were thrown her way.
[4444.44 --> 4445.86]  And so she kept her eyes
[4445.86 --> 4446.70]  on Christ,
[4447.46 --> 4449.30]  no matter what was happening.
[4449.78 --> 4450.48]  She never missed
[4450.48 --> 4451.16]  a church service.
[4451.44 --> 4452.64]  She prayed continuously.
[4452.82 --> 4454.06]  She kept her Bible close.
[4454.50 --> 4455.66]  She sang in the choir
[4455.66 --> 4456.40]  all her life.
[4456.88 --> 4457.70]  And even if there was
[4457.70 --> 4458.76]  tears in her eyes,
[4459.10 --> 4460.12]  she did this with a smile
[4460.12 --> 4460.78]  on her face,
[4461.02 --> 4462.04]  with a faith that was
[4462.04 --> 4463.02]  grounded in Jesus
[4463.02 --> 4464.36]  and with jelly beans
[4464.36 --> 4465.58]  on her living room table
[4465.58 --> 4466.58]  for all of her grandkids.
[4468.58 --> 4469.78]  That's my example
[4469.78 --> 4471.62]  of someone who persevered
[4471.62 --> 4472.22]  in the faith,
[4472.80 --> 4474.82]  no matter the cost.
[4476.38 --> 4477.46]  And so I ask you this,
[4478.20 --> 4479.48]  who is your example?
[4480.34 --> 4481.98]  Who is your faith hero
[4481.98 --> 4483.22]  who lived out this kind
[4483.22 --> 4484.56]  of perseverance in your life?
[4484.90 --> 4486.68]  Who has their eyes fixed
[4486.68 --> 4487.68]  on Jesus,
[4487.88 --> 4488.86]  no matter the calling,
[4489.28 --> 4490.34]  no matter the cost?
[4491.76 --> 4492.48]  And then,
[4492.90 --> 4493.70]  for us all,
[4493.84 --> 4494.36]  what if we were
[4494.36 --> 4495.22]  a little more like that?
[4496.16 --> 4496.88]  What if we were
[4496.88 --> 4498.06]  a little bit more like Moses?
[4498.32 --> 4498.82]  What if we were
[4498.82 --> 4499.58]  a little bit more
[4499.58 --> 4500.26]  like my grandma?
[4500.42 --> 4501.08]  What would happen
[4501.08 --> 4502.00]  if we persevered
[4502.00 --> 4502.74]  and saw Jesus
[4502.74 --> 4504.54]  in all areas of our life,
[4504.66 --> 4505.70]  the good and the bad?
[4506.96 --> 4507.78]  What would happen
[4507.78 --> 4508.48]  to our families?
[4508.72 --> 4509.22]  What would happen
[4509.22 --> 4509.94]  to this church?
[4510.02 --> 4510.50]  What would happen
[4510.50 --> 4511.22]  to our community?
[4511.22 --> 4513.56]  What would happen
[4513.56 --> 4515.88]  if no matter the cost,
[4516.62 --> 4519.44]  if you fixed your eyes
[4519.44 --> 4520.02]  on Jesus,
[4520.98 --> 4522.32]  lived out his calling
[4522.32 --> 4523.06]  in this world,
[4523.74 --> 4524.96]  and persevered
[4524.96 --> 4525.64]  for the faith?
[4526.60 --> 4527.64]  What would happen?
[4529.04 --> 4529.36]  Amen.
[4529.60 --> 4530.08]  Let me pray.
[4530.08 --> 4537.54]  Father God,
[4537.62 --> 4540.22]  we hear stories
[4540.22 --> 4541.70]  like Moses.
[4542.98 --> 4544.92]  We hear stories
[4544.92 --> 4546.32]  of people persevering
[4546.32 --> 4547.38]  through hardships,
[4547.68 --> 4548.98]  going from riches
[4548.98 --> 4549.78]  to rags,
[4550.02 --> 4551.10]  losing people,
[4551.28 --> 4554.46]  losing people they love,
[4555.12 --> 4556.32]  places they love.
[4557.32 --> 4558.40]  Lord, having things
[4558.40 --> 4559.40]  happened in their life
[4559.40 --> 4562.78]  that can tear you down,
[4563.56 --> 4564.78]  and yet we hear stories
[4564.78 --> 4565.56]  of these people
[4565.56 --> 4567.82]  pressing forward,
[4568.56 --> 4569.60]  persevering for your
[4569.60 --> 4570.42]  gospel truth,
[4571.30 --> 4571.88]  and knowing
[4571.88 --> 4573.78]  that they can be secure
[4573.78 --> 4575.22]  in who they are
[4575.22 --> 4576.26]  because you are
[4576.26 --> 4577.32]  who you say you are,
[4578.26 --> 4579.38]  that you sent your son
[4579.38 --> 4580.34]  to save us all,
[4580.84 --> 4581.76]  and that that salvation
[4581.76 --> 4583.14]  is assured for all of us.
[4584.46 --> 4585.50]  Lord, may that
[4585.50 --> 4587.46]  giant G gospel
[4587.46 --> 4588.02]  reign true
[4588.02 --> 4588.66]  in our hearts
[4588.66 --> 4589.74]  so that we,
[4590.72 --> 4591.94]  no matter what happens,
[4592.06 --> 4593.06]  no matter the cost,
[4593.68 --> 4594.58]  no matter how we are
[4594.58 --> 4595.36]  called to live out
[4595.36 --> 4596.52]  this calling of love
[4596.52 --> 4597.28]  in the world,
[4599.42 --> 4600.54]  God, may we continue
[4600.54 --> 4603.10]  to keep our eyes
[4603.10 --> 4603.80]  fixed on you
[4603.80 --> 4606.32]  and strive
[4606.32 --> 4607.14]  to become
[4607.14 --> 4608.08]  more like you.
[4609.18 --> 4609.98]  May we leave
[4609.98 --> 4610.90]  this place today
[4610.90 --> 4612.74]  doing just that.
[4612.84 --> 4613.38]  May you place
[4613.38 --> 4613.96]  on our hearts
[4613.96 --> 4614.86]  people in our lives
[4614.86 --> 4615.50]  who have exuded
[4615.50 --> 4616.36]  this perseverance
[4616.36 --> 4617.04]  of faith,
[4617.72 --> 4618.78]  and may we
[4618.78 --> 4620.30]  share those stories.
[4623.40 --> 4624.24]  God, may we all
[4624.24 --> 4625.02]  draw closer to you
[4625.02 --> 4625.40]  through that.
[4625.62 --> 4626.00]  In your name,
[4626.78 --> 4626.96]  amen.
[4626.96 --> 4627.06]  Amen.
[4632.46 --> 4633.52]  Please stand and sing.
[4633.52 --> 4663.20]  Starting in wam
[4663.20 --> 4665.88]  is Christ.
[4666.54 --> 4667.60]  Hallelujah.
[4671.54 --> 4675.14]  Jesus is my
[4675.14 --> 4676.92]  love.
[4678.60 --> 4681.58]  I once was lost
[4681.58 --> 4685.32]  in darkest night, yet thought I
[4685.32 --> 4688.64]  knew the way.
[4688.64 --> 4692.52]  The sin I promised, joy
[4692.52 --> 4695.18]  and life, can led me
[4695.18 --> 4698.56]  to the grave.
[4698.90 --> 4701.10]  I had no hope
[4701.10 --> 4703.48]  that you alone
[4703.48 --> 4705.96]  are able to
[4705.96 --> 4708.42]  your wealth.
[4708.86 --> 4711.00]  And if you had
[4711.00 --> 4713.48]  come on me first,
[4713.48 --> 4715.98]  I would refuse
[4715.98 --> 4718.48]  you still.
[4722.52 --> 4729.74]  But as I ran, I held
[4729.74 --> 4733.18]  a grace, indifferent to
[4733.18 --> 4735.72]  the cost.
[4736.10 --> 4739.52]  You would deny my health
[4739.52 --> 4742.98]  the state, and led me to
[4742.98 --> 4745.48]  the cost.
[4745.48 --> 4748.14]  And I beheld
[4748.14 --> 4750.44]  God's love to save.
[4750.44 --> 4751.80]  You suffered
[4751.80 --> 4755.52]  in my place.
[4755.52 --> 4757.86]  You bore the wrath,
[4758.32 --> 4760.34]  he served for me.
[4760.70 --> 4762.48]  Now all I know
[4762.48 --> 4765.48]  is praise.
[4765.48 --> 4769.40]  Hose him for the cold米.
[4769.46 --> 4770.46]  All he has
[4770.58 --> 4791.02]  in my KIM
[4791.02 --> 4799.72]  But I would be yours alone, soon as the all might see.
[4799.72 --> 4809.48]  The strength to follow your commands would never come from me.
[4809.48 --> 4819.24]  Oh, Father, you might not reply in any way you choose.
[4819.24 --> 4828.78]  And let my song forever be my only love, Savior.
[4829.98 --> 4841.28]  Hallelujah, all I have is Christ.
[4841.28 --> 4850.98]  Hallelujah, Jesus is my life.
[4850.98 --> 4860.40]  Hallelujah, all I have is Christ.
[4860.86 --> 4870.38]  Hallelujah, Jesus is my life.
[4871.28 --> 4883.40]  Hallelujah, all I have is Christ.
[4883.40 --> 4895.58]  Hallelujah, Jesus is my life.
[4895.58 --> 4897.58]  Amen.
[4897.58 --> 4898.58]  Amen.
[4898.58 --> 4898.98]  Amen.
[4898.98 --> 4899.22]  Amen.
[4899.22 --> 4899.58]  Amen.
[4899.58 --> 4901.34]  Amen.
[4901.34 --> 4905.22]  I invite you all after the service to join us for some fellowship in the foyer afterwards.
[4905.22 --> 4909.70]  If you're in need of prayer today, there will be prayer people available with yellow name
[4909.70 --> 4914.94]  on, so please seek them out if you are in need of that. Before we go, we're going to sing one more
[4914.94 --> 4919.92]  song, but I invite you to hear God's blessing, his parting blessing this morning from Numbers
[4919.92 --> 4927.50]  chapter 6, where it says, the Lord bless you and keep you. The Lord make his face shine upon you
[4927.50 --> 4935.30]  and be gracious to you. The Lord turn his face toward you and give you his peace. And all God's
[4935.30 --> 4935.80]  people said.
[4940.80 --> 4962.76]  Should nothing of our effort stand, no legacy survive, unless the Lord does raise the house
[4962.76 --> 4982.64]  in vain its builders strive. To you who boast tomorrow's game, tell me what is your life?
[4982.64 --> 4996.14]  A mist that banishes at dawn, all glory be to Christ.
[4996.14 --> 5023.94]  All glory be to Christ the King. All glory be to Christ. His rule and reign will ever sing. All glory be to Christ.
[5023.94 --> 5045.94]  His will be done, His kingdom come on earth as is above. Who is His self-artigating? Praise Him, the Lord of God.
[5045.94 --> 5047.94]  His will, His tomb and reign will ever sing. The living heart of the eye. A filling heart of the eye.
[5047.94 --> 5063.74]  The filling heart of Thee satisfied, the thirsty with of the pride. We'll take a nap on high and sin. All glory be to God.
[5063.74 --> 5081.74]  All glory need to God's love, all glory need to God. His love and grace will ever sing, all glory need to God.
[5081.74 --> 5100.74]  When all my name are great, I am the faithful and the true, the Lamb who was forsaken, slain his way of Jesus.
[5100.74 --> 5117.74]  To hold our God shall live with us, and be to our steadfast life, and we shall let his people be, O glory be to Christ.
[5117.74 --> 5141.18]  All glory be to Christ our King, all glory be to Christ our King, all glory be to Christ our King.
[5141.18 --> 5146.18]  All glory be to Christ our King, all glory be to Christ our King.
[5146.18 --> 5159.18]  His rule and reign will ever sing, all glory be to Christ our King.
[5171.18 --> 5174.18]  Thanks again to your love and bye.
