• Suffering with Christ is necessary to share in His glory
• Receiving the Spirit gives identity as a child of God, not a slave to fear
• The Spirit brings adoption to sonship and intimacy with God (Abba)
• Christians are invited to approach God in love and affection, rather than just as Creator.
• Calling God "papa" or "daddy" is being invited to experience intimacy with God
• Some people worry that using such language shows irreverence, but it's about experiencing relationship with God
• Intimacy and respect are not mutually exclusive; both can be held together in worship of God
• For those who have negative relationships with earthly fathers, a heavenly father offers love and acceptance

• The concept of men and women being both sons/daughters of God
• Paul's statement in Galatians 3 that there is no longer male or female in Christ Jesus
• The idea that the Spirit granting new life makes us cry out "Abba" (Father) as a unified family
• The significance of the gospel in raising the status of women to an unprecedented level in its cultural moment
• Those who may inherit the kingdom of God
• We are all sons and children of God
• There is no condemnation for us
• Our minds should be set on what the Spirit desires
• Putting to death sin in our lives
• The verse in question offers no condemnation for those who have sinned
• There is a false notion that one's sin is worse than others'
• This can lead to fear of judgment and death, but the truth is God loves all people equally
• Consequences may still occur due to actions, but there is no ultimate damnation or separation from God
• Adoption as sons and heirs with Christ brings freedom from condemnation
• The burden of needing to prove oneself to God

• Being a son of Christ means having one's mind captivated by the things of God
• Focus on God's goodness leads to greater impact in the world
• Attitude of the mind is key, focusing on what you truly love
• What occupies your mind shapes your life
• Worship as attention: what are you giving your attention to?
• The Spirit is life and peace, and being captivated by the Spirit brings attention to God's will.
• Mortification of the body's misdeeds through the Spirit leads to life.
• The concept of mortification is described as putting sin to death in one's life.
• Verse 12-13 explain that living according to the flesh results in death, but putting sin to death through the Spirit brings life.
• Mortification means total and complete destruction of the body's sinful deeds.
• Mortification of sin is a process that requires complete surrender to God's power
• It's not about resisting sinful behavior or keeping it under control, but about getting as far away from it as possible
• Mortification remembers the gospel and applies its truth that by grace through faith we have died with Christ and been raised with him in newness of life
• The process goes deeper than just resisting sinful behavior and involves remembering our identity in Christ and living according to the gospel
• The power of Christ's resurrection and the life-giving spirit
• Mortifying sin and putting it to death
• The nature of Christian living: dying to the old and living out the new
