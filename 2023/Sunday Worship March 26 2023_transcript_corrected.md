[435.06 → 437.14] You just have to give them.
[437.74 → 438.74] Throughout the month of April,
[438.74 → 439.74] throughout the month of April,
[439.92 → 443.00] we play a game called Treat Tech.
[443.06 → 445.94] In this game, you have a chance to bless someone you know
[445.94 → 449.52] or someone you don't with some candy or some candy
[449.52 → 451.40] or a card, a note of encouragement,
[451.56 → 455.66] anything you can think of that would make someone else
[455.66 → 456.68] feel better about their day.
[456.68 → 460.10] And remember, in Treat, Tag, Tag, Tag, Tag,
[460.10 → 461.18] Tag, Tag, people you know,
[461.18 → 464.48] but also Tag, people you don't yet know.
[464.48 → 468.82] And if you get tagged, go ahead and tag one, two, five,
[468.82 → 474.60] or ten other people so that the game can just keep on rolling
[474.60 → 476.08] through the community.
[476.30 → 479.16] Below this video or in our weekly,
[479.16 → 484.62] you will find a link to a card that you can use
[484.62 → 488.04] when you give Treat, Tag, so that they can understand
[488.04 → 490.00] what is next.
[490.08 → 492.96] Don't forget to post it on social media
[492.96 → 496.18] as we go through so that everyone can see this game
[496.18 → 498.32] happening in front of them.
[498.32 → 502.24] And lastly, don't wait to be tagged.
[502.24 → 505.22] Go ahead and start tagging.
[505.22 → 508.64] Speaking of which, Treat Tag is now, let's get going.

[566.96 → 571.52] And I'm grateful you are here worshipping with us today.
[572.08 → 575.20] As you saw, Treat Tag starts in April.
[575.20 → 578.88] And we're going to continue running with that.
[579.92 → 585.16] But there will be more information in the e-bulletin or the midweek memo coming this week.
[585.24 → 590.98] If you don't receive the e-bulletin or the midweek memo, connect with the office.

[593.84 → 600.28] Or email communications at licrc.ca, and you will get all that information.
[600.62 → 604.72] As we worship today, we've got a couple announcements to start us off.
[604.72 → 607.54] And so I'm going to invite Kevin and Josh up to the front.
[608.26 → 610.58] And they will, in turn, give their announcements.

[626.58 → 628.08] It's going to be very exciting.
[628.54 → 631.54] We are looking for a couple more ladies to join the team.
[631.54 → 638.08] So if you are interested in playing slow pitch, and you are a lady, come chat with me after the service.
[638.26 → 641.50] And you can be wearing this hat along with everyone else.
[642.24 → 642.52] Thanks.

[706.62 → 709.54] Some of our more senior members live there.
[709.88 → 714.46] And the beginning of every month, the first Saturday of every month, a group goes, and we worship with them there.
[714.88 → 725.36] We just wanted to invite you and to come out and to join with us and with them as we worship together and as we lead in worship there.

[752.96 → 756.48] And so receive his greeting.
[757.82 → 767.92] Grace, mercy, from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son and our Saviour, through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[767.92 → 769.48] Amen.
[770.20 → 772.36] I'm going to invite you to turn to those around you.

[800.36 → 802.24] Amen.
[806.24 → 808.42] Good morning and welcome to worship today.
[809.14 → 811.22] Our call to worship is from Psalm 95.
[812.38 → 815.00] Come, let us sing for joy to the Lord.
[815.28 → 817.78] Let us shout aloud to the rock of our salvation.
[818.50 → 822.88] Let us come before him with Thanksgiving and extol him with music and song.
[823.62 → 827.42] For the Lord is the great God, the great King above all gods.
[827.92 → 831.60] In his hands are the depths of the earth, and the mountain peaks belong to him.
[832.14 → 835.92] The sea is his, for he made it, and his hands formed the dry land.
[836.50 → 838.34] Come, let us bow down in worship.
[838.58 → 842.10] Let us kneel before the Lord our Maker, for he is our God,
[842.18 → 846.06] and we are the people of his pasture, the flock under his care.
[847.78 → 851.24] Church of Christ, what do you believe when you say,
[851.94 → 855.96] I believe in God the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth?
[857.42 → 860.98] Every time the Father of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[861.56 → 866.00] who out of nothing created heaven and earth and everything in them,
[866.70 → 871.72] who still upholds and rules them by his eternal counsel and providence,
[871.96 → 876.08] is my God and Father because of Christ the Son.
[876.96 → 884.82] I trust God so much that I do not doubt he will provide whatever I need for body and soul
[884.82 → 891.72] and will turn to my good whatever adversity he sends upon me in this sad world.
[892.74 → 896.72] God is able to do this because he is Almighty God
[896.72 → 901.28] and desires to do this because he is a faithful Father.
[901.28 → 930.88] God is ability to pray for fair Hawai'i before Katie,
[930.88 → 950.88] Holy, Lord God Almighty, early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee.
[950.88 → 973.90] Holy, Holy, Holy, merciful and mighty, God in three blessings, blessed Trinity.
[973.90 → 999.16] Holy, Holy, Holy, all the saints adore Thee, casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea.
[999.16 → 1023.16] Cherubim and seraphim falling down before Thee, who would and ought and evermore shall be.
[1023.16 → 1048.16] Holy, Holy, Holy, though the darkness hide Thee, though the eye may blind by sin, Thy glory may not see.
[1048.16 → 1071.04] Holy, Holy, thou art holy, there is none beside Thee, perfect environment, love and purity.
[1071.04 → 1096.04] Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty, all Thy words shall praise Thy name in earth and sky and sea.
[1096.04 → 1120.34] Holy, Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty, God in three persons, blessed Trinity.
[1126.04 → 1135.44] Son of the Holy, Holy,
[1140.58 → 1146.84] He e'era and sons of in one this mess.
[1146.84 → 1155.42] Come all you sinners, come all you thirsty
[1155.42 → 1160.00] Come to the well that never runs dry
[1160.00 → 1165.68] Drink of His water, come and thirst no more
[1165.68 → 1173.38] Come all you sinners, come find His mercy
[1173.38 → 1177.42] Come to the table, He will satisfy
[1177.42 → 1183.22] Taste of His goodness, find what you're looking for
[1183.22 → 1191.34] For God so loved, the world that He gave us
[1191.34 → 1195.94] His one and only Son to save us
[1195.94 → 1201.00] Whoever believes in Him will live forever
[1201.00 → 1209.34] Bring all your failures, bring your addictions
[1209.34 → 1213.70] Come lay them down at the foot of the cross
[1213.70 → 1219.04] Jesus is waiting there with open arms
[1219.04 → 1227.38] For God so loved, the world that He gave us
[1227.38 → 1232.04] His one and only Son to save us
[1232.04 → 1237.08] Whoever believes in Him will live forever
[1237.08 → 1245.42] The power of hell, forever defeated
[1245.42 → 1249.82] Now it is well, I'm walking on freedom
[1249.82 → 1255.42] For God so loved, God so loved the world
[1255.42 → 1265.76] Praise God, praise God, from whom all blessings flow
[1265.76 → 1275.76] Praise Him, praise Him, for the wonders of His love
[1275.76 → 1289.76] For God so loved, the world that He gave us
[1289.76 → 1294.10] For the wonders of His love
[1294.10 → 1301.10] For God so loved, the world that He gave us
[1301.10 → 1306.22] His one and only Son to save us
[1306.22 → 1310.10] For God so loved, the world that He gave us
[1310.10 → 1311.10] His one and only Son to save us
[1311.10 → 1315.10] His one and only Son to save us
[1315.10 → 1320.10] Whoever believed in Him will live forever
[1320.10 → 1327.10] The power of hell, forever defeated
[1327.10 → 1332.44] Now it is well, I'm walking on freedom
[1332.44 → 1337.44] For God so loved, God so loved the world
[1337.44 → 1345.44] Bring all your failures, bring your addictions
[1345.44 → 1349.44] Come lay them down at the foot of the cross
[1349.44 → 1355.44] Jesus is waiting, God so loved the world
[1355.44 → 1356.44] The world
[1356.44 → 1358.44] The world
[1358.44 → 1360.44] The world
[1360.44 → 1373.94] The world
[1373.94 → 1376.30] The world
[1376.30 → 1377.44] Tongue
[1377.44 → 1385.44] Phantom
[1385.44 → 1387.44] tactile
[1387.44 → 1402.48] Turn your eyes upon Jesus
[1402.48 → 1410.32] Look full in his wonderful face
[1410.32 → 1418.82] And the things of earth take their rightful place
[1418.82 → 1426.08] In the light of his glory and grace
[1428.58 → 1430.96] O soul, are you weary and troubled?
[1431.56 → 1433.28] No light in the darkness you see
[1433.28 → 1435.84] There's light if you look to your Saviour
[1435.84 → 1440.00] And rest in a life lived for him, forever free
[1440.00 → 1464.28] Turn your eyes upon Jesus
[1464.28 → 1471.90] Look full in his wonderful face
[1471.90 → 1479.84] And the things of earth take their rightful place
[1479.84 → 1487.46] In the light of his glory and grace
[1487.46 → 1492.84] O soul, are you heavy laden with your sin
[1492.84 → 1495.26] Working as a slave of the earth
[1495.26 → 1499.14] No rest as you try to work out your own perfection
[1499.14 → 1503.06] Oh, but this perfect blood awaits your confession
[1503.06 → 1510.68] Turn your eyes upon Jesus
[1510.68 → 1523.30] Turn your eyes upon Jesus
[1523.30 → 1524.30] Turn your eyes upon Jesus
[1524.30 → 1530.30] Look full in his wonderful face
[1530.30 → 1537.92] And the things of earth take their rightful place
[1537.92 → 1545.54] In the light of his glory and grace
[1545.54 → 1550.22] O soul, do you question and doubt?
[1551.10 → 1554.28] As trials and tribulations fill every waking hour
[1554.28 → 1558.04] Examine his word and bring him your tears
[1558.04 → 1560.32] And as you walk this road
[1560.32 → 1563.34] May brothers and sisters in Christ draw near
[1563.34 → 1567.96] Turn your eyes upon Jesus
[1567.96 → 1581.42] Turn your eyes upon Jesus
[1581.42 → 1589.04] Look full in his wonderful face
[1589.04 → 1596.16] And the things of earth take their rightful place
[1596.16 → 1603.94] In the light of his glory and grace
[1603.94 → 1633.92] Turn your eyes upon Jesus
[1633.94 → 1663.92] Turn your eyes upon Jesus
[1663.94 → 1666.94] May you do it all in love
[1666.94 → 1670.94] That I might know you in your suffering
[1670.94 → 1679.94] Though you slay me
[1679.94 → 1683.56] Yet I will praise you
[1683.56 → 1686.94] Though you take from me
[1686.94 → 1690.94] I will bless your name
[1690.94 → 1694.94] Though you ruin me
[1694.94 → 1698.94] Still I will worship
[1698.94 → 1703.94] Sing a song to the one who's all I need
[1703.94 → 1713.94] My heart and flesh may fail
[1713.94 → 1716.94] My heart and flesh may fail
[1716.94 → 1719.94] The earth below give way
[1719.94 → 1723.94] With my eyes, with my eyes
[1723.94 → 1724.94] I'll see the Lord
[1724.94 → 1725.94] I'll see the Lord
[1725.94 → 1730.94] Lifted I upon that day
[1730.94 → 1734.94] Behold the land that was slain
[1734.94 → 1745.18] was slain and I'll know every tear was worth it all
[1745.18 → 1756.30] you slay me yet I will praise you though you take from me
[1756.30 → 1764.30] I will bless your name though you ruin me
[1764.30 → 1778.30] still I will worship sing a song to the one who's all I need
[1778.30 → 1788.30] now tonight I'm crying out let this cup pass from me now
[1788.30 → 1792.30] you're still more than I need
[1792.30 → 1802.30] you're enough for me
[1802.30 → 1806.30] you're enough for me
[1806.30 → 1826.30] I will bless your name though you ruin me still I will worship sing a song to the one who's all
[1826.30 → 1840.30] I need
[1840.30 → 1854.30] sing a song to the one who's all I need
[1854.30 → 1870.30] sing a song to the one who's all I need
[1870.30 → 1876.30] you unravel me with a melody
[1876.30 → 1882.30] you surround me with a song
[1882.30 → 1886.30] of deliverance
[1886.30 → 1890.30] from my enemies
[1890.30 → 1896.30] till all my fears are gone
[1896.30 → 1908.30] I'm no longer a slave to fear
[1908.30 → 1914.30] I am a child of god
[1914.30 → 1942.30] from my mother's womb
[1942.30 → 1946.30] you have chosen me
[1946.30 → 1952.30] love has called my name
[1952.30 → 1956.30] I've been born again
[1956.30 → 1960.30] into your family
[1960.30 → 1966.30] your blood flows through my veins
[1966.30 → 1968.30] I'm no longer a slave to fear
[1968.30 → 1980.30] I am a child of god
[1980.30 → 1986.30] I'm no longer a slave to fear
[1986.30 → 1996.30] I am a child of god
[1996.30 → 2000.30] I'm no longer a slave to fear
[2000.30 → 2004.30] I am a child of god
[2004.30 → 2010.30] I am a child of god
[2010.30 → 2016.30] I'm no longer a slave to fear
[2016.30 → 2022.30] I am a child of god
[2022.30 → 2036.30] you
[2036.30 → 2038.30] you split the sea
[2038.30 → 2042.30] you split the sea so I could walk right through it
[2042.30 → 2046.30] my fears were drowned in perfect love
[2046.30 → 2048.30] you
[2048.30 → 2050.30] you
[2050.30 → 2052.30] you
[2052.30 → 2053.30] you
[2053.30 → 2066.30] you
[2066.30 → 2068.30] you
[2068.30 → 2070.82] I threw it.
[2071.34 → 2075.62] My fears were drowned in perfect love.
[2077.30 → 2083.70] You rescued me so I could stand and sing.
[2083.70 → 2090.16] I am a child of God.
[2091.00 → 2096.38] I am a child of God.
[2096.38 → 2104.56] I am a child of God.
[2106.88 → 2113.78] I'm no longer a slave to fear.
[2115.72 → 2121.18] I am a child of God.
[2121.18 → 2127.92] I'm no longer a slave to fear.
[2129.36 → 2136.04] I am a child of God.
[2136.04 → 2146.22] I am a child of God.
[2146.22 → 2148.08] You may be seated.
[2148.82 → 2150.04] It's time for our offering.
[2150.04 → 2158.22] I am a child of God.
[2158.22 → 2160.22] I am a child of God.
[2160.22 → 2162.36] I am a child of God.
[2162.36 → 2170.54] I am a child of God.
[2170.54 → 2172.54] I am a child of God.
[2172.54 → 2172.86] I am a child of God.
[2172.86 → 2183.04] I am a child of God.
[2183.04 → 2184.04] I am a child of God.
[2184.04 → 2184.50] Good morning.
[2185.50 → 2187.18] I tried that, but it works better with Kevin.
[2188.64 → 2189.30] Good morning.
[2189.46 → 2191.68] My name is Brenda, and I'm one of the deacons here at Emmanuel.
[2191.68 → 2194.62] We continue our worship with the giving of our gifts.
[2194.62 → 2199.96] First to the budget which covers the administration of our church and its ministries and our special
[2199.96 → 2202.64] offering today is for Life Water Canada.
[2203.28 → 2209.86] For some of you who would remember one of our former pastors, Pastor Bill Herself helped
[2209.86 → 2214.68] out this organization with an invention which tested the quality of water in the wells.
[2214.68 → 2217.92] Why is safe water so important?
[2217.92 → 2222.50] Because without it children and their families must drink dirty water from swamps, ponds and
[2222.50 → 2224.22] other potentially deadly sources.
[2224.22 → 2228.24] Something that we're not used to here.
[2228.24 → 2229.40] We don't have to deal with.
[2229.40 → 2232.80] But when children are sick they cannot go to school.
[2232.80 → 2236.94] When adults are sick they cannot earn the money needed to care for their families.
[2236.94 → 2241.72] In this way contaminated water prevents families, communities and entire regions from
[2241.72 → 2244.54] reaching their God given potential.
[2244.54 → 2249.82] Calling water each day takes a lot of time, and it's usually the job of women and girls
[2249.82 → 2252.58] who spend many hours doing this.
[2252.58 → 2257.54] Every well that's drilled, every pump that gets repaired makes water more accessible and
[2257.54 → 2263.30] reduces the need to spend so much time hauling it for a great distance.
[2263.30 → 2268.80] Life Water Canada makes a lasting difference by investing locally.
[2268.80 → 2274.50] Volunteers train and equip people in Africa and Haiti to drill wells and to build washrooms.
[2274.50 → 2279.48] Order giving helps overseas villages that can't afford the full cost of critically needed
[2279.48 → 2282.22] clean water and sanitation.
[2282.22 → 2287.50] Every dollar given provides a child with safe water for a year.
[2287.50 → 2293.78] There's a well known African proverb that says, give a man a fish and feed him for a day.
[2293.78 → 2296.50] Teach him to fish, feed him for life.
[2296.50 → 2300.50] Next week's offering is for Judge.
[2300.50 → 2302.50] Let us give as the Lord has blessed us.
[2302.50 → 2307.50] Let us give as the Lord has blessed us.
[2307.50 → 2308.50] Let us serve.
[2308.50 → 2310.50] Let us serve.
[2310.50 → 2312.50] so
[2312.50 → 2336.76] My soul finds rest in God alone
[2336.76 → 2340.62] My rock and my salvation
[2340.62 → 2345.62] A fortress strong against my foes
[2345.62 → 2349.24] And I will not be shaken
[2349.24 → 2354.14] Though lips may bless and hearts may curse
[2354.14 → 2358.36] And lies like arrows pierce me
[2358.36 → 2362.04] I'll fix my heart on righteousness
[2362.04 → 2367.42] I'll look to Him who hears me
[2367.42 → 2371.42] Oh, praise Him, Alleluia
[2371.42 → 2377.42] My delight and my reward
[2377.42 → 2382.42] Everlasting, ever-failing
[2382.42 → 2387.42] My Redeemer, my God
[2387.42 → 2400.04] Find rest my soul in God alone
[2400.04 → 2404.32] Amid the world's temptations
[2404.32 → 2408.44] When evil seeks to take a hold
[2408.44 → 2412.04] I'll cling to my salvation
[2412.04 → 2416.04] Though riches come and riches go
[2416.04 → 2421.04] Don't set your heart upon them
[2421.04 → 2425.04] The fields of hope in which I sow
[2425.04 → 2429.04] Are harvested in heaven
[2429.04 → 2435.04] Oh, praise Him, Alleluia
[2435.04 → 2439.04] My delight and my reward
[2439.04 → 2444.04] Everlasting, never-failing
[2444.04 → 2449.04] My Redeemer, my God
[2449.04 → 2462.04] I'll set my gaze on God alone
[2462.04 → 2465.66] And trust in Him completely
[2465.66 → 2470.04] With every day pour out my soul
[2470.04 → 2474.04] And He will prove His mercy
[2474.04 → 2478.04] Oh, life is but a fleeting breath
[2478.04 → 2482.04] A sigh to breathe, to measure
[2482.04 → 2487.04] My King has crushed the curse of death
[2487.04 → 2489.04] And I am His forever
[2489.04 → 2490.04] And I am His forever
[2490.04 → 2496.04] Oh, praise Him, Alleluia
[2496.04 → 2501.04] My delight and my reward
[2501.04 → 2506.04] Everlasting, never-failing
[2506.04 → 2511.04] My Redeemer, my God
[2511.04 → 2513.04] O, praise Him, Alleluia
[2513.04 → 2517.04] O, praise Him, Alleluia
[2517.04 → 2522.04] My delight and my reward
[2522.04 → 2527.04] Everlasting, never-failing
[2527.04 → 2532.04] My Redeemer, my God
[2532.04 → 2555.04] I would love to invite the kids to come up front.
[2555.04 → 2557.04] We're going to sit right here this morning.
[2557.04 → 2560.04] Come on up, everyone.
[2560.04 → 2563.04] Hi!
[2563.04 → 2564.04] Hi!
[2564.04 → 2565.04] Hi, hi!
[2565.04 → 2566.04] Hi, hi, hi!
[2566.04 → 2567.04] Hi, hi, hi!
[2567.04 → 2568.04] Ah!
[2569.04 → 2571.04] Too close, too close!
[2571.04 → 2572.04] Back up!
[2572.04 → 2573.04] Oh!
[2573.04 → 2574.04] Now he's hiding.
[2574.04 → 2577.04] He's behind his back!
[2577.04 → 2579.04] All right, how is everyone doing?
[2579.04 → 2580.04] Good, yeah!
[2580.04 → 2582.04] Do you think Hank wants to come out again?
[2582.04 → 2583.04] Yeah!
[2583.04 → 2585.04] All right, we might have to stop punching him though.
[2585.04 → 2587.04] Hank?
[2587.04 → 2588.04] Yeah?
[2588.04 → 2589.04] Are you ready to come out?
[2589.04 → 2590.04] Mm-hmm!
[2590.04 → 2591.04] Hi, everyone!
[2591.04 → 2592.04] It's a puppet!
[2592.04 → 2593.04] Guess what, everybody?
[2593.04 → 2594.04] Hank?
[2594.04 → 2595.04] I know I've been keeping this secret for a long time.
[2595.04 → 2596.04] But Hank?
[2596.04 → 2597.04] Puppet!
[2597.04 → 2598.04] He's a puppet!
[2598.04 → 2599.04] I'm a puppet!
[2599.04 → 2601.04] But that's okay, he's still very fun, isn't he?
[2601.04 → 2602.04] I'm still fun, I promise!
[2602.04 → 2603.04] Guess what, Hank?
[2603.04 → 2604.04] What?
[2604.04 → 2619.04] We were asked this morning, actually, specifically you were asked this morning, a little bit
[2619.04 → 2623.04] last minute to lead children's worship time today.
[2623.04 → 2624.04] Ooh!
[2624.04 → 2627.04] Do you think you can handle it?
[2627.04 → 2628.04] All right.
[2628.04 → 2629.04] Hank, I'll give it to you.
[2629.04 → 2630.04] Hank?
[2630.04 → 2631.04] I'll give it to you.
[2631.04 → 2632.04] Okay!
[2632.04 → 2633.04] What do I do?
[2633.04 → 2635.04] You just have to tell the story.
[2635.04 → 2636.04] Oh!
[2636.04 → 2637.04] Okay, I can do that!
[2637.04 → 2638.04] Okay!
[2639.04 → 2640.04] What's the story?
[2640.04 → 2641.04] Oh, okay.
[2641.04 → 2646.04] We're going to talk today in children's worship time about Jesus and the road to Emmaus.
[2646.04 → 2647.04] Oh!
[2647.04 → 2648.04] Okay!
[2648.04 → 2649.04] So you can tell that a little bit.
[2649.04 → 2650.04] Why don't you explain it?
[2650.04 → 2651.04] Okay!
[2653.04 → 2654.04] How does that story go?
[2654.04 → 2655.04] Okay!
[2655.04 → 2657.04] The story of Jesus and the road to Emmaus.
[2657.04 → 2660.04] Jesus goes on a walk with a few people.
[2660.04 → 2661.04] A walk!
[2661.04 → 2663.04] I love walks!
[2664.04 → 2666.04] What a good story!
[2667.04 → 2669.04] So we're gonna talk about that walk in children's worship time today.
[2669.04 → 2670.04] Does that sound good?
[2670.04 → 2671.04] Mm-hmm!
[2671.04 → 2673.04] But you're going to stay back here in church, okay, Hank?
[2673.04 → 2674.04] Mm-hmm!
[2675.04 → 2676.04] Oh, he's sad.
[2676.04 → 2678.04] I think I'll tell Hank the story later.
[2678.04 → 2679.04] Yeah!
[2679.04 → 2680.04] And then can we go for a walk?
[2680.04 → 2682.04] Yeah, we'll go for a walk later too, okay?
[2682.04 → 2683.04] Does that sound good?
[2683.04 → 2685.04] Should we hear that story in children's worship time?
[2685.04 → 2686.04] Yeah?
[2686.04 → 2687.04] Okay, let's pray.
[2687.04 → 2690.04] And then we'll do the children's blessing, and then we'll go listen to that story, okay?
[2690.04 → 2691.04] Mm-hmm!
[2691.04 → 2692.04] All right, bow your heads.
[2692.04 → 2693.04] Dear God, thank you for this day.
[2693.04 → 2695.04] Thank you that we could be in church today.
[2695.04 → 2700.04] We pray that you'll be with us as we learn more about you and be with our grown-ups and
[2700.04 → 2705.04] parents and the adults here in church as well who learn more about you from Pastor Chris.
[2705.04 → 2706.04] We pray this in your name.
[2706.04 → 2707.04] Amen.
[2707.04 → 2708.04] All right, let's stand up.
[2708.04 → 2715.04] And let's say, the Lord be with you together.
[2715.04 → 2716.04] Are you ready?
[2716.04 → 2719.04] The Lord be with you!
[2719.04 → 2723.04] All right, let's head to children's worship time.
[2738.04 → 2756.04] Hi, my name is Dick, and I am a child of God.
[2756.04 → 2760.04] And I pray that you can say the same.
[2760.04 → 2767.04] There are a number of family prayer concerns and each one of these people covets your prayers.
[2767.04 → 2773.04] And I'll just read them out because I have a hard time reading these when my eyes are closed.
[2773.04 → 2777.04] So, first, the Mexico team arrived safely back home.
[2777.04 → 2779.04] Hope you had an awesome time.
[2779.04 → 2788.04] And Joel ALCAPA is coaching a gold medal wheelchair basketball team in Vernon, and we pray for safe travels.
[2788.04 → 2790.04] Now the tougher ones.
[2790.04 → 2791.04] Oops.
[2791.04 → 2795.04] Fred Kotz's mother is in the hospital.
[2795.04 → 2796.04] She has dementia.
[2796.04 → 2798.04] She's 94 years old.
[2798.04 → 2805.04] She's coming home, but the challenge now for the family is they have to find a place for her because she can't live on her own.
[2805.04 → 2809.04] Helen Van Eric returned home Saturday.
[2809.04 → 2814.04] She was treated for a bad case of pneumonia and is also doing well.
[2814.04 → 2818.04] CY Kisser was taken to the hospital this past week.
[2818.04 → 2821.04] He's being treated for low white blood cells.
[2821.04 → 2826.04] And he's home again, and he will continue his treatments as he recovers.
[2826.04 → 2837.04] We'll also pray for John Vanderhoek as he is now with the Lord. Praise God.
[2837.04 → 2841.04] And I'm sure you had a tough day yesterday as you say goodbye.
[2841.04 → 2844.04] And the journey is never easy.
[2844.04 → 2848.04] We pray for Mrs. Vanderhoek and your entire family.
[2848.04 → 2850.04] God bless.
[2850.04 → 2858.04] And then this morning we were in the council room, and we heard that John and Joanne Zoning, a lot of you know them.
[2858.04 → 2865.04] John has invasive melanoma cancer, and it's already spread to certain organs.
[2865.04 → 2868.04] So let's come to our God in prayer.
[2868.04 → 2873.04] Our Father who art in heaven.
[2873.04 → 2877.04] Lord, we are so blessed to be able to say that.
[2877.04 → 2885.04] Lord, if we can't say that, if we can't say Jesus is our Saviour, we pray that we can get on our knees and ask you.
[2885.04 → 2886.04] Ask you for forgiveness.
[2886.04 → 2888.04] Ask you to be our Saviour.
[2888.04 → 2894.04] Lord, that we may have a place after this world is done.
[2894.04 → 2896.04] Because at one point it's going to be done.
[2896.04 → 2899.04] And each one of us, Lord, will live in glory.
[2899.04 → 2904.04] And you give us the option of that.
[2904.04 → 2906.04] Lord, thank you for this week.
[2906.04 → 2908.04] Lord, some of us had a tough week.
[2908.04 → 2911.04] Saying goodbye to somebody is never easy, Lord.
[2911.04 → 2918.04] And then as we say goodbye, and then we live, especially if we live alone, Lord.
[2918.04 → 2922.04] We've had that partner for years and years and years.
[2922.04 → 2924.04] We've done so much with them, Lord.
[2924.04 → 2926.04] We've raised children.
[2926.04 → 2929.04] We've helped raise grandchildren.
[2929.04 → 2931.04] We've seen our kids married.
[2931.04 → 2935.04] Lord, and then we have to say goodbye.
[2935.04 → 2939.04] We know where the next person went to.
[2939.04 → 2944.04] And yet, there will be a time when we...
[2944.04 → 2947.04] It's a memory.
[2947.04 → 2950.04] Lord, we pray for this week of spring break.
[2950.04 → 2953.04] And last week, we thank you for sunny weather.
[2953.04 → 2956.04] We thank you for people that can travel.
[2956.04 → 2960.04] And we pray will you watch over them.
[2960.04 → 2963.04] We pray will you be with the teachers as they've been given a break.
[2963.04 → 2965.04] Lord, help them to have a break.
[2965.04 → 2971.04] Lord, we pray especially for people who are single parents among us.
[2971.04 → 2975.04] We're still raising kids, teenage kids, Lord.
[2975.04 → 2977.04] We pray will you be with them.
[2977.04 → 2982.04] Will you help us, each one of us, to reach out to them if we know them.
[2982.04 → 2986.04] Lord, we ask you for a blessing on your service this morning.
[2986.04 → 2989.04] We thank you that we can come here Sunday after Sunday
[2989.04 → 2994.04] to listen to your word, to sing praises, to fellowship with each other.
[2994.04 → 2997.04] Lord, we praise will you help and guide us.
[2997.04 → 2999.04] And we know you do, Lord.
[2999.04 → 3000.04] Thank you in Jesus' name.
[3000.04 → 3001.04] Amen.
[3012.04 → 3014.04] Amen.
[3014.04 → 3016.04] Amen.
[3016.04 → 3017.04] Amen.
[3017.04 → 3019.04] Amen.
[3021.04 → 3022.04] Amen.
[3022.04 → 3023.04] Amen.
[3023.04 → 3024.04] Amen.
[3024.04 → 3025.04] Amen.
[3025.04 → 3026.04] Amen.
[3026.04 → 3027.04] Amen.
[3029.04 → 3030.04] Amen.
[3030.04 → 3031.04] Amen.
[3031.04 → 3032.04] Amen.
[3032.04 → 3033.04] Amen.
[3033.04 → 3034.04] Amen.
[3034.04 → 3035.30] Amen.
[3035.30 → 3042.14] and we were talking about you guys we were talking about church and
[3042.14 → 3050.42] and as we were talking I had opportunity to think about and to reflect on
[3051.06 → 3060.12] I love you guys and just how much we love this church community and this fellowship and
[3060.12 → 3065.96] being together and seeing the way this community encourages and supports
[3065.96 → 3074.60] you know this last week these last couple weeks this last month these last many months
[3074.60 → 3082.32] has been a reminder of just how amazing it is to be part of you and with you
[3082.32 → 3093.48] and this morning in our worship together it's a reminder for me to just give thanks to God for
[3093.48 → 3100.30] you I hope and pray that you experience a little bit of that same thing every now again I hope and
[3100.30 → 3109.76] pray that this morning in our worship that you had a taste of that say if you are watching online and
[3109.76 → 3115.70] have participated for a long time and have not come may this be your invitation
[3115.70 → 3138.06] okay we're going to switch out let's just switch out to be sure yeah
[3139.76 → 3144.98] if you're online and didn't hear what I said you should come next week you'll hear what I said
[3144.98 → 3145.70] you
[3145.70 → 3161.70] you
[3169.76 → 3194.76] and there we go one of the reasons I love you is because of how you roll through something like
[3194.76 → 3208.76] that just so casually one of the reasons it's going to be one of those days folks one of the reasons
[3208.76 → 3219.76] that I'm grateful for you is your engagement here in worship and in the word, and so we're going to open the
[3219.76 → 3224.76] word together we're going to continue in our series in Romans
[3224.76 → 3231.76] we're going to read from Romans 6 the first 14 verses it's going to be on the screen but of course as always
[3231.76 → 3235.76] I encourage you to have a Bible in your hands or on a device whatever that may be
[3235.76 → 3240.76] so that you can refer back with us as we do so later
[3240.76 → 3248.36] open the eyes of your heart and hear the word of the Lord
[3248.36 → 3258.38] what shall we say then shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase by no means
[3258.38 → 3268.00] we are those who have died to sin how can we live any longer in it or don't you know that all of us who
[3268.00 → 3275.60] were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death we were therefore buried with him through
[3275.60 → 3282.16] baptism into death in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the
[3282.16 → 3291.40] father we too may live a new life for if we have been united with him in a death like his we will
[3291.40 → 3299.00] certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his for we know that our old self was crucified
[3299.00 → 3307.00] with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with that we should no longer be slaves to sin
[3307.00 → 3317.40] because anyone who has died has been set free from sin now if we died with Christ we believe that we will also
[3317.40 → 3324.04] live with him for we know that since Christ was raised from the dead he cannot die again
[3325.00 → 3335.00] death no longer has mastery over him the death he died to sin once for all but the life he lives
[3335.00 → 3345.80] he lives to God in the same way count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus therefore do
[3345.80 → 3352.68] not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires do not offer any part of yourself
[3352.68 → 3360.44] to sin as an instrument of wickedness but rather offer yourselves to God as those who have been brought from
[3360.44 → 3369.80] death to life and offer every part of yourself to him as an instrument of righteousness for sin
[3369.80 → 3379.72] shall no longer be your master because you are not under the law but under grace this is the word of the Lord
[3379.72 → 3395.80] given the time of year that it is now in March and specifically March 2023 I had opportunity to reflect on
[3395.80 → 3399.64] what was happening three years ago in our world
[3399.64 → 3405.24] three years ago
[3406.44 → 3414.04] began the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown and restrictions now at the time I was
[3415.24 → 3421.00] pastoring a small to middle-sized church 120 people or so
[3421.80 → 3425.08] I was the only full-time staff person at this church
[3425.08 → 3431.80] I had a few other staff and lots of volunteers who were awesome and excellent but when COVID hit
[3431.80 → 3435.88] and all those lockdowns came it fell to me to figure out what to do
[3437.64 → 3443.88] now as a small church we didn't have a lot of the same sort of tech and resources that we have here for
[3443.88 → 3451.16] instance, and so we didn't know what we were going to do, and so I took our personal family camera
[3451.16 → 3457.56] you know like 720p max like a gig storage on it
[3458.60 → 3460.76] and recorded a video
[3462.52 → 3464.20] and then realized that
[3465.88 → 3472.60] the card only recorded about eight minutes of my sermon so then I had to record the next eight minutes
[3473.08 → 3474.68] and then figure out how to stitch it together
[3474.68 → 3480.84] and so at the beginning of that time I downloaded a program
[3481.80 → 3483.56] to learn how to do video editing
[3485.00 → 3486.44] I'd never done that before
[3487.08 → 3490.28] was not something that was part of my ordinary working experience
[3491.48 → 3493.16] and yet I had no choice
[3494.20 → 3497.72] and because of the requirements of COVID at that time in Ontario
[3497.72 → 3502.52] we were shut down, and so we put together this idea for a church at home
[3503.08 → 3509.64] where everything was pre-recorded and people could with their families kind of follow along with books that we had produced
[3509.64 → 3514.60] but again I had to figure out how to record all of that how to stitch it all together how to upload it to YouTube
[3516.52 → 3524.28] point is I spent hours and hours and hours learning this video editing software
[3524.28 → 3533.72] and that continued over the next three years even when I came here one of the first things we ended up putting together was a Christmas day
[3533.72 → 3537.48] at home service which was all pre-recorded and stitched it together and
[3539.32 → 3541.08] now I'm not saying I'm a master
[3542.60 → 3547.16] but I am saying you've seen these treat tag videos and I think they're pretty awesome
[3547.16 → 3551.16] and so we've learned some skills
[3551.96 → 3554.60] because of the hours put into this thing
[3555.00 → 3557.96] right and the reason I offer this is an illustration
[3558.92 → 3559.24] because
[3560.36 → 3562.04] we're going to talk this morning about
[3563.24 → 3571.16] gospel mastery or what does it mean to be mastered by the gospel and I forget who it was but there's someone who said that
[3571.16 → 3579.24] that mastery comes after 10,000 hours of doing the same thing over and over and over again
[3580.68 → 3582.84] you can learn mastery
[3585.00 → 3587.96] you can learn to master a new thing
[3590.12 → 3592.28] part of this is growth mindset
[3592.84 → 3594.28] that is all in
[3595.16 → 3597.88] rage for parenting right now right because you can
[3597.88 → 3600.04] yeah, you might not know how to do something
[3600.04 → 3600.28] yet
[3601.24 → 3603.32] Rachel just was like yes, you got it finally
[3604.76 → 3607.80] right you can develop these skills
[3608.44 → 3610.76] and so that's what I hope we might begin to do
[3611.40 → 3613.48] today developing a gospel
[3614.20 → 3614.76] mastery
[3616.28 → 3622.04] because as we have been working through the book of Romans what I hope you have seen in part
[3622.04 → 3624.44] is a comparison
[3625.72 → 3633.48] to the way of being in the world and the way of being that is on offer to us in the gospel
[3635.24 → 3644.44] right it's ordinary in our world to think about or when you think about how you are in the world how to be in the world whether you are a religious person
[3644.44 → 3646.76] or a spiritual person or not
[3646.76 → 3647.00] right
[3647.00 → 3653.16] right we generally approach being in the world as trying to be basically
[3654.04 → 3654.36] good
[3655.88 → 3662.04] or at least when all things are measured and tallied at the end we want to come out
[3662.60 → 3667.48] on the side of what I'm going to call it this morning a higher good quotient
[3667.48 → 3672.28] right when it all adds up we hope we have more good on the scale than
[3672.92 → 3673.24] bad
[3675.00 → 3681.56] and what Paul has been saying throughout the first half of the book of Romans is that your good quotient
[3681.56 → 3688.92] the amount of right works that you do is never going to be good enough to earn your salvation
[3690.84 → 3692.52] right at its most basic
[3692.52 → 3694.04] right
[3694.04 → 3702.12] right the problem isn't that we are sinners that is to say we commit sins every now and again the problem is that we are dead
[3702.92 → 3703.96] in
[3703.96 → 3706.20] sin
[3706.20 → 3714.04] right it's too easy for us to think that sin is just doing a little bad thing here and there
[3714.76 → 3718.68] right most of us don't really commit big capital crimes or
[3719.24 → 3722.76] many illegal activities at least not more illegal than speeding
[3724.84 → 3729.32] most of us right don't really think that we are that bad
[3730.12 → 3733.64] and so we conclude that actually we don't have to do a lot
[3734.36 → 3737.72] right to be good or to be good enough for heaven
[3738.76 → 3742.20] but from the beginning in this series
[3742.20 → 3745.64] right we have seen that Paul is showing us
[3745.64 → 3751.24] that the truth about ourselves doesn't line up with this assumption
[3752.12 → 3752.68] in the world
[3753.80 → 3759.16] instead Paul has repeatedly made the point that we are dead in our transgressions and sins
[3759.16 → 3768.52] sins that because of the trespass of Adam all have turned away that there's no one who does good not even one that all fall short of the glory of God
[3770.44 → 3771.48] because of this
[3772.52 → 3776.68] and thanks be to God we have received it because of this we need grace
[3776.68 → 3784.92] grace right and grace I've said before is his is God's unmerited favourable disposition towards us
[3785.80 → 3794.52] right and by grace God calls us out of darkness, and he carries us into his wonderful light, and we need his grace to buy faith
[3795.56 → 3798.84] raise us from being dead in our sin
[3798.84 → 3802.20] and that's exactly what he's done in Jesus
[3803.64 → 3815.00] right in Jesus Christ the righteousness of God is credited to you as your own righteousness because of what we have called here your union with
[3815.80 → 3816.20] Christ
[3817.48 → 3823.64] your union with Jesus through faith and that's the core of the Christian gospel
[3823.64 → 3825.72] and now
[3825.72 → 3828.04] I want to be really clear
[3830.04 → 3831.24] this idea
[3832.04 → 3838.84] right this Christian gospel idea of a received righteousness is amazing and unique
[3839.96 → 3846.52] right every other world religion every other system of being in the world will tell you something along the lines of
[3847.24 → 3848.36] do this
[3848.36 → 3849.40] do this
[3849.40 → 3850.04] do this
[3850.68 → 3851.64] and you will get this
[3852.76 → 3859.64] right to earn the reward whether you call that heaven or you's the know house on the lake, or you call it nirvana
[3859.72 → 3864.20] whatever you might call that reward in order to get it you've got to do these things
[3865.40 → 3868.60] right you have to fill up your good works' quotient
[3869.48 → 3871.16] and then good will come to you
[3872.28 → 3876.04] the gospel of Jesus on the other hand says it's all done
[3876.04 → 3878.04] and then he freely gives it to you
[3882.84 → 3884.28] but this idea of salvation
[3885.40 → 3890.20] that salvation is free is so hard for us to comprehend
[3890.68 → 3894.44] because of the frame that we live in the way that we see the world
[3895.32 → 3900.92] that we can't help but think that it requires a good works quotient of some kind
[3901.88 → 3909.56] and so what Paul does is he anticipates a question from his audience in a masterful way
[3910.60 → 3911.64] because he sees
[3912.52 → 3918.52] what is possibly happening he sees what is happening and that's the idea that people take this
[3919.16 → 3925.48] good quotient this good works quotient idea, and then they apply it to grace
[3925.48 → 3931.96] right the idea the logic being that if it is only by grace that I am saved from sin
[3931.96 → 3938.76] then why bother stop sinning right because I can just do whatever I want because as my sin quotient rises
[3939.32 → 3941.00] so will the grace quotient
[3942.68 → 3948.92] right you see what Paul is exposing for us in the way that we think right that if I can just keep on
[3948.92 → 3957.16] sinning even if I'm saved by Jesus because grace will cover it we've taken that old and sort of way of the world
[3957.16 → 3964.28] seeing and being right about the good quotient, and then we've sort of transposed it or superimposed it
[3964.28 → 3972.68] over top of this idea of salvation by grace so that now it says the grace quotient will raise and
[3972.68 → 3976.28] will cover over these things so it doesn't actually matter in the end
[3978.28 → 3984.84] now anticipating that question and that leap in logic Paul shuts it down right away at the beginning
[3985.48 → 3990.28] in verse one of our chapter he says what then shall we say or what shall we say then
[3991.00 → 4002.20] shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase by no means he says, and then he does this beautiful thing
[4003.08 → 4014.20] by changing a small little word a preposition right where we were before receiving grace the grace of god
[4014.20 → 4024.20] is to be dead in our transgressions and sins Paul says that we are now those who have died to sin
[4024.20 → 4034.28] so the shift is being dead in our transgressions to sins and sins right to having died to sin that's
[4034.28 → 4040.76] what grace does that's what the gospel does, and it gives you this new life and this way the way of
[4040.76 → 4049.32] this new life and to this new life is through death the death of Jesus on the cross makes possible your
[4049.32 → 4059.56] death to sin in this life and if you are dead to sin Paul asks how can we willingly to live in it any longer
[4061.32 → 4067.16] and so again let me be abundantly clear what I hope and pray that you will see and that you might
[4067.16 → 4076.44] begin to see in this beautiful message from Romans 6 is that it's not just that we try harder
[4079.08 → 4086.84] but that you experience victory right it's not just that we have to work a little more but that you
[4086.84 → 4096.36] can actually live life defeated to sin defeating sin again it's not that you won't keep on sinning
[4096.36 → 4101.32] because you will, it's not that you won't experience brokenness in the world or the consequences
[4101.32 → 4109.32] of sin in the world because we all will it's that it whatever that it is for you is no longer the
[4109.32 → 4120.28] driving force the defining desire you are no longer captive to sin now maybe it helps to put this in
[4120.28 → 4127.64] a bit of a picture context uh as far as the I'm sorry a bigger context in a moment the picture a bigger
[4127.64 → 4136.12] context as far as Romans goes so the first five chapters of in the book of Romans Paul helps us see
[4136.12 → 4146.92] what it is and explain how it is that god has uh accomplished the gospel for us right what he did
[4146.92 → 4153.64] and how he did it and why he had to do it and then chapter eight through or chapter six through eight
[4154.36 → 4162.84] begin to tell us what god will accomplish in us through the gospel right in chapter six through
[4162.84 → 4170.76] eight we begin to see how you might experience this truth the truth of the gospel and how it might
[4170.76 → 4179.48] begin to transform every day of your life and key to this transformation is the understanding of what
[4179.48 → 4189.24] it means to have died to sin so in chapter five verse 21 the verse just before where we
[4189.24 → 4201.00] read Paul writes so that just as sin reigned in death right sin reigned in death that means that sin
[4201.00 → 4207.64] was the ruling power in the world and in our lives before the gospel of grace was applied
[4208.92 → 4213.24] and so again let's take it all the way back in chapter one right Paul talked about how
[4213.24 → 4221.24] how apart from the intervening work of Jesus in what we've called his super abundant application of
[4221.24 → 4229.96] grace right that apart from that we have been given over to our sinful desires such that these sinful
[4229.96 → 4238.68] desires ruled us they reigned over us, they had mastery in our lives I mean they have mastery that
[4238.68 → 4245.08] means we can't resist them that we're slaves to them now some of you know intimately what I'm talking
[4245.08 → 4253.80] about right now that no matter how hard you try you can't change that thing right you can't seem to stop
[4253.80 → 4261.56] doing whatever that may be and whatever it may be for you what Paul is saying here and now in Romans 6 is
[4261.56 → 4270.36] that we are dead to sin and what he means in part is that where sin previously reigned now sin no longer
[4270.36 → 4279.80] reigns right and because it no longer reigns he's introducing for us the ability that you have because
[4279.80 → 4287.40] of your union with Christ to resist and rebel against it and again right that's not because of our
[4287.40 → 4295.32] own work, but it's because of the work of Christ in us there is a new power at work in your life and
[4295.32 → 4304.84] that is the power of god Jesus says to Paul in acts 26 verse 18 he says that the gospel has come to
[4304.84 → 4315.32] people to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to the power of god
[4317.96 → 4325.88] now let me see if I can illustrate this with an um an analogy this comes from one of the books that i
[4325.88 → 4336.76] read this week in preparation for here imagine that there is a country where an evil military force
[4336.76 → 4346.68] is ruling over the people with an iron fist, and it's not really hard to imagine right but such that it holds the
[4346.68 → 4357.40] entire nation under thumb and captive but one day a good army sweeps in and overthrows that evil
[4357.40 → 4363.08] force that kicks them out of power removes them from the capital takes back the seat of government
[4363.08 → 4371.88] takes back uh takes control back of the media uh and forces uh takes control of the media forces the old
[4371.88 → 4379.80] army out and is now in charge of all the communication to the people but those who have been kicked out of
[4379.80 → 4387.32] power that evil army they no longer are on the seat of rule they no longer have defined authority but
[4387.32 → 4395.72] they go out, and they live in the bush and this force becomes a guerrilla style force that creates
[4395.72 → 4403.40] disaster and causes destruction and wreaks havoc for this new rightful government right it's even possible
[4403.40 → 4409.40] that this guerrilla force could impose its will on part of the country right that it could take over a
[4409.40 → 4417.96] a portion for a period of uh season but based on the differences in what has happened it would be
[4417.96 → 4423.56] impossible for them to get back into full power it would be impossible for them to take the seat of
[4423.56 → 4430.12] government back though they still exercise some of their divisiveness in the region
[4430.12 → 4441.32] your heart is the seat of power and the capital of your life in this analogy and by grace through faith
[4441.32 → 4451.72] there is a new head a new king and his name is Jesus but that old force right that that longs to usurp and divide
[4451.72 → 4463.48] okay let's I think that the bible is the most realistic and honest book there is when it comes to the human condition
[4464.76 → 4473.56] because the bible knows that you may yet obey the desire for sin right the bible predicts that you will do it
[4473.56 → 4485.48] but the truth of the gospel is that you no longer have to obey it right that's the shift that has come
[4486.52 → 4495.48] right your desires have been transformed by grace through faith if you believe and so Paul says how can
[4495.48 → 4502.68] we live with it any longer and then what he does is he gives us this illustration from baptism
[4503.80 → 4512.92] now in Paul's day that the overwhelming majority of baptismal experiences is the result of adult
[4512.92 → 4520.36] believing conversion and then done by total immersion into a river or into a pool that had been
[4520.36 → 4527.16] built in the floor of a meeting place of some kind and so the image that Paul is drawing upon of being
[4527.16 → 4533.48] baptized into Christ Jesus as a spiritual metaphor for being baptized into his death
[4533.48 → 4541.24] fits because in death you are lowered down into the ground just like in baptism you are lowered down
[4541.24 → 4548.68] into the water below its surface, and so he says we were therefore buried with him through baptism into
[4548.68 → 4556.68] death in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the father we too may live a new
[4556.68 → 4567.80] life the beauty of baptism is its mystery not that it's somehow magical right and the mystery of baptism is
[4567.80 → 4576.04] that it's a sing and a seal it's a picture of a spiritual reality that is true for each one of us who believes
[4576.04 → 4583.00] and when we believe we are united to Christ so that whatever is true for him
[4584.84 → 4590.84] and remember the book of Romans is set up as a legal case right there's a trial that's going on whatever
[4590.84 → 4597.80] is true for him in this legal back and forth whatever new reality Christ has accomplished in the the the
[4597.80 → 4608.84] legal declaration is a new reality for who you are it is applied to you and this then is where we begin
[4608.84 → 4617.72] to see gospel mastery at work right the kind of gospel mastery that we are aiming for this new creation
[4617.72 → 4627.72] reality for us because death frees people from slavery or mastery to sin and Jesus died in our
[4627.72 → 4635.80] place and by grace through faith we are given union with him and by that union just as Christ died so
[4635.80 → 4644.76] have we died to sin, and that union continues read with me in verse 5 if we've been united with him in a
[4644.76 → 4654.76] death like his we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his just as Jesus death led to
[4654.76 → 4661.08] his resurrection and to his resurrection and to new life so to those of us who are united with him who are
[4661.08 → 4671.00] united to Christ will also experience new life it is a logical inevitability it is a consequence of a new
[4671.00 → 4675.08] creation it is a consequence of a new creation it is the fruit of our new life in him
[4677.88 → 4678.04] and
[4680.68 → 4685.72] and i i I get it perhaps better than most
[4687.56 → 4693.88] but some of us have been struggling with the particular sin for so long or struggling with sin
[4693.88 → 4694.60] in general
[4697.00 → 4698.20] that it's really easy
[4699.24 → 4699.88] to miss
[4700.92 → 4702.76] an important word in what we just
[4703.40 → 4707.24] read an important word in verse five and I want to make sure that you hear it and so
[4707.88 → 4708.52] listen in
[4709.80 → 4715.72] for we have been united with him in if we have been united with him in a death like his
[4715.72 → 4727.56] we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his certainly also
[4729.40 → 4737.24] certainly that's what I want you to hear right union with Jesus by grace through faith comes with
[4737.80 → 4744.44] certainty it comes with what the philosophers used to call a measure of foundational certitude
[4744.44 → 4750.76] right with that with a reality of epistemic assurance that you can know this to be true
[4752.28 → 4758.60] right here is how gospel mastery is experienced by you in your life
[4760.12 → 4764.68] right it starts with the objective certainty of the gospel
[4766.84 → 4772.36] and so you've heard me say before that some people talk about faith as a blind leap as or as
[4772.36 → 4777.64] kind of wandering around in the dark hopefully moving forward guessing at whatever's ahead that
[4777.64 → 4783.40] somehow faith is contrary to reason, but that's not at all the way that the bible talks about faith
[4785.08 → 4792.04] now sure faith isn't the same as empirical proof and I use the word proof there in the technical sense
[4792.04 → 4796.28] right in the philosophical scientific sense or mathematical sense of the word
[4796.28 → 4805.16] the word, but our faith does come with certainty with the gospel right it comes with assurance that
[4805.16 → 4812.84] assurance is that just as Jesus rose so too will we be raised just as Jesus was given new life so too are
[4812.84 → 4821.40] we have given new life in a spiritual sense now by the Holy Spirit but then one day in glory at the end of history
[4821.40 → 4828.28] the Holy Spirit but as all the world is moving towards god's intent and purposes for his creation right
[4828.28 → 4837.88] for which he redeemed the world that that truth is certain that reality is unshakeable and when that is
[4837.88 → 4848.44] certain in your life the kinds of questions like verse one don't even cross your mind because you're living
[4848.44 → 4856.12] towards, and you're living for that new creation that certain reality no longer are you looking back
[4856.68 → 4860.12] to death but looking forward in new life
[4862.68 → 4869.64] and so Paul says for we know verse six that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled
[4869.64 → 4876.12] by sin might be done away with that we should no longer be slaves to sin because anyone who has died
[4876.12 → 4888.68] has been set free from sin now in this phrase here that the old self is an identifier for your heart and your mind before the gospel
[4889.80 → 4899.88] it is you when you were still ruled by mastery by slavery to sin the old self is an image of your heart when it was captive
[4899.88 → 4910.68] to the evil government that has since been displaced by Jesus in the language of chapter one the old self is the one who has suppressed the truth of god
[4910.68 → 4918.28] who has been given over to their sinful dire desires the one who's exchanged the truth of god for a lie and worshipped and served created things
[4918.28 → 4927.88] it's the one who still lives in that depraved mind but now because of the gospel we're no longer slaves to sin we've been set free
[4927.88 → 4937.24] set free and so circling back to the beginning why would anyone want to continue in that slavery in that sin that wants to find them
[4937.24 → 4949.56] instead in verse eight if we died with Christ we believe that we will also live with him right death no longer has mastery over him
[4949.56 → 4958.04] the death he died to sin once for all but the life he lives to god and there it is
[4959.64 → 4960.20] right there
[4962.36 → 4973.40] right there who you are in him your new self and your true self your renewed self is lived to and with
[4973.40 → 4981.96] god and again don't hear what I'm not saying okay remember we still struggle with sin in fact the mark
[4981.96 → 4988.28] of the Christian life isn't that there is no struggle right sometimes people I hear people say
[4988.28 → 4994.44] you know if this was really true for me, I wouldn't struggle with that but actually the mark of Christian
[4994.44 → 5000.20] life is that you struggle right that you are struggling right you struggle to live in gratitude and
[5000.20 → 5006.68] obedience to Jesus for what he has done if there's no struggle that means those old desires are still
[5006.68 → 5014.28] ruling but if there is a struggle take heart because that means there's a new ruler there's a new reality
[5014.28 → 5016.76] that you are trying to live to and connect from
[5016.76 → 5029.40] and you know as I was thinking about this maybe the word struggle isn't strong enough
[5031.08 → 5036.68] and maybe we need to go back to that image of a ruling governing army that is displaced by a good army
[5036.68 → 5045.40] by a good king because the truth is there's a war going on or at least there ought to be a war going on
[5046.76 → 5051.32] now there may be people in the world today who no longer have eyes to see it
[5053.48 → 5059.96] because it is a war that is not between flesh and blood but between powers and principalities a war
[5059.96 → 5065.40] that exists between the dark forces and the rulers the dark forces and rulers of the kingdom
[5065.40 → 5071.24] of this world and the kingdom of god the kingdom of light it's not a war like we said of flesh and
[5071.24 → 5078.60] blood it is a war of hearts and minds and the disciple of Jesus who understands the gospel message of
[5078.60 → 5089.24] mastery in newness of life is one who understands that she is at war too many of us have grown lazy
[5089.24 → 5099.96] and apathetic this is war the soldier who doesn't train is the most likely to be lost I have known
[5099.96 → 5106.84] too many people who have given up in their struggle with sin I've known way too many people who assume
[5106.84 → 5113.08] that sin and brokenness will always have more power than they are able to provide and so the war
[5113.08 → 5120.92] has been ended they've ceded the victory they've ceded the territory of their life to this struggle
[5123.08 → 5131.72] but if your heart belongs to Jesus that your life has been bought by him, he has already won the victory
[5132.60 → 5139.00] and he's given you the victory, and he makes you able to experience the kind of gospel mastery in your
[5139.00 → 5144.44] life because it's not your work it's his work in you and through you that's what union with Christ
[5144.44 → 5150.36] is it's not your obedience or your efforts it's his in you and through you and for you
[5151.16 → 5155.48] and every week when I stand up here in front of you and I say that Jesus lived the life I should have
[5155.48 → 5160.52] lived and died the death that I deserved and that three days later he rose again victorious over sin and
[5160.52 → 5170.28] death what that means is now he has given you the power to live the life he has lived right so he died
[5171.00 → 5177.80] death that you deserve because of your life, and he gives you the power to live like him, he's given
[5177.80 → 5183.48] you victory over death and that is certain it's guaranteed
[5187.48 → 5198.28] look i I believe and I believe this because the bible tells me it is true I believe for instance that god
[5199.00 → 5207.56] can break the hold of pornography on your life I believe that god can end the power of addiction
[5207.80 → 5214.84] in your life I believe that god can stop the destruction of your marriage because of the
[5214.84 → 5221.88] anger that's ruling you I believe that god can bring an end to the slavish greed that you have been
[5221.88 → 5228.12] dictated by and dominated by in your life I believe that he could do all of that
[5230.68 → 5231.96] because he raised the dead
[5231.96 → 5243.88] and I believe that the power of god to help you experience this new life in him starts with knowing
[5243.88 → 5252.36] the certainty that if you died with him, you will live with him that the reign of sin in your life
[5252.36 → 5261.64] has ended and the reign of Christ is now your new reality and so please I beg you stop giving power
[5261.64 → 5263.40] to death in your life
[5268.76 → 5272.20] but let the life of Christ reign in you
[5272.20 → 5283.24] offer every part of yourself to him to god as those who have been brought from death to life
[5283.24 → 5288.36] and offer every part of yourself to him as an instrument of righteousness
[5291.00 → 5297.16] for sin shall no longer be your master because you are not under the law but under grace
[5298.68 → 5308.44] mastery over sin in your life is possible it is guaranteed to us by the grace of god in Jesus Christ
[5308.44 → 5317.00] this is the truth of the gospel made evident in you and through you this is how you will experience
[5317.00 → 5325.64] the gospel in your life yes you will fail you will struggle but make that struggle a war
[5326.84 → 5335.48] make that struggle a war and know that already even now by grace through faith you have the victory
[5335.48 → 5350.20] victory live victorious church of god elect and glorious live in the victory of Jesus amen let's pray together
[5351.16 → 5353.48] I'm going to ask you to stand as we pray as well

[5601.90 → 5610.52] And you'll find fresh hope and purpose within Christ Jesus crucified.
[5610.52 → 5623.24] Once you were an alien people, strangers to God's heart of love.
[5623.24 → 5631.88] But he brought you home in mercy, citizens of heaven above.
[5631.88 → 5637.32] Let his love flow out to others.
[5637.98 → 5642.48] Let them feel the Father's care.
[5643.38 → 5646.96] That they too may know his welcome.
[5648.10 → 5652.86] And in his countless blessings share.
