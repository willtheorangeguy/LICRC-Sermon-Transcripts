[656.00 --> 661.32]  Weekend is fast approaching, two weeks away. This church will be flooded with youth that weekend
[661.32 --> 666.48]  from all over BC, and we're really excited. We are upwards of 200 people signed up already with
[666.48 --> 672.18]  one week to go, so we're looking forward to that. And in my pleas for volunteers,
[672.80 --> 676.58]  this church has come through already in droves, so thank you so much for signing up.
[677.04 --> 681.34]  We have lots of spots filled in already, which is wonderful. However, there are still
[681.34 --> 685.78]  a number of positions that need filled. There's still lots of volunteer opportunities available.
[686.26 --> 691.34]  Especially in the areas of overnight security. So if you want to hang out all night and just walk
[691.34 --> 697.46]  around the church property and just make sure kids aren't like fleeing, this is a job for you.
[697.60 --> 701.74]  So overnight security, we're looking for some help. Parking attendance on the Friday afternoon,
[702.00 --> 706.82]  4.30, when they all start showing up, we could use some help there. And we're looking for some hosts
[706.82 --> 711.76]  as well to sort of be present in the building, in the foyer, directing people where they need to go,
[711.76 --> 716.30]  showing them where the bathroom is and where to get to and from. So if you're willing to help out in
[716.30 --> 721.68]  those areas, that'd be great. We also still have lots of room helping out in meals and set up and
[721.68 --> 726.16]  tear down and clean up. So those are all opportunities still available. If you are willing to help out
[726.16 --> 730.98]  and have some more time, please check out that list. It's in the bulletin, or you can talk to me and I
[730.98 --> 735.84]  can get you that link. So we are very excited for that weekend. I am looking forward to that for sure.
[735.84 --> 741.48]  Young adults, you're going for a hike after church this morning. If you're interested in joining that
[741.48 --> 746.36]  hike, talk to Josh. He's in the back. Wave, Josh. There he is. You're going to carpool from here. So go
[746.36 --> 750.82]  chat with him and he'll give you some more information about that. And finally, next week, Sunday,
[751.28 --> 756.86]  we are doing an event called Beat the Topes. So our church softball team, the Isotopes, challenge
[756.86 --> 761.64]  everybody else in this church to a game of softball. We're going to go meet at Topham Park right after
[761.64 --> 765.82]  church. We'll do a bit of a potluck lunch, so bring some food to share. There's a playground
[765.82 --> 772.02]  there for kids to play at. If you're 16 and older and want to take on the Isotopes, please do come
[772.02 --> 776.96]  on out for that. It should be a good time. I've heard tell that the Isotopes will be playing a
[776.96 --> 781.90]  team named called the Nope-Topes. So if you want to play for the Nope-Topes, they are looking for more
[781.90 --> 787.08]  members for that. So that is happening next week, Sunday, after church. I'm now going to invite
[787.08 --> 791.02]  Pastor Chris up to the front, and he is going to greet us as well this morning.
[791.02 --> 802.82]  Good morning. I was instructed by my beautiful bride that Kevin forgot to say that she is the
[802.82 --> 809.04]  volunteer coordinator for Reactivate. And so if you have, you can talk to her and get on that list
[809.04 --> 813.60]  to serve as well. So Rachel, wave your hand. Yeah, she's the beautiful one in the corner over there.
[813.60 --> 820.78]  Talk to her and she'll get you situated there. Today is also Profession of Faith Sunday. And so
[820.78 --> 825.78]  we've got two young people doing Profession of Faith. And these kinds of services are some of my
[825.78 --> 830.68]  favorite throughout the year. And so if you're a guest with us to celebrate Profession of Faith,
[830.78 --> 837.00]  we're so excited that you are here. And we hope and pray that we all together can celebrate the grace
[837.00 --> 843.78]  of God as we see faith growing and burgeoning in the two young men who will stand before us later.
[844.72 --> 849.66]  As you are able, I'm going to invite you to stand. And we can be ushered into the presence of God,
[849.98 --> 856.64]  welcomed by him and greeted in his name. Following the greeting of God, I'm going to encourage you to
[856.64 --> 862.70]  turn around to those near you or far if you want to go for a little walk and welcome them also into
[862.70 --> 867.68]  worship. You can do that in a number of ways. Shake hands, do a little fist pound. You can pass the
[867.68 --> 872.14]  peace of Christ, which is very traditional. Say the peace of Christ be with you or the Lord be with you.
[873.00 --> 878.06]  Or you can give someone a hug if you're close and friendly. But watch their eyes to make sure that
[878.06 --> 883.62]  they're allowing that to happen, like consent matters, okay? Let's worship our God together.
[883.62 --> 893.56]  receive his greeting. Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ,
[893.68 --> 899.78]  his Son and our Savior, through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[913.62 --> 941.20]  Good morning, everyone.
[941.20 --> 951.08]  Our call to worship this morning comes from Psalm chapter 100. Shout for joy to the Lord, all the
[951.08 --> 958.38]  earth. Worship the Lord with gladness. Come before him with joyful songs. Know that the Lord is God.
[958.76 --> 966.42]  It is he who made us, and we are his. We are his people, the sheep of his pasture. Enter his gates with
[966.42 --> 973.28]  thanksgiving and his courts with praise. Give thanks to him and praise his name. For the Lord is good,
[973.36 --> 978.52]  and his love injures forever. His faithfulness continues through all generations.
[978.52 --> 983.54]  forgiveness.
[987.40 --> 996.40]  For the Lord is good, and he is a homeless.
[996.40 --> 998.54]  Ponomous holyclae of the judicial law.
[998.54 --> 1006.06]  Father, into your course I will enter
[1006.06 --> 1011.06]  Maker of heaven and earth
[1011.06 --> 1018.06]  I tremble in your holy presence
[1018.06 --> 1023.90]  Glory, glory in your sanctuary
[1023.90 --> 1028.84]  Splendor and majesty, Lord
[1028.84 --> 1035.26]  Before you, all I adore you
[1035.26 --> 1039.26]  All the earth let me glad
[1039.26 --> 1043.90]  That your love is everywhere
[1043.90 --> 1049.56]  The field to get so seasoned
[1049.56 --> 1057.74]  Hear the trees, joys of land
[1057.74 --> 1061.96]  Praising the moon so we'll find
[1061.96 --> 1066.18]  A new song of sin
[1066.18 --> 1074.42]  Lord, I will glorify and bless your holy name
[1074.42 --> 1082.46]  Jesus, Lord of our life is salvation
[1082.46 --> 1086.52]  Into your presence we cry
[1086.52 --> 1089.00]  We worship
[1089.00 --> 1094.16]  You are precious Savior
[1094.16 --> 1100.10]  Fill us, fill us with your holy power
[1100.10 --> 1105.04]  Set us to claim your love
[1105.04 --> 1111.14]  To nations, all know your glory
[1111.14 --> 1115.06]  For the earth will declare
[1115.06 --> 1119.04]  That your love is everywhere
[1119.04 --> 1124.28]  The field to get so seasoned
[1124.28 --> 1126.42]  Seasons and more
[1126.42 --> 1132.42]  Will I take you in the choice of pride
[1132.42 --> 1137.46]  Praising the moon so we'll find
[1137.46 --> 1141.58]  A new song of sin
[1141.58 --> 1147.38]  Lord, I will glorify and bless your holy
[1147.38 --> 1151.38]  For if I am blessed your holy
[1151.38 --> 1157.38]  For if I am blessed your holy name
[1157.38 --> 1159.38]  For if I am blessed you are blessed
[1159.38 --> 1161.38]  If I am blessed your holy name
[1161.38 --> 1163.38]  To nations, all know your holy name
[1163.38 --> 1165.38]  For if I am blessed you will find
[1165.38 --> 1167.38]  A new song of sin
[1167.38 --> 1168.42]  For if I can be blessed you will find
[1168.42 --> 1170.36]  For if I am blessed you will find
[1170.36 --> 1172.38]  To nations, all know your holy name
[1172.38 --> 1188.20]  Dad's pastor Luke White
[1188.20 --> 1192.92]  This is what I was thinking
[1192.92 --> 1198.60]  Life's a turn 10 to be
[1198.60 --> 1202.60]  Time to live
[1202.60 --> 1209.20]  Hope is still
[1209.20 --> 1213.04]  But I'm tired
[1213.04 --> 1215.60]  So you're so young
[1215.60 --> 1218.60]  And I'm not alone
[1218.60 --> 1220.60]  I'm not alone
[1220.60 --> 1221.60]  I'm not alone
[1221.60 --> 1222.60]  I'm not alone
[1222.60 --> 1223.60]  I'm not alone
[1223.60 --> 1224.60]  I'm not alone
[1224.60 --> 1225.60]  I'm not alone
[1225.60 --> 1226.60]  I'm not alone
[1226.60 --> 1228.60]  I'm not alone
[1228.60 --> 1229.60]  I'm not alone
[1229.60 --> 1230.60]  With your presence
[1230.60 --> 1234.60]  I'll watch away
[1234.60 --> 1238.60]  Watch away
[1238.60 --> 1242.60]  What is I?
[1242.60 --> 1243.60]  How is I?
[1243.60 --> 1245.60]  How does I?
[1245.60 --> 1247.60]  How does I?
[1247.60 --> 1249.60]  How does it fit?
[1249.60 --> 1251.60]  Jesus
[1251.60 --> 1255.60]  How does it fit?
[1255.60 --> 1275.32]  Louisiana.
[1275.32 --> 1282.70]  Aleph and Padre from the earth
[1282.70 --> 1284.70]  J- Dartblims
[1312.70 --> 1321.70]  In your presence, all my fears are washed away, washed away.
[1324.04 --> 1330.70]  I was born, I was born, I was born.
[1331.32 --> 1338.70]  You are the Father, you see us, you are the Lord, you are the Lord, you are the Lord.
[1338.70 --> 1354.70]  Hosanna, Hosanna, I'm your one, you are the Lord, you are the Lord, you are the Lord.
[1354.70 --> 1370.70]  Hosanna, Hosanna, you are the Lord, you are the Lord, you are the Lord, you are the Lord.
[1370.70 --> 1386.70]  Hosanna, Hosanna, I'm your one, you are the Lord, you are the Lord, you are the Lord.
[1386.70 --> 1392.70]  Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna.
[1392.70 --> 1393.62]  Mays that a seat.
[1399.06 --> 1406.92]  Please join us in a prayer of confession this morning with the words taken from the prayer of Daniel in Daniel chapter 9.
[1406.92 --> 1415.66]  Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps his covenant of love with those who love him
[1415.66 --> 1423.42]  and keep his commandments, we have sinned and done wrong. We have been wicked and have rebelled.
[1423.72 --> 1431.28]  We have turned away from you. Lord, you are righteous, but this day we are covered with
[1431.28 --> 1438.78]  shame because we have sinned against you. But you are the Lord, our God. You are merciful and
[1438.78 --> 1445.70]  forgiving, even though we have rebelled against you. We have not obeyed you, Lord, our God, or kept
[1445.70 --> 1455.86]  the laws you gave us. Please forgive us. We do not make requests of you, God, because we are righteous,
[1455.86 --> 1467.84]  but because of your great mercy. Lord, listen. Lord, forgive. Lord, hear and act. For your sake,
[1467.84 --> 1477.72]  our God, do not delay, because we, your people, bear your name. Amen. Please stand as we sing together
[1477.72 --> 1482.60]  these songs of assurance and forgiveness that we have in our Savior, Jesus Christ.
[1485.86 --> 1514.18]  Lord, is gracious and compassionate. So do anger and let you know. Lord, is gracious and compassionate.
[1514.18 --> 1532.18]  Lord, is gracious and compassionate. So do anger and let you know. And the Lord is good to all. He has compassion
[1532.18 --> 1552.18]  as far as He is. As far as He is, He is from the West, and so far. He has revealed our transgressions from us.
[1552.18 --> 1566.18]  As far as He is, He is from the West, and so far. He has revealed our transgressions from us.
[1566.18 --> 1586.18]  Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[1586.18 --> 1594.18]  Oh, my soul, my soul, praise the Lord.
[1598.18 --> 1610.18]  The Lord is gracious and compassionate. So do anger and let you know.
[1610.18 --> 1624.18]  The Lord is gracious and compassionate. So do anger and let you know.
[1624.18 --> 1632.18]  The Lord is good to all. He has compassion.
[1632.18 --> 1634.18]  And now, He has compassion.
[1634.18 --> 1636.18]  God, He has compassion.
[1636.18 --> 1638.18]  God, He has compassion.
[1638.18 --> 1640.18]  And now, He has compassion.
[1640.18 --> 1644.18]  The Lord is gracious and compassionate. So do anger and let you know.
[1644.18 --> 1648.18]  As far as He is, He is from the West, and so far.
[1648.18 --> 1652.18]  He has remembered his blessings from us.
[1652.18 --> 1654.18]  If He is from the West, and so far.
[1654.18 --> 1684.16]  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, praise the Lord.
[1684.18 --> 1693.94]  Praise the Lord, oh my soul, praise the Lord.
[1696.94 --> 1708.58]  Praise the Lord, oh my soul, praise the Lord.
[1708.58 --> 1720.76]  Praise the Lord, oh my soul.
[1720.76 --> 1725.58]  Praise the Lord.
[1725.58 --> 1737.58]  Praise the Lord.
[1737.58 --> 1741.76]  You were the word at the beginning.
[1741.76 --> 1751.04]  One with God the Lord must have.
[1751.04 --> 1757.78]  Your hidden glory in creation.
[1759.36 --> 1765.46]  Now revealed in you, our Christ.
[1765.46 --> 1769.46]  What a beautiful name it is.
[1769.46 --> 1773.20]  What a beautiful name it is.
[1773.64 --> 1779.80]  The name of Jesus Christ my King.
[1780.80 --> 1784.68]  What a beautiful name it is.
[1785.22 --> 1788.20]  Nothing compares to this.
[1788.20 --> 1791.68]  What a beautiful name it is.
[1791.88 --> 1795.38]  The name of Jesus.
[1795.38 --> 1801.38]  Jesus Christ my King.
[1801.38 --> 1806.48]  You are heaven alone.
[1807.56 --> 1814.38]  Jesus you are heaven alone.
[1814.38 --> 1821.38]  What a beautiful name it is.
[1821.38 --> 1828.38]  The name of Jesus Christ my King.
[1828.38 --> 1831.38]  What a beautiful name it is.
[1831.38 --> 1834.38]  What a beautiful name it is.
[1834.38 --> 1841.38]  The name of Jesus Christ my King.
[1841.38 --> 1846.38]  What a beautiful name it is.
[1846.38 --> 1848.38]  What a beautiful name it is.
[1848.38 --> 1852.38]  What a beautiful name it is.
[1852.38 --> 1858.38]  What a beautiful name it is.
[1858.38 --> 1875.82]  What a beautiful name it is.
[1875.82 --> 1894.64]  When I called you
[1894.64 --> 1897.90]  The veil to be for you
[1897.90 --> 1900.62]  Your silence suffers
[1900.62 --> 1904.34]  Of sin and grace
[1904.34 --> 1907.44]  The heavens are rolling
[1907.44 --> 1911.00]  The praise of your glory
[1911.00 --> 1917.34]  For you are raised to life again
[1917.34 --> 1920.90]  You have your right
[1920.90 --> 1924.52]  You have your equal
[1924.52 --> 1927.96]  I like your heaven
[1927.96 --> 1931.24]  The King reign
[1931.24 --> 1934.24]  Yours is the King
[1934.24 --> 1937.62]  Yours is the King
[1937.62 --> 1940.34]  Yours is the King
[1940.34 --> 1940.90]  Yours is the King
[1940.90 --> 1943.90]  Our love of peace
[1943.90 --> 1947.34]  What a powerful name it is
[1947.34 --> 1951.52]  What a powerful name it is
[1951.52 --> 1958.18]  The name of Jesus Christ my King
[1958.18 --> 1961.62]  What a powerful name it is
[1961.62 --> 1964.76]  Nothing can stand against
[1964.76 --> 1967.52]  What a powerful name it is
[1967.52 --> 1971.18]  The name of Jesus
[1972.18 --> 1973.80]  You have youribles
[1973.80 --> 1978.18]  You have your Wikile
[1978.18 --> 1981.90]  Now and forever
[1981.90 --> 1984.18]  God you reign
[1984.18 --> 1987.18]  Yours is the King
[1987.28 --> 1988.46]  Yours is the Pennsylvania
[1988.46 --> 1991.34]  Yours is the glory
[1991.34 --> 1998.36]  Yours is the name of the Lord raised
[1998.36 --> 2001.70]  What a powerful name it is
[2001.70 --> 2005.04]  What a powerful name it is
[2005.04 --> 2009.48]  The name of Jesus Christ
[2009.48 --> 2015.26]  What a powerful name it is
[2015.26 --> 2018.30]  You have been blessed and blessed
[2018.30 --> 2021.48]  What a powerful name it is
[2021.48 --> 2024.88]  The name of Jesus
[2024.88 --> 2028.36]  What a wonderful name it is
[2028.36 --> 2031.94]  The name of Jesus
[2031.94 --> 2035.70]  What a beautiful name it is
[2035.70 --> 2039.56]  The name of Jesus
[2039.56 --> 2045.46]  You may have a seat.
[2048.30 --> 2057.74]  At this time in our worship together
[2057.74 --> 2062.04]  We're going to celebrate God's gift of faith
[2062.04 --> 2064.54]  In the life of a couple of our people
[2064.54 --> 2066.38]  One of them is Levi so I'll put this up here
[2066.38 --> 2070.28]  That seems right
[2070.28 --> 2073.84]  And part of how we do that in this church
[2073.84 --> 2077.06]  Is by inviting these people to come up
[2077.06 --> 2079.86]  And to share a little bit of their faith stories
[2079.86 --> 2082.98]  To share a little bit about how they see God at work
[2082.98 --> 2087.18]  In their lives and through our church family together
[2087.18 --> 2091.48]  And then to invite someone who has mentored them
[2091.48 --> 2094.00]  Or discipled them or been influential
[2094.00 --> 2097.84]  In God rearing faith in their life
[2097.84 --> 2102.32]  And so today we're going to hear both from Levi and Sean
[2102.32 --> 2103.50]  Who are doing profession of faith
[2103.50 --> 2107.20]  And from two people who have spoken God's truth
[2107.20 --> 2109.18]  And modeled that for them
[2109.18 --> 2113.76]  I love this tradition of our church
[2113.76 --> 2116.28]  And it fits really in with the series
[2116.28 --> 2118.26]  That we're in the midst of here for the summer
[2118.26 --> 2120.34]  Which is Faith Heroes
[2120.34 --> 2125.16]  Talking about how sharing how God is at work in our lives
[2125.16 --> 2129.12]  Fuels God's work in other people's lives
[2129.12 --> 2131.74]  Because we hear that and we see God at work
[2131.74 --> 2134.68]  And sometimes when we are in the dark night of our own soul
[2134.68 --> 2136.96]  Sometimes when we are walking through the valley
[2136.96 --> 2137.92]  Of the shadow of death
[2137.92 --> 2143.56]  Sometimes when we are just feeling crushed and beat down
[2143.56 --> 2148.26]  It's the stories of other people that buoy our faith
[2148.26 --> 2149.74]  That lift us back up
[2149.74 --> 2153.14]  And so we're grateful for that chance to share this morning
[2153.14 --> 2157.60]  Levi, I'm going to invite you to the front first
[2157.60 --> 2160.50]  Levi's going to share a little bit himself
[2160.50 --> 2164.06]  And then we'll have Pastor Kevin come up after that
[2164.06 --> 2170.92]  Not this
[2170.92 --> 2174.76]  We'll just go with it
[2174.76 --> 2178.70]  You can take it out too
[2178.70 --> 2180.42]  I'll take it out when that works too
[2180.42 --> 2182.64]  Before I begin
[2182.64 --> 2183.96]  I would just like to bring to your attention
[2183.96 --> 2185.96]  That we are now accepting skilled applicants
[2185.96 --> 2187.96]  To fill in the position as a media assistant
[2187.96 --> 2188.86]  For the back booth
[2188.86 --> 2191.92]  Please submit your resumes
[2191.92 --> 2193.98]  To my wonderful manager Linda Stam
[2193.98 --> 2195.86]  Or myself following the service
[2195.86 --> 2197.90]  No past work experience required
[2197.90 --> 2200.66]  Benefits include the occasional Tim Horton's gift card
[2200.66 --> 2203.92]  Now we'll begin
[2203.92 --> 2205.90]  Before I attended
[2205.90 --> 2207.54]  The first pastor's class
[2207.54 --> 2209.48]  I would have not thought I would be standing here right now
[2209.48 --> 2211.88]  I thought I was not quite ready or prepared
[2211.88 --> 2213.90]  Because I have too many unanswered questions
[2213.90 --> 2216.86]  I will be attending Redeemer University this fall
[2216.86 --> 2218.60]  And it initially made sense to me
[2218.60 --> 2220.60]  To do my profession of faith
[2220.60 --> 2221.94]  After my first year
[2221.94 --> 2224.60]  For my foundation and my faith will grow
[2224.60 --> 2226.56]  And many of my questions will be sorted out
[2226.56 --> 2229.52]  However, one realization I've learned
[2229.52 --> 2230.54]  Through pastor's class
[2230.54 --> 2232.20]  And a good conversation with Pastor Chris
[2232.20 --> 2234.40]  Was no one has all their questions answered
[2234.40 --> 2236.46]  And not everyone's foundations are the same
[2236.46 --> 2238.42]  While in the midst of the course
[2238.42 --> 2241.12]  Multiple questions I have wondered once in my life
[2241.12 --> 2243.48]  Seem to all make a reappearance all at once
[2243.48 --> 2245.78]  With these questions swirling in my head
[2245.78 --> 2248.18]  It caused me to think that I could not profess my faith
[2248.18 --> 2251.08]  I'm just not there, I'd convince myself
[2251.08 --> 2253.38]  Yet I have reassured that I will have time
[2253.38 --> 2254.42]  To find my answers
[2254.42 --> 2257.08]  Questions and seeking these answers
[2257.08 --> 2258.98]  My relationship with the Lord will prosper
[2258.98 --> 2261.70]  In order to process your faith
[2261.70 --> 2263.84]  You need to act like you have it all figured out
[2263.84 --> 2267.30]  You don't need to act like you have it all figured out
[2267.30 --> 2269.38]  Pastor Chris puts it best
[2269.38 --> 2271.74]  Every topic ever discussed in Christianity
[2271.74 --> 2273.16]  Fits in a layer of a circle
[2273.16 --> 2275.20]  But in the center of the circle, the core
[2275.20 --> 2278.22]  Is the belief that God is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
[2278.22 --> 2280.72]  When one comes to fully accept that
[2280.72 --> 2281.36]  They are ready
[2281.36 --> 2284.74]  In Matthew 16, chapter 16, verse 24
[2284.74 --> 2285.20]  It reads
[2285.20 --> 2286.98]  Then Jesus said to his disciples
[2286.98 --> 2288.76]  Whoever wants to be my disciple
[2288.76 --> 2290.88]  Must deny themselves and carry their cross
[2290.88 --> 2291.70]  And follow me
[2291.70 --> 2294.10]  Many impactful moments in my faith journey
[2294.10 --> 2295.54]  Include youth conferences
[2295.54 --> 2297.16]  And events
[2297.16 --> 2299.02]  Conversation with leaders in this church
[2299.02 --> 2301.60]  My Spring Mexico missions trip last year
[2301.60 --> 2303.80]  Kids summer Bible camp at school
[2303.80 --> 2305.62]  And a few more unmentioned
[2305.62 --> 2307.24]  I'm extremely grateful
[2307.24 --> 2310.74]  For the noticed and unnoticed moments
[2310.74 --> 2311.98]  That God has worked through me
[2311.98 --> 2313.88]  So despite all my questioning
[2313.88 --> 2315.58]  I do not doubt that there is a God
[2315.58 --> 2316.44]  Who is three in one
[2316.44 --> 2318.62]  And I'm glad to be walking alongside him further
[2318.62 --> 2320.36]  While carrying my cross
[2320.36 --> 2321.18]  Thank you
[2321.18 --> 2333.54]  You can come a little closer
[2333.54 --> 2336.38]  Levi, it's good to see you up here, man
[2336.38 --> 2338.14]  I'm super pumped for today
[2338.14 --> 2339.56]  I'm excited for you and Sean
[2339.56 --> 2341.14]  And for this day
[2341.14 --> 2342.78]  You've been coming to this church all your life
[2342.78 --> 2345.18]  And I've known you now for 15 years
[2345.18 --> 2347.10]  And especially the last five years
[2347.10 --> 2348.52]  As you've been sort of journeying
[2348.52 --> 2349.96]  Through this youth ministry together
[2349.96 --> 2352.06]  We've done trips to Alberta together
[2352.06 --> 2354.80]  You've helped me out at Reactivate over the years
[2354.80 --> 2356.66]  And you and Connor are still the only two youth
[2356.66 --> 2358.64]  Who have led kangaroo court at youth camp
[2358.64 --> 2359.48]  Throughout its history
[2359.48 --> 2361.12]  And through all of this time
[2361.12 --> 2362.34]  You've been faithful
[2362.34 --> 2363.40]  You've been present
[2363.40 --> 2364.66]  And you've been there
[2364.66 --> 2367.26]  You grew from this awkward grade 8 boy
[2367.26 --> 2368.44]  At the beginning of youth
[2368.44 --> 2370.08]  And now you're this awkward man
[2370.08 --> 2371.48]  Who's graduated from youth
[2371.48 --> 2374.04]  And you're off to Redeemer
[2374.04 --> 2376.36]  And as life continues on
[2376.36 --> 2378.46]  As you move forward from today
[2378.46 --> 2380.04]  As you move forward from professing your faith
[2380.04 --> 2381.12]  In front of everyone here
[2381.12 --> 2382.82]  I want you just to hear this verse
[2382.82 --> 2384.18]  From 2 Corinthians 5
[2384.18 --> 2385.18]  Verses 20-21
[2385.18 --> 2385.64]  It says
[2385.64 --> 2388.14]  We are therefore Christ's ambassadors
[2388.14 --> 2390.62]  As though God were making his appeal through us
[2390.62 --> 2393.64]  We implore you on Christ's behalf
[2393.64 --> 2395.56]  Be reconciled to God
[2395.56 --> 2398.46]  God made him who had no sin to be sin for us
[2398.46 --> 2399.78]  So that in him
[2399.78 --> 2402.46]  We might become the righteousness of God
[2402.46 --> 2403.56]  Now an ambassador of course
[2403.56 --> 2405.68]  Is a resident of one country or a kingdom
[2405.68 --> 2407.78]  But who lives in a different country
[2407.78 --> 2408.58]  In a foreign country
[2408.58 --> 2410.64]  And speaks on behalf of the country
[2410.64 --> 2411.80]  That he is a member of
[2411.80 --> 2412.74]  Or they are a member of
[2412.74 --> 2415.66]  So as ambassadors of Christ
[2415.66 --> 2418.60]  We get to live out on this earth
[2418.60 --> 2421.02]  As though we are already part of God's kingdom
[2421.02 --> 2422.80]  And that is what you are professing today
[2422.80 --> 2425.02]  And Levi you've been doing this well here
[2425.02 --> 2426.50]  You've been doing this in this community
[2426.50 --> 2427.34]  In this church
[2427.34 --> 2428.86]  Throughout our youth ministry
[2428.86 --> 2429.58]  Throughout the community
[2429.58 --> 2431.40]  That you've been a part of at LCS as well
[2431.40 --> 2433.64]  And I want to encourage you to keep that up
[2433.64 --> 2435.06]  As you go forward from this day
[2435.06 --> 2435.90]  And into Ontario
[2435.90 --> 2438.92]  Don't change from your fun-loving
[2438.92 --> 2440.32]  Clearly confident
[2440.32 --> 2441.68]  Bougie-seeking
[2441.68 --> 2443.40]  Movie-consuming self
[2443.40 --> 2445.78]  But more importantly
[2445.78 --> 2447.44]  Don't change from your pursuit of Christ
[2447.44 --> 2449.18]  From who he is
[2449.18 --> 2451.02]  From what he has done for you
[2451.02 --> 2452.34]  From how you are called to live
[2452.34 --> 2453.48]  And even from all the questions
[2453.48 --> 2454.64]  That you still might have
[2454.64 --> 2456.04]  Don't flee from those
[2456.04 --> 2456.96]  But press into that
[2456.96 --> 2458.08]  Knowing who Christ is
[2458.08 --> 2459.54]  And what he has done for you
[2459.54 --> 2461.34]  Remember what you're professing here today
[2461.34 --> 2462.54]  That Christ is Lord
[2462.54 --> 2463.68]  Over all things in your life
[2463.68 --> 2464.60]  Your social life
[2464.60 --> 2465.50]  Your studies
[2465.50 --> 2466.52]  Your extracurriculars
[2466.52 --> 2467.70]  What you choose to consume
[2467.70 --> 2469.12]  Christ is Lord over all of that
[2469.12 --> 2472.48]  Be reconciled to him
[2472.48 --> 2473.86]  And continue to be his ambassador
[2473.86 --> 2474.88]  Wherever God leads you
[2474.88 --> 2475.92]  When you come back from Ontario
[2475.92 --> 2477.52]  Whether that's at Christmas or summer
[2477.52 --> 2479.50]  You better be ready for breakfast with me
[2479.50 --> 2480.10]  Yeah?
[2480.58 --> 2480.84]  Alright
[2480.84 --> 2481.46]  Love you man
[2481.46 --> 2492.50]  Thanks guys
[2492.50 --> 2494.04]  Levi just have a seat somewhere in the front
[2494.04 --> 2497.52]  Next I want to invite Sean
[2497.52 --> 2499.84]  Sean where
[2499.84 --> 2500.50]  There you are
[2500.50 --> 2501.04]  Thank you
[2501.04 --> 2503.04]  Sean's going to come up to the front
[2503.04 --> 2504.40]  And then after Sean
[2504.40 --> 2505.34]  Haley
[2505.34 --> 2506.50]  You can just make your way up
[2506.50 --> 2509.58]  Thank you
[2524.04 --> 2527.24]  There we go
[2527.24 --> 2530.38]  My testimony is pretty similar
[2530.38 --> 2531.22]  To a lot of people
[2531.22 --> 2533.36]  Christian family
[2533.36 --> 2534.08]  Church
[2534.08 --> 2534.98]  School
[2534.98 --> 2536.04]  And now
[2536.04 --> 2537.10]  Christian university
[2537.10 --> 2538.52]  But
[2538.52 --> 2539.68]  I like to
[2539.68 --> 2541.68]  Well the one thing I've learned
[2541.68 --> 2542.56]  Is that
[2542.56 --> 2544.90]  Your faith cannot be forced
[2544.90 --> 2546.74]  It's a choice that you make every day
[2546.74 --> 2548.34]  Which I think is pretty awesome
[2548.34 --> 2549.88]  And
[2549.88 --> 2551.70]  It's kind of ironic
[2551.70 --> 2553.44]  Because I've had a really
[2553.44 --> 2554.66]  Christian life
[2554.66 --> 2555.62]  But
[2555.62 --> 2556.70]  It seems kind of forced
[2556.70 --> 2557.32]  But it's not
[2557.32 --> 2560.00]  And I would just like to encourage
[2560.00 --> 2561.60]  The younger
[2561.60 --> 2563.04]  Members of this church
[2563.04 --> 2564.04]  To make your faith your own
[2564.04 --> 2565.36]  And to
[2565.36 --> 2568.00]  Take initiative in your faith
[2568.00 --> 2569.76]  Thank you
[2579.88 --> 2597.40]  Hi
[2597.40 --> 2602.22]  I'm not as well practiced as Kevin
[2602.22 --> 2603.34]  So bear with me
[2603.34 --> 2605.28]  I'm Haley
[2605.28 --> 2606.86]  I'm Sean's big sister
[2606.86 --> 2608.98]  Although lately I've been feeling
[2608.98 --> 2610.22]  More like a little one
[2610.22 --> 2612.96]  As Sean's sister I've had
[2612.96 --> 2615.08]  Thanks Kevin
[2615.08 --> 2618.62]  As Sean's sister I've had the joy
[2618.62 --> 2619.88]  Of watching Sean grow up
[2619.88 --> 2620.84]  And now I'm here
[2620.84 --> 2622.26]  At his profession of faith
[2622.26 --> 2623.84]  Watching him make the very
[2623.84 --> 2624.90]  Grown up decision to
[2624.90 --> 2626.60]  Commit himself to loving the Lord
[2626.60 --> 2627.78]  For the rest of his life
[2627.78 --> 2628.88]  Sean
[2628.88 --> 2631.44]  I'm incredibly proud of who you have become
[2631.44 --> 2633.96]  Though it really happened in the blink of an eye
[2633.96 --> 2636.94]  You've always been the quietest of us kids
[2636.94 --> 2637.98]  Thank goodness
[2637.98 --> 2639.30]  I don't think mom and dad
[2639.30 --> 2640.50]  Could handle another kid
[2640.50 --> 2641.76]  That never stops talking
[2641.76 --> 2644.64]  But when I am lucky enough
[2644.64 --> 2645.56]  To hear your thoughts
[2645.56 --> 2646.74]  They are always funny
[2646.74 --> 2647.52]  Insightful
[2647.52 --> 2648.30]  Or uplifting
[2648.30 --> 2650.26]  I pray that as you enter
[2650.26 --> 2651.46]  This next phase of life
[2651.46 --> 2653.12]  You keep that thoughtfulness
[2653.12 --> 2654.88]  And careful way of speaking about you
[2654.88 --> 2657.60]  This year you did seem to open up
[2657.60 --> 2659.18]  And develop some wonderful friendships
[2659.18 --> 2660.90]  With people that encourage your faith
[2660.90 --> 2663.30]  You participated in a bible study
[2663.30 --> 2664.40]  With your friends at school
[2664.40 --> 2666.12]  And decided to attend
[2666.12 --> 2667.70]  A Christian university in the fall
[2667.70 --> 2669.26]  Even though a lot of your friends
[2669.26 --> 2670.40]  Are going other places
[2670.40 --> 2671.92]  I have witnessed you
[2671.92 --> 2673.28]  Continuously make choices
[2673.28 --> 2674.86]  Just as you were talking about
[2674.86 --> 2677.02]  That support your relationship with God
[2677.02 --> 2678.08]  Both on your own
[2678.08 --> 2679.94]  And with the help of others in your life
[2680.18 --> 2682.48]  It is clear that your faith is your own
[2682.48 --> 2684.00]  And is something that you nurture
[2684.00 --> 2686.92]  So before you leave me all alone in BC
[2686.92 --> 2689.42]  I want to leave you with an encouragement
[2689.42 --> 2691.90]  From Colossians 2 verse 6 to 7
[2691.90 --> 2693.50]  It says
[2693.50 --> 2696.58]  So then just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord
[2696.58 --> 2698.44]  Continue to live your life in him
[2698.44 --> 2700.08]  Rooted and built up in him
[2700.08 --> 2702.18]  Strengthened in the faith as you were taught
[2702.18 --> 2704.06]  And overflowing with thankfulness
[2704.06 --> 2706.14]  Sean I love being your sister
[2706.14 --> 2708.24]  And I know what the Lord has in store for you
[2708.24 --> 2708.98]  Will be wonderful
[2708.98 --> 2710.72]  And I can't wait to watch it happen
[2710.72 --> 2726.72]  As mentioned
[2726.72 --> 2728.90]  This morning we are celebrating
[2728.90 --> 2730.36]  Your profession of faith
[2730.36 --> 2732.66]  Profession of faith
[2732.66 --> 2733.72]  Marks
[2733.72 --> 2737.20]  A step on a journey of God's promise
[2737.20 --> 2738.98]  That was spoken to these two
[2738.98 --> 2740.46]  At their baptism
[2740.46 --> 2742.62]  I want to put a picture on the screen
[2742.62 --> 2748.54]  Levi and Sean were baptized together
[2748.54 --> 2750.50]  In this church
[2750.50 --> 2753.56]  Today they make profession of faith together
[2753.56 --> 2754.88]  In this church
[2754.88 --> 2757.30]  I want you to see this picture
[2757.30 --> 2759.96]  Because I believe it is a testimony of two things
[2759.96 --> 2761.56]  First and foremost
[2761.56 --> 2762.94]  God's faithfulness
[2762.94 --> 2764.64]  At their baptism
[2764.64 --> 2766.92]  God made a promise to them
[2766.92 --> 2769.62]  And we responded to that promise
[2769.62 --> 2772.64]  And we see God continuing
[2772.64 --> 2774.36]  To be faithful to his promise
[2774.36 --> 2777.32]  As you two now stand here today
[2777.32 --> 2779.08]  Additionally
[2779.08 --> 2780.88]  The second thing we see
[2780.88 --> 2782.20]  Is a church community
[2782.20 --> 2784.00]  That has surrounded you
[2784.00 --> 2784.92]  And prayed for you
[2784.92 --> 2786.28]  We saw evidence of that
[2786.28 --> 2788.12]  That's you guys
[2788.12 --> 2789.70]  Who back then
[2789.70 --> 2791.72]  Promised to pray
[2791.72 --> 2794.20]  For these two boys
[2794.20 --> 2796.06]  To encourage them
[2796.06 --> 2797.06]  And to support them
[2797.06 --> 2799.24]  And to love their families
[2799.24 --> 2800.96]  And we see the fruit
[2800.96 --> 2802.54]  Of that labor in the Lord
[2802.54 --> 2804.64]  For we know that our labor in the Lord
[2804.64 --> 2805.52]  Is not in vain
[2805.52 --> 2806.26]  And today
[2806.26 --> 2807.72]  You guys help us
[2807.72 --> 2809.56]  See that more clearly
[2809.56 --> 2810.88]  And so thank you
[2810.88 --> 2812.14]  And congratulations
[2812.14 --> 2814.04]  I'm going to invite you up to the front
[2814.04 --> 2816.66]  Take a spot here on the stage
[2816.66 --> 2819.56]  I'm going to ask you
[2819.56 --> 2821.00]  Four questions
[2821.00 --> 2823.82]  And then I will ask them all in one shot
[2823.82 --> 2824.90]  And then I'll ask you individually
[2824.90 --> 2826.08]  What is your answer
[2826.08 --> 2827.32]  You can say
[2827.32 --> 2828.20]  I do
[2828.20 --> 2829.16]  With God's help
[2829.16 --> 2829.84]  Or I do
[2829.84 --> 2830.74]  God helping me
[2830.74 --> 2832.92]  However you choose to answer
[2832.92 --> 2833.78]  We'll be fine
[2833.78 --> 2836.24]  Kevin's going to pass the microphone to you
[2836.24 --> 2837.12]  So that he can say it
[2837.12 --> 2837.80]  Into the microphone
[2837.80 --> 2839.10]  So that this time
[2839.10 --> 2840.16]  You can be heard
[2840.16 --> 2841.60]  Did one of you cry at your baptism?
[2843.60 --> 2844.46]  Any parents?
[2844.46 --> 2846.00]  Not your baby
[2846.00 --> 2846.28]  Nope
[2846.28 --> 2849.22]  So I did cry?
[2852.68 --> 2854.92]  So be louder than you were
[2854.92 --> 2855.72]  At your baptism
[2855.72 --> 2856.84]  When you say
[2856.84 --> 2857.26]  I do
[2857.26 --> 2858.02]  With God's help
[2858.02 --> 2860.42]  So
[2860.42 --> 2861.06]  Questions
[2861.06 --> 2863.10]  Do you believe
[2863.10 --> 2864.48]  That Jesus Christ
[2864.48 --> 2865.72]  Is the Son of God
[2865.72 --> 2867.08]  Sent to redeem the world?
[2867.58 --> 2868.18]  Do you trust
[2868.18 --> 2868.90]  And love
[2868.90 --> 2869.36]  Him
[2869.36 --> 2870.16]  As the one
[2870.16 --> 2870.96]  Who saves you
[2870.96 --> 2871.68]  From your sin?
[2872.12 --> 2872.74]  And do you
[2872.74 --> 2873.54]  With repentance
[2873.54 --> 2874.24]  And joy
[2874.24 --> 2875.20]  Embrace Him
[2875.20 --> 2876.58]  As Lord of your life?
[2877.44 --> 2877.74]  Two
[2877.74 --> 2879.10]  Do you believe
[2879.10 --> 2879.66]  That the Bible
[2879.66 --> 2880.88]  Is the word of God
[2880.88 --> 2881.82]  Revealing Christ
[2881.82 --> 2882.56]  And His redemption
[2882.56 --> 2883.96]  And that the confessions
[2883.96 --> 2885.00]  Of this church
[2885.00 --> 2886.36]  Faithfully reflect
[2886.36 --> 2887.26]  This revelation?
[2888.68 --> 2888.88]  Three
[2888.88 --> 2890.48]  Do you accept
[2890.48 --> 2891.48]  The gracious promises
[2891.48 --> 2892.00]  Of God
[2892.00 --> 2892.90]  Sealed to you
[2892.90 --> 2894.14]  In your baptism
[2894.14 --> 2895.22]  And do you affirm
[2895.22 --> 2895.94]  Your union
[2895.94 --> 2896.68]  With Christ
[2896.68 --> 2897.36]  And His church
[2897.36 --> 2898.52]  Which your baptism
[2898.52 --> 2899.26]  Signifies?
[2900.28 --> 2900.84]  And then four
[2900.84 --> 2902.24]  Do you promise
[2902.24 --> 2903.32]  To do all that you can
[2903.32 --> 2903.80]  With the help
[2903.80 --> 2904.62]  Of the Holy Spirit
[2904.62 --> 2905.32]  To strengthen
[2905.32 --> 2905.94]  Your love
[2905.94 --> 2906.46]  And commitment
[2906.46 --> 2906.98]  To Christ
[2906.98 --> 2907.88]  By sharing
[2907.88 --> 2908.48]  Faithfully
[2908.48 --> 2909.12]  In the life
[2909.12 --> 2909.72]  Of the church
[2909.72 --> 2910.74]  Honoring
[2910.74 --> 2911.28]  And submitting
[2911.28 --> 2912.10]  To its authority
[2912.10 --> 2912.90]  And do you
[2912.90 --> 2913.78]  Join with the people
[2913.78 --> 2914.22]  Of God
[2914.22 --> 2914.70]  In doing
[2914.70 --> 2915.42]  The work
[2915.42 --> 2916.04]  Of the Lord
[2916.04 --> 2916.96]  Everywhere?
[2917.82 --> 2918.04]  Levi
[2918.04 --> 2919.18]  What is your answer?
[2919.74 --> 2920.08]  I do
[2920.08 --> 2920.84]  With God's help
[2920.84 --> 2922.62]  Sean
[2922.62 --> 2923.66]  What is your answer?
[2923.90 --> 2924.24]  I do
[2924.24 --> 2925.04]  With God's help
[2925.04 --> 2926.14]  Amen
[2926.14 --> 2927.54]  In the name
[2927.54 --> 2928.14]  Of our Lord
[2928.14 --> 2929.10]  Jesus Christ
[2929.10 --> 2930.02]  I now welcome
[2930.02 --> 2931.26]  You to the privileges
[2931.26 --> 2933.18]  Of full communion
[2933.18 --> 2934.80]  I welcome you
[2934.80 --> 2937.04]  To participation
[2937.04 --> 2937.98]  In the life
[2937.98 --> 2938.64]  Of the church
[2938.64 --> 2939.68]  I welcome you
[2939.68 --> 2940.56]  To its responsibilities
[2940.56 --> 2942.12]  And its joys
[2942.12 --> 2943.70]  And its sufferings
[2943.70 --> 2944.94]  May the God
[2944.94 --> 2945.48]  Of peace
[2945.48 --> 2946.42]  Who through the blood

[3571.38 --> 3575.72]  My name is John. I'm one of the elders in the church here, and I'd like to lead you in our
[3575.72 --> 3584.20]  congregational prayer. Oh, Lord God, creator of the world, creator of the universe, Lord, we give you
[3584.20 --> 3591.82]  the honor and praise and glory that is due your name. You are the one who set this whole world in
[3591.82 --> 3600.04]  place, and put us on this world. You put us on this world to serve you, to give you the honor that is
[3600.04 --> 3608.62]  due your name. Lord, we come before you as broken people, people who are sinful, who do not deserve
[3608.62 --> 3616.12]  to be here. But Lord, you have given us your grace, your peace, that you have given us the opportunity
[3616.12 --> 3624.20]  to worship you. You've put that into our hearts. Lord, that we can truly be thankful for the many
[3624.20 --> 3630.74]  blessings you have given to us as believers. Lord, we're thankful for the professional faith
[3630.74 --> 3637.64]  that we could see from Levi and Sean this morning. Lord, a continued sign of your blessing for the new
[3637.64 --> 3645.50]  members in our congregation. Lord, may you bless us as we live our lives each day, that we may be a
[3645.50 --> 3654.42]  blessing to those in the community around us. Lord, we have many needs in our congregation. Lord,
[3654.46 --> 3661.44]  we have programs that are starting up again in the fall with many positions to be filled. Lord,
[3661.52 --> 3668.82]  we ask a blessing on each person whose heart is opened up to be able to serve, or whether that be in
[3668.82 --> 3676.50]  in council, in council, leading children's worship time, teaching gems and cadets, coffee break, other
[3676.50 --> 3684.24]  ministries. Lord, these are outpourings of our heart for our love for you, and we pray that you may be able
[3684.24 --> 3692.04]  to fill those positions, that we may be a blessing to others. Lord, many in our congregation have
[3692.04 --> 3697.82]  sufferings and difficulties that are dealing with. Lord, whether they be present members or former,
[3697.82 --> 3703.56]  we think of Amy Cron and the fact that she is dealing with cancer. We pray that you may bless her
[3703.56 --> 3709.26]  as she is home dealing with new treatment, that that may be effective for healing for her. We pray for
[3709.26 --> 3715.00]  John Kuypers, too, and the change of medication that he has had and difficulties dealing with that.
[3715.00 --> 3723.54]  Pray for a blessing for him that his pain may be able to reduce. We're thankful that Amy Bongers could
[3723.54 --> 3732.34]  have successful eye surgery, that she can see well again. Lord, we're thankful for Warren and Melanie
[3732.34 --> 3738.06]  Verhoof, members who have been coming to our church more recently. They were blessed with a baby girl,
[3738.06 --> 3744.40]  Georgia, a week ago. We pray a blessing for that family as they welcome that new one into their lives.
[3745.00 --> 3756.18]  Lord, our world is continuing to be beset by natural disasters. There's many that we see flooding
[3756.18 --> 3763.16]  in areas that receive too much rain and areas like our part of the country where we have not have
[3763.16 --> 3771.18]  enough rain and we see lots of fires, loss of homes and properties. Lord, we pray that your peace may be
[3771.18 --> 3784.18]  with those who come with those difficulties and have to rebuild their lives. Lord, we pray for comfort for those who have lost loved ones in fires and disasters.
[3784.18 --> 3798.18]  Lord, we pray for those families that have either marriage or family difficulties, relationship issues that are not going well. We pray that your peace may work in each one of these persons' lives.
[3798.18 --> 3813.18]  names that we will not put up here, but people who know who they are. That we as a congregation may be able to surround these families, these individuals and bless them with support.
[3813.18 --> 3815.18]  Lord, we pray for the outreach that we may be able to give to our community. Lord, whether that's in food bank issues, we pray for Pastor Chris and Josh and Kevin as they work with Trinity Western having an outreach program next week for new people coming to the Christian University.
[3815.18 --> 3845.16]  there. We may bless the
[3845.16 --> 3847.16]  efforts of the efforts of the Christian University.
[3847.16 --> 3863.16]  efforts of these three to introduce Christianity to the higher education world. We may be able to reach out to those members as well. We pray for those students who are going to college or some far away. We pray for a blessing for them as they take on this new stage in their lives.
[3863.16 --> 3865.16]  Lord, we ask a blessing on Josh as he is preaching for those of us.
[3865.16 --> 3877.16]  Lord, we ask a blessing on Josh as he preaches your word this morning. As he is preaching on heroes of faith that we may be blessed with the words that you are speaking through him.
[3877.16 --> 3891.16]  Lord, guide and lead us as we go into this new week. You may give us strength and conviction and purpose as we reach out to those in our neighborhood, those who we work with.
[3891.16 --> 3895.16]  That we may shine your light on those around us.
[3895.16 --> 3901.16]  Lord, we ask this not because we are worthy but in the name of your son Jesus Christ who died on the cross for us.
[3901.16 --> 3905.16]  This we ask in your name alone. Amen.
[3905.16 --> 3919.16]  Hello. Okay.
[3919.16 --> 3925.16]  So, to start, we are going to do a bit of Bible trivia.
[3925.16 --> 3929.16]  Because I like Bible trivia but also it is important for the sermon.
[3929.16 --> 3935.16]  So, who, there are only two people who have never died. Who are they?
[3935.16 --> 3938.16]  Enoch?
[3938.16 --> 3940.16]  Elijah?
[3940.16 --> 3943.16]  Elijah? There we go. Okay. Those are the correct answers.
[3943.16 --> 3945.16]  Awesome. Okay.
[3945.16 --> 3950.16]  Over the past few months, we have been preaching on the heroes of faith in Hebrews 11.
[3950.16 --> 3954.16]  We have been talking about figures like Moses, Noah, Joseph.
[3954.16 --> 3962.16]  And all these people are provided copious amounts of stories that we can read and see their life of faith, what they did, how they lived.
[3962.16 --> 3967.16]  And we get to emulate them in how they approached God.
[3967.16 --> 3971.16]  However, today, we are preaching on Enoch.
[3971.16 --> 3975.16]  And Enoch has a total of nine verses in the whole Bible.
[3975.16 --> 3978.16]  And half of them aren't even about his actual life.
[3978.16 --> 3981.16]  Only one of them tells us about his faith.
[3981.16 --> 3983.16]  And yet, it's included in Hebrews 11.
[3983.16 --> 3987.16]  The passage today is Hebrews 11, 5 to 6.
[3987.16 --> 3990.16]  And today, we're getting Lyndon Verkike to read the passage.
[3990.16 --> 3992.16]  Lyndon, do you want to come up?
[3992.16 --> 3997.16]  While he's coming up, get your Bibles open and follow along.
[3997.16 --> 3998.16]  Perfect.
[3998.16 --> 4010.16]  Hebrews 11, 5 and 6.
[4010.16 --> 4015.16]  By faith, Enoch was taken from this life, so that he did not experience death.
[4015.16 --> 4018.16]  He could not be found because God had taken him away.
[4018.16 --> 4022.16]  For before he was commended as one who pleased God.
[4022.16 --> 4025.16]  And without faith, it is impossible to please God.
[4025.16 --> 4034.16]  Because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.
[4034.16 --> 4035.16]  Perfect.
[4035.16 --> 4037.16]  Thanks, Lyndon.
[4037.16 --> 4038.16]  Okay.
[4038.16 --> 4047.16]  As read above by Lyndon, the key of Enoch's avoidance of death was that he walked with God.
[4047.16 --> 4052.16]  And to walk with God, you must seek him and believe that he exists.
[4052.16 --> 4058.16]  Enoch walked with his God, as the passage says, and was commended as one who pleased him as a result.
[4058.16 --> 4066.16]  And this is the point we have to get from Enoch's story that the author of Hebrews is trying to present.
[4066.16 --> 4071.16]  Without faith, it is impossible to please God.
[4071.16 --> 4075.16]  Without faith, it's impossible to please God.
[4075.16 --> 4078.16]  But how does he walk faithfully with God?
[4078.16 --> 4085.16]  Well, in his actual story in Genesis 5, 21 to 24, it tells us a little bit of his story.
[4085.16 --> 4086.16]  Let me read it.
[4086.16 --> 4091.16]  When Enoch had lived 65 years, he became the father of Methuselah.
[4091.16 --> 4099.16]  After he became the father of Methuselah, Enoch walked faithfully with God for 300 years and had other sons and daughters.
[4099.16 --> 4102.16]  Altogether, Enoch lived 365 years.
[4102.16 --> 4104.16]  Enoch walked faithfully with God.
[4104.16 --> 4107.16]  Then he was no more because God took him away.
[4107.16 --> 4115.16]  So, from this one passage we have about Enoch, all we learn was that he walked faithfully with God.
[4115.16 --> 4120.16]  There's no reason that he was particularly faithful, just that he was.
[4120.16 --> 4126.16]  There isn't anything about Enoch's life or what he did, just that he was faithful.
[4126.16 --> 4133.16]  That this always used to leave me wondering what he did, who he was.
[4133.16 --> 4145.16]  But in the writing, in writing this, I realized that of all the people in the Hebrew passage, he has the best descriptor other than Christ, of course.
[4145.16 --> 4152.16]  It doesn't list all his achievements or possessions, all the great miracles he performed, or the great speeches he gave.
[4152.16 --> 4154.16]  It doesn't tell you how good of a man he was.
[4154.16 --> 4159.16]  The only thing it gives us is that he walked faithfully with God.
[4159.16 --> 4162.16]  And I think that's the best way to be remembered.
[4162.16 --> 4174.16]  You know, when I die, which eventually will happen, I hope that I lived the kind of life that on my tombstone, it says, he walked faithfully with God.
[4174.16 --> 4182.16]  However, because of this lack of info we have to work with, Enoch as a historical figure is mysterious and interesting.
[4182.16 --> 4189.16]  Now, before we get into much, I want to warn you all, we are going to go all over the place in this sermon.
[4189.16 --> 4192.16]  And it's going to seem haphazard and confusing at times.
[4192.16 --> 4196.16]  But I promise you, this will all connect and there will be a payoff.
[4196.16 --> 4201.16]  We just can't avoid going to the places we will go because of Enoch's mysteriousness.
[4201.16 --> 4203.16]  So really blame Enoch, not me.
[4203.16 --> 4205.16]  He did this to us.
[4205.16 --> 4211.16]  That being said, our first step on this journey is the Book of Enoch.
[4211.16 --> 4219.16]  The books of Enoch, like some other texts and ancient writings, look like the Bible.
[4219.16 --> 4222.16]  They're written in the same styles, but they're not.
[4222.16 --> 4232.16]  They were made to mimic the styles of the writings and attributed to people that lived in the Bible, but way after those people had already died.
[4232.16 --> 4242.16]  So most of them were written in between 400 BC and 0 BC, the period between the last writing of the Old Testament and the beginning of Christ's life.
[4242.16 --> 4249.16]  But Enoch would have been 4,000 years before all this, and they attribute it to him.
[4249.16 --> 4257.16]  And so those writings, those groups of books that look like the Bible are called the Apocrypha and the Pseudopigrapha.
[4257.16 --> 4259.16]  First Enoch is in the Apocrypha.
[4259.16 --> 4262.16]  Enoch 2 to 5 is in the Pseudopigrapha.
[4262.16 --> 4273.16]  Now, some denominations consider them to be important, but no Christian church considers them to be inspired scripture.
[4273.16 --> 4277.16]  No church considers them to be fully biblical.
[4277.16 --> 4282.16]  Our Belgic Confession, section 6a, says this about the collection of writings.
[4282.16 --> 4288.16]  All of which the church may read and take instruction from, so far as they agree with the canonical books.
[4288.16 --> 4300.16]  But they are far from having such power and efficacy as that they may, as that we may from their testimony confirm any point of faith or the Christian religion.
[4300.16 --> 4305.16]  Much less detract from the authority of the other sacred books.
[4305.16 --> 4307.16]  In no way are these writings considered scripture.
[4307.16 --> 4314.16]  And in most ways, Christians should not seek them out to help us with our walk with Christ and our discipleship and spiritual formation.
[4314.16 --> 4322.16]  But they can be useful in the study of scripture as it helps us understand the life and times of the people we read about in scripture.
[4322.16 --> 4325.16]  And if they agree with scripture, it's good.
[4325.16 --> 4330.16]  And if they agree with scripture, it's because they were inspired by the portions of scripture already written.
[4330.16 --> 4340.16]  So, essentially these books are just fan fiction that helps students of theology and history to see what the people were like at the time and to understand them and the world.
[4340.16 --> 4347.16]  Regardless, the writings attributed to Enoch are not considered inspired scripture.
[4347.16 --> 4353.16]  Breathed out by the Holy Spirit for the use of exhortation, teaching, or rebuking.
[4353.16 --> 4355.16]  Well, at least not most of it.
[4355.16 --> 4359.16]  You see, interestingly, Jude quotes part of 1 Enoch.
[4359.16 --> 4364.16]  So, meaning that that piece of Enoch that he quotes is now inspired.
[4364.16 --> 4365.16]  It's now biblical.
[4365.16 --> 4372.16]  And it's the only other passage about Enoch that we get in the Bible that we learn anything about Enoch.
[4372.16 --> 4374.16]  And that part never happened.
[4374.16 --> 4377.16]  Because it wasn't written by him.
[4377.16 --> 4378.16]  It isn't real.
[4378.16 --> 4379.16]  It's not historical.
[4379.16 --> 4381.16]  But we'll get to Jude later.
[4381.16 --> 4382.16]  I need to describe it first.
[4382.16 --> 4392.16]  The book of Enoch describes the events of Genesis 6 where the sons of God who come down and have children with women in which give birth to the infamous Nephilim.
[4392.16 --> 4393.16]  I think a picture.
[4393.16 --> 4394.16]  Ooh, it's a bit dark.
[4394.16 --> 4395.16]  Okay.
[4395.16 --> 4396.16]  So, that's a picture of David fighting Goliath.
[4396.16 --> 4399.16]  Goliath is a descendant of the Nephilim.
[4399.16 --> 4408.16]  The Nephilim were angel-human hybrids, 16-foot-tall giants who were great warriors who committed horribly evil actions.
[4408.16 --> 4414.16]  The book describes the angels who do this by name, the book of Enoch, and about God's judgment of those angels.
[4414.16 --> 4419.16]  Now, before we continue, I just want to acknowledge what everyone's thinking right now.
[4419.16 --> 4421.16]  What I just said is weird.
[4421.16 --> 4422.16]  Crazy, even.
[4422.16 --> 4425.16]  The idea of a human angel child is weird.
[4425.16 --> 4429.16]  And every time we read about the Nephilim in Genesis 6, our minds just kind of go blank.
[4429.16 --> 4433.16]  And every time we read the Noah story, we don't know what to do with the story.
[4433.16 --> 4441.16]  Because when we look at the world around us and our scientific worldview, we see the story about angels having children with humans.
[4441.16 --> 4444.16]  And it just, it doesn't match what we see in the world.
[4444.16 --> 4449.16]  Everything we know about history and science is telling us something that this simply isn't true.
[4449.16 --> 4454.16]  So, let's read Genesis 6, the biblical account of the same story in Enoch.
[4454.16 --> 4456.16]  Genesis 6, 1-5 says,
[4456.16 --> 4462.16]  When human beings began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them,
[4462.16 --> 4467.16]  the sons of God saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful, and they married any of them that they chose.
[4467.16 --> 4469.16]  Then the Lord said,
[4469.16 --> 4498.16]  Now, this is similar to what happens in the book of Enoch.
[4498.16 --> 4501.16]  But we need to look at three things first.
[4501.16 --> 4508.16]  The first is that the word for human in the phrase daughters of humans is the word men in Old English.
[4508.16 --> 4515.16]  And in Hebrew, the word man or men can be used to describe all humans or just men.
[4515.16 --> 4521.16]  The second thing is that the word Nephilim translates as fallen ones or giants.
[4521.16 --> 4526.16]  And when used, the word giant can also describe somebody who is great.
[4526.16 --> 4529.16]  He's a giant of a man or a giant in his industry.
[4529.16 --> 4541.16]  The Nephilim in the passage are described as heroes of old, men of great renown, highlighting the emphasis on men of renown, not giants or human monster angel thing.
[4541.16 --> 4550.16]  The third thing is that the term sons of God was used as a term to mean king by all the nations in the Middle East at the time.
[4550.16 --> 4553.16]  Most notably, King David was referred to as a son of God.
[4553.16 --> 4568.16]  So with all three things in mind, all together, we find that the story in Genesis might just be talking about evil kings of the earth having children that become historically renowned heroes who are sinful and evil.
[4568.16 --> 4572.16]  People who have no regard for God and what he wants.
[4572.16 --> 4574.16]  People who rule and live by their desires.
[4574.16 --> 4581.16]  They don't seek to live in community, but rather to use violence and to abuse the power and responsibility invested in them.
[4581.16 --> 4585.16]  To live by what is right in their own eyes and not what is good in God's eyes.
[4585.16 --> 4591.16]  And when people live in that way, what's right in their own eyes, we see the kinds of behaviors they live out.
[4591.16 --> 4593.16]  They falter people for personal gain.
[4593.16 --> 4595.16]  They degrade the people around them.
[4595.16 --> 4600.16]  They make them feel small so that they can point out the flaws in others to make themselves feel great.
[4600.16 --> 4617.16]  Jude quotes the book of Enoch about this apocryphal prophecy handed to Enoch about a future day of judgment in which all the sin and the defilement that these corrupt angels brought would be judged and their descendants would be destroyed.
[4617.16 --> 4620.16]  Jude verse 14 to 16 says this.
[4620.16 --> 4624.16]  Enoch, the seventh from Adam prophesied about them.
[4624.16 --> 4633.16]  See, the Lord is coming with thousands upon thousands of His holy ones to judge everyone and to convict all of them of the ungodly acts they have committed in their ungodliness.
[4633.16 --> 4641.16]  And of all the defiant words ungodly sinners have spoken against Him, these people are grumblers and fault finders.
[4641.16 --> 4646.26]  faultfinders. They follow their own evil desires. They boast about themselves and flatter others
[4646.26 --> 4654.16]  for their own advantage. Now to wrap everything we've covered, put it all together. In Genesis
[4654.16 --> 4660.86]  5 to 6, Enoch is a person who lived during the time of the Nephilim. In the apocryphal book,
[4661.32 --> 4666.46]  First Enoch, Enoch is a bringer of a prophecy about a future judgment where God will judge
[4666.46 --> 4673.94]  those Nephilim and fallen angels for their ungodliness. Jude takes that prophecy that isn't
[4673.94 --> 4681.38]  real about the Nephilim and links it to the ungodly people in his time and in ours and tells us that
[4681.38 --> 4688.46]  that judgment that the one this fake Enoch is telling us about is about Christ at the end of
[4688.46 --> 4696.44]  times, the judgment we're waiting for. He was talking about the corruption and the evil people
[4696.44 --> 4702.70]  who were amongst him and us. These people do not have the Holy Spirit, people who are in the church
[4702.70 --> 4708.92]  community but not justified by Christ, people who are living a superficial Christian life and talking
[4708.92 --> 4716.18]  about Jesus, but they do not live a repentant life. They are goats in sheep's clothing. They are
[4716.18 --> 4722.48]  ungodly, as Enoch says and Jude quotes. Jude goes on to write more about this in a few verses later.
[4722.48 --> 4727.02]  He gives a contrast between the ungodly and the godly. This is what he says,
[4727.94 --> 4733.44]  But you, dear friends, you, by building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy
[4733.44 --> 4738.32]  Spirit, keep yourselves in God's love as you wait for the mercy of the Lord Jesus Christ
[4738.32 --> 4745.40]  to bring you to eternal life. Jude is telling us that what separates us and the ungodly
[4745.40 --> 4754.50]  is Christ. And we pray in the Holy Spirit. We are justified in being sanctified. We still sin.
[4755.30 --> 4760.92]  We still find faults in others. We still grumble. We still sin with all the fashions and the varieties
[4760.92 --> 4768.62]  of the time. But when we sin, we go to Christ. We pray and we speak to him and know that he, what he desires.
[4768.62 --> 4775.62]  And when we do these things, we repent. And when we love him who first loved us, we stay in that love
[4775.62 --> 4783.16]  because that's where his mercy is found. But all of this hinges on one thing. Faith.
[4785.70 --> 4792.38]  Jude charges the church and us in the face of corruption and sin to seek and dive into faith.
[4793.10 --> 4798.60]  Seek God with all your heart. Pray and talk with him. The ungodly do not have God and do not know
[4798.60 --> 4805.60]  God. But we have had the undeserving and merciful chance to know him and worship him and love him
[4805.60 --> 4812.66]  and be loved by him. But all of this is because of faith. Faith is how we come to know and trust in
[4812.66 --> 4818.84]  him. And just like the author of Hebrews said about Enoch, faith is the only way to please God.
[4820.74 --> 4827.54]  Jude and the author of Hebrews are both drawing upon Enoch and his story to present to the church this
[4827.54 --> 4834.54]  aspect of reality. Faith is the only way to please God. And that faith leads to eternal life.
[4835.54 --> 4840.64]  Now, faith here doesn't mean just mentally acknowledging God exists, though that is part
[4840.64 --> 4846.74]  of it as said in Hebrews. The faith that pleases God is a faith of repentance, a faith that leads to
[4846.74 --> 4852.68]  obedience. A faith spoken of here is a faith where the fruit of good actions and love for others and God
[4852.68 --> 4858.64]  are visible. A faith that pleases God is a faith that changes how we behave and look at the world.
[4859.42 --> 4865.04]  A faith that leads to eternal life is a faith that works. A faith that causes us to act out of faith
[4865.04 --> 4874.46]  that shows us it's what shows to be true faith. But that faith is a gift given to us out of grace.
[4874.46 --> 4881.44]  Ephesians 2, 8-9 says, for by grace you have been saved through faith. For this is not your doing,
[4881.68 --> 4887.16]  it is a gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.
[4888.92 --> 4895.80]  Everything from predestination to final glorification is God's job. That's what he did to bring us to the
[4895.80 --> 4902.28]  point of being able to believe. That's what he means by, in Ephesians, that it's not your own doing,
[4902.28 --> 4910.10]  that it's a gift. The Holy Spirit regenerated our dead hearts and minds by grace alone, allowing us
[4910.10 --> 4915.58]  to be able to believe, allowing us to have faith in the Christ that has saved us.
[4917.42 --> 4924.08]  The very same faith is what allows for justification and sanctification and glorification to come about.
[4924.44 --> 4929.76]  It's through faith that the aspects of Christ, his righteousness, and his image can take hold on us.
[4929.76 --> 4936.56]  But this faith is not something achieved or did. There is no boasting in our faith, as Ephesians says.
[4937.36 --> 4943.92]  The faith is a gift, and we use it. By believing, as I said, in Christ's image starts to take hold of you.
[4944.40 --> 4947.22]  And if your faith is real, that image starts to act out in us.
[4948.36 --> 4950.92]  And we start to image Christ in our lives and in our actions.
[4951.48 --> 4953.96]  We start to do the things that Christ did in his life.
[4953.96 --> 4961.36]  And these other people, the Hebrews 11 passages, all these heroes of faith, we start to act like them.
[4962.12 --> 4965.40]  We start to do works out of faith in Christ.
[4965.94 --> 4969.12]  These works don't save us or even make us a better person.
[4970.20 --> 4972.28]  Because again, it was a gift.
[4974.42 --> 4975.52]  But what about Enoch?
[4975.52 --> 4979.90]  Enoch, he was born 4,000 years before Jesus.
[4981.16 --> 4982.82]  He was even born before Abraham.
[4983.68 --> 4985.76]  Enoch is seventh from Adam.
[4986.20 --> 4988.72]  There were only six generations of people before him.
[4990.88 --> 4993.34]  Could Enoch have walked faithfully with Jesus?
[4993.68 --> 4996.84]  Known him to walk with God faithfully?
[4996.96 --> 4997.78]  How could he have done that?
[4997.78 --> 5006.02]  Well, Enoch, being so close to the fall of mankind, would have known from his family what God had said to Adam and Eve.
[5007.14 --> 5016.54]  Actually, funny enough, if you do the math, Adam, in Genesis 5, if you go to the genealogy in Genesis 5, Genesis 6, from Adam to Noah,
[5017.28 --> 5021.80]  you'll read that Adam would have been 622 years old when Enoch was born.
[5022.60 --> 5025.12]  And Adam died at the age of 930.
[5025.12 --> 5032.00]  Enoch could have had direct access to the source from the one who brought sin into the world.
[5032.96 --> 5037.34]  Enoch would have known about the fall and the curses placed on the serpent and Adam and Eve.
[5038.26 --> 5043.22]  From one of the people who was there, Enoch would have known what God said to the serpent,
[5043.60 --> 5047.36]  the one who introduced all this mess to humanity on that fateful day.
[5048.08 --> 5052.72]  Enoch would have known this curse God spoke to the serpent in Genesis 3.15.
[5052.72 --> 5059.48]  And I will put enmity between you and the woman, between your offspring and hers.
[5060.00 --> 5063.54]  He will crush your head and you will strike his heel.
[5065.30 --> 5073.14]  Enoch knew that one day a human appointed by God would kill the serpent that ruined everything.
[5073.14 --> 5082.20]  He had faith in God's promise that a human man would kill the serpent and as a result be killed by the serpent.
[5083.40 --> 5090.68]  You see, the way the phrase is written, it tells us that this is a singular act, not two different events in succession.
[5091.56 --> 5096.92]  The curse is written in such a way that the defeat of the man and the defeat of the serpent are simultaneous.
[5096.92 --> 5101.18]  That the thing that kills the man would be the death of the serpent.
[5102.38 --> 5103.64]  This is the cross.
[5104.20 --> 5105.80]  This is the gospel promise.
[5106.72 --> 5112.54]  The cross is the same thing at the same time that killed Jesus was the thing that killed the serpent.
[5113.38 --> 5118.78]  That day, 2,000 years ago, the promised son of Eve crushed the head of the serpent.
[5118.78 --> 5121.26]  And the serpent bit his heel.
[5121.92 --> 5128.58]  That day, 2,000 years ago, the event that Enoch had faith would happen actually happened.
[5129.20 --> 5137.84]  And because of his faith in the promised curse on the serpent, he had faith in a man who would please God by defeating the enemy.
[5138.76 --> 5140.98]  Enoch had faith in Christ.
[5141.72 --> 5144.42]  The only one who could please God through obedience.
[5144.42 --> 5151.28]  And because of that faith, that Enoch, he was able to walk in faith with God.
[5151.72 --> 5153.98]  And in doing so, obey and please him.
[5154.58 --> 5159.88]  And his reward for having faithfully walked with God was that he didn't die.
[5161.12 --> 5162.64]  Instead, he got taken by God.
[5163.08 --> 5165.92]  He got taken because in Jude 20, 21, we read,
[5166.36 --> 5171.18]  Waiting in God's love so that the mercy of Christ may lead us to eternal life.
[5171.18 --> 5180.04]  When we jump back to Genesis 5, the passage about Enoch, we're reading a genealogy from Adam to Noah.
[5181.00 --> 5185.80]  Genealogies in the Bible, however, are not just to tell us family lineages or how old someone is.
[5186.40 --> 5190.30]  The genealogies are teaching us as much as the stories they are paired with.
[5191.18 --> 5196.72]  The genealogy in the beginning of Luke is telling us that Jesus is the Son of God.
[5196.72 --> 5203.20]  The genealogy in Matthew is telling you that Jesus is of the tribe of Judah and the Son of David.
[5204.08 --> 5209.04]  The genealogy after Noah's Ark is telling us about all the children of each family
[5209.04 --> 5211.86]  because God's command was to be fruitful and multiply.
[5213.46 --> 5216.06]  In Genesis 5, we are following the fall of man,
[5217.00 --> 5220.60]  where God promised that everyone would die because they ate the fruit.
[5220.60 --> 5225.64]  But not Enoch.
[5226.72 --> 5229.46]  And in the genealogy, he is in the very middle.
[5230.08 --> 5231.88]  There's six people above him and six people below.
[5233.64 --> 5237.52]  And in Hebrew, there's a literary structure called a chiasm.
[5237.96 --> 5241.56]  And whatever's in the very middle of the story is the point.
[5243.24 --> 5247.44]  The genealogy isn't telling us that Enoch fathered Methuselah.
[5247.44 --> 5255.12]  The point of the genealogy is that when you are in a world where everyone dies due to the sins we commit,
[5256.10 --> 5259.66]  walking faithfully with God leads to eternal life.
[5260.64 --> 5264.96]  The point of the genealogy is that walking faithfully with God leads to eternal life.
[5264.96 --> 5271.72]  Now, at the end of each of these sermons,
[5272.28 --> 5277.80]  we highlight a person in our life that have been in emblems of the kind of faith we see.
[5279.24 --> 5281.42]  And so, Grandma, I apologize,
[5282.26 --> 5285.40]  but you're the person in my life that has been an emblem of this kind of faith.
[5286.90 --> 5289.24]  For those who don't know, Trudy Bauman is my grandmother.
[5289.52 --> 5290.32]  She sits in the back.
[5290.32 --> 5292.48]  Your faithfulness is astounding.
[5293.56 --> 5295.36]  Your pattern of prayer and devotion,
[5295.68 --> 5298.22]  your dedication to family and friends is like nothing I've seen.
[5298.80 --> 5300.12]  In the face of great loss,
[5300.18 --> 5302.52]  you have been steadfast because of your faith in Jesus Christ.
[5303.24 --> 5305.24]  And you've lived by Jesus' words,
[5305.38 --> 5308.28]  do not let your right hand know what your left hand is doing.
[5308.72 --> 5312.58]  And so, well, I will not get into any specific stories to respect that.
[5312.58 --> 5319.30]  But I don't need to because most, if not all, people here have been blessed by you doing works
[5319.30 --> 5322.44]  of obedience to Christ out of your faith in Him.
[5324.10 --> 5326.64]  And for those who don't know, she works behind the scenes.
[5326.80 --> 5329.30]  And so, you don't get to see how she blesses us.
[5329.66 --> 5330.94]  But her faithfulness is there.
[5331.42 --> 5333.88]  Just like Enoch's, you don't see it, but it's there.
[5335.20 --> 5338.36]  And when I see both these people, Enoch and my grandma,
[5338.66 --> 5340.16]  I think of Micah 6.8.
[5340.16 --> 5342.26]  What does the Lord require of you?
[5342.90 --> 5347.04]  To act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God.
[5348.14 --> 5354.40]  A faith that pleases God acts justly, loves mercy, and walks humbly with God.
[5355.16 --> 5356.00]  Enoch did that.
[5356.40 --> 5357.24]  We don't know how.
[5357.92 --> 5358.98]  We just know that he did.
[5359.80 --> 5360.74]  Grandma does that.
[5361.00 --> 5361.94]  We don't know how.
[5362.54 --> 5363.42]  She just does.
[5364.40 --> 5368.80]  You have modeled this same kind of faith for me, our family, and the church.
[5370.16 --> 5375.76]  And so, with that church, let's walk faithfully with our God and pray to Him.
[5380.44 --> 5382.66]  Dear Lord, thank you for this day.
[5383.46 --> 5385.98]  Thank you, Lord, for another chance to walk with you.
[5386.56 --> 5390.48]  And thank you for your faithfulness, the faithfulness that matters.
[5390.48 --> 5393.68]  Thank you for your gift of faith to us, Lord.
[5395.46 --> 5397.84]  I pray that we would be faithful as much as we can.
[5398.92 --> 5400.68]  We could use that gift well.
[5401.96 --> 5402.34]  Amen.
[5402.34 --> 5402.42]  Amen.
[5402.42 --> 5415.76]  Please stand as we sing Cornerstone.
[5415.76 --> 5439.80]  My hope is filled on happiness.
[5439.80 --> 5469.78]  My hope is filled on nothing else.
[5469.80 --> 5474.80]  In Jesus' love and righteousness.
[5474.80 --> 5481.66]  I dare not trust the sweetest frame.
[5481.66 --> 5487.44]  But wholly trust in Jesus' name.
[5487.44 --> 5489.44]  Christ the Lord, Lord of all.
[5489.44 --> 5495.44]  Christ the Lord, cornerstone.
[5495.44 --> 5502.38]  Weak made strong in the Savior's love.
[5502.38 --> 5511.44]  Through the storm, He is Lord, Lord of all.
[5511.44 --> 5523.08]  When darkness seems to hide His face.
[5523.08 --> 5529.18]  I rest on His unchanging grace.
[5529.18 --> 5531.18]  In every high and storm, He is Lord, Lord of all.
[5531.18 --> 5534.18]  In every high and storm, He cares.
[5534.18 --> 5536.18]  My anger holds within the veil.
[5536.18 --> 5540.18]  My anger holds within the veil.
[5540.18 --> 5542.18]  My anger holds within the veil.
[5542.18 --> 5546.18]  My anger holds within the veil.
[5546.18 --> 5547.18]  Christ the Lord, cornerstone.
[5547.18 --> 5561.18]  Weak made strong in the Savior's love.
[5561.18 --> 5576.18]  Through the storm, He is Lord, Lord of all.
[5576.18 --> 5577.18]  Christ the Lord, Lord of all.
[5577.18 --> 5581.18]  When He shall come with trumpet sound.
[5581.18 --> 5588.18]  Oh, may I then in Him be found.
[5588.18 --> 5594.18]  Dressed in His righteousness alone.
[5594.18 --> 5601.18]  Father, stand before the storm.
[5601.18 --> 5608.18]  Rise alone, Lord of all.
[5608.18 --> 5615.18]  Weak made strong in Savior's love.
[5615.18 --> 5623.18]  Through the storm, He is Lord, Lord of all.
[5623.18 --> 5624.18]  Lord of all.
[5624.18 --> 5625.18]  Rise alone, cornerstone.
[5625.18 --> 5628.18]  Weak made strong in the Savior's love.
[5628.18 --> 5633.18]  Rise alone, cornerstone.
[5633.18 --> 5638.18]  Weak made strong in the Savior's love.
[5638.18 --> 5652.18]  Through the storm, He is Lord, Lord of all.
[5652.18 --> 5665.18]  The Lord's blessing.
[5665.18 --> 5667.18]  The Lord bless you and keep you.
[5667.18 --> 5670.18]  The Lord make His face shine on you and be gracious to you.
[5670.18 --> 5673.18]  The Lord turn His face towards you and give you peace.
[5673.18 --> 5675.18]  Amen.
[5675.18 --> 5701.12]  There's a place where the streets shine with the glory of a man.
[5701.12 --> 5709.38]  There's a way we can go there, we can bear, bear, be our time.
[5709.38 --> 5724.38]  Because of you, because of you, because of your love, because of your love.
[5724.38 --> 5733.38]  No more pain, no more sadness, no more suffering, no less.
[5734.12 --> 5741.38]  No more sin, no more sickness, no injustice, no more death.
[5741.38 --> 5756.38]  Because of you, because of you, because of your love.
[5756.38 --> 5765.44]  Oh, the sins are washed away, and we can live forever.
[5766.54 --> 5770.84]  Now we have His own, because of you.
[5770.84 --> 5780.84]  Oh, we'll see Him face today, and we will dance together.
[5781.84 --> 5786.84]  In the city of our God, because of you.
[5786.84 --> 5796.84]  Oh, we'll see Him face today, and we will dance together.
[5796.84 --> 5801.84]  There's a place where the streets are, and we will dance together.
[5801.84 --> 5805.84]  There's a place where the streets are, and we will dance together.
[5805.84 --> 5821.84]  There's a place where the streets are, and we will dance together.
[5821.84 --> 5840.84]  There's a place where the streets are, and we will dance together.
[5840.84 --> 5843.56]  Oh, we'll see you next time.
[5843.56 --> 5844.56]  We'll see you next time.
[5844.56 --> 5853.40]  We will dance together in the city of honor because of you.
[5855.24 --> 5859.56]  Oh, my sweet soul wash away.
[5860.84 --> 5863.50]  We can live forever.
[5864.90 --> 5868.92]  I'll be with you, son, because of you.
[5870.84 --> 5874.28]  Oh, we'll see you next time.
[5874.28 --> 5875.28]  We'll see you next time.
[5875.28 --> 5884.40]  We will dance together in the city of honor because of you.
[5900.84 --> 5904.28]  We'll see you next time.
[5904.28 --> 5907.72]  We'll see you next time.
[5907.72 --> 5911.16]  We'll see you next time.
[5911.16 --> 5914.60]  We'll see you next time.
[5914.60 --> 5918.04]  We'll see you next time.
[5918.04 --> 5921.48]  We'll see you next time.
[5921.48 --> 5924.92]  We'll see you next time.
[5924.92 --> 5928.36]  We'll see you next time.
[5928.36 --> 5930.36]  We'll see you next time.
[5930.36 --> 5931.36]  We'll see you next time.
[5931.36 --> 5934.80]  We'll see you next time.
[5934.80 --> 5936.80]  We'll see you next time.
[5936.80 --> 5937.68]  We'll see you next time.
[5938.12 --> 5945.26]  We'll see you next time.
[5945.28 --> 5946.00]  Bye.
[5946.00 --> 5946.76]  Bye.
[5946.76 --> 5947.34]  Bye.
[5951.32 --> 5952.00]  Bye.
[5952.00 --> 5953.62]  Bye.
[5954.12 --> 5955.92]  Bye.
[5955.92 --> 5957.92]  Amen.
[5985.92 --> 5987.92]  Thank you.
[5987.92 --> 5989.92]  Thank you.
[5989.92 --> 5993.92]  Thank you for always so fearlessly leaving us.
[5993.92 --> 5995.92]  Oh, no. I apologize.
[5995.92 --> 5997.92]  I feel like I apologize.
[5997.92 --> 5999.92]  Anyway, tell us this one.
[5999.92 --> 6001.92]  Thank you.
[6001.92 --> 6003.92]  I'm glad you're still on my team.
[6003.92 --> 6005.92]  They're playing for...
[6005.92 --> 6007.92]  They're playing for...
[6007.92 --> 6009.92]  They're playing for...
[6009.92 --> 6011.92]  They're playing for...
[6011.92 --> 6013.92]  They're all kidding.
