[0.00 → 15.76] Testing, testing.
[15.76 → 17.56] Good.
[17.56 → 18.70] Okay.
[18.70 → 19.82] Thanks.
[30.00 → 32.00] Thanks.
[32.00 → 33.00] Thanks.
[33.00 → 35.00] The kind that won't go away.
[35.00 → 40.00] When I turned around, they were right there to remind me.
[40.00 → 42.00] I've seen regret.
[42.00 → 46.00] The kind that messes with your hair.
[46.00 → 49.00] The failures and the can't forgets.
[49.00 → 53.00] But standing here now, I'm thinking, God, it's behind me.
[53.00 → 59.00] Because I've seen nails, scarred hands reach out and wipe it all away.
[59.00 → 60.00] Yeah.
[60.00 → 62.00] Now I see grace.
[62.00 → 63.00] Hallelujah.
[63.00 → 65.00] I stand amazed.
[65.00 → 68.00] I'm staring at an empty grave.
[68.00 → 72.00] And the stone that you rolled away.
[72.00 → 73.00] Yeah.
[73.00 → 76.00] When I was a prodigal, you saw, son.
[76.00 → 80.00] When I left the night and night, you saw the one.
[80.00 → 85.00] And just like that, all my past has been erased.
[85.00 → 88.00] When I look back, I see grace.
[88.00 → 92.00] I still hurt.
[92.00 → 95.00] Fall short on what you say I'm worth.
[95.00 → 100.00] And that devil says I don't deserve what you did on the cross.
[100.00 → 101.00] And he's right.
[101.00 → 102.00] Because I don't.
[102.00 → 104.00] But you did it anyway.
[104.00 → 105.00] I see grace.
[105.00 → 106.00] Hallelujah.
[106.00 → 107.00] I stand.
[107.00 → 108.00] I've seen shame.
[108.00 → 109.00] The kind that comes from mistakes.
[109.00 → 110.00] The kind that won't go away.
[110.00 → 112.00] When I turned around, they were right there to remind me.
[112.00 → 114.00] I've seen regret.
[114.00 → 116.00] The kind that messes with your hair.
[116.00 → 117.00] The failures and the can't forgets.
[117.00 → 120.00] But standing here now, I'm thinking God is behind me.
[120.00 → 122.00] Because I've seen nails scarred hands reach out and wipe it all away.
[122.00 → 123.00] Yeah.
[123.00 → 124.00] Now I see grace.
[124.00 → 125.00] Hallelujah.
[125.00 → 126.00] I stand amazed.
[126.00 → 129.00] I'm staring at an empty grave.
[129.00 → 130.00] And the stone that you rolled away.
[130.00 → 131.00] Yeah.
[131.00 → 132.00] When I was with my grace.
[132.00 → 133.00] I was with my grace.
[133.00 → 134.00] I was with your hair.
[134.00 → 135.00] And the failures and the can't forgets.
[135.00 → 136.00] But standing here now, I'm thinking God is behind me.
[136.00 → 141.00] Because I've seen nails scarred hands reach out and wipe it all away.
[141.00 → 142.00] Owen.
[142.00 → 143.00] Maya.
[143.00 → 144.00] Bye-bye.
[144.00 → 145.00] Fox Odessa.
[146.00 → 147.00] Herrera.
[147.00 → 148.00] Good morning, Maize.
[148.00 → 149.00] Good morning, maize.
[149.00 → 150.00] R l favour.
[150.00 → 151.00] The.
[151.00 → 152.00] Book on maize.
[152.00 → 155.00] And the gift or the has their own perlite.
[155.00 → 156.00] Voting these Mini.
[156.96 → 158.00] Help get done, their Father.
[158.00 → 161.00] Get down here, She runs on tang, Peel the high blood.
[161.00 → 162.00] Work.
[162.00 → 163.00] Bam.
[163.00 → 163.96] Hold their COSI
[163.96 → 165.96] Be careful when I turn away.
[166.00 → 169.00] Not only for the wild Suellen or the right, I period.
[169.00 → 170.00] It has riverines gotten earned.
[170.00 → 173.38] When I look back, I see grace.
[174.70 → 179.90] I still hurt, fall short on what you say I'm worth.
[180.42 → 184.64] And that devil says I don't deserve what you did on the cross.
[184.74 → 186.18] And he's right, because I don't.
[186.34 → 188.26] But you did it anyway.
[188.44 → 189.84] I see grace.
[190.52 → 193.16] Hallelujah, I stand amazed.
[193.64 → 196.38] I'm staring at an empty grave.
[196.38 → 199.80] And the stone that you rolled away.
[200.96 → 204.52] When I was prodigal, you saw the sun.
[204.78 → 207.86] When I left the 99, you saw the one.
[208.12 → 212.80] And just like that, all my past has been reversed.
[213.06 → 218.72] When I look back, I see grace, grace.
[220.24 → 222.12] God's grace.
[222.40 → 225.24] Grace that is greater than all my sin.
[225.24 → 228.48] Faith, God Almighty, going to see it again.
[228.48 → 232.06] Oh, praise, praise.
[233.00 → 235.34] God's grace.
[235.34 → 242.00] Grace that is greater than all my sin.
[242.00 → 244.52] I see grace.
[244.52 → 247.96] Hallelujah, I stand amazed.
[247.96 → 250.92] I'm staring at an empty grave.
[250.92 → 254.60] And the stone that you rolled away.
[254.60 → 255.52] Yeah, yeah.
[255.52 → 257.80] I was a prodigal.
[257.80 → 259.18] You saw the sun.
[259.18 → 262.46] When I left the 99, you saw the one.
[262.46 → 267.42] And just like that, all my past has been erased.
[267.42 → 271.38] When I look back, I see grace.
[271.38 → 271.84] I see grace.
[271.84 → 276.10] I see grace.
[276.10 → 279.74] I see grace.
[279.74 → 281.74] I see grace.
[281.74 → 283.74] I see grace.
[283.74 → 285.98] Grace.
[285.98 → 287.34] Oh, grace.
[287.34 → 290.00] Oh, grace.
[290.00 → 297.74] Grace that is greater than all my sin.
[297.74 → 312.00] Don't toil.
[312.12 → 312.74] Oh.
[312.74 → 315.02], and you?
[315.02 → 317.32] Oh, grace.
[317.32 → 347.30] Thank you.
[347.32 → 354.32] He's coming on the clouds, kings and kingdoms will bow down.
[357.56 → 364.82] And every chain will break, his broken hearts declare his praise.
[365.16 → 368.76] But who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[370.36 → 375.30] Our God is the lion, the lion of Judah.
[375.30 → 381.00] He's roaring with power and fighting our battles.
[381.58 → 385.78] And every knee will bow before you.
[386.72 → 391.30] Our God is the lamb, the lamb that was slain.
[392.14 → 397.26] For the sin of the world, his blood breaks the chains.
[397.26 → 402.70] And every knee will bow before the lion and the lamb.
[403.04 → 408.68] Oh, every knee will bow before the lion and the lamb.
[408.68 → 415.18] Oh, every knee will bow before the lion and the lamb.
[416.96 → 418.20] Oh, every knee will bow before the lion and the lamb.
[418.20 → 425.38] So open up the gates, make way before the king of kings.
[425.38 → 431.16] Our God is the lion and the lamb.
[431.16 → 433.66] Our God is the lion and the lamb.
[433.66 → 435.66] Our God is the lion and the lamb.
[435.66 → 436.66] The lamb and the lamb.
[436.66 → 437.54] He's the lion and the lamb.
[437.54 → 439.04] For the sin of the king.
[439.04 → 439.44] Our God is the lion and the lamb.
[439.44 → 439.64] For the sin of the Lord, his blood breaks the chains.
[439.64 → 440.64] And every knee will bow before the lion and the lamb.
[440.64 → 441.66] And every knee will bow before the lion and the lamb.
[441.66 → 446.18] God is the Lion, the Lion of Judah.
[446.18 → 451.86] He's roaring with power and fighting our battles.
[452.46 → 456.66] And every knee will bow before Him.
[457.66 → 465.38] Our God is the Lamb, the Lamb that was slain for the sin of the world.
[465.38 → 468.20] His blood breaks the chains.
[468.20 → 473.62] In every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb.
[473.86 → 480.58] Oh, every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb.
[489.92 → 494.24] Who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[495.38 → 499.72] Who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[500.76 → 505.14] Who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[506.28 → 510.58] Who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[511.94 → 516.06] Oh, who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[517.20 → 521.52] Who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[521.52 → 527.00] Oh, who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[528.56 → 531.34] Who can stop the Lord?
[533.90 → 539.02] Our God is the lion, the lion of Judah
[539.02 → 544.72] He's roaring with power and fighting the battles
[544.72 → 549.46] Every knee will bow before you
[549.46 → 555.52] Our God is the lamb, the lamb that was slain
[555.52 → 560.94] For the sin of the world, His blood breaks the chains
[560.94 → 566.38] Every knee will bow before the lion and the lamb
[566.38 → 573.48] Every knee will bow before the lion and the lamb
[573.48 → 583.48] Oh, and every knee will bow before the lion and the lamb
[583.48 → 593.48] Oh, every knee will bow before the lion and the lamb
[593.48 → 618.18] I've been walking through this life
[618.18 → 623.64] Feeling empty on the inside
[623.64 → 628.08] Just when I thought my hope had died
[628.08 → 634.18] You were there to bring me back to life
[634.80 → 637.92] You, you wake my love
[637.92 → 640.34] You renew my strength
[640.34 → 642.56] You restore my heart
[642.56 → 647.72] Good morning
[647.72 → 654.48] Welcome to worship on this March break Sunday
[654.48 → 657.88] For those of you who are a week into March break
[657.88 → 658.96] I hope that's going well
[658.96 → 661.32] For those of you who are just starting March break
[661.32 → 665.00] Congratulations on the beginning of this two-week break
[665.00 → 668.18] We're excited to gather for worship this morning
[668.18 → 669.80] If you're visiting with us
[669.80 → 672.04] We are particularly excited that you're here
[672.04 → 673.48] We'd love to connect with you
[673.48 → 676.86] In your seats are these connect cards
[676.86 → 679.34] I encourage you to fill one of those out
[679.34 → 682.82] Or you can scan the QR code and fill it out that way
[682.82 → 684.90] And we'll reach out and touch base with you
[684.90 → 687.40] I should also say my name is Chris
[687.40 → 689.18] I'm one of the pastors here
[689.18 → 694.52] And it's my privilege to lead in our worship together this morning
[694.52 → 698.50] Before we begin, just a couple of announcements
[698.50 → 703.36] First, I wanted to just say that the Mexico team that we have sent down
[703.36 → 704.60] They have arrived safely
[704.60 → 708.46] And are worshipping today in a couple places
[708.46 → 710.72] In Rosarito and in Tijuana
[710.72 → 714.48] I texted Brandon last night at around 7
[714.48 → 717.38] And I said, I assume everyone made it in safely
[717.38 → 719.40] And he's like, well, we're not back at the base yet
[719.40 → 721.26] Because everybody wanted tacos first
[721.26 → 724.72] So they spent the evening getting tacos
[724.72 → 725.82] And getting situated
[725.82 → 728.80] But they did make it back to the base
[728.80 → 730.08] And are settled in for today
[730.08 → 735.08] As well, this evening is a young adult potluck
[735.08 → 737.68] And so if you are interested in that
[737.68 → 739.66] There are details on Instagram
[739.66 → 741.34] And Josh might be somewhere
[741.34 → 743.22] He can give you those details too
[743.22 → 745.86] That's this evening here at church
[745.86 → 747.48] Here at church
[747.48 → 752.24] And you can come and share a meal together for that
[752.24 → 754.94] Otherwise, I think that's it for our announcements
[754.94 → 757.50] So I'm going to invite you to stand where you are
[757.50 → 760.32] As we come into the presence of God together
[760.32 → 769.16] God gathers us up in worship
[769.16 → 773.38] And he meets us here in special and unique ways
[773.38 → 776.90] And we mark that by receiving his greeting
[776.90 → 779.60] Receive the greeting of our good God
[779.60 → 784.26] Grace, mercy, and peace to you
[784.26 → 785.82] From God our Father
[785.82 → 788.80] From the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son, and our Saviour
[788.80 → 792.04] Through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit
[792.04 → 793.76] Amen
[793.76 → 798.54] I'm going to invite you to turn to those with whom you are worshipping
[798.54 → 800.20] Welcoming them in the name of Jesus
[800.20 → 801.98] Passing the peace of Christ
[801.98 → 822.46] I know
[822.46 → 834.52] Good morning
[834.52 → 838.18] As our call to worship this morning
[838.18 → 840.58] We'd like to just take a moment
[840.58 → 842.56] To give a little introduction to
[842.56 → 843.98] Our first song
[843.98 → 845.86] Behold Our God
[845.86 → 847.84] It's not new
[847.84 → 849.36] And we have sung it before
[849.36 → 850.94] But it's such a powerful song
[850.94 → 853.72] It's a song of adoration
[853.72 → 855.18] For the risen King
[855.18 → 857.46] Which draws from Isaiah 40
[857.46 → 860.28] It's a passage in which the prophet Isaiah
[860.28 → 862.52] Gives comfort to God's people
[862.52 → 866.08] By focusing on the overwhelming power
[866.08 → 868.10] And the glory of God
[868.10 → 870.84] Here's what Isaiah says in chapter 40
[870.84 → 875.02] Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand
[875.02 → 878.22] Or with the breadth of his hand marked off the heavens
[878.22 → 882.62] Who has held the dust of the earth in a basket
[882.62 → 884.68] Or weighed the mountains on the scales
[884.68 → 886.28] And the hills in a balance
[886.28 → 889.92] As I was preparing the worship this past week
[889.92 → 892.84] This song Behold Our God
[892.84 → 894.18] Came to my mind
[894.18 → 896.10] I was struck this week
[896.10 → 898.18] By all that's going on
[898.18 → 900.34] In our world these days
[900.34 → 903.40] And also in our own congregation here
[903.40 → 906.50] Wars and hunger globally for sure
[906.50 → 908.76] But here in our own lives
[908.76 → 912.76] Within our Emmanuel Church community
[912.76 → 916.86] We have, or we may be feeling overwhelmed
[916.86 → 919.22] Or stressed or grieving
[919.22 → 922.08] We are experiencing high inflation
[922.08 → 926.76] Some of us are having to deal with expensive mortgages or rents
[927.76 → 929.42] Some are dealing with addictions
[929.42 → 932.80] Or illness and even death in the family
[932.80 → 935.60] Sometimes we need to be reminded
[935.60 → 938.26] Just of how powerful and almighty
[938.26 → 940.30] And in control of things God is
[940.30 → 942.62] But as much as we need to hear
[942.62 → 945.68] How great and mighty our God is
[945.68 → 947.44] We might even need something more
[947.44 → 949.30] And I needed something more
[949.30 → 950.70] And there it is
[950.70 → 952.54] It's in verse 11 of the same chapter
[952.54 → 954.80] It says he tends his flocks
[954.80 → 955.96] That's us
[955.96 → 957.26] That's you and that's me
[957.26 → 958.58] Like a shepherd
[958.58 → 961.40] He gathers the lambs in his arms
[961.40 → 964.10] And he carries them close to his heart
[964.10 → 966.34] I needed to hear that
[966.34 → 969.64] I needed to hear just how much
[969.64 → 972.34] The great creator of everything good
[972.34 → 974.96] Our almighty and all powerful God
[974.96 → 976.36] Loves us
[976.36 → 979.22] And how deeply he cares for each one of us
[979.22 → 981.80] Like a shepherd who cares so deeply
[981.80 → 983.18] For each of his lambs
[983.18 → 985.98] That he suffered and gave up his own life
[985.98 → 986.70] To save them
[986.70 → 988.16] To save us
[988.16 → 990.72] May we find incredible comfort in
[990.72 → 992.00] And peace in that
[992.00 → 994.20] Let's adorn him together this morning
[994.20 → 994.82] As we sing
[994.82 → 996.14] Behold our God
[996.14 → 1025.12] Who has held the oceans in his hands
[1025.12 → 1030.60] Who has numbered every grain of sand
[1030.60 → 1033.12] Kings and nations
[1033.12 → 1036.38] Tremble at his voice
[1036.38 → 1042.12] All creation rises to rejoice
[1042.12 → 1047.12] Behold our God
[1047.74 → 1050.12] Seated on his throne
[1050.12 → 1054.12] Come let us adore him
[1054.12 → 1058.12] Behold our King
[1058.12 → 1061.12] Nothing can compare
[1061.12 → 1064.12] Come let us adore him
[1064.12 → 1070.12] Who has given counsel to the Lord
[1070.12 → 1078.12] Who can question any of his words
[1078.12 → 1082.12] Who can teach the one who knows
[1082.12 → 1085.12] Who can question any of his words
[1085.12 → 1086.12] Who can teach the one who knows
[1086.12 → 1089.12] Who can question any of his words
[1089.12 → 1091.12] Who can teach the one who knows
[1091.12 → 1093.12] Who can teach the one who knows
[1093.12 → 1095.12] Who can teach the one who knows all things
[1095.12 → 1096.12] Who can fathom all his wondrous deeds
[1096.12 → 1100.12] Who can fathom all his wondrous deeds
[1100.12 → 1107.12] Behold our God
[1107.12 → 1108.12] Behold our God
[1108.12 → 1110.12] Seated on his throne

[2128.30 → 2158.28] Thank you.
[2158.30 → 2162.92] Good morning.
[2163.86 → 2165.08] My name is Clem.
[2165.16 → 2166.54] I'm one of the deacons here at Emanuel.
[2167.88 → 2172.18] The first offering this morning is for the ministry and missions of Emanuel,
[2172.84 → 2178.16] and the second one is refugee sponsorship fund for the special offering.
[2179.32 → 2182.72] The special offering next week is for Life Water Canada,
[2182.72 → 2190.04] and for every dollar spent is fresh water for a child for a year.
[2190.74 → 2197.18] So now I'd like to invite Peter to come up and say something about the refugee fund.
[2198.66 → 2200.42] Yes, thank you, Clem.
[2200.42 → 2206.74] I'd like to draw the congregation's attention this morning to the refugee sponsorship fund.
[2207.54 → 2212.38] I was really touched this morning with when Harvey spoke about Behold Your God,
[2212.74 → 2217.58] and as he referenced our call to worship, he mentioned how, you know,
[2217.62 → 2220.80] there are a lot of problems and a lot of issues in the world,
[2220.80 → 2228.04] in the world and also in our local community and indeed in our church family here.
[2229.14 → 2234.24] And we just sang, the Lord is gracious and compassionate.
[2234.24 → 2239.84] And I was thinking, man, he is gracious and compassionate,
[2240.16 → 2246.08] and he allows us to walk with him as we develop more fully into who our God is,
[2246.20 → 2251.48] how mighty he is, and what a wonderful Saviour Jesus Christ is for us, our risen Lord,
[2251.94 → 2254.68] that we can participate in showing that compassion.
[2255.30 → 2258.64] And at this church, we have a refugee sponsorship committee,
[2259.28 → 2260.74] and I'm chair of that committee,
[2260.74 → 2263.94] and we have about eight members in our congregation that are involved,
[2264.10 → 2266.70] including Clem, who represents the deacons.
[2267.60 → 2271.12] So we have, we work with World Renew,
[2271.44 → 2275.08] and we're currently sponsoring a family who's located in Lebanon,
[2275.80 → 2278.76] a mom and a dad and two children.
[2279.66 → 2283.24] And the application process has been filed.
[2283.74 → 2286.90] It's been accepted and gone through World Renew.
[2287.36 → 2289.54] Now the government has to look at it.
[2289.54 → 2293.32] And once we have, the government has approved it,
[2293.40 → 2296.40] we will obviously introduce that to the congregation.
[2297.46 → 2300.74] At this point, this morning, we're asking you to give an offering.
[2301.44 → 2302.72] Now the family's not here.
[2303.10 → 2307.90] If you've been reading, you know it's become a long and arduous journey
[2307.90 → 2311.02] for people who are refugees to come into this country.
[2311.46 → 2312.74] It could be up to two years.
[2312.86 → 2314.70] But we need to fill our bank account.
[2314.70 → 2317.26] We currently have about $12,000 there,
[2317.42 → 2320.06] and we'd like to keep building it up because it'll cost,
[2320.18 → 2321.76] by one time the family is here,
[2322.36 → 2327.04] the cost will be around about $40,000 to sponsor a family for a year.
[2327.70 → 2329.56] May God bless you as you give.
[2329.94 → 2331.04] Have a wonderful Sunday.
[2331.04 → 2361.02] May God bless you as you give.
[2361.02 → 2391.00] May God bless you as you give.
[2391.02 → 2398.64] May God bless you as you come into this
[2398.64 → 2399.76] Step is...
[2399.76 → 2400.68] May God bless you as you give.
[2400.92 → 2402.84] May God bless you as you give.
[2402.96 → 2404.90] May God bless you as you give.
[2405.06 → 2407.38] May God bless you as you give.
[2407.54 → 2409.96] May God bless you as you give.
[2409.96 → 2411.80] May God bless you as you give,
[2411.80 → 2412.30] May God bless you as you give as you give.
[2412.30 → 2413.24] May God bless you as you give.
[2413.24 → 2414.52] May God bless you as you give.
[2414.52 → 2417.02] May God bless you as you give,
[2417.02 → 2417.82] May God bless you as you give.
[2417.88 → 2418.48] May God bless you as you give.
[2418.48 → 2418.84] May God bless you as you give.
[2418.84 → 2418.96] May God bless you as you give.
[2418.96 → 2428.40] So put your hope in God alone
[2428.40 → 2433.26] Take courage in his power to save
[2433.26 → 2438.14] Completely and forever won
[2438.14 → 2444.04] By Christ emerging from the grave
[2444.04 → 2446.54] I will wait for you
[2446.54 → 2449.00] I will wait for you
[2449.00 → 2452.78] On your word I will rely
[2452.78 → 2456.46] I will wait for you
[2456.46 → 2458.94] Surely wait for you
[2458.94 → 2463.34] Till my soul is satisfied
[2463.34 → 2474.94] His steadfast love has made a way
[2474.94 → 2480.90] And God himself has paid the price
[2480.90 → 2485.02] That all who trust in him today
[2485.02 → 2489.40] Find healing in his sacrifice
[2489.40 → 2492.86] I will wait for you
[2492.86 → 2495.36] I will wait for you
[2495.36 → 2499.48] Through the storm and through the night
[2499.48 → 2502.86] I will wait for you
[2502.86 → 2505.36] Surely wait for you
[2505.36 → 2509.36] For your love is my delight
[2509.36 → 2511.32] I will wait for you

[2515.32 → 2515.82] I will wait for you
[2515.82 → 2519.44] In your word I will rely
[2519.44 → 2522.82] I will wait for you

[2533.28 → 2535.28] I will wait for you
[2535.28 → 2547.20] All right
[2547.20 → 2549.32] Can we have the kids
[2549.32 → 2553.22] Age three to grade four
[2553.22 → 2555.90] Come on up
[2555.90 → 2558.16] This is for children's worship time
[2558.16 → 2558.88] And so parents
[2558.88 → 2560.96] If you are visiting with us
[2560.96 → 2562.20] And you have kids in that group
[2562.20 → 2563.70] They can come up to the front
[2563.70 → 2565.28] Or you can leave with them
[2565.28 → 2566.58] Follow the crowd
[2566.58 → 2568.12] And get them checked in
[2568.12 → 2569.42] Down there
[2569.42 → 2572.26] All right
[2572.26 → 2575.66] How many of you guys
[2575.66 → 2577.20] Are on March break right now?
[2580.74 → 2582.06] Almost all of you?
[2582.36 → 2583.46] It's called spring break
[2583.46 → 2584.52] Spring break, sorry
[2584.52 → 2586.64] Sorry, is March break
[2586.64 → 2587.40] An Ontario thing?
[2588.20 → 2589.98] Ah, okay
[2589.98 → 2591.60] My apologies Haley
[2591.60 → 2592.88] Thank you for correcting me
[2592.88 → 2594.56] Can always count on you
[2594.56 → 2597.60] Your grandma and grandpa
[2597.60 → 2598.74] From Ontario are visiting
[2598.74 → 2600.16] See, they call it March break too
[2600.16 → 2601.50] So I was right
[2601.50 → 2607.36] Ladies and gentlemen
[2607.36 → 2608.48] Haley has a loose tooth
[2608.48 → 2610.84] All right
[2610.84 → 2612.20] That's amazing
[2612.20 → 2612.62] You know what?
[2612.66 → 2613.76] I'm excited for you guys
[2613.76 → 2614.80] To get to go to
[2614.80 → 2615.96] Children's worship time
[2615.96 → 2618.20] Mrs. Amy and Mr. Dave
[2618.20 → 2618.92] Have something planned
[2618.92 → 2619.58] For you over there
[2619.58 → 2620.14] Do you have something?
[2620.14 → 2620.40] No
[2620.40 → 2624.70] You're also on March break?
[2625.36 → 2626.08] Very good
[2626.08 → 2628.06] Before you guys go

[2632.58 → 2633.94] The way we do the blessing here
[2633.94 → 2634.78] The kids will stand
[2634.78 → 2635.42] They will say
[2635.42 → 2636.80] The Lord be with you
[2636.80 → 2638.14] And then everyone will respond
[2638.14 → 2638.70] And say
[2638.70 → 2640.36] And also with you
[2640.36 → 2641.24] And, so I'm going to invite

[2645.58 → 2646.68] We will say the blessing
[2646.68 → 2647.18] Okay
[2647.18 → 2649.76] Let's pray together
[2649.76 → 2651.24] Lord Jesus
[2651.24 → 2652.66] We pray that you would
[2652.66 → 2654.40] Go with these children
[2654.40 → 2655.94] So they can learn
[2655.94 → 2656.78] About you

[2660.26 → 2661.62] Your love
[2661.62 → 2662.76] Let them know
[2662.76 → 2664.30] Your gospel

[2672.98 → 2674.48] And then together
[2674.48 → 2676.96] The Lord be with you
[2676.96 → 2679.16] And also with you
[2679.16 → 2679.74] Amen
[2679.74 → 2680.08] Amen

[2713.36 → 2713.92] Amen
[2713.92 → 2713.94] Hello
[2713.94 → 2714.90] I'm Eric here
[2714.90 → 2715.80] An elder at the church
[2715.80 → 2716.64] And I'd like to lead you
[2716.64 → 2717.86] In our family church prayer
[2717.86 → 2721.00] Praise be to God
[2721.00 → 2722.02] And Father
[2722.02 → 2723.46] Our Lord Jesus Christ
[2723.46 → 2724.18] The Father
[2724.18 → 2725.62] Of compassion
[2725.62 → 2726.66] And the God
[2726.66 → 2727.44] Of all comfort
[2727.44 → 2728.74] Who comforts us
[2728.74 → 2730.16] In all our troubles
[2730.16 → 2731.62] So that we can comfort
[2731.62 → 2732.86] Those in any trouble
[2732.86 → 2734.32] With the comfort
[2734.32 → 2735.78] We ourselves receive
[2735.78 → 2736.38] From God
[2736.38 → 2738.14] We pray for
[2738.14 → 2739.48] Comfort and peace
[2739.48 → 2740.26] For the Skipper
[2740.26 → 2741.44] And Vanderhoek families
[2741.44 → 2742.92] As Fran's dad
[2742.92 → 2743.84] John Vanderhoek
[2743.84 → 2745.30] Passed away earlier this month
[2745.30 → 2746.48] Now the families
[2746.48 → 2747.40] Will have the opportunity
[2747.40 → 2749.06] To gather later this week
[2749.06 → 2750.66] For the celebration of life
[2750.66 → 2752.28] Be with the families
[2752.28 → 2753.06] And their travelling
[2753.06 → 2755.08] To and from this celebration
[2755.08 → 2757.14] We also think of
[2757.14 → 2758.44] Our Mexico team this week
[2758.44 → 2758.82] As they
[2758.82 → 2760.96] Thank you for keeping them safe
[2760.96 → 2761.66] In their travels
[2761.66 → 2764.20] Down to Mexico yesterday
[2764.20 → 2766.78] Now that they are
[2766.78 → 2767.72] Please continue
[2767.72 → 2768.82] To calm their hearts
[2768.82 → 2771.40] May the people praise you
[2771.40 → 2771.78] God
[2771.78 → 2772.86] May all the people
[2772.86 → 2773.48] Praise you
[2773.48 → 2775.04] Bless the youth
[2775.04 → 2775.62] And the leaders
[2775.62 → 2776.70] In the work you have
[2776.70 → 2777.56] Prepared for them
[2777.56 → 2778.22] This week
[2778.22 → 2780.64] And the travelling home
[2780.64 → 2781.72] Later this week as well
[2781.72 → 2784.80] We also want to keep others
[2784.80 → 2786.76] Who are on their spring break
[2786.76 → 2787.30] At this time
[2787.30 → 2788.34] Travelling or resting
[2788.34 → 2789.44] Or enjoying some time
[2789.44 → 2790.52] Downtime with family
[2790.52 → 2791.06] And friends
[2791.06 → 2791.38] Lord
[2791.38 → 2794.06] We also think of our
[2794.06 → 2795.84] Aging loved ones
[2795.84 → 2796.10] Lord
[2796.10 → 2797.70] Please keep them safe
[2797.70 → 2798.36] And comfortable
[2798.36 → 2801.70] Lord we also want to pray
[2801.70 → 2802.72] Today for
[2802.72 → 2803.78] SAI Kisser
[2803.78 → 2804.76] As he continues
[2804.76 → 2805.46] His treatment
[2805.46 → 2806.34] For lung cancer
[2806.34 → 2807.68] Keep him comfortable
[2807.68 → 2809.44] And bring him healing
[2809.44 → 2810.12] To his body
[2810.12 → 2813.34] May the Lord bless us
[2813.34 → 2814.68] And may the Holy Spirit
[2814.68 → 2815.70] Be presented with
[2815.70 → 2816.86] Present with us
[2816.86 → 2818.68] As we worship together today
[2818.68 → 2819.36] Amen
[2837.68 → 2846.20] Spend some time together
[2846.20 → 2848.10] Reading and reflecting
[2848.10 → 2850.84] On the next section
[2850.84 → 2853.44] In our Romans series
[2853.44 → 2856.00] We've been in the book of Romans
[2856.00 → 2859.46] Looking at how Paul presents
[2859.46 → 2860.72] To us the gospel
[2860.72 → 2862.04] From first to last
[2862.04 → 2863.74] From beginning to end
[2863.74 → 2865.78] And we have been digging deep
[2865.78 → 2866.86] And studying there
[2866.86 → 2869.32] Today we're going to read
[2869.32 → 2871.00] Romans 5
[2871.00 → 2872.00] Verse 12
[2872.00 → 2873.58] Through 21
[2873.58 → 2875.18] As always
[2875.18 → 2876.20] It will be on the screen
[2876.20 → 2876.88] Behind me
[2876.88 → 2878.18] But I do encourage you
[2878.18 → 2878.72] To have a Bible
[2878.72 → 2879.64] In your hands
[2879.64 → 2880.32] Or on your phone
[2880.32 → 2881.44] Or device
[2881.44 → 2883.44] And keep that in front of you
[2883.44 → 2884.28] As we will be
[2884.28 → 2886.06] Very intentionally
[2886.06 → 2887.02] Referring back
[2887.02 → 2888.14] As we go
[2888.14 → 2890.20] Let me read
[2890.20 → 2891.20] Our text
[2891.20 → 2892.18] For this morning
[2892.18 → 2893.66] Romans 5
[2893.66 → 2894.00] Beginning
[2894.00 → 2895.36] At verse 12
[2895.36 → 2899.78] Therefore
[2899.78 → 2901.52] Just as sin
[2901.52 → 2902.48] Entered the world
[2902.48 → 2903.80] Through one man
[2903.80 → 2904.76] And death
[2904.76 → 2905.80] Through sin
[2905.80 → 2907.28] And in this way
[2907.28 → 2908.98] Death came to all people
[2908.98 → 2910.36] Because all sinned
[2910.36 → 2912.10] To be sure
[2912.10 → 2913.42] Sin was in the world
[2913.42 → 2914.90] Before the law was given
[2914.90 → 2916.86] But sin is not charged
[2916.86 → 2918.16] Against anyone's account
[2918.16 → 2919.40] Where there is no law
[2919.40 → 2920.50] Nevertheless
[2920.50 → 2921.78] Death reigned
[2921.78 → 2923.02] From the time of Adam
[2923.02 → 2924.14] To the time of Moses
[2924.14 → 2925.16] Even over those
[2925.16 → 2926.04] Who did not sin
[2926.04 → 2927.32] By breaking a command
[2927.32 → 2928.24] As Adam did
[2928.24 → 2929.76] Who is a pattern
[2929.76 → 2930.78] Of the one to come
[2930.78 → 2932.64] But the gift
[2932.64 → 2933.48] Is not like
[2933.48 → 2934.26] The trespass
[2934.26 → 2936.12] For if the many died
[2936.12 → 2937.02] By the trespass
[2937.02 → 2937.78] Of the one man
[2937.78 → 2938.90] How much more
[2938.90 → 2939.94] Did God's grace
[2939.94 → 2940.58] And the gift
[2940.58 → 2941.96] That came by the grace
[2941.96 → 2943.04] Of the one man
[2943.04 → 2943.88] Jesus Christ
[2943.88 → 2945.48] Overflow to the many
[2945.48 → 2948.36] Nor can the gift
[2948.36 → 2949.08] Of God
[2949.08 → 2949.76] Be compared
[2949.76 → 2950.58] With the result
[2950.58 → 2951.72] Of one man's sin
[2951.72 → 2953.16] The judgment
[2953.16 → 2954.34] Followed one sin
[2954.34 → 2955.52] And brought condemnation
[2955.52 → 2956.12] But the gift
[2956.12 → 2957.50] Followed many trespasses
[2957.50 → 2958.88] And brought justification
[2958.88 → 2960.74] For if
[2960.74 → 2961.84] By the trespass
[2961.84 → 2962.62] Of one man
[2962.62 → 2963.40] Death reigned
[2963.40 → 2964.92] Through that one man
[2964.92 → 2965.96] How much more
[2965.96 → 2967.28] Will those who receive
[2967.28 → 2968.22] God's abundant
[2968.22 → 2969.28] Provision of grace
[2969.28 → 2970.52] And the gift
[2970.52 → 2971.30] Of righteousness
[2971.30 → 2972.64] Reign in life
[2972.64 → 2974.42] Through the one man
[2974.42 → 2975.50] Jesus Christ
[2975.50 → 2977.72] Consequently
[2977.72 → 2979.60] Just as one
[2979.60 → 2980.28] Trespass
[2980.28 → 2980.96] Resulted in
[2980.96 → 2981.72] Condemnation
[2981.72 → 2982.64] For all people
[2982.64 → 2983.46] So also
[2983.46 → 2985.06] One righteous act
[2985.06 → 2985.78] Resulted in
[2985.78 → 2986.56] Justification
[2986.56 → 2987.20] And life
[2987.20 → 2988.28] For all people
[2988.28 → 2990.12] For just as
[2990.12 → 2991.34] Through the disobedience
[2991.34 → 2992.14] Of the one man
[2992.14 → 2993.08] The many were made
[2993.08 → 2993.50] Sinners
[2993.50 → 2994.58] So also
[2994.58 → 2996.00] Through the obedience
[2996.00 → 2997.32] Of the one man
[2997.32 → 2998.70] The many will be made
[2998.70 → 2999.70] Righteous
[2999.70 → 3002.78] The law was brought in
[3002.78 → 3004.28] So that the trespass
[3004.28 → 3005.28] Might increase
[3005.28 → 3006.62] But where sin
[3006.62 → 3007.36] Increased
[3007.36 → 3009.06] Grace increased
[3009.06 → 3009.92] All the more
[3009.92 → 3011.52] So that
[3011.52 → 3012.50] Just as sin
[3012.50 → 3013.52] Reigned in death
[3013.52 → 3014.52] So also
[3014.52 → 3015.68] Grace might reign
[3015.68 → 3016.84] Through righteousness
[3016.84 → 3018.24] To bring eternal life
[3018.24 → 3020.02] Through Jesus Christ
[3020.02 → 3021.20] Our Lord
[3021.20 → 3022.80] This is the word
[3022.80 → 3023.18] Of the Lord
[3023.18 → 3031.78] Some of you may
[3031.78 → 3033.02] Be aware
[3033.02 → 3035.32] But the Trinity
[3035.32 → 3036.58] Western University
[3036.58 → 3038.08] Volleyball teams
[3038.08 → 3039.00] Are competing
[3039.00 → 3040.68] In the national
[3040.68 → 3041.96] Championship tournament
[3041.96 → 3043.28] The men are in
[3043.28 → 3043.58] Hamilton
[3043.58 → 3044.26] And the women
[3044.26 → 3045.52] Are at UBC
[3045.52 → 3047.18] Yesterday
[3047.18 → 3048.62] Malachi
[3048.62 → 3049.60] My son
[3049.60 → 3051.14] Who's eight years old
[3051.14 → 3051.68] And I
[3051.68 → 3053.28] Watched the men
[3053.28 → 3055.44] Beat McMaster University
[3055.44 → 3056.80] In order to advance
[3056.80 → 3057.80] To the gold medal game
[3057.80 → 3060.08] It was an awesome
[3060.08 → 3060.80] Match
[3060.80 → 3063.26] And relatively
[3063.26 → 3064.16] Back and forth
[3064.16 → 3064.94] But in the end
[3064.94 → 3066.04] Trinity just
[3066.04 → 3067.68] Outclassed McMaster
[3067.68 → 3069.48] At one point
[3069.48 → 3070.02] In the game
[3070.02 → 3071.76] Malachi
[3071.76 → 3072.58] Who's only just
[3072.58 → 3073.20] Learning what
[3073.20 → 3074.12] Volleyball is like
[3074.12 → 3075.00] And thinks the sport
[3075.00 → 3075.50] Is amazing
[3075.50 → 3076.28] And fast-paced
[3076.28 → 3077.30] As people are
[3077.30 → 3078.32] Smashing balls
[3078.32 → 3080.50] At 98.5 miles per hour
[3080.50 → 3082.00] Malachi turns to me
[3082.00 → 3082.50] And he goes
[3082.50 → 3083.24] Dad
[3083.24 → 3084.26] We're winning
[3084.26 → 3085.88] And I said
[3085.88 → 3086.94] Yeah we are
[3086.94 → 3089.78] And we do that
[3089.78 → 3090.42] In sports
[3090.42 → 3091.28] Right
[3091.28 → 3092.24] Notice Malachi
[3092.24 → 3093.08] Has never played
[3093.08 → 3094.26] Volleyball in his life
[3094.26 → 3095.06] He's never been to
[3095.06 → 3096.74] Trinity Western University
[3096.74 → 3097.76] He's definitely not
[3097.76 → 3098.80] On their volleyball team
[3098.80 → 3099.52] Maybe one day
[3099.52 → 3100.08] Who knows
[3100.08 → 3101.56] But he said
[3101.56 → 3102.04] We
[3102.04 → 3103.04] Are winning
[3103.04 → 3105.18] We do this
[3105.18 → 3105.94] All over the place
[3105.94 → 3106.58] In sports
[3106.58 → 3107.62] I'm going to trigger
[3107.62 → 3108.24] A few of you
[3108.24 → 3108.78] Right now
[3108.78 → 3110.42] Did anybody watch
[3110.42 → 3111.24] The Leafs win
[3111.24 → 3113.38] Because we won
[3113.38 → 3116.74] You know who
[3116.74 → 3117.36] We won against
[3117.36 → 3118.06] Ottawa and
[3118.06 → 3118.30] Eric
[3118.30 → 3118.62] Who else
[3118.62 → 3119.24] Did we just beat
[3119.24 → 3120.94] The Canes
[3120.94 → 3122.60] Hmm
[3122.60 → 3125.28] I'll do this one
[3125.28 → 3125.74] For Kevin
[3125.74 → 3126.80] Did anybody see
[3126.80 → 3128.02] Edmonton win
[3128.02 → 3129.16] Recently
[3129.16 → 3129.94] Right
[3129.94 → 3131.34] We won there too
[3131.34 → 3132.80] You know what
[3132.80 → 3133.64] I'll even give you this
[3133.64 → 3135.02] Did anyone see
[3135.02 → 3135.84] The Canucks win
[3135.84 → 3137.66] Because we won
[3137.66 → 3138.30] There too
[3138.30 → 3140.16] Now that one's
[3140.16 → 3140.84] More surprising
[3140.84 → 3141.60] We know that
[3141.60 → 3143.80] Point is
[3143.80 → 3144.06] Right
[3144.06 → 3144.78] When it comes to
[3144.78 → 3145.46] Sports
[3145.46 → 3146.52] We
[3146.52 → 3148.08] Are part of
[3148.08 → 3148.62] The team
[3148.62 → 3149.98] There's a
[3149.98 → 3150.54] Union
[3150.54 → 3152.24] That exists
[3152.24 → 3153.76] In our own
[3153.76 → 3154.28] Minds
[3154.28 → 3154.60] In our own
[3154.60 → 3155.18] Imaginations
[3155.18 → 3155.72] In our own
[3155.72 → 3156.64] Relationship
[3156.64 → 3157.68] To it
[3157.68 → 3159.32] There's this
[3159.32 → 3160.28] Strange
[3160.28 → 3160.94] Almost
[3160.94 → 3162.10] Mystical
[3162.10 → 3163.68] Connection
[3163.68 → 3165.16] That makes you
[3165.16 → 3166.18] Part of
[3166.18 → 3166.96] Something
[3166.96 → 3168.88] That you
[3168.88 → 3169.16] Maybe
[3169.16 → 3169.74] Have no
[3169.74 → 3170.72] Reason
[3170.72 → 3171.18] Or
[3171.18 → 3171.78] Means
[3171.78 → 3172.34] Otherwise
[3172.34 → 3173.28] To be
[3173.28 → 3173.66] Part of
[3173.66 → 3176.88] What Paul
[3176.88 → 3177.48] Does
[3177.48 → 3178.34] In this
[3178.34 → 3179.04] Part of
[3179.04 → 3179.50] Romans
[3179.50 → 3180.96] Is help
[3180.96 → 3181.76] Us see
[3181.76 → 3182.22] How
[3182.22 → 3183.42] That kind
[3183.42 → 3183.86] Of
[3183.86 → 3185.16] Spiritual
[3185.16 → 3186.40] Union
[3186.40 → 3187.14] That kind
[3187.14 → 3187.64] Of
[3187.64 → 3188.98] Mystical
[3188.98 → 3189.52] Union
[3189.52 → 3190.54] Also
[3190.54 → 3191.94] Applies
[3191.94 → 3192.88] In
[3192.88 → 3193.78] Relationship
[3193.78 → 3194.60] First
[3194.60 → 3194.78] To
[3194.78 → 3195.10] Adam
[3195.10 → 3196.48] And
[3196.48 → 3196.82] Than
[3196.82 → 3197.10] By
[3197.10 → 3197.50] Grace
[3197.50 → 3197.92] Through
[3197.92 → 3198.28] Faith
[3198.28 → 3198.94] To
[3198.94 → 3199.32] Christ
[3199.32 → 3201.32] In
[3201.32 → 3201.56] Fact
[3201.56 → 3201.94] Verse
[3201.94 → 3202.42] Twelve
[3202.42 → 3203.40] Introduces
[3203.40 → 3204.40] For us
[3204.40 → 3205.24] A theological
[3205.24 → 3205.94] Idea
[3205.94 → 3206.86] That is
[3206.86 → 3208.18] I'm not
[3208.18 → 3208.82] Overstating
[3208.82 → 3209.34] The case
[3209.34 → 3210.30] Foundational
[3210.30 → 3211.20] To all
[3211.20 → 3211.92] Christian
[3211.92 → 3213.10] Theology
[3213.10 → 3215.20] Because of
[3215.20 → 3215.64] The truth
[3215.64 → 3216.02] That Paul
[3216.02 → 3216.46] Is building
[3216.46 → 3216.90] On here
[3216.90 → 3217.74] We need
[3217.74 → 3218.24] A saviour
[3218.24 → 3219.80] Because of
[3219.80 → 3220.16] The truth
[3220.16 → 3220.54] That Paul
[3220.54 → 3220.98] Is building
[3220.98 → 3221.50] On here
[3221.50 → 3222.28] We have
[3222.28 → 3222.66] One
[3222.66 → 3224.44] And without
[3224.44 → 3225.92] This truth
[3225.92 → 3226.58] Pulling it
[3226.58 → 3227.22] All together
[3227.22 → 3228.40] None of
[3228.40 → 3228.72] The book
[3228.72 → 3229.28] Of Romans
[3229.28 → 3229.64] Makes
[3229.64 → 3230.34] Any sense
[3230.34 → 3233.12] So I'd like
[3233.12 → 3233.52] To look at
[3233.52 → 3233.96] That a little
[3233.96 → 3234.26] Bit more
[3234.26 → 3234.72] Closely
[3234.72 → 3235.32] And hopefully
[3235.32 → 3235.88] You'll see
[3235.88 → 3236.10] It
[3236.10 → 3237.22] With me
[3237.22 → 3238.48] So with
[3238.48 → 3239.02] Your Bibles
[3239.02 → 3239.52] Open
[3239.52 → 3239.94] In verse
[3239.94 → 3240.36] Twelve
[3240.36 → 3241.64] Paul begins
[3241.64 → 3243.26] Therefore
[3243.26 → 3244.46] Just as
[3244.46 → 3244.84] Sin
[3244.84 → 3245.42] Entered
[3245.42 → 3245.92] The world
[3245.92 → 3246.42] Through
[3246.42 → 3246.96] One
[3246.96 → 3247.80] Man
[3247.80 → 3249.52] Sin
[3249.52 → 3250.18] Entered
[3250.18 → 3250.60] The world
[3250.60 → 3250.98] Through
[3250.98 → 3251.60] One
[3251.60 → 3252.08] Man
[3252.08 → 3252.52] Now first
[3252.52 → 3252.88] Of all
[3252.88 → 3253.48] Let's not
[3253.48 → 3253.76] Get ahead
[3253.76 → 3254.08] Of ourselves
[3254.08 → 3254.38] We have
[3254.38 → 3254.68] To know
[3254.68 → 3255.38] What sin
[3255.38 → 3256.18] Is
[3256.18 → 3258.00] Now back
[3258.00 → 3258.80] In Romans
[3258.80 → 3259.46] 1 and you
[3259.46 → 3259.98] Can see it
[3259.98 → 3260.26] If you
[3260.26 → 3260.90] Flip back
[3260.90 → 3261.50] Particularly
[3261.50 → 3262.04] Verses
[3262.04 → 3262.62] 18 to
[3262.62 → 3263.10] 32
[3263.10 → 3264.42] We can
[3264.42 → 3264.98] See that
[3264.98 → 3265.92] Sin is
[3265.92 → 3266.74] At root
[3266.74 → 3268.42] An exchanging
[3268.42 → 3269.16] Of the truth
[3269.16 → 3269.92] Of God
[3269.92 → 3271.20] For a lie
[3271.20 → 3272.82] It is a
[3272.82 → 3273.42] Suppressing
[3273.42 → 3274.26] Of the truth
[3274.26 → 3275.04] Of God
[3275.04 → 3276.22] To serve
[3276.22 → 3276.76] Or to
[3276.76 → 3277.50] Hold up
[3277.50 → 3278.26] Created
[3278.26 → 3279.06] Things
[3279.06 → 3280.12] At root
[3280.12 → 3281.26] Fundamentally
[3281.26 → 3282.40] All sin
[3282.40 → 3282.98] Is
[3282.98 → 3284.22] Idolatry
[3284.22 → 3285.12] Stemming
[3285.12 → 3285.66] From the
[3285.66 → 3286.26] Idea
[3286.26 → 3287.62] That you
[3287.62 → 3288.56] Have a
[3288.56 → 3289.68] Better idea
[3289.68 → 3290.80] About what
[3290.80 → 3291.76] Is good
[3291.76 → 3292.86] Than God
[3292.86 → 3293.22] Does
[3293.22 → 3294.52] That you
[3294.52 → 3294.92] Have a
[3294.92 → 3295.60] Better idea
[3295.60 → 3296.12] About what
[3296.12 → 3296.70] Will fill you
[3296.70 → 3297.26] With purpose
[3297.26 → 3297.76] Or meaning
[3297.76 → 3298.46] Or joy
[3298.46 → 3299.44] Than God
[3299.44 → 3299.80] Does
[3299.80 → 3301.06] And it's
[3301.06 → 3301.60] Out of
[3301.60 → 3301.94] This
[3301.94 → 3303.42] Depraved
[3303.42 → 3304.02] Mind
[3304.02 → 3304.42] That's
[3304.42 → 3304.86] Paul's
[3304.86 → 3305.24] Phrase
[3305.24 → 3305.82] In chapter
[3305.82 → 3306.08] 1
[3306.08 → 3306.22] Verse
[3306.22 → 3306.64] 28
[3306.64 → 3307.58] It's
[3307.58 → 3307.96] Out of
[3307.96 → 3308.18] This
[3308.18 → 3308.84] Depraved
[3308.84 → 3309.40] Mind
[3309.40 → 3309.68] That
[3309.68 → 3310.52] The
[3310.52 → 3311.40] Specific
[3311.40 → 3312.42] Lists
[3312.42 → 3312.98] That we
[3312.98 → 3313.36] Can read
[3313.36 → 3313.72] Through the
[3313.72 → 3314.12] Bible
[3314.12 → 3314.96] Specific
[3314.96 → 3315.56] Acts
[3315.56 → 3316.90] Of sinning
[3316.90 → 3317.84] Comes
[3317.84 → 3319.56] And this
[3319.56 → 3320.20] Compounds
[3320.20 → 3320.50] And we
[3320.50 → 3320.86] See it
[3320.86 → 3321.46] Compounding
[3321.46 → 3322.86] In our
[3322.86 → 3323.20] Hearts
[3323.20 → 3323.54] And in
[3323.54 → 3323.68] Our
[3323.68 → 3324.02] Lives
[3324.02 → 3324.28] And it
[3324.28 → 3324.86] Builds
[3324.86 → 3325.54] In Romans
[3325.54 → 3326.44] Chapter 3
[3326.44 → 3327.68] Where we
[3327.68 → 3329.20] See that
[3329.20 → 3329.56] The sort
[3329.56 → 3330.36] Of culmination
[3330.36 → 3330.72] Of the
[3330.72 → 3331.02] Case
[3331.02 → 3331.48] Against
[3331.48 → 3331.92] Us
[3331.92 → 3333.00] Chapter 3
[3333.00 → 3333.36] Says
[3333.36 → 3334.00] There is
[3334.00 → 3335.04] No one
[3335.04 → 3336.04] Righteous
[3336.04 → 3337.72] Not even
[3337.72 → 3338.08] One
[3338.08 → 3339.56] There is
[3339.56 → 3340.06] No one
[3340.06 → 3340.62] Who seeks
[3340.62 → 3341.10] God
[3341.10 → 3341.88] That all
[3341.88 → 3342.32] Have turned
[3342.32 → 3342.74] Away
[3342.74 → 3343.28] There's
[3343.28 → 3343.82] No one
[3343.82 → 3344.28] Who does
[3344.28 → 3344.66] Good
[3344.66 → 3345.16] Not
[3345.16 → 3345.86] Even
[3345.86 → 3346.72] One
[3346.72 → 3348.54] That's
[3348.54 → 3349.00] The first
[3349.00 → 3349.48] Truth
[3349.48 → 3350.02] Of sin
[3350.02 → 3350.36] That is
[3350.36 → 3351.46] Foundational
[3351.46 → 3352.04] To our
[3352.04 → 3352.82] Understanding
[3352.82 → 3353.10] Here
[3353.10 → 3354.04] And then
[3354.04 → 3354.74] Paul adds
[3354.74 → 3355.06] And we're
[3355.06 → 3355.42] Back in
[3355.42 → 3355.90] Verse 12
[3355.90 → 3356.24] Of our
[3356.24 → 3356.56] Text
[3356.56 → 3357.70] Sin entered
[3357.70 → 3358.20] The world
[3358.20 → 3358.74] Through
[3358.74 → 3359.64] One
[3359.64 → 3360.68] Man
[3360.68 → 3362.56] Now keep
[3362.56 → 3362.90] Reading
[3362.90 → 3363.40] And you
[3363.40 → 3363.98] Find out
[3363.98 → 3364.32] That
[3364.32 → 3365.12] One man
[3365.12 → 3366.06] That first
[3366.06 → 3366.64] Head
[3366.64 → 3368.12] Is Adam
[3368.12 → 3369.46] Right
[3369.46 → 3369.96] Adam
[3369.96 → 3370.58] In the
[3370.58 → 3370.96] Garden
[3370.96 → 3372.52] The first
[3372.52 → 3373.98] Man
[3373.98 → 3374.76] Created
[3374.76 → 3375.22] And then
[3375.22 → 3375.60] Eve
[3375.60 → 3376.30] Along with
[3376.30 → 3376.62] Him
[3376.62 → 3377.06] Adam
[3377.06 → 3377.56] In the
[3377.56 → 3377.94] Garden
[3377.94 → 3379.22] Represents
[3379.22 → 3380.18] All of
[3380.18 → 3381.00] Humanity
[3381.00 → 3382.78] Right
[3382.78 → 3383.04] And in
[3383.04 → 3383.48] The good
[3383.48 → 3383.98] So when
[3383.98 → 3384.56] God told
[3384.56 → 3384.94] Adam
[3384.94 → 3385.70] To fill
[3385.70 → 3386.24] The earth
[3386.24 → 3387.10] Right
[3387.10 → 3387.50] When God
[3387.50 → 3388.00] Told Adam
[3388.00 → 3388.66] To rule
[3388.66 → 3389.22] Over the
[3389.22 → 3389.44] Earth
[3389.44 → 3389.70] When he
[3389.70 → 3390.06] Told him
[3390.06 → 3391.36] To curate
[3391.36 → 3391.98] And to
[3391.98 → 3392.58] Create
[3392.58 → 3392.94] When he
[3392.94 → 3393.30] Told him
[3393.30 → 3393.80] To make
[3393.80 → 3394.20] Art
[3394.20 → 3394.74] And to
[3394.74 → 3395.38] Learn
[3395.38 → 3395.72] When he
[3395.72 → 3396.30] Told Adam
[3396.30 → 3397.28] To explore
[3397.28 → 3397.90] And to
[3397.90 → 3398.78] Study
[3398.78 → 3399.90] He told
[3399.90 → 3400.58] The rest
[3400.58 → 3401.42] Of humanity
[3401.42 → 3402.40] Through him
[3402.40 → 3404.48] Right
[3404.48 → 3404.98] When Adam
[3404.98 → 3405.44] Is given
[3405.44 → 3406.60] That mandate
[3406.60 → 3407.10] We
[3407.10 → 3408.22] As the rest
[3408.22 → 3408.76] Of humanity
[3408.76 → 3409.52] Are given
[3409.52 → 3410.18] That mandate
[3410.18 → 3411.32] But likewise
[3411.32 → 3412.60] When Adam
[3412.60 → 3413.60] Rebelled
[3413.60 → 3415.12] When Adam
[3415.12 → 3415.96] Was cursed
[3415.96 → 3417.32] That curse
[3417.32 → 3417.96] Is also
[3417.96 → 3418.92] Ours
[3418.92 → 3420.34] Right
[3420.34 → 3420.72] All of
[3420.72 → 3421.22] Humanity
[3421.22 → 3422.34] According to
[3422.34 → 3422.80] Paul here
[3422.80 → 3423.28] In Romans
[3423.28 → 3423.80] Is not
[3423.80 → 3424.96] Just like
[3424.96 → 3425.80] Adam
[3425.80 → 3427.44] We are
[3427.44 → 3428.06] In
[3428.06 → 3429.16] Adam
[3429.16 → 3430.72] So that
[3430.72 → 3431.04] When he
[3431.04 → 3431.60] Sinned
[3431.60 → 3433.04] We did
[3433.04 → 3435.34] Now
[3435.34 → 3436.78] As I
[3436.78 → 3437.98] Say that
[3437.98 → 3439.54] I know
[3439.54 → 3440.24] That
[3440.24 → 3442.28] Most
[3442.28 → 3443.22] Of us
[3443.22 → 3444.64] Especially
[3444.64 → 3445.42] In the
[3445.42 → 3445.80] Kind of
[3445.80 → 3446.28] Modern
[3446.28 → 3446.96] Western
[3446.96 → 3447.62] World
[3447.62 → 3448.36] That we
[3448.36 → 3448.86] Live in
[3448.86 → 3449.30] When we
[3449.30 → 3449.86] Hear this
[3449.86 → 3450.40] Idea
[3450.40 → 3452.76] We don't
[3452.76 → 3453.74] Really
[3453.74 → 3454.98] Like it
[3454.98 → 3456.86] In fact
[3456.86 → 3457.72] Maybe we
[3457.72 → 3458.30] Don't even
[3458.30 → 3458.82] Know whether
[3458.82 → 3459.38] We like it
[3459.38 → 3459.76] Or not
[3459.76 → 3460.24] Because we
[3460.24 → 3460.66] Don't even
[3460.66 → 3461.66] Understand it
[3461.66 → 3463.10] It doesn't
[3463.10 → 3464.08] Make sense
[3464.08 → 3465.14] In our
[3465.14 → 3465.62] Frame of
[3465.62 → 3465.94] Being
[3465.94 → 3466.80] Because
[3466.80 → 3469.66] Part of
[3469.66 → 3470.04] The
[3470.04 → 3471.76] Social
[3471.76 → 3472.54] Imaginary
[3472.54 → 3473.08] Part of
[3473.08 → 3473.86] The way
[3473.86 → 3474.24] That we
[3474.24 → 3474.84] Operate
[3474.84 → 3475.14] In the
[3475.14 → 3475.40] World
[3475.40 → 3475.90] Part of
[3475.90 → 3477.26] The underlying
[3477.26 → 3478.56] Assumptions
[3478.56 → 3479.06] About how
[3479.06 → 3479.52] The world
[3479.52 → 3479.84] Works
[3479.84 → 3480.18] That we
[3480.18 → 3480.56] Live
[3480.56 → 3481.18] Out of
[3481.18 → 3482.32] Part of
[3482.32 → 3482.50] What
[3482.50 → 3483.58] The water
[3483.58 → 3484.08] We swim
[3484.08 → 3484.32] In
[3484.32 → 3484.58] Or the
[3484.58 → 3484.76] Air
[3484.76 → 3485.06] That we
[3485.06 → 3485.50] Breathe
[3485.50 → 3486.42] Part of
[3486.42 → 3486.72] That is
[3486.72 → 3487.22] So
[3487.22 → 3488.86] Comprehensively
[3488.86 → 3490.42] Individualistic
[3490.42 → 3490.86] That
[3490.86 → 3491.62] When I
[3491.62 → 3491.96] Talk about
[3491.96 → 3492.40] Somebody
[3492.40 → 3493.32] Representing
[3493.32 → 3493.76] Me
[3493.76 → 3494.48] Completely
[3494.48 → 3494.96] And
[3494.96 → 3496.16] Comprehensively
[3496.16 → 3497.14] Not only
[3497.14 → 3497.54] Is that
[3497.54 → 3497.76] Not
[3497.76 → 3498.38] Fair
[3498.38 → 3499.68] Not only
[3499.68 → 3499.92] Is that
[3499.92 → 3500.10] Not
[3500.10 → 3500.66] Right
[3500.66 → 3501.78] It doesn't
[3501.78 → 3501.96] Even
[3501.96 → 3502.74] Make sense
[3502.74 → 3504.86] Right
[3504.86 → 3505.20] How can
[3505.20 → 3505.78] Someone who
[3505.78 → 3506.38] Is not
[3506.38 → 3506.76] Me
[3506.76 → 3507.86] Stand in
[3507.86 → 3508.40] For me
[3508.40 → 3509.40] How can
[3509.40 → 3509.90] Someone who
[3509.90 → 3510.52] I didn't
[3510.52 → 3510.98] Elect
[3510.98 → 3512.08] Or select
[3512.08 → 3513.08] Or choose
[3513.08 → 3513.78] To represent
[3513.78 → 3514.28] Me
[3514.28 → 3514.96] How can
[3514.96 → 3515.26] They do
[3515.26 → 3515.42] That
[3515.42 → 3515.68] How can
[3515.68 → 3516.18] They claim
[3516.18 → 3516.50] To have
[3516.50 → 3517.00] That kind
[3517.00 → 3517.64] Of authority
[3517.64 → 3518.78] Over me
[3518.78 → 3519.68] Right
[3519.68 → 3519.86] In
[3519.86 → 3520.64] Our modern
[3520.64 → 3521.28] Culture
[3521.28 → 3521.92] In our
[3521.92 → 3522.54] Modern way
[3522.54 → 3523.20] Of living
[3523.20 → 3523.60] In the
[3523.60 → 3523.90] World
[3523.90 → 3525.08] Each
[3525.08 → 3525.82] Person
[3525.82 → 3526.80] Is sort
[3526.80 → 3527.16] Of an
[3527.16 → 3527.58] Island
[3527.58 → 3528.12] Unto
[3528.12 → 3528.72] Themselves
[3528.72 → 3530.06] And
[3530.06 → 3530.38] Yes
[3530.38 → 3531.30] Of course
[3531.30 → 3531.70] We are
[3531.70 → 3532.44] All
[3532.44 → 3534.02] Interconnected
[3534.02 → 3534.58] We all
[3534.58 → 3535.12] Live in
[3535.12 → 3535.78] Communities
[3535.78 → 3536.68] Or clusters
[3536.68 → 3537.78] Of islands
[3537.78 → 3538.12] But
[3538.12 → 3539.22] Fundamentally
[3539.22 → 3539.82] Right
[3539.82 → 3540.60] You're rising
[3540.60 → 3541.32] Or falling
[3541.32 → 3542.00] Your ability
[3542.00 → 3542.78] To succeed
[3542.78 → 3544.16] Your ability
[3544.16 → 3544.56] To get
[3544.56 → 3545.02] Ahead
[3545.02 → 3545.40] We are
[3545.40 → 3545.76] Told
[3545.76 → 3546.70] Is done
[3546.70 → 3547.28] All by
[3547.28 → 3547.68] Your own
[3547.68 → 3548.08] Action
[3548.08 → 3548.58] It's your
[3548.58 → 3548.84] Own
[3548.84 → 3549.34] Decisions
[3549.34 → 3549.70] It's your
[3549.70 → 3549.90] Own
[3549.90 → 3550.60] Responsibility
[3550.60 → 3551.04] It's your
[3551.04 → 3551.20] Own
[3551.20 → 3551.74] Ability
[3551.74 → 3553.16] That's
[3553.16 → 3553.38] The way
[3553.38 → 3553.94] We believe
[3553.94 → 3554.42] The world
[3554.42 → 3555.44] Is built
[3555.44 → 3557.54] And again
[3557.54 → 3558.72] I get it
[3558.72 → 3558.90] Right
[3558.90 → 3559.28] We do
[3559.28 → 3559.70] Exist
[3559.70 → 3560.58] In communities
[3560.58 → 3561.52] But our
[3561.52 → 3562.50] Communities
[3562.50 → 3565.26] Are more
[3565.26 → 3566.16] A voluntary
[3566.16 → 3567.38] Association
[3567.38 → 3569.62] Right
[3569.62 → 3570.04] Than they are
[3570.04 → 3570.76] A representative
[3570.76 → 3571.28] Community
[3571.28 → 3571.76] Even our
[3571.76 → 3572.32] Families
[3572.32 → 3573.10] Right
[3573.10 → 3573.48] You say
[3573.48 → 3574.28] Nobody chooses
[3574.28 → 3574.92] Your family
[3574.92 → 3575.86] But when you
[3575.86 → 3576.68] Hit 20 years
[3576.68 → 3576.96] Old
[3576.96 → 3577.42] Or 18
[3577.42 → 3577.98] Years old
[3577.98 → 3578.34] You can
[3578.34 → 3578.76] Choose not
[3578.76 → 3579.04] To have
[3579.04 → 3579.52] That family
[3579.52 → 3579.86] Anymore
[3579.86 → 3580.16] You can
[3580.16 → 3580.38] Walk
[3580.38 → 3580.68] Away
[3580.68 → 3581.52] Right
[3581.52 → 3581.94] In some
[3581.94 → 3582.16] Way
[3582.16 → 3582.90] The continued
[3582.90 → 3583.66] Relationships
[3583.66 → 3583.96] That we
[3583.96 → 3584.88] Exist in
[3584.88 → 3585.64] Are voluntary
[3585.64 → 3587.02] Right
[3587.02 → 3587.54] We have
[3587.54 → 3588.34] The power
[3588.34 → 3588.84] Or we
[3588.84 → 3589.32] Believe we
[3589.32 → 3589.84] Do anyway
[3589.84 → 3590.28] To say
[3590.28 → 3590.68] Yes
[3590.68 → 3591.70] Or no
[3591.70 → 3593.16] The idea
[3593.16 → 3593.82] That someone
[3593.82 → 3594.42] Else has
[3594.42 → 3594.96] The power
[3594.96 → 3595.36] To say
[3595.36 → 3595.78] Yes or
[3595.78 → 3596.00] No
[3596.00 → 3596.40] On my
[3596.40 → 3596.90] Behalf
[3596.90 → 3597.20] Without
[3597.20 → 3597.78] My giving
[3597.78 → 3598.54] Consent
[3598.54 → 3599.64] Is so
[3599.64 → 3600.12] Foreign
[3600.12 → 3600.82] To us
[3600.82 → 3601.98] It's more
[3601.98 → 3602.62] Triggering
[3602.62 → 3603.14] Than the
[3603.14 → 3603.34] Maple
[3603.34 → 3603.64] Leaves
[3603.64 → 3604.20] Winning
[3604.20 → 3604.48] Against
[3604.48 → 3604.60] The
[3604.60 → 3605.00] Hurricanes
[3605.00 → 3606.88] Or at
[3606.88 → 3607.02] Least
[3607.02 → 3607.42] It is
[3607.42 → 3608.06] When we
[3608.06 → 3608.36] Start to
[3608.36 → 3608.56] Think
[3608.56 → 3609.08] About it
[3609.08 → 3610.24] Because
[3610.24 → 3610.54] We don't
[3610.54 → 3610.82] Normally
[3610.82 → 3611.10] Think
[3611.10 → 3611.58] About it
[3611.58 → 3612.44] We just
[3612.44 → 3612.62] Kind of
[3612.62 → 3613.10] Operate
[3613.10 → 3613.62] Within
[3613.62 → 3613.82] It
[3613.82 → 3615.98] Now
[3615.98 → 3616.98] There are
[3616.98 → 3617.62] Parallels
[3617.62 → 3617.94] Right
[3617.94 → 3618.38] And I'm
[3618.38 → 3618.58] Not
[3618.58 → 3619.68] Unaware
[3619.68 → 3620.20] Of that
[3620.20 → 3621.30] The parallels
[3621.30 → 3621.78] Exist
[3621.78 → 3622.50] When we
[3622.50 → 3622.84] Do
[3622.84 → 3623.28] Give
[3623.28 → 3623.86] Ascent
[3623.86 → 3624.60] That
[3624.60 → 3624.74] That is
[3624.74 → 3625.08] When we
[3625.08 → 3625.34] Do
[3625.34 → 3625.64] Give
[3625.64 → 3626.14] Permission
[3626.14 → 3626.36] To
[3626.36 → 3626.66] Someone
[3626.66 → 3627.16] To

[3660.68 → 3661.22] Practically
[3661.22 → 3661.62] Speaking

[3683.70 → 3686.12] Sometimes
[3686.12 → 3687.10] We think
[3687.10 → 3687.56] About it
[3687.56 → 3689.66] In law
[3689.66 → 3690.04] Or with

[3747.26 → 3747.72] Miss
[3747.72 → 3748.50] Or why
[3748.50 → 3749.12] We miss

[3903.18 → 3903.64] True
[3903.64 → 3906.84] Right
[3906.84 → 3907.06] It's
