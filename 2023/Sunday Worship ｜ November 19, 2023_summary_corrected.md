• They discuss reading through the book of Romans, specifically chapters 9-11
• The passage being read is Romans 11:1-10, which deals with the sovereignty of God and Israel's rejection of the gospel
• Paul asks if God rejected his people and answers that by no means, citing examples from scripture to show that there are still remnants chosen by grace
• God chooses who he will save through faith in the gospel
• Israel's unbelief doesn't mean God has rejected them
• There is a remnant who believe, and the elect will show themselves eventually
• Israel's stumbling was for the purpose of grafting in Gentiles
• Ultimately, all of Israel may be saved by grace through faith
• Israel's unbelief isn't total
• A remnant of Israel currently believes
• Paul is a living example that God hasn't rejected His people
• The story of Elijah shows God's preservation of His people despite their idolatry and rejection of Him
• The presence of the gospel being preached to the Gentiles indicates that God has not entirely rejected Israel
• Discussion of idolatry and syncretism among the Israelites
• Story of Elijah challenging Ahab's prophets of Baal and Ashe rah on a mountaintop
• Paul's use of this story to illustrate that there is a remnant of people who believe in God despite the majority rejecting Him
• Comparison between the rejection of God by the majority of Israel and the current state of Christianity in society, noting that while it may appear to be declining demographically, a cultural Christianity is still prevalent
• The presence of God's work in the world is evident despite appearances to the contrary
• Examples include the conversion of a Hindu priest to Christianity and Ayaan Hirsi Ali's change from being anti-religion to becoming a Christian
• These examples illustrate that God keeps a remnant, often found in unexpected places
• This theme is reflected in the Reformed tradition, specifically through the Belgic Confession
• The confession highlights what it means to be Reformed and includes an article on the Holy Catholic Church that explains this concept
• The church has existed since the beginning of time and will last until the end
• Christ is eternal King who cannot exist without subjects
• The holy church is preserved by God against the rage of the world
• Despite appearances, there is always a remnant of true believers
• Israel's unbelief is not total because grace is still active and faith is a gift of grace
• Rejection of God can be overcome by grace
• Regeneration is necessary for faith and responding to grace
• Baptism is a symbol of the action of God in overcoming rejection through his grace
• Infant baptism is seen as an image of this promise because infants cannot choose God on their own
• Grace is necessary for spiritual life, and none of us can come to God apart from it
• Israel's rejection of God is not necessarily equal to or connected to God's rejection of Israel
• God's grace is more than human efforts and passion, it's what ultimately saves
• The elect among the people of Israel will always reveal themselves, even if it takes a lifetime
• Paul argues that God has sovereign choice over who is saved and foreknew all who would be saved.
• God's plan and purpose can be mysterious and not always understood immediately
• Foreknowledge by God means that people cannot fail to believe
• Faith is often a long-term process, not immediate
• Grace is still present even when faith seems absent
• Israel's relationship with God serves as an analogy for human relationships with God
• Rejection and hope
• The chosen of God will reveal themselves, but it may take a lifetime

• Elevated expectation vs reality of grace conversion
