[567.08 --> 581.64]  To the river I am
[581.64 --> 591.50]  Good morning.
[591.50 --> 591.80]  Good morning.
[593.88 --> 596.78]  Alright, that was pretty awful.
[597.08 --> 597.98]  Good morning.
[599.48 --> 601.04]  Hey, much better.
[601.18 --> 602.98]  Welcome to church.
[603.24 --> 603.92]  My name is Chris.
[604.12 --> 605.84]  I am one of the pastors here.
[606.00 --> 610.70]  And it's my privilege, along with a few others, to lead in worship.
[610.88 --> 614.20]  If you are a regular worshiper here with us and you look around,
[614.32 --> 618.78]  you might see this middle section is filled out a little bit differently today.
[618.78 --> 624.50]  And we are really excited to welcome and to host the Fraser Valley Cadet Clubs.
[624.50 --> 627.88]  And so, boys, counselors, welcome to Emmanuel.
[628.40 --> 631.14]  I hope and pray that today is awesome for you.
[631.56 --> 634.78]  Maybe I should say that today is amazing for you.
[635.32 --> 638.20]  Because amazing is your theme verse.
[638.30 --> 638.96]  More on that later.
[639.70 --> 640.44]  There's going to be a quiz.
[640.44 --> 645.86]  Kevin laughed at me there.
[646.04 --> 646.26]  Anyway.
[647.46 --> 649.24]  It is indeed Cadet Sunday.
[649.38 --> 651.12]  And we're excited to share in that.
[651.22 --> 654.26]  As more people are filing in throughout the course,
[654.38 --> 658.62]  just be mindful that we're going to, we possibly, anyway, are going to be tight this morning.
[658.70 --> 660.36]  So make room for the people around you.
[661.18 --> 663.12]  Before we begin in earnest, there's a couple announcements.
[663.38 --> 664.86]  And so, Josh, I'm going to get you to come up.
[665.24 --> 668.06]  And then while Josh is on his way up, I will just remind you,
[668.38 --> 672.48]  if you're in our youth program, tonight is HCBC.
[672.86 --> 676.00]  And so if you have any questions on what that looks like or times or locations,
[676.56 --> 677.20]  you can get Kevin.
[677.36 --> 678.12]  He will let you know.
[678.12 --> 688.20]  For the young adults today, at 7 p.m., we have Giant Dutch Blitz here.
[688.54 --> 691.80]  It is also a part of our Greater Young Adults Ministry with Willoughby CRC,
[693.10 --> 696.56]  Fleetwood CRC, Maple Ridge CRC, and potentially New Life,
[696.90 --> 699.86]  who are all going to be coming over to play Giant Dutch Blitz
[699.86 --> 702.76]  with our Giant Dutch Blitz cards against our church.
[703.10 --> 706.56]  So, and since we're the ones that own the cards, we need to make sure that we win.
[706.56 --> 710.88]  So I need all of you to go to keep the honor of our church.
[712.60 --> 713.32]  Thank you.
[713.44 --> 715.44]  It's at 7 p.m. here.
[719.46 --> 719.98]  Okay.
[720.34 --> 724.52]  We are going to start our worship together with God's greeting.
[724.72 --> 727.66]  And so I'm going to invite you, as you are able to stand,
[728.58 --> 731.14]  we will receive God's greeting together.
[731.14 --> 737.98]  We gather in the presence of our good God.
[738.06 --> 740.90]  He is in this place with us.
[741.04 --> 743.80]  And so receive his greeting.
[745.46 --> 749.02]  Grace, mercy, and peace to you.
[749.24 --> 753.44]  From God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son, and our Savior,
[753.90 --> 756.28]  through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[756.90 --> 757.68]  All God's people said?
[757.68 --> 758.24]  Amen.
[759.00 --> 759.24]  Amen.
[759.40 --> 763.06]  I'm going to invite you just to take this time to greet those around you
[763.06 --> 764.06]  with whom you are worshiping.
[764.28 --> 766.18]  Handshake, fist bump, however you like.
[766.70 --> 768.38]  Pass the peace of Christ this morning.
[768.38 --> 798.36]  Thank you.
[798.38 --> 828.36]  Thank you.
[828.38 --> 830.38]  I am the Allied Councilor here at Langley Emanuel.
[831.16 --> 836.10]  We're going to begin this morning by inviting the cadets from all clubs to stand up and
[836.10 --> 837.30]  reciting our landmarks.
[837.64 --> 839.62]  And afterwards, I'll lead you through our cadet litany.
[840.58 --> 843.22]  So boys, Councilors, if you could all stand up.

[899.38 --> 904.10]  so our call to worship this morning is based on this year's one word cadet theme amazing
[904.90 --> 910.26]  and this litany based on verses from psalm 8 and psalm 24 acknowledges what an amazing god we have
[913.14 --> 917.62]  okay that's
[919.30 --> 930.42]  the earth is the lord's and everything in it

[1177.22 --> 1185.36]  Lord, I come, I confess
[1185.36 --> 1191.20]  Thou in here I find my rest
[1191.20 --> 1197.30]  And without you I fall apart
[1197.30 --> 1204.36]  You're the one that guides my heart
[1204.36 --> 1212.66]  Lord, I need you, oh, I need you
[1212.66 --> 1218.52]  Every hour I need you
[1218.52 --> 1224.28]  My one defense, my righteousness
[1224.28 --> 1229.42]  Oh God, how I need you
[1229.42 --> 1238.64]  Where sin runs deep, your grace is more
[1238.64 --> 1244.50]  Where grace is found is where you are
[1244.50 --> 1250.42]  And where you are, Lord, I am free
[1250.42 --> 1256.80]  Holiness is Christ in me
[1256.80 --> 1262.00]  And where you are, Lord, I am free
[1262.00 --> 1269.64]  Holiness is Christ in me
[1269.64 --> 1277.74]  Lord, I need you, oh, I need you
[1277.74 --> 1283.44]  Every hour I need you
[1283.44 --> 1289.00]  My one defense, my righteousness
[1289.00 --> 1293.86]  Oh God, how I need you
[1293.86 --> 1298.74]  So teach my song to rise to you
[1298.74 --> 1304.44]  When temptation comes my way
[1304.44 --> 1309.08]  And when I cannot stand, I'll fall on you
[1309.08 --> 1314.24]  Jesus, you're my hope and stay
[1314.24 --> 1319.40]  And when I cannot stand, I'll fall on you
[1319.40 --> 1324.62]  Jesus, you're my hope and stay
[1324.62 --> 1333.86]  Lord, I need you, oh, I need you
[1333.86 --> 1339.46]  Every hour I need you
[1339.46 --> 1344.94]  My one defense, my righteousness
[1344.94 --> 1349.84]  Oh God, how I need you
[1349.84 --> 1356.74]  Lord, I need you, oh, I need you
[1356.74 --> 1362.38]  Every hour I need you
[1362.38 --> 1368.04]  My one defense, my righteousness
[1368.04 --> 1373.76]  Oh God, how I need you
[1373.76 --> 1382.20]  Pray with me
[1382.20 --> 1386.98]  Our Father in heaven, we come before you this morning
[1386.98 --> 1389.34]  Recognizing how much we need you
[1389.34 --> 1393.46]  How much we need your love, your mercy, and your grace
[1393.46 --> 1395.74]  God, each of us has sinned
[1395.74 --> 1398.60]  Whether it be in our thoughts, our words, or our deeds
[1398.60 --> 1402.24]  We are often so concerned with what we think
[1402.24 --> 1404.26]  Are the important things in our lives
[1404.26 --> 1406.46]  That we fail to recognize you
[1406.46 --> 1408.18]  In each of our circumstances
[1408.18 --> 1411.82]  Lord, we confess we have not always loved you
[1411.82 --> 1412.86]  With our whole heart
[1412.86 --> 1414.76]  Nor served you as we should
[1414.76 --> 1417.32]  We have not always loved others
[1417.32 --> 1418.94]  As we have loved ourselves
[1418.94 --> 1422.00]  We have not always been salt and light
[1422.00 --> 1422.96]  In this world
[1422.96 --> 1426.42]  In Romans we read that there is not one of us
[1426.42 --> 1427.28]  Who is righteous
[1427.28 --> 1428.88]  Not one
[1428.88 --> 1432.62]  But Lord, we thank you for the amazing hope
[1432.62 --> 1433.92]  And assurance we have
[1433.92 --> 1436.84]  That righteousness is available to us
[1436.84 --> 1439.30]  Through the faith we have in Christ's death
[1439.30 --> 1440.98]  For us on the cross
[1440.98 --> 1444.06]  That we can have bright hope for tomorrow
[1444.06 --> 1448.10]  Father God, through Jesus we pray for mercy
[1448.10 --> 1449.58]  We pray for your forgiveness
[1449.58 --> 1452.40]  We thank you for your steadfast love
[1452.40 --> 1454.64]  And mercies that never cease
[1454.64 --> 1456.58]  And are new every morning
[1456.58 --> 1459.46]  Great is your faithfulness, oh God
[1459.46 --> 1461.46]  In Jesus' name we pray
[1461.46 --> 1462.56]  Amen
[1462.56 --> 1477.34]  Pour over
[1477.34 --> 1502.04]  Great is thy faithfulness, O God my Father.
[1502.04 --> 1509.66]  There is no shadow of turning with thee.
[1510.32 --> 1517.12]  Thou changest not, thy compassions may fail not.
[1517.38 --> 1523.74]  As thou hast been, thou forever wilt be.
[1523.74 --> 1530.74]  Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[1530.74 --> 1537.74]  Morning by morning new mercies I see.
[1538.68 --> 1544.74]  All I have needed, thy hand hath provided.
[1545.84 --> 1551.92]  Great is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me.
[1551.92 --> 1560.92]  Summer and winter and springtime and harvest.
[1560.92 --> 1566.92]  Sun, moon, and stars in their courses above.
[1566.92 --> 1573.92]  Join with all nature in manifold witness.
[1574.86 --> 1580.92]  To thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.
[1581.92 --> 1587.92]  Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[1587.92 --> 1594.92]  Morning by morning new mercies I see.
[1594.92 --> 1601.92]  All I have needed, thy hand hath provided.
[1601.92 --> 1608.92]  Great is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me.
[1608.92 --> 1609.92]  Lord, unto me.
[1609.92 --> 1617.92]  Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth.

[1894.48 --> 1896.50]  My name is Daryl
[1896.50 --> 1897.26]  I'm one of the leaders
[1897.26 --> 1898.28]  For the Fraser Valley
[1898.28 --> 1899.22]  Regional Cadets
[1899.22 --> 1900.86]  And today's special offering
[1900.86 --> 1902.34]  Is for the Calvinist Cadet Corps
[1902.34 --> 1904.80]  The cadets program's purpose
[1904.80 --> 1905.74]  Is to provide churches
[1905.74 --> 1906.80]  With a unique ministry
[1906.80 --> 1907.96]  That will enable them
[1907.96 --> 1908.96]  To effectively share
[1908.96 --> 1910.06]  Christ's love with boys
[1910.06 --> 1911.70]  In their church and community
[1911.70 --> 1913.90]  It is a joy to be a part
[1913.90 --> 1914.42]  Of the ministry
[1914.42 --> 1915.82]  And see the positive effects
[1915.82 --> 1916.28]  It has
[1916.28 --> 1917.78]  Next week's offering
[1917.78 --> 1919.06]  Is for the friendship ministry
[1919.06 --> 1920.82]  And thank you for your generosity
[1920.82 --> 1922.50]  And support for the cadet program
[1922.50 --> 1935.50]  The splendor of the king
[1935.50 --> 1948.50]  The splendor of the king
[1948.50 --> 1953.50]  Clothed in majesty

[1966.50 --> 1972.50]  And darkness tries to hide
[1972.50 --> 1975.50]  And trembles at his voice
[1975.50 --> 1985.50]  How great is our God
[1985.50 --> 1987.50]  Sing with me
[1987.50 --> 1991.50]  How great is our God
[1991.50 --> 1993.50]  And all will see
[1993.50 --> 1995.50]  How great
[1995.50 --> 2001.50]  How great is our God
[2001.50 --> 2003.50]  Age to age

[2008.50 --> 2009.50]  He stands
[2009.50 --> 2011.50]  And time is in His hands
[2011.50 --> 2016.50]  And time is in His hands
[2016.50 --> 2019.50]  Begin and end
[2019.50 --> 2021.50]  Begin and end
[2021.50 --> 2022.50]  Begin and end
[2022.50 --> 2028.50]  And God hit three in one
[2028.50 --> 2048.50] Ke bЗ
[2048.50 --> 2066.30]  We are worthy of all of this
[2078.50 --> 2091.54]  And my heart will sing how great He's our God, oh He's our name
[2091.54 --> 2103.00]  He's the name above all names You are worthy of all praise
[2103.00 --> 2114.00]  And my heart will sing how great He's our God, oh He's our name
[2114.00 --> 2123.00]  How great, how great He's our God, oh He's our name

[2128.00 --> 2142.00]  And all will see how great, how great He's our God, oh He's our name

[2166.00 --> 2178.00]  You're the name above all names He is worthy of all praise
[2178.00 --> 2186.00]  And my heart will sing how great He's our God, oh He's our name
[2196.00 --> 2202.00]  Good morning everyone, if you are a child and you are age 3 up to grade 4
[2202.00 --> 2206.00]  You can come and join us up at the front here for Kids Corner
[2206.00 --> 2212.00]  And then following that if you're visiting and you have a child within that age who's not a cadet staying here
[2212.00 --> 2217.00]  You're welcome to follow us out for our children's worship time program
[2217.00 --> 2221.00]  I think someone has stolen my seat, can you guys go on the ground?
[2221.00 --> 2223.00]  Oh, so silly, alright
[2223.00 --> 2225.00]  Oh, I don't know
[2225.00 --> 2231.00]  Alright, good morning everybody
[2231.00 --> 2234.00]  Oh, you're so quiet, you're still waking up
[2234.00 --> 2236.00]  Oh, good morning
[2236.00 --> 2242.00]  Today we are going to talk about people that we learn things from
[2242.00 --> 2246.00]  Does anyone here know how to tie their shoes?
[2246.00 --> 2249.00]  Oh, lots of you, who taught you how to tie your shoes?
[2249.00 --> 2251.00]  Your mom
[2251.00 --> 2252.00]  Your mom
[2252.00 --> 2253.00]  Your mom
[2253.00 --> 2254.00]  YouTube
[2254.00 --> 2255.00]  Yeah, yeah
[2255.00 --> 2258.00]  The teacher of the 2023
[2258.00 --> 2264.00]  How about, can anyone do like a somersault or some sort of like cartwheel business?
[2264.00 --> 2265.00]  Yeah, yeah
[2265.00 --> 2267.00]  Who taught you guys how to do that?
[2267.00 --> 2268.00]  Who taught you how to do a cartwheel?
[2268.00 --> 2269.00]  No one?
[2269.00 --> 2272.00]  You just one day were like, I'm going to try doing this
[2272.00 --> 2273.00]  Your friends
[2273.00 --> 2274.00]  Or your mom
[2274.00 --> 2275.00]  Okay
[2275.00 --> 2277.00]  Haley
[2277.00 --> 2284.00]  So we're going to talk about how we can learn from others and how we learn from Jesus
[2284.00 --> 2287.00]  But how he also asks us to teach other people
[2287.00 --> 2291.00]  And so we get to both be taught and also be teachers to other people
[2291.00 --> 2296.00]  So before we go, we'll just stand up quick and do our blessing
[2296.00 --> 2299.00]  And I'll invite everyone here to stand up as well
[2299.00 --> 2303.00]  And to give and receive the blessing for the kids as well
[2303.00 --> 2306.00]  And if you're not sure what we're doing, look around and follow along
[2306.00 --> 2307.00]  It's pretty simple
[2307.00 --> 2308.00]  Simple
[2308.00 --> 2309.00]  Alright, that's it
[2309.00 --> 2310.00]  Alright, that's it
[2310.00 --> 2311.00]  Alright, that's it
[2311.00 --> 2312.00]  One, two, three
[2312.00 --> 2314.00]  And also with you
[2314.00 --> 2342.00]  Good morning
[2342.00 --> 2343.00]  Good morning
[2343.00 --> 2344.00]  My name is Dave
[2344.00 --> 2346.00]  I'm one of the elders at our church
[2346.00 --> 2350.00]  And it is my turn to lead us in our church family prayer
[2350.00 --> 2353.00]  A couple of announcements before we do so
[2353.00 --> 2358.00]  We have been praying for Leanne's dad, my father-in-law for the last little while
[2358.00 --> 2359.00]  As he deals with cancer
[2359.00 --> 2365.00]  And for a while we were expecting a very short time with us
[2365.00 --> 2368.00]  He's been hanging around a lot longer than anyone expected
[2368.00 --> 2371.00]  And they've decided that treatment is a good option after all
[2371.00 --> 2373.00]  So there's some progress
[2373.00 --> 2378.00]  We get word that Ellen White fell and injured her knee
[2378.00 --> 2381.00]  Movement is even more difficult than normal for her
[2381.00 --> 2385.00]  She may need some assistance
[2385.00 --> 2387.00]  Please keep her in your prayers
[2387.00 --> 2391.00]  And we've been told that Peter Rollman's uncle Art
[2391.00 --> 2395.00]  Was killed in a serious car crash yesterday
[2395.00 --> 2399.00]  They were on their way home to Ontario from visiting BC
[2399.00 --> 2402.00]  His aunt Jeanette is in hospital recovering
[2402.00 --> 2409.00]  We pray for the peace of Christ in the midst of grief and mourning and questions to God
[2409.00 --> 2412.00]  Shall we pray to our Father?
[2412.00 --> 2419.00]  Father, it is good that we are all here
[2419.00 --> 2421.00]  This is the day that you have made
[2421.00 --> 2423.00]  We rejoice and we are glad in it
[2423.00 --> 2425.00]  It is very good for us to be here
[2425.00 --> 2428.00]  We come together on this Sunday to celebrate your name
[2428.00 --> 2432.00]  And on this Lord's Day we gather with Christians everywhere
[2432.00 --> 2435.00]  To hear your word and to sing your praises
[2435.00 --> 2439.00]  We praise you and we celebrate your goodness in our lives
[2439.00 --> 2443.00]  Father, in this time of confession
[2443.00 --> 2446.00]  We confess our sins and our failings
[2446.00 --> 2449.00]  We have not lived up to what you require of us
[2449.00 --> 2453.00]  We do not act justly, love mercy, or walk humbly with our God
[2453.00 --> 2456.00]  We confess that we still have our idols
[2456.00 --> 2462.00]  Whether it be money, career, possessions, politics, ideology
[2462.00 --> 2467.00]  Anything that we give preeminence to rather than to you
[2467.00 --> 2471.00]  Help us to remember to focus our attention on you
[2471.00 --> 2475.00]  Because in you we live and breathe and have our being
[2475.00 --> 2479.00]  Father, we thank you for the good things in our lives
[2479.00 --> 2481.00]  We thank you for the weather that we have today
[2481.00 --> 2484.00]  Where we can see the blue sky and to enjoy your creation
[2484.00 --> 2487.00]  And we say that this is the day that the Lord has made
[2487.00 --> 2490.00]  We rejoice and be glad in it
[2490.00 --> 2493.00]  Father, we thank you for the leadership of our church
[2493.00 --> 2495.00]  And thank you for Pastor Chris and Pastor Kevin
[2495.00 --> 2499.00]  We ask that you help them to faithfully share your word with us
[2499.00 --> 2503.00]  We thank you for the many ministries and many volunteers that we have in our church
[2503.00 --> 2512.00]  Whether it be nursery, children's worship time, gems, youth, young adults, coffee break, care groups, seniors, and men's groups
[2512.00 --> 2517.00]  Particularly, we thank you for the cadets and the Calvinist Cadet Corps
[2517.00 --> 2523.00]  An organization where men can help boys to be more Christ-like in all areas of life
[2523.00 --> 2527.00]  And to help them to live for Jesus in all that they do
[2527.00 --> 2531.00]  Father, we thank you for the theme verse that we could have today
[2531.00 --> 2533.00]  Coming from Joshua
[2533.00 --> 2537.00]  Where as they enter, as the Israelites enter the Promised Land
[2537.00 --> 2541.00]  And as we take part in your kingdom
[2541.00 --> 2545.00]  Like the Israelites, we consecrate ourselves
[2545.00 --> 2550.00]  For tomorrow you will do amazing things among us, for us, and through us
[2550.00 --> 2558.00]  Father, we continue to pray for the needs and concerns that our congregation, our greater community, and the world has
[2558.00 --> 2563.00]  We pray again for the war in Ukraine, with the unrest that we have there
[2563.00 --> 2566.00]  All the people who are suffering from the hardship of war
[2566.00 --> 2570.00]  As we think about the escalation that happens
[2570.00 --> 2573.00]  And pondering what Western involvement could be
[2573.00 --> 2577.00]  We pray that you will be at that troubled place as they go through this troubled time
[2577.00 --> 2580.00]  Father, we pray for Margaret De Vries
[2580.00 --> 2582.00]  We think about Margaret De Vries
[2582.00 --> 2586.00]  A founding member of this church who has passed on
[2586.00 --> 2588.00]  She was known and loved by many
[2588.00 --> 2590.00]  We thank you for the life that she could lead
[2590.00 --> 2594.00]  We ask that you be with the family as they go through a time of grieving
[2594.00 --> 2602.00]  We think about Jackie Birkenpass with getting her CAT scan to pinpoint the correct location of her cancer
[2602.00 --> 2607.00]  And we pray for wisdom and insight that they will be able to figure out what is the next step in her treatment
[2607.00 --> 2610.00]  We pray for Benita Smith
[2610.00 --> 2617.00]  We thank you for the good news that currently they cannot locate any mass of cancer
[2617.00 --> 2621.00]  We pray that you will keep watch over her as she watches over her health
[2621.00 --> 2628.00]  We think about the passing of Helen Hanson, Maria Grimm's stepmother
[2628.00 --> 2631.00]  And we pray that they will feel your comfort too
[2631.00 --> 2637.00]  We pray for Terry Meshaw, Leanne's father
[2637.00 --> 2642.00]  We thank you for her bit of progress as he continues to face his illness and face his cancer
[2642.00 --> 2645.00]  We pray that you will be very close to them
[2645.00 --> 2648.00]  We think about Ellen White who fell and injured her knee
[2648.00 --> 2652.00]  We, it will be, she will be immobile for a little while
[2652.00 --> 2657.00]  We pray that you will be with her as she goes through that recovery
[2657.00 --> 2660.00]  And that she will feel the love and presence of people around her
[2660.00 --> 2662.00]  And that she will feel it from you too
[2662.00 --> 2667.00]  And we think about the serious accident for Art and Jeanette
[2667.00 --> 2671.00]  With the loss of Art's life
[2671.00 --> 2674.00]  It's difficult news to hear
[2674.00 --> 2677.00]  We pray that you will be with Peter and everyone in his family
[2677.00 --> 2680.00]  That they will feel your love and your presence
[2680.00 --> 2683.00]  Father, we pray for us too
[2683.00 --> 2686.00]  We look forward to this service ahead for this Cadet Sunday
[2686.00 --> 2690.00]  And the theme that we get to experience
[2690.00 --> 2693.00]  Because you are amazing
[2693.00 --> 2695.00]  Amen
[2710.00 --> 2720.00]  Early in the morning, Joshua and all the Israelites set out from Shittim and went to the Jordan
[2720.00 --> 2723.00]  Where they camped before crossing over
[2723.00 --> 2728.00]  After three days, the officers went throughout the camp, giving orders to the people
[2728.00 --> 2731.00]  When you see the ark of the covenant
[2731.00 --> 2734.00]  The Lord your God and the Levitical priests carrying it
[2734.00 --> 2737.00]  You are to move out from your positions and follow it
[2737.00 --> 2740.00]  Then you will know which way to go
[2740.00 --> 2742.00]  Since you have never been this way before
[2742.00 --> 2746.00]  But keep a distance of about 2,000 cubits
[2746.00 --> 2747.00]  Between you and the ark
[2747.00 --> 2749.00]  Do not go near it
[2749.00 --> 2750.00]  Joshua told the people
[2750.00 --> 2753.00]  Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow
[2753.00 --> 2755.00]  The Lord will do amazing things among you
[2755.00 --> 2758.00]  Joshua said to the priests
[2758.00 --> 2760.00]  Take up the ark of the covenant
[2760.00 --> 2762.00]  And pass on ahead of the people
[2762.00 --> 2764.00]  So they took it up and went ahead of them
[2764.00 --> 2766.00]  And the Lord said to Joshua
[2766.00 --> 2769.00]  Today I will begin to exalt you
[2769.00 --> 2771.00]  In the eyes of all Israel
[2771.00 --> 2773.00]  So they may know that I am with you
[2773.00 --> 2776.00]  As I was with Moses
[2776.00 --> 2779.00]  Tell the priests who carry the ark of the covenant
[2779.00 --> 2782.00]  When you reach the edge of the Jordan's waters
[2782.00 --> 2785.00]  Go and stand in the river
[2788.00 --> 2790.00]  Joshua said to the Israelites
[2790.00 --> 2793.00]  Come here and listen to the words of the Lord your God
[2793.00 --> 2797.00]  This is how you will know that the living God is among you
[2797.00 --> 2800.00]  And that he will certainly drive out before you
[2800.00 --> 2802.00]  The Canaanites
[2802.00 --> 2803.00]  The Hittites
[2803.00 --> 2804.00]  The Hivites
[2804.00 --> 2805.00]  The Perizzites
[2805.00 --> 2806.00]  The Gassizites
[2806.00 --> 2807.00]  The Amorites
[2807.00 --> 2808.00]  The Amorites
[2808.00 --> 2809.00]  And The Jebusites
[2809.00 --> 2811.00]  See the ark of the covenant
[2811.00 --> 2814.00]  Of the Lord of all the earth
[2814.00 --> 2816.00]  Will go into the Jordan ahead of you
[2816.00 --> 2820.00]  Now then choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel
[2820.00 --> 2822.00]  One from each tribe
[2822.00 --> 2826.00]  And as soon as the priests who carry the ark of the Lord
[2826.00 --> 2830.00]  The Lord of all the earth set foot in the Jordan
[2830.00 --> 2833.00]  Its waters flowing downstream will be cut off
[2833.00 --> 2835.00]  And stand up in a heap
[2835.00 --> 2840.00]  So when the people broke camp to cross the Jordan
[2840.00 --> 2844.00]  The priests carrying the ark of the covenant went ahead of them
[2844.00 --> 2849.00]  Now the Jordan is at flood stage all during harvest
[2849.00 --> 2854.00]  Yet as soon as the priests who carried the ark reached the Jordan
[2854.00 --> 2856.00]  And their feet touched the water's end
[2856.00 --> 2859.00]  The water from upstream stopped flowing
[2859.00 --> 2863.00]  It piled up in a heap a great distance away
[2863.00 --> 2865.00]  At a town called Adam
[2865.00 --> 2868.00]  In a vincity of Zerathen
[2868.00 --> 2873.00]  While the water flowing down to the sea of Abra
[2873.00 --> 2876.00]  That is the dead sea was completely cut off
[2876.00 --> 2880.00]  So the people crossed over opposite Jericho
[2880.00 --> 2884.00]  The priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord
[2884.00 --> 2886.00]  Stopped in the middle of the Jordan
[2886.00 --> 2888.00]  And stood on dry ground
[2888.00 --> 2891.00]  While all Israel passed
[2891.00 --> 2894.00]  Until the whole nation had completely crossed
[2894.00 --> 2897.00]  Crossing on dry ground
[2903.00 --> 2918.00]  That was Joshua 3
[2918.00 --> 2921.00]  Thanks Austin and Caleb for reading that so well
[2921.00 --> 2924.00]  Caleb, or Austin sorry, came up to me before the service
[2924.00 --> 2927.00]  And he's like, look at all the names I have to say
[2927.00 --> 2929.00]  I told him he could skip it
[2929.00 --> 2931.00]  But he did a great job
[2931.00 --> 2934.00]  Excellent work, thank you
[2934.00 --> 2937.00]  As we had read for us
[2937.00 --> 2941.00]  We're going to look at the story that comes in Joshua 3
[2941.00 --> 2944.00]  And in particular our verse
[2944.00 --> 2946.00]  We've already said it this morning
[2946.00 --> 2948.00]  In our time together
[2948.00 --> 2952.00]  And the theme for the boys this year
[2952.00 --> 2954.00]  Is amazing
[2954.00 --> 2956.00]  And as I understand it
[2956.00 --> 2959.00]  As I've looked at your material for the year
[2959.00 --> 2961.00]  And at the stuff that you guys have been talking about
[2961.00 --> 2965.00]  What I understand that to be
[2965.00 --> 2967.00]  And to focus on
[2967.00 --> 2969.00]  Is for us and for you boys
[2969.00 --> 2974.00]  To see how amazing God is
[2974.00 --> 2980.00]  And how God has done amazing things in the world
[2980.00 --> 2984.00]  And will do amazing things in you and with you
[2984.00 --> 2990.00]  The theme that we are going to focus on then this morning
[2990.00 --> 2992.00]  Continues that
[2992.00 --> 2996.00]  And I wonder, is there a cadet here
[2996.00 --> 2999.00]  Who has that verse memorized?
[2999.00 --> 3002.00]  Joshua 3 verse 5
[3002.00 --> 3005.00]  Do any of you have it memorized?
[3009.00 --> 3010.00]  Some of the counselors are like
[3010.00 --> 3012.00]  I know one of you does
[3012.00 --> 3017.00]  Alright, can we put it on the screen?
[3017.00 --> 3020.00]  Joshua told the people
[3020.00 --> 3023.00]  Consecrate yourselves
[3023.00 --> 3029.00]  For tomorrow the Lord will do amazing things among you
[3029.00 --> 3032.00]  Now the idea, right
[3032.00 --> 3035.00]  Is that God will do amazing things
[3035.00 --> 3039.00]  For and with and among his people
[3039.00 --> 3044.00]  And his people need to be ready for it
[3046.00 --> 3048.00]  And that's what Joshua is saying
[3048.00 --> 3050.00]  Consecrate yourselves
[3050.00 --> 3052.00]  Now that's a word that we don't normally use
[3052.00 --> 3054.00]  Although you cadets use it
[3054.00 --> 3055.00]  Right?
[3055.00 --> 3057.00]  A cadet must be
[3057.00 --> 3058.00]  Reverent
[3058.00 --> 3059.00]  Obedient
[3059.00 --> 3061.00]  Consecrated
[3061.00 --> 3064.00]  How many of you know what that word means
[3064.00 --> 3065.00]  Every time you say it?
[3067.00 --> 3069.00]  How many of you counselors know what that word means
[3069.00 --> 3071.00]  Every time you make the boys say it?
[3071.00 --> 3073.00]  Sort of?
[3073.00 --> 3074.00]  Maybe?
[3074.00 --> 3075.00]  Maybe?
[3075.00 --> 3077.00]  So consecrated
[3077.00 --> 3079.00]  That means to be set apart
[3079.00 --> 3080.00]  Right?
[3080.00 --> 3081.00]  To be set apart
[3081.00 --> 3082.00]  For a purpose
[3083.00 --> 3085.00]  To be made holy
[3085.00 --> 3087.00]  Actually in Hebrew
[3087.00 --> 3088.00]  The word shares a root
[3088.00 --> 3090.00]  With the word that we also translate
[3090.00 --> 3091.00]  Holy
[3092.00 --> 3093.00]  And so God is saying
[3093.00 --> 3095.00]  Set yourselves apart
[3095.00 --> 3096.00]  Be ready
[3096.00 --> 3099.00]  Because I'm going to do amazing things
[3099.00 --> 3102.00]  I want you to be ready to see
[3102.00 --> 3104.00]  What I am going to do
[3104.00 --> 3105.00]  And so that when you see it
[3105.00 --> 3107.00]  You can know that it is me
[3107.00 --> 3108.00]  God
[3108.00 --> 3109.00]  Doing those things
[3111.00 --> 3115.00]  And so God wants us to be able to recognize him
[3116.00 --> 3118.00]  And he wants you to know
[3118.00 --> 3120.00]  What he is asking of you
[3121.00 --> 3124.00]  That's what the story in Joshua 3 is about
[3124.00 --> 3127.00]  That's what's going on in that text
[3127.00 --> 3129.00]  And so for the rest of you
[3129.00 --> 3131.00]  I'm going to sort of focus in on the boys this morning
[3131.00 --> 3133.00]  And you guys get to listen in on that conversation
[3134.00 --> 3136.00]  I trust that you'll find a way to make it applicable
[3137.00 --> 3138.00]  To your lives
[3139.00 --> 3140.00]  And if you can't
[3140.00 --> 3141.00]  Well then talk to the boys
[3141.00 --> 3142.00]  They'll tell you how to do it
[3144.00 --> 3145.00]  Now here's what I know guys
[3146.00 --> 3148.00]  Sometimes when we read Bible stories like this
[3149.00 --> 3150.00]  It's really easy to forget
[3151.00 --> 3152.00]  That it actually happened
[3153.00 --> 3154.00]  That this story
[3155.00 --> 3156.00]  Took place in the world
[3156.00 --> 3157.00]  That it's not just a story
[3158.00 --> 3159.00]  But it's history
[3159.00 --> 3160.00]  That it happened in a real place
[3161.00 --> 3162.00]  At a real time
[3163.00 --> 3164.00]  But because it was like
[3165.00 --> 3167.00]  3,000 or 3,500 years ago
[3168.00 --> 3170.00]  Sometimes it's really hard to remember that
[3171.00 --> 3172.00]  To make that connection
[3173.00 --> 3174.00]  And so to start for you
[3175.00 --> 3176.00]  I want you to see it
[3177.00 --> 3178.00]  And so Tara can we put the first
[3179.00 --> 3180.00]  So who knows what this is
[3181.00 --> 3182.00]  Just shout it out
[3183.00 --> 3184.00]  Earth
[3184.00 --> 3185.00]  Earth
[3185.00 --> 3186.00]  Earth
[3186.00 --> 3187.00]  Excellent. Now first thing to notice
[3187.00 --> 3188.00]  Look it's round
[3190.00 --> 3191.00]  Now right in the middle of Earth
[3192.00 --> 3193.00]  From this vantage point
[3194.00 --> 3195.00]  Right there
[3197.00 --> 3198.00]  Israel, thank you
[3199.00 --> 3200.00]  We got a keener up front
[3200.00 --> 3201.00]  I'm going to zone in on you now
[3202.00 --> 3203.00]  You're my guy
[3204.00 --> 3205.00]  That's right, right here is Israel
[3206.00 --> 3207.00]  Now what I want you to pay particular attention to
[3208.00 --> 3210.00]  Is what color is all of this?
[3210.00 --> 3211.00]  Brown
[3211.00 --> 3212.00]  Why do you think that is?
[3213.00 --> 3214.00]  Desert.
[3215.00 --> 3216.00]  Very good. Okay, so remember
[3217.00 --> 3218.00]  Israel in the middle of a desert
[3219.00 --> 3220.00]  Next picture, we're going to zoom in just a little bit
[3221.00 --> 3222.00]  So this is
[3223.00 --> 3224.00]  Here, Israel
[3225.00 --> 3226.00]  The region that we're talking about
[3227.00 --> 3228.00]  Is right up here
[3229.00 --> 3230.00]  So this little piece of water
[3231.00 --> 3232.00]  Anyone know what that one is?
[3232.00 --> 3233.00]  It was mentioned in our text
[3233.00 --> 3234.00]  I'm going to go to this side now
[3234.00 --> 3239.00]  The Jordan River flows down into this lake
[3240.00 --> 3241.00]  Or I'll say sea
[3243.00 --> 3244.00]  Dead sea
[3244.00 --> 3245.00]  Very good
[3246.00 --> 3248.00]  Now, did you know the Dead Sea is called the Dead Sea
[3249.00 --> 3251.00]  Because it is so salinated
[3252.00 --> 3253.00]  That it is so full of salt
[3254.00 --> 3255.00]  That if you drink just a glass full of it
[3256.00 --> 3257.00]  You will die
[3257.00 --> 3258.00]  Your insides will shrivel up
[3259.00 --> 3261.00]  Because it sucks all the moisture out of your body
[3262.00 --> 3265.00]  So imagine, okay, here's the context of the story
[3266.00 --> 3267.00]  You are the Israelites
[3268.00 --> 3270.00]  You have left Egypt, which is this beautiful fertile place over here
[3271.00 --> 3273.00]  You've wandered down here to somewhere around Mount Sinai
[3274.00 --> 3275.00]  You came up to the land
[3276.00 --> 3277.00]  You failed God's provisions
[3278.00 --> 3280.00]  And so you had to wander all through this region for 40 years
[3281.00 --> 3283.00]  Not a whole lot of water to be found
[3283.00 --> 3285.00]  That isn't this down here
[3286.00 --> 3287.00]  The Gulf of Aqaba is also salty water
[3288.00 --> 3289.00]  Right?
[3289.00 --> 3290.00]  Not a whole lot of drinkable water to be found throughout here
[3291.00 --> 3293.00]  And then you come up to this region over here
[3294.00 --> 3297.00]  And you see this beautiful, massive lake of gorgeous water
[3298.00 --> 3299.00]  And you run down
[3300.00 --> 3302.00]  Because you haven't seen so much water in 40 years
[3303.00 --> 3304.00]  And you take a drink of it
[3305.00 --> 3306.00]  And you spit it out
[3307.00 --> 3308.00]  Hopefully you don't drink so much that you die
[3309.00 --> 3310.00]  Right?
[3311.00 --> 3312.00]  So here they are
[3312.00 --> 3313.00]  Okay, let's go to the next one
[3314.00 --> 3315.00]  Alright, so here again
[3316.00 --> 3317.00]  Now we've turned it into a map
[3318.00 --> 3319.00]  Right?
[3319.00 --> 3320.00]  Is the Dead Sea
[3320.00 --> 3321.00]  So you can see exactly where we're happening
[3322.00 --> 3323.00]  Right here
[3324.00 --> 3325.00]  Is where the Israelites would have camped
[3326.00 --> 3327.00]  This is Mount Nebo
[3327.00 --> 3328.00]  We didn't read about it in our story
[3329.00 --> 3330.00]  But this is where Moses meets with God
[3331.00 --> 3333.00]  Because Moses isn't allowed to enter into the Promised Land
[3334.00 --> 3336.00]  But when he has his leadership exchange with Joshua
[3337.00 --> 3338.00]  That's where that takes place
[3338.00 --> 3341.00]  Moses goes up Mount Nebo to be with the Lord
[3341.00 --> 3343.00]  Probably where he died or where his body is buried
[3344.00 --> 3345.00]  And the Israelites camp right here
[3346.00 --> 3347.00]  And then across the Jordan River
[3348.00 --> 3349.00]  Which runs here
[3350.00 --> 3351.00]  Is the city of Jericho
[3352.00 --> 3355.00]  That's the first city that they're about to enter into
[3356.00 --> 3357.00]  Okay?
[3357.00 --> 3358.00]  The next one
[3359.00 --> 3360.00]  Tara, next slide
[3361.00 --> 3362.00]  Alright, so this
[3362.00 --> 3364.00]  It's hard to see because this picture was taken at dusk
[3365.00 --> 3370.00]  But this is from when I was in Israel with my wife and a group of other pastors
[3371.00 --> 3372.00]  And we are standing on Mount Nebo
[3373.00 --> 3376.00]  And right here is the valley where the Israelites would have camped
[3377.00 --> 3378.00]  And over here you can barely see it
[3378.00 --> 3380.00]  But that's the northern edge of the Dead Sea
[3381.00 --> 3382.00]  And then running through here
[3383.00 --> 3385.00]  Is the Jordan River
[3386.00 --> 3387.00]  Now again, it's hard to see
[3388.00 --> 3389.00]  But this is all desert
[3390.00 --> 3392.00]  And this is where they would have camped
[3393.00 --> 3394.00]  And where we pick up our story
[3395.00 --> 3397.00]  As they wait to cross the Jordan River
[3398.00 --> 3399.00]  And get into the land
[3400.00 --> 3402.00]  Now again, it's a desert
[3403.00 --> 3405.00]  And they're waiting to cross the Jordan
[3405.00 --> 3407.00]  And Joshua says to the Israelites
[3408.00 --> 3410.00]  Verse 9, if you have your Bibles and are following along
[3411.00 --> 3413.00]  Come here and listen to the words of the Lord your God
[3414.00 --> 3417.00]  This is how you will know that the living God is among you
[3418.00 --> 3419.00]  And that he will certainly drive out before you
[3420.00 --> 3424.00]  The Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites
[3425.00 --> 3427.00]  See the ark of the covenant of the Lord
[3428.00 --> 3430.00]  And of all the earth will go into the Jordan ahead of you
[3430.00 --> 3435.00]  Now then, he says, choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel
[3436.00 --> 3437.00]  One from each tribe
[3438.00 --> 3439.00]  And as soon as the priests who carry the ark of the Lord
[3440.00 --> 3442.00]  The Lord of all the earth set foot in the Jordan
[3443.00 --> 3445.00]  Its waters will stop flowing downstream
[3446.00 --> 3447.00]  And will be cut off
[3448.00 --> 3450.00]  And stand up in a heap
[3451.00 --> 3456.00]  God says, this is how you will know
[3456.00 --> 3461.00]  God is proving himself to his people
[3462.00 --> 3463.00]  He's proving his protection
[3464.00 --> 3465.00]  He's proving his purpose
[3466.00 --> 3467.00]  He's proving his plan
[3468.00 --> 3469.00]  He's proving his choosing of them
[3470.00 --> 3471.00]  And his being with them
[3472.00 --> 3475.00]  Right? And he's done this for them countless times before
[3476.00 --> 3478.00]  Again, think of where the Israelites have just come from
[3479.00 --> 3480.00]  Right? They've spent forty years
[3480.00 --> 3482.00]  wandering in the desert wilderness
[3483.00 --> 3485.00]  Having to depend on God for everything
[3486.00 --> 3487.00]  And I gotta tell you
[3488.00 --> 3489.00]  Right? If you've never been to a desert
[3490.00 --> 3491.00]  The desert is death
[3492.00 --> 3493.00]  Right? Without God
[3494.00 --> 3495.00]  A group that large
[3495.00 --> 3496.00]  Probably numbering somewhere around two million
[3497.00 --> 3498.00]  By conservative estimates
[3499.00 --> 3500.00]  Would never have been able to survive
[3501.00 --> 3502.00]  Unless God had provided for them
[3503.00 --> 3505.00]  And so when we read this story
[3505.00 --> 3510.00]  Right? The author here wants you to think about another story
[3511.00 --> 3514.00]  Another time that God provided for his people
[3515.00 --> 3519.00]  Do you remember a story about God stopping water and them crossing on dry ground?
[3520.00 --> 3521.00]  Anyone? Yep?
[3522.00 --> 3524.00]  The Red Sea or the Sea of Reeds
[3525.00 --> 3526.00]  That's right, some forty years before
[3527.00 --> 3528.00]  Forty-three or forty-five years before
[3529.00 --> 3530.00]  The people were leaving Egypt
[3530.00 --> 3531.00]  And Pharaoh had finally let them go
[3532.00 --> 3533.00]  And they leave and they travel
[3534.00 --> 3537.00]  And they come to another impossibly large body of water
[3538.00 --> 3540.00]  They cannot cross it on their own
[3541.00 --> 3544.00]  And as soon as they reach this body of water
[3545.00 --> 3546.00]  About then, Pharaoh has a change of heart
[3547.00 --> 3548.00]  And he says, no, I want them back
[3549.00 --> 3550.00]  So he sends his armies out to get them
[3551.00 --> 3552.00]  And to gather them and to take them back
[3553.00 --> 3554.00]  And so they have the water in front of them
[3555.00 --> 3556.00]  And the armies of Pharaoh behind them
[3557.00 --> 3560.00]  Now God moves in between in the story
[3561.00 --> 3563.00]  And he blocks Pharaoh's army from being able to see
[3564.00 --> 3565.00]  And then a wind picks up and it blows all night
[3566.00 --> 3568.00]  And when they look again in the morning
[3569.00 --> 3570.00]  The sea in front of them
[3571.00 --> 3572.00]  The Sea of Reeds in front of them
[3573.00 --> 3574.00]  Has a path cut through
[3575.00 --> 3576.00]  Where there's dry ground for them to walk on
[3577.00 --> 3578.00]  Long enough and wide enough for the whole people to walk through
[3579.00 --> 3580.00]  And get to the other side
[3581.00 --> 3583.00]  Now that moment, them walking through
[3583.00 --> 3585.00]  Right, at that moment
[3585.00 --> 3588.00]  Helped to solidify Moses as their leader
[3589.00 --> 3592.00]  Fast forward 45 years later
[3593.00 --> 3596.00]  This moment will help solidify Joshua
[3597.00 --> 3598.00]  As the new leader of the people
[3599.00 --> 3601.00]  Right, in verse 7
[3602.00 --> 3603.00]  God says to Joshua
[3604.00 --> 3606.00]  Today I will begin to exalt you in the eyes of all Israel
[3607.00 --> 3611.00]  So that they may know that I am with you as I was with Moses
[3611.00 --> 3614.00]  And so, here they stand
[3615.00 --> 3616.00]  Recalling that history
[3616.00 --> 3618.00]  With this impossible amount of water in front of them
[3619.00 --> 3620.00]  When the people broke camp
[3621.00 --> 3622.00]  Verse 14
[3623.00 --> 3624.00]  To cross the Jordan
[3624.00 --> 3625.00]  The priests carrying the Ark of the Covenant
[3626.00 --> 3627.00]  Went ahead of them
[3628.00 --> 3629.00]  Now the Jordan is at flood stage
[3630.00 --> 3631.00]  All during harvest
[3632.00 --> 3633.00]  Yet as soon as the priests who carried the Ark reached the Jordan
[3634.00 --> 3635.00]  And their feet touched the water's edge
[3636.00 --> 3638.00]  The water from upstream stopped flowing
[3638.00 --> 3640.00]  Now
[3641.00 --> 3643.00]  You need eyes to see it
[3644.00 --> 3647.00]  But there's this something amazing happening in this text
[3648.00 --> 3649.00]  Right?
[3649.00 --> 3652.00]  It said that the Jordan is at flood stage all during harvest
[3653.00 --> 3655.00]  Now there are a bunch of clues in this story
[3656.00 --> 3657.00]  That tell us when it happened
[3658.00 --> 3662.00]  And that it took place sometime during mid-March or early April
[3662.00 --> 3664.00]  So in the book of Joshua
[3665.00 --> 3666.00]  If we look in chapter 4 verse 19
[3667.00 --> 3668.00]  Which is the next part of this story
[3669.00 --> 3670.00]  So it's the same event
[3671.00 --> 3672.00]  Still part of the same story
[3673.00 --> 3675.00]  It tells us actually that it was on the tenth day of the first month
[3676.00 --> 3677.00]  Which in the Hebrew calendar is Abib
[3678.00 --> 3679.00]  Or Nisan
[3680.00 --> 3682.00]  Which in our calendar is the end of March or early April
[3683.00 --> 3686.00]  The second way that we can know that when this happened
[3686.00 --> 3691.00]  Is because we know that the barley harvest and the flax harvest
[3692.00 --> 3693.00]  Come up together in this region
[3694.00 --> 3695.00]  They happen at the same time
[3696.00 --> 3698.00]  Now three days before the story that we read
[3699.00 --> 3701.00]  Another really famous story in the book of Joshua happens in Joshua 2
[3702.00 --> 3704.00]  Right? You hear about two spies who sneak into Jericho
[3705.00 --> 3707.00]  Right? So they can go see what's going on there
[3708.00 --> 3710.00]  And the people who live there found out about them
[3710.00 --> 3712.00]  And the spies have to hide and they go to someone's house
[3713.00 --> 3714.00]  Anyone?
[3716.00 --> 3717.00]  Rahab's house, that's right
[3718.00 --> 3719.00]  And Rahab has to hide them
[3720.00 --> 3721.00]  She hides them on the roof of her house
[3721.00 --> 3723.00]  Which is built into the famous walls around Jericho
[3723.00 --> 3724.00]  What does she hide them under?
[3725.00 --> 3726.00]  Flax
[3727.00 --> 3728.00]  That's right
[3729.00 --> 3731.00]  She hides them under the recently harvested flax
[3732.00 --> 3733.00]  That would be on her roof drying out
[3734.00 --> 3737.00]  This happens at the same time as the barley harvest
[3737.00 --> 3738.00]  End of March
[3739.00 --> 3740.00]  Early April
[3741.00 --> 3742.00]  Now why does that matter?
[3743.00 --> 3744.00]  Because if that's the timeframe
[3745.00 --> 3747.00]  Right? At this time of year
[3748.00 --> 3750.00]  In that region, the snow from Mount Hermon
[3751.00 --> 3752.00]  Which is way to the north in the Lebanese mountain range
[3753.00 --> 3755.00]  Would run down into the Jordan
[3756.00 --> 3758.00]  And then the rainy season is just finishing
[3759.00 --> 3762.00]  And so the rivers that would have been developed over the rainy season
[3763.00 --> 3764.00]  Are all filling into the Jordan
[3764.00 --> 3768.00]  And this makes the river spill over its banks
[3769.00 --> 3771.00]  And not just the first level of banks
[3772.00 --> 3773.00]  But the second level
[3773.00 --> 3774.00]  And the third level of banks
[3775.00 --> 3778.00]  Now I love little historical tidbits here
[3779.00 --> 3780.00]  Like you can see in the story
[3780.00 --> 3782.00]  Because it makes the Bible even more real to me
[3783.00 --> 3786.00]  And it shows us a more real picture of God
[3786.00 --> 3792.00]  And so when we read that the Jordan is at flood stage during harvest
[3793.00 --> 3797.00]  And even that actually isn't enough of what's going on
[3798.00 --> 3802.00]  In Hebrew again, it says the Jordan overflowed all its banks all of harvest
[3803.00 --> 3806.00]  And this isn't just an ordinary snow melt
[3807.00 --> 3809.00]  This is an extraordinary season
[3809.00 --> 3813.00]  Now if you go to the Jordan River today
[3814.00 --> 3817.00]  It pales in comparison to what it used to be
[3818.00 --> 3819.00]  Especially during harvest season
[3820.00 --> 3823.00]  Today, some parts of the Jordan River are about 50 feet wide
[3824.00 --> 3826.00]  But only about 8 inches deep
[3827.00 --> 3830.00]  The vast majority of it is about 15 feet wide
[3831.00 --> 3832.00]  And maybe 3 or 4 feet deep
[3833.00 --> 3835.00]  And it still floods and fills the banks in the rainy season
[3835.00 --> 3836.00]  And with the snow melt
[3837.00 --> 3839.00]  But the levels that make it to the Jordan River
[3840.00 --> 3843.00]  Are actually really carefully controlled by the Israeli and Jordanian governments
[3844.00 --> 3847.00]  Because it's one of the few sources of fresh water for the people who live there to be able to drink
[3848.00 --> 3849.00]  And so they have to manage it very carefully
[3850.00 --> 3853.00]  But you can't get a sense walking today
[3854.00 --> 3856.00]  What it would have looked like then
[3857.00 --> 3860.00]  But even still, as you approach the Jordan today
[3861.00 --> 3864.00]  Especially if you do it on foot for the Jordan today
[3865.00 --> 3867.00]  From the east, from the Jordanian side
[3868.00 --> 3869.00]  Like we did when we were there
[3870.00 --> 3874.00]  You get a clear sense that there's 3 sort of tiers of banks
[3875.00 --> 3877.00]  That you're walking down these 3 tiers of banks
[3878.00 --> 3880.00]  And in fact there's all sorts of really neat historical records
[3881.00 --> 3884.00]  That talk about that from the 19th century and the 16th century
[3885.00 --> 3887.00]  And even the 1st century Jewish historian named Josephus
[3888.00 --> 3889.00]  Anyway, you don't care about that like I do
[3890.00 --> 3893.00]  Point is, as you're walking down these banks
[3893.00 --> 3899.00]  You get a sense that the Jordan River has been carefully designed and cultivated and prepared
[3900.00 --> 3902.00]  To take on these seasons of its flowing
[3903.00 --> 3904.00]  And so when it's overflowing all the banks
[3905.00 --> 3907.00]  That means it's gone beyond anyone's control
[3908.00 --> 3911.00]  And in fact even today as you walk down those tiers of banks
[3912.00 --> 3914.00]  It sort of feels like you're walking into a jungle
[3914.00 --> 3918.00]  Now after you spent time in the desert
[3919.00 --> 3924.00]  Walking into this really strange jungle is a very surreal feeling
[3925.00 --> 3927.00]  I have some pictures here too, the next one
[3928.00 --> 3930.00]  Right, if you see here, like this is
[3931.00 --> 3934.00]  We've just, as our group, spent a week in the desert
[3935.00 --> 3939.00]  And now we're in this jungle and the humidity is dense and real
[3939.00 --> 3941.00]  And humidity in the desert doesn't actually happen
[3942.00 --> 3944.00]  But because of all the growth that's here
[3945.00 --> 3948.00]  It just feels weird and we're 400 meters below sea level
[3949.00 --> 3950.00]  So that's even more weird
[3951.00 --> 3952.00]  That in the next one you'll see
[3953.00 --> 3955.00]  We're just looking for a place to find shade
[3956.00 --> 3957.00]  Right, it's still 36 degrees out
[3958.00 --> 3960.00]  But we're trying to find a spot
[3960.00 --> 3964.00]  Now imagine 40 years wandering in the desert
[3965.00 --> 3966.00]  Getting water from a rock, right
[3967.00 --> 3968.00]  Relying on God to provide for you for everything
[3969.00 --> 3972.00]  And then you see this river which is overflowing its banks
[3973.00 --> 3977.00]  Probably would have been some 500 feet or so wide at this point
[3978.00 --> 3981.00]  Right, this would look like the Fraser River at the end of May
[3982.00 --> 3986.00]  Right, you know when you're told not to go swimming in the Fraser River
[3986.00 --> 3988.00]  At the end of May
[3989.00 --> 3991.00]  Because the water is just voluminous
[3992.00 --> 3995.00]  The torrent is incredible and it's cold mountain water
[3996.00 --> 3997.00]  That's what this would have looked like
[3998.00 --> 4001.00]  And the people would have seen it and they would remember the Nile in Egypt
[4002.00 --> 4004.00]  Or at least they would have heard stories of the Nile in Egypt
[4005.00 --> 4006.00]  And in Egypt the Nile is life
[4007.00 --> 4008.00]  The river is life
[4009.00 --> 4012.00]  The Nile is the blessing of the gods according to the Egyptians
[4012.00 --> 4016.00]  And here for the first time in a generation
[4017.00 --> 4019.00]  These people see life in the midst of a desert
[4020.00 --> 4025.00]  Now that parallel again, right, is really important
[4026.00 --> 4030.00]  Back to Egypt where they look at the river and they see their gods' protection
[4031.00 --> 4034.00]  Because the same thing would have happened for the people who lived in Jericho
[4035.00 --> 4036.00]  The Canaanites there too
[4036.00 --> 4038.00]  For the Canaanites who lived in Jericho
[4039.00 --> 4043.00]  The river is their gods' protection from attack from the east
[4044.00 --> 4046.00]  Right, Baal is the name of their god
[4047.00 --> 4049.00]  Rahab told the spies a few days earlier
[4050.00 --> 4052.00]  A great fear of you has fallen on us
[4053.00 --> 4055.00]  So that all who live in this country are melting with fear
[4055.00 --> 4062.00]  The people of Jericho are scared because they have heard and now they see this massive nation on the move
[4063.00 --> 4066.00]  But at the same time, the Jordan is all over all its banks
[4067.00 --> 4070.00]  Baal's protection of them is as strong as it can be right now
[4071.00 --> 4076.00]  Right, they believe that their god's protection was at the highest point that it could possibly be for them
[4077.00 --> 4079.00]  And so see that
[4080.00 --> 4086.00]  Because this story about God doing amazing things isn't just about people trusting God
[4087.00 --> 4091.00]  This story isn't just setting the stage for a war between two people groups
[4092.00 --> 4094.00]  This is a story about God and gods
[4095.00 --> 4100.00]  About the god of the Bible being stronger than the gods of the Canaanites
[4100.00 --> 4103.00]  And so the time comes now
[4104.00 --> 4106.00]  Where they have to step into the river
[4107.00 --> 4112.00]  The priests and the twelve men, one from each tribe, have to step into the river
[4113.00 --> 4116.00]  Now they are representatives of the whole nation
[4117.00 --> 4118.00]  Right, you read that in verse 12
[4119.00 --> 4124.00]  All the people have to figuratively step into the river before God does something
[4125.00 --> 4130.00]  Now this is a different part of the story than in the Sea of Reeds or the Red Sea
[4131.00 --> 4135.00]  Right, in the Red Sea, they waited and they watched God work
[4136.00 --> 4138.00]  They woke up and the sea was ready for them to cross on
[4139.00 --> 4142.00]  Now, God is saying, step into the river
[4143.00 --> 4145.00]  Then I will do something
[4146.00 --> 4148.00]  Now, God is saying, consecrate yourselves
[4149.00 --> 4151.00]  For I'm going to do amazing things
[4151.00 --> 4154.00]  You see, the whole point of that wilderness journey
[4154.00 --> 4155.00]  The whole point of walking in the desert
[4156.00 --> 4157.00]  Was learning to trust God
[4158.00 --> 4160.00]  Learning to really, really hear Him
[4161.00 --> 4162.00]  To hear Him and to obey Him
[4163.00 --> 4164.00]  And to be moved in heart
[4165.00 --> 4167.00]  To have their lives changed because of Him
[4168.00 --> 4169.00]  To really love the Lord with all of their heart
[4170.00 --> 4171.00]  With all of their soul
[4171.00 --> 4172.00]  With all of their strength
[4173.00 --> 4175.00]  So God says, consecrate yourselves
[4176.00 --> 4177.00]  Make yourselves ready
[4177.00 --> 4180.00]  Stand up, stand out, be holy
[4181.00 --> 4183.00]  You are marked with a purpose
[4184.00 --> 4188.00]  And He says the same thing to you boys today
[4189.00 --> 4191.00]  Stand up, stand out
[4192.00 --> 4193.00]  Be holy
[4194.00 --> 4197.00]  You are marked with a purpose
[4198.00 --> 4200.00]  God invites them to work
[4201.00 --> 4203.00]  They need to show that they've learned something
[4203.00 --> 4204.00]  That they will have faith
[4204.00 --> 4206.00]  That when God says, walk
[4207.00 --> 4208.00]  They will walk
[4209.00 --> 4212.00]  A faith that trusts even in the midst of something scary
[4213.00 --> 4215.00]  As stepping into a raging river
[4216.00 --> 4217.00]  And I want to be really clear
[4218.00 --> 4220.00]  This isn't a proof for God
[4221.00 --> 4223.00]  It's a proof for the people
[4224.00 --> 4226.00]  Right, God knows the heart
[4227.00 --> 4228.00]  God knows everything
[4228.00 --> 4229.00]  He sees everything
[4229.00 --> 4231.00]  This moment is a proof for them
[4232.00 --> 4234.00]  To see that they really believe
[4235.00 --> 4236.00]  That they really trust
[4237.00 --> 4239.00]  Will they trust God
[4240.00 --> 4242.00]  And follow Him wherever He leads
[4243.00 --> 4244.00]  Real faith
[4245.00 --> 4247.00]  The kind of faith that your counselors hope will grow in you
[4248.00 --> 4251.00]  The kind of faith that your churches and your parents
[4252.00 --> 4255.00]  And your pastors pray over you and for you
[4255.00 --> 4258.00]  Real faith takes risks
[4258.00 --> 4259.00]  Real faith takes risks
[4261.00 --> 4268.00]  Look, God can and God will do amazing things among us
[4270.00 --> 4272.00]  But there is a river for you to step in
[4273.00 --> 4275.00]  There is a risk for you to take
[4276.00 --> 4279.00]  There is a faith for you to lay hold of
[4279.00 --> 4282.00]  But can I also say that now
[4283.00 --> 4284.00]  Now
[4285.00 --> 4288.00]  3,000 years after this story
[4289.00 --> 4291.00]  Faith looks different
[4292.00 --> 4295.00]  Things are different now than they were for the Israelites
[4296.00 --> 4300.00]  Not just because now we have iPhones that we can carry in our pockets
[4301.00 --> 4304.00]  Not now because, just because instead of looking for water
[4304.00 --> 4305.00]  What you are trying to do is
[4306.00 --> 4310.00]  Get the next opportunity to play Fortnite or Minecraft or whatever it is that you are doing
[4311.00 --> 4312.00]  Faith looks different now
[4313.00 --> 4314.00]  Because of a man
[4315.00 --> 4317.00]  A man
[4318.00 --> 4319.00]  Named Jesus
[4320.00 --> 4323.00]  Tara, if you put the baptism slide up
[4324.00 --> 4326.00]  Centuries after this story
[4327.00 --> 4331.00]  Another Israelite would come to this exact spot likely
[4331.00 --> 4334.00]  And he would cross the river
[4335.00 --> 4337.00]  He would begin a journey in the land
[4338.00 --> 4339.00]  Jesus would come to John the Baptist
[4340.00 --> 4341.00]  And at this spot
[4342.00 --> 4343.00]  Pictured here
[4344.00 --> 4345.00]  He would be baptized
[4346.00 --> 4350.00]  And God would confirm for him and for all to see that this man
[4351.00 --> 4353.00]  Jesus was his son
[4353.00 --> 4357.00]  Jesus was baptized and a voice from heaven spoke
[4358.00 --> 4359.00]  This is my son
[4360.00 --> 4361.00]  Whom I love
[4362.00 --> 4368.00]  And Jesus came up out of that river empowered by God to do some amazing things
[4369.00 --> 4372.00]  He came up out of that river with a mission to serve
[4373.00 --> 4376.00]  Cadets each week when you gather and you say
[4377.00 --> 4378.00]  Cadet what is your motto?
[4379.00 --> 4380.00]  Living for Jesus
[4380.00 --> 4381.00]  For Jesus
[4382.00 --> 4385.00]  Know that you are saying living for Jesus means living like
[4386.00 --> 4387.00]  Jesus
[4388.00 --> 4394.00]  And know that you are called to live like Jesus because Jesus lived for you
[4395.00 --> 4398.00]  And that the same voice that spoke to him in that river
[4399.00 --> 4401.00]  This is my son whom I love now speaks to you
[4402.00 --> 4404.00]  You are my sons
[4405.00 --> 4406.00]  Whom I love
[4406.00 --> 4410.00]  Faith makes you take risks
[4411.00 --> 4414.00]  Faith will make you do some pretty wild things
[4415.00 --> 4419.00]  Some things that may not make sense to any of your friends who don't share your same faith
[4420.00 --> 4427.00]  But be assured faith never calls you to do those things alone
[4428.00 --> 4429.00]  You have each other
[4430.00 --> 4432.00]  You have us, you have the church, you have your family
[4432.00 --> 4434.00]  And so consecrate yourselves
[4435.00 --> 4439.00]  For today the Lord will do amazing things
[4440.00 --> 4441.00]  Consecrate yourselves
[4442.00 --> 4446.00]  Make yourselves ready to step out in faith
[4447.00 --> 4448.00]  Cadets say it with me
[4449.00 --> 4461.00]  A cadet must be reverent, obedient, compassionate, consecrated, trustworthy, pure, grateful, loyal, industrious, and cheerful
[4462.00 --> 4465.00]  A generation of boys who become men that are defined like that
[4465.00 --> 4467.00]  In the church as well as you are
[4468.00 --> 4469.00]  In the church as well as you are
[4470.00 --> 4471.00]  And I can still say that from memory from when I was your age
[4472.00 --> 4475.00]  That's what it means to be set apart for God to do amazing things among you and with you
[4476.00 --> 4488.00]  And can I just say that a generation of boys like you who become men that are reverent, obedient, compassionate, consecrated, trustworthy, pure, grateful, loyal, industrious, and cheerful
[4488.00 --> 4491.00]  A generation of boys who become men that are defined like that
[4491.00 --> 4494.00]  That would change the world
[4495.00 --> 4497.00]  That's what the world is hungry for
[4498.00 --> 4501.00]  He made you
[4502.00 --> 4503.00]  He knows you
[4504.00 --> 4505.00]  He loves you
[4506.00 --> 4508.00]  He sees you and he watches over you
[4509.00 --> 4511.00]  That is amazing
[4511.00 --> 4516.00]  And now he's asking you to step into the river
[4517.00 --> 4518.00]  He has plans for you cadets
[4519.00 --> 4523.00]  And he will do amazing things not only among you but through you and in you
[4524.00 --> 4525.00]  Commit yourselves to Jesus
[4526.00 --> 4527.00]  Follow him
[4527.00 --> 4528.00]  Who knows?
[4528.00 --> 4529.00]  Who knows?
[4529.00 --> 4530.00]  Who knows?
[4530.00 --> 4542.00]  How many of you will turn into scientists or doctors or nurses or long haul truck drivers or caregivers or teachers or artists or musicians or missionaries or maybe even pastors or farmers or whatever it is you can add to that list
[4543.00 --> 4544.00]  Who knows?
[4544.00 --> 4552.00]  How many will come from your cadre from your group here gathered who will give glory to God in all that you do?
[4552.00 --> 4554.00]  That changes the world
[4555.00 --> 4561.00]  God is in the business of doing amazing things and you are one of them
[4562.00 --> 4563.00]  Amen?
[4564.00 --> 4565.00]  Let's pray together
[4568.00 --> 4576.00]  Lord our God we pray that today you would make yourself known in power to these cadets
[4576.00 --> 4577.00]  Jesus
[4577.00 --> 4583.00]  Make yourself known in power to these boys that they might grow in the knowledge and faith of you Lord Jesus
[4583.00 --> 4590.00]  That they might grow into the men that you are transforming them to be
[4590.00 --> 4609.00]  We pray God that as you use the cadet program as you use mentors and parents as you use friends as you use anyone to come alongside and transform us into the image of Jesus Christ that we would be willing servants
[4609.00 --> 4616.00]  May we step into the river today
[4616.00 --> 4623.00]  And may we with open eyes see how amazing you are
[4624.00 --> 4625.00]  In Jesus name we pray
[4626.00 --> 4627.00]  Amen
[4627.00 --> 4638.00]  We are going to respond to that message with the song living for Jesus this song of course has been sung by cadets
[4639.00 --> 4640.00]  From time immemorial
[4641.00 --> 4645.00]  Or at least as long as cadets has been around I think and so we're going to do it a little bit differently today
[4645.00 --> 4655.00]  I'm actually going to invite the cadets from all of the churches that are here if you could please stand up and I'm going to invite you you're going to come and make a bit of a group right here
[4656.00 --> 4661.00]  And lead us in that but it won't be just you so you can come right now and do that please if you don't mind
[4662.00 --> 4674.00]  So all of the cadets who are here and the leaders who are in cadets right at this moment come up here stand here and face out and they're going to lead us in the first verse and chorus of this song now they're not going to do it alone
[4675.00 --> 4686.00]  I'm also going to ask as they come up here right now if you have been in cadets or have led cadets at any point throughout your lifetime
[4687.00 --> 4691.00]  If you could also please right now just stand up in your seats is totally fine
[4692.00 --> 4698.00]  And you are going to join these cadets up front in leading verse 1 and the first chorus of that song
[4698.00 --> 4706.00]  After verse 1 and the first chorus I'm going to invite the rest of you to rise and we will sing the rest of the song together
[4707.00 --> 4715.00]  Now there's one more thing we are going to do this acapella which is often done in cadets so we're going to hear the first note and then sing from there
[4715.00 --> 4723.00]  And if you are watching online I'm sorry this might not sound that cool to you because there's not going to be a lot of microphones happening
[4723.00 --> 4726.00]  So just bear with us if you're watching online right now
[4726.00 --> 4733.00]  So Megan's going to give us the first note and we are going to the cadets are going to lead us through the first verse and song here right now
[4733.00 --> 4735.00]  So Megan's singing
[4735.00 --> 4741.00]  Living for Jesus a life at his room
[4742.00 --> 4748.00]  Striving to please him in all that I do
[4749.00 --> 4755.00]  Heal me, O legions, I hearted and free
[4755.00 --> 4761.00]  This is the pathway of blessing for me
[4762.00 --> 4765.00]  O Jesus Lord and Savior
[4766.00 --> 4768.00]  I give myself to thee
[4769.00 --> 4772.00]  For you bring thy atonement
[4773.00 --> 4775.00]  Did give myself for me
[4776.00 --> 4778.00]  I own no other master
[4779.00 --> 4781.00]  I give now thee the throne
[4781.00 --> 4785.00]  My life I give henceforth to live
[4786.00 --> 4790.00]  O Christ for thee alone
[4791.00 --> 4792.00]  Please rise
[4793.00 --> 4796.00]  Living for Jesus
[4797.00 --> 4800.00]  He died in my place
[4801.00 --> 4805.00]  Bearing on Calvary my sin and disgrace
[4805.00 --> 4807.00]  Such love constraints me
[4808.00 --> 4811.00]  Such love constraints me
[4812.00 --> 4814.00]  To answer his call
[4815.00 --> 4817.00]  Follow his leading
[4818.00 --> 4821.00]  And give him my all
[4822.00 --> 4825.00]  O Jesus Lord and Savior
[4826.00 --> 4828.00]  I give myself to thee
[4828.00 --> 4830.00]  For thou in thy atonement
[4830.00 --> 4832.00]  For thou in thy atonement
[4833.00 --> 4835.00]  Did give myself for thee
[4836.00 --> 4839.00]  I own no other master
[4840.00 --> 4842.00]  My heart shall be thy throne
[4843.00 --> 4847.00]  My life I give henceforth to live
[4848.00 --> 4850.00]  O Christ for thee alone
[4850.00 --> 4852.00]  Living for Jesus

[4853.00 --> 4854.00]  Wherever I am
[4854.00 --> 4855.00]  Living for Jesus
[4855.00 --> 4856.00]  Wherever I am
[4857.00 --> 4861.00]  To we need to be in His holy name
[4861.00 --> 4870.00]  Willing to suffer
[4870.00 --> 4874.00]  Suffer, affliction or loss
[4875.00 --> 4877.00]  Beating each trial
[4878.00 --> 4881.00]  A part of my cross
[4882.00 --> 4885.00]  O Jesus Lord and Savior
[4886.00 --> 4888.00]  I give myself to thee
[4889.00 --> 4892.00]  For thou in thy atonement
[4893.00 --> 4895.00]  Did give thyself for me
[4895.00 --> 4896.00]  I own no other master
[4896.00 --> 4897.00]  I own no other master
[4898.00 --> 4900.00]  My heart shall be thy throne
[4901.00 --> 4905.00]  My life I give henceforth to live
[4906.00 --> 4910.00]  O Christ for thee alone
[4911.00 --> 4912.00]  Living for Jesus
[4913.00 --> 4916.00]  Through earth in a while
[4916.00 --> 4917.00]  My dearest treasure
[4917.00 --> 4927.00]  The light of His smile
[4928.00 --> 4931.00]  Seeing the lost one
[4932.00 --> 4934.00]  He died to redeem
[4935.00 --> 4937.00]  Bringing the weary
[4938.00 --> 4941.00]  To find rest in Him
[4942.00 --> 4945.00]  O Jesus Lord and Savior
[4945.00 --> 4948.00]  I give myself to thee
[4949.00 --> 4952.00]  For thou in thy atonement
[4953.00 --> 4955.00]  Did give thyself for me
[4956.00 --> 4959.00]  I own no other master
[4960.00 --> 4962.00]  My heart shall be thy throne
[4963.00 --> 4967.00]  My life I give henceforth to live
[4968.00 --> 4972.00]  O Christ for thee alone
[4972.00 --> 4975.00]  Thank you cadets
[4975.00 --> 4976.00]  You can make your way back to their seats
[4977.00 --> 4979.00]  But everybody can still remain standing please
[4980.00 --> 4984.00]  As the cadets make their way back to the seats
[4985.00 --> 4989.00]  I just want to invite you to stick around following our worship
[4990.00 --> 4992.00]  There's going to be some coffee and fellowship in the back
[4992.00 --> 4999.00]  You can check out the table from Emanuel's cadet program where they have some of the crafts and projects that they've worked on
[4999.00 --> 5001.00]  Or you can talk to some of these boys here
[5002.00 --> 5008.00]  For you cadets who have come there is a lunch that's happening afterwards and that's going to happen in here
[5009.00 --> 5016.00]  So at some point not immediately but at some point we're also going to start clearing chairs out of here so we can pull tables out
[5016.00 --> 5027.00]  And so if you are a member here and able to help clear some chairs that would be a big help to hear and getting some tables from the back hall and bringing them down that would be good for them as well
[5028.00 --> 5037.00]  Following our worship we have a prayer partner who is available and today that prayer partner is going to be available here at the front just off to the side
[5037.00 --> 5042.00]  And so if you would like to pray with someone there will be someone up front here with a yellow name tag like mine
[5043.00 --> 5048.00]  They will pray with you for you and over you as you go today
[5049.00 --> 5052.00]  As we go then go knowing that God goes with us
[5053.00 --> 5060.00]  That God has amazing things in store and he gives us his blessing for the journey of life and faith
[5061.00 --> 5064.00]  And so receive the blessing of our God
[5067.00 --> 5069.00]  The Lord bless you
[5069.00 --> 5070.00]  And keep you
[5071.00 --> 5074.00]  The Lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you
[5075.00 --> 5080.00]  The Lord turn his face towards you and give you his peace
