[0.00 --> 2.00]  Oh, a flat, yes.
[3.00 --> 7.00]  That's what it's supposed to be. I totally missed that because I didn't say it.
[7.00 --> 9.00]  That's what I thought it was?
[9.00 --> 11.00]  Yeah, you're absolutely right. That's what it's supposed to be.
[13.00 --> 15.00]  Why do you say that? I don't.
[15.00 --> 16.00]  I do.
[30.00 --> 32.00]  I do.
[60.00 --> 62.00]  I do.
[90.00 --> 104.00]  I do.
[104.00 --> 106.00]  I do.
[106.00 --> 135.98]  Thank you.
[136.00 --> 165.98]  Thank you.
[166.00 --> 195.98]  Thank you.
[196.00 --> 225.98]  Thank you.
[226.00 --> 255.98]  Thank you.
[256.00 --> 258.00]  Thank you.
[286.00 --> 288.00]  Thank you.
[316.00 --> 318.00]  Thank you.
[346.00 --> 348.00]  Thank you.
[348.00 --> 350.00]  Thank you.
[350.00 --> 352.00]  Thank you.
[352.00 --> 354.00]  Thank you.
[354.00 --> 356.00]  Thank you.
[384.00 --> 386.00]  Thank you.
[386.00 --> 388.00]  Thank you.
[416.00 --> 418.00]  Thank you.
[446.00 --> 448.00]  Thank you.
[448.00 --> 450.00]  Thank you.
[450.00 --> 452.00]  Thank you.
[452.00 --> 454.00]  Thank you.
[482.00 --> 484.00]  Thank you.
[484.00 --> 486.00]  Thank you.
[486.00 --> 488.00]  Thank you.
[488.00 --> 490.00]  Thank you.
[490.00 --> 492.00]  God,
[492.00 --> 494.00]  God,
[494.00 --> 496.00]  God.
[496.00 --> 498.00]  God,
[498.00 --> 500.00]  I have
[500.00 --> 505.66]  surrender
[505.66 --> 514.34]  May this offering stretch across the sky
[514.34 --> 518.38]  Peace, hallelujah
[518.38 --> 530.06]  Good, good, good morning everyone
[530.06 --> 536.14]  That video you just saw was a video of Cascade Family Bible Camp
[536.14 --> 539.86]  Which is a camp that's held down in Washington, D.C.
[539.90 --> 542.44]  About an hour north, right, of Seattle-ish
[542.44 --> 547.92]  Anyways, Aaron's like in charge of that camp basically
[547.92 --> 549.06]  So I'm going to pass him the microphone
[549.06 --> 550.66]  He's going to explain it to you better than I will
[550.66 --> 553.18]  Okay, good morning
[553.18 --> 555.08]  Is it working? Okay, okay
[555.08 --> 558.22]  Yeah, Cascade Family Bible Camp
[558.22 --> 561.96]  It's a camp that was put on by the Christian Reformed Church
[561.96 --> 563.62]  About 50 years now
[563.62 --> 566.02]  And it's pretty awesome
[566.02 --> 568.64]  So you have, there's a speaker
[568.64 --> 571.32]  There's programs for kids
[571.32 --> 572.52]  I like to call it
[572.52 --> 576.32]  Like Vacation Bible School on steroids
[576.32 --> 577.42]  So you have
[577.42 --> 579.88]  You have preschool age
[579.88 --> 581.90]  There's programs for preschool age
[581.90 --> 583.56]  There's programs for middle school
[583.56 --> 586.14]  High school, elementary, and then adults
[586.14 --> 588.40]  And there's games
[588.40 --> 589.88]  There's rocket launching
[589.88 --> 590.98]  There's rocket building
[590.98 --> 593.74]  There's anything you could possibly think of
[593.74 --> 596.02]  It's on July this year
[596.02 --> 598.68]  Kevin will be the youth leader this year
[598.68 --> 601.72]  And so from July
[601.72 --> 603.86]  It's July 6 through 10
[603.86 --> 604.60]  I think
[604.60 --> 605.54]  7 through 10
[605.54 --> 609.18]  Love to see more people here
[609.18 --> 609.78]  When I was
[609.78 --> 611.50]  I've been going to the camp for 30 years
[611.50 --> 614.36]  And I started when I was like 12 years old
[614.36 --> 615.24]  Or something like that
[615.24 --> 617.94]  And there used to be a lot of Canadians
[617.94 --> 618.72]  That showed up
[618.72 --> 619.48]  A lot
[619.48 --> 621.80]  And now there's not so many Canadians
[621.80 --> 622.36]  That showed up
[622.36 --> 623.76]  And I love it
[623.76 --> 625.66]  Ken went a couple years ago
[625.66 --> 626.98]  Actually it's probably been
[626.98 --> 628.76]  A long time ago actually
[628.76 --> 629.26]  10 years
[629.26 --> 630.96]  And so I
[630.96 --> 632.30]  If you have any questions
[632.30 --> 633.40]  Come talk to me
[633.40 --> 634.92]  I'd love to
[634.92 --> 637.40]  Tell you a little bit more about it
[637.40 --> 638.52]  It'd be cool to get
[638.52 --> 640.30]  A bunch of people from church to come
[640.30 --> 641.50]  And
[641.50 --> 642.46]  It's a lot of fun
[642.46 --> 643.60]  My kids actually
[643.60 --> 644.80]  One year
[644.80 --> 647.06]  My wife and kids were going to leave
[647.06 --> 648.42]  And go to the Netherlands
[648.42 --> 650.88]  And they wanted to stay at camp longer
[650.88 --> 651.66]  And go
[651.66 --> 652.70]  Move their ticket
[652.70 --> 653.26]  So they could
[653.26 --> 654.70]  Spend less time in the Netherlands
[654.70 --> 655.76]  To stay at camp longer
[655.76 --> 656.18]  So
[656.18 --> 658.10]  I said that's not possible
[658.10 --> 658.44]  So
[658.44 --> 658.92]  Yeah
[658.92 --> 660.92]  And I believe
[660.92 --> 661.58]  For Canadians
[661.58 --> 662.70]  If it's first time going
[662.70 --> 663.52]  There's a promo code
[663.52 --> 664.10]  When you register
[664.10 --> 664.76]  You save like
[664.76 --> 665.92]  25%
[665.92 --> 667.04]  If you're the first time goer
[667.04 --> 668.14]  If you're Canadian
[668.14 --> 669.76]  And a first time goer
[669.76 --> 670.38]  It's like
[670.38 --> 671.86]  45%
[671.86 --> 672.64]  Or 40%
[672.64 --> 673.46]  So it's a good year
[673.46 --> 674.14]  To sign up
[674.14 --> 674.94]  Like you said Aaron
[674.94 --> 675.68]  We'll hopefully camp
[675.68 --> 676.66]  In a clump together too
[676.66 --> 676.94]  So
[676.94 --> 678.16]  Let us know
[678.16 --> 679.16]  If you're planning on coming
[679.16 --> 680.38]  We'll group together
[680.38 --> 681.02]  It'll be very fun
[681.02 --> 681.92]  So
[681.92 --> 682.60]  There you go
[682.60 --> 684.94]  That one can stay there
[684.94 --> 689.52]  Alright
[689.52 --> 690.74]  I also want to say
[690.74 --> 691.22]  Good morning
[691.22 --> 694.32]  Yeah
[694.32 --> 695.16]  We'll let that slide
[695.16 --> 695.62]  This morning
[695.62 --> 696.38]  That's alright
[696.38 --> 697.76]  Welcome to worship
[697.76 --> 698.72]  If you are here
[698.72 --> 699.62]  Visiting with us
[699.62 --> 701.16]  Or if you're still filing in
[701.16 --> 702.20]  We're really excited
[702.20 --> 703.80]  That you are here
[703.80 --> 704.56]  My name is Chris
[704.56 --> 706.34]  I'm one of the pastors here
[706.34 --> 707.84]  And it's my privilege
[707.84 --> 709.08]  Along with these others
[709.08 --> 710.06]  To lead us
[710.06 --> 711.58]  In our shared worship together
[711.58 --> 713.14]  Later on in our service
[713.14 --> 713.84]  As you see
[713.84 --> 714.52]  We're going to come
[714.52 --> 715.52]  To the Lord's table
[715.52 --> 716.32]  And so you can
[716.32 --> 717.40]  Throughout
[717.40 --> 718.96]  Be preparing your heart
[718.96 --> 719.70]  For that
[719.70 --> 722.54]  And as we come later
[722.54 --> 723.38]  We will give some more
[723.38 --> 724.60]  Instructions on that
[724.60 --> 725.68]  Before we begin
[725.68 --> 726.42]  There are a couple
[726.42 --> 727.58]  Other announcements
[727.58 --> 728.24]  To make
[728.24 --> 728.84]  And so I'm going to
[728.84 --> 729.44]  Invite Wendy
[729.44 --> 730.42]  To come up to the front
[730.42 --> 731.26]  And Josh
[731.26 --> 733.16]  And grab the microphone there
[733.16 --> 734.00]  And you go ahead
[734.00 --> 735.32]  And make your announcements
[735.32 --> 740.86]  Hello
[740.86 --> 741.46]  Okay
[741.46 --> 743.70]  So the Young Adults Bible Study
[743.70 --> 744.16]  Is today
[744.16 --> 745.52]  One hour after church
[745.52 --> 747.68]  At Courtney Rorsma's house
[747.68 --> 750.12]  She is happily hosting us
[750.12 --> 751.60]  And providing a wonderful lunch
[751.60 --> 753.50]  Also she has an exquisite
[753.50 --> 754.56]  Assortment of tea
[754.56 --> 756.60]  So if the Lord is not
[756.60 --> 757.84]  What brings you to the Bible study
[757.84 --> 759.56]  The tea collection will
[759.56 --> 760.60]  So you should go
[760.60 --> 762.00]  Also we're talking
[762.00 --> 762.72]  About the Lord's Supper
[762.72 --> 763.66]  Ironically enough
[763.66 --> 765.46]  Sovereignty of God
[765.46 --> 766.18]  Plans those things
[766.18 --> 766.70]  Not me
[766.70 --> 768.22]  That was completely unintended
[768.22 --> 768.98]  So
[768.98 --> 770.22]  Young Adults
[770.22 --> 770.96]  You should go
[770.96 --> 771.96]  Awesome
[771.96 --> 778.56]  Good morning
[778.56 --> 780.24]  I'm Wendy Fulkerts
[780.24 --> 781.48]  On behalf of
[781.48 --> 782.74]  Women's Fellowship Group
[782.74 --> 783.32]  Which is
[783.32 --> 785.30]  Linda Molenkamp
[785.30 --> 787.16]  And Fran Skipper
[787.16 --> 788.50]  We're just inviting
[788.50 --> 790.22]  All women to come out
[790.22 --> 791.26]  On June 20th
[791.26 --> 792.66]  It's a Tuesday evening
[792.66 --> 795.54]  We have it in the bulletin
[795.54 --> 796.98]  But we've changed the venue
[796.98 --> 798.64]  To our church courtyard
[798.64 --> 800.92]  Just because of
[800.92 --> 803.14]  Sometimes it's quite noisy
[803.14 --> 803.76]  At the park
[803.76 --> 804.08]  So
[804.08 --> 805.98]  And it's
[805.98 --> 807.16]  Kind of a wedding
[807.16 --> 808.48]  Blessing
[808.48 --> 808.94]  It's not
[808.94 --> 810.86]  It's a wedding blessing
[810.86 --> 812.38]  For two girls
[812.38 --> 812.82]  That
[812.82 --> 815.26]  We'd like to welcome
[815.26 --> 816.10]  Into our church
[816.10 --> 817.24]  It's
[817.24 --> 818.80]  For Jane
[818.80 --> 819.58]  Who's marrying
[819.58 --> 821.40]  Micah Klosterhoff
[821.40 --> 822.32]  And also for Kristen
[822.32 --> 822.94]  Who's marrying
[822.94 --> 823.84]  Jared Berndt
[823.84 --> 826.12]  And I don't even know
[826.12 --> 826.76]  Those women
[826.76 --> 828.06]  That well either
[828.06 --> 828.42]  But
[828.42 --> 830.58]  We just promised
[830.58 --> 831.22]  That we would
[831.22 --> 832.38]  Welcome
[832.38 --> 833.48]  New
[833.48 --> 835.46]  Members
[835.46 --> 836.28]  Into our church
[836.28 --> 837.30]  And especially
[837.30 --> 839.26]  For those two girls
[839.26 --> 840.00]  We'd like to
[840.00 --> 840.84]  Invite them
[840.84 --> 841.20]  To
[841.20 --> 843.16]  This shower
[843.16 --> 843.68]  And
[843.68 --> 844.74]  We're just
[844.74 --> 845.60]  Really encouraging
[845.60 --> 846.12]  All of you
[846.12 --> 846.74]  To come out
[846.74 --> 847.40]  And welcome
[847.40 --> 847.70]  Them
[847.70 --> 848.96]  Into our family
[848.96 --> 849.70]  And we'll just
[849.70 --> 851.00]  It's very casual
[851.00 --> 851.60]  It's
[851.60 --> 853.64]  Not even going to be
[853.64 --> 854.44]  Games there
[854.44 --> 854.72]  So
[854.72 --> 856.40]  If you don't like
[856.40 --> 857.10]  Shower games
[857.10 --> 858.06]  But it's
[858.06 --> 858.92]  We're basically
[858.92 --> 859.72]  Getting to know
[859.72 --> 860.90]  These two girls
[860.90 --> 862.10]  And their families
[862.10 --> 862.76]  Okay
[862.76 --> 863.32]  Thanks
[863.32 --> 868.74]  And then
[868.74 --> 869.68]  One last thing
[869.68 --> 870.58]  We are
[870.58 --> 871.18]  Continuing
[871.18 --> 871.62]  With
[871.62 --> 872.18]  Pastors
[872.18 --> 872.66]  Class
[872.66 --> 873.16]  After
[873.16 --> 873.88]  Our
[873.88 --> 874.24]  Worship
[874.24 --> 874.56]  Today
[874.56 --> 874.90]  And so
[874.90 --> 875.36]  For those of you
[875.36 --> 875.66]  Who have been
[875.66 --> 876.94]  Participating in that
[876.94 --> 878.54]  We'll be in the
[878.54 --> 879.60]  Multipurpose room again
[879.60 --> 881.48]  About 15 or 20 minutes
[881.48 --> 882.52]  At the end
[882.52 --> 883.72]  After the end
[883.72 --> 884.56]  Of our worship
[884.56 --> 884.94]  Together
[884.94 --> 889.24]  There's a youth
[889.24 --> 890.22]  Barbecue today
[890.22 --> 892.12]  From 5 to 8
[892.12 --> 892.76]  At the
[892.76 --> 893.50]  Van Hemerts
[893.50 --> 893.96]  Van Hemerts
[893.96 --> 894.50]  Raise your hand
[894.50 --> 895.80]  If you don't know
[895.80 --> 896.30]  Where that is
[896.30 --> 896.94]  Talk to them
[896.94 --> 897.92]  It's like
[897.92 --> 898.66]  Half a block
[898.66 --> 899.28]  Away from here
[899.28 --> 899.98]  Nice and close
[899.98 --> 901.14]  And so
[901.14 --> 901.76]  That's end of the year
[901.76 --> 902.78]  Celebration for youth
[902.78 --> 903.46]  If you have questions
[903.46 --> 904.22]  You can get Kevin
[904.22 --> 905.46]  Or the Van Hemerts
[905.46 --> 906.88]  Perfect
[906.88 --> 908.32]  Let's stand together
[908.32 --> 909.80]  As we gather
[909.80 --> 910.82]  In God's presence
[910.82 --> 914.82]  We are here
[914.82 --> 915.58]  In the presence
[915.58 --> 916.04]  Of God
[916.04 --> 917.32]  And we mark that
[917.32 --> 918.62]  We acknowledge that
[918.62 --> 919.70]  By receiving
[919.70 --> 921.22]  His greeting
[921.22 --> 922.58]  Following the greeting
[922.58 --> 923.08]  Of God
[923.08 --> 923.72]  I'm going to invite you
[923.72 --> 924.54]  To turn to those
[924.54 --> 925.14]  Around you
[925.14 --> 926.14]  And welcome them
[926.14 --> 927.64]  Into worship
[927.64 --> 929.20]  Receive the greeting
[929.20 --> 929.98]  Of our Lord
[929.98 --> 931.34]  Grace

[941.56 --> 943.30]  Amen
[943.30 --> 944.88]  Welcome
[944.88 --> 947.90]  Good morning

[969.08 --> 982.04]  Our call to worship this morning comes from Ezra 3.
[983.42 --> 990.24]  When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the Lord,
[990.82 --> 994.88]  the priests, in their vestments and with trumpets,
[995.24 --> 998.12]  and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with cymbals,
[998.12 --> 1004.16]  took their places to praise the Lord, as prescribed by David, king of Israel.
[1004.84 --> 1007.94]  With praise and thanksgiving they sang to the Lord,
[1008.34 --> 1012.42]  He is good, his love toward Israel endures forever.
[1012.96 --> 1016.42]  And all the people gave a great shout of praise to the Lord,
[1016.74 --> 1020.18]  because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid.
[1028.12 --> 1044.64]  Holy, holy, holy,

[1720.62 --> 1734.02]  Please pray with me.
[1735.24 --> 1739.80]  In Jeremiah 6, Lord, you tell us to stand at the crossroads and look.
[1740.62 --> 1743.28]  To ask where the good way is and walk in it.
[1744.08 --> 1747.10]  Only here will we find rest for our souls.
[1748.36 --> 1750.52]  But we confess that we do not walk in it.
[1750.66 --> 1752.10]  We refuse to listen.
[1752.10 --> 1758.84]  Because we have not listened to your words and have rejected your law, you bring disaster.
[1760.24 --> 1763.92]  Lord, we pray that you would open our eyes to our sinful ways.
[1764.30 --> 1766.80]  Bring restoration to this world and to your people.
[1767.30 --> 1770.66]  Forgive us when we do not listen and walk in your ways.
[1771.40 --> 1777.84]  Lord of peace, renew a steadfast spirit within us so that we can rest in you alone.
[1778.64 --> 1778.96]  Amen.
[1778.96 --> 1779.10]  Amen.
[1780.62 --> 1792.32]  The Queen ofance

[1801.82 --> 1807.32]  No winds of change will rage tomorrow
[1807.32 --> 1813.48]  God is at your side
[1813.48 --> 1816.16]  No longer dread
[1816.16 --> 1821.94]  The fires of unexpected sorrow
[1821.94 --> 1827.72]  God, you are my God
[1827.72 --> 1830.74]  And I will trust in you
[1830.74 --> 1834.78]  And I'll be shaken
[1834.78 --> 1841.20]  All of these relief
[1841.20 --> 1845.74]  And so fast we're under the need
[1845.74 --> 1851.90]  To rest in you alone
[1851.90 --> 1863.10]  Still, my soul, be still
[1863.10 --> 1865.96]  Do not be moved
[1865.96 --> 1870.92]  By lesser lights and fleeting shadows
[1870.92 --> 1876.96]  Hold on to the end
[1876.96 --> 1880.96]  With shield of aid
[1880.96 --> 1885.74]  Against temptations when he airs
[1885.74 --> 1891.44]  God, you are my Lord
[1891.44 --> 1894.52]  And I will trust in you
[1894.52 --> 1895.02]  And I will trust in you
[1895.02 --> 1898.02]  And I will trust in you
[1898.02 --> 1903.02]  And I will trust in you
[1903.02 --> 1905.02]  Lord, you are my God
[1905.02 --> 1907.02]  And I will trust in you
[1907.02 --> 1913.02]  And I will trust in you
[1913.02 --> 1917.02]  To rest in you alone
[1917.02 --> 1927.40]  Still, my soul, be still
[1927.40 --> 1930.02]  Do not forsake
[1930.02 --> 1935.02]  The truth you learned in the beginning
[1935.02 --> 1941.02]  Wait upon the Lord
[1941.02 --> 1946.02]  And hope will rise
[1946.02 --> 1947.02]  As stars appear

[1960.02 --> 1962.02]  And I will trust in you
[1962.02 --> 1992.00]  Thank you.
[1992.02 --> 2006.10]  Oh, please leave us that the Spirit within me to ask in you.
[2006.10 --> 2013.10]  Thank you.
[2013.10 --> 2015.42]  Please stand with me.
[2015.42 --> 2022.16]  As we recite together Lord's Day question and answer 52 as our assurance this morning.
[2022.16 --> 2024.16]  Question.
[2024.16 --> 2031.16]  How does Christ's return to judge the living and the dead comfort you?
[2031.16 --> 2048.88]  In all distress and persecution, with uplifted head, I confidently await the very Judge who has already offered himself to the judgment of God in my place and removed the whole curse from me.
[2048.88 --> 2063.46]  Christ will cast all his enemies and mine into everlasting confirmation, but will take me and all the chosen ones to himself into the joy and glory of heaven.
[2063.46 --> 2093.44]  Thank you.
[2093.44 --> 2095.44]  Thank you.

[2159.92 --> 2161.92]  Far be it from me to not believe.
[2161.92 --> 2165.92]  Even when my eyes can't see.
[2165.92 --> 2171.92]  And this mountain that's in the high of me.
[2171.92 --> 2177.92]  Will be thrown into the cliffs of the sea.
[2177.92 --> 2181.92]  Through and home, through and home.
[2181.92 --> 2185.92]  My eyes are under.
[2185.92 --> 2189.92]  Through and home, through and home.

[2209.92 --> 2213.92]  And trust in Him.
[2213.92 --> 2219.92]  The ways and ways still go His way.

[2223.92 --> 2225.92]  And trust in Him.
[2225.92 --> 2229.92]  The ways and ways still go His way.
[2229.92 --> 2233.92]  Still go His way.
[2233.92 --> 2237.92]  To let go, my soul.
[2237.92 --> 2239.92]  And trust in Him.
[2239.92 --> 2243.92]  The ways and ways still go His way.
[2243.92 --> 2245.92]  Still go His way.
[2245.92 --> 2247.92]  Still go His way.
[2247.92 --> 2249.92]  The ways and ways still go His way.

[2251.92 --> 2253.92]  Still go His way.
[2253.92 --> 2255.92]  It is well.

[2283.92 --> 2295.92]  With my soul.
[2295.92 --> 2297.92]  It is well.
[2297.92 --> 2299.92]  It is well.
[2299.92 --> 2301.92]  It is well.
[2301.92 --> 2302.92]  It is well.

[2445.64 --> 2461.64]  Thank you.
[2461.64 --> 2466.64]  Good morning.
[2466.64 --> 2471.64]  My name is Clem, and I am one of the deacons here at Emmanuel.
[2471.64 --> 2475.64]  The first offering is for the ministries and missions of our church.
[2475.64 --> 2479.64]  The special offering is for Open Doors Canada.
[2479.64 --> 2488.64]  This organization supports and strengthens persecuted Christians around the world in more than 70 countries.
[2488.64 --> 2491.64]  They distribute about 1 million Bibles per year.
[2491.64 --> 2500.64]  They also train persecuted Christians with survival seminars, trauma care, leadership, and discipleship courses.
[2500.64 --> 2510.64]  In 2020, they helped almost a million people with emergency relief, community development, education, and medical care.
[2510.64 --> 2527.64]  Now, quoting the founder of Open Doors, Brother Andrew, our prayers go nowhere, go, sorry, our prayers go where we cannot, which refers to places like North Korea and the like.
[2527.64 --> 2535.64]  In Romans 8, 35, 37, who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
[2535.64 --> 2540.64]  As it is written, for your sake we face death all day long.
[2540.64 --> 2543.64]  We are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.
[2543.64 --> 2549.64]  No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.
[2549.64 --> 2552.64]  Give according to your blessings.
[2552.64 --> 2554.64]  Thank you.
[2557.64 --> 2559.64]  Thank you.
[2587.64 --> 2589.64]  Thank you.
[2617.64 --> 2619.64]  Thank you.
[2647.64 --> 2649.64]  Thank you.
[2677.64 --> 2679.52]  Thank you.
[2680.64 --> 2683.44]  Thank you.
[2707.64 --> 2737.62]  Thank you.
[2737.64 --> 2767.62]  Thank you.
[2767.64 --> 2772.94]  All the three-year-olds up to grade four to come up for a WeChat and then the children's
[2772.94 --> 2773.38]  blessing.
[2781.90 --> 2782.30]  Hello.
[2782.62 --> 2783.28]  How are you all?
[2784.20 --> 2784.60]  Good.
[2784.92 --> 2785.28]  Good.
[2785.70 --> 2786.78]  Hey, do you guys know?
[2786.96 --> 2787.54]  Do you guys remember?
[2787.58 --> 2788.00]  Well, you know.
[2788.16 --> 2788.84]  I know you know.
[2789.44 --> 2792.64]  Do you guys remember what we've been talking about in children's worship time?
[2792.64 --> 2795.22]  What's the theme?
[2796.30 --> 2797.36]  Fruits of the Spirit.
[2797.54 --> 2799.20]  Isla is on top of it.
[2799.94 --> 2804.44]  So as I'm sitting here, I'm just going to start pulling out some actual fruits.
[2805.80 --> 2806.28]  Yeah.
[2806.28 --> 2808.76]  I'm wondering, do you guys know?
[2808.90 --> 2812.58]  Can you guys tell us what are the fruits of the Spirit?
[2812.62 --> 2813.92]  We haven't done them all yet.
[2814.60 --> 2816.14]  But I'm amazed at what you guys know.
[2816.92 --> 2818.30]  Names, just call them out.
[2819.02 --> 2819.46]  Love.
[2820.12 --> 2820.52]  Joy.
[2821.24 --> 2821.66]  Peace.
[2822.06 --> 2822.54]  Patience.
[2823.14 --> 2823.66]  Kindness.
[2823.66 --> 2828.02]  Yeah, for sure.
[2828.24 --> 2829.52]  I'm sure we mixed a few extras.
[2829.66 --> 2830.72]  Nice job, guys.
[2832.26 --> 2834.22]  We haven't even got through all nine yet.
[2834.32 --> 2836.68]  We are on, we're on the fifth one.
[2836.76 --> 2837.66]  Not that they're ordered.
[2837.82 --> 2839.78]  But we're the fifth one that's listed in Galatians.
[2839.86 --> 2842.24]  So last week, do you guys remember which one we talked about?
[2843.76 --> 2844.16]  Patience.
[2844.56 --> 2845.66]  It was patience last week.
[2845.66 --> 2849.98]  And this week, we're going to talk about the next one on the list.
[2849.98 --> 2858.46]  But if you guys had to pick a fruit that you would say is like one of the fruits of the Spirit,
[2858.64 --> 2859.94]  what would you pick?
[2860.00 --> 2862.20]  Like if you were to say love, what would you say?
[2862.30 --> 2863.68]  What kind of fruit is love like?
[2865.58 --> 2866.40]  A banana.
[2866.86 --> 2867.22]  Why?
[2867.42 --> 2869.12]  Why is love like a banana?
[2869.94 --> 2870.92]  Because you love them.
[2871.08 --> 2872.28]  You love the taste of bananas?
[2875.62 --> 2876.92]  Because they're really tasty.
[2877.40 --> 2879.64]  What about patience?
[2879.64 --> 2881.90]  What fruit would you say patience is like?
[2883.78 --> 2884.44]  An apple?
[2884.58 --> 2885.08]  Why an apple?
[2887.34 --> 2890.48]  I would say like a pomegranate.
[2890.58 --> 2891.70]  Do you know what a pomegranate is?
[2892.66 --> 2895.12]  It takes a bit of time to get through a pomegranate.
[2895.28 --> 2899.36]  You've got to hit it and you've got to shake all the things out and eat them all little bits at a time.
[2899.94 --> 2902.42]  What about peace?
[2903.20 --> 2905.46]  What fruit would you say is like peace?
[2905.46 --> 2909.12]  I've got some fruits here to look at.
[2909.88 --> 2910.96]  Why strawberries?
[2911.80 --> 2912.44]  Or a peach?
[2913.20 --> 2913.92]  Why a peach?
[2914.64 --> 2915.10]  Don't know.
[2915.42 --> 2916.10]  We just like them.
[2916.54 --> 2916.70]  Yeah.
[2916.82 --> 2918.14]  They're soft on the outside.
[2918.36 --> 2919.46]  Yummy on the inside.
[2919.60 --> 2920.80]  Just like peace, I guess.
[2920.80 --> 2923.60]  So, here's some ideas.
[2925.50 --> 2930.58]  Well, today we're going to talk about the fruit of the spirit of kindness.
[2931.54 --> 2934.52]  Okay, which fruit would you say is like kindness?
[2935.98 --> 2936.94]  Just to be fun.
[2937.60 --> 2938.28]  What would you say?
[2938.40 --> 2939.72]  What fruit reminds you of kindness?
[2939.72 --> 2945.92]  Kind of like a peach as well.
[2945.92 --> 2946.36]  Yeah?
[2946.82 --> 2947.82]  Any other ideas?
[2947.92 --> 2948.74]  I have an idea.
[2952.50 --> 2954.40]  You have so many fruits at home?
[2954.72 --> 2959.16]  Well, I'm going to say kindness is kind of like a watermelon.
[2960.62 --> 2961.18]  Right?
[2962.46 --> 2963.02]  Yeah.
[2963.16 --> 2965.68]  Why do you think I would think kindness is like a watermelon?
[2966.52 --> 2968.06]  It's a pretty big fruit.
[2971.12 --> 2971.66]  Yeah?
[2971.66 --> 2974.84]  Because do you ever just eat a watermelon by yourself?
[2975.74 --> 2976.14]  No?
[2976.54 --> 2977.82]  I had a cousin that did actually.
[2978.04 --> 2979.26]  But, yeah.
[2979.90 --> 2984.12]  Do you think this is the kind of thing you just pull out and you eat for yourself?
[2985.10 --> 2985.54]  No.
[2985.64 --> 2988.28]  It's meant to be shared.
[2988.98 --> 2989.34]  Yeah.
[2989.78 --> 2993.74]  So, I think that's what we're going to talk about today in Children's Worship Time.
[2994.10 --> 2999.04]  It's how kindness is kind of one of the big fruits of the spirit that you just got to share it.
[2999.12 --> 3000.04]  It's for other people.
[3000.56 --> 3000.76]  Okay?
[3000.76 --> 3003.00]  So, we'll talk more in the back in the other room.
[3003.30 --> 3007.74]  But, let's stand together with the church and we will do the blessing.
[3009.18 --> 3010.28]  So, raise our hands.
[3010.42 --> 3010.62]  Ready?
[3011.82 --> 3012.26]  I do.
[3012.38 --> 3012.72]  Let's turn.
[3012.92 --> 3015.86]  The Lord be with you.
[3016.42 --> 3017.66]  Also with you.
[3017.66 --> 3018.16]  Amen.
[3018.16 --> 3018.66]  Amen.
[3018.66 --> 3019.66]  Amen.
[3019.66 --> 3019.72]  Amen.
[3019.72 --> 3019.82]  Amen.
[3019.82 --> 3019.86]  Amen.
[3019.86 --> 3020.16]  Amen.
[3020.16 --> 3020.22]  Amen.
[3020.22 --> 3020.76]  Amen.
[3020.76 --> 3020.82]  Amen.
[3020.82 --> 3020.86]  Amen.
[3020.86 --> 3020.90]  Amen.
[3020.90 --> 3021.82]  Amen.
[3021.82 --> 3021.90]  Amen.
[3021.90 --> 3022.90]  Amen.
[3022.90 --> 3022.98]  Amen.
[3022.98 --> 3023.90]  Amen.
[3023.90 --> 3024.90]  Amen.
[3024.90 --> 3025.90]  Amen.
[3025.90 --> 3026.90]  Amen.
[3026.90 --> 3027.90]  Amen.
[3027.90 --> 3028.90]  Amen.
[3028.90 --> 3029.90]  Amen.
[3029.90 --> 3030.74]  Amen.
[3030.76 --> 3044.00]  Good morning, everybody.
[3044.48 --> 3049.98]  I'm really glad that Mike didn't break out into the fruit of the spirit's not a coconut and
[3049.98 --> 3050.96]  getting the kids all going with that.
[3050.96 --> 3054.34]  I'm thankful for that, but it is a fun song.
[3055.56 --> 3058.94]  Before we go to God and our family prayer,
[3059.14 --> 3062.30]  some notes from our full council meeting that we had this past week.
[3063.88 --> 3065.66]  It's a long walk up from the back there.
[3068.24 --> 3071.84]  First of all, as council, we looked at the new safe church policy,
[3071.84 --> 3073.94]  and then we're implementing that in the new year.
[3074.46 --> 3077.12]  And so just keep an eye on that if you're ministry leaders
[3077.12 --> 3079.70]  or volunteers in different ministries,
[3079.70 --> 3083.18]  that that's something that we want to make sure is happening and going well,
[3083.38 --> 3085.40]  because that's a very good thing to have at church.
[3086.26 --> 3090.08]  We also approved the financial statements from 2022,
[3090.82 --> 3095.28]  and coming up soon on June 22nd, we have an annual general meeting,
[3095.78 --> 3097.94]  starting with a 6 o'clock barbecue,
[3098.36 --> 3101.06]  and then at 7 p.m. we'll have a meeting of members,
[3102.52 --> 3106.16]  and there are packages that are emailed to the membership list.
[3106.66 --> 3109.00]  If you didn't get one, then please talk to the office.
[3109.70 --> 3114.12]  We also heard reports from our pastors and the work that they are doing there,
[3114.26 --> 3117.82]  the relationships that they are continuing to foster and grow,
[3118.38 --> 3121.64]  and the wonderful ways that we're seeing God at work in Emmanuel.
[3122.84 --> 3125.42]  After that, we went to Ken's house.
[3125.92 --> 3130.06]  He and Amanda opened their home for us to have an end-of-year social
[3130.06 --> 3132.94]  to say thanks to those who had completed their terms
[3132.94 --> 3135.40]  and to welcome our new office pairs as well.
[3137.32 --> 3138.58]  And one other note,
[3139.12 --> 3144.28]  Wes Chepkima went in earlier this week for some surgery with a concerning growth,
[3144.50 --> 3146.48]  and they were able to get it all.
[3146.70 --> 3148.56]  So this is good news, and we thank God for that.
[3150.56 --> 3153.24]  All right, if you can please bow your heads with me
[3153.24 --> 3155.04]  and join me in our church family prayer.
[3155.04 --> 3156.70]  Let's pray.
[3160.60 --> 3162.76]  God is our refuge and strength,
[3163.80 --> 3165.36]  an ever-present help in trouble.
[3166.60 --> 3168.10]  Therefore we will not fear,
[3168.86 --> 3170.02]  though the earth give way
[3170.02 --> 3172.56]  and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea,
[3173.20 --> 3175.24]  though its waters roar and foam
[3175.24 --> 3177.54]  and the mountains quake with their surging.
[3177.54 --> 3180.26]  Father God,
[3181.10 --> 3182.00]  Christ Jesus,
[3182.86 --> 3183.66]  Holy Spirit,
[3184.26 --> 3186.08]  we worship and adore you
[3186.08 --> 3190.28]  as we gather as your called people together today in this place.
[3191.38 --> 3193.52]  You are eternally faithful,
[3194.22 --> 3194.60]  powerful,
[3195.14 --> 3195.64]  and loving.
[3196.54 --> 3198.36]  You are completely trustworthy,
[3199.10 --> 3200.70]  and you hold all of time,
[3201.30 --> 3202.06]  our times,
[3202.38 --> 3204.26]  and the cosmos in your hands.
[3204.26 --> 3207.34]  You provide for all of our needs
[3207.34 --> 3209.48]  and cause streams of living water
[3209.48 --> 3211.10]  to spring up in dry places.
[3212.76 --> 3216.14]  There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God,
[3216.70 --> 3219.42]  the holy place where the Most High dwells.
[3220.26 --> 3221.20]  God is within her.
[3221.70 --> 3222.68]  She will not fall.
[3223.54 --> 3225.26]  God will help her at break of day.
[3226.58 --> 3227.84]  Nations are in uproar.
[3228.70 --> 3229.54]  Kingdoms fall.
[3230.04 --> 3231.10]  He lifts his voice.
[3231.72 --> 3232.64]  The earth melts.
[3232.64 --> 3236.06]  The Lord Almighty is with us.
[3236.62 --> 3238.74]  The God of Jacob is our fortress.
[3240.82 --> 3243.68]  And yet we waver in our faith to you
[3243.68 --> 3245.58]  and in our service for you.
[3246.32 --> 3249.36]  We confess that we are creatures of comfort
[3249.36 --> 3250.74]  with wandering hearts.
[3251.60 --> 3255.34]  We acknowledge that we often equate our temporary pains
[3255.34 --> 3256.88]  with your ultimate suffering,
[3257.86 --> 3260.40]  selfishly seeking to console ourselves
[3260.40 --> 3264.14]  instead of deeply desiring to serve the least of these
[3264.14 --> 3266.06]  or to care for your creation.
[3267.32 --> 3267.94]  Forgive us
[3267.94 --> 3271.72]  and empower us to turn towards your way,
[3272.12 --> 3273.58]  keeping in step with your spirit.
[3273.58 --> 3278.60]  We humbly ask that while we await your return,
[3279.24 --> 3281.52]  that you continue to graciously grant us
[3281.52 --> 3282.82]  what we stand in need of.
[3283.90 --> 3285.30]  We ask for patience
[3285.30 --> 3288.90]  and for a tangible sense of your presence and comfort
[3288.90 --> 3291.72]  for those awaiting results from tests,
[3292.42 --> 3294.00]  for those awaiting healing,
[3294.76 --> 3297.70]  for those recovering from surgeries or treatments,
[3297.70 --> 3302.32]  for those caring for aging family or challenging dependence,
[3303.12 --> 3305.38]  for those who struggle with mental health,
[3306.08 --> 3309.14]  for those who experience brokenness and hurt,
[3309.70 --> 3312.92]  and especially for those who mourn the loss of loved ones.
[3312.92 --> 3317.46]  Grant that each of us may act on the call
[3317.46 --> 3318.88]  to bear one another's burdens
[3318.88 --> 3321.60]  as if it were Christ acting through us.
[3322.82 --> 3326.28]  We also humbly ask for your mercy for our world,
[3327.28 --> 3330.68]  suffering deeply through wars, famines, and injustice.
[3333.02 --> 3335.12]  Come and see what the Lord has done,
[3335.94 --> 3338.02]  the desolations he has brought on the earth.
[3338.46 --> 3341.26]  He makes wars cease to the ends of the earth.
[3341.26 --> 3344.18]  He breaks the bow and shatters the spear.
[3344.76 --> 3346.62]  He burns the shields with fire.
[3349.08 --> 3350.64]  We thank you for this church,
[3351.18 --> 3354.18]  as well as for the denomination of which we are one part.
[3355.28 --> 3358.04]  Bless the representatives who have gathered for Synod recently
[3358.04 --> 3358.98]  and this week,
[3359.42 --> 3361.12]  enabling them to discern your will
[3361.12 --> 3363.88]  for our greater church body in our current context.
[3365.06 --> 3367.08]  We also thank you for the new members
[3367.08 --> 3368.88]  and interest in our church
[3369.18 --> 3371.16]  and ask that they will feel connected
[3371.16 --> 3373.44]  and guided to utilize the gifts
[3373.44 --> 3374.62]  that you have given them
[3374.62 --> 3377.46]  as they continue to grow in faith with us.
[3380.08 --> 3382.94]  As we enter into a time of hearing your word proclaimed,
[3383.40 --> 3385.68]  we ask that you will give us ears to hear
[3385.68 --> 3387.12]  and eyes to see
[3387.12 --> 3389.50]  and that you will speak your word of life
[3389.50 --> 3390.60]  through Pastor Chris.
[3390.60 --> 3395.76]  Be still and know that I am God.
[3396.76 --> 3398.64]  I will be exalted among the nations.
[3399.44 --> 3401.28]  I will be exalted in the earth.
[3402.36 --> 3404.56]  The Lord Almighty is with us.
[3405.34 --> 3407.58]  The God of Jacob is our fortress.
[3408.68 --> 3408.96]  Amen.
[3420.60 --> 3430.82]  As I come up here this morning,
[3430.92 --> 3434.02]  I can't help but notice Mr. Mike left his fruit up here.
[3435.46 --> 3437.12]  And so if any of you are distracted
[3437.12 --> 3438.60]  for the next little while
[3438.60 --> 3439.54]  or you need a snack,
[3440.08 --> 3441.20]  just come on up to the front.
[3441.72 --> 3442.50]  Go ahead and grab one.
[3442.88 --> 3445.08]  I'm also grateful that it's not full of tomatoes.
[3445.08 --> 3448.36]  Although I did hear once
[3448.36 --> 3450.58]  that being smart is knowing
[3450.58 --> 3452.46]  that tomato is a fruit.
[3452.94 --> 3455.44]  Being wise is not putting tomatoes in fruit salad.
[3456.04 --> 3458.04]  And so maybe tomato as a fruit of the Spirit
[3458.04 --> 3460.12]  is not viable.
[3460.34 --> 3462.22]  And maybe Mr. Mike is just showing us
[3462.22 --> 3463.20]  how wise he is
[3463.20 --> 3465.10]  by not having tomatoes up here.
[3467.12 --> 3468.62]  But seriously, if you want a fruit,
[3468.96 --> 3469.76]  they're here.
[3470.26 --> 3472.00]  Just like the harvest table at the back,
[3472.00 --> 3474.44]  help yourself at some point in our time together.
[3475.08 --> 3479.14]  We're going to read together from Romans 8.
[3479.46 --> 3482.08]  And so I'm going to invite you to open up a Bible
[3482.08 --> 3485.60]  or get your phone or tablet
[3485.60 --> 3488.20]  or whatever it is that you read the Bible on
[3488.20 --> 3490.34]  and turn to Romans 8.
[3490.42 --> 3493.82]  We're going to read starting at verse 18 together
[3493.82 --> 3497.34]  through verse 27.
[3500.94 --> 3502.32]  With God's Word open,
[3502.32 --> 3503.76]  let's read together.
[3505.08 --> 3509.84]  I consider that our present sufferings
[3509.84 --> 3511.60]  are not worth comparing
[3511.60 --> 3514.56]  with the glory that will be revealed in us.
[3515.40 --> 3518.66]  For the creation waits in eager expectation
[3518.66 --> 3520.78]  for the children of God to be revealed.
[3521.46 --> 3525.28]  For the creation was subjected to frustration
[3525.28 --> 3527.40]  not by its own choice,
[3527.50 --> 3529.86]  but by the will of the one who subjected it
[3529.86 --> 3532.78]  in hope that the creation itself
[3532.78 --> 3535.92]  will be liberated from its bondage to decay
[3535.92 --> 3538.92]  and brought into the freedom and glory
[3538.92 --> 3540.46]  of the children of God.
[3542.06 --> 3544.78]  We know that the whole creation
[3544.78 --> 3548.42]  has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth
[3548.42 --> 3550.70]  right up to the present time.
[3550.70 --> 3553.96]  Not only so, but we ourselves,
[3553.96 --> 3556.74]  who have the first fruits of the Spirit,
[3557.22 --> 3560.12]  groan inwardly as we wait eagerly
[3560.12 --> 3561.86]  for our adoption to sonship,
[3562.18 --> 3564.20]  the redemption of our bodies.
[3565.20 --> 3568.36]  For in this hope we were saved.
[3568.36 --> 3572.32]  But hope that is seen is no hope at all.
[3573.04 --> 3576.06]  Who hopes for what they already have?
[3577.22 --> 3580.76]  But if we have hope for what we do not yet have,
[3580.94 --> 3583.02]  we wait for it patiently.
[3584.72 --> 3586.08]  In the same way,
[3586.22 --> 3588.24]  the Spirit helps us in our weakness.
[3589.12 --> 3591.78]  We do not know what we ought to pray for,
[3591.88 --> 3594.48]  but the Spirit himself intercedes for us
[3594.48 --> 3596.52]  through wordless groans.
[3596.52 --> 3601.36]  And he who searches our hearts
[3601.36 --> 3603.46]  knows the mind of the Spirit
[3603.46 --> 3607.26]  because the Spirit intercedes for God's people
[3607.26 --> 3610.68]  in accordance with the will of God.
[3611.42 --> 3612.96]  This is the word of the Lord.
[3618.08 --> 3623.46]  As I was preparing for this message
[3623.46 --> 3626.60]  and looking at the text
[3626.60 --> 3632.36]  and struggling through how to preach on it,
[3633.06 --> 3638.32]  I realized that at least three times
[3638.32 --> 3640.62]  in our series in the book of Romans,
[3640.62 --> 3643.22]  I have said something along the lines of,
[3643.56 --> 3647.02]  now this might just be my favorite verse in the Bible.
[3647.02 --> 3651.16]  And I'm going to do that again this morning.
[3652.12 --> 3653.62]  Now I want to acknowledge that
[3653.62 --> 3655.94]  because I don't want to suggest
[3655.94 --> 3658.54]  that I'm trivializing the verses of the Bible.
[3658.64 --> 3659.72]  I think the struggle that I face
[3659.72 --> 3661.38]  is that I love the Bible so much
[3661.38 --> 3663.08]  and I love Romans so much
[3663.08 --> 3665.38]  that there's just so much here
[3665.38 --> 3667.76]  that I hope and pray that you will see.
[3668.42 --> 3669.50]  But this verse,
[3669.78 --> 3671.00]  this first verse,
[3671.30 --> 3672.14]  verse 18,
[3672.14 --> 3674.84]  I consider that our present sufferings
[3674.84 --> 3676.28]  are not worth comparing
[3676.28 --> 3679.14]  with the glory that will be revealed in us
[3679.14 --> 3686.66]  is perhaps one of my absolute favorites.
[3687.42 --> 3689.18]  Our present suffering
[3689.18 --> 3691.50]  are not worth comparing
[3691.50 --> 3695.92]  to the glory that will be revealed in us.
[3697.60 --> 3699.96]  What does that even mean?
[3699.96 --> 3701.88]  How is that even possible?
[3703.80 --> 3705.64]  And I think one of the reasons
[3705.64 --> 3709.52]  why it's so beautiful and compelling to me
[3709.52 --> 3710.82]  is in fact,
[3711.04 --> 3714.80]  because I have a very realistic picture
[3714.80 --> 3716.32]  and experience
[3716.32 --> 3722.00]  of how deep and dark and hard life can be.
[3722.80 --> 3726.76]  How real our present struggles can be.
[3726.76 --> 3730.98]  The reality for some of us here this morning,
[3731.06 --> 3733.80]  maybe for every single person here this morning,
[3733.92 --> 3735.96]  is that we are in the midst
[3735.96 --> 3741.72]  of some pretty awful, crappy, hard times.
[3743.00 --> 3746.02]  And when things are really bad,
[3746.30 --> 3749.28]  sometimes this verse seems impossible.
[3749.28 --> 3755.06]  And sometimes we've heard people use this verse
[3755.06 --> 3756.26]  in the midst of our struggles
[3756.26 --> 3758.78]  in a really kind of cheesy way,
[3758.92 --> 3759.92]  and it doesn't help us.
[3759.94 --> 3762.36]  It doesn't make us feel any better.
[3764.22 --> 3766.62]  Our present sufferings right now,
[3766.70 --> 3767.40]  there might be anything.
[3767.78 --> 3769.10]  It could be cancer
[3769.10 --> 3770.68]  or it could be being canceled.
[3771.36 --> 3772.38]  It could be addiction
[3772.38 --> 3774.04]  or it could be adultery.
[3774.24 --> 3775.68]  It could be miscarriage
[3775.68 --> 3777.28]  or it could be a manic episode.
[3777.28 --> 3778.38]  Right?
[3778.50 --> 3780.68]  Sometimes our present sufferings
[3780.68 --> 3781.94]  are so real
[3781.94 --> 3783.52]  that nothing else is.
[3785.22 --> 3786.32]  Our present sufferings
[3786.32 --> 3787.26]  are the only thing
[3787.26 --> 3789.04]  that we can get present to.
[3790.58 --> 3791.30]  And look,
[3791.36 --> 3793.36]  as we dig into this text,
[3793.46 --> 3797.00]  far from minimizing your suffering,
[3797.42 --> 3799.66]  what I believe this verse wants us to do
[3799.66 --> 3800.88]  is to maximize
[3800.88 --> 3803.48]  our experience
[3803.48 --> 3804.38]  and our idea
[3804.38 --> 3805.28]  and our encounter
[3805.28 --> 3807.38]  with the glory of God
[3807.38 --> 3808.14]  to come.
[3810.66 --> 3811.54]  And so as we begin,
[3811.70 --> 3812.70]  I want to start
[3812.70 --> 3814.82]  with a bit of a thought experiment
[3814.82 --> 3815.74]  with you.
[3816.88 --> 3817.28]  Really,
[3817.42 --> 3819.58]  it's an emotional counseling process.
[3820.30 --> 3821.76]  And so if you've met with me
[3821.76 --> 3822.38]  for counseling,
[3822.54 --> 3824.02]  we might have done an exercise like this.
[3824.06 --> 3825.18]  If you meet with another counselor,
[3825.26 --> 3826.44]  you might have done something like this.
[3826.44 --> 3828.32]  But in your head
[3828.32 --> 3829.44]  or in your heart,
[3830.04 --> 3830.78]  in that place
[3830.78 --> 3832.44]  where your imagination dwells,
[3833.88 --> 3835.56]  I want you to think of
[3835.56 --> 3837.44]  all your present suffering.
[3839.64 --> 3839.86]  Right?
[3839.88 --> 3841.64]  Everything that you are facing.
[3841.84 --> 3843.02]  Pull it all together
[3843.02 --> 3844.24]  in your imagination.
[3844.64 --> 3845.62]  Really think about it.
[3847.34 --> 3847.52]  Right?
[3847.58 --> 3848.24]  Think about this
[3848.24 --> 3849.20]  like a conversation
[3849.20 --> 3850.46]  with a counselor.
[3850.46 --> 3853.08]  And so take all of that crap,
[3853.48 --> 3854.62]  take all of that bad,
[3854.78 --> 3855.78]  take all of that trauma,
[3856.18 --> 3856.96]  take everything.
[3857.40 --> 3858.62]  And you know what it is.
[3858.84 --> 3858.94]  Right?
[3859.06 --> 3860.24]  Take even that thing
[3860.24 --> 3861.52]  that you've never told anyone.
[3862.66 --> 3863.14]  Right?
[3863.18 --> 3864.26]  That secret thing.
[3864.96 --> 3867.14]  Take all of that present suffering
[3867.14 --> 3868.50]  and maybe,
[3868.68 --> 3869.28]  if it helps you,
[3869.38 --> 3870.44]  maybe close your eyes.
[3871.28 --> 3871.76]  Right?
[3871.80 --> 3872.86]  And then picture it
[3872.86 --> 3874.00]  in front of you.
[3875.20 --> 3876.06]  Remember it
[3876.06 --> 3878.22]  in your brain space.
[3879.42 --> 3880.32]  And maybe for you,
[3880.32 --> 3880.68]  right now,
[3880.70 --> 3881.58]  it looks like a box
[3881.58 --> 3883.64]  and it's just piling full.
[3884.70 --> 3886.02]  Maybe it looks like an ocean
[3886.02 --> 3887.98]  with waves crashing over top
[3887.98 --> 3889.36]  and crashing down
[3889.36 --> 3890.16]  and around everywhere.
[3890.30 --> 3891.84]  Maybe it's a black abyss.
[3892.40 --> 3892.50]  Right?
[3892.58 --> 3893.86]  Maybe it's a list
[3893.86 --> 3895.22]  longer than your arm.
[3895.68 --> 3895.94]  Maybe,
[3896.16 --> 3897.52]  as I call this to mind,
[3897.78 --> 3898.86]  it's a person.
[3899.66 --> 3900.58]  It's a face
[3900.58 --> 3902.10]  that represents
[3902.10 --> 3903.26]  all your suffering.
[3905.26 --> 3906.40]  Maybe it's a bottle.
[3907.52 --> 3908.32]  Maybe it's a needle.
[3908.32 --> 3908.76]  Right?
[3908.76 --> 3908.98]  Maybe it's a circle.
[3909.38 --> 3910.48]  Whatever it is,
[3910.54 --> 3911.78]  I want you to see it.
[3912.84 --> 3914.00]  Hold it in your mind.
[3915.64 --> 3916.58]  And now holding that
[3916.58 --> 3917.10]  in your mind,
[3917.72 --> 3918.72]  here's what I want you to,
[3918.90 --> 3920.10]  here's what I need you to see.
[3921.18 --> 3921.36]  Right?
[3921.38 --> 3922.68]  As you are looking at it,
[3922.74 --> 3923.44]  whatever it is
[3923.44 --> 3924.16]  you are thinking about,
[3924.20 --> 3924.98]  whether it's an ocean
[3924.98 --> 3925.94]  or a list,
[3926.26 --> 3927.12]  whatever it is,
[3927.40 --> 3927.98]  notice
[3927.98 --> 3930.80]  there are edges.
[3932.64 --> 3933.08]  Right?
[3933.08 --> 3934.70]  It's a bounded set.
[3936.46 --> 3936.70]  Right?
[3936.78 --> 3937.68]  There's limits
[3937.68 --> 3940.28]  to your suffering.
[3941.22 --> 3941.32]  Right?
[3941.36 --> 3943.06]  Even oceans have limits.
[3944.60 --> 3944.78]  Okay?
[3944.82 --> 3945.40]  And so here it is.
[3945.52 --> 3947.16]  No matter how big
[3947.16 --> 3948.60]  or how bad
[3948.60 --> 3950.16]  or how crappy
[3950.16 --> 3952.86]  your present sufferings may be,
[3953.08 --> 3954.74]  there is a limit to them.
[3955.56 --> 3956.72]  There is a boundary.
[3956.72 --> 3957.16]  Right?
[3957.26 --> 3958.10]  Your struggle
[3958.10 --> 3960.20]  is not infinite.
[3961.46 --> 3962.26]  And I get it.
[3962.74 --> 3963.44]  I get it.
[3963.52 --> 3963.80]  I do.
[3964.16 --> 3964.30]  Right?
[3964.38 --> 3965.54]  That when the waves
[3965.54 --> 3966.72]  are crashing over you,
[3967.38 --> 3968.58]  when you are in the middle
[3968.58 --> 3969.64]  of the abyss,
[3969.88 --> 3971.66]  you can't see those edges.
[3972.46 --> 3974.12]  And you can't see those limits.
[3974.66 --> 3974.82]  Right?
[3974.84 --> 3975.80]  When you're in the middle of it,
[3975.84 --> 3978.36]  it feels like there is no end.
[3978.42 --> 3980.06]  It feels infinite.
[3980.06 --> 3981.74]  And I know that sometimes
[3981.74 --> 3984.18]  perception does define reality
[3984.18 --> 3986.48]  or at least your experience of it.
[3987.16 --> 3988.88]  And if that's where you are,
[3989.06 --> 3989.98]  if you're in the middle
[3989.98 --> 3991.90]  of that dark night of the soul,
[3992.02 --> 3994.06]  in the middle of that present suffering,
[3994.06 --> 3996.18]  and you can't see the edges,
[3997.66 --> 3999.78]  let me be really clear.
[4000.98 --> 4002.66]  We want to jump in with you.
[4004.54 --> 4005.06]  Right?
[4005.06 --> 4006.38]  I don't say that just for myself.
[4007.60 --> 4008.04]  Right?
[4008.04 --> 4009.70]  We want to enter into that with you.
[4009.70 --> 4011.44]  I mean that for everyone here,
[4011.50 --> 4012.70]  for the pastors who are here,
[4012.80 --> 4013.82]  for the elders who are here,
[4013.94 --> 4016.14]  for the care groups that are present
[4016.14 --> 4017.08]  and do life with you,
[4017.16 --> 4019.38]  every person here wants to jump
[4019.38 --> 4020.70]  into that with you
[4020.70 --> 4023.54]  so that you're not alone
[4023.54 --> 4024.74]  in the middle of it.
[4024.74 --> 4026.36]  Because sometimes we can't see
[4026.36 --> 4028.00]  those edges and so we need people
[4028.00 --> 4029.86]  in our lives to remind us
[4029.86 --> 4031.02]  that they're there.
[4033.10 --> 4034.34]  But for those of us
[4034.34 --> 4035.64]  with the eyes to see it,
[4037.08 --> 4038.16]  your present sufferings
[4038.84 --> 4040.84]  are not the end of the story.
[4040.84 --> 4043.40]  So let's not make it the end
[4043.40 --> 4044.16]  of your story.
[4045.72 --> 4045.84]  Right?
[4045.88 --> 4046.62]  As Christians,
[4047.04 --> 4049.70]  we believe that only God
[4049.70 --> 4050.70]  is infinite.
[4051.10 --> 4052.34]  That nothing else is
[4052.34 --> 4054.14]  nor nothing else can be.
[4054.52 --> 4056.34]  Only God is infinite.
[4057.24 --> 4059.18]  Now, I don't want to get bogged down
[4059.18 --> 4060.10]  in the particulars
[4060.10 --> 4061.16]  of the doctrine of God,
[4061.22 --> 4062.26]  but I do want to give you
[4062.26 --> 4062.92]  some of it.
[4063.30 --> 4063.64]  And so,
[4063.88 --> 4065.46]  as Christians,
[4065.84 --> 4066.84]  we believe,
[4066.94 --> 4067.96]  and I'm going to use the words
[4067.96 --> 4069.58]  of the Belgic Confession here,
[4070.52 --> 4071.96]  we believe that there is
[4071.96 --> 4073.82]  a single and simple
[4073.82 --> 4075.26]  spiritual being
[4075.26 --> 4077.02]  whom we call God,
[4077.80 --> 4079.54]  who is eternal,
[4080.22 --> 4081.14]  incomprehensible,
[4081.50 --> 4081.96]  invisible,
[4082.38 --> 4083.14]  unchangeable,
[4083.42 --> 4083.84]  infinite,
[4084.22 --> 4084.66]  almighty,
[4085.22 --> 4086.22]  completely wise,
[4086.42 --> 4087.16]  just and good,
[4087.26 --> 4088.76]  and the overflowing source
[4088.76 --> 4090.30]  of all good.
[4092.56 --> 4094.54]  Now, sometimes you might hear
[4094.54 --> 4096.08]  all of that summarized
[4096.08 --> 4098.14]  in those omni words,
[4098.26 --> 4098.44]  right?
[4099.08 --> 4099.62]  Omnipotent,
[4099.72 --> 4100.94]  which means all-powerful,
[4101.32 --> 4101.92]  omniscient,
[4102.04 --> 4103.14]  which means all-knowing,
[4103.50 --> 4104.14]  omnipresent,
[4104.34 --> 4105.56]  which means everywhere present,
[4105.96 --> 4107.46]  and omnibenevolent,
[4107.60 --> 4108.42]  which means all
[4108.42 --> 4109.94]  or supremely good.
[4111.14 --> 4111.26]  Right?
[4111.64 --> 4112.88]  God alone
[4112.88 --> 4114.64]  is infinite.
[4115.10 --> 4116.32]  Your present struggles
[4116.32 --> 4117.54]  are not.
[4119.76 --> 4121.06]  Because you are not.
[4121.56 --> 4122.32]  And because the world
[4122.32 --> 4123.14]  you live in
[4123.14 --> 4124.00]  is not.
[4124.00 --> 4125.92]  And so now,
[4126.12 --> 4127.22]  track this with me,
[4127.30 --> 4127.46]  right?
[4127.74 --> 4129.08]  If God is infinite
[4129.08 --> 4130.22]  and God invites you
[4130.22 --> 4130.92]  to Himself,
[4131.24 --> 4132.42]  He is inviting you
[4132.42 --> 4133.18]  to see,
[4133.62 --> 4134.64]  to taste,
[4134.86 --> 4135.90]  and to touch.
[4136.32 --> 4137.62]  And remember that image
[4137.62 --> 4138.54]  when we come to the table
[4138.54 --> 4139.24]  in just a moment,
[4139.34 --> 4139.50]  right?
[4139.56 --> 4140.96]  God is inviting you
[4140.96 --> 4142.02]  to see Himself.
[4142.54 --> 4143.50]  He is inviting you
[4143.50 --> 4145.14]  to see His infinity.
[4145.86 --> 4147.56]  That is glory.
[4149.78 --> 4151.56]  Our present sufferings
[4151.56 --> 4152.90]  are not worth comparing
[4152.90 --> 4154.36]  with the glory
[4154.36 --> 4155.52]  that will be revealed
[4155.52 --> 4156.54]  in us.
[4158.14 --> 4159.64]  One person that I read
[4159.64 --> 4160.12]  this week,
[4160.78 --> 4161.40]  he said this.
[4161.46 --> 4161.70]  He said,
[4162.22 --> 4163.64]  the glory of God
[4163.64 --> 4165.28]  is the manifest beauty
[4165.28 --> 4166.72]  of His holiness.
[4168.06 --> 4168.96]  His holiness
[4168.96 --> 4171.16]  is what He is as God
[4171.16 --> 4172.58]  that nobody else is.
[4173.64 --> 4174.88]  It is His quality
[4174.88 --> 4175.70]  of perfection
[4175.70 --> 4177.26]  that can't be improved upon,
[4177.36 --> 4178.38]  that can't be imitated,
[4178.68 --> 4179.74]  that is incomparable,
[4179.74 --> 4181.46]  that determines all that He is
[4181.46 --> 4182.18]  and is determined
[4182.18 --> 4182.80]  by nothing
[4182.80 --> 4183.86]  from outside of Him.
[4184.42 --> 4185.42]  It signifies
[4185.42 --> 4186.44]  His infinite worth,
[4186.54 --> 4187.54]  His intrinsic,
[4187.82 --> 4189.20]  infinite value.
[4190.48 --> 4191.96]  The glory of God
[4191.96 --> 4193.52]  is the going public
[4193.52 --> 4194.94]  of His holiness.
[4199.14 --> 4201.84]  There's a preacher
[4201.84 --> 4202.88]  and theologian
[4202.88 --> 4204.16]  from the 18th century.
[4205.00 --> 4205.62]  Jonathan Edwards
[4205.62 --> 4206.26]  is his name,
[4206.26 --> 4208.52]  and he meditates
[4208.52 --> 4209.32]  and reflects
[4209.32 --> 4210.42]  upon the glory
[4210.42 --> 4211.02]  of God
[4211.02 --> 4212.46]  in a poetic
[4212.46 --> 4213.50]  and beautiful way
[4213.50 --> 4215.32]  like few other theologians
[4215.32 --> 4216.96]  in the past have.
[4217.78 --> 4218.68]  And he says
[4218.68 --> 4220.22]  that the glory
[4220.22 --> 4220.98]  of God
[4220.98 --> 4222.28]  is the communication
[4222.28 --> 4223.78]  of the infinite
[4223.78 --> 4225.28]  fullness of God
[4225.28 --> 4226.58]  to the creature.
[4229.48 --> 4230.86]  Let me put that
[4230.86 --> 4231.32]  another way.
[4232.68 --> 4233.28]  Glory
[4233.28 --> 4235.00]  is what you see
[4235.00 --> 4236.62]  when God reveals Himself.
[4239.00 --> 4239.70]  Okay, remember that.
[4239.78 --> 4240.12]  Glory
[4240.12 --> 4241.12]  is what you see
[4241.12 --> 4242.68]  when God reveals Himself.
[4243.76 --> 4245.14]  So take this all now,
[4245.52 --> 4246.60]  this who God is
[4246.60 --> 4247.64]  and what He is revealing
[4247.64 --> 4248.44]  of Himself,
[4248.56 --> 4249.18]  take that back
[4249.18 --> 4249.94]  to verse 18.
[4250.86 --> 4251.56]  I consider
[4251.56 --> 4252.82]  that our present sufferings
[4252.82 --> 4254.04]  are not worth comparing
[4254.04 --> 4254.94]  to the glory
[4254.94 --> 4256.24]  that will be revealed
[4256.24 --> 4256.88]  in us
[4256.88 --> 4258.06]  or to us.
[4258.90 --> 4259.64]  The glory
[4259.64 --> 4260.60]  that will be revealed
[4260.60 --> 4261.40]  to us
[4261.40 --> 4262.90]  is God Himself.
[4263.28 --> 4265.38]  And I'll put it
[4265.38 --> 4265.98]  real simply,
[4266.34 --> 4267.88]  there ain't nothing
[4267.88 --> 4269.04]  bigger or better
[4269.04 --> 4270.10]  than God Himself.
[4272.10 --> 4274.24]  Your present sufferings
[4274.24 --> 4275.76]  actually do
[4275.76 --> 4277.38]  pale and Paul
[4277.38 --> 4278.38]  in comparison
[4278.38 --> 4281.00]  to who God is.
[4284.50 --> 4286.08]  Revelation 21
[4286.08 --> 4287.36]  tells us
[4287.36 --> 4287.92]  how this
[4287.92 --> 4289.00]  will happen.
[4289.78 --> 4290.38]  We're going to put
[4290.38 --> 4290.96]  three verses
[4290.96 --> 4291.80]  on the screen
[4291.80 --> 4292.50]  overhead,
[4292.66 --> 4293.36]  but I'm going to
[4293.36 --> 4294.14]  invert the order
[4294.14 --> 4295.02]  that I read them
[4295.02 --> 4295.92]  so that you can see
[4295.92 --> 4296.64]  the logic here.
[4297.30 --> 4298.12]  In Revelation 21
[4298.12 --> 4298.74]  verse 5
[4298.74 --> 4299.38]  we read,
[4300.22 --> 4300.98]  He will wipe away
[4300.98 --> 4301.78]  every tear
[4301.78 --> 4302.58]  from their eyes
[4302.58 --> 4302.98]  and there will be
[4302.98 --> 4303.70]  no more death
[4303.70 --> 4304.38]  or mourning
[4304.38 --> 4305.08]  or crying
[4305.08 --> 4305.66]  or pain
[4305.66 --> 4306.68]  for the old order
[4306.68 --> 4307.76]  has passed away.
[4309.14 --> 4309.98]  Now how does this happen?
[4310.44 --> 4311.44]  Why does that happen?
[4312.44 --> 4312.94]  In the verses
[4312.94 --> 4313.54]  right before,
[4313.68 --> 4314.16]  John says,
[4314.16 --> 4314.86]  look,
[4315.62 --> 4317.20]  God's dwelling place
[4317.20 --> 4317.92]  is now
[4317.92 --> 4319.34]  among the people
[4319.34 --> 4321.26]  and He dwells
[4321.26 --> 4322.34]  with them.
[4324.32 --> 4325.40]  God is there
[4325.40 --> 4326.98]  and you can see Him.
[4327.76 --> 4329.34]  That's the future glory
[4329.34 --> 4330.96]  that now works backwards
[4330.96 --> 4332.80]  to make your present sufferings
[4332.80 --> 4334.00]  incomparable
[4334.00 --> 4335.40]  to that reality.
[4336.10 --> 4336.58]  And again,
[4336.70 --> 4337.82]  we're not minimizing
[4337.82 --> 4339.18]  your present sufferings,
[4339.30 --> 4340.66]  we're maximizing
[4340.66 --> 4342.04]  what we will see
[4342.04 --> 4343.06]  when we look to God
[4343.06 --> 4343.62]  at the end.
[4344.94 --> 4345.92]  And for Paul,
[4346.16 --> 4348.04]  here in Romans 8,
[4348.48 --> 4349.86]  one of the ways
[4349.86 --> 4350.68]  that you can know
[4350.68 --> 4351.90]  this to be true
[4351.90 --> 4353.98]  is by looking
[4353.98 --> 4355.20]  at creation itself.
[4356.72 --> 4357.96]  In verse 19,
[4358.72 --> 4359.62]  Paul writes,
[4360.82 --> 4361.62]  for the creation
[4361.62 --> 4363.68]  waits an eager expectation
[4363.68 --> 4365.36]  for the children of God
[4365.36 --> 4366.70]  to be revealed.
[4368.22 --> 4370.30]  Even the creation itself,
[4370.70 --> 4371.82]  the very world
[4371.82 --> 4372.60]  and universe
[4372.60 --> 4373.74]  that we live in
[4373.74 --> 4375.62]  is waiting for the day
[4375.62 --> 4377.50]  when God's dwelling place
[4377.50 --> 4379.92]  will be among His people.
[4380.38 --> 4381.50]  Creation is waiting
[4381.50 --> 4382.34]  for the day
[4382.34 --> 4383.70]  when creation
[4383.70 --> 4384.94]  will be restored
[4384.94 --> 4386.80]  to its original design
[4386.80 --> 4387.74]  and intent
[4387.74 --> 4388.58]  and purpose
[4388.58 --> 4389.48]  from God.
[4390.14 --> 4391.66]  For the creation
[4391.66 --> 4392.88]  was subjected
[4392.88 --> 4394.60]  to frustration,
[4395.28 --> 4396.70]  not by its own choice,
[4396.80 --> 4397.60]  but by the will
[4397.60 --> 4398.18]  of the one
[4398.18 --> 4399.00]  who subjected it,
[4399.04 --> 4399.56]  that is God,
[4399.56 --> 4400.52]  in the hope
[4400.52 --> 4402.34]  that creation itself
[4402.34 --> 4403.38]  will be liberated
[4403.38 --> 4405.28]  from its bondage
[4405.28 --> 4406.90]  to decay
[4406.90 --> 4408.72]  and then brought
[4408.72 --> 4409.56]  into the freedom
[4409.56 --> 4410.86]  and glory
[4410.86 --> 4411.74]  of the children
[4411.74 --> 4413.20]  of God.
[4414.88 --> 4416.72]  The through line
[4416.72 --> 4418.90]  of the theological argument
[4418.90 --> 4420.50]  that Paul has been stacking
[4420.50 --> 4422.20]  on through the book
[4422.20 --> 4422.88]  of Romans
[4422.88 --> 4424.84]  is that when Adam
[4424.84 --> 4425.56]  and Eve
[4425.56 --> 4427.04]  rebelled against God
[4427.04 --> 4428.16]  in the Garden of Eden,
[4428.16 --> 4429.36]  all of humanity,
[4429.52 --> 4430.50]  all of their descendants
[4430.50 --> 4431.14]  after them
[4431.14 --> 4432.36]  fell into sin
[4432.36 --> 4433.80]  and now
[4433.80 --> 4434.64]  all of us
[4434.64 --> 4435.60]  by the result
[4435.60 --> 4436.94]  of that action
[4436.94 --> 4438.02]  are impacted
[4438.02 --> 4439.22]  by sin.
[4439.40 --> 4440.70]  Everything we do
[4440.70 --> 4441.90]  is in some way
[4441.90 --> 4442.50]  marred
[4442.50 --> 4443.42]  or stained
[4443.42 --> 4444.88]  by sin.
[4445.88 --> 4446.06]  Now,
[4446.12 --> 4447.00]  let me be really clear
[4447.00 --> 4447.76]  when I say that,
[4447.82 --> 4447.94]  right?
[4448.10 --> 4449.42]  That doesn't mean
[4449.42 --> 4450.74]  that you are as bad
[4450.74 --> 4452.08]  as you possibly could be.
[4452.80 --> 4454.24]  That's a mistaken way
[4454.24 --> 4455.76]  to read the Bible.
[4455.76 --> 4457.00]  The Bible doesn't say
[4457.00 --> 4458.18]  that about humanity.
[4458.34 --> 4459.36]  The Bible says
[4459.36 --> 4460.32]  that humanity
[4460.32 --> 4461.60]  struggles with sin
[4461.60 --> 4462.70]  in everything,
[4463.02 --> 4464.26]  in every area
[4464.26 --> 4465.46]  of their life.
[4465.58 --> 4466.32]  Its effects
[4466.32 --> 4467.48]  are pervasive
[4467.48 --> 4468.92]  and so our desires,
[4469.12 --> 4469.62]  our wills,
[4469.68 --> 4470.10]  our minds,
[4470.24 --> 4470.84]  our bodies
[4470.84 --> 4472.24]  are all impacted
[4472.24 --> 4473.34]  by the presence
[4473.34 --> 4473.78]  of sin.
[4474.76 --> 4475.22]  And now,
[4475.38 --> 4478.44]  what Paul is advancing here,
[4478.56 --> 4479.68]  what we're learning here,
[4480.44 --> 4482.76]  is that creation itself
[4482.76 --> 4485.84]  reflects that same frustration.
[4487.62 --> 4487.88]  Right?
[4487.92 --> 4488.96]  Because humanity,
[4489.18 --> 4490.86]  as the crown of creation,
[4491.30 --> 4492.52]  rebelled against God
[4492.52 --> 4493.58]  and is now affected
[4493.58 --> 4494.62]  by sin,
[4494.74 --> 4496.28]  so too is everything
[4496.28 --> 4498.72]  that flows from humanity
[4498.72 --> 4501.16]  in that sort of creation hierarchy
[4501.16 --> 4502.06]  that exists.
[4502.76 --> 4502.86]  Right?
[4502.88 --> 4504.30]  The frustration of creation
[4504.30 --> 4504.98]  to sin
[4504.98 --> 4505.72]  is because,
[4506.28 --> 4507.44]  or because of sin,
[4507.76 --> 4508.50]  is a symbol
[4508.50 --> 4510.52]  of our own frustration
[4510.52 --> 4511.36]  in the world.
[4511.36 --> 4513.06]  And that symbol
[4513.06 --> 4514.16]  doesn't just stop
[4514.16 --> 4514.84]  reflecting
[4514.84 --> 4516.52]  the current reality,
[4516.88 --> 4517.84]  that symbol
[4517.84 --> 4518.68]  extends
[4518.68 --> 4520.70]  to the hoped-for reality
[4520.70 --> 4521.92]  of a new creation,
[4522.20 --> 4523.24]  of a renewed earth.
[4524.66 --> 4525.16]  And so,
[4525.32 --> 4526.40]  very clearly,
[4527.48 --> 4527.82]  right,
[4527.90 --> 4528.92]  very clearly
[4528.92 --> 4530.34]  in the world today,
[4530.54 --> 4532.52]  you don't have to look far
[4532.52 --> 4533.20]  to see
[4533.20 --> 4534.20]  how creation
[4534.20 --> 4535.26]  is frustrated.
[4536.80 --> 4537.10]  Right?
[4537.16 --> 4538.88]  Across our country,
[4539.04 --> 4540.34]  there are wildfires
[4540.34 --> 4541.00]  that are burning
[4541.00 --> 4541.90]  out of control.
[4543.14 --> 4543.28]  Right?
[4543.38 --> 4545.78]  And where there aren't fires,
[4545.98 --> 4546.86]  there's smoke
[4546.86 --> 4547.54]  that's causing
[4547.54 --> 4549.42]  poor air quality warnings
[4549.42 --> 4550.60]  in a huge region.
[4551.84 --> 4552.98]  In some regions
[4552.98 --> 4553.84]  of the world,
[4553.94 --> 4554.56]  there is drought
[4554.56 --> 4555.86]  that is leading to famine,
[4556.12 --> 4557.02]  and in other places,
[4557.02 --> 4557.94]  there is flooding
[4557.94 --> 4558.94]  that is destroying
[4558.94 --> 4560.06]  homes and cities.
[4561.42 --> 4562.12]  And we know
[4562.12 --> 4563.16]  that communities
[4563.16 --> 4564.28]  on the margins
[4564.28 --> 4566.22]  are disproportionately affected
[4566.22 --> 4567.86]  by the impact
[4567.86 --> 4568.46]  of the climate.
[4569.10 --> 4569.58]  We know
[4569.58 --> 4570.42]  that biodiversity
[4570.42 --> 4571.30]  rates,
[4571.86 --> 4574.14]  the range
[4574.14 --> 4575.22]  of speciation
[4575.22 --> 4575.82]  that occurs
[4575.82 --> 4576.62]  in the world,
[4576.96 --> 4578.36]  biodiversity rates
[4578.36 --> 4579.04]  are dropping
[4579.04 --> 4580.30]  as people move
[4580.30 --> 4581.10]  more and more
[4581.10 --> 4582.10]  into previously
[4582.10 --> 4583.68]  wildland areas
[4583.68 --> 4585.10]  and take it over.
[4586.24 --> 4587.10]  Right now,
[4587.22 --> 4588.46]  in the Pacific Ocean,
[4589.16 --> 4590.24]  there is a garbage
[4590.24 --> 4591.56]  island floating around
[4591.56 --> 4592.42]  that is larger
[4592.42 --> 4593.22]  than the province
[4593.22 --> 4593.72]  of BC.
[4595.46 --> 4596.48]  Think about that.
[4599.28 --> 4600.56]  It's not a stretch
[4600.56 --> 4601.28]  to see
[4601.28 --> 4602.40]  how creation
[4602.40 --> 4603.50]  is in bondage
[4603.50 --> 4604.06]  to decay.
[4605.44 --> 4605.68]  Right?
[4605.72 --> 4606.16]  And in fact,
[4606.30 --> 4607.18]  it's not just
[4607.18 --> 4608.10]  that little picture
[4608.10 --> 4609.12]  of planet Earth.
[4609.80 --> 4610.18]  Right?
[4610.20 --> 4611.02]  The whole universe
[4611.02 --> 4612.10]  is in bondage
[4612.10 --> 4612.60]  to decay.
[4613.34 --> 4613.54]  Now,
[4613.58 --> 4614.56]  I'm not an expert here,
[4614.64 --> 4615.26]  and so I trust
[4615.26 --> 4616.38]  that Ken is going
[4616.38 --> 4617.44]  to correct me afterwards.
[4617.68 --> 4617.84]  Ken,
[4617.88 --> 4618.44]  I'm looking at you.
[4618.76 --> 4619.54]  But in physics
[4619.54 --> 4620.44]  and in engineering,
[4620.82 --> 4621.54]  the second law
[4621.54 --> 4622.44]  of thermodynamics,
[4622.66 --> 4623.20]  the law of energy,
[4623.22 --> 4623.60]  entropy,
[4624.18 --> 4625.06]  says that since
[4625.06 --> 4626.98]  energy can neither
[4626.98 --> 4627.50]  be created
[4627.50 --> 4628.18]  nor destroyed,
[4628.38 --> 4629.50]  systems will always
[4629.50 --> 4630.64]  move from increased
[4630.64 --> 4631.28]  organization
[4631.28 --> 4632.24]  to decreased
[4632.24 --> 4633.28]  organization.
[4633.50 --> 4634.16]  That will happen
[4634.16 --> 4634.60]  naturally.
[4635.10 --> 4635.60]  And so physicists
[4635.60 --> 4636.48]  talk literally
[4636.48 --> 4637.24]  about the Earth
[4637.24 --> 4638.36]  flattening out,
[4638.46 --> 4639.06]  or the universe
[4639.06 --> 4640.50]  flattening out.
[4642.90 --> 4644.00]  Right now,
[4644.36 --> 4645.22]  there is only
[4645.22 --> 4646.12]  death
[4646.12 --> 4647.50]  and decomposition.
[4648.50 --> 4648.96]  Everything
[4648.96 --> 4649.76]  is running
[4649.76 --> 4650.68]  down.
[4651.48 --> 4652.08]  One person
[4652.08 --> 4652.72]  said,
[4652.88 --> 4653.12]  nature
[4653.12 --> 4653.90]  is currently
[4653.90 --> 4654.50]  a killer.
[4657.54 --> 4658.66]  But none
[4658.66 --> 4659.32]  of that
[4659.32 --> 4660.78]  is the last
[4660.78 --> 4661.16]  word.
[4662.86 --> 4662.96]  Right?
[4663.04 --> 4663.50]  Creation
[4663.50 --> 4664.14]  itself
[4664.14 --> 4664.90]  will be
[4664.90 --> 4665.44]  liberated.
[4666.00 --> 4666.56]  And instead
[4666.56 --> 4667.38]  of frustration,
[4667.84 --> 4668.38]  there will be
[4668.38 --> 4669.00]  fulfillment.
[4669.66 --> 4670.12]  Instead of
[4670.12 --> 4670.58]  bondage
[4670.58 --> 4671.08]  to decay,
[4671.24 --> 4671.64]  there will be
[4671.64 --> 4672.24]  beauty
[4672.24 --> 4673.08]  and endless
[4673.08 --> 4673.64]  delight.
[4674.08 --> 4674.18]  Right?
[4674.26 --> 4674.98]  Even with
[4674.98 --> 4676.20]  all the frustrations
[4676.20 --> 4676.96]  that are visible
[4676.96 --> 4677.76]  in the world
[4677.76 --> 4678.22]  today,
[4678.22 --> 4679.48]  it is still
[4679.48 --> 4680.88]  easy to find
[4680.88 --> 4682.40]  majestic beauty
[4682.40 --> 4683.58]  in creation.
[4684.10 --> 4684.82]  Especially
[4684.82 --> 4685.84]  when we live
[4685.84 --> 4686.14]  here,
[4686.22 --> 4686.44]  right?
[4686.54 --> 4687.20]  Surrounded by
[4687.20 --> 4688.18]  mountains and
[4688.18 --> 4688.70]  lakes and
[4688.70 --> 4690.54]  ancient rainforests.
[4690.54 --> 4691.32]  And so it's
[4691.32 --> 4692.74]  almost impossible,
[4693.32 --> 4693.80]  it's almost
[4693.80 --> 4694.82]  unfathomable
[4694.82 --> 4696.82]  to imagine
[4696.82 --> 4697.68]  what the world
[4697.68 --> 4698.82]  will be like
[4698.82 --> 4699.42]  then.
[4702.42 --> 4703.36]  You think
[4703.36 --> 4704.18]  camp is awesome.
[4705.38 --> 4706.18]  Just wait.
[4706.18 --> 4708.50]  Right?
[4708.56 --> 4709.02]  Instead of
[4709.02 --> 4709.58]  things getting
[4709.58 --> 4710.72]  older and
[4710.72 --> 4711.60]  weaker and
[4711.60 --> 4712.68]  flattening out,
[4713.12 --> 4713.76]  there will be
[4713.76 --> 4714.78]  a new and
[4714.78 --> 4715.94]  a beauty and
[4715.94 --> 4717.08]  a strength,
[4717.24 --> 4718.70]  a foreverness
[4718.70 --> 4719.76]  to the world.
[4719.98 --> 4720.46]  Instead of
[4720.46 --> 4721.28]  pain and
[4721.28 --> 4722.28]  present suffering,
[4722.52 --> 4723.02]  there will be
[4723.02 --> 4724.06]  only joy in
[4724.06 --> 4724.74]  the glory of
[4724.74 --> 4725.60]  God because
[4725.60 --> 4726.82]  God is here
[4726.82 --> 4727.30]  and has made
[4727.30 --> 4727.88]  His dwelling
[4727.88 --> 4729.10]  among us.
[4732.62 --> 4733.18]  Now,
[4733.38 --> 4734.84]  I don't want
[4734.84 --> 4735.78]  to stay on
[4735.78 --> 4736.30]  this point for
[4736.30 --> 4737.02]  too long because
[4737.02 --> 4737.48]  I don't want
[4737.48 --> 4738.10]  to detract from
[4738.10 --> 4738.80]  the bigger point
[4738.80 --> 4739.84]  that Paul is
[4739.84 --> 4740.46]  making here,
[4740.54 --> 4741.34]  but we have
[4741.34 --> 4742.00]  to at least
[4742.00 --> 4743.00]  acknowledge this.
[4743.64 --> 4743.90]  Right?
[4744.00 --> 4745.00]  This view of
[4745.00 --> 4746.86]  creation regained,
[4747.06 --> 4748.14]  this view of
[4748.14 --> 4748.76]  the universe
[4748.76 --> 4749.54]  restored,
[4750.14 --> 4751.36]  is for us
[4751.36 --> 4752.12]  as Christians
[4752.12 --> 4752.94]  who believe
[4752.94 --> 4753.62]  in the truth
[4753.62 --> 4754.42]  of the Bible
[4754.42 --> 4755.90]  a motivating
[4755.90 --> 4757.08]  force to go
[4757.08 --> 4757.70]  out into
[4757.70 --> 4758.20]  the world
[4758.20 --> 4759.24]  now and
[4759.24 --> 4760.06]  live in the
[4760.06 --> 4760.98]  hope of
[4760.98 --> 4761.92]  this restoration.
[4761.92 --> 4762.04]  creation.
[4763.04 --> 4763.84]  And so,
[4764.02 --> 4764.96]  we are not
[4764.96 --> 4766.40]  overcome by
[4766.40 --> 4767.36]  the fear of
[4767.36 --> 4768.54]  climate change,
[4768.90 --> 4769.82]  but we are
[4769.82 --> 4770.76]  actively trying
[4770.76 --> 4771.54]  to hold it
[4771.54 --> 4772.44]  at bay as
[4772.44 --> 4773.20]  a picture of
[4773.20 --> 4773.56]  what God
[4773.56 --> 4774.20]  promised to
[4774.20 --> 4775.28]  do in the
[4775.28 --> 4775.60]  world.
[4776.78 --> 4777.22]  And we
[4777.22 --> 4778.12]  recognize that
[4778.12 --> 4778.98]  creation is
[4778.98 --> 4779.72]  subject to
[4779.72 --> 4780.54]  frustration
[4780.54 --> 4781.70]  because of
[4781.70 --> 4782.36]  human sin,
[4782.48 --> 4783.66]  and so we
[4783.66 --> 4784.36]  fight against
[4784.36 --> 4785.66]  human sin that
[4785.66 --> 4786.84]  perpetuates the
[4786.84 --> 4787.50]  frustration of
[4787.50 --> 4787.98]  creation.
[4787.98 --> 4790.40]  that the
[4790.40 --> 4790.94]  fact that
[4790.94 --> 4791.72]  God will
[4791.72 --> 4792.88]  renew the
[4792.88 --> 4793.88]  world doesn't
[4793.88 --> 4794.96]  stop us from
[4794.96 --> 4795.88]  living towards
[4795.88 --> 4797.32]  the goal of
[4797.32 --> 4797.76]  a renewed
[4797.76 --> 4798.40]  world now.
[4799.36 --> 4800.62]  It spurs our
[4800.62 --> 4802.04]  action forward.
[4802.86 --> 4802.94]  Right?
[4803.00 --> 4803.82]  Humanity has
[4803.82 --> 4804.24]  been given
[4804.24 --> 4804.98]  charge to
[4804.98 --> 4806.04]  care for and
[4806.04 --> 4806.76]  to cultivate
[4806.76 --> 4807.82]  this world,
[4808.08 --> 4808.84]  and our shared
[4808.84 --> 4809.62]  rebellion and
[4809.62 --> 4810.60]  fall into sin
[4810.60 --> 4811.72]  doesn't end
[4811.72 --> 4812.80]  that call.
[4813.06 --> 4813.60]  Hear that
[4813.60 --> 4814.44]  very clearly.
[4814.92 --> 4815.48]  And the
[4815.48 --> 4816.34]  reality of sin
[4816.34 --> 4817.20]  makes living
[4817.20 --> 4818.62]  in response to
[4818.62 --> 4819.38]  that call much
[4819.38 --> 4820.12]  more difficult.
[4820.56 --> 4821.00]  Absolutely.
[4821.42 --> 4821.74]  But the
[4821.74 --> 4823.30]  responsibility is
[4823.30 --> 4824.68]  still there.
[4828.52 --> 4829.28]  Now Paul
[4829.28 --> 4830.98]  continues his
[4830.98 --> 4831.34]  metaphor.
[4832.02 --> 4832.60]  He continues
[4832.60 --> 4833.14]  his metaphor
[4833.14 --> 4834.18]  for the
[4834.18 --> 4835.22]  endurance of
[4835.22 --> 4835.72]  present
[4835.72 --> 4837.70]  sufferings by
[4837.70 --> 4839.52]  listing and
[4839.52 --> 4840.72]  comparing three
[4840.72 --> 4842.48]  instances of
[4842.48 --> 4843.10]  groaning.
[4843.60 --> 4844.02]  And this is
[4844.02 --> 4844.30]  what we're going
[4844.30 --> 4844.84]  to look at to
[4844.84 --> 4846.28]  wrap us up and
[4846.28 --> 4846.80]  to bring us to
[4846.80 --> 4847.18]  the table.
[4849.00 --> 4850.16]  In verse 22,
[4850.60 --> 4853.10]  we read that
[4853.10 --> 4853.92]  the whole
[4853.92 --> 4855.14]  creation has
[4855.14 --> 4855.94]  been groaning
[4855.94 --> 4856.56]  as in the
[4856.56 --> 4857.18]  pains of
[4857.18 --> 4858.26]  childbirth right
[4858.26 --> 4859.18]  up to the
[4859.18 --> 4859.74]  present time.
[4860.26 --> 4860.56]  And then in
[4860.56 --> 4861.16]  verse 23,
[4861.38 --> 4862.10]  you read that
[4862.10 --> 4862.64]  we groan
[4862.64 --> 4863.56]  inwardly as
[4863.56 --> 4864.16]  we await our
[4864.16 --> 4864.82]  adoption, our
[4864.82 --> 4865.16]  redemption.
[4865.92 --> 4866.34]  And then in
[4866.34 --> 4867.76]  26, we read
[4867.76 --> 4868.40]  that the Spirit
[4868.40 --> 4869.74]  himself intercedes
[4869.74 --> 4870.54]  for us with
[4870.54 --> 4872.08]  wordless groans.
[4873.22 --> 4873.96]  Now all of
[4873.96 --> 4874.86]  this groaning
[4874.86 --> 4875.72]  groaning is a
[4875.72 --> 4877.30]  word picture to
[4877.30 --> 4878.66]  help you endure
[4878.66 --> 4880.00]  whatever present
[4880.00 --> 4881.12]  struggle you
[4881.12 --> 4881.80]  might be in.
[4882.92 --> 4883.72]  All of this
[4883.72 --> 4884.68]  groaning is to
[4884.68 --> 4885.08]  help you
[4885.08 --> 4886.08]  captivate and
[4886.08 --> 4887.84]  be captivated by
[4887.84 --> 4888.96]  a vision of
[4888.96 --> 4889.72]  that future
[4889.72 --> 4890.52]  glory.
[4892.12 --> 4892.66]  And so like we
[4892.66 --> 4893.52]  said in 22,
[4893.72 --> 4894.28]  Paul says that
[4894.28 --> 4895.30]  creation has been
[4895.30 --> 4896.20]  groaning in the
[4896.20 --> 4896.68]  pangs of
[4896.68 --> 4897.48]  childbirth right
[4897.48 --> 4898.48]  up to the
[4898.48 --> 4899.04]  present time.
[4900.16 --> 4901.14]  This is an
[4901.14 --> 4902.88]  excellent image for
[4902.88 --> 4903.62]  what Paul has
[4903.62 --> 4904.06]  been showing
[4904.06 --> 4904.48]  us.
[4905.36 --> 4905.96]  If you've ever
[4905.96 --> 4906.88]  given birth or
[4906.88 --> 4907.48]  if you've watched
[4907.48 --> 4908.58]  someone give
[4908.58 --> 4909.98]  birth, you know
[4909.98 --> 4910.92]  how immensely
[4910.92 --> 4912.06]  painful it is.
[4913.42 --> 4914.28]  Now let's be
[4914.28 --> 4914.92]  clear, right, if
[4914.92 --> 4915.50]  you've only ever
[4915.50 --> 4916.22]  watched it, you
[4916.22 --> 4917.12]  have an idea, you
[4917.12 --> 4917.64]  don't actually
[4917.64 --> 4918.64]  know, so don't
[4918.64 --> 4919.16]  pretend to take
[4919.16 --> 4919.66]  credit for it.
[4919.72 --> 4920.20]  My wife is
[4920.20 --> 4920.74]  saying thank you
[4920.74 --> 4921.28]  for clarifying
[4921.28 --> 4921.52]  that.
[4922.94 --> 4923.72]  But what you
[4923.72 --> 4925.14]  see, right, is
[4925.14 --> 4926.66]  that the pain of
[4926.66 --> 4928.74]  childbirth proves
[4928.74 --> 4930.78]  worth it when you
[4930.78 --> 4931.50]  hold your child.
[4931.50 --> 4933.90]  The suffering of
[4933.90 --> 4935.24]  labor and delivery
[4935.24 --> 4936.42]  is worth the
[4936.42 --> 4937.56]  future glory of
[4937.56 --> 4938.56]  holding your son
[4938.56 --> 4939.54]  or your daughter.
[4940.62 --> 4941.34]  And like I said,
[4941.42 --> 4942.64]  I've never given
[4942.64 --> 4944.74]  birth, but I
[4944.74 --> 4945.52]  know that this is
[4945.52 --> 4946.52]  true because for
[4946.52 --> 4947.54]  the vast majority
[4947.54 --> 4948.72]  of human history,
[4949.18 --> 4950.06]  most women who
[4950.06 --> 4950.92]  have given birth
[4950.92 --> 4951.88]  have done it more
[4951.88 --> 4952.42]  than once.
[4954.26 --> 4955.96]  Quite simply, if
[4955.96 --> 4956.52]  it wasn't worth
[4956.52 --> 4957.66]  it, she wouldn't
[4957.66 --> 4958.18]  do it twice.
[4958.18 --> 4958.24]  else.
[4961.32 --> 4963.36]  Similarly, we
[4963.36 --> 4965.92]  groan inwardly as
[4965.92 --> 4966.42]  we wait.
[4967.34 --> 4968.32]  As we endure
[4968.32 --> 4969.16]  these present
[4969.16 --> 4970.06]  sufferings, we
[4970.06 --> 4971.76]  groan in hope.
[4972.58 --> 4972.76]  Right?
[4972.80 --> 4973.60]  We have hope that
[4973.60 --> 4974.92]  we are saved, but a
[4974.92 --> 4976.06]  hope that is seen is
[4976.06 --> 4977.42]  no hope at all, Paul
[4977.42 --> 4977.70]  says.
[4977.80 --> 4978.62]  The point is that
[4978.62 --> 4979.98]  even though you
[4979.98 --> 4981.56]  can't see the future
[4981.56 --> 4983.56]  glory, you can see
[4983.56 --> 4984.30]  the world around
[4984.30 --> 4984.58]  you.
[4984.58 --> 4986.12]  Right?
[4986.16 --> 4986.76]  And the world
[4986.76 --> 4987.88]  around you itself
[4987.88 --> 4989.34]  is a picture of
[4989.34 --> 4990.12]  what is to come.
[4991.40 --> 4991.90]  Right?
[4991.94 --> 4992.70]  The picture is
[4992.70 --> 4993.46]  subject to
[4993.46 --> 4994.94]  frustration, yet
[4994.94 --> 4995.76]  in our heart of
[4995.76 --> 4996.88]  hearts, right, we
[4996.88 --> 4997.84]  look at the great
[4997.84 --> 4999.02]  Pacific floating
[4999.02 --> 5000.66]  garbage island, and
[5000.66 --> 5001.64]  we know that that's
[5001.64 --> 5002.34]  not the way it's
[5002.34 --> 5003.04]  supposed to be.
[5003.86 --> 5004.94]  That that's wrong,
[5005.08 --> 5005.82]  and we should do
[5005.82 --> 5006.70]  something about it.
[5007.02 --> 5008.48]  And we long for a
[5008.48 --> 5009.62]  day when that will
[5009.62 --> 5011.54]  be made new, a day
[5011.54 --> 5012.32]  that God has
[5012.32 --> 5013.90]  promised will come.
[5013.90 --> 5014.74]  And I pray that
[5014.74 --> 5015.58]  that day comes
[5015.58 --> 5016.42]  soon.
[5017.42 --> 5018.56]  But our inward
[5018.56 --> 5020.02]  groaning, even as
[5020.02 --> 5021.10]  we look at
[5021.10 --> 5022.48]  creation, is in
[5022.48 --> 5024.96]  fact a sign that
[5024.96 --> 5026.30]  it will come.
[5026.94 --> 5027.66]  And so we are
[5027.66 --> 5029.96]  sustained in the
[5029.96 --> 5030.64]  present suffering.
[5031.72 --> 5035.76]  And then lastly, as
[5035.76 --> 5037.86]  well, in the
[5037.86 --> 5039.58]  present suffering, we
[5039.58 --> 5040.86]  are given a
[5040.86 --> 5041.20]  gift.
[5041.20 --> 5043.58]  In the same way, the
[5043.58 --> 5044.70]  Spirit helps us in
[5044.70 --> 5045.36]  our weakness.
[5046.28 --> 5047.36]  We do not know what
[5047.36 --> 5048.36]  we ought to pray for,
[5048.68 --> 5049.28]  but the Spirit
[5049.28 --> 5051.06]  himself intercedes for
[5051.06 --> 5052.98]  us through wordless
[5052.98 --> 5053.74]  groans.
[5055.42 --> 5057.00]  God gives you his
[5057.00 --> 5059.34]  Spirit to help you
[5059.34 --> 5061.04]  endure your present
[5061.04 --> 5062.18]  sufferings.
[5063.52 --> 5064.78]  I cannot tell you how
[5064.78 --> 5065.60]  many times I have
[5065.60 --> 5066.66]  heard the testimony of
[5066.66 --> 5068.10]  people who have gone
[5068.10 --> 5069.56]  through some incredibly
[5069.56 --> 5071.06]  difficult life
[5071.06 --> 5071.70]  challenge.
[5071.94 --> 5073.26]  And they look back on
[5073.26 --> 5074.04]  that moment and they
[5074.04 --> 5075.88]  go, I did not believe
[5075.88 --> 5077.12]  it was possible to get
[5077.12 --> 5077.40]  through.
[5078.62 --> 5079.78]  And yet here I am.
[5080.52 --> 5081.46]  That's the Spirit.
[5082.96 --> 5084.92]  That's God walking
[5084.92 --> 5086.90]  with you in the midst
[5086.90 --> 5087.94]  of the seeming
[5087.94 --> 5088.64]  impossible.
[5090.48 --> 5091.88]  And even when we don't
[5091.88 --> 5093.24]  know what to pray for,
[5093.44 --> 5094.16]  when our present
[5094.16 --> 5096.44]  suffering is so awful,
[5096.44 --> 5097.62]  we can't even put it
[5097.62 --> 5100.06]  into words, the Spirit
[5100.06 --> 5102.26]  himself intercedes
[5102.26 --> 5104.60]  with wordless groans.
[5104.74 --> 5104.86]  Right?
[5104.98 --> 5106.56]  Even as you pray to
[5106.56 --> 5108.32]  God, God's Spirit is
[5108.32 --> 5109.38]  praying over you.
[5110.32 --> 5111.44]  In times when the
[5111.44 --> 5112.92]  present struggle feels
[5112.92 --> 5114.52]  like an abyss or an
[5114.52 --> 5116.38]  ocean crashing over you
[5116.38 --> 5117.52]  and you just don't know
[5117.52 --> 5119.02]  what to say or what to
[5119.02 --> 5120.52]  pray and you just cry,
[5120.76 --> 5121.90]  you just groan,
[5122.28 --> 5124.82]  that is God with you.
[5124.82 --> 5128.30]  causing you to endure
[5128.30 --> 5129.98]  by the Spirit.
[5132.10 --> 5133.54]  And listen, listen to
[5133.54 --> 5135.40]  this promise.
[5135.60 --> 5137.50]  The last words of our
[5137.50 --> 5137.84]  text.
[5139.12 --> 5140.46]  He who searches our
[5140.46 --> 5142.04]  hearts knows the mind
[5142.04 --> 5143.36]  of the Spirit because
[5143.36 --> 5145.26]  the Spirit intercedes for
[5145.26 --> 5146.30]  God's people in
[5146.30 --> 5147.50]  accordance with the
[5147.50 --> 5149.84]  will of God.
[5149.84 --> 5153.18]  At the beginning, we
[5153.18 --> 5154.64]  started looking at the
[5154.64 --> 5156.52]  glory of God.
[5157.56 --> 5159.50]  The will of God, the
[5159.50 --> 5161.26]  ultimate purpose of God
[5161.26 --> 5162.48]  in creating and
[5162.48 --> 5163.94]  sustaining and saving
[5163.94 --> 5166.90]  the world is His own
[5166.90 --> 5167.76]  glory.
[5168.88 --> 5170.66]  God's glory will be
[5170.66 --> 5172.32]  revealed and His Spirit
[5172.32 --> 5174.06]  right here, right now,
[5174.14 --> 5175.88]  is interceding for God's
[5175.88 --> 5177.10]  people in accordance with
[5177.10 --> 5178.64]  that will, with that
[5178.64 --> 5179.58]  direction, with that
[5179.58 --> 5180.72]  end of history.
[5180.86 --> 5181.88]  And so, no matter
[5181.88 --> 5183.84]  what, no matter what,
[5184.76 --> 5186.94]  our present sufferings
[5186.94 --> 5188.42]  are not worth comparing
[5188.42 --> 5190.64]  to the glory that will
[5190.64 --> 5193.34]  be revealed in us.
[5193.68 --> 5194.00]  Amen?
[5196.38 --> 5197.78]  Tim Keller has a line.
[5199.40 --> 5200.40]  I want to share it with
[5200.40 --> 5201.84]  you because, as many of
[5201.84 --> 5203.54]  you know, Tim Keller
[5203.54 --> 5204.82]  recently died.
[5204.82 --> 5208.10]  And overwhelmingly, as
[5208.10 --> 5210.62]  eulogies and testimonies
[5210.62 --> 5212.34]  of his impact on so many
[5212.34 --> 5213.76]  people, myself included,
[5214.16 --> 5215.74]  were pouring in online
[5215.74 --> 5217.28]  and in person,
[5217.88 --> 5220.54]  people said something to
[5220.54 --> 5222.52]  the effect of, Tim showed
[5222.52 --> 5224.84]  us that no matter how hard
[5224.84 --> 5226.22]  life got, whether it was
[5226.22 --> 5228.60]  pancreatic cancer or the
[5228.60 --> 5231.58]  struggles of being in a
[5231.58 --> 5233.08]  cultural limelight and in
[5233.08 --> 5234.74]  opposition to the ways of
[5234.74 --> 5236.32]  the world, no matter how
[5236.32 --> 5238.90]  hard it got, he showed us
[5238.90 --> 5240.16]  what it looked like to live
[5240.16 --> 5242.36]  faithfully for the glory of
[5242.36 --> 5242.70]  God.
[5244.20 --> 5245.62]  A couple weeks ago, he died
[5245.62 --> 5246.88]  in that hope.
[5247.60 --> 5249.36]  Tim Keller has a line that
[5249.36 --> 5249.72]  says,
[5250.30 --> 5253.44]  all our best days lie ahead
[5253.44 --> 5257.70]  of us, and one day all our
[5257.70 --> 5260.18]  painful days will lie behind
[5260.18 --> 5260.56]  us.
[5264.78 --> 5266.50]  I consider that our present
[5266.50 --> 5267.80]  sufferings are not worth
[5267.80 --> 5269.98]  comparing to the glory that
[5269.98 --> 5272.66]  will be revealed in us.
[5274.46 --> 5276.98]  And until that day, we gather
[5276.98 --> 5277.36]  here.
[5278.12 --> 5280.02]  Until that day, we come to
[5280.02 --> 5281.72]  this table to be strengthened
[5281.72 --> 5282.84]  and nourished.
[5282.94 --> 5284.46]  Until that day, we gather
[5284.46 --> 5286.64]  together as a church family,
[5287.30 --> 5289.24]  that we might receive from
[5289.24 --> 5290.98]  God the grace that he
[5290.98 --> 5292.88]  offers to us in the word,
[5292.96 --> 5294.30]  that we might receive from
[5294.30 --> 5296.38]  God the strength and the
[5296.38 --> 5298.28]  nourishment to endure.
[5299.18 --> 5300.24]  And so in just a moment, we
[5300.24 --> 5302.06]  are going to come to the table
[5302.06 --> 5303.18]  of our Lord.
[5303.24 --> 5305.52]  And as we do, there is a
[5305.52 --> 5306.86]  liturgy that we will move
[5306.86 --> 5308.98]  through, and then we will come
[5308.98 --> 5310.54]  and gather around the table.
[5310.54 --> 5312.36]  I will invite you and instruct
[5312.36 --> 5314.26]  you on how to do that at the
[5314.26 --> 5314.54]  time.
[5314.90 --> 5316.76]  As we come to the table, you
[5316.76 --> 5318.68]  join your hearts with mine in
[5318.68 --> 5319.60]  prayer together.
[5320.00 --> 5320.48]  Let's pray.
[5327.72 --> 5329.90]  With joy, we praise you,
[5330.12 --> 5332.50]  gracious God, for you have
[5332.50 --> 5333.90]  created heaven and earth.
[5334.46 --> 5336.14]  You have made us in your image
[5336.14 --> 5338.12]  and have kept covenant with us,
[5338.28 --> 5340.64]  even when we fell into sin.
[5342.36 --> 5344.44]  And so here and now, we give
[5344.44 --> 5346.12]  you thanks for Jesus Christ,
[5346.52 --> 5348.64]  who by his life, death, and
[5348.64 --> 5350.46]  resurrection, opened to us the
[5350.46 --> 5352.90]  way of life everlasting.
[5355.18 --> 5358.12]  It is in Jesus' name that we pray.
[5359.36 --> 5359.70]  Amen.
[5359.70 --> 5359.84]  Amen.
[5360.90 --> 5361.46]  Amen.
[5363.66 --> 5365.24]  As we come to the table, I
[5365.24 --> 5367.10]  invite you to join in our
[5367.10 --> 5367.98]  liturgy.
[5368.36 --> 5369.42]  Lift up your hearts.
[5369.42 --> 5374.06]  Let us give thanks to the Lord,
[5374.16 --> 5374.72]  our God.
[5378.84 --> 5381.88]  Our Lord Jesus, before he
[5381.88 --> 5384.62]  suffered, gave us this memorial
[5384.62 --> 5387.80]  of his sacrifice until he comes
[5387.80 --> 5388.14]  again.
[5389.18 --> 5390.92]  The Lord Jesus, on the night that
[5390.92 --> 5394.02]  he was betrayed, took bread.
[5394.68 --> 5396.96]  And when he had given thanks, he
[5396.96 --> 5399.20]  broke it and said, this is my
[5399.20 --> 5400.86]  body, which is for you.
[5401.52 --> 5404.72]  Do this in remembrance of me.
[5407.18 --> 5409.70]  In the same way, he took the
[5409.70 --> 5412.38]  cup after supper, and he said,
[5412.50 --> 5415.48]  this cup is the new covenant in
[5415.48 --> 5416.06]  my blood.
[5416.74 --> 5419.90]  Do this in remembrance of me.
[5419.90 --> 5423.12]  For whenever you eat this bread
[5423.12 --> 5425.24]  and drink this cup, you
[5425.24 --> 5426.92]  proclaim the Lord's death
[5426.92 --> 5429.48]  until he comes again.
[5430.32 --> 5431.86]  And so we gather at this table
[5431.86 --> 5434.50]  proclaiming the mystery of
[5434.50 --> 5435.80]  our faith.
[5437.10 --> 5439.40]  Your death, O Christ, we
[5439.40 --> 5439.84]  proclaim.
[5440.64 --> 5442.24]  Your resurrection, we
[5442.24 --> 5443.30]  affirm with joy.
[5444.22 --> 5446.14]  Your coming, we await with hope.
[5447.04 --> 5449.08]  Glory be to you, Lord Jesus.
[5449.08 --> 5449.24]  Jesus.
[5451.40 --> 5453.34]  Church family, the Lord has
[5453.34 --> 5455.36]  prepared his table for all who
[5455.36 --> 5457.74]  love him and who trust in him
[5457.74 --> 5459.42]  alone for their salvation.
[5459.98 --> 5462.34]  And so, come to this table, you
[5462.34 --> 5464.80]  who have much faith and you who
[5464.80 --> 5465.82]  would like to have more.
[5466.54 --> 5468.50]  Come to this table, you who have
[5468.50 --> 5470.54]  been to this sacrament often and
[5470.54 --> 5472.40]  you who have not been in a long
[5472.40 --> 5473.02]  time.
[5473.14 --> 5474.72]  Come to this table, you who have
[5474.72 --> 5477.72]  tried to follow Jesus and you who
[5477.72 --> 5478.52]  have failed.
[5479.30 --> 5481.54]  Come to this table because Jesus
[5481.54 --> 5482.84]  Christ is raised.
[5483.22 --> 5484.56]  Come to this table because our
[5484.56 --> 5486.36]  present sufferings are not worth
[5486.36 --> 5488.62]  comparing to the glory that would
[5488.62 --> 5491.22]  be revealed in us.
[5491.94 --> 5492.30]  Come.
[5492.52 --> 5494.30]  If you are here or if you are at
[5494.30 --> 5496.38]  home and online, come because it
[5496.38 --> 5499.30]  is Christ who invites us to this
[5499.30 --> 5500.26]  table.
[5500.80 --> 5503.52]  The gifts of God for the people of
[5503.52 --> 5503.84]  God.
[5505.84 --> 5508.30]  As we come to this table, if you
[5508.30 --> 5510.50]  are visiting with us, we do so in a
[5510.50 --> 5512.92]  particular way here where we come
[5512.92 --> 5515.54]  sort of line by line through the
[5515.54 --> 5517.50]  space and we gather in a circle
[5517.50 --> 5519.60]  around the table and then you will
[5519.60 --> 5522.62]  get the bread and I will pass it to
[5522.62 --> 5524.22]  you or an elder will pass it to you
[5524.22 --> 5526.28]  and say, the body of Christ given for
[5526.28 --> 5526.52]  you.
[5526.66 --> 5529.00]  Please repeat that line as you pass it
[5529.00 --> 5531.36]  to the person beside you and so on,
[5531.36 --> 5533.82]  down and around and likewise with the
[5533.82 --> 5536.16]  juice when it comes, we say the blood

[5547.12 --> 5549.24]  to come up to the first table and
[5549.24 --> 5551.12]  then our worship teams will lead us
[5551.12 --> 5554.84]  through and we will sing as we go
[5554.84 --> 5556.32]  through and then there will be ushers
[5556.32 --> 5558.00]  indicating when you can come.

[5560.62 --> 5562.82]  together, if you would like, either
[5562.82 --> 5565.02]  before coming to the table or instead
[5565.02 --> 5566.30]  of coming to the table, if you would
[5566.30 --> 5567.66]  like prayer, if you would like someone
[5567.66 --> 5569.68]  to meet with you, there are people who
[5569.68 --> 5571.54]  will be in the foyer at the back and
[5571.54 --> 5573.14]  they will have yellow name tags on.

[5590.12 --> 5591.40]  this morning to the front?
[5616.30 --> 5621.06]  And I'm hoping that, if you should do
[5621.28 --> 5623.28]  need the support of theänder, don't

[6145.26 --> 6152.76]  Nailed to a cross of hope.
[6152.76 --> 6162.00]  This is the power of the cross,

[6514.76 --> 6518.76]  Love without end
[6518.76 --> 6525.30]  My hope was purchased by the blood of the man
[6525.30 --> 6531.30]  My Jesus, Redeemer

[6697.38 --> 6704.70]  Redeemer, my Jesus, gracious Redeemer and friend.
[6705.04 --> 6710.38]  There's nothing like years without end.
[6710.38 --> 6717.16]  My hope was purchased by the blood of the Lamb
[6717.16 --> 6722.96]  My Jesus, Redeemer
[6722.96 --> 6729.16]  My Jesus, Redeemer
[6740.38 --> 6765.38]  My Jesus, Redeemer
[6765.38 --> 6770.38]  In Christ alone my hope is found
[6770.38 --> 6775.38]  He is my light, my strength, my song
[6775.38 --> 6781.00]  This cornerstone, this solid ground
[6781.00 --> 6785.76]  Firm through the fiercest drought and storm
[6785.76 --> 6791.10]  What heights of love, what depths of peace
[6791.10 --> 6796.20]  When fears are still, when strivings cease
[6796.20 --> 6801.10]  My comforter, my all in all
[6801.78 --> 6806.10]  Here in the love of Christ I stand
[6806.10 --> 6822.12]  In Christ alone, who took on flesh
[6822.12 --> 6826.10]  Fullness of God in helpless pain
[6826.82 --> 6831.20]  This gift of love and righteousness
[6831.20 --> 6836.20]  Scored by the ones He came to save
[6837.02 --> 6842.20]  Till on that cross as Jesus died
[6842.20 --> 6846.20]  The wrath of God was satisfied
[6847.14 --> 6852.20]  For every sin on Him was laid
[6852.20 --> 6858.20]  Here in the death of Christ I live
[6858.20 --> 6873.20]  There in the ground His body laid
[6873.20 --> 6877.20]  Light of the world by darkness slain
[6877.20 --> 6884.20]  Then bursting forth in glorious death
[6884.20 --> 6888.20]  Out from the grave He rose again
[6888.20 --> 6893.20]  And as He stands He means to live
[6893.20 --> 6898.20]  His perfect voice is there for me
[6898.20 --> 6903.20]  For I am His and His God
[6903.20 --> 6908.20]  God in the precious blood of Christ
[6908.20 --> 6914.20]  No guilt in life, no fear in death
[6914.20 --> 6919.20]  This is the power of Christ
[6919.20 --> 6929.20]  In me
[6929.20 --> 6934.20]  From life's first try to final breath
[6934.20 --> 6938.20]  Jesus commands my destiny
[6938.20 --> 6939.20]  To me
[6939.20 --> 6944.20]  No power of hell, no scheme of man
[6944.20 --> 6945.20]  Can ever come from His hand
[6945.20 --> 6946.20]  Till He returns
[6946.20 --> 6950.20]  No power of hell, no scheme of man
[6950.20 --> 6951.20]  Till He returns
[6951.20 --> 6955.20]  Till He returns
[6955.20 --> 6965.20]  Or calls me home
[6965.20 --> 6966.20]  Till He returns
[6966.20 --> 6967.20]  Or calls me home
[6967.20 --> 6977.02]  Outlock me from his hand till he returns or calls me home.
[6977.02 --> 6983.02]  Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.
[6983.02 --> 7001.84]  Go now into this week with the blessing of God, with the strength of God, with the power of God.
[7002.22 --> 7009.18]  Regardless of what it is that you face in the days and weeks to come, God goes with you.
[7009.92 --> 7010.84]  Receive his blessing.
[7010.84 --> 7014.74]  God, go before you to lead you.
[7015.32 --> 7017.44]  God, go behind you to protect you.
[7017.80 --> 7019.82]  God, go beneath you to support you.
[7020.18 --> 7022.72]  God, go beside you to befriend you.
[7023.42 --> 7025.52]  Do not be afraid.
[7026.56 --> 7028.50]  Let the blessing of God come upon you today.
[7028.64 --> 7035.98]  Do not be afraid, but go in peace to love and serve the Lord.

[7040.84 --> 7067.60]  It's my only comfort in my life and in my death.
[7067.60 --> 7073.50]  You have fully paid for all my sins and all my death.
[7073.50 --> 7078.08]  Even when I struggle to believe.
[7080.08 --> 7083.18]  With your precious blood to protect me.
