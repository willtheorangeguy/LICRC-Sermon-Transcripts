• Paul's ministry as an apostle to the Gentiles, his hope for Israel's salvation, and their potential inclusion in God's plans
• The analogy of the olive tree, comparing believers (both Jewish and Gentile) to branches grafted onto the root of faith, emphasizing dependence on God's kindness and mercy
• The natural branches (Israel) were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, but the question is whether they can be grafted back in
• Paul answers that God did not reject His people, citing God's faithfulness to His promise and humanity's responsibility for rejecting Him
• Israel rejected Jesus as God's son, but God does not reject His people
• Paul gives three reasons why: 
  • Israel's unbelief is not total; there is always a remnant that will be revealed in the end
  • The chosen elect will always reveal themselves
  • God's choosing a people was never about physical descendants, but about His own faithfulness to His promise
• Israel's stumble was for the purpose of including Gentiles in God's plan
• Natural descendants are more readily grafted back into God's plan
• At some point, all of Israel will be saved

• God has a plan to bring about salvation through both Jews and Gentiles
• God's purposes in election

• The metaphor of the stone rejected by builders becoming the cornerstone (Jesus) is discussed
• Paul writes in 1 Corinthians that Jesus was a stumbling block for Jews and foolishness for Gentiles, but ultimately brought salvation to the Gentiles due to Israel's transgressions
• The term "Gentiles" refers to non-Jewish nations or people in the Bible
• Paul continues making his point in verse 12, stating that Israel's loss is riches for the Gentiles
• God's purpose in election was to include Gentiles in his salvation
• God's plan from the beginning included saving all nations, not just one
• The Bible promises a son who would undo the curse of sin and bring redemption
• This promise is applied to Jesus Christ as the ultimate ruler with no end
• God's plan for redemption involves filling the earth with knowledge of his glory
• God's plan for gathering people from every nation, tribe, and tongue is part of His original purpose.
• God has a plan from the beginning to the end, with a specific goal in mind.
• He is sovereign over the means and mechanisms of how events unfold.
• This is reflected in the Reformed tradition's understanding of sovereignty and election.
• The mechanism of Israel stumbling over Jesus as Messiah is part of God's sovereign plan of redemption.
• The mechanism by which the gospel spread to the whole world
• God's eternal purpose and the means of working it out in history
• Israel's rejection of Jesus at the time of Paul and its consequences
• The comfort of God's purposes in election, including the salvation of Gentiles
• The sovereignty of God and his plan for Israel's rejection as a mechanism to bring the gospel to Gentiles
• The church is spiritual Israel and the real descendants of Abraham
• God's sovereignty is active in the world through salvation and redemption
• Nations are blessed through Abraham, and the earth is filled with the knowledge and glory of the Lord
• The vision of Revelation involves every tribe, tongue, and nation singing holy songs to the Lamb who was slain
• The mission of God is accomplished through joining him in his purposes in election
• There is still hope for salvation for those who do not yet believe
• Paul's second point is that there is still a reason to have hope for the salvation of someone who doesn't yet believe.
• The Gentile inclusion will now become the mechanism of Israel being awakened to belief.
• Paul hopes his ministry among the Gentiles will somehow arouse his own people to envy and save some of them.
• Israel's rejection was previously used by God to bring salvation to the Gentiles, but now Paul hopes that the Gentile inclusion might be used to bring salvation to the Israelites who first rejected God in Jesus.
• Even their stumbling to believe can be used by God to bring life from spiritual death.
• God can use Israel's rejection of him as a means to bring them back
• God's sovereignty is demonstrated by his ability to turn rejection into acceptance
• God's sovereignty is not limited by human actions, including rejection
• Even outright rejection does not preclude God's purposes being fulfilled
• Personal rejection cannot overrule God's purposes in election
• God's rejection is not a guarantee of eternal separation
• Belief in God can be turned around from rejection
• The possibility that God will accept those who have rejected Him
• Prayer and pleading for God to intercede in the lives of others
• Preaching the gospel as a means of spreading God's message
• The potential for anyone to believe in God, regardless of past actions
• Branches broken off and grafted into the olive tree
• Not superior to others who are part of the same root
• Faith and life should not lead to cockiness or pride
• Christians should be humble and confident in Jesus, but not appear haughty or conceited
• Criticism of Christians for being judgmental or holier-than-thou suggests a lack of humility

• Avoiding selfish ambition and conceit, instead valuing others above oneself.
• Considering God's kindness and sternness, as mentioned in verse 22.
