[0.00 --> 2.00]  So alive
[7.00 --> 9.00]  So alive
[14.00 --> 16.00]  So alive
[30.00 --> 35.00]  If the stars are made to worship, so alive
[37.00 --> 42.00]  If the mountains bow, the reverence, so alive
[45.00 --> 50.00]  And if the oceans roar, your greatness, so will I
[52.00 --> 59.00]  For if everything exists to lift you high, so alive
[60.00 --> 65.00]  And if the wind goes away, send this so alive
[67.00 --> 72.00]  If the rocks cry out in silence, so alive
[75.00 --> 80.00]  If the sun of all our praises still falls shy
[80.00 --> 85.00]  And we'll sing a hundred billion times
[85.00 --> 88.00]  A hundred billion times
[88.00 --> 90.00]  A hundred billion times
[90.00 --> 92.00]  A hundred billion times
[93.00 --> 98.00]  Oh my god
[99.00 --> 102.00]  Oh my god
[106.00 --> 108.00]  God of Salvation
[108.00 --> 110.00]  Chased down my heart
[110.00 --> 114.64]  down my heart through all of my failure and pride
[114.64 --> 123.28]  I'm a hill you created
[123.28 --> 129.60]  the light of the world abandoned in darkness to die
[129.60 --> 136.64]  and as you speak
[136.64 --> 143.44]  a hundred billion failures disappeared
[143.44 --> 151.94]  where you lost your life so I could find it here
[151.94 --> 159.02]  and if you left the grave behind you so alive
[159.02 --> 165.86]  I could see your heart in everything you've done
[165.86 --> 174.50]  every part designed in a work of art called love
[174.50 --> 183.14]  if you gladly chose surrender so will I
[183.14 --> 188.66]  I could see your heart and feel you a different way
[188.66 --> 193.54]  every precious one
[193.54 --> 197.30]  a child you died to save
[197.30 --> 203.30]  if you gave your life to love them so alive
[203.30 --> 211.94]  like you would again a hundred billion times
[211.94 --> 226.58]  you're the one who never leaves the one behind
[226.58 --> 235.22]  what gift of grace is jesus my redeemer there is no more for heaven now to give
[235.22 --> 243.86]  what gift of grace is jesus my redeemer there is no more for heaven now to give
[243.86 --> 256.50]  what gift of grace is jesus my redeemer there is no more for heaven now to give
[256.50 --> 270.24]  what gift of grace is jesus my redeemer there is no more for heaven now to give
[270.24 --> 277.16]  To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus.
[277.94 --> 283.00]  For my life is wholly bound to His.
[284.66 --> 289.38]  Oh, how strange and divine I can see.
[289.72 --> 296.18]  All is mine, yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[300.24 --> 301.24]  Amen.
[330.24 --> 332.76]  His power is displayed.
[333.92 --> 340.40]  To this I hold, my shepherd will defend me.
[341.20 --> 346.28]  Through the deepest valley He will lead.
[348.06 --> 354.24]  Oh, the night has been won, and I shall overcome.
[354.24 --> 359.24]  Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[370.24 --> 376.46]  No fate I dread, I know I am forgiven.
[376.46 --> 382.96]  The future's sure, the price it has been paid.
[383.94 --> 389.88]  For Jesus bled and suffered for my pardon.
[390.80 --> 396.46]  And He was raised to overthrow the grave.
[396.46 --> 403.18]  To this I hold, my sin has been defeated.
[404.52 --> 409.54]  Jesus now and ever is my plea.
[411.36 --> 414.40]  Oh, the chains are released.
[414.72 --> 417.86]  I can sing, I am free.
[417.86 --> 423.04]  And not I, but through Christ in me.
[423.04 --> 439.84]  With every breath, I long to follow Jesus.
[440.68 --> 446.32]  For He has said that He will bring me home.
[446.32 --> 453.68]  And day by day, I know He will renew me.
[453.68 --> 459.70]  Until I stand with joy before the throne.
[460.66 --> 466.72]  To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus.
[467.92 --> 472.80]  Oh, the glory evermore to Him.
[472.80 --> 477.80]  When the grace is complete.
[477.80 --> 479.80]  When the grace is complete.
[479.80 --> 481.80]  When the grace is complete.
[481.80 --> 482.80]  Till my lips shall repeat.
[482.80 --> 485.80]  Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[485.80 --> 486.80]  When the grace is complete.
[486.80 --> 487.80]  Till my lips shall repeat.
[487.80 --> 488.80]  Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[488.80 --> 492.80]  To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus.
[492.80 --> 497.80]  But through Christ in me.
[497.80 --> 499.80]  When the grace is complete.
[499.80 --> 503.80]  When the grace is complete.
[503.80 --> 505.80]  Till my lips shall repeat.
[505.80 --> 508.80]  Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[508.80 --> 509.80]  When the grace is complete.
[509.80 --> 516.80]  Till my lips shall repeat.
[516.80 --> 521.80]  Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[521.80 --> 525.80]  Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[525.80 --> 529.80]  Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[529.80 --> 532.92]  but through Christ in me.
[534.46 --> 539.50]  Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[559.80 --> 571.20]  He's our rescuer. He's our rescuer.
[571.20 --> 575.86]  We are free from sin forevermore.
[575.86 --> 581.20]  Good morning. Welcome to church.
[581.20 --> 588.98]  As people are filing in yet, we're going to begin with a couple of announcements.
[589.80 --> 595.08]  This is just a reminder and an encouragement for some of you.
[595.08 --> 601.84]  For the women in our church on Tuesday, that's this coming Tuesday at 7 p.m.,
[601.84 --> 607.00]  there will be a bridal blessing slash wedding shower.
[607.00 --> 612.08]  I understand no gifts are necessary for Kristen and for Jane,
[612.08 --> 617.38]  two young women in our community who are getting married in a couple of weeks
[617.38 --> 620.54]  and a couple months, and so we want to bless them with that.
[620.54 --> 625.22]  And that's taking place at 7 o'clock, and that will be here at the church.
[625.22 --> 629.92]  So it will take place, whether permitting, in the courtyard or in the foyer as we're able.
[629.92 --> 633.10]  And so please, if you have any questions about that,
[633.10 --> 639.06]  there's some women around who will answer that and address that for you.
[639.06 --> 645.02]  As well, there's pastor's class after worship this morning for an hour,
[645.02 --> 649.22]  about 15 or 20 minutes after we conclude our time together.
[649.22 --> 651.50]  We will meet in the multi-purpose room.
[651.50 --> 655.46]  I encourage you to join us there if you've been participating in that class.
[655.46 --> 658.58]  If you have no idea what I'm talking about, you can grab me after the service,
[658.58 --> 661.62]  and we'll clarify that as well.
[661.62 --> 667.34]  And then the last announcement that I want to make is to say to all of you,
[667.34 --> 669.90]  Happy Father's Day.
[669.90 --> 675.26]  And we want to celebrate you and remember the fathers in our midst.
[675.26 --> 679.70]  We also today want to mourn with you if you are missing a father,
[679.70 --> 686.34]  or to enter into the hardship and the struggle if you are a father with a strained relationship,
[686.34 --> 690.38]  or a son or daughter with a strained relationship to your father.
[690.38 --> 695.86]  We remember the complexities of days like today in our midst as well.
[697.50 --> 702.78]  Lastly, we're doing worship just a little bit different this morning.
[703.90 --> 707.98]  And so as part of our experience of worship together,
[709.26 --> 713.50]  we are going to have a prayer team available in all sorts of different places.
[713.98 --> 719.26]  And so I'm going to invite the people that we have talked to about praying to come up to the front here,
[719.26 --> 723.02]  so that you can see them, and they will be available throughout.
[723.02 --> 729.10]  And then as they come up to the front, Sarah is going to explain how our worship will be a little different this morning.
[730.78 --> 736.54]  So you may have noticed that there's seven songs right off the bat, back to back, which is not our normal.
[736.54 --> 741.50]  But we will be following the ordinary progression of the elements of our service.
[741.50 --> 747.42]  We will be singing through our praise, our confession and assurance.
[747.42 --> 753.58]  And while we are doing that, these wonderful people will be around the sanctuary, in the foyer,
[754.94 --> 758.06]  and possibly out the side doors if they wander out there.
[759.10 --> 761.50]  Available for you to pray with you.
[761.50 --> 769.58]  If you have prayers of joy, if you have prayers of praise, prayers of sorrow and pain, anything in between,
[770.06 --> 774.94]  please, these wonderful people are available and willing to pray with you.
[775.98 --> 781.74]  If you see someone in the service that you want to take aside and pray with you,
[782.70 --> 787.90]  or if you see someone that you want to pray over, this is a great opportunity to do that as well.
[787.90 --> 792.70]  And so, take this time in prayer, in praise.
[792.70 --> 797.18]  It is seven songs, so if you need to sit, if you want to stand, if you need to kneel,
[797.66 --> 803.10]  however you want to come to God this morning, do as the Spirit leads you.
[806.94 --> 813.66]  As we were preparing for this service, we really wanted to give you opportunity to pray,
[814.22 --> 816.06]  and to focus in on our prayer.
[816.06 --> 826.06]  Singing is prayer put to song, and so happen and do that while you are up and around with these people,
[826.06 --> 827.10]  or in your seats.
[827.50 --> 830.84]  I'm going to invite these guys to come together a little bit in the middle.
[830.96 --> 836.06]  I'm going to begin by praying over you, and then we will send you to your places.
[837.34 --> 839.54]  Let's join our hearts together in prayer.
[839.54 --> 848.58]  Heavenly Father, we come to you at the beginning of this day of worship.
[849.54 --> 854.08]  And as we focus in on who you are and what you are doing in the world,
[854.42 --> 859.76]  we pray for these servants here who will lead and be led in prayer.
[859.76 --> 869.72]  Lead them by your Spirit, and help them to pray, Lord, in the utterances and groans of the Spirit
[869.72 --> 872.64]  as they connect with people here this morning.
[873.28 --> 878.76]  As we sing your praises, as we lift up our prayers, may you be glorified,
[878.76 --> 883.72]  and may our hearts be drawn ever closer to you.
[885.08 --> 893.38]  We send these now out to the corners of our sanctuary and into the foyer in the power of your Holy Spirit.
[894.58 --> 898.56]  Bless our worship this morning, we pray in Jesus' name.
[899.08 --> 901.20]  All God's people said, amen.
[901.20 --> 909.86]  As these guys are heading out to their various places, you can take note of where they are and who is available for you.
[910.30 --> 916.74]  I'm going to invite you also to stand as we receive God's greeting and gather in His presence today.
[922.30 --> 924.68]  Receive the greeting of our good God.
[924.68 --> 934.58]  Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, Son, and our Savior,
[935.10 --> 937.62]  through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[938.70 --> 939.14]  Amen.
[939.92 --> 943.26]  I invite you to turn to those around you and welcome them also in worship.
[954.68 --> 955.68]  Amen.
[971.76 --> 975.74]  O Church of God, is anyone among you in trouble?
[976.34 --> 977.14]  Let them pray.
[977.88 --> 978.94]  Is anyone happy?
[979.48 --> 981.18]  Let them sing songs of praise.
[981.78 --> 983.30]  Is anyone among you sick?
[983.30 --> 987.88]  let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name
[987.88 --> 992.92]  of the Lord. And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well. The Lord will raise
[992.92 --> 997.96]  them up. If they have sinned, they will be forgiven. Therefore, confess your sins to each
[997.96 --> 1002.90]  other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person
[1002.90 --> 1006.96]  is powerful and effective. Lift up your hearts and praise the Lord.
[1013.30 --> 1015.30]  Amen.
[1043.30 --> 1051.30]  Come and let your glory come and let your glory come.
[1053.30 --> 1061.02]  Our Father, who art in heaven, may the rocks cry out your name.
[1062.10 --> 1066.36]  Come and let your glory come and let your glory come.
[1066.36 --> 1079.36]  I will sing, sing a new song. I will sing, sing a new song. I will sing, sing a new song.
[1079.36 --> 1081.36]  I will sing, sing a new song to the Lord.
[1083.36 --> 1090.36]  Let your kingdom come and let your glory come. Father, the present is in heaven.
[1090.36 --> 1092.36]  In the name of Jesus' name.
[1092.36 --> 1097.36]  Let your joy come and let them come.
[1097.36 --> 1111.36]  Let me pray.
[1111.36 --> 1113.02]  Let me pray.
[1113.02 --> 1118.98]  In the name of Jesus, in the name of Jesus we pray
[1118.98 --> 1128.26]  And lead us from temptation, deliver us with your hand
[1128.26 --> 1133.80]  In the name of Jesus, in the name of Jesus we pray
[1133.80 --> 1147.62]  I will sing, sing a new song
[1147.62 --> 1149.62]  To the Lord
[1149.62 --> 1154.72]  Let your kingdom come, let your will be done
[1154.72 --> 1158.08]  On earth as it is in heaven
[1158.08 --> 1162.22]  Let the Lord proclaim the mercy of your name
[1162.22 --> 1190.72]  For the Lord
[1192.22 --> 1195.36]  Glory forever, Amen
[1195.36 --> 1199.42]  Let your will be done
[1199.42 --> 1203.00]  On earth as it is in heaven
[1203.00 --> 1205.26]  Every heart will claim
[1205.26 --> 1207.34]  Mercy of your name
[1207.34 --> 1210.94]  On earth as it is in heaven
[1210.94 --> 1213.02]  Let your kingdom come
[1213.02 --> 1214.98]  Let your will be done
[1214.98 --> 1218.36]  On earth as it is in heaven
[1218.36 --> 1220.42]  Every heart will claim
[1220.42 --> 1222.28]  Mercy of your name
[1222.28 --> 1225.96]  On earth as it is in heaven
[1250.42 --> 1252.42]  Let your will be done
[1252.42 --> 1254.42]  Amen
[1254.42 --> 1256.42]  Amen
[1256.42 --> 1258.42]  Amen
[1258.42 --> 1260.42]  Amen

[1268.42 --> 1270.42]  Amen
[1270.42 --> 1272.42]  Amen
[1272.42 --> 1274.42]  Amen
[1274.42 --> 1283.20]  It's the splendor of the King
[1283.20 --> 1287.76]  Clothed in majesty
[1287.76 --> 1292.06]  Let all the earth rejoice
[1292.06 --> 1295.66]  Let all the earth rejoice
[1295.66 --> 1301.54]  He loves himself in light
[1301.54 --> 1306.70]  In darkness tries to hide
[1306.70 --> 1310.02]  He trembles at his voice
[1310.02 --> 1313.76]  He trembles at his voice
[1313.76 --> 1318.96]  How great is our God
[1318.96 --> 1320.56]  Sing with me
[1320.56 --> 1324.88]  How great is our God
[1324.88 --> 1328.76]  In all who see how great

[1334.92 --> 1343.70]  From age to age he stands
[1343.70 --> 1347.76]  And time is in his hand
[1348.32 --> 1350.76]  Beginning at the end
[1351.30 --> 1353.76]  Beginning at the end
[1353.76 --> 1357.92]  With all that we are
[1357.92 --> 1364.76]  The Father, Spirit, Son

[1639.70 --> 1647.84]  Is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to God.
[1651.06 --> 1657.56]  With all creation I sing, praise to the King of kings.
[1657.56 --> 1664.60]  You are my everything, and I will adore you.
[1669.70 --> 1693.86]  Filled with wonder, awestruck wonder, at the mention of your name.
[1693.86 --> 1708.86]  Filled with wonder, awestruck wonder, at the mention of your name.
[1708.86 --> 1717.86]  Jesus, today is power, and the living water.
[1717.86 --> 1722.86]  At your promises to me.

[1784.86 --> 1792.86]  Then I saw a lamb, looking as if it had been slain, standing at the center of the throne,
[1792.86 --> 1796.86]  encircled by the four living creatures and the elders.
[1796.86 --> 1803.86]  The lamb had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits God sent out into all the earth.
[1803.86 --> 1809.86]  He went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who sat on the throne.
[1809.86 --> 1816.86]  And when he had taken it, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the lamb.
[1816.86 --> 1825.86]  Each one had a harp, and they were holding golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of God's people.
[1825.86 --> 1835.86]  And they sang a new song, saying, you are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals, because you were slain.
[1835.86 --> 1842.86]  And with your blood, you purchased for God persons from every tribe and language and people and nation.
[1842.86 --> 1851.86]  You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God, and they will reign on the earth.
[1851.86 --> 1857.86]  Then I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels, numbering thousands upon thousands,
[1857.86 --> 1864.86]  and ten thousand times ten thousand, they encircled the throne and the living creatures and the elders.
[1864.86 --> 1875.86]  In a loud voice, they were saying, worthy is the lamb who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and praise.
[1875.86 --> 1883.86]  Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea and all that is in them saying,
[1883.86 --> 1892.86]  To him who sits on the throne and to the lamb be praise and honor and glory and power forever and ever.
[1892.86 --> 1911.86]  Filled with wonder, awestruck wonder, at the mention of your name.

[3224.08 --> 3234.12]  For God so loved the world that He gave us, His one and only Son to save us, His heaven to be.
[3234.12 --> 3236.72]  He loved forever.
[3236.72 --> 3257.26]  For God so loved forever, live in our lives, His love, God so loved the world.
[3257.26 --> 3265.46]  Bring all your failures, bring all your addictions, come lay them down at the foot of the cross.
[3265.46 --> 3272.18]  Jesus is waiting, God so loved the world.
[3285.04 --> 3286.00]  Good morning.
[3288.36 --> 3290.80]  My name is Brenda and I'm a deacon here at Emanuel.
[3290.80 --> 3293.48]  We continue our worship with the giving of our gifts
[3293.48 --> 3297.42]  to the budget, which covers the administration of the church and its ministries.
[3297.90 --> 3302.50]  And our special offering this morning is for NAME, North America Indigenous Ministries.
[3303.32 --> 3308.54]  NAME is a multicultural team that exists to glorify God through building the church
[3308.54 --> 3312.40]  by making disciples among North American indigenous peoples.
[3312.78 --> 3317.28]  To reach the world for Christ, although the words evangelism and discipleship
[3317.28 --> 3318.92]  are not in their mission statement,
[3319.46 --> 3322.94]  making disciples is all about evangelism and discipleship.
[3322.94 --> 3325.32]  This is the bread and butter of who they are.
[3326.18 --> 3329.90]  NAME is committed to the growth and maturity of the First Nations Church,
[3330.30 --> 3333.94]  resulting in vibrant ministry to its community and beyond.
[3334.48 --> 3338.92]  With the desire to see strong, healthy First Nations Native American believers
[3338.92 --> 3342.04]  connected to strong, healthy local churches.
[3342.88 --> 3347.04]  In some areas, the local church will have a district First Nations identity.
[3347.58 --> 3350.60]  In other locations, the identity may be more multicultural.
[3350.60 --> 3355.74]  Equipping and supporting First Nations people to engage in ministry near and far
[3355.74 --> 3357.38]  is very important to them.
[3358.32 --> 3362.62]  Tim and Charity Johnson and family, who are supported by us at Emanuel,
[3363.28 --> 3367.12]  they desire to see Shushwap First Nations youth and young families
[3367.12 --> 3371.26]  grounded and strong in their identity and love for each other
[3371.26 --> 3373.26]  and their surrounding communities.
[3373.26 --> 3377.08]  With the knowledge and understanding of who the Creator is
[3377.08 --> 3379.50]  and the love He has for all people.
[3381.12 --> 3383.82]  2 Corinthians 9, verse 6 to 8.
[3384.22 --> 3387.28]  Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give,
[3387.56 --> 3389.36]  not reluctantly or under compulsion,
[3389.68 --> 3391.00]  for God loves a cheerful giver.
[3391.52 --> 3393.36]  And God is able to bless you abundantly,
[3393.56 --> 3395.56]  so that in all things, at all times,
[3395.94 --> 3396.96]  having all that you need,
[3396.96 --> 3398.70]  you will bound in every good work.
[3399.42 --> 3401.48]  Next week's offering is for Night Shift.
[3401.48 --> 3403.18]  Shushwap First Nations
[3405.26 --> 3429.80]  Wanna Rock
[3429.80 --> 3441.48]  I give you my life, I give you my trust, Jesus.
[3441.48 --> 3454.76]  And you are my love, and you are enough, Jesus.
[3454.76 --> 3461.56]  Jesus, Jesus.
[3463.70 --> 3471.08]  My heart is yours, my heart is yours.
[3471.48 --> 3477.92]  Take it all, take it all, my life in your hands.
[3477.92 --> 3484.80]  My heart is yours, my heart is yours.
[3485.10 --> 3491.84]  Take it all, take it all, my life in your hands.
[3494.04 --> 3499.70]  I give you my life, I give you my cross.
[3499.70 --> 3503.90]  Jesus.
[3506.14 --> 3512.88]  For you are my love, whatever life falls.
[3512.88 --> 3517.08]  Jesus.
[3519.32 --> 3520.08]  Jesus.
[3520.08 --> 3523.76]  Oh, Jesus.
[3523.76 --> 3524.76]  Jesus.
[3524.76 --> 3525.76]  Jesus.
[3525.76 --> 3526.76]  Jesus.
[3526.76 --> 3527.76]  Jesus.
[3527.76 --> 3528.76]  Jesus.
[3528.76 --> 3529.76]  Jesus.
[3529.76 --> 3531.30]  Oh, Jesus.
[3531.30 --> 3531.32]  Jesus.
[3534.76 --> 3535.76]  programmer
[3535.76 --> 3540.50]  take it all
[3541.12 --> 3545.52]  take it
[3547.14 --> 3551.54]  take it all
[3552.20 --> 3554.62]  take it all
[3554.62 --> 3561.70]  To Jesus I surrender all
[3561.70 --> 3566.50]  To Him I pray for
[3566.50 --> 3571.54]  Oh, I will never know
[3571.54 --> 3576.64]  And trust Him in His presence
[3576.64 --> 3581.48]  There is no love
[3581.48 --> 3588.08]  To Jesus I surrender all
[3588.08 --> 3592.52]  To Him I pray for
[3592.52 --> 3597.86]  Oh, I will never know
[3597.86 --> 3602.96]  And trust Him in His presence
[3602.96 --> 3610.90]  My heart is yours
[3610.90 --> 3614.34]  My heart is yours
[3614.34 --> 3617.74]  Take it all, take it all
[3617.74 --> 3620.94]  My life in Your hands
[3620.94 --> 3624.42]  My heart is yours
[3624.42 --> 3627.78]  My heart is yours
[3627.78 --> 3631.18]  Take it all, take it all
[3631.18 --> 3635.06]  My life in Your hands
[3635.06 --> 3639.12]  My heart is yours
[3639.12 --> 3645.06]  Take it all, take it all
[3645.06 --> 3647.56]  My life in Your hands
[3647.56 --> 3651.06]  My heart is yours
[3651.06 --> 3657.04]  Take it all, take it all
[3657.04 --> 3660.92]  My life in Your hands
[3660.92 --> 3664.98]  Take it all, take it all
[3664.98 --> 3666.98]  My life in Your hands
[3666.98 --> 3676.92]  My life in Your hands
[3676.92 --> 3678.92]  My life in Your hands
[3678.92 --> 3686.86]  I'd like to take a moment to invite all the kids to come up. If you are age three up to grade four, can come up and join us for a moment.
[3686.86 --> 3704.74]  You're five perfect. If you're five, you should come on up. Or six. I'm gonna show you something. So I'm gonna show you something that's gonna introduce us to what we're gonna talk about today in children's worship time. What do you think it might be?
[3704.74 --> 3722.62]  No, you can't guess you saw what it is. What might we be talking about in children's worship time? The fruits of the Spirit. That is such a good guess because we were talking about the fruits of the Spirit. And this time we're switching.
[3722.62 --> 3741.28]  We're gonna switch to something totally different. So it's like a surprise. Are you ready? I'm gonna show you what we're gonna talk about. Turn around.
[3741.28 --> 3749.42]  Mario. Mario. Yeah. Mario. Yeah. You guys all knew Mario is. There's some more people in Mario.
[3750.90 --> 3753.98]  Let's see if I can. How about this guy? Do we know who this is?
[3755.12 --> 3759.76]  Luigi. Yeah. Very important. And there's one more. My favorite guy in Mario.
[3761.34 --> 3765.64]  Yoshi. Yeah. And there's someone else in Mario who's really important.
[3766.44 --> 3770.06]  He's a really important guy. I didn't show you a picture of him. Who might that be?
[3771.28 --> 3772.70]  Emma?
[3775.10 --> 3781.22]  Princess Peach. Yeah. Princess Peach is really important because Mario and Luigi, they're trying to, what are they trying to do for Peach?
[3782.14 --> 3782.46]  Malachi?
[3785.74 --> 3791.42]  Right. Yeah. Sometimes, yeah. They're trying to save her. But why do they need to save her? They need to save her for a reason.
[3793.80 --> 3800.96]  They need to save her from Bowser. That's right. That's the other guy, Bowser. He's kind of like the enemy in Mario, right?
[3800.96 --> 3807.74]  He's Mario's enemy. And he's trying to make Mario's life a lot more difficult and stop him from rescuing Princess Peach.
[3808.48 --> 3814.46]  So in children's worship time today, we are going to talk about how there is an enemy of God, too,
[3815.00 --> 3819.60]  that we call Satan or the devil and how he tries to separate us from God.
[3819.60 --> 3826.34]  But we know that in the Bible, we learn in the book of Romans, chapter 8, that nothing can separate us from the love of God,
[3826.76 --> 3829.46]  even God's enemy, because God has already won.
[3830.98 --> 3833.84]  So that's our topic, our big idea for today.
[3834.22 --> 3838.24]  So we're going to, before we learn more about that, we're going to stand up and do our blessing,
[3838.62 --> 3841.18]  and then we'll head off to children's worship.
[3841.18 --> 3842.08]  See you here.
[3871.18 --> 3878.84]  We're going to continue in prayer together.
[3880.64 --> 3888.58]  Before we pray, just a couple notes or updates from some of the church family members that we have been praying about.
[3888.58 --> 3899.98]  Ellen White continues her stay at Delta Hospital, where she's recovering from a fractured patella
[3899.98 --> 3903.48]  and an ache in her chest and back because of a fall.
[3904.00 --> 3907.60]  That's pretty bad and pretty debilitating for her.
[3908.78 --> 3913.90]  She's having a really hard time there, and we are Ellen's people.
[3913.90 --> 3917.28]  In many respects, we are all she has.
[3917.58 --> 3926.04]  Her family is in San Francisco, and so a number of us have put a group together that are going out to visit her regularly.
[3926.60 --> 3932.74]  If you were moved to write her a card or something like that, there's a box on the wall for the office there.
[3933.16 --> 3934.44]  We encourage you to do that.
[3934.54 --> 3941.80]  Fill out a card, put it in the box, and then we'll make sure with the regular people who are going out to Delta to visit her that she gets that.
[3941.80 --> 3947.96]  Having visited her with my family, I know how much she appreciates that.
[3948.44 --> 3952.06]  Put that in front of you and lay that on your heart.
[3953.02 --> 3964.16]  As well, we are mourning, and in some respects, we are grateful to God with the DeVries family.
[3964.64 --> 3968.26]  Trudy DeVries' mom passed away on Friday morning.
[3968.26 --> 3973.70]  She was 97 and had been struggling for a long time.
[3974.18 --> 3979.36]  And so Trudy said that she is grateful that her mom now gets to see Jesus.
[3980.32 --> 3990.26]  And so we are with you and praying for you, but also wanted to share with everyone here that next Sunday on June 25th,
[3990.26 --> 3997.50]  there will be a celebration of life and a memorial for her at 2 p.m.
[3998.04 --> 4001.08]  So that will be here at church at 2 p.m. next week Sunday.
[4001.80 --> 4006.86]  Those details will be in the midweek memo this week as well, so you have that written there.
[4008.56 --> 4011.10]  Let's come to God in our continued prayer this morning.
[4011.10 --> 4025.14]  Holy God and Heavenly Father, we continue in prayer together today.
[4025.36 --> 4030.78]  We continue in prayer precisely because you are God.
[4031.26 --> 4036.10]  Precisely because we cry out to you, Abba, Father.
[4036.10 --> 4044.34]  And to you, our Heavenly Father, we come, even on this Father's Day, to give you praise,
[4045.02 --> 4054.60]  and to acknowledge who you are, and to proclaim to the darkness in the world and in our hearts the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[4054.60 --> 4061.50]  Humbly, we bow before your presence, worshiping your name,
[4061.60 --> 4068.30]  joining our voice with the angels and the elders and all who are in heaven and all of creation singing,
[4068.50 --> 4070.40]  Holy, Holy, Holy.
[4072.88 --> 4077.56]  In this place, Lord God, we come to lift you up.
[4077.68 --> 4083.18]  And we come, Lord God, that you might lift us up out of the pit.
[4083.18 --> 4086.52]  That you might save us from the grave.
[4086.62 --> 4090.52]  That you might restore us to the joy of your salvation.
[4093.88 --> 4096.42]  You're overflowing with your love.
[4098.32 --> 4105.34]  Fill us with your compassion for the world, and fill us with the power of your Holy Spirit.
[4105.34 --> 4115.40]  God, as we ask for your filling presence, we pray that you would be near to those whom we know and love.
[4116.50 --> 4120.64]  Be near to Ellen as she continues in the hospital.
[4120.90 --> 4125.14]  Give her all that she needs, and encourage her heart, Lord God.
[4125.22 --> 4129.50]  Help her to know your nearness and your presence.
[4129.50 --> 4134.04]  And help us, her church family, to minister that.
[4135.94 --> 4140.20]  Father God, we continue in prayer for those who are recovering.
[4140.62 --> 4148.92]  We continue in prayer for those who have received treatment and who are now on the path of convalescing,
[4149.02 --> 4150.58]  whether at home or in hospital.
[4150.58 --> 4152.76]  And so we pray, Lord God.
[4153.68 --> 4163.34]  We pray for the treatments and the journey of healing and wholeness for those, Lord God, who are struggling.
[4164.04 --> 4167.76]  We pray that you would be with Elise and give her all that she needs.
[4168.96 --> 4173.62]  We pray, Lord God, that you would be with Teenie and give her all that she needs.
[4173.62 --> 4180.20]  We pray that you would be with Mina as well and give her all that she needs too.
[4182.50 --> 4192.98]  Father, as we come before you, we come as those trusting in your healing hand, trusting in your power to restore,
[4193.20 --> 4195.70]  and so bring healing and restoration.
[4195.70 --> 4207.38]  God, we pray that you would be with Trudy and with the whole family as they mourn the loss of mother, grandma, great-grandma.
[4207.74 --> 4208.82]  They mourn Femi.
[4209.90 --> 4213.36]  We thank you, God, for her 97 years.
[4213.52 --> 4215.26]  We thank you for her faith.
[4215.68 --> 4221.38]  We thank you for the testimony from the family that she now is able to see you more clearly.
[4222.38 --> 4224.02]  And we praise your name for that.
[4225.70 --> 4229.76]  And still we miss those who pass from our presence.
[4231.28 --> 4236.86]  Even as we acknowledge that they have entered into yours more fully than we do here,
[4236.96 --> 4239.22]  they see more clearly than we do here.
[4240.82 --> 4246.42]  Their absence and our inability to see them is still hard.
[4247.32 --> 4250.46]  And so we ask, God, for your presence to sustain.
[4251.08 --> 4254.06]  Even as we walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
[4254.06 --> 4258.42]  may we fear no evil for you are with us,
[4259.02 --> 4261.42]  your rod and your staff to comfort us.
[4264.82 --> 4267.60]  God, during this season of life,
[4267.76 --> 4276.64]  we are also mindful that the school year is ending for elementary and middle and high school kids among us.
[4276.64 --> 4279.50]  And so we pray for that year to finish well.
[4280.70 --> 4287.60]  We know also that this coming week there are graduation ceremonies for a number of those present here.
[4287.72 --> 4292.10]  We pray that you would bless those events and bless those circumstances in life
[4292.10 --> 4300.48]  and bless those people who are beginning a new season of their young lives.
[4300.52 --> 4307.60]  Whether that's moving into high school after this summer or moving into college or university or into the workforce in some way,
[4307.74 --> 4311.28]  Lord God, we pray that you would be near to them
[4311.28 --> 4315.18]  and that they would acknowledge you both in their celebrations of this achievement
[4315.18 --> 4318.76]  and also in the days, weeks, months, and years to come.
[4320.20 --> 4325.66]  To that end, Father God, we pray as well for the young people who are in pastor's class right now,
[4325.78 --> 4328.66]  giving them the opportunity to discern their faith
[4328.66 --> 4331.28]  and to discern through asking questions.
[4331.28 --> 4335.14]  As we wonder together about professions of faith,
[4335.56 --> 4339.18]  we pray, Lord, that you would speak clearly to their hearts
[4339.18 --> 4342.08]  and that they would know who you are
[4342.08 --> 4345.32]  and would give themselves over to you in fullness.
[4347.58 --> 4350.12]  Holy Father, as we come now to your word,
[4350.22 --> 4353.54]  we pray that you would bless us in the hearing of it,
[4353.72 --> 4357.00]  bless us in the proclaiming of it,
[4357.00 --> 4360.88]  and send us out in the power of your spirit
[4360.88 --> 4365.12]  to live faithful lives as servants of Jesus Christ.
[4365.64 --> 4367.36]  It is in his name that we pray.
[4368.18 --> 4368.54]  Amen.
[4387.00 --> 4397.72]  We will continue with our reading and our work through Romans.
[4398.80 --> 4403.64]  We will read only two verses this morning, Romans 8.
[4404.22 --> 4407.56]  We're going to read verse 28 to 30.
[4408.58 --> 4410.06]  So three verses, I guess, technically.
[4412.72 --> 4414.90]  I clarified. I got it. Thanks, Aaron.
[4417.00 --> 4424.06]  All right, Romans 8.
[4424.68 --> 4428.06]  Let's read this together.
[4430.56 --> 4437.32]  We know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him,
[4437.90 --> 4440.36]  who have been called according to his purpose.
[4441.24 --> 4444.82]  For those God foreknew, he also predestined
[4444.82 --> 4447.28]  to be conformed to the image of his Son,
[4447.90 --> 4451.36]  that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters.
[4452.32 --> 4454.78]  And those he predestined, he also called.
[4455.56 --> 4457.92]  Those he called, he also justified.
[4458.58 --> 4462.18]  Those he justified, he also glorified.
[4463.14 --> 4464.40]  This is the word of the Lord.
[4464.40 --> 4476.28]  Very intentionally this morning,
[4476.46 --> 4481.36]  we have been practicing prayer together
[4481.36 --> 4484.82]  as part of our worship.
[4484.82 --> 4491.92]  One of the questions that people ask me all the time
[4491.92 --> 4495.70]  is, if God is sovereign,
[4496.28 --> 4498.20]  that is, if he is in control of everything,
[4498.38 --> 4499.70]  why should I pray?
[4500.98 --> 4503.16]  What's the point of prayer at all?
[4503.16 --> 4509.20]  And, connected to that,
[4509.42 --> 4512.48]  and grounding us further in Romans 8,
[4513.54 --> 4515.26]  what do we do,
[4515.36 --> 4516.78]  or what do we pray,
[4517.54 --> 4519.00]  when our words fail us?
[4520.74 --> 4522.48]  Right, when things are so troubled,
[4522.78 --> 4523.84]  or broken,
[4524.14 --> 4525.84]  that you don't even know what to pray.
[4527.36 --> 4529.36]  Now, in the section before our reading,
[4529.46 --> 4531.28]  we looked at it in detail last week,
[4531.28 --> 4532.48]  and I encourage you, if you weren't here,
[4532.54 --> 4534.14]  you can check that online.
[4534.84 --> 4536.00]  But in the section before,
[4536.40 --> 4537.76]  Paul writes, he says,
[4538.02 --> 4539.94]  we do not know what to pray for,
[4540.06 --> 4543.78]  but the Spirit himself intercedes for us
[4543.78 --> 4545.72]  through wordless groans.
[4548.06 --> 4550.88]  And so, the guttural groan
[4550.88 --> 4554.04]  is the prayer of a faithful mother
[4554.04 --> 4555.66]  whose child is in the hospital.
[4557.30 --> 4558.98]  The moan for mercy
[4558.98 --> 4561.52]  is the cry of a broken spirit
[4561.52 --> 4563.62]  who longs to feel whole
[4563.62 --> 4565.14]  and at home in their body.
[4566.56 --> 4569.48]  And the long exhale of exasperation
[4569.48 --> 4570.68]  is the friend
[4570.68 --> 4572.30]  at the end of her capacity
[4572.30 --> 4573.62]  to handle life.
[4576.28 --> 4580.22]  Those groans and moans
[4580.22 --> 4583.18]  and exasperated exhales,
[4583.44 --> 4585.40]  those turned into prayer,
[4585.88 --> 4587.56]  are what the Holy Spirit does.
[4588.98 --> 4590.42]  But,
[4590.90 --> 4592.92]  here's the thing,
[4593.60 --> 4596.16]  when you're in that moment,
[4597.54 --> 4598.94]  when that's all you have,
[4600.08 --> 4602.66]  it sure doesn't feel like
[4602.66 --> 4605.06]  the Spirit is at work.
[4606.92 --> 4607.74]  And so,
[4608.22 --> 4611.08]  when my hope
[4611.08 --> 4614.52]  doesn't match my feelings,
[4614.52 --> 4617.58]  how can I have confidence?
[4619.84 --> 4622.04]  What is the source of my joy
[4622.04 --> 4623.72]  and my confidence,
[4624.22 --> 4625.14]  even when,
[4625.24 --> 4627.30]  perhaps even especially when,
[4627.44 --> 4628.80]  you don't feel it
[4628.80 --> 4630.72]  or you can't see it
[4630.72 --> 4631.92]  in this life?
[4633.66 --> 4634.94]  That's the question
[4634.94 --> 4636.88]  I want to begin with
[4636.88 --> 4638.14]  this morning.
[4639.20 --> 4640.46]  When my feelings
[4640.46 --> 4641.98]  don't match my hope,
[4641.98 --> 4644.66]  how can I have confidence?
[4647.30 --> 4647.80]  Now,
[4647.84 --> 4649.04]  the answer to this question,
[4649.82 --> 4652.64]  the answer to this question
[4652.64 --> 4653.66]  is a truth
[4653.66 --> 4655.30]  of who God is
[4655.30 --> 4657.18]  and what God does
[4657.18 --> 4658.74]  because of who He is.
[4660.02 --> 4661.04]  And I know that
[4661.04 --> 4662.16]  for some of you,
[4662.26 --> 4663.40]  what I'm about to say
[4663.40 --> 4666.34]  is going to sound obvious.
[4666.34 --> 4668.38]  and I acknowledge that
[4668.38 --> 4670.24]  and yet,
[4670.68 --> 4672.20]  I want you to hear it
[4672.20 --> 4674.74]  and I want you to journey with me.
[4675.28 --> 4675.80]  Here it is.
[4677.44 --> 4679.72]  The truth of who God is
[4679.72 --> 4680.96]  and what He does
[4680.96 --> 4681.70]  in the world
[4681.70 --> 4684.28]  is not contingent upon
[4684.28 --> 4685.68]  us believing it
[4685.68 --> 4687.36]  or believing Him.
[4688.88 --> 4689.94]  Let me put it another way.
[4690.44 --> 4692.16]  It is not required
[4692.16 --> 4693.30]  that you feel
[4693.30 --> 4694.50]  God's presence
[4694.50 --> 4695.68]  or see
[4695.68 --> 4697.12]  God working
[4697.12 --> 4698.02]  for Him
[4698.02 --> 4699.38]  to be actually present
[4699.38 --> 4701.14]  and actually working.
[4702.54 --> 4703.46]  Let me illustrate
[4703.46 --> 4704.68]  what I mean
[4704.68 --> 4705.66]  and what's going on here.
[4706.48 --> 4707.18]  How many of you
[4707.18 --> 4708.08]  know the story
[4708.08 --> 4708.82]  of Peter Pan
[4708.82 --> 4711.20]  or if you grew up
[4711.20 --> 4711.80]  in the 90s,
[4711.84 --> 4712.30]  remember the movie
[4712.30 --> 4712.62]  Hook
[4712.62 --> 4713.68]  with Robin Williams,
[4713.94 --> 4714.96]  one of the best movies
[4714.96 --> 4715.48]  ever made?
[4717.02 --> 4717.22]  Now,
[4717.28 --> 4718.48]  in the original
[4718.48 --> 4719.64]  stage production
[4719.64 --> 4720.74]  of Peter Pan,
[4720.74 --> 4722.42]  there is a scene
[4722.42 --> 4723.50]  where Tinkerbell,
[4723.70 --> 4725.44]  who's the magic mini fairy,
[4725.90 --> 4726.94]  where she dies
[4726.94 --> 4729.32]  and the only thing
[4729.32 --> 4730.52]  that revives her
[4730.52 --> 4732.60]  is belief in her.
[4733.36 --> 4733.68]  Right?
[4733.72 --> 4734.98]  You have to really believe
[4734.98 --> 4735.96]  that she is alive
[4735.96 --> 4737.18]  and that she'll come back
[4737.18 --> 4738.04]  to life in the play.
[4738.92 --> 4739.50]  And so,
[4739.66 --> 4740.74]  it's an audience
[4740.74 --> 4741.84]  interactive moment
[4741.84 --> 4742.60]  in the play
[4742.60 --> 4744.48]  that when she's dying there,
[4744.58 --> 4745.24]  you're encouraged
[4745.24 --> 4745.92]  to clap
[4745.92 --> 4746.90]  and to cheer
[4746.90 --> 4748.18]  and to call out,
[4748.50 --> 4748.74]  Tink,
[4748.84 --> 4749.48]  come back!
[4749.48 --> 4751.36]  And the louder you get,
[4751.44 --> 4752.18]  the louder you get,
[4752.32 --> 4752.84]  finally,
[4753.32 --> 4754.48]  the actor on stage
[4754.48 --> 4754.78]  says,
[4754.88 --> 4755.04]  okay,
[4755.16 --> 4755.94]  you've reached enough
[4755.94 --> 4756.70]  of a fever pitch
[4756.70 --> 4758.16]  and Tink comes back.
[4760.24 --> 4760.72]  Now,
[4760.88 --> 4762.76]  it's a pretty raucous experience
[4762.76 --> 4763.84]  and it's pretty cool
[4763.84 --> 4764.54]  to see.
[4766.12 --> 4767.90]  Their belief in her
[4767.90 --> 4769.68]  brings her back.
[4772.16 --> 4772.32]  Now,
[4773.08 --> 4773.60]  psychologists
[4773.60 --> 4774.96]  and philosophers
[4774.96 --> 4776.56]  and theologians alike
[4776.56 --> 4777.88]  have taken this idea
[4777.88 --> 4779.46]  and they've made it,
[4779.68 --> 4780.44]  they've given a name
[4780.44 --> 4781.64]  to a concept by it.
[4781.90 --> 4782.38]  It's called
[4782.38 --> 4783.70]  the Tinkerbell effect.
[4785.28 --> 4787.12]  And the Tinkerbell effect
[4787.12 --> 4788.20]  is the idea
[4788.20 --> 4789.96]  that something exists
[4789.96 --> 4791.50]  only because
[4791.50 --> 4793.14]  people believe in it.
[4795.54 --> 4796.48]  Neil Gaiman,
[4797.16 --> 4799.30]  who's an American author,
[4799.42 --> 4800.80]  he plays with this idea
[4800.80 --> 4801.72]  in his book,
[4801.84 --> 4802.80]  American Gods.
[4802.80 --> 4804.88]  It's a fiction book
[4804.88 --> 4805.60]  that talks about
[4805.60 --> 4806.72]  how belief
[4806.72 --> 4808.04]  in the old gods,
[4808.38 --> 4809.54]  like Odin and Zeus
[4809.54 --> 4810.70]  and the different manifestations,
[4811.18 --> 4811.94]  is fading
[4811.94 --> 4813.46]  and so,
[4814.04 --> 4814.38]  therefore,
[4814.60 --> 4815.56]  is their power.
[4816.94 --> 4817.14]  Right?
[4817.18 --> 4817.80]  And it's fading
[4817.80 --> 4818.54]  because there's
[4818.54 --> 4819.76]  these new gods
[4819.76 --> 4820.72]  in Gaiman's book
[4820.72 --> 4821.60]  of technology
[4821.60 --> 4822.34]  and media
[4822.34 --> 4823.24]  and progress
[4823.24 --> 4824.18]  who are gaining
[4824.18 --> 4825.00]  more strength.
[4826.38 --> 4826.58]  Now,
[4826.68 --> 4828.36]  in Neil Gaiman's book,
[4828.48 --> 4829.26]  it's attention
[4829.26 --> 4830.50]  and time
[4830.50 --> 4831.66]  that are the metrics
[4831.66 --> 4832.56]  of belief.
[4833.52 --> 4833.76]  So,
[4833.84 --> 4834.58]  where you place
[4834.58 --> 4835.72]  your attention
[4835.72 --> 4836.66]  and to what
[4836.66 --> 4838.26]  we give our time
[4838.26 --> 4839.54]  is the expression
[4839.54 --> 4840.44]  of belief
[4840.44 --> 4841.32]  that literally
[4841.32 --> 4842.74]  creates a God
[4842.74 --> 4844.12]  in Gaiman's world.
[4846.00 --> 4846.42]  And so,
[4847.10 --> 4848.40]  when I say
[4848.40 --> 4850.18]  that the truth
[4850.18 --> 4851.58]  of who God is
[4851.58 --> 4853.02]  is not contingent
[4853.02 --> 4854.42]  upon our believing
[4854.42 --> 4855.02]  Him
[4855.02 --> 4856.84]  or believing in Him,
[4857.62 --> 4857.86]  right,
[4857.94 --> 4859.10]  most of us,
[4859.32 --> 4860.28]  at least here,
[4860.50 --> 4862.12]  know that that is true.
[4863.22 --> 4863.40]  Right?
[4863.44 --> 4864.00]  Most of us
[4864.00 --> 4865.08]  would profess,
[4865.32 --> 4865.82]  maybe we wouldn't
[4865.82 --> 4867.08]  use exactly these words,
[4867.22 --> 4868.24]  but that the God
[4868.24 --> 4868.80]  of the Bible
[4868.80 --> 4870.04]  is the only truly
[4870.04 --> 4871.46]  non-contingent being
[4871.46 --> 4872.26]  in the universe.
[4873.64 --> 4873.86]  Right?
[4873.94 --> 4874.46]  By Him
[4874.46 --> 4875.20]  and through Him
[4875.20 --> 4876.08]  and for Him
[4876.08 --> 4877.62]  all things are created.
[4877.80 --> 4878.38]  In Him
[4878.38 --> 4879.22]  all things
[4879.22 --> 4880.12]  hold together.
[4880.52 --> 4881.42]  Our being
[4881.42 --> 4882.86]  is only possible
[4882.86 --> 4884.34]  in His being
[4884.34 --> 4885.86]  or by His being.
[4886.18 --> 4886.86]  And in fact,
[4887.04 --> 4887.86]  we can go so far
[4887.86 --> 4888.20]  as to say
[4888.20 --> 4889.82]  that this is definitional
[4889.82 --> 4890.62]  to God
[4890.62 --> 4891.40]  being God.
[4892.72 --> 4892.96]  Right?
[4892.96 --> 4894.04]  For God to be
[4894.04 --> 4894.70]  God,
[4894.80 --> 4895.22]  Yahweh,
[4895.38 --> 4896.86]  I am who I am,
[4896.98 --> 4898.00]  this must be
[4898.00 --> 4898.96]  true of Him.
[4900.58 --> 4901.26]  And yet,
[4901.78 --> 4903.78]  when things
[4903.78 --> 4904.96]  get really hard,
[4906.24 --> 4907.06]  when we enter
[4907.06 --> 4908.88]  into sufferings
[4908.88 --> 4909.56]  and trial
[4909.56 --> 4910.44]  and struggles,
[4910.66 --> 4912.24]  we think about God
[4912.24 --> 4913.70]  more like Tinkerbell
[4913.70 --> 4915.46]  than we do
[4915.46 --> 4916.20]  the God of the Bible.
[4916.20 --> 4918.48]  here's what I mean.
[4919.58 --> 4920.78]  When our feelings
[4920.78 --> 4921.52]  about God
[4921.52 --> 4922.62]  or the lack
[4922.62 --> 4923.30]  of feelings
[4923.30 --> 4924.38]  about God
[4924.38 --> 4925.76]  determine
[4925.76 --> 4927.20]  whether or not
[4927.20 --> 4928.10]  we think God
[4928.10 --> 4928.86]  is present
[4928.86 --> 4929.86]  or doing something
[4929.86 --> 4931.10]  in our circumstances,
[4931.10 --> 4932.14]  we're thinking
[4932.14 --> 4932.70]  about God
[4932.70 --> 4933.32]  like Tinkerbell.
[4935.00 --> 4935.72]  And so,
[4935.82 --> 4936.20]  when people
[4936.20 --> 4937.54]  say things like,
[4938.12 --> 4939.10]  I can't accept
[4939.10 --> 4939.68]  a God
[4939.68 --> 4940.38]  who would let
[4940.38 --> 4941.00]  bad things
[4941.00 --> 4941.96]  happen to good people.
[4942.58 --> 4943.42]  Or when people
[4943.42 --> 4944.36]  say things like,
[4944.36 --> 4945.54]  if God didn't
[4945.54 --> 4946.38]  want me to be
[4946.38 --> 4946.98]  this way,
[4947.08 --> 4947.48]  He wouldn't
[4947.48 --> 4948.16]  have made me
[4948.16 --> 4948.74]  this way.
[4949.68 --> 4950.20]  Or,
[4950.40 --> 4951.78]  if God is real,
[4951.92 --> 4952.40]  He must have
[4952.40 --> 4953.18]  abandoned me
[4953.18 --> 4954.14]  or He hates me
[4954.14 --> 4954.96]  because I don't
[4954.96 --> 4955.48]  see Him,
[4955.56 --> 4956.64]  I don't hear Him,
[4956.76 --> 4957.80]  and I don't feel Him.
[4959.12 --> 4960.12]  We could go on and on.
[4960.20 --> 4961.02]  There are so many
[4961.02 --> 4961.88]  examples of how
[4961.88 --> 4962.90]  people today
[4962.90 --> 4963.98]  in this world,
[4964.30 --> 4965.26]  how even we
[4965.26 --> 4966.18]  sometimes,
[4966.52 --> 4966.74]  right,
[4967.04 --> 4969.54]  think and operate
[4969.54 --> 4970.28]  out of this way.
[4970.68 --> 4971.64]  I'm convinced,
[4971.82 --> 4972.10]  actually,
[4972.22 --> 4973.80]  that one of the reasons
[4973.80 --> 4974.80]  that so many
[4974.80 --> 4976.34]  people in
[4976.34 --> 4977.14]  today's world
[4977.14 --> 4977.82]  are leaving
[4977.82 --> 4978.60]  church or
[4978.60 --> 4979.46]  leaving Christianity
[4979.46 --> 4980.34]  that one of the
[4980.34 --> 4980.92]  reasons that
[4980.92 --> 4982.06]  the demographic
[4982.06 --> 4983.12]  category of
[4983.12 --> 4983.78]  nuns,
[4983.78 --> 4985.54]  N-O-N-E-S,
[4985.62 --> 4985.96]  that it's people
[4985.96 --> 4986.50]  who profess
[4986.50 --> 4987.48]  no religious
[4987.48 --> 4987.92]  belief,
[4988.34 --> 4989.08]  that that demographic
[4989.08 --> 4990.28]  category is climbing
[4990.28 --> 4991.64]  in the world
[4991.64 --> 4992.86]  today is because
[4992.86 --> 4994.30]  all they ever knew
[4994.30 --> 4995.36]  or all they ever
[4995.36 --> 4996.28]  thought about God
[4996.28 --> 4997.26]  was actually a
[4997.26 --> 4998.02]  Tinkerbell God
[4998.02 --> 4999.90]  or a Neil Gaiman
[4999.90 --> 5000.32]  God
[5000.32 --> 5001.80]  or a
[5001.80 --> 5002.30]  genie
[5002.30 --> 5002.84]  God.
[5003.80 --> 5004.66]  Right?
[5004.72 --> 5005.78]  And when belief
[5005.78 --> 5006.74]  in God
[5006.74 --> 5007.66]  is required
[5007.66 --> 5008.56]  for God
[5008.56 --> 5009.56]  to exist,
[5010.00 --> 5011.22]  all of a sudden,
[5011.36 --> 5012.08]  if you have doubts
[5012.08 --> 5012.90]  or if you have
[5012.90 --> 5013.48]  questions,
[5013.96 --> 5014.08]  right,
[5014.12 --> 5014.76]  these aren't just
[5014.76 --> 5015.98]  opportunities to grow.
[5016.36 --> 5017.08]  This becomes an
[5017.08 --> 5018.34]  existential crisis
[5018.34 --> 5020.36]  because God's not
[5020.36 --> 5020.84]  even real.
[5022.44 --> 5022.62]  Right?
[5022.66 --> 5023.66]  When your commitment
[5023.66 --> 5024.28]  to God
[5024.28 --> 5025.66]  is determined
[5025.66 --> 5026.72]  by what you give
[5026.72 --> 5027.74]  attention to
[5027.74 --> 5028.76]  or what you give
[5028.76 --> 5029.68]  your time to,
[5030.18 --> 5031.62]  you quickly find
[5031.62 --> 5033.00]  that the distractions
[5033.00 --> 5034.18]  and the things
[5034.18 --> 5034.88]  of this world
[5034.88 --> 5035.38]  have a really
[5035.38 --> 5036.40]  strong allure.
[5036.56 --> 5037.18]  They have a pull
[5037.18 --> 5037.82]  on your heart
[5037.82 --> 5038.98]  and that allure,
[5039.14 --> 5039.84]  no matter how many
[5039.84 --> 5041.20]  times it ultimately
[5041.20 --> 5041.82]  fails you,
[5041.88 --> 5042.64]  it still proves
[5042.64 --> 5043.34]  strong enough
[5043.34 --> 5044.08]  over and over
[5044.08 --> 5044.70]  and over again
[5044.70 --> 5045.26]  to pull your
[5045.26 --> 5045.94]  attention away,
[5046.20 --> 5046.98]  to pull your time
[5046.98 --> 5047.32]  away.
[5048.82 --> 5049.70]  And so you lose
[5049.70 --> 5051.42]  sight of the God
[5051.42 --> 5051.90]  of the Bible
[5051.90 --> 5053.28]  and then eventually
[5053.28 --> 5054.14]  you have no time
[5054.14 --> 5054.64]  for God.
[5055.00 --> 5055.48]  You have no time
[5055.48 --> 5056.00]  for church
[5056.00 --> 5056.70]  or for the Bible
[5056.70 --> 5058.24]  or for reading,
[5058.44 --> 5058.96]  for praying.
[5060.34 --> 5061.00]  And then lastly,
[5061.20 --> 5062.80]  if we approach God
[5062.80 --> 5063.94]  like a genie
[5063.94 --> 5064.70]  from the bottle
[5064.70 --> 5065.86]  where we ask Him
[5065.86 --> 5067.08]  our wishes,
[5067.22 --> 5068.24]  maybe we go through
[5068.24 --> 5069.34]  the right motions
[5069.34 --> 5070.14]  of being ready
[5070.14 --> 5070.76]  to ask Him
[5070.76 --> 5071.38]  or made ready
[5071.38 --> 5072.06]  to ask Him
[5072.06 --> 5073.06]  and then He
[5073.06 --> 5073.86]  doesn't give them
[5073.86 --> 5074.46]  to us.
[5074.94 --> 5075.52]  I mean,
[5075.56 --> 5076.12]  no matter how many
[5076.12 --> 5077.54]  times we watch
[5077.54 --> 5078.48]  Aladdin or see
[5078.48 --> 5079.20]  other movies
[5079.20 --> 5080.48]  with genies in it,
[5080.54 --> 5081.20]  there are modern
[5081.20 --> 5082.24]  parables that tell us
[5082.24 --> 5083.08]  that asking wishes
[5083.08 --> 5083.90]  is a complicated
[5083.90 --> 5085.26]  matter because your
[5085.26 --> 5085.88]  view is limited.
[5085.88 --> 5086.50]  You can't see
[5086.50 --> 5087.06]  the whole picture
[5087.06 --> 5087.66]  and so something
[5087.66 --> 5088.58]  always goes wrong.
[5088.80 --> 5089.48]  No matter how many
[5089.48 --> 5090.52]  times we see that,
[5090.86 --> 5091.62]  when our prayers
[5091.62 --> 5092.74]  don't go answered,
[5093.54 --> 5095.04]  we think either
[5095.04 --> 5096.60]  God didn't hear me,
[5097.42 --> 5098.52]  God didn't care,
[5099.26 --> 5100.30]  or God's not there.
[5102.94 --> 5104.02]  Now all of these
[5104.02 --> 5105.42]  modern approaches
[5105.42 --> 5106.54]  to God,
[5107.72 --> 5108.72]  and maybe you hear
[5108.72 --> 5109.22]  them from people
[5109.22 --> 5109.82]  who won't use
[5109.82 --> 5110.68]  the name God
[5110.68 --> 5111.74]  or the word God,
[5112.20 --> 5112.42]  right?
[5112.46 --> 5113.02]  Maybe you'll hear
[5113.02 --> 5113.82]  people talk about
[5113.82 --> 5114.58]  like putting it out
[5114.58 --> 5115.24]  in the universe.
[5115.88 --> 5116.14]  Right?
[5116.16 --> 5117.42]  Or asking the universe
[5117.42 --> 5118.62]  to give me something
[5118.62 --> 5119.12]  in return.
[5119.22 --> 5119.90]  Maybe they talk about
[5119.90 --> 5120.72]  some sort of ultimate
[5120.72 --> 5121.58]  reality.
[5122.08 --> 5123.30]  All of these approaches,
[5124.00 --> 5125.10]  to be clear,
[5125.18 --> 5125.92]  are fundamentally
[5125.92 --> 5127.74]  pagan or neo-pagan.
[5129.32 --> 5130.28]  They're not Christian,
[5130.38 --> 5130.80]  at least not
[5130.80 --> 5131.38]  Christianity
[5131.38 --> 5132.02]  or the Bible.
[5133.30 --> 5134.02]  These approaches
[5134.02 --> 5136.08]  are transactional.
[5137.04 --> 5138.02]  They're not worshipful.
[5139.16 --> 5139.88]  They're consumeristic,
[5140.98 --> 5142.28]  not submissive
[5142.28 --> 5143.78]  to who God is.
[5143.78 --> 5144.90]  And they're rooted
[5144.90 --> 5146.04]  in an idea of God
[5146.04 --> 5146.54]  that says,
[5146.86 --> 5148.10]  if God is real,
[5148.50 --> 5149.56]  His ways
[5149.56 --> 5150.82]  and His work
[5150.82 --> 5151.36]  in the world
[5151.36 --> 5152.60]  must be accessible
[5152.60 --> 5153.14]  to me.
[5154.54 --> 5154.76]  Right?
[5154.78 --> 5155.06]  They're rooted
[5155.06 --> 5155.48]  in an idea
[5155.48 --> 5155.78]  that says,
[5155.96 --> 5156.88]  if God is good,
[5156.94 --> 5158.02]  it must be in ways
[5158.02 --> 5159.02]  that I agree with.
[5160.14 --> 5161.12]  Or that if God
[5161.12 --> 5162.38]  is active in the world,
[5162.42 --> 5163.42]  it must be in ways
[5163.42 --> 5164.38]  known to me,
[5164.50 --> 5165.58]  ways that I can understand.
[5165.58 --> 5167.64]  And again,
[5169.34 --> 5170.90]  few of us
[5170.90 --> 5171.64]  here
[5171.64 --> 5173.00]  this morning
[5173.00 --> 5174.34]  would be so bold
[5174.34 --> 5175.58]  to put it that clearly.
[5176.94 --> 5177.94]  Few of us
[5177.94 --> 5179.16]  have the self-awareness
[5179.16 --> 5179.96]  to see
[5179.96 --> 5180.84]  that we're operating
[5180.84 --> 5181.94]  out of that kind of frame.
[5182.96 --> 5185.00]  But most all of us,
[5185.64 --> 5187.04]  myself first among us,
[5187.58 --> 5188.86]  have done it
[5188.86 --> 5189.64]  at one point or another.
[5189.64 --> 5191.74]  especially,
[5192.44 --> 5193.66]  especially when things
[5193.66 --> 5194.10]  are hard.
[5194.66 --> 5195.62]  Especially when we're
[5195.62 --> 5196.06]  in the midst
[5196.06 --> 5197.04]  of suffering.
[5198.84 --> 5199.42]  So instead,
[5200.14 --> 5200.92]  what does Paul
[5200.92 --> 5202.30]  want us to see
[5202.30 --> 5203.46]  and to know?
[5204.32 --> 5205.30]  Instead of a
[5205.30 --> 5206.56]  Tinkerbell approach
[5206.56 --> 5207.14]  to God,
[5207.36 --> 5208.32]  we are reminded
[5208.32 --> 5209.00]  and encouraged
[5209.00 --> 5210.60]  to see God's sovereignty
[5210.60 --> 5213.04]  in and over the world.
[5214.34 --> 5214.46]  Now,
[5214.56 --> 5214.90]  sovereignty,
[5215.04 --> 5215.36]  I get it.
[5215.38 --> 5215.86]  It's one of those
[5215.86 --> 5216.62]  church words,
[5216.70 --> 5216.94]  really,
[5217.18 --> 5218.06]  that you might not
[5218.06 --> 5219.04]  be familiar with.
[5219.04 --> 5220.34]  But in the word
[5220.34 --> 5220.88]  sovereignty,
[5221.22 --> 5221.78]  you might hear
[5221.78 --> 5222.32]  sovereign.
[5223.30 --> 5224.18]  Sovereign refers
[5224.18 --> 5225.12]  to a monarch
[5225.12 --> 5227.22]  and to royal rule.
[5228.02 --> 5228.76]  And so sovereignty
[5228.76 --> 5230.44]  is the exercise
[5230.44 --> 5231.58]  of the sovereign.
[5231.82 --> 5232.84]  It's the exercise
[5232.84 --> 5234.74]  of the royal rule.
[5235.44 --> 5236.06]  And so when you're
[5236.06 --> 5236.52]  talking about
[5236.52 --> 5237.66]  God's sovereignty,
[5238.36 --> 5239.36]  sovereignty is the
[5239.36 --> 5240.96]  exercise of God's
[5240.96 --> 5242.04]  royal rule.
[5242.20 --> 5243.26]  It is his will
[5243.26 --> 5244.32]  in the world.
[5244.58 --> 5245.68]  And God's will
[5245.68 --> 5246.82]  as sovereign
[5246.82 --> 5248.18]  rules the world
[5248.18 --> 5249.02]  and history
[5249.02 --> 5250.18]  from the greatest
[5250.18 --> 5251.46]  events right down
[5251.46 --> 5252.16]  to the least.
[5252.80 --> 5254.18]  God's will
[5254.18 --> 5254.94]  and rule
[5254.94 --> 5256.22]  upholds the universe
[5256.22 --> 5256.94]  from the most
[5256.94 --> 5258.30]  cosmic scope
[5258.30 --> 5259.68]  to the tiniest
[5259.68 --> 5260.84]  atomic detail.
[5262.44 --> 5264.40]  And right there,
[5265.40 --> 5266.68]  right there
[5266.68 --> 5268.86]  is your confidence.
[5269.82 --> 5270.58]  Right there
[5270.58 --> 5272.26]  is your hope.
[5273.02 --> 5273.44]  Right here
[5273.44 --> 5274.56]  is your hope
[5274.56 --> 5275.70]  in times of trial
[5275.70 --> 5277.16]  and suffering.
[5278.38 --> 5279.18]  Because if God
[5279.18 --> 5279.88]  is sovereign,
[5280.06 --> 5280.72]  and I believe
[5280.72 --> 5281.48]  that he is,
[5281.82 --> 5283.04]  if God is sovereign,
[5283.18 --> 5283.86]  then whatever you
[5283.86 --> 5284.84]  believe about him
[5284.84 --> 5285.42]  or don't,
[5285.96 --> 5286.84]  whatever you feel
[5286.84 --> 5287.58]  towards him
[5287.58 --> 5288.36]  or don't,
[5288.58 --> 5289.30]  whatever attention
[5289.30 --> 5289.88]  or time
[5289.88 --> 5290.46]  or worship
[5290.46 --> 5291.44]  you give him
[5291.44 --> 5292.22]  or don't,
[5292.50 --> 5293.46]  he doesn't need
[5293.46 --> 5294.48]  any of it
[5294.48 --> 5295.50]  for him
[5295.50 --> 5296.40]  to be
[5296.40 --> 5297.54]  for you.
[5298.38 --> 5299.44]  For him to be
[5299.44 --> 5300.86]  working on your behalf.
[5301.34 --> 5301.92]  For him to be
[5301.92 --> 5303.36]  guiding all of history
[5303.36 --> 5304.76]  to his ends,
[5305.12 --> 5305.86]  his glory
[5305.86 --> 5306.84]  and the glory
[5306.84 --> 5308.22]  revealed to us.
[5308.38 --> 5309.44]  That's the confidence
[5309.44 --> 5310.52]  of verse 28
[5310.52 --> 5311.92]  of Romans 8.
[5312.28 --> 5313.18]  We know
[5313.18 --> 5314.92]  that in all things
[5314.92 --> 5315.76]  God works
[5315.76 --> 5316.60]  for the good
[5316.60 --> 5317.44]  of those
[5317.44 --> 5318.72]  who love him,
[5319.32 --> 5320.24]  who have been called
[5320.24 --> 5321.82]  according to his purpose.
[5323.44 --> 5324.46]  I want us to see
[5324.46 --> 5325.22]  a couple things
[5325.22 --> 5326.44]  that we're going
[5326.44 --> 5327.20]  to zero in on.
[5327.84 --> 5328.40]  First,
[5329.40 --> 5331.08]  we know
[5331.08 --> 5333.64]  for Paul
[5333.64 --> 5334.78]  and for Christians,
[5335.34 --> 5336.42]  this is something
[5336.42 --> 5338.12]  we know.
[5339.32 --> 5339.50]  Now,
[5339.52 --> 5340.04]  in the Bible,
[5340.78 --> 5341.22]  belief
[5341.22 --> 5342.52]  and knowledge,
[5343.32 --> 5343.70]  faith
[5343.70 --> 5344.82]  and knowing
[5344.82 --> 5346.32]  are not
[5346.32 --> 5347.54]  put in opposition
[5347.54 --> 5348.30]  to each other.
[5349.42 --> 5350.80]  That's a modern invention.
[5351.66 --> 5351.78]  Right?
[5351.82 --> 5352.70]  The sort of dichotomy
[5352.70 --> 5353.18]  that exists
[5353.18 --> 5353.90]  between faith
[5353.90 --> 5354.90]  and science
[5354.90 --> 5356.06]  as ways of knowing
[5356.06 --> 5356.88]  in the world today
[5356.88 --> 5357.92]  does not exist
[5357.92 --> 5358.58]  in the Bible.
[5358.58 --> 5360.02]  And so,
[5360.30 --> 5360.62]  yes,
[5360.80 --> 5361.52]  by faith
[5361.52 --> 5362.58]  we believe.
[5362.72 --> 5362.80]  Right?
[5362.84 --> 5363.52]  We know
[5363.52 --> 5364.52]  that God works
[5364.52 --> 5365.16]  all things
[5365.16 --> 5365.86]  for good.
[5365.94 --> 5366.52]  All things.
[5367.42 --> 5368.46]  But the bigger point
[5368.46 --> 5369.32]  there is that
[5369.32 --> 5370.88]  you're believing
[5370.88 --> 5371.74]  that,
[5371.96 --> 5373.20]  you're knowing,
[5373.36 --> 5373.64]  right,
[5373.90 --> 5375.84]  that isn't required
[5375.84 --> 5377.86]  for it to be true.
[5379.14 --> 5380.18]  Does that make sense?
[5381.08 --> 5381.90]  Am I being clear
[5381.90 --> 5382.74]  on that?
[5382.80 --> 5382.92]  Right?
[5382.98 --> 5383.78]  You can know
[5383.78 --> 5384.46]  that it's true
[5384.46 --> 5385.24]  even when you don't
[5385.24 --> 5385.94]  believe it's true.
[5387.96 --> 5388.36]  Right?
[5388.38 --> 5388.94]  It's true
[5388.94 --> 5391.22]  because of who God is,
[5392.02 --> 5393.16]  not because of what
[5393.16 --> 5395.20]  you may or may not feel.
[5396.96 --> 5397.20]  Now,
[5398.06 --> 5403.20]  I need you to hear
[5403.20 --> 5406.34]  how immeasurably
[5406.34 --> 5407.14]  comforting
[5407.14 --> 5408.62]  that is.
[5410.68 --> 5410.88]  Right?
[5410.88 --> 5412.04]  The truth is
[5412.04 --> 5413.54]  that even
[5413.54 --> 5414.98]  when I cannot
[5414.98 --> 5415.86]  believe
[5415.86 --> 5417.26]  that God
[5417.26 --> 5417.90]  is with me,
[5418.16 --> 5418.84]  even when
[5418.84 --> 5419.62]  the darkness
[5419.62 --> 5421.26]  is so overwhelming
[5421.26 --> 5422.32]  I can't see
[5422.32 --> 5422.92]  anything else,
[5423.20 --> 5423.90]  even when
[5423.90 --> 5425.00]  the waves
[5425.00 --> 5425.70]  and the breakers
[5425.70 --> 5426.36]  are crashing
[5426.36 --> 5427.04]  over me,
[5427.38 --> 5427.98]  even when
[5427.98 --> 5429.42]  it is physically
[5429.42 --> 5430.50]  impossible
[5430.50 --> 5431.76]  for me to believe
[5431.76 --> 5433.04]  that God is here
[5433.04 --> 5433.62]  and that God
[5433.62 --> 5434.14]  is good,
[5434.44 --> 5435.54]  He is here
[5435.54 --> 5436.90]  and He is good.
[5436.90 --> 5440.58]  It is true
[5440.58 --> 5441.64]  no matter
[5441.64 --> 5442.56]  what
[5442.56 --> 5443.90]  is going on.
[5450.20 --> 5450.98]  Precisely
[5450.98 --> 5451.98]  when you can't
[5451.98 --> 5453.42]  see Him
[5453.42 --> 5455.74]  is when you need
[5455.74 --> 5456.46]  Him the most
[5456.46 --> 5458.40]  and you can
[5458.40 --> 5459.22]  know
[5459.22 --> 5460.50]  that He
[5460.50 --> 5461.72]  is
[5461.72 --> 5462.68]  there.
[5462.68 --> 5462.78]  There.
[5462.78 --> 5467.36]  Second,
[5468.14 --> 5468.88]  we know
[5468.88 --> 5469.60]  that in
[5469.60 --> 5470.92]  all things
[5470.92 --> 5472.00]  God works
[5472.00 --> 5472.64]  for the good
[5472.64 --> 5473.50]  of those
[5473.50 --> 5474.60]  who love Him.
[5474.72 --> 5475.78]  In all
[5475.78 --> 5476.54]  things.
[5477.36 --> 5477.54]  Now,
[5477.58 --> 5477.94]  I've said this
[5477.94 --> 5478.40]  before,
[5479.10 --> 5480.00]  but all things
[5480.00 --> 5480.90]  means
[5480.90 --> 5482.96]  all things.
[5484.26 --> 5484.44]  Right?
[5484.50 --> 5485.18]  Whatever your
[5485.18 --> 5486.18]  present sufferings
[5486.18 --> 5486.58]  are,
[5486.90 --> 5487.46]  whatever you're
[5487.46 --> 5487.90]  facing,
[5487.90 --> 5488.82]  even the very
[5488.82 --> 5489.70]  groaning of
[5489.70 --> 5490.26]  creation,
[5490.60 --> 5490.96]  whether it's
[5490.96 --> 5491.46]  persecution
[5491.46 --> 5492.30]  or pancreatic
[5492.30 --> 5492.66]  cancer,
[5492.78 --> 5493.32]  whether it's
[5493.32 --> 5493.80]  death or
[5493.80 --> 5494.16]  the death
[5494.16 --> 5494.46]  of a
[5494.46 --> 5494.96]  relationship,
[5495.40 --> 5496.38]  whatever it
[5496.38 --> 5496.76]  is,
[5496.92 --> 5497.44]  somehow,
[5497.80 --> 5498.42]  in some
[5498.42 --> 5498.76]  way,
[5499.06 --> 5499.66]  God will
[5499.66 --> 5500.22]  work it
[5500.22 --> 5500.80]  for your
[5500.80 --> 5501.74]  good and
[5501.74 --> 5502.36]  for His
[5502.36 --> 5502.82]  glory.
[5506.90 --> 5507.50]  Now,
[5507.54 --> 5508.06]  I wish I could
[5508.06 --> 5508.72]  stand here
[5508.72 --> 5509.78]  and tell you
[5509.78 --> 5510.62]  exactly how
[5510.62 --> 5511.82]  He will do
[5511.82 --> 5512.14]  that.
[5514.14 --> 5514.84]  But I
[5514.84 --> 5515.20]  can't.
[5516.74 --> 5517.56]  But I know
[5517.56 --> 5518.06]  that He will.
[5518.98 --> 5519.60]  And I know
[5519.60 --> 5520.30]  that He will
[5520.30 --> 5521.28]  because He
[5521.28 --> 5521.98]  did it
[5521.98 --> 5522.76]  with the
[5522.76 --> 5523.48]  death of
[5523.48 --> 5523.94]  Jesus.
[5524.52 --> 5525.32]  He did it
[5525.32 --> 5526.08]  with the
[5526.08 --> 5526.80]  death of
[5526.80 --> 5527.42]  His own
[5527.42 --> 5527.88]  Son,
[5528.22 --> 5528.86]  God Himself.
[5529.44 --> 5530.30]  God turned
[5530.30 --> 5530.88]  the death
[5530.88 --> 5531.40]  of God
[5531.40 --> 5532.28]  into the
[5532.28 --> 5532.66]  ultimate
[5532.66 --> 5533.16]  good.
[5533.82 --> 5533.96]  Right?
[5534.00 --> 5534.54]  The ultimate
[5534.54 --> 5535.20]  good,
[5535.30 --> 5535.92]  the saving
[5535.92 --> 5537.16]  of billions,
[5537.40 --> 5538.14]  the restoring
[5538.14 --> 5539.32]  of creation
[5539.32 --> 5539.74]  to His
[5539.74 --> 5540.48]  original plan
[5540.48 --> 5541.30]  and design.
[5541.58 --> 5542.04]  And if
[5542.04 --> 5542.98]  He can do
[5542.98 --> 5544.08]  that with
[5544.08 --> 5544.68]  the greatest
[5544.68 --> 5545.50]  evil the world
[5545.50 --> 5545.96]  has ever
[5545.96 --> 5546.46]  intended,
[5546.58 --> 5546.90]  the death
[5546.90 --> 5547.32]  of God
[5547.32 --> 5547.60]  Himself,
[5547.60 --> 5549.26]  surely He
[5549.26 --> 5549.82]  can do it
[5549.82 --> 5550.34]  with whatever
[5550.34 --> 5551.38]  it is you
[5551.38 --> 5551.72]  are in the
[5551.72 --> 5552.24]  middle of.
[5552.74 --> 5553.38]  Surely He
[5553.38 --> 5553.82]  can do it
[5553.82 --> 5554.22]  with whatever
[5554.22 --> 5555.28]  struggle you
[5555.28 --> 5556.82]  are facing.
[5559.10 --> 5559.74]  That's what
[5559.74 --> 5560.54]  it means for
[5560.54 --> 5561.96]  God to be
[5561.96 --> 5562.90]  sovereign.
[5565.90 --> 5566.56]  Third thing
[5566.56 --> 5567.14]  on this verse.
[5568.62 --> 5569.04]  We know that
[5569.04 --> 5569.64]  in all things
[5569.64 --> 5570.40]  God works
[5570.40 --> 5571.64]  for the good
[5571.64 --> 5572.94]  of those
[5572.94 --> 5573.92]  who love
[5573.92 --> 5574.12]  Him.
[5574.86 --> 5575.56]  For the good.
[5575.56 --> 5576.72]  What does
[5576.72 --> 5577.08]  that mean?
[5578.00 --> 5578.36]  What does
[5578.36 --> 5578.72]  that mean?
[5578.80 --> 5579.56]  Because for
[5579.56 --> 5580.04]  some of you
[5580.04 --> 5580.80]  right now
[5580.80 --> 5582.08]  it's awful
[5582.08 --> 5582.96]  hard to see
[5582.96 --> 5583.46]  how this
[5583.46 --> 5583.90]  thing or
[5583.90 --> 5584.46]  that thing
[5584.46 --> 5585.06]  or whatever
[5585.06 --> 5585.48]  it is
[5585.48 --> 5586.24]  can be
[5586.24 --> 5587.40]  for good.
[5590.70 --> 5591.40]  To be
[5591.40 --> 5591.70]  clear,
[5593.34 --> 5594.84]  I don't
[5594.84 --> 5596.02]  think that
[5596.02 --> 5596.84]  what good
[5596.84 --> 5598.08]  here is
[5598.08 --> 5598.40]  or what
[5598.40 --> 5599.14]  Paul means
[5599.14 --> 5599.74]  by good
[5599.74 --> 5600.56]  here is
[5600.56 --> 5601.62]  material
[5601.62 --> 5602.54]  things or
[5602.54 --> 5603.20]  even things
[5603.20 --> 5603.66]  that are
[5603.66 --> 5604.32]  necessarily
[5604.32 --> 5605.30]  available in
[5605.30 --> 5605.82]  this life.
[5607.30 --> 5607.66]  And so
[5607.66 --> 5608.42]  I don't
[5608.42 --> 5609.08]  think that
[5609.08 --> 5609.94]  Job is
[5609.94 --> 5610.30]  the right
[5610.30 --> 5610.92]  example to
[5610.92 --> 5611.26]  look to
[5611.26 --> 5611.52]  here.
[5612.38 --> 5612.80]  If you
[5612.80 --> 5613.14]  know the
[5613.14 --> 5613.70]  story of
[5613.70 --> 5614.08]  Job,
[5614.80 --> 5615.40]  he lost
[5615.40 --> 5615.90]  everything.
[5616.50 --> 5617.14]  He suffered
[5617.14 --> 5617.68]  disease,
[5617.96 --> 5618.32]  he suffered
[5618.32 --> 5618.78]  poverty,
[5618.92 --> 5619.46]  people around
[5619.46 --> 5620.04]  him died,
[5620.36 --> 5621.12]  he learned
[5621.12 --> 5622.04]  his humility
[5622.04 --> 5622.94]  before God
[5622.94 --> 5624.54]  and then
[5624.54 --> 5625.80]  his wealth
[5625.80 --> 5626.52]  was restored
[5626.52 --> 5626.92]  to him
[5626.92 --> 5627.98]  in greater
[5627.98 --> 5628.68]  measure than
[5628.68 --> 5629.08]  before.
[5630.56 --> 5631.46]  I don't
[5631.46 --> 5632.00]  think that's
[5632.00 --> 5632.34]  the right
[5632.34 --> 5633.04]  frame of
[5633.04 --> 5633.54]  reference or
[5633.54 --> 5633.86]  that's the
[5633.86 --> 5634.44]  right lens
[5634.44 --> 5635.14]  to view
[5635.14 --> 5635.62]  this through.
[5638.20 --> 5638.42]  And so
[5638.42 --> 5638.76]  if you're
[5638.76 --> 5640.28]  hoping that
[5640.28 --> 5641.48]  for whatever
[5641.48 --> 5642.48]  suffering or
[5642.48 --> 5643.20]  trial that you
[5643.20 --> 5643.70]  are facing
[5643.70 --> 5644.12]  right now,
[5644.14 --> 5644.44]  if you're
[5644.44 --> 5645.18]  hoping that
[5645.18 --> 5645.56]  it will
[5645.56 --> 5646.22]  yield a
[5646.22 --> 5646.56]  greater
[5646.56 --> 5647.36]  blessing from
[5647.36 --> 5648.00]  God in
[5648.00 --> 5648.66]  this life,
[5649.02 --> 5650.54]  I can't
[5650.54 --> 5650.98]  say that
[5650.98 --> 5651.34]  it will.
[5652.72 --> 5653.12]  Now I
[5653.12 --> 5653.48]  pray that
[5653.48 --> 5653.94]  it does,
[5654.84 --> 5655.08]  right?
[5655.18 --> 5656.02]  I want
[5656.02 --> 5656.56]  that for
[5656.56 --> 5656.84]  you,
[5657.48 --> 5658.82]  but it's
[5658.82 --> 5659.10]  not the
[5659.10 --> 5659.56]  promise of
[5659.56 --> 5659.80]  God.
[5659.80 --> 5662.54]  instead,
[5663.54 --> 5664.92]  I think
[5664.92 --> 5665.64]  the connection
[5665.64 --> 5666.56]  is between
[5666.56 --> 5667.70]  good in
[5667.70 --> 5668.32]  verse 28
[5668.32 --> 5669.56]  and the
[5669.56 --> 5670.14]  next line,
[5670.32 --> 5671.34]  being called
[5671.34 --> 5672.08]  according to
[5672.08 --> 5672.72]  his purpose.
[5674.00 --> 5674.42]  And I
[5674.42 --> 5674.74]  think that
[5674.74 --> 5675.26]  the purpose
[5675.26 --> 5675.68]  of his
[5675.68 --> 5676.70]  calling is
[5676.70 --> 5677.06]  written out
[5677.06 --> 5677.52]  for us in
[5677.52 --> 5678.18]  verse 29.
[5678.30 --> 5678.50]  So with
[5678.50 --> 5678.86]  your Bibles
[5678.86 --> 5679.20]  open,
[5679.68 --> 5679.86]  right?
[5679.96 --> 5680.44]  For those
[5680.44 --> 5681.26]  God foreknew,
[5681.42 --> 5681.88]  he also
[5681.88 --> 5682.82]  predestined to
[5682.82 --> 5683.06]  what?
[5683.16 --> 5683.70]  To be
[5683.70 --> 5685.10]  conformed to
[5685.10 --> 5685.86]  the image
[5685.86 --> 5687.26]  of his
[5687.26 --> 5688.88]  Son.
[5689.80 --> 5692.70]  the good
[5692.70 --> 5693.88]  that comes
[5693.88 --> 5694.62]  from all
[5694.62 --> 5695.96]  things being
[5695.96 --> 5696.56]  turned,
[5696.98 --> 5697.12]  right?
[5697.16 --> 5697.78]  The good
[5697.78 --> 5698.46]  that God
[5698.46 --> 5698.94]  brings,
[5699.10 --> 5699.86]  the purpose
[5699.86 --> 5700.74]  of your
[5700.74 --> 5701.46]  calling,
[5701.80 --> 5702.04]  right,
[5702.10 --> 5702.72]  to face
[5702.72 --> 5703.84]  these present
[5703.84 --> 5704.46]  sufferings,
[5704.54 --> 5705.00]  whatever they
[5705.00 --> 5705.56]  may be,
[5705.84 --> 5706.48]  is so that
[5706.48 --> 5707.12]  you might
[5707.12 --> 5708.20]  be conformed,
[5708.24 --> 5708.60]  is so that
[5708.60 --> 5709.06]  you might
[5709.06 --> 5709.92]  be transformed
[5709.92 --> 5710.96]  into the
[5710.96 --> 5711.62]  image of
[5711.62 --> 5712.28]  Jesus.
[5712.58 --> 5713.54]  Your good
[5713.54 --> 5714.40]  is to be
[5714.40 --> 5715.14]  made like
[5715.14 --> 5715.62]  Jesus.
[5717.12 --> 5717.72]  That's the
[5717.72 --> 5718.28]  journey of
[5718.28 --> 5719.14]  life and
[5719.14 --> 5719.58]  faith.
[5719.80 --> 5720.48]  That's the
[5720.48 --> 5721.10]  path of
[5721.10 --> 5721.64]  being a
[5721.64 --> 5721.94]  Christian.
[5722.26 --> 5722.56]  It is to
[5722.56 --> 5723.22]  be transformed
[5723.22 --> 5723.98]  into the
[5723.98 --> 5724.74]  image of
[5724.74 --> 5725.04]  Jesus.
[5725.20 --> 5725.48]  It is to
[5725.48 --> 5725.98]  be made
[5725.98 --> 5726.80]  like him.
[5727.08 --> 5727.46]  And all
[5727.46 --> 5728.06]  throughout the
[5728.06 --> 5728.42]  scriptures,
[5728.96 --> 5729.50]  this is
[5729.50 --> 5730.24]  made clear.
[5731.04 --> 5731.32]  I'm going
[5731.32 --> 5731.54]  to run
[5731.54 --> 5731.84]  through a
[5731.84 --> 5732.24]  bunch of
[5732.24 --> 5733.14]  texts here,
[5733.24 --> 5733.60]  but just
[5733.60 --> 5734.18]  bear with
[5734.18 --> 5734.42]  me.
[5735.38 --> 5736.18]  2 Corinthians
[5736.18 --> 5736.70]  5,
[5736.80 --> 5737.32]  17.
[5738.48 --> 5738.78]  Therefore,
[5739.06 --> 5739.44]  if anyone
[5739.44 --> 5740.90]  is in
[5740.90 --> 5741.28]  Christ,
[5741.42 --> 5741.74]  the new
[5741.74 --> 5742.18]  creation
[5742.18 --> 5742.72]  has come,
[5742.98 --> 5743.50]  the old
[5743.50 --> 5744.04]  is gone,
[5744.12 --> 5744.44]  the new
[5744.44 --> 5744.92]  is here.
[5745.72 --> 5746.24]  Philippians
[5746.24 --> 5746.58]  3,
[5746.70 --> 5747.20]  21.
[5747.20 --> 5748.92]  Jesus
[5748.92 --> 5749.52]  Christ,
[5749.64 --> 5749.84]  who,
[5750.00 --> 5750.26]  by the
[5750.26 --> 5750.86]  power that
[5750.86 --> 5751.54]  enabled him
[5751.54 --> 5752.24]  to bring
[5752.24 --> 5753.02]  everything under
[5753.02 --> 5753.72]  his control,
[5753.90 --> 5754.76]  will transform
[5754.76 --> 5755.98]  our lowly
[5755.98 --> 5756.78]  bodies so that
[5756.78 --> 5757.44]  they will be
[5757.44 --> 5758.18]  like his
[5758.18 --> 5759.40]  glorious body.
[5760.08 --> 5760.94]  1 Corinthians
[5760.94 --> 5762.14]  15, 49,
[5762.14 --> 5762.68]  and just
[5762.68 --> 5763.12]  as we
[5763.12 --> 5763.52]  have been
[5763.52 --> 5764.06]  born in
[5764.06 --> 5764.48]  the image
[5764.48 --> 5765.04]  of earthly
[5765.04 --> 5765.50]  man,
[5765.78 --> 5766.52]  so shall
[5766.52 --> 5767.10]  we bear
[5767.10 --> 5767.80]  the image
[5767.80 --> 5768.38]  of the
[5768.38 --> 5768.82]  heavenly
[5768.82 --> 5769.76]  man.
[5770.72 --> 5771.36]  1 John
[5771.36 --> 5772.14]  3, 2.
[5772.60 --> 5772.78]  Dear
[5772.78 --> 5773.28]  friends,
[5773.46 --> 5773.92]  now we
[5773.92 --> 5774.34]  are children
[5774.34 --> 5774.90]  of God,
[5775.00 --> 5775.44]  and what
[5775.44 --> 5776.30]  will be
[5776.30 --> 5776.82]  has not
[5776.82 --> 5777.24]  yet been
[5777.24 --> 5777.76]  made known,
[5777.88 --> 5778.16]  but we
[5778.16 --> 5778.68]  know that
[5778.68 --> 5779.26]  when Christ
[5779.26 --> 5779.78]  appears,
[5779.98 --> 5780.50]  we shall
[5780.50 --> 5781.14]  be like
[5781.14 --> 5781.56]  him,
[5781.98 --> 5782.44]  for we
[5782.44 --> 5783.00]  shall see
[5783.00 --> 5784.12]  him as
[5784.12 --> 5785.40]  he is.
[5785.46 --> 5785.74]  And then
[5785.74 --> 5786.20]  lastly,
[5786.36 --> 5786.68]  although we
[5786.68 --> 5787.04]  could keep
[5787.04 --> 5787.38]  going,
[5787.52 --> 5788.18]  2 Corinthians
[5788.18 --> 5789.50]  3, 18.
[5789.50 --> 5790.20]  And we
[5790.20 --> 5790.78]  all,
[5791.06 --> 5791.68]  who with
[5791.68 --> 5792.36]  unveiled
[5792.36 --> 5792.96]  faces
[5792.96 --> 5793.76]  contemplate
[5793.76 --> 5794.22]  the Lord's
[5794.22 --> 5794.52]  glory,
[5794.78 --> 5795.34]  are being
[5795.34 --> 5796.08]  transformed
[5796.08 --> 5797.58]  into his
[5797.58 --> 5798.48]  image with
[5798.48 --> 5799.78]  ever-increasing
[5799.78 --> 5801.02]  glory which
[5801.02 --> 5802.00]  comes from
[5802.00 --> 5802.52]  the Lord
[5802.52 --> 5803.26]  who is
[5803.26 --> 5804.24]  the Spirit.
[5805.02 --> 5806.32]  This is
[5806.32 --> 5807.12]  the journey
[5807.12 --> 5808.60]  of faith.
[5808.76 --> 5809.36]  This is
[5809.36 --> 5809.94]  the path
[5809.94 --> 5810.78]  that God
[5810.78 --> 5811.44]  puts us
[5811.44 --> 5812.18]  on to be
[5812.18 --> 5812.66]  transformed
[5812.66 --> 5813.38]  like his
[5813.38 --> 5813.74]  Son,
[5814.06 --> 5814.36]  to be
[5814.36 --> 5815.10]  glorified.
[5816.28 --> 5816.66]  Now this
[5816.66 --> 5817.58]  section of
[5817.58 --> 5818.02]  text that
[5818.02 --> 5818.32]  we read
[5818.32 --> 5819.30]  in Romans
[5819.30 --> 5820.70]  8 begins
[5820.70 --> 5821.06]  with the
[5821.06 --> 5821.40]  line,
[5821.86 --> 5822.54]  I consider
[5822.54 --> 5822.98]  that our
[5822.98 --> 5823.34]  present
[5823.34 --> 5823.98]  sufferings,
[5824.00 --> 5824.28]  this is
[5824.28 --> 5824.92]  verse 18,
[5825.10 --> 5825.48]  are not
[5825.48 --> 5826.26]  worth comparing
[5826.26 --> 5826.78]  with the
[5826.78 --> 5827.98]  glory that
[5827.98 --> 5828.40]  will be
[5828.40 --> 5829.80]  revealed in
[5829.80 --> 5830.08]  us.
[5830.14 --> 5830.38]  And then
[5830.38 --> 5831.02]  this immediate
[5831.02 --> 5832.10]  section ends
[5832.10 --> 5833.18]  with the
[5833.18 --> 5833.82]  line,
[5833.92 --> 5834.18]  with it
[5834.18 --> 5834.90]  mapped out
[5834.90 --> 5835.50]  for us,
[5835.56 --> 5836.18]  this journey
[5836.18 --> 5836.70]  in verse
[5836.70 --> 5837.28]  29,
[5837.80 --> 5838.20]  that those
[5838.20 --> 5838.98]  God foreknew,
[5839.16 --> 5839.92]  he predestined
[5839.92 --> 5840.24]  to be
[5840.24 --> 5841.00]  conformed into
[5841.00 --> 5841.54]  the image
[5841.54 --> 5841.92]  of his
[5841.92 --> 5842.20]  Son.
[5842.38 --> 5842.82]  Those he
[5842.82 --> 5843.52]  predestined,
[5843.68 --> 5844.22]  he also
[5844.22 --> 5844.66]  called.
[5844.78 --> 5845.08]  Those he
[5845.08 --> 5845.44]  called,
[5845.54 --> 5845.88]  he also
[5845.88 --> 5846.40]  justified.
[5846.86 --> 5847.26]  Those he
[5847.26 --> 5847.84]  justified,
[5848.20 --> 5848.82]  he also
[5848.82 --> 5850.26]  glorified.
[5851.66 --> 5852.26]  This,
[5852.50 --> 5852.70]  then,
[5852.76 --> 5853.40]  is God's
[5853.40 --> 5854.80]  promise for
[5854.80 --> 5855.34]  you today,
[5856.18 --> 5857.02]  that by his
[5857.02 --> 5857.44]  grace,
[5857.82 --> 5858.32]  before the
[5858.32 --> 5859.38]  foundation of
[5859.38 --> 5859.98]  the world,
[5860.32 --> 5860.96]  before you
[5860.96 --> 5861.54]  were formed
[5861.54 --> 5861.92]  in your
[5861.92 --> 5862.74]  mother's
[5862.74 --> 5863.02]  womb,
[5863.28 --> 5863.86]  he knew
[5863.86 --> 5864.78]  you by
[5864.78 --> 5865.46]  name.
[5867.28 --> 5867.68]  And it's
[5867.68 --> 5868.22]  not enough
[5868.22 --> 5868.58]  for this
[5868.58 --> 5869.00]  God just
[5869.00 --> 5869.78]  to know
[5869.78 --> 5870.14]  you,
[5870.80 --> 5870.96]  right?
[5871.00 --> 5871.68]  His knowledge
[5871.68 --> 5872.40]  of you
[5872.40 --> 5873.26]  moved him
[5873.26 --> 5874.64]  to predestine
[5874.64 --> 5874.94]  you.
[5875.18 --> 5875.64]  Now I get
[5875.64 --> 5875.82]  it,
[5875.82 --> 5876.78]  that is
[5876.78 --> 5877.24]  a loaded
[5877.24 --> 5878.00]  term for
[5878.00 --> 5878.20]  many
[5878.20 --> 5878.56]  people.
[5880.50 --> 5881.44]  But it's
[5881.44 --> 5881.98]  a necessary
[5881.98 --> 5882.60]  term.
[5884.58 --> 5885.64]  It is a
[5885.64 --> 5886.20]  necessary
[5886.20 --> 5887.86]  action of
[5887.86 --> 5888.20]  God.
[5889.08 --> 5889.46]  To be
[5889.46 --> 5890.18]  predestined
[5890.18 --> 5890.78]  means that
[5890.78 --> 5891.58]  God takes
[5891.58 --> 5892.92]  you from
[5892.92 --> 5894.32]  death to
[5894.32 --> 5894.76]  life.
[5895.40 --> 5895.84]  It means
[5895.84 --> 5896.16]  that God
[5896.16 --> 5896.72]  has called
[5896.72 --> 5897.54]  you with
[5897.54 --> 5898.30]  his unconditional
[5898.30 --> 5898.92]  love and
[5898.92 --> 5899.70]  has transformed
[5899.70 --> 5900.04]  you,
[5900.34 --> 5900.78]  taking you
[5900.78 --> 5901.22]  out of
[5901.22 --> 5902.14]  darkness and
[5902.14 --> 5902.66]  bringing you
[5902.66 --> 5903.22]  into light.
[5903.22 --> 5903.90]  for God
[5903.90 --> 5904.94]  to predestine
[5904.94 --> 5905.80]  is required
[5905.80 --> 5906.88]  because we
[5906.88 --> 5907.52]  are dead
[5907.52 --> 5907.86]  in our
[5907.86 --> 5908.52]  transgressions
[5908.52 --> 5908.94]  and sins.
[5909.06 --> 5909.86]  That's earlier
[5909.86 --> 5910.40]  in Romans.
[5910.46 --> 5910.94]  We spent a lot
[5910.94 --> 5911.24]  of time
[5911.24 --> 5911.46]  there.
[5913.40 --> 5913.78]  And let me
[5913.78 --> 5914.30]  ask you,
[5914.86 --> 5916.44]  what can a
[5916.44 --> 5916.98]  dead person
[5916.98 --> 5917.26]  do?
[5920.62 --> 5921.10]  Nothing.
[5922.62 --> 5923.28]  That's the
[5923.28 --> 5923.64]  point.
[5924.90 --> 5925.12]  Right?
[5925.16 --> 5925.56]  There is no
[5925.56 --> 5926.32]  belief that
[5926.32 --> 5926.86]  will raise
[5926.86 --> 5927.14]  you.
[5927.80 --> 5928.48]  There is no
[5928.48 --> 5929.82]  crowd that
[5929.82 --> 5930.32]  will clap
[5930.32 --> 5931.20]  you back
[5931.20 --> 5932.36]  into life.
[5932.36 --> 5933.56]  The only
[5933.56 --> 5934.04]  thing,
[5934.32 --> 5934.70]  the only
[5934.70 --> 5935.26]  one that
[5935.26 --> 5935.56]  can do
[5935.56 --> 5935.96]  it is the
[5935.96 --> 5936.60]  work and
[5936.60 --> 5937.02]  the will
[5937.02 --> 5937.72]  of God.
[5939.00 --> 5939.48]  And those
[5939.48 --> 5940.18]  God foreknew
[5940.18 --> 5941.28]  he also
[5941.28 --> 5942.34]  predestined.
[5942.42 --> 5942.68]  And those
[5942.68 --> 5943.50]  he predestined
[5943.50 --> 5944.02]  he also
[5944.02 --> 5944.76]  called.
[5944.90 --> 5945.42]  The call
[5945.42 --> 5945.96]  of God,
[5946.20 --> 5946.58]  brothers and
[5946.58 --> 5946.82]  sisters,
[5946.92 --> 5947.18]  is the
[5947.18 --> 5947.80]  voice of
[5947.80 --> 5948.88]  God speaking
[5948.88 --> 5949.54]  out over
[5949.54 --> 5949.92]  you and
[5949.92 --> 5950.80]  raising you
[5950.80 --> 5951.58]  up out
[5951.58 --> 5952.02]  of death.
[5952.10 --> 5952.52]  The call
[5952.52 --> 5952.94]  of God
[5952.94 --> 5953.24]  is the
[5953.24 --> 5953.94]  work of
[5953.94 --> 5954.60]  his spirit
[5954.60 --> 5955.44]  making you
[5955.44 --> 5955.92]  new.
[5956.02 --> 5956.42]  The call
[5956.42 --> 5956.88]  of God
[5956.88 --> 5957.74]  is regeneration,
[5958.46 --> 5959.16]  new life
[5959.16 --> 5960.04]  taking place
[5960.04 --> 5960.98]  in your
[5960.98 --> 5961.58]  life,
[5961.68 --> 5962.14]  taking your
[5962.14 --> 5962.50]  heart of
[5962.50 --> 5963.22]  stone and
[5963.22 --> 5963.98]  turning it
[5963.98 --> 5964.72]  into a
[5964.72 --> 5965.08]  heart of
[5965.08 --> 5965.54]  flesh.
[5966.90 --> 5967.50]  And whoever
[5967.50 --> 5968.02]  the Lord
[5968.02 --> 5968.62]  our God
[5968.62 --> 5969.28]  calls,
[5969.64 --> 5971.12]  he justifies.
[5971.94 --> 5972.24]  That is,
[5972.30 --> 5972.86]  God's call
[5972.86 --> 5973.46]  is effective.
[5974.42 --> 5974.94]  He does
[5974.94 --> 5975.30]  what he
[5975.30 --> 5976.24]  will do.
[5977.36 --> 5977.94]  God's word
[5977.94 --> 5978.68]  is powerful.
[5979.16 --> 5979.76]  By his word
[5979.76 --> 5980.46]  he created
[5980.46 --> 5981.04]  the world.
[5981.34 --> 5981.88]  His word
[5981.88 --> 5982.60]  then entered
[5982.60 --> 5983.10]  the world
[5983.10 --> 5983.92]  in Jesus
[5983.92 --> 5984.70]  and his
[5984.70 --> 5985.34]  word now
[5985.34 --> 5986.50]  calls us
[5986.50 --> 5987.58]  to newness
[5987.58 --> 5988.16]  of life
[5988.16 --> 5989.50]  in him
[5989.50 --> 5990.36]  and through
[5990.36 --> 5991.34]  him.
[5992.14 --> 5993.68]  And this
[5993.68 --> 5994.98]  is God's
[5994.98 --> 5995.98]  promise.
[5996.78 --> 5997.26]  That those
[5997.26 --> 5998.26]  he justifies
[5998.26 --> 5999.66]  he also

[6043.68 --> 6045.18]  and our
