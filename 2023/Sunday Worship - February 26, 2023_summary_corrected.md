• Equality and inclusivity are cultural values, but questions arise about their meaning and application

• Socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and ideologies create barriers to achieving true equality

• Polarization and division in society

• Propitiation: God died to bear His own wrath for our sins, providing justice and fulfilling the law
• Atonement: Christ's perfect life and death made Him the perfect atonement for our sins, forgiving us and making us righteous in God's eyes
• Sin and punishment: Sin needs punishing, and God couldn't be indifferent because it would go against His holy character; God turned justice on Himself by having Christ bear His wrath
• The cross: The cross doesn't compromise God's love or wrath, but satisfies both; it shows God as both judge and justifier, caring enough to set standards and holding us accountable while also forgiving and restoring us through faith in Christ
• The object of faith is crucial for salvation
• Faith in Jesus Christ's life, death, and resurrection matters
• It's not the amount or size of faith that saves, but what it's in
• Faith is an instrument to reveal truth, but not a source of salvation
• Putting faith in one's own abilities leads to self-reliance, rather than reliance on Jesus
• Salvation comes through faith in Jesus Christ, regardless of the amount of faith
• Applying for opportunities (school, job, mortgage) involves showing what you've done
• Salvation in various religions (Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism) requires demonstrating good deeds and works
• Christian faith is unique because salvation comes from God's righteousness offered through Christ, not earned by human actions
• Jesus' life, death, and resurrection provide the basis for Christian salvation, apart from human effort or achievement
• The gospel is not about us trying harder or doing more, but receiving God's grace and being transformed by it.
• Many people misunderstand the gospel and believe they must add certain actions or beliefs to be saved (e.g. speaking in tongues, partaking in sacraments).
• Jesus plus nothing else saves; only faith in Jesus Christ is required for salvation.
• The Bible teaches that all are justified freely by God's grace through the redemption that came by Jesus Christ.
• This righteousness is available to everyone, regardless of their background or actions, and can be received through faith in Jesus' life, death, and resurrection.
• Jesus bore the wrath of God so that humans don't have to
• Accepting this truth leads to freedom from sin and death
• The weight of sin is gone, changing the individual's life
• This gift of righteousness changes how people live, talk, and honour God
• Unity as a body comes from being handed righteousness by Christ
• Salvation is available for anyone who accepts it through faith in Jesus
• The importance of glorifying God and living in obedience to Him
• Faith as the means by which people see God's hand at work in creation, history, and their lives
• The power of faith to overcome sin and death through the Messiah
