[0.00 --> 5.00]  I believe what you say of me
[5.00 --> 8.00]  Oh, I believe
[8.00 --> 21.00]  Taking all I have and now I'm laying it at your feet
[21.00 --> 29.50]  You'll have every failure, God
[29.50 --> 33.00]  You'll have every victory
[33.00 --> 43.44]  You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing
[43.44 --> 49.88]  You say I am strong when I think I am weak
[49.88 --> 56.46]  You say I am held when I am falling short
[56.46 --> 63.12]  When I don't belong, oh, you say I'm yours
[63.12 --> 72.88]  And I believe, oh, I believe what you say of me
[72.88 --> 79.46]  I believe, oh, I believe
[79.46 --> 86.30]  Yes, I believe what you say of me
[86.30 --> 88.88]  I believe
[88.88 --> 95.46]  Oh, I believe what you say of me
[95.46 --> 102.04]  Oh, I believe what you say of me
[102.04 --> 104.04]  I believe what you say of me
[104.04 --> 106.04]  I believe what you say of me
[106.04 --> 116.62]  I believe what you say of me
[116.62 --> 120.62]  I believe what you say of me
[120.62 --> 122.62]  I believe what you say of me
[122.62 --> 137.20]  Oh, I believe what you say of me
[137.20 --> 139.42]  Over the mountains and the sea
[139.42 --> 142.16]  Your river runs with love for me
[142.16 --> 145.10]  And I will open up my heart
[145.10 --> 147.32]  And let the healer set me free
[147.32 --> 150.02]  I'm happy to be in the truth
[150.02 --> 152.76]  And I will daily lift my hands
[152.76 --> 154.84]  For I will always sing
[154.84 --> 157.28]  When your love came down
[157.28 --> 160.78]  Yeah
[160.78 --> 164.78]  Yeah
[164.78 --> 172.94]  I could say I'll be alone forever
[172.94 --> 176.68]  Oh
[176.68 --> 186.68]  Oh
[186.68 --> 188.68]  Oh
[188.68 --> 190.68]  Oh
[190.68 --> 192.68]  Oh
[192.68 --> 194.68]  Oh
[194.68 --> 196.68]  Oh
[196.68 --> 198.68]  Oh
[198.68 --> 200.68]  Oh
[200.68 --> 202.68]  Oh
[206.68 --> 208.68]  Oh
[208.68 --> 212.68]  Oh
[212.68 --> 214.68]  Oh
[214.68 --> 216.68]  Oh
[218.68 --> 222.68]  Oh
[222.68 --> 224.68]  Oh
[226.68 --> 228.68]  Oh
[228.68 --> 230.68]  Oh
[230.68 --> 236.32]  I can sing of your love forever
[236.32 --> 241.64]  I can sing of your love forever
[241.64 --> 246.94]  I can sing of your love forever
[246.94 --> 251.36]  I can sing of your love
[251.36 --> 257.54]  Oh, I feel like dancing, yeah
[257.54 --> 262.50]  It's foolishness, I know
[262.50 --> 267.70]  But when the world is in life
[267.70 --> 270.52]  They will dance with joy
[270.52 --> 273.28]  Like we're dancing now
[273.28 --> 277.92]  I can sing of your love forever
[277.92 --> 283.56]  I can sing of your love forever
[283.56 --> 289.30]  I can sing of your love forever
[289.30 --> 293.88]  I can sing of your love forever
[294.46 --> 299.38]  I will sing of your love forever
[299.38 --> 302.56]  I can sing of your love forever
[302.56 --> 305.60]  I'll lift my hands and raise your hand
[305.60 --> 309.98]  I will sing of your love forever
[309.98 --> 314.90]  I will sing of your love
[314.90 --> 320.60]  I will sing of your love
[320.60 --> 322.60]  I will sing of your love
[335.60 --> 345.54]  I will sing of your love forever
[345.54 --> 355.94]  I will sing of your love forever
[355.94 --> 363.72]  I will sing of your love forever
[363.72 --> 393.70]  Praise the name of God.
[393.72 --> 423.70]  Praise the name of God.
[423.72 --> 429.44]  Holiness, holiness is what I long for.
[430.36 --> 434.02]  Holiness is what I need.
[436.96 --> 443.80]  Holiness, holiness is what you want from me.
[443.80 --> 456.32]  Holiness, holiness is what I long for.
[457.78 --> 461.44]  Holiness is what I need.
[461.44 --> 491.42]  Holiness, holiness is what I need.
[491.94 --> 493.98]  Whether to make it to church this morning.
[494.08 --> 496.60]  And to those of you online, welcome as well.
[496.66 --> 501.64]  Hopefully you're cuddled up with a blanket and a cup of tea and are tuning in as well this morning.
[502.16 --> 504.98]  Before we start, my name is Kevin Lohbert.
[505.10 --> 508.22]  I am the youth pastor here at Langley Emanuel CRC.
[508.28 --> 510.00]  And it's great to see you this morning.
[510.32 --> 513.98]  I've got a few announcements once I turn my page.
[514.04 --> 516.34]  Actually, I've got a lot of announcements, but I'll be quick.
[516.40 --> 517.26]  Are we ready? Here we go.
[517.40 --> 520.96]  First of all, young adult Bible study was supposed to happen after church today.
[521.12 --> 523.32]  That has been canceled due to weather.
[523.44 --> 526.72]  However, if you are a young adult, or you feel like a young adult,
[526.86 --> 528.32]  or you just want a free lunch,
[528.62 --> 531.04]  you are still welcome to go to Sarah Molenkamp's house
[531.04 --> 532.94]  because she made a ton of soup for that event.
[532.94 --> 536.18]  So, you can head over to the Molenkamp's, right, Sarah?
[537.04 --> 538.76]  Maybe not the last part, she said.
[538.76 --> 540.34]  But talk to her after church.
[540.42 --> 541.42]  She would love to have you over.
[541.84 --> 543.70]  Come get a bowl of soup at her place.
[543.80 --> 548.34]  Second of all, there was a request in the e-bulletin for a billet for someone at classes.
[548.68 --> 549.94]  That request has been filled.
[550.26 --> 552.48]  So, thank you so much for whomever is doing that.
[552.82 --> 554.42]  No need to reply to that anymore.
[554.62 --> 558.76]  Thirdly, Pastor Chris is starting up a course called Christianity Explored.
[559.40 --> 561.68]  There are a number of people who signed up to take that.
[562.04 --> 566.44]  That starts this coming Wednesday at 7 p.m. till 8.15 p.m.
[566.44 --> 569.04]  If you are interested in that, please talk to Pastor Chris
[569.04 --> 571.94]  and see if you can join that on Wednesday as well.
[573.00 --> 574.76]  Worship at Sunridge Gardens.
[574.94 --> 577.80]  There's a home up the hill here where a number of our members join.
[577.88 --> 580.60]  We lead worship there once a month the first Saturday.
[581.06 --> 584.52]  That is happening this coming Saturday, March 4th at 2 p.m.
[584.52 --> 586.88]  All are welcome to join that.
[587.02 --> 589.52]  So, please come out to that if you would like.
[590.48 --> 591.26]  HCBC Youth.
[591.36 --> 594.86]  We've got Catechism, Belgic Confession tonight here at 7 p.m.
[594.98 --> 596.00]  Hopefully, you can come out.
[596.06 --> 596.66]  We'll see you then.
[597.52 --> 598.82]  Wednesday, March 8th.
[598.84 --> 599.52]  Another thing.
[599.90 --> 602.58]  We are going to be doing an evening prayer service.
[602.70 --> 604.08]  Wednesday, March the 8th.
[604.12 --> 605.82]  Keep your eyes on the bulletin for that.
[606.12 --> 607.96]  That will start at 7 p.m.
[608.02 --> 608.62]  We'll see you there.
[608.62 --> 615.94]  And finally, a big thank you to all of you who supported, prayed for, and walked at the
[615.94 --> 617.74]  coldest night of the year last night.
[618.02 --> 622.06]  Our church raised almost $5,000 for the Gateway of Hope, which is incredible.
[623.84 --> 624.32]  Yeah.
[625.60 --> 628.38]  It was a very cool event to be at.
[628.42 --> 631.44]  There's a lot of people from all over Langley there as well.
[631.86 --> 636.68]  And it was just a good time and a good experience there for everybody involved.
[636.76 --> 637.54]  So, thank you for that.
[637.54 --> 643.48]  I would love to invite you to stand now, please, and receive God's greeting this morning.
[647.44 --> 650.18]  God's greeting this morning comes from Revelation 1.
[650.52 --> 656.94]  Grace and peace to you from him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven
[656.94 --> 661.90]  spirits that are before his throne, and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness,
[662.32 --> 666.16]  the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth.
[666.16 --> 671.28]  And all God's people said, please take a minute to just greet those around you this morning.
[671.28 --> 671.60]  Amen.
[671.60 --> 671.88]  Amen.
[671.88 --> 672.10]  Amen.
[672.10 --> 672.42]  Amen.
[672.42 --> 672.50]  Amen.
[672.50 --> 702.48]  Thank you.
[702.50 --> 703.78]  Psalm 118.
[732.50 --> 733.50]  For he is good.
[733.82 --> 735.76]  His love endures forever.
[735.76 --> 763.76]  Come, now is the time to worship.
[763.76 --> 773.76]  Now is the time to give your heart
[773.76 --> 781.26]  Come, just as you are to worship
[781.26 --> 790.76]  Come, just as you are before your God
[790.76 --> 799.86]  Come, one day every tongue will confess you are God
[799.86 --> 802.76]  One day every knee will bow
[802.76 --> 812.76]  Still the greatest treasure remains for those who gladly choose you now
[812.76 --> 821.86]  Come, now is the time to worship
[821.86 --> 830.86]  Come, now is the time to give your heart
[830.86 --> 839.96]  Come, just as you are to worship
[839.96 --> 847.96]  Come, just as you are before your God
[847.96 --> 853.06]  Come, just as you are before your God
[853.06 --> 857.06]  One day every tongue will confess you are God
[857.06 --> 861.06]  One day every knee will bow
[861.06 --> 869.06]  Still the greatest treasure remains for those who gladly choose you now
[869.06 --> 874.16]  Willingly we choose to surrender our lives
[874.16 --> 878.16]  Willingly our knees will bow
[878.16 --> 881.16]  With our hearts, soul, mind and strength
[881.16 --> 887.26]  We gladly choose you now
[887.26 --> 896.36]  Come, now is the time to worship
[896.36 --> 905.36]  Come, now is the time to give your heart
[905.36 --> 912.36]  Come, just as you are to worship
[912.36 --> 921.46]  Come, just as you are before your God
[921.46 --> 923.46]  Come
[923.46 --> 924.46]  Come
[924.46 --> 928.06]  Come, just as you are before your God
[928.06 --> 937.56]  Come, just as you are before your love
[937.56 --> 941.96]  Come, just as you are before your honor
[941.96 --> 942.56]  Help
[942.56 --> 943.56]  in your name
[943.56 --> 947.56]  You areины

[977.48 --> 983.28]  I'll worship your holy name
[983.28 --> 990.48]  The sun comes up
[990.48 --> 994.40]  It's a new day dawning
[994.40 --> 1000.44]  It's time to sing your song again
[1000.44 --> 1003.76]  Whatever may pass
[1003.76 --> 1008.56]  And whatever lies before me
[1008.56 --> 1011.88]  Let me be singing
[1011.88 --> 1016.62]  When the evening comes
[1016.62 --> 1023.56]  Bless the Lord, O my soul
[1023.56 --> 1026.76]  O my soul
[1026.76 --> 1031.36]  Worship his holy name

[1052.76 --> 1056.34]  And you're so too angry
[1056.34 --> 1058.60]  Your name is great
[1058.60 --> 1062.40]  And your heart is kind
[1062.40 --> 1065.50]  For all your goodness
[1065.50 --> 1069.40]  I will keep on singing

[1111.40 --> 1114.28]  And on that day
[1114.28 --> 1118.10]  When my strength is failing
[1118.10 --> 1120.40]  The end draws near
[1120.40 --> 1124.30]  And my time has come
[1124.30 --> 1126.30]  Still my soul
[1126.30 --> 1127.40]  Still my soul

[1195.42 --> 1202.02]  I'll worship your holy name
[1202.02 --> 1207.82]  Lord, I'll worship your holy name
[1207.82 --> 1211.62]  You may have a seat
[1211.62 --> 1223.32]  And God spoke all of these words
[1223.32 --> 1227.64]  I am the Lord, your God
[1227.64 --> 1229.30]  Who brought you out of Egypt
[1229.30 --> 1231.72]  Out of that land of slavery
[1231.72 --> 1235.72]  You shall have no other gods before me
[1235.72 --> 1239.06]  You shall not make for yourself
[1239.06 --> 1241.36]  An image in the form of anything
[1241.36 --> 1242.32]  In heaven above
[1242.32 --> 1244.26]  Or on the earth beneath
[1244.26 --> 1246.10]  Or in the waters below
[1246.10 --> 1249.18]  You shall not bow down
[1249.18 --> 1251.30]  To them or worship them
[1251.30 --> 1253.62]  For I, the Lord your God
[1253.62 --> 1254.80]  Am a jealous God
[1254.80 --> 1256.42]  Punishing the children
[1256.42 --> 1257.70]  For the sin of the parents
[1257.70 --> 1260.38]  To the third and fourth generation
[1260.38 --> 1262.00]  Of those who hate me
[1262.00 --> 1265.30]  But showing steadfast love
[1265.30 --> 1267.50]  To thousands of generations
[1267.50 --> 1268.80]  Of those who love me
[1268.80 --> 1270.70]  And keep my commandments
[1270.70 --> 1274.10]  You shall not misuse
[1274.10 --> 1275.94]  The name of the Lord your God
[1275.94 --> 1278.38]  For the Lord will not hold
[1278.38 --> 1279.40]  Anyone guiltless
[1279.40 --> 1281.54]  Who misuses his name
[1281.54 --> 1284.62]  Remember the Sabbath day
[1284.62 --> 1285.72]  By keeping it holy
[1285.72 --> 1288.32]  Six days you shall labor
[1288.32 --> 1289.82]  And do all your work
[1289.82 --> 1291.02]  But the seventh day
[1291.02 --> 1292.16]  Is a Sabbath day
[1292.16 --> 1293.94]  To the Lord your God
[1293.94 --> 1297.02]  On it you shall not do any work
[1297.02 --> 1297.96]  Neither you
[1297.96 --> 1299.42]  Nor your son or daughter
[1299.42 --> 1301.70]  Nor your male or female servant
[1301.70 --> 1303.26]  Nor your animals
[1303.26 --> 1304.74]  Nor any foreigner
[1304.74 --> 1306.12]  Residing in your town
[1306.12 --> 1308.46]  For in six days
[1308.46 --> 1309.86]  The Lord made the heavens
[1309.86 --> 1310.64]  And the earth
[1310.64 --> 1313.28]  The sea and all that is in them
[1313.28 --> 1315.94]  But he rested on the seventh day
[1315.94 --> 1320.10]  Therefore the Lord blessed
[1320.10 --> 1320.96]  The Sabbath day
[1320.96 --> 1322.02]  And made it holy
[1322.02 --> 1324.44]  Honor your father
[1324.44 --> 1325.32]  And your mother
[1325.32 --> 1327.34]  So that you may live long
[1327.34 --> 1328.02]  In the land
[1328.02 --> 1330.00]  The Lord your God
[1330.00 --> 1330.84]  Is giving you
[1330.84 --> 1333.02]  You shall not murder
[1333.02 --> 1335.94]  You shall not commit adultery
[1335.94 --> 1337.50]  You shall not steal
[1337.50 --> 1340.12]  You shall not give false testimony
[1340.12 --> 1341.08]  Against your neighbor
[1341.08 --> 1342.88]  You shall not covet
[1342.88 --> 1343.96]  Your neighbor's house
[1343.96 --> 1345.54]  You shall not covet
[1345.54 --> 1346.42]  Your neighbor's wife
[1346.42 --> 1348.94]  Or his male or female servant
[1348.94 --> 1350.88]  His ox or donkey
[1350.88 --> 1353.00]  Or anything that belongs
[1353.00 --> 1353.88]  To your neighbor
[1353.88 --> 1356.42]  What the people saw
[1356.42 --> 1357.74]  When the people saw
[1357.74 --> 1358.72]  The thunder and lightning
[1358.72 --> 1359.84]  And heard the trumpet
[1359.84 --> 1361.98]  And saw the mountain in smoke
[1361.98 --> 1363.68]  They trembled in fear
[1363.68 --> 1366.06]  They stayed at a distance
[1366.06 --> 1367.34]  And said to Moses
[1367.34 --> 1369.50]  Speak to us yourself
[1369.50 --> 1371.34]  And we will listen
[1371.34 --> 1374.38]  But do not have God speak to us
[1374.38 --> 1375.78]  Or we will die
[1375.78 --> 1378.40]  Please rise for our next song
[1378.40 --> 1396.50]  On the valley
[1396.94 --> 1399.72]  Oh sacred
[1399.72 --> 1412.20]  O sacred head now wounded
[1412.20 --> 1418.56]  With grief and shame weighed down
[1418.56 --> 1424.96]  Now scornfully surrounded
[1424.96 --> 1431.30]  With thorns your only crown
[1431.30 --> 1438.02]  O sacred head, what glory
[1438.02 --> 1444.18]  And blessing you have known
[1444.18 --> 1450.72]  Yet though despised and gory
[1450.72 --> 1457.06]  I claim you as my own
[1457.06 --> 1464.06]  My Lord, what you did suffer
[1464.06 --> 1470.06]  Was all for sinners' gain
[1470.06 --> 1477.28]  Mine, mine was the transgression
[1477.28 --> 1483.36]  But yours the deathly pain
[1483.36 --> 1489.40]  So here I kneel my Savior
[1489.40 --> 1496.00]  For I deserve your place
[1496.00 --> 1502.48]  Look on me with your favor
[1502.48 --> 1508.74]  And save me by your grace
[1508.74 --> 1516.60]  What language shall I borrow
[1516.60 --> 1522.88]  To thank you, dearest friend
[1522.88 --> 1529.58]  For this your dying sorrow
[1529.58 --> 1535.74]  Your mercy without end
[1535.74 --> 1542.22]  Lord, make me yours forever
[1542.22 --> 1547.90]  A loyal servant true
[1547.90 --> 1555.22]  And let me never, ever
[1555.22 --> 1561.74]  Outlive my love for you
[1561.74 --> 1566.76]  And continuing from Exodus 20
[1566.76 --> 1568.70]  Verse 20 says
[1568.70 --> 1570.40]  Moses said to the people
[1570.40 --> 1572.08]  Do not be afraid
[1572.08 --> 1574.44]  God has come to test you
[1574.44 --> 1576.28]  So that the fear of God
[1576.28 --> 1577.40]  Will be with you
[1577.40 --> 1579.08]  To keep you from sinning
[1579.62 --> 1580.80]  Let's pray
[1580.80 --> 1584.20]  Father, we thank you
[1584.20 --> 1586.46]  For the promise of being with us
[1586.46 --> 1589.18]  Regardless of how we have fallen short
[1589.18 --> 1590.58]  And disappointed you
[1590.58 --> 1593.56]  We do not keep your commandments
[1593.56 --> 1595.80]  Yet you still love us
[1595.80 --> 1597.38]  And draw us to yourself
[1597.38 --> 1599.82]  Thank you for the Holy Spirit's
[1599.82 --> 1601.06]  Presence in our lives
[1601.06 --> 1603.36]  That convicts us of our sin
[1603.36 --> 1605.46]  Thank you for your mercy
[1605.46 --> 1607.00]  So undeserving
[1607.00 --> 1609.28]  In Jesus' name we pray
[1609.28 --> 1610.36]  Amen
[1610.36 --> 1640.34]  What gift of grace is Jesus my name?
[1640.34 --> 1642.34]  He is my redeemer
[1642.34 --> 1645.56]  There is no more
[1645.56 --> 1649.34]  For heaven now to give
[1649.34 --> 1652.34]  He is my joy
[1652.34 --> 1656.34]  My righteousness and freedom
[1656.34 --> 1659.34]  My steadfast love
[1659.34 --> 1663.34]  My deep and boundless peace
[1663.34 --> 1666.34]  To this I hope
[1666.34 --> 1670.34]  My hope is only Jesus
[1670.34 --> 1676.34]  For my life is wholly bound to His
[1676.34 --> 1682.34]  Oh how strange and divine
[1682.34 --> 1685.34]  I can sing all this might
[1685.34 --> 1687.34]  Yet not I
[1687.34 --> 1692.34]  But through Christ in me
[1692.34 --> 1705.72]  The night is dark
[1705.72 --> 1709.14]  But I am not forsaken
[1709.14 --> 1712.62]  For by my side
[1712.62 --> 1715.34]  The Savior He will stay
[1715.34 --> 1718.34]  I labor on
[1718.34 --> 1719.62]  I labor on
[1719.62 --> 1720.34]  In weakness
[1720.34 --> 1720.96]  In weakness
[1720.96 --> 1723.34]  And rejoicing
[1723.34 --> 1726.34]  For in my need
[1726.34 --> 1729.34]  His power is displayed
[1729.34 --> 1731.34]  To this I hope
[1731.34 --> 1733.34]  To this I hope
[1733.34 --> 1737.34]  My shepherd will defend me
[1737.34 --> 1744.34]  Through the deepest valley He will be
[1744.34 --> 1748.34]  For the night has been won
[1748.34 --> 1751.34]  And I shall overcome
[1751.34 --> 1753.34]  Yet not I
[1753.34 --> 1757.34]  But through Christ in me
[1757.34 --> 1771.34]  No fate I dread
[1771.34 --> 1774.34]  I know I am forgiven
[1774.34 --> 1778.34]  The future's sure
[1778.34 --> 1783.34]  The price it has been paid
[1783.34 --> 1785.34]  For Jesus bled
[1785.34 --> 1789.34]  And suffered for my pardon
[1789.34 --> 1792.34]  And He was raised
[1792.34 --> 1796.34]  To overthrow the grave
[1796.34 --> 1799.34]  To this I hold
[1799.34 --> 1803.34]  My sin has been defeated
[1803.34 --> 1805.34]  Jesus now
[1805.34 --> 1806.34]  Jesus now
[1806.34 --> 1808.34]  And ever
[1808.34 --> 1810.34]  Is my King
[1810.34 --> 1813.34]  All the chains
[1813.34 --> 1814.34]  Are released
[1814.34 --> 1816.34]  I can sing
[1816.34 --> 1818.34]  I am free
[1818.34 --> 1820.34]  Yet not I
[1820.34 --> 1823.34]  But through Christ in me
[1823.34 --> 1837.34]  With every breath
[1837.34 --> 1841.34]  I long to follow Jesus
[1841.34 --> 1844.34]  For He has said
[1844.34 --> 1848.34]  That He will bring me home
[1848.34 --> 1851.34]  And day by day
[1851.34 --> 1855.34]  I know He will renew me
[1855.34 --> 1857.34]  Until I stand
[1857.34 --> 1861.34]  With joy before the throne
[1861.34 --> 1864.34]  To this I hold
[1864.34 --> 1868.34]  My hope is only Jesus
[1868.34 --> 1874.34]  All the glory evermore to Him
[1874.34 --> 1879.34]  When the race is complete
[1879.34 --> 1882.34]  Still my lips shall repeat
[1882.34 --> 1884.34]  Yet not I
[1884.34 --> 1886.34]  But through Christ in me
[1886.34 --> 1887.34]  Still my lips shall repeat
[1887.34 --> 1888.34]  Yet not I
[1888.34 --> 1889.34]  But through Christ in me
[1889.34 --> 1891.34]  To this I hold
[1891.34 --> 1894.34]  My hope is only Jesus
[1894.34 --> 1900.34]  All the glory evermore to Him
[1900.34 --> 1906.34]  When the race is complete
[1906.34 --> 1910.34]  Still my lips shall repeat
[1910.34 --> 1911.34]  Yet not I
[1911.34 --> 1916.34]  But through Christ in me
[1916.34 --> 1921.34]  When the race is complete
[1921.34 --> 1924.34]  Still my lips shall repeat
[1924.34 --> 1925.34]  Yet not I
[1925.34 --> 1927.34]  But through Christ in me
[1927.34 --> 1930.34]  For through Christ in me
[1930.34 --> 1932.34]  You will be
[1932.34 --> 1934.34]  To me
[1934.34 --> 1935.34]  And through Christ in me
[1935.34 --> 1936.34]  To me
[1936.34 --> 1937.34]  To me
[1937.34 --> 1938.34]  To me
[1938.34 --> 1939.34]  To me

[2558.44 --> 2560.44]  know what you...
[2560.44 --> 2562.44]  you're the
[2562.44 --> 2564.44]  you can
[2564.44 --> 2570.96]  there. There's some pictures that are going to pop up and you tell me who are these people.
[2573.18 --> 2581.62]  Who is that guy? Is his name the Lion King? No, no. Who is that guy or guy? Lion. Scar.
[2583.08 --> 2588.66]  Who is he in the Lion King? He's a bad guy. He's okay. He's the bad guy.
[2588.66 --> 2599.48]  Oh, yes. Simba's uncle. It's so confusing. Next picture. Who is this character? Ursula.
[2600.40 --> 2608.80]  Yeah, probably like the worst one out there. An enemy. Yes. Okay. These are great words.
[2609.66 --> 2617.42]  Next picture. Last one. Who is this? Mayor Humdinger. And who is he?
[2617.42 --> 2628.08]  A bad guy. He's also a bad guy? Oh. Is he in where? In Paw Patrol show. Yeah, for sure. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
[2628.16 --> 2632.92]  All these bad guys. Why are we talking about all these bad guys today? I don't know. It's so confusing
[2632.92 --> 2640.38]  because we have been talking in Children's Worship Time about the book of Samuel and about all the big
[2640.38 --> 2647.14]  themes in there around King David, right? And who's the other king in there that we've been talking
[2647.14 --> 2653.14]  about? There's King David. And who was the king before him? King Saul. Yeah. So today we're
[2653.14 --> 2656.18]  going to talk a little bit more about that. I want to talk a little bit about bad guys,
[2657.04 --> 2662.14]  but how bad guys maybe aren't always what we think they are. And maybe God sees them differently.
[2662.98 --> 2667.62]  So let's stand and we'll do the Children's Blessing and then we'll head off to Children's Worship
[2667.62 --> 2675.12]  the Children's Blessing and then we'll head off to Children's Worship time. Ready? May the Lord be with you.
[2675.12 --> 2705.10]  Thank you.
[2705.12 --> 2711.10]  As some of you may have noticed in the bulletin, there was a mention of Leanne Harris' dad passing away last Thursday.
[2712.72 --> 2715.20]  We'd like to pray for that family and their grief.
[2715.42 --> 2729.94]  We also have to mention that Pete Birkenpass and his mom, also Wes's sister, Matt's grandmother, passed away last Friday after three weeks being in the hospital.
[2729.94 --> 2731.98]  So we'd like to pray for that family as well.
[2733.36 --> 2735.02]  Let us come to the Lord in prayer.
[2735.12 --> 2741.04]  Lord, we come before you as a smaller group today.
[2741.46 --> 2745.62]  Lord, the weather affected a few people being able to make it.
[2746.14 --> 2747.90]  But Lord, we know that you are sovereign.
[2748.90 --> 2751.92]  You are in control of everything and you are a great God.
[2752.32 --> 2755.42]  We give you the praise and honor and glory that is due your name.
[2755.42 --> 2759.80]  Lord, we come as humble and contrite believers.
[2760.60 --> 2761.86]  We sin in our hearts.
[2762.76 --> 2771.90]  Lord, not always wanted to do what is right, but with faith we work to live our lives according to your will.
[2772.86 --> 2774.74]  Lord, we ask your blessing on this service.
[2774.94 --> 2779.76]  Lord, we ask a blessing on the children's worship time and the leaders and teachers there.
[2779.76 --> 2783.52]  Lord, those young hearts may be able to know your will too for their lives.
[2785.52 --> 2791.92]  Lord, there's many other aspects of our church life that people are busy with.
[2792.48 --> 2798.68]  Lord, we pray for cadets and gems programs, coffee break programs, seniors ministries.
[2798.68 --> 2805.76]  Lord, we are thankful for the many people that come and give their time and gifts to be able to serve those ministries.
[2806.40 --> 2810.06]  That we may be able to reach out to many hearts and lives.
[2811.06 --> 2816.18]  Lord, we are thankful for the walk that Coldest Night of the Year was able to have
[2816.18 --> 2819.58]  and many people in our congregation was able to give of their time and energy.
[2819.58 --> 2823.16]  Lord, this is a need that we have in our community.
[2824.04 --> 2832.60]  Lord, we are also called to support those that are in need, those who are homeless and have not much hope in life.
[2833.28 --> 2838.94]  We pray that we may be effective witnesses as we give of our time and energy to these ministries.
[2840.80 --> 2844.24]  Lord, we know that there are many people that are grieving.
[2844.24 --> 2850.82]  Lord, we think especially of Leon Harris and her family as they grieve the loss of her dad who has been sick for a while.
[2851.68 --> 2855.16]  Lord, we pray for comfort and strength for that family.
[2855.46 --> 2864.14]  We pray for Pete and Doreen and Matt and Anna and also Wes and Lena as they grieve the loss of a loved one.
[2865.42 --> 2867.40]  Lord, we pray for comfort and blessing there too.
[2868.80 --> 2872.16]  And Lord, there's others in our congregation that have grief in their hearts.
[2872.16 --> 2875.78]  Sometimes from years past, we pray for comfort for each one.
[2876.74 --> 2879.92]  Your spirit may work and support and uphold them too.
[2881.08 --> 2884.16]  We pray for those that are ill.
[2885.02 --> 2888.02]  Lord, some people are battling with cancer and other illnesses.
[2888.34 --> 2889.32]  We pray for Cy Visser.
[2890.52 --> 2892.88]  That his cancer treatment may be effective for healing.
[2893.72 --> 2897.68]  Be with others that are battling colds and flus.
[2897.68 --> 2901.94]  Lord, that goes around and many people suffer.
[2902.90 --> 2906.92]  We pray for those that are suffering with mental illness and addictions.
[2907.72 --> 2911.52]  Lord, bring comfort that we may be a blessing to those that are in need.
[2912.32 --> 2919.50]  That we can be a helping hand and a warm heart and helping those who are also in that need.
[2919.50 --> 2928.88]  Lord, we think of world relief programs that are happening, especially with the earthquake in Syria and Turkey.
[2929.54 --> 2932.78]  Lord, many lives are lost and there is much need there.
[2933.72 --> 2938.78]  May we be a giving community to help those in need across the globe.
[2939.78 --> 2944.56]  We pray for the people in Ukraine that are still being embattled.
[2944.84 --> 2946.52]  We pray for peace there.
[2946.52 --> 2953.30]  Lord, we pray that your spirit may work in various ministries that are bringing your gospel around the world.
[2954.12 --> 2959.54]  Lord, to those that don't know you, we ask that those ministries may be blessed in their work.
[2960.34 --> 2963.38]  We pray for Pastor Chris too as he preaches your word.
[2964.58 --> 2966.82]  Lord, that your word may work into our hearts and lives.
[2967.50 --> 2973.06]  That we may be able to share the blessing of the gospel that you have given for us.
[2973.06 --> 2979.76]  Lord, may we go out this coming week to serve you in everything that we say and do.
[2980.82 --> 2985.32]  That we may show your light to those who don't know your will.
[2986.60 --> 2990.78]  Lord, we do this as humble Christians and humble believers, humble sinners.
[2992.16 --> 2995.80]  We ask this in the name of Jesus Christ who gave his life for us.
[2996.78 --> 2998.40]  This we ask in your name alone.
[2998.88 --> 2999.12]  Amen.
[3003.06 --> 3026.50]  We are going to continue our way through the book of Romans this morning.
[3026.50 --> 3030.36]  And we're actually going to be wrapping up chapter 3 here today.
[3030.36 --> 3038.54]  As far as fully understanding the gospel, Romans is one of the most important books in the Bible.
[3038.74 --> 3046.32]  And in this letter, Paul addresses all sorts of things like salvation, faith, righteousness, and what it means to be justified.
[3047.28 --> 3056.68]  Specifically in the passage that we're going to look at today, Romans 3 verses 21 to 31, he gets right at the heart of these matters.
[3056.68 --> 3064.08]  Honestly, the importance of today's passage, not just for Romans, but for the whole book of the Bible, it cannot be overstated.
[3064.66 --> 3067.50]  Hear what a few scholars have said about the passage we're going to read this morning.
[3067.56 --> 3068.72]  This is what some scholars have said.
[3068.78 --> 3076.26]  Martin Luther said that today's text is the chief point of the entire epistle, the chief point of Paul's letter, and of the whole Bible.
[3077.26 --> 3083.18]  New Testament scholar C.E.B. Cranfield calls this passage the center and the heart of the whole letter.
[3083.18 --> 3087.12]  Similarly, Mike Bird calls it the epicenter of Paul's gospel.
[3087.28 --> 3098.48]  And not to be outdone, New Testament scholar Leanne Morris says that Romans 3 verses 21 to 26 is possibly the most important paragraph ever written.
[3099.96 --> 3100.42]  Intrigued?
[3101.70 --> 3102.40]  Let's read it together.
[3102.48 --> 3109.00]  We're going to read Romans 3, 21 to 31, but we'll especially focus on verses 21 to 26 today.
[3109.00 --> 3111.64]  So if you've got your Bibles, please open those up.
[3111.74 --> 3113.16]  Open your Bible apps with you.
[3113.20 --> 3116.74]  Have those open throughout the message as we're going to be referencing throughout.
[3116.90 --> 3118.74]  And please follow along.
[3118.86 --> 3120.96]  Romans 3, 21 to 31 says,
[3120.96 --> 3129.26]  But now, apart from the law of the righteousness of God has been made known, to which the law and the prophets testify,
[3130.22 --> 3135.88]  this righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe.
[3136.56 --> 3143.12]  There is no difference between Jew and Gentile, for all have sinned and all fall short of the glory of God,
[3143.12 --> 3150.06]  and all are justified freely by His grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.
[3150.98 --> 3158.38]  God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement through the shedding of His blood to be received by faith.
[3158.74 --> 3163.30]  He did this to demonstrate His righteousness because in His forbearance, that means mercy,
[3163.98 --> 3167.16]  He has left the sins committed beforehand unpunished.
[3167.16 --> 3171.64]  He did it to demonstrate His righteousness at the present time,
[3172.16 --> 3177.88]  so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.
[3179.38 --> 3180.84]  Where, then, is boasting?
[3181.62 --> 3182.36]  It is excluded.
[3183.20 --> 3184.32]  Because of what law?
[3185.02 --> 3186.38]  The law that requires works?
[3186.54 --> 3188.92]  No, because of the law that requires faith.
[3189.26 --> 3194.64]  For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.
[3194.64 --> 3198.24]  Or is God of the Jews only?
[3198.82 --> 3200.50]  Is He not the God of Gentiles too?
[3200.92 --> 3206.20]  Yes, of Gentiles too, since there is only one God who will justify the circumcised by faith
[3206.20 --> 3209.96]  and the uncircumcised through that same faith.
[3211.28 --> 3213.98]  Do we then nullify the law by this faith?
[3214.64 --> 3215.34]  Not at all.
[3216.18 --> 3217.78]  Rather, we uphold the law.
[3218.48 --> 3219.20]  The word of the Lord.
[3221.76 --> 3223.56]  Now, this passage starts with the words,
[3223.56 --> 3224.26]  But now.
[3225.54 --> 3226.50]  But now.
[3226.62 --> 3231.60]  These two words are pretty darn glorious in the context of our sermon series.
[3232.20 --> 3234.20]  In the last four sermons throughout Romans,
[3234.64 --> 3237.66]  basically the entirety of the letter until this point,
[3238.06 --> 3243.20]  the universal human problem of sin has been revealed and exposed.
[3244.06 --> 3247.90]  But now, with today's passage, this problem of sin is resolved.
[3247.90 --> 3252.72]  But now, Jesus comes to solve the problem.
[3253.78 --> 3256.48]  But now, Jesus intervenes.
[3257.48 --> 3263.88]  Now, clearly that's important, but why does someone like Morris say that this is possibly the most important paragraph ever written?
[3263.88 --> 3271.20]  Well, the reason that this passage is so important is that it lays out the pinnacle of the gospel story,
[3271.36 --> 3275.42]  and it pours out truth that is not just for you and not just for me today,
[3275.42 --> 3278.36]  but for all of humanity, for all of time.
[3278.36 --> 3284.66]  What this passage is all about is this, that Jesus gives us righteousness,
[3285.18 --> 3287.76]  which we receive through faith in him.
[3289.40 --> 3296.10]  Jesus gives us righteousness, which we receive through faith in him.
[3297.78 --> 3298.96]  That's the big idea.
[3299.14 --> 3301.68]  That's the news that we're going to look at today.
[3301.68 --> 3305.10]  Now, let me do something a little bit different here this morning.
[3305.20 --> 3307.84]  We're going to start off with some present-day context,
[3307.84 --> 3310.86]  which will help explain why this passage matters so much.
[3310.92 --> 3314.00]  We usually look at the context of the passage first,
[3314.10 --> 3317.98]  but today, let's use our current context to sort of set the scene.
[3318.40 --> 3321.22]  Now, our culture right now is all about equality.
[3322.06 --> 3327.88]  You can call it social tolerance, secular humanism, social decency, human decency,
[3327.88 --> 3328.92]  whatever you want.
[3328.92 --> 3331.94]  But our culture desires inclusivity.
[3332.74 --> 3335.30]  If we aren't moving forward, if we're not progressing,
[3335.94 --> 3337.32]  we're moving backwards.
[3337.46 --> 3338.12]  We're regressing.
[3340.04 --> 3341.80]  That's what our culture is all about.
[3341.92 --> 3343.36]  But there's questions to that.
[3343.42 --> 3345.08]  Making progress from what?
[3345.46 --> 3346.30]  Or to where?
[3346.42 --> 3347.26]  Or for who?
[3347.44 --> 3348.36]  Or to what end?
[3348.94 --> 3352.98]  See, the idea of equality or tolerance or inclusivity, it sounds good.
[3353.26 --> 3356.28]  And I believe that this is coming from good places.
[3356.28 --> 3359.68]  I believe that the hearts of those pushing this are really genuine.
[3359.84 --> 3361.02]  They are wanting what's best.
[3361.34 --> 3365.24]  But holes start to appear when we start prodding and asking questions.
[3365.54 --> 3366.50]  Equality for who?
[3366.96 --> 3367.36]  Everyone?
[3367.74 --> 3369.28]  How so and in what capacity?
[3369.56 --> 3372.14]  Are we looking for equal outcomes or equal opportunities?
[3372.46 --> 3374.42]  By what means or what measures?
[3374.70 --> 3377.74]  Who's the gatekeeper of this ultimate progress?
[3378.22 --> 3379.46]  When do we get there?
[3379.62 --> 3380.74]  When is that accomplished?
[3380.74 --> 3387.16]  See, a big problem with seeking equality without God, without God,
[3388.20 --> 3390.06]  is we don't know what equality looks like.
[3391.04 --> 3395.46]  Equality or inclusivity, it looks different to everyone because we are all so different.
[3395.94 --> 3399.80]  And what we want or desire or believe is true equality is different for everyone.
[3400.32 --> 3402.66]  Barriers pop up in this conversation everywhere.
[3403.08 --> 3404.96]  Barriers that we know very well.
[3404.96 --> 3409.52]  Because we live in a broken world.
[3410.62 --> 3417.64]  Barriers of ethnicity, barriers of socioeconomic status, barriers of ideologies, to name the big three.
[3420.74 --> 3425.16]  What equality looks like for people is different depending on the color of their skin
[3425.16 --> 3428.18]  and equally important, the land or the country with which they reside.
[3428.18 --> 3435.24]  Equality or inclusion for one ethnic minority here in Canada looks different than equality or inclusion
[3435.24 --> 3441.14]  for another ethnic minority in Saudi Arabia or China or Nigeria or Colombia or pick a country.
[3442.18 --> 3443.72]  And it gets broader than that too.
[3444.20 --> 3448.38]  What progress looks like for the upper class looks different than progress for the middle class
[3448.38 --> 3450.00]  and progress for the lower class.
[3450.82 --> 3456.38]  Those socioeconomic divides change even further when you zoom out and see what's happening around the world.
[3456.38 --> 3464.92]  Ideologies on progress change too depending on what your solutions or ideas are for progress or equality or inclusion.
[3465.38 --> 3467.14]  You're labeled a liberal or a conservative.
[3467.66 --> 3469.36]  You're labeled progressive or traditional.
[3469.76 --> 3471.48]  You're open-minded or you're conventional.
[3471.88 --> 3473.46]  We're very polarized right now.
[3474.32 --> 3476.80]  No matter what, you're butting heads with someone else.
[3477.04 --> 3481.74]  Even if you're reaching for the same means of inclusion, the same means of equality.
[3481.74 --> 3489.00]  And if you're butting heads with someone, the other is being unjust or exclusive or intolerant.
[3489.38 --> 3495.56]  It's hard to move forward when you're constantly leaving the majority of the people behind in the rearview mirror.
[3496.58 --> 3501.98]  So whatever our solutions are for ethnic, social, or ideological change, whatever those may be,
[3502.20 --> 3505.48]  we have different views, we have different opinions, we have different perspectives,
[3505.48 --> 3507.50]  even if our goals look similar.
[3508.88 --> 3512.86]  Equality, tolerance, inclusivity, all seemingly good things,
[3513.54 --> 3518.80]  but they're all out of reach because people are always going to be people.
[3520.24 --> 3523.62]  Sinful, broken, pigeonholed, stubborn.
[3524.48 --> 3527.42]  But now, see what I did there?
[3527.42 --> 3536.60]  But now, the gospel truth in Jesus Christ and explained by Paul in today's text shows us why that is.
[3536.94 --> 3542.54]  But more importantly today, it shows us a different way forward, a better way forward,
[3543.12 --> 3547.92]  a way that actually unites and invites positive change.
[3549.02 --> 3557.16]  The gospel truth of this text, the gospel truth of God's righteousness given to us transcends everything.
[3557.42 --> 3559.96]  It transcends race.
[3560.60 --> 3562.32]  It transcends status.
[3562.80 --> 3564.36]  It transcends ideologies.
[3565.60 --> 3571.38]  This righteousness given to us by God acknowledges that we are all the same.
[3572.78 --> 3574.18]  We are all sinners.
[3576.94 --> 3578.28]  We are all sinners.
[3579.08 --> 3580.60]  We are all in need of saving.
[3581.60 --> 3585.06]  And no one can attain a salvation by themselves by doing anything.
[3585.06 --> 3588.34]  We all need salvation.
[3588.52 --> 3590.28]  We all need righteousness from God.
[3590.34 --> 3592.56]  And that is beyond anything this world offers.
[3593.00 --> 3596.60]  We all need an alien righteousness, as reformers would call it.
[3596.90 --> 3601.80]  A righteousness for all people that comes from beyond this world.
[3602.24 --> 3607.02]  A righteousness we can only receive from God and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[3607.02 --> 3611.28]  And this righteousness is for all people.
[3612.28 --> 3623.08]  For Jew, Gentile, male, female, slave, free, or to modernize this up a bit, conservative, liberal, employer, employee, every race and culture under the sun.
[3623.08 --> 3625.46]  This righteousness is for you.
[3625.46 --> 3628.02]  And you receive it by faith in Jesus.
[3628.14 --> 3629.80]  For we are all the same in sin.
[3630.02 --> 3632.34]  And we are all the same in glory.
[3632.52 --> 3637.56]  And that's why this passage, which we are just about to look at a little bit more intensely, matters so much.
[3638.02 --> 3644.60]  Because the inclusivity that everyone desires so much in our culture is found in one place.
[3644.60 --> 3648.38]  The exclusivity of Christ's gospel.
[3649.16 --> 3651.18]  The exclusivity of Christ's righteousness.
[3651.54 --> 3656.98]  See, the exclusivity of Christ is the most inclusive doctrine humanity has.
[3658.12 --> 3668.50]  True unity, true equality can be found in him because Jesus gives us righteousness, which we receive through faith in him.
[3670.24 --> 3672.32]  Now, I got ahead of myself a little bit there.
[3672.52 --> 3673.68]  We're going to circle back to that.
[3674.60 --> 3679.32]  But for now, let's really dig into this text for a moment and really wrap our heads around all of this.
[3679.38 --> 3681.20]  There's a couple of questions that remain.
[3681.94 --> 3685.42]  First, what is this righteousness that matters so much?
[3686.80 --> 3692.36]  So righteousness, also called justification, is the idea of being made right in God's eyes.
[3692.84 --> 3694.96]  Receiving a clean slate from him.
[3695.08 --> 3699.22]  Knowing that we are spared his judgment for our sins.
[3699.22 --> 3709.84]  Justification is an instantaneous legal act of God in which he, one, sees our sins, past, present, and future, as forgiven.
[3710.60 --> 3716.36]  And two, declares us to be spotless in his sight because of Jesus Christ.
[3716.36 --> 3726.44]  So justified people have a new status, a new identity, a new family, and a new hope, ready to enjoy the new creation.
[3727.74 --> 3731.88]  It's rooted in God's undeserved favor given to us, to sinners.
[3732.02 --> 3732.80]  It's all grace.
[3733.00 --> 3734.82]  And it all comes from God.
[3734.82 --> 3740.38]  This is because salvation is granted apart from the law, verse 21 of our text.
[3740.70 --> 3743.58]  Because we could not achieve salvation by right living.
[3747.02 --> 3748.12]  So question number two.
[3748.36 --> 3753.84]  If we are so sinful, if humanity is so sinful, then how are we justified?
[3753.84 --> 3760.82]  Or better yet, how can our just God justify justifying us?
[3761.14 --> 3762.28]  That's a good question, isn't it?
[3762.68 --> 3767.98]  How can our just God justify justifying us?
[3768.86 --> 3772.92]  If God is just, and we are all sinners, how can we be saved?
[3773.66 --> 3775.28]  Verse 25 gives us that answer.
[3775.44 --> 3782.42]  God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement through the shedding of his blood to be received by faith.
[3782.42 --> 3784.98]  He did this to demonstrate his righteousness.
[3786.62 --> 3791.06]  So Christ, in his perfection or his righteousness, he shed his blood and he died.
[3791.50 --> 3792.72]  He was our sacrifice.
[3792.94 --> 3793.98]  He was our atonement.
[3794.26 --> 3799.60]  Jesus' death made people who believe at one with him.
[3799.94 --> 3800.44]  Atonement.
[3801.84 --> 3803.64]  That's what justification is.
[3803.68 --> 3806.62]  Or more theologically, propitiation is the word.
[3806.62 --> 3810.08]  That just means that God not only died to forgive our sins,
[3810.08 --> 3814.30]  but he died to bear God's wrath for us.
[3815.62 --> 3822.70]  God provided justice for the sins everyone committed by punishing his son in our place.
[3822.76 --> 3826.00]  Or put differently, the judge took the judgment.
[3828.10 --> 3830.80]  Now notice, God doesn't disrespect the law here.
[3830.86 --> 3832.60]  He doesn't do away with the law here.
[3832.60 --> 3837.02]  By Jesus taking on the punishments of all our sins, by bearing the wrath of God,
[3837.10 --> 3838.88]  it doesn't render the law useless.
[3839.58 --> 3841.66]  But it actually displays its importance.
[3841.92 --> 3846.58]  It's not that the Old Testament called people to live by obedience to the law,
[3846.62 --> 3849.18]  and then in the New Testament, God's like, eh, changed my mind.
[3849.24 --> 3849.62]  You know what?
[3849.66 --> 3850.82]  Let's just do faith now.
[3851.52 --> 3851.78]  No, no.
[3851.82 --> 3857.68]  The truth is, Christ followed the law perfectly to merit our salvation.
[3857.68 --> 3862.40]  It's not because we've obeyed it that we're saved, because Jesus did.
[3863.32 --> 3870.12]  He followed the law in his life, and then he bore God's wrath for our wrongdoing in his death.
[3870.70 --> 3872.60]  Jesus fulfilled the law.
[3873.02 --> 3873.94]  He didn't ignore it.
[3875.32 --> 3878.18]  And now, we're atoned for.
[3879.04 --> 3881.84]  We are made at one with God.
[3882.46 --> 3883.46]  We are righteous.
[3883.46 --> 3888.60]  We aren't simply forgiven from our sin, though that would be blessing enough.
[3888.72 --> 3888.88]  No?
[3889.76 --> 3890.14]  No.
[3890.64 --> 3897.42]  We are not only forgiven our sin, but we are made righteous in God's eyes.
[3898.12 --> 3898.96]  We are atoned for.
[3899.04 --> 3899.80]  We are justified.
[3900.06 --> 3906.44]  Christ's perfect life of obedience to the law allowed him to be the perfect atonement for our sins.
[3906.54 --> 3910.44]  And so, when he sacrificed his life, our sins have been forgiven.
[3910.44 --> 3915.16]  Not only that, but we've been made righteous, perfect, flawless in God's eyes.
[3915.60 --> 3920.00]  Verse 24, all are justified freely by his grace.
[3921.12 --> 3922.96]  Church, this is amazing news.
[3923.34 --> 3926.64]  Some of you might be hearing this for the first time, and I hope the weight of that sets in.
[3926.92 --> 3935.46]  Some of you have been hearing this for the thousandth time, and the danger is you're kind of almost immune to how miraculous and amazing that this is.
[3935.46 --> 3947.30]  But if we reject this news, if we reject the atonement, or at least if we're numb to the atonement, we are missing the greatest news in the world.
[3950.78 --> 3953.56]  Now, some might ask, why did all of this have to happen?
[3953.68 --> 3955.94]  Why did Jesus actually have to die for us?
[3955.94 --> 3960.00]  And the answer is actually somewhat simple, to be honest with you.
[3960.12 --> 3963.40]  Sin, the answer is sin needed punishing.
[3964.72 --> 3967.20]  God's wrath against sin had to happen.
[3968.54 --> 3972.04]  And if Jesus didn't bear that, then we would have had to.
[3972.86 --> 3974.76]  We would have had to bear that wrath.
[3974.88 --> 3976.34]  We would have had to bear that punishment.
[3976.88 --> 3980.90]  See, God couldn't simply save us from becoming indifferent to sin.
[3980.90 --> 3985.36]  God couldn't just simply become indifferent to sin to provide salvation for us.
[3986.02 --> 3991.98]  Because this would show no love to the victims who suffer the wrath of sin or abuse in this world.
[3992.12 --> 3996.10]  It would provide no justice for people crying out for it now.
[3996.44 --> 4000.42]  If God were indifferent to sin, there would be no assurance for the future either.
[4000.68 --> 4007.06]  Because what's assuring about a future where God reigns, but he's indifferent to sin, so sin reigns as well?
[4007.82 --> 4008.72]  That's not just.
[4008.80 --> 4009.86]  The bad guys just win.
[4010.90 --> 4018.50]  Also, God couldn't be indifferent towards sin because that would go against his very pure, perfect, and holy character.
[4019.10 --> 4020.14]  Our God is just.
[4021.20 --> 4023.08]  Therefore, sin needs to be punished.
[4024.58 --> 4031.62]  No, God didn't just set sin aside or become indifferent to sin or set justice to the side.
[4031.72 --> 4032.96]  What he did was more amazing.
[4033.90 --> 4035.64]  He turned justice on himself.
[4037.28 --> 4039.80]  Again, Christ didn't just suffer.
[4039.80 --> 4044.16]  He bore God's wrath in our place.
[4045.30 --> 4047.04]  And he chose to do this all along.
[4047.12 --> 4049.94]  This wasn't plan B to some failed plan A.
[4050.22 --> 4058.18]  Our living God, our living triune God, Father, Son, and Spirit planned this all along because God loves us.
[4058.18 --> 4061.68]  So what's beautiful is the cross.
[4061.68 --> 4067.38]  The cross doesn't compromise God's love or God's wrath.
[4067.38 --> 4075.18]  Both are expressed perfectly in what Christ did for us, which is what verse 26 of our text is saying.
[4075.18 --> 4078.58]  Tim Keller puts it this way.
[4078.58 --> 4079.38]  Tim Keller says,
[4079.38 --> 4084.08]  The cross satisfies the love of God and the justice of God.
[4084.46 --> 4093.80]  At the very same moment, it shows us that God is both the judge who cares enough about his world to set standards and hold us accountable to them,
[4093.80 --> 4101.62]  and the justifier who has done everything necessary to forgive and restore us.
[4103.08 --> 4109.26]  We are all made righteous in God's eyes because of Christ through faith alone.
[4109.26 --> 4112.52]  So then, question number three.
[4113.66 --> 4114.86]  What do we make of faith?
[4116.48 --> 4120.84]  Now, our text shows us a couple ways that faith plays itself out in our lives.
[4121.64 --> 4125.70]  First, the object of that faith is crucial.
[4127.00 --> 4129.14]  Verse 22 of our text says this quite clearly.
[4129.28 --> 4131.68]  This righteousness is given through faith.
[4132.06 --> 4132.52]  Faith where?
[4133.90 --> 4135.52]  Faith in Jesus Christ.
[4135.52 --> 4138.50]  The object of faith matters.
[4138.50 --> 4143.20]  It's not simply having faith that saves or even having faith in God that saves.
[4144.06 --> 4148.46]  It is faith in Jesus Christ's life, death, and resurrection that matters.
[4148.98 --> 4151.52]  It is this exclusive belief that matters.
[4151.96 --> 4153.84]  The object of faith is crucial here.
[4154.18 --> 4155.76]  Tim Keller also, he uses this example.
[4155.84 --> 4156.44]  I think this is awesome.
[4156.54 --> 4156.84]  He says,
[4157.26 --> 4159.10]  If I needed to cross the Pacific Ocean,
[4160.10 --> 4161.28]  if I needed to do this tomorrow,
[4161.28 --> 4167.90]  I could have all the faith in the world that duct-taping feathers to my arms will get me there.
[4169.64 --> 4172.38]  I could have faith the size of mountains,
[4172.50 --> 4180.16]  and I could believe wholeheartedly that flapping my arms with feathers taped to them would get me to Hawaii.
[4180.16 --> 4187.38]  But that faith, no matter how much I have, won't get me airborne because the object of that faith,
[4188.14 --> 4190.12]  the feathers on my arms will keep me grounded.
[4191.46 --> 4192.38]  That being said,
[4193.52 --> 4196.54]  even if I only had a small amount of faith,
[4196.82 --> 4200.58]  a tiny amount of faith in a Boeing 737,
[4201.44 --> 4205.10]  getting me across the Pacific Ocean, it would work.
[4205.34 --> 4206.26]  I could be worried.
[4206.44 --> 4207.42]  I could be fretting.
[4207.60 --> 4209.60]  I could be nervous that it wouldn't get off the ground.
[4209.60 --> 4212.22]  I could have such little faith that I would be terrified.
[4212.40 --> 4216.56]  But if I had a mustard seeds amount of faith that I got on that plane,
[4217.32 --> 4218.06]  it would get me there.
[4219.76 --> 4223.02]  It's not the faith that saves.
[4223.10 --> 4224.90]  It's not the faith that accomplishes.
[4225.16 --> 4227.28]  It's not the amount of faith that I had.
[4227.82 --> 4231.76]  It's what my faith was in that got me across the ocean.
[4232.10 --> 4234.96]  It's what our faith is in that saves us.
[4235.10 --> 4237.44]  Faith is the instrument where truth is revealed.
[4237.44 --> 4239.72]  The same is true with our salvation.
[4240.60 --> 4243.18]  It's not having faith that saves you.
[4243.44 --> 4244.98]  We have to get this right.
[4245.42 --> 4247.06]  It's not faith that saves you.
[4247.12 --> 4251.18]  If you think that you will be saved if you only believe in God hard enough,
[4251.18 --> 4254.58]  or if you only have more faith than you currently possess,
[4255.14 --> 4256.54]  then you're missing the point.
[4258.54 --> 4263.28]  If you're putting your faith in your ability to believe,
[4264.32 --> 4269.12]  or thinking that your salvation is dependent on your ability to have faith,
[4270.18 --> 4271.60]  guess what your faith is in?
[4271.60 --> 4272.60]  You.
[4272.60 --> 4273.60]  You.
[4274.42 --> 4275.66]  In your abilities.
[4275.86 --> 4277.60]  In your capabilities.
[4277.84 --> 4278.54]  In your capacities.
[4278.70 --> 4280.08]  This is crucial.
[4280.74 --> 4284.08]  Because if you come to think that your belief is the source of your forgiveness,
[4284.54 --> 4286.06]  or your salvation,
[4286.76 --> 4288.68]  you will stop looking at Christ,
[4289.82 --> 4291.48]  and you'll start looking within.
[4291.48 --> 4296.88]  When you see doubts, then, it'll start rattling you.
[4296.98 --> 4300.80]  When you don't feel faith quite as clearly, or maybe as excitedly,
[4300.96 --> 4303.26]  it will start to worry you and concern you.
[4304.48 --> 4306.84]  See, it's the object of our faith.
[4307.20 --> 4308.04]  It's Jesus.
[4308.56 --> 4309.80]  He's who saves you.
[4311.70 --> 4314.82]  Even faith as small as a mustard seed in the right object,
[4314.96 --> 4317.36]  in the gospel truth of Jesus Christ,
[4317.58 --> 4319.42]  will grant you salvation and righteousness.
[4319.42 --> 4321.84]  You don't need more faith.
[4322.14 --> 4323.80]  You just need Jesus.
[4324.38 --> 4325.42]  You need faith in Him.
[4326.48 --> 4327.02]  That's it.
[4327.32 --> 4327.82]  Salvation.
[4328.34 --> 4332.94]  Righteousness is given to us by Christ through faith.
[4334.46 --> 4336.18]  It's Christ who saves you.
[4336.90 --> 4337.72]  Not your abilities.
[4337.86 --> 4338.46]  Only Christ.
[4339.02 --> 4340.34]  And that leads us to the second point.
[4341.00 --> 4343.52]  The gift of faith in our life is just that.
[4344.56 --> 4345.50]  It's a gift.
[4346.52 --> 4349.08]  We've done nothing to contribute to our salvation.
[4349.08 --> 4351.66]  Except for our sin that we need saving from.
[4352.76 --> 4353.96]  It's only Jesus.
[4355.00 --> 4356.66]  And we touched on this at the beginning.
[4357.62 --> 4359.92]  And we're circling back to it now at the end here.
[4360.08 --> 4363.10]  But Jesus intervened to save us.
[4363.82 --> 4367.64]  We don't have to do anything to achieve this righteousness.
[4368.42 --> 4370.60]  It's to believe that Jesus gave it to us.
[4370.60 --> 4376.72]  Now this, this runs counter to everything.
[4378.40 --> 4378.76]  Everything.
[4378.98 --> 4379.56]  Think about it.
[4380.18 --> 4382.66]  When you want to play for the high school volleyball team,
[4383.18 --> 4386.56]  you go to a tryout, you show them what you're capable of doing,
[4386.62 --> 4388.20]  and you say to them, look what I can do.
[4389.00 --> 4389.68]  Accept me.
[4389.68 --> 4394.30]  When you apply to go to university, you submit your transcripts,
[4394.50 --> 4395.56]  you show them your grades,
[4395.64 --> 4398.74]  you tell them about all the extracurriculars that you have done in your life,
[4398.76 --> 4400.10]  and you say, look what I've done.
[4400.80 --> 4401.46]  Accept me.
[4403.12 --> 4405.26]  When you want a job, you show them your resume.
[4405.58 --> 4408.76]  You tell them of all the previous things that you've accomplished in your life,
[4408.80 --> 4410.94]  and you say to this, look at this, I'm qualified.
[4411.32 --> 4412.00]  Accept me.
[4412.00 --> 4416.12]  When you apply for a mortgage, you go to the bank,
[4416.44 --> 4419.56]  you show them your credit score, and give them your financial records,
[4419.62 --> 4420.80]  you say, look what I've managed.
[4421.18 --> 4421.96]  Accept me.
[4423.98 --> 4426.94]  This is true of every other religion as well.
[4427.88 --> 4431.52]  Obtaining different versions of salvation in every other religion
[4431.52 --> 4434.24]  all involves you showing what you've done.
[4435.88 --> 4438.20]  In Islam, you must follow the five pillars,
[4438.32 --> 4441.20]  including just living, pilgrimages, routine prayer, and fasting.
[4441.20 --> 4443.82]  That's how you obtain salvation in Islam.
[4444.08 --> 4447.30]  In Hinduism, you get reincarnated after death,
[4447.54 --> 4450.60]  and what you were reborn as depends on the enlightenment you attain
[4450.60 --> 4451.96]  here on this earth, in this world,
[4452.00 --> 4454.16]  which is obtained by doing worship,
[4454.52 --> 4458.30]  by gaining knowledge, and doing various acts and works.
[4458.42 --> 4461.94]  In Buddhism, you attain nirvana, or complete peace,
[4462.26 --> 4465.72]  by right speech, right conduct, right livelihood,
[4466.06 --> 4469.12]  and right effort, among other works and deeds.
[4469.12 --> 4472.98]  In Judaism, people are saved by studying the Torah
[4472.98 --> 4475.40]  and living their lives by its teaching
[4475.40 --> 4477.70]  and doing the works that it calls them to do.
[4477.96 --> 4484.28]  Even in this current post-Christian, atheist, pagan, pluralistic,
[4484.70 --> 4487.74]  secular humanist, dressed however you want to call it,
[4487.78 --> 4489.12]  culture that we live in today,
[4489.80 --> 4494.74]  the goal is to work and live for the social good for one another.
[4494.74 --> 4497.74]  That ultimate good comes from doing good things,
[4497.86 --> 4499.66]  from doing no harm to others.
[4500.40 --> 4503.30]  That means that every other religion and culture,
[4503.62 --> 4507.22]  you go to your God or your deity or whatever place,
[4507.26 --> 4508.84]  and you say, look what I've done.
[4509.76 --> 4511.60]  Look at the good things I've done,
[4511.86 --> 4512.86]  what I've accomplished.
[4513.06 --> 4514.60]  Look at the peace I've obtained,
[4514.80 --> 4516.88]  or the family with which I belong to,
[4517.02 --> 4519.18]  or the physical or spiritual record
[4519.18 --> 4521.86]  that I've done a pretty good job keeping out of the red.
[4521.86 --> 4523.46]  Look at who I am.
[4523.58 --> 4524.58]  Look at what I've done.
[4524.94 --> 4525.86]  Look at all of this.
[4526.14 --> 4527.00]  Accept me.
[4530.88 --> 4534.64]  But not Christian faith.
[4536.02 --> 4538.96]  Paul says, but now.
[4541.62 --> 4543.90]  Jesus intervenes.
[4546.30 --> 4549.28]  Righteousness is given to us.
[4549.28 --> 4551.72]  Apart from what we do,
[4553.18 --> 4555.60]  no other place offers this.
[4557.10 --> 4561.44]  Outside of the gospel truth of Christian faith,
[4562.16 --> 4564.38]  we must develop our own righteousness,
[4564.86 --> 4567.12]  or say, accept me and earn it.
[4567.92 --> 4569.18]  The gospel is different.
[4570.86 --> 4574.40]  It says that God has developed a perfect righteousness,
[4574.70 --> 4576.20]  and he offers it to you.
[4576.54 --> 4577.76]  He gives it to you.
[4577.76 --> 4581.08]  And by what Christ did,
[4581.36 --> 4583.18]  we are accepted.
[4584.44 --> 4587.14]  That is the uniqueness of the Christian gospel.
[4587.78 --> 4590.84]  Church, this is so compelling.
[4591.80 --> 4593.86]  I hope you see how important this is.
[4594.20 --> 4597.10]  Why Jesus changes everything.
[4598.92 --> 4601.84]  Why Jesus, living the perfect life
[4601.84 --> 4604.24]  that we've been called yet fail to live,
[4604.24 --> 4607.38]  and then Jesus died a death
[4607.38 --> 4609.04]  that we all deserve to die,
[4609.84 --> 4612.66]  only to raise up from the dead three days later,
[4612.76 --> 4614.54]  defeating sin and death forever.
[4616.06 --> 4617.66]  And Jesus ascended into heaven
[4617.66 --> 4619.54]  and is seated at the right hand of God
[4619.54 --> 4621.50]  right now, intervening on your behalf,
[4622.06 --> 4624.78]  and he saved you apart from everything you did.
[4624.78 --> 4631.20]  I pray you see how magnificently glorious that is,
[4631.76 --> 4633.94]  how freeing that is,
[4634.16 --> 4636.88]  how unique and amazing that is
[4636.88 --> 4639.82]  to every other belief system out there.
[4639.82 --> 4644.80]  Being a good person is not the goal of our faith.
[4644.92 --> 4647.26]  Doing good things is not the goal of the gospel.
[4647.42 --> 4649.60]  Salvation is not about us trying harder
[4649.60 --> 4650.70]  or doing more.
[4650.94 --> 4653.74]  It is about receiving God's grace
[4653.74 --> 4655.78]  and being transformed by it.
[4657.76 --> 4659.04]  Sometimes we forget this.
[4659.52 --> 4660.82]  Mike Bird, he highlights this.
[4660.86 --> 4661.40]  He says this.
[4661.46 --> 4661.78]  He says,
[4661.78 --> 4665.30]  In my short time as a follower of Jesus,
[4665.54 --> 4667.72]  I've had people tell me that in order to be saved,
[4667.98 --> 4669.04]  I need to speak in tongues,
[4669.52 --> 4670.92]  partake in some sacrament,
[4671.42 --> 4673.08]  only read the King James Bible,
[4673.74 --> 4675.36]  subscribe to a certain concession,
[4675.78 --> 4677.92]  believe in this diagram of the end times,
[4678.22 --> 4679.76]  jump through a dozen other hoops
[4679.76 --> 4681.94]  that seem to serve the purpose of validating
[4681.94 --> 4683.64]  the rantings of some lunatic
[4683.64 --> 4685.58]  with an opinion and a desperate desire
[4685.58 --> 4686.52]  to force it on others.
[4688.00 --> 4689.04]  Fortunately for me,
[4689.04 --> 4692.50]  I was well-discipled by Christian leaders
[4692.50 --> 4693.54]  and attended churches
[4693.54 --> 4694.82]  where the pastors were committed
[4694.82 --> 4695.80]  to biblical teaching,
[4695.80 --> 4697.90]  so I never got suckered in
[4697.90 --> 4701.78]  to the Jesus plus stairway to salvation.
[4702.70 --> 4704.62]  But sadly, many do.
[4707.22 --> 4710.70]  It's not Jesus plus that saves.
[4711.54 --> 4712.58]  Only Jesus.
[4714.14 --> 4715.30]  Verse 24 today,
[4715.30 --> 4719.56]  all are justified freely by His grace
[4719.56 --> 4723.48]  through the redemption that came by Jesus Christ.
[4724.98 --> 4725.90]  Hear that?
[4726.02 --> 4727.00]  All are justified.
[4727.80 --> 4729.32]  That is why this is possibly
[4729.32 --> 4732.02]  the most important paragraph ever written.
[4733.20 --> 4734.52]  This grace, this salvation,
[4734.70 --> 4736.38]  this righteousness is for everyone.
[4737.02 --> 4738.98]  The cross destroys discrimination.
[4739.38 --> 4741.94]  This righteousness is available to everyone,
[4742.04 --> 4742.86]  no matter their race,
[4743.10 --> 4744.00]  no matter their class,
[4744.00 --> 4745.52]  no matter their political leaning.
[4746.18 --> 4747.84]  This righteousness is yours
[4747.84 --> 4748.84]  if you have faith
[4748.84 --> 4751.08]  in who Jesus is
[4751.08 --> 4752.14]  and what Jesus did.
[4752.74 --> 4754.00]  No matter who you are,
[4754.52 --> 4755.56]  no matter what you've done.
[4755.70 --> 4756.60]  Are you a tax collector?
[4756.74 --> 4757.60]  I've got good news.
[4758.44 --> 4759.34]  Are you a prostitute?
[4759.46 --> 4760.36]  I've got good news.
[4761.30 --> 4762.24]  Addicted to drugs,
[4762.54 --> 4763.08]  or porn,
[4763.20 --> 4763.74]  or alcohol,
[4763.94 --> 4764.44]  or power?
[4764.64 --> 4765.60]  I've got good news.
[4766.56 --> 4767.96]  You ruled by greed?
[4768.38 --> 4769.42]  I've got good news.
[4770.34 --> 4772.24]  Married and divorced several times over?
[4772.24 --> 4773.12]  I've got good news.
[4773.12 --> 4776.90]  Constantly gossiping about your fellow colleagues?
[4777.00 --> 4777.68]  I've got good news.
[4778.92 --> 4779.98]  Envious of your neighbor?
[4780.68 --> 4781.72]  I've got good news.
[4782.76 --> 4784.48]  Sleeping with your boyfriend or girlfriend
[4784.48 --> 4785.14]  before marriage?
[4785.22 --> 4786.00]  I've got good news.
[4786.76 --> 4788.30]  Lying to cover your own pride?
[4788.38 --> 4789.18]  I've got good news.
[4789.46 --> 4791.28]  Hoarding your wealth for your own comfort?
[4791.40 --> 4792.24]  I've got good news.
[4793.50 --> 4795.88]  You can add anything to the list,
[4795.88 --> 4798.52]  but if any of that resonates with you,
[4798.58 --> 4800.40]  I've got good news.
[4800.84 --> 4802.58]  Jesus gives you righteousness,
[4802.58 --> 4805.06]  which you receive through faith in him.
[4805.70 --> 4807.66]  This righteousness for you,
[4807.88 --> 4809.26]  you have a clean slate
[4809.26 --> 4812.04]  if you have faith in Jesus' life,
[4812.12 --> 4812.86]  death, and resurrection.
[4813.36 --> 4814.74]  If you repent from what you did,
[4815.24 --> 4816.66]  you are never too far
[4816.66 --> 4818.58]  out of reach for the grace
[4818.58 --> 4819.96]  and the love of Jesus.
[4819.96 --> 4821.28]  Brothers and sisters,
[4821.48 --> 4823.02]  Jesus has good news for you.
[4823.06 --> 4823.22]  Amen?
[4824.74 --> 4825.14]  But,
[4826.24 --> 4827.88]  but,
[4828.24 --> 4831.74]  if any of that resonates with you,
[4832.74 --> 4834.60]  I've also got bad news.
[4835.74 --> 4837.10]  If you have faith
[4837.10 --> 4839.26]  and you receive this righteousness
[4839.26 --> 4840.48]  from Jesus Christ,
[4841.64 --> 4843.38]  everything's got to change.
[4843.38 --> 4847.16]  everything's got to change.
[4848.20 --> 4850.56]  This Christ-given righteousness
[4850.56 --> 4852.88]  changes everything.
[4854.54 --> 4855.76]  It changes you.
[4855.86 --> 4856.72]  It has to.
[4857.84 --> 4860.78]  Jesus bore the wrath of God
[4860.78 --> 4862.30]  so that you don't have to.
[4862.82 --> 4865.10]  He took on the punishment for your sin.
[4866.34 --> 4867.56]  You cannot accept that
[4867.56 --> 4869.52]  and then just think you can keep on sinning, right?
[4870.98 --> 4873.36]  Verse 31 of our text asks this question,
[4873.38 --> 4875.66]  do we then nullify the law?
[4876.74 --> 4878.40]  No, we don't nullify the law.
[4878.52 --> 4880.10]  We uphold the law.
[4881.40 --> 4883.32]  Again, this is the most important paragraph
[4883.32 --> 4884.00]  ever written.
[4884.62 --> 4886.52]  Everything boils down to righteousness
[4886.52 --> 4888.32]  given to us by Christ.
[4889.44 --> 4890.70]  If you accept this truth
[4890.70 --> 4892.06]  and know that Christ's life,
[4892.18 --> 4892.92]  death, and resurrection
[4892.92 --> 4894.16]  save you from your sin,
[4894.40 --> 4895.52]  you are forever free.
[4895.76 --> 4896.44]  You're liberated.
[4896.60 --> 4898.12]  The weight of sin and death
[4898.12 --> 4899.08]  is gone forever.
[4899.18 --> 4900.16]  That changes you.
[4900.46 --> 4901.32]  You are free.
[4901.32 --> 4904.54]  But it changes you.
[4904.54 --> 4907.92]  The truth changes
[4907.92 --> 4909.16]  how you live in this world.
[4909.38 --> 4911.16]  No more boasting in anything.
[4912.62 --> 4914.70]  But not I through Christ in me, right?
[4915.60 --> 4916.56]  Not your doing.
[4916.66 --> 4917.38]  It's God's doing.
[4918.50 --> 4919.76]  It changes how we talk.
[4920.08 --> 4920.84]  We're taking credit.
[4922.12 --> 4922.98]  We give God the glory
[4922.98 --> 4923.86]  whenever we can
[4923.86 --> 4925.78]  and we live humbly in this world.
[4925.78 --> 4927.78]  It changes how we live.
[4927.78 --> 4928.24]  It changes how we live
[4928.24 --> 4929.92]  to honor Him.
[4930.32 --> 4930.78]  And we're disobedient.
[4931.60 --> 4932.58]  We submit to Him.
[4932.80 --> 4933.80]  We obey Him.
[4934.96 --> 4938.06]  This is all verses 27 to 31 of our text.
[4939.10 --> 4940.58]  No matter who we are,
[4940.98 --> 4942.28]  no matter what we've done,
[4942.44 --> 4944.64]  we are unified as a body,
[4945.54 --> 4946.82]  handed righteousness
[4946.82 --> 4948.58]  for no reason of our own.
[4948.64 --> 4950.32]  He bore the wrath for you and me.
[4951.78 --> 4953.12]  If you've accepted this gift,
[4953.26 --> 4953.90]  praise God.
[4953.90 --> 4956.36]  If not, and you want to,
[4956.42 --> 4957.68]  you can come speak to me afterwards.
[4957.80 --> 4958.70]  You can speak to anybody
[4958.70 --> 4959.56]  wearing a name tag.
[4959.64 --> 4960.68]  You can call Pastor Chris.
[4960.74 --> 4961.78]  You can call up your elder.
[4964.18 --> 4965.74]  This gift is yours for the taking.
[4966.44 --> 4967.80]  Jesus wants to give you
[4967.80 --> 4968.56]  a clean slate.
[4968.64 --> 4969.70]  He's offering it to you
[4969.70 --> 4970.52]  for free.
[4972.10 --> 4973.34]  But it changes everything.
[4974.38 --> 4975.18]  And all you need to do
[4975.18 --> 4976.16]  is put your faith in Him.
[4977.58 --> 4977.90]  Amen.
[4977.90 --> 4978.04]  Amen.
[4978.64 --> 4979.22]  Let me pray.
[4983.90 --> 4986.36]  Father in heaven,
[4987.36 --> 4989.68]  you changed everything.
[4992.14 --> 4994.06]  God, in a world where we are called
[4994.06 --> 4994.84]  to do good
[4994.84 --> 4996.94]  for everyone else,
[4997.18 --> 4998.18]  where every other religion
[4998.18 --> 4999.86]  calls us to certain tasks
[4999.86 --> 5000.82]  and certain deeds
[5000.82 --> 5002.26]  and to accomplish certain things,
[5002.46 --> 5003.66]  in a world that asks us
[5003.66 --> 5004.70]  to give and do
[5004.70 --> 5006.18]  and be a part of everything,
[5006.50 --> 5007.56]  you change everything
[5007.56 --> 5010.98]  by saving us
[5010.98 --> 5013.70]  because of nothing we did.
[5016.60 --> 5018.16]  Lord, may we put our faith
[5018.16 --> 5020.36]  in what it is you have done
[5020.36 --> 5021.28]  and Jesus,
[5021.44 --> 5022.32]  who it is you are.
[5023.44 --> 5024.62]  May this change us
[5024.62 --> 5025.54]  to the core.
[5026.96 --> 5028.86]  May this gift of righteousness,
[5029.22 --> 5030.56]  this gift of salvation
[5030.56 --> 5033.00]  be more real to us today
[5033.00 --> 5034.00]  than it was yesterday.
[5034.68 --> 5035.50]  And may it change
[5035.50 --> 5037.10]  what tomorrow looks like for us
[5037.10 --> 5038.14]  and next week
[5038.14 --> 5039.76]  and every day of our lives
[5039.76 --> 5040.30]  going forward.
[5040.38 --> 5041.90]  May we not boast in anything,
[5042.32 --> 5044.08]  but may we live humbly for you.
[5044.80 --> 5045.84]  May the words that come
[5045.84 --> 5048.08]  out of our mouth glorify you.
[5049.46 --> 5051.36]  And may we live in obedience
[5051.36 --> 5052.58]  so that we can honor you,
[5053.36 --> 5053.92]  the God,
[5054.66 --> 5055.38]  the judge
[5055.38 --> 5057.72]  who bore our judgment.
[5060.56 --> 5061.52]  God, we thank you.
[5062.26 --> 5063.28]  We praise you.
[5064.20 --> 5065.28]  We sing to you.
[5065.56 --> 5066.54]  In your name, amen.
[5066.54 --> 5066.68]  Amen.
[5066.68 --> 5076.56]  Please stand with us.
[5076.56 --> 5077.00]  Amen.
[5083.00 --> 5088.26]  By faith we see the hand of God
[5088.26 --> 5094.24]  In the light of creation's grand design
[5094.24 --> 5099.00]  In the lives of those
[5099.00 --> 5103.48]  who prove his faithfulness
[5103.48 --> 5105.72]  Who walks by faith
[5105.72 --> 5109.48]  and not by sight
[5109.48 --> 5116.08]  By faith our fathers
[5116.08 --> 5118.62]  roam the earth
[5118.62 --> 5122.44]  With the power of his promise
[5122.44 --> 5126.04]  In their hearts
[5126.04 --> 5129.10]  Of a holy city
[5129.10 --> 5133.00]  Built by God's own hands
[5133.00 --> 5135.54]  A place where peace
[5135.54 --> 5137.68]  And justice spring
[5137.68 --> 5142.36]  We will stand as children
[5142.36 --> 5144.62]  Of the promise
[5144.62 --> 5149.02]  We will fix our eyes
[5149.02 --> 5149.86]  On him
[5149.86 --> 5152.34]  Our soul's reward
[5152.34 --> 5156.08]  Till the race is finished
[5156.08 --> 5160.30]  And the world is done
[5160.30 --> 5162.48]  We'll walk by faith
[5162.48 --> 5165.46]  And not by sight
[5165.46 --> 5172.92]  By faith the prophets
[5172.92 --> 5174.86]  Saw a day
[5174.86 --> 5179.26]  When the longed for Messiah
[5179.26 --> 5181.34]  Would appear
[5181.34 --> 5185.78]  With the power to break
[5185.78 --> 5189.42]  The chains of sin and death
[5189.42 --> 5192.66]  And rise triumphant
[5192.66 --> 5195.24]  From the rain
[5195.24 --> 5202.14]  By faith the church
[5202.14 --> 5204.22]  Was called to go
[5204.22 --> 5208.80]  In the power of the spirit
[5208.80 --> 5212.18]  To the lost
[5212.18 --> 5214.06]  To deliver
[5214.06 --> 5214.10]  To deliver
[5214.10 --> 5215.56]  Captives
[5215.56 --> 5217.16]  And to preach
[5217.16 --> 5218.84]  Good news
[5218.84 --> 5221.76]  In every corner
[5221.76 --> 5223.90]  Of the earth
[5223.90 --> 5226.98]  We will stand
[5226.98 --> 5228.28]  As children
[5228.28 --> 5230.40]  Of the promise
[5230.40 --> 5233.58]  We will fix
[5233.58 --> 5234.82]  Our eyes
[5234.82 --> 5235.58]  On him
[5235.58 --> 5238.08]  Our soul's reward
[5238.08 --> 5240.18]  Till the race
[5240.18 --> 5241.72]  Is finished
[5241.72 --> 5243.14]  And the work
[5243.14 --> 5245.78]  Is done
[5245.78 --> 5248.04]  We'll walk by faith
[5248.04 --> 5252.00]  And not by sight
[5252.00 --> 5258.14]  By faith the mountain
[5258.14 --> 5260.84]  Shall be used
[5260.84 --> 5264.76]  And the power of the gospel
[5264.76 --> 5266.50]  Shall prevail
[5266.50 --> 5269.46]  For we know
[5269.46 --> 5269.98]  For we know
[5269.98 --> 5271.16]  In Christ
[5271.16 --> 5271.96]  All things
[5271.96 --> 5274.10]  Are possible
[5274.10 --> 5277.66]  For all who call
[5277.66 --> 5280.40]  Upon his name
[5280.40 --> 5282.90]  We will stand
[5282.90 --> 5284.24]  As children
[5284.24 --> 5286.32]  Of the promise
[5286.32 --> 5289.46]  We will fix
[5289.46 --> 5290.72]  Our eyes
[5290.72 --> 5291.50]  On him
[5291.50 --> 5293.92]  Our soul's reward
[5293.92 --> 5295.46]  Till the race
[5295.46 --> 5297.46]  Is finished
[5297.46 --> 5298.84]  And the work
[5298.84 --> 5301.40]  Is done
[5301.40 --> 5303.46]  Till the race
[5303.46 --> 5304.46]  Is finished
[5304.46 --> 5305.46]  And the work
[5305.46 --> 5306.46]  Is done
[5306.46 --> 5307.46]  Till the race
[5307.46 --> 5308.46]  Is finished
[5308.46 --> 5309.46]  Till the race
[5309.46 --> 5310.46]  Is finished
[5310.46 --> 5310.52]  And the work
[5310.52 --> 5312.46]  Is done
[5312.46 --> 5314.46]  We'll walk by faith
[5314.46 --> 5315.46]  And not by sight
[5315.46 --> 5316.46]  We will stand
[5316.46 --> 5317.46]  As children
[5317.46 --> 5318.46]  Of the promise
[5318.46 --> 5319.46]  We will fix
[5319.46 --> 5320.46]  Our eyes
[5320.46 --> 5322.14]  Till the race
[5322.14 --> 5323.00]  Is finished
[5323.00 --> 5325.04]  And the work

[5332.00 --> 5346.02]  And so let us walk by faith
[5346.02 --> 5347.60]  As we go into this week

[5351.10 --> 5351.90]  Of righteousness
[5351.90 --> 5353.14]  And salvation
[5353.14 --> 5354.76]  The fact
[5354.76 --> 5355.30]  That you have
[5355.30 --> 5356.12]  A clean slate
[5356.12 --> 5357.18]  In God's eyes

[5371.38 --> 5372.44]  In the back foyer there
[5372.44 --> 5373.30]  I think someone

[5382.98 --> 5383.98]  And keep you
[5383.98 --> 5385.64]  The Lord make his face
[5385.64 --> 5386.68]  Shine upon you
[5386.68 --> 5388.14]  And be gracious to you
[5388.14 --> 5390.16]  The Lord turn his face
[5390.16 --> 5390.96]  Toward you
[5390.96 --> 5392.88]  And give you his peace
[5392.88 --> 5394.78]  And all God's people said
[5394.78 --> 5395.80]  Amen

[5422.88 --> 5424.34]  In my life
[5424.34 --> 5426.18]  And in my death
[5426.18 --> 5429.02]  You have fully paid

[5430.62 --> 5432.68]  And all my debt
[5432.68 --> 5435.56]  Even when I struggle

[5472.44 --> 5473.92]  In such a way
[5473.92 --> 5475.62]  That without you
[5475.62 --> 5479.50]  Not a hair can fall from me
[5479.50 --> 5482.06]  Unless you will it too
[5482.06 --> 5484.94]  Even when I'm lost
