[1226.72 --> 1228.72]  that
[1230.72 --> 1232.72]  you
[1232.72 --> 1248.96]  Even I don't see What Caroline
[1248.96 --> 1251.44]  still speaking
[1251.44 --> 1261.44]  When I don't feel it, you're working. You never stop, you never stop working. You never stop, you never stop working.
[1261.44 --> 1274.44]  Waymaker, miracle worker, promise keeper, light in the darkness, my God, that is who you are. You are.
[1274.44 --> 1297.44]  Waymaker, miracle worker, promise keeper, light in the darkness, my God, that is who you are. That is who you are. That is who you are. That is who you are.
[1301.44 --> 1302.56]  You may be seated.
[1304.44 --> 1317.70]  I picked a piece in Acts, just reflecting back on Pentecost, and Acts 2, 44 to 47.
[1318.30 --> 1324.68]  In the midst of all the miracles and wonders that the apostles were doing, this is what we read.
[1324.90 --> 1332.46]  All the believers were together and had everything in common. They sold properties and possessions to give to anyone who had need.
[1332.46 --> 1336.60]  Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts.
[1337.42 --> 1345.94]  They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people.
[1345.94 --> 1350.38]  And the Lord added to their numbers daily, those who were being saved.
[1350.38 --> 1366.58]  When I read that, when I see that kind of love that the early church had, it made me look and see that it's what a foundation, I think, of love and sacrifice to each other looks like,
[1366.58 --> 1370.58]  in a depth that only the Holy Spirit can give.
[1370.58 --> 1374.58]  I think Doreen and I have experienced that here in Emmanuel as well.
[1374.58 --> 1381.58]  A loving and sacrificing for each other, rooted in the love that only the Spirit can give.
[1381.58 --> 1391.24]  And I pray that as we continue in God's love, that he will help us to love those that he brings our way.
[1392.20 --> 1393.46]  Let's bow our heads.
[1395.64 --> 1400.08]  Father, we don't want to miss your love.
[1400.08 --> 1406.80]  Help us see through the counterfeit the world entices us with.
[1407.88 --> 1414.14]  Our first century brothers and sisters loved each other with a love only you could place in their hearts.
[1415.42 --> 1423.40]  Lord, will you continue to soften our hearts so we too can reflect your love to each other.
[1423.40 --> 1431.38]  And through the power of your Spirit, help us move within the power of your sacrificial love.
[1431.90 --> 1434.06]  To the praise of your glorious name.
[1434.60 --> 1434.86]  Amen.
[1435.62 --> 1438.04]  Why don't we rise as we sing a couple more songs.
[1453.40 --> 1471.22]  Everyone needs compassion.
[1472.22 --> 1474.64]  Love that's never failing.
[1476.52 --> 1481.40]  Let mercy fall on me.
[1481.40 --> 1484.30]  Everyone needs forgiveness.
[1485.44 --> 1487.72]  The kindness of the Savior.
[1489.72 --> 1493.26]  The hope of patience.
[1499.90 --> 1504.32]  Savior, you can live the mountains.
[1505.06 --> 1508.24]  My God is mighty to save.
[1508.58 --> 1511.38]  He is mighty to save.
[1511.40 --> 1512.68]  Forever.
[1512.68 --> 1512.72]  Forever.
[1512.72 --> 1513.30]  Forever.
[1513.30 --> 1516.50]  Author of salvation.
[1517.50 --> 1520.74]  He rose and conquered the grave.
[1521.08 --> 1523.76]  Jesus conquered the grave.
[1523.76 --> 1524.04]  Jesus conquered the grave.
[1524.04 --> 1524.70]  Jesus conquered the grave.
[1538.26 --> 1541.82]  So take me as you find me.
[1541.82 --> 1544.72]  All my fears and failures.
[1544.72 --> 1551.08]  And fill my life again
[1551.08 --> 1554.22]  I give my life to follow
[1554.22 --> 1558.44]  Everything I believe in
[1558.44 --> 1562.32]  Now I surrender
[1562.32 --> 1573.52]  Savior, He came through the mountains
[1573.52 --> 1577.14]  My God is mighty to save
[1577.14 --> 1580.48]  He is mighty to save
[1580.48 --> 1585.16]  Forever, author of salvation
[1585.16 --> 1589.30]  He rose and conquered the grave
[1589.30 --> 1593.26]  Jesus conquered the grave
[1593.26 --> 1598.06]  Shine a light and let the whole world sing
[1598.06 --> 1604.52]  We're singing for the glory of the risen King
[1604.52 --> 1610.26]  Jesus, shine a light and let the whole world sing
[1610.26 --> 1615.68]  We're singing for the glory of the risen King
[1615.68 --> 1622.52]  Savior, He can move the mountains
[1622.52 --> 1626.24]  My God is mighty to save
[1626.24 --> 1629.84]  He is mighty to save
[1629.84 --> 1634.48]  Forever, author of salvation
[1634.48 --> 1638.64]  He rose and conquered the grave
[1638.64 --> 1642.26]  Jesus conquered the grave
[1642.26 --> 1647.30]  Savior, He came through the mountains
[1647.30 --> 1651.00]  My God is mighty to save
[1651.00 --> 1654.26]  He is mighty to save
[1654.26 --> 1659.30]  Forever, author of salvation
[1659.30 --> 1663.52]  He rose and conquered the grave
[1663.52 --> 1667.14]  Jesus conquered the grave
[1667.14 --> 1669.14]  Jesus conquered the grave
[1669.14 --> 1674.68]  He is mighty to save
[1674.68 --> 1676.40]  He died and progressed in his hand
[1676.40 --> 1676.90]  Therefore, his blessed von hammam
[1676.90 --> 1678.90]  Jesus conquered the grave
[1678.90 --> 1679.34]  National enthusiasm
[1679.34 --> 1681.10]  Song nach
[1681.10 --> 1682.04]  He died
[1682.04 --> 1683.36]  He Zahl
[1683.36 --> 1686.60]  As the first version
[1686.60 --> 1689.60]  The present version
[1689.60 --> 1691.36]  Above 1 in the afterlife
[1691.36 --> 1706.46]  We are a moment, you are forever.
[1706.46 --> 1713.46]  Lord of the ages, God before time.
[1714.56 --> 1720.42]  We are a favor, you are eternal.
[1720.42 --> 1729.58]  Love everlasting, reigning on high.
[1730.04 --> 1735.52]  Holy, holy, Lord God almighty.
[1736.92 --> 1743.60]  Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
[1743.60 --> 1749.80]  Highest praises, honor and glory.
[1750.42 --> 1755.58]  Be unto your name.
[1757.58 --> 1761.58]  Be unto your name.
[1764.58 --> 1766.96]  We are the broken.
[1767.96 --> 1770.86]  You are the healer.
[1770.86 --> 1777.02]  Jesus, Redeemer, mighty to save.
[1778.02 --> 1781.30]  You are a love song.
[1781.72 --> 1784.10]  We'll sing forever.
[1785.14 --> 1788.02]  Bowing before you.
[1788.02 --> 1791.18]  Blessing your name.
[1791.18 --> 1793.18]  Blessing your name.
[1793.18 --> 1799.26]  Holy, holy, Lord God almighty.
[1799.26 --> 1806.42]  Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
[1806.42 --> 1813.58]  Highest praises, honor and glory.
[1813.58 --> 1818.74]  Be unto your name.
[1818.74 --> 1820.74]  Be unto your name.
[1820.74 --> 1824.74]  Be unto your name.
[1824.74 --> 1825.40]  Be unto your name.
[1825.40 --> 1825.74]  Be unto your name.
[1825.74 --> 1831.56]  Holy, holy, Lord God almighty.
[1831.56 --> 1832.88]  Lord God almighty.
[1832.90 --> 1838.90]  Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
[1838.90 --> 1846.06]  Highest praises, honor and glory.
[1846.06 --> 1848.06]  Be unto your name.
[1848.06 --> 1849.72]  Be unto your name.
[1849.72 --> 1852.40]  Be unto your name.
[1852.40 --> 1859.40]  Be unto your name
[1859.40 --> 1865.40]  Be unto your name
[1865.40 --> 1868.48]  Be invited, be seated.
[1882.40 --> 1889.40]  Be seated.
[1889.40 --> 1893.40]  Good morning. My name is Emo and I'm a deacon in the church.
[1893.40 --> 1897.40]  We continue our worship this morning with the giving of our gifts.
[1897.40 --> 1903.40]  First of all for the budget which covers the administration of the church and its ministries
[1903.40 --> 1911.40]  and the special offering which is for the chaplain and refugee support mobilizer
[1911.40 --> 1915.40]  who is locally Dina Nikolai.
[1915.40 --> 1920.40]  She ministers out of the First Christian Reformed Church of Vancouver
[1920.40 --> 1937.40]  and her role is to provide a ministry of presence and neighborhood welcome for refugees during the time they are living at or accessing services at the Immigrant Service Society of BC Welcome Center
[1937.40 --> 1949.40]  to support their integration into the communities into which they are moving and mobilize local congregations to partner in this integration support.
[1949.40 --> 1953.40]  As for God, His way is perfect.
[1953.40 --> 1955.40]  The Lord's word is flawless.
[1955.40 --> 1958.40]  He shields all who take refuge in Him.
[1958.40 --> 1961.40]  Psalm 18 verse 30.
[1961.40 --> 1966.40]  Next week's offering is for the budget and Open Doors Canada.
[1966.40 --> 1977.40] מה is uniquementだ
[1977.40 --> 1979.40]  It's all part of the public, most of us in the SYCAVs that would control the Ohio River and the Pontiac community.
[1979.40 --> 1981.40]  What do we do are the major need to support our leaders when providing aid?
[1981.40 --> 1994.32]  No place I'd rather be
[1994.32 --> 1998.28]  No place I'd rather be
[1998.28 --> 2002.54]  Than here in your love, here in your love
[2002.54 --> 2006.20]  No place I'd rather be
[2006.20 --> 2010.34]  No place I'd rather be
[2010.34 --> 2014.18]  No place I'd rather be
[2014.18 --> 2018.66]  Than here in your love, here in your love
[2018.66 --> 2022.84]  So set a fire down in my soul
[2022.84 --> 2026.86]  That I can't contain, that I can't control
[2026.86 --> 2030.70]  I want more of you, God
[2030.70 --> 2034.74]  I want more of you, God
[2034.74 --> 2038.94]  So set a fire down in my soul
[2038.94 --> 2042.78]  That I can't contain, that I can't control
[2042.78 --> 2046.62]  I want more of you, God
[2046.62 --> 2050.46]  I want more of you, God
[2050.46 --> 2056.30]  No place I'd rather be
[2056.30 --> 2070.14]  No place I'd rather be
[2070.14 --> 2074.08]  No place I'd rather be
[2074.08 --> 2077.96]  No place I'd rather be
[2077.96 --> 2082.46]  Than here in your love, here in your love
[2082.46 --> 2086.30]  I want more of you, God
[2086.30 --> 2088.30]  So set a fire down in my soul
[2088.30 --> 2090.78]  That I can't contain, that I can't control
[2090.78 --> 2098.68]  I want more of you God, and I want more of you God.
[2099.42 --> 2106.94]  So set a fire down in my soul that I can contain, that I can control.
[2107.56 --> 2114.78]  I want more of you God, and I want more of you God.
[2120.78 --> 2150.76]  I want more of you God.
[2150.76 --> 2163.98]  We are really excited to welcome a number of people into a full covenant and familial relationship with our church here at Emmanuel.
[2164.56 --> 2170.14]  Some of the people that we are welcoming this morning are new believers who were baptized as infants,
[2170.28 --> 2176.82]  but have come to a personal faith and relationship to Jesus for the first time in these last months.
[2176.82 --> 2185.98]  Some are joining our church family from other churches in the region, and others are transferring from other Christian Reformed churches.
[2187.12 --> 2191.30]  To begin, we're going to welcome Rose Vita to the front.
[2191.72 --> 2195.28]  And John and Margaret, are you both coming up with her?
[2195.28 --> 2205.56]  As Rose Vita makes her way to the front, all the way back in her baptism as an infant, God extended a promise to her.
[2206.26 --> 2212.20]  Today, she makes that promise real by professing a faith that she has made her own.
[2212.20 --> 2219.10]  We're going to hear a little bit of Rose Vita's story from her, and then a little bit from John and Margaret as well,
[2219.24 --> 2222.04]  before we go forward with our profession of faith.
[2222.04 --> 2227.78]  Good morning.
[2231.78 --> 2244.24]  I met John about three, almost four months ago, and it was one of the lowest days of my life.
[2244.24 --> 2260.10]  And he just read it all over me, and he came up to me, and he asked how I was doing, and he asked me if I wanted a hug.
[2260.76 --> 2269.06]  And he just gave me this hug that was just electric, like the energy that came through that hug.
[2269.06 --> 2275.74]  It just lit me right up, and then he invited me to church.
[2276.46 --> 2288.20]  And when I walked in, it was like I was home, and that I had a new family.
[2288.20 --> 2308.08]  And my whole body was just shaking inside, and I was crying with elation just from the movement of the Holy Spirit and the love of God and Jesus.
[2308.84 --> 2314.52]  And I was a changed person after that.
[2314.52 --> 2319.40]  And I'm going to start crying again, but with happiness.
[2319.92 --> 2328.96]  I'm just such a different person because of this wonderful experience.
[2328.96 --> 2347.78]  And I'm just looking forward to every day sharing, embracing the love of God and Jesus and sharing his words and getting to know more people.
[2347.78 --> 2355.92]  I wrote down from Psalms, just what sums it up.
[2357.06 --> 2365.76]  I will say of the Lord, he is my refuge and my fortress, my God in whom I trust.
[2366.50 --> 2368.00]  I am home.
[2368.98 --> 2370.04]  And that sums it up.
[2370.74 --> 2371.20]  Thank you.
[2377.78 --> 2381.36]  Boy, how do I follow up with that?
[2384.54 --> 2384.98]  Yeah.
[2385.40 --> 2388.42]  Like, yeah, that day, yeah, we were at the food bank.
[2388.84 --> 2394.56]  And I remember seeing you for the first time, and I helped you there.
[2394.98 --> 2400.62]  And I just knew that I could see it, that your heart was broken.
[2400.62 --> 2408.96]  And so, yeah, we started a conversation, and you told me a bit of your life story.
[2410.00 --> 2413.02]  Like, you lost your parents, your siblings were gone.
[2413.96 --> 2415.96]  You had no children, so you felt so lonely.
[2416.44 --> 2421.38]  And I remember saying to you, I remember clearly saying to you at that time,
[2422.06 --> 2423.82]  Rose Vita, you need a family so bad.
[2425.00 --> 2426.86]  And I knew just the family she needed.
[2426.86 --> 2431.56]  And that's when I invited you to church, that Sunday.
[2432.06 --> 2441.28]  And, yeah, Margo and I have just been watching you like a sponge, just soaking it all in.
[2441.40 --> 2443.58]  Like the gospel was just speaking to you.
[2444.34 --> 2448.10]  You loved all the songs that we sang, and you loved the fellowship here.
[2449.10 --> 2452.14]  And as the weeks went by, you just kept growing and growing.
[2452.14 --> 2457.14]  And I kept telling you the whole time, man, the Spirit is doing a great job.
[2457.34 --> 2459.32]  And he's working in you like so bad.
[2459.46 --> 2461.02]  It's so exciting to watch.
[2462.06 --> 2467.60]  And anyway, I could say a whole lot more.
[2467.92 --> 2471.46]  But, yeah, we shared the gospel together.
[2471.46 --> 2478.94]  We studied certain passages, and that passage you just read, that was the very first passage I gave to you.
[2479.32 --> 2483.08]  And, yeah, I said, yeah, keep that in your heart always.
[2483.60 --> 2485.70]  So, anyway, that's it.
[2485.70 --> 2492.38]  Thank you, John and Mark.
[2492.42 --> 2495.50]  You guys can, if you want to just sit here for a minute.
[2495.66 --> 2497.96]  Well, Roseveed, I'm going to ask you a few questions before you go sit.
[2501.56 --> 2504.58]  So, when we do Professions of Faith here, we start this way.
[2504.78 --> 2509.22]  Because it's so good for us to hear stories of God at work in the world.
[2510.08 --> 2510.30]  Right?
[2510.30 --> 2514.04]  For some of us, we haven't seen that happen in so long.
[2514.54 --> 2517.34]  This is such a good reminder.
[2517.54 --> 2524.28]  And so, we are encouraged by your story, your testimony, and by the fact that we get to share that with you this morning.
[2524.94 --> 2527.60]  I'm going to ask you four questions.
[2528.24 --> 2531.58]  And then at the end of the questions, I'll invite you to give one answer for all four.
[2532.00 --> 2534.54]  You can say, I do with God's help.
[2535.00 --> 2536.48]  With God's love and God's help.
[2536.62 --> 2537.42]  All of the above.
[2537.42 --> 2541.76]  Here, and I'll give you this so everyone can hear your answer.
[2543.32 --> 2543.76]  Roseveeda.
[2544.72 --> 2549.00]  Do you believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God sent to redeem the world?
[2549.72 --> 2553.64]  Do you love and trust Him as the one who saves you from your sin?
[2553.94 --> 2557.68]  And do you, with repentance and joy, embrace Him as the Lord of your life?
[2558.68 --> 2558.96]  Two.
[2559.62 --> 2563.86]  Do you believe that the Bible is the Word of God revealing Christ and His redemption?
[2563.86 --> 2568.28]  And that the confessions of this church faithfully reflect this revelation?
[2569.44 --> 2569.62]  Three.
[2570.36 --> 2574.58]  Do you accept the gracious promises of God sealed to you in your baptism?
[2574.96 --> 2580.16]  And do you affirm your union with Christ and His church, which your baptism signifies?
[2580.92 --> 2581.44]  And four.
[2581.44 --> 2588.78]  Do you promise to do all that you can with the help of the Holy Spirit to strengthen your love and commitment to Christ
[2588.78 --> 2595.04]  by sharing faithfully in the life of this church family, honoring and submitting to its authority?
[2595.04 --> 2600.66]  And do you join with the people of God in doing the work of the Lord everywhere?
[2601.28 --> 2602.76]  Roseveeda, what is your answer?
[2603.48 --> 2605.12]  I do with God's help.
[2605.58 --> 2605.88]  Amen.
[2606.92 --> 2607.44]  Amen.
[2607.44 --> 2607.64]  Amen.
[2607.64 --> 2607.68]  Amen.
[2607.68 --> 2607.70]  Amen.
[2607.70 --> 2607.74]  Amen.
[2607.74 --> 2607.76]  Amen.
[2607.76 --> 2607.84]  Amen.
[2611.44 --> 2612.00]  Amen.
[2614.00 --> 2614.12]  Amen.
[2614.12 --> 2614.36]  Amen.
[2622.36 --> 2624.30]  Amen.
[2631.30 --> 2635.32]  Amen.
[2635.32 --> 2636.30]  Amen.
[2636.30 --> 2636.76]  Amen.
[2636.76 --> 2637.74]  Amen.
[2637.76 --> 2640.36]  Amen.
[2640.36 --> 2640.92]  Amen.
[2640.94 --> 2641.38]  Amen.
[2641.38 --> 2641.40]  Amen.
[2641.40 --> 2641.42]  Amen.
[2641.42 --> 2645.68]  and may he work in you what is pleasing to him through Jesus Christ,
[2645.78 --> 2648.32]  to whom be glory forever and ever.
[2648.62 --> 2649.48]  All God's people said?
[2650.26 --> 2650.74]  Amen.
[2651.64 --> 2653.92]  I want to invite John Skipper to come to the front.
[2654.02 --> 2655.72]  He's an elder in our church.
[2655.78 --> 2658.22]  We have a little gift to mark this day for you.
[2671.42 --> 2673.96]  Excellent. Now you may have a seat for just a few moments.
[2677.78 --> 2682.04]  We also want to take some time this morning to welcome a few others
[2682.04 --> 2684.40]  who are coming to us from different area churches.
[2684.68 --> 2686.94]  And so, Leslie, are you here?
[2689.00 --> 2691.34]  There you are. Excellent. Come on to the front, Leslie.
[2691.34 --> 2691.44]  Leslie.
[2694.64 --> 2699.18]  Leslie Stewart comes to us from Bradner Presbyterian Church
[2699.18 --> 2702.60]  and actually first connected with us here at Emanuel
[2702.60 --> 2704.38]  through the Coffee Break ministry.
[2705.16 --> 2709.34]  She's been participating in that ministry for coming on the year now, right?
[2710.02 --> 2712.58]  Six months. Yeah, feels like a year sometimes, right?
[2714.00 --> 2717.62]  And then has been worshiping with us for these past few months as well.
[2718.54 --> 2723.20]  Leslie, it is our hope and prayer that your faith in God will be strengthened,
[2723.48 --> 2725.62]  that your love for Jesus will be grown,
[2725.62 --> 2729.62]  and that here you will find opportunity to serve in the Spirit
[2729.62 --> 2733.40]  as you join with us on mission with God to the community.
[2734.04 --> 2737.02]  As we welcome you into this church family, similarly,
[2737.24 --> 2740.04]  we're going to ask you to affirm the faith that you have professed
[2740.56 --> 2743.96]  and your commitment to God's mission in and through Langley Emanuel
[2743.96 --> 2747.42]  to our city, to our region, and to the world.
[2747.90 --> 2750.24]  And so to do so, I'm going to ask you three questions
[2750.24 --> 2754.14]  and then invite you to give the same response I do with God's help.
[2759.46 --> 2763.16]  So Leslie, do you believe in Jesus as your Savior and Lord
[2763.16 --> 2767.22]  and that in Him only is hope and freedom from sin found?
[2768.22 --> 2770.78]  Do you believe that the Bible is the Word of God
[2770.78 --> 2773.76]  revealing His plan for redemption in Jesus Christ?
[2774.26 --> 2778.32]  The preaching and teaching of this church, Langley Emanuel, reflect that truth.
[2778.32 --> 2782.30]  And then three, do you promise with the help of the Holy Spirit
[2782.30 --> 2785.38]  to do all you can to strengthen your relationship to Jesus
[2785.38 --> 2788.14]  by being a part of the life of this church,
[2788.62 --> 2790.48]  recognizing its oversight and authority
[2790.48 --> 2793.98]  and joining with us on mission for Jesus in this community,
[2794.28 --> 2796.26]  in this city, and to the world?
[2796.90 --> 2798.42]  Leslie, what is your answer?
[2798.86 --> 2800.04]  I do with God's help.
[2800.66 --> 2801.78]  Amen. Amen.
[2802.66 --> 2804.92]  I'm just going to get you to stand over here for just a moment.
[2804.92 --> 2805.08]  Thank you.
[2808.32 --> 2813.90]  And now we also want to welcome into our church fellowship
[2813.90 --> 2815.74]  some people who have come to us,
[2816.06 --> 2818.08]  some who have been here for a little while now,
[2818.20 --> 2820.02]  from other Christian Reformed churches.
[2820.54 --> 2823.70]  And so I'm going to invite Tim and Janet to come forward
[2823.70 --> 2826.04]  and if your kids are here with you,
[2827.00 --> 2828.18]  Tim and Janet, are you here?
[2828.32 --> 2828.88]  There we go.
[2829.38 --> 2831.34]  Ryan, Micah, and Casey, if you're all here,
[2831.34 --> 2833.60]  if only a few of you are here, just come on up.
[2833.60 --> 2838.06]  And then as well, Angela Wolfe up to the front.
[2839.70 --> 2841.62]  I don't think Miranda's here with you today.
[2841.76 --> 2841.92]  No.
[2843.76 --> 2847.34]  So the Van Hemerts come to us from Willoughby CRC
[2847.34 --> 2850.88]  and Angela comes to us from New West CRC.
[2851.58 --> 2854.72]  We are grateful that you also are with us
[2854.72 --> 2859.60]  and we are excited to see what God will do in our midst through you.
[2859.60 --> 2863.74]  Our prayer is that you will join our shared mission and ministry
[2863.74 --> 2866.92]  as a church family and in some cases as you already have,
[2867.12 --> 2868.14]  and we're grateful for that,
[2868.52 --> 2871.30]  by serving God in Murrayville, Langley, and beyond
[2871.30 --> 2873.68]  and by together proclaiming his gospel,
[2873.96 --> 2877.34]  revealing his kingdom come and his kingdom coming.
[2877.72 --> 2878.98]  Thank you for being with us.
[2879.44 --> 2882.74]  Our prayer is that you will find the love of God here.
[2883.24 --> 2884.24]  Let's welcome them together.
[2884.24 --> 2893.88]  And now, congregation, I'm going to invite you
[2893.88 --> 2897.76]  to have a chance to promise your blessing and support too.
[2897.92 --> 2900.36]  And so, Rosita, if you're able, can you just join us up front?
[2901.40 --> 2904.94]  That way everyone can see, but more importantly, you can see them.
[2905.88 --> 2907.50]  And so, congregation, I'm going to invite you to stand,
[2907.60 --> 2910.54]  if you're able, and to answer this question
[2910.54 --> 2914.06]  we do with God's help.
[2915.22 --> 2918.56]  Church family of Langley, Emanuel, people of God gathered here,
[2918.72 --> 2920.78]  seeing all these people in front of you
[2920.78 --> 2924.38]  and hearing in them stories of God's faithfulness,
[2924.46 --> 2926.38]  I invite you to answer this question
[2926.38 --> 2929.22]  in response to God's call.
[2929.90 --> 2931.24]  Do you, people of God,
[2931.40 --> 2934.26]  promise all these wonderful people up here
[2934.26 --> 2937.02]  your love, encouragement, and prayers?
[2937.02 --> 2938.02]  Amen.
[2941.48 --> 2941.80]  Amen.
[2942.10 --> 2943.04]  Go ahead and have a seat.
[2943.90 --> 2945.76]  I'm going to invite Pastor Kevin to come up to the front.
[2946.56 --> 2948.18]  He's going to pray over you guys.
[2948.96 --> 2950.88]  I'm also going to invite elders,
[2951.54 --> 2954.06]  church members, family, friends
[2954.06 --> 2956.10]  who are here and want to lay hands on
[2956.10 --> 2957.02]  during this time.
[2957.56 --> 2959.30]  You're encouraged to do that.
[2960.02 --> 2961.44]  So gather up and around,
[2961.64 --> 2963.30]  pick someone, put your hand on them.
[2964.14 --> 2965.82]  Pastor Kevin is going to pray.
[2965.82 --> 2984.20]  Let's bow our heads.
[2985.56 --> 2988.56]  Father in heaven, what a beautiful day it is today.
[2988.86 --> 2991.54]  We thank you for your church family, Lord,
[2991.60 --> 2993.66]  and we thank you that you have called us all
[2993.66 --> 2995.96]  to be the body of Christ, brothers and sisters
[2995.96 --> 2999.60]  who declare your name and proclaim it to the nations.
[3000.04 --> 3003.64]  Lord, we thank you for these wonderful people
[3003.64 --> 3005.52]  who stood up here, for Rosvita,
[3006.08 --> 3008.92]  proclaiming your name, professing her faith in you,
[3008.98 --> 3012.56]  and joining the body, joining her new family
[3012.56 --> 3014.98]  in front of all of those gathered here today
[3014.98 --> 3015.92]  and in front of your spirit.
[3016.46 --> 3018.96]  We thank you for Leslie and for Angela
[3018.96 --> 3020.94]  and for the Van Hemert family as well, God,
[3021.02 --> 3023.88]  who are part of this family as well.
[3024.52 --> 3026.36]  And Lord, as we go forward from here,
[3027.46 --> 3029.28]  unified in the body of Christ,
[3030.38 --> 3032.90]  may we all discern your spirit
[3032.90 --> 3037.18]  and may we all be encouraged and convicted
[3037.18 --> 3039.54]  to be there for one another,
[3039.84 --> 3041.18]  to pray for one another,
[3041.44 --> 3043.10]  to lift up one another,
[3043.10 --> 3047.02]  and to proclaim your name to the community around us.
[3048.54 --> 3050.10]  God, we thank you for the church.
[3052.10 --> 3053.32]  We pray this in your name.
[3053.66 --> 3053.86]  Amen.
[3073.10 --> 3077.72]  At this time, I'd like to invite all the children up
[3077.72 --> 3079.00]  for children's worship time.
[3095.16 --> 3097.14]  Good morning, kids.
[3098.38 --> 3099.70]  I'm going to say good morning again.
[3099.80 --> 3100.96]  You guys are going to say good morning back,
[3101.02 --> 3101.90]  but nice and loud, right?
[3102.30 --> 3102.98]  Good morning.
[3103.38 --> 3104.12]  Good morning.
[3104.56 --> 3104.92]  Nice.
[3105.68 --> 3107.14]  This morning, we're going to talk,
[3107.20 --> 3108.30]  we're talking about patience.
[3108.46 --> 3110.32]  Does anyone in this group right here
[3110.32 --> 3111.94]  know anything about the word patience?
[3112.30 --> 3113.02]  Do you know what it means?
[3113.16 --> 3113.70]  What do you think?
[3116.20 --> 3117.70]  Waiting for your turn to do something?
[3117.84 --> 3118.42]  Yeah, how about you?
[3119.76 --> 3120.04]  Waiting.
[3120.50 --> 3121.24]  Anybody else?
[3126.92 --> 3128.48]  Waiting to go to a good fancy party.
[3128.58 --> 3128.98]  That's true.
[3129.92 --> 3131.32]  If you could put the first slide up.
[3131.32 --> 3132.56]  I got a couple pictures up here.
[3132.56 --> 3134.20]  Does anybody know what that thing is?
[3134.20 --> 3137.24]  So do you have to have a little bit of patience
[3137.24 --> 3139.56]  when you watch the sand go through that?
[3140.12 --> 3141.84]  Sometimes it can be a long time,
[3142.06 --> 3143.28]  and you have to be really patient.
[3143.78 --> 3144.60]  How about the next one?
[3144.60 --> 3145.84]  Oh.
[3145.84 --> 3149.08]  Anybody have like an iPad or something like that,
[3149.08 --> 3149.86]  and you're waiting,
[3150.00 --> 3151.44]  and that thing, the battery went dead,
[3151.46 --> 3152.18]  and you got to wait?
[3152.76 --> 3153.82]  Does that feel like forever?
[3153.94 --> 3154.76]  Or your watch?
[3156.20 --> 3157.06]  Sometimes it's fast.
[3157.06 --> 3157.84]  How about the next one?
[3157.84 --> 3157.86]  How about the next one?
[3158.90 --> 3159.24]  Oh.
[3159.34 --> 3161.74]  What if you had to ride a snail somewhere?
[3161.98 --> 3164.02]  Would that take a lot of patience getting somewhere?
[3164.56 --> 3164.92]  Yeah.
[3165.64 --> 3166.74]  How about the next one?
[3167.70 --> 3168.10]  Puzzles.
[3168.74 --> 3170.16]  Do puzzles take patience?
[3170.86 --> 3171.22]  Yeah.
[3171.88 --> 3174.16]  And the last one is, oh.
[3174.32 --> 3175.86]  How about a plant to grow?
[3176.24 --> 3177.58]  Maybe you got a garden at home,
[3177.64 --> 3178.80]  and you're trying to grow some vegetables,
[3178.92 --> 3180.64]  and sometimes it feels like it takes forever.
[3180.64 --> 3181.04]  Yeah.
[3182.70 --> 3183.06]  Yeah.
[3183.22 --> 3184.10]  You got to have a lot of patience.
[3184.36 --> 3187.86]  So today we're going to talk about patience in the back there,
[3188.00 --> 3189.20]  but before we do that,
[3189.26 --> 3190.58]  we're going to stand up and do the blessing.
[3190.70 --> 3191.20]  Can we do that?
[3191.62 --> 3192.42]  Where is that?
[3192.70 --> 3193.02]  Puppet.
[3193.60 --> 3194.76]  You can follow everybody.
[3194.98 --> 3195.30]  Yeah.
[3195.66 --> 3196.28]  Ready, guys?
[3196.44 --> 3197.04]  Where's the puppet?
[3197.96 --> 3198.48]  The.
[3199.32 --> 3200.90]  Lord be with you.
[3201.44 --> 3202.70]  And also with you.
[3210.64 --> 3240.62]  Thank you.
[3240.64 --> 3241.26]  Thank you.
[3245.08 --> 3247.86]  Before I lead you in prayer,
[3247.98 --> 3251.22]  I just want to go over some notes I have.
[3252.06 --> 3256.68]  I prefer to mention people's names and issues we pray for
[3256.68 --> 3259.46]  rather than having my eyes open when I pray.
[3259.60 --> 3261.82]  I guess at a young age I was taught
[3261.82 --> 3263.66]  that you should close your eyes when you pray.
[3263.98 --> 3266.62]  So that's what I do most of the time.
[3266.62 --> 3267.62]  Thank you.
[3267.62 --> 3268.62]  Thank you.
[3268.62 --> 3271.84]  An update from Joanne Miles' mom this morning.
[3272.00 --> 3273.86]  Joanne said she's doing better,
[3274.86 --> 3276.34]  so we're thankful for that.
[3276.34 --> 3281.54]  Tini Freend, mother of Brenda, Linda, and Jody,
[3281.64 --> 3285.60]  and I understand Jody and her son is here.
[3286.72 --> 3287.66]  So welcome.
[3288.32 --> 3292.80]  Tini has continues to recover from her infection,
[3292.80 --> 3295.34]  and we praise God for answered prayer,
[3295.54 --> 3297.56]  but she is not out of the woods yet.
[3299.38 --> 3302.60]  Ellen White is in Delta Hospital recovering from a fall,
[3302.60 --> 3308.08]  and it was found out yesterday that she could be there for six to seven weeks.
[3308.36 --> 3311.22]  Initially, the thought was five or six days.
[3311.66 --> 3314.78]  So please continue to pray for Ellen.
[3314.78 --> 3319.34]  Also, Elise Wagner, she's going through tests and treatments,
[3319.96 --> 3321.08]  and pray for full healing.
[3322.60 --> 3329.48]  And I want to just focus on the members who just joined or did profession of faith.
[3330.46 --> 3333.06]  And Rose Vita, I'm going to leave you for last, if that's okay.
[3333.06 --> 3340.70]  Leslie Stewart, Tim, Janet, Vern Hemert, and their children, Angela and their children.
[3341.74 --> 3348.80]  Tim, your father was a Maine pastor, I guess you would call it.
[3348.94 --> 3353.58]  He used to say he had many good clients in Glen Valley,
[3353.68 --> 3356.02]  and I was one of the clients in Glen Valley.
[3356.02 --> 3364.68]  And his prayers and his patience and his sharing was just awesome.
[3365.96 --> 3368.62]  Rose Vita, welcome to us.
[3370.68 --> 3372.04]  Today is a high.
[3373.62 --> 3377.80]  Maybe tomorrow is not as high, but God is always there.
[3378.34 --> 3379.90]  Jesus is always there.
[3380.48 --> 3384.02]  Always can reach out to them, always listening, and that's so awesome.
[3386.02 --> 3388.04]  Okay, shall we...
[3388.04 --> 3388.86]  Oh, one more thing.
[3390.10 --> 3394.72]  I had my Bible already, which I prepared yesterday,
[3395.28 --> 3397.90]  and then on my way out the door I forgot it.
[3398.38 --> 3402.16]  So this is a passage I wanted to share.
[3403.36 --> 3409.06]  It's the dedication of the temple in Solomon's day, the temple he had built.
[3409.06 --> 3413.34]  And that evening, that night, God came to Solomon.
[3414.48 --> 3419.10]  And then he said, it's verse 14, 2 Chronicles 7.
[3419.70 --> 3423.52]  So if you want to read the entire chapter, it's probably a good idea today.
[3423.62 --> 3427.36]  But I want to focus on one verse, and it's verse 14.
[3427.36 --> 3436.06]  If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face
[3436.06 --> 3442.40]  and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin
[3442.40 --> 3444.74]  and will heal their land.
[3446.34 --> 3452.16]  And given the times we live in, man, do we need God's help.
[3452.16 --> 3453.62]  Shall we pray?
[3456.56 --> 3458.18]  Father, we art in heaven, Lord, thank you.
[3458.74 --> 3464.52]  Thank you this morning that we can be here, that we can share with the people who made profession of faith,
[3464.62 --> 3465.84]  the people that joined us.
[3466.80 --> 3469.74]  Lord, you are an awesome God.
[3469.84 --> 3471.36]  You have given us life.
[3473.04 --> 3476.46]  Lord, we ask you to help us focus on you always.
[3476.46 --> 3480.82]  Lord, sometimes we have priorities, but they're not your priorities.
[3481.58 --> 3485.14]  Help us to make you a priority.
[3485.36 --> 3489.44]  Lord, we watch TV, we sit on our phone, we do stuff.
[3490.50 --> 3494.36]  And then when there's time, sometimes we just go to the word or pray.
[3495.76 --> 3496.90]  Lord, will you convict us?
[3497.38 --> 3502.00]  Will you convict us to come to you?
[3502.60 --> 3505.46]  Lord, you know us inside out.
[3506.88 --> 3508.54]  Probably better than we know ourselves.
[3509.80 --> 3513.94]  You know our wants, but better than that, Lord, you know our needs.
[3515.26 --> 3516.48]  Lord, we thank you for this church.
[3516.58 --> 3517.86]  We thank you for everybody here.
[3517.94 --> 3522.54]  We thank you for our staff, our pastors who proclaim your word week after week.
[3522.74 --> 3524.12]  We pray we bless each one of them.
[3524.66 --> 3528.80]  We thank you for the music ministry team up here.
[3529.12 --> 3533.14]  We thank you for everyone else that participates in their own ways.
[3533.14 --> 3535.52]  We thank you for children's worship right now.
[3535.64 --> 3539.46]  Lord, we pray will you be with each one of the teachers.
[3539.94 --> 3542.06]  We pray will you be with each one of the students.
[3543.44 --> 3545.44]  Lord, we pray will you be with the students in school.
[3546.70 --> 3547.88]  Some are already done.
[3548.04 --> 3549.64]  Some have another few weeks to go.
[3549.92 --> 3551.42]  We pray will you give them a good summer.
[3552.00 --> 3553.84]  We pray will you refresh the teachers.
[3554.06 --> 3557.16]  Lord, the teachers have such an important role.
[3557.16 --> 3561.56]  Lord, we pray for each one of us here this morning.
[3562.26 --> 3565.06]  We pray will you help us to focus on you.
[3566.26 --> 3571.56]  Help us to be good parents, kids, grandparents.
[3573.24 --> 3576.28]  Help us to be an example to those around us, Lord.
[3577.22 --> 3580.24]  Lord, sometimes we're the meanest to the people we love the most.
[3580.74 --> 3581.84]  Please forgive us for that.
[3581.84 --> 3587.08]  Lord, we ask you to be with us as we continue.
[3587.88 --> 3590.32]  Be with us as we hear your word, Lord.
[3590.98 --> 3594.88]  But not just this day, but on and on and on, Lord.
[3594.98 --> 3597.98]  You gave us an entire Bible for a reason.
[3599.36 --> 3602.26]  So help us to seek your word out.
[3602.68 --> 3603.84]  Help us to pray, Lord.
[3603.94 --> 3608.00]  We pray for our city, this town of Langley, our neighborhood.
[3608.74 --> 3611.02]  We pray for our province, Lord, the leaders there.
[3611.02 --> 3614.82]  Lord, and we pray for our government nationally.
[3615.60 --> 3617.34]  Lord, we just ask you to intervene.
[3618.46 --> 3623.26]  We ask you that, Lord, your will may be done in our world,
[3623.34 --> 3625.32]  that it becomes your world, your kingdom, Lord,
[3625.36 --> 3627.04]  because there is so much that's not right.
[3628.30 --> 3632.26]  We ask you, Lord, each one of us that maybe this week we get on our knees
[3632.26 --> 3636.46]  or we get in a chair and we humbly bow to you and ask you, Lord,
[3636.54 --> 3643.38]  for guidance and help and what can we do, Lord.
[3644.74 --> 3651.26]  The same as you reacted with Solomon, Lord, after he built your house,
[3651.40 --> 3656.16]  that you said, Lord, if you humble yourself and pray and ask,
[3656.16 --> 3658.18]  I will heal your land.
[3658.68 --> 3662.66]  And, Lord, our land needs healing as well as a lot of others.
[3663.48 --> 3666.48]  Lord, as we dig into Romans again this morning, thank you for Romans.
[3667.54 --> 3668.30]  We pray with you.
[3669.78 --> 3672.72]  Be with Pastor Chris as he brings your word, Lord,
[3672.78 --> 3674.32]  that it may be a word from you.
[3675.08 --> 3676.24]  Thank you for your love and care.
[3676.54 --> 3677.54]  Thank you in Jesus' name.
[3677.68 --> 3677.86]  Amen.
[3686.16 --> 3712.16]  This morning we're going to look in Romans at chapter 8,
[3712.16 --> 3716.12]  at least the first part of chapter 8.
[3716.90 --> 3719.96]  Now, before I read those first 17 verses,
[3720.18 --> 3723.46]  and while you are maybe flipping in your Bibles to Romans 8,
[3724.30 --> 3730.48]  I want to just acknowledge that Romans 8 is one of those chapters in the Bible
[3730.48 --> 3734.12]  that is loved by so many people.
[3735.56 --> 3739.48]  Romans 8 is one of my favorite chapters in the Bible
[3739.48 --> 3741.20]  for a whole host of reasons,
[3741.64 --> 3745.04]  not the least of which because it reminds me of my grandma
[3745.04 --> 3747.52]  as it was preached on at her funeral.
[3748.76 --> 3751.14]  There's so much going on in Romans 8
[3751.14 --> 3754.48]  that we're actually going to spend the next four weeks
[3754.48 --> 3757.90]  looking at just Romans 8 together.
[3759.64 --> 3763.34]  Now, from the beginning to the end of Romans 8,
[3763.72 --> 3767.02]  I can say that there are portions of this text
[3767.02 --> 3770.02]  that I have used in biblical counseling,
[3770.02 --> 3771.94]  that I have used in grief counseling.
[3772.50 --> 3776.42]  I've used it to face my own struggles and hardships
[3776.42 --> 3780.12]  and to encourage others in facing trials in their life.
[3780.46 --> 3782.76]  I've used it to speak hope
[3782.76 --> 3786.34]  to someone who's nearing death in the hospital
[3786.34 --> 3788.50]  at the end of their life.
[3789.86 --> 3792.80]  Romans 8 really is one of those chapters
[3792.80 --> 3794.14]  that has it all.
[3794.14 --> 3798.00]  In the book of Romans,
[3798.34 --> 3799.96]  we have been struggling
[3799.96 --> 3803.20]  with the depths of our sin,
[3803.20 --> 3808.88]  with the pervasive and comprehensive impact
[3808.88 --> 3810.28]  of sin in the world,
[3810.86 --> 3813.82]  our inability to be holy,
[3814.54 --> 3815.64]  and we've been struggling
[3815.64 --> 3819.20]  through the scope and the effect of the fall.
[3819.68 --> 3823.58]  Romans 8 marks a shift in Paul's writing.
[3824.46 --> 3827.22]  We shift now to new life
[3827.22 --> 3829.76]  and resurrection adoption.
[3830.78 --> 3834.42]  We shift to what it means to be a son of God,
[3834.50 --> 3835.64]  a brother of Christ,
[3835.80 --> 3838.72]  an heir of God and co-heir with Christ.
[3838.82 --> 3841.50]  And I hope and pray that you too
[3841.50 --> 3844.14]  fall in love with this chapter
[3844.14 --> 3845.50]  in the book of Romans.
[3846.94 --> 3849.42]  I also know that some of your care groups
[3849.42 --> 3852.56]  spent a lot of time on Romans 8
[3852.56 --> 3853.86]  recently as well.
[3854.54 --> 3855.28]  And so for you,
[3855.42 --> 3856.48]  I hope it's still fresh
[3856.48 --> 3859.30]  and I hope that this is also meaningful.
[3859.94 --> 3861.42]  And so get your Bibles out,
[3861.52 --> 3862.72]  get your pens ready,
[3862.78 --> 3864.08]  if that's what you do,
[3864.18 --> 3865.46]  and let's dig into
[3865.46 --> 3867.64]  one of the most loved chapters
[3867.64 --> 3869.06]  in all of the Bible.
[3869.84 --> 3870.42]  Romans 8.
[3870.46 --> 3872.44]  We're going to read the first 17 verses
[3872.44 --> 3873.92]  this morning.
[3873.92 --> 3878.24]  Therefore,
[3878.24 --> 3882.18]  there is now no condemnation
[3882.18 --> 3885.82]  for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[3885.82 --> 3890.36]  Because through Christ Jesus,
[3890.36 --> 3893.06]  the law of the Spirit who gives life
[3893.06 --> 3894.40]  has set you free
[3894.40 --> 3896.96]  from the law of sin and death.
[3897.86 --> 3900.18]  For what the law was powerless to do
[3900.18 --> 3902.00]  because it was weakened by the flesh,
[3902.42 --> 3904.70]  God did by sending his own Son
[3904.70 --> 3906.82]  in the likeness of sinful flesh
[3906.82 --> 3908.68]  to be a sin offering.
[3909.12 --> 3912.04]  And so he condemned sin in the flesh
[3912.04 --> 3914.38]  in order that the righteous requirement
[3914.38 --> 3916.86]  of the law might be fully met in us
[3916.86 --> 3919.46]  who do not live according to the flesh,
[3919.66 --> 3921.76]  but according to the Spirit.
[3923.28 --> 3925.82]  Those who live according to the flesh
[3925.82 --> 3927.28]  have their minds set
[3927.28 --> 3928.84]  on what the flesh desires.
[3929.30 --> 3930.98]  But those who live in accordance
[3930.98 --> 3931.74]  with the Spirit
[3931.74 --> 3933.06]  have their minds set
[3933.06 --> 3934.66]  on what the Spirit desires.
[3935.50 --> 3937.78]  The mind governed by the flesh
[3937.78 --> 3938.66]  is death,
[3938.82 --> 3940.64]  but the mind governed by the Spirit
[3940.64 --> 3942.44]  is life and peace.
[3943.08 --> 3944.78]  The mind governed by the flesh
[3944.78 --> 3946.18]  is hostile to God.
[3946.38 --> 3948.04]  It does not submit to God's law,
[3948.16 --> 3949.42]  nor can it do so.
[3949.80 --> 3951.76]  Those who are in the realm of the flesh
[3951.76 --> 3953.68]  cannot please God.
[3954.48 --> 3955.82]  You, however,
[3956.50 --> 3958.70]  are not in the realm of the flesh,
[3958.74 --> 3961.02]  but are in the realm of the Spirit,
[3961.32 --> 3963.98]  if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you.
[3964.76 --> 3966.06]  And if anyone does not have
[3966.06 --> 3967.10]  the Spirit of Christ,
[3967.20 --> 3968.78]  they do not belong to Christ.
[3968.78 --> 3971.20]  But if Christ is in you,
[3971.40 --> 3973.12]  then even though your body
[3973.12 --> 3975.28]  is subject to death because of sin,
[3975.62 --> 3977.22]  the Spirit gives life
[3977.22 --> 3978.42]  because of righteousness.
[3979.82 --> 3981.24]  And if the Spirit of Him
[3981.24 --> 3983.30]  who raised Jesus from the dead
[3983.30 --> 3984.54]  is living in you,
[3984.90 --> 3987.26]  He who raised Christ from the dead
[3987.26 --> 3988.94]  will also give life
[3988.94 --> 3990.20]  to your mortal bodies
[3990.20 --> 3991.74]  because of His Spirit
[3991.74 --> 3993.50]  who lives in you.
[3993.50 --> 3997.88]  Therefore, brothers and sisters,
[3998.42 --> 3999.94]  we have an obligation,
[4000.94 --> 4002.48]  but it is not to the flesh
[4002.48 --> 4003.80]  to live according to it.
[4004.20 --> 4006.12]  For if you live according to the flesh,
[4006.18 --> 4006.98]  you will die.
[4007.28 --> 4008.76]  But if by the Spirit
[4008.76 --> 4009.86]  you put to death
[4009.86 --> 4011.46]  the misdeeds of the body,
[4011.56 --> 4013.00]  you will live.
[4014.12 --> 4015.36]  For those who are led
[4015.36 --> 4016.50]  by the Spirit of God
[4016.50 --> 4018.64]  are the children of God.
[4018.64 --> 4020.90]  And the Spirit you received
[4020.90 --> 4022.52]  does not make you slaves
[4022.52 --> 4024.38]  so that you live in fear again.
[4024.84 --> 4026.68]  Rather, the Spirit you received
[4026.68 --> 4028.36]  brought about your adoption
[4028.36 --> 4029.76]  to sonship.
[4030.44 --> 4031.94]  By Him we cry,
[4032.18 --> 4033.50]  Abba, Father.
[4034.84 --> 4036.06]  The Spirit Himself testifies
[4036.64 --> 4037.48]  with our spirit
[4037.48 --> 4039.54]  that we are God's children.
[4040.28 --> 4041.46]  Now if we are children,
[4041.64 --> 4042.66]  then we are heirs,
[4043.08 --> 4044.04]  heirs of God
[4044.04 --> 4045.38]  and co-heirs with Christ,
[4045.46 --> 4046.82]  if indeed we share
[4046.82 --> 4047.72]  in His sufferings
[4047.72 --> 4048.98]  in order that we may
[4048.98 --> 4051.98]  also share in His glory.
[4052.66 --> 4053.78]  This is the Word of the Lord.
[4058.28 --> 4059.58]  I was mentioned already
[4059.58 --> 4060.82]  in our service
[4060.82 --> 4063.18]  that last week was Pentecost,
[4063.18 --> 4065.64]  and now we live out of
[4065.64 --> 4068.18]  that post-Pentecost reality
[4068.18 --> 4069.22]  and season.
[4069.48 --> 4070.26]  And so really,
[4070.52 --> 4072.02]  it's fitting for us
[4072.02 --> 4074.48]  that Paul continues here
[4074.48 --> 4075.80]  in Romans 8
[4075.80 --> 4076.76]  with what it means
[4076.76 --> 4078.88]  to be living in
[4078.88 --> 4081.16]  and by the Spirit.
[4081.76 --> 4081.98]  Right?
[4082.06 --> 4082.82]  For those who have
[4082.82 --> 4086.56]  received the Spirit.
[4087.58 --> 4089.26]  And to help us make sense
[4089.26 --> 4091.66]  of our Spirit-filled lives
[4091.66 --> 4093.66]  from Romans 8,
[4094.02 --> 4095.10]  I want to actually,
[4095.40 --> 4096.42]  in our reflection together,
[4096.82 --> 4098.68]  begin at the end
[4098.68 --> 4099.70]  of what we read.
[4099.70 --> 4101.78]  And so I want us
[4101.78 --> 4103.28]  to begin with the identity
[4103.28 --> 4104.70]  that we have been given
[4104.70 --> 4106.14]  by grace through faith
[4106.14 --> 4108.06]  in the work of the Spirit.
[4108.48 --> 4109.72]  And so with your Bibles open,
[4109.94 --> 4111.66]  look at verse 15.
[4113.42 --> 4114.42]  Verse 15,
[4114.64 --> 4115.50]  God says,
[4115.66 --> 4117.34]  this is who you are.
[4118.18 --> 4119.96]  The Spirit you received
[4119.96 --> 4121.44]  does not make you slaves
[4121.44 --> 4123.08]  so that you live in fear again.
[4123.08 --> 4123.62]  Rather,
[4124.22 --> 4125.98]  the Spirit you received
[4125.98 --> 4127.76]  brought about your adoption
[4127.76 --> 4129.28]  to sonship.
[4129.64 --> 4131.24]  And by Him we cry,
[4131.80 --> 4132.22]  Abba,
[4132.72 --> 4133.48]  Father.
[4134.98 --> 4135.44]  Now,
[4135.56 --> 4136.52]  just to clear the air,
[4136.90 --> 4138.12]  the word Abba here
[4138.12 --> 4140.12]  is not the Euro pop group
[4140.12 --> 4141.06]  from the 70s.
[4141.86 --> 4144.10]  It's the Aramaic word
[4144.10 --> 4145.52]  for Father.
[4147.84 --> 4149.22]  But Abba
[4149.22 --> 4152.12]  is a special term.
[4153.22 --> 4154.76]  It's a term of intimacy
[4154.76 --> 4157.24]  and of familiarity.
[4159.40 --> 4160.82]  Rarely does my son,
[4161.00 --> 4162.08]  who's eight year old,
[4162.34 --> 4163.30]  call me father.
[4164.50 --> 4165.34]  He's more likely
[4165.34 --> 4166.22]  to call me daddy
[4166.22 --> 4168.02]  or to call me dad.
[4168.10 --> 4168.20]  Yeah,
[4168.26 --> 4169.26]  my daughter calls me father,
[4169.32 --> 4170.12]  but she's a special breed.
[4170.18 --> 4170.76]  That's why you're not
[4170.76 --> 4171.66]  this illustration, dear.
[4173.62 --> 4174.44]  My son,
[4174.52 --> 4174.98]  who's eight,
[4175.04 --> 4175.62]  is more likely
[4175.62 --> 4176.54]  to call me bruh
[4176.54 --> 4177.56]  than he is
[4177.56 --> 4178.38]  to call me father.
[4181.16 --> 4182.50]  But Paul wants you
[4182.50 --> 4184.62]  to see that kind of intimacy
[4184.62 --> 4187.08]  by using the word Abba.
[4188.20 --> 4188.42]  Right?
[4188.44 --> 4190.40]  It's not just father.
[4190.78 --> 4190.92]  Right?
[4190.92 --> 4191.62]  It's not just
[4191.62 --> 4193.98]  a biological relationship.
[4193.98 --> 4195.18]  It's a relationship
[4195.18 --> 4196.10]  of love
[4196.10 --> 4197.20]  and affection.
[4197.76 --> 4198.36]  And this
[4198.36 --> 4199.48]  is how Christians
[4199.48 --> 4200.58]  are invited
[4200.58 --> 4202.18]  to approach
[4202.18 --> 4203.84]  the all-powerful,
[4203.92 --> 4204.72]  all-knowing
[4204.72 --> 4206.14]  creator God.
[4206.38 --> 4206.50]  Right?
[4206.52 --> 4207.08]  The God
[4207.08 --> 4208.30]  who created the universe
[4208.30 --> 4209.34]  with a word
[4209.34 --> 4210.42]  invites you
[4210.42 --> 4211.60]  to call him
[4211.60 --> 4213.30]  daddy.
[4214.78 --> 4215.46]  The God
[4215.46 --> 4216.16]  of the cosmos
[4216.16 --> 4217.18]  who upholds
[4217.18 --> 4217.94]  everything
[4217.94 --> 4219.54]  by his hand
[4219.54 --> 4220.16]  invites you
[4220.16 --> 4220.84]  to call him
[4220.84 --> 4221.66]  dad.
[4222.96 --> 4223.38]  Now,
[4223.46 --> 4223.90]  I know
[4223.90 --> 4224.80]  that some of you
[4224.80 --> 4225.80]  hear me say that
[4225.80 --> 4226.92]  and you get a little bit
[4226.92 --> 4227.28]  anxious
[4227.28 --> 4228.08]  because you're like,
[4228.16 --> 4228.34]  man,
[4228.40 --> 4229.46]  that's pretty irreverent
[4229.46 --> 4230.84]  and we shouldn't talk
[4230.84 --> 4231.86]  about God like that.
[4232.92 --> 4233.14]  Right?
[4233.22 --> 4233.80]  Sometimes
[4233.80 --> 4234.64]  you might think
[4234.64 --> 4235.80]  that calling God
[4235.80 --> 4236.50]  and Savior
[4236.50 --> 4237.08]  papa
[4237.08 --> 4237.92]  or daddy
[4237.92 --> 4238.74]  is not showing
[4238.74 --> 4239.36]  the respect
[4239.36 --> 4241.08]  or the worship
[4241.08 --> 4241.88]  or the awe
[4241.88 --> 4243.00]  that is due his name
[4243.00 --> 4244.46]  and honestly,
[4244.62 --> 4245.60]  I can empathize
[4245.60 --> 4246.32]  with that.
[4247.18 --> 4247.58]  And yet,
[4248.50 --> 4249.80]  I don't want you
[4249.80 --> 4250.58]  to miss
[4250.58 --> 4252.20]  the intimacy
[4252.20 --> 4253.56]  that you are being
[4253.56 --> 4255.10]  invited to experience
[4255.10 --> 4256.28]  because of
[4256.28 --> 4258.10]  your concern
[4258.10 --> 4259.64]  for irreverence.
[4260.44 --> 4260.82]  Somehow,
[4260.98 --> 4261.50]  we have to hold
[4261.50 --> 4262.68]  those two realities
[4262.68 --> 4263.84]  together.
[4264.60 --> 4264.74]  Right?
[4264.84 --> 4266.28]  There's the intimacy
[4266.28 --> 4267.92]  that we are being
[4267.92 --> 4269.32]  invited to experience
[4269.32 --> 4270.36]  with God here
[4270.36 --> 4272.26]  is so beautiful
[4272.26 --> 4273.06]  and deep
[4273.06 --> 4274.10]  and powerful.
[4275.24 --> 4275.62]  Now,
[4275.76 --> 4277.40]  I also know
[4277.40 --> 4278.72]  that for some
[4278.72 --> 4279.28]  of us,
[4279.42 --> 4280.28]  the relationships
[4280.28 --> 4281.34]  that you have
[4281.34 --> 4282.36]  with your earthly
[4282.36 --> 4282.86]  fathers
[4282.86 --> 4283.98]  are not good
[4283.98 --> 4284.56]  or perhaps
[4284.56 --> 4286.66]  not even existent
[4286.66 --> 4287.66]  and sometimes
[4287.66 --> 4289.20]  that can also
[4289.20 --> 4290.10]  color
[4290.10 --> 4291.34]  your relationship
[4291.34 --> 4292.24]  to God
[4292.24 --> 4293.36]  as father.
[4293.36 --> 4293.42]  father.
[4294.30 --> 4295.02]  And I pray
[4295.02 --> 4295.50]  that even
[4295.50 --> 4296.30]  as we acknowledge
[4296.30 --> 4297.24]  that reality
[4297.24 --> 4299.82]  that the kind
[4299.82 --> 4300.94]  of intimacy
[4300.94 --> 4302.78]  that you mourn
[4302.78 --> 4303.58]  or that you have
[4303.58 --> 4304.42]  lost or that you
[4304.42 --> 4305.28]  have never had
[4305.28 --> 4306.44]  with your earthly
[4306.44 --> 4306.92]  father,
[4307.24 --> 4309.36]  you might experience
[4309.36 --> 4310.68]  with your heavenly
[4310.68 --> 4311.08]  father
[4311.08 --> 4313.22]  because he wants
[4313.22 --> 4314.54]  to love you
[4314.54 --> 4315.68]  in that way
[4315.68 --> 4316.46]  even if you've
[4316.46 --> 4317.82]  never experienced
[4317.82 --> 4318.52]  that love
[4318.52 --> 4319.62]  in your life.
[4320.62 --> 4320.74]  Right?
[4320.74 --> 4321.64]  God wants
[4321.64 --> 4322.46]  a real
[4322.46 --> 4323.36]  relationship
[4323.36 --> 4323.76]  with you.
[4323.84 --> 4324.66]  That's who
[4324.66 --> 4325.28]  you are.
[4325.62 --> 4326.36]  That's why
[4326.36 --> 4327.42]  he adopts
[4327.42 --> 4328.00]  you to
[4328.00 --> 4328.92]  sonship.
[4329.56 --> 4330.00]  Again,
[4330.14 --> 4330.76]  verse 15,
[4330.84 --> 4331.26]  the spirit
[4331.26 --> 4332.04]  you received
[4332.04 --> 4332.80]  brought about
[4332.80 --> 4334.42]  your adoption
[4334.42 --> 4336.34]  to sonship.
[4338.30 --> 4338.58]  Now,
[4339.08 --> 4339.76]  forgive me
[4339.76 --> 4341.32]  for the Greek
[4341.32 --> 4341.84]  language
[4341.84 --> 4342.38]  that we're
[4342.38 --> 4342.88]  about to hear
[4342.88 --> 4343.70]  but literally
[4343.70 --> 4344.42]  in Greek
[4344.42 --> 4345.24]  the sentence
[4345.24 --> 4345.94]  there is
[4345.94 --> 4347.26]  you received
[4347.26 --> 4348.08]  the spirit
[4348.08 --> 4348.76]  who
[4348.76 --> 4349.98]  sonized
[4349.98 --> 4350.40]  you.
[4351.62 --> 4352.44]  Sonized
[4352.44 --> 4352.68]  you.
[4352.76 --> 4352.96]  I think
[4352.96 --> 4353.18]  we have
[4353.18 --> 4353.52]  a slide
[4353.52 --> 4353.86]  for that
[4353.86 --> 4354.08]  one.
[4357.16 --> 4357.56]  Yeah,
[4357.60 --> 4357.96]  the spirit
[4357.96 --> 4358.12]  who
[4358.12 --> 4358.64]  sonized
[4358.64 --> 4358.76]  you.
[4358.80 --> 4358.94]  And I
[4358.94 --> 4359.26]  wanted that
[4359.26 --> 4359.62]  on the screen
[4359.62 --> 4359.98]  because that's
[4359.98 --> 4360.32]  not a real
[4360.32 --> 4361.06]  word in
[4361.06 --> 4361.84]  English anyway.
[4362.50 --> 4362.70]  Right?
[4362.78 --> 4363.82]  To sonize
[4363.82 --> 4364.70]  someone.
[4365.36 --> 4365.46]  Right?
[4365.52 --> 4366.56]  To sonize
[4366.56 --> 4367.22]  is to
[4367.22 --> 4368.46]  have the spirit
[4368.46 --> 4369.18]  make you
[4369.18 --> 4369.98]  a son.
[4371.06 --> 4371.84]  And because
[4371.84 --> 4372.48]  it's not a
[4372.48 --> 4372.90]  word in
[4372.90 --> 4373.38]  English,
[4373.56 --> 4374.30]  we use the
[4374.30 --> 4374.78]  word or the
[4374.78 --> 4375.46]  translators have
[4375.46 --> 4376.18]  substituted the
[4376.18 --> 4376.96]  word adoption.
[4376.96 --> 4377.08]  adoption.
[4378.06 --> 4378.48]  Now,
[4378.54 --> 4379.34]  adoption makes
[4379.34 --> 4380.02]  sense in
[4380.02 --> 4381.06]  this context
[4381.06 --> 4382.66]  because adoption
[4382.66 --> 4386.08]  represents a
[4386.08 --> 4387.76]  legal exchange.
[4387.94 --> 4388.02]  Right?
[4388.10 --> 4388.82]  Once you were
[4388.82 --> 4389.72]  not a son
[4389.72 --> 4390.48]  and now you
[4390.48 --> 4391.24]  have become
[4391.24 --> 4391.52]  one.
[4391.60 --> 4391.98]  Once you
[4391.98 --> 4392.68]  were not
[4392.68 --> 4393.16]  an heir
[4393.16 --> 4393.84]  and now you
[4393.84 --> 4394.56]  have become
[4394.56 --> 4395.32]  an heir.
[4395.66 --> 4396.34]  And the
[4396.34 --> 4396.96]  concept of
[4396.96 --> 4397.80]  adoption is
[4397.80 --> 4398.72]  so important
[4398.72 --> 4399.66]  because it
[4399.66 --> 4400.32]  represents,
[4400.42 --> 4400.70]  like we
[4400.70 --> 4400.92]  said,
[4401.02 --> 4401.86]  a legal
[4401.86 --> 4402.94]  change of
[4402.94 --> 4403.66]  identity.
[4405.66 --> 4406.02]  And throughout
[4406.02 --> 4406.78]  the first part
[4406.78 --> 4407.14]  of the book
[4407.14 --> 4407.76]  of Romans,
[4408.20 --> 4408.80]  Paul has
[4408.80 --> 4409.54]  been building
[4409.54 --> 4410.44]  up this
[4410.44 --> 4411.86]  legal case
[4411.86 --> 4413.04]  against us,
[4413.18 --> 4414.46]  against people,
[4414.66 --> 4415.40]  and he's been
[4415.40 --> 4416.30]  presenting for
[4416.30 --> 4417.74]  us the legal
[4417.74 --> 4419.20]  exchange that
[4419.20 --> 4420.40]  took place on
[4420.40 --> 4421.44]  the cross and
[4421.44 --> 4421.74]  with the
[4421.74 --> 4422.16]  resurrection.
[4423.30 --> 4423.48]  Right?
[4423.48 --> 4423.82]  If you're
[4423.82 --> 4424.56]  reading Romans,
[4424.76 --> 4425.48]  you can't help
[4425.48 --> 4426.38]  but see that
[4426.38 --> 4426.94]  there is this
[4426.94 --> 4428.36]  juridical exchange
[4428.36 --> 4429.42]  that takes
[4429.42 --> 4429.88]  place.
[4430.60 --> 4431.34]  And one very
[4431.34 --> 4432.24]  important aspect
[4432.24 --> 4433.56]  of salvation
[4433.56 --> 4434.78]  is this
[4434.78 --> 4435.68]  juridical
[4435.68 --> 4436.40]  character.
[4437.08 --> 4437.78]  The legal
[4437.78 --> 4438.70]  exchange that
[4438.70 --> 4439.28]  takes place
[4439.28 --> 4440.22]  where my
[4440.22 --> 4441.16]  sin is
[4441.16 --> 4441.94]  imputed,
[4442.22 --> 4442.84]  handed over,
[4442.98 --> 4443.66]  put upon
[4443.66 --> 4444.58]  Christ,
[4444.74 --> 4445.26]  and he
[4445.26 --> 4445.86]  pays the
[4445.86 --> 4446.54]  penalty for
[4446.54 --> 4447.28]  it in dying
[4447.28 --> 4447.66]  the death
[4447.66 --> 4447.90]  that I
[4447.90 --> 4448.32]  deserved.
[4449.22 --> 4449.36]  Right?
[4449.42 --> 4449.98]  And then his
[4449.98 --> 4451.16]  righteousness is
[4451.16 --> 4451.66]  imputed,
[4451.86 --> 4452.62]  is put upon,
[4452.70 --> 4453.48]  is transferred,
[4454.06 --> 4454.78]  his perfect
[4454.78 --> 4455.78]  obedience is
[4455.78 --> 4457.14]  given to me,
[4457.34 --> 4457.94]  and it's
[4457.94 --> 4458.90]  counted in my
[4458.90 --> 4459.34]  favor,
[4459.34 --> 4460.14]  or in the
[4460.14 --> 4461.02]  language of
[4461.02 --> 4461.56]  Romans,
[4461.70 --> 4462.42]  it is credited
[4462.42 --> 4463.54]  to me as
[4463.54 --> 4464.28]  righteousness.
[4465.52 --> 4466.20]  That's what
[4466.20 --> 4467.26]  adoption does.
[4468.46 --> 4468.98]  You were once
[4468.98 --> 4470.02]  not a child of
[4470.02 --> 4470.58]  the Father,
[4470.96 --> 4471.72]  but now you
[4471.72 --> 4472.88]  are a child of
[4472.88 --> 4473.46]  the Father,
[4473.78 --> 4474.96]  whom you call
[4474.96 --> 4475.82]  Abba.
[4477.62 --> 4478.50]  But actually,
[4478.62 --> 4479.02]  it goes even
[4479.02 --> 4479.92]  deeper than that.
[4481.18 --> 4481.30]  Right?
[4481.34 --> 4481.94]  That's why the
[4481.94 --> 4482.70]  Bible says
[4482.70 --> 4483.72]  adoption to
[4483.72 --> 4484.56]  sonship,
[4484.64 --> 4484.78]  right?
[4484.80 --> 4485.26]  That's why we're
[4485.26 --> 4485.92]  trying to figure
[4485.92 --> 4486.66]  out this word
[4486.66 --> 4487.76]  sun-eyes.
[4489.34 --> 4490.38]  A little cultural
[4490.38 --> 4491.36]  context for you.
[4492.44 --> 4493.20]  At this point
[4493.20 --> 4493.90]  in history,
[4494.10 --> 4495.08]  in much of
[4495.08 --> 4495.86]  the Greco-Roman
[4495.86 --> 4496.38]  world,
[4496.72 --> 4497.20]  there's a
[4497.20 --> 4498.18]  practice called
[4498.18 --> 4499.56]  primogeniture.
[4500.26 --> 4500.58]  Now, I know
[4500.58 --> 4501.02]  that's a big
[4501.02 --> 4501.28]  word.
[4501.50 --> 4502.84]  Primo means
[4502.84 --> 4503.48]  first,
[4504.00 --> 4504.90]  and geniture
[4504.90 --> 4505.98]  refers to
[4505.98 --> 4506.86]  generations.
[4507.76 --> 4507.98]  And so,
[4508.06 --> 4508.22]  literally,
[4508.40 --> 4508.98]  it's first
[4508.98 --> 4509.70]  generation,
[4509.92 --> 4510.92]  or first
[4510.92 --> 4511.60]  born
[4511.60 --> 4512.78]  son,
[4513.06 --> 4513.44]  primarily.
[4514.36 --> 4515.04]  Primogeniture,
[4515.20 --> 4515.82]  or the law
[4515.82 --> 4517.02]  of primogeniture,
[4517.38 --> 4518.20]  is the legal
[4518.20 --> 4519.32]  idea that the
[4519.32 --> 4520.58]  firstborn son
[4520.58 --> 4522.32]  inherits everything
[4522.32 --> 4523.30]  from the
[4523.30 --> 4523.60]  father.
[4524.78 --> 4525.30]  So, by way of
[4525.30 --> 4525.48]  analogy,
[4525.58 --> 4525.96]  think about
[4525.96 --> 4526.44]  kings,
[4526.98 --> 4527.18]  right?
[4527.24 --> 4527.96]  The title of
[4527.96 --> 4528.90]  king can only
[4528.90 --> 4530.04]  go to one
[4530.04 --> 4530.70]  son,
[4531.28 --> 4532.10]  usually the
[4532.10 --> 4532.48]  oldest.
[4533.30 --> 4533.90]  And in the
[4533.90 --> 4534.42]  Greco-Roman
[4534.42 --> 4534.90]  world,
[4535.02 --> 4535.72]  more generally,
[4536.04 --> 4537.02]  only males
[4537.02 --> 4537.98]  could inherit
[4537.98 --> 4539.34]  titles and
[4539.34 --> 4539.86]  status.
[4541.14 --> 4542.02]  And so,
[4542.22 --> 4543.70]  you have a
[4543.70 --> 4544.74]  pater familius,
[4544.80 --> 4545.54]  a head of the
[4545.54 --> 4546.26]  family in the
[4546.26 --> 4546.90]  Latin world,
[4547.30 --> 4548.34]  who has no
[4548.34 --> 4549.00]  sons.
[4549.76 --> 4550.38]  He would have
[4550.38 --> 4551.26]  no one to
[4551.26 --> 4551.98]  inherit his
[4551.98 --> 4552.84]  title and his
[4552.84 --> 4553.94]  wealth to.
[4555.38 --> 4555.98]  But,
[4556.04 --> 4556.66]  there is a
[4556.66 --> 4557.52]  legal provision
[4557.52 --> 4558.80]  for him to
[4558.80 --> 4559.92]  adopt one of
[4559.92 --> 4560.88]  his slaves
[4560.88 --> 4562.68]  and make them
[4562.68 --> 4563.70]  as if a
[4563.70 --> 4564.74]  natural-born
[4564.74 --> 4565.60]  son.
[4566.70 --> 4567.38]  But again,
[4567.78 --> 4568.46]  it still had to
[4568.46 --> 4568.92]  be a male.
[4570.32 --> 4570.50]  Now,
[4570.56 --> 4571.26]  I hope that
[4571.26 --> 4571.68]  you're hearing
[4571.68 --> 4572.04]  this,
[4572.10 --> 4572.54]  and I hope that
[4572.54 --> 4572.96]  you're starting
[4572.96 --> 4573.86]  to put the
[4573.86 --> 4574.56]  pieces together
[4574.56 --> 4575.44]  because one
[4575.44 --> 4576.14]  of the amazing
[4576.14 --> 4576.96]  things about
[4576.96 --> 4577.98]  the gospel is
[4577.98 --> 4579.28]  that all of
[4579.28 --> 4579.80]  us who
[4579.80 --> 4580.50]  believe,
[4580.78 --> 4581.44]  all of us
[4581.44 --> 4581.66]  who have
[4581.66 --> 4582.22]  been taken
[4582.22 --> 4583.46]  as slaves
[4583.46 --> 4583.98]  to sin
[4583.98 --> 4584.44]  have been
[4584.44 --> 4585.88]  adopted as
[4585.88 --> 4586.50]  sons.
[4587.10 --> 4587.94]  All of us,
[4588.00 --> 4588.28]  whether you
[4588.28 --> 4589.16]  are male or
[4589.16 --> 4589.64]  female,
[4589.80 --> 4590.38]  who are dead
[4590.38 --> 4590.76]  in our
[4590.76 --> 4591.56]  transgressions and
[4591.56 --> 4591.82]  sins,
[4592.00 --> 4592.34]  have been
[4592.34 --> 4593.16]  raised up
[4593.16 --> 4593.86]  and adopted
[4593.86 --> 4594.58]  as heirs
[4594.58 --> 4595.64]  and co-heirs.
[4596.02 --> 4596.40]  We are
[4596.40 --> 4597.56]  treated just
[4597.56 --> 4598.54]  like Jesus
[4598.54 --> 4599.30]  himself,
[4600.28 --> 4600.48]  right?
[4600.52 --> 4601.28]  Right alongside
[4601.28 --> 4602.00]  with him.
[4602.00 --> 4603.16]  So,
[4603.24 --> 4603.70]  when Paul
[4603.70 --> 4604.40]  says in a
[4604.40 --> 4604.86]  different letter
[4604.86 --> 4605.62]  in Galatians
[4605.62 --> 4605.96]  3,
[4606.12 --> 4606.74]  he says there's
[4606.74 --> 4607.46]  no longer
[4607.46 --> 4608.92]  male nor
[4608.92 --> 4609.78]  female in
[4609.78 --> 4610.52]  Christ Jesus,
[4610.66 --> 4611.38]  this is the
[4611.38 --> 4611.90]  point that he's
[4611.90 --> 4612.28]  making.
[4612.90 --> 4613.54]  That in
[4613.54 --> 4614.42]  Christ Jesus,
[4614.70 --> 4615.30]  the Spirit
[4615.30 --> 4616.24]  granting us
[4616.24 --> 4617.04]  new life,
[4617.42 --> 4618.42]  by the Spirit
[4618.42 --> 4619.52]  we all cry,
[4619.76 --> 4620.62]  male or
[4620.62 --> 4621.18]  female,
[4621.58 --> 4621.94]  Abba.
[4622.54 --> 4623.74]  We are all
[4623.74 --> 4624.76]  adopted as
[4624.76 --> 4625.38]  sons,
[4626.24 --> 4626.38]  right?
[4626.38 --> 4627.22]  That we all
[4627.22 --> 4628.20]  have the legal
[4628.20 --> 4628.56]  right,
[4628.68 --> 4629.38]  the change of
[4629.38 --> 4630.42]  status to
[4630.42 --> 4630.76]  inherit.
[4630.76 --> 4632.22]  Right?
[4632.28 --> 4632.66]  One of the
[4632.66 --> 4633.34]  most beautiful
[4633.34 --> 4634.54]  images of
[4634.54 --> 4635.34]  the gospel is
[4635.34 --> 4636.04]  that men and
[4636.04 --> 4636.48]  women are
[4636.48 --> 4637.46]  both sons
[4637.46 --> 4638.94]  of God.
[4640.26 --> 4641.10]  If you have
[4641.10 --> 4641.70]  the ears to
[4641.70 --> 4642.20]  hear it,
[4643.68 --> 4644.86]  the Apostle
[4644.86 --> 4646.90]  Paul is
[4646.90 --> 4647.68]  being a
[4647.68 --> 4648.24]  groundbreaking
[4648.24 --> 4650.04]  feminist in
[4650.04 --> 4650.60]  this moment.
[4652.60 --> 4653.72]  He's raising
[4653.72 --> 4654.48]  up the
[4654.48 --> 4655.66]  status of
[4655.66 --> 4656.66]  women to
[4656.66 --> 4656.98]  something
[4656.98 --> 4658.16]  unprecedented in
[4658.16 --> 4658.66]  that cultural
[4658.66 --> 4659.06]  moment.
[4659.06 --> 4659.08]  God.
[4659.64 --> 4660.16]  He says
[4660.16 --> 4660.90]  that's what
[4660.90 --> 4662.64]  Christ does.
[4664.18 --> 4664.44]  And so on
[4664.44 --> 4664.98]  the one hand,
[4665.06 --> 4665.70]  the image is
[4665.70 --> 4666.40]  that men and
[4666.40 --> 4666.90]  women are
[4666.90 --> 4667.72]  both sons
[4667.72 --> 4668.62]  of God,
[4668.68 --> 4669.36]  but also in
[4669.36 --> 4669.78]  the Bible,
[4669.78 --> 4670.54]  you have an
[4670.54 --> 4671.26]  image of men
[4671.26 --> 4671.70]  and women
[4671.70 --> 4672.62]  both being
[4672.62 --> 4673.30]  the bride
[4673.30 --> 4674.50]  of Christ.
[4676.70 --> 4677.68]  In Christ
[4677.68 --> 4678.04]  Jesus,
[4678.16 --> 4678.40]  there is
[4678.40 --> 4678.92]  neither male
[4678.92 --> 4680.10]  nor female,
[4680.68 --> 4681.40]  because we
[4681.40 --> 4682.04]  are all
[4682.04 --> 4682.82]  raised up
[4682.82 --> 4684.10]  as those
[4684.10 --> 4684.72]  who may
[4684.72 --> 4685.72]  legitimately,
[4686.42 --> 4686.74]  legally,
[4686.74 --> 4688.36]  inherit the
[4688.36 --> 4689.84]  kingdom of
[4689.84 --> 4690.16]  God.
[4691.94 --> 4692.90]  We are all
[4692.90 --> 4693.26]  sons.
[4693.86 --> 4694.36]  We all
[4694.36 --> 4694.90]  cry,
[4695.16 --> 4695.56]  Abba,
[4696.12 --> 4696.58]  Father.
[4697.02 --> 4697.64]  We are all
[4697.64 --> 4698.12]  God's
[4698.12 --> 4698.74]  children.
[4698.94 --> 4699.42]  And now,
[4699.66 --> 4700.36]  if we are
[4700.36 --> 4700.78]  children,
[4700.96 --> 4701.56]  then we are
[4701.56 --> 4701.94]  heirs,
[4702.14 --> 4702.78]  heirs of
[4702.78 --> 4703.50]  God and
[4703.50 --> 4704.24]  co-heirs
[4704.24 --> 4705.48]  with Christ.
[4707.54 --> 4708.12]  Now,
[4708.18 --> 4708.64]  it's on this
[4708.64 --> 4709.26]  understanding
[4709.26 --> 4709.58]  then,
[4709.94 --> 4710.10]  right?
[4710.16 --> 4710.74]  This was the
[4710.74 --> 4711.26]  end,
[4711.32 --> 4711.72]  so that we
[4711.72 --> 4712.16]  can go back
[4712.16 --> 4712.42]  to the
[4712.42 --> 4712.72]  beginning,
[4713.30 --> 4713.94]  on this
[4713.94 --> 4714.58]  foundation
[4714.58 --> 4715.62]  of our
[4715.62 --> 4716.18]  shared
[4716.18 --> 4716.96]  identity,
[4716.96 --> 4717.84]  now we
[4717.84 --> 4718.20]  can go
[4718.20 --> 4718.76]  back and
[4718.76 --> 4719.16]  start to
[4719.16 --> 4720.16]  see what
[4720.16 --> 4720.64]  it means.
[4721.34 --> 4721.74]  And so,
[4722.44 --> 4723.02]  we are
[4723.02 --> 4723.82]  all sons,
[4724.32 --> 4724.90]  and so
[4724.90 --> 4725.62]  that means
[4725.62 --> 4726.90]  three things.
[4727.60 --> 4727.98]  We are
[4727.98 --> 4728.60]  all sons,
[4728.78 --> 4729.30]  and so
[4729.30 --> 4729.92]  there is
[4729.92 --> 4730.98]  no condemnation
[4730.98 --> 4731.50]  for us,
[4731.52 --> 4731.90]  that's the
[4731.90 --> 4732.18]  first.
[4732.82 --> 4733.28]  The second
[4733.28 --> 4733.56]  that we
[4733.56 --> 4733.86]  will look
[4733.86 --> 4734.28]  at is
[4734.28 --> 4734.82]  our minds
[4734.82 --> 4735.28]  are set
[4735.28 --> 4735.60]  on what
[4735.60 --> 4735.98]  the Spirit
[4735.98 --> 4736.52]  desires,
[4737.36 --> 4737.76]  and then
[4737.76 --> 4738.06]  we will
[4738.06 --> 4738.76]  finish by
[4738.76 --> 4739.46]  looking at
[4739.46 --> 4740.44]  how we
[4740.44 --> 4740.78]  are all
[4740.78 --> 4741.08]  sons,
[4741.08 --> 4741.58]  and so
[4741.58 --> 4742.10]  we put
[4742.10 --> 4742.68]  to death
[4742.68 --> 4744.32]  sin in
[4744.32 --> 4744.82]  our lives.
[4746.12 --> 4746.52]  First,
[4746.64 --> 4746.90]  we are
[4746.90 --> 4747.48]  all sons,
[4747.66 --> 4748.04]  and so
[4748.04 --> 4748.60]  there is
[4748.60 --> 4749.66]  no condemnation.
[4750.10 --> 4750.50]  This is
[4750.50 --> 4751.38]  back in
[4751.38 --> 4752.24]  verse 1.
[4753.06 --> 4753.38]  Therefore,
[4753.68 --> 4754.10]  there is
[4754.10 --> 4754.74]  now no
[4754.74 --> 4755.58]  condemnation
[4755.58 --> 4756.30]  for those
[4756.30 --> 4756.64]  who are
[4756.64 --> 4757.66]  in Christ
[4757.66 --> 4758.58]  Jesus.
[4760.20 --> 4760.80]  Now,
[4760.88 --> 4761.78]  I cannot,
[4762.30 --> 4763.00]  I don't
[4763.00 --> 4763.62]  have the
[4763.62 --> 4764.28]  rhetorical
[4764.28 --> 4764.88]  skill
[4764.88 --> 4766.26]  to
[4766.26 --> 4767.78]  overstate
[4767.78 --> 4768.54]  how
[4768.54 --> 4769.54]  amazing
[4769.54 --> 4770.74]  this
[4770.74 --> 4771.08]  line
[4771.08 --> 4771.46]  is.
[4772.64 --> 4773.48]  I cannot
[4773.48 --> 4774.32]  tell you
[4774.32 --> 4775.26]  how big
[4775.26 --> 4776.12]  and important
[4776.12 --> 4776.60]  this
[4776.60 --> 4777.60]  truth is.
[4778.74 --> 4779.76]  If you
[4779.76 --> 4780.60]  are ever
[4780.60 --> 4781.56]  overwhelmed
[4781.56 --> 4782.70]  by your
[4782.70 --> 4783.04]  struggle
[4783.04 --> 4783.48]  with sin,
[4784.62 --> 4784.94]  if you
[4784.94 --> 4785.40]  are ever
[4785.40 --> 4786.08]  stuck
[4786.08 --> 4786.90]  believing
[4786.90 --> 4788.02]  that you
[4788.02 --> 4788.68]  have done
[4788.68 --> 4789.56]  one too
[4789.56 --> 4790.24]  many bad
[4790.24 --> 4790.86]  things
[4790.86 --> 4791.56]  for God
[4791.56 --> 4792.02]  to forgive
[4792.02 --> 4792.32]  you,
[4792.64 --> 4793.08]  if you're
[4793.08 --> 4793.90]  ever trapped
[4793.90 --> 4794.60]  in the
[4794.60 --> 4795.20]  lie that
[4795.20 --> 4795.92]  your sin
[4795.92 --> 4796.58]  is worse
[4796.58 --> 4797.16]  than everyone
[4797.16 --> 4797.86]  else's,
[4797.86 --> 4798.48]  and that
[4798.48 --> 4799.00]  God would
[4799.00 --> 4799.62]  never love
[4799.62 --> 4799.90]  you,
[4800.66 --> 4801.04]  if you
[4801.04 --> 4801.66]  are afraid
[4801.66 --> 4802.32]  of judgment
[4802.32 --> 4802.88]  and death
[4802.88 --> 4803.40]  because you
[4803.40 --> 4804.40]  just don't
[4804.40 --> 4805.10]  know what
[4805.10 --> 4806.08]  comes afterwards,
[4806.38 --> 4807.12]  this verse
[4807.12 --> 4807.90]  is for you.
[4808.70 --> 4809.08]  There is
[4809.08 --> 4809.74]  now no
[4809.74 --> 4810.62]  condemnation.
[4810.88 --> 4811.20]  That means
[4811.20 --> 4811.72]  there's no
[4811.72 --> 4812.36]  damnation,
[4812.52 --> 4813.02]  there's no
[4813.02 --> 4813.64]  negative
[4813.64 --> 4814.32]  judgment,
[4814.48 --> 4814.72]  there is
[4814.72 --> 4815.44]  now nothing
[4815.44 --> 4816.20]  that will
[4816.20 --> 4817.02]  separate you
[4817.02 --> 4817.58]  from the
[4817.58 --> 4817.90]  love of
[4817.90 --> 4818.20]  God.
[4819.58 --> 4820.00]  Now,
[4820.68 --> 4821.40]  real talk,
[4821.86 --> 4822.04]  right,
[4822.12 --> 4822.40]  there will
[4822.40 --> 4822.82]  still be
[4822.82 --> 4823.48]  consequences
[4823.48 --> 4824.60]  for your
[4824.60 --> 4825.20]  sin in
[4825.20 --> 4825.78]  this life.
[4825.78 --> 4826.44]  There will
[4826.44 --> 4827.02]  still be
[4827.02 --> 4827.88]  an impact
[4827.88 --> 4828.58]  for hurt
[4828.58 --> 4829.08]  caused
[4829.08 --> 4829.54]  and hurt
[4829.54 --> 4829.84]  done.
[4830.16 --> 4830.44]  There will
[4830.44 --> 4830.90]  still be
[4830.90 --> 4831.56]  trauma and
[4831.56 --> 4832.44]  trauma processing
[4832.44 --> 4833.20]  that is
[4833.20 --> 4833.66]  required.
[4833.96 --> 4834.54]  But if
[4834.54 --> 4835.12]  you are
[4835.12 --> 4835.70]  adopted
[4835.70 --> 4836.96]  as sons,
[4837.12 --> 4837.46]  if you
[4837.46 --> 4837.78]  are an
[4837.78 --> 4838.22]  heir of
[4838.22 --> 4838.70]  God and
[4838.70 --> 4839.18]  a co-heir
[4839.18 --> 4839.64]  with Christ,
[4839.76 --> 4840.44]  if you
[4840.44 --> 4841.42]  cry today,
[4841.74 --> 4842.22]  Abba,
[4842.48 --> 4843.00]  Father,
[4843.28 --> 4843.76]  there is
[4843.76 --> 4844.52]  now no
[4844.52 --> 4845.36]  condemnation
[4845.36 --> 4846.18]  for you.
[4846.18 --> 4852.66]  there is
[4852.66 --> 4854.14]  a 20th
[4854.14 --> 4854.56]  century
[4854.56 --> 4855.38]  Welsh
[4855.38 --> 4856.24]  preacher,
[4857.04 --> 4857.36]  his name
[4857.36 --> 4857.76]  is D.
[4857.92 --> 4858.56]  Martin Lloyd
[4858.56 --> 4858.96]  Jones,
[4859.74 --> 4860.34]  and he
[4860.34 --> 4860.96]  said of
[4860.96 --> 4861.20]  this
[4861.20 --> 4861.50]  verse,
[4862.72 --> 4863.70]  most of
[4863.70 --> 4864.32]  our troubles
[4864.32 --> 4865.02]  are due
[4865.02 --> 4865.66]  to our
[4865.66 --> 4866.54]  failure to
[4866.54 --> 4867.40]  realize the
[4867.40 --> 4868.54]  truth of
[4868.54 --> 4868.96]  this
[4868.96 --> 4869.92]  verse.
[4872.54 --> 4872.90]  But for
[4872.90 --> 4873.60]  Lord Jones,
[4873.72 --> 4873.96]  he would
[4873.96 --> 4874.38]  go on to
[4874.38 --> 4874.82]  say that
[4874.82 --> 4875.52]  if we
[4875.52 --> 4876.34]  forget this
[4876.34 --> 4876.86]  truth,
[4877.54 --> 4878.32]  what happens
[4878.32 --> 4878.74]  is that we
[4878.74 --> 4879.58]  feel more
[4879.58 --> 4880.04]  guilt,
[4880.44 --> 4880.82]  we feel
[4880.82 --> 4881.68]  despair and
[4881.68 --> 4882.30]  unworthiness,
[4882.38 --> 4882.78]  and we feel
[4882.78 --> 4883.52]  more pain
[4883.52 --> 4884.02]  than we
[4884.02 --> 4884.36]  should.
[4885.24 --> 4885.90]  And sometimes
[4885.90 --> 4886.50]  that will
[4886.50 --> 4887.30]  show up in
[4887.30 --> 4887.92]  your life
[4887.92 --> 4889.24]  with a sense
[4889.24 --> 4889.60]  that you
[4889.60 --> 4890.00]  need to
[4890.00 --> 4890.94]  over-function
[4890.94 --> 4891.56]  in your
[4891.56 --> 4891.92]  sort of
[4891.92 --> 4892.32]  religious
[4892.32 --> 4892.94]  selves,
[4893.06 --> 4893.18]  right?
[4893.20 --> 4893.34]  That we
[4893.34 --> 4893.54]  have to
[4893.54 --> 4893.94]  prove
[4893.94 --> 4894.36]  ourselves
[4894.36 --> 4894.94]  to God
[4894.94 --> 4895.66]  over and
[4895.66 --> 4896.06]  over and
[4896.06 --> 4896.64]  over again,
[4896.86 --> 4897.04]  and we
[4897.04 --> 4897.22]  have to
[4897.22 --> 4898.06]  bear that
[4898.06 --> 4898.36]  burden.
[4899.42 --> 4899.76]  This was
[4899.76 --> 4900.28]  the burden
[4900.28 --> 4900.80]  that Martin
[4900.80 --> 4901.46]  Luther bore
[4901.46 --> 4902.14]  that spurred
[4902.14 --> 4902.74]  the Reformation.
[4903.92 --> 4904.54]  But not
[4904.54 --> 4905.08]  just in
[4905.08 --> 4905.26]  our
[4905.26 --> 4905.68]  religious
[4905.68 --> 4906.30]  selves,
[4906.72 --> 4906.92]  okay,
[4907.32 --> 4908.04]  but also
[4908.04 --> 4908.40]  in our
[4908.40 --> 4908.92]  emotional
[4908.92 --> 4909.30]  selves,
[4909.38 --> 4909.62]  in our
[4909.62 --> 4910.04]  mental
[4910.04 --> 4910.68]  health
[4910.68 --> 4911.32]  categories.
[4911.62 --> 4912.16]  When we
[4912.16 --> 4912.96]  forget that
[4912.96 --> 4913.28]  there is
[4913.28 --> 4913.80]  now no
[4913.80 --> 4914.48]  condemnation
[4914.48 --> 4915.00]  for those
[4915.00 --> 4915.74]  who are
[4915.74 --> 4916.12]  in Christ
[4916.12 --> 4916.38]  Jesus,
[4916.58 --> 4917.14]  you might
[4917.14 --> 4917.76]  develop a
[4917.76 --> 4918.64]  hypersensitivity
[4918.64 --> 4919.44]  to criticism.
[4921.30 --> 4921.70]  You might
[4921.70 --> 4922.34]  get defensive
[4922.34 --> 4923.20]  at the
[4923.20 --> 4924.06]  first challenge
[4924.06 --> 4924.70]  to who
[4924.70 --> 4925.20]  you are.
[4926.64 --> 4927.46]  When we
[4927.46 --> 4928.06]  forget,
[4928.22 --> 4928.52]  you might
[4928.52 --> 4928.80]  lack
[4928.80 --> 4929.44]  confidence
[4929.44 --> 4930.24]  in your
[4930.24 --> 4931.00]  relationships.
[4932.04 --> 4932.28]  And I
[4932.28 --> 4932.54]  want to be
[4932.54 --> 4933.14]  careful with
[4933.14 --> 4933.38]  what I'm
[4933.38 --> 4933.68]  about to
[4933.68 --> 4933.82]  say,
[4933.94 --> 4934.94]  but be
[4934.94 --> 4935.52]  discerning,
[4935.88 --> 4936.82]  but even
[4936.82 --> 4937.68]  addictive
[4937.68 --> 4938.50]  behaviors,
[4939.10 --> 4939.28]  right,
[4939.30 --> 4939.64]  which can
[4939.64 --> 4940.38]  sometimes be
[4940.38 --> 4941.00]  rooted in a
[4941.00 --> 4941.46]  deep sense
[4941.46 --> 4941.86]  of guilt
[4941.86 --> 4942.70]  or unworthiness
[4942.70 --> 4943.74]  can be the
[4943.74 --> 4944.58]  result of
[4944.58 --> 4945.24]  forgetting,
[4945.92 --> 4946.10]  right,
[4946.10 --> 4946.52]  that there is
[4946.52 --> 4947.08]  now no
[4947.08 --> 4947.84]  condemnation
[4947.84 --> 4948.52]  for those
[4948.52 --> 4948.98]  who are in
[4948.98 --> 4949.54]  Christ Jesus.
[4952.66 --> 4953.68]  But also,
[4953.98 --> 4954.72]  on the other
[4954.72 --> 4955.18]  hand,
[4955.76 --> 4955.94]  right,
[4956.00 --> 4956.80]  if you forget
[4956.80 --> 4957.84]  this truth,
[4958.16 --> 4958.96]  there's also
[4958.96 --> 4959.82]  far less
[4959.82 --> 4960.68]  motivation,
[4961.16 --> 4961.72]  far less
[4961.72 --> 4962.60]  inspiration
[4962.60 --> 4963.30]  towards
[4963.30 --> 4964.34]  holy living,
[4965.22 --> 4965.36]  right?
[4965.38 --> 4965.70]  If we
[4965.70 --> 4966.54]  only ever
[4966.54 --> 4967.64]  obey God
[4967.64 --> 4968.10]  out of
[4968.10 --> 4968.84]  fear or
[4968.84 --> 4969.24]  out of
[4969.24 --> 4969.54]  duty,
[4969.86 --> 4970.40]  we miss
[4970.40 --> 4970.90]  this sense
[4970.90 --> 4971.58]  of gratitude
[4971.58 --> 4972.76]  and love
[4972.76 --> 4973.46]  that can
[4973.46 --> 4973.80]  be a
[4973.80 --> 4974.32]  motivation
[4974.32 --> 4975.10]  when we
[4975.10 --> 4975.68]  recognize
[4975.68 --> 4976.34]  that there's
[4976.34 --> 4977.52]  no condemnation
[4977.52 --> 4978.22]  for those
[4978.22 --> 4978.50]  of us
[4978.50 --> 4978.78]  who are
[4978.78 --> 4979.22]  in Christ
[4979.22 --> 4979.50]  Jesus.
[4979.62 --> 4979.82]  And so,
[4979.88 --> 4980.42]  we thank
[4980.42 --> 4980.74]  Him
[4980.74 --> 4981.44]  with our
[4981.44 --> 4981.86]  lives.
[4982.40 --> 4982.84]  When we
[4982.84 --> 4983.56]  grasp the
[4983.56 --> 4984.48]  full wonder
[4984.48 --> 4985.60]  and majesty
[4985.60 --> 4986.26]  of this
[4986.26 --> 4986.62]  truth,
[4986.92 --> 4987.30]  you will
[4987.30 --> 4987.92]  long to
[4987.92 --> 4988.50]  walk in
[4988.50 --> 4988.92]  holiness
[4988.92 --> 4989.66]  with God.
[4989.90 --> 4990.26]  You will
[4990.26 --> 4990.74]  long to
[4990.74 --> 4991.36]  live as
[4991.36 --> 4992.28]  God wants
[4992.28 --> 4992.62]  you to
[4992.62 --> 4993.12]  live because
[4993.12 --> 4993.62]  of what
[4993.62 --> 4994.48]  He has
[4994.48 --> 4995.74]  given us,
[4995.92 --> 4996.40]  adoption
[4996.40 --> 4997.80]  as sons.
[4999.70 --> 4999.94]  Now,
[5000.00 --> 5000.36]  we will
[5000.36 --> 5001.76]  fall short
[5001.76 --> 5002.50]  and we
[5002.50 --> 5003.08]  will struggle,
[5003.48 --> 5004.02]  but we
[5004.02 --> 5004.98]  will move
[5004.98 --> 5005.82]  forward.
[5007.24 --> 5007.80]  This is the
[5007.80 --> 5008.18]  point of
[5008.18 --> 5009.36]  verse 5,
[5010.24 --> 5011.06]  where we
[5011.06 --> 5011.28]  read,
[5011.28 --> 5011.76]  those who
[5011.76 --> 5012.42]  live according
[5012.42 --> 5012.78]  to the
[5012.78 --> 5013.40]  flesh have
[5013.40 --> 5014.06]  their mindset
[5014.06 --> 5014.64]  on what
[5014.64 --> 5015.08]  the flesh
[5015.08 --> 5015.62]  desires,
[5016.04 --> 5016.54]  but those
[5016.54 --> 5017.10]  who live in
[5017.10 --> 5017.64]  accordance with
[5017.64 --> 5018.24]  the Spirit
[5018.24 --> 5018.88]  have their
[5018.88 --> 5019.74]  mindset on
[5019.74 --> 5020.12]  what the
[5020.12 --> 5020.52]  Spirit
[5020.52 --> 5021.60]  desires.
[5022.64 --> 5023.16]  To be
[5023.16 --> 5023.84]  a son
[5023.84 --> 5024.48]  is to
[5024.48 --> 5025.42]  live as
[5025.42 --> 5026.10]  a son,
[5027.18 --> 5028.12]  no longer
[5028.12 --> 5028.84]  as a
[5028.84 --> 5029.16]  slave,
[5029.92 --> 5030.94]  which brings
[5030.94 --> 5031.58]  us to our
[5031.58 --> 5032.22]  second point
[5032.22 --> 5032.60]  here, that
[5032.60 --> 5033.22]  we are all
[5033.22 --> 5034.22]  sons and so
[5034.22 --> 5035.08]  our minds
[5035.08 --> 5036.04]  are set on
[5036.04 --> 5036.56]  what the
[5036.56 --> 5036.92]  Spirit
[5036.92 --> 5038.30]  desires.
[5039.72 --> 5039.90]  Now,
[5039.92 --> 5040.22]  what does it
[5040.22 --> 5040.58]  mean to
[5040.58 --> 5040.88]  have your
[5040.88 --> 5041.80]  mind set
[5041.80 --> 5042.90]  on something
[5042.90 --> 5043.32]  or to
[5043.32 --> 5043.60]  have your
[5043.60 --> 5044.70]  mind governed
[5044.70 --> 5045.98]  by something?
[5045.98 --> 5047.64]  To have
[5047.64 --> 5048.00]  your mind
[5048.00 --> 5048.56]  set on
[5048.56 --> 5049.16]  something or
[5049.16 --> 5049.96]  governed by
[5049.96 --> 5050.60]  something is
[5050.60 --> 5051.28]  to think
[5051.28 --> 5052.68]  intently and
[5052.68 --> 5054.38]  intensely about
[5054.38 --> 5055.04]  it, is to be
[5055.04 --> 5056.66]  totally captivated
[5056.66 --> 5057.50]  by it.
[5058.24 --> 5059.22]  Paul, here in
[5059.22 --> 5059.92]  our text, is
[5059.92 --> 5060.72]  making a very
[5060.72 --> 5061.40]  clear and
[5061.40 --> 5062.14]  straight line
[5062.14 --> 5062.92]  between right
[5062.92 --> 5064.00]  thinking and
[5064.00 --> 5064.80]  right living.
[5065.00 --> 5065.34]  There's a
[5065.34 --> 5065.86]  connected
[5065.86 --> 5067.02]  relationship between
[5067.02 --> 5068.08]  our orthodoxy,
[5068.14 --> 5068.52]  that is, our
[5068.52 --> 5069.36]  right doctrines,
[5069.50 --> 5069.98]  and our
[5069.98 --> 5070.74]  orthopraxy,
[5070.88 --> 5071.24]  that is, our
[5071.24 --> 5072.10]  right doing.
[5072.72 --> 5073.74]  Our cognition
[5073.74 --> 5074.44]  and our
[5074.44 --> 5075.76]  behavior are
[5075.76 --> 5076.16]  related.
[5077.54 --> 5078.12]  Paul is
[5078.12 --> 5078.62]  saying that
[5078.62 --> 5079.30]  to be a
[5079.30 --> 5080.06]  son, to be
[5080.06 --> 5080.76]  an heir and
[5080.76 --> 5081.46]  co-heir with
[5081.46 --> 5082.52]  Christ, means
[5082.52 --> 5083.28]  to have your
[5083.28 --> 5085.02]  mind captivated,
[5085.36 --> 5086.18]  full of the
[5086.18 --> 5087.10]  things of God,
[5087.38 --> 5087.96]  the things of
[5087.96 --> 5088.38]  the Spirit.
[5089.72 --> 5090.14]  Now, again,
[5090.82 --> 5092.28]  sometimes you
[5092.28 --> 5093.46]  will hear people
[5093.46 --> 5094.30]  say of
[5094.30 --> 5095.82]  Christians that
[5095.82 --> 5096.62]  they are so
[5096.62 --> 5097.58]  heavenly minded
[5097.58 --> 5098.22]  that they're of
[5098.22 --> 5098.84]  no earthly
[5098.84 --> 5099.20]  good.
[5100.44 --> 5101.32]  That's not what
[5101.32 --> 5101.72]  we're talking
[5101.72 --> 5102.26]  about here.
[5103.74 --> 5104.34]  In fact,
[5104.68 --> 5105.28]  what I believe
[5105.28 --> 5105.98]  Paul is
[5105.98 --> 5106.72]  saying is that
[5106.72 --> 5107.74]  when you focus
[5107.74 --> 5108.48]  on the
[5108.48 --> 5109.10]  goodness of
[5109.10 --> 5109.60]  God, when
[5109.60 --> 5110.44]  you focus on
[5110.44 --> 5112.06]  glorifying God
[5112.06 --> 5112.54]  in all that
[5112.54 --> 5113.00]  you do and
[5113.00 --> 5113.40]  in all that
[5113.40 --> 5113.80]  you say,
[5114.12 --> 5114.84]  your impact
[5114.84 --> 5115.74]  in the world
[5115.74 --> 5116.64]  will be greater
[5116.64 --> 5117.22]  than it has
[5117.22 --> 5117.86]  any right to
[5117.86 --> 5119.04]  be because you
[5119.04 --> 5119.56]  will be a
[5119.56 --> 5120.18]  vehicle for
[5120.18 --> 5120.92]  God's work
[5120.92 --> 5121.78]  in the world
[5121.78 --> 5122.54]  through you.
[5124.82 --> 5125.50]  And then,
[5125.80 --> 5126.54]  I think that
[5126.54 --> 5127.76]  this is about
[5127.76 --> 5128.70]  the attitude
[5128.70 --> 5130.80]  of your mind.
[5130.80 --> 5132.28]  it's about
[5132.28 --> 5132.64]  what you
[5132.64 --> 5133.56]  truly and
[5133.56 --> 5134.14]  genuinely
[5134.14 --> 5135.18]  love.
[5135.28 --> 5135.76]  This is about
[5135.76 --> 5136.30]  what you are
[5136.30 --> 5138.30]  captivated by.
[5140.10 --> 5141.28]  William Temple
[5141.28 --> 5143.18]  was the
[5143.18 --> 5144.18]  Archbishop of
[5144.18 --> 5145.18]  Canterbury in
[5145.18 --> 5145.72]  the Church of
[5145.72 --> 5146.38]  England from
[5146.38 --> 5147.90]  1942 to
[5147.90 --> 5148.90]  1944.
[5150.02 --> 5150.62]  So, that's
[5150.62 --> 5152.00]  right in the
[5152.00 --> 5152.60]  heart of
[5152.60 --> 5153.18]  World War II.
[5154.04 --> 5154.76]  And he said,
[5154.76 --> 5156.38]  your religion
[5156.38 --> 5157.24]  is what you
[5157.24 --> 5158.22]  do in your
[5158.22 --> 5158.82]  solitude.
[5160.70 --> 5161.34]  What do
[5161.34 --> 5161.72]  he mean by
[5161.72 --> 5161.98]  that?
[5163.16 --> 5163.36]  Right?
[5163.98 --> 5165.24]  Whenever you
[5165.24 --> 5166.36]  are alone
[5166.36 --> 5167.32]  or wherever
[5167.32 --> 5168.34]  your mind
[5168.34 --> 5168.98]  goes, when
[5168.98 --> 5169.40]  there's nothing
[5169.40 --> 5169.80]  else to
[5169.80 --> 5170.60]  distract it,
[5170.94 --> 5171.52]  wherever your
[5171.52 --> 5172.26]  mind goes,
[5172.34 --> 5172.64]  when there's
[5172.64 --> 5173.10]  nothing else
[5173.10 --> 5173.64]  to keep you
[5173.64 --> 5175.22]  busy, that's
[5175.22 --> 5175.64]  what you
[5175.64 --> 5176.18]  really live
[5176.18 --> 5176.46]  for.
[5178.10 --> 5178.50]  Whatever
[5178.50 --> 5179.58]  occupies your
[5179.58 --> 5180.76]  mind shapes
[5180.76 --> 5181.46]  your life.
[5182.88 --> 5183.30]  That's why
[5183.30 --> 5183.86]  someone like
[5183.86 --> 5184.72]  Jonathan Peugeot
[5184.72 --> 5185.82]  calls worship
[5185.82 --> 5186.60]  attention.
[5187.64 --> 5188.18]  What are you
[5188.18 --> 5188.60]  giving your
[5188.60 --> 5189.50]  attention to?
[5191.18 --> 5192.20]  The mind
[5192.20 --> 5192.86]  governed by
[5192.86 --> 5193.52]  the Spirit
[5193.52 --> 5194.88]  is life
[5194.88 --> 5196.86]  and peace.
[5199.24 --> 5200.02]  Be
[5200.02 --> 5200.94]  captivated
[5200.94 --> 5202.60]  by the
[5202.60 --> 5202.94]  Spirit.
[5203.62 --> 5203.92]  Give your
[5203.92 --> 5205.18]  attention to
[5205.18 --> 5205.64]  the things
[5205.64 --> 5206.38]  of God
[5206.38 --> 5207.46]  and see
[5207.46 --> 5208.54]  what He
[5208.54 --> 5209.24]  might do
[5209.24 --> 5210.58]  in and
[5210.58 --> 5211.10]  through you.
[5212.08 --> 5212.42]  And then
[5212.42 --> 5212.76]  lastly,
[5212.76 --> 5213.50]  our final
[5213.50 --> 5214.24]  point.
[5214.72 --> 5216.44]  we are
[5216.44 --> 5217.34]  all sons
[5217.34 --> 5218.28]  and so
[5218.28 --> 5218.86]  we put
[5218.86 --> 5219.62]  sin to
[5219.62 --> 5220.00]  death
[5220.00 --> 5221.08]  in our
[5221.08 --> 5221.44]  lives.
[5223.02 --> 5223.70]  This is
[5223.70 --> 5224.04]  verse
[5224.04 --> 5225.18]  12
[5225.18 --> 5226.82]  and 13.
[5228.18 --> 5228.48]  Therefore,
[5228.86 --> 5229.40]  brothers and
[5229.40 --> 5229.74]  sisters,
[5229.92 --> 5230.46]  we have an
[5230.46 --> 5231.04]  obligation,
[5231.30 --> 5231.64]  but it is
[5231.64 --> 5232.16]  not to the
[5232.16 --> 5232.66]  flesh to
[5232.66 --> 5233.10]  live according
[5233.10 --> 5233.48]  to it.
[5233.76 --> 5234.38]  For if you
[5234.38 --> 5234.96]  live according
[5234.96 --> 5235.36]  to the
[5235.36 --> 5235.68]  flesh,
[5235.76 --> 5236.16]  you will
[5236.16 --> 5236.48]  die.
[5236.74 --> 5237.34]  But if
[5237.34 --> 5237.84]  by the
[5237.84 --> 5238.46]  Spirit you
[5238.46 --> 5238.94]  put to
[5238.94 --> 5239.46]  death the
[5239.46 --> 5240.04]  misdeeds
[5240.04 --> 5240.42]  of the
[5240.42 --> 5240.76]  body,
[5240.76 --> 5242.02]  you will
[5242.02 --> 5242.84]  live.
[5244.16 --> 5244.50]  Now,
[5244.52 --> 5245.12]  this idea
[5245.12 --> 5245.78]  of putting
[5245.78 --> 5246.38]  to death
[5246.38 --> 5247.22]  the misdeeds
[5247.22 --> 5247.66]  of the
[5247.66 --> 5248.52]  body is
[5248.52 --> 5248.80]  what
[5248.80 --> 5250.16]  theologians
[5250.16 --> 5250.72]  call,
[5250.84 --> 5251.30]  or at least
[5251.30 --> 5251.84]  used to
[5251.84 --> 5252.16]  call,
[5252.54 --> 5253.38]  mortification.
[5254.48 --> 5254.68]  Now,
[5254.68 --> 5255.00]  some of you
[5255.00 --> 5255.20]  have been
[5255.20 --> 5255.60]  around the
[5255.60 --> 5256.20]  church long
[5256.20 --> 5256.82]  enough to
[5256.82 --> 5257.68]  have grown
[5257.68 --> 5258.36]  up reading
[5258.36 --> 5258.86]  the King
[5258.86 --> 5259.54]  James Version
[5259.54 --> 5259.98]  of the
[5259.98 --> 5260.28]  Bible.
[5260.84 --> 5261.46]  The King
[5261.46 --> 5262.16]  James Version
[5262.16 --> 5262.46]  of the
[5262.46 --> 5262.70]  Bible
[5262.70 --> 5263.42]  translates
[5263.42 --> 5264.36]  verse 13
[5264.36 --> 5265.42]  like this.
[5265.42 --> 5265.92]  It says,
[5266.14 --> 5266.60]  If ye
[5266.60 --> 5267.26]  through the
[5267.26 --> 5267.94]  Spirit do
[5267.94 --> 5268.84]  mortify the
[5268.84 --> 5269.36]  deeds of
[5269.36 --> 5269.80]  the body,
[5270.16 --> 5270.86]  ye shall
[5270.86 --> 5271.44]  live.
[5272.22 --> 5272.84]  That's that
[5272.84 --> 5273.16]  word,
[5273.60 --> 5274.18]  mortify.
[5275.42 --> 5275.60]  All right,
[5275.66 --> 5276.08]  verse 12
[5276.08 --> 5276.60]  and 13
[5276.60 --> 5277.26]  tell us
[5277.26 --> 5277.46]  what
[5277.46 --> 5278.42]  mortification
[5278.42 --> 5279.48]  is,
[5279.66 --> 5279.96]  what it
[5279.96 --> 5280.48]  means to
[5280.48 --> 5281.10]  put to
[5281.10 --> 5281.62]  death
[5281.62 --> 5282.90]  these
[5282.90 --> 5283.70]  misdeeds
[5283.70 --> 5284.50]  of the
[5284.50 --> 5284.80]  body.
[5285.40 --> 5285.62]  And so
[5285.62 --> 5286.04]  first,
[5286.20 --> 5286.62]  it means
[5286.62 --> 5287.98]  total and
[5287.98 --> 5288.66]  full-hearted,
[5289.04 --> 5289.36]  it means
[5289.36 --> 5290.74]  complete and
[5290.74 --> 5291.56]  violent and
[5291.56 --> 5292.26]  forceful
[5292.26 --> 5293.52]  rejection of
[5293.52 --> 5294.60]  everything you
[5294.60 --> 5295.22]  know to
[5295.22 --> 5295.82]  be wrong
[5295.82 --> 5296.44]  in your
[5296.44 --> 5296.84]  life.
[5298.06 --> 5298.60]  And make
[5298.60 --> 5298.94]  sure you
[5298.94 --> 5299.28]  hear that
[5299.28 --> 5299.72]  last bit,
[5299.78 --> 5299.94]  right?
[5300.14 --> 5300.40]  Because
[5300.40 --> 5301.96]  mortification
[5301.96 --> 5303.08]  is something
[5303.08 --> 5304.16]  you do
[5304.16 --> 5304.96]  in your
[5304.96 --> 5305.42]  life,
[5306.10 --> 5307.30]  not in
[5307.30 --> 5307.58]  the lives
[5307.58 --> 5307.86]  of other
[5307.86 --> 5308.12]  people.
[5309.54 --> 5310.28]  It's not
[5310.28 --> 5310.74]  your job
[5310.74 --> 5311.50]  to mortify
[5311.50 --> 5312.64]  other people's
[5312.64 --> 5313.40]  misdeeds.
[5314.48 --> 5315.20]  That's for
[5315.20 --> 5315.42]  them.
[5316.34 --> 5316.98]  That's not
[5316.98 --> 5317.14]  your
[5317.14 --> 5317.76]  responsibility.
[5319.96 --> 5320.72]  But it
[5320.72 --> 5321.38]  does mean,
[5321.52 --> 5322.18]  as Tim
[5322.18 --> 5323.08]  Keller has
[5323.08 --> 5323.34]  said,
[5323.66 --> 5324.38]  that a
[5324.38 --> 5324.72]  Christian
[5325.22 --> 5325.54]  doesn't play
[5325.54 --> 5326.30]  games with
[5326.30 --> 5326.56]  sin.
[5327.10 --> 5327.46]  You don't
[5327.46 --> 5327.94]  aim to
[5327.94 --> 5328.36]  wean
[5328.36 --> 5328.84]  yourself
[5328.84 --> 5329.32]  off of
[5329.32 --> 5329.60]  it or
[5329.60 --> 5329.94]  say,
[5330.44 --> 5330.64]  I can
[5330.64 --> 5330.98]  keep it
[5330.98 --> 5331.16]  under
[5331.16 --> 5331.58]  control.
[5331.78 --> 5332.16]  You get
[5332.16 --> 5332.56]  as far
[5332.56 --> 5333.00]  away from
[5333.00 --> 5333.22]  it as
[5333.22 --> 5333.68]  possible.
[5335.10 --> 5335.58]  This isn't
[5335.58 --> 5336.16]  a game,
[5336.30 --> 5336.82]  this is
[5336.82 --> 5337.20]  war.
[5338.52 --> 5339.16]  Too many
[5339.16 --> 5339.58]  of us
[5339.58 --> 5340.30]  overestimate
[5340.30 --> 5340.94]  our power
[5340.94 --> 5341.52]  over sin.
[5342.60 --> 5343.20]  You have
[5343.20 --> 5343.44]  none.
[5344.38 --> 5344.76]  That all
[5344.76 --> 5345.10]  comes from
[5345.10 --> 5345.34]  God.
[5347.10 --> 5347.74]  And here's
[5347.74 --> 5348.04]  the real
[5348.04 --> 5349.54]  power of
[5349.54 --> 5350.20]  mortification.
[5351.12 --> 5351.84]  The process
[5351.84 --> 5352.76]  of mortification
[5352.76 --> 5353.70]  goes deeper
[5353.70 --> 5354.34]  than just
[5354.34 --> 5355.18]  resisting
[5355.18 --> 5355.88]  sinful
[5355.88 --> 5356.62]  behavior.
[5357.28 --> 5357.96]  Mortification
[5357.96 --> 5359.14]  remembers
[5359.14 --> 5360.06]  the gospel.
[5360.68 --> 5361.30]  Mortification
[5361.30 --> 5362.02]  remembers,
[5362.32 --> 5362.78]  remember the
[5362.78 --> 5363.24]  first verse,
[5363.50 --> 5363.84]  that there is
[5363.84 --> 5364.38]  now no
[5364.38 --> 5365.08]  condemnation
[5365.08 --> 5365.74]  for those
[5365.74 --> 5366.04]  who are
[5366.04 --> 5366.44]  in Christ
[5366.44 --> 5366.78]  Jesus.
[5367.10 --> 5367.70]  Mortification
[5367.70 --> 5368.48]  applies the
[5368.48 --> 5369.16]  gospel truth
[5369.16 --> 5369.80]  that by grace
[5369.80 --> 5370.26]  through faith
[5370.26 --> 5371.20]  you have died
[5371.20 --> 5371.66]  with him
[5371.66 --> 5372.10]  and you have
[5372.10 --> 5372.92]  been raised
[5372.92 --> 5373.32]  with him
[5373.32 --> 5374.08]  in newness
[5374.08 --> 5375.10]  of life.
[5376.18 --> 5376.82]  Putting to
[5376.82 --> 5377.30]  death the
[5377.30 --> 5378.04]  misdeeds of
[5378.04 --> 5378.74]  the flesh
[5378.74 --> 5379.76]  only works
[5379.76 --> 5380.24]  if,
[5380.54 --> 5381.08]  you look
[5381.08 --> 5381.44]  at verse
[5381.44 --> 5381.94]  11,
[5382.98 --> 5383.94]  if the
[5383.94 --> 5384.50]  spirit of
[5384.50 --> 5384.88]  him who
[5384.88 --> 5385.58]  raised Jesus
[5385.58 --> 5386.00]  from the
[5386.00 --> 5386.48]  dead is
[5386.48 --> 5387.40]  living in
[5387.40 --> 5387.84]  you,
[5388.08 --> 5388.70]  he who
[5388.70 --> 5389.52]  raised Christ
[5389.52 --> 5389.86]  from the
[5389.86 --> 5390.28]  dead will
[5390.28 --> 5390.92]  also give
[5390.92 --> 5391.44]  life to
[5391.44 --> 5391.96]  your mortal
[5391.96 --> 5392.94]  bodies because
[5392.94 --> 5393.36]  of his
[5393.36 --> 5394.06]  spirit who
[5394.06 --> 5395.08]  lives in
[5395.08 --> 5395.68]  you.
[5397.00 --> 5397.76]  The way
[5397.76 --> 5398.60]  of Christian
[5398.60 --> 5399.76]  living is
[5399.76 --> 5400.56]  the way of
[5400.56 --> 5401.22]  putting to
[5401.22 --> 5402.12]  death the
[5402.12 --> 5402.92]  old and
[5402.92 --> 5404.04]  living out
[5404.04 --> 5404.86]  of the
[5404.86 --> 5405.10]  new.
[5405.10 --> 5408.42]  you can
[5408.42 --> 5409.40]  break sin's
[5409.40 --> 5410.68]  power over
[5410.68 --> 5411.44]  you because
[5411.44 --> 5413.42]  sin itself
[5413.42 --> 5414.24]  has been
[5414.24 --> 5414.64]  broken.
[5416.04 --> 5416.64]  He who
[5416.64 --> 5417.30]  knew no
[5417.30 --> 5418.14]  sin became
[5418.14 --> 5419.56]  sin for
[5419.56 --> 5420.62]  us that
[5420.62 --> 5421.58]  we might
[5421.58 --> 5422.58]  become the
[5422.58 --> 5423.20]  righteousness
[5423.20 --> 5425.04]  of God.
[5427.34 --> 5428.62]  Jesus has
[5428.62 --> 5429.52]  made you a
[5429.52 --> 5430.70]  son like
[5430.70 --> 5431.42]  him.
[5432.58 --> 5433.24]  God,
[5433.34 --> 5433.46]  your
[5433.46 --> 5434.00]  father,
[5434.56 --> 5435.04]  Abba,
[5435.10 --> 5435.98]  has made
[5435.98 --> 5436.48]  you an
[5436.48 --> 5437.72]  heir with
[5437.72 --> 5438.40]  him.
[5439.24 --> 5439.82]  He has
[5439.82 --> 5440.34]  crippled
[5440.34 --> 5440.94]  sin's
[5440.94 --> 5442.00]  power in
[5442.00 --> 5442.60]  your life
[5442.60 --> 5443.28]  and so
[5443.28 --> 5444.02]  put it to
[5444.02 --> 5444.42]  death.
[5444.84 --> 5445.58]  Mortify it.
[5445.70 --> 5446.54]  Wage war
[5446.54 --> 5447.90]  against that
[5447.90 --> 5448.50]  sin.
[5449.78 --> 5450.32]  And yes,
[5450.44 --> 5450.94]  in this
[5450.94 --> 5451.36]  life,
[5451.66 --> 5452.28]  in this
[5452.28 --> 5452.86]  world,
[5453.08 --> 5453.54]  whether it's
[5453.54 --> 5454.10]  because we
[5454.10 --> 5454.52]  live in an
[5454.52 --> 5454.94]  increasingly
[5454.94 --> 5455.70]  post-Christian
[5455.70 --> 5456.70]  world or
[5456.70 --> 5457.12]  it's just
[5457.12 --> 5457.48]  because,
[5457.66 --> 5458.08]  as Jesus
[5458.08 --> 5458.50]  said,
[5458.56 --> 5458.94]  in this
[5458.94 --> 5459.64]  world you
[5459.64 --> 5459.98]  will have
[5459.98 --> 5460.88]  trouble or
[5460.88 --> 5461.44]  it's because
[5461.44 --> 5461.98]  we are
[5461.98 --> 5462.82]  human in
[5462.82 --> 5463.28]  this world
[5463.28 --> 5463.60]  and there
[5463.60 --> 5463.98]  are things
[5463.98 --> 5464.62]  like illnesses
[5464.62 --> 5465.34]  and disease
[5465.34 --> 5466.08]  and cancers
[5466.08 --> 5466.96]  and struggles
[5466.96 --> 5467.70]  and trials
[5467.70 --> 5468.60]  and tribulations
[5468.60 --> 5469.28]  that we've
[5469.28 --> 5469.74]  faced.
[5469.82 --> 5470.24]  The truth
[5470.24 --> 5470.80]  is that
[5470.80 --> 5471.74]  all of us
[5471.74 --> 5472.20]  who long
[5472.20 --> 5472.52]  to be
[5472.52 --> 5472.98]  faithful to
[5472.98 --> 5473.22]  Jesus
[5473.22 --> 5474.48]  will suffer.
[5475.32 --> 5476.06]  In 2 Timothy
[5476.06 --> 5476.60]  3,
[5476.72 --> 5477.24]  Paul writes,
[5477.42 --> 5478.06]  everyone who
[5478.06 --> 5478.68]  wants to live
[5478.68 --> 5479.42]  a godly life
[5479.42 --> 5479.86]  in Christ
[5479.86 --> 5480.82]  Jesus will
[5480.82 --> 5481.68]  be persecuted.
[5482.48 --> 5483.14]  But the
[5483.14 --> 5484.04]  suffering is
[5484.04 --> 5484.82]  not the
[5484.82 --> 5485.38]  end of
[5485.38 --> 5486.06]  the story.
[5487.10 --> 5487.72]  The suffering
[5487.72 --> 5488.30]  is not the
[5488.30 --> 5488.70]  end of the
[5488.70 --> 5489.04]  story.
[5489.04 --> 5489.46]  And so
[5489.46 --> 5490.88]  wherever you
[5490.88 --> 5491.54]  are in
[5491.54 --> 5492.08]  this journey
[5492.08 --> 5492.50]  of life
[5492.50 --> 5492.94]  and faith
[5492.94 --> 5493.68]  right now,
[5494.32 --> 5494.96]  remember
[5494.96 --> 5495.94]  this.
[5496.04 --> 5496.28]  And we're
[5496.28 --> 5496.46]  going to
