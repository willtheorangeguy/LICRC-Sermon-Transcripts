• Comparison between Jonah's book and other minor prophets in terms of format and structure

• Reference to stories of Elijah and Elisha for comparison with Jonah's story
• The book of Jonah subverts traditional prophecy by portraying the prophet as flawed
• The story highlights the conversion of the people on the boat, who are not Israelites, and their reverence for God
• In contrast to Jonah's negative character, the king of Nineveh repents and seeks mercy from God
• The book is a "gentle parody" of traditional prophecy, challenging readers' expectations and understanding of God's relationship with the world
• The story serves to teach post-exilic Judah about God's relationship with both the world at large and his chosen people specifically.
• The book of Jonah is about God's election and how it's bigger than human expectations.
• The book challenges presumptions and preconceived ideas about God's justice, showing that it cuts both ways and excludes those thought to be included.
• The book also highlights the importance of God's mercy, which is necessary for his election and justice.
• God's justice and mercy are not contradictory, but rather two aspects of His character that work together.
• The idea of choosing between justice and mercy is a false dichotomy, as they are intertwined in God's nature and should be in human behaviour.
• God's deity (simplicity) means He cannot contain contradictions, so justice and mercy must coexist.
• Practically, this means recognizing that grace and truth are not mutually exclusive, but rather complementary aspects of God's character.
• Jesus is the embodiment of God's work in the world
• Grace and truth are perfectly revealed in union with Jesus
• Justice and mercy are hand-in-glove attributes of God's work
• Overemphasizing one over the other leads to hypocrisy
• The book of Jonah explores themes of election, justice, and mercy
• Jonah is called by God to preach in Nineveh, but initially resists
• Jonah's reluctance stems from his knowledge of God's gracious nature
• Jonah's reluctance to forgive the people of Nineveh, considering their history with his people
• Jonah separating justice from mercy and wanting revenge against the Ninevite's
• Jonah's desire to decide who is worthy of mercy and forgiveness
• Jonah fleeing God's plan and presence by boarding a ship to Tarshish
• The cultural context of ancient times, where gods were believed to be tied to specific areas or regions
• Jonah runs from God and gets on a boat to escape
• The sailors are terrified as a storm comes up, but Jonah knows the storm is punishment for his disobedience
• Jonah tells the sailors to throw him overboard so they can be saved
• Some interpret Jonah's offer to be thrown into the sea as an attempt to sacrifice himself to the Canaanite god of the sea, yam.
• The sailors in the story, like Jonah, believe a storm can be placated by offering sacrifices to a specific god.
• Instead of sacrificing to "yam", the sailors cry out to the Lord (Yahweh) for deliverance.
• The word "Lord" is often translated from the Hebrew word "Yahweh", which is the covenant name of God.
• The sailors' confession, "You have done as you pleased, Lord", reflects an understanding of God's sovereignty and power.
• This confession should be attributed to Jonah, but it comes from the lips of the pagan sailors.
• The speaker discusses a passage in scripture where people are described as fearing the Lord
• The fear of the Lord is contrasted with being afraid of a storm or physical danger
• The speaker explains that to fear the Lord means to have awe and worship for God, not just a feeling of fear or dread
• The Old Testament scriptures are referenced, including Proverbs, which states that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.
• The worship and sacrifice of the sailors to Jonah, showing a deeper sense of fear and reverence
• The use of "fear" in the text to convey a sense of worshipful devotion

• Jesus welcomes and loves those considered immoral or broken
• Jesus includes everyone in the kingdom, regardless of background or status
• Expanding God's mercy to more people than initially presumed
• Challenging disciples' assumptions about who should be included in God's message
• Jesus and the disciples are surrounded by Jewish leaders who shout "crucify him"
• During Jesus' trial, a Roman centurion makes a statement about Jesus being the Son of God
• The centurion's recognition of Jesus as the Son of God is seen as a fulfillment of expectations about who should make this acknowledgment
• God's sovereign choice in choosing Jesus is discussed and contrasted with human preferences and expectations
• The discussion concludes with a reflection on how all these elements come together
