[1889.62 → 1919.60] Good morning.
[1919.60 → 1949.60] Thank you.
[1949.60 → 1979.60] Thank you.

[2009.60 → 2039.58] Thank you.
[2039.58 → 2069.58] Thank you.
[2069.58 → 2099.56] Thank you.
[2099.58 → 2129.56] I called, I called,
[2129.56 → 2159.54] Thank you.
[2159.54 → 2189.52] Thank you.
[2189.54 → 2219.52] Thank you.
[2219.54 → 2249.54] Thank you.
[2249.54 → 2279.52] Thank you.
[2279.54 → 2309.54] Thank you.
[2309.54 → 2339.52] Thank you.
[2339.54 → 2369.52] Thank you.
[2369.54 → 2399.52] Thank you.
[2399.54 → 2429.52] Do a blessing.
[2429.52 → 2459.52] I have a little something to do,
[2459.52 → 2489.50] 피� those, he'll,
[2489.50 → 2493.94] Rough crowd? No, just two kids like potato chips. What else, you guys, what else can you make with
[2493.94 → 2503.44] this? One of my wife's favourite things is mashed potatoes. Oh, your mom makes that. Look at this.
[2503.50 → 2511.92] I have this book that I brought from home. 500 potato recipes. 500 ways. We only named three.
[2512.88 → 2517.08] There are 500 ways you can make a potato. Scallop potatoes, that's another good one.
[2517.08 → 2522.42] You know what else is crazy about potatoes? I looked up a few things. Hey guys, you want to paint it?
[2524.80 → 2529.22] There are other crazy things I've done with potatoes over the years. Did you know you can use a potato
[2529.22 → 2535.76] to soothe a burn? If you have an Bowie on, you can use it to soothe that. I even looked up a recipe,
[2535.94 → 2543.60] you can make deodorant out of potatoes. Right? I mean, maybe it's better smelling than some things.
[2543.60 → 2548.52] I even looked up, there was, what else did I find on the internet? All kinds of crazy stuff.
[2548.72 → 2556.90] I learned that the potato was the very first vegetable people grew in space. Not this potato, but.
[2558.58 → 2565.74] Right? Isn't that crazy? Who knew that? It's just a potato. It can be 500 recipes. Furthermore, it can grow in space.
[2565.74 → 2574.20] It can do all these great things. Sometimes the most simple, normal things can be used for amazing
[2574.20 → 2581.26] things. Sometimes the most unsuspecting, that's kind of a big word, God can use for great, great things.
[2581.34 → 2586.34] So we're going to talk a little bit more about that today, how God chose a special person who was
[2586.34 → 2592.68] super normal, but he wasn't normal because God used him for great things. Yeah? Okay, let's stand, and we'll
[2592.68 → 2596.00] do the blessing, and then we'll talk some more about that at children's worship time.
[2598.22 → 2602.24] Okay, we're going to raise our hands with the congregation. Ready?
[2602.24 → 2606.52] The Lord be with you. And also with you.
[2606.60 → 2608.10] Okay. Time.
[2622.68 → 2637.72] Good morning. I'm Steve, an elder here. Pleased to lead me in prayer this morning.
[2640.54 → 2646.28] Eternal God, we come before you again this Sunday morning as a group of believers united in you.
[2646.28 → 2652.78] A group of people with a wide variety of emotions and feelings. Some of us come with joy, with reasons
[2652.78 → 2659.48] to be thankful, some with a deep sense of contentment. Others have concerns and worries, are sad and are
[2659.48 → 2665.08] weary, are burdened and frustrated. We are your people, and we know that in the end we need to trust
[2665.08 → 2671.60] that you'll make all things right. But Lord, we are also a fallen people who live in, are, and
[2671.60 → 2676.32] influenced by the world around us. We live in a world that bombards us with many messages.
[2677.20 → 2682.16] We are told to put on our head down and keep on working and if we just try hard enough,
[2683.36 → 2689.40] we will, if we never give up, we keep fighting to strive to attain our goals. Eternal God, remind us
[2689.40 → 2694.38] again this morning that the work has already been done on the cross, that you have paid the price for
[2694.38 → 2699.24] us and that rather than striving, you call us to a life of submission, obedience, and trust.
[2699.24 → 2705.72] Help us to let go of our many gods that we set up and worship in our lives and instead love you with
[2705.72 → 2710.60] all our heart, with all our soul, with all our mind, with all our strength, and to love our neighbours
[2710.60 → 2717.02] as ourselves. Loving God, we confess that at times we are selective in who we consider our neighbour.
[2717.54 → 2723.26] We pick and choose who we feel most comfortable with. Help us to see the needs of all those around us
[2723.26 → 2728.74] and to reach out with words and actions. Grant us the ability to heal rather than through wound.
[2729.24 → 2735.08] To build up rather than tear down. To be quicker to listen than to speak and open our hands in
[2735.08 → 2740.28] generosity rather than holding tight into the abundance we have. Forgive us our shortcomings.
[2741.56 → 2747.32] Father, we pray for our world, our nation, our province, and our communities. We pray for an end of
[2747.32 → 2754.20] the war in Israel, between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and the resulting human tragedy. The scale of violence and
[2754.20 → 2760.04] destruction is hard for us to comprehend. We pray for the resolution end of the ongoing war in Russia
[2760.04 → 2766.28] with Ukraine. We pray for the many refugees who have been forced to leave their homes and countries
[2766.28 → 2773.48] and start lives in new countries. And we bring all the leaders, those who govern before you. We pray that
[2773.48 → 2779.32] you bless them and guide them as they work towards solutions that we face, or the many challenges that
[2779.32 → 2786.36] we face in this world. We also continue to bring the concerns and joys of our church family before you.
[2787.00 → 2792.52] We pray those in our church body who struggle with their health, both physical and mental. We pray for
[2792.52 → 2798.44] strength and comfort for those who have lost family and friends. Lord, comfort them and all send a
[2798.44 → 2804.84] message of a measure of your healing grace. We pray for Greta Buyers and the rest of the family as
[2804.84 → 2814.04] her mom is in palliative care. We pray for Mini Free, mom of Brenda, Linda, and Jody, as Mini's cancer has
[2814.60 → 2821.24] returned, and she'll be starting chemotherapy this week. We pray for Rosita as she continues to struggle
[2821.24 → 2828.84] with her health. We pray for comfort for the Must family as Margaret Must's dad, Ted Vanderhoek, has
[2828.84 → 2834.68] passed away, and they prepare for the funeral service this coming week. We are thankful
[2834.68 → 2841.32] CY Kisser has come home after recently spending nine days in hospital. We pray for continuous strength and
[2841.32 → 2848.76] healing for CY. And we pray for Frank and Sylvia Welding's daughter Kim and their husband Ryan and their
[2848.76 → 2855.16] prematurely born son, Grayson. And we pray for all those who suffer in silence. We bring them a measure of
[2855.16 → 2861.96] your healing power. Lord, help us to remember that you're always there for us, that you call us to follow your
[2861.96 → 2870.68] teaching, to live in fellowship and communion with you and one another. And in all things, pray continually. Be with
[2870.68 → 2876.76] Pastor Kevin as he leads us this morning. Lord, thank you for his willingness to share his gifts, talents, and insights
[2876.76 → 2884.60] with us here at Emmanuel. And we ask you bless him and his message this morning. Hear our prayers, both spoken
[2884.60 → 2897.16] and unspoken. We pray this all in your great and holy name. Amen.
[2897.16 → 2912.18] Good morning, everyone. It's good to be here with you all. I was reminded right after I left at the
[2912.18 → 2916.28] opening of the service that I forgot one announcement. And that is that this coming
[2916.28 → 2921.24] Saturday, a group of people are going to be leading worship at Sun ridge Gardens, just up the hill at a
[2921.24 → 2926.92] complex where a few of our members live. And so they'll be leading worship there next week, Saturday, I believe at
[2926.92 → 2933.58] 2 p.m. All are welcome to join them for that, too. So if you want to join a nice little worship service at Sun ridge
[2933.58 → 2941.08] Gardens, please remember that as well. Today, we're going to be looking at a fairly challenging topic in the world
[2941.08 → 2949.08] today, and a passage of scripture that is equally challenging. But let's be honest, what passage in this sermon series
[2949.08 → 2956.38] throughout Romans has not been challenging, right? Here's the question of the day. What is fair?
[2957.70 → 2963.36] What is fair? Now, this is a question that's been echoed throughout history, or at least recent history.
[2963.80 → 2969.02] There are many good quotes throughout time about the concept of fairness, but one of my favourites
[2969.02 → 2975.56] actually comes from the comic strip Calvin and Hobbes. Calvin says to his dad,
[2975.56 → 2982.04] why can't I stay up late? You guys get to. It's not fair. To which his dad replies, the world isn't fair,
[2982.20 → 2987.96] Calvin, which he then grumbles away, saying, I know, but why isn't ever unfair in my favour?
[2989.00 → 2992.80] Good old Calvin and Hobbes, teaching philosophy to young kids for a long time.
[2994.04 → 2999.20] See, everybody thinks of fairness in some shape or form. We think of fairness in the workplace.
[2999.20 → 3005.52] We think of it in our families. We think of it in our athletics. We even think of it politically.
[3006.88 → 3012.56] Jonathan Haidt, he's the author of a book called The Righteous Mind, Why Good People Are Divided by
[3012.56 → 3017.42] Politics and Religion. He keenly highlights that in the Western society, whether you're on the right or
[3017.42 → 3023.50] the left, you value fairness. It just looks differently depending on what side you find yourself on. He says,
[3023.50 → 3030.66] everyone cares about fairness, but there are two major kinds. On the left, fairness often implies
[3030.66 → 3036.24] equality, but on the right, it means proportionality. People should be rewarded in proportion to what they
[3036.24 → 3042.36] contribute, even if that guarantees unequal outcomes. I'm not here to debate one side or the
[3042.36 → 3051.54] other. Both have merits, both have faults, but the point is this. Both value fairness.
[3051.54 → 3058.10] It's an underlying concept, no matter where you land on that spectrum. Our text today, Romans 9,
[3058.26 → 3064.98] 14 to 29, it concerns itself with eternal fairness, and it's a passage that's caused many questions.
[3065.32 → 3071.04] It's about election, predestination, and the connotations and realities of this concept
[3071.04 → 3078.52] in our lives, and so let's open up our Bibles and see why. You've got your Bibles now. Please open it
[3078.52 → 3083.38] up to Romans 9. You can also open up your Bible apps, of course. If you don't have a Bible with you,
[3083.42 → 3087.50] I strongly encourage you, grab one from the back, because we are going to be looking at this passage
[3087.50 → 3091.90] and going back to it over and over again, and the words aren't always going to be on the screen
[3091.90 → 3099.16] behind me. But keep that Bible open. Follow along with me. This time it will be behind me. Romans 9,
[3099.16 → 3100.82] 14 to 29 says this,
[3100.82 → 3111.04] What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Not at all. For he says to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I
[3111.04 → 3117.90] have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion. It does not therefore depend
[3117.90 → 3126.30] on human desire or effort, but on God's mercy. For Scripture says to Pharaoh, I raised you up for this
[3126.30 → 3131.76] very purpose, that I might display my power in you, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the
[3131.76 → 3139.74] earth. Therefore, God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens who he wants to harden.
[3141.54 → 3146.06] One of you will say to me, Then why does God still blame us? For who is able to resist his will?
[3146.28 → 3153.64] But who are you, a human being, to talk to God? Shall what is formed say to the one who formed it,
[3153.64 → 3158.56] why did you make me like this? Doesn't the potter have the right to make out the same lump of clay,
[3159.02 → 3165.02] some pottery for special purposes and some for common use? What if God, although choosing to
[3165.02 → 3170.58] show his wrath and make his power known, bore with great patience the objects of his wrath,
[3171.30 → 3178.28] prepared for destruction? What if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects
[3178.28 → 3185.92] of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory? Even us, whom he also called, not only from the Jews,
[3186.04 → 3192.72] but also from the Gentiles. As he says in Hosea, I will call them my people who are not my people. I will
[3192.72 → 3197.96] call her my loved one who is not my loved one. And in the very place where it was said to them,
[3198.02 → 3205.18] you are not my people, there they will be called children of the living God. Isaiah cries out concerning
[3205.18 → 3211.18] Israel, though the number of the Israelites be like the sand by the sea, only the remnant will be saved,
[3211.74 → 3219.40] for the Lord will carry out his sentence on earth with speed and finality. It is just as Isaiah said
[3219.40 → 3225.18] previously, unless the Lord Almighty has left us descendants, who would have become, or we, sorry,
[3225.18 → 3231.62] would have become like Sodom? We would have become like Gomorrah. The word of the Lord.
[3231.62 → 3244.72] Now, this passage starts with the very question we've been looking at. Is God unjust? Unjust means
[3244.72 → 3254.90] unfair. Just is fair. Fair is just. So, is God fair? Or rather, is God unfair? Is it fair that God saves
[3254.90 → 3264.42] some, but not others? Worse, is it fair that God chooses to save some, but not others? Now, this is a
[3264.42 → 3269.32] question that Paul anticipates his readers asking, and so he gets ahead of it, in fact, and he asks it
[3269.32 → 3278.96] himself. He asks on behalf of the doubters, is God unfair? And his answer, perhaps somewhat uncomfortably,
[3278.96 → 3285.86] is actually fairly clear. Listen to how Paul answers this question, straight from our text today,
[3286.16 → 3294.50] verses 15 to 18. Is God unfair? Paul says, no, not at all. He then quotes Exodus 33, 19, and he says,
[3294.84 → 3301.30] God will have mercy on whom he has mercy, and God will have compassion on whom he has compassion.
[3301.30 → 3312.08] He continues, and he says, salvation does not depend on human desire or effort, but only on God's mercy.
[3313.32 → 3318.70] And then he uses an example from the Old Testament, again from Exodus, and explains that God used Pharaoh
[3318.70 → 3324.62] for this very purpose, that God might display his power in you, and that his name might be proclaimed
[3324.62 → 3331.60] in all the earth. Paul then concludes this little chunk by simply stating that God has mercy on whom
[3331.60 → 3340.02] he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to harden. So what does all this mean? What does the
[3340.02 → 3346.94] answer that Paul gives here in Romans 9 mean to us today? And how can we take comfort in this answer?
[3348.66 → 3354.50] Today, my prayer is that we will come away with a clearer picture of this beautiful, yet perhaps
[3354.50 → 3361.66] uncomfortable truth, that it is not unfair. It's a double negative, so hear and read that correctly.
[3362.42 → 3370.82] It is not unfair that some, through God's sovereignty and mercy, are chosen by grace through Christ Jesus.
[3371.06 → 3380.78] It is not unfair that some, through God's sovereignty and mercy, are chosen by grace through Christ Jesus.
[3380.78 → 3388.24] And we're going to look at three ways that help frame this reality for us today, and hopefully that helps
[3388.24 → 3396.10] shape this answer a little clearer by the end. The first is this. God is sovereign.
[3398.08 → 3406.48] We are not. That means God sees all and has ultimate authority, power, and control over the created
[3406.48 → 3415.68] universe. We do not. Not only do we not, we don't come close. We can't even control our toddlers,
[3416.22 → 3425.04] or our finances, or our ankles when the pavement's slightly uneven. God is sovereign. We are not.
[3426.38 → 3430.18] Verse 20 and 21 of our text, Paul gets very blunt with this reality. He says,
[3430.18 → 3436.40] But who are you, a human being, to talk back to God? Shall what is formed say to the one who formed it,
[3436.52 → 3442.18] why did you make me like this? Doesn't the potter have the right to make out the same lump of clay,
[3442.50 → 3449.92] some pottery for special purposes, and some for common use? John Calvin, he's equally blunt about
[3449.92 → 3458.74] this. He says, monstrous, surely, is the madness of the human mind that it is more disposed to charge
[3458.74 → 3467.70] God with unrighteousness than to blame itself for blindness. Or to maybe 2023, that quote up a bit.
[3468.32 → 3475.80] It's outrageously insane that we think it makes more sense to blame God with being unfair than to blame
[3475.80 → 3486.48] ourselves for being so blind to sin. God is God. We are not. God is immortal. We all die. God is just.
[3486.48 → 3494.40] We are broken. God is love. We are selfish. God is almighty. We are weak. God is creator.
[3495.44 → 3505.30] We are created. God is the potter. We are the clay. God is God. We are not.
[3507.00 → 3512.68] This is such an important reality for us to wrap our heads around when we engage this discussion.
[3512.68 → 3520.50] And even if it's impossible to actually fully comprehend it, the opposite of doing so, choosing
[3520.50 → 3527.10] to ignore it or to minimize it or to forget that God is sovereign altogether is madness.
[3527.10 → 3537.56] When we resist God as God, when we choose to minimize that reality, when we rebel against his goddess,
[3538.06 → 3543.38] we make the exact same mistake that Adam and Eve made in the garden all over again.
[3544.48 → 3550.34] We are but creatures God created. And unless we see ourselves in that light,
[3550.34 → 3559.16] we elevate ourselves into these little deities, and we seek the knowledge of good and evil instead of the truth
[3559.16 → 3572.80] that God is God. But still, we dare to ask, is God just? Is God unfair?
[3572.80 → 3588.90] God created everything. He created reality. That means that God gets to define reality.
[3590.88 → 3598.42] God gets to define what reality is. Now, this brushes up against our worldview here in the West
[3598.42 → 3604.20] because we want to define reality. We want to define what morality is. We want to define what
[3604.20 → 3610.72] righteousness is. We want equality or proportionality. Furthermore, we want equal outcomes or equal opportunities.
[3610.90 → 3618.02] But to what end? And for whom? See, our world is pushing us to move towards a collective greater good.
[3618.58 → 3622.70] And that's what secular humanism sort of is. Always striving to be better than before.
[3623.16 → 3627.16] Better today than you were yesterday. And that sounds good and maybe even is good.
[3627.16 → 3634.84] But who defines what is better? Better from what? Or to where? Or to what end? Or for what people?
[3635.66 → 3643.56] Or through what lens? We're told to make this world a better place, but beyond the algorithms that
[3643.56 → 3651.96] control what you see and hear online, who chooses what is good? And how do they decide that?
[3651.96 → 3660.40] We can't put our hope in humanity's concept of good or bad because all of humanity falls short of the
[3660.40 → 3668.56] righteousness of God. In a world that is totally depraved, looking within ourselves or our systems or even
[3668.56 → 3673.58] other people for what is good will always come up short. It is doomed to fail.
[3673.58 → 3684.02] Apart from God, questions of morality, questions of justice, questions of fairness or righteousness,
[3684.20 → 3692.24] they all fall apart. We cannot ask these questions apart from God because God created reality and
[3692.24 → 3702.86] therefore God defines reality. God defines morality. And that is glorious. That is glorious.
[3702.86 → 3710.42] The glorious truth is we are not gods and the future does not depend on or lie in our incapable hands.
[3710.72 → 3717.96] What we do will not affect the ultimate eternal outcome of Christ's second coming where he will fully
[3717.96 → 3725.22] redeem the universe and usher in the new heaven and the new earth for all time. Only God created the
[3725.22 → 3735.78] world and when we sinned we broke it. Only he defines and fulfills how to save it. Only he could come into this
[3735.78 → 3742.60] world both fully God and fully man and live the life we should have lived. Only he could have died the death
[3742.60 → 3748.60] that we all deserve to die in order to save us. Not because we deserve it but because he is merciful.
[3748.60 → 3757.08] Only he could raise from the dead again because only he has the power over life and death. And only he
[3757.08 → 3763.84] could offer us that grace. Offer us the grace that we get because of his life, death, and resurrection.
[3763.84 → 3779.14] God is love. And so he defines what love is. God is truth. And so he defines what ultimate truth is.
[3780.76 → 3790.38] God is just. Which means that this question of whether God is fair or not is absurd because God defines
[3790.38 → 3797.68] what is fair. So the big question for us, and it's a question we're going to ask several times today is
[3797.68 → 3810.08] this. Can you trust him with his definition of fair? So first, God is sovereign. Second, God is merciful.
[3811.44 → 3818.68] Now Paul frames this whole conversation, this whole text today with God's mercy. Right out of the gate,
[3818.68 → 3825.14] verse 15, Paul quotes Exodus and says that God will show mercy and compassion on whomever he chooses.
[3825.94 → 3834.46] This whole text today, which is so often viewed with judgment or ridicule, it's misunderstood
[3834.46 → 3840.48] primarily because we don't frame it with the same lens that Paul does here.
[3840.48 → 3851.02] mercy reigns and God does all things, even hardening some people's hearts to show his patience and his
[3851.02 → 3861.28] mercy. Read verse 16 with me again. It does not therefore depend on human desire or effort, but God's
[3861.28 → 3868.08] mercy. So again, Paul is pointing out that all of this, salvation, justice, mercy, it's up to God
[3868.08 → 3875.14] and it's up to his choosing, not our longings, not our longings, not our efforts, not anything we do
[3875.14 → 3883.20] or wish for or perhaps, and I think for some of us this is the kicker, not even what we desire to be true.
[3884.96 → 3891.88] It is not up to human desire or effort, but only on God's mercy.
[3891.88 → 3898.88] The canons of Dort, it's one of those confessions that our church and denomination use to help
[3898.88 → 3905.04] summarize scripture and sort of aid us in understanding theology. It has this to say,
[3905.34 → 3908.80] article 6 of part 1 says this, it's a bit of a chunk, so follow along here.
[3909.36 → 3914.78] The fact that some receive from God the gift of faith within time and that others do not
[3914.78 → 3921.64] stems from his eternal decree, for all his works are known to God from eternity. Acts 15, 18 and
[3921.64 → 3926.88] Ephesians 1, 11 say that. In accordance with this decree, God graciously softens the hearts,
[3926.88 → 3934.82] however hard, of the elect or those he chooses and inclines them to believe. But by a just judgment,
[3934.96 → 3941.16] God leaves in their wickedness and hardness of heart those who have not been chosen. And this is
[3941.16 → 3950.20] especially, and in this especially, is disclosed to us God's act, unfathomable, as merciful as it is just,
[3950.92 → 3958.40] of distinguishing people equally lost. This is the well-known decree of election and reprobation
[3958.40 → 3966.98] revealed in God's word. Again, God defines reality. God defines justice. And so even if our brains can't
[3966.98 → 3975.82] grasp this, God in his mercy both hardens hearts and softens them. Paul uses the story of Pharaoh to
[3975.82 → 3981.16] highlight this. In the next verse, verse 17, it says this, for scripture says to Pharaoh, I raised you
[3981.16 → 3987.64] up for this very purpose, that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in
[3987.64 → 3995.10] all the earth. This is a question that gets asked by all ages. I've been asked this question by parents,
[3995.10 → 4001.16] by youth, even by my own kids in my time here. The question, why did God harden Pharaoh's heart?
[4001.64 → 4008.56] Why didn't God just soften Pharaoh's heart? And the answer scripture gives us is that Pharaoh's heart
[4008.56 → 4014.70] needed to be hardened so that God could do two things. One, display his power, and two, and perhaps
[4014.70 → 4024.04] more importantly, have his name glorified in all the earth. God hardened Pharaoh's heart so that he,
[4024.04 → 4032.04] God, could save the people whom God had chosen. His people survived the exodus, escaped slavery and
[4032.04 → 4038.54] genocide from the Egyptians, and grew. The family line continued from Abraham to David and eventually
[4038.54 → 4048.06] came to Christ, who saved all nations. Now, maybe we don't understand all the why's and the how's,
[4048.06 → 4054.84] but scripture tells us that God hardened Pharaoh's hearts so that his people, the royal Davidic line,
[4055.16 → 4060.74] could survive all the way to Christ, and his redemption plan could end in Christ's life,
[4061.06 → 4070.00] death, and resurrection, offering grace for all nations. God's plan ends for all people
[4070.00 → 4079.04] so his name could be proclaimed by all people over all the earth. This passage that we read today,
[4079.14 → 4085.36] this Romans 9 passage, is not meant for us to compare God's wrath against God's grace and pit
[4085.36 → 4091.88] them against one another. This is a passage, and in fact, the whole narrative of scripture is a testament
[4091.88 → 4101.24] to one thing only, the grace and mercy found in Jesus. Grace is held high here. Mercy is the focal
[4101.24 → 4105.70] point throughout this whole book, this whole book of Romans, and if you've been following along in this
[4105.70 → 4113.32] servant series, I pray that you've seen this. Romans has pointed emphatically to the fact that it is all
[4113.32 → 4120.02] about grace. In this letter so far, you can see this behind me, Paul highlights that grace comes
[4120.02 → 4128.20] to those who don't deserve it. That grace is more abundant than sin. That grace breaks the power of
[4128.20 → 4135.64] sin and death. That grace is unbeatable. Nothing can defeat God's grace. That grace is undeserved by those
[4135.64 → 4144.54] who receive it. That is our text today. This is not a passage where we're meant to get stuck in asking if
[4144.54 → 4155.96] God is fair or not. This is a passage meant to highlight how unbelievably unfair it is that God chooses to save
[4155.96 → 4166.36] anyone. This passage, once again, is meant to show us how high and deep and wide and far the love of God is
[4166.36 → 4172.78] and how merciful His actions are to those whom He calls His children.
[4178.66 → 4181.16] Some want God just to save everyone.
[4183.30 → 4186.64] They think maybe that would be the fairest.
[4188.26 → 4194.54] But sin needs justice. It's not fair if people do terrible things and are not held responsible for
[4194.54 → 4201.04] them. Our society actually gets this. It's a place where cancel culture reigns right now.
[4202.06 → 4206.16] To a fault, we understand that bad actions deserve consequences.
[4207.36 → 4210.16] If God just saves everyone, He is not just.
[4212.46 → 4220.08] Or, people want God to save everyone who chooses Him. At least everyone's got a shot.
[4220.08 → 4227.02] But the problem is, no one would choose God without His intervention.
[4230.42 → 4236.50] I'll give you an example. I think most of us are self-aware enough to think of that sin in our hearts
[4236.50 → 4242.74] right now that we keep choosing over and over. I think most of us are self-aware enough to think
[4242.74 → 4247.90] of that sin in our lives that we just can't seem to shake. No matter how hard we choose to,
[4247.90 → 4259.46] we still choose it. Maybe it's pride. Maybe it's pornography. Maybe it's gossip. Maybe it's gluttony.
[4260.08 → 4266.58] Maybe it's the pursuit of wealth or the pursuit of power or the pursuit of status. Maybe it's
[4266.58 → 4274.44] envy. Maybe it's apathy. But many of you are self-aware enough to know that there is sin in your life
[4274.44 → 4277.54] that you continuously choose over God.
[4281.18 → 4282.94] Many of you are self-aware enough
[4282.94 → 4284.76] that that sin
[4284.76 → 4288.02] has either only been overcome by God
[4288.02 → 4290.54] or will only be overcome
[4290.54 → 4292.04] by God's intervention.
[4293.62 → 4296.38] It will not be because you choose to get over it.
[4299.04 → 4300.84] Many of you know that truth already.
[4300.84 → 4302.76] And to those of you who don't,
[4303.82 → 4305.98] maybe pride's rooted a little deeper than we thought.
[4310.18 → 4316.18] Knowing there are sins out there that you keep choosing over God is why God simply can't show mercy
[4316.18 → 4317.70] to those who choose Him.
[4318.54 → 4320.86] Because no one would ever choose Him.
[4322.00 → 4324.82] No one would ever choose Him first without His intervention,
[4325.26 → 4327.06] without God coming to you first.
[4327.06 → 4331.04] Our world is too depraved.
[4332.12 → 4333.34] Sin runs too deep.
[4333.98 → 4335.10] Which is why
[4335.10 → 4337.40] the clean slate
[4337.40 → 4339.30] of grace and mercy
[4339.30 → 4341.42] granted to us by God,
[4341.56 → 4342.34] our Father,
[4342.50 → 4343.82] through Jesus Christ
[4343.82 → 4344.88] in His life,
[4345.22 → 4345.44] death,
[4345.60 → 4346.36] and resurrection
[4346.36 → 4348.52] is so unbelievably wonderful
[4348.52 → 4350.30] because it crushes
[4350.30 → 4351.58] that sin.
[4352.30 → 4353.42] It crushes
[4353.42 → 4354.96] that sin
[4354.96 → 4356.96] that so easily entangles.
[4357.88 → 4358.90] Those sins
[4358.90 → 4360.08] that you just thought of
[4360.08 → 4361.38] are wiped away
[4361.38 → 4363.62] due to the mercy
[4363.62 → 4364.62] and love
[4364.62 → 4365.48] and grace
[4365.48 → 4367.84] of Jesus' gospel truth.
[4367.96 → 4368.94] In order for people
[4368.94 → 4370.38] to get free from sin,
[4371.14 → 4372.40] God must choose
[4372.40 → 4373.56] to grant them mercy.
[4375.04 → 4376.20] But in order
[4376.20 → 4378.22] for the wages of sin
[4378.22 → 4379.76] to be death,
[4380.60 → 4382.22] God's justice against sin
[4382.22 → 4383.20] must also prevail.
[4383.20 → 4387.32] God does what He does
[4387.32 → 4388.28] for the good
[4388.28 → 4389.44] of His creation
[4389.44 → 4390.70] and its final healing
[4390.70 → 4391.68] and redemption.
[4392.22 → 4393.08] He sees all
[4393.08 → 4393.92] and in His sovereignty
[4393.92 → 4395.56] has shown His mercy.
[4396.82 → 4398.14] To question God
[4398.14 → 4398.88] and His election,
[4399.04 → 4399.16] though,
[4399.22 → 4400.18] is to question
[4400.18 → 4402.10] that exact redemption plan
[4402.10 → 4403.02] that He has laid out.
[4404.02 → 4404.86] So please,
[4404.98 → 4406.28] I am not telling you
[4406.28 → 4407.58] to stop wrestling with this.
[4407.58 → 4409.52] I am not telling you
[4409.52 → 4410.74] to stop asking questions
[4410.74 → 4411.36] about this.
[4411.90 → 4412.34] Please,
[4412.50 → 4413.70] ask your questions.
[4414.40 → 4415.30] Wrestle with this.
[4415.70 → 4417.36] Engage this conversation.
[4417.90 → 4418.78] But do so
[4418.78 → 4419.70] with the framework
[4419.70 → 4420.52] that in order
[4420.52 → 4421.52] for God
[4421.52 → 4422.42] to be God,
[4423.50 → 4424.98] He's going to have answers
[4424.98 → 4425.78] that are beyond
[4425.78 → 4426.94] our understanding
[4426.94 → 4427.78] of this eternity.
[4428.94 → 4429.54] And so again,
[4429.90 → 4430.40] our question
[4430.40 → 4431.38] coming out of this
[4431.38 → 4433.56] is can you trust Him
[4433.56 → 4435.56] with those answers?
[4438.56 → 4439.52] So number one,
[4439.62 → 4440.40] God is sovereign.
[4440.62 → 4441.04] Number two,
[4441.14 → 4441.90] God is merciful.
[4442.36 → 4443.04] And finally,
[4443.24 → 4443.66] thirdly,
[4444.12 → 4444.82] something we've actually
[4444.82 → 4445.24] been covering
[4445.24 → 4445.84] this whole time
[4445.84 → 4446.28] is this.
[4446.88 → 4447.70] God's kingdom
[4447.70 → 4449.58] is not defined
[4449.58 → 4450.14] by you,
[4451.08 → 4452.42] but by God.
[4454.30 → 4455.36] From way back
[4455.36 → 4455.90] in Genesis,
[4456.12 → 4456.74] God's promise
[4456.74 → 4457.46] was always
[4457.46 → 4458.32] that there would be
[4458.32 → 4459.08] a people
[4459.08 → 4460.18] specially chosen
[4460.18 → 4461.04] by God.
[4462.00 → 4462.62] Pastor Chris
[4462.62 → 4463.58] read this last week
[4463.58 → 4464.08] in his sermon,
[4464.20 → 4464.82] Romans 9,
[4464.88 → 4465.30] verse 8,
[4465.44 → 4466.28] where it says this,
[4467.22 → 4467.98] in other words,
[4468.52 → 4469.58] it is not the children
[4469.58 → 4470.54] by physical descent
[4470.54 → 4471.50] who are God's children,
[4471.80 → 4472.86] but it is the children
[4472.86 → 4473.72] of the promise
[4473.72 → 4474.40] who are regarded
[4474.40 → 4475.72] as Abraham's offspring.
[4477.78 → 4478.50] God's kingdom
[4478.50 → 4479.24] was not designed
[4479.24 → 4479.88] by birth,
[4480.36 → 4481.16] but by God.
[4482.08 → 4482.86] This was part
[4482.86 → 4483.52] of God's covenant
[4483.52 → 4484.02] to Abraham,
[4484.16 → 4485.44] part of His redemption plan
[4485.44 → 4487.22] to redeem the world.
[4488.00 → 4488.34] However,
[4488.46 → 4489.46] it's particularly
[4489.46 → 4490.50] important for us
[4490.50 → 4490.96] to see that
[4490.96 → 4491.84] whether we look back
[4491.84 → 4492.42] to Genesis
[4492.42 → 4493.56] and Exodus
[4493.56 → 4494.80] and the Old Testament
[4494.80 → 4495.56] within the nation
[4495.56 → 4496.14] of Israel,
[4496.34 → 4497.98] or we skip ahead here
[4497.98 → 4498.86] to Romans,
[4498.98 → 4499.72] to the New Testament,
[4499.82 → 4500.94] after Jesus' life,
[4501.30 → 4502.10] death, and resurrection,
[4502.58 → 4504.22] apart from God choosing,
[4505.42 → 4505.84] there would be
[4505.84 → 4506.74] no chosen people.
[4508.48 → 4510.08] There can't be chosen people
[4510.08 → 4511.34] if God doesn't choose.
[4512.92 → 4513.86] Now, this is huge
[4513.86 → 4516.02] because being a chosen people,
[4516.14 → 4517.90] being chosen by God,
[4517.90 → 4519.28] gets to the heart
[4519.28 → 4520.80] of our identities.
[4521.82 → 4522.46] God tells us
[4522.46 → 4524.24] over and over again
[4524.24 → 4525.00] in His Word
[4525.00 → 4525.94] that He has chosen
[4525.94 → 4526.78] His people.
[4526.88 → 4527.98] It is throughout Scripture.
[4528.80 → 4529.32] We see that
[4529.32 → 4530.90] in Deuteronomy 14.2.
[4532.26 → 4534.34] We see it in Psalm 33.12.
[4534.92 → 4535.80] There's a list here.
[4536.08 → 4536.58] I'm not going to read
[4536.58 → 4536.90] all of them,
[4537.00 → 4538.38] but Deuteronomy 14.2.
[4538.62 → 4539.78] The Lord has chosen you
[4539.78 → 4540.38] to be a people
[4540.38 → 4541.92] for His treasured possession.
[4542.32 → 4543.24] Psalm 33.12.
[4543.32 → 4544.24] The people whom
[4544.24 → 4545.08] He has chosen
[4545.08 → 4546.28] as His heritage.
[4546.28 → 4547.76] Isaiah 43.20.
[4548.18 → 4548.70] To give drink
[4548.70 → 4550.42] to my chosen people.
[4551.10 → 4552.12] John 15.16.
[4552.56 → 4553.84] I chose you
[4553.84 → 4555.02] and appointed you.
[4555.34 → 4556.22] Ephesians 1.4.
[4556.50 → 4557.96] He chose us in Him
[4557.96 → 4558.98] before the foundation
[4558.98 → 4559.48] of the world.
[4559.78 → 4560.72] 1 Peter 2.9.
[4561.12 → 4563.24] But you are a chosen race,
[4563.34 → 4565.20] a people for His own possession.
[4565.82 → 4566.68] And according to this
[4566.68 → 4567.78] fun little Greek tool
[4567.78 → 4568.52] that I get to use
[4568.52 → 4569.48] for school right now,
[4569.68 → 4570.50] those are six
[4570.50 → 4573.26] of over 107 references.
[4573.26 → 4577.28] that Scripture speaks
[4577.28 → 4578.72] of the people God chooses.
[4580.04 → 4582.86] We belong to God.
[4583.88 → 4585.34] This is foundational
[4585.34 → 4586.36] to our identity.
[4587.74 → 4589.14] Our only comfort
[4589.14 → 4591.12] in life and in death
[4591.12 → 4593.30] is that we are not our own,
[4593.42 → 4595.34] but we belong body and soul
[4595.34 → 4596.78] in life and in death
[4596.78 → 4598.60] to our faithful Saviour,
[4598.78 → 4599.54] Jesus Christ.
[4599.54 → 4600.92] He has fully paid
[4600.92 → 4602.12] for all our sins
[4602.12 → 4603.34] with His precious blood
[4603.34 → 4605.26] and He has set us free
[4605.26 → 4606.04] from the tyranny
[4606.04 → 4606.66] of the devil.
[4607.02 → 4608.46] He also watches over us
[4608.46 → 4609.26] in such a way
[4609.26 → 4610.86] that not a hair
[4610.86 → 4612.24] can fall from our heads
[4612.24 → 4614.06] without the will
[4614.06 → 4615.30] of our Father
[4615.30 → 4616.20] in heaven.
[4618.08 → 4619.26] Our only comfort
[4619.26 → 4620.44] in this world
[4620.44 → 4621.54] is that our identities
[4622.18 → 4624.00] belong to God.
[4624.92 → 4627.08] We are chosen by Him.
[4627.08 → 4630.08] Our identities
[4630.08 → 4631.68] are not earned.
[4632.74 → 4633.94] They are not achieved.
[4634.82 → 4635.98] They are not won.
[4636.40 → 4637.38] They are not discovered.
[4637.90 → 4638.46] Our identities
[4638.46 → 4639.88] are given to us.
[4640.80 → 4642.48] They are not found within.
[4643.14 → 4644.44] They are found from Him.
[4645.08 → 4646.40] We belong to God
[4646.40 → 4647.56] fully known,
[4648.28 → 4649.22] fully loved,
[4650.10 → 4650.90] fully saved.
[4653.22 → 4654.94] Our faith is given to us
[4654.94 → 4656.06] once we see God
[4656.06 → 4657.20] for who He is.
[4657.44 → 4657.64] Sorry,
[4657.76 → 4659.36] once faith is given to us,
[4660.12 → 4661.12] once we see God
[4661.12 → 4662.24] for who He really is,
[4662.54 → 4663.48] full of grace,
[4663.86 → 4664.74] full of mercy,
[4665.30 → 4666.18] sovereignly reigning
[4666.18 → 4667.22] over His creation,
[4667.62 → 4668.32] moving towards
[4668.32 → 4669.26] the eternal hope
[4669.26 → 4670.56] found in His kingdom come
[4670.56 → 4671.72] and His kingdom coming,
[4672.08 → 4673.08] we can know
[4673.08 → 4674.80] that we belong to Him.
[4676.16 → 4676.80] And therefore,
[4677.04 → 4678.06] as our text says,
[4678.70 → 4679.44] make the riches
[4679.44 → 4680.24] of His kingdom
[4680.24 → 4682.02] known to those around us.
[4682.02 → 4683.80] So once again,
[4684.58 → 4686.04] can you trust
[4686.04 → 4688.66] that you belong to Him?
[4691.92 → 4693.84] It is not unfair
[4693.84 → 4695.22] that some,
[4695.64 → 4696.62] through God's sovereignty
[4696.62 → 4697.26] and mercy,
[4697.76 → 4699.50] are chosen by grace
[4699.50 → 4701.06] through Christ Jesus.
[4704.06 → 4704.76] You know,
[4704.78 → 4706.10] it's not uncommon
[4706.10 → 4708.30] for us to ask,
[4708.70 → 4709.82] is it unfair
[4709.82 → 4711.58] that God only chooses some?
[4711.58 → 4712.18] I get it.
[4712.28 → 4713.12] I wonder that myself,
[4713.20 → 4713.64] to be honest.
[4715.08 → 4716.24] But I think it's important
[4716.24 → 4717.28] to spin this question
[4717.28 → 4717.84] for a moment
[4717.84 → 4719.40] and ask this one instead.
[4721.12 → 4722.20] Is it fair
[4722.20 → 4724.86] that Jesus had to die
[4724.86 → 4725.46] for anyone?
[4727.06 → 4728.10] Is it fair
[4728.10 → 4729.60] that Jesus
[4729.60 → 4731.02] had to come down
[4731.02 → 4732.64] from the thrones of heaven,
[4733.60 → 4735.58] put on this skin costume
[4735.58 → 4736.80] that we call flesh,
[4737.98 → 4739.58] dwell in this corrupt world
[4739.58 → 4741.60] world that we've all cultivated,
[4742.48 → 4744.34] commit no sins of His own,
[4744.78 → 4745.94] but take on the sins
[4745.94 → 4747.50] not just of a few people,
[4747.74 → 4749.26] but of all of humanity
[4749.26 → 4751.00] throughout all history
[4751.00 → 4752.36] onto His shoulders,
[4753.28 → 4754.34] get whipped
[4754.34 → 4755.84] and flogged
[4755.84 → 4756.74] and beaten
[4756.74 → 4757.84] and pierced
[4757.84 → 4758.88] and spat on
[4758.88 → 4759.66] and ridiculed
[4759.66 → 4760.46] and mocked
[4760.46 → 4761.28] and stabbed
[4761.28 → 4762.56] and hung on a cross
[4762.56 → 4763.40] to die
[4763.40 → 4764.92] one of the most painful
[4764.92 → 4766.90] and most public deaths
[4766.90 → 4767.66] imaginable.
[4768.66 → 4770.04] Is it fair
[4770.04 → 4770.74] that Jesus
[4770.74 → 4771.66] had to do
[4771.66 → 4772.84] all of that
[4772.84 → 4774.22] to save anyone?
[4775.96 → 4777.18] Because He did.
[4778.32 → 4779.48] He lived
[4779.48 → 4780.46] that out.
[4782.34 → 4783.50] And then
[4783.50 → 4785.14] He miraculously
[4785.14 → 4785.90] rose again
[4785.90 → 4786.94] from the grave.
[4786.94 → 4790.28] He didn't simply
[4790.28 → 4791.10] do that.
[4791.44 → 4792.18] He did it
[4792.18 → 4792.66] out of His
[4792.66 → 4794.10] unconditional love
[4794.10 → 4795.52] for humanity
[4795.52 → 4796.24] and the world
[4796.24 → 4796.94] that He created.
[4797.06 → 4798.40] He was not angry.
[4798.54 → 4799.12] He was not bitter.
[4799.22 → 4800.04] He was not resentful.
[4800.10 → 4800.74] He was full
[4800.74 → 4801.78] of love
[4801.78 → 4802.80] and mercy.
[4806.36 → 4807.36] One last question
[4807.36 → 4808.82] before we conclude.
[4810.40 → 4811.36] If election
[4811.36 → 4812.68] is not up to us,
[4813.64 → 4814.36] if God
[4814.36 → 4815.52] chooses us,
[4815.58 → 4816.58] not the other way around,
[4816.58 → 4818.28] if choosing God
[4818.28 → 4819.34] was God's doing
[4819.34 → 4820.74] and not my responsibility,
[4821.70 → 4823.08] then what is
[4823.08 → 4823.86] my responsibility?
[4825.32 → 4826.90] If God chooses us
[4826.90 → 4828.26] and yet we are not robots,
[4829.36 → 4831.70] what is our responsibility?
[4833.72 → 4834.52] Pastor Chris
[4834.52 → 4835.06] is going to talk
[4835.06 → 4836.08] about that next week
[4836.08 → 4836.58] as we look
[4836.58 → 4837.10] at the end
[4837.10 → 4838.12] of chapter 9
[4838.12 → 4839.02] and the beginning
[4839.02 → 4840.24] of chapter 10.
[4843.34 → 4844.12] Everyone loves
[4844.12 → 4844.64] a cliffhanger.
[4844.64 → 4846.76] But for now,
[4846.82 → 4847.58] let's remember this.
[4848.98 → 4850.92] It is not unfair
[4850.92 → 4852.60] that some,
[4852.82 → 4853.34] through God's
[4853.34 → 4854.50] sovereignty and mercy,
[4854.96 → 4856.62] are chosen by grace
[4856.62 → 4858.26] through Christ Jesus.
[4859.52 → 4860.44] And in light
[4860.44 → 4861.30] of that reality,
[4861.70 → 4862.20] the reality
[4862.20 → 4862.90] which God,
[4863.14 → 4864.02] our Creator,
[4864.18 → 4865.02] has defined,
[4866.02 → 4867.52] our response
[4867.52 → 4868.42] should be
[4868.42 → 4869.20] these three things.
[4869.20 → 4870.58] one,
[4870.66 → 4871.04] we are called
[4871.04 → 4871.54] to gather,
[4872.20 → 4873.76] to be with His people
[4873.76 → 4875.18] and to worship Him.
[4875.74 → 4876.08] Remember,
[4876.22 → 4877.32] all good theology
[4877.32 → 4878.42] leads to doxology.
[4878.58 → 4879.28] All of this
[4879.28 → 4880.24] leads to us
[4880.24 → 4881.42] worshipping God.
[4881.50 → 4882.18] Your identity
[4882.18 → 4882.94] is in Him.
[4883.16 → 4883.98] Your salvation
[4883.98 → 4884.92] is in Him.
[4885.02 → 4885.62] Your hope
[4885.62 → 4886.72] is in Him.
[4887.64 → 4888.54] Let us gather
[4888.54 → 4889.94] and praise
[4889.94 → 4891.00] our God.
[4891.88 → 4892.28] Second,
[4892.38 → 4892.66] we're called
[4892.66 → 4893.10] to grow,
[4893.60 → 4894.26] to ask
[4894.26 → 4895.16] these questions
[4895.16 → 4895.84] that are hard
[4895.84 → 4897.04] and trust Him
[4897.04 → 4897.94] with the answers
[4897.94 → 4898.34] that maybe
[4898.34 → 4899.32] we don't understand.
[4900.20 → 4901.24] We can find
[4901.24 → 4902.84] rest and solitude
[4902.84 → 4904.10] in the answers
[4904.10 → 4905.28] we can comprehend.
[4906.40 → 4907.20] And I hope
[4907.20 → 4907.86] that we can find
[4907.86 → 4909.12] hope and trust
[4909.12 → 4910.30] and rest
[4910.30 → 4911.20] in the ones
[4911.20 → 4912.12] that maybe we can't.
[4913.82 → 4914.32] And finally,
[4914.46 → 4914.74] thirdly,
[4914.78 → 4915.22] we are called
[4915.22 → 4915.62] to go,
[4916.24 → 4917.72] to be present
[4917.72 → 4918.40] in our community
[4918.40 → 4919.14] and make
[4919.14 → 4919.84] the riches
[4919.84 → 4920.42] of His kingdom
[4920.42 → 4921.08] known to those
[4921.08 → 4921.70] around us
[4921.70 → 4923.28] in order
[4923.28 → 4924.18] that God
[4924.18 → 4925.06] can work
[4925.06 → 4925.68] through us
[4925.68 → 4926.90] and plant
[4926.90 → 4927.54] the gift
[4927.54 → 4928.30] of faith
[4928.30 → 4929.42] into others,
[4930.04 → 4930.56] others
[4930.56 → 4931.78] whom He has
[4931.78 → 4932.74] already called
[4932.74 → 4933.92] to be His people.
[4934.64 → 4934.88] Amen.
[4935.12 → 4935.56] Let me pray.
[4940.04 → 4941.06] Father in heaven,
[4941.90 → 4944.32] God,
[4944.40 → 4945.24] there are realities
[4945.24 → 4945.94] in this world
[4945.94 → 4946.66] that we cannot
[4946.66 → 4947.44] fully wrap
[4947.44 → 4948.28] our minds around.
[4949.46 → 4950.10] And God,
[4950.22 → 4951.38] sometimes we look
[4951.38 → 4952.48] at this world
[4952.48 → 4953.30] and we do ask
[4953.30 → 4953.74] ourselves,
[4953.92 → 4954.72] is this fair?
[4954.72 → 4956.58] is this just?
[4958.78 → 4959.76] But God,
[4960.34 → 4961.58] please instill
[4961.58 → 4962.26] in our hearts
[4962.26 → 4963.00] and our minds
[4963.00 → 4964.52] that You are God.
[4964.84 → 4966.14] You are sovereignly
[4966.14 → 4966.84] reigning over
[4966.84 → 4967.94] all Your creation
[4967.94 → 4970.02] and that this reality
[4970.02 → 4971.48] is defined by You,
[4971.94 → 4972.80] that love
[4972.80 → 4974.24] is defined by You,
[4974.30 → 4974.96] that trust
[4974.96 → 4975.66] is designed
[4975.66 → 4976.34] by You,
[4976.40 → 4976.98] that truth
[4976.98 → 4977.68] is designed
[4977.68 → 4978.22] by You,
[4978.94 → 4980.26] and that justice
[4980.26 → 4981.04] is designed
[4981.04 → 4981.48] by You.
[4981.48 → 4982.14] God,
[4982.20 → 4983.18] may that imprint
[4983.18 → 4984.18] upon our hearts
[4984.18 → 4985.64] and may we know
[4985.64 → 4986.32] without a shadow
[4986.32 → 4986.76] of a doubt
[4986.76 → 4988.44] that You are a God
[4988.44 → 4989.58] of mercy
[4989.58 → 4990.92] and a God
[4990.92 → 4991.48] of grace.
[4992.76 → 4993.20] Lord,
[4993.28 → 4994.48] we are so
[4994.48 → 4996.22] unbelievably grateful
[4996.22 → 4996.76] that You have
[4996.76 → 4997.96] called us Your own.
[4999.54 → 5000.16] And Lord,
[5000.22 → 5000.74] for those
[5000.74 → 5002.34] whom You have not called,
[5002.60 → 5003.64] whom we love dearly,
[5004.36 → 5005.82] we pray that You will
[5005.82 → 5006.84] plant that seed of faith
[5006.84 → 5007.56] into their hearts.
[5008.06 → 5009.00] May we be vessels
[5009.00 → 5009.96] for that,
[5010.10 → 5010.28] God.
[5011.38 → 5012.62] May You reach out
[5012.62 → 5013.10] to them.
[5015.44 → 5016.06] And Lord,
[5016.14 → 5016.82] may we know
[5016.82 → 5019.14] that You
[5019.14 → 5019.88] reign
[5019.88 → 5020.78] on the throne.
[5024.82 → 5025.26] God,
[5025.30 → 5026.28] we continue to ask You
[5026.28 → 5027.00] to forgive us
[5027.00 → 5027.84] our sins
[5027.84 → 5029.34] as we know You do.
