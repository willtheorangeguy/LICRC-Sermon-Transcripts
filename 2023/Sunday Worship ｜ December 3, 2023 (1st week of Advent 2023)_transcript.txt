[30.00 --> 32.00]  .
[60.00 --> 62.00]  .
[90.00 --> 92.00]  .
[92.00 --> 94.00]  .

[96.00 --> 98.00]  .
[98.00 --> 100.00]  .
[100.00 --> 102.00]  The word peace is common in most languages.
[102.00 --> 105.00]  People can talk about peace treaties or times of peace.
[105.00 --> 107.00]  It means the absence of war.
[107.00 --> 110.00]  And in the Bible, the word peace can refer to the absence of conflict,
[110.00 --> 114.00]  but it also points to the presence of something better in its place.
[114.00 --> 117.00]  In the Old Testament, the Hebrew word for peace is shalom.
[117.00 --> 120.00]  And in the New Testament, the Greek word is erene.
[120.00 --> 123.00]  The most basic meaning of shalom is complete or whole.
[123.00 --> 128.00]  The word can refer to a stone that has a perfect whole shape with no cracks.
[128.00 --> 133.00]  It can also refer to a completed stone wall that has no gaps and no missing bricks.
[133.00 --> 140.00]  Shalom refers to something that's complex with lots of pieces that's in a state of completeness, wholeness.
[140.00 --> 146.00]  It's like Job, who says his tents are in a state of shalom because he counted his flock and no animals are missing.
[146.00 --> 149.00]  This is why shalom can refer to a person's well-being.
[149.00 --> 154.00]  Like when David visited his brothers on the battlefield, he asked about their shalom.
[154.00 --> 160.00]  The core idea is that life is complex, full of moving parts and relationships and situations.
[160.00 --> 165.00]  And when any of these is out of alignment or missing, your shalom breaks down.
[165.00 --> 166.00]  Life is no longer whole.
[166.00 --> 167.00]  It needs to be restored.
[167.00 --> 172.00]  In fact, that's the basic meaning of shalom when you use it as a verb.
[172.00 --> 176.00]  To bring shalom literally means to make complete or restore.
[176.00 --> 180.00]  So Solomon brings shalom to the unfinished temple when he completes it.
[180.00 --> 187.00]  Or if your animal accidentally damages your neighbor's field, you shalom them by giving them a complete repayment for their loss.
[187.00 --> 190.00]  You take what's missing and you restore it to wholeness.
[190.00 --> 192.00]  The same goes for human relationships.
[192.00 --> 197.00]  In the book of Proverbs, to reconcile and heal a broken relationship is to bring shalom.
[197.00 --> 202.00]  And when rival kingdoms make shalom in the Bible, it doesn't just mean they stop fighting.
[202.00 --> 205.00]  It also means they start working together for each other's benefit.
[205.00 --> 211.00]  This state of shalom is what Israel's kings were supposed to cultivate and it rarely happened.
[211.00 --> 215.00]  So the prophet Isaiah, he looked forward to a future king, a prince of shalom.
[215.00 --> 218.00]  And his reign would bring shalom with no end.
[218.00 --> 226.00]  A time when God would make a covenant of shalom with his people and make right all wrongs and heal all that's been broken.
[226.00 --> 231.00]  This is why Jesus' birth in the New Testament was announced as the arrival of Eirene.
[231.00 --> 233.00]  Remember, that's the Greek word for peace.
[233.00 --> 236.00]  Jesus came to offer his peace to others.
[236.00 --> 239.00]  Like when he said to his followers, my peace I give to you all.
[239.00 --> 246.00]  The apostles claimed that Jesus made peace between messed up humans and God when he died and rose from the dead.
[246.00 --> 252.00]  The idea is that he restored to wholeness the broken relationship between humans and their creator.
[252.00 --> 257.00]  This is why the apostle Paul can say Jesus himself is our Eirene.
[257.00 --> 261.00]  He was the whole complete human that I am made to be but have failed to be.
[261.00 --> 264.00]  And now he gives me his life as a gift.
[264.00 --> 268.00]  And this means that Jesus' followers are now called to create peace.
[268.00 --> 277.00]  Paul instructed local churches to keep their unity through the bond of peace, which requires humility and patience and bearing with others in love.
[277.00 --> 287.00]  Becoming people of peace means participating in the life of Jesus who reconciled all things in heaven and on earth, restoring peace through his death and resurrection.
[287.00 --> 290.00]  So peace takes a lot of work.
[290.00 --> 293.00]  Because it's not just the absence of conflict.
[293.00 --> 300.00]  True peace requires taking what's broken and restoring it to wholeness, whether it's in our lives, our relationships or in our world.
[300.00 --> 313.00]  And that's the rich biblical concept of peace.
[313.00 --> 315.00]  Good morning.
[315.00 --> 321.00]  I want to just take a moment and welcome you to Emmanuel Church.
[321.00 --> 324.00]  Special welcome if you are a guest with us this morning.
[324.00 --> 325.00]  My name is Chris.
[325.00 --> 332.00]  I'm one of the pastors here and it's my privilege with these others to lead in our shared worship together this morning.
[332.00 --> 339.16]  morning. As you can see by looking around and by the video, today is the first Sunday of Advent.
[339.68 --> 347.10]  Advent is the season of waiting and anticipation prior to Christmas. And so this season we are
[347.10 --> 356.94]  going to enter into those four words of Advent with peace, hope, joy, and love and explore what
[356.94 --> 366.80]  it is that God has on offer for us by his spirit and by the coming of Jesus into the world. As we
[366.80 --> 370.88]  gather for worship, we do so as people who are called by God. And so I'm going to invite you,
[370.88 --> 374.30]  as you're able, to stand and we'll be welcomed into his presence.
[374.30 --> 392.88]  As we wait on God, he meets us here and we mark that by receiving his greeting. Grace, mercy,
[393.42 --> 398.36]  and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son, and our Savior,
[398.36 --> 404.28]  through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit. Amen. I invite you to turn to those
[404.28 --> 407.18]  around you in worship and welcome them in the name of Jesus.
[428.36 --> 449.44]  Welcome to the season of Advent, a season of being reminded of the birth of our Savior,
[450.08 --> 456.54]  a season of being reminded of who Jesus is, a season of waiting, anticipating the second coming of
[456.54 --> 462.96]  Christ, a season illuminating God's active hand and redemptive plan, a season of sitting in the
[462.96 --> 469.62]  tension of the now, not yet, where our Prince of Peace walks with us. Sing with us the song of Emmanuel

[993.26 --> 1000.54]  We ask for you to draw us closer, that your Holy Spirit saturates our soul for comfort and strength.
[1000.54 --> 1006.44]  Because God, if we're honest, this world is far from peace.
[1007.84 --> 1010.14]  At times we feel distant from you.
[1010.48 --> 1011.32]  We feel weak.
[1012.52 --> 1016.34]  Our life circumstances overwhelm us, and we cry out,

[1020.56 --> 1020.62]  Where are you, God?
[1023.94 --> 1029.20]  Where are you in the empty chair at the family Christmas gathering?
[1031.20 --> 1033.52]  Where are you in the hospital room?
[1036.60 --> 1039.50]  Where are you in the chaos of life?

[1111.16 --> 1123.56]  And let us sit in the silence amidst the chaos and the busy malls and the flashing lights.

[1157.88 --> 1178.40]  When peace like a river
[1178.40 --> 1183.34]  attendeth my way
[1183.34 --> 1191.26]  When sorrows like sea billows roll
[1191.26 --> 1195.94]  Whatever my lot
[1195.94 --> 1200.98]  Thou hast taught me to say
[1200.98 --> 1208.98]  It is well, it is well with my soul
[1208.98 --> 1218.90]  It is well with my soul
[1218.90 --> 1230.82]  It is well, it is well with my soul
[1230.82 --> 1236.82]  Though Satan should profit
[1236.82 --> 1240.82]  Though trials should come
[1240.82 --> 1248.74]  Let this blessed assurance control
[1248.74 --> 1254.68]  That Christ has regarded
[1254.68 --> 1259.14]  My helpless estate
[1259.14 --> 1263.74]  And has shed his own blood
[1263.74 --> 1266.74]  For my soul
[1266.74 --> 1274.66]  It is well, it is well
[1274.66 --> 1276.66]  With my soul
[1276.66 --> 1283.66]  It is well, it is well
[1283.66 --> 1286.66]  With my soul
[1286.66 --> 1294.32]  I sin, O the bliss
[1294.32 --> 1299.82]  Of this glorious thought
[1299.82 --> 1304.58]  My sin, not in part
[1304.58 --> 1307.58]  But the whole
[1307.58 --> 1312.62]  Is nailed to the cross
[1312.62 --> 1317.80]  And I bid no more
[1317.80 --> 1320.50]  Praise the Lord
[1320.50 --> 1326.50]  Praise the Lord, O my soul
[1326.50 --> 1332.42]  It is well, it is well
[1332.42 --> 1334.42]  With my soul
[1334.42 --> 1336.42]  With my soul
[1336.42 --> 1342.42]  It is well, it is well
[1342.42 --> 1344.42]  With my soul
[1344.42 --> 1346.42]  With my soul
[1346.42 --> 1352.42]  O Lord, grace the day
[1352.42 --> 1358.34]  When my faith shall be sigh
[1358.34 --> 1363.34]  The clouds be rolled back
[1363.34 --> 1366.34]  As the scrolls
[1366.34 --> 1370.34]  The trough shall resound
[1370.34 --> 1375.34]  And the Lord shall descend
[1375.34 --> 1378.26]  Even so
[1378.26 --> 1379.26]  Even so
[1379.26 --> 1381.26]  It is well
[1381.26 --> 1383.26]  With my soul
[1383.26 --> 1387.26]  It is well
[1387.26 --> 1389.26]  It is well
[1389.26 --> 1393.26]  With my soul
[1393.26 --> 1395.26]  With my soul
[1395.26 --> 1397.26]  With my soul
[1397.26 --> 1399.18]  It is well
[1399.18 --> 1400.18]  It is well
[1400.18 --> 1400.76]  It is well
[1400.76 --> 1402.18]  It is well
[1402.18 --> 1403.12]  It is well
[1403.12 --> 1405.30]  With my soul
[1427.26 --> 1451.38]  I cannot tell why he whom angels worship
[1451.38 --> 1459.86]  Should set his love upon the sons of men
[1459.86 --> 1467.00]  Or why as shepherd he should seek the wonders
[1467.00 --> 1474.92]  To bring them back they know not how or when
[1474.92 --> 1482.82]  But this I know that he was born of Mary
[1482.82 --> 1490.76]  When Bethlehem's manger was his only home
[1490.76 --> 1498.92]  And that he lived at Nazareth and labored
[1498.92 --> 1505.92]  And so the Savior, Savior of the world is come
[1505.92 --> 1513.74]  I cannot tell how silently he suffered
[1513.74 --> 1522.12]  As with his peace he graced the place of tears
[1522.12 --> 1529.10]  For how his heart upon the cross was broken
[1529.10 --> 1537.16]  The crown of pain to three and thirty years
[1537.16 --> 1544.18]  But this I know he heals the brokenhearted
[1544.18 --> 1551.62]  And stays our sin and clothes our lurking way
[1551.62 --> 1559.18]  And lifts the burden from the heavy laden
[1559.86 --> 1567.18]  For yet the Savior, Savior of the world is here
[1567.18 --> 1574.68]  I cannot tell how he will win the nations
[1574.68 --> 1582.18]  How he will claim his earthly heritage
[1582.70 --> 1589.60]  How satisfied the needs and aspirations
[1589.60 --> 1597.10]  Of east and west, of sinner and of sage
[1597.10 --> 1604.68]  But this I know, all flesh shall see his glory
[1604.68 --> 1612.04]  And he shall reap the harvest he has sown
[1612.04 --> 1620.04]  And some glad day his sun shall shine in splendor
[1620.04 --> 1627.04]  When he the Savior, Savior of the world is known
[1627.04 --> 1634.54]  I cannot tell how all the lands shall worship
[1634.54 --> 1642.04]  When at his bidding every storm is still
[1642.04 --> 1649.12]  Or who can say how great the jubilation
[1649.12 --> 1656.88]  When all the hearts of men with love are filled
[1656.88 --> 1663.88]  But this I know, all the skies will thrill with rapture
[1663.88 --> 1670.88]  And myriad, myriad human voices sing
[1670.88 --> 1678.38]  And earth to heaven and heaven to earth will answer
[1678.38 --> 1685.88]  At last the Savior, Savior of the world is King
[1685.88 --> 1692.88]  But this I know, all the skies will thrill with rapture
[1692.88 --> 1699.88]  And myriad, myriad human voices sing
[1699.88 --> 1707.88]  And earth to heaven and heaven to earth will answer
[1707.88 --> 1716.88]  At last the Savior, Savior of the world is King
[1716.88 --> 1718.94]  I invite you to be seated
[1718.94 --> 1730.72]  At this time in our shared worship life together
[1730.72 --> 1735.60]  We have the opportunity to participate in and witness
[1735.60 --> 1739.62]  A profession of faith from Adam and Rachel Smid
[1739.62 --> 1745.32]  In case you missed it, these kinds of things are awesome
[1745.32 --> 1746.54]  In the life of the church
[1746.54 --> 1751.20]  These kinds of events are a sign to us of God
[1751.20 --> 1752.78]  Still at work in the world
[1752.78 --> 1757.78]  As he opens hearts and changes minds
[1757.78 --> 1761.72]  And so the way that we mark that here in this church
[1761.72 --> 1764.54]  Is we invite the people up
[1764.54 --> 1766.16]  Who are going to make a profession of faith
[1766.16 --> 1768.50]  They're going to share a little bit of a story
[1768.50 --> 1770.32]  Or testimony, a word for us
[1770.32 --> 1773.44]  And then we have people who have been significant
[1773.44 --> 1776.88]  In their life of faith and in their discipleship
[1776.88 --> 1781.00]  Who will speak a word and share some of that story and journey
[1781.00 --> 1784.46]  And so to begin, I'm going to invite Adam and Rachel to the front
[1784.46 --> 1786.90]  They're going to come up
[1786.90 --> 1790.76]  And Adam is going to share a little bit
[1790.76 --> 1796.86]  You know, that feels about right
[1796.86 --> 1797.74]  Knowing you guys
[1797.74 --> 1804.62]  Morning church
[1804.62 --> 1811.22]  This morning I'm planning on reading Luke 8 verses 5 to 8
[1811.22 --> 1814.70]  As this is a meaningful verse to myself and Rachel
[1814.70 --> 1817.98]  A farmer went out to sow his seed
[1817.98 --> 1821.16]  As he scattered the seed, some fell along the path
[1821.16 --> 1824.56]  It was trampled on and the birds ate it up
[1824.56 --> 1826.92]  Some fell on the rocky ground
[1826.92 --> 1829.40]  And when it came up, the plants withered
[1829.40 --> 1831.00]  Because they had no moisture
[1831.00 --> 1833.80]  Other seed fell among the thorns
[1833.80 --> 1836.90]  Which grew up with it and choked the plants
[1836.90 --> 1839.76]  Still other seed fell on good soil
[1839.76 --> 1841.92]  It came up, yielded a crop
[1841.92 --> 1844.02]  A hundred times or more than it was sown
[1844.02 --> 1846.62]  This verse is important to us
[1846.62 --> 1849.20]  In that God called us to be disciples
[1849.20 --> 1852.60]  Spreading the word or the seed of the Lord
[1852.60 --> 1855.90]  You never know who your faith may impact
[1855.90 --> 1859.72]  But it's important to also not force others onto it
[1859.72 --> 1861.48]  Like a crop
[1861.48 --> 1864.48]  It is not up to me who allows the seed to grow
[1864.48 --> 1866.40]  But God, maker of all things
[1866.40 --> 1871.04]  Thank you
[1871.04 --> 1873.86]  If you guys don't know or couldn't figure that out
[1873.86 --> 1874.56]  Adam's a farmer
[1874.56 --> 1880.80]  Part of their story together
[1880.80 --> 1882.72]  That brings them to this place
[1882.72 --> 1886.98]  Is that we don't always get to see that seed bear fruit
[1886.98 --> 1888.56]  In the time that we would like it to
[1888.56 --> 1889.64]  Right?
[1889.70 --> 1891.78]  Or in the manner that we would expect it to
[1891.78 --> 1893.94]  And yet, God is faithful
[1893.94 --> 1895.46]  And here we are together
[1895.46 --> 1898.14]  To mark that, why don't you guys have a seat
[1898.14 --> 1899.26]  You don't have to stand up here anymore
[1899.26 --> 1900.94]  I know you love this part of it
[1900.94 --> 1904.26]  And then I'm going to invite John Kuypers to the front
[1904.26 --> 1908.24]  He's going to share a little bit of a testimony and story
[1908.24 --> 1910.38]  For Adam and Rachel too
[1910.38 --> 1911.10]  Up here, John
[1911.10 --> 1935.12]  Adam, it's evident to me that God caused our paths to cross
[1935.12 --> 1936.30]  A long time ago
[1936.30 --> 1940.22]  Youth camp is kind of where we made our first connection
[1940.22 --> 1944.36]  Our common interests and mechanics sparked a lifelong friendship
[1944.36 --> 1948.08]  You love any kind of mechanical machine
[1948.08 --> 1952.10]  And just absorb the physics behind the wheels and the gears
[1952.10 --> 1956.74]  Your mind was created by God that way
[1956.74 --> 1959.44]  And to me it's obvious that you honor God
[1959.44 --> 1963.26]  Through your God-given talents to the best of your abilities
[1963.26 --> 1966.22]  Adam, through the years I have prayed with you
[1966.22 --> 1967.76]  And for you many times
[1967.76 --> 1970.72]  I have prayed that you see God for who he is
[1970.72 --> 1974.98]  I have prayed that you find the strength you need from him day to day
[1974.98 --> 1978.88]  I have prayed that you learn to trust God with your future
[1978.88 --> 1981.28]  To trust God with finding you a life partner
[1981.28 --> 1986.08]  A friend that would always be by your side while you're on earth
[1986.08 --> 1988.50]  Rachel
[1988.50 --> 1990.26]  Honestly
[1990.26 --> 1994.46]  I don't know you all that well
[1994.46 --> 1995.70]  But as you know now
[1995.70 --> 1998.02]  I've been praying for you for a while
[1998.02 --> 1999.88]  I just didn't know it was you
[1999.88 --> 2004.62]  I knew that Adam was God's child
[2004.62 --> 2008.52]  I knew God had a plan for his life
[2008.52 --> 2011.66]  And I somehow knew that someone like you
[2011.66 --> 2014.00]  Would come around into Adam's life
[2014.00 --> 2015.94]  And that's how God works
[2015.94 --> 2017.12]  He's the master planner
[2017.12 --> 2020.20]  He's the one who motivates us
[2020.20 --> 2022.14]  The one who walks beside us
[2022.14 --> 2023.94]  And the one who carries us
[2023.94 --> 2026.40]  When we don't have the strength to walk on our own
[2026.40 --> 2030.18]  We don't always know God's reasons or his timing
[2030.18 --> 2032.36]  But as we get older
[2032.36 --> 2033.68]  We sometimes get to see
[2033.68 --> 2035.68]  Some of the things he had in mind
[2035.68 --> 2037.24]  For me
[2037.24 --> 2039.36]  This is one of those times
[2039.36 --> 2042.86]  I couldn't be prouder than I am today
[2042.86 --> 2044.58]  To stand up here and address it to you
[2044.58 --> 2048.66]  Adam and Rachel
[2048.66 --> 2052.90]  I'm happy beyond words that God put the two of you together
[2052.90 --> 2055.32]  I have no doubt that he would
[2055.32 --> 2056.12]  And he did
[2056.12 --> 2059.80]  And likewise I have no doubt
[2059.80 --> 2063.02]  That he will be with the both of you in your marriage
[2063.02 --> 2068.04]  And now as you stand here publicly and share your faith
[2068.04 --> 2072.42]  And that you will strive to keep God as the center of your lives
[2072.42 --> 2074.56]  I have no doubt
[2074.56 --> 2076.96]  That you will grow in faith
[2076.96 --> 2079.32]  And learn to trust in the master
[2079.32 --> 2080.26]  I have no doubt
[2080.26 --> 2084.24]  That you will learn to start and end your days with God
[2084.24 --> 2085.66]  I have no doubt
[2085.66 --> 2088.22]  That you will learn to lean on God
[2088.22 --> 2089.22]  Through your struggles
[2089.22 --> 2091.36]  I have no doubt
[2091.36 --> 2093.32]  That when the two of you
[2093.32 --> 2095.68]  Have trouble seeing eye to eye
[2095.68 --> 2097.18]  That you will look God in the eye
[2097.18 --> 2099.40]  And God will look back at you
[2099.40 --> 2100.38]  In your eyes
[2100.38 --> 2102.14]  With his favor
[2102.14 --> 2104.22]  Because he loves the both of you so much
[2104.22 --> 2106.80]  I have no doubt
[2106.80 --> 2109.20]  That God will teach you to love
[2109.20 --> 2111.82]  And that love is something you give
[2111.82 --> 2113.74]  Or it has no value
[2113.74 --> 2115.64]  I have no doubt
[2115.64 --> 2118.32]  That you will learn to be vessels of God's love
[2118.32 --> 2120.36]  And no doubt that you will learn
[2120.36 --> 2121.48]  The more you give
[2121.48 --> 2122.84]  From your heart
[2122.84 --> 2124.12]  The more you will
[2124.12 --> 2126.00]  The more God will bless you
[2126.00 --> 2127.96]  I have no doubt
[2127.96 --> 2130.18]  That through your good works
[2130.18 --> 2133.10]  You will plant seeds of faith in others
[2133.10 --> 2135.94]  Just as you plant crops in your fields
[2135.94 --> 2136.82]  And watch them grow
[2136.82 --> 2139.58]  I have
[2139.58 --> 2142.28]  A prayer for both of you
[2142.28 --> 2146.40]  Some of you have heard it before
[2146.40 --> 2149.58]  Adam and Rachel
[2149.58 --> 2152.12]  May you see with your eyes
[2152.12 --> 2153.44]  May you hear with your ears
[2153.44 --> 2155.84]  May you learn to quiet the noises around you
[2155.84 --> 2157.76]  Quiet the thoughts in your minds
[2157.76 --> 2158.54]  And know this
[2158.54 --> 2160.62]  God doesn't leave you
[2160.62 --> 2162.52]  God won't punish you
[2162.52 --> 2164.32]  And God doesn't forget you
[2164.32 --> 2166.70]  He's carried the cross for you
[2166.70 --> 2167.74]  So you wouldn't have to
[2167.74 --> 2168.82]  Young there and died
[2168.82 --> 2170.22]  So you wouldn't have to bear it
[2170.22 --> 2170.92]  And he rose
[2170.92 --> 2172.68]  So you can live with him
[2172.68 --> 2173.72]  He calls your names
[2173.72 --> 2175.18]  Adam and Rachel
[2175.18 --> 2177.30]  So listen in silence
[2177.30 --> 2178.64]  You will hear him calling
[2178.64 --> 2179.64]  Listen
[2179.64 --> 2180.88]  You will hear him whisper
[2180.88 --> 2182.02]  In the quiet of the night
[2182.02 --> 2183.92]  You'll hear it from the depths of your pains
[2183.92 --> 2184.98]  You see
[2184.98 --> 2186.32]  God can only use you
[2186.32 --> 2188.36]  When you are in need of him
[2188.36 --> 2190.70]  And with his arms wide open
[2190.70 --> 2192.16]  He calls you by your names
[2192.16 --> 2195.02]  So let this be my prayer to you
[2195.02 --> 2197.18]  You will remain his child
[2197.18 --> 2198.42]  You will become strong
[2198.42 --> 2200.04]  You will become powerful
[2200.04 --> 2200.98]  In Jesus name
[2200.98 --> 2201.82]  Take his spirit
[2201.82 --> 2203.76]  He left it here for you
[2203.76 --> 2205.26]  Take hold and never let go
[2205.26 --> 2206.62]  God will always love you
[2206.62 --> 2208.54]  He will always fill your voice
[2208.54 --> 2212.30]  Sorry
[2212.30 --> 2213.92]  And he will
[2213.92 --> 2214.72]  And you will
[2214.72 --> 2216.82]  And he will show you the path
[2216.82 --> 2218.30]  And you will always be his children
[2218.30 --> 2221.20]  May the grace of God fill you up
[2221.20 --> 2222.98]  May the love of God fill your void
[2222.98 --> 2225.18]  May the peace of God fill your mind
[2225.18 --> 2226.14]  With songs of love
[2226.14 --> 2228.00]  Take his spirit and run
[2228.00 --> 2229.36]  Nothing can stop you now
[2229.36 --> 2230.14]  Amen
[2230.14 --> 2232.28]  Trust in him to change your heart
[2232.28 --> 2233.90]  Love others as you love yourselves
[2233.90 --> 2235.24]  Take his spirit and run
[2235.24 --> 2237.32]  Nothing is stopping you now
[2237.32 --> 2239.70]  May the grace of God fill you up
[2239.70 --> 2241.56]  May the love of God fill your hearts
[2241.56 --> 2244.56]  May the peace of God fill your minds
[2244.56 --> 2245.66]  With songs and joy
[2245.66 --> 2247.82]  Take his spirit and run
[2247.82 --> 2250.24]  Nothing is going to stop you now
[2250.24 --> 2252.10]  Nothing will stop you now
[2252.10 --> 2254.02]  And nothing can stop you now
[2254.02 --> 2255.02]  Amen
[2255.02 --> 2263.36]  Thanks John
[2263.36 --> 2273.34]  I'm not going to take too much time
[2273.34 --> 2275.36]  And add more than what John has said
[2275.36 --> 2277.50]  But Rachel did ask
[2277.50 --> 2278.44]  If I would be the one
[2278.44 --> 2280.02]  Who speaks on her behalf
[2280.02 --> 2282.84]  I've gotten to know Adam and Rachel
[2282.84 --> 2285.86]  In part through pre-marriage counseling
[2285.86 --> 2287.80]  And the things that were said there
[2287.80 --> 2288.40]  Are confidential
[2288.40 --> 2290.24]  So there's no stories coming out of that
[2290.24 --> 2293.66]  And I also got to know Adam and Rachel
[2293.66 --> 2297.92]  As they participated in a Christianity Explored class
[2297.92 --> 2300.06]  With me and a group of other people
[2300.06 --> 2302.40]  Where we dug into
[2302.40 --> 2309.16]  We dug into the foundational truths
[2309.16 --> 2311.02]  Of our Christian faith together
[2311.02 --> 2314.18]  And one thing I learned very quickly
[2314.18 --> 2316.92]  Is that Rachel is not afraid
[2316.92 --> 2319.88]  To ask any question that comes on her mind
[2319.88 --> 2323.92]  And she's always not the most couth
[2323.92 --> 2326.06]  About how she asks those questions
[2326.06 --> 2329.82]  And I'm going to be honest with you
[2329.82 --> 2333.30]  I love that about Rachel
[2333.30 --> 2335.38]  If you know me
[2335.38 --> 2336.74]  Or if you've been in any teaching
[2336.74 --> 2337.52]  That I have done
[2337.52 --> 2340.58]  I depend on questions like that
[2340.58 --> 2342.80]  To drive our time together forward
[2342.80 --> 2344.52]  And so when you find someone
[2344.52 --> 2346.48]  Who's genuinely interested
[2346.48 --> 2348.10]  Who's genuinely engaged
[2348.10 --> 2350.56]  And who wants to learn
[2350.56 --> 2352.66]  It is a beautiful experience
[2352.66 --> 2353.86]  For the rest of us in the room
[2353.86 --> 2356.64]  And so thank you for your vulnerability in that
[2356.64 --> 2359.18]  And for your time in our class
[2359.18 --> 2360.94]  And for letting me get to know you
[2360.94 --> 2362.54]  And I'll stop making eye contact with you
[2362.54 --> 2363.46]  Because I know you told me
[2363.46 --> 2364.38]  That that would make you cry
[2364.38 --> 2367.74]  We are here today
[2367.74 --> 2370.86]  Because God is at work in and through us
[2370.86 --> 2373.54]  And we mark that with this profession of faith
[2373.54 --> 2374.56]  And so I'm going to invite you guys
[2374.56 --> 2375.40]  Back up to the front
[2375.40 --> 2377.72]  I'm going to ask you four questions
[2377.72 --> 2380.76]  And invite you to respond
[2380.76 --> 2383.78]  You know the response
[2383.78 --> 2385.80]  I do with God's help
[2385.80 --> 2388.12]  But we'll get there
[2388.12 --> 2389.74]  Before we do that
[2389.74 --> 2391.20]  And while you're standing here
[2391.20 --> 2392.14]  I just wanted to share
[2392.14 --> 2394.04]  One scripture verse with you
[2394.04 --> 2395.04]  Nicely done
[2395.04 --> 2395.92]  If you missed that
[2395.92 --> 2396.88]  I'm going to point this out
[2396.88 --> 2398.60]  She just ripped the tag off
[2398.60 --> 2399.88]  Of Adam's brand new shirt
[2399.88 --> 2404.68]  Oh it's the recycle tag even
[2404.68 --> 2405.52]  Excellent
[2405.52 --> 2408.96]  All of this fits so perfectly
[2408.96 --> 2410.40]  I'm glad we got to witness it
[2410.40 --> 2415.22]  In 1 John 3
[2415.22 --> 2417.64]  The apostle writes
[2417.64 --> 2421.00]  See what great love the Father has lavished on us
[2421.00 --> 2423.72]  That we should be called children of God
[2423.72 --> 2426.62]  And that is what we are
[2426.62 --> 2429.40]  Share that with you
[2429.40 --> 2431.86]  Because that is what you are
[2431.86 --> 2436.42]  Lavishly loved children of God our Father
[2436.42 --> 2441.44]  That truth has always been declared over you
[2441.44 --> 2444.64]  And now you stand in its truth
[2444.64 --> 2446.38]  In your profession of faith
[2446.38 --> 2449.02]  And so we're going to ask you four questions
[2449.02 --> 2451.86]  To mark this profession today
[2451.86 --> 2454.18]  And so Adam and Rachel
[2454.18 --> 2457.10]  Do you believe that Jesus Christ
[2457.10 --> 2458.32]  Is the Son of God
[2458.32 --> 2459.56]  Sent to redeem the world?
[2460.36 --> 2461.80]  Do you love and trust Him
[2461.80 --> 2463.62]  As the one who saves you from your sin?
[2463.62 --> 2465.46]  And do you with repentance and joy
[2465.46 --> 2467.68]  Embrace Him as Lord of your life?
[2468.64 --> 2468.94]  2
[2468.94 --> 2470.86]  Do you believe that the Bible
[2470.86 --> 2471.76]  Is the word of God
[2471.76 --> 2473.34]  Revealing Christ and His redemption
[2473.34 --> 2475.22]  And that the confessions of this church
[2475.22 --> 2477.00]  Faithfully reflect this revelation?
[2478.34 --> 2478.90]  3
[2478.90 --> 2481.48]  Do you accept the gracious promises of God
[2481.48 --> 2483.10]  Sealed to you in your baptism?
[2483.56 --> 2485.08]  And do you affirm your union
[2485.08 --> 2486.54]  With Christ and His church
[2486.54 --> 2488.94]  Which your baptism signifies?
[2488.94 --> 2490.34]  4
[2490.34 --> 2493.04]  Do you promise to do all you can
[2493.04 --> 2494.46]  With the help of the Holy Spirit
[2494.46 --> 2495.74]  To strengthen your love
[2495.74 --> 2496.80]  And commitment to Christ

[2498.26 --> 2500.14]  In the life of this church family

[2502.32 --> 2504.76]  And do you join with the people of God
[2504.76 --> 2507.16]  In doing the work of the Lord everywhere?
[2508.08 --> 2509.08]  Adam, first you
[2509.08 --> 2510.02]  What is your answer?
[2510.34 --> 2511.34]  I do with God's help
[2511.34 --> 2513.52]  And Rachel, what is your answer?
[2513.86 --> 2514.94]  I do with God's help
[2514.94 --> 2515.74]  Amen
[2515.74 --> 2516.82]  Amen
[2516.82 --> 2522.68]  In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2522.68 --> 2526.02]  I now welcome you to the privileges of
[2526.02 --> 2528.14]  Full communion, full fellowship
[2528.14 --> 2530.18]  In the life of this body
[2530.18 --> 2532.16]  I welcome you to full participation
[2532.16 --> 2533.76]  In the life of this church
[2533.76 --> 2534.94]  To its responsibilities
[2534.94 --> 2537.30]  Its joys and its sufferings
[2537.30 --> 2539.32]  May the God of peace
[2539.32 --> 2541.14]  Who through the blood of the eternal covenant
[2541.14 --> 2542.26]  Brought back from the dead
[2542.26 --> 2543.84]  Our Lord Jesus Christ
[2543.84 --> 2545.40]  The great shepherd of the sheep
[2545.40 --> 2547.48]  Equip you with everything good
[2547.48 --> 2548.88]  For doing his will
[2548.88 --> 2550.64]  And may he work in us
[2550.64 --> 2552.08]  What is pleasing to him
[2552.08 --> 2553.94]  Through Jesus Christ our Lord
[2553.94 --> 2556.64]  To him be the glory forever and ever
[2556.64 --> 2557.82]  And all God's people said
[2557.82 --> 2558.48]  Amen
[2558.48 --> 2561.80]  Congregation, church family
[2561.80 --> 2563.10]  I'm going to invite you to stand
[2563.10 --> 2565.36]  Because you also have a part to play
[2565.36 --> 2568.62]  In this ongoing story of God at work
[2568.62 --> 2571.04]  And so I'm going to ask you a question
[2571.04 --> 2572.72]  You see it there on the screen
[2572.72 --> 2575.42]  And invite you to respond
[2575.42 --> 2578.68]  With the words there
[2578.68 --> 2582.52]  Do you, people of God
[2582.52 --> 2585.06]  Promise Adam and Rachel
[2585.06 --> 2588.54]  Your love, encouragement, and prayers?
[2588.54 --> 2596.14]  See there was some editing actions
[2596.14 --> 2596.78]  Going on there
[2596.78 --> 2601.70]  I'm going to, at this time
[2601.70 --> 2602.50]  You may have a seat
[2602.50 --> 2604.16]  Invite Daryl Wind
[2604.16 --> 2605.18]  To come up to the front
[2605.18 --> 2607.30]  He is an elder in our church
[2607.30 --> 2608.74]  He's just going to congratulate you
[2608.74 --> 2609.70]  He has a certificate
[2609.70 --> 2610.96]  That marks this occasion
[2610.96 --> 2613.44]  And two gifts for you
[2613.44 --> 2619.14]  Because you have so much free time, Adam
[2619.14 --> 2620.72]  I thought I'd give you two books to read
[2620.72 --> 2632.64]  At this time
[2632.64 --> 2634.10]  We're also going to pray over you guys
[2634.10 --> 2634.94]  And so I'm going to ask you
[2634.94 --> 2636.18]  Just to come down to the front
[2636.18 --> 2637.92]  In the center of the stage there
[2637.92 --> 2640.42]  That's what pockets are for
[2640.42 --> 2641.88]  I know you don't have pockets
[2641.88 --> 2642.96]  That's why he has pockets
[2642.96 --> 2643.28]  Yeah
[2643.28 --> 2645.94]  And I'm also going to invite
[2645.94 --> 2648.08]  Any elders or family members
[2648.08 --> 2649.36]  Mentors, leaders
[2649.36 --> 2651.12]  People who have journeyed
[2651.12 --> 2652.24]  With Adam and Rachel
[2652.24 --> 2653.14]  Together
[2653.14 --> 2654.36]  To come on up to the front
[2654.36 --> 2656.10]  We're going to lay hands on them
[2656.10 --> 2657.56]  In our prayer together
[2657.56 --> 2661.78]  If you remain seated
[2661.78 --> 2662.86]  And are so moved
[2662.86 --> 2663.50]  We encourage you
[2663.50 --> 2664.48]  Just to hold out your hand
[2664.48 --> 2666.02]  As a sign that the Spirit too
[2666.02 --> 2667.52]  Is moving in our midst
[2667.52 --> 2668.84]  And flowing through us all
[2668.84 --> 2670.12]  To Adam and Rachel
[2670.12 --> 2670.68]  Here together
[2670.68 --> 2673.50]  Let's pray
[2673.50 --> 2678.16]  Lord our God
[2678.16 --> 2680.32]  We thank you for your word
[2680.32 --> 2681.24]  And your Spirit
[2681.24 --> 2682.26]  Through which we know
[2682.26 --> 2683.14]  Jesus Christ
[2683.14 --> 2684.38]  As Lord and Savior
[2684.38 --> 2686.86]  May Adam and Rachel
[2686.86 --> 2688.26]  In their profession today
[2688.26 --> 2689.50]  Never cease to wonder
[2689.50 --> 2691.00]  At what you have done for them
[2691.00 --> 2693.32]  Help them to continue
[2693.32 --> 2694.76]  Firmly in the faith
[2694.76 --> 2696.76]  To bear witness to your love
[2696.76 --> 2698.06]  And to let the Holy Spirit
[2698.06 --> 2699.00]  Shape their lives
[2699.00 --> 2700.22]  In all that they do
[2700.22 --> 2701.82]  Take Adam
[2701.82 --> 2702.72]  And take Rachel
[2702.72 --> 2703.28]  Good Shepherd
[2703.28 --> 2704.70]  Into your care
[2704.70 --> 2705.52]  That they may
[2705.52 --> 2706.80]  Loyally endure
[2706.80 --> 2708.34]  Opposition in serving you
[2708.34 --> 2709.56]  And may we
[2709.56 --> 2710.72]  With all your children
[2710.72 --> 2711.40]  Live together
[2711.40 --> 2712.04]  In the joy
[2712.04 --> 2712.92]  And the power
[2712.92 --> 2714.24]  Of your Holy Spirit
[2714.24 --> 2715.86]  We ask this
[2715.86 --> 2716.42]  Lord Jesus
[2716.42 --> 2717.16]  In the hope
[2717.16 --> 2718.48]  Of your coming again
[2718.48 --> 2719.70]  Amen
[2719.70 --> 2721.06]  Amen
[2721.06 --> 2745.54]  Please stand and join us
[2745.54 --> 2746.24]  In song together
[2746.24 --> 2747.20]  As we celebrate
[2747.20 --> 2748.48]  Adam and Rachel's
[2748.48 --> 2749.38]  Profession of faith
[2749.38 --> 2779.38] 
[2779.38 --> 2786.20]  This my only comfort in my life and in my death
[2786.20 --> 2792.44]  You have fully paid for all my sins and all my debt
[2792.44 --> 2796.96]  And even when I struggle to believe
[2796.96 --> 2803.06]  With your precious blood you set me free
[2803.06 --> 2815.36]  I am not my own but belong body and soul
[2815.36 --> 2828.76]  In my life and in death to you Lord Christ my Lord
[2828.76 --> 2834.80]  You've preserved my life in such a way that without you
[2834.80 --> 2841.04]  Not a hair can fall from me unless you will it too
[2841.04 --> 2846.32]  Even when I'm lost in desperation
[2846.32 --> 2852.36]  All things work together for my salvation
[2852.36 --> 2863.92]  I am not my own but belong body and soul
[2863.92 --> 2876.36]  In my life and in death to you Lord Christ my Lord
[2876.36 --> 2906.34]  Always by your Holy Spirit you assure me
[2906.34 --> 2912.82]  Of eternal life and make me willing and ready
[2912.82 --> 2917.86]  Even when I can't see my way through
[2917.86 --> 2923.94]  From now on to always live for you
[2923.94 --> 2937.38]  I am not my own but belong body and soul
[2937.38 --> 2949.94]  In my life and in death to you Lord Christ my Lord
[2949.94 --> 2961.76]  I am not my own but belong body and soul
[2961.76 --> 2974.46]  In my life and in death to you Lord Christ my Lord
[2974.46 --> 2986.28]  I am not my own but belong body and soul
[2986.28 --> 2999.46]  In my life and in death to you Lord Christ my Lord
[2999.46 --> 3009.48]  I am not my own but belong body and soul
[3009.48 --> 3011.28]  In my life and soul
[3011.28 --> 3013.46]  I am not my own but belong body and soul
[3013.46 --> 3031.84]  It is on.
[3032.66 --> 3033.22]  Good morning.
[3033.72 --> 3036.06]  My name is Clem, and I'm one of the deacons here.
[3036.06 --> 3044.12]  Before I start the offering, I notice there's a lot of jackets and stuff out in the foyer.
[3045.20 --> 3050.28]  Dina Nikolai from First Christian Reformed Church in Vancouver called me last night
[3050.28 --> 3055.16]  and expressed her thankfulness for your giving.
[3055.50 --> 3058.76]  You heard the cry, and you guys answered the cry once again.
[3059.14 --> 3060.30]  So thank you very much.
[3060.30 --> 3067.76]  Okay, the first offering is for the church budget and ministries.
[3068.68 --> 3072.76]  If you would like to make certain that your donation is going to the first offering,
[3073.28 --> 3075.30]  it needs to be marked as budget.
[3075.82 --> 3078.58]  You can use an envelope to indicate this.
[3080.38 --> 3084.18]  There are envelopes in the backs of some of the chairs in front of you.
[3084.18 --> 3088.42]  The reason for this is that we only pass along one bag,
[3088.94 --> 3092.40]  and cash and coupons all go to the special offering.
[3094.64 --> 3099.62]  The special offering today is for Cascade Christian Counseling,
[3100.28 --> 3105.30]  a nonprofit that has provided affordable counseling for close to 40 years.
[3105.98 --> 3110.16]  They offer a faith-based approach to helping clients heal.
[3110.16 --> 3114.98]  The counselors are Christians and will work from a Christian worldview.
[3116.62 --> 3120.50]  They utilize their own faith to lead in the counseling process.
[3121.06 --> 3125.96]  Their hope is that you will feel cared for, heard, and deeply understood.
[3127.00 --> 3132.26]  The word counsel appears 133 times throughout the books of the Bible.
[3132.26 --> 3140.42]  At this point, I usually like to include a verse at the end of the special offering,
[3140.70 --> 3143.22]  and it speaks to the special offering.
[3143.76 --> 3149.36]  So 1 Thessalonians 5, verse 14.
[3149.96 --> 3154.64]  And we urge you, brothers, admonish the idle, encourage the faint-hearted,
[3155.34 --> 3158.12]  help the weak, and be patient with them all.
[3158.12 --> 3177.56]  Before you I kneel, my Master and Maker,
[3178.56 --> 3182.12]  to offer the work of my hands,
[3182.12 --> 3188.18]  For this is the day you've given your servant.
[3189.32 --> 3193.46]  I will rejoice and be God.
[3193.98 --> 3198.12]  For the strength I have to live and breathe,
[3199.34 --> 3204.12]  for each skill your grace has given me,
[3204.12 --> 3212.82]  For the needs and opportunities that will glorify your reign.
[3212.82 --> 3212.84]  For the needs and opportunities that will glorify your reign.
[3222.52 --> 3228.46]  Before you I kneel and ask for your goodness,
[3228.46 --> 3233.54]  To cover the work of my hands,
[3233.54 --> 3236.22]  For patience and peace,
[3236.22 --> 3239.12]  To shape all my labor,
[3240.06 --> 3244.26]  Your grace for thorns in my path,
[3244.74 --> 3249.48]  Flow within me like a living stream,
[3250.16 --> 3254.72]  Wear away the stones of pride and greed,
[3254.72 --> 3259.74]  Till your ways are dwelling deep in me,
[3259.74 --> 3264.10]  And the harvest of life is grown.
[3264.10 --> 3264.80]  For the Bethany andek,
[3264.80 --> 3264.94]  Go along.
[3264.94 --> 3265.92]  For Sext light on me like a living stream,
[3265.92 --> 3267.06]  andly nature willkinate new country.
[3267.68 --> 3268.12]  I will surround you with my needs andсти,
[3268.12 --> 3268.80]  Through the needs and pride.
[3269.00 --> 3269.86]  For the needs and i'm so blessed,
[3269.86 --> 3270.92]  For the needs and alerts,
[3270.92 --> 3275.26]  Give Meg
[3276.70 --> 3277.10]  How one ranks,
[3280.04 --> 3282.94]  To make more hopes and peace,
[3282.94 --> 3286.90]  A lifetime of dreams will this hongure.
[3287.74 --> 3292.36]  Where and�� are the ones in the long-game room.
[3292.36 --> 3322.34]  Thank you.
[3322.36 --> 3352.34]  Thank you.
[3352.36 --> 3354.36]  Thank you.
[3382.36 --> 3384.36]  Thank you.
[3392.36 --> 3393.28]  Good morning.
[3393.42 --> 3394.46]  Time for Kids' Corner.
[3394.64 --> 3399.26]  We get to see the kids age three to grade four.
[3399.36 --> 3399.96]  Come on up.
[3399.96 --> 3410.20]  Good morning.
[3413.14 --> 3414.06]  Good morning.
[3415.64 --> 3419.12]  I think the people in the back of the church want to make sure that you guys are all okay,
[3419.22 --> 3421.30]  so when I say good morning, do you think you guys can be loud?
[3422.34 --> 3423.22]  Good morning.
[3423.22 --> 3423.48]  Good morning.
[3424.82 --> 3426.02]  That's a bit better.
[3427.20 --> 3429.68]  Hey, today I got a question for you guys.
[3430.78 --> 3433.94]  Can you think of anything that is never ending?
[3435.70 --> 3436.18]  What?
[3438.34 --> 3439.20]  The sea?
[3439.54 --> 3440.16]  The sky?
[3440.66 --> 3441.42]  That's a good one.
[3442.80 --> 3443.48]  God's love?
[3443.54 --> 3446.08]  We're going to talk about that today, so you got the answer right away.
[3446.08 --> 3446.86]  That's pretty good.
[3448.02 --> 3448.80]  Anything else?
[3449.00 --> 3451.96]  Can you think of something that you want to never end?
[3453.88 --> 3454.24]  What?
[3455.94 --> 3456.26]  Rainbows.
[3456.68 --> 3457.30]  How about you?
[3458.68 --> 3460.56]  Your dog Chase, you want him to live forever?
[3460.76 --> 3461.44]  That's a good one.
[3461.56 --> 3461.88]  How about you?
[3463.26 --> 3465.18]  He wants candy to last forever.
[3465.32 --> 3466.04]  That's a good one.
[3466.58 --> 3470.26]  How about like on your birthday, like you're having your birthday day and you're having all kinds of fun.
[3470.30 --> 3473.08]  Do you ever think, oh, I hope this day never ends.
[3473.14 --> 3473.64]  Do you have that?
[3474.56 --> 3477.94]  Or when you're going camping or something with your family and you're having so much fun,
[3478.00 --> 3479.54]  you're like, oh, I hope this never ends.
[3481.58 --> 3482.58]  You get presents.
[3482.78 --> 3483.64]  Your friends are over.
[3484.20 --> 3484.50]  Yeah.
[3485.32 --> 3485.96]  How about you?
[3487.40 --> 3488.80]  Christmas, you want that to never end?
[3488.84 --> 3489.38]  How about yourself?
[3494.54 --> 3495.10]  That's right.
[3495.10 --> 3496.52]  You want your pets to live forever.
[3497.32 --> 3499.24]  We'll do more later in the room.
[3499.36 --> 3502.96]  I bet you some parents have some things they would wish they would never end either.
[3503.18 --> 3506.82]  Like, you know, like some dads maybe like fishing and they wish a fishing day would never end.
[3507.32 --> 3508.12]  Those kind of things.
[3508.54 --> 3509.22]  How about your mom?
[3509.30 --> 3512.88]  Has she ever gone for a massage and she comes home and says, oh, I wish that would never end?
[3513.14 --> 3513.42]  Yeah?
[3513.66 --> 3514.34]  Does that?
[3514.72 --> 3515.18]  Right on.
[3515.86 --> 3516.20]  Okay.
[3517.00 --> 3518.26]  Why don't you guys all stand up?
[3518.32 --> 3519.14]  We're going to do the blessing.
[3519.24 --> 3520.68]  If the congregation can join us.
[3520.68 --> 3521.68]  Okay.
[3521.68 --> 3525.20]  You guys ready?
[3525.94 --> 3528.42]  Lord be with you.
[3528.76 --> 3530.34]  And also with you.
[3530.34 --> 3555.12]  Good morning, church.
[3555.12 --> 3556.78]  I like that greeting.
[3556.92 --> 3558.12]  I think I'm going to keep using it.
[3558.44 --> 3559.00]  Thank you, Adam.
[3560.66 --> 3561.80]  My name is Dave.
[3561.90 --> 3563.82]  I'm one of the elders at this church.
[3564.34 --> 3567.28]  A few announcements before I begin our church family prayer.
[3567.92 --> 3569.94]  Thank you to everyone who came out to the AGM.

[3590.92 --> 3597.00]  God continues to bless our church family and we are grateful for everyone's participation in the life and the mission of Emmanuel.
[3598.66 --> 3602.14]  The formal sign-up for Mexico mission trip starts today.
[3602.14 --> 3609.40]  This is a trip that goes in March to Rosarito and Tijuana, Mexico to work with ministry partners there.
[3610.04 --> 3612.44]  Youth grade 10 and older are encouraged to sign up.
[3613.12 --> 3615.60]  Adults who want to sign up will not be turned away.
[3617.60 --> 3621.28]  Youth coffee is after church at Eric and Jackie Hubert's.
[3621.28 --> 3651.26]  Youth coffee is after church at Eric and Jackie Hubert's.
[3651.28 --> 3652.28]  Youth coffee is after church at Eric and Jackie Hubert's.
[3652.28 --> 3654.32]  Father, it is good for us to be here.
[3654.96 --> 3660.60]  We gather with the church here, with the church everywhere, to sing praises and to hear your word.
[3661.20 --> 3665.68]  We celebrate that the church's one foundation is Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[3667.04 --> 3669.58]  Father, we confess that we have sinned.
[3669.92 --> 3673.14]  We have fallen short of your glory and of Christ's example.
[3673.76 --> 3675.48]  We have sinned against each other.
[3676.02 --> 3677.24]  We have sinned against you.
[3677.24 --> 3683.50]  We confess that like our first parents in the garden, we have put our own selfish ambitions first
[3683.50 --> 3687.50]  at the expense of our relationship with the creation and our walk with you.
[3688.66 --> 3692.84]  Father, we thank you that we do not have to bear the burden of our sin and guilt,
[3693.24 --> 3698.74]  that you have sent your son to bear our sin, and that we don't have to bear it anymore.
[3698.74 --> 3707.78]  Father, it is good for us to gather on this first Sunday of Advent where we think the coming of Emmanuel, God with us.
[3708.50 --> 3715.00]  We think of the Old Testament people walking in darkness who have seen a great light.
[3715.64 --> 3720.56]  We hear the good news that to us a child is born and to us a son is given.
[3720.56 --> 3726.46]  We thank you for that great gift, for the great gift of your son, and we look to him.
[3726.98 --> 3735.18]  O come, O come, Emmanuel, and ransom captive Israel that mourns in lonely exile here until the son of God appear.
[3738.10 --> 3741.44]  Father, on this Sunday of Advent, we focus on the message of peace,
[3741.62 --> 3745.02]  and we look around the world around us and we see a great lack of it.
[3745.16 --> 3747.64]  We see a world that truly does need your peace.
[3747.64 --> 3753.82]  We think of the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas,
[3754.46 --> 3759.20]  and with all the difficulty and suffering that will happen in Israel and in Gaza because of it.
[3759.74 --> 3767.90]  We pray that these nations will find a way to coexist and to leave peacefully with each other
[3767.90 --> 3771.66]  and learn how to resolve their differences in an equitable manner.
[3772.06 --> 3777.62]  We think of the other war that we don't think about as often anymore because we're talking about another one.
[3777.64 --> 3782.72]  We think about the ongoing conflict in Ukraine with Russia with so many innocent victims there,
[3782.82 --> 3784.14]  and we don't see an end in sight.
[3784.68 --> 3787.70]  We know there's many places in the world that are experiencing conflict,
[3788.00 --> 3790.28]  and it's difficult to keep track of them all.
[3790.82 --> 3795.34]  And in this Christmas time, help us to remember all those who are suffering.
[3795.74 --> 3797.88]  We pray for your peace upon them all.
[3797.88 --> 3802.94]  Father, we thank you for the profession of faith that we can hear from Adam and Rachel,
[3803.50 --> 3809.12]  for the love that they could show for you and the commitment they have towards you and towards your church.
[3810.50 --> 3813.66]  Father, we think about the needs of this church community.
[3813.66 --> 3823.48]  We thank you for the life of Tini Vreend and the life that she could live.
[3824.04 --> 3830.84]  We pray for Brenda, for Linda, for Jodi, for all of the family who will be remembering her and grieving her passing.
[3830.84 --> 3833.76]  We pray that they will feel your love and your peace.
[3834.44 --> 3838.84]  We think about Alina Jepkema's brother Frank, who passed recently,
[3838.84 --> 3842.36]  and the service will be held in Ontario soon.
[3842.80 --> 3847.16]  We pray for that family as they go through a period of mourning and loss.
[3847.80 --> 3851.50]  We think about Rosvita's neighbor and friend Chandra, who passed away recently.
[3851.98 --> 3857.34]  We pray that you'll be with Rosvita and all family members who will be mourning that passing as well.
[3858.34 --> 3859.74]  Father, we think about this church.
[3860.06 --> 3861.96]  We have experienced a lot of funerals lately,
[3862.72 --> 3866.32]  and we know that for some people that in the midst of the joy of Christmas,
[3866.32 --> 3869.62]  that Christmas is often a time to mourn.
[3870.62 --> 3873.74]  We think about those who are experiencing illness and need your care.
[3874.28 --> 3878.76]  We think about Jerry Jansen's daughter Gonda, who will need that emergency surgery.
[3879.32 --> 3880.82]  We pray that this will go well,
[3880.82 --> 3885.96]  and we pray that people will come forward to take care of her husband while she's going through that.
[3886.48 --> 3890.80]  We think about Dennis Kalkman, who is in hospital getting treated for diabetes.
[3891.44 --> 3894.90]  We think about John Trass, who is getting some medical testing done.
[3894.90 --> 3899.70]  We think of Judy Verstig's daughter, Londa Cole, who is experiencing infection.
[3900.44 --> 3903.76]  We pray for Cy Visser, who is continuing to stay in the hospital.
[3904.68 --> 3911.32]  We think about Jaredina Jansen's granddaughter, Christina, who has been diagnosed with lupus.
[3911.88 --> 3915.46]  We think about all of those who are dealing with illness and uncertainty.
[3916.20 --> 3921.38]  We pray for those who will be giving them their medical care and meeting all of their needs.
[3921.38 --> 3925.20]  We pray that they will feel your comfort and your strength.
[3926.04 --> 3933.10]  Father, we pray for us as we carry on in this time of praise and of worship and of hearing your word.
[3933.94 --> 3937.44]  Come, thou long-expected Jesus, born to set thy people free.
[3937.94 --> 3939.96]  From our fears and sins release us.
[3940.10 --> 3941.50]  Let us find our rest in thee.
[3942.42 --> 3943.30]  Come, Lord Jesus.
[3944.10 --> 3944.40]  Amen.
[3944.40 --> 3944.50]  Amen.
[3944.50 --> 3944.60]  Amen.
[3951.38 --> 3951.70]  Amen.
[3952.90 --> 3954.00]  Thanks, David.
[3968.90 --> 3973.92]  As we've already indicated, this Advent and Christmas season,
[3973.92 --> 3981.60]  we are going to be looking at the traditional and liturgical words of the season.
[3981.60 --> 3989.06]  And in some ways, sort of contrasting what the culture and the world around us has on offer in that regard
[3989.06 --> 3994.22]  and what the Bible can really say in the truth of who Jesus is in that regard.
[3994.22 --> 3998.66]  And so each week, we're going to read a particular text,
[3998.82 --> 4005.82]  but really it's more of a survey of an idea as the Bible presents it to us.
[4006.10 --> 4011.36]  And so I'm going to read with you from Isaiah 9, verse 2 through 7.
[4011.50 --> 4013.40]  And so if you have a Bible, you can open that up.
[4013.44 --> 4014.12]  You can read along.
[4014.90 --> 4015.92]  It will be on the screen.
[4016.04 --> 4018.04]  But we'll be doing some moving and bouncing.
[4018.04 --> 4025.46]  And for the better part of that, that will be on the screen and will help us dig into this idea.
[4026.32 --> 4029.48]  So let's start together by reading from Isaiah 9.
[4033.06 --> 4036.32]  The people walking in darkness have seen a great light.
[4036.88 --> 4041.08]  On those living in the land of deep darkness, a light has dawned.
[4041.90 --> 4044.82]  You have enlarged the nation and increased their joy.
[4044.82 --> 4052.22]  They rejoice before you as people rejoice at the harvest, as warriors rejoice when dividing the plunder.
[4053.34 --> 4057.96]  For as in the day of Midian's defeat, you have shattered the yoke that burdens them,
[4058.30 --> 4061.54]  the bar across their shoulders, the rod of their oppressor.
[4062.44 --> 4067.96]  Every warrior's boot used in battle and every garment rolled in blood will be destined for burning,
[4068.34 --> 4069.74]  will be fuel for the fire.
[4069.74 --> 4077.06]  For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders,
[4077.06 --> 4083.68]  and he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
[4084.46 --> 4089.38]  Of the greatness of his government and peace, there will be no end.
[4090.28 --> 4093.94]  He will reign on David's throne and over his kingdom,
[4093.94 --> 4101.18]  establishing it and upholding it with justice and righteousness from that time on and forever.
[4101.78 --> 4105.68]  The zeal of the Lord Almighty will accomplish this.
[4106.20 --> 4107.32]  This is the word of the Lord.
[4107.32 --> 4117.42]  So I don't know if you've noticed, but it's that time of year again.
[4118.84 --> 4126.24]  In fact, as soon as Remembrance Day passed, for some of us as soon as Thanksgiving passed,
[4126.64 --> 4130.54]  we noticed pretty quickly it's that time of year again,
[4130.54 --> 4139.70]  as radio stations and stores and places immediately shift into full-on Christmas propaganda mode.
[4140.70 --> 4147.16]  At least that's what it feels like to some of us who have a rule that you have to wait for Advent
[4147.16 --> 4150.96]  in order for Christmas and that season to properly start.
[4151.32 --> 4156.00]  Now we have that rule not for fancy liturgical reasons like you might suspect of a pastor,
[4156.00 --> 4161.96]  but because my daughter's birthday is November 27, and she says no Christmas before her birthday.
[4162.98 --> 4165.38]  And so it usually falls then to Advent.
[4165.92 --> 4169.06]  Although I'm going to be honest with you, Rachel found a loophole this year,
[4169.14 --> 4171.86]  and I can tell you because Nora's in the nursery and she's not here,
[4172.30 --> 4175.90]  Rachel has said this is winter decoration, not Christmas decoration.
[4179.58 --> 4182.54]  But it is that time of year again.
[4182.54 --> 4197.68]  And as we enter into this season, it always strikes me the attempt that our culture makes
[4197.68 --> 4207.76]  to offer something meaningful and veiled in a nebulous sort of spiritual language.
[4207.76 --> 4215.78]  And even more so, when I was really young, there was the whole debate about Christmas or X-mas
[4215.78 --> 4217.46]  and keeping Christ in Christmas.
[4217.72 --> 4223.58]  What people didn't realize, of course, is that X is the Greek letter key, which is the symbol for Christ.
[4223.74 --> 4226.10]  And so even X-mas is keeping Christ in Christmas.
[4226.32 --> 4230.54]  But that debate doesn't exist anymore because people aren't concerned with a, quote,
[4230.70 --> 4235.74]  secular Christmas so much as they are a spiritual Christmas.
[4235.74 --> 4238.20]  But what on earth does that even mean?
[4240.12 --> 4246.26]  What I hope that we're going to see as we dig into these themes of Advent of peace, hope, joy, and love,
[4246.66 --> 4253.94]  that what the world has on offer for us pales in comparison
[4253.94 --> 4262.54]  to what God brings in the coming of Jesus, in Emmanuel, in Christmas season together.
[4262.54 --> 4268.90]  Now, this text from Isaiah 9 is probably very familiar to many of you.
[4269.76 --> 4276.22]  I can't read this text and a bunch of others without hearing Handel's Messiah coursing through my brain
[4276.22 --> 4277.86]  as we read them.
[4278.58 --> 4282.76]  It's a regular part of the rhythms and liturgy of Advent.
[4282.76 --> 4292.76]  Now, really quickly, let me just map it out for you so that we can dig into this idea of peace on offer.
[4294.00 --> 4301.04]  Isaiah begins in a place of remembering the darkness that once was,
[4301.44 --> 4303.24]  the place where the people were,
[4303.68 --> 4309.38]  the distance from God that they had experienced in the wilderness and in conflict.
[4309.38 --> 4314.80]  But now, these people walking in darkness have seen a great light.
[4314.92 --> 4317.74]  That is, God is doing something among them.
[4318.92 --> 4322.30]  And these people have grown in response to God's work,
[4322.42 --> 4326.12]  and they've been blessed in response to God being among them.
[4326.46 --> 4330.58]  Their nation has grown, and their joy with that has grown.
[4330.58 --> 4337.56]  Isaiah recalls the defeats of enemies to the point where, in verse 5, he says,
[4338.26 --> 4344.72]  every warrior's boot used in battle, every garment rolled in blood will be destined for burning,
[4345.32 --> 4346.96]  will be fuel for the fire.
[4348.02 --> 4351.68]  And what he means there is that there's no more need for it.
[4352.46 --> 4355.86]  It's fuel for the fire because we don't need warrior's clothes anymore.
[4356.32 --> 4358.54]  This is a new era, a new time.
[4358.54 --> 4366.78]  Now, this new era and this new time in history is marked, Isaiah says, by a son.
[4367.74 --> 4369.50]  For to us, a child is born.
[4369.62 --> 4371.62]  To us, a son is given.
[4372.38 --> 4374.62]  And this isn't just any son.
[4375.18 --> 4376.90]  The government will be on his shoulders,
[4377.04 --> 4384.92]  and he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
[4384.92 --> 4393.66]  Now, for our time together this morning, it's that last title that I want us to key in on, right?
[4393.80 --> 4395.30]  Prince of Peace.
[4395.68 --> 4399.92]  What does it mean that this son is called the Prince of Peace?
[4400.62 --> 4405.32]  What does it mean that this child to be born, or of this child to be born,
[4405.32 --> 4411.28]  it is said, of his greatness and government and peace there will be no end?
[4411.28 --> 4420.04]  So, when the Bible talks about peace, and when the Bible talks about this promised son,
[4420.44 --> 4425.30]  who we believe to be Jesus, born at Christmas, being the Prince of Peace,
[4425.44 --> 4428.58]  what does that mean for us today?
[4429.22 --> 4434.20]  What does that mean for people who profess to be Jesus' disciples in the 21st century?
[4434.20 --> 4438.20]  What is this peace, and how do we get it?
[4439.94 --> 4446.36]  The theme this morning, the big idea for us is to see, Lord willing,
[4446.50 --> 4449.76]  that biblical peace, that peace in the Bible,
[4450.16 --> 4456.18]  is not the absence or the end of conflict, though it might include that,
[4456.18 --> 4465.08]  but a restoration to wholeness that you carry into every brokenness.
[4466.42 --> 4469.58]  Peace in the Bible doesn't mean the absence or the end of conflict,
[4469.82 --> 4473.64]  but it means being restored to wholeness.
[4474.70 --> 4480.60]  In the Bible, peace is about so much more than a state of being without war.
[4481.40 --> 4484.48]  Peace, or the Hebrew word, shalom, right?
[4484.48 --> 4488.40]  If you were here for the video at the beginning, is about wholeness.
[4488.44 --> 4492.76]  If we extrapolate out from that, it's about being fully human, fully alive.
[4494.46 --> 4501.46]  Peace, in short, is union with God and communion with people and creation.
[4503.00 --> 4507.06]  Peace is the fullness of life and ultimate satisfaction.
[4507.66 --> 4510.98]  Peace is drinking deeply of the living water,
[4510.98 --> 4515.08]  after which Jesus promises you will never thirst again.
[4516.36 --> 4522.76]  This Advent and Christmas, we're going to look at the way that the Bible shows and reveals
[4522.76 --> 4527.60]  and changes our ideas of peace and hope and joy and love.
[4527.76 --> 4535.20]  And our task as preachers in this, because myself and Kevin and Josh will all be part of this for us,
[4535.20 --> 4542.90]  is to paint a picture, hopefully, that you see something beautiful in each of these themes.
[4543.96 --> 4549.64]  This Christmas, we're being invited into a deeper experience than what the world has to offer.
[4550.34 --> 4555.76]  This Christmas, you are invited into something more.
[4557.14 --> 4559.98]  C.S. Lewis talked about the deeper magic.
[4559.98 --> 4589.96]  C.S. Lewis talked about the fact that the Bible says,
[4589.96 --> 4592.70]  And in that moment, and in that moment of pause,
[4594.22 --> 4598.82]  if you will let it be spiritual food for you to sustain you,
[4599.68 --> 4605.20]  you can experience this peace in the midst of all of that busyness,
[4605.66 --> 4607.26]  and in the midst of all that chaos.
[4608.94 --> 4614.50]  We've heard already from our liturgy this morning that Advent is a season of waiting.
[4615.32 --> 4619.20]  Waiting as the darkness is slowly pushed back more and more.
[4619.20 --> 4624.00]  Each week, we wait for the light of the world to come.
[4625.50 --> 4633.28]  And the what for of our waiting is directly related to the how to of our waiting.
[4633.28 --> 4641.14]  And so, we wait for peace by living peace, by living shalom.
[4641.64 --> 4647.00]  We wait for hope fulfilled by choosing to be hopeful.
[4647.86 --> 4653.72]  We wait for eternal joy by finding joy in the moment in God.
[4653.72 --> 4654.64]  Right?
[4654.70 --> 4660.30]  We wait for love's culmination by living love to others.
[4660.30 --> 4668.66]  Now, you've already heard me say that in our world,
[4669.60 --> 4674.02]  and in our sort of modern therapeutic culture,
[4674.88 --> 4681.66]  the peace that we are invited to experience usually means one of three things.
[4681.66 --> 4686.78]  And I encourage you to think about how your experience or your witnessing of peace
[4686.78 --> 4691.30]  relates to one of these three ways of experiencing it.
[4691.68 --> 4698.78]  In the first place, peace means, obviously, a state of not war or a state of not being in conflict.
[4699.68 --> 4702.44]  But that doesn't have to be a military conflict.
[4702.66 --> 4705.32]  That can also be a relational peace.
[4705.96 --> 4706.20]  Right?
[4706.20 --> 4710.68]  We want to keep the peace in our families because life is better that way.
[4711.76 --> 4714.04]  Maybe not better, but a little bit easier.
[4714.66 --> 4717.80]  Well, maybe not easier, but easier to ignore.
[4718.74 --> 4721.98]  You see how that slowly begins to happen when we get clarity?
[4723.34 --> 4729.24]  Another way that we talk about peace is the opposite of inner turmoil.
[4730.20 --> 4730.42]  Right?
[4730.42 --> 4735.92]  We talk about being at peace in ourselves or in our hearts or in our minds
[4735.92 --> 4742.14]  when there's no divergent or disagreeing opinions or thoughts.
[4742.98 --> 4743.64]  Right?
[4743.68 --> 4747.00]  We feel a sense of peace, or we can feel a sense of peace,
[4747.34 --> 4751.38]  when those things are settled, when they're equal.
[4751.96 --> 4753.82]  And it's when they make sense,
[4754.60 --> 4757.82]  and then the feelings we have about those things
[4757.82 --> 4761.46]  match the reality we are experiencing about those things,
[4761.46 --> 4766.28]  and then, which then matches the reality we live out of in those things,
[4766.34 --> 4768.34]  in the world, that we can have peace.
[4769.68 --> 4776.72]  In this way, we talk about peace as the opposite of inner turmoil or conflict,
[4777.34 --> 4786.36]  and in this way, this idea of peace is the expressed reality of personhood,
[4786.88 --> 4788.84]  unique and independent.
[4788.84 --> 4792.14]  Now, again, these things aren't wrong,
[4792.36 --> 4794.58]  but if you have the eyes to see,
[4794.70 --> 4797.08]  you can begin to see how that also gets warped
[4797.08 --> 4802.64]  into a strange and other definition of peace.
[4803.60 --> 4806.94]  The third way that people talk about peace in our culture
[4806.94 --> 4809.98]  continues in this inner reality of being at peace,
[4809.98 --> 4811.98]  but it's sometimes called inner peace.
[4813.28 --> 4814.98]  This is sometimes talked about,
[4815.04 --> 4819.82]  this idea of enlightenment or the achievement of zen or calm.
[4820.90 --> 4821.00]  Right?
[4822.00 --> 4828.74]  And this idea is really about being unbothered by the world around you.
[4829.84 --> 4833.74]  And this is where inner peace becomes lived out in the world,
[4833.74 --> 4836.64]  and other people can't touch your peace.
[4836.74 --> 4838.18]  They can't bother your peace.
[4839.28 --> 4843.22]  Now, again, it's not to say that this is wrong,
[4843.48 --> 4845.48]  but it's ultimately insufficient.
[4846.96 --> 4849.06]  And now, sometimes, the way that this gets manifested
[4849.06 --> 4853.44]  is tied to ideas of personal sort of prosperity.
[4854.10 --> 4854.22]  Right?
[4854.22 --> 4855.86]  We think something like, you know,
[4855.88 --> 4858.72]  if I just had that money, or if I just had that job,
[4858.98 --> 4861.00]  right, then I would finally be at peace.
[4861.38 --> 4862.78]  Then I wouldn't have to worry.
[4863.94 --> 4864.16]  Right?
[4864.20 --> 4865.96]  And peace is contrasted with worry,
[4866.16 --> 4869.74]  and it's contrasted with security in that way.
[4871.58 --> 4874.14]  And in all three of these other ways,
[4874.54 --> 4876.24]  in our world today,
[4876.30 --> 4878.34]  there's all sorts of, like, gurus
[4878.34 --> 4881.28]  and internet influencers and teachers
[4881.28 --> 4884.22]  who can help you try to find that kind of peace.
[4885.98 --> 4887.44]  The problem is,
[4887.88 --> 4889.68]  it doesn't last.
[4891.66 --> 4893.88]  And let's be honest,
[4894.66 --> 4897.86]  those gurus and internet influencers and teachers
[4897.86 --> 4900.56]  who make their careers off of providing
[4900.56 --> 4902.58]  and teaching people to find that kind of peace,
[4902.96 --> 4904.56]  they don't want it to last.
[4905.88 --> 4908.22]  Because then they would be working themselves out of a job.
[4908.22 --> 4911.68]  Now, I'm mindful that some of you,
[4912.00 --> 4914.38]  maybe the more cynical among you here this morning,
[4914.82 --> 4915.92]  are saying to yourself,
[4916.20 --> 4918.46]  hey, pastor, isn't that exactly what you do?
[4920.30 --> 4922.28]  Don't you teach us to find peace,
[4922.44 --> 4924.64]  and don't you want us to not have peace,
[4924.66 --> 4926.58]  because then you would be working yourself out of your job?
[4926.72 --> 4927.58]  And I want to say, yeah.
[4928.18 --> 4928.66]  You know what?
[4928.72 --> 4930.78]  I want to work myself out of a job.
[4932.06 --> 4932.26]  Right?
[4932.28 --> 4933.64]  If I work myself out of a job,
[4933.76 --> 4935.10]  that means only one thing.
[4935.10 --> 4937.04]  That means the Lord Jesus Christ has returned,
[4937.04 --> 4939.68]  and we've prayed maranatha,
[4939.82 --> 4940.64]  and it's been fulfilled,
[4940.88 --> 4942.44]  and I'm okay with that.
[4946.52 --> 4947.78]  Instead, though,
[4948.62 --> 4951.18]  what I hope that we can begin to see,
[4951.32 --> 4952.94]  and what I want to do is paint for you
[4952.94 --> 4956.84]  a word picture about peace in the Bible.
[4957.46 --> 4958.98]  Because here's the thing,
[4959.04 --> 4960.48]  I genuinely believe
[4960.48 --> 4963.82]  that it is only the peace that the Bible talks about,
[4963.82 --> 4966.16]  only the peace that God has on offer,
[4966.16 --> 4968.70]  only the peace that is ultimately expressed,
[4968.88 --> 4970.00]  and fulfilled, and contained,
[4970.16 --> 4973.06]  and given to us in the person of Jesus Christ,
[4973.14 --> 4975.30]  that can provide the sort of lasting,
[4975.94 --> 4979.68]  living peace that we are hungry for.
[4980.72 --> 4980.88]  Right?
[4980.94 --> 4983.20]  What the world offers as peace
[4983.20 --> 4986.56]  is only a fading shadow of the real thing,
[4986.80 --> 4988.10]  and I hope and I pray
[4988.10 --> 4990.20]  that you begin to experience that,
[4990.26 --> 4992.42]  that you begin to taste and see
[4992.42 --> 4994.80]  the truth of that this morning.
[4996.20 --> 4998.52]  And so this really begins
[4998.52 --> 5001.80]  all the way back in Genesis.
[5002.40 --> 5004.40]  In Genesis 1 and 2,
[5004.62 --> 5008.20]  we really start this idea off.
[5009.20 --> 5012.02]  That God has created the world
[5012.02 --> 5013.10]  and everything in it.
[5013.20 --> 5015.06]  He has created and commissioned
[5015.06 --> 5016.22]  Adam and Eve
[5016.22 --> 5018.58]  to oversee His creation,
[5018.58 --> 5020.80]  and to join Him
[5020.80 --> 5023.06]  in the continued creation,
[5023.26 --> 5024.98]  the continued co-creation
[5024.98 --> 5026.34]  of the world
[5026.34 --> 5027.46]  out of the materials
[5027.46 --> 5028.26]  that He has made.
[5029.20 --> 5031.12]  And as you read that part of the story,
[5031.34 --> 5032.26]  God appears
[5032.26 --> 5034.60]  as though He is regularly with them
[5034.60 --> 5035.20]  and in their midst.
[5035.30 --> 5036.96]  He's walking through the garden
[5036.96 --> 5037.84]  looking for them
[5037.84 --> 5039.60]  and communing with them.
[5040.26 --> 5040.48]  All right?
[5040.52 --> 5041.84]  The animals are at peace
[5041.84 --> 5043.40]  and living into their purpose.
[5043.52 --> 5044.48]  The man and the woman
[5044.48 --> 5045.32]  are at peace
[5045.32 --> 5047.54]  and living into their purposes.
[5047.84 --> 5049.10]  Their relationship together
[5049.10 --> 5050.18]  is complementary
[5050.18 --> 5052.14]  and it is very good.
[5052.52 --> 5054.64]  And their labors go well for them.
[5055.58 --> 5057.22]  Everything is right
[5057.22 --> 5058.10]  in that picture
[5058.10 --> 5059.64]  because their relationship
[5059.64 --> 5061.46]  to God is right.
[5061.60 --> 5062.58]  And when their relationship
[5062.58 --> 5063.58]  to God is right,
[5063.68 --> 5064.18]  their relationship
[5064.18 --> 5065.56]  to each other is right.
[5065.60 --> 5066.20]  And their relationship
[5066.20 --> 5067.64]  to the creation around them
[5067.64 --> 5068.42]  is right.
[5069.98 --> 5072.50]  But when they disobey God,
[5072.50 --> 5074.30]  they're rebelling against
[5074.30 --> 5075.54]  His perfect order
[5075.54 --> 5076.50]  and this harmony,
[5077.10 --> 5079.08]  this communion with God
[5079.08 --> 5080.96]  and this union with God
[5080.96 --> 5083.08]  and communion with human together
[5083.08 --> 5085.14]  has broken.
[5085.60 --> 5087.88]  What was in a state of wholeness,
[5088.12 --> 5089.10]  of completeness,
[5089.22 --> 5090.20]  of shalom,
[5091.04 --> 5091.86]  is shattered.
[5093.14 --> 5094.62]  They reject His shalom.
[5095.60 --> 5097.02]  And you can see its effects
[5097.02 --> 5098.68]  immediately in the story.
[5098.80 --> 5099.66]  Shalom is broken
[5099.66 --> 5101.18]  and so things are out of order.
[5101.54 --> 5102.28]  They're off kilter.
[5102.28 --> 5103.04]  They're not the way
[5103.04 --> 5104.00]  they're supposed to be.
[5104.36 --> 5105.66]  And so now the world,
[5105.82 --> 5106.48]  that is the plants
[5106.48 --> 5107.12]  and the animals
[5107.12 --> 5108.12]  and nature alike
[5108.12 --> 5109.04]  and humanity
[5109.04 --> 5110.58]  are at odds together.
[5111.28 --> 5112.10]  And God,
[5112.24 --> 5113.20]  who is the creator
[5113.20 --> 5114.30]  of all life,
[5114.54 --> 5115.42]  says to the woman
[5115.42 --> 5116.94]  who is a co-creator
[5116.94 --> 5118.22]  of life within her
[5118.22 --> 5120.40]  that her creating life
[5120.40 --> 5121.34]  will now be painful
[5121.34 --> 5122.28]  and severe.
[5123.34 --> 5123.88]  God,
[5123.98 --> 5125.52]  who produced everything
[5125.52 --> 5126.94]  that is out of nothing
[5126.94 --> 5128.58]  and has given the man
[5128.58 --> 5129.86]  a job to produce
[5129.86 --> 5131.08]  out of the ground,
[5131.08 --> 5132.42]  says that his labor
[5132.42 --> 5133.50]  will now be hard
[5133.50 --> 5134.72]  and will be painful
[5134.72 --> 5136.40]  and he will toil at it.
[5137.48 --> 5138.50]  And what was supposed
[5138.50 --> 5139.66]  to be a joyful
[5139.66 --> 5140.84]  coexisting
[5140.84 --> 5142.26]  of their life together
[5142.26 --> 5143.44]  now is turning
[5143.44 --> 5145.52]  into a wrestled labor
[5145.52 --> 5146.98]  of submission
[5146.98 --> 5148.52]  and abuse.
[5149.40 --> 5150.52]  The relationship
[5150.52 --> 5151.26]  of the man
[5151.26 --> 5151.72]  and the woman
[5151.72 --> 5152.56]  which was intended
[5152.56 --> 5154.26]  to model God's relationship
[5154.26 --> 5155.04]  to humanity
[5155.04 --> 5156.44]  will be strained
[5156.44 --> 5157.62]  and broken.
[5157.62 --> 5160.18]  And this communion
[5160.18 --> 5160.86]  of God
[5160.86 --> 5161.54]  with humanity
[5161.54 --> 5162.44]  which was supposed
[5162.44 --> 5163.40]  to be eternal
[5163.40 --> 5165.24]  now ends
[5165.24 --> 5166.26]  in death.
[5167.54 --> 5168.30]  In Genesis 3
[5168.30 --> 5169.68]  you read,
[5169.88 --> 5171.00]  for dust you are
[5171.00 --> 5172.34]  and into dust
[5172.34 --> 5173.62]  you will return.
[5173.90 --> 5174.44]  Shalom
[5174.44 --> 5176.66]  is broken.
[5176.92 --> 5178.02]  That's what sin
[5178.02 --> 5178.88]  does.
[5179.76 --> 5180.58]  In fact,
[5180.72 --> 5181.26]  theologian
[5181.26 --> 5182.36]  Cornelius Plantinga
[5182.36 --> 5183.08]  in his,
[5183.22 --> 5183.94]  what I think is
[5183.94 --> 5184.76]  an amazing book,
[5184.96 --> 5186.08]  a breviary of sin,
[5186.08 --> 5188.40]  he defines sin
[5188.40 --> 5189.98]  as culpable
[5189.98 --> 5191.70]  shalom breaking.
[5193.76 --> 5195.80]  Sin isn't just sinning.
[5196.48 --> 5197.42]  Hear what I'm saying, right?
[5197.68 --> 5198.70]  Sin isn't just
[5198.70 --> 5199.94]  the things that you do
[5199.94 --> 5201.66]  but it's part of
[5201.66 --> 5202.30]  the reality
[5202.30 --> 5203.14]  that we live in
[5203.14 --> 5204.26]  of broken shalom.
[5205.20 --> 5205.96]  Because of our
[5205.96 --> 5207.36]  broken union with God
[5207.36 --> 5208.10]  our communion
[5208.10 --> 5208.94]  with each other
[5208.94 --> 5209.84]  and with the world
[5209.84 --> 5210.88]  is also broken.
[5212.26 --> 5213.68]  That's why we need shalom.
[5214.68 --> 5215.26]  That's why we need
[5215.26 --> 5216.94]  God's shalom.
[5217.62 --> 5219.00]  Shalom is union
[5219.00 --> 5219.70]  with God
[5219.70 --> 5220.38]  and communion
[5220.38 --> 5221.00]  with each other.
[5221.26 --> 5222.16]  It's talking about
[5222.16 --> 5223.26]  the way things
[5223.26 --> 5224.00]  were always
[5224.00 --> 5225.18]  supposed to be.
[5226.36 --> 5227.36]  Shalom is this
[5227.36 --> 5228.42]  sense of wholeness
[5228.42 --> 5229.50]  and completeness
[5229.50 --> 5230.54]  that you were created
[5230.54 --> 5230.98]  for
[5230.98 --> 5232.36]  and that God
[5232.36 --> 5233.74]  wants to restore
[5233.74 --> 5234.32]  us to.
[5235.20 --> 5236.28]  And that kind
[5236.28 --> 5236.94]  of shalom
[5236.94 --> 5238.38]  is what God
[5238.38 --> 5239.56]  is offering to us
[5239.56 --> 5240.32]  this Christmas.
[5240.46 --> 5241.48]  That kind of shalom
[5241.48 --> 5242.54]  is what is offered
[5242.54 --> 5243.06]  to us
[5243.06 --> 5244.36]  in Emmanuel
[5244.36 --> 5245.76]  God with us.
[5248.32 --> 5249.74]  Now in the story
[5249.74 --> 5251.12]  as it works itself out
[5251.12 --> 5252.72]  God's people
[5252.72 --> 5253.42]  are supposed
[5253.42 --> 5254.62]  to be defined
[5254.62 --> 5256.12]  by this sense
[5256.12 --> 5256.70]  of life
[5256.70 --> 5257.62]  and they strive
[5257.62 --> 5258.98]  towards living
[5258.98 --> 5259.74]  into this
[5259.74 --> 5261.40]  sense of shalom
[5261.40 --> 5262.76]  and out of this
[5262.76 --> 5263.72]  shalom
[5263.72 --> 5264.80]  as they are
[5264.80 --> 5266.14]  striving in
[5266.14 --> 5267.26]  relationship with God.
[5267.26 --> 5270.38]  part of the way
[5270.38 --> 5270.88]  that God
[5270.88 --> 5272.44]  defines his people
[5272.44 --> 5273.64]  is the blessing
[5273.64 --> 5274.52]  he gives them.
[5275.30 --> 5275.66]  And so in
[5275.66 --> 5276.40]  Numbers 6
[5276.40 --> 5277.94]  verse 24
[5277.94 --> 5279.38]  through 27
[5279.38 --> 5280.92]  we read
[5280.92 --> 5281.84]  what's there
[5281.84 --> 5282.52]  referred to
[5282.52 --> 5283.52]  as the Aaronic
[5283.52 --> 5283.92]  blessing.
[5284.10 --> 5284.74]  It's the blessing
[5284.74 --> 5285.50]  that Aaron would
[5285.50 --> 5286.68]  speak over the
[5286.68 --> 5287.54]  people of Israel.
[5287.98 --> 5288.92]  Sometimes we hear it
[5288.92 --> 5289.54]  at the end of our
[5289.54 --> 5290.40]  worship together.
[5290.84 --> 5291.26]  It says,
[5291.40 --> 5292.32]  the Lord bless you
[5292.32 --> 5293.34]  and keep you.
[5293.52 --> 5294.74]  The Lord make his face
[5294.74 --> 5295.58]  shine upon you
[5295.58 --> 5296.82]  and be gracious to you.
[5296.82 --> 5298.72]  the Lord turn his face
[5298.72 --> 5299.54]  towards you
[5299.54 --> 5301.00]  and give you
[5301.00 --> 5302.08]  peace.
[5303.92 --> 5305.18]  God wants
[5305.18 --> 5306.04]  these people
[5306.04 --> 5307.28]  to have his peace
[5307.28 --> 5308.44]  but even more than that
[5308.44 --> 5309.30]  the next line
[5309.30 --> 5311.68]  so they will put
[5311.68 --> 5312.60]  my name
[5312.60 --> 5313.60]  on the Israelites
[5313.60 --> 5314.52]  and I
[5314.52 --> 5315.66]  will bless them.
[5318.04 --> 5319.32]  God is saying
[5319.32 --> 5320.50]  when you enter
[5320.50 --> 5321.72]  into relationship
[5321.72 --> 5322.58]  with me
[5322.58 --> 5323.50]  when my name
[5323.50 --> 5324.44]  is on you
[5324.44 --> 5325.72]  and you are blessed
[5325.72 --> 5327.38]  you will know
[5327.38 --> 5328.06]  this
[5328.06 --> 5329.24]  peace.
[5331.24 --> 5331.64]  Now
[5331.64 --> 5332.78]  we're not going to
[5332.78 --> 5333.10]  go through
[5333.10 --> 5333.86]  every instance
[5333.86 --> 5335.26]  in the word
[5335.26 --> 5336.32]  peace being used
[5336.32 --> 5336.88]  in the Bible
[5336.88 --> 5337.52]  but let me just
[5337.52 --> 5339.02]  do a super quick
[5339.02 --> 5339.78]  and ultimately
[5339.78 --> 5340.94]  insufficient survey
[5340.94 --> 5342.22]  but maybe it stirs
[5342.22 --> 5342.78]  something in you
[5342.78 --> 5343.34]  to do a little bit
[5343.34 --> 5343.70]  of study
[5343.70 --> 5344.60]  this week
[5344.60 --> 5346.10]  because the rest
[5346.10 --> 5347.66]  of this story
[5347.66 --> 5349.22]  or a bunch
[5349.22 --> 5350.02]  of the next part
[5350.02 --> 5350.38]  anyway
[5350.38 --> 5351.30]  of this story
[5351.30 --> 5352.94]  is how these people
[5352.94 --> 5354.10]  reject the peace
[5354.10 --> 5354.64]  that was offered
[5354.64 --> 5355.00]  to them
[5355.00 --> 5356.34]  how they
[5356.34 --> 5358.62]  reject the wholeness
[5358.62 --> 5359.36]  that was intended
[5359.36 --> 5359.96]  for them
[5359.96 --> 5361.22]  and there are
[5361.22 --> 5362.36]  constantly glimpses
[5362.36 --> 5363.40]  of it in their life
[5363.40 --> 5364.34]  and prophets
[5364.34 --> 5365.20]  like Isaiah
[5365.20 --> 5366.10]  who we read already
[5366.10 --> 5366.86]  are constantly
[5366.86 --> 5368.04]  painting a picture
[5368.04 --> 5368.80]  and holding it
[5368.80 --> 5369.48]  before them
[5369.48 --> 5370.30]  right
[5370.30 --> 5371.02]  so not only
[5371.02 --> 5372.08]  in Isaiah 9
[5372.08 --> 5373.34]  but all throughout
[5373.34 --> 5374.18]  Isaiah 40
[5374.18 --> 5375.12]  right
[5375.12 --> 5376.00]  Isaiah 53
[5376.00 --> 5377.00]  these beautiful pictures
[5377.00 --> 5377.74]  of how this peace
[5377.74 --> 5378.84]  will be accomplished
[5378.84 --> 5380.12]  but another one
[5380.12 --> 5382.36]  the prophet Nahum
[5382.36 --> 5383.34]  he says
[5383.34 --> 5383.92]  look there
[5383.92 --> 5384.58]  on the mountains
[5384.58 --> 5385.10]  the feet
[5385.10 --> 5385.62]  of the one
[5385.62 --> 5386.88]  who bring good news
[5386.88 --> 5389.04]  who proclaims peace
[5389.04 --> 5390.02]  right
[5390.02 --> 5391.18]  there's a looking forward
[5391.18 --> 5392.24]  to this sense
[5392.24 --> 5393.20]  of peace
[5393.20 --> 5394.52]  but all of it
[5394.52 --> 5395.28]  what we have begun
[5395.28 --> 5396.00]  to see
[5396.00 --> 5396.90]  all of it
[5396.90 --> 5397.50]  was pointing
[5397.50 --> 5398.30]  to something
[5398.30 --> 5399.62]  or someone
[5399.62 --> 5400.82]  greater
[5400.82 --> 5402.20]  remember what Isaiah
[5402.20 --> 5402.60]  said
[5402.60 --> 5403.82]  for to us
[5403.82 --> 5404.46]  a child
[5404.46 --> 5405.40]  is born
[5405.40 --> 5406.34]  to us
[5406.34 --> 5406.94]  a son
[5406.94 --> 5408.04]  is given
[5408.04 --> 5409.86]  right
[5409.86 --> 5410.42]  when Jesus
[5410.42 --> 5411.20]  was born
[5411.20 --> 5412.38]  what did the angels
[5412.38 --> 5412.76]  sing
[5412.76 --> 5413.48]  in Luke 2
[5413.48 --> 5413.96]  14
[5413.96 --> 5415.94]  glory to God
[5415.94 --> 5416.54]  in the highest
[5416.54 --> 5417.44]  and on earth
[5417.44 --> 5418.96]  peace
[5418.96 --> 5420.20]  to those
[5420.20 --> 5420.54]  on whom
[5420.54 --> 5421.02]  his favor
[5421.02 --> 5421.54]  rests
[5421.54 --> 5422.96]  when Jesus
[5422.96 --> 5423.94]  entered Jerusalem
[5423.94 --> 5424.94]  some 33 years
[5424.94 --> 5425.20]  later
[5425.20 --> 5425.94]  the people
[5425.94 --> 5426.60]  cried out
[5426.60 --> 5427.48]  in Luke 19
[5427.48 --> 5428.00]  37
[5428.00 --> 5429.66]  when he came
[5429.66 --> 5430.02]  near
[5430.02 --> 5430.60]  the place
[5430.60 --> 5431.18]  where the road
[5431.18 --> 5431.68]  goes down
[5431.68 --> 5431.98]  the Mount
[5431.98 --> 5432.42]  of Olives
[5432.42 --> 5433.14]  the whole crowd
[5433.14 --> 5433.74]  of disciples
[5433.74 --> 5434.78]  began joyfully
[5434.78 --> 5435.62]  to praise God
[5435.62 --> 5436.38]  and loud voices
[5436.38 --> 5436.98]  for the miracles
[5436.98 --> 5437.60]  they had seen
[5437.60 --> 5438.58]  and they said
[5438.58 --> 5439.86]  blessed is the king
[5439.86 --> 5441.02]  remember the government
[5441.02 --> 5441.88]  will be on his shoulders
[5441.88 --> 5442.80]  blessed is the king
[5442.80 --> 5443.80]  who comes in the name
[5443.80 --> 5444.32]  of the Lord
[5444.32 --> 5445.94]  peace in heaven
[5445.94 --> 5447.02]  and glory
[5447.02 --> 5448.42]  in the highest
[5448.42 --> 5450.00]  the peace
[5450.00 --> 5450.62]  that is offered
[5450.62 --> 5451.26]  to us
[5451.26 --> 5451.74]  comes
[5451.74 --> 5452.96]  in the person
[5452.96 --> 5454.10]  of Jesus
[5454.10 --> 5454.84]  that's what
[5454.84 --> 5455.56]  Christmas
[5455.56 --> 5456.44]  is about
[5456.44 --> 5456.88]  that's why
[5456.88 --> 5457.42]  the angels
[5457.42 --> 5458.16]  sang
[5458.16 --> 5459.12]  Jesus himself
[5459.12 --> 5460.04]  says this
[5460.04 --> 5461.30]  in John 14
[5461.30 --> 5461.72]  27
[5461.72 --> 5462.14]  he says
[5462.14 --> 5463.38]  peace I leave
[5463.38 --> 5464.30]  with you
[5464.30 --> 5465.18]  my peace
[5465.18 --> 5466.32]  I give you
[5466.32 --> 5467.94]  in John 16
[5467.94 --> 5468.86]  Jesus says
[5468.86 --> 5469.66]  I have told you
[5469.66 --> 5470.44]  these things
[5470.44 --> 5471.34]  so that you
[5471.34 --> 5472.12]  may have
[5472.12 --> 5473.02]  peace
[5473.02 --> 5474.50]  in this world
[5474.50 --> 5475.10]  you will have
[5475.10 --> 5475.46]  trouble
[5475.46 --> 5477.44]  but take heart
[5477.44 --> 5479.00]  I have overcome
[5479.00 --> 5479.80]  the world
[5479.80 --> 5482.84]  Jesus comes
[5482.84 --> 5484.34]  to bring us
[5484.34 --> 5484.86]  peace
[5484.86 --> 5485.96]  and he comes
[5485.96 --> 5486.56]  not only to
[5486.56 --> 5487.24]  bring us
[5487.24 --> 5487.64]  peace
[5487.64 --> 5488.38]  but he comes
[5488.38 --> 5490.10]  as our
[5490.10 --> 5491.08]  peace
[5491.08 --> 5492.98]  Ephesians 2
[5492.98 --> 5494.96]  verse 13
[5494.96 --> 5496.38]  we can read
[5496.38 --> 5496.78]  together
[5496.78 --> 5497.72]  but now
[5497.72 --> 5498.48]  in Christ
[5498.48 --> 5499.00]  Jesus
[5499.00 --> 5499.70]  you who
[5499.70 --> 5500.14]  were once
[5500.14 --> 5500.98]  far away
[5500.98 --> 5501.46]  have been
[5501.46 --> 5502.06]  brought near
[5502.06 --> 5502.72]  by the blood
[5502.72 --> 5503.32]  of Christ
[5503.32 --> 5504.44]  for he
[5504.44 --> 5505.02]  himself
[5505.02 --> 5506.22]  is our
[5506.22 --> 5506.68]  peace
[5506.68 --> 5507.26]  who has
[5507.26 --> 5507.66]  made the
[5507.66 --> 5508.20]  two groups
[5508.20 --> 5508.56]  one
[5508.56 --> 5508.90]  and has
[5508.90 --> 5509.36]  destroyed
[5509.36 --> 5509.88]  the barrier
[5509.88 --> 5510.54]  the dividing
[5510.54 --> 5511.02]  wall of
[5511.02 --> 5511.46]  hostility
[5511.46 --> 5512.22]  by setting
[5512.22 --> 5512.86]  aside his
[5512.86 --> 5513.22]  flesh
[5513.22 --> 5513.72]  the law
[5513.72 --> 5514.06]  with its
[5514.06 --> 5514.44]  commands
[5514.44 --> 5515.06]  and regulations
[5515.06 --> 5516.32]  his purpose
[5516.32 --> 5516.88]  was to
[5516.88 --> 5517.32]  create
[5517.32 --> 5518.20]  in himself
[5518.20 --> 5519.04]  one new
[5519.04 --> 5519.60]  humanity
[5519.60 --> 5520.30]  out of the
[5520.30 --> 5520.62]  two
[5520.62 --> 5521.92]  thus making
[5521.92 --> 5522.62]  peace
[5522.62 --> 5522.74]  peace
[5522.74 --> 5523.82]  and in
[5523.82 --> 5524.36]  one body
[5524.36 --> 5525.06]  to reconcile
[5525.06 --> 5525.58]  them
[5525.58 --> 5526.32]  both of
[5526.32 --> 5526.52]  them
[5526.52 --> 5527.02]  to God
[5527.02 --> 5527.42]  through the
[5527.42 --> 5527.82]  cross
[5527.82 --> 5528.38]  by which
[5528.38 --> 5528.82]  he put
[5528.82 --> 5529.46]  to death
[5529.46 --> 5530.18]  their
[5530.18 --> 5530.90]  hostility
[5530.90 --> 5532.74]  Jesus
[5532.74 --> 5533.40]  himself
[5533.40 --> 5534.16]  is our
[5534.16 --> 5534.64]  peace
[5534.64 --> 5535.20]  and he
[5535.20 --> 5535.70]  makes
[5535.70 --> 5536.44]  the body
[5536.44 --> 5537.38]  whole
[5537.38 --> 5538.38]  Jesus
[5538.38 --> 5539.26]  restores
[5539.26 --> 5539.98]  the church
[5539.98 --> 5540.34]  Jew
[5540.34 --> 5541.06]  and Gentile
[5541.06 --> 5541.48]  alike
[5541.48 --> 5542.86]  to wholeness
[5542.86 --> 5543.58]  that's
[5543.58 --> 5544.42]  peace
[5544.42 --> 5545.14]  and it is
[5545.14 --> 5545.62]  personal
[5545.62 --> 5546.38]  and it is
[5546.38 --> 5546.90]  communal
[5546.90 --> 5548.12]  shalom
[5548.12 --> 5548.80]  is union
[5548.80 --> 5549.42]  with God
[5549.42 --> 5550.20]  and communion
[5550.20 --> 5551.20]  with each
[5551.20 --> 5551.46]  other
[5551.46 --> 5552.38]  and he
[5552.38 --> 5553.16]  does that
[5553.16 --> 5554.00]  on the
[5554.00 --> 5554.48]  cross
[5554.48 --> 5555.78]  by his
[5555.78 --> 5556.30]  resurrection
[5556.30 --> 5557.58]  right
[5557.58 --> 5558.16]  that Jesus
[5558.16 --> 5559.10]  entered into
[5559.10 --> 5559.68]  the world
[5559.68 --> 5560.50]  as a little
[5560.50 --> 5560.88]  babe
[5560.88 --> 5561.72]  is great
[5561.72 --> 5562.40]  and cute
[5562.40 --> 5562.82]  but the
[5562.82 --> 5563.58]  story doesn't
[5563.58 --> 5564.16]  end there
[5564.16 --> 5564.48]  right
[5564.48 --> 5565.18]  because he
[5565.18 --> 5565.98]  grew into
[5565.98 --> 5566.40]  a man
[5566.40 --> 5566.66]  and he
[5566.66 --> 5566.96]  learned
[5566.96 --> 5567.42]  obedience
[5567.42 --> 5567.78]  and he
[5567.78 --> 5568.22]  became
[5568.22 --> 5568.72]  obedient
[5568.72 --> 5569.32]  unto
[5569.32 --> 5569.64]  death
[5569.64 --> 5569.90]  and that
[5569.90 --> 5570.22]  Jesus
[5570.22 --> 5571.04]  lived the
[5571.04 --> 5571.58]  life I
[5571.58 --> 5571.98]  should have
[5571.98 --> 5572.40]  lived
[5572.40 --> 5573.16]  and then
[5573.16 --> 5573.96]  even though
[5573.96 --> 5574.36]  innocent
[5574.36 --> 5575.04]  he died
[5575.04 --> 5575.54]  the death
[5575.54 --> 5575.92]  that I
[5575.92 --> 5576.34]  deserve
[5576.34 --> 5576.82]  for sin
[5576.82 --> 5577.26]  he died
[5577.26 --> 5577.62]  the death
[5577.62 --> 5577.88]  that we
[5577.88 --> 5578.48]  all deserve
[5578.48 --> 5579.24]  for our
[5579.24 --> 5579.74]  broken
[5579.74 --> 5580.48]  fellowship
[5580.48 --> 5581.38]  with God
[5581.38 --> 5582.48]  he took
[5582.48 --> 5583.04]  on that
[5583.04 --> 5583.82]  brokenness
[5583.82 --> 5584.36]  he who
[5584.36 --> 5585.30]  knew no
[5585.30 --> 5585.74]  sin
[5585.74 --> 5586.30]  culpable
[5586.30 --> 5586.74]  shalom
[5586.74 --> 5587.14]  breaking
[5587.14 --> 5589.14]  became sin
[5589.14 --> 5590.10]  for us
[5590.10 --> 5592.44]  so that we
[5592.44 --> 5593.26]  might become
[5593.26 --> 5594.02]  the righteousness
[5594.02 --> 5594.80]  of God
[5594.80 --> 5595.30]  so that we
[5595.30 --> 5595.80]  might be
[5595.80 --> 5596.44]  restored
[5596.44 --> 5597.74]  to God
[5597.74 --> 5598.86]  that's why
[5598.86 --> 5599.96]  he is called
[5599.96 --> 5600.56]  the prince
[5600.56 --> 5601.96]  of peace
[5601.96 --> 5603.40]  because his
[5603.40 --> 5603.98]  gospel
[5603.98 --> 5605.30]  accomplishes peace
[5605.30 --> 5605.94]  in your life
[5605.94 --> 5606.72]  and his rule
[5606.72 --> 5607.62]  over your life
[5607.62 --> 5608.50]  brings peace
[5608.50 --> 5609.30]  in your union
[5609.30 --> 5609.88]  with God
[5609.88 --> 5610.84]  and communion
[5610.84 --> 5611.54]  with others
[5611.54 --> 5614.02]  and to be
[5614.02 --> 5614.34]  honest
[5614.34 --> 5615.78]  that's already
[5615.78 --> 5616.30]  amazing
[5616.30 --> 5618.04]  but there's
[5618.04 --> 5618.40]  more
[5618.40 --> 5619.84]  because the
[5619.84 --> 5620.46]  story doesn't
[5620.46 --> 5620.98]  end there
[5620.98 --> 5622.44]  right there's
[5622.44 --> 5622.86]  more in
[5622.86 --> 5623.68]  in Revelation
[5623.68 --> 5625.30]  21 verse
[5625.30 --> 5625.98]  3 and 4
[5625.98 --> 5626.60]  John has
[5626.60 --> 5627.18]  this vision
[5627.18 --> 5627.66]  he says
[5627.66 --> 5628.50]  and I heard
[5628.50 --> 5629.28]  a loud voice
[5629.28 --> 5629.92]  from the throne
[5629.92 --> 5630.84]  saying look
[5630.84 --> 5632.08]  God's dwelling
[5632.08 --> 5633.08]  place is now
[5633.08 --> 5634.06]  among the people
[5634.06 --> 5634.88]  and he will
[5634.88 --> 5635.96]  dwell with them
[5635.96 --> 5637.02]  they will be
[5637.02 --> 5637.64]  his people
[5637.64 --> 5638.18]  and God
[5638.18 --> 5638.98]  himself will
[5638.98 --> 5639.56]  be with them
[5639.56 --> 5640.04]  and be
[5640.04 --> 5640.64]  their God
[5640.64 --> 5641.62]  he will wipe
[5641.62 --> 5642.76]  away every tear
[5642.76 --> 5643.80]  from their eyes
[5643.80 --> 5644.20]  and there'll be
[5644.20 --> 5644.90]  no more death
[5644.90 --> 5645.78]  or mourning
[5645.78 --> 5646.86]  or crying
[5646.86 --> 5647.54]  or pain
[5647.54 --> 5648.14]  for the old
[5648.14 --> 5648.84]  order of things
[5648.84 --> 5649.72]  has passed away
[5649.72 --> 5650.86]  right
[5650.86 --> 5651.78]  God's union
[5651.78 --> 5653.62]  with his people
[5653.62 --> 5654.88]  is restored
[5654.88 --> 5656.16]  right
[5656.16 --> 5656.78]  God's dwelling
[5656.78 --> 5657.38]  place is now
[5657.38 --> 5658.08]  among the people
[5658.08 --> 5658.72]  John says
[5658.72 --> 5660.08]  and our communion
[5660.08 --> 5661.46]  with each other
[5661.46 --> 5662.64]  is restored
[5662.64 --> 5664.06]  they will be
[5664.06 --> 5665.16]  his people
[5665.16 --> 5666.06]  and then
[5666.06 --> 5666.96]  everything
[5666.96 --> 5668.10]  that was undone
[5668.10 --> 5668.90]  that was broken
[5668.90 --> 5670.26]  in the rebellion
[5670.26 --> 5670.96]  at the garden
[5670.96 --> 5671.62]  of Eden
[5671.62 --> 5672.16]  right
[5672.16 --> 5673.22]  is restored
[5673.22 --> 5674.56]  to wholeness
[5674.56 --> 5675.78]  there's no more
[5675.78 --> 5676.16]  tears
[5676.16 --> 5676.74]  there's no more
[5676.74 --> 5677.04]  death
[5677.04 --> 5677.68]  there's no more
[5677.68 --> 5678.10]  crying
[5678.10 --> 5678.82]  or pain
[5678.82 --> 5679.30]  there's no more
[5679.30 --> 5679.80]  mourning
[5679.80 --> 5680.80]  for the old
[5680.80 --> 5681.56]  order of things
[5681.56 --> 5682.52]  has passed away
[5682.52 --> 5682.90]  right
[5682.90 --> 5683.90]  this new order
[5683.90 --> 5685.46]  is shalom
[5685.46 --> 5686.56]  restored
[5686.56 --> 5687.88]  right
[5687.88 --> 5688.36]  this is what
[5688.36 --> 5689.08]  Isaiah meant
[5689.08 --> 5689.98]  when he said
[5689.98 --> 5690.82]  of the greatness
[5690.82 --> 5691.54]  of his government
[5691.54 --> 5692.04]  and peace
[5692.04 --> 5692.84]  there will be
[5692.84 --> 5694.12]  no end
[5694.12 --> 5698.08]  this is why
[5698.08 --> 5699.24]  we have
[5699.24 --> 5699.88]  peace
[5699.88 --> 5701.44]  that lasts
[5701.44 --> 5702.66]  because it is a peace
[5702.66 --> 5703.52]  that is promised
[5703.52 --> 5705.36]  through eternity
[5705.36 --> 5708.54]  so here we are
[5708.54 --> 5710.78]  a people of peace
[5710.78 --> 5711.90]  who are already
[5711.90 --> 5712.58]  made whole
[5712.58 --> 5713.64]  and who are being
[5713.64 --> 5714.64]  made whole
[5714.64 --> 5715.76]  and who will be
[5715.76 --> 5716.82]  made whole
[5716.82 --> 5718.02]  that's why we can have
[5718.02 --> 5718.96]  peace in this life
[5718.96 --> 5720.24]  because on the cross
[5720.24 --> 5720.80]  your peace
[5720.80 --> 5721.66]  was accomplished
[5721.66 --> 5722.80]  because in the resurrection
[5722.80 --> 5723.72]  your peace
[5723.72 --> 5724.36]  was guaranteed
[5724.36 --> 5725.52]  and because in the
[5725.52 --> 5726.38]  consummation
[5726.38 --> 5727.50]  your peace
[5727.50 --> 5728.80]  will be fulfilled
[5728.80 --> 5732.68]  and so knowing
[5732.68 --> 5733.60]  what is to come
[5733.60 --> 5735.62]  that works backwards
[5735.62 --> 5737.38]  to today
[5737.38 --> 5739.64]  and so we wait
[5739.64 --> 5740.46]  for peace
[5740.46 --> 5742.36]  by living
[5742.36 --> 5743.70]  peace
[5743.70 --> 5745.16]  we wait for that
[5745.16 --> 5746.30]  ultimate restoration
[5746.30 --> 5747.32]  by living
[5747.32 --> 5748.44]  as people
[5748.44 --> 5749.40]  restored
[5749.40 --> 5750.92]  to wholeness
[5750.92 --> 5752.68]  Paul says
[5752.68 --> 5753.26]  to the church
[5753.26 --> 5754.74]  in Colossae
[5754.74 --> 5755.34]  he says
[5755.34 --> 5756.54]  let the peace
[5756.54 --> 5757.30]  of Christ
[5757.30 --> 5758.74]  rule in your hearts
[5758.74 --> 5759.90]  since as members
[5759.90 --> 5760.60]  of one body
[5760.60 --> 5761.40]  you were called
[5761.40 --> 5762.96]  to peace
[5762.96 --> 5764.62]  the video
[5764.62 --> 5765.16]  that we started
[5765.16 --> 5765.96]  the service with
[5765.96 --> 5767.04]  has
[5767.04 --> 5768.54]  Tim Mackey
[5768.54 --> 5768.96]  saying
[5768.96 --> 5769.68]  peace takes
[5769.68 --> 5770.38]  a lot of work
[5770.38 --> 5771.28]  because it's not
[5771.28 --> 5772.28]  just the absence
[5772.28 --> 5773.32]  of conflict
[5773.32 --> 5774.12]  true peace
[5774.12 --> 5775.36]  requires taking
[5775.36 --> 5775.96]  what's broken
[5775.96 --> 5776.84]  and restoring
[5776.84 --> 5777.76]  it to wholeness
[5777.76 --> 5779.04]  whether it's in our lives
[5779.04 --> 5779.86]  or in our relationships
[5779.86 --> 5780.70]  or in our world
[5780.70 --> 5784.46]  and you can only
[5784.46 --> 5785.76]  do that in your life
[5785.76 --> 5787.64]  you can only do that
[5787.64 --> 5788.32]  in the world
[5788.32 --> 5789.42]  when Christ
[5789.42 --> 5790.20]  has done it
[5790.20 --> 5790.82]  in your heart
[5790.82 --> 5792.40]  and in your mind
[5792.40 --> 5795.32]  one of the books
[5795.32 --> 5796.00]  that we gave
[5796.00 --> 5796.72]  Adam and Rachel
[5796.72 --> 5797.20]  this morning
[5797.20 --> 5797.66]  is a book
[5797.66 --> 5798.30]  by Paul Tripp
[5798.30 --> 5798.72]  it's called
[5798.72 --> 5799.04]  Ah
[5799.04 --> 5801.22]  in that book
[5801.22 --> 5802.08]  Paul Tripp
[5802.08 --> 5802.66]  says
[5802.66 --> 5803.78]  you will only have
[5803.78 --> 5805.16]  peace in the face
[5805.16 --> 5806.16]  of your own weakness
[5806.16 --> 5806.92]  failures
[5806.92 --> 5807.52]  foibles
[5807.52 --> 5808.30]  and inabilities
[5808.30 --> 5809.38]  when you are
[5809.38 --> 5810.22]  in awe
[5810.22 --> 5811.24]  of God's
[5811.24 --> 5811.96]  awesome
[5811.96 --> 5812.96]  power
[5812.96 --> 5815.48]  that's what it means
[5815.48 --> 5817.30]  to have the peace
[5817.30 --> 5817.98]  of Christ
[5817.98 --> 5819.80]  rule in your heart
[5819.80 --> 5821.24]  right
[5821.24 --> 5821.80]  and to have the peace
[5821.80 --> 5822.22]  of Christ
[5822.22 --> 5823.06]  rule in your heart
[5823.06 --> 5823.74]  we must first
[5823.74 --> 5824.80]  have the peace
[5824.80 --> 5825.62]  of Christ
[5825.62 --> 5827.50]  in us
[5827.50 --> 5828.72]  and around us
[5828.72 --> 5829.98]  and through us
[5829.98 --> 5830.96]  right
[5830.96 --> 5831.40]  if we're going to
[5831.40 --> 5832.18]  ever experience
[5832.18 --> 5833.14]  lasting peace
[5833.14 --> 5834.00]  in the community
[5834.00 --> 5835.76]  we need Christ
[5835.76 --> 5837.30]  ourselves
[5837.30 --> 5839.78]  and because of this
[5839.78 --> 5841.52]  rest
[5841.52 --> 5843.44]  because of this peace
[5843.44 --> 5844.38]  we can experience
[5844.38 --> 5845.54]  a sense of rest
[5845.54 --> 5846.96]  for the heart
[5846.96 --> 5847.74]  that has
[5847.74 --> 5848.76]  our grounding
[5848.76 --> 5849.74]  and it's grounding
[5849.74 --> 5851.36]  in being known
[5851.36 --> 5852.14]  by Jesus
[5852.14 --> 5853.08]  and knowing
[5853.08 --> 5854.08]  Jesus
[5854.08 --> 5855.70]  right
[5855.70 --> 5856.50]  because all of a sudden
[5856.50 --> 5857.90]  you can rest
[5857.90 --> 5859.92]  in his forgiveness
[5859.92 --> 5862.98]  you can rest
[5862.98 --> 5864.36]  in the truth
[5864.36 --> 5865.28]  that you don't need
[5865.28 --> 5866.78]  to be afraid
[5866.78 --> 5868.36]  of being exposed
[5868.36 --> 5870.60]  or being found out
[5870.60 --> 5872.08]  or being seen
[5872.08 --> 5873.24]  for who you really
[5873.24 --> 5874.24]  truly are
[5874.24 --> 5875.16]  because God
[5875.16 --> 5876.54]  has already seen you
[5876.54 --> 5877.40]  for who you really
[5877.40 --> 5878.12]  truly are
[5878.12 --> 5878.94]  he's seen
[5878.94 --> 5879.90]  the deepest
[5879.90 --> 5880.82]  darkest depths
[5880.82 --> 5881.50]  of your heart
[5881.50 --> 5882.52]  and he says
[5882.52 --> 5883.62]  you are my
[5883.62 --> 5884.90]  lavishly loved
[5884.90 --> 5885.78]  child
[5885.78 --> 5887.72]  and so you can
[5887.72 --> 5888.30]  have peace
[5888.30 --> 5890.54]  you can rest
[5890.54 --> 5891.72]  in his acceptance
[5891.72 --> 5893.14]  because in that
[5893.14 --> 5893.78]  you're freed
[5893.78 --> 5894.86]  from the roller coaster
[5894.86 --> 5895.90]  ride of other
[5895.90 --> 5897.30]  people's acceptance
[5897.30 --> 5899.34]  the gospel
[5899.34 --> 5900.58]  offers a true
[5900.58 --> 5901.12]  and better
[5901.12 --> 5901.82]  peace
[5901.82 --> 5902.82]  because Jesus
[5902.82 --> 5903.84]  is our
[5903.84 --> 5904.64]  peace
[5904.64 --> 5905.64]  and this Jesus
[5905.64 --> 5906.84]  is the same
[5906.84 --> 5907.36]  yesterday
[5907.36 --> 5908.22]  today
[5908.22 --> 5909.40]  and forever
[5909.40 --> 5910.84]  he doesn't change
[5910.84 --> 5911.68]  and so the peace
[5911.68 --> 5912.88]  that he offers
[5912.88 --> 5913.84]  doesn't fade
[5913.84 --> 5914.98]  or pass away
[5914.98 --> 5918.60]  let me end here
[5918.60 --> 5920.64]  yesterday
[5920.64 --> 5922.98]  I was driving
[5922.98 --> 5924.34]  with my kids
[5924.34 --> 5926.06]  and it had been
[5926.06 --> 5926.94]  a bit of a day
[5926.94 --> 5927.82]  we had done some
[5927.82 --> 5929.10]  driving around
[5929.10 --> 5929.70]  and traveling
[5929.70 --> 5932.38]  and we were
[5932.38 --> 5933.10]  at about
[5933.10 --> 5933.72]  the end
[5933.72 --> 5934.88]  of their ability
[5934.88 --> 5936.04]  to be kind
[5936.04 --> 5936.84]  and to communicate
[5936.84 --> 5937.34]  well
[5937.34 --> 5938.60]  and we were
[5938.60 --> 5939.70]  about at the end
[5939.70 --> 5940.92]  of our patience
[5940.92 --> 5941.96]  and the ability
[5941.96 --> 5942.68]  to do the same
[5942.68 --> 5942.94]  do you know
[5942.94 --> 5943.60]  what I'm talking about
[5943.60 --> 5945.70]  parents are understanding
[5945.70 --> 5946.84]  right
[5946.84 --> 5947.82]  it had been a long day
[5947.82 --> 5948.52]  it was full
[5948.52 --> 5949.98]  and we were ready
[5949.98 --> 5950.82]  for some type
[5950.82 --> 5951.36]  of break
[5951.36 --> 5953.36]  now all of that
[5953.36 --> 5953.84]  is said
[5953.84 --> 5954.92]  to set the context
[5954.92 --> 5957.48]  that while we were driving
[5957.48 --> 5959.22]  I also lost
[5959.22 --> 5959.84]  my patience
[5959.84 --> 5961.66]  and I was about
[5961.66 --> 5962.36]  to turn around
[5962.36 --> 5963.10]  and I was about
[5963.10 --> 5964.92]  to raise my voice
[5964.92 --> 5968.42]  and just before
[5968.42 --> 5968.94]  I did
[5968.94 --> 5969.52]  I thought
[5969.52 --> 5972.48]  tomorrow
[5972.48 --> 5973.34]  I have to stand
[5973.34 --> 5973.76]  up in front
[5973.76 --> 5974.52]  of this church
[5974.52 --> 5975.70]  and preach
[5975.70 --> 5976.38]  on the peace
[5976.38 --> 5976.90]  of Christ
[5976.90 --> 5979.96]  am I reflecting
[5979.96 --> 5980.54]  the peace
[5980.54 --> 5981.14]  of Christ
[5981.14 --> 5982.64]  in this moment
[5982.64 --> 5983.32]  right now
[5983.32 --> 5984.24]  with my kids
[5984.24 --> 5985.10]  in the car
[5985.10 --> 5987.70]  because I wasn't
[5987.70 --> 5988.18]  about to
[5988.18 --> 5991.14]  and that moment
[5991.14 --> 5991.96]  of pause
[5991.96 --> 5993.50]  stopped me
[5993.50 --> 5995.30]  and it changed
[5995.30 --> 5996.40]  the way I communicated
[5996.40 --> 5996.94]  and approached
[5996.94 --> 5997.40]  my kids
[5997.40 --> 5999.00]  but two things
[5999.00 --> 5999.30]  one
[5999.30 --> 6000.16]  I had to remind
[6000.16 --> 6001.34]  myself of that
[6001.34 --> 6001.90]  in the moment
[6001.90 --> 6002.54]  before it could
[6002.54 --> 6003.14]  take effect
[6003.14 --> 6003.86]  and really
[6003.86 --> 6004.48]  it was only
[6004.48 --> 6005.18]  the accountability
[6005.18 --> 6006.14]  of standing here
[6006.14 --> 6006.76]  in front of you
[6006.76 --> 6008.32]  telling this story
[6008.32 --> 6009.74]  that helped me
[6009.74 --> 6010.32]  do that
[6010.32 --> 6011.74]  but two
[6011.74 --> 6013.60]  I can promise you
[6013.60 --> 6014.48]  that over the next
[6014.48 --> 6014.98]  couple days
[6014.98 --> 6015.32]  and weeks
[6015.32 --> 6015.96]  I will lose
[6015.96 --> 6016.50]  my patience
[6016.50 --> 6017.26]  with my kids
[6017.26 --> 6019.52]  and that's not
[6019.52 --> 6019.98]  their fault
[6019.98 --> 6021.92]  right
[6021.92 --> 6022.92]  I will not have
[6022.92 --> 6024.08]  the spiritual maturity
[6024.08 --> 6024.94]  to think back
[6024.94 --> 6025.92]  on this moment
[6025.92 --> 6027.06]  this truth
[6027.06 --> 6027.60]  and quell
[6027.60 --> 6028.44]  my response
[6028.44 --> 6032.12]  that's why
[6032.12 --> 6032.86]  I'm grateful
[6032.86 --> 6034.64]  that Jesus
[6034.64 --> 6037.40]  is my peace
[6037.40 --> 6039.62]  because it's ultimately
[6039.62 --> 6041.30]  about what he has done
[6041.30 --> 6042.20]  in me
[6042.20 --> 6043.74]  what he has accomplished
[6043.74 --> 6044.66]  for me
[6044.66 --> 6045.78]  and so now
[6045.78 --> 6046.92]  I can strive
[6046.92 --> 6047.68]  to live
[6047.68 --> 6049.00]  like him
[6049.00 --> 6049.72]  and to live
[6049.72 --> 6050.58]  for him
[6050.58 --> 6052.26]  but my living
[6052.26 --> 6052.80]  like him
[6052.80 --> 6053.50]  or for him
[6053.50 --> 6054.22]  doesn't
[6054.22 --> 6055.36]  determine
[6055.36 --> 6057.04]  his living
[6057.04 --> 6057.78]  for me
[6057.78 --> 6060.16]  and it's
[6060.16 --> 6060.80]  that kind
[6060.80 --> 6061.46]  of peace
[6061.46 --> 6062.94]  that makes us
[6062.94 --> 6064.06]  sing it is well
[6064.06 --> 6065.74]  when there's chaos
[6065.74 --> 6066.76]  happening around us
[6066.76 --> 6068.48]  it's that kind
[6068.48 --> 6069.00]  of peace
[6069.00 --> 6070.14]  that makes us
[6070.14 --> 6071.72]  at funerals
[6071.72 --> 6073.00]  say
[6073.00 --> 6074.00]  be still
[6074.00 --> 6074.78]  and know
[6074.78 --> 6076.00]  that I am God
[6076.00 --> 6077.28]  even
[6077.28 --> 6078.14]  when in
[6078.14 --> 6079.08]  Psalm 46
[6079.08 --> 6080.16]  the chaotic
[6080.16 --> 6081.40]  waves of the oceans
[6081.40 --> 6082.06]  are crashing
[6082.06 --> 6083.24]  over us
[6083.24 --> 6084.66]  and so as
[6084.66 --> 6085.66]  we go into
[6085.66 --> 6086.22]  this week
[6086.22 --> 6087.08]  whatever chaos
[6087.08 --> 6088.54]  it may bring
[6088.54 --> 6089.46]  remember
[6089.46 --> 6090.72]  the peace
[6090.72 --> 6091.84]  of
[6091.84 --> 6092.94]  Christ
[6092.94 --> 6095.42]  and may you too
[6095.42 --> 6096.48]  let the peace
[6096.48 --> 6097.20]  of Christ
[6097.20 --> 6097.88]  rule
[6097.88 --> 6099.34]  in your hearts
[6099.34 --> 6100.18]  amen
[6100.18 --> 6101.52]  let's pray
[6101.52 --> 6105.68]  holy God
[6105.68 --> 6108.06]  grant us
[6108.06 --> 6109.18]  your peace
[6109.18 --> 6112.34]  and make us
[6112.34 --> 6114.54]  shalom makers
[6114.54 --> 6115.38]  in the world
[6115.38 --> 6116.58]  as we have
[6116.58 --> 6117.20]  been restored
[6117.20 --> 6117.78]  to you
[6117.78 --> 6119.34]  use us
[6119.34 --> 6120.30]  to show
[6120.30 --> 6121.86]  that wholeness
[6121.86 --> 6122.88]  made real
[6122.88 --> 6123.80]  in the lives
[6123.80 --> 6124.38]  and whomever

[6126.66 --> 6127.42]  season

[6129.96 --> 6130.60]  when we fall
[6130.60 --> 6130.94]  short
[6130.94 --> 6131.56]  when we
[6131.56 --> 6133.42]  don't experience
[6133.42 --> 6134.04]  the peace
[6134.04 --> 6134.74]  that we long
[6134.74 --> 6135.08]  for
[6135.08 --> 6136.74]  help us
