[509.96 → 539.94] Thank you.
[539.96 → 547.46] I'm going to ask, as you're able, if you would stand, and we will begin our worship and enter into God's presence together.
[547.88 → 558.78] One of the ways we mark and acknowledge God's presence here is by the presence of God, and so I invite you to open your heart, and so I invite you to open your heart, maybe even your hands to receive the greeting of God.
[558.78 → 560.78] Amen.
[588.78 → 618.78] Let's try that, and so let's try that, and so on.
[618.78 → 648.76] We're going to listen to God, and so we're going to say, and so we'll be, and so we're going to do this, and so we're going to do, and so on, and so we're going to join together in worship this morning.

[897.76 → 899.76] Come flood this place,
[899.76 → 901.76] And fill the atmosphere.
[901.76 → 905.76] Your glory, God,
[905.76 → 909.76] Is what our hearts long for,
[909.76 → 911.76] To Thee, O God,
[911.76 → 916.70] by your presence Lord.
[920.70 → 925.52] Your presence Lord.
[930.96 → 937.78] Let us become more aware of your presence.
[937.78 → 943.78] Let us experience the glory of your goodness.
[944.62 → 950.48] Let us become more aware of your presence.

[1016.74 → 1017.74] Let us feel your glory, God, is what our hearts long for.
[1017.74 → 1021.78] Our confession and our assurance this morning come from 2 Peter.
[1022.56 → 1025.44] 2 Peter 3, verses 8 to 9, read this way.
[1025.54 → 1025.84] It says,
[1025.84 → 1028.92] But do not forget this one thing, dear friends.
[1029.72 → 1032.06] With the Lord, a day is like a thousand years,
[1032.14 → 1033.88] and a thousand years are like a day.
[1034.56 → 1037.68] The Lord is not slow in keeping his promises,
[1038.50 → 1040.20] as some understand slowness.
[1041.20 → 1043.70] Instead, he is patient with you,
[1044.28 → 1046.12] not wanting anyone to perish,
[1046.70 → 1048.84] but everyone to come to repentance.
[1048.84 → 1076.72] We have prayed to you for rain.
[1076.72 → 1080.60] We have prayed for your compassion
[1080.60 → 1084.72] to heal the land again.
[1085.44 → 1088.76] There was a man in your presence,
[1089.30 → 1091.94] more hungry than before.
[1093.08 → 1096.00] Now we're on your steps of mercy,
[1096.92 → 1099.50] and we're knocking at your door.
[1099.50 → 1107.50] How long before you drench the air in the air?
[1107.50 → 1114.38] How long before we see your ancestors?
[1114.38 → 1122.22] How long before your name is lifted high?
[1122.22 → 1132.22] How long before the name returns to songs of joy?
[1132.22 → 1134.22] How long before I see you for rain?
[1134.22 → 1137.10] Lord, we know your heart is broken
[1137.10 → 1141.36] by the evil that you see,
[1141.48 → 1144.76] and in state your hand of judgment,
[1145.50 → 1148.22] for you let us stand and breathe.
[1149.40 → 1152.18] And the land is still in darkness,
[1153.12 → 1156.34] and we've fed the world's right.
[1156.34 → 1163.42] We have built a side of children who will never see your light.
[1163.76 → 1170.56] How long before you drench the better land?
[1170.88 → 1177.74] How long before you see your righteous hand?
[1178.12 → 1184.88] How long before your name is filled with high?
[1184.88 → 1194.42] How long before the leap returns to songs of joy?
[1196.78 → 1203.86] But before the day is coming, when the deaf will hear his voice,
[1204.30 → 1211.12] when the blind will see his halo and the lame will be for joy,
[1211.12 → 1218.24] when the will of God is high to sin, who will always love to try,
[1218.80 → 1225.16] and the order of God is water, who will never be the sky?
[1225.16 → 1232.48] How long before your glory lies in skies?
[1232.82 → 1239.16] How long before your rage is filled with high?
[1239.16 → 1246.72] How long before your grace is filled with high?
[1246.72 → 1256.26] How long before the earth resounds in songs of joy?
[1256.26 → 1259.40] How long before your grace is filled with high?
[1259.40 → 1261.94] Isaiah 30 verse 18 says,
[1262.92 → 1266.06] Yet the Lord longs to be gracious to you.
[1266.74 → 1270.06] Therefore he will rise up to show you compassion,
[1270.60 → 1272.72] for the Lord is a God of justice.
[1273.38 → 1275.76] Blessed are all who wait for him.
[1275.76 → 1297.86] All creation, all the earth
[1297.86 → 1302.68] May stay high in our Lord
[1302.68 → 1308.56] Jesus is coming soon
[1308.56 → 1315.36] Call out the sinner, wait out the saints
[1315.36 → 1320.18] Let every nation shout your name
[1320.18 → 1326.56] Jesus is coming soon
[1326.56 → 1333.78] Like a cry waiting for a room
[1333.78 → 1339.38] We'll be a church ready for you every hour
[1339.38 → 1342.72] Longing for our King
[1342.72 → 1347.72] We sing, hear Him so loud
[1347.72 → 1352.34] Lord Jesus, come
[1352.34 → 1356.50] Hear Him so loud
[1356.50 → 1360.72] Lord Jesus, come
[1360.72 → 1365.68] There will be justice
[1365.68 → 1369.84] All of you, your name forever
[1369.84 → 1372.06] Faithful and true
[1372.06 → 1377.68] Jesus is coming soon
[1377.68 → 1385.68] Like a cry waiting for a room
[1386.24 → 1391.76] We'll be a church ready for you every hour
[1391.76 → 1395.04] Longing for our King
[1395.04 → 1400.04] We sing, hear Him so loud
[1400.04 → 1404.08] Lord Jesus, come
[1404.08 → 1408.64] Hear Him so loud
[1408.64 → 1413.76] Lord Jesus, come
[1413.76 → 1416.04] God, we wait
[1416.04 → 1422.04] We wait, we wait for you
[1422.04 → 1430.04] God, we wait, you are coming soon
[1430.04 → 1438.04] God, we wait, we wait for you
[1438.04 → 1446.32] God, we wait, you are coming soon
[1446.32 → 1448.04] God, we wait, you are coming soon
[1448.04 → 1450.04] God, we wait, you are coming soon
[1450.04 → 1454.42] Like a cry waiting for a room
[1454.42 → 1459.78] We'll be a church ready for you every hour
[1459.78 → 1463.06] Longing for our King
[1463.06 → 1466.06] We sing, hear Him so loud
[1466.06 → 1471.38] Like a cry waiting for a room
[1471.38 → 1476.66] We'll be a church ready for you every hour
[1476.66 → 1479.86] Longing for our King
[1479.86 → 1484.70] We sing, hear Him so loud
[1484.70 → 1486.70] Lord Jesus, come
[1486.70 → 1488.70] Lord Jesus, come
[1488.70 → 1491.70] He is so loud
[1491.70 → 1496.70] Lord Jesus, come
[1496.70 → 1501.70] He is so loud
[1501.70 → 1506.70] Lord Jesus, come
[1506.70 → 1536.68] Lord Jesus, come
[1536.68 → 1564.12] strong
[1566.68 → 1571.08] A strong healer.
[1572.82 → 1577.16] You are the everlasting God.
[1577.16 → 1581.38] The everlasting God.
[1581.82 → 1584.90] You do not make you all.
[1585.28 → 1587.40] Grow weary.
[1588.70 → 1592.62] You're the defender of the weak.
[1592.62 → 1596.92] If the earth grows in me.
[1597.58 → 1600.54] You lift us up on me.
[1600.54 → 1603.14] My ego.
[1611.72 → 1613.28] Strength arises.
[1613.52 → 1615.24] We lay upon the Lord.
[1615.24 → 1617.22] We lay upon the Lord.
[1617.22 → 1619.66] We lay upon the Lord.
[1620.28 → 1621.40] Strength arises.
[1621.40 → 1623.40] We lay upon the Lord.
[1623.40 → 1625.36] We lay upon the Lord.
[1625.36 → 1627.36] We lay upon the Lord.
[1627.36 → 1628.82] Our God.
[1629.32 → 1633.12] You may forever.
[1634.24 → 1635.82] A home.
[1636.30 → 1640.12] A strong healer.
[1642.32 → 1646.28] You are the everlasting God.
[1646.28 → 1650.54] The everlasting God.
[1650.54 → 1653.96] You do not make you all.
[1653.96 → 1656.50] Grow weary.

[1665.60 → 1669.28] You lift us up on me.

[1695.76 → 1699.80] You lift us up on me.
[1699.80 → 1702.46] You lift me both.
[1702.46 → 1714.40] You may have a seat.
[1732.46 → 1747.84] Good morning. My name is Yap. I'm a deacon here at Langley Emanuel. We'll continue our worship with the giving of our gifts. First offering will be for the budget and the special offering is for the Gateway of Hope.
[1747.84 → 1764.44] The Gateway of Hope is a ministry of the Salvation Army in Canada. Serving the city and township of Langley, their mission is to help the homeless and those at risk with material assistance and other crucial supports in order to help them find hope and move forward.
[1765.56 → 1773.06] Over the years since they've opened, they have assisted many men and women to move out of homelessness for good and into healthy living.
[1774.06 → 1776.86] Please consider giving to this ministry as you're able to.
[1777.84 → 1787.12] From Proverbs 14 verse 31, whoever oppresses a poor man insults his maker, but he who is generous to the needy honours him.
[1790.18 → 1793.40] Next week's collection will be for Union Gospel Mission.
[1807.84 → 1826.66] Lord, you have my heart and I will search for yours.
[1826.66 → 1833.46] Jesus, take my heart and lead me alone.
[1835.66 → 1844.92] Lord, you have my heart and I will search for yours.
[1844.92 → 1850.36] Let me be to you a sacrifice.
[1850.36 → 1857.36] Lord, you have my heart and I will praise you, Lord.
[1857.36 → 1860.36] I will praise you, Lord.
[1860.36 → 1863.36] I will praise you, Lord.
[1863.36 → 1868.36] I will sing upon you.
[1868.36 → 1875.36] And as you show your praise.
[1875.36 → 1880.64] And as you show your praise.
[1880.64 → 1881.64] We'll see your glory.
[1881.64 → 1887.64] We'll see your glory.
[1887.64 → 1895.64] Lord, you have my heart and I will search for yours.
[1895.64 → 1902.64] Lord, you have my heart and I will search for yours.
[1902.64 → 1906.64] Jesus, take my heart and lead me alone.
[1906.64 → 1916.64] Lord, you have my heart and I will search for yours.
[1916.64 → 1923.64] Let me be to you a sacrifice.
[1923.64 → 1925.64] Let me be to you a sacrifice.
[1925.64 → 1930.64] And I will praise you, Lord.
[1930.64 → 1932.64] Lord, you have my heart and I will praise you.
[1932.64 → 1937.64] Lord, you have my heart and I will sing upon you.
[1937.64 → 1942.64] Lord, you have my heart and I will sing upon you.
[1942.64 → 1947.64] And as you show your praise.
[1947.64 → 1952.64] We'll see your glory.
[1952.64 → 1959.64] We'll see your glory.
[1959.64 → 1965.64] We'll see your glory.
[1965.64 → 1970.64] We'll see your glory.
[1976.64 → 1977.64] All right.
[1977.64 → 1981.64] I'm going to invite all the kids to come forward.
[1981.64 → 1983.64] You're going to come join me right up here at the front.
[1983.64 → 1984.64] Okay.
[1984.64 → 1988.64] So any kids age three to kindergarten, you can come right up.
[1988.64 → 1989.64] We'll sit right in the front.
[1989.64 → 1990.64] Right like this.
[1990.64 → 1991.64] Yeah.
[1991.64 → 1992.64] Here comes another.
[1992.64 → 1993.64] All right.
[1993.64 → 1994.64] Here comes some more.
[1994.64 → 1998.64] Come on up.
[1998.64 → 2002.64] Come on up.
[2002.64 → 2004.64] How's everybody's summer going?
[2004.64 → 2005.64] Yeah.
[2005.64 → 2006.64] Has it been so fun?
[2006.64 → 2008.64] Are you enjoying the sunshine?
[2008.64 → 2009.64] Yeah.
[2009.64 → 2010.64] Yeah.
[2010.64 → 2012.64] Well, we're going to go to children's worship time right now.
[2012.64 → 2013.64] But before we go, I'd like to pray.
[2013.64 → 2014.64] Okay.
[2014.64 → 2015.64] And then we'll do the kids blessing.
[2015.64 → 2016.64] Is that a good idea?
[2016.64 → 2017.64] Okay.
[2017.64 → 2019.64] So let's fold our hands, close our eyes and let's do a prayer.
[2019.64 → 2026.64] Father God, thank you that we could come to church this morning and that we could be here singing your praises and learning more about you.
[2026.64 → 2033.64] We pray that as these kids go to children's worship time and as the adults stay back here, God, that we will learn more about you and how to love one another.
[2033.64 → 2034.64] We pray this in your name.
[2034.64 → 2035.64] Amen.
[2035.64 → 2036.64] All right.
[2036.64 → 2037.64] There's only six of us.
[2037.64 → 2038.64] So we have to do this really loud.
[2038.64 → 2041.64] We're going to say the Lord be with you really loudly together.
[2041.64 → 2042.64] Okay.
[2042.64 → 2043.64] To the whole church.
[2043.64 → 2044.64] Are you ready?
[2044.64 → 2045.64] Can we do it?
[2045.64 → 2046.64] One, two, three.
[2046.64 → 2051.64] The Lord be with you and also with you.
[2051.64 → 2052.64] All right.
[2052.64 → 2053.64] You can head off to children's worship time.
[2053.64 → 2057.64] Thank you.
[2057.64 → 2059.64] Thank you.
[2059.64 → 2060.64] Thank you.
[2060.64 → 2062.64] Thank you.
[2066.64 → 2069.64] Thank you.
[2069.64 → 2071.64] Thank you.
[2071.64 → 2072.64] Good morning.
[2072.64 → 2084.64] What folder though?
[2084.64 → 2089.64] Hi, my name is Paul.
[2089.64 → 2095.64] I'm an elder here at Langley Emanuel, and it's my privilege to lead us in the family prayer.
[2095.64 → 2099.64] Before that, a couple of announcements.
[2099.64 → 2110.64] The funeral for Mike's mom, Alice Purism, will be held at Fort Langley Community Church at 1pm Tuesday this week.
[2111.64 → 2120.64] And next week is going to be Lord's Supper again, and we ask you to take that time to prepare yourselves for that.
[2120.64 → 2127.64] Think about that and ask the spirit to be with you for that time.
[2127.64 → 2133.64] Let's go to our Father in prayer.
[2133.64 → 2143.64] Father in heaven, you made the earth on which we stand.
[2143.64 → 2150.64] You gave us the air which we breathe and the beauty in the sky which we stand beneath.
[2150.64 → 2152.64] How vast is your creation.
[2152.64 → 2158.64] How immeasurable is the delicate balance and detail that we see.
[2158.64 → 2167.64] Psalm 46 says, God is our refuge and strength and every present help in trouble.
[2167.64 → 2175.64] Therefore, we will not fear, though the earth gives way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea.
[2175.64 → 2181.64] Though the waters roar and foam, the mountains quake with their surging.
[2182.64 → 2189.64] There's a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy place where the Most High dwells.
[2190.64 → 2196.64] God is with her, and she will not fall. God will help her at the break of day.
[2196.64 → 2205.64] Nations are in uproar, kingdoms fall. He lifts his voice and the earth melts.
[2205.64 → 2210.64] As we hear these words, we stand in awe of you, O Lord.
[2210.64 → 2217.64] And even so, you chase after us like a shepherd watches his sheep.
[2217.64 → 2222.64] You know us by name and pour out your grace through your redeeming love.
[2223.64 → 2229.64] We gather here in your name this morning to sing your praises and hear and study your word.
[2229.64 → 2232.64] We give you thanks for bringing us together as a church.
[2233.64 → 2236.64] We pray that you would bless us in our worship.
[2237.64 → 2242.64] As we have confessed our sin and accepted by faith your promised forgiveness.
[2242.64 → 2249.64] We thank you, Father, for this Lord's Day, for bringing your people into a preview of your kingdom.
[2250.64 → 2254.64] We know we can't truly comprehend the nature of your kingdom.
[2255.64 → 2261.64] But on this day, right here, right now, we know that it is wonderful and glorious.
[2262.64 → 2267.64] We thank you, O God, for Christ's church as we know it and see it around the world.
[2268.64 → 2270.64] And pray for your blessing on it.
[2270.64 → 2273.64] And we pray for those who are persecuted for your name.
[2273.64 → 2279.64] Thank you for your mercy and grace for always being there when we need you.
[2280.64 → 2286.64] When days are long and our troubles heavy, you are there to walk beside us.
[2287.64 → 2292.64] We have all come with individual and personal needs.
[2292.64 → 2296.64] Needs that we may not have shared with anyone else.
[2297.64 → 2300.64] But you know us and the struggles and the burdens we are facing.
[2300.64 → 2307.64] We mourn with the Ruizma family at the passing of Mike's mom, Alice, last week.
[2308.64 → 2314.64] May the peace of Christ and the hope of the resurrection bring comfort to all who mourn her loss.
[2314.64 → 2321.64] We pray for Ary Borges as she had to undergo a second surgery on her eye.
[2322.64 → 2331.64] We pray for Amy Iron as she has been in the hospital for the last number of weeks receiving treatment and care for her lung cancer.
[2331.64 → 2338.64] We pray for Amy and WIM and their daughters, Tanya and Danielle and Melanie.
[2339.64 → 2344.64] We pray for Paul Howling, Daniel's father who fell at work.
[2344.64 → 2349.64] We ask for your healing and grace to give him minimal pain and smooth recovery.
[2350.64 → 2357.64] We pray for the strained relationship between Louise Condo's parents and her brother and sister-in-law.
[2358.64 → 2361.64] And we ask you to give continued healing to Ellen White.
[2362.64 → 2366.64] We also celebrate with the Baker family.
[2367.64 → 2373.64] Leah and Adam Schroeder were married, and we ask that
[2374.64 → 2376.64] you bless their life together.
[2377.64 → 2383.64] We pray for those who are pregnant during the hot summer months and ask for healthy pregnancies and energy for each day.
[2387.64 → 2390.64] During this time of year there are many forest fires happening.
[2391.64 → 2396.64] We pray for safety for the firefighters, the pilots, the ground crews and support staff.
[2397.64 → 2400.64] We ask that you will watch and keep care of those who are being evacuated.
[2400.64 → 2409.64] We pray for Sylvia Welding who undergoes surgery and needs to condolence at home for some time.
[2410.64 → 2411.64] We ask for continued healing there.
[2412.64 → 2415.64] Summer and vacation is here.
[2416.64 → 2421.64] We pray for safe travels and a time of rejuvenation for our church family members.
[2421.64 → 2433.64] We ask for those who are caring for their aging parents that you give peace and patience and strength on both sides of those relationships.
[2433.64 → 2439.64] O Lord continue to keep those who mourn the loss of a loved one.
[2440.64 → 2450.64] Whether recently or in the past we ask that you continue to help them find their new normal however long that lasts.
[2450.64 → 2456.64] We ask for those who are struggling with their mental health and those who are struggling with their mental health.
[2457.64 → 2461.64] Whatever the reason may be that they may feel your presence walking alongside them.
[2462.64 → 2468.64] And we continue to think of and pray for those who are struggling with their mental health.
[2469.64 → 2472.64] And those that walk alongside and support them.
[2472.64 → 2477.64] O God we pray hear us.
[2478.64 → 2481.64] Look upon the list of our concerns.
[2482.64 → 2484.64] We know that you knew it before we wrote it down.
[2485.64 → 2491.64] And we know that you know better than us what must be prayed in each of these circumstances.
[2492.64 → 2496.64] And we ask for your Holy Spirit to complete that for us.
[2496.64 → 2500.64] Look into the deep recesses of our hearts.
[2501.64 → 2505.64] The pains, the fears and the bitterness, our distresses and our disappointments.
[2506.64 → 2516.64] We lay these all before you and ask that by your Holy Spirit they may be prayed for effectively in the groanings that we cannot utter.
[2516.64 → 2524.64] We read in your scriptures Father that your Son prayed that we might be one.
[2525.64 → 2531.64] And we ask that your Spirit will continue to continually be about the work of bringing that true.
[2532.64 → 2536.64] We give you thanks O God especially for the ongoing ministries of this church.
[2537.64 → 2541.64] And we ask that they continue to help us be a light to the surrounding communities.
[2541.64 → 2549.64] We pray for our church leaders, Pastor Kevin and Josh and all those who serve in the various capacities in different ministries.
[2550.64 → 2554.64] And now as we open your word to us, we ask that you will be with Pastor Chris.
[2555.64 → 2561.64] That the words he speaks may be the work, may work in our hearts through your Spirit.
[2562.64 → 2566.64] Father we pray that our eyes would be fixed on Jesus.
[2566.64 → 2572.64] We pray that by your Spirit you might bring it to our hearts to believe and to trust in you.
[2573.64 → 2575.64] For all things we pray,
[2576.64 → 2579.64] them not because we are worthy, but in Jesus name alone. Amen.
[2579.64 → 2580.64] Amen.
[2580.64 → 2581.64] Amen.
[2581.64 → 2582.64] Amen.
[2582.64 → 2583.64] Amen.
[2583.64 → 2584.64] Amen.
[2584.64 → 2585.64] Amen.
[2585.64 → 2586.64] Amen.
[2600.64 → 2601.64] Amen.
[2601.64 → 2606.64] This morning we're going to read from Hebrews 11, continuing in our series.
[2606.64 → 2609.64] And I'm going to invite Nora to come to the front.
[2609.64 → 2612.64] She's going to read it for us.
[2612.64 → 2613.64] It will be on the screen.
[2613.64 → 2617.64] If you have a Bible either in your hands or on a device, I encourage you to follow along.
[2617.64 → 2627.64] By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going.
[2628.64 → 2631.64] By faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger in a foreign country.
[2631.64 → 2637.64] He lived in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise.
[2637.64 → 2642.64] For he was looking forward to this city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God.
[2642.64 → 2651.64] And by faith even Sarah, who was past childbearing age, was unable to bear children, because she considered him faithful, who had made the promise.
[2651.64 → 2660.64] And so from this one man, and he as good as dead, came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless on the sand as the seashore.
[2661.64 → 2664.64] All these people were still living by faith when they died.
[2664.64 → 2666.64] They did not receive the things promised.
[2666.64 → 2672.64] They only saw them and welcomed them from a distance, admitting that they were foreigners and strangers on earth.
[2672.64 → 2677.64] People who did say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own.
[2677.64 → 2681.64] If they had been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had an opportunity to return.
[2681.64 → 2685.64] Instead, they were longing for a better country, a heavenly one.
[2685.64 → 2689.64] Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.
[2689.64 → 2694.64] By faith Abraham, when God tested him, offered Isaac as a sacrifice.
[2694.64 → 2698.64] He who had embraced the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son.
[2698.64 → 2702.64] Even though God said to him, it is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.
[2702.64 → 2705.64] Abraham reasoned that God could even raise the dead.
[2705.64 → 2708.64] And so in manner of speaking, he did receive Isaac back from the death.
[2708.64 → 2710.64] This is the word of the Lord.
[2710.64 → 2712.64] Thanks be to God.
[2713.64 → 2714.64] Thanks sweetheart.
[2719.64 → 2720.64] Thank you.
[2720.64 → 2738.64] This summer we have been telling stories together.
[2738.64 → 2748.64] Stories from people in the Old Testament and stories from people in our own lives that have shaped our faith and our experience of God.
[2748.64 → 2754.46] Now we've been calling these stories' faith hero stories,
[2754.46 → 2764.30] and we've been challenging each other to share our own life and story of God at work in our midst,
[2764.98 → 2766.22] and sharing that with other people.
[2769.10 → 2778.16] Because here's the thing, stories and the kinds of stories we tell matter.
[2779.16 → 2783.68] Not only from a religious perspective, but from a psychological perspective,
[2784.08 → 2787.40] we use stories to make sense of the world.
[2788.22 → 2792.94] We use stories to define ourselves and our histories,
[2793.50 → 2799.62] and to bring clarity to what we do and who we are and how we be in the midst of each other.
[2800.18 → 2806.16] We use stories to share our anticipation and our hope for a future.
[2806.16 → 2811.62] Stories are part of your makeup.
[2812.98 → 2816.94] Stories are part of how you see God at work in the world,
[2817.04 → 2822.08] not only in the Bible and through these people, but even today and now.
[2823.34 → 2826.50] And so the kinds of stories we tell matter.
[2826.50 → 2836.52] The kinds of stories or the story that we root ourselves in is critical for how we see and be in the world.
[2837.48 → 2839.60] Let me just make this point really quickly.
[2840.02 → 2842.56] There are a few authors here.
[2842.78 → 2845.98] Green and Bartholomew, in their book, The Drama of Scripture,
[2845.98 → 2854.34] they say which story a person lives out of makes a huge difference in how one interprets events in life.
[2855.52 → 2864.16] Leslie Newborn, who was a missionary to India from England and a missiologies after someone who studies and teaches mission,
[2864.38 → 2871.70] he says that the way we understand human life depends on what conception we have of the human story.
[2871.70 → 2875.74] What is the real story of which my life is a part?
[2876.48 → 2880.22] Similarly, Alistair MacIntyre, who's a philosopher, he says,
[2880.52 → 2889.04] I can only answer the question, what am I to do, if I can answer the prior question of what story do I find myself a part?
[2890.16 → 2894.54] The story you live and the stories you tell matter.
[2894.54 → 2900.54] And sometimes we sell our own stories short.
[2901.20 → 2905.32] Or sometimes we think our stories don't matter.
[2905.68 → 2910.54] And we do this sort of from a 30,000-foot view as a system, but also individually.
[2913.54 → 2915.58] There's a Hindu scholar.
[2916.18 → 2917.86] His name is Maranatha.
[2918.32 → 2919.42] He's a Hindu scholar.
[2919.42 → 2920.24] And he says,
[2920.70 → 2926.96] As I read the Bible, I find in it a quite unique interpretation of universal history,
[2927.46 → 2932.60] and therefore a unique understanding of the human person as a responsible actor in history.
[2933.44 → 2939.90] You Christian missionaries have talked of the Bible as if it were simply another book of religion.
[2942.46 → 2945.98] Sometimes we do that.
[2945.98 → 2950.50] We miss the importance of the Bible.
[2950.70 → 2955.02] We miss the importance of God's story of being at work in the world in creation,
[2955.44 → 2959.30] in the rebellion of humanity against God and his work to redeem us,
[2959.40 → 2965.50] and his eventual work to restore all things to his grand design and purpose.
[2966.44 → 2968.38] We also do that in our own lives.
[2969.20 → 2969.70] Right?
[2969.74 → 2970.36] Where we think,
[2970.64 → 2972.58] Ah, my story's kind of boring.
[2972.58 → 2973.82] Right?
[2973.84 → 2978.18] I don't have a grand, dramatic testimony of God changing everything about my life.
[2978.30 → 2978.64] Right?
[2978.68 → 2979.72] We look at our lives, and we go,
[2979.80 → 2980.22] You know what?
[2980.26 → 2981.66] I've been raised in the church.
[2981.66 → 2982.72] I've grown up here.
[2982.88 → 2984.40] I've gone to youth group.
[2984.50 → 2985.82] I became a young adult.
[2986.62 → 2988.32] Maybe I got married here.
[2988.40 → 2989.08] I had kids.
[2989.16 → 2989.90] They were baptized.
[2990.26 → 2992.26] My kids are now going through youth,
[2992.34 → 2993.24] or they're young adults,
[2993.24 → 2995.18] and they're having kids who are getting baptized.
[2995.98 → 2997.20] I look at my life,
[2997.24 → 3000.12] and I just don't ever see a time when God wasn't active,
[3000.30 → 3001.28] where I didn't know him.
[3001.28 → 3003.56] And that's kind of boring.
[3004.94 → 3006.18] I've got to tell you,
[3006.50 → 3009.82] as someone who has a bit of a different story than that,
[3010.34 → 3012.78] that's the story I long for with my kids.
[3013.40 → 3014.80] That's the one I pray for.
[3015.46 → 3015.90] Right?
[3015.96 → 3019.80] And I think the huge blessing and promise of God in that,
[3019.90 → 3024.84] in seeing those kinds of stories as testimonies of God's faithfulness.
[3025.36 → 3028.26] But sometimes we sell our own stories short.
[3028.26 → 3030.64] This morning,
[3031.42 → 3035.62] as we zero in together on the story of Abraham,
[3036.42 → 3038.34] now if you know the story of Abraham,
[3038.60 → 3040.38] he wasn't always called Abraham.
[3040.64 → 3042.00] He starts off as Abram,
[3042.04 → 3043.40] and then eventually his name is changed.
[3043.74 → 3045.34] I'm going to refer to him as Abraham,
[3045.72 → 3048.06] because that seems to be the one we're all familiar with.
[3048.14 → 3051.26] And the end of the story is the part that really matters at the end.
[3051.32 → 3053.40] And so I'm going to use his name from the end of the story,
[3053.46 → 3055.14] even if I'm reading it back into the beginning.
[3055.14 → 3057.46] But in the story of Abraham,
[3057.78 → 3060.98] we are going to look and hopefully be challenged
[3060.98 → 3067.64] to see how God uses our story for his glory.
[3068.76 → 3073.32] Because the story of Abraham becomes the story of the church,
[3073.56 → 3077.82] and the calling of Abraham is the calling of the church.
[3078.84 → 3082.02] And so here's what I hope that we will see this morning.
[3082.02 → 3088.14] Abraham was called to go into a land he did not know,
[3088.22 → 3090.34] a land he knew not of,
[3090.52 → 3094.32] and he went because of the promises of God.
[3095.88 → 3099.84] Similarly, my contention to you is that we, as a church,
[3099.88 → 3104.18] are being called to go into a land we know not of,
[3104.18 → 3107.06] and like Abraham,
[3107.46 → 3111.34] we must rely on the promises of God
[3111.34 → 3113.62] in order to go forward
[3113.62 → 3117.90] and to see what God will do with our story.
[3118.94 → 3121.92] Now, to make the most sense of Abraham's story,
[3122.16 → 3123.40] we need to start from the beginning,
[3124.00 → 3126.48] before Abraham is introduced.
[3126.88 → 3130.04] Start in the story of Genesis,
[3130.36 → 3132.00] where you can read about Abraham.
[3132.00 → 3133.78] You have Adam and Eve,
[3133.90 → 3136.32] who are the first created humans,
[3136.50 → 3138.52] and out of their bonding,
[3138.60 → 3139.48] you have Cain and Abel.
[3139.56 → 3142.62] We looked at the story of Abel earlier in this series.
[3144.90 → 3148.18] They have a third son named Seth.
[3149.10 → 3151.12] And then through a number of generations,
[3151.70 → 3153.24] one of Seth's descendants,
[3153.56 → 3155.14] many, many years later, is Noah.
[3155.84 → 3157.52] Now, with Noah, we know the story,
[3157.58 → 3158.70] and again, we've looked at it.
[3158.70 → 3160.74] There's the sort of great reset, right?
[3161.66 → 3163.58] And Noah's oldest son,
[3163.64 → 3166.20] who entered into the ark with Noah
[3166.20 → 3168.82] and his wife and brothers and their wives,
[3168.92 → 3170.04] his oldest son,
[3171.30 → 3172.52] named Seth,
[3173.88 → 3174.66] or Shem,
[3174.84 → 3176.90] carries the line forward,
[3177.66 → 3179.44] again, a number of generations,
[3179.44 → 3182.24] to a man named Torah.
[3183.30 → 3184.90] Torah, we know,
[3184.90 → 3186.92] is Abraham's father.
[3188.14 → 3191.88] Torah lives in the land of Your of the Chaldeans,
[3192.18 → 3196.58] which is sort of east of modern-day Israel in that area.
[3197.68 → 3200.40] Now, in Joshua 24, verse 2,
[3200.60 → 3202.10] Joshua says to the people,
[3202.26 → 3204.46] as they are coming back into the land,
[3204.54 → 3205.94] having gone through the conquest,
[3206.40 → 3208.50] Joshua says to all the people,
[3208.50 → 3209.88] this is what the Lord,
[3210.02 → 3211.42] the God of Israel, says,
[3211.94 → 3213.64] long ago, your ancestors,
[3213.94 → 3214.98] including Torah,
[3215.14 → 3217.06] the father of Abraham and Na hor,
[3217.64 → 3219.46] lived beyond the Euphrates River
[3219.46 → 3222.36] and worshipped other gods.
[3223.24 → 3224.56] And it's that last line,
[3224.68 → 3225.76] and worshipped other gods,
[3225.80 → 3228.28] that I want us to just hold to for a moment.
[3228.96 → 3230.22] Because from Noah,
[3230.46 → 3231.40] in the story of Noah,
[3231.48 → 3232.72] you have this one family
[3232.72 → 3235.38] that is the sign of hope for the world
[3235.38 → 3237.22] and the promise of God, right,
[3237.30 → 3239.08] comes to us through them.
[3239.94 → 3242.56] To the generations down to Torah,
[3243.04 → 3244.76] hope and that faith,
[3245.00 → 3246.82] that belief in the creator God,
[3246.98 → 3248.84] it's been lost.
[3250.02 → 3251.44] It's gone, right?
[3251.52 → 3253.38] Torah worshipped other gods.
[3254.22 → 3256.76] So there's no hope for humanity left.
[3256.82 → 3259.52] There's no memory of the living God.
[3259.64 → 3261.80] There's no hope in the land.
[3261.80 → 3263.88] And so hope has to come
[3263.88 → 3265.80] from outside the land.
[3266.92 → 3268.32] This is where God comes in.
[3269.96 → 3271.12] God comes to Abraham,
[3271.42 → 3272.30] and he says,
[3272.34 → 3273.38] it starts with a call,
[3273.50 → 3274.00] he says,
[3274.44 → 3275.48] leave your country,
[3275.80 → 3276.48] your people,
[3276.66 → 3277.84] and your father's household,
[3278.02 → 3279.34] and go to the land
[3279.34 → 3281.12] I will show you.
[3282.76 → 3283.64] Now hear this, right?
[3283.68 → 3285.42] Unless God calls you,
[3285.82 → 3288.44] his promises will never be real to you.
[3289.54 → 3291.10] But then notice, right,
[3291.10 → 3292.34] in Abraham's story
[3292.34 → 3294.30] and what Hebrews is picking up on
[3294.30 → 3295.38] for us
[3295.38 → 3298.92] is that this is God-active language.
[3299.12 → 3301.30] This is God at work in the world
[3301.30 → 3304.16] in the midst of his people, right?
[3304.22 → 3305.06] God is at work,
[3305.16 → 3308.50] but it's also church-active language.
[3308.70 → 3311.06] It's also us-active language.
[3311.20 → 3312.80] We have to respond.
[3312.96 → 3315.08] We have to be part of God's work
[3315.08 → 3315.60] in the world
[3315.60 → 3317.64] because of his promises
[3317.64 → 3318.98] to the world.
[3318.98 → 3322.02] And God gives these kinds of promises
[3322.02 → 3323.76] all throughout Scripture.
[3323.90 → 3324.64] We don't have time.
[3324.80 → 3326.26] We're going to go through each one,
[3326.34 → 3327.10] but let me give you just
[3327.10 → 3328.42] an indicative sampling.
[3329.28 → 3331.00] Jeremiah 1, verse 5,
[3331.50 → 3333.30] Before I formed you in the womb,
[3333.40 → 3334.22] I knew you.
[3334.48 → 3335.54] Before you were born,
[3335.68 → 3337.18] I set you apart.
[3337.66 → 3339.02] That is, I gave you a purpose,
[3339.18 → 3339.96] he says to Jeremiah.
[3340.44 → 3342.56] Isaiah 46, verse 4,
[3342.56 → 3344.84] Even to your old age and gray hairs,
[3344.98 → 3345.84] I am he.
[3346.18 → 3348.34] I am he who will sustain you.
[3348.44 → 3349.44] I have made you.
[3349.74 → 3350.86] I will carry you.
[3351.08 → 3352.42] I will sustain you.
[3352.42 → 3354.60] And I will rescue you.
[3355.20 → 3358.26] The promises of God for his people.
[3358.44 → 3359.80] And then Jeremiah 29, 11,
[3360.16 → 3362.00] For I know the plans I have for you,
[3362.12 → 3362.84] declares the Lord.
[3362.96 → 3364.10] Plans to prosper you
[3364.10 → 3365.16] and not to harm you.
[3365.28 → 3366.46] Plans to give you a hope
[3366.46 → 3367.84] and a future.
[3369.20 → 3370.76] Over and over and over again
[3370.76 → 3371.36] in Scripture,
[3371.60 → 3373.58] just like spoken to Abraham,
[3373.90 → 3377.54] God's promises are many and sure.
[3378.38 → 3380.34] And with his call,
[3380.34 → 3382.76] those promises pull us
[3382.76 → 3385.56] into unknown places.
[3389.90 → 3393.14] In his book on Christian leadership
[3393.14 → 3394.66] in the 21st century,
[3395.20 → 3396.40] Todd Bollinger,
[3397.18 → 3398.72] he asks,
[3398.72 → 3400.86] what does it look like
[3400.86 → 3401.90] for the church
[3401.90 → 3403.86] to go off the map?
[3405.44 → 3407.00] Now he's using that phrase intentionally.
[3407.14 → 3408.30] He, in his book,
[3408.42 → 3409.90] bases it on the story
[3409.90 → 3411.80] of Lewis and Clark.
[3412.96 → 3413.98] Lewis and Clark
[3413.98 → 3415.86] in the age of American expansionism
[3416.50 → 3419.32] were mapping out
[3419.32 → 3421.32] the westward growth
[3421.32 → 3422.54] of the country.
[3423.38 → 3425.14] And the plan that they had
[3425.14 → 3425.70] at the beginning
[3425.70 → 3427.56] was to canoe
[3427.56 → 3429.62] down the Missouri River
[3429.62 → 3430.74] and to the west
[3430.74 → 3432.04] until they hit
[3432.04 → 3432.86] the next ocean.
[3434.22 → 3435.16] And so they packed
[3435.16 → 3436.02] their gear
[3436.02 → 3437.08] into the canoe
[3437.08 → 3438.52] and away they went.
[3439.60 → 3440.82] And for a time,
[3440.94 → 3441.16] right,
[3441.20 → 3441.72] it was good
[3441.72 → 3442.46] and that worked.
[3442.78 → 3443.40] They tracked
[3443.40 → 3444.54] mile after mile
[3444.54 → 3445.38] down the river
[3445.38 → 3446.88] paddling away
[3446.88 → 3447.72] from horizon
[3447.72 → 3448.78] in the morning
[3448.78 → 3450.18] to the next horizon
[3450.18 → 3451.26] in the evening.
[3451.42 → 3452.70] Away they went.
[3452.92 → 3453.74] Down and down
[3453.74 → 3454.76] they went for weeks
[3454.76 → 3455.52] and for months.
[3457.50 → 3458.20] But you know
[3458.20 → 3458.62] what happened?
[3460.84 → 3461.82] They ran into
[3461.82 → 3462.82] a little mountain range
[3462.82 → 3464.66] called the Rockies.
[3465.82 → 3466.84] And all of a sudden,
[3467.00 → 3467.58] their canoe
[3467.58 → 3469.10] was no longer
[3469.10 → 3469.82] the right tool
[3469.82 → 3470.44] for the job.
[3471.86 → 3472.18] Right?
[3472.22 → 3473.50] They had to reimagine
[3473.50 → 3474.56] the journey.
[3474.70 → 3475.24] They had to make
[3475.24 → 3476.14] a new plan.
[3476.80 → 3476.92] Right?
[3476.94 → 3477.58] The equipment
[3477.58 → 3478.54] that they had,
[3478.80 → 3479.08] right,
[3479.28 → 3480.68] that they prepared for
[3480.68 → 3481.84] was based off
[3481.84 → 3482.56] of a map
[3482.56 → 3483.72] that they had
[3483.72 → 3484.42] already made
[3484.42 → 3485.28] but they were
[3485.28 → 3485.92] off the map.
[3487.12 → 3488.04] They were somewhere
[3488.04 → 3488.94] totally new.
[3490.42 → 3490.92] A canoe
[3490.92 → 3491.98] isn't going to help
[3491.98 → 3492.86] you get up a mountain.
[3494.96 → 3495.72] And so they had
[3495.72 → 3496.56] to figure out
[3496.56 → 3498.04] how to traverse it.
[3499.26 → 3500.10] Bollinger's point
[3500.10 → 3500.88] in that book
[3500.88 → 3501.34] is that
[3501.34 → 3502.60] that's where
[3502.60 → 3503.74] the church is
[3503.74 → 3505.66] in the 21st century.
[3506.58 → 3507.02] Right?
[3507.06 → 3508.18] In the 21st century
[3508.18 → 3509.12] western world,
[3509.12 → 3510.64] we've been canoeing
[3510.64 → 3511.84] along just fine
[3511.84 → 3512.66] for maybe
[3512.66 → 3513.60] a thousand years.
[3515.54 → 3516.64] But now the Rockies
[3516.64 → 3517.42] are in front of us.
[3519.08 → 3520.20] Maybe they're even here.
[3521.82 → 3523.10] We're off the map
[3523.10 → 3525.24] and we need to come up
[3525.24 → 3526.26] with something new
[3526.26 → 3527.34] to traverse
[3527.34 → 3527.90] what's ahead.
[3528.90 → 3529.36] Right?
[3529.42 → 3530.48] We have never been
[3530.48 → 3531.06] the church
[3531.06 → 3532.48] in the 21st century.
[3533.66 → 3534.88] We've never been
[3534.88 → 3535.44] Christians
[3535.44 → 3536.54] in an increasingly
[3536.54 → 3537.74] post-Christian
[3537.74 → 3538.84] society.
[3539.12 → 3541.82] But it's only
[3541.82 → 3542.38] going to get
[3542.38 → 3543.22] more difficult
[3543.22 → 3544.50] to be faithful
[3544.50 → 3545.64] disciples of Jesus
[3545.64 → 3546.52] in the modern
[3546.52 → 3547.84] western world.
[3549.22 → 3550.00] That is,
[3550.06 → 3550.72] if we want to
[3550.72 → 3551.54] hang on to
[3551.54 → 3552.86] our distinctive
[3552.86 → 3553.66] about being Christian,
[3553.72 → 3554.66] if we want to hang on
[3554.66 → 3556.16] to the peculiarities
[3556.16 → 3557.24] that make us
[3557.24 → 3558.12] the people of God.
[3559.32 → 3559.64] Right?
[3559.70 → 3560.86] There will come a day,
[3560.90 → 3562.38] if it hasn't already come,
[3562.78 → 3563.96] when the presumption
[3563.96 → 3565.48] of Christian privilege
[3565.48 → 3567.30] will no longer
[3567.30 → 3567.98] be possible.
[3567.98 → 3568.08] people.
[3569.78 → 3570.02] Now,
[3570.86 → 3573.46] if you've heard me
[3573.46 → 3574.32] on this before,
[3574.50 → 3575.48] you know that part
[3575.48 → 3575.92] of me,
[3577.20 → 3577.98] as terrifying
[3577.98 → 3578.94] as it may be,
[3580.12 → 3580.94] thinks that's probably
[3580.94 → 3581.70] a good thing.
[3583.76 → 3583.98] Right?
[3584.06 → 3585.78] When you can't tell
[3585.78 → 3586.62] the difference
[3586.62 → 3587.38] between people
[3587.38 → 3588.02] who profess
[3588.02 → 3588.88] to be Christian
[3588.88 → 3589.98] from people
[3589.98 → 3591.28] who act
[3591.28 → 3592.02] or profess
[3592.02 → 3592.56] blatantly
[3592.56 → 3594.30] against Christianity,
[3594.30 → 3596.06] you've got a problem.
[3597.78 → 3598.54] And there are
[3598.54 → 3599.02] sometimes
[3599.02 → 3599.50] we look around
[3599.50 → 3599.80] the world,
[3599.88 → 3600.56] that's what we see.
[3601.52 → 3602.22] When people
[3602.22 → 3603.52] who attend church
[3603.52 → 3604.62] look and act
[3604.62 → 3605.12] and talk
[3605.12 → 3606.08] exactly the same
[3606.08 → 3606.98] as everyone else,
[3607.64 → 3608.58] except for those
[3608.58 → 3609.86] hour and a half
[3609.86 → 3611.74] or two hours
[3611.74 → 3612.26] if you're here
[3612.26 → 3613.52] on a communion Sunday,
[3613.78 → 3615.88] that's a problem.
[3615.88 → 3619.06] But that's not
[3619.06 → 3619.94] all that I mean
[3619.94 → 3620.88] when I talk
[3620.88 → 3621.94] about losing
[3621.94 → 3622.82] the presumption
[3622.82 → 3624.12] of privilege.
[3625.38 → 3626.38] Matt Tuning
[3626.38 → 3627.84] is a professor
[3627.84 → 3628.54] of ethics
[3628.54 → 3629.52] at Calvin Seminary.
[3630.56 → 3631.50] He's wondered
[3631.50 → 3632.20] about this
[3632.20 → 3633.14] in his own writing
[3633.14 → 3633.72] when it comes
[3633.72 → 3634.76] to ethics.
[3634.98 → 3635.44] He says that
[3635.44 → 3636.16] no longer
[3636.16 → 3636.88] can you talk
[3636.88 → 3638.10] about ethics,
[3638.60 → 3639.46] the way people
[3639.46 → 3640.16] should behave
[3640.16 → 3642.26] or certain behaviours,
[3642.26 → 3643.14] assuming
[3643.14 → 3644.76] a universal
[3644.76 → 3645.64] moral order.
[3647.12 → 3647.88] No longer,
[3648.12 → 3649.06] and let's be honest,
[3649.46 → 3650.16] it hasn't been
[3650.16 → 3651.00] this way for a while,
[3651.84 → 3652.76] especially in Europe
[3652.76 → 3653.64] and increasingly
[3653.64 → 3654.22] in Canada,
[3654.78 → 3655.88] can you say
[3655.88 → 3657.24] the Bible says so,
[3658.16 → 3659.18] so go and do it?
[3660.40 → 3661.14] Or the Bible
[3661.14 → 3662.16] doesn't say so,
[3662.50 → 3663.30] so don't do it.
[3665.20 → 3666.18] For instance,
[3667.04 → 3667.88] the Bible
[3667.88 → 3668.78] has a really
[3668.78 → 3670.22] high bar
[3670.22 → 3671.98] for sexual ethics,
[3671.98 → 3672.90] for single people
[3672.90 → 3673.74] and for married
[3673.74 → 3674.48] people alike.
[3675.26 → 3676.52] And that high bar
[3676.52 → 3677.30] isn't given
[3677.30 → 3678.26] to prevent
[3678.26 → 3679.60] you're flourishing
[3679.60 → 3680.34] or to steal
[3680.34 → 3680.98] your joy,
[3681.26 → 3682.48] that high bar
[3682.48 → 3683.58] is actually given
[3683.58 → 3684.78] to increase
[3684.78 → 3685.76] your joy,
[3685.92 → 3686.96] to increase
[3686.96 → 3687.86] your opportunity
[3687.86 → 3688.66] for flourishing,
[3688.80 → 3690.62] for being a human being
[3690.62 → 3692.00] fully alive.
[3692.48 → 3694.18] Because that high bar
[3694.18 → 3695.78] reflects God's design
[3695.78 → 3696.60] and his intent
[3696.60 → 3698.24] for our life.
[3699.86 → 3701.08] There's a third century
[3701.08 → 3702.16] church father
[3702.16 → 3703.10] named Aaron News.
[3703.22 → 3703.80] He says that
[3703.80 → 3705.26] the glory of God
[3705.26 → 3706.54] is the human being
[3706.54 → 3707.50] fully alive.
[3708.44 → 3709.02] And so,
[3709.18 → 3710.12] as human beings
[3710.12 → 3711.60] pursuing the glory
[3711.60 → 3711.94] of God,
[3712.02 → 3713.42] that's where we find
[3713.42 → 3714.98] our joy.
[3715.08 → 3715.88] That's where we find
[3715.88 → 3716.34] what it means
[3716.34 → 3717.46] to be fully human,
[3718.00 → 3718.70] fully alive.
[3719.86 → 3721.24] But in our churches
[3721.24 → 3723.50] and maybe
[3723.50 → 3725.20] in our homes,
[3725.20 → 3726.88] we've got such
[3726.88 → 3727.74] a hard time
[3727.74 → 3728.46] talking about
[3728.46 → 3730.06] sex and sexuality
[3730.06 → 3731.28] for single people
[3731.28 → 3732.66] and for married people.
[3733.56 → 3734.42] And when it comes
[3734.42 → 3735.44] to practice,
[3735.70 → 3736.82] many of us prove
[3736.82 → 3737.38] that we don't
[3737.38 → 3738.28] really believe
[3738.28 → 3739.74] what we read
[3739.74 → 3740.62] or what maybe
[3740.62 → 3741.60] the pastor says
[3741.60 → 3742.46] on Sunday.
[3742.56 → 3743.44] We don't really believe
[3743.44 → 3744.60] what the Bible says
[3744.60 → 3745.60] about sexual ethics
[3745.60 → 3747.00] as for our flourishing
[3747.00 → 3748.14] and for our joy.
[3748.54 → 3748.90] Instead,
[3749.30 → 3749.96] we default
[3749.96 → 3750.94] to our own ideas.
[3752.66 → 3753.04] Right at Root,
[3753.04 → 3753.74] we think we've got
[3753.74 → 3754.96] a better plan.
[3755.14 → 3756.16] We've got it figured out.
[3757.42 → 3758.22] And this happens
[3758.22 → 3759.04] over and over again.
[3759.14 → 3759.26] Right?
[3759.26 → 3760.30] We have the same idea
[3760.30 → 3761.20] around abortion
[3761.20 → 3762.70] or end-of-life issues
[3762.70 → 3763.86] about medical assistance
[3763.86 → 3764.38] and dying
[3764.38 → 3765.62] or drug use
[3765.62 → 3766.90] and safe injection sites.
[3767.08 → 3768.18] And I want to be
[3768.18 → 3768.80] really clear.
[3769.52 → 3770.30] I'm not trying to say
[3770.30 → 3771.10] that any of these
[3771.10 → 3772.30] are simple issues
[3772.30 → 3773.38] and that if we
[3773.38 → 3774.62] just read the Bible,
[3774.78 → 3775.26] all Christians
[3775.26 → 3776.20] would agree on them.
[3777.46 → 3778.28] I'm simply making
[3778.28 → 3778.78] the point
[3778.78 → 3780.10] that you can
[3780.10 → 3781.48] no longer assume
[3781.48 → 3782.18] a position
[3782.18 → 3783.18] is valid
[3783.18 → 3784.70] because it happens
[3784.70 → 3786.18] to be the Christian position.
[3787.34 → 3788.54] Once that was true,
[3789.90 → 3790.94] that is no longer true.
[3792.02 → 3792.72] In fact,
[3792.80 → 3794.12] if you try to do that,
[3794.16 → 3794.88] you'll likely get
[3794.88 → 3795.66] more opposition
[3795.66 → 3797.32] in the public sphere.
[3798.26 → 3799.26] And this is new.
[3799.84 → 3800.70] This is unknown
[3800.70 → 3802.26] and an unprecedented
[3802.26 → 3803.02] landscape
[3803.02 → 3804.16] for us as the church.
[3804.28 → 3805.40] We are off the map.
[3806.60 → 3807.04] And so,
[3807.12 → 3808.18] we've got to ask ourselves,
[3808.60 → 3809.54] what does it mean
[3809.54 → 3810.40] to be disciples
[3810.40 → 3811.38] of Jesus?
[3811.38 → 3811.98] What does it mean
[3811.98 → 3812.96] to be the church,
[3812.96 → 3814.62] to do church,
[3815.62 → 3816.80] when like Abraham,
[3817.08 → 3817.64] we are called
[3817.64 → 3818.40] into a land
[3818.40 → 3819.26] we know not of?
[3821.60 → 3821.92] Now,
[3822.28 → 3823.12] don't hear what
[3823.12 → 3823.64] I'm not saying,
[3823.72 → 3823.86] right?
[3823.90 → 3824.50] Because in the midst
[3824.50 → 3825.14] of all of this,
[3825.24 → 3826.44] I am not challenging
[3826.44 → 3828.06] the sovereignty of God.
[3828.16 → 3829.14] I am not questioning
[3829.14 → 3830.32] the authority
[3830.32 → 3831.44] or the value
[3831.44 → 3832.14] of the Bible
[3832.14 → 3833.56] or the exclusivity
[3833.56 → 3834.96] of Jesus' atonement,
[3835.34 → 3835.58] right?
[3835.68 → 3836.28] In fact,
[3836.40 → 3837.42] what I'm confident of,
[3837.46 → 3838.14] the answer to
[3838.14 → 3839.02] how we do this
[3839.02 → 3841.22] is not by compromising
[3841.22 → 3842.18] or becoming
[3842.18 → 3842.70] quote-unquote
[3842.70 → 3843.22] progressive.
[3844.58 → 3844.94] In fact,
[3845.00 → 3845.60] I'm counting
[3845.60 → 3846.62] on those old,
[3846.68 → 3847.54] old truths
[3847.54 → 3848.32] to be true,
[3848.44 → 3849.36] those orthodox
[3849.36 → 3850.52] statements of faith
[3850.52 → 3851.14] to be true
[3851.14 → 3852.52] in order for us
[3852.52 → 3853.68] to step confidently
[3853.68 → 3856.02] into this unknown future.
[3856.56 → 3857.32] But the context
[3857.32 → 3858.00] we face
[3858.00 → 3859.26] is different,
[3859.88 → 3860.10] right?
[3860.12 → 3861.46] And how we live
[3861.46 → 3861.98] and present
[3861.98 → 3862.50] and preach
[3862.50 → 3862.90] and teach
[3862.90 → 3863.50] and practice
[3863.50 → 3864.28] these truths
[3864.28 → 3865.90] will be different.
[3865.90 → 3867.28] Now,
[3867.32 → 3868.10] I know some of you
[3868.10 → 3868.86] are hearing this
[3868.86 → 3869.46] and you're thinking,
[3869.84 → 3869.96] well,
[3870.04 → 3870.20] you know,
[3870.26 → 3870.72] it's probably
[3870.72 → 3871.60] not that different
[3871.60 → 3872.60] as he's making
[3872.60 → 3873.26] it out to be.
[3874.30 → 3874.76] And I'm going
[3874.76 → 3875.38] to be honest,
[3876.06 → 3877.28] for a certain
[3877.28 → 3879.42] generation of you
[3879.42 → 3880.90] living here
[3880.90 → 3881.54] in Langley,
[3882.34 → 3883.30] the Bible belt
[3883.30 → 3884.78] of British Columbia,
[3885.24 → 3886.40] it still feels
[3886.40 → 3887.14] pretty safe.
[3888.12 → 3888.94] It still feels
[3888.94 → 3889.62] pretty easy.
[3891.78 → 3892.56] But if you're
[3892.56 → 3893.28] in your 20s,
[3893.28 → 3895.30] you don't feel
[3895.30 → 3896.04] that same thing.
[3897.52 → 3897.92] If you're
[3897.92 → 3898.88] in your 30s,
[3899.56 → 3900.08] you're going,
[3900.20 → 3900.40] yeah,
[3900.56 → 3901.72] that's not
[3901.72 → 3902.38] really comfortable
[3902.38 → 3904.36] for me anymore.
[3906.28 → 3907.08] And so,
[3907.94 → 3908.74] in this
[3908.74 → 3909.40] uncharted
[3909.40 → 3910.60] territory,
[3910.88 → 3912.64] and if you
[3912.64 → 3913.92] are confident
[3913.92 → 3914.80] and secure,
[3915.44 → 3916.72] please help
[3916.72 → 3917.64] those of us
[3917.64 → 3918.56] who aren't
[3918.56 → 3919.72] or those of us
[3919.72 → 3920.30] who are facing
[3920.30 → 3920.94] these struggles
[3920.94 → 3921.64] every day
[3921.64 → 3922.72] in our lives.
[3922.72 → 3923.26] we've got to
[3923.26 → 3924.10] ask these questions.
[3924.24 → 3924.68] What does it mean
[3924.68 → 3925.42] for us to be
[3925.42 → 3926.28] off the map
[3926.28 → 3926.86] and how do we
[3926.86 → 3927.84] equip ourselves
[3927.84 → 3928.92] for it?
[3929.18 → 3929.66] How do we
[3929.66 → 3930.66] step into
[3930.66 → 3931.74] this unknown
[3931.74 → 3933.16] and let God's
[3933.16 → 3933.64] promises
[3933.64 → 3935.04] equip us?
[3936.28 → 3936.88] Because that's
[3936.88 → 3937.62] what Abraham did
[3937.62 → 3938.14] and we're looking
[3938.14 → 3938.68] to him as our
[3938.68 → 3939.84] model, right?
[3939.98 → 3940.60] God said,
[3940.84 → 3941.62] go to the land
[3941.62 → 3942.84] and Abraham
[3942.84 → 3943.18] was like,
[3943.24 → 3943.48] where?
[3943.74 → 3944.28] What land?
[3945.36 → 3945.84] And God said,
[3945.90 → 3946.64] go to the land,
[3946.76 → 3947.88] I will show you.
[3949.60 → 3949.82] Right?
[3949.82 → 3950.34] In verse 1,
[3950.40 → 3950.82] he says that.
[3951.50 → 3952.32] Go to the
[3952.34 → 3953.28] verse 1 of
[3953.28 → 3954.44] the Genesis 12
[3954.44 → 3955.14] text,
[3955.22 → 3955.48] he says,
[3955.82 → 3956.46] go to the land,
[3956.56 → 3957.84] I will show you.
[3957.90 → 3958.58] It's a promise
[3958.58 → 3959.70] and Abraham
[3959.70 → 3960.66] has to step
[3960.66 → 3961.34] forward
[3961.34 → 3962.48] before it's
[3962.48 → 3963.68] even visually
[3963.68 → 3964.66] available to him.
[3964.78 → 3965.54] Before it's
[3965.54 → 3966.54] even real,
[3966.66 → 3967.48] he has to step
[3967.48 → 3968.38] into it.
[3969.08 → 3969.48] And that's the
[3969.48 → 3970.08] very faith
[3970.08 → 3970.84] that Hebrews
[3970.84 → 3971.78] then holds
[3971.78 → 3973.12] Abraham up for
[3973.12 → 3974.02] as an example
[3974.02 → 3974.54] for us.
[3974.92 → 3975.46] In verse 8,
[3976.18 → 3977.08] Norah read for us,
[3977.08 → 3977.94] by faith,
[3978.10 → 3978.46] Abraham,
[3978.70 → 3979.08] when called
[3979.08 → 3980.04] to go to a place
[3980.04 → 3980.54] he would later
[3980.54 → 3981.36] receive as his
[3981.36 → 3981.84] inheritance,
[3982.50 → 3983.48] obeyed and went,
[3983.86 → 3984.66] even though he
[3984.66 → 3985.58] did not know
[3985.58 → 3986.72] where he was
[3986.72 → 3987.06] going.
[3988.70 → 3989.60] And he went
[3989.60 → 3991.50] and he made
[3991.50 → 3992.04] a home
[3992.04 → 3993.24] in that land.
[3994.40 → 3995.14] And even though
[3995.14 → 3995.72] he made a home
[3995.72 → 3995.98] there,
[3996.06 → 3997.28] he still lived,
[3997.36 → 3997.76] we read,
[3997.84 → 3998.56] as a stranger
[3998.56 → 4000.06] and as a
[4000.06 → 4000.46] foreigner
[4000.46 → 4001.42] or a forever
[4001.42 → 4002.04] foreigner.
[4003.40 → 4004.16] And then if you
[4004.16 → 4005.02] know Abraham's
[4005.02 → 4005.48] story,
[4005.64 → 4006.54] the same pattern
[4006.54 → 4007.60] continues.
[4008.56 → 4008.82] Right?
[4008.90 → 4009.54] He's go to a
[4009.54 → 4009.80] land.
[4009.92 → 4010.16] Where?
[4010.32 → 4010.80] What land?
[4011.10 → 4011.94] I'll show you.
[4012.42 → 4012.56] Right?
[4012.60 → 4012.86] He says,
[4013.00 → 4014.12] you will have
[4014.12 → 4014.56] a son.
[4015.24 → 4015.60] When?
[4016.14 → 4016.74] God says,
[4016.80 → 4017.16] effectively,
[4017.38 → 4017.94] I'll tell you
[4017.94 → 4018.22] later.
[4018.68 → 4019.14] Right now,
[4019.22 → 4019.66] just wait.
[4020.98 → 4021.46] And then when
[4021.46 → 4022.12] he does finally
[4022.12 → 4022.76] have a son,
[4022.94 → 4023.32] Isaac,
[4023.82 → 4024.38] God says,
[4024.48 → 4024.94] take him up
[4024.94 → 4025.36] a mountain.
[4026.42 → 4026.78] Abraham's like,
[4026.84 → 4027.08] why?
[4028.94 → 4029.50] And God says,
[4029.52 → 4029.84] you'll see
[4029.84 → 4030.26] when you get
[4030.26 → 4030.54] there.
[4031.90 → 4032.60] The Christian
[4032.60 → 4034.00] life is one
[4034.00 → 4034.64] of following
[4034.64 → 4035.48] after God's
[4035.48 → 4036.48] leading when
[4036.48 → 4037.26] you don't know
[4037.26 → 4037.74] where it's
[4037.74 → 4038.30] going to take
[4038.30 → 4039.10] you or when
[4039.10 → 4039.64] you don't know
[4039.64 → 4040.04] how you're
[4040.04 → 4040.36] going to get
[4040.36 → 4040.64] there.
[4041.12 → 4041.72] The Christian
[4041.72 → 4042.46] life is one
[4042.46 → 4042.88] that takes
[4042.88 → 4043.48] the promises
[4043.48 → 4044.20] of God
[4044.20 → 4045.18] and then tests
[4045.18 → 4046.16] them in the
[4046.16 → 4046.84] unknown of
[4046.84 → 4047.38] what is ahead.
[4048.16 → 4048.82] That's what
[4048.82 → 4049.56] Abraham had
[4049.56 → 4050.16] to do and
[4050.16 → 4050.64] that's what
[4050.64 → 4051.44] our churches
[4051.44 → 4051.88] are being
[4051.88 → 4052.34] called to
[4052.34 → 4053.24] do now.
[4054.22 → 4054.90] And this
[4054.90 → 4055.34] is what
[4055.34 → 4056.02] that faith
[4056.02 → 4057.10] looks like.
[4057.34 → 4057.44] Right?
[4057.52 → 4058.28] Stepping out
[4058.28 → 4058.90] of our
[4058.90 → 4060.20] known zones,
[4060.32 → 4060.76] out of our
[4060.76 → 4061.64] comfort zones,
[4061.86 → 4062.54] into the
[4062.54 → 4062.92] unknown,
[4063.26 → 4063.72] into the
[4063.72 → 4064.24] uncomfortable.
[4064.24 → 4066.38] It's not
[4066.38 → 4067.06] faith to
[4067.06 → 4067.52] do what
[4067.52 → 4068.12] you already
[4068.12 → 4068.54] know.
[4069.02 → 4069.56] It doesn't
[4069.56 → 4070.10] take faith
[4070.10 → 4070.72] to do what
[4070.72 → 4071.26] you're already
[4071.26 → 4071.82] able to
[4071.82 → 4072.10] do.
[4072.76 → 4073.44] It takes
[4073.44 → 4074.00] faith to
[4074.00 → 4074.22] say,
[4074.62 → 4074.98] Lord, I
[4074.98 → 4075.30] don't know
[4075.30 → 4075.58] how to
[4075.58 → 4076.12] do this.
[4076.72 → 4077.30] It takes
[4077.30 → 4077.76] faith to
[4077.76 → 4078.10] say, God,
[4078.14 → 4078.38] I don't
[4078.38 → 4078.76] know where
[4078.76 → 4079.34] we're going,
[4080.34 → 4081.20] but I'm
[4081.20 → 4081.62] faithfully
[4081.62 → 4083.30] following in
[4083.30 → 4083.68] obedience.
[4084.26 → 4084.90] It takes
[4084.90 → 4085.46] faith to
[4085.46 → 4086.52] say, we
[4086.52 → 4086.98] don't have
[4086.98 → 4087.66] a map for
[4087.66 → 4088.04] this.
[4089.42 → 4089.68] And so,
[4089.76 → 4090.16] God, do
[4090.16 → 4091.24] something in
[4091.24 → 4092.50] our midst and
[4092.50 → 4093.08] show us a
[4093.08 → 4093.64] way forward.
[4095.24 → 4095.82] The question
[4095.82 → 4096.52] isn't what
[4096.52 → 4097.14] are we going
[4097.14 → 4098.00] to do or
[4098.00 → 4098.58] where are we
[4098.58 → 4099.10] going because
[4099.10 → 4100.10] God has an
[4100.10 → 4100.96] emerging future
[4100.96 → 4101.84] for us and
[4101.84 → 4102.54] for you and
[4102.54 → 4103.70] for your life and
[4103.70 → 4104.28] for all of our
[4104.28 → 4104.58] churches.
[4104.72 → 4105.70] And he knows
[4105.70 → 4107.72] it, but he
[4107.72 → 4109.12] says, I
[4109.12 → 4109.52] will show
[4109.52 → 4109.78] you.
[4111.22 → 4111.62] And so,
[4111.68 → 4111.96] you've got to
[4111.96 → 4112.24] step.
[4114.00 → 4114.62] So, our
[4114.62 → 4115.26] question really
[4115.26 → 4116.28] is how are we
[4116.28 → 4117.34] going to step?
[4118.42 → 4118.76] Right?
[4118.80 → 4119.12] With what
[4119.12 → 4119.86] attitude and
[4119.86 → 4120.28] with what
[4120.28 → 4120.92] faith?
[4122.26 → 4122.74] I want you
[4122.74 → 4123.04] to notice
[4123.04 → 4123.62] something about
[4123.62 → 4125.08] Abraham's story,
[4125.16 → 4125.78] about how he
[4125.78 → 4126.38] could step
[4126.38 → 4126.72] out.
[4126.82 → 4127.28] Notice what
[4127.28 → 4128.36] God says to
[4128.36 → 4128.48] him.
[4128.56 → 4129.16] God promises
[4129.16 → 4129.70] him that he
[4129.70 → 4130.08] will be a
[4130.08 → 4130.72] great nation
[4130.72 → 4131.70] and that from
[4131.70 → 4133.06] him all of
[4133.06 → 4133.80] God's chosen
[4133.80 → 4134.72] people would
[4134.72 → 4135.36] come, that
[4135.36 → 4136.04] this nation
[4136.04 → 4136.68] would bless
[4136.68 → 4137.68] every nation.
[4139.40 → 4140.32] But where
[4140.32 → 4141.18] does that
[4141.18 → 4143.36] promise start?
[4143.54 → 4143.92] Where does
[4143.92 → 4144.66] that blessing
[4144.66 → 4145.60] every nation
[4145.60 → 4146.48] start?
[4148.48 → 4149.20] Starts with
[4149.20 → 4149.60] the sun.
[4149.60 → 4152.76] God told
[4152.76 → 4154.32] Abraham that
[4154.32 → 4155.50] his wife,
[4155.86 → 4156.64] Sarah, then
[4156.64 → 4157.54] called Sarai,
[4157.68 → 4158.16] would have a
[4158.16 → 4158.42] son.
[4159.62 → 4160.34] She is
[4160.34 → 4161.20] barren and
[4161.20 → 4162.30] Abraham is
[4162.30 → 4162.80] old.
[4169.14 → 4170.36] So old
[4170.36 → 4171.58] that our
[4171.58 → 4172.48] text says
[4172.48 → 4173.60] that,
[4173.60 → 4185.72] God says,
[4186.14 → 4188.14] look to the
[4188.14 → 4188.40] sun.
[4189.84 → 4190.50] Look to the
[4190.50 → 4191.24] promise of a
[4191.24 → 4191.94] sun as a
[4191.94 → 4193.22] guarantee of
[4193.22 → 4193.84] the world
[4193.84 → 4195.46] blessing father
[4195.46 → 4196.04] of many
[4196.04 → 4196.52] nations.
[4196.90 → 4197.40] Look to the
[4197.40 → 4197.68] sun.
[4199.06 → 4199.74] And underlying
[4199.74 → 4200.96] God's radical
[4200.96 → 4202.26] call to Abraham
[4202.26 → 4203.62] to step out
[4203.62 → 4204.48] in uncomfortable
[4204.48 → 4205.52] faith into
[4205.52 → 4206.14] the unknown
[4206.14 → 4206.74] is this
[4206.74 → 4207.54] banner,
[4207.90 → 4208.48] look to the
[4208.48 → 4208.76] sun.
[4210.40 → 4211.02] And then
[4211.02 → 4212.66] Isaac points
[4212.66 → 4213.68] us to the
[4213.68 → 4214.42] sun, the
[4214.42 → 4214.86] true and
[4214.86 → 4216.02] better sun,
[4217.22 → 4217.66] the sun we
[4217.66 → 4218.04] know to be
[4218.04 → 4218.36] Jesus.
[4220.30 → 4221.18] And Jesus
[4221.18 → 4221.72] follows the
[4221.72 → 4222.32] same pattern.
[4223.16 → 4223.82] He left
[4223.82 → 4225.14] his family,
[4225.34 → 4226.46] his eternal
[4226.46 → 4227.64] life-giving,
[4227.84 → 4228.86] love-living,
[4229.04 → 4229.90] trinity-dancing,
[4230.08 → 4230.46] fellowship,
[4230.90 → 4231.46] family,
[4231.46 → 4232.00] father,
[4232.20 → 4232.46] son,
[4232.54 → 4232.86] and holy
[4232.86 → 4233.16] spirit.
[4233.22 → 4234.02] He gave
[4234.02 → 4234.42] that up.
[4234.50 → 4235.08] He emptied
[4235.08 → 4235.76] himself of
[4235.76 → 4235.92] that.
[4236.00 → 4236.68] He left
[4236.68 → 4237.32] the comfort
[4237.32 → 4237.86] and the
[4237.86 → 4238.56] security of
[4238.56 → 4239.16] heaven and
[4239.16 → 4239.92] he exchanged
[4239.92 → 4240.54] that for a
[4240.54 → 4241.26] world that
[4241.26 → 4241.74] did not
[4241.74 → 4242.48] recognize him.
[4243.32 → 4243.84] He came to
[4243.84 → 4244.22] his own,
[4244.28 → 4244.70] but his own
[4244.70 → 4245.18] didn't see
[4245.18 → 4245.42] him,
[4245.78 → 4246.62] though it
[4246.62 → 4247.28] was created
[4247.28 → 4247.96] by him.
[4249.08 → 4249.80] The creator
[4249.80 → 4251.20] Jesus condescended
[4251.20 → 4252.62] such that he
[4252.62 → 4253.42] had to learn
[4253.42 → 4254.66] obedience and
[4254.66 → 4255.34] that obedience
[4255.34 → 4256.26] learned took
[4256.26 → 4257.12] him to death,
[4257.40 → 4258.42] even death on
[4258.42 → 4258.98] a cursed
[4258.98 → 4259.88] cross.
[4259.88 → 4259.96] cross.
[4261.00 → 4261.56] And in his
[4261.56 → 4261.88] death,
[4262.00 → 4262.88] he descended
[4262.88 → 4264.26] into hell.
[4266.08 → 4266.48] You think
[4266.48 → 4267.24] Abraham had to
[4267.24 → 4267.62] leave his
[4267.62 → 4268.36] father behind?
[4269.32 → 4270.02] Jesus was
[4270.02 → 4271.10] forsaken by
[4271.10 → 4271.62] his father.
[4272.00 → 4272.38] You think
[4272.38 → 4273.26] Abraham had to
[4273.26 → 4273.94] go into a
[4273.94 → 4274.54] land he knew
[4274.54 → 4275.10] not of?
[4275.22 → 4275.78] Jesus went
[4275.78 → 4276.12] into the
[4276.12 → 4276.58] abyss.
[4277.54 → 4278.04] In the
[4278.04 → 4278.38] garden,
[4278.64 → 4279.30] Jesus prayed,
[4279.50 → 4279.70] Father,
[4279.92 → 4280.58] if it is at
[4280.58 → 4281.26] all possible,
[4281.46 → 4282.26] remove this
[4282.26 → 4283.08] cup from
[4283.08 → 4283.32] me.
[4284.32 → 4284.86] And in
[4284.86 → 4285.58] Job and in
[4285.58 → 4286.22] Isaiah and
[4286.22 → 4286.74] in Jeremiah,
[4287.10 → 4287.70] you can see
[4287.70 → 4288.08] that the
[4288.08 → 4288.94] cup that
[4288.94 → 4289.24] he is
[4289.24 → 4290.12] referring to
[4290.12 → 4290.80] there is
[4290.80 → 4291.66] the cup of
[4291.66 → 4292.48] God's wrath
[4292.48 → 4293.24] against the
[4293.24 → 4294.50] sin of all
[4294.50 → 4295.38] people, the
[4295.38 → 4296.00] sins of the
[4296.00 → 4296.44] nations.
[4296.94 → 4298.34] Jesus bears
[4298.34 → 4298.70] it.
[4300.66 → 4301.36] When God
[4301.36 → 4301.94] calls you
[4301.94 → 4302.50] then to a
[4302.50 → 4303.20] new place,
[4303.54 → 4304.06] to a land
[4304.06 → 4304.34] you know
[4304.34 → 4304.74] not of,
[4304.78 → 4305.04] when God
[4305.04 → 4305.60] calls you
[4305.60 → 4306.08] off of the
[4306.08 → 4306.76] map, he
[4306.76 → 4307.18] says,
[4307.70 → 4307.92] look to
[4307.92 → 4308.44] the sun.
[4310.58 → 4311.30] And here's
[4311.30 → 4311.74] the thing,
[4311.90 → 4312.02] right?
[4312.58 → 4313.24] Right when
[4313.24 → 4313.92] you look to
[4313.92 → 4314.50] the sun,
[4315.86 → 4316.38] right when
[4316.38 → 4316.86] you look to
[4316.86 → 4319.32] Jesus, especially
[4319.32 → 4320.52] in this off
[4320.52 → 4321.02] the map
[4321.02 → 4321.62] increasingly
[4321.62 → 4322.30] post-Christian
[4322.30 → 4323.36] world, you
[4323.36 → 4324.48] will look just
[4324.48 → 4326.52] like Abraham, a
[4326.52 → 4327.48] forever foreigner
[4327.48 → 4329.04] in the land he
[4329.04 → 4329.46] went into.
[4331.02 → 4331.56] And because,
[4331.70 → 4332.28] like Abraham,
[4332.46 → 4333.20] notice in
[4333.20 → 4333.90] verse 10 we
[4333.90 → 4334.32] can read,
[4335.54 → 4336.26] he was looking
[4336.26 → 4337.02] for a city
[4337.02 → 4338.08] without foundations
[4338.08 → 4338.96] whose architect
[4338.96 → 4340.60] was God.
[4341.26 → 4341.74] And he was
[4341.74 → 4342.60] looking beyond
[4342.60 → 4343.86] this world
[4343.86 → 4345.12] for fulfillment.
[4345.28 → 4345.66] He was looking
[4345.66 → 4346.30] beyond this
[4346.30 → 4347.60] life for
[4347.60 → 4348.46] purpose.
[4349.26 → 4349.68] And then,
[4350.06 → 4350.84] the writer of
[4350.84 → 4351.54] Hebrews, it
[4351.54 → 4352.74] seems, takes a
[4352.74 → 4353.30] little bit of a
[4353.30 → 4354.00] break in his
[4354.00 → 4355.00] storytelling of
[4355.00 → 4356.68] Abraham to
[4356.68 → 4357.32] make a point
[4357.32 → 4358.16] about all these
[4358.16 → 4358.96] faith heroes.
[4359.50 → 4359.64] Right?
[4359.70 → 4360.12] We read,
[4360.94 → 4361.84] all these people
[4361.84 → 4362.76] were still living
[4362.76 → 4363.52] by faith when
[4363.52 → 4364.02] they died.
[4364.16 → 4364.64] They did not
[4364.64 → 4365.32] receive the
[4365.32 → 4366.58] things promised.
[4366.84 → 4367.66] They only saw
[4367.66 → 4368.52] them and welcomed
[4368.52 → 4369.16] them from a
[4369.16 → 4370.50] distance, admitting
[4370.50 → 4371.06] that they were
[4371.06 → 4371.80] foreigners and
[4371.80 → 4372.44] strangers on
[4372.44 → 4372.70] earth.
[4373.28 → 4373.80] And people who
[4373.80 → 4374.56] say such things
[4374.56 → 4375.20] show that they
[4375.20 → 4375.86] are looking for
[4375.86 → 4376.78] a country of
[4376.78 → 4377.36] their own.
[4378.02 → 4378.66] If they had
[4378.66 → 4379.06] been thinking
[4379.06 → 4379.52] of the country
[4379.52 → 4380.18] they had left,
[4380.26 → 4380.64] they would have
[4380.64 → 4380.90] had the
[4380.90 → 4381.54] opportunity to
[4381.54 → 4381.88] return.
[4382.02 → 4383.54] Instead, they
[4383.54 → 4384.40] were longing
[4384.40 → 4385.64] for a better
[4385.64 → 4387.74] country, a
[4387.74 → 4388.48] heavenly one.
[4390.58 → 4390.76] Right?
[4390.80 → 4391.46] Like Abraham,
[4392.32 → 4393.16] like all of
[4393.16 → 4394.10] these faith heroes,
[4394.40 → 4395.56] we fix our
[4395.56 → 4396.98] eyes on Jesus
[4396.98 → 4398.16] and through
[4398.16 → 4398.96] fixing our
[4398.96 → 4399.82] eyes on him,
[4399.82 → 4400.90] we fix them
[4400.90 → 4401.64] on a future
[4401.64 → 4403.30] secured, a future
[4403.30 → 4404.14] of heaven and
[4404.14 → 4405.06] earth made
[4405.06 → 4406.38] as one, made
[4406.38 → 4407.86] into one, a
[4407.86 → 4408.38] future where
[4408.38 → 4409.00] God's dwelling
[4409.00 → 4409.98] place is now
[4409.98 → 4412.02] with us here, a
[4412.02 → 4412.94] future looking to
[4412.94 → 4413.96] the return and
[4413.96 → 4414.60] the resurrection
[4414.60 → 4416.44] of all as
[4416.44 → 4417.46] Jesus comes
[4417.46 → 4418.12] back.
[4418.28 → 4419.02] Jesus Christ
[4419.02 → 4420.14] calls us
[4420.14 → 4421.76] forward in
[4421.76 → 4422.38] the present
[4422.38 → 4423.56] because of
[4423.56 → 4424.52] God's promise
[4424.52 → 4425.66] of that great
[4425.66 → 4426.46] and glorious
[4426.46 → 4427.08] day.
[4427.88 → 4428.48] And so,
[4428.76 → 4429.40] remember, the
[4429.40 → 4430.06] whole point of
[4430.06 → 4430.64] Hebrews 11,
[4430.74 → 4431.28] the whole point
[4431.28 → 4431.98] of this Faith
[4431.98 → 4433.42] Heroes series,
[4434.56 → 4435.66] right, is to
[4435.66 → 4437.02] the whole point
[4437.02 → 4438.00] of you and
[4438.00 → 4439.28] me telling our
[4439.28 → 4441.06] stories is to
[4441.06 → 4442.26] spur us
[4442.26 → 4442.96] forward to
[4442.96 → 4443.76] that great
[4443.76 → 4444.36] day.
[4445.16 → 4445.88] Hebrews 12
[4445.88 → 4447.04] says,
[4447.60 → 4447.98] therefore,
[4449.26 → 4449.96] and that means
[4449.96 → 4450.60] this is it,
[4450.68 → 4451.20] this is the
[4451.20 → 4451.76] point, we've
[4451.76 → 4452.32] told all of
[4452.32 → 4453.00] these stories,
[4453.48 → 4454.42] therefore, since
[4454.42 → 4455.24] we are surrounded
[4455.24 → 4456.12] by such a great
[4456.12 → 4456.92] cloud of witnesses,
[4457.18 → 4457.92] those are the
[4457.92 → 4459.20] stories, let us
[4459.20 → 4459.92] throw off
[4459.92 → 4460.96] everything that
[4460.96 → 4461.54] hinders and
[4461.54 → 4462.18] the sin that
[4462.18 → 4462.96] so easily
[4462.96 → 4463.98] entangles and
[4463.98 → 4464.56] let us run
[4464.56 → 4465.34] with perseverance
[4465.34 → 4466.28] the race marked
[4466.28 → 4466.90] out for us,
[4467.34 → 4468.50] fixing our eyes
[4468.50 → 4469.50] on Jesus, the
[4469.50 → 4470.42] pioneer and
[4470.42 → 4471.62] perfecter of
[4471.62 → 4472.30] our faith.
[4472.94 → 4473.86] For the joy
[4473.86 → 4475.14] set before him,
[4475.22 → 4476.30] he endured the
[4476.30 → 4477.78] cross, scorning
[4477.78 → 4478.90] its shame, and
[4478.90 → 4479.98] sat down at the
[4479.98 → 4480.90] right hand of
[4480.90 → 4482.26] the throne of
[4482.26 → 4482.62] God.
[4484.82 → 4485.44] You see,
[4485.50 → 4486.02] what's off the
[4486.02 → 4488.28] map to us is
[4488.28 → 4488.94] all one big
[4488.94 → 4489.68] picture to God.
[4493.42 → 4494.22] And so here's
[4494.22 → 4494.46] what we've
[4494.46 → 4494.66] seen.
[4496.18 → 4497.52] Abraham was
[4497.52 → 4498.44] sent to a
[4498.44 → 4499.44] land he knew
[4499.44 → 4500.36] not of and
[4500.36 → 4501.30] was not known
[4501.30 → 4502.52] in to be a
[4502.52 → 4503.62] blessing to the
[4503.62 → 4504.10] world, a
[4504.10 → 4504.74] blessing that
[4504.74 → 4505.96] started with
[4505.96 → 4506.32] the Son.
[4507.40 → 4508.06] And Jesus,
[4508.42 → 4509.02] the true and
[4509.02 → 4509.92] better Son,
[4510.00 → 4510.72] was sent into
[4510.72 → 4511.46] a land he
[4511.46 → 4512.52] knew of but
[4512.52 → 4513.34] was not known
[4513.34 → 4515.04] in to be a
[4515.04 → 4516.04] blessing to the
[4516.04 → 4516.32] world.
[4517.16 → 4517.90] And now we,
[4517.90 → 4518.60] as the
[4518.60 → 4519.18] spiritual
[4519.18 → 4520.22] brothers and
[4520.22 → 4520.84] sisters of
[4520.84 → 4521.34] Jesus and
[4521.34 → 4521.86] the spiritual
[4521.86 → 4522.54] sons and
[4522.54 → 4523.60] daughters, heirs
[4523.60 → 4524.50] of Abraham,
[4524.88 → 4525.92] we are sent
[4525.92 → 4527.08] into a land we
[4527.08 → 4528.64] know not of and
[4528.64 → 4529.66] we may no longer
[4529.66 → 4531.56] be known in to
[4531.56 → 4533.36] be a blessing to
[4533.36 → 4533.82] the world.
[4535.22 → 4536.14] And so let me
[4536.14 → 4537.98] end with this
[4537.98 → 4539.14] encouragement.
[4539.14 → 4542.46] the truth of
[4542.46 → 4543.80] the gospel is
[4543.80 → 4544.96] that at the
[4544.96 → 4545.92] name of Jesus
[4545.92 → 4547.18] every knee will
[4547.18 → 4548.38] bow and every
[4548.38 → 4549.54] tongue confess in
[4549.54 → 4551.12] heaven and on
[4551.12 → 4552.20] earth and under
[4552.20 → 4552.86] the earth that
[4552.86 → 4554.48] Jesus Christ is
[4554.48 → 4555.52] Lord to the
[4555.52 → 4556.42] glory of God
[4556.42 → 4557.20] the Father.
[4558.06 → 4559.26] That is
[4559.26 → 4560.92] true, that is
[4560.92 → 4561.84] promised, that
[4561.84 → 4562.92] is fixed.
[4563.16 → 4564.80] God will be
[4564.80 → 4565.82] glorified.
[4565.82 → 4569.08] God, the
[4569.08 → 4570.14] Son went
[4570.14 → 4571.70] out because it
[4571.70 → 4572.80] was his joy to
[4572.80 → 4573.42] save you.
[4574.14 → 4575.56] It was his joy to
[4575.56 → 4577.08] find you and he
[4577.08 → 4578.14] alone could do it.
[4578.38 → 4579.48] He alone did it
[4579.48 → 4581.78] and now you go
[4581.78 → 4584.26] out never alone.
[4585.02 → 4586.06] No matter how far
[4586.06 → 4587.42] off the map we are
[4587.42 → 4588.46] called to go,
[4588.92 → 4590.16] Jesus went further.
[4590.36 → 4591.30] No matter how far
[4591.30 → 4593.00] off the map we might
[4593.00 → 4594.32] find ourselves, he
[4594.32 → 4595.44] will never leave
[4595.44 → 4596.72] us nor forsake
[4596.72 → 4596.96] us.
[4597.20 → 4598.26] This is God's
[4598.26 → 4599.44] gospel promise.
[4599.60 → 4600.60] God will bless
[4600.60 → 4601.76] you for the
[4601.76 → 4602.04] journey.
[4602.12 → 4602.88] That is, he will
[4602.88 → 4603.78] make you ready.
[4604.12 → 4605.24] He will equip
[4605.24 → 4605.56] you.
[4608.16 → 4609.32] He will turn
[4609.32 → 4610.80] our canoes
[4610.80 → 4611.96] into climbing
[4611.96 → 4612.30] here.
[4613.94 → 4614.40] And like
[4614.40 → 4614.96] Abraham,
[4616.02 → 4616.78] when God
[4616.78 → 4617.86] called you as
[4617.86 → 4619.02] a son or
[4619.02 → 4619.72] daughter, he
[4619.72 → 4620.84] gave you a
[4620.84 → 4622.06] new name.
[4622.06 → 4622.98] He gave you
[4622.98 → 4624.20] life from
[4624.20 → 4626.00] life and he
[4626.00 → 4626.76] gave you life
[4626.76 → 4628.20] from death
[4628.20 → 4629.54] and by his
[4629.54 → 4631.24] doing, you
[4631.24 → 4631.88] didn't deserve
[4631.88 → 4632.96] it, but he
[4632.96 → 4633.44] did it.
[4634.80 → 4635.62] And so now,
[4635.68 → 4636.62] life that we
[4636.62 → 4637.46] live in him
[4637.46 → 4638.24] and with him
[4638.24 → 4639.44] is lived on
[4639.44 → 4640.42] the front lines
[4640.42 → 4641.52] of obedience.
[4642.22 → 4642.82] He calls
[4642.82 → 4643.66] and we go.
[4644.30 → 4645.10] We walk by
[4645.10 → 4645.98] faith, not by
[4645.98 → 4646.34] sight.
[4646.96 → 4648.10] The faith that
[4648.10 → 4649.06] unites us to
[4649.06 → 4650.28] God sends us
[4650.28 → 4651.32] out with
[4651.32 → 4651.98] God.
[4652.24 → 4652.98] The faith that
[4652.98 → 4653.80] keeps us
[4653.80 → 4655.12] secure is
[4655.12 → 4655.90] the faith that
[4655.90 → 4656.74] calls us to
[4656.74 → 4657.40] give up our
[4657.40 → 4657.88] security.
[4658.60 → 4659.42] The faith that
[4659.42 → 4660.28] unites us to
[4660.28 → 4661.32] God who is our
[4661.32 → 4662.50] comfort calls
[4662.50 → 4663.38] us to the
[4663.38 → 4664.00] uncomfortable.
[4667.18 → 4668.08] We're called to
[4668.08 → 4668.92] go to a place
[4668.92 → 4669.84] we do not yet
[4669.84 → 4670.82] know.
[4671.76 → 4672.62] But will we
[4672.62 → 4673.56] listen?
[4673.56 → 4673.64] Listen.
[4673.64 → 4681.56] shortly after
[4681.56 → 4682.86] Rachel and I
[4682.86 → 4683.32] were married,
[4683.86 → 4685.46] we moved to
[4685.46 → 4686.54] Grand Rapids,
[4686.64 → 4686.90] Michigan
[4686.90 → 4689.74] because I was
[4689.74 → 4691.08] studying in
[4691.08 → 4691.86] seminary there.
[4692.54 → 4693.04] So we were
[4693.04 → 4693.60] married for
[4693.60 → 4694.82] just about a
[4694.82 → 4695.96] month and
[4695.96 → 4696.54] then we packed
[4696.54 → 4697.34] all of our
[4697.34 → 4698.80] possessions into
[4698.80 → 4699.46] the back of a
[4699.46 → 4699.92] little eight-foot
[4699.92 → 4700.22] trailer.
[4700.32 → 4700.78] We didn't have a
[4700.78 → 4702.18] lot and we
[4702.18 → 4702.44] went.
[4703.94 → 4704.56] And we
[4704.56 → 4705.16] studied together.
[4705.94 → 4707.02] I took Rachel
[4707.02 → 4708.10] from the comfort
[4708.10 → 4709.08] of her home and
[4709.08 → 4710.78] her family and
[4710.78 → 4712.10] brought her to a
[4712.10 → 4712.88] country that we
[4712.88 → 4713.74] didn't know, a
[4713.74 → 4714.52] city that we
[4714.52 → 4715.18] didn't live in,
[4715.28 → 4716.12] but we were
[4716.12 → 4717.64] trying to step
[4717.64 → 4718.38] forward in
[4718.38 → 4719.30] response to
[4719.30 → 4720.58] God's call on
[4720.58 → 4721.24] my life.
[4722.00 → 4722.56] She had to
[4722.56 → 4723.12] come along for
[4723.12 → 4723.52] the ride.
[4723.52 → 4726.86] fast-forward,
[4727.20 → 4727.78] because this is
[4727.78 → 4728.14] the point of
[4728.14 → 4728.56] the story,
[4728.88 → 4729.52] three years.
[4730.24 → 4730.78] I'm finishing
[4730.78 → 4731.78] up my
[4731.78 → 4732.60] seminary degree.
[4733.74 → 4734.74] I'm starting
[4734.74 → 4735.44] to think about
[4735.44 → 4736.08] where am I
[4736.08 → 4736.52] going to be
[4736.52 → 4737.22] called into
[4737.22 → 4737.88] ministry and
[4737.88 → 4738.66] into service and
[4738.66 → 4739.30] what's that going
[4739.30 → 4739.92] to look like.
[4740.02 → 4740.70] And in the
[4740.70 → 4741.30] Christian Reformed
[4741.30 → 4742.30] Church, when
[4742.30 → 4742.60] you're at
[4742.60 → 4743.34] Calvin Seminary
[4743.34 → 4744.02] in particular,
[4744.52 → 4744.96] which is our
[4744.96 → 4745.60] denominational
[4745.60 → 4747.22] school, in
[4747.22 → 4748.26] that last year,
[4748.52 → 4749.24] you kind of get
[4749.24 → 4750.44] a monthly update
[4750.44 → 4751.18] of all the
[4751.18 → 4751.90] churches that
[4751.90 → 4752.32] are without
[4752.32 → 4752.78] pastors.
[4753.52 → 4754.36] You get this
[4754.36 → 4754.92] list that's
[4754.92 → 4755.46] sort of emailed
[4755.46 → 4757.08] to you, and
[4757.08 → 4757.60] then you can
[4757.60 → 4758.88] do with that
[4758.88 → 4759.82] list what you
[4759.82 → 4759.98] will.
[4760.90 → 4761.66] Well, there
[4761.66 → 4762.00] was a few
[4762.00 → 4763.06] churches in
[4763.06 → 4764.52] Ontario that
[4764.52 → 4764.96] were on that
[4764.96 → 4765.34] list, and I
[4765.34 → 4765.68] thought, okay,
[4765.74 → 4766.22] I'll send them
[4766.22 → 4767.94] a letter, and
[4767.94 → 4768.92] then we'll see
[4768.92 → 4769.40] what happens.
[4772.40 → 4773.00] One of the
[4773.00 → 4773.50] churches that I
[4773.50 → 4774.00] ended up sending
[4774.00 → 4774.66] a letter to
[4774.66 → 4775.72] was Trinity
[4775.72 → 4776.70] CRC in
[4776.70 → 4776.88] St.
[4776.94 → 4777.30] Catharine's.
[4778.52 → 4778.94] Trinity
[4778.94 → 4779.88] emailed me
[4779.88 → 4780.78] back, and
[4780.78 → 4781.26] they said,
[4781.88 → 4782.80] sorry, we're
[4782.80 → 4783.22] not really
[4783.22 → 4783.98] looking for
[4783.98 → 4784.86] a student.
[4785.32 → 4786.00] The last two
[4786.00 → 4786.70] pastors we've
[4786.70 → 4787.66] had here had
[4787.66 → 4788.24] been students
[4788.24 → 4788.78] straight out of
[4788.78 → 4789.42] seminary, and
[4789.42 → 4790.06] we're not sure
[4790.06 → 4790.66] that's what we
[4790.66 → 4791.36] need right now.
[4792.22 → 4793.00] I said, okay,
[4793.10 → 4793.74] no problem,
[4794.24 → 4795.16] that's fine,
[4795.84 → 4796.42] thank you for
[4796.42 → 4796.98] getting back to
[4796.98 → 4797.50] me, and then
[4797.50 → 4798.04] the next email
[4798.04 → 4798.82] came, but we
[4798.82 → 4799.48] are looking for
[4799.48 → 4800.42] pulpit supply on
[4800.42 → 4801.28] May 15th if
[4801.28 → 4801.74] you're around.
[4803.24 → 4804.18] Okay, you
[4804.18 → 4804.94] could pay me to
[4804.94 → 4805.38] come out,
[4805.52 → 4805.96] absolutely.
[4808.04 → 4808.70] And so I
[4808.70 → 4809.20] told Rachel
[4809.20 → 4811.52] this, and
[4811.52 → 4812.10] as we were
[4812.10 → 4813.36] driving from
[4813.36 → 4814.92] Grand Rapids
[4814.92 → 4816.80] to St.
[4816.86 → 4818.14] Catharine's, she
[4818.14 → 4819.40] said, Chris,
[4820.24 → 4821.68] three years ago
[4821.68 → 4822.94] when we moved
[4822.94 → 4823.52] to Michigan,
[4824.24 → 4825.54] God told me
[4825.54 → 4826.72] that we are
[4826.72 → 4827.28] going to St.
[4827.34 → 4827.74] Catharine's.
[4829.74 → 4832.84] Now, if you
[4832.84 → 4833.66] know Rachel,
[4833.80 → 4834.98] my wife, you
[4834.98 → 4835.64] know that that's
[4835.64 → 4836.38] not her ordinary
[4836.38 → 4837.28] way of speaking
[4837.28 → 4838.02] about life and
[4838.02 → 4838.30] faith.
[4839.48 → 4840.16] And so when she
[4840.16 → 4840.78] says something
[4840.78 → 4842.56] like that, I
[4842.56 → 4844.22] listen, and I
[4844.22 → 4845.26] take that very
[4845.26 → 4845.98] seriously.
[4846.94 → 4847.66] And so we
[4847.66 → 4848.92] went, and I'm
[4848.92 → 4849.76] not sure of
[4849.76 → 4850.62] this church who
[4850.62 → 4851.26] doesn't want a
[4851.26 → 4852.04] student, and my
[4852.04 → 4852.66] wife who's like,
[4852.74 → 4853.74] nope, God said
[4853.74 → 4853.96] St.
[4854.02 → 4854.98] Catharine's, and
[4854.98 → 4855.62] there's no reason
[4855.62 → 4856.14] for that, let me
[4856.14 → 4856.62] be clear, we have
[4856.62 → 4857.42] no family, we
[4857.42 → 4858.36] have no history in
[4858.36 → 4858.52] St.
[4858.58 → 4859.16] Catharine's, no
[4859.16 → 4859.62] connection.
[4861.64 → 4862.66] I preach there,
[4863.28 → 4864.16] I lead worship
[4864.16 → 4864.72] there, I should
[4864.72 → 4866.36] say, and I
[4866.36 → 4867.16] and the chair of
[4867.16 → 4867.50] the search
[4867.50 → 4868.02] committee comes
[4868.02 → 4868.40] up to me
[4868.40 → 4868.96] afterwards, and
[4868.96 → 4871.92] they go, so, we
[4871.92 → 4872.66] weren't looking for
[4872.66 → 4874.06] a student, but
[4874.06 → 4874.70] maybe you're our
[4874.70 → 4875.10] student.
[4876.66 → 4878.34] Can we try again?
[4879.12 → 4880.74] Okay, anyway, they
[4880.74 → 4881.52] ended up calling me,
[4882.52 → 4883.04] right, and we
[4883.04 → 4883.92] ended up being
[4883.92 → 4884.12] there.
[4884.26 → 4884.74] Three years
[4884.74 → 4886.70] before, God
[4886.70 → 4887.48] laid it on Rachel's
[4887.48 → 4888.72] heart that we
[4888.72 → 4889.38] would go to this
[4889.38 → 4890.04] place we knew
[4890.04 → 4892.14] not of, and that
[4892.14 → 4892.62] we would serve
[4892.62 → 4892.88] there.
[4894.00 → 4894.64] Fast forward
[4894.64 → 4895.50] seven years,
[4896.36 → 4897.26] I've been there
[4897.26 → 4898.06] for seven years,
[4898.16 → 4899.10] which is about as
[4899.10 → 4900.24] long as first-time
[4900.24 → 4901.16] pastors are in
[4901.16 → 4901.96] their call, and so
[4901.96 → 4902.56] I'm starting to
[4902.56 → 4903.58] think, do we need
[4903.58 → 4904.14] to go somewhere
[4904.14 → 4904.46] else?
[4904.94 → 4905.78] Is it that time?
[4906.50 → 4907.36] But I didn't really
[4907.36 → 4908.28] feel like it was,
[4908.68 → 4908.88] right?
[4908.94 → 4909.78] Things were good at
[4909.78 → 4910.56] Trinity, the church
[4910.56 → 4911.48] was doing well,
[4911.84 → 4913.10] they still liked me
[4913.10 → 4914.16] there, it seemed,
[4914.28 → 4914.88] at least the ones
[4914.88 → 4915.62] who talked to me
[4915.62 → 4916.50] still liked me,
[4917.16 → 4918.88] and so we weren't
[4918.88 → 4920.78] rushing to get out,
[4921.48 → 4922.22] but I started
[4922.22 → 4923.72] wondering, maybe it's
[4923.72 → 4925.96] time, and Rachel
[4925.96 → 4927.52] said to me one
[4927.52 → 4929.72] day, Chris, I
[4929.72 → 4930.24] think God is
[4930.24 → 4931.84] telling me we're
[4931.84 → 4932.22] going to move
[4932.22 → 4932.62] west.
[4935.34 → 4936.34] And so based on
[4936.34 → 4937.20] my experience of
[4937.20 → 4938.00] Rachel hearing God
[4938.00 → 4938.76] speak to her like
[4938.76 → 4939.76] that, I took that
[4939.76 → 4941.12] very seriously, well
[4941.12 → 4941.62] here we are.
[4942.76 → 4943.70] Three years later,
[4944.14 → 4944.80] so God speaks,
[4945.06 → 4945.84] gives Rachel three
[4945.84 → 4946.90] years of warning
[4946.90 → 4948.00] before he makes a
[4948.00 → 4948.42] big change.
[4948.62 → 4949.20] That's what we've
[4949.20 → 4949.38] learned.
[4949.52 → 4950.38] Three years later,
[4950.38 → 4953.50] I think PIM or
[4953.50 → 4955.36] someone, PIM at the
[4955.36 → 4956.16] time or Leslie
[4956.16 → 4957.06] reached out to me
[4957.06 → 4958.76] and said, after I
[4958.76 → 4959.44] reached out to you,
[4959.70 → 4960.52] because Rachel found
[4960.52 → 4961.74] it is on the website
[4961.74 → 4962.74] and said, hey, go
[4962.74 → 4963.34] check this out.
[4965.78 → 4968.62] Rachel is a person
[4968.62 → 4969.56] in my life, and
[4969.56 → 4970.20] she's not here this
[4970.20 → 4971.32] morning, so I can
[4971.32 → 4971.98] get away with saying
[4971.98 → 4972.62] this without her
[4972.62 → 4973.24] being mad at me.
[4974.28 → 4975.10] Rachel is a person
[4975.10 → 4977.06] in my life who
[4977.06 → 4978.44] hears the call of
[4978.44 → 4979.40] God to go to a
[4979.40 → 4981.88] place and in
[4981.88 → 4983.64] obedience responds.
[4985.22 → 4986.32] She models that
[4986.32 → 4987.78] for me, and I
[4987.78 → 4988.76] listen, and I
[4988.76 → 4990.64] look to her, and I
[4990.64 → 4992.42] see God leading
[4992.42 → 4993.46] us and shaping
[4993.46 → 4995.00] our story through
[4995.00 → 4996.46] her faithful
[4996.46 → 4997.42] obedience to his
[4997.42 → 4997.72] call.
[5000.18 → 5001.48] The reason we
[5001.48 → 5002.70] tell stories like
[5002.70 → 5004.46] this is because
[5004.46 → 5005.24] we are off the
[5005.24 → 5005.54] map.
[5006.82 → 5007.74] We have not
[5007.74 → 5008.70] gotten or we
[5008.70 → 5009.72] have lost the
[5009.72 → 5011.20] ability to see
[5011.20 → 5012.42] God at work in
[5012.42 → 5013.48] the world today.
[5014.76 → 5016.08] These stories
[5016.08 → 5018.28] are our
[5018.28 → 5019.94] seeing God at
[5019.94 → 5021.10] work in the
[5021.10 → 5022.40] world, and so
[5022.40 → 5023.98] tell these
[5023.98 → 5024.82] stories.
[5025.38 → 5026.92] As you go into
[5026.92 → 5028.28] this week, tell
[5028.28 → 5029.58] someone about
[5029.58 → 5030.24] where you have
[5030.24 → 5030.96] seen God at
[5030.96 → 5031.24] work.
[5031.52 → 5032.98] As you go into
[5032.98 → 5034.16] this week, tell
[5034.16 → 5035.38] someone about the
[5035.38 → 5036.52] joy of knowing
[5036.52 → 5038.58] Jesus and see
[5038.58 → 5039.48] what God does in
[5039.48 → 5039.94] this moment.
[5040.28 → 5041.60] As you go into
[5041.60 → 5043.76] this week, cry
[5043.76 → 5044.42] out with
[5044.42 → 5045.88] someone, Lord, I
[5045.88 → 5047.34] need to see you
[5047.34 → 5049.24] more and more in
[5049.24 → 5049.80] my life.
[5050.52 → 5051.44] Share these
[5051.44 → 5052.06] stories.
[5052.12 → 5052.78] And that starts
[5052.78 → 5053.24] here.
[5053.86 → 5054.28] Absolutely.
[5054.44 → 5055.32] It starts after
[5055.32 → 5055.60] church.
[5055.66 → 5055.98] We're going to have
[5055.98 → 5056.54] coffee and
[5056.54 → 5056.90] fellowship.
[5057.76 → 5058.82] Don't just talk
[5058.82 → 5060.64] about how your
[5060.64 → 5061.40] tomatoes are doing
[5061.40 → 5063.24] this year, or your
[5063.24 → 5063.84] squash.
[5063.84 → 5064.60] I see some on
[5064.60 → 5065.00] the harvest
[5065.00 → 5065.40] table.
[5066.86 → 5067.84] Where is God?
[5068.84 → 5069.48] Where is he
[5069.48 → 5070.08] calling you?
[5071.02 → 5071.68] Where is he
[5071.68 → 5072.30] sending you?
[5072.96 → 5073.58] And how can we
[5073.58 → 5075.00] hear him and
[5075.00 → 5076.38] see him at
[5076.38 → 5076.66] work?
[5077.28 → 5078.72] As you go, as
[5078.72 → 5080.12] disciples and as
[5080.12 → 5081.68] a church, we are
[5081.68 → 5082.50] called out.
[5082.60 → 5083.40] We are called off
[5083.40 → 5083.72] the map.
[5083.80 → 5084.88] We are called into
[5084.88 → 5085.68] places we have
[5085.68 → 5086.74] never been before.
[5087.64 → 5088.60] And we may not
[5088.60 → 5091.28] have a map, but
[5091.28 → 5091.86] we have the word.
[5091.86 → 5093.94] And the word of
[5093.94 → 5095.26] God is living and
[5095.26 → 5096.00] active, and the
[5096.00 → 5096.72] word of God is
[5096.72 → 5098.12] eternally true.
[5098.34 → 5099.48] And when we look
[5099.48 → 5101.50] to the word, we
[5101.50 → 5102.98] see the sun.
[5105.22 → 5105.96] And when we see
[5105.96 → 5107.98] the sun, we see
[5107.98 → 5109.04] the one who gave
[5109.04 → 5110.70] up ultimate comfort
[5110.70 → 5113.00] so that we now
[5113.00 → 5114.02] might be called to
[5114.02 → 5115.18] give up our
[5115.18 → 5116.36] comforts.
[5117.22 → 5118.60] He did it for you,
[5118.72 → 5120.22] and now you get
[5120.22 → 5121.46] to do it for him.
[5121.86 → 5126.54] And that, that, my
[5126.54 → 5128.08] friends, my brothers
[5128.08 → 5129.62] and sisters, that, my
[5129.62 → 5130.96] fellow pilgrims on
[5130.96 → 5133.22] this journey, that is
[5133.22 → 5136.06] where true joy is
[5136.06 → 5136.96] found.
[5137.78 → 5138.06] Amen?
[5138.90 → 5140.18] Let's pray together.
[5140.18 → 5147.54] Holy God, as we go, we
[5147.54 → 5148.04] go with you.
[5149.30 → 5151.10] As you sent Abraham
[5151.10 → 5152.26] and called him, you
[5152.26 → 5154.76] send us and call us.
[5155.00 → 5156.78] And so open our eyes
[5156.78 → 5158.58] to see all the ways
[5158.58 → 5160.12] that you are at work
[5160.12 → 5160.70] in the world.
[5161.76 → 5163.06] We may be off the
[5163.06 → 5164.36] map, but we are in
[5164.36 → 5164.78] your care.
[5164.78 → 5166.76] And so as we go, may
[5166.76 → 5168.28] we know the love
[5168.28 → 5169.46] of Christ.
[5170.06 → 5171.14] Send us out now
[5171.14 → 5172.46] into the unknown
[5172.46 → 5173.16] and into the
[5173.16 → 5174.30] uncomfortable with
[5174.30 → 5175.30] the powerful
[5175.30 → 5177.32] truth of whom
[5177.32 → 5178.56] you are and
[5178.56 → 5179.00] what you have
[5179.00 → 5180.18] done, and with
[5180.18 → 5180.86] the powerful
[5180.86 → 5182.50] promise of what
[5182.50 → 5183.60] you are still
[5183.60 → 5184.72] yet doing.
[5185.30 → 5186.16] In Jesus' name
[5186.16 → 5186.64] we pray.
[5187.34 → 5187.70] Amen.
[5187.70 → 5191.72] This song will
[5191.72 → 5192.86] likely be new for
[5192.86 → 5194.06] many of you, but
[5194.06 → 5195.78] it's pretty easy to
[5195.78 → 5196.60] catch on to, so
[5196.60 → 5197.42] join us when you're
[5197.42 → 5197.74] comfortable.
[5197.88 → 5198.42] Please stand.
[5198.42 → 5219.74] as you go, may you
[5219.74 → 5221.34] know the love of Christ,
[5222.06 → 5223.80] how deep and long,
[5224.10 → 5225.76] how high and wide.
[5225.76 → 5228.84] as you leave, may you
[5228.84 → 5232.00] seek to minimize, and find
[5232.00 → 5234.24] to stand to be your
[5234.24 → 5235.66] life.
[5236.16 → 5239.00] May you go in love of your
[5239.00 → 5242.18] Father God, may you go in
[5242.18 → 5245.76] the grace of Christ, may you
[5245.76 → 5248.50] go in power of the Spirit
[5248.50 → 5251.74] now to bring you glory with
[5251.74 → 5253.34] your life.
[5253.34 → 5256.26] As you go, may you know the
[5256.26 → 5258.96] power of grace, and spend
[5258.96 → 5261.02] the strength for what's to
[5261.02 → 5261.74] come.
[5262.94 → 5265.02] As you leave, may you feel
[5265.02 → 5267.54] his mighty hand, guiding
[5267.54 → 5269.50] your steps, and the race
[5269.50 → 5270.42] you run.
[5271.78 → 5274.58] May you go in love of your
[5274.58 → 5277.72] Father God, may you go in
[5277.72 → 5279.56] the grace of Christ.
[5279.56 → 5283.38] may you go in power of the
[5283.38 → 5286.36] Spirit now, bring your glory
[5286.36 → 5289.18] with your life.
[5289.18 → 5290.18] God bless you.
[5290.18 → 5291.06] As you go, may you feel his
[5291.06 → 5303.14] heart to bless, the ones with
[5303.14 → 5305.86] bless, the blind and lost.
[5306.76 → 5309.32] As you leave, may you be the
[5309.32 → 5312.06] light of Christ, and show your
[5312.06 → 5315.66] hope that you see in the cross.
[5315.66 → 5323.66] May you go in love of your Father now, may you go in the grace of Christ.
[5324.22 → 5332.66] May you go in power of the Spirit now, to bring you glory with your life.
[5333.40 → 5341.14] May you go in love of your Father now, may you go in the grace of Christ.
[5341.14 → 5350.58] May you go in power of the Spirit now, to bring you glory with your life.
[5371.14 → 5371.58] Amen.
[5374.58 → 5381.18] And so, as you go, go with the blessing of God and go with an invitation.
[5381.70 → 5387.42] Stick around following for a time of a fellowship of sharing life and story.
[5387.66 → 5394.20] And go in anticipation of a God who is still at work in the world.
[5395.12 → 5397.40] Go with God's blessing.
[5397.40 → 5401.50] God, go before you, to lead you.
[5402.08 → 5404.02] God, go behind you, to protect you.
[5404.34 → 5406.44] God, go beneath you, to support you.
[5406.80 → 5409.28] God, go beside you, to befriend you.
[5409.70 → 5411.64] Do not be afraid.
[5412.22 → 5414.28] Let the blessing of God come upon you today.
[5414.44 → 5416.40] Do not be afraid.
[5417.40 → 5424.74] But go to a land you know not of, in peace, to love and serve the Lord.
[5424.74 → 5426.14] Amen.
[5427.40 → 5455.62] Sing a song of celebration, lift a shout of praise for the bride who will come.
[5455.62 → 5457.62] The glory is high.
[5457.62 → 5461.62] The glory is high.
[5461.62 → 5469.62] And oh, in the promise day.
[5469.62 → 5478.62] We'll go to a much better way.
[5478.62 → 5480.62] Dance with all your light.
[5480.62 → 5483.62] Dance with all your light.
[5483.62 → 5485.62] Lift your hands.
[5485.62 → 5486.62] Lift your hands.
[5486.62 → 5488.62] We'll die for joy.
[5488.62 → 5490.62] The glory is high.
[5490.62 → 5491.62] And oh, in the promise day.
[5491.62 → 5492.62] And oh, in the promise day.
[5492.62 → 5494.62] And oh, in the promise day.
[5494.62 → 5504.26] And oh, he's my son
[5504.26 → 5515.38] A strong, pure star-spot light
[5515.38 → 5519.88] He will dance in the streets that are cold
[5519.88 → 5524.24] For his pride and grace that I can
[5524.24 → 5528.48] Every time he's tired and peace
[5528.48 → 5534.48] He'll join the Son of the Lamb
[5534.48 → 5542.74] Sing a vow for the time of rejoicing his peace
[5542.74 → 5552.00] The wind in the room is still to the peace
[5552.00 → 5556.24] The wind in the room is still to the peace
[5556.24 → 5564.24] The wind needs to come is now here
[5564.24 → 5570.24] And oh, the Father's will be in the glory of God
[5570.24 → 5574.48] And oh, the Lord's will be in the glory of God
[5574.48 → 5588.72] And oh, the Lord's will be in the glory of God
[5588.72 → 5604.90] We will dance on six levels, for it's dry and grace of man. Every tongue and dry and fish will go.
[5604.90 → 5620.90] We will dance on six levels, for it's dry and grace of man. Every tongue and dry and fish will go.
[5620.90 → 5626.90] We will dance on six levels, for it's dry and grace of man.
