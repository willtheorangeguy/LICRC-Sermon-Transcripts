[0.00 --> 20.00]  I've been sick and tired
[20.00 --> 23.70]  Being sick and tired
[23.70 --> 27.54]  Searching far and wide
[27.54 --> 31.20]  Something that feels real
[31.20 --> 35.08]  Something that feels real
[35.08 --> 37.70]  And I don't wanna lose my soul
[37.70 --> 41.02]  Chasing out the things that don't lead me
[41.02 --> 42.82]  Trained to you
[42.82 --> 47.52]  And I'm lost in a feeling
[47.52 --> 54.80]  That I came from this world
[54.80 --> 58.08]  But going back to Eden
[58.08 --> 60.26]  Ain't gonna be easy
[60.26 --> 63.88]  But at least be straight to you
[63.88 --> 66.02]  And I'm running a move
[66.02 --> 68.56]  Like the particle
[68.56 --> 74.44]  I don't need the money
[74.44 --> 78.76]  I don't want the faith
[78.76 --> 83.78]  I don't want what I can't take with me
[83.78 --> 85.94]  In the grave
[85.94 --> 88.62]  Oh and I don't wanna lose my soul
[88.62 --> 91.90]  Chasing out the things that don't lead me
[91.90 --> 93.72]  Trained to you
[93.72 --> 98.44]  And I'm lost in a feeling
[98.44 --> 105.72]  That I came from this world
[105.72 --> 109.00]  And going back to Eden
[109.00 --> 111.14]  Ain't gonna be easy
[111.14 --> 114.80]  But at least be straight to you
[114.80 --> 116.46]  And I'm running a move
[116.46 --> 119.46]  Like the particle
[119.46 --> 124.96]  I don't wanna lose my soul
[124.96 --> 128.08]  Chasing out the things that don't lead me
[128.08 --> 130.08]  Trained to you
[130.08 --> 132.26]  And I don't wanna lose my gaze
[132.26 --> 134.06]  When I meet you face to face
[134.06 --> 136.16]  Well done, well, come on
[136.16 --> 138.74]  Now I'm running a move
[138.74 --> 141.28]  Like the particle
[141.28 --> 146.28]  I'm lost in a feeling
[146.28 --> 148.28]  I don't want to lose my soul
[148.28 --> 149.44]  And I'm lost in a feeling
[149.44 --> 153.28]  That I came from this world
[153.28 --> 156.28]  And going back to Eden
[156.28 --> 158.28]  Ain't gonna be easy
[158.28 --> 160.28]  But at least be straight to you
[160.28 --> 162.28]  And I'm running a move
[162.28 --> 164.28]  Like the particle
[164.28 --> 170.28]  Lost in a feeling
[170.28 --> 171.62]  Was a girl
[171.62 --> 172.54]  I'm lost in a feeling
[172.54 --> 175.10]  But at least be straight to you
[175.10 --> 175.20]  I'm running a move
[175.20 --> 177.56]  Like the particle
[177.56 --> 181.50]  Lost in a feeling
[181.50 --> 182.60]  It's a girl
[182.60 --> 183.44]  Baite to Imagine
[183.44 --> 185.48]  I'm running a move

[190.10 --> 192.02]  What Maryland
[192.02 --> 192.54]  Laugh
[192.54 --> 193.38]  Aww
[193.38 --> 194.04]  Alle
[194.04 --> 195.26]  All
[195.26 --> 196.08]  Part your
[196.08 --> 196.40]  derni
[200.28 --> 215.26]  I have been working on the ways that I lose my head.
[215.26 --> 220.64]  Sometimes I just can't keep it together.
[220.64 --> 228.54]  I keep trying to soldier on, trying to put it in a song.
[228.54 --> 232.58]  let's press the button for 10 minutes
[232.80 --> 235.72]  no matter how fast he is
[238.56 --> 242.00]  first with two minutes
[242.24 --> 245.54]  on the dip heute
[245.74 --> 249.40]  we found the same way
[250.34 --> 253.78]  in Farewell
[254.22 --> 257.66]  2 minutes
[257.66 --> 274.90]  I'm just trying to understand.
[274.90 --> 278.34]  Is there some master plan?
[278.94 --> 283.26]  Cause I've got so many questions.
[283.26 --> 287.66]  Am I, am I the only one?
[287.66 --> 291.06]  Just like this ladder's missing rocks.
[291.06 --> 295.78]  Cause I can't find a way to climb.
[295.78 --> 296.78]  Yeah.
[296.78 --> 312.38]  Stepping out onto the water.
[313.26 --> 316.66]  Not sure if you'll sink or stand.
[316.66 --> 319.66]  I think fear's pretty normal.
[319.66 --> 322.66]  When you've only ever walked on land.
[322.66 --> 325.98]  Cause to leap into the unknown.
[325.98 --> 328.98]  Is to walk by faith, not sign.
[328.98 --> 332.78]  We all get scared or we don't know.
[332.78 --> 335.02]  But maybe that's alright.
[335.02 --> 338.42]  Faith is like a free fall sometimes.
[338.42 --> 344.42]  I guess I still freak out sometimes.
[344.42 --> 350.90]  Your faith is like a free fall sometimes.
[350.90 --> 358.42]  I guess I still get scared sometimes.
[358.42 --> 359.82]  I guess what you like to goी a little bit so man.
[359.82 --> 361.82]  What it was like to go to speed to Perd Sprint.
[361.82 --> 367.26]  It has freeI like a strong relationship of You.
[367.26 --> 371.74]  Sement of the needle since those lines are bright due to a..."
[371.74 --> 373.66]  Analysis of learningventional so well.
[373.66 --> 375.82]  Yes.
[375.82 --> 388.80]  Faith is like a freefall sometimes
[388.80 --> 394.98]  I guess I still freak out sometimes
[394.98 --> 401.04]  Faith is like a freefall sometimes
[401.04 --> 407.36]  I guess I still get scared sometimes
[407.36 --> 410.58]  Maybe that's alright
[431.04 --> 461.02]  I guess I still get scared sometimes
[461.02 --> 468.02]  I guess I still get scared sometimes
[468.02 --> 475.02]  I guess I still get scared sometimes
[475.02 --> 478.82]  Sometimes you gotta look at the wonder
[478.82 --> 481.02]  Wait for the answer
[481.02 --> 484.18]  When you're chill with your hands in the air
[484.18 --> 486.02]  I'll praise you anyway
[486.02 --> 489.14]  Praise, give him praise, give him praise
[489.14 --> 493.58]  Give him praise, give him praise
[493.58 --> 498.14]  And I, as he is worthy
[498.14 --> 505.14]  Yes, he is worthy of all of the praise
[505.14 --> 507.94]  Two.

[642.60 --> 643.76]  That you can sign up on
[643.76 --> 646.18]  Now back by popular demand
[646.18 --> 647.98]  Last year we had tables
[647.98 --> 649.70]  That were set up in Christmas theme
[649.70 --> 650.72]  And winter theme
[650.72 --> 652.18]  And it went over so well
[652.18 --> 653.34]  We had women say
[653.34 --> 654.28]  Can you do this again?
[654.36 --> 656.06]  Because I have a great plan for this year
[656.06 --> 658.30]  So if you'd like to decorate a table
[658.30 --> 660.68]  There's also a sign up sheet in the back
[660.68 --> 662.04]  And there's some photos from last year
[662.04 --> 662.90]  To give you an idea
[662.90 --> 664.92]  So come visit us after church

[666.80 --> 667.70]  Thank you
[667.70 --> 673.34]  There's also another announcement from Clem
[673.34 --> 679.74]  Good morning all
[679.74 --> 683.58]  I'm one of the deacons here
[683.58 --> 684.54]  My name is Clem
[684.54 --> 687.12]  In July, June, July
[687.12 --> 688.76]  The deacons were sitting around
[688.76 --> 690.42]  Wondering what
[690.42 --> 692.58]  How can we get Emmanuel involved
[692.58 --> 693.64]  In the community more
[693.64 --> 696.80]  So we started an initiative
[696.80 --> 699.30]  For a breakfast program
[699.30 --> 700.20]  That was going on
[700.20 --> 701.34]  In H.D. Stafford
[701.34 --> 702.20]  Middle school
[702.20 --> 704.34]  And we were initially hoping
[704.34 --> 706.32]  For two mornings a month
[706.32 --> 708.02]  But you know how it goes
[708.02 --> 708.84]  This is Emmanuel
[708.84 --> 710.86]  So we ended up with enough volunteers
[710.86 --> 713.14]  To do four mornings a month
[713.14 --> 714.70]  So that was pretty awesome
[714.70 --> 716.92]  So I just want to say a big thank you
[716.92 --> 717.94]  To all the volunteers
[717.94 --> 719.08]  That signed up for that
[719.08 --> 720.20]  So
[720.20 --> 725.00]  So now
[725.00 --> 727.06]  The coordinator of the breakfast
[727.06 --> 728.34]  And lunch programs
[728.34 --> 730.30]  For the downtown Langley area
[730.30 --> 731.76]  Has asked us

[732.72 --> 734.64]  To do about ten
[734.64 --> 736.12]  Christmas hampers
[736.12 --> 737.16]  Specifically
[737.16 --> 739.34]  The Nicomackal Elementary School
[739.34 --> 741.12]  A very needy area
[741.12 --> 742.34]  Of downtown Langley
[742.34 --> 745.04]  We are looking for families
[745.04 --> 746.66]  Groups of friends
[746.66 --> 747.74]  Care groups
[747.74 --> 748.96]  And individuals
[748.96 --> 750.24]  Who would be able
[750.24 --> 751.80]  To supply Christmas hampers
[751.80 --> 753.58]  For ten families total
[753.58 --> 755.16]  We are waiting
[755.16 --> 756.50]  For a few more details
[756.50 --> 757.66]  Family sizes
[757.66 --> 758.52]  And suggestions
[758.52 --> 760.08]  On what to put in the hampers
[760.08 --> 762.38]  So if you're interested

[859.04 --> 859.70]  And
[859.70 --> 859.90] ona
[859.90 --> 864.20]  Good morning, everyone.
[865.20 --> 871.34]  Our call to worship this morning comes from Psalm 86, verses 8 to 10.
[871.92 --> 876.62]  There is none like you, O Lord, nor are there any works like yours.
[877.24 --> 881.60]  All the nations you have made shall come and bow down before you, O Lord,
[881.98 --> 883.90]  and shall glorify your name.
[883.90 --> 887.56]  For you are great, and you do wondrous things.
[887.90 --> 889.60]  You alone are God.
[889.90 --> 912.16]  O Lord, my God, when I in awesome wonder consider all the works thy hand hath made.
[912.16 --> 917.46]  I see the stars.
[918.00 --> 922.16]  I hear the rolling thunder.
[923.22 --> 929.16]  Thy power throughout the universe display.
[929.16 --> 938.16]  Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee.
[938.16 --> 947.16]  How great thou art.
[947.16 --> 948.16]  How great thou art.
[948.16 --> 960.16]  How great thou art.
[960.16 --> 962.16]  How great thou art.
[962.16 --> 973.16]  When through the woods and forest glades I wonder.
[973.16 --> 982.16]  And hear the birds, sing sweetly in the trees.
[982.16 --> 992.76]  When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur
[992.76 --> 1001.10]  And hear the flow and feel the gentle breeze
[1001.10 --> 1008.78]  Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee
[1008.78 --> 1018.12]  How great thou art, how great thou art
[1018.12 --> 1026.02]  Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee
[1026.02 --> 1035.04]  How great thou art, how great thou art
[1035.04 --> 1043.80]  And when I think that God his Son must carry
[1043.80 --> 1052.38]  Sent him to die, I scarce can take it in
[1052.38 --> 1061.72]  That on the cross my burden gladly bearing
[1061.72 --> 1069.38]  He bled and died to take away my sin
[1069.38 --> 1078.72]  Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee
[1078.72 --> 1087.40]  How great thou art, how great thou art
[1087.40 --> 1096.16]  Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee
[1096.16 --> 1104.00]  How great thou art, how great thou art
[1104.00 --> 1108.00]  When Christ shall come
[1108.00 --> 1113.34]  With shouts of acclamation
[1113.34 --> 1117.00]  And take me whole
[1117.70 --> 1122.20]  What joy shall fill my heart
[1122.20 --> 1126.00]  Then I shall bow
[1126.00 --> 1131.00]  In humble adoration
[1131.00 --> 1131.34]  In humble adoration
[1131.34 --> 1134.76]  And there proclaim
[1134.76 --> 1139.00]  My God, how great thou art
[1139.00 --> 1148.00]  Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee
[1148.00 --> 1153.00]  How great thou art, how great thou art
[1153.00 --> 1157.00]  How great thou art
[1157.00 --> 1165.00]  Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee
[1165.00 --> 1171.00]  How great thou art, how great thou art
[1171.00 --> 1172.00]  How great thou art
[1172.00 --> 1194.00]  How great thou art
[1194.00 --> 1206.30]  The splendor of the King
[1206.30 --> 1210.80]  Clothed in majesty
[1210.80 --> 1215.86]  Let all the earth rejoice
[1215.86 --> 1218.86]  All the earth rejoice
[1218.86 --> 1226.72]  He wraps himself in light
[1226.72 --> 1232.36]  And darkness tries to hide
[1232.36 --> 1236.00]  And trembles at his voice
[1236.00 --> 1240.20]  And trembles at his voice
[1240.20 --> 1245.80]  How great is our God
[1245.80 --> 1251.66]  Sing with me how great is our God
[1251.66 --> 1255.66]  And all will see how great
[1255.66 --> 1263.66]  How great is our God
[1263.66 --> 1271.52]  Reach to which he stands
[1271.52 --> 1277.64]  And time is in his hands
[1277.64 --> 1280.52]  Beginning and the end
[1280.52 --> 1284.52]  Beginning and the end
[1284.52 --> 1290.38]  The Lord is free and one
[1290.38 --> 1296.46]  Fall is spirit and sound
[1296.46 --> 1299.66]  The lion and the lamb
[1299.66 --> 1303.38]  The lion and the lamb
[1303.38 --> 1309.24]  How great is our God
[1309.24 --> 1313.24]  Sing with me how great
[1313.24 --> 1315.24]  Is our God
[1315.24 --> 1319.24]  And all will see how great
[1319.24 --> 1325.24]  How great is our God
[1325.24 --> 1332.10]  Name and love
[1332.10 --> 1332.40]  Name and love
[1332.40 --> 1333.10]  All of us
[1333.10 --> 1337.10]  Worthy of all praise
[1337.10 --> 1341.10]  Worthy of all praise
[1341.10 --> 1344.10]  My heart will sing
[1344.10 --> 1349.10]  How great is our God
[1349.10 --> 1358.96]  How great is our God
[1358.96 --> 1360.96]  How great is our God
[1360.96 --> 1364.96]  How great is our God
[1364.96 --> 1369.82]  Sing with me how great
[1369.82 --> 1374.82]  How great is our God
[1374.82 --> 1382.82]  How great is our God
[1382.82 --> 1385.82]  Sing with me how great
[1385.82 --> 1389.26]  How great is our God
[1389.26 --> 1393.26]  And all will see how great
[1393.26 --> 1399.26]  How great is our God
[1399.26 --> 1404.80]  Please bow your heads with me
[1404.80 --> 1408.58]  Merciful God
[1408.58 --> 1411.24]  You pardon all who truly repent
[1411.24 --> 1412.22]  And turn to you
[1412.22 --> 1415.38]  We humbly confess our sins
[1415.38 --> 1416.52]  And ask your mercy
[1416.52 --> 1418.62]  We have not loved you
[1418.62 --> 1419.56]  With a pure heart
[1419.56 --> 1421.34]  Nor have we loved our neighbor
[1421.34 --> 1422.20]  As ourselves
[1422.20 --> 1424.66]  We have not done justice
[1424.66 --> 1425.90]  Loved kindness
[1425.90 --> 1427.62]  Or walked humbly with you
[1427.62 --> 1428.36]  Our God
[1428.36 --> 1430.64]  Have mercy on us
[1430.64 --> 1431.08]  O God
[1431.08 --> 1432.18]  In your loving kindness
[1432.18 --> 1433.52]  In your great compassion
[1433.52 --> 1435.06]  Cleanse us from our sin
[1435.06 --> 1438.10]  May we collectively echo the words
[1438.10 --> 1439.74]  From Psalm 51
[1439.74 --> 1442.86]  Create in us a clean heart
[1442.86 --> 1443.52]  O God
[1443.52 --> 1445.24]  And renew a right spirit
[1445.24 --> 1445.94]  Within us
[1445.94 --> 1448.08]  Do not cast us from your presence
[1448.08 --> 1449.96]  Or take your Holy Spirit from us
[1449.96 --> 1452.02]  Restore to us the joy
[1452.02 --> 1453.16]  Of your salvation
[1453.16 --> 1454.72]  And sustain us
[1454.72 --> 1456.14]  With your bountiful spirit
[1456.14 --> 1457.72]  Through Jesus Christ
[1457.72 --> 1458.62]  Our Lord
[1458.62 --> 1459.58]  Amen
[1459.58 --> 1473.72]  Create in me
[1473.72 --> 1477.80]  Create in me a clean heart
[1477.80 --> 1480.20]  O God
[1480.20 --> 1484.14]  And renew a right spirit
[1484.14 --> 1486.72]  Within me
[1486.72 --> 1490.74]  Create in me
[1490.74 --> 1491.46]  Create in me
[1491.46 --> 1491.74]  Create in me
[1491.74 --> 1492.74]  Create in me
[1492.74 --> 1494.74]  A clean heart
[1494.74 --> 1497.00]  O God
[1497.00 --> 1500.80]  And reveal a right spirit
[1500.80 --> 1501.86]  Within me
[1501.86 --> 1509.08]  Cast me away
[1509.08 --> 1509.14]  Cast me away
[1509.14 --> 1511.08]  From thy presence
[1511.08 --> 1511.34]  From thy presence
[1511.34 --> 1513.08]  O Lord
[1513.08 --> 1518.36]  And take not my Holy Spirit
[1518.36 --> 1520.14]  From thee
[1520.14 --> 1526.44]  Restore unto me
[1526.44 --> 1530.46]  The joy of thy salvation
[1530.46 --> 1534.48]  And renew a right spirit
[1534.48 --> 1534.54]  And renew a right spirit
[1534.54 --> 1536.48]  Within me
[1536.48 --> 1540.54]  Create in me
[1540.54 --> 1541.74]  Create in me
[1541.74 --> 1543.54]  A clean heart
[1543.54 --> 1546.48]  O God
[1546.48 --> 1553.18]  Escape in me
[1553.18 --> 1556.50]  Create in me
[1556.50 --> 1557.12]  Create in me
[1557.12 --> 1559.00]  Create in me
[1559.00 --> 1564.40]  A clean heart
[1564.40 --> 1572.40]  And renew the right spirit within me
[1572.40 --> 1581.40]  Cast me not away from thy presence alone
[1582.40 --> 1588.40]  And take not thy Holy Spirit from me
[1588.40 --> 1599.40]  Restore unto thee the joy of thy salvation
[1600.40 --> 1607.40]  And renew the right spirit within me
[1607.40 --> 1616.40]  Here are words you may trust, words that merit full acceptance.
[1617.40 --> 1621.40]  Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.
[1622.40 --> 1628.40]  To all who confess their sins and resolve to lead a new life, he says,
[1629.40 --> 1630.40]  Your sins are forgiven.
[1631.40 --> 1633.40]  He also says, Follow me.
[1633.40 --> 1643.40]  Now to the one who rules all worlds, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever.
[1644.40 --> 1652.40]  And now, confident our sins are forgiven, let us await in hope the final coming, our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1653.40 --> 1659.40]  And on that final day where we can join the saints and angels and sing the hymn of heaven together,
[1659.40 --> 1662.40]  Shouting holy is the Lord.
[1662.40 --> 1663.40]  Praise the Lord.
[1663.40 --> 1664.40]  How I long to breathe the air of heaven, where pain is gone, and mercy fills the streets.
[1664.40 --> 1665.40]  To look upon the path of heaven, where pain is gone, and mercy fills the streets.
[1665.40 --> 1666.40]  To look upon the path of heaven, where pain is gone, and mercy fills the streets.
[1666.40 --> 1667.40]  To look upon the path of heaven, and mercy fills the streets.
[1667.40 --> 1668.40]  To look upon the path of heaven, and mercy fills the streets.
[1668.40 --> 1669.40]  To look upon the path of heaven, and mercy fills the streets.
[1669.40 --> 1670.40]  To look upon the path of heaven, and mercy fills the streets.
[1670.40 --> 1671.40]  Thank you, Lord.
[1671.40 --> 1673.40]  How I long to breathe the air of heaven, where pain is gone, and mercy fills the streets.
[1673.40 --> 1684.08]  How I long to breathe the air of heaven
[1684.08 --> 1692.24]  Where pain is gone and mercy fills the streets
[1692.24 --> 1699.42]  To look upon the one who led to save me
[1699.42 --> 1705.26]  And walk with Him for all eternity
[1705.26 --> 1716.42]  There will be a day when all will bow before Him
[1717.00 --> 1723.42]  There will be a day when death will be no one
[1724.26 --> 1727.54]  Standing face to face
[1727.54 --> 1732.66]  When He who died and rose again
[1732.66 --> 1738.88]  Holy, holy is the Lord
[1738.88 --> 1748.82]  And every prayer we prayed in desperation
[1748.82 --> 1756.94]  The songs of faith we sang through doubt and evil
[1756.94 --> 1763.52]  In the end we'll see that it was perfect
[1763.52 --> 1771.94]  When He returns to wipe away our tears
[1771.94 --> 1781.48]  There will be a day when all will bow before Him
[1781.48 --> 1788.06]  There will be a day when death will be no one
[1788.06 --> 1791.06]  Standing face to face
[1791.06 --> 1796.18]  Then He who died and rose again
[1796.18 --> 1803.18]  Holy, holy is the Lord
[1803.18 --> 1813.34]  And on that day we joined the resurrection
[1813.34 --> 1821.46]  And stand beside the heroes of the faith
[1821.46 --> 1827.72]  With one voice a thousand generations
[1827.72 --> 1834.46]  Sing worthy is the Lamb who was slain
[1834.46 --> 1842.58]  And on that day we joined the resurrection
[1842.58 --> 1849.46]  And stand beside the heroes of the faith
[1849.46 --> 1855.58]  And with one voice a thousand generations
[1855.58 --> 1861.70]  Sing worthy is the Lamb who was slain
[1861.70 --> 1864.70]  Sing worthy is the Lamb who was slain
[1864.70 --> 1869.98]  Forever He shall reign
[1869.98 --> 1877.66]  There will be a day
[1877.66 --> 1881.66]  When all will bow before Him
[1881.66 --> 1884.88]  There will be a day
[1884.88 --> 1888.84]  When death will be no more
[1888.84 --> 1892.02]  Standing face to face
[1892.02 --> 1897.30]  With He who died and rose again
[1897.30 --> 1902.88]  Holy, holy is the Lord
[1902.88 --> 1906.06]  So let it be today
[1906.06 --> 1909.50]  We shout with Him in heaven
[1909.50 --> 1912.98]  With angels and the saints
[1912.98 --> 1916.92]  We raise His heart here, Lord
[1916.92 --> 1920.06]  Glory to our God
[1920.06 --> 1925.50]  Who gave us life beyond the grave
[1925.50 --> 1931.08]  Holy, holy is the Lord
[1931.08 --> 1939.08]  Holy, holy is the Lord
[1939.08 --> 1946.96]  Holy, holy is the Lord
[1946.96 --> 1950.82]  May we have a sip
[1950.82 --> 1974.40]  Good morning
[1974.40 --> 1975.66]  My name is Lina
[1975.66 --> 1977.26]  I am one of the demons here
[1977.26 --> 1979.34]  Today the offerings are
[1979.34 --> 1980.92]  First, the budget
[1980.92 --> 1984.08]  Which is for our day-to-day running of our church
[1984.08 --> 1987.26]  Second is the ministry to seafarers
[1987.26 --> 1991.18]  Whose vision is to visit as many ships as possible
[1991.18 --> 1993.42]  Through the port of Vancouver
[1993.42 --> 1996.16]  These visits give them opportunity
[1996.16 --> 2000.42]  To share the good news of God's love in Jesus Christ
[2000.42 --> 2003.84]  With seafarers in word and deed
[2003.84 --> 2007.28]  By providing literature and other resources
[2007.28 --> 2011.12]  They also serve them in practical ways
[2011.12 --> 2013.08]  At the seafarers center
[2013.08 --> 2017.64]  Engaging in quality Christian dialogue wherever possible
[2017.64 --> 2022.44]  They have been supported by two classes of BC
[2022.44 --> 2024.26]  And two in Alberta
[2024.26 --> 2026.92]  That stopped in 2023
[2026.92 --> 2031.08]  So now they have to rely on church offerings
[2031.08 --> 2034.44]  Which means they need it now more than ever
[2034.44 --> 2037.10]  God bless you in your giving
[2037.10 --> 2041.84]  Next special collection is for world renewed
[2041.84 --> 2046.42]  Refugee sponsorship and resettlement
[2046.42 --> 2067.88]  A thousand generations
[2067.88 --> 2071.60]  Falling down in worship
[2071.60 --> 2077.16]  To sing the song of ages to the Lamb
[2077.16 --> 2083.26]  And all who've gone before us
[2083.26 --> 2086.50]  And all who will believe
[2086.50 --> 2091.66]  Will sing the song of ages to the Lamb
[2091.66 --> 2097.82]  Your name is the highest
[2097.82 --> 2101.38]  Your name is the greatest
[2101.38 --> 2107.38]  Your name stands above the Lord
[2107.38 --> 2111.48]  All thrones and dominions
[2111.48 --> 2114.48]  All powers and positions
[2115.04 --> 2120.52]  Your name stands above the Lord
[2120.52 --> 2123.86]  And the angels cry
[2123.86 --> 2130.42]  Holy of creation Christ
[2130.42 --> 2137.58]  Holy you are lifted high
[2137.58 --> 2144.10]  Holy, holy forever
[2144.10 --> 2151.66]  If you've been forgiven
[2151.66 --> 2152.38]  If you've been forgiven
[2152.38 --> 2156.38]  And may you've been redeemed
[2156.38 --> 2161.18]  Sing the song forever to the Lamb
[2161.18 --> 2166.44]  If you walk in freedom
[2166.44 --> 2170.24]  May you bear the same
[2170.24 --> 2175.86]  Sing the song forever to the Lamb
[2175.86 --> 2178.04]  Sing the song forever to the Lamb
[2178.04 --> 2179.84]  Sing the song forever to the Lamb
[2179.84 --> 2181.24]  Sing the song forever and the Lamb
[2181.24 --> 2183.02]  And the angels cry
[2183.02 --> 2185.60]  And the angels cry
[2185.60 --> 2191.96]  Holy of creation Christ
[2191.96 --> 2199.44]  Holy you are lifted high
[2199.44 --> 2205.62]  Holy, holy forever
[2205.62 --> 2212.62]  Hear your people sing
[2212.62 --> 2219.72]  Holy to the King of kings
[2219.72 --> 2225.74]  Holy, you will always be
[2225.74 --> 2232.28]  Holy, holy forever
[2232.28 --> 2241.42]  Your name is the highest
[2241.42 --> 2244.70]  Your name is the greatest
[2244.70 --> 2250.76]  Your name stands above them all
[2250.76 --> 2255.24]  All thrones and dominions
[2255.24 --> 2258.34]  All powers and positions
[2258.34 --> 2263.62]  Your name stands above them all
[2263.62 --> 2266.92]  And the angels cry
[2266.92 --> 2273.56]  Holy, all creation cries
[2273.56 --> 2280.50]  Holy, you are lifted high
[2280.50 --> 2286.44]  Holy, holy forever
[2286.44 --> 2293.18]  Hear your people sing
[2293.18 --> 2299.60]  Holy to the King of kings
[2299.60 --> 2306.18]  Holy, you will always be
[2306.18 --> 2312.12]  Holy, holy forever
[2312.12 --> 2316.12]  Holy, holy forever
[2316.12 --> 2319.86]  You will always be
[2319.86 --> 2323.86]  Holy, holy forever
[2323.86 --> 2327.86]  Holy, holy forever
[2327.86 --> 2337.80]  Amen
[2337.80 --> 2341.80]  Amen
[2341.80 --> 2343.80]  Amen
[2343.80 --> 2345.54]  Good morning, everybody
[2345.54 --> 2349.02]  I am Amy Huberts, the Children's Worship Coordinator
[2349.02 --> 2355.56]  Emmanuel, and I would like to invite all the preschoolers up to grade four
[2355.56 --> 2357.26]  To come on up to the front
[2357.26 --> 2367.34]  Awesome guys, how is everybody doing this morning?
[2368.18 --> 2368.90]  Good
[2368.90 --> 2369.90]  Have you guys ever had?
[2369.90 --> 2376.88]  Have you guys ever had someone do something so nice for you that you were so shocked?
[2378.22 --> 2379.34]  Have you guys ever had?
[2379.92 --> 2380.64]  No?
[2380.84 --> 2383.00]  Have you guys ever done something?
[2383.42 --> 2389.34]  Have you guys ever done something for someone else that made them smile?
[2389.34 --> 2390.34]  No?
[2390.34 --> 2391.34]  No?
[2391.34 --> 2392.34]  No?
[2392.34 --> 2393.34]  No?
[2393.34 --> 2398.28]  Do you guys remember treat take in the church?
[2398.28 --> 2399.28]  Yeah?
[2399.28 --> 2401.28]  And those were what?
[2401.28 --> 2403.28]  What did we do with them?
[2403.28 --> 2406.28]  Do you want to say it?
[2406.28 --> 2407.28]  What did we do?
[2407.28 --> 2414.28]  We had treat takes and we gave it to other people in the church so they were kind of like acts of kindness
[2414.28 --> 2419.28]  And we were giving them all to everybody and put smiles on everybody's faces
[2419.28 --> 2425.96]  What kind of things could you do at home or to your friends that would put a smile on their face?
[2427.80 --> 2429.52]  You guys are quiet this morning
[2429.52 --> 2436.94]  What could you do for your brother or sister?
[2440.28 --> 2441.50]  Could, yeah?
[2444.28 --> 2448.78]  Yes, if you have a leftover birthday treat you can give it to them
[2448.78 --> 2449.78]  That's right
[2449.78 --> 2450.78]  Is there anything else?
[2450.78 --> 2452.78]  What could you do for your mom or dad?
[2457.28 --> 2459.38]  Yes, do your chores without asking
[2459.38 --> 2460.28]  Those are awesome
[2460.28 --> 2465.28]  So today our big idea in children's worship time in the K to 4 side
[2465.28 --> 2469.28]  Is God's kindness brings people together
[2469.28 --> 2473.28]  So we are going to be talking about Moses
[2473.28 --> 2475.28]  And ask when he grew up
[2475.28 --> 2477.28]  I know last week you talked about him as a baby
[2477.28 --> 2483.28]  When he grew up and how he was trying to help out his people
[2483.28 --> 2485.28]  But then he had to go away
[2485.28 --> 2488.28]  And God put people in his life
[2488.28 --> 2490.28]  To give him kindness
[2490.28 --> 2493.28]  I have one more thing
[2493.28 --> 2495.28]  Why do you think I have
[2495.28 --> 2498.28]  I didn't set them up today
[2498.28 --> 2501.28]  But why do you think I have dominoes?
[2501.28 --> 2506.28]  Why do you think I have dominoes today?
[2506.28 --> 2508.28]  Well one dominoes
[2508.28 --> 2510.28]  Well one dominoes
[2510.28 --> 2512.28]  What happens to dominoes when you set them up?
[2512.28 --> 2513.28]  Yes
[2513.28 --> 2516.28]  They all fall down
[2516.28 --> 2518.28]  So when we do acts of kindness
[2518.28 --> 2520.28]  We can touch one person
[2520.28 --> 2523.28]  And then we hit the dominoes
[2523.28 --> 2524.28]  It's like dominoes effect
[2524.28 --> 2529.28]  And they all will affect many other people
[2529.28 --> 2532.28]  So one person will be affected
[2532.28 --> 2534.28]  And then this person will give an acts of kindness
[2534.28 --> 2535.28]  To that person
[2535.28 --> 2537.28]  And that person
[2537.28 --> 2538.28]  Okay
[2538.28 --> 2542.28]  Okay can everybody stand up?
[2542.28 --> 2545.28]  And we're going to face the church
[2545.28 --> 2548.28]  And look at the church and say
[2548.28 --> 2549.28]  You guys ready?
[2549.28 --> 2551.28]  The Lord be with you
[2551.28 --> 2553.28]  And also with you
[2578.28 --> 2585.28]  My name is John
[2585.28 --> 2587.28]  And I'm one of the elders of the church here
[2587.28 --> 2590.28]  And I will be leading us in our congregational prayer
[2593.28 --> 2594.28]  Lord as we have been singing
[2594.28 --> 2596.28]  Holy, holy, holy is your name
[2596.28 --> 2598.28]  Lord we come before you
[2598.28 --> 2599.28]  As the great God
[2599.28 --> 2600.28]  The only God
[2600.28 --> 2602.28]  The God who created this world
[2603.28 --> 2605.28]  The God who gave us a place here
[2605.28 --> 2608.28]  And a place that
[2608.28 --> 2610.28]  We are going to be a people
[2610.28 --> 2613.28]  To give you the praise that is due your name
[2614.28 --> 2616.28]  Lord, often times we don't do that
[2616.28 --> 2619.28]  Often times we put our own selves first
[2620.28 --> 2622.28]  And Lord that is our sinful nature
[2622.28 --> 2626.28]  And we need your spirit and your strength
[2626.28 --> 2628.28]  To be able to combat that
[2628.28 --> 2629.28]  To turn to you
[2630.28 --> 2632.28]  To allow your spirit to fill our lives
[2632.28 --> 2634.28]  That we can serve you each and every day
[2635.28 --> 2636.28]  Better and better
[2639.28 --> 2640.28]  Lord we do
[2641.28 --> 2643.28]  Have a congregation that is active and busy
[2644.28 --> 2645.28]  And we pray a blessing on
[2645.28 --> 2646.28]  Children's worship time
[2647.28 --> 2648.28]  Cadet and Gems Ministries
[2649.28 --> 2650.28]  Coffee break
[2650.28 --> 2651.28]  Lord we have many people that are
[2652.28 --> 2653.28]  Active and serving
[2654.28 --> 2656.28]  And we ask your blessing and strength
[2656.28 --> 2658.28]  For each one of those in their tasks and duties
[2659.28 --> 2661.28]  Lord we also pray a blessing on council
[2662.28 --> 2663.28]  As we have a meeting this week
[2663.28 --> 2665.28]  Lord as council members
[2665.28 --> 2666.28]  We
[2667.28 --> 2669.28]  We find the strength of you
[2669.28 --> 2672.28]  To be able to provide leadership in this congregation
[2673.28 --> 2675.28]  Lord we are thankful for preaching staff
[2676.28 --> 2677.28]  For Kevin and Chris
[2678.28 --> 2680.28]  And pray for the work that they do
[2681.28 --> 2682.28]  Leading our congregation
[2683.28 --> 2686.28]  Lord we have many needs in our congregation
[2686.28 --> 2690.28]  And health is one of those issues that come up regularly
[2691.28 --> 2692.28]  We pray for
[2693.28 --> 2696.28]  Jaredina Johnson's
[2697.28 --> 2700.28]  Granddaughter Christina who has been diagnosed with lupus
[2701.28 --> 2704.28]  And waiting more tests to determine treatment
[2705.28 --> 2707.28]  We pray a blessing on her
[2707.28 --> 2710.28]  Lord that the doctors may be the
[2711.28 --> 2713.28]  Find a way to provide help and healing
[2714.28 --> 2717.28]  Lord we also pray for Ken Hoko
[2718.28 --> 2719.28]  One of his sister Magna
[2720.28 --> 2724.28]  She has stage 4 cancer and has gone into palliative care
[2725.28 --> 2729.28]  We pray a blessing on her and strengthen the family as they deal with this difficult time
[2729.28 --> 2739.28]  Lord we pray for those that have lost loved ones and have gone to be with you
[2740.28 --> 2744.28]  We think of Greta Kapper's mom and Nikki's grandmother
[2745.28 --> 2746.28]  Lord that is just this past week
[2747.28 --> 2750.28]  And we pray for comfort and strength as they go through the grieving and burial process
[2750.28 --> 2758.28]  Lord we also pray for Morgue Kunst as she laid her father to rest in the last while
[2759.28 --> 2761.28]  We pray for comfort for that family as well
[2762.28 --> 2766.28]  Lord there's others in our church who the grief has only been a month old
[2767.28 --> 2769.28]  Or sometimes a year or 10 years old
[2770.28 --> 2774.28]  Lord I pray that we as a community may be able to uphold these families and individuals
[2775.28 --> 2776.28]  And share in that grief
[2776.28 --> 2779.28]  Lord we pray for a greater world
[2780.28 --> 2783.28]  We know there are still many conflicts happening
[2784.28 --> 2786.28]  We pray for the war in Ukraine
[2787.28 --> 2791.28]  Also for the war with Israel and the Palestinians
[2792.28 --> 2795.28]  Lord we don't know why this always happens
[2796.28 --> 2797.28]  But we pray for your peace
[2798.28 --> 2800.28]  That we may see conflicts cease
[2800.28 --> 2810.28]  Lord we pray that in this coming week we may set our hearts for the Lord's Supper this coming Sunday
[2811.28 --> 2815.28]  We may truly come and examine ourselves
[2816.28 --> 2823.28]  And Lord come before you knowing that we can be blessed in what you have done for us on the cross so many years ago
[2823.28 --> 2826.28]  Lord we pray a blessing on the preaching this morning
[2827.28 --> 2829.28]  Lord we pray for Pastor Chris as he leads us
[2830.28 --> 2832.28]  That his words may be your words
[2833.28 --> 2835.28]  That we may be able to take those words to heart
[2836.28 --> 2838.28]  That we may be able to live them in our lives in this coming week
[2839.28 --> 2841.28]  Lord to another member of our extended church family
[2841.28 --> 2842.28]  Brenda and Linda and Jody's mum
[2843.28 --> 2844.28]  Has recurring cancer
[2845.28 --> 2847.28]  And she had to go to the hospital again for continued study and treatment
[2847.28 --> 2851.28]  We pray a blessing on her as she goes through that difficult time for a second time in her life
[2851.28 --> 2855.28]  Lord as the words of the psalmist say
[2855.28 --> 2862.66]  has a recurring cancer, and she had to go into hospital again for continued study and treatment.
[2862.90 --> 2867.80]  We pray a blessing on her as she goes through that difficult time for a second time in her life.
[2871.58 --> 2873.78]  Lord, as the words of the psalmist say,
[2875.14 --> 2877.68]  Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth.
[2878.30 --> 2879.74]  Worship the Lord with gladness.
[2880.62 --> 2882.62]  Come before him with singing and with joy.
[2882.62 --> 2885.46]  Acknowledge that the Lord is God.
[2886.06 --> 2888.26]  He made us, and we are his.
[2889.12 --> 2891.50]  We are his people, the sheep of his pasture.
[2893.02 --> 2894.62]  Enter his gates with thanksgiving.
[2895.42 --> 2897.24]  Go into his courts with praise.
[2898.50 --> 2900.84]  Give thanks to him and praise his name.
[2901.78 --> 2902.96]  For the Lord is good.
[2903.88 --> 2906.30]  His unfailing love continues forever.
[2907.34 --> 2909.72]  His faithfulness to each generation.
[2909.72 --> 2917.50]  Lord, as we have seen this happen in the time of families losing loved ones,
[2918.66 --> 2921.58]  Lord, we know that it is you that upholds us.
[2922.02 --> 2923.74]  It is you that we can turn to for strength.
[2925.50 --> 2927.12]  And Lord, as we go out this coming week,
[2927.66 --> 2930.46]  that we would share that with others around us,
[2931.14 --> 2932.54]  in our life, in our work,
[2933.34 --> 2934.16]  in our studies.
[2935.16 --> 2937.76]  Lord, we ask that your spirit may bless us.
[2937.76 --> 2940.64]  We ask that in the name of Jesus Christ,
[2940.76 --> 2941.54]  our Lord and Savior.
[2942.32 --> 2942.64]  Amen.
[2942.64 --> 2942.78]  Amen.
[2942.78 --> 2969.56]  This morning, we are continuing our close reading in the book of Romans,
[2969.56 --> 2974.02]  Romans, and we are going to read together from chapter 9,
[2974.20 --> 2975.32]  starting at verse 30,
[2975.48 --> 2980.30]  and then we are going to read through to verse 13 of chapter 10.
[2982.56 --> 2984.96]  As always, as we are digging into this,
[2985.02 --> 2986.96]  the first time through, it will be on the screen,
[2987.32 --> 2988.60]  but we will come back,
[2988.86 --> 2992.68]  and we will dig pretty deeply together this morning.
[2992.68 --> 2994.24]  And so I always encourage you,
[2994.46 --> 2996.54]  have your own Bible open in front of you.
[2998.10 --> 3000.10]  If you brought one from home, excellent.
[3000.60 --> 3001.30]  Mark it up.
[3001.52 --> 3003.54]  Go ahead, draw lines, highlight things.
[3004.06 --> 3006.02]  If you are using one of the Bibles from the back,
[3006.44 --> 3008.22]  honestly, draw lines, mark it up,
[3008.36 --> 3009.50]  and go ahead and use it,
[3009.52 --> 3010.92]  because we are buying new ones next year anyway.
[3013.76 --> 3015.20]  And then you can take those ones home.
[3015.32 --> 3015.70]  It is okay.
[3015.70 --> 3020.42]  But we do want to encourage you to have that open.
[3020.72 --> 3024.84]  I think it will help as we go through this time together.
[3025.70 --> 3030.60]  So that's beginning in verse 30 of chapter 9.
[3030.60 --> 3035.20]  What then shall we say?
[3036.74 --> 3040.02]  That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness,
[3040.26 --> 3041.14]  have obtained it,
[3041.72 --> 3044.02]  a righteousness that is by faith.
[3044.88 --> 3046.10]  But the people of Israel,
[3046.30 --> 3048.74]  who pursued the law as the way of righteousness,
[3049.10 --> 3050.68]  have not attained their goal.
[3051.68 --> 3052.26]  Why not?
[3052.60 --> 3055.96]  Because they pursued it not by faith,
[3056.06 --> 3057.82]  but as if it were by works.
[3057.82 --> 3060.90]  They stumbled over the stumbling stone.
[3062.00 --> 3062.76]  As it is written,
[3062.98 --> 3067.20]  See, I lay in Zion a stone that causes people to stumble,
[3067.64 --> 3069.28]  and a rock that makes them fall.
[3069.68 --> 3072.68]  And the one who believes in him will never be put to shame.
[3073.96 --> 3075.12]  Brothers and sisters,
[3075.34 --> 3078.82]  my heart's desire and prayer to God for the Israelites
[3078.82 --> 3080.96]  is that they may be saved.
[3081.70 --> 3085.00]  For I can testify about them that they are zealous for God,
[3085.00 --> 3088.02]  but their zeal is not based on knowledge.
[3088.02 --> 3090.86]  Since they did not know the righteousness of God
[3090.86 --> 3092.86]  and sought to establish their own,
[3093.12 --> 3095.50]  they did not submit to God's righteousness.
[3096.52 --> 3099.08]  Christ is the culmination of the law
[3099.08 --> 3102.68]  so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.
[3104.98 --> 3108.84]  Moses writes this about the righteousness that is by the law.
[3109.74 --> 3112.52]  The person who does these things will live by them.
[3112.52 --> 3116.04]  But the righteousness that is by faith says,
[3116.54 --> 3119.20]  Do not say in your heart who will ascend into heaven,
[3119.30 --> 3120.82]  that is, to bring Christ down,
[3120.88 --> 3122.96]  or who will descend into the deep,
[3123.04 --> 3125.02]  that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.
[3125.62 --> 3126.84]  But what does it say?
[3127.62 --> 3129.34]  The word is in you.
[3129.70 --> 3131.38]  It is in your mouth and in your heart.
[3131.74 --> 3134.74]  That is, the message concerning faith that we proclaim,
[3135.08 --> 3136.88]  if you declare with your mouth,
[3137.06 --> 3137.98]  Jesus is Lord,
[3138.06 --> 3141.02]  and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead,
[3141.02 --> 3142.72]  you will be saved.
[3143.42 --> 3145.96]  For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified,
[3146.38 --> 3150.02]  and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.
[3151.20 --> 3152.50]  As Scripture says,
[3152.66 --> 3155.64]  anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame.
[3156.44 --> 3159.04]  There is no difference between Jew and Gentile.
[3159.40 --> 3161.62]  The same Lord is Lord of all
[3161.62 --> 3164.28]  and richly blesses all who call on him.
[3164.60 --> 3169.30]  For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.
[3169.30 --> 3170.54]  Amen.
[3171.04 --> 3172.12]  This is the word of the Lord.
[3176.30 --> 3178.40]  So as we have been in this series,
[3178.52 --> 3180.10]  and in particular these chapters,
[3180.70 --> 3184.02]  we have acknowledged just how difficult
[3184.02 --> 3186.82]  and how hard it can be to understand
[3186.82 --> 3188.70]  kind of what's going on here.
[3190.18 --> 3191.16]  And to be fair,
[3191.56 --> 3194.20]  when we are wrestling with something this hard,
[3194.20 --> 3197.76]  as a bit of a rhetorical device,
[3198.10 --> 3201.32]  I like to stand up and at the beginning try to say something funny
[3201.32 --> 3203.34]  or to try to draw you in,
[3203.40 --> 3205.14]  but the truth is I'm not really that funny.
[3205.76 --> 3208.20]  And so what I usually do is default to making fun of Kevin.
[3209.82 --> 3212.54]  And I just can't do that this week.
[3212.54 --> 3218.82]  Because there's something else that's on my mind
[3218.82 --> 3220.02]  and has been on my mind
[3220.02 --> 3224.80]  and has been occupying my brain space
[3224.80 --> 3226.16]  as I've been preparing for this.
[3226.50 --> 3227.24]  And to be honest,
[3227.62 --> 3232.28]  the thing that I think about most often
[3232.28 --> 3233.62]  as a leader in the church
[3233.62 --> 3237.00]  and as a pastor in the Christian church
[3237.00 --> 3246.06]  is what will the church do or be,
[3246.20 --> 3248.62]  what will we as Christians be
[3248.62 --> 3251.30]  for the next generation of believers?
[3253.28 --> 3256.60]  My heart in ministry and in leadership
[3256.60 --> 3260.00]  is for you 20-year-olds.
[3260.00 --> 3262.88]  Right?
[3262.94 --> 3265.06]  It's for you, Gen Alpha,
[3265.38 --> 3267.08]  you teenagers right now.
[3268.74 --> 3271.30]  And honestly, every time we make a decision
[3271.30 --> 3272.72]  or every ministry direction
[3272.72 --> 3275.62]  that we wonder about prayerfully pursuing,
[3276.06 --> 3279.06]  I run it through the rubric in my own head
[3279.06 --> 3279.92]  and in my own heart.
[3280.10 --> 3282.88]  How is this helping us at Langley Emanuel
[3282.88 --> 3284.78]  grow younger?
[3286.54 --> 3288.16]  Now some of you are familiar with that language,
[3288.16 --> 3289.64]  the language of growing young.
[3290.00 --> 3293.58]  It comes from the Fuller Institute in California.
[3293.78 --> 3295.36]  They've done a whole bunch of research on this.
[3295.46 --> 3297.12]  Honestly, I have a shelf full of books
[3297.12 --> 3298.34]  in my own library
[3298.34 --> 3299.80]  dealing with this very topic
[3299.80 --> 3302.20]  about how the church will grow younger
[3302.20 --> 3306.10]  and how the church will engage the next generation.
[3306.54 --> 3308.12]  And I mean the generation after me
[3308.12 --> 3309.06]  because for some of you,
[3309.12 --> 3310.30]  I'm the next generation.
[3312.04 --> 3313.04]  But I'm 40.
[3314.74 --> 3317.32]  I'm no longer the next generation.
[3317.32 --> 3319.18]  I haven't been for about 20 years.
[3320.00 --> 3321.18]  It's hard to admit.
[3324.62 --> 3328.12]  And there have been countless studies
[3328.12 --> 3330.58]  and questions from hemorrhaging faith
[3330.58 --> 3332.42]  to renegotiating faith in Canada
[3332.42 --> 3335.56]  to You Lost Me by the Barner Group
[3335.56 --> 3337.30]  and Un-Christian by the same.
[3337.84 --> 3340.08]  And then the Fuller Institute
[3340.08 --> 3341.92]  recently in their book, Growing Young,
[3342.00 --> 3342.92]  pulled these all together.
[3343.34 --> 3346.20]  James Avery White talking about Generation Alpha
[3346.20 --> 3347.82]  published just in the last couple of years.
[3347.82 --> 3350.18]  All of this is in my space,
[3350.54 --> 3351.54]  my mind space,
[3351.88 --> 3353.72]  as I leave the church
[3353.72 --> 3355.86]  because,
[3356.82 --> 3358.88]  and I tried to find who said it,
[3358.94 --> 3360.06]  but it's been said so often
[3360.06 --> 3362.62]  that it becomes one of those internet memes things, right?
[3363.48 --> 3365.04]  But there's a saying out there
[3365.04 --> 3365.50]  that says,
[3365.62 --> 3368.36]  the church is always one generation away from extinction.
[3368.36 --> 3371.84]  Now, as a Reformed Christian,
[3371.84 --> 3374.18]  I know that that's not true, right?
[3374.24 --> 3375.94]  Like the Bible teaches very clearly
[3375.94 --> 3380.00]  that God always has a remnant that He keeps, right?
[3380.04 --> 3381.98]  The Belgic Confession says very clearly,
[3382.46 --> 3383.70]  because Christ is King,
[3383.80 --> 3385.36]  He will never be without subjects.
[3385.54 --> 3388.18]  There's always going to be a church,
[3388.32 --> 3389.62]  but what that doesn't promise
[3389.62 --> 3391.16]  is that there will always be this church.
[3391.16 --> 3396.40]  And that's what I want to wonder about.
[3401.52 --> 3403.94]  And as I think about those things,
[3404.94 --> 3408.24]  as I try to lead from that perspective,
[3408.24 --> 3412.86]  I am mindful of the fact,
[3412.94 --> 3414.12]  and the studies bear this out,
[3414.28 --> 3415.84]  anecdotal evidence bears this out,
[3415.92 --> 3419.66]  and conversations with people here bear this out,
[3419.72 --> 3422.04]  that one of the reasons
[3422.04 --> 3427.10]  that young people leave the church,
[3427.24 --> 3428.26]  one of the reasons, honestly,
[3428.40 --> 3429.54]  anyone leaves the church,
[3429.60 --> 3431.16]  but you see this more in young people
[3431.16 --> 3433.08]  because of the kinds of values that they hold,
[3433.80 --> 3438.06]  is because the Christian faith for so many of us
[3438.06 --> 3443.14]  has been exchanged for something else.
[3444.50 --> 3448.74]  It's been substituted for a soft,
[3449.06 --> 3450.70]  vaguely Christian morality,
[3451.30 --> 3457.36]  or it's been exchanged for a particularly hard definition
[3457.36 --> 3459.68]  of what it means to live in the world,
[3459.80 --> 3461.44]  and so there's legalistic structures,
[3461.82 --> 3464.00]  and there's judgment, and there's impositions,
[3464.40 --> 3467.34]  and because for so many people
[3467.34 --> 3470.16]  who look at the generations ahead of them,
[3470.24 --> 3472.24]  who look at us older generations,
[3472.24 --> 3475.78]  they go, where does this actually show up?
[3478.20 --> 3482.74]  Does believing in Jesus actually change your life?
[3483.94 --> 3487.26]  Does it make a difference in your heart
[3487.26 --> 3488.96]  and in how you live in the world?
[3488.96 --> 3491.98]  Because for so many people,
[3491.98 --> 3493.76]  they look at the church,
[3493.76 --> 3497.18]  and they don't see a difference.
[3498.84 --> 3502.30]  It doesn't change in our heart of hearts
[3502.30 --> 3503.92]  how we engage the world.
[3504.02 --> 3506.62]  Instead, we value the same things.
[3506.84 --> 3508.74]  We want the same things.
[3509.02 --> 3511.82]  We pursue the same type of life
[3511.82 --> 3513.28]  or way of being in the world,
[3513.28 --> 3515.30]  and honestly,
[3516.10 --> 3518.74]  that's not very attractive.
[3520.06 --> 3521.10]  You're like, what's the point?
[3521.62 --> 3522.34]  Why bother?
[3522.70 --> 3523.80]  Why do all this work?
[3524.12 --> 3526.70]  Why miss good brunch on Sunday
[3526.70 --> 3529.48]  and come to church instead?
[3531.98 --> 3532.92]  Some of you are thinking,
[3533.02 --> 3533.54]  yeah, you know what?
[3533.60 --> 3533.98]  That's right.
[3534.38 --> 3536.30]  Holland eggs over eggs benny
[3536.30 --> 3538.14]  would have been better than Pastor Chris right now.
[3538.14 --> 3541.88]  Why is that?
[3543.44 --> 3545.92]  Where's that compelling aspect?
[3547.02 --> 3549.28]  Now, I introduced this
[3549.28 --> 3551.08]  because it's part of my brain space,
[3551.34 --> 3555.96]  and I think that part of
[3555.96 --> 3557.14]  what we're going to discuss this morning,
[3557.30 --> 3560.80]  part of what we see Paul talking about this morning
[3560.80 --> 3563.44]  and calling us to know and believe
[3563.44 --> 3565.12]  and then therefore be
[3565.12 --> 3571.18]  helps meet some of that wrong assumption head-on
[3571.18 --> 3573.62]  and helps challenge some of that reality.
[3575.14 --> 3578.12]  And so, I beg of you,
[3578.76 --> 3581.04]  let's do this hard work together
[3581.04 --> 3583.46]  because I really think it matters.
[3584.84 --> 3587.14]  Not only for us here,
[3587.14 --> 3591.18]  but for the next generation of Christians
[3591.18 --> 3594.46]  rising up in the world today.
[3595.80 --> 3596.88]  So, as we dig,
[3596.98 --> 3599.42]  remember then where we have been.
[3600.08 --> 3600.24]  Okay?
[3600.38 --> 3601.98]  So, hopefully your Bibles are open.
[3602.10 --> 3604.64]  I'm going to jump around chapter 9 a little bit
[3604.64 --> 3606.00]  coming into where we are.
[3606.96 --> 3609.00]  Paul, the Apostle Paul,
[3609.68 --> 3611.18]  writing to a group of Christians
[3611.18 --> 3612.26]  that he has not met,
[3612.34 --> 3614.28]  a church that he has not founded,
[3614.48 --> 3616.74]  but many of whom he knows by name
[3616.74 --> 3617.76]  or by influence,
[3618.76 --> 3620.84]  Paul is writing to them
[3620.84 --> 3624.06]  this magnum opus of a letter
[3624.06 --> 3625.56]  in the book of Romans
[3625.56 --> 3627.32]  and he has come to this point
[3627.32 --> 3629.22]  where he is anguished
[3629.22 --> 3631.04]  in soul and in heart
[3631.04 --> 3633.34]  over his fellow Israelites
[3633.34 --> 3634.30]  not believing.
[3635.10 --> 3637.16]  Even though, he says,
[3637.22 --> 3638.74]  they've had every advantage
[3638.74 --> 3640.04]  and every opportunity.
[3641.60 --> 3643.12]  Now, the historical reality
[3643.12 --> 3645.52]  that Paul is writing into here
[3645.52 --> 3648.20]  is that once the disciples
[3648.20 --> 3649.98]  left Judea,
[3650.70 --> 3651.96]  right, Jesus commissioned them
[3651.96 --> 3653.30]  to go into all the world
[3653.30 --> 3654.12]  as missionaries,
[3654.44 --> 3656.52]  once the early church was founded
[3656.52 --> 3660.02]  in most every major Roman city
[3660.02 --> 3660.86]  in the empire,
[3661.12 --> 3663.12]  the majority of Christians,
[3663.32 --> 3664.70]  that is the majority of people
[3664.70 --> 3666.66]  who repent and believe,
[3667.08 --> 3668.86]  are not Jewish.
[3668.86 --> 3673.98]  And that breaks Paul's Jewish heart.
[3675.58 --> 3677.06]  The Jewish people, Paul says,
[3677.12 --> 3678.00]  had the promises,
[3678.22 --> 3679.24]  the prophets, the law,
[3679.34 --> 3679.94]  and the temple.
[3680.54 --> 3682.08]  We can build on that.
[3682.14 --> 3683.78]  They had Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[3683.96 --> 3685.64]  They had Moses, Joshua, and David.
[3685.82 --> 3688.30]  They had Isaiah, Elijah, and Ezekiel.
[3688.38 --> 3690.64]  They had Deborah and Naomi and Esther.
[3690.64 --> 3694.10]  And even with every advantage,
[3695.04 --> 3698.70]  so many of them missed Jesus.
[3698.86 --> 3703.96]  Now, Paul makes the point
[3703.96 --> 3706.36]  in chapter 9 very clearly
[3706.36 --> 3708.12]  that the advantage
[3708.12 --> 3711.46]  does not equal the lived reality.
[3712.88 --> 3712.96]  Right?
[3713.06 --> 3714.08]  Having the advantage
[3714.08 --> 3716.04]  does not mean you automatically get it.
[3716.68 --> 3716.86]  Right?
[3716.88 --> 3718.52]  He says in verse 6,
[3718.78 --> 3720.86]  not all who are descended from Israel
[3720.86 --> 3721.74]  are Israel.
[3722.34 --> 3723.74]  The point he makes there,
[3723.76 --> 3725.28]  and we looked at this a couple weeks ago,
[3725.52 --> 3727.24]  is that there's a deeper
[3727.24 --> 3729.02]  spiritual identity
[3729.02 --> 3730.34]  that matters.
[3730.34 --> 3732.12]  A spiritual identity
[3732.12 --> 3734.80]  and a reality that is held,
[3735.14 --> 3736.78]  upheld, and directed
[3736.78 --> 3739.36]  by a sovereign God.
[3740.46 --> 3741.56]  And remember, right,
[3741.70 --> 3744.34]  sovereignty is the theological word
[3744.92 --> 3747.74]  for God's right to rule and reign.
[3748.64 --> 3749.76]  We have said before,
[3749.88 --> 3751.44]  for God to be God,
[3751.54 --> 3753.26]  he must be sovereign.
[3753.26 --> 3756.42]  And as sovereign God
[3756.42 --> 3758.48]  does what he does,
[3759.28 --> 3761.08]  he does so in order that,
[3761.14 --> 3761.68]  verse 11,
[3761.78 --> 3762.78]  if you're following along,
[3763.28 --> 3765.14]  his purpose in election
[3765.14 --> 3766.52]  might stand.
[3767.84 --> 3769.00]  Now, election means
[3769.00 --> 3770.76]  that God chooses
[3770.76 --> 3772.42]  and makes you able
[3772.42 --> 3773.60]  to choose in response.
[3774.14 --> 3775.96]  And as Paul says in verse 12,
[3776.46 --> 3777.70]  it's not by works,
[3777.92 --> 3779.34]  but by him who calls.
[3779.34 --> 3781.80]  And Paul continues.
[3781.92 --> 3783.24]  He underscores this point
[3783.24 --> 3785.04]  in the sovereignty of God
[3785.04 --> 3785.74]  by saying,
[3786.50 --> 3787.30]  verse 16,
[3787.40 --> 3788.48]  for you who are following along,
[3789.74 --> 3790.70]  it does not depend
[3790.70 --> 3792.58]  on human desire or effort,
[3792.78 --> 3794.72]  but on God's mercy.
[3796.48 --> 3797.14]  And we learned
[3797.14 --> 3798.16]  from the first part
[3798.16 --> 3799.48]  of the book of Romans, right,
[3799.54 --> 3801.26]  that we've been given over
[3801.26 --> 3802.80]  to our sinful desires.
[3802.94 --> 3804.14]  That's chapter 1, verse 24.
[3804.66 --> 3805.28]  And so,
[3805.50 --> 3806.48]  what we're seeing again
[3806.48 --> 3807.50]  is that salvation
[3807.50 --> 3808.66]  cannot depend
[3808.66 --> 3809.82]  on human desire
[3809.82 --> 3810.70]  because we would
[3810.70 --> 3811.56]  never desire it.
[3812.98 --> 3813.32]  Right?
[3813.36 --> 3815.42]  We learned in chapter 3
[3815.42 --> 3816.76]  that there is no one
[3816.76 --> 3817.18]  righteous,
[3817.32 --> 3818.06]  not even one.
[3818.16 --> 3818.74]  There's no one
[3818.74 --> 3819.54]  who understands.
[3819.92 --> 3820.90]  There is not one
[3820.90 --> 3821.94]  who seeks God.
[3822.06 --> 3823.02]  There is no one
[3823.02 --> 3823.94]  who does good,
[3824.28 --> 3825.18]  not even one.
[3825.98 --> 3826.84]  And so,
[3827.08 --> 3828.30]  salvation can't depend
[3828.30 --> 3829.18]  on human effort
[3829.18 --> 3829.58]  because,
[3830.42 --> 3830.86]  to be frank,
[3830.86 --> 3832.10]  we just don't have it in us.
[3832.70 --> 3833.46]  But we can't lift
[3833.46 --> 3834.04]  that weight.
[3834.04 --> 3836.58]  It has to be
[3836.58 --> 3838.08]  God's mercy.
[3839.08 --> 3840.10]  All of this
[3840.10 --> 3840.92]  has to be
[3840.92 --> 3842.16]  from Him
[3842.16 --> 3843.38]  and of Him
[3843.38 --> 3844.92]  because you and I
[3844.92 --> 3846.56]  just don't desire it
[3846.56 --> 3847.84]  and just can't do it
[3847.84 --> 3848.92]  apart from Him
[3848.92 --> 3850.30]  doing it in us.
[3851.38 --> 3853.08]  And the reality
[3853.08 --> 3853.98]  that we're beginning
[3853.98 --> 3855.70]  to unpack here
[3855.70 --> 3856.10]  is that
[3856.10 --> 3858.30]  if you find yourself
[3858.30 --> 3859.48]  desiring it,
[3860.06 --> 3861.92]  even while struggling,
[3861.92 --> 3864.32]  if you find yourself
[3864.32 --> 3865.68]  able to do these things
[3865.68 --> 3867.00]  that God calls us to do,
[3867.26 --> 3868.80]  even in the midst
[3868.80 --> 3870.20]  of repeated failure,
[3871.40 --> 3872.66]  even in the midst
[3872.66 --> 3873.88]  of it being imperfect,
[3874.62 --> 3876.14]  the spiritual reality
[3876.14 --> 3877.00]  behind that
[3877.00 --> 3877.92]  or undergirding
[3877.92 --> 3878.52]  all of that
[3878.52 --> 3879.30]  is that He,
[3879.56 --> 3879.82]  God,
[3879.88 --> 3880.92]  has already done
[3880.92 --> 3881.90]  something in you.
[3882.10 --> 3883.20]  He's already started
[3883.20 --> 3884.46]  something in you.
[3885.68 --> 3886.84]  And in theology,
[3887.22 --> 3888.36]  we call that
[3888.36 --> 3889.06]  regeneration.
[3889.06 --> 3891.72]  Now, I know that
[3891.72 --> 3892.36]  that for some
[3892.36 --> 3893.72]  is a $5
[3893.72 --> 3895.48]  pastor study word,
[3896.16 --> 3896.60]  but it comes
[3896.60 --> 3897.08]  from the Bible.
[3897.62 --> 3899.14]  Titus 3, 5
[3899.14 --> 3900.40]  puts it this way
[3900.40 --> 3900.82]  and I think
[3900.82 --> 3901.76]  it helps our understanding.
[3903.46 --> 3904.68]  He saved us
[3904.68 --> 3906.04]  not because of
[3906.04 --> 3907.12]  righteous things
[3907.12 --> 3907.94]  we had done,
[3908.08 --> 3909.04]  but because of
[3909.04 --> 3910.00]  His mercy.
[3910.12 --> 3910.96]  He saved us
[3910.96 --> 3911.78]  through the washing
[3911.78 --> 3912.90]  of rebirth
[3912.90 --> 3914.14]  and renewal
[3914.14 --> 3915.32]  by the Holy Spirit.
[3916.40 --> 3917.36]  The ESV
[3917.36 --> 3918.68]  translates that same line,
[3918.68 --> 3919.20]  but according
[3919.20 --> 3919.94]  to His own mercy
[3919.94 --> 3920.96]  by the washing
[3920.96 --> 3922.32]  of regeneration,
[3923.34 --> 3924.44]  the renewal
[3924.44 --> 3926.10]  of His Spirit.
[3927.24 --> 3927.74]  And so I hope
[3927.74 --> 3929.30]  that as you play
[3929.30 --> 3929.84]  with that word
[3929.84 --> 3930.60]  in your imagination
[3930.60 --> 3931.36]  that you begin
[3931.36 --> 3932.24]  to see it, right?
[3932.36 --> 3933.26]  You have re,
[3933.46 --> 3935.16]  re meaning again,
[3935.68 --> 3935.88]  right?
[3936.08 --> 3937.10]  And generation
[3937.10 --> 3938.58]  meaning born out
[3938.58 --> 3939.18]  or to.
[3939.84 --> 3940.58]  Regeneration
[3940.58 --> 3941.58]  literally means
[3941.58 --> 3942.86]  born again.
[3944.66 --> 3945.48]  Remember what Jesus
[3945.48 --> 3947.16]  said in John 3,
[3947.32 --> 3947.98]  verse 3.
[3948.68 --> 3949.64]  Very truly,
[3949.80 --> 3950.34]  I tell you,
[3950.90 --> 3951.94]  no one can see
[3951.94 --> 3953.10]  the kingdom of God
[3953.10 --> 3954.38]  unless they are
[3954.38 --> 3956.88]  born again.
[3959.18 --> 3960.12]  That's Paul's
[3960.12 --> 3961.84]  point here.
[3963.04 --> 3963.66]  Salvation
[3963.66 --> 3965.10]  comes by
[3965.10 --> 3966.04]  believing,
[3966.48 --> 3967.44]  by faith,
[3967.48 --> 3968.46]  because of
[3968.46 --> 3969.72]  God's mercy.
[3970.24 --> 3970.76]  Belief
[3970.76 --> 3971.82]  comes not
[3971.82 --> 3972.72]  by works,
[3972.72 --> 3974.08]  but as God's gift
[3974.08 --> 3974.84]  to those
[3974.84 --> 3975.34]  who are
[3975.34 --> 3976.48]  born again,
[3976.62 --> 3976.92]  who are
[3976.92 --> 3978.26]  regenerated.
[3979.90 --> 3980.10]  Now,
[3980.30 --> 3981.52]  I get it,
[3982.00 --> 3982.94]  and I see it
[3982.94 --> 3983.92]  in some of you.
[3984.12 --> 3985.06]  You're glazing over
[3985.06 --> 3985.92]  and you're wondering
[3985.92 --> 3986.78]  what is the purpose
[3986.78 --> 3987.40]  of all of this
[3987.40 --> 3988.00]  and how on earth
[3988.00 --> 3988.74]  does this connect
[3988.74 --> 3989.84]  to that struggle
[3989.84 --> 3990.40]  at the beginning?
[3990.96 --> 3991.52]  And I get not
[3991.52 --> 3992.06]  everyone loves
[3992.06 --> 3993.10]  theology behind it.
[3993.56 --> 3994.70]  So let me simplify.
[3996.44 --> 3997.70]  In order for you
[3997.70 --> 3998.70]  to have faith,
[3999.10 --> 3999.66]  to believe,
[3999.66 --> 4001.40]  you must be
[4001.40 --> 4003.12]  born of faith.
[4003.82 --> 4004.72]  Born again
[4004.72 --> 4005.72]  or regenerated.
[4005.90 --> 4007.20]  That's the big idea
[4007.20 --> 4008.24]  this morning.
[4008.48 --> 4009.86]  This is the banner
[4009.86 --> 4011.24]  that we are operating
[4011.24 --> 4011.48]  under.
[4011.56 --> 4012.84]  In order to have faith,
[4012.94 --> 4013.66]  you must be
[4013.66 --> 4014.98]  born of faith.
[4016.00 --> 4017.04]  The word used
[4017.04 --> 4017.52]  for that
[4017.52 --> 4018.80]  is regeneration.
[4020.00 --> 4020.76]  And that regeneration
[4020.76 --> 4022.42]  is not in response
[4022.42 --> 4023.82]  to anything you do,
[4023.82 --> 4024.42]  but
[4024.42 --> 4026.20]  God's mercy
[4026.20 --> 4027.50]  and His choice.
[4028.82 --> 4029.12]  Again,
[4029.12 --> 4029.86]  let me say it clearly.
[4030.32 --> 4032.14]  Because of God's choice,
[4032.30 --> 4033.30]  because of His purpose
[4033.30 --> 4034.06]  in election,
[4034.24 --> 4035.54]  He is merciful to some,
[4035.86 --> 4037.46]  and those who receive
[4037.46 --> 4038.54]  God's mercy,
[4038.84 --> 4040.04]  He regenerates.
[4040.12 --> 4040.36]  That is,
[4040.40 --> 4041.80]  He makes born again.
[4042.38 --> 4044.54]  Those who are born again
[4044.54 --> 4046.10]  have faith.
[4047.12 --> 4047.80]  Or to put it
[4047.80 --> 4050.00]  in classical terms,
[4050.66 --> 4051.36]  regeneration
[4051.36 --> 4053.62]  precedes faith.
[4056.80 --> 4057.40]  Now,
[4057.40 --> 4059.56]  if you know
[4059.56 --> 4060.40]  church history,
[4061.34 --> 4062.62]  you know that
[4062.62 --> 4063.76]  those are fighting words.
[4066.06 --> 4066.58]  Regeneration
[4066.58 --> 4067.48]  precedes faith.
[4068.22 --> 4069.36]  That's a core
[4069.36 --> 4070.52]  doctrine of the
[4070.52 --> 4071.68]  Reformed Church,
[4071.74 --> 4072.40]  part of which
[4072.40 --> 4073.00]  we are,
[4073.08 --> 4074.70]  the Christian Reformed Church.
[4075.08 --> 4075.72]  That's not just
[4075.72 --> 4076.46]  a fancy word,
[4076.56 --> 4077.10]  that's a title
[4077.10 --> 4079.26]  that associates us
[4079.26 --> 4080.26]  with a certain history
[4080.26 --> 4081.54]  and lineage in faith.
[4082.18 --> 4083.92]  And in the 17th century,
[4083.92 --> 4085.90]  this idea that
[4085.90 --> 4087.74]  regeneration precedes faith
[4087.74 --> 4090.00]  is a hallmark
[4090.00 --> 4091.52]  of the Reformed
[4091.52 --> 4092.28]  versus the
[4092.28 --> 4093.74]  Remonstrance debate
[4093.74 --> 4094.42]  that took place
[4094.42 --> 4095.14]  in the Netherlands,
[4095.36 --> 4095.94]  for instance.
[4097.12 --> 4098.82]  In the 5th century,
[4099.04 --> 4100.22]  even further back,
[4100.32 --> 4102.42]  this is the hallmark
[4102.42 --> 4103.50]  of the debate
[4103.50 --> 4105.34]  between Augustine
[4105.34 --> 4106.38]  as a church father
[4106.38 --> 4107.60]  and Pelagius
[4107.60 --> 4109.66]  as another theologian
[4109.66 --> 4110.18]  of the time,
[4110.32 --> 4111.08]  Augustinian and
[4111.08 --> 4112.66]  Pelagian controversy.
[4112.66 --> 4114.70]  A little bit more recently,
[4114.92 --> 4116.24]  in the 18th century,
[4116.50 --> 4117.34]  this idea
[4117.34 --> 4118.14]  that regeneration
[4118.14 --> 4119.46]  precedes faith
[4119.46 --> 4122.36]  was part and parcel
[4122.36 --> 4123.66]  of the back and forth
[4123.66 --> 4125.14]  between a preacher
[4125.14 --> 4126.24]  named John Wesley,
[4126.44 --> 4127.44]  who was more Arminian,
[4127.64 --> 4128.18]  and a preacher
[4128.18 --> 4129.20]  named George Whitefield,
[4129.28 --> 4130.10]  who was more Reformed.
[4131.46 --> 4132.58]  As well, this week,
[4132.66 --> 4133.18]  and I get it,
[4133.20 --> 4133.78]  I'm nerding out,
[4133.88 --> 4134.48]  just bear with me
[4134.48 --> 4135.18]  for a few more minutes.
[4136.04 --> 4136.76]  This week,
[4136.82 --> 4137.70]  I read a letter
[4137.70 --> 4139.46]  by Jonathan Edwards,
[4140.38 --> 4142.40]  who in the 18th century
[4142.40 --> 4143.78]  was a pastor
[4143.78 --> 4144.60]  in New England.
[4145.40 --> 4146.16]  He wrote a letter
[4146.16 --> 4147.60]  to Jonathan Erskine,
[4148.18 --> 4149.20]  who was a pastor
[4149.20 --> 4150.42]  at the same time
[4150.42 --> 4151.08]  in Scotland,
[4151.66 --> 4153.10]  and they were discussing
[4153.10 --> 4154.50]  a critique
[4154.50 --> 4157.76]  of Henry Holmes,
[4157.96 --> 4159.12]  Lord Kames,
[4159.38 --> 4160.30]  in Scotland
[4160.30 --> 4162.06]  that he was writing
[4162.06 --> 4163.28]  about Jonathan Edwards,
[4163.38 --> 4164.22]  and the exchange
[4164.22 --> 4164.94]  back and forth
[4164.94 --> 4166.24]  was on the interpretation
[4166.24 --> 4167.26]  of this doctrine.
[4168.42 --> 4169.30]  Point is,
[4169.34 --> 4169.80]  and the reason why
[4169.80 --> 4171.08]  I'm sharing this,
[4171.46 --> 4171.86]  is that there's been
[4171.86 --> 4173.26]  a lot of ink spilt
[4173.26 --> 4174.68]  over this idea.
[4176.04 --> 4176.88]  And I don't want to
[4176.88 --> 4177.78]  too easily dismiss
[4177.78 --> 4178.54]  any of that.
[4179.08 --> 4179.98]  And I'm happy to have
[4179.98 --> 4181.14]  any further conversation
[4181.14 --> 4182.28]  that anyone wants to have.
[4182.64 --> 4184.54]  But the clearest sense,
[4185.06 --> 4186.56]  the clearest sense
[4186.56 --> 4187.50]  that I can make
[4187.50 --> 4188.72]  of what Paul says here
[4188.72 --> 4189.22]  in the text
[4189.22 --> 4190.04]  that we read
[4190.04 --> 4192.28]  in verse 30
[4192.28 --> 4193.88]  connects directly
[4193.88 --> 4194.80]  to regeneration
[4195.38 --> 4196.46]  preceding faith
[4196.46 --> 4199.58]  and the vitality
[4199.58 --> 4200.68]  of the Christian church
[4200.68 --> 4202.56]  in today's world.
[4203.96 --> 4205.02]  Let me draw that line
[4205.02 --> 4205.32]  for you.
[4205.42 --> 4206.14]  Look at verse 30.
[4207.46 --> 4207.94]  Paul says,
[4208.80 --> 4210.22]  What then shall we say?
[4210.74 --> 4211.82]  That the Gentiles
[4211.82 --> 4212.70]  who did not pursue
[4212.70 --> 4213.16]  righteousness
[4213.16 --> 4213.98]  have obtained it,
[4214.04 --> 4214.70]  a righteousness
[4214.70 --> 4217.50]  that is by faith.
[4218.54 --> 4218.86]  Right?
[4218.90 --> 4220.38]  That only makes sense
[4220.38 --> 4222.10]  if regeneration
[4222.10 --> 4224.08]  precedes faith.
[4224.08 --> 4226.38]  We didn't pursue
[4226.38 --> 4227.04]  righteousness.
[4229.04 --> 4230.02]  But grace,
[4230.14 --> 4230.66]  by grace,
[4230.78 --> 4231.34]  we have it.
[4232.08 --> 4233.64]  And how can we get it
[4233.64 --> 4235.08]  unless it was given?
[4235.86 --> 4237.72]  Because we didn't go get it.
[4240.72 --> 4242.06]  We have it
[4242.06 --> 4243.78]  because of faith.
[4244.66 --> 4246.76]  But faith that we didn't make
[4246.76 --> 4248.24]  or we didn't work out,
[4248.24 --> 4250.08]  faith that was given.
[4250.08 --> 4252.62]  Belief comes
[4252.62 --> 4254.94]  after regeneration.
[4255.26 --> 4255.50]  And again,
[4255.82 --> 4256.66]  I get that I'm,
[4257.54 --> 4258.98]  this is maybe technical.
[4260.06 --> 4260.48]  Remember,
[4260.82 --> 4261.06]  you know,
[4261.08 --> 4261.72]  a couple weeks ago
[4261.72 --> 4262.12]  we said we had to
[4262.12 --> 4262.74]  roll up our sleeves.
[4263.12 --> 4263.88]  Our sleeves are fully
[4263.88 --> 4264.64]  rolled up right now.
[4265.72 --> 4267.00]  But why does this matter?
[4267.80 --> 4268.98]  Or does it matter?
[4270.18 --> 4270.66]  Let me just say
[4270.66 --> 4272.00]  by way of contrast,
[4272.50 --> 4273.44]  it matters
[4273.44 --> 4274.48]  in Paul's writing here
[4274.48 --> 4275.40]  for the Israelites
[4275.40 --> 4277.46]  who missed out on it
[4277.46 --> 4279.24]  because they came at it wrong.
[4280.08 --> 4280.72]  Right?
[4280.80 --> 4281.88]  They're operating
[4281.88 --> 4283.88]  out of non-regeneration
[4283.88 --> 4284.88]  and operating
[4284.88 --> 4285.78]  out of non-regeneration
[4285.78 --> 4287.50]  will always default
[4287.50 --> 4290.30]  to law and legalism.
[4291.52 --> 4292.12]  Again,
[4292.32 --> 4293.14]  look at what Paul writes
[4293.14 --> 4293.96]  in verse 31.
[4296.22 --> 4297.90]  The people of Israel,
[4298.04 --> 4298.48]  and remember,
[4298.64 --> 4299.54]  Paul's made a distinction
[4299.54 --> 4301.10]  that not all of Israel
[4301.10 --> 4302.00]  is Israel.
[4302.22 --> 4303.46]  These are the non-spiritual
[4303.46 --> 4304.88]  descendants of Abraham,
[4305.08 --> 4305.24]  right?
[4305.72 --> 4307.06]  The people of Israel
[4307.06 --> 4308.34]  who pursued the law
[4308.34 --> 4309.52]  as the way of righteousness
[4309.52 --> 4311.24]  have not attained
[4311.24 --> 4312.44]  their goal.
[4313.70 --> 4315.26]  So they tried the law
[4315.26 --> 4316.32]  as a way of righteousness
[4316.32 --> 4317.66]  and they didn't get
[4317.66 --> 4318.18]  what they wanted.
[4319.26 --> 4319.96]  Why not?
[4320.04 --> 4320.76]  Well, Paul continues
[4320.76 --> 4321.54]  in verse 32,
[4322.24 --> 4323.46]  because they pursued it
[4323.46 --> 4324.54]  not by faith,
[4324.98 --> 4326.30]  but as if it were
[4326.30 --> 4327.70]  by works.
[4329.12 --> 4329.40]  You see,
[4329.46 --> 4331.02]  they thought they could do it
[4331.02 --> 4332.50]  or that they had to do it
[4332.50 --> 4333.30]  on their own
[4333.30 --> 4335.16]  or for their own.
[4335.16 --> 4337.34]  And that's why
[4337.34 --> 4338.40]  this doctrine matters.
[4339.84 --> 4340.28]  And here's why
[4340.28 --> 4341.54]  the doctrine of generation
[4341.54 --> 4342.66]  preceding faith
[4342.66 --> 4344.32]  continues to be so important,
[4344.44 --> 4344.62]  right?
[4344.66 --> 4346.34]  Because we live in a world
[4346.34 --> 4347.96]  and we live in a time
[4347.96 --> 4350.24]  when most people think,
[4350.60 --> 4352.74]  especially in the West,
[4352.88 --> 4354.52]  especially with the legacy
[4354.52 --> 4355.76]  of Christian morality
[4355.76 --> 4357.04]  that stands behind us,
[4357.30 --> 4357.92]  people think,
[4358.34 --> 4360.98]  let me do just a few good things
[4360.98 --> 4362.42]  and I'll be all right.
[4362.42 --> 4364.82]  if I'm a good person
[4364.82 --> 4366.90]  and I do good things,
[4367.08 --> 4367.20]  right?
[4367.22 --> 4368.48]  And when I say good things,
[4368.56 --> 4369.62]  here in the language
[4369.62 --> 4370.14]  of the Bible,
[4370.52 --> 4371.26]  pursue the law
[4371.26 --> 4372.16]  as the way of righteousness,
[4372.52 --> 4374.02]  if I do those good things,
[4374.14 --> 4374.96]  I'll be fine.
[4377.22 --> 4377.66]  Right?
[4377.74 --> 4379.36]  Even if there is a God
[4379.36 --> 4380.86]  or even if there isn't,
[4381.26 --> 4382.66]  all you have to do
[4382.66 --> 4383.48]  is try.
[4385.16 --> 4387.02]  That's the world we live in.
[4388.26 --> 4388.38]  Right?
[4388.48 --> 4391.06]  And let's be honest,
[4391.06 --> 4393.76]  not just the world out there,
[4393.80 --> 4394.58]  but the world in here,
[4394.82 --> 4395.04]  right?
[4395.18 --> 4397.12]  We're part and parcel of this.
[4398.70 --> 4399.64]  It's not even that
[4399.64 --> 4400.56]  we have to try hard.
[4402.12 --> 4402.28]  Right?
[4402.28 --> 4403.18]  Just do a little bit
[4403.18 --> 4404.52]  and that'll be enough.
[4405.78 --> 4406.70]  But what does Paul say?
[4407.14 --> 4407.62]  Paul says,
[4407.72 --> 4408.90]  they have not attained
[4408.90 --> 4409.60]  their goal.
[4410.08 --> 4411.22]  Their goal was
[4411.22 --> 4412.44]  the righteousness of God
[4412.44 --> 4413.48]  and the kingdom of heaven,
[4413.58 --> 4414.84]  but they didn't get it.
[4416.40 --> 4416.82]  And so,
[4416.82 --> 4418.72]  why do so many of us
[4418.72 --> 4419.22]  today,
[4419.22 --> 4419.90]  here,
[4420.26 --> 4421.06]  think that we will?
[4423.26 --> 4424.20]  Here's the thing.
[4425.24 --> 4426.68]  Even people,
[4426.88 --> 4429.12]  even people
[4429.12 --> 4430.74]  who come to church
[4430.74 --> 4432.12]  every week
[4432.12 --> 4433.12]  think
[4433.12 --> 4434.56]  that that means
[4434.56 --> 4436.22]  a mark in their favor
[4436.22 --> 4437.42]  and that they're doing good.
[4438.68 --> 4439.24]  Now, don't hear
[4439.24 --> 4439.82]  what I'm not saying.
[4439.92 --> 4440.02]  Right?
[4440.04 --> 4440.44]  I'm not saying
[4440.44 --> 4441.20]  don't come to church.
[4442.10 --> 4443.14]  If you heard that,
[4443.36 --> 4444.16]  you missed it.
[4445.40 --> 4445.86]  Right?
[4445.86 --> 4446.48]  I'm saying
[4446.48 --> 4447.44]  you come to church
[4447.44 --> 4448.52]  because you've been
[4448.52 --> 4449.80]  regenerated and have faith.
[4449.98 --> 4451.64]  Not to check some box.
[4452.36 --> 4452.98]  Because here's how
[4452.98 --> 4453.84]  that works in our minds.
[4453.92 --> 4454.02]  Right?
[4454.14 --> 4454.92]  How many times
[4454.92 --> 4456.04]  have you come to church
[4456.04 --> 4457.08]  as an attempt
[4457.08 --> 4458.88]  to balance the scales
[4458.88 --> 4459.72]  of obedience
[4459.72 --> 4460.82]  and disobedience
[4460.82 --> 4461.84]  in your own life?
[4461.84 --> 4465.40]  You know,
[4465.50 --> 4467.08]  I slipped up
[4467.08 --> 4467.90]  on Tuesday night.
[4468.30 --> 4469.32]  I watched a little bit
[4469.32 --> 4469.70]  of porn.
[4470.16 --> 4470.90]  Better go to church
[4470.90 --> 4471.42]  on Sunday
[4471.42 --> 4472.30]  to make sure
[4472.30 --> 4472.84]  that the ledger
[4472.84 --> 4473.30]  is equal.
[4475.50 --> 4476.58]  And I got angry
[4476.58 --> 4477.84]  and I swore
[4477.84 --> 4478.60]  at that driver
[4478.60 --> 4479.48]  who was on the
[4479.48 --> 4480.02]  Fraser Highway
[4480.02 --> 4481.40]  going 15 kilometers
[4481.40 --> 4482.36]  under the speed limit.
[4483.24 --> 4484.22]  15 kilometers!
[4484.82 --> 4485.82]  Wasn't even a construction
[4485.82 --> 4486.18]  zone.
[4486.54 --> 4487.22]  They deserved it.
[4487.22 --> 4487.66]  But,
[4487.90 --> 4489.82]  I better pray a little
[4489.82 --> 4491.38]  just to make sure
[4491.38 --> 4492.18]  it's okay with God.
[4494.28 --> 4495.10]  And I'm not really
[4495.10 --> 4495.66]  stealing
[4495.66 --> 4497.06]  when I don't report
[4497.06 --> 4497.80]  all the tips
[4497.80 --> 4498.68]  that I get at work
[4498.68 --> 4499.40]  to my boss
[4499.40 --> 4500.98]  for the shared tip pool.
[4501.30 --> 4501.78]  Besides,
[4502.02 --> 4502.34]  you know what?
[4502.38 --> 4502.78]  This weekend
[4502.78 --> 4503.38]  I'm volunteering
[4503.38 --> 4504.16]  at Youth Coffee
[4504.16 --> 4505.40]  so it's okay.
[4505.48 --> 4506.16]  It washes out.
[4509.28 --> 4510.52]  We do that
[4510.52 --> 4512.70]  and that kind
[4512.70 --> 4513.40]  of thinking,
[4513.80 --> 4514.66]  whatever form
[4514.66 --> 4515.38]  it takes
[4515.38 --> 4516.98]  in your life
[4516.98 --> 4518.32]  is a version
[4518.32 --> 4520.22]  of Israel's thinking
[4520.22 --> 4520.98]  when they,
[4521.10 --> 4521.68]  what did Paul say,
[4521.80 --> 4522.88]  pursued righteousness
[4522.88 --> 4523.80]  not by faith
[4523.80 --> 4524.60]  but as if it were
[4524.60 --> 4525.16]  by works
[4525.16 --> 4526.52]  and they have not
[4526.52 --> 4528.36]  attained their goal.
[4529.96 --> 4531.48]  If you believe
[4531.48 --> 4532.72]  or say you are
[4532.72 --> 4533.22]  a Christian
[4533.22 --> 4534.14]  but don't do
[4534.14 --> 4535.18]  the kinds of things
[4535.18 --> 4536.32]  Christians are called
[4536.32 --> 4536.92]  to do
[4536.92 --> 4539.04]  or don't
[4539.04 --> 4540.82]  reject
[4540.82 --> 4542.10]  completely
[4542.10 --> 4543.24]  the kinds of things
[4543.24 --> 4543.82]  that Jesus
[4543.82 --> 4545.28]  would reject
[4545.28 --> 4546.58]  that tells me
[4546.58 --> 4547.54]  that you think
[4547.54 --> 4548.48]  being a Christian
[4548.48 --> 4549.62]  is no different
[4549.62 --> 4550.28]  than the people
[4550.28 --> 4551.00]  of Israel
[4551.00 --> 4551.90]  thought about
[4551.90 --> 4552.66]  being a descendant
[4552.66 --> 4553.20]  of Abraham.
[4555.20 --> 4556.16]  And they missed
[4556.16 --> 4556.68]  Jesus.
[4557.68 --> 4558.54]  They missed
[4558.54 --> 4559.68]  Jesus.
[4562.76 --> 4563.14]  And so
[4563.14 --> 4566.60]  stop
[4566.60 --> 4568.16]  presuming
[4568.16 --> 4569.62]  and start
[4569.62 --> 4570.86]  pursuing.
[4572.44 --> 4573.84]  Verse 32
[4573.84 --> 4577.06]  to the last bit
[4577.06 --> 4578.96]  Paul says
[4578.96 --> 4580.14]  they stumbled
[4580.14 --> 4580.94]  over
[4580.94 --> 4582.82]  the stumbling stone
[4582.82 --> 4584.50]  and then he quotes
[4584.50 --> 4585.10]  Isaiah.
[4585.70 --> 4586.42]  Now Isaiah
[4586.42 --> 4587.68]  in what we have
[4587.68 --> 4588.40]  as verse 33
[4588.40 --> 4590.34]  is very clearly
[4590.34 --> 4591.38]  talking about
[4591.38 --> 4592.18]  Jesus.
[4593.38 --> 4593.90]  Jesus
[4593.90 --> 4595.64]  is the stone
[4595.64 --> 4596.84]  that they stumbled
[4596.84 --> 4597.30]  over.
[4598.72 --> 4599.58]  And if you
[4599.58 --> 4600.16]  think,
[4600.30 --> 4600.90]  sitting here,
[4601.06 --> 4601.76]  think that doing
[4601.76 --> 4602.80]  a couple of good
[4602.80 --> 4604.12]  things is enough
[4604.12 --> 4605.24]  or if you think
[4605.24 --> 4606.44]  that you can be
[4606.44 --> 4607.08]  a Christian
[4607.08 --> 4608.44]  without Christ,
[4609.00 --> 4609.28]  I mean,
[4609.36 --> 4610.24]  it's in the name
[4610.24 --> 4611.02]  and yet we still
[4611.02 --> 4611.52]  think it,
[4611.78 --> 4612.46]  if you think
[4612.46 --> 4613.20]  you can be a Christian
[4613.20 --> 4613.82]  without Christ,
[4613.94 --> 4614.72]  you've missed
[4614.72 --> 4615.80]  Jesus and you're
[4615.80 --> 4616.54]  stumbling over
[4616.54 --> 4617.48]  the same stone
[4617.48 --> 4618.26]  that they did.
[4619.36 --> 4620.50]  And if that's you,
[4620.74 --> 4621.56]  that means
[4621.56 --> 4622.20]  the faith
[4622.20 --> 4622.88]  that you are
[4622.88 --> 4623.48]  professing,
[4623.58 --> 4624.20]  whatever form
[4624.20 --> 4624.84]  it might take
[4624.84 --> 4625.54]  or words you might
[4625.54 --> 4626.12]  put to it,
[4626.44 --> 4627.48]  isn't faith
[4627.48 --> 4628.70]  from regeneration.
[4628.70 --> 4631.06]  At least,
[4631.56 --> 4632.10]  and I pray
[4632.10 --> 4632.66]  this is true,
[4633.20 --> 4634.08]  it isn't yet
[4634.08 --> 4635.38]  faith
[4635.38 --> 4636.46]  from regeneration.
[4639.94 --> 4640.42]  Because
[4640.42 --> 4643.14]  if you have the ears
[4643.14 --> 4643.84]  to hear it
[4643.84 --> 4644.96]  and the heart
[4644.96 --> 4646.20]  to see it,
[4646.86 --> 4648.02]  this is
[4648.02 --> 4648.80]  Paul
[4648.80 --> 4649.98]  pleading
[4649.98 --> 4651.22]  for his brothers
[4651.22 --> 4651.88]  and sisters.
[4653.28 --> 4653.98]  And I hope
[4653.98 --> 4654.66]  you hear it too
[4654.66 --> 4655.66]  because this is me
[4655.66 --> 4656.26]  now standing
[4656.26 --> 4656.76]  in front of you
[4656.76 --> 4657.20]  begging,
[4657.20 --> 4658.98]  hear God.
[4659.32 --> 4660.08]  This is God
[4660.08 --> 4661.24]  calling to you
[4661.24 --> 4661.52]  now.
[4661.90 --> 4663.42]  Here's Paul's heart,
[4663.54 --> 4664.90]  verse 1 to 3
[4664.90 --> 4666.24]  in chapter 10.
[4667.14 --> 4668.38]  Hear him plead
[4668.38 --> 4669.36]  and hear him
[4669.36 --> 4669.98]  beg with them
[4669.98 --> 4670.78]  to hear
[4670.78 --> 4671.38]  and to listen.
[4671.74 --> 4672.02]  He says,
[4672.34 --> 4673.54]  brothers and sisters,
[4674.20 --> 4675.18]  my heart's
[4675.18 --> 4676.10]  desire
[4676.10 --> 4677.20]  and prayer
[4677.20 --> 4678.08]  to God
[4678.08 --> 4679.60]  for the Israelites
[4679.60 --> 4680.58]  is that
[4680.58 --> 4681.48]  they may
[4681.48 --> 4682.10]  be
[4682.10 --> 4683.06]  saved.
[4684.20 --> 4684.92]  For I could
[4684.92 --> 4685.44]  testify
[4685.44 --> 4686.56]  about them
[4686.56 --> 4686.92]  that they
[4686.92 --> 4687.58]  are zealous
[4687.58 --> 4688.26]  for God
[4688.26 --> 4688.90]  but their
[4688.90 --> 4689.26]  zeal
[4689.26 --> 4689.60]  is not
[4689.60 --> 4690.24]  based on
[4690.24 --> 4690.82]  knowledge.
[4692.12 --> 4692.78]  Since they
[4692.78 --> 4693.22]  did not
[4693.22 --> 4693.62]  know the
[4693.62 --> 4694.10]  righteousness
[4694.10 --> 4694.78]  of God
[4694.78 --> 4695.14]  and sought
[4695.14 --> 4695.84]  to establish
[4695.84 --> 4696.64]  their own,
[4696.76 --> 4697.08]  they did
[4697.08 --> 4698.28]  not submit
[4698.28 --> 4699.40]  to God's
[4699.40 --> 4700.60]  righteousness.
[4701.94 --> 4703.48]  Paul pleads
[4703.48 --> 4704.34]  for these
[4704.34 --> 4704.80]  people.
[4705.44 --> 4706.18]  He prays
[4706.18 --> 4706.68]  for them.
[4707.68 --> 4707.96]  And can I
[4707.96 --> 4708.36]  just say that
[4708.36 --> 4709.16]  if you
[4709.16 --> 4711.68]  know someone
[4711.68 --> 4712.24]  who doesn't
[4712.24 --> 4713.10]  know Jesus,
[4714.66 --> 4715.58]  pray for them.
[4716.56 --> 4717.60]  pray for them.
[4718.50 --> 4719.16]  As we
[4719.16 --> 4720.22]  wrestle together
[4720.22 --> 4720.96]  in this time
[4720.96 --> 4721.88]  with the
[4721.88 --> 4722.88]  mystery of
[4722.88 --> 4723.46]  the sovereignty
[4723.46 --> 4724.06]  of God
[4724.06 --> 4724.64]  and of human
[4724.64 --> 4725.48]  responsibility,
[4726.08 --> 4726.78]  Paul is
[4726.78 --> 4727.72]  modeling for us
[4727.72 --> 4728.58]  what some of
[4728.58 --> 4729.38]  that responsibility
[4729.38 --> 4730.76]  looks like.
[4731.54 --> 4731.90]  Pray.
[4732.66 --> 4733.54]  Pray for your
[4733.54 --> 4734.50]  sons and daughters.
[4734.90 --> 4735.46]  Pray for your
[4735.46 --> 4736.24]  friends and
[4736.24 --> 4736.58]  neighbors.
[4736.80 --> 4737.36]  Pray for their
[4737.36 --> 4737.86]  conversion.
[4738.12 --> 4738.72]  Pray for their
[4738.72 --> 4739.40]  regeneration.
[4739.92 --> 4740.24]  Pray.
[4740.60 --> 4741.74]  Over and over
[4741.74 --> 4742.42]  and over again
[4742.42 --> 4742.98]  in the Bible,
[4742.98 --> 4744.06]  it is confirmed
[4744.06 --> 4744.82]  with this
[4744.82 --> 4745.64]  truth that
[4745.64 --> 4746.68]  our sovereign
[4746.68 --> 4747.54]  God has
[4747.54 --> 4748.66]  ordained that
[4748.66 --> 4749.40]  the prayers
[4749.40 --> 4750.98]  of the saints
[4750.98 --> 4752.24]  shape history
[4752.24 --> 4753.08]  and change
[4753.08 --> 4753.52]  lives.
[4754.70 --> 4755.28]  Whether it's
[4755.28 --> 4756.22]  Daniel's prayer
[4756.22 --> 4757.08]  of repentance
[4757.08 --> 4758.06]  for the whole
[4758.06 --> 4758.82]  nation of Israel
[4758.82 --> 4759.38]  while they were
[4759.38 --> 4760.12]  still in exile
[4760.12 --> 4761.00]  that moves God
[4761.00 --> 4762.14]  to release them
[4762.14 --> 4762.50]  even though he
[4762.50 --> 4763.12]  had foreordained
[4763.12 --> 4763.80]  it years before,
[4763.92 --> 4764.50]  the prayer was
[4764.50 --> 4765.62]  still necessary.
[4766.14 --> 4766.76]  Whether it's
[4766.76 --> 4767.54]  Ezra's prayer
[4767.54 --> 4768.24]  of confession
[4768.24 --> 4768.96]  and the people's
[4768.96 --> 4769.90]  promise in response
[4769.90 --> 4770.60]  to the building
[4770.60 --> 4771.16]  of the temple
[4771.16 --> 4771.84]  and the rebuilding
[4771.84 --> 4772.92]  of Jerusalem.
[4774.20 --> 4775.62]  A motivation
[4775.62 --> 4776.24]  of heart
[4776.24 --> 4777.66]  that was necessary
[4777.66 --> 4778.70]  for that to happen.
[4778.78 --> 4779.52]  Or if it's Paul
[4779.52 --> 4780.58]  praying with
[4780.58 --> 4781.18]  thanksgiving
[4781.18 --> 4781.98]  for the church
[4781.98 --> 4782.88]  in Philippi
[4782.88 --> 4783.96]  calling them
[4783.96 --> 4784.64]  to be faithful
[4784.64 --> 4785.26]  and joyful
[4785.26 --> 4786.38]  even though
[4786.38 --> 4787.62]  he is in chains
[4787.62 --> 4788.54]  and they might
[4788.54 --> 4789.28]  face suffering.
[4790.48 --> 4791.84]  Or if it's Jesus
[4791.84 --> 4793.82]  praying for the church
[4793.82 --> 4796.06]  even as the world
[4796.06 --> 4798.34]  hates the disciples,
[4799.12 --> 4799.70]  Jesus says,
[4799.90 --> 4800.26]  but you,
[4800.26 --> 4801.48]  you must be
[4801.48 --> 4802.40]  one.
[4803.84 --> 4805.02]  Prayer changes
[4805.02 --> 4805.88]  hearts.
[4806.32 --> 4807.34]  Prayer changes
[4807.34 --> 4808.24]  history.
[4808.44 --> 4809.02]  And so,
[4809.50 --> 4809.78]  pray.
[4810.46 --> 4811.44]  If you don't know
[4811.44 --> 4812.42]  what your responsibility
[4812.42 --> 4814.20]  is in salvation,
[4814.70 --> 4814.96]  pray.
[4816.18 --> 4817.34]  That's what it is.
[4817.88 --> 4818.22]  Or at least
[4818.22 --> 4818.94]  that's where it starts.
[4821.24 --> 4822.94]  A couple weeks ago
[4822.94 --> 4823.66]  I had the chance
[4823.66 --> 4825.86]  to go to
[4825.86 --> 4827.68]  a bit of a conference,
[4827.76 --> 4828.54]  a day event
[4828.54 --> 4830.72]  put on by
[4830.72 --> 4831.58]  Power to Change.
[4831.80 --> 4833.30]  And there was
[4833.30 --> 4834.00]  a bunch of
[4834.00 --> 4834.92]  leaders,
[4835.40 --> 4836.28]  church leaders
[4836.28 --> 4837.52]  and business leaders,
[4837.72 --> 4838.64]  Christian thought leaders
[4838.64 --> 4839.84]  who were gathered together
[4839.84 --> 4841.72]  to begin wondering,
[4842.10 --> 4842.40]  thinking,
[4842.64 --> 4843.62]  dreaming about
[4843.62 --> 4844.60]  what might God
[4844.60 --> 4845.22]  be doing
[4845.22 --> 4846.26]  in this time,
[4846.42 --> 4847.24]  in this age,
[4847.30 --> 4848.74]  in this context.
[4848.74 --> 4850.30]  And one of the speakers
[4850.30 --> 4851.16]  was a woman
[4851.16 --> 4851.74]  named
[4851.74 --> 4853.10]  Shayla Visser.
[4853.66 --> 4854.86]  Shayla is the director
[4854.86 --> 4856.42]  of Alpha Canada.
[4857.76 --> 4859.16]  And she said something
[4859.16 --> 4861.34]  that convicted me
[4861.34 --> 4862.22]  to the core
[4862.22 --> 4862.80]  in that moment.
[4862.88 --> 4863.38]  And I've shared it
[4863.38 --> 4863.88]  with some of you.
[4864.86 --> 4865.56]  She said,
[4866.22 --> 4868.38]  churches often ask me
[4868.38 --> 4869.10]  to come
[4869.10 --> 4870.48]  and to talk to them
[4870.48 --> 4871.82]  about how they can be
[4871.82 --> 4872.72]  more missional,
[4873.12 --> 4874.02]  about how they can be
[4874.02 --> 4875.02]  more on mission
[4875.02 --> 4876.60]  making new disciples.
[4876.60 --> 4876.72]  disciples.
[4877.28 --> 4879.00]  And my first question
[4879.00 --> 4879.44]  to them
[4879.44 --> 4880.82]  always is,
[4881.52 --> 4882.92]  how does your church
[4882.92 --> 4883.56]  pray?
[4888.76 --> 4890.00]  How does your church
[4890.00 --> 4890.32]  pray?
[4890.86 --> 4891.70]  How do you
[4891.70 --> 4892.58]  pray?
[4892.68 --> 4893.30]  How do we
[4893.30 --> 4894.30]  pray
[4894.30 --> 4896.32]  for this?
[4896.32 --> 4901.12]  So let's come back
[4901.12 --> 4902.52]  now to the beginning.
[4902.68 --> 4903.56]  I have been wondering
[4903.56 --> 4904.74]  lately if,
[4905.70 --> 4906.56]  as Christians,
[4906.80 --> 4908.92]  in our 21st century
[4908.92 --> 4910.46]  Canadian context,
[4911.06 --> 4912.60]  if we have settled
[4912.60 --> 4914.28]  for a vaguely
[4914.28 --> 4915.66]  Christian morality
[4915.66 --> 4917.38]  rather than
[4917.38 --> 4918.30]  a deeply
[4918.30 --> 4920.54]  spirit-filled,
[4921.12 --> 4922.60]  transformed life.
[4922.60 --> 4924.90]  right?
[4924.96 --> 4925.72]  If society
[4925.72 --> 4926.30]  acts
[4926.30 --> 4927.32]  Christianly,
[4927.56 --> 4929.42]  then we're just
[4929.42 --> 4930.10]  not concerned
[4930.10 --> 4931.44]  with regeneration
[4931.44 --> 4933.30]  because acting
[4933.30 --> 4933.84]  Christian
[4933.84 --> 4934.70]  is enough
[4934.70 --> 4936.36]  or so we have
[4936.36 --> 4937.56]  come to believe
[4937.56 --> 4938.58]  or at least
[4938.58 --> 4939.90]  function as.
[4941.18 --> 4941.38]  Right?
[4941.40 --> 4942.06]  If my kids
[4942.06 --> 4942.50]  obey
[4942.50 --> 4943.98]  and they don't
[4943.98 --> 4944.44]  get in trouble
[4944.44 --> 4945.20]  with their teachers
[4945.20 --> 4946.74]  or, you know,
[4946.78 --> 4947.32]  they don't get in trouble
[4947.32 --> 4947.90]  with the police,
[4948.66 --> 4950.16]  if they respect
[4950.16 --> 4951.12]  the lives
[4951.12 --> 4952.46]  of people
[4952.46 --> 4953.36]  around them
[4953.36 --> 4953.80]  and if they
[4953.80 --> 4954.98]  heed the authority
[4954.98 --> 4956.74]  of those over them,
[4956.86 --> 4957.60]  well, that's enough.
[4960.74 --> 4962.00]  But we've settled
[4962.00 --> 4964.96]  for an unchanged heart.
[4966.60 --> 4967.10]  Look,
[4968.16 --> 4971.64]  I believe this
[4971.64 --> 4973.06]  and I believe
[4973.06 --> 4974.04]  that you believe this
[4974.04 --> 4974.82]  or at least you want
[4974.82 --> 4975.72]  to believe this,
[4975.92 --> 4976.58]  but I believe
[4976.58 --> 4977.56]  that the gospel
[4977.56 --> 4978.78]  has the power
[4978.78 --> 4979.82]  to change lives.
[4979.82 --> 4981.22]  that the gospel
[4981.22 --> 4982.04]  has the power
[4982.04 --> 4983.84]  to transform people.
[4984.24 --> 4984.30]  Right?
[4984.32 --> 4985.22]  That murderers
[4985.22 --> 4986.32]  can become missionaries
[4986.32 --> 4987.44]  because we've seen it.
[4988.38 --> 4988.60]  Right?
[4988.62 --> 4989.22]  That addicts
[4989.22 --> 4989.90]  can become saved
[4989.90 --> 4990.36]  from addiction
[4990.36 --> 4991.36]  because we've seen it.
[4992.26 --> 4992.48]  Right?
[4992.50 --> 4993.18]  That desires
[4993.18 --> 4994.44]  can be transformed
[4994.44 --> 4995.90]  because we've seen it.
[4996.06 --> 4996.74]  We have seen
[4996.74 --> 4998.00]  spiritually dead people
[4998.00 --> 4999.24]  raised to newness
[4999.24 --> 4999.56]  of life.
[4999.66 --> 5000.22]  I believe
[5000.22 --> 5000.70]  that God
[5000.70 --> 5001.46]  can do that
[5001.46 --> 5002.94]  and is still doing that
[5002.94 --> 5003.90]  and will continue
[5003.90 --> 5004.58]  to do that.
[5004.76 --> 5005.88]  You better say amen.
[5007.42 --> 5008.36]  Come on, guys.
[5008.36 --> 5011.96]  This is that moment.
[5013.38 --> 5014.52]  This is that moment.
[5015.90 --> 5016.86]  Dead people
[5016.86 --> 5017.94]  can be raised
[5017.94 --> 5018.78]  to life.
[5019.06 --> 5019.86]  God still
[5019.86 --> 5020.74]  does that.
[5024.26 --> 5024.90]  Christ
[5024.90 --> 5027.00]  is the culmination
[5027.00 --> 5028.38]  of the law
[5028.38 --> 5029.42]  so that there might
[5029.42 --> 5030.38]  be righteousness
[5030.38 --> 5031.60]  for everyone
[5031.60 --> 5033.44]  who believes.
[5035.76 --> 5036.84]  That's the goal.
[5036.84 --> 5041.20]  and what culture
[5041.20 --> 5042.48]  tries to do
[5042.48 --> 5043.42]  with political
[5043.42 --> 5044.28]  correctness
[5044.28 --> 5045.84]  or niceness.
[5047.14 --> 5047.24]  Right?
[5047.62 --> 5048.74]  What the left
[5048.74 --> 5049.60]  tries to do
[5049.60 --> 5050.44]  with wokeness
[5050.44 --> 5051.28]  and what the right
[5051.28 --> 5052.02]  tries to do
[5052.02 --> 5052.84]  with legalism.
[5053.14 --> 5053.88]  Now hear me very clearly.
[5053.96 --> 5054.56]  I'm cutting right down
[5054.56 --> 5055.32]  the middle on this one.
[5056.06 --> 5057.10]  What progressives
[5057.10 --> 5057.60]  try to do
[5057.60 --> 5058.18]  with tolerance
[5058.18 --> 5059.18]  and what conservatives
[5059.18 --> 5059.72]  try to do
[5059.72 --> 5060.50]  with legislation.
[5062.50 --> 5062.62]  Right?
[5062.68 --> 5063.88]  When each one
[5063.88 --> 5064.68]  of these people
[5064.68 --> 5065.66]  and these perspectives
[5065.66 --> 5067.24]  say something like
[5067.24 --> 5068.12]  if we all just
[5068.12 --> 5068.98]  did it this way
[5068.98 --> 5070.08]  life and the world
[5070.08 --> 5071.08]  would be good.
[5071.54 --> 5072.58]  All of that
[5072.58 --> 5073.70]  is a substitute
[5073.70 --> 5075.12]  for what only Christ
[5075.12 --> 5075.68]  can give.
[5077.88 --> 5078.44]  Righteousness
[5078.44 --> 5080.26]  for everyone
[5080.26 --> 5081.80]  who believes.
[5081.80 --> 5085.38]  and look
[5085.38 --> 5089.76]  I'm mindful
[5089.76 --> 5090.28]  of our time
[5090.28 --> 5092.28]  but this is
[5092.28 --> 5093.22]  magnificence
[5093.22 --> 5094.26]  and so I'm going
[5094.26 --> 5095.00]  to read it all again
[5095.00 --> 5096.86]  and hear it.
[5097.18 --> 5097.74]  Hear it.
[5099.22 --> 5099.74]  Moses
[5099.74 --> 5101.06]  verse 5
[5101.06 --> 5102.80]  writes about this
[5102.80 --> 5103.66]  about this
[5103.66 --> 5104.46]  writes this
[5104.46 --> 5105.30]  about the righteousness
[5105.30 --> 5106.92]  that is by the law.
[5107.48 --> 5107.94]  The person
[5107.94 --> 5108.94]  who does these things
[5108.94 --> 5109.60]  will live
[5109.60 --> 5110.30]  by them
[5110.30 --> 5112.04]  but the righteousness
[5112.04 --> 5113.48]  that is by faith
[5113.48 --> 5114.08]  says
[5114.08 --> 5115.20]  do not say
[5115.20 --> 5115.78]  in your heart
[5115.78 --> 5116.46]  who will ascend
[5116.46 --> 5116.96]  into heaven
[5116.96 --> 5117.58]  that is to bring
[5117.58 --> 5118.14]  Christ down
[5118.14 --> 5119.18]  or who will descend
[5119.18 --> 5119.74]  into the deep
[5119.74 --> 5120.26]  that is to bring
[5120.26 --> 5121.20]  Christ up from the dead
[5121.20 --> 5122.96]  but what does it say?
[5124.04 --> 5124.88]  So the righteousness
[5124.88 --> 5125.90]  that is by faith
[5125.90 --> 5126.54]  says
[5126.54 --> 5128.72]  the word is near you
[5128.72 --> 5129.98]  it is in your mouth
[5129.98 --> 5130.94]  and in your heart.
[5131.40 --> 5132.58]  That is the message
[5132.58 --> 5133.46]  concerning faith
[5133.46 --> 5134.20]  that we proclaim.
[5134.84 --> 5135.68]  If you declare
[5135.68 --> 5136.42]  with your mouth
[5136.42 --> 5137.46]  Jesus is Lord
[5137.46 --> 5138.88]  and believe in your heart
[5138.88 --> 5139.84]  that God raised him
[5139.84 --> 5140.42]  from the dead
[5140.42 --> 5142.36]  you will be saved.
[5143.88 --> 5145.06]  For it is with your heart
[5145.06 --> 5145.76]  that you believe
[5145.76 --> 5146.56]  and are justified
[5146.56 --> 5147.80]  and it is with your mouth
[5147.80 --> 5148.76]  that you profess
[5148.76 --> 5149.40]  your faith
[5149.40 --> 5150.42]  and are saved.
[5150.62 --> 5151.72]  As scripture says
[5151.72 --> 5153.16]  anyone who believes
[5153.16 --> 5153.66]  in him
[5153.66 --> 5155.16]  will never be put
[5155.16 --> 5155.78]  to shame
[5155.78 --> 5157.54]  for there is no difference
[5157.54 --> 5158.26]  between Jew
[5158.26 --> 5159.14]  and Gentile
[5159.14 --> 5160.46]  the same Lord
[5160.46 --> 5161.72]  is Lord of all
[5161.72 --> 5162.92]  and richly blesses
[5162.92 --> 5164.26]  all who call on him
[5164.26 --> 5165.60]  for everyone
[5165.60 --> 5167.12]  who calls on the name
[5167.12 --> 5168.18]  of the Lord
[5168.18 --> 5170.88]  will be saved.
[5176.32 --> 5179.50]  The heart of God.
[5181.68 --> 5182.92]  But did you hear it?
[5185.42 --> 5187.38]  Regeneration precedes faith.
[5187.48 --> 5188.12]  In order for you
[5188.12 --> 5188.82]  to have faith
[5188.82 --> 5189.44]  to believe
[5189.44 --> 5190.38]  you must be born
[5190.38 --> 5192.02]  of faith.
[5192.22 --> 5192.86]  And so
[5192.86 --> 5194.30]  what do you do with that?
[5194.30 --> 5196.06]  What is our responsibility
[5196.06 --> 5197.02]  as we see
[5197.02 --> 5197.98]  what God has done
[5197.98 --> 5198.38]  Christ
[5198.38 --> 5199.10]  the culmination
[5199.10 --> 5199.58]  of the law
[5199.58 --> 5200.18]  so that there might
[5200.18 --> 5200.72]  be righteousness
[5200.72 --> 5201.76]  for everyone
[5201.76 --> 5202.60]  who believes.
[5202.72 --> 5203.56]  What is your
[5203.56 --> 5204.24]  responsibility
[5204.24 --> 5205.16]  now?
[5206.76 --> 5207.80]  Verse 9 says
[5207.80 --> 5208.78]  if you declare
[5208.78 --> 5210.48]  right
[5210.48 --> 5211.86]  verse 9 continues
[5211.86 --> 5212.78]  and believe
[5212.78 --> 5213.84]  or verse 10
[5213.84 --> 5214.66]  for it is with your heart
[5214.66 --> 5215.42]  that you believe
[5215.42 --> 5216.74]  and it is with your mouth
[5216.74 --> 5218.06]  that you profess.
[5219.06 --> 5219.18]  Right
[5219.18 --> 5219.80]  declare
[5219.80 --> 5221.36]  believe
[5221.36 --> 5222.40]  profess
[5222.40 --> 5223.18]  right
[5223.18 --> 5224.20]  verse 12
[5224.20 --> 5226.58]  call on the name
[5226.58 --> 5227.76]  of
[5227.76 --> 5229.04]  the Lord.
[5230.68 --> 5231.76]  These are the acts
[5231.76 --> 5232.34]  of faith
[5232.34 --> 5233.48]  that you're invited
[5233.48 --> 5233.90]  to do
[5233.90 --> 5234.94]  and to participate in
[5234.94 --> 5235.24]  right
[5235.24 --> 5235.80]  to declare
[5235.80 --> 5236.52]  and to believe
[5236.52 --> 5237.14]  and to profess
[5237.14 --> 5237.82]  and to call
[5237.82 --> 5238.42]  on the name
[5238.42 --> 5239.16]  of the Lord.
[5239.54 --> 5240.02]  These
[5240.02 --> 5240.94]  are the acts
[5240.94 --> 5242.14]  of response
[5242.14 --> 5243.50]  to regeneration
[5243.50 --> 5244.22]  right
[5244.22 --> 5244.90]  you're declaring
[5244.90 --> 5245.62]  you're believing
[5245.62 --> 5246.44]  you're professing
[5246.44 --> 5247.02]  you're calling
[5247.02 --> 5248.04]  on the name
[5248.04 --> 5248.84]  of the Lord
[5248.84 --> 5250.62]  doesn't save
[5250.62 --> 5251.06]  you
[5251.06 --> 5252.26]  you do them
[5252.26 --> 5253.44]  because you have
[5253.44 --> 5254.14]  been saved
[5254.14 --> 5254.74]  by the mercy
[5254.74 --> 5255.30]  of God
[5255.30 --> 5256.24]  you do them
[5256.24 --> 5256.76]  because you have
[5256.76 --> 5257.36]  received
[5257.36 --> 5259.16]  his mercy.
[5260.82 --> 5260.94]  Now
[5260.94 --> 5262.36]  I know where we're at
[5262.36 --> 5263.36]  but just one more
[5263.36 --> 5264.18]  one more please
[5264.18 --> 5264.96]  one more nerd
[5264.96 --> 5265.38]  moment
[5265.38 --> 5266.34]  with me.
[5267.44 --> 5268.36]  Verse 9 and 10
[5268.36 --> 5268.94]  look at them
[5268.94 --> 5269.90]  in your mind
[5269.90 --> 5270.76]  verse 9 and 10
[5270.76 --> 5272.36]  there are two
[5272.36 --> 5274.16]  super imposed
[5274.16 --> 5275.42]  orders
[5275.42 --> 5277.16]  on each other
[5277.16 --> 5279.24]  but you can't
[5279.24 --> 5279.94]  conflate them
[5279.94 --> 5280.54]  right
[5280.54 --> 5281.06]  there is the
[5281.06 --> 5282.26]  logical order
[5282.26 --> 5283.18]  of the decree
[5283.18 --> 5284.06]  of God
[5284.06 --> 5285.18]  which happens
[5285.18 --> 5285.98]  simultaneously
[5285.98 --> 5287.12]  and which was
[5287.12 --> 5288.02]  issued in eternity
[5288.02 --> 5288.68]  past
[5288.68 --> 5289.48]  in the mind
[5289.48 --> 5289.98]  of God
[5289.98 --> 5291.22]  and there's
[5291.22 --> 5292.14]  the historical
[5292.14 --> 5293.68]  chronological order
[5293.68 --> 5295.02]  of that decree
[5295.02 --> 5296.04]  being worked out
[5296.04 --> 5296.64]  in history.
[5297.76 --> 5299.12]  Both are true
[5299.12 --> 5301.22]  without the first
[5301.22 --> 5301.94]  the second
[5301.94 --> 5302.52]  wouldn't or
[5302.52 --> 5303.20]  couldn't occur
[5303.20 --> 5304.90]  but if you are
[5304.90 --> 5305.80]  doing the second
[5305.80 --> 5306.50]  that is if you are
[5306.50 --> 5307.74]  declaring and professing
[5307.74 --> 5308.20]  and believing
[5308.20 --> 5308.92]  and calling on the
[5308.92 --> 5309.42]  name of the Lord
[5309.42 --> 5310.92]  then the first
[5310.92 --> 5311.72]  has occurred
[5311.72 --> 5315.38]  and so I'll say it again
[5315.38 --> 5316.86]  declare
[5316.86 --> 5317.66]  believe
[5317.66 --> 5318.20]  profess
[5318.20 --> 5319.32]  call on the name
[5319.32 --> 5319.74]  of the Lord
[5319.74 --> 5320.60]  and do it
[5320.60 --> 5321.86]  with confidence
[5321.86 --> 5322.72]  because
[5322.72 --> 5324.44]  there is no difference
[5324.44 --> 5325.04]  between Jew
[5325.04 --> 5325.68]  and Gentile
[5325.68 --> 5326.52]  that means we all
[5326.52 --> 5327.26]  are up in here
[5327.26 --> 5328.24]  receiving the mercy
[5328.24 --> 5328.78]  of God
[5328.78 --> 5329.84]  and the same
[5329.84 --> 5330.76]  Lord is Lord
[5330.76 --> 5331.20]  of all
[5331.20 --> 5331.92]  and richly
[5331.92 --> 5332.80]  blesses all
[5332.80 --> 5333.82]  who call on him
[5333.82 --> 5334.96]  for whoever
[5334.96 --> 5335.86]  or everyone
[5335.86 --> 5336.60]  who calls
[5336.60 --> 5337.20]  on the name
[5337.20 --> 5338.10]  of the Lord
[5338.10 --> 5340.32]  will be saved
[5340.32 --> 5341.82]  that is your guarantee
[5341.82 --> 5345.68]  and so I ask
[5345.68 --> 5348.16]  some of you might call this
[5348.16 --> 5348.94]  an altar call moment
[5348.94 --> 5349.76]  but so I ask
[5349.76 --> 5351.70]  are you doing these things
[5351.70 --> 5354.64]  and if not
[5354.64 --> 5357.22]  what might that mean
[5357.22 --> 5360.68]  because it might mean
[5360.68 --> 5361.90]  that you have
[5361.90 --> 5362.86]  substituted
[5362.86 --> 5363.64]  a vaguely
[5363.64 --> 5365.00]  Christian morality
[5365.00 --> 5365.86]  in place
[5365.86 --> 5366.52]  of a spirit
[5366.52 --> 5367.60]  filled life
[5367.60 --> 5369.44]  it might mean
[5369.44 --> 5370.12]  that you are making
[5370.12 --> 5370.92]  the same mistake
[5370.92 --> 5371.42]  as Israel
[5371.42 --> 5372.34]  and missing
[5372.34 --> 5373.16]  Jesus
[5373.16 --> 5374.78]  it might mean
[5374.78 --> 5375.68]  that you are missing
[5375.68 --> 5376.58]  on the full
[5376.58 --> 5377.90]  life transforming
[5377.90 --> 5378.52]  power
[5378.52 --> 5379.80]  of the Holy Spirit
[5379.80 --> 5380.88]  and of the gospel
[5380.88 --> 5381.82]  and that you are
[5381.82 --> 5382.76]  settling for
[5382.76 --> 5383.50]  niceness
[5383.50 --> 5384.22]  or for
[5384.22 --> 5385.06]  legalism
[5385.06 --> 5387.92]  but if you are
[5387.92 --> 5388.92]  doing these things
[5388.92 --> 5391.26]  if you do see this
[5391.26 --> 5392.10]  in your life
[5392.10 --> 5395.28]  it might mean
[5395.28 --> 5396.62]  and I pray that it does
[5396.62 --> 5397.90]  that regeneration
[5397.90 --> 5399.02]  has occurred
[5399.02 --> 5400.08]  it might mean
[5400.08 --> 5400.72]  that you can
[5400.72 --> 5401.76]  actually have
[5401.76 --> 5402.56]  real
[5402.56 --> 5404.30]  world changing
[5404.30 --> 5405.18]  confidence
[5405.18 --> 5405.92]  that anyone
[5405.92 --> 5406.70]  who believes in him
[5406.70 --> 5407.72]  will never be put to shame
[5407.72 --> 5409.04]  that's our confidence
[5409.04 --> 5410.32]  that everyone
[5410.32 --> 5411.22]  who calls on the name
[5411.22 --> 5411.74]  of the Lord
[5411.74 --> 5412.78]  will be saved
[5412.78 --> 5415.92]  that is the gospel
[5415.92 --> 5416.60]  truth
[5416.60 --> 5418.80]  precisely because
[5418.80 --> 5419.78]  regeneration
[5419.78 --> 5421.54]  precedes faith
[5421.54 --> 5423.02]  and I will end
[5423.02 --> 5423.78]  here
[5423.78 --> 5426.46]  I believe
[5426.46 --> 5428.58]  that what the church
[5428.58 --> 5429.94]  needs to grow
[5429.94 --> 5430.54]  young
[5430.54 --> 5432.36]  what the church
[5432.36 --> 5432.98]  needs
[5432.98 --> 5434.54]  to see
[5434.54 --> 5435.50]  a new generation
[5435.50 --> 5435.98]  of people
[5435.98 --> 5436.72]  rise up
[5436.72 --> 5437.38]  in faith
[5437.38 --> 5441.42]  is to live
[5441.42 --> 5443.92]  regenerate
[5443.92 --> 5445.08]  lives
[5445.08 --> 5447.66]  and to show
[5447.66 --> 5449.68]  everyone around you
[5449.68 --> 5451.58]  that God
[5451.58 --> 5452.34]  has raised
[5452.34 --> 5452.92]  you
[5452.92 --> 5454.08]  from
[5454.08 --> 5455.20]  death
[5455.20 --> 5457.08]  that he has
[5457.08 --> 5457.76]  given you
[5457.76 --> 5458.64]  life
[5458.64 --> 5459.50]  and that
[5459.50 --> 5460.72]  my friends
[5460.72 --> 5461.86]  changes
[5461.86 --> 5463.30]  everything
[5463.30 --> 5465.28]  and that
[5465.28 --> 5466.68]  will change
[5466.68 --> 5467.62]  not only the church
[5467.62 --> 5468.78]  and this church
[5468.78 --> 5470.10]  but the world
[5470.10 --> 5471.14]  amen
[5471.14 --> 5473.20]  let's pray together
[5473.20 --> 5479.36]  holy God
[5479.36 --> 5482.70]  humbly
[5482.70 --> 5485.26]  we confess
[5485.26 --> 5486.84]  that we have
[5486.84 --> 5487.76]  substituted
[5487.76 --> 5489.06]  vague
[5489.06 --> 5489.96]  moralities
[5489.96 --> 5490.84]  for the gospel
[5490.84 --> 5492.96]  that we have
[5492.96 --> 5493.70]  substituted
[5493.70 --> 5494.26]  rules
[5494.26 --> 5494.86]  for the freedom
[5494.86 --> 5495.48]  of Christ
[5495.48 --> 5497.62]  that we have
[5497.62 --> 5499.04]  allowed
[5499.04 --> 5499.68]  ourselves
[5499.68 --> 5500.36]  to believe
[5500.36 --> 5501.02]  that we
[5501.02 --> 5501.92]  could balance
[5501.92 --> 5502.64]  the ledger
[5502.64 --> 5503.26]  of obedience
[5503.26 --> 5504.34]  to disobedience
[5504.34 --> 5507.60]  and so
[5507.60 --> 5509.36]  whether for the
[5509.36 --> 5510.16]  first time
[5510.16 --> 5511.42]  or whether
[5511.42 --> 5512.16]  this has been
[5512.16 --> 5512.88]  our journey
[5512.88 --> 5513.44]  of faith
[5513.44 --> 5514.44]  and sanctification
[5514.44 --> 5515.76]  transform
[5515.76 --> 5516.64]  us
[5516.64 --> 5517.56]  by the power
[5517.56 --> 5518.32]  of your gospel
[5518.32 --> 5520.14]  move in your spirit
[5520.14 --> 5521.26]  so that we
[5521.26 --> 5522.18]  might see
[5522.18 --> 5523.34]  more clearly
[5523.34 --> 5524.16]  what it means
[5524.16 --> 5524.94]  to be
[5524.94 --> 5525.96]  regenerated
[5525.96 --> 5526.88]  to be born again
[5526.88 --> 5527.98]  to be alive
[5527.98 --> 5529.52]  only by your power
[5529.52 --> 5530.76]  and to live
[5530.76 --> 5532.14]  that power
[5532.14 --> 5532.92]  in the world
[5532.92 --> 5533.74]  in meaningful
[5533.74 --> 5535.14]  and profound
[5535.14 --> 5536.38]  ways
[5536.38 --> 5538.96]  oh God
[5538.96 --> 5540.30]  use us
[5540.30 --> 5541.56]  to transform
[5541.56 --> 5542.10]  the world
[5542.10 --> 5542.36]  and
[5542.36 --> 5542.78]  and
[5542.78 --> 5544.32]  I pray
[5544.32 --> 5546.32]  that here
[5546.32 --> 5546.84]  at Emmanuel
[5546.84 --> 5548.04]  that would start
[5548.04 --> 5549.02]  with
[5549.02 --> 5550.00]  prayer
[5550.00 --> 5552.80]  and so we pray
[5552.80 --> 5554.08]  a commitment
[5554.08 --> 5555.46]  to pray
[5555.46 --> 5557.42]  and a commitment
[5557.42 --> 5558.00]  to go
[5558.00 --> 5558.98]  in prayer
[5558.98 --> 5559.98]  with you
[5559.98 --> 5562.46]  hear our prayer
[5562.46 --> 5563.08]  Lord Jesus
[5563.08 --> 5564.26]  and use them
[5564.26 --> 5564.98]  to act
[5564.98 --> 5566.72]  for your purposes
[5566.72 --> 5568.16]  in election
[5568.16 --> 5569.50]  and fill us
[5569.50 --> 5570.60]  with the confidence
[5570.60 --> 5571.64]  that everyone
[5571.64 --> 5572.40]  who calls
[5572.40 --> 5572.98]  on the name
[5572.98 --> 5573.64]  of the Lord
[5573.64 --> 5575.80]  will be saved
[5575.80 --> 5577.20]  in Jesus Christ
[5577.20 --> 5577.68]  we pray
[5577.68 --> 5578.76]  amen
[5578.76 --> 5603.14]  what is our hope
[5603.14 --> 5605.56]  in life and death
[5605.56 --> 5606.64]  Christ
[5606.64 --> 5607.20]  Christ alone
[5607.20 --> 5608.24]  Christ alone
[5608.24 --> 5610.12]  Christ alone
[5610.12 --> 5611.88]  what is our
[5611.88 --> 5614.48]  only confidence
[5614.48 --> 5617.92]  that our souls
[5617.92 --> 5620.02]  to him belong
[5620.02 --> 5622.92]  who holds our days
[5622.92 --> 5625.00]  within his hand
[5625.00 --> 5626.12]  what comes
[5626.12 --> 5626.70]  upon
[5626.70 --> 5629.12]  from his command
[5629.12 --> 5631.24]  and what will
[5631.24 --> 5632.88]  keep us
[5632.88 --> 5634.52]  to the end
[5634.52 --> 5637.26]  the love of Christ
[5637.26 --> 5640.62]  in which we stand
[5640.62 --> 5643.78]  O sing
[5643.78 --> 5646.26]  hallelujah
[5646.26 --> 5648.48]  our hope's
[5648.48 --> 5651.04]  praise eternal
[5651.04 --> 5655.42]  oh sing hallelujah
[5655.42 --> 5657.80]  now and heavenly
[5657.80 --> 5659.62]  confess
[5659.62 --> 5661.50]  Christ our hope
[5661.50 --> 5662.36]  in life
[5662.36 --> 5664.04]  and death
[5664.04 --> 5671.56]  the truth
