• The book of Job is one of the oldest books in the Bible and deals with theodicy, which is the question of how to understand evil in light of God.
• The classic argument against the existence of an all-powerful and good God is that if he exists, why is there evil in the world.
• This argument can be expressed as a philosophical dilemma: either God is not all-powerful or not good, which would make him either impotent or evil.
• A key assumption behind this argument is that if there's a good reason for God to allow evil, humans should be able to know it.
• The story of Job in the Bible is an ancient attempt to answer this question and provide a theodicy.
