[285.98 → 287.18] That starts next weekend.
[287.64 → 289.60] Now, if you want to do profession of faith,
[290.02 → 292.32] you have to take pastor's class ahead of that.
[292.66 → 295.36] But you don't have to do profession of faith
[295.36 → 296.88] if you take pastor's class.
[296.98 → 297.70] Does that make sense?
[298.12 → 299.86] So if you're planning on doing profession of faith,
[300.38 → 302.00] please come take pastor's class.
[302.16 → 304.16] But if you just want to take pastor's class,
[304.28 → 305.16] that's more than allowed.
[305.24 → 307.54] You don't have to do profession of faith afterwards.
[308.20 → 309.54] Young adults out there,
[309.54 → 312.50] this coming Friday, there is a young adults' event.
[312.72 → 313.98] They are at Willoughby.
[314.32 → 315.76] A number of churches are getting together,
[315.76 → 317.06] and they're going to do a trivia night,
[317.52 → 319.56] a little bit of a pub-style trivia night.
[319.60 → 320.50] It should be pretty fun.
[321.10 → 323.26] I encourage you to come out because you get to see me.
[323.48 → 324.28] I get to host.
[324.54 → 325.48] It's going to be very fun.
[326.14 → 328.52] So especially if you're in university and home for the summer,
[328.64 → 329.76] come on out, show off your knowledge,
[330.06 → 330.94] put a team together,
[331.26 → 332.88] and come on out to Willoughby Friday night.
[333.16 → 334.44] More details from Josh.
[334.70 → 336.96] You can chat with him when he gets back from California.
[338.08 → 340.90] Also, there are some sign-ups coming out
[340.90 → 341.96] that you need to know about.
[341.96 → 347.18] But first, taped to the children's sign-up booth in the back there,
[347.24 → 352.70] there is a sign-up sheet for those who are able to teach children's worship time in the summer.
[352.82 → 356.78] So we're looking for teachers and helpers to sign up to teach every week,
[357.22 → 360.20] to teach the preschool-aged kids throughout the summer.
[360.26 → 361.32] If that's something you're able to do,
[361.38 → 363.14] please talk to Amy or sign up in the back.
[363.22 → 367.08] There's also going to be a link in the bulletin coming out this week as well,
[367.08 → 367.88] so you can sign up there.
[368.32 → 370.36] Also, kids' camp is happening once again.
[370.64 → 373.22] There's some information about the bulletin about that.
[373.30 → 376.12] And sign-up is coming out later this week about kids' camp.
[376.22 → 378.32] That will be happening July 10 to 14.
[378.74 → 381.74] And finally, youth camp, we are doing that again at the end of July,
[381.86 → 384.74] or end of June, beginning of July, June 30 to July 2.
[385.06 → 385.78] Sign up for that.
[385.84 → 387.12] Youth is coming out this week as well.
[387.22 → 388.54] So be ready for that.
[389.02 → 390.08] For those of you who don't know me,
[390.18 → 391.26] I'm Kevin Robert.
[391.30 → 392.80] I'm the youth pastor here at this church.
[393.00 → 394.26] Our lead pastor, Chris,
[394.26 → 395.82] and our young adult guy, Josh,
[395.90 → 397.98] they're actually gallivanting in L.A. right now.
[398.38 → 400.90] They have a conference that they've been attending all weekend.
[401.10 → 402.52] So they're enjoying the sun,
[402.60 → 404.80] but joke's on them, we're enjoying the sun as well.
[404.92 → 406.80] So it is good to be with you this morning.
[407.24 → 408.72] I'm going to invite you all to stand
[408.72 → 412.02] and hear God's blessing this morning.
[414.28 → 417.60] God's greeting comes to us from Revelation 1,
[417.60 → 418.60] where he says,
[419.16 → 420.56] Grace and peace to you,
[420.84 → 423.98] from him who is and who was and who is to come,
[424.26 → 427.04] and from the seven spirits that are before his throne,
[427.34 → 428.62] and from Jesus Christ,
[428.96 → 430.40] who is the faithful witness,
[430.82 → 432.20] the firstborn of the dead,
[432.50 → 435.28] and the ruler of the kings of the earth.
[436.08 → 436.40] Amen.
[436.58 → 437.64] As God has greeted us this morning,
[437.74 → 439.60] please take a moment to greet those around you.
[439.60 → 444.90] Good morning.
[444.90 → 446.86] Good morning.

[464.40 → 476.26] Our call to worship this morning comes from 1 Chronicles 29, verses 10 through 13.
[477.00 → 483.36] Praise be to you, Lord, the God of our Father Israel, from everlasting to everlasting.

[999.74 → 1001.74] Lord Jesus, you chose us
[1001.74 → 1002.74] And appointed us to go
[1002.74 → 1003.74] And bear fruit
[1003.74 → 1005.74] Fruit that will last
[1005.74 → 1007.74] You are the gardener
[1007.74 → 1009.74] You prune every branch
[1009.74 → 1010.74] That bears fruit
[1010.74 → 1012.74] So it will be even more fruitful
[1012.74 → 1015.74] We desire to be filled
[1015.74 → 1016.74] To all your fullness
[1016.74 → 1018.74] So that we can bear fruit
[1018.74 → 1019.74] In your name
[1019.74 → 1021.74] Help us, Lord
[1021.74 → 1023.74] When we focus on the world
[1023.74 → 1024.74] And ignore you
[1024.74 → 1026.74] We confess that
[1026.74 → 1027.74] We do not always want
[1027.74 → 1028.74] To be your witnesses
[1028.74 → 1031.74] It's much easier to blend in
[1031.74 → 1034.74] But you call us to more
[1034.74 → 1036.74] Father, we thank you
[1036.74 → 1038.74] That we are good ground
[1038.74 → 1040.74] That we hear your word
[1040.74 → 1041.74] And understand it
[1041.74 → 1042.74] And that the word
[1042.74 → 1044.74] Bears fruit in our lives
[1044.74 → 1046.74] Sometimes a hundredfold
[1046.74 → 1047.74] Sometimes sixty
[1047.74 → 1049.74] Sometimes thirty
[1049.74 → 1051.74] We are like a tree
[1051.74 → 1052.74] We are like a tree
[1052.74 → 1054.74] Planted by the rivers of water
[1054.74 → 1055.74] That bring forth fruit
[1055.74 → 1056.74] In its season
[1056.74 → 1058.74] Thank you for filling us
[1058.74 → 1060.74] With the knowledge of your will
[1060.74 → 1061.74] And all wisdom
[1061.74 → 1063.74] And spiritual understanding
[1063.74 → 1066.74] That we may walk worthy of you, Lord
[1066.74 → 1069.74] Being fruitful in every good work
[1069.74 → 1072.74] And increasing in the knowledge of you
[1072.74 → 1074.74] Amen
[1074.74 → 1078.74] But blessed is the one who trusts in the Lord
[1078.74 → 1082.74] Whose confidence is in him
[1082.74 → 1085.74] They will be like a tree planted by the water
[1085.74 → 1088.74] That sends out its root by the stream
[1088.74 → 1092.74] It does not fear when heat comes
[1092.74 → 1095.74] Its leaves are always green
[1095.74 → 1098.74] It has no worries in a year of drought
[1098.74 → 1101.74] And it never fails to bear fruit
[1101.74 → 1105.74] Please stand with us as we sing
[1105.74 → 1106.74] Speak, O Lord
[1106.74 → 1111.74] Speak, O Lord
[1111.74 → 1114.74] Speak, O Lord
[1114.74 → 1118.74] As we come to you
[1118.74 → 1122.74] To receive the food
[1122.74 → 1126.74] Of your holy word
[1126.74 → 1130.74] Take your truth
[1130.74 → 1134.74] Plant is deep in us
[1134.74 → 1138.74] Shape and fashion us
[1138.74 → 1142.74] In your likeness
[1142.74 → 1146.74] That the light of Christ
[1146.74 → 1150.74] Might be seen today
[1150.74 → 1154.74] In our acts of love
[1154.74 → 1158.74] And our deeds of faith
[1158.74 → 1161.74] Speak, O Lord
[1161.74 → 1164.74] And fulfill in us
[1164.74 → 1168.74] All your purposes
[1168.74 → 1172.74] For your glory
[1172.74 → 1184.74] Teach us, Lord
[1184.74 → 1188.74] Lord, full obedience

[2026.78 → 2033.06] Good morning, everyone.
[2034.10 → 2041.64] Last week we had the privilege of affirming the names of people for office bearers for church for this upcoming terms.
[2042.64 → 2053.66] And today we have a process here in this church where we draw lots and to see who is going to be serving the congregation for the upcoming three-year term.
[2053.66 → 2058.18] This morning we have the opportunity to draw lots for the office bearers in our church community.
[2058.52 → 2061.76] We are grateful for the gift of good leaders in our church family.
[2062.76 → 2069.78] These people have expressed that willingness to serve, and our church family has affirmed their gifting to serve.
[2070.42 → 2074.14] We will begin with the office of deacon and then the office of admin elder.
[2074.78 → 2076.86] Before we draw lots, shall we pray together?
[2078.14 → 2083.48] Holy God, you promised to provide leaders for your church to faithfully serve our church family.
[2084.32 → 2090.42] Work now in the process of drawing lots to raise up from among us the next group of leaders to love and serve your church.
[2091.04 → 2092.48] In Jesus' name, amen.
[2093.34 → 2097.72] I'd like to call Emo Smith and Glenn Not up, please.
[2097.72 → 2097.80] Thank you.
[2097.80 → 2118.70] Emo and Glenn Not are our retiring office bearers, so they got the privilege of pulling the names out of the bag this morning.
[2118.70 → 2119.62] For Deacon
[2119.62 → 2125.46] is Mike Prince.
[2125.46 → 2131.74] And for Elder, Glenn, you've got to pull two out.
[2137.54 → 2140.68] Paul Kohl and Stephen Service.
[2140.68 → 2149.18] I don't know if they're here this morning, but if they are, thank you for putting your names forward,

[2152.82 → 2153.20] See you guys.

[2169.42 → 2175.82] Paul, we look forward to discerning together God's will and leading for our church family.
[2176.38 → 2180.44] To the ones whose names were not selected, we are grateful for your willingness to serve,
[2180.52 → 2185.24] and we pray that the Lord will provide a different and meaningful opportunity for you to do so in our midst.
[2185.24 → 2188.78] Again, on behalf of council and the church family, we thank you.
[2189.52 → 2194.06] Lord willing, we will install these new office bearers next Sunday at church.
[2194.26 → 2194.72] Thank you.
[2194.72 → 2206.20] It's time for Kids' Corner, so I'd like to invite any kids that are here to come on up to the front.
[2207.00 → 2210.52] If your age three, all the way up to grade four.
[2210.52 → 2223.94] Welcome up here.
[2224.04 → 2228.52] I wasn't sure how many kids we'd have, but...
[2228.52 → 2230.34] All right.
[2230.52 → 2233.90] So I brought something in my bag here today,
[2234.14 → 2237.40] and I'm hoping that you guys are going to know what these things are.
[2238.04 → 2239.00] I'm pretty sure you will.
[2240.52 → 2241.86] There is a rip.
[2241.92 → 2242.70] My dog ate it.
[2245.88 → 2246.42] All right.
[2246.46 → 2247.44] Here's the first thing.
[2248.04 → 2248.54] Are you ready?
[2251.26 → 2251.96] An apple.
[2254.16 → 2255.46] Do you have apples at your house?
[2255.50 → 2255.92] That's great.
[2256.00 → 2256.94] They're a healthy thing to eat.
[2257.02 → 2257.18] Okay.
[2257.22 → 2258.04] I got another thing.
[2261.08 → 2261.74] An orange.
[2261.90 → 2263.18] You got some oranges at your house, too?
[2264.02 → 2264.42] Yeah.
[2265.28 → 2265.80] All right.
[2265.84 → 2267.06] So we got an apple and orange.
[2267.14 → 2268.68] What do you think might be next?
[2270.52 → 2271.48] A grape.
[2271.48 → 2271.52] A banana.
[2271.52 → 2272.08] A banana.
[2272.08 → 2273.52] A banana.
[2273.52 → 2274.04] A banana.
[2274.04 → 2274.14] A banana.
[2274.14 → 2276.14] A banana.
[2276.14 → 2277.04] A banana.
[2277.04 → 2278.20] A banana.
[2278.20 → 2281.26] Oh, that's so great.
[2282.26 → 2282.68] Okay.
[2282.96 → 2283.94] I got more.
[2284.78 → 2286.00] Are you going to guess the next one?
[2286.00 → 2286.26] A grape.
[2286.26 → 2288.26] A grape.
[2288.26 → 2288.88] A grape.
[2293.88 → 2295.02] It's a lime.
[2295.20 → 2296.54] It's a lime juice.
[2296.74 → 2298.34] But it's kind of like a lime, right?
[2299.34 → 2300.76] Do you have a lime at your house?
[2301.20 → 2301.72] You do?
[2301.80 → 2303.08] Oh, I should have asked you to bring one.
[2303.66 → 2303.96] Okay.
[2304.02 → 2304.70] We got a lime.
[2304.78 → 2306.20] Just use a little bit of your imagination.
[2306.44 → 2307.08] I got one more.
[2307.26 → 2308.06] It's in a container.
[2310.06 → 2310.42] Cookies.
[2311.42 → 2311.90] Cookies?
[2311.90 → 2311.98] Cookies?
[2311.98 → 2312.02] Cookies?
[2315.22 → 2315.66] No.
[2315.82 → 2316.06] No.
[2316.22 → 2316.44] No.
[2316.44 → 2316.50] No.
[2317.28 → 2318.22] Do you know it?
[2318.22 → 2318.36] Do you know it?
[2318.36 → 2318.66] Do you know it?
[2318.66 → 2318.84] Do you know it?
[2319.92 → 2320.28] Strawberry.
[2321.04 → 2321.28] Strawberry.
[2322.22 → 2323.02] I better put that one.
[2323.06 → 2324.50] I didn't want that one to get too squished.
[2324.66 → 2326.46] So can you guys tell me?
[2326.80 → 2327.88] I'll put that one like that.
[2328.82 → 2332.58] Can you tell me something that is different about all these fruits?
[2333.22 → 2333.48] Zoe?
[2333.74 → 2334.86] They're healthy for you.
[2335.12 → 2336.32] Well, they're all healthy for you.
[2336.64 → 2336.88] Yeah.
[2336.98 → 2337.48] That's true.
[2337.92 → 2338.88] They're different colours.
[2339.46 → 2339.70] Ruby?
[2340.56 → 2341.94] They're different shapes.
[2342.36 → 2342.64] Julia?
[2342.64 → 2342.76] Yeah.
[2343.56 → 2345.70] They taste a little bit different from each other.
[2345.78 → 2347.98] And what would be the same about all of them?
[2348.06 → 2349.46] Besides, so Zoe had one idea.
[2349.52 → 2350.30] They're all healthy.
[2350.82 → 2350.98] Yeah.
[2351.08 → 2351.28] Bean.
[2353.36 → 2354.46] They're all fruits.
[2354.70 → 2355.06] Exactly.
[2355.36 → 2356.08] They're all fruits.
[2356.08 → 2360.82] So today in Children's Worship Time, we are going to talk about fruit that's mentioned
[2360.82 → 2361.44] in the Bible.
[2361.68 → 2363.90] And they're called the fruit of the Spirit.
[2365.08 → 2366.96] And there are different fruits of the Spirit.
[2366.96 → 2370.92] And they're all a little bit different, but they are all part of showing God's love to
[2370.92 → 2371.38] the world.
[2371.54 → 2376.38] So we're going to learn about how love is something in common for all the fruits of the Spirit,
[2377.12 → 2378.54] but how they're all a little different.
[2378.76 → 2381.88] And we're going to learn about those for the next few weeks, the different fruits of the
[2381.88 → 2382.06] Spirit.
[2382.60 → 2384.72] So could you please stand up with me?
[2385.12 → 2385.96] And we'll do the blessing.
[2389.96 → 2390.24] All right.
[2390.24 → 2392.66] the Lord.
[2392.66 → 2421.20] Good morning.
[2421.20 → 2451.18] Good morning.
[2451.32 → 2459.02] Lord, this Sunday morning, as a body of believers at Emanuel Church, we remember that you are the vine and we are the branches.
[2459.82 → 2463.14] We long to bear much fruit by remaining in you.
[2463.62 → 2466.88] And we know that we are dead and withering apart from you.
[2467.32 → 2469.64] We pray, God, that you draw us near to you.
[2469.64 → 2477.12] We praise you, Lord, for the new council members who are just drawn by you to serve in your church.
[2477.64 → 2480.12] We pray that you bless their work and their leadership, Lord.
[2480.12 → 2489.14] Lord, provide all of our leaders, as well as those of us who lead outside the church, with wisdom and strength to do their work to further your kingdom.
[2489.14 → 2494.12] We pray, Lord, for those who are preparing for public profession of faith.
[2494.86 → 2497.54] Bless them with growth in their relationship with you.
[2497.54 → 2503.30] We also lift those who are struggling at this time to walk by faith and not by sight.
[2503.94 → 2507.72] Draw us to you, helping us to seek your word for our lives.
[2507.72 → 2514.74] Lord, we have limitless freedom and access to your word, yet we often neglect to spend time in it.
[2515.46 → 2516.66] Change our hearts, O God.
[2517.20 → 2525.30] If we remain in you and your word remains in us, we are assured that we can ask whatever we wish, and it will be done to your glory, Father.
[2525.96 → 2528.20] And we will bear much fruit as your disciples.
[2528.20 → 2535.94] Lord, we ask for your healing hand on all the health concerns and struggles we have in our congregation at this time.
[2536.44 → 2539.86] And we praise your name for all the blessings you have poured out on us.
[2540.48 → 2543.16] We pray for Rose Vita as she is ill at home.
[2543.62 → 2546.38] We ask, Lord, that you bring her back to full health.
[2547.24 → 2551.52] We praise you that Doreen's pacemaker surgery and recovery has been going well.
[2552.48 → 2556.78] And, Lord, we lift Rich as she has her hip replacement scheduled for this Wednesday.
[2556.78 → 2559.26] Bless the surgery that it may go well.
[2559.88 → 2566.62] And we ask, Lord, that Rich can recover to the mobility without pain and discomfort that she has been dealing with for so long.
[2567.76 → 2571.04] We pray, Lord, for SAI as his cancer treatments are nearly done.
[2571.26 → 2573.44] And we praise you that it is going well.
[2574.84 → 2580.14] Lord, we lift several people that we know of with injuries and broken bones.
[2580.90 → 2585.02] Lord, bring healing to their bodies and provide patience and trust in you
[2585.02 → 2587.58] during the sometimes long roads to recovery.
[2588.94 → 2591.74] Lord, we lift those among us with aging parents.
[2592.16 → 2596.68] And we pray that as our bodies weaken, our faith and trust in you will be strengthened.
[2597.24 → 2603.14] We ask that you provide caregivers and families with wisdom in discerning best ways to provide care.
[2604.34 → 2608.54] Lord, we pray for those of us who are mourning the loss of people we have loved dearly.
[2609.60 → 2612.38] Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
[2612.38 → 2619.64] Lord, we pray for those who are struggling with mental health issues and with those who are supporting and caring for them.
[2620.22 → 2625.32] Give us your grace to love and care for each other in all circumstances.
[2627.08 → 2630.44] Lord, we pray for individuals and families who are broken and hurting.
[2630.98 → 2635.86] Some of us are burdened by the impacts of addictions in our lives or in the lives of those we care about.
[2636.40 → 2638.28] Lord, break the chains that bind us.
[2638.28 → 2643.68] We pray for the world we live in, as so much of the world has not remained in you.
[2644.28 → 2650.62] There are wars, hunger, corruption, distortion of truth, and even denial that truth exists.
[2651.58 → 2656.78] Lord, please have mercy on us and use us as your people to call your world back to you.
[2657.92 → 2661.56] Lord, we pray for Pastor Kevin as he shares your words for us this morning.
[2661.56 → 2667.52] Let the words you speak to us today remain in us and flow from us beyond this place.
[2668.00 → 2671.22] We ask all these things in the blessed name of our Saviour Jesus.
[2671.70 → 2671.96] Amen.
[2671.96 → 2672.06] Amen.
[2691.56 → 2702.48] As I mentioned, Pastor Chris and Josh Chamberlain are off gallivanting in sunny California,
[2702.80 → 2705.50] attending this Leadership in Theology conference right now.
[2705.54 → 2706.06] But you know what?
[2706.38 → 2710.96] We are going to have just as much fun as them today, because we are opening up the Book of Romans,
[2711.18 → 2713.62] and we have all been very excited about that sermon series.
[2713.62 → 2715.58] So I'm looking forward to opening again.
[2715.58 → 2719.68] But it has been a while since we've opened this book.
[2720.00 → 2721.04] March 26.
[2721.76 → 2725.76] That was the last time we opened Romans and looked at it in this church.
[2726.14 → 2729.96] Now, since then, we've journeyed through Lent and prepared for Good Friday and Easter Sunday.
[2730.40 → 2735.02] We've enjoyed Gems Sunday and looked at their theme verse, Micah 6, verse 8.
[2735.26 → 2740.60] And then we spent the last four weeks looking at the Book of Jonah, a little man and a big fish.
[2740.74 → 2741.88] That's what I would have called the series.
[2742.34 → 2745.44] But today, we're going to jump back into Romans.
[2745.58 → 2750.74] And continue sort of our year-long look at this letter from Paul.
[2752.72 → 2757.32] Now, it's worth mentioning that this pattern is actually going to continue sort of going forward.
[2757.42 → 2761.76] For the next six Sundays or so, we're going to go back into Romans and keep moving along in our series.
[2762.28 → 2765.66] But then when summer hits, we're going to take a bit of a break again and look at something different.
[2766.12 → 2771.80] When September and October rolls around, we'll get back into Romans and look at it for an extended chunk of time.
[2771.80 → 2774.14] Then we'll stop over the Christmas season, of course.
[2774.46 → 2778.00] And then we'll likely finish off Romans in the new year.
[2778.74 → 2781.42] All of that said, today we get back at it.
[2782.16 → 2785.66] And today we're going to look at the next chunk of this letter.
[2786.42 → 2790.22] This is the perfect passage, actually, to springboard back into this series.
[2790.22 → 2796.14] Because it revisits the themes that we looked at last time in Romans chapter 6.
[2796.48 → 2804.06] Now, for those of you who have better memories than I do, you'll remember that eight weeks ago, Paul asked,
[2804.60 → 2808.18] Shall we go on sinning so that grace can increase?
[2808.18 → 2814.46] And so Paul wrote in Romans 6, and then Pastor Chris highlighted in his message that, of course, we cannot do that.
[2814.82 → 2821.18] We cannot keep on sinning because through Jesus' death, we died to sin as well.
[2821.40 → 2823.22] And therefore, we cannot go on sinning.
[2823.98 → 2826.96] Then in Romans 6.15, Paul asks another question.
[2827.08 → 2832.32] He says, Shall we sin because we are no longer under the law but under grace?
[2832.32 → 2838.54] Basically, the question is, Jesus saves us all anyway, so why don't we just go and do whatever we want?
[2839.62 → 2843.60] And again, the answer is no, of course we cannot do that, for the wages of sin is death.
[2844.60 → 2848.08] But the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[2848.14 → 2851.46] That's Romans 6.23, which brings us to today's text.
[2852.02 → 2855.62] Romans 7, verses 1 to 6, the chunk that we're going to look at today.
[2855.88 → 2859.54] In this text, Paul brings up these themes that we looked at last time.
[2859.54 → 2865.48] And he answers the question, Can't we just do whatever we want if Jesus saves us anyway, if grace is so big?
[2866.00 → 2869.06] But he answers this question with a different example.
[2869.78 → 2871.18] And so we'll look at that today. Let's read it now.
[2871.24 → 2873.50] We're going to go and look at Romans 7, 1 to 6.
[2873.58 → 2878.18] It'll be on the screen behind me, but please, as always, I encourage you, have your Bibles open in front of you.
[2878.44 → 2884.90] Have your Bible apps open on your phone so you can revisit this text as we make our way through it today.
[2886.14 → 2888.54] Romans 7, 1 to 6, says this.
[2889.54 → 2894.72] Do you not know, brothers and sisters, for I am speaking to those who know the law,
[2895.28 → 2899.30] that the law has authority over someone only as long as that person lives?
[2900.16 → 2905.48] For example, by law, a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive.
[2905.54 → 2910.18] But if her husband dies, she is released from the law that binds her to him.
[2910.18 → 2915.40] So then, if she has sexual relations with another man while her husband is still alive,
[2915.74 → 2917.98] she is called an adulteress.
[2918.64 → 2922.04] But if her husband dies, she is released from that law
[2922.04 → 2925.34] and is not an adulteress if she marries another man.
[2925.34 → 2933.12] So, my brothers and sisters, you also died to the law through the body of Christ,
[2933.26 → 2937.90] that you might belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead,
[2938.16 → 2941.48] in order that we might bear fruit for God.
[2942.30 → 2944.52] For when we were in the realm of the flesh,
[2944.86 → 2948.30] the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in us,
[2948.40 → 2950.26] so that we bore fruit for death.
[2950.26 → 2954.98] But now, by dying to what once bound us,
[2955.48 → 2957.28] we have been released from the law,
[2957.60 → 2960.06] so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit
[2960.06 → 2963.96] and not in the old way of the written code,
[2964.54 → 2965.92] the word of the Lord.
[2968.48 → 2971.24] Now, like I mentioned, this passage today,
[2971.52 → 2974.58] as well as the passage from Romans 6, 1 to 11,
[2974.68 → 2976.32] they follow a similar pattern.
[2976.86 → 2977.98] And this pattern looks like this.
[2978.00 → 2978.84] It's a four-parter.
[2978.90 → 2979.54] It looks like this.
[2980.92 → 2983.28] One, we once belonged to sin,
[2983.40 → 2986.42] and we were bound to the law and failed to live by it.
[2987.26 → 2989.80] Two, then Jesus came, and in his death,
[2990.12 → 2992.60] we died as well in order to overcome the law.
[2993.66 → 2995.44] Three, we now have a new birth,
[2995.48 → 2996.74] or as this passage says,
[2996.82 → 2999.84] a new marriage or union with Christ.
[3000.12 → 3001.22] And then finally, four,
[3001.40 → 3005.18] we are called to bear out fruit for Jesus.
[3006.10 → 3008.60] Now, that's the simple summary of not just this passage,
[3008.60 → 3011.30] but the passage Pastor Chris looked at eight weeks ago.
[3011.52 → 3013.10] But before we really get moving here,
[3013.12 → 3014.38] I do have to mention one thing.
[3015.18 → 3016.44] My parents are in town.
[3017.04 → 3018.06] That's very exciting.
[3018.76 → 3019.28] They're in town.
[3019.36 → 3020.34] They've come for the long weekend,
[3020.34 → 3021.72] and my mom is sitting right there,
[3021.82 → 3023.34] like 14 feet away.
[3023.60 → 3025.54] And it's classic, because of course,
[3025.76 → 3027.92] the passage that she gets to sit here,
[3028.04 → 3029.20] that I get to speak about,
[3029.20 → 3033.38] is just full of intimate sexual words.
[3033.88 → 3034.12] Right?
[3034.18 → 3036.14] Like, that is Murphy's Law.
[3037.68 → 3039.20] And now, you might be asking,
[3039.30 → 3040.62] but look at this text today.
[3040.72 → 3043.42] Look at the words that Paul uses to describe here.
[3044.40 → 3047.14] He uses sexual relations in verse 3.
[3047.36 → 3050.12] He calls out adultery and adulterous behaviour
[3050.12 → 3051.16] also in verse 3.
[3051.38 → 3053.08] He talks about belonging to God,
[3053.12 → 3054.36] or belonging to one another.
[3054.36 → 3055.92] And that doesn't sound so racy,
[3056.04 → 3056.92] but like in the Greek,
[3057.04 → 3060.12] it means like belonging to each other.
[3060.28 → 3061.40] That's what Paul's getting at.
[3061.74 → 3064.94] Bear fruit is language that he uses on purpose in verse 4.
[3065.00 → 3069.32] And finally, Paul speaks of aroused passions in verse 5.
[3069.62 → 3074.72] This is sexualized language done on purpose by Paul.
[3074.72 → 3079.98] Because Paul is using marital intimacy
[3079.98 → 3082.26] as his example here
[3082.26 → 3085.92] on how Christ and our relationship should work.
[3087.44 → 3090.00] Marital intimacy is the foundational point
[3090.00 → 3090.98] of this chunk of text.
[3091.28 → 3092.70] He is unabashedly saying
[3092.70 → 3095.26] that when we die with Christ to sin,
[3095.64 → 3097.54] we are not simply just born again,
[3097.98 → 3100.90] but we are newly married to Him.
[3101.54 → 3103.20] Newly married to Christ.
[3103.20 → 3104.96] We are intimate with Him.
[3105.10 → 3106.44] We are united with Him.
[3106.52 → 3108.36] We belong to Him.
[3110.50 → 3112.96] Because that's the closest example
[3112.96 → 3114.18] that Paul can think of
[3114.18 → 3117.16] to show how intimate our relationship
[3117.16 → 3118.54] between Christ needs to be.
[3118.86 → 3120.68] How intimate the relationship
[3120.68 → 3123.50] between Christ and I need to be.
[3123.60 → 3124.84] How intimate the relationship
[3124.84 → 3127.42] between Christ and you need to be.
[3128.94 → 3132.30] Paul's not over-sexualizing this text here as a joke.
[3132.30 → 3134.72] He's not writing this in a risqué way,
[3134.72 → 3136.66] but in a very purposefully,
[3137.04 → 3139.74] very intimately loving kind of way.
[3140.86 → 3142.16] Paul's highlighting here
[3142.16 → 3144.74] that our natural inclinations change
[3144.74 → 3147.08] when we die with Christ to sin
[3147.08 → 3149.48] and are remarried to Him.
[3150.26 → 3152.14] Our tendencies go from death
[3152.14 → 3154.32] and sin and destruction,
[3154.32 → 3159.16] and they change to life and obedience
[3159.16 → 3160.20] and regeneration.
[3162.14 → 3164.48] When we die with Christ to our sin,
[3164.66 → 3167.32] we are united intimately with Jesus,
[3167.64 → 3168.22] our Saviour.
[3168.22 → 3170.68] When we promise our life to Him
[3170.68 → 3171.72] above all things,
[3172.22 → 3173.96] our natural tendencies shift
[3173.96 → 3175.30] from death, sin, and destruction
[3175.30 → 3178.02] to life, obedience, and regeneration.
[3178.26 → 3179.80] That's our big idea for today.
[3179.80 → 3182.72] When we become intimately united with Christ,
[3183.62 → 3185.64] our lives must bear His fruit.
[3186.88 → 3188.88] So let's pick this passage apart a little bit
[3188.88 → 3190.56] and see how this is true.
[3190.64 → 3192.18] We're going to look at this passage
[3192.18 → 3193.60] in sort of three different chunks.
[3194.08 → 3195.52] So the first chunk is verse 1,
[3196.24 → 3197.60] and that's about sort of
[3197.60 → 3199.30] the legal principle of the law.
[3200.20 → 3201.98] The second chunk is verses 2 and 3,
[3202.06 → 3203.82] the example of marriage that Paul uses.
[3203.96 → 3205.98] And then the third chunk is verses 4 through 6,
[3205.98 → 3208.14] the implication and then application
[3208.14 → 3210.04] for us here today.
[3210.14 → 3211.54] First off, Romans 7 verse 1.
[3211.70 → 3212.88] Now this is very important.
[3213.00 → 3213.88] It sets the table.
[3214.20 → 3215.80] It's also going to be a very short point.
[3216.02 → 3217.36] So, I don't know.
[3217.40 → 3218.32] You're welcome, I guess.
[3219.78 → 3221.30] The first verse of our text,
[3221.80 → 3223.62] Paul points out that the law
[3223.62 → 3226.30] only holds power over you
[3226.30 → 3229.50] if you are, in fact, alive.
[3230.74 → 3231.90] Paul says in verse 1
[3231.90 → 3233.64] that the law has authority over someone
[3233.64 → 3235.60] only as long as that person lives.
[3235.60 → 3236.70] And I know what you're thinking.
[3237.18 → 3238.98] You have never thought of that before.
[3239.76 → 3242.54] This is new, groundbreaking information to you.
[3242.88 → 3243.96] But the truth is,
[3244.14 → 3245.38] speeding on your way to work
[3245.38 → 3247.72] is only a law for people who are living.
[3249.00 → 3249.26] Right?
[3249.66 → 3251.62] Same with owning a pet rat in Alberta
[3251.62 → 3253.94] or whistling in Petrolic, Ontario
[3253.94 → 3257.52] or building a snowman over 30 inches tall in PEI
[3257.52 → 3259.46] or claiming that something is maple syrup
[3259.46 → 3260.10] here in Canada
[3260.10 → 3261.86] when in fact it is not maple syrup.
[3262.46 → 3263.94] Yes, those are all true laws.
[3263.94 → 3265.62] Yes, I look them all up.
[3265.76 → 3268.52] And yes, they all only apply to you
[3268.52 → 3270.00] if you are alive.
[3271.46 → 3273.24] So, maybe those aren't the best examples
[3273.24 → 3275.24] because, honestly, police in Prince Edward Island
[3275.24 → 3276.82] would only be arresting, like, eight-year-olds
[3276.82 → 3278.50] if they actually enforce the snowman one.
[3278.76 → 3280.02] But to Paul's point,
[3280.72 → 3283.20] no matter how logical
[3283.20 → 3285.80] or how ridiculous a law is,
[3286.52 → 3288.64] they only affect us when we are alive.
[3289.08 → 3290.74] Dead people don't worry about laws.
[3290.74 → 3292.22] Makes sense, right?
[3292.28 → 3293.14] This is true now.
[3293.38 → 3294.90] It is true with the Mosaic Law
[3294.90 → 3295.98] that Paul is talking about.
[3296.16 → 3296.96] It's been true forever.
[3297.48 → 3299.86] The law holds no power over you
[3299.86 → 3300.60] if you are dead.
[3302.14 → 3303.40] And while that may be obvious
[3303.40 → 3304.70] and maybe seems kind of silly
[3304.70 → 3305.62] to even bring it up,
[3305.84 → 3308.42] it's theologically so very important
[3308.42 → 3309.30] to Paul's point.
[3310.56 → 3312.64] Because in the section of this text,
[3312.76 → 3313.94] I told you that first one was fast,
[3314.26 → 3315.60] he gives an example
[3315.60 → 3317.14] that highlights this truth.
[3317.14 → 3319.72] In verses 2 to 3,
[3319.84 → 3321.30] he uses the example of marriage
[3321.30 → 3322.58] to drive this point home.
[3323.48 → 3324.76] Paul says that when you're married,
[3325.20 → 3327.58] as long as your spouse is alive,
[3327.74 → 3329.72] you are bound to them in marriage.
[3329.80 → 3330.94] By the law of marriage,
[3331.40 → 3332.30] you are together.
[3332.42 → 3334.10] If you were to be sexually intimate
[3334.10 → 3335.26] with someone else
[3335.26 → 3337.08] while your spouse is still living,
[3338.00 → 3339.02] you would be an adulterer.
[3339.20 → 3340.86] You would be committing adultery.
[3340.96 → 3342.58] Again, this is not necessarily groundbreaking.
[3342.78 → 3344.14] Christians and non-Christians alike
[3344.14 → 3345.16] believe this to be true.
[3345.16 → 3348.72] However, if sadly your spouse
[3348.72 → 3349.70] were to pass away,
[3350.86 → 3351.76] you would be free
[3351.76 → 3353.46] from sort of the law of marriage
[3353.46 → 3354.78] and then you would be allowed
[3354.78 → 3356.56] and able to go and marry someone else.
[3357.30 → 3358.58] The death of your spouse
[3358.58 → 3359.84] breaks the bonds
[3359.84 → 3361.28] of the law of marriage
[3361.28 → 3363.18] and you're free to marry somebody else.
[3365.00 → 3366.86] Now, youth pastor side point here,
[3366.98 → 3367.88] youth, young people,
[3368.02 → 3368.98] even some of you old people,
[3369.06 → 3370.46] notice what Paul says here in verse 3.
[3370.92 → 3372.20] It says, Paul writes,
[3372.20 → 3374.14] she, so the spouse of the husband
[3374.14 → 3374.92] who's passed away,
[3375.22 → 3376.76] she's released from the law,
[3376.88 → 3377.60] the law of marriage,
[3377.74 → 3379.36] and is not an adulteress
[3379.36 → 3380.34] if she, what?
[3380.78 → 3383.10] If she marries another man.
[3383.26 → 3384.58] Notice Paul doesn't say here
[3384.58 → 3385.84] if she sleeps with.
[3386.08 → 3386.92] She says marries.
[3387.06 → 3388.50] Sex is for marriage.
[3388.98 → 3389.50] Paul doesn't say
[3389.50 → 3390.40] when you're not married
[3390.40 → 3391.60] or you become unmarried,
[3391.68 → 3392.58] you're free to sleep around
[3392.58 → 3393.74] until you find your next spouse.
[3394.16 → 3395.58] No, Paul says
[3395.58 → 3396.68] if your spouse passes,
[3397.04 → 3398.04] you don't have permission
[3398.04 → 3399.66] to sleep with whoever you want.
[3399.66 → 3401.24] You have permission at that point
[3401.24 → 3402.10] to get remarried.
[3402.42 → 3404.40] The bonds of the law of marriage
[3404.40 → 3404.84] are broken
[3404.84 → 3406.04] and you can get remarried.
[3407.42 → 3409.00] Marital intimacy is just that.
[3409.08 → 3409.64] It's marital.
[3411.02 → 3411.94] And only death,
[3412.20 → 3413.26] according to Paul here,
[3413.36 → 3416.00] can break the bonds of marriage.
[3417.30 → 3419.22] There, the youth pastor side tangent over,
[3419.34 → 3420.48] but that is important
[3420.48 → 3421.82] because Paul's point
[3421.82 → 3424.20] is that marital intimacy is forever.
[3425.30 → 3427.38] It can only be broken by death
[3427.38 → 3429.34] till death do us part.
[3429.34 → 3430.74] That's why we say that at weddings.
[3432.58 → 3433.64] And this matters
[3433.64 → 3436.42] because only death
[3436.42 → 3438.36] breaks the bonds of law
[3438.36 → 3440.80] because the law doesn't apply to you
[3440.80 → 3441.50] if you are dead.
[3443.46 → 3446.10] Now, remember way back in Genesis
[3446.10 → 3447.94] when Adam and Eve kind of messed up
[3447.94 → 3448.68] and they ate the fruit
[3448.68 → 3450.42] and then humanity fell into sin forever?
[3450.64 → 3452.16] Well, now all of humanity
[3452.16 → 3454.18] is bound to sin
[3454.18 → 3455.56] and death in this world.
[3456.16 → 3457.46] The law was made to show
[3457.46 → 3459.30] what righteous living for God
[3459.30 → 3460.00] would look like,
[3460.00 → 3462.18] but it also revealed
[3462.18 → 3464.02] how broken and depraved
[3464.02 → 3465.86] and sinful we all actually are,
[3465.98 → 3467.42] how bound to sin
[3467.42 → 3469.00] we all actually are.
[3469.66 → 3470.56] So when Paul says
[3470.56 → 3471.94] we're bound to the law,
[3472.14 → 3472.80] or more accurately,
[3472.94 → 3473.98] we're bound to the sin
[3473.98 → 3475.20] which the law reveals,
[3475.70 → 3478.22] the only way to break the bonds
[3478.22 → 3480.30] of the law of sin and death
[3480.30 → 3483.08] is with death.
[3484.98 → 3486.52] That's why even if it seems obvious
[3486.52 → 3487.02] or silly,
[3487.12 → 3487.80] it's important to hear
[3487.80 → 3488.82] that death absolves you
[3488.82 → 3490.04] from being bound to the law.
[3490.36 → 3490.82] In marriage,
[3490.94 → 3491.84] that means through death
[3491.84 → 3493.46] you are able to marry again.
[3493.92 → 3494.44] This here,
[3494.54 → 3495.36] this text says
[3495.36 → 3496.52] because of the law
[3496.52 → 3498.78] which cannot deliver you
[3498.78 → 3500.22] from sin in the flesh,
[3500.30 → 3502.56] it cannot produce obedience
[3502.56 → 3504.16] with you or to God.
[3504.38 → 3505.62] The law cannot save you.
[3505.68 → 3507.04] The law cannot justify you.
[3507.12 → 3509.00] The law cannot sanctify you.
[3509.46 → 3509.74] Actually,
[3509.82 → 3510.66] because of our nature,
[3511.14 → 3512.24] our bonds to the law
[3512.24 → 3513.44] only lead to death.
[3513.76 → 3514.90] And in order for that bond
[3514.90 → 3515.62] to be broken,
[3516.34 → 3517.74] death needs to happen.
[3520.84 → 3521.62] Now again,
[3522.10 → 3523.66] the law itself is not bad
[3523.66 → 3524.88] and Paul's going to get to that
[3524.88 → 3525.82] in our next passage.
[3525.98 → 3527.16] And Pastor Chris,
[3527.22 → 3527.40] sorry,
[3527.56 → 3528.14] called him piss.
[3528.22 → 3528.84] That's embarrassing.
[3529.30 → 3530.94] That's online for the world to see.
[3531.74 → 3532.40] Pastor Chris,
[3532.44 → 3533.98] he's going to go into this
[3533.98 → 3535.16] all next week.
[3535.46 → 3535.72] Actually,
[3535.78 → 3536.38] next week he gets
[3536.38 → 3537.16] a very fun text.
[3537.22 → 3538.04] If you know Romans at all
[3538.04 → 3538.50] a little bit,
[3538.86 → 3540.76] the second half of Romans 7
[3540.76 → 3541.68] is the whole passage
[3541.68 → 3542.38] where Paul says,
[3543.04 → 3543.96] for what I want to do,
[3544.00 → 3544.52] I do not do,
[3544.58 → 3545.62] but what I do not want to do,
[3545.66 → 3545.94] I do.
[3546.24 → 3547.30] And he goes on forever
[3547.30 → 3548.60] on that tangent.
[3548.70 → 3549.22] And it's awesome
[3549.22 → 3550.38] and very fun to see
[3550.38 → 3552.54] Pastor Chris talk about that.
[3553.24 → 3554.04] But the point is,
[3554.12 → 3555.10] the law is not bad.
[3555.20 → 3555.50] In fact,
[3555.54 → 3557.08] it reveals the holiness of God
[3557.08 → 3558.00] and yet we need more
[3558.00 → 3558.76] than the law.
[3559.46 → 3560.66] If we relied on the law
[3560.66 → 3561.40] to save us,
[3561.44 → 3562.22] all of us would be hooped.
[3562.22 → 3566.00] We all need the law-fulfilling,
[3566.28 → 3567.50] sin-bearing substitute
[3567.50 → 3568.48] of Jesus Christ.
[3570.14 → 3571.26] That's what Romans 6,
[3571.32 → 3572.28] 1 to 11 was saying
[3572.28 → 3572.92] when we looked at it
[3572.92 → 3573.44] eight weeks ago.
[3573.48 → 3574.72] That's what Paul is saying
[3574.72 → 3575.32] here today
[3575.32 → 3576.76] through our union with Christ,
[3577.22 → 3578.62] symbolized by being wed
[3578.62 → 3579.80] to him in his death
[3579.80 → 3580.54] and in his resurrection.
[3580.88 → 3581.94] We have the power
[3581.94 → 3582.54] of the Spirit
[3582.54 → 3584.22] to bear fruit for God.
[3584.84 → 3586.00] We were once united
[3586.00 → 3586.84] to the law,
[3587.00 → 3588.50] united to sin.
[3588.50 → 3590.60] And the only way
[3590.60 → 3591.92] for that union to break
[3591.92 → 3592.96] was with death.
[3595.58 → 3595.90] And so,
[3596.02 → 3597.96] to the point of this text
[3597.96 → 3598.58] and honestly,
[3598.68 → 3600.02] to the point of all Scripture,
[3601.02 → 3602.66] either we have to die
[3602.66 → 3604.32] to break that bond
[3604.32 → 3606.96] or someone dies for us.
[3608.20 → 3609.98] Someone dies in our place.
[3611.26 → 3612.74] And Jesus came
[3612.74 → 3613.92] and fulfilled that.
[3614.50 → 3616.30] Jesus came into this world
[3616.30 → 3618.46] and he lived a perfect life
[3618.46 → 3619.08] to the law
[3619.08 → 3620.22] that we should have lived,
[3620.48 → 3621.34] a life that you and I
[3621.34 → 3622.14] have not upheld.
[3622.42 → 3624.00] And then in his perfection,
[3624.68 → 3625.88] Jesus died the death
[3625.88 → 3627.26] that you and I deserved.
[3628.38 → 3629.42] And in that death,
[3629.60 → 3631.10] Jesus broke the bonds
[3631.10 → 3632.86] of the law of sin and death
[3632.86 → 3634.48] that were holding us captive.
[3634.74 → 3635.52] And then victoriously,
[3635.66 → 3636.40] three days later,
[3636.48 → 3637.60] Jesus rises again
[3637.60 → 3639.52] from the grave,
[3639.86 → 3641.32] victoriously defeating death
[3641.32 → 3642.08] once and for all.
[3642.30 → 3642.78] And then,
[3642.86 → 3644.06] what we celebrated on Thursday,
[3644.26 → 3645.40] Jesus ascends to heaven
[3645.40 → 3646.92] and now he is in heaven,
[3647.30 → 3648.22] seated at the right hand
[3648.22 → 3648.68] of God,
[3649.30 → 3650.80] interceding on your behalf,
[3650.84 → 3652.04] on my behalf.
[3652.98 → 3654.70] Because in Christ's death,
[3654.78 → 3656.38] we also died to sin
[3656.38 → 3658.36] and we were remarried
[3658.36 → 3658.90] to Christ.
[3660.10 → 3661.76] This language of being
[3661.76 → 3662.86] the bride of Christ
[3662.86 → 3664.08] that we hear so often,
[3664.14 → 3664.96] that we use so often,
[3665.10 → 3666.24] we use this all the time,
[3666.28 → 3666.64] but have you ever
[3666.64 → 3667.74] actually thought about it?
[3668.56 → 3669.16] Have you ever actually
[3669.16 → 3670.48] thought about what that means?
[3671.16 → 3672.88] We are married to Jesus,
[3673.68 → 3674.74] the Saviour who died
[3674.74 → 3675.24] to free you
[3675.24 → 3676.72] from the bonds of sin.
[3677.12 → 3677.96] And that becomes
[3677.96 → 3678.62] the implication.
[3678.80 → 3679.70] That is the third part
[3679.70 → 3680.32] of this text.
[3680.42 → 3681.32] Verses four to six
[3681.32 → 3681.86] get to this.
[3682.54 → 3683.78] We died to the law
[3683.78 → 3684.82] in Jesus' death.
[3685.92 → 3686.96] Jesus died to defeat
[3686.96 → 3687.58] sin and death
[3687.58 → 3688.48] and destruction
[3688.48 → 3689.82] so that when we believe,
[3690.32 → 3691.88] we die to the law too.
[3692.92 → 3694.36] And now we're full of life,
[3695.36 → 3695.84] obedience,
[3696.86 → 3697.30] regeneration.
[3697.30 → 3699.82] Not only that,
[3699.88 → 3700.66] but when these bonds
[3700.66 → 3701.22] were broken,
[3701.34 → 3702.22] we were remarried.
[3703.08 → 3704.90] We became the bride of Christ,
[3705.02 → 3706.36] living in an intimate,
[3706.82 → 3707.94] loving relationship
[3707.94 → 3709.36] with our Saviour and King.
[3709.78 → 3710.70] Christ's death
[3710.70 → 3711.90] has secured us.
[3712.78 → 3713.64] He's secured us.
[3713.70 → 3714.94] He's secured our release
[3714.94 → 3716.40] from our union to the law
[3716.40 → 3717.42] and allows us
[3717.42 → 3718.74] to be married to Him now.
[3720.58 → 3721.94] Becoming a Christian then,
[3722.50 → 3723.46] becoming a Christian,
[3724.08 → 3725.72] is a complete change
[3725.72 → 3727.06] in our relationships
[3727.06 → 3728.38] and our allegiances.
[3729.84 → 3730.20] You see,
[3730.24 → 3731.00] when you get married,
[3731.28 → 3732.50] no part of your life
[3732.50 → 3733.26] goes unchanged.
[3734.02 → 3735.58] You no longer make decisions
[3735.58 → 3736.80] regarding just yourself.
[3737.20 → 3738.08] You make decisions
[3738.08 → 3739.26] based on the relationship
[3739.26 → 3741.02] you have with your spouse.
[3741.10 → 3741.42] In essence,
[3741.80 → 3742.82] you lose a little bit
[3742.82 → 3743.48] of your autonomy.
[3743.98 → 3745.22] You lose your freedom
[3745.22 → 3747.24] because you are now
[3747.24 → 3747.78] going to live
[3747.78 → 3748.26] for the person
[3748.26 → 3748.90] that you marry.
[3750.76 → 3751.12] However,
[3751.60 → 3752.98] you also gain a love
[3752.98 → 3753.72] and an intimacy
[3753.72 → 3755.36] that you didn't have before.
[3755.72 → 3756.70] So while you sacrifice
[3756.70 → 3757.44] your autonomy,
[3758.00 → 3758.96] gain an intimacy
[3758.96 → 3761.24] that was not experienced
[3761.24 → 3761.78] beforehand.
[3764.30 → 3765.06] Tim Keller,
[3765.28 → 3766.36] who actually sadly
[3766.36 → 3767.36] passed away this week
[3767.36 → 3768.36] after a three-year battle
[3768.36 → 3768.94] with cancer,
[3769.76 → 3770.54] he had this to say
[3770.54 → 3771.36] about this passage
[3771.36 → 3773.12] in reference to marriage
[3773.12 → 3774.26] but also in reference
[3774.26 → 3774.98] to our marriage
[3774.98 → 3775.58] with Christ.
[3776.18 → 3776.94] Tim Keller says this,
[3777.00 → 3777.26] he says,
[3777.60 → 3778.70] because of this love
[3778.70 → 3779.48] and intimacy,
[3780.18 → 3781.86] our loss of freedom
[3781.86 → 3782.64] is a joy,
[3783.12 → 3783.86] not a burden.
[3783.86 → 3785.64] In a good marriage,
[3785.72 → 3786.44] your whole life
[3786.44 → 3787.60] is affected and changed
[3787.60 → 3789.26] by the wishes and desires
[3789.26 → 3790.18] of the person you love.
[3790.38 → 3791.42] You seek to discover
[3791.42 → 3792.58] the wishes of your beloved
[3792.58 → 3794.78] and are happy to make changes
[3794.78 → 3796.64] in accord with those wishes.
[3800.24 → 3801.68] Now we're married to Christ
[3801.68 → 3804.04] and our whole life
[3804.04 → 3806.02] is affected by Jesus.
[3807.30 → 3809.12] Christ now pursues you.
[3809.12 → 3810.84] He loves you intimately.
[3811.38 → 3812.36] There is no area
[3812.36 → 3813.06] of your life
[3813.06 → 3813.82] that is untouched
[3813.82 → 3814.60] by His grace,
[3814.88 → 3815.68] by His mercy,
[3815.96 → 3816.72] by His love,
[3817.44 → 3820.30] but also by His callings.
[3821.88 → 3823.12] Your whole life
[3823.66 → 3824.64] is touched
[3824.64 → 3825.76] and changed
[3825.76 → 3826.74] by the calling
[3826.74 → 3827.70] He has for you.
[3828.68 → 3829.62] And when I say calling,
[3829.72 → 3831.20] I'm not talking about
[3831.20 → 3832.12] like the schools
[3832.12 → 3833.24] that you need to apply for
[3833.24 → 3833.88] or the jobs
[3833.88 → 3834.56] you need to have
[3834.56 → 3835.16] or the places
[3835.16 → 3836.22] you might need to move to.
[3836.50 → 3837.68] Those all can be things
[3837.68 → 3838.58] that God calls you to.
[3838.58 → 3839.12] That is true.
[3839.38 → 3840.74] But more often than not,
[3841.42 → 3842.88] God's calling on your life
[3842.88 → 3843.74] is not the decisions
[3843.74 → 3844.60] you have to make,
[3844.78 → 3846.10] but the way in which
[3846.10 → 3847.26] you are supposed to live.
[3848.24 → 3850.22] The fruit that you are called to bear.
[3851.60 → 3853.50] With our new union with Christ,
[3853.62 → 3854.64] our bonds to sin,
[3855.10 → 3856.90] our bonds to sin,
[3857.00 → 3857.42] to death,
[3857.50 → 3858.04] to destruction,
[3858.14 → 3858.58] they're broken.
[3859.72 → 3861.28] And we are called to live
[3861.28 → 3862.02] for Jesus,
[3862.40 → 3863.44] to bear His fruit.
[3863.74 → 3864.64] Verse 4 of our text,
[3864.74 → 3865.96] we belong to Him
[3865.96 → 3867.80] who was raised from the dead
[3867.80 → 3869.10] in order that we
[3869.10 → 3870.62] might bear fruit
[3870.62 → 3871.80] for God.
[3873.18 → 3874.20] Obedience to Christ
[3874.20 → 3875.04] and bearing fruit
[3875.04 → 3876.04] for God,
[3876.10 → 3877.42] that becomes the application
[3877.42 → 3878.04] for today.
[3879.60 → 3880.48] So now,
[3881.24 → 3883.02] we don't obey the law
[3883.02 → 3883.72] as a means
[3883.72 → 3884.70] to gain salvation.
[3884.92 → 3886.12] That was never going to work
[3886.12 → 3886.74] anyway.
[3887.76 → 3888.10] However,
[3888.20 → 3888.84] in our union
[3888.84 → 3889.94] with Christ,
[3890.46 → 3891.50] we want
[3891.50 → 3892.24] to follow
[3892.24 → 3893.06] the law
[3893.06 → 3894.18] because that is
[3894.18 → 3895.58] our joyful response
[3895.58 → 3896.56] to our groom,
[3896.70 → 3897.38] Jesus Christ.
[3898.60 → 3899.32] In other words,
[3899.50 → 3900.62] we're not trying
[3900.62 → 3901.60] to earn salvation
[3901.60 → 3902.78] by obeying the law,
[3903.20 → 3904.52] but by our union
[3904.52 → 3905.20] with Christ,
[3905.34 → 3906.36] for love of Him
[3906.36 → 3907.46] and for His love for us,
[3907.62 → 3908.36] we want
[3908.36 → 3909.26] to strive
[3909.26 → 3910.28] for righteousness
[3910.28 → 3911.42] that obedience
[3911.42 → 3912.46] to the law brings.
[3912.46 → 3914.66] That concept
[3914.66 → 3916.16] reframes everything.
[3917.90 → 3919.00] I'll give you an example,
[3919.16 → 3919.74] and maybe it's a bit
[3919.74 → 3920.54] of a stereotypical
[3920.54 → 3921.42] youth pastor example,
[3921.42 → 3922.00] but that's fine
[3922.00 → 3922.86] because Paul brings it up
[3922.86 → 3923.36] and I actually
[3923.36 → 3923.98] am a youth pastor.
[3924.98 → 3925.42] Sometimes,
[3925.82 → 3926.60] I hear a question
[3926.60 → 3927.46] from a young person
[3927.46 → 3928.30] or actually even
[3928.30 → 3928.98] an older person
[3928.98 → 3929.88] to be honest with you.
[3930.40 → 3931.90] How far is too far
[3931.90 → 3934.88] when it comes
[3934.88 → 3935.94] to my physical relationship
[3935.94 → 3936.58] with my boyfriend
[3936.58 → 3937.02] or girlfriend?
[3937.20 → 3938.38] How far is too far?
[3938.98 → 3940.20] Like at what point
[3940.20 → 3941.40] is it a sin?
[3942.46 → 3943.62] How far is too far?
[3944.66 → 3946.02] But that very question
[3946.02 → 3948.08] is a question
[3948.08 → 3948.92] that's framed
[3948.92 → 3951.60] from the perspective
[3951.60 → 3952.32] of being married
[3952.32 → 3952.88] to the law.
[3953.94 → 3954.96] See, we use the law
[3954.96 → 3955.70] as a barometer
[3955.70 → 3956.48] in that question
[3956.48 → 3957.34] for our actions,
[3957.60 → 3958.74] and we try to figure out
[3958.74 → 3959.76] how far we can go
[3959.76 → 3960.30] without actually
[3960.30 → 3961.12] breaking something,
[3961.38 → 3962.38] without breaking a rule.
[3962.46 → 3962.82] We wonder,
[3963.08 → 3963.64] at what point
[3963.64 → 3964.70] does sin kick in
[3964.70 → 3966.64] and the law take over
[3966.64 → 3967.66] and am I going
[3967.66 → 3969.50] against God's will
[3969.50 → 3970.46] in the law
[3970.46 → 3971.20] for your life
[3971.20 → 3972.20] and at what point
[3972.20 → 3973.10] does God reject me
[3973.10 → 3973.70] for what I'm doing?
[3973.70 → 3977.70] But we're married
[3977.70 → 3978.58] to Christ now,
[3978.68 → 3979.16] so that's not
[3979.16 → 3979.86] how that works.
[3980.00 → 3980.68] Instead of asking
[3980.68 → 3982.12] how far is too far,
[3982.88 → 3984.70] this reframes everything.
[3984.90 → 3986.00] The right question is,
[3986.54 → 3987.42] is not how far
[3987.42 → 3987.94] is too far,
[3988.00 → 3988.76] the right question is
[3988.76 → 3990.42] how am I pursuing Christ
[3990.42 → 3991.32] in this relationship?
[3992.26 → 3993.54] How am I pursuing Christ
[3993.54 → 3994.30] in my relationship
[3994.30 → 3995.00] with my boyfriend
[3995.00 → 3995.50] or girlfriend?
[3996.18 → 3997.64] Where is Christ here?
[3998.86 → 3999.70] See, the reframing
[4000.32 → 4001.16] of that question
[4001.16 → 4002.44] is going to provide you
[4002.44 → 4003.46] with much better guidance
[4003.46 → 4004.28] on how to move forward,
[4004.52 → 4005.46] not just with your boyfriend
[4005.46 → 4005.88] and girlfriend,
[4006.00 → 4007.02] but with any relationship.
[4008.42 → 4009.62] You have to reframe
[4009.62 → 4010.30] the question
[4010.30 → 4012.46] to reflect our marriage
[4012.46 → 4013.02] to Christ,
[4013.16 → 4014.04] not our relationship
[4014.04 → 4014.76] to the law.
[4015.26 → 4015.88] Now that's true
[4015.88 → 4016.68] with the example
[4016.68 → 4017.24] I just said
[4017.24 → 4017.84] with your boyfriend
[4017.84 → 4018.86] or girlfriend relationships,
[4019.10 → 4020.22] but it covers all areas
[4020.22 → 4021.02] of your life.
[4021.42 → 4022.12] Instead of asking,
[4022.44 → 4023.16] is this gossip
[4023.16 → 4024.58] or how much can I say
[4024.58 → 4025.40] here appropriately,
[4025.96 → 4027.58] ask how am I honouring Christ
[4027.58 → 4029.40] with what I'm speaking here?
[4030.22 → 4030.88] Instead of asking,
[4031.10 → 4032.04] is this greedy?
[4032.04 → 4032.88] Am I being greedy?
[4033.26 → 4035.48] Ask, how am I pursuing Christ
[4035.48 → 4036.28] in these initiatives?
[4037.32 → 4038.00] Instead of asking,
[4038.42 → 4039.86] how much can I get away with?
[4040.34 → 4041.74] Ask, how close am I
[4041.74 → 4042.90] to Christ at this moment?
[4045.10 → 4045.90] See, our obedience
[4045.90 → 4046.44] to the law
[4046.44 → 4047.22] is not something
[4047.22 → 4048.80] we used to gauge
[4048.80 → 4050.42] our sonometer
[4050.42 → 4051.90] to see how far
[4051.90 → 4052.40] we can go
[4052.40 → 4053.26] before we cross
[4053.26 → 4054.42] the threshold
[4054.42 → 4055.22] of wickedness,
[4055.76 → 4057.60] but rather,
[4058.56 → 4059.18] our obedience
[4059.18 → 4059.92] to the law
[4059.92 → 4060.40] is used
[4060.40 → 4060.76] as a way
[4060.76 → 4061.54] to demonstrate
[4061.54 → 4062.68] our love
[4062.68 → 4063.50] for Jesus,
[4064.08 → 4064.78] to show him
[4064.78 → 4065.70] that we love him
[4065.70 → 4067.42] and show the world
[4067.42 → 4068.26] around us
[4068.26 → 4069.36] that we are
[4069.36 → 4070.38] his disciples,
[4070.52 → 4071.14] that we are
[4071.14 → 4071.92] his bride.
[4074.56 → 4075.94] Now more than that though,
[4076.36 → 4077.18] the reframing
[4077.18 → 4078.44] of why we obey the law,
[4078.50 → 4079.18] it should change
[4079.18 → 4080.48] actually what we pursue
[4080.48 → 4081.28] in this life.
[4081.28 → 4085.40] when we start
[4085.40 → 4086.06] living out
[4086.06 → 4087.22] this love of Christ
[4087.22 → 4087.90] in our lives,
[4088.06 → 4089.88] we start pursuing him
[4089.88 → 4090.56] and the things
[4090.56 → 4091.52] that Jesus loves.
[4092.38 → 4093.10] So just like
[4093.10 → 4093.88] in your relationships
[4093.88 → 4094.66] here with people
[4094.66 → 4095.12] on earth,
[4095.92 → 4096.44] and marriage
[4096.44 → 4097.14] is a perfect
[4097.14 → 4097.86] example of this,
[4097.90 → 4098.68] so it's a perfect
[4098.68 → 4098.98] example,
[4099.10 → 4099.62] but you can also
[4099.62 → 4100.42] think of your friendships
[4100.42 → 4101.06] or your other
[4101.06 → 4102.00] relationships as well.
[4103.26 → 4104.70] You learn to love
[4104.70 → 4105.42] the things
[4105.42 → 4107.14] or pursue the things
[4107.14 → 4108.24] that your loved ones
[4108.24 → 4108.54] love.
[4108.54 → 4110.06] Right?
[4110.12 → 4110.74] So I've taken
[4110.74 → 4111.80] to loving my cat.
[4112.00 → 4112.82] I've never liked
[4112.82 → 4113.70] cats in my life.
[4114.06 → 4114.44] Honestly,
[4114.62 → 4115.46] just never have.
[4115.64 → 4116.68] But Nikki loves cats
[4116.68 → 4117.70] and my daughters
[4117.70 → 4118.40] love cats
[4118.40 → 4119.56] and so now
[4119.56 → 4120.40] I love our cat.
[4121.26 → 4122.32] It's just true.
[4122.60 → 4123.24] She also kills
[4123.24 → 4124.08] a lot of moles
[4124.08 → 4125.14] and a lot of mice
[4125.14 → 4125.86] and I'm a big fan
[4125.86 → 4126.40] of that too.
[4127.46 → 4127.76] Also,
[4127.86 → 4128.64] I'm reading now
[4128.64 → 4129.48] more than I ever have
[4129.48 → 4129.98] in my life.
[4130.44 → 4130.94] Partly because
[4130.94 → 4131.54] I'm in school
[4131.54 → 4132.90] but also because
[4132.90 → 4134.06] my wife loves to read
[4134.06 → 4135.46] but also the two guys
[4135.46 → 4136.18] that I work with
[4136.18 → 4137.42] who I also love dearly
[4137.42 → 4138.90] love reading
[4138.90 → 4140.46] and absorbing knowledge.
[4141.10 → 4141.78] So here I am
[4141.78 → 4142.36] reading Keller
[4142.36 → 4142.80] and Root
[4142.80 → 4143.16] and Smith
[4143.16 → 4143.58] and Taylor
[4143.58 → 4144.60] with more regularity
[4144.60 → 4145.40] than ever before.
[4146.30 → 4147.16] I also watch
[4147.16 → 4148.30] every single shark movie
[4148.30 → 4148.86] that comes out
[4148.86 → 4149.26] to theatres
[4149.26 → 4150.28] because I've got friends
[4150.28 → 4151.56] who love shark movies
[4151.56 → 4152.50] and I'm right there
[4152.50 → 4152.96] with them
[4152.96 → 4153.82] in the theatre
[4153.82 → 4154.60] spending $15
[4154.60 → 4155.68] even if those movies
[4155.68 → 4156.42] are absolute garbage.
[4157.72 → 4159.10] We learn to love
[4159.10 → 4159.64] the things
[4159.64 → 4160.70] our loved ones love.
[4161.40 → 4162.68] We pursue the things
[4162.68 → 4163.72] our loved ones love.
[4165.12 → 4166.00] With Jesus,
[4166.20 → 4167.12] when we love him,
[4168.08 → 4169.04] we should be pursuing
[4169.04 → 4169.78] the things
[4169.78 → 4170.66] pursuing the things
[4170.66 → 4171.18] that he loves
[4171.18 → 4172.62] pursuing the fruits
[4172.62 → 4173.52] of the spirit.
[4173.64 → 4174.56] That's what our text says.
[4174.90 → 4175.90] We are bearing
[4175.90 → 4177.54] the fruits for God.
[4178.16 → 4178.60] This means
[4178.60 → 4179.54] rather than treating
[4179.54 → 4180.74] the things of this world
[4180.74 → 4181.68] that Jesus loves
[4181.68 → 4182.92] sort of as options
[4182.92 → 4185.40] or like daily things
[4185.40 → 4185.92] that we can
[4185.92 → 4186.62] or cannot do,
[4187.30 → 4188.18] we should be growing
[4188.18 → 4188.76] in them.
[4188.84 → 4190.36] We should be pursuing them.
[4190.42 → 4191.54] We should be practicing them,
[4191.66 → 4192.22] living them out
[4192.22 → 4192.94] in our lives.
[4193.56 → 4194.34] The kids right now
[4194.34 → 4194.82] in our church,
[4195.02 → 4196.10] they're in children's worship time.
[4196.10 → 4196.78] They're talking about
[4196.78 → 4197.68] the fruits of the spirit
[4197.68 → 4198.66] and they're going to be doing that
[4198.66 → 4199.50] for the next few weeks.
[4200.10 → 4200.62] Those fruits,
[4200.72 → 4201.28] they're all listed
[4201.28 → 4202.16] in Galatians 5.
[4202.24 → 4202.94] I'm sure some of you
[4202.94 → 4203.38] know songs
[4203.38 → 4204.18] that you could list them.
[4204.68 → 4206.14] But those are perfect examples
[4206.14 → 4207.74] of things that Jesus loves.
[4208.48 → 4209.86] And they're perfect examples
[4209.86 → 4211.60] of what we should be growing in
[4211.60 → 4212.30] because of Christ,
[4212.44 → 4212.82] our groom.
[4214.04 → 4214.62] For example,
[4216.22 → 4217.60] you've got decisions to make.
[4218.10 → 4219.26] You can grow in love
[4219.26 → 4221.92] or you can love others
[4221.92 → 4222.60] as commodities,
[4223.12 → 4224.08] doing away with people
[4224.08 → 4225.44] when they become of no use to you.
[4226.34 → 4227.60] You can grow in joy
[4227.60 → 4229.36] or you can choose
[4229.36 → 4230.04] to view the world
[4230.04 → 4231.14] around you apathetically.
[4232.20 → 4233.50] You can grow in peace
[4233.50 → 4235.12] or you can stir up gossip
[4235.12 → 4236.04] among your community.
[4236.40 → 4237.52] You can grow in patience
[4237.52 → 4239.52] or you can live impatiently.
[4239.70 → 4240.80] You can grow in kindness
[4240.80 → 4242.52] or you can dwell in ignorance.
[4243.26 → 4244.36] You can grow in goodness
[4244.36 → 4245.90] or you can breed disloyalty.
[4246.28 → 4247.60] You can grow in faithfulness
[4247.60 → 4248.74] or you can flip-flop
[4248.74 → 4250.28] on your friends and your God.
[4250.44 → 4251.66] You can grow in gentleness
[4251.66 → 4253.04] or you can be abrasive
[4253.04 → 4253.70] in the relationships
[4253.70 → 4254.38] that you have.
[4254.58 → 4256.44] You can grow in self-control
[4256.44 → 4258.36] or you can do whatever you want.
[4260.00 → 4261.36] Our marriage to Christ
[4261.36 → 4262.94] changes everything
[4262.94 → 4264.40] about the way we live.
[4265.46 → 4266.96] We are called to live
[4266.96 → 4268.34] how He wants us to live
[4268.34 → 4271.02] because we want to please Him.
[4271.68 → 4273.82] He wants to please us.
[4273.94 → 4275.04] We want to please Him.
[4275.14 → 4276.06] That's how this intimate
[4276.06 → 4277.16] relationship works.
[4277.54 → 4279.04] So when sin tempts us now,
[4279.42 → 4280.16] we can remember
[4280.16 → 4281.42] that through Christ's death
[4281.42 → 4282.48] and resurrection,
[4283.56 → 4284.92] we died as well
[4284.92 → 4286.14] and were resurrected
[4286.14 → 4287.48] into this new life.
[4288.02 → 4288.90] We have the ability
[4288.90 → 4290.58] to pursue our new love,
[4290.72 → 4291.58] Jesus Christ,
[4292.02 → 4294.10] and grow in the fruit
[4294.10 → 4295.20] that He calls us to bear.
[4297.22 → 4298.38] Verse 5 and 6.
[4299.38 → 4300.34] For when we were
[4300.34 → 4301.46] in the realm of the flesh,
[4301.58 → 4302.56] the sinful passions
[4302.56 → 4305.08] aroused us by the law
[4305.08 → 4306.22] were at work in us
[4306.22 → 4308.16] so that we bore fruit for death.
[4308.16 → 4309.84] But now by dying
[4309.84 → 4311.12] to what once bound us,
[4311.34 → 4312.66] we have been released
[4312.66 → 4313.80] from the law
[4313.80 → 4314.70] so that we serve
[4314.70 → 4315.30] in the new way
[4315.30 → 4315.82] of the Spirit.
[4317.90 → 4319.32] So please take this home
[4319.32 → 4319.88] with you today.
[4320.82 → 4322.06] We are now bound
[4322.06 → 4322.88] with Christ,
[4323.12 → 4324.58] bearing fruit for God.
[4326.00 → 4327.60] Not for means of salvation,
[4327.80 → 4328.90] but because we are bound
[4328.90 → 4330.18] to Christ in a new life,
[4330.42 → 4331.28] in a new marriage,
[4331.52 → 4332.24] in new hope,
[4332.62 → 4333.58] and in a new calling
[4333.58 → 4335.10] to love what our Saviour loves
[4335.10 → 4335.78] and pursue
[4335.78 → 4337.18] what our Saviour loves.
[4337.18 → 4337.58] And so,
[4337.74 → 4339.04] with grateful joy
[4339.04 → 4340.52] and intimate love
[4340.52 → 4341.34] for our groom,
[4341.80 → 4342.60] Christ's bride,
[4342.72 → 4343.48] all of us,
[4344.48 → 4345.96] we can live in this world
[4345.96 → 4347.66] called and compelled
[4347.66 → 4349.20] to produce the fruits
[4349.20 → 4349.86] of the Spirit
[4349.86 → 4351.00] which God loves
[4351.00 → 4352.20] so much.
[4353.68 → 4356.10] May we pursue Christ
[4356.10 → 4357.84] always and forever.
[4358.06 → 4358.46] Let's pray.
[4358.46 → 4358.54] Amen.
[4362.36 → 4363.54] Father in heaven,
[4363.54 → 4365.60] God,
[4365.68 → 4366.26] we are
[4366.26 → 4369.80] unbelievably grateful
[4369.80 → 4371.70] for your death
[4371.70 → 4372.36] and resurrection,
[4373.10 → 4373.22] Lord,
[4373.26 → 4374.42] because as you died
[4374.42 → 4375.44] to defeat sin and death,
[4375.56 → 4377.10] we are able to die with you
[4377.10 → 4378.00] and have been reborn.
[4378.60 → 4380.00] And now we are not bound
[4380.00 → 4380.74] to the law.
[4380.84 → 4381.60] We are not bound
[4381.60 → 4382.60] to sin anymore.
[4382.70 → 4383.78] We are bound to you,
[4384.12 → 4385.86] the Saviour of all things.
[4386.52 → 4386.72] And so,
[4386.80 → 4386.94] God,
[4386.98 → 4388.90] may we not look at the law
[4388.90 → 4390.22] or look at the sins
[4390.22 → 4390.72] of this world
[4390.72 → 4391.28] as something
[4391.28 → 4392.86] that is a checklist
[4392.86 → 4393.98] that we are checking
[4393.98 → 4395.18] or that you are keeping score of,
[4395.22 → 4395.78] but rather,
[4396.20 → 4397.74] may we look to the law
[4397.74 → 4398.92] and see it for what it is,
[4399.30 → 4400.38] markers of righteousness
[4400.38 → 4402.14] for you.
[4402.90 → 4404.44] May we live our
[4404.44 → 4405.80] pursuing and bearing
[4405.80 → 4407.14] the fruits of the Spirit.
[4409.06 → 4410.86] May we show your love
[4410.86 → 4411.96] to each other
[4411.96 → 4414.06] and to the world around us,
[4414.72 → 4416.54] not so that you will save us,
[4416.58 → 4416.94] because God,
[4417.00 → 4417.84] you've done that already,
[4418.54 → 4420.18] but so that they will see
[4420.18 → 4421.62] that you are king
[4421.62 → 4424.12] and that they will see
[4424.12 → 4426.56] that you are our groom
[4426.56 → 4428.30] and we are your bride
[4428.30 → 4429.04] and your disciples.
[4430.30 → 4431.78] May that be the focal point
[4431.78 → 4433.80] of our lives going forward.
[4433.92 → 4434.68] In your name we pray.
[4434.88 → 4435.08] Amen.
[4435.08 → 4435.18] Amen.
[4435.18 → 4435.24] Amen.
[4435.24 → 4435.30] Amen.
[4435.30 → 4437.24] Amen.
[4437.24 → 4439.24] Amen.

[4445.24 → 4447.24] Amen.
[4447.24 → 4447.30] Amen.
[4447.30 → 4447.32] Amen.
[4447.32 → 4447.36] Amen.
[4447.36 → 4447.42] Amen.
[4447.42 → 4448.36] Amen.
[4448.36 → 4448.42] Amen.
[4448.42 → 4449.42] Amen.
[4449.42 → 4449.50] Amen.
[4450.18 → 4465.32] Amen.
[4479.82 → 4480.16] Amen.
[4480.16 → 4492.16] to serve but to serve and gave your life that we might live
[4492.16 → 4505.54] this is our god the servant king he calls us now to follow him
[4505.54 → 4519.54] to bring on us as a daily offering of worship to the servant king

[4534.14 → 4541.14] his heart with sorrow was torn
[4541.14 → 4548.14] yet not my will but yours he said
