[401.68 --> 405.54]  And lead me in your love

[433.78 --> 434.44]  And when I have, word
[434.44 --> 435.32]  And the information
[435.32 --> 436.46]  So, you know what would you
[436.46 --> 466.44]  I'll see you next time.
[466.46 --> 496.44]  I'll see you next time.
[496.44 --> 497.60]  Good morning.
[500.02 --> 503.86]  Welcome into our worship together this morning.
[504.34 --> 505.14]  My name is Chris.
[505.40 --> 506.74]  I'm one of the pastors here.
[507.08 --> 512.00]  If you're visiting with us this morning, in person or online, we're super excited that
[512.00 --> 514.62]  you are here and we'd love to connect with you.
[514.80 --> 518.42]  And so at some point in your seats, there are Connect cards.
[518.56 --> 523.36]  Feel free to fill one of those out and put it in the collection bag as it comes around,
[523.36 --> 527.04]  or there's a QR code that you can scan and that will give you a digital form.
[527.14 --> 530.54]  We'd love to hear from you, see how we can connect together.
[531.34 --> 539.12]  As we worship our God on this beautiful Sunday morning, we come as people with all sorts of
[539.12 --> 543.08]  different stories and different circumstances, different needs, different prayers, different
[543.08 --> 545.48]  celebrations, different cries of the heart.
[545.48 --> 549.86]  We come and we bring them all into the presence of our God together.
[550.66 --> 554.28]  And so as you are able, and where you are, I'm going to invite you to stand.
[554.76 --> 556.66]  We can receive God's greeting together.
[557.90 --> 563.94]  After God's greeting, give you an opportunity just to welcome those around you into our worship
[563.94 --> 564.34]  together.
[564.34 --> 568.26]  Just a reminder, not everybody likes to be welcomed with a hug.
[569.36 --> 574.82]  And so a fist bump or a nod of the head may be adequate or appropriate for some people.
[574.94 --> 578.68]  Just, you know, discern the situation you find yourself in.
[579.56 --> 584.92]  We gather together as God's people and so receive the greeting of our God.
[584.92 --> 593.88]  grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, Son, and
[593.88 --> 597.24]  our Savior, through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[598.24 --> 598.70]  Amen.
[614.92 --> 636.76]  Good morning.
[637.10 --> 639.00]  Welcome to worship this morning.
[639.00 --> 645.62]  A.W. Tozer, in his book, The Pursuit of God, wrote this.
[646.52 --> 652.80]  Has it ever occurred to you that 100 pianos, all tuned to the same tuning fork, are automatically
[652.80 --> 653.86]  tuned to each other?
[654.44 --> 660.08]  They are of one accord by being tuned not to each other, but to another standard to which
[660.08 --> 662.68]  each one must individually bow.
[663.68 --> 668.98]  After thinking on this this week, I realized that the truth is a tuned piano can quickly go
[668.98 --> 674.66]  out of tune depending on its environment, where it has been, or how it has been used, and
[674.66 --> 676.52]  needs to be retuned regularly.
[677.90 --> 679.46]  Worship is like a tuning fork.
[680.74 --> 687.26]  Worship is, coming to worship on Sundays is an opportunity for us to come back to who we
[687.26 --> 694.22]  are in light of who God is, to lift our eyes higher, and to remind us who we are in God's
[694.22 --> 694.58]  eyes.
[695.04 --> 697.94]  So our call to worship this morning is Psalm 117.
[697.94 --> 700.30]  Praise the Lord, all you nations.
[700.48 --> 702.12]  Extol him, all you people.
[702.68 --> 707.06]  For great is his love toward us, and the faithfulness of the Lord endures forever.
[707.46 --> 708.34]  Praise the Lord.
[708.72 --> 709.66]  Let's worship together.
[709.66 --> 722.78]  Come, now is the time to worship.
[722.78 --> 737.70]  Come, now is the time to worship.
[739.54 --> 746.92]  Come, now is the time to live your life.
[746.92 --> 753.60]  Come, just as you are to worship.
[755.38 --> 762.80]  Come, just as you love me for your love.
[766.38 --> 770.54]  Make me every time you kiss your heart.
[770.54 --> 773.54]  Make me every year of love.
[773.54 --> 778.16]  Come, just as you are to worship.
[778.16 --> 790.84]  Come, now is the time to worship.
[790.84 --> 799.76]  Come, now is the time to live your life.
[799.76 --> 806.38]  Come, just as you are to worship.
[808.38 --> 812.38]  Come, just as you are to worship.
[812.38 --> 814.38]  Come, just as you are to worship.
[814.38 --> 819.00]  Come, just as you are to worship.
[819.00 --> 823.00]  Come, just as you are to worship.
[823.00 --> 827.00]  Come, just as you are to worship.
[827.00 --> 831.62]  Come, just as you are to worship.
[831.62 --> 836.62]  Come, just as you are to worship.
[836.62 --> 841.62]  Come, just as you are to worship.
[841.62 --> 846.24]  Come, just as you are to worship.
[846.30 --> 852.48]  come, just as you are to worship.
[852.48 --> 861.52]  Now, now is the time to worship
[861.52 --> 870.60]  Now, now is the time to give your heart
[870.60 --> 877.52]  Now, just as you are to worship
[877.52 --> 886.96]  Now, just as you are before your love
[886.96 --> 887.96]  Now
[907.52 --> 929.08]  Who has held the oceans in its hands?
[929.08 --> 934.62]  Who has covered every grain of sin?
[935.06 --> 940.30]  Kings and nations trampled on His voice
[940.30 --> 946.84]  All creation rises to His voice
[946.84 --> 954.32]  Oh, now, now, sing me on His song
[954.32 --> 957.86]  Come, let us know it
[957.86 --> 962.80]  Behold on Him
[962.80 --> 964.90]  God, we can't remember
[964.90 --> 969.84]  Come, let us know it
[969.84 --> 986.16]  Who has given counsel to the Lord
[986.16 --> 991.74]  Who can question any of His words
[991.74 --> 997.30]  Who can teach the one who knows all things
[997.30 --> 1003.30]  Who can fathom all His wondrous feet
[1003.30 --> 1008.52]  Oh, now, God
[1008.52 --> 1011.48]  Seated on His throne
[1011.48 --> 1015.28]  Come, let us adore Him
[1015.28 --> 1019.30]  Behold on Him
[1019.82 --> 1022.30]  Let Him compare
[1022.30 --> 1028.30]  God, let us adore Him
[1028.30 --> 1030.30]  Who has held the fields upon His hands
[1030.30 --> 1034.30]  Bearing all the guilt of sinful men
[1034.30 --> 1036.30]  God, eternal heart
[1036.30 --> 1037.30]  Behold on Him
[1037.30 --> 1039.30]  God, eternal heart
[1039.30 --> 1052.30]  God, eternal heart
[1052.30 --> 1054.30]  Humble to the grave
[1054.30 --> 1060.30]  Jesus, Savior, risen now to Him
[1060.30 --> 1062.30]  God, eternal heart
[1062.30 --> 1066.30]  God, eternal heart
[1066.30 --> 1068.30]  God, eternal heart
[1068.30 --> 1072.30]  Come, let us adore Him
[1072.30 --> 1076.30]  Behold on Him
[1076.30 --> 1078.30]  God, eternal heart
[1078.30 --> 1080.30]  Come, let us adore Him
[1080.30 --> 1090.30]  God, eternal heart
[1090.30 --> 1092.30]  You will be
[1092.30 --> 1094.30]  Your glory
[1094.30 --> 1096.30]  You will be
[1096.30 --> 1126.28]  Thank you.
[1126.30 --> 1156.28]  Thank you.
[1156.30 --> 1158.30]  Thank you.
[1187.26 --> 1190.52]  Please join me in our prayer of confession this morning.
[1190.52 --> 1192.52]  Thank you.
[1193.22 --> 1203.88]  Jesus, our Lord, you came to us humbly, born in a stable and later riding on a donkey toward your cruel death and sacrifice for us.
[1204.38 --> 1208.34]  In perfect love, you showed us the way we should live.
[1208.34 --> 1210.98]  Lord, we sing to you praise.
[1210.98 --> 1214.76]  We cast our eyes on you to worship and adore you.
[1215.66 --> 1223.78]  Lord, we confess that our vision wanders and is not always pure and is often stained with our own selfish desires.
[1225.14 --> 1229.06]  Forgive us, Lord, when our eyes are not set on the things of your kingdom.
[1229.06 --> 1236.90]  Forgive us, O Lord, when our mouths that seek to praise you often deny and defy you in what they say.
[1238.34 --> 1241.92]  Renew in us an obedient spirit, we pray.
[1241.92 --> 1247.86]  We come to you now, Lord, in a few moments of silent confession.
[1247.86 --> 1249.86]  Amen.
[1249.86 --> 1250.86]  Amen.
[1250.86 --> 1251.86]  Amen.

[1287.42 --> 1287.52]  Amen.
[1287.52 --> 1289.20]  Amen.
[1290.88 --> 1295.32]  God, our one and only true hope, restore us.
[1296.14 --> 1298.26]  Our times are in your hands, O God.
[1298.80 --> 1306.56]  Let your face shine upon us as we pursue your will in our lives and save us through your unfailing love.
[1307.42 --> 1308.66]  In your name we pray.
[1309.52 --> 1309.84]  Amen.
[1309.84 --> 1310.00]  Amen.
[1313.26 --> 1317.18]  This next song has some actions, which I know some of the children know,
[1317.42 --> 1320.58]  so if you'd like to follow along with that, that would be great.
[1320.68 --> 1321.90]  And please stand as we sing.
[1321.90 --> 1351.88]  Thank you.

[1801.50 --> 1803.08]  Of every human being
[1803.08 --> 1805.10]  They strive for a society
[1805.10 --> 1806.56]  In which every human life
[1806.56 --> 1807.22]  Is protected
[1807.22 --> 1808.18]  Respected
[1808.18 --> 1808.92]  And valued
[1808.92 --> 1809.96]  From conception
[1809.96 --> 1811.10]  Until natural death
[1811.10 --> 1812.14]  They believe
[1812.14 --> 1813.24]  That all human beings
[1813.24 --> 1814.42]  Have God-given value
[1814.42 --> 1815.02]  And are worthy
[1815.02 --> 1816.66]  Of respect and protection
[1816.66 --> 1818.18]  Regardless of their age
[1818.18 --> 1819.58]  Place of residence
[1819.58 --> 1820.70]  Stage of development
[1820.70 --> 1821.64]  State of health
[1821.64 --> 1822.92]  Or level of ability
[1822.92 --> 1825.06]  Advocate brings hope
[1825.06 --> 1826.12]  To women and families
[1826.12 --> 1827.38]  Through pregnancy counseling
[1827.38 --> 1828.10]  And resources
[1828.10 --> 1829.52]  Baby supplies
[1829.52 --> 1830.76]  Postpartum support
[1830.76 --> 1832.06]  Post-abortion care
[1832.06 --> 1833.80]  And community education
[1833.80 --> 1835.12]  They believe
[1835.12 --> 1836.22]  Everyone has value
[1836.22 --> 1838.00]  And they are here to help
[1838.00 --> 1839.64]  Next week's offering
[1839.64 --> 1841.18]  Is for the gateway of hope
[1841.18 --> 1842.34]  Let us give
[1842.34 --> 1843.90]  As the Lord has blessed us
[1851.64 --> 1864.26]  So we have trials
[1864.26 --> 1866.24]  And condition
[1866.24 --> 1872.74]  Everybody knows our great
[1872.74 --> 1874.68]  Isolation
[1874.68 --> 1881.74]  Lay our burdens down
[1881.74 --> 1885.88]  Lay our burdens down
[1885.88 --> 1889.88]  Never friendly heaven Jesus
[1889.88 --> 1892.24]  He's the worst one
[1892.24 --> 1894.18]  Seeds are wrong
[1894.18 --> 1896.38]  Bless Him, Christ, Lord
[1896.38 --> 1898.42]  Let He rise up
[1898.42 --> 1901.06]  Forever and ever
[1901.06 --> 1903.06]  His heart is alone
[1903.06 --> 1912.74]  Everybody has fears
[1912.74 --> 1914.74]  Everybody has worries
[1914.74 --> 1920.60]  Everybody has sorrow
[1920.60 --> 1923.20]  Devastation
[1923.20 --> 1929.88]  Lay our burdens down
[1929.88 --> 1933.96]  Lay our burdens down
[1933.96 --> 1938.04]  Let our friends live down in Jesus
[1938.04 --> 1939.56]  He's the worst one
[1939.56 --> 1941.56]  Seeds are wrong
[1941.56 --> 1945.56]  Every grace of every rising
[1945.56 --> 1947.56]  Forever and ever
[1947.56 --> 1951.56]  His heart is alone
[1951.56 --> 1957.24]  Lord, Lord, He's faithful
[1957.24 --> 1961.24]  He feels like a heart like a
[1961.24 --> 1963.24]  Running over and ever
[1963.24 --> 1964.68]  Let our betrayal
[1964.68 --> 1966.92]  For His faithful

[1970.92 --> 1972.92]  Lord, let our betrayal

[1978.92 --> 1982.92]  For His faithful
[1982.92 --> 1984.84]  Now He will

[1986.92 --> 1989.86]  And ab�
[1989.86 --> 1990.36]  Oh, Lord, let our знаем

[2022.50 --> 2026.54]  Forever and ever His heart is come.
[2029.60 --> 2044.18]  All right. I would love if there's any kids here this morning aged three through kindergarten,
[2045.08 --> 2049.96]  going into kindergarten or having just finished kindergarten, that is up to your parents to
[2049.96 --> 2056.36]  decide. But we want you to come up to the front. We're going to stand together. We're going to
[2056.36 --> 2062.40]  give you a little blessing, and then you're going to be on your way. I know that you've got some
[2062.40 --> 2068.78]  teachers who are excited to lead you in some children's worship time this morning. All right,
[2068.82 --> 2073.00]  so we're a small group up here this morning, so that means all y'all got to speak extra loud,
[2073.06 --> 2081.02]  all right? Can you stand with us too? That's right. Okay, so we're going to hold our hands up,
[2081.02 --> 2085.00]  and we're going to say, the Lord be with you, and then they're going to say, and also with you,
[2085.00 --> 2094.06]  back to us. Ready? Really loud. Ready? The Lord be with you. And also with you. Oh, excellent on both sides. Good job.
[2094.06 --> 2095.06]  Thank you.
[2095.06 --> 2096.06]  Thank you.
[2115.00 --> 2126.60]  Good morning. My name is Rob. I'm a member here, and I'd like to lead you in a time of family prayer.
[2126.60 --> 2136.96]  A few weeks ago, we started the Faith Hero series, and we opened with the opening verses of Hebrews 11,
[2137.38 --> 2144.52]  which is a chapter that paints such great word pictures. Now, faith is confidence in what we hope
[2144.52 --> 2151.10]  for and assurance about what we do not see. This is what the ancients were commended for.
[2151.10 --> 2159.86]  What our eyes see or don't see is a great theme that we see throughout the Bible, and I'd like to
[2159.86 --> 2166.40]  infuse some of that theme into our prayer this morning. And to help us do that, I'd like to just
[2166.40 --> 2172.96]  start with a few passages, and let's just tuck those back away in the back of our minds and reflect on
[2172.96 --> 2176.60]  them. The first one is from Ephesians chapter 1.
[2176.60 --> 2182.60]  I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope
[2182.60 --> 2188.82]  to which he has called you, the riches of his glorious inheritance in his holy people,
[2189.12 --> 2196.74]  and his incomparably great power for us who believe. That's a really complicated verse and sentence.
[2197.26 --> 2200.92]  There are three things in there that we can distill it down to. Let me read it again.
[2200.92 --> 2207.86]  I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you, one, may know the hope to which
[2207.86 --> 2214.82]  he has called you, the riches of his glorious inheritance in his holy people, and his incomparably
[2214.82 --> 2225.14]  great power for us who believe. 2 Corinthians 4. So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is
[2225.14 --> 2230.24]  unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.
[2230.92 --> 2237.96]  Then in Acts chapter 26, Paul is recounting what happened on the road to Damascus, where God says,
[2238.46 --> 2244.86]  I will rescue you from your own people and from the Gentiles. I'm sending you to them to open their eyes.
[2246.32 --> 2252.06]  Psalm 119, open my eyes that I may see the wonderful things in your law.
[2253.42 --> 2258.76]  There's lots. There's many more. Some may come to mind for you as well.
[2258.76 --> 2265.92]  I'd actually like to close our time of prayer with one more, and that's from the book of 2 Kings,
[2266.86 --> 2273.50]  which what was happening there was Elisha and the Israelites were under military threat from the Arameans,
[2273.72 --> 2280.18]  and they were about to get squashed. Now, I'm fairly certain that we probably don't have Arameans
[2280.18 --> 2285.36]  surrounding the sanctuary. If there are, then that means the ushers aren't doing their job.
[2286.92 --> 2293.32]  But I think most of us or all of us probably have figurative Arameans surrounding us.
[2296.60 --> 2303.64]  Before we pray as well, I'd like to go through some of the prayer concerns that were in the bulletin,
[2303.64 --> 2311.82]  or some updates on that. And first off, we know that Amy Bongers will be needing a second surgery to her eyes.
[2312.44 --> 2318.90]  We pray that that will go well and that she will have the patience to be able to deal with that.
[2319.70 --> 2326.10]  We also think of the Roersma family as Mike's mom is nearing the end of her life,
[2326.10 --> 2333.22]  and we pray for the family as they gather at the hospital and that you would provide a peace for the family
[2333.22 --> 2336.92]  and that the hope of Jesus would be known and experienced.
[2337.60 --> 2345.80]  We also think of the fire near Osoyos, and we know now that the town is under evacuation
[2345.80 --> 2349.74]  and the turmoil and upheaval that that has.
[2349.74 --> 2355.82]  We have members here who have property around there, people camping.
[2356.92 --> 2359.26]  What a challenge that that is.
[2360.36 --> 2364.68]  As well, in the bulletin, we've read about Amy Cron.
[2364.86 --> 2371.50]  We pray for her treatments and also for Dan Howling's father and his recovery.
[2372.40 --> 2376.82]  And we've also been praying for Louise Condos' family
[2376.82 --> 2380.80]  and the recoveries for Ellen White and Mahré.
[2382.24 --> 2383.64]  Let's pray together.
[2385.38 --> 2388.00]  We praise you, God, for creating this universe,
[2388.50 --> 2390.42]  that it was formed at your command,
[2390.78 --> 2394.36]  so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible.
[2395.30 --> 2398.66]  Even with our powerful telescopes and space voyages,
[2398.90 --> 2403.38]  humanity has not even scratched the surface of what can be seen.
[2403.38 --> 2406.98]  All creation lights up with a reflection of its maker.
[2407.86 --> 2411.88]  At the other end of the spectrum, we think of the ministry of advocate,
[2412.44 --> 2415.42]  who draw our attention to the tiny unborn child,
[2415.82 --> 2418.52]  not literally seen, but very real.
[2419.88 --> 2421.58]  Father, we praise you for your law.
[2421.78 --> 2424.32]  Your word guides us in the way that we should go.
[2425.36 --> 2427.22]  Yet, we fall short.
[2428.20 --> 2429.90]  Firstly, we keep our eyes closed.
[2429.90 --> 2433.64]  At times, it's easier to close our eyes to what's going on around us.
[2434.26 --> 2437.84]  At times, we're overwhelmed with the brokenness in the world around us.
[2439.00 --> 2442.04]  Forgive us for willingly shutting out what we know is right
[2442.04 --> 2443.98]  and from doing what is good.
[2445.42 --> 2448.80]  Secondly, we see, but we don't live by your standards.
[2449.82 --> 2452.52]  At times, it's easier just to stay where we're at.
[2453.24 --> 2455.46]  You direct us to live our lives of faith,
[2455.66 --> 2458.56]  but it can be more comfortable just to let things slide.
[2458.56 --> 2463.34]  Forgive us for failing to act and doing what we know is right.
[2464.52 --> 2466.30]  Thirdly, we look elsewhere.
[2466.96 --> 2469.24]  Forgive us when we choose to do what is wrong.
[2469.72 --> 2474.46]  Forgive us when we choose ourselves or we choose temporal things above you.
[2475.32 --> 2479.38]  We pray, Lord, that your spirit would flood us to open our eyes,
[2479.86 --> 2482.82]  help us to be and do what you have planned for us,
[2482.92 --> 2485.48]  and help us to stop looking elsewhere.
[2485.48 --> 2491.82]  We come to you with thanks this morning for the great gifts that our spiritual eyes can see.
[2492.82 --> 2495.44]  We thank you for the hope to which you call us,
[2495.76 --> 2497.58]  the riches of your glorious inheritance,
[2498.00 --> 2500.52]  and the great power for us who believe.
[2501.62 --> 2504.76]  All these can help us not just cope with our daily lives,
[2505.12 --> 2507.58]  but help us to thrive in our service to you.
[2507.58 --> 2510.12]  We thank you for this church.
[2510.36 --> 2513.50]  Although we fail, we are grateful for the good things,
[2513.92 --> 2517.98]  for the cloud of witnesses that testify to your faithfulness and encourage us.
[2518.76 --> 2520.34]  Thank you for the church worldwide,
[2520.84 --> 2524.18]  with so many people living out their faith in so many ways,
[2524.26 --> 2526.34]  so many places, so many faces.
[2527.30 --> 2529.58]  Thank you for the church of all ages,
[2530.18 --> 2533.40]  that cloud of witnesses that goes before us
[2533.40 --> 2535.62]  and that will undoubtedly follow us.
[2535.62 --> 2539.68]  Father, we pray for the faces of our own church.
[2540.22 --> 2542.58]  We think of Amy needing surgery,
[2542.92 --> 2545.20]  and Amy Cron as well.
[2545.46 --> 2548.48]  We think of the Roersma family as they're gathered just up the hill.
[2549.06 --> 2553.92]  Lord, bless their time together as they expect their mother to pass away.
[2554.82 --> 2558.92]  Father, we pray for those in Osoyos who need to make decisions
[2558.92 --> 2563.74]  and leave their homes and deal with all the upheaval with that.
[2564.70 --> 2568.74]  We pray for Dan Howling's father and Louise Condos' family.
[2569.22 --> 2574.04]  Lord, we thank you for the recoveries for Ellen and for Mahre.
[2574.04 --> 2580.38]  We pray for the things that don't make it into the bulletin
[2580.38 --> 2584.04]  or the things that used to be in the bulletin but have not been forgotten,
[2584.50 --> 2588.84]  for physical challenges, aging challenges, housing challenges,
[2589.20 --> 2593.08]  the challenges of raising children or broken relationships.
[2593.56 --> 2596.74]  Give us eyes to see that our afflictions are temporary
[2596.74 --> 2601.96]  and don't compare with the glory that is awaiting us.
[2602.62 --> 2604.20]  We pray again for our advocate,
[2604.48 --> 2608.60]  that they may inspire women and families to see your goodness
[2608.60 --> 2609.90]  and your graciousness.
[2610.98 --> 2612.90]  We thank you for the rain a week ago.
[2613.28 --> 2616.32]  We pray that this summer season may recharge us from our labors,
[2616.50 --> 2620.38]  and when we do things and experience things that we might not do otherwise,
[2620.38 --> 2625.16]  that this might lead us to a new perspective and a new focus for the year ahead.
[2626.78 --> 2629.30]  Father, we pray for Marg on Township Council.
[2630.04 --> 2632.16]  Thank you that she can serve in this role.
[2632.36 --> 2635.34]  We pray that you give her the wisdom and the insight
[2635.34 --> 2637.62]  to serve in such a unique way.
[2638.66 --> 2640.58]  We pray for the council of this church,
[2640.94 --> 2644.50]  for the various leaders, and for the many, many volunteers.
[2645.60 --> 2647.48]  Give them the hope to which you call them,
[2647.86 --> 2649.94]  the richness of your glorious inheritance.
[2650.38 --> 2652.66]  And the great power for those who believe.
[2654.02 --> 2656.08]  We pray for our pastors and staff.
[2656.24 --> 2657.32]  Give them eyes to see.
[2658.00 --> 2661.56]  May the upcoming Roman series continue to challenge us
[2661.56 --> 2663.16]  and open the eyes of our hearts.
[2664.36 --> 2665.90]  Bless these faith heroes' messages,
[2666.64 --> 2669.18]  that we may not just see them, like Joseph,
[2669.18 --> 2670.84]  as larger than life,
[2671.22 --> 2673.54]  but an encouragement for our life.
[2674.76 --> 2675.84]  In your name we pray.
[2676.30 --> 2676.60]  Amen.
[2678.46 --> 2679.82]  Back to two kings.
[2681.34 --> 2683.24]  So the Arameans are threatening.
[2685.20 --> 2686.30]  And this is about,
[2686.66 --> 2690.70]  this starts with the servant of the prophet Elisha.
[2691.66 --> 2693.78]  When the servant of the man of God got up
[2693.78 --> 2695.30]  and went out early the next morning,
[2695.62 --> 2699.56]  an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city.
[2699.56 --> 2703.02]  Oh no, my lord, what shall we do?
[2703.02 --> 2704.32]  The servant asked.
[2706.32 --> 2708.78]  Don't be afraid, the prophet answered.
[2709.26 --> 2713.46]  Those who are with us are more than those who are with them.
[2713.46 --> 2715.48]  And Elisha prayed.
[2716.68 --> 2719.78]  Open his eyes, Lord, so that he may see.
[2719.78 --> 2723.68]  Then the Lord opened the servant's eyes,
[2723.76 --> 2728.94]  and he looked, and he saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire
[2728.94 --> 2731.16]  all around Elisha.
[2731.16 --> 2757.06]  As Rob indicated, we're going to continue our series looking at faith heroes,
[2757.06 --> 2761.02]  a list generated from Hebrews 11,
[2761.52 --> 2762.70]  but stories throughout the Bible.
[2762.80 --> 2765.16]  This morning, Amara is going to come up
[2765.16 --> 2769.50]  and read for us the text from Genesis 50.
[2770.16 --> 2772.96]  We're going to read verse 15 through 26.
[2773.48 --> 2777.00]  And so if you have a Bible either in your hands or on your phone,
[2777.10 --> 2778.98]  I encourage you to have that in front of you
[2778.98 --> 2782.96]  while Amara reads it and also for after.
[2782.96 --> 2788.44]  When Jesus' brothers saw that their father was dead,
[2788.66 --> 2789.08]  they said,
[2789.54 --> 2791.74]  What if Joseph holds a grudge against us
[2791.74 --> 2794.00]  and pays us back for all the wrongs we did to him?
[2794.34 --> 2796.24]  So they sent word to Joseph, saying,
[2796.52 --> 2798.80]  Your father left these instructions before he died.
[2799.20 --> 2800.96]  This is what you are to say to Joseph.
[2801.56 --> 2804.18]  I ask you to forgive your brothers
[2804.18 --> 2807.52]  the sins and the wrongs they committed in treating you so badly.
[2807.52 --> 2813.02]  Now please forgive the sins of the servant of the God of your father.
[2813.72 --> 2816.86]  When the message came to him, Joseph wept.
[2817.50 --> 2821.74]  His brothers then came and threw themselves down before him.
[2822.02 --> 2823.68]  We are your slaves, they said.
[2824.08 --> 2825.16]  But Joseph said,
[2825.46 --> 2826.30]  Do not be afraid.
[2826.70 --> 2828.30]  I am in the place of God.
[2828.54 --> 2829.94]  You intended to harm me,
[2830.02 --> 2831.68]  but God intended it for good
[2831.68 --> 2835.52]  to accomplish what is now being done.
[2835.52 --> 2838.14]  The saving of many lives.
[2838.62 --> 2840.02]  So then, don't be afraid.
[2840.52 --> 2843.26]  I will provide for you and your children.
[2843.94 --> 2847.04]  And he reassured them and spoke kindly to them.
[2848.80 --> 2853.38]  Joseph stayed in Egypt along with all of his father's family.
[2854.02 --> 2856.12]  He lives 110 years
[2856.12 --> 2859.24]  and saw the third generation of Ephraim's children,
[2859.52 --> 2862.38]  also the children of Machir, son of Manasseh,
[2862.70 --> 2864.62]  were placed at birth on Joseph's knee.
[2864.62 --> 2868.26]  Then Joseph said to his brothers,
[2868.58 --> 2869.50]  I am about to die,
[2869.80 --> 2871.62]  but God will surely come to your aid
[2871.62 --> 2875.06]  and take you up and out of this land
[2875.06 --> 2877.36]  to the land he promised on oath
[2877.36 --> 2879.62]  to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[2880.56 --> 2884.04]  And Joseph made the Israelites swear on oath
[2884.04 --> 2885.62]  and said,
[2886.50 --> 2888.08]  God will surely come to your aid
[2888.08 --> 2891.64]  and then you must carry my bones up from this place.
[2891.64 --> 2895.00]  So Joseph died at an age of 110
[2895.00 --> 2897.50]  and after they embalmed him,
[2897.92 --> 2899.96]  he was placed in a coffin in Egypt.
[2899.96 --> 2909.40]  Thanks, Amara.
[2909.40 --> 2909.50]  Thanks, Amara.
[2914.00 --> 2919.10]  As we have been looking at faith heroes
[2919.10 --> 2924.92]  and looking at characters and stories in the Bible
[2924.92 --> 2927.64]  that may be familiar to you,
[2927.64 --> 2929.50]  may not be familiar to you,
[2930.46 --> 2931.78]  we have been doing this
[2931.78 --> 2935.82]  as a way of trying to encourage each other
[2935.82 --> 2937.28]  and to be encouraged
[2937.28 --> 2940.84]  as we see God at work in the world
[2940.84 --> 2944.58]  through sometimes extraordinary people,
[2944.80 --> 2947.92]  but more often than not, ordinary people.
[2947.92 --> 2950.72]  And we've been holding those stories up
[2950.72 --> 2953.40]  alongside of some of our own stories
[2953.40 --> 2955.60]  and some of the stories of people
[2955.60 --> 2958.72]  that have impacted our lives of faith.
[2960.30 --> 2961.82]  To that end, at the very beginning
[2961.82 --> 2963.34]  of this series of this summer,
[2963.48 --> 2964.30]  and if you weren't here,
[2964.40 --> 2965.62]  you can be forgiven for this,
[2965.88 --> 2967.12]  but I did say,
[2967.36 --> 2971.30]  if you have seen God at work in your life
[2971.30 --> 2973.32]  or if you have a story
[2973.32 --> 2974.62]  that you would like to share,
[2974.94 --> 2976.06]  we would love to hear that.
[2976.06 --> 2978.60]  And, strangely enough,
[2979.02 --> 2980.10]  no one's called me,
[2981.00 --> 2981.94]  no one's emailed me,
[2982.00 --> 2982.86]  no one's reached out,
[2983.10 --> 2983.98]  and here's what I know.
[2985.06 --> 2986.68]  Some of y'all have seen God at work
[2986.68 --> 2987.62]  in this last week,
[2988.84 --> 2992.66]  let alone in these last number of weeks or months.
[2993.38 --> 2994.52]  And we want to celebrate that,
[2994.58 --> 2995.18]  we want to hear that.
[2995.26 --> 2999.64]  And so, if you would like to share with us something,
[2999.82 --> 3001.50]  please grab me after the service,
[3001.98 --> 3002.82]  touch base with me,
[3002.88 --> 3004.88]  and we will make it happen.
[3006.06 --> 3008.52]  Now, the story of Joseph
[3008.52 --> 3013.52]  is a beautiful and, I think anyway,
[3013.74 --> 3015.50]  compelling story
[3015.50 --> 3018.30]  of who God is
[3018.30 --> 3021.02]  and of one man's response
[3021.02 --> 3022.76]  and the impact that that has had
[3022.76 --> 3024.04]  on the people around him.
[3025.10 --> 3027.62]  The big idea for Joseph
[3027.62 --> 3028.94]  and for us this morning
[3028.94 --> 3032.70]  is to see how,
[3033.00 --> 3034.52]  in the Joseph story,
[3034.68 --> 3036.12]  we learn about
[3036.12 --> 3039.60]  the security of God's sovereignty
[3039.60 --> 3043.72]  and the power of God's providence
[3043.72 --> 3046.46]  and how those connect
[3046.46 --> 3048.30]  to your everyday life.
[3049.30 --> 3051.12]  So, what I hope you'll see this morning
[3051.12 --> 3052.28]  is that the Joseph story
[3052.28 --> 3054.94]  is about the security of God's sovereignty
[3054.94 --> 3057.74]  and the power of God's providence
[3057.74 --> 3059.84]  for your everyday life.
[3060.46 --> 3062.68]  Now, as I stand here this morning,
[3062.80 --> 3064.96]  I know that those might be
[3064.96 --> 3067.34]  sort of $5 theological words,
[3067.62 --> 3069.12]  sovereignty and providence,
[3069.62 --> 3071.54]  and probably not words you use
[3071.54 --> 3072.60]  in your ordinary life,
[3073.22 --> 3076.44]  unless you're a nerd like me.
[3076.44 --> 3079.84]  And so, I just want to take a minute
[3079.84 --> 3083.30]  and define our terms, right?
[3083.40 --> 3085.64]  What is God's sovereignty?
[3086.14 --> 3087.16]  What does that refer to?
[3087.82 --> 3088.92]  And then quickly also,
[3089.08 --> 3090.28]  what is providence?
[3091.18 --> 3093.44]  Now, simply put, sovereignty,
[3093.98 --> 3095.88]  God's sovereignty means
[3095.88 --> 3098.40]  God's right to rule.
[3099.74 --> 3101.46]  God's right to rule.
[3102.40 --> 3103.68]  So, when you read your Bible
[3103.68 --> 3107.06]  and you see the name God Almighty
[3107.06 --> 3108.74]  or the Lord Almighty,
[3109.12 --> 3110.50]  that's translating
[3110.50 --> 3114.12]  a Hebrew word pair named for God
[3114.12 --> 3115.86]  that is El in Hebrew,
[3116.00 --> 3117.04]  which is a word for God,
[3117.18 --> 3118.02]  and Shaddai.
[3118.84 --> 3120.04]  El Shaddai.
[3120.82 --> 3122.30]  Shaddai is the name
[3122.30 --> 3124.20]  by which God is primarily known
[3124.20 --> 3126.26]  before He gives His covenant name
[3126.26 --> 3127.64]  to His people, Yahweh.
[3128.62 --> 3130.70]  Shaddai is sometimes translated
[3130.70 --> 3133.60]  as sovereign or ruler.
[3135.32 --> 3136.68]  In what became
[3136.68 --> 3139.86]  the sort of first authorized translation
[3139.86 --> 3141.34]  of the Bible,
[3141.64 --> 3143.32]  which is the Latin Vulgate,
[3143.48 --> 3144.68]  which was written by Jerome
[3144.68 --> 3146.00]  in the fourth century,
[3146.42 --> 3147.36]  translated by Jerome
[3147.36 --> 3148.26]  in the fourth century,
[3149.22 --> 3151.00]  Shaddai is translated
[3151.00 --> 3152.68]  into the Latin word
[3152.68 --> 3154.08]  omnipotence,
[3155.08 --> 3156.72]  which you might hear in that,
[3156.82 --> 3158.80]  the English word omnipotence,
[3158.80 --> 3160.46]  which is the word
[3160.46 --> 3162.60]  that we use for all-powerful.
[3165.82 --> 3167.34]  There's a theologian
[3167.34 --> 3170.02]  that I really appreciate,
[3170.02 --> 3172.52]  and his work on this
[3172.52 --> 3173.88]  is really clear, I think.
[3174.14 --> 3175.36]  His name is Herman Bavinck.
[3175.42 --> 3176.02]  He's a Dutch theologian
[3176.62 --> 3178.26]  from the late 19th,
[3178.26 --> 3179.16]  early 20th century.
[3180.14 --> 3181.70]  He writes this,
[3181.70 --> 3184.96]  God is the creator
[3184.96 --> 3186.52]  and therefore owner,
[3186.96 --> 3187.58]  possessor,
[3187.72 --> 3189.90]  and Lord of all things.
[3191.08 --> 3191.80]  Apart from Him,
[3191.88 --> 3192.80]  there is no existence
[3192.80 --> 3193.58]  or ownership.
[3193.94 --> 3196.94]  He alone has absolute authority.
[3197.58 --> 3199.12]  Always and everywhere,
[3199.66 --> 3201.62]  His will decides.
[3204.00 --> 3205.14]  In short,
[3206.22 --> 3207.32]  God's sovereignty
[3207.32 --> 3209.34]  is His reign
[3209.34 --> 3210.88]  over all the world
[3210.88 --> 3212.86]  as creator king.
[3214.48 --> 3215.96]  And with eyes to see,
[3216.12 --> 3216.74]  you can see
[3216.74 --> 3218.22]  how this shows up
[3218.22 --> 3219.60]  in the story of Joseph
[3219.60 --> 3220.56]  over and over
[3220.56 --> 3221.40]  and over again.
[3222.56 --> 3222.76]  Right?
[3222.84 --> 3223.86]  Before anything
[3223.86 --> 3225.30]  truly bad
[3225.30 --> 3226.18]  befalls him,
[3226.26 --> 3228.30]  back in Genesis 37,
[3228.50 --> 3229.46]  where Joseph's story
[3229.46 --> 3230.44]  starts,
[3232.02 --> 3233.28]  Joseph has
[3233.28 --> 3234.38]  a dream
[3234.38 --> 3236.34]  that one day
[3236.34 --> 3237.14]  he will be
[3237.14 --> 3238.16]  a great ruler
[3238.16 --> 3239.48]  and all people
[3239.48 --> 3240.72]  will bow down
[3240.72 --> 3241.10]  to him.
[3242.74 --> 3244.16]  In the first dream,
[3244.44 --> 3245.70]  Joseph and his brothers
[3245.70 --> 3247.02]  are out in the field
[3247.02 --> 3248.26]  binding up sheaves
[3248.26 --> 3248.82]  of wheat.
[3250.12 --> 3250.26]  Right?
[3250.36 --> 3251.22]  Sheaves of grain.
[3251.90 --> 3253.08]  And then all of a sudden,
[3253.26 --> 3254.60]  Joseph's sheaf
[3254.60 --> 3255.72]  stands up
[3255.72 --> 3256.76]  in front of the brothers'
[3256.76 --> 3257.64]  sheaves
[3257.64 --> 3258.60]  and their sheaves
[3258.60 --> 3259.74]  start bowing down
[3259.74 --> 3260.18]  to him.
[3261.74 --> 3262.76]  Now you can imagine,
[3262.88 --> 3263.14]  Joseph,
[3263.36 --> 3264.08]  one of the younger
[3264.08 --> 3265.48]  of this family,
[3265.70 --> 3266.76]  and his brothers
[3266.76 --> 3267.72]  all bowing down
[3267.72 --> 3267.98]  to him,
[3268.04 --> 3268.76]  they don't take
[3268.76 --> 3269.42]  that well.
[3270.64 --> 3271.76]  He has another dream.
[3272.50 --> 3273.22]  This time,
[3273.62 --> 3274.82]  the sun and the moon
[3274.82 --> 3275.82]  and the stars
[3275.82 --> 3278.04]  are all bowing down
[3278.04 --> 3278.96]  to Joseph.
[3280.10 --> 3280.80]  Now this is usually
[3280.80 --> 3281.54]  interpreted to mean
[3281.54 --> 3283.12]  that Jacob and Rachel,
[3283.24 --> 3283.90]  his parents,
[3284.12 --> 3285.32]  and all of his brothers
[3285.32 --> 3287.20]  would bow to him
[3287.20 --> 3289.18]  at some point
[3289.18 --> 3291.08]  in their future.
[3291.40 --> 3292.66]  Joseph's dreams
[3292.66 --> 3294.10]  are a prediction
[3294.10 --> 3295.76]  of what is to come
[3295.76 --> 3296.80]  of the future
[3296.80 --> 3298.36]  and his dreams
[3298.36 --> 3299.36]  are only,
[3299.84 --> 3301.06]  his dreams
[3301.06 --> 3301.82]  as a prediction
[3301.82 --> 3302.68]  of the future
[3302.68 --> 3304.62]  is only possible
[3304.62 --> 3307.46]  if God is sovereign.
[3308.36 --> 3308.86]  Right?
[3308.92 --> 3309.58]  That the future
[3309.58 --> 3310.40]  is fixed
[3310.40 --> 3311.88]  in the hands of God
[3311.88 --> 3313.50]  is only possible
[3313.50 --> 3315.70]  if he is sovereign.
[3316.24 --> 3317.34]  And that gets
[3317.34 --> 3318.28]  his story started.
[3319.12 --> 3320.36]  And we don't exactly know
[3320.36 --> 3321.50]  what Joseph's attitude
[3321.50 --> 3322.60]  was like
[3322.60 --> 3323.46]  when he went through
[3323.46 --> 3324.88]  everything that happened
[3324.88 --> 3325.30]  to him.
[3325.94 --> 3327.08]  But we do know
[3327.08 --> 3329.18]  that in every circumstance,
[3329.46 --> 3330.32]  no matter what it was,
[3330.44 --> 3332.90]  he tries to be faithful
[3332.90 --> 3334.94]  and obedient to God
[3334.94 --> 3336.56]  and his will for living.
[3337.74 --> 3338.60]  And so his brothers
[3338.60 --> 3340.78]  don't like this arrogant
[3340.78 --> 3342.06]  young man in their midst
[3342.06 --> 3343.12]  and so they plot
[3343.12 --> 3343.88]  to kill him.
[3344.36 --> 3345.30]  Instead of killing him,
[3345.38 --> 3346.38]  they beat him badly
[3346.38 --> 3347.22]  and they throw him
[3347.22 --> 3347.74]  in a well.
[3347.90 --> 3349.28]  They sell him into slavery
[3349.28 --> 3350.52]  to some Midianites
[3350.52 --> 3351.48]  or some Ishmaelites
[3351.48 --> 3352.50]  and he ends up
[3352.50 --> 3354.10]  in Egypt
[3354.10 --> 3355.20]  where he's sold
[3355.20 --> 3356.06]  into the house
[3356.06 --> 3357.10]  of Potiphar
[3357.10 --> 3359.00]  who's an Egyptian official.
[3360.52 --> 3361.42]  Potiphar's wife
[3361.42 --> 3364.76]  accuses Joseph of rape
[3364.76 --> 3365.88]  after she tries
[3365.88 --> 3367.02]  to sleep with him.
[3367.96 --> 3368.84]  And Joseph says
[3368.84 --> 3370.48]  in Genesis 39 verse 9,
[3370.98 --> 3371.94]  how could I do
[3371.94 --> 3373.16]  such a wicked thing
[3373.16 --> 3375.04]  and sin against God?
[3376.30 --> 3377.02]  Joseph is thrown
[3377.02 --> 3377.54]  into prison.
[3378.54 --> 3379.52]  And while in prison,
[3379.52 --> 3381.32]  more dreams occur.
[3381.52 --> 3383.42]  Pharaoh has a couple dreams
[3383.42 --> 3384.58]  and he asks Joseph
[3384.58 --> 3386.62]  to interpret those dreams.
[3387.66 --> 3388.70]  And Joseph says
[3388.70 --> 3389.90]  in Genesis 41,
[3390.26 --> 3391.42]  I cannot do it,
[3391.62 --> 3393.48]  but God will give Pharaoh
[3393.48 --> 3394.88]  the answer he desires.
[3397.36 --> 3400.02]  Joseph speaks this answer
[3400.02 --> 3400.84]  given from God
[3400.84 --> 3401.84]  who is sovereign
[3401.84 --> 3403.72]  and Pharaoh rewards him
[3403.72 --> 3405.06]  with a privileged place
[3405.06 --> 3406.46]  and Joseph eventually
[3406.46 --> 3407.94]  moves up through the ranks
[3407.94 --> 3408.52]  and he becomes
[3408.52 --> 3410.30]  the vizier in Egypt
[3410.30 --> 3411.82]  which is second in command
[3411.82 --> 3413.50]  only to Pharaoh.
[3414.88 --> 3416.70]  And he ends up
[3416.70 --> 3417.50]  taking a wife
[3417.50 --> 3418.44]  and having a family.
[3419.12 --> 3420.24]  And in Genesis 41,
[3420.88 --> 3421.50]  we read,
[3421.58 --> 3423.34]  Joseph named his firstborn
[3423.34 --> 3424.38]  Manasseh
[3424.38 --> 3425.02]  and said,
[3425.50 --> 3426.58]  it is because God
[3426.58 --> 3427.80]  has made me forget
[3427.80 --> 3428.58]  all my trouble.
[3429.24 --> 3430.16]  And the second son,
[3430.28 --> 3431.20]  he named Ephraim
[3431.20 --> 3431.86]  and said,
[3431.86 --> 3433.22]  it is because God
[3433.22 --> 3434.40]  has made me fruitful
[3434.40 --> 3435.24]  in the land
[3435.24 --> 3436.08]  of my suffering.
[3437.76 --> 3438.66]  And then Joseph's story
[3438.66 --> 3439.36]  continues because
[3439.36 --> 3440.52]  this famine that he predicted
[3440.52 --> 3441.32]  does come
[3441.32 --> 3442.74]  and his brothers now come
[3442.74 --> 3444.90]  from the land of Canaan
[3444.90 --> 3445.86]  where they were previously
[3445.86 --> 3446.72]  and they come
[3446.72 --> 3448.44]  to receive the grain stores
[3448.44 --> 3449.04]  that Joseph
[3449.04 --> 3450.24]  had helped preserve
[3450.24 --> 3451.60]  but they're worried
[3451.60 --> 3452.70]  that he's going to extract
[3452.70 --> 3454.42]  his revenge on them
[3454.42 --> 3455.54]  and in the text
[3455.54 --> 3456.36]  that we read
[3456.36 --> 3457.36]  in Genesis 50,
[3457.86 --> 3458.48]  Joseph says,
[3458.82 --> 3459.78]  don't be afraid.
[3459.78 --> 3462.46]  Am I in the place of God?
[3462.98 --> 3464.20]  You intended to harm me
[3464.20 --> 3465.76]  but God intended it for good
[3465.76 --> 3466.62]  to accomplish
[3466.62 --> 3467.78]  what is now being done,
[3467.88 --> 3469.96]  the saving of many lives.
[3470.04 --> 3471.22]  So don't be afraid.
[3471.80 --> 3473.24]  I will provide for you
[3473.24 --> 3474.66]  and your children.
[3476.64 --> 3478.46]  The rule of God
[3478.46 --> 3481.48]  and his standing over history
[3481.48 --> 3484.60]  and then Joseph's submission to it
[3484.60 --> 3486.82]  and security within it
[3486.82 --> 3489.76]  is all over the faith story
[3489.76 --> 3490.82]  of Joseph.
[3491.92 --> 3492.94]  But so too
[3492.94 --> 3494.34]  is the power
[3494.34 --> 3496.02]  of God's providence.
[3496.98 --> 3497.82]  So in the same vein,
[3497.98 --> 3499.92]  what is providence?
[3501.58 --> 3502.96]  If sovereignty
[3502.96 --> 3505.90]  is God's right to rule,
[3506.62 --> 3509.50]  providence is God's active ruling
[3509.50 --> 3510.56]  in the world.
[3510.86 --> 3511.98]  It's his actions
[3511.98 --> 3514.60]  that come out of that ruling.
[3514.60 --> 3517.02]  And so the very act
[3517.02 --> 3517.60]  of creation
[3518.14 --> 3519.22]  in the very beginning
[3519.22 --> 3520.02]  when God said,
[3520.22 --> 3520.84]  let there be
[3520.84 --> 3522.44]  and there was,
[3522.50 --> 3523.24]  that act
[3523.24 --> 3525.42]  is part of God's providence.
[3526.36 --> 3527.08]  In fact,
[3527.20 --> 3527.68]  in the old
[3527.68 --> 3528.60]  Westminster Divines,
[3529.26 --> 3530.88]  old theological traditions,
[3531.38 --> 3531.88]  the doctrine
[3531.88 --> 3532.60]  of God's providence
[3533.24 --> 3534.56]  was sometimes called
[3534.56 --> 3535.18]  the doctrine
[3535.18 --> 3537.10]  of continuing creation.
[3538.66 --> 3539.14]  Providence
[3539.14 --> 3540.10]  is God's
[3540.10 --> 3541.64]  continued involvement
[3541.64 --> 3542.86]  in the world
[3542.86 --> 3543.86]  for his glory
[3543.86 --> 3544.66]  and for the good
[3544.66 --> 3545.80]  of all that he has made.
[3546.82 --> 3547.42]  And so we read
[3547.42 --> 3548.38]  in Colossians 1,
[3549.20 --> 3549.94]  all things
[3549.94 --> 3550.68]  have been created
[3550.68 --> 3551.36]  through him
[3551.36 --> 3552.26]  and for him.
[3552.36 --> 3554.00]  He is before all things
[3554.00 --> 3555.42]  and in him
[3555.42 --> 3556.72]  all things
[3556.72 --> 3557.30]  hold
[3557.30 --> 3558.30]  together.
[3559.34 --> 3560.30]  And again,
[3560.54 --> 3561.54]  very clearly,
[3562.00 --> 3563.10]  God's providence
[3563.10 --> 3564.22]  is all over
[3564.22 --> 3564.94]  the story
[3564.94 --> 3565.50]  of Joseph.
[3566.80 --> 3567.70]  God's providence
[3567.70 --> 3568.32]  is all over
[3568.32 --> 3568.78]  the story
[3568.78 --> 3569.68]  of the entire drama
[3569.68 --> 3570.32]  of Scripture.
[3570.32 --> 3571.54]  any time
[3571.54 --> 3572.32]  God acts
[3572.32 --> 3573.08]  in the world
[3573.08 --> 3573.76]  explicitly
[3573.76 --> 3575.06]  or behind the scenes,
[3575.16 --> 3576.12]  he is acting
[3576.12 --> 3577.26]  providentially.
[3578.64 --> 3579.10]  And so again,
[3579.20 --> 3579.70]  in the story
[3579.70 --> 3580.20]  of Joseph,
[3580.58 --> 3581.34]  in addition to everything
[3581.34 --> 3582.24]  we've already just covered,
[3582.72 --> 3583.98]  in Genesis 39,
[3584.42 --> 3584.84]  you read,
[3585.00 --> 3585.34]  the Lord
[3585.34 --> 3586.80]  was with him.
[3587.76 --> 3587.94]  Right?
[3587.96 --> 3588.78]  He had the promises
[3588.78 --> 3589.92]  of God.
[3590.02 --> 3591.50]  He had the providence
[3591.50 --> 3592.26]  of God
[3592.26 --> 3593.02]  and the power
[3593.02 --> 3593.66]  of God
[3593.66 --> 3594.84]  to rest in.
[3595.68 --> 3596.52]  God was always
[3596.52 --> 3597.00]  with him.
[3597.06 --> 3597.78]  We continue
[3597.78 --> 3598.14]  to read
[3598.14 --> 3598.88]  in Genesis 39.
[3599.02 --> 3599.42]  The Lord
[3599.42 --> 3600.18]  was with Joseph
[3600.18 --> 3601.02]  and gave him
[3601.02 --> 3601.70]  success
[3601.70 --> 3602.74]  in whatever
[3602.74 --> 3603.64]  he did.
[3604.64 --> 3605.28]  And again,
[3605.40 --> 3606.34]  from what we read
[3606.34 --> 3607.00]  or from what Amara
[3607.00 --> 3607.58]  read for us,
[3607.84 --> 3608.98]  God intended it
[3608.98 --> 3609.64]  for good
[3609.64 --> 3610.66]  to accomplish
[3610.66 --> 3611.40]  what is now
[3611.40 --> 3612.02]  being done,
[3612.12 --> 3612.64]  the saving
[3612.64 --> 3614.34]  of many lives.
[3614.78 --> 3614.90]  Right?
[3614.92 --> 3615.40]  That phrase,
[3615.50 --> 3616.22]  to accomplish,
[3616.50 --> 3617.60]  is God-active
[3617.60 --> 3618.48]  language.
[3618.48 --> 3619.26]  That's God
[3619.26 --> 3619.90]  at work
[3619.90 --> 3621.00]  in the world.
[3622.92 --> 3623.06]  Now,
[3623.06 --> 3626.76]  to be sure,
[3627.72 --> 3629.12]  this isn't just
[3629.12 --> 3629.94]  an academic
[3629.94 --> 3631.50]  or a semantic
[3631.50 --> 3632.98]  distinction.
[3634.54 --> 3635.32]  Right?
[3635.40 --> 3636.30]  The security
[3636.30 --> 3637.56]  of God's sovereignty
[3637.56 --> 3638.54]  and the power
[3638.54 --> 3639.88]  of God's providence
[3639.88 --> 3640.60]  impacts
[3640.60 --> 3642.34]  your everyday life
[3642.34 --> 3644.74]  in every way.
[3646.40 --> 3647.22]  Providence
[3647.22 --> 3647.92]  impacts
[3647.92 --> 3649.14]  your life
[3649.14 --> 3651.12]  every day.
[3651.12 --> 3652.48]  Let me give you
[3652.48 --> 3653.36]  a few examples
[3653.36 --> 3654.42]  straight from
[3654.42 --> 3654.76]  the story
[3654.76 --> 3655.18]  of Joseph
[3655.18 --> 3656.14]  and really
[3656.14 --> 3656.64]  even just
[3656.64 --> 3657.20]  from the part
[3657.20 --> 3658.34]  that we read
[3658.34 --> 3659.22]  this morning.
[3659.96 --> 3660.18]  Now,
[3660.20 --> 3660.74]  these examples
[3660.74 --> 3661.54]  are informed
[3661.54 --> 3662.62]  in part
[3662.62 --> 3663.60]  from Hebrews
[3663.60 --> 3664.24]  11,
[3664.46 --> 3664.88]  22,
[3665.32 --> 3666.60]  which lists
[3666.60 --> 3667.58]  Joseph
[3667.58 --> 3668.48]  as one
[3668.48 --> 3669.16]  of our
[3669.16 --> 3670.14]  faith heroes,
[3670.26 --> 3670.62]  as one of
[3670.62 --> 3671.52]  those testimonies
[3671.52 --> 3672.48]  that we look
[3672.48 --> 3673.02]  back to.
[3674.10 --> 3674.80]  Hebrews 11,
[3674.90 --> 3675.74]  22 says
[3675.74 --> 3676.88]  of Joseph,
[3677.84 --> 3678.58]  by faith,
[3678.92 --> 3679.24]  Joseph,
[3679.24 --> 3680.40]  when his
[3680.40 --> 3681.04]  end was
[3681.04 --> 3681.38]  near,
[3681.90 --> 3682.64]  spoke about
[3682.64 --> 3683.26]  the exodus
[3683.26 --> 3684.02]  of the Israelites
[3684.02 --> 3684.80]  from Egypt
[3684.80 --> 3685.90]  and gave instructions
[3685.90 --> 3687.00]  concerning the
[3687.00 --> 3689.56]  burial of his bones.
[3691.30 --> 3691.48]  Now,
[3691.48 --> 3691.98]  the line
[3691.98 --> 3692.76]  that Hebrews,
[3693.02 --> 3693.48]  the author
[3693.48 --> 3694.04]  of Hebrews,
[3694.16 --> 3695.08]  is focusing on
[3695.08 --> 3695.92]  and reflecting on
[3695.92 --> 3696.94]  is verse 24
[3696.94 --> 3697.98]  of what Amara
[3697.98 --> 3699.16]  read for us,
[3699.24 --> 3700.14]  where we read,
[3700.26 --> 3701.06]  God will surely
[3701.06 --> 3702.10]  come to your aid
[3702.10 --> 3703.10]  and take you up
[3703.10 --> 3704.22]  out of this land
[3704.22 --> 3705.00]  to the land
[3705.00 --> 3705.76]  he promised
[3705.76 --> 3706.38]  on oath
[3706.38 --> 3706.94]  to Abraham,
[3707.60 --> 3708.00]  Isaac,
[3708.40 --> 3708.94]  and Jacob.
[3710.20 --> 3710.62]  Now,
[3710.66 --> 3711.16]  notice,
[3711.30 --> 3711.54]  right,
[3711.62 --> 3712.48]  in Joseph's
[3712.48 --> 3712.98]  mind,
[3713.94 --> 3714.54]  the hoped
[3714.54 --> 3715.74]  for exodus
[3715.74 --> 3717.66]  is a sure
[3717.66 --> 3718.62]  thing,
[3719.50 --> 3719.64]  right?
[3719.70 --> 3720.64]  God will surely
[3720.64 --> 3722.24]  come to your aid.
[3722.64 --> 3723.64]  And it's a sure
[3723.64 --> 3724.76]  thing to Joseph
[3724.76 --> 3726.36]  because he has seen
[3726.36 --> 3727.64]  God's providential
[3727.64 --> 3728.80]  action in the world
[3728.80 --> 3731.58]  that's the operation
[3731.58 --> 3732.66]  of God's sovereign
[3732.66 --> 3733.02]  rule.
[3734.74 --> 3734.94]  Now,
[3735.06 --> 3735.82]  fast forward,
[3736.34 --> 3736.64]  right,
[3736.64 --> 3738.20]  the promise
[3738.20 --> 3739.52]  for us
[3739.52 --> 3740.64]  is seen
[3740.64 --> 3741.68]  and reiterated
[3741.68 --> 3742.48]  and made real
[3742.48 --> 3743.30]  again in the
[3743.30 --> 3744.32]  resurrection
[3744.32 --> 3745.68]  of Jesus,
[3745.88 --> 3746.54]  but then also
[3746.54 --> 3747.50]  in the return
[3747.50 --> 3748.54]  of Jesus,
[3749.14 --> 3749.50]  right,
[3749.54 --> 3750.28]  which makes
[3750.28 --> 3751.04]  for us
[3751.04 --> 3752.08]  all the earth
[3752.08 --> 3753.22]  a new promised
[3753.22 --> 3754.06]  land.
[3755.56 --> 3756.40]  And so,
[3757.12 --> 3758.56]  for your life,
[3759.22 --> 3759.62]  notice
[3759.62 --> 3760.76]  these,
[3761.10 --> 3762.60]  at least these,
[3762.76 --> 3763.04]  anyway,
[3763.04 --> 3763.90]  two things.
[3763.90 --> 3766.06]  one,
[3767.36 --> 3768.22]  Joseph shows
[3768.22 --> 3768.70]  us
[3768.70 --> 3769.54]  that
[3769.54 --> 3771.16]  the treasures
[3771.16 --> 3772.24]  of this
[3772.24 --> 3773.12]  life
[3773.12 --> 3774.68]  don't compare
[3774.68 --> 3775.82]  to the sure
[3775.82 --> 3776.80]  promises
[3776.80 --> 3778.14]  of God
[3778.14 --> 3778.98]  for the world
[3778.98 --> 3779.40]  to come.
[3780.98 --> 3781.20]  Right,
[3781.24 --> 3781.94]  even though Joseph
[3781.94 --> 3782.62]  was a ruler
[3782.62 --> 3783.52]  in Egypt,
[3783.90 --> 3784.50]  even though he had
[3784.50 --> 3785.30]  all the wealth
[3785.30 --> 3786.04]  and the privilege
[3786.04 --> 3787.14]  and the power
[3787.14 --> 3787.98]  of his position
[3787.98 --> 3789.06]  as a
[3789.06 --> 3789.64]  vizier
[3789.64 --> 3790.68]  and a pharaoh,
[3790.68 --> 3791.82]  his heart
[3791.82 --> 3792.84]  is for
[3792.84 --> 3793.80]  the sure
[3793.80 --> 3794.86]  promises
[3794.86 --> 3796.10]  of God.
[3797.04 --> 3797.96]  And all the wealth
[3797.96 --> 3798.70]  of Egypt
[3798.70 --> 3799.90]  doesn't compare.
[3801.14 --> 3801.88]  The same is true
[3801.88 --> 3802.40]  for us.
[3803.06 --> 3803.82]  All the wealth
[3803.82 --> 3804.44]  of this world,
[3804.54 --> 3805.24]  all the privilege
[3805.24 --> 3805.78]  that you might
[3805.78 --> 3806.66]  experience here
[3806.66 --> 3807.98]  does not compare
[3807.98 --> 3808.82]  to the glory
[3808.82 --> 3810.04]  of God's
[3810.04 --> 3810.58]  kingdom.
[3811.84 --> 3812.26]  And then,
[3812.32 --> 3812.76]  likewise,
[3813.24 --> 3814.28]  all the suffering,
[3814.48 --> 3815.10]  all the trials,
[3815.26 --> 3816.02]  all the tribulations
[3816.02 --> 3817.02]  that you might face
[3817.02 --> 3817.72]  in this world
[3817.72 --> 3818.68]  are not worth
[3818.68 --> 3819.64]  comparing to the
[3819.64 --> 3820.28]  future glory
[3820.28 --> 3821.00]  that will be
[3821.00 --> 3822.14]  revealed in us
[3822.14 --> 3823.38]  and to us.
[3824.76 --> 3825.34]  And yet,
[3826.04 --> 3827.30]  how quickly
[3827.30 --> 3828.08]  do we
[3828.08 --> 3830.18]  bind our hearts
[3830.18 --> 3831.22]  and our sense
[3831.22 --> 3831.84]  of joy
[3831.84 --> 3833.02]  and our ideas
[3833.02 --> 3833.92]  of fulfillment
[3833.92 --> 3834.68]  and purpose
[3834.68 --> 3835.70]  to the things
[3835.70 --> 3836.60]  of this world
[3836.60 --> 3838.56]  rather than
[3838.56 --> 3840.62]  to our sovereign God?
[3842.32 --> 3843.40]  Joseph wants you
[3843.40 --> 3843.86]  to see
[3843.86 --> 3845.56]  that Jesus Christ
[3845.56 --> 3846.50]  is a greater
[3846.50 --> 3847.00]  treasure
[3847.00 --> 3848.08]  than anything
[3848.08 --> 3849.02]  you will find
[3849.02 --> 3850.16]  in this world.
[3850.28 --> 3853.16]  second thing
[3853.16 --> 3853.98]  to see here
[3853.98 --> 3856.40]  is that
[3856.40 --> 3858.30]  even with
[3858.30 --> 3859.24]  his death
[3859.24 --> 3860.18]  looming,
[3861.86 --> 3862.18]  Joseph
[3862.18 --> 3863.38]  isn't afraid,
[3864.08 --> 3864.94]  but he trusted
[3864.94 --> 3866.02]  in the promises
[3866.02 --> 3866.66]  of God
[3866.66 --> 3868.00]  for the future.
[3868.76 --> 3869.60]  And so,
[3869.76 --> 3870.34]  with that,
[3870.50 --> 3871.74]  he had a sense
[3871.74 --> 3872.62]  of comfort
[3872.62 --> 3873.72]  and peace
[3873.72 --> 3875.16]  in the present.
[3875.16 --> 3876.16]  God
[3876.16 --> 3876.98]  and just
[3876.98 --> 3877.56]  like the last,
[3877.66 --> 3877.76]  right,
[3877.84 --> 3878.40]  fast forward,
[3878.56 --> 3879.44]  the same is true
[3879.44 --> 3880.64]  for us today.
[3881.02 --> 3881.64]  Christians,
[3881.88 --> 3882.02]  right,
[3882.06 --> 3883.48]  we aren't afraid
[3883.48 --> 3884.38]  of death
[3884.38 --> 3885.44]  because of
[3885.44 --> 3885.82]  Jesus'
[3886.36 --> 3886.90]  resurrection
[3886.90 --> 3887.54]  and Jesus'
[3887.76 --> 3888.14]  resurrection
[3888.14 --> 3889.46]  is a guarantee
[3889.46 --> 3891.50]  of our resurrection
[3891.50 --> 3892.40]  and Jesus'
[3892.62 --> 3893.02]  resurrection
[3893.02 --> 3893.74]  and ascension
[3893.74 --> 3894.48]  is a promise
[3894.48 --> 3895.90]  that one day
[3895.90 --> 3897.10]  he will return
[3897.10 --> 3898.12]  in power.
[3898.12 --> 3898.24]  forever.
[3899.70 --> 3900.10]  And so,
[3900.90 --> 3901.32]  yes,
[3901.42 --> 3901.78]  we don't
[3901.78 --> 3902.98]  rush towards
[3902.98 --> 3903.34]  death,
[3903.44 --> 3903.76]  we don't
[3903.76 --> 3904.26]  hasten
[3904.26 --> 3905.22]  its coming,
[3905.56 --> 3905.70]  right,
[3905.78 --> 3906.24]  and in fact,
[3906.34 --> 3906.88]  we don't hasten
[3906.88 --> 3907.34]  its coming
[3907.34 --> 3907.88]  for the very
[3907.88 --> 3908.76]  same reason
[3908.76 --> 3909.96]  that resurrection
[3909.96 --> 3911.28]  is so compelling
[3911.28 --> 3912.00]  in the face
[3912.00 --> 3912.48]  of death.
[3913.76 --> 3913.92]  Right,
[3914.00 --> 3914.68]  resurrection is
[3914.68 --> 3915.00]  compelling
[3915.00 --> 3915.56]  in the face
[3915.56 --> 3915.94]  of death
[3915.94 --> 3917.02]  because humans
[3917.02 --> 3918.28]  are meant
[3918.28 --> 3919.02]  to be
[3919.02 --> 3919.78]  embodied
[3919.78 --> 3920.64]  souls.
[3922.70 --> 3923.22]  Right,
[3923.28 --> 3924.36]  you are meant
[3924.36 --> 3925.06]  to be
[3925.06 --> 3925.98]  a soul
[3925.98 --> 3927.18]  with a body.
[3928.12 --> 3928.94]  A soul
[3928.94 --> 3930.18]  without a body,
[3930.40 --> 3931.52]  even in heaven,
[3932.22 --> 3933.28]  isn't as good
[3933.28 --> 3933.98]  or right
[3933.98 --> 3934.90]  or how it's
[3934.90 --> 3935.96]  supposed to be
[3935.96 --> 3937.06]  as a soul
[3937.06 --> 3937.78]  embodied
[3937.78 --> 3939.10]  in the flesh.
[3940.28 --> 3941.40]  To make that point,
[3941.50 --> 3942.08]  that's why
[3942.08 --> 3942.56]  Jesus
[3942.56 --> 3944.00]  now
[3944.00 --> 3945.20]  still has
[3945.20 --> 3946.28]  a flesh
[3946.28 --> 3947.14]  body,
[3947.66 --> 3947.86]  right,
[3947.94 --> 3949.14]  raised and incorruptible,
[3949.26 --> 3949.64]  absolutely,
[3949.92 --> 3950.16]  yes,
[3950.20 --> 3951.08]  but he is still
[3951.08 --> 3952.00]  incarnated,
[3952.10 --> 3952.54]  he's still
[3952.54 --> 3953.30]  enfleshed
[3953.30 --> 3954.22]  because he
[3954.22 --> 3955.18]  is truly
[3955.18 --> 3955.70]  human,
[3955.84 --> 3956.44]  he is still
[3956.44 --> 3957.24]  truly human
[3957.24 --> 3958.18]  and to be
[3958.18 --> 3958.98]  fully human,
[3959.16 --> 3959.86]  fully alive
[3959.86 --> 3961.16]  is to be
[3961.16 --> 3962.62]  embodied.
[3963.90 --> 3964.80]  The created
[3964.80 --> 3965.36]  body
[3965.36 --> 3966.16]  matters
[3966.16 --> 3967.70]  and so life
[3967.70 --> 3968.38]  in a created
[3968.38 --> 3968.84]  body
[3968.84 --> 3969.60]  matters
[3969.60 --> 3972.06]  and yet,
[3972.66 --> 3973.66]  even still,
[3974.42 --> 3975.32]  though we may
[3975.32 --> 3975.72]  die,
[3976.26 --> 3977.20]  we do not
[3977.20 --> 3977.64]  mourn
[3977.64 --> 3978.36]  as those
[3978.36 --> 3979.40]  without hope
[3979.40 --> 3980.42]  because we know
[3980.42 --> 3980.96]  that those
[3980.96 --> 3981.50]  who die
[3981.50 --> 3982.22]  in the Lord
[3982.22 --> 3982.74]  will be
[3982.74 --> 3983.94]  raised up
[3983.94 --> 3984.54]  when he
[3984.54 --> 3985.54]  returns.
[3987.38 --> 3987.92]  Heaven
[3987.92 --> 3988.52]  is good,
[3989.64 --> 3990.04]  but
[3990.04 --> 3990.62]  resurrection
[3990.62 --> 3992.50]  even better,
[3993.78 --> 3993.90]  right,
[3993.96 --> 3994.26]  to be
[3994.26 --> 3994.80]  embodied
[3994.80 --> 3996.32]  is better.
[3998.00 --> 3998.64]  In the
[3998.64 --> 3999.24]  famous chapter
[3999.24 --> 4000.06]  on resurrection
[4000.06 --> 4001.46]  in 1 Corinthians
[4001.46 --> 4001.96]  15,
[4002.12 --> 4002.64]  Paul says,
[4002.78 --> 4002.96]  where,
[4003.12 --> 4003.46]  oh death,
[4003.52 --> 4004.14]  is your victory,
[4004.28 --> 4004.50]  where,
[4004.62 --> 4004.92]  oh death,
[4004.96 --> 4005.56]  is your sting?
[4005.88 --> 4006.50]  The sting
[4006.50 --> 4007.00]  of death
[4007.00 --> 4007.54]  is sin
[4007.54 --> 4008.20]  and the power
[4008.20 --> 4008.62]  of sin
[4008.62 --> 4009.28]  is the law,
[4009.38 --> 4009.94]  but thanks
[4009.94 --> 4011.14]  be to God,
[4011.14 --> 4012.02]  he gives
[4012.02 --> 4012.96]  us victory
[4012.96 --> 4014.24]  through our
[4014.24 --> 4015.40]  Lord Jesus
[4015.40 --> 4016.30]  Christ.
[4018.58 --> 4019.34]  One of the
[4019.34 --> 4020.30]  most powerful
[4020.30 --> 4021.36]  testimonies
[4021.36 --> 4022.04]  of faith
[4022.04 --> 4023.02]  that you can
[4023.02 --> 4023.72]  witness in your
[4023.72 --> 4024.06]  life,
[4024.16 --> 4024.84]  that I have
[4024.84 --> 4025.58]  witnessed in my
[4025.58 --> 4025.84]  own,
[4026.48 --> 4027.28]  is when a
[4027.28 --> 4028.86]  person dies
[4028.86 --> 4030.12]  in the security
[4030.12 --> 4031.04]  of God's
[4031.04 --> 4031.46]  sovereignty
[4031.46 --> 4033.08]  and the power
[4033.08 --> 4033.94]  of God's
[4033.94 --> 4034.48]  providence.
[4034.48 --> 4035.48]  God's
[4035.48 --> 4036.48]  God's
[4036.48 --> 4037.40]  God's
[4037.40 --> 4038.52]  God's
[4038.52 --> 4038.60]  Now,
[4039.08 --> 4041.04]  as we dig
[4041.04 --> 4041.62]  into these
[4041.62 --> 4042.92]  ideas,
[4044.06 --> 4046.24]  I can anticipate
[4046.24 --> 4047.10]  a question
[4047.10 --> 4047.80]  from some
[4047.80 --> 4048.18]  of you,
[4048.64 --> 4048.78]  right,
[4048.82 --> 4049.62]  because sometimes
[4049.62 --> 4050.74]  when we talk
[4050.74 --> 4051.44]  about God's
[4051.44 --> 4051.82]  sovereignty,
[4052.08 --> 4052.68]  sometimes when we
[4052.68 --> 4053.46]  talk about God's
[4053.46 --> 4053.98]  providence,
[4054.28 --> 4054.80]  and this is
[4054.80 --> 4056.18]  especially offered
[4056.18 --> 4056.80]  up as a
[4056.80 --> 4057.88]  criticism of
[4057.88 --> 4058.62]  reformed
[4058.62 --> 4058.98]  Christians,
[4059.20 --> 4060.16]  which we are
[4060.16 --> 4060.78]  or I am,
[4061.36 --> 4062.62]  sometimes people
[4062.62 --> 4063.12]  think,
[4063.12 --> 4064.56]  well,
[4064.60 --> 4065.08]  if God's
[4065.08 --> 4065.50]  going to do
[4065.50 --> 4065.76]  it,
[4066.24 --> 4067.08]  why do I
[4067.08 --> 4067.50]  have to?
[4069.02 --> 4069.58]  I once
[4069.58 --> 4070.12]  worked with a
[4070.12 --> 4071.32]  person who
[4071.32 --> 4071.86]  would say,
[4072.06 --> 4073.10]  if it's God's
[4073.10 --> 4073.42]  will,
[4073.68 --> 4074.56]  it will happen.
[4075.08 --> 4075.78]  We don't have
[4075.78 --> 4076.42]  to do anything.
[4076.94 --> 4077.46]  We don't have
[4077.46 --> 4077.86]  to make a
[4077.86 --> 4078.20]  decision.
[4080.32 --> 4080.84]  But,
[4081.08 --> 4082.52]  that doesn't
[4082.52 --> 4083.24]  match with
[4083.24 --> 4084.04]  what the
[4084.04 --> 4085.00]  Bible teaches
[4085.00 --> 4085.68]  on this,
[4085.76 --> 4085.92]  right?
[4085.94 --> 4086.30]  The Bible
[4086.30 --> 4087.56]  commands us
[4087.56 --> 4089.08]  not to be
[4089.08 --> 4089.56]  idle,
[4089.76 --> 4090.38]  but to work
[4090.38 --> 4090.92]  diligently.
[4091.70 --> 4092.34]  That's 2
[4092.34 --> 4093.00]  Thessalonians
[4093.00 --> 4093.30]  3.
[4094.58 --> 4095.38]  The Bible
[4095.38 --> 4096.26]  reminds us
[4096.26 --> 4097.00]  that salvation
[4097.00 --> 4098.16]  from sin
[4098.16 --> 4099.42]  is salvation
[4099.42 --> 4100.66]  to good
[4100.66 --> 4101.10]  works.
[4101.90 --> 4102.28]  Ephesians
[4102.28 --> 4102.76]  2.10
[4102.76 --> 4103.08]  says,
[4103.52 --> 4104.08]  for we are
[4104.08 --> 4104.40]  God's
[4104.40 --> 4104.94]  handiwork
[4104.94 --> 4105.80]  created in
[4105.80 --> 4106.44]  Christ Jesus
[4106.44 --> 4107.24]  to do
[4107.24 --> 4108.48]  good works.
[4109.06 --> 4109.56]  Again,
[4109.64 --> 4109.96]  the letter
[4109.96 --> 4110.48]  to Hebrews
[4110.48 --> 4110.88]  says,
[4111.48 --> 4112.04]  make every
[4112.04 --> 4112.86]  effort to
[4112.86 --> 4113.66]  live in
[4113.66 --> 4114.16]  peace with
[4114.16 --> 4114.90]  everyone and
[4114.90 --> 4115.60]  to be
[4115.60 --> 4116.36]  holy.
[4117.28 --> 4117.62]  Without
[4117.62 --> 4118.10]  holiness,
[4118.32 --> 4118.68]  no one
[4118.68 --> 4119.10]  will see
[4119.10 --> 4119.84]  the Lord.
[4119.92 --> 4120.10]  And so,
[4120.16 --> 4120.38]  hear that,
[4120.44 --> 4120.96]  make every
[4120.96 --> 4121.36]  effort,
[4121.36 --> 4122.78]  and then
[4122.78 --> 4123.52]  be holy.
[4124.92 --> 4125.60]  Make every
[4125.60 --> 4125.92]  effort,
[4126.10 --> 4126.52]  do good
[4126.52 --> 4126.82]  works,
[4126.94 --> 4127.42]  don't be
[4127.42 --> 4127.80]  idle.
[4128.16 --> 4128.62]  All of
[4128.62 --> 4129.20]  these New
[4129.20 --> 4129.56]  Testament
[4129.56 --> 4130.30]  commands are
[4130.30 --> 4130.58]  given,
[4130.94 --> 4131.36]  and they
[4131.36 --> 4132.02]  sure don't
[4132.02 --> 4132.74]  sound like
[4132.74 --> 4133.78]  we can't
[4133.78 --> 4134.54]  say we
[4134.54 --> 4134.78]  don't have
[4134.78 --> 4134.98]  to do
[4134.98 --> 4135.30]  anything.
[4137.20 --> 4137.30]  Right?
[4137.48 --> 4137.74]  Now,
[4138.74 --> 4139.68]  again,
[4139.82 --> 4140.30]  the Bible
[4140.30 --> 4142.34]  isn't
[4142.34 --> 4142.96]  actually
[4142.96 --> 4143.78]  interested
[4143.78 --> 4145.14]  in solving
[4145.14 --> 4146.66]  the difficulty
[4146.66 --> 4147.74]  of God's
[4147.74 --> 4148.56]  supreme
[4148.56 --> 4149.44]  sovereignty
[4149.44 --> 4150.36]  and His
[4150.36 --> 4151.06]  providence
[4151.06 --> 4152.48]  and human
[4152.48 --> 4153.28]  responsibility.
[4155.18 --> 4155.90]  But what we
[4155.90 --> 4156.54]  see over and
[4156.54 --> 4157.16]  over again
[4157.16 --> 4157.88]  is that it
[4157.88 --> 4158.40]  is both
[4158.40 --> 4159.16]  true that
[4159.16 --> 4159.92]  not a hair
[4159.92 --> 4160.42]  can fall
[4160.42 --> 4160.78]  from my
[4160.78 --> 4161.24]  head without
[4161.24 --> 4161.64]  the will
[4161.64 --> 4161.92]  of my
[4161.92 --> 4162.38]  Father in
[4162.38 --> 4162.60]  heaven,
[4162.94 --> 4164.28]  and I
[4164.28 --> 4165.16]  still have
[4165.16 --> 4165.96]  to cut,
[4166.46 --> 4166.82]  wash,
[4167.14 --> 4167.48]  comb,
[4167.68 --> 4168.36]  and style
[4168.36 --> 4168.86]  my hair.
[4170.12 --> 4170.92]  I have a
[4170.92 --> 4171.78]  responsibility to
[4171.78 --> 4172.32]  take care of
[4172.32 --> 4172.48]  it.
[4173.62 --> 4174.34]  It's true
[4174.34 --> 4175.20]  both that,
[4175.20 --> 4175.50]  yes,
[4175.62 --> 4176.28]  every good
[4176.28 --> 4176.86]  and perfect
[4176.86 --> 4177.66]  gift comes
[4177.66 --> 4178.22]  from above,
[4178.36 --> 4178.92]  James 1,
[4179.00 --> 4179.58]  verse 17.
[4180.00 --> 4180.52]  It's true
[4180.52 --> 4181.30]  that God
[4181.30 --> 4182.06]  Himself gives
[4182.06 --> 4182.96]  everyone life,
[4183.18 --> 4183.42]  breath,
[4183.52 --> 4184.38]  and everything
[4184.38 --> 4184.88]  else,
[4184.98 --> 4185.80]  Acts 17,
[4185.90 --> 4186.38]  24,
[4186.90 --> 4189.38]  and you
[4189.38 --> 4189.86]  must not
[4189.86 --> 4190.46]  be lazy
[4190.46 --> 4191.48]  or idle.
[4192.88 --> 4193.12]  Right?
[4193.14 --> 4193.74]  As Paul says
[4193.74 --> 4194.48]  in 1 Corinthians,
[4195.00 --> 4195.16]  right,
[4195.24 --> 4195.94]  always give
[4195.94 --> 4196.76]  yourselves fully
[4196.76 --> 4197.34]  to the work
[4197.34 --> 4197.86]  of the Lord
[4197.86 --> 4198.36]  because you
[4198.36 --> 4198.72]  know that
[4198.72 --> 4199.22]  your labor
[4199.22 --> 4199.86]  in the Lord
[4199.86 --> 4200.76]  is not in
[4200.76 --> 4201.24]  vain.
[4202.10 --> 4202.44]  Likewise,
[4202.62 --> 4203.48]  in Revelation 2,
[4203.74 --> 4204.34]  the church of
[4204.34 --> 4204.98]  Ephesus is
[4204.98 --> 4205.74]  praised by
[4205.74 --> 4206.12]  the very
[4206.12 --> 4206.70]  mouth of
[4206.70 --> 4207.50]  Jesus when
[4207.50 --> 4208.16]  He says
[4208.16 --> 4208.58]  to this
[4208.58 --> 4208.80]  church,
[4208.94 --> 4209.48]  I know
[4209.48 --> 4210.36]  your deeds,
[4210.76 --> 4211.28]  your hard
[4211.28 --> 4211.68]  work,
[4212.12 --> 4212.62]  and your
[4212.62 --> 4213.12]  perseverance.
[4214.50 --> 4215.26]  These aren't
[4215.26 --> 4216.12]  contradictions.
[4217.64 --> 4218.04]  Rather,
[4218.86 --> 4219.78]  they speak
[4219.78 --> 4221.30]  to the scope
[4221.30 --> 4222.28]  of God's
[4222.28 --> 4222.98]  sovereignty,
[4224.02 --> 4224.80]  such that
[4224.80 --> 4225.34]  everything,
[4225.76 --> 4226.36]  everyone,
[4226.58 --> 4227.22]  everywhere
[4227.22 --> 4228.18]  falls under
[4228.18 --> 4228.74]  His rule.
[4229.32 --> 4229.76]  Everything,
[4230.10 --> 4230.62]  everyone,
[4230.82 --> 4231.44]  everywhere
[4231.44 --> 4232.24]  lives,
[4232.52 --> 4232.88]  moves,
[4233.02 --> 4233.56]  and has
[4233.56 --> 4234.24]  His or
[4234.24 --> 4234.74]  her or
[4234.74 --> 4235.38]  its being
[4235.38 --> 4235.86]  in Him.
[4236.58 --> 4237.58]  He upholds
[4237.58 --> 4238.62]  and directs
[4238.62 --> 4239.64]  all that
[4239.64 --> 4240.74]  it means.
[4241.62 --> 4242.14]  And that
[4242.14 --> 4242.86]  means the
[4242.86 --> 4243.62]  means and
[4243.62 --> 4244.74]  the ends.
[4245.46 --> 4245.98]  The beginning,
[4246.32 --> 4246.92]  the middle,
[4247.08 --> 4247.88]  and the end.
[4248.60 --> 4248.88]  What this
[4248.88 --> 4249.48]  means is,
[4249.70 --> 4250.38]  God is not
[4250.38 --> 4251.14]  surprised,
[4251.60 --> 4252.04]  God's not
[4252.04 --> 4252.48]  caught off
[4252.48 --> 4252.82]  guard,
[4252.92 --> 4253.26]  He's never
[4253.26 --> 4254.18]  caught unawares,
[4254.44 --> 4255.24]  and it
[4255.24 --> 4256.16]  means that
[4256.16 --> 4256.96]  you have
[4256.96 --> 4257.82]  a responsibility
[4257.82 --> 4259.36]  and that we
[4259.36 --> 4260.26]  are accountable
[4260.26 --> 4261.54]  accountable for
[4261.54 --> 4262.44]  our intentions
[4262.44 --> 4263.40]  and the
[4263.40 --> 4264.46]  actions that
[4264.46 --> 4264.78]  result.
[4266.00 --> 4266.36]  And this,
[4266.50 --> 4266.56]  too,
[4266.66 --> 4267.20]  comes out of
[4267.20 --> 4267.68]  the story
[4267.68 --> 4268.72]  of Joseph,
[4269.16 --> 4269.96]  chapter 50,
[4270.24 --> 4270.80]  verse 20.
[4270.90 --> 4271.16]  Again,
[4272.02 --> 4272.92]  you intended
[4272.92 --> 4274.20]  to harm
[4274.20 --> 4274.60]  me,
[4275.48 --> 4275.96]  Joseph said
[4275.96 --> 4276.26]  to his
[4276.26 --> 4276.56]  brothers.
[4277.08 --> 4277.42]  That is,
[4277.50 --> 4278.34]  your intentions,
[4278.60 --> 4279.50]  the desires
[4279.50 --> 4280.54]  of his
[4280.54 --> 4280.88]  brothers,
[4281.06 --> 4281.62]  their will
[4281.62 --> 4282.08]  and their
[4282.08 --> 4282.66]  plan and
[4282.66 --> 4283.14]  the action
[4283.14 --> 4283.80]  that resulted
[4283.80 --> 4284.40]  from it,
[4284.76 --> 4285.32]  they are
[4285.32 --> 4286.20]  responsible for
[4286.20 --> 4286.40]  that.
[4286.50 --> 4287.08]  They are to
[4287.08 --> 4287.38]  be held
[4287.38 --> 4288.50]  accountable for
[4288.50 --> 4288.74]  that.
[4289.10 --> 4289.60]  And,
[4289.68 --> 4290.26]  it is also
[4290.26 --> 4290.64]  true,
[4291.14 --> 4291.94]  God intended
[4291.94 --> 4293.08]  it for good
[4293.08 --> 4293.72]  to accomplish
[4293.72 --> 4294.32]  what is now
[4294.32 --> 4294.84]  being done,
[4294.98 --> 4295.44]  the saving
[4295.44 --> 4296.26]  of many
[4296.26 --> 4296.68]  lives.
[4297.30 --> 4298.28]  The intentions,
[4298.60 --> 4298.94]  actions,
[4299.14 --> 4299.80]  and responsibilities
[4299.80 --> 4300.90]  of people
[4300.90 --> 4302.76]  are both
[4302.76 --> 4304.20]  their own
[4304.20 --> 4306.52]  and part
[4306.52 --> 4307.18]  of God's
[4307.18 --> 4308.52]  good plan.
[4309.66 --> 4310.36]  In fact,
[4311.10 --> 4312.34]  God is so
[4312.34 --> 4313.58]  powerful,
[4313.96 --> 4315.40]  so omnipotent
[4315.40 --> 4317.12]  that it
[4317.12 --> 4317.96]  can't be
[4317.96 --> 4318.60]  any other
[4318.60 --> 4319.80]  way if
[4319.80 --> 4320.18]  God is
[4320.18 --> 4320.50]  God.
[4322.04 --> 4322.96]  And still,
[4323.60 --> 4324.00]  the brothers
[4324.00 --> 4324.86]  are responsible
[4324.86 --> 4325.86]  and culpable
[4325.86 --> 4326.74]  and guilty
[4326.74 --> 4327.52]  for their
[4327.52 --> 4328.26]  intentions,
[4328.50 --> 4329.04]  which are
[4329.04 --> 4329.76]  evil and
[4329.76 --> 4330.18]  the acts
[4330.18 --> 4331.00]  that came
[4331.00 --> 4331.26]  out of
[4331.26 --> 4331.42]  them.
[4332.62 --> 4333.12]  In the
[4333.12 --> 4333.46]  end,
[4333.74 --> 4333.92]  their
[4333.92 --> 4334.60]  responsibility
[4334.60 --> 4335.52]  doesn't
[4335.52 --> 4336.24]  undermine
[4336.24 --> 4336.86]  God's
[4336.86 --> 4337.66]  providence
[4337.66 --> 4338.30]  and sovereign
[4338.30 --> 4338.68]  will,
[4338.96 --> 4339.34]  it is
[4339.34 --> 4340.00]  incorporated
[4340.00 --> 4340.88]  by God
[4340.88 --> 4341.50]  into
[4341.50 --> 4342.26]  his work
[4342.26 --> 4343.20]  in the
[4343.20 --> 4343.46]  world.
[4343.46 --> 4343.50]  world.
[4345.10 --> 4345.84]  And so,
[4346.08 --> 4347.12]  let's pull
[4347.12 --> 4347.60]  all of this
[4347.60 --> 4348.04]  together
[4348.04 --> 4349.44]  here at the
[4349.44 --> 4349.66]  end.
[4351.30 --> 4352.30]  The story
[4352.30 --> 4352.82]  of Joseph
[4352.82 --> 4353.58]  is given
[4353.58 --> 4354.24]  to us
[4354.24 --> 4354.72]  as a
[4354.72 --> 4355.14]  testimony
[4355.14 --> 4355.96]  of a
[4355.96 --> 4356.58]  faith hero
[4356.58 --> 4357.34]  because he
[4357.34 --> 4358.04]  is a
[4358.04 --> 4358.38]  lived
[4358.38 --> 4358.98]  example
[4358.98 --> 4359.56]  of the
[4359.56 --> 4360.20]  security
[4360.20 --> 4361.74]  and assurance
[4361.74 --> 4362.74]  of God's
[4362.74 --> 4363.22]  sovereign
[4363.22 --> 4363.80]  rule
[4363.80 --> 4364.44]  in the
[4364.44 --> 4364.70]  world.
[4364.70 --> 4365.16]  And he
[4365.16 --> 4365.90]  shows us
[4365.90 --> 4366.28]  that we
[4366.28 --> 4366.60]  have a
[4366.60 --> 4367.12]  responsibility
[4367.12 --> 4368.52]  to work
[4368.52 --> 4369.02]  and to be
[4369.02 --> 4369.40]  diligent
[4369.40 --> 4369.92]  and to
[4369.92 --> 4370.38]  make the
[4370.38 --> 4370.86]  most of
[4370.86 --> 4371.18]  whatever
[4371.18 --> 4372.00]  circumstances
[4372.00 --> 4372.90]  that we
[4372.90 --> 4373.54]  find ourselves
[4373.54 --> 4373.80]  in,
[4374.04 --> 4374.54]  in the
[4374.54 --> 4375.12]  confidence
[4375.12 --> 4376.24]  of God's
[4376.24 --> 4376.70]  sovereign
[4376.70 --> 4377.10]  rule.
[4378.04 --> 4378.40]  In fact,
[4378.52 --> 4378.88]  God's
[4378.88 --> 4379.50]  sovereignty
[4379.50 --> 4380.38]  is an
[4380.38 --> 4380.92]  encouragement
[4380.92 --> 4382.10]  for all
[4382.10 --> 4383.40]  of life.
[4385.04 --> 4385.68]  And
[4385.68 --> 4386.72]  Joseph's
[4386.72 --> 4387.44]  story shows
[4387.44 --> 4388.32]  us that
[4388.32 --> 4388.72]  God's
[4388.72 --> 4389.54]  providence
[4389.54 --> 4390.92]  is always
[4390.92 --> 4391.90]  good.
[4393.60 --> 4394.22]  So many
[4394.22 --> 4394.66]  of us
[4394.66 --> 4395.72]  are familiar
[4395.72 --> 4396.02]  with
[4396.02 --> 4396.34]  Jeremiah
[4396.34 --> 4396.92]  29
[4396.92 --> 4397.80]  verse 11.
[4398.52 --> 4398.88]  Jeremiah
[4398.88 --> 4399.44]  29
[4399.44 --> 4400.02]  verse 11
[4400.02 --> 4401.58]  is part
[4401.58 --> 4402.06]  of a
[4402.06 --> 4402.32]  letter
[4402.32 --> 4402.66]  that the
[4402.66 --> 4402.90]  prophet
[4402.90 --> 4403.44]  Jeremiah
[4403.44 --> 4403.88]  writes
[4403.88 --> 4404.24]  to the
[4404.24 --> 4404.84]  exiles
[4404.84 --> 4405.64]  who have
[4405.64 --> 4406.64]  been taken
[4406.64 --> 4407.04]  away
[4407.04 --> 4407.72]  in Babylon
[4407.72 --> 4408.44]  to Babylon.
[4409.44 --> 4409.56]  And
[4409.56 --> 4410.58]  God speaks
[4410.58 --> 4410.92]  through the
[4410.92 --> 4411.18]  prophet.
[4411.32 --> 4411.98]  He says,
[4412.64 --> 4413.10]  for I know
[4413.10 --> 4413.72]  the plans
[4413.72 --> 4414.14]  I have
[4414.14 --> 4414.48]  for you,
[4414.60 --> 4414.86]  declares
[4414.86 --> 4415.32]  the Lord,
[4416.02 --> 4416.52]  plans to
[4416.52 --> 4417.24]  prosper you
[4417.24 --> 4417.52]  and not
[4417.52 --> 4417.92]  to harm
[4417.92 --> 4418.10]  you,
[4418.18 --> 4418.58]  plans to
[4418.58 --> 4418.82]  give you
[4418.82 --> 4419.28]  a hope
[4419.28 --> 4420.18]  and a
[4420.18 --> 4420.52]  future.
[4421.52 --> 4421.96]  And for
[4421.96 --> 4422.34]  Jeremiah
[4422.34 --> 4423.00]  and for
[4423.00 --> 4423.40]  the people
[4423.40 --> 4423.82]  in
[4423.82 --> 4424.54]  Babylonian
[4424.54 --> 4424.96]  exile,
[4425.10 --> 4425.62]  that means
[4425.62 --> 4426.34]  an end
[4426.34 --> 4426.80]  to their
[4426.80 --> 4427.22]  exile.
[4428.10 --> 4428.48]  For
[4428.48 --> 4428.86]  Joseph,
[4429.10 --> 4429.68]  that means
[4429.68 --> 4430.46]  an exodus
[4430.46 --> 4431.92]  from Egypt.
[4432.80 --> 4433.18]  And for
[4433.18 --> 4433.64]  us,
[4433.68 --> 4434.34]  that means
[4434.34 --> 4435.12]  a resurrection
[4435.12 --> 4436.04]  and the
[4436.04 --> 4436.90]  full coming
[4436.90 --> 4437.18]  of the
[4437.18 --> 4437.44]  kingdom
[4437.44 --> 4438.02]  of God.
[4439.16 --> 4439.78]  And so,
[4439.92 --> 4440.36]  whether in
[4440.36 --> 4441.14]  life or
[4441.14 --> 4441.90]  in death,
[4442.12 --> 4442.56]  we have
[4442.56 --> 4443.00]  comfort,
[4443.30 --> 4443.52]  we have
[4443.52 --> 4443.82]  hope,
[4444.12 --> 4444.52]  and even
[4444.52 --> 4445.42]  joy because
[4445.42 --> 4447.32]  we know
[4447.32 --> 4448.28]  the plans
[4448.28 --> 4449.46]  God has
[4449.46 --> 4450.04]  for us.
[4450.04 --> 4450.16]  plans.
[4451.76 --> 4452.34]  And it
[4452.34 --> 4452.80]  means that
[4452.80 --> 4453.52]  even as
[4453.52 --> 4454.40]  God makes
[4454.40 --> 4455.12]  plans,
[4456.22 --> 4457.04]  we make
[4457.04 --> 4457.52]  plans.
[4458.20 --> 4459.02]  Plans even
[4459.02 --> 4459.56]  in the face
[4459.56 --> 4459.98]  of death,
[4460.06 --> 4460.22]  right?
[4460.30 --> 4460.98]  Joseph said,
[4461.32 --> 4461.76]  even in the
[4461.76 --> 4462.16]  face of
[4462.16 --> 4462.34]  death,
[4462.44 --> 4462.84]  you must
[4462.84 --> 4463.44]  carry my
[4463.44 --> 4464.20]  bones up
[4464.20 --> 4464.76]  from this
[4464.76 --> 4465.16]  place.
[4465.32 --> 4465.74]  And so,
[4465.96 --> 4467.06]  we make
[4467.06 --> 4467.68]  plans.
[4469.32 --> 4469.60]  And in
[4469.60 --> 4469.76]  fact,
[4470.56 --> 4471.66]  and I know
[4471.66 --> 4472.68]  this is a
[4472.68 --> 4473.16]  really bold
[4473.16 --> 4473.70]  thing to
[4473.70 --> 4474.00]  say,
[4474.00 --> 4475.64]  but the
[4475.64 --> 4476.72]  only reason
[4476.72 --> 4477.72]  you have
[4477.72 --> 4478.12]  to make
[4478.12 --> 4478.68]  plans,
[4479.18 --> 4479.74]  the only
[4479.74 --> 4480.40]  reason that
[4480.40 --> 4480.60]  you can
[4480.60 --> 4480.92]  have any
[4480.92 --> 4481.36]  confidence
[4481.36 --> 4482.08]  in the
[4482.08 --> 4482.50]  plans that
[4482.50 --> 4482.98]  you make
[4482.98 --> 4484.20]  is that
[4484.20 --> 4484.88]  the future
[4484.88 --> 4486.04]  might actually
[4486.04 --> 4486.36]  come.
[4488.06 --> 4488.46]  The only
[4488.46 --> 4488.80]  reason you
[4488.80 --> 4489.02]  can have
[4489.02 --> 4489.56]  that confidence
[4489.56 --> 4490.34]  is because
[4490.34 --> 4491.48]  of the
[4491.48 --> 4492.28]  sovereignty
[4492.28 --> 4493.98]  of God
[4493.98 --> 4495.44]  and the
[4495.44 --> 4495.96]  power
[4495.96 --> 4497.56]  of His
[4497.56 --> 4498.18]  providence.
[4499.22 --> 4499.88]  And that
[4499.88 --> 4500.96]  changes
[4500.96 --> 4502.24]  everything
[4502.24 --> 4503.18]  about every
[4503.18 --> 4504.34]  day of
[4504.34 --> 4504.82]  your life,
[4505.00 --> 4506.04]  but especially,
[4506.66 --> 4509.30]  especially as
[4509.30 --> 4509.70]  you face
[4509.70 --> 4510.02]  death.
[4512.10 --> 4512.84]  So,
[4512.92 --> 4513.04]  I was
[4513.04 --> 4513.46]  reflecting
[4513.46 --> 4514.36]  this week.
[4515.58 --> 4516.42]  I was
[4516.42 --> 4517.02]  thinking about
[4517.02 --> 4518.08]  the very
[4518.08 --> 4519.28]  first funeral
[4519.28 --> 4519.84]  I ever
[4519.84 --> 4520.70]  officiated as
[4520.70 --> 4521.14]  a pastor.
[4522.86 --> 4524.00]  I was
[4524.00 --> 4526.24]  28 years
[4526.24 --> 4526.66]  old,
[4526.92 --> 4527.62]  maybe like
[4527.62 --> 4528.56]  four months
[4528.56 --> 4529.74]  into my
[4529.74 --> 4530.38]  ministry,
[4530.96 --> 4531.72]  my first
[4531.72 --> 4532.72]  charge as
[4532.72 --> 4533.24]  a pastor.
[4534.34 --> 4534.90]  So,
[4534.96 --> 4535.62]  I just
[4535.62 --> 4536.36]  started getting
[4536.36 --> 4536.76]  to know
[4536.76 --> 4537.44]  these people
[4537.44 --> 4538.98]  and John
[4538.98 --> 4539.48]  Backer,
[4540.02 --> 4540.52]  senior
[4540.52 --> 4541.32]  statesman
[4541.32 --> 4542.16]  of the
[4542.16 --> 4542.42]  church,
[4542.54 --> 4542.80]  one of
[4542.80 --> 4543.44]  the charter
[4543.44 --> 4544.04]  members
[4544.04 --> 4545.12]  of this
[4545.12 --> 4545.68]  community,
[4546.16 --> 4546.52]  had been
[4546.52 --> 4546.94]  sick for
[4546.94 --> 4547.52]  about 25
[4547.52 --> 4548.00]  years.
[4549.30 --> 4549.54]  Right?
[4549.60 --> 4549.96]  He had
[4549.96 --> 4551.26]  lung issues,
[4551.40 --> 4551.90]  he was on
[4551.90 --> 4553.52]  a respirator,
[4553.60 --> 4554.00]  he carried
[4554.00 --> 4554.48]  an oxygen
[4554.48 --> 4555.04]  tank with
[4555.04 --> 4555.48]  him wherever
[4555.48 --> 4556.04]  he went,
[4557.42 --> 4559.16]  and before
[4559.16 --> 4559.64]  I had
[4559.64 --> 4560.22]  started there,
[4560.28 --> 4560.52]  he was
[4560.52 --> 4561.06]  already in
[4561.06 --> 4561.56]  the hospital.
[4562.42 --> 4562.86]  Four months
[4562.86 --> 4563.16]  later,
[4563.24 --> 4564.18]  he was
[4564.18 --> 4565.04]  on his
[4565.04 --> 4565.56]  deathbed.
[4566.46 --> 4567.36]  John and
[4567.36 --> 4567.70]  his wife
[4567.70 --> 4568.12]  Grace,
[4568.66 --> 4569.38]  beautiful
[4569.38 --> 4570.64]  saints in
[4570.64 --> 4571.06]  the church.
[4572.26 --> 4572.94]  Every time
[4572.94 --> 4573.34]  I went to
[4573.34 --> 4573.96]  visit John,
[4575.14 --> 4575.82]  even though
[4575.82 --> 4576.28]  he knew
[4576.28 --> 4576.70]  he was
[4576.70 --> 4577.28]  near death,
[4578.08 --> 4578.62]  he was
[4578.62 --> 4579.24]  more concerned
[4579.24 --> 4579.72]  with my
[4579.72 --> 4580.16]  well-being,
[4580.86 --> 4581.44]  and how
[4581.44 --> 4581.80]  things were
[4581.80 --> 4582.18]  going in
[4582.18 --> 4582.64]  the church
[4582.64 --> 4583.38]  under my
[4583.38 --> 4584.74]  new leadership
[4584.74 --> 4585.54]  and direction,
[4585.74 --> 4586.64]  and he was
[4586.64 --> 4587.16]  more interested
[4587.16 --> 4587.70]  in hearing
[4587.70 --> 4588.76]  about what's
[4588.76 --> 4589.28]  going on in
[4589.28 --> 4589.74]  my life,
[4589.80 --> 4590.08]  and how
[4590.08 --> 4590.62]  my wife
[4590.62 --> 4591.22]  was adjusting
[4591.22 --> 4591.72]  to the
[4591.72 --> 4592.14]  community,
[4592.40 --> 4594.48]  because he
[4594.48 --> 4595.12]  had a
[4595.12 --> 4595.80]  confidence.
[4596.76 --> 4597.34]  Every time
[4597.34 --> 4597.76]  we would
[4597.76 --> 4598.30]  sit down,
[4598.40 --> 4598.66]  he would
[4598.66 --> 4598.90]  say,
[4599.40 --> 4599.66]  I'm not
[4599.66 --> 4599.90]  worried,
[4600.02 --> 4600.20]  pastor,
[4600.28 --> 4600.58]  I know
[4600.58 --> 4601.22]  exactly
[4601.22 --> 4602.22]  where I'm
[4602.22 --> 4602.52]  going.
[4606.28 --> 4606.90]  When his
[4606.90 --> 4607.50]  time finally
[4607.50 --> 4607.94]  came,
[4609.20 --> 4609.62]  I was
[4609.62 --> 4610.12]  gathered with
[4610.12 --> 4610.48]  him and
[4610.48 --> 4610.98]  his wife
[4610.98 --> 4611.62]  and their
[4611.62 --> 4612.60]  kids in
[4612.60 --> 4613.06]  his hospital
[4613.06 --> 4614.44]  room for
[4614.44 --> 4614.78]  about two
[4614.78 --> 4615.06]  and a half
[4615.06 --> 4615.38]  hours.
[4615.96 --> 4616.54]  We sat
[4616.54 --> 4616.96]  together,
[4616.96 --> 4617.82]  we prayed
[4617.82 --> 4618.26]  together,
[4618.62 --> 4619.12]  we sang
[4619.12 --> 4619.56]  hymns
[4619.56 --> 4619.94]  together,
[4620.46 --> 4621.50]  and we
[4621.50 --> 4622.04]  sang
[4622.04 --> 4622.76]  Amazing
[4622.76 --> 4623.24]  Grace,
[4624.12 --> 4624.64]  and as
[4624.64 --> 4625.20]  we prayed,
[4625.36 --> 4625.82]  I thought,
[4626.14 --> 4626.74]  wouldn't this
[4626.74 --> 4627.30]  be a beautiful
[4627.30 --> 4628.12]  testimony if
[4628.12 --> 4628.58]  he went to
[4628.58 --> 4628.96]  the Lord
[4628.96 --> 4629.40]  while we
[4629.40 --> 4629.70]  sang?
[4630.72 --> 4631.54]  We finished
[4631.54 --> 4632.20]  singing the
[4632.20 --> 4632.48]  song,
[4633.10 --> 4633.90]  I looked at
[4633.90 --> 4634.20]  John,
[4634.30 --> 4634.72]  he took a
[4634.72 --> 4635.28]  deep breath,
[4635.68 --> 4636.08]  and he
[4636.08 --> 4636.36]  stopped
[4636.36 --> 4636.72]  breathing.
[4638.36 --> 4638.80]  Ten
[4638.80 --> 4639.16]  seconds
[4639.16 --> 4639.62]  passed,
[4640.28 --> 4640.68]  fifteen
[4640.68 --> 4641.10]  seconds
[4641.10 --> 4641.56]  passed,
[4642.20 --> 4642.34]  and he
[4642.34 --> 4642.44]  went,
[4642.52 --> 4644.76]  pastor,
[4644.90 --> 4645.12]  you can
[4645.12 --> 4645.36]  leave.
[4646.96 --> 4648.68]  He's like,
[4648.72 --> 4649.02]  don't worry
[4649.02 --> 4649.42]  about me,
[4649.76 --> 4650.40]  I'm okay.
[4651.46 --> 4651.92]  And so I
[4651.92 --> 4652.26]  left.
[4653.10 --> 4653.78]  Before I made
[4653.78 --> 4654.10]  it to the
[4654.10 --> 4654.62]  parking lot,
[4654.70 --> 4655.02]  I got a
[4655.02 --> 4655.34]  phone call
[4655.34 --> 4655.84]  from Grace.
[4656.98 --> 4657.34]  Pastor,
[4657.96 --> 4658.62]  he died.
[4660.64 --> 4661.24]  It's like he
[4661.24 --> 4661.54]  was waiting
[4661.54 --> 4661.94]  for me to
[4661.94 --> 4662.12]  leave,
[4662.18 --> 4662.42]  I don't
[4662.42 --> 4662.62]  know.
[4664.00 --> 4664.54]  But even
[4664.54 --> 4664.84]  in that
[4664.84 --> 4665.28]  moment,
[4666.00 --> 4666.36]  he had
[4666.36 --> 4666.74]  joy,
[4667.54 --> 4667.82]  and he
[4667.82 --> 4668.04]  made a
[4668.04 --> 4668.38]  joke,
[4668.98 --> 4669.50]  he had
[4669.50 --> 4670.00]  confidence,
[4670.48 --> 4671.20]  he knew
[4671.20 --> 4671.82]  where he
[4671.82 --> 4672.44]  was going
[4672.44 --> 4673.30]  and what
[4673.30 --> 4674.02]  laid in
[4674.02 --> 4674.36]  front of
[4674.36 --> 4674.52]  him,
[4674.64 --> 4674.98]  and so
[4674.98 --> 4675.44]  did the
[4675.44 --> 4676.02]  family that
[4676.02 --> 4676.78]  surrounded
[4676.78 --> 4677.04]  him.
[4677.16 --> 4677.64]  That was
[4677.64 --> 4678.24]  a beautiful
[4678.24 --> 4679.28]  testimony of
[4679.28 --> 4680.18]  a man who
[4680.18 --> 4680.94]  knew the
[4680.94 --> 4682.08]  sovereignty of
[4682.08 --> 4682.46]  God and
[4682.46 --> 4683.48]  rested in
[4683.48 --> 4684.20]  the security
[4684.20 --> 4684.78]  of a God
[4684.78 --> 4685.30]  who is in
[4685.30 --> 4685.90]  control no
[4685.90 --> 4686.36]  matter what.
[4686.56 --> 4687.12]  That is the
[4687.12 --> 4687.76]  testimony of
[4687.76 --> 4688.60]  a man who
[4688.60 --> 4689.08]  knew the
[4689.08 --> 4690.58]  power of
[4690.58 --> 4690.90]  God's
[4690.90 --> 4691.44]  providence.
[4694.04 --> 4694.70]  I would
[4694.70 --> 4695.08]  see that
[4695.08 --> 4695.76]  same sort
[4695.76 --> 4696.30]  of testimony
[4696.30 --> 4696.92]  again.
[4698.48 --> 4699.00]  Fast
[4699.00 --> 4700.40]  forward to
[4700.40 --> 4700.94]  2015,
[4701.72 --> 4702.40]  and I
[4702.40 --> 4702.68]  started
[4702.68 --> 4703.32]  preaching a
[4703.32 --> 4704.40]  series on
[4704.40 --> 4705.96]  Joseph in
[4705.96 --> 4706.40]  this church
[4706.40 --> 4706.86]  community,
[4707.66 --> 4708.92]  and the
[4708.92 --> 4709.58]  series was
[4709.58 --> 4710.54]  called God's
[4710.54 --> 4711.76]  Sovereignty and
[4711.76 --> 4712.58]  Human Suffering,
[4713.58 --> 4716.12]  and a man not
[4716.12 --> 4716.66]  from our church
[4716.66 --> 4717.88]  community started
[4717.88 --> 4718.66]  coming to our
[4718.66 --> 4719.30]  evening services
[4719.30 --> 4719.72]  where I was
[4719.72 --> 4720.24]  teaching this
[4720.24 --> 4720.52]  series.
[4722.46 --> 4723.78]  I spent about
[4723.78 --> 4725.30]  six weeks in
[4725.30 --> 4725.92]  this series,
[4726.76 --> 4728.14]  and two weeks
[4728.14 --> 4728.72]  after I
[4728.72 --> 4729.18]  finished,
[4729.76 --> 4730.04]  Louis
[4730.04 --> 4731.04]  Vandenberg came
[4731.04 --> 4731.56]  to me and
[4731.56 --> 4731.86]  said,
[4732.42 --> 4733.90]  the first
[4733.90 --> 4734.46]  Sunday you
[4734.46 --> 4735.14]  started preaching
[4735.14 --> 4735.84]  this series,
[4736.74 --> 4737.72]  I had heard
[4737.72 --> 4738.10]  from my
[4738.10 --> 4738.72]  doctor that I
[4738.72 --> 4739.14]  had a terminal
[4739.14 --> 4740.08]  cancer diagnosis,
[4740.48 --> 4741.36]  and I didn't
[4741.36 --> 4741.82]  know what to
[4741.82 --> 4742.02]  do.
[4743.46 --> 4744.16]  And then I
[4744.16 --> 4744.90]  saw in the
[4744.90 --> 4745.30]  community
[4745.30 --> 4745.94]  bulletin that
[4745.94 --> 4746.20]  you were
[4746.20 --> 4746.66]  preaching this
[4746.66 --> 4746.92]  series,
[4747.02 --> 4747.24]  and I
[4747.24 --> 4747.40]  thought,
[4747.48 --> 4747.70]  I'm going
[4747.70 --> 4748.02]  to come.
[4749.06 --> 4749.54]  As I have
[4749.54 --> 4750.26]  returned every
[4750.26 --> 4751.08]  week because I
[4751.08 --> 4751.90]  needed to hear
[4751.90 --> 4753.32]  this testimony
[4753.32 --> 4754.08]  of who God
[4754.08 --> 4754.38]  is,
[4755.56 --> 4755.74]  Louis
[4755.74 --> 4758.06]  too went
[4758.06 --> 4758.72]  to be with
[4758.72 --> 4759.54]  his Lord in
[4759.54 --> 4760.18]  the confidence
[4760.18 --> 4761.02]  of a sovereign
[4761.02 --> 4761.46]  God,
[4762.58 --> 4763.36]  in the sure
[4763.36 --> 4764.96]  arms of his
[4764.96 --> 4765.94]  providential
[4765.94 --> 4766.84]  power.
[4768.82 --> 4769.58]  Because that's
[4769.58 --> 4770.10]  who our God
[4770.10 --> 4770.46]  is.
[4771.96 --> 4772.52]  That's who
[4772.52 --> 4772.90]  our God
[4772.90 --> 4773.20]  is.
[4774.30 --> 4774.72]  And so even
[4774.72 --> 4775.22]  as you look
[4775.22 --> 4775.72]  to the story
[4775.72 --> 4776.20]  of Joseph,
[4777.12 --> 4777.68]  even as you
[4777.68 --> 4778.04]  look to the
[4778.04 --> 4778.78]  story of John,
[4779.34 --> 4779.76]  even as you
[4779.76 --> 4780.14]  look to the
[4780.14 --> 4780.64]  story of Louis,
[4780.78 --> 4781.94]  whoever's story
[4781.94 --> 4782.90]  you are thinking
[4782.90 --> 4783.70]  about right now,
[4783.76 --> 4784.84]  or however you
[4784.84 --> 4785.30]  are thinking
[4785.30 --> 4785.82]  about making
[4785.82 --> 4786.56]  this your
[4786.56 --> 4787.44]  story,
[4787.80 --> 4788.22]  no.
[4788.72 --> 4789.62]  that our
[4789.62 --> 4791.18]  good God
[4791.18 --> 4792.64]  is sovereign,
[4793.66 --> 4794.26]  that he
[4794.26 --> 4795.34]  rules in
[4795.34 --> 4796.44]  this world,
[4796.56 --> 4797.22]  and that he
[4797.22 --> 4798.68]  has a plan
[4798.68 --> 4799.80]  and a purpose,
[4800.00 --> 4800.78]  and in his
[4800.78 --> 4801.76]  providence,
[4802.06 --> 4803.40]  it is
[4803.40 --> 4804.50]  good.
[4805.98 --> 4807.28]  This is
[4807.28 --> 4807.88]  our
[4807.88 --> 4809.14]  God,
[4809.72 --> 4810.52]  and he
[4810.52 --> 4811.62]  is
[4811.62 --> 4812.64]  good.
[4813.36 --> 4813.68]  Amen.
[4813.68 --> 4813.78]  Amen.
[4814.36 --> 4815.10]  Let's pray
[4815.10 --> 4815.42]  together.
[4815.42 --> 4823.36]  Holy God,
[4823.44 --> 4824.02]  as we come
[4824.02 --> 4824.76]  to you in
[4824.76 --> 4825.12]  prayer,
[4825.82 --> 4827.86]  we have
[4827.86 --> 4828.20]  on our
[4828.20 --> 4828.66]  hearts and
[4828.66 --> 4829.16]  our minds
[4829.16 --> 4829.62]  people,
[4829.92 --> 4830.20]  we have
[4830.20 --> 4830.40]  in our
[4830.40 --> 4830.76]  hearts and
[4830.76 --> 4831.16]  our minds
[4831.16 --> 4831.82]  circumstances
[4831.82 --> 4832.98]  and stories,
[4833.54 --> 4833.98]  we have
[4833.98 --> 4834.46]  in our minds
[4834.46 --> 4835.32]  situations,
[4836.26 --> 4836.78]  and I pray,
[4836.94 --> 4837.28]  Lord God,
[4837.36 --> 4838.04]  that in and
[4838.04 --> 4838.78]  through each
[4838.78 --> 4839.54]  of those,
[4839.66 --> 4840.24]  you would
[4840.24 --> 4841.02]  make yourself
[4841.02 --> 4841.32]  known,
[4841.38 --> 4841.98]  that in and
[4841.98 --> 4842.82]  through each
[4842.82 --> 4843.24]  of those,
[4843.36 --> 4843.78]  we might
[4843.78 --> 4844.62]  rest secure
[4844.62 --> 4845.48]  in the
[4845.48 --> 4846.14]  promise and
[4846.14 --> 4846.82]  power of
[4846.82 --> 4847.74]  your sovereignty
[4847.74 --> 4848.88]  and providence.
[4849.36 --> 4850.14]  Help us to
[4850.14 --> 4851.12]  know you
[4851.12 --> 4852.38]  more completely
[4852.38 --> 4853.00]  and more
[4853.00 --> 4853.38]  truly,
[4853.38 --> 4854.08]  and help us
[4854.08 --> 4855.10]  to rest
[4855.10 --> 4856.32]  in that
[4856.32 --> 4857.58]  truth today.
[4859.10 --> 4859.90]  And so,
[4860.02 --> 4860.28]  whether we
[4860.28 --> 4860.96]  face life
[4860.96 --> 4862.24]  or death,
[4863.30 --> 4863.90]  whether we
[4863.90 --> 4865.04]  face a
[4865.04 --> 4865.54]  transition
[4865.54 --> 4866.32]  or more
[4866.32 --> 4866.64]  of the
[4866.64 --> 4866.88]  same,
[4868.04 --> 4868.60]  I pray,
[4868.72 --> 4869.00]  Lord God,
[4869.04 --> 4869.58]  that we would
[4869.58 --> 4870.64]  face that
[4870.64 --> 4871.12]  in the
[4871.12 --> 4871.82]  confidence
[4871.82 --> 4872.76]  of who
[4872.76 --> 4874.14]  you are.
[4875.14 --> 4875.58]  As we
[4875.58 --> 4875.92]  look to
[4875.92 --> 4876.22]  Joseph,
[4876.44 --> 4876.90]  help us
[4876.90 --> 4877.58]  to see
[4877.58 --> 4878.30]  you.
[4878.96 --> 4879.44]  As we
[4879.44 --> 4879.66]  look to
[4879.66 --> 4880.06]  those people
[4880.06 --> 4880.32]  that you
[4880.32 --> 4880.84]  have placed
[4880.84 --> 4881.30]  in our
[4881.30 --> 4881.66]  lives,
[4881.78 --> 4882.36]  help us
[4882.36 --> 4883.22]  to know
[4883.22 --> 4884.20]  you.
[4885.12 --> 4885.64]  In your
[4885.64 --> 4886.02]  name we
[4886.02 --> 4886.30]  pray.
[4887.30 --> 4887.68]  Amen.
[4901.82 --> 4910.60]  or
[4910.74 --> 4911.38]  to be
[4913.38 --> 4914.50]  on this
[4914.54 --> 4916.32]  we
[4920.32 --> 4920.44]  today.
[4920.44 --> 4926.44]  God is only true.
[4928.20 --> 4933.44]  The sinner, man, and the power
[4933.96 --> 4938.44]  has been on Jesus' way.
[4943.44 --> 4948.44]  Silent as he stood on youth,
[4948.44 --> 4954.44]  beaten up his sword.
[4955.44 --> 4960.44]  Gowing to the Father's will,
[4961.44 --> 4966.44]  he took the cross and forth.
[4967.44 --> 4972.44]  For your prophet bless my salvation,
[4972.44 --> 4978.44]  where your love for you will be.
[4979.44 --> 4984.44]  Now my soul cries out, hallelujah,
[4985.44 --> 4990.44]  praise and honor unto thee.
[4990.44 --> 4999.44]  The saint of heaven's love's love
[5000.44 --> 5005.44]  to purchase and redeem.
[5006.44 --> 5012.44]  The man in style of every voice
[5012.44 --> 5018.44]  who meld into the church.
[5019.44 --> 5024.44]  The black and cross my salvation,
[5025.44 --> 5030.44]  where your love for you will be.
[5030.44 --> 5036.44]  Now my soul cries out, hallelujah,
[5037.44 --> 5042.44]  praise and honor unto thee.
[5042.44 --> 5045.44]  The Lord, my God, and the power of you will be.
[5046.44 --> 5048.44]  The Lord, my God, and the power of you will be.
[5048.44 --> 5052.44]  God is free, it is paid in foe,
[5052.44 --> 5054.44]  Father precious care,
[5055.44 --> 5058.44]  God my Jesus, fear.
[5058.44 --> 5064.44]  Now the curse of sin has no hold on thee,
[5065.44 --> 5070.44]  In the sans' free, all is free indeed.
[5070.44 --> 5077.70]  How I'm dead is good, it is made in love.
[5077.96 --> 5083.44]  I'm the precious blood that my Jesus knew.
[5084.32 --> 5090.36]  How the curse of sin has no hold on me.
[5090.66 --> 5095.44]  In the sand search free, how is free indeed.
[5095.44 --> 5102.08]  For the power of the cross, the salvation.
[5102.90 --> 5108.14]  Where your love goes out, over me.
[5108.88 --> 5114.26]  How I saw the love, hallelujah.
[5114.26 --> 5119.46]  Is it all a right to me?
[5119.46 --> 5130.86]  See the stone is rolled away.
[5131.32 --> 5136.20]  Behold the empty tomb.
[5136.20 --> 5143.08]  Hallelujah, God we praise.
[5143.42 --> 5148.60]  He's raised upon your grace.
[5148.60 --> 5154.32]  For the broken cross, the salvation.
[5155.06 --> 5160.24]  Where your love goes out, over me.
[5160.24 --> 5166.24]  How I saw the love, hallelujah.
[5166.24 --> 5171.66]  Praise and honor all to me.
[5172.70 --> 5178.70]  Praise and honor all to me.
[5178.70 --> 5194.84]  As we go, we go in the security and the power of God going with us.
[5194.84 --> 5206.36]  As I speak the blessing, I encourage you to pay particular attention to how these statements of who God is are true for us, are compelling for us.
[5206.66 --> 5213.96]  Because God is sovereign and he acts providentially in the world on behalf of his people.
[5214.44 --> 5216.32]  Receive God's blessing.
[5218.12 --> 5221.04]  God goes before you to lead you.
[5221.74 --> 5223.84]  God go behind you to protect you.
[5223.84 --> 5226.36]  God go beneath you to support you.
[5226.74 --> 5229.28]  God go beside you to befriend you.
[5229.60 --> 5231.88]  Do not be afraid.
[5233.08 --> 5235.50]  May the blessing of God come upon you today.
[5235.66 --> 5237.86]  Do not be afraid.
[5238.90 --> 5245.96]  But go in peace in life and in death to love and serve the Lord.
[5247.16 --> 5247.76]  Amen.
[5253.84 --> 5269.74]  The world that you areAll done.
[5271.40 --> 5272.58]  The Lord is also blessed.
[5272.68 --> 5277.10]  Praise and profess to you.
