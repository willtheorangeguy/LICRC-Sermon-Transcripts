[0.00 --> 16.42]  For God alone, I wait in silence.
[17.18 --> 22.62]  My soul is still before the Lord.
[22.62 --> 30.12]  He is my rock and my salvation.
[31.06 --> 37.82]  My fortress strong, I'll trust in Him.
[38.22 --> 44.16]  I'll not be shaken, I'll not be shaken.
[44.16 --> 52.10]  For all my hope is in His love.
[52.10 --> 58.22]  From God alone comes my salvation.
[59.44 --> 65.22]  I'll wait and trust His steadfast love.
[65.22 --> 95.22] 
[95.22 --> 104.22]  For Almighty, who turned to God alone for help.
[104.22 --> 111.56]  I'll not be shaken, I'll not be shaken.
[111.56 --> 118.90]  For all my hope is in His love.
[118.90 --> 125.36]  From God alone comes my salvation.
[125.36 --> 155.36] 
[155.36 --> 156.36]  I'll hear you cry.
[156.36 --> 164.36]  No other hope will never fail you.
[164.36 --> 171.70]  No other love will never fail.
[171.70 --> 178.70]  I'll not be shaken, I'll not be shaken.
[178.70 --> 186.04]  For all my hope is in His love.
[186.04 --> 193.04]  From God alone comes my salvation.
[193.04 --> 200.04]  I'll wait and trust His steadfast love.
[200.04 --> 207.04]  I'll wait and trust His steadfast love.
[207.04 --> 215.02]  To be heard and touch His steadfast love.
[216.02 --> 217.14]  To be heard of Him, this love won't be shaken.
[217.22 --> 227.60]  It won't be bare as a day.
[227.60 --> 234.30]  I've seen shame, the kind that comes from mistakes
[234.30 --> 237.26]  The kind that won't go away
[237.26 --> 241.94]  When I turned around, they were right there to remind me
[241.94 --> 247.44]  I've seen regret, the kind that messes with your hair
[247.44 --> 250.64]  The failures and the can't forgets
[250.64 --> 255.18]  But standing here now, I'm thinking God it's behind me
[255.18 --> 261.20]  Cause I've seen nails, scarred hands reach out and wipe it all away
[261.20 --> 267.26]  Now I see grace, hallelujah, I stand amazed
[267.26 --> 270.60]  I'm staring at an empty grave
[270.60 --> 274.44]  And the stone that drew rolled away
[274.44 --> 278.62]  When I was a prideful, you saw the sun
[278.62 --> 282.00]  When I left the night and night, you saw the one
[282.00 --> 286.94]  And just like that, all my past has been erased
[286.94 --> 290.56]  When I look back, I see grace
[290.56 --> 297.06]  I still hurt, fall short on what you say I'm worth
[297.06 --> 301.82]  And that devil says I don't deserve what you did on the cross
[301.82 --> 305.44]  And he's right, cause I don't, but you did it anyway
[305.44 --> 310.38]  I see grace, hallelujah, I stand amazed
[310.38 --> 313.56]  I'm staring at an empty grave
[313.56 --> 317.40]  And the stone that drew rolled away
[317.40 --> 321.66]  When I was a prideful, you saw the sun
[321.66 --> 325.02]  When I left the night and night, you saw the one
[325.02 --> 329.44]  And just like that, all my past has been erased
[329.44 --> 335.88]  When I look back, I see grace, grace
[335.88 --> 339.28]  God's grace
[339.28 --> 342.42]  Grace that is greater than all my sin
[342.42 --> 345.68]  Faith God Almighty gonna see it again
[345.68 --> 349.20]  Oh, grace, grace
[349.20 --> 352.52]  God's grace
[352.52 --> 358.96]  Grace that is greater than all my sin
[358.96 --> 365.12]  I see grace, hallelujah, I stand amazed
[365.12 --> 368.08]  I'm staring at an empty grave
[368.08 --> 371.78]  And the stone that drew rolled away
[371.78 --> 373.78]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[373.78 --> 376.34]  I was a prideful, you saw the sun
[376.34 --> 379.62]  When I left the night and night, you saw the one
[379.62 --> 384.58]  And just like that, all my past has been erased
[384.58 --> 388.54]  When I look back, I see grace
[388.54 --> 395.22]  I see grace
[395.22 --> 398.22]  Grace
[398.22 --> 401.12]  Grace

[408.12 --> 414.18]  Grace that is greater than all my sin
[414.18 --> 415.46]  Grace
[419.80 --> 420.32]  Grace
[426.44 --> 426.92]  Grace

[620.88 --> 622.88]  You will carry me
[622.88 --> 624.88]  To shore
[626.88 --> 628.88]  Good evening
[628.88 --> 630.88]  Probably
[630.88 --> 632.88]  don't need the microphone
[632.88 --> 634.88]  but except for you people online, welcome
[634.88 --> 636.88]  We are so excited
[636.88 --> 638.88]  to gather to worship even if our numbers
[638.88 --> 640.88]  are few
[642.88 --> 644.88]  Tonight is the Ascension Day
[644.88 --> 646.88]  worship service
[646.88 --> 648.88]  Now
[648.88 --> 650.88]  this is
[650.88 --> 652.88]  a
[652.88 --> 654.88]  lessening practice
[654.88 --> 656.88]  in the Christian Reformed world today
[656.88 --> 658.88]  but in the Reformed world more broadly
[658.88 --> 660.88]  Ascension Day has actually been the capstone day
[660.88 --> 662.88]  John Calvin made a pretty compelling argument actually
[662.88 --> 666.88]  that Ascension Day is on par with Resurrection Sunday
[666.88 --> 668.88]  Because without Ascension Day
[668.88 --> 670.88]  Because without Ascension Day
[670.88 --> 672.88]  we don't have Jesus proclaimed as King
[672.88 --> 674.88]  and as Jesus said himself
[674.88 --> 676.88]  without Ascension Day
[676.88 --> 678.88]  unless I go to be with my Father
[678.88 --> 680.88]  the Holy Spirit will not come
[680.88 --> 682.88]  and without the Holy Spirit
[682.88 --> 684.88]  none of us
[684.88 --> 686.88]  would believe
[686.88 --> 688.88]  Without the Holy Spirit our hearts would still be dead
[688.88 --> 690.88]  in sin and so Ascension Day
[690.88 --> 692.88]  actually is
[692.88 --> 694.88]  incredibly important
[694.88 --> 696.88]  in the life of the church
[696.88 --> 698.88]  and as Reformed Christians who proclaim the Lordship of Jesus
[698.88 --> 700.88]  over every square inch
[700.88 --> 702.88]  I'll come back to that later tonight
[702.88 --> 704.88]  Jesus kingship
[704.88 --> 706.88]  matters in our understanding of
[706.88 --> 708.88]  our place in the world
[708.88 --> 710.88]  and so we gather
[710.88 --> 712.88]  for worship
[712.88 --> 714.88]  and so when you go home tonight
[714.88 --> 716.88]  and you tell all your friends how awesome
[716.88 --> 718.88]  it was to be here
[718.88 --> 720.88]  just really rub that in
[720.88 --> 722.88]  and then next year we'll have maybe four or five more
[722.88 --> 723.88]  and then the year after that
[723.88 --> 724.88]  maybe four or five hundred more
[724.88 --> 726.88]  and we'll just move on
[726.88 --> 728.88]  but we do gather to worship
[728.88 --> 730.88]  our ascended King
[730.88 --> 732.88]  and so I'm going to invite you
[732.88 --> 734.88]  in his presence to stand
[734.88 --> 736.88]  we're going to sing
[736.88 --> 738.88]  a bunch of songs
[738.88 --> 740.88]  and we're going to hear from God's Word
[740.88 --> 742.88]  in our service together
[742.88 --> 744.88]  welcome into God's presence
[744.88 --> 746.88]  and we'll receive his greeting
[746.88 --> 747.88]  grace
[747.88 --> 748.88]  mercy
[748.88 --> 750.88]  and peace to you
[750.88 --> 751.88]  from God our Father
[751.88 --> 753.88]  and from the Lord Jesus Christ
[753.88 --> 755.88]  our ascended King
[755.88 --> 758.88]  through the presence and power
[758.88 --> 759.88]  of the Holy Spirit
[760.88 --> 761.88]  Amen
[762.88 --> 764.88]  Turn to those around you
[764.88 --> 767.88]  and welcome them in our combined worship today
[767.88 --> 787.88]  as we worship together this evening
[787.88 --> 792.88]  we're going to roll straight from rejoice the Lord is King into King of Kings
[792.88 --> 794.88]  and I just wanted to give you a heads up
[794.88 --> 795.88]  if you know Spanish
[795.88 --> 800.88]  feel free to join us on the second and third chorus of King of Kings in Spanish
[800.88 --> 802.88]  let's worship together
[802.88 --> 804.88]  we hope together
[806.88 --> 808.88]  Music
[808.88 --> 812.88]  Music

[825.88 --> 829.88]  Music
[829.88 --> 830.38]  Music
[830.38 --> 850.48]  Rejoice! The Lord is King
[850.48 --> 855.40]  Your Lord and King adore
[855.40 --> 861.46]  Rejoice! Give thanks and sing
[861.46 --> 868.16]  And triumph evermore
[868.16 --> 874.30]  Lift up your heart
[874.30 --> 877.78]  Lift up your voice
[877.78 --> 883.02]  Rejoice again I say
[883.02 --> 892.28]  Rejoice! His kingdom cannot fail
[892.28 --> 898.18]  He rules o'er earth and hell
[898.18 --> 903.24]  The keys of death and hell
[903.24 --> 910.50]  To Christ the Lord our gift
[910.50 --> 916.50]  Lift up your heart
[916.50 --> 919.50]  Lift up your voice
[919.50 --> 924.50]  Rejoice again I say
[924.50 --> 933.76]  Rejoice! He sits at God's right hand
[933.76 --> 939.50]  Till all His foes submit
[939.50 --> 943.76]  Bow down at His command
[943.76 --> 951.02]  And fall beneath His feet
[951.02 --> 958.02]  Lift up your heart
[958.02 --> 961.80]  Lift up your voice
[961.80 --> 967.02]  Rejoice again I say
[967.02 --> 974.28]  Rejoice! He is the Lord
[974.28 --> 976.28]  Glorious hope
[976.28 --> 982.28]  For Christ the judge shall come
[982.28 --> 988.28]  To gather all His saints
[988.28 --> 995.54]  To their eternal hope
[995.54 --> 1002.54]  We soon shall hear
[1002.54 --> 1006.32]  The archangel's voice
[1006.32 --> 1009.54]  The trumpet of God
[1009.54 --> 1011.64]  And all sound
[1011.64 --> 1016.80]  Rejoice!
[1016.80 --> 1038.06]  In the darkness we were waiting
[1038.06 --> 1041.70]  Without hope and without light
[1041.70 --> 1043.32]  Till from heaven
[1043.32 --> 1044.88]  Till from heaven you came running
[1044.88 --> 1048.86]  There was mercy in your eyes
[1048.86 --> 1052.08]  To fulfill the law and prophets
[1052.08 --> 1055.74]  To a virgin came the word
[1055.74 --> 1059.00]  From a throne of endless glory
[1059.00 --> 1062.96]  To a cradle in the dirt
[1062.96 --> 1071.70]  Praise the Father
[1071.70 --> 1074.90]  Praise the Son
[1074.90 --> 1078.28]  Praise the Spirit
[1078.28 --> 1081.48]  Three in one
[1081.48 --> 1084.84]  God of glory
[1084.84 --> 1086.98]  Majesty
[1086.98 --> 1092.46]  Praise forever to the King
[1092.46 --> 1095.16]  Of kings
[1095.16 --> 1102.10]  To reveal the kingdom coming
[1102.10 --> 1105.64]  And to reconcile the lost
[1105.64 --> 1108.68]  To redeem the whole creation
[1108.68 --> 1112.26]  You did not despise the cross
[1112.26 --> 1115.54]  For even in your suffering
[1115.54 --> 1119.04]  You sought to the other side
[1119.04 --> 1122.24]  Knowing this was our salvation
[1122.24 --> 1126.68]  Jesus for our sake you died
[1126.68 --> 1132.38]  Glorious Padre Christ
[1132.38 --> 1136.38]  Glorious Padre Christ
[1136.38 --> 1150.08]  Tigal Berry Yeshua
[1150.08 --> 1175.08]  And the morning that you rose, all of heaven held its breath, till that stone was moved for good, for the Lamb had conquered death.
[1175.08 --> 1188.08]  And the dead rose from their tombs, and the angels stood in awe, for the souls of all who had come to the Father are restored.
[1188.08 --> 1201.90]  And the church of Christ was born, and the Spirit lit the flame. Now this gospel truth of old shall not kneel, shall not fade.
[1201.90 --> 1215.64]  By His blood and His name, in His freedom I am free, for the love of Jesus Christ, who has resurrected me.
[1215.64 --> 1227.18]  Praise the Father, praise God's God.
[1227.18 --> 1233.72]  Praise the Spirit, sound and awe.
[1233.72 --> 1240.22]  God of glory, meet His team.
[1240.96 --> 1246.60]  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, and the King of two.
[1247.60 --> 1253.54]  Praise the Father, praise the Son.
[1254.44 --> 1260.52]  Praise the Spirit, three in one.
[1260.52 --> 1266.52]  God of glory, majesty.
[1266.52 --> 1274.76]  Praise forever to the King of kings.
[1274.76 --> 1283.74]  Praise forever to the King of kings.
[1283.74 --> 1291.74]  Let's pray.
[1291.74 --> 1291.76]  Let's pray.
[1294.06 --> 1299.70]  Ascended Christ, intercessor, seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty,
[1300.24 --> 1305.08]  we sing and rejoice in your glory, King of kings, ruler over heaven and earth.
[1305.74 --> 1310.74]  You died in our stead, defeating hell, rose from the dead, and ascended into heaven.
[1310.74 --> 1315.88]  Your standing is above all powers and kings and all of creation.
[1316.66 --> 1318.78]  You are crowned King of all.
[1318.78 --> 1324.78]  Above all powers and above all kings and all of creation.
[1324.78 --> 1326.78]  Let's pray.
[1326.78 --> 1328.78]  Let's pray.
[1328.78 --> 1330.78]  Let's pray.
[1330.78 --> 1332.78]  Let's pray.
[1332.78 --> 1334.78]  Let's pray.
[1334.78 --> 1336.78]  Let's pray.
[1336.78 --> 1338.78]  Let's pray.
[1338.78 --> 1340.78]  Let's pray.
[1340.78 --> 1352.78]  Let's pray.
[1352.78 --> 1370.78]  Let's pray.
[1370.78 --> 1384.42]  Above all kingdoms, above all thrones, above all wonders the world has ever known.
[1385.42 --> 1400.70]  Above all wealth and treasures of the earth, there's no way to measure what you're worth.
[1400.78 --> 1417.08]  Crucified, laid behind the stone, you lived to die, rejected and alone like a rose.
[1417.08 --> 1431.08]  Trampled on the ground, you took the fall and thought of me above all.
[1431.08 --> 1452.52]  Above all powers, above all kings, above all nature and all creative things.
[1452.52 --> 1466.36]  Above all wisdom and all the ways of man, you were here before the world began.
[1466.36 --> 1480.52]  Above all kingdoms, above all thrones, above all wonders the world has ever known.
[1480.52 --> 1496.52]  Above all wealth and treasures of the earth, there's no way to measure what you're worth.
[1496.52 --> 1512.52]  Crucified, laid behind the stone, you lived to die, rejected and alone like a rose.
[1512.52 --> 1528.52]  Trampled on the ground, you taught the fall and thought of me above all.
[1528.52 --> 1533.52]  Crucified, laid behind the stone, you taught the fall and thought of me above all.
[1533.52 --> 1540.52]  You laid behind the stone, you laid behind the stone, you lived to die, rejected and alone like a rose.
[1540.52 --> 1545.52]  Crucified, rejected and alone like a rose.
[1545.52 --> 1560.52]  Trampled on the ground, you took the fall and thought of me above all.
[1560.52 --> 1582.52]  Oh, church of God, look up.
[1582.52 --> 1584.52]  What do you see?
[1584.52 --> 1589.52]  Above all things, what, who sits on the throne of your heart?
[1589.52 --> 1597.52]  Do we sit in cathedrals of our own making, gazing up into the heavens of our own design?
[1597.52 --> 1603.52]  How feeble and meager are they when we have the words of the Creator in our hands.
[1603.52 --> 1608.52]  To what, to whom will we kneel?
[1608.52 --> 1612.52]  What, to whom will we kneel?
[1612.52 --> 1621.52]  Acts 17 says, being then God's offspring, we ought not to think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone,
[1621.52 --> 1625.52]  an image formed by the art and imagination of man.
[1625.52 --> 1631.52]  The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent,
[1631.52 --> 1638.52]  because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed.
[1638.52 --> 1645.52]  And of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead.
[1645.52 --> 1647.52]  Do you not see?
[1647.52 --> 1653.52]  You are trading the riches of Christ's glorious inheritance for a false lord over your life.
[1653.52 --> 1655.52]  Oh, church of God, look up.
[1655.52 --> 1659.52]  Do you see an open, empty heaven awaiting the return of the Savior?
[1659.52 --> 1667.52]  Do you look to the word and find assurance that God will come again to judge the living and the dead, answering creation's groaning?
[1667.52 --> 1672.52]  And in longing response, do you sing with your heart,
[1672.52 --> 1681.52]  Praise the Father, Son, three in one, God of glory, majesty, praise forever to the King of Kings.
[1681.52 --> 1686.52]  If anyone serves me, he must follow me.
[1686.52 --> 1689.52]  And where I am, there will my servant be also.
[1689.52 --> 1694.52]  If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him, Christ said.
[1694.52 --> 1703.52]  O Church of God, kneel in reverence to your King, in confession at his feet, and listen to his voice,
[1703.52 --> 1709.52]  and know him, to know his cause and live under his command.
[1709.52 --> 1714.52]  Set the program together to stand for Now withancy, God will be하세요.
[1714.52 --> 1717.52]  In this 7 decades, and move you to practice hisChr benefHH, a great steadfastness.
[1717.52 --> 1721.52]  In the process of putting His car in place, in academia and conditioning,
[1721.52 --> 1723.52]  In the project number two days, and sit with Randy and Ian personal engagement together.
[1723.52 --> 1726.52]  By theme song of charge, the judge against death след can be hunted for humanity and Department of Allegiance.
[1726.52 --> 1730.52]  Yes, I realize it is related to the Este�th generation,
[1730.52 --> 1732.52]  And there will be aSO Center for Every acompero.
[1732.52 --> 1734.52]  3 mauve Jたちは a Couray in January.
[1734.52 --> 1737.52]  2 phenomenal, and when pasado many times rise and many years lies inside,
[1737.52 --> 1750.06]  O kneel me down again
[1750.06 --> 1754.16]  Here at your feet
[1754.16 --> 1758.48]  Show me how much you love
[1758.48 --> 1761.10]  Humility
[1761.10 --> 1767.12]  O Spirit be the star
[1767.12 --> 1770.56]  That leads me to
[1770.56 --> 1775.50]  The humble heart of love
[1775.50 --> 1779.54]  I see in you
[1779.54 --> 1784.50]  Cause you are the God of the broken
[1784.50 --> 1788.34]  The friend of the weak
[1788.34 --> 1792.62]  You wash the feet of the weary
[1792.62 --> 1796.28]  Embrace the ones in need
[1796.28 --> 1800.60]  I want to be like you Jesus
[1800.60 --> 1803.66]  To have this heart in me
[1803.66 --> 1808.50]  You are the God of the humble
[1808.50 --> 1812.66]  You are the humble King
[1812.66 --> 1817.66]  O kneel me down again
[1817.66 --> 1821.98]  Here at your feet
[1821.98 --> 1826.04]  Show me how much you love
[1826.04 --> 1828.04]  Humility
[1828.04 --> 1833.98]  O Spirit be the star
[1833.98 --> 1838.30]  That leads me to
[1838.30 --> 1842.36]  The humble heart of love
[1842.36 --> 1843.74]  I see in you
[1843.74 --> 1845.74]  I see in you
[1845.74 --> 1846.68]  I see in you
[1846.68 --> 1851.00]  Cause you are the God of the broken
[1851.00 --> 1851.62]  The friend of the broken
[1851.62 --> 1855.32]  The friend of the weak
[1855.32 --> 1859.38]  You wash the feet of the weary
[1859.38 --> 1863.16]  Embrace the ones in need
[1863.16 --> 1867.38]  I want to be like you Jesus
[1867.38 --> 1870.76]  To have this heart in me
[1870.76 --> 1874.76]  You are the God of the humble
[1874.76 --> 1878.76]  You are the humble King
[1878.76 --> 1885.44]  You are the God of the humble
[1885.44 --> 1889.76]  You are the humble King
[1889.76 --> 1902.82]  Who shall ascend to the hill of the Lord
[1902.82 --> 1905.76]  And who shall stand in his holy place
[1905.76 --> 1908.22]  He who has clean hands
[1908.22 --> 1909.18]  And a pure heart
[1909.18 --> 1910.98]  Who does not lift up his soul
[1910.98 --> 1911.88]  To what is false
[1911.88 --> 1913.86]  And does not swear deceitfully
[1913.86 --> 1916.34]  He will receive blessing from the Lord
[1916.34 --> 1917.92]  And righteousness from the God
[1917.92 --> 1918.90]  Of his salvation
[1918.90 --> 1921.14]  Such is the generous gift
[1921.14 --> 1922.44]  Of those who seek him
[1922.44 --> 1925.46]  Who seek the face of the God of Jacob
[1925.46 --> 1945.16]  How I long
[1945.16 --> 1949.38]  To breathe the air of heaven
[1949.38 --> 1952.34]  Where pain is gone
[1952.34 --> 1956.90]  And mercy fills the streets
[1956.90 --> 1959.84]  To look upon
[1959.84 --> 1964.48]  The one who bled to save me
[1964.48 --> 1967.00]  And walk with him
[1967.00 --> 1969.84]  For all eternity
[1969.84 --> 1978.00]  There will be a day
[1978.00 --> 1981.86]  When all will bow before him
[1981.86 --> 1985.02]  There will be a day
[1985.02 --> 1989.02]  When death will be no more
[1989.02 --> 1992.24]  Standing face to face
[1992.24 --> 1997.56]  With he who died and rose again
[1997.56 --> 2003.46]  Holy, holy is the Lord
[2003.46 --> 2016.96]  And every prayer
[2016.96 --> 2020.88]  We prayed in desperation
[2020.88 --> 2024.32]  The songs of faith
[2024.32 --> 2028.80]  We sang through doubt and fear
[2028.80 --> 2030.96]  In the end
[2030.96 --> 2031.96]  In the end
[2031.96 --> 2036.08]  We'll see that it was worth it
[2036.08 --> 2038.18]  When he returns
[2038.18 --> 2043.96]  To wipe away our tears
[2043.96 --> 2047.12]  There will be a day
[2047.12 --> 2049.12]  There will be a day
[2049.12 --> 2053.40]  When all will bow before him
[2053.40 --> 2056.58]  There will be a day
[2056.58 --> 2060.50]  When death will be no more
[2060.50 --> 2063.12]  Standing face to face
[2063.12 --> 2068.28]  With he who died and rose again
[2068.28 --> 2074.28]  Holy, holy is the Lord
[2074.28 --> 2087.44]  And on that day
[2087.44 --> 2089.44]  We'll join the resurrection
[2089.44 --> 2093.44]  And stand beside
[2093.44 --> 2094.60]  Stand beside
[2094.60 --> 2098.60]  The heroes of the faith
[2098.60 --> 2102.60]  With one voice
[2102.60 --> 2106.60]  A thousand generations
[2106.60 --> 2114.60]  Sing, worthy is the Lamb who was slain
[2114.60 --> 2117.76]  Sing, worthy is the Lamb who was slain
[2117.76 --> 2119.76]  And on that day
[2119.76 --> 2120.76]  And on that day
[2120.76 --> 2121.76]  We'll join the resurrection
[2121.76 --> 2123.76]  And stand beside
[2123.76 --> 2125.76]  And stand beside
[2125.76 --> 2127.76]  The heroes of the faith
[2127.76 --> 2130.76]  With one voice
[2130.76 --> 2134.76]  A thousand generations
[2134.76 --> 2141.76]  Sing, worthy is the Lamb who was slain
[2141.76 --> 2144.92]  Sing, worthy is the Lamb who was slain
[2144.92 --> 2148.92]  Forever he shall reign
[2148.92 --> 2156.62]  There will be a day
[2156.62 --> 2160.40]  When all will bow before him
[2160.40 --> 2163.58]  There will be a day
[2163.58 --> 2166.92]  When death will be no more
[2166.92 --> 2170.68]  Standing face to face
[2170.68 --> 2175.84]  With he who died and rose again
[2175.84 --> 2180.84]  Holy, holy is the Lord
[2180.84 --> 2183.84]  So let it be today
[2183.84 --> 2187.72]  We shout the hymn of heaven
[2187.72 --> 2191.34]  With angels and the saints
[2191.34 --> 2194.84]  We raise a mighty roar
[2194.84 --> 2197.84]  Glory to our God
[2197.84 --> 2203.00]  Who gave us life beyond the grave
[2203.00 --> 2210.00]  Holy, holy is the Lord
[2210.00 --> 2217.00]  Holy, holy is the Lord
[2217.00 --> 2224.00]  Holy, holy is the Lord
[2224.00 --> 2234.00]  Why don't you go ahead and have a seat
[2234.00 --> 2244.40]  In just a moment
[2244.40 --> 2249.08]  We're going to open and read together from Ephesians 1
[2249.08 --> 2254.24]  And since you are the kind of people
[2254.24 --> 2257.14]  Who are here on a Thursday night
[2257.14 --> 2260.52]  And interested in what the scriptures have to say
[2260.52 --> 2264.68]  I'm going to challenge you to be the kind of people who open it up
[2264.68 --> 2266.76]  And have it in front of you
[2266.76 --> 2268.28]  Whether in a Bible or on a phone
[2268.28 --> 2269.58]  Or something like that
[2269.58 --> 2270.78]  In your hands
[2270.78 --> 2272.04]  There's a couple Bibles at the back
[2272.24 --> 2273.56]  Josh is grabbing some
[2273.56 --> 2275.40]  So if you want a physical Bible
[2275.40 --> 2277.24]  Raise your hand and Josh will grab one for you
[2277.24 --> 2279.02]  One
[2279.02 --> 2280.80]  Two
[2280.80 --> 2281.52]  Three
[2281.52 --> 2283.56]  Josh, earn your paycheck
[2283.56 --> 2296.70]  The reason specifically that I want you to have it in front of you
[2296.70 --> 2301.36]  Is because we're going to look pretty closely at some of these things here
[2301.36 --> 2303.42]  And I just want you to see it
[2303.42 --> 2306.66]  Because I really think it's majestic
[2306.66 --> 2310.12]  What we're going to see in this text together
[2310.12 --> 2315.16]  I'm going to read from Ephesians 1 verse 15 through 23
[2315.16 --> 2317.48]  Before we do that
[2317.48 --> 2319.10]  Let's pray together
[2319.10 --> 2324.36]  Holy God
[2324.36 --> 2326.36]  Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus Christ
[2326.36 --> 2330.60]  Stir in us your spirit tonight
[2330.60 --> 2333.88]  That we might hear your word
[2333.88 --> 2337.28]  That we might see you, Lord Jesus
[2337.28 --> 2338.16]  More clearly
[2338.16 --> 2341.04]  Not just on these pages
[2341.04 --> 2343.28]  But in our hearts
[2343.28 --> 2345.16]  And in our imaginations
[2345.16 --> 2348.20]  Captivate us tonight
[2348.20 --> 2352.52]  By the glory of being underfoot
[2352.52 --> 2355.88]  May the truth
[2355.88 --> 2356.58]  Lord Jesus
[2356.58 --> 2359.48]  That all things have been placed under your feet
[2359.48 --> 2363.52]  Be so compelling in our midst tonight
[2363.52 --> 2367.48]  We pray this, Jesus, in your holy name
[2367.48 --> 2368.76]  Amen
[2368.76 --> 2374.20]  From Ephesians 1
[2374.20 --> 2375.84]  Starting at verse 15
[2375.84 --> 2379.20]  For this reason
[2379.20 --> 2383.44]  Ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus
[2383.44 --> 2386.24]  And your love for all God's people
[2386.24 --> 2388.86]  I have not stopped giving thanks for you
[2388.86 --> 2391.56]  Remembering you in all my prayers
[2391.56 --> 2396.64]  I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ
[2396.64 --> 2397.92]  The glorious Father
[2397.92 --> 2401.38]  May give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation
[2401.38 --> 2404.36]  So that you may know him better
[2404.36 --> 2408.12]  I pray that the eyes of your heart
[2408.12 --> 2409.00]  May be enlightened
[2409.00 --> 2410.68]  In order that you may know
[2410.68 --> 2413.36]  The hope to which he has called you
[2413.36 --> 2416.48]  The riches of his glorious inheritance
[2416.48 --> 2418.00]  In his holy people
[2418.00 --> 2421.50]  And his incomparably great power
[2421.50 --> 2423.20]  For us who believe
[2423.20 --> 2427.30]  That power is the same as the mighty strength
[2427.30 --> 2429.84]  He exerted when he raised Christ from the dead
[2429.84 --> 2432.26]  And seated him at his right hand
[2432.26 --> 2433.58]  In the heavenly realms
[2433.58 --> 2436.40]  Far above all rule and authority
[2436.40 --> 2437.68]  Power and dominion
[2437.68 --> 2439.74]  And every name that is invoked
[2439.74 --> 2441.86]  Not only in the present age
[2441.86 --> 2443.84]  But also in the one to come
[2443.84 --> 2449.36]  And God placed all things under his feet
[2449.36 --> 2451.58]  And appointed him to be head
[2451.58 --> 2454.82]  Over everything for the church
[2454.82 --> 2456.68]  Which is his body
[2456.68 --> 2458.30]  The fullness of him
[2458.30 --> 2462.02]  Who fills everything in every way
[2462.02 --> 2463.96]  This is the word of the Lord
[2463.96 --> 2470.66]  Now I've titled this message
[2470.66 --> 2473.46]  The Joy of Being Underfoot
[2473.46 --> 2476.72]  Not only because
[2476.72 --> 2479.24]  That seems like a strange image for us
[2479.24 --> 2480.44]  And maybe that is compelling
[2480.44 --> 2484.90]  But because what I hope we will see
[2484.90 --> 2488.40]  Is the majesty and the joy
[2488.40 --> 2489.72]  That you are invited to
[2489.72 --> 2490.64]  As Christians
[2490.64 --> 2492.96]  As we proclaim the truth
[2492.96 --> 2495.52]  Of the ascension of Jesus
[2495.52 --> 2498.94]  Now our theme for tonight
[2498.94 --> 2500.46]  The sort of big idea
[2500.46 --> 2501.82]  That we're going to operate under
[2501.82 --> 2504.12]  Comes out of the whole text of course
[2504.12 --> 2505.80]  But really and succinctly
[2505.80 --> 2509.12]  It is stated in the last two verses
[2509.12 --> 2510.84]  That we read
[2510.84 --> 2515.08]  God placed all things under his feet
[2515.08 --> 2517.00]  And appointed him to be head
[2517.00 --> 2518.86]  Over everything for the church
[2518.86 --> 2520.26]  Which is his body
[2520.26 --> 2521.68]  The fullness of him
[2521.68 --> 2525.38]  Who fills everything in every way
[2525.38 --> 2530.70]  Now Paul begins this section of scripture
[2530.70 --> 2533.56]  By telling us that he is praying
[2533.56 --> 2536.66]  For the church that he is writing to
[2536.66 --> 2538.04]  The letter of Ephesians
[2538.04 --> 2540.10]  Is written to the church in Ephesus
[2540.10 --> 2542.80]  Ephesus is a coastal city
[2542.80 --> 2545.02]  In what is modern day Turkey
[2545.02 --> 2546.92]  On the western side of Turkey
[2546.92 --> 2548.80]  Leaning into the Aegean Sea
[2548.80 --> 2550.38]  And he prays
[2550.38 --> 2553.22]  I have not stopped giving thanks for you
[2553.22 --> 2556.14]  Remembering you in all my prayers
[2556.14 --> 2559.06]  He thanks God for them
[2559.06 --> 2561.62]  And for the stories that he has heard about them
[2561.62 --> 2563.22]  Since planting that church
[2563.22 --> 2564.58]  And in his other journeys
[2564.58 --> 2565.54]  Throughout that region
[2565.54 --> 2567.82]  He wants to encourage them
[2567.82 --> 2570.42]  And so he prays for their life
[2570.42 --> 2571.68]  And for their faith
[2571.68 --> 2575.72]  He prays because he wants this fledgling church
[2575.72 --> 2577.26]  This young church
[2577.26 --> 2579.78]  To know God better
[2579.78 --> 2580.54]  Right?
[2580.64 --> 2581.36]  Verse 17
[2581.36 --> 2582.42]  He says
[2582.42 --> 2586.64]  I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ
[2586.64 --> 2587.70]  The glorious Father
[2587.70 --> 2589.42]  May give you the spirit of wisdom
[2589.42 --> 2590.84]  And of revelation
[2590.84 --> 2595.74]  So that you may know him better
[2595.74 --> 2596.98]  Right?
[2596.98 --> 2598.22]  What he wants for them
[2598.22 --> 2600.98]  Is to mature in their faith
[2600.98 --> 2602.48]  Right?
[2602.50 --> 2603.78]  He wants for them to develop
[2603.78 --> 2605.62]  As Christians
[2605.62 --> 2608.46]  And so he starts in verse 15
[2608.46 --> 2609.04]  Right?
[2609.12 --> 2611.00]  He knows that they are Christians
[2611.00 --> 2613.34]  He's heard about their amazing love
[2613.34 --> 2614.30]  For each other
[2614.30 --> 2615.98]  And he gives thanks to God for them
[2615.98 --> 2617.90]  But he doesn't want them to stop there
[2617.90 --> 2620.38]  He wants them to keep on growing
[2620.38 --> 2621.88]  To keep on developing
[2621.88 --> 2625.02]  To become more of who they already are
[2625.02 --> 2626.44]  Right?
[2626.46 --> 2628.54]  It's not just enough to become
[2628.54 --> 2629.88]  You have to be
[2629.88 --> 2631.28]  Right?
[2631.30 --> 2633.20]  And he wants them to grow
[2633.20 --> 2634.72]  In the grace and knowledge
[2634.72 --> 2635.78]  Of Jesus
[2635.78 --> 2637.12]  And of God
[2637.12 --> 2638.42]  Right?
[2638.42 --> 2640.32]  Paul knows that in the Bible
[2640.32 --> 2642.64]  You read about this over and over and over
[2642.64 --> 2644.42]  Idleness of faith
[2644.42 --> 2646.68]  Leads to faith in idols
[2646.68 --> 2649.26]  I'm going to say that again
[2649.26 --> 2650.60]  Idleness of faith
[2650.60 --> 2653.18]  Leads to a faith in idols
[2653.18 --> 2654.82]  And we don't want that
[2654.82 --> 2656.40]  Not then
[2656.40 --> 2657.78]  And not now
[2657.78 --> 2660.82]  So what Paul wants
[2660.82 --> 2663.20]  Is for us to grow
[2663.20 --> 2664.86]  To not be idle
[2664.86 --> 2666.42]  In our faith
[2666.42 --> 2668.08]  And so we start
[2668.08 --> 2670.08]  With that focus
[2670.08 --> 2672.24]  God placed all things
[2672.24 --> 2673.10]  Under his feet
[2673.10 --> 2673.96]  And appointed him
[2673.96 --> 2674.82]  To be head
[2674.82 --> 2676.14]  Over everything
[2676.14 --> 2677.10]  For the church
[2677.10 --> 2678.30]  Which is his body
[2678.30 --> 2679.50]  The fullness of him
[2679.50 --> 2680.84]  Who fills everything
[2680.84 --> 2682.20]  In every way
[2682.20 --> 2684.12]  This line
[2684.12 --> 2684.80]  Is the
[2684.80 --> 2685.76]  The climax
[2685.76 --> 2686.90]  The
[2686.90 --> 2687.90]  The climax
[2687.90 --> 2688.92]  Of the description
[2688.92 --> 2690.60]  Of God's power
[2690.60 --> 2691.32]  At work
[2691.32 --> 2692.66]  Through the gospel
[2692.66 --> 2694.48]  The power of God
[2694.48 --> 2695.82]  That raised Christ
[2695.82 --> 2696.74]  The power of God
[2696.74 --> 2697.72]  That seated him
[2697.72 --> 2698.70]  At the right hand
[2698.70 --> 2699.20]  Of the Father
[2699.20 --> 2700.06]  And the power
[2700.06 --> 2701.26]  By which God
[2701.26 --> 2702.00]  Has now placed
[2702.00 --> 2703.14]  All things
[2703.14 --> 2705.32]  Under his feet
[2705.32 --> 2708.42]  And it's the same power
[2708.42 --> 2709.20]  That has done
[2709.20 --> 2710.22]  All of those things
[2710.22 --> 2712.62]  That Paul wants us
[2712.62 --> 2713.68]  To know
[2713.68 --> 2715.84]  That God is giving us
[2715.84 --> 2716.80]  Access to
[2716.80 --> 2717.74]  And then to live
[2717.74 --> 2718.66]  In the confidence
[2718.66 --> 2719.56]  Of
[2719.56 --> 2720.52]  Right
[2720.52 --> 2721.40]  Paul says
[2721.40 --> 2723.20]  I pray
[2723.20 --> 2725.52]  That the eyes
[2725.52 --> 2726.44]  Of your heart
[2726.44 --> 2727.78]  May be enlightened
[2727.78 --> 2730.08]  I pray
[2730.08 --> 2730.90]  That the eyes
[2730.90 --> 2732.02]  Of your heart
[2732.02 --> 2732.56]  May be
[2732.56 --> 2733.56]  Enlightened
[2733.56 --> 2734.40]  He prays
[2734.40 --> 2735.68]  That we would not have
[2735.68 --> 2736.68]  Eyes
[2736.68 --> 2737.82]  For physical
[2737.82 --> 2738.64]  Things
[2738.64 --> 2739.76]  Of this world
[2739.76 --> 2740.60]  That we wouldn't
[2740.60 --> 2741.22]  Look to the
[2741.22 --> 2742.54]  Created things
[2742.54 --> 2743.52]  Of this world
[2743.52 --> 2744.28]  For hope
[2744.28 --> 2745.20]  Or for happiness
[2745.20 --> 2746.12]  Or for purpose
[2746.12 --> 2747.62]  But that we would
[2747.62 --> 2748.58]  As we read elsewhere
[2748.58 --> 2749.74]  Walk by faith
[2749.74 --> 2751.12]  And not by sight
[2751.12 --> 2752.08]  Right
[2752.08 --> 2752.74]  He prays
[2752.74 --> 2753.66]  For the eyes
[2753.66 --> 2754.74]  Of the heart
[2754.74 --> 2755.82]  That you
[2755.82 --> 2756.80]  Would be able
[2756.80 --> 2758.10]  To see the truth
[2758.10 --> 2759.00]  That you would be able
[2759.00 --> 2760.24]  To see behind
[2760.24 --> 2761.14]  The veil
[2761.14 --> 2762.86]  What Paul wants
[2762.86 --> 2763.32]  For us
[2763.32 --> 2764.34]  In this letter
[2764.34 --> 2765.24]  And for the church
[2765.24 --> 2765.78]  In Ephesus
[2765.78 --> 2766.86]  Is to sort of
[2766.86 --> 2767.96]  Pull back the curtain
[2767.96 --> 2769.14]  And to give them
[2769.14 --> 2770.50]  What's called
[2770.50 --> 2770.94]  In theology
[2770.94 --> 2772.92]  A theophanic vision
[2772.92 --> 2773.86]  Right
[2773.86 --> 2774.42]  Theos
[2774.42 --> 2775.20]  From the Greek word
[2775.20 --> 2775.78]  For God
[2775.78 --> 2777.06]  And phanos
[2777.06 --> 2777.74]  From the Greek word
[2777.74 --> 2778.20]  For light
[2778.20 --> 2778.98]  And to reveal
[2778.98 --> 2779.74]  Right
[2779.74 --> 2780.70]  Theophanic vision
[2780.70 --> 2781.38]  What Paul wants
[2781.38 --> 2781.78]  Is for you
[2781.78 --> 2782.62]  To see God
[2782.62 --> 2784.88]  To see God
[2784.88 --> 2785.44]  At work
[2785.44 --> 2786.42]  In the world
[2786.42 --> 2787.92]  Right
[2787.92 --> 2789.32]  Two thousand years ago
[2789.32 --> 2790.72]  And still today
[2790.72 --> 2792.92]  To see God
[2792.92 --> 2795.66]  Open the eyes
[2795.66 --> 2796.56]  Of my heart
[2796.56 --> 2796.86]  Lord
[2796.86 --> 2799.24]  I want to see Jesus
[2799.24 --> 2800.28]  Right
[2800.28 --> 2801.06]  That's Paul's prayer
[2801.06 --> 2801.98]  For the Ephesians
[2801.98 --> 2803.48]  That's our prayer
[2803.48 --> 2804.18]  Together
[2804.18 --> 2804.92]  Tonight
[2804.92 --> 2807.60]  Because
[2807.60 --> 2811.16]  I don't know about you
[2811.16 --> 2812.28]  In fact
[2812.28 --> 2812.90]  That's not true
[2812.90 --> 2813.42]  I do know
[2813.42 --> 2814.04]  About you
[2814.04 --> 2815.18]  Right
[2815.18 --> 2815.66]  It's easy
[2815.66 --> 2816.38]  To be distracted
[2816.38 --> 2817.86]  By the faded glories
[2817.86 --> 2818.52]  Of this world
[2818.52 --> 2819.54]  It's easy
[2819.54 --> 2820.68]  To be overcome
[2820.68 --> 2822.20]  By the ultimately
[2822.20 --> 2823.40]  Inadequate lusts
[2823.40 --> 2824.72]  Of this secular age
[2824.72 --> 2825.64]  That still captivate
[2825.64 --> 2826.32]  Our hearts
[2826.32 --> 2826.92]  But Jesus
[2826.92 --> 2827.66]  Wants more
[2827.66 --> 2828.60]  For us
[2828.60 --> 2829.96]  The pull
[2829.96 --> 2831.02]  Of materialism
[2831.02 --> 2832.38]  The vain glory
[2832.38 --> 2833.36]  Of human pride
[2833.36 --> 2834.30]  The pressures
[2834.30 --> 2835.08]  Of the imminent
[2835.08 --> 2835.92]  And the tyranny
[2835.92 --> 2836.78]  Of the urgent
[2836.78 --> 2837.58]  All of these
[2837.58 --> 2840.02]  Are just so easily
[2840.02 --> 2841.22]  Overwhelming
[2841.22 --> 2842.50]  Distractions
[2842.50 --> 2844.66]  Of our affections
[2844.66 --> 2846.74]  For Jesus
[2846.74 --> 2848.62]  Instead
[2848.62 --> 2850.38]  Instead
[2850.38 --> 2851.44]  We want the eyes
[2851.44 --> 2852.10]  Of our hearts
[2852.10 --> 2853.00]  So fixed
[2853.00 --> 2854.04]  On Jesus
[2854.04 --> 2854.62]  That we would
[2854.62 --> 2855.66]  Run the race
[2855.66 --> 2856.34]  That's marked out
[2856.34 --> 2856.90]  For us
[2856.90 --> 2857.62]  Right
[2857.62 --> 2858.14]  We want to make
[2858.14 --> 2859.00]  Jesus more
[2859.00 --> 2860.38]  And more beautiful
[2860.38 --> 2861.22]  In the minds
[2861.22 --> 2862.46]  Of all believers
[2862.46 --> 2863.52]  So that all those
[2863.52 --> 2864.12]  Other things
[2864.12 --> 2865.08]  Might fade
[2865.08 --> 2865.88]  To the back
[2865.88 --> 2867.70]  When our imaginations
[2867.70 --> 2868.86]  Are captivated
[2868.86 --> 2869.80]  By God
[2869.80 --> 2870.40]  Who is able
[2870.40 --> 2871.44]  To do even more
[2871.44 --> 2872.16]  Than we can ask
[2872.16 --> 2872.90]  Or imagine
[2872.90 --> 2873.98]  Our hearts
[2873.98 --> 2874.66]  Can endure
[2874.66 --> 2876.12]  Spiritual storms
[2876.12 --> 2877.50]  And physical trials
[2877.50 --> 2878.98]  Even if your body
[2878.98 --> 2880.40]  Does not endure
[2880.40 --> 2882.44]  Right
[2882.44 --> 2883.06]  When the eyes
[2883.06 --> 2883.72]  Of your heart
[2883.72 --> 2884.52]  Are focused
[2884.52 --> 2885.52]  On the hope
[2885.52 --> 2886.18]  Of God
[2886.18 --> 2887.80]  And the riches
[2887.80 --> 2888.50]  Of God
[2888.50 --> 2889.26]  And the power
[2889.26 --> 2889.76]  Of God
[2889.76 --> 2890.96]  Displayed in Jesus
[2890.96 --> 2892.04]  You can stand
[2892.04 --> 2893.62]  Against the devil's schemes
[2893.62 --> 2894.68]  You can stand
[2894.68 --> 2895.48]  Against the rulers
[2895.48 --> 2896.28]  And the powers
[2896.28 --> 2897.18]  And the authorities
[2897.18 --> 2898.52]  You can stand
[2898.52 --> 2899.36]  Against the spiritual
[2899.36 --> 2900.84]  Forces of evil
[2900.84 --> 2901.84]  That's what Paul
[2901.84 --> 2903.04]  Is praying for you
[2903.04 --> 2905.54]  I pray that the eyes
[2905.54 --> 2906.14]  Of your heart
[2906.14 --> 2907.52]  May be enlightened
[2907.52 --> 2911.06]  Paul also knows
[2911.06 --> 2913.00]  That this way
[2913.00 --> 2913.92]  Of seeing
[2913.92 --> 2915.34]  And being
[2915.34 --> 2916.58]  In the world
[2916.58 --> 2918.20]  Is a consequence
[2918.20 --> 2919.42]  Of the gift
[2919.42 --> 2920.00]  Of grace
[2920.00 --> 2920.84]  Is a consequence
[2920.84 --> 2921.62]  Of the work
[2921.62 --> 2922.30]  And presence
[2922.30 --> 2923.54]  Of the Holy Spirit
[2923.54 --> 2924.20]  It says
[2924.20 --> 2925.90]  May be enlightened
[2925.90 --> 2927.50]  This isn't something
[2927.50 --> 2928.62]  That you do
[2928.62 --> 2929.94]  It's something you pray
[2929.94 --> 2931.84]  This isn't something
[2931.84 --> 2932.48]  You achieve
[2932.48 --> 2933.20]  Through discipline
[2933.20 --> 2934.12]  And hard work
[2934.12 --> 2934.76]  This is something
[2934.76 --> 2935.54]  That you receive
[2935.54 --> 2936.18]  By grace
[2936.18 --> 2937.42]  And by regeneration
[2937.42 --> 2940.18]  One of the scholars
[2940.18 --> 2942.06]  That I have read
[2942.06 --> 2943.32]  Actually preferred
[2943.32 --> 2944.06]  To translate
[2944.06 --> 2944.74]  This sentence
[2944.74 --> 2945.42]  From Greek
[2945.42 --> 2946.14]  In this way
[2946.14 --> 2946.94]  They translate it
[2946.94 --> 2948.66]  As I pray
[2948.66 --> 2950.32]  Since the eyes
[2950.32 --> 2951.00]  Of your heart
[2951.00 --> 2952.04]  Have been enlightened
[2952.04 --> 2954.48]  Do you hear the difference?
[2955.44 --> 2956.82]  You start from the place
[2956.82 --> 2957.94]  Already enlightened
[2957.94 --> 2959.18]  That since you start
[2959.18 --> 2959.72]  From the place
[2959.72 --> 2960.18]  Of your heart
[2960.18 --> 2961.48]  Already being enlightened
[2961.48 --> 2962.98]  I pray that you may know
[2962.98 --> 2963.98]  The hope of his calling
[2963.98 --> 2965.16]  The riches of his inheritance
[2965.16 --> 2966.14]  In the church
[2966.14 --> 2967.22]  And his surpassingly
[2967.22 --> 2968.68]  Magnificent power
[2968.68 --> 2971.20]  It's all hinged
[2971.20 --> 2972.24]  On what has already
[2972.24 --> 2973.16]  Happened
[2973.16 --> 2974.44]  By the gospel
[2974.44 --> 2975.50]  Being applied
[2975.50 --> 2976.48]  To you
[2976.48 --> 2977.52]  Right?
[2977.56 --> 2978.52]  The gospel of Jesus
[2978.52 --> 2979.06]  That says
[2979.06 --> 2979.88]  He lived the life
[2979.88 --> 2980.58]  I should have lived
[2980.58 --> 2981.64]  And died the death
[2981.64 --> 2982.54]  That I deserve
[2982.54 --> 2983.56]  The gospel of Jesus
[2983.56 --> 2984.30]  That says
[2984.30 --> 2985.52]  He died on the cross
[2985.52 --> 2986.34]  For the sins
[2986.34 --> 2987.58]  Of all who believed
[2987.58 --> 2988.84]  And who have been called
[2988.84 --> 2989.96]  According to his purpose
[2989.96 --> 2990.96]  The gospel of Jesus
[2990.96 --> 2991.38]  That says
[2991.38 --> 2992.38]  Three days later
[2992.38 --> 2993.60]  God raised him
[2993.60 --> 2994.30]  From the dead
[2994.30 --> 2995.24]  The gospel of Jesus
[2995.24 --> 2995.58]  That said
[2995.58 --> 2996.88]  Forty days after that
[2996.88 --> 2997.60]  He ascended
[2997.60 --> 2998.42]  To heaven
[2998.42 --> 2999.10]  And is seated
[2999.10 --> 2999.98]  At the right hand
[2999.98 --> 3001.14]  Of God the Father
[3001.14 --> 3003.04]  This gospel is yours
[3003.04 --> 3003.82]  By grace
[3003.82 --> 3004.74]  Through faith
[3004.74 --> 3006.02]  And when the gospel
[3006.02 --> 3006.66]  Of Jesus
[3006.66 --> 3008.02]  Is the power of God
[3008.02 --> 3009.12]  Unto salvation
[3009.12 --> 3010.46]  Not only for others
[3010.46 --> 3011.58]  But also for you
[3011.58 --> 3012.68]  In your heart
[3012.68 --> 3013.96]  This then
[3013.96 --> 3015.48]  What Paul talks about here
[3015.48 --> 3016.42]  Becomes your
[3016.42 --> 3018.56]  New creation reality
[3018.56 --> 3019.34]  That is to say
[3019.34 --> 3021.84]  You already have hope
[3021.84 --> 3024.70]  You already have riches
[3024.70 --> 3027.36]  You already have power
[3027.36 --> 3029.74]  And this is where
[3029.74 --> 3030.52]  We're going to live
[3030.52 --> 3031.74]  And dig
[3031.74 --> 3032.46]  Hope
[3032.46 --> 3033.30]  Riches
[3033.30 --> 3034.16]  Power
[3034.16 --> 3036.70]  Now think about this
[3036.70 --> 3037.54]  As we come into here
[3037.54 --> 3037.76]  Right
[3037.76 --> 3039.24]  Imagine with a
[3039.24 --> 3040.42]  With a Holy Spirit
[3040.42 --> 3041.70]  Imagination for just a moment
[3041.70 --> 3043.38]  How would your life
[3043.38 --> 3044.06]  Change
[3044.06 --> 3045.10]  Right
[3045.10 --> 3046.16]  If you took this truth
[3046.16 --> 3047.12]  That you already have hope
[3047.12 --> 3048.08]  You already have riches
[3048.08 --> 3049.02]  You already have power
[3049.02 --> 3050.72]  And planted it deep
[3050.72 --> 3051.58]  Into the core
[3051.58 --> 3052.50]  Of who you are
[3052.50 --> 3054.40]  Right
[3054.40 --> 3054.84]  Because you see
[3054.84 --> 3055.66]  Our struggle
[3055.66 --> 3057.32]  Isn't that we need hope
[3057.32 --> 3058.36]  Or that we need
[3058.36 --> 3059.06]  Heavenly riches
[3059.06 --> 3059.74]  Or that we need
[3059.74 --> 3060.40]  Heavenly power
[3060.40 --> 3061.16]  Our struggle
[3061.16 --> 3062.02]  Is that we need
[3062.02 --> 3063.18]  The eyes to see it
[3063.18 --> 3065.42]  Because we already have it
[3065.42 --> 3068.00]  You already have it
[3068.00 --> 3068.72]  And so now
[3068.72 --> 3070.16]  We have to put it to work
[3070.16 --> 3071.88]  Right
[3071.88 --> 3072.46]  And so maybe
[3072.46 --> 3073.40]  You're walking
[3073.40 --> 3074.08]  Through the valley
[3074.08 --> 3075.04]  Of the shadow of death
[3075.04 --> 3077.48]  Maybe it's a dark night
[3077.48 --> 3078.02]  Of the soul
[3078.02 --> 3079.12]  For wherever you are
[3079.12 --> 3079.68]  At right now
[3079.68 --> 3080.52]  Maybe it's a season
[3080.52 --> 3081.02]  Of doubt
[3081.02 --> 3082.14]  Or unbelief
[3082.14 --> 3083.34]  But hope
[3083.34 --> 3084.58]  Hope
[3084.58 --> 3085.98]  Granted to you by God
[3085.98 --> 3086.98]  Hope means
[3086.98 --> 3088.12]  That you can walk
[3088.12 --> 3088.92]  Through the valley
[3088.92 --> 3090.76]  With your head held high
[3090.76 --> 3091.44]  You can walk
[3091.44 --> 3092.12]  Through the valley
[3092.12 --> 3093.10]  With your eyes
[3093.10 --> 3094.26]  Wide open
[3094.26 --> 3095.32]  Hope means
[3095.32 --> 3095.96]  You don't have to be
[3095.96 --> 3097.54]  Afraid of the dark
[3097.54 --> 3098.64]  Hope means
[3098.64 --> 3099.52]  That whatever doubt
[3099.52 --> 3100.88]  You are experiencing
[3100.88 --> 3102.46]  Is boxed in
[3102.46 --> 3103.78]  It is limited
[3103.78 --> 3105.66]  Notice
[3105.66 --> 3106.98]  You might still be
[3106.98 --> 3107.56]  In the valley
[3107.56 --> 3109.12]  You might still be
[3109.12 --> 3109.72]  In the dark night
[3109.72 --> 3110.14]  Of the soul
[3110.14 --> 3111.10]  You might still be
[3111.10 --> 3112.60]  Having those doubts
[3112.60 --> 3113.22]  Right
[3113.22 --> 3114.14]  Your circumstances
[3114.14 --> 3114.98]  Don't change
[3114.98 --> 3116.32]  But hope changes
[3116.32 --> 3117.28]  The way you see
[3117.28 --> 3118.36]  Your circumstances
[3118.36 --> 3120.76]  Right
[3120.76 --> 3121.28]  The meaning
[3121.28 --> 3122.48]  Of whatever place
[3122.48 --> 3123.24]  You are at
[3123.24 --> 3123.92]  Right now
[3123.92 --> 3125.44]  The meaning you make
[3125.44 --> 3125.96]  Of that
[3125.96 --> 3127.10]  Isn't despair
[3127.10 --> 3128.26]  Or desperation
[3128.26 --> 3129.10]  But instead
[3129.10 --> 3130.08]  Devotion
[3130.08 --> 3131.26]  And dedication
[3131.26 --> 3132.54]  To seeing God's
[3132.54 --> 3133.34]  Will through
[3133.34 --> 3135.44]  That's the power
[3135.44 --> 3136.14]  Of hope
[3136.14 --> 3137.30]  Right
[3137.30 --> 3138.12]  That's the effect
[3138.12 --> 3138.84]  Of God
[3138.84 --> 3140.80]  Placing everything
[3140.80 --> 3142.28]  Under Jesus'
[3143.04 --> 3143.32]  Feet
[3143.32 --> 3146.04]  Hope
[3146.04 --> 3148.10]  And the riches
[3148.10 --> 3149.18]  Of his glorious
[3149.18 --> 3149.92]  Inheritance
[3149.92 --> 3150.62]  In fact the same
[3150.62 --> 3151.90]  Pattern and truth
[3151.90 --> 3153.46]  Emerges from both
[3153.46 --> 3154.34]  The riches of his
[3154.34 --> 3155.26]  Glorious inheritance
[3155.26 --> 3157.60]  In his holy people
[3157.60 --> 3159.60]  Paul says
[3159.60 --> 3161.16]  You already have
[3161.16 --> 3162.02]  The riches
[3162.02 --> 3163.00]  You've already been
[3163.00 --> 3163.68]  Given the riches
[3163.68 --> 3164.80]  Of his inheritance
[3164.80 --> 3165.64]  In the church
[3165.64 --> 3167.70]  This is what
[3167.70 --> 3168.32]  I want you to see
[3168.32 --> 3168.72]  So if you have
[3168.72 --> 3169.08]  Your bible
[3169.08 --> 3170.26]  Look closely
[3170.26 --> 3170.70]  Here
[3170.70 --> 3172.90]  Look closely
[3172.90 --> 3174.62]  At chapter 1
[3174.62 --> 3175.80]  Verse 3
[3175.80 --> 3177.60]  Chapter 1
[3177.60 --> 3178.20]  Verse 3
[3178.20 --> 3179.12]  Paul says
[3179.12 --> 3180.52]  Praise be to God
[3180.52 --> 3181.44]  To the God
[3181.44 --> 3181.96]  And Father
[3181.96 --> 3182.62]  Of our Lord
[3182.62 --> 3183.30]  Jesus Christ
[3183.30 --> 3184.40]  Who has blessed us
[3184.40 --> 3185.68]  In the heavenly realms
[3185.68 --> 3187.36]  With every spiritual blessing
[3187.36 --> 3189.48]  In Christ
[3189.48 --> 3194.04]  You have every spiritual blessing
[3194.04 --> 3195.84]  That's how Paul starts the letter
[3195.84 --> 3197.34]  You already have them
[3197.34 --> 3198.56]  They're in the heavenly realms
[3198.56 --> 3200.32]  But you have them
[3200.32 --> 3202.76]  Now look at verse 20
[3202.76 --> 3203.36]  Which we read
[3203.36 --> 3206.16]  The power is like
[3206.16 --> 3207.54]  The working of his mighty strength
[3207.54 --> 3208.68]  Which he
[3208.68 --> 3209.40]  Or that he
[3209.40 --> 3210.24]  Exerted
[3210.24 --> 3211.60]  When he raised Christ
[3211.60 --> 3212.20]  From the dead
[3212.20 --> 3213.42]  And seated him
[3213.42 --> 3215.34]  At his right hand
[3215.34 --> 3215.74]  Where?
[3216.88 --> 3219.30]  In the heavenly realms
[3219.30 --> 3223.16]  What's the spiritual blessing
[3223.16 --> 3224.40]  That you've already been given
[3224.40 --> 3225.28]  In the heavenly realms?
[3227.72 --> 3229.16]  The one who is seated
[3229.16 --> 3230.96]  In the heavenly realms
[3230.96 --> 3232.88]  Right?
[3232.94 --> 3233.68]  Christ himself
[3233.68 --> 3235.80]  Is your blessing
[3235.80 --> 3236.56]  Right?
[3236.60 --> 3237.16]  Think about that
[3237.16 --> 3238.22]  It's not a promise
[3238.22 --> 3239.30]  Of a possession
[3239.30 --> 3241.24]  It's a promise
[3241.24 --> 3241.94]  Of a person
[3241.94 --> 3243.74]  Right?
[3243.76 --> 3245.40]  It's not a material blessing
[3245.40 --> 3247.16]  But it's a man
[3247.16 --> 3248.48]  Right?
[3248.52 --> 3249.00]  Your riches
[3249.00 --> 3250.12]  Aren't things
[3250.12 --> 3250.84]  The riches
[3250.84 --> 3251.88]  That you have been promised
[3251.88 --> 3252.46]  And given
[3252.46 --> 3254.24]  Is God himself
[3254.24 --> 3257.06]  Okay now hold that
[3257.06 --> 3257.72]  And check that out
[3257.72 --> 3258.48]  Paul says
[3258.48 --> 3259.06]  I pray
[3259.06 --> 3259.70]  That the eyes
[3259.70 --> 3260.20]  Of your heart
[3260.20 --> 3260.94]  May be enlightened
[3260.94 --> 3262.14]  In order that you may know
[3262.14 --> 3263.12]  The riches
[3263.12 --> 3264.22]  Of his glorious
[3264.22 --> 3265.18]  Inheritance
[3265.18 --> 3267.36]  In the saints
[3267.36 --> 3269.00]  Or in his
[3269.00 --> 3270.96]  Holy people
[3270.96 --> 3274.12]  The riches
[3274.12 --> 3274.88]  Are Christ
[3274.88 --> 3277.06]  But there's also more
[3277.06 --> 3279.30]  Look at verse 13
[3279.30 --> 3280.86]  Verse 13
[3280.86 --> 3281.70]  We didn't read it
[3281.70 --> 3283.56]  You were also
[3283.56 --> 3285.44]  Included in Christ
[3285.44 --> 3286.10]  When you heard
[3286.10 --> 3286.94]  The word of truth
[3286.94 --> 3287.62]  The gospel
[3287.62 --> 3290.12]  Of your salvation
[3290.12 --> 3292.22]  Right?
[3292.30 --> 3293.08]  When you believed
[3293.08 --> 3293.82]  You were marked
[3293.82 --> 3294.40]  In him
[3294.40 --> 3295.22]  With a seal
[3295.22 --> 3296.18]  The promised
[3296.18 --> 3297.50]  Holy Spirit
[3297.50 --> 3298.94]  Who is a deposit
[3298.94 --> 3300.26]  Guaranteeing our
[3300.26 --> 3301.22]  Inheritance
[3301.22 --> 3302.12]  There's that word again
[3302.12 --> 3303.24]  Until the redemption
[3303.24 --> 3303.88]  Of those
[3303.88 --> 3305.26]  Who are God's possession
[3305.26 --> 3306.34]  To the praise
[3306.34 --> 3307.70]  Of his glory
[3307.70 --> 3309.16]  Being in Christ
[3309.16 --> 3310.32]  Is the spiritual
[3310.32 --> 3311.08]  Blessing
[3311.08 --> 3312.80]  And being in him
[3312.80 --> 3312.82]  And being in him
[3312.82 --> 3314.24]  Means that the Holy Spirit
[3314.24 --> 3315.14]  The great comforter
[3315.14 --> 3316.50]  The breath of God
[3316.50 --> 3317.06]  Breathing
[3317.06 --> 3317.50]  Holy
[3317.50 --> 3318.30]  Sanctified
[3318.30 --> 3319.58]  Powerful life
[3319.58 --> 3320.48]  Into you
[3320.48 --> 3321.48]  Has come
[3321.48 --> 3323.00]  Right?
[3323.04 --> 3323.92]  The riches of his
[3323.92 --> 3324.92]  Glorious inheritance
[3324.92 --> 3325.58]  In Jesus
[3325.58 --> 3326.80]  And the Spirit
[3326.80 --> 3329.16]  The riches
[3329.16 --> 3330.18]  Are his
[3330.18 --> 3331.60]  Glorious inheritance
[3331.60 --> 3332.68]  That is Jesus
[3332.68 --> 3333.86]  And the Spirit
[3333.86 --> 3335.22]  That's all you need
[3335.22 --> 3335.74]  For life
[3335.74 --> 3336.70]  And faith
[3336.70 --> 3337.92]  Right?
[3337.96 --> 3338.60]  And when you have
[3338.60 --> 3339.36]  Jesus
[3339.36 --> 3340.90]  And the Spirit
[3340.90 --> 3342.80]  You have every
[3342.80 --> 3344.66]  Spiritual blessing
[3344.66 --> 3346.26]  All I have is Christ
[3346.26 --> 3347.32]  We will sing
[3347.32 --> 3347.86]  In a moment
[3347.86 --> 3349.22]  And that makes me
[3349.22 --> 3349.94]  The richest
[3349.94 --> 3351.06]  Of men
[3351.06 --> 3353.46]  And so now
[3353.46 --> 3355.38]  Don't confuse
[3355.38 --> 3356.60]  The promised
[3356.60 --> 3357.48]  Blessing
[3357.48 --> 3359.40]  With the promise
[3359.40 --> 3360.32]  To be blessed
[3360.32 --> 3362.02]  Right?
[3362.02 --> 3362.92]  Because in the world today
[3362.92 --> 3364.02]  That gets confused
[3364.02 --> 3365.18]  Far too often
[3365.18 --> 3366.08]  Right?
[3366.08 --> 3366.96]  This isn't about
[3366.96 --> 3367.78]  Prosperity
[3367.78 --> 3368.76]  Here and now
[3368.76 --> 3369.28]  And let me be
[3369.28 --> 3369.76]  Really honest
[3369.76 --> 3370.92]  Most of us here
[3370.92 --> 3371.78]  Right?
[3371.84 --> 3372.74]  Are incredibly
[3372.74 --> 3373.56]  Prosperous
[3373.56 --> 3374.60]  In this life
[3374.60 --> 3375.34]  From a material
[3375.34 --> 3375.94]  Standpoint
[3375.94 --> 3379.66]  But maybe
[3379.66 --> 3382.00]  What's being exposed
[3382.00 --> 3383.06]  Is a spiritual
[3383.06 --> 3383.92]  Bankruptcy
[3383.92 --> 3385.76]  Right?
[3385.80 --> 3386.54]  When your treasure
[3386.54 --> 3387.60]  Is treasure
[3387.60 --> 3389.62]  Your heart
[3389.62 --> 3390.48]  Is weighed down
[3390.48 --> 3391.10]  By gold
[3391.10 --> 3391.98]  And by things
[3391.98 --> 3393.52]  When your treasure
[3393.52 --> 3394.34]  Is Jesus
[3394.34 --> 3394.78]  Though
[3394.78 --> 3395.70]  You are set free
[3395.70 --> 3396.46]  To soar
[3396.46 --> 3398.10]  Above the rat race
[3398.10 --> 3399.48]  When your treasure
[3399.48 --> 3401.68]  Is the next best thing
[3401.68 --> 3402.62]  Your heart
[3402.62 --> 3403.32]  Is wandering
[3403.32 --> 3403.96]  And jumping
[3403.96 --> 3405.14]  Fickly
[3405.14 --> 3406.20]  From one thing
[3406.20 --> 3406.78]  To the next
[3406.78 --> 3408.04]  But never satisfied
[3408.04 --> 3409.12]  As you try to take in
[3409.12 --> 3410.22]  More and more
[3410.22 --> 3410.70]  And more
[3410.70 --> 3411.24]  And you just
[3411.24 --> 3412.28]  Constantly feel
[3412.28 --> 3413.12]  Empty
[3413.12 --> 3414.80]  But when your treasure
[3414.80 --> 3415.62]  Is Jesus
[3415.62 --> 3417.26]  You're finally able
[3417.26 --> 3418.30]  To find rest
[3418.30 --> 3419.94]  For your souls
[3419.94 --> 3424.00]  In the words
[3424.00 --> 3425.06]  Of the Heidelberg
[3425.06 --> 3425.64]  Catechism
[3425.64 --> 3427.46]  Which is a document
[3427.46 --> 3428.48]  That the Reformed
[3428.48 --> 3429.10]  Church has
[3429.10 --> 3430.56]  Held up
[3430.56 --> 3431.30]  As a historic
[3431.30 --> 3432.40]  And accurate
[3432.40 --> 3432.96]  Summary
[3432.96 --> 3433.48]  Of the teachings
[3433.48 --> 3434.10]  Of the Bible
[3434.10 --> 3435.16]  In question and answer
[3435.16 --> 3435.76]  49
[3435.76 --> 3437.16]  It asks
[3437.16 --> 3438.16]  How does
[3438.16 --> 3439.28]  Christ's ascension
[3439.28 --> 3440.40]  Benefit us?
[3440.46 --> 3441.00]  I think we have
[3441.00 --> 3441.56]  This slide
[3441.56 --> 3441.80]  Right?
[3441.80 --> 3441.88]  Right?
[3441.88 --> 3445.76]  How does
[3445.76 --> 3446.84]  Christ's ascension
[3446.84 --> 3448.12]  Benefit us?
[3448.22 --> 3448.92]  And at the end
[3448.92 --> 3449.86]  Of this beautifully
[3449.86 --> 3451.08]  Stated paragraph
[3451.08 --> 3452.92]  It says
[3452.92 --> 3453.92]  That Christ
[3453.92 --> 3454.40]  Jesus
[3454.40 --> 3455.76]  Sends his spirit
[3455.76 --> 3456.84]  To us on earth
[3456.84 --> 3457.96]  As a corresponding
[3457.96 --> 3458.90]  Pledge
[3458.90 --> 3460.08]  And by the spirit's
[3460.08 --> 3460.52]  Power
[3460.52 --> 3461.62]  We seek
[3461.62 --> 3463.30]  Not earthly things
[3463.30 --> 3464.96]  But the things
[3464.96 --> 3465.68]  Above
[3465.68 --> 3468.62]  God
[3468.62 --> 3470.22]  In Jesus
[3470.22 --> 3471.48]  And the Holy Spirit
[3471.48 --> 3473.52]  Those are the
[3473.52 --> 3474.60]  Riches
[3474.60 --> 3476.84]  Of his ascension
[3476.84 --> 3478.10]  For you
[3478.10 --> 3480.12]  And so we have
[3480.12 --> 3480.94]  A hope that cannot
[3480.94 --> 3482.00]  Spoil or fade
[3482.00 --> 3483.08]  We have a riches
[3483.08 --> 3484.18]  That will not
[3484.18 --> 3485.00]  Ever
[3485.00 --> 3486.06]  Fall away
[3486.06 --> 3487.02]  Because they are
[3487.02 --> 3487.90]  A person
[3487.90 --> 3489.06]  They are God himself
[3489.06 --> 3490.04]  And lastly
[3490.04 --> 3490.64]  We have
[3490.64 --> 3491.52]  Power
[3491.52 --> 3493.08]  You have
[3493.08 --> 3494.00]  Power
[3494.00 --> 3495.22]  Now the word
[3495.22 --> 3496.06]  That's used here
[3496.06 --> 3496.60]  In Greek
[3496.60 --> 3497.86]  Is dunamis
[3497.86 --> 3498.94]  It's the word
[3498.94 --> 3499.66]  That we get
[3499.66 --> 3500.58]  The English word
[3500.58 --> 3501.46]  Dynamite
[3501.46 --> 3502.00]  From
[3502.00 --> 3504.22]  God is saying
[3504.22 --> 3504.98]  You have
[3504.98 --> 3506.18]  Explosive
[3506.18 --> 3506.86]  Power
[3506.86 --> 3507.70]  You have
[3507.70 --> 3508.70]  Transformative
[3508.70 --> 3509.14]  Power
[3509.14 --> 3509.98]  To change
[3509.98 --> 3510.82]  The face
[3510.82 --> 3511.70]  Of the earth
[3511.70 --> 3514.94]  I grew up
[3514.94 --> 3515.84]  In Ontario
[3515.84 --> 3516.56]  Every summer
[3516.56 --> 3517.18]  We would go
[3517.18 --> 3518.52]  To Kilbear Park
[3518.52 --> 3518.94]  You guys
[3518.94 --> 3519.58]  Have grown up
[3519.58 --> 3520.06]  In the mountains
[3520.06 --> 3520.72]  And so this
[3520.72 --> 3521.40]  Will make sense
[3521.40 --> 3521.82]  To you
[3521.82 --> 3523.58]  To get to
[3523.58 --> 3524.32]  Kilbear Park
[3524.32 --> 3525.20]  You have to
[3525.20 --> 3526.00]  Travel north
[3526.00 --> 3526.88]  From where I grew up
[3526.88 --> 3527.98]  Along highway 400
[3527.98 --> 3528.70]  And then after
[3528.70 --> 3529.30]  The city of
[3529.30 --> 3529.62]  Barry
[3529.62 --> 3530.58]  You take
[3530.58 --> 3531.60]  Either highway 11
[3531.60 --> 3532.90]  Or highway 400
[3532.90 --> 3533.46]  Extension
[3533.46 --> 3534.98]  And to get to
[3534.98 --> 3535.54]  Kilbear
[3535.54 --> 3536.04]  There was a
[3536.04 --> 3536.92]  Two lane road
[3536.92 --> 3539.14]  That was
[3539.14 --> 3540.06]  Eventually turned
[3540.06 --> 3541.02]  Into highway 69
[3541.02 --> 3542.34]  And at some point
[3542.34 --> 3543.72]  In my young childhood
[3543.72 --> 3544.52]  The government of
[3544.52 --> 3545.38]  Ontario decided
[3545.38 --> 3546.34]  We are going to
[3546.34 --> 3547.02]  Turn this into
[3547.02 --> 3547.94]  A major highway
[3547.94 --> 3549.74]  And so northern
[3549.74 --> 3550.40]  Ontario is
[3550.40 --> 3551.42]  Canadian shield
[3551.42 --> 3553.06]  So it's hard
[3553.06 --> 3554.62]  Granite rock
[3554.62 --> 3556.30]  To take a
[3556.30 --> 3557.02]  Two lane road
[3557.02 --> 3557.66]  And turn it
[3557.66 --> 3558.34]  Into a
[3558.34 --> 3559.04]  Four lane
[3559.04 --> 3559.64]  Sometimes
[3559.64 --> 3560.76]  Six lane
[3560.76 --> 3561.32]  Highway
[3561.32 --> 3563.46]  Takes a lot
[3563.46 --> 3564.46]  Of work
[3564.46 --> 3565.56]  Particularly
[3565.56 --> 3567.16]  It takes a lot
[3567.16 --> 3568.16]  Of explosive
[3568.16 --> 3569.32]  Work
[3569.32 --> 3570.22]  And so over
[3570.22 --> 3570.96]  The next number
[3570.96 --> 3571.50]  Of years
[3571.50 --> 3572.08]  Every year
[3572.08 --> 3572.62]  We would drive
[3572.62 --> 3572.88]  Up to
[3572.88 --> 3573.52]  Kilbear Park
[3573.52 --> 3574.50]  And that section
[3574.50 --> 3575.54]  That was two lanes
[3575.54 --> 3576.34]  Would get shorter
[3576.34 --> 3576.74]  And shorter
[3576.74 --> 3577.26]  And shorter
[3577.26 --> 3578.40]  As the section
[3578.40 --> 3579.22]  That was four lanes
[3579.22 --> 3579.78]  Would get longer
[3579.78 --> 3580.18]  And longer
[3580.18 --> 3580.62]  And longer
[3580.62 --> 3581.70]  And we would drive
[3581.70 --> 3582.54]  Through these places
[3582.54 --> 3583.44]  That were just
[3583.44 --> 3584.26]  Sheer rock
[3584.26 --> 3585.22]  On either side
[3585.22 --> 3586.22]  Because it's easier
[3586.22 --> 3587.48]  To blow the rock up
[3587.48 --> 3588.58]  And build a flat road
[3588.58 --> 3589.54]  Than it is to try
[3589.54 --> 3590.28]  And move with the grade
[3590.28 --> 3592.42]  But what's amazing
[3592.42 --> 3593.90]  Is that in order
[3593.90 --> 3594.58]  For them to blow
[3594.58 --> 3595.08]  That rock
[3595.08 --> 3595.82]  They take this
[3595.82 --> 3597.44]  Like two inch drill
[3597.44 --> 3598.50]  And they core
[3598.50 --> 3599.36]  All the way
[3599.36 --> 3600.42]  Down the side
[3600.42 --> 3601.16]  And they pack it
[3601.16 --> 3602.38]  With an explosive
[3602.38 --> 3603.16]  And then they
[3603.16 --> 3604.52]  Fire off
[3604.52 --> 3605.34]  These charges
[3605.34 --> 3606.56]  Every two feet
[3606.56 --> 3607.86]  Or these core lines
[3607.86 --> 3609.16]  Like down the side
[3609.16 --> 3609.64]  Of the rock
[3609.64 --> 3610.70]  So that now
[3610.70 --> 3611.82]  When you drive there
[3611.82 --> 3613.66]  On the sheer cliff face
[3613.66 --> 3614.88]  There's these perfectly
[3614.88 --> 3617.66]  Semi-circular core lines
[3617.66 --> 3619.02]  Every two feet
[3619.02 --> 3620.28]  Going down
[3620.28 --> 3621.18]  Because that's
[3621.18 --> 3622.62]  Where the explosive
[3622.62 --> 3623.66]  Was
[3623.66 --> 3625.42]  The explosive
[3625.42 --> 3627.58]  Changed the face
[3627.58 --> 3628.56]  Of the earth
[3628.56 --> 3630.08]  The geography
[3630.08 --> 3630.86]  Of the region
[3630.86 --> 3631.50]  Was changed
[3631.50 --> 3632.06]  By this
[3632.06 --> 3633.92]  Dynamic power
[3633.92 --> 3636.14]  That's the kind
[3636.14 --> 3636.82]  Of power
[3636.82 --> 3638.68]  That you have
[3638.68 --> 3639.88]  By virtue
[3639.88 --> 3640.72]  Of the Holy Spirit
[3640.72 --> 3642.00]  Being in you
[3642.00 --> 3644.20]  That's the Holy Spirit
[3644.20 --> 3645.50]  Right?
[3645.54 --> 3647.10]  As He transforms you
[3647.10 --> 3648.42]  You transform
[3648.42 --> 3649.38]  Those around you
[3649.38 --> 3650.74]  And as we
[3650.74 --> 3651.60]  Are transformed
[3651.60 --> 3652.12]  Together
[3652.12 --> 3654.08]  We are transforming
[3654.08 --> 3654.98]  Our neighborhoods
[3654.98 --> 3656.08]  And our communities
[3656.08 --> 3657.38]  Our workplaces
[3657.38 --> 3658.98]  And our third places
[3658.98 --> 3659.68]  Our hangouts
[3659.68 --> 3660.42]  Our coffee shops
[3660.42 --> 3661.30]  Our sports teams
[3661.30 --> 3662.38]  This is the power
[3662.38 --> 3663.32]  Of God at work
[3663.32 --> 3664.02]  In you
[3664.02 --> 3665.36]  Changing the face
[3665.36 --> 3666.76]  Of the earth
[3666.76 --> 3668.48]  Right?
[3668.52 --> 3669.04]  And so when God
[3669.04 --> 3669.64]  Calls you
[3669.64 --> 3670.54]  To something bigger
[3670.54 --> 3671.54]  Than yourself
[3671.54 --> 3672.56]  And you say
[3672.56 --> 3673.46]  I don't think
[3673.46 --> 3674.28]  I can do that God
[3674.28 --> 3675.48]  That's too big for me
[3675.48 --> 3677.32]  You are absolutely right
[3677.32 --> 3679.52]  It is too big for you
[3679.52 --> 3681.04]  But you know
[3681.04 --> 3682.08]  Who it's not too big for?
[3682.86 --> 3683.48]  God
[3683.48 --> 3685.72]  That's His power
[3685.72 --> 3687.66]  God's power
[3687.66 --> 3689.66]  God's guarantee
[3689.66 --> 3691.98]  God placed everything
[3691.98 --> 3693.14]  Under His feet
[3693.14 --> 3694.08]  And appointed Him
[3694.08 --> 3694.80]  To be head
[3694.80 --> 3696.20]  Over everything
[3696.20 --> 3697.42]  For the church
[3697.42 --> 3699.58]  And so He is the head
[3699.58 --> 3701.04]  He is the source
[3701.04 --> 3702.42]  Over everything
[3702.42 --> 3704.34]  And so now
[3704.34 --> 3705.60]  Sometimes
[3705.60 --> 3706.84]  You will hear
[3706.84 --> 3709.16]  In Reformed circles
[3709.16 --> 3710.82]  In Reformed theology
[3710.82 --> 3712.50]  Quoting Abraham Kuyper
[3712.50 --> 3713.98]  Abraham Kuyper
[3713.98 --> 3715.14]  Was a Dutch theologian
[3715.14 --> 3716.00]  And politician
[3716.00 --> 3717.74]  He was prime minister
[3717.74 --> 3718.52]  In the Netherlands
[3718.52 --> 3720.72]  In the early 20th century
[3720.72 --> 3721.90]  For a period of time
[3721.90 --> 3722.38]  As well
[3722.38 --> 3723.74]  And he came
[3723.74 --> 3725.42]  Across the ocean
[3725.42 --> 3726.32]  And spoke at
[3726.32 --> 3727.34]  Princeton University
[3727.34 --> 3729.16]  In the now famous
[3729.16 --> 3730.18]  Stone lectures
[3730.18 --> 3732.10]  And one of those lectures
[3732.10 --> 3733.46]  He said
[3733.46 --> 3733.96]  And this quote
[3733.96 --> 3734.72]  Has become famous
[3734.72 --> 3735.26]  He says
[3735.26 --> 3736.60]  There is not
[3736.60 --> 3737.90]  One square inch
[3737.90 --> 3738.72]  Of creation
[3738.72 --> 3739.78]  Over which Jesus
[3739.78 --> 3741.84]  Who is Lord over all
[3741.84 --> 3743.54]  Does not say
[3743.54 --> 3744.92]  Mine
[3744.92 --> 3749.26]  Every square inch
[3749.26 --> 3750.88]  Belongs
[3750.88 --> 3752.44]  To Him
[3752.44 --> 3754.82]  Every square inch
[3754.82 --> 3755.64]  Has been put
[3755.64 --> 3758.28]  Under His feet
[3758.28 --> 3760.48]  And here is what
[3760.48 --> 3761.10]  I want you to hear
[3761.10 --> 3763.70]  If everything
[3763.70 --> 3764.60]  Is His
[3764.60 --> 3766.60]  You
[3766.60 --> 3767.62]  Have nothing
[3767.62 --> 3768.14]  To give
[3768.14 --> 3768.64]  That is not
[3768.64 --> 3769.40]  Already His
[3769.40 --> 3771.12]  But
[3771.12 --> 3772.90]  He gives you
[3772.90 --> 3774.22]  Everything
[3774.22 --> 3775.70]  Because He has
[3775.70 --> 3776.30]  Given you
[3776.30 --> 3777.04]  Himself
[3777.04 --> 3780.10]  God has given you
[3780.10 --> 3781.04]  Jesus
[3781.04 --> 3781.94]  He has given you
[3781.94 --> 3782.66]  Himself
[3782.66 --> 3783.18]  And so
[3783.18 --> 3783.92]  He has given you
[3783.92 --> 3784.50]  Hope
[3784.50 --> 3785.62]  And He has given you
[3785.62 --> 3786.32]  Riches
[3786.32 --> 3787.12]  And He has given you
[3787.12 --> 3787.86]  Power
[3787.86 --> 3790.32]  That is the impact
[3790.32 --> 3791.02]  Of the gospel
[3791.02 --> 3792.10]  Of our ascended
[3792.10 --> 3792.86]  Savior
[3792.86 --> 3793.78]  And King
[3793.78 --> 3796.20]  And that
[3796.20 --> 3798.76]  That is the joy
[3798.76 --> 3801.34]  Of being underfoot
[3801.34 --> 3803.86]  The fullness of Him
[3803.86 --> 3805.06]  Who fills everything
[3805.06 --> 3806.54]  In every way
[3806.54 --> 3809.12]  Gospel hope
[3809.12 --> 3811.12]  Gospel riches
[3811.12 --> 3812.90]  Gospel inheritance
[3812.90 --> 3814.70]  Gospel power
[3814.70 --> 3816.80]  And so I pray
[3816.80 --> 3818.28]  Joining with Paul
