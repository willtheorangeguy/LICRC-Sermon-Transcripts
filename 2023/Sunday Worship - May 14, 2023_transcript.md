[647.48 --> 660.98]  Good morning. Welcome to church. And may I also just say happy Mother's Day to you who are mothers.
[661.18 --> 669.40]  We celebrate you this morning and we are grateful that you are here. On this day of days, we're also
[669.40 --> 677.24]  mindful of those who are mourning lost mums, those who do not have a good relationship with their mom
[677.24 --> 683.64]  and those who wish they could be mothers and who for one reason or another are unable to. And so our
[683.64 --> 691.80]  heart goes out to you as well today. As we gather together in worship, we do so as a diverse group
[691.80 --> 699.42]  of people coming from all sorts of different places into this place as a family of believers.
[700.50 --> 705.64]  And so we welcome you into worship. If you're visiting with us this morning, my name is Chris.
[705.64 --> 710.86]  I'm one of the pastors here and it's my privilege to lead this morning with these others on stage and
[710.86 --> 716.86]  a few others. We will come to the table later in our service. And so if you are participating online,
[717.08 --> 722.90]  we encourage you at some point to join us and prepare your hearts and your space for that
[722.90 --> 728.12]  as we come to the table together. Before we begin, there's a couple announcements to make.
[728.12 --> 738.46]  First of all, you may have seen on screen, but this coming Thursday, we are celebrating Ascension Day.
[739.54 --> 747.42]  Now, you probably are aware, but just over a week ago, King Charles III was coronated as king and
[747.42 --> 755.06]  millions of people participated and watched and celebrated that. Ascension Day is kind of like
[755.06 --> 762.54]  the coronation of King Jesus. We acknowledge his kingship. We acknowledge his sovereign rule and
[762.54 --> 769.70]  reign from the right hand of God where he has ascended to. And so we gather to sing praises
[769.70 --> 777.80]  to him and to worship him and to learn what it means to be a disciple in his kingdom. And so 6 p.m.
[777.80 --> 785.06]  on Thursday, we invite you to join us for worship. We know that that is a bit of a tight time crunch,
[785.20 --> 789.46]  but we really want young families to be able to come. And if we start later than that, it gets into
[789.46 --> 793.92]  bedtime, especially because it's, oh, it's not a school night, but it's still going to be late.
[794.44 --> 798.04]  So, or not a school night for at least LCS kids. I don't know about the other kids.
[798.90 --> 806.72]  Anyway, 6 p.m. Thursday night, please join us for worship. As well, you may have seen in a couple
[806.72 --> 814.38]  weeks' time on May 28th, pastor's class is going to begin. And so that's for those of you primarily
[814.38 --> 820.64]  young people who have gone through our catechism and church education program and are looking to
[820.64 --> 827.82]  take that next step in your faith where you own this shared faith as your own. And so if you have
[827.82 --> 836.02]  questions about that, talk to either Pastor Kevin or to myself. Additionally, this is for a number of
[836.02 --> 843.26]  you who have been visiting with us regularly. On June 4, so the week after this profession,
[843.40 --> 847.80]  this beginning of pastor's class, but on June 4, we're going to, as part of our worship,
[848.46 --> 854.14]  welcome a group of new members and welcome a group of people who have gone through pastor's
[854.14 --> 859.40]  class, or not pastor's class, who've gone through Christianity Explored and that process and some
[859.40 --> 863.60]  other conversations. So if you have been worshiping with us and are not a member but have questions
[863.60 --> 868.90]  about what that might look like, grab me after service and I will give you details and then
[868.90 --> 876.92]  maybe you want to participate in that welcome and celebration as well on June 4. I think that's it for
[876.92 --> 881.96]  announcements. I'm going to invite you as you are able to stand and we can be gathered up in the
[881.96 --> 893.66]  presence of God as he welcomes us and greets us. Receive the greeting of our good God. Grace, mercy,
[894.12 --> 900.68]  and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, Son and our Savior, through the
[900.68 --> 906.94]  presence and power of the Holy Spirit. Amen. I'm going to invite you to turn to those around you and
[906.94 --> 909.00]  welcome them into worship this morning.
[934.68 --> 935.40]  Good morning.
[936.94 --> 943.10]  Our call to worship this morning, our call to worship this morning as we look forward to
[943.10 --> 954.32]  celebrating the Lord's Supper together, comes from a favorite verse for many of us who learned it
[954.32 --> 962.52]  at an early age as young children, John 3, 16. For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only
[962.52 --> 970.98]  son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. Please join us in celebrating
[970.98 --> 976.02]  God's amazing love for us this morning by worshiping him together.
[976.02 --> 980.26]  hymn.

[1016.04 --> 1023.58]  Come all you sinners, come find His mercy
[1023.58 --> 1027.70]  Come to the table, He will satisfy
[1027.70 --> 1034.34]  Taste of His goodness, find what you're looking for
[1034.34 --> 1041.50]  For God so loved the world that He gave us
[1041.50 --> 1045.94]  His one and only Son to save us
[1045.94 --> 1051.00]  Whoever believes in Him will live forever

[1059.12 --> 1063.42]  Come and lay them down at the foot of the cross
[1063.42 --> 1069.70]  Jesus is waiting there with open arms

[1133.00 --> 1144.00]  Praise Him, praise Him for the wonders of His love.
[1144.00 --> 1153.00]  For God so loved the world that He gave us, His one and only Son to save us.
[1153.00 --> 1170.00]  Whoever believes in Him will live forever.
[1170.00 --> 1177.00]  The power of hell forever defeated, now it is well.
[1177.00 --> 1188.00]  I'm walking in freedom for God so loved, God so loved the world.
[1188.00 --> 1198.00]  Bring all your failures, bring your addictions, come lay them down at the foot of the cross.
[1198.00 --> 1206.00]  Jesus is waiting, God so loved the world.
[1207.00 --> 1212.00]  Lord, I come, I confess.
[1212.00 --> 1213.00]  Amen.
[1242.00 --> 1246.14]  I find my rest
[1246.14 --> 1248.70]  Without you
[1248.70 --> 1253.00]  I fall apart
[1253.00 --> 1256.00]  You're the one
[1257.46 --> 1261.00]  That guides my heart
[1261.68 --> 1268.00]  Lord, I need you
[1268.00 --> 1273.00]  Oh, I need you
[1273.00 --> 1280.00]  Every hour I need you
[1280.00 --> 1284.00]  My one defense

[1287.00 --> 1293.00]  Oh God, how I need you
[1293.00 --> 1301.00]  Where sin runs deep
[1302.00 --> 1305.00]  Your grace is more
[1305.00 --> 1309.00]  Where grace is found
[1309.00 --> 1313.00]  Is where you are
[1313.00 --> 1317.00]  And where you are
[1317.00 --> 1321.00]  Lord, I am free

[1364.00 --> 1367.00]  My righteousness
[1367.00 --> 1373.00]  Oh God, how I need you
[1373.00 --> 1377.00]  To teach my song
[1377.00 --> 1379.00]  To rise to you
[1379.00 --> 1386.00]  When temptation comes my way
[1386.00 --> 1390.00]  And when I cannot stand
[1390.00 --> 1393.00]  I'll fall on you
[1393.00 --> 1397.00]  Jesus, you're my hope
[1397.00 --> 1399.00]  And stay
[1399.00 --> 1402.00]  And when I cannot stand
[1402.00 --> 1405.00]  I'll fall on you
[1405.00 --> 1409.00]  Jesus, you're my hope
[1409.00 --> 1410.00]  For my hope
[1410.00 --> 1411.00]  And stay

[1472.76 --> 1488.78]  My one defense, my righteousness, O God, how I need you.
[1490.86 --> 1492.06]  You may have a seat.
[1496.54 --> 1500.32]  Please join me in our prayer of confession this morning.
[1500.32 --> 1506.94]  God, our Father in heaven, we know that you love us immensely.
[1508.48 --> 1513.12]  We thank you for the greatest gift to us, your Son, Jesus Christ.
[1514.62 --> 1520.20]  John 3.16 describes so beautifully your amazing love and perfect plan for us.
[1520.86 --> 1523.84]  God, you love us with an everlasting love.
[1524.88 --> 1527.34]  We are your children and are so thankful.
[1527.34 --> 1535.66]  You knew from the beginning of time that life for us would be full of challenges and temptations and uncertainty.
[1536.34 --> 1540.22]  You knew that we would fall short and sin and make mistakes.
[1541.48 --> 1542.90]  Please forgive us.
[1542.90 --> 1547.22]  Thank you for sending your Son, Jesus, to earth.
[1548.00 --> 1553.72]  Jesus, who lived a perfect, sinless life and demonstrated for us the right way to live
[1553.72 --> 1559.26]  and willingly gave his own life as a complete sacrifice for our sins.
[1560.72 --> 1564.60]  Jesus, our loving Savior and Redeemer, we are forever grateful.
[1564.60 --> 1567.56]  Only you are worthy of our praise.
[1568.50 --> 1570.10]  We pray in your name alone.
[1571.10 --> 1571.42]  Amen.
[1575.92 --> 1578.24]  Please rise as we sing I'm Forever Grateful.
[1578.24 --> 1605.24]  You did not wait for me to draw near to you,
[1605.24 --> 1609.64]  But you clothed yourself in frail humanity.
[1611.72 --> 1617.96]  You did not wait for me to cry out to you,

[1785.44 --> 1788.44]  I want to thank you,
[1788.44 --> 1791.44]  And I hope you've been a minister,
[1791.44 --> 1793.44]  And I hope you've been a part of my journey for you.

[1796.44 --> 1799.44]  And it's a win-sync from Paul Curiel in your office.

[2043.90 --> 2047.90]  Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this.
[2047.90 --> 2055.90]  To look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.
[2055.90 --> 2075.90]  Next week's collection will be for Wagner Hills.
[2075.90 --> 2083.90]  How great the chasm that lay between us!
[2083.90 --> 2089.90]  How high the mountain I cannot climb!
[2089.90 --> 2103.90]  In desperation I turned to heaven and spoke your name into the night.
[2103.90 --> 2117.90]  Then through the darkness your loving kindness tore through the shadows of my soul.
[2117.90 --> 2132.90]  The work is finished, the end is written, Jesus Christ my living hope.
[2132.90 --> 2142.90]  The Lord, who could imagine so great a mercy?
[2142.90 --> 2148.90]  What heart could fathom such boundless grace?
[2148.90 --> 2162.90]  The God of ages, step down from glory, to wear my sin and bear my shame.
[2162.90 --> 2168.90]  The cross has spoken, I am forgiven.
[2168.90 --> 2176.90]  The King of kings, the King of kings calls me His own.
[2176.90 --> 2182.90]  Beautiful Savior, I'm Yours forever.
[2182.90 --> 2190.90]  Jesus Christ my living hope.
[2190.90 --> 2192.90]  Hallelujah!
[2192.90 --> 2197.90]  Praise the one who set me free!
[2197.90 --> 2200.90]  Hallelujah!
[2200.90 --> 2204.90]  Death has lost its grip on me!
[2204.90 --> 2205.90]  Death has lost its grip on me!
[2205.90 --> 2207.90]  You have broken every chain!
[2207.90 --> 2210.90]  There's salvation in your name!
[2210.90 --> 2217.90]  Jesus Christ my living hope!
[2217.90 --> 2219.90]  Hallelujah!
[2219.90 --> 2220.90]  Hallelujah!
[2220.90 --> 2221.90]  Praise the one who set me free!
[2221.90 --> 2222.90]  Hallelujah!
[2222.90 --> 2224.90]  Praise the one who set me free!
[2224.90 --> 2225.90]  Hallelujah!
[2225.90 --> 2226.90]  Hallelujah!
[2226.90 --> 2227.90]  Death has lost its grip on me!
[2227.90 --> 2228.90]  Hallelujah!
[2228.90 --> 2230.90]  Death has lost its grip on me!
[2230.90 --> 2232.90]  You have broken every chain!
[2232.90 --> 2233.90]  There's salvation in your name!
[2233.90 --> 2248.90]  Jesus Christ my living hope!
[2248.90 --> 2256.90]  Then came the morning that sealed the promise!
[2256.90 --> 2262.90]  Your buried body began to breathe!
[2262.90 --> 2277.90]  Out of the silence, the roaring lion declared the grave has no claim on me!
[2277.90 --> 2284.90]  Then came the morning that sealed the promise!
[2284.90 --> 2291.90]  Your buried body began to breathe!
[2291.90 --> 2305.90]  Out of the silence, the roaring lion declares the grave has no claim on me!
[2305.90 --> 2314.90]  Jesus, yours is the victory!
[2314.90 --> 2315.90]  Hallelujah!
[2315.90 --> 2316.90]  Hallelujah!
[2316.90 --> 2317.90]  Hallelujah!
[2317.90 --> 2322.90]  Praise the one who set me free!
[2322.90 --> 2323.90]  Hallelujah!
[2323.90 --> 2329.90]  Death has lost its grip on me!
[2329.90 --> 2332.90]  You have broken every chain!
[2332.90 --> 2335.90]  There's salvation in your name!
[2335.90 --> 2342.90]  Jesus Christ my living hope!
[2342.90 --> 2343.90]  Hallelujah!
[2343.90 --> 2344.90]  Hallelujah!
[2344.90 --> 2345.90]  Hallelujah!
[2345.90 --> 2349.90]  Praise the one who set me free!
[2349.90 --> 2350.90]  Hallelujah!
[2350.90 --> 2351.90]  Hallelujah!
[2351.90 --> 2352.90]  Hallelujah!
[2352.90 --> 2353.90]  Hallelujah!
[2353.90 --> 2356.90]  Death has lost its grip on me!
[2356.90 --> 2359.90]  You have broken every chain!
[2359.90 --> 2363.90]  There's salvation in your name!
[2363.90 --> 2366.90]  Jesus Christ my living hope!
[2366.90 --> 2370.90]  Jesus Christ my living hope!
[2370.90 --> 2376.90]  Jesus Christ my living hope!
[2376.90 --> 2384.90]  Oh God you are my living hope!
[2384.90 --> 2394.90]  Jesus Christ my living hope!
[2394.90 --> 2399.90]  Jesus Christ my living hope!
[2399.90 --> 2406.88]  My name's Eric. I'm on council, and today is Office Bearer Affirmation Sunday.
[2409.76 --> 2414.24]  Today we're grateful for the service of the office bearers in this church.
[2414.42 --> 2419.54]  Today Emo Smid and Glenn Nort are both retiring after they've completed their terms,
[2419.66 --> 2425.56]  so we are grateful that they have been willing to serve the church here for the last three years.
[2425.56 --> 2431.04]  Glenn was the vice chair and clerk for the last couple of years,
[2431.24 --> 2436.72]  and Emo Smid was the deacon and chair of the deacons for the last number of years.
[2437.50 --> 2441.94]  So on behalf of the council and the church, we want to thank Glenn's not here, don't think, and Emo's there.
[2442.06 --> 2444.02]  Thank you for your service to the church family.
[2444.96 --> 2448.70]  This morning we have the chance to approve a slate of nominees for the new positions.
[2448.70 --> 2454.80]  The bylaws in the Constitution of Langley Emanuel requires that the members affirm the slate of nominees.
[2455.56 --> 2457.84]  We need one deacon and two admin elders.
[2458.24 --> 2462.00]  Once approved, we will draw lots from these eligible and gifted candidates.
[2463.20 --> 2468.98]  Eric Hubert has got the ballots, so he will come forward with someone else to hand out these ballots.
[2469.12 --> 2476.70]  On the ballots you are receiving, if you affirm the slate, check or X the top of the box, the top box.
[2476.96 --> 2481.64]  If you don't affirm of one or more of the names, please check the bottom box
[2481.64 --> 2485.38]  and write the names of the person or persons you don't affirm.
[2486.74 --> 2493.30]  The proposed slate for the affirmations are for the office of deacon are Mike Prins and Carolyn Spohr.
[2494.10 --> 2499.52]  For the office of admin elder is Paul Kuhl, Clary Klosterhoff, and Steve Verkike.
[2499.52 --> 2503.84]  Again, today this ballot is for affirmation only.
[2503.84 --> 2512.78]  By voting yes, you are agreeing with the recommendations of council that each of the above individuals is capable and gifted to serve in his or her respective nomination.
[2512.78 --> 2515.44]  In both cases, we have nominations.
[2517.12 --> 2522.54]  In both cases, we have more nominations than needed office bearers.
[2522.64 --> 2529.36]  Therefore, after the names are affirmed this week, we will draw lots for the needed positions next week.
[2530.24 --> 2534.14]  One lot for the deacon position and two lots for the admin elder positions.
[2535.42 --> 2539.38]  Lord willing, our installation service will be on Pentecost Sunday on May 28.
[2539.38 --> 2545.38]  At the end of the service, there will be two elders at the back doors to collect your completed ballot.
[2546.26 --> 2551.94]  The results will come out counted and sent out an update in the midweek memo on Tuesday.
[2553.28 --> 2555.42]  And nobody's allowed to escape the side doors.
[2556.68 --> 2557.56]  Oh, we got security.
[2557.94 --> 2558.64]  We got security.
[2558.82 --> 2561.34]  So you got to go through the back doors, hand in your ballot.
[2563.16 --> 2564.08]  Thank you so much.
[2564.14 --> 2567.32]  I think Eric is going to hand out the forms.
[2567.32 --> 2570.36]  But at this time, we're going to do Kids Corner Children's Worship Time.
[2570.44 --> 2571.68]  You kids can come up front.
[2588.86 --> 2590.32]  There's a little bit of energy here.
[2590.38 --> 2591.06]  There's a little buzz.
[2591.30 --> 2592.90]  Everybody got lots of energy and excited?
[2593.22 --> 2593.50]  Yeah.
[2594.00 --> 2594.94]  What day is it today?
[2594.94 --> 2596.20]  My Mother's Day.
[2596.20 --> 2600.86]  Who, praise your hand, who this morning made breakfast for their mom already this morning?
[2600.96 --> 2601.74]  Did something nice?
[2602.42 --> 2602.64]  Yeah?
[2603.10 --> 2603.38]  No?
[2603.54 --> 2604.40]  Somebody's saying no?
[2604.60 --> 2604.88]  Uh-oh.
[2606.44 --> 2611.12]  Who made a nice craft or card that they were able to give their mom this morning?
[2611.24 --> 2611.88]  All right.
[2612.10 --> 2612.86]  We got some.
[2613.34 --> 2614.08]  Good, good, good.
[2615.16 --> 2618.74]  And who's going to continue to spoil their mom all day long?
[2618.74 --> 2622.58]  Do everything she asks?
[2623.20 --> 2625.08]  Clean the dishes?
[2626.08 --> 2627.24]  Clean up after yourself?
[2627.46 --> 2627.92]  Good, good.
[2628.02 --> 2628.18]  Okay.
[2629.98 --> 2631.68]  Because today we're talking about forgiveness.
[2631.90 --> 2635.66]  And if you don't do those things, you might have to ask for a little bit of forgiveness after this day.
[2636.88 --> 2638.46]  Who knows what forgiveness means?
[2639.74 --> 2640.26]  You do?
[2640.26 --> 2647.54]  You do something wrong, and then it's mom that's like, they forgive that you do.
[2647.54 --> 2648.20]  That's right.
[2648.28 --> 2652.72]  So when you do something wrong and somebody asks, you have to maybe ask for forgiveness.
[2652.88 --> 2655.06]  Or what's another word we sometimes use for forgiveness?
[2657.40 --> 2657.80]  Sorry.
[2657.80 --> 2666.66]  So today in children's worship time, we are going to go and talk a bit more about forgiveness in the room back there.
[2666.90 --> 2669.26]  But before we do that, we should do the children's blessing.
[2669.42 --> 2671.50]  So let's have everybody stand up, please.
[2677.60 --> 2678.00]  Ready?
[2678.68 --> 2678.96]  The.
[2679.48 --> 2681.02]  Lord be with you.
[2681.28 --> 2682.84]  And also with you.
[2687.80 --> 2715.40]  Good morning, everyone.
[2715.40 --> 2715.48]  Good morning, everyone.
[2717.80 --> 2718.72]  I'm Peter.
[2719.50 --> 2723.18]  I've been a member of this church for 37 years.
[2724.36 --> 2727.44]  My mother's name is Patricia.
[2728.32 --> 2731.04]  She passed away 10 years ago.
[2731.88 --> 2736.16]  I remember her fondly as a wonderful mother, a Christian mother.
[2737.08 --> 2742.44]  The last five years of her life, she entered into dementia and then Alzheimer's.
[2743.20 --> 2745.36]  I don't remember that part of her.
[2745.36 --> 2751.20]  It's a reality, though, for many of us who are older and who have parents who slip away.
[2751.94 --> 2755.16]  But I'm thinking of her, and I'm sure all of you are as well.
[2755.58 --> 2756.98]  I want to lead you into prayer.
[2756.98 --> 2762.26]  Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be your name.
[2763.54 --> 2765.02]  You're the God of creation.
[2766.48 --> 2769.36]  It's beginning, it's sustaining, and it's restoration.
[2769.36 --> 2789.08]  You are the God who has been with us throughout the generations, from Adam and Eve, to Abraham and Sarah, to Mary and Joseph, and to my mother and all mothers who we remember, and mothers who are here.
[2789.08 --> 2807.60]  You've been with us during this time of preaching series, when we have seen you work out your sovereignty in the life, even of the self-righteous, racist Jonah, and those apparently wicked people of Nineveh.
[2807.60 --> 2837.58]  We give you praise.
[2838.54 --> 2842.96]  We also come to bring before you our petitions as church family.
[2843.70 --> 2854.60]  This morning, we think of the leadership in our church, and we see that the process for new nominees has been completed here, and now also saying thanks to those who have served.
[2854.60 --> 2858.70]  We thank you, Lord, that there are people who want to serve.
[2859.20 --> 2861.18]  So important for your church.
[2861.60 --> 2863.54]  We thank you also for our pastors.
[2863.54 --> 2872.68]  We pray that they may feel encouraged and protected as they present the gospel, but also in their own personal lives.
[2873.50 --> 2874.08]  Be with them.
[2874.18 --> 2875.02]  Hold them strong.
[2875.16 --> 2876.18]  Keep them in your care.
[2876.86 --> 2881.34]  May counsel also surround them and support them with prayer and encouragement.
[2881.34 --> 2892.88]  We also recognize, Lord, in our church as part of a larger body.
[2892.88 --> 2900.68]  The Christian Reformed Church will be having a senate soon, and we pray for all those who will be involved in that work.
[2900.68 --> 2905.44]  We recognize also that there are people who are hurting.
[2905.44 --> 2916.18]  We just heard this week that Pearl Denhawn lost, Pearl's brother lost his wife at the age of 55.
[2916.18 --> 2917.40]  That hurts.
[2918.14 --> 2923.14]  We also know that there are those struggling with cancer.
[2923.28 --> 2933.30]  We think of Cy Visser and John Koning, and we think of the chemotherapies they're into, and we continue to uphold them.
[2933.38 --> 2934.46]  We see progress.
[2935.92 --> 2939.16]  We also seem to have a spate of broken bones.
[2939.38 --> 2945.76]  We think of Dick and Greta, Alvin's mom, and now Fritz, Prince's mom.
[2946.18 --> 2947.24]  Has broken a hip.
[2948.20 --> 2950.46]  We just pray for a quick and speedy healing.
[2950.94 --> 2964.46]  We also think of Doreen Birkenpass, who's had to have an operation, a fairly significant one, and we just pray for a blessing on that with respect to her heart.
[2965.72 --> 2971.68]  And we are thankful for the technology that she's able to receive to mediate that.
[2971.68 --> 2981.62]  We see also, Lord, our pastor calling those of us who feel inclined to confess their faith.
[2982.76 --> 2985.28]  And there are opportunities to do that.
[2985.28 --> 2988.12]  And we thank you for his leadership.
[2988.36 --> 3002.98]  But we also, Lord, ask you and prompt you, ask you to prompt in the lives of our young people and those who are older that they may consider this, this very important step.
[3002.98 --> 3005.66]  Lord, we live in confusing times.
[3006.36 --> 3012.44]  The mantra seems to be that we have permission to define our own truth.
[3013.28 --> 3016.82]  What's this about the church trying to define the truth for us?
[3016.82 --> 3026.10]  The idea that there is a God who has laid out for us a truth map rooted in love seems so out of step with our world today.
[3026.74 --> 3035.64]  Lord, we just pray that you will work in our lives, in our children's lives, in the lives of adults, in our culture.
[3035.64 --> 3047.08]  And we see evidence of, again, there's fires in Alberta, northern Alberta, with the stretch of weather.
[3047.62 --> 3050.92]  People are panicking, this excessive heat and drought.
[3051.98 --> 3056.18]  And yet, Lord, we know this is not a surprise.
[3056.18 --> 3061.62]  It's been mentioned through the Bible, drought, heat, fires.
[3062.30 --> 3067.12]  But we also recognize that in some respects, we're part of the problem.
[3067.72 --> 3070.94]  And that we're aggravating it with our lifestyles.
[3070.94 --> 3080.66]  And we pray, Lord, that we may become much more humble with how we use energy and how we live out our lives in the day-to-day living.
[3080.66 --> 3087.26]  Lord, we bring to mind our mothers this morning.
[3088.10 --> 3097.26]  And as Pastor has said, sometimes it's a complicated, complicated discussion about our mothers.
[3097.54 --> 3104.22]  But by and large, most of our mothers have been an amazing benefit to our lives.
[3104.82 --> 3109.02]  Some mothers have struggled in their relationship with their children, for sure.
[3109.02 --> 3111.04]  And as fathers.
[3111.84 --> 3114.44]  But we know that can be worked out.
[3114.52 --> 3116.16]  And it can be worked out in community.
[3117.30 --> 3121.38]  Lord, we just want to thank you for those who have gone before us.
[3121.66 --> 3128.90]  Those of us who've parted with our mothers who've passed on to glory.
[3129.22 --> 3130.26]  We thank you for them.
[3130.82 --> 3133.84]  But also today, for those mothers who are grandmothers.
[3134.42 --> 3135.82]  Lord, we recognize them.
[3135.82 --> 3140.98]  We think of mothers right in the middle of the activity of being a mother.
[3140.98 --> 3146.08]  That is a busy time, as all grandmothers will tell you, and grandfathers.
[3147.14 --> 3152.00]  And so we offer them up for a special measure of grace, your grace this morning.
[3152.40 --> 3153.58]  Thank you for them.
[3154.32 --> 3158.14]  And Lord, also for those who choose to remain single and not have children.
[3158.14 --> 3164.26]  We recognize that sometimes, as a church, we may overemphasize.
[3164.94 --> 3172.04]  But your calling also is for people to be, if they recognize your calling, to remain single.
[3172.44 --> 3177.34]  And sometimes childless, which has to be very difficult for them.
[3178.10 --> 3180.76]  So Lord, uphold them, too, during this time.
[3180.76 --> 3189.50]  We thank you for the church where we can be a home to all mothers or not mothers.
[3190.64 --> 3197.14]  We want to thank you, Father God, for Jesus Christ and your Holy Spirit.
[3197.28 --> 3199.22]  And for being able to come together to pray.
[3199.40 --> 3200.56]  For Jesus' sake, amen.
[3200.56 --> 3200.66]  Amen.
[3200.66 --> 3200.70]  Amen.
[3210.76 --> 3234.46]  As you can see over my shoulder, we're going to continue, actually, and conclude our brief
[3234.46 --> 3239.28]  look at the book of Jonah this morning together.
[3240.76 --> 3245.88]  If you have a Bible with you, or if you have a Bible on your device, I'm going to encourage
[3245.88 --> 3250.34]  you to open that up or turn it on and have Jonah 4 in front of you, and then to keep
[3250.34 --> 3253.84]  that in front of you as we go through together.
[3255.14 --> 3262.42]  Before we do so and have a look, we're going to read the text together.
[3262.92 --> 3265.64]  So I'm going to start at the beginning of chapter 4.
[3265.64 --> 3274.72]  But to Jonah, this seemed very wrong, and he became angry.
[3275.72 --> 3277.44]  Now, I'm just going to pause really quick.
[3278.38 --> 3287.76]  Jonah is angry because the Lord relented from the destruction that Jonah wanted to happen
[3287.76 --> 3288.72]  to the Ninevites.
[3288.72 --> 3295.18]  And so if you are familiar with the story, or even if you're not, Jonah was told by God
[3295.18 --> 3301.78]  to go to Nineveh and to proclaim to them that they would be judged for their wickedness in
[3301.78 --> 3305.50]  order that they might experience the forgiveness and the grace of God.
[3305.64 --> 3307.54]  And Jonah didn't like that call.
[3307.66 --> 3308.64]  And so he fled.
[3309.82 --> 3310.16]  Right?
[3310.24 --> 3314.88]  He went down to Joppa, and he got on a boat, and he started sailing to Tarshish, which was
[3314.88 --> 3315.80]  across the world.
[3316.64 --> 3321.28]  And while on the boat, a great storm came up, and the mariners that were on the boat said,
[3321.36 --> 3321.88]  what do we do?
[3321.96 --> 3322.48]  What do we do?
[3322.58 --> 3323.96]  Jonah said, throw me overboard.
[3324.58 --> 3330.34]  So Jonah was thrown overboard, and we read that a great fish came and swallowed him up.
[3330.40 --> 3333.44]  And for three days and three nights, Jonah was in the great fish.
[3334.04 --> 3336.26]  That fish carried him back to the coast.
[3336.78 --> 3341.94]  Jonah in there prayed, and he was commissioned again to go to the Ninevites.
[3341.94 --> 3343.58]  He goes to the Ninevites.
[3344.08 --> 3346.92]  He laxadaisically preaches to them.
[3347.56 --> 3349.24]  We looked at that last week.
[3349.88 --> 3351.08]  And they respond.
[3351.76 --> 3358.42]  And they respond in confession and in repentance from the least of the citizens to the greatest,
[3358.98 --> 3360.28]  to the king himself.
[3361.56 --> 3364.72]  And therefore, we read at the end of chapter 3,
[3364.72 --> 3369.80]  when God saw what they did and how they turned from their evil ways, he relented and did not
[3369.80 --> 3372.88]  bring on them the destruction that he had threatened.
[3374.42 --> 3379.00]  And to Jonah, this seemed very wrong, and he became very angry.
[3379.00 --> 3384.96]  He prayed to the Lord, isn't this what I said, Lord, when I was still home?
[3385.56 --> 3388.70]  That is why I tried to forestall by fleeing to Tarshish.
[3389.28 --> 3396.20]  I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abounding in love,
[3396.30 --> 3398.68]  a God who relents from sending calamity.
[3399.16 --> 3406.38]  Now, Lord, take away my life, for it is better for me to die than to live.
[3406.38 --> 3410.16]  But the Lord replied,
[3410.72 --> 3413.40]  Is it right for you to be angry?
[3415.86 --> 3419.44]  Jonah had gone out and sat down at a place east of the city.
[3420.42 --> 3426.68]  There he made himself a shelter, sat in its shade, and waited to see what would happen to the city.
[3427.88 --> 3434.02]  Then the Lord provided a leafy plant and made it grow up over Jonah to give shade for his head
[3434.02 --> 3438.28]  to ease his discomfort, and Jonah was very happy about the plant.
[3439.86 --> 3446.44]  But at dawn the next day, God provided a worm, which chewed the plant so that it withered.
[3447.14 --> 3454.86]  And when the sun rose, God provided a scorching east wind, and the sun blazed on Jonah's head so that he grew faint.
[3455.72 --> 3458.16]  He wanted to die and said,
[3458.16 --> 3461.24]  It would be better for me to die than to live.
[3462.58 --> 3463.96]  But God said to Jonah,
[3464.68 --> 3467.74]  Is it right for you to be angry about the plant?
[3469.48 --> 3470.70]  But the Lord said,
[3471.12 --> 3472.16]  Or it is, he said,
[3472.48 --> 3474.68]  And I'm so angry I wish I were dead.
[3475.62 --> 3476.82]  But the Lord said,
[3477.60 --> 3480.24]  You have been concerned about this plant,
[3480.80 --> 3483.72]  though you did not tend it or make it grow.
[3483.72 --> 3486.50]  It sprang up overnight and died overnight.
[3487.50 --> 3491.44]  And should I not have concern for the great city of Nineveh,
[3491.78 --> 3498.16]  in which there are more than 120,000 people who cannot tell their right hand from their left,
[3498.44 --> 3500.58]  and also many animals.
[3501.74 --> 3503.08]  This is the word of the Lord.
[3503.08 --> 3516.28]  I'm not sure if I have shared this particular story from the stage here.
[3516.36 --> 3520.22]  I know that I've written about it, and in some of the classes I've taught, I've talked about it.
[3521.58 --> 3523.56]  But when I was in seminary,
[3524.64 --> 3526.66]  it was in my final year of seminary,
[3526.66 --> 3533.18]  I went through a really deep and dark time.
[3534.74 --> 3538.68]  I went through a really hard crisis of faith.
[3539.96 --> 3544.88]  There I was studying the Bible and theology and philosophy,
[3545.66 --> 3548.88]  and for a period of about four months,
[3548.88 --> 3553.10]  I refused to believe any of it.
[3554.70 --> 3561.54]  And I got rather angry with this idea of God.
[3562.64 --> 3568.66]  And I got rather angry with the people around me in my life
[3568.66 --> 3571.76]  who tried to help me and walk with me.
[3571.76 --> 3577.16]  It was a period of time
[3577.16 --> 3579.44]  where I wasn't sure
[3579.44 --> 3581.64]  what to believe
[3581.64 --> 3583.18]  or how to believe
[3583.18 --> 3585.50]  or if I even ever could
[3585.50 --> 3586.66]  believe again.
[3587.72 --> 3589.44]  It was a period of time where
[3589.44 --> 3593.26]  I mean, to be fair to my
[3593.26 --> 3595.46]  friends and to my wife who was with me
[3595.46 --> 3596.10]  in that moment,
[3596.80 --> 3599.34]  I wasn't the nicest guy.
[3599.86 --> 3601.72]  There's a better word for it, but I'm not going to use it
[3601.72 --> 3602.64]  because we're live streaming.
[3607.06 --> 3609.66]  And I struggled a lot.
[3610.06 --> 3612.42]  And I was angry a lot.
[3612.98 --> 3614.24]  And what was happening
[3614.24 --> 3619.08]  is that my ideas about God
[3619.08 --> 3621.28]  were being challenged
[3621.28 --> 3623.36]  not only by the things that I was reading,
[3623.54 --> 3625.18]  but by the conversations that I was having
[3625.18 --> 3627.22]  and by the questions that I was asking.
[3627.70 --> 3629.86]  And I didn't like
[3629.86 --> 3634.42]  where those questions were taking me.
[3634.82 --> 3636.42]  I didn't like
[3636.42 --> 3638.44]  these conclusions about God
[3638.44 --> 3639.96]  that I was coming to.
[3640.12 --> 3640.86]  And so instead,
[3641.88 --> 3643.48]  I just ran away.
[3647.20 --> 3647.72]  Now,
[3647.92 --> 3649.36]  long story short,
[3649.52 --> 3650.66]  by the grace of God,
[3650.92 --> 3653.42]  through the community of people around me,
[3653.46 --> 3654.56]  He never let me go.
[3654.56 --> 3657.06]  And He called me back to Himself.
[3660.20 --> 3660.72]  But,
[3660.78 --> 3662.36]  what I
[3662.36 --> 3664.58]  experienced in that
[3664.58 --> 3665.18]  moment,
[3665.34 --> 3666.96]  and what hopefully I have learned
[3666.96 --> 3668.54]  and am continuing to learn
[3668.54 --> 3669.92]  through that process,
[3670.66 --> 3672.50]  is that how we
[3672.50 --> 3674.58]  respond when our
[3674.58 --> 3676.54]  ideas about who God
[3676.54 --> 3678.80]  is and what God is doing in the world
[3678.80 --> 3680.08]  or what God should do
[3680.08 --> 3680.90]  in the world,
[3680.90 --> 3682.82]  when our ideas about God
[3682.82 --> 3683.86]  are challenged,
[3684.36 --> 3686.36]  how we respond
[3686.36 --> 3687.94]  matters.
[3689.70 --> 3690.30]  Especially
[3690.30 --> 3692.36]  when they're challenged
[3692.36 --> 3693.42]  by God Himself.
[3695.90 --> 3697.30]  And that's where we're going to start
[3697.30 --> 3699.20]  in this last chapter
[3699.20 --> 3700.54]  of Jonah.
[3702.14 --> 3703.12]  Verse 1
[3703.12 --> 3704.28]  tells us, right,
[3704.38 --> 3706.36]  that Jonah didn't like
[3706.36 --> 3708.30]  God relenting.
[3709.06 --> 3710.16]  Jonah didn't like
[3710.16 --> 3711.08]  that God
[3711.08 --> 3711.92]  did not bring
[3711.92 --> 3712.68]  the destruction
[3712.68 --> 3713.84]  upon Nineveh
[3713.84 --> 3716.20]  that He said He would.
[3717.08 --> 3718.60]  But it's even more
[3718.60 --> 3720.02]  than not liking.
[3720.76 --> 3720.88]  Right?
[3720.94 --> 3722.06]  It goes even deeper
[3722.06 --> 3722.50]  than that.
[3722.68 --> 3723.30]  What did we read?
[3723.34 --> 3723.56]  It says,
[3723.92 --> 3724.48]  to Jonah,
[3724.86 --> 3725.82]  it seemed
[3725.82 --> 3727.64]  very wrong.
[3729.68 --> 3730.68]  To Jonah,
[3730.92 --> 3732.12]  from Jonah's perspective,
[3732.38 --> 3733.32]  what God did
[3733.32 --> 3734.12]  in that moment
[3734.12 --> 3735.38]  was actually
[3735.38 --> 3736.56]  unjust.
[3738.30 --> 3739.74]  It wasn't right.
[3740.38 --> 3741.70]  To Jonah's mind,
[3741.80 --> 3743.24]  it doesn't make any sense.
[3745.08 --> 3745.18]  Right?
[3745.24 --> 3746.10]  Jonah is sitting there
[3746.10 --> 3746.64]  in his anger.
[3746.76 --> 3747.02]  He's like,
[3747.06 --> 3747.64]  how could God
[3747.64 --> 3748.34]  let them get away
[3748.34 --> 3748.84]  with that?
[3750.92 --> 3752.32]  Why do evil men
[3752.32 --> 3752.92]  prosper
[3752.92 --> 3753.78]  while good men
[3753.78 --> 3754.16]  suffer?
[3755.76 --> 3756.78]  Why would God
[3756.78 --> 3757.76]  let that happen?
[3760.58 --> 3760.92]  Now,
[3761.76 --> 3762.72]  I don't know about you,
[3763.42 --> 3764.40]  but I've got some
[3764.40 --> 3765.18]  empathy for Jonah
[3765.18 --> 3765.82]  in that moment.
[3765.82 --> 3767.70]  Right?
[3768.58 --> 3769.46]  It's really
[3769.46 --> 3770.22]  not hard
[3770.22 --> 3770.62]  for me
[3770.62 --> 3771.70]  to see
[3771.70 --> 3772.70]  why he's
[3772.70 --> 3773.40]  angry.
[3774.56 --> 3775.14]  Because
[3775.14 --> 3776.62]  Jonah's idea
[3776.62 --> 3777.72]  of God,
[3778.32 --> 3779.30]  of who God
[3779.30 --> 3779.76]  is,
[3779.88 --> 3780.76]  and of what God
[3780.76 --> 3781.90]  is supposed to do
[3781.90 --> 3782.74]  in the world
[3782.74 --> 3783.62]  is being
[3783.62 --> 3785.14]  directly challenged.
[3786.82 --> 3787.32]  Now,
[3787.38 --> 3788.28]  in Jonah's case,
[3788.78 --> 3788.94]  right,
[3788.98 --> 3789.72]  his ideas
[3789.72 --> 3790.46]  about God
[3790.46 --> 3791.56]  are being challenged
[3791.56 --> 3792.68]  by God himself.
[3792.68 --> 3794.74]  right,
[3794.78 --> 3795.52]  by God's own
[3795.52 --> 3796.62]  action in the world.
[3798.42 --> 3799.60]  For you and me,
[3800.60 --> 3801.60]  for us,
[3802.04 --> 3803.52]  it's not always
[3803.52 --> 3804.20]  as obvious.
[3806.72 --> 3807.00]  And so,
[3807.08 --> 3807.48]  for instance,
[3808.26 --> 3809.14]  sometimes
[3809.14 --> 3810.72]  our ideas
[3810.72 --> 3811.46]  about God
[3811.46 --> 3812.42]  are challenged
[3812.42 --> 3814.22]  when people
[3814.22 --> 3816.16]  we think
[3816.16 --> 3817.38]  should believe
[3817.38 --> 3818.02]  in him
[3818.02 --> 3819.34]  don't
[3819.34 --> 3820.20]  believe
[3820.20 --> 3820.60]  in him.
[3822.08 --> 3822.22]  Right?
[3822.24 --> 3822.66]  For instance,
[3822.78 --> 3823.30]  maybe you have
[3823.30 --> 3824.96]  some group
[3824.96 --> 3825.34]  of friends.
[3825.44 --> 3825.80]  Maybe there's
[3825.80 --> 3826.46]  five of you.
[3827.18 --> 3827.42]  Right?
[3827.46 --> 3828.16]  You all grew up
[3828.16 --> 3828.66]  in church,
[3829.14 --> 3830.26]  but now
[3830.26 --> 3831.90]  only two of them
[3831.90 --> 3832.92]  still say
[3832.92 --> 3833.52]  they're Christian.
[3835.22 --> 3836.00]  Or maybe
[3836.00 --> 3836.74]  it's your kids.
[3837.88 --> 3838.10]  Right?
[3838.16 --> 3839.08]  Why would God
[3839.08 --> 3839.98]  let two of them
[3839.98 --> 3840.64]  walk away
[3840.64 --> 3841.50]  and one
[3841.50 --> 3842.52]  stay in the church?
[3845.32 --> 3846.14]  These challenge
[3846.14 --> 3846.56]  our ideas
[3846.56 --> 3847.10]  about God.
[3848.16 --> 3849.14]  Maybe your ideas
[3849.14 --> 3849.68]  about God
[3849.68 --> 3850.42]  are challenged
[3850.42 --> 3851.46]  because you
[3851.46 --> 3851.86]  went away
[3851.86 --> 3852.48]  to university
[3852.48 --> 3853.58]  and you met
[3853.58 --> 3854.34]  a bunch of people
[3854.34 --> 3855.88]  that you really like
[3855.88 --> 3857.32]  and those people
[3857.32 --> 3858.00]  that you really like,
[3858.10 --> 3858.58]  they think
[3858.58 --> 3859.22]  being Christian
[3859.22 --> 3860.14]  is kind of silly
[3860.14 --> 3861.16]  and backwards.
[3862.48 --> 3862.72]  Right?
[3862.80 --> 3863.78]  They're the people
[3863.78 --> 3864.14]  who say,
[3864.32 --> 3865.84]  why would you get up
[3865.84 --> 3866.10]  at,
[3866.98 --> 3867.24]  you know,
[3867.36 --> 3868.64]  early on Sunday morning
[3868.64 --> 3869.84]  to go to church?
[3870.32 --> 3870.86]  They think
[3870.86 --> 3871.70]  it's a waste of time.
[3873.10 --> 3873.30]  Right?
[3873.36 --> 3874.02]  These are the people
[3874.02 --> 3874.94]  that your parents
[3874.94 --> 3876.04]  and your youth pastor
[3876.04 --> 3876.98]  warned you about,
[3877.18 --> 3878.16]  but you love them.
[3879.64 --> 3880.82]  They're good people.
[3882.00 --> 3882.56]  And so now,
[3882.64 --> 3883.16]  all of a sudden,
[3883.26 --> 3884.74]  your ideas about God
[3884.74 --> 3886.36]  are being challenged
[3886.36 --> 3888.94]  because of your interactions
[3888.94 --> 3890.20]  with them.
[3892.72 --> 3894.02]  Maybe you just met
[3894.02 --> 3894.70]  your new neighbors
[3894.70 --> 3897.20]  and it's a gay couple
[3897.20 --> 3898.92]  that have kids
[3898.92 --> 3899.96]  the same age as yours
[3899.96 --> 3902.00]  and they're lovely.
[3904.64 --> 3904.84]  Right?
[3905.24 --> 3906.30]  Sometimes we end up
[3906.30 --> 3907.06]  in circumstances
[3907.06 --> 3908.04]  that challenge
[3908.04 --> 3909.16]  our ideas
[3909.16 --> 3910.24]  about who God is.
[3911.48 --> 3912.38]  Maybe it's you.
[3913.90 --> 3915.08]  Maybe it's someone you love
[3915.08 --> 3917.54]  and you just don't know
[3917.54 --> 3918.26]  what to do
[3918.26 --> 3919.62]  in that moment.
[3921.46 --> 3921.58]  Right?
[3921.58 --> 3922.92]  Maybe it's a crisis of faith
[3922.92 --> 3923.80]  and you don't know
[3923.80 --> 3924.44]  what to believe.
[3925.32 --> 3926.42]  The point is,
[3926.56 --> 3928.34]  we all have ideas
[3928.34 --> 3929.78]  about who God is
[3929.78 --> 3931.38]  and about what He should do
[3931.38 --> 3932.66]  and what we should do
[3932.66 --> 3933.84]  in response to that.
[3934.12 --> 3934.28]  Right?
[3934.32 --> 3935.24]  About who God is
[3935.24 --> 3936.74]  or who God isn't.
[3936.94 --> 3938.12]  What He should let happen.
[3938.86 --> 3940.74]  And unless our heads
[3940.74 --> 3941.44]  are buried
[3941.44 --> 3942.94]  in the proverbial sand,
[3943.18 --> 3944.00]  there will be
[3944.00 --> 3945.30]  a time and a place
[3945.30 --> 3946.56]  where those ideas
[3946.56 --> 3947.28]  about God
[3947.28 --> 3947.88]  are challenged.
[3949.50 --> 3950.44]  And yes,
[3950.60 --> 3951.30]  like Jonah,
[3952.06 --> 3953.78]  sometimes those ideas
[3953.78 --> 3954.60]  are challenged
[3954.60 --> 3955.58]  by God Himself
[3955.58 --> 3957.30]  because we've given
[3957.30 --> 3958.22]  ourselves over
[3958.22 --> 3959.70]  to the wrong notion
[3959.70 --> 3960.28]  of God.
[3961.16 --> 3961.30]  Right?
[3961.34 --> 3962.38]  But it's also true
[3962.38 --> 3963.24]  that every time
[3963.24 --> 3964.42]  those ideas are challenged,
[3964.56 --> 3966.24]  God will and can use them.
[3967.24 --> 3968.70]  But most often,
[3969.36 --> 3971.12]  our ideas of God,
[3971.22 --> 3972.12]  it seems to me,
[3972.22 --> 3973.52]  are challenged
[3973.52 --> 3975.08]  by our own life,
[3975.24 --> 3976.44]  by our own circumstances,
[3976.64 --> 3977.58]  by the people we know,
[3977.58 --> 3978.76]  the people we love,
[3979.00 --> 3979.80]  the people we meet,
[3980.10 --> 3980.96]  and by the culture
[3980.96 --> 3981.92]  around us,
[3981.96 --> 3983.30]  the culture we find
[3983.30 --> 3983.96]  ourselves in.
[3984.96 --> 3985.82]  And so the questions
[3985.82 --> 3987.60]  that we need to ask ourselves,
[3987.80 --> 3988.96]  the wrestling
[3988.96 --> 3989.96]  that we need to do
[3989.96 --> 3990.40]  is,
[3990.80 --> 3992.34]  are your ideas of God
[3992.34 --> 3993.16]  being challenged
[3993.16 --> 3994.94]  because you've made God
[3994.94 --> 3995.96]  something He's not?
[3997.10 --> 3997.74]  Or,
[3998.00 --> 3999.50]  are your ideas of God
[3999.50 --> 4000.32]  being challenged
[4000.32 --> 4002.50]  because you've made culture
[4002.50 --> 4003.88]  something it's not?
[4004.62 --> 4005.26]  Or,
[4005.58 --> 4007.08]  are your ideas of God
[4007.08 --> 4007.84]  being challenged
[4007.84 --> 4009.36]  because you've made
[4009.36 --> 4010.78]  something or someone
[4010.78 --> 4012.36]  other than God,
[4012.36 --> 4013.70]  the God of the Bible,
[4014.08 --> 4016.10]  true and more true
[4016.10 --> 4017.48]  and authoritative
[4017.48 --> 4018.76]  in your life?
[4020.32 --> 4020.52]  Now,
[4020.92 --> 4021.24]  I get,
[4021.64 --> 4022.70]  especially for me
[4022.70 --> 4023.68]  standing up on the stage
[4023.68 --> 4024.60]  spouting these questions
[4024.60 --> 4024.86]  at you,
[4024.94 --> 4026.60]  these aren't easy questions
[4026.60 --> 4027.44]  to answer.
[4028.64 --> 4030.76]  And this kind of introspection,
[4031.06 --> 4031.28]  right,
[4031.32 --> 4032.46]  that we're talking about here
[4032.46 --> 4034.10]  isn't done easily
[4034.10 --> 4035.70]  and it isn't done
[4035.70 --> 4037.48]  well alone.
[4037.48 --> 4040.98]  but I want to suggest
[4040.98 --> 4041.42]  to you
[4041.42 --> 4042.50]  that,
[4042.60 --> 4044.52]  that most of the time
[4044.52 --> 4046.14]  when we get angry
[4046.14 --> 4047.24]  or upset
[4047.24 --> 4048.54]  or confused
[4048.54 --> 4050.32]  by what God is doing
[4050.32 --> 4052.22]  or what God is letting happen,
[4052.58 --> 4053.20]  it's because
[4053.20 --> 4055.32]  we're doing this last thing.
[4056.32 --> 4056.56]  Right?
[4056.60 --> 4057.52]  When your idea
[4057.52 --> 4058.56]  of who God is
[4058.56 --> 4059.64]  is being challenged
[4059.64 --> 4061.44]  in your life,
[4061.48 --> 4062.46]  it's most likely
[4062.46 --> 4064.16]  because you've made
[4064.16 --> 4065.68]  something other than
[4065.68 --> 4066.98]  the God of the Bible
[4066.98 --> 4068.28]  as more true
[4068.28 --> 4070.20]  or more authoritative
[4070.20 --> 4071.90]  in your life.
[4079.02 --> 4080.42]  Peter prayed
[4080.42 --> 4081.48]  to this effect.
[4082.68 --> 4083.96]  In the world today,
[4084.62 --> 4086.12]  if it doesn't make sense
[4086.12 --> 4086.78]  to me,
[4087.68 --> 4089.06]  then it can't make sense.
[4090.38 --> 4091.58]  For people today,
[4091.58 --> 4093.02]  what is good
[4093.02 --> 4094.02]  is linked
[4094.02 --> 4095.80]  to what gives me joy.
[4096.28 --> 4098.08]  And if it makes me feel happy
[4098.08 --> 4099.04]  or safe
[4099.04 --> 4100.18]  or less anxious,
[4100.46 --> 4101.94]  then it must be good.
[4103.10 --> 4103.78]  And moreover,
[4103.94 --> 4105.04]  there's this idea
[4105.04 --> 4105.78]  that comes along
[4105.78 --> 4106.18]  and says
[4106.18 --> 4108.08]  that only I
[4108.08 --> 4108.88]  can say
[4108.88 --> 4110.06]  what is good
[4110.06 --> 4111.30]  for me.
[4112.18 --> 4113.02]  And then with that,
[4113.10 --> 4113.92]  if I say
[4113.92 --> 4114.68]  that it is good
[4114.68 --> 4115.26]  for me,
[4115.50 --> 4117.20]  you have to affirm it
[4117.20 --> 4118.06]  as such.
[4118.06 --> 4120.08]  If you don't,
[4120.58 --> 4122.14]  you are an unsafe person.
[4123.74 --> 4124.00]  Now,
[4124.18 --> 4125.26]  let me be careful
[4125.26 --> 4125.66]  because
[4125.66 --> 4127.32]  I'm going to be blunt
[4127.32 --> 4127.72]  with you.
[4128.00 --> 4128.88]  Some of us
[4128.88 --> 4130.22]  are just jerks.
[4131.52 --> 4131.64]  Right?
[4131.68 --> 4132.10]  Some of us
[4132.10 --> 4133.70]  are unsafe people
[4133.70 --> 4134.74]  that we don't know
[4134.74 --> 4135.10]  how to have
[4135.10 --> 4136.00]  these kinds of conversations.
[4136.16 --> 4136.44]  We don't know
[4136.44 --> 4136.82]  how to enter
[4136.82 --> 4138.04]  into them well.
[4140.10 --> 4142.28]  But asking hard questions
[4142.28 --> 4144.46]  is not itself
[4144.46 --> 4145.70]  unsafe.
[4146.22 --> 4147.38]  Asking questions
[4147.38 --> 4148.64]  in today's world
[4148.64 --> 4149.60]  is sometimes seen
[4149.60 --> 4151.20]  as an act of violence.
[4152.94 --> 4154.30]  But that's because
[4154.30 --> 4156.70]  we have made ourselves
[4156.70 --> 4158.44]  the only
[4158.44 --> 4160.32]  or the final authority
[4160.32 --> 4161.92]  on ourselves.
[4163.18 --> 4164.06]  No one,
[4164.30 --> 4165.48]  not even God,
[4165.76 --> 4166.82]  can get in the way
[4166.82 --> 4168.74]  of my self-identification.
[4169.86 --> 4170.56]  And then,
[4170.66 --> 4171.58]  when you brush up
[4171.58 --> 4172.40]  against that,
[4172.64 --> 4173.66]  whether it's in yourself
[4173.66 --> 4174.72]  or in conversation
[4174.72 --> 4175.68]  with a friend
[4175.68 --> 4176.34]  or a neighbor
[4176.34 --> 4177.84]  or someone you love,
[4178.06 --> 4179.00]  our ideas
[4179.00 --> 4180.44]  about who God is
[4180.44 --> 4181.44]  get challenged.
[4183.76 --> 4184.56]  And again,
[4184.72 --> 4185.56]  we're being candid
[4185.56 --> 4186.42]  together this morning.
[4186.84 --> 4186.94]  Right?
[4187.02 --> 4188.10]  When that happens,
[4188.26 --> 4189.72]  the easy thing to do
[4189.72 --> 4191.18]  is to run away.
[4192.48 --> 4193.56]  That's what Jonah did.
[4194.68 --> 4194.88]  Right?
[4194.92 --> 4195.32]  He said,
[4195.42 --> 4195.70]  again,
[4195.78 --> 4196.22]  in our text,
[4196.30 --> 4196.52]  he said,
[4196.78 --> 4197.72]  isn't that what I said
[4197.72 --> 4198.68]  while I was still home?
[4198.82 --> 4199.82]  That's why I fled
[4199.82 --> 4200.46]  to Tarshish.
[4203.24 --> 4203.72]  Nope.
[4204.90 --> 4205.72]  Maybe you're not
[4205.72 --> 4207.26]  as familiar with this
[4207.26 --> 4209.22]  in the world today
[4209.22 --> 4210.32]  as I am.
[4211.14 --> 4212.26]  But maybe also,
[4212.38 --> 4213.12]  you're here this morning
[4213.12 --> 4214.00]  and you're living it.
[4214.80 --> 4215.72]  But right now,
[4215.80 --> 4216.50]  in our world,
[4216.64 --> 4218.96]  there are a lot of people,
[4219.16 --> 4220.48]  and primarily young people,
[4220.54 --> 4221.68]  but not exclusively so,
[4221.76 --> 4222.74]  there are a lot of people
[4222.74 --> 4223.76]  who are doing
[4223.76 --> 4224.20]  what's called
[4224.20 --> 4225.70]  deconstructing
[4225.70 --> 4227.10]  their faith.
[4227.10 --> 4229.42]  A lot of people
[4229.42 --> 4230.84]  are asking questions
[4230.84 --> 4232.82]  and then just walking away.
[4233.74 --> 4235.68]  In the evangelical world,
[4236.06 --> 4237.34]  we call this
[4237.34 --> 4238.62]  the process of becoming
[4238.62 --> 4240.12]  an ex-vangelical.
[4242.00 --> 4242.24]  Right?
[4242.30 --> 4243.40]  And often it comes
[4243.40 --> 4244.60]  from a circumstance
[4244.60 --> 4245.90]  like we've already mentioned,
[4246.02 --> 4246.18]  right,
[4246.22 --> 4247.60]  where maybe the bubble
[4247.60 --> 4248.90]  of your Christian upbringing
[4248.90 --> 4249.64]  is popped
[4249.64 --> 4251.24]  when you go away
[4251.24 --> 4252.48]  to university
[4252.48 --> 4253.30]  or you move out
[4253.30 --> 4254.14]  or you get a job.
[4254.24 --> 4254.48]  And then,
[4254.54 --> 4254.92]  surprise,
[4255.90 --> 4257.08]  there's people there
[4257.08 --> 4257.66]  that you like.
[4258.52 --> 4259.50]  They're not fools.
[4259.90 --> 4260.90]  They're not licentious,
[4261.04 --> 4262.14]  depraved animals.
[4262.40 --> 4262.94]  They're fun
[4262.94 --> 4264.28]  and they like you
[4264.28 --> 4265.56]  and they don't judge you.
[4265.84 --> 4266.90]  And then behind that
[4266.90 --> 4268.20]  is a desire
[4268.20 --> 4269.62]  that is seeking justification
[4269.62 --> 4270.62]  for expression
[4270.62 --> 4272.12]  and then the journey
[4272.12 --> 4274.24]  of deconstruction begins.
[4275.46 --> 4276.48]  And so you go on YouTube
[4276.48 --> 4277.40]  or Discord
[4277.40 --> 4278.46]  or Reddit
[4278.46 --> 4279.36]  and then you find
[4279.36 --> 4280.40]  a community of people
[4280.40 --> 4281.66]  who are doing the same thing,
[4281.72 --> 4282.76]  who feel the same way,
[4282.86 --> 4284.44]  and they affirm that in you
[4284.44 --> 4285.72]  because they need
[4285.72 --> 4286.90]  that same affirmation
[4286.90 --> 4287.48]  for the journey
[4287.48 --> 4288.28]  that they're on.
[4288.50 --> 4289.66]  And then after that,
[4289.74 --> 4289.94]  right,
[4290.00 --> 4290.86]  it always happens
[4290.86 --> 4292.06]  that you get this group
[4292.06 --> 4292.44]  of people
[4292.44 --> 4293.40]  who have surrounded you
[4293.40 --> 4294.10]  in this process
[4294.10 --> 4295.52]  and then they celebrate
[4295.52 --> 4297.58]  your work of deconstruction.
[4298.48 --> 4299.24]  That's what's happening
[4299.24 --> 4299.98]  in the culture today.
[4300.10 --> 4301.54]  There's this celebration
[4301.54 --> 4303.86]  because you've individuated
[4303.86 --> 4305.00]  and differentiated
[4305.00 --> 4306.26]  your parents' faith
[4306.26 --> 4306.86]  and the faith
[4306.86 --> 4308.10]  of that stodgy old pastor
[4308.10 --> 4309.44]  that you grew up with
[4309.44 --> 4311.62]  and now you have figured it out.
[4311.62 --> 4313.46]  You're better off.
[4314.28 --> 4314.88]  Except,
[4316.48 --> 4321.02]  deconstruction isn't hard work.
[4322.36 --> 4323.24]  It's not.
[4323.84 --> 4324.84]  I'm going to suggest to you
[4324.84 --> 4325.44]  that that's actually
[4325.44 --> 4326.54]  the easy way out.
[4328.12 --> 4329.40]  Don't buy the lie
[4329.40 --> 4331.04]  that is then celebrated
[4331.04 --> 4332.48]  because it's easy
[4332.48 --> 4333.78]  to slide away.
[4335.02 --> 4335.50]  In fact,
[4335.56 --> 4337.44]  there's probably not anything easier
[4337.44 --> 4339.54]  because it's the natural direction
[4339.54 --> 4342.22]  of gravity in our faith lives.
[4342.34 --> 4344.02]  Moving from belief to unbelief
[4344.02 --> 4345.38]  doesn't take much work
[4345.38 --> 4347.84]  and isn't honestly worth celebrating.
[4348.18 --> 4348.58]  Instead,
[4349.12 --> 4350.38]  and this won't surprise any of you,
[4350.64 --> 4352.16]  but what I'm more interested in,
[4353.38 --> 4355.70]  what I think is worth celebrating
[4355.70 --> 4360.08]  is that when we move towards belief,
[4360.82 --> 4362.70]  when our ideas of who God is
[4362.70 --> 4363.84]  and what He should do in the world
[4363.84 --> 4364.92]  are challenged.
[4365.92 --> 4367.30]  That's the real work.
[4367.84 --> 4369.10]  That's the real opportunity
[4369.10 --> 4370.38]  for celebration.
[4371.98 --> 4372.24]  And look,
[4372.30 --> 4373.42]  I know a lot of you
[4373.42 --> 4374.40]  are here this morning
[4374.40 --> 4375.80]  who are young adults.
[4375.94 --> 4377.34]  You've come back from university,
[4377.76 --> 4377.92]  right?
[4378.00 --> 4380.10]  And a lot of you
[4380.10 --> 4381.36]  are here
[4381.36 --> 4382.52]  who've recently
[4382.52 --> 4384.46]  entered the professional world.
[4385.34 --> 4387.04]  And a lot of you
[4387.04 --> 4387.94]  here this morning
[4387.94 --> 4390.44]  are living in this dynamic
[4390.44 --> 4391.38]  right now.
[4392.26 --> 4394.32]  Your ideas about God
[4394.32 --> 4395.94]  are being challenged.
[4395.94 --> 4399.12]  And part of what we do here
[4399.12 --> 4400.26]  in our worship together,
[4400.26 --> 4401.84]  in our community of faith
[4401.84 --> 4402.82]  and discipleship,
[4402.82 --> 4405.32]  is to challenge your ideas
[4405.32 --> 4406.34]  that are being challenged
[4406.34 --> 4409.08]  and to test them against scriptures
[4409.08 --> 4410.04]  and to make sure
[4410.04 --> 4411.78]  that they accurately reflect
[4411.78 --> 4412.98]  who God is.
[4413.04 --> 4413.84]  Because, yes,
[4413.92 --> 4415.08]  our ideas of God
[4415.08 --> 4415.80]  may be challenged,
[4416.00 --> 4417.36]  but God can use
[4417.36 --> 4419.24]  those challenging ideas.
[4419.24 --> 4420.44]  and your theology
[4420.44 --> 4421.50]  about God
[4421.50 --> 4422.74]  must connect
[4422.74 --> 4424.54]  to the ontology
[4424.54 --> 4426.22]  you have of God.
[4426.36 --> 4426.80]  That is,
[4426.94 --> 4428.40]  what you think about God,
[4428.46 --> 4429.38]  the ideas you have,
[4429.44 --> 4430.44]  need to reflect
[4430.44 --> 4431.40]  the reality
[4431.40 --> 4432.74]  of who God is.
[4434.06 --> 4434.16]  Right?
[4434.24 --> 4436.02]  And better than running away
[4436.02 --> 4437.46]  when we have hard questions
[4437.46 --> 4439.58]  is pressing into worship,
[4440.02 --> 4441.24]  is pressing into community.
[4442.40 --> 4443.38]  Better than running away
[4443.38 --> 4445.68]  is digging into our faith
[4445.68 --> 4447.44]  with a community of people
[4447.44 --> 4449.24]  who are walking
[4449.24 --> 4450.30]  that same journey
[4450.30 --> 4451.44]  with you.
[4455.06 --> 4456.22]  In the story
[4456.22 --> 4457.80]  that we read
[4457.80 --> 4458.68]  in Jonah,
[4459.98 --> 4461.94]  Jonah's theology
[4461.94 --> 4463.80]  of who God is
[4463.80 --> 4465.68]  doesn't match up
[4465.68 --> 4466.94]  with who God is
[4466.94 --> 4467.86]  in reality.
[4469.18 --> 4469.52]  Now,
[4470.04 --> 4471.36]  Jonah knows,
[4471.42 --> 4473.38]  at least he can state
[4473.38 --> 4475.18]  what he should believe
[4475.18 --> 4476.16]  and think,
[4476.94 --> 4478.32]  but he doesn't actually
[4478.32 --> 4479.00]  believe and think
[4479.00 --> 4479.52]  those things.
[4479.70 --> 4480.88]  Look again at the text.
[4481.44 --> 4481.54]  Right?
[4481.58 --> 4481.80]  We read,
[4482.06 --> 4483.14]  it seemed very wrong
[4483.14 --> 4483.66]  to Jonah
[4483.66 --> 4484.92]  that what God did
[4484.92 --> 4485.64]  or didn't do,
[4485.74 --> 4487.00]  and so he became angry,
[4487.24 --> 4488.16]  and then he prays,
[4488.52 --> 4489.70]  isn't this what I said?
[4489.76 --> 4490.66]  This is why I fled
[4490.66 --> 4491.24]  to Tarshish.
[4491.56 --> 4492.06]  And then,
[4492.40 --> 4493.26]  perhaps in the most
[4493.26 --> 4494.14]  famous line
[4494.14 --> 4496.00]  in all of the book
[4496.00 --> 4496.62]  of Jonah,
[4497.06 --> 4497.44]  he says,
[4497.52 --> 4498.88]  I knew that you are
[4498.88 --> 4499.52]  a gracious
[4499.52 --> 4501.10]  and compassionate God,
[4501.24 --> 4502.40]  slow to anger
[4502.40 --> 4503.38]  and abounding
[4503.38 --> 4503.82]  in love,
[4503.90 --> 4504.90]  a God who relents
[4504.90 --> 4506.90]  from sending calamity.
[4509.14 --> 4510.66]  But you have to hear
[4510.66 --> 4513.16]  what Jonah is saying
[4513.16 --> 4516.10]  when he says that line,
[4516.72 --> 4518.20]  not as an item of praise,
[4518.70 --> 4521.10]  but dripping with irony.
[4523.42 --> 4523.62]  Right?
[4523.64 --> 4524.78]  This isn't spoken
[4524.78 --> 4525.56]  as something
[4525.56 --> 4527.44]  that Jonah is happy about.
[4528.24 --> 4528.48]  Right?
[4528.50 --> 4529.10]  It's true
[4529.10 --> 4530.28]  about who God is,
[4530.28 --> 4531.68]  but it's not
[4531.68 --> 4532.68]  who Jonah
[4532.68 --> 4534.06]  wants God to be.
[4536.10 --> 4537.54]  His ideas of God
[4537.54 --> 4538.48]  are being challenged,
[4538.98 --> 4540.34]  so much so
[4540.34 --> 4543.34]  that he wants to die.
[4549.52 --> 4550.48]  Now, Lord,
[4551.02 --> 4552.58]  take my life,
[4553.12 --> 4554.14]  for it is better
[4554.14 --> 4555.28]  for me to die
[4555.28 --> 4556.90]  than to live.
[4556.90 --> 4560.78]  when the source
[4560.78 --> 4561.42]  of truth
[4561.42 --> 4562.66]  in your life
[4562.66 --> 4563.82]  is something
[4563.82 --> 4564.76]  or someone
[4564.76 --> 4566.78]  other than God,
[4566.92 --> 4567.70]  when the source
[4567.70 --> 4568.52]  of authority
[4568.52 --> 4569.60]  in your being
[4569.60 --> 4571.14]  is your own heart
[4571.14 --> 4572.40]  or your own feelings,
[4572.54 --> 4573.68]  when your identity
[4573.68 --> 4574.48]  is rooted
[4574.48 --> 4575.22]  in something
[4575.22 --> 4576.00]  other than
[4576.00 --> 4577.28]  the transcendent,
[4577.62 --> 4578.70]  omnipotent God,
[4578.82 --> 4580.34]  when that is taken away,
[4581.22 --> 4582.80]  when that is challenged,
[4583.44 --> 4584.70]  or when that is found out
[4584.70 --> 4585.60]  to be inadequate
[4585.60 --> 4586.72]  or insufficient,
[4587.48 --> 4588.70]  not only can it feel
[4588.70 --> 4589.44]  like your life
[4589.44 --> 4590.08]  is over,
[4592.20 --> 4593.22]  sometimes people
[4593.22 --> 4594.44]  want it
[4594.44 --> 4596.00]  to be over.
[4599.00 --> 4599.74]  And look,
[4601.06 --> 4601.74]  if you're
[4601.74 --> 4606.56]  here this morning
[4606.56 --> 4608.38]  and you were struggling
[4608.38 --> 4609.30]  with thoughts
[4609.30 --> 4610.46]  of suicide,
[4610.72 --> 4611.36]  if you were struggling
[4611.36 --> 4612.38]  with ideas
[4612.38 --> 4613.40]  of suicide,
[4613.58 --> 4613.96]  please,
[4614.40 --> 4616.24]  know that you
[4616.24 --> 4618.26]  are not alone.
[4618.52 --> 4619.56]  Know that we
[4619.56 --> 4620.28]  are here
[4620.28 --> 4621.04]  with you
[4621.04 --> 4622.08]  and please,
[4622.24 --> 4623.36]  I plead with you,
[4623.44 --> 4624.72]  talk with someone.
[4625.36 --> 4625.44]  Right?
[4625.50 --> 4626.04]  Talk to me
[4626.04 --> 4627.50]  or to Pastor Kevin
[4627.50 --> 4628.18]  or to Josh
[4628.18 --> 4629.74]  or to your youth leaders
[4629.74 --> 4630.52]  or your friends,
[4630.68 --> 4631.62]  your care group.
[4631.78 --> 4632.98]  I don't care who,
[4633.12 --> 4634.00]  talk to someone.
[4634.80 --> 4634.90]  Right?
[4634.96 --> 4635.72]  Talk to a friend
[4635.72 --> 4636.90]  or a parent.
[4637.06 --> 4638.56]  You are not alone
[4638.56 --> 4638.98]  and no matter
[4638.98 --> 4639.82]  how big
[4639.82 --> 4640.86]  the struggle is,
[4640.90 --> 4642.16]  no matter how world-ending
[4642.16 --> 4643.56]  your crisis is,
[4643.74 --> 4644.86]  you are not alone.
[4645.02 --> 4646.42]  Let us walk with you.
[4646.52 --> 4648.10]  Let us sit with you.
[4654.78 --> 4656.82]  In my own life
[4656.82 --> 4657.70]  and ministry
[4657.70 --> 4659.68]  and in our ministry
[4659.68 --> 4660.94]  here together,
[4660.94 --> 4664.18]  there are still,
[4664.38 --> 4665.20]  there are people
[4665.20 --> 4666.86]  who are still
[4666.86 --> 4667.68]  with us
[4667.68 --> 4668.74]  now
[4668.74 --> 4671.32]  because they asked
[4671.32 --> 4671.84]  for help.
[4673.78 --> 4675.32]  Let us be your help.
[4676.80 --> 4677.32]  Please,
[4677.70 --> 4679.72]  let us be your help.
[4680.72 --> 4681.58]  You don't have to walk
[4681.58 --> 4682.06]  this
[4682.06 --> 4683.58]  alone.
[4683.58 --> 4689.80]  You are never
[4689.80 --> 4691.84]  alone.
[4698.34 --> 4699.44]  When Jonah's,
[4699.44 --> 4704.22]  when Jonah's ideas
[4704.22 --> 4704.86]  of God
[4704.86 --> 4706.62]  are challenged,
[4707.98 --> 4709.76]  God comes to him
[4709.76 --> 4711.54]  and he asks him
[4711.54 --> 4712.14]  a question.
[4713.58 --> 4714.62]  He says,
[4714.78 --> 4715.48]  is it right
[4715.48 --> 4716.10]  for you
[4716.10 --> 4717.68]  to be angry?
[4719.50 --> 4720.02]  I don't know
[4720.02 --> 4720.44]  about you,
[4720.62 --> 4721.28]  but when I read
[4721.28 --> 4721.62]  that,
[4722.06 --> 4723.06]  that seems like
[4723.06 --> 4723.68]  a really weird
[4723.68 --> 4724.14]  question
[4724.14 --> 4725.44]  in this moment.
[4725.54 --> 4725.66]  Like,
[4725.70 --> 4726.62]  Jonah has just said,
[4727.00 --> 4727.72]  it's better for me
[4727.72 --> 4728.20]  to die
[4728.20 --> 4729.38]  and God goes,
[4730.50 --> 4731.22]  should you be angry
[4731.22 --> 4731.72]  right now?
[4733.94 --> 4734.14]  Right?
[4734.16 --> 4734.86]  It seems like
[4734.86 --> 4735.86]  a strange question
[4735.86 --> 4737.72]  until we see it
[4737.72 --> 4739.18]  in the whole context
[4739.18 --> 4740.04]  of what's going on
[4740.04 --> 4740.36]  and then
[4740.36 --> 4741.56]  through that context
[4741.56 --> 4742.64]  read what I believe
[4742.64 --> 4743.56]  to be the sort
[4743.56 --> 4744.22]  of subtext
[4744.22 --> 4745.46]  of the question
[4745.46 --> 4746.64]  because what Jonah
[4746.64 --> 4748.10]  is really encountering
[4748.10 --> 4748.60]  and what God
[4748.60 --> 4750.18]  is really questioning
[4750.18 --> 4751.34]  Jonah about here
[4751.34 --> 4753.58]  is God saying
[4753.58 --> 4754.34]  to him,
[4754.46 --> 4755.34]  like God said
[4755.34 --> 4756.06]  to Job,
[4756.14 --> 4756.98]  for instance,
[4757.38 --> 4758.66]  will you let me
[4758.66 --> 4759.36]  be God
[4759.36 --> 4760.56]  in this moment?
[4762.50 --> 4763.82]  If you are unfamiliar,
[4764.04 --> 4765.02]  the story of Job
[4765.02 --> 4766.04]  is another story
[4766.04 --> 4767.04]  in the Bible
[4767.04 --> 4768.36]  and it's a story
[4768.36 --> 4768.94]  about a man
[4768.94 --> 4770.32]  who lost everything.
[4770.32 --> 4771.56]  And in fact,
[4771.62 --> 4772.52]  there was a challenge
[4772.52 --> 4774.06]  from Satan,
[4774.22 --> 4774.72]  from the devil,
[4774.92 --> 4775.58]  the deceiver,
[4775.80 --> 4776.54]  to God
[4776.54 --> 4776.90]  to say,
[4777.16 --> 4777.84]  look at Job
[4777.84 --> 4778.58]  who is righteous.
[4779.04 --> 4780.16]  If I take everything
[4780.16 --> 4780.82]  from him,
[4780.90 --> 4781.94]  he will curse God
[4781.94 --> 4782.90]  and die.
[4783.94 --> 4784.22]  Now,
[4784.30 --> 4785.20]  most scholars
[4785.20 --> 4786.10]  agree that
[4786.10 --> 4787.08]  the book of Job
[4787.08 --> 4788.54]  is one of the oldest
[4788.54 --> 4789.70]  or first written
[4789.70 --> 4790.64]  books in the Bible.
[4792.06 --> 4793.10]  And that's because
[4793.10 --> 4793.76]  it's tackling
[4793.76 --> 4795.36]  a really hard question.
[4795.48 --> 4796.46]  It's trying to make sense
[4796.46 --> 4796.92]  of a world
[4796.92 --> 4798.64]  in which there is evil.
[4798.64 --> 4800.68]  This is called theodicy.
[4801.42 --> 4802.50]  How do we understand
[4802.50 --> 4804.34]  evil in light of God?
[4804.40 --> 4805.60]  It's a way of making sense
[4805.60 --> 4807.34]  of evil in the world.
[4807.54 --> 4808.56]  And one way
[4808.56 --> 4809.42]  of phrasing
[4809.42 --> 4810.60]  this challenge,
[4810.76 --> 4811.68]  this structure,
[4811.98 --> 4812.74]  is often put
[4812.74 --> 4813.94]  something like this.
[4815.40 --> 4816.58]  If God is good
[4816.58 --> 4817.96]  and all-powerful,
[4818.22 --> 4819.10]  why then
[4819.10 --> 4819.78]  is there evil
[4819.78 --> 4820.30]  in the world?
[4821.66 --> 4822.22]  Instead,
[4822.58 --> 4823.56]  the idea goes,
[4823.96 --> 4826.12]  either God is good
[4826.12 --> 4827.86]  but not all-powerful
[4827.86 --> 4829.26]  and that makes him
[4829.26 --> 4829.88]  not God,
[4830.68 --> 4833.22]  or he is all-powerful
[4833.22 --> 4834.56]  and not good
[4834.56 --> 4836.36]  and that makes him
[4836.36 --> 4837.54]  something terrifying
[4837.54 --> 4838.38]  and evil,
[4839.94 --> 4840.08]  right?
[4840.18 --> 4840.56]  But,
[4840.64 --> 4841.64]  because there is
[4841.64 --> 4842.74]  obviously evil
[4842.74 --> 4843.58]  in the world,
[4843.90 --> 4845.28]  what God cannot be,
[4845.40 --> 4846.26]  the argument goes,
[4846.36 --> 4847.42]  is both good
[4847.42 --> 4848.90]  and all-powerful.
[4850.60 --> 4850.86]  Now,
[4851.62 --> 4852.96]  at the risk of
[4852.96 --> 4854.64]  oversimplifying
[4854.64 --> 4855.64]  a good philosophical
[4855.64 --> 4856.58]  response to this
[4856.58 --> 4857.64]  for the sake of our time
[4857.64 --> 4858.22]  together this morning
[4858.22 --> 4858.74]  because we want to
[4858.74 --> 4859.52]  come to this table,
[4860.44 --> 4861.22]  let me just say
[4861.22 --> 4863.22]  that this argument,
[4863.64 --> 4863.78]  right,
[4863.84 --> 4864.48]  this idea
[4864.48 --> 4865.64]  is an ancient one
[4865.64 --> 4866.62]  and it goes all the way
[4866.62 --> 4867.70]  back in its earliest
[4867.70 --> 4868.38]  constructions
[4868.38 --> 4869.10]  to Epicurus
[4869.10 --> 4870.42]  and it rests
[4870.42 --> 4871.66]  on the assumption
[4871.66 --> 4873.80]  that if there is
[4873.80 --> 4874.90]  a good reason
[4874.90 --> 4876.38]  for a good God,
[4876.46 --> 4877.46]  an all-powerful God,
[4877.46 --> 4878.48]  to let evil
[4878.48 --> 4879.46]  or to allow evil
[4879.46 --> 4880.20]  in the world,
[4880.64 --> 4881.74]  I should know it.
[4882.82 --> 4883.98]  Or at the very least,
[4883.98 --> 4885.00]  I should be able
[4885.00 --> 4885.90]  to figure it out.
[4888.40 --> 4888.84]  Now,
[4888.88 --> 4889.86]  in the story of Job,
[4890.00 --> 4891.00]  which is a theodicy,
[4891.14 --> 4891.44]  remember,
[4891.60 --> 4892.58]  it's written to answer
[4892.58 --> 4893.64]  this question
[4893.64 --> 4895.38]  at the very end
[4895.38 --> 4896.72]  of the book of Job.
[4896.84 --> 4897.44]  God says
[4897.44 --> 4898.84]  in this beautiful picture
[4898.84 --> 4900.00]  of who he is
[4900.00 --> 4901.06]  and what he has done,
[4901.32 --> 4901.96]  he says,
[4902.26 --> 4903.34]  standing in front of Job,
[4903.46 --> 4903.68]  right,
[4903.94 --> 4904.98]  were you there?
[4905.86 --> 4906.58]  Were you there
[4906.58 --> 4907.90]  when I created the world?
[4908.02 --> 4908.56]  Were you there
[4908.56 --> 4910.10]  when I laid its foundations?
[4910.34 --> 4910.90]  Were you there
[4910.90 --> 4911.94]  when I created
[4911.94 --> 4913.24]  the depths of the oceans
[4913.24 --> 4914.12]  and all the creatures
[4914.12 --> 4914.84]  within it?
[4914.88 --> 4915.34]  Were you there
[4915.34 --> 4916.50]  when I created the skies
[4916.50 --> 4917.34]  and all the birds
[4917.34 --> 4918.16]  that fly through it?
[4918.32 --> 4918.90]  Were you there
[4918.90 --> 4920.12]  when I cast about
[4920.12 --> 4920.98]  the stars
[4920.98 --> 4921.98]  and the planets
[4921.98 --> 4922.68]  and the heavens
[4922.68 --> 4923.70]  and made the universe?
[4924.16 --> 4924.98]  Were you there
[4924.98 --> 4926.00]  when I created
[4926.00 --> 4926.96]  the Leviathan,
[4927.44 --> 4928.20]  which coincidentally
[4928.20 --> 4928.98]  is not unlike
[4928.98 --> 4929.68]  the great fish
[4929.68 --> 4931.20]  that swallowed Jonah up.
[4931.24 --> 4931.52]  You can see
[4931.52 --> 4932.00]  these stories
[4932.00 --> 4933.10]  are tied together,
[4933.58 --> 4933.74]  right?
[4933.80 --> 4934.48]  Were you there?
[4934.62 --> 4936.24]  And Job's basic response,
[4936.46 --> 4937.26]  standing before
[4937.26 --> 4938.22]  the glorious,
[4938.42 --> 4938.98]  transcendent,
[4939.10 --> 4939.84]  majestic God,
[4939.84 --> 4940.06]  is,
[4940.42 --> 4940.72]  Amen!
[4941.44 --> 4941.82]  Amen!
[4942.46 --> 4944.20]  You are God!
[4945.76 --> 4946.90]  Job's response
[4946.90 --> 4947.64]  is to see
[4947.64 --> 4949.24]  how small he is
[4949.24 --> 4950.20]  in the presence
[4950.20 --> 4951.30]  of an omnipotent,
[4951.60 --> 4952.18]  omniscient,
[4952.58 --> 4953.66]  omnipresent God,
[4953.76 --> 4955.66]  and so he worships.
[4956.98 --> 4957.72]  Job says,
[4958.04 --> 4959.50]  I know you can do
[4959.50 --> 4960.30]  all things
[4960.30 --> 4961.26]  and no purpose
[4961.26 --> 4961.92]  of yours
[4961.92 --> 4963.38]  can be thwarted.
[4964.82 --> 4966.26]  Job is an example
[4966.26 --> 4968.24]  that when we face
[4968.24 --> 4969.72]  a crisis of faith,
[4969.84 --> 4971.20]  when we face doubts,
[4971.34 --> 4972.34]  when we face trials
[4972.34 --> 4973.14]  and tribulations
[4973.14 --> 4974.42]  on all sides,
[4974.52 --> 4975.44]  the best thing
[4975.44 --> 4976.76]  for us to do
[4976.76 --> 4978.26]  is to remember God
[4978.26 --> 4980.26]  and to worship Him.
[4982.06 --> 4983.00]  And what happens
[4983.00 --> 4984.96]  between God and Jonah
[4984.96 --> 4986.26]  in these next verses
[4986.26 --> 4988.44]  is a sort of lived parable
[4988.44 --> 4991.28]  that comes to the same conclusion
[4991.28 --> 4993.04]  as Job.
[4994.52 --> 4994.74]  Right?
[4994.74 --> 4995.42]  In his anger
[4995.42 --> 4996.42]  and in his frustration,
[4996.64 --> 4997.60]  Jonah sits down
[4997.60 --> 4998.14]  in a place
[4998.14 --> 4998.96]  east of the city.
[5000.10 --> 5000.86]  The Lord provides
[5000.86 --> 5002.34]  for him a leafy plant.
[5002.44 --> 5003.12]  We have no idea
[5003.12 --> 5004.48]  what this plant could be,
[5004.76 --> 5005.40]  but He makes it
[5005.40 --> 5006.86]  to grow up over Jonah
[5006.86 --> 5008.22]  and to give shade
[5008.22 --> 5008.88]  for his head
[5008.88 --> 5009.92]  in order to ease
[5009.92 --> 5010.84]  his discomfort,
[5011.10 --> 5011.68]  we read.
[5011.76 --> 5011.90]  Now,
[5012.08 --> 5013.78]  we read it clearly
[5013.78 --> 5015.00]  that this is
[5015.00 --> 5016.24]  a miraculous plant.
[5017.36 --> 5017.46]  Right?
[5017.48 --> 5018.46]  That God does something,
[5018.58 --> 5020.48]  He makes it to rise up
[5020.48 --> 5021.86]  and then the very next day
[5021.86 --> 5023.30]  to take it down.
[5023.30 --> 5024.40]  The plant eases
[5024.40 --> 5025.08]  his discomfort
[5025.08 --> 5026.30]  and in verse 6
[5026.30 --> 5027.06]  we read that
[5027.06 --> 5029.38]  Jonah is very happy
[5029.38 --> 5030.74]  about the plant.
[5032.82 --> 5033.98]  But as immediately
[5033.98 --> 5034.78]  as the plant
[5034.78 --> 5035.46]  rose up
[5035.46 --> 5037.70]  and caused Jonah comfort,
[5038.26 --> 5039.34]  the Lord took it away.
[5040.30 --> 5041.56]  A worm comes
[5041.56 --> 5043.16]  and chews the plant
[5043.16 --> 5044.44]  so that when the sun rises
[5044.44 --> 5045.20]  and a scorching
[5045.20 --> 5046.88]  easterly wind comes,
[5047.04 --> 5048.36]  the sun now blazes
[5048.36 --> 5049.24]  on Jonah's head
[5049.24 --> 5049.94]  so much so
[5049.94 --> 5050.86]  that he grows faint.
[5050.86 --> 5051.72]  And again,
[5051.88 --> 5052.64]  Jonah says,
[5052.78 --> 5053.58]  it would be better
[5053.58 --> 5054.72]  for me to die
[5054.72 --> 5055.84]  than to live.
[5056.38 --> 5057.30]  And so God asks him
[5057.30 --> 5058.16]  the same question.
[5059.12 --> 5060.22]  Is it right for you
[5060.22 --> 5060.88]  to be angry?
[5062.20 --> 5063.54]  And God says to Jonah,
[5064.40 --> 5064.88]  and this,
[5065.08 --> 5065.72]  I think,
[5065.82 --> 5066.78]  cuts deep
[5066.78 --> 5068.84]  in our cultural moment.
[5069.82 --> 5070.76]  God says,
[5070.88 --> 5071.40]  effectively,
[5072.34 --> 5073.72]  you linked
[5073.72 --> 5074.84]  your fortune,
[5075.12 --> 5075.70]  you linked
[5075.70 --> 5076.86]  your well-being,
[5077.08 --> 5077.76]  you linked
[5077.76 --> 5078.66]  your experience
[5078.66 --> 5079.36]  of comfort,
[5079.48 --> 5080.70]  your source of joy
[5080.70 --> 5081.62]  and happiness
[5081.62 --> 5082.64]  to something
[5082.64 --> 5083.98]  other than me.
[5085.10 --> 5085.94]  Something that you
[5085.94 --> 5087.64]  had no control over,
[5087.78 --> 5088.34]  something that you
[5088.34 --> 5090.18]  had no relationship to.
[5090.40 --> 5091.46]  And because you
[5091.46 --> 5093.22]  had put so much value
[5093.22 --> 5094.40]  into that thing
[5094.40 --> 5095.82]  when it was taken away,
[5096.02 --> 5097.20]  you felt crushed.
[5099.20 --> 5100.28]  But God is saying
[5100.28 --> 5101.18]  that leafy plant
[5101.18 --> 5103.02]  is not your savior.
[5103.02 --> 5107.06]  That self-expressed
[5107.06 --> 5107.70]  identity
[5107.70 --> 5109.92]  is not your joy.
[5110.92 --> 5112.06]  You are not
[5112.06 --> 5113.02]  your own arbiter
[5113.02 --> 5113.74]  of comfort
[5113.74 --> 5114.62]  and truth.
[5114.80 --> 5115.92]  I, the Lord,
[5116.26 --> 5117.98]  am your only
[5117.98 --> 5119.14]  comfort.
[5120.10 --> 5121.12]  I, the Lord,
[5121.26 --> 5122.96]  am your only
[5122.96 --> 5123.94]  truth.
[5126.50 --> 5127.42]  And then,
[5127.98 --> 5129.60]  in my imagination,
[5129.84 --> 5130.86]  as I read
[5130.86 --> 5131.92]  this story,
[5132.12 --> 5132.84]  I imagine
[5132.84 --> 5133.36]  the Lord
[5133.36 --> 5135.04]  looking at Jonah
[5135.04 --> 5137.80]  and saying,
[5138.80 --> 5140.10]  did I not love you?
[5141.44 --> 5143.48]  Did I not choose you?
[5143.74 --> 5145.04]  Even though you
[5145.04 --> 5146.62]  needed the same grace
[5146.62 --> 5147.88]  that was being offered
[5147.88 --> 5148.82]  to the Ninevites,
[5149.04 --> 5150.82]  did I not choose you
[5150.82 --> 5152.34]  through no part
[5152.34 --> 5153.10]  or capacity
[5153.10 --> 5154.26]  of your own?
[5154.34 --> 5155.26]  Are you not
[5155.26 --> 5156.76]  even as depraved
[5156.76 --> 5158.46]  as those Ninevites?
[5158.60 --> 5160.72]  But did I not love you?
[5160.86 --> 5161.38]  too.
[5162.52 --> 5163.90]  And if I loved you
[5163.90 --> 5164.94]  who deserved
[5164.94 --> 5166.30]  not my love,
[5166.60 --> 5167.58]  should I also
[5167.58 --> 5168.70]  not love
[5168.70 --> 5169.86]  the city of Nineveh?
[5171.22 --> 5171.98]  God is saying
[5171.98 --> 5172.46]  to Jonah,
[5172.78 --> 5173.68]  I am God.
[5173.86 --> 5174.84]  There is no other.
[5175.08 --> 5175.88]  I am God.
[5175.96 --> 5176.86]  I will not yield
[5176.86 --> 5177.58]  my glory
[5177.58 --> 5178.34]  to another.
[5178.50 --> 5179.34]  I am God,
[5179.50 --> 5179.88]  gracious
[5179.88 --> 5181.10]  and compassionate.
[5181.34 --> 5182.22]  I am God,
[5182.38 --> 5183.48]  slow to anger
[5183.48 --> 5184.58]  and abounding
[5184.58 --> 5186.16]  in love.
[5186.16 --> 5190.26]  Christian philosopher
[5190.26 --> 5191.04]  Peter Kreeft
[5191.04 --> 5192.62]  says that
[5192.62 --> 5194.52]  the Christian response
[5194.52 --> 5195.90]  to evil in the world,
[5196.00 --> 5196.90]  the Christian accounting
[5196.90 --> 5198.40]  of evil in the world,
[5198.48 --> 5199.48]  the idea that God
[5199.48 --> 5200.24]  is good
[5200.24 --> 5201.36]  and all-powerful
[5201.36 --> 5202.28]  and yet somehow
[5202.28 --> 5203.46]  has a reason
[5203.46 --> 5204.34]  to allow evil
[5204.34 --> 5205.10]  to persist,
[5206.20 --> 5207.04]  that Peter Kreeft
[5207.04 --> 5208.16]  says that this idea
[5208.90 --> 5210.14]  does not get
[5210.14 --> 5211.38]  the Christian God
[5211.38 --> 5212.46]  off the hook
[5212.46 --> 5213.50]  for evil.
[5213.50 --> 5215.00]  In fact,
[5215.12 --> 5215.88]  as Peter Kreeft
[5215.88 --> 5216.52]  puts it,
[5216.92 --> 5218.24]  God puts himself
[5218.24 --> 5219.38]  on the hook
[5219.38 --> 5220.44]  for evil
[5220.44 --> 5221.38]  in the world
[5221.38 --> 5222.34]  and that hook
[5222.34 --> 5223.34]  took the form
[5223.34 --> 5224.26]  of a cross.
[5226.14 --> 5227.58]  God took the form
[5227.58 --> 5228.60]  of a man.
[5228.88 --> 5229.28]  Jesus,
[5229.72 --> 5231.08]  God incarnate,
[5231.20 --> 5232.50]  God in the flesh
[5232.50 --> 5233.94]  came into this world
[5233.94 --> 5235.16]  and lived the life
[5235.16 --> 5235.92]  I should have lived
[5235.92 --> 5237.18]  and died the death
[5237.18 --> 5237.96]  that I deserved.
[5238.20 --> 5239.70]  He was put on that cross
[5239.70 --> 5240.82]  for my sin
[5240.82 --> 5242.02]  and for evil
[5242.02 --> 5242.76]  in the world.
[5242.76 --> 5244.28]  This is God's
[5244.28 --> 5245.46]  display of love.
[5245.84 --> 5247.26]  This is how much
[5247.26 --> 5248.94]  He loves you.
[5250.08 --> 5252.10]  He dies for you.
[5253.74 --> 5255.26]  In the words of Jonah,
[5256.28 --> 5257.18]  the calamity
[5257.18 --> 5258.58]  that was reserved
[5258.58 --> 5259.34]  for you,
[5261.28 --> 5262.60]  Jesus bore on the cross.
[5264.50 --> 5266.00]  This is the truth
[5266.00 --> 5267.00]  of who God is.
[5267.68 --> 5268.74]  And this truth
[5268.74 --> 5269.82]  about Jesus
[5269.82 --> 5270.94]  now comes
[5270.94 --> 5271.94]  with a mission.
[5272.76 --> 5274.02]  God says
[5274.02 --> 5275.04]  in verse 11
[5275.04 --> 5275.76]  of our text,
[5276.76 --> 5277.48]  says,
[5277.78 --> 5279.06]  should I not have concern
[5279.06 --> 5280.72]  for the great city
[5280.72 --> 5281.86]  of Nineveh?
[5283.24 --> 5284.24]  And so now,
[5284.36 --> 5284.72]  this morning,
[5284.80 --> 5285.62]  He asks you,
[5286.58 --> 5288.42]  should I not have concern
[5288.42 --> 5290.04]  for the neighborhood
[5290.04 --> 5290.66]  of Murrayville?
[5292.24 --> 5293.74]  Should I not have concern
[5293.74 --> 5295.90]  for Walnut Grove,
[5295.90 --> 5297.68]  for Brookswood,
[5297.68 --> 5299.06]  for Langley City,
[5299.70 --> 5300.72]  for Aldergrove,
[5300.86 --> 5301.80]  for Glen Valley,
[5302.20 --> 5302.88]  for Abbotsford?
[5303.56 --> 5305.26]  Should I not have concern
[5305.26 --> 5306.92]  for British Columbia,
[5307.30 --> 5308.06]  for Canada?
[5309.16 --> 5310.90]  Out of God's concern
[5310.90 --> 5312.06]  for these places,
[5312.40 --> 5313.88]  He sends you.
[5314.70 --> 5315.78]  He sends you
[5315.78 --> 5317.74]  as a missionary citizen
[5317.74 --> 5319.16]  into the world.
[5320.24 --> 5320.94]  A missionary
[5320.94 --> 5321.82]  to proclaim
[5321.82 --> 5322.98]  the gospel
[5322.98 --> 5324.02]  of Jesus Christ,
[5324.02 --> 5325.38]  the love of God
[5325.38 --> 5326.14]  for the world
[5326.14 --> 5326.88]  that He created,
[5327.20 --> 5328.16]  and as a citizen
[5328.16 --> 5329.30]  to reveal
[5329.30 --> 5330.48]  His kingdom come
[5330.48 --> 5332.40]  and His kingdom coming.
[5333.46 --> 5334.86]  As missionary citizens,
[5335.14 --> 5336.32]  we are called
[5336.32 --> 5338.12]  to have our ideas
[5338.12 --> 5339.58]  about God challenged,
[5340.06 --> 5340.64]  and in fact,
[5340.76 --> 5341.48]  to ensure
[5341.48 --> 5342.50]  that our ideas
[5342.50 --> 5343.08]  about God
[5343.08 --> 5343.70]  are challenged
[5343.70 --> 5344.72]  so that they might
[5344.72 --> 5345.98]  accurately reflect
[5345.98 --> 5347.62]  who God is.
[5347.62 --> 5348.98]  and then,
[5349.64 --> 5351.22]  as missionary citizens,
[5351.52 --> 5353.02]  we go into the world
[5353.02 --> 5353.58]  to challenge
[5353.58 --> 5354.54]  other people's ideas
[5354.54 --> 5356.10]  about who God is
[5356.10 --> 5358.12]  and to be used by Him
[5358.12 --> 5359.12]  to challenge
[5359.12 --> 5360.46]  those ideas.
[5360.78 --> 5361.32]  And so,
[5362.20 --> 5362.62]  go.
[5363.90 --> 5366.94]  Go as missionary citizens
[5366.94 --> 5368.38]  and worship
[5368.38 --> 5370.96]  our God.
[5371.36 --> 5372.78]  Let's pray together.
[5372.78 --> 5378.46]  Lord,
[5378.64 --> 5380.04]  our God,
[5380.88 --> 5383.60]  as we come
[5383.60 --> 5385.54]  to Your table now,
[5385.70 --> 5386.22]  we come
[5386.22 --> 5387.34]  as those
[5387.34 --> 5388.62]  who are commissioned
[5388.62 --> 5390.66]  as missionary citizens.
[5391.40 --> 5392.54]  We come
[5392.54 --> 5393.20]  as those
[5393.20 --> 5394.20]  who are called
[5394.20 --> 5395.34]  to proclaim
[5395.34 --> 5396.92]  Your gospel,
[5397.46 --> 5398.46]  to reveal
[5398.46 --> 5399.68]  Your kingdom come
[5399.68 --> 5401.68]  and Your kingdom coming.
[5401.68 --> 5402.34]  And so,
[5402.54 --> 5403.56]  use us,
[5403.80 --> 5404.40]  Lord God,
[5404.82 --> 5405.94]  to reveal
[5405.94 --> 5407.06]  Your heart
[5407.06 --> 5408.38]  for the nations.
[5409.32 --> 5410.18]  Use us,
[5410.46 --> 5410.96]  Lord God,
[5411.54 --> 5413.42]  to go into the world
[5413.42 --> 5414.28]  to proclaim
[5414.28 --> 5416.24]  Your gospel.
[5417.62 --> 5418.84]  And as we go,
[5419.10 --> 5419.62]  Lord God,
[5420.48 --> 5422.12]  as we go,
[5422.22 --> 5423.02]  we pray that You
[5423.02 --> 5423.98]  would nourish us
[5423.98 --> 5425.24]  here at this table.
[5426.10 --> 5426.88]  Take the truth
[5426.88 --> 5427.60]  of Your word
[5427.60 --> 5428.70]  that we have just heard
[5428.70 --> 5429.30]  proclaimed
[5429.30 --> 5430.34]  and that we long
[5430.34 --> 5431.00]  to live out.
[5431.00 --> 5431.84]  take that truth
[5431.84 --> 5433.32]  and make it tangible
[5433.32 --> 5434.18]  for us
[5434.18 --> 5435.66]  as we take this bread
[5435.66 --> 5436.50]  and this juice,
[5436.56 --> 5437.66]  as we take in
[5437.66 --> 5438.68]  the Lord Jesus.
[5438.88 --> 5440.04]  May we be united
[5440.04 --> 5441.00]  to You
[5441.00 --> 5442.54]  in our mission
[5442.54 --> 5443.00]  together.
[5443.46 --> 5444.90]  May we also
[5444.90 --> 5446.02]  be united
[5446.02 --> 5447.62]  to each other.
[5448.92 --> 5449.44]  Lord our God,
[5449.48 --> 5450.88]  we come to this table
[5450.88 --> 5452.00]  as a testimony
[5452.00 --> 5453.12]  that we
[5453.12 --> 5455.20]  are Your family,
[5455.36 --> 5455.96]  that these
[5455.96 --> 5457.26]  are our brothers
[5457.26 --> 5458.28]  brothers and sisters,
[5458.28 --> 5459.08]  that we
[5459.08 --> 5460.26]  are not
[5460.26 --> 5461.06]  alone.
[5463.28 --> 5464.36]  And as we eat
[5464.36 --> 5464.86]  together,
[5465.50 --> 5466.40]  may we also
[5466.40 --> 5467.18]  live
[5467.18 --> 5468.30]  together.
[5469.62 --> 5470.60]  Meet us now
[5470.60 --> 5471.38]  at this table,
[5471.50 --> 5471.86]  we pray,
[5471.98 --> 5472.46]  Lord Jesus,
[5472.72 --> 5473.56]  in Your name.
[5474.28 --> 5474.66]  Amen.
[5474.66 --> 5474.80]  Amen.
[5474.80 --> 5483.76]  As we come
[5483.76 --> 5484.74]  to the table
[5484.74 --> 5485.20]  together,
[5485.38 --> 5486.78]  there's a bit
[5486.78 --> 5489.16]  of a liturgy
[5489.16 --> 5489.96]  for us,
[5490.90 --> 5491.74]  a bit of
[5491.74 --> 5493.26]  some movement
[5493.26 --> 5494.36]  that we will
[5494.36 --> 5495.20]  gather around,
[5495.36 --> 5496.08]  and so there will be
[5496.08 --> 5496.92]  words on the screen
[5496.92 --> 5497.44]  behind me
[5497.44 --> 5498.04]  that you are
[5498.04 --> 5499.00]  invited to speak
[5499.00 --> 5500.54]  as we come
[5500.54 --> 5501.84]  to the table.
[5501.84 --> 5503.74]  Church of Jesus
[5503.74 --> 5504.18]  Christ,
[5504.40 --> 5505.16]  lift up
[5505.16 --> 5506.00]  your hearts.
[5508.74 --> 5509.40]  Let us
[5509.40 --> 5510.00]  give thanks
[5510.00 --> 5510.62]  to the Lord
[5510.62 --> 5511.34]  our God.
[5514.62 --> 5515.30]  Let's pray
[5515.30 --> 5515.64]  together.
[5517.00 --> 5517.98]  With joy,
[5518.18 --> 5518.90]  we praise
[5518.90 --> 5519.28]  You,
[5519.52 --> 5520.44]  gracious God,
[5520.96 --> 5521.60]  for You
[5521.60 --> 5522.44]  have created
[5522.44 --> 5523.36]  heaven and earth.
[5523.46 --> 5524.16]  You have made us
[5524.16 --> 5524.74]  in Your image
[5524.74 --> 5525.92]  and kept covenant
[5525.92 --> 5526.42]  with us
[5526.42 --> 5527.46]  even when we
[5527.46 --> 5528.94]  fell into sin.
[5529.60 --> 5530.50]  We give You
[5530.50 --> 5531.26]  thanks for
[5531.26 --> 5532.32]  Jesus Christ,
[5532.48 --> 5533.16]  who by His
[5533.16 --> 5533.54]  life,
[5533.94 --> 5534.16]  death,
[5534.28 --> 5534.96]  and resurrection
[5534.96 --> 5536.06]  opened to us
[5536.06 --> 5537.30]  the way of life
[5537.30 --> 5538.26]  everlasting.
[5539.18 --> 5539.54]  Amen.
[5541.48 --> 5542.58]  Our Lord Jesus,
[5542.92 --> 5544.08]  before He suffered,
[5544.28 --> 5545.02]  gave us
[5545.02 --> 5546.04]  this memorial
[5546.04 --> 5547.92]  of His sacrifice
[5547.92 --> 5549.16]  until He comes
[5549.16 --> 5549.52]  again.
[5550.86 --> 5551.76]  The Lord Jesus,
[5552.04 --> 5552.52]  on the night
[5552.52 --> 5553.12]  that He was
[5553.12 --> 5553.60]  betrayed,
[5554.32 --> 5554.98]  took bread.
[5556.22 --> 5556.62]  And when He
[5556.62 --> 5557.48]  had given thanks,
[5557.58 --> 5558.22]  He broke it
[5558.22 --> 5558.66]  and said,
[5558.66 --> 5560.16]  this is My
[5560.16 --> 5560.62]  body,
[5561.10 --> 5561.98]  which is for You.
[5562.64 --> 5563.26]  Do this
[5563.26 --> 5564.04]  in remembrance
[5564.04 --> 5565.28]  of Me.
[5567.16 --> 5568.20]  And in the same
[5568.20 --> 5568.66]  way,
[5568.78 --> 5569.78]  He took the cup
[5569.78 --> 5570.80]  after supper,
[5571.32 --> 5571.64]  saying,
[5572.24 --> 5572.94]  this cup
[5572.94 --> 5573.76]  is the new
[5573.76 --> 5574.14]  covenant
[5574.14 --> 5575.36]  in My blood.
[5576.84 --> 5577.72]  Whenever You
[5577.72 --> 5579.20]  drink it
[5579.20 --> 5580.12]  in remembrance
[5580.12 --> 5580.96]  of Me,
[5581.58 --> 5582.78]  we proclaim
[5582.78 --> 5584.10]  the Lord's death
[5584.10 --> 5585.18]  until He
[5585.18 --> 5586.68]  comes again.
[5590.32 --> 5591.88]  This is
[5591.88 --> 5592.84]  the mystery
[5592.84 --> 5594.62]  of our faith.
[5596.20 --> 5597.02]  Through the death,
[5597.16 --> 5597.74]  O Christ,
[5597.84 --> 5598.44]  we await.
[5599.04 --> 5600.28]  Through the resurrection,
[5600.52 --> 5601.72]  we await with hope.
[5602.18 --> 5603.14]  Your coming,
[5603.30 --> 5604.46]  we await with hope.
[5605.16 --> 5606.46]  Glory be to You,
[5606.60 --> 5607.20]  Lord Jesus.
[5608.74 --> 5609.72]  Church family,
[5609.84 --> 5610.66]  the Lord has
[5610.66 --> 5612.20]  prepared His table
[5612.20 --> 5614.04]  for all who love
[5614.04 --> 5615.66]  Him and who trust
[5615.66 --> 5617.26]  in Him alone
[5617.26 --> 5619.18]  for their salvation.
[5620.18 --> 5620.58]  And so,
[5620.78 --> 5621.88]  come to this table,
[5622.04 --> 5623.42]  you who have much faith,
[5623.74 --> 5624.28]  and come,
[5624.44 --> 5625.36]  you who would like
[5625.36 --> 5626.08]  to have more.
[5626.84 --> 5627.92]  Come to this table,
[5628.06 --> 5628.82]  you who have been
[5628.82 --> 5630.10]  to this sacrament often
[5630.10 --> 5631.44]  and you who have not
[5631.44 --> 5632.68]  been in a long time.
[5632.90 --> 5633.88]  You who have tried
[5633.88 --> 5634.72]  to follow Jesus
[5634.72 --> 5636.20]  and you who have failed.
[5636.60 --> 5637.90]  Come to this table
[5637.90 --> 5639.66]  because Jesus Christ
[5639.66 --> 5641.36]  is raised.
[5642.10 --> 5642.62]  Come.
[5642.62 --> 5643.74]  If you are here
[5643.74 --> 5645.12]  with us this morning
[5645.12 --> 5646.70]  or if you are at home
[5646.70 --> 5647.74]  and online,
[5647.96 --> 5649.44]  come because it is Christ
[5649.44 --> 5651.98]  who invites us here.
[5652.92 --> 5653.90]  The gifts of God
[5653.90 --> 5655.12]  for the people
[5655.12 --> 5656.12]  of God.
[5657.40 --> 5659.00]  As we come to this table
[5659.00 --> 5660.26]  here in our church,
[5660.88 --> 5661.88]  we will be ushered
[5661.88 --> 5662.40]  to the front
[5662.40 --> 5663.16]  and we will gather
[5663.16 --> 5664.14]  in a circle.
[5664.66 --> 5666.06]  We will pass the elements.
[5666.18 --> 5667.18]  When you pass the bread,
[5667.34 --> 5668.52]  we encourage you to say,
[5668.94 --> 5669.82]  body of Christ
[5669.82 --> 5670.64]  given for you.
[5670.84 --> 5671.98]  When you pass the juice,
[5671.98 --> 5673.16]  we encourage you to say,
[5673.28 --> 5674.20]  the blood of Christ
[5674.20 --> 5675.62]  shed for you.
[5676.34 --> 5677.34]  And then you will return
[5677.34 --> 5677.94]  to your seats
[5677.94 --> 5678.80]  and then the ushers
[5678.80 --> 5679.80]  will indicate
[5679.80 --> 5680.78]  for the next row
[5680.78 --> 5682.06]  to come up to the front.
[5682.88 --> 5683.96]  As you make your way
[5683.96 --> 5684.64]  up to the front,
[5684.78 --> 5685.44]  we encourage you
[5685.44 --> 5687.28]  to gather closely in
[5687.28 --> 5688.84]  and spread out wide
[5688.84 --> 5689.44]  to make sure
[5689.44 --> 5690.52]  there is enough room
[5690.52 --> 5692.22]  for everyone who comes.
[5692.90 --> 5693.96]  We're going to begin
[5693.96 --> 5695.36]  the first table
[5695.36 --> 5697.02]  with our worship volunteers
[5697.02 --> 5697.76]  and the elders
[5697.76 --> 5698.48]  who are helping
[5698.48 --> 5699.66]  facilitate this meal
[5699.66 --> 5701.24]  so that they can lead us
[5701.24 --> 5702.04]  in song
[5702.04 --> 5703.12]  as we go through
[5703.12 --> 5704.08]  the rest.
[5704.50 --> 5705.28]  And then also,
[5705.90 --> 5708.54]  we have prayer partners
[5708.54 --> 5709.66]  available during
[5709.66 --> 5710.30]  the celebration
[5710.30 --> 5711.00]  of the Lord's Supper.
[5711.28 --> 5712.14]  And so there are people
[5712.14 --> 5713.26]  who will be in the foyer
[5713.26 --> 5714.98]  with yellow name tags.
[5715.46 --> 5716.16]  If you would like
[5716.16 --> 5717.10]  to receive prayer
[5717.10 --> 5718.52]  before coming to the table
[5718.52 --> 5719.58]  or in place of coming
[5719.58 --> 5720.20]  to the table,
[5720.56 --> 5721.40]  they will meet you
[5721.40 --> 5722.34]  at the back
[5722.34 --> 5724.30]  and pray with you there.
[5725.18 --> 5726.04]  Can I invite up
[5726.04 --> 5726.72]  those who are
[5726.72 --> 5727.90]  helping us serve
[5727.90 --> 5728.62]  to the front?
[5754.18 --> 5755.14]  Body of Christ
[5755.14 --> 5755.86]  given for you.
[5755.86 --> 5755.90]  Amen.
[5757.90 --> 5760.30]  Body of Christ
[5760.30 --> 5760.98]  given for you.
[5760.98 --> 5761.48]  Amen.
[5787.90 --> 5803.52]  Eat and remember.
[5803.52 --> 5820.08]  the blood of Christ shed for you
[5824.08 --> 5825.52]  the blood of Christ shed for you
[5825.52 --> 5855.50]  the blood of Christ shed for you
[5855.52 --> 5874.86]  drink and believe
[5874.86 --> 5889.16]  as this first group is making their way to their positions
[5889.16 --> 5894.80]  I just remind you that if you are unable to come up to the front for whatever reason
[5894.80 --> 5899.46]  please indicate that to the ushering elder and they will serve you in your seat
[5899.46 --> 5911.62]  I just remind you of the blood of Christ shed for you in your seat
[5911.62 --> 5913.26]  wine
[5917.26 --> 5918.98]  recently
[5918.98 --> 5919.10]  it was heart of this
[5919.10 --> 5922.08]  while the blood of Christ shed for you in your seat
[5922.08 --> 5932.44]  and it was heart of God
[5932.44 --> 5951.58]  Just as I act without one plea,
[5951.58 --> 5958.30]  but that thy blood was shed for me,
[5958.30 --> 5968.30]  and that thou bidst me come to thee, O Lamb of God,
[5968.90 --> 5974.30]  I come, I come.
[5978.24 --> 5988.28]  Just as I am, though tossed about with many a convent,
[5988.30 --> 5992.28]  afflict men yet doubt,
[5992.72 --> 5997.44]  fightings and fears within,
[5997.88 --> 6002.30]  without, O Lamb of God,
[6003.16 --> 6008.30]  I come, I come.
