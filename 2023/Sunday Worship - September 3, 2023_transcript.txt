[3269.42 --> 3299.40]  And we're here.
[3299.40 --> 3329.40]  Thank you.
[3329.40 --> 3359.40]  So,
[3359.40 --> 3389.40]  hope.
[3389.40 --> 3419.38]  hope in the truth.
[3419.40 --> 3449.40]  And we're here.
[3449.40 --> 3479.40]  And we're here.
[3479.40 --> 3509.38]  And we're here.
[3509.38 --> 3539.38]  And we're here.
[3539.38 --> 3569.36]  And we're here.
[3569.36 --> 3599.36]  And we're here.
[3599.36 --> 3629.36]  And we're here.
[3629.36 --> 3659.36]  And we're here.
[3659.36 --> 3689.36]  And we're here.
[3689.36 --> 3719.36]  And we're here.
[3719.36 --> 3721.36]  And we're here.
[3721.36 --> 3751.36]  And we're here.
[3751.36 --> 3781.36]  And we're here.
[3781.36 --> 3782.36]  And we're here.
[3782.36 --> 3783.36]  And we're here.
[3783.36 --> 3811.34]  And we're here.
[3811.36 --> 3841.36]  And we're here.
[3841.36 --> 3842.36]  And we're here.
[3842.36 --> 3843.36]  And we're here.
[3843.36 --> 3845.36]  And we're here.
[3845.36 --> 3846.36]  And we're here.
[3846.36 --> 3847.36]  And we're here.
[3847.36 --> 3849.46]  And we're here.
[3849.46 --> 3854.36]  And we're here.
[3854.36 --> 3858.36]  And we're here.
[3858.36 --> 3870.34]  and that we could have none again so think about that for your own lives right if everything you
[3870.34 --> 3879.86]  have is by grace right if everything you have is a gift from God if you lose it or if God takes it
[3879.86 --> 3894.68]  away you can't be mad you can be humble right and you can and you can endure with God because God only
[3894.68 --> 3904.46]  does good things but if you get mad when you lose all those things what is that saying about your
[3904.46 --> 3912.84]  understanding of power or privilege or place let's take this another step further this is a good
[3912.84 --> 3921.38]  reminder for Christians right in the world today because sometimes our complaining about justice
[3921.38 --> 3931.56]  issues or our complaining about injustice is actually a veiled lament or a veiled not so veiled whining
[3931.56 --> 3934.12]  for a loss of privilege
[3934.12 --> 3942.02]  for those of you who will get this reference it's really easy for Christians to sound like a bunch
[3942.02 --> 3952.38]  of Karens in the world today and pretend that they don't remember your origins remember where you've
[3952.38 --> 3960.74]  come from remember that that it is God who gives and God who takes away blessed be the name
[3960.74 --> 3971.88]  of the Lord again back in Genesis 48 let's keep going think of the people who in humility are waiting to enter
[3971.88 --> 3980.92]  into the land of promise and Moses is telling them this story from their history right to a people waiting
[3980.92 --> 3985.06]  who are waiting to enter into the land this is the people who are waiting to enter into the land this is a
[3985.06 --> 3993.86]  lesson regarding the reward to protect Joseph not instigate selling him off into slavery so many years before
[3993.86 --> 4001.98]  are punished right in the covenant language of the Old Testament this is about blessings and curses for
[4001.98 --> 4010.86]  faithfulness and as a people who are then about to campaign into the land who are about to make war in Canaan this is a
[4010.86 --> 4021.20]  really important reminder against the consequences of senseless selfish violence and pride if they are to remain
[4021.20 --> 4034.78]  faithful to God the faith of Jacob in Joseph in the blessing of Ephraim and Manasseh serves as what we'll call a watch
[4034.78 --> 4045.82]  point a calling out for Israel to be faithful in what comes before them and then for us to be faithful in what comes before us for us to be
[4045.82 --> 4062.78]  faithful to God's will in the world this story is told to focus obedience the story is told to focus our faithfulness and really the same is true for all of Hebrews 11
[4062.78 --> 4080.78]  Hebrews 11 right we can read in the very beginning now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see and then note this line from Hebrews 11 this is what the ancients were commended for
[4080.78 --> 4109.78]  commended for now that's an important word in this chapter actually it shows up three more times if you were to read the whole thing in verse 4 we read by faith Abel was commended as righteousness in verse 5 Enoch is commended as one who pleases God and then in verse 39 which all of this has been building to these were all that is the people in this list and the ones who didn't make this list
[4109.78 --> 4115.40]  these were all that is the most accurate and all different and evidence for that is evident everyone in history
[4115.40 --> 4127.52]  and capitons they're sent to this telling us to see andção to these women thathoda in the world of faith and Christian helen m przyron
[4127.54 --> 4134.14]  the root of faith archaeth� do you know that the root Greek word so we looked at a Hebrew word and now we're in the new
[4134.14 --> 4142.54]  These people are a witness of faith because in their lives they've witnessed the faithfulness of God.
[4143.92 --> 4149.34]  And as a witness, their faith is a testimony for you and for me.
[4151.02 --> 4154.54]  Now, interestingly, for those of you who are into this sort of thing,
[4154.74 --> 4159.42]  marturio is also the word from which we get the English word martyr.
[4159.42 --> 4164.22]  A martyr is someone who dies for what they believe.
[4165.38 --> 4169.40]  Perhaps the ultimate witness of faith and faithfulness.
[4170.92 --> 4176.02]  And so we tell these stories and you tell your stories of faith and faithfulness,
[4176.04 --> 4180.42]  even as you fumble forward, in order to focus your faithfulness,
[4181.32 --> 4184.54]  in order to make us a better witness to Christ.
[4184.54 --> 4192.02]  And so then, how you tell your story matters.
[4194.00 --> 4199.44]  Again, let's jump back to Genesis 48 and how this story is told.
[4199.56 --> 4204.32]  Remember, you've got a bunch of people standing on the precipice of entering the promised land,
[4204.56 --> 4205.70]  war in front of them.
[4206.64 --> 4210.82]  And here's how this story is told, because it courses with hope.
[4210.82 --> 4216.98]  Jacob begins by remembering God's promise in verse 3 and 4.
[4217.16 --> 4220.66]  God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan,
[4220.76 --> 4222.68]  and there he blessed me and said to me,
[4223.14 --> 4226.64]  I am going to make you fruitful and increase your numbers.
[4227.02 --> 4228.98]  I will make you a community of peoples,
[4229.22 --> 4235.00]  and I will give this land as an everlasting possession to your descendants after you.
[4235.00 --> 4241.86]  And I imagine that it was hard for Jacob to trust in the promise of God
[4241.86 --> 4244.28]  when he heard that Joseph was killed.
[4246.40 --> 4252.00]  And yet, fast forward now to Joseph's sons, and he speaks in hope.
[4252.88 --> 4255.44]  And then there's more hope in verse 11.
[4255.44 --> 4268.94]  That's hope.
[4270.40 --> 4273.46]  And then thirdly, we keep going, verse 21, right?
[4273.58 --> 4276.36]  On the promises of God, even in the face of death,
[4276.36 --> 4279.66]  Israel, Jacob says to Joseph,
[4280.12 --> 4281.48]  I am about to die,
[4282.10 --> 4287.04]  but God will be with you and take you back to the land of your fathers.
[4288.26 --> 4291.12]  God has a plan in the midst of all of this.
[4291.26 --> 4294.38]  God has given a promise in the midst of all of this.
[4294.54 --> 4296.26]  And so, hope.
[4297.60 --> 4302.16]  And for Jacob, what he has begun to learn over the course of his life
[4302.16 --> 4306.66]  is that the promises of God are fixed and sure.
[4308.04 --> 4311.18]  That's where his hope comes from.
[4312.44 --> 4316.50]  He believes that because God said it, it's as good as done.
[4317.42 --> 4322.30]  That because God said it, it is accomplished, it is fixed, and it is sure.
[4322.50 --> 4325.54]  He said this before, that God cannot lie.
[4326.08 --> 4329.16]  It is an ontological, universal impossibility.
[4329.16 --> 4333.00]  It would be for God to deny his very nature.
[4333.52 --> 4337.28]  For God to lie would be like seeing a pig fly, right?
[4337.30 --> 4337.88]  It's impossible.
[4338.92 --> 4343.58]  And so, when he says something, when he promises something,
[4343.80 --> 4345.92]  it is fixed and sure.
[4346.64 --> 4348.38]  You could take that to the bank.
[4349.82 --> 4354.52]  Now again, think about this people who are standing on the precipice of this new land,
[4354.52 --> 4359.04]  who are standing ready to enter into this promise,
[4359.16 --> 4361.70]  who are about to war over what God has said.
[4362.06 --> 4363.12]  And think about that.
[4363.24 --> 4367.28]  The next time you are facing something that you are unsure of,
[4367.44 --> 4369.34]  the next time that you are afraid,
[4370.16 --> 4372.22]  the next time that you have to go to the hospital,
[4372.66 --> 4374.64]  or on Tuesday when you start school.
[4374.64 --> 4380.88]  Sometimes, sometimes when I do counseling,
[4381.62 --> 4384.86]  I get people to remember,
[4385.52 --> 4387.34]  and then even to memorize,
[4387.86 --> 4391.36]  what God says to you about you.
[4392.08 --> 4392.52]  Right?
[4392.56 --> 4393.64]  About who he is,
[4393.76 --> 4397.16]  and about what that means for who you are.
[4398.10 --> 4398.30]  Right?
[4398.30 --> 4400.88]  And sometimes we need to memorize these truths,
[4400.88 --> 4403.54]  so that we can preach it to ourselves,
[4403.54 --> 4404.90]  when that shame voice,
[4405.04 --> 4406.04]  or that guilt voice,
[4406.12 --> 4407.10]  or that fear voice,
[4407.18 --> 4409.74]  or that voice that says that you are worthless.
[4410.24 --> 4410.38]  Right?
[4410.42 --> 4411.90]  When that gets so loud,
[4412.20 --> 4414.78]  sometimes we need the voice of God to break through.
[4415.34 --> 4416.60]  And the only way we can do that,
[4416.66 --> 4417.78]  is if we have it in our heads,
[4417.96 --> 4418.84]  and in our hearts.
[4420.22 --> 4422.10]  And so we share texts like this.
[4423.24 --> 4425.52]  My God will meet all your needs,
[4425.52 --> 4429.64]  according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus.
[4429.64 --> 4431.64]  Remember, God said it.
[4432.52 --> 4433.22]  It's done.
[4434.30 --> 4435.98]  It's fixed and sure.
[4437.18 --> 4439.00]  Never will I leave you.
[4439.66 --> 4441.40]  Never will I forsake you.
[4442.48 --> 4443.18]  God said it.
[4443.68 --> 4444.36]  It's done.
[4445.16 --> 4445.94]  It's fixed.
[4446.56 --> 4447.22]  It's sure.
[4448.38 --> 4448.54]  Right?
[4448.58 --> 4451.90]  I can do all things through him who gives me strength.
[4452.04 --> 4452.86]  God said it.
[4453.56 --> 4454.34]  It's done.
[4454.34 --> 4457.46]  And we know that in all things,
[4457.56 --> 4459.88]  God works for the good of those who love him,
[4459.94 --> 4462.42]  who have been called according to his purpose.
[4462.60 --> 4463.34]  God said it.
[4463.98 --> 4464.74]  It's done.
[4465.96 --> 4467.52]  And this one, Isaiah 46,
[4467.74 --> 4470.42]  which we heard from John a couple weeks ago.
[4470.42 --> 4473.80]  Even to your old age and gray hairs,
[4473.98 --> 4475.28]  I am he.
[4475.78 --> 4477.74]  I am he who will sustain you.
[4477.82 --> 4478.64]  I have made you.
[4478.72 --> 4479.60]  I will carry you.
[4479.80 --> 4480.96]  I will sustain you.
[4481.02 --> 4483.06]  And I will rescue you.
[4483.14 --> 4483.92]  God said it.
[4484.58 --> 4485.40]  It's done.
[4487.36 --> 4487.48]  Right?
[4487.70 --> 4489.66]  Faith means hope,
[4490.08 --> 4494.98]  because God's promises are firm and fixed and sure.
[4494.98 --> 4499.36]  And in the midst of life's chaos or turmoil,
[4500.14 --> 4501.98]  no matter how bad things get,
[4502.14 --> 4504.42]  God's promises are fixed and firm.
[4504.56 --> 4506.60]  They are as good as done.
[4506.72 --> 4509.76]  And so maybe as you sit here listening to this,
[4509.80 --> 4511.82]  or as you sit at home listening to this,
[4511.92 --> 4514.32]  maybe you've been fighting off death
[4514.32 --> 4516.48]  for what seems like years,
[4517.20 --> 4519.48]  but now the end seems near.
[4519.48 --> 4525.34]  Maybe you've been lost in the valley of mourning,
[4525.54 --> 4528.18]  or it's been not just a dark night of the soul,
[4528.26 --> 4531.06]  but a dark month or a dark year of the soul.
[4531.34 --> 4534.36]  Maybe you've been crying yourself to sleep for weeks
[4534.36 --> 4535.94]  because of something that hasn't happened.
[4536.30 --> 4537.58]  Maybe you've lived in pain
[4537.58 --> 4539.42]  because of an injury or an infection,
[4539.42 --> 4542.10]  and now all you can think and experience
[4542.10 --> 4545.06]  in your ordinary life is that life is pain.
[4547.38 --> 4548.88]  If any of those are you,
[4549.48 --> 4553.12]  God's promise is true.
[4555.34 --> 4558.22]  God is who God is,
[4558.52 --> 4559.94]  and so there is hope.
[4561.08 --> 4564.08]  He will wipe away every tear from our eyes
[4564.08 --> 4566.10]  and there will be no mourning or death
[4566.10 --> 4567.38]  or crying or pain
[4567.38 --> 4569.86]  for the old order of things has passed away.
[4570.12 --> 4571.92]  He who was seated on the throne said,
[4572.06 --> 4574.14]  I am making everything new.
[4574.36 --> 4575.62]  That's a promise,
[4575.90 --> 4576.82]  and that's firm,
[4576.94 --> 4577.96]  and that's fixed
[4577.96 --> 4580.18]  because God said it.
[4580.48 --> 4581.82]  It's done.
[4584.82 --> 4586.12]  And now I get it
[4586.12 --> 4587.98]  because maybe
[4587.98 --> 4590.54]  in the midst of all that,
[4590.92 --> 4592.46]  you can't believe it.
[4593.90 --> 4595.56]  Maybe whatever you are facing
[4595.56 --> 4597.46]  seems so big or so far gone
[4597.46 --> 4598.38]  or so impossible
[4598.38 --> 4599.48]  or so broken
[4599.48 --> 4601.18]  that it just can't be fixed.
[4601.18 --> 4602.90]  But again,
[4603.40 --> 4605.70]  look at the story of Jacob
[4605.70 --> 4608.14]  blessing Ephraim and Manasseh
[4608.14 --> 4610.66]  because there's something there for us too.
[4611.10 --> 4611.88]  Because you see,
[4612.20 --> 4614.98]  God is a God of the unexpected.
[4615.82 --> 4617.82]  He's a God of the impossible.
[4617.82 --> 4621.80]  And so in spite of society's expectations,
[4622.14 --> 4625.06]  in spite of Joseph's own protests,
[4625.58 --> 4626.78]  Israel, Jacob,
[4627.18 --> 4628.86]  blesses the younger son
[4628.86 --> 4630.02]  over the older.
[4630.16 --> 4632.18]  He gives the younger boy prominence
[4632.18 --> 4633.72]  and he puts Ephraim
[4633.72 --> 4635.24]  before Manasseh.
[4636.02 --> 4636.92]  Now we've seen this
[4636.92 --> 4637.74]  in this series,
[4637.84 --> 4638.22]  have we not?
[4638.56 --> 4638.76]  Right?
[4638.80 --> 4639.86]  This has been God's pattern
[4639.86 --> 4640.98]  for four generations
[4640.98 --> 4641.62]  in Genesis.
[4641.90 --> 4644.04]  God put Isaac over Ishmael,
[4644.14 --> 4645.82]  he put Jacob over Esau,
[4645.82 --> 4647.00]  Joseph over Reuben,
[4647.26 --> 4649.88]  and now Ephraim over Manasseh.
[4650.00 --> 4651.92]  All of them younger sons
[4651.92 --> 4653.32]  over the oldest.
[4654.78 --> 4655.16]  Right?
[4655.22 --> 4656.06]  This is the inversion
[4656.06 --> 4657.40]  of primogeniture.
[4657.52 --> 4658.26]  We've talked about it before.
[4658.40 --> 4660.44]  God does the unexpected.
[4662.26 --> 4663.22]  Or to put it
[4663.22 --> 4664.66]  in the language
[4664.66 --> 4665.42]  of the New Testament,
[4666.78 --> 4668.42]  God chose the foolish things
[4668.42 --> 4669.04]  of the world
[4669.04 --> 4670.10]  to shame the wise.
[4670.58 --> 4672.26]  The weak things of the world
[4672.26 --> 4673.70]  to shame the strong.
[4673.70 --> 4675.88]  And that is why,
[4676.06 --> 4676.82]  for Christ's sake,
[4676.92 --> 4678.06]  I delight in weaknesses,
[4678.38 --> 4679.12]  in insults,
[4679.16 --> 4679.60]  in hardships,
[4679.76 --> 4680.48]  in persecutions,
[4680.60 --> 4681.24]  in difficulties.
[4681.50 --> 4683.02]  For when I am weak,
[4683.36 --> 4685.56]  then I am strong.
[4686.92 --> 4688.74]  For no word of God
[4688.74 --> 4690.44]  will ever fail.
[4691.94 --> 4693.10]  With man,
[4693.26 --> 4694.22]  this is impossible,
[4694.84 --> 4696.96]  but not with God.
[4697.42 --> 4699.08]  All things are possible
[4699.08 --> 4700.26]  with God.
[4700.26 --> 4702.40]  As with Ephraim
[4702.40 --> 4703.20]  over Manasseh,
[4703.50 --> 4705.20]  God does the unexpected.
[4706.04 --> 4706.42]  And so,
[4706.62 --> 4707.26]  with God,
[4707.34 --> 4708.30]  in whatever your life
[4708.30 --> 4710.04]  is in the middle of,
[4710.34 --> 4711.72]  expect the unexpected.
[4715.62 --> 4717.08]  Because that's who God is.
[4718.06 --> 4719.24]  And He can't deny Himself.
[4719.90 --> 4721.78]  He can't deny His nature.
[4722.36 --> 4723.26]  And that's what He does.
[4723.26 --> 4727.84]  And I want to conclude this morning
[4727.84 --> 4729.82]  with one last lesson
[4729.82 --> 4731.06]  about faith and hope
[4731.06 --> 4732.84]  and God
[4732.84 --> 4734.04]  from the life of Jacob.
[4735.42 --> 4736.28]  Because you see,
[4737.24 --> 4739.00]  what can so easily happen,
[4739.08 --> 4740.60]  and what I'm afraid happens
[4740.60 --> 4742.72]  after a series like this,
[4743.12 --> 4744.38]  after we hear stories
[4744.38 --> 4745.40]  of great faith,
[4745.74 --> 4747.14]  and as we lift up people
[4747.14 --> 4748.68]  who have been great examples
[4748.68 --> 4749.92]  to us,
[4749.92 --> 4750.88]  I'm afraid
[4750.88 --> 4752.80]  that some of us
[4752.80 --> 4753.88]  might have the opposite
[4753.88 --> 4755.72]  of the intended impact.
[4756.94 --> 4758.36]  And we might hear stories
[4758.36 --> 4759.18]  like that and go,
[4759.60 --> 4760.78]  I could never be like that.
[4761.58 --> 4762.90]  I could never do that.
[4763.56 --> 4764.42]  I would never be
[4764.42 --> 4765.26]  that kind of person
[4765.26 --> 4765.80]  to someone.
[4766.72 --> 4767.88]  And so we give up.
[4768.56 --> 4769.40]  We stop trying.
[4770.14 --> 4771.30]  But here's what we need to see.
[4771.68 --> 4771.78]  Okay?
[4772.68 --> 4774.50]  All of these faith heroes
[4774.50 --> 4775.22]  that we've looked at
[4775.22 --> 4775.62]  this summer,
[4775.92 --> 4777.40]  even the amazing people
[4777.40 --> 4778.88]  that we have talked about
[4778.88 --> 4780.32]  from our own lives.
[4780.44 --> 4781.46]  All of them
[4781.46 --> 4782.92]  are at one point or another
[4782.92 --> 4784.82]  dubious characters.
[4786.98 --> 4787.42]  Right?
[4787.48 --> 4788.90]  With the exception of Enoch,
[4789.14 --> 4791.62]  we know that everyone
[4791.62 --> 4792.96]  on this list
[4792.96 --> 4795.50]  just aren't good people
[4795.50 --> 4796.34]  all the time.
[4797.62 --> 4798.78]  Now, we can guarantee
[4798.78 --> 4799.96]  that Enoch wasn't
[4799.96 --> 4800.76]  because he was also
[4800.76 --> 4801.50]  impacted by the fall.
[4801.56 --> 4802.04]  We just don't know
[4802.04 --> 4803.46]  the details of his story.
[4804.28 --> 4804.98]  But for instance,
[4805.16 --> 4806.38]  Noah, he grumbled.
[4806.38 --> 4808.64]  He got drunk.
[4809.14 --> 4810.18]  And he passed out.
[4811.34 --> 4812.56]  Abraham lied
[4812.56 --> 4814.14]  multiple times.
[4814.80 --> 4815.68]  Sarah laughed
[4815.68 --> 4816.78]  at God's ability
[4816.78 --> 4817.58]  and his power.
[4817.96 --> 4818.76]  Isaac lied
[4818.76 --> 4819.80]  just like his dad.
[4820.58 --> 4821.36]  Jacob cheated
[4821.36 --> 4822.56]  and he ankle-grabbed
[4822.56 --> 4823.90]  his way through life
[4823.90 --> 4825.08]  over and over again.
[4825.40 --> 4827.12]  Moses had anger problems.
[4827.24 --> 4827.84]  He killed a man.
[4828.96 --> 4829.80]  Rahab, too,
[4829.88 --> 4830.70]  was a sex worker
[4830.70 --> 4831.80]  and a liar.
[4832.16 --> 4832.26]  Right?
[4832.32 --> 4833.60]  Every one of these people
[4833.60 --> 4834.50]  that we've looked at
[4834.50 --> 4835.84]  fall short.
[4838.88 --> 4840.30]  But it's not about them.
[4842.16 --> 4842.36]  Right?
[4842.42 --> 4843.08]  Their faith
[4843.08 --> 4844.58]  is first and foremost
[4844.58 --> 4846.50]  about God's faithfulness.
[4847.64 --> 4847.78]  Right?
[4847.84 --> 4849.34]  Their stories of faith
[4849.34 --> 4850.82]  fuel our faith
[4850.82 --> 4851.50]  and then now
[4851.50 --> 4853.20]  your stories of faith
[4853.20 --> 4854.68]  fuel my faith
[4854.68 --> 4856.54]  because they all
[4856.54 --> 4858.08]  reveal a God
[4858.08 --> 4860.08]  who is faithful.
[4860.08 --> 4864.36]  And so each week
[4864.36 --> 4866.52]  as we look at a story
[4866.52 --> 4867.38]  of a faith hero
[4867.38 --> 4869.12]  we end by talking
[4869.12 --> 4870.02]  about a person
[4870.02 --> 4870.46]  who has been
[4870.46 --> 4871.36]  that kind of example
[4871.36 --> 4871.76]  to us
[4871.76 --> 4872.78]  who has shown
[4872.78 --> 4874.36]  us heroic faith
[4874.36 --> 4875.04]  in our lives.
[4875.14 --> 4876.02]  We've heard this sort
[4876.02 --> 4877.20]  of testimony
[4877.20 --> 4877.92]  right?
[4877.98 --> 4878.46]  Of a faith
[4878.46 --> 4879.34]  that is commended
[4879.34 --> 4880.46]  to us.
[4881.46 --> 4882.86]  And on this last Sunday
[4882.86 --> 4886.00]  you
[4886.00 --> 4888.70]  are that story.
[4888.70 --> 4891.06]  You
[4891.06 --> 4893.56]  are those people.
[4894.72 --> 4894.96]  You
[4894.96 --> 4896.26]  are the great
[4896.26 --> 4897.36]  cloud of witnesses
[4897.36 --> 4898.74]  that surround
[4898.74 --> 4899.46]  one another
[4899.46 --> 4900.84]  that champion
[4900.84 --> 4901.92]  each other
[4901.92 --> 4903.24]  to fix our eyes
[4903.24 --> 4903.88]  on Jesus.
[4904.16 --> 4904.40]  You
[4904.40 --> 4905.48]  are the great
[4905.48 --> 4906.24]  cloud of witnesses
[4906.24 --> 4907.20]  that commend
[4907.20 --> 4908.20]  each other
[4908.20 --> 4908.98]  to faith.
[4910.54 --> 4911.40]  As we run
[4911.40 --> 4912.10]  this race
[4912.10 --> 4913.06]  that was marked
[4913.06 --> 4913.78]  out for us
[4913.78 --> 4916.12]  your story
[4916.12 --> 4917.54]  is the one
[4917.54 --> 4918.22]  that matters.
[4918.70 --> 4919.86]  Your story
[4919.86 --> 4920.68]  is the one
[4920.68 --> 4921.60]  that God uses
[4921.60 --> 4922.96]  to draw out
[4922.96 --> 4923.68]  faith.
[4923.80 --> 4924.64]  Your story
[4924.64 --> 4926.22]  is your story
[4926.22 --> 4927.08]  and your story
[4927.08 --> 4927.88]  about God
[4927.88 --> 4928.54]  and faith
[4928.54 --> 4929.14]  and life
[4929.14 --> 4929.72]  and Jesus
[4929.72 --> 4930.70]  and church
[4930.70 --> 4931.54]  and community
[4931.54 --> 4932.72]  that's yours
[4932.72 --> 4933.60]  to declare
[4933.60 --> 4934.42]  because that's
[4934.42 --> 4935.26]  the story
[4935.26 --> 4937.00]  God uses.
[4938.10 --> 4938.92]  In all your
[4938.92 --> 4939.56]  weaknesses
[4939.56 --> 4940.88]  your story
[4940.88 --> 4941.44]  of faith
[4941.44 --> 4942.72]  is God's story
[4942.72 --> 4943.48]  of his strength
[4943.48 --> 4943.90]  in you.
[4944.74 --> 4945.60]  In all your
[4945.60 --> 4947.14]  wandering disobedience
[4947.14 --> 4947.80]  your story
[4947.80 --> 4948.30]  of faith
[4948.30 --> 4949.38]  is God's story
[4949.38 --> 4950.46]  of Christ's
[4950.46 --> 4951.54]  perfect obedience
[4951.54 --> 4952.76]  for you.
[4954.10 --> 4954.90]  And in your
[4954.90 --> 4955.44]  striving
[4955.44 --> 4956.08]  and your
[4956.08 --> 4956.80]  stumbling
[4956.80 --> 4957.94]  your story
[4957.94 --> 4958.42]  of faith
[4958.42 --> 4959.20]  is God's
[4959.20 --> 4959.84]  story
[4959.84 --> 4960.76]  of his plan
[4960.76 --> 4961.98]  and his purpose
[4961.98 --> 4963.52]  through you.
[4963.52 --> 4964.52]  faith
[4964.52 --> 4965.52]  is God's
[4965.52 --> 4966.18]  God's story
[4966.18 --> 4967.30]  Now you probably
[4967.30 --> 4967.72]  know
[4967.72 --> 4969.12]  many of you
[4969.12 --> 4970.60]  that Jacob's name
[4970.60 --> 4971.74]  was changed
[4971.74 --> 4972.46]  to Israel.
[4972.62 --> 4973.20]  We've seen that
[4973.20 --> 4973.94]  even as we looked
[4973.94 --> 4974.76]  at Genesis 48.
[4974.94 --> 4975.42]  That story
[4975.42 --> 4977.06]  is told in Genesis 32.
[4977.48 --> 4978.10]  You can read it.
[4978.42 --> 4978.90]  Israel
[4978.90 --> 4980.86]  means in Hebrew
[4980.86 --> 4981.64]  struggles
[4981.64 --> 4982.46]  with God.
[4983.26 --> 4983.88]  It comes from
[4983.88 --> 4984.42]  the story
[4984.42 --> 4985.30]  where Jacob
[4985.30 --> 4985.82]  wrestled
[4985.82 --> 4986.36]  with God.
[4987.46 --> 4988.14]  So here's
[4988.14 --> 4988.54]  what I want you
[4988.54 --> 4988.82]  to hear.
[4988.82 --> 4990.56]  faith
[4990.56 --> 4991.20]  that is
[4991.20 --> 4992.02]  commendable
[4992.02 --> 4993.52]  is not
[4993.52 --> 4994.42]  going to be
[4994.42 --> 4995.42]  without struggle.
[4996.20 --> 4996.70]  It's not
[4996.70 --> 4997.18]  going to be
[4997.18 --> 4997.86]  without doubt
[4997.86 --> 4998.74]  or questions
[4998.74 --> 4999.44]  or faltering.
[5000.20 --> 5000.50]  Faith
[5000.50 --> 5001.00]  that is
[5001.00 --> 5001.70]  commendable
[5001.70 --> 5002.46]  is a faith
[5002.46 --> 5003.70]  that pursues
[5003.70 --> 5004.34]  God
[5004.34 --> 5005.30]  that wrestles
[5005.30 --> 5005.90]  with him
[5005.90 --> 5007.00]  in the midst
[5007.00 --> 5007.60]  of those
[5007.60 --> 5008.34]  feelings.
[5011.56 --> 5012.88]  In 2 Timothy
[5012.88 --> 5014.22]  Paul gives
[5014.22 --> 5014.96]  these words
[5014.96 --> 5015.46]  to his
[5015.46 --> 5015.94]  young
[5015.94 --> 5016.64]  protege
[5016.64 --> 5017.14]  who had
[5017.14 --> 5017.62]  questions
[5017.62 --> 5018.14]  about what
[5018.14 --> 5018.46]  it means
[5018.46 --> 5018.96]  to lead
[5018.96 --> 5019.64]  and to live
[5019.64 --> 5020.44]  in faith
[5020.44 --> 5020.80]  about the
[5020.80 --> 5021.54]  promises of God.
[5021.64 --> 5022.06]  He says
[5022.06 --> 5023.38]  if we are
[5023.38 --> 5024.22]  faithless
[5024.22 --> 5025.48]  he will
[5025.48 --> 5026.48]  remain faithful
[5026.48 --> 5027.36]  for he
[5027.36 --> 5027.98]  cannot
[5027.98 --> 5028.70]  disown
[5028.70 --> 5029.60]  himself.
[5030.82 --> 5031.54]  God
[5031.54 --> 5032.08]  said it.
[5032.94 --> 5033.68]  It's
[5033.68 --> 5033.94]  done.
[5035.62 --> 5036.34]  That's
[5036.34 --> 5037.02]  a promise
[5037.02 --> 5037.94]  that we
[5037.94 --> 5038.48]  can hang
[5038.48 --> 5039.72]  our hearts
[5039.72 --> 5040.12]  on.
[5040.92 --> 5041.54]  That's
[5041.54 --> 5042.62]  a reality
[5042.62 --> 5043.50]  that
[5043.50 --> 5044.70]  changes
[5044.70 --> 5046.08]  things
[5046.08 --> 5046.62]  for us.
[5046.74 --> 5047.10]  That's
[5047.10 --> 5047.92]  why we
[5047.92 --> 5048.34]  can
[5048.34 --> 5048.94]  have
[5048.94 --> 5049.68]  hope.
[5050.82 --> 5051.12]  Faith
[5051.12 --> 5051.50]  is
[5051.50 --> 5052.36]  confidence
[5052.36 --> 5052.86]  in what
[5052.86 --> 5053.20]  we hope
[5053.20 --> 5053.48]  for
[5053.48 --> 5053.76]  and an
[5053.76 --> 5054.28]  assurance
[5054.28 --> 5055.00]  about what
[5055.00 --> 5055.26]  we do
[5055.26 --> 5055.66]  not see
[5055.66 --> 5056.32]  because
[5056.32 --> 5057.10]  God
[5057.10 --> 5057.84]  is
[5057.84 --> 5058.90]  faithful.
[5060.70 --> 5061.20]  And so
[5061.20 --> 5063.02]  step out
[5063.02 --> 5063.26]  of the
[5063.26 --> 5063.54]  boat.
[5066.04 --> 5066.96]  Step out
[5066.96 --> 5067.20]  of the
[5067.20 --> 5067.48]  boat
[5067.48 --> 5068.58]  and see
[5068.58 --> 5070.04]  God.
[5071.34 --> 5072.00]  Step out
[5072.00 --> 5072.42]  of the boat
[5072.42 --> 5073.12]  in faith
[5073.12 --> 5074.62]  and with hope
[5074.62 --> 5076.06]  and see
[5076.06 --> 5077.32]  what God
[5077.32 --> 5078.30]  will do.
[5079.08 --> 5079.84]  Because the
[5079.84 --> 5080.22]  end of the
[5080.22 --> 5080.62]  story
[5080.62 --> 5081.86]  is this.
[5082.54 --> 5083.04]  God
[5083.04 --> 5084.18]  is
[5084.18 --> 5085.48]  faithful.
[5086.54 --> 5086.80]  Amen.
[5087.34 --> 5088.12]  Let's pray
[5088.12 --> 5088.44]  together.
[5091.14 --> 5091.90]  Faithful,
[5092.56 --> 5092.98]  holy
[5092.98 --> 5093.76]  God,
[5094.96 --> 5095.46]  fuel
[5095.46 --> 5096.78]  our hope
[5096.78 --> 5097.66]  in the world
[5097.66 --> 5098.46]  as we share
[5098.46 --> 5099.66]  stories of life
[5099.66 --> 5100.34]  and faith
[5100.34 --> 5101.04]  together.
[5101.26 --> 5101.98]  Use us,
[5102.10 --> 5103.68]  even us,
[5104.16 --> 5105.26]  to declare
[5105.26 --> 5106.02]  your kingdom
[5106.02 --> 5106.88]  come and
[5106.88 --> 5107.52]  your kingdom
[5107.52 --> 5108.42]  coming.
[5109.94 --> 5111.40]  Use these
[5111.40 --> 5112.76]  faith stories
[5112.76 --> 5113.22]  here,
[5113.40 --> 5114.26]  cultivated in
[5114.26 --> 5114.94]  this room
[5114.94 --> 5115.50]  today,
[5116.00 --> 5117.32]  to stir
[5117.32 --> 5118.36]  up and
[5118.36 --> 5118.98]  spur
[5118.98 --> 5120.56]  on our
[5120.56 --> 5121.40]  lives of
[5121.40 --> 5122.28]  faith and
[5122.28 --> 5123.34]  faithful obedience
[5123.34 --> 5124.08]  together.
[5124.08 --> 5124.16]  Father,
[5124.88 --> 5127.50]  whether we
[5127.50 --> 5128.40]  are standing
[5128.40 --> 5128.84]  in the
[5128.84 --> 5129.34]  valley of
[5129.34 --> 5129.78]  the shadow
[5129.78 --> 5130.32]  or you
[5130.32 --> 5131.02]  are calling
[5131.02 --> 5131.88]  us to
[5131.88 --> 5132.84]  enter a
[5132.84 --> 5133.32]  land we
[5133.32 --> 5133.82]  know not
[5133.82 --> 5134.22]  of,
[5135.36 --> 5136.18]  may we
[5136.18 --> 5137.32]  go in
[5137.32 --> 5138.98]  hope and
[5138.98 --> 5139.70]  in confidence
[5139.70 --> 5140.68]  because of
[5140.68 --> 5141.60]  who you
[5141.60 --> 5144.08]  are and
[5144.08 --> 5144.94]  because of
[5144.94 --> 5145.92]  who you
[5145.92 --> 5147.02]  have declared
[5147.02 --> 5148.50]  us to
[5148.50 --> 5148.76]  be.
[5149.66 --> 5150.10]  In the
[5150.10 --> 5150.32]  name of
[5150.32 --> 5150.96]  Jesus Christ,
[5151.12 --> 5151.50]  we pray.
[5152.34 --> 5152.76]  Amen.
[5154.08 --> 5164.16]  Please stand
[5164.16 --> 5164.66]  with us.
[5178.34 --> 5180.06]  When I
[5180.06 --> 5181.04]  fear my
[5181.04 --> 5183.34]  faithful faith,
[5183.34 --> 5185.00]  Christ will
[5185.00 --> 5185.90]  hold me
[5185.90 --> 5187.18]  fast.
[5187.82 --> 5188.82]  When the
[5188.82 --> 5189.68]  tenter
[5189.68 --> 5190.34]  will
[5190.34 --> 5191.42]  prevail,
[5192.56 --> 5193.68]  he will
[5193.68 --> 5194.72]  hold me
[5194.72 --> 5195.98]  fast.
[5196.62 --> 5197.66]  I could
[5197.66 --> 5198.42]  never
[5198.42 --> 5199.30]  keep
[5199.30 --> 5199.64]  the
[5199.64 --> 5200.72]  Lord,
[5201.42 --> 5201.92]  through
[5201.92 --> 5202.42]  thy
[5202.42 --> 5203.22]  fearful
[5203.22 --> 5204.80]  path,
[5205.30 --> 5205.76]  for
[5205.76 --> 5206.22]  my
[5206.22 --> 5207.18]  love is
[5207.18 --> 5208.04]  after
[5208.04 --> 5209.10]  Lord,
[5210.00 --> 5210.96]  he will
[5210.96 --> 5211.96]  hold me
[5211.96 --> 5212.96]  fast.
[5212.96 --> 5216.80]  He will
[5216.80 --> 5218.14]  hold me
[5218.14 --> 5219.34]  fast.
[5219.34 --> 5220.80]  He will
[5220.80 --> 5222.18]  hold me
[5222.18 --> 5223.30]  fast.
[5223.30 --> 5224.24]  For
[5224.24 --> 5224.80]  thy
[5224.80 --> 5225.44]  Savior
[5225.44 --> 5226.84]  loves me
[5226.84 --> 5228.30]  so.
[5228.72 --> 5229.82]  He will
[5229.82 --> 5231.34]  hold me
[5231.34 --> 5233.02]  fast.
[5233.02 --> 5234.68]  will
[5234.68 --> 5251.60]  ensure
[5258.60 --> 5259.64]  by
[5259.64 --> 5260.78]  come
[5260.78 --> 5264.58]  God, then my soul be lost.
[5264.88 --> 5268.60]  His promises shall last.
[5269.08 --> 5273.32]  But I live and start to pass.
[5273.32 --> 5276.82]  He will hold me fast.
[5279.70 --> 5283.32]  He will hold me fast.
[5283.66 --> 5287.16]  He will hold me fast.
[5287.16 --> 5291.30]  For my Savior must be so.
[5292.36 --> 5296.60]  He will hold me fast.
[5305.62 --> 5311.38]  For my life he bled and died.
[5311.80 --> 5315.52]  Christ will hold me fast.
[5315.52 --> 5319.52]  Justice has been satisfied.
[5321.32 --> 5324.52]  He will hold me fast.
[5325.28 --> 5329.52]  Raised with him to endless life.
[5330.66 --> 5333.52]  He will hold me fast.
[5334.68 --> 5338.52]  Till our faith is turned to side.
[5338.52 --> 5342.52]  When he called and died.
[5342.52 --> 5344.52]  He will hold me fast.
[5344.52 --> 5349.52]  He will hold me fast.
[5349.52 --> 5353.52]  He will hold me fast.
[5353.52 --> 5357.52]  For my Savior loves me so.
[5357.52 --> 5361.52]  He will hold me fast.
[5361.52 --> 5363.52]  He will hold me fast.
[5363.52 --> 5368.52]  He will hold me fast.
[5368.52 --> 5372.52]  He will hold me fast.
[5372.52 --> 5376.52]  For my Savior loves me so.
[5376.52 --> 5382.52]  He will hold me fast.
[5382.52 --> 5383.52]  He will hold me fast.
[5383.52 --> 5384.52]  He will hold me fast.
[5384.52 --> 5386.52]  For my Savior loves me so.
[5386.52 --> 5388.52]  He will hold me fast.
[5388.52 --> 5389.52]  He will hold me fast.
[5389.52 --> 5402.64]  Before we receive God's blessing, just one quick word of encouragement.
[5402.64 --> 5410.64]  Everyone is invited and please welcome if you're a guest here with us, especially to stick around following our worship.
[5410.64 --> 5412.64]  We have some fellowship time.
[5412.64 --> 5414.64]  There's coffee and some refreshments.
[5414.64 --> 5416.64]  And so please stick around for that.
[5416.64 --> 5426.64]  But I encourage you, as you chat together, ask, how have you seen God this past week?
[5426.64 --> 5433.64]  Or if you get asked that question and you don't have an answer, maybe take a risk and share.
[5433.64 --> 5436.64]  This is where I need to see God.
[5436.64 --> 5441.64]  And maybe, just maybe, pray together.
[5441.64 --> 5446.64]  If you would like prayer, there's going to be someone up here after service with the name tag on.
[5446.64 --> 5449.64]  They'd love to meet you and pray with you.
[5449.64 --> 5460.64]  But as we fellowship together, make that about more than, I'm going to say, average church coffee.
[5460.64 --> 5464.64]  Make it about life and faith and hope.
[5464.64 --> 5473.64]  And then also, as you go, remember, baseball, softball is happening following service at Topham Park.
[5473.64 --> 5477.64]  We hope to throw first pitch around 1230.
[5477.64 --> 5484.64]  And so if you need to run home and get changed or the like, or Andre's already got his jersey on, so he's ready to go.
[5484.64 --> 5489.64]  Please meet us over at Topham Park there.
[5489.64 --> 5494.64]  Receive God's blessing for the week ahead.
[5494.64 --> 5498.64]  God, go before you to lead you.
[5498.64 --> 5501.64]  God, go behind you to protect you.
[5501.64 --> 5504.64]  God, go beneath you to support you.
[5504.64 --> 5507.64]  And God, go beside you to befriend you.
[5507.64 --> 5510.64]  Do not be afraid.
[5510.64 --> 5513.64]  Let the blessing of God come upon you today.
[5513.64 --> 5515.64]  Do not be afraid.
[5515.64 --> 5522.64]  But go in hope and faith to love and serve the Lord.
[5522.64 --> 5524.64]  Amen.
[5531.64 --> 5535.64]  I will go on the earth, you will wait on high.
[5535.64 --> 5543.64]  Every mountain stream, every sunset's night.
[5543.64 --> 5552.92]  Oh, Lord, we live with you, we'll reign on high
[5552.92 --> 5557.70]  Every mountain stream, every sunset sky
[5557.70 --> 5562.64]  But my one request, Lord, my holy name
[5562.64 --> 5569.80]  I'm so to reign in me, Lord, reign in me
[5569.80 --> 5574.80]  Reign in your crown, over all my dreams

[5583.02 --> 5587.02]  So you reign in me again

[5620.02 --> 5626.02]  Over all my dreams, in my darkest hour

[5635.02 --> 5636.02]  So won't you reign in me again

[5640.02 --> 5644.02]  Over all my dreams, in my darkest hour
