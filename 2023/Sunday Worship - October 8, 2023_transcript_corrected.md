[1486.04 → 1499.48] Our God is an awesome God, our God is an awesome God.
[1504.60 → 1511.04] I invite you to join your hearts and voices in a liturgy of thanksgiving through song and prayer.
[1511.04 → 1520.96] We will start by singing together Give Thanks, a song that grounds our Thanksgiving first and foremost in what God has done in Jesus for us.
[1521.90 → 1524.62] A connection and experience we now share together.
[1525.64 → 1530.18] After, we will speak a responsive liturgy together, led by the worship team.
[1530.86 → 1533.76] We encourage you to speak the words on screen indicated for you.
[1534.48 → 1536.56] And then we will finish with Give Thanks again.
[1536.56 → 1544.66] The liturgy we will share is adapted from Feasting with Friends in Every Moment Holy.
[1544.66 → 1572.76] Give thanks with a grateful heart.
[1572.76 → 1578.16] Give thanks to the Holy One.
[1578.16 → 1589.12] Give thanks because He's given Jesus Christ to the Son.
[1589.80 → 1595.18] Give thanks with a grateful heart.
[1595.62 → 1600.80] Give thanks to the Holy One.
[1600.80 → 1610.80] Give thanks because He's given Jesus Christ to the Son.
[1610.80 → 1611.80] Give thanks because He's given Jesus Christ to the Son.
[1611.80 → 1620.60] And now let the weak say I am strong.
[1620.60 → 1625.80] Let the poor say I am rich.
[1625.80 → 1655.78] Because of what the Lord has done.
[1655.78 → 1661.78] For us give thanks.
[1661.78 → 1669.96] To gather joyfully is indeed a serious affair.
[1670.78 → 1677.32] For feasting and all enjoyments gratefully taken are, at their heart, acts of war.
[1677.32 → 1678.32] For feasting and all the Lord has done.
[1678.32 → 1679.32] And now let the Lord have a great joy.
[1679.32 → 1692.32] To celebrate the Thanksgiving feast with worship, we declare that evil and death, suffering and loss, sorrow and tears, will not have the final word.
[1692.32 → 1694.32] For feasting and all the Lord have a great joy.
[1694.32 → 1714.14] The fellowship of worship, the celebrations of thanksgiving, the rumble of prayers sung and spoken with joy and laughter are the true evidences of things eternal and are the first fruits of that great glad joy that is to come and that will be unending.
[1714.14 → 1721.14] So let our Thanksgiving feast with us today.
[1721.14 → 1722.14] May this Thanksgiving feast with us today.
[1722.14 → 1726.14] May this Thanksgiving feast with us today.

[1727.14 → 1728.14] May this Thanksgiving feast with us today.
[1728.14 → 1735.26] May this Thanksgiving feast of worship, through word and table, fall like a great hammer blow against the dark night, shattering the gloom.
[1735.98 → 1741.48] We are awakening our hearts, stirring our imaginations, focusing our vision.
[1741.48 → 1754.48] May this Thanksgiving feast with us today.
[1754.48 → 1754.50] May this Thanksgiving feast with us today.
[1754.50 → 1764.00] May this Thanksgiving feast of worship be an echo of that great supper of the Lamb, a foreshadowing of the great celebration that awaits the children of God.
[1764.00 → 1773.52] May this Thanksgiving feast with us today.
[1773.56 → 1777.38] May this Thanksgiving feast with us today.

[1811.84 → 1817.20] Give thanks with a grateful heart.

[1839.26 → 1844.24] Give thanks to the Holy One.
[1844.24 → 1854.98] Give thanks because He's given Jesus Christ in His Son.
[1854.98 → 1862.86] And now let the weak say I am strong.
[1863.18 → 1868.22] Let the poor say I am rich.
[1868.22 → 1876.22] Because of what the Lord has done for us.
[1876.96 → 1884.22] And now let the weak say I am strong.
[1884.22 → 1889.72] Let the poor say I am rich.
[1889.96 → 1898.56] Because of what the Lord has done for us.
[1898.56 → 1902.64] Give thanks.
[1902.64 → 1930.64] Thank you for saving me.
[1930.64 → 1935.64] What can I say?
[1935.64 → 1942.52] You are my everything.
[1942.52 → 1948.52] I will sing your praise.
[1948.52 → 1955.26] You shed your blood for me.
[1955.26 → 1960.52] What can I say?
[1960.52 → 1967.52] You took my sin and shame.
[1967.52 → 1972.52] A sinner called my name.
[1972.52 → 1985.52] Great is the Lord.
[1985.52 → 1995.52] Great is the Lord.
[1995.52 → 1997.52] God.
[1997.52 → 2000.52] For we know your truth.
[2000.52 → 2005.52] The set must be.
[2005.52 → 2018.52] You set your hope in me.
[2018.52 → 2019.52] God is with the Lord.
[2019.52 → 2021.52] God is with you.
[2021.52 → 2022.52] God is with us.
[2022.52 → 2023.52] God is with us.
[2023.52 → 2025.52] For me and grace are mine.
[2025.52 → 2026.52] God is with us.
[2026.52 → 2027.52] For me and grace are mine.
[2027.52 → 2031.52] For forgiven is my sin.
[2031.52 → 2038.20] Jesus my only Lord
[2038.20 → 2043.32] Saviour of the world
[2043.32 → 2049.64] Great is the Lord we cry

[2097.16 → 2106.38] You set your home
[2106.38 → 2108.38] In me
[2108.38 → 2118.38] Thank you for saving me
[2118.38 → 2123.60] What can I say
[2123.60 → 2134.82] When I'm found of every blessing
[2134.82 → 2138.04] Give me the Lord
[2138.04 → 2140.04] Give me the Lord
[2140.04 → 2141.04] Give me the Lord
[2141.04 → 2142.04] Give me the Lord
[2142.04 → 2148.04] And I'll count of every blessing
[2148.04 → 2153.04] Tick my heart to sing thy praise
[2153.04 → 2158.20] Saints of mercy, mercy, sing
[2158.20 → 2163.42] Call for songs of loudest praise
[2163.42 → 2167.42] Teach me so, God, how you saw it
[2167.42 → 2172.42] Stuck my faith in tongues of God
[2172.42 → 2177.42] Raise the mountain, face upon it
[2177.42 → 2181.42] Mount of thy holy divine
[2181.42 → 2190.64] Here I raise my Ebenezer
[2190.64 → 2194.64] Hither by thy help I come
[2194.64 → 2200.52] And I hope by thy good pleasure
[2200.52 → 2205.74] Safely to arrive at home
[2205.74 → 2210.74] Jesus sought me when a stranger
[2210.74 → 2215.50] Wandering from the fold of God
[2215.50 → 2220.60] He to rescue me from danger
[2221.74 → 2225.74] Interposed his precious blood
[2225.74 → 2233.22] Prove to grace, how great a debtor
[2233.22 → 2237.82] Daily I am constrained to thee
[2237.82 → 2243.02] Let thy grace, like a feather
[2243.02 → 2247.96] Bind my one great heart to thee
[2247.96 → 2253.18] Prove to wonder, Lord, I feel it
[2253.18 → 2257.62] Prove to leave the God alone
[2257.62 → 2262.98] Here's my heart, Lord, take and steal it
[2262.98 → 2267.40] Seal it for thy courts above
[2267.40 → 2275.16] Come, thou fount of every blessing
[2275.16 → 2280.00] Tune my heart to sing thy praise
[2280.00 → 2285.02] Streams of mercy never ceasing
[2285.02 → 2289.80] Call for songs of loudest praise
[2289.80 → 2294.80] Teach me so, God, how you saw it
[2294.80 → 2299.32] From thy waving tongues above
[2299.32 → 2304.00] Raise the mountain, face upon it
[2304.00 → 2309.00] Mount of thy redeeming love
[2309.00 → 2314.74] Fade the mountain, face upon it
[2314.74 → 2321.00] Mount of thy redeeming love
[2321.00 → 2322.92] I invite you to receive it
[2322.92 → 2347.72] Good morning
[2347.72 → 2349.50] Happy Thanksgiving
[2349.50 → 2353.84] The first offering is for the church
[2353.84 → 2356.42] Budget and today's special offering
[2356.42 → 2358.06] Is for the Langley Food Bank
[2358.06 → 2360.44] An organization that is close to
[2360.44 → 2361.74] This congregation's heart
[2361.74 → 2364.60] This past summer we held a food drive
[2364.60 → 2366.48] Along with our community fair
[2366.48 → 2369.14] And many in this church family
[2369.14 → 2370.24] Help out there
[2370.24 → 2373.38] Today we have a chance to help out
[2373.38 → 2374.78] This ministry financially
[2374.78 → 2378.96] Sadly, the number of families seeking basic groceries
[2378.96 → 2382.40] And supplies has increased in the past year
[2382.40 → 2384.84] Due to the current economic climate
[2384.84 → 2388.66] But more than food provisions
[2388.66 → 2394.32] The Food Bank offers kindness, conversations, and relational connections to prayer
[2394.32 → 2396.48] Local churches, and more
[2396.48 → 2399.20] Our support helps make this happen
[2399.20 → 2402.64] Thank you for giving as the Lord leads
[2402.64 → 2407.70] Just a reminder that all donations and the offering bags
[2407.70 → 2410.86] Will go to the food bank unless otherwise designated
[2410.86 → 2411.66] Thank you
[2411.66 → 2411.88] Thank you
[2411.88 → 2413.04] Thank you
[2413.04 → 2413.60] Thank you
[2413.60 → 2425.80] Thank you
[2425.80 → 2427.12] Thank you
[2427.12 → 2427.86] Thank you
[2427.86 → 2450.58] I will offer up my life in spirit and truth
[2450.58 → 2457.42] Pouring out the oil of love as my worship to you
[2457.42 → 2464.52] Be surrender, I must give my every heart
[2464.52 → 2471.46] Lord, receive the sacrifice of a broken heart
[2471.46 → 2478.28] Jesus, what can I give? What can I bring?
[2478.28 → 2484.88] Too so faithful a friend, too so loving a king
[2484.88 → 2491.78] Saviour, what can be said? What can be sung?
[2492.26 → 2498.42] As the praise of your name, all the things you have done
[2498.42 → 2506.32] All my words could not tell, not even in part
[2506.32 → 2515.90] Of the debt of love that is owed by this thankful heart
[2515.90 → 2528.64] You deserve my every breath, for you paid the great cost
[2528.64 → 2535.24] Giving up your life to death, even death on a cross
[2535.24 → 2541.80] You took all my shame away, and you flee in my sin
[2541.80 → 2548.40] Open up the days of grace, and they'll beckon me in
[2548.40 → 2554.94] Jesus, what can I give? What can I bring?
[2554.94 → 2561.54] You so faithful a friend, too so loving a king
[2561.54 → 2568.22] Saviour, what can be said? What can be sung?
[2568.22 → 2574.72] As the praise of your name, all the things you have done
[2574.72 → 2582.10] All my words could not tell, not even in part
[2582.10 → 2588.36] Of the debt of love that is owed
[2588.36 → 2594.74] Of the debt of love that is owed
[2594.74 → 2601.78] Of the debt of love that is owed
[2601.78 → 2605.28] By this thankful heart
[2605.28 → 2632.54] Good morning, everyone. If you are age three up into grade four, I'd like to invite you to come up front for a minute for Kids Corner.
[2635.28 → 2643.88] Happy Thanksgiving to everybody
[2643.88 → 2650.06] So I thought we'd just start up here by just thinking of some things we're thankful for
[2650.06 → 2652.38] Since it's Thanksgiving, and we've been talking about that
[2652.38 → 2654.82] Probably at school, or maybe even at home
[2654.82 → 2657.04] Does anyone have something they could share?
[2657.18 → 2658.50] Something that you're thankful for?
[2659.50 → 2659.98] Malachi?
[2659.98 → 2660.12] Malachi?
[2660.12 → 2667.12] The food you eat. Excellent. I have to agree with that, too. Yes, Karis?
[2668.72 → 2673.84] For your family. Maybe some of you are thinking, oh, I'm thankful for those things, too. Does anyone else have an idea?
[2673.84 → 2675.08] Nail?
[2675.08 → 2677.18] For your friends?
[2677.18 → 2678.26] Yeah.
[2678.26 → 2679.86] Yes.
[2679.86 → 2683.10] Family? You guys have such great answers.
[2683.10 → 2689.22] So today in children's worship, we're going to talk about something I'm thankful for, which is peace
[2689.22 → 2691.84] Now we can think of peace
[2691.84 → 2695.34] About ourselves, like things that make ourselves feel peaceful
[2695.34 → 2698.26] Maybe there's what we'll talk about there, so I won't give you too many ideas
[2698.26 → 2699.86] But how can you be peaceful yourself?
[2699.86 → 2703.26] But what does peace also look like in your family, with your friends
[2703.26 → 2707.12] In our city or your school and in our world?
[2707.12 → 2709.74] And what does God say about peace in the Bible?
[2710.34 → 2712.38] So that will be our theme today as we go
[2712.38 → 2714.98] But before, I'd like you guys to stand up
[2714.98 → 2719.12] Will everyone please stand up, and we'll do the children's blessing
[2719.12 → 2720.12] Amen
[2720.12 → 2724.12] Amen
[2724.12 → 2728.12] Amen
[2728.12 → 2730.12] Amen
[2730.12 → 2732.12] Amen
[2732.12 → 2734.12] Amen
[2734.12 → 2736.12] Amen
[2736.12 → 2737.10] Amen
[2737.10 → 2767.08] Amen
[2767.08 → 2770.90] I'd like to invite you to pray together with me in our family prayer
[2770.90 → 2779.50] Gracious Heavenly Father
[2779.50 → 2782.86] You are our sovereign God
[2782.86 → 2784.90] Who created all things for our
[2784.90 → 2786.06] For your pleasure
[2786.06 → 2788.80] And who gives us all life
[2788.80 → 2789.56] Breath
[2789.56 → 2791.34] And every good thing
[2791.34 → 2794.34] We thank you for the world you created
[2794.34 → 2795.20] Which we live
[2795.20 → 2795.94] Lord
[2795.94 → 2796.04] Lord
[2796.04 → 2799.28] We have the privilege to live in this beautiful place
[2799.28 → 2803.10] We only have to look around us to see your handiwork
[2803.10 → 2808.84] We give thanks for all of this world and its immense beauty
[2808.84 → 2811.42] Its staggering strength
[2811.42 → 2816.30] Its heights and depths and breaths of it
[2816.30 → 2819.00] Beyond our knowing
[2819.00 → 2821.94] And yet
[2821.94 → 2822.02] And yet
[2822.02 → 2824.24] You know it
[2824.24 → 2826.00] You know us
[2826.00 → 2828.58] You have made yourself known
[2828.58 → 2833.08] For the abundance of the gifts you give us
[2833.08 → 2834.18] We thank you
[2834.18 → 2835.56] For the sun
[2835.56 → 2837.10] For the rains
[2837.10 → 2838.94] That allow the land to flourish
[2838.94 → 2841.06] Your blessings
[2841.06 → 2842.08] Poured out
[2842.08 → 2844.38] On each one of us
[2844.38 → 2845.68] Regardless of what we do
[2845.68 → 2845.70] Regardless of what we do
[2845.70 → 2846.94] And how we live our lives
[2846.94 → 2850.10] We thank you
[2850.10 → 2853.06] Also in times of disappointments
[2853.06 → 2855.14] And failures that lead us to the knowledge
[2855.14 → 2857.86] And of that
[2857.86 → 2859.48] We depend on you alone
[2859.48 → 2862.26] And especially we thank you
[2862.26 → 2863.60] For your saving grace
[2863.60 → 2865.64] That you've shown us
[2865.64 → 2866.34] Through your son
[2866.34 → 2867.22] Jesus Christ
[2867.22 → 2869.66] Open our hearts
[2869.66 → 2872.20] So that we allow your spirit to lead us
[2872.20 → 2874.90] So that we may walk in your ways
[2874.90 → 2878.44] With your spirit help us to pray
[2878.44 → 2881.02] Because we don't know how to pray as we should
[2881.02 → 2883.68] But intercede for us
[2883.68 → 2886.24] With sighs too deep for words
[2886.24 → 2891.98] Father we give you thanks for bringing us together as a church
[2891.98 → 2896.40] We pray that you would bless us in our worship
[2896.40 → 2898.76] Bless us in our fellowship
[2898.76 → 2902.68] We give you thanks for this place to meet
[2902.68 → 2905.44] That has been provided for us
[2905.44 → 2907.88] We thank you
[2907.88 → 2908.72] Oh God
[2908.72 → 2910.92] For Christ's church
[2910.92 → 2911.74] As we know it
[2911.74 → 2913.22] And see it throughout the world
[2913.22 → 2915.38] And pray for your blessing on it
[2915.38 → 2919.24] Thank you for your mercy and grace
[2919.24 → 2921.34] For always being there when we need you
[2921.34 → 2923.28] When the days are long
[2923.28 → 2924.74] And our troubles heavy
[2924.74 → 2926.34] You are there
[2926.34 → 2927.80] To walk beside us
[2927.80 → 2931.42] We have all come with individual
[2931.42 → 2932.68] And personal needs
[2932.68 → 2934.52] Needs that we may not have shared
[2934.52 → 2935.48] With anyone else
[2935.48 → 2937.12] But you know us
[2937.12 → 2938.36] And the struggles
[2938.36 → 2939.86] And the burdens we are facing
[2939.86 → 2943.78] We especially think of
[2943.78 → 2945.04] And pray for Judy Dijkstra
[2945.04 → 2947.64] As she continues to deal with health issues
[2947.64 → 2951.28] Lord we pray also for Rose Vita
[2951.28 → 2953.62] Who's having a difficult time right now
[2953.62 → 2956.88] We ask that you will give healing and comfort
[2956.88 → 2965.34] We pray for students that are travelling to and from school for this weekend
[2965.34 → 2966.72] To be with family
[2966.72 → 2970.72] We pray for Klaus Tastemaker
[2970.72 → 2973.36] And Amanda and Ken and the kids
[2973.36 → 2975.24] And their extended family and friends
[2975.24 → 2976.50] Through this time of mourning
[2976.50 → 2978.16] Of Thelma
[2978.16 → 2982.82] We pray for those who are struggling with relationships
[2982.82 → 2983.88] And grief
[2983.88 → 2987.28] Or other issues
[2987.28 → 2989.92] Lord we ask that you will continue to bless
[2989.92 → 2991.02] And give comfort
[2991.02 → 2993.20] And grace and strength where it's needed
[2993.20 → 2997.02] And Lord we think of the war and strife
[2997.02 → 2997.76] In the Middle East
[2997.76 → 3000.00] And we pray for peace
[3000.00 → 3003.16] And we pray that it may come quickly
[3003.16 → 3008.92] We ask for your protection on this congregation
[3008.92 → 3011.86] We pray that you will continue to bless
[3011.86 → 3013.98] The ongoing ministries of this church
[3013.98 → 3016.96] Sustain us in the present
[3016.96 → 3019.08] And guide us into the future
[3019.08 → 3022.80] As we hear your word for us this morning
[3022.80 → 3026.24] Through the word preached by Pastor Chris
[3026.24 → 3029.40] Bind us together in Christ
[3029.40 → 3032.28] Keep us focused on the purpose
[3032.28 → 3036.28] And fill us with your Holy Spirit
[3036.28 → 3041.16] We pray that we will grow in love and truth
[3041.16 → 3043.12] Righteousness and peace
[3043.12 → 3044.70] Hope and faith
[3044.70 → 3047.50] Help us to grow in Jesus
[3047.50 → 3050.38] That we may become more and more like him
[3050.38 → 3052.96] In character and in soul
[3052.96 → 3057.24] Fulfill your will and purposes through us
[3057.24 → 3059.38] Advance your kingdom
[3059.38 → 3061.20] Through us
[3061.20 → 3063.88] So that your Holy Name is glorified
[3063.88 → 3066.56] Who are we
[3066.56 → 3068.32] That we should share
[3068.32 → 3070.00] In your love and tender care
[3070.00 → 3072.46] Raised to an exalted height
[3072.46 → 3074.46] And crowned with honour
[3074.46 → 3075.86] In your sight
[3075.86 → 3078.58] How great your name
[3078.58 → 3081.18] Come quickly Lord
[3081.18 → 3083.98] And bring our redemption to completeness
[3083.98 → 3087.50] We pray for all these things
[3087.50 → 3088.92] In your Holy Name
[3088.92 → 3090.22] Amen
[3090.22 → 3111.98] As you can see on the screen behind you
[3111.98 → 3114.08] We're going to read together this morning
[3114.08 → 3115.74] From Luke 17
[3115.74 → 3118.60] Verse 11 through 19
[3118.60 → 3120.42] Before we do that
[3120.42 → 3121.50] Let me just say
[3121.50 → 3122.98] It is good to be with you
[3122.98 → 3123.56] Again
[3123.56 → 3125.80] If you were not here last week
[3125.80 → 3128.20] I also was not here last week
[3128.20 → 3129.92] I was preaching at Living Hope
[3129.92 → 3130.58] And that was very
[3130.58 → 3132.08] Pastor Steve was here
[3132.08 → 3134.94] And he is grateful for you
[3134.94 → 3136.06] And for his time here
[3136.06 → 3136.88] And his celebration
[3136.88 → 3140.04] I had an excellent time at Living Hope
[3140.04 → 3141.08] But I was reminded
[3141.08 → 3142.26] While I was there
[3142.26 → 3144.30] Just how grateful I am for you guys
[3144.30 → 3146.48] And for our church family here
[3146.48 → 3147.28] And the community
[3147.28 → 3148.56] And culture
[3148.56 → 3149.82] That we have
[3149.82 → 3151.56] Built together
[3151.56 → 3152.58] And so
[3152.58 → 3154.38] This Thanksgiving weekend
[3154.38 → 3155.26] Let me just say
[3155.26 → 3156.26] That one of the things
[3156.26 → 3157.60] I am thankful for
[3157.60 → 3158.32] Is you
[3158.32 → 3159.86] And for our time together
[3159.86 → 3163.50] Let's read
[3163.50 → 3165.58] From Luke 17
[3165.58 → 3166.46] Together
[3166.46 → 3168.80] I'm going to start at verse 11
[3168.80 → 3172.00] Now
[3172.00 → 3173.14] On his way
[3173.14 → 3173.90] To Jerusalem
[3173.90 → 3175.62] Jesus travelled
[3175.62 → 3176.74] Along the border
[3176.74 → 3177.88] Between Samaria
[3177.88 → 3178.78] And Galilee
[3178.78 → 3180.94] As he was going
[3180.94 → 3181.94] Into a village
[3181.94 → 3182.72] Ten men
[3182.72 → 3183.76] Who had leprosy
[3183.76 → 3184.36] Met him
[3184.36 → 3186.28] They stood at a distance
[3186.28 → 3187.26] And called out
[3187.26 → 3188.10] In a loud voice
[3188.10 → 3188.88] Jesus
[3188.88 → 3189.62] Master
[3189.62 → 3191.06] Have pity on us
[3191.06 → 3193.40] When he saw them
[3193.40 → 3194.06] He said
[3194.06 → 3195.00] Go
[3195.00 → 3196.08] Show yourselves
[3196.08 → 3197.20] To the priests
[3197.20 → 3199.26] And as they went
[3199.26 → 3200.90] They were cleansed
[3200.90 → 3203.50] Now one of them
[3203.50 → 3204.44] When he saw
[3204.44 → 3205.28] He was healed
[3205.28 → 3206.34] Came back
[3206.34 → 3207.58] Praising God
[3207.58 → 3208.60] In a loud voice
[3208.60 → 3209.64] He threw himself
[3209.64 → 3210.68] At Jesus' feet
[3210.68 → 3211.86] And thanked him
[3211.86 → 3214.02] And he was a Samaritan
[3214.02 → 3216.20] Jesus asked
[3216.20 → 3217.54] Were not all ten
[3217.54 → 3218.40] Cleansed?
[3218.40 → 3219.16] Where are you
[3219.16 → 3220.16] And he said
[3220.16 → 3220.92] Has no one
[3220.92 → 3222.16] Returned to give praise
[3222.16 → 3222.66] To God
[3222.66 → 3223.80] Except for this
[3223.80 → 3224.58] Foreigner?
[3225.30 → 3225.94] And then he said
[3225.94 → 3226.30] To him
[3226.30 → 3227.88] Rise and go
[3227.88 → 3229.22] For your faith
[3229.22 → 3230.44] Has made you
[3230.44 → 3231.24] Well
[3231.24 → 3232.92] This is the word
[3232.92 → 3233.36] Lord
[3233.36 → 3240.36] As it is
[3240.36 → 3241.26] Thanksgiving
[3241.26 → 3242.86] We can
[3242.86 → 3244.06] It's probable
[3244.06 → 3244.88] That you're going
[3244.88 → 3245.72] To gather
[3245.72 → 3246.46] With family
[3246.46 → 3247.36] With friends
[3247.36 → 3247.88] With group
[3247.88 → 3248.52] Of people
[3248.52 → 3249.86] And maybe
[3249.86 → 3250.74] You have
[3250.74 → 3251.60] Particular
[3251.60 → 3252.74] Thanksgiving
[3252.74 → 3253.74] Traditions
[3253.74 → 3255.18] In your family
[3255.18 → 3256.76] Maybe you're
[3256.76 → 3257.74] One of those
[3257.74 → 3258.70] Groups of people
[3258.70 → 3260.26] Who go around
[3260.26 → 3260.90] The table
[3260.90 → 3262.14] Before everyone
[3262.14 → 3262.62] Is allowed
[3262.62 → 3263.20] To eat
[3263.20 → 3263.74] And you have
[3263.74 → 3264.48] To give something
[3264.48 → 3265.28] That you're thankful
[3265.28 → 3265.70] For
[3265.70 → 3266.46] And then if you
[3266.46 → 3267.00] Have more than
[3267.00 → 3267.64] Four people
[3267.64 → 3268.24] At the table
[3268.24 → 3268.80] By the time
[3268.80 → 3269.28] You get to the
[3269.28 → 3269.82] Fifth one
[3269.82 → 3270.84] You're recycling
[3270.84 → 3271.72] All things
[3271.72 → 3272.20] And nobody
[3272.20 → 3272.92] Meals original
[3272.92 → 3273.42] Anymore
[3273.42 → 3273.98] And they get to
[3273.98 → 3274.46] You at the end
[3274.46 → 3274.76] You're like
[3274.76 → 3277.04] You guys have
[3277.04 → 3277.68] Said all the cool
[3277.68 → 3278.10] Things
[3278.10 → 3279.94] I'm thankful
[3279.94 → 3281.06] For this food
[3281.06 → 3282.44] Or
[3282.44 → 3282.96] I'm thankful
[3282.96 → 3283.66] For my mom and
[3283.66 → 3284.00] Dad
[3284.00 → 3285.24] Mom and dad
[3285.24 → 3285.88] Usually end up
[3285.88 → 3286.48] Down the bottom
[3286.48 → 3286.92] Of the list
[3286.92 → 3287.38] Somewhere
[3287.38 → 3289.68] Maybe your
[3289.68 → 3290.84] Tradition is
[3290.84 → 3291.34] To
[3291.34 → 3293.42] Eat so much
[3293.42 → 3294.24] And then have
[3294.24 → 3295.32] A three-hour nap
[3295.32 → 3296.12] While magically
[3296.12 → 3296.84] Everything is
[3296.84 → 3297.32] Cleared up
[3297.32 → 3297.90] Afterwards
[3297.90 → 3301.28] Maybe your
[3301.28 → 3302.12] Tradition is
[3302.12 → 3302.92] To go out
[3302.92 → 3303.64] And play
[3303.64 → 3304.26] Cash
[3304.26 → 3305.24] Or football
[3305.24 → 3306.08] Or something
[3306.08 → 3307.90] With your
[3307.90 → 3308.42] Family
[3308.42 → 3309.24] And friends
[3309.24 → 3310.72] Maybe your
[3310.72 → 3311.20] Tradition is
[3311.20 → 3311.58] To go for
[3311.58 → 3311.88] Hive
[3311.88 → 3313.94] I recently
[3313.94 → 3315.60] Follow this
[3315.60 → 3316.24] Account on
[3316.24 → 3316.66] Instagram
[3316.66 → 3317.70] Outdoors
[3317.70 → 3318.18] Account
[3318.18 → 3318.74] Anybody
[3318.74 → 3319.00] They're
[3319.00 → 3319.42] Showing
[3319.42 → 3320.28] Beautiful
[3320.28 → 3320.70] Pictures
[3320.70 → 3321.24] And videos
[3321.24 → 3322.14] Of these
[3322.14 → 3322.90] Massive
[3322.90 → 3323.70] Landscapes
[3323.70 → 3324.36] Mountainous
[3324.36 → 3326.36] Forested
[3326.36 → 3326.92] And there's
[3326.92 → 3327.62] No people
[3327.62 → 3327.94] There
[3327.94 → 3328.28] And they
[3328.28 → 3328.48] Said
[3328.48 → 3329.08] Have you ever
[3329.08 → 3329.52] Noticed
[3329.52 → 3329.88] That the
[3329.88 → 3330.60] Further you
[3330.60 → 3331.16] Get from
[3331.16 → 3331.60] People
[3331.60 → 3332.46] The better
[3332.46 → 3332.96] You feel
[3332.96 → 3334.56] Maybe that's
[3334.56 → 3335.06] Thanksgiving
[3335.06 → 3335.18] Thanksgiving
[3335.18 → 3336.02] To be
[3336.02 → 3336.44] Alone
[3336.44 → 3337.72] Just leave
[3337.72 → 3338.40] Me alone
[3338.40 → 3339.66] Maybe that's
[3339.66 → 3340.06] Your tradition
[3340.06 → 3341.80] We all have
[3341.80 → 3342.42] These kinds
[3342.42 → 3342.90] Of traditions
[3342.90 → 3343.36] And to be
[3343.36 → 3343.76] Honest
[3343.76 → 3344.38] It's not
[3344.38 → 3344.96] Particularly
[3344.96 → 3345.88] A Christian
[3345.88 → 3347.32] To have
[3347.32 → 3347.82] These kinds
[3347.82 → 3348.38] Of traditions
[3348.38 → 3349.54] Right
[3349.54 → 3350.74] Thanksgiving
[3350.74 → 3351.82] And at least
[3351.82 → 3352.56] North America
[3352.56 → 3354.20] Is a cultural
[3354.20 → 3355.42] Practice
[3355.42 → 3359.62] What I hope
[3359.62 → 3360.22] We will see
[3360.22 → 3360.86] This morning
[3360.86 → 3362.24] Though
[3362.24 → 3362.80] Is that
[3362.80 → 3363.52] There ought to be
[3363.52 → 3364.76] Something distinct
[3364.76 → 3366.06] About our
[3366.06 → 3367.08] Thanksgiving
[3367.08 → 3369.12] Now our focus
[3369.12 → 3369.66] This morning
[3369.66 → 3370.32] Is going to come
[3370.32 → 3371.28] From verse
[3371.28 → 3372.02] 15
[3372.02 → 3372.84] Primarily
[3372.84 → 3373.78] Although we will
[3373.78 → 3374.48] Of course look
[3374.48 → 3375.04] And bounce
[3375.04 → 3375.56] Through all
[3375.56 → 3375.96] Of what we
[3375.96 → 3376.22] Read
[3376.22 → 3377.46] But the
[3377.46 → 3378.38] Principle
[3378.38 → 3379.04] That I would
[3379.04 → 3379.74] Like us to
[3379.74 → 3380.32] See
[3380.32 → 3381.08] At work
[3381.08 → 3381.48] In this
[3381.48 → 3381.82] Text
[3381.82 → 3382.16] And then
[3382.16 → 3382.92] In application
[3382.92 → 3383.58] For our
[3383.58 → 3384.02] Lives
[3384.02 → 3384.54] Is this
[3384.54 → 3385.98] That though
[3385.98 → 3386.60] Thanksgiving
[3386.60 → 3387.88] Isn't distinctly
[3387.88 → 3388.50] Christian
[3388.50 → 3389.32] Or Thanksgiving
[3389.32 → 3390.40] Isn't distinctly
[3390.40 → 3390.84] Christian
[3390.84 → 3392.26] But giving
[3392.26 → 3393.02] Thanks
[3393.02 → 3394.44] Is a distinctive
[3394.44 → 3396.90] Of the true
[3396.90 → 3397.66] Christian
[3397.66 → 3400.36] Now to set
[3400.36 → 3400.68] That up
[3400.68 → 3401.14] Let's read
[3401.14 → 3402.08] Verse 15
[3402.08 → 3403.06] Again
[3403.06 → 3404.46] Verse 15
[3404.46 → 3404.90] Says
[3404.90 → 3406.40] One of them
[3406.40 → 3407.34] When he saw
[3407.34 → 3408.22] He was healed
[3408.22 → 3409.30] Came back
[3409.30 → 3410.48] Praising God
[3410.48 → 3411.10] In a loud
[3411.10 → 3411.92] Voice
[3411.92 → 3412.56] He threw
[3412.56 → 3412.94] Himself
[3412.94 → 3413.78] At the feet
[3413.78 → 3414.76] Of Jesus
[3414.76 → 3415.70] At Jesus' feet
[3415.70 → 3416.78] And thanked him
[3416.78 → 3418.24] And then Jesus
[3418.24 → 3418.88] Picks up
[3418.88 → 3419.48] On this
[3419.48 → 3420.40] Thanksgiving
[3420.40 → 3421.06] Again
[3421.06 → 3422.08] In verse 18
[3422.08 → 3423.00] Where Jesus
[3423.00 → 3423.28] Says
[3423.28 → 3424.00] Has no one
[3424.00 → 3424.68] Returned
[3424.68 → 3425.88] To praise God
[3425.88 → 3426.38] Except
[3426.38 → 3427.20] This
[3427.20 → 3427.98] Forward
[3427.98 → 3430.68] Now there's a lot
[3430.68 → 3431.40] Going on in this
[3431.40 → 3432.00] Text that we can
[3432.00 → 3432.78] Spend our time
[3432.78 → 3433.06] With
[3433.06 → 3433.76] But I want to
[3433.76 → 3434.24] Notice
[3434.24 → 3435.28] A couple
[3435.28 → 3436.32] Two things
[3436.32 → 3437.28] With you
[3437.28 → 3438.48] This morning
[3438.48 → 3439.76] First
[3439.76 → 3440.32] Notice
[3440.32 → 3441.68] That this man
[3441.68 → 3442.92] And Jesus
[3442.92 → 3444.26] Connect
[3444.26 → 3445.14] Together
[3445.14 → 3446.62] Praising God
[3446.62 → 3447.82] Thanking Jesus
[3447.82 → 3449.20] And then returning
[3449.20 → 3450.42] To praise God
[3450.42 → 3451.72] While at Jesus' feet
[3451.72 → 3454.26] Someone
[3454.26 → 3455.48] Shared a video
[3455.48 → 3455.96] With me
[3455.96 → 3456.50] Recently
[3456.50 → 3457.98] About a person
[3457.98 → 3458.84] Who was
[3458.84 → 3459.70] Kind of
[3459.70 → 3461.58] Walking around
[3461.58 → 3462.30] In a public
[3462.30 → 3463.30] Area
[3463.30 → 3464.16] I think it might have been
[3464.16 → 3465.06] A Christian university
[3465.06 → 3465.66] Actually
[3465.66 → 3467.84] And this person
[3467.84 → 3468.62] Was challenging
[3468.62 → 3469.30] Christians
[3469.30 → 3470.76] On these commonly held
[3470.76 → 3471.20] Beliefs
[3471.20 → 3471.90] And in the video
[3471.90 → 3473.04] This person
[3473.04 → 3473.88] Would walk up to
[3473.88 → 3475.20] A professing Christian
[3475.20 → 3476.18] And they would say
[3476.18 → 3477.32] Here's a Bible
[3477.32 → 3478.56] Show me
[3478.56 → 3479.28] In the Bible
[3479.28 → 3479.98] Where Jesus
[3479.98 → 3480.70] Says
[3480.70 → 3481.74] That he is God
[3481.74 → 3483.62] And then
[3483.62 → 3484.24] Under the mounting
[3484.24 → 3484.86] Pressure
[3484.86 → 3485.42] Of someone
[3485.42 → 3486.32] Like standing
[3486.32 → 3487.14] Right in front of them
[3487.14 → 3487.78] And forcing them
[3487.78 → 3488.90] To think on their toes
[3488.90 → 3490.28] And challenging them
[3490.28 → 3491.12] They can't do it
[3491.12 → 3491.62] Or at least
[3491.62 → 3492.30] In the particular
[3492.30 → 3493.38] Edits of the video
[3493.38 → 3493.96] That ends up
[3493.96 → 3494.64] On social media
[3494.64 → 3495.74] They can't do it
[3495.74 → 3497.60] And then the person
[3497.60 → 3498.44] In the video
[3498.44 → 3499.22] Concludes
[3499.22 → 3499.68] See
[3499.68 → 3501.00] Even Jesus
[3501.00 → 3501.58] Didn't think
[3501.58 → 3502.24] He was God
[3502.24 → 3503.84] But
[3503.84 → 3504.26] Even just
[3504.26 → 3505.18] From this text
[3505.18 → 3506.92] The way that Luke
[3506.92 → 3507.46] Is writing
[3507.46 → 3509.06] He's setting up
[3509.06 → 3510.20] What you might call
[3510.20 → 3510.92] The grammatical
[3510.92 → 3511.80] Equivalency
[3511.80 → 3512.76] And so notice
[3512.76 → 3513.30] The character
[3513.30 → 3515.52] The man returns
[3515.52 → 3516.78] Praising God
[3516.78 → 3518.28] He throws himself
[3518.28 → 3519.58] At Jesus' feet
[3519.58 → 3520.96] And then Jesus says
[3520.96 → 3522.54] Only one returned
[3522.54 → 3523.98] To give praise to God
[3523.98 → 3525.26] Right
[3525.26 → 3526.50] He is praising
[3526.50 → 3527.80] And giving thanks
[3527.80 → 3529.06] At the foot of God
[3529.06 → 3530.40] Who we see
[3530.40 → 3531.32] Is named Jesus
[3531.32 → 3534.56] Jesus is God
[3534.56 → 3537.18] Now the second thing
[3537.18 → 3538.06] Out of that
[3538.06 → 3538.42] Right
[3538.42 → 3539.38] Is notice
[3539.38 → 3540.74] What is distinct
[3540.74 → 3542.84] About this man
[3542.84 → 3545.64] He is the only one
[3545.64 → 3546.66] Who comes back
[3546.66 → 3547.78] To worship God
[3547.78 → 3549.38] And to thank him
[3549.38 → 3550.74] Right
[3550.74 → 3551.56] All of them
[3551.56 → 3553.60] Were healed physically
[3553.60 → 3554.38] Right
[3554.38 → 3555.54] The text tells us
[3555.54 → 3556.12] Very carefully
[3556.12 → 3558.52] They were cleansed
[3558.52 → 3559.98] Now that word
[3559.98 → 3560.88] Cleansed
[3560.88 → 3562.18] Is a neat word
[3562.18 → 3562.88] In Greek
[3562.88 → 3564.82] The word in Greek
[3564.82 → 3566.18] Is Josh
[3566.18 → 3566.70] Is the only one
[3566.70 → 3567.22] Who's going to care
[3567.22 → 3567.96] About this right now
[3567.96 → 3568.76] Is Katherine
[3568.76 → 3570.12] Josh is studying
[3570.12 → 3571.46] Greek in seminary
[3571.46 → 3571.90] Right now
[3571.90 → 3572.36] So I was going to
[3572.36 → 3573.38] Ask him to translate that
[3573.38 → 3573.84] But I didn't want
[3573.84 → 3574.70] To put him on the spot
[3574.70 → 3576.84] Didn't know
[3576.84 → 3577.28] Yeah see
[3577.28 → 3577.96] There you go
[3577.96 → 3579.38] Chorizo
[3579.38 → 3581.40] Is a word
[3581.40 → 3581.44] Is a word
[3581.44 → 3582.64] That is used
[3582.64 → 3583.94] It means cleansing
[3583.94 → 3584.84] Or healing
[3584.84 → 3585.56] When it's used
[3585.56 → 3587.16] Of people with leprosy
[3587.16 → 3588.46] It means to heal
[3588.46 → 3590.00] Because lepers
[3590.00 → 3591.84] Are considered unclean
[3591.84 → 3593.32] By the Levitical law
[3593.32 → 3594.12] Right
[3594.12 → 3594.94] The Levitical law
[3594.94 → 3596.10] Given in the Old Testament
[3596.10 → 3598.20] Found in Leviticus 13
[3598.20 → 3599.14] Verse 45
[3599.14 → 3599.86] Numbers 5
[3599.86 → 3600.40] Verses 2
[3600.40 → 3600.86] And 3
[3600.86 → 3603.76] Declares lepers unclean
[3603.76 → 3605.08] That's why Jesus
[3605.08 → 3606.84] When he walks to the village
[3606.84 → 3608.58] Leaves these people outside
[3608.58 → 3609.96] Because they're not
[3609.96 → 3610.90] Allowed to be part
[3610.90 → 3611.78] Of the normal
[3611.78 → 3612.98] Gathering people
[3612.98 → 3613.94] That's why
[3613.94 → 3614.70] Even when Jesus
[3614.70 → 3615.62] Approaches them
[3615.62 → 3617.32] They stand at a distance
[3617.32 → 3618.44] And have to call out
[3618.44 → 3619.36] In a loud voice
[3619.36 → 3620.62] Because they can't
[3620.62 → 3621.24] Get close
[3621.24 → 3622.48] To Jesus
[3622.48 → 3624.26] Ceremonial law
[3624.26 → 3625.40] Forbid there be
[3625.40 → 3626.54] Inside the village
[3626.54 → 3627.96] And near others
[3627.96 → 3629.20] That's also why
[3629.20 → 3629.88] When Jesus
[3629.88 → 3631.32] Speaks to them
[3631.32 → 3631.68] He says
[3631.68 → 3632.74] Go present yourselves
[3632.74 → 3633.54] To the priest
[3633.54 → 3634.78] Right
[3634.78 → 3635.64] Because the priest
[3635.64 → 3637.38] Needs to declare them
[3637.38 → 3637.88] Clean
[3637.88 → 3638.76] So that they don't
[3638.76 → 3639.72] Function again
[3639.72 → 3641.36] In normal society
[3641.36 → 3643.26] That's the word
[3643.26 → 3644.04] Catherine Bozo
[3644.04 → 3645.58] Now Catherine Bozo
[3645.58 → 3646.54] In English
[3646.54 → 3647.66] Is also
[3647.66 → 3648.52] Where we get
[3648.52 → 3649.08] The word
[3649.08 → 3650.18] Or the English word
[3650.18 → 3651.08] Catharsis
[3651.08 → 3652.76] Or cathartic
[3652.76 → 3654.90] So here's an interesting
[3654.90 → 3655.86] Language fact
[3655.86 → 3656.38] For you
[3656.38 → 3658.02] Catharsis
[3658.02 → 3660.02] Entered the English
[3660.02 → 3660.98] Lexicon
[3660.98 → 3662.66] As a medical term
[3662.66 → 3664.36] For purging the body
[3664.36 → 3666.18] For you young boys
[3666.18 → 3667.60] Especially the ballast
[3667.60 → 3670.24] As a way of releasing
[3670.24 → 3671.20] Unwanted interior
[3671.20 → 3673.86] Now today
[3673.86 → 3675.34] Catharsis means something
[3675.34 → 3676.02] A little different
[3676.02 → 3676.88] Right
[3676.88 → 3678.08] We use the word
[3678.08 → 3678.94] Cathartic
[3678.94 → 3679.60] When we're talking
[3679.60 → 3680.18] About releasing
[3680.18 → 3681.54] Tent of emotions
[3681.54 → 3683.22] Right
[3683.22 → 3683.82] To say something
[3683.82 → 3684.98] Is cathartic
[3684.98 → 3686.18] It means it's a release
[3686.18 → 3687.18] It's a letting go
[3687.18 → 3687.66] Of something
[3687.66 → 3688.24] That we've been
[3688.24 → 3689.20] Hanging on to
[3689.20 → 3690.76] Often in our subconscious
[3690.76 → 3692.00] Or in our emotional
[3692.00 → 3692.40] Cells
[3692.40 → 3695.70] Now of the ten men
[3695.70 → 3697.10] Who were cleansed
[3697.10 → 3697.54] Cathartic
[3697.54 → 3699.50] Nine of them
[3699.50 → 3700.78] Experienced that
[3700.78 → 3702.88] Only as healing
[3702.88 → 3704.56] And only as a return
[3704.56 → 3705.02] To health
[3705.02 → 3707.02] They experienced
[3707.02 → 3708.46] Physical healing
[3708.46 → 3709.94] What's pretty clear
[3709.94 → 3710.80] From the story
[3710.80 → 3712.38] Is that the ten men
[3712.38 → 3713.72] Experienced something
[3713.72 → 3715.02] More than physical
[3715.02 → 3715.68] Healing
[3715.68 → 3716.88] From this Jesus
[3716.88 → 3717.76] Who is God
[3717.76 → 3719.78] And yes
[3719.78 → 3720.94] Very clearly
[3720.94 → 3722.18] This man has
[3722.18 → 3722.92] An emotional
[3722.92 → 3723.88] Reaction
[3723.88 → 3724.82] He has an emotional
[3724.82 → 3725.54] Response
[3725.54 → 3726.14] To Jesus
[3726.14 → 3726.44] Right
[3726.44 → 3727.02] Praising
[3727.02 → 3727.94] And thanking
[3727.94 → 3729.00] He threw himself
[3729.00 → 3729.48] Down
[3729.48 → 3730.64] At the feet of Jesus
[3730.64 → 3731.30] That ain't just
[3731.30 → 3732.26] Any old reaction
[3732.26 → 3734.30] But
[3734.30 → 3735.86] And this is a big
[3735.86 → 3736.18] Odd
[3736.18 → 3736.48] Here
[3736.48 → 3739.46] Too many people
[3739.46 → 3740.50] Think
[3740.50 → 3741.82] Of Jesus
[3741.82 → 3743.24] And the gospel
[3743.24 → 3744.68] As providing
[3744.68 → 3745.62] A sort of
[3745.62 → 3746.62] Catharsis
[3746.62 → 3749.28] The gospel
[3749.28 → 3750.12] Isn't about
[3750.12 → 3750.66] Giving you
[3750.66 → 3751.58] Peace of mind
[3751.58 → 3752.28] Or relieving
[3752.28 → 3753.22] Your anxiety
[3753.22 → 3754.82] Now let me be
[3754.82 → 3755.36] Pretty clear
[3755.36 → 3755.60] Right
[3755.60 → 3756.48] Trusting God
[3756.48 → 3757.50] Might do that
[3757.50 → 3758.60] Right
[3758.60 → 3759.84] But your peace of mind
[3759.84 → 3760.60] Your emotional
[3760.60 → 3761.24] Catharsis
[3761.24 → 3762.26] Is not the point
[3762.26 → 3762.88] Of the gospel
[3762.88 → 3764.88] Jesus didn't come
[3764.88 → 3765.34] To give you
[3765.34 → 3766.10] Peace of mind
[3766.10 → 3766.78] He came
[3766.78 → 3767.48] To give you
[3767.48 → 3768.54] Peace with God
[3768.54 → 3772.24] Peace with God
[3772.24 → 3773.82] Only comes
[3773.82 → 3774.64] When you are
[3774.64 → 3775.92] Made righteous
[3775.92 → 3776.72] When you are
[3776.72 → 3777.64] Made pure
[3777.64 → 3779.22] From sin
[3779.22 → 3781.66] Nine men
[3781.66 → 3782.98] Were cleansed
[3782.98 → 3783.72] That day
[3783.72 → 3785.20] But I believe
[3785.20 → 3785.62] One
[3785.62 → 3787.16] Got more than that
[3787.16 → 3789.72] Titus 2
[3789.72 → 3790.52] Verse 14
[3790.52 → 3790.88] Says
[3790.88 → 3793.62] Our great God
[3793.62 → 3794.20] And Saviour
[3794.20 → 3795.16] Jesus Christ
[3795.16 → 3796.30] Gave himself
[3796.30 → 3796.98] For us
[3796.98 → 3798.08] To redeem us
[3798.08 → 3799.24] From all wickedness
[3799.24 → 3800.54] And to purify
[3800.54 → 3801.72] For himself
[3801.72 → 3802.40] The people
[3802.40 → 3803.50] That are his
[3803.50 → 3804.42] Very normal
[3804.42 → 3805.90] That word
[3805.90 → 3806.74] Purify
[3806.74 → 3807.92] Is
[3807.92 → 3808.72] Catholicism
[3808.72 → 3810.08] The same
[3810.08 → 3810.88] Word
[3810.88 → 3812.54] Shows up again
[3812.54 → 3813.30] In 1 John
[3813.30 → 3813.66] 1
[3813.66 → 3813.96] 7
[3813.96 → 3814.46] 9
[3814.46 → 3815.98] The blood
[3815.98 → 3816.62] Of Jesus
[3816.62 → 3817.40] His son
[3817.40 → 3818.94] Purifies us
[3818.94 → 3819.94] From all sin
[3819.94 → 3821.10] If we confess
[3821.10 → 3821.82] Our sins
[3821.82 → 3823.18] He is faithful
[3823.18 → 3823.76] And just
[3823.76 → 3824.60] And will forgive
[3824.60 → 3825.50] Us our sins
[3825.50 → 3827.30] And purify us
[3827.30 → 3828.28] From all
[3828.28 → 3829.46] Unrighteousness
[3829.46 → 3832.40] Too many times
[3832.40 → 3833.16] In the church
[3833.16 → 3833.64] Today
[3833.64 → 3834.20] We think
[3834.20 → 3834.72] That the main
[3834.72 → 3835.28] Point of the
[3835.28 → 3835.62] Gospel
[3835.62 → 3836.54] Is to feel
[3836.54 → 3837.02] Good
[3837.02 → 3837.92] Or secure
[3837.92 → 3838.76] Or happy
[3838.76 → 3839.52] Or comfortable
[3839.52 → 3840.52] In this
[3840.52 → 3841.24] Life
[3841.24 → 3844.52] But for the
[3844.52 → 3845.34] True Christian
[3845.34 → 3846.84] The gospel
[3846.84 → 3848.04] Is purity
[3848.04 → 3849.84] Before God
[3849.84 → 3850.68] The gospel
[3850.68 → 3851.64] Is peace
[3851.64 → 3853.10] With God
[3853.10 → 3855.14] If all
[3855.14 → 3855.64] You think
[3855.64 → 3855.90] About
[3855.90 → 3856.66] Christianity
[3856.66 → 3858.12] If all
[3858.12 → 3858.52] You think
[3858.52 → 3858.98] Christianity
[3858.98 → 3859.56] Is for
[3859.56 → 3860.40] Or about
[3860.40 → 3861.54] Is your
[3861.54 → 3862.44] Physical healing
[3862.44 → 3863.58] Or an emotional
[3863.58 → 3864.52] Catharsis
[3864.52 → 3865.28] You've missed
[3865.28 → 3865.76] The message
[3865.76 → 3866.46] Of Jesus
[3866.46 → 3868.80] Isaiah the prophet
[3868.80 → 3869.06] Says
[3869.06 → 3870.00] Though your sins
[3870.00 → 3871.12] Are like scarlet
[3871.12 → 3871.92] They shall be
[3871.92 → 3873.30] As white as snow
[3873.30 → 3874.38] Though they are
[3874.38 → 3875.86] As red as crimson
[3875.86 → 3876.66] They shall be
[3876.66 → 3877.92] Like wool
[3877.92 → 3880.32] There's so many
[3880.32 → 3881.52] People in the world
[3881.52 → 3882.28] Today
[3882.28 → 3883.22] Maybe even for
[3883.22 → 3883.68] Some of us
[3883.68 → 3884.38] Sitting here
[3884.38 → 3885.56] The functional
[3885.56 → 3886.28] Purpose
[3886.28 → 3887.42] Of religion
[3887.42 → 3888.80] That the reason
[3888.80 → 3889.84] Religion exists
[3889.84 → 3890.58] In the world
[3890.58 → 3891.86] Is to make
[3891.86 → 3892.96] Good people
[3892.96 → 3893.88] Or to make
[3893.88 → 3894.62] People a little
[3894.62 → 3895.16] Bit better
[3895.16 → 3897.28] And to soothe
[3897.28 → 3898.56] Our consciences
[3898.56 → 3899.94] When we feel
[3899.94 → 3900.34] Bad
[3900.34 → 3902.90] Gospel Christianity
[3902.90 → 3903.68] Is not something
[3903.68 → 3904.70] Different from that
[3904.70 → 3906.46] Now again
[3906.46 → 3907.58] Don't hear
[3907.58 → 3908.08] What I'm not
[3908.08 → 3908.46] Saying
[3908.46 → 3909.66] Right
[3909.66 → 3910.90] Gospel Christianity
[3910.90 → 3911.94] Produces
[3911.94 → 3913.58] Good out of us
[3913.58 → 3914.70] Gospel Christianity
[3914.70 → 3916.60] Soothes our consciences
[3916.60 → 3918.80] As we are reconciled to God
[3918.80 → 3920.16] But the purpose
[3920.16 → 3921.32] Of the gospel
[3921.32 → 3922.26] Is to do
[3922.26 → 3923.28] Precisely
[3923.28 → 3924.56] What I cannot
[3924.56 → 3926.66] But need to do
[3926.66 → 3927.98] The gospel says
[3927.98 → 3928.58] That Jesus
[3928.58 → 3929.44] Lived the life
[3929.44 → 3930.22] I should have lived
[3930.22 → 3931.32] And done the death
[3931.32 → 3932.32] That I deserve
[3932.32 → 3933.12] That Jesus
[3933.12 → 3934.06] Is the perfect
[3934.06 → 3935.00] Sacrifice
[3935.00 → 3936.34] Of atonement
[3936.34 → 3937.00] That is to say
[3937.00 → 3938.44] He was perfect
[3938.44 → 3939.40] In that he was
[3939.40 → 3941.44] Perfectly obedient
[3941.44 → 3942.62] And he was perfect
[3942.62 → 3944.44] In that only he
[3944.44 → 3945.74] As God
[3945.74 → 3947.54] Could save humanity
[3947.54 → 3949.02] By his death
[3949.02 → 3950.44] In our place
[3950.44 → 3951.00] That's what
[3951.00 → 3952.48] Atonement means
[3952.48 → 3953.62] The gospel is
[3953.62 → 3955.22] First and foremost
[3955.22 → 3957.32] The action of God
[3957.32 → 3958.06] In the world
[3958.06 → 3959.06] To restore
[3959.06 → 3960.48] People like you
[3960.48 → 3961.42] And me
[3961.42 → 3962.92] In relationship
[3962.92 → 3964.08] To him
[3964.08 → 3965.64] A relationship
[3965.64 → 3966.48] That was broken
[3966.48 → 3967.68] Because of sin
[3967.68 → 3968.64] And in a relationship
[3968.64 → 3969.86] That stays broken
[3969.86 → 3970.86] Because of our
[3970.86 → 3972.24] Unloving sin
[3972.24 → 3972.90] Right
[3972.90 → 3974.46] Over and over
[3974.46 → 3975.50] And over again
[3975.50 → 3976.44] The Bible makes it
[3976.44 → 3977.52] Abundantly clear
[3977.52 → 3979.20] How our sin need
[3979.20 → 3980.18] Is greater
[3980.18 → 3981.08] Than any of our
[3981.08 → 3981.88] Physical needs
[3981.88 → 3982.88] Any of our
[3982.88 → 3983.96] Emotional needs
[3983.96 → 3985.98] Especially
[3985.98 → 3987.76] In a culture
[3987.76 → 3989.52] That has adopted
[3989.52 → 3990.72] Their values
[3990.72 → 3991.46] Like ours
[3991.46 → 3992.36] That has adopted
[3992.36 → 3993.74] Christian values
[3993.74 → 3994.38] And virtues
[3994.38 → 3995.64] While disconnecting
[3995.64 → 3996.42] Them from a biblical
[3996.42 → 3996.90] Basis
[3996.90 → 3997.88] While removing them
[3997.88 → 3999.04] From the character
[3999.04 → 4000.24] And being of God
[4000.24 → 4000.74] Right
[4000.74 → 4002.72] We live in a time
[4002.72 → 4003.58] And place
[4003.58 → 4004.76] That assumes
[4004.76 → 4005.66] A relative
[4005.66 → 4007.26] Goodness of people
[4007.26 → 4009.76] And so minimizes
[4009.76 → 4011.28] The perversity
[4011.28 → 4012.38] Of sin
[4012.38 → 4013.68] And its effect
[4013.68 → 4014.74] In our life
[4014.74 → 4016.60] Simply put
[4016.60 → 4017.20] Right
[4017.20 → 4018.38] We don't believe
[4018.38 → 4019.04] That sin
[4019.04 → 4019.56] Or
[4019.56 → 4021.00] To put it more strongly
[4021.00 → 4021.90] We don't believe
[4021.90 → 4022.78] That our relationship
[4022.78 → 4023.60] To God
[4023.60 → 4024.20] Which is broken
[4024.20 → 4024.84] By sin
[4024.84 → 4026.94] Is our greatest need
[4026.94 → 4027.78] Anymore
[4027.78 → 4029.52] Instead
[4029.52 → 4031.00] We look for
[4031.00 → 4031.78] Physical healing
[4031.78 → 4033.16] We look for
[4033.16 → 4034.50] Therapeutic healing
[4034.50 → 4035.02] We look for
[4035.02 → 4035.84] Cathartic
[4035.84 → 4036.86] Release
[4036.86 → 4040.42] But the gospel
[4040.42 → 4041.98] And the true
[4041.98 → 4042.52] Christian
[4042.52 → 4043.66] Look even
[4043.66 → 4044.64] Even deeper
[4044.64 → 4046.18] Than those things
[4046.18 → 4048.56] Physical healing
[4048.56 → 4049.12] Is good
[4049.12 → 4050.86] Emotional healing
[4050.86 → 4051.52] Is good
[4051.52 → 4053.54] Reconciliation
[4053.54 → 4054.14] To God
[4054.14 → 4055.10] Is even
[4055.10 → 4055.88] Better
[4055.88 → 4058.94] At the end
[4058.94 → 4059.78] Of this exchange
[4059.78 → 4061.46] Jesus says
[4061.46 → 4062.34] To the man
[4062.34 → 4063.00] Rise
[4063.00 → 4063.62] And go
[4063.62 → 4064.90] For your faith
[4064.90 → 4066.06] Has made you well
[4066.06 → 4067.66] Now
[4067.66 → 4069.24] To be clear
[4069.24 → 4072.48] This can't mean
[4072.48 → 4074.04] That his faith
[4074.04 → 4075.18] Healed him
[4075.18 → 4076.70] Okay
[4076.70 → 4077.60] This can't mean
[4077.60 → 4078.32] That his faith
[4078.32 → 4079.28] Healed him
[4079.28 → 4080.26] One
[4080.26 → 4081.60] He was healed
[4081.60 → 4082.92] Before displaying
[4082.92 → 4083.98] Any acts of faith
[4083.98 → 4085.88] Two
[4085.88 → 4087.60] The other nine
[4087.60 → 4088.34] Were also
[4088.34 → 4089.14] Cleansed
[4089.14 → 4090.68] And they didn't
[4090.68 → 4091.56] Return to
[4091.56 → 4092.56] Praise and
[4092.56 → 4093.50] Thank Jesus
[4093.50 → 4094.92] And so
[4094.92 → 4096.08] Even if
[4096.08 → 4096.80] Like what some
[4096.80 → 4097.52] People say
[4097.52 → 4098.26] His
[4098.26 → 4099.64] Faith
[4099.64 → 4102.82] Has healed him
[4102.82 → 4103.40] Even if
[4103.40 → 4104.06] That is
[4104.06 → 4105.32] In response
[4105.32 → 4106.00] To an
[4106.00 → 4107.02] Anticipated
[4107.02 → 4107.88] Faithfulness
[4107.88 → 4108.74] That is known
[4108.74 → 4109.40] By God
[4109.40 → 4110.48] Before the
[4110.48 → 4111.08] Offering
[4111.08 → 4112.16] And the other
[4112.16 → 4112.58] Nine
[4112.58 → 4113.26] Who didn't
[4113.26 → 4113.94] Respond
[4113.94 → 4114.62] In faith
[4114.62 → 4115.22] Are still
[4115.22 → 4115.64] Healed
[4115.64 → 4115.98] And so
[4115.98 → 4116.18] Again
[4116.18 → 4116.84] That just proves
[4116.84 → 4117.46] That idea
[4117.46 → 4118.42] False
[4118.42 → 4119.64] Instead
[4119.64 → 4121.08] I think
[4121.08 → 4121.52] Jesus
[4121.52 → 4122.42] Is looking
[4122.42 → 4122.94] At the
[4122.94 → 4123.40] Bigger
[4123.40 → 4124.02] Picture
[4124.02 → 4124.68] He's looking
[4124.68 → 4125.62] Deeper
[4125.62 → 4126.22] And at a
[4126.22 → 4126.66] Fuller
[4126.66 → 4127.16] Gospel
[4127.16 → 4128.08] Than the
[4128.08 → 4128.54] Idea
[4128.54 → 4129.28] That his
[4129.28 → 4129.84] Faith
[4129.84 → 4130.44] Healed
[4130.44 → 4130.68] His
[4130.68 → 4131.06] Physical
[4131.06 → 4131.50] Needs
[4131.50 → 4133.10] In fact
[4133.10 → 4133.64] Again
[4133.64 → 4134.14] The word
[4134.14 → 4135.18] Spelled
[4135.18 → 4135.50] This out
[4135.50 → 4135.88] The word
[4135.88 → 4136.72] Translated
[4136.72 → 4137.60] May you
[4137.60 → 4138.02] Well
[4138.02 → 4139.98] In this
[4139.98 → 4141.14] Text
[4141.14 → 4142.06] Is a
[4142.06 → 4143.22] Particular
[4143.22 → 4143.82] Form
[4143.82 → 4144.32] Of the
[4144.32 → 4144.60] Greek
[4144.60 → 4144.90] Word
[4144.90 → 4145.62] Solo
[4145.62 → 4146.36] Which means
[4146.36 → 4146.96] To save
[4146.96 → 4148.00] The root
[4148.00 → 4148.92] Is used
[4148.92 → 4149.58] For instance
[4149.58 → 4150.14] In Acts
[4150.14 → 4150.64] 4
[4150.64 → 4151.76] Verse 12
[4151.76 → 4152.50] By Peter
[4152.50 → 4152.98] When he
[4152.98 → 4153.52] Preaches
[4153.52 → 4154.92] Salvation
[4154.92 → 4155.62] Is found
[4155.62 → 4156.32] In no one
[4156.32 → 4156.68] Else
[4156.68 → 4157.34] For there's
[4157.34 → 4157.72] No other
[4157.72 → 4158.04] Name
[4158.04 → 4158.60] Under heaven
[4158.60 → 4159.14] Given to
[4159.14 → 4159.52] Mankind
[4159.52 → 4160.48] By which
[4160.48 → 4161.34] We must
[4161.34 → 4161.94] Be
[4161.94 → 4164.02] Saved
[4164.02 → 4165.06] The translator
[4165.06 → 4165.40] Says
[4165.40 → 4166.30] The NIP
[4166.30 → 4167.72] Make this
[4167.72 → 4168.16] Clear
[4168.16 → 4168.94] For instance
[4168.94 → 4169.44] In Luke
[4169.44 → 4170.16] 7
[4170.16 → 4171.10] Verse 50
[4171.10 → 4172.28] Where Jesus
[4172.28 → 4172.94] Says
[4172.94 → 4173.68] To the woman
[4173.68 → 4174.96] Who was
[4174.96 → 4175.60] Healed
[4175.60 → 4176.22] Just by
[4176.22 → 4176.96] Reaching out
[4176.96 → 4177.44] And touching
[4177.44 → 4178.12] His road
[4178.12 → 4179.16] He says
[4179.16 → 4179.98] Your faith
[4179.98 → 4181.24] Has saved
[4181.24 → 4181.62] You
[4181.62 → 4184.06] Luke
[4184.06 → 4184.72] 50
[4184.72 → 4185.90] Or 7
[4185.90 → 4186.94] Verse 50
[4186.94 → 4187.66] And Luke
[4187.66 → 4188.26] 17
[4188.26 → 4188.82] 19
[4188.82 → 4190.16] Are exactly
[4190.16 → 4190.70] The same
[4190.70 → 4191.40] Sentence in
[4191.40 → 4191.66] Greek
[4191.66 → 4193.10] Boston
[4193.10 → 4195.90] Your faith has saved you.
[4196.00 → 4203.84] And I think the point that Jesus is showing is just how big the gospel is for this man.
[4204.44 → 4204.56] Right?
[4204.66 → 4207.60] Ten were healed, but that's not the gospel.
[4208.80 → 4213.30] One had an emotional response, but catharsis isn't the gospel either.
[4213.92 → 4221.18] Instead, faith and salvation go hand in love that the man returns to worship and give thanks
[4221.18 → 4224.56] as an invitation of being saved.
[4225.82 → 4228.94] Darrell Offer says, so succinctly, he says,
[4229.28 → 4235.70] the deliverance Jesus affirms here is greater than the healing the man has experienced.
[4237.60 → 4243.42] The healing points to a greater healing for this man.
[4244.14 → 4247.02] A purifying from all unrighteousness.
[4247.02 → 4254.58] Jesus is purifying for himself a people who belong to him as his own.
[4255.96 → 4256.96] Ten were healed.
[4258.12 → 4259.88] One was purified.
[4260.16 → 4261.10] Ten were healed.
[4261.60 → 4265.00] One praised God and thanked Jesus.
[4266.34 → 4274.28] Thanksgiving isn't distinctly Christian, but giving thanks to God in worship is distinctive
[4274.28 → 4276.92] of the true Christian.
[4279.80 → 4287.26] And you know, that idea that giving thanks to God in worship is a distinctive of the true
[4287.26 → 4287.64] Christian.
[4287.78 → 4290.30] That idea got me wondering.
[4292.02 → 4299.24] If Thanksgiving is a distinctive of the Christian, is that what Christians in the world today are
[4299.24 → 4299.88] known for?
[4299.88 → 4303.78] Is that how you are known at work?
[4305.26 → 4309.76] And on your soccer team, does your coach think of you as the thankful one?
[4311.30 → 4314.76] How are Christians known in the world today?
[4316.32 → 4322.66] You know, in our increasingly post-Christian age, we've all heard, I've even talked about,
[4322.66 → 4327.44] how Christians are identified and treated with suspicion.
[4328.52 → 4328.68] Right?
[4328.74 → 4332.38] And how sometimes people think that we are, what's wrong with the world?
[4333.38 → 4338.56] A couple of weeks ago, we had a leadership training event that I got to speak on the main stage
[4338.56 → 4338.88] for.
[4339.50 → 4342.68] We talked about just this reality that you were finding yourself in.
[4342.68 → 4347.24] And a gentleman who goes to one of the Christian Reformed churches in the area, who works for
[4347.24 → 4351.04] the federal government, came up to me afterwards and said, you are bang on.
[4351.50 → 4358.28] There is a place for everyone in this society of ours except for the believing Christian.
[4361.58 → 4361.82] Right?
[4361.82 → 4367.40] Sometimes people think that we, as Christians, are what's wrong with the world.
[4367.86 → 4367.98] Right?
[4368.28 → 4373.14] Christians, especially if you are a conservative Christian, are often told that we're on the
[4373.14 → 4374.06] wrong side of history.
[4375.60 → 4375.72] Right?
[4375.72 → 4382.26] And let's be abundantly clear and transparent because things like abuse scandals or sexual
[4382.26 → 4383.38] abuse cover-up.
[4383.70 → 4383.86] Right?
[4384.00 → 4385.44] It's prevalent in the church.
[4385.70 → 4390.28] There's a history of racism in things like residential schools or in child slavery or in
[4390.28 → 4390.70] segregation.
[4391.40 → 4391.56] Right?
[4391.64 → 4394.28] All of these things have been done by Christians.
[4394.28 → 4399.84] And some of them in our history even have Christians at the helm setting the lead for them,
[4399.90 → 4402.18] setting the course of history in a particular era.
[4402.18 → 4408.04] And let me be abundantly clear, this isn't just the past, but continues in the present.
[4410.44 → 4413.32] But it's also not just Christians.
[4414.48 → 4419.60] Now I will say that it's more grievous when it isn't Christian because we ought to know better
[4419.60 → 4423.04] and by the Holy Spirit we can actually do better.
[4424.26 → 4425.94] And so we confess our sins.
[4429.66 → 4432.08] But this is where my thinking is being born.
[4432.18 → 4433.36] Got a little bit more interesting.
[4434.10 → 4440.10] Because if that's the sort of 30,000 foot view of Christians in our post-Christian age,
[4440.56 → 4443.98] what is the ground level view here in Murray?
[4444.98 → 4447.90] What's the ground level view here in Langley?
[4448.66 → 4448.88] Right?
[4448.94 → 4451.18] That's the thing that interested me this week.
[4451.18 → 4457.72] And so I put together a little survey of five questions.
[4458.64 → 4463.10] And I went up to the square on top of the hill on Thursday afternoon.
[4463.68 → 4468.98] And I walked around, and I asked people what they thought of Christians in the world today.
[4468.98 → 4473.12] So I asked them these five questions.
[4473.36 → 4475.30] When you hear the word Christian, what do you think?
[4476.90 → 4480.04] When you think the history of Christianity in Canada, what comes to mind?
[4481.62 → 4482.00] Right?
[4482.08 → 4483.80] When you hear that in Jesus, what do you think?
[4484.82 → 4487.00] When you hear the word church, what comes to mind?
[4487.00 → 4493.30] And then the last question I asked, are Christians a positive force for good in the world?
[4494.48 → 4500.30] And I've got to tell you, I went up there expecting to hear things like bigotry,
[4501.18 → 4507.14] expecting to hear things like racist, expecting to hear things like backwards or traditional
[4507.14 → 4510.20] or slow, whatever the case may be.
[4510.20 → 4515.38] I went up there expecting to not get in a fight because I told myself I would take a posture
[4515.38 → 4520.00] of just asking questions and walking away, but to leave feeling kind of bad afterwards.
[4521.58 → 4522.76] Can I tell you that didn't happen?
[4525.52 → 4525.74] Right?
[4525.78 → 4531.40] So for instance, when I asked, what do you hear when you hear the word Christian,
[4531.92 → 4532.64] what do you think?
[4534.02 → 4536.60] People said things like, I don't know, church?
[4537.74 → 4538.18] God?
[4539.72 → 4540.16] Hope?
[4540.86 → 4541.30] Jesus?
[4542.50 → 4545.08] One person said, all religions are the same.
[4545.26 → 4545.44] Can you?
[4547.26 → 4548.14] Think of heaven?
[4548.98 → 4550.62] One person even said, my religion?
[4554.04 → 4555.32] That was an awful one.
[4557.50 → 4561.56] When I asked, what do you think about the history of Christianity in Canada
[4561.56 → 4562.90] and what comes to mind?
[4563.64 → 4565.08] Or what do you think about the history of Christianity?
[4565.30 → 4567.70] When do you think about the history of Christianity and what comes to mind?
[4567.70 → 4571.48] Again, I was expecting to hear some pretty awful things.
[4572.58 → 4573.18] Right?
[4573.18 → 4575.98] Maybe because I lived in the midst of hearing those things.
[4575.98 → 4577.76] But here's what people said.
[4577.82 → 4579.74] They said, nothing.
[4583.74 → 4583.98] Religion?
[4584.38 → 4585.26] Another religion?
[4585.50 → 4585.74] Sorry.
[4586.84 → 4588.10] One of them said Christmas.
[4588.10 → 4595.90] Now, one person did say, priests, and they were talking about the sex abuse and scandal.
[4597.08 → 4600.70] But one person also said explicitly, not negative things.
[4600.70 → 4603.20] I try not to believe the negative things.
[4605.88 → 4609.52] I asked, when you hear the name of Jesus, what do you think?
[4610.80 → 4612.82] One person said, why?
[4612.82 → 4621.00] Another person said, and this is more characteristic, honestly, not much.
[4623.78 → 4626.46] So when you hear the word church, what comes to mind?
[4627.68 → 4629.04] One person said, glory?
[4630.82 → 4631.48] I said, yeah.
[4632.66 → 4633.76] Unless you come to our church.
[4633.76 → 4639.76] One person said, I don't know how to explain it.
[4641.82 → 4648.06] One man I talked to said, the first word that comes to mind when I hear the word church is institutional zoning.
[4649.94 → 4651.04] So are you a civil engineer?
[4651.14 → 4651.54] He was gay.
[4651.54 → 4660.20] What I asked the last question, are Christians a positive force in the world?
[4662.50 → 4666.30] The answers were split right down the middle.
[4668.68 → 4680.02] Between yes, and sometimes, maybe, overall yes, but also not so good.
[4681.54 → 4683.10] There was no noes.
[4684.34 → 4685.74] There was no absence and no's.
[4689.10 → 4693.72] Now, the reason I think this is important, a number of things that I think are important,
[4693.88 → 4702.42] but one of them is, I went through the expectation of getting into a fight or appearing on the negative things.
[4702.72 → 4705.64] And I'm not denying that there are people in the world who treat those things.
[4706.06 → 4710.84] I'm not denying that in some places in the world, that's probably a majority opinion.
[4711.54 → 4717.04] But for all you all who are scared to talk to your neighbours and unbelieving friends about Christianity,
[4717.18 → 4719.26] because that's what you hear, hear this.
[4721.04 → 4721.70] Hear this.
[4724.68 → 4729.34] Second, what I want us to hear out of this,
[4729.34 → 4734.72] is actually how boring these answers are.
[4737.72 → 4739.96] And I hope that's a conviction to you.
[4741.56 → 4747.56] Because if being thankful is a distinctive of a true Christian,
[4747.56 → 4753.52] people are politely apathetic towards us,
[4755.20 → 4760.80] is there something missing from our Thanksgiving in the world and how he expresses it?
[4761.84 → 4763.80] If this is what people think of us,
[4763.86 → 4765.64] because Kevin and I were reflecting on this,
[4765.70 → 4766.68] and he came up with the phrase,
[4766.78 → 4767.54] polite apathy.
[4768.38 → 4770.04] If this is how people think of us,
[4770.04 → 4773.14] what can we do differently?
[4776.58 → 4778.24] In the context of our story,
[4779.26 → 4783.18] nine people received the cleansing,
[4783.82 → 4785.08] and they went on their way.
[4785.88 → 4789.02] Nine people received the healing from Jesus,
[4789.18 → 4789.80] and they're like, great.
[4791.52 → 4792.82] Man, move on.
[4794.06 → 4796.30] Nine people received that healing from Jesus,
[4796.42 → 4797.98] and they're like, sure, thanks.
[4797.98 → 4799.50] Now, whatever.
[4803.34 → 4807.32] I suggest that the vast majority of people in our circles
[4807.32 → 4811.96] are kind of like Jesus overall,
[4812.20 → 4813.46] but man.
[4814.20 → 4817.50] But not much, honestly, kind of people.
[4819.52 → 4824.00] Nine people have this polite attitude.
[4824.00 → 4827.16] I said a couple of weeks ago,
[4827.74 → 4830.14] in one of our kick-off sermons,
[4830.66 → 4834.34] a quote from the epistle to Dionysus,
[4835.14 → 4837.36] from the second century AD,
[4837.90 → 4839.44] where he says,
[4840.00 → 4842.24] as the soul is to the body,
[4842.90 → 4845.24] Christians are to the city.
[4845.24 → 4851.40] If this is what people in our city think of Christians,
[4852.20 → 4854.48] what's the state of our soul
[4854.48 → 4855.46] being expressed?
[4858.96 → 4861.60] In our Thanksgiving liturgy earlier in the service,
[4862.28 → 4866.72] we call this a war for gratitude.
[4866.72 → 4872.76] Thanksgiving is a battle for the soul of the church.
[4874.08 → 4878.84] We have a chance to express our deep gratitude to God,
[4878.92 → 4883.32] and to be known as the people of Thanksgiving.
[4883.32 → 4888.10] It's not as scary as you might think it is,
[4889.06 → 4892.36] but it is as awesome as you're dreaming about it.
[4893.40 → 4895.34] That is the gospel.
[4896.30 → 4899.04] And that is why we give thanks.
[4899.62 → 4902.08] When we come to this table in just a moment,
[4902.24 → 4906.72] we are here at the Thanksgiving feast of the King,
[4906.72 → 4911.24] who meets us at this moment and at this place,
[4911.24 → 4915.48] so that our Thanksgiving might be experienced
[4915.48 → 4918.60] in something that we can taste and see.
[4919.00 → 4923.24] We taste and see that the Lord is good.
[4923.40 → 4928.94] We come to this table because He first came to us.
[4929.68 → 4931.70] And so as you come to this table today,
[4931.84 → 4935.06] come with hearts full of Thanksgiving
[4935.06 → 4937.68] for what He has done and in both.
[4939.12 → 4941.04] And be the soul of the city,
[4941.78 → 4944.60] giving thanks to God for who He is.
[4945.18 → 4945.44] Amen?
[4946.34 → 4947.40] Let's pray together.
[4952.18 → 4956.70] Lord our God, we thank You for leading us here.
[4957.94 → 4960.00] We thank You for who You are
[4960.00 → 4962.34] and for what You've done in Jesus Christ.
[4962.34 → 4965.24] We thank You for the countless blessings
[4965.24 → 4968.32] that You have bestowed on us.
[4968.50 → 4971.48] One of them living here in Durbanville,
[4971.60 → 4975.36] in Langley, in this region together.
[4977.40 → 4979.86] We thank You for this church family
[4979.86 → 4982.24] that now goes with You
[4982.24 → 4985.56] to proclaim Your kingdom come and Your kingdom come.
[4985.56 → 4991.56] May we be a people distinctly Christian
[4991.56 → 4994.18] in our Thanksgiving.
[4996.32 → 4999.40] May we overcome a life fantasy
[4999.40 → 5004.60] with our joy and worship of You.
[5005.44 → 5007.94] In Your name we pray, Lord Jesus.
[5008.78 → 5009.22] Amen.
[5009.22 → 5009.30] Amen.
[5009.30 → 5010.64] Amen.
[5010.64 → 5010.66] Amen.
[5010.66 → 5012.52] Amen.
[5012.52 → 5012.58] Amen.
[5012.58 → 5012.60] Amen.
[5012.60 → 5012.66] Amen.
[5012.66 → 5012.70] Amen.
[5015.56 → 5018.12] Amen.
[5021.08 → 5022.60] We come to the table.
[5022.92 → 5028.28] We will, of course, move through a liturgy for us
[5028.28 → 5030.78] and invite you to speak the words
[5030.78 → 5033.64] that are given to you on the screen behind.
[5033.78 → 5035.78] As we come to the table,
[5035.94 → 5038.48] we come here to meet Jesus
[5038.48 → 5040.30] and be met by Him.
[5040.38 → 5043.30] We come here as family together,
[5043.30 → 5047.14] brothers and sisters sharing in this table
[5047.14 → 5051.46] so that our faith might be nourished, and we might be sent
[5051.46 → 5055.50] out in faith together. We come to this table
[5055.50 → 5059.32] and we pray, and we say together, lift
[5059.32 → 5063.06] up your hearts. We lift to the Lord.
[5063.58 → 5067.24] Let us give thanks to the Lord our God. It is right
[5067.24 → 5069.78] for us to give thanks. Let's pray.
[5069.78 → 5073.78] With joy we praise
[5073.78 → 5076.78] and thank you, gracious God.
[5077.66 → 5081.82] For you have created heaven and earth and have made us in your image
[5081.82 → 5085.96] and you have kept covenant with us even when we fell into sin.
[5087.12 → 5089.66] We give you thanks and perhaps
[5089.66 → 5093.82] today especially but every day we give you thanks for Jesus
[5093.82 → 5097.50] Christ who by his life, death and resurrection opened
[5097.50 → 5100.44] to us the way of everlasting life.
[5101.44 → 5101.66] Amen.
[5101.66 → 5109.82] Jesus, before he suffered, gave us this memorial of his sacrifice
[5109.82 → 5112.44] until he comes again.
[5113.28 → 5117.64] The Lord Jesus, on the night that he was betrayed, took bread
[5117.64 → 5121.58] and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said,
[5121.94 → 5124.86] this is my body which is for you.
[5125.36 → 5127.98] Do this in remembrance of me.
[5127.98 → 5132.16] And in the same way, he took the cup
[5132.16 → 5136.26] after supper, saying, this cup is the new covenant
[5136.26 → 5137.92] in my heart.
[5138.66 → 5140.76] Do this whenever you drink
[5140.76 → 5143.04] in remembrance of me.
[5144.12 → 5145.94] For whenever you eat this bread
[5145.94 → 5147.64] and drink this cup,
[5147.78 → 5149.50] you proclaim the Lord's death
[5149.50 → 5152.42] until he comes again.
[5152.42 → 5157.64] This, then, is the mystery of our faith.
[5159.20 → 5161.80] Your death, O Christ, be your lame.
[5162.42 → 5165.06] Your resurrection, be a turn of joy.
[5165.80 → 5167.96] You're coming, be a way of hope.
[5168.70 → 5170.90] Glory be to you, Lord Jesus.
[5172.48 → 5177.58] Church, the Lord has prepared his table for all who love him
[5177.58 → 5180.42] and who trust in him alone for their salvation.
[5180.70 → 5184.36] And so, come to this Thanksgiving table.
[5184.56 → 5186.06] You who have much faith
[5186.06 → 5189.02] and you who would like to have more.
[5189.36 → 5191.44] Come to this Thanksgiving table.
[5191.60 → 5193.90] You who have been to the sacrament often
[5193.90 → 5197.14] and you who have not been in a long time.
[5197.50 → 5199.16] Come to this Thanksgiving table.
[5199.50 → 5201.62] You who have tried to follow Jesus
[5201.62 → 5203.58] and you who have failed.
[5203.76 → 5204.96] Come to this table
[5204.96 → 5208.26] because Jesus Christ is raised
[5208.26 → 5211.12] and it is him we praise.
[5211.82 → 5212.24] Come.
[5212.52 → 5214.18] If you are here with us
[5214.18 → 5216.08] or if you are at home and online,
[5216.52 → 5216.82] come.
[5217.00 → 5220.60] It is Christ himself who leads us here.
[5221.34 → 5222.40] The gifts of God
[5222.40 → 5224.58] for the people of God.
[5225.86 → 5227.68] As we come to this table here
[5227.68 → 5229.22] at Emmanuel Church,
[5229.22 → 5232.80] we do so gathering around in circles.
[5233.16 → 5234.76] And so, there are elders
[5234.76 → 5236.02] who will act as ushers.
[5236.18 → 5238.00] They will indicate when your row
[5238.00 → 5239.42] is to come forward
[5239.42 → 5241.30] and that you gather in a circle.
[5242.00 → 5244.50] We will pass the bread around
[5244.50 → 5246.42] and the juice around.
[5246.64 → 5248.00] And as you pass the bread,
[5248.14 → 5250.42] we encourage you to say to the person,
[5250.96 → 5252.86] the body of Christ given for you.
[5252.86 → 5254.46] And as you pass the juice,
[5254.58 → 5258.00] you say the blood of Christ shed for you.
[5259.22 → 5260.92] As we participate together,
[5261.06 → 5262.84] I invite the first group
[5262.84 → 5265.40] to be the worship volunteers
[5265.40 → 5267.46] and those who are ushering
[5267.46 → 5268.24] and coming forward
[5268.24 → 5269.82] so that they can be served
[5269.82 → 5271.44] and then they will play some music
[5271.44 → 5273.16] and sing along to
[5273.16 → 5274.66] as you wait for your turn
[5274.66 → 5275.50] to come to the front.
[5275.50 → 5277.02] If you are here
[5277.02 → 5278.74] and you would like to be prayed over
[5278.74 → 5279.66] or prayed with,
[5280.16 → 5281.76] either before coming to the table
[5281.76 → 5283.60] or in the space of coming to the table,
[5283.74 → 5284.90] there are people at the back
[5284.90 → 5286.88] who have name tags on,
[5287.06 → 5288.48] yellow squares on them.
[5288.76 → 5289.70] They'd love to meet you
[5289.70 → 5291.72] and pray with you as we go through.
[5291.96 → 5293.50] I invite the worship leaders
[5293.50 → 5294.56] and volunteers out there
[5294.56 → 5295.42] to run this time.
[5295.42 → 5325.40] Thank you.
[5325.42 → 5355.40] Thank you.
[5355.42 → 5361.38] thanks,
[5361.38 → 5367.56] eat and remember
[5367.56 → 5383.72] I need to add a question
