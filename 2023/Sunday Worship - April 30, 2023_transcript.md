[0.00 --> 29.98]  Thank you.
[30.00 --> 59.98]  Thank you.
[60.00 --> 89.98]  Thank you.
[90.00 --> 119.98]  Thank you.
[120.00 --> 149.98]  Thank you.
[150.00 --> 179.98]  Thank you.
[180.00 --> 209.98]  Thank you.
[210.00 --> 239.98]  Thank you.
[240.00 --> 269.98]  Thank you.
[270.00 --> 299.98]  Thank you.
[300.00 --> 329.98]  Thank you.
[330.00 --> 359.98]  Thank you.
[360.00 --> 389.98]  Thank you.
[390.00 --> 419.98]  Thank you.
[420.00 --> 449.98]  Thank you.
[450.00 --> 479.98]  Thank you.
[480.00 --> 509.98]  Thank you.
[510.00 --> 539.98]  Thank you.
[540.00 --> 569.98]  Thank you.
[570.00 --> 599.98]  Thank you.
[600.00 --> 629.98]  Thank you.
[630.00 --> 659.98]  Thank you.
[660.00 --> 689.98]  Thank you.
[690.82 --> 719.98]  First, a few health concerns that have just come up.
[719.98 --> 749.98]  Thank you.
[749.98 --> 779.98]  Thank you.
[779.98 --> 809.96]  It's really quiet.
[809.96 --> 816.18]  that's a bit of a challenge so I'm going to be speaking to that in my prayer. Let's go to the
[816.18 --> 821.94]  Lord in prayer. Heavenly Father we come before you today on this beautiful weekend. After a dark and
[821.94 --> 826.96]  wet spring we're grateful for the beautiful warm sunshine we are getting. We're reminded by your
[826.96 --> 832.48]  faithfulness in the growing of the grass, the buds on the trees, and the flowers that feel safe to
[832.48 --> 837.96]  come out and share their beauty. Lord we are thankful for when spring gives us the thoughts
[837.96 --> 843.38]  and feelings of new beginnings or a fresh start. We are thankful for the energy that spring gives us
[843.38 --> 847.80]  as we tackle projects around the house and the enjoyment of getting outside and enjoying nature.
[848.84 --> 853.74]  For many of us spring is a great time of the year and we look forward to its newness but for many
[853.74 --> 859.18]  this season is just like any other and brings it with it loneliness, health issues, and life challenges.
[860.26 --> 864.78]  We think of those Lord who are caring for aging parents and working through the challenges that
[864.78 --> 870.08]  go along with that. Give wisdom and patience to those who are involved with this right now.
[870.82 --> 875.22]  For those who mourn the loss of a loved one this time of the year doesn't give them a break from that.
[875.64 --> 882.18]  The hole that is left by the loss of a loved one is forever part of their lives. As difficult as this
[882.18 --> 886.76]  may be we ask Lord that you help those in this situation to find their new normal.
[886.76 --> 895.36]  Spring doesn't give those a break who are suffering from mental illness or those in our life that are suffering from mental illness.
[896.32 --> 901.40]  Help us as friends or family members of those suffering to walk beside and support our loved ones.
[902.28 --> 908.80]  It is very difficult to know what to do at times but give us the courage to be ready and willing to be leaned on when necessary.
[910.54 --> 913.54]  Lord we think of those who are going through some physical health issues.
[913.54 --> 918.90]  I mentioned many already this morning. We think of Fred Kuntz's mom who broke her hip recently.
[919.76 --> 926.22]  A lot of these broken bones and ailments like this can be a long road to recovery and a hard on the
[926.22 --> 930.00]  psychological mental side of things for recovery to happen.
[931.16 --> 936.46]  Lord we continue to pray for Sai Visser as he goes through chemotherapy for the cancer he is fighting.
[937.16 --> 940.54]  Lord we pray for healing and strength for Sai and Greta at this time.
[940.54 --> 946.76]  As well as John Koenig a former member of this church we pray for him too and his cancer fight.
[950.50 --> 955.06]  Lord we want to pray for our young people as many are coming home from university or college.
[956.00 --> 963.44]  Many are graduating from university or college and still many are finishing high school and are ready to embark on post high school journey.
[963.44 --> 965.72]  We pray for these young people.
[966.26 --> 970.28]  We know we pray for these young people and their parents.
[970.98 --> 975.30]  There's a lot of anxiety about all the decisions that need to be made as adulthood approaches.
[975.82 --> 981.46]  We pray for parents that are still relied upon for wisdom and patience as adulthood approaches.
[981.60 --> 983.62]  Whether it be to go to school or not.
[983.98 --> 988.00]  What program to take or what to do when I graduate or who to choose as a partner.
[988.00 --> 990.24]  These are big decisions.
[990.86 --> 994.04]  Lord we ask for your wisdom for parents and the youth.
[994.70 --> 999.86]  We are thankful that you are in control and we can trust that as your children we are in good hands.
[1000.18 --> 1000.86]  Your hands.
[1002.16 --> 1003.94]  Thank you Lord for this church Emmanuel.
[1005.44 --> 1008.50]  We are thankful for our hard working staff and all the work they do.
[1008.92 --> 1013.64]  We also thank you Lord for all the many volunteers that help this church function in the matter it does.
[1013.64 --> 1020.66]  From council members to ushers to those working with all ages of youth, worship teams and the visual arts.
[1021.08 --> 1023.92]  We are grateful for the many talents that are here at this church.
[1025.36 --> 1030.28]  As I wrap this prayer up Lord I was reminded recently of the Psalm 23.
[1030.28 --> 1035.36]  That we often learn as a child and put into our memory that offers comfort for all.
[1036.50 --> 1037.60]  The Lord is my shepherd.
[1037.96 --> 1038.80]  I lack nothing.
[1039.72 --> 1041.70]  He makes me lie down in green pastures.
[1041.70 --> 1044.22]  He leads me beside quiet waters.
[1044.34 --> 1045.64]  He refreshes my soul.
[1045.94 --> 1048.98]  He guides me along the right paths for his name's sake.
[1049.94 --> 1052.76]  Even though I walk through the darkest valley I fear no evil.
[1053.76 --> 1054.78]  For you are with me.
[1054.94 --> 1056.98]  Your rod and your staff they comfort me.
[1057.84 --> 1060.68]  You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.
[1061.72 --> 1063.02]  You anoint my head with oil.
[1063.18 --> 1063.70]  My cup overflows.
[1065.54 --> 1068.82]  Surely goodness and mercy and love will follow me all the days of my life.
[1068.82 --> 1071.26]  And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[1073.48 --> 1077.18]  Lord as your children replay that we will feel your presence this week.
[1077.86 --> 1083.32]  Give us the courage and wisdom and time to show others in our daily lives that you are the light in our life.
[1084.42 --> 1087.40]  Please be with Josh this morning as he brings the word to us.
[1088.00 --> 1090.00]  And give him strength and courage to do so.
[1090.20 --> 1091.88]  We ask all this in your name.
[1092.18 --> 1092.40]  Amen.
[1092.40 --> 1092.50]  Amen.
[1092.50 --> 1092.54]  Amen.
[1092.54 --> 1092.56]  Amen.
[1092.56 --> 1092.58]  Amen.
[1098.82 --> 1099.82]  Amen.
[1124.86 --> 1125.56]  We're on?
[1125.88 --> 1126.16]  Okay.
[1126.60 --> 1126.90]  Cool.
[1126.90 --> 1129.56]  I don't know what I would do if this mic stopped working.
[1129.96 --> 1131.22]  I'm not as skilled as Chris is.
[1134.26 --> 1134.70]  Okay.
[1136.62 --> 1137.68]  Good morning, everyone.
[1138.38 --> 1140.52]  Today we are looking at Jonah chapter 2.
[1141.10 --> 1146.16]  If you have your Bibles, whether physical or on your phone, follow along.
[1146.94 --> 1148.70]  It will also be on the screen if you don't have one.
[1151.10 --> 1152.02]  Jonah chapter 2.
[1152.02 --> 1157.14]  From inside the fish, Jonah prayed to the Lord his God.
[1158.08 --> 1158.66]  He said,
[1158.66 --> 1162.14]  In my distress, I called to the Lord, and he answered me.
[1162.84 --> 1167.76]  From deep in the realm of the dead, I called for help, and you listened to my cry.
[1168.62 --> 1174.08]  You hurled me into the depths, into the very heart of the seas, and the currents swirled about me.
[1174.44 --> 1177.10]  All your waves and breakers swept over me.
[1177.66 --> 1183.20]  I said, I have been banished from your sight, yet I will look again towards your holy temple.
[1183.20 --> 1186.06]  The engulfing waters threatened me.
[1186.38 --> 1187.48]  The deep surrounded me.
[1187.74 --> 1189.40]  Seaweed was wrapped around my head.
[1190.18 --> 1192.24]  To the roots of the mountains, I sank down.
[1192.66 --> 1195.16]  The earth beneath barred me in forever.
[1196.30 --> 1199.42]  But you, Lord my God, brought my life up from the pit.
[1200.08 --> 1206.58]  When my life was ebbing away, I remembered you, Lord, and my prayer rose to you, to your holy temple.
[1206.58 --> 1210.66]  Those who cling to worthless idols turn away from God's love for them.
[1211.22 --> 1215.08]  But I, with shouts of grateful praise, will sacrifice to you.
[1216.10 --> 1220.58]  What I have vowed, I will make good, and I will say, salvation comes from the Lord.
[1221.58 --> 1225.00]  And the Lord commanded the fish, and had vomited Jonah onto dry land.
[1227.16 --> 1228.36]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1228.36 --> 1229.36]  Okay.
[1234.88 --> 1241.98]  So, if you've been following along on your phones or in your physical Bible, then you probably noticed that chapter 2 looks different than the rest of the book.
[1243.18 --> 1245.80]  Or at least it sounds different when you hear it.
[1246.66 --> 1250.40]  That's because, as Chris mentioned on Sunday, it's a poem, last Sunday.
[1251.28 --> 1253.22]  Specifically, it's a Thanksgiving psalm.
[1253.78 --> 1257.74]  But before we get into the poem and dissect it, we have to understand the setting.
[1258.36 --> 1261.20]  When you read the poem as it is, it sounds great.
[1261.66 --> 1269.18]  But after you understand it in its context, your perspective on what Jonah is saying about himself and about God is quite interesting.
[1270.04 --> 1271.44]  The poem is not just a poem.
[1271.94 --> 1275.54]  It's an insight into what Jonah is thinking and to what he's like as a person.
[1276.68 --> 1282.92]  The poem serves to tell you why Jonah has behaved the way he has and why he will behave the way he does the rest of the book.
[1284.72 --> 1286.86]  Jonah, as we learn in chapter 1, is a hypocrite.
[1286.86 --> 1294.10]  And Jonah chapter 2 relies on the context of Jonah 1, so we're going to have to quickly review what we learned last Sunday.
[1295.10 --> 1295.80]  This is it.
[1296.66 --> 1302.00]  Jonah receives a message from God to go to the Ninevites and to speak against their evil.
[1302.00 --> 1314.16]  He charters a boat to the city of Tarshish, which at the time was believed to be southern Spain at the gates of Gibraltar, in the opposite direction of Nineveh.
[1315.42 --> 1317.80]  God then throws a storm at Jonah's boat.
[1319.10 --> 1325.80]  The sailors on the boat pray to their gods for help because they're frightened at the power of the storm, but their attempts failed.
[1325.80 --> 1331.78]  They find Jonah sleeping on the boat, and they get angry at him, and they bring him out to pray to his god as well.
[1332.76 --> 1337.54]  The men cast lots to see whose sin is a result and caused the storm.
[1338.08 --> 1340.48]  The lot falls on Jonah, and Jonah says,
[1340.62 --> 1345.70]  I am a Hebrew, and I fear the Lord, the God of heaven and earth, who made the sea and the land.
[1346.22 --> 1347.82]  The men are outraged at this.
[1348.42 --> 1351.22]  Jonah tells them to throw him overboard, and the storm will stop.
[1351.22 --> 1357.10]  But the men don't throw him overboard because they don't want to kill a prophet of God initially, so they try to row back.
[1358.20 --> 1360.26]  Then, storm gets worse.
[1360.76 --> 1364.00]  They pray to the Lord that he doesn't punish them for killing his prophet.
[1364.44 --> 1369.46]  They throw him overboard, and then they offer sacrifices and vows because the storm ceases.
[1370.14 --> 1372.24]  And the Lord appointed a fish to swallow Jonah.
[1373.28 --> 1374.12]  That's the story.
[1374.50 --> 1375.12]  We remember that.
[1375.78 --> 1378.94]  Now, there are three things to notice in this series of events.
[1378.94 --> 1381.20]  When you compare it to what he says in Jonah 2.
[1382.66 --> 1385.72]  One, the first thing is that Jonah is a prophet of the Lord.
[1386.28 --> 1391.10]  But, when he's told to prophesy, he goes in the opposite direction.
[1391.60 --> 1394.54]  To specifically get away from the presence of the Lord.
[1395.22 --> 1397.32]  Jonah willfully disobeys God's command.
[1398.36 --> 1403.68]  When Jonah identifies himself, to the sailors, as one who obeys, he says,
[1403.68 --> 1409.38]  I am a Hebrew who fears the Lord, God of heaven and earth, who made the sea and the land.
[1409.92 --> 1412.48]  But, Jonah knows he's disobeying.
[1412.94 --> 1414.52]  He knows that what he's doing is wrong.
[1414.66 --> 1419.56]  And by his own admission, him saying that the Lord is the Lord of heaven and earth,
[1419.98 --> 1421.48]  he knows he can't get away from him.
[1422.58 --> 1426.80]  And third, when they ask him what to do, he says, throw me into the sea.
[1426.80 --> 1429.24]  He tells them to kill him.
[1431.50 --> 1433.66]  Without any attempt at repentance.
[1434.52 --> 1435.86]  Jonah is a prophet of God.
[1436.26 --> 1437.74]  He knows that God would forgive.
[1438.52 --> 1440.24]  In chapter 4, Jonah says this about God.
[1440.92 --> 1443.80]  I knew you were gracious and compassionate, God.
[1444.12 --> 1446.66]  Slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love.
[1447.12 --> 1449.04]  A God who relents from sin and calamity.
[1450.16 --> 1451.90]  Jonah knows that his God would forgive him.
[1452.24 --> 1454.46]  But, he would rather die.
[1456.80 --> 1461.24]  This seems like a very different Jonah than the one who wrote the poem.
[1461.90 --> 1467.30]  The one who wrote the poem sounds like he understands and appreciates God's deliverance and salvation.
[1467.96 --> 1471.34]  The Jonah who wrote the poem sounds obedient, pious, and thankful.
[1473.84 --> 1479.46]  Jonah chapter 2 is telling us that Jonah needs the message he is carrying as much as the Ninevites.
[1480.42 --> 1484.18]  That he, in fact, is no better than the sinners or the pagans.
[1484.18 --> 1488.26]  That he hates so much, he would rather die than tell them the message from God.
[1489.00 --> 1491.92]  And that message is that God is gracious and compassionate.
[1492.52 --> 1494.78]  Slow to anger and abounding in love.
[1495.46 --> 1497.48]  A God who relents from sin and calamity.
[1498.24 --> 1499.70]  Salvation belongs to the Lord.
[1499.70 --> 1505.94]  To see this more clearly, we must go back to the text and piece together some ideas.
[1506.76 --> 1510.14]  We have the setting, and now we need to dive into the structure of the poem itself.
[1510.88 --> 1514.68]  As I said before, the poem Jonah writes here is a Thanksgiving psalm.
[1515.14 --> 1517.40]  The Thanksgiving psalm has six aspects to them.
[1517.40 --> 1526.20]  If you want to follow along or see it in your Bible yourselves, I'm going to read the aspects out in order so you can see the verses for the structure and how it forms.
[1526.88 --> 1530.18]  If there is a slide, there's no slide.
[1530.42 --> 1531.08]  There was a slide.
[1531.28 --> 1531.66]  That's okay.
[1532.14 --> 1533.26]  Oh, there it is.
[1533.40 --> 1533.74]  Awesome.
[1533.96 --> 1534.12]  Okay.
[1534.30 --> 1535.20]  So you can follow along.
[1535.26 --> 1535.94]  I have the verses up.
[1535.96 --> 1536.58]  I'm going to read them out.
[1536.84 --> 1537.04]  Okay.
[1537.92 --> 1539.64]  The introductory summary is first.
[1540.18 --> 1542.08]  In my distress, I called to the Lord.
[1542.30 --> 1543.12]  He answered me.
[1543.12 --> 1546.12]  The second is a recollection of the crisis.
[1546.84 --> 1548.66]  The engulfing waters threatened me.
[1548.96 --> 1549.94]  The deep surrounded me.
[1550.02 --> 1551.60]  The seaweed wrapped around my head.
[1552.28 --> 1553.88]  Third is a cry for help.
[1554.44 --> 1559.54]  When my life was ebbing away, I remembered you, Lord, and my prayer rose to you, to your holy temple.
[1561.02 --> 1563.62]  The fourth aspect is a description of the deliverance.
[1563.98 --> 1566.82]  But you, Lord my God, brought my life up from the pit.
[1567.42 --> 1568.94]  And fifth, the vows.
[1568.94 --> 1573.24]  But I, with shouts of grateful praise, will sacrifice to you, Lord.
[1573.96 --> 1575.36]  What I have vowed, I will make good.
[1575.76 --> 1576.80]  And sixth, praise.
[1577.68 --> 1579.48]  Salvation belongs to the Lord.
[1580.64 --> 1584.42]  Now, there are many examples of Thanksgiving psalms in the book of Psalms.
[1584.52 --> 1588.60]  But specifically, Psalm 32 is a good and concise example of this style.
[1588.72 --> 1592.84]  And I would recommend you read it so that you can see how this pattern continues in other psalms.
[1593.28 --> 1594.54]  But, back to Jonah.
[1594.54 --> 1600.76]  Now that we know the genre of the poem and its structure, we can see how Jonah perceives this whole situation.
[1601.24 --> 1603.00]  And what we find will surprise you.
[1604.36 --> 1606.86]  God sees this calamity as from God.
[1607.50 --> 1610.12]  You hurled me into the depths, into the very heart of the seas.
[1610.24 --> 1611.94]  The currents swirled around me.
[1612.80 --> 1614.84]  Jonah knows that only God can save him.
[1615.26 --> 1616.64]  Salvation belongs to the Lord.
[1616.64 --> 1620.38]  Two, Jonah knows that this storm is from God.
[1620.52 --> 1626.02]  And that the currents and the weeds that are dragging him to the depths, the place of the dead, are from God.
[1628.10 --> 1630.00]  We don't like hearing this.
[1630.44 --> 1635.46]  We don't like believing that God would use chaos, destruction, calamity, and pain.
[1636.22 --> 1640.38]  In short, we like it when God is silencing the storm with a calm voice.
[1640.38 --> 1643.10]  We don't like it when he's hurling the storm at us.
[1643.10 --> 1649.02]  But one of the most vital characteristics of who God is is his sovereignty.
[1650.00 --> 1651.82]  That his will reigns supreme.
[1652.38 --> 1659.30]  Which means that if he doesn't have control of the storm or the waves or suffering or pain or death, then he is not sovereign.
[1660.54 --> 1667.38]  And God not being sovereign is scarier and way, way, way worse than if he is Lord over the storm.
[1667.38 --> 1675.34]  Because if he's not sovereign, that means that when time comes, we can't pray as Jonah did for God to rescue us.
[1675.74 --> 1679.76]  If God is not the Lord over calamity, then when it comes, we have no hope.
[1680.40 --> 1681.60]  We have no comfort.
[1682.74 --> 1691.10]  However, if God is sovereign over those things, then we know that God in his perfect wisdom is somehow using it for good.
[1691.72 --> 1694.80]  We might not understand, but we have hope.
[1694.80 --> 1698.86]  As I said before, we don't like hearing this.
[1699.18 --> 1700.02]  Not today, at least.
[1700.78 --> 1706.80]  We are so comfortable in this blessed country, Canada, and so used to hearing that only God will rescue us,
[1706.86 --> 1710.94]  that when we hear that God is the one who sends the storm, we reject it.
[1712.88 --> 1718.94]  The Heidelberg Catechism, the document of Reformed Church, holds as a good reflection of the teachings of the Bible,
[1719.18 --> 1721.12]  speaks to this issue particularly well.
[1721.12 --> 1725.38]  The Lord's Day 10 speaks about God's sovereignty in this way.
[1729.10 --> 1731.50]  What do you understand by the providence of God?
[1732.60 --> 1735.82]  God's providence is his almighty and ever-present power,
[1736.18 --> 1740.72]  whereby as with his hand he still upholds heaven and earth and all creatures,
[1741.28 --> 1745.14]  and so governs them that leaf and blade, rain and drought,
[1745.14 --> 1751.20]  fruitful and barren years, food and drink, health and sickness, riches and poverty,
[1751.62 --> 1756.28]  indeed all things come to us not by chance, but by his fatherly hand.
[1756.28 --> 1765.76]  The author of Jonah and the writer of the Heidelberg Catechism are telling us that the fact that God is sovereign over the storm
[1765.76 --> 1770.34]  is not a thing that should strike terror in our hearts, but rather stir hope.
[1771.18 --> 1779.16]  For this reason, God is able to use every moment and every act with an appropriate measure of justice and mercy
[1779.16 --> 1782.56]  in both Jonah's lives and ours.
[1783.14 --> 1786.94]  For because of this, we can declare with Jonah that salvation belongs to the Lord.
[1788.66 --> 1789.70]  Remember that for later.
[1792.26 --> 1797.32]  Jonah acknowledges that him being in the raging storm and drowning is because of God.
[1798.86 --> 1801.34]  Jonah leaves out a very important part of the whole story, though.
[1801.34 --> 1810.50]  Jonah makes no mention of his sin, of his blatant and willing disobedience to prophesy to Nineveh.
[1811.52 --> 1815.98]  Jonah does say that it is the Lord who saves him, and without the Lord he would be dead,
[1816.78 --> 1822.52]  but Jonah also says that it's because he, Jonah, will make the sacrifice,
[1822.96 --> 1827.76]  that he, Jonah, will make the vows, that he, Jonah, prayed to God, that he, Jonah, cried out.
[1827.76 --> 1830.00]  It was Jonah who remembered God.
[1830.22 --> 1832.32]  The Lord heard him and saved him as a result,
[1833.00 --> 1835.36]  unlike the idol worshipers who give up their salvation.
[1837.26 --> 1841.62]  There's another story that has similarities to Jonah that you may be familiar with,
[1841.96 --> 1843.18]  the story of Noah.
[1844.18 --> 1845.80]  Noah is told by God to build an ark
[1845.80 --> 1850.34]  because God was going to send a flood to wipe out man's sin from the earth by killing them all.
[1851.30 --> 1853.90]  Unlike Jonah, Noah was faithfully obeying.
[1853.90 --> 1860.08]  God, he builds the ark, and two of every animal are saved because salvation belongs to the Lord.
[1860.88 --> 1864.14]  Noah finds himself in a similarly dismal situation as Jonah.
[1864.78 --> 1865.92]  He's in a chaotic ocean.
[1866.52 --> 1869.22]  Noah is in a giant boat that's saving his life,
[1869.76 --> 1871.80]  and this chaos was because of sin.
[1873.52 --> 1879.58]  In this story, the central phrase and the central theme of the whole story of Noah is Genesis 8-1.
[1880.14 --> 1881.86]  God remembered Noah.
[1881.86 --> 1886.22]  And then God relented from disaster and the floodwaters subsided.
[1887.36 --> 1890.84]  The central theme was not Noah remembered God,
[1891.32 --> 1894.88]  then promised to do some sacrifices, make some vows, and God rescued him.
[1895.54 --> 1895.90]  No.
[1896.62 --> 1898.02]  God remembered Noah.
[1898.44 --> 1899.74]  God sent the flood.
[1900.20 --> 1901.20]  God saved Noah.
[1901.64 --> 1903.52]  The same thing is happening with Jonah.
[1904.16 --> 1905.30]  God sent the storm.
[1905.76 --> 1907.20]  God saved Jonah.
[1907.20 --> 1916.40]  Now, if we bring everything we've learned together about the setting, the story, what leads him to cry out,
[1916.62 --> 1920.32]  and what is in the psalm, we see that Jonah is a man of contradiction.
[1921.38 --> 1922.62]  These are the contradictions.
[1923.16 --> 1927.54]  Jonah is a prophet of God, and yet he refuses to prophesy.
[1927.54 --> 1934.12]  Jonah is running from the presence of God, and yet when he tells the sailors about God,
[1934.84 --> 1937.54]  Jonah says that the Lord is the God of the whole earth and made everything.
[1937.54 --> 1944.22]  The third contradiction is that Jonah is so desperate to avoid prophesying to Nineveh that he wants to die,
[1944.72 --> 1950.78]  and he gets them to throw him overboard, and yet he is thankful to God who delivers him from his drowning.
[1951.82 --> 1958.30]  And four, Jonah admits that the storm is there because of his sin, and yet doesn't repent of his sin.
[1958.30 --> 1966.22]  He just cries out because he's in distress, and because he remembered God and promised sacrifices and vows, and God saves him.
[1968.36 --> 1974.06]  With all these contradictory beliefs, Jonah is a man who knows better and yet doesn't do better.
[1974.76 --> 1976.24]  He's a hypocrite, a sinner.
[1977.24 --> 1979.72]  This isn't the VeggieTales version of Jonah that we're used to.
[1979.72 --> 1988.90]  However, when I read this story, I see me.
[1989.80 --> 1995.82]  On one hand, I see my sin, my failure, my disobedience, my reluctance to obey.
[1996.60 --> 2002.24]  And yet, on the other hand, I see my theology degree, I see my pattern of prayer, my study of the Word.
[2002.58 --> 2004.24]  I see my job here, doing this.
[2004.72 --> 2007.74]  I see that I know better, and yet I don't do better.
[2007.74 --> 2013.50]  Jonah, like myself, like us, we know better.
[2014.18 --> 2020.14]  We know that we've been called to obey, and we know that God has called us to do, and yet we continue to sin.
[2020.84 --> 2026.38]  We are men and women of contradiction, saved by Christ, and yet we sin.
[2028.64 --> 2033.68]  And when we feel the call of God to obey, to stop repeating the same sins over and over,
[2033.68 --> 2039.10]  sometimes we listen, but sometimes we continue because we don't want to obey.
[2039.80 --> 2043.78]  We would rather continue in sin because to obey would be uncomfortable.
[2044.86 --> 2049.56]  Sometimes we feel God telling us to say something to someone, to go tell someone about Him,
[2049.88 --> 2054.82]  to go say to someone that God is a redemptive God, that they can find redemption in Christ.
[2054.82 --> 2057.88]  But we don't do it because it makes us feel uncomfortable.
[2059.44 --> 2064.78]  A person could be saved from hell, and we let our discomfort get in the way.
[2072.26 --> 2075.78]  But let's remember, salvation belongs to the Lord.
[2076.56 --> 2077.52]  And this is where it matters.
[2077.52 --> 2081.70]  We as Christians know that our salvation is secured.
[2082.10 --> 2084.72]  It's secured because God is faithful to keep His promises.
[2085.26 --> 2088.72]  And we who have been baptized with Christ have been promised new life.
[2089.86 --> 2092.04]  1 John 11, 13 says it best.
[2092.60 --> 2093.54]  And this is the testimony.
[2094.26 --> 2097.92]  God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son.
[2098.54 --> 2100.16]  Whoever has the Son has life.
[2100.50 --> 2102.74]  Whoever does not have the Son does not have life.
[2102.74 --> 2109.88]  I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life.
[2112.04 --> 2114.44]  Our sins may be many.
[2115.38 --> 2120.26]  But as Jonah and we know, God is gracious and compassionate.
[2121.10 --> 2123.94]  Slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love.
[2124.84 --> 2126.18]  Relenting from disaster.
[2127.10 --> 2130.54]  And we see that in Jesus our Savior so, so clearly.
[2130.54 --> 2134.56]  And ultimately, the story of Jonah and this prayer is not about Jonah.
[2135.26 --> 2138.66]  This book, like everything else in the Bible, leads to the central figure.
[2139.30 --> 2139.70]  Jesus.
[2140.50 --> 2141.42]  Let me show you how.
[2142.26 --> 2147.12]  As I said before, the structure of the Hebrew poetry is part of understanding what it is saying.
[2147.88 --> 2150.32]  And in this case, we must look at the words being used.
[2151.70 --> 2153.56]  In chapter 117, it says,
[2153.68 --> 2155.20]  Jonah is in the belly of the fish.
[2155.78 --> 2158.98]  The word here for fish is in the masculine form.
[2158.98 --> 2162.96]  Which is interesting because in Jonah chapter 2, verse 1,
[2163.52 --> 2166.20]  it states again that he's in the belly of the fish.
[2166.38 --> 2168.30]  But he uses the feminine version of the word.
[2169.14 --> 2169.60]  It's weird.
[2169.86 --> 2171.04]  It's only one verse later.
[2172.42 --> 2173.74]  And the Hebrew word can be read,
[2174.08 --> 2179.16]  when the word stomach in Hebrew is read next to the female version of an animal,
[2179.34 --> 2181.14]  it can be rendered as womb.
[2181.14 --> 2186.66]  Now, before anyone gets crazy and tells me how that would be impossible, Josh,
[2186.70 --> 2189.34]  how does something get eaten and then end up in the womb of an animal,
[2189.80 --> 2191.18]  I'm not saying that that's what happened.
[2191.28 --> 2192.74]  Neither is the author of Jonah.
[2193.94 --> 2194.92]  It's just an image.
[2194.92 --> 2201.88]  But by hinting at the word that it can also mean womb in this context,
[2201.98 --> 2206.40]  the author of the book is telling us that Jonah was spiritually born again.
[2207.60 --> 2208.36]  Think about it.
[2208.70 --> 2212.16]  Jonah goes down to the bottom of the sea to Sheol, the place of the dead.
[2212.58 --> 2213.82]  He's swallowed by a fish,
[2214.02 --> 2217.72]  and then three days later is brought up because he was in its womb.
[2218.54 --> 2219.50]  Jonah was born again.
[2220.50 --> 2223.22]  In this story, it's a story of new life.
[2223.74 --> 2226.54]  Jonah goes through what we would call an image of baptism.
[2227.10 --> 2229.92]  Like us, Jonah was saved by God from a calamity,
[2230.34 --> 2233.88]  and despite what Jonah says in his psalm about the kinds of prayers he will send
[2233.88 --> 2236.16]  or the sacrifices he will make,
[2236.64 --> 2239.74]  none of that was what we as the reader know saved him.
[2241.08 --> 2242.68]  Jonah chapter 117, it says,
[2242.82 --> 2245.02]  Now the Lord provided a huge fish to swallow Jonah.
[2245.66 --> 2248.12]  Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.
[2248.12 --> 2252.96]  This is without any mention of his prayer for help or his promises to God.
[2253.66 --> 2258.04]  God sent the fish to save Jonah before he even wanted to be saved
[2258.04 --> 2261.62]  so that Jonah could go and prophesy to the Ninevites
[2261.62 --> 2265.12]  so that they could learn that God was gracious and compassionate,
[2265.52 --> 2268.32]  so that they could know it was God who remembered Noah.
[2268.68 --> 2270.90]  It was God who was faithful to his vows.
[2271.22 --> 2273.48]  It was God who made the proper sacrifice.
[2273.48 --> 2277.12]  And that sacrifice is Jesus.
[2277.98 --> 2280.96]  Jesus, unlike Jonah, was obedient unto death.
[2281.62 --> 2283.54]  Jesus lived the perfect life pleasing to God.
[2283.90 --> 2286.10]  He obeyed the law and fulfilled the vows.
[2286.54 --> 2288.84]  He prophesied to his enemies, us.
[2289.16 --> 2291.94]  And when calamity came to Jesus, he was put on the cross,
[2292.14 --> 2294.32]  the cross he was sent by his Father to endure.
[2294.32 --> 2301.30]  And he cried out to the Lord, his Father.
[2302.32 --> 2305.46]  And God raised him from the dead because before Jesus was even on that cross,
[2305.54 --> 2308.76]  he was appointed that on the third day he would be risen from the dead.
[2309.60 --> 2317.38]  In God's justice, he poured out his wrath on Jesus who wore our sin.
[2317.38 --> 2323.04]  And God poured his mercy on us, his enemies who wore his righteousness,
[2323.42 --> 2326.44]  so that we could come to know that God was gracious and compassionate,
[2326.96 --> 2329.52]  slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love,
[2329.96 --> 2331.40]  relenting from disaster.
[2333.36 --> 2336.52]  We who were chosen before the foundations of the earth,
[2336.92 --> 2339.36]  we who were a chosen people, a royal priesthood,
[2339.84 --> 2343.50]  we who have been saved before we ever wanted to be saved,
[2343.70 --> 2347.04]  we who were baptized, descended into those waters with Christ,
[2347.04 --> 2348.16]  and were born again.
[2348.72 --> 2351.30]  We who sinned and did not deserve to be saved,
[2351.68 --> 2353.92]  declare that salvation belongs to the Lord.
[2359.10 --> 2361.52]  All of this forever changes us.
[2362.34 --> 2364.66]  We tend to think that our identity is what we do.
[2364.98 --> 2367.38]  In Jonah's case, this was being a good Hebrew
[2367.38 --> 2370.12]  who made the proper sacrifice and vowed the right vows.
[2370.66 --> 2373.42]  The one who, unlike the idol worshipers, worships God properly.
[2374.34 --> 2375.44]  But this isn't our identity.
[2375.44 --> 2380.50]  As Christians, we have an identity placed on us by God's gracious gift of life.
[2381.10 --> 2384.48]  Freed from sinner and redeemed child of God is our identity.
[2385.08 --> 2388.86]  Joined to err with Christ and fellow brother and sister in the church is our identity.
[2388.86 --> 2392.64]  This was not because we did something,
[2393.14 --> 2394.96]  but because of something he did.
[2396.84 --> 2400.16]  And now we, the child of God, the brother in Christ,
[2400.78 --> 2402.44]  and sister in Christ,
[2402.70 --> 2404.86]  have been sent to go and preach the good news.
[2405.28 --> 2407.08]  We don't do this to earn our salvation
[2407.08 --> 2409.24]  or out of fear that one day when we're on the sea,
[2409.30 --> 2410.48]  we might be caught in a storm,
[2411.30 --> 2412.74]  but because that's what we are.
[2414.22 --> 2416.48]  Jonah was sent by God to go and prophesy to Nineveh
[2416.48 --> 2418.48]  so that we could be saved from destruction.
[2419.46 --> 2421.50]  We have been sent by God to go do the same,
[2421.86 --> 2423.06]  to go and preach good news
[2423.06 --> 2424.94]  so that people could be saved from destruction
[2424.94 --> 2426.88]  and have right relationship with God.
[2427.50 --> 2429.26]  As Christians, we have been sent
[2429.26 --> 2431.02]  and commanded, like Jonah,
[2431.14 --> 2433.76]  to go and preach by the Lord of heaven and earth.
[2434.84 --> 2437.22]  Matthew 28, 18 to 19 says this,
[2437.22 --> 2439.52]  Then Jesus came to them and said,
[2439.76 --> 2442.06]  All authority in heaven and on earth
[2442.06 --> 2443.30]  has been given to me.
[2443.94 --> 2445.62]  Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations,
[2446.18 --> 2447.74]  baptizing them in the name of the Father
[2447.74 --> 2449.66]  and in the Son and in the Holy Spirit.
[2450.14 --> 2452.18]  The name of the Father and the Son
[2452.18 --> 2454.14]  and the Holy Spirit has been placed on us
[2454.14 --> 2455.40]  at new life.
[2455.98 --> 2457.22]  This is our identity.
[2458.00 --> 2459.56]  And like Jonah, who was his prophet,
[2459.86 --> 2462.70]  we, his disciples, have been sent to go to the nations,
[2463.12 --> 2464.16]  nations like Nineveh,
[2464.16 --> 2466.82]  to preach that God is gracious and compassionate,
[2467.36 --> 2468.14]  slow to anger,
[2469.20 --> 2470.80]  and abounding in steadfast love,
[2471.34 --> 2473.00]  and relenting from disaster.
[2475.26 --> 2478.28]  God is sovereign over the storm he sends to Jonah
[2478.28 --> 2479.20]  to turn him around.
[2479.64 --> 2482.64]  And he is sovereign in sending the fish to swallow Jonah
[2482.64 --> 2484.10]  and to bring him to Nineveh.
[2484.64 --> 2486.54]  God is sovereign in Christ being arrested
[2486.54 --> 2488.00]  and to swallow Jonah,
[2489.00 --> 2489.36]  arrested,
[2489.80 --> 2491.72]  God is sovereign in the world killing his son
[2491.72 --> 2492.54]  to save the world.
[2492.54 --> 2495.62]  God is sovereign in saving us from his wrath,
[2495.78 --> 2497.10]  and he is sovereign in sending us
[2497.10 --> 2498.14]  to preach his good news.
[2499.66 --> 2502.04]  We don't do all these things
[2502.04 --> 2505.08]  so that we receive God's grace and compassion,
[2505.48 --> 2508.72]  but because we have received God's grace and compassion.
[2510.00 --> 2513.10]  Remember, salvation doesn't belong to us.
[2514.28 --> 2516.18]  Salvation belongs to the Lord.
[2518.54 --> 2519.28]  Let's pray.
[2519.28 --> 2519.30]  Let's pray.
[2522.54 --> 2525.78]  God, Lord,
[2526.10 --> 2527.56]  creator of heaven and earth,
[2528.52 --> 2529.84]  the sea and the dry land,
[2531.08 --> 2531.66]  I pray, Lord,
[2531.74 --> 2532.96]  that as we hear this message,
[2533.40 --> 2535.18]  that we would go at your call,
[2536.18 --> 2539.38]  that we would spread the news,
[2539.74 --> 2540.84]  the gospel message, Lord,
[2540.90 --> 2542.26]  that you are gracious and compassionate,
[2542.48 --> 2544.56]  slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love,
[2544.70 --> 2546.28]  that you relent from disaster,
[2546.28 --> 2548.82]  and that your son was the gift,
[2548.98 --> 2549.76]  the sacrifice,
[2550.02 --> 2550.38]  the vow.
[2552.04 --> 2552.72]  I pray, Lord,
[2553.36 --> 2556.08]  that we would do this to your glory
[2556.08 --> 2557.92]  and that your spirit be with us wherever we go.
[2558.70 --> 2558.96]  Amen.
[2558.96 --> 2559.06]  Amen.
[2559.06 --> 2559.10]  Amen.
[2567.94 --> 2568.86]  Amen.
[2568.86 --> 2570.10]  Amen.
[2570.10 --> 2570.90]  Amen.
[2570.90 --> 2572.86]  Amen.
[2572.86 --> 2573.06]  Amen.
[2573.06 --> 2573.10]  Amen.
[2573.10 --> 2575.04]  Amen.
[2575.04 --> 2575.24]  Amen.
