[346.44 --> 348.44]  Amen.
[376.44 --> 378.44]  Amen.
[406.44 --> 408.44]  Amen.
[436.44 --> 438.44]  Amen.
[466.44 --> 468.44]  Amen.
[496.44 --> 498.44]  Amen.
[526.44 --> 549.58]  Good morning.
[551.64 --> 553.52]  We got there eventually.
[553.68 --> 553.90]  Great.
[554.30 --> 555.90]  Welcome to worship.
[556.44 --> 561.90]  My name is Chris, I'm one of the pastors here, and it's my privilege, along with a few others
[561.90 --> 567.60]  here on stage, and some people you don't yet see, anticipation to lead you in our shared
[567.60 --> 569.46]  worship together this morning.
[570.26 --> 573.64]  Before we begin, we have a couple of announcements, and so I'm going to invite Brandon to come
[573.64 --> 579.58]  up and get ready for that, and while he's making his way up, I want to just let you
[579.58 --> 584.12]  know that on Wednesday night, this coming week, Wednesday night, we are going to have
[584.12 --> 590.54]  a prayer service here at 7 p.m., and so you're all invited to join us as we gather together
[590.54 --> 595.02]  to pray for the ministries of our church and our denomination and for the kingdom of God
[595.02 --> 602.60]  throughout the world, and we will pray in song and spoken in large group and in small group,
[602.60 --> 609.30]  and so we encourage you all to come Wednesday evening, 7 p.m., here for that prayer time
[609.30 --> 609.86]  together.
[609.86 --> 614.32]  Yeah, two things from the Spring Mexico team.
[614.94 --> 617.52]  One is thank you for everybody who came out last night to the Mexico dinner.
[618.06 --> 620.18]  We did amazing in terms of fundraising.
[620.40 --> 624.28]  I think everybody had a good time as well, but it was, it actually did break, at least
[624.28 --> 628.40]  in 17 years, is the most money we've ever raised, so thank you for that, guys.
[628.42 --> 628.94]  That was awesome.
[629.40 --> 629.72]  Congratulations.
[630.06 --> 631.20]  A round of applause for you.
[631.20 --> 638.74]  The second one is, we're next Sunday, which is, I believe, also our going away service
[638.74 --> 643.62]  thingy, whatever they call that, we're doing a pancake breakfast beforehand for the congregation.
[643.82 --> 644.68]  Again, it's by donation.
[644.76 --> 645.92]  There's no minimum donation, though.
[645.96 --> 648.92]  It's more just, we're trying to cover the cost of the pancake stuff and just have a good
[648.92 --> 649.56]  time with you guys.
[649.56 --> 654.38]  So for that one, that'll, doors will open around kind of 8.30, we'll start serving pancakes.
[654.58 --> 659.18]  By 9.30, the pancakes will be going away and we'll be rushing to clean up for church again.
[659.40 --> 662.06]  So just hope to see you all there for that, too.
[662.16 --> 662.48]  Thank you.
[662.48 --> 672.40]  Continuing with some announcements.
[673.54 --> 679.68]  After service today is youth coffee, and so that's for everyone in our youth ministry.
[680.36 --> 685.24]  You are heading out to a member's house for coffee together.
[685.72 --> 689.70]  If you have any questions about that, you can grab Pastor Kevin and he'll give you directions
[689.70 --> 691.18]  and location and the like.
[691.18 --> 700.20]  As well, this evening is a young adults board games event here at the church, and I've been
[700.20 --> 704.42]  told that you can talk to Big Jerry about who that is.
[708.10 --> 709.30]  That's Jared, right?
[709.46 --> 709.64]  Yeah?
[709.78 --> 709.96]  Okay.
[710.06 --> 712.04]  So you can talk to Jared, Big Jerry.
[712.18 --> 713.18]  That's a new one for me, man.
[714.22 --> 716.14]  And he will give you details on that.
[716.14 --> 721.90]  Additionally, this week, our church is hosting classes.
[722.90 --> 728.94]  Classes is the regional gathering of Christian Reformed churches, and we are meeting here on
[728.94 --> 731.46]  Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday morning.
[731.86 --> 736.32]  And so to help facilitate that, we have a number of volunteers who are making that happen,
[736.40 --> 737.70]  and we're so grateful for you.
[737.70 --> 741.86]  But we also need to set up this space for the meeting.
[742.58 --> 748.10]  And so tomorrow night, Monday night at 7 o'clock, a group of us will be gathering here to stack
[748.10 --> 749.72]  chairs and pool tables and the like.
[749.78 --> 752.88]  If you're available for that, many hands make light work.
[753.34 --> 755.78]  Please come tomorrow night, 7 o'clock.
[755.88 --> 756.78]  We'll set that up.
[756.78 --> 762.70]  Hopefully, it will only take half an hour, 45 minutes or so, and then we can be ready for
[762.70 --> 764.42]  Tuesday morning with that.
[766.66 --> 768.50]  I think those are my announcements.
[768.78 --> 774.58]  And so I'm going to invite you, as you are able to stand, as we are ushered into the presence
[774.58 --> 778.68]  of our God, we are greeted by Him here in worship.
[778.68 --> 785.70]  One of the special and amazing privileges of worship is that when we gather as the people
[785.70 --> 792.24]  of God around His Word and to sing His praises, God promises to show up in mighty and powerful
[792.24 --> 792.68]  ways.
[793.36 --> 799.42]  So God is here, and He invites you now to Himself, and so receive His greeting.
[800.76 --> 807.20]  Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, His Son,
[807.20 --> 811.26]  and our Savior, through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[812.30 --> 812.70]  Amen.
[837.20 --> 857.28]  Let us worship God, who reconciled us to Himself through Christ.
[857.66 --> 858.94]  We are new creations.
[859.58 --> 861.36]  The old is gone, and the new has come.
[861.88 --> 866.02]  Let us worship God as Christ's ambassadors, through us and through our worship.
[866.02 --> 868.24]  May we announce the good news to all.
[868.78 --> 870.94]  Let us worship God in spirit and in truth.
[871.40 --> 872.08]  Praise God.
[872.30 --> 873.26]  We are reconciled.
[873.48 --> 874.22]  We are redeemed.
[874.48 --> 875.22]  And we are renewed.
[875.22 --> 899.62]  Come, people of the risen King, who delight to bring Him praise.
[899.62 --> 907.88]  Come, people of the risen King, who delight to bring Him praise.
[907.88 --> 916.04]  From the shifting shadows of the earth, we will lift our eyes to Him.

[924.26 --> 933.08]  Rejoice, rejoice, let every tongue rejoice.
[933.08 --> 937.24]  One heart, one voice.

[1172.24 --> 1178.00]  And I hope by thy good pleasure
[1178.00 --> 1183.34]  Safely to arrive at home
[1183.34 --> 1189.20]  Jesus sought me when a stranger

[1194.72 --> 1200.38]  He to rescue me from danger
[1200.38 --> 1205.34]  Interposed his precious blood

[1247.96 --> 1250.96]  Here's my heart Lord
[1250.96 --> 1253.44]  Take and seal it
[1253.44 --> 1261.96]  Seal it for thy courts above all else
[1261.96 --> 1267.82]  I adore your name
[1267.82 --> 1273.34]  Above all else
[1273.34 --> 1279.26]  Tune my heart to sing your praise

[1346.30 --> 1350.42]  To the name of all
[1350.42 --> 1352.44]  Every name
[1352.44 --> 1377.32]  every day
[1382.44 --> 1389.04]  This is our time for a prayer of confession.
[1391.04 --> 1395.62]  There will be a pause where we can reflect on our own confessions.
[1397.56 --> 1398.52]  Let's pray.
[1403.40 --> 1405.74]  O God, our great shepherd,
[1406.60 --> 1409.40]  you tenderly gather us as lambs,
[1409.40 --> 1412.96]  carrying us with all your embracing love.
[1415.68 --> 1419.36]  Yet, like sheep, we wander from you,
[1420.40 --> 1423.58]  following our own ways, ignoring your voice,
[1424.40 --> 1428.20]  trusting, distrusting your provisions.
[1430.60 --> 1433.54]  Forgive our stubborn rebellion, our hardened hearts,
[1434.14 --> 1435.34]  our lack of trust.
[1435.34 --> 1440.78]  Refresh us once again by your quiet waters of mercy,
[1441.56 --> 1444.08]  and restore our souls by your redeeming love.
[1445.96 --> 1449.92]  Guide our paths that we might follow you more closely.
[1449.92 --> 1450.92]  Amen.
[1450.92 --> 1451.92]  Amen.
[1455.36 --> 1473.80]  We pray this through Jesus Christ, our good shepherd.
[1475.54 --> 1476.30]  Amen.
[1476.30 --> 1479.70]  From Psalm 32,
[1480.08 --> 1483.04]  Blessed is the one whose transgressions are forgiven,
[1483.84 --> 1485.26]  whose sins are covered.
[1486.24 --> 1490.90]  Blessed is the one whose sin the Lord does not count against them,
[1491.58 --> 1493.70]  and in whose spirit is no deceit.
[1493.70 --> 1495.42]  Blessed is the one whose transgressions are forgiven,
[1495.42 --> 1503.58]  especially if the angemise.
[1503.58 --> 1503.84]  We pray this through Jesus Christ, our love.
[1503.84 --> 1506.06]  It was the one whose contributing to Jesus Christ, our love.
[1507.06 --> 1510.82]  That we pay for which with theBN whoever.

[1522.82 --> 1527.08]  I am weak.
[1527.78 --> 1532.18]  I need your love to free me.

[1629.32 --> 1637.20]  And my desire is to follow you forever.
[1637.20 --> 1638.02]  For you are good.
[1638.02 --> 1642.54]  For you are good.
[1642.54 --> 1646.72]  For you are good to me.

[1978.22 --> 1979.60]  I invite you to be seated.
[1981.82 --> 2001.42]  Hello.
[2001.42 --> 2004.34]  Hey, my name is Mike.
[2004.34 --> 2006.34]  I'm one of the deacons here.
[2006.34 --> 2011.42]  Today's special offering is for World Renew Canada Foods Grain Bank.
[2011.42 --> 2017.84]  At the moment, 28 million people around the world are struggling with hunger.
[2017.84 --> 2022.18]  World Renew, with its supporters and partners, are responding.
[2022.18 --> 2023.54]  Here is a short video.
[2023.54 --> 2024.42]  Please give generously.
[2024.42 --> 2054.42] 
[2054.42 --> 2084.42] 
[2084.42 --> 2114.42] 
[2114.42 --> 2118.84]  Just how much more God can do than they could have ever imagined.
[2118.84 --> 2123.42]  By working together with their community, they are envisioning new ways to thrive.
[2123.42 --> 2124.42]  And we'll see you next time.
[2124.42 --> 2125.42]  Thank you.
[2125.42 --> 2126.42]  And we'll see you next time.
[2126.42 --> 2127.42]  Thank you.
[2127.42 --> 2156.18]  Take my life and let it be.
[2156.18 --> 2157.18]  Take my hand.
[2157.18 --> 2163.18]  Let them flow in endless praise.
[2163.18 --> 2170.18]  Let them flow in endless praise.
[2170.18 --> 2177.18]  Let them flow in endless praise.
[2177.18 --> 2192.18]  Take my hands and let them move at the impulse of thy love.
[2192.18 --> 2199.18]  Take my feet and let them be.
[2199.18 --> 2200.18]  Take my hand.
[2200.18 --> 2201.18]  Let them flow in endless praise.
[2201.18 --> 2202.18]  Take my hand.
[2202.18 --> 2203.18]  Let them flow in endless praise.
[2203.18 --> 2204.18]  Let them flow in endless praise.
[2204.18 --> 2205.18]  Let them flow in endless praise.
[2205.18 --> 2207.18]  Let them flow in endless praise.
[2207.18 --> 2209.18]  Let them flow in endless praise.
[2209.18 --> 2217.16]  Take my silver and my gold
[2217.16 --> 2221.78]  Not a might would I withhold
[2221.78 --> 2227.90]  Take my intellect and use
[2227.90 --> 2233.20]  Every power as thou shalt choose
[2233.20 --> 2238.80]  Every power as thou shalt choose
[2238.80 --> 2247.76]  Take my will and make it thine
[2247.76 --> 2252.92]  It shall be no longer mine
[2252.92 --> 2258.28]  Take my heart, it is thy door
[2258.28 --> 2263.28]  It shall be thy royal throne
[2263.28 --> 2268.48]  It shall be thy royal throne
[2268.48 --> 2277.44]  Take my love, my Lord, I pour
[2277.44 --> 2283.34]  At thy feet is treasure store
[2283.34 --> 2288.44]  Take myself and I will be
[2288.44 --> 2293.40]  Ever only all for thee
[2293.40 --> 2299.40]  Ever only all for thee
[2299.40 --> 2323.24]  I'd like to invite any kids here from age three up to grade four to come join us at the front
[2323.24 --> 2327.56]  Before we head off to continue worshipping and children's worship time
[2327.56 --> 2342.64]  So today we are going to be talking about a really big word which is perseverance
[2342.64 --> 2348.04]  Does anybody know what perseverance means already?
[2348.22 --> 2349.30]  Any of our kids here?
[2349.38 --> 2350.76]  Oh, maybe some of our older ones
[2350.76 --> 2358.88]  She said it means if you don't give up
[2358.88 --> 2361.06]  That is a great way to summarize it
[2361.06 --> 2364.98]  So perseverance is when something is hard and you keep trying and you don't give up
[2364.98 --> 2368.60]  So I'm going to tell you a little story about perseverance
[2368.60 --> 2373.84]  It was, I think it was last summer we decided to go on a hike with our family
[2373.84 --> 2376.14]  Has anyone ever been on a hike with their family?
[2376.34 --> 2377.52]  Yeah? Oh great, lots of you
[2377.52 --> 2381.70]  So we decided to go on a hike that was mostly uphill
[2381.70 --> 2386.90]  And it took about maybe an hour and a half to get all the way up to the top
[2386.90 --> 2388.98]  And it was like this the whole time
[2388.98 --> 2392.58]  And you can imagine that that might have been a little bit hard
[2392.58 --> 2395.16]  And some of my kids asked a lot of questions
[2395.16 --> 2397.62]  Actually they mostly asked one question
[2397.62 --> 2401.18]  How much farther until we're at the top?
[2401.26 --> 2403.20]  Or how much longer is it?
[2403.46 --> 2404.92]  Or maybe there was two questions
[2404.92 --> 2407.04]  Can we turn around and go back to the car?
[2408.32 --> 2409.96]  It was a long way up
[2409.96 --> 2412.46]  And they had to work really hard and keep going
[2412.46 --> 2415.04]  And we had to encourage them and hold their hands
[2415.04 --> 2416.68]  And climb over big routes
[2416.68 --> 2418.82]  But eventually we made it to the top
[2418.82 --> 2420.60]  And we got to see a beautiful lake
[2420.60 --> 2422.34]  And a beautiful view
[2422.34 --> 2425.90]  So they did a great job of persevering there
[2425.90 --> 2428.82]  We're going to talk today though
[2428.82 --> 2430.72]  In the Bible about a man, David
[2430.72 --> 2433.12]  We've been talking about David and how he persevered
[2433.12 --> 2435.88]  And I'd like to hear maybe some stories from you
[2435.88 --> 2437.32]  About something you've done that's hard
[2437.32 --> 2438.32]  And you didn't have to get up
[2438.32 --> 2439.94]  So before we do that
[2439.94 --> 2441.10]  We're going to stand up
[2441.10 --> 2443.78]  And we're going to bless the rest of our church family
[2443.78 --> 2446.28]  And receive their blessing in return
[2446.28 --> 2449.78]  So we're going to put our hands up
[2449.78 --> 2458.50]  Thank you
[2468.32 --> 2488.70]  Good morning, my name's Sam
[2488.70 --> 2490.40]  And I'm a member here at Emmanuel
[2490.40 --> 2493.24]  And it's my privilege to lead you in our family prayer
[2493.24 --> 2496.28]  Just wanted to remind you that next Sunday
[2496.28 --> 2498.96]  We are going to be participating in the Lord's Supper
[2498.96 --> 2501.84]  So we ask that you would consider that
[2501.84 --> 2503.70]  As you go through this coming week
[2503.70 --> 2506.02]  Please pray with me
[2506.02 --> 2508.36]  Eternal God
[2508.36 --> 2510.04]  Creator of all
[2510.04 --> 2512.36]  You are indeed the King of glory
[2512.36 --> 2514.66]  And we humbly come before you today
[2514.66 --> 2517.16]  Recognizing your amazing love
[2517.16 --> 2519.24]  For people in this broken world
[2519.24 --> 2520.24]  That we live in
[2520.24 --> 2522.66]  The psalmist reminds us
[2522.66 --> 2525.28]  That when we lift our eyes to the mountains
[2525.28 --> 2527.28]  Where does our help come from?
[2527.90 --> 2529.40]  Our help comes from the Lord
[2529.40 --> 2530.90]  Maker of heaven and earth
[2530.90 --> 2533.40]  You will not let our foot slip
[2533.40 --> 2535.00]  You watch over us
[2535.00 --> 2536.76]  You do not slumber
[2536.76 --> 2538.70]  Indeed you watch over Israel
[2538.70 --> 2540.74]  That will not slumber nor sleep
[2540.74 --> 2543.18]  You, O Lord, will keep us from all harm
[2543.18 --> 2545.12]  Watch over our life
[2545.12 --> 2548.98]  You, Lord, will watch over our coming and going
[2548.98 --> 2551.48]  Both now and forevermore
[2551.48 --> 2554.46]  We stand amazed at your grace
[2554.46 --> 2556.68]  Which saved a wretch like me
[2556.68 --> 2558.30]  Once we were lost
[2558.30 --> 2559.64]  But now we have found
[2559.64 --> 2560.54]  Was blind
[2560.54 --> 2561.54]  But now we see
[2561.54 --> 2564.80]  Through many dangers, toils, and snares
[2564.80 --> 2566.24]  I have already come
[2566.24 --> 2569.26]  This grace has brought me safe thus far
[2569.26 --> 2571.22]  And grace will lead me home
[2571.22 --> 2573.40]  You are faithful
[2573.40 --> 2575.06]  And you know each of us
[2575.06 --> 2577.16]  Better than we know ourselves
[2577.16 --> 2579.32]  We believe in you, Lord
[2579.32 --> 2581.70]  Help us in our unbelief
[2581.70 --> 2585.34]  We recognize our world is in turmoil
[2585.34 --> 2588.34]  We see the devastation in Turkey and Syria
[2588.34 --> 2590.86]  We pray for goodness and comfort
[2590.86 --> 2591.96]  To those in despair
[2591.96 --> 2594.72]  We see the war in Ukraine
[2594.72 --> 2596.82]  Bring your peace, we pray
[2596.82 --> 2599.02]  For the many who suffer injustice
[2599.02 --> 2601.54]  Give them goodness and peace
[2601.54 --> 2604.24]  We pray for those in our community
[2604.24 --> 2605.98]  That mourn the loss of loved ones
[2605.98 --> 2608.22]  We pray for the Harris family
[2608.22 --> 2611.34]  For Leanne as she makes her way back home today
[2611.34 --> 2614.70]  The Birken Passes and the Chepkama families
[2614.70 --> 2617.84]  Allow them to experience comfort and peace
[2617.84 --> 2619.64]  During this very difficult time
[2619.64 --> 2622.66]  We think of others who are mourning loss
[2622.66 --> 2625.22]  Some recently, some not so recent
[2625.22 --> 2628.28]  We also lift up Sai and greet a viscera
[2628.28 --> 2631.14]  As Sai begins the treatment for cancer this week
[2631.14 --> 2633.14]  Also for Amy Kron
[2633.14 --> 2635.84]  Who is dealing with this very tough disease
[2635.84 --> 2637.64]  Grant them your peace
[2637.64 --> 2640.22]  May your healing hand touch them
[2640.22 --> 2642.90]  And their bodies in such a powerful way
[2642.90 --> 2644.80]  And grant them the peace
[2644.80 --> 2646.42]  That transcends all understanding
[2646.42 --> 2649.44]  We pray for all the young people and leaders
[2649.44 --> 2651.16]  That are preparing for the trip to Mexico
[2651.16 --> 2654.00]  We thank you for a good evening last night
[2654.00 --> 2656.74]  And we pray that your grace and gifts
[2656.74 --> 2659.18]  May be evident as they minister in your name
[2659.18 --> 2662.38]  May each one receive power and wisdom
[2662.38 --> 2664.64]  Whatever may cross their path
[2664.64 --> 2665.98]  As they go there
[2665.98 --> 2669.06]  We ask that you would prepare our heart
[2669.06 --> 2670.46]  For Lord's Supper next week
[2670.46 --> 2672.82]  May we examine ourselves
[2672.82 --> 2675.66]  And if we need to ask our forgiveness
[2675.66 --> 2678.44]  May we do that with your grace
[2678.44 --> 2681.24]  We pray for our classes
[2681.24 --> 2682.44]  B.C. Southeast
[2682.44 --> 2685.14]  As they meet this week here in this church
[2685.14 --> 2687.38]  Grant wisdom to the delegates
[2687.38 --> 2690.40]  As they discuss the many areas of ministry
[2690.40 --> 2691.68]  In our classes
[2691.68 --> 2694.18]  Bless Pastor Chris
[2694.18 --> 2696.08]  As he leads us in the preaching of your word
[2696.08 --> 2697.44]  Found in Romans
[2697.44 --> 2699.64]  May our hearts be receptive
[2699.64 --> 2700.78]  And our minds renewed
[2700.78 --> 2703.32]  As we consider how faith can encourage
[2703.32 --> 2704.40]  Our walk with you
[2704.40 --> 2706.54]  We know that on our own
[2706.54 --> 2708.48]  We are unable to justify ourselves
[2708.48 --> 2711.14]  But rely totally on you
[2711.14 --> 2714.30]  This hymn expresses that so beautifully
[2714.30 --> 2715.70]  And clearly says
[2715.70 --> 2717.94]  Not what my hands have done
[2717.94 --> 2719.36]  Can save my guilty soul
[2719.36 --> 2721.98]  Not what my failing flesh has borne
[2721.98 --> 2723.32]  Can make my spirit whole
[2723.32 --> 2725.36]  Not what I say or do
[2725.36 --> 2726.92]  Can give me peace with God
[2726.92 --> 2729.82]  Not all my prayers and sighs and tears
[2729.82 --> 2731.64]  Can bear my awful load
[2731.64 --> 2734.30]  I bless the Christ of God
[2734.30 --> 2736.02]  I rest on love divine
[2736.02 --> 2738.52]  And with unfaltering lip and heart
[2738.52 --> 2740.16]  I call this Savior mine
[2740.16 --> 2743.68]  Tis he who saveth me
[2743.68 --> 2745.04]  And freely pardon gives
[2745.04 --> 2748.60]  I love because he loves
[2748.60 --> 2751.46]  I live because he lives
[2751.46 --> 2753.80]  We pray all these things
[2753.80 --> 2755.26]  In the name of our Lord and Savior
[2755.26 --> 2756.16]  Jesus Christ
[2756.16 --> 2756.92]  Amen
[2761.64 --> 2787.52]  We're going to start by reading together
[2787.52 --> 2793.22]  The first 17 verses of Romans 4
[2793.22 --> 2795.82]  And so if you have a Bible
[2795.82 --> 2797.04]  I encourage you to open that up
[2797.04 --> 2798.76]  If you use a device
[2798.76 --> 2799.80]  Get that out
[2799.80 --> 2800.98]  And get that ready
[2800.98 --> 2802.84]  It will be on the screen
[2802.84 --> 2805.16]  But after it leaves the screen
[2805.16 --> 2806.26]  We're going to stay there
[2806.26 --> 2810.08]  And near the end of our time together
[2810.08 --> 2811.56]  We're actually going to look at
[2811.56 --> 2813.48]  Verse 18 to the end
[2813.48 --> 2815.72]  And so I encourage you to have that
[2815.72 --> 2817.98]  In front of you as we go there
[2817.98 --> 2821.10]  So I'm going to read Romans 4
[2821.10 --> 2823.10]  The first 17 verses
[2823.10 --> 2829.00]  What then shall we say
[2829.00 --> 2831.44]  That Abraham, our forefather
[2831.44 --> 2832.66]  According to the flesh
[2832.66 --> 2834.42]  Discovered in this matter
[2834.42 --> 2838.72]  If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works
[2838.72 --> 2840.70]  He had something to boast about
[2840.70 --> 2842.66]  But not before God
[2842.66 --> 2844.62]  What does Scripture say?
[2844.62 --> 2846.14]  Abraham believed
[2846.14 --> 2848.02]  And it was credited to him
[2848.02 --> 2849.14]  As righteousness
[2849.14 --> 2852.78]  Now, to the one who works
[2852.78 --> 2855.52]  Wages are not credited as a gift
[2855.52 --> 2856.68]  But as an obligation
[2856.68 --> 2859.86]  However, to the one who does not work
[2859.86 --> 2861.00]  But trusts God
[2861.00 --> 2862.70]  Who justifies the ungodly
[2862.70 --> 2865.84]  Their faith is credited as righteousness
[2865.84 --> 2869.04]  David says the same thing
[2869.04 --> 2871.44]  When he speaks of the blessedness
[2871.44 --> 2873.28]  Of the one to whom God credits
[2873.28 --> 2875.22]  Righteousness apart from works
[2875.22 --> 2877.38]  Blessed are those
[2877.38 --> 2879.46]  Whose transgressions are forgiven
[2879.46 --> 2881.08]  Whose sins are covered
[2881.08 --> 2883.24]  Blessed is the one
[2883.24 --> 2884.62]  Whose sin the Lord
[2884.62 --> 2887.10]  Will never count against them
[2887.10 --> 2890.40]  Is this blessedness
[2890.40 --> 2892.28]  Only for the circumcised
[2892.28 --> 2894.34]  Or also for the uncircumcised?
[2895.38 --> 2897.02]  We have been saying
[2897.02 --> 2898.06]  That Abraham's faith
[2898.06 --> 2899.34]  Was credited to him
[2899.34 --> 2900.66]  As righteousness
[2900.66 --> 2903.16]  Under what circumstances
[2903.16 --> 2904.02]  Was it credited?
[2904.86 --> 2906.66]  Was it after he was circumcised
[2906.66 --> 2907.24]  Or before?
[2907.60 --> 2908.68]  It was not after
[2908.68 --> 2909.42]  But before
[2909.42 --> 2910.80]  And he received circumcision
[2910.80 --> 2911.62]  As a sign
[2911.62 --> 2913.46]  A seal of the righteousness
[2913.46 --> 2914.88]  That he had by faith
[2914.88 --> 2917.16]  While he was still uncircumcised
[2917.16 --> 2918.92]  So then
[2918.92 --> 2920.38]  He is the father
[2920.38 --> 2921.68]  Of all who believe
[2921.68 --> 2923.68]  But have not been circumcised
[2923.68 --> 2924.92]  In order that righteousness
[2924.92 --> 2926.70]  Might be credited to them
[2926.70 --> 2929.22]  And he is then
[2929.22 --> 2930.20]  Also the father
[2930.20 --> 2931.34]  Of the circumcised
[2931.34 --> 2932.90]  Who not only are circumcised
[2932.90 --> 2933.84]  But who also follow
[2933.84 --> 2934.70]  In the footsteps
[2934.70 --> 2935.58]  Of the faith
[2935.58 --> 2936.94]  That our father Abraham
[2936.94 --> 2938.00]  Had before
[2938.00 --> 2939.44]  He was circumcised
[2939.44 --> 2942.40]  It was not through the law
[2942.40 --> 2943.92]  That Abraham and his offspring
[2943.92 --> 2945.28]  Received promise
[2945.28 --> 2946.76]  That he would be heir
[2946.76 --> 2947.64]  Of the world
[2947.64 --> 2949.10]  But through the righteousness
[2949.10 --> 2951.18]  That comes by faith
[2951.18 --> 2953.62]  For if those who depend
[2953.62 --> 2954.86]  On the law are heirs
[2954.86 --> 2956.42]  Faith means nothing
[2956.42 --> 2957.88]  And the promise is worthless
[2957.88 --> 2960.32]  Because the law brings wrath
[2960.32 --> 2962.18]  And where there is no law
[2962.18 --> 2963.50]  There is no transgression
[2963.50 --> 2965.18]  Therefore
[2965.18 --> 2968.28]  The promise comes by faith
[2968.28 --> 2970.12]  So that it may be by grace
[2970.12 --> 2971.34]  And may be guaranteed
[2971.34 --> 2974.08]  To all Abraham's offspring
[2974.08 --> 2976.12]  Not only to those
[2976.12 --> 2977.02]  Who are of the law
[2977.02 --> 2978.04]  But also to those
[2978.04 --> 2979.02]  Who have the faith
[2979.02 --> 2980.04]  Of Abraham
[2980.04 --> 2982.90]  He is the father of us all
[2982.90 --> 2984.88]  As it is written
[2984.88 --> 2986.76]  I have made you a father
[2986.76 --> 2987.74]  Of many nations
[2987.74 --> 2989.94]  He is our father
[2989.94 --> 2991.00]  In the sight of God
[2991.00 --> 2992.30]  In whom he believed
[2992.30 --> 2994.20]  The God who gives life
[2994.20 --> 2994.82]  To the dead
[2994.82 --> 2996.66]  And calls into being
[2996.66 --> 2999.00]  Things that were not
[2999.00 --> 3001.38]  This is the word of the Lord
[3001.38 --> 3009.16]  So at the very beginning
[3009.16 --> 3011.66]  I want to acknowledge
[3011.66 --> 3015.56]  That one of the reasons
[3015.56 --> 3018.20]  Why you might not have heard
[3018.20 --> 3020.14]  A lot of preaching series
[3020.14 --> 3021.40]  In the book of Romans
[3021.40 --> 3022.94]  Is because Romans can be
[3022.94 --> 3024.30]  A hard book
[3024.30 --> 3025.24]  And it can be dense
[3025.24 --> 3026.84]  And it can be full of stuff
[3026.84 --> 3028.60]  And that this chapter
[3028.60 --> 3030.18]  And trying to follow
[3030.18 --> 3032.14]  Paul's line of thoughts
[3032.14 --> 3032.68]  Throughout
[3032.68 --> 3034.56]  Is one of those chapters
[3034.56 --> 3035.08]  Where you're like
[3035.08 --> 3035.38]  Yeah
[3035.38 --> 3036.70]  That's why
[3036.70 --> 3038.30]  We haven't heard this one a lot
[3038.30 --> 3038.84]  That's why
[3038.84 --> 3040.14]  When I do it in my devotions
[3040.14 --> 3041.36]  I read like six verses
[3041.36 --> 3041.90]  And I'm like
[3041.90 --> 3042.88]  I don't know what he's saying
[3042.88 --> 3043.96]  So I stop reading
[3043.96 --> 3046.84]  I want to acknowledge
[3046.84 --> 3046.98]  I want to acknowledge
[3046.98 --> 3050.16]  That I'm maybe asking
[3050.16 --> 3052.48]  A fair bit of your capacities
[3052.48 --> 3054.12]  For Sunday morning
[3054.12 --> 3055.18]  So I hope you had your coffee
[3055.18 --> 3056.08]  Or your tea
[3056.08 --> 3057.88]  Or whatever it is that you need
[3057.88 --> 3058.74]  A good night's sleep
[3058.74 --> 3061.84]  And we can dig in together
[3061.84 --> 3063.12]  This morning
[3063.12 --> 3065.18]  So morning
[3065.18 --> 3065.86]  I want to ask
[3065.86 --> 3067.04]  The question with you
[3067.04 --> 3068.20]  And hopefully
[3068.20 --> 3070.98]  Help us see well
[3070.98 --> 3073.12]  The answer to the question
[3073.12 --> 3076.64]  What is faith?
[3078.10 --> 3079.14]  I think this question
[3079.14 --> 3080.44]  Is really important
[3080.44 --> 3081.94]  And it really matters
[3081.94 --> 3083.08]  For us
[3083.08 --> 3084.56]  For a number of reasons
[3084.56 --> 3085.84]  We will see some of them
[3085.84 --> 3087.08]  But also because
[3087.08 --> 3088.92]  It's kind of confusing
[3088.92 --> 3089.54]  Right
[3089.54 --> 3090.66]  Even as a word
[3090.66 --> 3091.28]  Today
[3091.28 --> 3092.66]  What is faith
[3092.66 --> 3093.56]  Has sorts of
[3093.56 --> 3094.82]  Different meanings
[3094.82 --> 3095.24]  Right
[3095.24 --> 3096.32]  And in different contexts
[3096.32 --> 3097.92]  It means different things
[3097.92 --> 3099.54]  Sometimes we use
[3099.54 --> 3100.62]  The word faith
[3100.62 --> 3102.50]  To refer to
[3102.50 --> 3104.36]  Various religious
[3104.36 --> 3105.96]  Ideas
[3105.96 --> 3107.82]  Or groups of ideas
[3107.82 --> 3108.68]  Right
[3108.68 --> 3109.28]  And the Bible
[3109.28 --> 3110.38]  Actually uses the word
[3110.38 --> 3111.36]  Faith like this too
[3111.36 --> 3112.40]  When it talks about
[3112.40 --> 3113.28]  The faith
[3113.28 --> 3114.36]  Right
[3114.36 --> 3115.06]  So for instance
[3115.06 --> 3115.88]  In Jude
[3115.88 --> 3117.18]  You can read
[3117.18 --> 3118.34]  I urge you
[3118.34 --> 3119.58]  To contend for
[3119.58 --> 3120.56]  The faith
[3120.56 --> 3121.90]  Once for all
[3121.90 --> 3123.24]  Entrusted to God's
[3123.24 --> 3124.18]  Holy people
[3124.18 --> 3126.10]  What he means there
[3126.10 --> 3128.10]  Is the set of beliefs
[3128.10 --> 3130.12]  The system of doctrine
[3130.12 --> 3131.84]  The truths of what it means
[3131.84 --> 3133.06]  To be Christian
[3133.06 --> 3134.02]  And who God is
[3134.02 --> 3135.18]  And what Jesus has accomplished
[3135.18 --> 3136.56]  And where the world
[3136.56 --> 3137.16]  Is going
[3137.16 --> 3138.52]  In light of all of that
[3138.52 --> 3138.72]  Right
[3138.72 --> 3139.82]  The faith
[3139.82 --> 3141.56]  Refers to that big system
[3141.56 --> 3142.64]  And set
[3142.64 --> 3145.02]  Now in Jude
[3145.02 --> 3146.08]  The faith
[3146.08 --> 3147.52]  Refers to
[3147.52 --> 3148.54]  What we would call
[3148.54 --> 3149.78]  The Christian religion
[3149.78 --> 3151.20]  But in our world
[3151.20 --> 3152.08]  Sometimes we use
[3152.08 --> 3152.84]  The word faith
[3152.84 --> 3154.02]  Or faiths
[3154.02 --> 3155.32]  To refer to
[3155.32 --> 3156.82]  Other religions
[3156.82 --> 3157.46]  As well
[3157.46 --> 3159.66]  The Bible never does that
[3159.66 --> 3160.60]  The Bible never refers
[3160.60 --> 3162.36]  To other religious ideas
[3162.36 --> 3164.04]  As a faith of a kind
[3164.04 --> 3165.32]  It only ever calls them
[3165.32 --> 3166.16]  Idolatries
[3166.16 --> 3167.44]  Or adulteries
[3167.44 --> 3169.10]  But in our world
[3169.10 --> 3170.22]  That's one way
[3170.22 --> 3170.90]  We use faith
[3170.90 --> 3173.04]  Another way
[3173.04 --> 3174.00]  That we use faith
[3174.00 --> 3175.14]  Or talk about faith
[3175.14 --> 3176.12]  In the world today
[3176.12 --> 3177.60]  Is this idea
[3177.60 --> 3178.88]  That if
[3178.88 --> 3180.20]  I believe
[3180.20 --> 3181.48]  Really hard
[3181.48 --> 3182.94]  With the right
[3182.94 --> 3183.92]  Measure of
[3183.92 --> 3184.76]  Intensity
[3184.76 --> 3187.22]  I will be able to
[3187.22 --> 3188.08]  In a sense
[3188.08 --> 3189.52]  Wrestle gifts
[3189.52 --> 3190.42]  From God
[3190.42 --> 3192.76]  Right
[3192.76 --> 3192.96]  And
[3192.96 --> 3194.56]  Some of you
[3194.56 --> 3195.44]  Might have heard
[3195.44 --> 3196.62]  Or might have thought
[3196.62 --> 3197.36]  Right
[3197.36 --> 3199.40]  If I have enough faith
[3199.40 --> 3201.78]  God will give me that job
[3201.78 --> 3204.58]  If I have enough faith
[3204.58 --> 3206.22]  God will heal my mom
[3206.22 --> 3207.38]  Of her cancer
[3207.38 --> 3209.30]  In fact
[3209.30 --> 3211.32]  I have heard
[3211.32 --> 3212.42]  What I could only pray
[3212.42 --> 3213.04]  And trust
[3213.04 --> 3214.36]  Are well-meaning Christians
[3214.36 --> 3215.70]  Say to people
[3215.70 --> 3216.12]  Who are
[3216.12 --> 3217.02]  Mourning
[3217.02 --> 3217.98]  A diagnosis
[3217.98 --> 3220.00]  Of a terminal illness
[3220.00 --> 3221.66]  If you have enough faith
[3221.66 --> 3222.74]  God will heal you
[3222.74 --> 3225.90]  That's awful
[3225.90 --> 3226.90]  Language
[3226.90 --> 3227.96]  To use
[3227.96 --> 3228.76]  It borders on
[3228.76 --> 3229.70]  Spiritually abusive
[3229.70 --> 3230.12]  Really
[3230.12 --> 3231.74]  But that's one of the ways
[3231.74 --> 3233.12]  That we talk about faith
[3233.12 --> 3233.56]  Right
[3233.56 --> 3234.64]  That if we have enough of it
[3234.64 --> 3236.10]  If we believe hard enough
[3236.10 --> 3237.58]  God will give us what we want
[3237.58 --> 3239.84]  Or give us what we think we need
[3239.84 --> 3242.30]  Another way
[3242.30 --> 3243.38]  That we talk about faith
[3243.38 --> 3244.86]  In the world
[3244.86 --> 3246.66]  Refers to
[3246.66 --> 3247.70]  Faith
[3247.70 --> 3249.28]  Kind of as a
[3249.28 --> 3250.40]  A mere
[3250.40 --> 3251.18]  Religious
[3251.18 --> 3252.16]  Preference
[3252.16 --> 3253.86]  And in some sense
[3253.86 --> 3255.34]  I'm making a contrast here
[3255.34 --> 3256.84]  Between what some people
[3256.84 --> 3258.08]  Might call a fact
[3258.08 --> 3259.82]  And what some people
[3259.82 --> 3261.22]  Might call faith
[3261.22 --> 3261.70]  Right
[3261.70 --> 3263.16]  And so in the category of facts
[3263.16 --> 3264.76]  You have things like gravity
[3264.76 --> 3265.38]  Right
[3265.38 --> 3266.56]  Gravity exists
[3266.56 --> 3267.86]  It moves at
[3267.86 --> 3269.42]  Ken you can help me with this
[3269.42 --> 3271.58]  Negative 9.8 meters per second squared
[3271.58 --> 3274.12]  Oh Glenn said yes
[3274.12 --> 3274.94]  Ken you were too slow
[3274.94 --> 3276.02]  Right
[3276.02 --> 3278.98]  Gravity is a fixed law
[3278.98 --> 3279.48]  Right
[3279.48 --> 3280.62]  That is a fact
[3280.62 --> 3282.42]  And then in this other category
[3282.42 --> 3283.54]  Of things
[3283.54 --> 3283.92]  Right
[3283.92 --> 3285.06]  Like between choosing
[3285.06 --> 3286.30]  Between one faith
[3286.30 --> 3287.64]  Or one religious system
[3287.64 --> 3288.64]  Or another
[3288.64 --> 3289.44]  Right
[3289.44 --> 3290.68]  We have faith
[3290.68 --> 3291.84]  And so there's this contrast
[3291.84 --> 3293.26]  That exists between facts
[3293.26 --> 3294.84]  And faith
[3294.84 --> 3295.98]  Between sometimes
[3295.98 --> 3296.80]  It's put knowledge
[3296.80 --> 3298.36]  And belief
[3298.36 --> 3298.86]  Right
[3298.86 --> 3299.54]  And that's one of the ways
[3299.54 --> 3301.06]  That we use faith
[3301.06 --> 3302.14]  And in that way
[3302.14 --> 3303.66]  Faith
[3303.66 --> 3304.54]  Religious faith
[3304.54 --> 3305.14]  Becomes
[3305.14 --> 3306.38]  In some sense
[3306.38 --> 3307.64]  A leap
[3307.64 --> 3309.02]  Beyond
[3309.02 --> 3310.02]  Reason
[3310.02 --> 3312.02]  A leap
[3312.02 --> 3312.76]  Beyond
[3312.76 --> 3313.60]  What is
[3313.60 --> 3314.50]  Rational
[3314.50 --> 3316.74]  Right
[3316.74 --> 3317.66]  Those are some of the ways
[3317.66 --> 3318.62]  That we use the word faith
[3318.62 --> 3319.16]  And that's to say
[3319.16 --> 3320.12]  Nothing of how we use it
[3320.12 --> 3321.36]  Sort of in common parlance
[3321.36 --> 3321.60]  Right
[3321.60 --> 3322.46]  About participating
[3322.46 --> 3323.92]  In a conversation
[3323.92 --> 3325.06]  In good faith
[3325.06 --> 3326.36]  Right
[3326.36 --> 3326.78]  So that means
[3326.78 --> 3328.18]  With the hoped for
[3328.18 --> 3328.68]  Something
[3328.68 --> 3329.40]  And outcome
[3329.40 --> 3333.02]  Are any of those
[3333.02 --> 3334.84]  What the Bible means
[3334.84 --> 3336.20]  When it talks about
[3336.20 --> 3337.08]  Faith
[3337.08 --> 3338.72]  And if not
[3338.72 --> 3340.20]  What does the Bible mean
[3340.20 --> 3341.38]  When we ask the question
[3341.38 --> 3343.04]  What is faith
[3343.04 --> 3346.90]  Christian faith
[3346.90 --> 3348.94]  Always
[3348.94 --> 3350.96]  Has an object
[3350.96 --> 3352.28]  Kevin made this point
[3352.28 --> 3353.36]  Beautifully last week
[3353.36 --> 3354.20]  If you weren't here
[3354.20 --> 3355.72]  I encourage you to go online
[3355.72 --> 3356.62]  And check that out
[3356.62 --> 3358.18]  It's one of his
[3358.18 --> 3359.54]  Top five sermons
[3359.54 --> 3363.22]  I'll say that every time
[3363.22 --> 3363.78]  From now on
[3363.78 --> 3367.96]  That faith is
[3367.96 --> 3368.82]  In the Bible
[3368.82 --> 3370.70]  In the first place
[3370.70 --> 3372.88]  Not about your intensity
[3372.88 --> 3374.02]  Of feeling
[3374.02 --> 3376.26]  But about the object
[3376.26 --> 3377.78]  It rests upon
[3377.78 --> 3378.40]  Right
[3378.40 --> 3380.02]  Faith is only valid
[3380.02 --> 3380.96]  In so far
[3380.96 --> 3382.04]  As the object
[3382.04 --> 3382.98]  Of your faith
[3382.98 --> 3383.56]  Is valid
[3383.56 --> 3385.64]  Let me give you an example
[3385.64 --> 3388.32]  I might have
[3388.32 --> 3389.88]  The strongest faith
[3389.88 --> 3390.80]  Right
[3390.80 --> 3392.96]  A super intense faith
[3392.96 --> 3394.40]  That I have
[3394.40 --> 3395.96]  The best hair
[3395.96 --> 3397.28]  In this church
[3397.28 --> 3398.68]  In fact
[3398.68 --> 3399.82]  I got it trimmed yesterday
[3399.82 --> 3401.18]  Just to make this point
[3401.18 --> 3402.14]  Even more explicitly
[3402.14 --> 3403.26]  Right
[3403.26 --> 3404.84]  And I can argue with you
[3404.84 --> 3406.78]  Until you're blue in the face
[3406.78 --> 3408.56]  That my hair is the best
[3408.56 --> 3412.80]  But then you're going to look at
[3412.80 --> 3413.70]  Levi Huberts
[3413.70 --> 3413.94]  And go
[3413.94 --> 3414.24]  No
[3414.24 --> 3416.50]  His is the best
[3416.50 --> 3418.70]  Right
[3418.70 --> 3419.56]  My intensity
[3419.56 --> 3420.68]  Doesn't matter
[3420.68 --> 3421.88]  Right
[3421.88 --> 3422.66]  My passion
[3422.66 --> 3423.48]  For how true
[3423.48 --> 3424.24]  It might be
[3424.24 --> 3425.66]  Doesn't make up
[3425.66 --> 3426.84]  For the truth
[3426.84 --> 3429.12]  Of my receding hairline
[3429.12 --> 3430.56]  And my thinning widow's peak
[3430.56 --> 3432.70]  I'm just going to own it
[3432.70 --> 3434.88]  Right
[3434.88 --> 3436.46]  It's a demonstrable fact
[3436.46 --> 3438.06]  That Levi's
[3438.06 --> 3439.64]  Unruly mop of hair
[3439.64 --> 3441.00]  Is much cooler than mine
[3441.00 --> 3442.90]  If you don't know
[3442.90 --> 3443.74]  Who I'm talking about
[3443.74 --> 3444.78]  You'll see him afterwards
[3444.78 --> 3446.50]  Everyone will be touching his head
[3446.50 --> 3448.74]  Don't actually do that
[3448.74 --> 3453.24]  And let me just say
[3453.24 --> 3453.90]  For now
[3453.90 --> 3454.24]  Okay
[3454.24 --> 3455.82]  Look at your dad's hairline
[3455.82 --> 3456.64]  For now
[3456.64 --> 3463.02]  The Christian faith
[3463.02 --> 3463.90]  Right
[3463.90 --> 3465.22]  The Christian faith
[3465.22 --> 3467.40]  Has as its object
[3467.40 --> 3470.20]  The person of Jesus Christ
[3470.20 --> 3473.02]  And the promise of the gospel
[3473.02 --> 3475.04]  The Christian faith
[3475.04 --> 3476.24]  Is focused upon
[3476.24 --> 3477.22]  The truth
[3477.22 --> 3479.22]  That in history
[3479.22 --> 3481.34]  Really and actually
[3481.34 --> 3483.18]  God took on flesh
[3483.18 --> 3484.48]  And made his dwelling
[3484.48 --> 3485.52]  Among us
[3485.52 --> 3486.34]  That Jesus
[3486.34 --> 3487.38]  Was really
[3487.38 --> 3488.58]  And actually
[3488.58 --> 3490.52]  Born of a virgin
[3490.52 --> 3492.10]  According to the scriptures
[3492.10 --> 3493.28]  That he really
[3493.28 --> 3494.44]  And actually
[3494.44 --> 3495.92]  Lived a life
[3495.92 --> 3497.26]  Of perfect righteousness
[3497.26 --> 3498.18]  And submission
[3498.18 --> 3499.84]  To God the Father
[3499.84 --> 3500.40]  Again
[3500.40 --> 3502.30]  According to the scriptures
[3502.30 --> 3502.68]  Right
[3502.68 --> 3504.06]  That is doing exactly
[3504.06 --> 3504.98]  What God promised
[3504.98 --> 3505.78]  He would do
[3505.78 --> 3507.36]  From the book of Genesis
[3507.36 --> 3508.12]  All the way through
[3508.12 --> 3508.94]  To Malachi
[3508.94 --> 3509.76]  In anticipation
[3509.76 --> 3511.94]  Of this coming savior
[3511.94 --> 3513.32]  That Jesus Christ
[3513.32 --> 3514.66]  Really and actually
[3514.66 --> 3515.56]  Died the death
[3515.56 --> 3516.66]  That we all deserve
[3516.66 --> 3517.82]  As the wrath of God
[3517.82 --> 3518.90]  For human sin
[3518.90 --> 3519.34]  Right
[3519.34 --> 3520.06]  This is the journey
[3520.06 --> 3520.94]  That we have been on
[3520.94 --> 3521.84]  In the book of Romans
[3521.84 --> 3523.88]  By his wounds
[3523.88 --> 3525.46]  We are healed
[3525.46 --> 3526.12]  The punishment
[3526.12 --> 3527.32]  That brought us peace
[3527.32 --> 3528.96]  Was on his shoulders
[3528.96 --> 3531.80]  And that three days later
[3531.80 --> 3533.08]  Really and actually
[3533.08 --> 3534.62]  God raised him
[3534.62 --> 3535.48]  From the dead
[3535.48 --> 3537.40]  Victorious over sin
[3537.40 --> 3538.24]  And death
[3538.24 --> 3539.98]  Let me be clear
[3539.98 --> 3541.00]  That this last part
[3541.00 --> 3542.70]  Really matters for us
[3542.70 --> 3542.90]  Right
[3542.90 --> 3543.78]  Paul says
[3543.78 --> 3546.42]  In 1 Corinthians 15
[3546.42 --> 3547.58]  That if Jesus
[3547.58 --> 3548.82]  Has not been raised
[3548.82 --> 3550.10]  We Christians
[3550.10 --> 3551.40]  Are most of all
[3551.40 --> 3552.08]  To be pitied
[3552.08 --> 3553.36]  Because we are
[3553.36 --> 3554.40]  Believing a lie
[3554.40 --> 3555.30]  And if Jesus
[3555.30 --> 3556.26]  Hasn't been raised
[3556.26 --> 3557.26]  There's still
[3557.26 --> 3558.54]  We are still
[3558.54 --> 3560.12]  Stuck in our sin
[3560.12 --> 3561.96]  The resurrection
[3561.96 --> 3562.58]  Of Jesus
[3562.58 --> 3564.02]  Is the hinge
[3564.02 --> 3564.42]  On
[3564.42 --> 3565.32]  The hinge
[3565.32 --> 3566.00]  Of history
[3566.00 --> 3566.58]  On which
[3566.58 --> 3567.30]  Everything
[3567.30 --> 3568.26]  Turns
[3568.26 --> 3569.66]  Now I know
[3569.66 --> 3571.68]  That your calendars
[3571.68 --> 3572.12]  And the way
[3572.12 --> 3572.90]  That up until
[3572.90 --> 3573.50]  Very recently
[3573.50 --> 3574.22]  We have counted
[3574.22 --> 3574.70]  Dates
[3574.70 --> 3575.60]  Might indicate
[3575.60 --> 3576.22]  That the first
[3576.22 --> 3576.70]  Christmas
[3576.70 --> 3577.08]  Right
[3577.08 --> 3577.96]  The first coming
[3577.96 --> 3578.52]  Of Jesus
[3578.52 --> 3580.02]  The before Christ
[3580.02 --> 3581.52]  To year of our Lord
[3581.52 --> 3582.60]  B.C. to A.D.
[3582.72 --> 3585.02]  Or before common era
[3585.02 --> 3585.78]  It's a common era
[3585.78 --> 3586.60]  That that might be
[3586.60 --> 3587.60]  The hinge of history
[3587.60 --> 3588.66]  But I believe
[3588.66 --> 3589.44]  And I think the Bible
[3589.44 --> 3590.16]  Affirms
[3590.16 --> 3591.36]  That what changes
[3591.36 --> 3593.24]  Everything for everyone
[3593.24 --> 3594.94]  Is the resurrection
[3594.94 --> 3595.60]  Of Jesus
[3595.60 --> 3599.60]  Faith has as its object
[3599.60 --> 3600.64]  The person
[3600.64 --> 3601.84]  Of Jesus Christ
[3601.84 --> 3602.78]  And the promise
[3602.78 --> 3604.04]  Of the gospel
[3604.04 --> 3605.90]  And with the resurrection
[3605.90 --> 3607.10]  The promise
[3607.10 --> 3608.12]  Of the gospel
[3608.12 --> 3609.30]  Is a guarantee
[3609.30 --> 3611.40]  For all who believe
[3611.40 --> 3613.86]  And that you see
[3613.86 --> 3615.30]  Is why getting faith
[3615.30 --> 3615.72]  Right
[3615.72 --> 3616.56]  Or understanding
[3616.56 --> 3617.38]  It correctly
[3617.38 --> 3618.78]  Is so important
[3618.78 --> 3619.82]  For Paul
[3619.82 --> 3620.60]  At this point
[3620.60 --> 3621.46]  In his letter
[3621.46 --> 3622.40]  To the Romans
[3622.40 --> 3623.44]  And that's why
[3623.44 --> 3624.98]  He uses an example
[3624.98 --> 3626.48]  Here in Romans 4
[3626.48 --> 3628.52]  Of the person
[3628.52 --> 3629.04]  And story
[3629.04 --> 3629.66]  Of Abraham
[3629.66 --> 3631.06]  And of David
[3631.06 --> 3633.04]  Now we don't have time
[3633.04 --> 3633.46]  This morning
[3633.46 --> 3634.08]  To get into
[3634.08 --> 3636.12]  All the particular details
[3636.12 --> 3636.68]  But the story
[3636.68 --> 3637.06]  Of Abraham
[3637.06 --> 3638.12]  Is a fascinating one
[3638.12 --> 3638.80]  In your Bibles
[3638.80 --> 3639.50]  If you turn to
[3639.50 --> 3640.26]  The first book
[3640.26 --> 3641.76]  Start at Genesis 12
[3641.76 --> 3642.98]  And just keep reading
[3642.98 --> 3644.34]  Until Abraham
[3644.34 --> 3645.14]  Is moved on
[3645.14 --> 3645.96]  But Genesis 12
[3645.96 --> 3647.10]  Especially through
[3647.10 --> 3648.34]  Genesis 22
[3648.34 --> 3650.06]  Beautiful story
[3650.06 --> 3651.38]  About Abraham's
[3651.38 --> 3653.24]  Faith and response
[3653.24 --> 3653.96]  To God's
[3653.96 --> 3655.28]  Leading to him
[3655.28 --> 3656.38]  And Abraham
[3656.38 --> 3658.36]  Is the father
[3658.36 --> 3660.28]  Of the Hebrews
[3660.28 --> 3661.58]  He's the founder
[3661.58 --> 3663.34]  Of the Jewish faith
[3663.34 --> 3664.66]  And for those
[3664.66 --> 3665.76]  In Paul's audience
[3665.76 --> 3667.20]  Who connect back
[3667.20 --> 3668.62]  To this faith
[3668.62 --> 3670.92]  As sourcing
[3670.92 --> 3672.10]  What they now believe
[3672.10 --> 3672.36]  Right
[3672.36 --> 3673.22]  His argument
[3673.22 --> 3674.84]  About Abraham
[3674.84 --> 3676.40]  Then makes it
[3676.40 --> 3676.86]  Sort of
[3676.86 --> 3678.30]  Comprehensively
[3678.30 --> 3679.22]  Applicable
[3679.22 --> 3681.30]  And likewise
[3681.30 --> 3682.44]  The reference
[3682.44 --> 3683.04]  To David
[3683.04 --> 3683.52]  Right
[3683.52 --> 3684.38]  David is the
[3684.38 --> 3684.96]  Sort of
[3684.96 --> 3685.72]  Prototypical
[3685.72 --> 3686.92]  Or archetypical
[3686.92 --> 3687.42]  King
[3687.42 --> 3688.70]  In the Hebrew
[3688.70 --> 3689.44]  Mindset
[3689.44 --> 3690.60]  He is the standard
[3690.60 --> 3691.34]  By which all
[3691.34 --> 3692.04]  Other kings
[3692.04 --> 3693.04]  Are judged
[3693.04 --> 3694.02]  Because as the
[3694.02 --> 3694.84]  Bible says
[3694.84 --> 3696.84]  David is a man
[3696.84 --> 3697.58]  After God's
[3697.58 --> 3698.66]  Own heart
[3698.66 --> 3700.28]  And so in
[3700.28 --> 3701.40]  Abraham and David
[3701.40 --> 3702.22]  You have both
[3702.22 --> 3703.58]  The ethnic
[3703.58 --> 3704.38]  Source
[3704.38 --> 3705.18]  And the
[3705.18 --> 3705.96]  Monarchical
[3705.96 --> 3706.86]  Example
[3706.86 --> 3707.98]  Of why God
[3707.98 --> 3709.24]  Chose Israel
[3709.24 --> 3710.30]  Or at least
[3710.30 --> 3712.46]  That's the thinking
[3712.46 --> 3712.98]  Of the Jews
[3712.98 --> 3713.44]  Of the day
[3713.44 --> 3715.94]  Now
[3715.94 --> 3717.24]  Again
[3717.24 --> 3717.70]  With Bibles
[3717.70 --> 3718.10]  Open
[3718.10 --> 3719.46]  In chapter 3
[3719.46 --> 3720.00]  So we read
[3720.00 --> 3720.60]  Chapter 4
[3720.60 --> 3721.14]  So this is a
[3721.14 --> 3721.58]  Couple verses
[3721.58 --> 3721.96]  Before
[3721.96 --> 3722.78]  Chapter 3
[3722.78 --> 3723.70]  Verse 27
[3723.70 --> 3726.64]  Paul writes
[3726.64 --> 3728.28]  Where then
[3728.28 --> 3729.54]  Is boasting
[3729.54 --> 3731.14]  It is excluded
[3731.14 --> 3732.32]  Because of the law
[3732.32 --> 3733.62]  The law that requires
[3733.62 --> 3734.08]  Works
[3734.08 --> 3734.88]  No
[3734.88 --> 3736.26]  Because of the law
[3736.26 --> 3737.00]  That requires
[3737.00 --> 3738.04]  Faith
[3738.04 --> 3740.40]  Now in some ways
[3740.40 --> 3741.88]  Chapter 4
[3741.88 --> 3743.88]  Is an example
[3743.88 --> 3745.56]  To make the point
[3745.56 --> 3746.54]  That Paul
[3746.54 --> 3747.18]  Is making
[3747.18 --> 3748.22]  In verse 27
[3748.22 --> 3749.34]  Through 31
[3749.34 --> 3750.18]  Right
[3750.18 --> 3751.04]  Look at chapter 4
[3751.04 --> 3751.54]  Verse 2
[3751.54 --> 3752.84]  You heard that verse
[3752.84 --> 3753.94]  Where then is boasting
[3753.94 --> 3754.76]  In 27
[3754.76 --> 3755.80]  Verse 2
[3755.80 --> 3756.12]  Now
[3756.12 --> 3757.10]  If in fact
[3757.10 --> 3758.32]  Abraham was justified
[3758.32 --> 3759.00]  By works
[3759.00 --> 3760.00]  He had something
[3760.00 --> 3761.50]  To boast
[3761.50 --> 3762.50]  About
[3762.50 --> 3764.28]  You see the tie
[3764.28 --> 3766.68]  But not before God
[3766.68 --> 3767.84]  Paul says
[3767.84 --> 3768.54]  And then Paul then
[3768.54 --> 3769.16]  Quotes from
[3769.16 --> 3770.36]  Genesis 15
[3770.36 --> 3771.44]  Verse 6
[3771.44 --> 3772.56]  And then that same line
[3772.56 --> 3773.70]  Is repeated in 15
[3773.70 --> 3774.38]  Verse 22
[3774.38 --> 3774.90]  Saying
[3774.90 --> 3776.92]  Abraham believed God
[3776.92 --> 3778.04]  And it was credited
[3778.04 --> 3778.90]  To him
[3778.90 --> 3780.30]  As righteousness
[3780.30 --> 3782.56]  Now that line
[3782.56 --> 3785.40]  Introduces for us
[3785.40 --> 3786.24]  The theme
[3786.24 --> 3788.18]  Of this whole example
[3788.18 --> 3789.40]  And the theme
[3789.40 --> 3790.82]  Of what faith
[3790.82 --> 3793.34]  Is and does
[3793.34 --> 3795.30]  And it's based
[3795.30 --> 3795.84]  On the word
[3795.84 --> 3796.58]  That's used there
[3796.58 --> 3797.62]  Credited
[3797.62 --> 3800.42]  That word credited
[3800.42 --> 3801.92]  Is a Greek word
[3801.92 --> 3802.72]  That's used
[3802.72 --> 3804.02]  11 times
[3804.02 --> 3805.02]  In this chapter
[3805.02 --> 3806.90]  To put that in context
[3806.90 --> 3808.24]  The word is used
[3808.24 --> 3809.36]  39 times
[3809.36 --> 3810.14]  In the New Testament
[3810.14 --> 3812.42]  And 11 of those times
[3812.42 --> 3813.40]  Are in these
[3813.40 --> 3814.76]  What is it
[3814.76 --> 3815.74]  24
[3815.74 --> 3818.00]  25 verses
[3818.00 --> 3819.30]  So the vast
[3819.30 --> 3820.00]  Preponderance
[3820.00 --> 3820.36]  Of them
[3820.36 --> 3821.28]  Is right here
[3821.28 --> 3822.16]  And so it matters
[3822.16 --> 3822.76]  For what Paul
[3822.76 --> 3823.72]  Is trying to communicate
[3823.72 --> 3824.74]  Right here
[3824.74 --> 3825.64]  And right now
[3825.64 --> 3828.82]  It's a word
[3828.82 --> 3829.46]  That has been
[3829.46 --> 3829.96]  Translated
[3829.96 --> 3830.96]  In our text
[3830.96 --> 3831.60]  As credited
[3831.60 --> 3833.88]  Or as count
[3833.88 --> 3836.74]  Count is in verse 8
[3836.74 --> 3838.04]  Whose sin the Lord
[3838.04 --> 3838.80]  Will never count
[3838.80 --> 3839.50]  Against them
[3839.50 --> 3840.24]  Same word
[3840.24 --> 3842.68]  And it's a term
[3842.68 --> 3844.12]  That's actually used
[3844.12 --> 3845.36]  In the accounting world
[3845.36 --> 3845.98]  Right
[3845.98 --> 3847.14]  In the world of finance
[3847.14 --> 3849.32]  In the Greco-Roman
[3849.32 --> 3850.38]  Language
[3850.38 --> 3851.56]  And culture
[3851.56 --> 3852.88]  And it's a term
[3852.88 --> 3853.44]  That means
[3853.44 --> 3854.88]  To count as
[3854.88 --> 3856.14]  And so
[3856.14 --> 3857.66]  To credit something
[3857.66 --> 3859.46]  Is to confer
[3859.46 --> 3861.30]  A status onto it
[3861.30 --> 3862.42]  That was not there
[3862.42 --> 3862.82]  Before
[3862.82 --> 3865.78]  So when Paul
[3865.78 --> 3866.46]  Talks about
[3866.46 --> 3867.94]  Abraham's faith
[3867.94 --> 3868.78]  Being credited
[3868.78 --> 3869.70]  To him as
[3869.70 --> 3870.60]  Righteousness
[3870.60 --> 3871.74]  What does that mean?
[3873.18 --> 3874.16]  It's not that
[3874.16 --> 3875.40]  Faith results
[3875.40 --> 3876.46]  In righteousness
[3876.46 --> 3878.10]  Though it's true
[3878.10 --> 3879.12]  That if we believe
[3879.12 --> 3879.98]  That God exists
[3879.98 --> 3881.32]  And that he deserves
[3881.32 --> 3882.18]  Our obedience
[3882.18 --> 3883.04]  And our worship
[3883.04 --> 3883.72]  Then out of that
[3883.72 --> 3884.96]  Will flow a certain
[3884.96 --> 3886.78]  Kind of righteous living
[3886.78 --> 3889.30]  But it's also not true
[3889.30 --> 3890.98]  That Abraham's faith
[3890.98 --> 3892.38]  Faith is somehow
[3892.38 --> 3893.58]  In and of itself
[3893.58 --> 3895.10]  A form of righteousness
[3895.10 --> 3895.48]  Right?
[3895.54 --> 3896.36]  Where then it merits
[3896.36 --> 3897.18]  Or deserves
[3897.18 --> 3898.54]  And earns
[3898.54 --> 3899.38]  God's favor
[3899.38 --> 3900.24]  And blessing
[3900.24 --> 3903.38]  What Paul is saying here
[3903.38 --> 3904.94]  What Genesis is saying
[3904.94 --> 3905.78]  Before that
[3905.78 --> 3907.84]  Is that Abraham's faith
[3907.84 --> 3909.32]  His believing
[3909.32 --> 3912.80]  Counted as righteousness
[3912.80 --> 3913.88]  It means that God
[3913.88 --> 3914.96]  Treated Abraham
[3914.96 --> 3916.70]  As though he was
[3916.70 --> 3918.18]  Living a righteous life
[3918.18 --> 3920.04]  His faith was not
[3920.04 --> 3920.66]  His righteousness
[3920.66 --> 3922.26]  But God counted it
[3922.26 --> 3923.92]  As if it were
[3923.92 --> 3925.56]  Did you hear that?
[3925.62 --> 3926.10]  Because that's the
[3926.10 --> 3926.92]  Really important
[3926.92 --> 3928.72]  Theological distinction
[3928.72 --> 3930.00]  Right?
[3930.04 --> 3931.14]  It's the really important part
[3931.14 --> 3931.70]  Of what
[3931.70 --> 3933.50]  Understanding the question
[3933.50 --> 3934.18]  And answer
[3934.18 --> 3935.64]  What is faith?
[3936.64 --> 3936.78]  Right?
[3936.78 --> 3937.82]  Abraham himself
[3937.82 --> 3939.34]  Is not righteous
[3939.34 --> 3940.24]  Or perfect
[3940.24 --> 3941.24]  Or blameless
[3941.24 --> 3942.12]  But God
[3942.12 --> 3943.36]  Treated him
[3943.36 --> 3944.72]  As though he were
[3944.72 --> 3946.44]  And why did God
[3946.44 --> 3947.24]  Treat him that way?
[3947.78 --> 3949.04]  Because he had faith
[3949.04 --> 3950.94]  Because he believed
[3950.94 --> 3952.68]  And again
[3952.68 --> 3953.96]  Believing
[3953.96 --> 3955.50]  Having faith
[3955.50 --> 3956.60]  Doesn't make him
[3956.60 --> 3957.28]  Perfect
[3957.28 --> 3958.32]  Right?
[3958.36 --> 3959.34]  He's still a sinner
[3959.34 --> 3959.62]  Again
[3959.62 --> 3960.66]  Read the story
[3960.66 --> 3961.10]  Of Abraham
[3961.10 --> 3962.26]  After Genesis 15
[3962.26 --> 3963.36]  He doesn't
[3963.36 --> 3964.56]  Come across
[3964.56 --> 3965.34]  Excellently
[3965.34 --> 3965.90]  Read the story
[3965.90 --> 3966.52]  Of David
[3966.52 --> 3967.86]  A man after God's own heart
[3967.86 --> 3968.60]  He definitely
[3968.60 --> 3969.68]  Doesn't come across
[3969.68 --> 3970.68]  Excellently
[3970.68 --> 3972.42]  But these are the examples
[3972.42 --> 3973.06]  Right?
[3973.12 --> 3974.70]  You are still a sinner
[3974.70 --> 3976.24]  Even though you believe
[3976.24 --> 3977.60]  Right?
[3977.62 --> 3978.72]  You are still sinful
[3978.72 --> 3980.10]  Even though
[3980.10 --> 3981.38]  You are declared
[3981.38 --> 3982.40]  Righteous
[3982.40 --> 3985.48]  In the
[3985.48 --> 3986.86]  In the Reformation
[3986.86 --> 3989.56]  Back in the 16th century
[3989.56 --> 3990.64]  There was a phrase
[3990.64 --> 3991.40]  That was used
[3991.40 --> 3992.22]  By the Reformers
[3992.22 --> 3993.98]  It's a Latin phrase
[3993.98 --> 3995.24]  So it might not sound
[3995.24 --> 3996.66]  Familiar to you
[3996.66 --> 3997.36]  And I'll do my best
[3997.36 --> 3998.04]  To pronounce it
[3998.04 --> 3998.92]  But it is key
[3998.92 --> 4000.14]  For our understanding
[4000.14 --> 4000.92]  Of what's happening
[4000.92 --> 4001.58]  Here
[4001.58 --> 4003.08]  That phrase
[4003.08 --> 4004.30]  Is simul
[4004.30 --> 4005.08]  Eustis
[4005.08 --> 4005.58]  Ecc
[4005.58 --> 4006.48]  Peccator
[4006.48 --> 4008.58]  Simul
[4008.58 --> 4009.08]  Eustis
[4009.08 --> 4009.32]  Ecc
[4009.32 --> 4009.96]  Peccator
[4009.96 --> 4011.62]  Simultaneously
[4011.62 --> 4013.04]  Righteous
[4013.04 --> 4014.90]  Or just
[4014.90 --> 4017.10]  And sinful
[4017.10 --> 4021.14]  You are simultaneously
[4021.14 --> 4022.06]  Righteous
[4022.06 --> 4023.38]  And sinful
[4023.38 --> 4024.80]  If
[4024.80 --> 4026.06]  By grace
[4026.06 --> 4026.90]  Through faith
[4026.90 --> 4028.32]  You believe
[4028.32 --> 4029.26]  That's what
[4029.26 --> 4029.94]  Verse 5
[4029.94 --> 4030.56]  Means
[4030.56 --> 4031.20]  That's the point
[4031.20 --> 4031.86]  That Paul
[4031.86 --> 4032.48]  Has been making
[4032.48 --> 4032.78]  Here
[4032.78 --> 4033.02]  Right?
[4033.06 --> 4033.34]  He says
[4033.34 --> 4034.00]  However
[4034.00 --> 4034.70]  To the one
[4034.70 --> 4035.58]  Who does not
[4035.58 --> 4036.12]  Work
[4036.12 --> 4037.00]  But trusts
[4037.00 --> 4037.58]  God
[4037.58 --> 4039.16]  Who justifies
[4039.16 --> 4040.02]  The ungodly
[4040.02 --> 4040.92]  Their faith
[4040.92 --> 4041.78]  Is credited
[4041.78 --> 4043.28]  As righteous
[4043.28 --> 4044.84]  Right?
[4044.90 --> 4045.80]  God justifies
[4045.80 --> 4046.68]  The ungodly
[4046.68 --> 4047.40]  The sinful
[4047.40 --> 4048.84]  Because of faith
[4048.84 --> 4049.94]  And credits them
[4049.94 --> 4050.88]  Righteous
[4050.88 --> 4052.12]  Now sometimes
[4052.12 --> 4052.94]  You might hear
[4052.94 --> 4054.12]  Me use the language
[4054.12 --> 4055.50]  Of imputed
[4055.50 --> 4056.64]  Righteousness
[4056.64 --> 4057.16]  Right?
[4057.20 --> 4057.96]  That the perfect
[4057.96 --> 4058.90]  Righteousness
[4058.90 --> 4059.38]  Of Jesus
[4059.38 --> 4060.38]  The perfect
[4060.38 --> 4061.10]  Obedience
[4061.10 --> 4061.58]  Of Jesus
[4061.58 --> 4062.56]  Is imputed
[4062.56 --> 4063.72]  Is given over
[4063.72 --> 4064.48]  Or in the language
[4064.48 --> 4065.02]  Of our text
[4065.02 --> 4066.24]  Is credited
[4066.24 --> 4068.14]  Is counted
[4068.14 --> 4068.80]  As
[4068.80 --> 4070.08]  Yours
[4070.08 --> 4073.88]  And so here
[4073.88 --> 4075.60]  Again to recap
[4075.60 --> 4076.20]  The summary
[4076.20 --> 4076.80]  That Paul
[4076.80 --> 4077.30]  Is making
[4077.30 --> 4078.24]  Either
[4078.24 --> 4080.62]  Our righteousness
[4080.62 --> 4081.96]  Is merited
[4081.96 --> 4083.32]  By our works
[4083.32 --> 4085.10]  Or
[4085.10 --> 4086.16]  It is credited
[4086.16 --> 4086.88]  To us
[4086.88 --> 4087.58]  Without regard
[4087.58 --> 4088.46]  For what we've done
[4088.46 --> 4089.72]  Right?
[4089.76 --> 4090.62]  That's verse 4
[4090.62 --> 4091.40]  To the one
[4091.40 --> 4092.04]  Who works
[4092.04 --> 4092.60]  Wages
[4092.60 --> 4093.48]  Are not credited
[4093.48 --> 4094.28]  As a gift
[4094.28 --> 4095.44]  But as an obligation
[4095.44 --> 4097.02]  Right?
[4097.10 --> 4098.28]  Wages aren't credited
[4098.28 --> 4100.20]  They aren't freely given
[4100.20 --> 4100.92]  Because
[4100.92 --> 4101.96]  They're
[4101.96 --> 4103.02]  Required
[4103.02 --> 4104.54]  Right?
[4104.60 --> 4105.62]  The work you do
[4105.62 --> 4106.58]  You ought to get
[4106.58 --> 4107.62]  Paid for
[4107.62 --> 4108.14]  Right?
[4108.18 --> 4109.06]  And if there is
[4109.06 --> 4110.08]  A work that you can do
[4110.08 --> 4110.96]  To get salvation
[4110.96 --> 4112.88]  Then God is obligated
[4112.88 --> 4114.02]  To give that to you
[4114.02 --> 4114.70]  If you do
[4114.70 --> 4115.56]  The work
[4115.56 --> 4117.20]  Right?
[4117.22 --> 4117.90]  It's not a gift
[4117.90 --> 4119.72]  And of course
[4119.72 --> 4121.44]  If you read the Bible
[4121.44 --> 4122.28]  Right?
[4122.32 --> 4123.22]  From beginning to end
[4123.22 --> 4124.00]  Or even in
[4124.00 --> 4125.40]  These small parts
[4125.40 --> 4126.98]  There's no obligation
[4126.98 --> 4128.18]  That we can put on God
[4128.18 --> 4129.04]  Right?
[4129.04 --> 4129.66]  That doesn't fit
[4129.66 --> 4130.76]  With what we read
[4130.76 --> 4131.66]  In Genesis 15
[4131.66 --> 4133.10]  Or what we see
[4133.10 --> 4133.78]  In the person
[4133.78 --> 4135.24]  Of Jesus Christ
[4135.24 --> 4137.64]  Either
[4137.64 --> 4139.78]  It's merited by works
[4139.78 --> 4141.12]  Or it's credited
[4141.12 --> 4141.80]  Without regard
[4141.80 --> 4142.54]  For what we've done
[4142.54 --> 4144.18]  And time
[4144.18 --> 4144.86]  And time
[4144.86 --> 4145.48]  And time
[4145.48 --> 4145.84]  Again
[4145.84 --> 4147.24]  We want
[4147.24 --> 4148.10]  In our minds
[4148.10 --> 4149.24]  Because it's the only thing
[4149.24 --> 4149.98]  That makes sense
[4149.98 --> 4151.22]  To come back
[4151.22 --> 4151.90]  To this
[4151.90 --> 4152.36]  Merited
[4152.36 --> 4153.58]  By works
[4153.58 --> 4155.04]  There's a preacher
[4155.04 --> 4155.72]  I can't remember
[4155.72 --> 4157.14]  Who I heard it from
[4157.14 --> 4157.56]  Now
[4157.56 --> 4158.02]  He said
[4158.02 --> 4158.56]  That
[4158.56 --> 4159.86]  As human beings
[4159.86 --> 4160.70]  We all want
[4160.70 --> 4161.58]  Free things
[4161.58 --> 4163.54]  Until it comes
[4163.54 --> 4164.12]  To salvation
[4164.12 --> 4165.90]  Then we want
[4165.90 --> 4166.60]  To earn it
[4166.60 --> 4169.10]  Sometimes
[4169.10 --> 4169.98]  In conversations
[4169.98 --> 4170.54]  That I have
[4170.54 --> 4171.00]  With people
[4171.00 --> 4172.48]  Whether it's
[4172.48 --> 4173.34]  In pastoral counseling
[4173.34 --> 4173.86]  Whether it's
[4173.86 --> 4174.70]  Teaching a class
[4174.70 --> 4175.76]  On the Christian faith
[4175.76 --> 4177.08]  I will ask
[4177.08 --> 4177.72]  The question
[4177.72 --> 4179.54]  What do you think
[4179.54 --> 4180.58]  It means to be Christian?
[4181.26 --> 4182.04]  What does it mean
[4182.04 --> 4182.62]  To be
[4182.62 --> 4183.46]  Leave?
[4183.76 --> 4184.32]  What does it mean
[4184.32 --> 4185.24]  To be saved?
[4185.24 --> 4187.50]  And often times
[4187.50 --> 4188.64]  The answers I get
[4188.64 --> 4190.30]  Are kind of a variation
[4190.30 --> 4190.88]  On a theme
[4190.88 --> 4191.96]  Right
[4191.96 --> 4193.10]  One person might say
[4193.10 --> 4193.64]  Well
[4193.64 --> 4195.52]  It means that I try my best
[4195.52 --> 4196.90]  To be a good person
[4196.90 --> 4198.30]  To be a good Christian
[4198.30 --> 4200.66]  Another person
[4200.66 --> 4201.46]  Will say
[4201.46 --> 4201.70]  Well
[4201.70 --> 4203.36]  It means that I believe in God
[4203.36 --> 4204.94]  And that I try to do His will
[4204.94 --> 4206.96]  And then another person
[4206.96 --> 4207.72]  Might come along
[4207.72 --> 4208.08]  And say
[4208.08 --> 4208.54]  Well
[4208.54 --> 4209.48]  To be a Christian
[4209.48 --> 4210.90]  Means that I believe in God
[4210.90 --> 4212.00]  With all my heart
[4212.00 --> 4215.18]  You know what ties
[4215.18 --> 4215.84]  All three of these
[4215.84 --> 4216.78]  Kinds of answers together?
[4218.78 --> 4220.50]  Is that so many of us
[4220.50 --> 4222.32]  Have operationally
[4222.32 --> 4223.00]  Right
[4223.00 --> 4224.44]  In actual practice
[4224.44 --> 4225.60]  Been thinking about
[4225.60 --> 4226.64]  Christian faith
[4226.64 --> 4227.38]  And salvation
[4227.38 --> 4229.00]  As a form of work
[4229.00 --> 4230.54]  Right
[4230.54 --> 4231.44]  We say something like
[4231.44 --> 4231.94]  Well
[4231.94 --> 4232.42]  You know
[4232.42 --> 4233.28]  I try my best
[4233.28 --> 4234.22]  To be a good person
[4234.22 --> 4235.08]  We are saying
[4235.08 --> 4236.38]  That salvation comes by
[4236.38 --> 4236.96]  Works
[4236.96 --> 4237.66]  That we're saved
[4237.66 --> 4238.76]  By being good
[4238.76 --> 4239.60]  That what matters
[4239.60 --> 4240.82]  Is that I try my best
[4240.82 --> 4243.46]  And when we say something
[4243.46 --> 4244.08]  Like
[4244.08 --> 4245.12]  In the next example
[4245.12 --> 4246.16]  I believe God
[4246.16 --> 4247.68]  And I try to do His will
[4247.68 --> 4248.40]  We are saying
[4248.40 --> 4249.50]  That salvation comes
[4249.50 --> 4250.46]  With faith
[4250.46 --> 4251.64]  And works
[4251.64 --> 4253.68]  So we need a little bit
[4253.68 --> 4254.04]  Of faith
[4254.04 --> 4254.86]  Then we need a little bit
[4254.86 --> 4255.22]  Of works
[4255.22 --> 4255.84]  And then once you
[4255.84 --> 4256.64]  Stir those all up
[4256.64 --> 4257.72]  Then you get salvation
[4257.72 --> 4259.48]  And then lastly
[4259.48 --> 4260.84]  When we say something like
[4260.84 --> 4262.42]  That I believe in God
[4262.42 --> 4263.50]  With all my heart
[4263.50 --> 4265.46]  We turn faith
[4265.46 --> 4266.70]  Into a kind of work
[4266.70 --> 4267.44]  That we do
[4267.44 --> 4268.66]  And then you make it again
[4268.66 --> 4269.48]  Remember from the beginning
[4269.48 --> 4270.76]  About the intensity
[4270.76 --> 4272.14]  Of what you believe
[4272.14 --> 4274.06]  The intensity
[4274.06 --> 4274.82]  Of our belief
[4274.82 --> 4275.88]  Then becomes
[4275.88 --> 4278.40]  The justifying factor
[4278.40 --> 4280.40]  Right
[4280.40 --> 4280.72]  Paul
[4280.72 --> 4282.78]  Has just said
[4282.78 --> 4283.20]  Though
[4283.20 --> 4284.76]  In verse 4
[4284.76 --> 4285.80]  And 5
[4285.80 --> 4287.70]  That saving faith
[4287.70 --> 4289.28]  Means you do not work
[4289.28 --> 4291.46]  But trust
[4291.46 --> 4294.26]  But the kind of faith
[4294.26 --> 4296.42]  That Paul is referring to
[4296.42 --> 4297.50]  And grounding us in
[4297.50 --> 4298.60]  And opening our eyes
[4298.60 --> 4300.92]  To is not the kind of faith
[4300.92 --> 4301.98]  That just believes
[4301.98 --> 4303.06]  That God is there
[4303.06 --> 4304.98]  It's not the kind of faith
[4304.98 --> 4306.72]  That just believes
[4306.72 --> 4307.80]  That God is there
[4307.80 --> 4309.14]  And that He saves
[4309.14 --> 4309.90]  Right
[4309.90 --> 4311.02]  The kind of faith
[4311.02 --> 4311.78]  That is credited
[4311.78 --> 4312.62]  To Abraham
[4312.62 --> 4313.70]  As righteousness
[4313.70 --> 4314.88]  Is a faith
[4314.88 --> 4316.04]  That believes
[4316.04 --> 4317.64]  In the object
[4317.64 --> 4319.00]  Of that faith
[4319.00 --> 4320.08]  In the person
[4320.08 --> 4321.76]  Of Jesus Christ
[4321.76 --> 4322.86]  In Abraham's case
[4322.86 --> 4323.74]  Hoped for
[4323.74 --> 4324.92]  In our case for
[4324.92 --> 4325.96]  Realized
[4325.96 --> 4326.72]  That believes
[4326.72 --> 4327.42]  In the object
[4327.42 --> 4328.72]  Of our faith
[4328.72 --> 4330.16]  And in the promise
[4330.16 --> 4331.28]  Of the way
[4331.28 --> 4331.92]  Of salvation
[4331.92 --> 4333.20]  By grace
[4333.20 --> 4335.56]  And here's the thing
[4335.56 --> 4340.28]  And this is the danger
[4340.28 --> 4342.48]  For most of you
[4342.48 --> 4343.32]  Here this morning
[4343.32 --> 4344.60]  Right
[4344.60 --> 4345.16]  For most of you
[4345.16 --> 4346.78]  Who have been connected
[4346.78 --> 4347.28]  To church
[4347.28 --> 4348.22]  Or grown up in church
[4348.22 --> 4349.78]  Or been hearing
[4349.78 --> 4351.08]  Lord willing
[4351.08 --> 4352.18]  A version of this
[4352.18 --> 4352.94]  Truth
[4352.94 --> 4354.14]  Your entire life
[4354.14 --> 4354.90]  Here's the danger
[4354.90 --> 4356.22]  That most of us
[4356.22 --> 4356.94]  Face
[4356.94 --> 4358.74]  Because you can have
[4358.74 --> 4360.68]  An incredibly strong
[4360.68 --> 4361.28]  Faith
[4361.28 --> 4362.58]  That God exists
[4362.58 --> 4364.32]  You can have
[4364.32 --> 4365.80]  An incredibly strong
[4365.80 --> 4367.16]  And convicted faith
[4367.16 --> 4368.46]  That God is loving
[4368.46 --> 4370.02]  And that He is holy
[4370.02 --> 4370.98]  Right
[4370.98 --> 4371.44]  You can have
[4371.44 --> 4372.38]  A strong faith
[4372.38 --> 4373.14]  That the Bible
[4373.14 --> 4374.70]  Is God's word
[4374.70 --> 4375.48]  And you can show
[4375.48 --> 4376.38]  Great respect
[4376.38 --> 4377.92]  And even reverence
[4377.92 --> 4378.80]  For God
[4378.80 --> 4379.58]  And yet
[4379.58 --> 4380.56]  The whole time
[4380.56 --> 4381.40]  Be seeking
[4381.40 --> 4382.32]  Your own Savior
[4382.32 --> 4383.18]  Be seeking
[4383.18 --> 4384.78]  Your own self-justification
[4384.78 --> 4386.16]  Trusting in your own
[4386.16 --> 4386.76]  Performance
[4386.76 --> 4387.54]  Or religion
[4387.54 --> 4388.98]  Or moral character
[4388.98 --> 4390.28]  Or whatever it is
[4390.28 --> 4391.04]  That you do
[4391.04 --> 4393.70]  And let me just say
[4393.70 --> 4394.58]  This might be
[4394.58 --> 4396.24]  This might be too bold
[4396.24 --> 4396.98]  For some of you
[4396.98 --> 4401.02]  If you've ever had anxiety
[4401.02 --> 4403.20]  About whether or not
[4403.20 --> 4404.04]  You are saved
[4404.04 --> 4406.28]  If you've ever been afraid
[4406.28 --> 4407.28]  About whether or not
[4407.28 --> 4408.12]  You are forgiven
[4408.12 --> 4408.92]  Right
[4408.92 --> 4410.06]  If you are looking
[4410.06 --> 4410.78]  At yourself
[4410.78 --> 4411.74]  And your experience
[4411.74 --> 4412.30]  Of God
[4412.30 --> 4412.82]  And religion
[4412.82 --> 4413.48]  And faith
[4413.48 --> 4414.12]  Right
[4414.12 --> 4414.76]  In this way
[4414.76 --> 4417.02]  And worried about it
[4417.02 --> 4420.06]  That's the wrong idea
[4420.06 --> 4420.78]  Of faith
[4420.78 --> 4422.54]  Right
[4422.54 --> 4423.62]  That you are still
[4423.62 --> 4424.12]  Thinking
[4424.12 --> 4424.80]  It's something
[4424.80 --> 4425.82]  You can earn
[4425.82 --> 4427.54]  You are still
[4427.54 --> 4428.30]  Thinking then
[4428.30 --> 4429.06]  If it's something
[4429.06 --> 4429.76]  You can earn
[4429.76 --> 4430.94]  It's also something
[4430.94 --> 4432.44]  You can lose
[4432.44 --> 4435.22]  But the faith
[4435.22 --> 4435.78]  In the Bible
[4435.78 --> 4436.54]  Is not
[4436.54 --> 4437.36]  That
[4437.36 --> 4439.30]  You are trusting
[4439.30 --> 4440.42]  In your own
[4440.42 --> 4441.64]  Ability to trust
[4441.64 --> 4443.84]  And then when
[4443.84 --> 4444.50]  Your ability
[4444.50 --> 4445.16]  To trust
[4445.16 --> 4446.16]  Fails
[4446.16 --> 4447.42]  It feels like
[4447.42 --> 4448.04]  Your salvation
[4448.04 --> 4449.12]  Fails with it
[4449.12 --> 4451.26]  Now
[4451.26 --> 4452.86]  If that's where
[4452.86 --> 4453.34]  You are at
[4453.34 --> 4453.74]  This morning
[4453.74 --> 4454.20]  Or if you
[4454.20 --> 4455.20]  Have felt this way
[4455.20 --> 4455.56]  Before
[4455.56 --> 4458.58]  There's good news
[4458.58 --> 4459.04]  For you
[4459.04 --> 4459.80]  Right
[4459.80 --> 4460.76]  There's gospel
[4460.76 --> 4461.36]  For you
[4461.36 --> 4462.58]  In this text
[4462.58 --> 4462.78]  Right
[4462.78 --> 4464.06]  That saving faith
[4464.06 --> 4464.78]  The faith
[4464.78 --> 4465.70]  That we read
[4465.70 --> 4466.46]  About in the Bible
[4466.46 --> 4466.96]  Is
[4466.96 --> 4469.18]  The ending
[4469.18 --> 4470.50]  Of one kind
[4470.50 --> 4471.02]  Of trust
[4471.02 --> 4471.54]  Whether it's
[4471.54 --> 4472.24]  Trusting in
[4472.24 --> 4472.92]  Your trust
[4472.92 --> 4473.46]  Or trusting
[4473.46 --> 4474.50]  In your ability
[4474.50 --> 4475.80]  And the beginning
[4475.80 --> 4476.92]  Of a new kind
[4476.92 --> 4477.52]  Of trust
[4477.52 --> 4478.66]  Right
[4478.66 --> 4479.32]  Tim Keller
[4479.32 --> 4480.02]  Calls this
[4480.02 --> 4481.78]  A trust transfer
[4481.78 --> 4483.24]  Where you consciously
[4483.24 --> 4484.74]  See where your trust
[4484.74 --> 4485.28]  Is
[4485.28 --> 4485.94]  And you
[4485.94 --> 4487.56]  Remove your hopes
[4487.56 --> 4488.20]  And your trust
[4488.20 --> 4489.10]  From those things
[4489.10 --> 4490.14]  And you place
[4490.14 --> 4491.30]  Them on God
[4491.30 --> 4493.08]  As your savior
[4493.08 --> 4494.70]  Right
[4494.70 --> 4495.38]  And to the Jews
[4495.38 --> 4496.38]  Of Paul's day
[4496.38 --> 4497.66]  Their trust
[4497.66 --> 4498.84]  Was in something
[4498.84 --> 4500.68]  Like their circumcision
[4500.68 --> 4502.10]  Right
[4502.10 --> 4502.88]  It was in something
[4502.88 --> 4503.84]  Like their
[4503.84 --> 4505.26]  Ethnic identity
[4505.26 --> 4506.32]  Or their connection
[4506.32 --> 4507.24]  To the monarchy
[4507.24 --> 4508.62]  In either Abraham
[4508.62 --> 4509.66]  Or David
[4509.66 --> 4513.90]  Verse 11
[4513.90 --> 4515.38]  Paul writes
[4515.38 --> 4516.08]  He, Abraham
[4516.08 --> 4517.28]  Received circumcision
[4517.28 --> 4518.10]  As a sign
[4518.10 --> 4518.70]  And seal
[4518.70 --> 4519.46]  Of righteousness
[4519.46 --> 4520.60]  That he had
[4520.60 --> 4521.26]  By faith
[4521.26 --> 4522.26]  While he was
[4522.26 --> 4522.76]  Still
[4522.76 --> 4524.62]  Uncircumcised
[4524.62 --> 4528.34]  Paul's point
[4528.34 --> 4528.94]  Is that the
[4528.94 --> 4529.80]  Righteousness
[4529.80 --> 4530.50]  That Abraham
[4530.50 --> 4531.60]  Had
[4531.60 --> 4532.42]  Came to him
[4532.42 --> 4533.76]  Before he was
[4533.76 --> 4534.60]  Circumcised
[4534.60 --> 4535.88]  Because he believed
[4535.88 --> 4537.82]  And so if you
[4537.82 --> 4538.60]  Are relying
[4538.60 --> 4539.36]  On something
[4539.36 --> 4540.20]  You do
[4540.20 --> 4541.24]  To have that
[4541.24 --> 4541.72]  Righteousness
[4541.72 --> 4542.30]  Or to claim
[4542.30 --> 4543.12]  That identity
[4543.12 --> 4544.00]  Like the Jews
[4544.00 --> 4544.44]  Of his day
[4544.44 --> 4545.50]  Were in circumcision
[4545.50 --> 4546.90]  You are missing
[4546.90 --> 4548.42]  The point
[4548.42 --> 4549.66]  Right
[4549.66 --> 4550.64]  The act
[4550.64 --> 4551.46]  Of circumcision
[4551.46 --> 4552.38]  Is a sign
[4552.38 --> 4553.72]  And a seal
[4553.72 --> 4554.86]  Of something
[4554.86 --> 4556.34]  That precedes
[4556.34 --> 4557.78]  Of a spiritual
[4557.78 --> 4558.58]  Reality
[4558.58 --> 4559.70]  That has already
[4559.70 --> 4560.92]  Taken place
[4560.92 --> 4563.26]  For those of you
[4563.26 --> 4563.60]  Who are in the
[4563.60 --> 4563.72]  Note
[4563.72 --> 4564.84]  We use that
[4564.84 --> 4565.58]  Language today
[4565.58 --> 4566.22]  Right
[4566.22 --> 4567.18]  About our sacraments
[4567.18 --> 4567.64]  Next week
[4567.64 --> 4568.02]  We're going to
[4568.02 --> 4568.66]  Come to the
[4568.66 --> 4569.20]  Lord's table
[4569.20 --> 4569.94]  We talk about
[4569.94 --> 4570.88]  The Lord's table
[4570.88 --> 4571.82]  As a sign
[4571.82 --> 4573.04]  And a seal
[4573.04 --> 4574.52]  Of a spiritual
[4574.52 --> 4575.16]  Reality
[4575.16 --> 4575.78]  That's already
[4575.78 --> 4576.48]  Taken place
[4576.48 --> 4577.62]  So we come
[4577.62 --> 4578.40]  To the table
[4578.40 --> 4578.96]  Right
[4578.96 --> 4579.32]  We're not
[4579.32 --> 4580.60]  There to
[4580.60 --> 4582.90]  Receive
[4582.90 --> 4583.52]  Something that
[4583.52 --> 4583.98]  We haven't
[4583.98 --> 4584.60]  Yet received
[4584.60 --> 4585.48]  Right
[4585.48 --> 4585.84]  We're not there
[4585.84 --> 4586.30]  To receive
[4586.30 --> 4586.96]  A new
[4586.96 --> 4587.88]  Grace
[4587.88 --> 4588.56]  Or a new
[4588.56 --> 4589.00]  Encounter
[4589.00 --> 4589.50]  With God
[4589.50 --> 4590.60]  We are receiving
[4590.60 --> 4591.10]  What we have
[4591.10 --> 4592.02]  Already been
[4592.02 --> 4592.62]  Declared
[4592.62 --> 4593.40]  To be
[4593.40 --> 4595.36]  It's a sign
[4595.36 --> 4595.94]  And a seal
[4595.94 --> 4596.56]  It's made
[4596.56 --> 4597.76]  Tangible
[4597.76 --> 4598.56]  Right
[4598.56 --> 4598.92]  In the case
[4598.92 --> 4599.28]  Of Lord's
[4599.28 --> 4599.42]  Supper
[4599.42 --> 4599.80]  It's made
[4599.80 --> 4600.70]  Tasteable
[4600.70 --> 4602.06]  As you come
[4602.06 --> 4602.96]  And receive
[4602.96 --> 4603.68]  And see
[4603.68 --> 4604.22]  That you have
[4604.22 --> 4605.22]  Been received
[4605.22 --> 4606.96]  By God
[4606.96 --> 4608.28]  Right
[4608.28 --> 4608.98]  It's a sign
[4608.98 --> 4609.62]  And a seal
[4609.62 --> 4610.74]  Of the promises
[4610.74 --> 4612.46]  Of faith
[4612.46 --> 4613.52]  The promises
[4613.52 --> 4614.34]  Of the gospel
[4614.34 --> 4616.14]  Right
[4616.14 --> 4616.52]  That
[4616.52 --> 4620.50]  That it is not
[4620.50 --> 4621.18]  Through the law
[4621.18 --> 4621.60]  That Abraham
[4621.60 --> 4622.28]  In his offering
[4622.28 --> 4623.60]  Received the promise
[4623.60 --> 4624.38]  That he would be
[4624.38 --> 4625.26]  Heir of the world
[4625.26 --> 4626.64]  But through the righteousness
[4626.64 --> 4627.46]  That comes
[4627.46 --> 4628.58]  By faith
[4628.58 --> 4629.58]  Or verse 16
[4629.58 --> 4630.12]  The promise
[4630.12 --> 4631.20]  Comes by faith
[4631.20 --> 4631.94]  So that it may be
[4631.94 --> 4632.60]  By grace
[4632.60 --> 4633.48]  And may be
[4633.48 --> 4634.64]  Guaranteed
[4634.64 --> 4636.02]  To all Abraham's
[4636.02 --> 4636.46]  Offspring
[4636.46 --> 4636.98]  Hear that
[4636.98 --> 4638.20]  Only the promise
[4638.20 --> 4639.26]  That comes by faith
[4639.26 --> 4640.14]  Is guaranteed
[4640.14 --> 4641.86]  Everything else
[4641.86 --> 4643.24]  Will fall short
[4643.24 --> 4644.20]  And then 17
[4644.20 --> 4645.54]  The end
[4645.54 --> 4646.72]  The God
[4646.72 --> 4648.02]  Who gives
[4648.02 --> 4648.76]  Life
[4648.76 --> 4650.82]  To the dead
[4650.82 --> 4652.20]  And calls
[4652.20 --> 4653.42]  Into being
[4653.42 --> 4654.38]  Things
[4654.38 --> 4655.02]  That were
[4655.02 --> 4655.86]  Not
[4655.86 --> 4658.04]  This is the promise
[4658.04 --> 4658.72]  Of faith
[4658.72 --> 4659.72]  Right
[4659.72 --> 4660.12]  That God
[4660.12 --> 4660.92]  Calls
[4660.92 --> 4661.62]  Out
[4661.62 --> 4662.34]  Life
[4662.34 --> 4663.66]  From death
[4663.66 --> 4664.18]  And calls
[4664.18 --> 4664.76]  Into being
[4664.76 --> 4665.34]  Things that
[4665.34 --> 4665.74]  Were not
[4665.74 --> 4666.66]  And in the case
[4666.66 --> 4667.20]  Of Abraham
[4667.20 --> 4667.86]  That happens
[4667.86 --> 4668.56]  Time and again
[4668.56 --> 4668.80]  Right
[4668.80 --> 4669.06]  You have
[4669.06 --> 4669.84]  He calls
[4669.84 --> 4670.68]  Life from death
[4670.68 --> 4671.14]  In the story
[4671.14 --> 4671.74]  Of Isaac
[4671.74 --> 4672.70]  Right
[4672.70 --> 4674.00]  Who is saved
[4674.00 --> 4675.10]  And a ram
[4675.10 --> 4675.64]  Is offered
[4675.64 --> 4676.32]  In place
[4676.32 --> 4677.60]  Saved from death
[4677.60 --> 4678.24]  So that he might
[4678.24 --> 4679.56]  Have life
[4679.56 --> 4680.38]  Right
[4680.38 --> 4681.14]  In the story
[4681.14 --> 4681.94]  As it continues
[4681.94 --> 4683.02]  We have the resurrection
[4683.02 --> 4683.58]  Of Jesus
[4683.58 --> 4683.94]  Right
[4683.94 --> 4685.06]  Who died
[4685.06 --> 4686.44]  Though he lived
[4686.44 --> 4687.16]  Perfectly
[4687.16 --> 4687.90]  On a cross
[4687.90 --> 4688.48]  He died
[4688.48 --> 4689.46]  In our place
[4689.46 --> 4690.68]  And then was raised
[4690.68 --> 4691.92]  Three days later
[4691.92 --> 4693.16]  And that power
[4693.16 --> 4693.92]  Of the resurrection
[4693.92 --> 4694.70]  Continues
[4694.70 --> 4695.26]  As it is guaranteed
[4695.26 --> 4696.34]  Even to you now
[4696.34 --> 4697.08]  As we
[4697.08 --> 4697.94]  As Paul has said
[4697.94 --> 4698.78]  Are dead
[4698.78 --> 4699.92]  In our transgressions
[4699.92 --> 4700.36]  And sins
[4700.36 --> 4701.60]  We are raised
[4701.60 --> 4702.52]  To newness
[4702.52 --> 4703.62]  Of life
[4703.62 --> 4705.36]  This is the promise
[4705.36 --> 4706.48]  Of the gospel
[4706.48 --> 4707.38]  This is the promise
[4707.38 --> 4708.78]  That is affirmed
[4708.78 --> 4709.68]  Again and again
[4709.68 --> 4710.46]  In the signs
[4710.46 --> 4711.38]  And seals
[4711.38 --> 4712.28]  Of our faith
[4712.28 --> 4713.40]  And let me tell you
[4713.40 --> 4714.26]  What this promise
[4714.26 --> 4714.96]  Is not
[4714.96 --> 4718.54]  It is not
[4718.54 --> 4720.40]  A leap of faith
[4720.40 --> 4722.00]  That is
[4722.00 --> 4725.44]  A casting off
[4725.44 --> 4727.26]  Of our rational
[4727.26 --> 4728.52]  Faculties
[4728.52 --> 4729.88]  It's not
[4729.88 --> 4731.62]  A blind trust
[4731.62 --> 4733.20]  Okay
[4733.20 --> 4734.10]  There is
[4734.10 --> 4734.76]  I'll put it this way
[4734.76 --> 4735.88]  There is nothing
[4735.88 --> 4737.28]  More reasonable
[4737.28 --> 4739.26]  Than faith in God
[4739.26 --> 4741.84]  Let me say that again
[4741.84 --> 4742.38]  There's nothing
[4742.38 --> 4743.24]  More reasonable
[4743.24 --> 4744.42]  Than faith in God
[4744.42 --> 4744.66]  Listen
[4744.66 --> 4745.74]  This is who God is
[4745.74 --> 4746.62]  The God who gives
[4746.62 --> 4747.52]  Life to the dead
[4747.52 --> 4748.80]  And calls into being
[4748.80 --> 4749.76]  Things that were
[4749.76 --> 4750.54]  Not
[4750.54 --> 4753.20]  And if he can do that
[4753.20 --> 4754.76]  Right
[4754.76 --> 4756.06]  The illogical thing
[4756.06 --> 4758.24]  Is to not believe
[4758.24 --> 4760.96]  The irrational thing
[4760.96 --> 4762.40]  Is to reject him
[4762.40 --> 4765.42]  The reasonable thing
[4765.42 --> 4767.38]  Is to believe
[4767.38 --> 4768.44]  And to have faith
[4768.44 --> 4769.46]  Now
[4769.46 --> 4770.88]  I'll say this
[4770.88 --> 4774.22]  Faith without reason
[4774.22 --> 4775.48]  Is what
[4775.48 --> 4777.26]  Biblical scholars
[4777.26 --> 4777.60]  Might call
[4777.60 --> 4778.30]  Feedism
[4778.30 --> 4779.22]  Right
[4779.22 --> 4780.22]  And that comes back
[4780.22 --> 4780.88]  To the intensity
[4780.88 --> 4781.88]  Of our feelings
[4781.88 --> 4783.54]  And reason
[4783.54 --> 4784.44]  Without faith
[4784.44 --> 4785.96]  Is rationalism
[4785.96 --> 4788.12]  Both are wrong
[4788.12 --> 4788.14]  Both are wrong
[4788.14 --> 4791.56]  Paul says
[4791.56 --> 4792.70]  Here
[4792.70 --> 4794.22]  In Ephesians 2
[4794.22 --> 4794.68]  Now
[4794.68 --> 4795.78]  By grace
[4795.78 --> 4796.84]  You have been saved
[4796.84 --> 4797.60]  Through faith
[4797.60 --> 4798.56]  And this
[4798.56 --> 4799.60]  Is the gift
[4799.60 --> 4800.82]  Of God
[4800.82 --> 4802.80]  Hear that
[4802.80 --> 4804.20]  Faith
[4804.20 --> 4805.60]  Is the gift
[4805.60 --> 4807.62]  Of God
[4807.62 --> 4809.20]  What is faith
[4809.20 --> 4810.96]  Faith is the trust
[4810.96 --> 4812.90]  Faith is trust
[4812.90 --> 4813.82]  In the person
[4813.82 --> 4814.64]  Of Jesus
[4814.64 --> 4815.70]  And the promise
[4815.70 --> 4816.74]  Of the gospel
[4816.74 --> 4818.28]  That is gifted
[4818.28 --> 4819.18]  To you
[4819.18 --> 4820.58]  By grace
[4820.58 --> 4827.32]  But that faith
[4827.32 --> 4829.98]  Becomes exercised
[4829.98 --> 4831.26]  In your belief
[4831.26 --> 4833.20]  That gift
[4833.20 --> 4835.10]  Is made real
[4835.10 --> 4836.84]  In how you see
[4836.84 --> 4837.50]  The world
[4837.50 --> 4838.10]  Now
[4838.10 --> 4840.28]  And so this is where
[4840.28 --> 4840.74]  We're going to look
[4840.74 --> 4841.34]  Very quickly
[4841.34 --> 4843.06]  At the last few verses
[4843.06 --> 4843.94]  That we didn't read
[4843.94 --> 4845.46]  So what does it mean
[4845.46 --> 4846.60]  To believe God
[4846.60 --> 4847.88]  So faith is the gift
[4847.88 --> 4849.08]  And Abraham's faith
[4849.08 --> 4849.88]  Was credited to him
[4849.88 --> 4850.50]  As righteousness
[4850.50 --> 4851.86]  That is made manifest
[4851.86 --> 4853.82]  Now in your belief
[4853.82 --> 4855.80]  Abraham shows us
[4855.80 --> 4858.52]  Verse 19
[4858.52 --> 4859.94]  Without weakening
[4859.94 --> 4860.66]  His faith
[4860.66 --> 4862.00]  He faced the fact
[4862.00 --> 4862.82]  That his body
[4862.82 --> 4863.62]  Was as good
[4863.62 --> 4864.50]  As dead
[4864.50 --> 4865.46]  Since he was about
[4865.46 --> 4866.32]  100 years old
[4866.32 --> 4867.46]  And that Sarah's womb
[4867.46 --> 4868.36]  Was also dead
[4868.36 --> 4870.58]  Right so in Abraham's story
[4870.58 --> 4871.88]  He was promised a child
[4871.88 --> 4873.56]  And that child
[4873.56 --> 4874.10]  Never came
[4874.10 --> 4875.80]  And it never came
[4875.80 --> 4877.06]  And it never came
[4877.06 --> 4878.10]  And it never came
[4878.10 --> 4878.94]  We don't know exactly
[4878.94 --> 4879.30]  How long
[4879.30 --> 4879.76]  But it might have been
[4879.76 --> 4880.58]  40 years
[4880.58 --> 4882.04]  Since the promise
[4882.04 --> 4883.26]  Was first spoken to him
[4883.26 --> 4884.72]  That he would be
[4884.72 --> 4885.84]  A father of many nations
[4885.84 --> 4887.54]  And his wife
[4887.54 --> 4888.16]  Remained barren
[4888.16 --> 4889.52]  And when she is
[4889.52 --> 4890.52]  In her 90s
[4890.52 --> 4891.74]  And he is equally
[4891.74 --> 4893.04]  As old or older
[4893.04 --> 4895.18]  Then they finally
[4895.18 --> 4896.52]  Have a child
[4896.52 --> 4897.64]  Right
[4897.64 --> 4900.10]  What does belief
[4900.10 --> 4901.00]  Look like
[4901.00 --> 4901.68]  What does it mean
[4901.68 --> 4903.22]  To believe in God
[4903.22 --> 4904.30]  What does Abraham show us
[4904.30 --> 4905.60]  That to know
[4905.60 --> 4906.88]  That reality
[4906.88 --> 4908.24]  Is greater
[4908.24 --> 4909.98]  Than how we feel
[4909.98 --> 4911.42]  Or how things appear
[4911.42 --> 4914.02]  That's what belief does
[4914.02 --> 4915.02]  Right
[4915.02 --> 4916.20]  To know that the reality
[4916.20 --> 4917.74]  That we live in
[4917.74 --> 4919.96]  Is greater than how we feel
[4919.96 --> 4920.96]  Or how things appear
[4920.96 --> 4922.12]  Right
[4922.12 --> 4923.88]  One person has said
[4923.88 --> 4925.16]  That faith is not opposed
[4925.16 --> 4925.88]  To reason
[4925.88 --> 4927.48]  But faith is sometimes
[4927.48 --> 4928.96]  Opposed to our feelings
[4928.96 --> 4930.38]  And to our appearances
[4930.38 --> 4932.42]  To what it seems like
[4932.42 --> 4933.24]  Is going on
[4933.24 --> 4935.32]  Secondly
[4935.32 --> 4937.08]  Faith
[4937.08 --> 4937.70]  And what it means
[4937.70 --> 4938.40]  To believe
[4938.40 --> 4940.08]  Is to focus on
[4940.08 --> 4942.32]  Facts about God
[4942.32 --> 4943.40]  Look at verse 20
[4943.40 --> 4944.28]  And 21
[4944.28 --> 4945.80]  Yet he
[4945.80 --> 4946.26]  Abraham
[4946.26 --> 4947.36]  Did not waver
[4947.36 --> 4948.46]  Through unbelief
[4948.46 --> 4949.42]  Regarding the promise
[4949.42 --> 4949.88]  Of God
[4949.88 --> 4950.74]  But was strengthened
[4950.74 --> 4951.56]  In his faith
[4951.56 --> 4952.98]  And gave glory to God
[4952.98 --> 4954.58]  Being fully persuaded
[4954.58 --> 4955.68]  That God had the power
[4955.68 --> 4957.44]  To do what he had promised
[4957.44 --> 4960.54]  Now what are these facts
[4960.54 --> 4961.90]  That he is fully persuaded by
[4961.90 --> 4963.18]  Again back to verse 17
[4963.18 --> 4964.52]  The God who gives life
[4964.52 --> 4965.10]  From the dead
[4965.10 --> 4966.38]  And calls into being
[4966.38 --> 4968.34]  Things that were not
[4968.34 --> 4971.30]  God created all that is
[4971.30 --> 4972.34]  Right
[4972.34 --> 4973.56]  He flung the stars
[4973.56 --> 4974.44]  Into the sky
[4974.44 --> 4975.76]  He formed the mountains
[4975.76 --> 4977.04]  With his words
[4977.04 --> 4979.14]  And he raised the dead
[4979.14 --> 4982.94]  And that you leave here
[4982.94 --> 4984.24]  Worrying about if he can
[4984.24 --> 4984.80]  Do your thing
[4984.80 --> 4987.64]  You're afraid
[4987.64 --> 4989.20]  Of what might happen
[4989.20 --> 4992.22]  Now listen carefully
[4992.22 --> 4992.96]  Okay
[4992.96 --> 4994.44]  Because that doesn't mean
[4994.44 --> 4995.38]  He'll do your thing
[4995.38 --> 4998.52]  It just means that he can
[4998.52 --> 5001.54]  And it also means
[5001.54 --> 5002.42]  That if he doesn't
[5002.42 --> 5005.22]  You can be absolutely sure
[5005.22 --> 5006.72]  That he has a reason
[5006.72 --> 5008.38]  And that his reason
[5008.38 --> 5008.90]  Is better
[5008.90 --> 5010.20]  Even if it makes
[5010.20 --> 5011.26]  No sense to you
[5011.26 --> 5012.38]  But that's the first thing
[5012.38 --> 5013.70]  Right
[5013.70 --> 5015.14]  That's how we know
[5015.14 --> 5016.32]  That reality is greater
[5016.32 --> 5017.16]  Than what we feel
[5017.16 --> 5018.62]  Or what things appear
[5018.62 --> 5020.52]  As we focus on facts
[5020.52 --> 5022.28]  About who God is
[5022.28 --> 5022.88]  And then finally
[5022.88 --> 5023.96]  What we learn from Abraham
[5023.96 --> 5026.08]  Is to trust
[5026.08 --> 5027.72]  The word of God
[5027.72 --> 5029.52]  To trust his promise
[5029.52 --> 5031.48]  Now verse 21
[5031.48 --> 5032.68]  Being fully persuaded
[5032.68 --> 5033.76]  That God had power
[5033.76 --> 5036.48]  To do what he had promised
[5036.48 --> 5038.02]  God has the power
[5038.02 --> 5040.40]  To do what he has promised
[5040.40 --> 5042.48]  Believing God
[5042.48 --> 5043.84]  Isn't simply believing
[5043.84 --> 5045.82]  Or thinking things about him
[5045.82 --> 5048.38]  But it is trusting him
[5048.38 --> 5050.40]  It is trusting his word
[5050.40 --> 5053.58]  It is to look at what God has said
[5053.58 --> 5057.04]  And let that define reality for you
[5057.04 --> 5060.04]  And increasingly
[5060.04 --> 5062.12]  Perhaps in today's world
[5062.12 --> 5063.32]  Your feelings
[5063.32 --> 5064.82]  Or popular opinion
[5064.82 --> 5066.34]  Or cultural ideologies
[5066.34 --> 5067.02]  And ideas
[5067.02 --> 5069.30]  Even what seems to so many
[5069.30 --> 5070.34]  Like common sense
[5070.34 --> 5072.04]  Might seem to contradict
[5072.04 --> 5073.96]  What God says
[5073.96 --> 5077.42]  But there's nothing more reasonable
[5077.42 --> 5079.66]  Than taking God at his word
[5079.66 --> 5082.30]  Because that's who he is
[5082.30 --> 5085.00]  And then finally
[5085.00 --> 5086.26]  And I'll land here
[5086.26 --> 5089.84]  Believing these things
[5089.84 --> 5094.20]  Leads to belonging
[5094.20 --> 5096.18]  And so really quickly
[5096.18 --> 5098.00]  Verse 16
[5098.00 --> 5100.04]  The promises come by faith
[5100.04 --> 5101.66]  So that it may be by grace
[5101.66 --> 5102.44]  And may be guaranteed
[5102.44 --> 5105.30]  To all Abraham's offspring
[5105.30 --> 5107.70]  Not only to those who are of the law
[5107.70 --> 5110.52]  But also to those who have the faith of Abraham
[5110.52 --> 5112.74]  Verse 9 is the same thing
[5112.74 --> 5113.80]  In question form
[5113.80 --> 5116.18]  Is this blessedness only for the circumcised
[5116.18 --> 5118.58]  Or also for the uncircumcised?
[5119.78 --> 5119.92]  Right?
[5119.98 --> 5120.74]  Verse 11
[5120.74 --> 5124.42]  He received circumcision as a sign and seal
[5124.42 --> 5125.74]  Of righteousness that he had by faith
[5125.74 --> 5127.26]  While he was still uncircumcised
[5127.26 --> 5130.62]  So then he is the father of all who believe
[5130.62 --> 5132.90]  But have not been circumcised
[5132.90 --> 5134.32]  All right?
[5134.36 --> 5135.26]  And we can go back here
[5135.26 --> 5137.20]  Remember chapter 4 is an example
[5137.20 --> 5138.80]  Of what he talked about in chapter 3
[5138.80 --> 5140.72]  And so chapter 3 verse 29
[5140.72 --> 5141.64]  Paul asks
[5141.64 --> 5143.88]  Is God the God of Jews only?
[5144.06 --> 5146.72]  Is he not the God of Gentiles too?
[5146.72 --> 5147.42]  Yes
[5147.42 --> 5150.56]  Of Gentiles too
[5150.56 --> 5155.64]  Having this faith
[5155.64 --> 5157.68]  Credit to you as righteousness
[5157.68 --> 5159.74]  Believing in this God
[5159.74 --> 5164.18]  Leads to belonging to his body
[5164.18 --> 5165.78]  To his people
[5165.78 --> 5167.64]  To his family
[5167.64 --> 5172.20]  The promise of justification by faith
[5172.20 --> 5172.66]  Right?
[5172.74 --> 5175.44]  Isn't just a doctrine for individual salvation
[5175.44 --> 5176.36]  Though it is that
[5176.36 --> 5180.82]  But it is also for the community of faith
[5180.82 --> 5184.52]  This imputed righteousness to the individual
[5184.52 --> 5188.68]  Comes with a community to belong in
[5188.68 --> 5191.68]  And so when we together are called
[5191.68 --> 5193.08]  To work out our salvation
[5193.08 --> 5194.26]  With fear and trembling
[5194.26 --> 5196.84]  To wrestle with the truths of who God is
[5196.84 --> 5198.82]  And the way that we see or don't see
[5198.82 --> 5200.82]  Or struggle to see God at work in the world
[5200.82 --> 5203.32]  We do so together
[5203.32 --> 5206.76]  We do so as a family
[5206.76 --> 5210.54]  Who never has to walk alone
[5210.54 --> 5214.00]  But who walks with God
[5214.00 --> 5216.52]  And who walks with our brothers and sisters
[5216.52 --> 5217.98]  In faith
[5217.98 --> 5220.98]  The faith that unites us to Jesus
[5220.98 --> 5224.10]  Is the faith that unites us to each other
[5224.10 --> 5225.62]  And again next week at the table
[5225.62 --> 5227.96]  We will see that so clearly
[5227.96 --> 5230.96]  Simultaneously in that moment
[5230.96 --> 5233.90]  We are being united to Jesus and each other
[5233.90 --> 5238.40]  This is our faith
[5238.40 --> 5241.98]  To trust in who God is
[5241.98 --> 5243.78]  What he has done in Jesus Christ
[5243.78 --> 5246.20]  And the promise of the gospel
[5246.20 --> 5249.38]  As you go into this week
[5249.38 --> 5252.70]  Go held by that truth
[5252.70 --> 5255.14]  And go that you might see the world
[5255.14 --> 5258.62]  Believing who God is
[5258.62 --> 5263.14]  Because that is an unstoppable movement of God
[5263.14 --> 5264.60]  In the world
[5264.60 --> 5265.80]  That will start here
[5265.80 --> 5267.98]  As he goes with you
[5267.98 --> 5268.56]  Amen?
[5268.56 --> 5270.32]  Let's pray together
[5270.32 --> 5274.72]  Lord our good
[5274.72 --> 5276.52]  Glorious God
[5276.52 --> 5279.84]  We praise your name
[5279.84 --> 5282.46]  For the gift of faith
[5282.46 --> 5285.04]  We praise your name
[5285.04 --> 5287.58]  For the gift of your gospel
[5287.58 --> 5290.02]  That we might see Jesus Christ
[5290.02 --> 5290.74]  More clearly
[5290.74 --> 5292.20]  That we might know the promises
[5292.20 --> 5293.62]  Of your salvation
[5293.62 --> 5294.70]  More deeply
[5294.70 --> 5297.12]  In the depths of our heart
[5297.12 --> 5299.34]  And we thank you
[5299.34 --> 5299.88]  Lord God
[5299.88 --> 5301.36]  That as we believe
[5301.36 --> 5303.38]  We belong to you
[5303.38 --> 5304.66]  And to each other
[5304.66 --> 5305.96]  And so we go
[5305.96 --> 5308.32]  In the power of your Holy Spirit
[5308.32 --> 5310.20]  And we go in the fellowship
[5310.20 --> 5311.98]  Of believers
[5311.98 --> 5315.38]  In Jesus name we pray
[5315.38 --> 5316.84]  All God's people said
[5316.84 --> 5318.00]  Amen
[5318.00 --> 5318.14]  Amen
[5318.14 --> 5342.14]  What is our hope
[5342.14 --> 5344.18]  In life and death
[5344.18 --> 5346.32]  Christ alone
[5346.32 --> 5348.68]  Christ alone
[5348.68 --> 5352.78]  What is our only confidence
[5352.78 --> 5358.24]  That our souls belong to love
[5358.24 --> 5362.80]  Who holds our deeds within our hand
[5362.80 --> 5366.80]  What comes upon from his command
[5366.80 --> 5372.04]  And what will keep us to the end
[5372.04 --> 5374.62]  The love of Christ
[5374.62 --> 5377.24]  In which we stand
[5377.24 --> 5383.44]  Oh sing hallelujah
[5383.44 --> 5388.00]  Our hope springs eternal
[5388.00 --> 5392.44]  Oh sing hallelujah
[5392.44 --> 5396.44]  Now and ever we confess
[5396.44 --> 5401.04]  Christ our hope in life and death
[5401.04 --> 5411.42]  What truth can calm the troubled soul
[5411.42 --> 5414.04]  God is good
[5414.04 --> 5415.90]  God is good
[5415.90 --> 5420.38]  Where is his grace and goodness known
[5420.38 --> 5424.90]  In our great redeemer's blood
[5424.90 --> 5429.38]  Who holds our faith when fears arise
[5429.38 --> 5433.80]  Who stands above the stormy trial
[5433.80 --> 5438.32]  Who sends the waves that bring us time
[5438.32 --> 5443.10]  Unto the shore the rock of Christ
[5443.10 --> 5447.52]  Oh sing hallelujah
[5447.52 --> 5451.56]  Our hope springs eternal
[5451.56 --> 5455.92]  Oh sing hallelujah
[5455.92 --> 5459.10]  Now and ever we confess
[5459.10 --> 5464.10]  Christ our hope in life and death
[5464.10 --> 5465.10]  Christ he lives
[5465.10 --> 5477.10]  Christ he lives
[5477.10 --> 5479.10]  Christ he lives
[5479.10 --> 5483.48]  And what reward will heaven bring
[5483.48 --> 5488.10]  Everlasting life within
[5488.10 --> 5493.10]  There we will rise to meet the Lord
[5493.10 --> 5497.10]  Then sin and death will be destroyed
[5497.10 --> 5499.10]  And we will be destroyed
[5499.10 --> 5501.10]  And we will be in endless joy
[5501.10 --> 5502.10]  When Christ is ours forevermore
[5502.10 --> 5506.10]  When Christ is ours forevermore
[5506.10 --> 5508.10]  Oh sing
[5508.10 --> 5509.10]  Oh sing
[5509.10 --> 5513.10]  Oh sing hallelujah
[5513.10 --> 5517.10]  Our hope springs eternal
[5517.10 --> 5518.10]  Oh sing hallelujah
[5518.10 --> 5525.10]  Now and ever we confess
[5525.10 --> 5529.10]  Christ our hope in life and death
[5529.10 --> 5533.10]  Oh sing hallelujah
[5533.10 --> 5534.10]  Hallelujah
[5534.10 --> 5535.10]  Our hope springs eternal
[5535.10 --> 5537.10]  Our hope springs eternal
[5537.10 --> 5538.10]  Oh sing hallelujah
[5538.10 --> 5539.10]  Oh sing hallelujah
[5539.10 --> 5540.10]  Now and ever we confess
[5540.10 --> 5544.10]  Christ our hope in life and death
[5544.10 --> 5545.10]  Christ our hope in life and death
[5545.10 --> 5546.10]  Now and ever we confess
[5546.10 --> 5552.10]  Christ our hope in life and death
[5552.10 --> 5553.10]  Now and ever we confess
[5553.10 --> 5558.10]  Christ our hope in life and death
[5570.10 --> 5573.10]  Following our worship together this morning
[5573.10 --> 5577.10]  We continue experiencing the union of the fellowship
[5577.10 --> 5579.10]  As we have coffee and refreshments together
[5579.10 --> 5582.10]  Invite you to stick around for that
[5582.10 --> 5584.10]  Perhaps take a risk and talk to someone new
[5584.10 --> 5586.10]  Or someone who you don't know
[5586.10 --> 5590.10]  We're grateful for lots of visitors in these last while
[5590.10 --> 5593.10]  We want to make sure that we can grab you and connect with you
[5593.10 --> 5596.10]  If you are visiting there are connect cards available in your seats
[5596.10 --> 5598.10]  Or there's a QR code you can scan
[5598.10 --> 5599.10]  We'd love to hear from you
[5599.10 --> 5602.10]  And then lastly if you would like prayer this morning
[5602.10 --> 5605.10]  There is someone who is available
[5605.10 --> 5606.10]  They're wearing a name tag
[5606.10 --> 5607.10]  It has a yellow box on it
[5607.10 --> 5609.10]  They would love to pray with you
[5609.10 --> 5612.10]  One of them for sure will be up here following the service
[5612.10 --> 5617.10]  And so we invite you to grab them for prayer there
[5617.10 --> 5623.10]  As we go this week go with the blessing of our God
[5623.10 --> 5628.10]  The Lord bless you and keep you
[5628.10 --> 5631.10]  The Lord make his face to shine upon you
[5631.10 --> 5634.10]  And be gracious to you
[5634.10 --> 5637.10]  The Lord turn his face toward you
[5637.10 --> 5640.10]  And give you his peace
[5640.10 --> 5642.10]  Amen
[5642.10 --> 5645.10]  We receive your blessing we receive your praise
