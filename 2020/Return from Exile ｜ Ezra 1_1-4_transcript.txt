[0.00 --> 9.20]  It is good to be back in the sanctuary again, isn't it?
[10.40 --> 14.16]  Brothers and sisters, both here and those of you who are joining us online,
[14.96 --> 16.58]  it is a strange Sunday, though.
[17.34 --> 20.80]  As good as it is to be back, we're not back as we should be.
[21.56 --> 22.56]  And that's strange.
[23.24 --> 26.12]  We celebrate, and yet we maybe mourn a little bit.
[27.08 --> 32.10]  Several of us leaders, of Emmanuel's leaders, got together to plan this upcoming season
[32.10 --> 34.44]  that we find ourselves in as restrictions have been lifted.
[34.82 --> 38.70]  And one of the things that was discussed was this actual Sunday service,
[38.78 --> 39.64]  this one we're in right now.
[41.12 --> 42.78]  We didn't know what the vibe was going to be.
[43.20 --> 47.00]  We weren't sure if we should be celebrating that we can come back together
[47.00 --> 49.54]  or lamenting that not everybody is here.
[49.54 --> 55.42]  We didn't know if this would be a joyous Sunday because we're back in the sanctuary
[55.42 --> 58.06]  or a hard Sunday because we're missing some faces.
[58.20 --> 61.04]  Should we celebrate the fact that we have this technology
[61.04 --> 63.88]  that we can come together as a whole body of Christ?
[64.92 --> 68.18]  Or should we be mourning various losses that maybe we have gone through
[68.18 --> 70.62]  over these past several weeks and months?
[71.28 --> 77.48]  On top of that, with inequality and injustice on the forefronts of people's minds right now
[77.48 --> 80.10]  due to the events that are happening both in the States and in Canada
[80.10 --> 82.12]  with race, with hate.
[82.60 --> 86.70]  How do we bring love to this culture that is so very divided?
[87.38 --> 89.88]  And it goes beyond the division of race that we see,
[90.36 --> 92.96]  but it's this division of political worldviews,
[93.52 --> 97.46]  the division of how to solve some of these problems within the systems we find ourselves in,
[97.52 --> 103.22]  and just this growing false narrative that is continuing on,
[103.22 --> 109.30]  and this idea, this false idea that if we don't believe the same thing as our neighbors,
[109.40 --> 110.76]  we must fear or hate them.
[112.02 --> 116.56]  And that false narrative that is digging deeper and deeper into our culture,
[116.56 --> 121.60]  it continues to make the division wider and wider and that chasm greater.
[123.24 --> 127.36]  And yet we can gather together and be here, and that is good.
[127.36 --> 132.46]  We're called to rejoice when others rejoice and mourn when others mourn,
[132.50 --> 139.66]  but in this current context, how do we rejoice and mourn and celebrate and lament at the same time?
[140.30 --> 143.00]  What are we to do here today?
[144.54 --> 151.24]  Where is the hope in the midst of this sorrow and joy and just overall strangeness?
[151.24 --> 157.18]  What we can do, brothers and sisters, is we can open up the Word.
[157.38 --> 162.16]  We can open up the Word of God, because in the Word of God, there is truth.
[163.30 --> 168.42]  We believe that our only comfort in life and in death is that we belong both body and soul to Jesus Christ.
[168.72 --> 173.28]  Well, this book is His Word to us, and this is where we will find the truth.
[173.60 --> 180.42]  This is where we will find what we need to go through what is happening today in all our lives,
[180.42 --> 184.02]  be it good, be it bad, be it hard, be it comforting.
[185.62 --> 190.16]  One of the best things we can do is listen right now, but it depends on who we listen to.
[190.74 --> 194.26]  And first and foremost, we need to listen to Christ.
[194.48 --> 196.02]  We need to listen to Him first.
[197.92 --> 202.76]  And so I picked a passage today that I believe has some parallels to our current context.
[204.24 --> 208.16]  And so we're going to open up the Word of God, and I invite you to pull out your Bibles if you've got them with you today.
[208.16 --> 211.50]  Today, we're going to open up the Word of God and look at a passage in Ezra.
[211.68 --> 215.32]  We're going to be reading the first four verses in Ezra together.
[215.78 --> 217.82]  And so at home, please pull out your Bibles as well.
[217.90 --> 221.62]  Now, before we quickly look into it, before we look into these first four verses,
[222.36 --> 224.66]  here's why I thought this passage applies to us today.
[225.72 --> 231.88]  See, Ezra is a book all about the exiled Jewish people being allowed in limited capacity
[231.88 --> 234.46]  to go back to Jerusalem to rebuild their temple.
[234.46 --> 240.50]  And of course, today, here we are, allowed to come back into the sanctuary in a limited capacity.
[241.54 --> 246.90]  In Ezra, these Jewish people were subjects of unjust and an oppressive nation in Babylon.
[247.16 --> 252.76]  And today, oppression and injustice are needing a ton of discussion where we find ourselves.
[254.40 --> 258.76]  In Ezra, the Israelites, they just spent 70 years in exile in Babylon.
[258.76 --> 264.30]  And today, we have just spent the last three months in this sort of soft isolation on our couches.
[264.54 --> 269.66]  So the parallel isn't quite perfect necessarily, but I think it's close enough that we can open up our Bibles today.
[269.72 --> 273.68]  So please, read with me these first four verses found in Ezra chapter 1.
[273.68 --> 294.20]  This is what the king of Persia says.
[294.20 --> 300.82]  The Lord, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth,
[300.94 --> 307.16]  and he has appointed me to build a temple for him at Jerusalem in Judah.
[308.10 --> 314.10]  Any of his people among you may go up to Jerusalem in Judah and build the temple of the Lord, the God of Israel,
[314.30 --> 318.48]  the God who is in Jerusalem, and may their God be with them.
[318.48 --> 326.50]  And in any locality where survivors may now be living, the people are to provide them with silver and gold,
[326.58 --> 332.88]  with goods and livestocks, and with freewill offerings for the temple of God in Jerusalem.
[334.08 --> 335.38]  This is the word of the Lord.
[337.94 --> 345.30]  Now to start, I'm going to power through an obnoxiously quick history lesson to put this passage into context.
[345.30 --> 349.98]  Okay, so way back in 1 Kings, Israel wanted kings.
[350.64 --> 351.96]  And so God gave them Saul.
[352.06 --> 356.36]  But God's warning was, you need to remain faithful to me, or you will, in essence, be conquered.
[357.14 --> 361.28]  Well, Saul was their king, and after Saul came David, and after David came Solomon,
[361.40 --> 362.98]  and after Solomon came Rehoboam.
[363.26 --> 367.88]  And when Rehoboam was king, the nation was already on this terribly sinful trajectory.
[368.60 --> 372.38]  In fact, when Rehoboam was king, the kingdom of Israel divided into two parts.
[372.38 --> 376.42]  You had the northern kingdom of Israel, and you had the southern kingdom of Judah.
[376.90 --> 382.06]  In the northern kingdom of Israel, in the following years, they had 19 kings in succession.
[382.98 --> 386.52]  All 19 of those kings were terrible.
[387.22 --> 392.36]  They were just super evil, idol-worshiping, fanatically wicked kings.
[392.36 --> 398.16]  And in 721 BC, Assyria came in and just wiped them out.
[399.08 --> 400.14]  Just took them over.
[402.16 --> 406.24]  Meanwhile, during all of this, the southern kingdom of Judah, they had kings too.
[406.34 --> 407.98]  They had 20 kings in succession.
[408.56 --> 409.56]  They did a little bit better.
[410.24 --> 413.76]  They had eight kings that God said were good in the eyes of the Lord.
[413.76 --> 418.00]  But yet, eight kings out of 20 still is not that good of a percentage.
[418.46 --> 423.92]  And in 605 BC, Babylon comes in and conquers Judah as well.
[424.58 --> 427.78]  Takes all of the people of Judah into exile.
[428.94 --> 430.42]  This time to the Babylonians.
[430.80 --> 434.46]  So the Jews, they are in exile for 70 years.
[434.98 --> 437.18]  And in those 70 years, if you remember your Bibles,
[437.26 --> 440.64]  you get stories like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego being thrown into the furnace.
[440.64 --> 443.64]  And you get the whole book of Daniel and the whole book of Ezekiel.
[443.76 --> 447.12]  All of that happens in the 70-year time when they are in exile.
[448.04 --> 450.14]  And now, we're landing the history lesson here.
[450.78 --> 454.24]  But after 70 years in exile, Persia comes along.
[454.66 --> 455.88]  And they conquer Babylon.
[457.32 --> 458.60]  And then we get to our text.
[459.10 --> 460.44]  After Persia takes over,
[461.02 --> 464.74]  some Jewish people, that they can return to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple.
[465.44 --> 467.06]  And that was our text today.
[467.06 --> 472.44]  That's a crazy story, if you think about it.
[472.72 --> 475.06]  God's people, they're in exile for 70 years.
[475.36 --> 477.06]  They've been thrown into fiery furnaces.
[477.40 --> 479.10]  They've been chucked into lion's dens.
[479.52 --> 483.08]  And then, the Babylonians, who have been tormenting them for 70 years,
[483.18 --> 484.66]  they get overrun by Persia.
[485.52 --> 486.56]  And the king of Persia,
[487.10 --> 489.54]  all of a sudden, for really no reason at all,
[489.88 --> 491.32]  he says, eh, go home.
[491.92 --> 492.68]  It's fine.
[493.90 --> 495.00]  You know what? Just go home.
[495.00 --> 497.56]  And, you know what? Build a temple for that god that you worship.
[497.64 --> 498.22]  He'd like that.
[498.56 --> 499.78]  He seems like a cool god.
[500.64 --> 501.54]  Build a temple for him.
[501.56 --> 503.50]  You know what? Take my gold and silver, too.
[503.56 --> 504.14]  That will help.
[506.02 --> 507.76]  Think about that. That is fascinating.
[508.28 --> 509.92]  The Persians were not God's people.
[511.08 --> 513.68]  Cyrus was not worshipping Yahweh in any means.
[515.24 --> 517.90]  Cyrus gains absolutely nothing by doing this.
[517.90 --> 522.52]  In fact, he risks losing the loyalty of his own people
[522.52 --> 524.74]  by releasing the Jews back to Jerusalem.
[525.58 --> 528.18]  This was not a normal practice for kings
[528.18 --> 530.28]  in the conquering of all nations business.
[532.44 --> 533.46]  But it happens.
[535.16 --> 537.38]  So why does Cyrus make this proclamation?
[537.66 --> 540.64]  Why does he decree that the Jewish people can go back
[540.64 --> 541.76]  and build this temple?
[541.76 --> 544.90]  And how does this relate to us right now, where we are?
[546.98 --> 548.32]  Well, let's look at three truths
[548.32 --> 550.52]  that come out of this passage here in Ezra,
[550.56 --> 552.94]  in this event in the history of the Israelites
[552.94 --> 554.60]  and the history of the planet.
[555.74 --> 557.06]  The first truth is this.
[557.74 --> 559.48]  God is sovereign.
[560.74 --> 562.70]  He is in control of all things.
[562.70 --> 567.60]  He even uses people and places and situations
[567.60 --> 575.36]  that seem unusable in order to fulfill his works,
[575.54 --> 579.14]  in order to fulfill his purposes for his people.
[579.24 --> 580.88]  Notice the first verse of our text.
[581.24 --> 585.18]  The Lord moved the heart of King Cyrus,
[585.62 --> 587.84]  king of Persia, to make a proclamation in the realm.
[588.04 --> 591.64]  The Lord moved Cyrus' heart.
[592.86 --> 594.00]  The ESV says it this way.
[594.00 --> 597.58]  The Lord stirred in the heart of King Cyrus.
[597.60 --> 601.24]  The original Hebrew word there,
[601.34 --> 602.38]  the word for moved or stirred,
[602.62 --> 603.64]  it means to awaken.
[604.64 --> 607.48]  So God awoke Cyrus to his plan.
[607.62 --> 610.52]  God awoke his sovereignty to Cyrus.
[611.34 --> 612.74]  And Cyrus had to act on it.
[614.68 --> 617.08]  The hand of the Lord can reach from anywhere,
[617.42 --> 619.58]  through anyone, and do anything.
[620.18 --> 624.78]  He is in control of this world.
[624.78 --> 627.86]  In fact, this is fascinating,
[628.24 --> 630.88]  about 150 years before this happened,
[631.36 --> 634.10]  150 years before Cyrus made this proclamation,
[634.80 --> 637.80]  the prophet Isaiah prophesied all of it.
[638.48 --> 639.56]  Now I have to highlight this
[639.56 --> 641.32]  because it might seem confusing in your Bibles.
[641.68 --> 642.90]  Even though the book of Isaiah
[642.90 --> 645.20]  comes after the book of Ezra in your Bibles,
[645.80 --> 648.28]  the events of Isaiah happened beforehand.
[648.90 --> 649.50]  The Bible's not,
[649.58 --> 651.74]  the Old Testament's not in chronological order that way.
[651.74 --> 655.90]  So Isaiah comes along 150 years before this event,
[656.06 --> 658.34]  about 80 years before they're even in exile.
[660.14 --> 661.28]  And he predicts this.
[661.36 --> 662.20]  He prophesies this.
[662.26 --> 663.80]  In Isaiah 45, we read this,
[663.88 --> 665.46]  and I'm going to condense it a little bit,
[665.48 --> 667.08]  but this is what Isaiah 45 says.
[667.36 --> 668.86]  Feel free to open it and follow along.
[669.72 --> 670.56]  Isaiah 45 says,
[670.56 --> 672.98]  This is what the Lord says to his anointed,
[673.74 --> 674.36]  to Cyrus,
[675.00 --> 677.14]  whose right hand I will take hold of
[677.14 --> 679.72]  to subdue nations before him
[679.72 --> 681.90]  and to strip kings of their armor.
[682.26 --> 684.30]  I will go before you, says the Lord,
[684.62 --> 685.84]  so that you may know
[685.84 --> 688.38]  that I am the Lord, the God,
[688.72 --> 689.94]  the God of Israel.
[690.34 --> 692.62]  I summon you, Cyrus,
[692.98 --> 694.28]  by name
[694.28 --> 696.70]  and bestow on you a title of honor,
[696.70 --> 700.42]  though you do not acknowledge me,
[701.14 --> 703.60]  I am the Lord and there is no other.
[706.34 --> 707.80]  150 years before this,
[707.84 --> 709.04]  Cyrus isn't even alive yet.
[710.30 --> 711.46]  And God is saying,
[712.10 --> 713.82]  even though Cyrus isn't alive yet,
[714.06 --> 716.08]  and even though he will not acknowledge me,
[716.56 --> 718.46]  the Lord, the sovereign God of all things,
[718.54 --> 719.92]  I will work through him
[719.92 --> 723.00]  to start rebuilding God's temple.
[723.00 --> 727.92]  Way before any of this ever took place,
[728.48 --> 729.48]  God was in control.
[729.80 --> 730.82]  God is above all.
[731.34 --> 731.98]  He is in all.
[732.08 --> 733.20]  He works through all.
[733.32 --> 735.94]  He rules over his people at all times.
[737.06 --> 739.28]  He has control over the universe,
[739.92 --> 742.34]  even if it seems like things are falling apart.
[743.78 --> 746.88]  Whether you're in the middle of a time in exile
[746.88 --> 749.34]  or in the middle of a pandemic.
[749.34 --> 752.34]  He was there for Israel
[752.34 --> 754.20]  when they were slaves in a foreign land,
[754.26 --> 755.12]  when they were oppressed.
[756.60 --> 757.82]  He is for us.
[757.94 --> 758.80]  He is for all,
[758.90 --> 761.42]  even if we are feeling oppressed
[761.42 --> 762.30]  or powerless
[762.30 --> 764.58]  in this land that we are in right now.
[764.66 --> 767.16]  It is God who is over all of it.
[768.08 --> 769.14]  God who brings hope.
[769.32 --> 772.06]  God who is sovereign over everything.
[774.96 --> 776.30]  Some of you may be experiencing
[776.30 --> 779.02]  this truth powerfully today.
[780.34 --> 781.70]  Others may not be.
[783.78 --> 785.66]  But when we look at this text,
[786.10 --> 787.24]  let me encourage you.
[787.90 --> 790.14]  Let me encourage you all to understand
[790.14 --> 792.46]  the magnitude of God's power
[792.46 --> 795.22]  and the scope of his sovereign love
[795.22 --> 796.84]  for us all.
[796.98 --> 798.88]  Brothers, sisters, friends,
[799.44 --> 800.38]  God's got you.
[801.86 --> 803.18]  That's truth number one.
[803.18 --> 807.44]  The second truth is that God keeps his promises.
[808.12 --> 810.18]  In both the books of Isaiah and Jeremiah,
[810.82 --> 812.54]  we know that this is true.
[813.88 --> 816.40]  God promised that he would bring his people back
[816.40 --> 817.38]  to his homeland
[817.38 --> 819.82]  through both of those prophets.
[819.96 --> 820.82]  In Jeremiah, actually,
[820.98 --> 822.12]  this text references it.
[822.50 --> 824.28]  In Ezra 1 verse 1,
[824.44 --> 825.40]  it references this.
[826.32 --> 828.86]  And it references Jeremiah 29 verse 10
[828.86 --> 829.84]  where God says,
[830.44 --> 832.66]  when 70 years are completed for Babylon,
[833.18 --> 834.34]  I will visit you
[834.34 --> 837.38]  and keep my good promise to you,
[837.96 --> 839.74]  causing you to return to this place.
[841.86 --> 842.94]  God promises,
[843.26 --> 843.96]  and then he delivers.
[843.96 --> 848.16]  But I do bet a lot of the people of Judah,
[848.28 --> 849.06]  they would have lost hope.
[849.16 --> 850.86]  70 years is a long time.
[851.38 --> 853.08]  That is a long time to be in exile.
[854.48 --> 855.48]  Psalm 137,
[855.62 --> 856.46]  whose scholars agree,
[856.56 --> 857.34]  was probably written
[857.34 --> 858.88]  while they were in captivity in Babylon.
[859.02 --> 859.52]  It says this.
[860.34 --> 861.30]  Psalm 137 says,
[861.40 --> 862.58]  By the rivers of Babylon
[862.58 --> 864.52]  we sat and wept
[864.52 --> 866.34]  when we remembered Zion.
[867.34 --> 869.42]  On the poplars we hung our harps,
[869.50 --> 870.46]  for there our captives
[870.46 --> 871.66]  asked us for songs.
[871.66 --> 875.30]  Our tormentors demanded songs of joy.
[875.38 --> 875.76]  They said,
[876.24 --> 877.96]  Sing us one of the songs of Zion.
[880.48 --> 882.44]  How can we sing the songs of the Lord
[882.44 --> 883.68]  while we are in a foreign land?
[885.80 --> 887.02]  God's people were worried
[887.02 --> 887.94]  that he had left them.
[888.94 --> 890.52]  But God keeps his promises.
[891.90 --> 892.70]  He promised Noah
[892.70 --> 894.64]  he would never destroy the world again
[894.64 --> 896.52]  to rid it of sin.
[897.12 --> 897.76]  And he delivered.
[898.44 --> 899.84]  He promised to give Abraham
[899.84 --> 901.42]  more descendants than the stars.
[901.42 --> 902.06]  And he delivered.
[902.28 --> 903.88]  He promised he would deliver
[903.88 --> 905.32]  the Israelites from Egypt.
[905.48 --> 906.24]  And he delivered.
[906.44 --> 908.08]  He promised he would deliver Judah
[908.08 --> 909.38]  from his captives in Babylon
[909.38 --> 911.24]  through a king named Cyrus.
[911.58 --> 912.58]  And he delivered.
[914.40 --> 917.68]  And time and time again
[917.68 --> 919.36]  throughout the whole Old Testament
[919.36 --> 923.20]  he promised a Messiah would come
[923.20 --> 925.28]  to save us from the weight
[925.28 --> 926.26]  of sin and death.
[926.26 --> 928.52]  And he delivered.
[929.72 --> 930.96]  He delivered his son
[930.96 --> 932.18]  to die for us all.
[934.78 --> 936.72]  Something we will once again remember
[936.72 --> 937.86]  as we partake in communion
[937.86 --> 938.80]  in just a few moments.
[940.60 --> 942.10]  God promised his spirit
[942.10 --> 944.04]  to all who believe.
[944.72 --> 946.16]  And he delivered that too.
[947.60 --> 949.32]  And he promised to be with us always
[949.32 --> 951.38]  to the very end of the age.
[951.38 --> 955.20]  God keeps his promise.
[957.66 --> 959.38]  No matter where we are in life today
[959.38 --> 960.50]  no matter what is happening
[960.50 --> 961.16]  in this world
[961.16 --> 961.96]  in your life
[961.96 --> 963.18]  or in the world around you
[963.18 --> 963.56]  remember
[963.56 --> 966.22]  God keeps his promises.
[966.52 --> 967.70]  He's promised to be with you.
[968.12 --> 968.98]  He is with you.
[969.34 --> 970.12]  You are not alone.
[970.94 --> 971.74]  So God is sovereign.
[972.16 --> 973.14]  God keeps his promises.
[973.74 --> 974.32]  And thirdly
[974.32 --> 976.82]  God provides for his people.
[976.82 --> 977.64]  The final verse
[977.64 --> 979.02]  of this text highlights this.
[980.44 --> 981.96]  The final verse says this.
[982.84 --> 983.72]  And in any locality
[983.72 --> 985.26]  where survivors may now be living
[985.26 --> 986.92]  the people are to provide them
[986.92 --> 988.32]  with silver and gold
[988.32 --> 989.52]  with goods and livestock
[989.52 --> 991.24]  and with free will offerings
[991.24 --> 993.02]  for the temple of God
[993.02 --> 994.04]  in Jerusalem.
[995.24 --> 996.28]  So not only did God
[996.28 --> 997.40]  provide the Jewish people
[997.40 --> 998.34]  with their land back
[998.34 --> 999.62]  but through Cyrus
[999.62 --> 1001.22]  they also left with tons
[1001.22 --> 1002.78]  of provisions as well.
[1003.40 --> 1004.46]  If you were to keep reading
[1004.46 --> 1005.04]  in Ezra 1
[1005.04 --> 1006.42]  if you get to verses 9 and 11
[1006.42 --> 1007.50]  you get to see
[1007.50 --> 1008.94]  everything that they were
[1008.94 --> 1010.02]  that they took with them
[1010.02 --> 1010.94]  that Cyrus gave them.
[1011.34 --> 1013.48]  It came up to 5,400 articles
[1013.48 --> 1014.50]  pots, pans, dishes
[1014.50 --> 1016.26]  of gold and silver
[1016.26 --> 1017.24]  with them.
[1018.64 --> 1019.48]  Going back home
[1019.48 --> 1020.04]  is one thing.
[1020.68 --> 1021.28]  Going back home
[1021.28 --> 1022.26]  with everything you need
[1022.26 --> 1023.58]  to start rebuilding a temple
[1023.58 --> 1025.02]  and rebuilding a society
[1025.02 --> 1026.48]  is another.
[1031.26 --> 1032.58]  God knew what his people needed
[1032.58 --> 1034.20]  to fulfill his purposes for them
[1034.20 --> 1035.82]  and he provided it for them.
[1035.82 --> 1037.10]  Now to be clear
[1037.10 --> 1038.88]  this is not a prosperity gospel.
[1039.22 --> 1040.30]  This is not a text
[1040.30 --> 1041.48]  about simply asking
[1041.48 --> 1042.18]  for what you want
[1042.18 --> 1042.62]  hard enough
[1042.62 --> 1043.20]  and getting it.
[1043.26 --> 1044.12]  That is not what Ezra
[1044.12 --> 1044.64]  is getting at.
[1044.82 --> 1045.56]  That is not the truth
[1045.56 --> 1046.16]  of this text.
[1046.52 --> 1047.26]  The Jewish people
[1047.26 --> 1048.22]  needed gold and silver
[1048.22 --> 1049.18]  in order to go
[1049.18 --> 1050.40]  and fulfill God's promises
[1050.40 --> 1051.38]  of rebuilding the temple
[1051.38 --> 1052.72]  so God gave it to them.
[1053.16 --> 1053.98]  Chances are many of us
[1053.98 --> 1055.74]  do not need 5,400 articles
[1055.74 --> 1056.68]  of gold and silver
[1056.68 --> 1057.34]  plates and dishes
[1057.34 --> 1058.38]  to be able to fulfill
[1058.38 --> 1059.04]  God's promises
[1059.04 --> 1059.66]  in this world
[1059.66 --> 1060.52]  that we are in right now.
[1060.66 --> 1061.56]  So that is not the point
[1061.56 --> 1062.12]  of this text.
[1062.12 --> 1065.32]  However, God does provide
[1065.32 --> 1066.36]  whatever you need
[1066.36 --> 1068.18]  to fulfill his plans
[1068.18 --> 1069.62]  for you personally
[1069.62 --> 1070.82]  in this world.
[1071.52 --> 1072.62]  He also gives
[1072.62 --> 1073.60]  what we need
[1073.60 --> 1074.52]  as a church
[1074.52 --> 1076.34]  to function as his body
[1076.34 --> 1077.82]  here in Langley, B.C.
[1077.82 --> 1082.20]  Now, I'm going to linger
[1082.20 --> 1083.52]  on finances for a second
[1083.52 --> 1084.24]  and then I'm going
[1084.24 --> 1084.92]  to move on to them
[1084.92 --> 1087.16]  because this is not a text
[1087.16 --> 1088.20]  simply about finances
[1088.20 --> 1089.44]  but there is a really
[1089.44 --> 1090.18]  sweet example
[1090.18 --> 1090.90]  about how God
[1090.90 --> 1092.04]  has been working
[1092.04 --> 1092.80]  in this church
[1092.80 --> 1094.46]  that we need to celebrate today.
[1094.98 --> 1095.98]  When this pandemic
[1095.98 --> 1096.68]  hit in March,
[1096.92 --> 1097.78]  many of us
[1097.78 --> 1099.12]  were praying for each other
[1099.12 --> 1100.06]  because we were worried
[1100.06 --> 1100.86]  about how it was going
[1100.86 --> 1101.90]  to affect our lives.
[1102.00 --> 1102.62]  Eric mentioned this
[1102.62 --> 1103.18]  in his prayer.
[1103.76 --> 1104.36]  We weren't sure
[1104.36 --> 1105.76]  what our job situations
[1105.76 --> 1106.20]  were going to be.
[1106.20 --> 1106.70]  We weren't sure
[1106.70 --> 1108.06]  what our financial situations
[1108.06 --> 1108.56]  were going to be
[1108.56 --> 1109.52]  or our livelihoods.
[1109.94 --> 1110.44]  And so our church,
[1110.56 --> 1110.90]  we were praying
[1110.90 --> 1111.44]  for each other.
[1111.80 --> 1112.70]  We prayed and feared
[1112.70 --> 1113.56]  for people's jobs
[1113.56 --> 1114.88]  and for people's livelihoods
[1114.88 --> 1116.24]  but we were also concerned
[1116.24 --> 1117.76]  and praying for this church
[1117.76 --> 1118.98]  because we didn't know
[1118.98 --> 1119.60]  how all of that
[1119.60 --> 1121.48]  was going to affect us here.
[1121.90 --> 1122.44]  We didn't know
[1122.44 --> 1123.52]  how the church's budget
[1123.52 --> 1125.38]  was going to be affected.
[1125.64 --> 1126.66]  We were already behind
[1126.66 --> 1129.06]  and what was going to happen
[1129.06 --> 1129.68]  when this pandemic
[1129.68 --> 1130.36]  hit full force?
[1130.98 --> 1131.52]  How are we going
[1131.52 --> 1132.26]  to be able to hire
[1132.26 --> 1133.38]  a pastor, for example,
[1134.30 --> 1134.92]  once this hit?
[1134.92 --> 1136.10]  So we were praying.
[1136.18 --> 1136.64]  We were worried.
[1137.60 --> 1138.30]  But brothers and sisters,
[1138.40 --> 1139.40]  over the last three months,
[1139.62 --> 1140.38]  not only have people
[1140.38 --> 1140.96]  kept giving,
[1141.70 --> 1142.70]  giving has gone up
[1142.70 --> 1144.66]  in the last three months
[1144.66 --> 1145.58]  to this church.
[1146.54 --> 1148.10]  Your generosity has helped us
[1148.10 --> 1149.16]  through a very hard time.
[1149.40 --> 1150.36]  It's actually allowed us
[1150.36 --> 1151.64]  to do some very cool things.
[1151.92 --> 1153.18]  Our deacons have taken on
[1153.18 --> 1154.38]  this very cool
[1154.38 --> 1155.52]  mercy ministry initiative
[1155.52 --> 1156.56]  with other churches
[1156.56 --> 1157.24]  around Langley
[1157.24 --> 1158.04]  called Hello Church
[1158.04 --> 1159.28]  where anybody in Langley
[1159.28 --> 1160.62]  can call or sign up
[1160.62 --> 1161.14]  on this number
[1161.14 --> 1161.66]  and a church
[1161.66 --> 1162.70]  will help support us.
[1162.76 --> 1163.46]  Our church is involved
[1163.46 --> 1163.80]  with that.
[1163.80 --> 1164.90]  We've been able
[1164.90 --> 1165.82]  to set up live streaming
[1165.82 --> 1166.54]  options right now
[1166.54 --> 1167.32]  so that we can gather
[1167.32 --> 1168.52]  in this church of 40 people
[1168.52 --> 1169.82]  but know that our whole body
[1169.82 --> 1170.72]  is watching with us
[1170.72 --> 1171.24]  at home.
[1172.12 --> 1172.98]  We are not worried
[1172.98 --> 1174.16]  about hiring a pastor later
[1174.16 --> 1174.98]  because the finances
[1174.98 --> 1175.48]  have come in
[1175.48 --> 1176.14]  and so hopefully later
[1176.14 --> 1177.06]  this year that will happen.
[1177.26 --> 1178.04]  And we have a bunch
[1178.04 --> 1179.10]  of new ministry initiatives
[1179.10 --> 1180.02]  happening in September
[1180.02 --> 1180.48]  as well,
[1180.60 --> 1181.60]  all because of
[1181.60 --> 1182.58]  your generosity.
[1182.92 --> 1184.10]  And while we can celebrate
[1184.10 --> 1185.54]  that and we can celebrate
[1185.54 --> 1186.20]  the generosity
[1186.20 --> 1186.74]  of the people
[1186.74 --> 1187.36]  of this church,
[1188.00 --> 1188.68]  brothers and sisters,
[1188.78 --> 1189.64]  let's remember this.
[1189.64 --> 1191.94]  It's the Holy Spirit
[1191.94 --> 1193.62]  working in our hearts
[1193.62 --> 1195.80]  making us generous,
[1196.04 --> 1198.08]  awakening us to give.
[1198.86 --> 1200.88]  This is God providing
[1200.88 --> 1202.58]  for our church.
[1203.02 --> 1204.16]  This is God providing
[1204.16 --> 1206.42]  for our brothers and sisters.
[1208.20 --> 1210.06]  And it goes way beyond finances.
[1211.72 --> 1213.76]  God provides what we need
[1213.76 --> 1215.90]  to get through difficult times.
[1215.90 --> 1218.76]  Just like He provided
[1218.76 --> 1219.36]  for the Jews
[1219.36 --> 1220.98]  when they returned to exile,
[1221.08 --> 1222.08]  He provides for us.
[1224.34 --> 1225.38]  Some of you may be needing
[1225.38 --> 1226.28]  some hope right now
[1226.28 --> 1227.94]  or peace.
[1229.30 --> 1230.70]  Some of us need to know
[1230.70 --> 1231.26]  we're not alone.
[1233.30 --> 1234.40]  Maybe you need comfort.
[1235.58 --> 1236.48]  Maybe you need support.
[1236.62 --> 1237.48]  Maybe you need community.
[1238.40 --> 1239.52]  We all need different things
[1239.52 --> 1240.22]  to be able to live
[1240.22 --> 1240.84]  in this life.
[1242.18 --> 1243.42]  And we need different things
[1243.42 --> 1244.30]  to be able to fulfill
[1244.30 --> 1245.10]  God's mandate
[1245.10 --> 1246.04]  for our lives,
[1246.06 --> 1246.98]  to love each other,
[1247.54 --> 1248.46]  to love everyone.
[1250.42 --> 1251.38]  God provides.
[1251.48 --> 1252.16]  What is it you need
[1252.16 --> 1252.88]  to be able to live
[1252.88 --> 1253.86]  that life of love
[1253.86 --> 1254.46]  for your neighbors,
[1254.58 --> 1255.00]  for each other?
[1255.06 --> 1255.80]  What do you need
[1255.80 --> 1256.86]  to be able to go out
[1256.86 --> 1257.84]  and take that next step?
[1258.68 --> 1259.66]  God provides.
[1259.82 --> 1260.60]  Pray for that.
[1262.10 --> 1262.90]  That's where God
[1262.90 --> 1264.80]  will be there in abundance.
[1266.20 --> 1266.80]  And of course,
[1267.14 --> 1268.50]  God's biggest provision
[1268.50 --> 1269.66]  for all of us
[1269.66 --> 1270.76]  was once again,
[1270.80 --> 1271.40]  it was His Son.
[1272.06 --> 1272.74]  It was His Son,
[1272.74 --> 1273.40]  Jesus Christ,
[1273.54 --> 1274.88]  who came into this world
[1274.88 --> 1276.14]  who died on the cross
[1276.14 --> 1277.74]  and offers us grace
[1277.74 --> 1278.44]  for our sins
[1278.44 --> 1279.48]  and eternal life
[1279.48 --> 1280.08]  if we believe.
[1280.92 --> 1281.70]  He frees us
[1281.70 --> 1282.44]  from the shackles
[1282.44 --> 1284.38]  of sin and of death.
[1284.44 --> 1285.24]  Listen to what Paul writes
[1285.24 --> 1286.46]  in Romans 8, verse 32.
[1287.30 --> 1287.70]  He says,
[1287.70 --> 1288.34]  the God,
[1288.34 --> 1289.66]  He who did not spare
[1289.66 --> 1290.80]  His own Son,
[1291.24 --> 1292.90]  but gave Him for us all,
[1293.96 --> 1294.76]  how will He
[1294.76 --> 1295.92]  not also,
[1296.58 --> 1297.34]  alone with Him,
[1297.84 --> 1298.98]  graciously give us
[1298.98 --> 1299.62]  all things?
[1301.60 --> 1302.76]  God gave us His Son
[1302.76 --> 1303.52]  as the ultimate
[1303.52 --> 1304.52]  freeing sacrifice
[1304.52 --> 1305.62]  for you.
[1306.24 --> 1307.68]  He provides for you.
[1309.44 --> 1310.62]  I want to close this sermon
[1310.62 --> 1311.12]  from a quote
[1311.12 --> 1312.18]  from author P. Williams.
[1313.72 --> 1314.64]  In his book,
[1314.64 --> 1316.12]  in his book
[1316.12 --> 1316.80]  Opening Ezra,
[1316.86 --> 1317.40]  he says this,
[1317.46 --> 1317.88]  and this is just
[1317.88 --> 1318.56]  a beautiful quote
[1318.56 --> 1319.26]  that sums this up.
[1319.32 --> 1319.66]  He says,
[1320.30 --> 1321.58]  Man cannot provide
[1321.58 --> 1322.56]  his own salvation.
[1322.74 --> 1323.84]  Only God can do that.
[1324.82 --> 1325.90]  In the cross of Jesus,
[1326.64 --> 1327.80]  life is provided
[1327.80 --> 1329.52]  in place of eternal damnation.
[1330.38 --> 1331.10]  And in addition
[1331.10 --> 1332.58]  to delivering up His Son,
[1333.44 --> 1334.98]  God will also freely
[1334.98 --> 1335.92]  provide us
[1335.92 --> 1337.26]  with all things,
[1337.34 --> 1337.74]  he says.
[1338.56 --> 1339.90]  The grace needed
[1339.90 --> 1340.68]  for each day,
[1341.68 --> 1342.34]  the strength
[1342.34 --> 1342.94]  to overcome
[1342.94 --> 1343.62]  our weaknesses
[1343.62 --> 1345.24]  and the power
