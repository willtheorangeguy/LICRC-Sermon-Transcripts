[0.00 --> 6.38]  This morning our scripture reading is going to be from Isaiah 60.
[6.88 --> 12.80]  We're going to read the first five verses of Isaiah 60, just the first five verses.
[13.30 --> 17.36]  If you have a Bible handy in front of you or with you or on your phone or whatever the
[17.36 --> 24.08]  case may be, I encourage you to open that up, turn it on, and read along with Isaiah 60.
[25.40 --> 26.64]  Hear the word of the Lord.
[26.64 --> 34.54]  Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord rises upon you.
[34.94 --> 40.04]  See, darkness covers the earth, and thick darkness is over the peoples, but the Lord
[40.04 --> 44.22]  rises upon you, and his glory appears over you.
[45.86 --> 50.40]  Nations will come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your dawn.
[51.60 --> 54.64]  Lift up your eyes and look about you.
[54.64 --> 57.26]  All assemble and come to you.
[57.36 --> 61.28]  Your sons come from afar, and your daughters are carried on the arm.
[62.68 --> 65.16]  Then you will look and be radiant.
[65.90 --> 69.76]  Your heart will throb and swell with joy.
[70.64 --> 71.84]  This is the word of the Lord.
[71.84 --> 82.04]  As we come to God's word, I thought I would begin this morning by throwing out the rules
[82.04 --> 90.04]  of what it means to be a new pastor in a new community, and to start with something incredibly
[90.04 --> 91.10]  controversial.
[91.10 --> 98.72]  I want to start this morning and talk to you about Christmas inflatables.
[101.26 --> 106.60]  Now, a number of years ago, when Christmas inflatables were just becoming a thing, they seem to have
[106.60 --> 111.64]  proliferated everywhere now, but when they were just becoming a thing, I remember in the weeks
[111.64 --> 116.94]  leading up to Christmas, I was walking through one of those big box stores with my family,
[116.94 --> 124.06]  and in the distance, I saw a kid come around the corner, and he looked up at the Christmas display,
[124.42 --> 125.30]  and he shouted,
[125.76 --> 126.24]  Mom!
[126.80 --> 128.84]  They have inflatables!
[128.84 --> 138.20]  And he ran straight over, and he just took them all in, glorying in the awe of a 10-foot-tall
[138.20 --> 144.92]  Santa standing beneath what would otherwise be a very dangerous thing to do, a giant reindeer,
[146.02 --> 150.60]  and just marveling and taking joy in that moment.
[150.60 --> 157.84]  Now, I get that Christmas inflatables may be divisive, and you probably have an opinion on them,
[157.90 --> 162.86]  but in that moment, that kid experienced pure joy.
[164.42 --> 169.04]  Now, fast forward a few years, and you see Christmas inflatables everywhere.
[170.10 --> 171.28]  It's almost old hat.
[172.34 --> 177.34]  I haven't seen someone get as excited as that kid did in that moment for quite some time,
[177.34 --> 182.42]  even when you go to the places that are absolutely over the top, and there's a few just around the corner from here.
[184.20 --> 187.62]  It just is what it is.
[188.98 --> 194.42]  I suspect for that kid, and for most of us, the joy of Christmas inflatables
[194.42 --> 197.14]  is a joy that fades,
[198.14 --> 201.74]  that eventually washes away.
[201.74 --> 208.14]  But on this third Sunday of Advent, I want us to think about a greater joy
[208.14 --> 210.86]  that all those lesser joys point to,
[211.10 --> 214.24]  a greater joy that will not spoil or fade.
[215.74 --> 218.32]  I want us to talk about what it means to have joy
[218.32 --> 220.12]  as Christians,
[220.86 --> 222.52]  especially in this season
[222.52 --> 225.28]  of darkness and trial.
[226.06 --> 228.18]  Now, here's what I want to suggest to you this morning,
[228.18 --> 231.86]  and I hope we can follow this line of thought through.
[232.62 --> 233.70]  For the Christian,
[233.88 --> 235.90]  that is for you and me who believe
[235.90 --> 237.02]  by grace through faith,
[237.16 --> 237.98]  for the Christian,
[238.56 --> 240.58]  joy is so much more
[240.58 --> 241.90]  than feeling happy
[241.90 --> 244.74]  or jolly or however it is you want to describe it.
[245.00 --> 245.78]  For the Christian,
[246.20 --> 248.14]  joy, and what I want to suggest to you,
[248.26 --> 249.82]  is best understood
[249.82 --> 251.96]  as deep down
[251.96 --> 254.06]  in the depths of your being
[254.06 --> 255.36]  satisfaction.
[255.36 --> 255.80]  Right?
[257.88 --> 260.04]  Even, actually, as we see it in Scripture,
[260.24 --> 262.36]  right, in those famous sort of rejoicing passages
[262.36 --> 263.60]  of Philippians 4
[263.60 --> 265.08]  or 1 Thessalonians 5,
[265.34 --> 267.38]  right, where we are told to rejoice always.
[268.50 --> 268.78]  Right?
[268.82 --> 270.02]  Even that phrase
[270.02 --> 271.62]  or the word there for rejoice
[271.62 --> 274.28]  can mean sort of calmly happy
[274.28 --> 275.44]  or serene.
[276.48 --> 276.74]  Right?
[276.76 --> 278.80]  The kind of joy that I'm talking about
[278.80 --> 280.70]  is one that you may be familiar with.
[281.36 --> 281.78]  Right?
[281.84 --> 282.32]  It's the
[282.32 --> 284.96]  when sorrows like sea billows roll,
[284.96 --> 285.72]  it's the
[285.72 --> 287.24]  though Satan should buffet,
[287.38 --> 288.88]  though trials should come,
[289.42 --> 291.32]  it is well
[291.32 --> 293.24]  with my soul.
[293.80 --> 295.34]  That's the kind of joy
[295.34 --> 297.28]  that I'm talking about.
[297.54 --> 297.70]  Right?
[297.82 --> 299.54]  Joy is more than peace,
[299.60 --> 301.20]  though that's inclusive of it,
[301.24 --> 302.18]  and we will actually return
[302.18 --> 303.22]  to the theme of peace
[303.22 --> 304.48]  in our worship together
[304.48 --> 305.34]  next week.
[305.48 --> 307.24]  But joy is contentment,
[307.36 --> 308.78]  it is satisfaction.
[309.40 --> 310.50]  Joy for the Christian
[310.50 --> 310.98]  is an
[310.98 --> 312.04]  it is well
[312.04 --> 313.02]  rejoicing.
[313.02 --> 316.32]  And then here's the bigger point.
[317.60 --> 319.26]  Joy comes fully
[319.26 --> 321.76]  or joy only comes
[321.76 --> 323.84]  in relation to Jesus.
[323.84 --> 326.18]  That kind of deep soul satisfaction
[326.18 --> 327.86]  comes in relation
[327.86 --> 329.14]  to Jesus.
[329.56 --> 329.84]  Right?
[329.96 --> 330.06]  To
[330.06 --> 330.60]  to
[330.60 --> 333.68]  Jesus in being known
[333.68 --> 335.04]  and knowing
[335.04 --> 335.86]  him.
[336.82 --> 337.56]  Now you can see this
[337.56 --> 338.34]  all over the Bible,
[338.34 --> 339.98]  but we're going to see it
[339.98 --> 340.84]  specifically here
[340.84 --> 342.52]  from Isaiah 60.
[342.60 --> 343.22]  This is a pretty
[343.22 --> 345.00]  traditional Advent text
[345.00 --> 346.54]  with anything
[346.54 --> 347.70]  but boring
[347.70 --> 348.46]  implications
[348.46 --> 349.70]  for your life
[349.70 --> 350.40]  and my life
[350.40 --> 350.74]  together.
[351.50 --> 352.10]  Let me outline
[352.10 --> 352.76]  the structure
[352.76 --> 354.06]  of the
[354.06 --> 354.74]  arguments
[354.74 --> 355.50]  and then
[355.50 --> 356.64]  we'll get into it.
[357.34 --> 358.24]  Text begins
[358.24 --> 358.98]  in verse 1
[358.98 --> 359.56]  saying,
[359.70 --> 360.24]  Arise,
[360.52 --> 360.92]  shine,
[361.06 --> 361.72]  for your light
[361.72 --> 362.34]  has come
[362.34 --> 363.44]  and the glory
[363.44 --> 364.32]  of the Lord
[364.32 --> 365.50]  rises upon you.
[365.50 --> 367.84]  Now the prophet Isaiah
[367.84 --> 369.40]  is speaking these words
[369.40 --> 370.30]  to Israel
[370.30 --> 371.20]  and to Judah
[371.20 --> 372.54]  very likely
[372.54 --> 373.86]  he speaks them
[373.86 --> 375.40]  as from his position
[375.40 --> 376.28]  as advisor
[376.28 --> 377.12]  to the king
[377.12 --> 378.12]  in Jerusalem.
[379.18 --> 379.70]  So at this time
[379.70 --> 380.12]  in history
[380.12 --> 381.14]  the Assyrians
[381.14 --> 381.94]  and empire
[381.94 --> 383.16]  to the north
[383.16 --> 384.10]  have taken
[384.10 --> 385.36]  the northern parts
[385.36 --> 385.96]  of Israel
[385.96 --> 386.86]  and they're threatening
[386.86 --> 387.60]  to come in
[387.60 --> 388.78]  and attack Judah
[388.78 --> 389.46]  and
[389.46 --> 391.14]  distance in the future
[391.14 --> 391.92]  not so distant
[391.92 --> 392.38]  anymore
[392.38 --> 393.06]  in the future
[393.06 --> 394.54]  is the Babylonian empire
[394.54 --> 395.68]  looming to
[395.68 --> 396.74]  take it all
[396.74 --> 398.72]  and to carry away
[398.72 --> 399.56]  the Israelites
[399.56 --> 400.38]  into exile.
[401.50 --> 402.18]  This time
[402.18 --> 403.46]  in Israel
[403.46 --> 404.38]  and Judah's history
[404.38 --> 405.20]  is one of
[405.20 --> 406.62]  a few good kings
[406.62 --> 407.78]  but lots
[407.78 --> 408.52]  and lots
[408.52 --> 410.20]  of bad ones.
[411.38 --> 412.00]  But Isaiah
[412.00 --> 413.96]  has a message
[413.96 --> 415.16]  of hope
[415.16 --> 416.52]  and it's hope
[416.52 --> 417.72]  that leads
[417.72 --> 418.86]  to joy.
[419.96 --> 420.68]  Your light
[420.68 --> 421.40]  has come
[421.40 --> 422.20]  the Lord
[422.20 --> 422.88]  rises
[422.88 --> 424.18]  upon you
[424.18 --> 425.46]  and he's speaking
[425.46 --> 426.18]  to the people
[426.18 --> 427.18]  in Jerusalem
[427.18 --> 427.96]  and of Jerusalem
[427.96 --> 428.62]  and Judea
[428.62 --> 429.28]  a promise
[429.28 --> 430.24]  of salvation
[430.24 --> 431.34]  but not just
[431.34 --> 431.94]  salvation
[431.94 --> 432.90]  from Assyria
[432.90 --> 434.20]  or from Babylon
[434.20 --> 435.76]  not only salvation
[435.76 --> 436.68]  even from the guilt
[436.68 --> 437.34]  of sin
[437.34 --> 438.56]  Isaiah's promise
[438.56 --> 439.60]  is even bigger
[439.60 --> 440.22]  than that
[440.22 --> 440.40]  right?
[440.70 --> 441.82]  God is speaking
[441.82 --> 442.56]  to his people
[442.56 --> 444.06]  a word of deliverance
[444.06 --> 445.14]  into new life
[445.14 --> 445.68]  empowered
[445.68 --> 447.18]  by the Holy Spirit
[447.18 --> 448.44]  in which the light
[448.44 --> 449.36]  of God
[449.36 --> 450.66]  his own glory
[450.66 --> 452.14]  shines out
[452.14 --> 452.84]  from the people
[452.84 --> 453.34]  of God.
[454.92 --> 455.50]  Isaiah's talking
[455.50 --> 456.22]  about life
[456.22 --> 457.18]  in the spirit
[457.18 --> 458.34]  that reflects
[458.34 --> 459.22]  the life
[459.22 --> 460.60]  of God's
[460.60 --> 461.24]  spirit.
[462.58 --> 463.62]  Like one writer
[463.62 --> 464.40]  has put it
[464.40 --> 465.90]  like a city
[465.90 --> 466.40]  gleaming
[466.40 --> 467.16]  in the light
[467.16 --> 467.78]  of a newly
[467.78 --> 468.56]  risen sun
[468.56 --> 469.24]  they shine
[469.24 --> 469.92]  with a beauty
[469.92 --> 470.64]  that is not
[470.64 --> 471.20]  their own.
[471.88 --> 472.22]  Right?
[472.30 --> 473.00]  They shine
[473.00 --> 474.06]  with a beauty
[474.06 --> 475.08]  that is not
[475.08 --> 475.62]  their own.
[476.82 --> 477.30]  Darkness
[477.30 --> 478.48]  covers the earth
[478.48 --> 479.40]  a thick darkness
[479.40 --> 480.76]  is over the people
[480.76 --> 481.72]  that's the situation
[481.72 --> 482.66]  that they find
[482.66 --> 483.18]  themselves in
[483.18 --> 483.70]  that's their
[483.70 --> 484.92]  current reality
[484.92 --> 485.76]  but God
[485.76 --> 486.36]  has a promised
[486.36 --> 487.22]  future for them
[487.22 --> 487.84]  a future
[487.84 --> 489.06]  that is emerging
[489.06 --> 490.24]  in them already
[490.24 --> 491.48]  in this promise
[491.48 --> 491.76]  right?
[491.88 --> 492.40]  A future
[492.40 --> 492.88]  that we
[492.88 --> 493.38]  today
[493.38 --> 494.48]  as Christians
[494.48 --> 495.30]  in Christmas
[495.30 --> 496.74]  know all about
[496.74 --> 497.40]  and a future
[497.40 --> 497.90]  that we
[497.90 --> 498.82]  are also
[498.82 --> 499.52]  waiting
[499.52 --> 500.24]  for the fullness
[500.24 --> 500.72]  of.
[501.66 --> 501.76]  Right?
[501.92 --> 502.26]  Advent
[502.26 --> 503.20]  is that
[503.20 --> 504.22]  season
[504.22 --> 505.74]  the darkness
[505.74 --> 506.52]  is increasing
[506.52 --> 508.42]  at its peak
[508.42 --> 509.22]  maybe.
[510.64 --> 511.42]  Sunrise this
[511.42 --> 512.08]  morning was
[512.08 --> 513.04]  at 8 o'clock
[513.04 --> 513.64]  and it's
[513.64 --> 514.38]  going to set
[514.38 --> 515.14]  at just after
[515.14 --> 515.46]  4.
[516.50 --> 517.30]  That's not a
[517.30 --> 518.00]  whole lot of sun
[518.00 --> 518.60]  even if you
[518.60 --> 519.12]  can find it
[519.12 --> 519.60]  and see it.
[522.28 --> 523.26]  The loneliness
[523.26 --> 524.02]  of our
[524.02 --> 524.76]  circumstances
[524.76 --> 526.68]  are exacerbated.
[527.40 --> 528.34]  The emptiness
[528.34 --> 529.30]  of our
[529.30 --> 530.04]  longings
[530.04 --> 531.06]  are palpable
[531.06 --> 532.90]  and yet
[532.90 --> 535.18]  and yet
[535.18 --> 536.24]  the Lord
[536.24 --> 537.58]  rises upon
[537.58 --> 538.20]  you and
[538.20 --> 538.98]  His glory
[538.98 --> 539.64]  appears
[539.64 --> 540.38]  over you
[540.38 --> 541.10]  says Isaiah.
[541.46 --> 542.12]  They shine
[542.12 --> 542.82]  with a beauty
[542.82 --> 543.66]  not their own
[543.66 --> 544.40]  track that
[544.40 --> 544.76]  but whose
[544.76 --> 545.14]  beauty
[545.14 --> 545.68]  is it?
[545.76 --> 546.66]  Whose beauty
[546.66 --> 547.76]  do you shine
[547.76 --> 548.22]  with?
[548.76 --> 549.10]  You shine
[549.10 --> 549.72]  with God's
[549.72 --> 550.06]  beauty
[550.06 --> 550.60]  right?
[550.66 --> 551.22]  The beauty
[551.22 --> 552.04]  of the glory
[552.04 --> 552.68]  of God
[552.68 --> 553.36]  the word
[553.36 --> 554.00]  made flesh
[554.00 --> 554.58]  the lamb
[554.58 --> 555.44]  who was slain
[555.44 --> 556.16]  and the lion
[556.16 --> 556.76]  of Judah
[556.76 --> 557.78]  you shine
[557.78 --> 558.62]  with the radiance
[558.62 --> 559.58]  of he who
[559.58 --> 560.14]  is true
[560.14 --> 560.52]  light
[560.52 --> 561.06]  of true
[561.06 --> 561.38]  light
[561.38 --> 561.92]  come from
[561.92 --> 562.34]  the father
[562.34 --> 562.78]  full
[562.78 --> 563.54]  of grace
[563.54 --> 564.30]  and truth
[564.30 --> 565.46]  and people
[565.46 --> 566.50]  see that
[566.50 --> 567.28]  light shining
[567.28 --> 567.94]  in the world
[567.94 --> 569.08]  people long
[569.08 --> 569.64]  for that
[569.64 --> 570.92]  light radiating
[570.92 --> 571.58]  out of you
[571.58 --> 572.38]  people want
[572.38 --> 573.04]  to shine
[573.04 --> 573.90]  in the same
[573.90 --> 574.22]  way
[574.22 --> 575.40]  it's infectious
[575.40 --> 576.52]  right?
[576.58 --> 577.14]  There's something
[577.14 --> 578.06]  about Christians
[578.06 --> 579.24]  in the world
[579.24 --> 580.00]  that should be
[580.00 --> 580.54]  compelling
[580.54 --> 581.84]  and winsome
[581.84 --> 582.76]  right?
[582.88 --> 583.80]  Even as the
[583.80 --> 584.20]  darkness
[584.20 --> 585.22]  rises
[585.22 --> 586.26]  even when
[586.26 --> 586.70]  there is a
[586.70 --> 587.76]  global pandemic
[587.76 --> 588.90]  even when
[588.90 --> 589.46]  we can't
[589.46 --> 590.16]  gather in
[590.16 --> 590.70]  ways that
[590.70 --> 591.12]  we want
[591.12 --> 591.32]  to
[591.32 --> 592.18]  even if
[592.18 --> 592.76]  your Christmas
[592.76 --> 593.48]  and your
[593.48 --> 593.92]  New Year's
[593.92 --> 594.34]  celebrations
[594.34 --> 594.76]  are going
[594.76 --> 594.98]  to look
[594.98 --> 595.40]  like two
[595.40 --> 595.80]  people
[595.80 --> 596.52]  or three
[596.52 --> 596.86]  people
[596.86 --> 597.34]  rather than
[597.34 --> 597.72]  the 10
[597.72 --> 598.24]  or 12
[598.24 --> 598.84]  or 30
[598.84 --> 599.34]  that you
[599.34 --> 599.74]  would like
[599.74 --> 600.70]  it to be
[600.70 --> 601.50]  even in
[601.50 --> 602.16]  that moment
[602.16 --> 604.62]  you can
[604.62 --> 605.08]  shine
[605.08 --> 608.60]  I've been
[608.60 --> 609.08]  saying all
[609.08 --> 609.44]  along
[609.44 --> 610.20]  in the midst
[610.20 --> 610.58]  of this
[610.58 --> 611.50]  that your
[611.50 --> 611.94]  attitude
[611.94 --> 613.20]  tells a
[613.20 --> 613.60]  story
[613.60 --> 614.82]  right?
[614.84 --> 615.18]  The way
[615.18 --> 616.16]  you engage
[616.16 --> 617.18]  our present
[617.18 --> 618.16]  situation
[618.16 --> 618.88]  our current
[618.88 --> 619.40]  reality
[619.40 --> 620.26]  reveals
[620.26 --> 621.42]  something about
[621.42 --> 622.08]  you and
[622.08 --> 622.80]  your heart
[622.80 --> 623.42]  and your
[623.42 --> 623.90]  loves
[623.90 --> 624.52]  and your
[624.52 --> 624.94]  joys
[624.94 --> 626.32]  life
[626.32 --> 626.98]  is telling
[626.98 --> 628.00]  a story
[628.00 --> 628.74]  your attitude
[628.74 --> 629.74]  about COVID
[629.74 --> 630.56]  right?
[630.66 --> 631.28]  About church
[631.28 --> 631.98]  about work
[631.98 --> 633.04]  about parenting
[633.04 --> 633.82]  or hockey
[633.82 --> 634.38]  practice
[634.38 --> 635.18]  or homework
[635.18 --> 636.16]  all of that
[636.16 --> 637.20]  tells a story
[637.20 --> 637.96]  about you
[637.96 --> 639.10]  and your
[639.10 --> 639.90]  heart
[639.90 --> 644.02]  is the story
[644.02 --> 644.64]  your life
[644.64 --> 645.28]  is telling
[645.28 --> 646.72]  is the story
[646.72 --> 647.72]  your conversation
[647.72 --> 649.36]  is revealing
[649.36 --> 650.84]  the compelling
[650.84 --> 652.10]  story of God's
[652.10 --> 652.60]  glory
[652.60 --> 655.18]  or
[655.18 --> 657.28]  is it
[657.28 --> 658.58]  the convicting
[658.58 --> 659.66]  story of our
[659.66 --> 660.68]  own selfishness
[660.68 --> 663.06]  nations
[663.06 --> 663.96]  will come
[663.96 --> 664.88]  to your light
[664.88 --> 666.04]  and kings
[666.04 --> 667.28]  to the brightness
[667.28 --> 668.26]  of your dawn
[668.26 --> 669.42]  right?
[669.48 --> 670.26]  Isaiah's promise
[670.26 --> 671.14]  to us
[671.14 --> 671.96]  is that when you
[671.96 --> 673.20]  reveal God
[673.20 --> 674.10]  when you tell
[674.10 --> 675.36]  his story
[675.36 --> 676.32]  when you live
[676.32 --> 677.10]  your life
[677.10 --> 677.74]  with Jesus
[677.74 --> 678.62]  at the center
[678.62 --> 679.90]  people will
[679.90 --> 680.78]  come to you
[680.78 --> 681.86]  they will be drawn
[681.86 --> 682.74]  to the beauty
[682.74 --> 683.64]  that is not
[683.64 --> 684.24]  your own
[684.24 --> 685.88]  because our
[685.88 --> 686.44]  hearts
[686.44 --> 687.68]  long
[687.68 --> 688.70]  for Jesus
[688.70 --> 689.86]  we long
[689.86 --> 690.60]  for the one
[690.60 --> 691.56]  for whom
[691.56 --> 692.44]  we were
[692.44 --> 693.20]  created
[693.20 --> 695.66]  there's a
[695.66 --> 696.70]  fourth century
[696.70 --> 697.78]  church father
[697.78 --> 698.24]  by the name
[698.24 --> 698.86]  of Augustine
[698.86 --> 700.52]  and rather famously
[700.52 --> 701.70]  he once said
[701.70 --> 703.02]  you have created
[703.02 --> 704.22]  us for yourself
[704.22 --> 704.88]  oh Lord
[704.88 --> 705.84]  and our hearts
[705.84 --> 706.58]  are restless
[706.58 --> 708.28]  until they rest
[708.28 --> 709.48]  in you
[709.48 --> 711.28]  C.S. Lewis
[711.28 --> 712.90]  in the 20th century
[712.90 --> 714.30]  just a few years ago
[714.30 --> 715.14]  put it this way
[715.14 --> 715.62]  he says
[715.62 --> 716.88]  if we find
[716.88 --> 717.72]  ourselves
[717.72 --> 719.10]  with a desire
[719.10 --> 719.88]  that nothing
[719.88 --> 720.86]  in this world
[720.86 --> 721.70]  can satisfy
[721.70 --> 723.16]  the most probable
[723.16 --> 724.02]  explanation
[724.02 --> 725.14]  is that we were
[725.14 --> 725.96]  made for another
[725.96 --> 726.40]  world
[726.40 --> 727.82]  and Lewis
[727.82 --> 728.74]  actually will build
[728.74 --> 729.12]  on that
[729.12 --> 729.98]  he will expand
[729.98 --> 730.46]  on that
[730.46 --> 731.06]  and I don't want
[731.06 --> 731.56]  to lose you
[731.56 --> 732.16]  in the weeds
[732.16 --> 732.90]  of an exegesis
[732.90 --> 733.66]  of C.S. Lewis
[733.66 --> 734.42]  that's not what
[734.42 --> 734.88]  we're here for
[734.88 --> 735.56]  but just one more
[735.56 --> 736.32]  quote because I think
[736.32 --> 737.44]  it is really helpful
[737.44 --> 738.42]  for Lewis
[738.42 --> 739.84]  desire and joy
[739.84 --> 741.76]  are sort of
[741.76 --> 742.70]  synonymous terms
[742.70 --> 744.32]  and he will go on
[744.32 --> 745.58]  to define joy
[745.58 --> 748.06]  as an unsatisfied desire
[748.06 --> 749.10]  which is itself
[749.10 --> 750.06]  more desirable
[750.06 --> 751.24]  than any other
[751.24 --> 751.96]  satisfaction
[751.96 --> 754.28]  I call it joy
[754.28 --> 755.10]  Lewis continues
[755.10 --> 756.16]  which is here
[756.16 --> 757.18]  a technical term
[757.18 --> 757.82]  and must be
[757.82 --> 758.64]  sharply distinguished
[758.64 --> 759.76]  from both happiness
[759.76 --> 761.36]  and from pleasure
[761.36 --> 762.60]  which is exactly
[762.60 --> 763.08]  the point
[763.08 --> 764.04]  that we started with
[764.04 --> 764.48]  right
[764.48 --> 766.60]  that Christian joy
[766.60 --> 767.82]  is more than
[767.82 --> 768.70]  feeling happy
[768.70 --> 769.58]  or jolly
[769.58 --> 771.00]  or whatever it is
[771.00 --> 771.42]  right
[771.42 --> 772.74]  joy for us
[772.74 --> 773.72]  is understood
[773.72 --> 774.64]  as deep
[774.64 --> 775.56]  down
[775.56 --> 776.72]  satisfaction
[776.72 --> 779.92]  God is
[779.92 --> 780.92]  speaking
[780.92 --> 781.64]  this morning
[781.64 --> 783.74]  and he is saying
[783.74 --> 785.24]  lift your eyes
[785.24 --> 785.62]  up
[785.62 --> 786.50]  and look
[786.50 --> 787.34]  about you
[787.34 --> 789.36]  come and see
[789.36 --> 790.10]  what the Lord
[790.10 --> 791.08]  has done
[791.08 --> 793.96]  look at the story
[793.96 --> 795.02]  of your life
[795.02 --> 796.26]  and see how
[796.26 --> 797.32]  Jesus is
[797.32 --> 798.22]  the hero
[798.22 --> 799.54]  tell the story
[799.54 --> 800.50]  of your life
[800.50 --> 801.40]  with Jesus
[801.40 --> 802.56]  as the hero
[802.56 --> 803.18]  and see
[803.18 --> 804.16]  how God
[804.16 --> 805.24]  honors that
[805.24 --> 807.56]  and when you
[807.56 --> 808.30]  lift your eyes
[808.30 --> 809.88]  and you see
[809.88 --> 810.30]  God
[810.30 --> 810.92]  and you see
[810.92 --> 812.02]  his beauty
[812.02 --> 813.16]  and his beauty
[813.16 --> 813.92]  made manifest
[813.92 --> 814.82]  in the lives
[814.82 --> 815.44]  of the believers
[815.44 --> 816.54]  around you
[816.54 --> 817.86]  when Christian
[817.86 --> 818.66]  living
[818.66 --> 819.74]  tells
[819.74 --> 820.98]  the Advent
[820.98 --> 821.88]  joy
[821.88 --> 822.94]  story
[822.94 --> 824.56]  look at verse 5
[824.56 --> 825.50]  then
[825.50 --> 827.18]  you will be radiant
[827.18 --> 828.84]  and your heart
[828.84 --> 829.64]  will throb
[829.64 --> 830.90]  and swell
[830.90 --> 832.18]  with joy
[832.18 --> 834.98]  you were created
[834.98 --> 836.60]  for joy
[836.60 --> 838.48]  even in this
[838.48 --> 839.64]  present darkness
[839.64 --> 840.76]  you are
[840.76 --> 842.00]  for joy
[842.00 --> 843.24]  and a joy
[843.24 --> 843.96]  that is so much
[843.96 --> 844.86]  more than happy
[844.86 --> 845.52]  clappy
[845.52 --> 846.28]  platitudes
[846.28 --> 846.94]  right
[846.94 --> 848.22]  right here
[848.22 --> 849.26]  this deep
[849.26 --> 850.08]  down
[850.08 --> 850.96]  it is well
[850.96 --> 852.14]  with my soul
[852.14 --> 853.10]  joy
[853.10 --> 855.58]  I love the way
[855.58 --> 856.56]  that the Westminster
[856.56 --> 857.20]  shorter
[857.20 --> 858.54]  catechism puts it
[858.54 --> 859.64]  it asks the question
[859.64 --> 860.58]  what is the chief
[860.58 --> 861.64]  end of humanity
[861.64 --> 862.22]  right
[862.22 --> 863.20]  what is your purpose
[863.20 --> 864.34]  that you were created
[864.34 --> 864.78]  for
[864.78 --> 865.50]  and the answer
[865.50 --> 866.04]  that it gives
[866.04 --> 866.86]  is to worship
[866.86 --> 867.52]  God
[867.52 --> 869.34]  and enjoy
[869.34 --> 870.00]  him
[870.00 --> 871.30]  forever
[871.30 --> 874.56]  Jonathan Edwards
[874.56 --> 875.84]  is a Puritan
[875.84 --> 876.30]  pastor
[876.30 --> 876.34]  pastor
[876.34 --> 877.12]  and theologian
[877.12 --> 877.82]  from some
[877.82 --> 878.84]  300 years ago
[878.84 --> 880.54]  and he has
[880.54 --> 881.68]  a beautiful thesis
[881.68 --> 882.64]  in a treatise
[882.64 --> 883.16]  that he calls
[883.16 --> 884.34]  religious affections
[884.34 --> 885.50]  he writes
[885.50 --> 887.04]  that true religion
[887.04 --> 888.82]  in large part
[888.82 --> 889.58]  consists
[889.58 --> 890.70]  of holy
[890.70 --> 891.78]  affections
[891.78 --> 893.42]  and in that work
[893.42 --> 894.44]  he goes on
[894.44 --> 895.48]  to focus out
[895.48 --> 896.12]  joy
[896.12 --> 897.26]  as one of
[897.26 --> 898.32]  the holy
[898.32 --> 899.18]  affections
[899.18 --> 900.38]  and then
[900.38 --> 901.16]  of joy
[901.16 --> 901.90]  he says
[901.90 --> 902.70]  the nature
[902.70 --> 903.38]  of Christian
[903.38 --> 903.76]  joy
[903.76 --> 905.24]  is unspeakable
[905.24 --> 906.54]  because it is
[906.54 --> 907.08]  purer
[907.08 --> 908.20]  and more sublime
[908.20 --> 908.88]  and heavenly
[908.88 --> 909.82]  because it is
[909.82 --> 910.38]  supernatural
[910.38 --> 911.70]  truly divine
[911.70 --> 913.10]  and so ineffably
[913.10 --> 913.82]  excellent
[913.82 --> 915.26]  no words
[915.26 --> 916.04]  can describe
[916.04 --> 917.34]  the sublimity
[917.34 --> 918.28]  and exquisite
[918.28 --> 918.88]  sweetness
[918.88 --> 919.74]  of joy
[919.74 --> 920.90]  in Christ
[920.90 --> 921.82]  end quote
[921.82 --> 923.52]  now the irony
[923.52 --> 924.36]  is not lost
[924.36 --> 924.90]  on me
[924.90 --> 925.70]  that he says
[925.70 --> 926.26]  no words
[926.26 --> 926.90]  can describe
[926.90 --> 927.62]  the sublimity
[927.62 --> 928.14]  and exquisite
[928.14 --> 928.48]  sweetness
[928.48 --> 928.92]  of Christ
[928.92 --> 929.78]  and then he goes
[929.78 --> 930.38]  on for pages
[930.38 --> 930.94]  and chapters
[930.94 --> 931.50]  and chapters
[931.50 --> 932.42]  to try to do
[932.42 --> 933.16]  just that
[933.16 --> 935.08]  but I love
[935.08 --> 935.88]  what he says
[935.88 --> 936.84]  and he writes
[936.84 --> 937.40]  in sort of
[937.40 --> 937.94]  the conclusion
[937.94 --> 938.54]  of that
[938.54 --> 939.44]  is that Christ
[939.44 --> 940.72]  by faith
[940.72 --> 941.96]  is the foundation
[941.96 --> 944.18]  of all joy
[944.18 --> 946.76]  you were created
[946.76 --> 948.40]  for joy
[948.40 --> 950.72]  and the gospel
[950.72 --> 951.42]  secures that
[951.42 --> 951.90]  for you

[955.82 --> 956.34]  I should have
[956.34 --> 956.60]  lived
[956.60 --> 957.54]  who died
[957.54 --> 958.18]  the death
[958.18 --> 958.70]  that I
[958.70 --> 959.56]  deserved
[959.56 --> 960.58]  right
[960.58 --> 961.52]  of Jesus
[961.52 --> 962.30]  we can read
[962.30 --> 962.92]  that it was
[962.92 --> 963.74]  for the joy
[963.74 --> 964.90]  set before him
[964.90 --> 966.08]  that he endured
[966.08 --> 966.68]  the cross
[966.68 --> 967.30]  and scorned
[967.30 --> 967.76]  its shame

[985.60 --> 986.46]  that pierces
[986.46 --> 987.86]  the darkness
[987.86 --> 990.36]  Peter writes
[990.36 --> 991.52]  in his first epistle
[991.52 --> 991.94]  he says
[991.94 --> 993.12]  though you have not
[993.12 --> 993.74]  seen him
[993.74 --> 994.54]  that's Jesus

[995.60 --> 996.18]  seen Jesus
[996.18 --> 996.96]  you love him
[996.96 --> 997.90]  and even though
[997.90 --> 999.10]  you do not see him

[1015.60 --> 1016.70]  joy
[1016.70 --> 1019.92]  when trials come
[1019.92 --> 1021.56]  when Satan
[1021.56 --> 1022.06]  buffets
[1022.06 --> 1022.98]  and sea billows
[1022.98 --> 1023.32]  roll

[1024.62 --> 1026.04]  it is well
[1026.04 --> 1027.44]  with my soul
[1027.44 --> 1029.46]  your life
[1029.46 --> 1030.02]  is telling

[1032.34 --> 1032.74]  Jesus
[1032.74 --> 1034.04]  story
[1034.04 --> 1034.80]  right
[1034.80 --> 1035.08]  do your
[1035.08 --> 1035.90]  do your neighbors
[1035.90 --> 1036.94]  hear Jesus
[1036.94 --> 1038.12]  when they talk
[1038.12 --> 1038.58]  to you

[1042.82 --> 1043.88]  or whatever
[1043.88 --> 1045.44]  platform that you are on
[1045.44 --> 1047.00]  do your online comments
[1047.00 --> 1048.66]  reveal that you are created
[1048.66 --> 1049.96]  for so much more
[1049.96 --> 1051.82]  than this present darkness
[1051.82 --> 1055.62]  the joy of Jesus
[1055.62 --> 1056.52]  doesn't fade
[1056.52 --> 1057.86]  or spoil

[1059.30 --> 1061.32]  the joy of Jesus
[1061.32 --> 1062.82]  is eternal
[1062.82 --> 1064.02]  because Jesus
[1064.02 --> 1065.40]  is eternal

[1066.70 --> 1068.36]  what your life
[1068.36 --> 1069.68]  would look like
[1069.68 --> 1071.36]  with eternal joy
[1071.36 --> 1072.04]  in Jesus
[1072.04 --> 1074.02]  because really
