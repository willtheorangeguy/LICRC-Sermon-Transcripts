[0.00 → 12.08] Well, this is week number five of the Joseph series, and we're going to read today from
[12.08 → 17.60] the latter part of Genesis 41 and then all of chapter 42.
[22.04 → 29.72] And we last left Joseph when he had just been taken out of prison and had a pretty incredible
[29.72 → 35.16] promotion from prisoner to second in command in the Egyptian empire.
[38.22 → 44.14] Joseph was 30 years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh, king of Egypt.
[45.26 → 49.60] And Joseph went out from Pharaoh's presence and travelled throughout Egypt.
[50.54 → 54.30] During the seven years of abundance, the land produced plentifully.
[55.12 → 60.00] Joseph collected all the food produced in those seven years of abundance in Egypt and
[60.00 → 61.16] stored it in the cities.
[61.58 → 65.52] In each city, he put the food grown in the fields surrounding it.
[66.34 → 70.32] Joseph stored up huge quantities of grain, like the sand of the sea.
[70.50 → 75.60] It was so much that he stopped keeping records because it was beyond measure.
[75.60 → 83.16] Before the years of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph by Senate, daughter of Porifera,
[83.60 → 84.40] priest of On.
[85.04 → 87.74] Joseph named his firstborn Manasseh and said,
[88.46 → 93.52] It is because God has made me forget all my trouble and all my father's household.
[94.60 → 97.00] The second son he named Ephraim and said,
[97.50 → 101.56] It is because God has made me fruitful in the land of my sovereign.
[101.56 → 107.02] The seven years of abundance in Egypt came to an end.
[107.74 → 111.64] And the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said.
[112.56 → 117.38] There was famine in all the other lands, but in the whole land of Egypt there was food.
[118.24 → 122.32] When all Egypt began to fuel the famine, the people cried out to Pharaoh for food.
[122.72 → 124.38] Then Pharaoh told all the Egyptians,
[124.70 → 126.52] Go to Joseph and do what he tells you.
[126.52 → 129.70] When the famine had spread over the whole country,
[130.32 → 133.74] Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians,
[134.10 → 136.58] for the famine was severe throughout Egypt.
[137.02 → 140.36] And all the world came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph,
[140.70 → 143.66] because the famine was severe everywhere.
[145.42 → 148.66] When Jacob learned there was grain in Egypt,
[148.84 → 150.14] he said to his sons,
[150.62 → 153.02] Why do you just keep looking at each other?
[153.02 → 155.50] I have heard that there is grain in Egypt.
[155.70 → 157.36] Go down there and buy some for us,
[157.38 → 159.18] so that we may live and not die.
[160.88 → 163.96] Then ten of Joseph's brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.
[164.32 → 166.92] But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph's brother,
[167.14 → 170.90] with the others, because he was afraid that harm might come to him.
[171.68 → 174.68] So Israel's sons were among those who went to buy grain,
[174.88 → 178.06] for there was famine in the land of Canaan also.
[178.06 → 181.58] Now Joseph was the governor of the land,
[181.68 → 183.76] the person who sold grain to all its people.
[184.40 → 186.00] So when Joseph's brothers arrived,
[186.10 → 188.54] they bowed down to him with their faces to the ground.
[189.36 → 191.26] As soon as Joseph saw his brothers,
[191.58 → 192.90] he recognized them.
[193.66 → 195.46] But he pretended to be a stranger
[195.46 → 197.40] and spoke harshly to them.
[197.90 → 199.48] Where do you come from? He asked.
[200.08 → 202.02] From the land of Canaan, they replied,
[202.18 → 203.04] to buy food.
[204.28 → 205.94] Although Joseph recognized his brothers,
[205.94 → 207.52] they did not recognize him.
[208.06 → 210.12] Then he remembered his dreams about them
[210.12 → 210.80] and said to them,
[211.08 → 211.72] You are spies.
[212.42 → 214.66] You have come to see where our land is unprotected.
[215.48 → 216.78] No, my lord, they answered.
[217.18 → 219.06] Your servants have come to buy food.
[219.42 → 221.18] We are all the sons of one man.
[221.66 → 224.24] Your servants are honest men, not spies.
[224.68 → 225.86] No, he said to them.
[226.28 → 228.82] You have come to see where our land is unprotected.
[229.70 → 230.76] But they replied,
[230.96 → 232.52] Your servants were twelve brothers,
[232.88 → 235.32] the sons of one man who lives in the land of Canaan.
[235.32 → 237.20] The youngest is now with our father,
[237.38 → 238.56] and one is no more.
[239.26 → 240.28] Joseph said to them,
[240.40 → 241.76] It is just as I told you.
[241.98 → 242.90] You are spies,
[243.26 → 244.86] and this is how you will be tested.
[245.42 → 247.14] As surely as Pharaoh lives,
[247.28 → 248.94] you will not leave this place
[248.94 → 251.72] unless your youngest brother comes here.
[252.52 → 254.50] Send one of your number to get your brother.
[254.78 → 256.42] The rest of you will be kept in prison
[256.42 → 258.54] so that your words may be tested
[258.54 → 260.64] to see if you are telling the truth.
[260.64 → 262.08] If you are not,
[262.46 → 263.26] then surely,
[263.38 → 265.08] as surely as Pharaoh lives,
[265.48 → 266.98] you are spies.
[267.68 → 270.48] And he put them all in custody for three days.
[271.56 → 272.60] On the third day,
[272.66 → 273.50] Joseph said to them,
[273.90 → 274.60] Do this,
[275.20 → 276.14] and you will live,
[276.60 → 277.44] for I fear God.
[278.50 → 279.68] If you are honest men,
[279.74 → 281.54] let one of your brothers stay here in prison
[281.54 → 282.88] while the rest of you go
[282.88 → 285.30] and take grain back for your starving households.
[285.76 → 288.40] But you must bring your youngest brother to me
[288.40 → 290.58] so that your words may be verified
[290.58 → 292.58] and that you may not die.
[294.04 → 296.06] This they proceeded to do.
[297.22 → 298.36] They said to one another,
[298.94 → 301.36] Surely we are being punished because of our brother.
[302.02 → 303.92] We saw how distressed he was
[303.92 → 305.68] when he pleaded with us for his life,
[305.80 → 307.06] but we would not listen.
[307.24 → 309.90] That's why this distress has come on us.
[310.96 → 311.84] Reuben replied,
[312.26 → 314.36] Didn't I tell you not to sin against the boy?
[314.50 → 315.58] But you wouldn't listen.
[315.58 → 318.44] Now we must give an accounting for his blood.
[319.98 → 323.26] They did not realize that Joseph could understand them
[323.26 → 325.68] since he was using an interpreter.
[327.36 → 330.22] He turned away from them and began to weep,
[330.68 → 332.64] but then came back and spoke to them again.
[333.42 → 334.54] He had Simeon bound,
[334.68 → 335.90] of Simeon taken from them
[335.90 → 337.32] and bound before their eyes.
[337.88 → 340.22] Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain,
[340.40 → 342.82] to put each man's silver back in his sack,
[342.82 → 344.98] and to give them provisions for their journey.
[345.58 → 347.14] After this was done for them,
[347.22 → 349.66] they loaded their grain on their donkeys and left.
[350.56 → 352.14] At the place where they stopped for the night,
[352.26 → 353.48] one of them opened his sack
[353.48 → 355.04] to get feed for his donkey,
[355.36 → 358.52] and he saw his silver in the mouth of his sack.
[359.18 → 360.98] My silver has been returned,
[361.46 → 363.04] he said to my brother, his brothers.
[363.44 → 365.44] Here it is in my sack.
[366.28 → 367.50] Their hearts sank,
[367.60 → 369.58] and they turned to each other trembling and said,
[369.98 → 373.04] What is this that God has done to us?
[373.04 → 377.26] When they came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan,
[377.42 → 379.10] they told him all that had happened to them.
[379.50 → 379.90] They said,
[380.02 → 382.74] The man who was lord over the land spoke harshly to us
[382.74 → 385.42] and treated us as though we were spying on the land.
[386.06 → 387.10] But we said to him,
[387.26 → 388.40] We are honest men.
[388.68 → 389.82] We are not spies.
[390.62 → 391.68] We were twelve brothers,
[391.88 → 392.94] sons of one father.
[393.26 → 394.12] One is no more,
[394.18 → 396.34] and the youngest is now with our father in Canaan.
[396.34 → 399.98] Then the man who was lord over the land said to us,
[400.48 → 402.76] This is how I will know whether you are honest men.
[403.42 → 405.34] Leave one of your brothers here with me
[405.34 → 408.22] and take food for your starving households and go.
[408.74 → 410.46] But bring your youngest brother to me
[410.46 → 413.86] so I will know that you are not spies but honest men.
[414.46 → 416.22] Then I will give your brother back to you,
[416.56 → 418.10] and you can trade in the land.
[419.42 → 421.20] As they were emptying their sacks,
[421.38 → 424.84] there in each man's sack was his pouch of silver.
[424.84 → 428.28] When they and their father saw the money pouches,
[428.44 → 429.56] they were frightened.
[430.42 → 431.96] Their father Jacob said to them,
[432.48 → 434.62] You have deprived me of my children.
[435.38 → 436.52] Joseph is no more,
[436.96 → 438.30] and Simeon is no more,
[438.48 → 440.14] and now you want to take Benjamin.
[440.40 → 442.24] Everything is against me.
[443.54 → 445.04] Then Reuben said to his father,
[445.80 → 448.08] You may put both of my sons to death
[448.08 → 450.36] if I do not bring him back to you.
[451.08 → 452.40] Entrust him to my care,
[452.90 → 454.04] and I will bring him back.
[454.84 → 456.16] But Jacob said,
[456.48 → 458.34] My son will not go down there with you.
[458.84 → 459.98] His brother is dead,
[460.18 → 462.66] and he is the only one left.
[463.28 → 465.74] If harm comes to him on the journey you are taking,
[466.16 → 470.32] you will bring my gray head down to the grave in sorrow.
[471.00 → 473.20] This is the word of the Lord.
[474.10 → 474.86] Let's pray.
[475.20 → 475.88] Gracious God,
[476.88 → 479.78] help us to understand
[479.78 → 484.68] this story in the context of our own lives as well.
[486.68 → 488.24] Open the eyes of our heart
[488.24 → 490.30] to hear your word to us today.
[491.00 → 492.88] In Jesus' name, amen.
[492.88 → 499.42] During the hearings a number of years ago
[499.42 → 504.14] of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Committee,
[506.14 → 507.86] an aging mother and wife
[507.86 → 510.70] stood in an emotionally charged courtroom,
[511.98 → 514.34] listening to police officers admit
[514.34 → 518.60] to the atrocities committed in the name of apartheid
[518.60 → 520.48] against her family.
[522.14 → 524.50] One of them, Officer Vander brook,
[525.58 → 527.98] admitted his responsibility in the death
[527.98 → 530.08] of her 18-year-old son.
[531.76 → 533.22] Along with other officers,
[533.56 → 537.04] he shot the young man at point-blank range,
[537.04 → 541.52] then partied as the young man's body
[541.52 → 543.48] was slowly reduced to ashes
[543.48 → 546.42] while roasting over an open fire.
[548.08 → 550.20] Eight years later, Vander brook,
[550.90 → 551.74] along with others,
[552.00 → 554.14] returned and seized her husband.
[555.36 → 556.72] She was forced to watch
[556.72 → 559.42] as his body was doused with gasoline
[559.42 → 562.74] and the police officers ignited the flames
[562.74 → 565.42] that consumed and killed him.
[567.04 → 571.18] Now, Vander brook stood before her,
[571.90 → 573.14] awaiting judgment.
[574.66 → 576.70] He caused her incredible pain,
[577.30 → 578.72] taken so much from her,
[578.80 → 581.48] but today the tables were turned.
[582.54 → 584.30] Now, as the committee asked her
[584.30 → 586.46] what she would want in this matter
[586.46 → 587.94] to bring about justice,
[588.34 → 591.70] she had the power to influence his future,
[592.86 → 595.56] a future that could mean life imprisonment,
[595.56 → 599.12] even, perhaps, death.
[602.00 → 603.18] Speaking calmly,
[604.30 → 607.04] this is what she told the committee.
[608.32 → 610.66] I would like three things.
[611.72 → 615.14] First, I would like Mr. Vander brook
[615.14 → 617.96] to take me where my husband's body was burned.
[617.96 → 621.14] I would like to sweep up the dust
[621.14 → 624.22] so I could give him a decent burial.
[625.92 → 628.82] Second, Mr. Vander brook
[628.82 → 631.96] has taken all the family I have from me,
[632.52 → 635.68] and I have a lot of love to give.
[637.10 → 638.70] So twice a month,
[639.24 → 640.72] I'd like him to come down
[640.72 → 643.42] and spend a day with me in the ghetto
[643.42 → 646.48] so I could be a mother to him.
[648.28 → 649.68] Third, and finally,
[650.08 → 652.08] I'd like Mr. Vander brook to know
[652.08 → 653.76] that God has forgiven him,
[654.56 → 656.68] and I can forgive him too.
[656.68 → 660.84] So that he knows my forgiveness is real,
[660.84 → 662.40] I would like someone
[662.40 → 664.72] to lead me across the courtroom
[664.72 → 667.34] so I can give him a hug.
[669.28 → 672.08] As she was slowly led across the courtroom,
[672.96 → 675.82] Vander brook, overwhelmed by her response,
[676.90 → 678.18] fainted dead away.
[679.28 → 682.36] One person started singing Amazing Grace,
[682.36 → 685.12] and by the time the song ended,
[685.72 → 688.70] all who were in the courtroom joined in.
[689.48 → 690.10] True story.
[694.94 → 697.94] Nobody started singing Amazing Grace
[697.94 → 701.30] the day Joseph's brothers arrived in Egypt.
[703.60 → 706.76] Driven by need because of severe famine everywhere,
[708.32 → 710.02] Jacob sent his sons there
[710.02 → 712.64] where they faced Joseph for the first time
[712.64 → 714.42] since they had sold him
[714.42 → 717.66] into slavery over 20 years before.
[719.42 → 721.66] They didn't know it was Joseph at the time,
[721.74 → 723.70] and they would not know for quite some time yet.
[724.98 → 727.30] But Joseph recognized his brothers
[727.30 → 729.28] and found himself in a position
[729.28 → 731.42] like that South African mother
[731.42 → 733.76] where he had those responsible
[733.76 → 736.44] for so much pain in his life
[736.44 → 737.60] over a barrel.
[737.60 → 741.94] Not only does he have some influence
[741.94 → 743.04] in how they are treated,
[743.28 → 745.48] he literally has the power of life
[745.48 → 746.60] and death over them.
[748.30 → 750.76] And what would Joseph do?
[753.36 → 754.42] For that matter,
[754.56 → 756.20] and just to make it more personal
[756.20 → 757.78] and get you involved in the story
[757.78 → 758.58] right from the start,
[758.74 → 760.52] what would you do?
[762.30 → 763.96] What would each of us,
[764.06 → 765.96] each with our own unique stories,
[765.96 → 767.98] what would you do
[767.98 → 769.38] if you had a person,
[769.48 → 771.18] and maybe someone comes to mind,
[771.56 → 773.62] who caused you a lot of pain
[773.62 → 775.74] if you had that person
[775.74 → 777.08] over a barrel?
[778.76 → 779.78] Or perhaps,
[779.90 → 781.88] what have you done?
[785.14 → 787.32] I don't know how you'd answer that question.
[787.32 → 792.04] You know how one South African mother did,
[793.00 → 795.46] and Genesis 42 tells us
[795.46 → 797.10] how Joseph did.
[799.28 → 801.32] Try to imagine this situation
[801.32 → 804.88] as Joseph suddenly and unexpectedly
[804.88 → 807.30] relives his painful past.
[807.30 → 810.84] He thought he'd put it behind him.
[811.64 → 812.04] In fact,
[812.12 → 813.30] the end of Genesis 41
[813.30 → 814.50] tells us that Joseph
[814.50 → 817.52] named his firstborn son Manasseh
[817.52 → 819.06] because he said,
[819.86 → 821.80] God has made me forget
[821.80 → 823.22] all my troubles
[823.22 → 825.28] and all my father's household.
[826.64 → 828.40] Except that life
[828.40 → 830.38] doesn't really work like that,
[830.66 → 831.14] does it?
[831.14 → 834.58] The past has a way
[834.58 → 836.08] of coming back to us.
[836.40 → 838.42] We can talk until we are blue in the face
[838.42 → 839.42] about how important,
[839.74 → 841.16] how necessary it is
[841.16 → 842.94] to forgive and to forget.
[843.16 → 845.48] But most of us know by experience
[845.48 → 848.28] that as difficult as forgiving can be,
[849.22 → 852.44] forgetting is almost impossible.
[853.82 → 855.64] Even if by God's grace
[855.64 → 857.08] we have managed to forgive,
[857.48 → 860.16] do we ever really forget?
[860.16 → 865.46] Genesis 42 brings back,
[865.56 → 868.18] the past back into Joseph's present
[868.18 → 870.54] in a dramatic way.
[872.20 → 874.36] His father and brothers back home
[874.36 → 876.54] in Canaan are in desperate straits
[876.54 → 878.86] as they too have been affected
[878.86 → 880.96] by a worldwide famine.
[882.24 → 884.72] The situation is obviously serious
[884.72 → 886.88] for Jacob sends his son to Egypt
[886.88 → 888.88] to get grains as the storyteller
[888.88 → 890.32] so that we may live
[890.32 → 891.42] and not die.
[892.78 → 893.90] And so all the brothers,
[894.86 → 895.74] except for one,
[896.62 → 897.66] head down to Egypt.
[898.88 → 900.26] Benjamin, the youngest,
[900.86 → 901.66] Jacob's favourite,
[901.82 → 903.06] now that Joseph is gone,
[903.70 → 904.30] stays home.
[905.62 → 907.00] Jacob's parenting skills
[907.00 → 909.08] haven't improved much over time.
[910.46 → 911.80] Did you notice what he says
[911.80 → 913.56] at the end of Genesis 42
[913.56 → 916.18] in refusing to let Benjamin go to Egypt?
[916.84 → 917.50] Listen again.
[918.30 → 920.30] My son will not go down there with you.
[920.56 → 921.64] His brother is dead
[921.64 → 923.52] and he is the only one left.
[924.26 → 926.84] Like I thought there were 10 others,
[927.10 → 928.76] but I digress.
[929.96 → 932.36] The 10 brothers arrived in Egypt.
[933.76 → 935.84] And as ridiculous as you know it is
[935.84 → 936.66] to say by now,
[936.66 → 937.98] it so happens
[937.98 → 940.48] that although masses of foreigners
[940.48 → 942.04] were streaming into Egypt
[942.04 → 943.44] on a regular basis,
[943.88 → 945.40] Jacob's 10 sons
[945.40 → 947.40] easily lost in that crowd.
[947.78 → 948.60] And although someone
[948.60 → 950.46] in Joseph's lofty position
[950.46 → 952.26] would hardly have been on hand
[952.26 → 952.90] to approve
[952.90 → 954.86] every last grain customer,
[955.32 → 956.90] not only does Joseph manage
[956.90 → 958.06] to see his brothers,
[958.32 → 959.68] he recognizes them.
[959.68 → 964.14] But 20 years have changed Joseph,
[964.54 → 966.72] much more so than his brothers.
[967.92 → 968.76] And so the brothers
[968.76 → 970.44] do not recognize Joseph.
[971.66 → 973.08] The spoiled teenagers
[973.08 → 973.90] they had sold
[973.90 → 975.64] over 20 years ago
[975.64 → 976.98] was now almost 40.
[977.72 → 978.50] And he walked
[978.50 → 979.88] and he talked.
[980.54 → 981.70] Joseph deliberately chose
[981.70 → 982.80] to speak through an interpreter.
[983.64 → 985.00] He walked, and he talked
[985.00 → 987.34] and looked like an Egyptian.
[987.34 → 990.78] Now imagine
[990.78 → 993.06] you are Joseph
[993.06 → 994.84] in this situation.
[996.04 → 997.20] You experience
[997.20 → 998.84] a series of flashbacks.
[1000.70 → 1001.48] Flashback one,
[1001.58 → 1003.32] you're sitting in a deep hole
[1003.32 → 1003.96] in the ground,
[1004.08 → 1005.00] nothing but darkness
[1005.00 → 1005.72] around you
[1005.72 → 1007.00] in a round circle of light
[1007.00 → 1007.78] high above you.
[1008.06 → 1009.08] Your coat is gone.
[1009.38 → 1010.12] You are cold.
[1010.26 → 1011.38] And we finally learn
[1011.38 → 1012.20] from this chapter
[1012.20 → 1013.30] you are scared
[1013.30 → 1014.52] and you are crying
[1014.52 → 1015.64] and you are pleading
[1015.64 → 1016.62] for your life.
[1017.34 → 1020.04] flashback two,
[1020.78 → 1022.12] your brothers sell you
[1022.12 → 1023.38] to some strange men
[1023.38 → 1024.68] for 20 pieces of silver.
[1025.62 → 1026.64] The men bind your wrists
[1026.64 → 1027.56] so there's no escape
[1027.56 → 1028.34] and you're on your way
[1028.34 → 1028.82] to Egypt
[1028.82 → 1029.82] where you've never been
[1029.82 → 1030.90] and to slavery
[1030.90 → 1032.50] where you do the best you can
[1032.50 → 1033.24] for your master
[1033.24 → 1034.46] but can never forget
[1034.46 → 1035.70] that you are a slave
[1035.70 → 1037.74] to whatever your master desires.
[1039.74 → 1040.62] Flashback three,
[1040.84 → 1041.98] you are thrown into prison
[1041.98 → 1042.78] where you remain
[1042.78 → 1045.32] for close to 10 plus years
[1045.32 → 1048.02] because your master's wife
[1048.02 → 1049.28] falsely accused you
[1049.28 → 1050.38] of sexual assault
[1050.38 → 1051.54] and who listens
[1051.54 → 1052.62] to a slave.
[1054.42 → 1056.28] But now you have become
[1056.28 → 1057.80] incredibly powerful.
[1058.82 → 1059.82] God has blessed you.
[1059.92 → 1061.20] You are second in command
[1061.20 → 1063.02] in the whole land of Egypt
[1063.02 → 1063.90] and one day
[1063.90 → 1064.76] the perpetrators
[1064.76 → 1065.54] of your misery,
[1065.70 → 1067.14] of your past misery,
[1067.14 → 1069.06] bow down before you,
[1069.32 → 1070.60] not recognizing you,
[1070.60 → 1072.42] but you recognize them
[1072.42 → 1075.02] and you remember.
[1075.66 → 1077.00] How could you possibly
[1077.00 → 1079.60] ever really forget?
[1082.22 → 1083.66] And wouldn't you want
[1083.66 → 1085.16] a little revenge?
[1086.54 → 1087.84] Wouldn't there be a voice
[1087.84 → 1088.44] in your head
[1088.44 → 1089.38] telling you to give them
[1089.38 → 1090.10] what they deserve,
[1090.24 → 1090.82] make them pay
[1090.82 → 1091.92] for what they put you through?
[1092.92 → 1093.84] Wouldn't you be tempted
[1093.84 → 1094.64] to mess with them
[1094.64 → 1095.72] just a little bit
[1095.72 → 1098.28] or at least get in their face
[1098.28 → 1098.66] and say,
[1098.78 → 1099.70] do you know how much pain
[1099.70 → 1100.90] you have caused me?
[1101.12 → 1102.34] Do you have any idea
[1102.34 → 1103.82] what the last 20 years
[1103.82 → 1104.64] of my life
[1104.64 → 1105.76] have been like?
[1110.40 → 1111.50] Amazingly, however,
[1112.36 → 1114.18] it is grace
[1114.18 → 1115.78] that is on Joseph's mind.
[1115.78 → 1118.16] Even though it comes
[1118.16 → 1119.56] in the form of a sort of
[1119.56 → 1120.42] what I would call
[1120.42 → 1121.60] holy revenge.
[1122.86 → 1124.40] Because in every detail
[1124.40 → 1125.28] of the story,
[1125.66 → 1126.92] Joseph gives his brothers
[1126.92 → 1128.96] a taste of what they did
[1128.96 → 1129.44] to him
[1129.44 → 1131.26] by putting them
[1131.26 → 1132.76] in the same sort
[1132.76 → 1133.60] of circumstances
[1133.60 → 1135.10] into which they had placed
[1135.10 → 1135.88] Joseph.
[1137.94 → 1138.48] One,
[1139.68 → 1140.90] he accuses them
[1140.90 → 1141.44] of coming
[1141.44 → 1142.42] to spy out
[1142.42 → 1143.32] where the land of Egypt
[1143.32 → 1144.26] is unprotected,
[1144.26 → 1146.14] but what he literally says,
[1147.50 → 1148.60] shades of the false
[1148.60 → 1149.62] accusation Joseph
[1149.62 → 1150.22] had suffered
[1150.22 → 1151.34] from Mrs. Rotifer,
[1151.76 → 1153.06] what he literally says
[1153.06 → 1154.32] is that they have come
[1154.32 → 1155.18] to violate
[1155.18 → 1156.62] the nakedness
[1156.62 → 1157.36] of the land.
[1159.14 → 1160.32] For a second thing,
[1160.40 → 1161.38] they all spend time
[1161.38 → 1161.88] in prison.
[1162.86 → 1163.60] In all likelihood,
[1163.78 → 1164.48] the same prison
[1164.48 → 1165.08] where Joseph
[1165.08 → 1165.72] had spent
[1165.72 → 1166.96] the precious years
[1166.96 → 1167.82] of his youth.
[1168.80 → 1169.94] For a third thing,
[1170.02 → 1170.88] he binds Satan
[1170.88 → 1171.80] before their eyes
[1171.80 → 1172.30] as he sends
[1172.30 → 1172.96] the rest of them
[1172.96 → 1173.96] back to Canaan.
[1173.96 → 1175.64] and just as Joseph himself
[1175.64 → 1176.34] had been bound
[1176.34 → 1177.38] by the slave traders.
[1178.38 → 1179.88] And for a fourth thing,
[1180.58 → 1181.30] he returns
[1181.30 → 1182.40] each man's silver,
[1183.34 → 1183.92] a reminder
[1183.92 → 1184.84] of his own
[1184.84 → 1185.96] purchase price.
[1187.18 → 1188.42] And because he is
[1188.42 → 1189.92] only human after all,
[1189.98 → 1190.64] it is hard
[1190.64 → 1192.14] to believe,
[1192.92 → 1193.88] or it is not
[1193.88 → 1194.64] hard to believe,
[1195.32 → 1196.12] that he might have
[1196.12 → 1197.18] enjoyed this
[1197.18 → 1198.02] holy revenge
[1198.02 → 1200.12] just a little bit.
[1200.12 → 1203.42] still,
[1203.58 → 1206.46] it is a holy revenge
[1206.46 → 1208.34] because the goal
[1208.34 → 1210.02] is not payback.
[1211.16 → 1212.54] What Joseph seeks
[1212.54 → 1214.06] is reconciliation.
[1214.06 → 1216.06] And reconciliation,
[1217.80 → 1219.06] genuine reconciliation,
[1220.68 → 1221.80] as South Africa
[1221.80 → 1223.36] recognized when it
[1223.36 → 1224.62] appointed the Truth
[1224.62 → 1226.44] and Reconciliation Commission
[1226.44 → 1227.76] to deal with the
[1227.76 → 1228.74] terrible abuses
[1228.74 → 1229.44] that happened
[1229.44 → 1231.46] during apartheid,
[1232.28 → 1233.20] and as our own
[1233.20 → 1233.52] country,
[1233.68 → 1234.04] Canada,
[1234.20 → 1235.58] recognized when it
[1235.58 → 1236.74] appointed a similar
[1236.74 → 1238.86] commission in 2008
[1238.86 → 1240.06] to deal with the
[1240.06 → 1241.34] painful and awful
[1241.34 → 1242.32] legacy of the
[1242.32 → 1243.40] residential schools
[1243.40 → 1244.62] among our country's
[1244.62 → 1245.72] indigenous people,
[1246.52 → 1248.10] genuine reconciliation
[1248.10 → 1249.78] cannot happen
[1249.78 → 1252.04] without truth.
[1252.04 → 1255.74] Joseph wants the
[1255.74 → 1256.16] truth.
[1257.56 → 1258.48] He wants to test
[1258.48 → 1259.06] the character
[1259.06 → 1259.76] of his brothers.
[1260.68 → 1261.36] He wants to know
[1261.36 → 1262.06] their heart,
[1262.88 → 1264.18] not for the sake
[1264.18 → 1264.88] of revenge,
[1265.02 → 1265.82] but for the sake
[1265.82 → 1266.16] of,
[1266.64 → 1267.42] with the goal
[1267.42 → 1267.86] of,
[1268.52 → 1269.16] reconciliation.
[1272.08 → 1273.44] We can only imagine,
[1273.58 → 1274.38] some of us perhaps
[1274.38 → 1275.30] better than others,
[1275.54 → 1276.48] the mixed feelings
[1276.48 → 1277.74] Joseph must have had
[1277.74 → 1278.72] as his past
[1278.72 → 1279.28] came back
[1279.28 → 1280.20] into his present.
[1280.20 → 1281.96] But if there is
[1281.96 → 1282.64] one thing
[1282.64 → 1284.00] both his past
[1284.00 → 1284.72] and his present
[1284.72 → 1285.76] had taught Joseph
[1285.76 → 1286.36] by now,
[1286.52 → 1287.66] it was to always
[1287.66 → 1288.52] see the bigger
[1288.52 → 1289.06] picture,
[1290.56 → 1292.74] God's picture.
[1294.34 → 1295.68] And that bigger
[1295.68 → 1296.12] picture,
[1296.34 → 1297.24] both in Genesis
[1297.24 → 1298.52] and in the whole
[1298.52 → 1298.96] Bible,
[1299.20 → 1299.84] and the key
[1299.84 → 1300.80] to understanding
[1300.80 → 1301.92] Joseph's actions
[1301.92 → 1303.08] is the promise
[1303.08 → 1303.74] of God
[1303.74 → 1304.68] to Abraham
[1304.68 → 1305.60] to bless him
[1305.60 → 1306.46] and his descendants
[1306.46 → 1307.66] and through them
[1307.66 → 1308.82] to bless all
[1308.82 → 1309.40] the peoples
[1309.40 → 1310.30] of the earth.
[1312.42 → 1313.42] The tip-off
[1313.42 → 1314.30] is verse 9,
[1314.96 → 1315.60] when Joseph's
[1315.60 → 1316.16] brothers bowed
[1316.16 → 1316.64] before him
[1316.64 → 1317.28] and then it says,
[1317.66 → 1318.14] then Joseph
[1318.14 → 1318.94] remembered
[1318.94 → 1320.24] his dream
[1320.24 → 1321.08] about them.
[1321.94 → 1322.54] And you know
[1322.54 → 1323.56] what dreams he meant,
[1323.90 → 1324.40] don't you?
[1325.40 → 1325.96] You go back
[1325.96 → 1326.60] to the beginning
[1326.60 → 1327.66] of Joseph's story,
[1328.22 → 1329.34] Genesis 37,
[1329.60 → 1330.50] verses 7,
[1330.92 → 1331.56] verse 9,
[1331.94 → 1332.74] about his brothers
[1332.74 → 1333.86] sheaves of grain
[1333.86 → 1334.86] bowing down
[1334.86 → 1335.64] to Joseph's
[1335.64 → 1336.36] sheave of grain,
[1336.60 → 1337.38] about the sun
[1337.38 → 1337.94] and the moon
[1337.94 → 1339.08] and the 11 stars
[1339.08 → 1340.12] bowing down
[1340.12 → 1341.02] to Joseph.
[1341.74 → 1342.94] Dreams that echo
[1342.94 → 1343.90] God's promise
[1343.90 → 1344.80] to Abraham
[1344.80 → 1345.92] that looked forward
[1345.92 → 1347.06] also to the day
[1347.06 → 1348.40] when Abraham's
[1348.40 → 1349.52] great-grandson
[1349.52 → 1351.08] is indeed blessed
[1351.08 → 1352.04] and through him
[1352.04 → 1353.24] all peoples
[1353.24 → 1353.96] in Egypt
[1353.96 → 1355.16] and on the earth.
[1355.16 → 1358.54] it is the moment
[1358.54 → 1359.50] when more than ever
[1359.50 → 1360.76] before,
[1360.90 → 1361.82] up till now,
[1362.08 → 1362.78] Joseph sees
[1362.78 → 1364.26] two important things.
[1365.56 → 1367.04] He sees his brothers
[1367.04 → 1367.94] in light
[1367.94 → 1369.42] of God's purpose
[1369.42 → 1370.08] for him
[1370.08 → 1371.80] as instruments
[1371.80 → 1372.54] in the hands
[1372.54 → 1373.04] of God.
[1374.40 → 1375.78] And seeing his brothers
[1375.78 → 1376.40] that way,
[1377.04 → 1377.98] he sees that
[1377.98 → 1378.96] if there is any
[1378.96 → 1379.68] hell to pay,
[1380.44 → 1381.98] it is God's business
[1381.98 → 1382.80] to see to it,
[1382.80 → 1384.18] not his.
[1386.06 → 1387.74] Joseph sees his brothers
[1387.74 → 1389.16] in light of God's purpose
[1389.16 → 1389.68] for him,
[1390.64 → 1391.54] realizing more
[1391.54 → 1393.02] than ever before,
[1393.78 → 1394.98] both because of them
[1394.98 → 1396.06] and in spite of them,
[1396.90 → 1397.96] he is living
[1397.96 → 1398.84] the reality
[1398.84 → 1400.04] of God's plan
[1400.04 → 1401.20] for him.
[1401.20 → 1403.82] What an incredibly
[1403.82 → 1404.48] twisted,
[1405.26 → 1406.40] painful road
[1406.40 → 1406.88] it's been,
[1407.80 → 1408.64] dumped in a pit,
[1408.80 → 1409.66] sold into slavery,
[1409.82 → 1410.74] locked into prison.
[1410.74 → 1412.64] But here today,
[1412.76 → 1413.64] Joseph is the number
[1413.64 → 1415.00] two man in Egypt,
[1415.36 → 1416.12] really the number
[1416.12 → 1416.72] two man
[1416.72 → 1418.20] in that civilized world.
[1419.54 → 1420.58] And Joseph could only
[1420.58 → 1421.32] look at his brothers
[1421.32 → 1422.02] and say,
[1422.76 → 1423.66] they were tools,
[1424.54 → 1425.76] they were instruments
[1425.76 → 1427.80] in the hand of God.
[1428.00 → 1428.76] They were part
[1428.76 → 1429.78] of God's means
[1429.78 → 1430.74] and God's method
[1430.74 → 1431.68] to work out
[1431.68 → 1432.46] his plan
[1432.46 → 1433.02] and purpose
[1433.02 → 1434.08] for my life
[1434.08 → 1436.06] and let it go.
[1436.06 → 1440.48] easy to say,
[1440.56 → 1441.00] of course,
[1441.52 → 1443.04] but not always
[1443.04 → 1443.74] easy to do.
[1444.98 → 1445.42] And yet,
[1445.56 → 1446.78] this is the perspective
[1446.78 → 1449.02] we need especially
[1449.02 → 1450.36] as followers
[1450.36 → 1450.96] of Jesus.
[1452.60 → 1453.40] This is how
[1453.40 → 1454.18] we need to think
[1454.18 → 1455.60] about that spouse
[1455.60 → 1456.04] who said,
[1456.16 → 1457.16] till death do us part
[1457.16 → 1458.84] and then left
[1458.84 → 1459.52] long before.
[1461.32 → 1462.48] The business partner
[1462.48 → 1463.10] who left you
[1463.10 → 1464.54] in serious financial straits
[1464.54 → 1465.30] when he cheated you
[1465.30 → 1465.86] out of your money.
[1466.96 → 1467.90] That child who
[1467.90 → 1468.80] in all these years
[1468.80 → 1469.52] hasn't expressed
[1469.52 → 1470.46] an ounce of gratitude.
[1471.88 → 1472.60] The parent
[1472.60 → 1473.26] who's never there
[1473.26 → 1473.68] for you.
[1474.76 → 1475.36] The friend
[1475.36 → 1476.28] who so violated
[1476.28 → 1477.46] your trust.
[1479.48 → 1480.40] What would you do
[1480.40 → 1481.08] if you had them
[1481.08 → 1482.82] at a point of need?
[1484.40 → 1485.32] What would you do
[1485.32 → 1485.94] if you had them
[1485.94 → 1486.52] over a barrel?
[1489.44 → 1490.18] Joseph's story
[1490.18 → 1491.34] teaches us to see
[1491.34 → 1492.84] those people
[1492.84 → 1493.58] in light of
[1493.58 → 1494.40] the bigger picture
[1494.40 → 1496.42] as instruments.
[1496.56 → 1497.32] However sinful,
[1497.50 → 1498.66] however disobedient,
[1499.08 → 1500.18] however wrongly
[1500.18 → 1501.06] and unfairly
[1501.06 → 1502.06] and unjustly
[1502.06 → 1502.70] and contrary
[1502.70 → 1503.66] to the will of God
[1503.66 → 1504.10] they may have
[1504.10 → 1504.68] treated you
[1504.68 → 1507.50] in God's hands.
[1508.96 → 1510.22] As part of God's
[1510.22 → 1511.32] means to work out
[1511.32 → 1511.90] his purposes
[1511.90 → 1512.72] for your life
[1512.72 → 1513.64] and for mine.
[1514.74 → 1515.88] Oh, it may be hard.
[1516.44 → 1517.02] It may be
[1517.02 → 1518.36] almost impossible
[1518.36 → 1518.94] at times
[1518.94 → 1519.84] to see God
[1519.84 → 1520.18] at work
[1520.18 → 1521.06] keeping his promise
[1521.06 → 1521.88] even through people
[1521.88 → 1522.56] who have caused
[1522.56 → 1523.52] both you and God
[1523.52 → 1524.14] pain.
[1525.00 → 1525.98] I get that.
[1527.04 → 1527.98] Maybe you'll never
[1527.98 → 1529.04] see it as clearly
[1529.04 → 1529.82] as Joseph did
[1529.82 → 1530.32] at least not
[1530.32 → 1531.26] this side of the grave.
[1532.48 → 1533.54] But then part of
[1533.54 → 1534.24] being a Christian
[1534.24 → 1535.66] on this side
[1535.66 → 1536.24] of the grave
[1536.24 → 1537.28] is that we live
[1537.28 → 1538.10] by faith
[1538.10 → 1539.32] rather than by sight.
[1541.32 → 1542.18] Joseph's story
[1542.18 → 1543.40] encourages us
[1543.40 → 1545.34] by faith
[1545.34 → 1546.98] to thank God
[1546.98 → 1549.56] not for all circumstances
[1549.56 → 1551.76] but in all circumstances
[1551.76 → 1553.26] and to believe
[1553.26 → 1554.02] that somehow
[1554.02 → 1555.32] even people
[1555.32 → 1556.26] who have caused
[1556.26 → 1557.24] or are causing you
[1557.24 → 1558.40] pain in your life
[1558.40 → 1560.64] can and will be used
[1560.64 → 1561.30] by God
[1561.30 → 1562.80] to mould
[1562.80 → 1563.92] and shape you
[1563.92 → 1564.70] into the kind
[1564.70 → 1565.30] of person
[1565.30 → 1566.10] blessed
[1566.10 → 1567.14] and being a blessing
[1567.14 → 1569.10] God intends
[1569.10 → 1569.88] for you to be.
[1571.96 → 1572.92] Because he saw
[1572.92 → 1574.40] that bigger picture
[1574.40 → 1575.94] Joseph saw his brothers
[1575.94 → 1576.62] as instruments
[1576.62 → 1577.28] in the hands
[1577.28 → 1578.34] of a faithful God.
[1578.34 → 1579.98] a God
[1579.98 → 1580.52] who could
[1580.52 → 1581.30] and can
[1581.30 → 1582.06] shoot straight
[1582.06 → 1583.68] with crooked arrows.
[1585.68 → 1586.52] And seeing that
[1586.52 → 1587.72] Joseph was determined
[1587.72 → 1589.86] to forego revenge.
[1590.42 → 1591.02] Vengeance
[1591.02 → 1592.78] is God's business
[1592.78 → 1593.90] not his
[1593.90 → 1595.78] not ours
[1595.78 → 1597.40] not mine.
[1598.90 → 1599.56] Joseph could not
[1599.56 → 1600.34] live in a world
[1600.34 → 1601.04] where
[1601.04 → 1603.04] evils of the past
[1603.04 → 1606.12] became the main factor
[1606.12 → 1607.22] that shaped
[1607.22 → 1608.06] his present.
[1608.34 → 1610.34] in the long run
[1610.34 → 1611.60] none of us
[1611.60 → 1612.42] can live that way.
[1613.18 → 1613.74] In an eye
[1613.74 → 1614.44] for an eye
[1614.44 → 1614.74] world
[1614.74 → 1615.12] everybody
[1615.12 → 1616.02] sooner or later
[1616.02 → 1616.78] ends up blind.
[1618.62 → 1619.56] If the hurts
[1619.56 → 1620.14] and the evils
[1620.14 → 1620.78] of the past
[1620.78 → 1621.90] become the primary
[1621.90 → 1622.66] guiding
[1622.66 → 1623.28] and shaping
[1623.28 → 1623.72] force
[1623.72 → 1624.78] for your future
[1624.78 → 1627.18] then none of us
[1627.18 → 1628.62] have a very bright future.
[1629.98 → 1630.64] That's true
[1630.64 → 1631.40] in our relationship
[1631.40 → 1632.04] with God
[1632.04 → 1633.82] it's just as true
[1633.82 → 1634.88] in our relationships
[1634.88 → 1636.22] with each other.
[1637.88 → 1638.80] Do you remember
[1638.80 → 1639.80] what Jesus once said?
[1641.26 → 1642.46] Love your enemies
[1642.46 → 1644.56] and pray for those
[1644.56 → 1645.54] who persecute you
[1645.54 → 1646.76] that you may be
[1646.76 → 1648.42] sons and daughters
[1648.42 → 1649.10] of your Father
[1649.10 → 1649.66] in heaven.
[1650.66 → 1651.50] He causes
[1651.50 → 1651.92] his Son
[1651.92 → 1652.42] to rise
[1652.42 → 1652.98] on the evil
[1652.98 → 1653.52] and the good
[1653.52 → 1654.40] on the Jews
[1654.40 → 1655.40] and on the Egyptians
[1655.40 → 1656.84] and sends rain
[1656.84 → 1658.10] on the righteous
[1658.10 → 1659.66] and the unrighteous.
[1660.84 → 1661.74] Too often
[1661.74 → 1662.90] those words of Jesus
[1662.90 → 1664.48] are drowned out
[1664.48 → 1665.42] by the cries
[1665.42 → 1666.34] for revenge
[1666.34 → 1667.80] in each of us.
[1669.02 → 1669.92] We know
[1669.92 → 1671.02] how gratifying
[1671.02 → 1671.66] it can be
[1671.66 → 1673.14] to see those
[1673.14 → 1674.40] who have wronged us
[1674.40 → 1675.66] fall.
[1677.24 → 1678.38] But haven't we
[1678.38 → 1679.26] also learned
[1679.26 → 1681.36] if not in our own lives
[1681.36 → 1682.20] and in the lives
[1682.20 → 1682.88] of others
[1682.88 → 1683.80] and of nations
[1683.80 → 1685.84] that retaliation
[1685.84 → 1687.28] is never
[1687.28 → 1688.64] the end of the matter.
[1689.78 → 1691.20] It's only the beginning
[1691.20 → 1693.46] of an endless cycle
[1693.46 → 1694.84] of rage
[1694.84 → 1695.58] that only grows
[1695.58 → 1696.06] hotter
[1696.06 → 1697.40] and stronger
[1697.40 → 1699.06] with every new action
[1699.06 → 1700.50] and reaction.
[1702.28 → 1703.48] People in our world
[1703.48 → 1704.12] talk about
[1704.12 → 1705.38] revenge or retaliation
[1705.38 → 1706.12] as a way of
[1706.12 → 1707.46] getting even.
[1709.16 → 1710.66] But Jesus told us
[1710.66 → 1711.34] in his sermon
[1711.34 → 1711.98] on the mount
[1711.98 → 1713.32] not to resist
[1713.32 → 1714.24] an evil person.
[1714.74 → 1715.62] And Paul instructed
[1715.62 → 1716.14] the church
[1716.14 → 1717.22] in Romans 12
[1717.22 → 1718.58] not to return
[1718.58 → 1719.58] evil for evil
[1719.58 → 1720.64] because here is
[1720.64 → 1721.20] the problem
[1721.20 → 1722.62] with trying to get even.
[1722.98 → 1723.68] You never do.
[1724.96 → 1725.88] You never do.
[1726.94 → 1727.80] Returning evil
[1727.80 → 1728.34] for evil
[1728.34 → 1728.74] leaves you
[1728.74 → 1729.26] with a memory
[1729.26 → 1729.92] of two evils
[1729.92 → 1730.60] instead of one.
[1732.00 → 1732.98] More importantly
[1732.98 → 1733.58] revenge
[1733.58 → 1734.56] and retaliation
[1734.56 → 1735.72] almost always
[1735.72 → 1737.36] begin a chain reaction
[1737.36 → 1738.70] that gets worse
[1738.70 → 1740.42] as it goes along.
[1741.24 → 1742.56] It is a rare thing
[1742.56 → 1744.24] when two people
[1744.24 → 1744.94] weigh pain
[1744.94 → 1746.42] on the same scale.
[1746.58 → 1748.16] Any hurt I cause you
[1748.16 → 1749.94] will always feel
[1749.94 → 1750.48] worse to you
[1750.48 → 1751.40] than it does to me.
[1752.60 → 1753.58] The two don't
[1753.58 → 1754.40] balance out
[1754.40 → 1754.90] and so
[1754.90 → 1756.80] you never get even.
[1758.16 → 1758.88] An insult
[1758.88 → 1759.48] is returned
[1759.48 → 1760.34] by a shove,
[1760.42 → 1760.88] is returned
[1760.88 → 1761.62] by a punch
[1761.62 → 1762.24] in the face,
[1762.52 → 1763.02] is returned
[1763.02 → 1763.92] by a knockdown
[1763.92 → 1764.74] and several kicks
[1764.74 → 1765.28] in the head,
[1765.56 → 1766.12] is returned
[1766.12 → 1767.28] by getting one's friends
[1767.28 → 1768.26] and ganging up
[1768.26 → 1768.76] on the other
[1768.76 → 1769.84] which finally leads
[1769.84 → 1770.44] to somebody
[1770.44 → 1771.34] pulling on a knife
[1771.34 → 1771.88] or a gun
[1771.88 → 1773.36] with deadly consequences.
[1776.08 → 1776.60] Revenge,
[1777.92 → 1778.98] wrote Lewis Shades,
[1779.34 → 1780.14] locks you
[1780.14 → 1782.20] into an escalation
[1782.20 → 1783.24] of evil
[1783.24 → 1785.68] and the only way
[1785.68 → 1786.14] to get off
[1786.14 → 1786.86] that escalator
[1786.86 → 1788.30] for evil
[1788.30 → 1789.12] to be overcome
[1789.12 → 1790.48] is not
[1790.48 → 1791.76] passive
[1791.76 → 1793.30] non-resistance
[1793.30 → 1795.70] but active
[1795.70 → 1797.38] non-resistance
[1797.38 → 1798.82] an active
[1798.82 → 1799.68] deed
[1799.68 → 1800.72] of grace
[1800.72 → 1802.28] on your part.
[1803.52 → 1804.52] That doesn't
[1804.52 → 1805.04] guarantee
[1805.04 → 1805.98] no more evil.
[1806.28 → 1807.02] It might not
[1807.02 → 1807.60] be fair
[1807.60 → 1808.94] but the alternative
[1808.94 → 1809.96] more evil
[1809.96 → 1811.88] is far worse.
[1814.36 → 1815.58] There are times
[1815.58 → 1816.54] when it is important
[1816.54 → 1818.16] to stand up
[1818.16 → 1818.86] for our rights.
[1820.24 → 1821.32] There are times
[1821.32 → 1822.08] when we are injured
[1822.08 → 1823.40] and justice
[1823.40 → 1824.38] must be sought.
[1825.46 → 1826.38] There are times
[1826.38 → 1826.76] and others
[1826.76 → 1827.48] take advantage
[1827.48 → 1828.00] of us
[1828.00 → 1829.16] and it's necessary
[1829.16 → 1830.28] to seek damages.
[1832.00 → 1832.82] We should not
[1832.82 → 1833.32] misunderstand
[1833.32 → 1834.30] Jesus' words
[1834.30 → 1835.08] as an invitation
[1835.08 → 1836.24] to live as doormats.
[1838.38 → 1839.44] There are times
[1839.44 → 1840.06] and occasions
[1840.06 → 1841.96] when the right
[1841.96 → 1842.60] thing to do
[1842.60 → 1844.16] is to fight
[1844.16 → 1844.92] against the wrong
[1844.92 → 1845.48] being done
[1845.48 → 1846.22] against you
[1846.22 → 1847.26] or someone else
[1847.26 → 1848.24] but there is
[1848.24 → 1848.72] never
[1848.72 → 1850.70] a good
[1850.70 → 1851.60] or right time
[1851.60 → 1853.58] for revenge.
[1854.84 → 1855.36] Payback
[1855.36 → 1857.06] trying to get
[1857.06 → 1857.40] even.
[1859.58 → 1860.58] So how do we
[1860.58 → 1860.98] deal with
[1860.98 → 1861.76] past things
[1861.76 → 1862.80] we cannot
[1862.80 → 1863.32] forget?
[1864.92 → 1866.04] Is there a way
[1866.04 → 1867.00] to remember
[1867.00 → 1867.56] them without
[1867.56 → 1868.40] allowing them
[1868.40 → 1869.24] to dictate
[1869.24 → 1870.78] our lives?
[1872.46 → 1873.32] There is.
[1874.32 → 1875.06] And it comes
[1875.06 → 1876.06] only by the grace
[1876.06 → 1876.76] and the power
[1876.76 → 1877.42] of God.
[1878.42 → 1879.26] It comes
[1879.26 → 1879.92] only by
[1879.92 → 1880.66] constantly
[1880.66 → 1881.94] being aware
[1881.94 → 1884.30] of the big
[1884.30 → 1884.82] picture
[1884.82 → 1885.74] we see
[1885.74 → 1886.40] even more
[1886.40 → 1886.78] clearly
[1886.78 → 1887.46] than Joseph
[1887.46 → 1887.80] could
[1887.80 → 1888.16] and by
[1888.16 → 1888.80] answering
[1888.80 → 1889.92] the question
[1889.92 → 1890.32] that the
[1890.32 → 1891.14] brothers asked
[1891.14 → 1891.92] at one point
[1891.92 → 1893.32] in Genesis 42
[1893.32 → 1894.38] when they open
[1894.38 → 1895.34] a bag of grain
[1895.34 → 1896.24] and discover
[1896.24 → 1897.28] that their silver
[1897.28 → 1898.08] has been returned
[1898.08 → 1898.52] to them.
[1898.88 → 1899.60] This question,
[1899.82 → 1901.10] what is this
[1901.10 → 1903.24] that God
[1903.24 → 1904.22] has done
[1904.22 → 1904.84] to us?
[1904.84 → 1908.06] their thinking
[1908.06 → 1908.74] at that point
[1908.74 → 1909.38] was that God
[1909.38 → 1910.06] was punishing
[1910.06 → 1910.84] them for
[1910.84 → 1911.42] their past
[1911.42 → 1911.98] evils.
[1913.76 → 1914.68] But we know
[1914.68 → 1915.02] better.
[1916.36 → 1917.16] We know
[1917.16 → 1917.56] what they
[1917.56 → 1917.98] don't yet
[1917.98 → 1918.32] know.
[1919.28 → 1920.06] That God
[1920.06 → 1920.80] through Joseph
[1920.80 → 1921.44] was seeking
[1921.44 → 1922.22] their healing
[1922.22 → 1923.96] and reconciliation.
[1924.82 → 1925.46] A healing
[1925.46 → 1926.48] and reconciliation
[1926.48 → 1927.64] that for Abraham
[1927.64 → 1928.28] and his
[1928.28 → 1928.78] descendants
[1928.78 → 1929.42] in the days
[1929.42 → 1930.00] of Joseph
[1930.00 → 1930.86] was only
[1930.86 → 1931.78] yet a promise
[1931.78 → 1933.44] but that
[1933.44 → 1933.98] for us
[1933.98 → 1934.90] is reality
[1934.90 → 1936.36] as we sang
[1936.36 → 1936.92] this morning
[1936.92 → 1938.24] in the cross
[1938.24 → 1939.34] of Jesus Christ
[1939.34 → 1940.86] the Lamb of God
[1940.86 → 1942.12] who takes away
[1942.12 → 1943.14] the sin
[1943.14 → 1943.66] of the world.
[1945.10 → 1946.10] The power
[1946.10 → 1946.78] of the past
[1946.78 → 1947.32] for Joseph
[1947.32 → 1947.86] and us
[1947.86 → 1949.72] is undeniably
[1949.72 → 1950.24] strong.
[1951.16 → 1951.94] It is
[1951.94 → 1952.90] unimaginably
[1952.90 → 1953.50] stronger
[1953.50 → 1954.90] for God.
[1956.08 → 1956.72] Listen,
[1957.84 → 1958.64] if God
[1958.64 → 1959.54] remembers
[1959.54 → 1960.76] everything
[1960.76 → 1962.94] God
[1962.94 → 1963.08] can you
[1963.08 → 1963.56] even
[1963.56 → 1963.98] begin
[1963.98 → 1965.10] to imagine
[1965.10 → 1966.32] how terribly
[1966.32 → 1966.98] God
[1966.98 → 1968.32] must suffer?
[1970.16 → 1970.80] How can
[1970.80 → 1971.40] God
[1971.40 → 1972.30] possibly
[1972.30 → 1972.92] endure
[1972.92 → 1974.12] the world
[1974.12 → 1975.00] if God
[1975.00 → 1975.56] remembers
[1975.56 → 1976.34] as clearly
[1976.34 → 1976.98] as if it
[1976.98 → 1977.80] were yesterday
[1977.80 → 1979.14] all the
[1979.14 → 1979.52] evils
[1979.52 → 1980.18] ever
[1980.18 → 1980.92] perpetrated
[1980.92 → 1981.72] by every
[1981.72 → 1982.16] nation
[1982.16 → 1983.06] and every
[1983.06 → 1983.52] person
[1983.52 → 1984.28] that ever
[1984.28 → 1984.62] lived
[1984.62 → 1984.98] and that
[1984.98 → 1985.60] lives today?
[1988.02 → 1989.04] How does
[1989.04 → 1989.90] even God
[1989.90 → 1990.34] deal
[1990.34 → 1991.54] with that
[1991.54 → 1992.04] entire
[1992.04 → 1992.66] universe
[1992.66 → 1993.34] of past
[1993.34 → 1993.72] evil
[1993.72 → 1993.98] without
[1993.98 → 1994.30] just
[1994.30 → 1995.44] lashing out
[1995.44 → 1996.44] at every
[1996.44 → 1997.00] one
[1997.00 → 1997.94] of us
[1997.94 → 1999.62] and every
[1999.62 → 2000.30] person on
[2000.30 → 2000.64] earth
[2000.64 → 2001.64] once and
[2001.64 → 2002.14] for all?
[2003.50 → 2004.34] But you
[2004.34 → 2004.66] know,
[2005.22 → 2006.42] you know
[2006.42 → 2006.82] how he
[2006.82 → 2007.24] does.
[2008.84 → 2009.62] God too,
[2009.76 → 2010.48] once as he
[2010.48 → 2011.12] looked ahead,
[2012.06 → 2012.92] now as he
[2012.92 → 2013.72] looks back,
[2014.64 → 2015.48] holds in his
[2015.48 → 2015.98] memory,
[2016.66 → 2017.30] above all,
[2017.30 → 2018.44] the cross
[2018.44 → 2019.98] of Jesus
[2019.98 → 2020.48] Christ.
[2021.94 → 2022.86] As God
[2022.86 → 2023.82] remembers that
[2023.82 → 2024.30] and we
[2024.30 → 2024.70] are not
[2024.70 → 2025.20] destroyed,
[2026.32 → 2027.22] so must
[2027.22 → 2027.50] we.
[2028.50 → 2029.08] Remember
[2029.08 → 2029.72] that any
[2029.72 → 2030.38] and every
[2030.38 → 2031.16] evil ever
[2031.16 → 2031.68] done to
[2031.68 → 2032.56] you have
[2032.56 → 2033.12] itself
[2033.12 → 2033.66] already
[2033.66 → 2034.28] been taken
[2034.28 → 2035.20] up into
[2035.20 → 2035.80] God
[2035.80 → 2036.74] through the
[2036.74 → 2037.36] suffering from
[2037.36 → 2038.24] Jesus for
[2038.24 → 2038.64] the sin
[2038.64 → 2038.90] of the
[2038.90 → 2039.18] world.
[2041.06 → 2041.76] Remembering
[2041.76 → 2042.34] that may
[2042.34 → 2043.18] not erase
[2043.18 → 2044.08] your memory.
[2044.08 → 2045.60] it may
[2045.60 → 2045.82] not,
[2045.94 → 2046.28] in this
[2046.28 → 2046.80] life at
[2046.80 → 2047.06] least,
[2047.58 → 2048.04] eliminate
[2048.04 → 2048.68] every
[2048.68 → 2049.08] twinge
[2049.08 → 2049.58] of pain,
[2049.94 → 2050.20] every
[2050.20 → 2050.78] temptation
[2050.78 → 2051.60] to take
[2051.60 → 2052.20] revenge.
[2052.70 → 2052.92] But
[2052.92 → 2053.60] perhaps,
[2054.60 → 2055.58] perhaps it
[2055.58 → 2056.06] helps to
[2056.06 → 2056.50] remember
[2056.50 → 2057.70] that someone
[2057.70 → 2058.60] bigger,
[2059.34 → 2059.74] better,
[2060.40 → 2060.98] stronger,
[2061.52 → 2062.16] more gracious
[2062.16 → 2062.74] than you
[2062.74 → 2063.18] or I
[2063.18 → 2064.90] has dealt
[2064.90 → 2065.30] with our
[2065.30 → 2066.44] hurts and
[2066.44 → 2067.10] will continue
[2067.10 → 2067.48] to deal
[2067.48 → 2067.82] with them
[2067.82 → 2068.48] until that
[2068.48 → 2068.92] day when
[2068.92 → 2069.96] every tear
[2069.96 → 2070.28] will be
[2070.28 → 2070.64] wiped
[2070.64 → 2071.36] from our
[2071.36 → 2071.72] eyes,
[2072.08 → 2072.84] every old
[2072.84 → 2073.46] enemy will
[2073.46 → 2074.38] be reconciled
[2074.38 → 2075.24] and every
[2075.24 → 2076.10] bad memory
[2076.10 → 2076.62] will be
[2076.62 → 2077.98] deprived of
[2077.98 → 2078.66] its power
[2078.66 → 2079.64] to hurt
[2079.64 → 2080.76] anymore.
[2084.22 → 2085.06] In the
[2085.06 → 2085.66] courtroom of
[2085.66 → 2086.02] the Truth
[2086.02 → 2086.82] and Reconciliation
[2086.82 → 2087.52] Commission
[2087.52 → 2088.10] one day,
[2089.10 → 2089.80] the shock
[2089.80 → 2090.14] of the
[2090.14 → 2091.20] amazing grace
[2091.20 → 2092.22] in the
[2092.22 → 2092.68] lives of
[2092.68 → 2093.04] one of
[2093.04 → 2093.42] God's
[2093.42 → 2093.90] children
[2093.90 → 2095.28] was so
[2095.28 → 2095.86] great as
[2095.86 → 2096.20] to make
[2096.20 → 2097.02] a perpetrator
[2097.02 → 2098.24] of unimaginable
[2098.24 → 2098.72] evil
[2098.72 → 2099.70] faint
[2099.70 → 2100.58] dead
[2100.58 → 2100.94] away.
[2103.46 → 2104.48] Perhaps
[2104.48 → 2105.34] nobody
[2105.34 → 2105.84] started
[2105.84 → 2106.32] singing
[2106.32 → 2106.78] amazing
[2106.78 → 2107.24] grace
[2107.24 → 2108.96] the day
[2108.96 → 2109.60] Joseph's
[2109.60 → 2110.06] brothers
[2110.06 → 2110.48] faced
[2110.48 → 2110.98] Joseph
[2110.98 → 2111.86] for the
[2111.86 → 2112.38] first time
[2112.38 → 2112.82] since they
[2112.82 → 2113.26] sold him
[2113.26 → 2113.88] into slavery
[2113.88 → 2114.48] over 20
[2114.48 → 2115.66] years earlier.
[2116.82 → 2117.86] The truth
[2117.86 → 2118.16] is,
[2118.36 → 2118.78] Joseph's
[2118.78 → 2119.32] actions
[2119.32 → 2120.68] in measures
[2120.68 → 2121.36] that made
[2121.36 → 2122.04] his brothers
[2122.04 → 2122.60] relive
[2122.60 → 2123.54] his own
[2123.54 → 2123.92] painful
[2123.92 → 2124.64] experiences
[2124.64 → 2125.80] might better
[2125.80 → 2126.56] be called
[2126.56 → 2127.92] severe
[2127.92 → 2128.42] grace
[2128.42 → 2130.04] rather than
[2130.04 → 2131.34] amazing
[2131.34 → 2131.84] grace.
[2131.84 → 2131.94] grace.
[2132.94 → 2133.74] But for
[2133.74 → 2134.14] all of
[2134.14 → 2134.42] that,
[2135.16 → 2135.80] it is
[2135.80 → 2136.56] still
[2136.56 → 2137.48] grace.
[2138.48 → 2139.12] Grace
[2139.12 → 2139.56] by which
[2139.56 → 2139.92] the ten
[2139.92 → 2140.30] brothers,
[2140.94 → 2141.38] like the
[2141.38 → 2141.82] prodigal
[2141.82 → 2142.30] son in
[2142.30 → 2142.52] Jesus'
[2142.70 → 2143.04] well-known
[2143.04 → 2143.54] parable,
[2144.18 → 2144.86] begin to
[2144.86 → 2145.40] come to
[2145.40 → 2146.18] their senses
[2146.18 → 2147.90] by openly
[2147.90 → 2149.02] if unknowingly
[2149.02 → 2149.96] confessing
[2149.96 → 2150.42] their sin
[2150.42 → 2150.96] before the
[2150.96 → 2151.66] very brother
[2151.66 → 2152.06] they had
[2152.06 → 2152.54] wronged
[2152.54 → 2154.28] and by
[2154.28 → 2154.94] recognizing
[2154.94 → 2155.72] the powerful
[2155.72 → 2156.28] hand of
[2156.28 → 2156.58] God
[2156.58 → 2157.38] orchestrating
[2157.38 → 2158.14] the events
[2158.14 → 2159.04] of their
[2159.04 → 2159.52] lives.
[2159.52 → 2161.12] and the
[2161.12 → 2161.58] door to
[2161.58 → 2162.04] God's
[2162.04 → 2162.70] new future
[2162.70 → 2163.72] of blessing
[2163.72 → 2164.18] for his
[2164.18 → 2164.56] children
[2164.56 → 2165.84] is opened
[2165.84 → 2167.08] even if
[2167.08 → 2168.36] only a
[2168.36 → 2168.74] crack
[2168.74 → 2169.92] as yet.
[2171.62 → 2172.66] For now,
[2173.54 → 2174.42] that is
[2174.42 → 2175.16] amazing
[2175.16 → 2176.42] enough
[2176.42 → 2176.90] grace.
[2178.22 → 2178.66] Already
[2178.66 → 2179.24] now you
[2179.24 → 2179.76] can hear
[2179.76 → 2180.70] the Spirit
[2180.70 → 2181.28] of God
[2181.28 → 2181.64] humming
[2181.64 → 2182.32] the tune.
[2183.74 → 2184.08] Everyone
[2184.08 → 2184.90] just hasn't
[2184.90 → 2185.34] caught on
[2185.34 → 2185.58] yet
[2185.58 → 2187.36] and hasn't
[2187.36 → 2187.80] joined in
[2187.80 → 2188.06] yet,
[2188.76 → 2189.50] but they
[2189.50 → 2189.76] will.
[2190.88 → 2191.12] And
[2191.12 → 2192.02] knowing the
[2192.02 → 2192.64] bigger picture,
[2193.46 → 2194.48] not in
[2194.48 → 2194.90] Joseph,
[2195.66 → 2196.46] but in
[2196.46 → 2196.80] Jesus,
[2198.12 → 2199.26] so will
[2199.26 → 2199.52] you,
[2200.18 → 2200.66] won't you?
[2201.56 → 2202.44] In the name
[2202.44 → 2202.72] of the
[2202.72 → 2203.32] Father and
[2203.32 → 2203.72] the Son
[2203.72 → 2204.98] and the
[2204.98 → 2205.52] Holy Spirit.
[2205.52 → 2205.62] Amen.
