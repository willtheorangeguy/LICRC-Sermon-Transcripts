[0.00 --> 6.58]  and just by way of reminder two weeks ago as you know Joseph finally revealed himself to his
[6.58 --> 13.04]  brothers and the whole clan the whole kit and caboodle moved to Egypt and now it's a number
[13.04 --> 19.64]  of years later Jacob has just finished blessing all of his sons and then he says to them and
[19.64 --> 26.00]  that's the beginning of our reading in Genesis 49 then Jacob gave them these instructions
[26.00 --> 30.10]  I think you had the wrong reading up there
[30.10 --> 34.74]  yeah 49 should be 49 verse
[34.74 --> 45.68]  yeah that's the wrong reading okay so I'm just gonna maybe you want to take that off sorry folks
[45.68 --> 50.92]  I thought that had been correct let's just listen then Jacob gave them these instructions
[50.92 --> 57.72]  I am about to be gathered to my people bury me with my fathers in the cave in the field of Ephron
[57.72 --> 65.36]  the Hittite the cave in the field of Machpelah near Mamre in Canaan which Abraham bought along with
[65.36 --> 72.48]  the field as a burial place from Ephron the Hittite there Abraham and his wife Sarah were buried
[72.48 --> 80.18]  there Isaac and his wife Rebecca were buried and there I buried Leah the field and the cave in it
[80.18 --> 87.14]  were brought from the Hittites when Jacob had finished giving instructions to his sons he drew
[87.14 --> 95.50]  his feet up into the bed breathed his last and was gathered to his people Joseph threw himself on his
[95.50 --> 103.60]  father and wept over him and kissed him then Joseph directed the physicians in his service to embalm his
[103.60 --> 111.88]  father Israel so the physicians embalm him taking a full 40 days for that was the time required for
[111.88 --> 121.50]  embalming and the Egyptians mourned for him 70 days when the days of mourning had passed Joseph said to
[121.50 --> 129.44]  Pharaoh's court if I have found favor in your eyes speak to Pharaoh for me tell father made me swear an oath
[129.44 --> 137.78]  and said I am about to die bury me in the tomb I dug for myself in the land of Canaan now let me go up
[137.78 --> 145.88]  and bury my father I will return Pharaoh said go up and bury your father as he made you swear to do
[145.88 --> 153.56]  so Jacob's sons did as he had commanded them they carried him to the land of Canaan and they buried him
[153.56 --> 159.70]  in the cave in the field of Machmela near Mamre him had bought along with the field as a burial place
[159.70 --> 167.02]  from Ephron the Hittite after burying his father Joseph returned to Egypt together with his brothers
[167.02 --> 175.98]  and all the others who had gone with him to bury his father Joseph stayed in Egypt along with all his
[175.98 --> 185.38]  father's family he lived 110 years and saw the third generation of Ephraim's children also the children of
[185.38 --> 195.24]  Machir son of Manasseh were placed at birth on Joseph's knees then Joseph said to his brothers I am about to die
[195.24 --> 203.90]  but God and take you up out of this land to the land he promised on oath to Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[203.90 --> 215.16]  swear an oath and said God will surely come to your aid and then you must carry my bones up from this place
[215.16 --> 225.50]  so Joseph died at the age of 110 and after they embalmed him he was placed in Egypt
[225.50 --> 235.48]  and then this New Testament reading one verse Hebrews 11 verse 17 the chapter on the heroes of faith
[235.48 --> 242.64]  where we read this by faith Joseph when spoke about the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt
[242.64 --> 250.88]  and gave instructions concerning the burial of his bones this is the word of the Lord
[250.88 --> 264.92]  in a time of deep despair in South Africa when there was no sign anywhere in that sad land yet of a better
[264.92 --> 279.22]  future for black people Archbishop Desmond Tutu spoke to a group of white leaders who had the power to see to it
[279.22 --> 288.74]  that what Tutu so deeply hoped for would never happen and this is what he said to them and I quote
[288.74 --> 299.10]  in the enveloping darkness as the lights of freedom are extinguished one by one I have come here to say evil
[299.10 --> 312.70]  and injustice and oppression and exploitation cannot prevail you may be very powerful but you are not God
[312.70 --> 323.04]  in fact you have already lost we are inviting you to come and join the winning side
[323.04 --> 336.52]  this is the message that we as Christians need to hear over and over in a culture and world that ignores and or denies God
[336.52 --> 341.66]  where it is very hard to be optimistic about the future
[341.66 --> 346.28]  listen if you are a Christian
[346.28 --> 349.64]  you are on the winning side
[349.64 --> 353.04]  God is going to win
[353.04 --> 356.84]  life is going to win over death
[356.84 --> 358.40]  love is
[358.40 --> 359.76]  and indifference
[359.76 --> 363.64]  peace is going to win over terror and violence
[363.64 --> 366.92]  righteousness is going to win over injustice
[366.92 --> 370.30]  good is going to win over evil
[370.30 --> 372.60]  so don't ever
[372.60 --> 373.72]  ever
[373.72 --> 374.96]  give up hope
[374.96 --> 376.66]  not for people
[376.66 --> 377.38]  for yourself
[377.38 --> 379.04]  not for the church
[379.04 --> 380.72]  not for the world
[380.72 --> 382.78]  not for God
[382.78 --> 387.18]  such hope is what today's text
[387.18 --> 388.24]  is all about
[388.24 --> 390.88]  although on the surface it sure
[390.88 --> 392.16]  doesn't look like it
[392.16 --> 395.68]  we have come to the end of the Joseph story
[395.68 --> 397.50]  and not only of the Joseph story
[397.50 --> 399.86]  but also of the book of Genesis
[399.86 --> 403.90]  and on the surface what a sad
[403.90 --> 406.36]  anticlimactic
[406.36 --> 408.06]  hopeless end
[408.06 --> 414.06]  the book that begins with nothing less
[414.06 --> 417.62]  than the creation of the entire universe
[417.62 --> 419.74]  and all things living
[419.74 --> 421.48]  ends
[421.48 --> 423.24]  in a pine box
[423.24 --> 424.86]  with death
[424.86 --> 427.08]  first
[427.08 --> 428.16]  Jacob dies
[428.16 --> 429.26]  and Joseph
[429.26 --> 430.10]  dies
[430.10 --> 430.80]  too
[430.80 --> 434.88]  remember the very first words
[434.88 --> 436.18]  almost the very first words
[436.18 --> 437.00]  of the book of Genesis
[437.00 --> 438.40]  God said
[438.40 --> 439.80]  let there
[439.80 --> 440.50]  be
[440.50 --> 441.36]  light
[441.36 --> 443.16]  and you imagine
[443.16 --> 444.70]  this explosion of light
[444.70 --> 445.68]  in the universe
[445.68 --> 446.78]  that was so dark
[446.78 --> 450.32]  the very last words
[450.32 --> 451.58]  in Genesis are
[451.58 --> 454.06]  Joseph was placed
[454.06 --> 455.18]  in a coffin
[455.18 --> 456.52]  in Egypt
[456.52 --> 458.54]  and can you think of
[458.54 --> 459.64]  a darker place
[459.64 --> 461.24]  than a coffin
[461.24 --> 465.62]  if that doesn't sound
[465.62 --> 466.68]  hopeless enough
[466.68 --> 468.74]  remember that you have to see
[468.74 --> 469.62]  Joseph's story
[469.62 --> 471.40]  along with all Genesis
[471.40 --> 473.10]  in light of God's covenant
[473.10 --> 474.56]  promise to Abraham
[474.56 --> 477.18]  a promise that included
[477.18 --> 478.52]  descendants as numerous
[478.52 --> 480.16]  as the stars in the sky
[480.16 --> 483.00]  and the land of their own
[483.00 --> 485.22]  but in the end
[485.22 --> 487.28]  Jacob is buried
[487.28 --> 489.64]  in the cave of Machpelah
[489.64 --> 490.82]  in Canaan
[490.82 --> 493.14]  a graveyard owned
[493.14 --> 494.78]  by grandfather Abraham
[494.78 --> 497.18]  the only piece
[497.18 --> 498.66]  of the promised land
[498.66 --> 500.54]  to which Abraham
[500.54 --> 501.30]  held title
[501.30 --> 502.96]  when he died
[502.96 --> 505.76]  in the end
[505.76 --> 506.98]  God's people
[506.98 --> 508.22]  are from Canaan
[508.22 --> 510.22]  living in Egypt
[510.22 --> 511.98]  in the end
[511.98 --> 513.52]  Joseph's body
[513.52 --> 514.28]  is placed
[514.28 --> 515.50]  in a coffin
[515.50 --> 517.06]  in Egypt
[517.06 --> 520.22]  where on earth
[520.22 --> 521.56]  is hope
[521.56 --> 523.60]  at the end of Genesis
[523.60 --> 527.44]  well that depends
[527.44 --> 528.40]  on your perspective
[528.40 --> 530.62]  and what we need
[530.62 --> 531.46]  is the perspective
[531.46 --> 532.78]  of the New Testament
[532.78 --> 535.60]  Joseph is mentioned
[535.60 --> 536.74]  four times
[536.74 --> 537.56]  in the New Testament
[537.56 --> 539.14]  twice
[539.14 --> 540.16]  his name alone
[540.16 --> 540.68]  is mentioned
[540.68 --> 541.44]  in passing
[541.44 --> 543.90]  and in Acts 7
[543.90 --> 544.94]  in Stephen's speech
[544.94 --> 545.64]  to the Jewish
[545.64 --> 546.64]  religious leaders
[546.64 --> 548.26]  before they convict
[548.26 --> 548.82]  and kill him
[548.82 --> 549.60]  for his faith
[549.60 --> 551.56]  the facts
[551.56 --> 552.70]  of Joseph's story
[552.70 --> 554.66]  are briefly summarized
[554.66 --> 556.86]  then there is
[556.86 --> 557.34]  Hebrews
[557.34 --> 559.02]  chapter 11
[559.02 --> 560.50]  part of that
[560.50 --> 561.62]  long chapter
[561.62 --> 562.96]  about all the heroes
[562.96 --> 563.50]  of faith
[563.50 --> 565.84]  the only
[565.84 --> 566.58]  New Testament
[566.58 --> 567.18]  passage
[567.18 --> 568.14]  which comments
[568.14 --> 570.10]  on Joseph's character
[570.10 --> 571.70]  and then
[571.70 --> 573.40]  he gets just
[573.40 --> 574.54]  one verse
[574.54 --> 577.22]  but what a verse
[577.22 --> 577.68]  it is
[577.68 --> 578.34]  listen
[578.34 --> 580.26]  by faith
[580.26 --> 580.82]  Joseph
[580.82 --> 582.30]  when his end
[582.30 --> 582.88]  was near
[582.88 --> 584.42]  spoke about
[584.42 --> 585.10]  the exodus
[585.10 --> 585.96]  of the Israelites
[585.96 --> 586.88]  from Egypt
[586.88 --> 589.00]  and gave instructions
[589.00 --> 590.70]  about his bones
[590.70 --> 593.82]  it is such
[593.82 --> 594.60]  a striking
[594.60 --> 595.42]  verse
[595.42 --> 595.96]  isn't it
[595.96 --> 597.02]  I mean
[597.02 --> 597.56]  Genesis
[597.56 --> 598.18]  devotes
[598.18 --> 600.08]  13 chapters
[600.08 --> 601.62]  to Joseph's story
[601.62 --> 603.56]  and while he's not
[603.56 --> 603.96]  perfect
[603.96 --> 604.72]  in Joseph's
[604.72 --> 605.14]  character
[605.14 --> 605.66]  in life
[605.66 --> 606.46]  we see this
[606.46 --> 607.54]  incredible picture
[607.54 --> 608.20]  of faithful
[608.20 --> 608.58]  obedience
[608.58 --> 609.20]  love
[609.20 --> 610.16]  and forgiveness
[610.16 --> 611.16]  in the kind
[611.16 --> 611.84]  of extreme
[611.84 --> 612.74]  circumstances
[612.74 --> 613.54]  most of us
[613.54 --> 614.52]  will never know
[614.52 --> 617.34]  Joseph is one
[617.34 --> 617.76]  of the most
[617.76 --> 619.06]  winsome characters
[619.06 --> 619.52]  I think
[619.52 --> 620.10]  in the Bible
[620.10 --> 622.22]  yet he gets
[622.22 --> 623.42]  only one verse
[623.42 --> 626.58]  in the New Testament
[626.58 --> 628.30]  and the only
[628.30 --> 629.10]  thing for which
[629.10 --> 629.62]  the writer
[629.62 --> 630.16]  of Hebrews
[630.16 --> 630.88]  goes out
[630.88 --> 631.28]  of his way
[631.28 --> 631.76]  to commend
[631.76 --> 632.26]  Joseph
[632.26 --> 634.30]  are his
[634.30 --> 635.12]  dying words
[635.12 --> 637.40]  by faith
[637.40 --> 637.88]  Joseph
[637.88 --> 638.52]  when his end
[638.52 --> 639.06]  was near
[639.06 --> 640.40]  spoke about
[640.40 --> 641.06]  the exodus
[641.06 --> 641.92]  of the Israelites
[641.92 --> 642.90]  from Egypt
[642.90 --> 643.96]  and gave
[643.96 --> 644.82]  instructions
[644.82 --> 645.88]  about his
[645.88 --> 646.30]  bones
[646.30 --> 650.50]  but then
[650.50 --> 652.06]  to use
[652.06 --> 652.90]  the first
[652.90 --> 654.28]  four words
[654.28 --> 656.48]  that Rick Warren
[656.48 --> 657.42]  passed in California
[657.42 --> 659.84]  that he wrote
[659.84 --> 661.12]  in his 2002
[661.12 --> 662.22]  best-selling book
[662.22 --> 663.68]  The Purpose Driven Life
[663.68 --> 665.32]  the first four words
[665.32 --> 665.86]  were
[665.86 --> 667.98]  it's not
[667.98 --> 669.72]  about you
[669.72 --> 672.66]  it's not
[672.66 --> 673.58]  about you
[673.58 --> 675.56]  it's not
[675.56 --> 676.66]  about me
[676.66 --> 677.34]  either
[677.34 --> 679.90]  it is about
[679.90 --> 681.22]  the bigger picture
[681.22 --> 681.92]  it is about
[681.92 --> 682.44]  God
[682.44 --> 683.36]  it is about
[683.36 --> 684.32]  God's purpose
[684.32 --> 685.14]  for and through
[685.14 --> 685.60]  Joseph
[685.60 --> 687.08]  God's purpose
[687.08 --> 687.92]  for and through
[687.92 --> 688.76]  you and me
[688.76 --> 690.10]  God's purpose
[690.10 --> 691.24]  for and through
[691.24 --> 692.04]  his church
[692.04 --> 693.42]  God's purpose
[693.42 --> 694.44]  for his world
[694.44 --> 696.92]  it's about
[696.92 --> 697.76]  God's promise
[697.76 --> 698.34]  to bless
[698.34 --> 698.80]  Abraham
[698.80 --> 700.20]  and his descendants
[700.20 --> 700.72]  and through
[700.72 --> 701.46]  to bless
[701.46 --> 702.36]  all people
[702.36 --> 702.80]  on earth
[702.80 --> 703.44]  and all
[703.44 --> 704.20]  means
[704.20 --> 705.12]  all
[705.12 --> 709.02]  that remains
[709.02 --> 710.52]  front and center
[710.52 --> 711.48]  especially
[711.48 --> 712.30]  at the end
[712.30 --> 713.06]  of this story
[713.06 --> 715.20]  father Jacob
[715.20 --> 715.92]  is dead
[715.92 --> 717.68]  and according
[717.68 --> 718.50]  to his request
[718.50 --> 719.18]  he is buried
[719.18 --> 720.10]  in the land
[720.10 --> 721.24]  of God's promise
[721.24 --> 722.18]  Canaan
[722.18 --> 724.26]  and now
[724.26 --> 725.70]  56 years later
[725.70 --> 727.22]  Joseph
[727.22 --> 727.76]  has come
[727.76 --> 728.32]  to the end
[728.32 --> 729.38]  of his life
[729.38 --> 731.70]  and he remembers
[731.70 --> 732.94]  these words
[732.94 --> 734.28]  spoken to
[734.28 --> 734.64]  great
[734.64 --> 735.32]  grandfather
[735.32 --> 735.96]  Abraham
[735.96 --> 737.14]  words
[737.14 --> 737.84]  rehearsed
[737.84 --> 738.84]  passed down
[738.84 --> 739.58]  from one
[739.58 --> 740.12]  generation
[740.12 --> 741.20]  to the next
[741.20 --> 743.22]  these words
[743.22 --> 744.46]  from Genesis 15
[744.46 --> 746.30]  know for certain
[746.30 --> 748.40]  that your descendants
[748.40 --> 749.44]  will be strangers
[749.44 --> 750.38]  in a country
[750.38 --> 751.56]  not their own
[751.56 --> 753.00]  and this
[753.00 --> 753.36]  treated
[753.36 --> 754.86]  400 years
[754.86 --> 756.94]  but I will punish
[756.94 --> 757.50]  the nation
[757.50 --> 758.14]  they serve
[758.14 --> 758.72]  as slaves
[758.72 --> 759.74]  and afterward
[759.74 --> 760.84]  they will come
[760.84 --> 761.14]  out
[761.14 --> 762.32]  with great
[762.32 --> 762.84]  possessions
[762.84 --> 766.72]  we are not
[766.72 --> 767.10]  told
[767.10 --> 768.34]  if it was
[768.34 --> 769.02]  faith alone
[769.02 --> 770.22]  or faith
[770.22 --> 770.70]  and fact
[770.70 --> 771.14]  together
[771.14 --> 772.64]  that made
[772.64 --> 773.44]  Joseph focus
[773.44 --> 773.90]  on this
[773.90 --> 774.70]  old promise
[774.70 --> 775.48]  that was
[775.48 --> 776.08]  generations
[776.08 --> 776.58]  old
[776.58 --> 777.60]  and generations
[777.60 --> 779.02]  from fulfillment
[779.02 --> 781.70]  Joseph had been
[781.70 --> 782.18]  in Egypt
[782.18 --> 782.56]  now
[782.56 --> 784.10]  for 93
[784.10 --> 785.12]  years
[785.12 --> 787.08]  his family
[787.08 --> 788.60]  for 73
[788.60 --> 789.14]  years
[789.14 --> 790.98]  the famine
[790.98 --> 791.84]  was long
[791.84 --> 792.26]  over
[792.26 --> 793.66]  Joseph had
[793.66 --> 794.12]  no doubt
[794.12 --> 794.96]  long since
[794.96 --> 795.52]  retired
[795.52 --> 796.98]  and at the
[796.98 --> 797.56]  time of his
[797.56 --> 797.80]  death
[797.80 --> 798.28]  the children
[798.28 --> 798.84]  of Israel
[798.84 --> 799.46]  were not
[799.46 --> 800.16]  yet slaves
[800.16 --> 801.12]  or prisoners
[801.12 --> 801.94]  in Egypt
[801.94 --> 803.88]  all we know
[803.88 --> 804.62]  is that Joseph
[804.62 --> 806.00]  somehow knew
[806.00 --> 806.52]  the truth
[806.52 --> 806.94]  of what
[806.94 --> 807.70]  Exodus 1
[807.70 --> 808.20]  verse 8
[808.20 --> 809.10]  tells us
[809.10 --> 810.18]  that a new
[810.18 --> 810.54]  king
[810.54 --> 812.00]  who did not
[812.00 --> 812.80]  know Joseph
[812.80 --> 814.08]  would come
[814.08 --> 815.18]  to power
[815.18 --> 816.14]  and that
[816.14 --> 816.60]  everything
[816.60 --> 817.66]  would change
[817.66 --> 819.12]  for the worse
[819.12 --> 821.08]  that hardship
[821.08 --> 821.86]  was coming
[821.86 --> 822.80]  for his
[822.80 --> 823.22]  brothers
[823.22 --> 824.68]  slavery
[824.68 --> 825.80]  for his
[825.80 --> 826.16]  people
[826.16 --> 827.96]  we also
[827.96 --> 828.50]  know that
[828.50 --> 828.80]  Joseph
[828.80 --> 829.48]  believes
[829.48 --> 830.62]  all of the
[830.62 --> 831.06]  promises
[831.06 --> 832.28]  that the
[832.28 --> 832.72]  end
[832.72 --> 833.82]  will be
[833.82 --> 834.22]  glory
[834.22 --> 836.46]  I am
[836.46 --> 837.32]  about to
[837.32 --> 837.66]  die
[837.66 --> 838.20]  he tells
[838.20 --> 838.68]  his brothers
[838.68 --> 840.16]  but God
[840.16 --> 840.98]  will surely
[840.98 --> 841.96]  come to
[841.96 --> 842.50]  your aid
[842.50 --> 843.80]  that is
[843.80 --> 844.14]  you will
[844.14 --> 844.74]  need to
[844.74 --> 845.28]  be rescued
[845.28 --> 845.92]  by God
[845.92 --> 846.60]  and God
[846.60 --> 847.30]  will rescue
[847.30 --> 847.64]  you
[847.64 --> 848.34]  and take
[848.34 --> 848.74]  you up
[848.74 --> 849.16]  out of
[849.16 --> 849.64]  this land
[849.64 --> 850.30]  to the
[850.30 --> 850.74]  land he
[850.74 --> 851.28]  promised
[851.28 --> 852.02]  on oath
[852.02 --> 852.66]  to Abraham
[852.66 --> 853.28]  Isaac
[853.28 --> 854.10]  and Jacob
[854.10 --> 857.06]  then Joseph
[857.06 --> 857.64]  makes his
[857.64 --> 858.70]  family swear
[858.70 --> 859.22]  an oath
[859.22 --> 860.60]  and with his
[860.60 --> 861.48]  very last
[861.48 --> 861.86]  words
[861.86 --> 862.36]  says
[862.36 --> 863.58]  God
[863.58 --> 864.46]  will surely
[864.46 --> 865.06]  come to
[865.06 --> 865.60]  your aid
[865.60 --> 866.98]  and then
[866.98 --> 867.54]  you must
[867.54 --> 868.14]  carry my
[868.14 --> 868.70]  bones up
[868.70 --> 869.66]  from this
[869.66 --> 870.10]  place
[870.10 --> 872.58]  so
[872.58 --> 872.94]  Joseph
[872.94 --> 873.42]  died
[873.42 --> 875.60]  and
[875.60 --> 876.28]  verse 26
[876.28 --> 877.10]  tells us
[877.10 --> 878.10]  after they
[878.10 --> 878.72]  embalmed
[878.72 --> 879.00]  him
[879.00 --> 880.04]  he was
[880.04 --> 880.72]  placed in
[880.72 --> 881.22]  a coffin
[881.22 --> 882.34]  in Egypt
[882.34 --> 884.78]  they
[884.78 --> 885.36]  embalmed
[885.36 --> 885.64]  him
[885.64 --> 887.74]  they
[887.74 --> 888.22]  don't
[888.22 --> 889.08]  bury
[889.08 --> 889.48]  him
[889.48 --> 891.64]  why not
[891.64 --> 892.08]  because
[892.08 --> 892.74]  they're
[892.74 --> 893.46]  supposed to
[893.46 --> 893.86]  carry
[893.86 --> 894.82]  his bones
[894.82 --> 895.40]  out when
[895.40 --> 895.88]  they go
[895.88 --> 897.26]  because
[897.26 --> 897.66]  God
[897.66 --> 898.10]  is coming
[898.10 --> 898.48]  for them
[898.48 --> 899.10]  to rescue
[899.10 --> 899.42]  them
[899.42 --> 899.98]  and they
[899.98 --> 900.44]  need to
[900.44 --> 900.86]  be ready
[900.86 --> 901.42]  to pick
[901.42 --> 901.74]  up his
[901.74 --> 902.10]  bones
[902.10 --> 903.06]  and leave
[903.06 --> 904.52]  Joseph's
[904.52 --> 904.88]  coffin
[904.88 --> 905.44]  becomes
[905.44 --> 906.06]  a symbol
[906.06 --> 907.06]  of hope
[907.06 --> 907.68]  that the
[907.68 --> 908.10]  gathering
[908.10 --> 908.56]  storm
[908.56 --> 908.96]  that is
[908.96 --> 909.34]  coming
[909.34 --> 910.12]  slavery
[910.12 --> 910.44]  and
[910.44 --> 910.88]  hardship
[910.88 --> 911.72]  is not
[911.72 --> 912.10]  going to
[912.10 --> 912.74]  be terminal
[912.74 --> 913.38]  that the
[913.38 --> 913.78]  present
[913.78 --> 914.32]  darkness
[914.32 --> 915.12]  will not
[915.12 --> 915.78]  be forever
[915.78 --> 916.66]  don't
[916.66 --> 917.58]  bury me
[917.58 --> 918.00]  because
[918.00 --> 918.46]  God
[918.46 --> 918.86]  will come
[918.86 --> 919.14]  back
[919.14 --> 919.76]  for us
[919.76 --> 921.00]  and when
[921.00 --> 921.60]  you must
[921.60 --> 922.14]  carry my
[922.14 --> 922.42]  bones
[922.42 --> 922.84]  home
[922.84 --> 923.98]  and bury
[923.98 --> 924.34]  me
[924.34 --> 925.12]  in the
[925.12 --> 925.36]  land
[925.36 --> 925.52]  of
[925.52 --> 926.04]  promise
[926.04 --> 929.44]  you see
[929.44 --> 929.80]  the end
[929.80 --> 929.96]  of
[929.96 --> 930.34]  Genesis
[930.34 --> 931.78]  is all
[931.78 --> 932.08]  about
[932.08 --> 932.44]  hope
[932.44 --> 933.46]  after all
[933.46 --> 935.20]  and the
[935.20 --> 935.46]  Bible
[935.46 --> 936.18]  says a lot
[936.18 --> 936.74]  about hope
[936.74 --> 938.22]  that biblical
[938.22 --> 938.92]  hope does
[938.92 --> 939.74]  not disappoint
[939.74 --> 941.42]  that it's
[941.42 --> 941.76]  not an
[941.76 --> 942.06]  empty
[942.06 --> 942.54]  wish
[942.54 --> 943.70]  that biblical
[943.70 --> 944.44]  hope is a
[944.44 --> 945.10]  given because
[945.10 --> 945.58]  it is a
[945.58 --> 945.84]  hope
[945.84 --> 947.06]  in God
[947.06 --> 949.74]  Lewis
[949.74 --> 950.14]  Meads
[950.14 --> 950.86]  once pointed
[950.86 --> 951.14]  out
[951.14 --> 952.24]  that when
[952.24 --> 952.66]  it comes
[952.66 --> 953.22]  to ordinary
[953.22 --> 953.98]  human
[953.98 --> 954.44]  hoping
[954.44 --> 955.72]  there are
[955.72 --> 956.36]  three things
[956.36 --> 957.02]  going on
[957.02 --> 958.62]  one is
[958.62 --> 959.52]  desire
[959.52 --> 960.30]  we want
[960.30 --> 960.62]  what we
[960.62 --> 961.24]  hope for
[961.24 --> 964.16]  two is
[964.16 --> 965.06]  belief
[965.06 --> 966.78]  we believe
[966.78 --> 967.30]  that what we
[967.30 --> 967.70]  hope for
[967.70 --> 968.40]  is possible
[968.40 --> 970.26]  though not
[970.26 --> 970.72]  inevitable
[970.72 --> 972.80]  which leads
[972.80 --> 973.14]  to number
[973.14 --> 973.58]  three
[973.58 --> 974.90]  doubt
[974.90 --> 976.72]  we fear
[976.72 --> 977.10]  that what
[977.10 --> 977.58]  we hope
[977.58 --> 978.06]  for
[978.06 --> 979.34]  may not
[979.34 --> 979.64]  happen
[979.64 --> 981.38]  hope for
[981.38 --> 982.18]  the difference
[982.18 --> 982.84]  in Christian
[982.84 --> 983.44]  and biblical
[983.44 --> 983.92]  hope
[983.92 --> 986.58]  has to do
[986.58 --> 986.90]  with that
[986.90 --> 987.68]  third element
[987.68 --> 989.02]  doubt
[989.02 --> 991.36]  Christian hope
[991.36 --> 991.86]  is not
[991.86 --> 992.16]  evil
[992.16 --> 993.38]  it is a
[993.38 --> 994.06]  conviction
[994.06 --> 995.30]  about what
[995.30 --> 996.16]  is sure
[996.16 --> 997.22]  because it is
[997.22 --> 997.76]  a faith
[997.76 --> 998.86]  not in human
[998.86 --> 999.58]  possibility
[999.58 --> 1001.26]  but in God's
[1001.26 --> 1001.72]  promise
[1001.72 --> 1003.96]  that's why
[1003.96 --> 1004.72]  hope rules
[1004.72 --> 1005.22]  at the end
[1005.22 --> 1005.50]  of the
[1005.50 --> 1006.30]  Joseph story
[1006.30 --> 1006.98]  and at the
[1006.98 --> 1007.38]  end of
[1007.38 --> 1007.80]  Genesis
[1007.80 --> 1008.44]  even though
[1008.44 --> 1009.00]  we know
[1009.00 --> 1009.62]  when as
[1009.62 --> 1010.02]  Genesis
[1010.02 --> 1010.64]  closes
[1010.64 --> 1012.14]  hardship
[1012.14 --> 1013.58]  slavery
[1013.58 --> 1015.04]  brick making
[1015.04 --> 1015.98]  genocide
[1015.98 --> 1016.80]  through the
[1016.80 --> 1017.28]  murder of
[1017.28 --> 1017.66]  their male
[1017.66 --> 1018.08]  children
[1018.08 --> 1019.24]  one generation
[1019.24 --> 1020.46]  after another
[1020.46 --> 1021.80]  and yes
[1021.80 --> 1022.62]  all the while
[1022.62 --> 1023.28]  the silence
[1023.28 --> 1023.82]  of God
[1023.82 --> 1024.96]  is deafening
[1024.96 --> 1027.44]  there is no
[1027.44 --> 1027.92]  word from
[1027.92 --> 1028.26]  God
[1028.26 --> 1029.42]  there is no
[1029.42 --> 1030.10]  message from
[1030.10 --> 1030.42]  heaven
[1030.42 --> 1032.02]  and so
[1032.02 --> 1032.74]  where is the
[1032.74 --> 1033.52]  hope in all
[1033.52 --> 1034.00]  of this
[1034.00 --> 1037.08]  it is in
[1037.08 --> 1038.24]  Joseph's
[1038.24 --> 1038.66]  coffin
[1038.66 --> 1041.10]  Joseph's
[1041.10 --> 1041.52]  coffin
[1041.52 --> 1042.08]  becomes
[1042.08 --> 1042.98]  the message
[1042.98 --> 1043.58]  of hope
[1043.58 --> 1044.36]  it is the
[1044.36 --> 1045.06]  box if you
[1045.06 --> 1045.32]  will
[1045.32 --> 1046.42]  that speaks
[1046.42 --> 1048.00]  it is the
[1048.00 --> 1048.60]  symbol that
[1048.60 --> 1049.44]  says this
[1049.44 --> 1049.92]  suffering
[1049.92 --> 1050.72]  is not
[1050.72 --> 1051.18]  forever
[1051.18 --> 1052.94]  God has
[1052.94 --> 1053.64]  not forgotten
[1053.64 --> 1054.04]  you
[1054.04 --> 1055.00]  someday he
[1055.00 --> 1055.42]  will come
[1055.42 --> 1056.00]  back for
[1056.00 --> 1056.26]  you
[1056.26 --> 1057.26]  by faith
[1057.26 --> 1057.72]  Joseph
[1057.72 --> 1058.16]  when his
[1058.16 --> 1058.58]  end was
[1058.58 --> 1058.84]  near
[1058.84 --> 1059.80]  spoke about
[1059.80 --> 1060.46]  the exodus
[1060.46 --> 1060.82]  of the
[1060.82 --> 1061.26]  Israelites
[1061.26 --> 1061.88]  from Egypt
[1061.88 --> 1062.74]  and gave
[1062.74 --> 1063.44]  instructions
[1063.44 --> 1064.52]  about his
[1064.52 --> 1065.04]  bones
[1065.04 --> 1066.24]  as the
[1066.24 --> 1066.72]  children of
[1066.72 --> 1067.08]  Israel
[1067.08 --> 1067.70]  suffer
[1067.70 --> 1068.72]  year after
[1068.72 --> 1069.16]  year
[1069.16 --> 1070.04]  of awful
[1070.04 --> 1070.62]  slavery
[1070.62 --> 1071.34]  and life
[1071.34 --> 1072.02]  is hard
[1072.02 --> 1072.58]  and the
[1072.58 --> 1072.88]  future
[1072.88 --> 1073.22]  seems
[1073.22 --> 1073.88]  hopeless
[1073.88 --> 1076.08]  fathers
[1076.08 --> 1077.40]  and mothers
[1077.40 --> 1079.20]  will walk
[1079.20 --> 1079.78]  with sons
[1079.78 --> 1080.58]  and daughters
[1080.58 --> 1081.84]  past the
[1081.84 --> 1082.44]  place where
[1082.44 --> 1083.08]  the coffin
[1083.08 --> 1083.94]  lays
[1083.94 --> 1084.84]  and
[1084.84 --> 1085.42]  generation
[1085.42 --> 1085.78]  after
[1085.78 --> 1086.50]  generation
[1086.50 --> 1087.14]  will ask
[1087.14 --> 1088.06]  what does
[1088.06 --> 1088.72]  that box
[1088.72 --> 1089.36]  mean
[1089.36 --> 1091.40]  and fathers
[1091.40 --> 1092.00]  and mothers
[1092.00 --> 1093.06]  will tell
[1093.06 --> 1093.64]  their children
[1093.64 --> 1094.82]  as hard
[1094.82 --> 1095.22]  as life
[1095.22 --> 1095.56]  is
[1095.56 --> 1097.04]  as hopeless
[1097.04 --> 1097.78]  as the future
[1097.78 --> 1098.32]  seems
[1098.32 --> 1100.04]  this box
[1100.04 --> 1100.90]  this coffin
[1100.90 --> 1101.46]  means
[1101.46 --> 1102.40]  that one
[1102.40 --> 1103.02]  day soon
[1103.02 --> 1103.44]  we're gone
[1103.44 --> 1105.36]  we close
[1105.36 --> 1105.98]  with Joseph
[1105.98 --> 1106.74]  in a coffin
[1106.74 --> 1107.84]  in Egypt
[1107.84 --> 1109.30]  and from the
[1109.30 --> 1110.12]  outside looking
[1110.12 --> 1110.48]  in
[1110.48 --> 1112.30]  things don't
[1112.30 --> 1113.14]  look all that
[1113.14 --> 1113.48]  hopeful
[1113.48 --> 1115.70]  but the
[1115.70 --> 1116.46]  last verse
[1116.46 --> 1117.08]  of Genesis
[1117.08 --> 1118.66]  is part
[1118.66 --> 1118.92]  of this
[1118.92 --> 1119.54]  larger
[1119.54 --> 1120.00]  biblical
[1120.00 --> 1120.60]  story
[1120.60 --> 1121.72]  that lets
[1121.72 --> 1122.22]  us know
[1122.22 --> 1123.34]  this is
[1123.34 --> 1123.86]  not the
[1123.86 --> 1124.20]  end
[1124.20 --> 1125.90]  not by
[1125.90 --> 1126.62]  a long
[1126.62 --> 1127.06]  shot
[1127.06 --> 1128.26]  it isn't
[1128.26 --> 1130.16]  the road
[1130.16 --> 1130.68]  ahead will
[1130.68 --> 1131.08]  not be
[1131.08 --> 1131.44]  easy
[1131.44 --> 1133.00]  but some
[1133.00 --> 1134.42]  430 years
[1134.42 --> 1134.98]  Joseph was
[1134.98 --> 1135.50]  sold in
[1135.50 --> 1136.02]  Egypt as
[1136.02 --> 1136.52]  a slave
[1136.52 --> 1139.30]  God
[1139.30 --> 1139.90]  called up
[1139.90 --> 1140.46]  another
[1140.46 --> 1141.34]  deliverer
[1141.34 --> 1142.50]  Moses
[1142.50 --> 1144.20]  and as
[1144.20 --> 1144.62]  Moses
[1144.62 --> 1145.22]  leads the
[1145.22 --> 1145.72]  children of
[1145.72 --> 1146.10]  Israel
[1146.10 --> 1146.54]  out of
[1146.54 --> 1146.70]  their
[1146.70 --> 1147.08]  slavery
[1147.08 --> 1147.70]  in Egypt
[1147.70 --> 1148.70]  you read
[1148.70 --> 1149.18]  this in
[1149.18 --> 1150.24]  Exodus 13
[1150.24 --> 1151.18]  Moses
[1151.18 --> 1152.00]  took the
[1152.00 --> 1152.66]  bones of
[1152.66 --> 1153.02]  Joseph
[1153.02 --> 1154.10]  with him
[1154.10 --> 1155.62]  because
[1155.62 --> 1156.14]  Joseph
[1156.14 --> 1156.86]  had made
[1156.86 --> 1157.42]  the sons
[1157.42 --> 1157.98]  of Israel
[1157.98 --> 1159.10]  swear an
[1159.10 --> 1159.46]  oath
[1159.46 --> 1160.64]  he had
[1160.64 --> 1161.02]  said
[1161.02 --> 1161.80]  God
[1161.80 --> 1162.58]  will surely
[1162.58 --> 1163.04]  come to
[1163.04 --> 1163.62]  your aid
[1163.62 --> 1164.70]  and then
[1164.70 --> 1165.24]  you must
[1165.24 --> 1165.70]  carry
[1165.70 --> 1166.64]  my bones
[1166.64 --> 1167.26]  up with
[1167.26 --> 1167.60]  you
[1167.60 --> 1168.70]  from this
[1168.70 --> 1169.18]  place
[1169.18 --> 1172.14]  through 40
[1172.14 --> 1173.06]  years of
[1173.06 --> 1173.62]  their desert
[1173.62 --> 1174.48]  pilgrimage
[1174.48 --> 1176.32]  along with
[1176.32 --> 1177.14]  everything else
[1177.14 --> 1177.76]  they carried
[1177.76 --> 1178.20]  for their
[1178.20 --> 1178.58]  journey
[1178.58 --> 1180.54]  they carried
[1180.54 --> 1181.42]  that coffin
[1181.42 --> 1182.62]  through the
[1182.62 --> 1183.18]  Red Sea
[1183.18 --> 1184.62]  to the foot
[1184.62 --> 1184.98]  of Mount
[1184.98 --> 1185.42]  Sinai
[1185.42 --> 1185.92]  where God
[1185.92 --> 1186.38]  renewed
[1186.38 --> 1187.26]  his covenant
[1187.26 --> 1187.74]  with his
[1187.74 --> 1188.08]  people
[1188.08 --> 1189.68]  through years
[1189.68 --> 1190.44]  of doubts
[1190.44 --> 1191.24]  and murmuring
[1191.24 --> 1192.04]  and complaining
[1192.04 --> 1194.26]  through years
[1194.26 --> 1194.86]  of struggle
[1194.86 --> 1197.26]  until finally
[1197.26 --> 1197.68]  they took
[1197.68 --> 1198.18]  possession
[1198.18 --> 1198.66]  of the
[1198.66 --> 1199.10]  land of
[1199.10 --> 1199.50]  promise
[1199.50 --> 1200.22]  and at
[1200.22 --> 1200.62]  the end
[1200.62 --> 1201.06]  of the
[1201.06 --> 1201.46]  book of
[1201.46 --> 1201.86]  Joshua
[1201.86 --> 1202.60]  you read
[1202.60 --> 1203.36]  these words
[1203.36 --> 1204.70]  Joseph's
[1204.70 --> 1205.16]  bones
[1205.16 --> 1206.34]  which the
[1206.34 --> 1206.80]  Israelites
[1206.80 --> 1207.52]  had brought
[1207.52 --> 1207.88]  up from
[1207.88 --> 1208.32]  Egypt
[1208.32 --> 1210.00]  were buried
[1210.00 --> 1210.66]  at Shechem
[1210.66 --> 1211.62]  in the
[1211.62 --> 1212.28]  tract of
[1212.28 --> 1212.88]  land that
[1212.88 --> 1213.58]  Jacob bought
[1213.58 --> 1214.60]  for 100
[1214.60 --> 1215.42]  pieces of
[1215.42 --> 1215.82]  silver
[1215.82 --> 1216.82]  from the
[1216.82 --> 1217.24]  sons of
[1217.24 --> 1217.68]  Hamor
[1217.68 --> 1219.30]  this became
[1219.30 --> 1220.08]  the inheritance
[1220.08 --> 1221.78]  of Joseph's
[1221.78 --> 1222.78]  descendants
[1222.78 --> 1225.60]  no coffin
[1225.60 --> 1226.20]  in Egypt
[1226.20 --> 1227.42]  is going
[1227.42 --> 1228.08]  to stop
[1228.08 --> 1228.68]  the Lord
[1228.68 --> 1229.88]  God Almighty
[1229.88 --> 1230.66]  from fulfilling
[1230.66 --> 1231.42]  his promise
[1231.42 --> 1232.10]  to Abraham
[1232.10 --> 1233.04]  Isaac
[1233.04 --> 1233.96]  Jacob
[1233.96 --> 1235.78]  and Joseph
[1235.78 --> 1238.04]  nor will
[1238.04 --> 1238.78]  anything
[1238.78 --> 1239.58]  stop
[1239.58 --> 1240.44]  the Lord
[1240.44 --> 1241.60]  God Almighty
[1241.60 --> 1242.48]  from fulfilling
[1242.48 --> 1243.42]  his promise
[1243.42 --> 1244.50]  to us
[1244.50 --> 1246.84]  I know
[1246.84 --> 1247.34]  the people
[1247.34 --> 1247.76]  of God
[1247.76 --> 1248.06]  throughout
[1248.06 --> 1248.52]  history
[1248.52 --> 1249.02]  have had
[1249.02 --> 1249.54]  their share
[1249.54 --> 1250.04]  of hard
[1250.04 --> 1250.46]  times
[1250.46 --> 1250.82]  I know
[1250.82 --> 1251.28]  violence
[1251.28 --> 1251.94]  and terror
[1251.94 --> 1252.72]  of hunger
[1252.72 --> 1253.40]  and poverty
[1253.40 --> 1254.26]  of crime
[1254.26 --> 1255.00]  and immorality
[1255.00 --> 1255.66]  of sickness
[1255.66 --> 1256.40]  and pandemic
[1256.40 --> 1258.62]  I know
[1258.62 --> 1259.22]  that the evil
[1259.22 --> 1259.96]  and the injustice
[1259.96 --> 1260.74]  and the oppression
[1260.74 --> 1261.94]  and the exploitation
[1261.94 --> 1262.98]  that Archbishop
[1262.98 --> 1264.06]  Tutu spoke
[1264.06 --> 1264.72]  about still
[1264.72 --> 1265.28]  prevails
[1265.28 --> 1266.12]  in almost
[1266.12 --> 1267.08]  every corner
[1267.08 --> 1267.72]  of our world
[1267.72 --> 1268.82]  also frankly
[1268.82 --> 1269.84]  in our corner
[1269.84 --> 1270.64]  of the world
[1270.64 --> 1272.90]  I know
[1272.90 --> 1273.64]  that we are
[1273.64 --> 1274.28]  not winning
[1274.28 --> 1275.02]  the battle
[1275.02 --> 1275.98]  in our culture
[1275.98 --> 1276.56]  to reach
[1276.56 --> 1277.66]  the whole world
[1277.66 --> 1278.90]  for Jesus Christ
[1278.90 --> 1280.24]  all the adversity
[1280.24 --> 1281.06]  that the church
[1281.06 --> 1281.84]  has faced
[1281.84 --> 1282.58]  and that we face
[1282.58 --> 1283.64]  up to this day
[1283.64 --> 1284.62]  we don't have
[1284.62 --> 1285.38]  this box
[1285.38 --> 1286.04]  this coffin
[1286.04 --> 1287.36]  that talks to us
[1287.36 --> 1289.64]  we have no
[1289.64 --> 1290.64]  unburied bones
[1290.64 --> 1291.38]  to revive
[1291.38 --> 1292.38]  our flagging faith
[1292.38 --> 1295.98]  we have something
[1295.98 --> 1296.64]  far better
[1296.64 --> 1297.18]  don't we
[1297.18 --> 1299.28]  we have
[1299.28 --> 1301.02]  an empty grave
[1301.02 --> 1303.50]  an empty grave
[1303.50 --> 1304.54]  where the son of God
[1304.54 --> 1305.16]  on a Friday
[1305.16 --> 1306.22]  that was good for us
[1306.22 --> 1307.32]  but not very good
[1307.32 --> 1307.78]  for him
[1307.78 --> 1309.74]  because he died
[1309.74 --> 1311.76]  for our sin
[1311.76 --> 1313.60]  a grave
[1313.60 --> 1314.34]  now empty
[1314.34 --> 1315.72]  because on the third day
[1315.72 --> 1316.78]  he rose from the dead
[1316.78 --> 1318.48]  and walked out of that grave
[1318.48 --> 1319.68]  for our life
[1319.68 --> 1322.00]  we have an empty grave
[1322.00 --> 1323.10]  that reminds us
[1323.10 --> 1323.96]  that this earth
[1323.96 --> 1325.70]  is not our real home
[1325.70 --> 1327.74]  that God has prepared
[1327.74 --> 1328.74]  a better city
[1328.74 --> 1329.34]  for us
[1329.34 --> 1330.30]  a new heaven
[1330.30 --> 1331.40]  and a new earth
[1331.40 --> 1332.80]  the land of glory
[1332.80 --> 1334.74]  we have an empty grave
[1334.74 --> 1335.90]  to revive our hope
[1335.90 --> 1337.32]  that God is coming
[1337.32 --> 1338.66]  to our aid
[1338.66 --> 1340.00]  God is coming back
[1340.00 --> 1340.54]  for us
[1340.54 --> 1341.60]  God is coming
[1341.60 --> 1342.52]  to deliver us
[1342.52 --> 1343.56]  from our bondage
[1343.56 --> 1344.12]  to death
[1344.12 --> 1345.08]  and decay
[1345.08 --> 1346.16]  and the devil
[1346.16 --> 1349.10]  Genesis 50
[1349.10 --> 1349.48]  you see
[1349.48 --> 1350.22]  is far
[1350.22 --> 1351.06]  from the end
[1351.06 --> 1351.70]  of the story
[1351.70 --> 1352.74]  it is only the end
[1352.74 --> 1353.10]  of the book
[1353.10 --> 1353.72]  of Genesis
[1353.72 --> 1355.48]  Moses still has
[1355.48 --> 1356.28]  four more books
[1356.28 --> 1356.88]  to write
[1356.88 --> 1357.98]  and the spirit
[1357.98 --> 1358.60]  of God
[1358.60 --> 1360.12]  has 61
[1360.12 --> 1361.32]  more to write
[1361.32 --> 1362.70]  before the final
[1362.70 --> 1363.56]  chapter
[1363.56 --> 1364.78]  is written
[1364.78 --> 1367.22]  listen
[1367.22 --> 1368.48]  Revelation
[1368.48 --> 1369.76]  21
[1369.76 --> 1372.24]  these familiar words
[1372.24 --> 1373.66]  then I saw
[1373.66 --> 1374.44]  a new heaven
[1374.44 --> 1375.90]  and a new earth
[1375.90 --> 1377.90]  for the first heaven
[1377.90 --> 1379.16]  and the first earth
[1379.16 --> 1380.12]  had passed away
[1380.12 --> 1381.30]  and there was no longer
[1381.30 --> 1382.28]  any sea
[1382.28 --> 1384.42]  I saw the holy city
[1384.42 --> 1385.54]  the new Jerusalem
[1385.54 --> 1386.76]  coming down
[1386.76 --> 1387.28]  out of heaven
[1387.28 --> 1387.92]  from God
[1387.92 --> 1389.32]  prepared as a bride
[1389.32 --> 1390.58]  beautifully dressed
[1390.58 --> 1391.46]  for her husband
[1391.46 --> 1393.22]  and I heard
[1393.22 --> 1394.26]  a loud voice
[1394.26 --> 1394.94]  from the throne
[1394.94 --> 1395.48]  saying
[1395.48 --> 1397.04]  now the dwelling
[1397.04 --> 1397.64]  of God
[1397.64 --> 1398.64]  is with men
[1398.64 --> 1400.34]  and he will live
[1400.34 --> 1400.80]  with them
[1400.80 --> 1401.84]  they will be
[1401.84 --> 1402.52]  his people
[1402.52 --> 1403.90]  and God himself
[1403.90 --> 1404.92]  will be with them
[1404.92 --> 1406.20]  and be their God
[1406.20 --> 1407.20]  he will wipe
[1407.20 --> 1408.22]  every tear
[1408.22 --> 1409.28]  from their eyes
[1409.28 --> 1410.74]  there will be
[1410.74 --> 1411.58]  no more death
[1411.58 --> 1412.72]  or mourning
[1412.72 --> 1414.52]  or crying
[1414.52 --> 1415.88]  or pain
[1415.88 --> 1417.32]  for the old
[1417.32 --> 1418.28]  order of things
[1418.28 --> 1420.20]  has passed away
[1420.20 --> 1422.54]  as God's people
[1422.54 --> 1423.58]  in the days of Joseph
[1423.58 --> 1425.74]  so now it's true
[1425.74 --> 1426.50]  we still live
[1426.50 --> 1427.36]  in the midst of death
[1427.36 --> 1429.38]  those who put
[1429.38 --> 1429.86]  their hope
[1429.86 --> 1430.44]  in God
[1430.44 --> 1431.58]  and his promise
[1431.58 --> 1432.50]  that today
[1432.50 --> 1434.12]  still die
[1434.12 --> 1435.92]  are placed
[1435.92 --> 1436.98]  in coffins
[1436.98 --> 1438.42]  and carried
[1438.42 --> 1439.14]  to their graves
[1439.14 --> 1441.78]  you and I too
[1441.78 --> 1442.52]  are not home yet
[1442.52 --> 1444.42]  as believers
[1444.42 --> 1444.88]  we live
[1444.88 --> 1446.50]  in an in-between time
[1446.50 --> 1448.94]  between the already
[1448.94 --> 1449.70]  of the kingdom
[1449.70 --> 1450.40]  of God
[1450.40 --> 1451.08]  that invaded
[1451.08 --> 1451.72]  our world
[1451.72 --> 1452.32]  and the person
[1452.32 --> 1453.22]  of Jesus Christ
[1453.22 --> 1454.66]  and that has been
[1454.66 --> 1455.68]  born in our hearts
[1455.68 --> 1456.40]  through God's word
[1456.40 --> 1457.14]  and God's spirit
[1457.14 --> 1459.44]  and the not yet
[1459.44 --> 1460.22]  of the fully
[1460.22 --> 1461.30]  realized kingdom
[1461.30 --> 1461.84]  of God
[1461.84 --> 1462.82]  that will come
[1462.82 --> 1463.54]  with Jesus
[1463.54 --> 1464.52]  returning glory
[1464.52 --> 1466.12]  when God
[1466.12 --> 1466.88]  will be all
[1466.88 --> 1467.26]  in all
[1467.26 --> 1467.78]  everything
[1467.78 --> 1469.68]  to everyone
[1469.68 --> 1472.36]  but as God
[1472.36 --> 1473.40]  spoke in the beginning
[1473.40 --> 1475.00]  and there was light
[1475.00 --> 1476.48]  and there was life
[1476.48 --> 1479.06]  so an empty grave
[1479.06 --> 1480.14]  declares to us
[1480.14 --> 1481.02]  that in the end
[1481.02 --> 1482.02]  God will speak
[1482.02 --> 1482.74]  light
[1482.74 --> 1483.66]  and life
[1483.66 --> 1484.70]  once again
[1484.70 --> 1485.72]  and make
[1485.72 --> 1486.88]  everything
[1486.88 --> 1487.84]  new
[1487.84 --> 1490.94]  we await
[1490.94 --> 1491.58]  that voice
[1491.58 --> 1493.44]  even as we hear
[1493.44 --> 1494.56]  whispers of it already
[1494.56 --> 1495.90]  now
[1495.90 --> 1496.64]  through the spirit
[1496.64 --> 1497.16]  of God
[1497.16 --> 1498.88]  both in his word
[1498.88 --> 1500.48]  and at this table
[1500.48 --> 1501.16]  stands here
[1501.16 --> 1502.30]  before me
[1502.30 --> 1503.10]  where we had hope
[1503.10 --> 1504.04]  to celebrate communion
[1504.04 --> 1505.10]  again this morning
[1505.10 --> 1507.30]  this table
[1507.30 --> 1508.30]  also
[1508.30 --> 1509.46]  a reminder
[1509.46 --> 1510.94]  that the Lord
[1510.94 --> 1511.88]  gave us
[1511.88 --> 1512.42]  to revive
[1512.42 --> 1513.24]  our hope
[1513.24 --> 1513.92]  on a journey
[1513.92 --> 1515.56]  to the promised land
[1515.56 --> 1517.74]  when your children
[1517.74 --> 1518.14]  ask you
[1518.14 --> 1519.50]  what's with this table
[1519.50 --> 1521.52]  what's that about
[1521.52 --> 1522.42]  this bread
[1522.42 --> 1523.00]  this wine
[1523.00 --> 1524.02]  right
[1524.02 --> 1524.72]  you tell them
[1524.72 --> 1525.44]  this table
[1525.44 --> 1526.26]  means that God
[1526.26 --> 1527.52]  came to our aid
[1527.52 --> 1528.40]  in Jesus
[1528.40 --> 1529.82]  and that because
[1529.82 --> 1530.72]  Jesus died
[1530.72 --> 1531.56]  and rose again
[1531.56 --> 1532.90]  he will come for us
[1532.90 --> 1533.28]  again
[1533.28 --> 1534.42]  one day soon
[1534.42 --> 1536.02]  God will deliver us
[1536.02 --> 1536.84]  from our bondage
[1536.84 --> 1537.36]  to death
[1537.36 --> 1537.98]  and decay
[1537.98 --> 1538.64]  and the devil
[1538.64 --> 1539.54]  and bring us
[1539.54 --> 1540.44]  to a new land
[1540.44 --> 1541.66]  this table
[1541.66 --> 1542.60]  placed in front
[1542.60 --> 1543.58]  of our sanctuary
[1543.58 --> 1544.94]  means rescue
[1544.94 --> 1546.06]  means salvation
[1546.06 --> 1547.48]  it proclaims
[1547.48 --> 1547.92]  the death
[1547.92 --> 1548.74]  and resurrection
[1548.74 --> 1550.92]  until he comes
[1550.92 --> 1551.72]  again
[1551.72 --> 1554.98]  and then you tell them
[1554.98 --> 1557.66]  and you tell yourself
[1557.66 --> 1558.82]  every Sunday again
[1558.82 --> 1561.02]  if we are on God's side
[1561.02 --> 1563.34]  we are on
[1563.34 --> 1564.66]  the winning side
[1564.66 --> 1566.98]  life is going to win
[1566.98 --> 1568.04]  over death
[1568.04 --> 1569.66]  love is over hate
[1569.66 --> 1571.38]  peace is going to win
[1571.38 --> 1572.40]  over violence
[1572.40 --> 1573.06]  righteousness
[1573.06 --> 1574.34]  is going to win
[1574.34 --> 1575.22]  over injustice
[1575.22 --> 1577.26]  good is going to win
[1577.26 --> 1578.20]  over evil
[1578.20 --> 1579.38]  so don't ever
[1579.38 --> 1581.38]  ever give up hope
[1581.38 --> 1583.54]  not for people
[1583.54 --> 1584.08]  you love
[1584.08 --> 1585.78]  not for yourself
[1585.78 --> 1587.56]  not for the church
[1587.56 --> 1589.68]  not for the world
[1589.68 --> 1592.02]  not for God
[1592.02 --> 1593.96]  this is
[1593.96 --> 1595.62]  our Father's world
[1595.62 --> 1597.14]  oh let us
[1597.14 --> 1597.88]  not forget
[1597.88 --> 1598.94]  that though the wrong
[1598.94 --> 1600.04]  is great and strong
[1600.04 --> 1600.60]  God
[1600.60 --> 1602.22]  is the ruler
[1602.22 --> 1603.28]  yet
[1603.28 --> 1606.30]  especially
[1606.30 --> 1607.04]  especially as we are
[1607.04 --> 1607.90]  about to begin
[1607.90 --> 1609.62]  the season of Advent
[1609.62 --> 1612.18]  leading up to the good news
[1612.18 --> 1612.94]  of Emmanuel
[1612.94 --> 1614.72]  God with us
[1614.72 --> 1616.18]  in Jesus
[1616.18 --> 1616.74]  his son
[1616.74 --> 1618.96]  may that hope
[1618.96 --> 1620.02]  give each of you
[1620.02 --> 1621.30]  and us together
[1621.30 --> 1622.38]  renewed
[1622.38 --> 1624.08]  spiritual energy
[1624.08 --> 1625.12]  even in this
[1625.12 --> 1626.12]  difficult time
[1626.12 --> 1627.44]  of COVID-19
[1627.44 --> 1629.76]  the spiritual energy
[1629.76 --> 1630.38]  we need
[1630.38 --> 1631.52]  to dream
[1631.52 --> 1632.44]  God's dreams
[1632.44 --> 1633.94]  to strive
[1633.94 --> 1634.54]  for the good
[1634.54 --> 1635.34]  God's word
[1635.34 --> 1636.00]  commands
[1636.00 --> 1637.02]  and promises
[1637.02 --> 1638.90]  and to work
[1638.90 --> 1639.84]  for God's
[1639.84 --> 1640.84]  promised future
[1640.84 --> 1641.60]  by shaping
[1641.60 --> 1642.90]  our lives
[1642.90 --> 1643.56]  that's come
[1643.56 --> 1644.80]  coming
[1644.80 --> 1646.26]  for to carry
[1646.26 --> 1647.54]  us home
[1647.54 --> 1649.60]  in the name
[1649.60 --> 1650.18]  of the Father
[1650.18 --> 1650.90]  the Son
[1650.90 --> 1652.48]  and the Holy Spirit
[1652.48 --> 1654.12]  let's pray
[1654.12 --> 1656.80]  gracious God
[1656.80 --> 1657.56]  we thank you
[1657.56 --> 1660.00]  for the hope
[1660.00 --> 1660.80]  that is ours
[1660.80 --> 1662.62]  in Christ Jesus
[1662.62 --> 1664.88]  for the hope
[1664.88 --> 1665.76]  that we will celebrate
[1665.76 --> 1666.92]  again and anew
[1666.92 --> 1668.16]  in the season of Advent
[1668.16 --> 1669.34]  beginning next week
[1669.34 --> 1671.24]  leading up to the
[1671.24 --> 1671.80]  celebration
[1671.80 --> 1673.64]  of the day
[1673.64 --> 1674.58]  that we have marked
[1674.58 --> 1676.98]  to celebrate
[1676.98 --> 1678.90]  the incarnation
[1678.90 --> 1680.22]  God
[1680.22 --> 1680.88]  you
[1680.88 --> 1681.48]  coming
[1681.48 --> 1682.66]  in our flesh
[1682.66 --> 1683.98]  in Jesus
[1683.98 --> 1684.62]  your son
[1684.62 --> 1686.68]  to remind us
[1686.68 --> 1688.60]  that our hope
[1688.60 --> 1689.42]  is real
[1689.42 --> 1690.76]  our hope
[1690.76 --> 1691.96]  has flesh and blood
[1691.96 --> 1694.38]  and so we pray
[1694.38 --> 1696.42]  together with Joseph
[1696.42 --> 1697.92]  may our faith
[1697.92 --> 1698.28]  too
[1698.28 --> 1699.80]  remain strong
[1699.80 --> 1700.46]  may our hope
[1700.46 --> 1701.50]  remain alive
[1701.50 --> 1703.42]  and may we live lives
[1703.42 --> 1704.00]  consistent
[1704.00 --> 1705.42]  with that faith
[1705.42 --> 1706.70]  and that hope
[1706.70 --> 1707.78]  every day
[1707.78 --> 1709.50]  in Jesus name
[1709.50 --> 1709.98]  we pray
[1709.98 --> 1711.10]  amen
