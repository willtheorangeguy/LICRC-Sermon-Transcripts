[0.00 → 13.02] this morning together we're going to read from Luke 1 we're going to read verse 67 through 79
[13.02 → 20.38] I invite you to grab your bible grab a notebook whatever it is that will help you engage in this
[20.38 → 26.82] process we will have the text on the screen and i also just want to say personally i really
[26.82 → 34.12] appreciate everyone's feedback and emails and touching base with me at some point throughout
[34.12 → 42.34] the week preaching in this way to an almost empty sanctuary is difficult because you don't get that
[42.34 → 48.18] same interaction over coffee after church or whatever the case may be and so those ways that
[48.18 → 54.70] we do experience that are meaningful to me and, so thank you for that now that you found Luke 1 let's
[54.70 → 56.68] read together starting at verse 67
[56.68 → 71.54] his father Zachariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied praise be to the lord the god of
[71.54 → 79.14] Israel because he has come and has redeemed his people he has raised up a horn of salvation for
[79.14 → 86.98] us in the house of his servant David as he said through his holy prophets long ago salvation from
[86.98 → 93.22] our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us to show mercy to our fathers and to remember his holy
[93.22 → 100.32] covenant the oath he swore to our father Abraham to rescue us from the hand of our enemies and to enable
[100.32 → 108.56] us to serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness before him all our days and you
[108.56 → 115.66] my child will be called a prophet of the most high for you will go on before the lord to prepare the way
[115.66 → 122.60] for him to give his people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins because of
[122.60 → 129.76] the tender mercy of our god by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven to shine on those living
[129.76 → 138.74] in darkness and in the shadow of death to guide our feet into the path of peace this is the word of the lord
[138.74 → 151.88] as many of you listening will know my family recently travelled across the country in our move here we had an 11
[151.88 → 160.56] day long trip from Ontario to here in Langley and on the last day of that trip we had just from
[160.56 → 171.12] colonia to Langley left that's 350 kilometres that's all that was left of our 11-day journey we were so
[171.12 → 178.96] excited to get here and so excited to get going in the morning that we packed everything up and we
[178.96 → 186.72] were on the road and ready to go because we were coming to our new city our new home
[186.72 → 194.90] but if you know that trip you know that we also had one obstacle left right you probably know it
[194.90 → 203.40] the coquihalla highway the highway through hell as the Discovery Channel show calls it and the further
[203.40 → 210.92] up the pass we got the worst the weather became this is mid-November now and by the time we reached
[210.92 → 216.70] the summit we were no longer actually driving on roads but driving on compacted ice and snow
[216.70 → 223.80] with the car rumbling all around the last five kilometres to the summit in fact we got stuck
[223.80 → 231.50] behind two snow plows one in each lane and so all of that excitement all of that hurry all of that
[231.50 → 238.32] anticipation and all of that energy to get going and to get to where we were going stopped well maybe
[238.32 → 244.76] not stopped but crawling at five kilometres per hour behind two big machines that you can't see around
[244.76 → 247.62] and to make matters worse I was the first car behind them
[247.62 → 255.10] we wanted to get here so badly we had so much energy and excitement for that trip
[255.10 → 259.40] but there we are stuck behind two snow plows
[259.40 → 267.12] another example even more recently than that the other day we were trying to get out of our house
[267.12 → 274.02] in the morning to get the kids off to school now that morning in particular we really struggled to get out the door
[274.02 → 281.12] at first right the agenda wasn't in the school bag, and we couldn't find it
[281.12 → 288.92] second the boots or the right boots weren't at the door, and we couldn't find them in the chaos of a newly moved house
[288.92 → 295.82] and third I forgot to pack the all-important water bottle in one of my kids bags, and we couldn't find that
[295.82 → 301.16] needless to say by the time we actually got everything ready we were rushing out the door
[301.16 → 307.46] we quickly threw everything in the back of my little car started it up backed out of the driveway threw it into first gear
[307.46 → 308.68] whipped around the corner went
[308.68 → 313.72] stopped there's a garbage truck
[313.72 → 320.78] now I don't know about garbage collection on your streets and I don't know if this is just a Langley thing or what I'm just learning
[320.78 → 328.46] but the garbage collection on our street has this special way of driving down the road going from side to side to side
[328.46 → 333.08] lollygagging their way to the journey one side of the street to the other so when we were in that hurry
[333.08 → 334.42] there I am stopped
[334.42 → 336.34] watching the garbage truck
[336.34 → 338.12] do its little dance
[338.12 → 340.48] and I couldn't go anywhere
[340.48 → 343.86] stuck behind a big green
[343.86 → 345.36] garbage truck
[345.36 → 348.30] now I shared these two stories
[348.30 → 352.58] because I think they can actually function for us kind of as parables
[352.58 → 354.08] for right now
[354.08 → 360.76] right not just in covid times right where yes in these days we want to hurry up, and we want to get through it
[360.76 → 362.24] right we're tired of waiting
[362.24 → 367.36] we've got the good news of vaccines that has just come and is starting to be distributed
[367.36 → 371.56] and now we want to get back to normal whatever that means
[371.56 → 373.74] but we can't
[373.74 → 377.06] right we're stuck behind the big green truck of procedure
[377.06 → 381.38] of dispensing of refrigeration technology requirements
[381.38 → 383.18] we're stuck behind the
[383.18 → 387.32] supply being dwarfed by the demand
[387.32 → 391.12] we're stuck behind months more of waiting
[391.12 → 396.04] but like I said not just in covid times but generally
[396.04 → 399.16] right this is the last week of advent
[399.16 → 401.62] right it's the final days before Christmas
[401.62 → 403.42] and we just want to get there
[403.42 → 405.38] right we just want to open our presents
[405.38 → 407.16] we just want to cook that turkey or
[407.16 → 409.08] small chicken maybe this year
[409.08 → 410.22] whatever it may be
[410.22 → 412.12] right we just want to get there
[412.12 → 414.12] we've waited long enough
[414.12 → 417.80] but there are two snow plows in front of us
[417.80 → 420.46] stopping us from getting where we want to go
[420.46 → 422.40] at the speed we want to get there
[422.40 → 426.76] patience for everything is running thin
[426.76 → 428.26] we've got places to be
[428.26 → 429.50] and people to see
[429.50 → 431.58] and we've had just about enough
[431.58 → 432.78] of this waiting
[432.78 → 437.94] and it's exactly into that moment
[437.94 → 439.88] that I want to speak
[439.88 → 444.88] precisely when we've run out of patience
[444.88 → 450.38] precisely when we are rushing from one thing to the next to the next to the next
[450.38 → 452.32] and then we get stopped
[452.32 → 458.30] now we read this morning Zachariah's song
[458.30 → 460.14] it's sometimes called the Benedictus
[460.14 → 463.96] but let me remind you of Zachariah's story
[463.96 → 466.98] now Zachariah is husband to Elizabeth
[466.98 → 470.72] and he is a priest serving in the temple at Jerusalem
[470.72 → 473.54] and one night while he's serving in the temple
[473.54 → 476.08] the angel Gabriel appears to him
[476.08 → 478.44] and tells him that his wife will have a baby
[478.44 → 480.84] now Zachariah is a pretty old man
[480.84 → 483.36] his wife is also no longer a young woman
[483.36 → 485.30] and so he struggles to believe that
[485.30 → 487.80] she has been barren for their entire marriage together
[487.80 → 490.94] and he doesn't believe that this is possible
[490.94 → 494.50] and so Gabriel
[494.50 → 497.86] in a real awesome sort of power move
[497.86 → 498.74] actually says
[498.74 → 500.30] I am Gabriel
[500.30 → 502.72] I stand in the presence of god
[502.72 → 505.54] I have been sent here to speak this message to you
[505.54 → 507.46] and because you didn't believe me
[507.46 → 509.62] you will not be able to speak
[509.62 → 512.04] until the child is born
[512.04 → 514.44] and Zachariah fell mute
[514.44 → 517.30] fast-forward nine months
[517.30 → 519.34] Zachariah has finished
[519.34 → 521.94] at the end of his time in the temple
[521.94 → 523.54] he goes back home to Elizabeth
[523.54 → 524.66] nine months later
[524.66 → 525.80] they have a son
[525.80 → 526.84] and he is born
[526.84 → 528.16] and on the eighth day
[528.16 → 529.20] their child
[529.20 → 530.82] is taken
[530.82 → 533.20] to be circumcised
[533.20 → 535.18] now this is normal for Jewish boys
[535.18 → 536.30] to do on the eighth day
[536.30 → 537.36] the eighth day
[537.36 → 538.26] the day of circumcision
[538.26 → 540.48] is also the official naming day
[540.48 → 542.50] and so you didn't release the name of the child
[542.50 → 543.26] out into the public
[543.26 → 544.28] until that day
[544.28 → 546.92] he was going to be named after his father
[546.92 → 548.36] or so everyone assumed
[548.36 → 549.92] but the angel Gabriel
[549.92 → 552.10] Gabriel had told Zachariah
[552.10 → 554.06] that he should be called john
[554.06 → 556.18] and so when people come and say
[556.18 → 557.74] what name will this child be given
[557.74 → 559.76] Zachariah takes his writing tablet
[559.76 → 560.36] because remember
[560.36 → 561.34] he hasn't been able to speak
[561.34 → 562.18] for these nine months
[562.18 → 563.42] and he is about to
[563.42 → 565.08] and he writes on that tablet
[565.08 → 567.36] his name is John
[567.36 → 569.02] and as soon as he does that
[569.02 → 570.66] his mouth is opened
[570.66 → 572.00] and he can speak again
[572.00 → 574.54] and he begins praising god
[574.54 → 578.00] what we read
[578.00 → 579.88] is his song of praise
[579.88 → 582.14] now look at it with me
[582.14 → 583.04] have it in front of you
[583.04 → 583.74] hopefully right
[583.74 → 585.34] the first part of that song
[585.34 → 586.92] verse 68 through 75
[586.92 → 588.16] is about
[588.16 → 589.96] what who Zachariah calls
[589.96 → 592.28] the lord coming to redeem his people
[592.28 → 593.14] right
[593.14 → 594.78] this part is about a son
[594.78 → 595.96] who would be in the house
[595.96 → 597.18] and line of David
[597.18 → 598.48] who Zachariah calls
[598.48 → 599.82] a horn of salvation
[599.82 → 600.80] right
[600.80 → 602.74] he will bring salvation from enemies
[602.74 → 604.22] and bring mercy to fathers
[604.22 → 606.06] by remembering his covenant
[606.06 → 607.28] his promise
[607.28 → 607.80] right
[607.80 → 608.62] this son
[608.62 → 609.90] king and lord
[609.90 → 612.16] will make people able to serve
[612.16 → 613.82] god without fear
[613.82 → 614.58] in holiness
[614.58 → 615.60] and in righteousness
[615.60 → 618.84] now Zachariah may not have known it
[618.84 → 620.08] but the Holy Spirit
[620.08 → 621.34] who gave him this song
[621.34 → 622.14] sure did
[622.14 → 622.86] and we do
[622.86 → 624.44] standing on this side of history
[624.44 → 625.44] this side of Jesus
[625.44 → 627.64] we know that he is talking about
[627.64 → 628.48] Jesus
[628.48 → 630.20] the son to be born to Mary
[630.20 → 630.76] in fact
[630.76 → 632.28] Elizabeth's relative
[632.28 → 633.26] of some sort
[633.26 → 633.80] right
[633.80 → 634.94] Zachariah's boy
[634.94 → 635.56] john
[635.56 → 636.60] and that boy
[636.60 → 637.16] Jesus
[637.16 → 638.60] will be related
[638.60 → 639.38] and Jesus
[639.38 → 640.28] we know
[640.28 → 641.22] is the god
[641.22 → 642.78] man promised of ages
[642.78 → 644.10] who will take away
[644.10 → 645.22] the sin of the world
[645.22 → 648.08] and in the next part of the song
[648.08 → 648.60] you see it
[648.60 → 650.16] beginning in verse 76
[650.16 → 651.78] Zachariah turns
[651.78 → 652.84] his focus
[652.84 → 654.18] to his son
[654.18 → 656.70] and the prophecy says
[656.70 → 657.22] and you
[657.22 → 658.02] my child
[658.02 → 658.72] will be called
[658.72 → 659.26] a prophet
[659.26 → 660.48] prophet of the most high
[660.48 → 661.20] for you
[661.20 → 662.58] will go before the lord
[662.58 → 664.06] to prepare the way for him
[664.06 → 665.90] and here's the focus
[665.90 → 666.92] that I want us to
[666.92 → 668.32] zero in on
[668.32 → 669.08] this morning
[669.08 → 670.10] right
[670.10 → 671.08] look at verse 76
[671.08 → 672.80] and track through
[672.80 → 674.18] how Zachariah
[674.18 → 674.90] builds
[674.90 → 675.18] right
[675.18 → 676.52] john will grow up
[676.52 → 677.80] to be a prophet
[677.80 → 679.30] preparing the way
[679.30 → 680.00] for Jesus
[680.00 → 681.34] by teaching salvation
[681.34 → 682.70] through the forgiveness
[682.70 → 683.40] of sins
[683.40 → 685.02] because of the
[685.02 → 686.04] tender
[686.04 → 687.96] mercy of god
[687.96 → 689.94] and then notice
[689.94 → 690.94] the tender
[690.94 → 691.86] mercy of god
[691.86 → 692.30] at the beginning
[692.30 → 693.22] of verse 78
[693.22 → 694.78] is connected
[694.78 → 696.38] by a straight line
[696.38 → 697.70] to those living
[697.70 → 698.32] in darkness
[698.32 → 699.24] to those living
[699.24 → 699.84] in the shadow
[699.84 → 700.32] of death
[700.32 → 702.00] to guide our feet
[702.00 → 702.88] and here it is
[702.88 → 705.14] into the path
[705.14 → 706.48] of peace
[706.48 → 708.36] right the mercy
[708.36 → 709.00] of god
[709.00 → 711.08] has a straight line
[711.08 → 712.86] to peace
[712.86 → 714.58] in your life
[714.58 → 717.18] when you've experienced
[717.18 → 717.90] the mercy
[717.90 → 719.06] of god
[719.06 → 721.58] it's made manifest
[721.58 → 723.26] in peace
[723.26 → 725.70] when you know
[725.70 → 726.48] mercy
[726.48 → 729.14] it's made tangible
[729.14 → 731.44] in peace
[731.44 → 733.46] when the mercy
[733.46 → 734.12] that god
[734.12 → 735.34] has the mercy
[735.34 → 735.82] of god
[735.82 → 736.92] has made its way
[736.92 → 738.28] into here
[738.28 → 739.70] that is into the throne
[739.70 → 740.46] of your heart
[740.46 → 741.82] there will be peace
[741.82 → 742.82] in here
[742.82 → 743.72] right that's in the
[743.72 → 744.68] movements of your mind
[744.68 → 746.10] and there will be peace
[746.10 → 746.92] out here
[746.92 → 747.84] in the makings
[747.84 → 748.72] of your hands
[748.72 → 750.56] right as the mercy
[750.56 → 751.46] of god
[751.46 → 752.50] makes its way
[752.50 → 753.36] to the throne
[753.36 → 754.36] of your heart
[754.36 → 755.88] there will be peace
[755.88 → 756.62] in the movements
[756.62 → 757.32] of your mind
[757.32 → 757.96] and peace
[757.96 → 759.00] in the makings
[759.00 → 760.12] of your hands
[760.12 → 763.06] and just
[763.06 → 763.90] like
[763.90 → 764.74] god's
[764.74 → 765.62] mercy
[765.62 → 766.68] and grace
[766.68 → 767.52] is a gift
[767.52 → 769.84] so is the peace
[769.84 → 770.56] that he
[770.56 → 771.50] offers
[771.50 → 773.16] think about
[773.16 → 774.20] what the angels
[774.20 → 775.34] say to the shepherds
[775.34 → 776.40] and we've been saying it
[776.40 → 777.66] every week
[777.66 → 778.20] in the month
[778.20 → 779.34] of December
[779.34 → 779.96] because it's the
[779.96 → 780.80] Emmanuel kids
[780.80 → 781.80] memory verse
[781.80 → 783.22] glory to god
[783.22 → 783.92] in the highest
[783.92 → 784.90] and on earth
[784.90 → 786.74] peace
[786.74 → 788.46] peace to those
[788.46 → 789.08] on whom
[789.08 → 790.36] his favour
[790.36 → 791.42] rests
[791.42 → 793.48] and again
[793.48 → 794.44] right
[794.44 → 794.96] when Jesus
[794.96 → 795.70] is preaching
[795.70 → 796.36] and teaching
[796.36 → 798.04] he says to his disciples
[798.04 → 799.34] in john 14
[799.34 → 799.76] he says
[799.76 → 800.34] peace
[800.34 → 800.78] i
[800.78 → 802.72] leave with you
[802.72 → 803.78] my peace
[803.78 → 804.86] I give to you
[804.86 → 805.76] I do not give
[805.76 → 806.88] as the world gives
[806.88 → 808.12] do not let your hearts
[808.12 → 808.66] be troubled
[808.66 → 810.82] and do not be afraid
[810.82 → 812.34] right
[812.34 → 812.84] Paul
[812.84 → 813.52] says
[813.52 → 814.56] the mind
[814.56 → 815.00] governed
[815.00 → 816.08] by the spirit
[816.08 → 816.96] is life
[816.96 → 817.90] and
[817.90 → 818.88] peace
[818.88 → 820.26] right
[820.26 → 821.14] or think of the fruit
[821.14 → 821.84] of the spirit
[821.84 → 822.32] right
[822.32 → 823.24] the fruit of the spirit
[823.24 → 823.60] again
[823.60 → 824.78] a new reality
[824.78 → 825.34] in you
[825.34 → 826.30] because of the gift
[826.30 → 827.46] of the Holy Spirit
[827.46 → 828.82] right the fruit of the spirit
[828.82 → 830.04] in Galatians 5 22
[830.04 → 831.54] but the fruit of the spirit
[831.54 → 832.90] is love
[832.90 → 834.04] joy
[834.04 → 835.94] peace
[835.94 → 839.26] Jesus has come
[839.26 → 841.36] and there is a straight line
[841.36 → 842.78] from the mercy of god
[842.78 → 845.00] given to the peace of god
[845.00 → 846.06] experienced
[846.06 → 847.38] in your life
[847.38 → 850.16] and let me be really
[850.16 → 851.04] clear
[851.04 → 853.22] the peace
[853.22 → 854.14] that Jesus
[854.14 → 854.78] brings
[854.78 → 856.16] is so much
[856.16 → 856.88] more
[856.88 → 857.30] than
[857.30 → 858.60] not war
[858.60 → 859.58] right
[859.58 → 860.98] it's even more
[860.98 → 861.92] than a sense of
[861.92 → 862.50] calm
[862.50 → 863.76] in chaos
[863.76 → 864.54] the peace
[864.54 → 865.46] that Jesus
[865.46 → 865.82] brings
[865.82 → 867.02] is even more
[867.02 → 867.84] than the forgiveness
[867.84 → 868.60] of sins
[868.60 → 869.62] now it is that
[869.62 → 870.18] of course
[870.18 → 871.36] but it's also more
[871.36 → 872.30] the peace
[872.30 → 873.26] of Jesus
[873.26 → 875.08] is whole life
[875.08 → 875.76] restoration
[875.76 → 877.30] to the design
[877.30 → 878.36] and intent
[878.36 → 879.42] of god
[879.42 → 880.26] for you
[880.26 → 882.68] the peace
[882.68 → 883.18] of Jesus
[883.18 → 884.22] is whole life
[884.22 → 884.66] restoration
[884.66 → 885.74] to the design
[885.74 → 886.62] and intent
[886.62 → 887.40] of god
[887.40 → 888.60] for you
[888.60 → 890.42] and for your life
[890.42 → 892.00] for your neighbourhood
[892.00 → 893.70] and community
[893.70 → 895.42] now the word
[895.42 → 895.98] peace
[895.98 → 897.58] in the bible
[897.58 → 898.96] is really built
[898.96 → 900.14] on the Hebrew
[900.14 → 900.64] concept
[900.64 → 901.44] of the word
[901.44 → 902.02] shalom
[902.02 → 903.64] now maybe you've heard
[903.64 → 904.38] that word before
[904.38 → 905.18] and today
[905.18 → 906.36] in modern day
[906.36 → 907.22] Israel
[907.22 → 909.04] the word shalom
[909.04 → 909.76] is used
[909.76 → 910.44] as a greeting
[910.44 → 910.96] right
[910.96 → 912.00] people will walk around
[912.00 → 912.46] and they'll see
[912.46 → 912.90] their neighbour
[912.90 → 913.94] or someone in the streets
[913.94 → 914.58] and they will say
[914.58 → 915.12] shalom
[915.12 → 916.22] Baker to
[916.22 → 917.30] which just means
[917.30 → 917.84] peace
[917.84 → 918.84] good morning
[918.84 → 921.42] in the bible
[921.42 → 921.84] though
[921.84 → 922.72] shalom
[922.72 → 923.78] is so
[923.78 → 924.68] much
[924.68 → 925.44] more
[925.44 → 926.56] right
[926.56 → 927.08] shalom
[927.08 → 927.36] is
[927.36 → 928.46] wholeness
[928.46 → 929.12] restored
[929.12 → 930.98] in fact
[930.98 → 931.62] I really love
[931.62 → 931.98] the way
[931.98 → 932.28] that
[932.28 → 932.98] Cornelius
[932.98 → 933.58] planting
[933.58 → 934.08] Jr
[934.08 → 935.02] puts it
[935.02 → 936.40] he says
[936.40 → 937.84] in the bible
[937.84 → 938.88] shalom
[938.88 → 939.66] means
[939.66 → 940.56] universal
[940.56 → 941.44] flourishing
[941.44 → 942.40] wholeness
[942.40 → 943.16] and delight
[943.16 → 944.00] a rich
[944.00 → 944.98] state of affairs
[944.98 → 945.52] in which
[945.52 → 946.78] natural needs
[946.78 → 947.52] are satisfied
[947.52 → 948.42] and natural
[948.42 → 948.88] gifts
[948.88 → 949.70] fruitfully
[949.70 → 950.38] employed
[950.38 → 951.18] a state
[951.18 → 951.70] of affairs
[951.70 → 952.42] that inspires
[952.42 → 953.52] joyful wonder
[953.52 → 954.72] as its creator
[954.72 → 955.30] and saviour
[955.30 → 956.24] opens doors
[956.24 → 956.96] and welcomes
[956.96 → 957.64] the creatures
[957.64 → 958.44] in whom
[958.44 → 959.24] he delights
[959.24 → 960.62] shalom
[960.62 → 962.20] in other words
[962.20 → 963.26] is the way
[963.26 → 964.18] things ought
[964.18 → 964.80] to be
[964.80 → 967.28] the peace
[967.28 → 968.18] of advent
[968.18 → 969.86] the peace
[969.86 → 971.12] of Christmas
[971.12 → 972.04] the peace
[972.04 → 972.64] that we are
[972.64 → 973.40] all longing
[973.40 → 973.78] for
[973.78 → 974.80] is being
[974.80 → 975.60] restored
[975.60 → 976.44] to god's
[976.44 → 976.98] intention
[976.98 → 978.08] and god's
[978.08 → 978.56] design
[978.56 → 980.16] the things
[980.16 → 981.14] that are wrong
[981.14 → 981.94] in the world
[981.94 → 982.86] or when things
[982.86 → 983.44] go wrong
[983.44 → 984.32] in your life
[984.32 → 985.24] are really
[985.24 → 986.04] the consequence
[986.04 → 986.88] of shalom
[986.88 → 987.60] breaking
[987.60 → 989.98] the gospel
[989.98 → 991.46] of Jesus
[991.46 → 992.46] living the life
[992.46 → 993.48] I should have lived
[993.48 → 994.48] and dying
[994.48 → 995.06] the death
[995.06 → 995.88] that I deserved
[995.88 → 997.02] that gospel
[997.02 → 997.82] means
[997.82 → 999.20] is the means
[999.20 → 999.78] by which
[999.78 → 1000.92] I am restored
[1000.92 → 1001.74] right
[1001.74 → 1002.34] not just to
[1002.34 → 1002.88] relationship
[1002.88 → 1003.46] with god
[1003.46 → 1004.44] my heavenly father
[1004.44 → 1005.54] but the means
[1005.54 → 1006.50] by which I am
[1006.50 → 1006.96] restored
[1006.96 → 1007.76] to everything
[1007.76 → 1008.56] that god had
[1008.56 → 1009.02] in mind
[1009.02 → 1009.68] for humanity
[1009.68 → 1010.94] when he said
[1010.94 → 1012.00] let us make
[1012.00 → 1012.56] humanity
[1012.56 → 1014.04] in our
[1014.04 → 1014.78] image
[1014.78 → 1017.54] and look
[1017.54 → 1018.80] it's not easy
[1018.80 → 1019.88] right
[1019.88 → 1021.44] sin still has
[1021.44 → 1022.24] a hold
[1022.24 → 1023.00] on parts
[1023.00 → 1023.48] of me
[1023.48 → 1024.74] right
[1024.74 → 1025.46] and just because
[1025.46 → 1026.10] I believe
[1026.10 → 1026.80] this doctrine
[1026.80 → 1027.56] to be true
[1027.56 → 1028.46] doesn't mean
[1028.46 → 1029.14] that my life
[1029.14 → 1029.70] is totally
[1029.70 → 1030.32] transformed
[1030.32 → 1030.72] and that I'm
[1030.72 → 1031.40] a picture
[1031.40 → 1032.20] perfect saint
[1032.20 → 1032.82] of peace
[1032.82 → 1033.34] and calm
[1033.34 → 1034.06] and restoration
[1034.06 → 1035.54] just ask my kids
[1035.54 → 1036.26] they will tell you
[1036.26 → 1036.92] that's not true
[1036.92 → 1039.08] but it
[1039.08 → 1040.42] does mean
[1040.42 → 1042.02] I am being
[1042.02 → 1042.90] transformed
[1042.90 → 1044.14] it does mean
[1044.14 → 1044.74] I am in the
[1044.74 → 1045.30] midst of
[1045.30 → 1046.20] restoration
[1046.20 → 1046.66] right
[1046.66 → 1047.16] I have
[1047.16 → 1047.80] the peace
[1047.80 → 1048.40] that Jesus
[1048.40 → 1048.88] offers
[1048.88 → 1049.84] because I have
[1049.84 → 1050.44] by grace
[1050.44 → 1051.00] through faith
[1051.00 → 1052.10] being the object
[1052.10 → 1052.98] of god's
[1052.98 → 1053.50] mercy
[1053.50 → 1054.48] and the line
[1054.48 → 1055.12] from god's
[1055.12 → 1055.46] mercy
[1055.46 → 1056.40] goes straight
[1056.40 → 1057.12] through
[1057.12 → 1057.94] right through
[1057.94 → 1058.48] me
[1058.48 → 1059.62] and to me
[1059.62 → 1060.60] and everything
[1060.60 → 1061.20] I do
[1061.20 → 1062.06] right
[1062.06 → 1062.78] in theological
[1062.78 → 1063.54] terms
[1063.54 → 1064.64] I am justified
[1064.64 → 1065.48] by the gospel
[1065.48 → 1066.26] and I am being
[1066.26 → 1067.20] sanctified
[1067.20 → 1068.42] by the gospel
[1068.42 → 1070.24] and my mission
[1070.24 → 1070.60] now
[1070.60 → 1071.38] our mission
[1071.38 → 1071.74] now
[1071.74 → 1072.54] as Christians
[1072.54 → 1073.24] in the world
[1073.24 → 1074.10] with this message
[1074.10 → 1074.54] of peace
[1074.54 → 1075.60] is to live
[1075.60 → 1076.72] in its
[1076.72 → 1077.46] truth
[1077.46 → 1080.20] and in fact
[1080.20 → 1081.92] there's a
[1081.92 → 1083.68] generation of Christians
[1083.68 → 1084.16] really
[1084.16 → 1085.06] who are leading
[1085.06 → 1085.94] the way in this
[1085.94 → 1087.98] a few years ago
[1087.98 → 1089.62] Bethany Hong
[1089.62 → 1090.38] wrote an article
[1090.38 → 1091.26] for a leadership
[1091.26 → 1091.72] journal
[1091.72 → 1092.96] under the umbrella
[1092.96 → 1094.10] of Christianity today
[1094.10 → 1095.32] and in that article
[1095.32 → 1096.00] she writes
[1096.00 → 1098.62] the rising concern
[1098.62 → 1099.60] for justice
[1099.60 → 1100.38] is seen
[1100.38 → 1101.60] most dramatically
[1101.60 → 1103.02] among the younger
[1103.02 → 1103.68] generation
[1103.68 → 1104.92] in the church
[1104.92 → 1107.00] Christians in college
[1107.00 → 1108.08] in high school
[1108.08 → 1109.32] and even middle school
[1109.32 → 1110.22] and elementary school
[1110.22 → 1110.92] are putting
[1110.92 → 1112.48] extraordinary emphasis
[1112.48 → 1113.30] on justice
[1113.30 → 1114.38] as part of their
[1114.38 → 1115.10] Christian witness
[1115.10 → 1116.70] and established churches
[1116.70 → 1117.42] and ministries
[1117.42 → 1118.48] are taking notice
[1118.48 → 1120.76] scores of church
[1120.76 → 1121.56] youth ministries
[1121.56 → 1122.54] are now leading
[1122.54 → 1123.04] the way
[1123.04 → 1123.90] in mobilizing
[1123.90 → 1124.36] students
[1124.36 → 1124.86] not only
[1124.86 → 1125.46] to proclaim
[1125.46 → 1126.06] the gospel
[1126.06 → 1127.06] but to work
[1127.06 → 1128.12] for justice
[1128.12 → 1129.38] in the world
[1129.38 → 1131.46] in the world
[1131.46 → 1132.76] we have
[1132.76 → 1133.62] Malala
[1133.62 → 1134.32] and we have
[1134.32 → 1134.68] Greta
[1134.68 → 1135.68] leading different
[1135.68 → 1136.10] charges
[1136.10 → 1136.68] and different
[1136.68 → 1137.16] changes
[1137.16 → 1138.28] but who will
[1138.28 → 1139.02] the church's
[1139.02 → 1140.20] version of that
[1140.20 → 1140.44] be
[1140.44 → 1141.72] who will our
[1141.72 → 1142.48] church's version
[1142.48 → 1143.74] of that be
[1143.74 → 1145.56] maybe it's you
[1145.56 → 1148.00] out of the peace
[1148.00 → 1149.42] Jesus provides
[1149.42 → 1150.80] how will you
[1150.80 → 1151.72] fight
[1151.72 → 1152.88] for shalom
[1152.88 → 1156.98] and finally
[1156.98 → 1158.82] and I'll end
[1158.82 → 1159.28] it here
[1159.28 → 1160.54] this morning
[1160.54 → 1161.90] as we have
[1161.90 → 1162.38] drawn
[1162.38 → 1163.68] the line
[1163.68 → 1164.60] from god's
[1164.60 → 1164.98] mercy
[1164.98 → 1166.16] to experiencing
[1166.16 → 1166.92] peace
[1166.92 → 1167.80] and shalom
[1167.80 → 1168.48] in life
[1168.48 → 1169.76] I want to go
[1169.76 → 1170.28] back to the
[1170.28 → 1171.24] illustrations that i
[1171.24 → 1171.86] opened with
[1171.86 → 1172.96] that I said are
[1172.96 → 1173.62] sort of parable
[1173.62 → 1174.46] for our experience
[1174.46 → 1174.92] right now
[1174.92 → 1176.74] first
[1176.74 → 1177.94] knowing this
[1177.94 → 1178.54] peace
[1178.54 → 1179.32] that comes
[1179.32 → 1179.98] from god's
[1179.98 → 1180.50] mercy
[1180.50 → 1181.72] maybe we
[1181.72 → 1182.36] don't have
[1182.36 → 1183.12] to rush
[1183.12 → 1185.00] maybe we
[1185.00 → 1185.22] don't have
[1185.22 → 1185.58] to rush
[1185.58 → 1185.96] through
[1185.96 → 1186.94] the waiting
[1186.94 → 1187.72] maybe the
[1187.72 → 1188.62] peace of god
[1188.62 → 1189.00] given
[1189.00 → 1190.24] in mercy
[1190.24 → 1191.00] is enough
[1191.00 → 1191.90] to sustain
[1191.90 → 1192.34] us
[1192.34 → 1193.46] in that
[1193.46 → 1193.76] waiting
[1193.76 → 1195.42] second
[1195.42 → 1197.10] maybe
[1197.10 → 1198.56] the waiting
[1198.56 → 1200.46] is actually
[1200.46 → 1201.36] sustaining you
[1201.36 → 1203.00] or maybe it's
[1203.00 → 1204.22] preparing you
[1204.22 → 1204.80] for something
[1204.80 → 1206.50] right I was
[1206.50 → 1207.60] frustrated when i
[1207.60 → 1208.36] got stopped
[1208.36 → 1209.24] behind those
[1209.24 → 1210.16] two snowplows
[1210.16 → 1211.02] crawling along
[1211.02 → 1211.82] right I had
[1211.82 → 1212.80] places to be
[1212.80 → 1214.18] and places i
[1214.18 → 1214.88] wanted to go
[1214.88 → 1215.66] and get to
[1215.66 → 1216.36] and they were
[1216.36 → 1216.94] slowing me
[1216.94 → 1217.28] down
[1217.28 → 1218.84] but maybe
[1218.84 → 1221.52] maybe
[1221.52 → 1222.52] without them
[1222.52 → 1224.28] I would have
[1224.28 → 1224.78] learned the real
[1224.78 → 1225.46] reason why they
[1225.46 → 1225.96] call it the
[1225.96 → 1226.62] highway from hell
[1226.62 → 1228.30] now I don't know
[1228.30 → 1228.82] for sure
[1228.82 → 1230.56] but maybe
[1230.56 → 1233.10] the moderate
[1233.10 → 1234.38] inconvenience
[1234.38 → 1235.40] that god
[1235.40 → 1236.40] god has
[1236.40 → 1236.88] brought
[1236.88 → 1238.32] may be used
[1238.32 → 1239.00] by god
[1239.00 → 1240.10] to protect us
[1240.10 → 1240.70] from something
[1240.70 → 1241.02] more
[1241.02 → 1243.48] and yet
[1243.48 → 1245.30] here's where it
[1245.30 → 1245.94] gets really hard
[1245.94 → 1248.90] this will also
[1248.90 → 1249.46] be true
[1249.46 → 1251.12] of the more
[1251.12 → 1251.66] than moderate
[1251.66 → 1252.62] inconveniences
[1252.62 → 1255.06] right if god
[1255.06 → 1255.66] is sovereign
[1255.66 → 1256.36] over all
[1256.36 → 1256.92] creation
[1256.92 → 1258.38] it must be
[1258.38 → 1258.98] true in
[1258.98 → 1260.14] every circumstance
[1260.14 → 1261.52] right for
[1261.52 → 1262.62] any suffering
[1262.62 → 1263.50] or trial
[1263.50 → 1264.30] or tribulation
[1264.30 → 1265.44] in this life
[1265.44 → 1266.38] to have any
[1266.38 → 1267.48] meaning god
[1267.48 → 1268.24] must have a
[1268.24 → 1268.96] purpose for it
[1268.96 → 1269.80] and a plan
[1269.80 → 1270.60] that connects
[1270.60 → 1271.50] to his mercy
[1271.50 → 1272.52] he must
[1272.52 → 1275.36] and we believe
[1275.36 → 1275.92] he does
[1275.92 → 1279.56] there's an
[1279.56 → 1280.62] autobiographical
[1280.62 → 1281.92] book by a man
[1281.92 → 1282.68] named Sheldon
[1282.68 → 1283.24] van alien
[1283.24 → 1283.96] he was a friend
[1283.96 → 1284.50] of c.s.
[1284.58 → 1284.84] lewis
[1284.84 → 1285.96] and he wrote
[1285.96 → 1286.96] a man
[1286.96 → 1287.20] after his
[1287.20 → 1288.54] wife passed
[1288.54 → 1288.80] away
[1288.80 → 1290.38] and that book
[1290.38 → 1291.06] was called
[1291.06 → 1292.98] severe mercies
[1292.98 → 1294.86] severe mercies
[1294.86 → 1295.72] has become a
[1295.72 → 1296.56] sort of theological
[1296.56 → 1297.72] term for what
[1297.72 → 1298.16] we're talking
[1298.16 → 1298.50] about
[1298.50 → 1299.48] this sort of
[1299.48 → 1300.78] extreme and
[1300.78 → 1301.56] tragic events
[1301.56 → 1302.54] that god uses
[1302.54 → 1303.98] to reveal his
[1303.98 → 1305.00] mercy and peace
[1305.00 → 1305.86] to us
[1305.86 → 1306.68] right we call
[1306.68 → 1307.34] these gods
[1307.34 → 1308.60] severe mercies
[1308.60 → 1309.74] Jonah for instance
[1309.74 → 1310.46] knew them
[1310.46 → 1311.96] right god used
[1311.96 → 1312.76] the deathly
[1312.76 → 1313.42] experience
[1313.42 → 1313.76] of being
[1313.76 → 1314.38] caught up
[1314.38 → 1315.10] in the belly
[1315.10 → 1315.64] of a great
[1315.64 → 1316.00] fish
[1316.00 → 1316.82] to correct
[1316.82 → 1317.10] him
[1317.10 → 1318.16] right
[1318.16 → 1318.94] Norman's
[1318.94 → 1319.76] leprosy
[1319.76 → 1320.68] was used
[1320.68 → 1321.14] to bring
[1321.14 → 1321.94] glory to god
[1321.94 → 1323.74] there's a podcast
[1323.74 → 1324.80] that I listened to
[1324.80 → 1325.30] that said
[1325.30 → 1326.08] quote
[1326.08 → 1327.26] in god's
[1327.26 → 1328.46] severe mercy
[1328.46 → 1329.58] he may deal
[1329.58 → 1330.00] with us
[1330.00 → 1330.48] in ways
[1330.48 → 1331.22] that bring us
[1331.22 → 1331.84] to the end
[1331.84 → 1332.66] of ourselves
[1332.66 → 1334.12] and we might
[1334.12 → 1334.56] hate him
[1334.56 → 1335.04] for it
[1335.04 → 1337.50] but the paradox
[1337.50 → 1338.20] of god's
[1338.20 → 1338.92] severe mercy
[1338.92 → 1339.70] is this
[1339.70 → 1340.92] it's that it
[1340.92 → 1341.40] could be the
[1341.40 → 1342.28] the best thing
[1342.28 → 1342.68] that ever
[1342.68 → 1343.46] happens to us
[1343.46 → 1344.28] because we
[1344.28 → 1345.02] discover the
[1345.02 → 1345.74] truth of how
[1345.74 → 1346.78] broken and
[1346.78 → 1347.80] selfish we are
[1347.80 → 1348.66] we discover the
[1348.66 → 1349.56] truth of how
[1349.56 → 1350.40] I've been taking
[1350.40 → 1351.24] my life for
[1351.24 → 1352.28] granted as if
[1352.28 → 1353.14] I can do just
[1353.14 → 1353.96] whatever I want
[1353.96 → 1354.70] and the only
[1354.70 → 1355.58] reason I exist
[1355.58 → 1356.28] is because
[1356.28 → 1357.12] someone else
[1357.12 → 1358.12] has made me
[1358.12 → 1360.80] here's what i
[1360.80 → 1361.02] know
[1361.02 → 1362.84] whether it's
[1362.84 → 1363.58] saving you
[1363.58 → 1364.42] or preparing
[1364.42 → 1364.88] you
[1364.88 → 1366.26] or it's
[1366.26 → 1366.80] something else
[1366.80 → 1367.32] altogether
[1367.32 → 1369.04] whatever you
[1369.04 → 1369.90] are facing
[1369.90 → 1371.28] right now
[1371.28 → 1372.62] will be used
[1372.62 → 1374.06] for your good
[1374.06 → 1375.22] and god's
[1375.22 → 1375.78] glory
[1375.78 → 1377.38] right this
[1377.38 → 1378.50] is his promise
[1378.50 → 1379.48] that our present
[1379.48 → 1380.36] sufferings are not
[1380.36 → 1381.12] worth comparing
[1381.12 → 1381.96] to the glory
[1381.96 → 1382.48] that will be
[1382.48 → 1383.32] revealed in us
[1383.32 → 1384.42] this is god's
[1384.42 → 1385.26] promise that
[1385.26 → 1386.02] that we know
[1386.02 → 1386.56] that in all
[1386.56 → 1387.46] things god works
[1387.46 → 1387.96] for the good
[1387.96 → 1388.56] of those who
[1388.56 → 1388.98] love him
[1388.98 → 1389.62] of those who
[1389.62 → 1390.18] have been called
[1390.18 → 1390.98] according to his
[1390.98 → 1391.42] purpose
[1391.42 → 1393.52] the truth is
[1393.52 → 1394.38] the trouble is
[1394.38 → 1395.60] perhaps that on
[1395.60 → 1396.32] this side of
[1396.32 → 1397.56] heaven you may
[1397.56 → 1399.04] never know that
[1399.04 → 1401.56] purpose and
[1401.56 → 1403.18] truthfully once we
[1403.18 → 1404.04] get there or once
[1404.04 → 1404.88] Jesus comes back
[1404.88 → 1406.16] here I don't think
[1406.16 → 1409.08] we'll even care but
[1409.08 → 1411.70] he has one and
[1411.70 → 1418.34] maybe peace shalom is
[1418.34 → 1421.12] at times just living
[1421.12 → 1423.68] like we know that to
[1423.68 → 1424.12] be true
[1424.12 → 1427.00] because it is
[1427.00 → 1428.78] amen
[1428.78 → 1431.56] let me pray with you
[1431.56 → 1438.56] lord Jesus grant us
[1438.56 → 1439.46] your
[1439.46 → 1441.04] peace
[1441.04 → 1443.88] reveal to us the gift
[1443.88 → 1446.18] of your mercy that
[1446.18 → 1447.34] has a straight line
[1447.34 → 1449.02] to peace here and
[1449.02 → 1450.26] now in this life
[1450.26 → 1452.22] life restored and
[1452.22 → 1453.48] being restored ever
[1453.48 → 1455.56] more to your intent
[1455.56 → 1456.62] and design
[1456.62 → 1460.28] may we be fully
[1460.28 → 1462.40] human fully alive to
[1462.40 → 1464.38] the glory of our god
[1464.38 → 1467.32] god send us out in the
[1467.32 → 1469.04] power of this truth
[1469.04 → 1470.82] today that no matter
[1470.82 → 1472.56] what we face whether
[1472.56 → 1473.18] it's a moderate
[1473.18 → 1475.66] inconvenience or it
[1475.66 → 1476.50] is an incredible
[1476.50 → 1478.86] life altering trial
[1478.86 → 1481.20] that we would do so
[1481.20 → 1483.12] with the confidence
[1483.12 → 1484.48] that you are good
[1484.48 → 1487.26] you are god and you
[1487.26 → 1487.90] have a plan
[1487.90 → 1492.04] we pray this in Jesus name
[1492.04 → 1493.64] amen
[1493.64 → 1503.52] would we pray this
[1516.36 → 1516.64] how Opel
[1516.64 → 1517.30] how Opel
[1517.30 → 1517.80] been
[1517.80 → 1518.44] when
[1518.44 → 1519.30] he
[1519.30 → 1519.56] he
[1519.56 → 1519.96] he
[1519.96 → 1520.62] he
[1520.62 → 1521.46] in
