[0.00 --> 1.92]  Good morning once again.
[4.92 --> 14.82]  Hear the word of the Lord from Matthew chapter 10, verses 2 through 4.
[16.70 --> 19.40]  These are the names of the twelve apostles.
[20.50 --> 24.80]  First, Simon, who is called Peter, and his brother Andrew.
[26.08 --> 28.76]  James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John.
[30.00 --> 31.64]  Philip and Bartholomew.
[32.56 --> 35.18]  Thomas and Matthew, the tax collector.
[36.22 --> 38.52]  James, son of Alphaeus and Thaddeus.
[39.48 --> 40.72]  Simon, the zealot.
[41.72 --> 43.64]  And Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.
[45.48 --> 47.94]  This is the word of the Lord.
[47.94 --> 62.30]  So, you can be excused if your hearts were not all aflutter this morning as I read today's passage.
[62.30 --> 73.08]  Sometimes we can be on the edge of our seat as we hear about how God has powerfully worked through his people in his word.
[73.08 --> 79.58]  And other times we might need to be prodded awake at the end of its reading.
[82.18 --> 85.46]  This is not likely the most riveting passage you've ever heard.
[85.72 --> 92.44]  And yet, if we are careful, we will see that God is powerfully at work in and through it.
[92.44 --> 99.40]  Perhaps I can reread this passage in a way that may reveal a glimpse of its richness.
[101.90 --> 103.86]  These are the names of the twelve apostles.
[103.86 --> 108.52]  First, Simon, who is called Peter, and his brother Andrew.
[109.56 --> 112.56]  James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John.
[113.66 --> 115.78]  Philip and Bartholomew.
[116.98 --> 120.36]  Thomas and Matthew, the passionate liberal.
[121.52 --> 124.90]  And James, son of Alphaeus and Thaddeus.
[125.86 --> 127.94]  Simon, the staunch conservative.
[127.94 --> 131.56]  And Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.
[134.18 --> 138.56]  Now, obviously, Matthew and Simon were not liberal nor conservative.
[139.46 --> 142.94]  But using political parties that are a little more familiar with us,
[142.96 --> 146.46]  and we understand the general disdain that they have for each other,
[147.38 --> 153.32]  gives us a bit of a glimpse into how this might have been heard in Jesus' day.
[153.32 --> 158.50]  But using liberal and conservative only gives us a glimpse.
[159.28 --> 164.96]  The issues that Matthew would have faced were far deeper than the irritations most of us feel
[164.96 --> 167.94]  towards opposite political stances.
[169.70 --> 175.34]  The television show The Chosen, a TV series about Jesus' life,
[175.98 --> 181.54]  depicts this friction well as Jesus stops by the tax collector's booth
[181.54 --> 186.00]  in the middle of a busy Capernaum street in order to call Matthew.
[187.50 --> 188.50]  Jesus says,
[189.38 --> 191.00]  Matthew, son of Alphaeus.
[192.18 --> 196.70]  And with eyes wide, Matthew squeaks out,
[197.52 --> 197.78]  Yes?
[199.06 --> 201.02]  Follow me, he says.
[202.18 --> 202.70]  Me?
[204.38 --> 206.86]  Yes, you, Jesus responds with a smile.
[208.22 --> 209.82]  But just then, Peter interrupts.
[209.82 --> 211.36]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[211.64 --> 212.62]  What are you doing?
[213.70 --> 215.44]  Do you have any idea who he is?
[215.62 --> 216.92]  Do you know what he has done?
[217.32 --> 218.22]  Do you even know him?
[220.02 --> 221.58]  Yes, Jesus responds.
[222.86 --> 225.88]  And as Matthew makes his way out of the tax collector's booth
[225.88 --> 228.52]  and past the Roman centurion who he worked with,
[230.02 --> 231.20]  Peter goes on.
[231.34 --> 231.66]  He says,
[231.86 --> 232.80]  I don't get it.
[234.44 --> 235.34]  Jesus responds,
[235.34 --> 237.82]  You didn't get it when I called you either.
[237.82 --> 240.14]  But this is different.
[240.52 --> 241.84]  I'm not a tax collector.
[242.92 --> 244.66]  And Jesus simply responds,
[245.32 --> 246.38]  Get used to different.
[248.04 --> 252.00]  I think we're all still trying to get used to different.
[254.76 --> 256.36]  Matthew was a tax collector.
[257.52 --> 258.46]  Now, in our day,
[258.82 --> 263.42]  many of us already have a bit of disdain and distrust and dislike for the tax man.
[263.42 --> 265.48]  But in Jesus' time,
[265.56 --> 266.66]  it was much more so,
[267.12 --> 267.92]  much stronger.
[269.54 --> 271.42]  Israel was under Roman occupation,
[271.96 --> 274.54]  and this meant that they were forced to pay tribute to the Romans.
[275.22 --> 277.56]  They paid so many different types of taxes.
[277.70 --> 280.00]  They paid principal tax and land tax,
[280.06 --> 281.48]  and then there was many others,
[281.60 --> 283.54]  especially for the transportation of goods.
[284.24 --> 286.70]  And then they were even subject to a temple tax.
[286.70 --> 293.20]  And this taxation upon taxation was very heavy burden for the Jewish people to carry.
[294.86 --> 297.78]  And so this extreme taxation, as you can imagine,
[298.14 --> 301.06]  didn't endear the Romans to the Jews,
[301.26 --> 302.76]  to put it mildly.
[304.14 --> 307.40]  But worse than the Romans in the eyes of the Jews
[307.40 --> 310.16]  were those who collected the taxes.
[310.16 --> 314.64]  Because the collection of taxes was not done by the Romans themselves.
[315.42 --> 317.82]  They subcontracted it to local Jews.
[319.12 --> 322.72]  And these Jews could buy the rights to collect the taxes,
[322.92 --> 324.80]  and then they could skim a little off the top
[324.80 --> 326.36]  and collect extra for themselves.
[327.30 --> 328.60]  And for the Jewish people,
[329.00 --> 330.82]  what was far worse than the Romans
[330.82 --> 332.94]  were their own people
[332.94 --> 335.22]  who would sell them out to make a profit,
[335.22 --> 338.00]  overburden their people,
[338.50 --> 340.54]  collecting tax on behalf of their oppressor.
[342.62 --> 345.06]  And so Jews saw tax collectors
[345.06 --> 346.72]  as the worst kind of sinners.
[347.12 --> 348.28]  They would lump them together
[348.28 --> 350.54]  with beggars and thieves and robbers.
[352.86 --> 354.70]  Most everyone in Israel
[354.70 --> 356.84]  had a strong dislike for tax collectors.
[357.82 --> 359.34]  However, you can imagine people
[359.34 --> 361.32]  that were especially passionate
[361.32 --> 362.30]  for their nation
[362.30 --> 363.48]  and for their people
[363.48 --> 364.46]  and for their God
[364.46 --> 366.62]  would have been the most upset.
[368.64 --> 369.96]  In Jesus' time,
[370.16 --> 372.08]  frustrations against the Romans,
[372.66 --> 374.08]  against the Roman oppression, grew.
[375.62 --> 378.76]  And Jews that were consumed for zeal for God
[378.76 --> 380.84]  were known as zealots.
[381.76 --> 383.12]  They eventually formed a political
[383.12 --> 384.24]  and religious movement
[384.24 --> 387.08]  looking to rid Israel of Roman oppression,
[387.68 --> 390.38]  to take back their land for God by force.
[390.38 --> 393.76]  They saw themselves as God's means
[393.76 --> 394.72]  of divine judgment.
[396.38 --> 397.08]  The zealots,
[397.30 --> 399.14]  with their extreme passionate love
[399.14 --> 400.78]  for their people and their land,
[401.00 --> 402.62]  were the most upset
[402.62 --> 404.80]  with tax collectors
[404.80 --> 407.28]  that would betray their country.
[407.28 --> 413.66]  So, it's not recorded in the Bible,
[413.82 --> 415.06]  but I would love to have been
[415.06 --> 416.16]  a fly on the wall
[416.16 --> 418.16]  as Simon the zealot
[418.16 --> 419.42]  was called by Jesus.
[420.90 --> 422.20]  He was likely excited
[422.20 --> 423.82]  and passionate to serve God.
[425.10 --> 427.24]  But just imagine the look on his face
[427.24 --> 428.10]  when he found out
[428.10 --> 430.28]  that Jesus had also called Matthew
[430.28 --> 431.28]  the tax collector.
[431.28 --> 434.48]  We can imagine the internal friction
[434.48 --> 435.38]  that there would have been
[435.38 --> 436.44]  within the disciples.
[438.92 --> 440.66]  And so, this is probably why
[440.66 --> 441.94]  Peter is asking the question,
[442.36 --> 443.66]  Jesus, what are you doing?
[445.52 --> 446.92]  How do you start a movement
[446.92 --> 449.16]  and then bring enemies together?
[450.72 --> 451.48]  Don't you remember
[451.48 --> 452.58]  what you yourself said?
[452.94 --> 454.62]  A kingdom divided against itself
[454.62 --> 455.38]  can't stand.
[455.38 --> 460.06]  And yet, this was no mistake.
[461.68 --> 463.32]  When we look at Luke's account
[463.32 --> 464.66]  of the call of the disciples,
[464.90 --> 465.76]  we see that Jesus
[465.76 --> 467.88]  went up on a mountainside alone
[467.88 --> 469.24]  and he spent the night
[469.24 --> 470.32]  praying to God
[470.32 --> 472.32]  before coming down
[472.32 --> 473.82]  and calling his disciples
[473.82 --> 475.70]  the next morning.
[481.44 --> 482.68]  Knowing this, I think
[482.68 --> 484.66]  if we're honest with ourselves,
[484.66 --> 485.96]  we can all be left
[485.96 --> 487.34]  scratching our head, you know?
[488.42 --> 489.44]  Jesus, how could you call
[489.44 --> 490.56]  both a tax collector
[490.56 --> 492.32]  and a zealot?
[494.02 --> 495.26]  The radical love
[495.26 --> 497.10]  and diversity that Jesus shows
[497.10 --> 498.50]  in selecting his disciples
[498.50 --> 500.52]  is bewildering to us.
[501.66 --> 503.06]  And yet, never has it been
[503.06 --> 504.76]  more relevant to us.
[506.16 --> 507.76]  We, too, are both like
[507.76 --> 508.96]  Simon the zealot
[508.96 --> 510.56]  and Matthew the tax collector.
[511.70 --> 513.28]  We exclude others
[513.28 --> 514.80]  and we, too,
[514.92 --> 515.70]  are excluded.
[517.50 --> 518.38]  In this world,
[518.44 --> 519.60]  we don't tend to seek out
[519.60 --> 520.60]  diverse perspectives.
[521.32 --> 522.36]  We look to those
[522.36 --> 523.44]  who agree with us.
[524.14 --> 525.20]  And it's on this basis
[525.20 --> 527.00]  that we form our groups,
[527.22 --> 527.96]  how we decide
[527.96 --> 529.22]  whose team that we're on.
[529.86 --> 531.06]  If people agree with us,
[531.10 --> 531.62]  then they're in.
[531.80 --> 533.16]  And if they don't agree with us,
[533.24 --> 534.02]  then they're out.
[534.42 --> 536.02]  And so the division begins.
[536.02 --> 540.86]  Jesus says in his Sermon on the Mount,
[541.02 --> 542.86]  if you love those who love you,
[542.92 --> 544.28]  what reward will you get?
[544.68 --> 545.88]  Are not even the tax collectors
[545.88 --> 546.46]  doing that?
[547.48 --> 548.44]  And if you greet only
[548.44 --> 549.22]  your own people,
[549.44 --> 550.16]  what are you doing
[550.16 --> 550.94]  more than others?
[551.60 --> 553.30]  Do not even the Gentiles do that?
[555.22 --> 556.66]  Our world is becoming
[556.66 --> 557.84]  more divisive.
[559.46 --> 561.24]  We see this in party politics.
[562.04 --> 563.58]  Some of us choose one party,
[563.58 --> 564.84]  and it's our loyal team,
[565.20 --> 567.02]  liberal, conservative, or NDP.
[568.36 --> 569.82]  And we do our best to agree
[569.82 --> 571.08]  with everything that they say
[571.08 --> 572.68]  and justify and defend
[572.68 --> 573.92]  their imperfections.
[574.52 --> 575.86]  And then we see the worst
[575.86 --> 576.96]  in the other parties,
[577.92 --> 579.24]  gracious towards our team
[579.24 --> 580.56]  and without grace
[580.56 --> 581.48]  towards the other team,
[582.16 --> 582.62]  the enemy.
[585.14 --> 586.86]  There was a time in politics
[586.86 --> 588.52]  when we agreed on the goal
[588.52 --> 589.80]  of improving the country,
[589.96 --> 591.30]  but simply disagreed
[591.30 --> 592.34]  on the way to get there.
[592.34 --> 593.70]  But now,
[594.78 --> 595.66]  the trend is to paint
[595.66 --> 596.96]  the other side as evil
[596.96 --> 598.84]  and looking to destroy the nation.
[602.20 --> 603.48]  Much closer to home
[603.48 --> 604.24]  for some of us,
[604.28 --> 605.32]  even in our pockets,
[606.34 --> 607.82]  our culture is working
[607.82 --> 609.28]  to reinforce this attitude
[609.28 --> 610.16]  of division
[610.16 --> 612.46]  through social media
[612.46 --> 613.32]  and our smartphones
[613.32 --> 614.34]  where the average adult
[614.34 --> 616.12]  spends three hours a day.
[616.12 --> 620.36]  I recently watched a documentary
[620.36 --> 620.94]  on Netflix
[620.94 --> 622.38]  called The Social Dilemma,
[622.82 --> 624.18]  which chronicled the ways
[624.18 --> 626.24]  that social media platforms
[626.24 --> 628.96]  profit from keeping people
[628.96 --> 630.06]  addicted to their phones.
[631.50 --> 633.08]  And what the social media empires
[633.08 --> 633.78]  have found
[633.78 --> 636.36]  is that people stay engaged longer
[636.36 --> 638.02]  when there's controversy.
[639.06 --> 639.34]  Right?
[639.34 --> 640.50]  And so,
[640.78 --> 641.88]  social media platforms
[641.88 --> 643.24]  allow and encourage
[643.24 --> 644.58]  controversy to spread
[644.58 --> 645.46]  on social media.
[646.34 --> 647.62]  The extreme perspectives
[647.62 --> 648.20]  prevail
[648.20 --> 649.70]  and they flood
[649.70 --> 650.54]  our news feed.
[651.38 --> 652.44]  And our news feeds
[652.44 --> 653.10]  are customized
[653.10 --> 653.82]  to show us
[653.82 --> 654.56]  the least charitable
[654.56 --> 655.48]  understandings
[655.48 --> 657.50]  of those whom we oppose
[657.50 --> 659.10]  to keep us engaged.
[660.14 --> 661.76]  And it polarizes us.
[663.84 --> 665.18]  But engaging ideas
[665.18 --> 665.96]  through phones
[665.96 --> 666.76]  or computers
[666.76 --> 668.56]  rather than with real people
[668.56 --> 669.92]  that we know
[669.92 --> 671.66]  leads us to flatten people
[671.66 --> 673.40]  into their one belief.
[674.18 --> 675.24]  We equate people
[675.24 --> 676.68]  with that one belief.
[677.46 --> 678.88]  And when we caricature people
[678.88 --> 680.04]  based on one belief,
[680.52 --> 681.66]  we are essentially
[681.66 --> 682.94]  dehumanizing them.
[684.14 --> 686.00]  Because human beings
[686.00 --> 687.18]  are far more complex
[687.18 --> 688.26]  than one belief
[688.26 --> 689.28]  on one subject.
[689.62 --> 690.86]  There's always far more
[690.86 --> 692.10]  behind why we choose
[692.10 --> 693.12]  to see the best
[693.12 --> 694.32]  on one side of an issue
[694.32 --> 695.46]  and the worst on another
[695.46 --> 697.16]  rather than vice versa.
[699.78 --> 701.44]  But when we delve deeper
[701.44 --> 702.30]  into relationship
[702.30 --> 703.46]  in real community,
[703.82 --> 704.80]  when someone is sitting
[704.80 --> 705.96]  with us face to face
[705.96 --> 706.68]  and we engage
[706.68 --> 707.50]  with them personally,
[707.88 --> 709.32]  when we consciously choose
[709.32 --> 710.30]  to love them
[710.30 --> 712.24]  and to try to understand them,
[712.44 --> 713.36]  it is amazing
[713.36 --> 714.78]  how we can grow
[714.78 --> 715.60]  in compassion
[715.60 --> 717.06]  and find common ground.
[717.18 --> 719.88]  the more resilience
[719.88 --> 720.60]  we build
[720.60 --> 721.68]  into our relationships,
[721.84 --> 722.40]  the more deeply
[722.40 --> 723.28]  we know each other,
[723.72 --> 724.78]  the harder it is
[724.78 --> 726.30]  for us to write someone off
[726.30 --> 727.36]  if we disagree with them
[727.36 --> 728.02]  on one issue
[728.02 --> 729.90]  because we have
[729.90 --> 730.64]  many other ties
[730.64 --> 731.60]  that bind us together.
[736.86 --> 738.24]  It's easy to say all this,
[738.36 --> 739.00]  but I can imagine
[739.00 --> 739.68]  for some of you,
[739.74 --> 740.30]  you're sitting there
[740.30 --> 740.94]  and you're thinking,
[740.94 --> 744.56]  and for me myself,
[745.02 --> 746.58]  I can feel like
[746.58 --> 747.58]  I just don't have
[747.58 --> 748.62]  the capacity
[748.62 --> 749.74]  for that kind of empathy.
[751.64 --> 752.46]  Sometimes I just
[752.46 --> 753.46]  can't bridge the gap.
[754.02 --> 755.22]  The disagreement's too large
[755.22 --> 756.88]  and it's too overwhelming.
[759.70 --> 760.64]  Stop for a minute.
[762.54 --> 763.90]  Who do you exclude?
[763.90 --> 766.20]  Who is your tax collector?
[767.94 --> 769.26]  Is it those Christians
[769.26 --> 771.14]  who believe in Black Lives Matter?
[771.60 --> 773.72]  Or perhaps the Christians
[773.72 --> 774.34]  that believe
[774.34 --> 776.16]  in the Proud Boy movement?
[778.80 --> 780.52]  Or perhaps closer to home,
[780.60 --> 781.28]  is it those who
[781.28 --> 783.04]  seek to support the government
[783.04 --> 784.06]  in wearing masks
[784.06 --> 785.00]  and social distancing?
[785.00 --> 787.92]  Or is it those
[787.92 --> 788.60]  in our congregation
[788.60 --> 790.18]  that refuse to wear masks
[790.18 --> 791.60]  and social distance?
[791.60 --> 794.72]  Whether intentional
[794.72 --> 795.78]  or unintentional,
[795.98 --> 797.80]  we all exclude others.
[799.74 --> 801.34]  It seems unavoidable
[801.34 --> 802.28]  and this is why
[802.28 --> 803.24]  we shake our head
[803.24 --> 804.22]  at Jesus calling
[804.22 --> 805.36]  Simon the Zealot
[805.36 --> 806.90]  and Matthew the tax collector.
[810.80 --> 811.80]  For a while,
[811.90 --> 812.62]  I wondered where
[812.62 --> 813.44]  Simon the Zealot
[813.44 --> 814.46]  landed with Matthew,
[814.96 --> 816.50]  how he felt about Matthew.
[818.06 --> 819.32]  But I realized
[819.32 --> 821.30]  it doesn't really matter.
[821.60 --> 824.72]  Jesus did not give Simon
[824.72 --> 826.32]  an option, did he?
[827.50 --> 828.54]  He didn't allow them
[828.54 --> 829.52]  to place stipulations
[829.52 --> 830.22]  on the call.
[831.22 --> 831.82]  Sure, Jesus,
[831.94 --> 832.64]  I'll follow you,
[832.78 --> 833.54]  but you've got to get rid
[833.54 --> 834.70]  of that snake, Matthew.
[835.24 --> 835.96]  You made a mistake
[835.96 --> 836.54]  calling him.
[838.50 --> 839.78]  We don't call the shots
[839.78 --> 840.64]  on being a disciple.
[841.74 --> 842.92]  And Jesus makes this clear
[842.92 --> 843.68]  in Luke 9.
[844.32 --> 845.24]  He merely says,
[845.38 --> 846.42]  let the dead bury the dead.
[847.14 --> 847.74]  Follow me.
[847.74 --> 852.12]  And so when Simon the Zealot
[852.12 --> 854.04]  was unable to bridge the gap
[854.04 --> 856.18]  and find compassion for Matthew,
[856.96 --> 858.60]  he must have had
[858.60 --> 860.40]  a powerful encounter
[860.40 --> 862.18]  with Jesus Christ
[862.18 --> 863.62]  that changed him
[863.62 --> 864.48]  so profoundly
[864.48 --> 865.58]  that his allegiance
[865.58 --> 866.18]  must have been
[866.18 --> 867.62]  completely altered course.
[870.12 --> 870.84]  Simon's allegiance
[870.84 --> 872.24]  became in Christ alone,
[872.42 --> 873.44]  first and foremost,
[873.74 --> 874.96]  not on earthly things,
[874.96 --> 876.16]  but heavenly things,
[876.36 --> 877.92]  so much so
[877.92 --> 878.84]  that it changed
[878.84 --> 880.06]  the way that he treated
[880.06 --> 880.76]  others,
[880.92 --> 881.78]  even his enemies.
[884.52 --> 885.36]  This must have been
[885.36 --> 886.00]  the case for all
[886.00 --> 886.62]  the disciples.
[887.58 --> 888.32]  Accepting the call
[888.32 --> 888.94]  to be a disciple
[888.94 --> 889.52]  would not have been
[889.52 --> 890.00]  a picnic,
[890.64 --> 891.70]  and for Matthew
[891.70 --> 892.84]  or for the others
[892.84 --> 893.72]  either.
[893.72 --> 898.24]  faith in Jesus
[898.24 --> 899.38]  became for the disciples
[899.38 --> 901.28]  the tie that bound them together,
[902.28 --> 903.66]  and it's through Jesus Christ
[903.66 --> 904.68]  they found strength
[904.68 --> 906.14]  to do all things,
[906.72 --> 907.94]  even love someone
[907.94 --> 908.58]  that had betrayed
[908.58 --> 909.92]  their God and country,
[910.22 --> 911.48]  like the lowly tax collector,
[911.64 --> 912.98]  or even go to their death,
[913.86 --> 915.18]  martyred for proclaiming Jesus
[915.18 --> 916.42]  as risen Lord,
[917.08 --> 917.84]  as most of them
[917.84 --> 918.60]  eventually did.
[918.60 --> 921.22]  This is the power
[921.22 --> 922.48]  of an encounter
[922.48 --> 924.34]  with Jesus Christ.
[926.32 --> 928.04]  And this is the good news.
[929.92 --> 931.66]  Our God transforms
[931.66 --> 933.26]  the zealots of this world
[933.26 --> 934.60]  that judge and divide
[934.60 --> 936.16]  into zealots for his kingdom
[936.16 --> 938.04]  who show radical love
[938.04 --> 939.18]  for all people.
[942.26 --> 944.12]  Paul is an example of this.
[946.18 --> 947.26]  Paul's letters compose
[947.26 --> 948.24]  much of the New Testament,
[948.60 --> 949.68]  and his story is told
[949.68 --> 950.58]  in the book of Acts.
[952.26 --> 953.76]  In the book of Galatians,
[954.12 --> 955.18]  Paul describes himself
[955.18 --> 956.24]  as extremely zealous
[956.24 --> 956.96]  for the traditions
[956.96 --> 957.76]  of his father.
[960.08 --> 960.80]  And in Acts,
[961.00 --> 962.08]  we read of how
[962.08 --> 963.14]  a zealous Paul
[963.14 --> 964.32]  approves the murder
[964.32 --> 965.02]  of Stephen,
[965.38 --> 965.94]  a Christian,
[967.16 --> 967.82]  and from there
[967.82 --> 968.38]  goes around
[968.38 --> 969.72]  chasing down Christians
[969.72 --> 970.82]  and throwing them in prison,
[970.94 --> 971.70]  doing his best
[971.70 --> 973.68]  to destroy the early church.
[975.10 --> 976.68]  Paul had chosen his team,
[977.46 --> 978.38]  and Christians were
[978.38 --> 979.20]  on the outside.
[982.04 --> 983.34]  But Paul, too,
[983.96 --> 985.72]  was profoundly changed
[985.72 --> 987.14]  by a powerful encounter
[987.14 --> 987.84]  with God
[987.84 --> 989.60]  on the road to Damascus.
[990.46 --> 991.50]  His allegiance
[991.50 --> 993.24]  and life direction
[993.24 --> 994.12]  completely altered.
[996.12 --> 997.22]  Paul went on
[997.22 --> 997.82]  to found
[997.82 --> 998.58]  and build up
[998.58 --> 999.38]  many churches
[999.38 --> 1000.46]  across Asia Minor
[1000.46 --> 1000.88]  and Europe
[1000.88 --> 1001.68]  and even Rome,
[1002.30 --> 1003.72]  befriending people
[1003.72 --> 1004.84]  of all different sorts
[1004.84 --> 1006.06]  and teaching others
[1006.06 --> 1006.96]  to do the same
[1006.96 --> 1007.82]  through the power
[1007.82 --> 1008.30]  of Jesus.
[1010.80 --> 1011.72]  After God
[1011.72 --> 1012.94]  opened Paul's eyes
[1012.94 --> 1013.60]  to the truth
[1013.60 --> 1014.58]  of Jesus Christ,
[1014.86 --> 1015.54]  he wrote this
[1015.54 --> 1016.54]  to the Philippians
[1016.54 --> 1018.14]  about the
[1018.14 --> 1020.02]  powerful encounter
[1020.02 --> 1020.86]  that he had had
[1020.86 --> 1021.36]  with Christ
[1021.36 --> 1022.36]  and how it affected him.
[1022.36 --> 1025.36]  He said,
[1025.40 --> 1025.96]  if someone else
[1025.96 --> 1026.50]  thinks they have
[1026.50 --> 1027.50]  reason to put confidence
[1027.50 --> 1028.14]  in the flesh,
[1028.20 --> 1028.98]  I have more.
[1030.44 --> 1031.12]  Circumcised on the
[1031.12 --> 1031.64]  eighth day
[1031.64 --> 1032.88]  of the people of Israel,
[1033.58 --> 1034.20]  of the tribe
[1034.20 --> 1034.88]  of Benjamin,
[1035.60 --> 1036.70]  a Hebrew of Hebrews,
[1037.18 --> 1038.60]  in regards to the law,
[1038.74 --> 1039.58]  a Pharisee,
[1039.84 --> 1040.62]  as for zeal,
[1040.80 --> 1041.82]  persecuting the church,
[1041.94 --> 1042.72]  as for righteousness
[1042.72 --> 1043.74]  based on the law,
[1044.22 --> 1044.74]  faultless.
[1044.74 --> 1048.96]  But whatever
[1048.96 --> 1050.20]  were gains to me,
[1050.46 --> 1051.28]  I now consider
[1051.28 --> 1051.86]  a loss
[1051.86 --> 1052.34]  for the sake
[1052.34 --> 1052.92]  of Christ.
[1053.88 --> 1054.80]  What is more,
[1054.90 --> 1055.32]  I consider
[1055.32 --> 1056.36]  everything a loss
[1056.36 --> 1057.12]  because of the
[1057.12 --> 1058.08]  surpassing worth
[1058.08 --> 1059.08]  of knowing Christ
[1059.08 --> 1060.12]  Jesus my Lord,
[1061.14 --> 1061.96]  for whose sake
[1061.96 --> 1062.68]  I have lost
[1062.68 --> 1063.42]  all things.
[1064.60 --> 1065.42]  I consider them
[1065.42 --> 1065.86]  garbage
[1065.86 --> 1067.50]  that I may gain
[1067.50 --> 1068.02]  Christ
[1068.02 --> 1069.04]  and be found
[1069.04 --> 1069.54]  in him,
[1069.94 --> 1070.60]  not having a
[1070.60 --> 1071.76]  righteousness of my own
[1071.76 --> 1072.52]  that comes from
[1072.52 --> 1072.98]  the law,
[1073.62 --> 1074.32]  but that which
[1074.32 --> 1074.80]  comes through
[1074.80 --> 1075.92]  faith in Christ,
[1076.52 --> 1077.12]  the righteousness
[1077.12 --> 1078.48]  that comes from God
[1078.48 --> 1079.94]  on the basis of faith.
[1082.52 --> 1083.74]  This is a completely
[1083.74 --> 1084.78]  altered life,
[1085.92 --> 1086.52]  a completely
[1086.52 --> 1087.32]  altered allegiance.
[1089.62 --> 1090.68]  And we see
[1090.68 --> 1091.38]  in Ephesians
[1091.38 --> 1092.42]  how this profoundly
[1092.42 --> 1094.44]  affects Paul's view
[1094.44 --> 1095.16]  of relationship
[1095.16 --> 1095.88]  with others.
[1097.68 --> 1098.46]  Paul says,
[1099.38 --> 1099.96]  be completely
[1099.96 --> 1100.98]  humble and gentle,
[1102.10 --> 1103.14]  be patient,
[1103.14 --> 1104.62]  bearing with one
[1104.62 --> 1105.56]  another in love.
[1107.42 --> 1108.64]  Make every effort
[1108.64 --> 1109.20]  to keep
[1109.20 --> 1110.06]  the unity
[1110.06 --> 1111.60]  of the Spirit
[1111.60 --> 1112.40]  through the bond
[1112.40 --> 1113.04]  of peace.
[1114.84 --> 1116.10]  There is one body
[1116.10 --> 1117.18]  and one Spirit,
[1117.62 --> 1118.18]  just as you were
[1118.18 --> 1119.42]  called to one hope
[1119.42 --> 1120.58]  when you were called,
[1120.98 --> 1121.64]  one Lord,
[1122.04 --> 1122.74]  one faith,
[1123.10 --> 1123.90]  one baptism,
[1124.18 --> 1124.78]  one God
[1124.78 --> 1125.76]  and Father of all,
[1126.40 --> 1127.42]  who is over all
[1127.42 --> 1128.78]  and through all
[1128.78 --> 1130.48]  and in all.
[1134.32 --> 1135.34]  And as we read
[1135.34 --> 1136.62]  of God's work
[1136.62 --> 1137.66]  through Paul's life
[1137.66 --> 1138.10]  and acts
[1138.10 --> 1138.66]  and his letters,
[1139.66 --> 1140.68]  we can see
[1140.68 --> 1141.28]  that it is an
[1141.28 --> 1142.20]  astounding testimony
[1142.20 --> 1143.18]  to the transformation
[1143.18 --> 1145.20]  he did in Paul's heart.
[1148.06 --> 1149.08]  But our God
[1149.08 --> 1150.02]  does not place
[1150.02 --> 1151.20]  burdens on us
[1151.20 --> 1152.30]  to try to live
[1152.30 --> 1153.30]  in possible kindness.
[1153.30 --> 1156.88]  He's called
[1156.88 --> 1157.98]  each one of us
[1157.98 --> 1160.64]  and he seeks
[1160.64 --> 1161.38]  to encounter
[1161.38 --> 1162.58]  each one of us
[1162.58 --> 1164.02]  and he empowers
[1164.02 --> 1165.22]  each one of us
[1165.22 --> 1167.24]  and he himself,
[1167.46 --> 1167.80]  God,
[1168.22 --> 1169.46]  journeys with us
[1169.46 --> 1171.04]  through his Holy Spirit.
[1173.44 --> 1174.46]  He calls us
[1174.46 --> 1174.98]  the same way
[1174.98 --> 1176.06]  he called his disciples
[1176.06 --> 1178.00]  and in this call
[1178.00 --> 1179.06]  he brings zealots
[1179.06 --> 1179.96]  and tax collectors
[1179.96 --> 1180.52]  together,
[1180.98 --> 1181.66]  sworn enemies
[1181.66 --> 1182.46]  in this world
[1182.46 --> 1183.98]  with very different agendas
[1183.98 --> 1186.38]  and he confronts us
[1186.38 --> 1188.36]  with the humanity
[1188.36 --> 1189.32]  and image of God
[1189.32 --> 1189.94]  in each other
[1189.94 --> 1193.24]  while revealing to us
[1193.24 --> 1195.02]  our own humanity
[1195.02 --> 1196.22]  and image of God.
[1197.60 --> 1198.90]  He confronts us
[1198.90 --> 1200.54]  with the worldly boxes
[1200.54 --> 1201.86]  that we put others in
[1201.86 --> 1203.50]  and have ourselves
[1203.50 --> 1204.20]  been put in.
[1205.98 --> 1207.58]  He confronts us
[1207.58 --> 1208.50]  with how we have
[1208.50 --> 1209.36]  excluded others
[1209.36 --> 1210.70]  and how we have
[1210.70 --> 1211.26]  been excluded.
[1212.54 --> 1213.50]  He confronts
[1213.50 --> 1214.22]  our divisiveness
[1214.22 --> 1215.60]  with radical love
[1215.60 --> 1216.14]  for all,
[1216.30 --> 1217.12]  even our enemies.
[1220.58 --> 1222.06]  Jesus empowers us
[1222.06 --> 1223.02]  to sit in the tension
[1223.02 --> 1224.54]  of loving someone
[1224.54 --> 1225.36]  who is our enemy,
[1225.94 --> 1228.06]  to see the nuance
[1228.06 --> 1229.36]  that they are more
[1229.36 --> 1230.74]  than one idea
[1230.74 --> 1231.42]  or belief.
[1232.28 --> 1233.22]  He empowers us
[1233.22 --> 1234.46]  to live as he did
[1234.46 --> 1235.96]  as described beautifully
[1235.96 --> 1238.24]  by Paul in Romans 5
[1238.24 --> 1238.72]  as we heard
[1238.72 --> 1239.34]  in our confession
[1239.34 --> 1240.32]  and assurance today.
[1240.32 --> 1243.56]  While we were yet sinners,
[1243.88 --> 1245.20]  he died for us.
[1246.56 --> 1247.36]  Paul says,
[1247.76 --> 1248.30]  we might die
[1248.30 --> 1249.08]  for a good man,
[1249.14 --> 1249.84]  but for our enemy,
[1250.02 --> 1250.86]  not a chance.
[1251.52 --> 1253.16]  But this is the power
[1253.16 --> 1254.18]  of God's love.
[1255.66 --> 1256.68]  On the cross,
[1256.80 --> 1257.46]  Jesus Christ,
[1257.84 --> 1258.88]  while being crucified
[1258.88 --> 1260.14]  unjustly,
[1260.88 --> 1262.14]  he prayed for them
[1262.14 --> 1263.66]  as they mocked
[1263.66 --> 1264.42]  and murdered him.
[1264.42 --> 1266.90]  He saw them
[1266.90 --> 1268.46]  as more than their mistake.
[1269.68 --> 1271.04]  He saw the nuance.
[1272.28 --> 1273.02]  He saw the image
[1273.02 --> 1273.66]  of God
[1273.66 --> 1274.86]  in each of them.
[1276.82 --> 1277.34]  Forgive them,
[1277.52 --> 1277.70]  Lord,
[1278.20 --> 1279.22]  for they know not
[1279.22 --> 1280.04]  what they're doing.
[1284.26 --> 1284.78]  Forgive
[1284.78 --> 1285.60]  as the Lord
[1285.60 --> 1286.36]  forgave you.
[1286.36 --> 1290.54]  Jesus radically
[1290.54 --> 1291.50]  empowers us
[1291.50 --> 1292.14]  to question
[1292.14 --> 1293.22]  who we can put
[1293.22 --> 1294.02]  on the outside.
[1295.22 --> 1296.08]  Is there anyone?
[1297.12 --> 1298.30]  If the prostitutes
[1298.30 --> 1299.18]  and tax collectors
[1299.18 --> 1300.52]  are to be loved,
[1301.32 --> 1302.56]  if our enemy
[1302.56 --> 1303.30]  is to be loved,
[1303.46 --> 1304.52]  who can we turn away?
[1307.52 --> 1308.00]  Judgment
[1308.00 --> 1308.76]  is to be left
[1308.76 --> 1309.40]  in the hands
[1309.40 --> 1310.12]  of the good
[1310.12 --> 1311.22]  and just judge,
[1311.36 --> 1312.16]  Jesus Christ.
[1312.96 --> 1313.76]  But it can be
[1313.76 --> 1314.28]  so tempting
[1314.28 --> 1314.90]  to want to sit
[1314.90 --> 1315.46]  in that seat
[1315.46 --> 1316.08]  ourselves.
[1316.36 --> 1317.04]  Can it?
[1319.72 --> 1320.48]  But how could
[1320.48 --> 1321.12]  we possibly
[1321.12 --> 1322.34]  be so loving?
[1322.68 --> 1323.32]  It seems like
[1323.32 --> 1324.44]  the impossible task.
[1325.68 --> 1326.44]  We would need
[1326.44 --> 1327.40]  to be so patient
[1327.40 --> 1329.08]  and kind
[1329.08 --> 1330.28]  and gentle
[1330.28 --> 1331.38]  and loving.
[1332.62 --> 1333.54]  We would need
[1333.54 --> 1334.50]  superhuman
[1334.50 --> 1335.62]  self-control.
[1336.98 --> 1337.76]  We'd need
[1337.76 --> 1338.60]  deep resources
[1338.60 --> 1339.38]  for joy
[1339.38 --> 1339.98]  and goodness
[1339.98 --> 1341.12]  and peace.
[1343.46 --> 1344.44]  We would need
[1344.44 --> 1344.86]  the fruits
[1344.86 --> 1345.48]  of the Spirit.
[1346.36 --> 1347.36]  fruit of the Spirit.
[1348.68 --> 1349.66]  But these only
[1349.66 --> 1350.24]  come through
[1350.24 --> 1350.78]  relationship
[1350.78 --> 1351.42]  with Jesus.
[1352.64 --> 1353.72]  When we follow
[1353.72 --> 1354.10]  Him,
[1355.10 --> 1356.04]  when we are
[1356.04 --> 1356.88]  consumed for love
[1356.88 --> 1357.42]  with Him,
[1359.02 --> 1360.30]  when the rest
[1360.30 --> 1360.82]  of the world
[1360.82 --> 1361.54]  seems like filthy
[1361.54 --> 1362.10]  rags
[1362.10 --> 1363.46]  by comparison.
[1363.46 --> 1364.46]  God's love
[1364.46 --> 1365.46]  love
[1365.46 --> 1366.46]  and love
[1366.46 --> 1367.10]  God's
[1367.10 --> 1367.90]  love
[1367.90 --> 1368.46]  and love
[1368.46 --> 1369.10]  God's
[1369.10 --> 1369.94]  love
[1369.94 --> 1370.46]  and love
[1370.46 --> 1370.62]  love
[1370.62 --> 1371.16]  our enemies
[1371.16 --> 1371.72]  insofar
[1371.72 --> 1372.16]  as we are
[1372.16 --> 1372.72]  in Him,
[1373.44 --> 1373.82]  in deep
[1373.82 --> 1374.40]  relationship
[1374.40 --> 1374.94]  with Jesus
[1374.94 --> 1375.40]  Christ,
[1375.46 --> 1376.12]  when we reflect
[1376.12 --> 1376.72]  on Him
[1376.72 --> 1377.64]  and when we
[1377.64 --> 1378.16]  are praying
[1378.16 --> 1378.64]  to Him
[1378.64 --> 1379.34]  and we hear
[1379.34 --> 1379.84]  Him speak
[1379.84 --> 1380.28]  to us
[1380.28 --> 1380.64]  in His
[1380.64 --> 1381.12]  Word
[1381.12 --> 1382.58]  and rest
[1382.58 --> 1383.06]  in Him
[1383.06 --> 1384.00]  when we
[1384.00 --> 1384.54]  abide in
[1384.54 --> 1385.06]  the One
[1385.06 --> 1386.70]  who Himself
[1386.70 --> 1387.22]  loved His
[1387.22 --> 1387.60]  enemies,
[1388.60 --> 1389.64]  who chose
[1389.64 --> 1390.10]  to remain
[1390.10 --> 1390.76]  nailed to the
[1390.76 --> 1391.66]  cross and
[1391.66 --> 1392.14]  prayed for
[1392.14 --> 1392.52]  those who
[1392.52 --> 1392.88]  put Him
[1392.88 --> 1393.16]  there
[1393.16 --> 1393.70]  in order
[1393.70 --> 1394.12]  to bridge
[1394.12 --> 1394.58]  the gap
[1394.58 --> 1395.34]  between us
[1395.34 --> 1395.90]  and God.
[1398.58 --> 1400.06]  He reconciled
[1400.06 --> 1400.72]  for us
[1400.72 --> 1401.40]  our relationship
[1401.40 --> 1402.08]  with God
[1402.08 --> 1403.10]  and as we
[1403.10 --> 1403.56]  grow in
[1403.56 --> 1404.00]  relationship
[1404.00 --> 1404.50]  with Him,
[1404.82 --> 1405.50]  He empowers
[1405.50 --> 1406.18]  us to bridge
[1406.18 --> 1406.76]  the gap
[1406.76 --> 1407.82]  with all
[1407.82 --> 1408.38]  those around
[1408.38 --> 1409.96]  us so that
[1409.96 --> 1410.42]  we may
[1410.42 --> 1411.78]  exemplify Him,
[1412.22 --> 1412.60]  be a living
[1412.60 --> 1413.64]  testimony to Him
[1413.64 --> 1414.64]  and promote
[1414.64 --> 1415.32]  flourishing
[1415.32 --> 1416.92]  as a sign
[1416.92 --> 1417.74]  of the truth
[1417.74 --> 1418.22]  of who He
[1418.22 --> 1418.60]  is.
[1421.66 --> 1422.14]  We need
[1422.14 --> 1422.70]  this now
[1422.70 --> 1423.18]  more than
[1423.18 --> 1423.50]  ever.
[1424.76 --> 1425.48]  As we
[1425.48 --> 1426.18]  scroll our
[1426.18 --> 1426.84]  news feeds
[1426.84 --> 1427.34]  that sow
[1427.34 --> 1427.86]  division,
[1429.06 --> 1430.06]  as COVID
[1430.06 --> 1431.14]  polarizes us
[1431.14 --> 1431.60]  as to how
[1431.60 --> 1432.32]  to respond,
[1433.60 --> 1434.18]  as the
[1434.18 --> 1434.62]  American
[1434.62 --> 1435.22]  political
[1435.22 --> 1435.84]  circus
[1435.84 --> 1436.34]  marches
[1436.34 --> 1436.74]  on,
[1441.08 --> 1441.84]  maybe we
[1441.84 --> 1442.20]  can turn
[1442.20 --> 1442.62]  off our
[1442.62 --> 1443.22]  phones this
[1443.22 --> 1443.50]  week,
[1443.76 --> 1444.60]  just for a
[1444.60 --> 1445.00]  half hour
[1445.00 --> 1445.38]  longer,
[1446.08 --> 1447.78]  and turn
[1447.78 --> 1448.14]  on our
[1448.14 --> 1448.60]  hearts,
[1449.66 --> 1450.28]  engage in
[1450.28 --> 1450.40]  our
[1450.40 --> 1450.92]  relationship
[1450.92 --> 1451.64]  with God
[1451.64 --> 1452.34]  who loves
[1452.34 --> 1452.76]  us.
[1455.78 --> 1456.64]  When we
[1456.64 --> 1457.52]  sincerely seek
[1457.52 --> 1458.22]  God to have
[1458.22 --> 1458.74]  relationship
[1458.74 --> 1459.32]  with Him,
[1460.72 --> 1461.24]  the more
[1461.24 --> 1461.86]  we do it,
[1461.94 --> 1462.48]  He changes
[1462.48 --> 1463.30]  us from
[1463.30 --> 1463.70]  zealots
[1463.70 --> 1464.40]  looking to
[1464.40 --> 1465.22]  kill those
[1465.22 --> 1465.70]  who disagree
[1465.70 --> 1466.38]  with us
[1466.38 --> 1467.40]  to zealots
[1467.40 --> 1468.08]  who engage
[1468.08 --> 1468.50]  the world
[1468.50 --> 1469.24]  around them,
[1470.74 --> 1471.64]  gathering God's
[1471.64 --> 1472.22]  children and
[1472.22 --> 1473.08]  loving on all
[1473.08 --> 1473.46]  who need
[1473.46 --> 1473.90]  love.
[1474.40 --> 1475.20]  We're filled
[1475.20 --> 1475.76]  with love,
[1475.86 --> 1476.20]  we're filled
[1476.20 --> 1477.04]  with the
[1477.04 --> 1477.40]  fruits of
[1477.40 --> 1477.96]  His Spirit.
[1477.96 --> 1478.72]  God
[1478.72 --> 1489.04]  encounters us
[1489.04 --> 1489.44]  today in
[1489.44 --> 1490.18]  many ways,
[1491.18 --> 1492.12]  but as I
[1492.12 --> 1492.40]  have been
[1492.40 --> 1492.80]  growing in
[1492.80 --> 1493.34]  my faith
[1493.34 --> 1493.92]  walk as a
[1493.92 --> 1494.26]  Christian,
[1494.86 --> 1495.72]  I have found
[1495.72 --> 1496.14]  more and
[1496.14 --> 1496.80]  more that it
[1496.80 --> 1497.16]  is in the
[1497.16 --> 1497.54]  Lord's
[1497.54 --> 1498.72]  Supper I
[1498.72 --> 1499.16]  encounter
[1499.16 --> 1500.84]  Jesus
[1500.84 --> 1501.58]  powerfully.
[1502.26 --> 1503.20]  Like Simon
[1503.20 --> 1503.78]  the Zealot
[1503.78 --> 1504.50]  encountered
[1504.50 --> 1504.84]  Jesus
[1504.84 --> 1505.42]  powerfully,
[1505.62 --> 1506.36]  like Paul
[1506.36 --> 1506.86]  encountered
[1506.86 --> 1507.22]  Jesus
[1507.22 --> 1507.82]  powerfully.
[1508.40 --> 1508.76]  There is
[1508.76 --> 1509.94]  indeed a
[1509.94 --> 1510.32]  powerful
[1510.32 --> 1511.06]  mystery far
[1511.06 --> 1511.80]  beyond bread
[1511.80 --> 1512.44]  and juice.
[1515.40 --> 1515.98]  Jesus
[1515.98 --> 1516.86]  invited Matthew
[1516.86 --> 1517.36]  the tax
[1517.36 --> 1518.06]  collector and
[1518.06 --> 1518.62]  Simon the
[1518.62 --> 1519.80]  Zealot to
[1519.80 --> 1520.50]  His table,
[1521.10 --> 1521.42]  and He
[1521.42 --> 1521.90]  broke bread
[1521.90 --> 1522.26]  with them.
[1524.48 --> 1525.08]  Today,
[1525.20 --> 1525.78]  Jesus Christ
[1525.78 --> 1526.36]  invites you
[1526.36 --> 1526.74]  to His
[1526.74 --> 1527.68]  table to
[1527.68 --> 1528.20]  break bread.
[1531.42 --> 1532.00]  Now,
[1532.12 --> 1532.68]  a funny thing
[1532.68 --> 1533.18]  happened to
[1533.18 --> 1533.58]  me as I
[1533.58 --> 1534.16]  was preparing
[1534.16 --> 1534.86]  this sermon.
[1534.86 --> 1536.42]  it felt like
[1536.42 --> 1536.82]  one of those
[1536.82 --> 1537.30]  times when
[1537.30 --> 1537.68]  God's
[1537.68 --> 1538.20]  winking at
[1538.20 --> 1538.40]  you.
[1540.04 --> 1540.60]  I was
[1540.60 --> 1540.80]  eating
[1540.80 --> 1541.44]  breakfast and
[1541.44 --> 1541.88]  I did my
[1541.88 --> 1542.86]  devotions and
[1542.86 --> 1543.34]  it was on
[1543.34 --> 1544.12]  Psalm 23.
[1545.50 --> 1546.26]  And as I
[1546.26 --> 1546.60]  read it,
[1546.64 --> 1547.18]  this is what I
[1547.18 --> 1547.62]  heard.
[1547.78 --> 1548.00]  Now,
[1548.32 --> 1549.80]  I've read
[1549.80 --> 1550.66]  Psalm 23 a
[1550.66 --> 1551.46]  million times,
[1551.46 --> 1552.42]  but this day
[1552.42 --> 1553.20]  I heard it
[1553.20 --> 1553.60]  anew.
[1556.04 --> 1557.28]  You prepare a
[1557.28 --> 1558.18]  table for me
[1558.18 --> 1559.66]  in the
[1559.66 --> 1560.56]  presence of
[1560.56 --> 1561.32]  my enemies.
[1564.00 --> 1564.56]  You
[1564.56 --> 1565.06]  anoint my
[1565.06 --> 1566.26]  head with
[1566.26 --> 1566.72]  oil and
[1566.72 --> 1567.14]  my cup
[1567.14 --> 1567.88]  overflows.
[1571.20 --> 1571.76]  You
[1571.76 --> 1572.30]  prepare a
[1572.30 --> 1572.90]  table for
[1572.90 --> 1573.40]  me in the
[1573.40 --> 1574.12]  presence of
[1574.12 --> 1574.82]  my enemies.
[1577.00 --> 1577.54]  Now,
[1577.62 --> 1578.04]  personally,
[1578.50 --> 1579.84]  for this
[1579.84 --> 1580.48]  verse of
[1580.48 --> 1581.10]  Psalm 23,
[1581.22 --> 1581.56]  I think in
[1581.56 --> 1582.14]  the past
[1582.14 --> 1584.12]  I maybe
[1584.12 --> 1584.50]  had more
[1584.50 --> 1584.70]  of a
[1584.70 --> 1585.38]  vindictive
[1585.38 --> 1585.98]  view of
[1585.98 --> 1586.24]  this,
[1586.32 --> 1586.52]  like it
[1586.52 --> 1588.16]  was vindication,
[1588.18 --> 1589.00]  maybe,
[1589.18 --> 1589.46]  like,
[1589.74 --> 1589.96]  ha,
[1590.18 --> 1590.76]  see enemies?
[1591.18 --> 1591.64]  God is with
[1591.64 --> 1591.88]  me,
[1591.96 --> 1592.54]  not you.
[1594.50 --> 1595.08]  But I
[1595.08 --> 1595.38]  think I
[1595.38 --> 1596.00]  was wrong
[1596.00 --> 1596.42]  in how I
[1596.42 --> 1596.78]  was reading
[1596.78 --> 1597.16]  this.
[1599.52 --> 1600.06]  Perhaps
[1600.06 --> 1600.56]  this is a
[1600.56 --> 1601.30]  beautiful picture
[1601.30 --> 1602.66]  of reconciled
[1602.66 --> 1603.30]  relationships,
[1604.52 --> 1605.34]  of peace
[1605.34 --> 1606.18]  that
[1606.18 --> 1606.98]  transcends
[1606.98 --> 1607.44]  all
[1607.44 --> 1608.12]  understanding.
[1609.48 --> 1610.02]  These were
[1610.02 --> 1611.16]  enemies and
[1611.16 --> 1611.68]  now we
[1611.68 --> 1612.54]  feast together.
[1614.06 --> 1614.70]  The power
[1614.70 --> 1615.34]  of God's
[1615.34 --> 1616.14]  love to
[1616.14 --> 1616.54]  overcome
[1616.54 --> 1617.04]  our
[1617.04 --> 1617.88]  brokenness.
[1618.18 --> 1621.12]  this is a
[1621.12 --> 1621.48]  picture of
[1621.48 --> 1621.82]  the Last
[1621.82 --> 1622.28]  Supper with
[1622.28 --> 1622.62]  Jesus.
[1623.02 --> 1623.22]  Both
[1623.22 --> 1623.88]  Matthew and
[1623.88 --> 1624.94]  Simon are
[1624.94 --> 1625.32]  there,
[1626.16 --> 1626.58]  former
[1626.58 --> 1627.12]  enemies.
[1628.80 --> 1629.48]  And Judas
[1629.48 --> 1630.08]  is there
[1630.08 --> 1630.46]  too,
[1630.60 --> 1631.02]  isn't he?
[1632.30 --> 1633.18]  They all
[1633.18 --> 1633.50]  end up
[1633.50 --> 1634.00]  betraying
[1634.00 --> 1634.36]  Jesus.
[1634.70 --> 1635.10]  Jesus is
[1635.10 --> 1635.62]  alone on
[1635.62 --> 1636.18]  the cross,
[1636.48 --> 1637.22]  and he
[1637.22 --> 1637.82]  knows what's
[1637.82 --> 1638.10]  coming,
[1638.24 --> 1638.60]  and yet he
[1638.60 --> 1639.16]  breaks bread
[1639.16 --> 1639.54]  with them.
[1639.54 --> 1641.54]  God's
[1641.54 --> 1642.54]  peace.
[1642.54 --> 1643.42]  I wonder
[1643.42 --> 1644.24]  if instead
[1644.24 --> 1644.84]  we are
[1644.84 --> 1645.22]  anointed
[1645.22 --> 1646.52]  because we
[1646.52 --> 1647.14]  break bread
[1647.14 --> 1647.60]  with our
[1647.60 --> 1648.06]  enemies,
[1648.66 --> 1649.76]  because we
[1649.76 --> 1650.46]  make God's
[1650.46 --> 1651.02]  peace our
[1651.02 --> 1651.62]  peace with
[1651.62 --> 1652.24]  all people,
[1652.64 --> 1653.80]  and this is a
[1653.80 --> 1654.54]  sign of God's
[1654.54 --> 1655.42]  work in us,
[1655.84 --> 1656.88]  and he eats
[1656.88 --> 1657.46]  with us and
[1657.46 --> 1658.40]  anoints us as
[1658.40 --> 1658.96]  his chosen.
[1662.76 --> 1663.28]  Perhaps
[1663.28 --> 1664.00]  God's peace
[1664.00 --> 1664.88]  that transcends
[1664.88 --> 1665.72]  all understanding
[1665.72 --> 1666.54]  is not just a
[1666.54 --> 1667.56]  peace despite
[1667.56 --> 1668.28]  the broken
[1668.28 --> 1668.88]  relationships
[1668.88 --> 1669.76]  of this world,
[1670.50 --> 1671.94]  but a peace
[1671.94 --> 1672.46]  due to the
[1672.46 --> 1674.02]  reconciling of
[1674.02 --> 1674.44]  the broken
[1674.44 --> 1675.06]  relationships
[1675.06 --> 1676.04]  of this world.
[1678.94 --> 1679.74]  There are
[1679.74 --> 1680.58]  likely people
[1680.58 --> 1681.04]  that are in
[1681.04 --> 1681.50]  this church
[1681.50 --> 1682.16]  right now
[1682.16 --> 1683.84]  who have
[1683.84 --> 1684.46]  disagreed in
[1684.46 --> 1685.06]  the past,
[1685.18 --> 1685.74]  or perhaps
[1685.74 --> 1686.16]  are still
[1686.16 --> 1686.94]  disagreeing on
[1686.94 --> 1687.36]  things,
[1688.70 --> 1691.12]  but such
[1691.12 --> 1691.74]  is the power
[1691.74 --> 1692.26]  of God's
[1692.26 --> 1692.70]  love to
[1692.70 --> 1693.20]  overcome,
[1694.36 --> 1694.76]  to make
[1694.76 --> 1695.24]  peace in
[1695.24 --> 1695.56]  the midst
[1695.56 --> 1696.38]  of squabbles,
[1696.90 --> 1697.24]  today,
[1697.24 --> 1697.74]  together,
[1697.98 --> 1698.66]  we all
[1698.66 --> 1699.26]  come to
[1699.26 --> 1699.76]  God's
[1699.76 --> 1700.10]  table.
[1701.20 --> 1701.74]  He prepares
[1701.74 --> 1702.12]  a table
[1702.12 --> 1702.54]  for us
[1702.54 --> 1703.26]  all and
[1703.26 --> 1703.82]  encounters
[1703.82 --> 1704.96]  us in
[1704.96 --> 1705.40]  powerful
[1705.40 --> 1705.96]  ways.
[1708.96 --> 1709.70]  And as
[1709.70 --> 1710.30]  we encounter
[1710.30 --> 1710.66]  him,
[1710.96 --> 1711.32]  we're
[1711.32 --> 1712.12]  reconciled to
[1712.12 --> 1712.32]  him,
[1712.46 --> 1712.96]  and by the
[1712.96 --> 1713.28]  Spirit,
[1713.42 --> 1714.62]  God empowers
[1714.62 --> 1715.50]  us and
[1715.50 --> 1716.00]  gives us
[1716.00 --> 1716.60]  the ministry
[1716.60 --> 1716.88]  of
[1716.88 --> 1717.56]  reconciliation.
[1719.74 --> 1720.44]  Blessed are
[1720.44 --> 1721.24]  the peacemakers,
[1721.96 --> 1722.70]  for they will
[1722.70 --> 1723.10]  be called
[1723.10 --> 1723.80]  children of
[1723.80 --> 1724.08]  heaven.
[1724.08 --> 1726.08]  God's
[1726.08 --> 1726.22]  home.
[1726.22 --> 1727.42]  We
[1727.42 --> 1727.90]  regularly
[1727.90 --> 1728.38]  prepare
[1728.38 --> 1729.84]  tables in
[1729.84 --> 1730.20]  our own
[1730.20 --> 1730.54]  home.
[1732.72 --> 1733.58]  Who do
[1733.58 --> 1734.16]  you invite
[1734.16 --> 1734.56]  to your
[1734.56 --> 1735.66]  table when
[1735.66 --> 1736.12]  you prepare
[1736.12 --> 1736.60]  a feast?
[1737.82 --> 1738.72]  What does
[1738.72 --> 1739.34]  Christmas Day
[1739.34 --> 1739.82]  look like
[1739.82 --> 1740.24]  for you?
[1742.18 --> 1743.02]  How do
[1743.02 --> 1743.82]  you exemplify
[1743.82 --> 1744.60]  God's radical
[1744.60 --> 1745.22]  love that
[1745.22 --> 1745.50]  you've
[1745.50 --> 1746.02]  experienced?
[1747.86 --> 1748.70]  Have you
[1748.70 --> 1749.30]  invited your
[1749.30 --> 1750.22]  zealot and
[1750.22 --> 1750.78]  tax collector
[1750.78 --> 1751.24]  to join
[1751.24 --> 1751.54]  you?
[1754.76 --> 1755.28]  In the
[1755.28 --> 1755.48]  name of
[1755.48 --> 1755.80]  the Father,
[1755.96 --> 1756.52]  Son, and
[1756.52 --> 1757.08]  Holy Spirit,
[1758.16 --> 1759.24]  pray with
[1759.24 --> 1759.50]  me.
[1768.02 --> 1768.70]  God of
[1768.70 --> 1769.00]  both
[1769.00 --> 1770.14]  Simon the
[1770.14 --> 1770.68]  zealot and
[1770.68 --> 1771.16]  Matthew the
[1771.16 --> 1771.86]  tax collector,
[1772.70 --> 1775.24]  thank you for
[1775.24 --> 1775.78]  your gracious
[1775.78 --> 1776.66]  invitation to
[1776.66 --> 1777.06]  all.
[1779.20 --> 1779.82]  Thank you,
[1779.90 --> 1780.18]  Lord, that
[1780.18 --> 1781.42]  you see beyond
[1781.42 --> 1782.08]  our faults
[1782.08 --> 1782.72]  and love us
[1782.72 --> 1783.32]  so deeply.
[1785.66 --> 1786.66]  We pray that
[1786.66 --> 1787.34]  your love will
[1787.34 --> 1788.20]  work in us
[1788.20 --> 1788.70]  through your
[1788.70 --> 1791.20]  Spirit, that
[1791.20 --> 1791.94]  we too may
[1791.94 --> 1792.84]  love as you
[1792.84 --> 1794.36]  do, beyond
[1794.36 --> 1794.78]  our own
[1794.78 --> 1796.20]  capacity, beyond
[1796.20 --> 1797.10]  worldly love.
[1798.78 --> 1799.74]  God, encounter
[1799.74 --> 1800.76]  us in new ways
[1800.76 --> 1801.46]  today as we
[1801.46 --> 1802.40]  partake in your
[1802.40 --> 1802.72]  supper.
[1804.52 --> 1805.32]  Empower us
[1805.32 --> 1806.14]  with your love
[1806.14 --> 1807.10]  that we may
[1807.10 --> 1807.80]  engage with
[1807.80 --> 1809.10]  others we
[1809.10 --> 1809.60]  never thought
[1809.60 --> 1810.12]  possible.
[1812.52 --> 1813.28]  Anoint us,
[1813.44 --> 1814.90]  Lord, that
[1814.90 --> 1815.52]  we may prepare
[1815.52 --> 1816.18]  a table in
[1816.18 --> 1816.76]  the presence of
[1816.76 --> 1817.48]  our enemies
[1817.48 --> 1820.88]  reconciled, so
[1820.88 --> 1821.60]  that we may be a
[1821.60 --> 1822.54]  testimony to your
[1822.54 --> 1823.62]  love, to your
[1823.62 --> 1824.54]  power to change
[1824.54 --> 1825.20]  hearts and
[1825.20 --> 1825.78]  wills.
[1827.62 --> 1828.14]  And journey
[1828.14 --> 1828.88]  with us, Lord,
[1828.98 --> 1829.72]  in the process.
[1830.38 --> 1831.14]  Keep filling us
[1831.14 --> 1832.82]  up when the gap
[1832.82 --> 1833.62]  is too wide.
[1834.62 --> 1835.40]  Fill us with your
[1835.40 --> 1837.58]  Spirit, that we may
[1837.58 --> 1838.58]  exude the fruits
[1838.58 --> 1839.44]  of your Spirit.
[1841.92 --> 1842.40]  Amen.
