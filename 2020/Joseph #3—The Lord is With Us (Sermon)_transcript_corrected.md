[0.00 → 13.06] So today we're going to continue our series of messages on the story of Joseph in the latter part of the Book of Genesis.
[15.56 → 19.76] And today we are going to read together Genesis 39.
[23.04 → 24.70] And this is the story.
[24.82 → 27.74] Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt.
[27.74 → 39.42] And the great Rotifer, an Egyptian who was one of Pharaoh's officials, the captain of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there.
[40.80 → 48.12] The Lord was with Joseph so that he prospered, and he lived in the house of his Egyptian master.
[48.12 → 58.52] When his master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord gave him success in everything he did, Joseph found favour in his eyes and became his attendant.
[59.32 → 66.36] Rotifer put him in charge of his household and he entrusted to his care everything he owned.
[66.36 → 75.30] From the time he put him in charge of his household and of all that he owned, the Lord blessed the household of the Egyptian because of Joseph.
[76.50 → 81.84] The blessing of the Lord was on everything Rotifer had, both in the house and in the field.
[82.56 → 85.62] So Rotifer left everything he had in Joseph's care.
[86.18 → 92.68] With Joseph in charge, he did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate.
[92.68 → 99.20] Now Joseph was well-built and handsome.
[100.86 → 105.42] And after a while, his master's wife took notice of Joseph and said,
[105.96 → 107.58] Come to bed with me.
[108.64 → 109.90] But he refused.
[111.16 → 116.16] With me in charge, he told her, my master does not concern himself with anything in the house.
[116.64 → 119.14] Everything he owns he has entrusted to my care.
[119.56 → 121.90] No one is greater in this house than I am.
[121.90 → 127.92] My master has withheld nothing from me except you because you are his wife.
[128.70 → 133.00] How then could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God?
[134.04 → 140.88] And though she spoke to Joseph day after day, he refused to go to bed with her or even be with her.
[142.18 → 148.24] One day he went into the house to attend to his duties and none of the household servants was inside.
[148.24 → 152.64] She caught him by his cloak and said, Come to bed with me.
[153.44 → 157.04] But he left his cloak in her hand and ran out of the house.
[157.44 → 163.34] When she saw that he had left his cloak in her hand and had run out of the house, she called her household servants.
[163.70 → 164.78] Look, she said to them.
[165.34 → 168.80] This Hebrew has been brought to us to make sport of us.
[168.80 → 171.82] He came in here to sleep with me, but I screamed.
[172.16 → 176.86] When he heard me scream for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.
[178.20 → 181.48] She kept his cloak beside her until his master came home.
[182.04 → 183.52] Then she told him this story.
[184.38 → 187.56] That Hebrew slave you brought us came to me to make sport of me.
[187.56 → 192.84] But as soon as I screamed for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.
[194.28 → 203.20] When his master heard the story his wife told him, saying, This is how your slave treated me, he burned with anger.
[204.70 → 210.36] Joseph's master took him and put him in prison, the place where the king's prisoners were confined.
[210.36 → 216.30] But while Joseph was there in the prison, the Lord was with him.
[217.34 → 221.96] He showed him kindness and granted him favour in the eyes of the prison warden.
[222.72 → 232.02] So the warden put Joseph in charge of all those held in the prison, and he was made responsible for all that was done there.
[232.74 → 240.14] The warden paid no attention to anything under Joseph's care because the Lord was with Joseph and gave him success.
[240.36 → 243.10] In whatever he did.
[243.76 → 245.76] This is the word of the Lord.
[247.62 → 252.76] A couple of weeks ago, you may remember, it's sort of an unforgettable story, isn't it?
[253.66 → 264.72] We read the story about Judah, Joseph's older brother, who casually slept with a woman he thought was a prostitute, but ended up being his daughter-in-law.
[267.02 → 269.42] Today you have a story of Joseph.
[270.36 → 277.96] Who steadfastly steers clear of what he knows to be a sinful sexual liaison.
[279.48 → 293.54] And so it seems after these two wild stories, we're all set for the Bible to give us some important moral lessons about God's gift of sexuality and how to avoid sexual temptation.
[293.54 → 302.86] Except, this is really only part of the story.
[303.38 → 307.88] And not contrary to what a lot of people think, the main part.
[307.88 → 315.04] There is a much bigger issue in Genesis 39 than sex.
[316.00 → 317.00] And it's this.
[317.00 → 336.18] How do you bridge the gap that sometimes, maybe often, exists between God's covenant promises and the painful things we often experience as his children in everyday life?
[336.18 → 342.10] On the one hand, the Bible clearly and everywhere teaches the truth of divine providence.
[342.90 → 352.02] On the other hand, the lives of God's people can be so painful, we may sometimes be tempted to give up on God.
[352.02 → 358.00] Leaving us with hard questions for which there are no easy answers.
[358.00 → 367.54] And that's where Genesis 39, in the largest story of God's people, is a case in point.
[367.54 → 373.58] I don't know if you noticed, but it is a story told between brackets.
[375.40 → 380.42] And the brackets are these words found in verse 2.
[381.54 → 388.28] And again, at the end of the chapter, twice no less, as though we needed some convincing, in verses 21 and 23.
[388.66 → 393.88] These words, the Lord was with Joseph.
[393.88 → 397.74] The Lord was with Joseph.
[398.84 → 407.12] Because of this divine presence in Joseph's life, as you would expect, all kinds of good things do happen to him.
[408.42 → 411.54] But this same story forces us to wonder,
[412.74 → 417.00] if God is the source of the good in Joseph's life,
[417.00 → 427.58] why doesn't, or why can't that same God prevent the evil thing that stands at this story's centre?
[428.78 → 433.14] How can it be true that the Lord is so intimately with Joseph?
[434.14 → 440.16] And that Joseph ends up being falsely accused and thrown into prison?
[440.16 → 446.24] It's one of the greatest difficulties, I think, of the Christian life.
[447.44 → 451.74] We celebrate the truth that God is with us, here at this table again this morning.
[452.74 → 455.60] It is an ancient tradition, and it was always mine,
[455.92 → 459.28] in the churches I served, to begin almost every worship service,
[459.28 → 461.62] with the blessing, the Lord be with you,
[461.84 → 465.28] and then the congregation would respond, and also with you.
[466.44 → 468.52] It is what we pray for our children,
[468.94 → 470.84] when they leave home on a date,
[472.62 → 473.52] a weekend trip,
[474.18 → 474.88] to college,
[476.16 → 477.20] overseas missions.
[478.20 → 479.30] But what happens
[479.30 → 482.20] when we pray for God to be with our kids,
[482.64 → 483.98] and a tragedy occurs?
[483.98 → 488.26] What happens when we pray for God to be with us at work,
[488.38 → 489.32] and we get laid off?
[490.44 → 491.28] What happens
[491.28 → 494.80] when we pray for God to bless our marriage,
[495.20 → 496.94] and in spite of all of our efforts,
[497.10 → 498.12] we end up divorced?
[499.66 → 502.00] What happens when we pray for God to be with us,
[502.02 → 503.70] when undergoing treatment for cancer,
[503.96 → 506.10] and the tumour doesn't stop growing?
[508.18 → 508.96] What then?
[510.10 → 510.50] Joseph?
[510.50 → 514.06] What about when you end up in prison,
[514.16 → 515.40] even though you were obedient,
[515.80 → 517.12] and you kept your integrity,
[517.58 → 520.64] even though you faced three of the strongest temptations,
[520.90 → 521.88] known to humans,
[522.32 → 522.82] no less,
[523.76 → 525.94] but remain faithful to God,
[526.28 → 527.24] in each of them?
[528.12 → 528.68] What then?
[531.88 → 536.00] Yes, Joseph faced three significant temptations,
[536.16 → 536.84] in the story.
[536.84 → 539.80] And while the third of these
[539.80 → 542.08] is the real issue of Genesis 39,
[543.02 → 544.94] and the second is the one
[544.94 → 545.60] that everyone,
[545.80 → 546.78] for obvious reasons,
[546.88 → 547.32] remembers,
[548.76 → 552.20] the first temptation Joseph faced
[552.20 → 555.48] was the temptation of power.
[556.88 → 559.50] In a few short but sweeping sentences,
[559.72 → 562.46] Genesis 39 describes how Joseph ends up
[562.46 → 565.10] in one of Egypt's most powerful households,
[565.10 → 567.32] the home of Rotifer,
[567.76 → 569.64] captain of Pharaoh's guard,
[570.36 → 572.76] and is soon promoted from captive slave
[572.76 → 574.84] to chief administrator
[574.84 → 577.76] over Rotifer's entire household.
[579.84 → 580.48] Power
[580.48 → 584.26] is perhaps the most seductive
[584.26 → 586.20] of all temptations.
[587.58 → 589.74] Not that it is wrong in itself,
[590.04 → 591.22] it is a gift of God
[591.22 → 592.70] meant to be used to serve
[592.70 → 594.02] and to bless others.
[595.10 → 596.62] It is what often comes
[596.62 → 598.36] along with power
[598.36 → 599.94] that is most seductive
[599.94 → 601.42] to kings and queens,
[601.86 → 603.24] presidents and prime ministers,
[603.70 → 605.50] everybody bowing and scraping,
[605.98 → 606.82] the limousines,
[606.96 → 608.06] the luxury suites,
[608.38 → 609.06] the servants,
[609.22 → 610.80] the aides that you beck and call,
[611.08 → 612.54] the ability to make war
[612.54 → 613.38] or peace,
[613.68 → 615.40] to hold the welfare of a nation
[615.40 → 616.20] in your hands,
[616.50 → 617.86] to have in some way
[617.86 → 619.58] the power of death
[619.58 → 620.46] and life
[620.46 → 621.72] over others.
[621.72 → 624.90] those
[624.90 → 626.78] are God's powers
[626.78 → 627.54] alone,
[627.70 → 628.26] of course.
[629.58 → 630.88] And in some way
[630.88 → 632.24] they always suffer
[632.24 → 634.22] when put into human hands,
[634.76 → 636.60] which is why God
[636.60 → 637.70] never wanted a king
[637.70 → 638.50] for Israel.
[639.98 → 641.64] God knew long before
[641.64 → 643.14] Lord Acton of Britain
[643.14 → 644.28] coined the phrase
[644.28 → 646.36] that power corrupts
[646.36 → 647.62] and absolute power
[647.62 → 648.98] corrupts absolutely.
[651.88 → 652.90] God knew
[652.90 → 654.34] that only one king
[654.34 → 656.88] never corrupts,
[657.88 → 659.08] God himself.
[660.42 → 661.20] And that even
[661.20 → 662.74] the best king Israel
[662.74 → 663.78] would ever get
[663.78 → 665.46] as far as earthly kings go,
[666.00 → 666.34] David,
[666.86 → 668.22] described twice in the Bible
[668.22 → 670.08] as a man after God's own heart,
[670.08 → 672.88] would prove to be nothing
[672.88 → 674.34] if not human,
[675.28 → 676.18] as in the case
[676.18 → 677.50] of his sexual assault
[677.50 → 678.36] of Bathsheba
[678.36 → 680.16] and the murder
[680.16 → 681.34] of her husband,
[681.76 → 683.10] Uriah the Hittite.
[685.30 → 686.38] But power
[686.38 → 687.58] not only corrupts,
[687.82 → 688.26] power
[688.26 → 689.48] also
[689.48 → 690.62] reveals.
[692.32 → 693.28] Sooner or later,
[693.48 → 694.68] people with power
[694.68 → 696.38] reveal their true
[696.38 → 697.38] character
[697.38 → 697.50] character
[697.50 → 698.96] and their ultimate
[698.96 → 699.52] goals
[699.52 → 700.84] and values.
[702.16 → 703.22] And never mind
[703.22 → 704.36] everything we could say
[704.36 → 705.60] here about politics
[705.60 → 706.50] today,
[706.74 → 707.42] either here
[707.42 → 708.62] or especially
[708.62 → 709.80] perhaps to the south
[709.80 → 710.74] of us these days.
[711.70 → 712.98] The truth is
[712.98 → 714.50] we all
[714.50 → 715.10] have
[715.10 → 715.90] our own
[715.90 → 716.88] little kingdoms
[716.88 → 718.36] where our word
[718.36 → 719.08] is final.
[719.64 → 720.48] From the office
[720.48 → 721.34] to the living room,
[721.84 → 722.48] the classroom
[722.48 → 723.26] to the company,
[723.90 → 724.58] to your money,
[724.86 → 725.42] right down
[725.42 → 726.14] to the TV
[726.14 → 727.04] remote control
[727.04 → 727.86] in our hands
[727.86 → 729.74] and where the way
[729.74 → 730.96] we use our power
[730.96 → 732.22] reveals
[732.22 → 734.16] what is in our souls.
[736.34 → 737.32] We read that
[737.32 → 738.68] the Lord was with Joseph
[738.68 → 740.84] and he prospered.
[741.86 → 742.58] Joseph, that is,
[742.64 → 743.14] became
[743.14 → 744.78] a powerful man
[744.78 → 747.24] who used the gift
[747.24 → 747.86] wisely
[747.86 → 748.60] and well
[748.60 → 750.48] and was used
[750.48 → 751.02] by God
[751.02 → 752.34] to bless Rotifer,
[752.64 → 753.22] the Egyptian,
[753.84 → 755.06] and his whole household.
[755.06 → 757.34] not as a missionary
[757.34 → 758.78] or some other form
[758.78 → 759.54] of what we sometimes
[759.54 → 760.30] refer to as
[760.30 → 761.16] full-time Christian
[761.16 → 762.08] service either,
[763.08 → 764.32] as though those
[764.32 → 765.30] are the only forms
[765.30 → 766.28] of full-time Christian
[766.28 → 766.74] service,
[767.32 → 768.88] but as a skilled
[768.88 → 769.88] administrator
[769.88 → 771.28] of Rotifer's
[771.28 → 772.18] extensive
[772.18 → 773.90] business interests.
[775.56 → 776.14] God's kingdom
[776.14 → 776.72] after all
[776.72 → 777.26] is much bigger
[777.26 → 777.84] than church.
[777.84 → 780.28] God's desire
[780.28 → 781.34] is that we
[781.34 → 782.30] bless others
[782.30 → 783.36] through the
[783.36 → 784.46] successful use
[784.46 → 785.30] of whatever
[785.30 → 787.04] power you and I
[787.04 → 788.28] have in our hands
[788.28 → 790.34] in whatever we do.
[791.34 → 792.56] You cannot help
[792.56 → 793.78] but hear the echo
[793.78 → 794.82] of God's promise
[794.82 → 795.46] to Abraham.
[796.46 → 797.50] I will bless you
[797.50 → 799.32] and all peoples
[799.32 → 799.88] on earth
[799.88 → 801.46] will be blessed
[801.46 → 802.68] through you.
[802.68 → 805.44] You cannot help
[805.44 → 806.10] but hear that
[806.10 → 807.08] promise in this
[807.08 → 807.64] description
[807.64 → 809.20] of Joseph's role
[809.20 → 810.06] in Rotifer's
[810.06 → 810.38] house.
[811.42 → 811.58] Listen,
[811.78 → 812.58] from the time
[812.58 → 813.76] Rotifer put
[813.76 → 814.68] Joseph in charge
[814.68 → 815.46] of his household
[815.46 → 816.22] and of all
[816.22 → 816.84] that he owned,
[817.18 → 817.52] the Lord
[817.52 → 818.48] blessed the
[818.48 → 819.04] household
[819.04 → 820.30] of the Egyptian
[820.30 → 822.26] because of
[822.26 → 822.66] Joseph.
[822.66 → 822.78] Joseph,
[823.68 → 825.72] it is a reminder
[825.72 → 826.86] that all of us
[826.86 → 828.96] have different
[828.96 → 830.00] vocations
[830.00 → 832.22] but we have
[832.22 → 833.44] the same calling
[833.44 → 834.66] in every one
[834.66 → 835.00] of them
[835.00 → 837.14] to use whatever
[837.14 → 838.66] power and success
[838.66 → 840.36] God gives you
[840.36 → 842.32] to bless others
[842.32 → 843.68] in your community
[843.68 → 845.20] and to bless
[845.20 → 845.74] the world.
[847.08 → 848.20] Your professional
[848.20 → 848.96] success
[848.96 → 850.34] in medicine
[850.34 → 851.30] or business
[851.30 → 852.30] or administration
[852.30 → 853.30] or education
[853.30 → 854.46] or politics
[854.46 → 855.12] or law
[855.12 → 856.00] or agriculture
[856.00 → 857.22] or any other
[857.22 → 857.88] field you might
[857.88 → 858.18] name.
[859.34 → 860.02] The money
[860.02 → 860.92] and the prosperity
[860.92 → 861.96] you may have
[861.96 → 863.14] as a result
[863.14 → 864.58] is all a gift
[864.58 → 865.32] of God.
[866.46 → 867.62] God gave it
[867.62 → 868.16] to you
[868.16 → 870.04] as God gave
[870.04 → 870.82] it to Joseph
[870.82 → 872.20] and with the
[872.20 → 872.84] same purpose
[872.84 → 874.36] to extend
[874.36 → 875.38] God's blessing
[875.38 → 877.04] to his world
[877.04 → 878.38] through you.
[879.70 → 880.76] In a world
[880.76 → 881.10] where the
[881.10 → 881.66] temptation
[881.66 → 882.70] or the misuse
[882.70 → 883.30] and abuse
[883.30 → 883.82] of power
[883.82 → 884.90] is so seductive
[884.90 → 885.52] and strong
[885.52 → 887.06] we need to
[887.06 → 887.86] look at ourselves
[887.86 → 888.62] in the mirror
[888.62 → 889.44] every morning
[889.44 → 890.14] and say to
[890.14 → 890.56] ourselves
[890.56 → 891.82] God has
[891.82 → 892.42] blessed me
[892.42 → 893.56] with this
[893.56 → 894.62] particular power
[894.62 → 895.32] with this
[895.32 → 896.46] particular success
[896.46 → 897.50] God has
[897.50 → 898.22] put me where
[898.22 → 898.70] I am
[898.70 → 899.96] and then ask
[899.96 → 902.12] show me how
[902.12 → 902.44] Lord
[902.44 → 904.08] and use me
[904.08 → 904.72] to bless
[904.72 → 905.86] others around
[905.86 → 906.36] me
[906.36 → 907.38] today.
[907.38 → 909.76] do that
[909.76 → 910.36] as Joseph
[910.36 → 910.72] did
[910.72 → 911.70] and you
[911.70 → 912.14] have a
[912.14 → 912.62] powerful
[912.62 → 913.76] driving force
[913.76 → 914.86] for doing
[914.86 → 915.46] good in
[915.46 → 916.04] your life
[916.04 → 916.96] and a
[916.96 → 917.52] powerful
[917.52 → 918.30] antidote
[918.30 → 918.98] to the
[918.98 → 919.72] corruptions
[919.72 → 921.06] and temptations
[921.06 → 921.90] of power.
[921.90 → 925.56] all right
[925.56 → 925.82] now
[925.82 → 927.02] that brings us
[927.02 → 927.32] to the
[927.32 → 927.80] temptation
[927.80 → 928.42] that appears
[928.42 → 928.92] to be at
[928.92 → 929.58] the centre
[929.58 → 929.96] of this
[929.96 → 930.30] story
[930.30 → 931.96] the temptation
[931.96 → 932.74] for lack
[932.74 → 933.20] of a better
[933.20 → 933.96] way of putting
[933.96 → 934.20] it
[934.20 → 935.36] of illicit
[935.36 → 935.86] sex
[935.86 → 937.46] although
[937.46 → 938.74] sexual matters
[938.74 → 939.66] are also
[939.66 → 941.04] so often
[941.04 → 942.44] about power
[942.44 → 944.90] for as
[944.90 → 945.56] successful
[945.56 → 946.58] and trusted
[946.58 → 947.42] and administrator
[947.42 → 948.40] as Joseph
[948.40 → 949.18] had become
[949.18 → 950.52] he was
[950.52 → 950.92] still a
[950.92 → 951.22] slave
[951.22 → 952.98] and in
[952.98 → 953.70] slave cultures
[953.70 → 954.26] both then
[954.26 → 954.92] and now
[954.92 → 956.84] sex is an
[956.84 → 957.82] often hidden
[957.82 → 958.68] but important
[958.68 → 959.88] part of the
[959.88 → 960.54] relationship
[960.54 → 961.86] slave owners
[961.86 → 963.14] often exercise
[963.14 → 964.18] their ownership
[964.18 → 965.82] through sexual
[965.82 → 966.36] advances
[966.36 → 967.64] harassment
[967.64 → 968.88] and rape
[968.88 → 971.56] even today
[971.56 → 972.10] so many
[972.10 → 972.62] power
[972.62 → 973.30] relationships
[973.30 → 975.14] can be
[975.14 → 975.66] sexually
[975.66 → 976.40] charged
[976.40 → 978.22] employers
[978.22 → 979.74] supervisors
[979.74 → 981.00] teachers
[981.00 → 982.24] priests
[982.24 → 983.44] pastors
[983.44 → 984.60] parents
[984.60 → 985.82] presidents
[985.82 → 986.84] can
[986.84 → 987.72] and sometimes
[987.72 → 988.08] do
[988.08 → 988.98] exploit
[988.98 → 989.70] their power
[989.70 → 990.52] over others
[990.52 → 992.18] in sexual
[992.18 → 992.66] ways
[992.66 → 995.00] in such
[995.00 → 995.62] relationships
[995.62 → 996.92] there's really
[996.92 → 997.74] no such thing
[997.74 → 998.68] as consent
[998.68 → 999.34] of course
[999.34 → 1000.86] but only
[1000.86 → 1001.68] constraint
[1001.68 → 1003.02] or compulsion
[1003.02 → 1004.66] however subtle
[1004.66 → 1005.66] that may be
[1005.66 → 1007.62] and just
[1007.62 → 1008.54] so you
[1008.54 → 1008.88] know
[1008.88 → 1009.80] by law
[1009.80 → 1010.90] and within
[1010.90 → 1011.96] our denomination
[1011.96 → 1012.88] when it comes
[1012.88 → 1013.46] to church
[1013.46 → 1014.08] leaders
[1014.08 → 1015.62] any person
[1015.62 → 1016.66] in authority
[1016.66 → 1017.86] who engages
[1017.86 → 1018.86] in a sexual
[1018.86 → 1019.54] relationship
[1019.54 → 1020.58] with someone
[1020.58 → 1021.52] under his
[1021.52 → 1022.02] or her
[1022.02 → 1022.70] authority
[1022.70 → 1023.90] even if the
[1023.90 → 1024.74] victim is not
[1024.74 → 1025.30] a minor
[1025.30 → 1026.78] is guilty
[1026.78 → 1028.42] of sexual
[1028.42 → 1029.36] abuse
[1029.36 → 1030.94] and rightly
[1030.94 → 1031.34] so
[1031.34 → 1034.38] Rotifer's
[1034.38 → 1034.76] wife
[1034.76 → 1036.10] is a
[1036.10 → 1036.78] sex abuser
[1036.78 → 1038.82] to set up
[1038.82 → 1039.32] the scene
[1039.32 → 1040.02] we are told
[1040.02 → 1040.82] that on top
[1040.82 → 1041.34] of everything
[1041.34 → 1041.68] else
[1041.68 → 1042.70] Joseph was
[1042.70 → 1043.68] well-built
[1043.68 → 1045.36] and handsome
[1045.36 → 1047.58] and wherever
[1047.58 → 1048.26] this woman
[1048.26 → 1049.00] with far
[1049.00 → 1049.44] too much
[1049.44 → 1049.92] time
[1049.92 → 1050.94] and too
[1050.94 → 1051.74] little husband
[1051.74 → 1052.64] on her hands
[1052.64 → 1053.58] turns in her
[1053.58 → 1054.14] household
[1054.14 → 1055.94] Joseph is
[1055.94 → 1056.26] there
[1056.26 → 1057.58] intelligent
[1057.58 → 1059.46] good-looking
[1059.46 → 1061.22] well-built
[1061.22 → 1062.08] Joseph
[1062.08 → 1062.86] apparently
[1062.86 → 1064.14] was hot
[1064.14 → 1066.98] and he
[1066.98 → 1067.76] belongs to her
[1067.76 → 1068.38] after all
[1068.38 → 1070.00] he's a slave
[1070.00 → 1071.38] she owns him
[1071.38 → 1073.88] so one day
[1073.88 → 1074.46] and obviously
[1074.46 → 1074.92] not one
[1074.92 → 1075.54] for a lot
[1075.54 → 1076.40] of preliminaries
[1076.40 → 1077.64] she confronts
[1077.64 → 1077.94] Joseph
[1077.94 → 1078.64] and according
[1078.64 → 1079.40] to the original
[1079.40 → 1079.78] Hebrew
[1079.78 → 1080.52] demands
[1080.52 → 1081.68] sex
[1081.68 → 1082.54] now
[1082.54 → 1084.54] that's
[1084.54 → 1085.48] the sanitized
[1085.48 → 1085.86] version
[1085.86 → 1086.84] for churches
[1086.84 → 1090.00] but Joseph
[1090.00 → 1090.60] has a good
[1090.60 → 1090.88] head
[1090.88 → 1091.32] on his
[1091.32 → 1091.64] broad
[1091.64 → 1092.04] shoulders
[1092.04 → 1092.42] and a
[1092.42 → 1092.78] commitment
[1092.78 → 1093.30] to God
[1093.30 → 1093.62] in his
[1093.62 → 1093.92] heart
[1093.92 → 1094.26] and he
[1094.26 → 1094.74] refuses
[1094.74 → 1096.60] he gives
[1096.60 → 1096.94] her a
[1096.94 → 1097.38] reasoned
[1097.38 → 1097.86] defence
[1097.86 → 1099.90] he explains
[1099.90 → 1100.50] the trust
[1100.50 → 1101.14] Rotifer
[1101.14 → 1101.72] has placed
[1101.72 → 1102.16] in him
[1102.16 → 1103.70] the betrayal
[1103.70 → 1104.34] this liaison
[1104.34 → 1105.02] would be
[1105.02 → 1106.72] and maybe
[1106.72 → 1107.24] she could
[1107.24 → 1107.96] understand
[1107.96 → 1108.64] that
[1108.64 → 1109.40] but that
[1109.40 → 1109.72] is not
[1109.72 → 1110.12] the heart
[1110.12 → 1110.40] of his
[1110.40 → 1110.90] refusal
[1110.90 → 1111.84] the heart
[1111.84 → 1112.14] of his
[1112.14 → 1112.62] refusal
[1112.62 → 1113.38] is this
[1113.38 → 1115.10] how then
[1115.10 → 1115.64] could I
[1115.64 → 1116.16] do such
[1116.16 → 1116.72] a wicked
[1116.72 → 1117.24] thing
[1117.24 → 1118.90] and sin
[1118.90 → 1120.20] against
[1120.20 → 1121.06] God
[1121.06 → 1123.78] but still
[1123.78 → 1124.34] she's after
[1124.34 → 1124.54] him
[1124.54 → 1125.02] day after
[1125.02 → 1125.30] day
[1125.30 → 1125.80] we read
[1125.80 → 1126.16] and day
[1126.16 → 1126.66] after day
[1126.66 → 1127.34] he refuses
[1127.34 → 1127.98] making sure
[1127.98 → 1128.52] he was never
[1128.52 → 1129.28] again alone
[1129.28 → 1129.66] with her
[1129.66 → 1130.64] in the
[1130.64 → 1130.98] house
[1130.98 → 1131.94] until one
[1131.94 → 1132.28] day he
[1132.28 → 1132.94] came home
[1132.94 → 1133.42] and found
[1133.42 → 1133.84] the house
[1133.84 → 1134.96] oddly quiet
[1134.96 → 1136.02] with no one
[1136.02 → 1136.72] there except
[1136.72 → 1137.48] Mrs. P
[1137.48 → 1138.50] who nearly
[1138.50 → 1139.24] naked this
[1139.24 → 1139.58] time
[1139.58 → 1140.50] grabs him
[1140.50 → 1140.88] by his
[1140.88 → 1141.16] cloak
[1141.16 → 1141.88] demands
[1141.88 → 1142.32] sex
[1142.32 → 1142.88] then
[1142.88 → 1143.60] and there
[1143.60 → 1144.20] and this
[1144.20 → 1144.52] time
[1144.52 → 1145.12] there are
[1145.12 → 1145.76] no speeches
[1145.76 → 1147.64] Joseph
[1147.64 → 1148.56] knew
[1148.56 → 1149.92] just knew
[1149.92 → 1150.90] there was
[1150.90 → 1151.80] no reasoning
[1151.80 → 1152.72] out of
[1152.72 → 1153.64] this situation
[1153.64 → 1155.10] and so
[1155.10 → 1155.52] Joseph
[1155.52 → 1156.10] flees the
[1156.10 → 1156.46] house
[1156.46 → 1158.02] so fast
[1158.02 → 1159.26] that once
[1159.26 → 1159.60] again
[1159.60 → 1160.58] he is left
[1160.58 → 1161.22] without
[1161.22 → 1162.10] his clothes
[1162.10 → 1164.36] first it
[1164.36 → 1164.70] was his
[1164.70 → 1164.98] brother
[1164.98 → 1165.94] stripping him
[1165.94 → 1166.54] of his
[1166.54 → 1166.92] coat of
[1166.92 → 1167.54] many colours
[1167.54 → 1168.50] dipping it
[1168.50 → 1169.00] in goat's
[1169.00 → 1169.22] blood
[1169.22 → 1170.12] to fake
[1170.12 → 1170.62] his death
[1170.62 → 1172.04] now it
[1172.04 → 1172.38] is the
[1172.38 → 1172.80] angry
[1172.80 → 1173.76] and humiliated
[1173.76 → 1174.24] wife
[1174.24 → 1175.76] of Rotifer
[1175.76 → 1177.26] who has
[1177.26 → 1177.88] stripped him
[1177.88 → 1179.08] while she
[1179.08 → 1179.54] cries
[1179.54 → 1180.18] rape
[1180.18 → 1181.68] with pretty
[1181.68 → 1182.06] much
[1182.06 → 1183.08] the same
[1183.08 → 1183.54] result
[1183.54 → 1184.84] Joseph
[1184.84 → 1185.68] ends up
[1185.68 → 1186.38] in prison
[1186.38 → 1187.76] as good
[1187.76 → 1188.18] as dead
[1188.18 → 1190.98] we are
[1190.98 → 1191.00] we are
[1191.00 → 1191.54] not told
[1191.54 → 1192.88] if Rotifer
[1192.88 → 1193.38] really
[1193.38 → 1194.18] believes
[1194.18 → 1194.74] her story
[1194.74 → 1196.52] interestingly
[1196.52 → 1197.12] it says
[1197.12 → 1197.44] that he
[1197.44 → 1197.80] burned
[1197.80 → 1197.98] with
[1197.98 → 1198.34] anger
[1198.34 → 1200.54] it does
[1200.54 → 1201.20] not say
[1201.20 → 1202.32] who he's
[1202.32 → 1202.62] angry
[1202.62 → 1203.02] with
[1203.02 → 1204.92] nor does
[1204.92 → 1205.36] he punishes
[1205.36 → 1205.74] Joseph
[1205.74 → 1206.28] as you
[1206.28 → 1206.64] would have
[1206.64 → 1207.12] expected
[1207.12 → 1208.66] with death
[1208.66 → 1210.48] whatever
[1210.48 → 1211.10] he thinks
[1211.10 → 1211.68] really
[1211.68 → 1212.16] happened
[1212.16 → 1212.78] the end
[1212.78 → 1213.20] result
[1213.20 → 1214.24] for
[1214.24 → 1214.60] Joseph
[1214.60 → 1215.58] is the
[1215.58 → 1215.90] same
[1215.90 → 1217.56] prison
[1217.56 → 1220.56] to the
[1220.56 → 1220.80] world
[1220.80 → 1221.28] of course
[1221.28 → 1222.22] this whole
[1222.22 → 1222.62] thing
[1222.62 → 1223.62] is a
[1223.62 → 1223.88] joke
[1223.88 → 1225.92] in our
[1225.92 → 1226.32] time
[1226.32 → 1226.68] in which
[1226.68 → 1227.26] adultery
[1227.26 → 1227.52] is
[1227.52 → 1228.14] entertainment
[1228.14 → 1229.02] and lust
[1229.02 → 1229.78] is constantly
[1229.78 → 1230.84] being advertised
[1230.84 → 1231.68] sex sells
[1231.68 → 1232.08] everybody
[1232.08 → 1232.66] knows
[1232.66 → 1233.56] Joseph
[1233.56 → 1234.28] isn't only
[1234.28 → 1235.06] regarded as
[1235.06 → 1235.68] a joke
[1235.68 → 1237.08] but as
[1237.08 → 1237.70] abnormal
[1237.70 → 1239.34] one
[1239.34 → 1239.84] psychologist
[1239.84 → 1240.58] claims that
[1240.58 → 1240.88] Joseph
[1240.88 → 1241.58] was sexually
[1241.58 → 1242.06] abnormal
[1242.06 → 1242.78] due to
[1242.78 → 1242.94] his
[1242.94 → 1243.32] intimate
[1243.32 → 1243.72] love
[1243.72 → 1244.28] for his
[1244.28 → 1244.70] father
[1244.70 → 1248.26] but then
[1248.26 → 1248.72] how can
[1248.72 → 1249.38] you expect
[1249.38 → 1250.98] the people
[1250.98 → 1251.54] of this
[1251.54 → 1251.86] world
[1251.86 → 1253.02] to understand
[1253.02 → 1258.16] to understand
[1258.16 → 1258.78] Joseph
[1258.78 → 1260.16] if they
[1260.16 → 1260.58] do not
[1260.58 → 1260.98] know
[1260.98 → 1261.92] Joseph's
[1261.92 → 1262.24] God
[1262.24 → 1263.94] how
[1263.94 → 1264.24] then
[1264.24 → 1264.66] could I
[1264.66 → 1265.12] do such
[1265.12 → 1265.60] a wicked
[1265.60 → 1266.08] thing
[1266.08 → 1266.86] and sin
[1266.86 → 1267.54] against
[1267.54 → 1268.54] God
[1268.54 → 1270.30] Joseph
[1270.30 → 1270.92] is willing
[1270.92 → 1271.48] to lose
[1271.48 → 1272.02] both his
[1272.02 → 1272.48] cloak
[1272.48 → 1274.34] and his
[1274.34 → 1274.94] dignity
[1274.94 → 1276.52] as long
[1276.52 → 1276.96] as he
[1276.96 → 1277.46] can keep
[1277.46 → 1278.06] faith
[1278.06 → 1279.32] with God
[1279.32 → 1282.08] and what
[1282.08 → 1282.60] about us
[1282.60 → 1284.22] God
[1284.22 → 1284.88] calls us
[1284.88 → 1285.36] to out
[1285.36 → 1285.60] of the
[1285.60 → 1286.00] land of
[1286.00 → 1286.30] Egypt
[1286.30 → 1286.66] out of
[1286.66 → 1287.02] the house
[1287.02 → 1287.78] of Rotifer's
[1287.78 → 1288.10] wife
[1288.10 → 1288.70] out of
[1288.70 → 1289.14] the world
[1289.14 → 1289.84] covenant
[1289.84 → 1290.28] people
[1290.28 → 1290.92] from Abraham
[1290.92 → 1291.56] to Joseph
[1291.56 → 1291.98] to the
[1291.98 → 1292.38] disciples
[1292.38 → 1292.94] of Jesus
[1292.94 → 1293.58] then and
[1293.58 → 1293.98] now
[1293.98 → 1295.18] are holy
[1295.18 → 1295.98] set
[1295.98 → 1296.60] apart
[1296.60 → 1297.24] people
[1297.24 → 1298.98] in so
[1298.98 → 1299.58] many ways
[1299.58 → 1300.04] a Christian
[1300.04 → 1300.46] in the
[1300.46 → 1300.76] world
[1300.76 → 1301.38] is like
[1301.38 → 1301.84] a Christian
[1301.84 → 1302.20] at a
[1302.20 → 1302.48] party
[1302.48 → 1302.86] which has
[1302.86 → 1303.36] taken a
[1303.36 → 1303.94] very ugly
[1303.94 → 1304.36] turn
[1304.36 → 1305.08] there is a
[1305.08 → 1305.44] time
[1305.44 → 1306.10] when you
[1306.10 → 1306.72] may just
[1306.72 → 1307.20] feel like
[1307.20 → 1307.48] you just
[1307.48 → 1307.80] got to
[1307.80 → 1308.26] get up
[1308.26 → 1308.76] and get
[1308.76 → 1309.06] out
[1309.06 → 1310.46] you don't
[1310.46 → 1310.84] belong
[1310.84 → 1311.20] there
[1311.20 → 1314.20] and when
[1314.20 → 1314.72] it comes
[1314.72 → 1315.44] to God's
[1315.44 → 1316.02] will for
[1316.02 → 1316.66] sexuality
[1316.66 → 1317.30] and yes
[1317.30 → 1317.82] I know
[1317.82 → 1318.36] we mess
[1318.36 → 1318.64] up
[1318.64 → 1319.60] and yes
[1319.60 → 1320.12] there is
[1320.12 → 1320.56] forgiveness
[1320.56 → 1321.14] okay
[1321.14 → 1322.66] but
[1322.66 → 1324.26] God's
[1324.26 → 1324.66] will
[1324.66 → 1325.52] for
[1325.52 → 1326.12] sexuality
[1326.12 → 1326.74] is about
[1326.74 → 1327.48] as simple
[1327.48 → 1327.78] and
[1327.78 → 1328.26] straightforward
[1328.26 → 1329.24] as can
[1329.24 → 1329.62] be
[1329.62 → 1331.14] sex
[1331.14 → 1331.62] is for
[1331.62 → 1332.10] marriage
[1332.10 → 1333.68] and marriage
[1333.68 → 1334.54] is for
[1334.54 → 1334.90] life
[1334.90 → 1336.84] which means
[1336.84 → 1337.20] that the
[1337.20 → 1338.10] most significant
[1338.10 → 1338.84] question
[1338.84 → 1339.60] for us
[1339.60 → 1339.94] in a
[1339.94 → 1340.24] culture
[1340.24 → 1340.70] that no
[1340.70 → 1341.04] longer
[1341.04 → 1341.78] recognizes
[1341.78 → 1342.42] those
[1342.42 → 1342.72] sorts
[1342.72 → 1342.88] of
[1342.88 → 1343.30] boundaries
[1343.30 → 1345.02] is not
[1345.02 → 1345.84] what is
[1345.84 → 1346.20] right and
[1346.20 → 1346.44] what is
[1346.44 → 1346.72] wrong
[1346.72 → 1347.60] but
[1347.60 → 1349.08] what is
[1349.08 → 1349.76] it that
[1349.76 → 1350.56] we fear
[1350.56 → 1351.36] most
[1351.36 → 1353.62] that we
[1353.62 → 1354.28] might sin
[1354.28 → 1355.08] against our
[1355.08 → 1356.02] faithful covenant
[1356.02 → 1356.72] God
[1356.72 → 1357.78] by our
[1357.78 → 1358.70] disobedience
[1358.70 → 1359.90] or
[1359.90 → 1361.18] that we
[1361.18 → 1361.58] might be
[1361.58 → 1362.38] ridiculed
[1362.38 → 1363.46] by a
[1363.46 → 1363.96] world that
[1363.96 → 1364.38] does not
[1364.38 → 1364.98] know him
[1364.98 → 1366.72] for our
[1366.72 → 1367.68] obedience
[1367.68 → 1367.94] obedience
[1367.94 → 1372.12] meanwhile
[1372.12 → 1372.72] the people
[1372.72 → 1373.04] of our
[1373.04 → 1373.42] world have
[1373.42 → 1374.06] another reason
[1374.06 → 1375.12] to laugh
[1375.12 → 1375.58] at Joseph
[1375.58 → 1376.26] because his
[1376.26 → 1377.18] obedience lands
[1377.18 → 1377.80] him in prison
[1377.80 → 1379.14] and that
[1379.14 → 1379.78] brings us to
[1379.78 → 1380.36] the biggest
[1380.36 → 1380.88] issue
[1380.88 → 1382.00] of Genesis
[1382.00 → 1383.20] to the
[1383.20 → 1383.74] providence
[1383.74 → 1384.28] question
[1384.28 → 1385.66] and to
[1385.66 → 1386.22] Joseph's
[1386.22 → 1386.84] third and
[1386.84 → 1387.48] perhaps
[1387.48 → 1388.66] most difficult
[1388.66 → 1389.32] temptation
[1389.32 → 1390.18] the
[1390.18 → 1390.84] temptation
[1390.84 → 1391.90] to
[1391.90 → 1393.06] despair
[1393.06 → 1395.28] the
[1395.28 → 1395.74] Lord was
[1395.74 → 1395.98] with
[1395.98 → 1396.40] Joseph
[1396.40 → 1397.18] it
[1397.18 → 1397.60] says so
[1397.60 → 1398.04] no less
[1398.04 → 1398.20] than
[1398.20 → 1398.40] three
[1398.40 → 1398.86] times
[1398.86 → 1400.38] yet
[1400.38 → 1400.74] Joseph
[1400.74 → 1401.18] ends up
[1401.18 → 1401.60] falsely
[1401.60 → 1402.12] accused
[1402.12 → 1402.82] and in
[1402.82 → 1403.10] prison
[1403.10 → 1403.90] and what
[1403.90 → 1404.34] kind
[1404.34 → 1404.62] of
[1404.62 → 1405.20] providence
[1405.20 → 1406.14] is that
[1406.14 → 1408.26] if you
[1408.26 → 1408.58] do the
[1408.58 → 1408.94] right thing
[1408.94 → 1409.46] for God
[1409.46 → 1410.74] God
[1410.74 → 1411.14] should do
[1411.14 → 1411.52] the right
[1411.52 → 1411.74] thing
[1411.74 → 1412.28] for you
[1412.28 → 1412.68] right
[1412.68 → 1414.58] if you
[1414.58 → 1415.22] mess up
[1415.22 → 1416.00] like
[1416.00 → 1416.58] Rotifer's
[1416.58 → 1416.94] wife
[1416.94 → 1418.06] then God
[1418.06 → 1418.64] should punish
[1418.64 → 1419.08] you and
[1419.08 → 1419.62] you deserve
[1419.62 → 1420.02] it
[1420.02 → 1422.16] that's
[1422.16 → 1422.80] the popular
[1422.80 → 1423.50] simplistic
[1423.50 → 1424.14] idea
[1424.14 → 1425.24] of
[1425.24 → 1425.86] providence
[1425.86 → 1426.38] that's
[1426.38 → 1426.56] the
[1426.56 → 1427.06] heart
[1427.06 → 1427.44] of the
[1427.44 → 1427.76] health
[1427.76 → 1428.62] and wealth
[1428.62 → 1429.32] gospel
[1429.32 → 1429.84] promoted
[1429.84 → 1430.36] by so
[1430.36 → 1430.64] many
[1430.64 → 1431.20] evangelical
[1431.20 → 1431.72] Christians
[1431.72 → 1432.16] in North
[1432.16 → 1432.56] America
[1432.56 → 1433.00] today
[1433.00 → 1434.72] but that's
[1434.72 → 1435.00] not how
[1435.00 → 1435.42] it works
[1435.42 → 1435.70] here
[1435.70 → 1438.00] and is
[1438.00 → 1438.36] it is hard
[1438.36 → 1438.96] to imagine
[1438.96 → 1439.42] that there
[1439.42 → 1439.86] must have
[1439.86 → 1440.06] been
[1440.06 → 1440.98] so many
[1440.98 → 1441.38] times
[1441.38 → 1441.88] in prison
[1441.88 → 1442.16] that
[1442.16 → 1442.52] Joseph
[1442.52 → 1443.04] wondered
[1443.04 → 1443.66] where
[1443.66 → 1444.32] is
[1444.32 → 1444.98] God
[1444.98 → 1447.54] what's
[1447.54 → 1447.90] happened
[1447.90 → 1448.44] to my
[1448.44 → 1448.92] dreams
[1448.92 → 1450.68] what
[1450.68 → 1450.98] good
[1450.98 → 1451.36] did it
[1451.36 → 1452.06] do me
[1452.06 → 1452.70] to stand
[1452.70 → 1452.92] up
[1452.92 → 1453.32] for my
[1453.32 → 1453.94] integrity
[1453.94 → 1457.36] the
[1457.36 → 1457.90] temptation
[1457.90 → 1458.18] to
[1458.18 → 1458.64] despair
[1458.64 → 1458.94] is to
[1458.94 → 1459.12] come
[1459.12 → 1459.28] to
[1459.28 → 1459.72] believe
[1459.72 → 1460.58] that
[1460.58 → 1460.88] God
[1460.88 → 1461.20] isn't
[1461.20 → 1461.52] really
[1461.52 → 1461.92] God
[1461.92 → 1462.14] that
[1462.14 → 1462.68] there
[1462.68 → 1462.92] is
[1462.92 → 1463.42] ultimately
[1463.42 → 1463.94] no
[1463.94 → 1464.36] justice
[1464.36 → 1464.70] in the
[1464.70 → 1464.98] world
[1464.98 → 1467.28] let's
[1467.28 → 1467.56] face
[1467.56 → 1467.80] it
[1467.80 → 1468.98] lies
[1468.98 → 1470.80] power
[1470.80 → 1472.64] lust
[1472.64 → 1473.60] often
[1473.60 → 1474.04] work out
[1474.04 → 1474.74] just fine
[1474.74 → 1475.24] in the
[1475.24 → 1475.68] empires
[1475.68 → 1476.20] of Egypt
[1476.20 → 1476.70] and of
[1476.70 → 1476.88] this
[1476.88 → 1477.22] world
[1477.22 → 1479.28] do I
[1479.28 → 1479.48] really
[1479.48 → 1479.70] need
[1479.70 → 1479.82] to
[1479.82 → 1480.00] name
[1480.00 → 1480.36] names
[1480.36 → 1482.66] how
[1482.66 → 1482.98] often
[1482.98 → 1483.34] didn't
[1483.34 → 1483.74] psalmist
[1483.74 → 1484.32] complain
[1484.32 → 1485.14] about
[1485.14 → 1485.46] just
[1485.46 → 1485.74] this
[1485.74 → 1486.10] matter
[1486.10 → 1487.82] listen
[1487.82 → 1488.40] this is
[1488.40 → 1488.68] what the
[1488.68 → 1488.90] wicked
[1488.90 → 1489.34] are like
[1489.34 → 1489.94] asap
[1489.94 → 1490.80] psalm 73
[1490.80 → 1491.66] always
[1491.66 → 1492.22] carefree

[1493.76 → 1494.10] in
[1494.10 → 1494.40] vain
[1494.40 → 1494.62] have
[1494.62 → 1494.76] I
[1494.76 → 1494.94] kept
[1494.94 → 1495.18] my
[1495.18 → 1495.44] heart
[1495.44 → 1495.78] pure

[1497.94 → 1498.46] in
[1498.46 → 1498.92] innocent
[1498.92 → 1501.96] but
[1501.96 → 1502.14] the
[1502.14 → 1502.46] claim
[1502.46 → 1502.90] of this
[1502.90 → 1503.40] story
[1503.40 → 1504.04] is not
[1504.04 → 1504.34] that
[1504.34 → 1504.80] everything
[1504.80 → 1505.08] will
[1505.08 → 1505.38] work
[1505.38 → 1505.58] out
[1505.58 → 1505.94] how
[1505.94 → 1506.16] and
[1506.16 → 1506.40] when
[1506.40 → 1506.62] we
[1506.62 → 1506.94] think
[1506.94 → 1507.14] it
[1507.14 → 1507.50] should
[1507.50 → 1508.46] or
[1508.46 → 1508.70] that
[1508.70 → 1508.94] we
[1508.94 → 1509.16] will
[1509.16 → 1509.34] be
[1509.34 → 1509.62] saved
[1509.62 → 1509.80] from
[1509.80 → 1510.16] every
[1510.16 → 1510.56] trouble
[1510.56 → 1512.02] or
[1512.02 → 1512.20] that
[1512.20 → 1512.38] the
[1512.38 → 1512.60] wicked
[1512.60 → 1512.82] will
[1512.82 → 1513.30] always
[1513.30 → 1513.54] get
[1513.54 → 1513.72] their
[1513.72 → 1514.00] just

[1515.42 → 1516.84] no
[1516.84 → 1519.06] God's
[1519.06 → 1519.34] goodness
[1519.34 → 1519.72] to the
[1519.72 → 1520.10] faithful
[1520.10 → 1521.20] is
[1521.20 → 1521.46] very
[1521.46 → 1521.84] real
[1521.84 → 1523.28] but
[1523.28 → 1523.50] it
[1523.50 → 1523.70] is

[1537.18 → 1537.44] as
[1537.44 → 1537.74] Paul
[1537.74 → 1538.02] wrote

[1538.56 → 1538.82] in
[1538.82 → 1539.10] Rome
[1539.10 → 1539.84] that
[1539.84 → 1540.00] we
[1540.00 → 1540.16] will
[1540.16 → 1540.40] not

[1561.54 → 1561.82] with
[1561.82 → 1562.24] Joseph
[1562.24 → 1562.52] that
[1562.52 → 1562.86] God
[1562.86 → 1563.02] is
[1563.02 → 1563.22] on
[1563.22 → 1563.80] Joseph's
[1563.80 → 1564.20] side
[1564.20 → 1565.84] the

[1566.22 → 1566.34] of
[1566.34 → 1566.48] the
[1566.48 → 1566.88] promise

[1569.50 → 1569.82] evil
[1569.82 → 1570.34] befalls
[1570.34 → 1570.64] him
[1570.64 → 1571.28] only
[1571.28 → 1571.54] in
[1571.54 → 1572.06] retrospect
[1572.06 → 1572.34] and

[1572.54 → 1572.80] years
[1572.80 → 1573.10] later

[1573.82 → 1574.04] already
[1574.04 → 1574.44] know

[1578.62 → 1578.80] the
[1578.80 → 1579.00] good
[1579.00 → 1579.40] things
[1579.40 → 1579.58] that
[1579.58 → 1579.94] God
[1579.94 → 1580.30] brought
[1580.30 → 1580.60] out
[1580.60 → 1580.76] of
[1580.76 → 1581.12] every
[1581.12 → 1581.48] evil
[1581.48 → 1581.66] he
[1581.66 → 1582.26] experienced
[1582.26 → 1582.86] including
[1582.86 → 1583.18] being
[1583.18 → 1583.68] sold
[1583.68 → 1584.12] as
[1584.12 → 1584.28] a
[1584.28 → 1584.60] slave
[1584.60 → 1584.82] and
[1584.82 → 1585.30] falsely
[1585.30 → 1586.10] convicted
[1586.10 → 1586.42] of
[1586.42 → 1586.84] attempted
[1586.84 → 1587.36] rape
[1587.36 → 1588.92] but
[1588.92 → 1589.08] it
[1589.08 → 1589.28] does
[1589.28 → 1589.64] not
[1589.64 → 1589.94] mean

[1592.64 → 1592.92] all
[1592.92 → 1593.06] of

[1595.08 → 1595.46] of
[1595.46 → 1595.86] God's
[1595.86 → 1596.50] providence
[1596.50 → 1598.04] sometimes
[1598.04 → 1598.94] you hear
[1598.94 → 1599.52] people say
[1599.52 → 1599.82] that
[1599.82 → 1601.04] God
[1601.04 → 1601.36] has a
[1601.36 → 1601.64] plan
[1601.64 → 1601.84] for
[1601.84 → 1602.00] your
[1602.00 → 1602.38] life
[1602.38 → 1604.12] but
[1604.12 → 1604.28] boy
[1604.28 → 1604.46] that
[1604.46 → 1604.62] can
[1604.62 → 1604.84] leave
[1604.84 → 1604.94] you
[1604.94 → 1605.10] with
[1605.10 → 1605.24] as
[1605.24 → 1605.52] many

[1606.06 → 1606.52] as
[1606.52 → 1606.94] answers
[1606.94 → 1608.50] does
[1608.50 → 1608.64] that
[1608.64 → 1608.82] mean
[1608.82 → 1609.02] that
[1609.02 → 1609.28] Joseph
[1609.28 → 1609.64] being
[1609.64 → 1610.04] sold
[1610.04 → 1610.24] and
[1610.24 → 1610.64] falsely
[1610.64 → 1611.02] accused

[1612.18 → 1612.44] all
[1612.44 → 1612.72] part
[1612.72 → 1612.84] of
[1612.84 → 1613.40] some

[1614.76 → 1614.92] has
[1614.92 → 1615.06] been
[1615.06 → 1615.56] carefully
[1615.56 → 1616.06] sketched
[1616.06 → 1616.20] out
[1616.20 → 1616.38] on

[1617.74 → 1618.40] by God
[1618.40 → 1618.86] himself
[1618.86 → 1619.62] did
[1619.62 → 1620.02] God
[1620.02 → 1620.52] motivate
[1620.52 → 1620.90] ten
[1620.90 → 1621.18] brothers
[1621.18 → 1621.38] to

[1622.78 → 1623.04] sell
[1623.04 → 1623.32] him
[1623.32 → 1624.06] did
[1624.06 → 1624.32] God
[1624.32 → 1624.74] crank
[1624.74 → 1624.96] up

[1626.52 → 1626.68] then
[1626.68 → 1627.22] furthermore
[1627.22 → 1627.62] entice

[1630.76 → 1630.92] is
[1630.92 → 1631.10] it
[1631.10 → 1631.34] truer
[1631.34 → 1631.56] to

[1647.94 → 1648.06] of
[1648.06 → 1648.28] them
[1648.28 → 1649.42] but

[1650.10 → 1650.54] enough

[1662.16 → 1662.34] and
[1662.34 → 1662.78] bad
[1662.78 → 1663.30] stuff
[1663.30 → 1663.80] happening
[1663.80 → 1664.64] even
[1664.64 → 1664.86] to
[1664.86 → 1665.04] his
[1665.04 → 1665.38] own
[1665.38 → 1666.04] children
[1666.04 → 1666.78] on the
[1666.78 → 1666.98] other
[1666.98 → 1667.42] side
[1667.42 → 1668.54] the
[1668.54 → 1668.98] connection
[1668.98 → 1669.44] between
[1669.44 → 1669.68] the
[1669.68 → 1669.94] two
[1669.94 → 1670.54] remaining
[1670.54 → 1671.02] one
[1671.02 → 1671.74] big
[1671.74 → 1672.52] mystery
[1672.52 → 1674.80] that's
[1674.80 → 1675.00] the
[1675.00 → 1675.46] dilemma
[1675.46 → 1676.10] Genesis
[1676.10 → 1676.80] 39
[1676.80 → 1677.40] raises
[1677.40 → 1678.32] though
[1678.32 → 1678.46] it
[1678.46 → 1678.72] doesn't
[1678.72 → 1679.02] solve
[1679.02 → 1679.20] it
[1679.20 → 1680.42] or
[1680.42 → 1680.64] even
[1680.64 → 1681.10] try
[1681.10 → 1682.56] what
[1682.56 → 1682.70] it
[1682.70 → 1682.98] shows
[1682.98 → 1683.54] instead
[1683.54 → 1684.56] is
[1684.56 → 1684.74] that
[1684.74 → 1685.14] God
[1685.14 → 1685.44] is
[1685.44 → 1685.76] with
[1685.76 → 1685.96] his
[1685.96 → 1686.30] people
[1686.30 → 1686.68] God
[1686.68 → 1687.24] sticks
[1687.24 → 1687.54] with
[1687.54 → 1687.80] them
[1687.80 → 1688.42] and
[1688.42 → 1688.72] even
[1688.72 → 1689.08] some
[1689.08 → 1689.22] of
[1689.22 → 1689.38] the
[1689.38 → 1689.72] worst
[1689.72 → 1690.04] things
[1690.04 → 1690.24] that
[1690.24 → 1690.56] come
[1690.56 → 1690.90] our
[1690.90 → 1691.24] way
[1691.24 → 1692.14] don't
[1692.14 → 1692.70] and
[1692.70 → 1693.26] cannot
[1693.26 → 1694.18] derail
[1694.18 → 1694.58] him
[1694.58 → 1696.94] Mrs. P
[1696.94 → 1697.42] might have
[1697.42 → 1697.72] thought
[1697.72 → 1699.18] she'd
[1699.18 → 1699.38] seen
[1699.38 → 1699.54] the
[1699.54 → 1699.82] last
[1699.82 → 1699.98] of
[1699.98 → 1700.32] Joseph
[1700.32 → 1703.04] she is
[1703.04 → 1703.34] going to
[1703.34 → 1703.66] be in
[1703.66 → 1704.02] for the
[1704.02 → 1704.28] same
[1704.28 → 1704.96] surprise
[1704.96 → 1706.18] one
[1706.18 → 1706.52] day
[1706.52 → 1707.14] as
[1707.14 → 1707.58] Joseph's
[1707.58 → 1707.98] brothers
[1707.98 → 1709.94] for as
[1709.94 → 1710.52] long as
[1710.52 → 1711.24] people keep
[1711.24 → 1711.82] tossing
[1711.82 → 1712.24] Joseph
[1712.24 → 1712.82] aside
[1712.82 → 1713.62] like a
[1713.62 → 1713.84] dirty
[1713.84 → 1714.14] old
[1714.14 → 1714.50] rag
[1714.50 → 1715.86] the
[1715.86 → 1716.18] God
[1716.18 → 1716.64] who gave
[1716.64 → 1717.10] Joseph
[1717.10 → 1717.36] his
[1717.36 → 1717.82] dreams
[1717.82 → 1718.04] of
[1718.04 → 1718.46] greatness
[1718.46 → 1719.42] so
[1719.42 → 1719.74] long
[1719.74 → 1720.06] ago
[1720.06 → 1720.50] keeps
[1720.50 → 1720.92] catching
[1720.92 → 1721.30] him
[1721.30 → 1722.10] in
[1722.10 → 1722.34] the
[1722.34 → 1722.76] sovereign
[1722.76 → 1723.16] and
[1723.16 → 1723.64] divine
[1723.64 → 1724.38] arms
[1724.38 → 1725.06] of
[1725.06 → 1725.48] grace
[1725.48 → 1728.10] and
[1728.10 → 1728.46] while we
[1728.46 → 1728.78] may not
[1728.78 → 1728.98] have
[1728.98 → 1729.30] all the
[1729.30 → 1729.68] answers
[1729.68 → 1730.44] to the
[1730.44 → 1730.78] loose
[1730.78 → 1731.16] ends
[1731.16 → 1731.52] of
[1731.52 → 1732.16] providence
[1732.16 → 1733.56] there is
[1733.56 → 1734.02] something
[1734.02 → 1734.64] comforting
[1734.64 → 1735.82] about the
[1735.82 → 1736.44] divine
[1736.44 → 1737.90] doggedness
[1737.90 → 1738.76] and
[1738.76 → 1739.50] persistence
[1739.50 → 1739.96] and
[1739.96 → 1740.62] determination
[1740.62 → 1741.36] that we
[1741.36 → 1741.76] see
[1741.76 → 1742.70] not only
[1742.70 → 1743.12] in the
[1743.12 → 1743.42] Joseph
[1743.42 → 1743.96] story
[1743.96 → 1745.74] but in
[1745.74 → 1746.22] all of
[1746.22 → 1746.62] Genesis
[1746.62 → 1747.90] and all
[1747.90 → 1748.16] of the
[1748.16 → 1748.52] Bible
[1748.52 → 1749.38] isn't
[1749.38 → 1749.62] there
[1749.62 → 1750.70] come
[1750.70 → 1751.14] hell
[1751.14 → 1751.66] or high
[1751.66 → 1752.00] water
[1752.00 → 1753.62] God
[1753.62 → 1753.84] will
[1753.84 → 1754.38] realize
[1754.38 → 1754.60] his
[1754.60 → 1754.98] promise
[1754.98 → 1755.16] to
[1755.16 → 1755.54] Abraham
[1755.54 → 1756.62] and
[1756.62 → 1756.76] his
[1756.76 → 1757.02] good
[1757.02 → 1757.42] plan
[1757.42 → 1757.66] to
[1757.66 → 1758.04] bless
[1758.04 → 1758.68] all
[1758.68 → 1759.14] peoples
[1759.14 → 1759.46] on
[1759.46 → 1759.76] earth
[1759.76 → 1760.74] in
[1760.74 → 1761.00] that
[1761.00 → 1761.62] determined
[1761.62 → 1762.34] providence
[1762.34 → 1763.82] is
[1763.82 → 1764.08] our
[1764.08 → 1764.46] every
[1764.46 → 1764.76] hope
[1764.76 → 1766.02] especially
[1766.02 → 1766.38] in
[1766.38 → 1766.86] times
[1766.86 → 1767.84] when
[1767.84 → 1768.18] like
[1768.18 → 1768.52] Joseph
[1768.52 → 1769.38] we
[1769.38 → 1769.68] feel
[1769.68 → 1770.34] confusion
[1770.34 → 1771.30] and
[1771.30 → 1771.70] pain
[1771.70 → 1773.50] and
[1773.50 → 1773.74] however
[1773.74 → 1774.18] we
[1774.18 → 1774.74] understand
[1774.74 → 1775.42] providence
[1775.42 → 1776.68] precisely
[1776.68 → 1777.14] because
[1777.14 → 1777.48] God
[1777.48 → 1777.86] is
[1777.86 → 1778.20] good
[1778.20 → 1778.90] and
[1778.90 → 1779.20] God
[1779.20 → 1779.54] is
[1779.54 → 1779.96] loving
[1779.96 → 1780.86] and
[1780.86 → 1781.12] God
[1781.12 → 1781.48] is
[1781.48 → 1781.80] also
[1781.80 → 1782.04] so
[1782.04 → 1782.46] very
[1782.46 → 1783.08] powerful
[1783.08 → 1784.48] we
[1784.48 → 1785.00] know
[1785.00 → 1785.38] he
[1785.38 → 1785.64] will
[1785.64 → 1786.18] never
[1786.18 → 1787.08] let
[1787.08 → 1787.50] this
[1787.50 → 1788.18] life's
[1788.18 → 1788.98] tragedies
[1788.98 → 1790.02] have
[1790.02 → 1790.18] the
[1790.18 → 1790.44] last
[1790.44 → 1790.78] word
[1790.78 → 1793.32] and
[1793.32 → 1793.46] we
[1793.46 → 1793.70] know
[1793.70 → 1793.88] it
[1793.88 → 1794.36] because
[1794.36 → 1795.70] as
[1795.70 → 1795.86] we
[1795.86 → 1796.18] follow
[1796.18 → 1796.78] Joseph's
[1796.78 → 1797.12] story
[1797.12 → 1798.22] we
[1798.22 → 1798.48] cannot
[1798.48 → 1798.78] help
[1798.78 → 1798.94] but
[1798.94 → 1799.08] be
[1799.08 → 1799.52] reminded
[1799.52 → 1799.80] of
[1799.80 → 1800.06] another
[1800.06 → 1800.56] story
[1800.56 → 1801.60] of
[1801.60 → 1801.84] one
[1801.84 → 1802.04] who
[1802.04 → 1802.30] though
[1802.30 → 1802.78] innocent
[1802.78 → 1803.56] was
[1803.56 → 1804.02] betrayed
[1804.02 → 1805.38] whose
[1805.38 → 1806.00] integrity
[1806.00 → 1806.64] challenged
[1806.64 → 1807.04] another
[1807.04 → 1807.58] empire
[1807.58 → 1808.88] and
[1808.88 → 1809.04] whose
[1809.04 → 1809.38] God
[1809.38 → 1809.68] seemed
[1809.68 → 1809.86] to
[1809.86 → 1810.30] abandon
[1810.30 → 1810.66] him
[1810.66 → 1811.40] to
[1811.40 → 1811.58] a
[1811.58 → 1811.94] cross
[1811.94 → 1813.30] we
[1813.30 → 1813.54] know
[1813.54 → 1813.70] it
[1813.70 → 1814.06] because
[1814.06 → 1814.30] we
[1814.30 → 1814.58] know
[1814.58 → 1814.88] our
[1814.88 → 1815.10] Lord
[1815.10 → 1815.40] Jesus
[1815.40 → 1815.86] Christ
[1815.86 → 1816.06] who
[1816.06 → 1816.26] on
[1816.26 → 1816.42] the
[1816.42 → 1816.76] darkest
[1816.76 → 1817.20] Friday
[1817.20 → 1817.44] there
[1817.44 → 1817.72] ever
[1817.72 → 1818.12] was
[1818.12 → 1819.36] as
[1819.36 → 1819.46] he
[1819.46 → 1819.64] was
[1819.64 → 1820.04] dying
[1820.04 → 1820.38] inch
[1820.38 → 1820.54] by
[1820.54 → 1821.06] painful
[1821.06 → 1821.52] inch
[1821.52 → 1822.42] on
[1822.42 → 1822.58] a
[1822.58 → 1823.02] cross
[1823.02 → 1823.82] from
[1823.82 → 1824.06] his
[1824.06 → 1824.38] fatal
[1824.38 → 1824.82] wounds
[1824.82 → 1825.94] cried
[1825.94 → 1826.24] out
[1826.24 → 1826.54] my
[1826.54 → 1827.02] God
[1827.02 → 1827.26] my
[1827.26 → 1827.66] God
[1827.66 → 1828.20] why
[1828.20 → 1828.74] have
[1828.74 → 1828.90] you
[1828.90 → 1829.48] forsaken
[1829.48 → 1829.82] me
[1829.82 → 1832.00] but
[1832.00 → 1832.24] who
[1832.24 → 1832.62] three
[1832.62 → 1832.90] days
[1832.90 → 1833.28] later
[1833.28 → 1834.76] was
[1834.76 → 1835.26] alive
[1835.26 → 1835.68] again
[1835.68 → 1836.82] appeared
[1836.82 → 1837.00] to
[1837.00 → 1837.22] his
[1837.22 → 1837.72] disciples
[1837.72 → 1838.66] and
[1838.66 → 1839.12] said
[1839.12 → 1840.28] peace
[1840.28 → 1841.32] be
[1841.32 → 1841.58] with
[1841.58 → 1841.84] you
[1841.84 → 1844.10] because
[1844.10 → 1844.46] we
[1844.46 → 1844.76] know
[1844.76 → 1845.20] him
[1845.20 → 1845.86] for
[1845.86 → 1846.30] us
[1846.30 → 1847.08] as
[1847.08 → 1847.28] for
[1847.28 → 1847.70] Joseph
[1847.70 → 1848.00] in
[1848.00 → 1848.36] Genesis
[1848.36 → 1848.92] 39
[1848.92 → 1850.16] the
[1850.16 → 1850.56] last
[1850.56 → 1850.78] thing
[1850.78 → 1850.98] to
[1850.98 → 1851.30] say
[1851.30 → 1852.02] will
[1852.02 → 1852.52] always
[1852.52 → 1852.88] be
[1852.88 → 1853.54] the
[1853.54 → 1853.96] same
[1853.96 → 1854.60] as
[1854.60 → 1854.80] the
[1854.80 → 1855.14] first
[1855.14 → 1855.30] thing

[1855.50 → 1855.78] say
[1855.78 → 1857.50] the
[1857.50 → 1857.84] Lord
[1857.84 → 1858.72] is
[1858.72 → 1859.00] with
[1859.00 → 1859.36] us
[1859.36 → 1860.74] whatever
[1860.74 → 1861.26] your
[1861.26 → 1862.14] circumstances
[1862.14 → 1863.32] the
[1863.32 → 1863.70] Lord
[1863.70 → 1864.80] is
[1864.80 → 1866.00] with
[1866.00 → 1866.36] us
[1866.36 → 1867.28] in
[1867.28 → 1867.42] the
[1867.42 → 1867.60] name
[1867.60 → 1867.74] of
[1867.74 → 1867.88] the

[1869.66 → 1869.86] Holy
[1869.86 → 1870.28] Spirit
[1870.28 → 1871.98] let's
[1871.98 → 1872.24] pray
