[0.00 --> 6.02]  Well, good morning again. A number of weeks ago when I first came, I said I was going to
[6.02 --> 11.62]  share four messages on the book of Jonah, and today is message number four.
[12.78 --> 19.08]  And before we read from Jonah chapter four, just a reminder that I also challenged in the very
[19.08 --> 26.22]  first sermon for you to think about where was there a parallel story in the New Testament
[26.22 --> 31.98]  that would teach a similar lesson, and I hope you've thought about that over the last number
[31.98 --> 37.48]  of weeks, and towards the end of the sermon, I'll share what I think is that parallel story
[37.48 --> 45.34]  that arises out of the story of Jonah, but also out of the nature of the story and the
[45.34 --> 47.40]  structure of the story itself.
[47.40 --> 54.40]  I wonder if you've ever been asked a probing question.
[54.40 --> 63.24]  Now, that's probably happened to you, whether or not it's apparent, why did you do that?
[63.24 --> 71.80]  Or a teacher in an oral examination who says to you, please provide me three reasons for
[71.80 --> 78.14]  the outbreak of, say, the Second World War.
[78.14 --> 84.68]  Or perhaps at a job interview, just like was alluded to with Pastor Chris.
[84.68 --> 96.10]  Well, what passage of Scripture would you use to encourage people to step forward into a task?
[96.10 --> 101.44]  Or perhaps a police officer pulls you over and say, what's your hurry?
[101.44 --> 104.44]  And you have to think.
[104.44 --> 115.76]  See, a probing question is by its nature a question that strives towards understanding.
[115.76 --> 125.38]  It wants to make you go a little deeper and search out matters a little more thoroughly.
[125.38 --> 127.72]  So we have been looking at the story of Jonah.
[127.72 --> 135.52]  There are many questions that you could ask about Jonah the person, Jonah the prophet, Jonah
[135.52 --> 136.86]  the writer.
[136.86 --> 138.46]  Did he write the book himself?
[138.46 --> 140.14]  Did he relate the book to others?
[140.14 --> 147.58]  Those are all probing, biblical study, theological questions.
[147.58 --> 151.12]  Or one could ask the question, summarize the book of Jonah.
[151.12 --> 153.12]  And you can do it this way.
[153.12 --> 155.40]  Jonah ran.
[155.40 --> 157.46]  Jonah repented.
[157.46 --> 161.18]  Jonah preached repentance.
[161.18 --> 164.64]  Jonah ranted and raved.
[164.64 --> 165.74]  Jonah with R's.
[165.74 --> 167.46]  Jonah ran.
[167.46 --> 169.46]  Jonah repented.
[169.46 --> 172.24]  Jonah preached repentance.
[172.24 --> 177.12]  Jonah ranted and raved.
[177.12 --> 184.98]  And then you could be asked a more probing question, is that really what the story is about?
[184.98 --> 193.70]  Maybe you should say, if you run, you cannot hide from the God of the Hebrews because he
[193.70 --> 199.18]  is the creator of the heavens and the earth and he will send a storm in your way to stop
[199.18 --> 201.84]  you from running.
[201.84 --> 204.30]  Or, you know, that's the identity issue.
[204.30 --> 207.16]  Or the chapter two.
[207.16 --> 212.86]  When you're going down, look up.
[212.86 --> 218.06]  And learn that salvation is from the Lord.
[218.06 --> 221.76]  Or in chapter three.
[221.76 --> 228.70]  When you are given a second chance, take it.
[228.70 --> 233.32]  And Jonah was told again, and then he went and he preached repentance.
[233.32 --> 236.56]  Well, what would we say about chapter four?
[236.56 --> 238.70]  Well, let's take, let's read chapter four.
[238.70 --> 244.66]  And I want to begin by reading the last verse of chapter three.
[244.66 --> 250.84]  Now chapter three gives the story of Jonah going to preach repentance in Nineveh.
[250.84 --> 258.32]  And there is this collective response from the citizens of Nineveh, from the king to the least
[258.32 --> 263.36]  person in terms of the social economic strata.
[263.36 --> 267.08]  They're all wearing sackcloth and ashes.
[267.08 --> 269.08]  And then chapter three ends with these words.
[269.08 --> 276.32]  When God saw what they did and how they turned from their evil ways, he relented.
[276.84 --> 278.40]  Take a note of that word.
[278.82 --> 283.86]  He relented and did not bring on them the destructions he had threatened.
[285.24 --> 289.46]  But to Jonah, this seemed very wrong.
[289.86 --> 291.62]  And he became angry.
[291.62 --> 298.70]  Let me just stop there for a moment and point out that you could translate the Hebrew to
[298.70 --> 302.86]  Jonah, this seemed to be evil.
[305.38 --> 308.78]  To say this seemed to be wrong misses the point.
[308.78 --> 311.16]  Now, what is evil?
[311.46 --> 312.40]  What is wrong?
[312.74 --> 316.02]  Well, the relenting of God.
[317.50 --> 319.42]  The relenting of God.
[319.42 --> 322.00]  To Jonah, this seemed very wrong.
[322.10 --> 323.14]  And he became angry.
[323.82 --> 329.58]  And he prayed to the Lord, isn't this what I said, Lord, when I was still at home, that
[329.58 --> 332.74]  this is what I tried to forestall by fleeing to Tarshish?
[333.18 --> 341.72]  I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abounding in love, a God
[341.72 --> 344.16]  who relents from sending calamity.
[344.16 --> 348.86]  Now, Lord, take away my life.
[349.32 --> 352.18]  For it is better for me to die than to live.
[354.24 --> 360.54]  But the Lord replied, probing, is it right for you to be angry?
[361.84 --> 365.86]  Jonah had gone out and sat down at a place east of the city.
[366.44 --> 371.60]  There he made himself a shelter, sat in a shade, and waited to see what would happen to the city.
[371.60 --> 379.30]  Then the Lord provided a leafy plant and made it grow up over Jonah to give shade for his head to ease his discomfort.
[379.58 --> 381.96]  And Jonah was very happy about the plant.
[382.90 --> 389.08]  But at dawn the next day, God provided a worm, which chewed the plant so that it withered.
[389.08 --> 397.16]  When the sun rose, God provided a scorching east wind, and the sun blazed on Jonah's head so that he grew faint.
[397.72 --> 403.26]  He wanted to die and said, it would be better for me to die than to live.
[404.06 --> 411.06]  But God said to Jonah, probing, is it right for you to be angry about the plant?
[411.06 --> 415.70]  It is, he said, and I am so angry, I wish I were dead.
[416.92 --> 422.72]  But the Lord said, you have been concerned about this plant, though you did not tend it or make it grow.
[423.30 --> 425.84]  It sprang up overnight and died overnight.
[427.42 --> 428.60]  Notice it's a question.
[428.60 --> 444.54]  This is the word of the Lord.
[445.70 --> 448.54]  Have you ever been asked a probing question?
[449.74 --> 454.12]  Well, Jonah gets asked three probing questions.
[454.12 --> 456.26]  He answers two.
[456.72 --> 458.82]  He doesn't answer the third.
[459.88 --> 460.92]  That is left.
[462.08 --> 469.76]  He answers the first one by going out and sitting east of the city.
[470.58 --> 472.30]  And the question is, why?
[472.42 --> 473.44]  Well, there are hills there.
[475.42 --> 479.76]  And he could now sit on a hill and look down.
[479.76 --> 492.50]  Jonah does not articulate anything.
[492.64 --> 495.16]  Later he will say, yeah, it is right for me to be angry.
[495.44 --> 498.98]  But in this case, he does not give an answer.
[500.52 --> 505.66]  But we know that actions speak louder than words.
[505.66 --> 512.02]  And Jonah's actions have been demonstrated throughout this story.
[512.36 --> 514.36]  He hears a word and he runs.
[514.78 --> 518.16]  He gets thrown overboard and swallowed by a huge fish.
[518.34 --> 519.78]  And he repents.
[520.14 --> 523.94]  He hears a word and he takes action.
[524.94 --> 526.32]  He goes and he preaches.
[527.32 --> 530.76]  And then he watches the compassion of God.
[531.58 --> 532.84]  And he's mad.
[533.68 --> 535.42]  He is angry.
[535.66 --> 537.96]  He is furious.
[539.24 --> 539.86]  Why?
[539.86 --> 543.06]  Because God has relented.
[544.26 --> 549.92]  And Nineveh, in Jonah's judgment, is a nation that ought to be destroyed.
[550.64 --> 551.84]  They are evil people.
[552.20 --> 554.40]  They are enemies of Israel.
[554.92 --> 556.28]  They are a danger.
[556.72 --> 564.14]  Indeed, a number of decades from this point, Assyria, of which Nineveh was the capital,
[564.14 --> 569.34]  grew strong enough to take the northern part of Israel into captivity and it disappeared.
[569.34 --> 573.54]  Jonah wanted them destroyed.
[573.54 --> 577.32]  And he is angry.
[577.32 --> 583.54]  And he uses spiritual disciplines to express his anger.
[583.54 --> 584.54]  He prays to the Lord.
[584.54 --> 585.28]  He prays to the Lord.
[585.28 --> 589.06]  And basically he says, I told you so.
[590.06 --> 591.30]  I told you so.
[592.94 --> 597.48]  You are a God of compassion and grace.
[597.48 --> 599.48]  He prays to the Lord.
[599.48 --> 600.48]  He prays to the Lord.
[600.48 --> 601.68]  He prays to the Lord.
[601.68 --> 603.68]  He prays to the Lord.
[603.68 --> 604.78]  He prays to God.
[604.78 --> 605.76]  Not to praise him.
[605.76 --> 606.88]  Not to thank him.
[607.88 --> 610.42]  But he prays to God to criticize him.
[611.90 --> 616.10]  And then he uses scripture to buttress his criticism.
[616.10 --> 621.86]  These words that Jonah uses come from Exodus chapter 34 verses 6 and 7.
[621.86 --> 628.92]  And that's the particular story where Moses has asked God to reveal himself to Moses.
[630.04 --> 631.82]  And God says, that's fine.
[632.28 --> 637.20]  But you can only see my back because you cannot see my face.
[637.76 --> 639.22]  And we have a song.
[639.34 --> 644.48]  He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock and covers me there with his hand.
[644.48 --> 647.82]  So Jonah uses scripture.
[649.38 --> 650.44]  Makes you think.
[651.72 --> 653.88]  Makes you probe your own actions.
[654.50 --> 656.46]  How do I use prayer?
[658.14 --> 659.68]  How do I use scripture?
[660.78 --> 665.62]  Timothy Keller in a very provocative book that he has on Jonah called The Prodigal Prophet
[665.62 --> 670.84]  says that when you use scripture you ought to think very clearly about your use of it.
[671.28 --> 673.20]  You shouldn't be bludgeoning people with it.
[673.20 --> 675.58]  You shouldn't be bludgeoning God with it.
[676.48 --> 678.60]  You shouldn't be using it as a crowbar.
[679.66 --> 684.08]  You use it as a mirror to reflect upon yourself.
[685.18 --> 691.62]  And Keller says when you use scripture properly it evokes within you a sense of humility.
[691.62 --> 695.70]  I know who I am.
[696.90 --> 697.80]  I'm a sinner.
[698.94 --> 700.16]  I'm self-centered.
[701.12 --> 702.30]  I'm a nationalist.
[703.14 --> 704.44]  I'm a legalist.
[704.98 --> 706.88]  All of those things Jonah was.
[707.34 --> 711.06]  Jonah didn't care about the Ninevites as people.
[712.16 --> 713.34]  They were enemies.
[714.10 --> 715.32]  A threat to his nation.
[716.26 --> 716.94]  Get rid of them.
[716.94 --> 719.50]  He was a legalist.
[720.06 --> 721.70]  I told you so.
[723.06 --> 724.64]  He was self-righteous.
[725.68 --> 729.46]  Well I'm a recipient of grace but they don't deserve it.
[730.16 --> 730.90]  I do.
[731.38 --> 732.16]  They don't.
[732.16 --> 739.54]  Humility is one thing that needs to come when you look at yourself through the scripture.
[740.80 --> 742.36]  Critique needs to come.
[743.32 --> 745.18]  I could do this better.
[746.26 --> 749.18]  You know think we heard this morning the words of Philippians.
[749.62 --> 754.30]  Have this attitude amongst yourselves which is also the attitude of Christ Jesus.
[754.30 --> 761.20]  As though he was in the form of God he emptied himself and took on the form of a servant.
[762.82 --> 767.64]  And you ask yourself how well am I doing in that regard?
[767.64 --> 774.08]  And then Keller points out one more function of scripture and that is to encourage.
[775.36 --> 780.02]  To encourage you in your relationship with God because the Lord is your shepherd.
[780.64 --> 781.92]  The Lord is your father.
[782.50 --> 784.42]  The Lord wants a relationship with you.
[784.88 --> 786.14]  He cares for you deeply.
[786.14 --> 797.54]  And he will probe and confront you as he does me until he gets his way in our lives.
[799.82 --> 801.94]  Is it right for you to be angry?
[804.80 --> 806.36]  And Jonah said yeah it is.
[808.04 --> 815.42]  And I'm thinking that by prayer and by using scripture I can get you to change your mind.
[815.42 --> 817.46]  So I'm going to go sit in the hills.
[818.22 --> 819.34]  I'm going to make a shelter.
[820.08 --> 821.68]  And I'm going to watch what you do.
[822.48 --> 827.56]  And I will approve if you do a Hiroshima and a Nagasaki on Nineveh.
[827.90 --> 833.08]  I will approve if you do a Beirut of August 2020 on Nineveh.
[833.32 --> 840.48]  I will approve if you drop an atomic bomb or if you let ammonia nitrate explode in the middle of that city.
[840.72 --> 842.54]  And all of those people get destroyed.
[842.54 --> 844.32]  I will approve.
[844.32 --> 847.32]  As a matter of fact I will no longer be angry.
[850.68 --> 852.26]  And then ask yourself.
[853.58 --> 857.96]  What is my attitude towards people who are different than I?
[859.10 --> 860.56]  Who challenge me?
[861.80 --> 863.80]  Who maybe even threaten me?
[865.48 --> 869.50]  Who would I rather see punished than forgiven?
[869.50 --> 875.02]  Who would I rather see punished than forgiven?
[877.96 --> 883.44]  And God comes to Jonah and allows a leafy plant to grow up.
[883.50 --> 888.52]  We have no idea what sort of plant that is but it must have grown quickly and had broad leaves.
[888.52 --> 893.28]  And for the first time in the story Jonah is happy.
[894.40 --> 899.02]  For the first time he gets what he thinks he deserves.
[899.98 --> 904.32]  For the first time Jonah is appreciative.
[905.98 --> 912.20]  Because it's cool sitting here waiting to see what will happen.
[912.20 --> 919.70]  Will there be a Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Beirut dumped upon Nineveh upon these people?
[921.78 --> 928.52]  And then overnight God sends a worm and the leafy plant dies.
[928.98 --> 931.70]  And God sends a hot wind.
[932.70 --> 934.14]  And Jonah grows faint.
[934.14 --> 937.82]  And Jonah complains.
[937.96 --> 943.28]  He says it would be better for me to die.
[946.74 --> 947.34]  Stop.
[947.46 --> 948.52]  Think about that for a moment.
[950.04 --> 954.64]  The amount of despair that Jonah feels personally.
[954.64 --> 962.02]  It is better for me to die than to see the compassion of God at work.
[964.34 --> 966.22]  It demands reflection.
[968.14 --> 971.34]  Reflection on myself and in myself.
[971.90 --> 976.40]  Who would I rather see punished than forgiven?
[976.40 --> 981.74]  And God comes with a probing question.
[981.84 --> 983.10]  Is it right for you to be angry?
[984.04 --> 985.08]  Yes it is.
[986.86 --> 987.80]  Yes it is.
[987.86 --> 990.14]  Who are you to ask me a question like that?
[990.18 --> 991.70]  Because I am uncomfortable.
[992.36 --> 993.44]  It is hot.
[994.08 --> 995.98]  And I'm disappointed in you.
[996.18 --> 999.66]  Because you haven't thrown the bomb yet on those people.
[1000.42 --> 1001.60]  Yes it is.
[1003.74 --> 1005.06]  You ever felt that way?
[1006.40 --> 1008.24]  Justified in your anger?
[1009.54 --> 1014.76]  Justified in your judgment on people you would rather see destroyed than forgiven?
[1016.76 --> 1018.30]  I think we all have.
[1019.24 --> 1024.32]  It is hard to read the history of the Second World War and not to be angry.
[1025.40 --> 1030.18]  Not to be angry at the blatant destruction of about 10 million people.
[1030.84 --> 1032.52]  6 million of whom were Jews.
[1033.08 --> 1036.18]  And they were executed simply because of their ethnicity.
[1036.40 --> 1044.40]  And about 4 million were people whether they were gypsies or people with social and physical calamity.
[1045.32 --> 1050.32]  Or people who were just not of the right color to fit in.
[1050.32 --> 1063.80]  And when I look at that from a historical personal perspective I think I'd rather see those folks who did that executed than forgiven.
[1063.80 --> 1076.72]  Except then that famous phrase there but for the grace of God go I kicks in.
[1078.72 --> 1082.64]  There but for the grace of God go I.
[1082.64 --> 1083.32]  There but for the grace of God go I.
[1083.32 --> 1084.12]  There but for the grace of God.
[1084.24 --> 1086.48]  Is it right for you to end, I think I would rather see my sin and will be angry.
[1086.48 --> 1087.94]  Yes it is.
[1088.02 --> 1093.48]  It is better for me now to die than to live.
[1093.48 --> 1096.66]  this is not a casual feeling
[1096.66 --> 1099.10]  this is something that's rooted
[1099.10 --> 1100.20]  deep
[1100.20 --> 1102.10]  within Jonah
[1102.10 --> 1107.14]  and then God asks
[1107.14 --> 1109.22]  another question
[1109.22 --> 1113.06]  he makes Jonah consider
[1113.06 --> 1115.06]  and I've got to get the wording right on this
[1115.06 --> 1116.72]  he makes Jonah consider
[1116.72 --> 1119.64]  the character of God
[1119.64 --> 1122.66]  notice this
[1122.66 --> 1124.22]  and should I not
[1124.22 --> 1125.74]  have concern
[1125.74 --> 1128.36]  for the great city of Nineveh
[1128.36 --> 1130.18]  in which there are more than
[1130.18 --> 1131.94]  120,000 people
[1131.94 --> 1134.64]  who cannot tell their right hand from their left
[1134.64 --> 1136.90]  and also many animals
[1136.90 --> 1138.96]  should
[1138.96 --> 1140.20]  I
[1140.20 --> 1142.26]  not have
[1142.26 --> 1143.32]  concern
[1143.32 --> 1148.54]  now Jonah has
[1148.54 --> 1150.56]  to make a switch he's no longer
[1150.56 --> 1152.00]  thinking about himself
[1152.00 --> 1154.44]  and about his anger
[1154.44 --> 1157.84]  he now has to think
[1157.84 --> 1161.12]  because of this probing question
[1161.12 --> 1163.58]  about the character
[1163.58 --> 1165.22]  of God
[1165.22 --> 1170.30]  should I not have concern
[1170.30 --> 1174.94]  God lays out a few details
[1174.94 --> 1177.24]  it is a great city
[1177.24 --> 1180.78]  it is an expansive city
[1180.78 --> 1182.62]  and in that city there are
[1182.62 --> 1185.04]  hundreds of thousands of people
[1185.04 --> 1189.22]  120,000 of whom
[1189.22 --> 1191.22]  do not know their right hand
[1191.22 --> 1192.62]  from their left hand
[1192.62 --> 1194.56]  in other words
[1194.56 --> 1195.60]  their kids
[1195.60 --> 1198.32]  their little kids
[1198.32 --> 1201.16]  there was an amazing
[1201.16 --> 1203.50]  picture on the news this week
[1203.50 --> 1206.36]  about the explosion in Beirut
[1206.36 --> 1207.88]  a father was filming
[1207.88 --> 1209.94]  as his wife was
[1209.94 --> 1213.18]  being rolled into the delivery room
[1213.18 --> 1214.98]  for their first child
[1214.98 --> 1216.44]  to be born
[1216.44 --> 1217.72]  and just as
[1217.72 --> 1219.10]  the gurney
[1219.10 --> 1220.68]  went into the delivery room
[1220.68 --> 1222.12]  the explosion took place
[1222.12 --> 1224.60]  and you see the whole delivery room structure
[1224.60 --> 1225.56]  just collapse
[1226.12 --> 1227.98]  and there is glass
[1227.98 --> 1229.02]  all over the place
[1229.02 --> 1229.98]  and there is dust
[1229.98 --> 1230.56]  and debris
[1230.56 --> 1231.46]  all over the place
[1231.46 --> 1232.42]  this had been
[1232.42 --> 1233.40]  I would assume
[1233.40 --> 1234.96]  a fairly sterile
[1234.96 --> 1236.28]  situation
[1236.28 --> 1240.04]  father got up
[1240.04 --> 1242.72]  child was born
[1242.72 --> 1243.92]  they named him George
[1243.92 --> 1248.16]  and it got on the national news
[1248.16 --> 1250.12]  the Canadian national news
[1250.12 --> 1253.90]  because of a remarkable moment
[1253.90 --> 1255.52]  but you know George
[1255.52 --> 1257.52]  who is now less than a week old
[1257.52 --> 1260.02]  George doesn't know his right hand
[1260.02 --> 1261.12]  from his left hand
[1261.12 --> 1264.18]  George doesn't even know his name
[1264.18 --> 1266.78]  George doesn't know
[1266.78 --> 1268.12]  that his picture
[1268.12 --> 1269.70]  has been broadcast
[1269.70 --> 1270.96]  around the world
[1270.96 --> 1273.78]  George just knows
[1273.78 --> 1275.52]  when his diaper is wet
[1275.52 --> 1276.80]  and his stomach is empty
[1276.80 --> 1279.10]  that's what George knows
[1279.10 --> 1280.68]  and George knows
[1280.68 --> 1281.48]  that his mother
[1281.48 --> 1283.20]  seems to be the source
[1283.20 --> 1285.26]  and answer to his most immediate needs
[1285.26 --> 1286.20]  and every once in a while
[1286.20 --> 1287.26]  dad shows up too
[1287.26 --> 1289.42]  that's what George knows
[1289.42 --> 1294.48]  his parents are concerned for him
[1294.48 --> 1299.22]  God is concerned for him
[1299.22 --> 1302.82]  should he not be concerned
[1302.82 --> 1304.88]  for people who do not know
[1304.88 --> 1305.84]  their right hand
[1305.84 --> 1307.26]  from their left hand
[1307.26 --> 1309.70]  and of course we say
[1309.70 --> 1311.24]  of course you should be concerned
[1311.24 --> 1313.02]  and then he says
[1313.02 --> 1315.94]  and there are many animals besides
[1315.94 --> 1319.06]  many animals besides
[1319.06 --> 1321.82]  you know soon it will be Thanksgiving
[1321.82 --> 1323.84]  it's only a couple months away
[1323.84 --> 1325.68]  and a song will sing
[1325.68 --> 1327.04]  let all things now living
[1327.04 --> 1328.38]  a song of thanksgiving
[1328.38 --> 1329.68]  to God the creator
[1329.68 --> 1331.84]  triumphantly raise
[1331.84 --> 1334.04]  who fashioned and made us
[1334.04 --> 1336.06]  protected and stayed us
[1336.06 --> 1338.26]  who guides us and leads us
[1338.26 --> 1340.78]  to the ends of our days
[1340.78 --> 1342.86]  God's concerned for us
[1342.86 --> 1345.02]  but he's concerned for all
[1345.02 --> 1347.44]  living things
[1347.44 --> 1353.32]  should I not be concerned
[1353.32 --> 1357.70]  and I look
[1357.70 --> 1359.42]  and I listen
[1359.42 --> 1361.84]  to the needs in the world
[1361.84 --> 1365.30]  and should I not be concerned
[1365.30 --> 1367.62]  as an image bearer of God
[1367.62 --> 1371.44]  Jonah sat outside the city
[1371.44 --> 1372.78]  and waited
[1372.78 --> 1376.84]  Jesus stood outside the city
[1376.84 --> 1378.48]  and wept
[1378.48 --> 1381.20]  how I would have gathered you
[1381.20 --> 1382.80]  as a hen gathers her chicks
[1382.80 --> 1384.12]  under her wings
[1384.12 --> 1387.80]  but you would not
[1387.80 --> 1389.16]  but he didn't get angry
[1389.16 --> 1392.36]  he just kept writing
[1392.36 --> 1394.72]  until they arrested him
[1394.72 --> 1395.84]  crucified him
[1395.84 --> 1396.84]  buried him
[1396.84 --> 1399.38]  and then he confronted them
[1399.38 --> 1400.00]  with saying
[1400.00 --> 1401.16]  there's a new day
[1401.16 --> 1402.94]  a new day
[1402.94 --> 1403.88]  a new day has dawned
[1403.88 --> 1406.32]  and we're going to celebrate life
[1406.32 --> 1408.52]  and the message of salvation
[1408.52 --> 1410.16]  comes to the world
[1410.16 --> 1411.44]  through the Jews
[1411.44 --> 1413.12]  but it is for all people
[1413.12 --> 1414.82]  regardless of ethnicity
[1414.82 --> 1415.88]  and race
[1415.88 --> 1418.50]  it is for all people
[1418.50 --> 1421.58]  regardless of social economic status
[1421.58 --> 1424.40]  it is for all people
[1424.40 --> 1428.02]  regardless of gender orientation
[1428.02 --> 1431.60]  it is for those
[1431.60 --> 1432.60]  who are made
[1432.60 --> 1433.64]  in the image
[1433.64 --> 1434.70]  of my father
[1434.70 --> 1435.38]  salvation
[1435.38 --> 1437.26]  is from
[1437.26 --> 1438.64]  the Lord
[1438.64 --> 1442.08]  but notice
[1442.08 --> 1444.82]  that Jonah has
[1444.82 --> 1446.18]  no reply
[1446.18 --> 1448.30]  to the question
[1448.30 --> 1449.76]  should I
[1449.76 --> 1450.44]  not
[1450.44 --> 1451.02]  be
[1451.02 --> 1451.80]  concerned
[1451.80 --> 1453.40]  there's no answer
[1453.40 --> 1456.02]  and here's the key
[1456.02 --> 1457.28]  anybody have an idea
[1457.28 --> 1458.22]  you can speak up
[1458.22 --> 1460.06]  what story I'm thinking of
[1460.06 --> 1462.08]  in terms of the New Testament
[1462.08 --> 1463.00]  that parallels
[1463.00 --> 1465.02]  the Old Testament story of Jonah
[1465.02 --> 1467.96]  the prodigal son
[1467.96 --> 1469.98]  or the parable of the waiting father
[1469.98 --> 1471.90]  Jonah 1 and 2
[1471.90 --> 1473.74]  is the story of Jonah running
[1473.74 --> 1475.76]  and repenting
[1475.76 --> 1479.10]  the story of the youngest son
[1479.10 --> 1481.60]  chapters 3 and 4
[1481.60 --> 1483.42]  is the story of the oldest son
[1483.42 --> 1485.84]  who rants and raves
[1485.84 --> 1487.26]  at his father's generosity
[1487.26 --> 1489.72]  and his father goes out to him
[1489.72 --> 1490.92]  and invites him to come in
[1490.92 --> 1491.68]  but
[1491.68 --> 1493.10]  we're not told
[1493.10 --> 1495.48]  if the oldest son comes in or not
[1495.48 --> 1498.66]  and we're not told
[1498.66 --> 1501.04]  what Jonah's reaction is
[1501.04 --> 1504.04]  and there is a clear reason for it
[1504.04 --> 1505.78]  because I'm Jonah
[1505.78 --> 1508.24]  and you're Jonah
[1508.24 --> 1512.72]  and we need to answer God's probing question
[1512.72 --> 1516.66]  is it right for you to be angry
[1516.66 --> 1520.88]  should I not be concerned
[1520.88 --> 1524.30]  answer this question
[1524.30 --> 1526.18]  who would you rather see judged
[1526.18 --> 1526.98]  and condemned
[1526.98 --> 1529.68]  rather than forgiven
[1529.68 --> 1533.54]  and God comes and he says
[1533.54 --> 1535.14]  I sent my son
[1535.14 --> 1538.34]  and he endured the cross
[1538.34 --> 1539.70]  why?
[1539.84 --> 1541.02]  well the book of Hebrews says
[1541.02 --> 1543.12]  for the joy that was set before him
[1543.12 --> 1546.12]  so that he might be able to gather
[1546.12 --> 1548.96]  the Jonas of this world in
[1548.96 --> 1552.38]  along with all the repentant people
[1552.38 --> 1555.04]  regardless of their background
[1555.04 --> 1557.56]  regardless of their color
[1557.56 --> 1559.96]  regardless of their language
[1559.96 --> 1561.60]  regardless of
[1561.60 --> 1563.02]  and you fill in the blank
[1563.02 --> 1565.06]  that I might gather
[1565.06 --> 1566.30]  for God so
[1566.30 --> 1567.24]  loved
[1567.24 --> 1568.36]  the world
[1568.36 --> 1571.12]  there is a
[1571.12 --> 1572.06]  commentator
[1572.06 --> 1573.28]  who says
[1573.28 --> 1574.58]  the book of Jonah
[1574.58 --> 1575.34]  was written
[1575.34 --> 1576.18]  by Jonah
[1576.18 --> 1576.74]  who told
[1576.74 --> 1577.72]  either by himself
[1577.72 --> 1579.08]  or who told the story
[1579.08 --> 1579.90]  to a secretary
[1579.90 --> 1581.02]  who wrote it down
[1581.02 --> 1583.10]  in order to share
[1583.10 --> 1583.94]  with his people
[1583.94 --> 1585.80]  that he got it
[1585.80 --> 1586.40]  in the end
[1586.40 --> 1587.78]  and that's why
[1587.78 --> 1588.80]  he shared the story
[1588.80 --> 1591.52]  that's a nice way
[1591.52 --> 1592.32]  to think about it
[1592.32 --> 1592.90]  I think
[1592.90 --> 1595.46]  but I want to ask
[1595.46 --> 1597.60]  what is your response
[1597.60 --> 1599.36]  as I need to ask
[1599.36 --> 1600.56]  what is my response
[1600.56 --> 1601.52]  to the quote
[1601.52 --> 1603.36]  probing question of God
[1603.36 --> 1608.32]  should I not be concerned
[1608.32 --> 1611.52]  and God's concerned
[1611.52 --> 1612.06]  for me
[1612.06 --> 1614.28]  he's concerned
[1614.28 --> 1614.86]  for you
[1614.86 --> 1617.24]  he sent his son
[1617.24 --> 1619.04]  so that we might
[1619.04 --> 1619.80]  call him
[1619.80 --> 1621.38]  our father
[1621.38 --> 1622.18]  let's pray
[1622.18 --> 1624.08]  father God
[1624.08 --> 1624.90]  we thank you
[1624.90 --> 1627.22]  thank you for the story
[1627.22 --> 1628.64]  and for all the thinking
[1628.64 --> 1629.46]  it provokes
[1629.46 --> 1630.44]  to us
[1630.44 --> 1631.32]  in our lives
[1631.32 --> 1633.38]  it is our prayer
[1633.38 --> 1634.02]  Lord God
[1634.02 --> 1634.62]  that as
[1634.62 --> 1635.88]  we reflect on it
[1635.88 --> 1636.92]  in days ahead
[1636.92 --> 1638.64]  that you would
[1638.64 --> 1639.72]  help us to see
[1639.72 --> 1640.38]  and understand
[1640.38 --> 1641.10]  the depth
[1641.10 --> 1641.94]  and the dimensions
[1641.94 --> 1643.50]  of your amazing grace
[1643.50 --> 1644.90]  and the fact
[1644.90 --> 1645.98]  that in Christ
[1645.98 --> 1647.50]  we are set free
[1647.50 --> 1648.58]  from all the chains
[1648.58 --> 1649.48]  that bind us
[1649.48 --> 1651.62]  we pray that we may
[1651.62 --> 1653.16]  grow into that freedom
[1653.16 --> 1654.96]  that we may become
[1654.96 --> 1656.34]  celebrative of it
[1656.34 --> 1658.14]  and that we may be able
[1658.14 --> 1658.86]  to demonstrate
[1658.86 --> 1659.64]  that freedom
[1659.64 --> 1661.14]  the attitudes
[1661.14 --> 1662.32]  and the behaviors
[1662.32 --> 1663.34]  that we have
[1663.34 --> 1665.46]  attitudes and behaviors
[1665.46 --> 1666.38]  that honor you
[1666.38 --> 1667.48]  and glorify Jesus
[1667.48 --> 1669.08]  for the great gift
[1669.08 --> 1670.16]  of amazing grace
[1670.16 --> 1671.46]  in his name we pray
[1671.46 --> 1673.00]  amen
[1673.00 --> 1675.40]  to give you特別
[1675.54 --> 1676.42]  upon
[1676.42 --> 1678.38]  shand
[1678.38 --> 1680.18]  and
[1680.18 --> 1682.26]  to
[1683.60 --> 1683.74]  listen
[1683.74 --> 1686.12]  to
[1688.78 --> 1689.16]  and
[1689.16 --> 1690.76]  you
