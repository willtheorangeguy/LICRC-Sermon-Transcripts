[0.00 --> 6.16]  Good morning, it's good to see you. My printer is out of ink, so that's why that's there.
[7.18 --> 12.18]  And originally, I was told that I have to be stationary this morning,
[12.74 --> 18.18]  because there's a camera, and so I thought I wasn't going to be here. Actually, I was going
[18.18 --> 24.20]  to decline this whole invitation, because I can't do that. But I was told I actually have four feet
[24.20 --> 31.68]  this way. So, can you tell me, when am I out? Still more? Oh, wow, this is normal. Oh, perfect.
[31.82 --> 42.56]  Okay, good, I got that. We're going to look at what I believe God is calling the church to during this
[42.56 --> 51.18]  global crisis that we find ourselves in. Because I do think that when we look at what's taking place
[51.18 --> 59.10]  in our world regarding COVID and the protocol and the different lifestyle that we have all been
[59.10 --> 69.10]  required to live. And then, in conjunction with the racial tension that exists within our world today,
[69.56 --> 78.02]  of course, primarily with our neighbors to the south, who we must pray for during this time,
[78.02 --> 89.06]  and all of the civil unrest and all of the social unrest coming on the heels of this COVID-19 protocol,
[90.04 --> 96.60]  Christians around the world are asking, God, I feel that I'm a little loud. Just going to throw
[96.60 --> 104.44]  that out there. God, what are you calling the church to do? How should we respond? Perhaps we need
[104.44 --> 113.12]  to blog more. Perhaps we need to join Black Lives Matter. Perhaps we need to just, you know, stay home.
[113.54 --> 121.46]  Don't do anything. Follow the protocol, isolation, COVID thing, and just do a whole lot of what are we
[121.46 --> 128.16]  supposed to do? And I'm convinced that what we're talking about this morning is step one. Without
[128.16 --> 136.80]  question, this is step one. 2 Chronicles 7, 14. On the heels of a crisis, when that was being written,
[137.20 --> 146.68]  it says, and if my people who are called by my name would humble themselves, turn from their wicked ways,
[147.62 --> 158.02]  seek my face, and what? And pray. Then I will hear from heaven, and I will heal their land.
[158.16 --> 166.82]  Well, this is our prayer. We have far more insidious problems in our world than COVID-19. I loved how that
[166.82 --> 171.22]  was addressed, though that's not exactly how you put it, John, but that's what you were getting at.
[171.98 --> 180.70]  And it is our call from God due to the crisis. As C.S. Lewis said, pain is God's megaphone to rouse a
[180.70 --> 188.34]  dying world. And so with all that in mind, we're going to look at Matthew chapter 6. Not sure if
[188.34 --> 192.86]  you're going to have it up there or not. That's fine if you don't. Matthew chapter 6. The disciples
[192.86 --> 201.56]  noticed something about Jesus. They noticed that he spent a lot of time praying. They noticed that he
[201.56 --> 211.88]  would go away from them to be by himself. And he did it a lot. And so on one occasion, upon seeing him
[211.88 --> 221.12]  pray, they said, Lord, teach us to pray. And so Jesus taught them to pray. And he said this,
[221.12 --> 231.02]  when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray, standing in synagogues and on
[231.02 --> 238.04]  street corners in order, excuse me, in order to be seen by others.
[240.72 --> 245.00]  That's not COVID water, by the way. That was just put there before the service, so don't worry.
[245.00 --> 252.50]  Truly I tell you, they have received their reward. Okay, the hypocrite prayer. They like to be seen
[252.50 --> 258.80]  by others. But when you pray, go into your room, close the door, and pray to your Father who is
[258.80 --> 264.78]  unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. I'm just going to pause
[264.78 --> 269.66]  there. Actually, it's the word secret that is used twice. But when you pray, go to your room, close the
[269.66 --> 275.52]  door, and pray to your Father who is in secret. Okay, the word is crypto in Greek, in fact, which
[275.52 --> 282.54]  is where we get our word cryptic from. Something that's done in a confined and solitary location.
[282.68 --> 287.42]  That's kind of what Jesus is getting at, though of course we pray as community as well. Pray to your
[287.42 --> 293.54]  Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you. And when you
[293.54 --> 301.80]  pray, don't babble like pagans, for they think that they're going to be heard by their God because of
[301.80 --> 308.14]  their eloquent words. Don't be like them. Your Father knows what you need before you ask Him. Do you
[308.14 --> 316.08]  think you can impress Him with your words? This then is how you should pray. Our Father in heaven,
[316.68 --> 323.42]  hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today
[323.42 --> 329.76]  our daily bread. Forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into
[329.76 --> 342.44]  temptation, but deliver us from evil. My life actually in this COVID environment, in fact, hasn't
[342.44 --> 348.70]  changed one iota. I work for the Salvation Army, as many of you know, and we oversee quite a project
[348.70 --> 353.40]  there in Abbotsford with a lot of street entrenched people who we're working with and people
[353.40 --> 358.54]  who are living on the cusp of homelessness. And so we work hard to keep them housed, as well as
[358.54 --> 363.54]  working with homeless people. And so it's an essential service. I'm still going. I'm teaching
[363.54 --> 370.20]  online humanities. It's online, so that's still going. And so life hasn't changed a lot for me in
[370.20 --> 376.78]  that regard, except for, of course, we are and have established COVID protocol, which we maintain
[376.78 --> 382.98]  at the Salvation Army. And what we're noticing during this particular COVID period is that our
[382.98 --> 388.92]  homeless people have a lot more money. Isn't that interesting? Many of the homeless people are
[388.92 --> 396.54]  receiving the CERB. So please pray for the liberal government. Because giving a homeless person $2,000
[396.54 --> 405.06]  with the idea that one day you'll audit and you will be able to recoup funds that has been
[405.06 --> 412.90]  indiscriminately distributed across our country means the jokes on you. Because you're not getting
[412.90 --> 419.62]  that money back. And I saw two weeks ago, I saw a man named, a boy named Jeremy Trellenberg, 30 years
[419.62 --> 426.10]  old. I watched him die before my eyes because he's got too much money in his pocket, too many drugs that
[426.10 --> 434.50]  he's using. And it finally killed him. There are more deaths by overdose in British Columbia than COVID
[434.50 --> 441.28]  since January 1. And to some degree, our government is responsible for that because they're putting too
[441.28 --> 448.10]  much money in the hands of people who cannot handle these kinds of funds. They're not ready for it.
[448.94 --> 453.96]  This is the world in which we're living right now. And then we turn our attention to what's going on
[453.96 --> 462.94]  down south and the civil unrest, the racial tension, white police officers killing black men.
[463.72 --> 470.84]  And in response, police officers getting murdered in the United States right now. And we're not sure
[470.84 --> 478.72]  what we're supposed to do. We live in a world where insanity seems to rule. But it's not the first
[478.72 --> 483.78]  time this has taken place. And here's what I would like to draw your attention to. There's another
[483.78 --> 492.48]  place in Scripture where insanity follows a self-absorbed narcissistic personality disorder.
[492.98 --> 498.06]  And I believe our culture, generally speaking, is certainly the most narcissistic probably in the
[498.06 --> 504.40]  history of the world. Narcissism has to do with those who are absolutely self-absorbed. And we used to
[504.40 --> 510.28]  joke about the selfie and the self-focus that our culture lives in. And to some degree, now we are
[510.28 --> 516.36]  seeing the consequences of a narcissistic lifestyle in regard to how we're responding to what's taking
[516.36 --> 522.86]  place in the world today. Narcissism is a focus on self to the exclusion of others.
[523.72 --> 529.94]  Secularism, from the Latin word saeculum, which means present. Secularism, do you realize by definition,
[530.40 --> 537.30]  means simply now-ism. It means simply to live in the present without consideration of the past
[537.30 --> 545.06]  and without consideration of the future. And this is what's taking place. We have this
[545.06 --> 553.18]  combination of narcissism and secularism in this cultural moment. And it's happened before.
[553.48 --> 559.28]  There was a man named Nebuchadnezzar. Nebuchadnezzar was like Donald Trump on steroids. Donald Trump,
[559.50 --> 565.66]  all he's got, other than a very big mouth, is... And man, I'm not even getting into American politics.
[565.66 --> 569.72]  I don't even mean to say that because, boy, I don't even know where you... I don't even want to comment.
[569.88 --> 574.76]  But what a mess, right? I mean, what a mess. I don't... I have opinions on everything.
[575.12 --> 576.42]  But I don't even know what to say about that.
[578.48 --> 583.54]  But there's a... Nebuchadnezzar was Donald Trump on steroids. All Donald Trump has is his Trump
[583.54 --> 589.76]  towers and a big mouth. Nebuchadnezzar also had a big mouth. He walked around having people worship
[589.76 --> 595.92]  him and he walked around his palace and his gardens and he had the hanging gardens of Babylon.
[596.38 --> 603.12]  That's Nebuchadnezzar's thing. One of the seven wonders of the ancient world. And on one occasion,
[603.56 --> 610.52]  he was walking around his palace and saying, look at the splendor of my glory. And look at all that I
[610.52 --> 617.04]  have accomplished for myself. I am the most powerful human being on the face of the earth
[617.04 --> 622.08]  with the largest military and the largest city and the most technologically advanced
[622.08 --> 630.18]  palace on the face of the planet. Look how great I am. And as those words were on his lips,
[630.38 --> 640.30]  do you know what happened to him? Insanity. Narcissism leads to insanity, my friends. And do we not see
[640.30 --> 647.40]  that in our culture today? And it didn't end until finally he raised his eyes to heaven.
[648.06 --> 654.38]  Here's the call of the church, a call of God to the church, that we would raise our eyes to the
[654.38 --> 660.94]  heavens on behalf of our culture, which is losing its sanity. And he says, at the end of the days,
[660.94 --> 667.50]  I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted my eyes to heaven and then my sanity was returned to me. I blessed the most
[667.50 --> 672.96]  high God and praised and honored him who lives forever. For his dominion is an everlasting dominion,
[673.02 --> 678.10]  regardless of what it looks like on the streets of Seattle. And his kingdom endures from generation
[678.10 --> 683.38]  to generation, regardless of the fact that the kingdoms of our world are crumbling before our
[683.38 --> 688.90]  eyes. All the inhabitants of the earth are regarded as nothing and compared to his glory.
[688.90 --> 697.22]  And he does as he will according to his, according to the host of heaven. None can stay his hand or say
[697.22 --> 705.62]  to him, what have you done? And when I said that, King Nebuchadnezzar says, my sanity was restored to me.
[706.54 --> 710.46]  This is a call to prayer. Now I'm not going to go through the entire Lord's Prayer. We're actually
[710.46 --> 715.60]  just going to look at the introduction today. Three points really simply. This is all that Jesus is
[715.60 --> 721.86]  getting at as he introduces. When he's teaching us to pray, the first thing he says is, this is where
[721.86 --> 728.32]  you pray. It's literally that important to Jesus that when he teaches us to pray, he teaches us where
[728.32 --> 735.02]  to go and spends a significant amount of time on teaching us where to go to pray. And then he teaches
[735.02 --> 743.96]  us how not to pray before he teaches us how to pray. And from this is inferred the foundation of our
[743.96 --> 749.28]  prayer. Okay, so the first thing that Jesus does, he says, when you pray, okay, don't pray like the
[749.28 --> 754.34]  hypocrite, don't pray like the pagan. We'll get there in a minute. He says, go to your room. And notice he
[754.34 --> 761.16]  says, close the door behind you. What's Jesus getting at? Right at the outset, he's getting at the most
[761.16 --> 768.60]  practical dimension of our need to pray. And probably the primary reason why many of us don't pray is we
[768.60 --> 773.76]  ought. And by the way, this is all of us. Every time I speak on prayer, I feel like a hypocrite, which I'm about to
[773.76 --> 780.32]  talk about in a minute. I'll explain to you what that means. But why don't we pray well? Here's what
[780.32 --> 784.98]  Jesus is saying, is because you don't get a silent location. And he's not simply talking about a
[784.98 --> 789.36]  location for the sake of a location. I mean, when my kids were young, I spent, and I had to pray, I just
[789.36 --> 793.80]  spent more time in the bathroom. And I know some of you have that same situation, because when you have
[793.80 --> 798.96]  young kids and it's hard to find silence, but here's the point that Jesus is making, is that we need
[798.96 --> 807.60]  to learn to focus. We need to learn to concentrate. We need to learn to look to the heavens and pray to
[807.60 --> 814.98]  our Father who is in heaven. And in order to do so, he says, we go to our room and we close the door.
[815.30 --> 822.36]  And so do you have that location in your life? And have you bracketed out the time in your life?
[822.36 --> 831.48]  Because this is the most important thing in your life. Do you have time to pray? And I know we talk
[831.48 --> 835.36]  about praying on the way to work, and I pray on the way to work. And we talk about praying on the
[835.36 --> 840.34]  way home from work, and I pray on the way home from work. Paul says that we must pray without ceasing,
[840.54 --> 845.94]  and to be sure, we must pray without ceasing. This isn't the only thing the Bible says about prayer,
[846.02 --> 851.30]  but this is God come in the flesh talking to us about prayer. And he says that although all of that
[851.30 --> 859.02]  is absolutely important, there is something about you bracketing out that time in your day and on a
[859.02 --> 867.86]  daily basis to be alone, quiet before the Lord without your phone and all of its notifications
[867.86 --> 877.76]  and all of its distractions. Nicholas Carr has a great book called The Shallows. Has anyone heard of it?
[877.76 --> 885.78]  It's The Shallows, subtitled What the Internet is Doing to Our Brain. Nicholas Carr won a Pulitzer Prize for
[885.78 --> 889.98]  this book. I highly recommend it, in fact. And he's got a bunch of friends who have PhDs and they're
[889.98 --> 896.18]  doctors, and he's in conversation with them. And Nicholas Carr is noticing that many of them are
[896.18 --> 903.14]  saying, you know, I just don't read anymore. I don't read lengthy treaties anymore. I don't even like
[903.14 --> 909.14]  reading long blog posts. I like the short blog posts. Tweets are best, actually, because you can really get
[909.14 --> 914.62]  that little piece of information really fast. And people, and why not? And they're saying, because I can't hold
[914.62 --> 923.98]  my concentration long enough. And so all of this is an attack, ultimately, on prayer. Because if you can't
[923.98 --> 932.42]  concentrate for longer than five minutes, you cannot pray. And this is what Jesus is saying.
[933.38 --> 938.38]  Right? And I got ADD. I mean, I feel sorry for people who don't have ADD. ADD's fun. You've got to
[938.38 --> 943.34]  channel your ADD. By the way, it stands for Attention Deficit. Man, I really don't like the shirt that I'm
[943.34 --> 952.90]  wearing today. It's flopping around. And not everyone gets that. And so I do, you know,
[953.00 --> 960.30]  our Father who art in heaven, did I forget to turn off the stove? Hallowed be thy name. Your kingdom come,
[960.64 --> 965.00]  man, are my children suffering right? And you're going to notice when you go in this prayer, here's
[965.00 --> 970.74]  the concentration. Notice this prayer. We go to prayer with a shopping list of requests.
[970.74 --> 979.60]  Christ's prayer, our Father in heaven. He is your dad. By his spirit, you can't cry, Abba, Father.
[979.74 --> 985.60]  In heaven, to the Jew, meant he was in control. Psalm 115, 3, our God is in heaven. He does whatever
[985.60 --> 991.22]  he pleases. Psalm 135, 6, our God is in heaven. He does whatever he pleases. Daniel 4, our God is in
[991.22 --> 995.28]  heaven. The peoples of the earth are regarded as nothing, and he does as he pleases, and no one can
[995.28 --> 1002.64]  hold back his hand. To say our God is in heaven is to assert that no one can hold back his hand,
[1002.68 --> 1007.58]  and he's in charge regardless of what things look like. This is how you start your prayer.
[1008.32 --> 1015.58]  And then you're saying, hallowed be thy name. That means may God's holiness be manifested in my life.
[1015.58 --> 1022.30]  God is hallowed, holy. May he be regarded as holy in my life, in my family, in my marriage,
[1022.86 --> 1027.28]  in my church, where I work, and ultimately in this world.
[1029.18 --> 1033.22]  What is Jesus doing? When we pray, we go to prayer with all of our problems.
[1034.18 --> 1038.58]  We pray our problems so much, we're more depressed by the end of our prayer than we were at the beginning
[1038.58 --> 1044.60]  of the prayer. Because all we do in prayer is pray our problems. And Jesus is saying, that's not how you pray.
[1044.60 --> 1048.80]  And of course there's the emergency prayer, and I understand. There's something that's an emergency,
[1049.24 --> 1052.72]  and the first thing you do is you go to God and you bring it to him. And I understand that,
[1052.78 --> 1056.34]  and we need to do that. And there's places in the Bible where that happens. But Jesus is teaching,
[1056.46 --> 1061.72]  this is generally speaking, how you pray. When you pray, pray this way. By the way, I'm not even
[1061.72 --> 1067.10]  gone through the Lord's prayer yet. Hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come. All my life I walk around
[1067.10 --> 1071.56]  thinking about my kingdom, my empire, my achievements, the things I'm accomplishing. And he's saying,
[1071.56 --> 1076.44]  no, no, no, no, I'm pushing against that. I'm into my kingdom, not your kingdom. And while the kingdoms
[1076.44 --> 1081.88]  of the world are collapsing, you need to pray for my kingdom to come. And I go to prayer with my will.
[1081.96 --> 1088.34]  Lord, this is what I want. This is what I think I need. These are my problems. Please solve them.
[1088.34 --> 1097.72]  And he says, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. And my mind is just going, hang on a minute.
[1097.96 --> 1104.04]  And if you start praying this way, it will transform your life. And you know how? Because you're taking
[1104.04 --> 1108.06]  your eyes off of yourself in prayer. Because that's what prayer is supposed to be, by the way. By
[1108.06 --> 1114.64]  definition, this selfie culture needs nothing more than to take their eyes off of themselves. Stop
[1114.64 --> 1120.26]  video recording every silly, stupid thing that happens. Stop taking pictures of your dumb breakfast
[1120.26 --> 1131.38]  and start focusing on someone else. And this is what Jesus is saying. Go to a room. Be by yourself.
[1131.78 --> 1141.84]  And don't bring your phone and all of its irritating notifications. And pray. When you pray,
[1141.84 --> 1152.22]  the first thing Jesus says is where to go when you pray. John Piper said one of the great uses of Twitter
[1152.22 --> 1160.58]  and Facebook will be to prove at the last day that prayerlessness was not from a lack of time.
[1161.64 --> 1168.28]  In order to pray, we need to find a silent location. Prayer begins, Jesus says, not with our Father who is in
[1168.28 --> 1178.72]  heaven, but our Father who is in secret. Second, he says, when you pray, don't pray like the hypocrite,
[1179.50 --> 1185.42]  for they love to pray standing to be seen by others. And don't pray like the pagan. Okay, again,
[1185.48 --> 1191.08]  we're not even at how to pray yet. Jesus is still busy telling us how not to pray. And this is
[1191.08 --> 1198.66]  absolutely crucial because this is going to lead to our last point this morning. But how not to pray?
[1199.74 --> 1204.18]  Don't pray like a hypocrite and don't pray like a pagan. Well, what is it about the hypocrite prayer
[1204.18 --> 1208.32]  and what is it about the pagan prayer? First of all, the assumption here is that hypocrites pray
[1208.32 --> 1214.18]  and that pagans pray. And the assumption here in that Jesus is talking to his disciples
[1214.18 --> 1221.64]  is that disciples of Jesus can pray like hypocrites. And disciples of Jesus can pray like pagans.
[1222.08 --> 1227.98]  I can honestly tell you that the first 10 or 15 years of my Christian life, I was praying like a
[1227.98 --> 1234.28]  pagan. And I'll explain that to you in a moment. First of all, he says, when you pray, don't pray like
[1234.28 --> 1240.50]  a hypocrite. The word hypocrite has a fascinating etymology development evolution of this word.
[1240.50 --> 1251.18]  It used to refer to a stage actor in pre-Christ Greek theater. And so a stage actor was a hypocrite.
[1251.72 --> 1256.88]  And it simply means someone who wears a mask. Okay, so that's what a hypocrite was. And of course,
[1257.04 --> 1264.26]  in theater 2,500 years ago, the actors would simply wear masks. A mask that would have a very large smile
[1264.26 --> 1271.48]  to show the facial expression of the actor and the theme and mood of the moment. Or a mask that was very large
[1271.48 --> 1277.30]  that had a very large frown to show the opposite facial expression and emotion and so forth. So that the people
[1277.30 --> 1283.28]  in the theater, and the theaters were quite large, could know exactly what the actor was feeling, their emotion.
[1283.82 --> 1290.36]  A hypocrite is someone who wears a mask. And of course, we can see the development of the word hypocrite in that
[1290.36 --> 1295.56]  now. Of course, it means, and then, by the way, this is what Jesus meant. It meant someone who's pretentious,
[1295.70 --> 1302.96]  someone who pretends to be something that they're not. And when we do that, we do it in order to try to win
[1302.96 --> 1309.58]  their approval. A hypocrite is an approval suck. A hypocrite is someone who needs the approval of other
[1309.58 --> 1316.68]  people in order to validate themselves. And ultimately, because they don't have a deep and abiding sense
[1316.68 --> 1323.26]  of the approval that they have with the God of the universe. And that's what Jesus is getting at here
[1323.26 --> 1328.52]  when he says, when you pray, don't pray like this. Here's what he's saying. He's saying, when you pray,
[1328.82 --> 1335.22]  pray with the approval that you have. And he'll get to that in a minute. And he says, then, don't pray
[1335.22 --> 1340.14]  like a pagan. Well, how does a pagan pray? If a hypocrite prays to impress other people, a pagan's praying
[1340.14 --> 1349.18]  to impress God. So a pagan thinks that the God he or she is praying to, and in this case, where Jesus is
[1349.18 --> 1354.60]  talking to his disciples, we're praying to the real God, we think, when we're praying like a pagan, that the real
[1354.60 --> 1363.30]  God we're praying to is hearing us because we're impressive with our words. Surely he's hearing me because
[1363.30 --> 1370.24]  I've been impressive with my life. I don't know if you've read Homer's Iliad or any Greek mythology,
[1370.62 --> 1376.58]  but pagans prayed all the time. And Homer's Iliad and Odyssey is full of pagan prayers. There's one
[1376.58 --> 1382.06]  occasion where there's a woman named Thetis who's Achilles' mother, and she's aware of the fact that
[1382.06 --> 1389.70]  Achilles is in danger. And so she goes to pray to the sky god Apollo who dwells on Mount Olympus.
[1389.70 --> 1399.88]  And she says to him, O Father Jove, if I have ever done anything good for you in word or deed,
[1400.54 --> 1408.92]  hear my prayer. Right? That's a classic pagan prayer. You say, well, I don't pray like that.
[1409.60 --> 1414.78]  Okay, here's how I used to pray like a pagan. I used to go to God in prayer, and the very first thing I
[1414.78 --> 1419.86]  did, when I was a new Christian, I was a new Christian. And so, I mean, I was quite a nasty
[1419.86 --> 1426.08]  non-Christian, and so I kind of had a lot of things to work out, like bad language and drinking.
[1427.36 --> 1430.84]  Anyway, I won't get into all that, but I'll tell you, I was glad there wasn't video recorders
[1430.84 --> 1436.72]  running around all the time when I was 18 years old, I can tell you that. Anyway, it was a joke. You can
[1436.72 --> 1442.10]  laugh. I wasn't that bad. I mean, I shouldn't be in jail or anything. I've not killed anybody
[1442.10 --> 1451.90]  as far as I know. And so, when I prayed, I would always have to begin with the confession of my sin.
[1453.72 --> 1460.46]  Jesus died for me. Christ died. Rose again. Conquered sin, death, and hell. Colossians 2 says that my sin
[1460.46 --> 1467.02]  was nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more. Yet, I would have to begin with my sin because I didn't
[1467.02 --> 1475.66]  believe that God could hear my prayer unless I confessed sin first. Or there were times where I
[1475.66 --> 1480.74]  just would live in guilt, and if I was kind of having a bad sin week, I didn't think I could really
[1480.74 --> 1485.92]  go to God in prayer. I had to first kind of have a couple of days where I'm not struggling so much
[1485.92 --> 1491.82]  with that particular sin. Now, I want to go to the Lord's Prayer. There's six petitions in the Lord's
[1491.82 --> 1497.22]  Prayer. Our Father who art in heaven, that's an address. Hallowed be your name. That's a request.
[1497.32 --> 1502.36]  That's a prayer request. That's a petition. Your kingdom come. That's a prayer request.
[1503.22 --> 1509.12]  Your will be done. That's a prayer request. Give us this day our daily bread. Okay, that's a prayer
[1509.12 --> 1514.90]  request. Guess where the location of the confession is on the list of prayer requests in the Lord's
[1514.90 --> 1523.00]  Prayer when Jesus teaches you to pray. It's absolutely remarkable. When I pray, I have to deal
[1523.00 --> 1528.90]  with my sin first because I think God won't hear me unless I deal with my sin first. When Jesus teaches
[1528.90 --> 1537.18]  me to pray, he locates the confession of sin on the fifth out of six petitions showing that the basis of
[1537.18 --> 1546.94]  our prayer is not how good we've lived or how well we've confessed or how pure we feel before the Father.
[1548.94 --> 1555.98]  Right? And if you're not praying this way, Jesus is saying this, you're praying like a pagan.
[1557.10 --> 1562.54]  You really think he's hearing you better when you're feeling better about yourself?
[1562.54 --> 1570.00]  Do you really think that God is in heaven looking at your life and seeing that you sinned maybe a
[1570.00 --> 1575.84]  little bit less this week than last week and so your prayers will be more effective based on the
[1575.84 --> 1583.64]  fact that you've sinned a little this week, a little less this week than last week? That is paganism.
[1584.60 --> 1591.74]  This is the point that Jesus is making. Don't pray like a pagan who thinks they're heard on the basis of
[1591.74 --> 1598.14]  their life. Pray like a Christian who knows they're heard on the basis of Christ's life.
[1599.10 --> 1604.70]  And so that then leads us to the last point, the foundation of our prayer.
[1606.36 --> 1610.60]  Don't pray to win the approval of others, which shows you don't live in the approval of God. Don't
[1610.60 --> 1615.20]  pray like a pagan in order to win God's approval, which shows that you think he hears you because
[1615.20 --> 1627.50]  you've been good. Rather, he says, pray our father. He is your father in Christ. And by his spirit,
[1627.66 --> 1635.98]  we call cry Abba. And therefore, we're no longer slaves, but we're children of God. And we pray as
[1635.98 --> 1643.64]  children of God. There's someone who's, I don't know who said this, but who can actually wake
[1643.64 --> 1650.56]  the most powerful monarch up in the middle of the night simply to ask for a drink of water.
[1651.84 --> 1658.78]  But his child. Anyone else loses their head. But we are children of God.
[1662.00 --> 1667.02]  Dietrich Bonhoeffer has a wonderful book, the prayer book of the Bible, and he says this,
[1667.02 --> 1674.74]  the prayer book of the Bible, the Psalms. Read the Psalms, and you'll find how theologically astute
[1674.74 --> 1681.90]  they are in regard to this teaching. There are fewer prayers for the forgiveness of sins
[1681.90 --> 1689.06]  in the Psalms than we might expect, he says. Most Psalms, in fact, presuppose complete certainty of the
[1689.06 --> 1694.34]  forgiveness of sins. Christian prayer, he says, is diminished and endangered when it revolves
[1694.34 --> 1700.10]  exclusively around the forgiveness of sins. There is such a thing as confidently leaving your sin
[1700.10 --> 1705.62]  behind for the sake of Christ. Indeed, it may be troubling, he says, that in the Psalms,
[1705.96 --> 1714.00]  the righteousness of the author is spoken of as often as his guilt. Have you ever noticed that?
[1714.58 --> 1721.36]  Here's a small sampling. Psalm 5, you bless the righteous. 17, I in righteousness will see his face.
[1721.36 --> 1727.90]  34, his eyes are on the righteous. 37, I've never seen the righteous forsaken. Psalm 64, let the righteous
[1727.90 --> 1736.82]  rejoice. 68, let the righteous be glad. How often do you appeal to your righteousness in prayer?
[1739.98 --> 1744.66]  Not a righteousness that you've earned, but a righteousness that has been given to you by God
[1744.66 --> 1752.20]  through Christ based on his life. How often do you appeal to your righteousness in prayer?
[1752.20 --> 1757.44]  And have we ever considered the possibility that perhaps our weakness in prayer is owing to the fact
[1757.44 --> 1764.00]  that we give much more time to our guilt in prayer than we do to our righteousness? The prayer does not
[1764.00 --> 1773.16]  begin with the confession of sin. The prayer begins, our Father, you have made me righteous and I am your Son.
[1773.16 --> 1789.34]  This is the foundation to our prayer. This is also the foundation to the Lord's table.
[1789.34 --> 1800.80]  Because we do the same thing at the table. We think in order to come to the table, we have to make sure
[1800.80 --> 1808.12]  we've lived a pretty sinless life. We don't want to come to the table if there's sin in our lives. We
[1808.12 --> 1812.98]  need to deal with all that. And of course, Paul did talk about the table and unity in the church,
[1813.08 --> 1817.68]  and there was fighting, and there was some people who were eating all the food and not leaving any for
[1817.68 --> 1822.62]  anyone else. And he's talking about how those things needed to be resolved within the church for the
[1822.62 --> 1829.68]  sake of unity in the church. But sin is not a reason to not come to the table. My friends, sin is the
[1829.68 --> 1840.36]  reason you do come to the table. And so if you're struggling with sin this morning, and by the looks of
[1840.36 --> 1851.88]  you, you all are, if you struggle with sin in your life, we're going to come to the table. We're going to
[1851.88 --> 1858.72]  confess our sin, to be sure. But we're going to come to the table, and we are going to partake.
[1859.28 --> 1866.28]  And we are going to consider all that Christ has done on our behalf. For this is a reminder of his
[1866.28 --> 1873.72]  death, which was for our sin, his life, which earned our righteousness. And we're going to think about
[1873.72 --> 1879.50]  the great grace of God, which he has conferred to us through Christ. And so we're going to sing
[1879.50 --> 1887.36]  amazing grace, I believe, right now. And then we will partake of the bread and the wine.
[1887.36 --> 1899.58]  As the team comes forward. Gracious Father, we thank you for all that you've done for us in Christ. We
[1899.58 --> 1904.92]  thank you that we can come to you in prayer, and we can call you Father. Yes, we confess sin.
[1906.42 --> 1913.10]  But we don't want to be remembering sin and reminding you of all this sin that you have forgiven us of,
[1913.10 --> 1919.84]  and focusing on it to the neglect of the righteousness of Christ. Father, we are sinners,
[1919.84 --> 1926.38]  and we come with our sin to you this morning. But we thank you for the righteousness that is ours in
[1926.38 --> 1930.14]  Christ. Your grace is amazing. Amen.
