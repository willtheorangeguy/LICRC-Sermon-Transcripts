[0.00 → 6.60] So today, I don't get to preach every week, of course.
[6.70 → 8.14] I kind of come and go a little bit.
[8.20 → 11.24] Every few weeks I pop up here, and so it's hard to maybe get some rhythm in,
[11.28 → 13.86] so I have to think of what I'm going to preach on kind of sporadically.
[14.00 → 16.60] And today I knew that the kids were going to be doing Moses in the Burning Bush,
[16.66 → 18.98] so I thought, hey, why not just do the same thing?
[19.22 → 21.28] Why try to think too creatively about it?
[21.28 → 23.12] It's a really, huge story.
[23.12 → 26.20] It's one that we've all heard before because we just did it a second ago,
[26.20 → 29.82] and I thought, you know what, let's dig into it a little bit further.
[30.26 → 33.94] So we're going to do this without the help of a wrinkly blue old dog at the end of my arm,
[34.36 → 36.68] and we're going to look at this passage right now.
[37.26 → 41.82] It is a bit of a fascinating story, and it's a bit of a big story as well.
[42.74 → 47.30] But even though it is a popular story and a big story, there is a ton to unpack in it,
[47.84 → 50.66] and so I thought that we could spend some time looking at that today.
[50.66 → 57.34] There's enough in this passage, actually, that you could spend weeks and weeks and weeks on it,
[58.34 → 61.28] but we don't have weeks and weeks and weeks, so we're just going to really dig in for,
[61.48 → 64.78] we're going to spend the next few hours just, you know, tackling Moses here.
[64.98 → 67.48] So, just kidding, it's like barely over an hour.
[68.78 → 73.14] My hope is that you can find in this familiar story something new and something creative.
[73.32 → 75.52] I'm hearing a real high. Is that my mic?
[76.30 → 79.02] It's my voice? Okay, Eric's just shaking his head.
[79.02 → 82.16] We might just have to deal with a little bit of technical difficulty. Sorry about that.
[83.46 → 86.74] So, on the screen behind me, if you've got your Bibles in front of you, open up.
[86.76 → 91.06] We're going to look at Exodus 3, the first 12 verses of Exodus 3 today.
[91.78 → 94.70] You'll notice if you do open your Bibles, the story's much longer than that,
[94.78 → 97.24] but like I said, we're just going to hone in on sort of these first 12 verses,
[97.36 → 99.04] because there's enough there for us to look at.
[99.86 → 102.44] So, Exodus 3, the first 12 verses, it says this.
[103.44 → 108.86] Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Median.
[109.02 → 114.90] And he led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.
[115.80 → 120.12] There the angel of the Lord appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush.
[121.12 → 125.06] Moses saw that though the bush was on fire, it did not burn up.
[125.88 → 129.04] So Moses thought, I will go over and see this strange sight.
[129.12 → 130.34] Why the bush does not burn up?
[130.34 → 135.16] When the Lord saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush,
[135.68 → 137.60] Moses, Moses.
[138.80 → 141.50] And Moses said, here I am.
[142.64 → 144.80] Do not come any closer, God said.
[144.90 → 148.66] Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.
[149.92 → 152.02] Then he said, I am the God of your father,
[152.48 → 155.46] the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
[155.46 → 161.88] At this, Moses hid his face because he was afraid to look at God.
[163.08 → 166.52] The Lord said, I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt.
[166.64 → 169.00] I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers,
[169.20 → 170.90] and I am concerned about their suffering.
[171.02 → 174.22] So I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians
[174.22 → 178.98] and to bring them out of that land into a good and spacious land,
[179.30 → 181.78] a land flowing with milk and honey,
[182.68 → 187.44] the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Ammonites, Perizzites, Divides, and Websites.
[189.08 → 191.32] And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me,
[191.36 → 193.74] and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them.
[194.40 → 199.60] So now go, I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people, the Israelites, out of Egypt.
[199.60 → 205.32] But Moses said to God, Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?
[206.28 → 208.36] And God said, I will be with you,
[208.80 → 212.32] and this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you.
[212.90 → 214.74] When you have brought the people out of Egypt,
[215.14 → 218.38] you will worship God on this mountain.
[219.08 → 220.14] The word of the Lord.
[222.48 → 224.46] Now, as with everything in the Bible,
[224.80 → 228.18] this is a little story in the midst of a giant story.
[228.18 → 232.62] And while the burning bush story sort of stands on its own in terms of intrigue
[232.62 → 234.04] and in terms of magnitude,
[234.04 → 237.80] it's placed in this grand narrative of Scripture.
[238.20 → 241.80] And it's important to be reminded, or perhaps even hear for the first time,
[242.22 → 246.62] how this event fits into this big story of Scripture.
[247.26 → 248.40] And so, strap yourselves in.
[248.62 → 251.70] I'm going to get us there in about 400 words or fewer,
[251.88 → 253.02] how the Bible gets us here.
[253.10 → 256.80] So, as you've been hearing with Pastor Burt over the past few weeks,
[256.80 → 258.50] we've been talking about this man, Joseph.
[258.90 → 263.26] Well, this story takes place right after the story of Joseph in the Bible.
[263.64 → 266.52] And without purposefully ruining the end of Pastor Burt's sermon series,
[267.02 → 269.98] Joseph, who is the son of Jacob, who is the son of Isaac,
[270.10 → 272.78] who is the son of Abraham, gets sold into slavery
[272.78 → 276.00] and eventually becomes this high-ranking official in Egypt.
[277.10 → 279.82] After he interprets this dream of Pharaoh teaching,
[279.96 → 282.84] or prophesying, sorry, about this famine that's going to be hitting Egypt,
[282.84 → 286.60] he gets put in charge of all the harvest
[286.60 → 288.60] and of all the food within Egypt,
[288.72 → 291.56] making sure that Egypt will be in a good place when this famine hits.
[292.02 → 294.56] Now, because of this famine, Joseph's extended family,
[294.72 → 296.20] which was about 70 people,
[296.64 → 300.08] actually moves to Egypt for all the food that is there.
[300.24 → 301.92] And they end up reuniting with Joseph
[301.92 → 304.78] and living there for a very long time.
[305.54 → 307.34] Now, while in the Bible the story of Moses
[307.34 → 309.14] immediately follows the story of Joseph,
[309.14 → 312.20] in fact, about 400 years go by.
[312.72 → 315.46] And in that time, numerous generations, of course, pass.
[315.54 → 317.60] And over the course of those 400 years,
[318.04 → 322.34] Joseph's family of 70 grows massively.
[322.88 → 324.96] In 400 years, that family of 70
[324.96 → 329.96] grows to a family of 600,000 soldier-aged men,
[330.60 → 333.76] which we read about in Exodus 12, verse 37.
[334.50 → 337.96] So that's 600,000 soldier-aged men.
[337.96 → 340.50] And if you included the women and the children
[340.50 → 342.28] and the non-soldier-aged men,
[342.46 → 344.00] we're talking about a group of people
[344.00 → 346.18] that's probably well over 2 million.
[346.50 → 349.02] That's a lot, and that is a very fertile family.
[349.94 → 351.28] Now, over that time,
[351.46 → 353.50] pharaohs have also come and gone, of course.
[353.84 → 356.62] And eventually, they kind of forget about Joseph
[356.62 → 357.70] and all he did for them.
[357.74 → 359.06] And they forget about this family
[359.06 → 362.06] that's now grown into this giant number of people.
[362.36 → 363.94] They grow increasingly worried
[363.94 → 365.50] and end up enslaving them
[365.50 → 368.06] and eventually command that all Hebrew boys
[368.06 → 370.60] that are born be cast into the Nile River and killed.
[371.26 → 373.44] Well, Moses is born in that time.
[373.94 → 375.28] And Moses' mother saves him
[375.28 → 376.28] by putting him in a basket,
[376.42 → 377.40] floating him down the river.
[377.50 → 379.62] He eventually gets adopted by pharaoh's daughter,
[379.96 → 381.14] gets to live in the palace,
[381.54 → 382.26] learn their customs.
[382.34 → 384.48] But one day, he sees a Hebrew man
[384.48 → 386.44] being treated poorly by an Egyptian soldier.
[386.44 → 388.36] So he kills the Egyptian soldier,
[388.84 → 390.42] gets called out for it, and flees.
[391.10 → 392.10] And now he's on the run.
[392.52 → 394.86] He's a shepherd for his father-in-law,
[395.04 → 397.24] and he's been in the wilderness for a long time.
[397.44 → 400.08] And then he sees a burning bush.
[400.56 → 403.28] And that is the text that we are in today.
[404.50 → 407.08] So interestingly, the years of Moses' life,
[407.18 → 409.58] they're divided into three 40-year chunks.
[409.70 → 411.62] It worked out quite perfectly for him, actually.
[411.62 → 413.20] So the first 40 years,
[413.30 → 415.26] he spends in the palace in Egypt.
[415.52 → 417.34] Then he kills that man, and he flees.
[417.40 → 418.42] In the next 40 years,
[418.42 → 421.54] he is a shepherd in the wilderness in Median.
[421.84 → 423.58] And the third starts with this passage.
[423.68 → 424.60] He sees this bush,
[424.84 → 425.84] and he eventually goes
[425.84 → 428.76] and helps lead the Israelites out of Egypt.
[429.18 → 430.22] That's how it's broken down.
[430.30 → 431.72] Now, it's interesting, though,
[431.76 → 437.46] because Moses was born to be Israel's deliverer.
[437.80 → 440.18] He was born to help lead them out of the Promised Land.
[440.18 → 444.12] And yet, not a word of that is mentioned to him
[444.12 → 446.50] until he's 80 years old.
[446.50 → 448.92] As we continue through this story,
[449.00 → 449.78] remember that nugget,
[449.86 → 450.86] because that's very important.
[451.90 → 453.22] The other interesting note
[453.22 → 454.84] before we really dig into this text
[454.84 → 458.38] is the location that this story takes place.
[459.26 → 460.88] Verse 12 of our text tells us this.
[461.54 → 463.66] But the mountain where Moses was,
[463.74 → 465.32] where this burning bush story takes place,
[465.38 → 466.24] is the same mountain
[466.24 → 467.92] that Moses will later receive
[467.92 → 470.00] the Ten Commandments from God,
[470.18 → 471.08] and the same mountain
[471.08 → 472.74] that the Israelites will worship God.
[473.56 → 475.38] Some details like that slip through sometimes
[475.38 → 476.14] when we hear these stories,
[476.20 → 477.04] but I found that fascinating
[477.04 → 478.50] that God uses this place
[478.50 → 480.44] as sort of central hub
[480.44 → 482.06] for a lot of the different things that he does.
[483.08 → 484.26] Now to the text at hand.
[484.32 → 486.56] There are two characteristics of God
[486.56 → 488.50] that come out of this encounter
[488.50 → 491.66] that deserve our attention today.
[492.42 → 493.12] And so we're going to look
[493.12 → 494.68] at these two characteristics now.
[495.12 → 499.30] The first characteristic of God
[499.30 → 500.66] that comes from this passage
[500.66 → 503.36] is the power of God.
[504.68 → 506.12] It's God's power.
[507.08 → 508.18] God appears to Moses
[508.18 → 509.50] in the form of a burning bush.
[509.86 → 510.70] Now throughout the Bible,
[511.10 → 512.38] God uses fire and smoke
[512.38 → 513.90] to symbolize his presence.
[514.36 → 515.48] Even nowadays, of course,
[515.58 → 517.08] we will light candles
[517.08 → 518.70] to symbolize Christ's presence
[518.70 → 520.16] or the Holy Spirit's presence
[520.16 → 520.86] in our service.
[521.46 → 522.70] But here in this story,
[522.78 → 524.88] this is much, much more
[524.88 → 526.12] than a symbol.
[526.12 → 529.80] This was God present
[529.80 → 531.54] in the burning bush.
[532.70 → 533.86] Now if you read your text,
[533.94 → 535.48] it might seem a bit confusing at first
[535.48 → 536.58] because verse 2 says
[536.58 → 537.62] that an angel of the Lord
[537.62 → 538.84] appeared to Moses in the bush.
[539.10 → 540.20] But then right after that,
[540.28 → 540.80] in verse 4,
[540.86 → 542.32] it says that God called out
[542.32 → 543.14] from the bush.
[543.88 → 545.42] Now it's important to note this too,
[545.50 → 546.96] just to clarify that a little bit.
[547.18 → 548.46] In the early Old Testament,
[548.86 → 549.52] in the early,
[549.62 → 550.54] the Pentateuch especially,
[550.98 → 552.52] angels were not simply
[552.52 → 554.14] just messengers.
[554.14 → 556.38] They weren't just messengers
[556.38 → 558.06] delivering a message from God.
[558.52 → 559.28] But in fact,
[559.36 → 560.16] they were entities
[560.16 → 562.00] that embodied the living God.
[562.86 → 565.06] God came down to his people
[565.06 → 567.02] in the presence of an angel
[567.02 → 568.30] elsewhere in the Old Testament too,
[568.34 → 569.22] like when God called down
[569.22 → 570.74] to Hagar in Genesis 21,
[570.96 → 572.34] or when God wrestled Jacob
[572.34 → 573.40] in Genesis 32,
[573.70 → 575.32] or when God spoke to Gideon
[575.32 → 576.50] in Judges 6.
[576.64 → 578.08] So this is the same thing here.
[578.28 → 580.80] This is God present in the bush.
[581.06 → 581.74] Nothing else.
[582.02 → 583.10] Nothing less than that.
[585.14 → 586.50] So we've got God in the bush.
[586.58 → 587.56] He calls Moses over,
[587.64 → 588.64] and then they've got this dialogue.
[588.82 → 589.98] And read this with me right now.
[590.26 → 591.56] Look at verses 4 to 6.
[591.98 → 592.58] God calls out.
[592.62 → 592.82] He says,
[592.92 → 593.90] Moses, Moses.
[594.40 → 595.34] Then Moses replies,
[595.42 → 595.94] Here I am.
[596.82 → 597.34] And God says,
[597.40 → 598.24] Don't come any closer.
[600.08 → 601.30] Take off your sandals,
[601.52 → 602.86] for the place where you're standing
[602.86 → 603.84] is holy ground.
[605.22 → 605.94] That's interesting.
[606.72 → 607.60] God then goes on,
[607.64 → 608.00] and he says,
[608.08 → 609.48] I am the God of your father,
[609.48 → 610.78] the God of Abraham,
[611.02 → 611.70] the God of Isaac,
[611.80 → 612.50] the God of Jacob.
[612.50 → 614.82] And after God says this to Moses,
[615.88 → 618.62] Moses hides his face from him.
[619.96 → 620.48] Why?
[622.52 → 623.60] The text tells us
[623.60 → 624.94] it's not in reverence to God.
[625.54 → 627.46] It's not because of shame.
[627.60 → 629.74] It's not because of guilt of past sins
[629.74 → 631.04] that he's committed.
[632.04 → 634.40] It's because he feared God.
[634.48 → 636.84] He feared to look at God.
[637.74 → 638.54] This was not guilt.
[638.68 → 639.60] This was not shame.
[640.24 → 641.28] This was fear
[641.28 → 643.70] that caused Moses to hide his face.
[644.48 → 645.32] This is huge.
[645.40 → 646.40] This is a big detail.
[646.80 → 648.18] There's a parallel story in the Bible,
[648.32 → 649.26] Isaiah chapter 6,
[649.42 → 651.74] where God calls out to Isaiah in a vision.
[652.02 → 653.50] And it's a very similar situation,
[653.60 → 654.36] just like this story.
[654.70 → 656.06] Isaiah turns his face
[656.06 → 657.74] from God in that story.
[658.44 → 659.52] But in Isaiah's case,
[659.66 → 661.26] it's because he feels unworthy.
[661.88 → 662.92] It's because he feels
[662.92 → 664.30] that he is too sinful.
[664.30 → 666.26] He is unable to look at God
[666.26 → 667.36] because of the sins
[667.36 → 668.16] that he has committed.
[668.78 → 670.92] And then God touches Isaiah's lips
[670.92 → 671.54] and says,
[671.98 → 673.28] your guilt is taken away.
[673.68 → 675.76] Your sin is atoned for.
[677.52 → 678.86] In fact, sin and guilt
[678.86 → 680.98] are often the first thing acknowledged
[680.98 → 682.80] when the living God
[682.80 → 684.12] interacts with his people.
[684.80 → 685.62] If you think about Jesus
[685.62 → 686.54] when he walked this earth,
[686.82 → 689.18] how often before he heals someone
[689.18 → 690.62] or while he's healing someone,
[690.76 → 693.08] is he also forgiving their sins?
[694.30 → 695.06] Constantly.
[697.52 → 699.20] But that's not here in this story.
[700.38 → 701.04] Notice that?
[701.88 → 702.24] Now remember,
[702.34 → 703.60] Moses is very guilty of sin,
[703.76 → 705.04] the least of which is murder.
[706.10 → 707.38] And that's why he finds himself
[707.38 → 708.44] in this neck of the woods anyway.
[708.58 → 709.74] But this is not guilt or shame
[709.74 → 710.60] that he's hiding its face.
[710.66 → 714.20] It's because he is afraid of God.
[715.14 → 716.68] Moral demand and forgiveness
[716.68 → 719.02] play little to no role
[719.02 → 721.80] in this encounter with God.
[722.94 → 723.78] So here,
[724.48 → 728.44] God's not portrayed as love or justice,
[729.36 → 731.40] but he's portrayed as power.
[732.76 → 733.90] Now of course God is love
[733.90 → 735.14] and of course God is just.
[735.24 → 736.24] That's not to minimize that.
[736.24 → 737.10] But right here,
[737.18 → 738.82] those characteristics aren't spoken of,
[739.14 → 741.12] but his power is.
[743.10 → 743.54] Moses,
[744.00 → 746.76] standing in the powerful presence of God,
[746.76 → 748.14] has to take his sandals off
[748.14 → 749.64] and hide his face.
[751.84 → 753.18] Now the power of God
[753.18 → 754.72] is definitely a constant theme
[754.72 → 755.20] in the Bible,
[755.20 → 756.38] but I think it's actually one
[756.38 → 758.34] that we often brush aside.
[759.96 → 761.98] Perhaps it's because it's
[761.98 → 762.90] incomprehensible.
[763.56 → 764.46] Perhaps because
[764.46 → 766.70] it's less attractive to us
[766.70 → 767.54] than love
[767.54 → 767.94] or
[767.94 → 769.52] or his mercy.
[769.92 → 770.94] Those we like,
[771.10 → 771.84] they're attractive.
[771.98 → 773.06] We can relate to those.
[773.06 → 773.82] But his power?
[774.90 → 775.84] Not so much.
[777.96 → 779.34] We can't truly grasp
[779.34 → 779.88] the magnitude
[779.88 → 781.48] of God's characteristics,
[781.74 → 781.84] though,
[781.88 → 782.96] unless we understand
[782.96 → 783.68] God's power.
[784.74 → 785.42] God's grace,
[785.54 → 786.04] God's mercy,
[786.14 → 786.80] God's justice,
[786.96 → 788.40] they are all predicated
[788.40 → 789.76] on this very power
[789.76 → 790.92] that God possesses.
[791.82 → 792.62] His grace,
[792.76 → 793.24] his mercy,
[793.32 → 793.88] his justice,
[794.18 → 794.88] none of them
[794.88 → 796.22] hold up to anything
[796.22 → 797.56] if it weren't
[797.56 → 799.18] for God's power.
[800.32 → 801.80] And Moses got that.
[803.06 → 803.94] So he was afraid.
[805.96 → 807.12] The distance between
[807.12 → 808.12] God and man here
[808.12 → 808.78] is highlighted
[808.78 → 809.52] in this encounter
[809.52 → 810.26] and that distance
[810.26 → 811.36] is measured
[811.36 → 812.34] by power.
[812.66 → 813.74] Now all of us today,
[814.82 → 816.20] this is applicable to us
[816.20 → 817.20] because in our approaches
[817.20 → 817.66] to God,
[817.76 → 818.40] in our approaches
[818.40 → 819.30] to other man,
[819.82 → 821.00] it's going to behoove us
[821.00 → 821.66] all to remember
[821.66 → 823.26] that infinite distance
[823.26 → 824.48] that exists
[824.48 → 825.84] in the power
[825.84 → 827.78] between us and God.
[829.12 → 830.08] I think we can so easily
[830.08 → 830.90] call God friend,
[831.02 → 831.72] we can so easily
[831.72 → 832.72] call God our father,
[832.72 → 833.38] our saviour,
[833.76 → 835.12] we so easily blame him
[835.12 → 836.30] when things are going wrong,
[836.44 → 837.40] we get mad at him
[837.40 → 838.54] when we don't get our way,
[838.72 → 839.54] we get frustrated
[839.54 → 840.22] when we don't understand
[840.22 → 840.82] what's happening,
[841.00 → 842.10] but how often
[842.10 → 843.20] do we sit
[843.20 → 844.50] and tremble
[844.50 → 846.46] at the reality
[846.46 → 847.36] that God
[847.36 → 850.10] is so much
[850.10 → 852.28] more infinitely powerful
[852.28 → 854.06] than any of us?
[854.06 → 856.92] and in a culture
[856.92 → 858.44] that teaches us
[858.44 → 859.14] that we are
[859.14 → 860.38] our own gods,
[861.06 → 863.42] this is incredibly important
[863.42 → 864.34] for us to remember.
[866.38 → 867.82] So that's the first characteristic.
[868.00 → 868.74] God is powerful.
[869.22 → 869.94] What's beautiful
[869.94 → 870.96] in this passage though
[870.96 → 872.28] is that in
[872.28 → 873.52] his infinite
[873.52 → 874.68] and ultimate power,
[874.94 → 876.62] we see a second characteristic
[876.62 → 878.20] come to the top
[878.20 → 879.32] and shine through.
[879.32 → 881.52] And this is a characteristic
[881.52 → 882.74] that often doesn't
[882.74 → 884.18] accompany power.
[885.78 → 886.68] And that is that
[886.68 → 887.84] God is concerned
[887.84 → 889.76] for his people.
[891.42 → 892.90] That's the sole reason
[892.90 → 893.66] for this encounter
[893.66 → 894.38] in the first place.
[894.84 → 896.46] God was concerned
[896.46 → 897.78] for his people.
[899.30 → 900.86] Just before this passage,
[901.06 → 902.18] the last three verses
[902.18 → 903.20] in Exodus 2,
[903.40 → 904.76] there are four terms used
[904.76 → 908.26] to describe God's response
[908.26 → 909.16] to his people's suffering.
[909.68 → 910.44] So if you've got your Bibles,
[910.54 → 911.16] you can look at that too.
[911.22 → 912.58] Exodus 2, 23 to 25.
[912.90 → 913.52] God heard
[913.52 → 914.94] his people's groaning.
[915.34 → 916.18] He remembered
[916.18 → 917.62] his promises to them.
[917.70 → 918.34] He saw
[918.34 → 919.34] their suffering
[919.34 → 920.46] and he knew
[920.46 → 921.46] they needed saving.
[922.46 → 923.16] God heard,
[923.38 → 923.86] remembered,
[924.24 → 924.52] saw,
[924.68 → 925.14] and knew.
[925.70 → 926.62] And then in this text
[926.62 → 927.56] that we read to today,
[928.08 → 928.60] God
[928.60 → 931.66] uses the same language.
[932.82 → 933.38] You can read that
[933.38 → 934.36] in verse 7
[934.36 → 935.24] through 10.
[935.34 → 936.22] God saw the misery
[936.22 → 936.76] of his people.
[936.98 → 938.24] He heard them crying out.
[939.12 → 940.20] The people's cries
[940.20 → 940.74] reached him
[940.74 → 941.28] and he saw
[941.28 → 942.18] how they were being oppressed.
[942.52 → 943.86] So because God saw this,
[944.06 → 945.26] he remembered his people
[945.26 → 946.52] and he tells Moses
[946.52 → 947.32] that he has come down
[947.32 → 948.00] to save him.
[949.48 → 950.16] All of this
[950.16 → 951.00] because he is concerned
[951.00 → 951.64] for his people.
[953.48 → 954.46] And the result
[954.46 → 955.40] of his concern
[955.40 → 956.66] are the words
[956.66 → 957.80] of Exodus 3,
[957.98 → 959.20] verse 8
[959.20 → 960.58] in our text today.
[961.18 → 964.08] I have come down.
[965.36 → 966.36] God had come down
[966.36 → 966.96] to his people
[966.96 → 968.10] and he was about
[968.10 → 969.84] to divinely intervene
[969.84 → 971.64] to get them out of Egypt
[971.64 → 972.80] and into the promised land.
[974.08 → 974.86] And then do you know
[974.86 → 975.84] how the story goes from there?
[976.64 → 977.84] God does come down.
[978.52 → 979.42] He saves his people
[979.42 → 979.88] from Egypt.
[980.00 → 980.74] He leads them
[980.74 → 981.94] to the promised land
[981.94 → 983.16] and establishes them there.
[983.92 → 984.92] And then generations
[984.92 → 985.74] go by
[985.74 → 987.34] and the generations
[987.34 → 988.46] come, and they go
[988.46 → 989.30] and God's people,
[989.50 → 990.56] while they're stubborn,
[990.56 → 992.46] they would disobey God
[992.46 → 993.66] and God's calling
[993.66 → 994.42] on their lives.
[994.50 → 995.12] They would sin
[995.12 → 996.22] and they would worship idols
[996.22 → 997.04] and they would bow down
[997.04 → 997.74] to false gods
[997.74 → 999.04] and they would take over
[999.04 → 999.56] the customs
[999.56 → 1000.84] of the people around them.
[1000.96 → 1001.84] So much so that
[1001.84 → 1002.66] it gets really bad.
[1002.72 → 1003.62] They start sacrificing
[1003.62 → 1004.46] their own children
[1004.46 → 1006.00] to these false gods.
[1006.20 → 1007.46] And it gets really,
[1007.66 → 1008.94] terrible.
[1010.68 → 1011.84] And God's watching
[1011.84 → 1012.94] the whole time.
[1013.94 → 1014.70] And he would always
[1014.70 → 1015.28] be listening.
[1016.34 → 1017.56] He'd always be speaking
[1017.56 → 1018.10] to them,
[1018.52 → 1019.68] telling them to turn to him.
[1021.24 → 1022.08] But they don't.
[1023.68 → 1024.50] And they suffer
[1024.50 → 1026.48] again and again.
[1026.84 → 1027.76] They become captives.
[1027.98 → 1028.80] They become captives
[1028.80 → 1029.42] to Assyria.
[1029.50 → 1030.30] They become captives
[1030.30 → 1030.84] to Babylon.
[1031.10 → 1031.82] They become captives
[1031.82 → 1032.44] to Persia.
[1034.06 → 1034.98] Until one day,
[1036.84 → 1037.80] God's concern
[1037.80 → 1039.94] culminates
[1039.94 → 1041.94] in Bethlehem
[1041.94 → 1043.44] where once again
[1043.44 → 1044.28] he comes down
[1044.28 → 1045.98] as a baby this time,
[1046.06 → 1046.94] not in a burning bush,
[1046.94 → 1048.48] but with the same intentions,
[1048.60 → 1050.36] to save his people.
[1052.72 → 1054.62] This baby is born,
[1054.70 → 1055.42] the Son of God,
[1055.46 → 1056.48] who grows into this man,
[1056.54 → 1057.44] who dies on a cross
[1057.44 → 1058.64] and is risen from the dead
[1058.64 → 1059.88] and he ultimately
[1059.88 → 1061.22] defeats sin and death
[1061.22 → 1062.36] for good.
[1064.66 → 1066.16] See, God's concern
[1066.16 → 1066.92] for his people
[1066.92 → 1068.20] has been a permanent fixture.
[1070.70 → 1071.96] He was concerned for them
[1071.96 → 1072.86] when they were captives
[1072.86 → 1073.42] in Egypt.
[1073.58 → 1074.52] He was concerned for them
[1074.52 → 1075.32] when they were captives
[1075.32 → 1076.24] to their own sin
[1076.24 → 1077.06] in the promised land.
[1077.06 → 1078.40] He was concerned for them
[1078.40 → 1081.76] when they were in captivity
[1081.76 → 1082.56] in their own sins,
[1082.60 → 1083.12] like I said.
[1083.40 → 1085.24] He was concerned for them
[1085.24 → 1086.04] when they were awaiting
[1086.04 → 1086.66] this Messiah.
[1086.76 → 1087.68] He was concerned for them
[1087.68 → 1088.52] when the Messiah came
[1088.52 → 1089.86] and they did not recognize him.
[1090.54 → 1091.30] And brothers and sisters,
[1091.42 → 1093.26] his concern for his people
[1093.26 → 1094.72] continues today.
[1094.72 → 1098.60] So whether you are here
[1098.60 → 1099.16] this morning,
[1099.30 → 1100.08] here in the sanctuary,
[1100.30 → 1101.06] there in the foyer,
[1101.26 → 1102.24] at home as well,
[1103.24 → 1104.92] and you are being held captive
[1104.92 → 1105.62] by depression
[1105.62 → 1107.94] or you're being held captive
[1107.94 → 1108.62] by grief
[1108.62 → 1110.28] or by worry
[1110.28 → 1112.28] or by fear
[1112.28 → 1113.48] or by confusion
[1113.48 → 1115.22] or by anxiety
[1115.22 → 1116.12] or by frustration
[1116.12 → 1116.94] or by pain
[1116.94 → 1118.54] or by whatever affliction
[1118.54 → 1119.40] you find yourself
[1119.40 → 1120.30] going through today,
[1120.30 → 1123.78] God is concerned
[1123.78 → 1124.58] for his people.
[1128.32 → 1129.48] So much so
[1129.48 → 1130.64] that he came down
[1130.64 → 1131.34] a third time
[1131.34 → 1132.40] permanently
[1132.40 → 1133.34] with his Holy Spirit
[1133.34 → 1134.04] to be with
[1134.04 → 1135.10] and to walk with
[1135.10 → 1135.96] his people.
[1137.52 → 1138.96] The Father came down
[1138.96 → 1139.86] in a burning bush
[1139.86 → 1140.60] to save his people
[1140.60 → 1141.58] from slavery in Egypt.
[1141.76 → 1142.96] The Son came down
[1142.96 → 1143.78] in Bethlehem
[1143.78 → 1144.52] to save his people
[1144.52 → 1145.04] from death.
[1145.36 → 1146.14] And the Holy Spirit
[1146.14 → 1146.72] came down
[1146.72 → 1148.14] to save his people
[1148.14 → 1150.04] from whatever captivity
[1150.04 → 1151.28] that life's trials
[1151.28 → 1152.04] and temptations
[1152.04 → 1152.70] bring on you.
[1152.98 → 1153.80] God is here
[1153.80 → 1154.72] not to remove
[1154.72 → 1155.30] those trials
[1155.30 → 1155.98] and temptations
[1155.98 → 1157.42] but to bear it with us,
[1157.50 → 1158.62] to walk with us,
[1158.72 → 1159.90] to help us through it,
[1160.04 → 1161.98] and to be with us
[1161.98 → 1163.44] in whatever captivity
[1163.44 → 1164.50] we find ourselves.
[1164.82 → 1165.48] And even though
[1165.48 → 1166.52] it may not seem like that
[1166.52 → 1167.18] all the time,
[1167.36 → 1168.88] he is holding us all
[1168.88 → 1169.84] in hands
[1169.84 → 1170.86] more powerful
[1170.86 → 1171.88] than we ever care
[1171.88 → 1172.50] to admit
[1172.50 → 1173.86] or ever
[1173.86 → 1176.14] can comprehend.
[1178.14 → 1178.78] And those two
[1178.78 → 1179.84] characteristics of God,
[1179.90 → 1180.48] his power
[1180.48 → 1181.84] and his concern,
[1182.84 → 1183.46] they go together
[1183.46 → 1184.22] so beautifully
[1184.22 → 1187.14] that my prayer
[1187.14 → 1187.74] for us today
[1187.74 → 1188.24] is that we can
[1188.24 → 1189.24] just simply begin
[1189.24 → 1190.66] to wrap our heads
[1190.66 → 1192.42] around the beautiful
[1192.42 → 1193.42] truth that is
[1193.42 → 1194.32] both of those things.
[1197.30 → 1198.06] The last thing
[1198.06 → 1198.66] I'd like to look at
[1198.66 → 1199.50] today from this passage
[1199.50 → 1199.86] is this.
[1199.92 → 1201.42] It's Moses' response.
[1201.84 → 1202.68] Now in order to do that
[1202.68 → 1203.34] though, we have to remember
[1203.34 → 1204.06] his context
[1204.06 → 1205.06] just a little bit.
[1205.94 → 1206.32] Now remember,
[1206.44 → 1207.20] Moses was working
[1207.20 → 1208.04] as a shepherd
[1208.04 → 1209.96] for about 40 years
[1209.96 → 1211.50] before this time happened.
[1211.98 → 1212.56] Now for someone
[1212.56 → 1213.48] of his knowledge,
[1213.84 → 1215.08] for someone of his education
[1215.08 → 1215.64] in the past,
[1215.92 → 1216.50] this would have been
[1216.50 → 1217.02] considered
[1217.02 → 1218.58] very poor employment
[1218.58 → 1219.20] actually.
[1220.16 → 1221.42] Very poor employment.
[1221.90 → 1222.32] And yet,
[1223.00 → 1223.26] Moses
[1223.26 → 1224.78] was very content
[1224.78 → 1225.72] doing this.
[1226.66 → 1227.30] He was happy
[1227.30 → 1227.92] to be a shepherd
[1227.92 → 1228.40] in Median.
[1228.74 → 1229.52] He was satisfied.
[1229.70 → 1230.20] He was meek
[1230.20 → 1230.72] and content
[1230.72 → 1231.70] and he was humble
[1231.70 → 1232.46] as he worked
[1232.46 → 1232.94] as a shepherd.
[1233.14 → 1233.98] And these are all things
[1233.98 → 1235.10] that he is quite celebrated
[1235.10 → 1236.38] for in the Bible.
[1237.28 → 1237.88] Numbers 12,
[1237.94 → 1238.38] verse 3
[1238.38 → 1239.14] says this.
[1239.34 → 1239.52] It says,
[1239.72 → 1241.72] Moses was a very humble man,
[1241.86 → 1242.82] more humble
[1242.82 → 1244.02] than anyone
[1244.02 → 1245.28] else
[1245.28 → 1246.16] on the face
[1246.16 → 1247.20] of the earth.
[1248.12 → 1248.80] Isn't that something?
[1248.86 → 1249.50] That's quite a thing
[1249.50 → 1250.68] to be remembered for.
[1252.00 → 1252.54] Now keep in mind,
[1252.60 → 1253.58] Moses wrote numbers,
[1253.72 → 1254.18] so like,
[1254.24 → 1255.36] it's a little bit awkward
[1255.36 → 1256.36] to write that about yourself,
[1256.52 → 1257.74] but it's a little grain of salt.
[1257.82 → 1258.52] No, I'm kidding, of course.
[1258.74 → 1259.96] We can take that as truth,
[1260.04 → 1261.28] that Moses was
[1261.28 → 1262.02] humble.
[1262.54 → 1263.36] He was content,
[1263.36 → 1264.50] he was meek,
[1265.30 → 1266.54] and he was far from the man
[1266.54 → 1267.88] he was earlier in his life,
[1268.78 → 1269.54] when he was powerful
[1269.54 → 1270.38] and educated
[1270.38 → 1271.58] and he had means
[1271.58 → 1272.74] and a position of authority
[1272.74 → 1274.02] and had ultimate access
[1274.02 → 1274.56] to Pharaoh.
[1276.00 → 1276.76] In fact,
[1277.06 → 1279.04] if this were anybody else's plan
[1279.04 → 1279.72] other than God's,
[1279.72 → 1280.44] you would have thought
[1280.44 → 1282.02] that Moses would have been
[1282.02 → 1282.80] approached earlier
[1282.80 → 1284.36] when he had access to Pharaoh,
[1284.42 → 1285.18] when he had means
[1285.18 → 1286.08] and he had authority
[1286.08 → 1287.28] and he had all this power.
[1288.32 → 1289.48] To the human mind,
[1289.54 → 1290.86] that makes the most sense.
[1291.86 → 1293.04] That's how we function.
[1294.24 → 1295.18] But this wasn't
[1295.18 → 1296.18] someone else's plan,
[1296.24 → 1297.08] this was God's plan.
[1297.20 → 1297.86] God was patient.
[1298.38 → 1298.84] He waited.
[1299.92 → 1301.62] God waited until Moses had fled
[1301.62 → 1303.00] and he was a fugitive
[1303.00 → 1304.50] and he tended sheep
[1304.50 → 1305.86] for 40 years in Median
[1305.86 → 1306.94] in the middle of nowhere
[1306.94 → 1308.24] because God needed Moses
[1308.24 → 1309.68] to stop being the brash,
[1310.24 → 1310.88] know-it-all,
[1311.34 → 1312.98] fix things on his own man
[1312.98 → 1313.72] he once was
[1313.72 → 1314.94] because apparently
[1314.94 → 1315.78] all that ever led Moses
[1315.78 → 1316.98] to do was murder someone.
[1318.74 → 1319.92] No, God needed to be patient
[1319.92 → 1320.78] and he needed to wait
[1320.78 → 1321.58] for Moses to become
[1321.58 → 1322.16] meek and humble
[1322.16 → 1323.00] because then
[1323.00 → 1324.70] it was God's power
[1324.70 → 1326.02] that saved his people.
[1327.02 → 1328.32] It wasn't Moses' position,
[1328.56 → 1329.90] it wasn't Moses' education,
[1330.36 → 1331.76] it wasn't Moses' means.
[1334.02 → 1334.88] It's interesting though,
[1334.92 → 1336.44] Moses almost became too meek,
[1336.58 → 1337.50] he almost became too humble
[1337.50 → 1339.16] because when God asks Moses
[1339.16 → 1339.80] at the burning bush
[1339.80 → 1340.62] to go bring his people
[1340.62 → 1341.20] out of Egypt,
[1341.60 → 1343.00] Moses replies in verse 11
[1343.00 → 1344.66] with who am I?
[1344.74 → 1345.76] Who am I to do this?
[1345.76 → 1348.62] In fact,
[1348.70 → 1349.40] later in this chapter
[1349.40 → 1350.16] we didn't get to that,
[1350.24 → 1351.16] Moses thinks of a bunch
[1351.16 → 1352.00] of reasons why he should
[1352.00 → 1352.68] not be doing this.
[1352.88 → 1353.40] What if the people
[1353.40 → 1354.06] don't believe me,
[1354.10 → 1354.36] he says.
[1354.40 → 1355.34] I'm not really eloquent,
[1355.46 → 1356.58] I can't speak in front of people,
[1356.62 → 1357.54] this isn't a job for me
[1357.54 → 1358.90] and after all his excuses,
[1359.44 → 1360.38] he simply looks at God
[1360.38 → 1360.64] and he says,
[1360.74 → 1360.98] God,
[1361.22 → 1364.08] please just send someone else.
[1368.52 → 1369.42] His response maybe
[1369.42 → 1370.48] shouldn't be that surprising
[1370.48 → 1371.32] to us though, right?
[1373.60 → 1374.82] We ask the same questions,
[1374.90 → 1375.20] don't we?
[1376.76 → 1377.20] God,
[1377.24 → 1378.34] I can't pray for that person,
[1378.42 → 1379.04] not here,
[1379.16 → 1379.62] not now,
[1379.70 → 1380.38] not publicly.
[1381.76 → 1382.20] God,
[1382.24 → 1384.14] I'm not spiritually mature enough
[1384.14 → 1385.12] to lead that ministry.
[1387.32 → 1387.76] God,
[1387.80 → 1388.40] I'm not eloquent.
[1388.62 → 1390.56] I can't speak your gospel
[1390.56 → 1391.70] to people I don't know.
[1393.26 → 1393.70] God,
[1393.74 → 1395.12] I don't want to be an elder,
[1395.34 → 1395.96] just God,
[1396.34 → 1398.40] please send someone else.
[1401.74 → 1403.30] The ironic problem is
[1403.30 → 1405.42] when we feel this way,
[1405.76 → 1408.22] it is exactly the kind of person
[1408.22 → 1409.58] that God wants to use
[1409.58 → 1411.20] to fulfill his kingdom purposes.
[1413.38 → 1414.68] When we accept the fact
[1414.68 → 1415.98] that maybe we don't have
[1415.98 → 1416.62] what it takes
[1416.62 → 1418.10] to do all the things
[1418.10 → 1419.48] God be me calling us to do,
[1420.28 → 1421.34] then it's God
[1421.34 → 1422.62] who gets the glory
[1422.62 → 1424.62] for accomplishing his purposes
[1424.62 → 1425.44] through us.
[1425.44 → 1426.44] God's sake.
[1426.44 → 1428.18] So even though Moses
[1428.18 → 1429.42] responded with excuses
[1429.42 → 1430.38] and fear
[1430.38 → 1431.68] and a lot of hesitation,
[1432.42 → 1433.26] God picked him up,
[1433.96 → 1434.98] he sent him out,
[1435.24 → 1436.52] and he used him
[1436.52 → 1437.66] in all his limitations,
[1437.66 → 1438.62] and Moses became
[1438.62 → 1441.16] one of the greatest fathers
[1441.16 → 1441.94] of our faith
[1441.94 → 1443.22] the world has ever known.
[1443.22 → 1447.50] Now the internet,
[1448.18 → 1449.66] it's a very interesting place.
[1451.20 → 1452.42] It's got tons of stuff,
[1452.54 → 1453.34] wormholes that you can
[1453.34 → 1454.00] get sucked into,
[1454.18 → 1455.14] videos that are completely
[1455.14 → 1456.72] used to watch,
[1457.06 → 1457.78] just a big waste
[1457.78 → 1458.40] of time generally,
[1458.48 → 1459.90] but every once in a while
[1459.90 → 1461.08] it gives you this
[1461.08 → 1462.42] beautiful gem
[1462.42 → 1463.58] that you can use
[1463.58 → 1464.58] in a certain situation.
[1465.72 → 1466.32] And as I was
[1466.32 → 1467.86] writing this message,
[1468.08 → 1469.42] I saw this meme,
[1469.54 → 1470.02] this picture,
[1470.02 → 1471.12] and it sums up
[1471.12 → 1472.14] this point so beautifully.
[1472.96 → 1473.68] See, Moses thought
[1473.68 → 1474.54] he wasn't qualified
[1474.54 → 1475.72] to be able to fulfill
[1475.72 → 1477.50] God's calling for him,
[1477.70 → 1478.94] but the truth is
[1478.94 → 1481.36] God doesn't call
[1481.36 → 1482.04] the qualified.
[1482.88 → 1484.62] God qualifies the called.
[1486.32 → 1487.40] God doesn't call
[1487.40 → 1488.26] the qualified.
[1488.90 → 1490.24] He qualifies the called.
[1490.30 → 1491.04] Who saw that meme?
[1491.10 → 1492.16] Anybody see a meme like that?
[1492.92 → 1493.84] I could have possibly
[1493.84 → 1494.74] taken credit for this.
[1494.78 → 1495.34] That's too bad.
[1496.00 → 1496.60] This is why you shouldn't
[1496.60 → 1497.64] preface things like this.
[1497.90 → 1498.72] That would have been brilliant,
[1498.86 → 1498.96] hey?
[1500.02 → 1501.10] God doesn't call
[1501.10 → 1501.80] the qualified.
[1502.10 → 1503.68] He qualifies the called.
[1503.94 → 1504.86] See, we're all called.
[1505.70 → 1506.30] All of us.
[1506.34 → 1506.90] We're all called.
[1506.98 → 1507.74] We're called to love.
[1508.02 → 1508.90] We're called to serve.
[1509.14 → 1509.94] We're called to forgive.
[1510.16 → 1511.00] We're called to submit
[1511.00 → 1512.04] to God.
[1513.58 → 1514.38] Perhaps you don't always
[1514.38 → 1515.68] feel qualified to lead
[1515.68 → 1517.04] or to pray in front of people
[1517.04 → 1518.34] or to love people
[1518.34 → 1519.46] who are difficult to love
[1519.46 → 1520.18] or to serve
[1520.18 → 1521.36] in different capacities,
[1521.72 → 1522.66] but in some way
[1522.66 → 1523.46] or another, church,
[1524.54 → 1525.46] you're the body of Christ.
[1525.54 → 1526.48] We're all the body of Christ.
[1526.58 → 1527.24] We are all called
[1527.24 → 1527.96] to these things.
[1527.96 → 1530.42] Take our church's
[1530.42 → 1531.02] mission statement,
[1531.12 → 1531.52] for example.
[1531.62 → 1532.66] Perhaps gathering
[1532.66 → 1533.42] or growing
[1533.42 → 1534.74] or going right now
[1534.74 → 1535.92] just seems difficult.
[1536.14 → 1537.32] It seems too hard for us.
[1537.38 → 1538.78] It seems that we're not
[1538.78 → 1539.76] qualified to do that.
[1540.68 → 1541.58] It's too difficult
[1541.58 → 1542.46] for us to accomplish.
[1544.42 → 1546.18] But God doesn't call us
[1546.18 → 1546.66] to these things
[1546.66 → 1547.54] because we're qualified.
[1549.24 → 1550.26] It's quite the opposite,
[1550.42 → 1550.58] actually.
[1550.64 → 1551.56] God calls us
[1551.56 → 1552.38] to do these things
[1552.38 → 1553.72] in spite of our qualifications.
[1553.72 → 1553.96] Christians.
[1556.02 → 1556.72] It's only then
[1556.72 → 1557.54] that God gets to be
[1557.54 → 1558.62] ultimately glorified.
[1561.02 → 1561.86] The Apostle Paul
[1561.86 → 1563.06] says this so beautifully
[1563.06 → 1563.70] in one of his letters
[1563.70 → 1565.48] to the church in Corinth.
[1565.64 → 1566.44] He says these thousands
[1566.44 → 1567.44] and thousands of years later.
[1567.54 → 1568.02] He says this.
[1568.06 → 1568.28] He says,
[1568.36 → 1569.08] Brothers and sisters,
[1569.88 → 1571.04] this is not actually very kind,
[1571.10 → 1571.92] but it's a perfect point.
[1572.00 → 1572.12] He's like,
[1572.18 → 1572.78] Brothers and sisters,
[1572.96 → 1573.98] not many of you
[1573.98 → 1574.78] were wise
[1574.78 → 1576.02] by human standards.
[1577.10 → 1578.48] Not many were influential.
[1579.68 → 1581.34] Not many are of noble birth.
[1581.34 → 1584.30] But God chose
[1584.30 → 1585.76] the foolish things
[1585.76 → 1586.72] of this world
[1586.72 → 1588.68] to shame the wise.
[1589.74 → 1591.20] God chose the weak things
[1591.20 → 1591.86] of the world
[1591.86 → 1594.04] to shame the strong
[1594.04 → 1596.10] so that no one
[1596.10 → 1597.66] may boast before him.
[1598.14 → 1599.20] It is because of him
[1599.20 → 1601.18] that you are in Christ Jesus.
[1602.36 → 1603.48] Therefore, as it is written,
[1604.38 → 1605.64] let the one who boasts
[1605.64 → 1607.60] boast in the Lord.
[1607.60 → 1612.10] God doesn't call the qualified.
[1612.54 → 1614.04] He qualifies the called.
[1615.90 → 1616.92] So brothers and sisters
[1616.92 → 1618.02] of Emanuel CRC
[1618.02 → 1618.68] and anybody else
[1618.68 → 1619.78] watching online right now,
[1620.46 → 1621.36] please remember this,
[1621.42 → 1623.74] that God is more powerful
[1623.74 → 1625.88] than we can ever comprehend.
[1627.36 → 1628.58] And may we be deeply,
[1628.82 → 1629.80] deeply affected
[1629.80 → 1631.84] by the infinite distance
[1631.84 → 1632.48] there is
[1632.48 → 1634.14] between God's power
[1634.14 → 1635.42] and our own.
[1635.42 → 1637.26] Second,
[1637.40 → 1638.46] God is deeply
[1638.46 → 1639.56] concerned
[1639.56 → 1640.86] for you.
[1642.18 → 1643.00] No matter what
[1643.00 → 1643.88] you are going through,
[1644.80 → 1645.66] God is listening,
[1645.86 → 1646.60] God is watching,
[1646.76 → 1647.36] He is hearing,
[1647.48 → 1648.22] and He is remembering
[1648.22 → 1649.44] His promises to you.
[1650.70 → 1651.74] He is with you always
[1651.74 → 1653.08] to the very end
[1653.08 → 1653.82] of the age.
[1655.26 → 1656.02] And finally,
[1656.10 → 1656.56] God is not
[1656.56 → 1657.72] calling you
[1657.72 → 1658.66] because you are qualified.
[1660.38 → 1661.86] He qualifies you
[1661.86 → 1663.22] to fulfill
[1663.22 → 1664.46] His calling.
[1665.42 → 1666.58] Don't mix those up.
[1667.96 → 1668.40] Amen?
[1669.96 → 1670.98] Let me pray with you.
[1671.24 → 1671.68] Father God,
[1671.96 → 1673.32] we thank You
[1673.32 → 1673.92] for this story.
[1674.02 → 1674.38] We thank You
[1674.38 → 1674.94] for Moses
[1674.94 → 1676.02] and the burning bush.
[1676.24 → 1676.74] We thank You
[1676.74 → 1677.84] for the power
[1677.84 → 1679.64] that comes
[1679.64 → 1680.42] through this story.
[1681.12 → 1681.70] We thank You
[1681.70 → 1682.46] for Your concern
[1682.46 → 1683.18] for Your people,
[1683.46 → 1684.38] why You came down
[1684.38 → 1685.14] in Egypt,
[1685.34 → 1686.12] why You came down
[1686.12 → 1686.76] in Bethlehem,
[1686.88 → 1687.62] why You came down
[1687.62 → 1688.32] at Pentecost.
[1690.08 → 1690.64] And God,
[1690.68 → 1691.14] we thank You
[1691.14 → 1692.56] that You are with us.
[1692.56 → 1694.20] You are powerfully,
[1694.78 → 1696.50] concerningly with us.
[1698.24 → 1698.68] And so God,
[1698.74 → 1700.26] may we respond accordingly.
[1700.38 → 1701.02] May we know
[1701.02 → 1702.60] that You are in charge
[1702.60 → 1703.34] of all things,
[1704.48 → 1705.92] that You are thinking of us,
[1705.98 → 1707.34] have us in Your heart,
[1707.70 → 1708.72] and that You call us
[1708.72 → 1709.62] to live lives
[1709.62 → 1710.96] of love and service
[1710.96 → 1711.68] and gratitude
[1711.68 → 1712.60] in this world.
[1713.12 → 1714.48] So may we boldly
[1714.48 → 1715.52] step forward
[1715.52 → 1716.70] in that knowledge.
[1717.48 → 1718.32] May we go forward
[1718.32 → 1719.54] knowing that You are with us
[1719.54 → 1721.50] and that You qualify us
[1721.50 → 1722.52] to live out this calling.
[1723.26 → 1724.32] But let us make excuses.
[1727.28 → 1727.94] Let us live
[1727.94 → 1728.72] as You call us to live.
[1728.76 → 1729.18] We pray this
[1729.18 → 1730.28] in Your Son's precious name.
[1730.56 → 1730.78] Amen.
