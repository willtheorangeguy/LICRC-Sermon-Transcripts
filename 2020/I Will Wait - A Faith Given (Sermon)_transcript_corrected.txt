[0.00 → 4.42] As John has prayed, we're going to spend some time opening up God's Word together.
[4.90 → 11.14] This morning, we're going to do that in Luke 1. We're going to start at verse 26, and then we'll
[11.14 → 18.12] read through verse 45. That will be on the screen as we go through it, but I do encourage you at
[18.12 → 23.98] home, especially if you've got a Bible handy, to grab one, open it up, turn to Luke 1, and read
[23.98 → 31.14] along with us. And maybe even, if you're feeling extra engaged or engaging this morning, grab a pen
[31.14 → 35.34] and some paper, take some notes, jot down some questions, and feel free to reach out to me
[35.34 → 39.48] throughout the week with any thoughts, ideas, or questions you might have as we go through this
[39.48 → 41.98] together. Let's read from Luke 1.
[41.98 → 56.28] In the sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee, to a virgin pledged
[56.28 → 64.14] to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin's name was Mary. The angel
[64.14 → 71.18] went to her and said, Greetings, you who are highly favoured. The Lord is with you. Mary was greatly
[71.18 → 77.40] troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be. But the angel said to her,
[77.80 → 85.12] Do not be afraid, Mary. You have found favour with God. You will be with child and give birth to a son,
[85.34 → 92.56] and you are to give him the name Jesus. And he will be great and will be called Son of the Most High.
[93.10 → 99.06] The Lord your God will give him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of
[99.06 → 108.24] Jacob forever. His kingdom will never end. How can this be? Mary asked the angel, since I am a virgin.
[109.36 → 115.48] The angel answered, The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will
[115.48 → 123.50] overshadow you. And so the Holy One to be born will be called the Son of God. Even Elizabeth,
[123.50 → 128.38] your relative, your relative, is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was said to be
[128.38 → 137.06] barren is in her sixth month, for nothing is impossible with God. I am the Lord's servant,
[137.44 → 145.30] Mary said. May it be to me as you have said. Then the angel left her. And at that time,
[145.68 → 151.24] Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea, where she entered Zachariah's home
[151.24 → 157.36] and greeted Elizabeth. When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb,
[157.50 → 164.02] and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. In a loud voice, she exclaimed, Blessed are you among
[164.02 → 171.20] women, and blessed is the child you will bear. But why am I so favoured that the mother of my Lord
[171.20 → 178.82] should come to me? As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb
[178.82 → 187.86] leaped for joy. Blessed is she who has believed that what the Lord has said to her will be accomplished.
[188.82 → 190.12] This is the word of the Lord.
[195.60 → 202.88] Now, as many of you watching this will know, that this was a particularly hard week in the life of
[202.88 → 210.42] our church and in the broader community of those who we know and love. We said goodbye to a husband,
[210.74 → 218.90] a father, a teacher, and a friend. Dave was known by so many, and he was loved by everyone who knew him.
[219.92 → 226.16] And that was a huge part of our experience this past week, and it was a defining experience for us,
[226.30 → 232.62] for sure. But as John has already indicated in his prayer, there's also so much more that we lift
[232.62 → 237.82] before the Lord. There's so much more that causes us to cry out and to wonder. There's so much more
[237.82 → 241.10] that makes us just fall down and cry.
[243.78 → 250.70] There's so much more that for many of us this past week was just an emotional disaster.
[252.22 → 258.44] Add to that everything else bigger than us going on, right? COVID cases continue to climb.
[258.44 → 265.28] We have new diagnoses of COVID in our community as we prayed. Families are strained, and relationships
[265.28 → 271.28] are cracking under the weight of everything that's going on. Unemployment continues to sit at around
[271.28 → 278.24] 8.5 percent, and that's down from a record high just a few months ago. Youth unemployment still sits
[278.24 → 287.82] at 20 percent, plus whatever you've got going on personally. It's so hard right now. And yet,
[288.02 → 297.86] by the grace of God, as I've been walking and talking and connecting with so many people over
[297.86 → 306.94] these past couple weeks of my starting here, so many of you just seem to be buoyed in the midst of all of
[306.94 → 315.44] this, right? You continue to be encouraged, and you continue to be encouraging. Somehow, you are so much
[315.44 → 322.16] more than your struggle or hardship. And now, don't get me wrong, all right? I want to be really clear
[322.16 → 328.76] here. I'm not saying that we walk above the fray, right? Some of us are living in it day by day, and
[328.76 → 335.12] really that's all we can do is go day by day, moment by moment. Some of us have been in the stuff of this
[335.12 → 342.66] chaos and life for weeks and months and years, even before this global pandemic, right? I'm not saying
[342.66 → 349.08] that life has been easy or that life should be easy. I'm not saying that we pretend that life is easy.
[350.22 → 357.72] What I'm saying is that there's something in you, there's something about you and available to you
[357.72 → 364.50] that makes you able to push through, that makes you able to stand, that makes you able to endure
[364.50 → 378.32] and persevere. And somehow, often, that thing that makes you able to stand doesn't make sense.
[378.86 → 385.14] It doesn't make sense to the people around you who don't know what it is, the people who don't have it,
[385.14 → 390.88] who don't understand it, but when they see it in you and when they see it active in your life,
[390.98 → 396.98] they want something of it or something like it. Sometimes you can't put that into words, right?
[397.10 → 404.78] Even when you try. Sometimes it doesn't make sense to you, and yet there it is, spurring you along,
[405.16 → 410.58] holding you up, whispering to your heart words of encouragement and hope.
[410.58 → 418.56] Do you know what I'm talking about? Have you figured out what I'm referring to?
[420.36 → 428.06] I'm talking about faith, right? As Christians, we have faith. Faith in God, faith in Jesus,
[428.28 → 434.72] faith in His plan, faith in His rule, faith in His word, faith in His power. As Christians,
[434.72 → 443.94] you have a gift, a way of seeing and being in the world that isn't of this world but is so for this
[443.94 → 451.26] world that He came into it to save it for Himself. That's what I want us to talk about this morning,
[452.34 → 460.66] right? The nature and the gift of faith for us as Christians. And to do that, we're going to use
[460.66 → 470.06] this amazing story about two women from Luke 1, Mary and Elizabeth. These two women are examples of
[470.06 → 478.00] faith in the face of the impossible, right? Not just in the face of the unlikely, not just in the face of
[478.00 → 484.18] the improbable, but in the face of the impossible, right? And what we begin to see is that faith is more
[484.18 → 491.34] than a set of propositions we assent to, but faith is a way of living and being in the world that is
[491.34 → 499.02] full of conviction and purpose and power and confidence in God, even when it doesn't necessarily
[499.02 → 510.14] make sense. There's a 17th century French mathematician and scientist and philosopher by the
[510.14 → 517.48] name of Pascal. And Pascal, in his famous collection of thoughts, it's really the magnum opus of his
[517.48 → 526.48] work and life as he collected these sayings over the course of that life, he has a phrase that just rings
[526.48 → 533.20] true to me at this moment and for this. And he talks about, in his thoughts, reasons of the heart.
[533.20 → 540.30] Right? It comes out of his, uh, pennies number 277, if you want to look it up. It says,
[540.68 → 548.00] the heart has its reasons which reason does not understand. The heart has its reasons which reason
[548.00 → 554.54] does not understand. And by reasons from the heart, what he means is, and this is from 282,
[554.54 → 563.90] thought 282, we know the truth not only by reason but also by the heart. Right? Reasons from the heart
[563.90 → 570.32] are not irrational feelings nor are they simply logical propositions. Instead, reasons from the heart
[570.32 → 578.04] not only give some light to the mind but are also existentially comforting and also satisfying
[578.04 → 587.52] to our souls. A reason from the heart affects and changes attitudes and actions. And when I think of
[587.52 → 594.84] Christian faith, I think of it in that sort of manner. Right? Not just the faith, kind of referring
[594.84 → 601.32] to a set of ideas or traditions that are handed down, although that's part of it and that's what makes
[601.32 → 608.82] up some parts and informs our understanding of faith, but it's also a conviction of the heart.
[609.14 → 615.08] Right? Faith isn't irrational or faith isn't a suspension of the critical faculties, but faith is
[615.08 → 621.50] alongside of reason and informed by reason and in many ways undergirded by reason, but ultimately,
[622.10 → 624.58] faith transcends reason.
[624.58 → 632.90] faith transcends reason. The rationality of God, the creator of the world, coming into the world by
[632.90 → 641.90] being born as a baby to an unwed teenage girl doesn't make sense. It's not rational. And yet,
[641.90 → 651.56] in the drama of redemption, it's the only thing that does make sense. And Mary and Elizabeth help us see
[651.56 → 660.52] that. Now, the first reason that I love Mary and Elizabeth as an example of faith is because of the
[660.52 → 669.56] contrast that exists between who they are. Now, Mary is young, probably just a teenager. She's unmarried.
[670.32 → 678.92] She's effectively a little girl. She lives in Nazareth, which has a reputation for being that town.
[678.92 → 686.92] Now, everywhere you live around the world, there's always one of those towns or cities that you think
[686.92 → 692.26] of as that place, right, where the people are just a little bit strange. They're a little bit outside.
[692.38 → 697.60] I haven't learned what that is yet here for us in Langley, but I'm sure there is one, and I'm sure
[697.60 → 705.08] you're thinking it right now. Nazareth is that town, right? Has anything good ever come from Nazareth?
[705.08 → 713.72] Contrast Mary from Nazareth with Elizabeth, who is old, well beyond childbearing years, we read.
[714.68 → 722.28] And she is the wife of a prominent priest, right? Both her and Zachariah, her husband, are descendants of
[722.28 → 731.42] Aaron, right, giving them a strong lineage and a prominent place in society. Luke 1, before what we
[731.42 → 737.40] read, actually tells us that both her and Zachariah are, quote, upright in the sight of God, observing
[737.40 → 741.28] all the Lord's commandments and regulations blamelessly.
[744.22 → 752.70] She lives in the hill country of Judea, which is a kind of way of saying in the area around Jerusalem,
[753.42 → 760.36] right? Maybe she even lives in the priestly city of Hebron. Point is, she is close to the religious
[760.36 → 766.54] and political centre of it all. The contrast between these two women can't be more stark,
[767.14 → 778.00] and yet they are each a picture of faith at the moment. Mary trusts God's word and submits herself
[778.00 → 785.72] to it. She says, may it be to me as you have said. And Elizabeth, and catch this, Elizabeth submits
[785.72 → 793.84] herself to Mary's privilege over her. Don't miss the power in that inversion, right? When Elizabeth says,
[794.00 → 801.16] blessed are you among women, but why am I so favoured that the mother of my Lord should come to me? And
[801.16 → 810.22] then the baby in her leaps for joy at the relation to the just-conceived Jesus. Now, in these two women,
[810.22 → 818.22] there is a picture of community, a picture, I think, of the church, right? Inclusive of all God's chosen
[818.22 → 826.46] children, from the single, outcast, probably poor mom-to-be, to the matriarch of a community deferring her privilege
[826.46 → 840.58] to this young girl. Faith looks like an inclusive community full of humility, and God uses both of
[840.58 → 851.32] these women. Latin American Bible scholar and teacher, Just Gonzalez, holds up Elizabeth as an example of
[851.32 → 858.82] the faithfulness to God's mission, because when she comes face to face with a marginalized, pregnant,
[859.24 → 867.30] young, unwed woman, she recognizes in her God at work. And instead of judgment, instead of moral
[867.30 → 872.26] posturing, instead of virtue signalling, which she could have done because she is morally blameless and
[872.26 → 879.26] part of the priestly class, instead of all that, she rejoices in humility, and she welcomes this mother-to-be.
[881.32 → 887.08] Now, if that's not a picture of faith in the church, I don't know what is, and it comes from these two
[887.08 → 895.70] women. Now, Gonzalez will actually take this idea further and says that in the world today, one of the
[895.70 → 904.18] main obstacles to evangelism, to talking about Jesus and sharing the gospel and increasing the number of
[904.18 → 909.94] those who believe, one of the main obstacles to evangelism in the world, Gonzalez says, is Christians.
[909.94 → 918.40] Christians, who instead of announcing good news of grace and salvation, focus on the bad news of
[918.40 → 927.72] condemnation and eternal damnation, which is perhaps what James means when he says in chapter 1, verse 20 of
[927.72 → 934.08] his little letter, the wrath of God does not produce, or the wrath of man does not produce the righteousness
[934.08 → 944.64] of God. And Elizabeth paints for us a different picture of what could be. And maybe even, as we pull out from that,
[944.96 → 951.58] mothers generally give us a good picture of what faith and humility could be.
[953.20 → 959.62] God seems to think that that's true, because there are a bunch of times throughout Scripture that he likens his love
[959.62 → 963.28] and his action in the world to that of a mother for her children.
[966.30 → 971.92] Maybe as you hear that, what you're thinking is that after the service today, you need to talk to your mom,
[972.94 → 978.64] and you need to thank her for the ways that she revealed God to you. Maybe you need to turn to her
[978.64 → 984.78] right now and just say, I love you. But what we see in Mary and Elizabeth, what we see in Elizabeth
[984.78 → 994.18] welcoming Mary is a picture for us of faith given. The second reason that I love Mary and Elizabeth as
[994.18 → 1002.40] examples of faith is because of where they are ultimately putting their faith. Notice in verse 37,
[1002.52 → 1008.96] right, we read, for nothing is impossible with God. Now, if you have another translation of the Bible,
[1008.96 → 1016.20] it might say something like, no word of God will ever fail at that moment. And it's because it's a bit
[1016.20 → 1021.58] of a complicated sentence in the original Greek. The way that I would translate that more literally
[1021.58 → 1030.94] is to say, for nothing will be impossible from God's every word. Right, they're rooting their faith
[1030.94 → 1038.20] in the very words of God himself. Right, and the word of God here given to us in the Bible,
[1038.20 → 1044.88] and the word of God spoken at the formation of the world has the power to say to nothing and out into
[1044.88 → 1054.06] darkness, let there be light. And there was light. God speaks, and the world is created. God speaks
[1054.06 → 1066.42] and your heart is recreated. It is the word of God that gives promise and authority and is absolutely
[1066.42 → 1078.90] true. Mary puts her faith in the word of God, which will accomplish exactly what God sends it out for.
[1079.16 → 1085.98] It will not return to him empty, says Isaiah. And Elizabeth does the same, and she confirms it for us
[1085.98 → 1092.90] when she says, right, in verse 45, blessed is she who has believed what the Lord has said to her
[1092.90 → 1098.64] will be accomplished. Again, in another translation, differently of translating that, it says,
[1098.92 → 1105.02] blessed is she who has believed that the Lord would fulfill his promises to her.
[1106.16 → 1113.16] Right, the promises here are not just what the angel Gabriel speaks to Mary or has spoken to Zechariah,
[1113.26 → 1120.16] but the entire Old Testament as it anticipates the coming of the Messiah King, the suffering servant.
[1120.16 → 1128.02] Right, the promises that Elizabeth is resting her faith on are the same promises that God now speaks to our hearts.
[1130.08 → 1138.00] The promises of God, the word of God, might just turn out to be the reasons of the heart
[1138.00 → 1142.92] for why you believe what you believe, why you endure what you can endure.
[1142.92 → 1152.30] Why, even when we walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
[1153.34 → 1158.68] we can fear no evil, for we know that God is with us.
[1159.84 → 1164.54] Why, even when in this world, like Jesus says, we will have trouble, we can take heart,
[1164.90 → 1169.18] we can be strong and courageous because Jesus has overcome the world.
[1169.18 → 1173.46] Why, even though we may have suffered for a little time,
[1174.10 → 1180.88] we can persevere because we're born again into a living hope.
[1180.88 → 1184.88] The promise of God's word.
[1185.78 → 1190.12] The promise of God's word that spoke all creation into being,
[1190.18 → 1194.32] the promise of God's word which takes your heart dead in sin
[1194.32 → 1201.16] and breathes new life into it and transforms you now into the image of his son, Jesus Christ,
[1201.22 → 1204.36] as he has won for us the victory over sin and death.
[1204.36 → 1209.06] The promise of God's word applied to you as a gift in the work of the Holy Spirit
[1209.06 → 1213.50] for Jesus who lived the life I should have lived and died the death that I deserve
[1213.50 → 1217.86] has called me his own, has united me to the Father
[1217.86 → 1222.86] that I may be a child of God and a co-heir with Christ.
[1223.92 → 1229.68] The promise of God in his word applied by the Holy Spirit
[1229.68 → 1236.12] is the reason of the heart for why I endure, for why you endure.
[1238.90 → 1248.20] There is a lie that has been perpetuated in certain Christian circles and traditions
[1248.20 → 1252.82] that says, if you have enough faith, you will be healed.
[1253.34 → 1257.50] If you have enough faith, God will bless you with material blessing.
[1257.50 → 1262.56] That if you have enough faith, you will get everything that you want
[1262.56 → 1266.84] and all your heart's desire will be yours if you just claim it by faith.
[1269.66 → 1274.28] That is a lie of the devil.
[1278.32 → 1282.50] Faith is ultimately not about how much you have,
[1282.50 → 1286.90] but it's about who it is in.
[1289.60 → 1294.00] There's a story in Luke 17 where the disciples come to Jesus
[1294.00 → 1296.88] and they say, Lord, increase our faith.
[1298.34 → 1300.98] And Jesus turns to them, and do you remember what he says?
[1301.14 → 1304.64] He says, if you had faith the size of a mustard seed,
[1304.84 → 1306.44] you could say to this small bear tree,
[1306.68 → 1309.24] be pulled up by its roots and be planted in the sea,
[1309.24 → 1310.58] and it would obey you.
[1311.62 → 1314.32] Now, I don't know if you've ever seen a mustard seed,
[1315.28 → 1319.26] but maybe go to your pepper shaker
[1319.26 → 1322.42] and pour out some pepper into your hand.
[1324.00 → 1328.40] One grain of ground pepper
[1328.40 → 1331.52] is the size of a mustard seed.
[1331.52 → 1336.44] You see, it's not ultimately about how much faith you have,
[1336.56 → 1339.02] it's about who your faith is in.
[1340.14 → 1342.30] It's not even about the content of your faith,
[1342.36 → 1345.16] so much as it is about the object of your faith.
[1348.08 → 1351.82] There's an illustration that's used by Tim Keller.
[1352.70 → 1356.22] He says, if you are falling down the face of a cliff
[1356.22 → 1360.20] and the only thing jutting out from that faith is a branch,
[1360.58 → 1363.00] an old tree that has somehow found root
[1363.00 → 1365.30] and grabbed itself on the side of this cliff faith,
[1365.38 → 1366.18] and you are falling,
[1366.42 → 1368.88] and the only way to save yourself from falling
[1368.88 → 1370.32] is to grab onto that branch,
[1370.46 → 1373.46] it doesn't matter how much faith you have in the branch.
[1374.50 → 1375.74] What matters is the branch.
[1377.48 → 1380.22] So it is with us as Christians.
[1381.40 → 1383.46] It doesn't matter how much faith we have,
[1383.46 → 1386.00] it matters who our faith is in.
[1386.32 → 1388.54] That's why we call faith a gift,
[1388.60 → 1391.94] because it comes from the one in whom our faith is.
[1392.68 → 1396.34] That's why we can read, right, in Timothy,
[1396.50 → 1397.98] that when we are faithless,
[1398.10 → 1400.98] he is faithful because he cannot disown himself.
[1401.32 → 1402.74] That is the promise of faith.
[1403.00 → 1404.48] That is the promise of God's Word.
[1405.94 → 1408.58] That Jesus holds you fast.
[1409.64 → 1412.96] That Jesus carries you through.
[1413.46 → 1419.06] That Jesus will make you persevere.
[1421.32 → 1423.64] In the Reformed Church,
[1423.80 → 1426.86] we call ourselves a confessional church.
[1427.66 → 1428.94] And what we mean by that
[1428.94 → 1431.28] is we have a certain number of documents
[1431.28 → 1433.96] that we hold out as accurate
[1433.96 → 1437.12] and succinct summaries of the Christian faith.
[1437.12 → 1440.78] And one of those that has emerged to the fore for us
[1440.78 → 1443.92] as part of our binding and confessional identity
[1443.92 → 1445.68] is the Heidelberg Catechism.
[1446.68 → 1449.78] Question and answer 21 of the Heidelberg Catechism asks,
[1450.04 → 1452.04] what is true faith?
[1452.08 → 1453.98] And it gives this beautiful answer.
[1455.06 → 1455.44] It says,
[1455.58 → 1458.58] true faith is not only a sure knowledge
[1458.58 → 1460.44] by which I hold as true
[1460.44 → 1462.74] all that God has revealed to us in Scripture.
[1462.74 → 1465.40] And so that's the part of faith that is content,
[1465.62 → 1466.52] that is tradition,
[1466.64 → 1467.26] that is doctrine,
[1467.38 → 1468.20] that is teaching.
[1468.42 → 1470.04] But the Catechism continues,
[1470.54 → 1474.70] it is also a wholehearted trust.
[1476.08 → 1479.04] Now that reads to me like the language of Pascal,
[1479.92 → 1481.68] a reason of the heart.
[1481.68 → 1485.44] It is also a reason of the heart,
[1485.80 → 1488.98] which the Holy Spirit creates in me by the gospel,
[1489.38 → 1491.68] that God has freely granted,
[1491.82 → 1492.66] not only others,
[1492.78 → 1495.36] but to me also forgiveness of sins,
[1495.54 → 1496.36] eternal righteousness,
[1496.68 → 1497.46] and salvation.
[1497.84 → 1499.84] And then the Catechism ends in saying,
[1500.32 → 1503.44] these are gifts of sheer grace,
[1503.88 → 1507.48] granted solely by Christ's merit.
[1507.48 → 1511.70] Faith is a gift.
[1513.30 → 1514.90] Belief in the gospel
[1514.90 → 1517.02] and the strength to endure
[1517.02 → 1520.10] is a gift of God.
[1520.94 → 1524.56] Mary and Elizabeth show us
[1524.56 → 1527.64] that gift in practice.
[1529.94 → 1532.14] There are so many people in your lives
[1532.14 → 1534.92] who have revealed the gift of faith,
[1534.92 → 1537.80] who have spoken and lived
[1537.80 → 1539.44] and been present in times
[1539.44 → 1541.68] and situations and circumstances
[1541.68 → 1543.22] where you would have,
[1543.36 → 1544.06] on your own,
[1544.22 → 1544.82] fallen apart.
[1545.88 → 1547.72] But they have been
[1547.72 → 1551.84] part of your faith story.
[1553.10 → 1554.40] So as we go today,
[1554.54 → 1557.60] as we wait for the coming of our Lord Jesus
[1557.60 → 1558.72] in this Christmas season,
[1559.06 → 1560.72] I want to leave you with this.
[1562.76 → 1564.22] Think about those people.
[1564.92 → 1566.12] Think about those people
[1566.12 → 1567.22] who have been Mary and Elizabeth
[1567.22 → 1569.06] to you in your life,
[1569.12 → 1570.58] who have led you
[1570.58 → 1572.62] and revealed faith to you.
[1573.26 → 1574.24] And thank God for them.
[1575.16 → 1575.64] And maybe,
[1575.86 → 1576.56] if you have the courage,
[1576.68 → 1578.14] thank them for them.
[1579.20 → 1579.72] Text them.
[1580.22 → 1580.70] Call them.
[1581.18 → 1581.92] Connect with them.
[1582.62 → 1582.94] And say,
[1583.06 → 1586.26] thank you for revealing faith to me.
[1586.58 → 1588.46] Thank you for having faith in me
[1588.46 → 1589.98] when I had none in myself.
[1590.18 → 1593.18] Thank you for revealing Jesus to me
[1593.18 → 1595.68] when I was in the dark night of the soul,
[1595.98 → 1597.84] when I was in the valley of the shadow.
[1597.98 → 1599.94] Thank you for being a reason
[1599.94 → 1601.82] from the heart.
[1602.94 → 1604.16] And then as you go
[1604.16 → 1605.52] and as you think about those people,
[1605.64 → 1606.40] ask yourselves,
[1606.70 → 1608.66] for whom are you
[1608.66 → 1612.06] that reason from the heart?
[1613.38 → 1614.52] Who are you impacting
[1614.52 → 1616.44] with the life of faith?
[1616.44 → 1620.90] And who will you be God's messenger for?
[1622.60 → 1624.64] Because as we go together in community,
[1624.78 → 1626.82] even though we are distant and apart,
[1626.92 → 1628.94] even though we can't sit in proximity
[1628.94 → 1630.10] in the way that we like,
[1630.38 → 1631.88] even though we can't hug each other
[1631.88 → 1632.54] as we would want
[1632.54 → 1633.46] or share a meal
[1633.46 → 1636.30] as we might so deeply desire,
[1636.68 → 1638.72] even though none of those things are true,
[1638.72 → 1640.26] what remains true
[1640.26 → 1643.74] is that the object of our faith
[1643.74 → 1646.56] has overcome the world.
[1647.88 → 1648.90] And in him,
[1649.54 → 1651.54] we can trust.
[1652.32 → 1654.06] He is our reason
[1654.06 → 1655.38] from the heart.
[1656.08 → 1656.82] Let's pray together.
[1660.42 → 1661.44] Lord Jesus,
[1662.04 → 1663.70] we thank you
[1663.70 → 1666.10] for speaking so clearly
[1666.10 → 1668.40] to us today.
[1669.06 → 1669.82] We thank you
[1669.82 → 1671.34] for being in us
[1671.34 → 1672.20] and for us
[1672.20 → 1672.98] the reason
[1672.98 → 1674.22] from the heart.
[1675.48 → 1676.42] We thank you
[1676.42 → 1677.54] for the gift of faith.
[1678.78 → 1679.26] And today,
[1679.38 → 1679.84] in particular,
[1680.02 → 1680.56] we thank you
[1680.56 → 1681.24] for those people
[1681.24 → 1682.84] who have been for us
[1682.84 → 1684.16] a gift in faith.
[1685.04 → 1685.60] Those people
[1685.60 → 1686.44] who have drawn near
[1686.44 → 1687.34] and surrounded us
[1687.34 → 1687.90] with love
[1687.90 → 1689.34] when we felt alone
[1689.34 → 1689.74] and empty.
[1689.84 → 1690.38] For those people
[1690.38 → 1692.24] who have lifted us up
[1692.24 → 1694.44] when we couldn't
[1694.44 → 1695.14] carry ourselves.
[1696.10 → 1697.92] for those
[1697.92 → 1698.76] who have been Mary
[1698.76 → 1699.72] and those who have been
[1699.72 → 1701.22] Elizabeth in our lives.
[1701.72 → 1702.74] We thank you.
[1704.06 → 1704.52] And so,
[1704.66 → 1705.24] may we go
[1705.24 → 1705.76] together
[1705.76 → 1706.64] into this week
[1706.64 → 1707.22] to live
[1707.22 → 1708.64] by faith.
[1710.22 → 1711.58] That as we look back,
[1711.86 → 1712.74] we can be assured
[1712.74 → 1715.08] so that we may go forward
[1715.08 → 1716.04] in confidence
[1716.04 → 1716.76] and conviction
[1716.76 → 1717.70] that you
[1717.70 → 1718.78] are God alone
[1718.78 → 1719.62] and that you,
[1720.16 → 1720.58] Lord Jesus,
[1720.76 → 1721.92] will never leave us
[1721.92 → 1723.32] nor forsake us.
[1723.32 → 1726.70] in Christ alone
[1726.70 → 1727.28] we pray.
[1728.72 → 1729.06] Amen.
[1729.06 → 1729.20] Amen.
[1730.20 → 1730.58] Amen.
