[0.00 → 11.30] there thanks Kevin for leading us in that prayer as Kevin said we're going to open
[11.30 → 17.16] God's word together, and I think the text that I'm going to read is on the screen as we go through
[17.16 → 23.38] it, but I do really want to encourage everyone especially if you're at home to do two things
[23.38 → 30.72] one grab a bible and read along that way and keep that bible with you and open and two if you're
[30.72 → 36.48] feeling particularly adventurous in your engagement of worship this morning grab a journal or a notebook
[36.48 → 43.04] to write down some notes or some questions or reflections that you have as we go through and
[43.04 → 47.90] think about how you can take those and talk about them in your household afterwards, or maybe you can
[47.90 → 53.96] email me or call me this week, and we can have a discussion about all of that but a bible and a
[53.96 → 60.24] notebook I think are great ways to just intentionally engage in this time of worship in God's word
[60.24 → 69.14] together we're going to read from Isaiah 9 I'm going to read verse 2 through verse 7 these are really
[69.14 → 76.06] familiar verses for many of us regularly read in the season of advent, but we want to try to come at them
[76.06 → 82.46] this morning with fresh eyes and a fresh heart to see what God might say let me read this with you
[82.46 → 92.52] people walking in darkness have seen a great light on those living in the land of the shadow of death
[92.52 → 101.24] a light has dawned you have enlarged the nation and increased their joy they rejoice before you as
[101.24 → 108.18] people rejoice at the harvest as men rejoice when dividing the plunder for as in the day of Median's
[108.18 → 113.72] defeat you have shattered the yoke that burdens them the bar across their shoulders the rod of their
[113.72 → 119.24] oppressor every warrior's boot used in battle and every garment rolled in blood will be destined for
[119.24 → 129.66] burning will be fueled for the fire for to us a child is born to us a son is given and the government
[129.66 → 136.36] will be on his shoulders and he will be called wonderful counsellor mighty God everlasting father
[136.36 → 144.30] and prince of peace of the increase of his government and peace there will be no end he will reign on
[144.30 → 150.72] David's throne and over his kingdom establishing and upholding it with justice and righteous from that
[150.72 → 159.68] time on and forever the zeal of the Lord Almighty will accomplish this is the word of the Lord
[159.68 → 173.14] now two weeks ago I was driving across this vast country with my family now you may not know my family
[173.14 → 182.56] yet but let me tell you my kids don't do long distance travelling well so you can imagine what we were
[182.56 → 189.84] feeling as parents before we began that trip together all right I got a five-year-old and a seven-year-old
[189.84 → 197.84] trapped in the van for what ended up being 62 hours and 4,875 kilometres
[197.84 → 206.20] at best we might feel like Harry Potter trapped under the stairs of the Dursley house at 4 Privet Drive
[206.20 → 213.46] at worst we might end up feeling like characters in a Saw movie trying to figure out the only way to survive
[213.46 → 227.20] add to it all while we were driving we learned that Manitoba was closed to visitors
[227.20 → 229.70] and so we had to drive straight through
[229.70 → 236.82] while we were driving we learned the day before that we were scheduled to drive through western
[236.82 → 242.48] Saskatchewan and into southeastern Alberta that they got hit with a 50 centimetre dumping of snow
[242.48 → 249.68] we got to Moose Jaw it was minus 22 degrees Celsius
[249.68 → 254.52] we woke up in Medicine Hat it was minus 20 degrees
[254.52 → 259.58] if you don't know me I'm not built for cold
[259.58 → 265.90] I will take the west coast rain any day over the cold
[265.90 → 274.62] and with all of that and with kids who don't drive well unless you throw snacks or an iPad at them
[274.62 → 277.68] how were we going to survive
[277.68 → 282.04] by the grace of God absolutely amen we counted on that
[282.04 → 285.06] but also by looking ahead
[285.06 → 288.38] right to get across Manitoba
[288.38 → 292.48] we cast a vision for what we would be able to do when we reached Regina
[292.48 → 297.12] right to get through the prairies and the cold of Alberta
[297.12 → 300.36] we cast a vision for the Royal Tyrell Museum
[300.36 → 302.54] and we called it Dinosaur Day
[302.54 → 305.42] we talked about it with our kids on Dinosaur Day
[305.42 → 307.58] we're going to see this, and we're going to do this
[307.58 → 312.38] point is we held out a vision for something new and awesome
[312.38 → 314.48] that we could all put our hope in
[314.48 → 317.36] right when the days got long and our bums got sore
[317.36 → 319.58] we looked to a vision of the future
[319.58 → 324.88] when tempers got short and the ability to share became in short supply
[324.88 → 327.96] we held our hope of what was coming
[327.96 → 330.22] right just down the road
[330.22 → 331.76] just around the corner
[331.76 → 333.22] just in the next city
[333.22 → 334.74] and eventually we got to say
[334.74 → 337.02] and look there are the mountains
[337.02 → 340.62] hope for what is coming
[340.62 → 343.38] after the trial
[343.38 → 346.20] makes the trial endurable
[346.20 → 349.84] and that's true in the little things
[349.84 → 351.90] that's true in the middle things
[351.90 → 354.56] and that's true in the biggest things of life
[354.56 → 359.92] now I may not know you yet the way that I want to
[359.92 → 362.68] but I am sure of this
[362.68 → 365.42] we all need a little hope right now
[365.42 → 368.24] let's be real
[368.24 → 369.70] this sucks
[369.70 → 373.34] this isn't how I wanted to start with you
[373.34 → 376.42] this isn't what worship is supposed to look like
[376.42 → 377.92] this isn't what worship is supposed to be
[377.92 → 379.18] now don't get me wrong right
[379.18 → 380.34] we make it work
[380.34 → 381.28] and for some of us even
[381.28 → 382.86] this actually works pretty good
[382.86 → 386.10] right I'm sure there are some of us who like this format
[386.10 → 388.90] I once had a church member say to me
[388.90 → 392.40] I can come to church and hear 50% of what's said
[392.40 → 394.40] or I can stay home and hear it all
[394.40 → 396.70] right this person had hearing difficulties
[396.70 → 399.18] in large groups and in large spaces
[399.18 → 401.18] and so being able to sit in their living room
[401.18 → 403.38] with their TV and everything connected
[403.38 → 406.68] and their hearing aids tuned in to what was going on
[406.68 → 408.18] worked really well for them
[408.18 → 411.50] right, and we do our best as leaders
[411.50 → 415.30] to provide a meaningful encounter with God in worship
[415.30 → 417.38] but it's hard when we can't see you
[417.38 → 419.70] right it's hard for you
[419.70 → 421.32] when you're sitting in the same space
[421.32 → 423.06] that you watch football or hockey
[423.06 → 424.22] or The Bachelor in
[424.22 → 427.86] right it's easy to become a passive consumer
[427.86 → 430.14] of a church product when your engagement
[430.14 → 431.80] is through a remote and a screen
[431.80 → 434.32] and we want more than that for you
[434.32 → 436.82] we want more than that for our lives of faith
[436.82 → 443.68] and so really in the providence of God's hand at work
[443.68 → 449.18] Advent is exactly the time and the season that we need right now
[449.18 → 453.46] Advent is waiting based on hope
[453.46 → 457.52] Advent is expectation of something more
[457.52 → 460.04] when the days get short and the nights get dark
[460.04 → 464.18] Advent is a longing in the human heart to belong
[464.18 → 467.04] Advent is for new beginnings and a new hope
[467.04 → 469.66] Advent is for giving voice to the loneliness
[469.66 → 471.50] that we all feel right now
[471.50 → 473.34] and the longing for something more
[473.34 → 474.04] something greater
[474.04 → 474.98] something truer
[474.98 → 476.94] something deeper and more beautiful
[476.94 → 479.54] than whatever our current reality is
[479.54 → 484.02] because for some of us this current reality sucks
[484.02 → 486.82] and there's no other way to put it
[486.82 → 489.28] or maybe you're in a hospital
[489.28 → 491.06] or you're in a care home
[491.06 → 493.40] and you can't have visitors like you want
[493.40 → 495.78] maybe you're the one who wants to visit
[495.78 → 498.66] and you can't do that like you need to
[498.66 → 501.88] maybe you have other health issues
[501.88 → 503.94] and sure at least you are at home
[503.94 → 506.06] but people can't come and visit anymore
[506.06 → 507.18] and that sucks
[507.18 → 510.12] maybe you're a single parent
[510.12 → 512.10] who counted on community groups
[512.10 → 512.88] and church groups
[512.88 → 514.90] for that important connection
[514.90 → 516.92] and that important experience of community
[516.92 → 517.70] and now that's gone
[517.70 → 522.06] maybe it's as simple as a hug
[522.06 → 524.86] some of us just need a hug
[524.86 → 527.62] but we're told that we shouldn't do that right now
[527.62 → 530.36] and I love to cook
[530.36 → 534.16] and I love sharing that love with others
[534.16 → 536.30] I love hosting dinners and parties
[536.30 → 538.52] and we shouldn't do that right now
[538.52 → 540.94] and look let me be really clear okay
[540.94 → 543.20] I'm not speaking against the restrictions
[543.20 → 546.08] I understand the desire of the medical professionals
[546.08 → 546.94] and of the government
[546.94 → 547.86] I get it
[547.86 → 550.66] and I will submit to the ruling authority
[550.66 → 552.06] as the Bible commands me
[552.06 → 553.46] I will honour the king
[553.46 → 554.44] or the prime minister
[554.44 → 555.58] or the top doctors
[555.58 → 559.02] and I know that if we do this well right now
[559.02 → 561.22] it will be better and shorter for everyone
[561.22 → 563.96] but that doesn't make me like it
[563.96 → 566.36] it doesn't make this any easier
[566.36 → 569.90] right I can know all the rules
[569.90 → 571.84] I can trust the authority
[571.84 → 574.60] and the expertise of those who make the rules
[574.60 → 576.82] and I can know that right now
[576.82 → 578.46] this is exactly what it means
[578.46 → 579.44] to love our neighbours
[579.44 → 580.96] as Jesus has commanded us to
[580.96 → 582.70] I can know all these things
[582.70 → 585.72] and still need more in my heart
[585.72 → 587.38] I need hope
[587.38 → 590.20] we all need hope
[590.20 → 592.78] that's why I like Advent
[592.78 → 596.46] darkness and light
[596.46 → 598.72] chaos and hope
[598.72 → 600.68] need and fulfillment
[600.68 → 601.88] Advent you see
[601.88 → 604.10] isn't too much of an experience
[604.10 → 606.46] of the tension between the polarities
[606.46 → 609.46] as it is knowing that we walk through
[609.46 → 611.72] the valley of the shadow of death
[611.72 → 613.02] it's about knowing that
[613.02 → 615.40] following the dark night of the soul
[615.40 → 618.82] is a morning where God's mercies are new
[618.82 → 621.76] right here's the thing
[621.76 → 623.84] that Advent helps us understand
[623.84 → 625.20] about our humanity
[625.20 → 626.98] about being human
[626.98 → 631.90] what we believe about our future
[631.90 → 633.76] completely controls
[633.76 → 636.74] how we experience our present
[636.74 → 640.22] that's our theme for this morning
[640.22 → 642.16] what we believe about our future
[642.16 → 643.38] completely controls
[643.38 → 645.98] how we experience our present
[645.98 → 649.34] now I read something this week
[649.34 → 650.90] that said
[650.90 → 657.16] we are irreducibly hope-based creatures
[657.16 → 659.64] and I love that language
[659.64 → 660.06] right
[660.06 → 664.66] irreducibly hope-based creatures
[664.66 → 668.10] and since we are hope-based creatures
[668.10 → 670.30] we will always be putting our hope
[670.30 → 671.78] into something
[671.78 → 672.84] into someone
[672.84 → 674.78] we need hope
[674.78 → 676.56] we need a vision of the future
[676.56 → 679.06] that compels us to action
[679.06 → 681.50] that encourages us to endure
[681.50 → 682.68] that carries us
[682.68 → 685.40] when everything else is pushing us down
[685.40 → 688.12] and that's what Isaiah 9
[688.12 → 690.06] is for the people of Israel
[690.06 → 691.86] that's why Isaiah 9
[691.86 → 693.18] is so often picked up
[693.18 → 695.10] in this season of Advent
[695.10 → 695.82] right
[695.82 → 697.42] the verses of Isaiah 9
[697.42 → 698.16] that we read
[698.16 → 700.62] give us a compelling picture
[700.62 → 702.50] of a sustaining hope
[702.50 → 703.36] for the future
[703.36 → 705.00] in the face of trial
[705.00 → 708.08] because of who Isaiah 9
[708.08 → 710.28] is revealing to us
[710.28 → 711.52] and to our hearts
[711.52 → 713.48] look at it with me
[713.48 → 715.06] verse 2 says
[715.06 → 717.30] the people walking in darkness
[717.30 → 719.38] have seen a great light
[719.38 → 720.92] on those living in the land
[720.92 → 722.08] of the shadow of death
[722.08 → 724.10] a light has dawned
[724.10 → 727.42] Isaiah is a prophet
[727.42 → 729.66] in the court of the king
[729.66 → 730.60] in Judah
[730.60 → 732.30] the southern kingdom of Israel
[732.30 → 733.58] after the division
[733.58 → 734.80] in the court of Ahaz
[734.80 → 735.66] and then after him
[735.66 → 737.00] in the court of Hezekiah
[737.00 → 740.00] now at this time
[740.00 → 741.86] the northern kingdom of Israel
[741.86 → 744.08] is facing Assyrian invaders
[744.08 → 745.74] that will eventually destroy
[745.74 → 746.66] that kingdom
[746.66 → 747.76] and that northern
[747.76 → 749.28] those Assyrian invaders
[749.28 → 750.60] are pressing down
[750.60 → 751.34] towards Judah
[751.34 → 752.28] and they are threatening
[752.28 → 753.90] the existence of this kingdom
[753.90 → 755.50] in the south as well
[755.50 → 758.02] now Ahaz is considered
[758.02 → 760.50] in biblical canon
[760.50 → 762.08] to be a wicked king
[762.08 → 763.82] and Hezekiah after him
[763.82 → 764.88] is often considered
[764.88 → 765.92] to be a good king
[765.92 → 767.02] although near the end
[767.02 → 768.02] of Hezekiah's reign
[768.02 → 768.66] you can see
[768.66 → 770.88] a little bit of his selfishness
[770.88 → 771.92] creeping through
[771.92 → 773.40] point is
[773.40 → 774.48] during this time
[774.48 → 776.20] as Isaiah is speaking
[776.20 → 777.18] this prophecy
[777.18 → 779.04] corruption is prevalent
[779.04 → 781.50] destruction is on the horizon
[781.50 → 783.24] and Isaiah adds to that
[783.24 → 784.16] by prophesying
[784.16 → 785.56] about a coming exile
[785.56 → 786.60] that would happen
[786.60 → 787.60] a century later
[787.60 → 789.26] now Isaiah
[789.26 → 791.26] in his whole book
[791.26 → 792.42] addresses some pretty
[792.42 → 793.62] important questions
[793.62 → 795.34] right he asks
[795.34 → 796.16] if God
[796.16 → 797.40] is truly sovereign
[797.40 → 798.18] in history
[798.18 → 800.04] how do we believe that
[800.04 → 800.56] or know that
[800.56 → 801.70] when godless nations
[801.70 → 802.42] are stronger
[802.42 → 803.36] than God's nation
[803.36 → 805.10] or what role
[805.10 → 805.84] do God's people
[805.84 → 806.36] have to play
[806.36 → 806.92] in the world
[806.92 → 808.30] right is judgment
[808.30 → 808.88] from God
[808.88 → 809.86] the same as rejection
[809.86 → 810.58] from God
[810.58 → 811.98] or another way
[811.98 → 813.02] to put all of this
[813.02 → 813.76] right Isaiah
[813.76 → 814.92] is wrestling with the question
[814.92 → 816.26] where is God
[816.26 → 817.60] when bad things happen
[817.60 → 820.12] and that's exactly
[820.12 → 821.10] the kind of questions
[821.10 → 822.08] that so many of us
[822.08 → 823.20] are asking right now
[823.20 → 824.64] right not just
[824.64 → 825.76] with global pandemics
[825.76 → 826.80] like we're in the midst of
[826.80 → 828.28] but in really important
[828.28 → 829.34] conversations about
[829.34 → 831.14] race and justice
[831.14 → 831.98] and poverty
[831.98 → 832.72] and hunger
[832.72 → 834.06] and access to health care
[834.06 → 834.92] or clean water
[834.92 → 836.40] right where is God
[836.40 → 837.48] when it's darkest
[837.48 → 840.44] Isaiah 9
[840.44 → 842.26] comes with a particular
[842.26 → 842.96] answer
[842.96 → 845.82] John Calvin
[845.82 → 848.02] 16th century
[848.02 → 849.20] church reformer
[849.20 → 850.60] he summarizes
[850.60 → 851.42] verse 2
[851.42 → 852.36] by saying
[852.36 → 854.28] even in
[854.28 → 855.36] darkness
[855.36 → 857.44] in death itself
[857.44 → 858.64] there is nevertheless
[858.64 → 860.66] good ground of hope
[860.66 → 861.70] for the power
[861.70 → 862.32] of God
[862.32 → 863.08] is more
[863.08 → 864.48] than sufficient
[864.48 → 866.46] the power of God
[866.46 → 867.84] is more than sufficient
[867.84 → 870.40] that's why we can have hope
[870.40 → 871.70] and that's what makes
[871.70 → 872.66] you and me
[872.66 → 873.22] different
[873.22 → 874.06] from people
[874.06 → 875.14] who don't know
[875.14 → 876.64] God in Jesus
[876.64 → 877.34] that's what makes
[877.34 → 878.38] our hope
[878.38 → 878.98] different
[878.98 → 879.54] because you see
[879.54 → 880.46] our hope
[880.46 → 881.88] isn't in a vaccine
[881.88 → 883.00] though that will be
[883.00 → 883.84] a good thing
[883.84 → 884.80] and something to
[884.80 → 885.76] long for
[885.76 → 886.56] our hope
[886.56 → 887.58] isn't in a doctor
[887.58 → 888.74] or a health care
[888.74 → 889.96] or pharma care
[889.96 → 890.88] though those are all
[890.88 → 891.94] good gifts from God
[891.94 → 892.62] and invaluable
[892.62 → 893.66] in times of need
[893.66 → 894.54] our hope
[894.54 → 895.72] isn't in prime ministers
[895.72 → 896.58] or premiers
[896.58 → 897.24] or kings
[897.24 → 897.80] or queens
[897.80 → 899.02] or tech billionaires
[899.02 → 900.48] bent on getting to Mars
[900.48 → 901.80] though we want them
[901.80 → 902.36] to succeed
[902.36 → 903.72] and we will pray for them
[903.72 → 905.04] and for their prosperity
[905.04 → 905.82] and the prosperity
[905.82 → 906.52] of our cities
[906.52 → 907.60] and our countries
[907.60 → 909.08] but our hope
[909.08 → 909.92] is something else
[909.92 → 911.26] and if you're with me
[911.26 → 911.98] in this
[911.98 → 912.58] and you're tracking
[912.58 → 913.34] this morning
[913.34 → 913.98] your heart
[913.98 → 915.42] is starting to tingle
[915.42 → 916.88] because our hope
[916.88 → 918.74] is in a sun
[918.74 → 921.34] for to us
[921.34 → 922.60] a child
[922.60 → 923.62] is born
[923.62 → 925.76] to us
[925.76 → 927.32] a son
[927.32 → 928.66] is given
[928.66 → 931.10] don't miss it
[931.10 → 932.16] don't let
[932.16 → 932.94] the familiarity
[932.94 → 934.28] of this text
[934.28 → 935.24] and this sedum
[935.24 → 936.52] breed boredom
[936.52 → 937.48] a child
[937.48 → 938.16] is born
[938.16 → 938.72] a son
[938.72 → 939.56] is given
[939.56 → 940.44] and the son
[940.44 → 941.64] that the son
[941.64 → 942.14] is given
[942.14 → 943.10] is one of the most
[943.10 → 944.50] important articles
[944.50 → 945.72] of the Christian faith
[945.72 → 946.56] right
[946.56 → 947.14] we know
[947.14 → 948.06] that this child
[948.06 → 948.48] born
[948.48 → 949.06] this son
[949.06 → 949.38] given
[949.38 → 950.38] is Jesus
[950.38 → 951.14] Jesus
[951.14 → 952.30] who was born
[952.30 → 953.22] to be our
[953.22 → 954.02] substitute
[954.02 → 954.82] in obedience
[954.82 → 956.16] and a substitute
[956.16 → 956.72] in bearing
[956.72 → 957.38] the punishment
[957.38 → 958.36] for our sin
[958.36 → 959.46] that's what it means
[959.46 → 960.40] that he is a son
[960.40 → 961.10] given
[961.10 → 961.38] right
[961.38 → 962.04] he's given
[962.04 → 962.70] for you
[962.70 → 963.32] he's given
[963.32 → 964.18] to bear
[964.18 → 964.76] your death
[964.76 → 965.30] he's given
[965.30 → 966.24] in order to give
[966.24 → 967.08] you his
[967.08 → 968.00] righteousness
[968.00 → 970.36] he is our
[970.36 → 971.04] substitute
[971.04 → 972.16] who imputes
[972.16 → 973.10] his perfect
[973.10 → 974.04] obedience
[974.04 → 975.42] he gives us
[975.42 → 976.60] his righteousness
[976.60 → 977.58] as we give
[977.58 → 978.42] our sin
[978.42 → 978.92] to him
[978.92 → 979.54] our sin
[979.54 → 980.24] is imputed
[980.24 → 981.18] on him
[981.18 → 982.06] he who knew
[982.06 → 982.60] no sin
[982.60 → 983.48] became sin
[983.48 → 984.06] for us
[984.06 → 984.60] that we
[984.60 → 985.46] might become
[985.46 → 986.54] the righteousness
[986.54 → 987.78] of God
[987.78 → 989.50] that's hope
[989.50 → 991.44] that while we were
[991.44 → 992.16] yet sinners
[992.16 → 993.36] Christ came
[993.36 → 994.42] and died for us
[994.42 → 995.42] on the cross
[995.42 → 996.68] that's hope
[996.68 → 998.06] that I am not my own
[998.06 → 998.66] but belong
[998.66 → 999.60] body and soul
[999.60 → 1000.64] in life and in death
[1000.64 → 1001.84] to my faithful saviour
[1001.84 → 1003.00] Jesus Christ
[1003.00 → 1004.26] that's hope
[1004.26 → 1004.86] that Jesus
[1004.86 → 1005.84] lived the life
[1005.84 → 1006.70] I should have lived
[1006.70 → 1007.88] and died the death
[1007.88 → 1008.90] that I deserve
[1008.90 → 1009.88] that's hope
[1009.88 → 1010.54] that we have
[1010.54 → 1011.68] a wonderful counsellor
[1011.68 → 1012.80] mighty God
[1012.80 → 1014.24] everlasting father
[1014.24 → 1015.58] and prince of peace
[1015.58 → 1019.04] I've already quoted him
[1019.04 → 1019.40] once
[1019.40 → 1020.68] this morning
[1020.68 → 1021.56] but you'll forgive me
[1021.56 → 1022.72] because it's just so good
[1022.72 → 1023.50] John Calvin
[1023.50 → 1025.04] again on this point
[1025.04 → 1025.68] he says
[1025.68 → 1026.70] the son
[1026.70 → 1027.38] the son is called
[1027.38 → 1028.46] mighty God
[1028.46 → 1030.12] because our true
[1030.12 → 1031.48] contest is with
[1031.48 → 1032.10] the devil
[1032.10 → 1032.92] and death
[1032.92 → 1033.78] and sin
[1033.78 → 1035.48] enemies too powerful
[1035.48 → 1036.60] and strong
[1036.60 → 1037.80] by whom we would be
[1037.80 → 1039.34] immediately vanquished
[1039.34 → 1040.92] if the might of Christ
[1040.92 → 1041.92] had not rendered
[1041.92 → 1042.78] us
[1042.78 → 1044.16] invincible
[1044.16 → 1046.98] you are more
[1046.98 → 1048.06] than conquerors
[1048.06 → 1049.82] right for our struggle
[1049.82 → 1050.74] is not against flesh
[1050.74 → 1051.26] and blood
[1051.26 → 1052.62] but against the rulers
[1052.62 → 1053.62] and against the authorities
[1053.62 → 1055.26] against the powers
[1055.26 → 1056.46] of this dark world
[1056.46 → 1058.10] and against the spiritual forces
[1058.10 → 1058.84] of evil
[1058.84 → 1060.28] in the heavenly realms
[1060.28 → 1061.76] you are more
[1061.76 → 1062.80] than conquerors
[1062.80 → 1064.92] the life and death
[1064.92 → 1065.56] of Jesus
[1065.56 → 1066.96] his resurrection
[1066.96 → 1068.56] over death
[1068.56 → 1069.48] has secured
[1069.48 → 1071.42] the victory of God
[1071.42 → 1072.50] over sin
[1072.50 → 1073.18] and death
[1073.18 → 1073.86] and that same
[1073.86 → 1074.60] life, death
[1074.60 → 1075.26] and resurrection
[1075.26 → 1076.18] of Jesus
[1076.18 → 1077.78] secures in you
[1077.78 → 1078.74] that victory
[1078.74 → 1080.84] nothing can separate you
[1080.84 → 1081.94] from the love of God
[1081.94 → 1082.86] that is available
[1082.86 → 1084.38] in Christ Jesus
[1084.38 → 1086.24] that's our hope
[1086.24 → 1088.98] and all this
[1088.98 → 1090.72] from the words
[1090.72 → 1091.40] to us
[1091.40 → 1092.34] a son
[1092.34 → 1093.40] is given
[1093.40 → 1095.38] because you see
[1095.38 → 1095.82] given
[1095.82 → 1097.32] means gift
[1097.32 → 1099.26] the gospel
[1099.26 → 1100.02] is
[1100.02 → 1100.78] Jesus
[1100.78 → 1101.68] is your
[1101.68 → 1102.52] gift
[1102.52 → 1103.08] faith
[1103.08 → 1104.36] is your gift
[1104.36 → 1105.68] God's grace
[1105.68 → 1106.68] is your
[1106.68 → 1107.44] gift
[1107.44 → 1108.00] and it is
[1108.00 → 1109.10] freely given
[1109.10 → 1111.58] Christian hope
[1111.58 → 1112.56] doesn't belong
[1112.56 → 1113.98] to good people
[1113.98 → 1115.76] who have it all together
[1115.76 → 1117.18] holy people
[1117.18 → 1117.78] who are better
[1117.78 → 1118.56] than our neighbours
[1118.56 → 1120.38] Christian hope
[1120.38 → 1122.14] belongs to broken people
[1122.14 → 1124.10] people who need it
[1124.10 → 1126.10] our hope is ours
[1126.10 → 1127.32] because we know
[1127.32 → 1128.68] that we aren't good enough
[1128.68 → 1129.92] and that we need a saviour
[1129.92 → 1133.42] the son is a gift
[1133.42 → 1135.56] because I don't deserve him
[1135.56 → 1137.30] and yet he gave himself
[1137.30 → 1137.76] for me
[1137.76 → 1139.96] the truth
[1139.96 → 1141.02] of God's promise
[1141.02 → 1142.10] of redemption
[1142.10 → 1143.18] is not just
[1143.18 → 1143.92] in the realm
[1143.92 → 1144.54] of ideas
[1144.54 → 1145.74] and propositions
[1145.74 → 1146.56] right
[1146.56 → 1147.06] the truth
[1147.06 → 1147.88] of God's promise
[1147.88 → 1148.36] of redemption
[1148.36 → 1149.10] ultimately
[1149.10 → 1150.42] needs to be
[1150.42 → 1151.32] incarnated
[1151.32 → 1152.66] to us
[1152.66 → 1153.20] a child
[1153.20 → 1153.94] is born
[1153.94 → 1154.86] to us
[1154.86 → 1155.34] a son
[1155.34 → 1156.16] is given
[1156.16 → 1156.38] right
[1156.38 → 1157.62] there is a straight line
[1157.62 → 1158.70] between these words
[1158.70 → 1159.92] here in Isaiah 9
[1159.92 → 1160.56] and the words
[1160.56 → 1161.46] of John 1
[1161.46 → 1162.32] where we read
[1162.32 → 1163.52] the word became flesh
[1163.52 → 1164.42] and made his dwelling
[1164.42 → 1165.36] among us
[1165.36 → 1166.88] we have seen his glory
[1166.88 → 1167.94] the glory of the one
[1167.94 → 1168.30] and only
[1168.30 → 1169.62] who came from the father
[1169.62 → 1170.90] full of grace
[1170.90 → 1171.92] and truth
[1171.92 → 1172.34] right
[1172.34 → 1172.94] our hope
[1172.94 → 1174.28] isn't ether real
[1174.28 → 1175.58] it isn't intangible
[1175.58 → 1176.20] our hope
[1176.20 → 1177.16] is a person
[1177.16 → 1177.96] our hope
[1177.96 → 1179.32] is enfleshed
[1179.32 → 1180.62] you can touch him
[1180.62 → 1181.88] you can see him
[1181.88 → 1183.22] you can hold him
[1183.22 → 1186.98] and if you are a Christian
[1186.98 → 1189.60] hearing this message
[1189.60 → 1190.48] this morning
[1190.48 → 1194.32] you have that hope
[1194.32 → 1196.94] and if you are a Christian
[1196.94 → 1197.76] hearing this message
[1197.76 → 1198.22] this morning
[1198.22 → 1202.78] you are that hope
[1202.78 → 1206.62] you are sent out
[1206.62 → 1208.32] to incarnate
[1208.32 → 1209.32] God's promise
[1209.32 → 1210.66] of redemption
[1210.66 → 1211.98] you incarnate
[1211.98 → 1212.72] the hope
[1212.72 → 1213.34] of Jesus
[1213.34 → 1214.14] in a hopeless
[1214.14 → 1215.14] age
[1215.14 → 1215.66] right
[1215.66 → 1216.92] it is our purpose
[1216.92 → 1218.10] to be lights
[1218.10 → 1219.34] in this present
[1219.34 → 1220.02] darkness
[1220.02 → 1220.74] to shine
[1220.74 → 1221.70] like stars
[1221.70 → 1222.36] in the universe
[1222.36 → 1223.48] as we hold our
[1223.48 → 1224.66] the word of life
[1224.66 → 1225.94] you are hope
[1225.94 → 1226.78] in the world
[1226.78 → 1228.08] because through you
[1228.08 → 1228.70] the world
[1228.70 → 1229.52] sees
[1229.52 → 1230.66] Jesus
[1230.66 → 1233.84] that's who we are
[1233.84 → 1235.18] that's what hope
[1235.18 → 1236.04] does for us
[1236.04 → 1239.24] now I'll
[1239.24 → 1240.88] end it here
[1240.88 → 1242.40] with this last thing
[1242.40 → 1245.02] careful listeners
[1245.02 → 1246.04] this morning
[1246.04 → 1247.64] will have noticed
[1247.64 → 1248.22] by now
[1248.22 → 1249.24] that not once
[1249.24 → 1250.50] have I said
[1250.50 → 1251.32] that our hope
[1251.32 → 1252.16] as Christians
[1252.16 → 1253.50] is in leaving
[1253.50 → 1255.34] this world behind
[1255.34 → 1257.34] or flying away
[1257.34 → 1257.80] to heaven
[1257.80 → 1259.20] like the old song
[1259.20 → 1259.60] says
[1259.60 → 1260.36] right
[1260.36 → 1261.26] it would be really easy
[1261.26 → 1261.64] to say
[1261.64 → 1262.18] that our hope
[1262.18 → 1263.14] is in ignoring
[1263.14 → 1263.72] this world
[1263.72 → 1264.66] and in this life
[1264.66 → 1266.36] because there's
[1266.36 → 1266.68] something
[1266.68 → 1268.18] like heaven
[1268.18 → 1269.08] afterwards
[1269.08 → 1269.82] the problem
[1269.82 → 1270.70] with thinking
[1270.70 → 1271.28] like that
[1271.28 → 1272.18] is that God
[1272.18 → 1272.86] doesn't think
[1272.86 → 1273.38] like that
[1273.38 → 1274.28] God doesn't
[1274.28 → 1275.32] ignore this world
[1275.32 → 1276.20] or this life
[1276.20 → 1276.96] and so neither
[1276.96 → 1277.48] can we
[1277.48 → 1278.22] right
[1278.22 → 1278.74] our hope
[1278.74 → 1279.78] is so much
[1279.78 → 1280.26] bigger
[1280.26 → 1281.42] so much more
[1281.42 → 1282.40] than heaven
[1282.40 → 1283.54] after you die
[1283.54 → 1284.00] now
[1284.00 → 1285.74] don't hear
[1285.74 → 1286.38] what I'm not saying
[1286.38 → 1288.56] let me be really
[1288.56 → 1289.06] clear
[1289.06 → 1290.54] and let me slow
[1290.54 → 1291.28] right down
[1291.28 → 1292.04] so that we all
[1292.04 → 1293.04] get it
[1293.04 → 1294.46] Christians
[1294.46 → 1295.38] who die
[1295.38 → 1297.22] go to heaven
[1297.22 → 1297.86] to be
[1297.86 → 1299.08] with Jesus
[1299.08 → 1299.76] amen
[1299.76 → 1300.84] and amen
[1300.84 → 1301.12] right
[1301.12 → 1302.16] Jesus confirms
[1302.16 → 1303.10] that when he says
[1303.10 → 1303.60] to the thief
[1303.60 → 1304.24] on the cross
[1304.24 → 1305.68] today you will be
[1305.68 → 1306.16] with me
[1306.16 → 1307.04] in paradise
[1307.04 → 1307.66] Paul
[1307.66 → 1308.70] the apostle Paul
[1308.70 → 1309.52] affirms that
[1309.52 → 1310.04] when he says
[1310.04 → 1310.58] to die
[1310.58 → 1311.24] is gain
[1311.24 → 1311.92] to depart
[1311.92 → 1312.72] and be
[1312.72 → 1314.08] with Christ
[1314.08 → 1314.94] and I cling
[1314.94 → 1315.70] to that truth
[1315.70 → 1316.30] of the gospel
[1316.30 → 1316.88] for life
[1316.88 → 1317.62] and I cling
[1317.62 → 1318.42] to that truth
[1318.42 → 1319.06] of the gospel
[1319.06 → 1319.88] in the face
[1319.88 → 1320.48] of death
[1320.48 → 1321.36] but that
[1321.36 → 1322.06] hope
[1322.06 → 1323.32] is only true
[1323.32 → 1324.86] because of a greater hope
[1324.86 → 1327.08] that isn't just heaven
[1327.08 → 1328.18] but is a person
[1328.18 → 1329.48] a hope
[1329.48 → 1330.34] who is a person
[1330.34 → 1331.56] who is a king
[1331.56 → 1332.96] a king of whom
[1332.96 → 1333.72] the increase
[1333.72 → 1334.50] of his government
[1334.50 → 1335.30] and peace
[1335.30 → 1336.62] there will be no end
[1336.62 → 1337.38] he will reign
[1337.38 → 1338.62] on David's throne
[1338.62 → 1339.86] and over his kingdom
[1339.86 → 1340.54] establishing
[1340.54 → 1341.84] and upholding it
[1341.84 → 1342.44] with justice
[1342.44 → 1343.14] and righteousness
[1343.14 → 1344.52] from that time on
[1344.52 → 1345.72] and forever
[1345.72 → 1346.96] our hope
[1346.96 → 1347.92] is a king
[1347.92 → 1349.52] and his kingdom
[1349.52 → 1351.90] look
[1351.90 → 1353.78] check this out
[1353.78 → 1355.24] in the gospel
[1355.24 → 1355.76] of Mark
[1355.76 → 1358.30] Jesus' first words
[1358.30 → 1359.42] to the people
[1359.42 → 1360.06] when he begins
[1360.06 → 1361.10] his preaching ministry
[1361.10 → 1362.10] is
[1362.10 → 1363.92] the time has come
[1363.92 → 1365.06] the kingdom
[1365.06 → 1366.04] of God
[1366.04 → 1367.00] has come
[1367.00 → 1367.64] near
[1367.64 → 1369.36] right
[1369.36 → 1370.30] you hear it
[1370.30 → 1370.74] right
[1370.74 → 1372.06] Jesus has come
[1372.06 → 1373.30] and so the kingdom
[1373.30 → 1374.74] has come
[1374.74 → 1375.70] and yet
[1375.70 → 1377.74] and I love this
[1377.74 → 1378.06] right
[1378.06 → 1379.06] track with me
[1379.06 → 1379.88] Jesus
[1379.88 → 1380.94] when he teaches
[1380.94 → 1381.68] his disciples
[1381.68 → 1382.36] to pray
[1382.36 → 1383.64] what does he teach them
[1383.64 → 1384.44] right
[1384.44 → 1385.14] he says to pray
[1385.14 → 1385.88] like this
[1385.88 → 1387.48] our father in heaven
[1387.48 → 1388.74] hallowed be
[1388.74 → 1390.06] your name
[1390.06 → 1391.62] your
[1391.62 → 1392.84] kingdom
[1392.84 → 1394.02] come
[1394.02 → 1396.04] and so what is it
[1396.04 → 1398.42] has it already come
[1398.42 → 1399.92] or do we need to pray
[1399.92 → 1400.66] for its coming
[1400.66 → 1402.42] what's the answer
[1402.42 → 1404.36] it's both
[1404.36 → 1406.04] it is both
[1406.04 → 1406.70] it is
[1406.70 → 1407.78] our hope
[1407.78 → 1408.12] hope in
[1408.12 → 1409.10] a person
[1409.10 → 1410.06] and in
[1410.06 → 1410.56] a king
[1410.56 → 1411.18] whose kingdom
[1411.18 → 1412.02] has come
[1412.02 → 1413.14] and is
[1413.14 → 1413.90] coming
[1413.90 → 1414.84] right
[1414.84 → 1415.54] and in these
[1415.54 → 1417.00] in between times
[1417.00 → 1417.94] that we know
[1417.94 → 1418.54] that the devil
[1418.54 → 1419.34] has been defeated
[1419.34 → 1420.08] that sin
[1420.08 → 1420.58] and death
[1420.58 → 1421.36] have been overcome
[1421.36 → 1422.64] but we are waiting
[1422.64 → 1423.20] for them
[1423.20 → 1424.24] to be destroyed
[1424.24 → 1424.88] when the kingdom
[1424.88 → 1426.04] comes in its fullness
[1426.04 → 1427.98] this is advent
[1427.98 → 1430.50] this is our expectation
[1430.50 → 1432.32] and we also know
[1432.32 → 1434.00] that the death throes
[1434.00 → 1435.08] of a trapped animal
[1435.08 → 1436.72] are the most dangerous
[1436.72 → 1439.16] that's the time
[1439.16 → 1439.82] we live in
[1439.82 → 1442.40] now is exactly
[1442.40 → 1443.12] the time
[1443.12 → 1444.56] to be captivated
[1444.56 → 1445.44] by the hope
[1445.44 → 1446.38] of the gospel
[1446.38 → 1447.70] now is exactly
[1447.70 → 1448.28] the time
[1448.28 → 1449.32] to open the eyes
[1449.32 → 1449.84] of our heart
[1449.84 → 1450.48] to the kingdom
[1450.48 → 1451.54] come and the kingdom
[1451.54 → 1452.04] coming
[1452.04 → 1454.50] the apostle Peter
[1454.50 → 1456.10] writes to a group
[1456.10 → 1456.58] of Christians
[1456.58 → 1457.26] who are facing
[1457.26 → 1458.64] trial and hardship
[1458.64 → 1459.42] for their faith
[1459.42 → 1460.84] and he reminds them
[1460.84 → 1463.06] you have been born again
[1463.06 → 1465.18] to a living hope
[1465.18 → 1466.64] through the resurrection
[1466.64 → 1467.74] of Jesus
[1467.74 → 1468.86] from the dead
[1468.86 → 1471.16] your hope
[1471.16 → 1472.04] is fixed
[1472.04 → 1473.18] and sure
[1473.18 → 1474.26] because it is
[1474.26 → 1475.12] in a person
[1475.12 → 1476.00] a man
[1476.00 → 1477.10] named Jesus
[1477.10 → 1478.96] who is God
[1478.96 → 1480.18] your hope
[1480.18 → 1480.82] is guaranteed
[1480.82 → 1481.78] because the kingdom
[1481.78 → 1482.64] has come
[1482.64 → 1484.38] and is coming
[1484.38 → 1487.18] Jesus will make
[1487.18 → 1488.16] all things
[1488.16 → 1488.92] new
[1488.92 → 1491.02] that is
[1491.02 → 1491.66] hope's
[1491.66 → 1492.36] promise
[1492.36 → 1494.12] and with God
[1494.12 → 1495.84] it's a sure thing
[1495.84 → 1498.18] this Advent
[1498.18 → 1499.18] perhaps more than
[1499.18 → 1500.24] any other Advent
[1500.24 → 1501.30] in recent history
[1501.30 → 1502.64] we all need hope

[1510.62 → 1511.88] and conversations
[1511.88 → 1512.64] with hope

[1519.12 → 1519.68] reality
[1519.68 → 1520.52] isn't the end
[1520.52 → 1521.16] of the story

[1524.92 → 1525.86] based
[1525.86 → 1527.04] creatures
[1527.04 → 1528.40] and what we believe
[1528.40 → 1529.02] about the future
[1529.02 → 1530.38] directly controls
[1530.38 → 1532.02] how we experience

[1532.58 → 1534.16] I for one
