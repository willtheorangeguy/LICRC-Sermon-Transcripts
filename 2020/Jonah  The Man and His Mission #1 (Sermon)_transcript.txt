[0.00 --> 9.12]  I'm scheduled to come here a number of times in the next number of weeks and so I thought
[9.12 --> 15.70]  I would like to look at a narrative story in scripture that is a familiar one and that
[15.70 --> 16.92]  is the story of Jonah.
[17.52 --> 24.70]  And so over the next number of times when I'm here, I'm going to focus on each subsequent
[24.70 --> 26.54]  chapter of Jonah.
[26.54 --> 34.14]  It's not a very long book, I'm tempted almost to read the whole thing, but I'm only going
[34.14 --> 35.72]  to read chapter one this morning.
[36.34 --> 40.94]  But I'm going to invite you and those of you who are watching on live stream and who are
[40.94 --> 45.78]  part of Emanuel Church to spend some time looking at the book of Jonah.
[45.90 --> 48.88]  Don't just simply read the words.
[50.36 --> 51.40]  Two challenges.
[52.10 --> 55.94]  Take a look at its structure, how it is structured.
[55.94 --> 61.60]  You'll find that chapters one and two have a parallel in chapters three and four.
[62.36 --> 63.46]  And then here's the challenge.
[64.40 --> 69.28]  And I will reveal the answer at some point if I don't forget, but I don't think I will.
[69.48 --> 70.34]  But here's the challenge.
[70.48 --> 77.16]  See if you can find in your mind and in your heart and in your experience a parallel story
[77.16 --> 79.28]  out of the New Testament.
[79.28 --> 88.52]  Just see if you can find in your heart and your mind a parallel story out of the New Testament.
[89.16 --> 95.26]  The Hebrew writers of the Old Testament were very skilled.
[95.26 --> 98.80]  They were thoughtful.
[98.80 --> 103.74]  They were led by the Holy Spirit of God, but they were very skilled.
[104.26 --> 112.20]  And when you read the book of Jonah, you need to remember that Jonah, who we presume to be
[112.20 --> 117.42]  the author, was looking back at his experience.
[117.42 --> 121.02]  He wasn't writing about it as it was happening.
[121.84 --> 124.06]  He was looking back at it.
[124.20 --> 126.36]  It was history for him.
[127.30 --> 129.76]  And it becomes history for us.
[130.52 --> 134.30]  And we need to try to find ourselves in the story.
[134.80 --> 138.10]  So let me read from Jonah chapter one.
[138.10 --> 145.32]  The word of the Lord came to Jonah, the son of Amittai, go to the great city of Nineveh
[145.32 --> 150.86]  and preach against it because its wickedness has come up before me.
[151.84 --> 158.34]  But Jonah ran away from the Lord and headed for Tarshish.
[158.48 --> 162.04]  He went down to Joppa where he found a ship bound for that port.
[162.04 --> 168.10]  After paying the fare, he went aboard and sailed for Tarshish to flee from the Lord.
[169.54 --> 175.42]  Then the Lord sent a great wind on the sea and such a violent storm arose that the ship
[175.42 --> 176.62]  threatened to break up.
[178.50 --> 183.74]  All the sailors were afraid and each cried out to his own God.
[184.78 --> 189.46]  And they threw the cargo into the sea to begin to lighten the ship.
[189.46 --> 194.20]  But Jonah had gone below deck where he lay down and fell into a deep sleep.
[195.60 --> 199.14]  The captain went to him and said, how can you sleep?
[199.66 --> 201.66]  Get up and call on your God.
[202.82 --> 207.44]  Maybe he will take notice of us so that we will not perish.
[209.12 --> 215.50]  Then the sailors said to each other, come, let us cast lots to find out who is responsible
[215.50 --> 216.66]  for this calamity.
[216.66 --> 220.68]  They cast lots and the lot fell on Jonah.
[222.20 --> 227.04]  And so they asked him, tell us who is responsible for making all this trouble for us?
[227.54 --> 230.04]  What kind of work do you do?
[230.46 --> 231.52]  Where do you come from?
[232.08 --> 233.04]  What is your country?
[233.88 --> 235.46]  From what people are you?
[236.80 --> 238.18]  And he answered, I'm Hebrew.
[238.18 --> 244.64]  And I worship the Lord, the God of heaven who made the sea and the dry land.
[245.56 --> 246.90]  This terrified them.
[246.98 --> 249.32]  And they asked, what have you done?
[249.32 --> 256.28]  They knew he was running away from the Lord because he had already told them so.
[257.24 --> 260.84]  The sea was getting rougher and rougher.
[261.70 --> 266.40]  So they asked him, what should we do to you to make the sea calm down for us?
[267.46 --> 273.22]  Pick me up and throw me into the sea, he replied, and it will become calm.
[273.22 --> 279.04]  I know that it is my fault that this great storm has come upon you.
[279.88 --> 283.86]  Instead, the men did their best to roll back to the land.
[284.74 --> 289.98]  But they could not, for the sea was growing wilder than before.
[290.24 --> 296.72]  Then they cried out to the Lord, please, Lord, do not let us die for taking this man's life.
[296.72 --> 303.86]  Do not hold us accountable for killing an innocent man, for you, Lord, have done as you pleased.
[305.08 --> 310.22]  Then they took Jonah and threw him overboard, and the raging sea grew calm.
[311.34 --> 317.66]  At this, the men greatly feared the Lord, and they offered a sacrifice to the Lord and made vows to him.
[318.56 --> 325.92]  Now the Lord provided a huge fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days.
[326.72 --> 327.66]  And three nights.
[328.22 --> 329.68]  This is the word of the Lord.
[332.00 --> 335.24]  So what have you been doing over the last number of months?
[336.36 --> 339.08]  You've had time to do different things.
[339.72 --> 340.60]  School has been out.
[340.60 --> 349.70]  Perhaps if you have children at home, you had to do some homeschooling, and you discovered the challenging work of a teacher.
[349.70 --> 358.92]  Or perhaps you've had to work from home, and you've discovered the importance of keeping a routine.
[360.70 --> 372.06]  Or perhaps you have indulged ever more into social media, and you have become much more adept at finding your way around the internet.
[372.06 --> 377.78]  Or perhaps you have been reading more.
[378.78 --> 383.90]  The newspaper, magazines, books, fiction, and nonfiction.
[384.72 --> 389.20]  What have you been doing over the last three months?
[390.84 --> 391.56]  Complaining?
[393.18 --> 394.40]  Binge-watching?
[394.40 --> 394.90]  Binge-watching?
[395.30 --> 395.74]  Binge-watching?
[396.36 --> 398.98]  I've painted the interior of our house.
[400.72 --> 402.36]  Our marriage is still together.
[403.98 --> 411.22]  One of the things that happened is that this man died in the time.
[412.10 --> 414.72]  His name is Ravi Zacharias.
[415.54 --> 421.96]  Ravi Zacharias was born in India, converted to the Christian faith in his teenage years.
[421.96 --> 425.56]  he was about 17, he had attempted to commit suicide.
[427.26 --> 431.00]  And as a result of that attempt on his life,
[431.88 --> 436.66]  he was confronted by the reality of who Jesus was,
[437.66 --> 440.78]  and he committed his life to Christ
[440.78 --> 445.12]  by the sovereign grace of God, working in his heart.
[446.32 --> 451.16]  He moved to Canada, went to now what is Tyndale Seminary,
[451.96 --> 455.44]  became part of the Christian Missionary Alliance Church,
[456.18 --> 459.94]  and established a ministry of apologetics.
[459.94 --> 466.62]  That is, he went around to people to defend the Christian faith.
[468.14 --> 471.76]  He's been doing that for years and years, going to college campuses,
[471.76 --> 476.22]  and has a whole ministry that is now based in the state of Georgia.
[476.22 --> 482.28]  He was diagnosed with cancer earlier, or late last year, early this year,
[482.50 --> 486.20]  and died rather quickly in May of this past year.
[486.20 --> 493.88]  He had a blog and a radio program entitled,
[493.88 --> 498.00]  Let My People Think.
[498.00 --> 502.84]  Let My People Think.
[502.84 --> 510.38]  In other words, let my people grow deeper into the Christian faith,
[511.22 --> 514.82]  thinking about not only its doctrines,
[515.28 --> 517.52]  but also its practices.
[517.52 --> 524.86]  thinking about how we can best address the issues of the day.
[525.60 --> 531.76]  Thinking about how we can best walk in the footsteps of Jesus.
[531.76 --> 536.28]  In response to his death,
[536.28 --> 540.58]  I began to read one of his books once again,
[540.58 --> 545.80]  because I wanted to come to a deeper sense of appreciation
[545.80 --> 549.18]  for the impactful ministry he has had.
[549.24 --> 552.72]  And if you have had time now to explore the internet,
[552.92 --> 553.86]  you'll know about YouTube,
[554.14 --> 556.44]  and you just have to put his name onto YouTube,
[556.44 --> 561.06]  and you get all sorts of different videos and clips of his work.
[561.06 --> 565.16]  He is a very thoughtful, convicting speaker,
[565.82 --> 571.18]  and I think you would benefit from hearing what he has to say.
[571.24 --> 571.72]  But he said,
[572.24 --> 575.58]  Let my people think.
[577.12 --> 579.68]  And as I was reflecting on that,
[579.76 --> 584.96]  and reflecting upon the need to lay open God's word,
[584.96 --> 589.22]  I thought, maybe we should think a little bit more about Jonah.
[589.82 --> 592.00]  Now Jonah is a very popular topic, of course,
[592.50 --> 596.62]  because Sunday school classes can be built around him.
[597.38 --> 601.24]  Vacation Bible school themes can be built around what happened.
[601.38 --> 607.06]  I mean, kids just love this whole idea of storms and whales or great fishes
[607.06 --> 609.82]  and living inside of a fish for three days.
[609.92 --> 613.82]  I mean, you could make something dramatic of that.
[614.96 --> 617.54]  But you really want to ask,
[617.96 --> 621.60]  what do we know about Jonah,
[621.96 --> 626.56]  and do we really believe that Jonah existed?
[626.78 --> 628.62]  Because there's much debate about that.
[629.10 --> 633.58]  Who believes that a fish could be so big to swallow a man,
[633.68 --> 635.90]  to allow to live inside of the stomach,
[636.20 --> 637.94]  full of gastric acid?
[637.94 --> 642.68]  What would his skin have looked like three days later
[642.68 --> 645.94]  when he was ejected in a whole blast of protein?
[648.64 --> 649.36]  Really?
[649.76 --> 651.60]  Can you really believe that happened?
[653.30 --> 655.32]  Maybe it's not real.
[655.58 --> 658.38]  Maybe it's just a fictional story
[658.38 --> 661.34]  created out of a man's imagination
[661.34 --> 663.70]  to drive home a point.
[665.76 --> 667.70]  Maybe it's a parable,
[668.82 --> 671.48]  a fantastical story
[671.48 --> 674.78]  to make us think.
[676.68 --> 678.32]  What do you know about Jonah?
[679.34 --> 681.54]  Well, Jonah is mentioned
[681.54 --> 684.48]  not only in the book that bears his name,
[684.48 --> 687.56]  but also in 2 Kings chapter 14.
[687.78 --> 688.66]  He was the one.
[689.16 --> 690.66]  This is Jeroboam II,
[690.86 --> 692.68]  who was the king
[692.68 --> 694.06]  in the northern part of Israel.
[694.34 --> 696.36]  The land had divided,
[696.56 --> 698.00]  so there was Judah to the south
[698.00 --> 699.96]  and Israel to the north.
[700.18 --> 701.78]  And Jeroboam II,
[702.46 --> 703.68]  not the first king,
[703.78 --> 705.32]  but the second Jeroboam,
[705.74 --> 706.60]  was king,
[706.60 --> 711.66]  and his reign ended in 753 B.C.
[712.54 --> 714.16]  So he was the one
[714.16 --> 716.60]  who restored the boundaries of Israel
[716.60 --> 718.98]  from Labohamath to the Dead Sea
[718.98 --> 720.94]  in accordance with the word of the Lord,
[721.34 --> 722.30]  the God of Israel,
[722.48 --> 724.60]  spoken through his servant Jonah,
[725.12 --> 726.40]  son of Amittai,
[726.56 --> 728.52]  the prophet from Gath-Hippar.
[729.96 --> 732.62]  So Jonah's mentioned in the scriptures
[732.62 --> 734.48]  in another place.
[734.48 --> 737.14]  It puts us, then makes us aware
[737.14 --> 739.02]  of his time frame.
[740.64 --> 741.82]  And he was a prophet
[741.82 --> 743.48]  who spoke words of encouragement
[744.02 --> 745.52]  to Jeroboam II,
[746.24 --> 747.60]  who, however,
[748.06 --> 749.50]  was one who was described
[749.50 --> 750.72]  he did what was evil
[750.72 --> 751.98]  in the eyes of the Lord.
[752.46 --> 755.52]  And yet the Lord blessed his work and reign,
[755.88 --> 759.98]  and he was allowed to expand Israel
[759.98 --> 761.38]  to its former borders,
[761.58 --> 762.34]  to the north,
[762.34 --> 765.18]  to the land that was controlled
[765.18 --> 766.36]  by the people
[766.36 --> 768.00]  or the kingdom of Damascus.
[768.00 --> 771.18]  That had been part of David's reign
[771.18 --> 771.84]  and kingdom,
[772.20 --> 773.34]  and Jeroboam II
[773.34 --> 775.82]  pushed the boundaries back
[775.82 --> 777.54]  to the north.
[778.00 --> 779.48]  So his boundaries
[779.48 --> 780.82]  butted up against
[780.82 --> 781.58]  the boundaries
[781.58 --> 783.78]  of what would be called in time
[783.78 --> 785.34]  the Assyrian kingdom.
[785.34 --> 788.76]  And the Assyrian kingdom
[788.76 --> 792.74]  became a fairly large one,
[792.88 --> 795.68]  and you will see Nineveh,
[795.80 --> 797.14]  you see the letters,
[797.30 --> 797.96]  the Assyrian kingdom,
[798.10 --> 799.02]  and right above that,
[799.14 --> 800.84]  you'll see it's a little unclear,
[801.50 --> 804.54]  but that's where the city of Nineveh was.
[804.54 --> 807.10]  So the Assyrian kingdom
[807.10 --> 808.60]  was coming up
[808.60 --> 809.60]  in influence
[809.60 --> 810.82]  and power
[810.82 --> 812.54]  at the time of
[812.54 --> 813.36]  Jonah.
[814.32 --> 815.56]  It was recognized
[815.56 --> 817.80]  as a formidable
[817.80 --> 819.00]  opponent.
[820.50 --> 821.52]  In time,
[821.72 --> 823.60]  in 721 BC,
[824.52 --> 826.26]  the Assyrian empire
[826.26 --> 827.64]  would destroy
[827.64 --> 828.98]  the northern part
[828.98 --> 830.88]  of the land of Israel
[830.88 --> 833.40]  and take the northern Israelites
[833.40 --> 834.64]  into captivity
[834.64 --> 837.36]  from which they never recovered.
[839.18 --> 840.70]  So Jonah was
[840.70 --> 841.90]  aware
[841.90 --> 843.88]  of the Assyrians
[843.88 --> 845.04]  and
[845.04 --> 847.14]  of their growing impact
[847.14 --> 847.88]  and power.
[848.78 --> 849.96]  This is a picture
[849.96 --> 851.12]  of the reconstruction
[851.12 --> 852.72]  of one of the gates
[852.72 --> 855.48]  of the city of Nineveh,
[855.90 --> 857.00]  and then beside
[857.00 --> 858.06]  that
[858.06 --> 858.48]  is
[858.48 --> 859.90]  words from
[859.90 --> 860.80]  the prophet
[860.80 --> 861.56]  Nahum.
[862.72 --> 863.62]  He comes about
[863.62 --> 864.78]  a hundred years later
[864.78 --> 866.54]  than Jonah,
[866.88 --> 868.24]  and Nahum writes,
[868.44 --> 869.54]  woe to the city
[869.54 --> 870.56]  of blood,
[870.68 --> 871.48]  full of lies,
[871.60 --> 872.36]  full of plunder,
[872.52 --> 873.62]  never without victims.
[873.72 --> 874.54]  That's verse 1.
[875.12 --> 876.30]  And then verse 19,
[876.82 --> 878.68]  nothing can heal you,
[879.12 --> 880.62]  your wound is fatal,
[881.18 --> 882.60]  all who hear the news
[882.60 --> 884.04]  about you clap their hands
[884.04 --> 884.84]  at your fall,
[885.40 --> 887.02]  for who has not felt
[887.02 --> 888.54]  your endless cruelty.
[890.24 --> 890.98]  Those are the words
[890.98 --> 891.62]  of Nahum
[891.62 --> 892.82]  to Nineveh,
[892.98 --> 894.58]  to the Assyrian Empire,
[894.74 --> 896.16]  a hundred years or so
[896.16 --> 897.74]  after Jonah,
[898.68 --> 900.50]  reflecting on the history
[900.50 --> 901.70]  and the conduct
[901.70 --> 903.18]  of the Assyrians.
[903.84 --> 904.96]  They were known
[904.96 --> 905.90]  for their cruelty.
[906.60 --> 907.52]  They were known
[907.52 --> 909.12]  for their attitude
[909.12 --> 910.90]  towards their enemy,
[911.42 --> 912.68]  to destroy them,
[912.68 --> 914.08]  to beat them down,
[914.24 --> 915.22]  to celebrate
[915.22 --> 917.18]  their defeat.
[918.58 --> 919.96]  So here we are.
[921.18 --> 922.12]  We have Jonah,
[922.70 --> 923.34]  a prophet
[923.34 --> 924.74]  in the northern part
[924.74 --> 925.84]  of Israel,
[926.54 --> 927.86]  encouraging the king
[927.86 --> 929.62]  who has been successful,
[930.30 --> 931.68]  who is very aware
[931.68 --> 933.56]  that to the further north
[933.56 --> 935.28]  and to the east
[935.28 --> 938.20]  arises this empire,
[938.20 --> 940.04]  which in time
[940.04 --> 941.62]  will have very
[941.62 --> 943.44]  destructive impact
[943.44 --> 944.78]  on the people
[944.78 --> 945.64]  of Israel.
[946.96 --> 948.54]  And God says
[948.54 --> 949.50]  to Jonah,
[950.06 --> 952.70]  go to Nineveh,
[953.02 --> 954.28]  that great city,
[954.94 --> 956.18]  and preach
[956.18 --> 957.58]  against it.
[959.18 --> 960.32]  And Jonah says,
[960.40 --> 960.60]  no.
[962.28 --> 963.00]  I ain't going.
[964.76 --> 966.20]  Alexander Maslow
[966.20 --> 968.38]  was quoted by John Ortberg,
[968.74 --> 971.06]  and Maslow gets credit
[971.06 --> 973.38]  for writing a summary
[973.38 --> 976.36]  in the words of Dr. Seuss.
[977.82 --> 979.20]  I would not go there
[979.20 --> 979.68]  in a boat.
[980.16 --> 981.22]  I would not go there
[981.22 --> 981.74]  in a float.
[982.16 --> 983.26]  I would not go there
[983.26 --> 983.84]  in a gale.
[984.02 --> 985.12]  I would not go there
[985.12 --> 985.68]  in a whale.
[986.12 --> 987.96]  I do not like the people there.
[988.50 --> 989.70]  If they'd all died,
[989.78 --> 990.82]  I would not care.
[991.68 --> 992.62]  I will not go
[992.62 --> 993.72]  to that great town.
[994.14 --> 995.30]  I'd rather choke.
[995.30 --> 996.88]  I'd rather drown.
[997.56 --> 998.34]  I will not go
[998.34 --> 999.36]  by land or sea.
[1000.06 --> 1001.52]  So stop the talk
[1001.52 --> 1003.02]  and let me be.
[1005.70 --> 1006.34]  Jonah says,
[1006.42 --> 1006.64]  no.
[1009.46 --> 1010.68]  Imagine for a moment
[1010.68 --> 1012.68]  that you were a rabbi,
[1012.90 --> 1014.02]  a Jewish rabbi,
[1014.64 --> 1015.92]  in 1941,
[1016.92 --> 1019.02]  and that you lived
[1019.02 --> 1020.42]  in greater Europe,
[1020.42 --> 1022.96]  and God came to you
[1022.96 --> 1023.36]  and said,
[1023.50 --> 1024.86]  go to Berlin
[1024.86 --> 1028.28]  and preach against it.
[1030.80 --> 1032.00]  Would you go?
[1032.00 --> 1036.48]  By that time,
[1037.02 --> 1038.68]  the war had started.
[1039.98 --> 1041.04]  Concentration camps
[1041.04 --> 1041.70]  were packed.
[1042.98 --> 1043.66]  Jews were being
[1043.66 --> 1045.32]  transported en masse.
[1046.98 --> 1048.74]  Millions would die.
[1050.34 --> 1051.10]  Would you go?
[1052.44 --> 1053.88]  Would it make any sense?
[1053.88 --> 1060.26]  Let my people think.
[1060.26 --> 1063.02]  Let my people think.
[1064.68 --> 1066.02]  And so Jonah says,
[1066.14 --> 1066.32]  no.
[1067.62 --> 1068.88]  And Jonah decides
[1068.88 --> 1070.56]  that he's going to run.
[1071.50 --> 1072.98]  So he goes from his home
[1072.98 --> 1074.06]  down to Joppa,
[1074.38 --> 1075.84]  and he gets on a ship
[1075.84 --> 1076.26]  to Tarshish.
[1076.26 --> 1076.78]  Tarshish.
[1077.04 --> 1077.26]  Now,
[1077.74 --> 1078.98]  notice something,
[1079.56 --> 1080.72]  because you have to
[1080.72 --> 1081.50]  slow down
[1081.50 --> 1082.76]  when you read Scripture,
[1083.04 --> 1084.72]  because every word
[1084.72 --> 1086.40]  and every sentence,
[1086.56 --> 1087.56]  every phrase
[1087.56 --> 1088.86]  can be packed
[1088.86 --> 1089.60]  with meaning
[1089.60 --> 1090.74]  once you begin
[1090.74 --> 1091.90]  to unravel it
[1091.90 --> 1092.66]  a little bit.
[1094.44 --> 1095.72]  Notice that Jonah
[1095.72 --> 1098.00]  paid his own fare.
[1100.78 --> 1102.32]  He paid for a ticket,
[1103.00 --> 1105.02]  which was very unusual
[1105.02 --> 1105.98]  in the day.
[1105.98 --> 1107.40]  if you would travel
[1107.40 --> 1108.02]  by ship,
[1108.10 --> 1108.70]  because they were
[1108.70 --> 1109.88]  all cargo ships
[1109.88 --> 1111.36]  or military ships.
[1111.52 --> 1113.00]  There weren't cruise liners
[1113.00 --> 1114.42]  and passenger ships.
[1115.08 --> 1116.50]  No, you could buy a bed
[1116.50 --> 1117.32]  and then get from
[1117.32 --> 1118.36]  point A to B.
[1118.94 --> 1119.92]  No, you would go
[1119.92 --> 1120.54]  on a ship
[1120.54 --> 1121.62]  and you would barter.
[1121.74 --> 1122.82]  I'll sweep the deck.
[1123.54 --> 1124.82]  I'll cook the food.
[1125.24 --> 1126.32]  I'll help you load
[1126.32 --> 1127.12]  and unload
[1127.12 --> 1131.80]  in exchange for a trip,
[1132.00 --> 1133.40]  because I'm at A
[1133.40 --> 1134.68]  and I need to get to B
[1134.68 --> 1135.46]  and I know you're
[1135.46 --> 1136.08]  getting to be,
[1136.16 --> 1137.16]  you're going to be.
[1138.68 --> 1139.68]  But Jonah doesn't barter.
[1141.24 --> 1142.28]  Jonah pays the fare.
[1143.60 --> 1145.86]  He is a man of means.
[1146.30 --> 1149.02]  He is a person of influence.
[1150.28 --> 1152.82]  He can direct his own life.
[1152.82 --> 1155.22]  And he says,
[1155.42 --> 1157.20]  I will not go there in a boat.
[1157.32 --> 1159.28]  I will not go there in a float.
[1160.52 --> 1161.76]  Let them all die.
[1161.88 --> 1163.10]  I do not care.
[1164.70 --> 1166.20]  And so he goes his own way.
[1166.60 --> 1167.94]  Instead of going to Nineveh,
[1168.04 --> 1169.34]  he goes to Tarshish.
[1170.26 --> 1171.74]  And we think that Tarshish
[1171.74 --> 1173.74]  is probably located roughly now
[1173.74 --> 1176.74]  where the Gibraltar is located
[1176.74 --> 1178.02]  in Spain.
[1178.42 --> 1180.10]  For that time,
[1181.12 --> 1182.22]  it would be seen
[1182.22 --> 1182.84]  and known
[1182.84 --> 1184.28]  as the end of the world.
[1185.24 --> 1187.34]  As far as he could go,
[1188.12 --> 1190.46]  Jonah would go.
[1193.52 --> 1194.56]  And then,
[1195.56 --> 1197.26]  God sends a storm.
[1200.52 --> 1201.98]  Jonah has sinned.
[1201.98 --> 1205.28]  He has refused to obey God.
[1206.46 --> 1210.08]  And sin always has its consequences.
[1211.34 --> 1212.52]  You lie.
[1212.68 --> 1213.26]  You cheat.
[1214.14 --> 1215.74]  You practice injustice.
[1216.64 --> 1218.56]  We live in a moral universe.
[1219.84 --> 1222.74]  And sin always has its consequence.
[1223.86 --> 1225.88]  Sin puts you in a prison.
[1226.96 --> 1228.60]  Sin eats you up
[1228.60 --> 1231.54]  from the inside to the outside.
[1231.98 --> 1233.66]  I don't recall the name
[1233.66 --> 1234.60]  of the movie right now,
[1234.70 --> 1236.26]  but I watched a movie
[1236.26 --> 1237.44]  about Mr. Rogers.
[1237.60 --> 1238.70]  Do you remember Mr. Rogers?
[1238.80 --> 1239.44]  He was nominated
[1239.44 --> 1240.70]  for an Academy Award
[1240.70 --> 1242.66]  with Tom Hanks.
[1244.52 --> 1246.26]  And Mr. Rogers meets
[1246.26 --> 1247.48]  a guy named Lloyd.
[1247.92 --> 1250.30]  And Lloyd hates his father.
[1251.36 --> 1252.88]  And it's eating him up
[1252.88 --> 1254.36]  on the inside.
[1255.78 --> 1257.24]  If you want to watch a good movie,
[1257.32 --> 1258.74]  let me recommend that one to you.
[1259.26 --> 1259.52]  All right?
[1259.52 --> 1262.20]  Because it's a story
[1262.20 --> 1263.66]  about overcoming.
[1264.14 --> 1264.82]  Mr. Rogers,
[1265.00 --> 1266.52]  as some of you probably know,
[1266.94 --> 1268.44]  was a Presbyterian pastor
[1268.44 --> 1269.54]  for over 30 years.
[1269.74 --> 1270.58]  But he focused
[1270.58 --> 1271.66]  on children's ministry.
[1271.80 --> 1272.80]  He didn't talk overtly
[1272.80 --> 1273.96]  about Jesus so much,
[1274.04 --> 1276.20]  but he wanted to help children
[1276.20 --> 1279.46]  deal with their feelings
[1279.46 --> 1280.82]  and their fears
[1280.82 --> 1282.36]  and their experiences.
[1283.00 --> 1284.26]  There's a line in that movie
[1284.26 --> 1286.56]  that continues to sort of
[1286.56 --> 1287.94]  grab my attention.
[1288.14 --> 1288.44]  He says,
[1288.60 --> 1288.98]  Death,
[1289.36 --> 1292.30]  death is often not talked about.
[1293.66 --> 1296.78]  But if we mention death,
[1298.22 --> 1300.42]  then by mentioning it,
[1300.94 --> 1302.72]  it becomes manageable.
[1302.72 --> 1307.88]  And, you know,
[1307.92 --> 1309.36]  he deals with this person,
[1309.58 --> 1309.90]  Lloyd,
[1310.06 --> 1313.66]  whose life is being torn apart
[1313.66 --> 1315.60]  by his anger
[1315.60 --> 1317.38]  and by his pain,
[1317.58 --> 1319.10]  by his sin,
[1319.18 --> 1320.24]  as well as the sin
[1320.24 --> 1321.36]  of his father.
[1321.52 --> 1323.50]  It's a complicated story
[1323.50 --> 1326.00]  and yet a universal story.
[1326.00 --> 1329.16]  And the reality is
[1329.16 --> 1330.74]  that's what sin does.
[1332.18 --> 1333.96]  Sin eats away
[1333.96 --> 1335.24]  and breaks
[1335.24 --> 1337.06]  and tears
[1337.06 --> 1337.92]  and destroys.
[1338.74 --> 1339.98]  God sends a storm.
[1342.56 --> 1343.74]  And the storm grows great.
[1343.86 --> 1344.76]  Now these sailors
[1344.76 --> 1346.28]  are experienced people,
[1347.22 --> 1348.88]  but they notice
[1348.88 --> 1349.84]  that this storm
[1349.84 --> 1351.36]  seems to be extraordinary.
[1352.82 --> 1354.38]  And they begin to wonder
[1354.38 --> 1355.66]  who is the cause?
[1355.66 --> 1356.70]  What is the cause?
[1356.98 --> 1358.00]  This isn't natural.
[1358.20 --> 1360.10]  This isn't the way
[1360.10 --> 1361.64]  we have experienced it
[1361.64 --> 1362.90]  in the past.
[1366.48 --> 1367.96]  And then they cast a lot.
[1369.46 --> 1370.58]  And think about
[1370.58 --> 1371.70]  what they asked Jonah.
[1373.28 --> 1374.32]  Who are you?
[1376.20 --> 1377.34]  What do you do?
[1378.92 --> 1380.44]  Where do you come from?
[1382.44 --> 1384.04]  Who do you serve?
[1384.04 --> 1386.58]  Those are questions
[1386.58 --> 1387.72]  of identity.
[1388.24 --> 1389.28]  Remember the story.
[1389.40 --> 1390.60]  This is not the parallel story
[1390.60 --> 1391.08]  I'm looking,
[1391.38 --> 1392.40]  having you look for
[1392.40 --> 1393.70]  for the story of Jonah.
[1393.78 --> 1394.58]  But remember the story
[1394.58 --> 1395.12]  of Jesus
[1395.12 --> 1396.50]  as recorded in
[1396.50 --> 1397.94]  Mark chapter 4.
[1398.02 --> 1398.90]  He falls asleep
[1398.90 --> 1399.42]  in a boat
[1399.42 --> 1400.76]  and the storm comes
[1400.76 --> 1401.78]  and the disciples
[1401.78 --> 1402.44]  wake him
[1402.44 --> 1403.76]  and they say,
[1403.84 --> 1404.58]  aren't you afraid?
[1404.78 --> 1405.56]  And he gets up
[1405.56 --> 1406.10]  and he says,
[1406.80 --> 1408.38]  peace be still.
[1408.38 --> 1412.16]  And the wind abates
[1412.16 --> 1413.98]  and the storm abates
[1413.98 --> 1415.76]  and the apostles
[1415.76 --> 1416.48]  look at him
[1416.48 --> 1417.72]  and ask this question.
[1418.20 --> 1421.16]  Who then is this
[1421.16 --> 1422.76]  that even the winds
[1422.76 --> 1423.54]  and the waves
[1423.54 --> 1424.52]  obey him?
[1425.36 --> 1426.18]  Jonah's asked
[1426.18 --> 1427.26]  an identity question.
[1427.34 --> 1427.86]  Who are you?
[1427.92 --> 1428.68]  Where are you from?
[1428.96 --> 1429.88]  What are you doing?
[1429.96 --> 1430.72]  What's your purpose?
[1430.84 --> 1431.60]  What's your place?
[1431.70 --> 1432.68]  Who are your people?
[1432.68 --> 1435.26]  I am a Hebrew
[1435.26 --> 1437.94]  and I serve the God
[1437.94 --> 1441.12]  who created the land
[1441.12 --> 1442.60]  and the sea
[1442.60 --> 1447.02]  and they are deathly afraid.
[1450.06 --> 1451.78]  They are deathly afraid
[1451.78 --> 1454.24]  because the great God
[1454.24 --> 1454.96]  is the God
[1454.96 --> 1457.28]  who created the land
[1457.28 --> 1458.26]  and the sea
[1458.26 --> 1460.62]  and they are feeling vulnerable.
[1462.68 --> 1463.92]  And they do everything
[1463.92 --> 1464.76]  that they can.
[1465.90 --> 1468.02]  They throw the cargo overboard.
[1468.78 --> 1469.76]  Now stop to think
[1469.76 --> 1470.74]  what that means a minute.
[1471.84 --> 1473.78]  They're throwing their product,
[1473.96 --> 1475.34]  their wages overboard.
[1475.50 --> 1476.14]  They're throwing
[1476.14 --> 1478.02]  their future overboard.
[1478.68 --> 1479.86]  This is not just simply
[1479.86 --> 1481.12]  a matter of lightening
[1481.12 --> 1482.58]  their ship.
[1482.68 --> 1484.92]  This is a matter of surviving
[1484.92 --> 1486.02]  and then entering
[1486.02 --> 1487.66]  into abject poverty.
[1488.64 --> 1489.52]  There's no insurance
[1489.52 --> 1490.32]  at that point.
[1490.32 --> 1493.06]  They are putting themselves
[1493.06 --> 1494.42]  at great risk.
[1496.10 --> 1496.86]  And the captain,
[1497.12 --> 1499.70]  he marshals all the resources
[1499.70 --> 1500.98]  that he can,
[1501.84 --> 1502.90]  directing his sailors
[1502.90 --> 1504.18]  but then looking
[1504.18 --> 1506.24]  for this other passenger
[1506.24 --> 1508.40]  who is sleeping
[1508.40 --> 1510.14]  below deck.
[1510.86 --> 1512.10]  See, this is the ship
[1512.10 --> 1512.84]  of Tarshish.
[1513.52 --> 1514.50]  If you read the stories
[1514.50 --> 1515.06]  of Solomon,
[1515.20 --> 1516.04]  he had a whole fleet
[1516.04 --> 1516.72]  of these ships.
[1517.46 --> 1519.04]  These were not small boats.
[1519.04 --> 1521.90]  This was a ship
[1521.90 --> 1523.34]  that had multiple decks.
[1523.50 --> 1524.18]  It could be driven
[1524.18 --> 1526.06]  by ore and by wind.
[1526.76 --> 1528.70]  And they had all sorts
[1528.70 --> 1529.76]  of cargo that delivered
[1529.76 --> 1530.84]  here or there.
[1531.20 --> 1532.50]  And Jonah was below deck.
[1533.50 --> 1534.62]  And he was sleeping.
[1535.00 --> 1536.00]  And the captain comes
[1536.00 --> 1536.38]  and says,
[1536.74 --> 1536.94]  you know,
[1536.98 --> 1537.74]  wake up!
[1538.64 --> 1540.76]  The captain berates him.
[1542.50 --> 1544.08]  Pray to your God.
[1544.08 --> 1544.14]  God.
[1545.14 --> 1545.88]  We've got to have
[1545.88 --> 1547.22]  everything going
[1547.22 --> 1549.30]  going for us.
[1550.12 --> 1552.12]  That is how scary it is.
[1552.60 --> 1554.26]  And recognize this thing
[1554.26 --> 1556.40]  that you hear so often today
[1556.40 --> 1558.16]  in the context of COVID-19.
[1558.42 --> 1561.04]  We're all in this together.
[1561.72 --> 1564.80]  We all are on the same boat.
[1564.80 --> 1568.66]  So mobilize your resources.
[1570.18 --> 1571.28]  Do what is right.
[1572.76 --> 1574.06]  And here's one of the lessons,
[1574.24 --> 1574.62]  I think,
[1574.92 --> 1576.08]  that we need to learn
[1576.08 --> 1577.22]  from the story
[1577.22 --> 1579.20]  that is recorded in Jonah.
[1580.48 --> 1581.52]  The pagans
[1581.52 --> 1583.44]  come off
[1583.44 --> 1585.14]  more favorably
[1585.14 --> 1586.92]  than the prophet
[1586.92 --> 1588.12]  of God.
[1590.22 --> 1591.68]  The pagans
[1591.68 --> 1593.78]  do everything right.
[1595.96 --> 1596.92]  And therefore,
[1597.32 --> 1598.14]  as Christians,
[1598.36 --> 1599.18]  we need to learn
[1599.18 --> 1599.78]  a lesson
[1599.78 --> 1600.62]  and that is
[1600.62 --> 1601.86]  that we respect
[1601.86 --> 1603.16]  everyone
[1603.16 --> 1604.30]  regardless
[1604.30 --> 1605.62]  of their beliefs.
[1608.16 --> 1609.52]  And we treat them
[1609.52 --> 1610.38]  as we would like
[1610.38 --> 1611.06]  to be treated,
[1611.42 --> 1612.06]  respectfully.
[1614.46 --> 1615.44]  The pagans
[1615.44 --> 1616.20]  do what is right.
[1616.32 --> 1617.34]  They say to Jonah,
[1617.52 --> 1618.66]  what should we do?
[1618.76 --> 1619.38]  Jonah says,
[1619.48 --> 1620.66]  toss me overboard.
[1620.66 --> 1621.68]  And they said,
[1621.78 --> 1622.94]  we can't do that.
[1624.30 --> 1625.36]  And so rather
[1625.36 --> 1626.68]  than toss them overboard,
[1626.90 --> 1628.10]  they dig
[1628.10 --> 1630.22]  really hard
[1630.22 --> 1631.04]  into the water.
[1631.12 --> 1632.08]  The Hebrew word
[1632.08 --> 1632.62]  actually
[1632.62 --> 1633.64]  for their rowing
[1633.64 --> 1634.90]  is that they're digging.
[1635.28 --> 1636.00]  They are putting
[1636.00 --> 1637.10]  every effort
[1637.10 --> 1639.36]  into getting to shore.
[1640.06 --> 1641.42]  But they can't.
[1642.12 --> 1642.80]  So tell us,
[1642.86 --> 1643.18]  they say,
[1643.24 --> 1644.06]  who is responsible
[1644.06 --> 1645.20]  for making this trouble
[1645.20 --> 1645.76]  for us?
[1646.10 --> 1646.94]  What kind of work do you do?
[1647.24 --> 1648.08]  Where do you come from?
[1648.32 --> 1649.06]  What is your country?
[1649.42 --> 1650.44]  From what people are you?
[1650.44 --> 1651.66]  I am a Hebrew.
[1653.00 --> 1654.28]  And the ship gets flooded.
[1656.36 --> 1657.86]  And they toss them overboard.
[1660.28 --> 1661.44]  And it's like a flip
[1661.44 --> 1663.02]  of a switch.
[1664.72 --> 1667.16]  And it's quiet.
[1667.16 --> 1672.42]  And notice the response
[1672.42 --> 1673.74]  of the pagan sailors.
[1675.22 --> 1677.08]  They are afraid.
[1679.88 --> 1680.90]  They have prayed.
[1680.90 --> 1681.26]  Lord,
[1681.80 --> 1683.90]  do not hold the sin against us
[1683.90 --> 1685.82]  of throwing this guy overboard.
[1686.18 --> 1688.24]  But they are afraid.
[1690.08 --> 1691.60]  And they bring sacrifices.
[1691.60 --> 1693.44]  Now the important point here,
[1693.82 --> 1694.38]  I think,
[1694.44 --> 1695.98]  is often lost on us
[1695.98 --> 1697.60]  out of our own experience.
[1697.94 --> 1700.28]  Because we often come to God
[1700.28 --> 1701.86]  and we say to God,
[1702.30 --> 1704.86]  if you do this for us,
[1704.90 --> 1706.16]  if you help us,
[1706.38 --> 1707.72]  then we will,
[1708.38 --> 1709.62]  and we'll fill in the blanks,
[1709.66 --> 1710.46]  we will believe,
[1710.64 --> 1712.14]  we will dedicate our lives to you,
[1712.20 --> 1713.06]  we will serve you.
[1713.06 --> 1716.22]  But we're in a foxhole now, God,
[1716.34 --> 1717.84]  and we need your help.
[1719.52 --> 1721.22]  But that's not what happens here.
[1721.22 --> 1725.54]  They are responding
[1725.54 --> 1727.18]  after the danger is over.
[1728.18 --> 1730.02]  After the crisis is gone.
[1730.58 --> 1731.92]  The storm is gone.
[1732.32 --> 1733.46]  The waves are calm.
[1733.84 --> 1736.00]  The wind is calm.
[1736.78 --> 1738.14]  They're making progress.
[1739.32 --> 1740.28]  And they are afraid.
[1740.80 --> 1742.96]  And they offer a sacrifice.
[1743.68 --> 1745.16]  And the Hebrew catches it here.
[1745.24 --> 1747.52]  They offer a sacrifice to Yahweh,
[1748.20 --> 1749.74]  to the God of covenant.
[1749.74 --> 1753.84]  They become, it seems,
[1754.86 --> 1757.84]  believers in the God of the Hebrews.
[1758.62 --> 1761.52]  The God who created the heavens and the earth.
[1761.96 --> 1762.32]  Why?
[1762.84 --> 1765.28]  Not because of what he will do for them
[1765.28 --> 1767.98]  in the future,
[1768.76 --> 1771.28]  but what he has done for them
[1771.28 --> 1773.20]  in the past.
[1774.36 --> 1775.48]  And what has he done?
[1775.82 --> 1778.16]  He has accepted the sacrifice of one.
[1778.16 --> 1778.26]  One.
[1779.26 --> 1780.96]  To benefit the all.
[1783.22 --> 1783.92]  And later,
[1784.46 --> 1786.12]  the New Testament will teach,
[1786.74 --> 1788.72]  it is better that one man should die,
[1789.78 --> 1792.22]  than that all the nation should perish.
[1792.22 --> 1800.00]  He has taken the substitutionary sacrifice of Jonah
[1800.00 --> 1803.90]  and liberated from death
[1803.90 --> 1806.16]  the pagan sailors
[1806.16 --> 1810.52]  who have tossed him overboard.
[1810.52 --> 1840.50]  He has taken the
[1840.50 --> 1841.50]  a book of the Bible,
[1841.50 --> 1841.72]  a fiction,
[1841.72 --> 1843.12]  a story.
[1843.12 --> 1844.56]  I want to say to you,
[1845.96 --> 1847.28]  the resurrection of Jesus
[1847.28 --> 1848.60]  is a greater miracle
[1848.60 --> 1851.08]  than the creation of a great fish
[1851.08 --> 1852.16]  with an antechamber
[1852.16 --> 1854.44]  in which Jonah might have had a bench
[1854.44 --> 1854.88]  and a pillow.
[1857.80 --> 1859.76]  The resurrection of Jesus
[1859.76 --> 1864.46]  demonstrates the power of God
[1864.46 --> 1866.84]  and the concern of God.
[1867.84 --> 1869.74]  So let us think.
[1870.62 --> 1872.80]  What lessons do we learn
[1872.80 --> 1875.64]  about our identity
[1875.64 --> 1878.36]  as people redeemed
[1878.36 --> 1880.54]  in Jesus Christ?
[1880.54 --> 1885.82]  We are the messengers to the world,
[1885.82 --> 1890.84]  the tellers of the story of God's power,
[1891.50 --> 1894.02]  and God's power is demonstrated
[1894.02 --> 1895.10]  throughout this thing.
[1895.64 --> 1896.52]  There is a call.
[1897.74 --> 1898.94]  There is a commission.
[1899.78 --> 1901.18]  Go to that great city.
[1902.02 --> 1903.62]  People often don't like the commission
[1903.62 --> 1904.82]  and preach against it.
[1906.32 --> 1907.32]  Preach against it.
[1907.32 --> 1909.86]  We are talking about a God of love,
[1909.94 --> 1910.92]  not a God of wrath.
[1911.94 --> 1912.34]  Really?
[1913.98 --> 1914.46]  Really?
[1915.04 --> 1916.00]  I will tell you something
[1916.00 --> 1916.92]  that I hate.
[1917.48 --> 1918.96]  I hate COVID-19.
[1920.08 --> 1921.54]  I hate that virus.
[1922.10 --> 1923.80]  I hope scientists will discover
[1923.80 --> 1925.64]  a tool that will crush it
[1925.64 --> 1927.60]  absolutely and completely.
[1928.46 --> 1929.38]  And I think that is
[1929.38 --> 1931.66]  a perfectly justifiable hate.
[1931.66 --> 1936.02]  God hates sin.
[1937.40 --> 1939.28]  And he wants to crush it completely
[1939.28 --> 1941.76]  because it destroys relationships.
[1942.24 --> 1944.36]  It eats people up from the inside.
[1944.78 --> 1946.90]  It destroys the relationship with God,
[1947.28 --> 1948.72]  the relationship with themselves,
[1949.06 --> 1950.44]  the relationship with others,
[1950.74 --> 1952.28]  the relationship with the world.
[1953.46 --> 1954.66]  I was listening to the news
[1954.66 --> 1956.26]  coming up here this morning.
[1957.12 --> 1959.76]  One of the great destroyers in the world
[1959.76 --> 1961.96]  is what we do with our solid waste,
[1962.28 --> 1964.96]  with our telephones and computers
[1964.96 --> 1965.76]  and televisions
[1966.30 --> 1968.04]  that we can no longer use.
[1968.64 --> 1971.86]  And we just simply pile them up
[1971.86 --> 1973.86]  and then poor villages
[1973.86 --> 1976.20]  in Vietnam and in other places
[1976.20 --> 1977.60]  strip out the wire
[1977.60 --> 1979.98]  and the rest goes into landfill.
[1981.26 --> 1983.04]  You stop to ask yourself,
[1983.04 --> 1985.04]  what do we do
[1985.04 --> 1987.20]  with the care of this world?
[1988.10 --> 1990.10]  God is sovereign.
[1990.84 --> 1992.12]  And he comes to Jonah
[1992.12 --> 1993.04]  and he says, go.
[1994.14 --> 1994.90]  And Jonah says,
[1994.98 --> 1996.14]  no, I will not go.
[1997.30 --> 1999.44]  I would rather that they all die.
[2000.96 --> 2002.26]  And God reminds him,
[2002.30 --> 2002.70]  he says,
[2002.96 --> 2004.38]  I am the God of the Hebrews.
[2006.58 --> 2008.54]  And what were the Hebrew nation
[2008.54 --> 2010.14]  set aside for?
[2010.50 --> 2012.12]  Well, remember the words to Abraham?
[2012.12 --> 2014.06]  I will bless you
[2014.06 --> 2016.86]  so that you will be a blessing.
[2017.50 --> 2018.46]  To who?
[2019.24 --> 2020.34]  To the nations.
[2021.16 --> 2022.28]  To the people.
[2022.60 --> 2023.92]  And what does Jesus say?
[2024.76 --> 2028.76]  Go and make disciples of all nations
[2028.76 --> 2033.54]  and surely I will be with you always
[2033.54 --> 2035.44]  to the end of the age.
[2035.44 --> 2038.06]  So I'm going to invite you
[2038.06 --> 2039.94]  to think,
[2040.48 --> 2042.96]  who am I
[2042.96 --> 2044.64]  in Jesus?
[2045.60 --> 2048.72]  And what does God want me to do
[2048.72 --> 2052.28]  with those with whom
[2052.28 --> 2054.62]  I have relationship?
[2056.10 --> 2057.70]  The sailors on our boat.
[2057.70 --> 2060.92]  we're all in it together.
[2062.36 --> 2064.28]  How can we best share?
[2065.50 --> 2067.36]  How can we best bless?
[2068.16 --> 2069.52]  It may be as simple
[2069.52 --> 2071.96]  as wearing a mask
[2071.96 --> 2074.96]  or touching an elbow
[2074.96 --> 2078.24]  or encouraging people
[2078.24 --> 2078.26]  or encouraging people
[2078.26 --> 2079.82]  to believe
[2079.82 --> 2081.78]  that God
[2081.78 --> 2083.96]  will have the last word.
[2086.64 --> 2087.74]  So what do you think?
[2088.78 --> 2089.46]  Let's pray.
[2090.64 --> 2091.40]  Father God,
[2091.50 --> 2092.86]  thank you for this day.
[2093.86 --> 2095.40]  Thank you for this opportunity.
[2095.76 --> 2096.90]  Thank you for your word.
[2096.90 --> 2100.08]  Thank you for a person like Jonah
[2100.08 --> 2102.34]  who would dare to reflect
[2102.34 --> 2104.40]  on a very hard experience
[2104.40 --> 2105.22]  that he went through.
[2107.16 --> 2108.44]  Thank you for people
[2108.44 --> 2109.68]  who will show us
[2109.68 --> 2112.82]  how we can conduct ourselves respectfully.
[2114.36 --> 2116.50]  We pray that we may learn the lesson.
[2117.12 --> 2118.26]  That we may recognize
[2118.26 --> 2120.10]  that you are sovereign God.
[2120.76 --> 2121.90]  And that you can
[2121.90 --> 2123.36]  not only send a great fish
[2123.36 --> 2124.58]  but raise the dead
[2124.58 --> 2126.92]  and have the last word.
[2127.64 --> 2128.56]  We praise you
[2128.56 --> 2129.72]  and we ask that you would
[2129.72 --> 2131.10]  equip us to think
[2131.10 --> 2131.80]  clearly
[2131.80 --> 2133.22]  and accurately
[2133.22 --> 2134.94]  and in such a way
[2134.94 --> 2135.84]  as to honor you.
[2136.48 --> 2137.42]  In Jesus' name.
[2138.08 --> 2138.56]  Amen.
