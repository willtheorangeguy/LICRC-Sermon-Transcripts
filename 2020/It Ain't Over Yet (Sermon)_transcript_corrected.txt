[1.00 → 11.22] We're going to continue our worship by reading together from Psalm 148 and then spending some time in that text.
[11.32 → 17.34] If you have a Bible handy, I would invite you to open that up to Psalm 148 or on your phone or device
[17.34 → 24.30] and have that in front of you as we will look pretty closely at a few verses going through that psalm.
[24.30 → 31.46] With Psalm 148 open before us, let me pray before I read.
[34.60 → 43.16] Lord God, we come to your word, and we cry our saying, speak to us today.
[44.28 → 48.26] Speak to our hearts with the beauty of your glory.
[48.26 → 55.40] Make much of yourself in our midst through your word that our hearts might sing.
[56.70 → 62.10] May we join with all creation and all the angels in singing your praises today.
[62.30 → 66.10] In Christ Jesus alone we pray. Amen.
[69.08 → 72.10] This is Psalm 148.
[72.10 → 75.56] Praise the Lord.
[76.24 → 77.90] Praise the Lord from the heavens.
[78.22 → 80.24] Praise him from the heights above.
[81.18 → 82.80] Praise him, all his angels.
[83.06 → 85.12] Praise him, all his heavenly hosts.
[85.66 → 87.32] Praise him, sun and moon.
[88.04 → 89.92] Praise him, all you shining stars.
[90.60 → 95.16] Praise him, you highest heavens and you waters above the skies.
[95.58 → 100.20] Let them praise the name of the Lord for he commanded, and they were created.
[100.20 → 103.90] He set them in place forever and ever.
[104.34 → 106.94] He gave a decree that will never pass away.
[108.00 → 112.62] Praise the Lord from the earth, you great sea creatures and all ocean depths,
[113.24 → 118.38] lightning and hail, snow and clouds, stormy winds that do his bidding,
[118.80 → 122.28] you mountains and all hills, fruit trees and all cedars,
[122.72 → 126.06] wild animals and all cattle, small creatures and flying birds,
[126.48 → 128.40] kings of the earth and all nations,
[128.40 → 135.14] you princes and all rulers on earth, young men and maiden, old men and children.
[136.14 → 143.14] Let them praise the name of the Lord for his name alone is exalted.
[144.36 → 147.54] His splendour is above the earth and the heavens.
[147.54 → 151.50] He has raised up for his people a horn.
[152.50 → 158.70] The praise of all his saints of Israel, the people close to his heart.
[159.56 → 161.28] Praise the Lord.
[162.04 → 163.40] This is the word of the Lord.
[163.40 → 173.16] In many ways, I love the Sunday after Christmas.
[174.04 → 180.66] Quickly, the rest of our culture and society sort of moves on to the next thing, right?
[181.04 → 185.14] Immediately after Christmas, Boxing Day appears for a blip,
[185.26 → 186.66] although it used to be Boxing Day.
[186.66 → 188.86] Now it's Boxing Week, it seems.
[190.06 → 195.66] But even quickly after that, we move into New Year's Eve celebrations and the like.
[195.74 → 200.24] People leave Christmas behind almost as fast as it appears after Thanksgiving.
[201.82 → 206.74] Or maybe Halloween, depending on your order of life together.
[206.74 → 215.42] I have a friend back home in Ontario who makes much every week or every year on Boxing Day
[215.42 → 220.14] of taking the Christmas tree out, bringing it to the back 40, and burning it as quickly as he can.
[220.98 → 223.08] Christmas comes and it leaves.
[223.96 → 225.22] But not in the church.
[226.46 → 231.98] Technically speaking, if we follow the liturgical calendar, the common lectionary,
[231.98 → 236.82] Christmas lasts for the two Sundays that follow December 25,
[237.12 → 239.62] whatever that happens to be in that calendar year.
[239.72 → 241.98] And so this year, that's through January 3rd.
[242.98 → 248.62] Now Christmas works out to a roughly two-week season that follows the season of Advent.
[248.92 → 254.46] As Mike was saying earlier, Advent is that season full of expectation and longing and waiting.
[254.92 → 257.68] And then you have Christmas, which lasts for about two weeks,
[257.68 → 261.04] and that's followed by the season of Epiphany, right?
[261.04 → 265.14] It's the season of the revelation of Christ to the Gentiles.
[265.18 → 268.92] And that traditionally starts with the visit of the Magi, right?
[268.98 → 271.90] Epiphany means to reveal or to display.
[272.74 → 278.66] My point is, theologically or liturgically, it's still Christmas around here.
[279.88 → 288.16] And that means that we can be extra intentional in our marvelling at the majesty of the incarnation, right?
[288.16 → 293.50] To be still amazed at the beauty of Emmanuel, God with us.
[295.20 → 302.04] If you joined us for our Christmas Day service, the last words that I spoke in that service are,
[302.22 → 308.28] in fact, the last words that we heard and have been hearing from the angels spoken to the shepherds,
[308.38 → 311.04] our Emmanuel kids' memory work all month long.
[311.04 → 315.40] And the last song that we sang was glory to God, right?
[315.44 → 318.88] We sang the song of the angels at the birth of Jesus.
[319.10 → 326.48] This morning, using Psalm 148, we're going to continue singing praise.
[326.48 → 330.64] Now, if you read along with me there, you saw it on the screen.
[330.78 → 335.38] Psalm 148 is pretty simple in its main theme, right?
[335.42 → 339.58] It's easy enough to see if you just look quickly at the verses.
[339.84 → 345.36] Ten times you get the imperative, you get the command to praise the Lord in the text.
[345.44 → 347.36] In Hebrew, that's hallelujah.
[348.18 → 349.30] Sounds familiar, right?
[349.30 → 352.12] Most of us know the word hallelujah, right?
[352.28 → 356.92] And then in addition to that, there are two more instances of incomplete verbs,
[356.98 → 360.20] of future tense verbs that will say they will praise the name of the Lord.
[360.52 → 363.66] Now, obviously, this psalm then is a call to praise.
[363.82 → 364.86] It's a command to sing.
[364.94 → 365.86] It's a call to worship.
[366.02 → 372.90] And so as we go through Psalm 148, we're going to see three distinct things.
[372.90 → 381.96] First, we will see that all creation is and will praise the Lord God for who he is, right?
[382.06 → 386.62] And as a result of that, we are commanded to do so.
[387.76 → 394.70] At the crown of creation then, number two, humanity has a special call to praise the Lord.
[394.70 → 405.20] But the jewel in that crown, that's God's chosen people, his church, have an extra special call to worship God.
[405.88 → 414.14] And then finally, we will land with this ladder, this call to worship God is made truly and obediently possible
[414.14 → 418.98] because God will raise up a horn for his people.
[418.98 → 425.70] And a horn that we know is not a trumpet, but it is Jesus.
[426.94 → 428.36] And so let's start with the first.
[429.32 → 433.38] That all creation is called to praise God.
[434.40 → 438.26] Now look at the whole text, and this is why I wanted you to have it in front of you.
[438.50 → 447.98] There is a clear and sporadic structure, or clear and specific structure, to the whole of the text here.
[447.98 → 451.60] There are four verses and then a chorus that begins with,
[452.04 → 454.48] let them praise the name of the Lord for two verses.
[454.88 → 459.02] And then there are another section of six verses and a chorus that begins,
[459.20 → 460.86] let them praise the name of the Lord.
[461.48 → 467.86] Now in each major section, you get every day of the creation story.
[469.04 → 474.00] I want to suggest to you this morning that the psalmist has in mind,
[474.00 → 481.56] when he writes this call to praise, he has in mind the story of creation from Genesis 1.
[482.22 → 484.44] Now there's some pretty clear parallels here, and let me show you.
[484.48 → 488.06] If you have Bibles in front of you, you can quickly jump to Genesis 1.
[488.44 → 490.38] That's the very first chapter in the Bible.
[490.52 → 492.40] It's the story of God creating the world.
[493.12 → 496.10] If you don't have a Bible, or if you want to just see the connections explicitly,
[496.10 → 499.58] we've put together a graphic to help us see that,
[499.66 → 503.50] and that will appear on your screens right now, or in a second or so,
[504.30 → 505.26] and we can see it.
[506.14 → 507.72] Genesis 1 begins,
[507.72 → 512.28] In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
[513.00 → 517.14] Now the earth was formless and empty, and darkness was over the surface of the deep,
[517.20 → 520.46] and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.
[521.38 → 522.54] And God said,
[522.90 → 525.28] Let there be light, and there was light.
[525.72 → 529.28] And God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness.
[529.74 → 533.40] God called the light day, and the darkness he called night.
[533.80 → 537.14] And there was evening, and there was morning, the first day.
[538.54 → 545.54] Now that story of creation starts with a sort of nebulous unknown of chaos churning, right?
[545.56 → 547.52] It's formless and empty.
[547.52 → 552.94] There's a darkness that is over the deep, and the Spirit of God is over the waters.
[553.62 → 555.28] Now I don't know exactly what that is.
[555.32 → 557.04] I don't think anyone really does.
[557.32 → 563.34] But into that formless and void chaos, God speaks, and creation is born.
[564.52 → 567.66] Now verse 1 of Psalm 148 says,
[567.72 → 570.52] Praise Him from the heavens, or sky.
[570.98 → 574.78] Praise Him in the heights above, or another way to translate that is high places.
[575.18 → 580.54] The Spirit of God is hovering over whatever that is in the heights above.
[581.38 → 587.66] And in this story, you even get prehistory, still created, but prehistory being called to praise God.
[588.22 → 588.86] The psalm says,
[588.86 → 590.66] Praise Him, all His angels.
[591.40 → 596.18] But the point is that everything that is not God is created, even the angels,
[596.18 → 601.86] and everything that is not God is called to worship or praise God.
[603.58 → 606.78] Now in the Genesis story, on day two, you read,
[606.78 → 611.74] Let there be an expanse between the waters to separate water from water.
[612.54 → 618.52] So God made the expanse and separated the water under the expanse from the water above it.
[618.88 → 619.64] And it was so.
[620.38 → 624.84] God called the expanse sky, and there was evening, and there was morning the second day.
[625.54 → 628.48] So you have water above and water below.
[628.48 → 631.86] And verse 4 of Psalm 148 says,
[632.24 → 636.32] Praise Him, you highest heavens, and you waters above the skies.
[637.26 → 643.66] Now waters above the skies is sometimes called the firmament in ancient Near Eastern cosmogony.
[644.00 → 648.78] And it's what comes crashing down in the flood story of Genesis 6 through 9.
[649.08 → 652.72] And in Genesis 7, verse 11, it says,
[652.90 → 654.88] The floodgates of the heavens opened.
[655.16 → 656.56] That's what we're talking about here.
[656.56 → 664.66] Thomas LeBlanc said that the ancients thought there was an ethereal and lofty ocean
[664.66 → 667.86] in which the worlds floated like ships on a sea.
[668.22 → 669.76] This is what crashes down.
[669.84 → 673.52] And this too is what is called to worship God.
[674.58 → 677.26] And then day three, right, in the Genesis story,
[677.32 → 679.94] the waters are gathered, and you get dry ground.
[680.02 → 682.30] And that ground is populated with vegetation.
[683.44 → 684.74] Verse 7 of our psalm says,
[684.74 → 686.26] Praise the Lord from the earth.
[686.26 → 686.98] And verse 9,
[687.54 → 691.12] You mountains and hills, all fruit trees and cedars.
[691.72 → 694.32] Right down through the days of creation we can go.
[694.44 → 697.38] Day four is the creation of the sun and the moon and the stars,
[697.54 → 700.14] which we read in verse 3 of Psalm 148.
[700.26 → 701.84] Praise Him, sun and moon.
[702.00 → 703.94] Praise Him, all you shining stars.
[704.90 → 707.76] Day five, the oceans and the skies are filled.
[708.46 → 709.10] And we read,
[709.20 → 712.92] Praise Him, you great sea creatures and all ocean depths.
[712.92 → 716.16] And on day five, the skies are filled with flying creatures.
[716.16 → 724.66] And in verse 10, the flying birds are invited into this chorus of universal praise of Lord.
[725.82 → 732.06] On day six, God starts with wild animals and livestock and all creatures that move along the ground.
[732.06 → 734.62] And Psalm 148 verse 10 says,
[734.62 → 739.58] Wild animals and all cattle, small creatures, right, are all commanded to praise the Lord.
[740.06 → 743.52] And then day six ends with God creating humanity.
[743.52 → 745.56] And the Lord said,
[745.56 → 748.64] Let us make humanity in our image, in our likeness,
[748.74 → 752.62] so that they may rule over the fish of the sea and the birds in the sky
[752.62 → 754.62] and over the livestock and all the wild animals
[754.62 → 756.90] and over all the creatures that move along the ground.
[757.32 → 761.70] So God created mankind in His own image.
[761.80 → 765.84] In the image of God, He created them male and female.
[766.02 → 766.86] He created them.
[766.86 → 773.70] All humanity, every station, every nation, every age, every gender,
[774.10 → 777.36] are called into the song of praise to the Lord.
[777.74 → 778.34] In verse 11,
[778.78 → 780.78] Kings of the earth and all nations,
[781.20 → 783.34] you princes and all rulers on earth,
[783.46 → 786.48] young men and women, elderly and children.
[787.30 → 791.76] Right, over the scope of the whole of Psalm 148
[791.76 → 796.50] is every bit of creation and history and prehistory
[796.50 → 801.02] called together into the hymn of praise to the Lord.
[802.64 → 807.52] I love how theologian D.A. Carson puts it.
[808.08 → 808.66] He says,
[809.66 → 813.12] The denizens of the earth's oceans,
[814.00 → 817.18] the varied precipitation that waters the ground,
[817.74 → 820.12] the fury of unleashed storms,
[820.12 → 823.26] the majesty and beauty of mountains and hills,
[823.42 → 826.42] the spectacular diversity and colour and beauty
[826.42 → 828.30] of the earth's flora and fauna,
[828.62 → 832.14] the scarcely imaginable array of the earth's births,
[832.14 → 835.70] all attest mutely but powerfully
[835.70 → 838.56] to the goodness and greatness of God.
[839.54 → 841.04] As part of that creation,
[841.46 → 844.64] human beings in all their diversity of their ranks
[844.64 → 845.88] and stations in life
[845.88 → 848.68] join this universal chorus of praise,
[848.68 → 851.42] not simply because he is bigger than we are,
[851.68 → 854.38] but because no matter how highly we envisage,
[854.58 → 855.98] his glory is splendour,
[856.24 → 857.74] it is higher yet,
[857.90 → 860.24] higher than anything and everything
[860.24 → 862.10] in all creation.
[864.62 → 867.90] All creation is and will
[867.90 → 870.62] praise the Lord for who he is,
[870.62 → 874.18] and thus we are commanded to do so.
[874.18 → 879.80] Now these words from Carson
[879.80 → 882.76] also introduce our second point.
[883.40 → 884.46] As Carson said,
[884.86 → 886.02] As part of that creation,
[886.18 → 887.82] human beings in all their diversity
[887.82 → 889.80] and of their ranks of stations in life
[889.80 → 892.06] join this universal chorus of praise.
[892.48 → 894.32] Or, as I'm putting it today,
[894.74 → 896.12] the crown of creation,
[896.38 → 896.78] humanity,
[897.04 → 900.22] has a special call to praise the Lord,
[900.22 → 901.82] but the jewel in that crown,
[901.96 → 903.02] God's chosen people,
[903.10 → 903.62] his church,
[903.82 → 905.84] have an extra special call.
[906.18 → 907.10] So the first part of that.
[907.64 → 911.56] All humanity is called to praise God,
[912.24 → 914.62] just as the rest of creation
[914.62 → 917.62] is in its own way already doing.
[918.22 → 918.38] All right?
[918.44 → 920.28] Let them praise the name of the Lord
[920.28 → 922.14] for he alone is exalted.
[922.60 → 924.46] His splendour is above the earth
[924.46 → 925.32] and the heavens.
[925.32 → 927.26] Now first,
[927.90 → 930.64] notice that God is praised
[930.64 → 933.74] not because of what he has done,
[934.54 → 935.60] at least not yet,
[936.08 → 937.94] as a reason to praise him.
[938.16 → 939.74] That becomes one, of course,
[940.20 → 941.64] but in the first place,
[941.76 → 943.60] God is praised precisely
[943.60 → 946.38] because he is praiseworthy.
[947.08 → 947.20] Right?
[947.30 → 948.84] God is good and worthy
[948.84 → 950.24] of all honour and praise
[950.24 → 951.50] and majesty and power,
[951.74 → 953.58] even if he never created.
[953.58 → 956.92] Even if God never did a thing,
[957.28 → 959.14] God would be worthy of your worship.
[960.14 → 960.62] Now, of course,
[960.68 → 962.02] if God never did a thing,
[962.12 → 963.74] there would be no you to worship,
[964.34 → 966.50] but God would still be God
[966.50 → 967.66] and that's enough
[967.66 → 971.68] for him to be worthy of our worship.
[973.00 → 974.50] And also see carefully
[974.50 → 977.86] that God doesn't need your worship,
[978.50 → 980.00] but he does command it.
[981.08 → 981.22] Right?
[981.22 → 982.44] And not just in the sense
[982.44 → 984.08] of the imperative,
[984.46 → 986.26] of the must worship,
[986.40 → 987.40] but he commands it
[987.40 → 988.90] also in the sense
[988.90 → 990.56] of beautiful,
[990.82 → 991.40] in the sense
[991.40 → 993.88] of his majesty
[993.88 → 996.36] captivates your heart
[996.36 → 997.50] and your imagination.
[997.92 → 1000.06] He captures your attention.
[1002.26 → 1004.50] When a person is,
[1004.84 → 1006.08] when it's said of a person
[1006.08 → 1008.04] that they command a room,
[1008.04 → 1011.36] that means that everyone's attention
[1011.36 → 1013.62] is fixated on them.
[1014.06 → 1014.28] Right?
[1014.32 → 1016.04] That they are drawn to that person.
[1017.32 → 1018.48] Now, similarly,
[1018.60 → 1021.94] our praises are drawn to God.
[1022.08 → 1024.18] We are drawn to God.
[1024.72 → 1026.62] Not only by virtue of being created
[1026.62 → 1028.08] in his image,
[1028.14 → 1029.92] though that no doubt helps
[1029.92 → 1031.82] because God has thus made us
[1031.82 → 1033.74] like himself and for himself,
[1033.88 → 1035.88] but we are also drawn to God,
[1035.88 → 1037.18] like all creation,
[1037.18 → 1039.78] to sing the glory of his name
[1039.78 → 1040.94] and his nature.
[1041.64 → 1043.50] And this is true of all humanity,
[1043.66 → 1045.74] whether we believe in God or not.
[1046.38 → 1046.60] Right?
[1046.66 → 1049.80] Our hearts hunger and thirst for him.
[1050.88 → 1051.94] We long for him
[1051.94 → 1053.66] even if we don't admit
[1053.66 → 1055.62] or even if we don't know
[1055.62 → 1056.98] that we do,
[1057.08 → 1058.42] even if we can't put words
[1058.42 → 1059.40] to that longing.
[1060.30 → 1061.42] And this is why so many people
[1061.42 → 1063.78] try to fill that longing,
[1064.04 → 1065.14] that emptiness
[1065.14 → 1067.14] in their lives
[1067.14 → 1068.60] with things or people
[1068.60 → 1069.74] or money or power
[1069.74 → 1071.70] or drinks or drugs
[1071.70 → 1072.76] or whatever.
[1073.02 → 1074.46] It's because our hearts
[1074.46 → 1076.38] were made to worship.
[1076.88 → 1079.32] We are made to love our creator
[1079.32 → 1082.12] and the misplaced affection
[1082.12 → 1083.68] of our hearts
[1083.68 → 1084.90] is working out
[1084.90 → 1086.08] that sort of normative
[1086.08 → 1087.60] creational desire
[1087.60 → 1089.10] and it's being directed
[1089.10 → 1090.32] in the wrong way.
[1091.42 → 1095.12] The whole of humanity
[1095.12 → 1100.06] is called to worship God.
[1101.00 → 1102.88] The crown of creation,
[1103.46 → 1103.88] humanity,
[1104.12 → 1105.08] has a special call
[1105.08 → 1105.94] to worship God.
[1106.20 → 1108.26] But the jewel in that crown,
[1108.42 → 1109.46] God's chosen people,
[1109.54 → 1110.04] his church,
[1110.44 → 1111.20] you and me,
[1111.28 → 1111.90] all of us
[1111.90 → 1113.32] who by grace through faith
[1113.32 → 1114.40] believe in him,
[1114.64 → 1116.80] we have an extra special call
[1116.80 → 1118.68] to worship him.
[1119.58 → 1119.84] Right?
[1119.84 → 1121.22] If all creation sings
[1121.22 → 1122.32] and will sing
[1122.32 → 1123.10] and is commanded
[1123.10 → 1124.24] to sing the glories
[1124.24 → 1124.86] of the Lord,
[1125.12 → 1126.32] how much more so
[1126.32 → 1127.24] will you
[1127.24 → 1128.82] who know something
[1128.82 → 1129.92] of this God,
[1130.86 → 1131.84] how much more so
[1131.84 → 1133.20] will you be called
[1133.20 → 1134.72] to worship?
[1135.62 → 1136.44] And not just that
[1136.44 → 1137.66] and not just here,
[1137.76 → 1137.96] right,
[1138.00 → 1138.54] in church,
[1138.62 → 1139.76] whether you're in the building
[1139.76 → 1140.70] or you're at home,
[1140.76 → 1141.78] which is more likely,
[1141.96 → 1142.10] right,
[1142.10 → 1143.48] not just even on Sunday
[1143.48 → 1145.48] when it's relatively safe
[1145.48 → 1146.20] and expected
[1146.20 → 1147.20] and kind of normal
[1147.20 → 1147.80] to do it,
[1148.04 → 1148.20] right,
[1148.20 → 1148.94] if all creation
[1148.94 → 1150.18] is commanded to sing
[1150.18 → 1151.08] and does sing
[1151.08 → 1152.68] in response to who God is,
[1152.82 → 1154.16] how much more so
[1154.16 → 1155.44] is your whole life
[1155.44 → 1156.46] meant to be
[1156.46 → 1157.44] a hymn of praise
[1157.44 → 1158.04] to God
[1158.04 → 1159.56] who has created you
[1159.56 → 1160.90] and who has redeemed you?
[1161.64 → 1161.84] Right?
[1161.90 → 1162.52] Your work
[1162.52 → 1164.18] is a song of praise.
[1164.28 → 1164.92] Your play
[1164.92 → 1166.72] is a song of praise.
[1166.82 → 1167.56] Your hobbies
[1167.56 → 1169.16] are a song of praise.
[1169.40 → 1170.06] You're crafting,
[1170.26 → 1170.90] you're puzzling,
[1171.00 → 1171.54] you're reading,
[1171.92 → 1172.44] you're gaming,
[1172.68 → 1173.80] your D&D
[1173.80 → 1175.30] or your Coding,
[1175.56 → 1176.82] everything you do
[1176.82 → 1178.56] is in praise to God
[1178.56 → 1181.28] or it ought to be.
[1184.10 → 1185.08] And as we continue
[1185.08 → 1186.88] the song of Christmas
[1186.88 → 1188.26] this year,
[1188.76 → 1190.92] as you see God
[1190.92 → 1192.80] come down in Jesus
[1192.80 → 1194.46] in answer to prayer
[1194.46 → 1195.50] and provision
[1195.50 → 1196.58] in response
[1196.58 → 1197.66] to that expectation
[1197.66 → 1198.38] and longing
[1198.38 → 1199.76] that filled the Advent season,
[1200.12 → 1201.70] are you worshipping God
[1201.70 → 1202.60] in all that you do?
[1203.80 → 1204.40] Or are you holding
[1204.40 → 1205.12] something back?
[1205.94 → 1207.12] Or are you misplacing,
[1207.64 → 1208.36] misdirecting
[1208.36 → 1209.68] your affections?
[1210.10 → 1210.96] Does every aspect
[1210.96 → 1212.02] of your life,
[1212.10 → 1213.30] does every square inch
[1213.30 → 1214.42] of your being
[1214.42 → 1215.66] belong to God?
[1216.56 → 1217.70] Because in reality,
[1218.24 → 1219.12] every micron,
[1219.62 → 1220.28] every atom
[1220.28 → 1222.18] and subatomic particle,
[1222.64 → 1223.62] every bit of matter
[1223.62 → 1224.72] and antimatter,
[1225.08 → 1226.58] all of it does.
[1228.64 → 1229.94] Make this season
[1229.94 → 1232.30] about praising the Creator.
[1232.30 → 1234.44] And not just here
[1234.44 → 1235.14] on Sunday
[1235.14 → 1235.92] when it's expected
[1235.92 → 1236.52] and safe,
[1236.96 → 1238.04] but everywhere
[1238.04 → 1239.96] and in every way.
[1241.88 → 1243.34] And let me be really clear
[1243.34 → 1246.50] because I get it.
[1248.26 → 1249.54] Lots of us are tired
[1249.54 → 1250.84] right now.
[1252.36 → 1253.80] Lots of us have had enough
[1253.80 → 1256.78] and we just can't
[1256.78 → 1258.44] do it anymore.
[1259.86 → 1261.14] There's a weariness
[1261.14 → 1263.40] that seeps
[1263.40 → 1264.74] into our bones
[1264.74 → 1266.00] right now.
[1267.76 → 1268.56] And it makes
[1268.56 → 1269.34] the normal parts
[1269.34 → 1270.12] of life hard,
[1270.94 → 1272.08] let alone
[1272.08 → 1272.70] the extraordinary
[1272.70 → 1273.66] parts of life.
[1273.66 → 1277.18] And right now
[1277.18 → 1278.10] we may not just
[1278.10 → 1279.56] feel like
[1279.56 → 1280.80] we can worship.
[1282.10 → 1283.24] There may not be
[1283.24 → 1283.84] a song
[1283.84 → 1284.44] that we want
[1284.44 → 1284.98] to sing
[1284.98 → 1287.30] and we can't
[1287.30 → 1287.78] do it.
[1290.88 → 1291.88] And God has made
[1291.88 → 1292.84] provision for that
[1292.84 → 1295.28] because this worship
[1295.28 → 1296.26] that we are called
[1296.26 → 1296.60] to,
[1297.54 → 1299.30] this call
[1299.30 → 1300.24] that is extended
[1300.24 → 1301.70] to all of humanity
[1301.70 → 1302.32] right,
[1302.50 → 1303.76] is interrupted,
[1304.04 → 1304.98] is muted,
[1305.32 → 1306.62] is cut short
[1306.62 → 1308.26] because of sin
[1308.26 → 1309.18] and because of
[1309.18 → 1310.02] the realities
[1310.02 → 1311.22] we face in the world.
[1311.32 → 1312.28] And apart from God
[1312.28 → 1313.36] acting in us
[1313.36 → 1313.82] and through us
[1313.82 → 1314.26] and for us,
[1314.36 → 1315.88] we can't do it
[1315.88 → 1316.52] right now.
[1318.16 → 1319.30] But that's
[1319.30 → 1321.68] God's point
[1321.68 → 1322.74] in this psalm.
[1323.66 → 1323.84] Right?
[1323.92 → 1324.88] This call
[1324.88 → 1325.66] to worship
[1325.66 → 1326.26] right,
[1326.32 → 1327.12] is truly
[1327.12 → 1329.04] and obediently
[1329.04 → 1329.86] possible
[1329.86 → 1331.12] in our lives
[1331.12 → 1332.44] only because
[1332.44 → 1333.36] God
[1333.36 → 1334.78] will raise up
[1334.78 → 1335.58] a horn
[1335.58 → 1336.72] for his people.
[1337.72 → 1338.34] A horn
[1338.34 → 1339.36] whom we know
[1339.36 → 1340.04] to be
[1340.04 → 1341.06] Jesus.
[1342.68 → 1343.50] The priest
[1343.50 → 1344.42] Zachariah
[1344.42 → 1345.60] at the circumcision
[1345.60 → 1346.56] and naming day
[1346.56 → 1347.38] of his son
[1347.38 → 1347.80] John,
[1347.88 → 1348.40] who we know
[1348.40 → 1349.10] will become
[1349.10 → 1349.86] John the Baptist,
[1350.46 → 1350.64] right,
[1350.72 → 1351.38] this priest
[1351.38 → 1352.22] Zachariah
[1352.22 → 1353.18] on that day
[1353.18 → 1354.48] says of Jesus
[1354.48 → 1355.70] who is not yet born,
[1355.70 → 1356.70] the Lord
[1356.70 → 1357.84] has raised up
[1357.84 → 1358.64] a horn
[1358.64 → 1359.64] of salvation
[1359.64 → 1360.38] for us.
[1361.44 → 1361.62] Right?
[1361.66 → 1362.06] Already
[1362.06 → 1363.30] this is being
[1363.30 → 1363.78] connected
[1363.78 → 1364.62] and revealed
[1364.62 → 1365.68] as Jesus.
[1365.84 → 1366.32] This horn
[1366.32 → 1367.02] of salvation
[1367.02 → 1368.28] who will make
[1368.28 → 1368.96] worship
[1368.96 → 1369.82] possible.
[1370.26 → 1370.48] Right?
[1370.52 → 1371.52] The unimaginably
[1371.52 → 1372.34] great God
[1372.34 → 1373.40] has not only
[1373.40 → 1374.14] called out
[1374.14 → 1374.92] of his own
[1374.92 → 1375.48] people
[1375.48 → 1376.54] to worship
[1376.54 → 1376.94] them
[1376.94 → 1377.98] but has raised
[1377.98 → 1378.90] up for us
[1378.90 → 1379.60] a horn,
[1379.98 → 1380.12] right,
[1380.16 → 1380.78] a symbol
[1380.78 → 1381.46] of a king,
[1381.76 → 1381.90] right,
[1381.96 → 1382.62] for the praise
[1382.62 → 1383.58] of all his saints.
[1384.32 → 1384.50] Right?
[1384.52 → 1384.84] And living
[1384.84 → 1385.66] on this side
[1385.66 → 1386.24] of Jesus'
[1386.60 → 1386.98] Christmas,
[1387.20 → 1387.84] on this side
[1387.84 → 1388.56] of the incarnation,
[1389.12 → 1390.02] living on this side
[1390.02 → 1390.96] of Easter
[1390.96 → 1391.74] after Jesus'
[1392.04 → 1392.96] life and death
[1392.96 → 1393.70] and resurrection,
[1394.04 → 1394.72] we know
[1394.72 → 1395.44] that the ultimate
[1395.44 → 1396.48] king in the line
[1396.48 → 1397.04] of David
[1397.04 → 1398.58] really is him,
[1398.70 → 1400.04] really is Jesus
[1400.04 → 1401.70] and so our praise
[1401.70 → 1403.12] joins the rest
[1403.12 → 1403.86] of the universe
[1403.86 → 1404.74] with particular
[1404.74 → 1405.38] intensity
[1405.38 → 1406.48] and particular
[1406.48 → 1406.96] gratitude
[1406.96 → 1408.16] because we
[1408.16 → 1409.36] know him,
[1409.52 → 1410.78] we know Jesus
[1410.78 → 1412.16] who lived the life
[1412.16 → 1413.34] I should have lived,
[1413.34 → 1415.06] Jesus who died
[1415.06 → 1415.70] the death
[1415.70 → 1416.92] that I deserved
[1416.92 → 1417.68] and Jesus
[1417.68 → 1418.88] who three days
[1418.88 → 1419.80] later was raised
[1419.80 → 1421.08] victorious over sin
[1421.08 → 1421.58] and death
[1421.58 → 1423.02] and now in his grace
[1423.02 → 1424.00] by faith
[1424.00 → 1424.96] grants me
[1424.96 → 1425.86] his righteousness
[1425.86 → 1427.44] even as my sin
[1427.44 → 1428.52] is put over
[1428.52 → 1429.26] to him.
[1429.48 → 1430.20] This Jesus
[1430.20 → 1431.20] grants us
[1431.20 → 1432.26] the victory
[1432.26 → 1433.58] of God.
[1435.64 → 1436.82] That's why we can
[1436.82 → 1437.16] worship
[1437.16 → 1439.94] even when we are
[1439.94 → 1440.42] tired,
[1440.42 → 1441.70] even when we are
[1441.70 → 1442.54] at our wits end,
[1442.66 → 1444.14] even when it feels
[1444.14 → 1445.16] like our life
[1445.16 → 1446.34] is crumbling
[1446.34 → 1449.46] because he has
[1449.46 → 1450.88] made a way.
[1452.18 → 1453.48] He has made it
[1453.48 → 1453.98] possible
[1453.98 → 1455.92] to praise the Lord
[1455.92 → 1458.14] and that
[1458.14 → 1459.86] makes me
[1459.86 → 1461.24] want to sing.
[1462.36 → 1463.10] Not only
[1463.10 → 1464.86] are your songs
[1464.86 → 1466.10] a song of praise
[1466.10 → 1466.72] to the Lord
[1466.72 → 1467.52] our God
[1467.52 → 1468.14] in Jesus
[1468.14 → 1469.28] but your life
[1469.28 → 1470.46] is a song
[1470.46 → 1471.60] and all creation
[1471.60 → 1472.88] is a song
[1472.88 → 1473.64] to the glory
[1473.64 → 1474.52] of God
[1474.52 → 1475.22] and so then
[1475.22 → 1475.92] let's sing
[1475.92 → 1476.66] with the angels
[1476.66 → 1477.58] of Luke 2.
[1477.74 → 1478.44] Let's sing
[1478.44 → 1479.16] with the angels
[1479.16 → 1480.38] of Revelation 4
[1480.38 → 1481.20] and 5.
[1481.32 → 1481.82] Let's sing
[1481.82 → 1482.70] with the great cloud
[1482.70 → 1483.20] of witnesses
[1483.20 → 1483.98] who have gone on
[1483.98 → 1484.52] before us
