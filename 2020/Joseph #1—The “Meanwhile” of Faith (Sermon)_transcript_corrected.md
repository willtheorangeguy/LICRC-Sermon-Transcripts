[0.00 → 11.98] So, our scripture reading this morning is Genesis 37, the entire chapter.
[13.66 → 23.22] And as we read scripture this morning, as we go through the story of Joseph, keep in mind, this is our story.
[23.22 → 29.00] If you are part of God's family, this is your story.
[30.00 → 38.22] Jacob, we read, lived in the land where his father had stayed, the land of Canaan.
[39.10 → 42.88] This is the account of Jacob's family line.
[44.12 → 54.28] Joseph, a young man of 17, was tending the flocks with his brothers, the sons of Bihar and the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives.
[54.68 → 58.42] And he brought their father a bad report about them.
[58.42 → 67.08] Now, Israel loved Joseph more than any of his other sons, because he had been born to him in his old age.
[67.64 → 70.26] And he made an ornate robe for him.
[70.98 → 79.02] When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, they hated him, could not speak a kind word to him.
[79.02 → 82.64] Joseph had a dream.
[82.64 → 87.62] And when he told it to his brothers, they hated him all the more.
[88.24 → 90.44] He said to them, listen to this dream I had.
[90.82 → 96.74] We were binding sheaves of grain out in the field when suddenly my sheave rose and stood upright,
[97.00 → 101.30] while your sheaves gathered around mine and bowed down to it.
[101.30 → 107.12] His brothers said to him, do you intend to reign over us?
[107.74 → 109.78] Will you actually rule us?
[110.74 → 114.38] And they hated him all the more because of his dream and what he had said.
[115.78 → 119.20] Then he had another dream, and he told it to his brothers.
[120.26 → 127.34] Listen, he said, I had another dream, and this time the sun and moon and 11 stars were bowing down to me.
[127.34 → 133.32] When he told his father, as well as his brothers, his father rebuked him and said,
[133.84 → 135.30] what is this dream you had?
[135.88 → 141.38] Will your mother and I and your brothers actually come and bow down to the ground before you?
[143.20 → 145.34] His brothers were jealous of him.
[146.60 → 151.00] But his father, note, kept the matter in mind.
[151.00 → 156.02] Now, his brothers had gone to graze their father's flocks near Shechem,
[156.20 → 160.58] and Israel said to Joseph, as you know, your brothers are grazing the flocks near Shechem.
[160.78 → 162.82] Come, I'm going to send you to them.
[163.64 → 164.76] Very well, he replied.
[165.18 → 169.36] So he said to him, go and see if all is well with your brothers and with the flocks,
[169.42 → 171.54] and bring word back to me.
[172.48 → 174.84] Then he sent them off from the valley of Hebron.
[175.54 → 180.84] When Joseph arrived at Shechem, a man found him wandering around in the fields and asked him,
[181.00 → 182.94] what are you looking for?
[183.64 → 185.28] He replied, I'm looking for my brothers.
[185.38 → 187.74] Can you tell me where they are grazing their flocks?
[188.76 → 190.70] They have moved on from here, the man answered.
[190.80 → 192.74] I heard them say, let's go to Dothan.
[193.46 → 196.44] So Joseph went after his brothers and found them near Dothan.
[197.12 → 201.88] But they saw him in the distance, and before he reached them, they plotted to kill him.
[202.38 → 205.02] Here comes that dreamer, they said to each other.
[205.26 → 208.36] Come now, let's kill him and throw him into one of these cisterns
[208.36 → 210.86] and say that a ferocious animal devoured him.
[211.12 → 213.06] Then we'll see what comes of his dreams.
[214.64 → 217.28] When Reuben heard this, he tried to rescue him from their hands.
[217.52 → 219.04] Let's not take his life, he said.
[219.18 → 220.44] Don't shed any blood.
[220.88 → 224.78] Throw him into the cistern here in the wilderness, but don't lay a hand on him.
[225.64 → 229.38] Reuben said this to rescue him from them and take him back to his father.
[229.38 → 235.60] So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped them of his robe, the ornate robe he was wearing,
[235.80 → 238.06] and they took him, and they threw him into the cistern.
[238.26 → 241.06] The cistern was empty, there was no water in it.
[241.60 → 247.28] As they sat down to eat their meal, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead.
[247.76 → 253.66] Their camels were loaded with spices, balm, and myrrh, and they were on their way to take them down to Egypt.
[253.66 → 259.86] Judah said to his brothers, what will we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood?
[260.90 → 264.74] Come, let's sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him.
[264.78 → 267.86] After all, he is our brother, our own flesh and blood.
[268.68 → 269.72] His brothers agreed.
[270.52 → 274.48] So when the Mediaite merchants came by, his brothers pulled Joseph up out of the cistern
[274.48 → 279.44] and sold him for 20 shekels of silver to the Ishmaelites who took him to Egypt.
[280.04 → 283.48] When Reuben returned to the cistern and saw that Joseph was not there,
[283.66 → 286.68] he tore his clothes, he went back to his brothers and said,
[286.92 → 290.06] the boy isn't there, where can I turn now?
[291.28 → 295.66] Then they got Joseph's robe, they slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood.
[296.04 → 298.68] They took the ornate robe back to the father and said,
[299.34 → 304.28] we found this, examine it to see whether it is your son's robe.
[304.66 → 308.98] He recognized it and said, it is my son's robe.
[309.36 → 312.20] Some ferocious animal has devoured him.
[312.20 → 315.06] Joseph has surely been torn to pieces.
[316.46 → 323.18] Then Jacob tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and mourned for his son many days.
[323.96 → 328.76] All his sons and daughters came to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted.
[329.40 → 334.84] No, he said, I will continue to mourn until I join my son in the grave.
[334.84 → 337.24] So his father wept for him.
[338.68 → 345.58] Meanwhile, meanwhile, the Mediates sold Joseph in Egypt to Rotifer,
[346.22 → 350.02] one of Pharaoh's officials, the captain of the guard.
[350.74 → 352.60] This is the word of the Lord.
[352.60 → 364.22] Soon after my dad retired from the ministry, he wrote a book entitled On the Move, The Cloister Story.
[364.40 → 369.62] It became an instant bestseller, as you can imagine, at least in our family.
[369.62 → 375.18] It is a genealogy, actually, of our family, along with commentary.
[376.44 → 381.86] Lots of stories describing how our family came to be as it is today.
[382.92 → 388.18] One of my favourite stories is the one about how we ended up in Canada,
[388.18 → 395.16] a move which obviously profoundly affected my life and for which I've always been so grateful.
[395.98 → 396.98] Well, here's how it happened.
[397.80 → 403.30] It was the spring of 1960, and the Christian Reformed Church of Clinton, Ontario,
[403.74 → 406.56] had been without a pastor for a long time.
[406.56 → 412.32] But they had come up with a slate of two persons for the congregation to vote on.
[413.12 → 417.66] One was Reverend Louis Jamming from Smothers, B.C.
[418.18 → 420.88] The other was my father from the Netherlands.
[422.20 → 425.36] Well, after a lengthy debate about the merits of both pastors,
[425.72 → 430.18] the congregation's sentiments were clearly leaning towards Reverend Jamming,
[430.82 → 435.66] mostly because the younger people, who had already been in Canada for ten years,
[435.66 → 440.58] were concerned that that other candidate might be a little bit too Dutch.
[442.42 → 445.24] The discussion came to an abrupt end
[445.24 → 449.04] when one of the older brothers stood up and asked,
[449.94 → 450.48] Mr. Chairman,
[451.52 → 457.48] what would it cost us to get Reverend Jamming here all the way from Smothers?
[459.08 → 462.44] Well, that would be about $2,000, the chairman said.
[463.56 → 466.54] And Mr. Chairman, continued the older brother,
[466.78 → 472.22] what would it cost us to bring Reverend Sister to Clinton all the way from Holland?
[472.22 → 475.04] The chairman answered,
[475.04 → 479.28] well, that, since the present policy of the Dutch government
[479.28 → 483.12] is to pay the full cost of moving immigrants to Canada,
[483.62 → 485.94] that brother will cost us nothing.
[487.64 → 490.80] The elder brother stood up one more time and said,
[491.14 → 492.92] Mr. Chairman, I call the question.
[494.52 → 495.74] And here I am.
[495.74 → 499.38] And if you ask me,
[499.56 → 502.82] that cheap, sorry, I mean that thrifty Dutchman
[502.82 → 506.44] had God's fingerprints all over him.
[508.64 → 512.08] My dad's book is full of other such stories,
[512.20 → 515.02] stories that look back and reveal patterns
[515.02 → 516.88] of what our family recognizes
[516.88 → 520.80] as God's providence in our lives.
[520.80 → 523.76] God's leading and care,
[523.90 → 525.40] God's fingerprints,
[525.96 → 527.64] evident in sometimes ordinary,
[528.30 → 529.44] sometimes humorous,
[529.52 → 530.42] sometimes sad,
[530.80 → 533.46] sometimes obvious,
[533.86 → 535.72] sometimes fleeting ways.
[537.00 → 539.22] And I suspect that all of you,
[540.00 → 543.30] looking back over your own life up to this point,
[544.04 → 546.48] could find those same fingerprints.
[546.48 → 550.78] It is one of the major themes
[550.78 → 553.90] that ties together the Joseph story
[553.90 → 556.26] told over the last 14 chapters
[556.26 → 557.90] of the Book of Genesis.
[559.66 → 562.46] Mind you, I call it the Joseph story,
[562.92 → 565.16] but it isn't just about Joseph.
[565.92 → 568.72] It is part of a bigger picture that began
[568.72 → 570.60] when God called Abraham,
[570.98 → 572.54] the father of all believers,
[572.90 → 574.72] and promised that in him,
[574.72 → 577.92] he would bless all the families of the earth.
[579.34 → 581.10] And throughout the Book of Genesis,
[581.34 → 582.74] God's promise to Abraham
[582.74 → 585.78] gets narrowed down as you go along.
[586.14 → 587.76] Abraham has two sons,
[588.12 → 589.92] but God's promise of blessing,
[590.34 → 593.16] contrary to accepted custom and tradition,
[593.96 → 595.62] comes to the younger son Isaac
[595.62 → 598.48] instead of the elder Ishmael.
[599.62 → 601.16] Isaac has two sons,
[601.16 → 603.58] but God's promise of blessing again
[603.58 → 605.68] comes to the younger son Jacob
[605.68 → 608.50] rather than the elder Esau.
[610.00 → 612.30] And so the Joseph story begins
[612.30 → 615.32] in Genesis 37 with these words,
[616.58 → 617.82] Jacob lived in the land
[617.82 → 619.32] where his father had stayed,
[619.66 → 620.66] the land of Canaan.
[620.96 → 623.72] This is the account of Jacob.
[623.72 → 628.74] Jacob has 12 sons.
[630.28 → 631.34] And of these 12,
[631.76 → 635.38] Joseph is definitely the star of this story.
[636.64 → 640.64] But it is a story about a whole family in crisis
[640.64 → 644.24] and how all the members of this family
[644.24 → 647.86] are transformed and changed over time.
[647.86 → 653.82] It is also more than a history of one family.
[655.02 → 658.02] Even though God's name is never mentioned
[658.02 → 660.06] in this first chapter of the story,
[660.68 → 661.34] did you notice that?
[662.38 → 664.90] And only very sparingly in the rest,
[666.16 → 667.92] the last chapter in Genesis
[667.92 → 669.94] makes it absolutely clear
[669.94 → 673.70] that this is a story about our God.
[673.70 → 677.32] And if you know anything about the story,
[677.42 → 678.48] even up to this point,
[678.78 → 680.60] younger sons chosen over the elder,
[680.98 → 681.80] meaningful dreams,
[682.20 → 683.10] family squabbles,
[683.44 → 685.44] flawed characters as chosen people,
[685.72 → 687.42] you know that God's fingerprints
[687.42 → 688.86] are all over it.
[689.74 → 692.36] This is the story about God's loving
[692.36 → 694.96] and saving purposes in history.
[695.24 → 696.98] And so it is our story too.
[696.98 → 703.26] And the mystery of how God's purposes intersect
[703.26 → 706.90] with ordinary, messy people,
[707.68 → 710.70] even people like you and like me.
[712.62 → 715.30] What we find in Genesis 37
[715.30 → 718.42] is what we nowadays kindly refer to
[718.42 → 721.00] as a blended family.
[721.64 → 724.18] Although this one has been through the blender
[724.18 → 725.90] a few more times than most.
[726.98 → 728.06] Think of it.
[728.38 → 729.72] Jacob has 12 sons
[729.72 → 733.46] by four different mothers.
[734.40 → 735.64] Two of them his wives,
[735.86 → 737.72] two of them his wives' nannies.
[739.44 → 740.64] And of all these sons,
[740.82 → 743.04] Jacob loves Joseph the best.
[743.88 → 745.98] Joseph means added.
[747.32 → 749.82] Added to Jacob's family unexpectedly
[749.82 → 753.08] because Rachel, his best-loved wife,
[753.12 → 753.90] now dead,
[753.90 → 756.00] had been childish so long
[756.00 → 758.56] before Joseph was finally conceived.
[760.04 → 760.64] Added,
[761.44 → 762.80] if ye ask his brothers,
[763.20 → 765.30] as an unwelcome afterthought.
[766.66 → 769.28] For while Joseph is destined like greatness,
[769.78 → 770.80] like other great men,
[770.86 → 773.30] he could also be in insufferable pain
[773.30 → 775.18] in a variety of places.
[776.46 → 778.50] The very first thing you hear
[778.50 → 780.70] about the now 17-year-old Joseph
[780.70 → 782.92] is that he tattles on his brothers.
[784.00 → 785.14] He brought their father
[785.14 → 787.20] a bad report about them.
[787.56 → 788.56] Now, I can remember
[788.56 → 790.34] wanting to sell one of my siblings
[790.34 → 791.52] into slavery for less.
[793.52 → 796.28] Then, there's that dream coat of his,
[796.96 → 798.32] which most scholars agree
[798.32 → 799.62] was a long-sleeved,
[800.02 → 801.90] intricately designed coat
[801.90 → 803.28] befitting royalty.
[803.28 → 806.16] Not a coat that is meant
[806.16 → 807.90] for work of the sort
[807.90 → 810.34] Joseph's brothers were expected to do.
[811.58 → 813.08] Oh, he might have swept the porch
[813.08 → 814.64] for his dad once in a while,
[814.84 → 817.62] but mostly Joseph never got his hands dirty
[817.62 → 818.76] and seemed to serve
[818.76 → 821.14] only as dad's agent or messenger.
[824.24 → 826.02] Jacob, of course,
[826.10 → 828.32] is neither the first nor the last parent
[828.32 → 830.62] to have a favoured child.
[830.62 → 834.20] wise parents, however,
[834.96 → 837.50] try very hard not to show it.
[839.28 → 841.48] Jacob was not so wise,
[842.48 → 844.26] which created exactly
[844.26 → 846.52] the kind of sibling rivalry
[846.52 → 848.42] you would expect.
[848.88 → 850.68] His brother, says our story,
[851.40 → 852.62] hated Joseph,
[853.40 → 857.36] could not speak one kind word to him.
[857.36 → 861.06] And it's hard to blame them.
[862.74 → 863.94] Then come the dreams.
[864.40 → 865.58] Not the silly kind of dreams
[865.58 → 867.20] we remember hazily, if at all,
[867.36 → 868.64] when we wake up in the morning,
[868.68 → 869.64] and if we do remember them,
[869.68 → 870.44] we don't have a clue
[870.44 → 871.36] what they might have meant.
[872.36 → 874.48] No, these dreams mean something.
[875.00 → 876.28] These dreams are all about
[876.28 → 877.70] how Joseph will turn out
[877.70 → 879.14] to be greater than his brothers,
[879.28 → 880.90] greater even than his father.
[881.34 → 882.74] And there is no question,
[882.94 → 885.24] both for those who first heard this story
[885.24 → 886.94] and we who read it today,
[887.24 → 889.60] that these dreams came from God,
[889.76 → 891.00] that in these dreams
[891.00 → 892.64] we are meant to sense something
[892.64 → 894.78] of God's plan and purposes,
[895.64 → 897.32] that Joseph is special,
[897.42 → 898.90] whether his brothers like it or not,
[899.40 → 901.52] and that he will do great things
[901.52 → 902.60] with his life,
[902.72 → 903.92] and that in itself
[903.92 → 905.40] is not the problem.
[907.58 → 909.24] It is how Joseph interprets
[909.76 → 911.90] and uses these dreams.
[911.90 → 914.88] He describes them to his family
[914.88 → 917.72] with an air of self-importance,
[917.80 → 920.30] finding a sort of perverse pleasure
[920.30 → 922.08] at the picture of his family
[922.08 → 923.98] bowing before him.
[924.20 → 927.82] And he ends up interpreting
[927.82 → 930.60] the dreams with himself
[930.60 → 934.52] rather than God at the centre.
[936.56 → 938.12] Joseph was certainly old enough
[938.12 → 939.20] to know it would be better
[939.20 → 940.50] to keep his dreams to himself.
[940.50 → 944.88] But obviously not mature enough.
[946.32 → 947.10] And so it happens
[947.10 → 948.40] that at breakfast one day,
[948.52 → 949.32] as they're all munching
[949.32 → 950.58] on their bagels and lox,
[951.26 → 952.52] he spills out his dream
[952.52 → 953.32] about his brothers
[953.32 → 954.70] bowing down before him.
[955.22 → 956.32] As you can imagine,
[956.80 → 958.90] this doesn't go over real well.
[960.16 → 961.84] But that does not deter Joseph.
[962.86 → 963.80] A few mornings later,
[963.86 → 964.88] he causes his brothers
[964.88 → 966.12] to spit out their goat's milk
[966.12 → 967.22] by telling the same story
[967.22 → 968.02] all over again.
[968.02 → 969.16] Only this time,
[969.24 → 970.52] the imagery has changed
[970.52 → 971.84] from sheaves of wheat
[971.84 → 973.20] to the sun and moon
[973.20 → 974.42] and eleven stars
[974.42 → 975.82] bowing down to him.
[976.28 → 978.02] Which is when even Father Jacob
[978.02 → 979.32] cannot resist the urge
[979.32 → 981.78] to actually rebuke Joseph.
[982.88 → 984.66] He loved Joseph and all.
[985.34 → 986.30] But enough was enough.
[986.54 → 987.38] Talk like this
[987.38 → 988.86] was only going to lead
[988.86 → 989.82] to something bad.
[989.82 → 990.98] And while we read
[990.98 → 991.74] that his father
[991.74 → 993.36] kept the matter in mind,
[993.80 → 994.58] after all,
[995.08 → 996.84] Jacob knew the power of dreams.
[997.10 → 998.40] Remember Jacob's ladder.
[999.52 → 1000.66] You get the impression
[1000.66 → 1002.28] that Jacob was finally
[1002.28 → 1003.54] beginning to see
[1003.54 → 1004.72] what this was doing
[1004.72 → 1006.08] to Joseph's brothers.
[1007.54 → 1009.02] Our translation says
[1009.02 → 1010.40] they were jealous.
[1011.26 → 1012.70] Technically, of course,
[1012.96 → 1014.60] they were envious.
[1014.60 → 1016.86] You are jealous
[1016.86 → 1018.12] of what is yours.
[1019.38 → 1020.28] You envy
[1020.28 → 1022.06] what somebody else has.
[1023.56 → 1024.84] And envy easily
[1024.84 → 1026.56] becomes both dangerous
[1026.56 → 1027.92] and deadly.
[1029.30 → 1030.74] Envy can churn away
[1030.74 → 1031.66] inside of you
[1031.66 → 1032.98] like psychic heartburn
[1032.98 → 1033.72] and making you
[1033.72 → 1035.26] want to destroy the one
[1035.26 → 1037.58] who has what you don't.
[1037.58 → 1041.54] And so Jacob's home
[1041.54 → 1042.80] became a time bomb
[1042.80 → 1044.66] waiting to explode.
[1045.62 → 1047.08] But life went on
[1047.08 → 1048.38] until one day
[1048.38 → 1049.64] Joseph's brothers
[1049.64 → 1050.28] were grazing
[1050.28 → 1051.28] dad's flocks
[1051.28 → 1052.22] near Shechem
[1052.22 → 1054.34] and Jacob decides
[1054.34 → 1055.26] to send Joseph
[1055.26 → 1056.60] to check on them,
[1056.88 → 1057.54] though it sounds
[1057.54 → 1059.28] more like a spying mission.
[1061.30 → 1062.70] And that brings us
[1062.70 → 1064.26] to a part of the story
[1064.26 → 1065.28] that seems completely
[1065.80 → 1066.54] unnecessary
[1066.54 → 1067.58] to the plot
[1067.58 → 1068.76] now unfolding,
[1069.14 → 1070.10] making it easy
[1070.10 → 1071.38] to skim over
[1071.38 → 1074.02] about how Joseph
[1074.02 → 1075.58] does not find
[1075.58 → 1076.06] the brothers
[1076.06 → 1076.62] at Shechem
[1076.62 → 1077.48] as expected,
[1077.88 → 1078.86] but happens
[1078.86 → 1079.62] to run into
[1079.62 → 1080.40] a stranger
[1080.40 → 1081.86] who in fact
[1081.86 → 1083.22] finds him,
[1084.32 → 1084.96] a stranger
[1084.96 → 1086.94] who somehow
[1086.94 → 1088.36] overheard the brothers
[1088.36 → 1089.28] and knows
[1089.28 → 1090.30] they had moved
[1090.30 → 1091.38] on to Dothan
[1091.38 → 1092.12] an additional
[1092.12 → 1093.76] 30 kilometres away.
[1095.30 → 1095.62] Well,
[1095.62 → 1096.72] Shechem,
[1097.08 → 1097.48] Dothan,
[1097.72 → 1099.18] who really cares,
[1099.30 → 1099.60] right?
[1101.22 → 1102.34] But in the Bible
[1102.34 → 1103.68] it is always important
[1103.68 → 1105.02] to sweat the small stuff,
[1105.72 → 1107.60] to pay attention
[1107.60 → 1108.40] to seemingly
[1108.40 → 1109.94] unnecessary details,
[1110.22 → 1112.02] because sometimes
[1112.02 → 1112.66] that's where
[1112.66 → 1113.66] the deepest meaning
[1113.66 → 1114.44] of the story
[1114.44 → 1115.62] gets exposed.
[1115.98 → 1116.24] I mean,
[1116.28 → 1117.12] it's remarkable
[1117.12 → 1118.58] if you think about it.
[1118.62 → 1119.28] A stranger
[1119.28 → 1120.40] just happens
[1120.40 → 1122.02] to find Joseph
[1122.02 → 1123.62] just happen
[1123.62 → 1125.24] to overhear a conversation.
[1128.24 → 1129.28] Without what
[1129.28 → 1130.10] we might call
[1130.10 → 1131.90] this chance encounter,
[1133.52 → 1134.54] Joseph would not
[1134.54 → 1135.48] have found his brothers,
[1136.62 → 1137.88] would not have been there
[1137.88 → 1139.20] at the precise time
[1139.20 → 1140.26] a trading caravan
[1140.26 → 1141.02] of Mediates
[1141.02 → 1141.76] passed by,
[1142.30 → 1144.04] would not have ended up
[1144.04 → 1145.12] on his long tour
[1145.12 → 1146.38] of duty in Egypt,
[1146.88 → 1147.72] thereby saving
[1147.72 → 1149.24] not only his own people,
[1149.58 → 1150.96] but also the Egyptians
[1150.96 → 1153.00] and many others.
[1153.18 → 1154.66] Without that chance
[1154.66 → 1155.42] encounter,
[1156.48 → 1157.44] Joseph would likely
[1157.44 → 1158.20] have gone back
[1158.20 → 1158.92] to his father
[1158.92 → 1160.32] with another bad report,
[1160.66 → 1161.66] my brothers were not
[1161.66 → 1162.24] where they said
[1162.24 → 1163.10] they would be.
[1163.10 → 1166.40] And that would have been
[1166.40 → 1167.20] that.
[1169.66 → 1170.54] Makes you wonder
[1170.54 → 1172.42] who the stranger
[1172.42 → 1174.24] really was.
[1176.94 → 1177.84] In any case,
[1177.96 → 1178.62] Joseph finally
[1178.62 → 1179.44] finds his brothers
[1179.44 → 1180.58] and already from a distance
[1180.58 → 1181.46] they recognize him,
[1181.54 → 1182.68] probably from the way
[1182.68 → 1183.82] his coat was building
[1183.82 → 1185.04] in the wind behind him,
[1186.10 → 1186.86] the dreamer,
[1187.00 → 1187.52] they call him.
[1187.60 → 1189.08] Here comes that dreamer.
[1190.50 → 1191.16] And their hate
[1191.16 → 1191.76] and their envy
[1191.76 → 1192.70] is so raw,
[1192.70 → 1193.42] it takes only
[1193.42 → 1194.14] the few minutes
[1194.14 → 1195.20] for him to reach them
[1195.20 → 1196.66] that the plot is hatched.
[1196.72 → 1197.46] Let's kill him,
[1197.62 → 1198.06] they say.
[1199.20 → 1200.12] No, no, no,
[1200.14 → 1201.18] says the oldest brother Reuben.
[1201.72 → 1202.68] Let's just dump him
[1202.68 → 1203.46] in a pit for now,
[1203.56 → 1204.80] thinking to rescue him later.
[1206.34 → 1207.12] And before Joseph
[1207.12 → 1208.20] knows that he's in a pit,
[1208.50 → 1209.56] minus his royal robe,
[1209.78 → 1210.50] while his brothers,
[1210.72 → 1211.46] minus Reuben,
[1211.66 → 1212.24] who is off
[1212.24 → 1213.02] checking the flocks,
[1213.34 → 1213.96] enjoy a meal
[1213.96 → 1214.60] just like a bunch
[1214.60 → 1215.32] of mobsters
[1215.32 → 1216.62] returning to their spaghetti
[1216.62 → 1218.06] after they've erased somebody.
[1218.96 → 1220.08] Taking care of business,
[1220.56 → 1221.14] that's all.
[1222.70 → 1224.60] That's when the Mediates
[1224.60 → 1225.26] come along
[1225.26 → 1226.42] and Judah,
[1226.76 → 1227.60] one of the brothers
[1227.60 → 1228.32] to watch
[1228.32 → 1229.78] in this story,
[1230.28 → 1231.84] gets the idea
[1231.84 → 1232.78] to sell Joseph.
[1233.80 → 1234.82] And before you know it,
[1235.06 → 1235.28] Joseph
[1235.28 → 1236.58] is on his way
[1236.58 → 1237.46] to Egypt.
[1238.50 → 1239.62] In his novel
[1239.62 → 1240.24] on Jacob,
[1241.00 → 1241.84] Son of Laughter,
[1242.68 → 1243.38] Frederick Becker
[1243.38 → 1244.16] imagines
[1244.16 → 1245.58] how the transaction
[1245.58 → 1246.38] took place.
[1246.48 → 1246.92] The traders
[1246.92 → 1247.74] inspecting
[1247.74 → 1248.58] Joseph
[1248.58 → 1249.36] like a horse
[1249.36 → 1250.12] at an auction,
[1250.50 → 1251.44] pinching his muscles,
[1251.80 → 1252.84] prying his mouth open
[1252.84 → 1254.02] to look at his teeth,
[1254.26 → 1254.78] then offering
[1254.78 → 1255.74] five silver bits
[1255.74 → 1256.18] for him.
[1256.44 → 1257.06] When their brothers
[1257.06 → 1257.96] insist on thirty,
[1258.04 → 1258.98] they up it to ten,
[1259.42 → 1260.24] then to fifteen
[1260.24 → 1260.96] if a good knife
[1260.96 → 1261.74] comes with a deal,
[1261.82 → 1262.60] then to seventeen,
[1262.88 → 1263.64] one for each year
[1263.64 → 1264.16] of his age,
[1264.20 → 1264.62] and finally
[1264.62 → 1265.28] they all agree
[1265.28 → 1266.12] on twenty bits
[1266.12 → 1266.62] of silver,
[1266.94 → 1267.40] the price
[1267.40 → 1268.22] of a brother.
[1270.70 → 1271.74] We are not told
[1271.74 → 1272.14] here
[1272.14 → 1273.60] if Joseph cried
[1273.60 → 1274.72] or pleaded
[1274.72 → 1275.20] with him.
[1277.56 → 1278.62] He did all
[1278.62 → 1279.02] of that
[1279.02 → 1279.86] and more
[1279.86 → 1281.44] as we learn
[1281.44 → 1281.76] later.
[1282.62 → 1283.66] But the dreams
[1283.66 → 1284.82] have long ago
[1284.82 → 1285.32] hardened
[1285.32 → 1286.76] his brother's hearts.
[1287.44 → 1287.94] There would be
[1287.94 → 1288.64] no sympathy,
[1289.24 → 1290.34] no compassion.
[1291.30 → 1291.58] Joseph,
[1292.04 → 1292.84] like another
[1292.84 → 1293.78] beloved son,
[1294.26 → 1294.86] much later
[1294.86 → 1296.24] in his story
[1296.24 → 1297.84] is betrayed
[1297.84 → 1298.76] for a few pieces
[1298.76 → 1299.32] of silver.
[1300.10 → 1300.98] And as the caravan
[1300.98 → 1301.50] moves off,
[1301.56 → 1302.24] one imagines
[1302.24 → 1302.74] the brothers
[1302.74 → 1303.50] taunting him
[1303.50 → 1304.62] with exaggerated
[1304.62 → 1305.06] bows.
[1305.20 → 1305.46] So,
[1305.62 → 1306.32] little bro,
[1306.72 → 1307.30] dreamer,
[1307.58 → 1308.34] what happens
[1308.34 → 1309.08] to your dreams
[1309.08 → 1309.58] now?
[1313.08 → 1313.90] This part
[1313.90 → 1314.36] of the story
[1314.36 → 1314.84] ends
[1314.84 → 1315.92] when the scheming
[1315.92 → 1316.52] brothers bring
[1316.52 → 1317.02] their father
[1317.02 → 1318.28] Joseph's dream coat,
[1318.76 → 1319.70] now mostly blood
[1319.70 → 1320.50] red in colour,
[1321.08 → 1321.94] the blood of a goat,
[1322.06 → 1322.80] and convince him
[1322.80 → 1324.36] that his son,
[1324.66 → 1325.06] note,
[1325.50 → 1326.20] they don't say
[1326.20 → 1326.94] our brother,
[1327.26 → 1328.62] but his son
[1328.62 → 1329.88] is missing
[1329.88 → 1330.70] in action.
[1331.60 → 1332.12] Certainly
[1332.12 → 1332.68] almost
[1332.68 → 1334.30] killed by a wild
[1334.30 → 1334.72] animal,
[1335.62 → 1336.14] and Jacob,
[1336.64 → 1337.64] and only Jacob,
[1337.98 → 1338.48] is left
[1338.48 → 1339.20] weeping
[1339.20 → 1340.30] in a grief
[1340.30 → 1341.46] which,
[1341.68 → 1342.44] with no dead
[1342.44 → 1343.24] body to bring
[1343.24 → 1344.22] any sort of closure,
[1344.76 → 1345.56] goes on
[1345.56 → 1346.50] and on
[1346.50 → 1347.66] and on.
[1350.16 → 1351.26] What a story.
[1352.54 → 1353.78] The classic
[1353.78 → 1355.04] blended family
[1355.04 → 1356.32] in which
[1356.32 → 1356.82] everything
[1356.82 → 1357.74] goes wrong,
[1358.44 → 1359.10] favouritism,
[1359.70 → 1360.12] spying,
[1360.12 → 1361.20] tattletale,
[1361.64 → 1362.54] sibling rivalry,
[1363.18 → 1363.52] hatred,
[1363.82 → 1364.12] envy,
[1364.50 → 1364.90] strife,
[1365.34 → 1366.28] murder schemes,
[1366.50 → 1366.82] greed,
[1367.06 → 1367.50] violence,
[1367.64 → 1368.02] deceit,
[1368.12 → 1368.62] and grief
[1368.62 → 1370.40] that refuses comfort.
[1371.54 → 1372.76] Unlike the musical
[1372.76 → 1374.22] Joseph and the Amazing
[1374.22 → 1375.52] Technicolor Dreamboat,
[1375.62 → 1376.32] as much fun
[1376.32 → 1377.40] as it was
[1377.40 → 1378.02] and is,
[1379.10 → 1379.96] there's not much
[1379.96 → 1380.44] in the way
[1380.44 → 1381.10] of laughter
[1381.10 → 1382.32] and dancing
[1382.32 → 1383.36] and singing
[1383.36 → 1384.50] here.
[1384.50 → 1387.56] you wonder,
[1388.18 → 1390.40] where is God
[1390.40 → 1391.34] in all this?
[1393.38 → 1394.14] The question
[1394.14 → 1395.28] we still ask
[1395.28 → 1395.68] today,
[1395.76 → 1396.14] isn't it?
[1397.12 → 1398.00] When we look
[1398.00 → 1399.00] around at the evil
[1399.00 → 1399.78] and heartbreak
[1399.78 → 1400.54] in our world,
[1400.62 → 1401.64] when we look
[1401.64 → 1402.30] at the way
[1402.30 → 1403.26] these days
[1403.26 → 1403.72] our world
[1403.72 → 1404.30] has been turned
[1404.30 → 1405.42] upside down
[1405.42 → 1406.60] by a simple
[1406.60 → 1407.34] virus,
[1407.34 → 1409.90] when we look
[1409.90 → 1410.70] at the brokenness
[1410.70 → 1411.36] we ourselves
[1411.36 → 1412.12] experience
[1412.12 → 1413.38] in our lives
[1413.38 → 1414.22] or in our families,
[1414.58 → 1416.02] where is God
[1416.02 → 1417.60] in all this?
[1421.00 → 1422.00] Sometimes we talk
[1422.00 → 1422.74] easily about
[1422.74 → 1423.58] God's providence,
[1423.68 → 1424.38] mostly when good
[1424.38 → 1424.94] things happen,
[1425.02 → 1425.68] like a thrifty
[1425.68 → 1426.46] Dutchman standing
[1426.46 → 1426.92] up at a
[1426.92 → 1427.70] congregational meeting
[1427.70 → 1428.36] to call for the
[1428.36 → 1428.76] question,
[1429.46 → 1429.82] yes.
[1431.92 → 1432.94] It's great to talk
[1432.94 → 1433.60] about providence
[1433.60 → 1434.42] when you get the job
[1434.42 → 1435.16] you prayed for
[1435.16 → 1436.02] or you meet
[1436.02 → 1437.74] Mr. or Miss Wright
[1437.74 → 1438.46] at just a proper
[1438.46 → 1439.32] time in your life
[1439.32 → 1440.44] or you narrowly
[1440.44 → 1440.90] escaped,
[1441.00 → 1441.88] as you recounted
[1441.88 → 1442.76] in your prayer,
[1443.06 → 1444.08] a terrible accident
[1444.08 → 1445.78] or you experience
[1445.78 → 1446.78] any of the countless
[1446.78 → 1448.22] big or small ways
[1448.22 → 1450.60] by which the strong
[1450.60 → 1452.90] but sure hands
[1452.90 → 1454.54] of the Heavenly Father
[1454.54 → 1457.16] uphold and care
[1457.16 → 1457.94] for our world
[1457.94 → 1460.18] and your life.
[1460.18 → 1464.88] But when bad
[1464.88 → 1465.68] things come along,
[1466.46 → 1467.60] we begin to wonder,
[1468.38 → 1470.10] where was God?
[1472.00 → 1473.40] Because God's providence
[1473.40 → 1474.66] is not all sweetness
[1474.66 → 1475.82] and happiness.
[1476.10 → 1476.76] One of the things
[1476.76 → 1477.60] Genesis 7
[1477.60 → 1478.66] and the Joseph cycle
[1478.66 → 1479.16] of stories
[1479.16 → 1480.26] have to teach us
[1480.26 → 1481.30] is that there is more
[1481.30 → 1482.74] to God's providence
[1482.74 → 1483.72] than that.
[1485.02 → 1485.62] Sometimes
[1485.62 → 1486.94] the world
[1486.94 → 1487.64] resists
[1487.64 → 1488.44] God's work.
[1488.44 → 1490.68] sometimes
[1490.68 → 1491.80] God's own children
[1491.80 → 1492.90] including you and I
[1492.90 → 1494.86] resist His work
[1494.86 → 1496.12] and His word.
[1497.52 → 1498.64] Because of the sin
[1498.64 → 1499.34] and brokenness
[1499.34 → 1500.18] of our lives
[1500.18 → 1500.84] and the world,
[1501.00 → 1501.72] sometimes it is
[1501.72 → 1503.06] God's work itself
[1503.06 → 1504.04] that can bring us
[1504.04 → 1504.86] unhappiness.
[1507.12 → 1508.20] At other times,
[1508.30 → 1509.30] God does this work
[1509.30 → 1509.84] in the midst
[1509.84 → 1510.86] of some of the worst
[1510.86 → 1511.96] things life can dish
[1511.96 → 1512.60] out to you.
[1513.90 → 1515.06] God did not inspire
[1515.06 → 1515.94] the evil plot
[1515.94 → 1517.28] of Joseph's brothers,
[1517.28 → 1517.40] brothers,
[1518.20 → 1519.04] but that doesn't mean
[1519.04 → 1519.92] He cannot bring good
[1519.92 → 1520.44] out of it,
[1520.88 → 1522.02] that He cannot fulfill
[1522.02 → 1522.66] His purposes
[1522.66 → 1523.74] in spite of it.
[1525.34 → 1526.20] A certain
[1526.20 → 1527.66] Jewish rabbi
[1527.66 → 1528.56] trying to explain
[1528.56 → 1529.04] all this
[1529.04 → 1530.22] writes about
[1530.22 → 1530.80] the following
[1530.80 → 1531.52] conversation
[1531.52 → 1532.56] between a rabbi
[1532.56 → 1533.64] and his student.
[1534.84 → 1535.40] Rabbi,
[1536.52 → 1537.72] do you know
[1537.72 → 1538.26] why Satan
[1538.26 → 1539.02] is so angry
[1539.02 → 1539.96] all the time?
[1539.96 → 1541.68] because whenever
[1541.68 → 1542.34] he works
[1542.34 → 1543.24] a particularly
[1543.24 → 1544.08] clever bit
[1544.08 → 1544.72] of mischief,
[1545.54 → 1546.56] God uses it
[1546.56 → 1547.16] to serve
[1547.16 → 1547.86] His own
[1547.86 → 1549.34] righteous purposes.
[1550.52 → 1551.08] Student,
[1551.92 → 1552.18] so,
[1552.96 → 1553.82] God uses
[1553.82 → 1554.66] wicked people
[1554.66 → 1555.36] as His tools?
[1557.16 → 1557.52] Rabbi,
[1558.30 → 1559.30] God gives us
[1559.30 → 1560.06] freedom to do
[1560.06 → 1560.72] a great deal
[1560.72 → 1561.20] of evil
[1561.20 → 1562.44] if we choose.
[1563.20 → 1563.58] Then,
[1564.10 → 1564.84] He uses
[1564.84 → 1565.58] His own freedom
[1565.58 → 1566.46] to create goodness
[1566.46 → 1567.16] out of that evil
[1567.16 → 1567.94] for that is what
[1567.94 → 1568.78] He chooses.
[1568.78 → 1570.56] student.
[1571.38 → 1571.58] So,
[1571.90 → 1572.90] in the long run,
[1573.72 → 1575.42] God always wins.
[1576.34 → 1576.58] Rabbi,
[1577.54 → 1578.12] yes.
[1579.00 → 1580.28] But in the short run,
[1581.14 → 1582.12] it can be
[1582.12 → 1584.28] very uncomfortable.
[1587.10 → 1588.68] And if you doubt that,
[1589.20 → 1590.24] don't just ask
[1590.24 → 1591.28] Jacob's son,
[1591.98 → 1592.90] ask God's
[1592.90 → 1593.78] own
[1593.78 → 1595.14] beloved son.
[1596.26 → 1597.06] Ask Jesus.
[1598.78 → 1599.86] In the short run,
[1600.26 → 1600.96] we can make
[1600.96 → 1601.64] such a mess
[1601.64 → 1602.40] of our lives.
[1603.44 → 1604.38] In the short run,
[1604.90 → 1605.56] human history
[1605.56 → 1606.64] often looks
[1606.64 → 1607.14] more like
[1607.14 → 1608.02] a train wreck
[1608.02 → 1609.44] than the unfolding
[1609.44 → 1610.02] purposes
[1610.02 → 1611.04] of God.
[1612.24 → 1613.22] God does not
[1613.22 → 1613.94] guarantee us
[1613.94 → 1614.66] the ability
[1614.66 → 1615.64] to see the
[1615.64 → 1616.08] meaningful,
[1616.58 → 1617.62] larger patterns
[1617.62 → 1618.34] of it all
[1618.34 → 1619.76] on this side
[1619.76 → 1620.58] of the grave.
[1621.22 → 1622.08] Any number
[1622.08 → 1622.58] of people
[1622.58 → 1623.20] have lived
[1623.20 → 1624.28] and have died
[1624.28 → 1625.06] without being
[1625.06 → 1625.84] able to look
[1625.84 → 1627.26] back as Joseph
[1627.26 → 1628.16] of one day will
[1628.16 → 1629.02] and declare
[1629.02 → 1630.26] it was all good
[1630.26 → 1631.42] because it was
[1631.42 → 1632.64] all used
[1632.64 → 1633.42] by God.
[1635.34 → 1636.02] Nor do
[1636.02 → 1637.12] Genesis 37
[1637.12 → 1637.78] and the chapters
[1637.78 → 1638.32] that follow
[1638.32 → 1638.90] tell us that
[1638.90 → 1639.64] we'll always know
[1639.64 → 1640.58] the wherefores
[1640.58 → 1641.42] and the why's
[1641.42 → 1642.12] of what's happening
[1642.12 → 1642.68] to us.
[1643.06 → 1643.44] Instead,
[1643.72 → 1644.40] these chapters
[1644.40 → 1644.98] declare
[1644.98 → 1646.90] the sure hope
[1646.90 → 1648.14] that in the longest
[1648.14 → 1649.12] possible run,
[1649.30 → 1650.78] it will make sense.
[1651.28 → 1652.44] God will not be
[1652.44 → 1653.14] outdone,
[1653.64 → 1654.30] outsmarted,
[1654.30 → 1655.28] outwitted,
[1655.64 → 1656.44] not even by
[1656.44 → 1657.06] the world's
[1657.06 → 1658.16] the greatest evil,
[1659.06 → 1659.74] the killing
[1659.74 → 1661.28] of his own son.
[1662.92 → 1663.84] The witness
[1663.84 → 1665.32] of Genesis 37
[1665.32 → 1666.10] to 50
[1666.10 → 1667.64] and all
[1667.64 → 1668.06] scripture
[1668.06 → 1669.24] is that somehow
[1669.24 → 1670.56] God can
[1670.56 → 1671.22] and will
[1671.22 → 1672.28] make all
[1672.28 → 1673.22] things new,
[1674.02 → 1675.24] right every
[1675.24 → 1675.70] wrong,
[1676.12 → 1676.92] and return
[1676.92 → 1678.02] all things
[1678.02 → 1678.88] to how they
[1678.88 → 1679.32] should have
[1679.32 → 1680.98] been all along.
[1680.98 → 1684.46] many scholars
[1684.46 → 1685.16] believe that
[1685.16 → 1686.14] the Joseph story
[1686.14 → 1686.92] was first set
[1686.92 → 1687.80] into written form
[1687.80 → 1688.80] during the time
[1688.80 → 1689.92] of Israel's exile
[1689.92 → 1690.70] in Babylon.
[1691.74 → 1692.52] If so,
[1692.60 → 1693.38] then the original
[1693.38 → 1694.74] audience of Joseph's
[1694.74 → 1695.50] story were people
[1695.50 → 1696.18] well acquainted
[1696.18 → 1696.88] with grief
[1696.88 → 1697.84] and with the
[1697.84 → 1698.64] collapse of what
[1698.64 → 1699.44] were the fondest
[1699.44 → 1700.50] hopes and dreams
[1700.50 → 1701.98] of their faith.
[1703.74 → 1704.70] Even if that
[1704.70 → 1705.34] isn't so,
[1705.68 → 1706.72] certainly this story
[1706.72 → 1707.42] has been read
[1707.42 → 1708.28] by any number
[1708.28 → 1709.04] of Israelites,
[1709.04 → 1711.16] Jews and Christians
[1711.16 → 1712.04] who found
[1712.04 → 1713.00] themselves in
[1713.00 → 1714.06] some measure
[1714.06 → 1714.86] of exile,
[1715.20 → 1715.80] at some
[1715.80 → 1717.00] removed from
[1717.00 → 1717.36] God,
[1717.52 → 1718.10] at some
[1718.10 → 1719.02] crisis point
[1719.02 → 1719.52] of faith.
[1721.10 → 1722.14] In other words,
[1722.26 → 1723.10] it really is
[1723.10 → 1723.68] a story
[1723.68 → 1725.22] for all of us.
[1727.24 → 1728.54] And that story
[1728.54 → 1729.60] does not end
[1729.60 → 1730.46] with the
[1730.46 → 1731.52] inconsolable
[1731.52 → 1732.54] weeping of
[1732.54 → 1733.30] Jacob over
[1733.30 → 1734.18] his apparently
[1734.18 → 1735.44] dead son.
[1736.34 → 1737.24] This story
[1737.24 → 1737.72] we know
[1737.72 → 1738.46] is far
[1738.46 → 1739.08] from over.
[1740.28 → 1741.06] For the author
[1741.06 → 1742.46] of Genesis 37
[1742.46 → 1743.68] has sown
[1743.68 → 1744.26] at least
[1744.26 → 1745.06] three
[1745.06 → 1746.02] seeds
[1746.02 → 1747.00] of hope.
[1748.24 → 1749.16] The first
[1749.16 → 1750.20] is in verse 11
[1750.20 → 1751.36] when Jacob,
[1751.62 → 1752.12] despite having
[1752.12 → 1752.94] just rebuked
[1752.94 → 1753.68] Joseph for his
[1753.68 → 1754.18] arrogance,
[1755.32 → 1756.60] kept the matter
[1756.60 → 1757.70] in mind.
[1759.44 → 1760.16] Jacob,
[1760.38 → 1760.70] that is,
[1760.74 → 1761.36] who has had
[1761.36 → 1762.12] his own share
[1762.12 → 1762.78] of dreams,
[1763.24 → 1764.46] has the nagging
[1764.46 → 1765.12] sense and
[1765.12 → 1765.94] gives us
[1765.94 → 1766.56] the nagging
[1766.56 → 1767.38] sense that
[1767.38 → 1768.34] if he didn't
[1768.34 → 1768.92] already know
[1768.92 → 1769.32] better,
[1769.46 → 1769.82] there is
[1769.82 → 1771.08] something more
[1771.08 → 1771.88] to Joseph's
[1771.88 → 1773.14] dreams than
[1773.14 → 1773.54] a vivid
[1773.54 → 1774.28] imagination
[1774.28 → 1775.60] or wishful
[1775.60 → 1775.96] thinking.
[1778.26 → 1779.18] The second
[1779.18 → 1779.82] seed of hope
[1779.82 → 1780.18] is the
[1780.18 → 1780.94] appearance of
[1780.94 → 1781.68] that stranger.
[1782.56 → 1783.20] In this
[1783.20 → 1783.60] seemingly
[1783.60 → 1784.88] irrelevant detail,
[1785.76 → 1786.30] it is as
[1786.30 → 1786.80] though the
[1786.80 → 1787.60] storyteller
[1787.60 → 1788.34] is whispering,
[1788.34 → 1790.42] look,
[1791.06 → 1791.48] get it?
[1791.58 → 1792.00] There is a
[1792.00 → 1792.94] bigger picture
[1792.94 → 1793.30] here.
[1793.76 → 1794.24] There is a
[1794.24 → 1794.90] bigger purpose
[1794.90 → 1795.28] here.
[1796.40 → 1796.92] Imagine,
[1797.72 → 1798.42] again,
[1798.52 → 1798.88] if this
[1798.88 → 1799.46] stranger had
[1799.46 → 1800.00] not appeared.
[1801.42 → 1801.98] Joseph would
[1801.98 → 1802.46] have returned
[1802.46 → 1803.18] home to his
[1803.18 → 1803.54] father,
[1804.54 → 1805.18] his family,
[1805.84 → 1806.60] and Israel,
[1806.90 → 1807.36] and the line
[1807.36 → 1807.74] from which
[1807.74 → 1808.38] God's Saviour
[1808.38 → 1809.26] Jesus would
[1809.26 → 1809.88] one day come
[1809.88 → 1810.40] would never
[1810.40 → 1810.78] have been
[1810.78 → 1811.28] rescued from
[1811.28 → 1811.66] the great
[1811.66 → 1812.02] famine,
[1812.42 → 1812.96] and God's
[1812.96 → 1813.40] people would
[1813.40 → 1813.80] not have
[1813.80 → 1814.58] ended up as
[1814.58 → 1815.52] slaves in
[1815.52 → 1815.84] Egypt,
[1815.94 → 1816.52] only to be
[1816.52 → 1817.08] delivered by
[1817.08 → 1817.70] Moses hundreds
[1817.70 → 1818.16] of years
[1818.16 → 1818.50] later,
[1818.80 → 1819.62] because the
[1819.62 → 1820.18] stranger
[1820.18 → 1822.04] appears.
[1823.14 → 1823.52] God's
[1823.52 → 1824.06] promise to
[1824.06 → 1824.94] Abraham in
[1824.94 → 1825.90] Genesis 15
[1825.90 → 1826.80] will yet be
[1826.80 → 1827.22] fulfilled,
[1827.52 → 1827.88] namely,
[1828.84 → 1829.36] know for
[1829.36 → 1830.06] certain that
[1830.06 → 1830.92] your descendants
[1830.92 → 1831.62] will be
[1831.62 → 1832.40] strangers in
[1832.40 → 1832.82] a country
[1832.82 → 1833.30] not their
[1833.30 → 1833.62] own,
[1833.84 → 1834.38] and they
[1834.38 → 1834.78] will be
[1834.78 → 1835.92] enslaved and
[1835.92 → 1836.52] mistreated
[1836.52 → 1838.36] 400 years,
[1838.96 → 1839.78] but I will
[1839.78 → 1840.44] punish the
[1840.44 → 1841.40] nation they
[1841.40 → 1842.12] serve as
[1842.12 → 1842.50] slaves,
[1842.58 → 1843.20] and afterward
[1843.20 → 1844.06] they will
[1844.06 → 1844.58] come out
[1844.58 → 1845.44] with great
[1845.44 → 1846.04] possessions.
[1847.08 → 1848.96] It was
[1848.96 → 1849.52] only later
[1849.52 → 1850.18] that Joseph
[1850.18 → 1851.76] would recognize
[1851.76 → 1852.60] this stranger
[1852.60 → 1853.66] as God
[1853.66 → 1854.44] at work,
[1855.40 → 1856.34] God directing
[1856.34 → 1857.06] his path
[1857.06 → 1858.44] towards slavery
[1858.44 → 1859.96] so that one
[1859.96 → 1860.56] day Joseph
[1860.56 → 1861.10] could tell
[1861.10 → 1861.72] his brothers
[1861.72 → 1862.98] you meant
[1862.98 → 1863.60] it for evil
[1863.60 → 1864.38] but God
[1864.38 → 1865.12] meant it
[1865.12 → 1866.02] for good.
[1867.18 → 1868.16] It serves
[1868.16 → 1868.72] to remind
[1868.72 → 1870.88] us that
[1870.88 → 1871.62] just because
[1871.62 → 1872.34] God is
[1872.34 → 1873.34] hidden from
[1873.34 → 1873.88] our view
[1873.88 → 1875.02] does not
[1875.02 → 1876.02] mean he
[1876.02 → 1876.36] is not
[1876.36 → 1876.74] there,
[1877.86 → 1879.26] keeping
[1879.26 → 1880.20] his promises.
[1881.16 → 1881.92] Even when
[1881.92 → 1882.56] God is
[1882.56 → 1883.08] hidden,
[1883.46 → 1883.98] even when
[1883.98 → 1884.48] life goes
[1884.48 → 1885.24] all wrong,
[1885.54 → 1886.04] even when
[1886.04 → 1886.66] God cannot
[1886.66 → 1887.40] be seen,
[1888.54 → 1889.50] he is not
[1889.50 → 1890.52] absent.
[1891.52 → 1892.78] He is with
[1892.78 → 1893.14] us,
[1893.58 → 1894.60] still in
[1894.60 → 1895.06] control.
[1896.34 → 1897.22] Remember the
[1897.22 → 1898.34] stranger and
[1898.34 → 1899.80] be alert for
[1899.80 → 1900.72] God's strangers
[1900.72 → 1902.30] in your own
[1902.30 → 1902.72] life.
[1904.48 → 1905.44] Remember too
[1905.44 → 1905.88] that when
[1905.88 → 1906.64] God was
[1906.64 → 1907.18] the most
[1907.18 → 1908.28] absent at
[1908.28 → 1908.70] the cross
[1908.70 → 1909.26] of Christ,
[1909.64 → 1909.94] he was
[1909.94 → 1911.16] also the
[1911.16 → 1911.94] most near
[1911.94 → 1912.86] to save
[1912.86 → 1913.24] us from
[1913.24 → 1914.62] sin and
[1914.62 → 1915.12] make us
[1915.12 → 1915.66] heirs of
[1915.66 → 1916.42] his promise
[1916.42 → 1917.50] of a new
[1917.50 → 1918.68] life and
[1918.68 → 1919.06] a new
[1919.06 → 1920.20] creation where
[1920.20 → 1920.98] there is no
[1920.98 → 1922.04] more sin or
[1922.04 → 1923.14] sadness or
[1923.14 → 1924.36] dysfunction or
[1924.36 → 1925.60] disease or
[1925.60 → 1927.10] death anymore.
[1927.10 → 1927.28] him.
[1929.28 → 1930.44] The third
[1930.44 → 1931.30] seed of hope
[1931.30 → 1932.36] is in the
[1932.36 → 1932.88] chapter's
[1932.88 → 1934.22] last verse.
[1936.06 → 1936.68] Meanwhile,
[1937.34 → 1938.06] the Mediates
[1938.06 → 1938.72] sold Joseph
[1938.72 → 1939.48] in Egypt to
[1939.48 → 1940.02] Rotifer,
[1940.50 → 1940.96] one of
[1940.96 → 1941.42] Pharaoh's
[1941.42 → 1941.94] officials,
[1942.22 → 1942.76] the captain
[1942.76 → 1943.60] of the
[1943.60 → 1943.90] guard.
[1945.96 → 1946.96] Joseph lands
[1946.96 → 1947.64] in Egypt
[1947.64 → 1950.58] alive and
[1950.58 → 1951.28] is sold to
[1951.28 → 1952.12] someone closely
[1952.12 → 1953.62] associated with
[1953.62 → 1954.18] no less
[1954.18 → 1954.94] powerful a
[1954.94 → 1955.64] figure than
[1955.64 → 1956.10] the Pharaoh
[1956.10 → 1956.66] himself.
[1958.00 → 1958.76] Verse 36
[1958.76 → 1959.40] is sort of a
[1959.40 → 1959.98] poke in the
[1959.98 → 1960.42] ribs as if
[1960.42 → 1960.76] to say,
[1961.12 → 1961.32] hey,
[1961.44 → 1961.98] don't give
[1961.98 → 1962.16] up,
[1962.22 → 1962.62] the dream
[1962.62 → 1962.96] is still
[1962.96 → 1963.42] alive,
[1963.82 → 1964.38] God isn't
[1964.38 → 1964.76] dead and
[1964.76 → 1965.24] neither is
[1965.24 → 1965.60] Joseph,
[1965.94 → 1966.30] so keep
[1966.30 → 1966.60] reading.
[1968.44 → 1968.90] Yes,
[1968.96 → 1969.36] the story
[1969.36 → 1969.90] has taken a
[1969.90 → 1970.62] difficult turn.
[1970.96 → 1971.64] Everybody is
[1971.64 → 1972.10] suffering from
[1972.10 → 1972.44] the bad
[1972.44 → 1972.98] choices they
[1972.98 → 1973.50] have made,
[1973.88 → 1974.24] Jacob,
[1974.66 → 1975.02] Joseph,
[1975.36 → 1975.90] the brothers.
[1977.18 → 1977.80] But even
[1977.80 → 1978.98] when people
[1978.98 → 1979.68] take matters
[1979.68 → 1980.16] into their
[1980.16 → 1980.92] own hands
[1980.92 → 1982.44] with often
[1982.44 → 1983.16] disastrous
[1983.16 → 1983.96] consequences,
[1984.12 → 1984.56] even when
[1984.56 → 1984.92] things are
[1984.92 → 1986.04] falling apart,
[1987.10 → 1987.82] there is a
[1987.82 → 1988.46] voice on the
[1988.46 → 1989.98] sideline saying,
[1990.76 → 1991.04] yes,
[1991.72 → 1992.22] but.
[1994.14 → 1994.76] God's
[1994.76 → 1995.46] hidden hand
[1995.46 → 1996.06] is still at
[1996.06 → 1996.36] work,
[1997.42 → 1997.98] weaving the
[1997.98 → 1998.80] tapestry of a
[1998.80 → 1999.66] larger story,
[2000.46 → 2001.46] a story so
[2001.46 → 2002.36] big that its
[2002.36 → 2003.70] loving purpose,
[2004.18 → 2004.94] as we now know
[2004.94 → 2005.52] in Christ,
[2005.88 → 2006.68] will embrace
[2006.68 → 2007.64] the entire
[2007.64 → 2008.70] universe.
[2010.38 → 2011.14] Often we
[2011.14 → 2011.92] cannot see it
[2011.92 → 2012.88] in the struggles
[2012.88 → 2013.52] and sins,
[2013.94 → 2014.56] in the tears
[2014.56 → 2015.66] and tragedies
[2015.66 → 2016.52] of our lives,
[2017.12 → 2017.64] but this
[2017.64 → 2018.86] story bears
[2018.86 → 2019.70] witness to
[2019.70 → 2020.28] the Christian
[2020.28 → 2021.60] hope that
[2021.60 → 2022.40] in the longest
[2022.40 → 2023.44] possible run,
[2023.70 → 2024.70] it will all
[2024.70 → 2026.06] make sense.
[2026.68 → 2027.42] God will
[2027.42 → 2027.80] not,
[2027.92 → 2028.78] to use the
[2028.78 → 2029.58] language of my
[2029.58 → 2030.50] favourite reality
[2030.50 → 2030.78] show,
[2030.86 → 2031.40] Survivor,
[2031.86 → 2032.74] God will not
[2032.74 → 2034.28] be outwitted,
[2035.06 → 2035.92] outlasted,
[2036.20 → 2037.22] or outplayed
[2037.22 → 2038.72] by any human
[2038.72 → 2040.28] evil or any
[2040.28 → 2041.64] human empire.
[2041.64 → 2042.64] God,
[2042.64 → 2043.36] the living
[2043.36 → 2044.14] God whom we
[2044.14 → 2044.72] have come to
[2044.72 → 2045.72] know in Jesus
[2045.72 → 2046.46] Christ as
[2046.46 → 2047.48] faithful and
[2047.48 → 2048.40] gracious and
[2048.40 → 2049.42] full of mercy
[2049.42 → 2050.54] for all,
[2051.64 → 2052.90] will continue to
[2052.90 → 2053.70] write his story,
[2054.72 → 2055.58] a story that has
[2055.58 → 2056.42] been punctuated
[2056.42 → 2057.18] with a cross
[2057.18 → 2058.58] and an empty
[2058.58 → 2060.10] tomb so that
[2060.10 → 2061.76] we know the
[2061.76 → 2062.48] dream will go
[2062.48 → 2063.64] on, God's
[2063.64 → 2064.90] promises are
[2064.90 → 2065.72] not at an end,
[2065.98 → 2066.74] our world,
[2067.74 → 2069.04] our family,
[2069.04 → 2070.76] I do have
[2070.76 → 2071.80] a future.
[2073.18 → 2074.82] Just keep
[2074.82 → 2076.30] reading, keep
[2076.30 → 2077.16] following Christ
[2077.16 → 2078.08] because as the
[2078.08 → 2078.78] last verse of
[2078.78 → 2079.82] Genesis 37
[2079.82 → 2081.40] nicely reminds us
[2081.40 → 2082.46] when it comes to
[2082.46 → 2083.04] God and his
[2083.04 → 2084.18] people in and
[2084.18 → 2084.64] through even
[2084.64 → 2085.34] life's darkest
[2085.34 → 2086.36] moments, there
[2086.36 → 2087.04] is one more
[2087.04 → 2087.82] word that can
[2087.82 → 2088.80] always be spoken
[2088.80 → 2090.56] and that word
[2090.56 → 2092.22] is meanwhile.
[2093.84 → 2094.48] Meanwhile,
[2095.10 → 2096.66] that is,
[2096.66 → 2098.90] God will have
[2098.90 → 2099.92] the last word
[2099.92 → 2101.08] yet.
[2102.02 → 2102.94] In the name of
[2102.94 → 2103.56] the Father, the
[2103.56 → 2104.90] Son, and the
[2104.90 → 2105.44] Holy Spirit.
[2106.22 → 2106.96] Let's pray.
[2107.48 → 2108.18] Gracious God,
[2108.94 → 2109.84] we thank you
[2109.84 → 2110.62] for this story
[2110.62 → 2113.28] and we thank you
[2113.28 → 2114.26] for the assurance
[2114.26 → 2115.86] which we need
[2115.86 → 2117.08] perhaps more
[2117.08 → 2117.86] now than ever
[2117.86 → 2118.76] before in a
[2118.76 → 2119.62] world that seems
[2119.62 → 2120.20] to have turned
[2120.20 → 2121.10] upside down in
[2121.10 → 2121.98] so many ways
[2121.98 → 2123.98] that you are
[2123.98 → 2124.70] not absent,
[2125.28 → 2126.12] you are still
[2126.12 → 2127.04] here, you are
[2127.04 → 2127.60] still busy
[2127.60 → 2128.36] working out
[2128.36 → 2129.08] your purposes
[2129.08 → 2130.94] even through
[2130.94 → 2131.32] us.
[2132.36 → 2132.88] Help us,
[2133.02 → 2133.32] Lord, be
[2133.32 → 2134.22] attentive to
[2134.22 → 2134.80] your presence
[2134.80 → 2135.48] in our lives
[2135.48 → 2135.94] and world
[2135.94 → 2137.26] and use
[2137.26 → 2138.42] even us
[2138.42 → 2139.78] to bring about
[2139.78 → 2140.74] your kingdom.
[2141.22 → 2141.74] In Jesus'
[2141.92 → 2142.48] name we pray.
[2143.08 → 2143.36] Amen.
[2143.36 → 2143.48] Amen.
