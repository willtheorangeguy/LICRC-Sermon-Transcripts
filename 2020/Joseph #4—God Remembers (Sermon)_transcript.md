[0.00 --> 13.12]  So this morning we continue our study, our study, our series on the story of Joseph in the latter part of the book of Genesis.
[13.12 --> 23.94]  This is the fourth installment. I hope you've been following along with the first three, but even if you haven't been able to, I'm sure that today's message will still make sense to you.
[23.94 --> 33.98]  And the scripture reading this morning is from Genesis 40, and then also Genesis 41, but not the entire chapter.
[33.98 --> 40.68]  So it's a fairly long reading this morning, but we've got to get the whole story, right?
[40.84 --> 43.78]  So here goes, Genesis 40, beginning at verse 1.
[43.86 --> 50.82]  We read that sometime later, that is after Joseph had been in prison because of Potiphar's wife,
[50.82 --> 57.64]  Sometime later, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt offended their master, the king of Egypt.
[58.34 --> 62.82]  Pharaoh was angry with his two officials, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,
[63.46 --> 70.76]  and put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard in the same prison where Joseph was confined.
[71.76 --> 75.20]  The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he attended them.
[75.20 --> 82.20]  After they had been in custody for some time, each of the two men, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt,
[82.32 --> 85.82]  who were being held in prison, had a dream the same night.
[86.52 --> 89.18]  And each dream had a meaning of its own.
[90.24 --> 93.78]  When Joseph came to them the next morning, he saw that they were dejected.
[94.34 --> 98.50]  And so he asked Pharaoh's officials who were in custody with him in his master's house,
[98.50 --> 100.62]  Why do you look so sad today?
[101.84 --> 105.66]  We both had dreams, they answered, but there was no one to interpret them.
[106.58 --> 110.60]  Then Joseph said to them, Do not interpretations belong to God?
[111.36 --> 112.34]  Tell me your dreams.
[113.16 --> 115.42]  So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream.
[115.50 --> 120.98]  He said to him, In my dream I saw a vine in front of me, and on the vine were three branches.
[121.56 --> 126.40]  As soon as it budded, it blossomed, and its clusters ripened into grapes.
[126.40 --> 131.94]  It says, Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, squeezed them into Pharaoh's cup,
[132.06 --> 133.60]  and put the cup in his hand.
[135.72 --> 137.78]  This is what it means, Joseph said to him.
[138.44 --> 140.34]  The three branches are three days.
[141.80 --> 146.98]  Within three days, Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your position,
[147.42 --> 153.58]  and you will put Pharaoh's cup in his hand, just as you used to do when you were his cupbearer.
[153.58 --> 159.78]  But when all goes well with you, remember me, and show me kindness.
[160.34 --> 162.90]  Mention me to Pharaoh, and get me out of this prison.
[163.40 --> 167.20]  I was forcibly carried off from the land of the Hebrews, and even here,
[167.56 --> 171.10]  I have done nothing to deserve being put in a dungeon.
[171.10 --> 178.26]  When the chief baker saw that Joseph had given a favorable interpretation, he said to Joseph,
[179.04 --> 180.10]  I too had a dream.
[180.88 --> 183.28]  On my head were three baskets of bread.
[184.14 --> 187.18]  In the top basket were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh,
[187.46 --> 190.46]  but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.
[190.46 --> 194.42]  This is what it means, Joseph said.
[195.28 --> 197.22]  The three baskets are three days.
[198.02 --> 204.50]  Within three days, Pharaoh will lift off your head and impale your body on a pole,
[204.88 --> 208.00]  and the birds will eat away your flesh.
[209.30 --> 213.28]  Now the third day was Pharaoh's birthday, and he gave a feast for all his officials.
[213.64 --> 218.42]  He lifted up the heads of the chief cupbearer and the chief baker in the presence of his officials.
[218.42 --> 221.50]  He restored the chief cupbearer to his position,
[221.70 --> 224.64]  so that he once again put the cup into Pharaoh's hand,
[224.86 --> 230.66]  but he impaled the chief baker just as Joseph had said to them in his interpretation.
[231.74 --> 237.90]  The chief cupbearer, however, did not remember Joseph.
[238.90 --> 241.02]  He forgot him.
[243.88 --> 246.76]  When two full years had passed,
[246.76 --> 250.00]  Pharaoh had a dream.
[251.44 --> 252.66]  He was standing by the Nile,
[252.76 --> 254.92]  and out of the river there came up seven cows,
[255.08 --> 256.46]  sleek and fat,
[256.66 --> 258.52]  and they grazed among the reeds.
[259.16 --> 260.70]  After them, seven other cows,
[260.92 --> 261.94]  ugly and gaunt,
[262.04 --> 263.14]  came up out of the Nile
[263.14 --> 265.32]  and stood beside those on the riverbank.
[265.68 --> 268.24]  And the cows that were ugly and gaunt
[268.24 --> 270.66]  ate up the sleek, fat cows.
[271.66 --> 273.20]  Then Pharaoh woke up.
[273.20 --> 276.40]  He fell asleep again and had a second dream.
[276.76 --> 277.76]  Seven heads of grain,
[277.90 --> 278.70]  healthy and good,
[278.96 --> 280.44]  were growing on a single stalk.
[280.88 --> 281.42]  After them,
[281.56 --> 283.38]  seven other heads of grain sprouted,
[283.60 --> 285.56]  thin and scorched by the east wind.
[286.10 --> 288.78]  The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy,
[289.02 --> 289.58]  full heads.
[290.28 --> 291.60]  Then Pharaoh woke up.
[292.28 --> 293.24]  It had been a dream.
[294.30 --> 295.06]  In the morning,
[295.46 --> 296.76]  his mind was troubled.
[297.14 --> 300.14]  So he sent for all the magicians and the wise men of Egypt.
[300.14 --> 301.86]  Pharaoh told them his dreams,
[301.98 --> 303.74]  but no one could interpret them for him.
[305.04 --> 306.86]  Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh,
[307.58 --> 311.44]  Today I am reminded of my shortcomings.
[312.56 --> 314.56]  Pharaoh was once angry with his servants,
[314.68 --> 316.34]  and he imprisoned me and the chief baker
[316.34 --> 318.42]  in the house of the captain of the guard.
[318.86 --> 321.04]  Each of us had a dream the same night,
[321.26 --> 323.36]  and each dream had a meaning of its own.
[324.02 --> 326.02]  Now a young Hebrew was there with us,
[326.06 --> 327.74]  a servant of the captain of the guard.
[327.74 --> 329.44]  We told him our dreams,
[329.76 --> 331.30]  and he interpreted them for us,
[331.68 --> 334.26]  giving each man the interpretation of his dream,
[334.50 --> 338.02]  and things turned out exactly as he interpreted them to us.
[338.78 --> 340.62]  I was restored to my position,
[341.12 --> 343.10]  and the other man was impaled.
[344.48 --> 346.38]  So Pharaoh sent for Joseph,
[346.66 --> 348.48]  and he was quickly brought from the dungeon.
[348.70 --> 350.60]  When he had shaved and changed his clothes,
[350.78 --> 352.08]  he came before Pharaoh.
[352.60 --> 353.92]  Pharaoh said to Joseph,
[353.92 --> 355.26]  I had a dream,
[355.78 --> 357.26]  and no one can interpret it,
[357.68 --> 359.04]  but I have heard it said of you
[359.04 --> 360.24]  that when you hear a dream,
[360.48 --> 361.64]  you can interpret it.
[362.58 --> 363.76]  I cannot do it.
[364.50 --> 365.84]  Joseph replied to Pharaoh,
[366.42 --> 368.08]  I cannot do it,
[368.60 --> 370.70]  but God will give Pharaoh
[370.70 --> 372.88]  the answer he desires.
[373.84 --> 376.08]  We're now moving on to verse 25 in the chapter.
[376.08 --> 377.78]  Then Joseph said to Pharaoh,
[378.24 --> 380.90]  The dreams of Pharaoh are one and the same.
[380.90 --> 382.88]  God has revealed to Pharaoh
[382.88 --> 384.24]  what he is about to do.
[385.04 --> 387.00]  The seven good cows are seven years,
[387.32 --> 389.94]  and the seven good heads of grain are seven years.
[390.32 --> 391.94]  It is one and the same dream.
[392.76 --> 394.24]  The seven lean, ugly cows
[394.24 --> 396.16]  that came up afterward are seven years,
[396.42 --> 398.52]  and so are the seven worthless heads of grain
[398.52 --> 399.80]  scorched by the east wind.
[400.16 --> 402.34]  They are seven years of famine.
[403.58 --> 405.50]  It is just as I said to Pharaoh.
[405.94 --> 407.32]  God has shown Pharaoh
[407.32 --> 408.88]  what he is about to do.
[408.88 --> 411.32]  Seven years of great abundance
[411.32 --> 413.26]  are coming throughout the land of Egypt,
[413.68 --> 415.46]  but seven years of famine
[415.46 --> 416.40]  will follow them.
[417.28 --> 418.98]  Then all the abundance in Egypt
[418.98 --> 420.18]  will be forgotten,
[420.54 --> 422.58]  and the famine will ravage the land.
[422.88 --> 423.98]  The abundance in the land
[423.98 --> 425.08]  will not be remembered
[425.08 --> 426.96]  because the famine that follows it
[426.96 --> 428.10]  will be so severe.
[429.02 --> 431.06]  The reason the dream was given to Pharaoh
[431.06 --> 432.08]  in two forms
[432.08 --> 432.94]  is that the matter
[432.94 --> 435.26]  has been firmly decided by God,
[435.52 --> 438.16]  and God will do it soon.
[438.88 --> 442.26]  And now let Pharaoh look for a discerning
[442.26 --> 443.28]  and wise man
[443.28 --> 445.52]  and put him in charge of the land of Egypt.
[445.78 --> 448.40]  Let Pharaoh appoint commissioners over the land
[448.40 --> 450.58]  to take a fifth of the harvest of Egypt
[450.58 --> 452.62]  during the seven years of abundance.
[453.16 --> 454.86]  They should collect all the food
[454.86 --> 456.36]  of these good years that are coming,
[456.78 --> 459.18]  store up the grain under the authority of Pharaoh
[459.18 --> 461.58]  to be kept in the cities for food.
[462.06 --> 464.38]  This food should be held in reserve
[464.38 --> 465.12]  for the country
[465.12 --> 467.66]  to be used during the seven years of famine
[467.66 --> 469.26]  that will come upon Egypt
[469.26 --> 470.70]  so that the country
[470.70 --> 473.18]  may not be ruined by the famine.
[474.40 --> 476.46]  The plan seemed good to Pharaoh
[476.46 --> 478.12]  and to all his officials.
[478.84 --> 480.24]  So Pharaoh asked him,
[480.80 --> 483.24]  Can we find anyone like this man,
[483.72 --> 485.52]  one in whom is the Spirit of God?
[485.52 --> 488.26]  Then Pharaoh said to Joseph,
[488.90 --> 491.04]  Since God has made all this known to you,
[491.28 --> 494.56]  there is no one so discerning and wise as you.
[494.70 --> 496.56]  You shall be in charge of my palace,
[496.72 --> 499.88]  and all my people are to submit to your orders.
[500.42 --> 502.26]  Only with respect to the throne
[502.26 --> 505.26]  will I be greater than you.
[505.84 --> 507.88]  This is the word of the Lord.
[507.88 --> 515.34]  It is those devastating,
[515.86 --> 518.56]  crushing three words
[518.56 --> 521.54]  that come at the end of chapter 40.
[522.94 --> 524.60]  He forgot him.
[525.60 --> 527.56]  That remind me of a story
[527.56 --> 529.34]  about an experience which,
[529.52 --> 531.00]  if it has ever happened to you,
[531.88 --> 534.24]  you are not likely ever to forget.
[534.24 --> 538.12]  It happened to an older colleague of mine,
[538.84 --> 540.34]  Tony DeJager, now deceased,
[540.88 --> 542.62]  back in the 1960s
[542.62 --> 545.42]  while he was a pastor in Sarnia, Ontario,
[546.06 --> 547.58]  on a hot summer day.
[548.38 --> 551.16]  He decided to give his wife a break
[551.16 --> 552.62]  and take their six sons,
[553.18 --> 555.72]  ages 2 to 14, to the beach.
[556.80 --> 558.52]  Loading them in a station wagon
[558.52 --> 560.06]  together with some friends,
[560.14 --> 561.38]  they made lots of noise,
[561.64 --> 562.82]  they had lots of fun,
[562.82 --> 564.18]  and hours later,
[564.50 --> 565.58]  they drove home again,
[565.88 --> 567.14]  and they got about halfway
[567.14 --> 568.64]  when one of his boys
[568.64 --> 570.42]  shouted above all the noise,
[570.82 --> 572.90]  hey, dad, where's Ted?
[575.70 --> 577.46]  Instant panic.
[578.44 --> 580.96]  The youngest son had been forgotten.
[581.78 --> 582.88]  Left at the beach,
[583.46 --> 585.34]  dad made a screeching U-turn,
[585.72 --> 587.62]  ignored all posted speed limits
[587.62 --> 589.44]  and stop signs where possible,
[589.82 --> 591.76]  arrived breathless at the beach.
[592.82 --> 593.86]  And there was Ted,
[594.96 --> 596.26]  still sitting, playing,
[596.46 --> 598.60]  at the same spot they had left him.
[599.28 --> 600.68]  He'd never even noticed
[600.68 --> 602.14]  his family's absence.
[605.02 --> 607.16]  If that happened to you as a parent,
[608.16 --> 611.00]  I doubt that you would have reacted
[611.00 --> 613.40]  any differently than Ted's dad.
[613.40 --> 619.18]  But suppose that when he discovered Ted missing,
[620.02 --> 621.56]  he would have calmly said,
[622.88 --> 623.40]  oh well,
[624.04 --> 625.38]  no need to hurry.
[626.14 --> 627.54]  I have five other sons.
[627.66 --> 628.92]  What's one more or less?
[631.54 --> 632.52]  Can you imagine?
[632.52 --> 637.50]  And yet, I think there are times
[637.50 --> 640.70]  when we wonder if that is not
[640.70 --> 644.02]  how our Heavenly Father feels about us.
[645.62 --> 646.56]  Little Ted,
[646.78 --> 648.02]  one among six,
[648.98 --> 650.92]  did not realize he had been forgotten.
[650.92 --> 653.56]  But haven't you,
[653.56 --> 656.20]  one among seven billion plus
[656.20 --> 658.08]  currently living on earth,
[658.46 --> 661.20]  never mind the billions and billions more
[661.20 --> 663.34]  who have lived and died in history,
[663.74 --> 665.26]  each person unique,
[665.66 --> 668.00]  each person with his or her own story,
[668.64 --> 671.40]  haven't you ever felt forgotten
[671.40 --> 673.30]  by God?
[673.30 --> 676.68]  We tell each other
[676.68 --> 677.58]  and we tell our kids
[677.58 --> 680.12]  how important it is to know God.
[680.92 --> 682.94]  But in the final analysis,
[683.22 --> 685.96]  is it not this that really matters,
[686.46 --> 688.92]  that God knows my name,
[689.96 --> 691.42]  that God remembers,
[691.88 --> 694.42]  God cares about me?
[697.30 --> 698.68]  There is an old saying
[698.68 --> 701.28]  that everybody dies twice.
[701.28 --> 704.62]  First, we die physically
[704.62 --> 706.40]  and they bury us into the ground
[706.40 --> 708.18]  or they cremate our remains,
[708.30 --> 708.52]  whatever.
[710.10 --> 711.68]  We die a second time
[711.68 --> 714.38]  when the last relative or friend
[714.38 --> 715.88]  who can recall us
[715.88 --> 717.20]  passes away.
[718.36 --> 720.46]  And then the memory of us
[720.46 --> 722.48]  is buried too.
[723.94 --> 726.58]  Then in the words of Psalm 103,
[727.12 --> 728.52]  we become like grass,
[728.82 --> 730.30]  like a flower of the field,
[730.30 --> 732.14]  the wind blows over it
[732.14 --> 733.28]  and its place
[733.28 --> 735.84]  remembers it no more.
[738.22 --> 739.34]  And it's true.
[741.48 --> 745.38]  So, unless God remembers me,
[746.34 --> 748.28]  what hope do I have,
[748.36 --> 749.88]  do you have for the future?
[751.14 --> 752.48]  And without such hope,
[752.64 --> 754.10]  what meaning or purpose
[754.10 --> 756.92]  is there to your life?
[756.92 --> 762.52]  The gospel of Genesis 40 and 41,
[762.74 --> 763.10]  however,
[763.46 --> 765.76]  is that God does remember.
[767.76 --> 770.18]  God remembers his promise
[770.18 --> 772.46]  to bless Abraham and his descendants
[772.46 --> 775.04]  and thereby assures me
[775.04 --> 777.10]  that he knows my name.
[778.70 --> 780.62]  God remembers his promise
[780.62 --> 782.28]  to bless all people
[782.28 --> 784.30]  through Abraham and his descendants
[784.30 --> 786.30]  and thereby assures me
[786.30 --> 787.84]  that he knows and rules
[787.84 --> 790.68]  all peoples and events.
[792.76 --> 794.84]  He remembers first his promise
[794.84 --> 797.16]  to bless Abraham and his descendants
[797.16 --> 798.54]  and this in spite
[798.54 --> 801.00]  all evidence to the contrary.
[801.72 --> 804.34]  Joseph could tell you about that.
[804.34 --> 808.42]  When we left off his story last week,
[808.68 --> 810.00]  he'd been falsely accused
[810.00 --> 811.10]  of attempted rape
[811.10 --> 812.58]  and been thrown into prison.
[813.66 --> 814.96]  But just as Joseph
[814.96 --> 816.00]  had found himself
[816.00 --> 817.10]  stripped of his clothes
[817.10 --> 818.24]  for a second time,
[818.54 --> 820.42]  the victim of other people's spite,
[820.86 --> 822.54]  so for a second time,
[822.80 --> 825.44]  because the Lord was with Joseph,
[826.44 --> 829.12]  he prospered again
[829.12 --> 831.22]  in difficult circumstances.
[831.22 --> 833.32]  Before you know it,
[833.38 --> 834.76]  the warden entrusts Joseph
[834.76 --> 836.22]  with running the whole prison,
[836.60 --> 839.08]  just as Potiphar had entrusted Joseph
[839.08 --> 841.04]  with running his whole household.
[841.82 --> 842.68]  But of course,
[843.22 --> 844.68]  it is still prison.
[846.18 --> 847.46]  Then one day,
[848.16 --> 849.28]  it so happens.
[850.34 --> 851.88]  A ridiculous term I know
[851.88 --> 854.02]  in a story where nothing so happens.
[854.72 --> 856.26]  But it so happens
[856.26 --> 857.76]  that the pharaohs,
[857.94 --> 858.96]  butler and baker,
[858.96 --> 860.40]  for no reason given,
[861.30 --> 862.40]  join him in prison,
[863.12 --> 864.52]  and the captain of the guard,
[865.18 --> 866.76]  our old friend Potiphar,
[868.06 --> 870.62]  assigns their care to Joseph.
[871.88 --> 873.30]  And before you know it,
[873.40 --> 874.46]  Joseph finds himself
[874.46 --> 876.22]  in the dream business again.
[877.36 --> 878.70]  Both butler and baker
[878.70 --> 879.94]  have a similar dream
[879.94 --> 881.34]  at the same night,
[881.70 --> 883.10]  and Joseph, with God's help,
[883.26 --> 883.98]  interprets them.
[884.78 --> 886.16]  And it's almost funny,
[886.16 --> 887.56]  if it weren't so sad,
[887.94 --> 889.06]  because both dreams
[889.06 --> 890.32]  involve the expression
[890.32 --> 891.72]  lifting your head.
[892.88 --> 893.46]  Your head,
[893.66 --> 895.40]  Joseph says to the cupbearer,
[895.56 --> 896.70]  will be lifted up.
[896.80 --> 897.30]  That is,
[897.52 --> 898.60]  you will be restored
[898.60 --> 899.52]  to your position,
[899.82 --> 900.70]  but your head,
[901.04 --> 902.26]  says Joseph to the baker,
[902.50 --> 904.42]  will be lifted off.
[905.42 --> 906.36]  That is,
[906.72 --> 908.68]  you will be executed.
[908.68 --> 911.28]  Wow.
[912.06 --> 913.42]  You may wonder
[913.42 --> 914.36]  if Joseph
[914.36 --> 916.06]  could not have sugar-coated
[916.06 --> 916.78]  that message
[916.78 --> 917.92]  to the baker
[917.92 --> 919.30]  just a little bit.
[921.70 --> 922.80]  But remember
[922.80 --> 924.02]  that Joseph's hopes
[924.02 --> 924.98]  were now riding
[924.98 --> 926.50]  on the cupbearer.
[926.80 --> 927.92]  Had he lied,
[928.28 --> 929.44]  just to be kind,
[929.76 --> 930.60]  the cupbearer
[930.60 --> 931.86]  would not have been convinced
[931.86 --> 932.72]  of his ability
[932.72 --> 933.94]  to interpret dreams.
[934.38 --> 935.98]  He would have seen Joseph
[935.98 --> 937.20]  as a well-meaning guy
[937.20 --> 938.20]  who flipped the coin
[938.20 --> 939.84]  and got one right
[939.84 --> 940.68]  and one wrong.
[942.20 --> 943.20]  Honesty and integrity
[943.76 --> 945.48]  in revealing God's meaning,
[945.76 --> 946.20]  however painful,
[947.06 --> 947.94]  were required
[947.94 --> 949.20]  to convince the cupbearer
[949.86 --> 950.62]  that Joseph
[950.62 --> 951.80]  was the real deal
[951.80 --> 953.42]  and worth a recommendation
[953.42 --> 954.16]  to Pharaoh
[954.16 --> 955.64]  because you don't
[955.64 --> 956.82]  mess with Pharaoh,
[956.98 --> 957.36]  you know.
[958.26 --> 959.28]  Not when he's got
[959.28 --> 960.98]  your life in his hands.
[960.98 --> 963.86]  And he does
[963.86 --> 965.80]  because when Pharaoh
[965.80 --> 967.14]  celebrates his birthday
[967.14 --> 967.98]  three days later
[967.98 --> 968.90]  and throws a party
[968.90 --> 970.20]  for all of his officials,
[970.76 --> 971.58]  what happens?
[971.72 --> 972.54]  Both cupbearer
[972.54 --> 973.04]  and baker
[973.04 --> 973.80]  are invited
[973.80 --> 974.86]  and we read
[974.86 --> 976.06]  he lifted up
[976.06 --> 976.50]  the heads
[976.50 --> 977.80]  of the chief cupbearer
[977.80 --> 979.12]  and the chief baker.
[979.46 --> 980.04]  That is,
[980.10 --> 981.44]  he restored the butler
[981.44 --> 983.04]  but beheaded
[983.04 --> 984.26]  the baker.
[984.26 --> 986.96]  And surely
[986.96 --> 987.88]  the cupbearer
[987.88 --> 988.82]  in his relief
[988.82 --> 989.46]  and joy
[989.46 --> 990.40]  would remember
[990.40 --> 991.40]  Joseph's plea
[991.40 --> 992.58]  to remember him
[992.58 --> 993.98]  and tell Pharaoh
[993.98 --> 995.40]  about this amazing
[995.40 --> 996.02]  young man
[996.02 --> 996.94]  he had met
[996.94 --> 997.54]  in prison.
[998.90 --> 999.86]  But no.
[1001.08 --> 1001.54]  Instead,
[1001.76 --> 1002.16]  you read
[1002.16 --> 1002.92]  those last
[1002.92 --> 1004.46]  awful words
[1004.46 --> 1005.70]  of chapter 40.
[1006.84 --> 1008.08]  The chief cupbearer,
[1008.14 --> 1008.54]  however,
[1009.14 --> 1010.16]  did not remember
[1010.16 --> 1010.56]  Joseph.
[1011.72 --> 1012.68]  He forgot him.
[1014.26 --> 1018.02]  Think about the pain
[1018.02 --> 1020.24]  in those three words.
[1021.34 --> 1022.50]  He forgot him.
[1024.72 --> 1026.70]  Joseph was 17 years old
[1026.70 --> 1028.06]  when his brother
[1028.06 --> 1029.40]  sold him into slavery.
[1030.50 --> 1031.18]  17.
[1032.78 --> 1034.74]  And most of the 11 years
[1034.74 --> 1035.16]  since,
[1035.30 --> 1036.72]  11 years of his
[1036.72 --> 1037.78]  precious youth
[1037.78 --> 1039.34]  had been lost
[1039.34 --> 1040.40]  in prison.
[1041.90 --> 1043.32]  Imagine the crushing
[1043.32 --> 1044.10]  disappointment
[1044.10 --> 1045.10]  he must have felt
[1045.10 --> 1045.84]  most strongly
[1045.84 --> 1047.36]  after the cupbearer's
[1047.36 --> 1047.80]  release.
[1048.18 --> 1048.50]  Here,
[1048.80 --> 1049.28]  finally,
[1049.60 --> 1050.22]  was a ray
[1050.22 --> 1050.98]  of hope.
[1052.54 --> 1054.04]  But the cupbearer
[1054.04 --> 1055.22]  forgot him.
[1056.20 --> 1057.20]  Joseph hears
[1057.20 --> 1058.34]  nothing.
[1058.92 --> 1059.84]  Not a card.
[1060.18 --> 1061.02]  Not a visit
[1061.02 --> 1061.98]  for two
[1061.98 --> 1063.18]  whole years.
[1063.18 --> 1066.60]  is it hard
[1066.60 --> 1067.24]  to imagine
[1067.24 --> 1068.34]  that there were
[1068.34 --> 1068.74]  days,
[1068.86 --> 1069.46]  maybe weeks
[1069.46 --> 1070.22]  and months
[1070.22 --> 1070.78]  when Joseph
[1070.78 --> 1071.30]  wondered
[1071.30 --> 1073.08]  whether God
[1073.08 --> 1074.28]  had simply
[1074.28 --> 1075.04]  forgotten him.
[1077.92 --> 1078.48]  Forgotten.
[1079.82 --> 1080.66]  Haven't you ever
[1080.66 --> 1081.08]  been there?
[1082.48 --> 1083.54]  It can happen
[1083.54 --> 1084.82]  that there are
[1084.82 --> 1085.68]  times and seasons
[1085.68 --> 1086.54]  in your life
[1086.54 --> 1087.24]  when you feel
[1087.24 --> 1088.10]  as though the whole
[1088.10 --> 1089.10]  world is lined up
[1089.10 --> 1089.78]  against you,
[1090.04 --> 1090.94]  as though you are
[1090.94 --> 1091.64]  all alone
[1091.64 --> 1092.84]  where you call
[1092.84 --> 1094.22]  out and nobody
[1094.22 --> 1095.06]  answers.
[1096.64 --> 1097.84]  It can happen
[1097.84 --> 1099.22]  when you stand
[1099.22 --> 1100.02]  at a graveside
[1100.02 --> 1100.52]  of someone
[1100.52 --> 1101.22]  you loved
[1101.22 --> 1103.08]  or in the middle
[1103.08 --> 1103.58]  of the night
[1103.58 --> 1104.66]  while lying
[1104.66 --> 1105.70]  in a hospital bed
[1105.70 --> 1107.00]  or when you're
[1107.00 --> 1107.42]  struggling
[1107.42 --> 1108.68]  with depression.
[1109.38 --> 1110.24]  The world
[1110.24 --> 1110.86]  goes on
[1110.86 --> 1111.76]  but you are
[1111.76 --> 1112.80]  mired in pain.
[1113.92 --> 1114.54]  Other people's
[1114.54 --> 1115.38]  prayers are answered
[1115.38 --> 1116.70]  but heaven seems
[1116.70 --> 1117.76]  deaf to your pleading.
[1117.76 --> 1119.30]  Other people
[1119.30 --> 1119.84]  talk about
[1119.84 --> 1120.96]  wonderful experiences
[1120.96 --> 1121.68]  of God's
[1121.68 --> 1122.16]  blessing
[1122.16 --> 1123.00]  and God's
[1123.00 --> 1123.44]  care
[1123.44 --> 1126.12]  while you wonder
[1126.12 --> 1126.86]  what in the world
[1126.86 --> 1127.84]  God is doing
[1127.84 --> 1129.16]  in your life.
[1130.46 --> 1131.44]  It can happen
[1131.44 --> 1132.34]  in lots of ways
[1132.34 --> 1133.88]  and lots of times.
[1134.96 --> 1136.24]  I'm just
[1136.24 --> 1137.68]  forgotten.
[1140.96 --> 1141.64]  Forgotten.
[1142.00 --> 1142.52]  That's
[1142.52 --> 1143.60]  Joseph's story.
[1143.60 --> 1145.24]  for two
[1145.24 --> 1146.00]  whole
[1146.00 --> 1146.90]  silent
[1146.90 --> 1147.76]  years
[1147.76 --> 1151.00]  and then
[1151.00 --> 1152.32]  one day
[1152.32 --> 1153.96]  the silence
[1153.96 --> 1155.36]  is broken.
[1156.64 --> 1157.18]  Pharaoh's
[1157.18 --> 1157.62]  court
[1157.62 --> 1158.46]  is in a
[1158.46 --> 1158.96]  frenzy.
[1160.08 --> 1160.64]  Pharaoh has
[1160.64 --> 1161.38]  had dreams
[1161.38 --> 1161.98]  disturbing
[1161.98 --> 1162.56]  dreams
[1162.56 --> 1163.74]  like Joseph's
[1163.74 --> 1164.04]  dreams
[1164.04 --> 1164.52]  like those
[1164.52 --> 1164.80]  of the
[1164.80 --> 1165.30]  cup bearer
[1165.30 --> 1165.58]  and the
[1165.58 --> 1165.84]  baker
[1165.84 --> 1166.58]  not some
[1166.58 --> 1166.90]  hazy
[1166.90 --> 1167.32]  nonsense
[1167.32 --> 1168.12]  between sleep
[1168.12 --> 1168.56]  and waking
[1168.56 --> 1169.22]  who knows
[1169.22 --> 1169.54]  what it
[1169.54 --> 1169.84]  means.
[1169.84 --> 1170.62]  this
[1170.62 --> 1171.06]  Pharaoh
[1171.06 --> 1171.98]  instinctively
[1171.98 --> 1172.28]  knew
[1172.28 --> 1172.90]  was the
[1172.90 --> 1173.48]  real thing.
[1173.60 --> 1173.90]  This was
[1173.90 --> 1174.20]  something
[1174.20 --> 1174.56]  more
[1174.56 --> 1175.22]  something
[1175.22 --> 1175.58]  from
[1175.58 --> 1176.10]  beyond
[1176.10 --> 1177.32]  but none
[1177.32 --> 1177.58]  of his
[1177.58 --> 1178.18]  magicians
[1178.18 --> 1178.76]  none of
[1178.76 --> 1179.22]  his wise
[1179.22 --> 1179.54]  men
[1179.54 --> 1180.38]  had a
[1180.38 --> 1180.64]  clue.
[1182.20 --> 1182.28]  And
[1182.28 --> 1182.72]  then
[1182.72 --> 1183.44]  the
[1183.44 --> 1183.72]  chief
[1183.72 --> 1184.10]  cup
[1184.10 --> 1184.92]  bearer
[1184.92 --> 1185.56]  remembered
[1185.56 --> 1187.42]  and
[1187.42 --> 1187.92]  God
[1187.92 --> 1189.02]  remembered.
[1189.98 --> 1190.46]  Joseph
[1190.46 --> 1191.00]  is down
[1191.00 --> 1191.48]  10-0
[1191.48 --> 1192.16]  at the
[1192.16 --> 1192.42]  second
[1192.42 --> 1193.02]  intermission
[1193.02 --> 1193.66]  and it's
[1193.66 --> 1193.96]  comeback
[1193.96 --> 1194.46]  time.
[1194.98 --> 1195.14]  One
[1195.14 --> 1195.44]  little
[1195.44 --> 1195.88]  cog
[1195.88 --> 1196.18]  in the
[1196.18 --> 1196.38]  wheel
[1196.38 --> 1196.56]  of
[1196.56 --> 1197.04]  providence
[1197.04 --> 1197.44]  connects
[1197.44 --> 1197.90]  with
[1197.90 --> 1198.22]  another
[1198.22 --> 1198.68]  and the
[1198.68 --> 1198.96]  gears
[1198.96 --> 1199.56]  of God's
[1199.56 --> 1199.94]  purposes
[1199.94 --> 1200.50]  move
[1200.50 --> 1200.96]  forward.
[1202.00 --> 1202.24]  Joseph
[1202.24 --> 1202.52]  gets
[1202.52 --> 1202.88]  hauled
[1202.88 --> 1203.00]  out
[1203.00 --> 1203.12]  of
[1203.12 --> 1203.36]  prison
[1203.36 --> 1203.58]  to
[1203.58 --> 1203.92]  stand
[1203.92 --> 1204.28]  before
[1204.28 --> 1204.48]  the
[1204.48 --> 1204.80]  Pharaoh
[1204.80 --> 1205.44]  and he
[1205.44 --> 1205.76]  comes
[1205.76 --> 1206.04]  through
[1206.04 --> 1206.42]  again.
[1207.42 --> 1207.52]  He
[1207.52 --> 1208.18]  acknowledges
[1208.18 --> 1208.56]  God
[1208.56 --> 1208.92]  as the
[1208.92 --> 1209.20]  source
[1209.20 --> 1209.50]  of the
[1209.50 --> 1209.94]  dreams
[1209.94 --> 1210.70]  then he
[1210.70 --> 1211.12]  tells it
[1211.12 --> 1211.46]  like it
[1211.46 --> 1211.70]  is.
[1212.02 --> 1212.30]  Seven
[1212.30 --> 1212.64]  years
[1212.64 --> 1212.84]  of
[1212.84 --> 1213.44]  incredible
[1213.44 --> 1214.04]  abundance
[1214.04 --> 1214.40]  followed
[1214.40 --> 1215.04]  by seven
[1215.04 --> 1215.50]  years
[1215.50 --> 1216.54]  of equally
[1216.54 --> 1217.22]  incredible
[1217.22 --> 1217.94]  famine.
[1218.82 --> 1218.92]  And
[1218.92 --> 1219.44]  before you
[1219.44 --> 1219.82]  know it
[1219.82 --> 1220.44]  Joseph's
[1220.44 --> 1220.66]  head
[1220.66 --> 1221.40]  is lifted
[1221.40 --> 1221.74]  up.
[1222.42 --> 1222.58]  As
[1222.58 --> 1222.86]  quickly
[1222.86 --> 1223.20]  as he
[1223.20 --> 1223.70]  was buried
[1223.70 --> 1224.24]  in prison
[1224.24 --> 1225.36]  by Potiphar
[1225.36 --> 1225.88]  Joseph
[1225.88 --> 1226.50]  has raised
[1226.50 --> 1226.80]  a new
[1226.80 --> 1227.10]  life
[1227.10 --> 1227.66]  in the
[1227.66 --> 1227.88]  kingdom
[1227.88 --> 1228.48]  of Egypt
[1228.48 --> 1229.58]  second in
[1229.58 --> 1229.96]  power
[1229.96 --> 1230.66]  only to
[1230.66 --> 1231.00]  Pharaoh
[1231.00 --> 1232.02]  given a
[1232.02 --> 1232.30]  wife
[1232.30 --> 1232.86]  who bears
[1232.86 --> 1233.06]  him
[1233.06 --> 1233.52]  children
[1233.52 --> 1234.28]  blessed
[1234.28 --> 1234.76]  beyond
[1234.76 --> 1235.26]  measure
[1235.26 --> 1236.16]  because
[1236.16 --> 1236.94]  finally
[1236.94 --> 1237.62]  the cup
[1237.62 --> 1238.02]  bearer
[1238.02 --> 1238.70]  remembered
[1238.70 --> 1239.08]  him.
[1240.08 --> 1240.96]  No.
[1241.96 --> 1242.80]  No.
[1243.80 --> 1244.20]  Because
[1244.20 --> 1244.76]  God
[1244.76 --> 1245.90]  had never
[1245.90 --> 1246.48]  forgotten
[1246.48 --> 1247.12]  Joseph.
[1248.12 --> 1248.68]  God
[1248.68 --> 1249.18]  remembered
[1249.18 --> 1249.64]  Joseph
[1249.64 --> 1250.32]  even when
[1250.32 --> 1251.16]  all others
[1251.16 --> 1252.26]  had forgotten.
[1252.26 --> 1253.64]  God
[1253.64 --> 1253.88]  remembers
[1253.88 --> 1254.64]  God
[1254.64 --> 1254.94]  remembers
[1254.94 --> 1255.80]  God
[1255.80 --> 1256.80]  remembers
[1256.80 --> 1257.72]  God
[1257.72 --> 1259.74]  remembers
[1259.74 --> 1261.70]  us.
[1261.70 --> 1263.88]  God
[1263.88 --> 1264.80]  remembers
[1264.80 --> 1266.52]  and
[1266.52 --> 1266.86]  throughout
[1266.86 --> 1267.42]  the Old
[1267.42 --> 1267.86]  Testament
[1267.86 --> 1268.70]  this fact
[1268.70 --> 1269.10]  is a
[1269.10 --> 1269.66]  consistent
[1269.66 --> 1270.24]  source
[1270.24 --> 1271.06]  of deep
[1271.06 --> 1271.56]  comfort
[1271.56 --> 1272.08]  and
[1272.08 --> 1272.74]  thanksgiving.
[1274.30 --> 1274.62]  God
[1274.62 --> 1275.20]  remembers
[1275.20 --> 1275.64]  us.
[1276.12 --> 1276.32]  God
[1276.32 --> 1276.86]  remembers
[1276.86 --> 1277.28]  that we
[1277.28 --> 1277.78]  are but
[1277.78 --> 1278.38]  dust.
[1278.94 --> 1279.14]  God
[1279.14 --> 1279.66]  remembers
[1279.66 --> 1280.32]  his promise
[1280.32 --> 1280.90]  to Abraham
[1280.90 --> 1281.42]  and his
[1281.42 --> 1281.94]  descendants.
[1282.56 --> 1282.84]  Hundreds
[1282.84 --> 1283.50]  of years
[1283.50 --> 1284.06]  after
[1284.06 --> 1284.54]  Joseph
[1284.54 --> 1285.00]  when
[1285.00 --> 1285.32]  Egypt
[1285.32 --> 1285.70]  gets
[1285.70 --> 1286.06]  a new
[1286.06 --> 1286.34]  king
[1286.34 --> 1286.70]  who
[1286.70 --> 1287.20]  doesn't
[1287.20 --> 1287.60]  know
[1287.60 --> 1288.08]  Joseph
[1288.08 --> 1288.62]  and
[1288.62 --> 1289.02]  Israel
[1289.02 --> 1289.50]  finds
[1289.50 --> 1289.86]  herself
[1289.86 --> 1290.06]  in
[1290.06 --> 1290.50]  hopeless
[1290.50 --> 1291.04]  slavery
[1291.04 --> 1291.48]  in
[1291.48 --> 1291.86]  Egypt
[1291.86 --> 1292.58]  Moses
[1292.58 --> 1293.04]  writes
[1293.04 --> 1293.38]  these
[1293.38 --> 1293.76]  words
[1293.76 --> 1294.44]  God
[1294.44 --> 1295.02]  heard
[1295.02 --> 1295.24]  their
[1295.24 --> 1295.74]  groaning
[1295.74 --> 1296.26]  and
[1296.26 --> 1296.46]  he
[1296.46 --> 1297.20]  remembered
[1297.20 --> 1297.60]  his
[1297.60 --> 1298.14]  covenant
[1298.14 --> 1298.98]  with
[1298.98 --> 1299.50]  Abraham
[1299.50 --> 1300.20]  with
[1300.20 --> 1300.78]  Isaac
[1300.78 --> 1301.32]  and
[1301.32 --> 1301.54]  with
[1301.54 --> 1301.94]  Jacob
[1301.94 --> 1303.42]  and
[1303.42 --> 1303.94]  God's
[1303.94 --> 1304.46]  remembering
[1304.46 --> 1304.94]  gives
[1304.94 --> 1305.26]  new
[1305.26 --> 1305.70]  hope
[1305.70 --> 1306.44]  and
[1306.44 --> 1306.64]  new
[1306.64 --> 1307.08]  future.
[1308.12 --> 1308.48]  Later
[1308.48 --> 1308.80]  in the
[1308.80 --> 1308.96]  Old
[1308.96 --> 1309.34]  Testament
[1309.34 --> 1309.62]  when
[1309.62 --> 1309.98]  God's
[1309.98 --> 1310.14]  Old
[1310.14 --> 1310.48]  Testament
[1310.48 --> 1310.92]  people
[1310.92 --> 1311.40]  are
[1311.40 --> 1311.62]  in
[1311.62 --> 1312.08]  exile
[1312.08 --> 1312.32]  and
[1312.32 --> 1312.70]  slavery
[1312.70 --> 1312.94]  in
[1312.94 --> 1313.22]  another
[1313.22 --> 1313.80]  empire
[1313.80 --> 1314.50]  Babylon
[1314.50 --> 1314.88]  they
[1314.88 --> 1315.24]  said
[1315.24 --> 1315.68]  the
[1315.68 --> 1315.98]  Lord
[1315.98 --> 1316.24]  has
[1316.24 --> 1316.80]  forsaken
[1316.80 --> 1317.08]  me
[1317.08 --> 1317.90]  the
[1317.90 --> 1318.18]  Lord
[1318.18 --> 1318.46]  has
[1318.46 --> 1319.02]  forgotten
[1319.02 --> 1319.48]  me
[1319.48 --> 1321.38]  but
[1321.38 --> 1321.56]  the
[1321.56 --> 1321.92]  prophet
[1321.92 --> 1322.36]  Isaiah
[1322.36 --> 1322.80]  speaking
[1322.80 --> 1323.04]  on
[1323.04 --> 1323.44]  behalf
[1323.44 --> 1323.64]  of
[1323.64 --> 1323.96]  God
[1323.96 --> 1324.48]  asked
[1324.48 --> 1324.68]  the
[1324.68 --> 1325.04]  question
[1325.04 --> 1325.56]  can
[1325.56 --> 1325.78]  a
[1325.78 --> 1326.00]  mother
[1326.00 --> 1326.44]  forget
[1326.44 --> 1326.68]  the
[1326.68 --> 1327.02]  baby
[1327.02 --> 1327.48]  at
[1327.48 --> 1327.66]  her
[1327.66 --> 1328.04]  breast
[1328.04 --> 1328.24]  and
[1328.24 --> 1328.48]  have
[1328.48 --> 1328.78]  no
[1328.78 --> 1329.48]  compassion
[1329.48 --> 1329.98]  on
[1329.98 --> 1330.14]  the
[1330.14 --> 1330.54]  child
[1330.54 --> 1330.72]  she
[1330.72 --> 1330.92]  has
[1330.92 --> 1331.28]  born
[1331.28 --> 1332.76]  and
[1332.76 --> 1332.96]  of
[1332.96 --> 1333.26]  course
[1333.26 --> 1333.46]  a
[1333.46 --> 1333.82]  normal
[1333.82 --> 1334.12]  mother
[1334.12 --> 1334.50]  never
[1334.50 --> 1334.80]  would
[1334.80 --> 1336.18]  even
[1336.18 --> 1336.42]  though
[1336.42 --> 1336.74]  mothers
[1336.74 --> 1337.18]  are not
[1337.18 --> 1337.60]  perfect
[1337.60 --> 1338.16]  anymore
[1338.16 --> 1338.76]  than
[1338.76 --> 1339.40]  fathers who
[1339.40 --> 1339.76]  leave their
[1339.76 --> 1340.04]  youngest
[1340.04 --> 1340.38]  alone
[1340.38 --> 1340.76]  on a
[1340.76 --> 1341.06]  beach
[1341.06 --> 1341.98]  any more
[1341.98 --> 1342.48]  than our
[1342.48 --> 1342.90]  children
[1342.90 --> 1344.08]  it is impossible
[1344.08 --> 1345.10]  to imagine
[1345.10 --> 1346.02]  a normal
[1346.02 --> 1346.42]  mother
[1346.42 --> 1347.40]  forgetting the
[1347.40 --> 1348.06]  face of the
[1348.06 --> 1348.46]  one she
[1348.46 --> 1348.96]  carried
[1348.96 --> 1350.12]  and birthed

[1351.76 --> 1352.74]  never
[1352.74 --> 1356.46]  sadly
[1356.46 --> 1356.48]  sadly
[1356.48 --> 1356.92]  however
[1356.92 --> 1357.30]  as
[1357.30 --> 1357.56]  God
[1357.56 --> 1358.04]  admits
[1358.04 --> 1359.12]  though
[1359.12 --> 1359.44]  she
[1359.44 --> 1359.70]  may
[1359.70 --> 1360.18]  forget
[1360.18 --> 1360.46]  he
[1360.46 --> 1360.92]  says
[1360.92 --> 1362.24]  there
[1362.24 --> 1362.58]  are
[1362.58 --> 1363.26]  exceptions
[1363.26 --> 1364.08]  some
[1364.08 --> 1364.38]  thrown
[1364.38 --> 1364.86]  through
[1364.86 --> 1365.40]  no fault
[1365.40 --> 1365.68]  of their

[1366.36 --> 1366.64]  mental
[1366.64 --> 1367.22]  disease
[1367.22 --> 1367.92]  others
[1367.92 --> 1368.36]  because
[1368.36 --> 1368.56]  of
[1368.56 --> 1368.90]  sinful
[1368.90 --> 1369.42]  neglect
[1369.42 --> 1370.12]  but
[1370.12 --> 1370.86]  though
[1370.86 --> 1371.22]  she
[1371.22 --> 1371.54]  may
[1371.54 --> 1372.04]  forget
[1372.04 --> 1373.76]  says
[1373.76 --> 1373.96]  the
[1373.96 --> 1374.24]  Lord
[1374.24 --> 1375.50]  I
[1375.50 --> 1376.00]  will
[1376.00 --> 1376.44]  not
[1376.44 --> 1377.12]  forget
[1377.12 --> 1378.24]  you
[1378.24 --> 1381.60]  see
[1381.60 --> 1382.12]  I have
[1382.12 --> 1382.74]  engraved
[1382.74 --> 1383.00]  you
[1383.00 --> 1384.10]  on the
[1384.10 --> 1384.52]  palms
[1384.52 --> 1385.00]  of my
[1385.00 --> 1385.46]  hands
[1385.46 --> 1386.84]  your

[1387.32 --> 1387.76]  written
[1387.76 --> 1388.56]  on God's
[1388.56 --> 1388.98]  hands
[1388.98 --> 1389.80]  not just
[1389.80 --> 1390.18]  with a
[1390.18 --> 1390.48]  pen
[1390.48 --> 1391.34]  so that
[1391.34 --> 1391.52]  they're
[1391.52 --> 1391.84]  easily
[1391.84 --> 1392.26]  rubbed
[1392.26 --> 1392.54]  off

[1393.08 --> 1393.42]  away
[1393.42 --> 1393.82]  the first
[1393.82 --> 1394.16]  time you
[1394.16 --> 1394.42]  wash
[1394.42 --> 1394.96]  your hands
[1394.96 --> 1395.82]  but
[1395.82 --> 1396.70]  engraved
[1396.70 --> 1397.52]  carved
[1397.52 --> 1398.54]  with a
[1398.54 --> 1398.96]  knife
[1398.96 --> 1399.82]  into
[1399.82 --> 1400.12]  his
[1400.12 --> 1400.58]  hand

[1401.60 --> 1402.22]  permanent
[1402.22 --> 1403.04]  mark
[1403.04 --> 1405.22]  God
[1405.22 --> 1405.76]  remembers
[1405.76 --> 1406.46]  and it
[1406.46 --> 1406.78]  is what
[1406.78 --> 1407.00]  his

[1408.50 --> 1408.72]  too
[1408.72 --> 1409.30]  Jesus
[1409.30 --> 1409.86]  told us
[1409.86 --> 1410.38]  to address
[1410.38 --> 1410.74]  God
[1410.74 --> 1411.02]  as

[1413.18 --> 1413.68]  teach us
[1413.68 --> 1413.86]  that
[1413.86 --> 1414.18]  God
[1414.18 --> 1414.42]  does
[1414.42 --> 1414.62]  not

[1423.24 --> 1423.56]  Jesus
[1423.56 --> 1423.92]  once
[1423.92 --> 1424.32]  asked

[1608.44 --> 1609.46]  to
[1609.46 --> 1609.70]  have
[1609.70 --> 1610.06]  Joseph
[1610.06 --> 1610.60]  released
[1610.60 --> 1611.40]  immediately
[1611.40 --> 1612.26]  I know
[1612.26 --> 1612.58]  this is
[1612.58 --> 1612.78]  all
[1612.78 --> 1613.30]  speculation
[1613.30 --> 1613.72]  but
[1613.72 --> 1614.20]  Joseph
[1614.20 --> 1614.62]  might
[1614.62 --> 1614.72]  have
[1614.72 --> 1614.92]  gone
[1614.92 --> 1615.16]  back
[1615.16 --> 1615.48]  home
[1615.48 --> 1616.72]  and
[1616.72 --> 1617.08]  God
[1617.08 --> 1617.32]  needs
[1617.32 --> 1617.48]  him
[1617.48 --> 1617.62]  in
[1617.62 --> 1618.06]  Egypt
[1618.06 --> 1619.32]  God
[1619.32 --> 1619.52]  has
[1619.52 --> 1619.80]  something
[1619.80 --> 1620.22]  bigger
[1620.22 --> 1620.50]  and
[1620.50 --> 1620.76]  better
[1620.76 --> 1621.02]  for
[1621.02 --> 1621.26]  him
[1621.26 --> 1623.36]  so
[1623.36 --> 1623.68]  if
[1623.68 --> 1623.98]  your
[1623.98 --> 1624.68]  deliverance
[1624.68 --> 1625.00]  is
[1625.00 --> 1625.48]  delayed
[1625.48 --> 1626.26]  just
[1626.26 --> 1626.96]  maybe
[1626.96 --> 1627.44]  it
[1627.44 --> 1627.74]  has
[1627.74 --> 1627.92]  to
[1627.92 --> 1628.12]  do
[1628.12 --> 1628.56]  with
[1628.56 --> 1629.10]  something
[1629.10 --> 1629.50]  God
[1629.50 --> 1629.80]  wants
[1629.80 --> 1629.96]  to
[1629.96 --> 1630.22]  do
[1630.22 --> 1630.82]  in
[1630.82 --> 1631.20]  you
[1631.20 --> 1633.08]  just
[1633.08 --> 1634.02]  maybe
[1634.02 --> 1634.68]  it's
[1634.68 --> 1635.14]  because
[1635.14 --> 1635.46]  there
[1635.46 --> 1635.68]  is
[1635.68 --> 1636.02]  more
[1636.02 --> 1636.26]  that
[1636.26 --> 1636.56]  God
[1636.56 --> 1636.72]  is
[1636.72 --> 1637.02]  dealing
[1637.02 --> 1637.40]  with
[1637.40 --> 1638.44]  than
[1638.44 --> 1638.82]  just
[1638.82 --> 1639.10]  you
[1639.10 --> 1641.36]  now
[1641.36 --> 1641.68]  I
[1641.68 --> 1641.82]  don't
[1641.82 --> 1641.96]  know
[1641.96 --> 1642.16]  for
[1642.16 --> 1642.38]  sure
[1642.38 --> 1642.64]  about
[1642.64 --> 1642.92]  that
[1642.92 --> 1644.12]  okay
[1644.12 --> 1644.38]  but
[1644.38 --> 1644.52]  I
[1644.52 --> 1644.68]  do
[1644.68 --> 1644.88]  know
[1644.88 --> 1645.24]  this
[1645.24 --> 1646.62]  God
[1646.62 --> 1647.80]  remembers
[1647.80 --> 1649.40]  God
[1649.40 --> 1649.64]  does
[1649.64 --> 1649.94]  not
[1649.94 --> 1650.34]  forget
[1650.34 --> 1650.80]  Joseph
[1650.80 --> 1652.04]  God
[1652.04 --> 1652.56]  knows
[1652.56 --> 1653.54]  your
[1653.54 --> 1653.98]  name
[1653.98 --> 1655.40]  and
[1655.40 --> 1655.56]  in
[1655.56 --> 1655.80]  that
[1655.80 --> 1656.38]  remembering
[1656.38 --> 1656.78]  we
[1656.78 --> 1657.34]  find a
[1657.34 --> 1657.70]  purpose
[1657.70 --> 1658.20]  and hope
[1658.20 --> 1658.68]  that
[1658.68 --> 1659.14]  nothing
[1659.14 --> 1659.50]  and
[1659.50 --> 1659.76]  no
[1659.76 --> 1659.96]  one
[1659.96 --> 1660.42]  not
[1660.42 --> 1660.76]  even
[1660.76 --> 1661.14]  death
[1661.14 --> 1661.68]  can
[1661.68 --> 1662.18]  destroy
[1662.18 --> 1664.02]  that's
[1664.02 --> 1664.22]  what
[1664.22 --> 1664.54]  Jesus
[1664.54 --> 1664.98]  taught
[1664.98 --> 1665.18]  us
[1665.18 --> 1665.64]  when
[1665.64 --> 1665.80]  he
[1665.80 --> 1666.00]  was
[1666.00 --> 1666.16]  on
[1666.16 --> 1666.30]  a
[1666.30 --> 1666.66]  cross
[1666.66 --> 1668.12]  that
[1668.12 --> 1668.30]  to
[1668.30 --> 1668.48]  be
[1668.48 --> 1669.06]  remembered
[1669.06 --> 1669.32]  by

[1669.72 --> 1670.92]  and

[1675.14 --> 1676.12]  a
[1676.12 --> 1676.44]  sure
[1676.44 --> 1676.82]  hope
[1676.82 --> 1678.18]  Jesus
[1678.18 --> 1678.54]  said
[1678.54 --> 1678.70]  the
[1678.70 --> 1678.92]  one
[1678.92 --> 1679.38]  criminal
[1679.38 --> 1679.74]  hanging

[1684.76 --> 1684.94]  day
[1684.94 --> 1685.26]  Jesus

[1730.90 --> 1731.30]  also
[1731.30 --> 1731.88]  remembers
[1731.88 --> 1732.56]  his promise
[1732.56 --> 1733.08]  to bless
[1733.08 --> 1733.88]  all peoples

[1741.10 --> 1742.02]  today
[1742.02 --> 1744.16]  notice how
[1744.16 --> 1744.80]  Joseph tells
[1744.80 --> 1745.14]  Pharaoh
[1745.14 --> 1745.66]  like it
[1745.66 --> 1746.00]  is
[1746.00 --> 1748.44]  you see
[1748.44 --> 1749.40]  Pharaoh's
[1749.40 --> 1750.08]  authority
[1750.08 --> 1751.04]  and Pharaoh's
[1751.04 --> 1751.52]  power
[1751.52 --> 1752.16]  came from
[1752.16 --> 1752.68]  the fact
[1752.68 --> 1754.28]  that people
[1754.28 --> 1754.84]  believed
[1754.84 --> 1755.54]  Pharaoh
[1755.54 --> 1756.50]  was a
[1756.50 --> 1756.80]  god
[1756.80 --> 1758.62]  that Pharaoh
[1758.62 --> 1759.20]  could give
[1759.20 --> 1760.06]  them life
[1760.06 --> 1760.86]  and a
[1760.86 --> 1761.18]  future
[1761.18 --> 1762.50]  and that
[1762.50 --> 1763.00]  life and
[1763.00 --> 1763.34]  future
[1763.34 --> 1763.86]  were tied
[1763.86 --> 1764.42]  up with
[1764.42 --> 1764.80]  the Nile
[1764.80 --> 1765.18]  river
[1765.18 --> 1766.30]  Egyptian
[1766.30 --> 1766.88]  religion
[1766.88 --> 1767.32]  taught
[1767.32 --> 1768.16]  that Ra
[1768.16 --> 1768.94]  the sun
[1768.94 --> 1769.36]  god
[1769.36 --> 1770.24]  whose priests
[1770.24 --> 1770.70]  were on

[1771.36 --> 1771.88]  payroll
[1771.88 --> 1772.90]  guaranteed
[1772.90 --> 1773.64]  the regular
[1773.64 --> 1774.38]  annual
[1774.38 --> 1775.38]  Nile floods
[1775.38 --> 1776.12]  that watered
[1776.12 --> 1776.74]  the crops
[1776.74 --> 1777.36]  of Egypt
[1777.36 --> 1778.38]  the regular

[1780.94 --> 1781.70]  control of
[1781.70 --> 1782.24]  Ra and
[1782.24 --> 1782.78]  his agent
[1782.78 --> 1783.26]  Pharaoh
[1783.26 --> 1784.22]  allowed
[1784.22 --> 1784.78]  Pharaoh
[1784.78 --> 1785.36]  in the
[1785.36 --> 1785.70]  eyes
[1785.70 --> 1785.98]  of the
[1785.98 --> 1786.34]  people
[1786.34 --> 1786.82]  to
[1786.82 --> 1787.50]  generate

[1787.98 --> 1788.52]  guarantee
[1788.52 --> 1789.64]  life
[1789.64 --> 1792.26]  now
[1792.26 --> 1792.94]  here
[1792.94 --> 1793.78]  is this

[1794.26 --> 1795.18]  jailbird
[1795.18 --> 1796.26]  Joseph
[1796.26 --> 1797.68]  standing

[1798.12 --> 1798.30]  of
[1798.30 --> 1798.64]  Pharaoh
[1798.64 --> 1799.64]  with
[1799.64 --> 1800.16]  the gall
[1800.16 --> 1800.86]  to declare
[1800.86 --> 1802.82]  God
[1802.82 --> 1803.54]  has revealed
[1803.54 --> 1804.16]  to the
[1804.16 --> 1804.48]  Pharaoh
[1804.48 --> 1805.26]  what
[1805.26 --> 1805.92]  God
[1805.92 --> 1806.88]  is about
[1806.88 --> 1807.36]  to do
[1807.36 --> 1809.34]  in that
[1809.34 --> 1810.22]  one sentence
[1810.22 --> 1810.74]  there is
[1810.74 --> 1811.54]  a major
[1811.54 --> 1812.40]  shift
[1812.40 --> 1812.82]  in the
[1812.82 --> 1813.14]  whole
[1813.14 --> 1813.70]  balance
[1813.70 --> 1814.36]  of power
[1814.36 --> 1814.98]  in the
[1814.98 --> 1815.56]  throne room
[1815.56 --> 1816.40]  of Egypt
[1816.40 --> 1818.02]  Pharaoh's
[1818.02 --> 1818.38]  dreams
[1818.38 --> 1819.16]  reveal a
[1819.16 --> 1819.56]  future
[1819.56 --> 1820.12]  over which
[1820.12 --> 1820.66]  Pharaoh
[1820.66 --> 1822.20]  cannot cause
[1822.20 --> 1823.44]  rather
[1823.44 --> 1824.14]  over which
[1824.14 --> 1824.52]  Pharaoh
[1824.52 --> 1824.90]  and his
[1824.90 --> 1825.14]  priests
[1825.14 --> 1825.38]  have
[1825.38 --> 1826.10]  absolutely
[1826.10 --> 1827.48]  no control
[1827.48 --> 1828.96]  suddenly
[1828.96 --> 1829.38]  it is
[1829.38 --> 1829.72]  clear
[1829.72 --> 1829.98]  that
[1829.98 --> 1830.42]  Pharaoh
[1830.42 --> 1831.02]  cannot
[1831.02 --> 1831.56]  cause
[1831.56 --> 1832.20]  Pharaoh
[1832.20 --> 1832.80]  cannot
[1832.80 --> 1833.28]  guarantee
[1833.28 --> 1834.28]  the future
[1834.28 --> 1835.90]  it is
[1835.90 --> 1836.30]  the God
[1836.30 --> 1836.84]  of Israel
[1836.84 --> 1838.80]  not Ra
[1838.80 --> 1840.56]  not
[1840.56 --> 1840.98]  Pharaoh
[1840.98 --> 1842.60]  the God
[1842.60 --> 1843.12]  of Israel
[1843.12 --> 1844.38]  who controls
[1844.38 --> 1845.20]  plenty
[1845.20 --> 1846.24]  and famine
[1846.24 --> 1847.52]  the God
[1847.52 --> 1848.06]  of Israel
[1848.06 --> 1849.02]  who has
[1849.02 --> 1849.60]  the taps
[1849.60 --> 1850.02]  of the
[1850.02 --> 1850.60]  great Nile
[1850.60 --> 1850.94]  river
[1850.94 --> 1852.04]  in his
[1852.04 --> 1852.42]  hand
[1852.42 --> 1855.34]  Joseph
[1855.34 --> 1856.00]  declares
[1856.00 --> 1856.52]  that his
[1856.52 --> 1856.94]  God
[1856.94 --> 1857.36]  the God
[1857.36 --> 1857.86]  of Abraham
[1857.86 --> 1858.68]  Isaac
[1858.68 --> 1859.36]  and Jacob
[1859.36 --> 1860.98]  owns
[1860.98 --> 1861.64]  the future
[1861.64 --> 1863.62]  a claim
[1863.62 --> 1864.08]  that is at
[1864.08 --> 1864.70]  the very
[1864.70 --> 1865.44]  foundation
[1865.44 --> 1866.38]  of biblical
[1866.38 --> 1867.36]  faith
[1867.36 --> 1868.62]  we see it
[1868.62 --> 1869.06]  again
[1869.06 --> 1870.04]  and again
[1870.04 --> 1870.94]  we see it
[1870.94 --> 1871.28]  when a
[1871.28 --> 1871.58]  Pharaoh
[1871.58 --> 1872.58]  400 years
[1872.58 --> 1873.00]  later
[1873.00 --> 1873.90]  responds
[1873.90 --> 1874.38]  to Moses
[1874.38 --> 1874.88]  demand
[1874.88 --> 1875.18]  that he
[1875.18 --> 1875.84]  let God's
[1875.84 --> 1876.38]  people go
[1876.38 --> 1877.00]  by saying
[1877.00 --> 1877.74]  who is the
[1877.74 --> 1877.94]  Lord
[1877.94 --> 1878.32]  that I
[1878.32 --> 1878.50]  should
[1878.50 --> 1879.08]  obey him
[1879.08 --> 1880.14]  and let
[1880.14 --> 1880.46]  Israel
[1880.46 --> 1880.84]  go
[1880.84 --> 1883.00]  and God
[1883.00 --> 1883.86]  destroys him
[1883.86 --> 1884.14]  and his
[1884.14 --> 1884.52]  army
[1884.52 --> 1885.46]  in the
[1885.46 --> 1885.98]  Red Sea
[1885.98 --> 1888.12]  we see it
[1888.12 --> 1888.38]  when the
[1888.38 --> 1889.04]  infant Jesus
[1889.04 --> 1889.72]  is threatened
[1889.72 --> 1890.42]  by the
[1890.42 --> 1890.74]  envious
[1890.74 --> 1891.28]  power
[1891.28 --> 1892.02]  of King
[1892.02 --> 1892.42]  Herod
[1892.42 --> 1894.14]  we see it
[1894.14 --> 1894.50]  when Jesus
[1894.50 --> 1894.98]  stands
[1894.98 --> 1895.80]  before Pilate
[1895.80 --> 1896.36]  and declares
[1896.36 --> 1897.08]  you would
[1897.08 --> 1897.48]  have no
[1897.48 --> 1898.18]  power over
[1898.18 --> 1898.56]  me
[1898.56 --> 1899.24]  if it
[1899.24 --> 1899.54]  were not
[1899.54 --> 1900.06]  given to
[1900.06 --> 1900.42]  you
[1900.42 --> 1901.50]  from above
[1901.50 --> 1903.72]  no matter
[1903.72 --> 1904.18]  what the
[1904.18 --> 1904.80]  history books
[1904.80 --> 1905.12]  say
[1905.12 --> 1906.46]  no matter
[1906.46 --> 1907.54]  whose hand
[1907.54 --> 1908.36]  seems to be
[1908.36 --> 1908.72]  on the
[1908.72 --> 1909.06]  levers
[1909.06 --> 1910.14]  of power
[1910.14 --> 1910.62]  in our
[1910.62 --> 1911.30]  world today
[1911.30 --> 1912.42]  you can name
[1912.42 --> 1912.96]  every name
[1912.96 --> 1913.48]  you care to
[1913.48 --> 1913.74]  name
[1913.74 --> 1915.34]  ultimately
[1915.34 --> 1916.42]  God
[1916.42 --> 1917.00]  is in
[1917.00 --> 1917.38]  charge
[1917.38 --> 1919.06]  this is
[1919.06 --> 1920.06]  Joseph's
[1920.06 --> 1920.32]  earth
[1920.32 --> 1921.30]  shaking
[1921.30 --> 1922.20]  claim
[1922.20 --> 1923.94]  Egypt
[1923.94 --> 1924.56]  shaking
[1924.56 --> 1925.04]  claim
[1925.04 --> 1926.38]  as
[1926.38 --> 1926.54]  he
[1926.54 --> 1927.16]  interprets
[1927.16 --> 1927.74]  Pharaoh's
[1927.74 --> 1928.06]  dream
[1928.06 --> 1930.38]  and God
[1930.38 --> 1931.30]  uses us
[1931.30 --> 1931.92]  to stake
[1931.92 --> 1932.68]  his claim
[1932.68 --> 1933.80]  to bless
[1933.80 --> 1934.28]  others
[1934.28 --> 1935.48]  God
[1935.48 --> 1935.96]  and Joseph
[1935.96 --> 1936.82]  work together
[1936.82 --> 1937.56]  toward the
[1937.56 --> 1938.18]  future of
[1938.18 --> 1938.70]  feeding a
[1938.70 --> 1939.38]  hungry world
[1939.38 --> 1941.22]  God's plan
[1941.22 --> 1941.98]  is implemented
[1941.98 --> 1943.26]  by Joseph's
[1943.26 --> 1943.74]  gifts of
[1943.74 --> 1944.46]  imagination
[1944.46 --> 1945.54]  and administration
[1945.54 --> 1946.82]  it is one
[1946.82 --> 1947.38]  thing that is
[1947.38 --> 1948.04]  to trust in
[1948.04 --> 1948.50]  the God
[1948.50 --> 1949.16]  who knows
[1949.16 --> 1949.50]  when the
[1949.50 --> 1949.84]  sparrow
[1949.84 --> 1950.30]  falls
[1950.30 --> 1950.96]  who numbers
[1950.96 --> 1951.44]  the very
[1951.44 --> 1951.96]  hairs on
[1951.96 --> 1952.44]  my head
[1952.44 --> 1953.40]  God also
[1953.40 --> 1954.38]  uses those
[1954.38 --> 1954.78]  heads
[1954.78 --> 1955.74]  of ours
[1955.74 --> 1957.10]  God's
[1957.10 --> 1957.66]  plans
[1957.66 --> 1958.56]  to bless
[1958.56 --> 1959.36]  all peoples
[1959.36 --> 1959.78]  do not
[1959.78 --> 1960.44]  override
[1960.44 --> 1961.16]  our human
[1961.16 --> 1961.92]  intelligence
[1961.92 --> 1962.88]  discernment
[1962.88 --> 1963.46]  care
[1963.46 --> 1964.14]  and planning
[1964.14 --> 1964.94]  but God
[1964.94 --> 1965.54]  invites
[1965.54 --> 1966.22]  commands
[1966.22 --> 1966.92]  our
[1966.92 --> 1967.50]  participation
[1967.50 --> 1968.30]  with him
[1968.30 --> 1969.14]  love the
[1969.14 --> 1969.52]  Lord your
[1969.52 --> 1969.86]  God
[1969.86 --> 1970.34]  it says
[1970.34 --> 1970.62]  in the
[1970.62 --> 1971.16]  New Testament
[1971.16 --> 1971.70]  with all
[1971.70 --> 1972.38]  your heart
[1972.38 --> 1973.28]  soul
[1973.28 --> 1974.12]  strength
[1974.12 --> 1975.72]  and mind
[1975.72 --> 1977.70]  yes
[1977.70 --> 1978.32]  Joseph's
[1978.32 --> 1978.74]  godliness
[1978.74 --> 1979.54]  shines through
[1979.54 --> 1980.06]  in his
[1980.06 --> 1980.50]  resistance
[1980.50 --> 1980.88]  to the
[1980.88 --> 1981.46]  temptations
[1981.46 --> 1982.28]  of Potiphar's
[1982.28 --> 1982.62]  wife
[1982.62 --> 1983.62]  in his
[1983.62 --> 1984.02]  faith
[1984.02 --> 1984.30]  while he
[1984.30 --> 1984.92]  is begotten
[1984.92 --> 1985.42]  in prison
[1985.42 --> 1985.96]  in his
[1985.96 --> 1986.72]  interpretation
[1986.72 --> 1987.62]  of the
[1987.62 --> 1988.16]  pharaoh's
[1988.16 --> 1988.54]  dream
[1988.54 --> 1990.30]  but it
[1990.30 --> 1991.16]  also comes
[1991.16 --> 1991.52]  through
[1991.52 --> 1992.26]  in a
[1992.26 --> 1992.70]  grand
[1992.70 --> 1993.76]  14 year
[1993.76 --> 1994.46]  economic
[1994.46 --> 1994.98]  plan
[1994.98 --> 1995.72]  that will
[1995.72 --> 1996.14]  feed
[1996.14 --> 1996.78]  a hungry
[1996.78 --> 1997.46]  world
[1997.46 --> 1999.42]  God's
[1999.42 --> 1999.86]  work is
[1999.86 --> 2000.40]  not limited
[2000.40 --> 2000.86]  to what
[2000.86 --> 2001.46]  goes on
[2001.46 --> 2001.92]  in church
[2001.92 --> 2002.26]  or in
[2002.26 --> 2002.76]  our personal
[2002.76 --> 2003.22]  lives
[2003.22 --> 2004.10]  God works
[2004.10 --> 2004.80]  in politics
[2004.80 --> 2005.54]  and government
[2005.54 --> 2006.40]  and management
[2006.40 --> 2007.30]  of the economy
[2007.30 --> 2008.28]  God doesn't
[2008.28 --> 2008.94]  just feed
[2008.94 --> 2009.36]  the poor
[2009.36 --> 2009.72]  with an
[2009.72 --> 2010.26]  occasional
[2010.26 --> 2011.16]  miraculous
[2011.16 --> 2011.86]  multiplying
[2011.86 --> 2012.32]  of a few
[2012.32 --> 2012.70]  loaves
[2012.70 --> 2013.20]  and fish
[2013.20 --> 2014.06]  but also
[2014.06 --> 2014.74]  through spirit
[2014.74 --> 2015.66]  gifted people
[2015.66 --> 2016.78]  the policies
[2016.78 --> 2017.36]  of just
[2017.36 --> 2017.84]  and caring
[2017.84 --> 2018.30]  leaders
[2018.30 --> 2019.16]  of business
[2019.16 --> 2019.56]  people
[2019.56 --> 2020.34]  of relief
[2020.34 --> 2020.72]  planners
[2020.72 --> 2021.34]  and yes
[2021.34 --> 2022.80]  even ordinary
[2022.80 --> 2023.70]  people like
[2023.70 --> 2024.08]  us
[2024.08 --> 2025.10]  giving and
[2025.10 --> 2025.52]  sharing
[2025.52 --> 2026.46]  where we are
[2026.46 --> 2026.88]  able
[2026.88 --> 2028.12]  especially this
[2028.12 --> 2028.58]  Thanksgiving
[2028.58 --> 2029.12]  weekend
[2029.12 --> 2031.44]  but listen
[2031.44 --> 2032.24]  God
[2032.24 --> 2033.34]  is in
[2033.34 --> 2033.80]  control
[2033.80 --> 2035.38]  God
[2035.38 --> 2036.38]  ultimately
[2036.38 --> 2037.12]  rules
[2037.12 --> 2037.78]  world
[2037.78 --> 2038.42]  affairs
[2038.42 --> 2039.42]  this
[2039.42 --> 2039.78]  too
[2039.78 --> 2040.08]  is
[2040.08 --> 2040.26]  the
[2040.26 --> 2040.68]  gospel
[2040.68 --> 2041.02]  of
[2041.02 --> 2041.40]  Genesis
[2041.40 --> 2041.90]  40
[2041.90 --> 2042.88]  and 41
[2042.88 --> 2044.62]  and ultimately
[2044.62 --> 2045.38]  that gospel
[2045.38 --> 2045.94]  of Joseph
[2045.94 --> 2046.56]  points to
[2046.56 --> 2047.12]  the person
[2047.12 --> 2048.12]  in the center
[2048.12 --> 2048.76]  of all
[2048.76 --> 2049.32]  of history
[2049.32 --> 2050.66]  Jesus Christ
[2050.66 --> 2051.46]  God
[2051.46 --> 2052.68]  with us
[2052.68 --> 2053.74]  who also
[2053.74 --> 2054.38]  challenged
[2054.38 --> 2055.02]  the powers
[2055.02 --> 2055.68]  of this world
[2055.68 --> 2056.00]  and they
[2056.00 --> 2056.72]  lifted him
[2056.72 --> 2057.00]  up
[2057.00 --> 2058.64]  on a cross
[2058.64 --> 2059.62]  and they
[2059.62 --> 2060.24]  killed him
[2060.24 --> 2061.74]  but on the
[2061.74 --> 2062.24]  third day
[2062.24 --> 2062.80]  he rose
[2062.80 --> 2063.16]  from the
[2063.16 --> 2063.42]  dead
[2063.42 --> 2064.56]  and just
[2064.56 --> 2065.04]  as all
[2065.04 --> 2065.52]  were once
[2065.52 --> 2065.98]  commanded
[2065.98 --> 2066.58]  to bow
[2066.58 --> 2067.00]  before
[2067.00 --> 2067.50]  Joseph
[2067.50 --> 2068.48]  so as
[2068.48 --> 2069.22]  Paul wrote
[2069.22 --> 2069.84]  to Christians
[2069.84 --> 2070.60]  in Philippi
[2070.60 --> 2071.42]  God
[2071.42 --> 2072.06]  exalted
[2072.06 --> 2072.52]  Jesus
[2072.52 --> 2073.54]  to the
[2073.54 --> 2073.96]  highest
[2073.96 --> 2074.44]  place
[2074.44 --> 2075.44]  and gave
[2075.44 --> 2075.92]  him the
[2075.92 --> 2076.14]  name
[2076.14 --> 2076.52]  that is
