[0.00 → 10.92] so this is the sixth instalment of our series on the story of Joseph at the end of Genesis and
[10.92 → 16.20] today we have quite a few I'm not going to announce the scripture readings because their
[16.20 → 20.54] selections from chapter 43 and 44, and it's going to take me five minutes just to say that, so I'm
[20.54 → 27.04] just going to read them, but it's good that they'll be on-screen and if you want to read obviously if
[27.04 → 33.96] you want to read the whole chapters please do so at home because there's stuff that will be missing
[33.96 → 40.72] but I want to just get to the heart of this story today so we begin today at 43 verse 1 through 9 and
[40.72 → 49.86] I'm just going to read through everything without any further announcement now the famine was still
[49.86 → 55.90] severe in the land so when they had eaten all the grain they had brought from Egypt these are the
[55.90 → 63.28] brothers of Joseph and Jacob's family their father said to them go back and buy us a little more food
[63.28 → 72.14] but Judah said to him the man warned us solemnly you will not see my face again unless your brother is
[72.14 → 77.68] with you if you will send our brother along with us, we will go down and buy food for you but if you
[77.68 → 84.84] will not send him we will not go down because the man said to us, you will not see my face again unless
[84.84 → 92.92] your brother is with you Israel asked why did you bring this trouble on me by telling the man you
[92.92 → 100.26] had another brother they replied the man questioned us closely about ourselves and our family is your
[100.26 → 106.42] father still living he asked us do you have another brother we simply answered his questions how were we
[106.42 → 114.90] to know he would say bring your brother down here then Judah said to Israel his father send the boy along
[114.90 → 122.30] with me, and we will go at once so that we and you and our children may live and not die I myself will
[122.30 → 129.84] guarantee his safety you can hold me personally responsible for him if I do not bring him back to you
[129.84 → 137.70] and set him here before you, I will bear the blame before you all my life so the men took the gifts and
[137.70 → 144.00] double the amount of silver and Benjamin also they hurried down to Egypt and presented themselves to
[144.00 → 152.08] Joseph when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house take these men to my house
[152.08 → 160.72] slaughter an animal and prepare a meal they are to eat with me at noon as he looked about and saw his
[160.72 → 166.44] brother Benjamin his own mother's son he asked is this your youngest brother the one you told me about
[166.44 → 175.02] and he said God be gracious to you my son deeply moved at the sight of his brother Joseph hurried out and
[175.02 → 182.34] looked for a place to weep he went into his private room and wept there after he had washed his face he
[182.34 → 190.00] came out and controlling himself said serve the food they served him by himself the brothers by themselves
[190.00 → 197.02] and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves because Egyptians could not eat with Hebrews for that
[197.02 → 204.92] is detestable to Egyptians the men had been seated before him in the order of their ages from the firstborn to
[204.92 → 211.20] the youngest, and they looked at each other in astonishment when portions were served to them
[211.20 → 217.44] from Joseph's table Benjamin's portion was five times as much as anyone else's hard to imagine
[217.44 → 225.82] so they feasted and drank freely with him now Joseph gave these instructions to the steward of his house
[225.82 → 232.08] fill the men's sacks with as much food as they can carry and put each man's silver in the mouth of his sack
[232.08 → 238.72] then put my cup the silver one in the mouth of the youngest one's sack along with the silver for his
[238.72 → 245.24] grain, and he did as Joseph said as morning dawn the men were sent on their way with their donkeys
[245.24 → 251.12] they had not gone far from the city when Joseph said to his steward go after those men at once and
[251.12 → 256.96] when you catch up with them say to them why have you repaid good with evil isn't this the cup my master
[256.96 → 261.92] drinks from and also uses for divination this is a wicked thing you have done
[261.92 → 268.90] when he caught up with them, he repeated these words to them, but they said to him why does my lord say
[268.90 → 274.22] such things far be it from your servants to do anything like that we even brought back to you from
[274.22 → 280.58] the land of Canaan the silver we found inside the mouths of our sacks so why would we steal silver or gold
[280.58 → 286.46] from your master's house if any of your servants is found to have it he will die and the rest of us
[286.46 → 293.88] will become my lord's slaves very well then he said let it be as you say whoever is found to have it
[293.88 → 300.40] will become my slave the rest of you will be free from blame each of them quickly lowered his sack to
[300.40 → 305.70] the ground and opened it then the steward proceeded to search beginning with the oldest and ending with
[305.70 → 313.78] the youngest and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack at this they tore their clothes then they all
[313.78 → 319.20] loaded their donkeys and returned to the city Joseph was still in the house when Judah and his brothers
[319.20 → 324.98] came in, and they threw themselves to the ground before him Joseph said to them what is this you have
[324.98 → 331.88] done don't you know that a man like me can find things out by divination what can we say to my lord
[331.88 → 338.52] Judah replied what can we say how can we prove our innocence god has uncovered your servant's guilt
[338.52 → 343.56] we are now my lord's slaves we ourselves and the one who was found to have the cup
[343.56 → 350.28] but Joseph said far be it from me to do such a thing only the man who was found to have the cup
[350.28 → 357.86] will become my slave the rest of you go back to your father in peace then Judah went up to him and said
[357.86 → 364.86] so now if the boy is not with us when I go back to your servant my father and if my father whose
[364.86 → 371.76] life is closely bound up with the boy's life sees that the boy is not there he will die your servants
[371.76 → 377.78] will bring the gray head of our father down to the grave in sorrow your servant guaranteed the boy's
[377.78 → 384.68] safety to my father I said if I do not bring him back to you, I will bear the blame before you my father
[384.68 → 391.48] all my life now then please let your servant remain here as my lord's slave in place of the boy
[391.48 → 397.68] and let the boy return with his brothers how can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me
[397.68 → 402.44] no do not let me see the misery that would come on my father
[402.44 → 411.58] then Joseph could no longer control himself before all his attendance and he cried out have everyone
[411.58 → 418.26] leave my presence so there was no one with Joseph when he made himself known to his brothers
[418.26 → 426.82] and he wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard him and pharaoh's household heard about it Joseph said
[426.82 → 435.08] to his brothers I am Joseph is my father still living but his brothers were not able to answer him
[435.08 → 442.96] because they were terrified at his presence then Joseph said to his brothers come close to me
[442.96 → 451.72] when they had done so he said I am your brother Joseph the one you sold into Egypt and now do not
[451.72 → 458.40] be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here because it was to save lives that
[458.40 → 464.80] god sent me ahead of you for two years now there has been famine in the land and for the next five
[464.80 → 470.92] years there will be no plowing and reaping but god sent me ahead of you to preserve for you a remnant
[470.92 → 477.60] on earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance so then it was not you who sent me here
[477.60 → 481.68] but god this is the word of the lord
[481.68 → 491.96] so as we watch what happens in Joseph's story today
[491.96 → 499.88] I can't help but think of that famous scene from Mark Twain's book the adventures of Tom Sawyer
[499.88 → 512.26] Tom Sawyer Huckleberry Finn and Joe harper stinkers rotters one and all had set sail on a raft down the
[512.26 → 521.62] Mississippi River to become pirates but without telling anyone after many days their families concluded
[521.62 → 528.84] they were lost and dead and so a funeral was planned for them on a Sunday morning
[528.84 → 536.10] at Sunday school that day all people could talk about was the three boys and after Sunday school
[536.10 → 544.38] everyone filed solemnly into the sanctuary for the memorial service as the preacher began to talk about
[544.38 → 551.46] those three lost boys he told stories so moving and so touching that the people felt pangs of guilt
[551.46 → 555.32] for not having seen such good in these boys when they lived
[555.32 → 564.36] but only their many faults and their flaws soon everybody was sobbing in grief
[564.36 → 577.40] now what nobody knows, but we do is that tom and Joe and Huck had come home, and they were hiding in the balcony to watch their own funeral
[577.40 → 584.34] but it doesn't make the moment any less wonderful and dramatic when at the end of the sermon
[584.34 → 592.34] everyone hears this rustle in the back of the balcony and then the back door creaking open and to everyone's shock
[592.34 → 598.08] the three boys come down the aisle with the whole congregation rushing to embrace them
[598.08 → 601.74] the minister shouting praise god from whom all blessings flow
[601.74 → 606.28] some stories
[606.28 → 609.28] pack a punch because the climax
[609.28 → 612.04] is something you did not see coming
[612.04 → 615.94] the villain ends up being the last person you suspected
[615.94 → 619.58] the hero you've grown to identify with
[619.58 → 622.36] and love is suddenly killed
[622.36 → 631.40] other times the climax is something you've seen coming all along, but you still sit on the edge of your seat to see that moment happen
[631.40 → 634.52] and the fact that you knew it was coming
[634.52 → 637.56] doesn't make it any less dramatic
[637.56 → 643.40] it's like that with the story of tom and Huck and Joe
[643.40 → 647.18] we're knowing the boys were alive everybody else thinking they were dead
[647.18 → 653.10] it is like that with the climax of the Joseph story too isn't it
[653.10 → 656.82] the story began with two dreams
[656.82 → 659.66] then took a terrible twist
[659.66 → 662.68] with Joseph's apparent death
[662.68 → 665.66] but we've known all along
[665.66 → 667.62] that Joseph was not dead
[667.62 → 669.74] so neither were the dreams
[669.74 → 672.14] we've known all along
[672.14 → 673.32] about the secret guilt
[673.32 → 675.58] that the brothers carried with them every day
[675.58 → 677.66] since they had sold Joseph into slavery
[677.66 → 680.46] and lied to their old father about it
[680.46 → 683.62] we have known since three chapters ago
[683.62 → 685.74] that the stern governor of Egypt
[685.74 → 687.90] before whom Jacob's sons bowed
[687.90 → 689.20] and at whose hands
[689.20 → 691.00] they were treated so harshly
[691.00 → 692.12] was Joseph
[692.12 → 695.48] all along the story so far
[695.48 → 697.80] we have known things Jacob did not know
[697.80 → 699.74] that the brothers did not know
[699.74 → 702.16] that even Joseph himself missed
[702.16 → 707.98] and so we have seen genesis 45 coming
[707.98 → 713.08] but that does not make it any less dramatic or powerful does it
[713.08 → 716.92] and it is Judah of all people
[716.92 → 721.28] Judah whose idea it had been to sell his brother
[721.28 → 725.80] who had treated his daughter-in-law Tamar so shamefully
[725.80 → 730.28] it is Judah who brings the story to its climax
[730.28 → 734.20] the hard mask Joseph had worn up to now
[734.20 → 735.86] in his dealings with his brothers
[735.86 → 740.38] finally cracks before Judah's passionate commitment
[740.38 → 742.30] to his old father Jacob
[742.30 → 745.28] and Judah's plea that he be allowed
[745.28 → 747.96] to take little brother Benjamin's place
[747.96 → 749.98] as Joseph's slave
[749.98 → 752.80] finally convinced
[752.80 → 756.24] that his brothers really had changed
[756.24 → 759.86] and no longer able to control himself
[759.86 → 763.54] Joseph reveals himself to his brothers
[763.54 → 766.60] I am Joseph
[766.60 → 769.94] and would you not have loved
[769.94 → 771.74] to see their faces
[771.74 → 774.20] at that precise moment
[774.20 → 780.18] but what makes this climax so powerful
[780.18 → 784.36] is not just that Joseph reveals himself
[784.36 → 789.40] here the main character of the Book of Genesis
[789.40 → 791.34] reveals himself
[791.34 → 796.18] here the main character of the Book of Genesis
[796.18 → 800.34] who you could argue had been missing up until this point
[800.34 → 804.66] finally also shows up
[804.66 → 807.00] god
[807.00 → 811.80] before Joseph's story
[811.80 → 814.26] god was easy to find
[814.26 → 818.12] in the beginning god walked and talked with Adam and eve
[818.12 → 819.32] in the garden every day
[819.32 → 823.88] Noah Abraham Isaac Jacob
[823.88 → 826.84] they all heard the voice of god
[826.84 → 829.30] telling them exactly what to do
[829.30 → 832.20] exactly what was going to happen
[832.20 → 835.50] but that all changed
[835.50 → 837.48] with the beginning of the Joseph story
[837.48 → 841.66] god had become silent
[841.66 → 843.94] not absent
[843.94 → 845.56] just silent
[845.56 → 849.20] in Joseph's life up to now
[849.20 → 851.10] there were no divine speeches
[851.10 → 853.76] there were no set of instructions
[853.76 → 857.58] there were no obvious proofs of god's presence
[857.58 → 861.78] when Joseph wanted to hear the voice of god
[861.78 → 863.72] he listened
[863.72 → 865.06] to his life
[865.06 → 867.46] to his dreams
[867.46 → 870.18] to the people he met along the way
[870.18 → 873.14] to the things that happened to him each day
[873.14 → 873.80] whether good
[873.80 → 874.66] or evil
[874.66 → 877.78] these were how god spoke
[877.78 → 878.60] to Joseph
[878.60 → 879.20] except
[879.20 → 881.94] that none of it made a lot of sense
[881.94 → 882.90] in bits and pieces
[882.90 → 884.86] Joseph
[884.86 → 886.70] but when his brother showed up
[886.70 → 889.44] Joseph began to see
[889.44 → 890.32] a pattern
[890.32 → 894.24] and now at this moment of revelation
[894.24 → 895.06] with his brothers
[895.06 → 895.82] Joseph
[895.82 → 896.88] finally
[896.88 → 898.68] and fully gets it
[898.68 → 900.36] the lights went on
[900.36 → 902.82] I am your brother
[902.82 → 903.90] Joseph
[903.90 → 906.90] and now do not be distressed
[906.90 → 909.28] and do not be angry with yourselves
[909.28 → 910.98] for selling me here
[910.98 → 913.80] because it was to save lives
[913.80 → 915.64] that god
[915.64 → 917.38] sent me
[917.38 → 918.50] ahead of you
[918.50 → 920.42] suddenly
[920.42 → 921.98] it's all clear to Joseph
[921.98 → 923.60] nobody explains it to him
[923.60 → 924.78] looking back
[924.78 → 926.36] now he just sees
[926.36 → 928.26] god's fingerprints
[928.26 → 930.48] all over the place
[930.48 → 933.92] his brothers clearly did not
[933.92 → 935.96] which is why Joseph says it
[935.96 → 937.10] three times
[937.10 → 937.78] did you catch that
[937.78 → 939.76] three times in genesis 45
[939.76 → 941.32] in verses 5
[941.32 → 942.34] 7 and 8
[942.34 → 944.22] god sent me ahead of you
[944.22 → 946.44] but god sent me ahead of you
[946.44 → 948.10] so then it was not you
[948.10 → 949.32] who sent me here
[949.32 → 950.40] but god
[950.40 → 954.62] although Joseph had already
[954.62 → 956.92] forgiven them for what they had done to them
[956.92 → 957.84] to him
[957.84 → 960.06] their guilt still made them
[960.06 → 960.90] afraid
[960.90 → 962.14] of Joseph
[962.14 → 963.20] after all
[963.20 → 965.84] ten against one
[965.84 → 968.30] they had thrown him into a pit
[968.30 → 969.84] to die
[969.84 → 972.78] then they sold him for a profit
[972.78 → 974.20] rather than kill him for nothing
[974.20 → 976.56] then they lied to their father
[976.56 → 977.48] about his fate
[977.48 → 978.32] all of that
[978.32 → 980.32] and everything in between
[980.32 → 981.96] and now
[981.96 → 983.84] he was saving their lives
[983.84 → 987.36] it would have been easier
[987.36 → 989.68] if he had beaten them first
[989.68 → 993.18] or made them his slaves
[993.18 → 994.26] for life
[994.26 → 996.86] they might have understood that better
[996.86 → 998.30] because that is how the world
[998.30 → 999.04] usually works
[999.04 → 999.30] right
[999.30 → 1000.04] crime
[1000.04 → 1001.38] and punishment
[1001.38 → 1003.24] do the crime
[1003.24 → 1004.46] you do the time
[1004.46 → 1006.92] retaliation and revenge
[1006.92 → 1008.18] there is often no place
[1008.18 → 1009.60] for grace
[1009.60 → 1013.82] but that's not how Joseph sees it
[1013.82 → 1016.46] when he looked at his life
[1016.46 → 1019.48] he did not see a series of senseless tragedies
[1019.48 → 1021.90] he didn't see himself
[1021.90 → 1023.04] as anybody's victim
[1023.04 → 1026.02] he saw a lighted path
[1026.02 → 1028.18] that went through a pit
[1028.18 → 1029.34] in the ground
[1029.34 → 1030.94] then down to Egypt
[1030.94 → 1032.62] winding for years
[1032.62 → 1034.34] through pharaoh's prison system
[1034.34 → 1035.32] until finally
[1035.32 → 1037.22] the road led straight
[1037.22 → 1038.38] to where he stood
[1038.38 → 1039.46] this day
[1039.46 → 1041.98] it was not you
[1041.98 → 1043.12] who sent me here
[1043.12 → 1045.26] but god
[1045.26 → 1048.48] sadly
[1048.48 → 1050.60] up to the day
[1050.60 → 1052.00] that father Jacob died
[1052.00 → 1052.72] his brothers
[1052.72 → 1054.46] never really got it
[1054.46 → 1056.62] Joseph
[1056.62 → 1058.26] remained a mystery to them
[1058.26 → 1060.98] and they never fully trusted him
[1060.98 → 1062.00] because no sooner
[1062.00 → 1063.58] is father Jacob dead
[1063.58 → 1064.16] and buried
[1064.16 → 1065.38] and they were right back
[1065.38 → 1066.02] at it again
[1066.02 → 1068.42] scheming to save their lives
[1068.42 → 1070.04] bowing before Joseph
[1070.04 → 1070.62] once more
[1070.62 → 1072.06] we read in the last chapter
[1072.06 → 1073.06] of genesis
[1073.06 → 1073.90] chapter 50
[1073.90 → 1075.90] that this is what they say to Joseph
[1075.90 → 1078.94] your father left these instructions
[1078.94 → 1079.90] before he died
[1079.90 → 1082.54] this is what you are to say to Joseph
[1082.54 → 1084.78] I ask you to forgive your brothers
[1084.78 → 1086.48] the sins and the wrongs they committed
[1086.48 → 1088.14] in treating you so badly
[1088.14 → 1090.46] now please forgive the sins
[1090.46 → 1091.84] of the servants of the god
[1091.84 → 1092.84] of your father
[1092.84 → 1094.92] now we don't know
[1094.92 → 1097.58] if father Jacob really said that or not
[1097.58 → 1100.86] but it was entirely beside the point
[1100.86 → 1102.24] because for Joseph
[1102.24 → 1104.26] nothing was beyond
[1104.26 → 1106.74] the creative power of god
[1106.74 → 1108.52] not lies
[1108.52 → 1110.22] not treachery
[1110.22 → 1112.06] not years in prison
[1112.06 → 1113.38] not death
[1113.38 → 1116.80] as terrible as all the things
[1116.80 → 1118.62] that had happened to Joseph were
[1118.62 → 1121.18] they were also redeemable
[1121.18 → 1123.76] in god's hands
[1123.76 → 1125.84] by themselves
[1125.84 → 1127.12] they had no meaning
[1127.12 → 1128.48] their meaning
[1128.48 → 1128.50] their meaning
[1128.50 → 1130.06] was what god
[1130.06 → 1131.28] and what Joseph
[1131.28 → 1132.60] made of them
[1132.60 → 1135.48] and so once more
[1135.48 → 1136.52] Joseph does not
[1136.52 → 1137.14] blame
[1137.14 → 1138.14] but he explains
[1138.14 → 1138.56] and says
[1138.56 → 1140.02] you intended to harm me
[1140.02 → 1141.44] but god intended it
[1141.44 → 1142.28] for good
[1142.28 → 1144.78] the brothers thought
[1144.78 → 1145.68] they were in charge
[1145.68 → 1146.78] of the meaning of things
[1146.78 → 1148.20] that if they meant harm
[1148.20 → 1149.08] when they sold Joseph
[1149.08 → 1149.74] into slavery
[1149.74 → 1150.34] well then
[1150.34 → 1151.70] even if they were sorry
[1151.70 → 1152.28] afterwards
[1152.28 → 1153.78] the harm could not be undone
[1153.78 → 1155.06] and their guilt remained
[1155.06 → 1157.66] the one thing
[1157.66 → 1159.30] they had not
[1159.30 → 1160.44] and still did not
[1160.44 → 1161.38] reckon on
[1161.38 → 1162.58] was the intent
[1162.58 → 1163.26] of god
[1163.26 → 1165.12] and god
[1165.12 → 1166.04] Joseph does his
[1166.04 → 1167.52] very best to explain
[1167.52 → 1169.90] is an inventive god
[1169.90 → 1171.52] god is like one of those
[1171.52 → 1172.80] genius sculptors
[1172.80 → 1173.78] who can make art
[1173.78 → 1174.50] out of anything
[1174.50 → 1175.96] give him a tire rim
[1175.96 → 1177.44] give him a wrecked bicycle
[1177.44 → 1178.62] the brass bed post
[1178.62 → 1179.90] some old duck work
[1179.90 → 1181.30] and he'll weld it all
[1181.30 → 1182.30] into an eagle
[1182.30 → 1183.86] nothing
[1183.86 → 1185.40] is too bent
[1185.40 → 1186.16] to be used
[1186.16 → 1187.46] not even tragedies
[1187.46 → 1189.68] not even bad decisions
[1189.68 → 1190.78] not even plain
[1190.78 → 1192.74] human meanness
[1192.74 → 1196.18] you intended to harm me
[1196.18 → 1196.96] said Joseph
[1196.96 → 1198.34] who was a living work
[1198.34 → 1198.80] of art
[1198.80 → 1200.96] but god
[1200.96 → 1202.44] intended it
[1202.44 → 1203.88] shaped it
[1203.88 → 1205.16] for good
[1205.16 → 1209.40] that is Joseph's
[1209.40 → 1209.96] conclusion
[1209.96 → 1211.66] as he listened
[1211.66 → 1212.90] to his own life
[1212.90 → 1214.54] and the climactic
[1214.54 → 1215.44] point and meaning
[1215.44 → 1216.94] of the whole story
[1216.94 → 1218.24] in the first place
[1218.24 → 1220.12] god's plan
[1220.12 → 1220.88] and desire
[1220.88 → 1221.60] and promise
[1221.60 → 1222.20] to bless
[1222.20 → 1222.74] Abraham
[1222.74 → 1224.66] and his descendants
[1224.66 → 1226.12] and to bless
[1226.12 → 1227.12] all peoples
[1227.12 → 1228.06] Egyptians
[1228.06 → 1228.86] and everyone else
[1228.86 → 1229.38] on earth
[1229.38 → 1230.44] through them
[1230.44 → 1232.20] no matter what
[1232.20 → 1234.36] to bless
[1234.36 → 1236.28] even you
[1236.28 → 1237.72] no matter what
[1237.72 → 1240.06] even though
[1240.06 → 1241.04] listening to our
[1241.04 → 1241.76] own lives
[1241.76 → 1243.20] doesn't always
[1243.20 → 1244.24] even usually
[1244.24 → 1244.80] perhaps
[1244.80 → 1245.44] give us
[1245.44 → 1246.08] the kind of
[1246.08 → 1246.56] clarity
[1246.56 → 1247.24] or hindsight
[1247.24 → 1248.48] that Joseph
[1248.48 → 1249.60] received
[1249.60 → 1252.24] truth is
[1252.24 → 1252.80] I think
[1252.80 → 1254.32] we probably
[1254.32 → 1254.90] live more
[1254.90 → 1255.66] with questions
[1255.66 → 1256.76] than answers
[1256.76 → 1259.28] the question
[1259.28 → 1259.58] is
[1259.58 → 1260.20] how are
[1260.20 → 1260.72] we
[1260.72 → 1262.06] to live
[1262.06 → 1262.78] with divine
[1262.78 → 1263.54] providence
[1263.54 → 1263.96] without
[1263.96 → 1265.36] such clarity
[1265.36 → 1267.30] in light of
[1267.30 → 1267.96] anything and
[1267.96 → 1268.62] everything that
[1268.62 → 1269.34] we wish we
[1269.34 → 1269.88] could change
[1269.88 → 1270.42] in our own
[1270.42 → 1270.72] lives
[1270.72 → 1272.24] but can't
[1272.24 → 1274.64] then Joseph's
[1274.64 → 1275.00] story
[1275.00 → 1276.76] and conclusion
[1276.76 → 1277.44] points us
[1277.44 → 1277.88] I think
[1277.88 → 1279.06] in at least
[1279.06 → 1279.82] three directions
[1279.82 → 1280.82] first
[1280.82 → 1283.38] it tells us
[1283.38 → 1283.92] to be very
[1283.92 → 1284.78] careful of how
[1284.78 → 1285.76] you understand
[1285.76 → 1286.76] divine
[1286.76 → 1287.52] providence
[1287.52 → 1290.18] you intended
[1290.18 → 1290.86] to harm me
[1290.86 → 1291.36] but god
[1291.36 → 1292.14] intended it
[1292.14 → 1293.16] for good
[1293.16 → 1293.60] well
[1293.60 → 1294.22] yes
[1294.22 → 1296.06] and we've
[1296.06 → 1296.78] all heard
[1296.78 → 1297.38] any number
[1297.38 → 1298.22] of variations
[1298.22 → 1299.12] on that
[1299.12 → 1299.48] theme
[1299.48 → 1300.04] haven't we
[1300.04 → 1301.90] god will
[1301.90 → 1302.52] find a way
[1302.52 → 1305.38] or the
[1305.38 → 1305.82] lord will
[1305.82 → 1306.28] provide
[1306.28 → 1308.60] or god
[1308.60 → 1308.98] will not
[1308.98 → 1309.34] give you
[1309.34 → 1309.70] more
[1309.70 → 1310.36] than you
[1310.36 → 1310.86] can bear
[1310.86 → 1313.44] platitudes
[1313.44 → 1314.46] about providence
[1314.46 → 1315.14] abound
[1315.14 → 1316.98] and the
[1316.98 → 1317.34] problem
[1317.34 → 1317.86] with most
[1317.86 → 1318.12] of them
[1318.12 → 1318.60] is not
[1318.60 → 1319.18] that they
[1319.18 → 1319.98] are false
[1319.98 → 1322.86] it is how
[1322.86 → 1323.60] people often
[1323.60 → 1324.28] say them
[1324.28 → 1326.10] with a
[1326.10 → 1326.94] knowing smile
[1326.94 → 1328.14] while they
[1328.14 → 1328.70] pat you on
[1328.70 → 1329.06] the arm
[1329.06 → 1331.16] they mean
[1331.16 → 1331.82] well but
[1331.82 → 1332.42] instead of
[1332.42 → 1333.26] feeling comforted
[1333.26 → 1333.80] more often
[1333.80 → 1334.46] you feel
[1334.46 → 1335.04] dismissed
[1335.04 → 1337.24] there, there dear
[1337.24 → 1337.80] I know you
[1337.80 → 1338.22] are hurting
[1338.22 → 1338.68] but I don't
[1338.68 → 1339.08] really want
[1339.08 → 1339.58] to hear about
[1339.58 → 1339.68] it
[1339.68 → 1340.08] the lord
[1340.08 → 1340.82] will provide
[1340.82 → 1341.90] run along
[1341.90 → 1342.60] now and
[1342.60 → 1342.98] say your
[1342.98 → 1343.42] prayers
[1343.42 → 1347.12] divine providence
[1347.12 → 1347.86] that is does
[1347.86 → 1348.62] not mean
[1348.62 → 1349.48] that we do
[1349.48 → 1350.18] not look
[1350.18 → 1350.84] evil in the
[1350.84 → 1351.66] face and
[1351.66 → 1352.12] call it
[1352.12 → 1352.86] exactly what
[1352.86 → 1353.38] it is
[1353.38 → 1353.98] evil
[1353.98 → 1356.74] in his book
[1356.74 → 1357.42] on genesis
[1357.42 → 1358.08] Walter
[1358.08 → 1358.66] Brueggemann
[1358.66 → 1359.90] talks about
[1359.90 → 1360.56] the tension
[1360.56 → 1361.12] built into
[1361.12 → 1361.64] the story
[1361.64 → 1362.30] of Joseph
[1362.30 → 1363.16] and his
[1363.16 → 1363.48] brothers
[1363.48 → 1365.10] there are
[1365.10 → 1366.28] two very
[1366.28 → 1367.24] real dimensions
[1367.24 → 1367.64] to it
[1367.64 → 1368.10] he says
[1368.10 → 1369.12] first there
[1369.12 → 1369.66] is real
[1369.66 → 1370.52] human
[1370.52 → 1371.66] jeopardy
[1371.66 → 1372.78] real betrayal
[1372.78 → 1373.66] real grief
[1373.66 → 1374.54] real weeping
[1374.54 → 1376.28] you intended
[1376.28 → 1376.96] to harm
[1376.96 → 1377.40] me
[1377.40 → 1380.20] second
[1380.20 → 1381.02] there is
[1381.02 → 1382.06] real divine
[1382.06 → 1382.92] faithfulness
[1382.92 → 1384.24] rescue
[1384.24 → 1385.08] blessing
[1385.08 → 1385.90] healing
[1385.90 → 1387.20] real food
[1387.20 → 1388.92] but God
[1388.92 → 1389.78] intended it
[1389.78 → 1390.70] for good
[1390.70 → 1392.52] emphasize
[1392.52 → 1393.28] one at the
[1393.28 → 1393.82] expense of
[1393.82 → 1394.18] the other
[1394.18 → 1395.72] and you
[1395.72 → 1396.18] missed the
[1396.18 → 1396.50] point
[1396.50 → 1397.88] because
[1397.88 → 1398.68] neither one
[1398.68 → 1399.10] is the
[1399.10 → 1399.42] truth
[1399.42 → 1400.12] all by
[1400.12 → 1400.68] itself
[1400.68 → 1403.16] it is no
[1403.16 → 1403.74] different in
[1403.74 → 1404.12] the world
[1404.12 → 1404.70] in which we
[1404.70 → 1405.00] live
[1405.00 → 1406.74] all by
[1406.74 → 1407.12] itself
[1407.12 → 1407.64] the human
[1407.64 → 1408.36] situation
[1408.36 → 1409.14] looks pretty
[1409.14 → 1409.62] bleak at
[1409.62 → 1410.06] times
[1410.06 → 1412.26] in our
[1412.26 → 1412.80] fear and
[1412.80 → 1413.06] greed
[1413.06 → 1413.46] we do
[1413.46 → 1413.92] terrible
[1413.92 → 1414.58] things to
[1414.58 → 1415.08] each other
[1415.08 → 1416.68] nations
[1416.68 → 1417.58] not at war
[1417.58 → 1418.12] with other
[1418.12 → 1418.50] nations
[1418.50 → 1419.18] are at war
[1419.18 → 1419.50] within
[1419.50 → 1420.06] themselves
[1420.06 → 1420.86] and that
[1420.86 → 1421.22] battle
[1421.22 → 1422.00] goes on
[1422.00 → 1422.42] often
[1422.42 → 1422.98] inside
[1422.98 → 1423.50] each one
[1423.50 → 1424.02] of us
[1424.02 → 1425.90] danger
[1425.90 → 1426.56] betrayal
[1426.56 → 1427.26] grief
[1427.26 → 1428.00] famine
[1428.00 → 1428.56] weeping
[1428.56 → 1429.04] these things
[1429.04 → 1429.52] are real
[1429.52 → 1429.98] and if that's
[1429.98 → 1430.68] all we know
[1430.68 → 1431.40] then we are
[1431.40 → 1431.92] doomed to
[1431.92 → 1432.40] despair
[1432.40 → 1433.04] because there
[1433.04 → 1433.72] is no way
[1433.72 → 1434.34] out for us
[1434.34 → 1435.12] under our
[1435.12 → 1435.44] own
[1435.44 → 1436.08] steam
[1436.08 → 1438.72] but jumping
[1438.72 → 1439.26] from that
[1439.26 → 1440.06] to absolute
[1440.06 → 1440.80] certainty
[1440.80 → 1442.08] about God's
[1442.08 → 1442.88] plan for my
[1442.88 → 1443.34] life
[1443.34 → 1445.06] is not the
[1445.06 → 1445.92] answer either
[1445.92 → 1446.76] not all by
[1446.76 → 1447.34] itself
[1447.34 → 1449.78] all by itself
[1449.78 → 1450.22] that would
[1450.22 → 1450.78] ignore
[1450.78 → 1451.34] human
[1451.34 → 1452.00] suffering
[1452.00 → 1453.96] and turn
[1453.96 → 1454.42] into some
[1454.42 → 1454.90] sort of
[1454.90 → 1455.36] religious
[1455.36 → 1456.44] romanticism
[1456.44 → 1457.78] that dismisses
[1457.78 → 1458.66] pain and
[1458.66 → 1459.46] doubt and
[1459.46 → 1460.20] sickness and
[1460.20 → 1461.04] grief as
[1461.04 → 1461.98] failures of
[1461.98 → 1462.44] faith
[1462.44 → 1465.10] as though
[1465.10 → 1465.56] all that
[1465.56 → 1466.30] counts is
[1466.30 → 1466.66] the coming
[1466.66 → 1467.14] victory
[1467.14 → 1469.30] can you
[1469.30 → 1469.68] imagine
[1469.68 → 1470.20] somebody
[1470.20 → 1470.86] leaning down
[1470.86 → 1471.26] over the
[1471.26 → 1471.60] edge of
[1471.60 → 1472.00] the pit
[1472.00 → 1472.60] while the
[1472.60 → 1473.48] brothers are
[1473.48 → 1473.82] busy
[1473.82 → 1474.46] bargaining
[1474.46 → 1474.86] with the
[1474.86 → 1475.48] slave traders
[1475.48 → 1476.00] and yelling
[1476.00 → 1476.32] out
[1476.32 → 1477.16] don't worry
[1477.16 → 1477.54] Joseph
[1477.54 → 1478.34] everything will
[1478.34 → 1478.80] turn out
[1478.80 → 1479.38] with God
[1479.38 → 1479.98] in the
[1479.98 → 1480.26] end
[1480.26 → 1484.12] that would
[1484.12 → 1484.42] be a
[1484.42 → 1484.72] miserable
[1484.72 → 1485.40] denial of
[1485.40 → 1485.68] God
[1485.68 → 1487.14] the God
[1487.14 → 1487.42] who does
[1487.42 → 1487.78] not live
[1487.78 → 1488.34] way up
[1488.34 → 1489.00] above us
[1489.00 → 1489.76] somewhere
[1489.76 → 1490.20] pulling
[1490.20 → 1490.70] strings
[1490.70 → 1491.82] and calling
[1491.82 → 1492.60] the shots
[1492.60 → 1495.24] but who
[1495.24 → 1495.90] lives right
[1495.90 → 1496.74] here among
[1496.74 → 1497.66] us giving
[1497.66 → 1499.08] us our
[1499.08 → 1500.82] freedom and
[1500.82 → 1501.48] holding his
[1501.48 → 1502.32] divine breath
[1502.32 → 1503.50] while we make
[1503.50 → 1504.18] our choices
[1504.18 → 1506.08] sometimes those
[1506.08 → 1506.78] choices are
[1506.78 → 1507.50] very good and
[1507.50 → 1508.70] sometimes they
[1508.70 → 1509.76] are very bad
[1509.76 → 1511.42] but either way
[1511.42 → 1513.02] God does
[1513.02 → 1514.86] not leave
[1514.86 → 1517.46] divine
[1517.46 → 1518.46] providence is
[1518.46 → 1519.20] about a God
[1519.20 → 1520.22] who is committed
[1520.22 → 1520.84] to us
[1520.84 → 1522.58] and to
[1522.58 → 1522.92] working
[1522.92 → 1523.84] through us
[1523.84 → 1526.16] it is not
[1526.16 → 1527.04] about God's
[1527.04 → 1528.34] will overriding
[1528.34 → 1529.34] our own
[1529.34 → 1531.82] as writer
[1531.82 → 1532.52] Barbara
[1532.52 → 1533.34] Brown Taylor
[1533.34 → 1534.36] put it
[1534.36 → 1535.34] it is more
[1535.34 → 1535.86] like a
[1535.86 → 1536.34] dance
[1536.34 → 1538.02] that totally
[1538.02 → 1538.66] mysterious
[1538.66 → 1539.34] dance
[1539.34 → 1540.24] that takes
[1540.24 → 1540.94] place between
[1540.94 → 1541.74] God's freedom
[1541.74 → 1542.72] and ours
[1542.72 → 1544.44] between God's
[1544.44 → 1544.70] will
[1544.70 → 1545.40] and our
[1545.40 → 1545.76] own
[1545.76 → 1547.42] in this
[1547.42 → 1547.88] dance
[1547.88 → 1548.46] she writes
[1548.46 → 1549.12] it is not
[1549.12 → 1550.36] God's job
[1550.36 → 1550.82] to keep
[1550.82 → 1551.36] bad things
[1551.36 → 1552.00] from happening
[1552.00 → 1553.26] though he
[1553.26 → 1553.64] can
[1553.64 → 1554.58] and he
[1554.58 → 1555.28] often does
[1555.28 → 1556.02] and I'm
[1556.02 → 1556.36] sure we
[1556.36 → 1556.74] can all
[1556.74 → 1557.24] name such
[1557.24 → 1557.74] times
[1557.74 → 1559.80] but bad
[1559.80 → 1560.28] things do
[1560.28 → 1560.78] happen
[1560.78 → 1562.30] brothers turn
[1562.30 → 1563.00] against brothers
[1563.00 → 1563.64] people are
[1563.64 → 1564.14] bought and
[1564.14 → 1564.50] sold
[1564.50 → 1565.14] famine
[1565.14 → 1565.86] devastates
[1565.86 → 1566.40] the land
[1566.40 → 1568.60] God's job
[1568.60 → 1569.32] and God's
[1569.32 → 1569.72] commitment
[1569.72 → 1570.70] is not always
[1570.70 → 1571.18] or even
[1571.18 → 1571.72] usually
[1571.72 → 1572.62] to prevent
[1572.62 → 1573.28] these things
[1573.28 → 1573.96] from happening
[1573.96 → 1575.04] God's job
[1575.04 → 1577.30] so to speak
[1577.30 → 1579.72] is to stay
[1579.72 → 1580.46] present in
[1580.46 → 1580.70] them
[1580.70 → 1582.18] and keep
[1582.18 → 1582.68] on being
[1582.68 → 1583.14] God
[1583.14 → 1584.10] taking the
[1584.10 → 1584.52] jumbled
[1584.52 → 1585.26] wreckage
[1585.26 → 1585.68] of our
[1585.68 → 1586.10] lives
[1586.10 → 1587.22] and making
[1587.22 → 1588.24] something fine
[1588.24 → 1588.82] out of them
[1588.82 → 1589.92] in spite
[1589.92 → 1590.46] of us
[1590.46 → 1593.14] sometimes
[1593.14 → 1594.02] it's obvious
[1594.02 → 1595.60] and sometimes
[1595.60 → 1596.16] it's not
[1596.16 → 1597.90] sometimes
[1597.90 → 1598.44] the work
[1598.44 → 1599.02] of God's
[1599.02 → 1599.32] hands
[1599.32 → 1600.28] is so evident
[1600.28 → 1600.90] you can see
[1600.90 → 1601.42] it a mile
[1601.42 → 1601.74] away
[1601.74 → 1603.24] and sometimes
[1603.24 → 1604.48] frankly
[1604.48 → 1605.00] you have
[1605.00 → 1605.38] to dust
[1605.38 → 1606.02] for fingerprints
[1606.02 → 1608.16] sometimes
[1608.16 → 1608.96] God's voice
[1608.96 → 1609.42] seems to come
[1609.42 → 1610.08] straight from
[1610.08 → 1610.40] heaven
[1610.40 → 1612.06] and sometimes
[1612.06 → 1612.48] it comes
[1612.48 → 1612.78] through the
[1612.78 → 1613.28] voices of
[1613.28 → 1613.80] strangers
[1613.80 → 1615.42] or friends
[1615.42 → 1617.74] when Joseph
[1617.74 → 1618.42] wanted to
[1618.42 → 1619.18] hear God
[1619.18 → 1621.10] he listened
[1621.10 → 1622.44] to his life
[1622.44 → 1623.48] all of it
[1623.48 → 1625.22] and what he
[1625.22 → 1625.60] learned
[1625.60 → 1626.26] he told his
[1626.26 → 1626.60] brothers
[1626.60 → 1627.74] before he
[1627.74 → 1628.04] died
[1628.04 → 1630.24] God
[1630.24 → 1631.12] sent me
[1631.12 → 1631.72] ahead of you
[1631.72 → 1633.72] you intended
[1633.72 → 1634.26] to harm
[1634.26 → 1634.52] me
[1634.52 → 1635.54] but God
[1635.54 → 1636.40] intended
[1636.40 → 1636.74] it
[1636.74 → 1637.86] for good
[1637.86 → 1640.48] so be
[1640.48 → 1640.86] careful
[1640.86 → 1641.52] how you
[1641.52 → 1642.22] understand
[1642.22 → 1643.14] divine
[1643.14 → 1643.82] providence
[1643.82 → 1645.82] do not
[1645.82 → 1646.34] deny
[1646.34 → 1647.04] the reality
[1647.04 → 1647.54] of pain
[1647.54 → 1648.00] and evil
[1648.00 → 1649.68] do not
[1649.68 → 1649.94] ever
[1649.94 → 1650.40] somehow
[1650.40 → 1651.16] suggest
[1651.16 → 1652.06] that God
[1652.06 → 1652.70] approves
[1652.70 → 1653.06] of it
[1653.06 → 1654.90] and don't
[1654.90 → 1655.48] expect God
[1655.48 → 1655.96] to do
[1655.96 → 1656.86] what he
[1656.86 → 1657.18] doesn't
[1657.18 → 1657.56] promise
[1657.56 → 1658.06] to do
[1658.06 → 1658.84] for now
[1658.84 → 1662.54] then
[1662.54 → 1663.20] second
[1663.20 → 1665.36] especially
[1665.36 → 1665.80] when you
[1665.80 → 1666.10] are not
[1666.10 → 1666.54] given the
[1666.54 → 1666.94] kind of
[1666.94 → 1667.26] hindsight
[1667.26 → 1667.66] that
[1667.66 → 1667.94] Joseph
[1667.94 → 1668.44] was
[1668.44 → 1670.74] realize
[1670.74 → 1671.30] that the
[1671.30 → 1671.76] goal
[1671.76 → 1672.48] of faith
[1672.48 → 1674.28] is not
[1674.28 → 1674.78] to seek
[1674.78 → 1675.32] God's
[1675.32 → 1676.30] so-called
[1676.30 → 1676.88] hidden
[1676.88 → 1677.32] will
[1677.32 → 1678.50] this hidden
[1678.50 → 1679.12] plan
[1679.12 → 1679.46] in the
[1679.46 → 1679.94] background
[1679.94 → 1682.10] as much
[1682.10 → 1682.52] as it
[1682.52 → 1683.08] is about
[1683.08 → 1683.54] God
[1683.54 → 1684.28] obeying
[1684.28 → 1685.48] God's
[1685.48 → 1686.34] revealed
[1686.34 → 1687.06] will
[1687.06 → 1689.56] years
[1689.56 → 1690.00] ago
[1690.00 → 1691.06] I still
[1691.06 → 1691.48] remember
[1691.48 → 1692.08] during an
[1692.08 → 1692.38] interview
[1692.38 → 1693.16] on CNN
[1693.16 → 1694.44] Robert
[1694.44 → 1695.16] Schuler
[1695.16 → 1695.62] member
[1695.62 → 1696.44] of old
[1696.44 → 1696.72] Crystal
[1696.72 → 1697.10] Cathedral
[1697.10 → 1697.52] fame
[1697.52 → 1699.00] was asked
[1699.00 → 1699.84] by Larry
[1699.84 → 1700.26] King
[1700.26 → 1702.62] why do
[1702.62 → 1703.32] bad things
[1703.32 → 1703.72] happen
[1703.72 → 1704.46] to good
[1704.46 → 1704.82] people
[1704.82 → 1707.90] his answer
[1707.90 → 1708.42] and I
[1708.42 → 1708.92] didn't always
[1708.92 → 1709.26] agree with
[1709.26 → 1709.48] Schuler
[1709.48 → 1710.12] but he
[1710.12 → 1710.46] was good
[1710.46 → 1710.88] on this
[1710.88 → 1711.58] his answer
[1711.58 → 1712.00] was
[1712.00 → 1712.98] that we
[1712.98 → 1713.40] could never
[1713.40 → 1713.68] know
[1713.68 → 1714.16] but that
[1714.16 → 1714.96] this was
[1714.96 → 1715.64] the wrong
[1715.64 → 1716.20] question
[1716.20 → 1717.40] in any
[1717.40 → 1717.78] case
[1717.78 → 1719.42] the right
[1719.42 → 1719.84] question
[1719.84 → 1720.54] is this
[1720.54 → 1722.50] how do
[1722.50 → 1723.50] good people
[1723.50 → 1724.90] respond
[1724.90 → 1726.42] when bad
[1726.42 → 1726.82] things
[1726.82 → 1727.60] happen
[1727.60 → 1731.54] sometimes
[1731.54 → 1732.52] I think
[1732.52 → 1733.86] we do
[1733.86 → 1734.16] know
[1734.16 → 1735.68] at least
[1735.68 → 1736.16] in part
[1736.16 → 1736.98] why bad
[1736.98 → 1737.28] things
[1737.28 → 1737.94] happen to
[1737.94 → 1738.22] us
[1738.22 → 1739.52] I mean
[1739.52 → 1740.12] obviously
[1740.12 → 1740.88] aside from
[1740.88 → 1741.34] the times
[1741.34 → 1742.06] that we
[1742.06 → 1742.52] basically
[1742.52 → 1743.34] asked for
[1743.34 → 1743.56] it
[1743.56 → 1744.96] do stupid
[1744.96 → 1745.36] things
[1745.36 → 1747.46] we may
[1747.46 → 1748.02] not always
[1748.02 → 1748.32] have
[1748.32 → 1748.86] Joseph's
[1748.86 → 1749.32] kind of
[1749.32 → 1749.78] clarity
[1749.78 → 1750.38] but now
[1750.38 → 1750.74] and then
[1750.74 → 1751.10] there are
[1751.10 → 1751.46] moments
[1751.46 → 1751.78] when we
[1751.78 → 1752.14] catch
[1752.14 → 1752.68] at least
[1752.68 → 1753.56] a glimmer
[1753.56 → 1753.94] of the
[1753.94 → 1754.16] what
[1754.16 → 1754.52] and the
[1754.52 → 1754.80] why
[1754.80 → 1755.18] of what
[1755.18 → 1755.44] God
[1755.44 → 1755.84] is doing
[1755.84 → 1756.14] in our
[1756.14 → 1756.38] lives
[1756.38 → 1756.70] something
[1756.70 → 1757.08] that we
[1757.08 → 1757.40] missed
[1757.40 → 1758.12] at the
[1758.12 → 1758.40] time
[1758.40 → 1758.80] but see
[1758.80 → 1759.50] only later
[1759.50 → 1760.22] a low
[1760.22 → 1760.72] point
[1760.72 → 1761.68] in our
[1761.68 → 1762.04] past
[1762.04 → 1762.50] turns out
[1762.50 → 1762.72] to be
[1762.72 → 1763.28] the moment
[1763.28 → 1764.00] in which
[1764.00 → 1764.30] God
[1764.30 → 1764.78] was breaking
[1764.78 → 1765.44] an addiction
[1765.44 → 1767.64] a great
[1767.64 → 1768.20] pain
[1768.20 → 1768.64] that we
[1768.64 → 1769.32] experienced
[1769.32 → 1769.76] later
[1769.76 → 1770.64] helped us
[1770.64 → 1771.06] to weep
[1771.06 → 1771.50] with another
[1771.50 → 1771.90] person
[1771.90 → 1772.42] in pain
[1772.42 → 1773.16] someone
[1773.16 → 1773.60] who might
[1773.60 → 1773.84] have been
[1773.84 → 1774.28] alone
[1774.28 → 1775.06] where it
[1775.06 → 1775.42] not for
[1775.42 → 1775.66] our
[1775.66 → 1776.12] presence
[1776.12 → 1777.72] a hard
[1777.72 → 1778.14] knock
[1778.14 → 1778.94] taught us
[1778.94 → 1779.24] a thing
[1779.24 → 1779.66] or two
[1779.66 → 1780.60] and we
[1780.60 → 1781.00] then helped
[1781.00 → 1781.40] a friend
[1781.40 → 1781.92] avoid the
[1781.92 → 1782.58] same mistake
[1782.58 → 1785.72] still
[1785.72 → 1788.08] because here
[1788.08 → 1788.68] we always
[1788.68 → 1788.98] know
[1788.98 → 1789.76] only in
[1789.76 → 1790.10] part
[1790.10 → 1791.92] the right
[1791.92 → 1792.38] question
[1792.38 → 1792.88] is
[1792.88 → 1794.22] just this
[1794.22 → 1795.66] how do
[1795.66 → 1796.64] we respond
[1796.64 → 1797.66] when bad
[1797.66 → 1798.24] things happen
[1798.24 → 1800.44] and then you
[1800.44 → 1800.80] think of
[1800.80 → 1801.48] Joseph again
[1801.48 → 1802.06] remembering
[1802.06 → 1802.84] that through
[1802.84 → 1803.72] all those
[1803.72 → 1804.18] years of
[1804.18 → 1804.42] grief
[1804.42 → 1804.88] Joseph
[1804.88 → 1806.12] had no
[1806.12 → 1806.92] idea
[1806.92 → 1807.76] what God
[1807.76 → 1808.14] had in
[1808.14 → 1808.50] mind
[1808.50 → 1810.54] he had
[1810.54 → 1811.30] no guarantee
[1811.30 → 1811.74] he would
[1811.74 → 1812.38] ever know
[1812.38 → 1813.00] what good
[1813.00 → 1813.66] God might
[1813.66 → 1814.22] bring out
[1814.22 → 1814.46] of the
[1814.46 → 1814.80] evil
[1814.80 → 1815.72] he suffered
[1815.72 → 1816.54] none at
[1816.54 → 1816.92] all
[1816.92 → 1819.36] but Joseph
[1819.36 → 1819.92] knew
[1819.92 → 1820.80] God's
[1820.80 → 1821.24] revealed
[1821.24 → 1821.58] will
[1821.58 → 1823.42] and he
[1823.42 → 1824.28] obeyed it
[1824.28 → 1825.24] regardless
[1825.24 → 1827.42] when Joseph
[1827.42 → 1828.04] worked in the
[1828.04 → 1828.68] household of
[1828.68 → 1829.16] Rotifer
[1829.16 → 1829.84] he was
[1829.84 → 1830.56] faithful in
[1830.56 → 1830.86] the work
[1830.86 → 1831.18] he was
[1831.18 → 1831.48] given
[1831.48 → 1832.78] when
[1832.78 → 1833.44] Rotifer's
[1833.44 → 1833.90] wife tried
[1833.90 → 1834.52] to seduce
[1834.52 → 1834.86] him
[1834.86 → 1835.96] Joseph
[1835.96 → 1836.32] said
[1836.32 → 1836.88] no
[1836.88 → 1838.50] while he
[1838.50 → 1839.00] worked in
[1839.00 → 1839.36] prison
[1839.36 → 1839.70] he was
[1839.70 → 1839.92] made
[1839.92 → 1840.54] responsible
[1840.54 → 1841.60] for certain
[1841.60 → 1841.98] duties
[1841.98 → 1842.38] because
[1842.38 → 1843.34] he lived
[1843.34 → 1843.74] with his
[1843.74 → 1844.22] God
[1844.22 → 1845.54] when his
[1845.54 → 1845.94] patience
[1845.94 → 1846.62] was tested
[1846.62 → 1847.38] he endured
[1847.38 → 1848.32] when power
[1848.32 → 1848.88] was given
[1848.88 → 1849.32] to him
[1849.32 → 1849.84] he was
[1849.84 → 1850.50] gracious
[1850.50 → 1852.84] Joseph
[1852.84 → 1853.30] that is
[1853.30 → 1853.84] obeyed
[1853.84 → 1854.22] God's
[1854.22 → 1854.70] revealed
[1854.70 → 1855.10] will
[1855.10 → 1855.94] and only
[1855.94 → 1856.64] much later
[1856.64 → 1857.06] was he
[1857.06 → 1857.48] allowed
[1857.48 → 1857.96] to see
[1857.96 → 1858.42] God's
[1858.42 → 1858.88] plan
[1858.88 → 1860.48] you see
[1860.48 → 1861.28] our primary
[1861.28 → 1861.82] calling
[1861.82 → 1863.36] as Joseph
[1863.36 → 1863.94] understood
[1863.94 → 1864.36] it was
[1864.36 → 1864.82] his
[1864.82 → 1866.28] and no
[1866.28 → 1866.76] matter what
[1866.76 → 1867.26] happens
[1867.26 → 1867.68] in our
[1867.68 → 1868.16] lives
[1868.16 → 1869.62] has
[1869.62 → 1870.12] always
[1870.12 → 1870.50] been
[1870.50 → 1871.46] and
[1871.46 → 1872.10] remains
[1872.10 → 1872.76] no
[1872.76 → 1873.22] less
[1873.22 → 1874.90] to show
[1874.90 → 1876.04] by faith
[1876.04 → 1877.28] ordinary
[1877.28 → 1878.18] every day
[1878.18 → 1879.08] obedience
[1879.08 → 1880.64] to God's
[1880.64 → 1881.06] revealed
[1881.06 → 1881.42] will
[1881.42 → 1881.86] in the
[1881.86 → 1882.16] Bible
[1882.16 → 1884.80] that also
[1884.80 → 1885.60] happens to be
[1885.60 → 1886.52] the only way
[1886.52 → 1887.84] that we
[1887.84 → 1888.98] learn how
[1888.98 → 1889.58] to listen
[1889.58 → 1890.02] to our
[1890.02 → 1890.44] lives
[1890.44 → 1891.72] and see
[1891.72 → 1892.12] God
[1892.12 → 1893.00] at all
[1893.00 → 1896.82] how do
[1896.82 → 1897.26] we live
[1897.26 → 1897.88] with divine
[1897.88 → 1898.52] providence
[1898.52 → 1900.22] in faith
[1900.22 → 1901.10] in light
[1901.10 → 1901.54] of all
[1901.54 → 1902.02] those things
[1902.02 → 1902.40] we wish
[1902.40 → 1902.70] we could
[1902.70 → 1903.18] change
[1903.18 → 1903.86] whether
[1903.86 → 1904.32] past
[1904.32 → 1904.74] present
[1904.74 → 1905.40] or future
[1905.40 → 1906.62] but can
[1906.62 → 1908.82] then last
[1908.82 → 1909.88] but certainly
[1909.88 → 1910.52] not least
[1910.52 → 1911.84] it is to
[1911.84 → 1912.22] remember
[1912.22 → 1912.82] that though
[1912.82 → 1913.44] we cannot
[1913.44 → 1914.08] change
[1914.08 → 1915.10] what has
[1915.10 → 1915.56] happened
[1915.56 → 1915.96] in our
[1915.96 → 1916.34] lives
[1916.34 → 1917.80] and we
[1917.80 → 1918.18] do not
[1918.18 → 1918.42] know
[1918.42 → 1919.06] what will
[1919.06 → 1919.50] happen
[1919.50 → 1920.08] to us
[1920.08 → 1920.50] tomorrow
[1920.50 → 1922.46] we do
[1922.46 → 1922.78] know
[1922.78 → 1923.88] what cannot
[1923.88 → 1924.92] happen
[1924.92 → 1925.44] to us
[1925.44 → 1928.00] when Joseph
[1928.00 → 1928.72] himself is
[1928.72 → 1929.18] about to
[1929.18 → 1929.48] die
[1929.48 → 1930.44] he tells
[1930.44 → 1930.88] his brothers
[1930.88 → 1931.42] twice
[1931.42 → 1932.76] but God
[1932.76 → 1933.42] will surely
[1933.42 → 1933.98] come to
[1933.98 → 1934.50] your aid
[1934.50 → 1935.44] Genesis 50
[1935.44 → 1937.96] and he
[1937.96 → 1938.46] was right
[1938.46 → 1939.50] wasn't he
[1939.50 → 1941.36] without
[1941.36 → 1942.18] discounting
[1942.18 → 1943.30] centuries of
[1943.30 → 1944.00] history between
[1944.00 → 1944.66] Joseph and
[1944.66 → 1945.02] Jesus
[1945.02 → 1947.02] more than
[1947.02 → 1947.46] anything
[1947.46 → 1948.14] the Joseph
[1948.14 → 1948.76] story
[1948.76 → 1949.66] does
[1949.66 → 1950.50] foreshadow
[1950.50 → 1951.38] that Jesus
[1951.38 → 1951.88] story
[1951.88 → 1953.78] but when
[1953.78 → 1954.30] the time
[1954.30 → 1955.84] had fully
[1955.84 → 1956.22] come
[1956.22 → 1956.90] Paul wrote
[1956.90 → 1957.46] to Christians
[1957.46 → 1958.18] in Galatia
[1958.18 → 1960.40] God sent
[1960.40 → 1960.98] his son
[1960.98 → 1962.76] at no
[1962.76 → 1963.34] time in
[1963.34 → 1963.90] history could
[1963.90 → 1964.40] it is said
[1964.40 → 1964.94] with greater
[1964.94 → 1965.86] force that
[1965.86 → 1966.92] men intended
[1966.92 → 1967.92] a person's
[1967.92 → 1968.44] death for
[1968.44 → 1968.86] evil
[1968.86 → 1970.46] they condemned
[1970.46 → 1971.36] the innocent
[1971.36 → 1972.10] son of God
[1972.10 → 1972.66] to die
[1972.66 → 1973.02] and they
[1973.02 → 1973.74] nailed him
[1973.74 → 1974.82] to a cross
[1974.82 → 1977.00] but God
[1977.00 → 1977.98] intended it
[1977.98 → 1978.72] for the
[1978.72 → 1979.56] world's good
[1979.56 → 1980.40] and for
[1980.40 → 1980.86] ours
[1980.86 → 1982.38] to make
[1982.38 → 1982.74] a way
[1982.74 → 1983.36] for persons
[1983.36 → 1983.98] of every
[1983.98 → 1984.40] age
[1984.40 → 1985.58] to be
[1985.58 → 1986.00] forgiven
[1986.00 → 1986.56] of sin
[1986.56 → 1987.70] and come
[1987.70 → 1988.22] into the
[1988.22 → 1988.66] family
[1988.66 → 1989.92] of God
[1989.92 → 1992.68] knowing
[1992.68 → 1993.16] Joseph
[1993.16 → 1994.06] we understand
[1994.06 → 1995.24] that our
[1995.24 → 1995.92] lives are not
[1995.92 → 1996.60] controlled by
[1996.60 → 1997.06] fate
[1997.06 → 1998.54] not by
[1998.54 → 1999.14] chance
[1999.14 → 2000.40] but by the
[2000.40 → 2000.86] hands
[2000.86 → 2001.76] of a living
[2001.76 → 2002.66] and faithful
[2002.66 → 2003.10] God
[2003.10 → 2004.96] knowing
[2004.96 → 2005.52] Jesus
[2005.52 → 2006.12] we are
[2006.12 → 2006.68] assured
[2006.68 → 2008.20] that though
[2008.20 → 2008.68] we cannot
[2008.68 → 2009.26] change the
[2009.26 → 2009.62] past
[2009.62 → 2010.02] much as
[2010.02 → 2010.30] we might
[2010.30 → 2010.76] want to
[2010.76 → 2011.80] and though
[2011.80 → 2012.10] we do
[2012.10 → 2012.58] not know
[2012.58 → 2012.92] what will
[2012.92 → 2013.40] happen to
[2013.40 → 2013.58] us
[2013.58 → 2013.82] even
[2013.82 → 2014.30] tomorrow
[2014.30 → 2015.82] one thing
[2015.82 → 2016.90] cannot ever
[2016.90 → 2017.64] happen to
[2017.64 → 2018.06] us
[2018.06 → 2019.26] because of
[2019.26 → 2019.76] what happened
[2019.76 → 2020.20] to our
[2020.20 → 2020.52] Saviour
[2020.52 → 2022.62] we cannot
[2022.62 → 2023.78] ever
[2023.78 → 2025.18] be separated
[2025.18 → 2026.54] from God's
[2026.54 → 2027.24] love in
[2027.24 → 2027.98] Christ Jesus
[2027.98 → 2028.96] our Lord
[2028.96 → 2033.30] and as
[2033.30 → 2033.64] for all
[2033.64 → 2034.02] the other
[2034.02 → 2034.44] remaining
[2034.44 → 2035.00] questions
[2035.00 → 2035.38] about
[2035.38 → 2036.10] divine
[2036.10 → 2036.72] providence
[2036.72 → 2038.08] well
[2038.08 → 2038.72] I like
[2038.72 → 2039.16] the way
[2039.16 → 2040.06] the first
[2040.06 → 2040.48] part of
[2040.48 → 2040.82] Genesis
[2040.82 → 2041.38] 45
[2041.38 → 2042.46] ends
[2042.46 → 2044.50] although
[2044.50 → 2044.88] we did
[2044.88 → 2045.34] not read
[2045.34 → 2045.98] these verses
[2045.98 → 2046.58] this morning
[2046.58 → 2048.62] but after
[2048.62 → 2049.12] the shock
[2049.12 → 2049.74] of it all
[2049.74 → 2051.74] wore off
[2051.74 → 2052.58] after all
[2052.58 → 2053.20] the crying
[2053.20 → 2054.50] all the
[2054.50 → 2054.82] hugging
[2054.82 → 2055.24] all the
[2055.24 → 2055.82] expressions
[2055.82 → 2056.76] of disbelief
[2056.76 → 2057.48] everybody
[2057.48 → 2057.96] took a
[2057.96 → 2058.54] deep breath
[2058.54 → 2059.66] and this
[2059.66 → 2059.92] is what
[2059.92 → 2060.54] verse 15
[2060.54 → 2060.96] says
[2060.96 → 2061.98] afterwards
[2061.98 → 2063.32] his brothers
[2063.32 → 2064.92] talked with
[2064.92 → 2065.30] Joseph
[2065.30 → 2067.58] such a
[2067.58 → 2067.84] simple
[2067.84 → 2068.28] sentence
[2068.28 → 2068.86] afterwards
[2068.86 → 2069.76] his brothers
[2069.76 → 2070.92] talked with
[2070.92 → 2071.26] Joseph
[2071.26 → 2073.26] it is such
[2073.26 → 2073.84] a common
[2073.84 → 2074.38] image
[2074.38 → 2075.24] with which
[2075.24 → 2075.68] to end
[2075.68 → 2076.36] such an
[2076.36 → 2076.94] uncommon
[2076.94 → 2077.62] story
[2077.62 → 2079.38] and yet
[2079.38 → 2079.70] somehow
[2079.70 → 2080.26] it fits
[2080.26 → 2080.60] doesn't
[2080.60 → 2081.26] it
[2081.26 → 2082.86] isn't
[2082.86 → 2083.28] this what
