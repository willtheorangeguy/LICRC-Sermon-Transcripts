[0.00 --> 16.80]  Okay, we are going to be reading this morning from the Gospel of Matthew, chapter 13.
[16.80 --> 23.20]  Chapter 13 in the Gospel of Matthew is a collection of parables, and some of them are really quite
[23.20 --> 24.72]  familiar, quite well known.
[24.72 --> 30.84]  There's a parable of the sower and the four soils into which the seeds fell, and then
[30.84 --> 35.76]  a bit later there's a parable about the weeds in the wheat field, and that will be our reading
[35.76 --> 36.76]  today.
[36.76 --> 40.50]  Now I'm going to be back here again next week, and we'll be doing another parable from the
[40.50 --> 45.94]  Gospel of Matthew, and this one from a later chapter, the parable of the talents.
[45.94 --> 51.04]  But this morning let's read the parable of the weeds in the wheat field.
[51.04 --> 53.50]  Jesus told them another parable.
[53.50 --> 59.16]  He said, The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
[59.16 --> 64.74]  But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went
[64.74 --> 66.26]  away.
[66.26 --> 71.26]  When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared.
[71.26 --> 77.38]  The owner's servants came to him and said, Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field?
[77.38 --> 80.50]  Where then did the weeds come from?
[80.50 --> 83.04]  An enemy did this, he replied.
[83.04 --> 87.04]  The servants asked him, Do you want us to go and pull them up?
[87.04 --> 92.62]  No, he answered, because while you are pulling the weeds, you might uproot the wheat with them.
[92.62 --> 95.28]  Let both grow together until the harvest.
[95.28 --> 102.28]  At that time I will tell the harvesters, First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned, and then gather the
[102.28 --> 106.74]  wheat and bring it into my barn.
[106.74 --> 111.28]  And then a bit later, also in chapter 13, we have this.
[111.28 --> 116.16]  When Jesus left a crowd and went into the house, his disciples came to him and said, Explain
[116.16 --> 120.58]  to us the parable of the weeds in the field.
[120.58 --> 125.56]  And Jesus answered, The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of God.
[125.56 --> 131.16]  The field is the world, and the good seed stands for the people of the kingdom.
[131.16 --> 134.12]  The weeds are the people of the evil one.
[134.12 --> 136.96]  And the enemy who sows them is the devil.
[136.96 --> 142.34]  The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are the angels.
[142.34 --> 147.14]  As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, so will it be at the end of the age.
[147.14 --> 151.12]  The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything
[151.12 --> 154.90]  that causes sin and all who do evil.
[154.90 --> 160.04]  They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where they will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
[160.04 --> 165.42]  And then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of the Father.
[165.42 --> 169.42]  Whoever has ears, let him hear.
[169.42 --> 176.36]  Okay, we have a familiar story here, and I would guess that most of you can kind of identify
[176.36 --> 181.76]  with it a little bit, even if you may not be into farming much.
[181.76 --> 185.32]  So we have this farmer who sows his field.
[185.32 --> 193.24]  He uses very good seed, and when his seeding is done, he sends his farm hands home, and
[193.24 --> 200.64]  then he goes home himself and lies down for a night of sweet dreams.
[200.64 --> 208.14]  But while he is having those sweet dreams, a shadow moves into that field, and the shadow
[208.14 --> 212.56]  moves back and forth and back and forth.
[212.56 --> 218.48]  I can imagine a neighbor waking up with a dog barking, and he looks out to see why, and
[218.48 --> 220.62]  he can't really see anything.
[220.62 --> 222.32]  Maybe something there.
[222.32 --> 223.32]  Not to be sure.
[223.32 --> 225.32]  Maybe a wild animal.
[225.32 --> 228.36]  And in the morning, everything looks fine.
[228.36 --> 230.68]  But it's not.
[230.68 --> 236.44]  And in a few weeks, the field is full of wheat, like it should be.
[236.44 --> 239.56]  But there are also weeds, lots of weeds.
[239.56 --> 243.20]  It's a total infestation.
[243.20 --> 247.16]  It is so terribly disappointing.
[247.16 --> 249.60]  It is infuriating.
[249.60 --> 252.28]  It is heartbreaking.
[252.28 --> 254.86]  It is so terribly sad.
[254.86 --> 256.78]  It is heartbreaking.
[256.78 --> 262.82]  Now, I imagine you can connect with that kind of experience, even if you've not been on
[262.82 --> 266.24]  a farm or done a garden for a long time.
[266.24 --> 274.64]  But I'm sure you have at some point the experience of starting something new and starting with,
[274.64 --> 279.94]  you know, high hopes and great goals.
[279.94 --> 287.64]  And then the weeds come in and they spoil that great beginning.
[287.64 --> 296.02]  A marriage begins in a day filled with flowers and candles and sweet music.
[296.02 --> 301.62]  And it could very well be that the glow of that day stays with you for the rest of your
[301.62 --> 304.70]  life.
[304.70 --> 307.42]  Or maybe it doesn't.
[307.42 --> 314.96]  Maybe over time you begin to notice those habits that you didn't notice before or the
[314.96 --> 317.00]  ones you ignored before.
[317.00 --> 322.42]  And now you find them irritating, very irritating.
[322.42 --> 327.52]  Maybe there is a buildup of tension in the house.
[327.52 --> 333.98]  Maybe you begin arguing about things, about money and about all his nights out and all
[333.98 --> 341.58]  her habits of, you know, talking with her girly friends and telling them way too much.
[341.58 --> 346.96]  There are weeds in this field.
[346.96 --> 350.00]  You have a new baby born, and he is perfect.
[350.00 --> 353.24]  He is totally perfect.
[353.24 --> 360.92]  Until the colic and the chicken pox and the fussy eating and the lessons he refuses to
[360.92 --> 366.30]  learn and the report cards that tell you he's not even trying and those new friends he's
[366.30 --> 369.00]  got that you just don't like.
[369.00 --> 371.16]  They're not a good influence on him.
[371.16 --> 375.00]  There are weeds in the field.
[375.00 --> 377.10]  Think about a new semester at school.
[377.10 --> 379.60]  Think about a new job you just started.
[379.60 --> 384.64]  Think about a house you finally could afford and you're just moving in.
[384.64 --> 390.54]  And you are so hopeful that this will be everything you wanted it to be.
[390.54 --> 395.98]  And then weeds come into the field.
[395.98 --> 400.50]  This story of the farmer and his field is so ordinary.
[400.50 --> 401.50]  So human.
[401.50 --> 404.58]  This is the human condition.
[404.58 --> 409.04]  This tug of war between the ideal and the real.
[409.04 --> 413.22]  Between sweet dreams and messy realities.
[413.22 --> 414.74]  We've been there.
[414.74 --> 415.74]  We've done that.
[415.74 --> 425.46]  Now I should point out though that there is more to this story than just disappointment.
[425.46 --> 431.50]  We have to listen to that meeting between the farmer and those farm hands.
[431.50 --> 436.80]  The farm hands are confused and they say, sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field?
[436.80 --> 438.40]  Where then did the weeds come from?
[438.40 --> 439.40]  They don't know.
[439.40 --> 440.40]  They don't know.
[440.40 --> 441.40]  And the farmer?
[441.40 --> 444.40]  He does know.
[444.40 --> 448.40]  He says, an enemy did this.
[448.40 --> 453.34]  In other words, this was on purpose.
[453.34 --> 456.96]  This was a deliberate act of sabotage.
[456.96 --> 463.76]  The farmer knew that someone out there did not like him and wanted to cause him harm.
[463.76 --> 464.76]  And he did.
[464.76 --> 474.94]  Now, of course, this being a parable, the farmer is not just a farmer and the field is not just
[474.94 --> 475.94]  a field.
[475.94 --> 483.76]  I mean, the farmer stands for God and the field stands for his kingdom.
[483.76 --> 487.70]  And God wants a kingdom that is perfect.
[487.70 --> 493.08]  He wants a kingdom where we will beat our swords into plowshares and our spears into pruning
[493.08 --> 499.84]  hooks, where the wolf will live the lamb and the calf and the lion and the yearling together,
[499.84 --> 502.10]  and a little child will lead them.
[502.10 --> 506.86]  He wants a kingdom where there is no more death or mourning or crying or tears or pain
[506.86 --> 511.20]  anymore because the old order of things has passed away.
[511.20 --> 513.90]  That's what he wants.
[513.90 --> 517.28]  God has a dream.
[517.28 --> 525.96]  Or better yet, he has a plan for a whole new heaven and a whole new earth.
[525.96 --> 533.42]  And if you listen closely to the Gospels and to the teachings of, say, the Apostle Paul,
[533.42 --> 538.22]  you find out that this kingdom has already started.
[538.22 --> 540.58]  That seed has already been planted.
[540.58 --> 547.16]  It was planted in the life of the extraordinary person who tells this story.
[547.16 --> 551.72]  It started in the life and the work of Jesus.
[551.72 --> 553.42]  The way he lived.
[553.42 --> 555.14]  The way he loved.
[555.14 --> 557.28]  The lessons he taught.
[557.28 --> 559.02]  His sacrificial death.
[559.02 --> 561.42]  His resurrection on Easter Sunday.
[561.42 --> 566.14]  That is the beginning of a whole new creation.
[566.14 --> 570.00]  It's on the way.
[570.00 --> 576.44]  And yet here too there are weeds in the field.
[576.44 --> 582.34]  You know, at the very beginning Jesus chose 12 disciples.
[582.34 --> 583.76]  How did that turn out?
[583.76 --> 590.10]  Well, one of them betrayed his master for 30 pieces of silver.
[590.10 --> 596.96]  The rest of them ran into the night when he was arrested in the Garden of Gethsemane.
[596.96 --> 602.04]  And one of them, the big mouth, he lied through his teeth.
[602.04 --> 609.94]  Telling people that he did not know Jesus, had never met Jesus to save his children.
[609.94 --> 619.78]  These 12 disciples were kind of the symbolic regathering of the 12 tribes of Israel.
[619.78 --> 628.52]  They would be the beginning, the core group in a new kingdom.
[628.52 --> 633.84]  And yet there were weeds in this field.
[633.84 --> 636.72]  And there are still weeds in the field today.
[636.72 --> 638.40]  Some of them are growing in me.
[638.40 --> 640.64]  Some of them are growing in you.
[640.64 --> 649.38]  You know, at our best we can become the hands and the voice of Jesus and bring hope and healing to the world.
[649.38 --> 655.24]  But at our worst we embarrass Jesus.
[655.24 --> 671.02]  If we could be pure, honest, unselfish, you know, no shallow feeling, no shallow thinking, no shallow commitments, then we could make a world of difference.
[671.02 --> 677.30]  The world would see Jesus in us and the world would come to know him and to love him.
[677.30 --> 681.28]  And yet that doesn't happen very much.
[681.28 --> 682.58]  Not as much as it should.
[682.58 --> 687.08]  And it won't until the end when Jesus comes again.
[687.08 --> 694.10]  There are weeds in this field.
[694.10 --> 697.86]  So what can be done about it?
[697.86 --> 703.26]  Well let's go back to that meeting between the farmer and the farm hands.
[703.26 --> 704.56]  The farm hands have a plan.
[704.56 --> 709.48]  They said, do you want us to go and pull them up, pull all the weeds out?
[709.48 --> 719.94]  And if we kind of translate that story into, you know, what they really were after, it's, he's saying, shall we pull out of the kingdom all the bad people?
[719.94 --> 727.42]  Shall we get rid of all the doubters and the drifters and those people who hang with the wrong people?
[727.62 --> 729.54]  Why don't we just tell them to leave?
[730.28 --> 734.90]  Why don't we do some good old fashioned excommunicating?
[734.90 --> 742.40]  Let's go into that field and rip and tear until there's nothing left of them and only us.
[743.52 --> 749.42]  And then the church will be pure and the kingdom will thrive.
[752.30 --> 756.00]  That's the kind of thing the servants were thinking of doing.
[756.00 --> 766.24]  And yet the master, he says, no, because while you are pulling the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them.
[766.24 --> 769.82]  Let both grow together until the harvest.
[771.94 --> 775.94]  The master knows that there is wheat in this field.
[776.48 --> 783.56]  And it is good wheat made from the best seed, the kind that can reproduce 30-fold, 60-fold, 100-fold.
[783.56 --> 787.26]  And then it becomes a blessing.
[788.58 --> 792.80]  So no, we are not going to tear this field apart.
[793.46 --> 795.52]  We're going to let the wheat grow.
[797.00 --> 800.86]  And no, unfortunately, at the same time, the weeds will grow too.
[800.96 --> 803.94]  But we want this wheat to grow.
[803.94 --> 814.20]  And by the way, those weeds that you want to rip out, there's some of them growing in your own heart too.
[815.66 --> 824.82]  And the wheat that you, you know, love so much, there's some of that growing in those people you want to run out of this place.
[825.20 --> 826.46]  It's a messy field.
[826.46 --> 832.02]  And so we're going to leave it alone and let it grow.
[832.02 --> 840.02]  You know, many years ago, I fell in love with a preacher from an earlier time.
[840.08 --> 841.18]  His name was Helmut Tulecki.
[841.90 --> 843.14]  He was a theologian.
[843.22 --> 844.02]  He was a pastor.
[844.54 --> 846.68]  And he was a master preacher.
[846.90 --> 854.72]  And as I was trying to grow into the role of preaching sermons, I read everything I could get from Helmut Tulecki.
[854.72 --> 862.38]  And there are longer sermons than we have nowadays, but he just had this wonderful way of giving life to the Scriptures.
[863.36 --> 865.86]  And one of the sermons, it was in a book on the parables.
[866.30 --> 869.10]  It was on this parable, the parable of the weeds and the wheat.
[869.90 --> 879.00]  And in that sermon, Tulecki said that we would spoil God's plan of salvation if we organize an operation, throw them out.
[879.00 --> 898.66]  And if we got rid of all those people who don't belong here, those hangers-on, those hypocrites, those wobblers, we would be closing the door to them.
[898.66 --> 907.22]  We would be taking away the chance for them to hear the gospel and take it to heart.
[909.60 --> 916.62]  We would be building a little elite of the saints, and we would become a sect.
[916.62 --> 926.22]  So, no, there's weeds in the field, and there's wheat in the field, and God says, let it grow.
[927.44 --> 935.72]  Be patient and cultivate that which is good, because there is goodness in there.
[935.72 --> 952.92]  So, all this means that our calling here is in a way not to focus on the trouble, but to focus on what is good and true and beautiful.
[953.74 --> 959.84]  Let it grow, and in the end, God will bless it.
[959.84 --> 965.56]  Now, at this point, I do want to add a footnote, or maybe a clarification.
[966.20 --> 977.04]  We should not take this parable as an instruction to tolerate anything and everything until Jesus comes back again, because then he'll sort it all out.
[979.48 --> 986.06]  We could take that to be the lesson of the story, but we should be careful.
[986.06 --> 993.24]  The Bible doesn't want us to be Mr. Throw-them-out.
[993.86 --> 1001.70]  It doesn't want to be one of those rigid, hostile, angry peoples always finding fault everywhere with everything.
[1003.90 --> 1010.94]  But the Bible does say some good things and some important things about the practice of discipline.
[1012.28 --> 1013.54]  It should be done.
[1013.54 --> 1016.58]  It should be done gently.
[1017.10 --> 1019.78]  It should be done with the goal of restoration.
[1021.36 --> 1027.78]  It should be done with deep humility, because we have weeds growing in our own hearts.
[1028.26 --> 1031.76]  We are, all of us, on the edge of serious trouble.
[1031.76 --> 1039.80]  But where there is hate, you must call it out.
[1041.72 --> 1047.00]  Where there is abuse, you must do everything you can to stop it.
[1048.28 --> 1055.10]  Where there is greed, we have to cultivate a spirit of contentment and generosity.
[1055.10 --> 1059.88]  Where there are lies, we must speak the truth in love.
[1059.88 --> 1068.28]  So God is not telling us to be apathetic here and to just let the world go by in any way.
[1068.40 --> 1068.90]  It does.
[1070.16 --> 1072.80]  No, we must be vigilant.
[1073.18 --> 1074.56]  We must be careful.
[1074.56 --> 1084.80]  But we must pursue whatever is true, whatever is right, whatever is excellent and admirable and worthy of praise.
[1084.80 --> 1092.04]  So, it's worth saying again, there are weeds.
[1092.76 --> 1095.34]  There is wheat in the weeds.
[1095.34 --> 1102.30]  And he calls us to love that wheat and let it grow.
[1102.84 --> 1111.38]  You know, we could spend whole days complaining about all the problems in the world and all the problems in the church and all the problems in the kingdom.
[1111.38 --> 1121.96]  But Jesus says, seek whatever is good and true and noble and excellent and worthy of praise.
[1125.48 --> 1133.90]  There's an old saying, and you may know it, that it is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness.
[1133.90 --> 1143.96]  And that's what Jesus is asking us to do, to light a candle or to plant a good seed and let it grow.
[1146.06 --> 1148.78]  And there may be something of that you can do yourself.
[1148.92 --> 1150.86]  There almost for sure is.
[1152.30 --> 1155.96]  Maybe there's a word of encouragement that somebody is waiting for.
[1157.10 --> 1158.80]  It could be a word that you bring.
[1158.80 --> 1164.52]  Maybe there is an apology that you really should make.
[1164.84 --> 1166.46]  And maybe you've been waiting too long.
[1167.22 --> 1169.34]  An apology that could bring healing in.
[1170.84 --> 1172.62]  Jesus wants you to do that.
[1172.98 --> 1177.32]  Maybe there's some forgiveness you need to offer to somebody who's wronged you and hurt you.
[1177.32 --> 1182.30]  And he wants you to forgive and you haven't been able to do it.
[1183.80 --> 1187.74]  Maybe you need to ask God for that change of heart.
[1188.80 --> 1189.78]  So that you can.
[1190.74 --> 1195.02]  Maybe there's a lonely soul who's waiting for friendship.
[1196.44 --> 1197.54]  Maybe that could be you.
[1199.20 --> 1205.64]  Maybe there's a hungry person who needs something to, who's looking for something to eat.
[1205.74 --> 1207.24]  There's something you can do.
[1209.80 --> 1214.38]  So Jesus invites us to grow the good.
[1214.38 --> 1218.38]  That's the point of the parable.
[1221.46 --> 1223.32]  So let me say it one more time.
[1225.06 --> 1226.94]  There is wheat in this field.
[1227.12 --> 1228.06]  It's a messy field.
[1229.12 --> 1230.32]  But there's wheat here.
[1232.38 --> 1234.62]  And God wants it to grow.
[1234.62 --> 1241.22]  You know, in most Bibles, this parable is called the parable of the weeds in the wheat fields.
[1242.36 --> 1245.42]  I would maybe suggest a slightly different title.
[1245.60 --> 1250.70]  Maybe we could call it the parable of the wheat in the weeds.
[1250.70 --> 1257.04]  And then let me ask you, where do you fit in this story?
[1259.78 --> 1261.00]  Please join me in prayer.
[1262.58 --> 1267.88]  Dear Lord, we are also aware that we live in a messy world.
[1267.88 --> 1280.00]  And that so often our fondest hopes and our highest goals somehow get spoiled with weeds, with disappointment.
[1281.48 --> 1286.38]  And yet, Lord, you call us to pursue all that is good and true and noble and beautiful.
[1287.18 --> 1291.54]  And we ask you that you'll give us the heart and the will to always be doing that.
[1291.62 --> 1294.16]  And we pray it in Jesus' name and for his sake.
[1294.74 --> 1295.14]  Amen.
[1295.14 --> 1295.28]  Amen.
