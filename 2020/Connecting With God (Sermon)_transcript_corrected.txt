[0.00 → 3.90] Well, good morning again.
[4.78 → 5.86] It's good to be with you.
[6.94 → 9.06] Over the summer at New Life,
[9.16 → 11.46] we spent some time in the letter of James.
[11.72 → 13.12] And so this morning,
[13.32 → 14.90] I want to share with you
[14.90 → 18.08] some of the exploration we did
[18.08 → 19.60] in the letter of James
[19.60 → 20.70] in the back of the New Testament.
[23.88 → 25.12] In that letter,
[25.12 → 30.08] James emphasizes a fully engaged faith.
[30.18 → 30.94] A lot of times,
[32.00 → 34.02] scholars debate
[34.02 → 36.00] whether James is talking about faith
[36.00 → 37.94] or whether he's talking about works.
[38.16 → 41.24] But really, James is putting the two together.
[41.78 → 47.14] And he wants us to live out our faith
[47.14 → 49.36] in every aspect of our lives.
[49.42 → 51.40] And so we called the series All In.
[51.40 → 57.02] That when we say we profess Jesus as our Saviour,
[57.32 → 59.92] it has to be an all-in faith.
[61.46 → 64.32] But an all-in faith requires
[64.32 → 66.90] a deep connection with God.
[68.32 → 71.70] Otherwise, faith just gradually fades.
[71.80 → 73.34] And I think that's one of the dangers
[73.34 → 75.54] in this pandemic situation
[75.54 → 77.06] that we find ourselves in,
[77.14 → 79.40] that when we lose connection,
[79.40 → 82.02] faith fades.
[85.24 → 88.22] Perhaps you've heard of the theory
[88.22 → 89.98] that you can be connected
[89.98 → 92.22] to anybody on this planet
[92.22 → 95.46] by six social associations.
[95.70 → 96.54] You ever heard of that theory?
[97.82 → 99.28] By six steps,
[99.46 → 102.56] you could connect with anybody,
[102.68 → 103.72] even across the world,
[103.86 → 105.02] somebody you don't even know.
[105.02 → 107.78] So some time ago,
[107.96 → 111.16] a German newspaper wanted to test that theory.
[112.74 → 116.16] So they took a fellow by the name of Salah Bengali.
[116.68 → 119.32] He was an Iraqi immigrant living in Germany
[119.32 → 120.78] selling falafels.
[122.38 → 124.94] But Salah Bengali wanted to be connected
[124.94 → 126.42] to Marlon Brando.
[126.54 → 127.66] So the newspaper said,
[127.76 → 129.16] all right, we'll connect you.
[129.16 → 131.14] And they did.
[131.88 → 135.10] And they did it in six social steps.
[135.28 → 135.98] Here's how it went.
[137.38 → 140.70] Salah Bengali had a friend in California
[140.70 → 144.20] who works in the same company as Ken Carson.
[144.86 → 148.16] Ken Carson was the boyfriend of Michelle Bevan.
[149.06 → 151.52] Michelle Bevan was the sorority sister
[151.52 → 152.82] to Christina Outer.
[153.34 → 156.70] Christina Outer was the daughter of Patrick Palmer,
[156.70 → 159.30] the producer of Don Juan DeMarco,
[159.42 → 162.62] the movie in which Marlon Brando starred.
[164.02 → 165.46] In six steps,
[166.24 → 168.02] Salah Bengali, Iraqi immigrant,
[168.32 → 170.42] was connected to Marlon Brando.
[171.70 → 174.72] Unfortunately, Marlon Brando never returned
[174.72 → 176.80] any of Salah Bengali's calls.
[178.10 → 179.70] Now, you might understand that
[179.70 → 182.34] because all of these social associations
[182.34 → 185.20] seem rather flimsy, in fact.
[185.20 → 187.66] And so you go, well, that's not surprising.
[187.92 → 188.26] Why?
[188.82 → 191.38] Why would Marlon Brando pay attention?
[192.66 → 194.86] And yet, a lot of times,
[195.22 → 199.86] that's how we depend on our connection to God.
[200.16 → 203.24] Simply by easy social associations.
[204.12 → 206.12] I mean, going to church can even be
[206.12 → 208.98] that kind of easy social association.
[209.22 → 210.22] Am I connected to God?
[210.36 → 211.72] Yeah, I went to church on Sunday.
[211.72 → 215.72] Or, I'm connected to God.
[216.12 → 218.30] I watched the service on TV.
[221.50 → 223.14] In chapter 5,
[223.52 → 224.78] James offers,
[225.10 → 226.68] at the conclusion of his letter,
[227.40 → 229.76] James, after instructing the people
[229.76 → 232.48] on integrating their faith
[232.48 → 235.20] with the entirety of their lives,
[235.20 → 237.62] then at the end of his letter,
[238.00 → 241.20] James concludes with two ways
[241.20 → 244.44] in which we need to stay connected to God.
[244.58 → 248.58] And those two ways serve as roots
[248.58 → 252.24] that build a bridge to God.
[252.24 → 256.90] The first that James talks about
[256.90 → 260.68] is learning to live in the light of eternity.
[263.02 → 265.70] And so James writes,
[266.74 → 268.18] at the end of his letter,
[268.84 → 270.82] James chapter 5, verse 7 and 8,
[270.82 → 297.62] It's amazing encouragement, really.
[297.62 → 302.08] Amazing encouragement even for us in this time.
[302.76 → 304.58] The Christians to whom James was writing
[304.58 → 308.08] were confronting and facing
[308.08 → 310.18] a lot of trial and hardship.
[312.98 → 316.64] And so we find ourselves in new circumstances as well
[316.64 → 317.18] that we say,
[317.34 → 319.72] Wow, life hasn't been this difficult for us
[319.72 → 321.62] in a long time, or if ever.
[321.62 → 324.64] And in a sense,
[325.06 → 326.92] what James is doing here
[326.92 → 328.44] at the end of his letter
[328.44 → 330.64] is returning to the beginning of his letter
[330.64 → 332.84] where he makes this outrageous statement.
[332.98 → 334.42] This is how he begins his letter.
[334.54 → 334.94] He says,
[335.58 → 337.38] Consider it pure joy,
[337.46 → 338.54] my brothers and sisters,
[340.18 → 342.60] whenever you face trials of many kinds.
[343.26 → 344.38] Whatever we're facing,
[345.16 → 346.92] consider it pure joy
[346.92 → 350.30] because it strengthens our faith
[350.30 → 352.20] through that perseverance
[352.20 → 353.28] that is required,
[353.50 → 357.24] that kind of prevailing with God
[357.24 → 358.98] to pursue faith.
[362.18 → 364.56] Our connection with God
[364.56 → 366.98] is sustained then
[366.98 → 369.40] not by our circumstances,
[370.04 → 372.02] which is why James can say,
[372.22 → 373.66] consider it pure joy
[373.66 → 375.10] in the midst of any hardship
[375.10 → 376.36] that you face.
[377.78 → 380.02] But our connection to God
[380.02 → 381.54] is sustained by the hope
[381.54 → 382.30] that we have
[382.30 → 383.98] in Christ's return.
[384.16 → 384.92] Be patient.
[385.42 → 386.84] The Lord is coming back.
[389.02 → 391.30] And that's when He will make all things new
[391.30 → 393.34] and make all things right.
[394.86 → 396.54] And that's the view of eternity
[396.54 → 397.60] that we profess.
[399.26 → 400.98] And it's contrasted in James
[400.98 → 403.02] with two other scenarios
[403.02 → 404.80] that James presents
[404.80 → 406.32] to help us understand
[406.32 → 407.10] the importance
[407.10 → 408.90] of learning to live
[408.90 → 410.64] in the light of eternity.
[411.24 → 412.18] The first scenario
[412.18 → 414.26] is back in chapter 4,
[414.32 → 416.10] at the end of chapter 4, in fact,
[417.08 → 418.66] where he characterizes
[418.66 → 420.24] people who make plans
[420.24 → 421.34] assuming they're in control.
[421.60 → 422.96] And James, I'm warning you,
[423.06 → 424.00] James hits hard.
[424.38 → 425.42] So this is what he says.
[426.44 → 427.92] Now listen, you who say
[427.92 → 429.00] today or tomorrow
[429.00 → 430.48] we'll go to this or that city
[430.48 → 431.60] and spend a year here,
[431.60 → 433.12] carry on business
[433.12 → 434.26] and make money there.
[434.38 → 435.72] Why, you don't even know
[435.72 → 437.60] what will happen tomorrow.
[437.80 → 438.60] What is your life?
[438.76 → 440.20] You are a mist
[440.20 → 442.12] that appears for a little while
[442.12 → 442.96] and then vanishes.
[443.26 → 444.92] Instead, you ought to say,
[445.38 → 446.46] if it is the Lord's will,
[446.60 → 448.38] we'll live and do this or that.
[453.38 → 454.88] James is addressing people
[454.88 → 456.86] who thought that they had life
[456.86 → 458.00] all under control,
[458.00 → 459.74] that they were living life
[459.74 → 461.14] on their own.
[461.60 → 463.16] And James' point is,
[463.56 → 466.14] you cannot stay connected to God
[466.14 → 468.98] if you think you own your life.
[471.76 → 473.00] It's like this.
[475.10 → 478.74] Imagine that we could enjoy
[478.74 → 480.26] international travel again.
[480.26 → 483.46] And I get so excited about this
[483.46 → 485.88] that I spend just a ton of money
[485.88 → 488.58] on planning a great vacation
[488.58 → 489.56] for my wife and I.
[490.14 → 493.50] And I plan this thing out beautifully,
[493.72 → 494.26] which is funny
[494.26 → 495.34] because I don't plan anything.
[495.60 → 499.10] But I plan this amazing vacation.
[499.30 → 500.86] It's going to be a great getaway.
[501.06 → 502.44] And on the morning of our departure,
[502.62 → 504.18] I get up, I jump out,
[504.44 → 505.56] and I say to my wife,
[505.62 → 506.18] are you ready?
[506.28 → 506.84] This is going to be
[506.84 → 508.22] the best vacation ever.
[508.22 → 508.62] Ever.
[509.02 → 511.26] And she looks at me stunned
[511.26 → 513.04] because she doesn't know
[513.04 → 513.64] anything about it
[513.64 → 514.72] because I never told her.
[515.26 → 516.96] And she is offended
[516.96 → 518.76] that I never consulted with her.
[520.46 → 521.98] And then I'm offended
[521.98 → 524.00] because she doesn't want
[524.00 → 525.40] to bless my plans.
[527.50 → 528.44] Now, honest,
[528.62 → 529.72] that's just a purely
[529.72 → 530.98] hypothetical situation.
[532.32 → 534.88] But that's sometimes
[534.88 → 537.98] how we interact with God,
[538.04 → 538.48] isn't it?
[540.08 → 541.92] That we make all of our plans.
[542.04 → 543.28] We think we're in control
[543.28 → 544.30] of our lives.
[544.52 → 546.90] And then we fire up a prayer to God
[546.90 → 548.26] and we wonder why
[548.26 → 549.62] He doesn't bless our plans.
[551.06 → 552.20] Because we've not been
[552.20 → 553.28] connected to Him.
[553.28 → 559.60] So that's the first scenario
[559.60 → 562.08] that James warns against.
[562.98 → 564.72] You are not in control
[564.72 → 565.38] of your life.
[565.54 → 566.54] Learn to live
[566.54 → 568.46] in the light of eternity.
[568.74 → 569.84] The second scenario
[569.84 → 570.64] he presents
[570.64 → 571.92] immediately follows that
[571.92 → 573.44] at the beginning of chapter 5
[573.44 → 574.80] where he writes this.
[574.92 → 575.62] Now listen.
[575.86 → 577.18] So same phrase again
[577.18 → 578.78] as the first scenario.
[578.94 → 579.54] Now listen,
[579.68 → 580.20] you who say.
[580.74 → 581.76] Chapter 5, verse 1.
[581.76 → 583.48] Now listen, you rich people.
[583.80 → 584.64] Weep and wail
[584.64 → 585.60] because of the misery
[585.60 → 586.74] that is coming on you.
[587.56 → 587.96] Be careful.
[588.18 → 588.84] He hits hard.
[589.34 → 590.52] Your wealth has rotted.
[590.70 → 591.60] Your moths have eaten
[591.60 → 592.32] your clothes.
[593.08 → 594.08] Your gold and silver
[594.08 → 594.82] are corroded.
[596.16 → 597.20] Their corrosion
[597.20 → 598.64] will testify against you.
[598.76 → 600.04] Eat your flesh like fire.
[600.20 → 601.28] You've hoarded wealth
[601.28 → 602.20] in the last days.
[602.36 → 603.12] Look, the wages
[603.12 → 604.28] that you failed to pay
[604.28 → 604.86] the workers
[604.86 → 606.34] who moved your fields
[606.34 → 607.76] are crying out against you.
[608.02 → 609.70] The cries of the harvesters
[609.70 → 610.56] have reached the ears
[610.56 → 611.38] of the Lord Almighty.
[611.38 → 612.80] You've lived on earth
[612.80 → 614.54] in luxury and self-indulgence.
[614.68 → 615.72] You've fattened yourselves
[615.72 → 616.70] in the day of slaughter.
[617.06 → 617.74] You've condemned
[617.74 → 618.52] and murdered
[618.52 → 619.70] the innocent one
[619.70 → 621.22] who was not opposing you.
[623.14 → 624.68] And here James characterizes
[624.68 → 626.46] people who oppress others
[626.46 → 628.06] for their own gain.
[629.22 → 630.38] And I suspect that
[630.38 → 631.78] James isn't necessarily
[631.78 → 632.94] targeting the people
[632.94 → 634.54] to whom he's actually writing
[634.54 → 636.06] because they likely
[636.06 → 637.14] weren't the rich
[637.14 → 638.38] and wealthy people.
[638.38 → 640.80] But the condemnation
[640.80 → 641.66] of such people,
[641.76 → 642.88] the judgment upon
[642.88 → 643.74] such people,
[644.74 → 645.92] isn't so much
[645.92 → 647.38] to point them out
[647.38 → 648.88] as it is to create
[648.88 → 649.54] a background
[649.54 → 650.88] for the real point.
[650.96 → 651.72] And the real point
[651.72 → 653.00] that James is trying to make
[653.00 → 654.20] is that with a view
[654.20 → 655.02] to eternity,
[655.44 → 656.72] you not only can endure
[656.72 → 657.32] hardship,
[657.78 → 659.16] but you can also endure
[659.16 → 659.86] the hardship
[659.86 → 661.48] of that kind of oppression
[661.48 → 663.14] that people place
[663.14 → 663.96] upon you
[663.96 → 665.38] or that circumstances
[665.38 → 666.80] place upon you
[666.80 → 668.90] and the assurance
[668.90 → 670.02] that God
[670.02 → 671.48] will make it right,
[672.04 → 672.66] not you.
[674.50 → 675.24] In other words,
[675.44 → 676.42] waiting patiently
[676.42 → 677.58] for the Lord's coming
[677.58 → 678.56] reminds us
[678.56 → 679.46] of those two
[679.46 → 680.56] critical things
[680.56 → 681.84] that one,
[681.94 → 683.18] we are not in control,
[683.36 → 684.14] we do not own
[684.14 → 684.92] our own lives,
[685.58 → 686.22] and two,
[686.58 → 687.72] when we are mistreated
[687.72 → 689.00] or when we think
[689.00 → 690.96] we're suffering hardship,
[691.58 → 693.78] God will set things right.
[694.78 → 696.24] So living in the light
[696.24 → 697.00] of eternity
[697.00 → 698.58] solidly roots
[698.58 → 700.48] our connection to God
[700.48 → 701.68] no matter what
[701.68 → 702.46] the circumstances
[702.46 → 704.78] of our life are.
[705.66 → 706.58] Maybe you're familiar
[706.58 → 708.08] with Francis Chan,
[708.20 → 709.46] his teaching on eternity.
[711.08 → 712.48] Francis Chan brings
[712.48 → 714.68] this impossible length
[714.68 → 716.42] of thick white rope
[716.42 → 717.48] on stage,
[717.68 → 718.88] and it just coils
[718.88 → 719.90] around and round
[719.90 → 721.20] with no apparent beginning
[721.20 → 722.56] and no apparent end,
[722.56 → 725.90] and then he points out
[725.90 → 726.88] that in the middle
[726.88 → 727.88] of this impossible
[727.88 → 729.32] length of rope,
[729.72 → 731.22] there is a one inch
[731.22 → 732.42] little piece
[732.42 → 733.28] of the rope
[733.28 → 734.38] that is red.
[735.48 → 736.42] Francis Chan says,
[737.26 → 738.02] that one inch
[738.02 → 739.54] piece of red rope
[739.54 → 741.06] is your life
[741.06 → 741.78] in the midst
[741.78 → 742.50] of eternity.
[743.28 → 744.28] It's a great picture
[744.28 → 745.22] I think as well
[745.22 → 746.38] to illustrate
[746.38 → 747.88] James' point here,
[747.88 → 750.48] that we can spend
[750.48 → 752.02] so much time
[752.02 → 753.10] concentrating on
[753.10 → 754.32] our one-inch span
[754.32 → 755.10] of life
[755.10 → 757.16] when there's a whole
[757.16 → 758.48] eternity in which
[758.48 → 759.92] we can live.
[760.24 → 761.16] An eternity
[761.16 → 762.60] that assures us
[762.60 → 763.92] that God
[763.92 → 765.84] will give us life
[765.84 → 767.44] and that God
[767.44 → 768.08] will supply
[768.08 → 769.60] all that we need
[769.60 → 770.66] and that God
[770.66 → 771.54] will provide
[771.54 → 773.28] for every circumstance
[773.28 → 774.72] of our life.
[775.42 → 776.76] That is our
[776.76 → 777.64] solid hope.
[779.86 → 780.34] And so that's
[780.34 → 781.40] on the one bank
[781.40 → 782.98] of what roots us
[782.98 → 783.90] in our connection
[783.90 → 784.70] to God.
[785.16 → 786.46] On one side
[786.46 → 788.84] is that rootedness
[788.84 → 789.48] of learning
[789.48 → 790.26] to live
[790.26 → 790.86] in the light
[790.86 → 791.56] of eternity.
[791.82 → 792.98] On the other side,
[793.24 → 793.90] we're rooted
[793.90 → 794.86] in our connection
[794.86 → 795.66] to God
[795.66 → 796.28] by prayer.
[797.78 → 799.14] Learning to live
[799.14 → 799.94] in the context
[799.94 → 800.72] of prayer.
[800.72 → 801.16] And so,
[801.46 → 802.34] at the very end
[802.34 → 803.44] of James' letter,
[803.56 → 804.34] he says this,
[805.16 → 806.12] Is anyone among you
[806.12 → 806.82] in trouble?
[807.80 → 808.52] Verse 13,
[809.12 → 810.00] Is anyone among you
[810.00 → 810.48] in trouble?
[810.78 → 811.56] Let them pray.
[812.10 → 813.00] Is anyone happy?
[813.46 → 814.04] Let them sing
[814.04 → 815.38] songs of praise,
[815.68 → 816.50] a form of prayer.
[817.36 → 818.44] Is anyone among you
[818.44 → 818.86] sick?
[818.94 → 820.04] Let them call the elders
[820.04 → 820.80] of the church
[820.80 → 822.12] to pray over them
[822.12 → 823.56] and anoint them
[823.56 → 824.00] with oil
[824.00 → 824.92] in the name of the Lord.
[825.58 → 826.22] And the prayer
[826.22 → 827.20] offered in faith
[827.20 → 828.36] will make them well.
[829.04 → 830.08] The Lord will raise
[830.08 → 830.60] them up.
[831.00 → 831.90] If they have sinned,
[831.98 → 832.80] they will be forgiven.
[832.98 → 833.22] Therefore,
[833.42 → 834.50] confess your sins
[834.50 → 835.16] to each other
[835.16 → 837.22] and pray for each other
[837.22 → 838.56] so that you may be healed.
[839.18 → 841.08] The prayer of a righteous person
[841.08 → 842.34] is powerful
[842.34 → 843.58] and effective.
[846.28 → 847.42] It's in fact
[847.42 → 849.42] the way that Jesus taught us
[849.42 → 850.14] to pray.
[850.90 → 851.42] Ask
[851.42 → 853.42] and you will receive.
[855.72 → 857.12] The thing is,
[857.12 → 860.68] we've been taught to pray
[860.68 → 862.42] by the likes of
[862.42 → 863.74] Sir Isaac Newton
[863.74 → 865.84] and company of scientists
[865.84 → 867.92] who have firmly established us
[867.92 → 869.68] in the scientific method.
[869.68 → 871.02] The scientific method
[871.02 → 872.14] can be summarized
[872.14 → 872.92] in this way,
[873.00 → 873.48] I suppose.
[875.38 → 876.64] The scientific method
[876.64 → 878.26] is a faith commitment
[878.26 → 879.26] that assumes
[879.26 → 883.02] that only real things
[883.02 → 884.46] can be proven.
[884.46 → 887.00] And that which is proven
[887.00 → 888.78] is only that
[888.78 → 889.80] which is seen.
[890.02 → 891.06] And only that
[891.06 → 892.14] which is seen
[892.14 → 894.18] is what is real.
[894.18 → 898.66] And that ends up
[898.66 → 900.00] being a closed universe.
[900.54 → 902.70] A pretty tightly packed
[902.70 → 903.60] in universe
[903.60 → 904.76] that says
[904.76 → 906.68] this is all
[906.68 → 907.78] that there is.
[909.72 → 910.96] And then it's
[910.96 → 912.44] a struggle for us
[912.44 → 913.10] to pray
[913.10 → 914.86] in that kind
[914.86 → 916.02] of closed universe.
[917.72 → 918.08] And so,
[918.30 → 918.76] I admit,
[918.96 → 920.10] and perhaps you struggle
[920.10 → 921.14] with the same thing,
[921.14 → 923.42] to think that
[923.42 → 924.66] prayer actually
[924.66 → 925.52] is effective
[925.52 → 927.36] because what can word
[927.36 → 928.18] do against
[928.18 → 929.58] the laws of nature
[929.58 → 930.90] which are otherwise
[930.90 → 932.50] perfectly explainable?
[934.50 → 936.04] We struggle with thinking
[936.04 → 937.44] that prayer is no use
[937.44 → 938.72] or that wondering
[938.72 → 940.88] if prayer really works.
[942.10 → 943.92] But James reminds us here
[943.92 → 946.00] that prayer is real
[946.00 → 947.32] in the asking.
[948.64 → 950.32] Here's what he says,
[950.32 → 951.10] at the beginning
[951.10 → 951.76] of his letter
[951.76 → 953.10] he starts out with
[953.10 → 954.54] in chapter 1
[954.54 → 954.92] he says,
[955.08 → 955.94] if you lack wisdom
[955.94 → 957.18] ask God.
[957.90 → 958.60] Ask God
[958.60 → 959.60] and He'll give it to you.
[960.54 → 961.50] In chapter 4
[961.50 → 962.04] he says,
[962.42 → 962.64] look,
[962.98 → 963.46] you guys,
[963.86 → 964.68] you ask
[964.68 → 967.10] and you don't receive
[967.10 → 968.04] because you don't
[968.04 → 969.98] or you don't have
[969.98 → 971.68] because you don't ask God.
[973.24 → 974.88] As if James is recalling
[974.88 → 976.00] Jesus' own words
[976.00 → 977.38] which is quite likely,
[978.12 → 978.64] ask
[978.64 → 980.60] and you will receive.
[982.46 → 983.24] In other words,
[983.86 → 984.60] what James is trying
[984.60 → 985.18] to get across
[985.18 → 986.58] is that the realness
[986.58 → 987.44] of prayer,
[988.30 → 989.56] effectiveness of prayer
[989.56 → 990.58] is not that you'll get
[990.58 → 991.40] what you want
[991.40 → 992.36] when you utter
[992.36 → 993.42] something up to God.
[993.42 → 996.20] But that when we pray,
[997.04 → 999.16] God really listens.
[1000.50 → 1002.72] That's the reality of prayer.
[1003.48 → 1004.86] That when we pray,
[1005.36 → 1006.80] God listens.
[1006.80 → 1008.32] He hears
[1008.32 → 1010.68] and He responds.
[1012.24 → 1013.80] So prayer is powerful
[1013.80 → 1015.16] and it's effective
[1015.16 → 1016.80] but not because
[1016.80 → 1017.82] by it
[1017.82 → 1019.56] you get to gain control
[1019.56 → 1020.04] somehow
[1020.04 → 1021.38] of your life again.
[1022.78 → 1023.68] Prayer is effective
[1023.68 → 1025.64] but not simply because
[1025.64 → 1026.88] we get the outcome
[1026.88 → 1027.64] we want.
[1029.26 → 1029.68] Prayer
[1029.68 → 1031.14] is about connecting
[1031.14 → 1032.16] to God.
[1032.16 → 1032.20] God.
[1033.90 → 1034.66] And so we pray
[1034.66 → 1035.90] not just so that
[1035.90 → 1037.42] God can help us out
[1037.42 → 1038.88] as if He is some kind
[1038.88 → 1039.60] of magician
[1039.60 → 1040.58] for us.
[1041.56 → 1042.78] James warns against that.
[1042.86 → 1044.28] He says in chapter 4,
[1044.38 → 1044.64] he says,
[1044.76 → 1045.70] when you ask,
[1045.80 → 1046.34] verse 3,
[1046.72 → 1047.56] when you ask,
[1047.70 → 1048.60] you don't receive
[1048.60 → 1049.68] because you ask
[1049.68 → 1050.52] with wrong motives
[1050.52 → 1051.70] that you may spend
[1051.70 → 1052.34] what you get
[1052.34 → 1053.18] on your pleasures.
[1054.34 → 1055.38] We're used to that,
[1055.44 → 1055.72] aren't we?
[1056.76 → 1057.86] We certainly live
[1057.86 → 1058.90] in that kind of culture
[1058.90 → 1060.50] where we're used
[1060.50 → 1061.74] to just being able
[1061.74 → 1062.64] to go out
[1062.64 → 1063.88] and do our thing
[1063.88 → 1065.46] because we feel like it.
[1067.26 → 1068.36] And that's what makes
[1068.36 → 1069.24] living in this COVID
[1069.24 → 1070.52] pandemic so hard
[1070.52 → 1073.30] is we have to get used
[1073.30 → 1074.14] to living a different
[1074.14 → 1075.02] kind of life
[1075.02 → 1076.92] and then
[1076.92 → 1079.06] and then our connection
[1079.06 → 1079.80] to God
[1079.80 → 1081.00] rooted
[1081.00 → 1082.82] in learning
[1082.82 → 1083.88] to be connected
[1083.88 → 1085.12] in the context
[1085.12 → 1085.90] of prayer
[1085.90 → 1087.72] is crucial.
[1088.90 → 1091.48] prayer draws us
[1091.48 → 1092.32] into the presence
[1092.32 → 1093.12] of God
[1093.12 → 1095.50] and that's not
[1095.50 → 1096.66] to be taken for granted.
[1097.58 → 1098.42] Oh, sure, I pray.
[1099.16 → 1100.34] Oh, yeah, we said a prayer.
[1101.26 → 1102.20] It's not to be taken
[1102.20 → 1102.84] for granted.
[1103.60 → 1104.88] It's amazing
[1104.88 → 1106.78] that in prayer
[1106.78 → 1107.90] we are connected
[1107.90 → 1109.20] to the God
[1109.20 → 1110.24] of the universe,
[1110.48 → 1111.98] the God who made you,
[1112.10 → 1113.00] the God who made
[1113.00 → 1114.74] everything that there is
[1114.74 → 1116.18] and when you utter
[1116.18 → 1117.26] words to Him,
[1117.26 → 1119.44] that God
[1119.44 → 1120.84] listens.
[1123.68 → 1125.52] He listens so intimately
[1125.52 → 1126.48] that you can be
[1126.48 → 1127.72] absolutely honest
[1127.72 → 1128.32] with God
[1128.32 → 1129.40] and so James says
[1129.40 → 1130.18] when you pray
[1130.18 → 1133.30] then confess your sins
[1133.30 → 1134.08] and then I wish
[1134.08 → 1134.74] he had added
[1134.74 → 1135.90] and confess them
[1135.90 → 1137.10] quietly before God
[1137.10 → 1137.72] but he says
[1137.72 → 1138.92] confess them
[1138.92 → 1140.04] before one another.
[1140.04 → 1143.42] When we gather
[1143.42 → 1143.94] for worship
[1143.94 → 1145.08] we have a time
[1145.08 → 1145.84] of confession
[1145.84 → 1147.66] and we kind of
[1147.66 → 1148.50] sit through that
[1148.50 → 1149.18] and we kind of
[1149.18 → 1150.36] make it a general thing
[1150.36 → 1151.18] and hope that
[1151.18 → 1152.48] that covers us all
[1152.48 → 1153.70] but actually
[1153.70 → 1155.12] James would say
[1155.12 → 1156.76] that's not far enough.
[1158.18 → 1158.78] You've got to
[1158.78 → 1159.98] confess to each other.
[1160.54 → 1160.80] Why?
[1162.42 → 1163.74] Because when prayer
[1163.74 → 1164.52] connects you
[1164.52 → 1165.36] with God
[1165.36 → 1166.46] you don't have to
[1166.46 → 1167.32] worry about your
[1167.32 → 1167.84] weaknesses
[1167.84 → 1169.18] and your failures.
[1170.68 → 1170.92] Sure,
[1171.06 → 1171.80] other people might
[1171.80 → 1172.26] judge you
[1172.26 → 1173.16] but God
[1173.16 → 1174.32] isn't going to
[1174.32 → 1175.48] hold that against you.
[1175.66 → 1176.12] God
[1176.12 → 1177.00] is a God
[1177.00 → 1177.66] of forgiveness.
[1179.56 → 1180.60] We're connected
[1180.60 → 1181.74] to that God
[1181.74 → 1182.60] that God
[1182.60 → 1183.20] of grace
[1183.20 → 1183.94] and mercy
[1183.94 → 1185.32] when we learn
[1185.32 → 1185.88] to live
[1185.88 → 1186.68] in the context
[1186.68 → 1187.92] of prayer.
[1189.28 → 1190.14] So those are
[1190.14 → 1190.98] the two pillars
[1190.98 → 1192.10] that form
[1192.10 → 1192.62] a connection
[1192.62 → 1193.30] to God.
[1194.08 → 1194.80] On the one hand
[1194.80 → 1195.76] learning to live
[1195.76 → 1196.22] in the light
[1196.22 → 1196.74] of eternity
[1196.74 → 1197.76] and on the other
[1197.76 → 1198.22] hand
[1198.22 → 1199.50] learning to live
[1199.50 → 1200.34] in the context
[1200.34 → 1201.26] of prayer.
[1202.10 → 1202.84] Now when I had
[1202.84 → 1203.56] preached this
[1203.56 → 1204.90] at New Life
[1204.90 → 1205.86] and we do
[1205.86 → 1207.18] pre-recorded services
[1207.18 → 1209.44] which gives me
[1209.44 → 1210.08] the freedom to
[1210.08 → 1210.62] preach wherever
[1210.62 → 1211.48] I feel like it
[1211.48 → 1211.84] I thought
[1211.84 → 1212.28] you know what
[1212.28 → 1212.90] I should preach
[1212.90 → 1213.76] in front of a bridge.
[1214.22 → 1214.66] So we went
[1214.66 → 1215.18] in front of the
[1215.18 → 1215.94] mission bridge
[1215.94 → 1216.60] there on
[1216.60 → 1217.36] Highway 11
[1217.36 → 1219.82] with the
[1219.82 → 1220.56] Fraser River
[1220.56 → 1221.70] in the background.
[1222.00 → 1222.64] It was a beautiful
[1222.64 → 1223.70] scenic setting.
[1223.88 → 1224.62] It was a great
[1224.62 → 1225.48] place to preach.
[1225.48 → 1227.72] And when we
[1227.72 → 1228.42] saw it on the
[1228.42 → 1229.14] recording then
[1229.14 → 1229.62] of course
[1229.62 → 1231.12] because it was
[1231.12 → 1231.78] a sunny day
[1231.78 → 1232.66] the river
[1232.66 → 1233.10] just
[1233.10 → 1235.24] overexposed
[1235.24 → 1235.76] everything.
[1236.00 → 1236.60] So all you
[1236.60 → 1236.94] could see
[1236.94 → 1237.44] was me
[1237.44 → 1237.72] and you
[1237.72 → 1238.08] couldn't even
[1238.08 → 1238.88] see the bridge.
[1239.44 → 1240.24] So I had to
[1240.24 → 1240.78] think of something
[1240.78 → 1241.82] else to illustrate
[1241.82 → 1243.00] this point
[1243.00 → 1243.74] of saying
[1243.74 → 1244.16] look
[1244.16 → 1244.88] if you want
[1244.88 → 1245.54] to be deeply
[1245.54 → 1246.58] connected to God
[1246.58 → 1247.68] for an all-in
[1247.68 → 1248.26] faith
[1248.26 → 1249.56] you need to be
[1249.56 → 1250.46] rooted in both
[1250.46 → 1251.88] banks
[1251.88 → 1252.08] banks
[1252.08 → 1253.32] in order to
[1253.32 → 1253.82] form that
[1253.82 → 1254.52] bridge of
[1254.52 → 1255.36] connection to
[1255.36 → 1255.82] God.
[1257.22 → 1257.54] And so I
[1257.54 → 1258.24] came across
[1258.24 → 1260.88] a living
[1260.88 → 1261.52] bridge
[1261.52 → 1262.74] which in fact
[1262.74 → 1264.12] is a way
[1264.12 → 1264.54] better
[1264.54 → 1265.98] illustration
[1265.98 → 1267.30] of what
[1267.30 → 1267.90] James is
[1267.90 → 1268.58] trying to
[1268.58 → 1269.42] teach us
[1269.42 → 1270.18] here in
[1270.18 → 1271.40] James chapter 5.
[1272.84 → 1273.54] Living bridges
[1273.54 → 1274.84] occur in
[1274.84 → 1275.54] northwest
[1275.54 → 1276.26] India
[1276.26 → 1276.78] in a place
[1276.78 → 1277.78] called Meghalaya.
[1277.78 → 1278.88] It's a place
[1278.88 → 1279.46] that gets
[1279.46 → 1279.94] the most
[1279.94 → 1280.60] rain of
[1280.60 → 1281.28] any place
[1281.28 → 1281.68] on the
[1281.68 → 1282.06] planet.
[1282.26 → 1282.90] Something like
[1282.90 → 1284.12] they average
[1284.12 → 1285.28] 4 meters
[1285.28 → 1286.36] of rain
[1286.36 → 1287.86] on average
[1287.86 → 1288.90] per year.
[1289.82 → 1290.22] I think we
[1290.22 → 1290.60] probably
[1290.60 → 1291.30] at least in
[1291.30 → 1291.68] Abbotsford
[1291.68 → 1292.28] we get about
[1292.28 → 1293.28] a meter
[1293.28 → 1293.84] maybe a
[1293.84 → 1294.32] meter and a
[1294.32 → 1294.68] half
[1294.68 → 1296.26] year
[1296.26 → 1297.22] average
[1297.22 → 1297.86] accumulation.
[1299.10 → 1299.26] So
[1299.26 → 1300.56] these people
[1300.56 → 1301.16] have to put up
[1301.16 → 1301.84] with enormous
[1301.84 → 1303.14] monsoon rains
[1303.14 → 1304.28] and tremendous
[1304.28 → 1305.04] flooding so you
[1305.04 → 1305.88] can well imagine
[1305.88 → 1307.18] years ago
[1307.18 → 1308.06] when they
[1308.06 → 1308.58] tried to
[1308.58 → 1309.04] build a
[1309.04 → 1309.72] bridge across
[1309.72 → 1310.38] a stream
[1310.38 → 1312.14] the banks
[1312.14 → 1312.68] would so
[1312.68 → 1313.44] easily just
[1313.44 → 1314.28] wash out
[1314.28 → 1314.86] and then the
[1314.86 → 1315.40] bridges would
[1315.40 → 1315.96] collapse.
[1317.24 → 1317.68] I got to
[1317.68 → 1318.16] thinking you
[1318.16 → 1318.46] know what
[1318.46 → 1320.44] that's a lot
[1320.44 → 1320.96] of times
[1320.96 → 1322.12] the way we
[1322.12 → 1322.82] try to build
[1322.82 → 1323.46] our connection
[1323.46 → 1324.10] to God
[1324.10 → 1325.20] and then
[1325.20 → 1327.06] the monsoons
[1327.06 → 1327.80] of hardship
[1327.80 → 1328.56] or trial
[1328.56 → 1329.34] in our lives
[1329.34 → 1330.00] come along
[1330.00 → 1330.52] and wash
[1330.52 → 1331.26] out the banks
[1331.26 → 1331.92] and our bridge
[1331.92 → 1332.44] collapses
[1332.44 → 1333.24] and we give
[1333.24 → 1333.76] up on our
[1333.76 → 1334.10] connection
[1334.10 → 1334.70] with God.
[1335.66 → 1336.26] So you know
[1336.26 → 1336.68] what the people
[1336.68 → 1337.38] of Meghalaya
[1337.38 → 1337.96] did in
[1337.96 → 1338.30] northwest
[1338.30 → 1338.82] India.
[1339.40 → 1340.02] They discovered
[1340.02 → 1340.86] that they
[1340.86 → 1341.34] could take
[1341.34 → 1342.04] a tree that
[1342.04 → 1342.84] grew naturally
[1342.84 → 1343.82] there and
[1343.82 → 1344.78] train the roots
[1344.78 → 1345.54] of the tree
[1345.54 → 1346.62] to come up
[1346.62 → 1347.10] out of the
[1347.10 → 1347.96] ground on one
[1347.96 → 1348.50] side of the
[1348.50 → 1349.04] bank of a
[1349.04 → 1349.42] stream.
[1349.84 → 1350.14] They could
[1350.14 → 1350.78] train the
[1350.78 → 1351.38] roots of
[1351.38 → 1352.02] that tree
[1352.02 → 1353.16] to go over
[1353.16 → 1353.82] the stream
[1353.82 → 1354.80] and then they
[1354.80 → 1355.30] would plant
[1355.30 → 1356.14] it back into
[1356.14 → 1356.60] the other
[1356.60 → 1357.68] bank and
[1357.68 → 1357.96] they would
[1357.96 → 1358.52] do that with
[1358.52 → 1359.12] a tree on
[1359.12 → 1359.46] the other
[1359.46 → 1359.94] side of the
[1359.94 → 1360.58] bank back
[1360.58 → 1361.22] to the
[1361.22 → 1362.34] first bank
[1362.34 → 1363.42] and eventually
[1363.42 → 1364.68] a web of
[1364.68 → 1365.74] roots would
[1365.74 → 1366.84] grow together
[1366.84 → 1367.44] so that they
[1367.44 → 1368.10] could fill it
[1368.10 → 1368.84] with rocks
[1368.84 → 1369.54] and mud
[1369.54 → 1370.48] and create
[1370.48 → 1371.24] a path.
[1371.98 → 1372.70] I brought a
[1372.70 → 1373.36] picture along
[1373.36 → 1373.74] I don't know
[1373.74 → 1374.24] if their it
[1374.24 → 1375.14] is so there
[1375.14 → 1375.62] it is.
[1376.68 → 1377.52] And so it
[1377.52 → 1378.16] doesn't matter
[1378.16 → 1379.24] really how much
[1379.24 → 1380.10] rain comes
[1380.10 → 1381.20] down but
[1381.20 → 1381.90] those roots
[1381.90 → 1382.60] are firmly
[1382.60 → 1383.94] established deep
[1383.94 → 1384.88] into the banks
[1384.88 → 1385.44] and to the
[1385.44 → 1386.26] sides of the
[1386.26 → 1387.46] stream so that
[1387.46 → 1387.84] they could
[1387.84 → 1388.76] create a
[1388.76 → 1389.68] connection from
[1389.68 → 1391.02] one side to
[1391.02 → 1391.46] the other.
[1391.46 → 1392.86] And that's
[1392.86 → 1393.40] something of
[1393.40 → 1394.10] what the
[1394.10 → 1394.94] connection of
[1394.94 → 1395.62] God as
[1395.62 → 1396.62] James describes
[1396.62 → 1398.10] it is like.
[1398.74 → 1399.40] It's not a
[1399.40 → 1400.12] matter of just
[1400.12 → 1400.76] saying oh
[1400.76 → 1402.58] okay, so I
[1402.58 → 1403.16] prayed I
[1403.16 → 1403.44] should be
[1403.44 → 1403.90] connected to
[1403.90 → 1404.14] God.
[1404.58 → 1405.48] Oh yeah I
[1405.48 → 1405.94] thought about
[1405.94 → 1406.62] eternity I
[1406.62 → 1406.90] should be
[1406.90 → 1407.38] connected to
[1407.38 → 1407.70] God.
[1408.28 → 1408.56] No it
[1408.56 → 1409.04] takes a
[1409.04 → 1410.62] lifetime of
[1410.62 → 1412.20] learning to
[1412.20 → 1413.02] live in the
[1413.02 → 1413.36] light of
[1413.36 → 1413.78] eternity.
[1414.02 → 1414.50] It takes a
[1414.50 → 1415.34] lifetime of
[1415.34 → 1416.02] learning to
[1416.02 → 1416.56] live in the
[1416.56 → 1417.34] context of
[1417.34 → 1417.70] prayer.
[1418.32 → 1418.76] Perhaps you're
[1418.76 → 1419.12] not going to
[1419.12 → 1419.60] get it right
[1419.60 → 1420.34] the first time.
[1420.46 → 1421.12] Perhaps you're
[1421.12 → 1421.72] going to have
[1421.72 → 1422.24] stumbling.
[1422.44 → 1423.00] Perhaps you're
[1423.00 → 1423.44] going to have
[1423.44 → 1424.70] those times of
[1424.70 → 1425.66] wash out.
[1426.62 → 1427.28] But those
[1427.28 → 1429.34] roots of
[1429.34 → 1429.94] learning to
[1429.94 → 1430.50] live in the
[1430.50 → 1430.84] light of
[1430.84 → 1431.70] eternity and
[1431.70 → 1432.24] learning to
[1432.24 → 1433.68] live in the
[1433.68 → 1434.46] context of
[1434.46 → 1435.62] prayer are
[1435.62 → 1436.30] going to be
[1436.30 → 1437.56] firmly established
[1437.56 → 1438.88] and eventually
[1438.88 → 1440.06] they will grow
[1440.06 → 1441.20] into a web
[1441.20 → 1442.66] that creates a
[1442.66 → 1444.18] direct path to
[1444.18 → 1444.58] God.
[1445.58 → 1446.58] So that you
[1446.58 → 1447.42] can live in
[1447.42 → 1448.00] the assurance
[1448.00 → 1449.86] that God is
[1449.86 → 1450.48] always with
[1450.48 → 1450.74] you.
[1451.12 → 1451.72] And you
[1451.72 → 1452.66] are always
[1452.66 → 1453.64] walking with
[1453.64 → 1453.94] God.
[1454.38 → 1454.86] Let's pray
[1454.86 → 1455.18] together.
[1457.74 → 1458.46] Father in
[1458.46 → 1458.68] heaven,
[1459.78 → 1460.56] thank you
[1460.56 → 1465.70] that you
[1465.70 → 1466.40] are a
[1466.40 → 1466.92] God that
[1466.92 → 1468.76] hears us.
[1471.80 → 1472.48] You're a
[1472.48 → 1472.88] God that
[1472.88 → 1473.66] pays attention
[1473.66 → 1474.24] when we
[1474.24 → 1474.84] cry out
[1474.84 → 1475.80] loudly to
[1475.80 → 1476.08] you.
[1477.72 → 1478.38] You're a
[1478.38 → 1479.88] God that
[1479.88 → 1481.20] hears us
[1481.20 → 1482.42] and listens
[1482.42 → 1483.68] even when
[1483.68 → 1484.58] we mumble
[1484.58 → 1485.70] and grumble
[1485.70 → 1487.00] out to
[1487.00 → 1487.32] you.
[1489.48 → 1490.46] God, thank
[1490.46 → 1491.02] you that you
[1491.02 → 1491.72] are a God
[1491.72 → 1493.24] that has
[1493.24 → 1493.76] the whole
[1493.76 → 1495.20] universe in
[1495.20 → 1496.22] your hand
[1496.22 → 1497.20] from the
[1497.20 → 1497.82] very beginning
[1497.82 → 1498.72] of time
[1498.72 → 1499.96] to the very
[1499.96 → 1500.82] end of time.
[1500.82 → 1501.82] God, thank you
[1501.82 → 1502.82] for the
[1502.82 → 1503.82] God.
[1503.82 → 1503.96] So we
[1503.96 → 1504.70] pray, God,
[1504.78 → 1506.94] that you
[1506.94 → 1507.46] will teach
[1507.46 → 1508.90] us what it
[1508.90 → 1509.36] means to
[1509.36 → 1509.94] live in the
[1509.94 → 1510.26] light of
[1510.26 → 1510.72] eternity.
[1510.96 → 1511.56] Teach us
[1511.56 → 1511.88] what it
[1511.88 → 1512.52] means to
[1512.52 → 1513.14] be connected
[1513.14 → 1514.08] through prayer.
[1515.36 → 1516.18] And God,
[1516.78 → 1517.74] we confess
[1517.74 → 1519.30] that it's
[1519.30 → 1519.88] easy for us
[1519.88 → 1520.58] to give up.
[1521.80 → 1522.60] It's easy
[1522.60 → 1523.66] for us to
[1523.66 → 1524.44] just fall
[1524.44 → 1525.32] flat on
[1525.32 → 1525.90] our face.
[1525.90 → 1526.02] us.
[1527.22 → 1528.00] And so
[1528.00 → 1528.72] pick us up
[1528.72 → 1529.72] again and
[1529.72 → 1530.08] again.
[1530.94 → 1531.58] Restore us
[1531.58 → 1532.36] to yourself.
[1533.92 → 1534.94] Create in us,
[1535.06 → 1535.50] God, a
[1535.50 → 1536.40] clean heart.
[1538.06 → 1539.24] And draw us
[1539.24 → 1540.10] to yourself
[1540.10 → 1542.58] so that we
[1542.58 → 1545.22] can proclaim
[1545.22 → 1546.30] your goodness,
[1547.26 → 1547.92] so that we
[1547.92 → 1548.50] can let your
[1548.50 → 1549.60] light shine,
[1550.26 → 1550.98] and so that
[1550.98 → 1552.10] we can proclaim
[1552.10 → 1553.28] your kingdom
[1553.28 → 1554.78] and that you
[1554.78 → 1555.60] are the ruler
[1555.60 → 1557.60] still and
[1557.60 → 1558.64] that you
[1558.64 → 1559.40] will accomplish
[1559.40 → 1560.20] your purposes
[1560.20 → 1561.28] in our world
[1561.28 → 1562.26] and that
[1562.26 → 1562.88] nothing,
[1563.06 → 1563.60] absolutely
[1563.60 → 1564.14] nothing,
[1564.32 → 1565.08] no pandemic
[1565.08 → 1566.02] ever hinders
[1566.02 → 1566.82] your purposes.
[1568.32 → 1568.78] And so we
