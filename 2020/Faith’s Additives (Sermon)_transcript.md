[0.00 --> 1.70]  Thank you for that prayer.
[3.24 --> 4.28]  It's true.
[4.86 --> 6.38]  And your reflections, Peter.
[6.38 --> 13.00]  The situation does make us think, doesn't it?
[14.06 --> 17.40]  While we adjust the sound, we've got to adjust ourselves.
[19.92 --> 23.40]  When I think of Christian education, if I have my history correct,
[23.48 --> 27.38]  one of the reasons that we began Christian schools is,
[27.38 --> 30.04]  if you don't mind the word, to isolate.
[31.48 --> 33.86]  Because we saw the dangers that were elsewhere.
[35.30 --> 38.20]  And we didn't isolate because we wanted to just be by ourselves,
[38.30 --> 40.06]  but we wanted to preserve health.
[41.96 --> 43.42]  Healthy views of life.
[44.80 --> 48.06]  That's one thing I've seen there's value in isolation.
[48.34 --> 52.46]  This weekend, I'm rambling before my message.
[52.92 --> 53.52]  Forgive me.
[53.52 --> 59.44]  In Leviticus, it talked about how with certain diseases,
[60.50 --> 65.50]  people were sent outside the camp to preserve those in the camp.
[66.06 --> 69.72]  It's been part of our life for a long time.
[69.86 --> 72.62]  And being wise about our isolation.
[72.62 --> 78.38]  The other thing I've been very conscious of through this time,
[79.26 --> 80.32]  as we confessed,
[81.26 --> 86.84]  is what our world has not taken serious enough
[86.84 --> 90.06]  is the pandemic of sin.
[92.24 --> 93.48]  Because it's deadly.
[95.20 --> 98.32]  In our secular world, we think on this level only.
[98.32 --> 104.16]  So COVID scares the you-know-what out of us.
[104.82 --> 107.36]  Because we don't, as a culture, think this way.
[109.30 --> 111.32]  But we don't want to be that way, do we?
[112.60 --> 119.18]  We want to see that with illness and with spiritual,
[119.74 --> 121.06]  shall we call it, illness,
[121.06 --> 124.04]  we have a God that we can go to.
[125.20 --> 129.22]  And that's really where the message this morning focuses on
[129.22 --> 132.24]  when we talk about faith's additives.
[136.58 --> 138.26]  Oh, it's quite some time ago,
[138.38 --> 139.56]  probably a year and a half,
[140.36 --> 143.32]  that I preached on 2 Peter 1.
[143.32 --> 149.82]  The verses 5 to...
[149.82 --> 152.22]  5 and...
[152.22 --> 153.08]  3 and 4.
[153.42 --> 155.28]  I've got to put my glasses on.
[156.00 --> 158.24]  We preached on the verses 3 and 4.
[159.60 --> 161.80]  And next week, hopefully,
[162.02 --> 165.82]  I can continue on with verses 12 and 13.
[165.82 --> 169.52]  And we might put these three messages
[169.52 --> 173.88]  using the analogy VIM.
[174.20 --> 176.06]  You know, VIM is a...
[176.06 --> 177.68]  Well, I think it's soap of some kind.
[178.10 --> 179.92]  V stands for vision.
[180.90 --> 182.64]  The vision that Christ gives us.
[182.80 --> 183.44]  And we'll...
[183.44 --> 184.88]  That's verses 3 and 4.
[185.00 --> 186.28]  We'll just read that again.
[187.54 --> 189.70]  This morning, we look at the I.
[190.60 --> 193.02]  The intent that we have
[193.02 --> 195.28]  to pursue this vision in Christ.
[195.82 --> 198.86]  And then next week,
[198.96 --> 200.14]  we look at the means.
[200.78 --> 201.98]  And there's many means,
[202.14 --> 204.76]  but primarily the means of Scripture.
[207.48 --> 208.94]  So that being said,
[209.00 --> 210.32]  let me also add this,
[210.62 --> 212.20]  that as I was reviewing
[212.20 --> 216.02]  and revising this message,
[216.38 --> 220.48]  it reminded me of how this is the message for me
[220.48 --> 224.44]  as much as it is for anyone else.
[225.82 --> 229.92]  2 Peter 1, verses 1 to 11.
[229.92 --> 236.74]  Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ,
[236.74 --> 238.68]  to those who,
[238.68 --> 241.56]  to those who, through the righteousness of our God and Savior,
[241.56 --> 243.12]  Jesus Christ,
[243.12 --> 249.42]  have received a faith as precious as ours.
[250.26 --> 253.90]  Grace and peace be yours in abundance
[253.90 --> 259.42]  through the knowledge or through our knowing of God and of Jesus,
[260.22 --> 260.88]  our Lord.
[260.88 --> 269.24]  His divine power has given us everything we need for a godly life
[269.24 --> 273.82]  through our knowledge or knowing of Him who called us
[273.82 --> 277.28]  by His own glory and goodness.
[278.28 --> 282.40]  Through these resources of knowing Him,
[282.64 --> 284.18]  through His goodness and glory,
[284.64 --> 289.46]  He has given us His very great and precious promises
[289.46 --> 295.18]  so that through them you may participate in the divine nature,
[295.18 --> 302.06]  having escaped the corruption in the world caused by evil desires.
[304.06 --> 306.34]  And then comes our text.
[307.06 --> 309.48]  For this very reason,
[310.04 --> 314.52]  make every effort to add to your faith goodness
[314.52 --> 316.74]  and to goodness,
[316.74 --> 316.80]  and to goodness,
[316.80 --> 317.86]  and to goodness,
[317.86 --> 318.10]  knowledge,
[318.10 --> 320.22]  and to knowledge,
[320.22 --> 322.16]  self-control,
[322.16 --> 324.92]  and to self-control,
[324.92 --> 326.44]  perseverance,
[327.44 --> 328.68]  and to perseverance,
[329.96 --> 330.52]  godliness,
[331.42 --> 332.86]  and to godliness,
[333.90 --> 335.62]  mutual affection,
[336.62 --> 338.84]  and to mutual affection,
[340.06 --> 340.54]  love.
[340.54 --> 346.96]  For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure,
[347.60 --> 350.82]  they will keep you from being ineffective
[350.82 --> 356.32]  and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[357.44 --> 361.54]  But whoever does not have them is nearsighted and blind,
[361.90 --> 365.78]  forgetting that they have been cleansed from their past sins.
[367.04 --> 369.06]  Therefore, my brothers and sisters,
[369.06 --> 374.84]  make every effort to confirm your calling and election.
[376.18 --> 377.96]  For if you do these things,
[378.26 --> 380.32]  you will never stumble,
[380.84 --> 383.58]  and you will receive a rich welcome
[383.58 --> 385.52]  into the eternal kingdom
[385.52 --> 387.98]  of our Lord and Savior,
[388.72 --> 390.12]  Jesus Christ.
[391.14 --> 392.86]  It's the word of our Lord.
[393.56 --> 394.94]  Thanks be to God.
[394.94 --> 397.78]  Dear friends,
[397.94 --> 399.18]  brothers and sisters,
[399.18 --> 400.40]  in Christ,
[400.64 --> 402.20]  a number of years ago,
[402.70 --> 405.18]  when we were still living in Winnipeg,
[405.30 --> 408.58]  some generous friends gave me a brand new barbecue
[408.58 --> 409.52]  for my birthday.
[410.96 --> 412.44]  It was fall.
[412.92 --> 415.10]  My birthday's in September,
[415.44 --> 418.12]  and that's a busy time for pastors.
[418.12 --> 421.16]  And so I took the box and put it in the garage.
[422.72 --> 425.16]  And we were several weeks into spring,
[425.86 --> 430.54]  and I had once again begun to use the old barbecue,
[431.22 --> 432.82]  which, like its owner,
[432.94 --> 434.44]  didn't burn evenly, you know,
[434.54 --> 435.62]  hot in some spots,
[435.72 --> 436.96]  not so hot in the other.
[437.54 --> 438.98]  And one Saturday afternoon,
[439.04 --> 442.54]  I came home from finishing preparations,
[442.54 --> 444.30]  and there was the new barbecue,
[445.50 --> 446.48]  fully assembled,
[447.10 --> 448.52]  sitting in our family room
[448.52 --> 452.86]  with our friends standing beside it.
[452.92 --> 455.38]  They'd come and put the whole thing together.
[455.88 --> 457.76]  I had been looking against it a little bit,
[457.82 --> 459.50]  and I was so grateful.
[461.46 --> 462.58]  Now, wouldn't it be good
[462.58 --> 464.66]  if God did that to us spiritually?
[464.66 --> 469.24]  If he just put us all together
[469.24 --> 471.32]  so that there we were,
[471.50 --> 472.66]  ready to go,
[474.62 --> 477.00]  firing on all eight cylinders, you might say.
[477.90 --> 479.72]  If God would, you know,
[480.80 --> 481.96]  surprise us
[481.96 --> 485.06]  and make us fully functional,
[486.56 --> 489.36]  it would be great
[489.36 --> 491.62]  if the Holy Spirit would go
[491.62 --> 493.62]  presto, kind of,
[494.66 --> 496.92]  and we could take on
[496.92 --> 498.58]  what Peter talks about
[498.58 --> 500.02]  as this divine nature,
[500.66 --> 503.70]  then I would never misspeak again
[503.70 --> 504.40]  in my life.
[505.38 --> 507.60]  I would always be patient
[507.60 --> 509.38]  in traffic.
[510.98 --> 513.06]  I'd always be quick to forgive
[513.06 --> 514.36]  whoever hurt me.
[515.94 --> 518.46]  And I'd no longer excuse
[518.46 --> 520.46]  my miserly attitude
[520.46 --> 521.56]  as good stewardship.
[521.56 --> 526.66]  then I'd love people consistently.
[528.14 --> 530.34]  Well, it's somewhat wishful thinking
[530.34 --> 532.26]  because God says,
[532.76 --> 534.84]  as he does in those first few verses
[534.84 --> 535.66]  of Peter,
[535.98 --> 536.96]  I've given you
[536.96 --> 539.32]  everything we need
[539.32 --> 542.26]  for a godly life,
[542.52 --> 545.68]  but read the label on the box,
[545.68 --> 548.54]  assembly required.
[550.86 --> 552.40]  See, it's not enough
[552.40 --> 553.98]  to just believe
[553.98 --> 555.44]  in Jesus.
[557.18 --> 558.62]  We need to have
[558.62 --> 560.52]  more than faith.
[561.72 --> 563.54]  We need to build on it.
[564.60 --> 566.60]  Or at least we need to
[566.60 --> 567.64]  want
[567.64 --> 569.22]  to build,
[569.44 --> 570.98]  to add to it.
[570.98 --> 573.98]  For this very reason,
[574.18 --> 574.80]  says Peter,
[574.92 --> 576.36]  you make every effort
[576.36 --> 577.80]  to add
[577.80 --> 579.28]  to your faith.
[580.86 --> 581.82]  In other words,
[582.02 --> 583.52]  it falls to reason.
[583.62 --> 584.64]  It only makes
[584.64 --> 586.26]  good sense
[586.26 --> 587.24]  that once
[587.24 --> 588.76]  we grasp
[588.76 --> 591.22]  who Jesus is,
[591.58 --> 592.56]  what he's done
[592.56 --> 593.30]  for us,
[593.42 --> 595.02]  and what he's holding out
[595.02 --> 596.66]  for us in our future,
[596.66 --> 597.98]  that we're going
[597.98 --> 599.70]  to want to add
[599.70 --> 601.30]  to our faith in him.
[605.34 --> 606.22]  If we
[606.22 --> 608.12]  truly believe,
[608.36 --> 609.10]  see Jesus
[609.10 --> 610.28]  for who he is,
[610.36 --> 611.64]  then we'll at least
[611.64 --> 612.98]  want
[612.98 --> 614.82]  to be like him.
[616.62 --> 617.26]  Because
[617.26 --> 618.52]  true faith
[618.52 --> 619.88]  gets
[619.88 --> 620.94]  to work.
[621.74 --> 622.42]  And as Peter
[622.42 --> 623.34]  and as James
[623.34 --> 623.82]  says,
[624.48 --> 625.18]  such faith
[625.18 --> 626.58]  actually does work.
[627.38 --> 627.94]  It gets
[627.94 --> 628.40]  the job
[628.40 --> 628.78]  done.
[631.32 --> 632.34]  And the incentive
[632.34 --> 633.90]  for working
[633.90 --> 634.84]  out our faith
[634.84 --> 635.90]  is this vision
[635.90 --> 638.08]  of who we are
[638.08 --> 638.94]  and of who
[638.94 --> 639.74]  we actually
[639.74 --> 641.26]  will become
[641.26 --> 642.68]  in Christ
[642.68 --> 643.12]  Jesus.
[646.30 --> 647.02]  I think
[647.02 --> 647.46]  it was last
[647.46 --> 648.06]  summer I was
[648.06 --> 648.86]  privileged to do
[648.86 --> 649.52]  some fishing
[649.52 --> 650.32]  on the ocean,
[651.06 --> 652.04]  and we had
[652.04 --> 652.84]  this guide
[652.84 --> 655.20]  who was
[655.20 --> 655.82]  continually,
[655.82 --> 656.70]  and this
[656.70 --> 657.16]  has to do
[657.16 --> 657.74]  with the vision.
[657.98 --> 658.12]  He was
[658.12 --> 658.46]  turned,
[659.10 --> 659.68]  he was,
[660.06 --> 660.62]  you could see
[660.62 --> 661.14]  someone getting
[661.14 --> 661.56]  bored.
[661.56 --> 663.14]  We had to
[663.14 --> 663.84]  imagine
[663.84 --> 664.76]  this fish
[664.76 --> 665.70]  on the line.
[666.34 --> 666.90]  Imagine
[666.90 --> 667.52]  the fish.
[668.34 --> 669.16]  And then we
[669.16 --> 669.84]  lost one,
[670.06 --> 670.48]  and he said,
[670.56 --> 671.08]  now you've got to
[671.08 --> 672.36]  imagine the fish
[672.36 --> 673.00]  in the boat.
[673.88 --> 675.04]  He wanted us
[675.04 --> 676.12]  to stay engaged.
[676.12 --> 676.36]  fished.
[677.80 --> 678.78]  Our faith
[678.78 --> 679.46]  in Jesus
[679.46 --> 680.20]  is the
[680.20 --> 680.90]  incentive
[680.90 --> 681.84]  for us
[681.84 --> 684.14]  to, as it
[684.14 --> 684.66]  were, keep
[684.66 --> 685.28]  our line
[685.28 --> 685.98]  in the water,
[686.40 --> 687.20]  to keep
[687.20 --> 687.66]  fishing,
[688.04 --> 688.78]  to keep
[688.78 --> 689.36]  working
[689.36 --> 690.36]  at it,
[690.76 --> 691.64]  or at least
[691.64 --> 692.34]  to fully
[692.34 --> 693.14]  intend
[693.14 --> 694.64]  to obey
[694.64 --> 695.20]  God,
[695.40 --> 696.04]  to follow
[696.04 --> 696.70]  Christ.
[697.34 --> 697.84]  Keep
[697.84 --> 698.24]  fishing,
[698.40 --> 698.86]  if you will.
[698.86 --> 702.54]  an illusion,
[703.10 --> 703.50]  Dallas
[703.50 --> 704.00]  Willard
[704.00 --> 704.40]  says,
[704.50 --> 704.92]  that has
[704.92 --> 705.68]  stifled
[705.68 --> 706.56]  spiritual
[706.56 --> 707.68]  formation
[707.68 --> 709.20]  in Christians
[709.20 --> 709.82]  is the
[709.82 --> 710.26]  thinking
[710.26 --> 711.54]  that we
[711.54 --> 712.28]  can believe
[712.28 --> 712.92]  in Jesus
[712.92 --> 714.82]  and be
[714.82 --> 715.46]  slack when
[715.46 --> 715.94]  it comes
[715.94 --> 716.66]  to obeying
[716.66 --> 717.60]  or following
[717.60 --> 717.96]  him.
[718.68 --> 719.12]  We've
[719.12 --> 719.46]  emphasized
[719.46 --> 720.12]  faith.
[720.12 --> 723.44]  Jesus
[723.44 --> 724.02]  said to
[724.02 --> 724.24]  his
[724.24 --> 724.80]  disciples,
[725.00 --> 725.24]  you know,
[725.32 --> 725.54]  if you
[725.54 --> 725.96]  love me,
[726.02 --> 726.38]  you keep
[726.38 --> 726.64]  my
[726.64 --> 727.14]  commandments.
[728.00 --> 728.38]  They go
[728.38 --> 728.86]  together.
[731.78 --> 732.26]  Gandhi
[732.26 --> 732.90]  said that
[732.90 --> 733.54]  if Christians
[733.54 --> 734.04]  would live
[734.04 --> 734.72]  according to
[734.72 --> 735.48]  their belief,
[736.06 --> 737.12]  we would
[737.12 --> 737.86]  all become
[737.86 --> 738.46]  Christians.
[740.42 --> 741.38]  And the
[741.38 --> 741.98]  truth is,
[742.14 --> 742.60]  Christians
[742.60 --> 744.20]  do act
[744.20 --> 744.90]  according
[744.90 --> 746.02]  to their
[746.02 --> 746.58]  belief.
[747.34 --> 748.50]  And many
[748.50 --> 749.74]  reveal by
[749.74 --> 749.98]  their
[749.98 --> 750.56]  actions
[750.56 --> 751.00]  that they
[751.00 --> 751.40]  don't
[751.40 --> 751.88]  believe
[751.88 --> 752.52]  in Jesus
[752.52 --> 753.76]  all that
[753.76 --> 754.66]  much.
[755.94 --> 756.70]  Because
[756.70 --> 757.08]  it's
[757.08 --> 757.48]  simply
[757.48 --> 757.88]  not
[757.88 --> 758.58]  possible,
[758.74 --> 759.28]  as Jesus
[759.28 --> 759.74]  said,
[760.14 --> 760.84]  to believe
[760.84 --> 761.40]  in him
[761.40 --> 762.66]  and love
[762.66 --> 763.68]  him and
[763.68 --> 764.78]  not obey
[764.78 --> 765.16]  him,
[765.46 --> 765.82]  or at
[765.82 --> 766.08]  least
[766.08 --> 766.76]  intend
[766.76 --> 767.08]  to.
[768.38 --> 769.08]  That's
[769.08 --> 769.50]  Peter's
[769.50 --> 769.86]  flow of
[769.86 --> 770.36]  thought when
[770.36 --> 770.84]  he says,
[771.38 --> 771.86]  for this
[771.86 --> 772.50]  reason,
[773.58 --> 774.32]  make every
[774.32 --> 775.80]  effort to
[775.80 --> 777.10]  add to
[777.10 --> 777.82]  your faith.
[779.74 --> 780.50]  because of
[780.50 --> 781.48]  how you
[781.48 --> 781.80]  know
[781.80 --> 782.48]  Christ.
[783.38 --> 783.86]  Build on
[783.86 --> 784.06]  that
[784.06 --> 784.62]  knowledge.
[786.22 --> 786.86]  See,
[786.94 --> 787.16]  that's
[787.16 --> 787.90]  faith that's
[787.90 --> 788.56]  followed up.
[788.66 --> 788.98]  It's
[788.98 --> 789.44]  being
[789.44 --> 790.42]  faithful.
[792.02 --> 792.58]  And it
[792.58 --> 793.50]  involves a
[793.50 --> 795.28]  conscious and
[795.28 --> 796.20]  a persistent
[796.20 --> 797.98]  choice to
[797.98 --> 799.54]  cooperate with
[799.54 --> 801.00]  the spirit of
[801.00 --> 802.80]  Christ so
[802.80 --> 803.28]  that the
[803.28 --> 803.94]  fruits of
[803.94 --> 804.92]  him, you
[804.92 --> 805.14]  know,
[805.50 --> 805.98]  patience,
[806.30 --> 806.70]  joy,
[807.10 --> 807.34]  love,
[807.42 --> 807.74]  and so
[807.74 --> 808.00]  on,
[808.20 --> 808.64]  become
[808.64 --> 809.30]  evident in
[809.30 --> 809.80]  our life.
[811.92 --> 812.74]  Anyone who
[812.74 --> 813.36]  believes in
[813.36 --> 814.92]  Jesus signs
[814.92 --> 815.64]  up, as
[815.64 --> 816.02]  Dallas
[816.02 --> 816.74]  Willard says,
[816.80 --> 817.36]  to be an
[817.36 --> 817.90]  apprentice,
[818.94 --> 819.74]  someone who's
[819.74 --> 821.00]  eager to
[821.00 --> 821.56]  know what
[821.56 --> 822.22]  he teaches,
[823.38 --> 824.94]  to learn the
[824.94 --> 825.68]  tricks of the
[825.68 --> 826.42]  trade of
[826.42 --> 826.90]  being a
[826.90 --> 827.42]  disciple.
[829.56 --> 830.10]  And one of
[830.10 --> 830.60]  his great
[830.60 --> 831.52]  frustrations
[831.52 --> 832.12]  was that
[832.12 --> 833.80]  Christians often
[833.80 --> 835.34]  didn't display
[835.34 --> 837.18]  much desire
[837.18 --> 838.94]  to be more
[838.94 --> 840.40]  like Christ.
[843.36 --> 844.40]  Now, in all
[844.40 --> 844.90]  fairness,
[846.00 --> 847.46]  it's possible
[847.46 --> 848.38]  to make too
[848.38 --> 849.06]  much of
[849.06 --> 850.20]  intending
[850.20 --> 852.16]  to follow
[852.16 --> 852.66]  Christ.
[852.84 --> 853.20]  You know
[853.20 --> 853.84]  the saying,
[854.58 --> 855.10]  the way to
[855.10 --> 855.76]  hell is
[855.76 --> 857.24]  paved with
[857.24 --> 858.18]  good intentions.
[860.34 --> 861.24]  But does
[861.24 --> 862.02]  that rule out
[862.02 --> 862.78]  good intentions?
[864.20 --> 865.16]  If we have
[865.16 --> 865.98]  no intentions,
[866.98 --> 867.68]  we'll do
[867.68 --> 868.06]  nothing.
[870.16 --> 871.16]  It isn't a
[871.16 --> 871.60]  matter of
[871.60 --> 871.98]  whether we
[871.98 --> 872.88]  should have
[872.88 --> 873.54]  intentions,
[873.74 --> 874.36]  I believe it,
[874.40 --> 875.36]  but how
[875.36 --> 876.18]  intent we
[876.18 --> 877.58]  actually are,
[877.72 --> 878.44]  because unless
[878.44 --> 879.16]  we're fully
[879.16 --> 880.82]  intent and
[880.82 --> 881.68]  make every
[881.68 --> 882.22]  effort,
[882.74 --> 883.26]  we'll get
[883.26 --> 883.94]  distracted.
[885.04 --> 885.78]  Believe me,
[886.34 --> 887.48]  I know.
[887.48 --> 891.24]  we have to
[891.24 --> 891.70]  do more
[891.70 --> 892.84]  than like
[892.84 --> 893.88]  to follow
[893.88 --> 894.32]  Jesus.
[895.44 --> 896.44]  We must
[896.44 --> 897.42]  decide
[897.42 --> 898.92]  to obey
[898.92 --> 899.22]  Him,
[899.82 --> 900.62]  to be like
[900.62 --> 900.84]  Him.
[902.12 --> 902.62]  It's the
[902.62 --> 902.98]  difference
[902.98 --> 903.84]  between someone
[903.84 --> 904.78]  who would
[904.78 --> 905.68]  like to
[905.68 --> 906.58]  quit swearing
[906.58 --> 907.10]  or who
[907.10 --> 907.88]  would like
[907.88 --> 908.52]  to quit
[908.52 --> 909.06]  smoking,
[909.34 --> 909.90]  or who
[909.90 --> 910.80]  decides
[910.80 --> 911.56]  to do
[911.56 --> 911.84]  that.
[913.12 --> 914.00]  The one
[914.00 --> 914.24]  will
[914.24 --> 914.90]  persevere.
[914.90 --> 917.80]  the one
[917.80 --> 918.18]  will give
[918.18 --> 918.56]  it some
[918.56 --> 918.94]  effort.
[921.42 --> 922.12]  The one
[922.12 --> 922.48]  will give
[922.48 --> 923.16]  religion a
[923.16 --> 923.60]  shot,
[924.44 --> 925.16]  while the
[925.16 --> 925.86]  other sells
[925.86 --> 926.28]  out,
[927.14 --> 927.70]  makes a
[927.70 --> 927.90]  firm
[927.90 --> 928.46]  decision.
[929.98 --> 930.68]  So the
[930.68 --> 931.10]  proverb,
[931.36 --> 931.68]  that the
[931.68 --> 932.10]  way to
[932.10 --> 932.54]  hell is
[932.54 --> 933.06]  paved with
[933.06 --> 934.12]  good intentions,
[934.80 --> 935.44]  needs to
[935.44 --> 936.90]  be counterbalanced
[936.90 --> 937.62]  with this
[937.62 --> 938.30]  proverb,
[938.92 --> 939.46]  where there
[939.46 --> 939.90]  is a
[939.90 --> 940.30]  will,
[941.04 --> 941.58]  there is
[941.58 --> 941.98]  a way.
[941.98 --> 945.92]  It's
[945.92 --> 946.50]  pretty much
[946.50 --> 947.10]  true of us
[947.10 --> 947.38]  humans,
[947.50 --> 947.94]  isn't it?
[949.12 --> 949.56]  You think
[949.56 --> 949.82]  of your
[949.82 --> 950.50]  own life,
[951.24 --> 951.52]  you've
[951.52 --> 951.78]  probably
[951.78 --> 952.24]  observed
[952.24 --> 952.62]  that,
[952.78 --> 953.32]  we do
[953.32 --> 953.64]  in our
[953.64 --> 953.96]  children
[953.96 --> 954.40]  and in
[954.40 --> 954.94]  ourselves.
[956.02 --> 956.50]  We
[956.50 --> 957.08]  accomplish
[957.08 --> 957.96]  what we
[957.96 --> 958.48]  set out
[958.48 --> 959.06]  to do.
[960.42 --> 960.86]  It's
[960.86 --> 961.30]  what God
[961.30 --> 961.82]  noticed
[961.82 --> 962.30]  at the
[962.30 --> 962.80]  Tower of
[962.80 --> 963.14]  Babel
[963.14 --> 963.86]  when He
[963.86 --> 964.48]  looked down,
[965.28 --> 965.78]  saw the
[965.78 --> 966.48]  activity of
[966.48 --> 966.98]  humans.
[968.72 --> 969.10]  Nothing
[969.10 --> 969.96]  they plan
[969.96 --> 970.60]  to do
[970.60 --> 971.18]  will be
[971.18 --> 971.78]  impossible.
[971.98 --> 972.60]  for them,
[973.16 --> 973.64]  he said.
[976.34 --> 976.98]  The
[976.98 --> 977.34]  will is
[977.34 --> 977.58]  very
[977.58 --> 978.16]  powerful
[978.16 --> 980.94]  and it's
[980.94 --> 981.36]  critical
[981.36 --> 982.40]  for the
[982.40 --> 983.06]  formation
[983.06 --> 984.10]  of our
[984.10 --> 984.60]  spirit
[984.60 --> 985.54]  and our
[985.54 --> 986.18]  character.
[989.12 --> 989.80]  We
[989.80 --> 990.22]  are to
[990.22 --> 991.02]  set our
[991.02 --> 991.46]  will
[991.46 --> 992.52]  on doing
[992.52 --> 993.76]  God's
[993.76 --> 994.28]  will.
[994.46 --> 994.70]  That,
[995.14 --> 995.58]  was it
[995.58 --> 995.88]  not,
[995.98 --> 996.42]  was the
[996.42 --> 996.96]  passion
[996.96 --> 997.88]  of our
[997.88 --> 998.18]  Lord
[998.18 --> 998.66]  Jesus.
[999.34 --> 999.54]  The
[999.54 --> 999.90]  scripture
[999.90 --> 1000.46]  said,
[1000.46 --> 1001.10]  He
[1001.10 --> 1001.88]  set His
[1001.88 --> 1002.36]  heart
[1002.36 --> 1004.08]  resolutely
[1004.08 --> 1005.96]  to go to
[1005.96 --> 1006.52]  Jerusalem
[1006.52 --> 1007.86]  and to
[1007.86 --> 1008.28]  go to
[1008.28 --> 1008.62]  that
[1008.62 --> 1009.74]  cross,
[1010.38 --> 1010.96]  to do
[1010.96 --> 1011.38]  the will
[1011.38 --> 1011.82]  of Him
[1011.82 --> 1012.88]  who sent
[1012.88 --> 1013.18]  Him.
[1013.58 --> 1014.24]  And if it
[1014.24 --> 1014.96]  had not
[1014.96 --> 1015.84]  been Jesus'
[1016.50 --> 1017.58]  resolute
[1017.58 --> 1018.34]  will,
[1018.82 --> 1021.36]  we can be
[1021.36 --> 1022.28]  sure He
[1022.28 --> 1022.68]  would have
[1022.68 --> 1023.54]  given in
[1023.54 --> 1024.40]  to the
[1024.40 --> 1024.92]  political
[1024.92 --> 1025.88]  pressures
[1025.88 --> 1027.04]  around Him.
[1027.04 --> 1027.84]  and our
[1027.84 --> 1028.42]  redemption
[1028.42 --> 1029.76]  would not
[1029.76 --> 1030.50]  have been
[1030.50 --> 1031.12]  accomplished.
[1032.52 --> 1033.24]  And our
[1033.24 --> 1034.02]  own personal
[1034.02 --> 1034.68]  redemption
[1034.68 --> 1035.80]  will not be
[1035.80 --> 1036.30]  fully
[1036.30 --> 1037.20]  accomplished
[1037.20 --> 1038.30]  if we
[1038.30 --> 1038.92]  are not
[1038.92 --> 1039.80]  intent,
[1041.26 --> 1041.92]  willfully
[1041.92 --> 1043.30]  desiring to
[1043.30 --> 1044.14]  do the
[1044.14 --> 1044.52]  will of
[1044.52 --> 1044.94]  God
[1044.94 --> 1046.08]  like Jesus
[1046.08 --> 1046.46]  did.
[1048.08 --> 1049.00]  Peter knows
[1049.00 --> 1049.56]  this is not
[1049.56 --> 1049.96]  an easy
[1049.96 --> 1050.32]  thing.
[1051.46 --> 1052.16]  It takes
[1052.16 --> 1052.92]  a lot,
[1053.12 --> 1054.28]  all of our
[1054.28 --> 1054.72]  effort.
[1054.72 --> 1056.46]  you know
[1056.46 --> 1056.90]  how He
[1056.90 --> 1057.20]  fully
[1057.20 --> 1057.76]  intended
[1057.76 --> 1058.28]  to follow
[1058.28 --> 1058.88]  Christ
[1058.88 --> 1060.86]  and how
[1060.86 --> 1061.46]  He denied
[1061.46 --> 1061.70]  Him
[1061.70 --> 1063.06]  three times.
[1064.82 --> 1065.58]  Isn't that
[1065.58 --> 1065.92]  what it's
[1065.92 --> 1066.20]  like?
[1066.76 --> 1067.48]  Sometimes we
[1067.48 --> 1067.96]  get up in
[1067.96 --> 1068.46]  the morning,
[1069.86 --> 1071.00]  every intent
[1071.00 --> 1072.68]  to do
[1072.68 --> 1073.62]  well that
[1073.62 --> 1074.06]  day,
[1074.42 --> 1075.10]  to be
[1075.10 --> 1076.02]  self-controlled,
[1076.22 --> 1076.74]  to handle
[1076.74 --> 1077.34]  ourselves
[1077.34 --> 1078.20]  perhaps in
[1078.20 --> 1079.06]  a work
[1079.06 --> 1079.84]  situation
[1079.84 --> 1080.66]  better,
[1081.36 --> 1081.76]  and then
[1081.76 --> 1082.10]  we're
[1082.10 --> 1082.90]  confronted
[1082.90 --> 1083.46]  with a
[1083.46 --> 1083.82]  rude
[1083.82 --> 1084.66]  co-worker
[1084.66 --> 1085.38]  or we're
[1085.38 --> 1085.84]  dealt a
[1085.84 --> 1086.54]  verbal blow
[1086.54 --> 1087.26]  by someone
[1087.26 --> 1087.78]  and before
[1087.78 --> 1088.22]  you know
[1088.22 --> 1088.36]  it,
[1088.56 --> 1088.80]  we've
[1088.80 --> 1089.32]  sunk to
[1089.32 --> 1089.50]  their
[1089.50 --> 1089.78]  level
[1089.78 --> 1089.96]  of
[1089.96 --> 1090.40]  behavior.
[1093.04 --> 1093.86]  And that's
[1093.86 --> 1094.56]  why Peter
[1094.56 --> 1095.74]  recognizes that
[1095.74 --> 1096.72]  this process
[1096.72 --> 1097.50]  of spiritual
[1097.50 --> 1098.32]  formation
[1098.32 --> 1098.84]  is a
[1098.84 --> 1099.66]  slow one.
[1101.16 --> 1101.64]  It's the
[1101.64 --> 1102.44]  arduous
[1102.44 --> 1103.92]  life of
[1103.92 --> 1104.56]  the Christian
[1104.56 --> 1105.80]  where you
[1105.80 --> 1106.46]  take one
[1106.46 --> 1107.28]  step forward
[1107.28 --> 1107.88]  and then the
[1107.88 --> 1108.42]  next day you
[1108.42 --> 1109.16]  feel like you've
[1109.16 --> 1109.90]  taken, as we
[1109.90 --> 1110.12]  say,
[1110.24 --> 1110.88]  two back.
[1110.88 --> 1110.92]  back.
[1113.44 --> 1114.12]  And sometimes
[1114.12 --> 1114.76]  when we've, so
[1114.76 --> 1115.44]  to speak, taken
[1115.44 --> 1115.98]  those two
[1115.98 --> 1116.92]  steps back, it's
[1116.92 --> 1118.10]  good to put
[1118.10 --> 1119.06]  life back in
[1119.06 --> 1120.08]  perspective again
[1120.08 --> 1120.66]  and ask
[1120.66 --> 1122.06]  ourselves, who
[1122.06 --> 1122.68]  am I?
[1123.06 --> 1123.94]  Why am I
[1123.94 --> 1124.40]  here?
[1124.86 --> 1125.60]  What am I
[1125.60 --> 1126.52]  doing with my
[1126.52 --> 1127.00]  life?
[1127.86 --> 1128.44]  Let's see.
[1128.86 --> 1129.60]  That's right.
[1130.68 --> 1131.58]  I believe in
[1131.58 --> 1131.98]  Jesus.
[1132.82 --> 1133.46]  I know what
[1133.46 --> 1134.14]  he's done for
[1134.14 --> 1134.82]  me and I know
[1134.82 --> 1135.74]  what he's calling
[1135.74 --> 1136.66]  me to become
[1136.66 --> 1137.46]  and what my
[1137.46 --> 1138.18]  future is.
[1138.24 --> 1138.84]  I need to put
[1138.84 --> 1139.66]  my life in
[1139.66 --> 1140.68]  that sense in
[1140.68 --> 1141.32]  perspective.
[1141.52 --> 1142.90]  One day I am
[1142.90 --> 1143.80]  going to share
[1143.80 --> 1144.80]  in his eternal
[1144.80 --> 1145.38]  glory.
[1147.14 --> 1147.96]  So what does
[1147.96 --> 1148.58]  that mean for
[1148.58 --> 1149.00]  today?
[1151.32 --> 1151.80]  Well, it
[1151.80 --> 1152.48]  means then I,
[1153.28 --> 1154.04]  it's worth
[1154.04 --> 1154.84]  taking that
[1154.84 --> 1156.16]  next one
[1156.16 --> 1157.90]  step of
[1157.90 --> 1159.04]  obedience in
[1159.04 --> 1159.64]  the right
[1159.64 --> 1161.04]  direction.
[1161.94 --> 1162.70]  And sometimes
[1162.70 --> 1163.86]  those little
[1163.86 --> 1164.82]  steps take
[1164.82 --> 1166.74]  such big
[1166.74 --> 1167.58]  effort.
[1170.66 --> 1171.68]  But we're
[1171.68 --> 1172.78]  eager to add
[1172.78 --> 1173.26]  to our
[1173.26 --> 1173.70]  faith.
[1175.02 --> 1176.00]  So we make
[1176.00 --> 1176.70]  that decision
[1176.70 --> 1177.48]  and we take
[1177.48 --> 1178.06]  that right
[1178.06 --> 1178.50]  step.
[1180.52 --> 1181.28]  It's
[1181.28 --> 1181.74]  interesting,
[1181.90 --> 1182.20]  the word
[1182.20 --> 1182.98]  add there
[1182.98 --> 1184.56]  in the
[1184.56 --> 1184.98]  original
[1184.98 --> 1185.66]  apparently
[1185.66 --> 1186.60]  means to
[1186.60 --> 1188.20]  provide the
[1188.20 --> 1189.58]  chorus for.
[1190.14 --> 1190.74]  You know,
[1191.26 --> 1191.84]  this is the
[1191.84 --> 1192.32]  backup.
[1193.30 --> 1193.82]  That's what
[1193.82 --> 1194.18]  it was.
[1194.18 --> 1194.82]  The choral
[1194.82 --> 1195.26]  backup.
[1195.50 --> 1196.48]  Apparently the
[1196.48 --> 1197.00]  Greeks who
[1197.00 --> 1197.80]  loved plays
[1197.80 --> 1198.82]  had choral
[1198.82 --> 1199.24]  backup.
[1200.52 --> 1201.56]  And very
[1201.56 --> 1203.68]  rich people
[1203.68 --> 1205.42]  would provide
[1205.42 --> 1206.54]  that choral
[1206.54 --> 1207.30]  backup.
[1207.80 --> 1208.22]  And that was
[1208.22 --> 1208.86]  called the
[1208.86 --> 1209.84]  additives.
[1210.28 --> 1210.92]  And that's the
[1210.92 --> 1211.54]  meaning somewhat
[1211.54 --> 1212.10]  of the word
[1212.10 --> 1212.26]  here.
[1212.30 --> 1212.56]  In other
[1212.56 --> 1212.76]  words,
[1213.14 --> 1213.86]  Christ is the
[1213.86 --> 1214.62]  main singer
[1214.62 --> 1216.08]  and as we
[1216.08 --> 1217.34]  come behind
[1217.34 --> 1218.12]  him, we
[1218.12 --> 1219.92]  add to
[1219.92 --> 1220.84]  our faith.
[1220.84 --> 1220.90]  faith.
[1222.24 --> 1223.24]  It came
[1223.24 --> 1223.70]  to mean
[1223.70 --> 1224.80]  giving
[1224.80 --> 1225.78]  lavishly.
[1227.18 --> 1228.50]  We're to
[1228.50 --> 1229.64]  generously
[1229.64 --> 1230.76]  add to
[1230.76 --> 1231.58]  our faith.
[1232.64 --> 1233.04]  And what
[1233.04 --> 1233.46]  are we to
[1233.46 --> 1233.88]  add?
[1234.36 --> 1235.00]  These
[1235.00 --> 1236.40]  various
[1236.40 --> 1237.86]  attributes,
[1238.60 --> 1239.22]  qualities.
[1240.30 --> 1240.70]  So Peter
[1240.70 --> 1241.44]  gives a list
[1241.44 --> 1242.18]  of things
[1242.18 --> 1242.66]  we might
[1242.66 --> 1244.34]  add as
[1244.34 --> 1244.82]  we choose
[1244.82 --> 1245.56]  to do so.
[1245.56 --> 1247.10]  For
[1247.10 --> 1247.48]  example,
[1247.98 --> 1248.64]  he talks
[1248.64 --> 1248.88]  about
[1248.88 --> 1249.64]  goodness.
[1250.90 --> 1251.40]  That really
[1251.40 --> 1251.82]  means
[1251.82 --> 1252.78]  virtue.
[1254.38 --> 1255.30]  For
[1255.30 --> 1256.18]  moral
[1256.18 --> 1257.50]  fortitude
[1257.50 --> 1258.88]  or
[1258.88 --> 1260.56]  power or
[1260.56 --> 1261.46]  energy to
[1261.46 --> 1261.84]  do the
[1261.84 --> 1262.48]  right thing.
[1263.40 --> 1263.80]  Or to
[1263.80 --> 1264.54]  stir
[1264.54 --> 1265.58]  ourselves up
[1265.58 --> 1266.50]  and give
[1266.50 --> 1266.94]  due
[1266.94 --> 1267.64]  diligence
[1267.64 --> 1269.12]  in becoming
[1269.12 --> 1269.94]  a person
[1269.94 --> 1271.32]  of noble
[1271.32 --> 1272.38]  character.
[1273.22 --> 1273.44]  A
[1273.44 --> 1274.72]  virtuous,
[1274.72 --> 1276.18]  a good
[1276.18 --> 1277.38]  person.
[1278.22 --> 1278.72]  Add that
[1278.72 --> 1279.12]  to your
[1279.12 --> 1279.48]  faith.
[1280.28 --> 1280.92]  Because
[1280.92 --> 1281.76]  often we
[1281.76 --> 1282.28]  believers
[1282.28 --> 1284.38]  aren't always
[1284.38 --> 1284.90]  so good.
[1286.26 --> 1287.08]  And to
[1287.08 --> 1287.52]  goodness
[1287.52 --> 1288.26]  add
[1288.26 --> 1289.38]  knowledge.
[1289.76 --> 1290.04]  Now he's
[1290.04 --> 1290.56]  been talking
[1290.56 --> 1290.92]  about
[1290.92 --> 1291.84]  knowledge and
[1291.84 --> 1292.56]  that's part
[1292.56 --> 1292.96]  of what's
[1292.96 --> 1293.42]  involved,
[1293.54 --> 1294.60]  this knowing
[1294.60 --> 1295.48]  of Christ
[1295.48 --> 1295.88]  and who
[1295.88 --> 1296.42]  he is.
[1296.50 --> 1297.00]  But also
[1297.00 --> 1297.84]  part of
[1297.84 --> 1298.40]  that knowledge
[1298.40 --> 1299.40]  is practical
[1299.40 --> 1300.46]  insights.
[1300.74 --> 1301.12]  The more
[1301.12 --> 1301.66]  you work
[1301.66 --> 1302.42]  at something,
[1303.42 --> 1304.18]  the more
[1304.18 --> 1304.92]  you discover
[1304.92 --> 1305.96]  the ins
[1305.96 --> 1306.66]  and outs
[1306.66 --> 1307.46]  of it.
[1307.78 --> 1308.30]  And that's
[1308.30 --> 1308.58]  what's
[1308.58 --> 1308.94]  meant.
[1310.34 --> 1310.72]  Keep
[1310.72 --> 1311.24]  gaining
[1311.24 --> 1312.10]  practical
[1312.10 --> 1312.88]  insight
[1312.88 --> 1313.74]  in how
[1313.74 --> 1314.72]  to work
[1314.72 --> 1315.80]  out your
[1315.80 --> 1316.32]  faith
[1316.32 --> 1317.14]  in your
[1317.14 --> 1317.66]  setting.
[1319.36 --> 1319.60]  You know,
[1319.80 --> 1320.46]  learn those,
[1320.64 --> 1321.66]  as Dallas
[1321.66 --> 1322.26]  Willard says,
[1322.38 --> 1323.50]  tricks of the
[1323.50 --> 1324.16]  trade
[1324.16 --> 1325.26]  in being a
[1325.26 --> 1325.74]  disciple.
[1325.74 --> 1325.84]  people.
[1328.40 --> 1328.86]  Now all
[1328.86 --> 1329.20]  these
[1329.20 --> 1331.04]  attributes
[1331.04 --> 1331.76]  are really
[1331.76 --> 1332.70]  inside
[1332.70 --> 1333.72]  things that
[1333.72 --> 1334.40]  we're talking
[1334.40 --> 1335.18]  about because
[1335.18 --> 1336.24]  the vast
[1336.24 --> 1336.96]  majority of
[1336.96 --> 1337.38]  the work
[1337.38 --> 1337.80]  that we
[1337.80 --> 1338.30]  need to
[1338.30 --> 1339.20]  do is
[1339.20 --> 1339.96]  inside of
[1339.96 --> 1340.34]  us.
[1341.34 --> 1342.10]  Like
[1342.10 --> 1343.02]  self-control.
[1344.46 --> 1345.24]  In other
[1345.24 --> 1345.38]  words,
[1345.74 --> 1346.82]  watch out
[1346.82 --> 1347.96]  for your
[1347.96 --> 1348.66]  own
[1348.66 --> 1349.42]  soul,
[1349.90 --> 1350.40]  spiritual
[1350.40 --> 1351.04]  well-being.
[1352.14 --> 1352.72]  Manage
[1352.72 --> 1353.26]  your
[1353.26 --> 1354.12]  feelings
[1354.12 --> 1355.00]  well.
[1355.98 --> 1356.46]  Accept
[1356.46 --> 1356.82]  them for
[1356.82 --> 1357.24]  what they
[1357.24 --> 1357.62]  are,
[1358.62 --> 1359.34]  and then
[1359.34 --> 1360.34]  practice
[1360.34 --> 1361.42]  self-discipline
[1361.42 --> 1362.40]  as you
[1362.40 --> 1363.40]  respond to
[1363.40 --> 1364.28]  what's
[1364.28 --> 1364.78]  happening
[1364.78 --> 1365.70]  inside of
[1365.70 --> 1367.04]  you in
[1367.04 --> 1368.08]  healthy ways.
[1368.28 --> 1368.84]  It takes a
[1368.84 --> 1369.34]  lot of
[1369.34 --> 1370.58]  self-discipline,
[1370.66 --> 1371.18]  or what some
[1371.18 --> 1371.84]  have called
[1371.84 --> 1373.32]  self-leadership.
[1373.32 --> 1374.32]  self-discipline.
[1375.70 --> 1376.42]  And that
[1376.42 --> 1376.90]  takes
[1376.90 --> 1377.70]  perseverance.
[1380.38 --> 1381.28]  I come,
[1381.44 --> 1382.04]  as I think
[1382.04 --> 1382.34]  a number
[1382.34 --> 1382.60]  of you
[1382.60 --> 1383.60]  from Dutch
[1383.60 --> 1384.10]  background,
[1384.24 --> 1384.62]  we're known
[1384.62 --> 1384.98]  to be
[1384.98 --> 1385.36]  stubborn.
[1385.52 --> 1385.98]  This is a
[1385.98 --> 1386.44]  great way
[1386.44 --> 1386.76]  to be
[1386.76 --> 1387.14]  stubborn.
[1388.66 --> 1389.14]  Persevere
[1389.14 --> 1390.60]  at working
[1390.60 --> 1391.38]  at these
[1391.38 --> 1392.18]  heart issues
[1392.18 --> 1394.52]  in spite
[1394.52 --> 1395.20]  of obstacles
[1395.20 --> 1395.76]  that come
[1395.76 --> 1396.14]  along.
[1397.52 --> 1398.18]  It takes
[1398.18 --> 1398.98]  courage
[1398.98 --> 1400.16]  and endurance
[1400.16 --> 1401.34]  to keep
[1401.34 --> 1402.70]  stepping over
[1402.70 --> 1403.80]  these stones
[1403.80 --> 1404.68]  that are
[1404.68 --> 1405.20]  put in
[1405.20 --> 1405.78]  our path
[1405.78 --> 1406.28]  or happen
[1406.28 --> 1406.68]  to be
[1406.68 --> 1407.02]  there.
[1408.22 --> 1408.70]  But we
[1408.70 --> 1409.14]  do it,
[1409.22 --> 1409.74]  says Peter,
[1409.86 --> 1410.76]  we persevere
[1410.76 --> 1413.12]  because Christ
[1413.12 --> 1413.98]  calls us
[1413.98 --> 1415.30]  to godliness.
[1416.70 --> 1417.08]  Again,
[1417.28 --> 1418.34]  really that's
[1418.34 --> 1418.88]  the ultimate
[1418.88 --> 1419.44]  goal.
[1419.60 --> 1420.06]  This is the
[1420.06 --> 1420.38]  vision,
[1420.80 --> 1421.82]  to be like
[1421.82 --> 1422.44]  Christ,
[1423.58 --> 1424.04]  like we
[1424.04 --> 1424.42]  were in
[1424.42 --> 1425.00]  the beginning.
[1426.24 --> 1427.12]  God simply
[1427.12 --> 1427.64]  through his
[1427.64 --> 1428.00]  spirit
[1428.00 --> 1428.98]  retrofitting
[1428.98 --> 1430.20]  us back
[1430.20 --> 1431.24]  into the
[1431.24 --> 1431.92]  person of
[1431.92 --> 1432.50]  Christ.
[1432.70 --> 1434.06]  a godly
[1434.06 --> 1435.28]  person.
[1437.62 --> 1438.28]  On top
[1438.28 --> 1438.66]  of that,
[1438.72 --> 1439.10]  he says,
[1439.22 --> 1439.74]  make every
[1439.74 --> 1440.36]  effort to
[1440.36 --> 1442.14]  show mutual
[1442.14 --> 1443.56]  affection,
[1444.32 --> 1445.74]  to be
[1445.74 --> 1446.34]  warm
[1446.34 --> 1448.36]  and friendly
[1448.36 --> 1450.04]  to everyone,
[1450.30 --> 1451.14]  but especially
[1451.14 --> 1452.06]  to those
[1452.06 --> 1453.48]  in the
[1453.48 --> 1453.96]  family
[1453.96 --> 1455.30]  of God.
[1456.74 --> 1457.46]  My,
[1457.56 --> 1458.04]  that goes
[1458.04 --> 1458.58]  a long
[1458.58 --> 1460.16]  way in
[1460.16 --> 1460.92]  making for
[1460.92 --> 1461.56]  a very
[1461.56 --> 1462.34]  healthy
[1462.34 --> 1463.02]  church
[1463.02 --> 1463.92]  body,
[1464.92 --> 1465.52]  mutual
[1465.52 --> 1466.76]  affection.
[1468.12 --> 1468.92]  And the
[1468.92 --> 1469.58]  greatest of
[1469.58 --> 1470.26]  all virtues,
[1470.42 --> 1471.32]  whenever we
[1471.32 --> 1472.40]  hear them
[1472.40 --> 1473.58]  listed in
[1473.58 --> 1474.56]  various parts,
[1474.80 --> 1475.30]  particularly
[1475.30 --> 1476.42]  of the New
[1476.42 --> 1477.02]  Testament,
[1477.80 --> 1479.12]  is the call,
[1479.60 --> 1480.34]  which is at the
[1480.34 --> 1480.92]  core of what
[1480.92 --> 1481.56]  we're to be,
[1481.74 --> 1482.28]  the call
[1482.28 --> 1483.38]  to love,
[1483.38 --> 1486.12]  to love the
[1486.12 --> 1486.60]  Lord our
[1486.60 --> 1487.14]  God,
[1488.90 --> 1489.70]  with all our
[1489.70 --> 1490.48]  heart,
[1490.90 --> 1491.40]  soul,
[1492.06 --> 1492.50]  mind,
[1492.60 --> 1493.52]  and strength.
[1494.56 --> 1494.90]  Boy,
[1494.96 --> 1495.62]  there's a life
[1495.62 --> 1496.66]  goal I find
[1496.66 --> 1498.12]  that I'll never
[1498.12 --> 1499.00]  be done with.
[1499.96 --> 1501.12]  To love our
[1501.12 --> 1502.48]  neighbor as
[1502.48 --> 1503.18]  ourself.
[1505.12 --> 1506.36]  Without love,
[1506.36 --> 1508.46]  all those
[1508.46 --> 1509.24]  other virtues
[1509.24 --> 1511.16]  become vices.
[1512.38 --> 1513.58]  If we're not
[1513.58 --> 1514.18]  a loving
[1514.18 --> 1515.54]  person,
[1516.52 --> 1517.32]  then we
[1517.32 --> 1517.74]  can do
[1517.74 --> 1518.16]  good and
[1518.16 --> 1518.58]  all those
[1518.58 --> 1519.50]  things for
[1519.50 --> 1520.56]  selfish reasons.
[1521.32 --> 1522.12]  But if we're
[1522.12 --> 1523.18]  truly loving,
[1524.92 --> 1525.62]  then these
[1525.62 --> 1526.14]  virtues,
[1527.18 --> 1527.60]  these
[1527.60 --> 1528.96]  attributes,
[1529.70 --> 1530.20]  come out
[1530.20 --> 1530.66]  of us
[1530.66 --> 1532.18]  with integrity
[1532.18 --> 1534.18]  as part
[1534.18 --> 1534.60]  of our
[1534.60 --> 1535.52]  pursuit
[1535.52 --> 1536.30]  of what it
[1536.30 --> 1536.80]  is to
[1536.80 --> 1537.20]  live in
[1537.20 --> 1537.68]  Christ.
[1540.16 --> 1541.12]  Love keeps
[1541.12 --> 1541.94]  our motivation
[1541.94 --> 1542.66]  pure.
[1546.70 --> 1547.26]  Well,
[1547.58 --> 1548.50]  there's a lot
[1548.50 --> 1549.12]  to work on,
[1549.16 --> 1549.58]  isn't there?
[1550.18 --> 1550.84]  Maybe you're
[1550.84 --> 1551.68]  getting tired
[1551.68 --> 1553.04]  just thinking
[1553.04 --> 1553.62]  about all
[1553.62 --> 1554.04]  this,
[1555.22 --> 1555.62]  kind of
[1555.62 --> 1556.04]  tempting
[1556.04 --> 1557.72]  to give
[1557.72 --> 1559.24]  up and
[1559.24 --> 1559.90]  go on a
[1559.90 --> 1560.96]  long vacation.
[1562.88 --> 1563.56]  And so
[1563.56 --> 1564.10]  for added
[1564.10 --> 1564.76]  motivation,
[1564.96 --> 1565.46]  Peter gives
[1565.46 --> 1565.88]  a number
[1565.88 --> 1566.68]  of reasons
[1566.68 --> 1568.80]  for adding
[1568.80 --> 1569.32]  to these
[1569.32 --> 1569.82]  qualities.
[1570.06 --> 1570.54]  He says
[1570.54 --> 1571.20]  in verse
[1571.20 --> 1571.58]  8,
[1571.66 --> 1572.00]  if you
[1572.00 --> 1573.38]  possess
[1573.38 --> 1574.06]  these
[1574.06 --> 1574.84]  qualities
[1574.84 --> 1576.66]  in
[1576.66 --> 1577.38]  increasing
[1577.38 --> 1578.10]  measure,
[1578.32 --> 1580.30]  we're
[1580.30 --> 1580.82]  working at
[1580.82 --> 1581.22]  this,
[1582.26 --> 1582.52]  they'll
[1582.52 --> 1583.16]  keep you
[1583.16 --> 1583.74]  from being
[1583.74 --> 1584.46]  ineffective
[1584.46 --> 1585.56]  and unproductive
[1585.56 --> 1586.06]  in your
[1586.06 --> 1587.08]  knowledge of
[1587.08 --> 1587.52]  our Lord
[1587.52 --> 1588.54]  Jesus Christ.
[1590.30 --> 1590.86]  It helps
[1590.86 --> 1591.28]  to keep
[1591.28 --> 1592.10]  in mind
[1592.10 --> 1593.14]  that we
[1593.14 --> 1594.04]  possess it
[1594.04 --> 1594.80]  in increasing
[1594.80 --> 1595.54]  measure,
[1595.72 --> 1596.40]  that we're
[1596.40 --> 1596.86]  making
[1596.86 --> 1597.76]  slow,
[1597.96 --> 1598.34]  often
[1598.34 --> 1599.20]  incremental
[1599.20 --> 1600.44]  change,
[1600.54 --> 1600.98]  and so we
[1600.98 --> 1601.38]  need to be
[1601.38 --> 1602.12]  gracious and
[1602.12 --> 1602.78]  patient with
[1602.78 --> 1603.84]  ourselves,
[1604.62 --> 1605.26]  because negative
[1605.26 --> 1606.14]  habits rarely
[1606.14 --> 1606.76]  go away
[1606.76 --> 1607.30]  overnight.
[1607.46 --> 1607.74]  It does
[1607.74 --> 1608.20]  happen.
[1608.92 --> 1609.52]  I preached
[1609.52 --> 1610.04]  this sermon
[1610.04 --> 1610.68]  in Ladner,
[1610.74 --> 1611.20]  and a lady
[1611.20 --> 1612.00]  came up to me
[1612.00 --> 1612.28]  and she
[1612.28 --> 1612.96]  talked to me
[1612.96 --> 1613.56]  about how
[1613.56 --> 1614.44]  the Holy
[1614.44 --> 1615.30]  Spirit gave
[1615.30 --> 1615.92]  her a vision
[1615.92 --> 1616.80]  and her
[1616.80 --> 1618.30]  addiction to
[1618.30 --> 1619.30]  alcohol was
[1619.30 --> 1619.86]  gone.
[1620.96 --> 1621.56]  Been many
[1621.56 --> 1622.14]  years later,
[1622.42 --> 1623.32]  never again
[1623.32 --> 1624.06]  had a desire.
[1624.24 --> 1624.44]  Well,
[1624.58 --> 1625.40]  that's rare.
[1626.14 --> 1626.74]  Most often
[1626.74 --> 1628.60]  we have to
[1628.60 --> 1630.10]  work really
[1630.10 --> 1631.14]  hard,
[1631.98 --> 1632.66]  and we
[1632.66 --> 1633.82]  possess these
[1633.82 --> 1634.76]  qualities in
[1634.76 --> 1636.00]  increasing
[1636.00 --> 1637.32]  measure,
[1638.74 --> 1639.78]  daily turning
[1639.78 --> 1640.62]  to Christ,
[1640.78 --> 1641.40]  taking up
[1641.40 --> 1642.18]  our cross,
[1643.02 --> 1643.52]  deciding
[1643.52 --> 1644.04]  again,
[1644.44 --> 1645.58]  take the
[1645.58 --> 1646.20]  right step.
[1647.26 --> 1648.18]  And as we
[1648.18 --> 1649.22]  put good
[1649.22 --> 1650.54]  energy into
[1650.54 --> 1651.50]  this maturing
[1651.50 --> 1652.46]  process,
[1653.10 --> 1653.76]  says Peter,
[1654.12 --> 1654.70]  we'll see
[1654.70 --> 1655.34]  results.
[1656.60 --> 1657.30]  You'll see
[1657.30 --> 1657.94]  results.
[1659.72 --> 1660.56]  It'll keep
[1660.56 --> 1660.92]  you from
[1660.92 --> 1662.30]  being ineffective
[1662.30 --> 1663.88]  and unproductive
[1663.88 --> 1665.58]  in our faith.
[1667.28 --> 1668.10]  So keep
[1668.10 --> 1668.66]  at it.
[1669.36 --> 1669.76]  And then,
[1671.44 --> 1672.38]  it's good to
[1672.38 --> 1672.70]  see the
[1672.70 --> 1673.58]  negative side.
[1673.58 --> 1674.54]  if you're
[1674.54 --> 1674.76]  going to
[1674.76 --> 1675.80]  choose not
[1675.80 --> 1676.38]  to work
[1676.38 --> 1676.92]  at that
[1676.92 --> 1677.74]  and settle
[1677.74 --> 1678.18]  for the
[1678.18 --> 1679.10]  status quo,
[1679.90 --> 1680.18]  in other
[1680.18 --> 1680.36]  words,
[1680.48 --> 1681.56]  if you're
[1681.56 --> 1681.92]  the kind
[1681.92 --> 1682.26]  that says,
[1682.40 --> 1682.98]  I believe
[1682.98 --> 1683.58]  that's enough,
[1683.66 --> 1684.00]  it'll get
[1684.00 --> 1684.44]  me in.
[1685.72 --> 1686.46]  You should
[1686.46 --> 1687.20]  know then,
[1688.20 --> 1690.14]  as Peter
[1690.14 --> 1690.64]  says in
[1690.64 --> 1691.26]  verse 9,
[1691.92 --> 1692.28]  whoever
[1692.28 --> 1693.42]  doesn't
[1693.42 --> 1694.56]  have or
[1694.56 --> 1695.60]  work at
[1695.60 --> 1696.52]  these
[1696.52 --> 1697.34]  additives
[1697.34 --> 1698.04]  isn't
[1698.04 --> 1698.88]  interested in
[1698.88 --> 1699.40]  adding to
[1699.40 --> 1700.02]  their faith.
[1700.02 --> 1700.82]  they're
[1700.82 --> 1701.72]  near-sighted,
[1702.08 --> 1703.32]  they're
[1703.32 --> 1703.82]  blind,
[1704.50 --> 1705.18]  they've
[1705.18 --> 1705.60]  forgotten,
[1706.40 --> 1706.88]  they've
[1706.88 --> 1707.08]  been
[1707.08 --> 1707.78]  cleansed
[1707.78 --> 1708.52]  from their
[1708.52 --> 1709.48]  past sins.
[1711.48 --> 1712.52]  That's a
[1712.52 --> 1713.08]  little bit in
[1713.08 --> 1713.66]  our face,
[1713.72 --> 1714.22]  isn't it?
[1715.98 --> 1717.34]  A Christian
[1717.34 --> 1718.76]  who no
[1718.76 --> 1719.36]  longer
[1719.36 --> 1720.54]  intends
[1720.54 --> 1721.52]  to grow
[1721.52 --> 1723.72]  in Christ
[1723.72 --> 1724.84]  has done
[1724.84 --> 1725.68]  two things.
[1725.68 --> 1727.24]  they've
[1727.24 --> 1727.66]  lost
[1727.66 --> 1728.18]  sight
[1728.18 --> 1728.96]  of the
[1728.96 --> 1729.46]  future
[1729.46 --> 1730.06]  that
[1730.06 --> 1730.52]  Christ
[1730.52 --> 1731.12]  offers,
[1731.90 --> 1733.28]  and
[1733.28 --> 1733.86]  secondly,
[1734.06 --> 1734.42]  they have
[1734.42 --> 1734.94]  forgotten
[1734.94 --> 1735.60]  that their
[1735.60 --> 1736.02]  sinful
[1736.02 --> 1736.74]  past
[1736.74 --> 1737.86]  has been
[1737.86 --> 1738.38]  covered
[1738.38 --> 1739.26]  by the
[1739.26 --> 1739.48]  blood
[1739.48 --> 1740.14]  of Christ.
[1742.64 --> 1743.60]  Failure
[1743.60 --> 1744.80]  to pursue
[1744.80 --> 1746.10]  spiritual
[1746.10 --> 1746.80]  growth
[1746.80 --> 1748.20]  or maturity
[1748.20 --> 1749.48]  is a sign
[1749.48 --> 1750.40]  we've
[1750.40 --> 1750.92]  lost
[1750.92 --> 1752.14]  the vision
[1752.14 --> 1753.32]  and we've
[1753.32 --> 1753.80]  forgotten
[1753.80 --> 1755.02]  who we
[1755.02 --> 1755.96]  were or
[1755.96 --> 1756.44]  might have
[1756.44 --> 1756.78]  been
[1756.78 --> 1757.52]  without
[1757.52 --> 1758.16]  Christ.
[1759.72 --> 1761.02]  Because it's
[1761.02 --> 1761.40]  again,
[1761.56 --> 1762.40]  not possible
[1762.40 --> 1764.06]  to embrace
[1764.06 --> 1765.16]  a holy
[1765.16 --> 1765.82]  Christ
[1765.82 --> 1767.14]  and not
[1767.14 --> 1767.92]  want
[1767.92 --> 1769.18]  to be
[1769.18 --> 1769.50]  holy.
[1771.10 --> 1772.14]  That's
[1772.14 --> 1772.52]  God's
[1772.52 --> 1772.84]  goal
[1772.84 --> 1773.96]  and he
[1773.96 --> 1774.16]  will
[1774.16 --> 1774.62]  accomplish
[1774.62 --> 1774.96]  it.
[1776.10 --> 1776.80]  A
[1776.80 --> 1777.26]  Christian
[1777.26 --> 1777.90]  who could
[1777.90 --> 1779.06]  care less
[1779.06 --> 1779.68]  about
[1779.68 --> 1780.46]  furnishing
[1780.46 --> 1781.52]  or filling
[1781.52 --> 1782.22]  out
[1782.22 --> 1783.18]  their
[1783.18 --> 1783.66]  faith
[1783.66 --> 1784.16]  life
[1784.16 --> 1784.72]  has
[1784.72 --> 1785.28]  forgotten
[1785.28 --> 1786.22]  about
[1786.22 --> 1786.58]  the
[1786.58 --> 1787.84]  extravagant
[1787.84 --> 1788.48]  grace
[1788.48 --> 1789.62]  of God
[1789.62 --> 1790.20]  that
[1790.20 --> 1791.34]  invited us
[1791.34 --> 1792.18]  into this
[1792.18 --> 1792.96]  amazing
[1792.96 --> 1793.74]  kingdom
[1793.74 --> 1794.70]  of his.
[1798.40 --> 1799.24]  Alcoholics
[1799.24 --> 1799.70]  Anonymous
[1799.70 --> 1800.56]  has grasped
[1800.56 --> 1801.30]  the significance
[1801.30 --> 1801.86]  of this
[1801.86 --> 1802.26]  teaching.
[1802.42 --> 1802.80]  They have a
[1802.80 --> 1803.54]  sixth step
[1803.54 --> 1804.48]  and here's
[1804.48 --> 1804.94]  the sixth
[1804.94 --> 1805.28]  step
[1805.28 --> 1805.86]  of AA.
[1805.86 --> 1806.04]  AA.
[1807.80 --> 1808.98]  We are
[1808.98 --> 1809.88]  entirely
[1809.88 --> 1811.24]  ready to
[1811.24 --> 1812.12]  have God
[1812.12 --> 1813.60]  remove all
[1813.60 --> 1814.72]  these defects
[1814.72 --> 1815.84]  of character.
[1817.70 --> 1818.58]  Want to
[1818.58 --> 1819.08]  join AA?
[1819.68 --> 1820.26]  Oh my.
[1820.60 --> 1820.92]  We are
[1820.92 --> 1822.06]  entirely ready
[1822.06 --> 1822.80]  to have God
[1822.80 --> 1823.84]  remove all
[1823.84 --> 1824.64]  these defects
[1824.64 --> 1825.28]  of character.
[1827.36 --> 1827.76]  And then
[1827.76 --> 1828.12]  they have a
[1828.12 --> 1828.60]  little paragraph
[1828.60 --> 1829.84]  of explanation
[1829.84 --> 1830.50]  in this book
[1830.50 --> 1831.18]  I have at home.
[1831.54 --> 1832.32]  It explains,
[1832.32 --> 1833.44]  it seems
[1833.44 --> 1834.48]  plain that
[1834.48 --> 1835.38]  few of us
[1835.38 --> 1836.12]  can quickly
[1836.12 --> 1836.92]  or easily
[1836.92 --> 1837.78]  become ready
[1837.78 --> 1838.64]  to aim
[1838.64 --> 1839.84]  at spiritual
[1839.84 --> 1840.70]  and moral
[1840.70 --> 1841.54]  perfection.
[1842.78 --> 1843.82]  We want
[1843.82 --> 1844.46]  to settle
[1844.46 --> 1845.60]  for only
[1845.60 --> 1846.32]  as much
[1846.32 --> 1847.12]  perfection
[1847.12 --> 1848.60]  as will
[1848.60 --> 1849.48]  get us
[1849.48 --> 1850.20]  by
[1850.20 --> 1851.42]  in life
[1851.42 --> 1852.32]  according
[1852.32 --> 1853.08]  of course
[1853.08 --> 1853.80]  to our
[1853.80 --> 1854.54]  various and
[1854.54 --> 1855.48]  sundry ideas
[1855.48 --> 1856.06]  of what will
[1856.06 --> 1856.48]  get us
[1856.48 --> 1856.84]  by.
[1857.44 --> 1858.34]  So the
[1858.34 --> 1858.76]  difference
[1858.76 --> 1859.32]  between,
[1859.72 --> 1860.02]  pardon their
[1860.02 --> 1860.46]  language,
[1860.62 --> 1861.12]  the difference
[1861.12 --> 1861.80]  between the
[1861.80 --> 1862.74]  boys and
[1862.74 --> 1863.32]  the men
[1863.32 --> 1864.00]  is the
[1864.00 --> 1864.44]  difference
[1864.44 --> 1864.94]  between
[1864.94 --> 1865.64]  striving
[1865.64 --> 1866.58]  for a
[1866.58 --> 1868.08]  self-determined
[1868.08 --> 1868.86]  objective
[1868.86 --> 1869.82]  and for
[1869.82 --> 1870.72]  the perfect
[1870.72 --> 1871.42]  objective
[1871.42 --> 1872.44]  which is
[1872.44 --> 1873.12]  of God,
[1873.44 --> 1874.04]  which is
[1874.04 --> 1874.60]  Christ,
[1874.82 --> 1875.36]  who is
[1875.36 --> 1875.90]  our vision.
[1880.26 --> 1880.90]  Negative
[1880.90 --> 1881.46]  side.
[1881.62 --> 1881.96]  If you
[1881.96 --> 1882.44]  don't work
[1882.44 --> 1882.88]  at it,
[1883.96 --> 1884.60]  you've
[1884.60 --> 1885.04]  lost your
[1885.04 --> 1885.38]  vision.
[1886.80 --> 1887.48]  Peter adds
[1887.48 --> 1887.96]  three more
[1887.96 --> 1888.84]  positive reasons
[1888.84 --> 1889.18]  and then
[1889.18 --> 1889.60]  we're done.
[1890.02 --> 1890.36]  And I
[1890.36 --> 1890.76]  won't dwell
[1890.76 --> 1891.30]  long on
[1891.30 --> 1891.50]  them.
[1893.00 --> 1893.90]  But three
[1893.90 --> 1894.60]  more positive
[1894.60 --> 1895.22]  reasons for
[1895.22 --> 1896.08]  being intentional
[1896.08 --> 1896.78]  about adding
[1896.78 --> 1897.46]  to our
[1897.46 --> 1897.82]  faith.
[1898.44 --> 1898.76]  In verse
[1898.76 --> 1899.14]  10 and
[1899.14 --> 1899.46]  11,
[1899.56 --> 1900.00]  my brothers
[1900.00 --> 1900.60]  and sisters
[1900.60 --> 1901.28]  make every
[1901.28 --> 1902.66]  effort to
[1902.66 --> 1903.80]  confirm your
[1903.80 --> 1904.64]  calling and
[1904.64 --> 1905.22]  election.
[1905.66 --> 1905.86]  Boy,
[1905.94 --> 1906.24]  we could
[1906.24 --> 1906.96]  talk long
[1906.96 --> 1907.98]  about that.
[1908.48 --> 1909.10]  Because if
[1909.10 --> 1909.50]  you do
[1909.50 --> 1910.42]  these things,
[1910.46 --> 1911.20]  you'll never
[1911.20 --> 1913.24]  stumble and
[1913.24 --> 1913.70]  you will
[1913.70 --> 1914.46]  receive a
[1914.46 --> 1915.32]  rich welcome
[1915.32 --> 1916.12]  into the
[1916.12 --> 1916.64]  eternal
[1916.64 --> 1917.94]  kingdom of
[1917.94 --> 1918.50]  our Lord
[1918.50 --> 1919.22]  and Savior
[1919.22 --> 1920.44]  Jesus Christ.
[1921.18 --> 1921.74]  Verse 10
[1921.74 --> 1922.24]  and 11.
[1922.56 --> 1923.16]  So adding
[1923.16 --> 1923.78]  to our
[1923.78 --> 1924.40]  faith does
[1924.40 --> 1924.92]  these three
[1924.92 --> 1925.46]  things.
[1926.26 --> 1927.84]  It confirms
[1927.84 --> 1929.56]  in us
[1929.56 --> 1930.76]  that the
[1930.76 --> 1931.30]  sovereign
[1931.30 --> 1932.84]  electing God
[1932.84 --> 1934.10]  is actually
[1934.10 --> 1934.94]  at work
[1934.94 --> 1935.42]  in us.
[1936.42 --> 1936.82]  You know,
[1936.88 --> 1937.36]  when you get
[1937.36 --> 1938.02]  in the game
[1938.02 --> 1938.52]  and you go
[1938.52 --> 1939.02]  around the
[1939.02 --> 1939.92]  bases once,
[1940.06 --> 1940.90]  you know
[1940.90 --> 1941.34]  you're on
[1941.34 --> 1941.80]  the team.
[1943.86 --> 1944.58]  It will
[1944.58 --> 1945.24]  keep us
[1945.24 --> 1945.70]  secondly
[1945.70 --> 1946.82]  from stumbling
[1946.82 --> 1947.92]  in our
[1947.92 --> 1948.46]  walk with
[1948.46 --> 1949.60]  God and
[1949.60 --> 1950.32]  thirdly,
[1950.32 --> 1950.98]  will lead
[1950.98 --> 1951.74]  to a warm
[1951.74 --> 1952.36]  welcome
[1952.36 --> 1954.28]  into God's
[1954.28 --> 1955.14]  eternal
[1955.14 --> 1955.94]  kingdom.
[1958.94 --> 1959.58]  See,
[1959.74 --> 1960.38]  what God
[1960.38 --> 1961.40]  does and
[1961.40 --> 1962.24]  what we do
[1962.24 --> 1962.70]  are meant
[1962.70 --> 1963.46]  to complement
[1963.46 --> 1964.28]  each other.
[1964.40 --> 1964.78]  I remember
[1964.78 --> 1965.38]  our history
[1965.38 --> 1966.16]  professor when
[1966.16 --> 1966.82]  he was talking
[1966.82 --> 1967.34]  about the
[1967.34 --> 1968.46]  debates in
[1968.46 --> 1968.98]  the church,
[1969.44 --> 1969.80]  you know,
[1969.92 --> 1971.22]  about man
[1971.22 --> 1971.74]  and God
[1971.74 --> 1972.12]  and what's
[1972.12 --> 1972.68]  the balance.
[1972.78 --> 1973.08]  He would
[1973.08 --> 1973.64]  say it's
[1973.64 --> 1974.98]  not 50-50,
[1975.16 --> 1976.00]  it's 100%
[1976.00 --> 1977.12]  and 100%.
[1977.12 --> 1980.40]  God draws
[1980.40 --> 1980.80]  us,
[1981.18 --> 1981.80]  calls us
[1981.80 --> 1982.54]  to himself
[1982.54 --> 1983.34]  through the
[1983.34 --> 1983.86]  good and
[1983.86 --> 1984.90]  glorious person
[1984.90 --> 1985.98]  of Christ.
[1986.12 --> 1986.60]  He's the
[1986.60 --> 1987.60]  proactive
[1987.60 --> 1989.10]  initiator
[1989.10 --> 1990.06]  of all
[1990.06 --> 1990.68]  of this
[1990.68 --> 1991.20]  redemption
[1991.20 --> 1992.06]  and we
[1992.06 --> 1992.74]  are to be
[1992.74 --> 1993.42]  the fully
[1993.42 --> 1994.42]  reactive
[1994.42 --> 1995.76]  responders
[1995.76 --> 1997.12]  to what
[1997.12 --> 1997.76]  God has
[1997.76 --> 1998.38]  done for
[1998.38 --> 1999.14]  us by
[1999.14 --> 1999.76]  believing
[1999.76 --> 2000.40]  in Jesus
[2000.40 --> 2001.44]  and then
[2001.44 --> 2001.88]  following
[2001.88 --> 2002.28]  him,
[2003.32 --> 2003.78]  fully
[2003.78 --> 2004.46]  intent
[2004.46 --> 2005.44]  on adding
[2005.44 --> 2006.22]  these qualities.
[2007.62 --> 2008.14]  And when
[2008.14 --> 2008.64]  we do
[2008.64 --> 2009.04]  that,
[2009.50 --> 2010.70]  it confirms
[2010.70 --> 2011.70]  God's
[2011.70 --> 2012.42]  at work
[2012.42 --> 2012.94]  in us,
[2013.42 --> 2014.12]  we're tracking
[2014.12 --> 2014.72]  with him,
[2015.36 --> 2015.74]  he's got
[2015.74 --> 2016.36]  our destiny
[2016.36 --> 2017.00]  in mind.
[2018.42 --> 2019.18]  And the
[2019.18 --> 2019.72]  more we
[2019.72 --> 2021.00]  apply ourselves,
[2021.22 --> 2021.64]  the more
[2021.64 --> 2022.80]  we become
[2022.80 --> 2023.50]  confident,
[2024.50 --> 2025.62]  the more
[2025.62 --> 2026.26]  you practice
[2026.26 --> 2026.98]  your faith
[2026.98 --> 2027.48]  like with
[2027.48 --> 2028.24]  anything else.
[2028.24 --> 2029.76]  The more
[2029.76 --> 2030.30]  you play
[2030.30 --> 2031.06]  baseball or
[2031.06 --> 2031.56]  basketball,
[2031.76 --> 2032.12]  the better
[2032.12 --> 2032.62]  you get
[2032.62 --> 2033.40]  at it.
[2033.84 --> 2034.74]  The stronger
[2034.74 --> 2035.54]  you become,
[2035.66 --> 2036.04]  the less
[2036.04 --> 2036.66]  likely you
[2036.66 --> 2037.02]  are to
[2037.02 --> 2038.02]  make mistakes.
[2039.94 --> 2040.88]  The less
[2040.88 --> 2041.52]  likely we
[2041.52 --> 2042.06]  will fall
[2042.06 --> 2042.44]  in our
[2042.44 --> 2043.18]  Christian life,
[2043.26 --> 2043.90]  the more
[2043.90 --> 2044.38]  we work
[2044.38 --> 2044.88]  at it.
[2045.44 --> 2046.12]  And then
[2046.12 --> 2047.04]  as our
[2047.04 --> 2047.76]  day draws
[2047.76 --> 2048.14]  near,
[2049.44 --> 2051.86]  and COVID
[2051.86 --> 2052.44]  comes,
[2052.44 --> 2053.16]  death
[2053.16 --> 2053.70]  threatens,
[2053.70 --> 2055.96]  we get
[2055.96 --> 2056.60]  assured in
[2056.60 --> 2057.16]  our heart
[2057.16 --> 2058.44]  that it
[2058.44 --> 2058.94]  doesn't matter
[2058.94 --> 2059.56]  what happens,
[2059.60 --> 2060.14]  in the end,
[2060.24 --> 2060.78]  we've got a
[2060.78 --> 2061.94]  warm welcome
[2061.94 --> 2063.02]  for us
[2063.02 --> 2064.22]  from our
[2064.22 --> 2064.62]  God
[2064.62 --> 2065.62]  into an
[2065.62 --> 2065.98]  eternal
[2065.98 --> 2066.42]  home.
[2067.42 --> 2068.10]  And the
[2068.10 --> 2068.52]  more we
[2068.52 --> 2068.88]  pursue
[2068.88 --> 2069.42]  Christ,
[2069.54 --> 2069.82]  the more
[2069.82 --> 2070.74]  this deep
[2070.74 --> 2071.24]  hope
[2071.24 --> 2072.60]  gets planted
[2072.60 --> 2073.12]  in our
[2073.12 --> 2073.50]  soul
[2073.50 --> 2075.88]  that I,
[2076.12 --> 2076.36]  we,
[2076.56 --> 2077.10]  will be
[2077.10 --> 2077.60]  welcomed
[2077.60 --> 2078.12]  home
[2078.12 --> 2079.18]  someday.
[2079.18 --> 2081.32]  pray with
[2081.32 --> 2081.60]  me.
[2083.46 --> 2084.26]  Lord,
[2084.36 --> 2084.76]  your word
[2084.76 --> 2085.90]  reminds us
[2085.90 --> 2086.84]  and your
[2086.84 --> 2087.36]  sacrament
[2087.36 --> 2088.38]  will soon
[2088.38 --> 2089.08]  confirm
[2089.08 --> 2089.88]  this
[2089.88 --> 2091.30]  wonderful
[2091.30 --> 2092.26]  truth
[2092.26 --> 2092.78]  that we
[2092.78 --> 2093.54]  are on
[2093.54 --> 2094.66]  the path
[2094.66 --> 2095.82]  that leads
[2095.82 --> 2097.36]  to a
[2097.36 --> 2098.14]  long life
[2098.14 --> 2098.86]  with you,
[2099.46 --> 2099.84]  a life
[2099.84 --> 2100.24]  forever.
[2102.04 --> 2102.46]  May we
[2102.46 --> 2103.26]  never forget
[2103.26 --> 2104.36]  that we
[2104.36 --> 2104.80]  have been
[2104.80 --> 2105.46]  cleansed
[2105.46 --> 2105.94]  from our
[2105.94 --> 2106.28]  sins
[2106.28 --> 2107.20]  and declared
[2107.20 --> 2108.04]  your saints.
[2109.18 --> 2109.68]  Now help
[2109.68 --> 2110.12]  us to
[2110.12 --> 2110.56]  live more
[2110.56 --> 2111.34]  like saints,
[2112.30 --> 2112.66]  pursuing
[2112.66 --> 2113.36]  purity
[2113.36 --> 2113.86]  and the
[2113.86 --> 2114.30]  holiness
[2114.30 --> 2115.06]  that comes
[2115.06 --> 2115.70]  from you,
[2116.32 --> 2117.60]  Holy Spirit.
[2119.06 --> 2119.92]  Give us
[2119.92 --> 2120.52]  the grace
[2120.52 --> 2121.32]  to continually
[2121.32 --> 2122.04]  name our
[2122.04 --> 2122.60]  sin and
[2122.60 --> 2123.20]  the courage
[2123.20 --> 2123.60]  and the
[2123.60 --> 2124.12]  conviction
[2124.12 --> 2124.94]  to add
[2124.94 --> 2125.40]  to our
[2125.40 --> 2126.88]  faith so
[2126.88 --> 2127.50]  we become
[2127.50 --> 2128.10]  more and
[2128.10 --> 2128.78]  more what
[2128.78 --> 2129.16]  you have
[2129.16 --> 2129.72]  redeemed
[2129.72 --> 2130.68]  and called
[2130.68 --> 2131.54]  us to
[2131.54 --> 2132.04]  become,
[2132.90 --> 2134.46]  just like
[2134.46 --> 2134.72]  you.
[2135.92 --> 2136.70]  We pray
[2136.70 --> 2137.28]  this in the
[2137.28 --> 2137.80]  name of
[2137.80 --> 2138.20]  Jesus,
[2138.52 --> 2139.20]  our Savior
[2139.20 --> 2140.34]  and for
[2140.34 --> 2141.12]  his sake.
[2141.86 --> 2142.26]  Amen.
