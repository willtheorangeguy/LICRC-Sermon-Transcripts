[0.00 → 5.24] It's good to be here with you all today.
[6.02 → 10.06] We've been spending the last number of weeks in the Book of Genesis, a lot of time in the
[10.06 → 11.84] Book of Genesis lately, and that's been great.
[12.30 → 15.42] Pastor Bert Schlosser is leading us through a wonderful sermon series on Joseph.
[16.20 → 20.46] But today I'd like to pivot and just take a break from Genesis for a service, and we're
[20.46 → 22.00] going to look at the New Testament today.
[23.04 → 26.70] One of the discussion points that dominates the conversations that I get to have with
[26.70 → 30.74] young people in this church and in my job is relationships.
[31.86 → 37.76] Relationships with parents, relationships with siblings, relationships with friends, and
[37.76 → 40.24] believe it or not, relationships with spouses.
[41.88 → 46.02] Marriage undergirds a lot of those conversations.
[47.08 → 51.82] For many of us, especially adults, if not all of us adults, marriage is something that is
[51.82 → 53.34] on the forefront of our minds.
[53.34 → 56.96] Whether we are married and struggling in our marriage, or we're married and things
[56.96 → 62.50] are going great, and we're growing in our relationship, or if we are single and wondering what God has
[62.50 → 65.70] in store for us and our marriage status.
[67.04 → 70.34] There are a lot of passages in the Bible about marriage.
[71.54 → 75.10] But what does the Bible say about being single?
[76.38 → 78.48] Our text today is going to speak to that.
[78.48 → 84.20] It comes from 1 Corinthians 7, verses 25 to 38, and we're going to read that in just a moment.
[84.28 → 87.72] So please, if you've got your Bibles with you, if you're watching online, open them up right now,
[87.74 → 89.80] and you can turn to 1 Corinthians 7 and read with me.
[90.00 → 94.14] I love this passage, not just because of the topic that it preaches on, or it teaches us on,
[94.44 → 96.48] because I love the way that Paul writes.
[96.88 → 100.68] And you'll see as we read this passage, it almost sounds a little bit awkward to our Western minds.
[100.72 → 105.72] Like he's trying to, like, rephrase things over and over again, because he can't quite get what he wants to say out.
[105.72 → 113.66] But in light of that, I find this passage so important, and there's so much truth that our churches right now need to hear.
[114.18 → 117.30] And, so please read this passage with me.
[117.36 → 120.04] 1 Corinthians 7, 28 to 38, says this.
[121.46 → 126.42] Now about virgins, which we will come to learn in a little bit, means the single person.
[126.98 → 133.94] Now about virgins, I have no command from the Lord, but I give a judgment as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy.
[133.94 → 137.66] Because of the present crisis, we'll get back to that.
[137.72 → 142.56] Because of the present crisis, I think that it is good for a man to remain as he is.
[143.10 → 145.98] Are you pledged to a woman? Do not seek to be released.
[146.66 → 150.26] Are you free from such commitment? Do not look for a wife.
[150.58 → 152.60] But if you do marry, you have not sinned.
[152.72 → 154.70] And if a virgin marries, she has not sinned.
[155.08 → 158.26] But those who marry will face many troubles in this life.
[158.26 → 159.52] And I want to spare you of this.
[160.10 → 164.28] What I mean, brothers and sisters, is that the time is short.
[165.38 → 168.68] From now on, those who have wives should live as if they do not.
[168.78 → 170.70] Those who mourn as if they did not.
[170.98 → 172.68] Those who are happy as if they were not.
[172.94 → 175.64] Those who buy something as if it were not theirs to keep.
[175.92 → 179.60] Those who use the things of this world as if not engrossed in them.
[180.30 → 184.26] For this world, in its present form, is passing away.
[185.32 → 186.48] Hold on to that as well.
[186.48 → 189.72] I would like to free you from concern.
[190.82 → 193.44] An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs.
[193.68 → 195.24] How he can please the Lord.
[196.04 → 199.04] But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world.
[199.22 → 200.60] How he can please his wife.
[201.00 → 203.02] And his interests are divided.
[203.76 → 205.74] Paul then uses the example again.
[206.60 → 210.22] An unmarried woman or a virgin is concerned about the Lord's affairs.
[210.34 → 213.46] Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both body and spirit.
[213.46 → 217.50] But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world.
[217.88 → 219.44] How she can please her husband.
[219.44 → 222.40] I am saying this for your own good.
[222.40 → 224.12] Not to restrict you.
[224.40 → 231.14] But that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord.
[232.88 → 237.62] If anyone is worried that he might not be acting honourably toward the virgin he is engaged to.
[237.78 → 239.30] And if his passions are too strong.
[239.40 → 240.72] And he feels he ought to marry.
[241.12 → 242.30] He should do as he wants.
[242.58 → 243.76] He is not sinning.
[244.00 → 245.06] They should get married.
[245.06 → 248.74] But the man who has settled the matter in his own mind.
[248.86 → 250.24] Who is under no compulsion.
[250.42 → 252.08] But has control over his own will.
[252.26 → 254.64] And who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin.
[255.84 → 258.86] This man also does the right thing.
[260.30 → 261.20] So then.
[262.06 → 264.24] He who marries the virgin does right.
[265.24 → 267.14] But he who does not marry her.
[267.92 → 268.56] Does better.
[269.94 → 270.94] The word of the Lord.
[272.32 → 274.26] That is a fascinating text.
[274.34 → 274.72] Isn't it?
[275.38 → 275.82] Fascinating.
[276.84 → 282.86] Now quality biblically based literature on the topic of Christian singleness is hard to find.
[282.96 → 284.28] If you go to Indigo Books.
[284.52 → 286.42] Or you search on Amazon.ca.
[286.94 → 289.70] About books on being a Christian single.
[290.06 → 292.46] You'll find that the subject seems to go one of two directions.
[293.42 → 296.00] You're either going to find books that say that marriage is the worst.
[296.10 → 297.98] And you should do everything in your way not to get married.
[298.28 → 302.64] Or you're going to find a sort of meat market self-help book.
[302.64 → 305.80] On quick and easy formulas to find that perfect mate.
[307.06 → 308.42] The problem is.
[309.60 → 312.44] Neither of those options really get to the heart.
[312.86 → 314.62] Of what it means to be single.
[314.86 → 315.92] And a Christ follower.
[315.92 → 322.08] Now admittedly there's actually not a ton in the Bible on Christian singleness.
[322.56 → 323.98] There's the passage we just read.
[324.46 → 326.58] And there's a section in Matthew 19.
[326.90 → 328.20] That actually talks about divorce.
[328.30 → 329.84] But talks about singleness as well.
[329.98 → 331.72] And we'll touch on that a little bit later.
[331.72 → 336.18] But singleness is a very complex topic in the church.
[336.30 → 340.40] And it's a focal point of many conversations that I personally have end up having.
[340.56 → 344.94] So what does it mean to be single in the church today?
[346.48 → 349.44] Is singleness desired by God?
[349.44 → 353.84] Before we dig too deeply into these questions.
[353.84 → 355.60] We need to define a few terms.
[355.78 → 359.02] Now there are three words that I'd like to sort of solidify our understanding.
[359.16 → 363.10] Or at least come to a conclusion or unanimous conclusion to what they mean.
[363.16 → 364.14] Those three words are this.
[364.80 → 365.90] Virginity or virgin.
[366.98 → 368.26] Celibacy or celibate.
[368.98 → 370.18] And single or singleness.
[371.24 → 372.66] So virgin or virginity.
[372.80 → 373.66] It's found in the Bible.
[373.74 → 375.90] And it's often referencing women.
[376.06 → 377.02] But also men.
[377.02 → 382.36] And it's most often used in the Bible to qualify the unmarried person.
[383.02 → 384.56] Like it does in our text today.
[385.72 → 388.30] The word celibate or celibacy then.
[388.70 → 393.40] Is a term that's used to describe someone who has chosen to remain single.
[393.86 → 395.80] Now that posture of choice is very important.
[396.20 → 399.08] If someone is celibate, or they are practicing celibacy.
[399.28 → 401.84] They have chosen to remain single.
[402.94 → 405.86] To be single or singleness, however.
[405.86 → 408.14] Is not a matter of one's choosing.
[408.68 → 413.04] It's simply the word used to define those who are unmarried.
[413.88 → 416.18] It's sort of the new way of saying virgin in the Bible.
[416.30 → 418.38] So celibacy is choosing to be single.
[418.70 → 421.28] Being single is simply being single.
[421.50 → 422.28] That's the difference there.
[422.32 → 422.84] Does that make sense?
[423.10 → 423.80] A few head nods.
[424.08 → 424.50] We're following.
[424.60 → 424.98] Because that's going to be.
[425.04 → 426.14] I'm going to be using these words a lot.
[426.26 → 426.68] So if we are.
[426.76 → 427.70] We got a track with those.
[428.06 → 428.30] Perfect.
[428.30 → 431.00] Now there's a fascinating comparison.
[431.12 → 434.76] Between the contemporary cultural view of these words.
[435.08 → 436.88] And the church's view of these words.
[437.78 → 439.18] In western culture today.
[439.28 → 439.88] Think about this.
[440.04 → 442.92] Singleness is viewed with respect.
[443.92 → 446.84] People are getting married later and later in life in our culture.
[446.84 → 450.52] And generally the idea of looking out for number one.
[450.62 → 451.50] Looking out for yourself.
[451.70 → 453.68] Still reigns very true in our culture.
[454.34 → 458.38] The strong, independent, I need no one else person.
[458.66 → 462.74] Is very, very much valued in our world today.
[463.98 → 465.82] However, though that part is true.
[466.40 → 469.86] Remaining single is praised in our contemporary culture.
[469.86 → 474.36] However, celibacy or virginity is not.
[475.16 → 477.30] Just watch any sitcom on TV.
[480.22 → 484.24] Our culture views virginity as something that needs to be done away with.
[484.32 → 485.64] Something that needs to be lost.
[486.80 → 489.14] And if you choose a life of celibacy.
[489.94 → 494.00] Well, you are weirder than an ostrich in a swimsuit.
[496.30 → 498.48] In western culture, single is good.
[498.48 → 503.82] But celibate or virgin is bad.
[505.72 → 508.20] In the church, though, in a very broad sense.
[509.28 → 511.52] We kind of have the exact opposite feeling.
[511.98 → 514.82] We, if you're unmarried, we praise you for being a virgin.
[514.96 → 516.44] We praise you for that.
[516.64 → 518.64] Because that's what the Bible says.
[518.72 → 519.38] We applaud that.
[519.46 → 520.24] We encourage that.
[520.28 → 520.84] And that's good.
[521.16 → 525.46] Yet in the church, for some reason, singleness is not praised.
[525.46 → 533.62] Marriage is still pushed on people to the point where singleness is seen as undervalued and not worth pursuing.
[534.38 → 541.60] In many Christians' eyes, remaining single well into one's 30s or beyond is a problem that needs solving.
[541.60 → 547.66] Not an opportunity to serve God in a multitude of unique ways.
[547.66 → 553.36] And the church's view on singleness in that light is a problem.
[553.36 → 556.54] There's a ripple effect to this mindset.
[556.54 → 567.12] In the book Singled Out, authors Cologne and Field, they suggest that this anti-single mindset within the church, it's causing all sorts of problems.
[567.12 → 571.94] Especially when relating it to people who have been divorced or people who struggle with homosexuality.
[572.46 → 574.54] They say in this book, these authors, they say this.
[574.54 → 585.14] Rather than being seen as a wonderful opportunity to serve God, celibacy is repeatedly seen as not only second best, but also a guarantee of an unfulfilled and miserable life.
[585.50 → 598.66] How do we expect those who struggle with homosexuality or those recovering from divorce to see celibacy as a positive option when it is not seen as a valued alternative for other singles?
[598.66 → 606.44] Now today we don't have time to look at the homosexuality or the divorce discussion, sadly.
[607.30 → 611.70] But that quote highlights the Western church's view on singleness very well.
[612.08 → 614.62] Marriage is viewed as the preferred lifestyle within the church.
[614.94 → 616.76] And singleness is lamentable.
[616.92 → 618.40] Something that we need to solve.
[618.70 → 621.02] Something that we need to fix.
[622.88 → 625.02] But the Bible says otherwise.
[625.68 → 627.38] Just look at what Paul says in our text today.
[627.38 → 634.94] Whittled down to the tiniest of sentences, Paul basically says that it's cool to get married, but it might be more beneficial to remain single.
[636.54 → 638.00] So why does Paul say that?
[640.20 → 645.86] You'll notice in our text that Paul writes of an impending crisis, which he mentions right at the top in verse 26.
[646.54 → 654.08] He says to this church, in order to live free of distractions during this crisis, it would be better to remain single.
[654.08 → 657.56] So what crisis is Paul speaking of?
[659.18 → 662.26] Sadly, the truth is no one's absolutely certain.
[662.82 → 669.18] Historically, though, a huge famine came over the whole Mediterranean area pretty soon after Paul wrote this letter.
[669.62 → 671.18] So many people think it could be that.
[671.58 → 675.90] It's possible that Paul is referencing pagan culture in general in the area,
[675.90 → 679.56] or maybe something else specific to the Corinth church that we don't know about.
[680.86 → 687.36] Scholars also believe, and I tend to land on this too, that Paul could be speaking about Christ's second coming.
[687.70 → 691.56] Where Christ will come to judge those too distracted to follow them.
[692.16 → 696.52] And if you read verses 29 to 31, and especially verse 31 in our text,
[696.90 → 700.72] it does seem like Paul's speaking of Christ's second coming.
[700.72 → 706.82] T. Wright, a scholar, he says this, and I think most scholars believe this,
[707.36 → 710.80] Paul is referring both to this immediate crisis,
[711.18 → 714.58] and to the fact that it points forward to the ultimate crisis,
[715.12 → 716.50] the time of the Lord's return.
[717.14 → 720.40] So even if the current crisis suddenly passes, let's say it was a famine,
[720.70 → 722.58] even if the current crisis suddenly passes,
[722.84 → 726.72] if wonderful crops and plentiful food again flood the markets of Corinth,
[726.72 → 731.86] and everywhere else, there will still be the final crisis to face.
[733.94 → 736.80] Now if that's the case, and again most scholars believe that,
[737.16 → 740.88] then Paul's point of singleness cannot be squarely meant
[740.88 → 744.26] about a crisis that only Corinth was to face.
[745.40 → 748.18] But it's for all of us, the whole church,
[748.56 → 751.22] who await Christ's second coming.
[751.22 → 754.10] And so Paul says that in light of this famine,
[754.28 → 756.72] and with the knowledge of Christ's second coming at hand,
[757.04 → 761.38] it is better for us all to remain without distraction.
[763.14 → 765.68] And while getting married is all fine and well,
[767.14 → 769.70] remaining single is best.
[772.90 → 775.26] It becomes easy then to read this text
[775.26 → 777.40] and assume that Paul might be anti-marriage.
[777.40 → 779.68] But earlier in this very chapter,
[780.38 → 782.86] in 1 Corinthians chapter 7, verses 2 to 5,
[782.92 → 784.14] if you've got your Bibles, you can read that,
[784.22 → 786.56] Paul speaks about how two should become one.
[787.04 → 788.24] In other letters Paul writes,
[788.32 → 789.96] he gives instructions for healthy marriages,
[790.12 → 792.46] like in Colossians 3 or Ephesians 5
[792.46 → 794.70] or 1 Timothy 2 or Titus 2.
[795.50 → 797.14] The apostle Peter, Paul's buddy,
[797.46 → 799.96] he also speaks to healthy marriages in 1 Peter 2.
[800.12 → 802.96] And God himself ordains marriage
[802.96 → 805.38] right at the beginning of time in Genesis 2.
[805.38 → 808.48] So the Bible very clearly shows us
[808.48 → 810.42] that marriage matters to Paul,
[810.86 → 811.80] it matters to Peter,
[811.98 → 814.30] and it matters to God himself.
[815.48 → 817.22] But in this passage today,
[817.46 → 818.54] Paul teaches us
[818.54 → 823.52] that being single matters too.
[826.52 → 828.82] Some view this passage in 1 Corinthians
[828.82 → 830.14] as a calling for us,
[830.32 → 832.84] for us all to strive toward celibacy.
[832.84 → 834.08] However, as mentioned above,
[834.18 → 835.98] if we look at marriage through the lens of Scripture,
[836.20 → 837.58] that cannot be the case.
[838.48 → 839.86] However, the flip is also true.
[839.96 → 840.68] Some look at this
[840.68 → 843.16] and are guilty of simply brushing Paul's message off here
[843.16 → 844.38] as simply contextual,
[844.58 → 845.88] only for the people of Corinth
[845.88 → 848.10] because they have this crisis they have to get through.
[849.62 → 851.80] Both of those interpretations fall short.
[852.80 → 855.08] If we read 1 Corinthians 7 here
[855.08 → 858.48] in conjunction with what Jesus teaches in Matthew 19,
[858.48 → 861.04] we see that both Paul and Jesus
[861.04 → 862.68] get at the same thing.
[863.98 → 866.28] In Matthew 19, verses 10 to 12,
[866.72 → 868.88] which again, feel free to open your Bibles and turn to,
[869.38 → 870.90] Jesus is telling his disciples
[870.90 → 874.32] that not all are called to get married
[874.32 → 877.60] and that some specifically are called
[877.60 → 879.44] to remain single.
[879.44 → 883.66] Paul echoes that in this passage.
[883.78 → 884.54] He is teaching us
[884.54 → 886.58] that we all need to be
[886.58 → 890.36] undivided devoted to God.
[893.04 → 894.76] Back to this Corinthians passage.
[895.16 → 896.62] Four times in this text,
[897.04 → 899.80] Paul uses the Greek term Mérignac,
[900.04 → 903.38] which I had YouTube teach me how to say properly
[903.38 → 905.58] so that I wouldn't look foolish in front of all of you.
[905.58 → 910.14] Now this word Mérignac means to be anxious
[910.14 → 913.62] about either frivolous or genuine concerns.
[914.52 → 917.66] And in this letter, Paul uses this word Mérignac
[917.66 → 920.30] to refer to the normal affairs
[920.30 → 923.26] that married people face because of their marriage,
[923.48 → 925.76] which can compete with the time and energy
[925.76 → 927.34] that one has for the Lord.
[929.02 → 931.02] Paul never says that marriage is wrong,
[931.82 → 933.94] only that marriage brings with it
[933.94 → 935.98] frivolous and genuine concerns
[935.98 → 938.94] that might impede on our ability
[938.94 → 940.92] to be devoted to God.
[944.82 → 947.48] Singleness can also impede
[947.48 → 949.16] on one's ability to focus
[949.16 → 951.30] their relationship with God.
[952.08 → 953.86] If someone who is single
[953.86 → 956.36] spends the majority of his or her time
[956.36 → 958.02] trying to find that special someone,
[958.42 → 959.86] then their relationship with God
[959.86 → 961.18] would be just as impeded
[961.18 → 962.62] as the married person
[962.62 → 964.06] who spends too much of their time
[964.06 → 965.90] on the frivolous concerns
[965.90 → 967.16] of their marriage.
[970.18 → 973.24] The challenge for all of us
[973.24 → 974.08] here today
[974.08 → 975.72] is to ask ourselves,
[976.44 → 977.66] what is impeding
[977.66 → 978.70] my ability
[978.70 → 981.64] to be fully devoted
[981.64 → 982.72] to God?
[982.72 → 985.38] That is the heart
[985.38 → 986.40] of Paul's message
[986.40 → 987.30] here in this text.
[989.00 → 990.28] What is impeding
[990.28 → 991.76] my ability
[991.76 → 993.50] to be fully devoted
[993.50 → 994.38] to God?
[998.60 → 1000.30] All aspects of our lives,
[1000.50 → 1001.18] our jobs,
[1001.42 → 1002.14] our passions,
[1002.58 → 1004.08] our relational statuses,
[1004.24 → 1005.60] they are gifts from God.
[1005.66 → 1006.74] And we cannot assume
[1006.74 → 1008.86] that he has bigger marital plans
[1008.86 → 1009.76] for us if we're single,
[1009.76 → 1010.84] or that we've made
[1010.84 → 1011.82] a grievous error,
[1012.24 → 1013.10] or we are lesser
[1013.10 → 1013.92] in God's eyes
[1013.92 → 1014.64] if we are married.
[1015.56 → 1017.06] Our marital status
[1017.06 → 1018.98] should have no bearing
[1018.98 → 1020.96] on our devotion to Christ.
[1022.48 → 1023.82] Whatever our circumstance,
[1024.54 → 1026.40] we need to be an active believer
[1026.40 → 1027.74] in Christ our Saviour.
[1028.18 → 1029.62] Paul is challenging all of us,
[1029.68 → 1031.12] no matter our relationship status,
[1031.12 → 1033.62] to be undivided devoted
[1033.62 → 1034.62] to God.
[1036.24 → 1037.62] And so in that mindset,
[1037.62 → 1041.20] singleness needs to be seen
[1041.20 → 1043.22] by everybody in the church
[1043.22 → 1046.34] as being a gift from God.
[1047.02 → 1048.16] Because being single
[1048.16 → 1049.02] allows for people
[1049.02 → 1050.94] to have the unique way
[1050.94 → 1052.26] to show their devotion
[1052.26 → 1052.76] to the Lord,
[1052.82 → 1053.80] and it opens up the door
[1053.80 → 1056.46] to tremendous ministry opportunities.
[1060.56 → 1062.08] In order for this truth
[1062.08 → 1063.96] to fully take hold
[1063.96 → 1064.78] in the church,
[1065.06 → 1066.28] and I mean this church,
[1066.28 → 1067.60] but I mean the church,
[1068.66 → 1070.18] there are a couple of obstacles
[1070.18 → 1071.34] for the single Christian
[1071.34 → 1073.26] that we as a church body,
[1073.34 → 1074.08] all of us,
[1074.50 → 1075.74] need to overcome together.
[1077.62 → 1078.90] The first obstacle
[1078.90 → 1080.42] for the single Christian today
[1080.42 → 1081.62] is that the church
[1081.62 → 1083.04] puts undue pressure
[1083.04 → 1084.30] on them to get married.
[1086.10 → 1087.34] As mentioned earlier,
[1087.78 → 1088.94] rather than being seen
[1088.94 → 1090.58] as a gift from God,
[1090.70 → 1091.48] singleness is viewed
[1091.48 → 1092.10] within the church
[1092.10 → 1093.20] not only as second best
[1093.20 → 1093.64] to marriage,
[1093.64 → 1094.78] but it's often seen
[1094.78 → 1095.68] as a guarantee
[1095.68 → 1098.26] to an unfulfilled life,
[1098.40 → 1099.06] like you're just
[1099.06 → 1100.50] not quite there.
[1102.16 → 1103.18] That's hogwash,
[1103.40 → 1103.68] church,
[1103.82 → 1104.34] hogwash,
[1104.48 → 1104.80] I've been waiting
[1104.80 → 1105.42] to say that word.
[1106.06 → 1106.70] It's hogwash.
[1107.74 → 1108.92] The church has to change
[1108.92 → 1109.44] that narrative.
[1109.80 → 1110.46] We have to.
[1111.04 → 1111.74] Or the single people
[1111.74 → 1113.64] will always look at their lives
[1113.64 → 1114.54] as missing something
[1114.54 → 1115.06] from God.
[1116.38 → 1117.42] The reality is
[1117.42 → 1118.02] God has put them
[1118.02 → 1119.06] in a place to serve him
[1119.06 → 1119.76] and his kingdom
[1119.76 → 1120.48] in a multitude
[1120.48 → 1121.32] of unique ways,
[1121.32 → 1122.74] and we need to celebrate
[1122.74 → 1124.10] that as a church.
[1126.90 → 1128.08] A second obstacle
[1128.08 → 1129.62] is the feeling
[1129.62 → 1130.34] of loneliness
[1130.34 → 1131.86] that can come
[1131.86 → 1133.40] to one who is single.
[1134.28 → 1134.68] And again,
[1134.74 → 1135.24] this is something
[1135.24 → 1135.70] that the church,
[1135.80 → 1136.58] we just have to do
[1136.58 → 1137.32] a better job
[1137.32 → 1138.20] of combating.
[1140.38 → 1141.56] Jesus himself,
[1141.70 → 1142.38] in Mark 3,
[1142.46 → 1143.84] verses 31 to 35,
[1144.34 → 1144.94] he's asked,
[1145.10 → 1145.76] who is your family?
[1146.48 → 1147.22] And he answers
[1147.22 → 1147.70] and he points
[1147.70 → 1148.38] to his disciples
[1148.38 → 1148.94] and he says,
[1149.26 → 1150.22] here is my mother
[1150.22 → 1151.16] and my brother
[1151.16 → 1152.22] and my sisters.
[1152.44 → 1153.26] Here is my family.
[1153.34 → 1154.04] His point is not
[1154.04 → 1154.60] to belittle
[1154.60 → 1156.32] his real family,
[1156.70 → 1157.84] his biological family,
[1158.50 → 1160.68] but it's to raise up
[1160.68 → 1161.72] a new family,
[1161.82 → 1162.56] the church who would
[1162.56 → 1163.94] care for and look
[1163.94 → 1165.14] after one another
[1165.14 → 1166.64] beyond the bonds
[1166.64 → 1168.12] of biology.
[1170.06 → 1171.18] For a single person
[1171.18 → 1171.68] in the church,
[1171.80 → 1172.80] this family of faith
[1172.80 → 1174.06] needs to become part
[1174.06 → 1176.10] of their nuclear family.
[1176.26 → 1177.20] They shouldn't need
[1177.20 → 1178.30] a husband or a wife
[1178.30 → 1179.92] to fulfill that communal role
[1179.92 → 1180.54] in their lives.
[1180.86 → 1182.56] The body should be
[1182.56 → 1184.40] that community for them.
[1186.24 → 1187.74] If the church functioned
[1187.74 → 1188.56] as Christ calls it
[1188.56 → 1189.16] to function,
[1190.10 → 1191.36] loneliness should not affect
[1191.36 → 1192.76] the single Christian
[1192.76 → 1193.66] for long
[1193.66 → 1195.40] because they would be
[1195.40 → 1196.64] enveloped
[1196.64 → 1199.42] into the family of Christ.
[1202.82 → 1204.38] Singleness is just as big
[1204.38 → 1205.54] a benefit to one's life
[1205.54 → 1206.76] and to Christ's body
[1206.76 → 1207.38] as marriage.
[1207.38 → 1208.44] Right now,
[1208.52 → 1208.90] though the church
[1208.90 → 1209.92] generally views marriage
[1209.92 → 1211.08] in a more positive light,
[1211.28 → 1212.86] it would behoove all of us
[1212.86 → 1213.72] to swing that pendulum
[1213.72 → 1214.44] back to the middle.
[1216.06 → 1216.82] After all,
[1216.88 → 1217.86] both Paul and Jesus
[1217.86 → 1218.94] say that it is special
[1218.94 → 1220.16] and it is beneficial
[1220.16 → 1221.36] to be single
[1221.36 → 1222.44] in this life.
[1223.80 → 1225.16] There's a beautiful quote
[1225.16 → 1226.70] from Evan Lana
[1226.70 → 1228.38] and he sums up this nicely.
[1229.08 → 1229.50] He says,
[1229.50 → 1231.82] both Jesus and Paul
[1231.82 → 1233.34] retained a positive outlook
[1233.34 → 1234.00] on singleness
[1234.00 → 1236.00] because they recognized
[1236.00 → 1237.44] that the responsibilities
[1237.44 → 1238.36] of marriage
[1238.36 → 1239.44] could take away
[1239.44 → 1240.84] from a singular focus
[1240.84 → 1242.14] on ministry.
[1243.26 → 1244.12] In addition,
[1244.28 → 1245.24] being part of the body
[1245.24 → 1245.74] of Christ
[1245.74 → 1246.54] would provide
[1246.54 → 1247.58] a new family
[1247.58 → 1248.78] for believers
[1248.78 → 1249.76] whose bonds
[1249.76 → 1250.88] are stronger
[1250.88 → 1252.68] than an earthly family.
[1252.68 → 1252.76] family.
[1255.20 → 1255.96] And so,
[1256.34 → 1257.54] let's land here.
[1258.46 → 1259.24] If you're married,
[1260.08 → 1261.04] don't think that marriage
[1261.04 → 1261.90] is God's calling
[1261.90 → 1262.56] for everyone.
[1263.82 → 1264.82] Treat those who are single
[1264.82 → 1265.60] in your life
[1265.60 → 1267.34] like they are family.
[1268.60 → 1269.26] Celebrate them.
[1269.38 → 1270.00] Encourage them
[1270.00 → 1270.50] in their walk
[1270.50 → 1271.00] with their Lord.
[1272.60 → 1273.04] Push them
[1273.04 → 1274.08] to be devoted
[1274.08 → 1274.70] to God
[1274.70 → 1275.44] only.
[1276.24 → 1276.84] And as Paul
[1276.84 → 1277.82] encourages us all,
[1277.82 → 1279.66] don't let marriage,
[1279.78 → 1280.52] your marriage,
[1281.14 → 1281.82] distract you
[1281.82 → 1282.74] from your relationship
[1282.74 → 1283.50] with God.
[1284.84 → 1286.26] Don't let that impede.
[1287.76 → 1288.06] Rather,
[1288.20 → 1289.04] let your relationship
[1289.04 → 1290.02] with God
[1290.02 → 1291.44] enhance
[1291.44 → 1292.62] your relationship.
[1293.40 → 1294.76] Not just with your spouse,
[1294.88 → 1295.76] but with all people.
[1297.06 → 1297.90] And if you're single,
[1299.28 → 1300.54] don't get sucked
[1300.54 → 1301.86] into the false narrative
[1301.86 → 1302.80] that you need
[1302.80 → 1303.52] to get married
[1303.52 → 1304.72] to have a fulfilling
[1304.72 → 1306.58] and meaningful life.
[1307.82 → 1309.22] Be fully devoted
[1309.22 → 1309.88] to God.
[1311.00 → 1312.32] And infuse yourself
[1312.32 → 1313.32] into the lives
[1313.32 → 1314.16] of the people
[1314.16 → 1315.24] in your church.
[1316.14 → 1317.32] Don't let the distraction
[1317.32 → 1318.62] of your relational status
[1318.62 → 1319.88] affect your devotion
[1319.88 → 1320.72] to God.
[1320.94 → 1322.22] We sing all the time,
[1322.64 → 1323.70] He alone is worthy.
[1323.92 → 1325.08] He is above all.
[1325.36 → 1326.28] There is none other
[1326.28 → 1326.86] but Him.
[1328.66 → 1329.58] Believe that.
[1330.50 → 1331.20] Trust that.
[1331.28 → 1331.92] It is true.
[1334.36 → 1335.06] And for all of us,
[1335.12 → 1335.54] no matter what
[1335.54 → 1336.60] our marital status is,
[1336.60 → 1338.04] may we all be ready
[1338.04 → 1338.62] to say,
[1339.12 → 1339.92] here I am, Lord.
[1340.16 → 1340.94] Use me.
[1341.42 → 1342.14] Send me.
[1343.22 → 1344.78] Because it is for His glory
[1344.78 → 1345.78] and no one else's.
[1347.04 → 1348.10] Let us all
[1348.10 → 1350.10] be fully devoted
[1350.10 → 1351.36] to God.
[1352.24 → 1353.02] Let me pray.
[1353.02 → 1364.80] God, today,
[1364.80 → 1365.56] God, when you boil
[1365.56 → 1366.30] them down to it,
[1366.34 → 1367.28] they always say,
[1368.48 → 1369.06] You are Lord.
[1369.86 → 1370.74] Follow You.
[1374.02 → 1374.88] God, today,
[1375.06 → 1376.04] no matter who we are,
[1376.64 → 1377.42] no matter our
[1377.42 → 1378.44] relational status,
[1378.60 → 1379.90] no matter our job status,
[1380.06 → 1381.64] no matter our economic status,
[1381.64 → 1383.02] no matter what status
[1383.02 → 1384.62] we have been labelled with
[1384.62 → 1385.86] or that we have chosen,
[1387.56 → 1388.56] may none of that
[1388.56 → 1389.28] impede
[1389.28 → 1391.00] with our ability
[1391.00 → 1392.26] to be fully
[1392.26 → 1393.04] devoted
[1393.04 → 1394.06] to You.
[1395.08 → 1396.04] May we rise up
[1396.04 → 1396.62] as a church,
[1396.80 → 1396.90] Lord.
[1396.96 → 1397.70] May we be there
[1397.70 → 1398.30] for each other.
[1398.38 → 1399.52] May we be a family,
[1399.74 → 1400.92] no matter who we are,
[1400.98 → 1401.60] to each other,
[1401.74 → 1402.58] so that no one
[1402.58 → 1403.22] feels lost,
[1403.50 → 1404.62] no one feels left out,
[1404.82 → 1405.94] no one feels alone,
[1406.14 → 1406.98] and may we,
[1407.20 → 1408.02] as a community,
[1408.08 → 1409.52] strive to seek You
[1409.52 → 1410.66] first above all else.
[1411.12 → 1411.84] May that be
[1411.84 → 1412.56] what we leave here
[1412.56 → 1413.16] today with,
[1413.74 → 1414.86] a desire with,
[1414.96 → 1415.52] no matter what is
[1415.52 → 1416.16] happening in the world
[1416.16 → 1416.74] around us,
[1416.86 → 1417.98] to seek You first
[1417.98 → 1419.22] and to love each other.
[1420.76 → 1421.20] And so, God,
[1421.24 → 1424.24] as we respond in song today,
[1424.30 → 1425.16] may that be imprinted
[1425.16 → 1425.88] on our hearts.
[1426.02 → 1426.74] We pray this all
[1426.74 → 1427.28] in Your Son's
[1427.28 → 1428.36] precious and holy name.
[1428.98 → 1429.20] Amen.
[1429.20 → 1429.32] Amen.
[1429.32 → 1429.36] Amen.
[1429.36 → 1429.38] Amen.
