[0.00 --> 12.32]  so we're going to spend the next little while in the gospel of john we're going to look at
[12.32 --> 19.16]  john 4 i'm going to read from verse 43 to the end of that chapter verse 54
[19.16 --> 26.08]  if you have a bible with you i encourage you to open that up if or turn it on if it's your phone
[26.08 --> 33.18]  whatever the case just find yourself in john 4 and we're going to start at verse 43
[33.18 --> 38.54]  before we read together i'd love if we could pray one more time let's pray
[38.54 --> 49.14]  lord jesus as we have sung we do come now to hear you speak and so speak oh lord
[49.14 --> 54.06]  renew our minds teach us and transform us
[54.06 --> 62.86]  open your word to our hearts and souls that it might be for us the word of life
[62.86 --> 68.62]  that these would be more than words on a page more than words on a screen that these would be
[68.62 --> 72.12]  to us the very voice of jesus
[72.12 --> 80.84]  and we might know them and live pray in your name lord jesus amen
[80.84 --> 87.10]  in john 4 we'll start at verse 43
[87.10 --> 94.86]  after the two days he that's jesus left for galilee
[94.86 --> 100.42]  now jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honor in his own country
[100.42 --> 104.84]  when he arrived in galilee the galileans welcomed him
[104.84 --> 111.14]  they'd seen all that he had done in jerusalem at the passover feast for they also had been there
[111.14 --> 117.76]  once more he visited cana in galilee where he had turned the water into wine
[117.76 --> 123.72]  and there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at capernaum
[123.72 --> 128.36]  and when this man heard that jesus had arrived in galilee from judea
[128.36 --> 134.38]  he went to him and he begged him to come and heal his son who was close to death
[134.38 --> 142.20]  unless you people see miraculous signs and wonders jesus told them
[142.20 --> 144.52]  you will never believe
[144.52 --> 151.44]  the royal official said sir come down before my child dies
[151.44 --> 159.46]  jesus replied you may go your son will live
[159.46 --> 163.30]  and the man took jesus at his word and departed
[163.30 --> 168.58]  and while he was still on his way his servants met him with the news that the boy was living
[168.58 --> 173.04]  and when he inquired as to the time when his son got better they said to him
[173.04 --> 176.60]  the fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour
[176.60 --> 183.88]  then the father realized that this was the exact time at which jesus had said to him
[183.88 --> 185.78]  your son will live
[185.78 --> 190.20]  and so he and all his household believed
[190.20 --> 194.62]  this was the second miraculous sign that jesus performed
[194.62 --> 197.56]  having come from judea to galilee
[197.56 --> 199.26]  this is the word of the lord
[199.26 --> 205.40]  so i don't have to tell you
[205.40 --> 207.24]  that this is weird
[207.24 --> 210.48]  right this whole time this whole season
[210.48 --> 213.66]  is strange and different and abnormal
[213.66 --> 214.62]  and
[214.62 --> 217.34]  you probably don't like it
[217.34 --> 219.56]  now let's be real right of course
[219.56 --> 221.44]  we found ways to make it work
[221.44 --> 223.04]  we found simple joys right
[223.04 --> 225.58]  we found opportunities to find connection
[225.58 --> 227.56]  and express ourselves and to have that
[227.56 --> 231.46]  kind of feeling remain in our lives
[231.46 --> 233.00]  but it's just been weird
[233.00 --> 238.24]  do you remember way back when this started
[238.24 --> 242.94]  and you guys are probably better on the west coast than we were back in ontario
[242.94 --> 243.92]  i'll give you that one
[243.92 --> 245.56]  but do you remember way back when this started
[245.56 --> 247.78]  there was a shortage on toilet paper
[247.78 --> 250.34]  toilet paper
[250.34 --> 253.68]  right people were stockpiling in case of emergency
[253.68 --> 256.30]  and for some reason it was toilet paper
[256.30 --> 258.48]  that made international headlines
[258.48 --> 263.24]  but then
[263.24 --> 264.92]  things got really serious
[264.92 --> 267.42]  schools closed
[267.42 --> 270.68]  life shut down for many of us
[270.68 --> 272.40]  and how many
[272.40 --> 274.04]  how many parents here became
[274.04 --> 276.54]  unvolunteered homeschool teachers
[276.54 --> 279.90]  how many of you loved that
[279.90 --> 282.94]  hands quickly went down right
[282.94 --> 285.92]  how many of you
[285.92 --> 286.98]  now believe
[286.98 --> 288.18]  as a result of all this
[288.18 --> 288.46]  that
[288.46 --> 290.40]  your kids teachers deserve a medal
[290.40 --> 291.82]  i do
[291.82 --> 294.46]  i would say a pay raise
[294.46 --> 295.76]  but i know the communities we're in
[295.76 --> 298.08]  right
[298.08 --> 299.44]  isolation orders
[299.44 --> 300.70]  social distancing
[300.70 --> 302.20]  everything has been cancelled
[302.20 --> 303.62]  there's travel bans
[303.62 --> 304.32]  right
[304.32 --> 304.84]  for a while
[304.84 --> 305.54]  we were unsure
[305.54 --> 307.06]  if we were even going to be able to come out here
[307.06 --> 309.26]  and how we were going to make that happen
[309.26 --> 311.24]  now
[311.24 --> 312.46]  again
[312.46 --> 314.22]  i know that
[314.22 --> 316.20]  you guys have been pretty good in this
[316.20 --> 317.72]  and that your church has been kept safe
[317.72 --> 319.00]  in all of this
[319.00 --> 319.40]  and i know
[319.40 --> 320.60]  that for some of us
[320.60 --> 321.80]  life has changed very
[321.80 --> 322.60]  little
[322.60 --> 323.48]  right
[323.48 --> 323.92]  and again
[323.92 --> 325.14]  things out here in the west
[325.14 --> 326.84]  are better than they are back in ontario
[326.84 --> 328.34]  we're catching up slowly
[328.34 --> 329.24]  sure
[329.24 --> 330.62]  and i'm
[330.62 --> 331.68]  sure that
[331.68 --> 333.86]  y'all are not the type of people
[333.86 --> 334.72]  who are running out
[334.72 --> 336.16]  clearing grocery store shelves
[336.16 --> 336.96]  of toilet paper
[336.96 --> 338.52]  right
[338.52 --> 340.62]  i doubt that if i came to your house later
[340.62 --> 341.98]  and opened a closet
[341.98 --> 343.80]  i would have an avalanche of tp
[343.80 --> 344.72]  falling all over me
[344.72 --> 346.66]  that's probably not the kind of people
[346.66 --> 347.60]  you are
[347.60 --> 348.54]  and yet
[348.54 --> 351.14]  i'm sure you've noticed
[351.14 --> 351.94]  that there's
[351.94 --> 353.06]  an anxiety
[353.06 --> 354.54]  in the system
[354.54 --> 356.08]  right
[356.08 --> 356.52]  there's a
[356.52 --> 358.22]  a general experience
[358.22 --> 359.14]  of fear
[359.14 --> 360.16]  and worry
[360.16 --> 361.20]  and concern
[361.20 --> 363.04]  that to the best of our abilities
[363.04 --> 363.64]  we just
[363.64 --> 364.84]  can't control
[364.84 --> 366.98]  we just can't
[366.98 --> 367.72]  figure it out
[367.72 --> 369.82]  and let's be real
[369.82 --> 370.04]  right
[370.04 --> 370.72]  covid19
[370.72 --> 372.74]  is just the most recent example
[372.74 --> 373.22]  of that
[373.22 --> 374.64]  because there's always fear
[374.64 --> 375.92]  there's always anxiety
[375.92 --> 377.04]  there's always worry
[377.04 --> 378.50]  in the systems of life
[378.50 --> 380.94]  but that's where i want to start
[380.94 --> 382.58]  this morning
[382.58 --> 385.26]  with our feelings of fear
[385.26 --> 387.18]  and anxiety
[387.18 --> 388.28]  particularly
[388.28 --> 389.84]  with the feeling of fear
[389.84 --> 390.44]  and anxiety
[390.44 --> 391.04]  that comes
[391.04 --> 392.26]  when we feel
[392.26 --> 393.42]  out of control
[393.42 --> 396.28]  now
[396.28 --> 398.32]  before i do that
[398.32 --> 399.68]  here's what i know
[399.68 --> 400.70]  first let me say that
[400.70 --> 402.22]  i'm talking here about
[402.22 --> 403.24]  general anxiety
[403.24 --> 403.96]  in the system
[403.96 --> 404.92]  right
[404.92 --> 405.86]  i'm not talking about
[405.86 --> 406.84]  clinical anxiety
[406.84 --> 408.04]  or clinical depression
[408.04 --> 409.92]  that's a different conversation
[409.92 --> 411.02]  i would love to sit down
[411.02 --> 412.36]  if that's your reality
[412.36 --> 413.14]  and meet you
[413.14 --> 413.92]  and talk about that
[413.92 --> 414.94]  but here i'm just talking about
[414.94 --> 416.40]  general anxiety
[416.40 --> 418.64]  and i know that
[418.64 --> 419.82]  everyone's experience
[419.82 --> 420.98]  of fear and anxiety
[420.98 --> 421.74]  is different
[421.74 --> 422.28]  and unique
[422.28 --> 423.80]  right
[423.80 --> 424.76]  so for the next
[424.76 --> 425.82]  couple minutes anyway
[425.82 --> 427.06]  i'm going to talk about
[427.06 --> 427.94]  my own experience
[427.94 --> 428.18]  of that
[428.18 --> 428.72]  i'm going to talk about
[428.72 --> 429.24]  myself
[429.24 --> 430.40]  my own struggles
[430.40 --> 431.52]  and fear and anxiety
[431.52 --> 432.24]  and control
[432.24 --> 433.58]  and i want to do that
[433.58 --> 433.98]  because
[433.98 --> 436.12]  i can't do
[436.12 --> 437.36]  the work of application
[437.36 --> 437.90]  for you
[437.90 --> 439.48]  right
[439.48 --> 440.26]  and so when i think
[440.26 --> 441.36]  say things like
[441.36 --> 442.28]  i struggle with
[442.28 --> 443.40]  or i believe
[443.40 --> 443.72]  or
[443.72 --> 445.22]  this is my
[445.22 --> 446.12]  experience
[446.12 --> 447.56]  you sitting here
[447.56 --> 447.86]  right
[447.86 --> 448.66]  doing your own work
[448.66 --> 449.24]  of application
[449.24 --> 450.78]  should ask the question
[450.78 --> 452.60]  how is this true for me
[452.60 --> 453.72]  right
[453.72 --> 454.42]  how do i believe
[454.42 --> 455.62]  the same or similar
[455.62 --> 456.28]  things
[456.28 --> 457.24]  how do i struggle
[457.24 --> 457.50]  with this
[457.50 --> 458.72]  what is my heart saying
[458.72 --> 459.68]  when i believe
[459.68 --> 460.38]  this
[460.38 --> 462.54]  and i know that
[462.54 --> 463.20]  i'm not alone
[463.20 --> 464.08]  in these struggles
[464.08 --> 465.90]  right
[465.90 --> 466.42]  your struggles
[466.42 --> 467.54]  are unique to you
[467.54 --> 467.94]  yes
[467.94 --> 468.92]  but there are themes
[468.92 --> 469.86]  and there are underlying
[469.86 --> 470.44]  beliefs
[470.44 --> 472.14]  in the systems
[472.14 --> 473.14]  and the lives
[473.14 --> 474.16]  that we share together
[474.16 --> 475.34]  right
[475.34 --> 475.80]  the work
[475.80 --> 476.94]  of applying this
[476.94 --> 478.00]  is your own
[478.00 --> 478.98]  but the journey
[478.98 --> 479.76]  of doing so
[479.76 --> 480.68]  is ours together
[480.68 --> 481.48]  okay
[481.48 --> 483.10]  can we do that together
[483.10 --> 485.20]  so i'm going to open
[485.20 --> 485.66]  the door
[485.66 --> 486.30]  for the spirit
[486.30 --> 486.78]  to work
[486.78 --> 488.14]  but you got to walk
[488.14 --> 488.78]  through it
[488.78 --> 489.54]  cool
[489.54 --> 491.86]  i really appreciate
[491.86 --> 493.20]  at least facial feedback
[493.20 --> 493.70]  cool
[493.70 --> 494.20]  all right
[494.20 --> 494.50]  good
[494.50 --> 495.06]  thank you
[495.06 --> 497.64]  so at times like these
[497.64 --> 499.24]  it's easy to feel
[499.24 --> 500.78]  out of control
[500.78 --> 502.28]  right
[502.28 --> 502.80]  it feels like
[502.80 --> 503.88]  everything around me
[503.88 --> 504.88]  is determining
[504.88 --> 505.94]  reality
[505.94 --> 507.04]  for me
[507.04 --> 507.64]  that i have
[507.64 --> 508.62]  no agency
[508.62 --> 509.74]  in what's going
[509.74 --> 510.10]  on
[510.10 --> 512.24]  and somewhere
[512.24 --> 513.08]  in my heart
[513.08 --> 514.00]  i believe
[514.00 --> 515.30]  that i should
[515.30 --> 517.50]  that i should
[517.50 --> 518.44]  have some control
[518.44 --> 519.52]  over my reality
[519.52 --> 520.16]  that i should
[520.16 --> 520.96]  have some power
[520.96 --> 521.96]  and agency
[521.96 --> 523.22]  to affect change
[523.22 --> 524.92]  right
[524.92 --> 525.80]  and think about that
[525.80 --> 526.66]  as we say that
[526.66 --> 527.40]  because this is important
[527.40 --> 528.16]  this is the foundation
[528.16 --> 528.60]  right
[528.60 --> 530.16]  if we didn't believe
[530.16 --> 531.20]  that we should
[531.20 --> 531.84]  have control
[531.84 --> 533.22]  there would be
[533.22 --> 533.92]  no anxiety
[533.92 --> 534.86]  when we don't
[534.86 --> 535.50]  have control
[535.50 --> 537.86]  okay
[537.86 --> 539.02]  but since we believe
[539.02 --> 539.82]  that we should have
[539.82 --> 540.80]  control of our lives
[540.80 --> 541.54]  and of our destiny
[541.54 --> 543.04]  when things like this
[543.04 --> 543.44]  happen
[543.44 --> 545.68]  it challenges
[545.68 --> 546.50]  that belief
[546.50 --> 547.62]  right
[547.62 --> 548.26]  that assumption
[548.26 --> 549.72]  about my agency
[549.72 --> 550.34]  and my power
[550.34 --> 550.84]  in the world
[550.84 --> 552.78]  and we don't like it
[552.78 --> 553.74]  or at least
[553.74 --> 554.72]  i don't
[554.72 --> 555.28]  like it
[555.28 --> 557.54]  but i want to take
[557.54 --> 558.40]  that even one level
[558.40 --> 558.80]  deeper
[558.80 --> 560.16]  if you'll go there
[560.16 --> 560.52]  with me
[560.52 --> 561.10]  this morning
[561.10 --> 564.02]  when i start to feel
[564.02 --> 564.62]  like i don't have
[564.62 --> 565.06]  power
[565.06 --> 565.96]  or when i don't
[565.96 --> 566.70]  have control
[566.70 --> 569.44]  i begin to wonder
[569.44 --> 571.42]  does anyone
[571.42 --> 574.06]  does god
[574.06 --> 576.34]  right maybe
[576.34 --> 577.28]  in those moments
[577.28 --> 578.14]  we really feel
[578.14 --> 579.10]  like god
[579.10 --> 580.26]  has lost control
[580.26 --> 581.50]  like he's left us
[581.50 --> 582.26]  in this mess
[582.26 --> 583.34]  like he's forgotten
[583.34 --> 583.94]  about us
[583.94 --> 584.90]  maybe it feels
[584.90 --> 585.34]  like god
[585.34 --> 586.32]  has abandoned us
[586.32 --> 587.96]  and before you think
[587.96 --> 588.42]  i'm a heretic
[588.42 --> 589.04]  for saying that
[589.04 --> 589.82]  read the book
[589.82 --> 590.40]  of psalms
[590.40 --> 592.00]  and you will know
[592.00 --> 592.68]  that this is an
[592.68 --> 593.64]  ordinary christian
[593.64 --> 594.16]  question
[594.16 --> 595.78]  an ordinary
[595.78 --> 596.74]  encounter with god
[596.74 --> 598.68]  now i get
[598.68 --> 599.52]  that most of us
[599.52 --> 600.60]  would never admit
[600.60 --> 601.36]  that out loud
[601.36 --> 604.54]  but that's the
[604.54 --> 605.20]  straight line
[605.20 --> 606.90]  from feeling
[606.90 --> 607.94]  fear and anxiety
[607.94 --> 609.06]  because we've
[609.06 --> 610.26]  lost control
[610.26 --> 611.18]  but believe
[611.18 --> 611.80]  we should be
[611.80 --> 613.78]  right
[613.78 --> 614.32]  the straight line
[614.32 --> 615.20]  ends that no one
[615.20 --> 615.90]  is in control
[615.90 --> 616.92]  right
[616.92 --> 617.54]  in the depths
[617.54 --> 618.70]  of our hearts
[618.70 --> 619.72]  and minds
[619.72 --> 621.46]  pervasively
[621.46 --> 622.14]  so
[622.14 --> 623.28]  there's no
[623.28 --> 624.14]  other alternatives
[624.14 --> 625.98]  there's no doubt
[625.98 --> 627.34]  if we didn't have
[627.34 --> 628.04]  this there would be
[628.04 --> 628.82]  no room for fear
[628.82 --> 629.66]  or anxiety
[629.66 --> 630.08]  so what we're
[630.08 --> 630.70]  talking about
[630.70 --> 631.52]  here really
[631.52 --> 632.16]  in the depths
[632.16 --> 632.44]  of it
[632.44 --> 633.48]  is a belief
[633.48 --> 634.20]  issue
[634.20 --> 636.36]  a heart issue
[636.36 --> 637.64]  right this is
[637.64 --> 638.12]  about what
[638.12 --> 639.36]  i really believe
[639.36 --> 639.94]  and what
[639.94 --> 641.10]  i live out of
[641.10 --> 641.90]  as a result
[641.90 --> 644.32]  and so again
[644.32 --> 646.08]  let's go down
[646.08 --> 647.24]  one more level
[647.24 --> 648.32]  deeper
[648.32 --> 650.72]  when we feel
[650.72 --> 651.30]  that way
[651.30 --> 653.66]  what does it
[653.66 --> 654.02]  mean
[654.02 --> 655.00]  for who i
[655.00 --> 656.14]  believe god
[656.14 --> 656.96]  is
[656.96 --> 658.70]  right with
[658.70 --> 659.28]  everything that's
[659.28 --> 659.92]  going on
[659.92 --> 660.48]  with everything
[660.48 --> 661.00]  that i feel
[661.00 --> 661.42]  with all that
[661.42 --> 662.26]  fear and anxiety
[662.26 --> 662.74]  that's in the
[662.74 --> 663.08]  system
[663.08 --> 663.56]  right
[663.56 --> 664.90]  it feels like
[664.90 --> 665.80]  god is distant
[665.80 --> 666.82]  it feels like
[666.82 --> 667.34]  he doesn't really
[667.34 --> 667.84]  care
[667.84 --> 668.72]  that he doesn't
[668.72 --> 669.22]  really have
[669.22 --> 669.64]  power
[669.64 --> 671.66]  and so you see
[671.66 --> 672.32]  what's happening
[672.32 --> 673.06]  right and again
[673.06 --> 673.52]  we would never
[673.52 --> 674.18]  say this out
[674.18 --> 674.46]  loud
[674.46 --> 676.84]  but that feeling
[676.84 --> 677.48]  of fear
[677.48 --> 678.52]  and anxiety
[678.52 --> 679.44]  that reacting
[679.44 --> 680.12]  in fear
[680.12 --> 680.62]  that we do
[680.62 --> 681.80]  allowing fear
[681.80 --> 682.88]  to determine
[682.88 --> 684.14]  my actions
[684.14 --> 684.68]  in the world
[684.68 --> 685.46]  and my belief
[685.46 --> 686.00]  in god
[686.00 --> 686.64]  or my belief
[686.64 --> 687.12]  in the god
[687.12 --> 687.60]  of the bible
[687.60 --> 688.74]  comes up to
[688.74 --> 689.50]  this place
[689.50 --> 690.54]  that that fear
[690.54 --> 691.56]  is the fruit
[691.56 --> 692.44]  of some other
[692.44 --> 692.94]  belief
[692.94 --> 694.24]  some other
[694.24 --> 694.78]  idea
[694.78 --> 696.80]  right some
[696.80 --> 697.94]  other concept
[697.94 --> 698.66]  of what i think
[698.66 --> 699.24]  is true
[699.24 --> 700.58]  worry
[700.58 --> 701.90]  is the fruit
[701.90 --> 702.54]  of a belief
[702.54 --> 703.04]  that god
[703.04 --> 703.82]  really isn't
[703.82 --> 704.44]  in control
[704.44 --> 705.60]  that god
[705.60 --> 706.14]  has abandoned
[706.14 --> 706.72]  me or
[706.72 --> 707.72]  or left me
[707.72 --> 708.44]  to my own
[708.44 --> 708.96]  devices
[708.96 --> 710.48]  and the kind
[710.48 --> 711.12]  of anxiety
[711.12 --> 712.34]  that rules us
[712.34 --> 712.98]  and weighs us
[712.98 --> 713.82]  down is really
[713.82 --> 714.38]  the fruit
[714.38 --> 715.20]  of an idea
[715.20 --> 716.52]  or a claim
[716.52 --> 717.06]  a belief
[717.06 --> 717.74]  assumption
[717.74 --> 718.68]  of god
[718.68 --> 719.50]  that says
[719.50 --> 720.30]  he ultimately
[720.30 --> 721.06]  doesn't have
[721.06 --> 721.56]  agency
[721.56 --> 722.64]  in the world
[722.64 --> 724.08]  and neither
[724.08 --> 724.44]  do we
[724.44 --> 727.78]  now again
[727.78 --> 728.68]  most of us
[728.68 --> 729.62]  don't really
[729.62 --> 730.78]  dig this deep
[730.78 --> 731.58]  into our
[731.58 --> 732.30]  experiences
[732.30 --> 733.02]  and emotions
[733.02 --> 733.54]  and our
[733.54 --> 733.92]  beliefs
[733.92 --> 734.88]  regularly
[734.88 --> 736.48]  right
[736.48 --> 736.84]  oftentimes
[736.84 --> 737.68]  we feel
[737.68 --> 738.30]  that anxiety
[738.30 --> 738.98]  or fear
[738.98 --> 739.58]  and we try
[739.58 --> 739.98]  to push it
[739.98 --> 740.30]  away
[740.30 --> 740.82]  we try
[740.82 --> 741.20]  to ignore
[741.20 --> 741.38]  it
[741.38 --> 741.64]  or we
[741.64 --> 742.12]  project it
[742.12 --> 742.46]  on someone
[742.46 --> 742.70]  else
[742.70 --> 742.98]  we make
[742.98 --> 743.24]  it someone
[743.24 --> 743.60]  else's
[743.60 --> 743.96]  problem
[743.96 --> 744.26]  and we
[744.26 --> 744.92]  blame them
[744.92 --> 746.12]  right
[746.12 --> 746.72]  we distance
[746.72 --> 747.14]  ourselves
[747.14 --> 747.64]  from it
[747.64 --> 748.88]  but really
[748.88 --> 749.54]  think about
[749.54 --> 749.90]  it
[749.90 --> 751.18]  right
[751.18 --> 751.98]  I believe
[751.98 --> 753.16]  that part
[753.16 --> 753.80]  of Christian
[753.80 --> 754.64]  discipleship
[754.64 --> 755.30]  part of
[755.30 --> 756.10]  my job
[756.10 --> 756.80]  as pastor
[756.80 --> 757.66]  is to ask
[757.66 --> 758.30]  those questions
[758.30 --> 758.74]  that nobody
[758.74 --> 759.56]  else will ask
[759.56 --> 760.24]  in your life
[760.24 --> 761.14]  and I think
[761.14 --> 761.56]  that part
[761.56 --> 761.86]  of that
[761.86 --> 762.80]  is wondering
[762.80 --> 763.46]  about
[763.46 --> 764.16]  and thinking
[764.16 --> 764.52]  about
[764.52 --> 765.00]  what does
[765.00 --> 765.36]  it mean
[765.36 --> 766.00]  to take
[766.00 --> 766.92]  every thought
[766.92 --> 767.34]  captive
[767.34 --> 768.00]  to Christ
[768.00 --> 769.06]  right
[769.06 --> 769.28]  that's
[769.28 --> 769.86]  2 Corinthians
[769.86 --> 770.24]  10
[770.24 --> 771.26]  we have
[771.26 --> 771.72]  to test
[771.72 --> 772.48]  every feeling
[772.48 --> 773.02]  together
[773.02 --> 773.86]  every fear
[773.86 --> 774.92]  every anxiety
[774.92 --> 775.66]  every worry
[775.66 --> 776.80]  we test
[776.80 --> 777.50]  these feelings
[777.50 --> 777.86]  against
[777.86 --> 778.98]  what we know
[778.98 --> 779.72]  to be true
[779.72 --> 780.86]  in the gospel
[780.86 --> 783.16]  because again
[783.16 --> 783.54]  right
[783.54 --> 784.10]  here's the
[784.10 --> 785.10]  parallel thing
[785.10 --> 785.90]  in all of this
[785.90 --> 787.08]  even when I
[787.08 --> 788.18]  feel fear
[788.18 --> 788.88]  and anxiety
[788.88 --> 789.58]  even when I
[789.58 --> 790.16]  can trace
[790.16 --> 790.94]  the fruit
[790.94 --> 791.76]  of that feeling
[791.76 --> 792.60]  to a belief
[792.60 --> 793.54]  that it's growing
[793.54 --> 794.02]  out of
[794.02 --> 794.82]  that it's rooted
[794.82 --> 795.02]  in
[795.02 --> 795.94]  even when I
[795.94 --> 796.74]  live like
[796.74 --> 797.42]  God isn't
[797.42 --> 798.26]  in control
[798.26 --> 798.82]  when it feels
[798.82 --> 799.20]  like he's
[799.20 --> 799.50]  distant
[799.50 --> 800.14]  or when he's
[800.14 --> 800.72]  abandoned me
[800.72 --> 801.32]  it feels
[801.32 --> 801.86]  like he doesn't
[801.86 --> 802.06]  care
[802.06 --> 803.00]  even when
[803.00 --> 803.66]  I think
[803.66 --> 804.20]  all of that
[804.20 --> 804.68]  is true
[804.68 --> 805.40]  in my head
[805.40 --> 806.52]  I know
[806.52 --> 807.60]  in my heart
[807.60 --> 808.26]  that there is
[808.26 --> 809.24]  a greater truth
[809.24 --> 809.96]  I know
[809.96 --> 810.62]  in my heart
[810.62 --> 811.08]  that there's
[811.08 --> 811.42]  a true
[811.42 --> 811.94]  and better
[811.94 --> 812.46]  story
[812.46 --> 813.12]  than the one
[813.12 --> 813.54]  that I am
[813.54 --> 814.34]  telling myself
[814.34 --> 814.72]  right now
[814.72 --> 815.14]  than the one
[815.14 --> 815.46]  that I'm
[815.46 --> 816.28]  living out
[816.28 --> 816.80]  of right now
[816.80 --> 817.50]  and so
[817.50 --> 818.12]  I need to
[818.12 --> 818.74]  confess
[818.74 --> 819.56]  the lie
[819.56 --> 820.00]  that I have
[820.00 --> 820.70]  been living
[820.70 --> 821.10]  out of
[821.10 --> 821.80]  and believing
[821.80 --> 822.76]  and feeling
[822.76 --> 823.06]  from
[823.06 --> 823.44]  and I need
[823.44 --> 824.02]  to remind
[824.02 --> 824.60]  myself
[824.60 --> 825.22]  of that
[825.22 --> 825.80]  story
[825.80 --> 828.58]  it's one
[828.58 --> 828.86]  of the reasons
[828.86 --> 829.38]  why worship
[829.38 --> 830.14]  is so important
[830.14 --> 831.58]  gathering in
[831.58 --> 832.06]  community
[832.06 --> 832.52]  together
[832.52 --> 833.76]  is so critical
[833.76 --> 835.46]  we've got to
[835.46 --> 836.44]  preach the gospel
[836.44 --> 837.96]  to our fears
[837.96 --> 838.88]  and our worries
[838.88 --> 839.96]  and anxieties
[839.96 --> 842.04]  so we've got to
[842.04 --> 842.56]  ask what does
[842.56 --> 843.38]  the bible say
[843.38 --> 844.08]  to my fear
[844.08 --> 844.98]  what does the bible
[844.98 --> 846.44]  say to my anxiety
[846.44 --> 847.94]  what does Jesus say
[847.94 --> 849.04]  how does the gospel
[849.04 --> 849.82]  give me something
[849.82 --> 850.24]  better
[850.24 --> 852.72]  with that in mind
[852.72 --> 853.58]  I want to pull
[853.58 --> 854.98]  on one string
[854.98 --> 856.32]  from the text
[856.32 --> 856.98]  that we read
[856.98 --> 858.42]  together
[858.42 --> 859.90]  just one
[859.90 --> 860.62]  string
[860.62 --> 861.46]  one theme
[861.46 --> 862.76]  out of that text
[862.76 --> 864.08]  if your bibles
[864.08 --> 864.80]  are still in front
[864.80 --> 865.10]  of you
[865.10 --> 865.76]  if you have
[865.76 --> 866.24]  that story
[866.24 --> 867.36]  verse 46
[867.36 --> 869.76]  we read
[869.76 --> 870.46]  once more
[870.46 --> 871.04]  he visited
[871.04 --> 871.50]  Cana
[871.50 --> 872.24]  in Galilee
[872.24 --> 872.86]  where he had
[872.86 --> 873.68]  turned the water
[873.68 --> 874.46]  into wine
[874.46 --> 874.98]  and there was
[874.98 --> 875.46]  a certain
[875.46 --> 876.32]  royal official
[876.32 --> 877.00]  whose son
[877.00 --> 877.80]  lay sick
[877.80 --> 879.16]  at Capernaum
[879.16 --> 880.68]  and when this
[880.68 --> 881.22]  man had heard
[881.22 --> 881.64]  that Jesus
[881.64 --> 882.18]  had arrived
[882.18 --> 882.64]  in Galilee
[882.64 --> 883.20]  from Judea
[883.20 --> 883.70]  he went
[883.70 --> 884.12]  to him
[884.12 --> 885.04]  and begged
[885.04 --> 885.72]  him to come
[885.72 --> 886.22]  and heal
[886.22 --> 886.82]  his son
[886.82 --> 887.22]  who was
[887.22 --> 887.72]  close
[887.72 --> 888.92]  to death
[888.92 --> 890.88]  so Jesus
[890.88 --> 891.82]  is in Samaria
[891.82 --> 893.22]  to the west
[893.22 --> 893.72]  of here
[893.72 --> 894.16]  where he
[894.16 --> 895.22]  was
[895.22 --> 897.22]  doing some work
[897.22 --> 897.78]  and some ministry
[897.78 --> 898.88]  remember he met
[898.88 --> 899.30]  the woman
[899.30 --> 899.86]  at the well
[899.86 --> 900.88]  he told her
[900.88 --> 901.96]  all about her life
[901.96 --> 902.28]  and her
[902.28 --> 903.88]  previous marriages
[903.88 --> 904.56]  and sin
[904.56 --> 905.40]  and she was
[905.40 --> 906.34]  convicted by
[906.34 --> 907.20]  this encounter
[907.20 --> 907.66]  with Jesus
[907.66 --> 908.56]  and a number
[908.56 --> 908.98]  of people
[908.98 --> 909.70]  came to believe
[909.70 --> 910.20]  as a result
[910.20 --> 910.50]  of that
[910.50 --> 911.76]  Jesus leaves
[911.76 --> 912.64]  that experience
[912.64 --> 913.22]  in Samaria
[913.22 --> 913.78]  and he comes
[913.78 --> 914.62]  back to Galilee
[914.62 --> 915.46]  this is his
[915.46 --> 916.22]  home region
[916.22 --> 917.08]  right
[917.08 --> 917.66]  this is
[917.66 --> 918.82]  northern Israel
[918.82 --> 919.48]  he goes back
[919.48 --> 920.02]  to Canaan
[920.02 --> 921.20]  where he did
[921.20 --> 921.90]  his first miracle
[921.90 --> 922.64]  you know the story
[922.64 --> 923.14]  right
[923.14 --> 923.68]  turned water
[923.68 --> 924.24]  into wine
[924.24 --> 924.90]  John 2
[924.90 --> 926.40]  while there
[926.40 --> 927.20]  in Cana
[927.20 --> 928.48]  a certain
[928.48 --> 929.30]  royal official
[929.30 --> 930.08]  comes to him
[930.08 --> 931.08]  it's probably
[931.08 --> 932.02]  a royal official
[932.02 --> 933.38]  of a gentleman
[933.38 --> 934.76]  named Herod Antipas
[934.76 --> 935.86]  who was one
[935.86 --> 936.86]  of the three sons
[936.86 --> 937.92]  of Herod the Great
[937.92 --> 939.62]  who divided
[939.62 --> 940.44]  his kingdom
[940.44 --> 942.28]  up to those
[942.28 --> 943.50]  his three boys
[943.50 --> 944.56]  that region
[944.56 --> 945.00]  up there
[945.00 --> 946.86]  going to Herod Antipas
[946.86 --> 951.00]  the official
[951.00 --> 952.40]  has a son
[952.40 --> 953.98]  who's sick
[953.98 --> 955.08]  and not just
[955.08 --> 955.94]  sick
[955.94 --> 957.00]  he's on his
[957.00 --> 957.52]  deathbed
[957.52 --> 960.00]  and he begs
[960.00 --> 960.34]  Jesus
[960.34 --> 961.18]  to come
[961.18 --> 962.04]  to Capernaum
[962.04 --> 962.70]  to heal
[962.70 --> 963.12]  the boy
[963.12 --> 965.40]  how would you
[965.40 --> 965.82]  feel
[965.82 --> 967.46]  that was your
[967.46 --> 967.70]  son
[967.70 --> 969.86]  how would you
[969.86 --> 970.28]  feel if that
[970.28 --> 970.90]  was your child
[970.90 --> 973.00]  who's sick
[973.00 --> 973.84]  and close
[973.84 --> 974.38]  to death
[974.38 --> 975.98]  right the doctors
[975.98 --> 976.78]  have done the best
[976.78 --> 977.28]  they could
[977.28 --> 978.04]  and are unable
[978.04 --> 978.78]  to do anything
[978.78 --> 980.36]  what would be
[980.36 --> 981.10]  your experience
[981.10 --> 982.82]  and I know
[982.82 --> 983.24]  that for some
[983.24 --> 983.62]  of us
[983.62 --> 984.38]  this morning
[984.38 --> 985.08]  that's not
[985.08 --> 985.38]  just an
[985.38 --> 985.76]  intellectual
[985.76 --> 986.34]  question
[986.34 --> 988.28]  that's a
[988.28 --> 989.02]  reality lived
[989.02 --> 993.48]  there's anxiety
[993.48 --> 995.34]  in the system
[995.34 --> 997.22]  there's fear
[997.22 --> 997.92]  and there's
[997.92 --> 998.46]  worry
[998.46 --> 1001.06]  there's
[1001.06 --> 1002.18]  chaos
[1002.18 --> 1002.96]  at no one
[1002.96 --> 1003.46]  being in
[1003.46 --> 1003.88]  control
[1003.88 --> 1006.20]  this is
[1006.20 --> 1006.42]  what we
[1006.42 --> 1007.22]  are encountering
[1007.22 --> 1008.26]  and there's
[1008.26 --> 1008.62]  trust
[1008.62 --> 1009.04]  and there's
[1009.04 --> 1009.26]  hope
[1009.26 --> 1009.66]  and there's
[1009.66 --> 1009.98]  joy
[1009.98 --> 1010.72]  right
[1010.72 --> 1011.14]  in moments
[1011.14 --> 1011.48]  like this
[1011.48 --> 1011.68]  there's
[1011.68 --> 1012.42]  this strange
[1012.42 --> 1012.92]  mix
[1012.92 --> 1013.46]  of all
[1013.46 --> 1013.88]  of these
[1013.88 --> 1014.20]  things
[1014.20 --> 1014.76]  moving
[1014.76 --> 1015.18]  around
[1015.18 --> 1015.90]  inside
[1015.90 --> 1016.36]  of us
[1016.36 --> 1017.22]  now
[1017.22 --> 1017.72]  Jesus
[1017.72 --> 1018.30]  right
[1018.30 --> 1018.84]  knows
[1018.84 --> 1019.26]  the hearts
[1019.26 --> 1019.84]  and minds
[1019.84 --> 1020.42]  of people
[1020.42 --> 1021.08]  we read
[1021.08 --> 1021.42]  that in
[1021.42 --> 1021.82]  the gospel
[1021.82 --> 1022.50]  he knows
[1022.50 --> 1022.92]  what this
[1022.92 --> 1023.32]  man is
[1023.32 --> 1023.64]  feeling
[1023.64 --> 1024.18]  he knows
[1024.18 --> 1024.96]  exactly
[1024.96 --> 1026.20]  the anxiety
[1026.20 --> 1026.76]  and worry
[1026.76 --> 1027.06]  that he
[1027.06 --> 1027.40]  has
[1027.40 --> 1027.98]  in his
[1027.98 --> 1028.28]  heart
[1028.28 --> 1030.12]  and what
[1030.12 --> 1030.60]  does Jesus
[1030.60 --> 1031.10]  say to
[1031.10 --> 1031.32]  him
[1031.32 --> 1033.86]  can I
[1033.86 --> 1034.20]  be honest
[1034.20 --> 1034.52]  with you
[1034.52 --> 1034.96]  and just
[1034.96 --> 1035.64]  blunt
[1035.64 --> 1037.84]  he doesn't
[1037.84 --> 1038.28]  say to
[1038.28 --> 1038.74]  this man
[1038.74 --> 1039.08]  what I
[1039.08 --> 1039.60]  want Jesus
[1039.60 --> 1040.10]  to say
[1040.10 --> 1042.72]  right
[1042.72 --> 1043.06]  I want
[1043.06 --> 1043.56]  Jesus to
[1043.56 --> 1043.88]  get on
[1043.88 --> 1044.42]  his horse
[1044.42 --> 1045.02]  and to
[1045.02 --> 1045.38]  go
[1045.38 --> 1046.56]  I want
[1046.56 --> 1047.10]  Jesus to
[1047.10 --> 1047.36]  say
[1047.36 --> 1048.30]  yes man
[1048.30 --> 1048.74]  I hear
[1048.74 --> 1048.92]  you
[1048.92 --> 1049.38]  I got
[1049.38 --> 1049.62]  you
[1049.62 --> 1050.16]  in my
[1050.16 --> 1050.52]  hands
[1050.52 --> 1051.08]  let's
[1051.08 --> 1051.56]  go heal
[1051.56 --> 1051.78]  that
[1051.78 --> 1052.06]  boy
[1052.06 --> 1054.58]  but he
[1054.58 --> 1055.16]  doesn't
[1055.16 --> 1056.44]  he doesn't
[1056.44 --> 1057.16]  do that
[1057.16 --> 1059.78]  he says
[1059.78 --> 1060.42]  unless you
[1060.42 --> 1061.00]  see signs
[1061.00 --> 1061.62]  and wonders
[1061.62 --> 1062.80]  you will
[1062.80 --> 1062.98]  never
[1062.98 --> 1063.46]  believe
[1063.46 --> 1064.44]  what
[1064.44 --> 1066.32]  what are
[1066.32 --> 1066.56]  we supposed
[1066.56 --> 1066.86]  to do
[1066.86 --> 1067.12]  with the
[1067.12 --> 1067.40]  Jesus
[1067.40 --> 1067.88]  who does
[1067.88 --> 1068.22]  that
[1068.22 --> 1070.36]  I suggest
[1070.36 --> 1070.68]  to you
[1070.68 --> 1071.56]  maybe we
[1071.56 --> 1071.70]  should
[1071.70 --> 1072.06]  listen
[1072.06 --> 1074.70]  I'm going
[1074.70 --> 1074.90]  to come
[1074.90 --> 1075.18]  back to
[1075.18 --> 1075.36]  in a
[1075.36 --> 1075.60]  moment
[1075.60 --> 1076.76]  but notice
[1076.76 --> 1077.04]  what the
[1077.04 --> 1077.30]  official
[1077.30 --> 1077.76]  does
[1077.76 --> 1078.36]  or rather
[1078.36 --> 1078.66]  what he
[1078.66 --> 1079.08]  doesn't
[1079.08 --> 1079.38]  do
[1079.38 --> 1080.74]  right
[1080.74 --> 1081.14]  he doesn't
[1081.14 --> 1081.60]  panic
[1081.60 --> 1082.52]  he doesn't
[1082.52 --> 1082.76]  lose
[1082.76 --> 1083.16]  heart
[1083.16 --> 1083.78]  he doesn't
[1083.78 --> 1084.32]  give up
[1084.32 --> 1085.70]  but I
[1085.70 --> 1086.16]  imagine in
[1086.16 --> 1086.56]  that moment
[1086.56 --> 1086.78]  he
[1086.78 --> 1087.60]  would take
[1087.60 --> 1087.92]  a deep
[1087.92 --> 1088.24]  breath
[1088.24 --> 1088.58]  he would
[1088.58 --> 1089.00]  step
[1089.00 --> 1089.74]  one more
[1089.74 --> 1090.08]  step
[1090.08 --> 1090.74]  closer to
[1090.74 --> 1091.04]  Jesus
[1091.04 --> 1091.72]  and he
[1091.72 --> 1092.08]  would say
[1092.08 --> 1092.52]  sir
[1092.52 --> 1093.58]  please
[1093.58 --> 1094.42]  come
[1094.42 --> 1095.24]  before my
[1095.24 --> 1096.14]  child dies
[1096.14 --> 1099.14]  to which
[1099.14 --> 1099.76]  Jesus then
[1099.76 --> 1100.22]  says
[1100.22 --> 1101.26]  go
[1101.26 --> 1102.76]  your son
[1102.76 --> 1104.08]  will live
[1104.08 --> 1106.46]  that's it
[1106.46 --> 1108.56]  that's all
[1108.56 --> 1109.16]  he says
[1109.16 --> 1110.64]  right
[1110.64 --> 1111.64]  a word
[1111.64 --> 1112.26]  from Jesus
[1112.26 --> 1112.54]  right
[1112.54 --> 1113.12]  five words
[1113.12 --> 1113.42]  really
[1113.42 --> 1114.52]  one sentence
[1114.52 --> 1116.54]  and that's
[1116.54 --> 1117.04]  the thread
[1117.04 --> 1117.68]  that I
[1117.68 --> 1117.88]  want to
[1117.88 --> 1118.38]  pull on
[1118.38 --> 1119.38]  for a
[1119.38 --> 1119.62]  moment
[1119.62 --> 1121.36]  life
[1121.36 --> 1122.10]  comes to
[1122.10 --> 1122.72]  this boy
[1122.72 --> 1124.64]  from a
[1124.64 --> 1125.22]  word
[1125.22 --> 1126.92]  from Jesus
[1126.92 --> 1128.98]  he doesn't
[1128.98 --> 1129.44]  do anything
[1129.44 --> 1129.82]  else
[1129.82 --> 1130.94]  right
[1130.94 --> 1131.38]  he simply
[1131.38 --> 1132.06]  speaks
[1132.06 --> 1133.32]  it's not
[1133.32 --> 1133.86]  dramatic
[1133.86 --> 1134.70]  it might
[1134.70 --> 1135.10]  even seem
[1135.10 --> 1135.96]  anticlimactic
[1135.96 --> 1136.74]  in the midst
[1136.74 --> 1136.98]  of it
[1136.98 --> 1137.54]  but the
[1137.54 --> 1138.04]  reality is
[1138.04 --> 1138.92]  that's all
[1138.92 --> 1139.62]  you need
[1139.62 --> 1141.68]  one word
[1141.68 --> 1142.96]  from Jesus
[1142.96 --> 1145.22]  his word
[1145.22 --> 1146.16]  gives
[1146.16 --> 1147.00]  you
[1147.00 --> 1148.20]  life
[1148.20 --> 1150.52]  and here's
[1150.52 --> 1150.90]  the thing
[1150.90 --> 1151.20]  right
[1151.20 --> 1151.78]  again
[1151.78 --> 1152.52]  let's be
[1152.52 --> 1152.80]  honest
[1152.80 --> 1153.16]  with each
[1153.16 --> 1153.38]  other
[1153.38 --> 1154.74]  we kind
[1154.74 --> 1155.08]  of want
[1155.08 --> 1155.32]  more
[1155.32 --> 1155.76]  from him
[1155.76 --> 1156.64]  am I
[1156.64 --> 1156.90]  right
[1156.90 --> 1157.74]  right
[1157.74 --> 1158.04]  we want
[1158.04 --> 1158.76]  some display
[1158.76 --> 1159.38]  of power
[1159.38 --> 1160.04]  we want
[1160.04 --> 1160.40]  something
[1160.40 --> 1160.92]  exciting
[1160.92 --> 1161.68]  and dramatic
[1161.68 --> 1162.18]  but all
[1162.18 --> 1162.74]  he does
[1162.74 --> 1164.10]  is speak
[1164.10 --> 1165.66]  it's
[1165.66 --> 1166.20]  ordinary
[1166.20 --> 1167.42]  it's
[1167.42 --> 1167.82]  simple
[1167.82 --> 1168.64]  it's
[1168.64 --> 1169.20]  straightforward
[1169.20 --> 1170.12]  and it
[1170.12 --> 1170.84]  is filled
[1170.84 --> 1171.44]  with the
[1171.44 --> 1171.84]  power
[1171.84 --> 1172.56]  of the
[1172.56 --> 1172.90]  life
[1172.90 --> 1173.44]  of the
[1173.44 --> 1173.76]  spirit
[1173.76 --> 1175.32]  it is
[1175.32 --> 1176.10]  his word
[1176.10 --> 1176.74]  filled
[1176.74 --> 1177.08]  with the
[1177.08 --> 1177.42]  power
[1177.42 --> 1178.00]  of life
[1178.00 --> 1178.72]  and his
[1178.72 --> 1179.12]  word
[1179.12 --> 1180.08]  is all
[1180.08 --> 1180.58]  you
[1180.58 --> 1181.22]  need
[1181.22 --> 1182.72]  if there
[1182.72 --> 1183.02]  was one
[1183.02 --> 1183.34]  theme
[1183.34 --> 1183.54]  that we
[1183.54 --> 1183.88]  could take
[1183.88 --> 1184.12]  home
[1184.12 --> 1184.44]  kids
[1184.44 --> 1184.66]  if
[1184.66 --> 1184.98]  your
[1184.98 --> 1186.10]  parents
[1186.10 --> 1186.32]  are going
[1186.32 --> 1186.64]  to ask
[1186.64 --> 1186.80]  you
[1186.80 --> 1187.20]  in a
[1187.20 --> 1187.38]  few
[1187.38 --> 1187.74]  hours
[1187.74 --> 1188.18]  what
[1188.18 --> 1188.40]  this
[1188.40 --> 1188.70]  service
[1188.70 --> 1188.92]  was
[1188.92 --> 1189.24]  about
[1189.24 --> 1189.88]  that's
[1189.88 --> 1190.04]  the
[1190.04 --> 1190.40]  answer
[1190.40 --> 1190.94]  his
[1190.94 --> 1191.32]  word
[1191.32 --> 1191.64]  is
[1191.64 --> 1191.86]  all
[1191.86 --> 1192.06]  you
[1192.06 --> 1192.34]  need
[1192.34 --> 1193.76]  that's
[1193.76 --> 1193.88]  what
[1193.88 --> 1194.06]  this
[1194.06 --> 1194.18]  is
[1194.18 --> 1194.46]  about
[1194.46 --> 1194.98]  that's
[1194.98 --> 1195.16]  what's
