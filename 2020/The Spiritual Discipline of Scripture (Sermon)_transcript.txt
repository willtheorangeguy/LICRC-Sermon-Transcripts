[0.00 --> 5.32]  You know, I mentioned I'm semi-retired.
[5.32 --> 12.34]  It's been said before, I work part-time for Resource Leadership International,
[12.72 --> 19.38]  and resources involved with about a dozen schools in a variety of countries,
[19.52 --> 25.86]  but with our partners in the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, and Europe,
[25.86 --> 31.64]  we're in about 120 to 30 schools in 70 countries,
[31.64 --> 36.58]  and we don't know of one school that didn't shut down.
[37.70 --> 43.72]  And so we transitioned our ministry to doing what a lot of churches around the world had to do,
[43.88 --> 47.58]  to help schools teach online.
[47.58 --> 54.44]  And, for example, there's a school in Cairo, Egypt,
[54.44 --> 62.00]  that had been getting invitations from the Arab world to help them,
[62.38 --> 65.20]  and they just didn't have the potential to do that.
[65.32 --> 69.40]  So we've helped them to improve their technology,
[69.90 --> 74.68]  and so now they're beginning to teach people throughout the Arabic world
[74.68 --> 78.86]  by first themselves having been forced to teach online,
[79.24 --> 84.30]  and now being able to broadcast this into the world around them.
[84.40 --> 90.62]  So there are upsides to what I would call a COVID operation,
[91.30 --> 96.10]  but there's been many, many downsides as well.
[96.86 --> 102.00]  Whereas in Vietnam, in the whole country,
[102.00 --> 103.84]  I don't believe there was one death.
[104.50 --> 106.54]  A couple weeks ago I heard of in Bolivia
[106.54 --> 110.96]  that over a hundred pastors died due to it.
[111.56 --> 113.60]  Now I can't verify statistics,
[113.98 --> 117.60]  but it's such an unpredictable thing.
[118.66 --> 122.44]  It's created such uncertainty in our own lives
[122.44 --> 124.38]  as to how do you respond to this.
[124.38 --> 128.52]  And so I experienced some of that own,
[129.02 --> 133.56]  you might say, confusion in my own soul
[133.56 --> 134.78]  as to what to do.
[136.54 --> 138.40]  But we're privileged to worship,
[138.86 --> 144.92]  and today I would like to turn again to the Scriptures
[144.92 --> 146.96]  with a focus this morning
[146.96 --> 151.82]  on the spiritual discipline of Scripture.
[154.60 --> 157.00]  I'd love to do a little survey and ask,
[157.66 --> 159.90]  how much do you actually read the Bible?
[161.58 --> 163.86]  Is it as much as you watch the news?
[168.86 --> 170.96]  Scripture is a primary means
[170.96 --> 175.64]  by which the Spirit uses to shape
[175.64 --> 181.02]  who we are into the person of Christ.
[181.28 --> 185.70]  We're going to turn in a moment to Peter
[185.70 --> 189.94]  and take up where we left last week
[189.94 --> 192.16]  on 2 Peter chapter 1.
[193.34 --> 196.74]  But there in the verses 12 and following,
[196.74 --> 200.80]  he speaks to the importance of Scripture
[200.80 --> 202.22]  in our lives.
[203.22 --> 206.12]  And before we turn to it,
[207.18 --> 208.34]  I'd like to remind you,
[208.36 --> 209.68]  I mentioned it last week,
[209.74 --> 211.20]  of this little acronym,
[211.98 --> 214.32]  acronym VIM.
[215.18 --> 216.36]  V-I-M.
[216.60 --> 219.16]  It can, I think, be a helpful tool
[219.16 --> 221.62]  in remembering the process
[221.62 --> 223.58]  of spiritual formation
[223.58 --> 226.16]  where V in the VIM stands for vision,
[226.72 --> 228.76]  I stands for our own intent,
[229.20 --> 231.12]  and M, which we're looking at this morning,
[231.22 --> 232.64]  is the means whereby
[232.64 --> 235.50]  God uses to shape us.
[235.76 --> 237.60]  I think it's also a helpful tool
[237.60 --> 238.38]  in understanding
[238.38 --> 240.68]  what Peter's talking about,
[240.80 --> 241.56]  writing about,
[241.82 --> 243.50]  in 2 Peter chapter 1.
[243.98 --> 246.10]  Because at the beginning of the chapter,
[246.40 --> 248.26]  he speaks about getting really
[248.26 --> 250.00]  this vision of Christ.
[250.00 --> 253.12]  In verse 3, he said,
[253.98 --> 256.40]  His divine power has given us
[256.40 --> 258.28]  everything we need
[258.28 --> 259.50]  for a godly life.
[259.62 --> 260.06]  How?
[261.08 --> 263.76]  Through our knowledge of Him,
[264.32 --> 264.76]  Jesus,
[265.86 --> 267.16]  who called us
[267.16 --> 269.70]  by His own glory and goodness.
[269.80 --> 270.36]  In other words,
[270.76 --> 271.88]  we got a vision,
[272.10 --> 275.36]  we saw who this Jesus is,
[275.70 --> 278.22]  and by calling us into that,
[278.22 --> 280.82]  we've been given this power
[280.82 --> 283.48]  to live a new life.
[283.70 --> 284.40]  In other words,
[284.88 --> 288.06]  once we get the true vision
[288.06 --> 291.24]  of who Jesus is,
[292.62 --> 294.30]  that God of heaven and earth
[294.30 --> 295.84]  come in the flesh
[295.84 --> 298.56]  so that we body and soul people
[298.56 --> 300.54]  can take on the divine nature,
[301.26 --> 302.16]  it's like,
[302.40 --> 302.76]  okay,
[303.76 --> 306.02]  I see who He is,
[306.02 --> 307.66]  I want to share in that.
[308.22 --> 311.24]  The second thing we looked at last week
[311.24 --> 312.44]  in verses 5
[312.44 --> 313.14]  is that
[313.14 --> 315.56]  it's not going to happen
[315.56 --> 317.72]  if we don't intentionally then
[317.72 --> 319.16]  pursue the vision.
[320.52 --> 321.42]  Catch it,
[322.14 --> 322.90]  follow it.
[323.66 --> 324.66]  For this reason,
[324.76 --> 325.90]  we saw in verse 5,
[326.00 --> 326.48]  because,
[326.76 --> 327.30]  in other words,
[327.34 --> 328.56]  of who Jesus is,
[329.08 --> 330.54]  make every effort
[330.54 --> 333.44]  to add to this faith vision
[333.44 --> 335.46]  the qualities of knowledge,
[335.46 --> 336.42]  self-control,
[336.84 --> 337.34]  perseverance,
[337.66 --> 338.68]  and especially love.
[340.16 --> 340.66]  Well,
[341.20 --> 343.36]  once we have this vision
[343.36 --> 343.98]  and intent,
[344.14 --> 345.50]  how do you go about
[345.50 --> 347.06]  making it happen?
[347.30 --> 348.40]  That's the means.
[349.98 --> 350.68]  Well,
[350.76 --> 352.12]  we begin to practice
[352.12 --> 353.38]  the disciplines,
[354.26 --> 355.20]  the habits,
[355.20 --> 358.28]  the ways that
[358.28 --> 360.46]  open us up
[360.46 --> 361.76]  to the Spirit
[361.76 --> 363.14]  so that
[363.14 --> 365.34]  He's able to shape us
[365.34 --> 367.58]  into the image bearers
[367.58 --> 369.16]  He created us to be.
[371.22 --> 372.26]  One more word
[372.26 --> 373.16]  before we get into
[373.16 --> 375.14]  the passage about Scripture,
[375.80 --> 376.36]  and that is
[376.36 --> 377.30]  the bigger subject
[377.30 --> 378.52]  of disciplines,
[378.64 --> 379.66]  a word about that.
[380.66 --> 381.18]  They're really
[381.18 --> 382.78]  training exercises
[382.78 --> 383.34]  like,
[383.94 --> 384.24]  you know,
[384.38 --> 385.60]  practicing piano
[385.60 --> 387.16]  until you finally get it.
[390.76 --> 391.56]  Practicing,
[391.84 --> 392.60]  showing up
[392.60 --> 393.26]  for
[393.26 --> 395.46]  volleyball practices
[395.46 --> 396.94]  and doing the drills
[396.94 --> 399.08]  until you become
[399.08 --> 399.98]  good at it.
[402.42 --> 403.34]  Disciplines,
[403.68 --> 404.36]  ultimately,
[404.70 --> 405.70]  spiritual ones,
[405.82 --> 406.66]  are intended
[406.66 --> 407.88]  to help us
[407.88 --> 409.94]  do the right thing
[409.94 --> 411.78]  at the right time,
[412.38 --> 414.76]  in the right way,
[415.48 --> 418.00]  and in the right spirit,
[418.20 --> 419.36]  as someone has said.
[420.28 --> 421.30]  They help us
[421.30 --> 422.00]  bear fruit
[422.00 --> 424.20]  to do all these things
[424.20 --> 425.18]  that are involved
[425.18 --> 425.86]  with adding
[425.86 --> 427.72]  to our faith.
[427.90 --> 428.90]  And you know
[428.90 --> 430.16]  there's many disciplines,
[431.46 --> 433.06]  probably primary among them
[433.06 --> 433.84]  are being
[433.84 --> 434.90]  solitary
[434.90 --> 435.56]  and
[435.56 --> 436.80]  silent.
[438.20 --> 439.20]  So we're going to look
[439.20 --> 439.82]  at Scripture
[439.82 --> 440.76]  there's prayer,
[440.98 --> 442.18]  there's worship,
[442.66 --> 443.48]  there's service,
[443.66 --> 444.34]  there's giving,
[445.84 --> 446.96]  there's fasting.
[447.24 --> 448.42]  There's a wide variety
[448.42 --> 448.82]  of them.
[449.78 --> 451.40]  But one of the key ones
[451.40 --> 452.46]  is reading
[452.46 --> 454.08]  Scripture.
[455.26 --> 457.04]  And in order for us
[457.04 --> 459.26]  to see the importance
[459.26 --> 462.52]  of this book,
[462.66 --> 463.62]  or I should say
[463.62 --> 464.10]  this way,
[464.16 --> 465.32]  in order for us
[465.32 --> 466.18]  to want
[466.18 --> 467.46]  to discipline
[467.46 --> 468.52]  ourselves
[468.52 --> 470.42]  to read the Bible
[470.42 --> 471.26]  faithfully,
[471.46 --> 472.70]  we need to see
[472.70 --> 473.70]  how important
[473.70 --> 474.48]  a book
[474.48 --> 475.42]  it is.
[479.10 --> 480.44]  We won't bother
[480.44 --> 482.20]  with the Bible
[482.20 --> 484.16]  if we don't realize
[484.16 --> 486.34]  what kind of a book
[486.34 --> 486.88]  it is
[486.88 --> 488.32]  and why God
[488.32 --> 489.28]  had it written.
[490.56 --> 492.08]  Just like we won't bother
[492.08 --> 492.90]  with Christ
[492.90 --> 493.90]  if we don't know
[493.90 --> 494.52]  who He is
[494.52 --> 495.78]  or why He came.
[496.96 --> 498.04]  So Peter speaks
[498.04 --> 498.88]  to the importance
[498.88 --> 499.56]  of Scripture
[499.56 --> 500.48]  in our lives
[500.48 --> 501.72]  in our passage,
[501.86 --> 502.82]  2 Peter 1,
[503.06 --> 504.34]  12 to 21.
[505.70 --> 507.00]  After having spoken
[507.00 --> 507.70]  about vision
[507.70 --> 508.38]  and intent,
[508.50 --> 509.04]  he goes on
[509.04 --> 510.02]  to say in verse 12,
[510.02 --> 511.86]  so I will always
[511.86 --> 512.84]  remind you
[512.84 --> 514.58]  of these things
[514.58 --> 515.44]  even though
[515.44 --> 516.64]  you know them
[516.64 --> 517.88]  and are firmly
[517.88 --> 518.48]  established
[518.48 --> 519.36]  in the truth
[519.36 --> 520.64]  you now have.
[521.36 --> 522.74]  I think it's right
[522.74 --> 523.50]  to refresh
[523.50 --> 524.18]  your memory
[524.18 --> 525.48]  as long as I live
[525.48 --> 526.26]  in the tent
[526.26 --> 527.58]  of this body
[527.58 --> 529.88]  because I know
[529.88 --> 531.42]  that I will soon
[531.42 --> 533.28]  put it aside
[533.28 --> 535.24]  as our Lord Jesus
[535.24 --> 536.78]  has made clear
[536.78 --> 537.22]  to me.
[537.22 --> 538.50]  people often know
[538.50 --> 540.34]  when they're
[540.34 --> 542.02]  about to go.
[543.02 --> 544.56]  And I will make
[544.56 --> 545.82]  every effort
[545.82 --> 546.94]  to see
[546.94 --> 547.84]  that after
[547.84 --> 548.96]  my departure
[548.96 --> 550.76]  you will always
[550.76 --> 551.40]  be able
[551.40 --> 552.22]  to remember
[552.22 --> 553.36]  these things.
[553.74 --> 554.32]  Why?
[558.32 --> 559.72]  Because we didn't
[559.72 --> 561.00]  follow cleverly
[561.00 --> 562.22]  devised stories
[562.22 --> 563.70]  when we told
[563.70 --> 564.24]  you about
[564.24 --> 565.56]  and it really
[565.56 --> 566.68]  means the second
[566.68 --> 567.22]  coming
[567.22 --> 568.32]  of our Lord
[568.32 --> 569.34]  Jesus Christ
[569.34 --> 570.14]  in power.
[571.72 --> 572.38]  But therefore
[572.38 --> 574.44]  we were eyewitnesses
[574.44 --> 575.90]  of his majesty.
[577.18 --> 578.10]  He received
[578.10 --> 579.52]  honor and glory
[579.52 --> 580.86]  from God the Father
[580.86 --> 581.62]  when the voice
[581.62 --> 582.36]  came to him
[582.36 --> 583.30]  from the majestic
[583.30 --> 583.90]  glory.
[584.20 --> 584.76]  This is when he
[584.76 --> 585.62]  was on the mountain
[585.62 --> 586.10]  saying,
[586.70 --> 587.68]  this is my son
[587.68 --> 588.58]  whom I love.
[589.38 --> 589.90]  With him
[589.90 --> 590.98]  I'm well pleased.
[590.98 --> 592.16]  we ourselves
[592.16 --> 593.22]  heard this voice
[593.22 --> 594.40]  that came from heaven
[594.40 --> 595.46]  when we were
[595.46 --> 596.10]  with him
[596.10 --> 597.44]  on the sacred
[597.44 --> 598.02]  mountain
[598.02 --> 598.74]  and Christ
[598.74 --> 599.70]  was transfigured
[599.70 --> 600.40]  before them.
[601.88 --> 602.52]  So that's
[602.52 --> 603.36]  Peter's experience
[603.36 --> 604.12]  but he goes on
[604.12 --> 604.38]  to say,
[604.78 --> 605.58]  we also have
[605.58 --> 606.84]  this prophetic
[606.84 --> 608.06]  message as something
[608.06 --> 609.86]  completely reliable
[609.86 --> 611.26]  and you will do
[611.26 --> 611.98]  well to pay
[611.98 --> 613.10]  attention to it
[613.10 --> 615.20]  as to a light
[615.20 --> 616.30]  shining in a dark
[616.30 --> 616.90]  place
[616.90 --> 618.22]  until the day
[618.22 --> 618.98]  dawns
[618.98 --> 620.10]  and the morning
[620.10 --> 621.24]  star rises
[621.24 --> 622.74]  in your hearts.
[622.82 --> 623.48]  In other words,
[623.92 --> 625.44]  you'd read it
[625.44 --> 626.16]  until the light
[626.16 --> 626.80]  goes on
[626.80 --> 627.64]  is what he's
[627.64 --> 628.02]  saying.
[628.70 --> 629.76]  Above all,
[630.66 --> 631.62]  above all,
[631.94 --> 633.18]  you must
[633.18 --> 634.40]  understand
[634.40 --> 637.06]  that no
[637.06 --> 638.00]  prophecy of
[638.00 --> 638.38]  scripture
[638.38 --> 639.50]  came about
[639.50 --> 641.44]  by a prophet's
[641.44 --> 642.22]  own
[642.22 --> 643.26]  interpretation
[643.26 --> 644.84]  of things.
[645.52 --> 646.08]  The Bible
[646.08 --> 647.24]  is not a matter
[647.24 --> 648.52]  of private
[648.52 --> 649.46]  opinion.
[651.06 --> 652.18]  For prophecy
[652.18 --> 653.66]  never had its
[653.66 --> 654.62]  origin in the
[654.62 --> 655.46]  human will
[655.46 --> 657.76]  but prophets,
[658.04 --> 659.02]  though human,
[659.98 --> 661.78]  spoke from God
[661.78 --> 663.20]  as they were
[663.20 --> 664.54]  carried along
[664.54 --> 666.48]  by the Holy Spirit.
[667.86 --> 669.12]  Or as the message
[669.12 --> 669.62]  says,
[670.26 --> 671.42]  prophecy resulted
[671.42 --> 672.76]  when the Holy Spirit
[672.76 --> 674.18]  prompted men
[674.18 --> 675.02]  and women
[675.02 --> 676.00]  to speak
[676.00 --> 677.24]  God's word.
[679.32 --> 680.22]  Peter's talking
[680.22 --> 681.12]  about how you
[681.12 --> 681.48]  and I,
[681.58 --> 682.04]  brothers and
[682.04 --> 682.42]  sisters,
[682.90 --> 683.68]  view the Bible.
[685.48 --> 686.34]  How do you
[686.34 --> 686.74]  view it?
[686.76 --> 687.46]  Is it just a
[687.46 --> 688.48]  matter of mere
[688.48 --> 689.54]  interest,
[689.90 --> 690.42]  stories,
[691.02 --> 691.54]  teachings,
[691.84 --> 692.44]  ideas,
[692.80 --> 693.36]  gathered
[693.36 --> 694.46]  by a few
[694.46 --> 695.12]  folks
[695.12 --> 695.98]  who saw
[695.98 --> 696.68]  potential?
[697.08 --> 697.60]  This could be
[697.60 --> 698.32]  a bestseller.
[698.58 --> 699.16]  Let's put it
[699.16 --> 700.00]  together and
[700.00 --> 700.66]  publish it.
[701.42 --> 703.74]  Is this just
[703.74 --> 704.72]  another book
[704.72 --> 705.72]  that you put
[705.72 --> 706.50]  in the religious
[706.50 --> 707.72]  section of
[707.72 --> 708.64]  the library?
[710.16 --> 711.36]  If so,
[711.74 --> 712.54]  chances are
[712.54 --> 713.50]  you won't
[713.50 --> 714.50]  pick it up.
[715.80 --> 717.00]  We need
[717.00 --> 718.08]  to understand
[718.08 --> 719.50]  that this book
[719.50 --> 720.70]  is the very
[720.70 --> 723.16]  special revelation
[723.16 --> 724.60]  of God
[724.60 --> 725.58]  concerning
[725.58 --> 726.76]  who Christ
[726.76 --> 727.44]  is.
[728.58 --> 729.08]  And in the
[729.08 --> 729.82]  Old Testament,
[729.82 --> 731.42]  even though
[731.42 --> 732.10]  those writers
[732.10 --> 733.02]  were fully
[733.02 --> 733.72]  human with
[733.72 --> 734.22]  their own
[734.22 --> 735.38]  set of
[735.38 --> 737.00]  issues and
[737.00 --> 738.24]  flare-ups and
[738.24 --> 739.00]  downs and
[739.00 --> 739.62]  circumstances
[739.62 --> 740.80]  to deal
[740.80 --> 741.16]  with,
[742.02 --> 742.52]  God
[742.52 --> 743.94]  inspired them
[743.94 --> 744.64]  by His
[744.64 --> 745.50]  Holy Spirit
[745.50 --> 746.22]  to write
[746.22 --> 746.56]  what they
[746.56 --> 746.86]  did.
[748.52 --> 749.54]  He used
[749.54 --> 750.12]  prophets
[750.12 --> 750.90]  to call
[750.90 --> 751.46]  people
[751.46 --> 752.68]  back to
[752.68 --> 753.02]  Him
[753.02 --> 754.98]  while
[754.98 --> 755.66]  promising
[755.66 --> 756.42]  a Messiah
[756.42 --> 757.04]  would come.
[758.30 --> 759.08]  And the
[759.08 --> 759.74]  New Testament
[759.74 --> 760.64]  writers like
[760.64 --> 761.14]  Peter,
[761.78 --> 762.02]  he says,
[762.10 --> 762.72]  so he's
[762.72 --> 762.98]  really,
[763.14 --> 763.80]  all he has
[763.80 --> 764.26]  at this time
[764.26 --> 764.68]  is the Old
[764.68 --> 765.06]  Testament,
[765.20 --> 765.42]  right?
[766.12 --> 766.62]  He says,
[766.74 --> 767.80]  you can trust
[767.80 --> 768.20]  them,
[768.58 --> 769.22]  but now you
[769.22 --> 769.70]  can also
[769.70 --> 770.82]  trust us
[770.82 --> 771.48]  to be
[771.48 --> 772.04]  completely
[772.04 --> 772.70]  reliable
[772.70 --> 774.08]  in passing
[774.08 --> 774.96]  this message
[774.96 --> 775.40]  on.
[775.40 --> 776.40]  God
[776.40 --> 777.40]  will
[777.40 --> 777.84]  be
[777.84 --> 778.40]  to be
[778.40 --> 778.80]  God
[778.80 --> 779.40]  and I'm
[779.40 --> 780.78]  not going to
[780.78 --> 781.40]  retire,
[781.40 --> 781.84]  Peter says,
[781.84 --> 783.02]  from ever
[783.02 --> 784.20]  reminding you
[784.20 --> 785.92]  that Jesus
[785.92 --> 786.92]  is the one
[786.92 --> 787.52]  who has
[787.52 --> 788.28]  delivered on
[788.28 --> 789.14]  all what
[789.14 --> 789.52]  the Old
[789.52 --> 789.96]  Testament
[789.96 --> 790.60]  promised.
[791.88 --> 792.42]  He's this
[792.42 --> 793.14]  bright light
[793.14 --> 794.12]  that shines
[794.12 --> 795.34]  into all
[795.34 --> 796.00]  of your
[796.00 --> 796.74]  and my
[796.74 --> 797.44]  dark
[797.44 --> 798.06]  corners
[798.06 --> 798.80]  if you'll
[798.80 --> 799.14]  let him.
[799.14 --> 801.54]  he's so
[801.54 --> 802.22]  assured of
[802.22 --> 802.76]  who Jesus
[802.76 --> 803.58]  is because
[803.58 --> 804.74]  of his
[804.74 --> 805.60]  own experience.
[805.72 --> 806.36]  He witnessed
[806.36 --> 807.20]  this brilliant
[807.20 --> 808.84]  light when
[808.84 --> 809.44]  he was with
[809.44 --> 810.40]  Jesus and
[810.40 --> 811.32]  others on
[811.32 --> 811.92]  the mountain
[811.92 --> 813.56]  and there
[813.56 --> 814.02]  were Moses
[814.02 --> 814.70]  and Elijah
[814.70 --> 816.70]  and he
[816.70 --> 817.24]  heard God
[817.24 --> 817.60]  say,
[818.20 --> 818.68]  this is my
[818.68 --> 820.78]  son whom
[820.78 --> 821.50]  I love
[821.50 --> 822.78]  who is the
[822.78 --> 823.82]  focus of
[823.82 --> 824.60]  my delight.
[827.20 --> 828.06]  But don't
[828.06 --> 828.70]  just take my
[828.70 --> 829.66]  word for it.
[829.98 --> 830.34]  Peter
[830.34 --> 831.88]  emphatically
[831.88 --> 832.54]  goes on
[832.54 --> 833.32]  to insist
[833.32 --> 835.80]  this is
[835.80 --> 836.98]  one our
[836.98 --> 837.66]  entire
[837.66 --> 838.38]  scriptures
[838.38 --> 839.18]  has been
[839.18 --> 839.98]  pointed to.
[840.14 --> 840.70]  This is the
[840.70 --> 841.40]  one rather
[841.40 --> 842.40]  the Bible's
[842.40 --> 843.20]  all pointing
[843.20 --> 844.02]  to it.
[845.06 --> 845.92]  Above all
[845.92 --> 847.78]  realize
[847.78 --> 848.60]  that these
[848.60 --> 849.18]  prophets
[849.18 --> 849.92]  back there
[849.92 --> 850.82]  weren't
[850.82 --> 851.44]  just
[851.44 --> 852.54]  philosophers
[852.54 --> 853.28]  giving
[853.28 --> 854.58]  their world
[854.58 --> 855.54]  and life
[855.54 --> 855.90]  view.
[855.90 --> 858.96]  Moses and
[858.96 --> 859.98]  David just
[859.98 --> 860.68]  weren't telling
[860.68 --> 861.80]  us here's
[861.80 --> 862.46]  what I
[862.46 --> 863.16]  think.
[864.46 --> 865.10]  Those
[865.10 --> 865.72]  stories,
[866.06 --> 866.90]  those poems,
[867.52 --> 868.64]  those prophecies
[868.64 --> 870.18]  are spirit
[870.18 --> 871.10]  inspired.
[872.38 --> 873.56]  And so we
[873.56 --> 874.52]  do so well
[874.52 --> 875.58]  to pay
[875.58 --> 876.06]  attention
[876.06 --> 877.00]  to them
[877.00 --> 878.12]  and let
[878.12 --> 879.20]  that spirit
[879.20 --> 881.16]  that inspired
[881.16 --> 882.38]  them by
[882.38 --> 883.36]  reading it
[883.36 --> 884.56]  get inside
[884.56 --> 885.14]  of us.
[887.58 --> 888.34]  You know we
[888.34 --> 888.66]  have a
[888.66 --> 889.14]  confession
[889.14 --> 889.74]  that's called
[889.74 --> 890.36]  the Belgic
[890.36 --> 891.00]  Confession
[891.00 --> 891.46]  and it's
[891.46 --> 891.82]  the only
[891.82 --> 892.98]  one of
[892.98 --> 893.72]  the confessions
[893.72 --> 894.50]  that speaks
[894.50 --> 896.10]  into what
[896.10 --> 896.70]  the scriptures
[896.70 --> 897.60]  are about
[897.60 --> 898.48]  and in
[898.48 --> 899.70]  article 5
[899.70 --> 900.22]  it says
[900.22 --> 900.88]  this about
[900.88 --> 901.46]  the Bible
[901.46 --> 901.90]  it says
[901.90 --> 902.60]  we receive
[902.60 --> 903.18]  all these
[903.18 --> 903.66]  books
[903.66 --> 904.54]  and these
[904.54 --> 905.02]  only
[905.02 --> 905.36]  and it
[905.36 --> 905.86]  talks about
[905.86 --> 906.64]  the 66
[906.64 --> 907.46]  as holy
[907.46 --> 908.28]  and canonical
[908.28 --> 909.32]  for the
[909.32 --> 910.12]  regulating
[910.12 --> 911.00]  founding
[911.00 --> 912.40]  and establishing
[912.40 --> 913.36]  of our
[913.36 --> 913.78]  faith.
[915.12 --> 915.96]  And we
[915.96 --> 916.46]  believe
[916.46 --> 917.20]  without a
[917.20 --> 917.48]  doubt
[917.48 --> 918.30]  all things
[918.30 --> 919.22]  contained in
[919.22 --> 919.42]  them
[919.42 --> 920.46]  not so much
[920.46 --> 921.20]  because the
[921.20 --> 921.64]  church
[921.64 --> 922.76]  receives them
[922.76 --> 923.68]  and approves
[923.68 --> 924.40]  them as such
[924.40 --> 925.18]  because somebody
[925.18 --> 926.04]  gets up and
[926.04 --> 926.72]  says you
[926.72 --> 927.06]  want to
[927.06 --> 927.70]  believe this
[927.70 --> 929.20]  but above
[929.20 --> 930.20]  all because
[930.20 --> 931.06]  the Holy
[931.06 --> 931.80]  Spirit
[931.80 --> 933.12]  testifies
[933.12 --> 934.10]  in our
[934.10 --> 934.56]  hearts
[934.56 --> 935.16]  that they
[935.16 --> 935.62]  are from
[935.62 --> 936.00]  God.
[936.00 --> 937.24]  but he
[937.24 --> 937.64]  can't
[937.64 --> 938.10]  testify
[938.10 --> 938.76]  if you
[938.76 --> 939.04]  don't
[939.04 --> 939.54]  read it.
[941.98 --> 942.88]  And also
[942.88 --> 943.24]  it goes
[943.24 --> 943.62]  on to
[943.62 --> 943.84]  say
[943.84 --> 945.26]  we know
[945.26 --> 945.50]  they're
[945.50 --> 945.70]  true
[945.70 --> 946.08]  because
[946.08 --> 946.30]  they
[946.30 --> 946.70]  prove
[946.70 --> 947.16]  themselves
[947.16 --> 947.98]  to be
[947.98 --> 948.52]  from
[948.52 --> 948.94]  God.
[949.04 --> 949.26]  Even
[949.26 --> 949.86]  the blind
[949.86 --> 950.40]  themselves
[950.40 --> 950.94]  are able
[950.94 --> 951.38]  to see
[951.38 --> 952.04]  the things
[952.04 --> 952.80]  predicted
[952.80 --> 953.34]  in them
[953.34 --> 954.06]  happen.
[956.92 --> 957.88]  The only
[957.88 --> 958.42]  way the
[958.42 --> 958.84]  Bible
[958.84 --> 959.42]  is going
[959.42 --> 960.06]  to become
[960.06 --> 961.14]  authoritative
[961.14 --> 961.96]  in your
[961.96 --> 962.70]  or my
[962.70 --> 963.30]  life
[963.30 --> 965.00]  is if
[965.00 --> 965.50]  we read
[965.50 --> 965.70]  it.
[966.00 --> 969.26]  if we
[969.26 --> 969.84]  accept
[969.84 --> 970.20]  it
[970.20 --> 971.06]  as we
[971.06 --> 971.62]  read it
[971.62 --> 972.48]  as the
[972.48 --> 972.96]  word
[972.96 --> 973.92]  of
[973.92 --> 974.34]  and
[974.34 --> 974.76]  from
[974.76 --> 975.26]  God.
[977.30 --> 978.00]  Today
[978.00 --> 979.00]  the primary
[979.00 --> 979.86]  text
[979.86 --> 980.70]  of most
[980.70 --> 981.28]  people
[981.28 --> 982.38]  which we
[982.38 --> 982.92]  take as
[982.92 --> 983.46]  the final
[983.46 --> 984.00]  authority
[984.00 --> 984.42]  often
[984.42 --> 984.76]  is
[984.76 --> 986.00]  ourselves.
[986.72 --> 987.22]  In our
[987.22 --> 987.64]  secular
[987.64 --> 988.20]  age
[988.20 --> 990.22]  we do
[990.22 --> 990.94]  not turn
[990.94 --> 991.28]  in our
[991.28 --> 991.74]  culture
[991.74 --> 993.00]  to a
[993.00 --> 993.42]  word
[993.42 --> 994.08]  that we
[994.08 --> 994.60]  believe
[994.60 --> 995.48]  is from
[995.48 --> 995.88]  God.
[998.52 --> 999.24]  We
[999.24 --> 999.76]  will only
[999.76 --> 1000.40]  subject
[1000.40 --> 1001.00]  ourselves
[1001.00 --> 1001.36]  to
[1001.36 --> 1001.74]  scripture
[1001.74 --> 1003.46]  when we
[1003.46 --> 1003.92]  are willing
[1003.92 --> 1004.66]  to submit
[1004.66 --> 1005.22]  that the
[1005.22 --> 1005.70]  Spirit
[1005.70 --> 1006.70]  authored
[1006.70 --> 1007.92]  this book.
[1008.92 --> 1009.86]  If you
[1009.86 --> 1010.26]  and I
[1010.26 --> 1010.98]  want to be
[1010.98 --> 1011.90]  carried along
[1011.90 --> 1012.70]  or learn
[1012.70 --> 1013.24]  to live
[1013.24 --> 1013.78]  with as
[1013.78 --> 1014.36]  Galatians
[1014.36 --> 1014.70]  says
[1014.70 --> 1015.58]  in step
[1015.58 --> 1015.94]  with the
[1015.94 --> 1016.82]  Holy Spirit
[1016.82 --> 1017.74]  I need
[1017.74 --> 1018.32]  to accept
[1018.32 --> 1018.80]  this is
[1018.80 --> 1019.18]  God's
[1019.18 --> 1019.90]  love story.
[1019.90 --> 1021.72]  I need
[1021.72 --> 1022.38]  to identify
[1022.38 --> 1023.26]  myself
[1023.26 --> 1023.80]  with it
[1023.80 --> 1025.88]  and see
[1025.88 --> 1026.42]  that this
[1026.42 --> 1027.24]  tells the
[1027.24 --> 1027.94]  whole story
[1027.94 --> 1028.30]  of what
[1028.30 --> 1028.72]  God's
[1028.72 --> 1029.38]  up to
[1029.38 --> 1030.30]  on this
[1030.30 --> 1030.66]  earth
[1030.66 --> 1032.72]  because
[1032.72 --> 1033.40]  then I'll
[1033.40 --> 1034.22]  begin
[1034.22 --> 1035.12]  to let
[1035.12 --> 1035.42]  it
[1035.42 --> 1036.70]  regulate
[1036.70 --> 1038.28]  my life.
[1040.68 --> 1041.66]  The Bible
[1041.66 --> 1042.08]  is there
[1042.08 --> 1042.44]  as the
[1042.44 --> 1042.96]  confession
[1042.96 --> 1043.36]  says
[1043.36 --> 1043.74]  for the
[1043.74 --> 1044.46]  regulating
[1044.46 --> 1045.56]  founding
[1045.56 --> 1046.20]  and
[1046.20 --> 1046.98]  establishing
[1046.98 --> 1048.16]  of our
[1048.16 --> 1048.60]  faith.
[1049.94 --> 1050.38]  One of the
[1050.38 --> 1050.92]  first things
[1050.92 --> 1051.34]  it does
[1051.34 --> 1051.80]  is help
[1051.80 --> 1052.72]  help me
[1052.72 --> 1053.38]  believe
[1053.38 --> 1054.84]  that Christ
[1054.84 --> 1055.36]  is the
[1055.36 --> 1055.68]  one.
[1056.96 --> 1057.24]  It goes
[1057.24 --> 1057.56]  on
[1057.56 --> 1058.14]  the
[1058.14 --> 1058.60]  confession
[1058.60 --> 1058.94]  does

[1059.96 --> 1060.48]  to talk
[1060.48 --> 1060.72]  about
[1060.72 --> 1060.94]  the
[1060.94 --> 1061.56]  sufficiency
[1061.56 --> 1061.92]  of
[1061.92 --> 1062.44]  scripture.
[1063.06 --> 1063.40]  It
[1063.40 --> 1063.78]  states
[1063.78 --> 1064.16]  this
[1064.16 --> 1064.62]  in
[1064.62 --> 1065.24]  Belgic
[1065.24 --> 1065.74]  Confession
[1065.74 --> 1066.08]  article
[1066.08 --> 1066.56]  7
[1066.56 --> 1066.78]  we
[1066.78 --> 1067.32]  believe
[1067.32 --> 1067.62]  this
[1067.62 --> 1068.34]  holy
[1068.34 --> 1069.16]  scripture
[1069.16 --> 1070.46]  contains
[1070.46 --> 1070.78]  the
[1070.78 --> 1071.00]  will
[1071.00 --> 1071.20]  of
[1071.20 --> 1071.48]  God
[1071.48 --> 1072.40]  completely
[1072.40 --> 1073.32]  and
[1073.32 --> 1073.62]  that
[1073.62 --> 1075.04]  everything
[1075.04 --> 1075.66]  one
[1075.66 --> 1076.06]  must
[1076.06 --> 1076.68]  believe
[1076.68 --> 1077.20]  to be
[1077.20 --> 1077.86]  saved.
[1078.86 --> 1079.54]  In other
[1079.54 --> 1079.84]  words it
[1079.84 --> 1080.50]  limits the
[1080.50 --> 1080.80]  purpose
[1080.80 --> 1081.18]  of the
[1081.18 --> 1081.58]  scriptures.
[1082.14 --> 1082.48]  Everything
[1082.48 --> 1083.04]  one
[1083.04 --> 1083.62]  must
[1083.62 --> 1083.96]  believe
[1083.96 --> 1084.44]  to be
[1084.44 --> 1085.44]  saved
[1085.44 --> 1085.96]  is
[1085.96 --> 1086.78]  sufficiently
[1086.78 --> 1087.26]  taught
[1087.26 --> 1087.70]  in it.
[1091.14 --> 1091.84]  There's a
[1091.84 --> 1092.42]  story in
[1092.42 --> 1093.22]  John 5
[1093.22 --> 1093.80]  where Jesus
[1093.80 --> 1094.40]  is in
[1094.40 --> 1094.76]  debate
[1094.76 --> 1095.16]  with the
[1095.16 --> 1095.50]  Jewish
[1095.50 --> 1095.92]  leaders.
[1096.08 --> 1096.40]  They were
[1096.40 --> 1097.50]  Old Testament
[1097.50 --> 1098.14]  scholars
[1098.14 --> 1098.60]  and they
[1098.60 --> 1099.06]  loved the
[1099.06 --> 1099.38]  Bible.
[1099.54 --> 1099.80]  It was
[1099.80 --> 1100.42]  their pride
[1100.42 --> 1101.08]  and joy
[1101.08 --> 1102.62]  but they
[1102.62 --> 1102.98]  hadn't
[1102.98 --> 1103.34]  gotten
[1103.34 --> 1103.66]  the
[1103.66 --> 1104.10]  message.
[1104.28 --> 1104.40]  They
[1104.40 --> 1104.78]  hadn't
[1104.78 --> 1105.22]  let it
[1105.22 --> 1105.78]  penetrate
[1105.78 --> 1106.40]  their own
[1106.40 --> 1106.80]  souls.
[1107.14 --> 1107.40]  This
[1107.40 --> 1107.78]  is what
[1107.78 --> 1108.10]  Jesus
[1108.10 --> 1108.60]  said to
[1108.60 --> 1108.80]  them
[1108.80 --> 1108.98]  in
[1108.98 --> 1109.24]  John
[1109.24 --> 1109.74]  5
[1109.74 --> 1110.24]  39.
[1111.24 --> 1111.36]  He
[1111.36 --> 1111.66]  said
[1111.66 --> 1111.82]  you
[1111.82 --> 1112.24]  study
[1112.24 --> 1112.52]  the
[1112.52 --> 1112.90]  scriptures
[1112.90 --> 1113.66]  diligently
[1113.66 --> 1114.12]  because
[1114.12 --> 1114.40]  you
[1114.40 --> 1114.80]  think
[1114.80 --> 1115.14]  that
[1115.14 --> 1115.56]  in
[1115.56 --> 1116.12]  them
[1116.12 --> 1116.92]  you
[1116.92 --> 1117.56]  have
[1117.56 --> 1118.64]  eternal
[1118.64 --> 1119.50]  life.
[1120.36 --> 1121.04]  These
[1121.04 --> 1121.44]  are the
[1121.44 --> 1121.84]  very
[1121.84 --> 1122.46]  scriptures
[1122.46 --> 1123.16]  that
[1123.16 --> 1123.84]  testify
[1123.84 --> 1125.40]  about
[1125.40 --> 1126.12]  me
[1126.12 --> 1127.92]  yet
[1127.92 --> 1128.22]  you
[1128.22 --> 1129.04]  refuse
[1129.04 --> 1129.66]  to
[1129.66 --> 1130.06]  come
[1130.06 --> 1130.32]  to
[1130.32 --> 1130.74]  me
[1130.74 --> 1131.52]  to
[1131.52 --> 1131.82]  have
[1131.82 --> 1132.24]  life.
[1132.24 --> 1136.36]  the
[1136.36 --> 1136.68]  scriptures
[1136.68 --> 1136.98]  are
[1136.98 --> 1137.28]  written
[1137.28 --> 1138.98]  to
[1138.98 --> 1139.34]  point
[1139.34 --> 1139.62]  us

[1140.36 --> 1141.24]  of
[1141.24 --> 1141.92]  salvation
[1141.92 --> 1142.54]  and
[1142.54 --> 1143.08]  life.
[1145.12 --> 1145.56]  The

[1146.42 --> 1146.62]  that
[1146.62 --> 1146.86]  come
[1146.86 --> 1147.08]  through
[1147.08 --> 1147.60]  scriptures
[1147.60 --> 1147.92]  what
[1147.92 --> 1148.32]  Paul
[1148.32 --> 1149.44]  empathizes

[1161.40 --> 1161.76]  writes
[1161.76 --> 1161.98]  you

[1241.26 --> 1242.10]  make you
[1242.10 --> 1243.04]  wise
[1243.04 --> 1244.14]  for
[1244.14 --> 1245.06]  salvation
[1245.06 --> 1245.80]  through
[1245.80 --> 1246.48]  faith
[1246.48 --> 1247.36]  in
[1247.36 --> 1247.80]  Christ
[1247.80 --> 1248.46]  Jesus
[1248.46 --> 1250.58]  all
[1250.58 --> 1251.20]  scriptures
[1251.20 --> 1251.84]  God
[1251.84 --> 1253.02]  breathed
[1253.02 --> 1254.18]  spirit
[1254.18 --> 1254.92]  inspired
[1254.92 --> 1256.20]  useful
[1256.20 --> 1257.08]  for
[1257.08 --> 1257.84]  teaching
[1257.84 --> 1259.44]  rebuking
[1259.44 --> 1260.74]  correcting
[1260.74 --> 1261.82]  and
[1261.82 --> 1262.48]  training
[1262.48 --> 1262.90]  in
[1262.90 --> 1263.70]  righteousness
[1263.70 --> 1265.34]  so that
[1265.34 --> 1266.34]  the servant
[1266.34 --> 1267.08]  of God
[1267.08 --> 1268.00]  may be
[1268.00 --> 1268.70]  thoroughly
[1268.70 --> 1269.38]  equipped
[1269.38 --> 1270.42]  for
[1270.42 --> 1271.02]  every
[1271.02 --> 1271.90]  good
[1271.90 --> 1272.36]  work
[1272.36 --> 1276.84]  now I don't
[1276.84 --> 1277.44]  want to force
[1277.44 --> 1278.08]  a structure
[1278.08 --> 1278.62]  on this
[1278.62 --> 1279.08]  passage
[1279.08 --> 1279.92]  as I speak
[1279.92 --> 1280.72]  further on
[1280.72 --> 1280.94]  it
[1280.94 --> 1282.22]  one that's
[1282.22 --> 1282.76]  not there
[1282.76 --> 1284.36]  but I think
[1284.36 --> 1284.78]  it may be
[1284.78 --> 1285.42]  helpful to
[1285.42 --> 1285.90]  see how
[1285.90 --> 1286.42]  what Paul
[1286.42 --> 1287.20]  is attributing
[1287.20 --> 1288.06]  to the work
[1288.06 --> 1289.14]  of scripture
[1289.14 --> 1289.80]  in our
[1289.80 --> 1290.38]  lives
[1290.38 --> 1292.00]  is similar
[1292.00 --> 1292.66]  to what
[1292.66 --> 1293.44]  Jesus said
[1293.44 --> 1294.02]  the work
[1294.02 --> 1294.30]  of the
[1294.30 --> 1295.08]  Holy Spirit
[1295.08 --> 1295.86]  is in
[1295.86 --> 1297.22]  John 16
[1297.22 --> 1297.86]  where he
[1297.86 --> 1298.30]  said the
[1298.30 --> 1299.04]  spirit would
[1299.04 --> 1300.36]  come and
[1300.36 --> 1301.32]  convict the
[1301.32 --> 1302.06]  world of
[1302.06 --> 1303.14]  three things
[1303.14 --> 1304.48]  the spirit
[1304.48 --> 1305.22]  would convict
[1305.22 --> 1305.68]  the world
[1305.68 --> 1306.54]  of sin
[1306.54 --> 1308.24]  of righteousness
[1308.24 --> 1309.42]  and he
[1309.42 --> 1309.88]  mentions
[1309.88 --> 1310.40]  judgment
[1310.40 --> 1310.92]  but what
[1310.92 --> 1312.06]  Jesus means
[1312.06 --> 1312.82]  is and
[1312.82 --> 1313.42]  freedom
[1313.42 --> 1314.60]  from eternal
[1314.60 --> 1315.10]  judgment
[1315.10 --> 1318.28]  when the
[1318.28 --> 1319.36]  spirit convicts
[1319.36 --> 1320.04]  us that we
[1320.04 --> 1321.10]  are no longer
[1321.10 --> 1321.78]  under the
[1321.78 --> 1322.48]  judgment of
[1322.48 --> 1322.88]  God
[1322.88 --> 1323.76]  that's the
[1323.76 --> 1324.40]  same as
[1324.40 --> 1325.30]  believing that
[1325.30 --> 1326.10]  our salvation
[1326.10 --> 1327.36]  comes completely
[1327.36 --> 1328.92]  in Christ
[1328.92 --> 1331.34]  the spirit
[1331.34 --> 1332.58]  convicting us
[1332.58 --> 1333.34]  of sin
[1333.34 --> 1334.08]  relates to
[1334.08 --> 1334.88]  Paul saying
[1334.88 --> 1335.30]  that the
[1335.30 --> 1336.04]  scriptures are
[1336.04 --> 1336.92]  meant for
[1336.92 --> 1338.40]  rebuking and
[1338.40 --> 1339.04]  correcting
[1339.04 --> 1341.64]  and the
[1341.64 --> 1342.68]  spirit convicting
[1342.68 --> 1343.28]  us of
[1343.28 --> 1344.22]  righteousness
[1344.22 --> 1345.50]  relates to
[1345.50 --> 1346.08]  how as he
[1346.08 --> 1346.60]  says the
[1346.60 --> 1348.12]  scriptures are
[1348.12 --> 1348.94]  there to
[1348.94 --> 1349.94]  train us
[1349.94 --> 1351.44]  in righteousness
[1351.44 --> 1352.74]  so we can
[1352.74 --> 1353.24]  live this
[1353.24 --> 1354.18]  mature life
[1354.18 --> 1356.52]  by the way
[1356.52 --> 1357.58]  I think this
[1357.58 --> 1358.24]  is also the
[1358.24 --> 1359.00]  three parts of
[1359.00 --> 1359.60]  the Heidelberg
[1359.60 --> 1360.36]  Catechism
[1360.36 --> 1362.68]  the three things
[1362.68 --> 1363.30]  we need to
[1363.30 --> 1363.62]  know
[1363.62 --> 1365.20]  how great our
[1365.20 --> 1365.96]  sin is
[1365.96 --> 1367.34]  how great our
[1367.34 --> 1368.22]  redemption is
[1368.22 --> 1368.92]  the order is a
[1368.92 --> 1369.38]  little different
[1369.38 --> 1370.96]  and how we can
[1370.96 --> 1371.88]  say thank you to
[1371.88 --> 1372.62]  God through a
[1372.62 --> 1373.60]  life of obedience
[1373.60 --> 1374.76]  through all that
[1374.76 --> 1375.38]  he's done for
[1375.38 --> 1377.54]  us and these
[1377.54 --> 1378.46]  three things
[1378.46 --> 1380.38]  give us three
[1380.38 --> 1381.72]  reasons to
[1381.72 --> 1383.02]  read the
[1383.02 --> 1385.30]  Bible the
[1385.30 --> 1386.34]  first reason
[1386.34 --> 1387.30]  is to help
[1387.30 --> 1388.48]  us to know
[1388.48 --> 1389.94]  how we may be
[1389.94 --> 1391.58]  saved through
[1391.58 --> 1392.42]  our Lord Jesus
[1392.42 --> 1394.50]  Christ and
[1394.50 --> 1395.48]  you know we
[1395.48 --> 1396.26]  can say once
[1396.26 --> 1397.22]  saved but we
[1397.22 --> 1397.94]  need this
[1397.94 --> 1398.70]  assurance
[1398.70 --> 1399.88]  virtually
[1399.88 --> 1401.44]  every day
[1401.44 --> 1404.34]  to know
[1404.34 --> 1404.82]  again I'm
[1404.82 --> 1405.48]  loved by
[1405.48 --> 1405.90]  God
[1405.90 --> 1407.98]  and when you
[1407.98 --> 1408.40]  read through
[1408.40 --> 1409.00]  the scriptures
[1409.00 --> 1410.76]  it will confirm
[1410.76 --> 1412.24]  that to your
[1412.24 --> 1412.62]  soul
[1412.62 --> 1414.54]  because we'll
[1414.54 --> 1414.98]  know the
[1414.98 --> 1415.68]  spirit is at
[1415.68 --> 1416.78]  work you can
[1416.78 --> 1417.88]  know it if you
[1417.88 --> 1418.54]  read through the
[1418.54 --> 1418.92]  Bible
[1418.92 --> 1420.94]  and your
[1420.94 --> 1422.16]  your head's
[1422.16 --> 1422.64]  nodding
[1422.64 --> 1425.50]  you read
[1425.50 --> 1425.98]  through some
[1425.98 --> 1426.72]  of the stories
[1426.72 --> 1427.28]  and you hear
[1427.28 --> 1428.14]  what Paul says
[1428.14 --> 1429.06]  in some places
[1429.06 --> 1429.76]  in the scriptures
[1429.76 --> 1430.42]  and your heart
[1430.42 --> 1431.14]  starts beating
[1431.14 --> 1432.02]  faster and
[1432.02 --> 1433.62]  faster as it
[1433.62 --> 1434.28]  were your eyes
[1434.28 --> 1434.84]  start getting
[1434.84 --> 1437.02]  bigger that's
[1437.02 --> 1438.14]  confirmation that
[1438.14 --> 1438.80]  you and God
[1438.80 --> 1440.84]  are in sync and
[1440.84 --> 1441.50]  that he's working
[1441.50 --> 1441.98]  through his
[1441.98 --> 1442.62]  spirit his
[1442.62 --> 1443.44]  salvation in
[1443.44 --> 1445.16]  your soul gives
[1445.16 --> 1445.92]  you reason for
[1445.92 --> 1448.22]  joy like a big
[1448.22 --> 1450.44]  love letter God
[1450.44 --> 1451.56]  saying to us how
[1451.56 --> 1452.34]  much he cares
[1452.34 --> 1453.16]  about us
[1453.16 --> 1455.94]  my wife Lynn
[1455.94 --> 1457.10]  and I we did
[1457.10 --> 1457.70]  most of our
[1457.70 --> 1458.36]  courting by
[1458.36 --> 1459.54]  distance I
[1459.54 --> 1459.90]  was at
[1459.90 --> 1461.44]  Dort College
[1461.44 --> 1462.70]  in Iowa and
[1462.70 --> 1464.46]  she was in
[1464.46 --> 1465.82]  Winnipeg I
[1465.82 --> 1466.26]  could hardly
[1466.26 --> 1466.84]  wait to get
[1466.84 --> 1467.46]  those letters
[1467.46 --> 1469.12]  I was so
[1469.12 --> 1469.96]  excited I'd go
[1469.96 --> 1470.86]  alone and I'd
[1470.86 --> 1473.20]  read them I
[1473.20 --> 1474.40]  just soak it
[1474.40 --> 1476.08]  in let what
[1476.08 --> 1476.64]  she wrote
[1476.64 --> 1477.70]  penetrate
[1477.70 --> 1481.26]  and sometimes
[1481.26 --> 1481.84]  I'd read them
[1481.84 --> 1482.56]  more than once
[1482.56 --> 1485.24]  that's how we're
[1485.24 --> 1485.80]  meant to read
[1485.80 --> 1487.56]  scripture it's a
[1487.56 --> 1488.08]  love letter
[1488.08 --> 1490.96]  reminding us of
[1490.96 --> 1491.86]  who God is for
[1491.86 --> 1492.54]  us second
[1492.54 --> 1493.40]  reason is to
[1493.40 --> 1494.22]  see our sin
[1494.22 --> 1494.80]  and short
[1494.80 --> 1495.44]  comings
[1495.44 --> 1497.58]  that's the
[1497.58 --> 1498.88]  rebuking the
[1498.88 --> 1500.66]  correcting we
[1500.66 --> 1501.30]  don't like that
[1501.30 --> 1502.78]  today to
[1502.78 --> 1503.84]  rebuke and
[1503.84 --> 1505.50]  correct I
[1505.50 --> 1505.96]  think that's
[1505.96 --> 1506.92]  being negative
[1506.92 --> 1508.84]  turns people
[1508.84 --> 1509.28]  away
[1509.28 --> 1512.56]  well let me
[1512.56 --> 1513.30]  assure you we
[1513.30 --> 1514.08]  wouldn't have to
[1514.08 --> 1514.94]  do much of it
[1514.94 --> 1516.08]  if people would
[1516.08 --> 1516.98]  practice the
[1516.98 --> 1517.68]  discipline of
[1517.68 --> 1518.26]  reading the
[1518.26 --> 1519.04]  scripture because
[1519.04 --> 1520.28]  the spirit would
[1520.28 --> 1521.12]  simply get the
[1521.12 --> 1521.78]  job done
[1521.78 --> 1523.98]  the spirit's
[1523.98 --> 1524.56]  actually very
[1524.56 --> 1525.02]  good at
[1525.02 --> 1526.00]  convicting people
[1526.00 --> 1526.52]  of sin
[1526.52 --> 1527.98]  it's part of
[1527.98 --> 1529.08]  his job
[1529.08 --> 1529.72]  maybe the
[1529.72 --> 1530.64]  primary one
[1530.64 --> 1533.30]  see the word
[1533.30 --> 1533.94]  of God is
[1533.94 --> 1534.74]  the sword
[1534.74 --> 1535.88]  of the spirit
[1535.88 --> 1537.34]  it cuts
[1537.34 --> 1538.72]  to the heart
[1538.72 --> 1540.80]  convicts us
[1540.80 --> 1541.72]  when we've
[1541.72 --> 1542.50]  done wrong
[1542.50 --> 1544.54]  points us
[1544.54 --> 1545.16]  back in the
[1545.16 --> 1546.42]  right way
[1546.42 --> 1549.14]  Jesus said
[1549.14 --> 1549.46]  to his
[1549.46 --> 1550.26]  disciples in
[1550.26 --> 1550.96]  John 15
[1550.96 --> 1551.58]  that you have
[1551.58 --> 1552.78]  become clean
[1552.78 --> 1554.14]  because of
[1554.14 --> 1554.60]  what I've
[1554.60 --> 1555.52]  spoken to
[1555.52 --> 1555.90]  you
[1555.90 --> 1558.72]  and then he
[1558.72 --> 1559.38]  went on to
[1559.38 --> 1559.66]  pray
[1559.66 --> 1560.30]  father that
[1560.30 --> 1560.62]  you would
[1560.62 --> 1562.00]  sanctify them
[1562.00 --> 1563.04]  by your
[1563.04 --> 1563.92]  truth and
[1563.92 --> 1564.28]  then he
[1564.28 --> 1564.98]  added your
[1564.98 --> 1566.38]  word is
[1566.38 --> 1566.98]  truth
[1566.98 --> 1569.80]  God's word
[1569.80 --> 1570.24]  is a
[1570.24 --> 1570.98]  purifier
[1570.98 --> 1572.84]  it's his
[1572.84 --> 1573.90]  central means
[1573.90 --> 1575.10]  really to
[1575.10 --> 1575.60]  make you
[1575.60 --> 1575.94]  and me
[1575.94 --> 1576.40]  holy
[1576.40 --> 1578.54]  and if we
[1578.54 --> 1578.96]  have any
[1578.96 --> 1579.62]  desire to
[1579.62 --> 1580.32]  become like
[1580.32 --> 1580.98]  Christ we
[1580.98 --> 1581.74]  must be
[1581.74 --> 1582.64]  students of
[1582.64 --> 1582.98]  the word
[1582.98 --> 1583.44]  of God
[1583.44 --> 1586.46]  you simply
[1586.46 --> 1587.48]  cannot graduate
[1587.48 --> 1588.86]  from a
[1588.86 --> 1589.80]  university or
[1589.80 --> 1590.30]  from some
[1590.30 --> 1591.38]  classes until
[1591.38 --> 1591.98]  you've done
[1591.98 --> 1593.40]  the required
[1593.40 --> 1594.38]  reading
[1594.38 --> 1596.66]  and we
[1596.66 --> 1597.76]  cannot be
[1597.76 --> 1599.32]  apprentices in
[1599.32 --> 1600.12]  the school of
[1600.12 --> 1601.20]  Christ if we
[1601.20 --> 1602.24]  do not spend
[1602.24 --> 1603.76]  concentrated time
[1603.76 --> 1604.46]  in the
[1604.46 --> 1604.80]  scriptures
[1604.80 --> 1609.20]  so the
[1609.20 --> 1609.86]  Bible helps
[1609.86 --> 1611.16]  us know
[1611.16 --> 1611.98]  we're saved
[1611.98 --> 1612.58]  and loved
[1612.58 --> 1613.26]  but it also
[1613.26 --> 1613.96]  does this
[1613.96 --> 1615.42]  job of
[1615.42 --> 1616.22]  pointing out
[1616.22 --> 1616.78]  our sin
[1616.78 --> 1617.56]  and thirdly
[1617.56 --> 1618.12]  it teaches
[1618.12 --> 1619.48]  us how
[1619.48 --> 1620.14]  to obey
[1620.14 --> 1622.80]  it's God
[1622.80 --> 1623.66]  breathed so
[1623.66 --> 1624.42]  we can be
[1624.42 --> 1625.90]  trained to
[1625.90 --> 1626.80]  be righteous
[1626.80 --> 1628.62]  it's filled
[1628.62 --> 1629.10]  with all
[1629.10 --> 1629.86]  kinds of
[1629.86 --> 1630.94]  practical advice
[1630.94 --> 1631.86]  stories and
[1631.86 --> 1632.72]  teachings that
[1632.72 --> 1633.78]  cover the
[1633.78 --> 1634.92]  full gamut
[1634.92 --> 1635.58]  of life
[1635.58 --> 1636.76]  stuff that
[1636.76 --> 1637.26]  you don't want
[1637.26 --> 1637.94]  to talk about
[1637.94 --> 1638.58]  in public
[1638.58 --> 1639.00]  or there
[1639.00 --> 1641.46]  we can
[1641.46 --> 1641.94]  learn from
[1641.94 --> 1642.68]  the mistakes
[1642.68 --> 1643.40]  of many
[1643.40 --> 1643.80]  in that
[1643.80 --> 1644.98]  book and
[1644.98 --> 1645.52]  be guided
[1645.52 --> 1646.02]  by the
[1646.02 --> 1647.66]  wisdom of
[1647.66 --> 1648.10]  others
[1648.10 --> 1650.06]  and no
[1650.06 --> 1650.52]  matter how
[1650.52 --> 1651.12]  many times
[1651.12 --> 1651.50]  you read
[1651.50 --> 1651.78]  it you
[1651.78 --> 1652.58]  keep learning
[1652.58 --> 1655.36]  see things
[1655.36 --> 1655.80]  you didn't
[1655.80 --> 1656.34]  before
[1656.34 --> 1658.12]  so that in
[1658.12 --> 1658.70]  the end we
[1658.70 --> 1659.06]  may be
[1659.06 --> 1659.66]  thoroughly
[1659.66 --> 1660.50]  equipped
[1660.50 --> 1662.12]  for every
[1662.12 --> 1662.76]  good work
[1662.76 --> 1663.40]  and thoroughly
[1663.40 --> 1664.28]  equipped means
[1664.28 --> 1665.30]  really mature
[1665.30 --> 1666.06]  complete
[1666.06 --> 1667.90]  as we said
[1667.90 --> 1668.34]  earlier
[1668.34 --> 1669.06]  some have
[1669.06 --> 1669.56]  described
[1669.56 --> 1671.94]  the result
[1671.94 --> 1672.72]  of spiritual
[1672.72 --> 1673.36]  disciplines
[1673.36 --> 1673.90]  is to be
[1673.90 --> 1674.48]  to do the
[1674.48 --> 1675.12]  right thing
[1675.12 --> 1675.48]  at the
[1675.48 --> 1676.26]  right time
[1676.26 --> 1676.62]  in the
[1676.62 --> 1677.26]  right way
[1677.26 --> 1678.16]  and in
[1678.16 --> 1678.58]  the right
[1678.58 --> 1679.14]  spirit
[1679.14 --> 1682.48]  and this
[1682.48 --> 1682.88]  is why
[1682.88 --> 1683.34]  we must
[1683.34 --> 1683.78]  read the
[1683.78 --> 1684.16]  Bible
[1684.16 --> 1687.12]  and let it
[1687.12 --> 1687.92]  penetrate
[1687.92 --> 1688.28]  it
[1688.28 --> 1690.20]  Elizabeth
[1690.20 --> 1690.66]  Haley
[1690.66 --> 1691.18]  Barton
[1691.18 --> 1691.96]  in her
[1691.96 --> 1692.22]  book
[1692.22 --> 1692.70]  Sacred
[1692.70 --> 1693.22]  Rhythms
[1693.22 --> 1695.62]  says the
[1695.62 --> 1696.28]  scriptures have
[1696.28 --> 1696.98]  been given to
[1696.98 --> 1697.90]  allow my own
[1697.90 --> 1699.32]  heart and soul
[1699.32 --> 1701.04]  to be penetrated
[1701.04 --> 1702.10]  by an intimate
[1702.10 --> 1703.34]  word from
[1703.34 --> 1703.74]  God
[1703.74 --> 1707.22]  we get into
[1707.22 --> 1707.78]  the word
[1707.78 --> 1709.30]  so it can get
[1709.30 --> 1710.02]  into us
[1710.02 --> 1712.70]  and quite
[1712.70 --> 1713.28]  frankly
[1713.28 --> 1714.66]  how you do
[1714.66 --> 1714.94]  it
[1714.94 --> 1716.88]  doesn't matter
[1716.88 --> 1717.80]  all that much
[1717.80 --> 1719.68]  that you do
[1719.68 --> 1719.96]  it
[1719.96 --> 1721.44]  doesn't matter
[1721.44 --> 1722.36]  how you exercise
[1722.36 --> 1723.88]  just exercise
[1723.88 --> 1725.22]  find a way
[1725.22 --> 1726.98]  it's like any
[1726.98 --> 1727.64]  relationship
[1727.64 --> 1728.96]  young men and
[1728.96 --> 1729.62]  women get pretty
[1729.62 --> 1730.38]  creative when they
[1730.38 --> 1731.00]  want to develop
[1731.00 --> 1731.58]  a relationship
[1731.58 --> 1732.98]  they find a way
[1732.98 --> 1733.72]  to get together
[1733.72 --> 1734.50]  and they learn
[1734.50 --> 1735.36]  how to communicate
[1735.36 --> 1736.82]  and it's no
[1736.82 --> 1737.38]  different with
[1737.38 --> 1737.76]  God
[1737.76 --> 1740.00]  simply pick a
[1740.00 --> 1740.56]  time
[1740.56 --> 1742.04]  and usually
[1742.04 --> 1743.04]  a place
[1743.04 --> 1744.70]  call it a
[1744.70 --> 1745.12]  date
[1745.12 --> 1748.12]  and then
[1748.12 --> 1749.92]  become
[1749.92 --> 1750.62]  disciplined
[1750.62 --> 1755.40]  if you're
[1755.40 --> 1755.80]  unfamiliar
[1755.80 --> 1756.36]  with the
[1756.36 --> 1756.68]  Bible
[1756.68 --> 1757.36]  you may want
[1757.36 --> 1757.74]  to start
[1757.74 --> 1758.06]  with the
[1758.06 --> 1758.64]  Gospel of
[1758.64 --> 1758.98]  John
[1758.98 --> 1759.26]  and you
[1759.26 --> 1759.46]  know
[1759.46 --> 1759.72]  one
[1759.72 --> 1760.72]  talked to
[1760.72 --> 1761.06]  Nicky
[1761.06 --> 1761.48]  Gumbel
[1761.48 --> 1762.64]  some of you
[1762.64 --> 1762.98]  may know
[1762.98 --> 1763.30]  of him
[1763.30 --> 1766.04]  he was a
[1766.04 --> 1766.36]  lawyer
[1766.36 --> 1767.18]  somebody
[1767.18 --> 1767.84]  challenged him
[1767.84 --> 1768.28]  when he sat
[1768.28 --> 1768.70]  down and
[1768.70 --> 1769.30]  started reading
[1769.30 --> 1769.72]  the Bible
[1769.72 --> 1770.30]  one night
[1770.30 --> 1772.50]  and you
[1772.50 --> 1772.84]  read the
[1772.84 --> 1773.08]  Bible
[1773.08 --> 1773.52]  like a
[1773.52 --> 1773.84]  novel
[1773.84 --> 1774.90]  just sit
[1774.90 --> 1775.10]  down
[1775.10 --> 1775.40]  and read
[1775.40 --> 1775.68]  one of
[1775.68 --> 1776.40]  the Gospels
[1776.40 --> 1777.36]  first time
[1777.36 --> 1777.66]  I did
[1777.66 --> 1777.84]  that
[1777.84 --> 1778.04]  I was
[1778.04 --> 1778.16]  in
[1778.16 --> 1778.68]  seminary
[1778.68 --> 1779.00]  I was
[1779.00 --> 1779.42]  supposed
[1779.42 --> 1780.04]  to be
[1780.04 --> 1780.56]  a student
[1780.56 --> 1781.40]  required
[1781.40 --> 1781.88]  reading
[1781.88 --> 1783.62]  what an
[1783.62 --> 1784.08]  impact
[1784.08 --> 1784.78]  reading
[1784.78 --> 1785.44]  the Gospel
[1785.44 --> 1786.32]  a Gospel
[1786.32 --> 1786.68]  through
[1786.68 --> 1787.28]  in one
[1787.28 --> 1787.74]  setting
[1787.74 --> 1788.40]  do it
[1788.40 --> 1788.60]  some
[1788.60 --> 1789.02]  evening
[1789.02 --> 1789.96]  it'll
[1789.96 --> 1790.46]  immerse
[1790.46 --> 1790.64]  you
[1790.64 --> 1790.90]  in the
[1790.90 --> 1791.14]  life
[1791.14 --> 1791.36]  of
[1791.36 --> 1791.90]  Jesus
[1791.90 --> 1792.84]  it's
[1792.84 --> 1793.04]  one
[1793.04 --> 1793.38]  way
[1793.38 --> 1795.06]  some
[1795.06 --> 1795.44]  follow
[1795.44 --> 1795.88]  Bible
[1795.88 --> 1796.20]  in a
[1796.20 --> 1796.48]  year
[1796.48 --> 1798.00]  some
[1798.00 --> 1798.32]  take
[1798.32 --> 1798.64]  very
[1798.64 --> 1799.18]  small
[1799.18 --> 1799.78]  amounts
[1799.78 --> 1801.82]  it's
[1801.82 --> 1802.30]  called
[1802.30 --> 1803.22]  Lectio
[1803.22 --> 1803.70]  Divina
[1803.70 --> 1804.42]  is a
[1804.42 --> 1804.72]  way
[1804.72 --> 1805.68]  it really
[1805.68 --> 1806.50]  means to
[1806.50 --> 1807.78]  meditate
[1807.78 --> 1810.70]  like a
[1810.70 --> 1812.82]  I read
[1812.82 --> 1813.92]  the analogy
[1813.92 --> 1815.06]  of a dog
[1815.06 --> 1815.64]  with a bone
[1815.64 --> 1816.62]  you ever see a dog
[1816.62 --> 1817.56]  finds a bone
[1817.56 --> 1819.18]  it's chewing
[1819.18 --> 1820.32]  it's absolutely
[1820.32 --> 1822.00]  you get into
[1822.00 --> 1822.78]  a passage
[1822.78 --> 1823.58]  of scripture
[1823.58 --> 1826.38]  you just chew
[1826.38 --> 1827.30]  away on it
[1827.30 --> 1829.52]  and you let
[1829.52 --> 1830.22]  it get into
[1830.22 --> 1830.54]  you
[1830.54 --> 1831.56]  and you say
[1831.56 --> 1831.88]  Lord
[1831.88 --> 1832.94]  what does this
[1832.94 --> 1833.28]  mean
[1833.28 --> 1833.82]  and you read
[1833.82 --> 1834.30]  it again
[1834.30 --> 1834.96]  how might you
[1834.96 --> 1835.52]  be speaking
[1835.52 --> 1836.34]  into my life
[1836.34 --> 1836.74]  and you read
[1836.74 --> 1837.04]  it again
[1837.04 --> 1837.30]  Lord
[1837.30 --> 1838.10]  what are you
[1838.10 --> 1838.80]  asking me
[1838.80 --> 1839.16]  to do
[1839.16 --> 1839.72]  this day
[1839.72 --> 1840.44]  out of this
[1840.44 --> 1840.88]  passage
[1840.88 --> 1841.42]  that's what
[1841.42 --> 1842.56]  Lectio Divina
[1842.56 --> 1843.06]  is really
[1843.06 --> 1843.56]  meant to
[1843.56 --> 1844.04]  help us
[1844.04 --> 1844.26]  do
[1844.26 --> 1844.70]  and if you
[1844.70 --> 1844.92]  want
[1844.92 --> 1845.34]  you google
[1845.34 --> 1845.58]  it
[1845.58 --> 1845.90]  and you'll
[1845.90 --> 1847.16]  find ways
[1847.16 --> 1848.14]  to meditate
[1848.14 --> 1849.30]  on a smaller
[1849.30 --> 1850.18]  passage of
[1850.18 --> 1850.36]  scripture
[1850.36 --> 1851.10]  there's all
[1851.10 --> 1851.74]  kinds of
[1851.74 --> 1852.14]  ways
[1852.14 --> 1853.84]  and listen
[1853.84 --> 1854.22]  to it
[1854.22 --> 1855.00]  on a CD
[1855.00 --> 1857.42]  and listen
[1857.42 --> 1857.76]  to it
[1857.76 --> 1858.12]  when you're
[1858.12 --> 1858.62]  traveling
[1858.62 --> 1860.12]  and listen
[1860.12 --> 1860.64]  to it
[1860.64 --> 1861.32]  quietly
[1861.32 --> 1861.96]  at night
[1861.96 --> 1863.08]  you can
[1863.08 --> 1863.64]  read it
[1863.64 --> 1865.70]  I think
[1865.70 --> 1866.22]  we've gotten
[1866.22 --> 1866.62]  away
[1866.62 --> 1867.00]  but we
[1867.00 --> 1867.40]  haven't
[1867.40 --> 1867.72]  in our
[1867.72 --> 1868.02]  house
[1868.02 --> 1868.52]  but we
[1868.52 --> 1868.84]  still
[1868.84 --> 1869.22]  read it
[1869.22 --> 1869.76]  at most
[1869.76 --> 1870.32]  supper
[1870.32 --> 1870.86]  times
[1870.86 --> 1871.52]  or meal
[1871.52 --> 1872.12]  times
[1872.12 --> 1872.98]  a passage
[1872.98 --> 1874.72]  we have
[1874.72 --> 1875.20]  our own
[1875.20 --> 1876.00]  ways
[1876.00 --> 1876.46]  of doing
[1876.46 --> 1876.74]  this
[1876.74 --> 1877.22]  my own
[1877.22 --> 1877.68]  personal
[1877.68 --> 1878.90]  discipline
[1878.90 --> 1879.28]  at this
[1879.28 --> 1879.66]  point
[1879.66 --> 1880.22]  in time
[1880.22 --> 1880.60]  is to
[1880.60 --> 1880.96]  read
[1880.96 --> 1881.78]  a minimum
[1881.78 --> 1882.32]  of two
[1882.32 --> 1882.96]  chapters
[1882.96 --> 1883.48]  old
[1883.48 --> 1883.94]  testament
[1883.94 --> 1884.42]  and new
[1884.42 --> 1884.72]  every
[1884.72 --> 1885.20]  morning
[1885.20 --> 1887.10]  it's
[1887.10 --> 1887.54]  amazing
[1887.54 --> 1887.80]  what
[1887.80 --> 1888.10]  comes
[1888.10 --> 1888.50]  up
[1888.50 --> 1890.64]  it's
[1890.64 --> 1890.84]  really
[1890.84 --> 1891.22]  how I
[1891.22 --> 1891.66]  came to
[1891.66 --> 1891.94]  faith
[1891.94 --> 1892.30]  I would
[1892.30 --> 1892.52]  say
[1892.52 --> 1892.82]  I was
[1892.82 --> 1893.32]  challenged
[1893.32 --> 1893.74]  as a
[1893.74 --> 1893.98]  kid
[1893.98 --> 1895.04]  by a
[1895.04 --> 1895.24]  fellow
[1895.24 --> 1895.48]  in
[1895.48 --> 1896.04]  Ontario
[1896.04 --> 1896.32]  in
[1896.32 --> 1896.62]  some
[1896.62 --> 1897.26]  magazine
[1897.26 --> 1897.58]  I think
[1897.58 --> 1897.92]  it was
[1897.92 --> 1898.68]  through
[1898.68 --> 1898.90]  the
[1898.90 --> 1899.86]  used to
[1899.86 --> 1900.24]  be called
[1900.24 --> 1900.58]  Uncle
[1900.58 --> 1900.90]  Bill
[1900.90 --> 1901.38]  and it
[1901.38 --> 1901.68]  was a
[1901.68 --> 1902.06]  challenge
[1902.06 --> 1902.48]  to read
[1902.48 --> 1902.64]  the
[1902.64 --> 1902.94]  Bible
[1902.94 --> 1903.24]  and if
[1903.24 --> 1903.48]  you did
[1903.48 --> 1903.60]  it
[1903.60 --> 1903.86]  for a
[1903.86 --> 1904.06]  year
[1904.06 --> 1904.22]  you
[1904.22 --> 1904.42]  got
[1904.42 --> 1904.58]  a
[1904.58 --> 1905.06]  certificate
[1905.06 --> 1906.56]  I
[1906.56 --> 1906.72]  did
[1906.72 --> 1906.84]  it
[1906.84 --> 1906.96]  for
[1906.96 --> 1907.32]  three
[1907.32 --> 1907.68]  years
[1907.68 --> 1908.04]  minus
[1908.04 --> 1908.42]  one
[1908.42 --> 1908.72]  night
[1908.72 --> 1908.92]  I
[1908.92 --> 1909.28]  remember
[1909.28 --> 1909.48]  the
[1909.48 --> 1909.66]  night
[1909.66 --> 1909.84]  we
[1909.84 --> 1910.00]  were
[1910.00 --> 1910.38]  camping
[1910.38 --> 1910.66]  up
[1910.66 --> 1910.86]  in
[1910.86 --> 1911.70]  Houston
[1911.70 --> 1911.98]  with
[1911.98 --> 1912.16]  my
[1912.16 --> 1912.46]  brother
[1912.46 --> 1912.86]  and a
[1912.86 --> 1913.20]  friend
[1913.20 --> 1914.26]  and I
[1914.26 --> 1914.52]  remember
[1914.52 --> 1914.86]  it was
[1914.86 --> 1915.16]  late
[1915.16 --> 1915.36]  and I
[1915.36 --> 1915.56]  suddenly
[1915.56 --> 1915.92]  oh
[1915.92 --> 1916.62]  crap
[1916.62 --> 1916.78]  I
[1916.78 --> 1917.04]  didn't
[1917.04 --> 1917.28]  read
[1917.28 --> 1917.42]  the
[1917.42 --> 1917.66]  Bible
[1917.66 --> 1918.02]  today
[1918.02 --> 1918.70]  well you
[1918.70 --> 1919.08]  can get
[1919.08 --> 1919.42]  a little
[1919.42 --> 1920.20]  hypocritical
[1920.20 --> 1920.60]  and self
[1920.60 --> 1920.94]  righteous
[1920.94 --> 1921.52]  about all
[1921.52 --> 1921.68]  that
[1921.68 --> 1922.02]  but you
[1922.02 --> 1922.14]  know
[1922.14 --> 1922.34]  the
[1922.34 --> 1922.84]  discipline
[1922.84 --> 1923.34]  of doing
[1923.34 --> 1923.54]  it
[1923.54 --> 1923.88]  for
[1923.88 --> 1924.24]  three
[1924.24 --> 1924.56]  years
[1924.56 --> 1925.02]  changed
[1925.02 --> 1925.24]  my
[1925.24 --> 1925.66]  life
[1925.66 --> 1928.28]  doesn't
[1928.28 --> 1928.60]  have to
[1928.60 --> 1928.74]  be
[1928.74 --> 1929.12]  much
[1929.12 --> 1931.78]  in
[1931.78 --> 1931.96]  the
[1931.96 --> 1932.46]  end
[1932.46 --> 1932.94]  what we
[1932.94 --> 1933.18]  need
[1933.18 --> 1933.34]  to
[1933.34 --> 1933.88]  become
[1933.88 --> 1934.52]  is
[1934.52 --> 1935.38]  individuals
[1935.38 --> 1936.62]  who
[1936.62 --> 1936.88]  have a
[1936.88 --> 1937.32]  passion
[1937.32 --> 1937.62]  for
[1937.62 --> 1938.08]  Christ
[1938.08 --> 1938.42]  and we
[1938.42 --> 1938.82]  want to
[1938.82 --> 1939.00]  know
[1939.00 --> 1939.38]  more
[1939.38 --> 1940.22]  and we
[1940.22 --> 1940.54]  must
[1940.54 --> 1940.98]  become
[1940.98 --> 1941.36]  what we
[1941.36 --> 1941.54]  could
[1941.54 --> 1941.94]  call
[1941.94 --> 1942.94]  self
[1942.94 --> 1944.44]  feeders
[1944.44 --> 1947.70]  and I
[1947.70 --> 1948.00]  think this
[1948.00 --> 1948.52]  is appropriate
[1948.52 --> 1949.04]  in days
[1949.04 --> 1949.58]  of COVID
[1949.58 --> 1950.68]  self
[1950.68 --> 1951.16]  feeders
[1951.16 --> 1951.62]  who are
[1951.62 --> 1952.00]  not
[1952.00 --> 1952.82]  reliant
[1952.82 --> 1953.32]  on the
[1953.32 --> 1953.60]  church
[1953.60 --> 1953.84]  I'm
[1953.84 --> 1954.08]  actually
[1954.08 --> 1954.40]  quite
[1954.40 --> 1954.86]  concerned
[1954.86 --> 1956.20]  I'm
[1956.20 --> 1956.44]  seeing
[1956.44 --> 1956.78]  people
[1956.78 --> 1957.00]  I
[1957.00 --> 1957.22]  think
[1957.22 --> 1957.78]  kind
[1957.78 --> 1957.88]  of
[1957.88 --> 1958.18]  happy
[1958.18 --> 1958.40]  they
[1958.40 --> 1958.58]  can
[1958.58 --> 1958.80]  take
[1958.80 --> 1959.18]  distance
[1959.18 --> 1959.40]  with
[1959.40 --> 1959.56]  the
[1959.56 --> 1959.78]  church
[1959.78 --> 1959.96]  and
[1959.96 --> 1960.14]  I'm
[1960.14 --> 1960.56]  wondering
[1960.56 --> 1960.84]  whether
[1960.84 --> 1961.12]  that
[1961.12 --> 1961.44]  means
[1961.44 --> 1962.02]  they
[1962.02 --> 1962.40]  think
[1962.40 --> 1962.60]  they
[1962.60 --> 1962.82]  can
[1962.82 --> 1963.08]  take
[1963.08 --> 1963.50]  distance
[1963.50 --> 1963.76]  from
[1963.76 --> 1963.98]  the
[1963.98 --> 1964.34]  Lord
[1964.34 --> 1969.38]  because
[1969.38 --> 1969.88]  if our
[1969.88 --> 1970.24]  faith
[1970.24 --> 1970.44]  is
[1970.44 --> 1971.02]  reliant
[1971.02 --> 1971.36]  on the
[1971.36 --> 1971.66]  church
[1971.66 --> 1972.38]  community
[1972.38 --> 1973.82]  then we're
[1973.82 --> 1974.02]  going to
[1974.02 --> 1974.30]  be a
[1974.30 --> 1974.62]  drag
[1974.62 --> 1975.28]  on it
[1975.28 --> 1976.36]  doesn't
[1976.36 --> 1976.66]  mean we
[1976.66 --> 1976.90]  shouldn't
[1976.90 --> 1977.14]  be in
[1977.14 --> 1977.62]  community
[1977.62 --> 1978.92]  but if
[1978.92 --> 1979.34]  we aren't
[1979.34 --> 1979.74]  self
[1979.74 --> 1980.26]  feeders
[1980.26 --> 1980.60]  who know
[1980.60 --> 1980.92]  how to
[1980.92 --> 1981.36]  care for
[1981.36 --> 1981.72]  our own
[1981.72 --> 1982.02]  soul
[1982.02 --> 1982.32]  they used
[1982.32 --> 1982.64]  to say
[1982.64 --> 1983.26]  this to
[1983.26 --> 1983.74]  people in
[1983.74 --> 1984.20]  profession
[1984.20 --> 1984.68]  of faith
[1984.68 --> 1985.14]  class
[1985.14 --> 1985.82]  are you
[1985.82 --> 1986.28]  the kind
[1986.28 --> 1986.74]  of person
[1986.74 --> 1987.04]  who if
[1987.04 --> 1987.32]  you get
[1987.32 --> 1987.84]  stranded
[1987.84 --> 1988.28]  on an
[1988.28 --> 1988.50]  island
[1988.50 --> 1989.00]  someday
[1989.00 --> 1989.64]  and there's
[1989.64 --> 1990.12]  only four
[1990.12 --> 1990.62]  other people
[1990.62 --> 1990.84]  and they're
[1990.84 --> 1991.42]  not believers
[1991.42 --> 1992.00]  you're
[1992.00 --> 1992.24]  going to
[1992.24 --> 1992.68]  hold on
[1992.68 --> 1992.98]  to who
[1992.98 --> 1993.34]  Jesus
[1993.34 --> 1993.66]  is
[1993.66 --> 1994.16]  because
[1994.16 --> 1994.50]  you've
[1994.50 --> 1994.94]  embedded
[1994.94 --> 1995.20]  him
[1995.20 --> 1995.58]  or he's
[1995.58 --> 1995.92]  gotten
[1995.92 --> 1996.44]  embedded
[1996.44 --> 1997.20]  into your
[1997.20 --> 1997.80]  soul
[1997.80 --> 1999.12]  and your
[1999.12 --> 1999.90]  mind
[1999.90 --> 2002.48]  these are
[2002.48 --> 2003.06]  the people
[2003.06 --> 2003.90]  we need
[2003.90 --> 2004.36]  to be
[2004.36 --> 2005.18]  and then
[2005.18 --> 2005.64]  we come
[2005.64 --> 2006.08]  together
[2006.08 --> 2006.70]  as church
[2006.70 --> 2007.28]  and we're
[2007.28 --> 2007.92]  strong
[2007.92 --> 2011.68]  a grown
[2011.68 --> 2012.38]  up child
[2012.38 --> 2013.32]  isn't reliant
[2013.32 --> 2013.88]  on mother
[2013.88 --> 2014.40]  anymore
[2014.40 --> 2015.58]  to be fed
[2015.58 --> 2016.60]  and the
[2016.60 --> 2017.16]  church is
[2017.16 --> 2017.48]  in the
[2017.48 --> 2017.82]  scriptures
[2017.82 --> 2018.40]  called
[2018.40 --> 2019.40]  the mother
[2019.40 --> 2020.38]  we find
[2020.38 --> 2021.02]  ways
[2021.02 --> 2021.52]  to feed
[2021.52 --> 2021.74]  our
[2021.74 --> 2022.26]  soul
[2022.26 --> 2023.36]  and then
[2023.36 --> 2023.76]  we love
[2023.76 --> 2024.58]  coming home
[2024.58 --> 2025.08]  to mother
[2025.08 --> 2025.44]  and the
[2025.44 --> 2025.82]  family
[2025.82 --> 2026.50]  where together
[2026.50 --> 2027.44]  we feast
[2027.44 --> 2030.58]  but in the
[2030.58 --> 2030.86]  end
[2030.86 --> 2031.34]  what we're
[2031.34 --> 2031.80]  meant to
[2031.80 --> 2032.12]  do
[2032.12 --> 2033.18]  is to
[2033.18 --> 2033.74]  find a
[2033.74 --> 2034.06]  way
[2034.06 --> 2034.92]  to relate
[2034.92 --> 2036.60]  very deeply
[2036.60 --> 2037.44]  and intimately
[2037.44 --> 2038.34]  to Christ
[2038.34 --> 2040.68]  so that
[2040.68 --> 2041.02]  in the
[2041.02 --> 2041.38]  end
[2041.38 --> 2042.88]  we know
[2042.88 --> 2043.22]  what it
[2043.22 --> 2043.52]  is to
[2043.52 --> 2044.20]  be saved
[2044.20 --> 2045.32]  because we
[2045.32 --> 2045.70]  know what
[2045.70 --> 2046.16]  it is
[2046.16 --> 2047.18]  we're
[2047.18 --> 2047.52]  sinners
[2047.52 --> 2048.98]  and we
[2048.98 --> 2049.90]  find ways
[2049.90 --> 2050.56]  to follow
[2050.56 --> 2050.86]  our
[2050.86 --> 2051.20]  Savior
[2051.20 --> 2052.40]  and to
[2052.40 --> 2052.98]  truly
[2052.98 --> 2054.10]  live
[2054.10 --> 2055.94]  pray with

[2056.12 --> 2056.40]  God

[2056.94 --> 2057.24]  you've

[2058.26 --> 2060.16]  and
[2060.16 --> 2061.24]  we haven't
[2061.24 --> 2061.76]  talked about
[2061.76 --> 2062.50]  your creation
[2062.50 --> 2063.00]  but it's
[2063.00 --> 2063.58]  out there
[2063.58 --> 2063.98]  just

[2072.28 --> 2072.94]  to read
[2072.94 --> 2075.58]  you've spoken

[2079.98 --> 2080.34]  writers
[2080.34 --> 2081.10]  of your

[2087.40 --> 2088.32]  to this
[2088.32 --> 2089.24]  your living
[2089.24 --> 2089.74]  word
[2089.74 --> 2091.20]  but especially
[2091.20 --> 2092.28]  in the end
[2092.28 --> 2092.94]  help us to

[2094.82 --> 2095.22]  are
[2095.22 --> 2096.20]  so that we
[2096.20 --> 2097.04]  submit to
[2097.04 --> 2097.38]  you
