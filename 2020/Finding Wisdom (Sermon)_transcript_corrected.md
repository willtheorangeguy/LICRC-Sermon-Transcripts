[0.00 → 8.68] The reading this morning is from Job, chapter 28, the book of Job.
[9.62 → 11.82] The theme is finding wisdom.
[15.52 → 22.32] Job 28 is divided into three stanzas, so I will indicate when each one begins.
[23.22 → 29.00] Stanza 1, there is a mine for silver and a place where gold is refined.
[30.00 → 33.78] Iron is taken from the earth and copper is smelted from ore.
[34.68 → 37.14] Mortals put an end to the darkness.
[37.46 → 42.34] They search out the farthest recesses for ore in the blackest darkness.
[43.26 → 48.96] Far from human dwellings they cut a shaft in places untouched by human feet.
[49.16 → 52.56] Far from other people they dangle and sway.
[53.50 → 57.92] The earth from which food comes is transformed below as by fire.
[57.92 → 63.86] Laps lazuli comes from its rocks and its dust contains nuggets of gold.
[64.72 → 67.38] No bird of prey knows that hidden path.
[67.54 → 69.48] No falcon's eye has seen it.
[70.06 → 72.50] Proud beasts do not set foot on it.
[72.86 → 74.58] And no lion prowls there.
[74.58 → 78.98] People assault the flinty rock with their hands.
[78.98 → 81.98] Lay bare the roots of the mountains.
[82.18 → 84.22] They tunnel through the rock.
[84.76 → 86.82] Their eyes see all its treasures.
[87.68 → 92.14] They search the sources of the rivers and bring hidden things to light.
[92.14 → 96.16] But where can wisdom be found?
[97.10 → 99.80] Where does understanding dwell?
[99.80 → 103.40] Well, then begins stanza two.
[104.60 → 107.58] No mortal comprehends its worth.
[108.28 → 110.82] It cannot be found in the land of the living.
[111.24 → 113.64] The deep says it is not in me.
[114.00 → 116.78] The sea says it is not in me.
[117.34 → 120.08] It cannot be bought with the finest gold,
[120.08 → 123.30] nor can its price be weighed out in silver.
[124.04 → 126.74] It cannot be bought with the gold of Ophir,
[127.18 → 129.64] with precious onyx or laps lazuli.
[130.64 → 133.66] Neither gold nor crystal can compare with it,
[134.20 → 136.96] nor can it be had for jewels of gold.
[137.70 → 140.26] Coral and jasper are not worthy of mention.
[140.82 → 144.24] The price of wisdom is beyond rubies.
[144.24 → 147.76] The topaz of chose cannot compare with it.
[148.38 → 150.68] It cannot be bought with pure gold.
[152.18 → 155.14] Where, then, does wisdom come from?
[155.86 → 158.32] Where does understanding dwell?
[160.44 → 162.24] Now begin stanza three.
[163.28 → 166.20] It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing,
[166.44 → 168.80] concealed even from the birds in the sky.
[169.42 → 173.76] Destruction and death say only a rumour of it has reached our ears.
[174.70 → 177.32] God understands the way to it,
[178.02 → 181.08] and he alone knows where it dwells.
[181.48 → 183.74] For he views the ends of the earth
[183.74 → 185.78] and sees everything under the heavens.
[186.40 → 189.16] When he established the force of the wind
[189.16 → 190.72] and measured out the waters,
[191.20 → 193.38] when he made the decree for rain
[193.38 → 195.06] and the path for the thunderstorm,
[195.74 → 198.64] then he looked at wisdom and appraised it.
[198.64 → 201.18] He confirmed it and tested it,
[201.50 → 203.54] and he said to the human race,
[203.54 → 206.08] the fear of the Lord,
[206.78 → 208.00] that is wisdom,
[208.82 → 211.54] and to shun evil is understanding.
[212.74 → 214.84] And that's our text for this morning, too,
[214.92 → 216.48] the fear of the Lord,
[216.62 → 219.62] and that we can just as well say,
[219.76 → 223.00] the love for the Lord,
[223.38 → 224.72] that is wisdom,
[224.72 → 228.02] and to shun evil is understanding.
[228.02 → 229.90] Brothers and sisters,
[229.90 → 231.40] in our Lord Jesus Christ,
[232.34 → 233.26] why?
[234.58 → 237.46] That's a question kids love to ask, isn't it?
[238.14 → 239.90] And we as parents, you know,
[239.94 → 241.78] we have to have a lot of wisdom
[241.78 → 243.74] to always answer that question.
[244.50 → 245.98] I was struck by that once
[245.98 → 248.04] when I was volunteering
[248.04 → 250.12] at Abbotsford Regional Hospital,
[250.26 → 252.78] as I used to do every Thursday morning
[252.78 → 255.74] before the pandemic shut us down.
[256.58 → 260.16] I was a pastoral visitor there at the hospital,
[260.16 → 262.64] and every week I would spend an hour
[262.64 → 264.08] in the psych ward
[264.08 → 267.16] and working with the patients there
[267.16 → 270.14] and just to be there to talk to them,
[270.24 → 271.80] to answer their questions or whatever.
[271.80 → 275.18] So one week the physiotherapist on Judy
[275.18 → 277.10] introduced me as Pastor Rudy
[277.10 → 278.42] and added,
[278.78 → 281.00] he can answer any of your questions.
[281.72 → 283.82] Well, that kind of left it wide open.
[284.02 → 285.96] So one of the patients there,
[286.32 → 290.24] in fact, a lady that I had spoken with before,
[290.64 → 292.70] so she knew who I was and so on,
[292.78 → 294.06] a little bit,
[294.14 → 297.36] but she thought she'd tease me a little bit
[297.36 → 300.58] and make a joke by asking me,
[300.58 → 302.84] well, if you can answer any of our questions,
[302.96 → 304.36] why is the sky blue?
[305.80 → 307.94] Isn't that the kind of question kids usually ask?
[308.02 → 309.08] Why is the sky blue?
[309.74 → 311.04] Well, I told her,
[311.10 → 312.70] turning the joke back on her,
[313.06 → 314.28] it just so happens that
[314.28 → 315.64] before I became a pastor,
[315.78 → 316.96] I was a science teacher,
[317.36 → 318.66] and I can tell you exactly
[318.66 → 319.84] why the sky is blue.
[320.38 → 322.18] So we had kind of fun with that.
[323.06 → 324.32] But I can imagine that
[324.32 → 327.38] the answers aren't always so ready to hand
[327.38 → 329.42] when kids come up with these questions.
[329.58 → 329.96] Why?
[330.58 → 331.04] Why?
[331.20 → 332.82] And parents need a lot of wisdom.
[333.64 → 335.52] Where do parents get the wisdom
[335.52 → 337.84] to answer all these questions?
[338.70 → 339.98] The story of Job
[339.98 → 342.10] is a search for wisdom
[342.10 → 345.70] in facing the many struggles of life.
[346.32 → 348.34] Job was a suffering child of God
[348.34 → 350.06] who wanted to know why.
[350.06 → 355.74] Three friends came to offer words of wisdom to Job.
[356.94 → 358.76] Elisha, Ballad, and Zohar.
[358.96 → 360.44] If you're familiar with the story,
[361.28 → 362.98] you've read the book,
[363.28 → 365.30] you know all their arguments.
[365.44 → 367.28] We're not going to get into those this morning,
[367.28 → 369.90] but did you ever notice that
[369.90 → 372.84] before they began to argue with him,
[372.84 → 378.12] they sat with him in silence for a week.
[378.12 → 383.06] 168 hours of sitting with him
[383.06 → 385.16] and not saying anything.
[385.16 → 387.60] Now that showed real wisdom.
[388.70 → 390.32] That is real comfort.
[390.52 → 391.54] You know, sometimes when,
[391.74 → 393.64] and you and I have experienced that
[393.64 → 395.44] when we go through difficult times,
[395.44 → 397.80] we don't need people to come
[397.80 → 399.32] and give us the answer
[399.32 → 401.60] and tell us how we should feel
[401.60 → 403.18] and what we should do.
[403.38 → 405.70] We just need somebody to be there.
[407.64 → 409.06] Just to be there.
[409.20 → 412.40] 90%, they say, of caring is just showing up.
[413.04 → 415.02] Just to be there and sit with them.
[415.82 → 416.82] 168 hours.
[417.64 → 419.00] Can you imagine that?
[419.08 → 420.70] And then they begin this debate.
[421.16 → 424.30] Now, depending on how fast a reader you are,
[424.30 → 425.84] you know, you can sit down
[425.84 → 427.34] and read that whole debate,
[427.54 → 431.66] chapters 3 through 27,
[432.26 → 433.16] and you can read that
[433.16 → 435.34] in about an hour and a half to two hours.
[436.72 → 438.68] So all the good that they did
[438.68 → 441.30] in the 168 hours of sitting there
[441.30 → 442.22] and being with him,
[442.52 → 443.60] they kind of undid it
[443.60 → 444.70] when they opened their mouth
[444.70 → 445.86] and started to talk
[445.86 → 448.14] and give all kinds of excuses
[448.14 → 449.92] and reasons and so on.
[450.24 → 452.04] The first round of speeches
[452.04 → 454.86] that takes about two hours to read,
[455.20 → 457.68] and that's chapters 1 through 27.
[458.62 → 461.44] And then chapters 29 through 42
[461.44 → 463.62] gives a second round of speeches
[463.62 → 464.52] from Job,
[465.48 → 466.96] a newcomer to the group,
[467.08 → 467.72] Elite,
[467.98 → 470.58] and then God giving his answer.
[471.38 → 472.46] And chapter 28
[472.46 → 473.86] is right in between
[473.86 → 476.12] those two rounds of speeches.
[476.28 → 477.42] It's an interlude.
[477.42 → 479.24] And in this interlude,
[479.38 → 480.64] the question is asked,
[481.14 → 483.76] where can wisdom be found?
[484.66 → 486.50] And it's set up like a poem
[486.50 → 489.44] with the refrain after each verse.
[489.92 → 491.86] The refrain in verse 12,
[492.70 → 494.94] where does wisdom come from?
[495.08 → 496.68] Where does understanding dwell?
[497.44 → 498.70] And in verse 20,
[498.80 → 499.66] that is repeated.
[500.36 → 501.38] And in our text,
[501.50 → 502.18] verse 28,
[502.30 → 503.68] it's changed a little bit.
[503.78 → 504.76] The answer is given.
[504.76 → 505.94] And the fear of the Lord,
[506.34 → 507.44] that is wisdom.
[507.92 → 509.92] And to shun evil is understanding.
[510.10 → 511.00] So each stanza
[511.00 → 515.44] ends with a question about wisdom.
[516.58 → 518.42] Now, in the first stanza,
[518.70 → 521.60] Job considers mankind's search
[521.60 → 523.36] for wisdom.
[524.50 → 526.74] Where can we find wisdom
[526.74 → 528.10] if we seek for it?
[529.04 → 530.00] In the second stanza,
[530.12 → 532.50] he considers mankind's wealth.
[532.50 → 535.30] Can we buy wisdom
[535.30 → 536.74] if we are rich enough
[536.74 → 538.28] to buy it?
[538.96 → 539.60] And finally,
[539.80 → 540.82] he turns to God
[540.82 → 541.80] in the third stanza
[541.80 → 543.88] to discover the true source
[543.88 → 545.10] of wisdom,
[545.34 → 546.44] which is God himself.
[546.68 → 548.34] Let's look at these two stanzas.
[548.94 → 549.60] The first one,
[549.74 → 551.32] mankind's search.
[553.14 → 554.40] Verses 1 to 11
[554.40 → 555.72] give us a detailed
[555.72 → 557.36] and accurate description
[557.36 → 559.50] of ancient mining methods.
[559.50 → 562.08] The author's intention
[562.08 → 564.10] is to reflect mankind's
[564.10 → 565.42] amazing skill
[565.42 → 566.30] and cunning
[566.30 → 567.74] in carrying out
[567.74 → 569.20] this extremely difficult
[569.20 → 571.02] and hazardous task
[571.02 → 573.80] of getting valuable minerals
[573.80 → 575.06] and gems and so on
[575.06 → 577.02] from underneath the earth.
[577.70 → 578.74] Mankind's success
[578.74 → 579.70] as a miner
[579.70 → 581.52] shows how resourceful
[581.52 → 583.98] and how intelligent we are.
[583.98 → 585.68] We have conquered
[585.68 → 586.54] the creation
[586.54 → 588.28] in a real sense
[588.28 → 589.34] and we use it
[589.34 → 590.58] for our own purposes.
[591.62 → 592.46] We have discovered
[592.46 → 593.58] many things,
[593.74 → 595.40] he says in this stanza,
[595.86 → 597.30] underneath the earth
[597.30 → 598.26] that even
[598.26 → 600.10] mighty creatures
[600.10 → 601.34] who roam the earth
[601.34 → 602.46] and fly over it
[602.46 → 603.62] have never seen.
[604.92 → 605.54] Mankind
[605.54 → 608.00] is the crown of creation.
[608.72 → 609.64] We can discover
[609.64 → 611.42] the sources of rivers.
[611.42 → 613.44] We can lay bare
[613.44 → 615.02] the roots of the mountains
[615.02 → 616.62] and bring hidden things
[616.62 → 617.28] to light.
[618.18 → 619.34] But for all
[619.34 → 620.62] of our skill
[620.62 → 621.38] and ability
[621.38 → 623.38] we cannot discover
[623.38 → 624.52] the mystery
[624.52 → 625.82] of wisdom.
[626.58 → 627.88] Nor are we able
[627.88 → 628.88] to search out
[628.88 → 629.62] and understand
[629.62 → 630.94] the secret ways
[630.94 → 631.66] of God.
[632.76 → 633.42] These verses
[633.42 → 634.16] suggest
[634.16 → 635.08] the difficulty
[635.08 → 635.80] facing us
[635.80 → 636.38] in our search
[636.38 → 636.92] for wisdom.
[638.00 → 639.36] We will not find it
[639.36 → 641.36] by our own efforts.
[641.42 → 642.42] and abilities
[642.42 → 643.72] and therefore
[643.72 → 645.16] the refrain cries out
[645.16 → 646.64] where can wisdom
[646.64 → 647.36] be found?
[648.18 → 648.82] Where does
[648.82 → 650.00] understanding dwell?
[651.80 → 652.74] Then we come
[652.74 → 653.86] to the second stanza
[653.86 → 654.44] and there
[654.44 → 655.60] we look at
[655.60 → 657.10] mankind's wealth.
[659.18 → 659.86] Perhaps you've
[659.86 → 660.44] heard the slogan
[660.44 → 661.98] when money talks
[661.98 → 662.86] people listen
[662.86 → 664.76] and that's often true.
[665.74 → 666.10] Or
[666.10 → 667.82] the golden rule
[667.82 → 668.56] you might have heard
[668.56 → 669.16] has been twisted
[669.16 → 669.58] to say
[669.58 → 670.06] he who
[670.06 → 671.72] has the gold
[671.72 → 672.46] rules.
[674.10 → 675.22] Money talks
[675.22 → 675.68] indeed
[675.68 → 676.62] but is that
[676.62 → 678.08] where wisdom lies?
[678.88 → 679.74] Does wealth
[679.74 → 681.30] bring wisdom?
[681.78 → 682.46] Can money
[682.46 → 683.70] buy it?
[684.58 → 685.32] In verse 13
[685.32 → 685.94] we read
[685.94 → 687.32] no mortal
[687.32 → 688.50] can comprehend
[688.50 → 690.26] its worth.
[690.96 → 692.10] We don't even know
[692.10 → 693.16] the true value
[693.16 → 694.34] of wisdom.
[694.34 → 695.80] how could we
[695.80 → 696.62] even begin
[696.62 → 697.92] to buy it?
[698.58 → 698.84] And then
[698.84 → 699.74] verse 13b
[699.74 → 700.72] and 14 say
[700.72 → 702.56] even if you knew
[702.56 → 703.28] its value
[703.28 → 704.34] where would you go
[704.34 → 705.60] to buy it?
[706.34 → 707.54] You can't find it
[707.54 → 708.30] any place
[708.30 → 709.32] in the land
[709.32 → 710.08] of the living.
[711.34 → 712.64] Even the deep
[712.64 → 713.80] and the sea
[713.80 → 714.54] say
[714.54 → 715.52] it is not
[715.52 → 716.24] with me.
[717.30 → 717.34] Creation
[717.90 → 718.72] itself
[718.72 → 720.18] can't sell it
[720.18 → 721.20] to us.
[721.20 → 723.42] verse 15
[723.42 → 724.12] to 19
[724.12 → 724.86] show that
[724.86 → 725.38] if you could
[725.38 → 725.86] find
[725.86 → 727.00] all the most
[727.00 → 728.40] precious jewels
[728.40 → 729.34] on earth
[729.34 → 730.78] you still
[730.78 → 731.34] could not
[731.34 → 732.20] buy wisdom.
[733.48 → 733.76] And so
[733.76 → 734.22] again
[734.22 → 735.16] the refrain
[735.16 → 736.16] of verse 20
[736.16 → 736.70] asks
[736.70 → 738.04] where does
[738.04 → 738.64] wisdom
[738.64 → 740.12] come from?
[740.82 → 741.40] Where does
[741.40 → 742.20] understanding
[742.20 → 743.24] dwell?
[744.66 → 745.40] Now we look
[745.40 → 745.90] at the third
[745.90 → 746.38] stanza
[746.38 → 747.60] discovering
[747.60 → 748.56] God's
[748.56 → 749.34] response.
[749.34 → 751.44] verses 21
[751.44 → 752.28] to 27
[752.28 → 754.12] it is time
[754.12 → 754.78] to turn away
[754.78 → 755.54] from man
[755.54 → 757.02] and to seek
[757.02 → 757.66] the answer
[757.66 → 758.50] from God.
[759.58 → 760.76] Verse 21
[760.76 → 761.54] begins by
[761.54 → 762.54] repeating
[762.54 → 763.30] the ideas
[763.30 → 763.68] that
[763.68 → 764.78] though we may
[764.78 → 765.54] search for
[765.54 → 766.22] hidden treasures
[766.22 → 767.04] in the earth
[767.04 → 767.92] though we may
[767.92 → 768.58] see more
[768.58 → 769.32] aspects of
[769.32 → 769.84] creation
[769.84 → 770.50] than any
[770.50 → 771.30] other creature
[771.30 → 772.38] though skill
[772.38 → 773.52] and ingenuity
[773.52 → 774.24] may open
[774.24 → 775.36] many mysteries
[775.36 → 776.28] of creation
[776.28 → 777.72] yet for all
[777.72 → 778.48] our searching
[778.48 → 779.22] we cannot
[779.22 → 780.78] find wisdom
[780.78 → 781.72] for all
[781.72 → 782.34] the amassed
[782.34 → 782.78] riches
[782.78 → 783.66] of our world
[783.66 → 784.58] we cannot
[784.58 → 785.40] buy it.
[787.14 → 788.02] Does that
[788.02 → 788.46] mean that
[788.46 → 789.10] God's wisdom
[789.10 → 790.04] is not present
[790.04 → 791.16] in this
[791.16 → 791.64] creation?
[792.84 → 793.96] Well we
[793.96 → 795.00] as New Testament
[795.00 → 795.48] Christians
[795.48 → 796.02] know that
[796.02 → 796.50] that's not
[796.50 → 797.22] true because
[797.22 → 797.76] we know
[797.76 → 798.38] the Apostle
[798.38 → 799.16] Paul teaches
[799.16 → 799.90] us differently.
[800.98 → 801.74] In Romans 1
[801.74 → 802.44] verse 19
[802.44 → 803.04] and 20
[803.04 → 804.70] he writes
[804.70 → 805.70] what may
[805.70 → 806.46] be known
[806.46 → 807.54] about God
[807.54 → 808.28] is plain
[808.28 → 808.76] to them
[808.76 → 809.66] because God
[809.66 → 810.28] has made
[810.28 → 810.76] it plain
[810.76 → 811.24] to them
[811.24 → 811.86] for since
[811.86 → 812.60] the creation
[812.60 → 813.32] of the world
[813.32 → 814.90] God's invisible
[814.90 → 815.64] qualities
[815.64 → 816.56] his eternal
[816.56 → 817.22] power
[817.22 → 817.96] and divine
[817.96 → 818.36] nature
[818.36 → 819.14] have been
[819.14 → 820.66] clearly seen
[820.66 → 822.16] being understood
[822.16 → 822.96] from what
[822.96 → 824.00] has been made
[824.00 → 825.16] so that men
[825.16 → 826.06] are without
[826.06 → 826.90] excuse.
[827.90 → 828.22] And from
[828.22 → 828.98] that we learn
[828.98 → 829.68] that yes
[829.68 → 830.70] the wisdom
[830.70 → 831.34] of God
[831.34 → 832.98] is present
[832.98 → 834.48] in creation
[834.48 → 836.00] but we can
[836.00 → 837.16] only see it
[837.16 → 838.34] if God
[838.34 → 839.56] reveals it
[839.56 → 840.30] to us.
[841.74 → 842.70] Job 38
[842.70 → 843.66] through 40
[843.66 → 844.86] is what
[844.86 → 845.24] we might
[845.24 → 845.84] almost call
[845.84 → 846.70] a tour
[846.70 → 847.98] of the universe
[847.98 → 849.76] where God
[849.76 → 850.76] now speaks
[850.76 → 852.66] and God
[852.66 → 853.12] says
[853.12 → 854.00] where were
[854.00 → 855.20] you Job
[855.20 → 856.34] with all
[856.34 → 856.96] your wisdom
[856.96 → 858.14] when I
[858.14 → 858.70] created
[858.70 → 859.66] the universe
[859.66 → 861.56] how can
[861.56 → 862.50] you understand
[862.50 → 862.86] Job
[862.86 → 863.62] how it
[863.62 → 864.14] was made
[864.14 → 865.00] and how
[865.00 → 865.56] it was put
[865.56 → 866.02] together
[866.02 → 868.58] can mankind
[868.58 → 869.74] can we
[869.74 → 871.26] ever grasp
[871.26 → 872.28] the miracle
[872.28 → 873.58] of what God
[873.58 → 874.12] did
[874.12 → 875.48] in the creation
[875.48 → 876.46] and what he
[876.46 → 877.50] continues to
[877.50 → 878.00] do
[878.00 → 879.82] in upholding
[879.82 → 880.52] and sustaining
[880.52 → 881.22] and providing
[881.22 → 882.12] for our world
[882.12 → 884.12] the wisdom
[884.12 → 884.88] of God
[884.88 → 885.68] is indeed
[885.68 → 886.54] present
[886.54 → 887.70] in creation
[887.70 → 889.34] but only
[889.34 → 890.14] God
[890.14 → 891.66] knows
[891.66 → 892.06] the way
[892.06 → 892.58] to it
[892.58 → 893.86] he is
[893.86 → 894.58] the source
[894.58 → 895.92] and only
[895.92 → 896.66] he can
[896.66 → 897.02] give it
[897.02 → 897.56] to us
[897.56 → 899.42] how then
[899.42 → 899.92] can we
[899.92 → 900.86] get wisdom
[900.86 → 901.92] well
[901.92 → 903.42] that's why
[903.42 → 904.12] verse 28
[904.12 → 905.06] is our text
[905.06 → 905.98] and also
[905.98 → 906.68] the conclusion
[906.68 → 907.54] of this chapter
[907.54 → 909.48] verse 28
[909.48 → 910.56] reveals God's
[910.56 → 911.38] secret way
[911.38 → 912.88] the fear
[912.88 → 914.64] or the love
[914.64 → 915.74] of the Lord
[915.74 → 916.76] is the beginning
[916.76 → 917.34] of wisdom
[917.34 → 919.12] and those
[919.12 → 919.70] are familiar
[919.70 → 920.18] words
[920.18 → 920.68] I know
[920.68 → 921.00] they are
[921.00 → 921.34] for me
[921.34 → 921.80] because they
[921.80 → 922.16] were written
[922.16 → 922.96] on the foundation
[922.96 → 923.70] stone of the
[923.70 → 924.36] Christian school
[924.36 → 925.12] that I attended
[925.12 → 926.14] in Hamilton
[926.14 → 926.78] Ontario
[926.78 → 928.78] the fear
[928.78 → 929.26] of the Lord
[929.26 → 929.88] is the beginning
[929.88 → 930.40] of wisdom
[930.40 → 931.30] they're found
[931.30 → 932.54] in Psalm 110
[932.54 → 933.40] they're found
[933.40 → 934.10] in Proverbs
[934.10 → 934.98] chapter 1
[934.98 → 936.64] and here
[936.64 → 937.44] Job adds
[937.44 → 938.88] and to shun
[938.88 → 939.52] evil
[939.52 → 940.86] is the beginning
[940.86 → 942.00] of understanding
[942.00 → 943.74] the love
[943.74 → 944.42] of the Lord
[944.42 → 945.32] is the beginning
[945.32 → 946.02] of wisdom
[946.02 → 947.48] and to shun
[947.48 → 947.96] evil
[947.96 → 950.24] is the beginning
[950.24 → 951.18] of understanding
[951.18 → 952.88] this really
[952.88 → 953.64] makes Job
[953.64 → 954.22] himself
[954.22 → 954.84] the best
[954.84 → 955.40] example
[955.40 → 956.04] of wisdom
[956.04 → 958.00] because we read
[958.00 → 958.78] in chapter 1
[958.78 → 959.28] verse 1
[959.28 → 960.08] that Job
[960.08 → 961.18] was blameless
[961.18 → 962.10] and upright
[962.10 → 963.62] he feared
[963.62 → 964.34] that is
[964.34 → 965.12] he loved
[965.12 → 965.80] God
[965.80 → 967.06] and he shunned
[967.06 → 967.60] evil
[967.60 → 969.88] the debate
[969.88 → 970.78] shows that Job
[970.78 → 971.50] was not always
[971.50 → 972.20] right either
[972.20 → 973.70] he too made
[973.70 → 974.26] mistakes
[974.26 → 974.94] for which he
[974.94 → 975.58] needed to be
[975.58 → 976.04] corrected
[976.04 → 977.68] but he did
[977.68 → 978.34] have the
[978.34 → 978.78] beginning
[978.78 → 979.78] of wisdom
[979.78 → 981.00] because he
[981.00 → 982.30] loved God
[982.30 → 983.58] and shunned
[983.58 → 984.24] evil
[984.24 → 987.82] isn't it true
[987.82 → 988.42] that today
[988.42 → 989.00] we can do
[989.00 → 990.04] so much more
[990.04 → 991.46] with our signs
[991.46 → 992.46] and our computers
[992.46 → 993.98] we can explore
[993.98 → 996.16] the microcosm
[996.16 → 996.94] of the atoms
[996.94 → 998.08] and we can explore
[998.08 → 999.38] the macrocosm
[999.38 → 1000.20] of the stars
[1000.20 → 1001.16] and the universe
[1001.16 → 1003.32] but we still
[1003.32 → 1004.44] can't find wisdom
[1004.44 → 1006.74] I was reminded
[1006.74 → 1007.30] yesterday
[1007.30 → 1008.48] of that astronaut
[1008.48 → 1010.10] the Russian astronaut
[1010.10 → 1012.06] who was the first
[1012.06 → 1013.00] human being
[1013.00 → 1014.20] to go into space
[1014.20 → 1015.48] and his comment
[1015.48 → 1015.80] was
[1015.80 → 1016.46] I looked out
[1016.46 → 1016.96] the window
[1016.96 → 1017.92] and I didn't see
[1017.92 → 1018.76] God up there
[1018.76 → 1020.60] and somebody
[1020.60 → 1022.12] wisely suggested
[1022.12 → 1022.90] well perhaps
[1022.90 → 1023.66] if you'd stepped
[1023.66 → 1024.28] outside
[1024.28 → 1025.20] you would have
[1025.20 → 1025.72] seen him
[1025.72 → 1028.04] yes
[1028.04 → 1029.98] we have amazing
[1029.98 → 1030.64] resources
[1030.64 → 1032.90] to explore
[1032.90 → 1033.88] the universe
[1033.88 → 1036.08] from the macrocosm
[1036.08 → 1037.26] to the microcosm
[1037.26 → 1038.62] but we still
[1038.62 → 1040.20] can't find wisdom
[1040.20 → 1042.00] as witness
[1042.00 → 1042.78] in our world
[1042.78 → 1043.40] the problems
[1043.40 → 1044.14] of pollution
[1044.14 → 1045.60] of racism
[1045.60 → 1046.82] of wars
[1046.82 → 1048.32] and of crimes
[1048.32 → 1049.36] that affect
[1049.36 → 1050.24] all of us
[1050.24 → 1051.92] today we have
[1051.92 → 1052.80] access to
[1052.80 → 1054.70] amazing resources
[1054.70 → 1055.50] of wealth
[1055.50 → 1057.36] and yet
[1057.36 → 1059.86] do we find
[1059.86 → 1060.78] that the richest
[1060.78 → 1061.46] countries
[1061.46 → 1062.48] in the world
[1062.48 → 1063.66] are always
[1063.66 → 1064.60] the wisest
[1064.60 → 1067.04] not by far
[1067.04 → 1069.14] true wisdom
[1069.14 → 1070.56] is the way
[1070.56 → 1071.54] of reverence
[1071.54 → 1072.46] and obedience
[1072.46 → 1073.50] to God
[1073.50 → 1075.12] to know
[1075.12 → 1076.46] and to follow
[1076.46 → 1077.34] his ways
[1077.34 → 1078.54] and his laws
[1078.54 → 1079.92] to worship
[1079.92 → 1081.40] and to adore
[1081.40 → 1081.82] him
[1081.82 → 1083.42] and that's the call
[1083.42 → 1084.34] to us this morning
[1084.34 → 1084.90] if you want
[1084.90 → 1085.84] to seek wisdom
[1085.84 → 1087.64] then turn to God
[1087.64 → 1089.16] and he will reveal
[1089.16 → 1090.22] the path of wisdom
[1090.22 → 1091.70] to all who seek him
[1091.70 → 1093.54] not always
[1093.54 → 1094.56] to those who seek
[1094.56 → 1095.70] human knowledge
[1095.70 → 1096.46] and skill
[1096.46 → 1097.52] and apply it
[1097.52 → 1099.26] or necessarily
[1099.26 → 1100.52] to those who seek
[1100.52 → 1101.26] the riches
[1101.26 → 1102.38] of this world
[1102.38 → 1104.44] but always
[1104.44 → 1105.28] to those
[1105.28 → 1106.38] who truly
[1106.38 → 1107.56] seek God
[1107.56 → 1108.72] walk
[1108.72 → 1109.62] in his way
[1109.62 → 1111.66] love the Lord
[1111.66 → 1113.14] and shun
[1113.14 → 1113.82] evil
[1113.82 → 1115.40] amen
[1115.40 → 1118.42] shall we pray
[1118.42 → 1122.08] heavenly father
[1122.08 → 1122.84] we thank you
[1122.84 → 1124.06] that you are
[1124.06 → 1124.50] the source
[1124.50 → 1124.98] of wisdom
[1124.98 → 1126.94] and we acknowledge
[1126.94 → 1127.68] lord that there
[1127.68 → 1128.52] are many times
[1128.52 → 1129.24] in our lives
[1129.24 → 1130.18] when we need
[1130.18 → 1130.98] wisdom
[1130.98 → 1134.66] we can't always
[1134.66 → 1135.60] answer the questions
[1135.60 → 1136.40] of the children
[1136.40 → 1139.06] we don't always
[1139.06 → 1139.72] understand
[1139.72 → 1140.34] why things
[1140.34 → 1140.94] are happening
[1140.94 → 1141.88] in our lives
[1141.88 → 1143.84] why we are
[1143.84 → 1144.24] suffering
[1144.24 → 1144.98] why our loved
[1144.98 → 1145.80] ones are suffering
[1145.80 → 1147.26] why we have
[1147.26 → 1147.82] lost
[1147.82 → 1149.10] a loved one
[1149.10 → 1151.28] and sometimes
[1151.28 → 1152.14] we cry our
[1152.14 → 1152.82] to you lord
[1152.82 → 1153.78] why
[1153.78 → 1154.56] oh god

[1160.76 → 1161.32] back to your
[1161.32 → 1161.66] word
[1161.66 → 1162.66] and you
[1162.66 → 1163.24] remind us
[1163.24 → 1163.84] that it is
[1163.84 → 1164.90] the love
[1164.90 → 1165.52] of god
[1165.52 → 1167.10] that is the
[1167.10 → 1167.62] beginning of
[1167.62 → 1168.00] wisdom
[1168.00 → 1170.12] that we are
[1170.12 → 1170.84] called in this
[1170.84 → 1171.56] life to shun
[1171.56 → 1172.00] evil

[1181.06 → 1181.76] to our heart
[1181.76 → 1182.20] through your
[1182.20 → 1182.92] Holy Spirit
[1182.92 → 1183.50] and will you
[1183.50 → 1184.14] lead us
[1184.14 → 1185.32] in your way

[1186.04 → 1186.72] our eyes

[1197.64 → 1198.60] to turn away
[1198.60 → 1199.66] from all
[1199.66 → 1200.48] that is evil
[1200.48 → 1201.62] in our lives
