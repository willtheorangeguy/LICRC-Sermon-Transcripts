[0.00 → 9.16] Well, good morning again. I understand my microphone was off the last time. Are we good now? Okay, excellent.
[10.22 → 16.48] Okay, last week we were together, and we read a parable from the Gospel of Matthew, chapter 13.
[17.14 → 21.20] And those are that 13th chapter of Matthew often called the parables of the kingdom.
[21.44 → 26.48] You know, the sower went out to sow and that's what the kingdom was like and parables of that type.
[26.48 → 29.54] But this time we're going to read from chapter 25.
[30.44 → 36.02] And again, it's a whole chapter of parables and three parables to be exact.
[36.82 → 41.72] And I guess what holds these three together is in each of these parables,
[41.90 → 47.04] people are kind of waiting for an important person to come.
[47.42 → 52.70] So the first is the parable of the ten virgins and some are foolish and some are wise,
[52.70 → 56.60] some are prepared and some are not. They are waiting for the bridegroom.
[57.52 → 61.26] The last of these chapters is about, of these parables of the sheep and the goats.
[61.76 → 67.66] And that, this very important person, the son of man has arrived, and he divides the sheep from the goats.
[67.86 → 69.86] And you may know that story as well.
[70.24 → 73.38] But in the middle, there is a parable we're going to read this morning.
[74.08 → 80.44] And in most of the translations of the Bible, older translations, it's called the parable of the talents.
[80.44 → 85.10] Now, in the translation you're going to see on the screen and may have it open at home,
[85.62 → 88.36] it's called the parable of the bags of gold.
[88.94 → 93.98] So the word talent has been replaced by the term bags of gold.
[94.42 → 96.18] Now, I'm not terribly fond of that.
[97.36 → 102.44] A talent was an exact unit of money, like a dollar or a euro or that sort of thing.
[102.50 → 106.08] It was a very large amount of money, and I'll get to that later on.
[106.08 → 110.44] So what I'm going to do here is when that term bags of gold shows up,
[110.70 → 116.12] I'm going to replace it with the original term talents, which is all the way back to the Greek original.
[116.66 → 119.58] But let's read the story, the parable of the talents.
[119.58 → 127.12] Again, said Jesus, it will be like a man going on a journey who called his servants and entrusted his wealth to them.
[127.94 → 135.08] To one he gave five talents, to another two talents, and to another one, each according to his ability.
[135.98 → 137.68] Then he went on his journey.
[138.80 → 144.84] The man who had received five talents went out at once and put his money to work and gained five more.
[144.84 → 148.62] So also the one with two talents gained two more.
[149.40 → 155.28] But the man who received one talent went off, dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master's money.
[157.00 → 161.42] After a long time, the master of these servants returned and settled accounts with them.
[161.94 → 165.42] The man who had received five talents brought the other five.
[165.54 → 168.60] Master, he said, you have entrusted me with five talents.
[168.74 → 170.54] See, I have gained five more.
[170.54 → 174.88] His master replied, well done, good and faithful servant.
[175.32 → 177.20] You have been faithful with a few things.
[177.32 → 179.62] I will put you in charge of many things.
[179.74 → 181.86] Come and share your master's happiness.
[183.22 → 185.44] The man with two bags of gold also came.
[185.58 → 188.24] Master, he said, you entrusted me with two bags of gold.
[188.86 → 190.70] See, I have gained two more.
[191.72 → 194.38] The master replied, well done, good and faithful servant.
[194.48 → 196.18] You have been faithful with a few things.
[196.52 → 198.68] I will put you in charge of many things.
[198.68 → 201.08] Come and share your master's happiness.
[202.46 → 205.10] Then the man who had received one talent came.
[205.64 → 214.62] Master, he said, I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown, gathering where you have not scattered seed.
[215.06 → 218.22] So I was afraid and went out and hid your talent.
[218.80 → 221.06] See, here is what belongs to you.
[222.16 → 224.70] The master replied, you wicked, lazy servant.
[224.70 → 229.22] So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed.
[229.92 → 236.40] Well, then you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers so that when I returned, I would have received it back with interest.
[236.40 → 243.48] So, take the bag of gold, the talent from him who has, and give it to the one who has ten.
[244.30 → 247.68] For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance.
[248.30 → 252.04] Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.
[252.10 → 259.50] And now, throw that worthless servant outside into the darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
[259.50 → 261.66] This is the word of the Lord.
[263.10 → 270.38] You know, I read something interesting once about very, very wealthy people and their children.
[271.50 → 280.16] It seems that some of the world's wealthiest people do not intend to leave their children all that much.
[280.16 → 290.08] You know, Baron Hilton, who is the hotel tycoon, also the father of Paris Hilton, or the grandfather of Paris Hilton,
[290.58 → 295.48] he once said that he planned to give 97% of his wealth away to charities.
[296.62 → 299.30] So, granddaughter Paris would have to earn her own money.
[300.36 → 301.82] And she did it.
[301.96 → 306.56] She's done very well, actually, by kind of being Kim Kardashian before Kim Kardashian.
[306.72 → 308.66] Sort of famous for being famous.
[308.66 → 310.32] She's made a lot of money.
[311.48 → 314.54] Then there's Warren Buffett, the investment guru.
[315.32 → 322.38] He said that he planned to give 99% of his money away and that his children have to earn their own.
[323.36 → 331.90] And from what I understand, one of his sons has gone into business like his dad and done very well and earned his own money.
[331.90 → 343.56] Now, the thinking here is that you do not do your children a favour by just dropping a lot of money into their hands.
[343.56 → 351.28] Because they will not have to face the ordinary challenges of life that ordinary people face.
[351.28 → 354.08] And that will be damaging.
[355.04 → 360.44] I mean, why work hard if you've got all this money coming at you anyway?
[360.44 → 369.36] Why study hard so that you can get into a good school and earn a good degree?
[370.70 → 371.88] You don't have to study hard.
[372.14 → 376.34] Daddy will build a University of Science building, and then they'll let me in anyway.
[376.34 → 383.78] Why learn a trade and go work for 50 or 60 hours a week?
[384.16 → 389.68] There's no job that can pay more than just inheriting your father's fortune.
[389.68 → 398.84] So when you inherit all this money without any work, then there is no price for failure.
[399.00 → 400.66] At least not a financial price.
[401.72 → 406.98] But you don't face those challenges, those ordinary challenges of life.
[407.84 → 410.14] Now, if you're like me, you can remember your first car.
[410.78 → 414.84] You wanted that car so much because it would make you a grown-up.
[414.84 → 422.72] And so you scraped together some money, and you borrowed some more, and you convinced your dad to co-sign the loan.
[423.04 → 426.66] And you drove off that lot with your own set of wheels.
[426.98 → 428.84] It was a wonderful milestone.
[430.96 → 435.70] But if daddy has lots of money, he'll just give you a car when you're 16.
[436.34 → 437.46] No challenge there.
[438.42 → 442.98] Or think of that first house with the monster mortgage that has to be paid some now.
[442.98 → 446.58] And you do that over years and years of working hard.
[447.96 → 451.20] But when daddy has lots of money, you don't have to do any of that.
[451.72 → 457.82] In fact, an ordinary life with the kind of ordinary achievements that you and I expect.
[458.12 → 460.20] You know, you marry the person you love.
[460.28 → 461.24] You buy the home.
[461.32 → 462.92] You put the children in it.
[462.96 → 464.18] You get them through school.
[464.40 → 465.94] All of that sort of stuff.
[465.94 → 475.04] It's almost like a come down when, you know, your father was going to give you this vast inheritance.
[475.86 → 477.12] What can beat that?
[480.08 → 486.08] Now, it might not seem obvious, but there's something of that going on in this story we just read.
[486.14 → 487.50] There's something of that for us.
[487.50 → 494.14] Because in our own particular way, we are very wealthy.
[495.34 → 503.08] As followers of Jesus and children of the Heavenly Father, we are so blessed.
[503.90 → 506.26] Or as the Apostle Paul would say, we are rich.
[507.14 → 510.62] You know, he once told the Corinthians that Jesus was rich.
[510.62 → 514.68] And yet, for our sakes, he became poor.
[515.38 → 519.40] So that through his poverty, we might become rich.
[521.58 → 526.56] Now, we are rich in a different sort of way, of course.
[526.74 → 529.56] We are kind of spiritually rich.
[529.68 → 535.42] We are rich in that we have the forgiveness of sins and the promise of resurrection.
[535.42 → 544.64] We are rich in that we have a place in the new heaven and the new earth where there will be no mourning or crying or tears or pain anymore.
[545.12 → 550.88] We are already rich in that we have the gifts of the Spirit and the fruit of the Spirit.
[551.10 → 555.06] And all of this is given to us for free.
[558.18 → 560.36] Paul once told the Ephesians.
[560.36 → 561.92] He said,
[561.92 → 564.94] By grace you are saved through faith.
[565.26 → 567.50] And this is not your own doing.
[567.98 → 570.08] It is a gift from God.
[570.54 → 571.74] Not by works.
[572.04 → 573.74] So that no one can boast.
[574.40 → 578.70] So it's like he has to make the point and then make it again and make it again.
[579.66 → 581.52] This is not your own doing.
[581.78 → 583.42] It is a gift from God.
[583.70 → 585.46] So that no one can boast.
[585.90 → 589.12] We have so much given to us.
[589.12 → 593.26] And boy, are we ever rich.
[595.92 → 598.22] So what is there for us to do then?
[600.00 → 604.04] It sort of looks like we can just coast along, right?
[605.22 → 608.76] Because Jesus is taking care of everything for us.
[610.30 → 617.40] Jesus, he preached good news to the poor and freedom to the prisoners and recovery of sight to the blind.
[617.40 → 621.54] Jesus, he bore our griefs and carried our sorrows.
[621.76 → 624.90] And he suffered the punishment that is our peace.
[625.82 → 628.06] Jesus went into the darkness, and he cried,
[628.42 → 631.34] My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
[631.44 → 632.68] That's what he did for us.
[632.82 → 636.62] And we can just stay back warm and safe with nothing to do.
[636.62 → 640.36] Because God and Jesus will take care of it.
[641.64 → 645.44] So you just have to believe and everything's okay.
[646.54 → 648.72] And maybe you should go to church once in a while.
[648.72 → 653.06] Well, how does that sound?
[654.02 → 659.08] I mean, in a superficial way it sounds right, but only in a very superficial way.
[660.12 → 666.86] Because God knows the challenges of people who get too much given to them for free
[666.86 → 672.20] and have no challenges and no projects, no purpose in life.
[673.18 → 679.22] God knows that people without a purpose in life will become unfocused and unhappy.
[680.82 → 684.76] So God doesn't just make us rich in his blessings.
[686.40 → 688.08] He also puts us to work.
[688.08 → 691.52] And he expects some effort.
[694.58 → 698.26] And we read the story of the talents or the bags of gold this morning.
[699.00 → 703.74] Kingdom will be like a man going on a journey who called his servants and entrusted his wealth to them.
[704.46 → 712.16] To one he gave five talents, to another two talents, and to another one, each according to his ability.
[712.16 → 719.34] Now, the first thing I want you to notice here is that these three servants have been given their talents.
[720.84 → 725.76] They are not being paid at the end of the day for work that they have done.
[725.86 → 729.70] Work that they've completed, that's been inspected and improved.
[729.78 → 731.76] Now here is your payment.
[732.22 → 732.42] No.
[732.88 → 738.66] They get this money at the beginning of the day before they have done anything.
[738.66 → 745.54] So without lifting a finger, these three have become rich.
[746.56 → 749.46] And actually, it's very, very rich.
[749.80 → 750.44] A talent.
[750.80 → 755.24] In biblical times, a talent was a huge amount of money.
[756.14 → 763.68] I checked a Bible dictionary some time ago, and it told me that a talent in the Roman Empire times
[763.68 → 770.20] would be worth about 16 years income for an ordinary working person.
[770.34 → 771.58] 16 years income.
[772.92 → 779.34] So if you went off and worked and started early and put in 48 years of hard work,
[779.38 → 784.22] you can do the math, you would earn altogether three talents.
[784.22 → 789.22] So these three servants have been given great wealth.
[790.96 → 794.50] And now we wait and see what they do with that.
[795.48 → 800.08] Well, as the story goes, the five-talent servant goes out and earns five more.
[800.22 → 803.06] The two-talent servant goes out and earns two more.
[803.06 → 813.28] And the third servant, he produces one talent and a dirty bag because he buried it in the ground.
[814.22 → 819.54] There's a reason for that.
[820.56 → 824.88] This third servant buried his talent in the ground because, as he told his boss,
[825.20 → 826.78] you are a hard man.
[827.84 → 829.52] In other words, you are a tough boss.
[830.90 → 834.54] And this one talent servant has a theory about tough bosses.
[834.94 → 837.12] They intimidate their workers.
[837.12 → 845.22] And because they intimidate their workers, their workers are overly careful.
[846.90 → 848.28] And you know how that goes?
[848.44 → 849.28] Not very well.
[850.00 → 852.96] No one is willing to take a risk.
[852.96 → 860.70] Because if you take a risk and things go sideways, and you lose money, the boss will pound on you.
[862.72 → 866.36] And so, says the one talent servant, that's why I buried your talent in the ground.
[866.62 → 870.58] I did not want to fail and get a pounding from you.
[870.74 → 872.58] It is your fault, boss.
[873.22 → 874.52] You intimidated me.
[874.52 → 877.28] You created a hostile work environment.
[881.20 → 885.08] But, as we know, the master would have none of that.
[886.38 → 892.08] If you are given a talent, you must use that talent.
[892.98 → 893.56] You must.
[893.56 → 899.06] And here, the master is kind of using that old investor's line.
[899.22 → 901.12] No risk, no reward.
[902.44 → 905.10] If you take no risk, you earn nothing.
[905.86 → 913.06] You must be willing to go out and use your talent and try to produce something good with it.
[915.32 → 917.92] And in case, you look at the five talent man.
[918.00 → 918.78] He earned five more.
[918.86 → 919.96] The two talent earned two more.
[919.96 → 923.60] Now, would they have always doubled their money every time?
[923.84 → 924.92] Was there a guarantee?
[926.26 → 927.88] Well, we don't hear anything about that.
[928.48 → 929.54] But we do know one thing.
[929.74 → 934.32] If they did nothing but bury their talent in the ground, they would produce nothing.
[935.34 → 937.96] But they were willing to take a risk.
[940.56 → 944.08] So, this is a parable about using our talents.
[944.08 → 951.38] And in the context of Jesus' ministry, it's using our talents until Jesus returns.
[952.82 → 956.96] We are deeply and powerfully blessed.
[958.00 → 960.42] We have the forgiveness of our sins.
[961.08 → 963.76] We have the promise of a new creation.
[963.96 → 965.62] No eye has seen.
[965.74 → 966.70] No ear has heard.
[967.02 → 971.40] No mind can conceive what God has prepared for those who love Him.
[971.40 → 976.24] And already now, we share the gifts of the Spirit and the fruit of the Spirit.
[976.36 → 980.62] Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, gentleness, goodness, self-control.
[980.76 → 982.12] All gifts from God.
[984.32 → 989.82] But just don't think of them as gifts we get for free.
[991.42 → 993.26] Think of them as seed money.
[993.26 → 994.46] Think of them as gifts.
[994.46 → 994.98] Think of them as gifts.
[994.98 → 1001.02] Something that should produce some good in the world and good in the lives of others.
[1005.44 → 1017.82] Now, if you are like a lot of people in the world, you may have one day tried to imagine in your daydreams what you would do if you suddenly got into lots and lots of money.
[1017.82 → 1022.78] Say, some very wealthy uncle passes.
[1023.38 → 1025.76] A very wealthy bachelor uncle.
[1026.58 → 1029.80] And when they open his will, your name is there.
[1030.50 → 1034.16] And in fact, it's the only name in the will.
[1034.26 → 1037.42] And suddenly you are rich beyond your wildest dreams.
[1037.48 → 1039.34] Now, I would not count on that happening.
[1040.00 → 1041.72] But just imagine it would.
[1041.72 → 1047.94] It's one of those questions you sometimes ask just to help you sort out your priorities.
[1048.08 → 1052.18] Sort of like the question, what would you do if you had only a year left to live?
[1052.28 → 1053.26] That sort of thing.
[1053.34 → 1058.60] So, what would you do if you suddenly became fabulously rich?
[1061.04 → 1064.28] Well, I would guess you would have two little voices talking to you.
[1064.28 → 1067.90] And one of those voices would say, live it up.
[1068.72 → 1069.74] Live large.
[1070.96 → 1072.64] Go to Vegas for the weekend.
[1072.84 → 1073.98] Stay at the Taj Mahal.
[1074.10 → 1075.08] Play the slots.
[1076.06 → 1076.96] Take a cruise.
[1077.10 → 1079.00] Once the cruise lines are going again.
[1079.98 → 1081.08] Buy a palace.
[1082.56 → 1083.26] Show off.
[1083.26 → 1089.74] And the other voice would be saying to you, imagine.
[1089.90 → 1094.48] Just think of all the good you can do with what you have been given.
[1095.58 → 1098.84] You can send your children to a wonderful school.
[1099.70 → 1104.42] You can send other children, underprivileged children, to a wonderful school.
[1105.12 → 1109.80] You can pay for good wells in poor villages in poor nations of the world.
[1109.80 → 1117.32] You can do so much good in the world with the gifts you've received.
[1119.32 → 1123.94] Now, if we listen to Jesus' parable, we know which voice we have to listen to.
[1128.50 → 1135.62] Now, every one of us is part of this story because every one of us has been given a talent or a gift.
[1137.00 → 1139.28] Now, you may not feel particularly gifted.
[1139.28 → 1147.84] You may sometimes find yourself looking up at a five-talent person and feeling a sense of envy because they can do so much more than you can.
[1148.28 → 1151.76] But everyone who follows Jesus has been given a gift.
[1151.84 → 1153.84] That is a biblical promise.
[1154.56 → 1161.08] To follow Jesus is to receive a gift of the Spirit, and you can use it for the blessing of others.
[1161.08 → 1162.08] Every one of us.
[1162.08 → 1164.48] Every one of us.
[1167.36 → 1175.48] You know, some years ago, I was a pastor in Duncan, in Vancouver Island, and I had a Sunday off.
[1176.24 → 1178.06] Now, that did not happen very much at the time.
[1178.12 → 1179.86] I was preaching almost all the time.
[1179.86 → 1183.54] But every once in a while, I'd have a free Sunday.
[1184.50 → 1189.74] And if you ask my kids, they'll tell you whenever Dad had a Sunday off, he didn't skip church.
[1189.78 → 1190.46] He would go.
[1190.46 → 1193.40] Or he might go to another church.
[1194.16 → 1196.74] Because Dad would be starving for a sermon.
[1197.64 → 1202.16] Not one that he would preach, but one that he would hear.
[1202.90 → 1209.44] And if you preach a lot, the greatest pleasure is to sit in a pew and hear a wonderful sermon.
[1209.54 → 1210.84] So I wanted that to happen.
[1210.96 → 1212.24] So I didn't have to go far.
[1212.24 → 1216.14] I went to the Presbyterian Church in Duncan.
[1217.18 → 1219.06] And the pastor there was Kerry McIntyre.
[1219.16 → 1221.42] We knew each other through the Ministerial Association.
[1222.40 → 1226.10] And it was a very vibrant Presbyterian Church.
[1226.22 → 1227.82] So I thought I would go.
[1229.58 → 1231.32] But my timing was off.
[1231.48 → 1235.48] Because when I got there, I found out that Pastor Kerry was also off that Sunday.
[1236.20 → 1240.92] And in his place, we were going to have a retired Presbyterian pastor.
[1240.92 → 1244.92] A very old, retired Presbyterian pastor.
[1245.10 → 1246.12] And I thought, rats.
[1247.84 → 1250.12] But that really wasn't fair.
[1251.54 → 1255.64] This retired pastor turned out to be Pastor Kerry's father-in-law.
[1256.06 → 1257.02] Which is fine.
[1257.38 → 1259.54] He also turned out to be a real gem.
[1260.54 → 1266.92] And he preached a sermon that I still remember more than 20 years after I heard it.
[1268.44 → 1270.36] He read his scripture passage.
[1270.36 → 1271.54] The parable of the talents.
[1271.76 → 1272.98] So the same one we just read.
[1274.28 → 1281.06] And then he told a story about attending this big conference for Presbyterian pastors and
[1281.06 → 1284.98] church leaders in some church in a major city.
[1285.54 → 1288.72] And he said this conference was held in a beautiful new church.
[1289.00 → 1290.32] It was very well-built.
[1290.44 → 1292.10] It was very well-equipped and appointed.
[1292.10 → 1298.94] And, you know, this Pastor Kerry's father-in-law said he sat there in this church.
[1298.94 → 1302.52] And he saw the host pastor over there getting all these compliments.
[1302.72 → 1304.72] Beautiful building you have here, Pastor.
[1304.94 → 1305.50] Wonderful.
[1305.50 → 1309.64] And said, Pastor Kerry's father-in-law.
[1310.02 → 1315.40] I sat in my chair, and I was guilty of the sin of envy.
[1315.40 → 1318.92] Why does he have so much?
[1318.92 → 1320.76] It was such a beautiful place.
[1320.92 → 1325.72] And I'm in my little building in my little town.
[1325.72 → 1332.90] And then he said, this story, this story came into my mind.
[1333.64 → 1336.78] And it was like a little voice of God speaking to me.
[1336.86 → 1342.58] Sort of like that little voice of God that spoke to the prophet Elijah on a very bad day.
[1342.58 → 1346.88] So he said, here's what we're going to do with this story.
[1347.62 → 1351.28] We are not going to talk about the five-talent servant.
[1351.38 → 1352.94] The one who went off and earned five more.
[1353.08 → 1354.36] He is the superstar.
[1354.94 → 1356.56] He is the head of the class.
[1356.82 → 1358.04] He is the most popular.
[1358.42 → 1363.04] He gets his names in all the church magazines because he does so well.
[1363.12 → 1364.26] We're not going to talk about him.
[1365.98 → 1370.02] Neither, he said, are we going to talk about the one-talent servant.
[1370.02 → 1375.60] The one who buried his talent in the ground and blamed it on his boss.
[1376.68 → 1377.86] He made me do it.
[1378.00 → 1379.38] No, we're not going to talk about him either.
[1380.62 → 1384.12] Instead, we're going to talk about the two-talent servant.
[1385.18 → 1386.96] The ordinary one.
[1387.90 → 1389.70] The average one.
[1391.14 → 1392.82] Maybe slightly above average.
[1393.30 → 1394.08] Slightly below.
[1394.22 → 1395.98] But somewhere in the middle.
[1395.98 → 1401.02] He said, this is not going to be your superstar.
[1401.98 → 1404.30] He's not going to fly a private jet.
[1405.54 → 1408.78] He's not going to be in the companion of the order of Canada.
[1409.42 → 1412.76] If he's a pastor, he won't be building that mega church.
[1412.94 → 1415.56] He'll just toil away in a modest one somewhere.
[1415.56 → 1418.66] But you know something?
[1419.56 → 1425.80] He is taking the talents he has and using them as the master wants him used.
[1425.80 → 1436.78] And in the end, do you know what this two-talent servant will hear from his master?
[1437.40 → 1444.62] He will hear exactly the same thing, word for word, that the master said to the five-talent servant.
[1445.04 → 1448.02] He will say, well done, good and faithful servant.
[1448.32 → 1450.14] You have been faithful with many things.
[1450.14 → 1454.16] Some things I will give you many more.
[1454.54 → 1457.68] Come and share your master's happiness.
[1459.12 → 1461.08] So here is Mr. Ordinary.
[1462.00 → 1468.16] He goes unnoticed in a crowd, except for the people who knew him well.
[1469.60 → 1473.44] For the people he helped unselfishly again and again.
[1473.44 → 1479.04] For the small blessings he was able to share in his little circle.
[1480.10 → 1485.04] Never famous, but making a difference where he could.
[1486.94 → 1490.86] That is what the two-talent servant can do.
[1494.68 → 1498.30] Each one of you is a gifted person.
[1498.72 → 1501.94] Or to borrow the words of the parable, each one of you has talents.
[1503.44 → 1508.26] Now you can look up at those who have more, but please don't.
[1508.30 → 1512.60] Don't waste your life on jealousy or envy.
[1513.86 → 1519.88] So ask yourself instead, what has God given to me that I can do?
[1521.04 → 1528.94] And how can I use it to be a blessing to others and bring glory to him?
[1528.94 → 1533.26] Join me in prayer.
[1534.54 → 1536.82] Dear Lord, we thank you for the gifts you give.
[1537.32 → 1539.76] For the talents you put into our hands.
[1540.22 → 1541.76] We are so blessed.
[1542.10 → 1543.66] We have so much.
[1544.64 → 1549.34] And now, dear Lord, teach us to use our talents as you would have us use them.
[1549.38 → 1551.80] And we pray this in Jesus' name and for his sake.
[1552.42 → 1552.72] Amen.
[1552.72 → 1552.86] Amen.
[1552.86 → 1552.88] Amen.
[1552.88 → 1552.90] Amen.
[1552.90 → 1552.92] Amen.
[1552.92 → 1552.94] Amen.
