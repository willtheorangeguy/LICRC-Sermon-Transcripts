[0.00 --> 8.24]  Thanks, Ken. Well, good morning again, everyone. I was here last week, privileged to be here,
[8.40 --> 16.62]  and began what I hope will be completed in a number of weeks, a sermon series on the book
[16.62 --> 23.78]  of Jonah. Now, Jonah, as I mentioned last week, is a fairly popular book for vacation Bible school
[23.78 --> 31.04]  programs and Sunday school programs, etc. You know, the drama of the story lends itself to pictures
[31.04 --> 42.66]  and to crayons and to short plays and so forth. But in the drama of the story, there is also a journey
[42.66 --> 50.90]  that we are all invited to participate in. It's not just simply a story. It's an invitation to
[50.90 --> 61.18]  reflection and to understanding. Some people have said that there are three main foci or lessons in
[61.18 --> 68.58]  the book of Jonah. The predominant one, which I think is the right one, is a focus on an understanding
[68.58 --> 76.44]  of the grace of God. But there's also a quest towards justice, to doing what is right,
[76.44 --> 85.84]  and a quest towards dealing with the issue of racism. Because Jonah, as you read the story,
[86.32 --> 96.90]  does not come off as a very nice person, actually. He is a racist. He hates anyone who is not like him.
[96.90 --> 106.58]  He wants to see the Ninevites destroyed. When you look closely at the story, you wonder about the
[106.58 --> 113.66]  source of the story. And the source of the story has to be Jonah himself, whether he wrote it himself,
[113.90 --> 121.80]  or whether he told the story to someone else who then wrote it down. How would that person have known
[121.80 --> 131.08]  it except that Jonah had shared it? It's quite something to think about a person sharing a story
[131.08 --> 139.86]  in which he comes off so negatively. If you're not familiar with a story, it only takes about 20 minutes
[139.86 --> 148.30]  to read, if that. It's four chapters, 67 verses. It's not very long. In my Bible, it's two pages.
[148.30 --> 156.44]  That's it. Last week, we looked at chapter one. It was the story of Jonah receiving the word from God,
[156.54 --> 162.76]  go to Nineveh and preach against that great city, for its wickedness has come up before me.
[163.46 --> 171.82]  And Jonah says, no, I'm not going to go. He stopped to think about that for a minute, because Jonah
[171.82 --> 178.38]  was a prophet of God. We have reference to him in the book of the Kings. He worked at the time of
[178.38 --> 186.82]  Jeroboam II, a king in northern Israel. And he prophesied about the expansion or the recovery
[186.82 --> 197.62]  of Israel's geographical area. And Jeroboam was able to push its boundaries north, became large again.
[197.62 --> 205.86]  Jonah was obviously a successful prophet. What he said came true.
[207.86 --> 216.06]  But Jonah hears this word from God, says, nope, I ain't going. Forget it. Because those Ninevites
[216.06 --> 225.84]  deserve to die. I am not going. And so he runs from God. God stops him with a storm.
[225.84 --> 236.28]  The pagan sailors come off wonderfully good. They try everything they can to save their lives and
[236.28 --> 242.32]  the lives of Jonah. When they ask him, what have you done? He says, well, I'm running away from God.
[242.58 --> 251.62]  Who's God? The God of the Hebrews. The God of the Hebrews who had said to the founder of the Hebrew
[251.62 --> 260.14]  nation, Abraham, I will bless you so that in you all the nations of the earth will be blessed.
[260.14 --> 270.46]  Even when they knew that Jonah was the cause of the problem, they still try to rescue themselves
[270.46 --> 277.32]  in him. Finally, they threw him overboard. And they become worshipers in the text, it says,
[277.42 --> 284.64]  of Yahweh, which is the God of covenant. Every other reference in the book to the Lord is Elohim.
[284.64 --> 295.80]  But the pagan sailors worship Yahweh, the God of covenant. And then a great fish comes to swallow
[295.80 --> 302.26]  Jonah. And that's where we pick up the story. So let me read with you Jonah chapter 2. If you have
[302.26 --> 307.88]  Bibles with you, I invite you to turn to Jonah and then keep your Bibles open because I'll make some
[307.88 --> 315.60]  references to the text from time to time. From inside the fish, Jonah prayed to the Lord, his God.
[316.94 --> 325.34]  He said, in my distress, I called to the Lord and he answered me. From deep in the realm of the dead,
[325.34 --> 335.38]  I called for help. And you listened to my cry. You hurled me into the deep, into the very heart of the
[335.38 --> 342.52]  seas. And the currents swirled about me. All your waves and breakers swept over me. I said,
[342.64 --> 347.78]  I have been banished from your sight. Yet I will look again toward your holy temple.
[349.14 --> 357.46]  The engulfing waters threatened me. The deep surrounded me. Seaweed was wrapped around my head.
[357.46 --> 365.30]  To the roots of the mountains I sank down. The earth beneath barred me in forever.
[366.72 --> 375.90]  But you, Lord my God, brought my life up from the pit. When my life was ebbing away, I remembered you,
[375.98 --> 382.02]  O Lord, and my prayer rose to you, to your holy temple. To those who cling to worthless idols,
[382.02 --> 389.86]  forfeit God's love for them. But I, with shouts of grateful praise, will sacrifice to you.
[389.86 --> 399.16]  What I have vowed, I will make good. I will say, salvation comes from the Lord. And the Lord
[399.16 --> 407.38]  commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land. This is the word of the Lord.
[407.38 --> 413.88]  So what's happening here in this particular chapter? I think it could best be described as a journey
[413.88 --> 422.26]  toward understanding. Have you ever struggled with understanding anything? Think, for example,
[422.36 --> 427.80]  that you come into a new city, and you need to go to a certain location, you don't know how to get
[427.80 --> 433.76]  there, and you stop, and you ask somebody for directions who gives you a whole paragraph worth
[433.76 --> 439.10]  of directions. But you don't want to look stupid, so you agree that you understand everything.
[439.84 --> 445.56]  And then you keep on driving, only to get hopelessly lost. That ever happened to you?
[446.34 --> 452.02]  Of course, we live in the age of GPS now, so we don't even have to ask anymore. We can just simply
[452.02 --> 458.26]  talk to a machine, and it talks back to us. And when we ignore it, it will say, recalculating.
[458.26 --> 466.06]  You know, that's the reality of, you know, a journey toward understanding. Jonah is on a journey toward
[466.06 --> 477.20]  understanding who he is. He is a servant of the God of the Hebrews. He is a servant of a God who says,
[477.50 --> 483.68]  I will bless you so that you, all the nations of the earth, will be blessed.
[483.68 --> 496.84]  In order to understand, Jonah needs to come to a depth of extremity. If you notice in the text,
[496.96 --> 504.46]  if you're very careful and slow, you ever notice how some people often talk about devotions,
[504.56 --> 513.32]  let's just quick pray a minute? Or let's just quickly read a passage? Well, let me ask you,
[513.32 --> 522.96]  not to do it quickly all the time, but to pay careful attention to words, because words have meaning,
[523.52 --> 530.86]  and words ought to be pondered and considered. Do you notice in the text that Jonah goes down
[530.86 --> 538.40]  to Joppa? His geographical location is towards the north. He has to go down towards the south,
[538.40 --> 548.50]  but he goes down to Joppa. And then he goes down under the main deck of the ship. He is in the belly of the
[548.50 --> 558.90]  ship, and there he falls asleep. And then he is thrown overboard, and a fish swallows him, but he goes
[558.90 --> 567.90]  down. He describes that he goes down amongst the weeds into the depths. To understand something,
[568.58 --> 575.52]  you need to come to an awareness of your own ignorance. Let me relate a personal story.
[576.98 --> 583.56]  History was something I loved in high school. Languages was something I wasn't very good at.
[583.56 --> 593.94]  And French was something I really sucked at. And one test indicated I wasn't doing very well,
[594.06 --> 601.22]  so I went to my teacher and I said, I'm not doing very well. And he said, yep. And you know what the
[601.22 --> 610.48]  cause of that is? You're ignorant. He says, you don't know your vocabulary. You don't know how to
[610.48 --> 617.40]  decline these verbs properly. You don't know your spelling properly. You need to do some work.
[618.92 --> 624.88]  I didn't like what he had to say. As a matter of fact, I thought it was a bit insulting,
[625.54 --> 635.84]  but I never forgot it because he was absolutely right. I had to work harder. I had to memorize more.
[635.84 --> 648.32]  I had to ponder. I had to think. I had to be disciplined. And Jonah goes down and notice his feeling.
[648.62 --> 659.00]  In my distress, in my distress, I called to the Lord and he answered me.
[659.00 --> 668.84]  And then as the journey goes, because notice that when he calls to the Lord in distress,
[669.72 --> 677.50]  God doesn't answer him quickly. He doesn't say, oh, fine, Jonah's prayed now. Let's just
[677.50 --> 682.92]  get him out of the fish and get him back onto shore and, you know, keep his journey to about an hour or so.
[682.92 --> 694.76]  Let's do it quickly. Sometimes things take time. I related to you last week that one of the projects
[694.76 --> 701.98]  my wife and I undertook in which we completed this past week was to paint the interior of our house
[701.98 --> 709.52]  from top to bottom. I'm not a very patient person when it comes to things like that. And I decided that
[709.52 --> 717.26]  one of the lessons I needed to learn was I was going to do things patiently. But I was reminded of a bumper sticker
[717.26 --> 727.48]  I saw on the car years ago which said, God, grant me patience, but hurry. Right? But patience doesn't come
[727.48 --> 738.72]  in a hurry. And God takes his time with Jonah. He leaves Jonah in the belly of the great fish for three days.
[739.52 --> 749.72]  And makes him ponder. And in the end, Jonah says, now I get it. He says,
[749.72 --> 759.44]  with shouts of grateful praise, I will sacrifice to you. What I have vowed I will make good.
[759.44 --> 768.04]  I will say, and this is the key verse here, salvation comes from the Lord.
[769.32 --> 772.50]  Now some have argued that this is the key verse in the scriptures.
[773.60 --> 779.68]  And all of the scriptures summed up in these words, salvation comes from the Lord.
[779.68 --> 790.02]  And when Jonah gets it, there is a shout of praise. Just like many people here would shout if the
[790.02 --> 797.42]  Vancouver Canucks won the Stanley Cup in October. Can you imagine? Right? There would be just a shout
[797.42 --> 806.92]  of thankfulness and praise. Wow. We succeeded. Well, Jonah comes to this understanding.
[807.62 --> 816.28]  Salvation is from the Lord. But he doesn't come to it quickly. He needs to go through a process.
[816.28 --> 824.64]  So the beginning of the process has to be the extreme idea. I just don't understand it yet.
[825.74 --> 832.90]  And so what does he have to learn? Well, many of us know quite well question and answer one of the
[832.90 --> 839.86]  Heidelberg Catechism. Anybody have that memorized? What is your only comfort in life and in death?
[839.86 --> 847.50]  That I am not my own, but I belong body and soul and life and death to my faithful Savior, Jesus Christ,
[847.80 --> 853.08]  who has fully paid for all my sin. And it goes on.
[855.42 --> 861.60]  Question and answer two, however, is equally important. What must you know to live and die in the joy of this
[861.60 --> 867.88]  comfort? Number one, how great my sin and misery are. Number two, I am set free from my sin and misery.
[867.88 --> 873.18]  And number three, how I can be thankful for the great salvation that is mine.
[874.20 --> 881.96]  And then the Catechism unfolds those three things. Well, Jonah has to come to an understanding
[881.96 --> 894.88]  of what it means to be a sinner. What it means to come under the wrath of God because of the wickedness
[894.88 --> 904.80]  within. Now, we don't like to think of ourselves very often in terms of sinfulness. Oh, we're not
[904.80 --> 915.74]  perfect, but we're pretty good. And we like to stress our accomplishments. We like to stress our
[915.74 --> 923.60]  freedoms. We like to stress our privileges. We like to stress our rank. We like to stress
[923.60 --> 929.20]  how good we are trying to be.
[931.52 --> 938.78]  And Jonah was a successful prophet. He had the ear of the king. He was respected, no doubt,
[938.88 --> 947.28]  in his community as a servant of God. And now he is in his distress calling out to the Lord
[947.28 --> 958.90]  God. Because he says, you know something? I recognize I cannot save myself. And even one
[958.90 --> 969.90]  imperfection, even one sin makes me subject to the wrath of God. The Apostle Paul in Romans chapter
[969.90 --> 980.02]  1 verse 18 talks about the wickedness of people and how people respond to it. He uses the verb
[980.02 --> 988.40]  to suppress. I don't like to think about that. So I am not going to think about that. I will
[988.40 --> 995.80]  just put it behind me and only think about it maybe when I'm in church and somebody forces me to think
[995.80 --> 1005.86]  about it. But I am not going to think about it. We suppress the truth. Just think about it the next time
[1005.86 --> 1015.44]  a police officer pulls you over for speeding. I wasn't going that fast. We just suppress the truth. And
[1015.44 --> 1023.78]  now Jonah in the belly of the great fish has to come face to face with the truth. And in coming face to
[1023.78 --> 1031.48]  face with the truth, he comes face to face with a second awareness. That he is spiritually powerless.
[1032.74 --> 1041.60]  That he cannot do anything to earn God's favor. We like to try to do that, of course. We like to try
[1041.60 --> 1051.22]  to emphasize how good we are, how many religious practices we have observed, how much time we have
[1051.22 --> 1059.12]  spent in devotions, how many songs we have memorized, and so forth. We always like to stress the things
[1059.12 --> 1065.98]  that we have accomplished. And there is really nothing wrong with that. You could be proud about
[1065.98 --> 1075.22]  what you have accomplished. But you have to recognize that you cannot force God into a position
[1075.22 --> 1084.78]  where he cannot say no to you. And that's what we try to do. We try to make it so that God has to say,
[1085.18 --> 1091.28]  well done, enter in, you have contributed, I have contributed, and together we have accomplished.
[1092.04 --> 1101.80]  No, that's not the way it works biblically. Biblically, we are sinful. God is holy. The two cannot match up.
[1101.80 --> 1114.96]  So what does Jonah have to do? Jonah has to turn towards hope. So if you have your Bibles open,
[1115.68 --> 1124.50]  then I want to, a part of Hebrew writing, and especially poetry, which is what chapter two is
[1124.50 --> 1132.34]  about, the part of Hebrew writing, and poetry, is that you need to look for things which repeat,
[1133.34 --> 1140.06]  because that's where the emphasis wants to fall. Now notice in verse four,
[1140.46 --> 1149.46]  I said I have been banished from your sight, yet I will look again toward your holy temple.
[1149.46 --> 1162.04]  And then notice verse seven, when my life was ebbing away, I remembered you, Lord, and my prayer rose to you,
[1163.00 --> 1173.62]  to your holy temple. So this reference to temple is important. When Jonah was in distress, when he
[1173.62 --> 1186.24]  prayed, when he called out to the Lord, he turned toward the temple. Why? Because the Ark of the Covenant
[1186.24 --> 1195.24]  is in the temple. Remember, this is Old Testament. This is before Jesus. The Ark of the Covenant is in the temple,
[1195.24 --> 1206.76]  and inside the Ark of the Covenant is the copy of the Ten Commandments, God's moral law, which teaches us
[1206.76 --> 1218.12]  how great our sin and misery are, and how we fall short of our sin, of paying for our sin. And then when we
[1218.12 --> 1226.98]  look at the law, we say, well then, what is the answer? Well, above the law, on the top of the Ark of
[1226.98 --> 1235.10]  the Covenant, inside the most holy place of the temple, is a place called the mercy seat. And on the
[1235.10 --> 1242.96]  day of atonement, Yom Kippur, the high priest, could go into the Holy of Holies the one time of the year,
[1242.96 --> 1250.42]  and in his hand, he would have a basin with the blood of a sacrificed lamb, and he would sprinkle
[1250.42 --> 1257.72]  the blood on the mercy seat of the Ark of the Covenant, inside the most holy place, inside the
[1257.72 --> 1268.60]  temple, and God's anger for our sin would be atoned for. A price would be paid. And as Jonah is in the
[1268.60 --> 1275.58]  valley of the great fish, he looks towards the temple, and he looks towards the place where the
[1275.58 --> 1290.56]  price will be paid. And then he gives a shout, salvation is from the Lord. God has provided the
[1290.56 --> 1299.12]  gift. Now, when we run this way ahead, because I sit here and I look, for example, at this red string,
[1299.28 --> 1306.30]  which gives, I guess, a testimony to the fact that there is a story throughout the scriptures. When we
[1306.30 --> 1315.56]  run ahead, the reality of who Jesus is, Jesus is the final atoning sacrifice. If you read the book of
[1315.56 --> 1321.54]  Hebrews, and again, if you pay attention to the words, you will discover that when the priests,
[1321.68 --> 1327.14]  the Old Testament priests, are bringing the sacrifice, they are constantly busy because there
[1327.14 --> 1337.86]  is just a constant pouring out of blood. They're always standing in their service. But when Jesus came
[1337.86 --> 1346.56]  and poured out of blood, in the book of Hebrews, it says, once for all, he sits down.
[1348.78 --> 1353.34]  It's just like if I would sit down, you'd think, well, he's finished, finally.
[1355.68 --> 1361.70]  Except I'm not yet. Right? But this idea of just sitting down is done. It's finished.
[1361.70 --> 1376.44]  Jesus sat down. He paid the price. He set us free. Salvation is of the Lord. And Jonah moves
[1376.44 --> 1382.62]  towards understanding. He becomes aware of his sinfulness, becomes aware of his powerlessness
[1382.62 --> 1388.96]  to do anything about his sinfulness. He turns to the temple, and he sees the provision of sacrifice.
[1388.96 --> 1396.76]  And in time, we see that Jesus is the ultimate sacrifice for our sin. And then we think, oh,
[1396.84 --> 1405.46]  now Jonah gets it. Now he is fully mature. Except he's not. Notice verse 8. Those who cling to worthless
[1405.46 --> 1415.88]  idols forfeit God's love for them. That is true. But Jonah, and you will see this next week and then
[1415.88 --> 1427.52]  a couple of weeks after that, Jonah remains a racist. He remains an imperialist, thinking his nation
[1427.52 --> 1441.56]  should be above the other nations. He remains hateful. He remains angry. He still has a way to go.
[1441.56 --> 1450.40]  But there is hope here. There is hope that God says,
[1452.34 --> 1459.30]  Salve. You've learned salvation is of the Lord. That's enough for now. And he gives the command and
[1459.30 --> 1468.16]  the great fish spits Jonah out, vomits him out on dry ground. That's enough for now. And there's a
[1468.16 --> 1474.04]  vitally important lesson for us to learn in our journey of understanding. And that lesson is this.
[1474.52 --> 1479.14]  Salvation, which is of the Lord, is in a moment and it is in a lifetime.
[1479.14 --> 1489.30]  It is in a moment and it is in a lifetime. You know, part of the delight of being here is listening
[1489.30 --> 1502.10]  to a small child's voice. A contented cry. But think for a moment of the origin of that. The origin of
[1502.10 --> 1513.16]  that was in the moment of fertilization. At that moment, mom was pregnant. It couldn't happen again
[1513.16 --> 1524.16]  for that child. Just in that moment, mom was pregnant. Everything changed. About nine months later or so,
[1524.16 --> 1532.26]  dad got to hold a child. And the doctor probably said, congratulations, you've become a father. No,
[1532.26 --> 1538.98]  that's not right. He became a father about nine months earlier, except had nothing to hold.
[1540.34 --> 1547.32]  There's been a progress and a procession. Now this child is there. Phone calls are made to
[1547.32 --> 1555.06]  grandparents. If it was my father, my father's first question would be, is the child healthy? He would
[1555.06 --> 1560.84]  not ask about gender. And in our day, we couldn't find out gender beforehand. He wouldn't ask about
[1560.84 --> 1570.16]  gender. My dad would say, is the child healthy? My mother would say, what is the child? Boy or girl?
[1570.16 --> 1579.50]  And then, what is the child's name? Well, my father was concerned about the health. And I could say,
[1579.94 --> 1586.02]  everything's fine. Perfect. Ten fingers, ten toes, ears, eyes, everything works. Everything looks good.
[1587.84 --> 1595.90]  But can you imagine if 12 months after that event, our oldest son, who just turned 42,
[1595.90 --> 1604.40]  our oldest son, would have remained exactly the same way he was 12 months before? Same size, same shape,
[1604.78 --> 1615.68]  nothing had happened. We would have been really distressed. Because while he was perfect here on May the 12th,
[1616.42 --> 1625.68]  1978, we would have wanted him to be walking on May the 12th, 1979. Now he was.
[1625.90 --> 1634.92]  But he had developed and he had grown. And it is the same way with us as believers in Jesus.
[1635.16 --> 1642.92]  We come in a moment of time to understand salvation is of the Lord. And I believe in Jesus. And I believe
[1642.92 --> 1649.64]  he died for my sin. And I believe he lives in me. And I believe he is moving in me. And in that moment,
[1649.64 --> 1660.58]  salvation is full of yours. But salvation needs then to be applied and unfolded. The biblical term for
[1660.58 --> 1667.60]  that moment is justification. It is the act of God's free grace where we are changed in a moment,
[1667.70 --> 1674.68]  in a twinkling of an eye. And then the process is the process of sanctification. It is the work of
[1674.68 --> 1681.50]  God's free grace whereby he takes out the garbage of our lives and brings us to be more and more like
[1681.50 --> 1689.84]  his son Jesus. Well, Jonah understood. But he still had some problems with the Ninevites.
[1690.62 --> 1697.30]  He still had some problems with God's mercy. And we'll look at that in the long, in the coming weeks.
[1697.30 --> 1703.72]  But the reality is that for all of us, this is a measure of hope.
[1705.22 --> 1715.86]  We don't need to be fully mature and perfect. What we need is the acknowledgement that God who began
[1715.86 --> 1723.00]  a good work, in the words of the Apostle Paul in Philippians 1, will bring it to completion.
[1723.00 --> 1732.68]  And so two words of understanding. Have hope. Hope in the ongoing work of God in your life
[1732.68 --> 1747.04]  and in the lives of others. And have patience. Patience with the process. But don't be lazy about it.
[1747.04 --> 1755.18]  When I discovered I was failing French, I had to pull up my socks. I had to make a difference.
[1756.04 --> 1762.70]  I never became a French scholar. But at the end of the year, I got a passing grade. And that was really
[1762.70 --> 1773.02]  significant. So while we can be patient, we need to be engaged. This is the word of the Lord. Let's pray.
[1773.02 --> 1779.52]  Father God, we thank you. Thank you for the journey that we're on towards understanding.
[1780.62 --> 1784.90]  Pray, Lord, that we may be patient with ourselves, patient with you, patient with each other.
[1785.32 --> 1790.12]  But that we may also be determined. Determined to learn the lessons that we need to know
[1790.12 --> 1797.86]  at the various stages at which we're at. We pray that we'll not be lazy, but that we will be engaged.
[1797.86 --> 1804.52]  And that we will be driven towards accomplishment. So hear our prayer. Mature us in Christ, we pray.
[1805.52 --> 1806.04]  Amen.
