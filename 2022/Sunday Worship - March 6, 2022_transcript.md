[0.00 --> 2.80]  This night it won't burn out
[2.80 --> 7.00]  For you are perfect
[7.00 --> 11.00]  No matter what
[11.00 --> 14.66]  In the joy of the suffering
[14.66 --> 17.46]  I sing it loud
[17.46 --> 22.44]  I will praise you through the fire
[22.44 --> 25.66]  Through the storm and through the flood
[25.66 --> 29.76]  There is nothing that could ever steal
[29.76 --> 31.98]  My soul
[31.98 --> 34.96]  In the valley
[34.96 --> 36.76]  You are worthy
[36.76 --> 39.96]  You are good when life is not
[39.96 --> 46.14]  You will always and forever be my soul
[46.14 --> 50.56]  When the enemy says I'm done
[50.56 --> 52.92]  I'll lift my praises
[52.92 --> 57.60]  When my world comes crashing down
[57.60 --> 61.48]  I'll lift my praises high
[61.48 --> 64.68]  Till the darkness turns to dawn
[64.68 --> 67.80]  I'll lift my praises
[67.80 --> 70.70]  I choose to worship
[70.70 --> 74.58]  I choose you now
[74.58 --> 75.90]  I choose you now
[75.90 --> 78.90]  When the enemy says I'm done
[78.90 --> 81.90]  I'll lift my praises
[81.90 --> 86.08]  When my world comes crashing down
[86.08 --> 90.08]  I'll lift my praises high
[90.08 --> 92.90]  Till the darkness turns to dawn
[92.90 --> 95.90]  I'll lift my praises
[95.90 --> 98.78]  I choose to worship
[98.78 --> 101.10]  I choose you now
[101.10 --> 107.10]  I will praise you through the fire
[107.10 --> 110.10]  Through the storm and through the flood
[110.10 --> 116.06]  There is nothing that could ever steal my soul
[116.06 --> 118.94]  In the valley
[118.94 --> 119.94]  In the valley
[119.94 --> 120.94]  You are worthy
[120.94 --> 124.94]  You are good when life is not
[124.94 --> 131.28]  You will always and forever be my soul
[131.28 --> 135.16]  When the enemy says I'm done
[135.16 --> 137.16]  I'll lift my praises
[137.16 --> 138.16]  When the enemy says I'm done
[138.16 --> 139.16]  I'll lift my praises
[139.16 --> 141.16]  When the world comes crashing down
[141.16 --> 143.16]  I'll lift my praises
[143.16 --> 144.16]  Oh
[144.16 --> 145.16]  Till the darkness turns to dawn
[145.16 --> 150.04]  Till the darkness turns to dawn
[150.04 --> 153.04]  I'll lift my praises
[153.04 --> 156.04]  I choose to worship
[156.04 --> 159.78]  I choose you now
[159.78 --> 163.28]  I choose you now
[175.16 --> 185.34]  To will please
[185.34 --> 185.58]  Oh
[185.58 --> 185.76]  Oh
[185.76 --> 194.98]  I've heard a thousand stories of what they think you're like
[194.98 --> 201.88]  But I've heard the tender whisper of love
[201.88 --> 213.62]  The dead of night and you tell me that you're pleased and that I'm never alone.
[215.50 --> 218.62]  You're a good, good father.
[219.10 --> 220.72]  It's who you are.
[221.40 --> 223.06]  It's who you are.
[223.60 --> 225.88]  It's who you are.
[225.94 --> 228.50]  And I'm loved by you.
[228.50 --> 230.50]  It's who I am.
[230.50 --> 233.16]  It's who I am.
[233.80 --> 236.58]  It's who I am.
[239.20 --> 249.56]  Oh, and I've seen many searching for answers far and wide.
[249.56 --> 256.64]  But I know we're all searching for answers.
[256.64 --> 268.06]  Only you provide cause you know just what we need before we say a word.
[268.14 --> 270.80]  You're a good, good father.
[270.80 --> 272.80]  It's who you are.
[272.80 --> 274.80]  It's who you are.
[274.80 --> 276.80]  It's who you are.
[276.80 --> 280.50]  And I'm loved by you.
[280.50 --> 282.64]  It's who I am.
[282.64 --> 285.18]  It's who I am.
[285.18 --> 287.18]  It's who I am.
[287.18 --> 288.34]  It's who I am.
[288.34 --> 293.34]  Because you are perfect in all of your ways.
[293.34 --> 298.42]  You are perfect in all of your ways.
[298.42 --> 303.14]  You are perfect in all of your ways.
[303.14 --> 307.22]  To us.
[307.22 --> 321.22]  Oh, it's love so undeniable.
[321.22 --> 338.98]  I can hardly speak.
[338.98 --> 344.98]  Peace so unexplainable lie.
[344.98 --> 350.98]  I can hardly think as you call me.
[350.98 --> 380.96]  Deeper still as you call me.
[380.96 --> 410.94]  It's who I am.
[410.96 --> 440.94]  It's who you are.
[440.96 --> 470.94]  It's who I am.
[470.96 --> 500.94]  It's who I am.
[500.96 --> 530.94]  It's who I am.
[530.94 --> 560.92]  It's who I am.
[560.92 --> 590.90]  It's who I am.
[590.90 --> 620.88]  It's who I am.
[620.88 --> 650.86]  It's who I am.
[651.52 --> 653.86]  Welcome to worship.
[654.18 --> 655.04]  My name is Chris.
[655.24 --> 662.08]  I'm one of the pastors here and it's our privilege to lead you and worship with you this morning.
[662.74 --> 666.46]  Before we begin in earnest, there are a couple announcements that need to be made.
[666.46 --> 681.28]  And so, as Josh and Brandon are coming up to this microphone here, I just wanted to say quickly thank you to everyone who participated in last weekend's Coldest Night of the Year event.
[681.28 --> 683.28]  We raised almost $1,000.
[711.28 --> 713.28]  And I want to thank you for the church.
[713.28 --> 715.28]  And I want to thank you for the church.
[715.28 --> 716.28]  And I want to thank you for the church.
[716.28 --> 727.12]  Yesterday, as Christians and community members gathered together in support of citizens of Ukraine in the conflict with the Russian forces there.
[727.12 --> 729.12]  It was good to see members of the church community.
[729.12 --> 733.40]  It was good to see members of the church community gather together in prayer and encouragement for that.
[733.46 --> 734.92]  And it was good to be part of that.
[735.00 --> 737.00]  And so, for those of you who came, thank you.
[737.00 --> 742.24]  And I think there's going to be some pictures of that and stuff on our social media as well.
[742.32 --> 743.82]  So, you can connect into that.
[744.88 --> 753.54]  And then, finally, for me, just a quick reminder that immediately following our worship this morning, there is Youth Coffee and 2020.
[754.14 --> 755.64]  You'll hear more from Kevin about that later.
[755.68 --> 757.52]  But that's immediately following our service.
[757.66 --> 758.58]  And so, be ready for that.
[763.08 --> 763.56]  Hello.
[763.56 --> 767.98]  Tonight, at 7 p.m., is the Young Adults Board Games Night.
[769.32 --> 771.36]  We're shaking out young adults a little bit.
[772.06 --> 776.14]  At the first Sunday of every month, we're having an event at the church.
[777.60 --> 780.84]  Starting March, going every other month, is Board Games Night.
[781.38 --> 786.64]  And April, every other month, starting with April every other month, is Potluck.
[787.22 --> 789.58]  So, if you want to chill, hang out.
[789.58 --> 793.60]  I realize that a lot of young adults are really busy today with Mexico and youth leading.
[794.18 --> 794.74]  That's okay.
[795.08 --> 796.94]  You guys don't have to go if you don't want to.
[797.30 --> 798.40]  But it's chill.
[799.58 --> 800.94]  Just hang out with some friends.
[801.56 --> 801.92]  Drinks.
[802.76 --> 804.80]  By that, I mean non-alcoholic, if that was ever.
[805.54 --> 805.96]  And, yeah.
[807.42 --> 807.64]  Woo!
[807.64 --> 815.96]  I just wanted to do a quick thank you to everybody that came out last night to the Mexico dinner.
[816.56 --> 817.76]  I thought it was a lot of fun.
[817.90 --> 821.66]  It was good to see you guys and just share a meal with you guys as well and be able to hang out.
[822.34 --> 823.42]  We've fundraised quite a bit.
[823.64 --> 829.16]  So, it was actually very comparable to other years, despite the short notice, which thank you guys for giving.
[829.16 --> 831.42]  And kind of putting your faith in us with that trip.
[832.06 --> 836.00]  The other announcement I got is the commissioning service for our trip is next Sunday.
[836.00 --> 839.20]  So, that will be the send-off for us as we're leaving the day after.
[839.64 --> 842.36]  And just appreciate you all being there for that as well.
[842.62 --> 843.52]  So, thank you.
[848.40 --> 848.84]  Okay.
[849.00 --> 858.82]  As some of you may be aware, if you participated in our Ash Wednesday event here, Imposition of the Ashes, or not.
[858.90 --> 861.62]  But today is the first Sunday of Lent.
[861.62 --> 872.48]  Lent is the season that leads us into Holy Week with Good Friday and then Easter Sunday, culminating in the resurrection of Jesus.
[872.70 --> 880.46]  Lent is a time and a season for us to focus our hearts on all that God has done to draw us to himself.
[881.30 --> 888.78]  And so, our worship this morning is going to have that particular focus of expressing our need as we enter into the presence of God.
[888.78 --> 896.42]  And I'm going to name that here and now because as you stand, if you are able and where you are to be greeted by God,
[896.58 --> 902.20]  this is the season where God draws us to himself powerfully.
[902.20 --> 907.52]  And so, know that when we receive God's greeting, that is him saying,
[907.72 --> 913.58]  Come to me, all who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
[913.90 --> 916.10]  So, as you are able and where you are, would you stand?
[916.68 --> 922.52]  We could enter into our Lenten worship together as God greets us in his name.
[922.52 --> 933.94]  Brothers and sisters of our Lord Jesus Christ, grace, mercy, and peace to you this Lent season.
[934.94 --> 941.76]  From God our Father, from Jesus Christ his Son, through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[943.10 --> 943.46]  Amen.
[943.46 --> 943.54]  Amen.
[943.54 --> 953.76]  1 Peter 1, verse 3 and 4 say,
[954.76 --> 958.32]  All praise to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[958.94 --> 963.40]  It is by his great mercy that we have been born again,
[964.06 --> 967.40]  because God raised Jesus Christ from the dead.
[967.40 --> 970.76]  Now we live in great expectation,
[971.24 --> 974.02]  and we have a priceless inheritance,
[974.64 --> 977.84]  an inheritance that is kept in heaven for you,
[979.04 --> 980.64]  pure and undefiled,
[981.38 --> 983.82]  beyond the reach of change and decay.
[983.82 --> 998.52]  In the darkness we were waiting,
[999.00 --> 1000.32]  without hope,
[1000.76 --> 1002.30]  without light,
[1002.30 --> 1005.66]  till from heaven you came running,
[1005.98 --> 1009.64]  there was mercy in your eyes,
[1009.64 --> 1013.18]  to fulfill the law and prophets,
[1013.60 --> 1016.86]  to a virgin came the word,
[1017.20 --> 1020.38]  from a throne of endless glory,
[1020.92 --> 1024.00]  to a cradle in the dirt.
[1030.48 --> 1033.60]  Praise the Father,
[1033.60 --> 1037.28]  Praise the Son,
[1037.28 --> 1041.28]  Praise the Spirit,
[1041.28 --> 1044.96]  Three in one,
[1044.96 --> 1048.60]  God of glory,
[1049.24 --> 1051.68]  Majestice,
[1051.68 --> 1059.88]  Praise forever to the King of kings.
[1059.88 --> 1067.66]  To reveal the kingdom coming,
[1067.66 --> 1071.48]  and to reconcile the lost,
[1071.80 --> 1074.86]  to redeem the whole creation,
[1075.40 --> 1078.74]  you did not despise the cross,
[1079.06 --> 1082.20]  for even in your suffering,
[1082.66 --> 1085.90]  you saw to the other side,
[1086.34 --> 1089.32]  knowing this was our salvation,
[1089.32 --> 1090.44]  Jesus,
[1090.44 --> 1090.46]  Jesus,
[1090.46 --> 1090.48]  Jesus,
[1090.66 --> 1093.06]  for our sake you died.
[1099.06 --> 1102.56]  Praise the Father,
[1103.28 --> 1106.34]  Praise the Son,
[1107.00 --> 1109.88]  Praise the Spirit,
[1110.68 --> 1113.38]  Three in one,
[1113.38 --> 1117.22]  God of glory,
[1117.22 --> 1118.90]  majesty,
[1118.90 --> 1119.84]  majesty,
[1119.84 --> 1127.96]  praise forever to the King of kings.
[1127.96 --> 1128.44]  Amen.
[1132.44 --> 1136.38]  And the morning that you rose,
[1136.76 --> 1140.24]  all of heaven held its breath,
[1140.60 --> 1143.76]  till that stone was moved for good,
[1143.76 --> 1147.50]  for the Lamb had conquered death,
[1147.50 --> 1150.88]  and the dead rose from their tombs,
[1151.24 --> 1154.50]  and the angels stood in awe,
[1154.50 --> 1157.94]  for the souls of all who come,
[1158.38 --> 1161.06]  to the Father are restored,
[1162.06 --> 1164.98]  and the church of Christ was born,
[1165.38 --> 1168.50]  and the Spirit with the flame,
[1168.50 --> 1171.88]  now this gospel truth of all,
[1171.88 --> 1173.76]  shall not be in,
[1173.98 --> 1175.62]  shall not face,
[1175.62 --> 1178.88]  by His blood and in His name,
[1179.28 --> 1182.28]  in His freedom I am free,
[1182.80 --> 1185.82]  for the love of Jesus Christ,
[1186.24 --> 1189.24]  who has resurrected me.
[1189.24 --> 1198.36]  praise the Father,
[1198.36 --> 1201.72]  praise the Son,
[1201.72 --> 1205.18]  praise the Spirit,
[1205.18 --> 1208.54]  three in one,
[1208.54 --> 1212.36]  God of glory,
[1212.36 --> 1214.62]  majesty,
[1214.62 --> 1222.68]  praise forever to the King of kings.
[1222.68 --> 1231.24]  praise forever to the King of kings.
[1231.24 --> 1241.38]  As we worship together this first Sunday of Lent,
[1241.94 --> 1245.50]  let us bring to mind the things that distract us from worship,
[1245.82 --> 1247.30]  and relationship to God.
[1248.24 --> 1250.68]  Let's pray this prayer of confession together,
[1251.18 --> 1254.72]  confessing our sins in the sure promises of forgiveness.
[1254.72 --> 1258.44]  Almighty God,
[1258.94 --> 1260.72]  in Jesus Christ,
[1260.86 --> 1261.72]  you love us,
[1262.12 --> 1263.86]  but we have not loved you.
[1264.78 --> 1267.26]  You have opened your heart to us,
[1267.64 --> 1269.12]  and in our pride,
[1269.36 --> 1270.64]  we have spurned your care.
[1271.48 --> 1273.48]  You have given us all things,
[1273.66 --> 1275.42]  and we have squandered your gifts.
[1276.26 --> 1277.58]  We have grieved you,
[1277.98 --> 1279.62]  and caused hurt to others,
[1279.90 --> 1283.00]  and we are not worthy to be called your children.
[1283.00 --> 1286.40]  Have mercy on us, O Lord,
[1286.94 --> 1288.30]  for we are ashamed,
[1289.06 --> 1292.14]  and sorry for all we have done to displease you.
[1293.16 --> 1294.66]  Cleanse us from our sin,
[1295.18 --> 1297.92]  and receive us again into your household,
[1298.48 --> 1301.42]  that we might nevermore stray from your love,
[1302.00 --> 1305.22]  but always remain within the sound of your voice,
[1305.70 --> 1307.58]  and near to your holy heart.
[1308.26 --> 1308.64]  Amen.
[1313.00 --> 1337.40]  The holy heart was broken,
[1337.40 --> 1343.34]  sent from the Father's side,
[1343.34 --> 1348.34]  the Son of God forsaken,
[1349.56 --> 1353.22]  the holy sacrifice.
[1355.12 --> 1359.30]  For me he was forsaken,
[1359.30 --> 1364.60]  for me he died alone,
[1364.60 --> 1370.54]  my sin forever taken,
[1370.54 --> 1376.54]  that I might be his own.
[1376.54 --> 1381.54]  The holy lamb was stricken,
[1382.80 --> 1386.54]  abandoned and alone.
[1388.24 --> 1392.36]  He bore the world's affliction,
[1392.36 --> 1398.30]  He bore it as his own.
[1398.30 --> 1403.52]  For me he was forsaken,
[1404.30 --> 1408.30]  for me he died alone,
[1408.30 --> 1414.38]  my sin forever taken,
[1414.38 --> 1419.98]  that I might be his own.
[1419.98 --> 1425.92]  And when my heart is broken,
[1425.92 --> 1431.92]  torn by my sin and pride,
[1431.92 --> 1437.12]  the Son of God now risen,
[1437.92 --> 1442.92]  will draw me to his side.
[1442.92 --> 1448.86]  For me he died,
[1448.86 --> 1452.86]  for me he died alone.
[1452.86 --> 1454.86]  For me he died alone,
[1454.86 --> 1458.86]  my sin forever taken,
[1458.86 --> 1463.86]  that I might be his own.
[1463.86 --> 1468.86]  For me he was forsaken,
[1468.86 --> 1474.80]  for me he died alone.
[1474.80 --> 1476.80]  For me he died alone,
[1476.80 --> 1480.80]  my sin forever taken,
[1480.80 --> 1486.80]  that I might be his own.
[1486.80 --> 1492.74]  For me he died alone.
[1492.74 --> 1495.04]  That was close.
[1495.74 --> 1496.74]  Isaiah 54,
[1496.74 --> 1498.26]  54 verse 7 and 8 say,
[1498.34 --> 1500.54]  For a brief moment I abandoned you,
[1500.98 --> 1503.24]  but with deep compassion I will bring you back.
[1503.74 --> 1507.10]  In a surge of anger I hid my face for you for a moment,
[1507.74 --> 1511.16]  but with everlasting kindness I will have compassion on you,
[1511.48 --> 1513.20]  says the Lord your Redeemer.
[1513.20 --> 1517.94]  As we begin the journey of Lent starting in loneliness and darkness,
[1517.94 --> 1522.30]  we move toward the cross and the light of the gospel.
[1522.30 --> 1527.64]  We move towards Christ, our hope in life and death.
[1527.64 --> 1543.38]  Christ alone, Christ alone,
[1543.38 --> 1545.80]  Christ alone,
[1545.80 --> 1550.70]  What is our hope in life and death?
[1550.70 --> 1555.20]  Christ alone, Christ alone,
[1555.20 --> 1560.30]  What is our only confidence?
[1560.30 --> 1564.90]  That our souls to him belong,
[1564.90 --> 1569.82]  Who holds our days within his hand,
[1569.82 --> 1574.30]  What comes apart from his command,
[1574.30 --> 1579.80]  And what will keep us to the end?
[1579.80 --> 1585.70]  The love of Christ in which we stand?
[1588.14 --> 1592.26]  Oh, sing hallelujah,
[1592.26 --> 1597.10]  Our hope springs eternal.
[1597.10 --> 1601.90]  Oh, sing hallelujah,
[1601.90 --> 1606.22]  Now and ever we confess,
[1606.22 --> 1610.80]  Christ our hope in life and death.
[1616.64 --> 1621.90]  What truth can calm the troubled soul?
[1622.68 --> 1626.78]  God is good, God is good,
[1626.78 --> 1631.78]  Where is his grace and goodness known?
[1631.78 --> 1636.58]  In vain our great Redeemer's blood,
[1636.58 --> 1641.58]  Who holds our faith when fears arise,
[1641.58 --> 1646.38]  Who stands above the stormy trial,
[1646.38 --> 1651.64]  Who sends the waves that bring us night,
[1651.64 --> 1658.14]  Unto the shore of the rock of Christ.
[1658.14 --> 1664.10]  Oh, sing hallelujah,
[1664.10 --> 1668.94]  Our hope springs eternal.
[1668.94 --> 1673.68]  Oh, sing hallelujah,
[1673.68 --> 1677.98]  Now and ever we confess,
[1677.98 --> 1682.56]  Christ our hope in life and death.
[1688.96 --> 1694.34]  Unto the grave what shall we sing?
[1694.34 --> 1699.34]  Christ he lives,
[1699.34 --> 1700.34]  Christ he lives,
[1700.34 --> 1704.34]  And what reward will heaven bring?
[1704.34 --> 1709.34]  Everlasting life with him,
[1709.34 --> 1714.34]  There we will rise to meet the Lord,
[1714.34 --> 1719.34]  Then sin and death will be destroyed,
[1719.34 --> 1724.34]  And we will feast in endless joy,
[1724.34 --> 1731.34]  When Christ is ours forevermore.
[1731.34 --> 1736.34]  Oh, sing hallelujah,
[1736.34 --> 1740.34]  Our hope springs eternal.
[1740.34 --> 1745.34]  Oh, sing hallelujah,
[1745.34 --> 1750.34]  Now and ever we confess,
[1750.34 --> 1754.34]  Christ our hope in life and death.
[1754.34 --> 1759.34]  Oh, sing hallelujah,
[1759.34 --> 1763.34]  Our hope springs eternal.
[1763.34 --> 1767.34]  Oh, sing hallelujah,
[1767.34 --> 1771.34]  Now and ever we confess,
[1771.34 --> 1775.34]  Christ our hope in life and death.
[1775.34 --> 1778.34]  Now and ever we confess,
[1778.34 --> 1784.34]  Christ our hope in life and death.
[1784.34 --> 1788.34]  You may have a seat.
[1788.34 --> 1809.34]  That's my daughter.
[1809.34 --> 1815.34]  Anyway, this morning our first collection is for the budget,
[1815.34 --> 1818.34]  For the ministries of this church.
[1818.34 --> 1822.34]  And I think Brandon is going to come and talk to us.
[1830.34 --> 1833.34]  I promise this is probably the last time you'll hear from me.
[1833.34 --> 1834.34]  Hopefully.
[1834.34 --> 1835.34]  So no, yeah,
[1835.34 --> 1837.34]  The second offering is for Mexico,
[1837.34 --> 1839.34]  For our trip again this year.
[1839.34 --> 1843.34]  And I guess we just kind of want to go over what your guys' money actually goes to,
[1843.34 --> 1846.34]  What you guys are supporting there and some of the history of it, I guess.
[1846.34 --> 1848.34]  So when we go down to Mexico,
[1848.34 --> 1851.34]  We support kind of two main people.
[1851.34 --> 1854.34]  One is Abilino's church and one is Jodi.
[1854.34 --> 1856.34]  I don't know if Jodi's here right now.
[1856.34 --> 1858.34]  Yeah, she's waving right there.
[1858.34 --> 1859.34]  So we,
[1859.34 --> 1861.34]  Those are the two main areas we focus on now,
[1861.34 --> 1864.34]  Who we're supporting and who we work with and everything like that.
[1864.34 --> 1866.34]  So Jodi now actually works at the connections home,
[1866.34 --> 1868.34]  Which is a new place we're now going to be staying at.
[1868.34 --> 1872.34]  It's a short term missionary kind of hosting group.
[1872.34 --> 1879.34]  Plus they work with a lot of different groups and people in Mexico themselves and support them as well.
[1879.34 --> 1882.34]  So Jodi's working there as well as at their house.
[1882.34 --> 1883.34]  They are running a men's,
[1883.34 --> 1884.34]  It's a men's rehab,
[1884.34 --> 1886.34]  But it's kind of like a halfway house as well.
[1886.34 --> 1887.34]  Where they kind of,
[1887.34 --> 1889.34]  When you get out of rehab in Mexico,
[1889.34 --> 1891.34]  You're kind of just dumped on the street.
[1891.34 --> 1892.34]  You have nowhere to really go,
[1892.34 --> 1893.34]  Nobody to support you.
[1893.34 --> 1895.34]  And usually you relapse.
[1895.34 --> 1898.34]  It's not like in Canada where there's a secondary place you can go to,
[1898.34 --> 1902.34]  To actually kind of continue your recovery and kind of get back into the swing of life.
[1902.34 --> 1904.34]  So they're running one there for men.
[1904.34 --> 1906.34]  And we'll be supporting them with that as well.
[1906.34 --> 1910.34]  And visiting and just kind of getting to know that whole side of it.
[1910.34 --> 1914.34]  Abilino, the history with him is 11 years ago, I believe it is now.
[1914.34 --> 1916.34]  When I was living down in Mexico,
[1916.34 --> 1919.34]  I met him through the Mexican family I was living with down there.
[1919.34 --> 1923.34]  And we kind of started supporting him through that.
[1923.34 --> 1925.34]  Abilino, first when I met him,
[1925.34 --> 1927.34]  His house slash church,
[1927.34 --> 1928.34]  It was all operated in the same way.
[1928.34 --> 1930.34]  But he was going to school to become a pastor.
[1930.34 --> 1931.34]  And he was,
[1931.34 --> 1933.34]  He had a small congregation of six people.
[1933.34 --> 1935.34]  And their church and house was probably the size,
[1935.34 --> 1937.34]  If you take piano to the wall there,
[1937.34 --> 1939.34]  And just the size of the drums really.
[1939.34 --> 1940.34]  That was their church.
[1940.34 --> 1943.34]  And we know one wall was a garage door that you'd be pushed on,
[1943.34 --> 1945.34]  It collapsed and the other wall was a tarp.
[1945.34 --> 1948.34]  And the entrance was kind of a piece of rotten plywood.
[1948.34 --> 1950.34]  So that's what they started with when I started working there.
[1950.34 --> 1952.34]  So when our team went down,
[1952.34 --> 1953.34]  We,
[1953.34 --> 1954.34]  They,
[1954.34 --> 1956.34]  Our team came down to meet me while I was living there with Brad Koonst.
[1956.34 --> 1959.34]  And the first thing we kind of did with them is we built them a house.
[1959.34 --> 1961.34]  And just a bigger area to actually have their services.
[1961.34 --> 1963.34]  And then over the next 11 years,
[1963.34 --> 1965.34]  A couple other teams have kind of partnered with us,
[1965.34 --> 1966.34]  Partnered with Abilino.
[1966.34 --> 1968.34]  And we built them a new church now.
[1968.34 --> 1972.34]  Where his congregation has now gone from six people to 88,
[1972.34 --> 1974.34]  88 actual adult members.
[1974.34 --> 1975.34]  Plus all the children.
[1975.34 --> 1977.34]  So it's grown huge.
[1977.34 --> 1978.34]  And then as well,
[1978.34 --> 1979.34]  We've kind of just,
[1979.34 --> 1982.34]  We re-evaluated three years ago.
[1982.34 --> 1984.34]  The missions committee went down with me.
[1984.34 --> 1985.34]  And we,
[1985.34 --> 1986.34]  We met with Abilino.
[1986.34 --> 1987.34]  And we met with everybody.
[1987.34 --> 1988.34]  And just kind of decided like,
[1988.34 --> 1990.34]  We've always,
[1990.34 --> 1992.34]  We've obviously had issues with people in Mexico before.
[1992.34 --> 1994.34]  With ministries and things we found that like,
[1994.34 --> 1995.34]  Okay, this actually isn't helping anybody.
[1995.34 --> 1997.34]  So we wanted to re-evaluate that.
[1997.34 --> 1999.34]  And we re-evaluated that with Abilino.
[1999.34 --> 2002.34]  And we kind of came up with a five year plan to better help them.
[2002.34 --> 2004.34]  As well as just kind of,
[2004.34 --> 2006.34]  Kind of have not,
[2006.34 --> 2008.34]  End goal is the wrong word for it.
[2008.34 --> 2010.34]  But like have a purpose for our own trips as well.
[2010.34 --> 2012.34]  That spans past just year to year.
[2012.34 --> 2013.34]  So we kind of met with them.
[2013.34 --> 2015.34]  We kind of decided the big one was,
[2015.34 --> 2018.34]  There's always lots of teams willing to support people in Mexico.
[2018.34 --> 2020.34]  But nobody down there actually knows how to build a house.
[2020.34 --> 2022.34]  Or build a church.
[2022.34 --> 2023.34]  Or build anything.
[2023.34 --> 2024.34]  Right?
[2024.34 --> 2026.34]  They, they're all used to concrete building.
[2026.34 --> 2028.34]  Concrete building is inefficient in Mexico.
[2028.34 --> 2029.34]  Takes years.
[2029.34 --> 2030.34]  It's expensive.
[2030.34 --> 2032.34]  And it's just not feasible for a short term missions team to do.
[2032.34 --> 2035.34]  But a lot of teams that go down there have no experience doing it either.
[2035.34 --> 2036.34]  And they have,
[2036.34 --> 2037.34]  They have the money to do it.
[2037.34 --> 2041.34]  But there's nobody down there with Abilino that can actually teach them how to build it.
[2041.34 --> 2042.34]  Or show them how to build it.
[2042.34 --> 2044.34]  And use that manpower to their,
[2044.34 --> 2045.34]  To an advantage.
[2045.34 --> 2047.34]  So our five year plan of course,
[2047.34 --> 2049.34]  COVID took two years out of that already.
[2049.34 --> 2054.34]  But we started it three years ago with building them a secondary soup kitchen.
[2054.34 --> 2056.34]  As well as a garage or vehicles and things like that.
[2056.34 --> 2057.34]  But we actually,
[2057.34 --> 2059.34]  We work with the people in the church.
[2059.34 --> 2062.34]  To teach them how to build using wood framing.
[2062.34 --> 2064.34]  So we kind of go through this,
[2064.34 --> 2065.34]  Like the specifics of it.
[2065.34 --> 2066.34]  You know,
[2066.34 --> 2067.34]  The engineering of it.
[2067.34 --> 2068.34]  The strength.
[2068.34 --> 2069.34]  What you can do.
[2069.34 --> 2070.34]  What you really can't do.
[2070.34 --> 2072.34]  Because I know in a lot of time Mexico they like to cut corners.
[2072.34 --> 2073.34]  So we try to teach,
[2073.34 --> 2074.34]  You know, don't do that.
[2074.34 --> 2076.34]  The roof falling on your head hurts.
[2076.34 --> 2077.34]  So,
[2077.34 --> 2078.34]  That's kind of the plan.
[2078.34 --> 2080.34]  And it's going to be over five years.
[2080.34 --> 2082.34]  We have a couple of key people down there that we're working with.
[2082.34 --> 2084.34]  That already have experience doing it.
[2084.34 --> 2085.34]  But they just need more,
[2085.34 --> 2086.34]  More confidence if anything.
[2086.34 --> 2089.34]  And then we're teaching the other members of their church as well.
[2089.34 --> 2091.34]  So over the next four years.
[2091.34 --> 2092.34]  One year,
[2092.34 --> 2093.34]  One team's already taken care of one.
[2093.34 --> 2095.34]  They built them a secondary soup kitchen.
[2095.34 --> 2097.34]  In a different location.
[2097.34 --> 2100.34]  And then one of those original six members is now leading that soup kitchen.
[2100.34 --> 2103.34]  But then we're also going to plan on building them a church.
[2103.34 --> 2104.34]  A homeless shelter.
[2104.34 --> 2105.34]  And in the process,
[2105.34 --> 2107.34]  Those are two actually quite big builds.
[2107.34 --> 2108.34]  We'll be teaching them how to build.
[2108.34 --> 2109.34]  Things like that.
[2109.34 --> 2113.34]  And it just kind of allowed them when that team comes down.
[2113.34 --> 2116.34]  And there is a really desperate need for either a new church.
[2116.34 --> 2118.34]  Because he likes to plant churches a lot too.
[2118.34 --> 2120.34]  Or if there's a need for a house burns down.
[2120.34 --> 2122.34]  They can build that house.
[2122.34 --> 2123.34]  They can build that church.
[2123.34 --> 2125.34]  And they can do it themselves as well.
[2125.34 --> 2126.34]  There's a lot of other groups down there.
[2126.34 --> 2127.34]  And a lot of other.
[2127.34 --> 2129.34]  Like YWAM for example.
[2129.34 --> 2130.34]  If you want to build a house through them.
[2130.34 --> 2132.34]  Number one, it costs you 20% extra.
[2132.34 --> 2136.34]  Second, all they are willing to build is a little box.
[2136.34 --> 2138.34]  So you might have a family of six or seven.
[2138.34 --> 2140.34]  And they get one bedroom and one little kitchen.
[2140.34 --> 2142.34]  And that's all they're ever willing to build.
[2142.34 --> 2145.34]  And it doesn't really suit the needs of the actual people.
[2145.34 --> 2147.34]  We prefer to teach them, you know, if you have a family of four.
[2147.34 --> 2148.34]  Here's two bedrooms.
[2148.34 --> 2149.34]  This is how you do it.
[2149.34 --> 2150.34]  If you have a family of six.
[2150.34 --> 2151.34]  Here's three bedrooms.
[2151.34 --> 2152.34]  This is how you do it.
[2152.34 --> 2155.34]  Build to actually suit the needs of the people you're building for.
[2155.34 --> 2157.34]  So you're not just building them a little box.
[2157.34 --> 2160.34]  Leaving them that doesn't actually really work for them, right?
[2160.34 --> 2161.34]  And also save the money.
[2161.34 --> 2166.34]  Because then these other groups can do it by using Abilino's own church members to actually do the build.
[2166.34 --> 2168.34]  So that's kind of the five year plan.
[2168.34 --> 2170.34]  And then that way we're kind of hoping at the end of those five years.
[2170.34 --> 2172.34]  Of course we're still going to go down.
[2172.34 --> 2173.34]  We still like that relationship.
[2173.34 --> 2175.34]  We're still going to build with them.
[2175.34 --> 2178.34]  But the whole purpose will then become we don't need to be there to build.
[2178.34 --> 2179.34]  We don't need to be there to do anything.
[2179.34 --> 2181.34]  They can do it all themselves now.
[2181.34 --> 2184.34]  And even if a need comes down and we can just take our Mexico budget and go,
[2184.34 --> 2186.34]  Look, we'll fund the build.
[2186.34 --> 2188.34]  We'll pay for the materials using our contacts.
[2188.34 --> 2191.34]  You guys can build it in August when we can't be down there.
[2191.34 --> 2193.34]  Or in November or whatever.
[2193.34 --> 2195.34]  It just gives a lot more flexibility.
[2195.34 --> 2199.34]  And then when something happens, it's not like they're waiting five months for us to come down to do something about it.
[2199.34 --> 2204.34]  So that's kind of, that's the overarching goal of what you guys are supporting.
[2204.34 --> 2206.34]  Probably a lot to take in kind of thing.
[2206.34 --> 2210.34]  But that's, that's what our, our purpose is down there.
[2210.34 --> 2211.34]  And what we're kind of doing down there.
[2211.34 --> 2215.34]  And what as a church we've kind of agreed on to support and work on.
[2215.34 --> 2217.34]  So that's about it.
[2217.34 --> 2221.34]  But yeah, we'll be heading down on, for this actual trip itself, we won't actually be doing much building.
[2221.34 --> 2224.34]  We'll be probably doing a couple bathrooms for the church that was already built.
[2224.34 --> 2226.34]  Because those are not completed yet.
[2226.34 --> 2229.34]  We'll be finishing those for the team that started those.
[2229.34 --> 2231.34]  But otherwise, a lot of our youth is new.
[2231.34 --> 2233.34]  A lot of them have never been before.
[2233.34 --> 2237.34]  So we're kind of just working on a big part of the Mexico thing as well as just relationships.
[2237.34 --> 2243.34]  We don't want to just be, you know, the white savior that builds a house and that leaves and never comes back.
[2243.34 --> 2248.34]  We want an ongoing relationship, an ongoing friendship, become sister churches kind of thing, right?
[2248.34 --> 2250.34]  So these youth have never been before.
[2250.34 --> 2256.34]  That relationship over these last two years because of COVID, that doesn't really exist in the youth standpoint of it.
[2256.34 --> 2257.34]  So we want to build that again.
[2257.34 --> 2263.34]  So we'll be spending a lot of time in the community, doing community festivals, meeting with people, visiting people's houses,
[2263.34 --> 2270.34]  just sitting down for dinner with them, kind of like we did at the Mexico dinner, doing youth coffee, taking their youth out for stuff,
[2270.34 --> 2272.34]  things like that to build that relationship again.
[2272.34 --> 2278.34]  And yeah, the building project will just be probably finishing those washrooms in whatever state that those were left in.
[2278.34 --> 2280.34]  So that is all.
[2280.34 --> 2283.34]  Sorry for taking up so much time, but thank you for your support.
[2283.34 --> 2284.34]  We really do appreciate it.
[2284.34 --> 2286.34]  And every year you guys come through for us.
[2286.34 --> 2288.34]  So let's really appreciate it.
[2288.34 --> 2295.34]  The song that we're going to be singing during the offering has really been on my heart this week.
[2295.34 --> 2297.34]  It's called Ancient of Days.
[2297.34 --> 2303.34]  And the lyrics, I think, speak very much to what's going on in the world right now, especially in the Ukraine.
[2303.34 --> 2306.34]  So please listen and join in when you're comfortable.
[2306.34 --> 2326.34]  The song that we're going to be singing during the offering is beautiful.
[2326.34 --> 2335.82]  Though the nations rage, kingdoms rise and fall,
[2335.82 --> 2345.66]  there is still one King reigning over all.
[2345.94 --> 2355.62]  So I will not fear, for this truth remains.
[2355.62 --> 2364.42]  That my God is the Ancient of Days.
[2365.76 --> 2375.50]  None above Him, none before Him, all of time in His hands.
[2375.50 --> 2383.62]  For His throne it shall remain and ever stand.
[2383.62 --> 2394.42]  All the power, all the glory, I will trust in His name.
[2394.42 --> 2403.52]  For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[2403.52 --> 2418.82]  Though the dread of night overwhelms my soul, He is here with me.
[2418.82 --> 2428.50]  I am not alone, though His love is sure.
[2428.50 --> 2433.50]  And He knows my name.
[2433.50 --> 2441.30]  For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[2441.30 --> 2453.10]  None above Him, none before Him, all of time in His hands.
[2453.10 --> 2461.10]  For His throne it shall remain and ever stand.
[2461.10 --> 2471.90]  All the power, all the glory, I will trust in His name.
[2471.90 --> 2479.70]  For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[2479.70 --> 2485.26]  Please stand as we sing the rest of this song.
[2485.26 --> 2505.36]  Though I may not see what the future brings,
[2505.36 --> 2515.36]  I will watch and wait for the Savior King.
[2515.36 --> 2525.36]  Then my joy complete, standing face to face,
[2525.36 --> 2526.36]  God is the Ancient of Days.
[2526.36 --> 2535.36]  In the presence of the Ancient of Days.
[2535.36 --> 2544.36]  None above Him, none before Him, all of time in His hands.
[2544.36 --> 2550.36]  For His throne it shall remain and ever stand.
[2550.36 --> 2563.36]  All the power, all the glory, I will trust in His name.
[2563.36 --> 2572.36]  For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[2572.36 --> 2584.36]  For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[2584.36 --> 2585.36]  May we have a seat.
[2585.36 --> 2586.36]  God.
[2586.36 --> 2587.36]  God.
[2587.36 --> 2588.36]  God.
[2588.36 --> 2589.36]  God.
[2589.36 --> 2590.36]  God.
[2590.36 --> 2592.36]  God.
[2592.36 --> 2593.36]  God.
[2593.36 --> 2594.36]  God.
[2594.36 --> 2595.36]  God.
[2595.36 --> 2596.36]  God.
[2596.36 --> 2597.36]  God.
[2597.36 --> 2598.36]  God.
[2598.36 --> 2599.36]  God.
[2599.36 --> 2600.36]  God.
[2600.36 --> 2601.36]  God.
[2601.36 --> 2602.36]  God.
[2602.36 --> 2603.36]  God.
[2603.36 --> 2604.36]  God.
[2604.36 --> 2605.36]  God.
[2605.36 --> 2607.36]  God.
[2607.36 --> 2608.36]  God.
[2608.36 --> 2609.36]  God.
[2609.36 --> 2610.36]  God.
[2610.36 --> 2611.36]  God.
[2611.36 --> 2612.36]  God.
[2612.36 --> 2613.36]  God.
[2613.36 --> 2615.36]  God.
[2615.36 --> 2617.36]  God.
[2619.36 --> 2620.36]  God.
[2620.36 --> 2621.36]  God.
[2621.36 --> 2622.36]  God.
[2622.36 --> 2623.36]  God.
[2623.36 --> 2624.36]  God.
[2624.36 --> 2625.36]  God.
[2625.36 --> 2626.36]  God.
[2626.36 --> 2627.36]  God.
[2627.36 --> 2628.20]  God.
[2628.20 --> 2629.36]  God.
[2629.36 --> 2630.22]  God.
[2630.22 --> 2631.16]  God.
[2631.16 --> 2632.22]  God.
[2632.22 --> 2634.76]  Alright, how's all the kids doing? How are you guys doing? Yeah?
[2635.84 --> 2640.44]  When you woke up this morning and saw the sunshine out there, was that like, this is going to be a great day?
[2641.00 --> 2642.58]  Yeah? Are you going to play outside lots?
[2643.58 --> 2650.42]  How many of you guys are going to be forced to go on a walk or a hike today by your parents?
[2652.44 --> 2652.84]  Yeah?
[2654.42 --> 2654.78]  Right.
[2656.94 --> 2658.58]  Probably going to be doing that today, aren't you?
[2658.58 --> 2665.40]  Last week, I couldn't be here, but I heard you guys did a story about a miracle that Jesus did.
[2665.48 --> 2667.54]  Does anybody know or remember what that one was about?
[2668.22 --> 2668.76]  What was it?
[2671.24 --> 2677.34]  The bread and the, Jesus broke bread and, or had some bread and did what with it?
[2681.36 --> 2683.80]  Fish and bread to about 5,000 people.
[2683.88 --> 2685.74]  How many people do you think are in the church here today?
[2685.80 --> 2686.26]  What do we think?
[2686.26 --> 2688.06]  About 200?
[2688.44 --> 2689.60]  Maybe, let's say 500.
[2689.76 --> 2692.08]  That would be like 10 times as many people here.
[2692.16 --> 2693.42]  That's pretty amazing, isn't it?
[2694.58 --> 2696.16]  Can I answer your questions later?
[2696.62 --> 2697.32]  Does that sound good?
[2698.16 --> 2699.42]  Is that going to work for you?
[2703.00 --> 2705.00]  Can I answer your questions later?
[2705.00 --> 2709.48]  Today, we are going to talk about treasure.
[2709.72 --> 2712.46]  Does anybody know anything about treasure hunts?
[2712.50 --> 2713.78]  Has anybody ever been on one?
[2713.86 --> 2714.22]  Oh, yeah?
[2714.96 --> 2717.56]  Treasure hunts and treasure chests.
[2717.72 --> 2717.96]  Right.
[2718.24 --> 2722.56]  So we're going to talk about treasure today in the children's worship time.
[2722.64 --> 2732.48]  We're going to talk about how we are Jesus' treasure and he came to save us and came to save us from all our sins.
[2732.48 --> 2736.62]  How many people here have ever been on a treasure hunt before?
[2737.66 --> 2737.98]  Yeah?
[2738.16 --> 2740.64]  Well, who was here last night at the Mexico dinner?
[2741.90 --> 2742.48]  Or, yeah.
[2742.98 --> 2744.52]  Some of you guys were, I recognize you.
[2744.70 --> 2746.44]  And it was a good time.
[2746.44 --> 2753.90]  Well, when I was cleaning up and helping out around here, I went into the back room and I saw this back there in the back room.
[2753.98 --> 2755.24]  So I thought, oh, this looks kind of funny.
[2755.30 --> 2756.28]  Doesn't this look kind of weird?
[2757.26 --> 2763.98]  So I took it apart and I opened it up and I found this.
[2764.90 --> 2766.16]  What does this look like?
[2766.18 --> 2767.06]  A map.
[2768.08 --> 2770.88]  And on this map, maybe you guys can help me a little bit here.
[2770.96 --> 2771.84]  Look at this map.
[2771.84 --> 2772.90]  It's a treasure map.
[2773.34 --> 2775.50]  It's a bit of a treasure map here.
[2777.20 --> 2778.38]  So what do we got here?
[2778.50 --> 2781.18]  Can anybody tell some of the things on this?
[2781.62 --> 2782.76]  Oh, there's a playground.
[2783.04 --> 2783.92]  What's this right here?
[2785.00 --> 2786.62]  Is that this over here in the corner?
[2786.96 --> 2787.24]  Yeah.
[2787.98 --> 2788.30]  Okay.
[2788.50 --> 2790.44]  And this is probably us right here, right?
[2790.76 --> 2791.08]  Yeah.
[2791.54 --> 2792.82]  And that's the door.
[2793.24 --> 2794.32]  That looks like the kitchen.
[2794.48 --> 2795.56]  What are these things right here?
[2796.24 --> 2797.30]  Those are the bathrooms.
[2797.30 --> 2799.12]  They're the bathrooms, actually.
[2799.22 --> 2802.36]  I know the guy who drew this map is not a very good artist.
[2805.10 --> 2806.44]  So I think.
[2806.70 --> 2807.60]  That's a treasure map.
[2807.60 --> 2807.86]  Okay.
[2808.28 --> 2808.58]  Okay.
[2808.86 --> 2809.10]  Okay.
[2809.36 --> 2811.32]  This is spiraling out of control here.
[2812.30 --> 2812.70]  Okay.
[2813.16 --> 2814.78]  You know what we're going to do right now?
[2815.22 --> 2815.66]  Okay.
[2815.80 --> 2816.72]  Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[2816.72 --> 2817.00]  Okay.
[2817.10 --> 2817.24]  Shh.
[2817.34 --> 2817.74]  My turn.
[2817.74 --> 2820.08]  My turn to talk.
[2820.88 --> 2826.10]  We are, after we do the blessing, we are going to follow this map and see if we can find
[2826.10 --> 2827.78]  where the treasure is on this map.
[2828.50 --> 2829.18]  All right.
[2829.80 --> 2839.54]  So why don't we all stand up, turn around, and we are going to have a good time this morning.
[2839.78 --> 2840.18]  Everybody.
[2842.58 --> 2844.22]  Does everybody know what we're supposed to do?
[2846.98 --> 2851.52]  The Lord be with you and also with you.
[2852.46 --> 2853.00]  All right.
[2853.28 --> 2853.96]  No running.
[2854.42 --> 2855.34]  We're going to go this way.
[2856.10 --> 2885.64]  Bye.
[2886.10 --> 2890.12]  Good morning.
[2892.20 --> 2895.32]  My name is Ken, and I'm an elder here at Emanuel Church,
[2895.74 --> 2898.82]  and today I'll be leading us in our church family prayer.
[2899.02 --> 2901.88]  But before we go into that, I have a couple just minor announcements.
[2902.74 --> 2907.48]  First of all, in your e-bulletins, I'm pretty sure everyone should be receiving the e-bulletin by email.
[2907.58 --> 2913.04]  If you don't, you can reach out to the church office to get your email address added to their list.
[2913.04 --> 2918.06]  But in the e-bulletin, there's a notice about Matt and Nicole's wedding that's coming up,
[2918.40 --> 2920.28]  and the date on that is not quite right.
[2920.36 --> 2922.88]  It's March the 12th, Saturday, not the 13th.
[2922.90 --> 2925.32]  So it's at 2 p.m. here at Emanuel Church,
[2925.50 --> 2929.86]  and all are welcome to come and witness the marriage of Matt and Nicole.
[2931.04 --> 2934.98]  And also, we are having the Lord's Supper next Sunday,
[2935.14 --> 2938.34]  so we're asked to just be mindful of that,
[2938.34 --> 2940.28]  take some time this week to prepare your hearts,
[2940.28 --> 2945.04]  talk to your kids about what it is we're doing as we partake in the Lord's Supper,
[2945.54 --> 2947.28]  and reflect on that as we prepare.
[2948.60 --> 2953.60]  Additionally, I just heard that Herman Weaver's dad passed away in Alberta this week,
[2953.68 --> 2957.20]  so we will uphold him and their family in our prayers as well.
[2957.94 --> 2961.90]  So let's turn to our Lord and bow our hearts and heads together in prayer.
[2961.90 --> 2967.38]  Our Father in heaven, you are so awesome and almighty.
[2968.22 --> 2971.12]  As we have just sung, you are the Ancient of Days,
[2971.80 --> 2975.14]  the King of Kings, and our hope in life and in death.
[2976.06 --> 2979.86]  We know and recognize, Lord, that amid the joys and the trials,
[2980.24 --> 2982.06]  amid the blessings and the difficulties,
[2982.74 --> 2984.98]  in all places and in all circumstances,
[2985.38 --> 2986.86]  our world belongs to you, Lord.
[2986.86 --> 2989.76]  The earth is yours and everything in it,
[2990.10 --> 2991.92]  the world and all who live in it.
[2992.40 --> 2994.08]  So we come to you, Lord, this morning
[2994.08 --> 2996.94]  with our joys and our burdens and lift them up to you.
[2998.22 --> 3001.38]  We pray for all those, Lord, who are mourning the loss of loved ones.
[3002.08 --> 3005.10]  We pray for Herman Weaver, as his dad has just passed away in Alberta,
[3005.20 --> 3007.54]  and we pray for their family, Lord, be near to them.
[3008.50 --> 3010.82]  We ask that you be near to the Denhan family
[3010.82 --> 3014.08]  and the Miles families as well, who have recently lost loved ones.
[3014.08 --> 3017.10]  And we pray that you bring comfort to all who mourn,
[3017.48 --> 3019.26]  both for those who have lost loved ones recently
[3019.26 --> 3022.50]  and for those who still mourn loved ones lost long ago.
[3024.26 --> 3025.74]  Lord, we pray for Matt and Nicole,
[3025.94 --> 3027.84]  who will be getting married in one week.
[3028.54 --> 3029.80]  Bless their preparations, Lord,
[3029.94 --> 3032.14]  and bless the wedding and bless their marriage.
[3032.80 --> 3035.04]  We pray for all the marriages of your people here.
[3035.66 --> 3038.36]  Lord, let them be a reflection of the covenant love
[3038.36 --> 3040.60]  and relationship between Christ and the Church.
[3041.56 --> 3043.82]  Help our marriages to be filled not only with love,
[3043.82 --> 3045.24]  but equally with grace.
[3046.90 --> 3050.84]  We pray, Lord, for your hand on the devastating situation in Ukraine.
[3051.54 --> 3053.10]  As we see cities attacked,
[3053.44 --> 3055.22]  people's homes and livelihoods destroyed,
[3055.78 --> 3056.80]  freedom under threat,
[3057.16 --> 3059.44]  and lives taken, Lord, we pray for peace
[3059.44 --> 3061.30]  and an end to the bombings and the fighting.
[3062.36 --> 3064.58]  Lord, we pray for safety for the civilians
[3064.58 --> 3067.40]  who are trapped with no water or heat in Mariupol.
[3068.42 --> 3070.22]  Lord, please work with the hearts of those
[3070.22 --> 3073.84]  who can instate ceasefire to give these people a chance to get out.
[3075.22 --> 3077.80]  We pray, Lord, for the over 1.5 million refugees
[3077.80 --> 3079.78]  who have fled to Poland and other places.
[3080.56 --> 3082.84]  Be near to them in this terrible situation
[3082.84 --> 3086.02]  and bless the work and efforts of all who are helping refugees.
[3087.02 --> 3088.64]  Help us, Lord, to reach out
[3088.64 --> 3091.00]  and to be a support in whatever ways possible.
[3092.40 --> 3094.40]  Lord, we thank you for the peace and the freedoms
[3094.40 --> 3095.92]  that we experience here in Canada.
[3095.92 --> 3098.40]  Help us not to become complacent
[3098.40 --> 3101.16]  or dismiss wars and tensions in this world
[3101.16 --> 3102.34]  as someone else's problem.
[3103.36 --> 3105.30]  Lord, our whole world belongs to you.
[3105.76 --> 3107.70]  Help us be the hands and feet of Jesus
[3107.70 --> 3109.82]  to the refugee, to the embattled,
[3110.00 --> 3111.36]  to the hurt, and to the lost.
[3113.06 --> 3114.38]  Lord, we also pray this morning
[3114.38 --> 3116.10]  for our church ministry here at Emmanuel
[3116.10 --> 3118.82]  and to the ministry that we're about to embark on
[3118.82 --> 3120.10]  through the Mexico missions trip.
[3120.90 --> 3122.58]  Lord, we lift up to you
[3122.58 --> 3124.44]  our team of young people and the youth leaders
[3124.44 --> 3127.16]  who are preparing to leave to serve in the Tijuana area.
[3127.92 --> 3130.20]  We ask, Lord, for safety for the group as they travel
[3130.20 --> 3132.16]  and that you will use each one of them
[3132.16 --> 3133.94]  to minister to the people they meet.
[3134.76 --> 3136.60]  We pray that through this work
[3136.60 --> 3137.78]  you will further your kingdom
[3137.78 --> 3140.24]  and change the lives of the people in Mexico
[3140.24 --> 3142.78]  and of each member of our team from this church.
[3144.34 --> 3147.44]  We also pray, Lord, for our church body and denomination.
[3148.16 --> 3149.36]  We pray for the classist meeting
[3149.36 --> 3151.48]  that's about to take place this week in Abbotsford.
[3152.28 --> 3153.48]  Bless the delegates as they meet
[3153.48 --> 3155.02]  and work through the many topics,
[3155.16 --> 3157.10]  including the impacts of the COVID pandemic
[3157.10 --> 3159.72]  and of the flooding that took place in Abbotsford.
[3160.74 --> 3162.32]  Lord, bring healing and restoration
[3162.32 --> 3165.42]  to all who have been directly affected by these things
[3165.42 --> 3168.54]  and to all of us who are affected one way or another.
[3169.68 --> 3170.96]  Things so often take longer
[3170.96 --> 3172.76]  to get back to normal than we like.
[3173.24 --> 3174.24]  Give us patience, Lord.
[3174.24 --> 3178.22]  Lord, we pray as we prepare our hearts
[3178.22 --> 3179.48]  for the Lord's Supper next week
[3179.48 --> 3183.12]  that we will reflect on the sacrifice
[3183.12 --> 3184.86]  that you've given to us in your son
[3184.86 --> 3187.72]  and the symbol that we get to partake in
[3187.72 --> 3189.16]  as we partake in the Lord's Supper.
[3190.92 --> 3193.78]  Lord, we pray for all who are feeling struggles right now,
[3194.44 --> 3195.50]  including those who struggle
[3195.50 --> 3197.98]  with the increased cost of living we're all experiencing.
[3198.86 --> 3200.72]  Help us put our trust in you
[3200.72 --> 3203.84]  and to seek out and to help our brother and sister
[3203.84 --> 3206.06]  within our families, within our church,
[3206.06 --> 3208.30]  our communities and throughout your world,
[3208.82 --> 3209.74]  wherever there is need.
[3211.02 --> 3213.28]  And Lord, now as we are turning to your word,
[3213.52 --> 3215.40]  we pray your blessing on Pastor Chris
[3215.40 --> 3217.48]  as he brings us your word this morning.
[3218.22 --> 3219.92]  Lord, speak to us during this time.
[3220.36 --> 3221.30]  Impact our lives.
[3221.64 --> 3222.90]  And as we go out this week,
[3223.24 --> 3224.88]  help us minister to your world.
[3225.34 --> 3228.16]  We ask all this in the name of our blessed Savior, Jesus.
[3228.76 --> 3229.02]  Amen.
[3236.06 --> 3260.56]  We are absolutely going to continue our worship
[3260.56 --> 3263.58]  in God's word together
[3263.58 --> 3265.86]  for the next little while.
[3266.32 --> 3268.48]  And this morning,
[3269.40 --> 3271.92]  as we have been working through the book of Exodus,
[3273.04 --> 3275.38]  as we come into the text,
[3275.50 --> 3278.46]  which we'll read from Exodus 19 and 20.
[3278.68 --> 3280.22]  So if you have a Bible, you can get that ready.
[3280.48 --> 3281.48]  We'll read that in just a moment.
[3281.58 --> 3283.90]  It will be on the screen behind me as well.
[3284.62 --> 3288.42]  But I want to start by framing it for us
[3288.42 --> 3290.10]  by asking the question,
[3291.02 --> 3294.28]  what is life supposed to look like?
[3296.28 --> 3299.92]  What are we supposed to do in this world?
[3301.00 --> 3305.06]  And depending on what you believe about the world,
[3305.16 --> 3307.98]  you will answer that question differently.
[3309.48 --> 3313.68]  If you believe that life is ultimately meaningless
[3313.68 --> 3317.06]  and that all we have are the years on this planet,
[3317.60 --> 3320.84]  life will probably look like the pursuit of happiness,
[3321.42 --> 3324.44]  will look like increasing personal safety
[3324.44 --> 3327.56]  and personal, maybe familial,
[3327.72 --> 3329.82]  and maybe communal comfort
[3329.82 --> 3333.96]  as the goals and values of living in this world.
[3335.64 --> 3338.94]  Maybe your idea about life
[3338.94 --> 3342.68]  is the pursuit of status and reputation.
[3342.68 --> 3345.70]  And then what you do in life
[3345.70 --> 3347.82]  will be whatever you must
[3347.82 --> 3350.00]  in order to gain that, right?
[3350.06 --> 3351.54]  To climb higher.
[3353.04 --> 3356.26]  Maybe your experience tells you
[3356.26 --> 3359.10]  that life is supposed to be
[3359.10 --> 3363.50]  about the maximal experience of well-being
[3363.50 --> 3366.52]  for the maximum number of people possible.
[3366.82 --> 3368.82]  Or maybe it's the other side
[3368.82 --> 3371.10]  and your experience tells you
[3371.10 --> 3372.54]  that life is meaningless
[3372.54 --> 3374.26]  and that there's no bigger point.
[3374.34 --> 3375.30]  And then so what's the point
[3375.30 --> 3376.32]  of anything along the way?
[3377.42 --> 3378.92]  Whether it's, you know,
[3379.00 --> 3380.90]  traditional philosophical hedonism
[3380.90 --> 3383.52]  or traditional philosophical nihilism
[3383.52 --> 3384.50]  on the other side,
[3384.66 --> 3387.36]  we all have an idea in this world,
[3387.44 --> 3390.16]  we all operate out of an idea
[3390.16 --> 3392.78]  about what life is supposed to look like.
[3392.78 --> 3396.76]  We all have a sort of frame
[3396.76 --> 3398.92]  or a social imaginary
[3398.92 --> 3400.20]  or a worldview
[3400.20 --> 3403.40]  that we hold tight to
[3403.40 --> 3404.96]  that has assumptions
[3404.96 --> 3407.58]  about what we're supposed to do
[3407.58 --> 3409.40]  or how we're supposed to be,
[3409.90 --> 3413.12]  what it means to live the good life
[3413.12 --> 3415.80]  or what it means to live in community
[3415.80 --> 3417.32]  or as an individual.
[3417.32 --> 3419.86]  Now what we're going to read this morning
[3419.86 --> 3424.68]  is the summary of the traditional Jewish
[3424.68 --> 3427.88]  and then eventually Judeo-Christian answer
[3427.88 --> 3429.38]  to this question.
[3430.34 --> 3432.50]  We're going to read the Ten Commandments.
[3434.12 --> 3434.66]  And then,
[3435.60 --> 3438.20]  instead of looking at each commandment individually,
[3439.14 --> 3439.98]  if you're interested,
[3440.12 --> 3441.70]  we can save that for another series
[3441.70 --> 3442.84]  sometime in the future,
[3442.84 --> 3446.54]  we're going to look at sort of a 30,000 foot view
[3446.54 --> 3449.72]  of what it means to live life with God
[3449.72 --> 3451.28]  in gratitude to God
[3451.28 --> 3453.36]  for the glory of God.
[3454.80 --> 3456.02]  And so as we read,
[3456.10 --> 3456.92]  we're going to start
[3456.92 --> 3459.10]  in chapter 19
[3459.10 --> 3460.56]  at verse 16
[3460.56 --> 3462.88]  to sort of set the narrative context
[3462.88 --> 3464.40]  and then we'll get into
[3464.40 --> 3465.54]  the Ten Commandments themselves.
[3466.82 --> 3468.14]  So, hear the word of the Lord.
[3470.04 --> 3472.64]  On the morning of the third day,
[3472.84 --> 3474.64]  there was thunder and lightning
[3474.64 --> 3477.38]  with a thick cloud over the mountain
[3477.38 --> 3479.54]  and a very loud trumpet blast.
[3480.32 --> 3481.72]  Everyone in the camp trembled.
[3482.70 --> 3485.52]  Then Moses led the people out of the camp
[3485.52 --> 3486.44]  to meet with God
[3486.44 --> 3489.16]  and they stood at the foot of the mountain.
[3490.28 --> 3492.08]  Mount Sinai was covered with smoke
[3492.08 --> 3494.74]  because the Lord descended on it in fire
[3494.74 --> 3496.56]  and the smoke billowed up from it
[3496.56 --> 3497.84]  like smoke from a furnace
[3497.84 --> 3500.00]  and the whole mountain trembled violently.
[3500.00 --> 3502.68]  And as the sound of the trumpet
[3502.68 --> 3503.88]  grew louder and louder,
[3504.06 --> 3504.98]  Moses spoke
[3504.98 --> 3506.60]  and the voice of God
[3506.60 --> 3507.68]  answered him.
[3509.22 --> 3510.52]  The Lord descended
[3510.52 --> 3512.58]  to the top of Mount Sinai
[3512.58 --> 3513.48]  and called Moses
[3513.48 --> 3515.00]  to the top of the mountain.
[3516.12 --> 3517.22]  So Moses went up
[3517.22 --> 3518.32]  and the Lord said to him,
[3518.76 --> 3520.12]  go down and warn the people
[3520.12 --> 3521.94]  so they do not force their way through
[3521.94 --> 3522.90]  to see the Lord
[3522.90 --> 3524.50]  and many of them perish.
[3524.50 --> 3526.10]  Even the priests
[3526.10 --> 3527.18]  who approach the Lord
[3527.18 --> 3528.50]  must consecrate themselves
[3528.50 --> 3530.60]  or the Lord will break out against them.
[3532.00 --> 3533.46]  Moses said to the Lord,
[3534.56 --> 3536.54]  the people cannot come up Mount Sinai
[3536.54 --> 3538.64]  because you yourself warned us,
[3538.76 --> 3539.88]  put limits around the mountain
[3539.88 --> 3541.28]  and set it apart as holy.
[3542.42 --> 3543.44]  The Lord replied,
[3543.86 --> 3546.36]  go down and bring Aaron up with you,
[3547.22 --> 3548.68]  but the priests and the people
[3548.68 --> 3550.34]  must not force their way through
[3550.34 --> 3551.42]  to come up to the Lord
[3551.42 --> 3553.32]  or he will break out against them.
[3554.32 --> 3555.98]  So Moses went down to the people
[3555.98 --> 3557.16]  and told them.
[3558.72 --> 3562.36]  And God spoke all these words.
[3563.72 --> 3566.08]  I am the Lord your God
[3566.08 --> 3568.18]  who brought you out of Egypt,
[3568.32 --> 3569.94]  out of the land of slavery.
[3570.12 --> 3572.52]  You shall have no other gods before me.
[3573.66 --> 3575.18]  You shall not make for yourself
[3575.18 --> 3577.84]  an image in the form of anything
[3577.84 --> 3578.58]  in heaven above
[3578.58 --> 3579.78]  or in the earth beneath
[3579.78 --> 3580.82]  or in the waters below.
[3581.42 --> 3583.30]  You shall not bow down to them
[3583.30 --> 3584.30]  or worship them,
[3584.80 --> 3586.42]  for I, the Lord your God,
[3586.46 --> 3587.44]  am a jealous God,
[3587.54 --> 3588.70]  punishing the children
[3588.70 --> 3589.88]  for the sin of the parents
[3589.88 --> 3591.46]  to the third and fourth generation
[3591.46 --> 3592.56]  of those who hate me,
[3592.80 --> 3593.72]  but showing love
[3593.72 --> 3595.16]  to a thousand generations
[3595.16 --> 3596.56]  of those who love me
[3596.56 --> 3598.00]  and keep my commandments.
[3599.32 --> 3600.78]  You shall not misuse
[3600.78 --> 3602.34]  the name of the Lord your God,
[3602.40 --> 3603.46]  for the Lord will not hold
[3603.46 --> 3604.48]  anyone guiltless
[3604.48 --> 3605.88]  who misuses his name.
[3607.56 --> 3609.24]  Remember the Sabbath day
[3609.24 --> 3610.52]  by keeping it holy.
[3611.62 --> 3613.16]  Six days you shall labor
[3613.16 --> 3614.48]  and do all your work,
[3614.96 --> 3616.22]  but the seventh day
[3616.22 --> 3618.00]  is a Sabbath to the Lord your God.
[3618.80 --> 3620.88]  On it you shall not do any work,
[3620.96 --> 3622.22]  neither you nor your son
[3622.22 --> 3622.74]  or daughter,
[3622.84 --> 3624.38]  nor your male or female servants,
[3624.50 --> 3625.16]  nor your animals,
[3625.28 --> 3626.42]  nor the foreigner
[3626.42 --> 3627.82]  residing in your towns.
[3628.12 --> 3629.40]  For in six days
[3629.40 --> 3630.56]  the Lord made the heavens
[3630.56 --> 3631.48]  and the earth,
[3631.70 --> 3633.30]  the sea and all that is in them,
[3633.30 --> 3635.66]  but he rested on the seventh day.
[3636.44 --> 3637.74]  Therefore the Lord blessed
[3637.74 --> 3638.76]  the Sabbath day
[3638.76 --> 3639.92]  and made it holy.
[3641.64 --> 3642.98]  Honor your father
[3642.98 --> 3643.94]  and your mother
[3643.94 --> 3645.66]  so that you may live long
[3645.66 --> 3646.22]  in the land
[3646.22 --> 3647.14]  the Lord your God
[3647.14 --> 3647.80]  is giving you.
[3648.70 --> 3649.56]  You shall not murder,
[3650.22 --> 3651.84]  you shall not commit adultery,
[3652.10 --> 3653.34]  you shall not steal,
[3653.60 --> 3655.30]  you shall not give false testimony
[3655.30 --> 3656.34]  against your neighbor,
[3656.70 --> 3657.70]  you shall not covet
[3657.70 --> 3658.58]  your neighbor's house,
[3658.70 --> 3659.38]  you shall not covet
[3659.38 --> 3660.10]  your neighbor's wife
[3660.10 --> 3661.74]  or his male or female servant,
[3661.74 --> 3663.18]  his ox or donkey
[3663.18 --> 3663.88]  or anything
[3663.88 --> 3665.10]  that belongs
[3665.10 --> 3666.28]  to your neighbor.
[3668.16 --> 3669.38]  When the people saw
[3669.38 --> 3669.92]  the thunder
[3669.92 --> 3670.60]  and the lightning
[3670.60 --> 3671.50]  and heard the trumpet
[3671.50 --> 3672.44]  and saw the mountain
[3672.44 --> 3673.04]  in smoke,
[3673.16 --> 3674.66]  they trembled with fear.
[3675.72 --> 3677.16]  They stayed at a distance
[3677.16 --> 3679.58]  and said to Moses,
[3680.28 --> 3681.88]  Speak to us yourself
[3681.88 --> 3682.88]  and we will listen,
[3683.32 --> 3684.32]  but do not have God
[3684.32 --> 3685.02]  speak to us
[3685.02 --> 3685.84]  or we will die.
[3687.30 --> 3688.58]  Moses said to the people,
[3689.12 --> 3690.18]  Do not be afraid.
[3690.66 --> 3691.36]  God has come
[3691.36 --> 3692.12]  to test you
[3692.12 --> 3692.88]  so that the fear
[3692.88 --> 3693.36]  of God
[3693.36 --> 3694.20]  will be with you
[3694.20 --> 3695.18]  to keep you
[3695.18 --> 3695.82]  from sinning.
[3696.68 --> 3697.48]  And the people
[3697.48 --> 3698.74]  remained at a distance
[3698.74 --> 3699.48]  while Moses
[3699.48 --> 3700.10]  approached
[3700.10 --> 3702.42]  the thick darkness
[3702.42 --> 3703.36]  where God
[3703.36 --> 3704.28]  was.
[3705.34 --> 3706.16]  This is the word
[3706.16 --> 3706.58]  of the Lord.
[3710.36 --> 3710.88]  Now,
[3711.22 --> 3712.44]  this morning
[3712.44 --> 3713.54]  we're going
[3713.54 --> 3714.90]  to do
[3714.90 --> 3715.44]  the work
[3715.44 --> 3716.50]  of theology,
[3717.14 --> 3717.88]  of biblical
[3717.88 --> 3718.50]  and systematic
[3718.50 --> 3719.14]  theology
[3719.14 --> 3719.96]  this morning
[3719.96 --> 3720.64]  and so roll
[3720.64 --> 3721.32]  up your sleeves
[3721.32 --> 3722.48]  because we're
[3722.48 --> 3722.86]  going to dig
[3722.86 --> 3724.08]  in together.
[3724.54 --> 3724.64]  Now,
[3724.70 --> 3725.08]  don't worry,
[3725.20 --> 3726.40]  all good theology
[3726.40 --> 3728.28]  is practical theology
[3728.28 --> 3729.00]  and so we'll
[3729.00 --> 3729.62]  leave you with
[3729.62 --> 3730.22]  something there
[3730.22 --> 3731.06]  at the end.
[3733.12 --> 3734.10]  Like we said,
[3734.90 --> 3736.34]  everyone has
[3736.34 --> 3737.12]  an idea
[3737.12 --> 3738.56]  about what life
[3738.56 --> 3739.20]  is supposed
[3739.20 --> 3739.98]  to look like,
[3740.46 --> 3741.08]  about how we're
[3741.08 --> 3742.10]  supposed to live
[3742.10 --> 3744.58]  and for what goals
[3744.58 --> 3745.30]  or values
[3745.30 --> 3746.08]  we are supposed
[3746.08 --> 3746.46]  to live.
[3746.46 --> 3747.72]  And if you grew
[3747.72 --> 3748.46]  up Christian
[3748.46 --> 3749.84]  or if you grew
[3749.84 --> 3750.88]  up in a western
[3750.88 --> 3752.58]  country like Canada
[3752.58 --> 3754.08]  which has a history
[3754.08 --> 3755.46]  of being formed
[3755.46 --> 3757.16]  on Christian
[3757.16 --> 3758.66]  social values,
[3759.10 --> 3760.28]  these ten commandments
[3760.28 --> 3761.42]  are familiar
[3761.42 --> 3761.92]  to you.
[3763.54 --> 3764.90]  And for some,
[3765.66 --> 3766.50]  whether you are
[3766.50 --> 3768.04]  explicitly religious
[3768.04 --> 3768.92]  or not,
[3769.30 --> 3770.44]  the ten commandments
[3770.44 --> 3771.76]  sort of represent
[3771.76 --> 3772.68]  the pathway
[3772.68 --> 3773.36]  to heaven.
[3773.36 --> 3774.32]  Right?
[3774.40 --> 3775.34]  Just do these
[3775.34 --> 3776.38]  things and then
[3776.38 --> 3777.58]  when you die
[3777.58 --> 3778.34]  you'll go to heaven.
[3779.36 --> 3780.38]  For others,
[3780.84 --> 3781.92]  the ten commandments
[3781.92 --> 3782.88]  are just a good
[3782.88 --> 3784.16]  sort of recommendation
[3784.16 --> 3785.38]  about how you're
[3785.38 --> 3786.08]  supposed to live.
[3786.32 --> 3787.52]  At least the second
[3787.52 --> 3788.24]  half of the ten
[3788.24 --> 3788.90]  commandments are.
[3789.24 --> 3789.46]  Right?
[3789.48 --> 3790.00]  We can forget
[3790.00 --> 3790.82]  about the stuff
[3790.82 --> 3791.74]  about God
[3791.74 --> 3792.56]  and the Sabbath
[3792.56 --> 3793.46]  and all of that
[3793.46 --> 3793.94]  but that stuff
[3793.94 --> 3794.80]  about not murdering,
[3794.88 --> 3795.54]  that's pretty cool.
[3797.02 --> 3798.04]  And for others
[3798.04 --> 3799.76]  and increasingly so
[3799.76 --> 3800.94]  in our post-Christian
[3800.94 --> 3801.44]  world,
[3801.92 --> 3802.78]  the ten commandments
[3802.78 --> 3804.04]  and really any
[3804.04 --> 3805.30]  religious ethical
[3805.30 --> 3805.96]  instruction
[3805.96 --> 3807.76]  are to be cast off
[3807.76 --> 3808.64]  as the shackles
[3808.64 --> 3809.50]  that have hamstrung
[3809.50 --> 3810.00]  the progressive
[3810.00 --> 3810.54]  development
[3810.54 --> 3811.96]  and have oppressed
[3811.96 --> 3812.88]  whole portions
[3812.88 --> 3813.84]  of the world
[3813.84 --> 3814.78]  and subcultures
[3814.78 --> 3815.26]  within it.
[3817.00 --> 3818.00]  And in this latter
[3818.00 --> 3818.36]  case,
[3818.46 --> 3818.94]  to be sure,
[3819.10 --> 3820.18]  if you get on
[3820.18 --> 3820.88]  social media
[3820.88 --> 3821.72]  and you listen
[3821.72 --> 3822.48]  to all the
[3822.48 --> 3823.58]  so-called
[3823.58 --> 3824.78]  ex-evangelical
[3824.78 --> 3825.60]  stories of
[3825.60 --> 3826.26]  deconversion,
[3827.16 --> 3827.96]  now I realize
[3827.96 --> 3829.28]  that ex-evangelical
[3829.28 --> 3830.14]  might not be a word
[3830.14 --> 3830.56]  some of you
[3830.56 --> 3831.10]  are used to,
[3831.10 --> 3832.76]  but it's the idea
[3832.76 --> 3833.64]  that's really
[3833.64 --> 3835.54]  sort of in vogue
[3835.54 --> 3836.34]  in the social media
[3836.34 --> 3837.20]  world right now
[3837.20 --> 3837.80]  about people
[3837.80 --> 3838.54]  who grew up
[3838.54 --> 3839.58]  in a traditional
[3839.58 --> 3841.12]  evangelical context
[3841.12 --> 3842.64]  and have left it.
[3842.72 --> 3843.04]  They are
[3843.04 --> 3844.64]  ex-evangelical,
[3844.90 --> 3845.90]  ex-evangelical.
[3846.96 --> 3847.74]  And you hear
[3847.74 --> 3848.38]  those stories
[3848.38 --> 3850.24]  and the truth is,
[3850.28 --> 3851.14]  if I'm honest
[3851.14 --> 3852.54]  and clear,
[3852.70 --> 3853.50]  is that some
[3853.50 --> 3854.26]  of what they
[3854.26 --> 3854.90]  say
[3854.90 --> 3856.24]  isn't wrong
[3856.24 --> 3858.10]  because there
[3858.10 --> 3858.88]  is a whole
[3858.88 --> 3859.46]  culture
[3859.46 --> 3860.68]  of Christian
[3860.68 --> 3862.20]  that wields
[3862.20 --> 3862.84]  morality
[3862.84 --> 3863.90]  as a weapon.
[3865.22 --> 3866.00]  And there's
[3866.00 --> 3867.00]  a whole history
[3867.00 --> 3867.92]  of Western
[3867.92 --> 3868.76]  colonialism
[3868.76 --> 3870.08]  being wedded
[3870.08 --> 3871.00]  to the Christian
[3871.00 --> 3872.42]  mission of evangelism
[3872.42 --> 3873.28]  that is really
[3873.28 --> 3873.96]  just a thinly
[3873.96 --> 3874.70]  covered veil
[3874.70 --> 3875.36]  for the abuses
[3875.36 --> 3875.92]  of power.
[3877.26 --> 3878.26]  That's true.
[3879.12 --> 3879.62]  And we need
[3879.62 --> 3880.64]  to repent
[3880.64 --> 3881.82]  of our part
[3881.82 --> 3882.34]  in that
[3882.34 --> 3882.84]  or our
[3882.84 --> 3883.82]  perpetuation
[3883.82 --> 3884.84]  of that kind
[3884.84 --> 3885.26]  of system
[3885.26 --> 3885.84]  if we have
[3885.84 --> 3886.34]  done that.
[3886.98 --> 3887.72]  And we need
[3887.72 --> 3888.96]  to be so
[3888.96 --> 3890.22]  incredibly mindful
[3890.22 --> 3891.70]  of that temptation
[3891.70 --> 3892.84]  for power
[3892.84 --> 3894.26]  and privilege.
[3895.32 --> 3896.50]  But the question
[3896.50 --> 3897.78]  remains for us
[3897.78 --> 3898.30]  this morning,
[3898.54 --> 3898.68]  right?
[3898.76 --> 3899.68]  Utterly rejecting
[3899.68 --> 3901.74]  the past abuses
[3901.74 --> 3902.76]  and fleeing
[3902.76 --> 3903.58]  the temptation
[3903.58 --> 3904.56]  to weaponize
[3904.56 --> 3905.52]  morality,
[3906.16 --> 3906.96]  what role,
[3907.48 --> 3908.22]  if any,
[3908.96 --> 3909.72]  do the Ten
[3909.72 --> 3910.44]  Commandments
[3910.44 --> 3912.12]  play in defining
[3912.12 --> 3913.14]  what life is
[3913.14 --> 3913.92]  supposed to look
[3913.92 --> 3914.30]  like?
[3914.84 --> 3915.90]  For the Christian
[3915.90 --> 3917.44]  and then maybe
[3917.44 --> 3919.50]  for the non-Christian.
[3922.16 --> 3923.22]  Now before we can
[3923.22 --> 3923.70]  answer that
[3923.70 --> 3925.04]  bigger question,
[3925.32 --> 3925.80]  there's one that
[3925.80 --> 3926.30]  we need to
[3926.30 --> 3927.60]  start with
[3927.60 --> 3929.02]  and that is
[3929.02 --> 3930.02]  what is the
[3930.02 --> 3931.40]  best way
[3931.40 --> 3932.56]  to understand
[3932.56 --> 3933.90]  or to approach
[3933.90 --> 3935.38]  the Ten Commandments?
[3936.42 --> 3937.38]  Now this question
[3937.38 --> 3938.18]  may seem a little bit
[3938.18 --> 3939.22]  strange as a starting
[3939.22 --> 3939.72]  point because
[3939.72 --> 3940.36]  some of you
[3940.36 --> 3940.98]  might just say,
[3941.10 --> 3941.24]  well,
[3942.04 --> 3942.50]  can't we just
[3942.50 --> 3942.88]  read them?
[3943.62 --> 3944.42]  Can't we do them?
[3944.42 --> 3945.42]  Can't we just ask
[3945.42 --> 3946.48]  forgiveness when we
[3946.48 --> 3946.98]  screw up?
[3947.84 --> 3948.52]  What do we need a
[3948.52 --> 3949.50]  framework for
[3949.50 --> 3950.68]  for understanding?
[3950.92 --> 3951.78]  Just do what it
[3951.78 --> 3952.14]  says.
[3953.48 --> 3954.50]  Problem is,
[3954.58 --> 3955.10]  of course,
[3955.22 --> 3955.38]  right,
[3955.58 --> 3956.64]  that in the rest
[3956.64 --> 3957.38]  of our reading
[3957.38 --> 3958.10]  of the Bible
[3958.10 --> 3959.26]  we always
[3959.26 --> 3960.48]  use a framework,
[3961.02 --> 3961.20]  right?
[3961.22 --> 3961.96]  We always have
[3961.96 --> 3963.18]  what some people
[3963.18 --> 3964.32]  have called a lens,
[3964.48 --> 3965.18]  I wear glasses,
[3965.34 --> 3965.88]  a lens
[3965.88 --> 3967.04]  through which
[3967.04 --> 3967.80]  we look
[3967.80 --> 3969.22]  at the Bible
[3969.22 --> 3970.02]  and by which
[3970.02 --> 3971.04]  we read Scripture.
[3971.16 --> 3971.92]  Everyone does it.
[3971.92 --> 3973.12]  everyone has it.
[3973.90 --> 3974.90]  You just might not
[3974.90 --> 3975.82]  recognize it.
[3976.88 --> 3977.78]  Now in theology,
[3978.20 --> 3979.00]  what we call this
[3979.00 --> 3979.98]  is the issue
[3979.98 --> 3981.04]  of interpretation
[3981.04 --> 3982.84]  or the issue
[3982.84 --> 3984.20]  of hermeneutics.
[3985.42 --> 3985.90]  Now,
[3986.30 --> 3987.54]  I used that word
[3987.54 --> 3988.36]  one time before
[3988.36 --> 3989.16]  and someone said,
[3989.48 --> 3989.70]  you know,
[3989.82 --> 3990.14]  Pastor,
[3990.38 --> 3991.12]  I don't need a
[3991.12 --> 3991.84]  hermeneutic for
[3991.84 --> 3992.48]  reading the Bible,
[3992.74 --> 3993.74]  I just pick it up.
[3995.24 --> 3995.46]  I said,
[3995.50 --> 3995.62]  well,
[3995.66 --> 3996.08]  actually,
[3996.76 --> 3997.98]  that's not true
[3997.98 --> 3999.52]  and I know
[3999.52 --> 4000.44]  that that's not true
[4000.44 --> 4002.30]  because you still
[4002.30 --> 4003.44]  have your right hand
[4003.44 --> 4004.32]  and your right eye.
[4005.46 --> 4005.84]  This person
[4005.84 --> 4006.18]  looked at me
[4006.18 --> 4006.32]  and said,
[4006.40 --> 4006.58]  what?
[4007.14 --> 4007.34]  I said,
[4007.38 --> 4007.52]  well,
[4007.62 --> 4008.60]  in Matthew 5,
[4008.66 --> 4009.52]  verse 29 and 30,
[4009.62 --> 4010.26]  Jesus says,
[4010.62 --> 4011.38]  if your right eye
[4011.38 --> 4012.34]  causes you to sin,
[4013.62 --> 4014.28]  gouge it out,
[4014.86 --> 4015.44]  throw it away.
[4016.16 --> 4016.70]  For it's better
[4016.70 --> 4017.42]  for you to lose
[4017.42 --> 4018.36]  one part of your body
[4018.36 --> 4019.26]  than for your whole body
[4019.26 --> 4020.18]  to be thrown into hell.
[4020.52 --> 4021.50]  And if your right hand
[4021.50 --> 4022.44]  causes you to sin,
[4023.12 --> 4023.88]  cut it off
[4023.88 --> 4025.12]  and throw it away.
[4026.34 --> 4026.52]  Now,
[4026.52 --> 4027.42]  if she simply
[4027.42 --> 4028.50]  read the Bible
[4028.50 --> 4029.74]  and did what it said,
[4030.94 --> 4031.46]  she would be
[4031.46 --> 4032.38]  a half-blind cripple.
[4033.52 --> 4034.00]  But,
[4034.32 --> 4035.40]  we all have
[4035.40 --> 4036.12]  a hermeneutic.
[4037.38 --> 4038.28]  Here's another one.
[4038.90 --> 4039.52]  No less than
[4039.52 --> 4040.26]  four times
[4040.26 --> 4040.94]  in the New Testament,
[4041.06 --> 4041.74]  the Apostle Paul
[4041.74 --> 4042.58]  tells believers
[4042.58 --> 4044.42]  to greet each other
[4044.42 --> 4045.86]  with a holy kiss.
[4047.40 --> 4048.42]  When was the last time
[4048.42 --> 4049.18]  you did that in church?
[4050.86 --> 4051.26]  Surely,
[4051.38 --> 4052.30]  not in the last two years.
[4056.06 --> 4056.50]  Right?
[4056.52 --> 4057.12]  We all have
[4057.12 --> 4057.76]  a framework
[4057.76 --> 4059.14]  for understanding.
[4059.92 --> 4060.82]  What I hope
[4060.82 --> 4061.74]  to do with you
[4061.74 --> 4063.02]  quickly this morning
[4063.02 --> 4063.80]  is to come up
[4063.80 --> 4065.74]  with a shared framework.
[4066.64 --> 4067.12]  Because,
[4067.24 --> 4068.32]  having a framework
[4068.32 --> 4069.00]  for understanding
[4069.00 --> 4070.28]  is also true
[4070.28 --> 4071.52]  when we come
[4071.52 --> 4072.46]  to the Ten Commandments.
[4073.48 --> 4074.36]  For instance,
[4075.16 --> 4075.38]  right,
[4075.44 --> 4076.26]  the Second Commandment
[4076.26 --> 4076.56]  says,
[4076.64 --> 4077.34]  rather explicitly,
[4077.86 --> 4078.42]  you shall not
[4078.42 --> 4079.20]  make for yourself
[4079.20 --> 4079.70]  an image
[4079.70 --> 4080.16]  in the form
[4080.16 --> 4080.64]  of anything
[4080.64 --> 4081.54]  in heaven above
[4081.54 --> 4082.36]  or on the earth
[4082.36 --> 4082.76]  beneath
[4082.76 --> 4083.78]  or in the waters below.
[4083.78 --> 4085.64]  Now,
[4085.68 --> 4086.30]  does that refer
[4086.30 --> 4087.68]  to the idols
[4087.68 --> 4088.80]  of other gods
[4088.80 --> 4089.88]  that we're not
[4089.88 --> 4090.68]  supposed to have
[4090.68 --> 4091.48]  or does that refer
[4091.48 --> 4092.50]  to any image
[4092.50 --> 4094.08]  of the one true God?
[4094.18 --> 4094.76]  Does this refer
[4094.76 --> 4095.24]  to images
[4095.24 --> 4096.46]  of God himself?
[4096.64 --> 4097.48]  And if it does refer
[4097.48 --> 4097.90]  to images
[4097.90 --> 4098.56]  of God himself,
[4098.86 --> 4099.88]  in what way
[4099.88 --> 4100.80]  and how far?
[4101.18 --> 4101.34]  Right?
[4101.38 --> 4101.94]  Are we allowed
[4101.94 --> 4102.52]  to have pictures
[4102.52 --> 4102.98]  of Jesus
[4102.98 --> 4104.00]  in our children's Bibles?
[4105.10 --> 4105.26]  Right?
[4105.30 --> 4106.46]  Or if you're old enough,
[4106.98 --> 4108.26]  were we all sinning
[4108.26 --> 4109.42]  when the Sunday school teacher
[4109.42 --> 4110.04]  put Jesus
[4110.04 --> 4110.90]  on the felt board?
[4110.90 --> 4111.34]  Right?
[4112.56 --> 4113.52]  You remember felt boards?
[4115.56 --> 4117.14]  Or in the Fourth Commandment,
[4117.30 --> 4117.54]  right,
[4117.86 --> 4118.58]  we read,
[4118.98 --> 4119.96]  remember the Sabbath day
[4119.96 --> 4120.88]  by keeping it holy.
[4121.02 --> 4121.76]  The seventh day
[4121.76 --> 4122.36]  is a Sabbath
[4122.36 --> 4123.30]  to the Lord your God.
[4123.38 --> 4123.66]  On it,
[4123.70 --> 4124.82]  you shall not do any work.
[4125.74 --> 4126.56]  But what qualifies
[4126.56 --> 4127.04]  as work?
[4128.48 --> 4128.62]  Right?
[4128.64 --> 4129.12]  Am I allowed
[4129.12 --> 4130.24]  to go out for lunch
[4130.24 --> 4131.54]  after church
[4131.54 --> 4133.46]  because it's less work
[4133.46 --> 4134.32]  for me to go out
[4134.32 --> 4135.22]  and get lunch
[4135.22 --> 4136.04]  than it is to make it
[4136.04 --> 4136.28]  at home?
[4138.16 --> 4139.30]  Can I cut the grass?
[4139.30 --> 4141.12]  Can I weed the garden?
[4141.92 --> 4142.82]  Is that work?
[4143.74 --> 4144.24]  Am I allowed
[4144.24 --> 4145.06]  to play sports
[4145.06 --> 4145.72]  or games
[4145.72 --> 4147.06]  or, heaven forbid,
[4147.22 --> 4149.20]  cards on Sunday?
[4150.06 --> 4150.50]  Now, you laugh,
[4150.56 --> 4151.50]  but there was a time
[4151.50 --> 4152.70]  in our church's history
[4152.70 --> 4153.78]  where that was forbidden.
[4153.90 --> 4154.34]  Some of you
[4154.34 --> 4155.34]  might remember that.
[4156.62 --> 4156.74]  Right?
[4156.78 --> 4157.60]  The challenge
[4157.60 --> 4159.04]  of interpretation
[4159.04 --> 4160.44]  is raised
[4160.44 --> 4161.86]  and how we understand
[4161.86 --> 4162.52]  and apply
[4162.52 --> 4164.18]  is so important.
[4164.26 --> 4165.62]  And it comes up again
[4165.62 --> 4166.84]  in the time of Jesus.
[4167.90 --> 4168.08]  Right?
[4168.08 --> 4170.74]  So, as New Testament Christians,
[4171.68 --> 4172.30]  we want to look
[4172.30 --> 4173.18]  for a New Testament
[4173.18 --> 4174.26]  interpretation
[4174.26 --> 4175.92]  of the Old Testament
[4175.92 --> 4176.76]  as a guide
[4176.76 --> 4177.74]  for understanding
[4177.74 --> 4178.58]  scriptures.
[4178.80 --> 4179.40]  And in the Sermon
[4179.40 --> 4179.88]  on the Mount,
[4180.68 --> 4181.58]  Jesus says,
[4182.58 --> 4183.16]  do not think
[4183.16 --> 4183.76]  that I have come
[4183.76 --> 4184.60]  to abolish
[4184.60 --> 4185.06]  the law
[4185.06 --> 4185.82]  and the prophets.
[4186.30 --> 4186.86]  I've not come
[4186.86 --> 4187.94]  to abolish them,
[4188.12 --> 4189.56]  but to fulfill them.
[4190.88 --> 4191.10]  And so,
[4191.16 --> 4192.14]  what does fulfill mean
[4192.14 --> 4193.06]  in that moment?
[4194.58 --> 4194.72]  Right?
[4194.74 --> 4196.46]  There's a commentator
[4196.46 --> 4197.38]  named Dale Bruner.
[4197.50 --> 4198.10]  I like he has
[4198.10 --> 4199.22]  a play on words here.
[4199.96 --> 4200.60]  He says that
[4200.60 --> 4201.62]  Jesus comes
[4201.62 --> 4203.32]  to fulfill the law
[4203.32 --> 4205.26]  in that he keeps it perfectly,
[4205.58 --> 4207.04]  but also in that
[4207.04 --> 4208.54]  he fills it up
[4208.54 --> 4210.78]  with new meaning for us.
[4211.84 --> 4212.44]  And so,
[4212.50 --> 4213.28]  that's why the command
[4213.28 --> 4214.20]  to not murder
[4214.20 --> 4215.58]  is also including
[4215.58 --> 4216.42]  hatred
[4216.42 --> 4217.72]  of your brother and sister.
[4217.84 --> 4218.76]  He fills it up
[4218.76 --> 4219.90]  with a new meaning for us.
[4219.90 --> 4221.50]  And in looking
[4221.50 --> 4222.12]  to Jesus
[4222.12 --> 4223.18]  and the other
[4223.18 --> 4224.36]  New Testament passages
[4224.36 --> 4225.40]  that we begin
[4225.40 --> 4226.44]  to develop then
[4226.44 --> 4227.94]  our shared framework
[4227.94 --> 4228.98]  for understanding
[4228.98 --> 4230.06]  how we are supposed
[4230.06 --> 4231.24]  to approach
[4231.24 --> 4232.40]  and apply
[4232.40 --> 4233.84]  the law of God
[4233.84 --> 4234.90]  in Exodus 20.
[4236.08 --> 4237.08]  For example,
[4237.42 --> 4237.60]  right,
[4237.66 --> 4237.90]  again,
[4237.98 --> 4238.94]  on the Sabbath question,
[4239.34 --> 4240.04]  what does it mean
[4240.04 --> 4241.68]  when Jesus says
[4241.68 --> 4242.90]  Sabbath was made
[4242.90 --> 4243.54]  for people,
[4243.72 --> 4244.40]  not people
[4244.40 --> 4245.16]  for the Sabbath?
[4246.04 --> 4246.58]  Or,
[4246.66 --> 4247.12]  what does it mean
[4247.12 --> 4248.12]  in the book of Hebrews
[4248.12 --> 4249.04]  when it talks about
[4249.04 --> 4250.18]  Jesus himself
[4250.18 --> 4251.74]  as being the
[4251.74 --> 4252.54]  sort of
[4252.54 --> 4254.02]  fulfillment
[4254.02 --> 4255.82]  of the Sabbath rest
[4255.82 --> 4257.42]  that we were promised
[4257.42 --> 4258.14]  and that we all need
[4258.14 --> 4259.08]  to be found in him,
[4259.72 --> 4259.98]  right?
[4260.04 --> 4261.02]  Meaning that Sabbath
[4261.02 --> 4262.68]  is a seven-day-a-week
[4262.68 --> 4263.86]  spiritual reality,
[4263.86 --> 4265.52]  not just a working
[4265.52 --> 4266.52]  or a stopping
[4266.52 --> 4267.38]  your work
[4267.38 --> 4268.50]  physical reality.
[4269.56 --> 4270.46]  At least that's
[4270.46 --> 4270.88]  the framework.
[4272.26 --> 4272.44]  And so,
[4272.52 --> 4273.44]  as we ask the question
[4273.44 --> 4274.22]  of framework,
[4274.40 --> 4275.24]  as we ask this question
[4275.24 --> 4276.32]  of hermeneutics,
[4276.32 --> 4278.16]  it's an issue
[4278.16 --> 4279.98]  of focus,
[4280.20 --> 4280.52]  really.
[4281.92 --> 4282.84]  Which is why,
[4282.96 --> 4283.72]  in this,
[4283.78 --> 4284.36]  we have to ask
[4284.36 --> 4285.84]  another question.
[4286.72 --> 4287.36]  And that question
[4287.36 --> 4287.56]  is,
[4287.74 --> 4289.00]  who are the
[4289.00 --> 4289.90]  Ten Commandments
[4289.90 --> 4291.24]  really about?
[4291.40 --> 4291.56]  Or,
[4291.66 --> 4293.10]  for whom
[4293.10 --> 4294.20]  are they
[4294.20 --> 4295.14]  given?
[4296.10 --> 4296.56]  Now,
[4296.60 --> 4296.74]  again,
[4296.80 --> 4297.28]  maybe you think
[4297.28 --> 4298.24]  the answer is obvious,
[4298.36 --> 4298.52]  right?
[4298.52 --> 4300.48]  The Ten Commandments
[4300.48 --> 4301.36]  answer the question,
[4301.68 --> 4302.76]  how shall we live?
[4303.10 --> 4303.50]  And so,
[4303.64 --> 4304.36]  by implication,
[4304.66 --> 4305.58]  they are for
[4305.58 --> 4306.46]  humans,
[4306.78 --> 4307.98]  for and about
[4307.98 --> 4308.60]  humans,
[4308.74 --> 4309.24]  they are about
[4309.24 --> 4310.08]  us.
[4311.26 --> 4311.78]  And yet,
[4312.56 --> 4314.28]  in the story,
[4314.38 --> 4314.84]  as we have been
[4314.84 --> 4315.24]  reading it,
[4315.30 --> 4316.06]  where do we find
[4316.06 --> 4317.22]  the law given?
[4319.44 --> 4320.56]  Not just on the
[4320.56 --> 4321.36]  mountainside
[4321.36 --> 4322.18]  at Sinai,
[4323.02 --> 4323.46]  but,
[4323.62 --> 4324.16]  more generally,
[4324.96 --> 4325.76]  in the Bible.
[4326.76 --> 4327.84]  The Bible,
[4328.20 --> 4329.64]  which we say,
[4329.84 --> 4331.56]  as Reformed Christians,
[4331.74 --> 4332.80]  as Protestant Christians,
[4332.80 --> 4333.84]  as Christians
[4333.84 --> 4335.36]  throughout time and space,
[4335.56 --> 4336.90]  Catholic through it all,
[4337.12 --> 4338.42]  we say that the Bible
[4338.42 --> 4339.36]  is the true
[4339.36 --> 4340.64]  and authoritative
[4340.64 --> 4341.38]  revelation
[4341.38 --> 4341.98]  of
[4341.98 --> 4343.50]  God.
[4344.94 --> 4345.54]  The
[4345.54 --> 4346.32]  Belgic
[4346.32 --> 4346.98]  Confession,
[4347.74 --> 4348.40]  the Belgic
[4348.40 --> 4348.86]  Confession
[4348.86 --> 4350.24]  is a
[4350.24 --> 4351.50]  statement
[4351.50 --> 4352.22]  of faith
[4352.22 --> 4353.16]  that our
[4353.16 --> 4353.54]  church
[4353.54 --> 4354.10]  and other
[4354.10 --> 4354.74]  Continental
[4354.74 --> 4356.00]  Reformed churches
[4356.00 --> 4356.72]  have held up
[4356.72 --> 4358.00]  as a good summary
[4358.00 --> 4359.40]  of the teachings
[4359.40 --> 4359.96]  of the Bible.
[4359.96 --> 4360.46]  The Belgic
[4360.46 --> 4361.02]  Confession
[4361.02 --> 4363.00]  asks and says
[4363.00 --> 4363.58]  in an article
[4363.58 --> 4364.02]  called
[4364.02 --> 4364.46]  The Means
[4364.46 --> 4365.06]  By Which We
[4365.06 --> 4365.60]  Know God,
[4365.92 --> 4366.38]  says,
[4366.60 --> 4367.34]  we know God
[4367.34 --> 4368.74]  by two means.
[4369.28 --> 4369.60]  First,
[4369.98 --> 4370.84]  by the creation
[4370.84 --> 4371.46]  and preservation
[4371.46 --> 4372.32]  and government
[4372.32 --> 4373.06]  of the universe,
[4373.38 --> 4374.04]  and second,
[4374.36 --> 4375.34]  he makes himself
[4375.34 --> 4376.44]  known to us
[4376.44 --> 4377.28]  more openly
[4377.28 --> 4379.02]  by his holy
[4379.02 --> 4380.30]  and divine
[4380.30 --> 4381.52]  word.
[4382.16 --> 4383.16]  The Bible
[4383.16 --> 4384.14]  is the
[4384.14 --> 4385.22]  holy word
[4385.22 --> 4385.60]  of God.
[4385.68 --> 4386.12]  It is a
[4386.12 --> 4386.80]  revelation
[4386.80 --> 4387.72]  of who
[4387.72 --> 4388.38]  God
[4388.38 --> 4389.04]  is.
[4389.46 --> 4390.04]  First and
[4390.04 --> 4390.54]  foremost,
[4390.74 --> 4390.92]  then,
[4391.00 --> 4391.50]  the Bible,
[4391.92 --> 4392.56]  all of the
[4392.56 --> 4392.88]  Bible,
[4393.18 --> 4393.88]  is not a
[4393.88 --> 4394.56]  road map
[4394.56 --> 4395.58]  for how we
[4395.58 --> 4396.04]  are supposed
[4396.04 --> 4396.46]  to live
[4396.46 --> 4396.90]  our best
[4396.90 --> 4397.60]  lives now.
[4398.68 --> 4399.46]  It's the
[4399.46 --> 4399.98]  way that
[4399.98 --> 4400.48]  God has
[4400.48 --> 4401.34]  chosen to
[4401.34 --> 4402.36]  reveal himself
[4402.36 --> 4403.30]  to you
[4403.30 --> 4404.78]  and to
[4404.78 --> 4405.16]  us.
[4406.56 --> 4407.32]  And so,
[4407.44 --> 4407.92]  since that
[4407.92 --> 4408.52]  is true
[4408.52 --> 4409.28]  generally,
[4409.80 --> 4410.96]  it must also
[4410.96 --> 4411.58]  be true
[4411.58 --> 4412.78]  specifically.
[4413.44 --> 4414.12]  That is,
[4414.20 --> 4414.88]  it must also
[4414.88 --> 4415.36]  be true
[4415.36 --> 4415.86]  of the
[4415.86 --> 4417.12]  Ten Commandments.
[4418.40 --> 4418.88]  And sure,
[4419.00 --> 4419.40]  it's true
[4419.40 --> 4419.76]  that the
[4419.76 --> 4420.50]  laws here
[4420.50 --> 4422.06]  reflect the
[4422.06 --> 4422.88]  ways of
[4422.88 --> 4423.86]  God's people
[4423.86 --> 4424.78]  to be marked
[4424.78 --> 4425.40]  out as
[4425.40 --> 4426.04]  holy,
[4426.58 --> 4428.34]  but only
[4428.34 --> 4429.34]  because
[4429.34 --> 4431.32]  he is
[4431.32 --> 4432.42]  holy.
[4434.00 --> 4434.64]  The Ten
[4434.64 --> 4435.30]  Commandments
[4435.30 --> 4436.20]  show us,
[4436.38 --> 4436.76]  first,
[4437.10 --> 4437.80]  something of
[4437.80 --> 4438.26]  the very
[4438.26 --> 4439.46]  person and
[4439.46 --> 4440.50]  nature of
[4440.50 --> 4441.10]  God.
[4441.52 --> 4442.30]  They reveal
[4442.30 --> 4443.58]  his heart.
[4443.58 --> 4443.62]  God.
[4445.06 --> 4446.08]  As Peter
[4446.08 --> 4446.46]  ends,
[4446.66 --> 4446.94]  says,
[4447.32 --> 4447.82]  we see
[4447.82 --> 4448.46]  in them
[4448.46 --> 4448.90]  the Ten
[4448.90 --> 4449.46]  Commandments
[4449.46 --> 4450.20]  not simply
[4450.20 --> 4450.68]  what we
[4450.68 --> 4451.38]  must do,
[4451.72 --> 4452.34]  but what
[4452.34 --> 4453.96]  God is
[4453.96 --> 4454.80]  like.
[4456.60 --> 4457.08]  And so,
[4457.64 --> 4458.44]  as a
[4458.44 --> 4458.96]  foundational
[4458.96 --> 4459.96]  part of
[4459.96 --> 4461.02]  our shared
[4461.02 --> 4461.88]  framework for
[4461.88 --> 4462.56]  understanding
[4462.56 --> 4463.66]  the Torah,
[4464.08 --> 4464.74]  the Ten
[4464.74 --> 4465.40]  Commandments,
[4465.78 --> 4466.40]  we must
[4466.40 --> 4467.84]  start with
[4467.84 --> 4468.44]  this as a
[4468.44 --> 4469.46]  revelation of
[4469.46 --> 4470.14]  who God
[4470.14 --> 4471.00]  is.
[4471.40 --> 4471.98]  And really
[4471.98 --> 4472.82]  only from
[4472.82 --> 4473.92]  that point
[4473.92 --> 4474.52]  of reference
[4474.52 --> 4474.96]  can we
[4474.96 --> 4475.52]  begin to
[4475.52 --> 4476.48]  understand why
[4476.48 --> 4477.14]  people
[4477.14 --> 4478.56]  themselves are
[4478.56 --> 4479.66]  called to
[4479.66 --> 4480.38]  live by them.
[4480.96 --> 4481.56]  Which then
[4481.56 --> 4482.52]  brings us to
[4482.52 --> 4483.36]  our second
[4483.36 --> 4483.80]  sort of
[4483.80 --> 4484.50]  overarching
[4484.50 --> 4485.10]  question,
[4485.62 --> 4486.60]  which is
[4486.60 --> 4487.78]  how do
[4487.78 --> 4488.18]  the Ten
[4488.18 --> 4488.82]  Commandments
[4488.82 --> 4489.88]  impact or
[4489.88 --> 4490.96]  guide Christian
[4490.96 --> 4491.42]  living,
[4491.98 --> 4493.14]  if at all?
[4494.48 --> 4494.80]  Now,
[4494.82 --> 4495.26]  this answer is
[4495.26 --> 4495.54]  going to be a
[4495.54 --> 4495.78]  little bit
[4495.78 --> 4496.08]  quicker,
[4497.00 --> 4498.60]  and yet it is
[4498.60 --> 4499.22]  the scope
[4499.22 --> 4499.76]  or the
[4499.76 --> 4500.24]  practical
[4500.24 --> 4500.94]  implication
[4500.94 --> 4502.22]  of each
[4502.22 --> 4503.12]  command that
[4503.12 --> 4503.64]  has been the
[4503.64 --> 4504.44]  cause of so
[4504.44 --> 4505.68]  much argument
[4505.68 --> 4506.46]  or division
[4506.46 --> 4507.12]  within Christian
[4507.12 --> 4508.18]  families and
[4508.18 --> 4509.60]  circles that
[4509.60 --> 4510.00]  it will work
[4510.00 --> 4510.72]  itself out in,
[4510.80 --> 4511.44]  and you are
[4511.44 --> 4512.00]  invited to
[4512.00 --> 4512.64]  think about
[4512.64 --> 4513.28]  that and to
[4513.28 --> 4514.06]  prayerfully wrestle
[4514.06 --> 4514.48]  with that
[4514.48 --> 4515.36]  through the week,
[4515.46 --> 4516.36]  but really you
[4516.36 --> 4516.96]  only have to
[4516.96 --> 4517.46]  try and tell
[4517.46 --> 4518.20]  your kids that
[4518.20 --> 4518.92]  they can't go
[4518.92 --> 4519.40]  out on a
[4519.40 --> 4519.88]  warm Sunday
[4519.88 --> 4520.42]  afternoon and
[4520.42 --> 4520.94]  play soccer
[4520.94 --> 4522.70]  because it's
[4522.70 --> 4523.12]  the Sabbath.
[4523.70 --> 4523.90]  Well,
[4523.94 --> 4524.50]  actually it's
[4524.50 --> 4525.36]  the Lord's
[4525.36 --> 4525.56]  Day,
[4526.22 --> 4526.66]  which isn't
[4526.66 --> 4527.06]  the Sabbath
[4527.06 --> 4527.48]  because that
[4527.48 --> 4528.04]  was Saturday,
[4528.04 --> 4528.92]  but you see
[4528.92 --> 4529.24]  we're getting
[4529.24 --> 4529.68]  into another
[4529.68 --> 4530.34]  question of
[4530.34 --> 4531.22]  hermeneutics
[4531.22 --> 4532.04]  again and
[4532.04 --> 4532.30]  why.
[4533.88 --> 4534.98]  Or you can
[4534.98 --> 4535.46]  come by my
[4535.46 --> 4535.88]  house later
[4535.88 --> 4536.40]  today when I'm
[4536.40 --> 4536.74]  cutting the
[4536.74 --> 4537.22]  grass and you
[4537.22 --> 4537.74]  can see all
[4537.74 --> 4538.60]  the stares of
[4538.60 --> 4539.28]  my neighbors
[4539.28 --> 4540.40]  who are like,
[4540.48 --> 4540.96]  isn't that the
[4540.96 --> 4542.62]  pastor cutting
[4542.62 --> 4543.40]  his grass on
[4543.40 --> 4543.84]  Sunday?
[4544.94 --> 4545.46]  If you know
[4545.46 --> 4545.80]  the neighborhood
[4545.80 --> 4546.26]  I live in,
[4546.30 --> 4546.66]  you know why
[4546.66 --> 4547.20]  that is the
[4547.20 --> 4547.40]  case.
[4550.80 --> 4551.20]  Now,
[4551.24 --> 4551.92]  perhaps we
[4551.92 --> 4552.30]  need to
[4552.30 --> 4553.02]  reframe the
[4553.02 --> 4554.74]  question by
[4554.74 --> 4556.28]  asking why
[4556.28 --> 4556.94]  do the Ten
[4556.94 --> 4557.64]  Commandments
[4557.64 --> 4558.72]  impact Christian
[4558.72 --> 4559.56]  living?
[4560.94 --> 4561.48]  Now,
[4561.50 --> 4561.82]  to answer
[4561.82 --> 4562.10]  that,
[4562.86 --> 4563.40]  look at
[4563.40 --> 4564.84]  the prologue
[4564.84 --> 4565.16]  to the
[4565.16 --> 4565.48]  commandments
[4565.48 --> 4566.00]  themselves.
[4566.12 --> 4566.68]  Verse 2
[4566.68 --> 4568.44]  of chapter 20.
[4568.54 --> 4569.02]  Verse 2
[4569.02 --> 4570.36]  introduces the
[4570.36 --> 4571.28]  law by
[4571.28 --> 4572.54]  introducing God.
[4573.32 --> 4573.48]  Right?
[4573.60 --> 4574.44]  I am the
[4574.44 --> 4574.96]  Lord your
[4574.96 --> 4575.50]  God who
[4575.50 --> 4576.18]  brought you
[4576.18 --> 4576.92]  out of
[4576.92 --> 4577.24]  Egypt,
[4577.44 --> 4578.24]  out of
[4578.24 --> 4578.72]  the land
[4578.72 --> 4580.02]  of slavery.
[4580.48 --> 4581.44]  These words
[4581.44 --> 4582.26]  set up for
[4582.26 --> 4582.78]  us the
[4582.78 --> 4584.80]  mental context,
[4585.20 --> 4585.98]  the frame of
[4585.98 --> 4586.80]  mind from
[4586.80 --> 4587.96]  which all
[4587.96 --> 4588.64]  the commandments
[4588.64 --> 4589.36]  following them
[4589.36 --> 4590.12]  should be
[4590.12 --> 4590.42]  viewed.
[4591.26 --> 4591.38]  Right?
[4591.46 --> 4591.98]  These words
[4591.98 --> 4592.70]  remind us
[4592.70 --> 4593.50]  that God,
[4593.88 --> 4594.34]  Yahweh,
[4594.50 --> 4595.14]  the Lord,
[4595.64 --> 4596.68]  is God.
[4596.80 --> 4597.36]  He is
[4597.36 --> 4597.94]  Yahweh,
[4598.08 --> 4598.58]  he is
[4598.58 --> 4599.34]  the Lord,
[4599.34 --> 4599.64]  and it
[4599.64 --> 4600.30]  reminds the
[4600.30 --> 4600.94]  hearers,
[4601.28 --> 4602.06]  first Israel
[4602.06 --> 4602.42]  in that
[4602.42 --> 4602.66]  moment,
[4602.74 --> 4603.34]  and now us,
[4603.68 --> 4604.42]  what he
[4604.42 --> 4605.62]  has done.
[4606.28 --> 4606.46]  Right?
[4606.50 --> 4607.08]  That God
[4607.08 --> 4607.66]  has brought
[4607.66 --> 4608.68]  Israel out
[4608.68 --> 4609.26]  of Egypt,
[4609.44 --> 4610.26]  that God
[4610.26 --> 4610.96]  has carried
[4610.96 --> 4612.38]  them through
[4612.38 --> 4613.44]  the Sea of
[4613.44 --> 4613.74]  breeds,
[4613.82 --> 4614.24]  that God
[4614.24 --> 4614.84]  has brought
[4614.84 --> 4615.64]  them the
[4615.64 --> 4616.78]  victory of
[4616.78 --> 4617.36]  the Exodus,
[4617.58 --> 4617.76]  that he
[4617.76 --> 4618.56]  has spared
[4618.56 --> 4619.44]  them as
[4619.44 --> 4619.72]  they took
[4619.72 --> 4620.96]  refuge under
[4620.96 --> 4621.44]  the blood
[4621.44 --> 4622.00]  of the Lamb.
[4623.14 --> 4623.60]  Remember,
[4624.62 --> 4625.16]  as we have
[4625.16 --> 4625.60]  looked at
[4625.60 --> 4626.40]  this book
[4626.40 --> 4627.00]  of Exodus,
[4627.30 --> 4627.70]  we have
[4627.70 --> 4628.24]  seen how
[4628.24 --> 4628.66]  each of
[4628.66 --> 4629.70]  these instances
[4629.70 --> 4630.58]  and stories
[4630.58 --> 4631.12]  is a
[4631.12 --> 4632.30]  microcosm
[4632.30 --> 4633.20]  of God's
[4633.20 --> 4633.74]  grand
[4633.74 --> 4634.34]  redemption
[4634.34 --> 4635.14]  plan for
[4635.14 --> 4635.56]  the world.
[4636.02 --> 4636.06]  Right?
[4636.12 --> 4636.78]  The battle
[4636.78 --> 4637.74]  between Pharaoh
[4637.74 --> 4638.78]  and the gods
[4638.78 --> 4639.34]  of Egypt
[4639.34 --> 4640.02]  is a battle
[4640.02 --> 4640.88]  that represents
[4640.88 --> 4641.72]  the final
[4641.72 --> 4642.40]  battle between
[4642.40 --> 4643.42]  God and Satan,
[4643.56 --> 4644.58]  God and sin.
[4644.70 --> 4645.00]  And so,
[4645.12 --> 4646.16]  just as God,
[4646.50 --> 4646.88]  Yahweh,
[4646.98 --> 4647.42]  the Lord,
[4647.52 --> 4648.00]  has brought
[4648.00 --> 4648.96]  Israel out
[4648.96 --> 4649.66]  of slavery,
[4649.94 --> 4650.86]  he, God,
[4650.94 --> 4651.40]  the Lord,
[4651.48 --> 4652.00]  and Jesus
[4652.00 --> 4652.84]  brought us,
[4652.98 --> 4653.54]  by grace
[4653.54 --> 4654.20]  through faith,
[4654.48 --> 4655.40]  out of slavery
[4655.40 --> 4656.10]  to sin.
[4656.60 --> 4657.62]  And just as God
[4657.62 --> 4658.56]  carried Israel
[4658.56 --> 4659.40]  through the Sea
[4659.40 --> 4659.96]  of Reeds
[4659.96 --> 4660.58]  and brought
[4660.58 --> 4661.28]  them victory,
[4661.44 --> 4662.16]  he, God,
[4662.26 --> 4662.70]  the Lord,
[4662.88 --> 4663.16]  Jesus,
[4663.32 --> 4663.80]  has carried
[4663.80 --> 4664.94]  us through
[4664.94 --> 4665.72]  in baptism
[4665.72 --> 4666.42]  and granted
[4666.42 --> 4667.46]  us victory
[4667.46 --> 4668.46]  over sin
[4668.46 --> 4669.34]  and death.
[4669.34 --> 4673.04]  point being,
[4673.76 --> 4674.48]  by the time
[4674.48 --> 4674.94]  we get
[4674.94 --> 4675.64]  to Exodus
[4675.64 --> 4676.58]  20,
[4676.70 --> 4677.30]  by the time
[4677.30 --> 4677.70]  we get
[4677.70 --> 4678.30]  to the giving
[4678.30 --> 4679.24]  of the law,
[4679.80 --> 4680.16]  God's
[4680.16 --> 4681.04]  relationship
[4681.04 --> 4681.80]  with his
[4681.80 --> 4682.50]  people
[4682.50 --> 4684.02]  has already
[4684.02 --> 4685.28]  been established.
[4686.72 --> 4687.70]  And so,
[4687.90 --> 4688.92]  I believe
[4688.92 --> 4689.40]  it would be
[4689.40 --> 4690.00]  a mistake
[4690.00 --> 4690.62]  for us
[4690.62 --> 4691.58]  to conclude
[4691.58 --> 4692.32]  that the law
[4692.32 --> 4693.14]  functions for
[4693.14 --> 4693.64]  Israel
[4693.64 --> 4694.76]  as a way
[4694.76 --> 4695.62]  of establishing
[4695.62 --> 4696.54]  or maintaining
[4696.54 --> 4697.38]  or making
[4697.38 --> 4698.64]  a relationship
[4698.64 --> 4699.72]  with God.
[4700.94 --> 4701.20]  Right?
[4701.24 --> 4702.04]  That began
[4702.04 --> 4702.62]  already
[4702.62 --> 4703.10]  with his
[4703.10 --> 4704.06]  gracious actions
[4704.06 --> 4705.10]  towards them
[4705.10 --> 4705.70]  and choosing
[4705.70 --> 4706.22]  them.
[4706.50 --> 4706.62]  Right?
[4706.64 --> 4706.98]  That began
[4706.98 --> 4707.88]  already in God
[4707.88 --> 4708.76]  calling out
[4708.76 --> 4709.84]  and selecting
[4709.84 --> 4710.38]  Abraham
[4710.38 --> 4711.14]  and promising
[4711.14 --> 4711.66]  that he would
[4711.66 --> 4712.04]  make him
[4712.04 --> 4713.30]  a great nation.
[4713.68 --> 4714.96]  God reiterated
[4714.96 --> 4715.74]  that and renewed
[4715.74 --> 4716.42]  that promise
[4716.42 --> 4717.18]  in the Acts
[4717.18 --> 4718.10]  of Exodus
[4718.10 --> 4718.96]  already.
[4719.62 --> 4719.76]  Now,
[4720.46 --> 4721.00]  if you know
[4721.00 --> 4721.48]  your Bible
[4721.48 --> 4722.04]  history,
[4722.48 --> 4723.80]  it is true
[4723.80 --> 4724.86]  that in time
[4724.86 --> 4726.28]  it may have
[4726.28 --> 4727.04]  come to be
[4727.04 --> 4727.60]  the case
[4727.60 --> 4728.28]  that the people
[4728.28 --> 4728.80]  understood
[4728.80 --> 4729.46]  that it was
[4729.46 --> 4730.76]  by obeying
[4730.76 --> 4731.16]  the law
[4731.16 --> 4731.72]  they entered
[4731.72 --> 4732.54]  into relationship
[4732.54 --> 4733.08]  with God.
[4733.18 --> 4733.84]  The Pharisees
[4733.84 --> 4734.88]  in the New Testament
[4734.88 --> 4735.96]  seem to make
[4735.96 --> 4736.50]  that clear
[4736.50 --> 4737.02]  that that is
[4737.02 --> 4737.48]  the case
[4737.48 --> 4737.72]  and the
[4737.72 --> 4738.20]  conversations
[4738.20 --> 4739.00]  that the
[4739.00 --> 4739.34]  apostles
[4739.34 --> 4740.02]  have to have
[4740.02 --> 4740.72]  in the New Testament
[4740.72 --> 4741.56]  era seem
[4741.56 --> 4741.92]  to make
[4741.92 --> 4742.38]  that is the
[4742.38 --> 4742.60]  case.
[4742.94 --> 4743.38]  But in
[4743.38 --> 4744.30]  its giving
[4744.30 --> 4745.34]  that is in
[4745.34 --> 4746.20]  here in Exodus
[4746.20 --> 4747.36]  20 as an
[4747.36 --> 4748.46]  extension of
[4748.46 --> 4748.96]  the law
[4748.96 --> 4749.50]  being a
[4749.50 --> 4750.40]  revelation of
[4750.40 --> 4750.90]  God,
[4751.38 --> 4751.88]  the law
[4751.88 --> 4752.60]  is an
[4752.60 --> 4753.26]  act of
[4753.26 --> 4754.22]  responding
[4754.22 --> 4755.46]  to Israel
[4755.46 --> 4756.38]  being chosen
[4756.38 --> 4757.44]  of God.
[4759.14 --> 4760.02]  I suggest
[4760.02 --> 4760.18]  to you
[4760.18 --> 4760.52]  the same
[4760.52 --> 4760.82]  is true
[4760.82 --> 4761.36]  for us.
[4762.06 --> 4762.66]  The law
[4762.66 --> 4763.24]  is about
[4763.24 --> 4764.04]  God choosing
[4764.04 --> 4765.22]  us and
[4765.22 --> 4766.32]  us responding
[4766.32 --> 4767.22]  in a manner
[4767.22 --> 4768.30]  appropriate
[4768.30 --> 4769.18]  to the one
[4769.18 --> 4769.56]  who has
[4769.56 --> 4770.28]  chosen us.
[4771.20 --> 4771.92]  The law
[4771.92 --> 4772.30]  then,
[4772.46 --> 4772.96]  from its
[4772.96 --> 4773.68]  inception,
[4774.12 --> 4775.44]  is created
[4775.44 --> 4777.12]  and given
[4777.12 --> 4778.86]  in grace.
[4779.88 --> 4780.60]  It is based
[4780.60 --> 4781.64]  on God's
[4781.64 --> 4782.52]  saving work
[4782.52 --> 4783.44]  and they,
[4783.68 --> 4784.28]  now we,
[4784.76 --> 4785.92]  receive rules
[4785.92 --> 4786.54]  for holy
[4786.54 --> 4787.26]  living because
[4787.26 --> 4787.92]  these rules
[4787.92 --> 4788.66]  reflect the
[4788.66 --> 4789.22]  one who has
[4789.22 --> 4790.04]  saved us.
[4790.80 --> 4791.06]  And by
[4791.06 --> 4791.74]  following the
[4791.74 --> 4792.38]  rule of life
[4792.38 --> 4793.18]  given by God
[4793.18 --> 4794.12]  in gratitude
[4794.12 --> 4794.92]  now for what
[4794.92 --> 4795.66]  he has done,
[4796.10 --> 4797.02]  we are becoming
[4797.02 --> 4797.88]  who he has
[4797.88 --> 4799.02]  set us apart
[4799.02 --> 4800.40]  to be by
[4800.40 --> 4801.04]  grace through
[4801.04 --> 4801.40]  faith.
[4803.40 --> 4803.96]  Simply,
[4804.18 --> 4804.94]  because Jesus
[4804.94 --> 4805.82]  lived the life
[4805.82 --> 4806.44]  I should have
[4806.44 --> 4807.62]  lived and the
[4807.62 --> 4808.26]  law proves that
[4808.26 --> 4808.92]  I don't,
[4809.12 --> 4809.90]  and because Jesus
[4809.90 --> 4810.76]  died the death
[4810.76 --> 4811.76]  that I deserve,
[4811.90 --> 4812.52]  the just
[4812.52 --> 4813.22]  punishment for
[4813.22 --> 4813.76]  sin that the
[4813.76 --> 4814.42]  law defines,
[4814.50 --> 4815.16]  for the wages
[4815.16 --> 4816.30]  of sin is
[4816.30 --> 4816.62]  death.
[4816.82 --> 4817.84]  Because he did
[4817.84 --> 4818.16]  that,
[4818.26 --> 4819.90]  I now can,
[4820.04 --> 4820.92]  we now
[4820.92 --> 4821.94]  together can,
[4822.10 --> 4822.96]  live in
[4822.96 --> 4823.78]  gratitude.
[4824.80 --> 4825.62]  The law that
[4825.62 --> 4826.52]  once condemned
[4826.52 --> 4827.62]  me is now
[4827.62 --> 4828.64]  the rule of
[4828.64 --> 4829.68]  my thanksgiving.
[4832.22 --> 4832.76]  The Heidelberg
[4832.76 --> 4833.92]  Catechism is
[4833.92 --> 4834.36]  another one of
[4834.36 --> 4835.26]  those documents
[4835.26 --> 4836.34]  that our church
[4836.34 --> 4837.86]  has used as
[4837.86 --> 4838.90]  a summary of
[4838.90 --> 4840.12]  teachings of
[4840.12 --> 4840.52]  the Bible.
[4841.40 --> 4841.76]  If you're
[4841.76 --> 4842.16]  interested in
[4842.16 --> 4842.58]  any of these,
[4842.64 --> 4843.02]  you can find
[4843.02 --> 4843.52]  links to them
[4843.52 --> 4843.94]  on our church
[4843.94 --> 4844.30]  website.
[4845.32 --> 4845.98]  The Catechism,
[4846.08 --> 4846.46]  the Heidelberg
[4846.46 --> 4846.94]  Catechism,
[4847.06 --> 4848.00]  describes this
[4848.00 --> 4849.96]  beautifully as
[4849.96 --> 4850.82]  it begins to
[4850.82 --> 4852.10]  discuss the
[4852.10 --> 4852.80]  Ten Commandments
[4852.80 --> 4853.22]  themselves.
[4853.38 --> 4853.78]  Question and
[4853.78 --> 4854.52]  answer 86
[4854.52 --> 4855.96]  asks, and I
[4855.96 --> 4856.54]  think we have,
[4857.66 --> 4858.52]  since we have
[4858.52 --> 4859.22]  been delivered
[4859.22 --> 4860.68]  from our misery
[4860.68 --> 4861.44]  by grace
[4861.44 --> 4862.34]  through Christ
[4862.34 --> 4863.30]  without any
[4863.30 --> 4864.16]  merits of our
[4864.16 --> 4865.30]  own, why then
[4865.30 --> 4866.30]  should we do
[4866.30 --> 4867.58]  good works?
[4867.68 --> 4868.18]  And this answer
[4868.18 --> 4868.70]  is beautiful,
[4868.70 --> 4871.12]  because Christ,
[4871.74 --> 4872.46]  having redeemed
[4872.46 --> 4873.20]  us by His
[4873.20 --> 4874.18]  blood, is also
[4874.18 --> 4875.68]  restoring us by
[4875.68 --> 4876.74]  His Spirit into
[4876.74 --> 4878.20]  His image, so
[4878.20 --> 4878.94]  that with our
[4878.94 --> 4880.18]  whole lives we
[4880.18 --> 4881.06]  may show that we
[4881.06 --> 4881.92]  are thankful to
[4881.92 --> 4882.62]  God for His
[4882.62 --> 4883.86]  benefits, so that
[4883.86 --> 4884.80]  He may be praised
[4884.80 --> 4885.86]  through us, so
[4885.86 --> 4886.52]  that we may be
[4886.52 --> 4887.40]  assured of our
[4887.40 --> 4888.10]  faith by its
[4888.10 --> 4889.20]  fruits, and so
[4889.20 --> 4890.14]  that by our
[4890.14 --> 4891.34]  godly living our
[4891.34 --> 4892.26]  neighbors may be
[4892.26 --> 4893.62]  won over to
[4893.62 --> 4893.98]  Christ.
[4893.98 --> 4894.02]  Christ.
[4895.24 --> 4896.18]  Why do we
[4896.18 --> 4897.04]  submit ourselves
[4897.04 --> 4898.36]  willingly to the
[4898.36 --> 4899.20]  Ten Commandments?
[4899.82 --> 4900.68]  Because we live
[4900.68 --> 4901.54]  lives of gratitude
[4901.54 --> 4902.46]  to God for what
[4902.46 --> 4903.44]  He has done in
[4903.44 --> 4904.62]  grace through Jesus
[4904.62 --> 4905.48]  Christ, and because
[4905.48 --> 4907.04]  by doing so, we
[4907.04 --> 4907.92]  reflect the very
[4907.92 --> 4909.20]  heart and nature
[4909.20 --> 4910.26]  of God, and we
[4910.26 --> 4911.48]  give Him praise for
[4911.48 --> 4912.52]  who He is, and
[4912.52 --> 4913.86]  because by doing so,
[4913.96 --> 4915.72]  we are assured of
[4915.72 --> 4916.64]  the hope that we
[4916.64 --> 4918.14]  have because of the
[4918.14 --> 4919.96]  fruits of our faith
[4919.96 --> 4921.40]  being borne out, and
[4921.40 --> 4922.86]  because in doing so,
[4922.86 --> 4924.76]  we might reveal God.
[4924.84 --> 4925.78]  We might be used of
[4925.78 --> 4927.02]  God to reveal Himself
[4927.02 --> 4929.30]  to our neighbors, and
[4929.30 --> 4930.08]  to win them over for
[4930.08 --> 4930.42]  Christ.
[4931.16 --> 4933.14]  And so, let me ask
[4933.14 --> 4935.58]  again, who is the
[4935.58 --> 4936.86]  law for?
[4938.36 --> 4939.12]  Let me put it this
[4939.12 --> 4939.62]  way, in a really
[4939.62 --> 4941.16]  practical way that
[4941.16 --> 4942.34]  will make sense of
[4942.34 --> 4943.50]  this, hopefully, for
[4943.50 --> 4943.94]  some of us.
[4945.20 --> 4946.28]  The first three
[4946.28 --> 4947.62]  commandments, as we
[4947.62 --> 4948.54]  read them, are about
[4948.54 --> 4949.50]  the being, and the
[4949.50 --> 4950.22]  name, and the
[4950.22 --> 4951.80]  perfection of God.
[4951.90 --> 4952.54]  They are about
[4952.54 --> 4954.12]  idolatry and
[4954.12 --> 4955.60]  abusing God's name
[4955.60 --> 4956.86]  because God's name,
[4957.00 --> 4958.06]  Yahweh, is a
[4958.06 --> 4959.44]  revelation of His
[4959.44 --> 4959.86]  being.
[4961.04 --> 4962.06]  And as Christians,
[4962.38 --> 4963.72]  right, we profess the
[4963.72 --> 4965.88]  absolute holiness of
[4965.88 --> 4966.26]  God.
[4966.66 --> 4969.52]  And so, how do you
[4969.52 --> 4971.56]  feel when others
[4971.56 --> 4972.66]  misuse the name of
[4972.66 --> 4972.96]  God?
[4974.22 --> 4975.54]  When others take the
[4975.54 --> 4976.32]  Lord's name in vain,
[4976.42 --> 4976.88]  is the old
[4976.88 --> 4977.36]  translation.
[4978.00 --> 4978.14]  Right?
[4978.18 --> 4979.26]  When someone cries
[4979.26 --> 4980.54]  out, oh my God, or
[4980.54 --> 4981.32]  just flippantly says,
[4981.32 --> 4984.48]  Jesus Christ, should
[4984.48 --> 4985.24]  you be offended by
[4985.24 --> 4985.54]  that?
[4987.10 --> 4988.28]  Should you correct
[4988.28 --> 4990.70]  non-believers, right,
[4990.74 --> 4991.32]  people who aren't
[4991.32 --> 4992.68]  Christian, because of
[4992.68 --> 4993.90]  your offense in that
[4993.90 --> 4994.18]  moment?
[4995.74 --> 4996.24]  And look, let me be
[4996.24 --> 4997.38]  clear, maybe you
[4997.38 --> 4999.58]  should be offended, but
[4999.58 --> 5001.60]  to be honest, you
[5001.60 --> 5002.72]  shouldn't be surprised.
[5004.38 --> 5004.78]  Right?
[5004.78 --> 5005.50]  Remember to whom
[5005.50 --> 5006.14]  these commands are
[5006.14 --> 5006.46]  given.
[5007.28 --> 5008.30]  They're given to the
[5008.30 --> 5010.16]  chosen people, people
[5010.16 --> 5011.24]  who have been reborn
[5011.24 --> 5012.34]  by the grace of God,
[5012.42 --> 5013.00]  people who have been
[5013.00 --> 5014.12]  called to a new
[5014.12 --> 5014.42]  life.
[5014.50 --> 5015.18]  And so, it shouldn't
[5015.18 --> 5016.26]  really surprise us,
[5016.28 --> 5017.24]  even if it does kind
[5017.24 --> 5018.48]  of offend us, that
[5018.48 --> 5019.12]  people who know
[5019.12 --> 5020.40]  nothing of God's new
[5020.40 --> 5021.48]  way of living don't
[5021.48 --> 5022.68]  live into that way of
[5022.68 --> 5022.94]  living.
[5024.64 --> 5026.78]  The Apostle Paul, he
[5026.78 --> 5028.86]  says, the law was
[5028.86 --> 5030.38]  given that trespass
[5030.38 --> 5031.36]  may increase.
[5032.74 --> 5033.14]  And so, whose
[5033.14 --> 5033.74]  trespass?
[5033.74 --> 5034.74]  Ours.
[5036.74 --> 5037.18]  Ours.
[5037.82 --> 5038.18]  Believers.
[5038.44 --> 5039.40]  Those who are saved
[5039.40 --> 5040.46]  by grace.
[5040.64 --> 5041.32]  And we know that this
[5041.32 --> 5042.08]  is true, because Paul
[5042.08 --> 5043.08]  adds in the next line,
[5043.44 --> 5044.74]  where sin increased,
[5045.00 --> 5046.82]  grace also increased.
[5046.90 --> 5047.54]  And so, let me ask you,
[5047.58 --> 5048.44]  who receives grace?
[5049.78 --> 5051.04]  The elect, the chosen.
[5051.68 --> 5051.80]  Right?
[5051.84 --> 5052.84]  Only the elect then
[5052.84 --> 5053.94]  increase their
[5053.94 --> 5054.58]  trespass.
[5054.86 --> 5055.62]  The law and its
[5055.62 --> 5057.32]  trespass is only truly
[5057.32 --> 5059.48]  possible for God's
[5059.48 --> 5060.20]  chosen.
[5060.20 --> 5062.20]  And so, by chiding
[5062.20 --> 5063.30]  or getting angry
[5063.30 --> 5064.92]  or correcting
[5064.92 --> 5065.94]  non-believing
[5065.94 --> 5067.14]  individuals who do
[5067.14 --> 5067.84]  something that they
[5067.84 --> 5068.76]  never understood to
[5068.76 --> 5071.20]  be wrong, are we
[5071.20 --> 5072.32]  not sending the
[5072.32 --> 5073.46]  wrong gospel
[5073.46 --> 5074.50]  message?
[5075.74 --> 5077.00]  Namely, that being
[5077.00 --> 5078.16]  right with God is
[5078.16 --> 5079.34]  primarily about how
[5079.34 --> 5080.94]  we behave and not
[5080.94 --> 5081.92]  primarily about what
[5081.92 --> 5082.94]  God has already done
[5082.94 --> 5083.48]  in Jesus.
[5084.54 --> 5084.60]  Right?
[5084.88 --> 5086.76]  Doing this implies
[5086.76 --> 5088.66]  that God demands a
[5088.66 --> 5089.62]  high moral standard
[5089.62 --> 5090.84]  apart from the work
[5090.84 --> 5092.16]  of Christ in order
[5092.16 --> 5093.36]  to merit the work
[5093.36 --> 5094.32]  of Christ.
[5095.18 --> 5096.20]  But that just isn't
[5096.20 --> 5096.72]  the gospel.
[5098.42 --> 5099.68]  I suggest to you
[5099.68 --> 5101.28]  that the proper way
[5101.28 --> 5102.24]  to understand the
[5102.24 --> 5102.94]  Ten Commandments,
[5103.00 --> 5103.62]  the proper way to
[5103.62 --> 5105.92]  understand what the
[5105.92 --> 5106.66]  Heidelberg Catechism
[5106.66 --> 5107.04]  and the Belgian
[5107.04 --> 5108.00]  Confession are saying
[5108.00 --> 5109.96]  is to see in relation
[5109.96 --> 5111.68]  to how believers,
[5112.40 --> 5113.68]  Christians, people who
[5113.68 --> 5114.66]  call themselves
[5114.66 --> 5115.76]  disciples of Jesus,
[5116.20 --> 5117.80]  use the name of God
[5117.80 --> 5118.76]  and how believers
[5118.76 --> 5120.02]  are supposed to hold
[5120.02 --> 5121.30]  each other accountable
[5121.30 --> 5122.56]  in its use.
[5123.84 --> 5125.02]  And so if you are a
[5125.02 --> 5125.82]  Christian here this
[5125.82 --> 5126.42]  morning and you
[5126.42 --> 5128.04]  flippantly misuse the
[5128.04 --> 5129.08]  name of God, then we
[5129.08 --> 5130.20]  have a conversation to
[5130.20 --> 5130.46]  have.
[5131.70 --> 5132.80]  But in your work a day
[5132.80 --> 5134.04]  week, if your
[5134.04 --> 5136.12]  colleagues do, that's a
[5136.12 --> 5138.28]  whole different reality.
[5139.96 --> 5141.20]  Expecting unbelievers to
[5141.20 --> 5142.40]  keep the law or even to
[5142.40 --> 5144.44]  respect it blurs that
[5144.44 --> 5146.14]  sharp divide between those
[5146.14 --> 5147.20]  who are God's people and
[5147.20 --> 5147.84]  those who aren't.
[5148.48 --> 5149.80]  The law as a way of
[5149.80 --> 5151.74]  gratitude is for those
[5151.74 --> 5152.20]  who are.
[5154.06 --> 5156.32]  Finally, I suggest to
[5156.32 --> 5158.28]  you that it is holding
[5158.28 --> 5160.82]  yourself to the high
[5160.82 --> 5162.34]  standard of gratitude
[5162.34 --> 5164.34]  that the law calls us is
[5164.34 --> 5166.34]  now how we avoid the
[5166.34 --> 5168.14]  so-called crisis of
[5168.14 --> 5169.66]  morality that has pushed
[5169.66 --> 5171.58]  so many people away from
[5171.58 --> 5173.02]  the church in the culture
[5173.02 --> 5174.56]  wars and in our modern
[5174.56 --> 5176.90]  world.
[5176.90 --> 5179.38]  The truth is keeping
[5179.38 --> 5180.96]  this rule of gratitude is
[5180.96 --> 5183.00]  only possible for those
[5183.00 --> 5184.46]  who have been filled with
[5184.46 --> 5185.18]  the Holy Spirit.
[5185.60 --> 5185.72]  Right?
[5185.76 --> 5186.66]  When you expect
[5186.66 --> 5188.54]  perfection from those who
[5188.54 --> 5189.66]  haven't been perfected by
[5189.66 --> 5191.16]  the blood of Jesus, all
[5191.16 --> 5192.08]  you do is push them
[5192.08 --> 5192.34]  away.
[5194.40 --> 5196.42]  And so precisely because
[5196.42 --> 5197.88]  you have been saved by
[5197.88 --> 5199.80]  grace through faith, you
[5199.80 --> 5201.78]  now can hold yourself to
[5201.78 --> 5203.60]  an impossibly high moral
[5203.60 --> 5204.98]  standard because it's
[5204.98 --> 5206.04]  still about grace.
[5206.98 --> 5207.18]  Right?
[5207.24 --> 5208.04]  You can't do it.
[5208.26 --> 5209.14]  You can't keep it.
[5209.34 --> 5210.66]  But thanks be to God, he
[5210.66 --> 5211.94]  gives you the Holy Spirit
[5211.94 --> 5213.60]  and he makes you able
[5213.60 --> 5214.90]  because nothing is
[5214.90 --> 5215.92]  impossible with God.
[5216.06 --> 5217.80]  And that includes your
[5217.80 --> 5219.32]  obedience to him.
[5220.32 --> 5222.24]  Your response to grace
[5222.24 --> 5223.58]  and gratitude looks
[5223.58 --> 5224.88]  impossible to the world
[5224.88 --> 5228.02]  around you because it is
[5228.02 --> 5228.78]  for them.
[5232.34 --> 5235.20]  But it's also incredibly
[5235.20 --> 5236.22]  compelling.
[5237.80 --> 5239.54]  In a world that will
[5239.54 --> 5242.66]  never understand, apart
[5242.66 --> 5244.54]  from their own experience
[5244.54 --> 5246.04]  of that grace, that
[5246.04 --> 5247.52]  gratitude lived in response
[5247.52 --> 5248.90]  to God's grace is how we
[5248.90 --> 5251.16]  now live to glory, for
[5251.16 --> 5252.78]  giving glory to God is a
[5252.78 --> 5254.12]  beautiful thing, but the
[5254.12 --> 5255.04]  world will never
[5255.04 --> 5255.70]  understand.
[5256.32 --> 5257.32]  It won't make sense.
[5258.18 --> 5258.28]  Right?
[5258.40 --> 5260.62]  How is it possible for a
[5260.62 --> 5261.96]  world to make sense of a
[5261.96 --> 5263.08]  group of people who hold
[5263.08 --> 5264.52]  themselves to an impossibly
[5264.52 --> 5266.26]  high standard of Sabbath,
[5266.80 --> 5269.24]  but a Sabbath that makes
[5269.24 --> 5270.58]  us take care of each
[5270.58 --> 5272.08]  other and makes sure that
[5272.08 --> 5272.94]  none of us have anything
[5272.94 --> 5273.30]  in need?
[5274.34 --> 5274.82]  Right?
[5274.86 --> 5276.28]  A Sabbath that rests in
[5276.28 --> 5278.26]  Jesus in spite of the
[5278.26 --> 5279.86]  storms that might be
[5279.86 --> 5280.96]  raging around us.
[5280.96 --> 5282.68]  Right?
[5282.72 --> 5283.92]  The world isn't going to
[5283.92 --> 5285.44]  understand a community
[5285.44 --> 5288.20]  that holds itself to such
[5288.20 --> 5290.86]  a high view of sex and
[5290.86 --> 5293.66]  sexuality as reserved for
[5293.66 --> 5294.56]  marriage between a husband
[5294.56 --> 5296.16]  and wife, and yet that
[5296.16 --> 5297.94]  same community is so
[5297.94 --> 5299.70]  permeated by grace that
[5299.70 --> 5301.30]  all, everyone feels
[5301.30 --> 5302.68]  welcomed and at home.
[5304.68 --> 5307.98]  You see, being a
[5307.98 --> 5309.44]  Christian isn't ultimately
[5309.44 --> 5310.82]  or even in the first
[5310.82 --> 5312.12]  place about living
[5312.12 --> 5313.44]  obediently to Jesus.
[5313.76 --> 5315.86]  It's about living because
[5315.86 --> 5317.58]  of Jesus.
[5319.34 --> 5320.88]  By grace through faith,
[5321.12 --> 5322.70]  finally, for the first
[5322.70 --> 5323.44]  time, compellingly,
[5324.34 --> 5326.50]  beautifully, you can have
[5326.50 --> 5327.52]  life.
[5329.04 --> 5330.52]  And life to the full.
[5331.56 --> 5333.52]  That life looks a certain
[5333.52 --> 5336.06]  way, and oh man, it is
[5336.06 --> 5337.06]  beautiful.
[5337.06 --> 5339.30]  It is mysterious,
[5340.20 --> 5345.14]  absolutely, but it is
[5345.14 --> 5346.66]  beautiful.
[5348.36 --> 5351.02]  And so, as we end this,
[5353.06 --> 5355.22]  don't sell yourself too
[5355.22 --> 5357.20]  short by limiting the
[5357.20 --> 5359.46]  power of God to enable
[5359.46 --> 5361.02]  you to be obedient to his
[5361.02 --> 5363.00]  high calling on your life in
[5363.00 --> 5364.80]  response to his gratitude, or
[5364.80 --> 5366.28]  in response to his grace as
[5366.28 --> 5367.04]  you live in gratitude.
[5368.60 --> 5371.82]  And second, don't push
[5371.82 --> 5373.84]  other people away from the
[5373.84 --> 5374.96]  grace of God that is on
[5374.96 --> 5377.18]  offer by demanding of them
[5377.18 --> 5378.54]  that they live as if they've
[5378.54 --> 5379.72]  already received the power of
[5379.72 --> 5381.76]  the Spirit, because they
[5381.76 --> 5382.86]  will miss it.
[5386.28 --> 5388.26]  And when we have the chance
[5388.26 --> 5391.14]  to know just how beautiful and
[5391.14 --> 5395.34]  mysterious that is, I for
[5395.34 --> 5397.88]  one don't want anyone to miss
[5397.88 --> 5398.14]  it.
[5398.78 --> 5399.02]  Amen?
[5400.06 --> 5400.98]  Let's pray together.
[5404.94 --> 5409.08]  Lord our God, transform us.
[5410.32 --> 5412.58]  Transform our hearts and lives.
[5413.14 --> 5415.30]  Transform our imaginations.
[5415.30 --> 5418.80]  Send us out now in the power of
[5418.80 --> 5420.28]  your Spirit that we might live
[5420.28 --> 5422.06]  lives of thanksgiving and
[5422.06 --> 5423.70]  gratitude to you, in obedience
[5423.70 --> 5425.32]  to you, because you, Lord God,
[5425.38 --> 5427.06]  have made us able.
[5428.28 --> 5430.42]  May we be so filled with the
[5430.42 --> 5432.62]  fruit of the Spirit that though
[5432.62 --> 5434.74]  it seems impossible to those who
[5434.74 --> 5436.22]  do not know, there is something
[5436.22 --> 5439.90]  amazingly compelling about our
[5439.90 --> 5440.20]  lives.
[5440.20 --> 5445.80]  May we, Lord God, be a people so
[5445.80 --> 5448.58]  committed to your design and
[5448.58 --> 5450.36]  intent for our life.
[5454.86 --> 5458.66]  And yet, may we be a people who
[5458.66 --> 5461.48]  know in the core of our being that
[5461.48 --> 5463.16]  it is only by grace that we have
[5463.16 --> 5465.82]  been saved through faith, that it
[5465.82 --> 5468.60]  is the gift of God so that no one
[5468.60 --> 5471.52]  can boast, so that no one can
[5471.52 --> 5476.68]  weaponize morality, so that no one
[5476.68 --> 5480.04]  would fall away because of what we
[5480.04 --> 5484.20]  have done or said or not done and
[5484.20 --> 5484.72]  not said.
[5486.30 --> 5490.40]  Use us to show the world yourself.
[5491.18 --> 5493.26]  In Jesus' name we pray.
[5493.26 --> 5494.70]  Amen.
[5495.64 --> 5496.34]  Amen.
[5498.60 --> 5508.86]  Please stand with us.
[5518.04 --> 5523.10]  Behold the wondrous mystery
[5523.10 --> 5527.68]  In the dawning of the King
[5527.68 --> 5532.94]  He the theme of heaven's praises
[5532.94 --> 5536.68]  Roamed in frail humanity
[5536.68 --> 5542.62]  In our longing, in our darkness
[5542.62 --> 5547.72]  Now the light of life has come
[5547.72 --> 5552.38]  Looked to Christ to condescended
[5552.38 --> 5557.64]  took on flesh to ransom us
[5557.64 --> 5569.56]  Come behold the wondrous mystery

[5579.38 --> 5584.64]  Never trace nor stain of sin
[5584.64 --> 5589.38]  See the true and better Adam
[5589.38 --> 5594.64]  Come to save the hell-bound man
[5594.64 --> 5599.64]  Christ the great and sure fulfillment
[5599.64 --> 5604.90]  Of the law in him we stand
[5604.90 --> 5615.90]  Come behold the wondrous mystery
[5615.90 --> 5620.90]  Christ the Lord upon the tree
[5620.90 --> 5626.16]  In the stead of ruined sinners
[5626.16 --> 5628.16]  In the stead of ruined sinners
[5628.16 --> 5630.16]  In the stead of ruined sinners
[5630.16 --> 5631.90]  Hangs the Lamb in victory
[5631.90 --> 5635.90]  See the price of our redemption
[5635.90 --> 5640.16]  See the Father's plan unfold
[5640.16 --> 5645.42]  Bringing many sons to glory
[5645.42 --> 5649.16]  Grace unmeasured

[5652.16 --> 5663.62]  Come behold the wondrous mystery
[5663.62 --> 5665.16]  Slain by death
[5665.80 --> 5668.16]  The God of life

[5671.60 --> 5673.16]  Ere restrain him
[5673.70 --> 5675.16]  Praise the Lord
[5675.78 --> 5678.50]  He is alive

[5691.36 --> 5691.92]  Christ in power
[5691.92 --> 5693.48]  Resurrected
[5693.48 --> 5698.38]  As we will be when he comes
[5698.38 --> 5703.50]  What a foretaste of deliverance
[5703.50 --> 5708.46]  How unwavering our hope
[5708.46 --> 5709.32]  Christ in power
[5709.32 --> 5711.16]  Christ in power
[5711.16 --> 5713.32]  Resurrected
[5713.92 --> 5719.60]  As we will be when he comes
[5719.60 --> 5737.62]  Go now this week with God
[5737.62 --> 5741.06]  Go now into Lent with God
[5741.06 --> 5744.78]  Who goes with you to enable you
[5744.78 --> 5749.26]  To live the life that you are called in him to live
[5749.26 --> 5752.10]  Receive his blessing
[5752.10 --> 5754.52]  May God go before you
[5754.52 --> 5755.78]  To lead you
[5755.78 --> 5757.86]  May God go behind you
[5757.86 --> 5758.84]  To guard you
[5758.84 --> 5761.02]  May God go beneath you
[5761.02 --> 5762.02]  To support you
[5762.02 --> 5764.08]  And may God go beside you
[5764.08 --> 5765.26]  To befriend you
[5765.26 --> 5767.58]  Do not be afraid
[5767.58 --> 5769.92]  Let the blessing of God come upon you today
[5769.92 --> 5771.60]  Do not be afraid
[5771.60 --> 5773.64]  But go in peace
[5773.64 --> 5776.78]  To love and serve the Lord
[5776.78 --> 5778.64]  Amen
[5778.64 --> 5804.22]  Amen
[5804.22 --> 5818.22]  Amen, Amen, Amen
[5818.22 --> 5829.14]  The Lord bless you and keep you

[5844.02 --> 5851.24]  And give you peace
[5851.24 --> 5861.92]  The Lord bless you and keep you
[5861.92 --> 5865.98]  Make his face shine upon you

[5898.04 --> 5913.10]  Amen, Amen, Amen
[5913.10 --> 5932.16]  May his favor be upon you
[5932.16 --> 5935.56]  And a thousand generations
[5935.56 --> 5937.62]  And your family
[5937.62 --> 5939.62]  And your children
[5939.62 --> 5941.62]  And their children
[5941.62 --> 5943.62]  And their children

[5984.74 --> 5985.74]  He is with you
[5985.74 --> 5986.74]  He is with you
[5986.74 --> 5988.74]  In the morning
[5988.74 --> 5989.74]  In the evening
[5989.74 --> 5991.74]  In your coming
[5991.74 --> 5993.74]  And your going
[5993.74 --> 5994.74]  In your weeping
[5994.74 --> 5996.74]  And rejoicing
[5996.74 --> 5997.80]  He is for you
[5997.80 --> 6010.80]  He is for you
[6010.80 --> 6018.80]  Amen

[6099.84 --> 6099.98]  Thank you.
[6099.98 --> 6129.96]  Thank you.
[6129.98 --> 6159.96]  Thank you.
[6159.98 --> 6189.96]  Thank you.
[6189.98 --> 6191.98]  Thank you.
