[0.00 → 6.70] I believe there's another miracle here in this room.
[7.58 → 10.94] This is the sound of dry bones rattling.
[13.76 → 17.86] This is the praise, make a dead man walk again.
[19.44 → 22.74] Open the grave, I'm coming out.
[22.96 → 25.62] I'm going to live, going to live again.
[25.62 → 29.86] This is the sound of dry bones rattling.
[44.86 → 55.18] Oh my God is able to save and deliver and heal and restore anything.
[55.62 → 57.74] That he wants to.
[58.84 → 65.62] And just as the metal was thrown on the bones of Elisha.
[65.96 → 70.44] If there's anything that he can do.
[71.48 → 74.62] And just as the stone there was rolled.
[74.86 → 79.74] That the tomb in the garden would happen.
[79.74 → 82.36] And God says to move.
[83.62 → 87.22] I feel him moving now.
[87.36 → 89.74] I feel him doing it now.
[89.74 → 92.74] I feel him doing it now.
[92.74 → 94.74] Doing it now.
[94.74 → 96.74] Doing it now.
[96.74 → 100.98] This is the sound of dry bones rattling.
[102.98 → 107.82] Yeah, this is the praise, make a dead man walk again.
[109.74 → 112.70] Open the grave, I'm calling out.
[112.96 → 115.44] I'm going to live, going to live again.
[116.08 → 119.02] Open the grave, I'm calling out.
[119.02 → 122.02] I'm going to live, going to live again.
[122.02 → 125.36] Open the grave, I'm calling out.
[125.36 → 128.74] I'm going to live, going to live again.
[129.32 → 132.58] This is the sound of dry bones rattling.
[132.58 → 147.04] So I prophesied as I was commanded.
[147.88 → 150.50] And as I was prophesying there was a noise.
[151.22 → 152.30] A rattling sound.
[153.26 → 154.84] And the bones came together.
[155.62 → 156.38] Bone to bone.
[156.38 → 160.64] I looked and tendons and flesh appeared on them.
[161.34 → 162.60] And skin covered them.
[163.08 → 164.42] But there was no breath in them.
[165.30 → 166.60] Then he said to me,
[167.30 → 168.62] Prophesy to the breath.
[169.60 → 170.94] Prophesy, son of man.
[171.28 → 172.24] And say to him,
[172.92 → 176.36] This is what the sovereign Lord says.
[177.28 → 180.12] Come, breath from the full winds.
[180.12 → 186.12] And breathe into these slaves that they may live.
[186.38 → 190.74] Live, live, drop on to the word of the Lord.
[190.74 → 197.26] Live, live, drop on to the word of the Lord.
[197.26 → 203.50] Live, live, drop on to the word of the Lord.
[203.56 → 209.30] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[209.78 → 213.16] This is the sound of dry bones rattling.
[213.16 → 217.66] Yeah, this is the praise
[217.66 → 220.08] Make a dead man walk again
[220.08 → 223.40] Hop in the crisis
[223.40 → 224.84] I'm calling out
[224.84 → 227.84] I'm going to live, going to live again
[227.84 → 229.82] Hop in the crisis
[229.82 → 231.18] I'm calling out
[231.18 → 234.10] I'm going to live, going to live again
[234.10 → 236.10] Hop in the crisis
[236.10 → 237.50] I'm calling out
[237.50 → 241.06] I'm going to live, going to live again
[241.06 → 244.66] This is the sound of drum bombs rattling
[271.06 → 297.38] There's no shadow you won't light up
[297.38 → 299.86] Mountain you won't climb up
[299.86 → 304.74] Coming after me
[304.74 → 307.70] No wall you won't kick down
[307.70 → 310.10] Lie you won't tear down
[310.10 → 314.34] Coming after me
[314.34 → 317.46] There's no shadow you won't light up
[317.46 → 320.02] Mountain you won't climb up
[320.02 → 324.42] Coming after me
[324.42 → 327.38] No wall you won't kick down
[327.38 → 329.78] Lie you won't tear down
[329.78 → 331.78] Coming after me
[331.78 → 335.62] Oh the overwhelming
[335.62 → 337.62] Never ending
[337.62 → 341.62] Reckless love of God
[341.62 → 345.86] Oh it chases me down
[345.86 → 347.86] Fights till I'm found
[347.86 → 351.70] Leaves the 99
[351.70 → 353.70] And I couldn't earn it
[353.70 → 355.70] And I couldn't earn it
[355.70 → 356.58] I don't deserve it
[356.58 → 361.54] Still you give yourself away
[361.54 → 365.54] Oh the overwhelming
[365.54 → 367.54] Never ending
[367.54 → 369.54] Never ending

[2222.42 → 2225.86] To the Father are restored
[2225.86 → 2229.36] And the church of Christ was born

[2296.82 → 2311.68] You know what?
[2311.70 → 2314.96] We're going to sit over here today because I just think that's a little squishy over there.
[2320.28 → 2321.00] All right.
[2326.82 → 2331.58] It's Easter today.
[2332.24 → 2334.70] I don't know the Easter eggs in South.
[2335.64 → 2337.20] I'm not with Easter today.
[2337.26 → 2338.56] You knew what Easter was today.
[2338.60 → 2339.10] Well, that's good.
[2339.48 → 2340.68] You all knew that already.
[2340.68 → 2341.12] I'm not with Easter.
[2341.12 → 2342.56] I'm not with Easter today.
[2343.78 → 2344.66] I'm not with Easter today.
[2345.12 → 2347.18] I'm not with Easter today.
[2347.32 → 2348.26] Very exciting.
[2348.44 → 2355.16] So I want you guys to take a quick look over at all the flowers that you guys helped to contribute.
[2355.16 → 2364.32] So what I really like about the flower offering is it reminds me first about something really beautiful that God did for us.
[2365.32 → 2367.30] What do you think it is, Zoe?
[2370.02 → 2372.90] Yeah, that Jesus died for our sins and that he rose again.
[2373.34 → 2377.54] And it also reminds me that there is something beautiful that we can do for God.
[2377.54 → 2379.70] And that looks really beautiful.
[2379.90 → 2384.28] And we can say thank you to God for the beautiful thing that he has done.
[2384.34 → 2388.90] And that kind of reminds me of how we can respond to that gift God has given us.
[2389.96 → 2391.44] So I have a bag here.
[2392.38 → 2394.00] It's a bag of secret stuff.
[2394.14 → 2395.28] That's pretty accurate.
[2395.40 → 2396.20] So I have this bag.
[2397.44 → 2398.90] I do like secret stuff.
[2398.90 → 2402.58] Who knows what a surprise is?
[2402.64 → 2404.48] Put your hand up if you know what a surprise is.
[2405.14 → 2406.32] Who likes surprises?
[2406.72 → 2407.48] Keep your hand up.
[2407.54 → 2409.46] Yeah, you like it when someone surprises you?
[2409.74 → 2413.38] Or would you, who would rather know about something and not be surprised?
[2413.80 → 2413.98] Yeah.
[2414.34 → 2414.86] Some of you.
[2416.38 → 2418.50] I would rather usually know too.
[2418.68 → 2420.42] I don't really like surprises that much.
[2420.84 → 2421.76] You know what it is.
[2421.86 → 2423.44] Well, Easter eggs.
[2423.54 → 2424.26] Not Easter eggs.
[2424.26 → 2428.30] So in here I have a bag of a surprise.
[2428.76 → 2430.80] And we're going to open it when we get to the big room.
[2431.22 → 2432.86] Because I'm going to make you wait a little bit longer.
[2433.18 → 2436.70] Because today we are going to be talking about God's wonderful surprise.
[2437.02 → 2439.92] That's the name of our story from the Jesus Storybook Bible.
[2440.80 → 2445.32] And for the disciples and for all the people, the wonderful surprise was what?
[2445.40 → 2449.16] That Jesus had risen from the tomb and that it was empty.
[2449.66 → 2453.42] So let's pray together, and then we're going to go right away to children's worship time.
[2454.74 → 2459.04] Lord Jesus, thank you for this day when we can celebrate that you rose from the dead.
[2459.44 → 2463.48] Thank you for that amazing and beautiful gift that you gave for each one of us here.
[2464.32 → 2468.78] Please help us to open our hearts to what you have to teach us today
[2468.78 → 2471.68] as we learn more through church and children's worship time.
[2472.02 → 2472.24] Amen.

[2529.46 → 2537.62] Good morning.
[2537.72 → 2538.56] My name is Glenn Not.
[2538.56 → 2543.16] I'm one of the elders here at Emanuel Church, and it's my privilege this morning to lead
[2543.16 → 2545.04] you in our church family prayer.
[2545.04 → 2549.04] Before we go to prayer, we have one announcement.
[2549.04 → 2554.96] We are still looking for nominations for the Office of Elder and Deacon for this church.
[2554.96 → 2558.52] So that process is open until April 26th.
[2558.52 → 2562.98] So if there is somebody that you would like to nominate, please be sure to do that this
[2562.98 → 2563.98] week.
[2563.98 → 2567.80] And your nominations can be submitted to your district elder or to the church office.
[2567.80 → 2572.40] So let's go to God in prayer.
[2572.40 → 2573.40] Amen.
[2573.40 → 2574.40] Amen.
[2574.40 → 2575.40] Amen.

[2576.40 → 2577.40] Amen.
[2577.40 → 2578.40] Amen.
[2578.40 → 2582.56] We come to you this Easter Sunday with joy in our hearts as we gather to worship and
[2582.56 → 2586.64] we celebrate our risen Saviour, Christ Jesus.
[2586.64 → 2591.64] We thank you that he willingly bore our sin and iniquity upon himself, in obedience to your
[2591.64 → 2598.46] command, and took our sin and iniquity to the cross, which we deserve.
[2598.46 → 2605.18] We pray that you grant us the power to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the
[2605.18 → 2611.38] love of Christ and to know this love that surpasses knowledge.
[2611.38 → 2616.40] Lord Jesus we celebrate your resurrection on this Easter Sunday and acknowledge your
[2616.40 → 2620.48] victory over sin and death.
[2620.48 → 2625.68] We acknowledge that all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to you and we
[2625.68 → 2632.44] take comfort knowing that you have promised to be with us to the very end of the age.
[2632.44 → 2637.92] Lord Jesus help us as your church through the power of the Holy Spirit to live in obedience
[2637.92 → 2644.02] to your command to make disciples of all nations.
[2644.02 → 2648.44] Bless the leadership of our local church with wisdom as it seeks to discern your will for
[2648.44 → 2652.64] this church on an ongoing basis.
[2652.64 → 2657.24] As the terms of some of our elders and deacons will end soon, we ask that you provide people
[2657.24 → 2662.08] who are willing to fill these roles with service.
[2662.08 → 2668.32] This morning we ask that you comfort Robin Baumann who recently lost her father due to illness.
[2668.32 → 2675.90] Grant Robin and her family your peace and your presence as they grieve.
[2675.90 → 2680.50] We thank you that Harry Fritz could return home after spending some time in the hospital
[2680.50 → 2682.66] with pneumonia.
[2682.66 → 2687.46] Grant him a full and quick recovery.
[2687.46 → 2693.28] Bless all those who deal with illness, whether physical illness, mental illness.
[2693.28 → 2699.72] Lord we pray that they experience your comforting presence as they cope with their illness.
[2699.72 → 2707.88] We thank you for all who provide care, whether they be family members or healthcare professionals.
[2707.88 → 2714.94] We ask that you strengthen and encourage them as they care for their loved ones or patients.
[2714.94 → 2722.12] We thank you that Sebastian, Sandy and their children are eligible now to apply for refugee status.
[2722.12 → 2728.98] Bless this process and bless the refugee sponsorship committee and other groups within our church
[2728.98 → 2733.28] denomination as they work through this process.
[2733.28 → 2739.54] We pray that you relieve any stress that Sebastian and Sandy may have as they wait for things to
[2739.54 → 2741.38] unfold.
[2741.38 → 2745.60] Grant them your peace.
[2745.60 → 2749.38] We continue to lift the people of Ukraine to you.
[2749.38 → 2753.34] Comfort those who mourn the loss of loved ones.
[2753.34 → 2757.86] Watch over the millions of people who have been displaced.
[2757.86 → 2764.14] Bless all who are involved in providing food and shelter to those who are displaced.
[2764.14 → 2770.38] Where refugee sponsorship is an option for displaced people, we pray that governments around the
[2770.38 → 2777.12] world may move quickly to process new immigrants.
[2777.12 → 2784.26] Strengthen and encourage the Ukrainians who stayed behind to fight against the invading army.
[2784.26 → 2789.32] Give them courage that they need to resist this invasion.
[2789.32 → 2795.92] And ultimately Lord, we ask that the Russian leaders will have a change of heart and exit
[2795.92 → 2798.16] Ukraine.
[2798.16 → 2804.90] We pray for an end to the bloodshed and the destruction and ask for lasting peace in this
[2804.90 → 2806.90] region.
[2806.90 → 2811.14] Father, we thank you for your word.
[2811.14 → 2815.94] And as we read it and study it this morning, we ask that you bless Pastor Chris with insight
[2815.94 → 2818.02] and wisdom.
[2818.02 → 2823.68] Our prayer is that all who worship here today will meet Jesus through the power of the Holy
[2823.68 → 2824.68] Spirit.
[2824.68 → 2825.68] Amen.
[2828.16 → 2845.72] Have a Bible handy.
[2845.72 → 2851.32] I'm going to invite you to open it up to Mark 16.

[2859.92 → 2860.92] Amen.

[2905.40 → 2907.48] Amen.
[2907.48 → 2909.40] Amen.
[2909.40 → 2910.36] Amen.
[2910.36 → 2917.74] large had been rolled away. As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white
[2917.74 → 2925.98] robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed. Don't be alarmed, he said. You are looking
[2925.98 → 2936.02] for Jesus, the Nazarene, who was crucified. He is risen. He is not here. See the place where they lay
[2936.02 → 2944.08] him. But go, tell his disciples and Peter, he is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see
[2944.08 → 2954.60] him just as he told you. Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled the tomb. They said
[2954.60 → 2960.08] nothing to anyone because they were afraid. This is the word of the Lord.
[2966.02 → 2976.04] Now, I don't know how much you may have experienced this or how well you've been able to put your finger
[2976.04 → 2987.32] on it, but something has changed. Something is different. Now, before you jump to conclusions
[2987.32 → 2991.98] and assume that you know what I'm talking about here, right, I'm not just talking about the tomb of
[2991.98 → 2999.92] Jesus being empty, right, as if we can really just talk about the empty tomb, right? There's really no
[2999.92 → 3004.50] way to overstate the impact and the meaning of the resurrection, and we'll come back to that.
[3005.18 → 3015.72] But right now, I am talking about something else. Something in the air. Something has changed,
[3015.72 → 3021.30] and I bet for most of us, we can feel it more than we can describe it.
[3024.04 → 3031.40] We live in the change. We live this change more than we can define it.
[3033.08 → 3037.84] But if you are a Christian, and you're here with us this morning, in person or online,
[3038.28 → 3045.58] maybe you feel it just a little bit heavier in moments like this, right? As the gather for Easter
[3045.58 → 3051.88] worship and the weight of glory settles just a little bit heavier on our shoulders and in our
[3051.88 → 3058.88] hearts. But, and here's what we're beginning to see, right, that as the same time as our hearts and
[3058.88 → 3067.04] minds are being pulled up in worship, it seems that our feet are being pulled under the sinking sand of
[3067.04 → 3074.18] the ground, right? Our imaginations are being stretched out towards the transcendent, even as the frame below
[3074.18 → 3084.36] holds us back. Because you see, it used to be easier, or at least it used to be more clear,
[3085.56 → 3091.44] right? It used to be simpler. As a world, as a culture, we used to know what was up and what was
[3091.44 → 3097.28] down, right? The lines used to be drawn more clearly. We knew what was sacred, and we knew what was
[3097.28 → 3103.94] secular, right? It used to be that we had a religious sphere and a public sphere, even if there
[3103.94 → 3109.46] was a few outliers and some crossover. The basic definitions that function in our world together
[3109.46 → 3115.14] were clear. You had faith and you had fact, right? And whether you saw them in agreement or in a
[3115.14 → 3122.40] juxtaposition, the categories held fast. Now, maybe some of you still see the world like that,
[3122.40 → 3128.94] right? It's a sort of binary. It's either or. Furthermore, it's one or the other. But for most of us living today in
[3128.94 → 3139.14] the 21st century western world, something has changed. Now, if you're under 40, you have a sense
[3139.14 → 3147.08] of what I'm talking about, and maybe you can remember the loss. If you're under 30, you only know that sense
[3147.08 → 3153.56] as somebody else's history. And if you're under 20, you can't imagine the world any different
[3153.56 → 3160.60] because this is all you know, right? The once neat categories of faith and fact have blurred and have
[3160.60 → 3168.44] blended what was once either or exists now in the struggle of both and, of yes and everything and no
[3168.44 → 3177.72] and nothing all at the same time. And maybe that's the best way to describe the change, right? At the exact
[3177.72 → 3187.50] time that I know this or that thing to be true, right then I know it to be impossible, right? My heart
[3187.50 → 3194.64] longs for something more. It longs for eternity, for transcendence, for something bigger and beyond me. And yet,
[3194.64 → 3199.96] at exactly the same time that that longing exists in me, the world feels closed.
[3202.62 → 3210.60] In the day-to-day of life and faith, the system is small. It's too small, really. Everything I could
[3210.60 → 3217.20] ever need is a DM or a text or a tweet away, right? I can skip the dishes, I can get Uber Eats, I can
[3217.20 → 3221.32] Google or Amazon it, and it can be at my door within 12 hours if I have a Prime account.
[3221.32 → 3227.30] But somehow, my heart knows that that's not enough.
[3229.30 → 3239.30] And yet, even as I feel the haunting, right? This haunting for more, like a spectral affection just
[3239.30 → 3245.38] beyond my reach, slipping palpably through my fingers. Even as I feel that, my skepticism
[3245.38 → 3253.96] wells up, and it pulls me firmly back to the ground. In my head, I want what philosophers used to call
[3253.96 → 3264.00] foundational certitude, but my heart refuses to land. And it's into this sort of ephemeral
[3264.00 → 3271.96] unknowing, but wanting to be known, that I love the way the Gospel of Mark ends.
[3271.96 → 3278.88] The resurrection story speaks into this precise cultural moment.
[3278.88 → 3287.26] So the women head to the tomb, and they do so in order to anoint Jesus' body, because he died just
[3287.26 → 3293.72] before the Sabbath was to start. The Sabbath, in Jewish culture, remember that the day begins on
[3293.72 → 3301.30] the evening before. And so they couldn't do ordinary labours on the Sabbath, and so his body was placed in
[3301.30 → 3308.14] the tomb without ceremony or without funeral preparations. And so the women head to the tomb,
[3308.54 → 3318.62] and they wonder who will move this stone? Now, it was common for tombs to be cut into hillsides,
[3318.98 → 3325.84] and to have a round stone, to have stonework on the face, and to have an entrance cut, and then a round
[3325.84 → 3330.38] stone that would roll in front of it. I have a picture, actually, that we can put up on the screen.
[3332.04 → 3339.48] This is a picture that I took. Do we have the picture? There it is. This is a picture that is
[3339.48 → 3345.96] from a trip that I took to Israel, and this is a hill country just outside of Jerusalem. This is
[3345.96 → 3353.80] probably very similar to what these women would have gone to find. And because the tombs were usually
[3353.80 → 3360.48] for families, they could be opened and then sealed after each burial need. And if you look at the
[3360.48 → 3366.10] picture there, you can see that there's a bit of an outer room to it, where they would prepare the body
[3366.10 → 3372.78] and where it lays for the first few days after death. And eventually, the body gets moved into, deeper
[3372.78 → 3381.18] into the tomb, into the place there, and there would be other sort of rooms off to the side, or chambers,
[3381.18 → 3386.08] or boxes where bodies would move, so that when the next person from the family died, they would be
[3386.08 → 3390.24] able to come and use that front room, and then move to the back, and the like. And so when we read,
[3390.56 → 3394.76] they went into the room, and they looked to the right, even this picture here, exactly, there's a
[3394.76 → 3400.60] funeral bench to the right, as you walk in the first door, where the body would have laid. And then
[3400.60 → 3406.80] there's a second door beyond, where eventually it would have been moved. So it's into this first chamber
[3406.80 → 3412.98] that they go, and they see a young man or an angel dressed in white. And he says to them,
[3413.38 → 3419.18] right, he sees their alarm, of course, they see this white person sitting there, and the stone having
[3419.18 → 3425.64] been rolled away, and Jesus' body not there, and he says, don't be alarmed. You are looking for Jesus.
[3425.64 → 3432.52] He is not here, he has risen. Go, tell the disciples, go to Galilee, and you will see him there.
[3432.52 → 3440.00] And then, and this is why I love this story, and the way that Mark tells it here, for our modern
[3440.00 → 3446.96] context, right, for the sort of spiritual frame that we find ourselves in now, what does Mark say?
[3448.88 → 3457.56] Trembling and bewildered, the woman went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone
[3457.56 → 3466.40] because they were afraid. And then Mark just ends the story. Now, I know that if you're looking at it
[3466.40 → 3471.22] in your own Bible, some of you will see more text later on, some of you will see that blocked out,
[3471.26 → 3476.66] or with a little note there. I don't want to get into the whole weeds of textual criticism and the
[3476.66 → 3482.04] like, but suffice it to say that that longer ending probably isn't part of Mark's original.
[3482.04 → 3489.10] He wanted to end it abruptly. He wanted to leave us in that place of trembling and bewildered and
[3489.10 → 3499.28] fleeing for fear. And I think that that's exactly what Easter Sunday is like for most of us today,
[3499.50 → 3508.18] right? We want to believe, but it seems impossible, right? We want certitude, but we're bewildered.
[3508.18 → 3517.28] We want conviction and a boldness that comes from that, but we're still afraid, right? The challenge
[3517.28 → 3525.44] of belief in an increasingly post-Christian 21st century world is just this, the constant pulling
[3525.44 → 3533.60] down of pressure and doubt, knowing that you should, but feeling like you can't, feeling like you do,
[3533.60 → 3541.16] but knowing it's impossible, right? The experience of Mary and Mary and Salome define our experience of
[3541.16 → 3549.62] faith and resurrection. This is where we live now. And here's the thing, because it's not just Christians,
[3550.62 → 3558.14] right? It's all of us. The human condition is to love, the human nature, right? Anthropologically,
[3558.14 → 3565.82] we are wired to love and to desire and to believe. Now, we might use different words for that, right? But there is a
[3565.82 → 3574.14] pull of eternity on your heart that unsettles, that's a restless wandering, that's not completely satisfied
[3574.14 → 3582.62] in a longing for an experience of beauty, and yet distinctly bound to the ground, looking to what is
[3582.62 → 3593.70] and knowing what's not. One philosopher writes, he says, even as faith endures in our secular age,
[3593.84 → 3600.26] believing does not come easy. Faith is fraught, confession is haunted by an inescapable sense of
[3600.26 → 3607.12] its contestability. We don't believe instead of doubting, we believe while doubting.
[3607.12 → 3619.62] This is the life of faith that I know, that I bet most of you are familiar with. The same philosopher
[3619.62 → 3628.20] will go on, he says, the doubter's doubt is faith, right? His temptation is belief, and it is a temptation
[3628.20 → 3636.54] that has not been entirely quelled, even in our secular age, right? We oscillate between faith and doubt,
[3636.54 → 3643.16] assurance and skepticism, conviction and complacency. In fact, right, we don't even oscillate back and
[3643.16 → 3649.82] forth. All of those feels exist at the same time in us, right? We are pulled up and pushed down at the
[3649.82 → 3655.62] same time. Transcendence comes crashing through the neat, organized, bordered, bound picture of reality
[3655.62 → 3664.18] only to mess up what we have so carefully crafted all again. And that's just it.
[3666.54 → 3676.74] The mystery is messy, and faith won't be confined to our propositional boxes, just like Jesus won't be bound
[3676.74 → 3687.34] to a grave. You see, I think, and I know that I am guilty of this, I think we make a mistake when we think of
[3687.34 → 3697.42] Easter as being about proving that God has power over sin and death. Now, before you call the heresy police on me,
[3697.86 → 3703.78] don't hear what I'm not saying, right? Because the empty tomb does that, right? That is God's proof of power.
[3704.08 → 3708.72] I really like the way that Tom Wright puts it so forcefully. He says,
[3708.72 → 3714.68] the only possible reason why early Christianity began and took the shape it did is that the tomb
[3714.68 → 3719.54] really was empty and that people really did meet Jesus alive again.
[3722.02 → 3730.06] There's a story told about a young Robert Louis Stevenson. You may not know who that is. He
[3730.06 → 3734.04] was born in 1850. He lived in Scotland. Furthermore, he was a novelist,
[3734.04 → 3741.18] and he became famous for his writing. But when he was a child in Scotland, now in those days,
[3741.64 → 3748.86] street lights didn't just come on when a photo cell on the top sensed too little light from the sun,
[3749.48 → 3755.68] right? People were hired to walk around with a candle and a jar of oil, and they would go from
[3755.68 → 3760.88] light post to light post with a ladder slung over their shoulder, lean the ladder up against the light
[3760.88 → 3766.72] post, climb up the ladder, open the little jar, top off the oil, light it, close the lid, climb back
[3766.72 → 3772.16] down the ladder, and then move 20 feet to the next one and do it all over again, right? Back and forth.
[3772.28 → 3778.66] And Robert Louis Stevenson remembers watching this happen from his window, watching the man who was
[3778.66 → 3783.86] going from light post to light post to light post in the dark, lighting these lights. He turned to his
[3783.86 → 3793.46] parents, and he said, look, they're punching holes in the darkness. That's what Easter does, right? Jesus
[3793.46 → 3800.30] really did live the life of perfect righteousness. He really did die on Good Friday for the sins of all,
[3800.48 → 3807.90] and the tomb in which his body is really laid is really empty. By his resurrection, Jesus is punching
[3807.90 → 3815.88] holes in the darkness of sin and death and Satan. And so if today you are facing sin or death or Satan,
[3816.00 → 3821.28] if you are feeling overwhelmed and overdressed, if you are feeling brokenhearted or just broken,
[3821.58 → 3830.68] the resurrection is Jesus coming into this world and saying, not forever, not for always, maybe for
[3830.68 → 3837.80] right now. But the end of the story is the empty tomb. The end of the story is our resurrection just
[3837.80 → 3849.26] as Jesus was resurrected. So I believe all that. But this story, this true story isn't first about
[3849.26 → 3857.48] proving, right? If this was first about proving it to be true, we would probably see Jesus in the story.
[3857.48 → 3866.60] But we don't. Instead, I suggest to you that this story isn't about proving, it's about stirring,
[3867.22 → 3874.02] right? It isn't about the effect, though that is huge and world-changing. This is about the affect,
[3874.38 → 3880.32] right? And the effect is effective to punch holes in the darkness, not just 2,000 years ago, but today,
[3880.32 → 3889.50] now, in your life. Hearts of stone become hearts of flesh, dead come alive, light shines in the
[3889.50 → 3894.88] darkness, imaginations becoming alive for the impossible and the impossible becoming possible.
[3895.62 → 3903.68] This is about being bewildered and yet still believing. This is about trembling and being transformed.
[3903.68 → 3919.76] Amid your doubts, Jesus says, come, come to me. In your assurances, Jesus says, go, go to all the world.
[3920.90 → 3930.16] And to your questions, he says, yes. In your wandering, he calls forth wonder.
[3930.16 → 3938.26] Jesus said to Thomas and the other disciples at the end of the Gospel of John, a different account of this,
[3938.34 → 3948.72] he said, blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed. In those words, Jesus is talking to us.
[3949.64 → 3959.42] He's talking to you. Believe and you are blessed. Believe even with doubt and he is with you.
[3959.42 → 3965.54] Believe even as you doubt, and you are given something more than your heart can imagine,
[3965.92 → 3969.12] but exactly what you were created for.
[3970.52 → 3972.68] Even as we feel
[3972.68 → 3975.36] rootless and unsure,
[3975.98 → 3979.42] his resurrection brings to us a rootedness.
[3979.42 → 3993.42] Even as we experience the chaos of culture, his resurrection brings a firm truth and foundation.
[3994.52 → 4002.68] And the rootedness that he brings is a rootedness of liturgy and word and in just a moment, here, sacrament.
[4002.68 → 4010.22] In a moment, we will come to this table, and we will take in Jesus through the bread and through the wine.
[4010.84 → 4013.50] In a moment, we will touch, taste and see.
[4013.90 → 4021.88] In a moment, transcendence will once again come crashing down through to you and to me as we come to the table.
[4021.88 → 4028.58] The table is set because the tomb is empty.
[4029.80 → 4033.54] The tomb is empty and so our hearts are full.
[4034.28 → 4038.50] The tomb is empty and so come to the table.
[4039.88 → 4042.68] This table is for those who are trembling.
[4042.68 → 4046.50] The bread is for those who are bewildered.
[4047.14 → 4050.32] The juice is for those who come in joy.
[4051.40 → 4057.68] He is risen and he is here.
[4059.12 → 4064.28] Come and see your king at the table.
[4066.44 → 4069.50] Lift your hearts to the Lord.
[4069.50 → 4079.46] We lift them up to the Lord.
[4082.14 → 4084.54] Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
[4085.38 → 4088.14] For it is right for us to give thanks.
[4088.82 → 4089.30] Let's pray.
[4092.88 → 4096.10] With joy, we praise you, gracious God.
[4096.82 → 4098.86] For you have created heaven and earth.
[4098.86 → 4104.96] You have made us in your image and kept covenant with us even when we fell into sin.
[4106.14 → 4115.60] We give you thanks for Jesus Christ who by his life, death and resurrection opened to us the way of everlasting life.
[4115.60 → 4118.68] And so we come to the table.
[4119.56 → 4120.16] Amen.
[4120.16 → 4131.32] Before he suffered, Jesus gave us this memorial of his sacrifice until he comes again.
[4132.50 → 4135.98] The Lord Jesus, on the night that he was betrayed, he took bread.
[4136.98 → 4140.00] And when he had given thanks, he broke it, and he said,
[4140.00 → 4143.30] This is my body, which is for you.
[4144.20 → 4146.60] Do this in remembrance of me.
[4148.28 → 4152.76] And in the same way, he took the cup after supper and said,
[4153.14 → 4156.34] This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[4157.16 → 4160.00] Do this in remembrance of me.
[4160.00 → 4169.36] For whenever we eat this bread and drink this cup, we proclaim the Lord's death and his resurrection until he comes again.
[4170.10 → 4175.00] This is the mystery of our faith.
[4175.00 → 4183.78] Your death, O Christ, we proclaim.
[4184.56 → 4186.98] Your resurrection, we affirm with joy.
[4187.12 → 4189.84] You're coming, we wait with hope.
[4190.46 → 4193.46] Glory be to you, Lord Jesus.
[4193.46 → 4199.46] Church family, the Lord has prepared his table for all who love him.
[4199.86 → 4202.46] For all who trust in him alone for their salvation.
[4203.02 → 4209.18] And so come to this table now, you who have much faith and you who would like to have more.
[4210.06 → 4216.16] Come to this table, you who have been here often and you who have not been for a long time.
[4216.16 → 4219.40] You who have tried to follow Jesus and you who have failed.
[4219.40 → 4224.70] Come to this table because Jesus Christ is raised.
[4225.38 → 4229.60] Come if you are here or if you are at home and online.
[4229.82 → 4233.78] It is Christ who invites us to meet him here.
[4234.74 → 4239.16] These are the gifts of God for the people of God.
[4241.00 → 4248.20] Just a moment, we are going to have elders invite you to come in groups to the front to participate
[4248.20 → 4250.70] in the table together.
[4251.50 → 4252.84] It's a tight fit up here.
[4253.66 → 4256.96] So take the space that you need, spread out.
[4257.04 → 4260.42] It won't be a perfect circle or an oval, but we'll make it work.
[4261.08 → 4265.20] If you are unable to come to the front as an elder comes to your row,
[4265.32 → 4269.26] please just indicate to them, and they will serve you in your seats.
[4270.70 → 4275.38] Additionally, when you come up to the front on the trays of bread,
[4275.50 → 4277.98] there's a little bowl in the centre that has gluten-free.
[4278.20 → 4280.50] Bread for those of you who need it.
[4282.84 → 4287.68] Finally, if you are coming up, we invite you to come up with your entire family.
[4288.10 → 4292.42] And so even if your whole family is not going to participate in the supper together,
[4293.12 → 4299.30] come on up with them that they might stand with you to participate in the table in that way.
[4299.98 → 4304.10] I'd like to invite the serving elders and the worship team up here first
[4304.10 → 4308.10] so that we can serve them, and then they will lead us through.
[4308.10 → 4323.04] Body of Christ.
[4327.56 → 4328.46] Body of Christ.
[4328.46 → 4329.78] Body of Christ.

[4413.02 → 4443.00] The blood of Christ shed for you.
[4443.02 → 4473.00] The blood of Christ shed for you.

[4512.00 → 4525.00] The blood of Christ shed for you.
[4525.00 → 4533.00] How deep the Father's love for us.
[4534.00 → 4539.00] How vast beyond all measure.
[4539.00 → 4546.00] That he should give his only Son.
[4546.00 → 4553.00] To make a wretch his treasure.
[4553.00 → 4560.00] How great the pain of searing loss.
[4560.00 → 4561.00] The blood of Christ shed for you.
[4561.00 → 4562.00] The blood of Christ shed for you.

[4572.00 → 4579.52] I bring many signs to glory.
[4583.54 → 4595.82] Behold the man upon a cross, my sin upon his shoulders.
[4595.82 → 4609.60] Ashamed I hear my mocking voice call out along the scum of earth.
[4610.54 → 4622.90] It was my sin that dealt in there, until it was a calm there.
[4622.90 → 4629.58] His dying breath has brought me life.
[4630.58 → 4634.90] I know that it is me.
[4638.90 → 4644.90] I will not boast in anything.
[4644.90 → 4651.40] No gifts, no power, no wisdom.
[4653.18 → 4659.24] But I will boast in Jesus Christ.
[4659.92 → 4664.58] His death and resurrection.
[4664.58 → 4694.58] 
[4694.58 → 4698.58] What I gained from his reward.
[4699.72 → 4705.16] I cannot give an answer.
[4706.90 → 4713.34] But this I know with all my heart.
[4713.34 → 4719.62] His wounds have paid my ransom.
[4719.62 → 4722.62] I cannot give an answer.
[4722.62 → 4726.62] I cannot give an answer.
[4726.62 → 4729.04] I cannot give an answer.
[4729.04 → 4757.28] My Lord, My love is and your,
[4757.28 → 4769.84] That is so dearly that I, the guilty one,
[4769.84 → 4775.94] ready for me.
[4776.00 → 4783.12] Oh, raising love for what sacrifice was,
[4783.12 → 4788.96] the son of God given for me.
[4788.96 → 4795.36] My debt he pays and my debt he dies,
[4795.36 → 4807.36] that I, I did, that I, I did.
[4807.36 → 4817.18] And so he watched and died,
[4817.18 → 4822.10] and his son rejected,
[4824.02 → 4829.98] but all the money shed,
[4829.98 → 4835.80] and all the money shed.
[4835.80 → 4842.80] Oh, raising love for what sacrifice was,
[4842.80 → 4847.74] the son of God given for me.
[4847.74 → 4854.74] My debt he pays and my debt he dies,
[4854.74 → 4866.74] that I, I did, that I, I did.
[4866.74 → 4883.56] And now this love of Christ shall flow like rivers.
[4883.56 → 4890.56] Come wash your guilt away,
[4890.56 → 4896.56] live again.
[4896.56 → 4902.56] Amazing love for what sacrifice,
[4902.56 → 4908.56] the son of God given for me.
[4908.56 → 4915.56] My debt he pays and my debt he dies,
[4915.56 → 4929.56] that I, I did, that I, I did.

[5553.68 → 5558.40] Praise how sweet the sound
[5558.40 → 5565.84] That saved a wretch like me
[5565.84 → 5569.92] I once was lost
[5569.92 → 5573.64] But now am found
[5573.64 → 5579.36] Was blind, but now I see
[5579.36 → 5588.48] T'was grace that longed my heart to fear
[5588.48 → 5594.70] And grace my fears relieved
[5594.70 → 5603.40] How precious did that grace appear
[5603.40 → 5608.86] The hour I first believed
[5608.86 → 5617.98] The Lord has promised good to me
[5617.98 → 5623.98] His word my hope secures
[5623.98 → 5631.98] He will my shield and portion be
[5631.98 → 5641.10] As long as life can go
[5641.10 → 5648.14] Through many dangers, toils and snares
[5648.14 → 5657.26] I have already come
[5657.26 → 5664.38] And grace hath brought me safe thus far
[5664.38 → 5671.50] And grace will lead me home
[5671.50 → 5679.66] When we've been there ten thousand years
[5679.66 → 5686.78] Like shining as the sun
[5686.78 → 5690.62] We've known as days
[5690.62 → 5694.18] To sing God's grace
[5694.18 → 5699.66] Than when we have first begun
[5699.66 → 5704.78] I have already come
[5704.78 → 5708.78] And grace will lead me home
[5708.78 → 5711.90] God sent his Son
[5711.90 → 5721.02] God sent his Son
[5721.02 → 5730.14] They called him Jesus
[5730.14 → 5740.14] He came to love
[5740.14 → 5749.26] Heal and forbid
[5749.26 → 5751.26] Heal and forbid
[5751.26 → 5753.26] He fled and died
[5753.26 → 5754.26] Heal and forbid
[5754.26 → 5754.50] Heal and forbid
[5754.50 → 5756.38] But empty grave is there
[5756.38 → 5760.38] To prove my Saviour lives
[5760.38 → 5761.50] Because he lives
[5761.50 → 5763.50] Because he lives
[5763.50 → 5766.50] I can face tomorrow
[5766.50 → 5769.50] Because he lives
[5769.50 → 5771.62] All fear is gone
[5771.62 → 5773.62] All fear is gone
[5773.62 → 5776.62] Because I know
[5776.62 → 5779.62] He holds a future
[5779.62 → 5780.74] And life is gone
[5780.74 → 5783.74] And life is worth the living
[5783.74 → 5786.74] Just because he lives
[5786.74 → 5790.74] How sweet to hold
[5790.74 → 5793.74] A newborn baby
[5793.74 → 5796.74] And feel the pride
[5796.74 → 5799.74] And joy he gives
[5799.74 → 5803.74] But greater still
[5803.74 → 5806.74] The calm assurance
[5806.74 → 5808.94] His love can face
[5808.94 → 5809.86] In certain days
[5809.86 → 5810.86] Because he lives
[5810.86 → 5812.86] Because he lives
[5812.86 → 5815.86] Because he lives
[5815.86 → 5818.98] I can face tomorrow
[5818.98 → 5823.02] Because he lives
[5823.02 → 5826.22] All fear is gone
[5826.22 → 5828.66] Because I know
[5828.66 → 5832.16] He holds a future
[5832.16 → 5835.80] And life is worth the living
[5835.80 → 5837.80] Just because he lives
[5837.80 → 5838.96] Just because he lives
[5838.96 → 5841.80] And then one day
[5841.80 → 5844.80] I'll cross that river
[5844.80 → 5847.80] I'll fight my smile
[5847.80 → 5851.80] No more with me
[5851.80 → 5854.80] And then as death
[5854.80 → 5857.80] Gives way to victory
[5857.80 → 5861.96] I'll see the lights of glory
[5861.96 → 5862.96] And I'll know
[5862.96 → 5863.96] I'll know
[5863.96 → 5865.24] He lives
[5865.24 → 5867.96] Because he lives
[5867.96 → 5871.20] I can face tomorrow
[5871.20 → 5873.96] Because he lives
[5873.96 → 5878.30] All fear is gone
[5878.30 → 5879.96] Because I know
[5879.96 → 5883.96] He holds a future
[5883.96 → 5886.96] And life is worth the living
[5886.96 → 5887.12] And life is worth the living
[5887.12 → 5888.96] Just because he lives
[5888.96 → 5889.96] Just because he lives
[5889.96 → 5891.96] Because he lives
[5891.96 → 5892.96] Because he lives
[5892.96 → 5896.96] I can face tomorrow
[5896.96 → 5898.96] Because he lives
[5898.96 → 5901.96] All fear is gone
[5901.96 → 5903.96] All fear is gone
[5903.96 → 5906.96] Because I know
[5906.96 → 5907.96] He holds a future
[5907.96 → 5913.96] And life is worth the living
[5913.96 → 5916.96] Just because he lives
[5916.96 → 5917.96] Because he lives
[5917.96 → 5918.96] Because he lives
[5918.96 → 5919.96] Because he lives
[5919.96 → 5935.96] Because he lives
[5935.96 → 5937.96] Drink and believe
[5937.96 → 5939.96] He lives
[5939.96 → 5944.96] About two

[5964.96 → 5966.56] Doug
[5966.56 → 5981.20] I should have said this before that last table,
[5981.44 → 5982.30] but I didn't know.
[5982.54 → 5983.48] That was the last table.
[5984.24 → 5985.52] So if you haven't been served yet,
[5985.58 → 5986.42] but would like to be,
[5986.90 → 5988.16] you can come to the front now.
[5994.86 → 5995.30] Amen.
[5996.56 → 5997.50] What a feast.
[5997.50 → 6000.40] Thank you for joining us in that.
[6001.98 → 6003.68] Let's pray, shall we?
[6010.80 → 6011.96] Amazing God,
[6012.30 → 6015.64] you come into our ordinary lives
[6015.64 → 6019.08] and set a holy table among us,
[6020.24 → 6022.20] filling our plates with the bread of life
[6022.20 → 6024.60] and our cups with salvation.
[6024.60 → 6027.58] Send us out now
[6027.58 → 6033.08] in the power and majesty of your resurrection.
[6034.28 → 6038.60] Send us out now with tenderheartedness
[6038.60 → 6040.96] to touch an ordinary world
[6040.96 → 6045.38] with the promise of your extraordinary holiness.
[6045.38 → 6050.56] send us out to all the nations.
[6051.44 → 6054.40] In the power of Christ's resurrection, we pray.
[6055.50 → 6055.92] Amen.
[6055.92 → 6060.70] I'm going to invite you to stand for our closing blessing.
[6060.70 → 6082.32] May God, in the power that raised Christ from the dead, go before you to guide you.
[6083.20 → 6088.86] May God, in the power that raised Christ from the dead, go behind you to protect you.
[6088.86 → 6095.06] May God, in the power that raised Christ from the dead, go beneath you to support you.
[6095.38 → 6100.88] And may God, in the power that raised Christ from the dead, go beside you to befriend you.
[6101.18 → 6105.48] Do not be afraid. Christ is risen.
[6106.10 → 6110.94] Do not be afraid. Christ is risen indeed.
[6111.36 → 6113.80] And all God's people said, Amen.
[6118.86 → 6119.86] Amen.

[6964.52 → 6970.24] Now at His feet we bow
[6970.24 → 6981.14] The one who wore our sin and shame
[6981.14 → 6985.34] Now robed in majesty
[6985.34 → 6992.50] The radiance of perfect love
[6992.50 → 6997.34] Now shines for all to see
