[1169.88 → 1199.86] Thank you.
[1199.86 → 1229.84] Thank you.
[1229.86 → 1259.84] He became,
[1259.86 → 1289.84] Jesus, Jesus.
[1289.86 → 1319.84] Thank you.
[1319.86 → 1349.84] Thank you.
[1349.86 → 1379.86] Thank you.
[1379.86 → 1409.84] Thank you.
[1409.86 → 1439.84] Jesus, Jesus.
[1439.86 → 1469.84] Jesus, Jesus, Lord of all.
[1469.84 → 1499.84] He's from 2,
[1499.84 → 1529.84] and He has,
[1529.84 → 1553.84] I know not why God's wondrous grace to me, he has made known,
[1553.84 → 1565.20] nor why unworthy Christ in love redeem me for his own.
[1565.84 → 1575.76] But I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able
[1575.76 → 1586.76] to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day.
[1588.12 → 1597.76] I know not how his saving faith to me, he did impart,
[1597.76 → 1609.08] nor how believing in his work brought peace within my heart.
[1609.62 → 1618.76] But I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able
[1618.76 → 1630.62] to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day.
[1630.62 → 1641.74] I know not how the Spirit moves convincing us of sin.
[1641.74 → 1652.62] Revealing Jesus through the word, creating faith in him.
[1652.62 → 1663.26] But I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able
[1663.26 → 1674.56] to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day.
[1674.56 → 1685.50] I know not what a good or ill may be reserved for me.
[1685.50 → 1695.50] Of weary ways or golden days before his face I see.
[1695.50 → 1706.78] But I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able
[1706.78 → 1718.00] to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day.
[1725.50 → 1752.46] Who am I that the highest king would welcome me?
[1752.46 → 1757.46] I was lost, but he brought me ill.
[1757.46 → 1761.46] His love for you.
[1761.46 → 1765.46] Oh, his love for you.
[1765.46 → 1769.46] Who the sun sets free.
[1769.46 → 1774.46] Oh, it's free indeed.
[1774.46 → 1775.46] I'm a child of God.
[1775.46 → 1776.46] Yes, I am.
[1776.46 → 1777.46] I'm a child of God.
[1777.46 → 1781.46] Yes, I am.
[1781.46 → 1787.46] Free of last he has ransomed me.
[1787.46 → 1791.46] His grace runs me.
[1791.46 → 1799.46] While I was a slave to say, Jesus died for me.
[1799.46 → 1804.46] Yes, he died for me.
[1804.46 → 1808.46] Who the sun sets free.
[1808.46 → 1812.46] Oh, it's free indeed.
[1812.46 → 1816.46] I'm a child of God.
[1816.46 → 1820.46] Yes, I am.
[1820.46 → 1825.46] In my Father's house.
[1825.46 → 1829.46] There's a place for me.
[1829.46 → 1833.46] I'm a child of God.
[1833.46 → 1838.46] Yes, I am.
[1838.46 → 1843.46] I am chosen, not forsaken.
[1843.46 → 1847.46] I am who you say I am.
[1847.46 → 1851.46] You are for me, not against me.
[1851.46 → 1855.46] I am who you say I am.
[1855.46 → 1876.46] I am who you say I am.
[1876.46 → 1880.46] Who the sun sets free.
[1880.46 → 1885.46] Oh, it's free indeed.
[1885.46 → 1889.46] I'm a child of God.
[1889.46 → 1893.46] Yes, I am.
[1893.46 → 1897.46] In my Father's house.
[1897.46 → 1901.46] There's a place for me.
[1901.46 → 1906.46] I'm a child of God.
[1906.46 → 1910.46] Yes, I am.
[1910.46 → 1914.46] In my Father's house.
[1914.46 → 1919.46] There's a place for me.
[1919.46 → 1923.46] I'm a child of God.
[1923.46 → 1927.46] Yes, I am.
[1927.46 → 1929.46] You may have a seat.
[1957.46 → 1964.46] Good morning, everyone.
[1964.46 → 1969.46] Before I get started, our beautiful brand-new chairs that we have.
[1969.46 → 1975.46] If you look at the chair in front of you, there are giving envelopes and some of the seats.
[1975.46 → 1979.46] And also some other information.
[1979.46 → 1984.46] Today's offerings are for the church's ministries and missions.
[1984.46 → 1989.46] The special offering today is for Diaconal Ministries Canada.
[1989.46 → 1996.46] They partner with the Christian Reformed Church in North America to promote diaconal work in Canada.
[1996.46 → 2006.46] The deacons serve by leading and equipping the church to minister to its members and the world in many different ministries.
[2006.46 → 2023.46] Relying on the Holy Spirit, Diaconal Ministries Canada helps to inspire, empower, and equip deacons as they work to move their churches to join in God's transforming work in communities across Canada.
[2023.46 → 2042.46] In imitation of Christ's mercy, deacons are to teach us to love God, our neighbours, and the creation with acts of generous sharing, joyful hospitality, thoughtful care, and wise stewardship of all God's gifts.
[2042.46 → 2047.46] Next week's offerings are for the church budget and special offering of the church budget.
[2047.46 → 2051.46] The special offering is Cubic Campus Reformed Okanagan.
[2051.46 → 2055.46] It supports the chaplaincy of UBC Okanagan.
[2055.46 → 2061.32] In the
[2061.46 → 2065.46] Chankervais
[2065.46 → 2068.96] lab
[2070.46 → 2072.36] Markov
[2072.46 → 2076.46] Direct recommendations
[2076.46 → 2082.96] The
[2082.96 → 2112.94] Thank you.
[2112.96 → 2142.94] Thank you.
[2142.96 → 2172.94] Thank you.
[2172.96 → 2202.94] Thank you.
[2202.96 → 2232.94] Thank you.
[2232.94 → 2234.94] Thank you.
[2262.94 → 2264.94] Thank you.
[2266.18 → 2266.86] Oh boy.
[2267.08 → 2268.38] I mean, like I do a lot of coaching.
[2268.48 → 2272.14] In this situation, I'd be subbing you guys out and bringing some kids off the bench and
[2272.14 → 2273.88] to do a little bit of cheering for me.
[2274.10 → 2274.44] All right.
[2274.54 → 2275.08] Nice job.
[2275.48 → 2279.28] Today, we are going to, in children's worship time, we're going to talk about trust.
[2279.28 → 2281.94] Have any of you guys ever heard that word before, trust?
[2283.86 → 2284.38] Have you?
[2285.38 → 2290.58] How about, do you think anyone here in this little group here could put that word trust in a sentence?
[2290.58 → 2298.36] Let's get some head nodding, but not too many offering.
[2298.92 → 2300.76] It's kind of a big person word, isn't it?
[2300.92 → 2304.70] Sometimes parents use that kind of word, and you hear it a lot with adults.
[2304.80 → 2306.88] But anyway, we are going to talk about trust today.
[2306.96 → 2311.46] But before we do that, I got a couple slides up on the screen that I want you guys to look at.
[2311.50 → 2313.10] We're going to talk a little bit about trust.
[2313.68 → 2316.88] I'm going to use them in a sentence and see if that makes sense.
[2317.16 → 2317.48] All right.
[2317.70 → 2318.34] First one.
[2319.98 → 2325.54] So if you were falling off a cliff and somebody, that guy in the white shirt there, would you
[2325.54 → 2330.76] put your trust in him to get you back up onto the cliff edge?
[2330.76 → 2331.04] Yeah?
[2331.64 → 2332.22] That would be good.
[2332.36 → 2332.92] You wouldn't?
[2334.10 → 2335.48] That might be all you got.
[2335.60 → 2337.12] So you're going to have to trust that guy.
[2337.42 → 2337.70] All right.
[2337.76 → 2338.26] Next one.
[2338.26 → 2343.48] If you were, when you were little, do you remember when sometimes you would jump into
[2343.48 → 2344.46] your dad's arms?
[2344.78 → 2346.34] Were you trusting him to catch you?
[2346.94 → 2347.34] Yeah.
[2347.58 → 2347.96] All right.
[2348.04 → 2348.88] How about the next one?
[2349.96 → 2353.06] So have any of you probably seen a little bit of this kind of stuff on TV?
[2353.20 → 2357.98] That gal there who's letting go of that one rope there, jumping into the arms of the guy
[2357.98 → 2360.42] there, do you think she's putting a lot of trust into that guy there?
[2360.94 → 2361.18] Yeah?
[2361.44 → 2363.00] Anybody like here want to try that?
[2364.60 → 2365.00] Yes.
[2365.18 → 2365.60] All right.
[2365.60 → 2366.32] Next one.
[2366.32 → 2368.74] How about that?
[2368.82 → 2369.84] Has that ever happened to you?
[2370.04 → 2374.80] I'm sure your dad or an uncle or a grandpa has done this to you on a dock somewhere on
[2374.80 → 2375.20] a lake.
[2375.40 → 2377.68] Try to almost throw you in, but you got to hang on there.
[2378.86 → 2380.96] So she's putting a lot of trust into that, guys.
[2382.88 → 2383.24] Yeah.
[2383.84 → 2384.40] Next one.
[2385.40 → 2385.86] How about this?
[2385.90 → 2387.70] Anybody ever done a trust fall yet?
[2388.38 → 2388.64] Yeah?
[2388.70 → 2389.32] You've done those?
[2390.06 → 2391.50] That's a good example of trust.
[2391.98 → 2393.22] And do I have one more there?
[2394.44 → 2395.18] How about that?
[2395.18 → 2398.76] When you're the guy, people who are skydiving, jumping out of planes and stuff, they're putting
[2398.76 → 2399.48] a lot of trust in.
[2399.52 → 2400.10] What's that thing?
[2400.18 → 2401.00] That's that red thing.
[2401.06 → 2401.78] What's that thing called?
[2402.12 → 2402.80] A parachute.
[2403.08 → 2403.40] Yes.
[2403.72 → 2404.90] And I think there might be one more.
[2406.52 → 2408.76] And this happens quite a bit too when you're little.
[2408.86 → 2412.58] Your dad or your uncle or grandpa or maybe even your mom throws you up in the air and
[2412.58 → 2413.04] catches you.
[2413.10 → 2415.98] You're putting a lot of trust in your mom or whoever's catching you, right?
[2415.98 → 2417.84] So there are some examples of trust.
[2417.92 → 2420.76] But today we're going to talk about Abraham and Sarah.
[2421.90 → 2426.82] And Abraham had to trust in God because he was ancient.
[2427.06 → 2430.18] And God said, I'm going to make you a father of many nations.
[2430.18 → 2431.82] And he was not so sure about it.
[2431.86 → 2432.88] So we're going to talk about that.
[2433.36 → 2435.36] But before we do that, we're going to give the blessing.
[2435.48 → 2438.80] So if we can get you guys to stand up and all the people out there to stand up, we'll
[2438.80 → 2439.42] do the blessing.
[2439.42 → 2442.66] This time, kids, we've got to be loud.
[2443.34 → 2443.50] Okay?
[2444.56 → 2447.32] The Lord be with you.
[2447.98 → 2449.36] And all with you.
[2449.54 → 2450.16] Nice work.
[2469.42 → 2479.50] My name is Rob, and I will be leading us in the family prayer this morning.
[2480.66 → 2486.02] Recently, we heard a series of messages in September on our church's mission statement.
[2486.02 → 2489.06] And I'd like to pick up on that theme again today.
[2489.80 → 2490.48] Let's pray.
[2491.94 → 2492.46] Gather.
[2493.46 → 2497.36] We recognize what a privilege we have to gather today.
[2497.36 → 2502.08] We've come this morning from homes and our scattered communities and travelled together
[2502.08 → 2503.74] to this time and place.
[2504.36 → 2510.38] If we had a time-lapse tracking app, it would be fascinating to watch us converge in this
[2510.38 → 2516.90] place, spread apart a few hours ago and going along various trails to meet together in this
[2516.90 → 2517.70] central house.
[2518.44 → 2524.96] We come here for many reasons, but most importantly, we come here to honour you, to worship you.
[2524.96 → 2528.02] You are our God, and we are your people.
[2528.90 → 2530.32] You created the universe.
[2530.64 → 2532.02] You sustained all things.
[2532.56 → 2533.42] But who are we?
[2534.74 → 2538.16] Ordinary collection of people with the common struggles of humanity.
[2539.36 → 2541.86] Some of us are in mourning.
[2542.24 → 2549.70] We think of Joan and Jared and the Roberts and the Klosterhof and Murder families and other
[2549.70 → 2553.24] families who are mourning the loss of loved ones.
[2554.26 → 2555.42] Some of us are worn.
[2555.92 → 2556.50] Some stuck.
[2556.92 → 2557.60] Some broken.
[2558.32 → 2559.12] Some in despair.
[2560.32 → 2562.18] Yet others who are healing.
[2562.82 → 2564.04] There are some of us that are growing.
[2564.28 → 2565.10] Some that are thriving.
[2566.10 → 2568.30] But all of us, all of us are forgiven.
[2568.64 → 2569.80] All of us are cared for.
[2570.56 → 2572.76] And all of us are your children.
[2572.76 → 2578.60] As we sang, as we just sang, I am who you say I am.
[2579.84 → 2582.32] And who are we in comparison to your magnitude?
[2583.52 → 2590.34] We're appreciative that we can gather in a sanctuary that only recently was renovated and brightened up.
[2590.76 → 2592.32] And now we have these new chairs.
[2593.22 → 2595.34] Those old chairs supported many people.
[2595.78 → 2596.58] Countless stories.
[2596.58 → 2599.90] May these new chairs also wear out too.
[2601.04 → 2602.80] Seating a new generation of believers.
[2603.48 → 2604.12] Resting in you.
[2605.32 → 2607.54] Some of us gather here in person.
[2608.04 → 2609.26] Some of us online.
[2611.10 → 2618.56] It's another dimension to our Catholic Universal Church that now spans not just time, location, but now technology.
[2618.56 → 2624.90] For those connected online, we pray that you too will be connected.
[2625.84 → 2631.20] That you will also be devoted to the Apostles' teaching, to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread, and to prayer.
[2632.54 → 2635.54] Later, we'll gather around the Lord's Supper table.
[2636.36 → 2642.78] As we come, group by croup, Lord, we pray that you inspire our memories of this memorial feast.
[2642.78 → 2648.90] May we look around at those we break bread with and be encouraged by our fellow saints.
[2651.32 → 2651.84] Grow.
[2652.30 → 2655.72] We recognize what a privilege we have to grow this morning.
[2656.58 → 2659.74] We praise you with the music of our songs.
[2660.20 → 2661.86] We sang about the Ancient of Days.
[2662.48 → 2664.26] We submit to you in our confession.
[2664.26 → 2673.84] As much as our society tells us that we're not, and that we can fix ourselves, we know that we are in the wrong, and our help comes from you.
[2674.86 → 2676.22] We give to you our offerings.
[2676.66 → 2682.54] Thank you for the blessing of the Diaconal Ministries, and that we can be a part of this network across Canada.
[2684.08 → 2686.92] Thank you that we can learn through your word.
[2687.66 → 2693.50] We live in an awfully unbalanced world, and we depend on you to recentre us.
[2694.26 → 2700.52] We praise you for the span of emotions of the Psalms, these words so long preserved.
[2701.30 → 2702.82] They still speak to us today.
[2703.90 → 2708.46] Open our hearts and minds to this morning's message as we speak on shame.
[2709.58 → 2713.26] Speak through our misery that we may enter your majesty.
[2714.32 → 2717.98] Father, we pray for those who enthusiastically left for children's worship.
[2718.96 → 2720.98] May they be inspired to grow in their faith.
[2720.98 → 2725.02] Come to an understanding of who you are and who they are in you.
[2726.46 → 2730.06] Father, there are days we just go through the motions in our worship.
[2730.40 → 2731.26] Church can be a habit.
[2732.04 → 2732.98] It's so much more.
[2733.48 → 2740.16] But we pray that even in those habits, that they nurture our faith, and that we'll be roused from our apathy,
[2740.36 → 2742.96] and that in the long run that we will grow.
[2744.50 → 2744.90] Go.
[2744.90 → 2748.70] We recognize what a privilege we have to go this morning.
[2749.72 → 2753.56] May our Sunday be a rest in you, and Monday a continued of our worship today.
[2754.50 → 2758.84] Father, we pray for those specifically in our church.
[2759.94 → 2767.60] We think of Sylvia in Maryland this week and their roles, often behind the scenes doing things that most of us are oblivious to,
[2767.60 → 2774.24] whether that's doing things like reconciling a bank statement or putting together these automated emails that magically appear.
[2775.02 → 2777.62] We thank you for their work, Lord, and we pray that you bless it.
[2778.00 → 2781.96] We pray for grace doing the work that, by definition, we don't notice it.
[2782.88 → 2787.16] Father, we pray for our pastors and elders as they provide spiritual leadership.
[2787.68 → 2790.92] For the deacons as they connect with people and address their needs.
[2791.96 → 2794.84] Father, we pray for the upcoming congregational meeting.
[2794.84 → 2799.82] May it be a real enabler for the ministry going forward next year.
[2800.82 → 2805.12] We think of the Faith and Work Seminar happening this week for the youth.
[2805.54 → 2809.80] Lord, we pray that they may be inspired and see possibilities.
[2810.56 → 2813.56] Thank you for the connections that can be built with other churches, too.
[2814.68 → 2819.14] Father, we pray for the usher meeting, for the upcoming abuse prevention training later in November.
[2820.12 → 2823.34] Father, we pray for the care groups that are meeting this week.
[2823.34 → 2829.80] That these groups, too, will be devoted to the apostles' teaching, to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread, to prayer.
[2831.48 → 2836.82] As we go from this place, we pray that we may use the time that you have given us.
[2837.36 → 2839.78] That we may use the talents you have given us.
[2840.20 → 2842.44] That we may use the treasure you have given us.
[2842.44 → 2848.08] That these things might be used to make a difference in your kingdom.
[2849.74 → 2854.12] Father, as we go from here again today, as we re-scatter amongst our communities,
[2854.88 → 2857.54] may we carry a bit of this fellowship with us.
[2858.08 → 2863.04] And a lot of your light into this week, wherever we go and whatever we do.
[2863.82 → 2866.66] In all these things, we pray in your name.
[2867.00 → 2867.22] Amen.
[2872.44 → 2873.44] Amen.
[2892.74 → 2896.74] Can I just say that it's perfect to be with you again.
[2896.74 → 2903.12] if you're visiting with us my name is Chris I didn't say that at the beginning I'm one of the
[2903.12 → 2908.56] pastors here but the last couple of weeks I've been in other places in Mexico and then in Abbotsford
[2908.56 → 2917.16] for an ordination and yeah two weeks away and being back with you this morning in worship
[2917.16 → 2925.00] I'm just blessed to be amongst you and with you and so grateful that this can be our community together
[2925.00 → 2932.76] we are indeed going to continue in our series on the Psalms in just a moment we're going to read
[2932.76 → 2938.32] from Psalm 44 and so if you have a Bible I encourage you to open that up you can find Psalm 44
[2938.32 → 2946.66] read along with me and then keep it open or keep it on in front of you if it's a device that you use
[2946.66 → 2953.92] before I get into the text just a little introduction to our topic this morning
[2953.92 → 2962.58] now as many of you know I have two kids and whenever I use my kids as an illustration in
[2962.58 → 2968.36] a sermon Nora always grabs me after church my daughter, and she says dad you owe me a dollar
[2968.36 → 2974.18] because one time she heard a pastor say whenever I use my kids in an illustration I pay them a dollar
[2974.18 → 2978.96] and she thinks that I have to do that now my family's not here today because Nora's at home
[2978.96 → 2989.14] six so this one's for free some time ago I don't exactly remember when but we were living here so
[2989.14 → 2995.24] it's within the last couple of years anyway Rachel and I were in the kitchen we were doing dishes or we
[2995.24 → 3002.48] were sitting at the island just chatting together when from the distance I hear Nora shout ow
[3002.48 → 3011.46] and then we hear the little feet of Malachi her younger brother running out of her room and stopping
[3011.46 → 3020.22] we go what did he do now you know how little boys can be, so I went down the hall to see what was going
[3020.22 → 3025.96] on I found Nora, and she said that they were playing in their room and Malachi got excited, and he hit her
[3025.96 → 3034.42] and then he ran away so I went to his room to try and find him I opened the door and I said Malachi
[3034.42 → 3043.46] are you in here and I didn't hear him or see him, and so I said well I don't think he ran away
[3043.46 → 3048.28] further than this, so I went into the room one more time and I called out again Malachi
[3048.28 → 3055.82] where are you and I didn't hear anything, so I turned to leave when behind me, I heard a small
[3055.82 → 3063.94] shuffle coming from under the bed, and so I knelt down on the ground and I had lifted the blanket
[3063.94 → 3072.60] and I said Malachi where are you and there he was hiding in the corner of his bed in the corner of his
[3072.60 → 3083.42] room underneath with his shirt pulled up over his head and his back to me I said Malachi come, come out
[3083.42 → 3090.46] come to me, and he let me slowly pull him out, and I gathered him up, and we sat down on his bed and I said
[3090.46 → 3102.52] what's going on buddy it's like I hit Nora, and I was sad, so I ran away, and I hid because I
[3102.52 → 3110.40] didn't know what you were going to do and so my heart breaks at that moment for him, and we sit and
[3110.40 → 3117.88] we chat, and we talk and what I help him see is that he ran away not because he was sad that was his word
[3117.88 → 3123.98] for an emotion that he didn't know how to name the emotion he didn't know how to name was shame
[3123.98 → 3132.18] he felt shame that he had done something and that shame caused him to hide from his father
[3132.18 → 3142.16] who went searching for him and said where are you this morning we are going to talk about
[3142.16 → 3149.14] shame now in our series on faith and all our feelings through the book of psalms we've gathered
[3149.14 → 3154.44] up a bunch of different emotions and experiences of emotions and so today I want to
[3154.44 → 3161.58] wrestle with you for a moment on shame what it is and how do we respond to it and to do that
[3161.58 → 3168.68] we're going to look at psalm 44 we're going to read verse 9 through 17
[3168.68 → 3180.80] and I'm really going to focus in on verse 15 16 and 17 now I say that, but we will end in the
[3180.80 → 3187.08] rest of the psalm as well but that will be the lens through which we look at shame before we read
[3187.08 → 3192.32] that together I want to give you what I hope can be our goal the sort of theme under which we will
[3192.32 → 3198.70] operate this is where I hope we will come to land together so I want to give you the destination so
[3198.70 → 3205.92] that along the journey you know where we're going that is this the reality of shame makes us hide
[3205.92 → 3216.02] but instead of hiding from we can run to God and then what we will find is a God who has already
[3216.02 → 3224.68] come to us so the reality of shame makes us hide but instead of hiding from we can run to God and
[3224.68 → 3236.56] what we will find is a God who has already come to us and so with that let's read psalm 44 starting at verse 9
[3236.56 → 3248.30] but now you have rejected and humbled us you no longer go out with our armies you made us retreat
[3248.30 → 3255.60] before the enemy and our adversaries have plundered us you gave us up to be devoured like sheep and have
[3255.60 → 3262.88] scattered us amongst the nations you sold your people for a pittance gaining nothing from their sale you have
[3262.88 → 3269.88] made us a reproach to our neighbours the scorn and derision of those around us, you have made us a byword amongst
[3269.88 → 3281.06] the nations the peoples shake their head at us, I live in disgrace all day long and my face is covered with shame
[3281.06 → 3289.12] at the taunts of those who reproach and revile me because of the enemy who is bent on revenge
[3289.12 → 3299.14] all this came upon us though we had not forgotten you we had not been false to your covenant
[3299.14 → 3301.28] this is the word of the Lord
[3301.28 → 3311.38] now in this series that we have been working on in addition to particular psalms we have been using
[3311.38 → 3319.12] the book by Allende and Longman the cry of the soul and in their chapter on shame which I think might
[3319.12 → 3325.44] be the best chapter in the book in case you're waiting for a review, and they write to be covered in
[3325.44 → 3334.72] shame is to feel the self engulfed in something disgusting even hideous and the experience of
[3334.72 → 3346.02] shame feels like a prolonged and torturous death now I named that at the beginning because what I'm aware
[3346.02 → 3356.82] of and what I'm concerned for is that as we discuss shame as you begin to feel and hold up the sorts of
[3356.82 → 3363.84] things that you are ashamed about in your own life or the kinds of shame that we carry as we sort of
[3363.84 → 3373.94] expose those feelings to the light of the gospel some of us might be scared some of us might be terrified
[3373.94 → 3381.14] at this sort of vulnerability that we are calling ourselves to and some of you may want a conversation
[3381.14 → 3389.78] or a follow-up or may need to talk to a counsellor or a pastor or an elder, and so I want to I want you
[3389.78 → 3396.40] to hear I am available for that pastor Kevin is available for that our elders are available for that
[3396.40 → 3404.28] right you can contact me and us you can reach out pastor Kevin is not here, but I know he also affirms
[3404.28 → 3414.90] this and wants this, so please please please even with the temptation to run and hide even with the
[3414.90 → 3423.34] temptation to dive under our metaphorical beds and pull our shirts up over our heads instead of that can we
[3423.34 → 3427.22] come together okay
[3427.22 → 3437.00] now before we talk about shame and in order to do that well we need to know the difference between shame
[3437.00 → 3446.12] and guilt all right what's the difference between shame and guilt and so to highlight that difference
[3446.12 → 3449.86] for us to make sure that we are on the right footing here we're going to do a little bit of biblical
[3449.86 → 3455.98] theology and really this is a moment of biblical counselling with you and, so please enter into this
[3455.98 → 3468.14] guilt is our real legal reality because of sin our real legal reality because of sin this is clear
[3468.14 → 3476.82] throughout the bible but here is just a quick sampling of a doctrine of sin for us right Romans 6
[3476.82 → 3486.12] the wages of sin is death there are none who are righteous not even one so all of us have sinned all have
[3486.12 → 3493.12] sinned and fallen short of the glory of God or James who says that whoever keeps the whole law yet stumbles at
[3493.12 → 3503.58] just one point is guilty of breaking it all right judgment followed once in uh and brought condemnation
[3503.58 → 3513.28] sin one trespass resulted in condemnation for all people in Colossians Paul defines the effects of sin
[3513.28 → 3520.32] as the charge of our legal indebtedness which stood against us and condemned us
[3520.32 → 3532.92] right sin and guilt is the real legal reality because of sin and apart from grace this is our shared reality
[3532.92 → 3539.02] right we are sinful we are depraved is one of the words that theologians have sometimes used we are guilty
[3539.02 → 3540.52] now
[3540.52 → 3550.70] so much of our culture our therapeutic culture doesn't like that truth, and so we don't usually
[3550.70 → 3557.28] focus on that first part of guilt instead we focus on the second part of guilt which is the feeling part
[3557.28 → 3564.40] and it's true because while there is this real legal reality to guilt there's also a felt reality
[3564.40 → 3572.68] to guilt right we sometimes feel guilty and the difference between guilt and shame is that that God
[3572.68 → 3581.44] will use our guilt and our feelings of guilt to drive us to himself in fact he will even send or give
[3581.44 → 3589.30] guilt or conviction of guilt by the Holy Spirit in order to drive us to him let me give you an example
[3589.30 → 3597.64] of what I mean some of you are familiar with the beautiful words of Heidelberg Catechism question
[3597.64 → 3603.24] and answer one right the question asks what is your only comfort in life and in death and then there's
[3603.24 → 3609.56] this beautiful summary that has that for hundreds of years been speaking truth and love to the church of
[3609.56 → 3615.86] Jesus in the reformed tradition that says that I am not my own but belong body and soul in life and in
[3615.86 → 3622.62] death to my faithful Saviour Jesus Christ by his precious blood he has set me free from the tyranny
[3622.62 → 3628.00] of the devil, and he also watches over me in such a way that not a hair can fall from my head without
[3628.00 → 3635.60] the will of my Father in heaven in fact all things must work together for my salvation because I belong to
[3635.60 → 3642.30] him Christ by his Holy Spirit assures me of eternal life and makes me wholeheartedly willing and ready
[3642.30 → 3656.70] from now on to live for him those are beautiful words how many of you know the second question
[3656.70 → 3664.24] of the catechism at the second question of the catechism, or you hear the first question and answer
[3664.24 → 3669.96] and you hear the beauty in it, and you go I want that that's the second question and the second
[3669.96 → 3677.84] question is what must I know to live and die in the joy of this comfort the joy of this comfort that's
[3677.84 → 3688.86] a spelling mistake on my end and then the answer given is three things one I must know how great my sin
[3688.86 → 3697.64] and misery are I must know my guilt and I must know how I am set free from all my sins and misery and
[3697.64 → 3706.32] then three how I am to thank God for such deliverance the teaching of the catechism here is in short if you
[3706.32 → 3715.78] want to know the joy and the comfort of the gospel it starts with the truth of our guilt and sin
[3715.78 → 3725.02] right the depth of our guilt makes so much more of the majesty and the compelling glory of Jesus and
[3725.02 → 3733.38] his gospel right our guilt reveals our need for grace which then together fuels our gratitude
[3733.38 → 3743.86] now again our culture and the world apart from redemption apart from the working of God and
[3743.86 → 3749.94] the Holy Spirit doesn't like that idea right the idea that we are all guilty and under wrath the
[3749.94 → 3757.92] idea that we are justly deserving of judgment doesn't fit with our cultural self-justifying anthropology
[3757.92 → 3764.62] right in our world today we see ourselves in the best light whether it's because of human pride or
[3764.62 → 3771.68] because we've finally made it in progress or the like now to be fair that idea that the world doesn't
[3771.68 → 3781.48] like this isn't a new thing right and so particularly for you young people who will live in the midst of
[3781.48 → 3791.78] this more explicitly than some of us older people hear this the world apart from God's revelation of
[3791.78 → 3799.50] himself apart from God's redeeming work in the Holy Spirit has never liked this truth in fact Jesus says
[3799.50 → 3806.86] that it goes even further than not liking it right in John 7 Jesus says that the world hates him
[3806.86 → 3812.34] because he testifies to the world that its works are evil
[3812.34 → 3819.52] and in John 17 Jesus takes this idea, and he draws a straight line, and he says that the world hates his
[3819.52 → 3829.12] disciples because they have been given the word of God to preach and that word starts with our sin and our
[3829.12 → 3839.38] just condemnation and so this is the context in which we find ourselves and like Jesus and like the first
[3839.38 → 3847.96] disciples part of the church's job then is to clear our guilt because of sin and to guide people towards
[3847.96 → 3861.06] God because like Isaiah says all our best efforts are filthy rags we can't do it and God will use our
[3861.06 → 3870.42] feelings of guilt to reveal the legal reality of being guilty we can't get away from it and as Christians
[3870.42 → 3873.94] we cannot be afraid of that part of the gospel
[3873.94 → 3882.12] because as we've seen in order to know the comfort and joy we must start with the sin and misery we must
[3882.12 → 3889.16] start with the guilt but now lets been making that distinction from guilt and shame let's come back to
[3889.16 → 3901.70] the major theme in this series in this psalm on shame then as a perversion of the way guilt can be used by God
[3901.70 → 3911.78] right so instead of guilt being a tool of God to draw us to himself our culture and even some of us
[3911.78 → 3921.04] sitting here this morning weaponizes shame to drive people away from community to drive people away from
[3921.04 → 3928.20] public spaces this is the root of the so-called cancel culture that is so prevalent and that it depends on
[3928.20 → 3935.88] the power of shame as the force that isolates and excludes the power of shame that forces people
[3935.88 → 3944.94] into hiding and personal shame does the same thing now I'm I mentioned at the beginning that our focus
[3944.94 → 3950.60] is from verse 15 to 17, and so I want you to see that and so please if you have bibles open
[3950.60 → 3958.36] look at that with me together because I think this is a good snapshot of our experience of shame
[3958.36 → 3968.20] and so the psalmist begins in verse 15 I live in disgrace all day long now one of the things that
[3968.20 → 3976.74] the shame voice does in our heads is that it constantly reminds us of our shame right literally
[3976.74 → 3984.96] in Hebrew that line says that all day long my humiliation my disgrace or my dishonour is in front
[3984.96 → 3996.70] of me right our shame becomes our fixation right it's all we see it fills our vision our idea of ourselves
[3996.70 → 4003.80] and it fills our idea of ourselves, and it becomes all that we are able to see and because that's how we see
[4003.80 → 4009.76] ourselves we begin to believe that that's the only way that people around us will ever see us
[4009.76 → 4018.52] again Alexander and Longman they say shame attacks the self in terms of identity
[4018.52 → 4026.14] I am a fill in the blank is the syntax of shame
[4026.14 → 4035.00] the psalmist goes on he says my face is covered with shame at the taunts of those who reproach and
[4035.00 → 4035.96] revile me
[4035.96 → 4048.16] shame makes us afraid of what others might say about us or more accurately our shame makes us
[4048.16 → 4054.88] believe that if they ever saw the real me if they ever saw the struggling me or the guilty me that they
[4054.88 → 4059.78] could never love me right that I would revile them or I would repel them
[4059.78 → 4067.96] and with all the pastoral sensitivity I can muster you know what I mean
[4067.96 → 4077.40] when I say that I have lived that and felt that and I'm sure that you have too
[4077.40 → 4088.58] and then the way that so many of us have learned to handle our shame is to dissociate from it right
[4088.58 → 4092.96] and by that I mean we blame someone else, or we bury it deeper
[4092.96 → 4102.32] the psalmist does the first he blames someone else and in fact the psalmist as we'll see he blames
[4102.32 → 4109.72] god look at what he says right all this came upon us verse 17 that is he felt all that
[4109.72 → 4116.32] shame all that reproach and revile though we had not forgotten you though we had not been false to
[4116.32 → 4122.30] your covenant right and with your bibles open we can keep going through there right um our hearts had
[4122.30 → 4129.66] not turned back our feet had not strayed, but you crushed us you covered us in darkness right what is
[4129.66 → 4136.00] the automatic default response of shame to blame someone else to blame god and then to call it an
[4136.00 → 4144.18] injustice right he does this at the beginning in verse 9 you have rejected us and humbled us and in
[4144.18 → 4149.40] fact in Hebrew the word that's used there is stronger than humbled right which sometimes in
[4149.40 → 4156.46] Christian circles we hold up as a virtue here it's its humiliated that you put us to shame
[4156.46 → 4162.42] then he goes on he says you made us retreat and our enemies have plundered us you gave us up to be
[4162.42 → 4169.76] devoured like sheep but here what the psalmist is doing in his shame he's making god the source
[4169.76 → 4172.48] now
[4172.48 → 4183.82] I'm going to say something here I'm going to slow down because I want you to hear it because I think the
[4183.82 → 4195.24] distinction is critical god is the source of their circumstance right that's what it means when we
[4195.24 → 4203.30] say god is sovereign god is the source of their circumstance, but he is not the source of the
[4203.30 → 4211.44] meaning that they make of their circumstance do you get what I mean when I make that distinction
[4211.44 → 4216.70] let me give let me give you an example so we've already talked about from the Heidelberg catechism
[4216.70 → 4221.42] that not a hair can fall from my head without the will of my father in heaven that's the sovereignty of
[4221.42 → 4233.44] god right but if I go bald and then I blame god for making me ugly because not a hair can fall from
[4233.44 → 4239.54] my head sorry all you bald men out there but if I blame god for making me ugly because I'm bald
[4239.54 → 4246.28] that I am making him the source of a meaning that I have made do you see the difference
[4246.28 → 4253.80] now maybe that's a rather inane example, but we do the same thing with more complex emotional
[4253.80 → 4259.98] realities and feelings and the meanings that we make around them for instance
[4259.98 → 4268.80] maybe I struggle with certain particular temptations, or maybe you struggle with certain
[4268.80 → 4276.22] particular temptations maybe it's sexual desires or jealousy or coveting whatever the complex emotion
[4276.22 → 4284.84] is the complex temptation is for you now we know right that that god allows temptations to come
[4284.84 → 4291.90] that he permits certain desires to continue even though they aren't a reflection of his design
[4291.90 → 4298.52] for creation but rather that they're the result of sin in the world and of all creation groaning
[4298.52 → 4304.60] under the weight of that sin right and part of why god does that is to show our need for him
[4304.60 → 4310.50] right to show our dependence on him to show that he provides a way out in the face of these things
[4310.50 → 4322.34] but if instead when we feel that temptation or when we have that desire, and we make the meaning that god gave
[4322.34 → 4328.74] it to me therefore it must be good therefore I must be allowed to act on it, we've made a meaning of our
[4328.74 → 4336.44] circumstances that attribute divine permission to the desire just because we feel that circumstance
[4336.44 → 4343.38] just because it's come about right and because god is sovereign over the circumstance we've taken the
[4343.38 → 4349.72] truth that god is sovereign over the circumstance, and we've conflated it with the meaning that I am
[4349.72 → 4354.30] making about the situation or the feelings I have about a situation
[4354.30 → 4363.62] no we don't need to parse all of that out and I hope that you can see that that conflation is actually
[4363.62 → 4369.94] applicable to so many more things than just our conversation around shame and the places that it
[4369.94 → 4378.82] happens in our lives but taking this truth and bringing it back around to shame and how we handle it
[4378.82 → 4388.62] what we do when we feel shame is make god responsible or at least we make someone else responsible as a proxy
[4388.62 → 4397.46] for god, and then it transforms what should be adding to our guilt right or should be increasing our shame
[4397.46 → 4404.70] and then we turn it into a virtue we end up redefining sin as something that the world celebrates or at least
[4404.70 → 4412.12] we try to do that we do it as a way to try to mitigate or lessen our experience of that shame
[4412.12 → 4416.32] and yet somehow it just doesn't seem to work
[4416.32 → 4420.50] now as I've said
[4420.50 → 4429.34] if one of the first things we do is to blame someone else second thing we do is to bury it deeper or by
[4429.34 → 4437.84] burying ourselves deeper we hide it, or we hide ourselves and again this gets right at the root of
[4437.84 → 4446.12] how shame functions in the cry of the soul the authors define shame as the traumatic exposure
[4446.12 → 4455.62] of nakedness and what is revealed we feel is an inner ugliness now this goes all the way back
[4455.62 → 4465.22] to chapter 3 of genesis right in the garden of Eden Adam and eve's first sin they eat the fruit of the tree
[4465.22 → 4470.76] that god told them not to eat and then god comes walking through the garden in the cool of the day
[4470.76 → 4473.44] we read, and he calls out for them, he says where are you
[4473.44 → 4482.92] and Adam hiding answers I heard you in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked
[4482.92 → 4484.48] so I hid
[4484.48 → 4487.60] now notice this about the story
[4487.60 → 4491.14] and Adam and eve have always been naked
[4491.14 → 4497.80] right they've always been naked in this story that symbolically right nothing is hidden from god
[4497.80 → 4505.62] he knows and has always known their nakedness it is their experience of their nakedness or more
[4505.62 → 4513.04] accurately it is the meaning that they make of their nakedness that makes them afraid and causes
[4513.04 → 4523.38] them to hide that's shame right guilt should drive them towards god towards him in his open arms shame
[4523.38 → 4532.18] makes them hide shame is the fear of being found out or exposed so we hide all right we've said it before
[4532.18 → 4538.74] and in fact pastor Kevin did an awesome job last week of restating this idea right that that one
[4538.74 → 4545.54] definition of hell and this goes all the way back to Augustine and to the apostle Paul before him
[4545.54 → 4550.18] one definition of hell is utter separation from god
[4550.18 → 4562.42] shame is like a self-imposed hell as we run and hide from god and from others for fear of what they might say of us
[4562.42 → 4569.14] now I know there's been a lot of quotes from the cry of the soul this morning
[4569.14 → 4574.18] but I want to give you one more maybe one more maybe two more but this one's so good
[4574.18 → 4583.94] they write shame is an acid that strips us of our dignity and dissolves hope
[4583.94 → 4594.56] no other emotion better portrays hell the utter loss of intimacy wonder and joy its corrosive effect
[4594.56 → 4601.12] is so strong that it can mould our souls and shake the shape the direction of our lives
[4601.12 → 4609.78] in the story of the fall right the rebellion against god Adam and eve hide in their shame and in fact
[4609.78 → 4614.74] if you know that story right when god finds them, and they come out what do they do
[4614.74 → 4625.10] they blame god right Adam says it's the woman he's not blaming the woman first because she is a proxy
[4625.10 → 4636.60] it's the woman you put me here with right this is your fault god right than eve he turns to eve and eve said
[4636.60 → 4643.56] it was the serpent right which again in the context is also blaming god right she doesn't know
[4643.56 → 4648.86] that the serpent is the devil in disguise we know that as the reader but to her, it's just another of
[4648.86 → 4659.00] the creatures that god made you made this thing it's your fault you put the temptation there it's your fault
[4659.00 → 4666.16] right they hide, and they blame others they blame god and when it comes to shame we have been doing the
[4666.16 → 4676.82] same thing ever since and so what are we supposed to do and how do we handle our shame now we've
[4676.82 → 4683.06] already mentioned how our culture likes to use shame or to weaponize shame and how many of us carry shame
[4683.06 → 4688.78] in different places and around different circumstances and with that or in response to that
[4688.78 → 4698.34] what our culture likes to do and teach is that the shame is generally understood as a poor self-esteem
[4698.34 → 4707.72] or a wrong self-image, or it's a misunderstanding of who you are so the cultural solution to shame
[4707.72 → 4715.06] is one to not do shameful things perhaps but even more than that right it's two it's to flip your
[4715.06 → 4721.38] understanding of yourself right because if it's ultimately about poor self-esteem what is needed
[4721.38 → 4729.92] is to increase our esteem right we need to take on a perspective that says that ultimately I'm not
[4729.92 → 4736.92] that bad right at times I do bad things perhaps but if I can wrap my head around the idea our culture
[4736.92 → 4743.34] tells us that I am essentially lovable and lovely and pure then I can live in the confidence of that
[4743.34 → 4749.18] understanding of myself rather than in the shame of an understanding based on poor self-esteem
[4749.18 → 4758.48] but if what the bible says about our guilt is true this real legal indebtedness right you can see that
[4758.48 → 4764.42] the bible is actually going to teach us something different about how to handle shame right the back
[4764.42 → 4769.84] the bible comes in and actually gives us what I believe to be a better and a more on a more accurate
[4769.84 → 4775.66] understanding of ourselves and our vision for ourselves in relationship to the world and in
[4775.66 → 4782.52] relationship to the god who created it and what I think the bible will come to show us is that our
[4782.52 → 4789.70] shame is ultimately, ultimately now, and we might do some work and might have to do some work to dig deep
[4789.70 → 4797.50] through it to see how this is so, but it's ultimately rooted in our preference to trust false gods
[4797.50 → 4805.64] rather than to depend on god for each and every moment of our existence again think of Adam and eve
[4805.64 → 4814.08] in the garden right all the serpent had to do was ask one question did god really say I don't know about
[4814.08 → 4820.66] you that's not a really convincing argument right it's not like he won them over by the logic of his
[4820.66 → 4828.06] words it was just a simple question and instead of trusting god they trusted that they could figure
[4828.06 → 4834.54] out better they trusted their own discernment right they made god nothing and made themselves or their
[4834.54 → 4842.56] intellect or their ability to discern they made that god when we feel or experience shame it means
[4842.56 → 4848.74] that somewhere along the way we have exchanged the truth of who god is for a lie
[4848.74 → 4856.64] maybe it was the idea that sexual fulfillment or sexual release would bring us deep joy
[4856.64 → 4864.76] but then it didn't maybe it's the idea that if I just had this thing or that thing or it just
[4864.76 → 4871.90] had this spouse or if I just had a child then I would be happy and so along the way in order to get
[4871.90 → 4878.06] that thing we compromised our values in order to accomplish it or achieve it, and then we got it
[4878.06 → 4888.56] and it didn't feel worth it is didn't satisfy like we thought it would you see shame reveals our idols
[4888.56 → 4894.58] and so how often then do we trust in our finances or in our health or in our reputation
[4894.58 → 4900.80] in children or in physical appearance or in some experience how often do we trust in those things to
[4900.80 → 4904.80] satisfy the longings of our souls more than god
[4904.80 → 4918.04] and even though these idols fail us over and over and shame is the consequence of that experience of
[4918.04 → 4924.54] failure it is the same shame that keeps us trapped in them or with them, and it's the same shame that
[4924.54 → 4931.86] keeps us going back to them and in some ways the shame and feeling shame is actually the easier
[4931.86 → 4938.42] response and the easier reality to live in the midst of because one it's familiar
[4938.42 → 4943.80] and we always have a tendency to stick with what we know
[4943.80 → 4952.44] and two shame has a tendency to close off our hearts to the penetrating truth of the gospel
[4952.44 → 4963.52] what if is instead of hiding from god that we humbled ourselves in confession
[4963.52 → 4969.32] and turned to him if instead we would look to god here's what we might see
[4969.32 → 4981.86] this is verse 23 the psalmist prays he cries out awake lord why do you sleep rouse yourself
[4981.86 → 4987.78] do not reject us why do you hide your face and forget our misery and oppression we are brought down
[4987.78 → 4997.86] to the dust and our bodies cling to the ground here it is risen up and help us rescue us because of your
[4997.86 → 5001.00] unfailing love
[5001.00 → 5004.94] the unfailing love
[5004.94 → 5007.98] unfailing love of god
[5007.98 → 5011.42] moves him to rescue
[5011.42 → 5013.40] his guilty
[5013.40 → 5015.06] people
[5015.06 → 5021.52] the unfailing love of god is what the psalmist relies on as he cries out
[5021.52 → 5023.44] to god right that's the first thing
[5023.44 → 5027.36] in his shame he cries out to god right he's been on a journey
[5027.36 → 5031.72] that gets him to this place where he can finally do that
[5031.72 → 5036.68] and in the end he cries out to god and because he comes
[5036.68 → 5042.78] to realize that it is finally only god who can help him
[5042.78 → 5044.64] and remember
[5044.64 → 5047.86] like in the garden of Eden right when Adam and eve
[5047.86 → 5052.20] hid notice it was god who first went looking
[5052.20 → 5053.18] for them
[5053.18 → 5056.42] right it was god who was walking through
[5056.42 → 5058.58] the garden and calling out to them
[5058.58 → 5060.44] it was god who was
[5060.44 → 5061.84] kneeling down
[5061.84 → 5063.90] beside lifting
[5063.90 → 5066.10] the blanket and saying where are you
[5066.10 → 5067.58] my son
[5067.58 → 5073.16] god is walking through the garden and when we turn to god
[5073.16 → 5077.36] we will see that he has moved towards us
[5077.36 → 5084.06] when we turn our hearts to god we will see Jesus and when we see Jesus when we see
[5084.06 → 5088.32] the one who lived the life I should have lived and the one who died the death that i
[5088.32 → 5095.52] deserve when we fix our eyes on Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith like the author to the letter of Hebrews says
[5095.52 → 5107.52] we see Jesus the one who for the joy set before him endured the cross scorning its shame and sat down at the right hand of the throne of god
[5107.52 → 5113.12] he scorned the shame of the cross so that you might know victory
[5113.12 → 5118.58] right true victory over not just your shame but your guilt
[5118.58 → 5126.54] true victory the bible has a different solution to our feelings of shame than the world will offer you
[5126.54 → 5131.64] the world will tell you that you are a good person, and you just need to think more highly of yourself
[5131.64 → 5133.00] the bible says
[5133.00 → 5134.44] that you not
[5134.44 → 5135.96] or you ought not to think
[5135.96 → 5140.24] more highly of yourselves but rather you must put others ahead of yourselves
[5140.24 → 5144.84] the bible holds up Jesus and the gospel as the only real solution
[5144.84 → 5146.30] to our shame
[5146.30 → 5151.04] right on the cross Jesus was willing to be shamed
[5151.04 → 5152.92] for you
[5152.92 → 5155.56] that is your value
[5155.56 → 5157.98] that is your identity
[5157.98 → 5162.76] remember your shame voice speaks against identity
[5162.76 → 5168.92] the gospel speaks a new identity over you
[5168.92 → 5174.32] a new identity in Jesus Christ one that
[5174.32 → 5181.02] transforms you by the power of the Holy Spirit by the renewing of your mind into the
[5181.02 → 5183.20] image of his son you
[5183.20 → 5184.84] by grace
[5184.84 → 5186.14] through faith
[5186.14 → 5187.30] are a new
[5187.30 → 5188.42] creation
[5188.42 → 5189.98] a lavishly
[5189.98 → 5190.82] loved
[5190.82 → 5191.90] child
[5191.90 → 5193.40] of the father
[5193.40 → 5195.80] that is who you are
[5195.80 → 5196.70] amen
[5196.70 → 5198.62] amen
[5198.62 → 5199.74] let's pray together
[5204.32 → 5209.06] lord our god
[5209.06 → 5216.38] help us to see who we are through your eyes
[5216.38 → 5224.82] god even in the truth of our guilt
[5224.82 → 5231.20] the truth of our sin and misery you have made new life possible
[5231.20 → 5243.70] by living on our behalf perfectly by dying on the cross in our place and by being raised three days later victorious over sin and death you now
[5243.70 → 5245.60] hand us
[5245.60 → 5247.72] new birth
[5247.72 → 5252.46] this is who we are
[5252.46 → 5257.86] and so god when that voice of shame rises up
[5257.86 → 5263.82] help us to press it back to push it away
[5263.82 → 5267.12] help us to cry out to you
[5267.12 → 5268.00] lord
[5268.00 → 5270.68] rise up and help us
[5270.68 → 5272.32] rescue us
[5272.32 → 5273.66] because of your
[5273.66 → 5275.06] unfailing
[5275.06 → 5276.02] love
[5276.02 → 5286.70] as we see the truth of your gospel more clearly this morning may we in it see the truth of who we are more clearly as well
[5286.70 → 5288.14] and may our hearts
[5288.14 → 5290.50] affections for you lord Jesus
[5290.50 → 5292.08] be stirred
[5292.08 → 5294.36] may our confidence be found
[5294.36 → 5295.30] in you
[5295.30 → 5298.02] may our eyes forever be fixed
[5298.02 → 5299.14] on
[5299.14 → 5300.12] you
[5300.12 → 5302.72] in Jesus name we pray
[5302.72 → 5304.20] amen
[5304.20 → 5311.02] as we fix our eyes on
[5311.02 → 5314.88] Jesus we have the opportunity to come together to the table
[5314.88 → 5316.32] of our lord
[5316.32 → 5318.40] this table will provide
[5318.40 → 5321.14] clarity of vision for us
[5321.14 → 5325.28] that we might see and hear from Jesus even as we
[5325.28 → 5327.40] taste and see that the lord
[5327.40 → 5328.32] is good
[5328.32 → 5334.88] as we come to this table we are going to move through a bit of a liturgy that's on the screen overhead
[5334.88 → 5340.36] there'll be parts for you to speak I encourage you to speak those as they come
[5340.36 → 5343.50] lift your hearts
[5343.50 → 5348.66] let us give thanks to the lord our god
[5348.66 → 5352.88] let's pray together
[5352.88 → 5367.10] with joy we praise you gracious god for you have created heaven and earth you've made us in your image, and you kept covenant with us even when we fell into sin
[5367.10 → 5376.70] we give you thanks for Jesus Christ who by his life death and resurrection opened to us the way of everlasting life
[5376.70 → 5377.42] life
[5377.42 → 5378.78] amen
[5378.78 → 5388.54] the lord Jesus before he suffered gave us this memorial of his sacrifice until he
[5388.54 → 5389.62] comes again
[5389.62 → 5392.54] the lord Jesus on the night that he was betrayed
[5392.54 → 5393.70] took bread
[5393.70 → 5396.18] and when he had given thanks
[5396.18 → 5397.74] he broke it and said
[5397.74 → 5399.22] this is my body
[5399.22 → 5400.42] which is for you
[5400.42 → 5401.74] do this
[5401.74 → 5402.66] in remembrance
[5402.66 → 5404.06] of me
[5404.06 → 5407.32] in the same way after supper
[5407.32 → 5408.96] he took the cup
[5408.96 → 5409.52] saying
[5409.52 → 5411.08] this cup
[5411.08 → 5412.40] is the new covenant
[5412.40 → 5413.96] in my blood
[5413.96 → 5416.54] do this
[5416.54 → 5418.38] in remembrance of me
[5418.38 → 5419.68] for whenever you eat
[5419.68 → 5420.92] and drink
[5420.92 → 5422.38] of this cup
[5422.38 → 5424.36] you proclaim the lord's death
[5424.36 → 5426.26] until he comes
[5426.26 → 5427.02] again
[5427.02 → 5428.20] this
[5428.20 → 5429.74] is the mystery
[5429.74 → 5431.24] of our faith
[5431.24 → 5436.64] resurrection
[5436.64 → 5437.78] we affirm
[5437.78 → 5438.40] with joy
[5438.40 → 5439.90] you're coming
[5439.90 → 5440.58] we await
[5440.58 → 5441.20] with hope
[5441.20 → 5442.60] you're going
[5442.60 → 5443.14] to be you
[5443.14 → 5444.04] lord Jesus
[5444.04 → 5446.20] church family
[5446.20 → 5447.98] the lord has prepared his table
[5447.98 → 5449.36] for all who love him
[5449.36 → 5451.62] and for all who trust in him alone
[5451.62 → 5452.86] for their salvation
[5452.86 → 5453.54] and so
[5453.54 → 5455.26] come to this table
[5455.26 → 5457.38] you who have much faith
[5457.38 → 5459.22] and you who would like to have more
[5459.22 → 5460.72] come to this table
[5460.72 → 5462.32] you who have been to this sacrament
[5462.32 → 5462.98] often
[5462.98 → 5465.90] and you who have not been for a long time
[5465.90 → 5468.06] you who have tried to follow Jesus
[5468.06 → 5470.14] and you who have failed
[5470.14 → 5471.42] come to this table
[5471.42 → 5474.84] because Jesus Christ is raised
[5474.84 → 5476.52] come if you are here
[5476.52 → 5478.46] or if you are online
[5478.46 → 5479.76] it is Christ
[5479.76 → 5481.34] who invites us
[5481.34 → 5482.72] to meet him

[5980.86 → 5993.82] that He should give His only Son to make a wretch His treasure.
[5995.50 → 6007.86] How great the pain of searing loss, the Father turns His face away,
[6007.86 → 6019.78] as wounds which mar the Chosen One, bring many sons to glory.
[6019.78 → 6041.78] Behold the man upon the cross, my sin upon His shoulders.
[6041.78 → 6055.68] Ashamed, I hear my walking voice call out amongst the soft birds.
[6055.68 → 6067.68] It was my sin that held Him bare, until it was accomplished.

[6080.34 → 6104.26] I will not boast in anything, no gifts, no power, no wisdom.
[6104.26 → 6117.18] But I will boast in Jesus Christ, His death and resurrection.
[6117.18 → 6124.18] Why should I gain from His reward?
[6124.18 → 6130.18] I cannot give an answer.
[6130.18 → 6143.02] But this I know with all my heart, His wounds have made my ransom.
[6143.02 → 6173.00] His wounds have made my ransom.
[6173.00 → 6177.00] I am wide, once high and flying at his groan, and keep my permission.

[6187.30 → 6217.28] Thank you.
[6217.30 → 6237.26] I know a place, a wonderful place, where accused and condemned by mercy and grace,
[6237.26 → 6251.26] where the wrongs we have done and the wrongs done to us were nailed there within,
[6251.26 → 6258.26] there at the cross.
[6258.26 → 6269.26] At the cross, we died for our sin.
[6270.06 → 6279.26] At the cross, you gave us life again.
[6279.26 → 6302.26] I know a place, a wonderful place, where accused and condemned by mercy and grace,
[6302.26 → 6317.26] where the wrongs we have done and the wrongs done to us were nailed there with you,
[6317.26 → 6323.26] there on the cross.

[6398.26 → 6399.26] Living Hope.
[6399.26 → 6414.26] How great the chasm that lay between us!
[6414.26 → 6430.26] How high the mountain I could not climb!
[6430.26 → 6444.26] In desperation, I turned to heaven, and spoke your name into the light.
[6444.26 → 6458.26] Then through the darkness, your loving kindness tore through the shadows of my soul.
[6458.26 → 6465.26] The world is finished, the end is written,
[6465.26 → 6473.26] Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[6473.26 → 6483.26] Who could imagine so great a mercy?
[6483.26 → 6486.26] What heart could imagine so great a mercy?
[6486.26 → 6490.26] What heart could fathom such proudest grace?
[6490.26 → 6497.26] The God of ages, stepped down from glory,
[6497.26 → 6504.26] To wear my sin and bear my shame.
[6504.26 → 6506.26] The death, the grace of God.
[6506.26 → 6507.26] The mother, I bring with me now!
[6507.26 → 6508.26] The Wraith.
[6508.26 → 6511.26] The wicked number Ice examination.
[6511.26 → 6517.26] The hand, this is what will see.
[6517.26 → 6525.26] Please say purpose boldly.
[6525.26 → 6530.26] Who could imagine so great and duration?
[6530.26 → 6532.26] Hallelujah
[6532.26 → 6539.64] Praise the one who set me free
[6539.64 → 6542.26] Hallelujah
[6542.26 → 6546.50] Death has lost its grip on me
[6546.50 → 6549.26] You are broken and reaching

[6553.28 → 6559.26] Jesus Christ, my living hope

[6610.60 → 6616.60] Declared grave has no claim on me
[6616.60 → 6623.60] Then came the morning that sealed the promise
[6623.60 → 6630.94] Your buried body began to breathe
[6630.94 → 6636.94] Out of the silence the roaring lion
[6636.94 → 6643.94] Jesus, the great God's no claim on me
[6643.94 → 6651.28] Jesus, the Lord, here is a great glory

[6751.72 → 6758.76] And then at the end of the blessing, he says, so they will put my name on their heads.
[6758.76 → 6764.96] This blessing is God writing his name on you.
