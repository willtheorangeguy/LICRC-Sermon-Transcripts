[0.00 --> 29.98]  I can sing of your love forever
[30.00 --> 37.00]  I can sing of your love forever
[37.00 --> 41.00]  I can sing of your love forever
[41.00 --> 47.00]  I can sing of your love forever
[47.00 --> 52.00]  I can sing of your love
[52.00 --> 57.00]  Oh I feel like dancing
[57.00 --> 62.00]  It's foolishness I know
[62.00 --> 65.00]  But when the world is in light
[65.00 --> 68.00]  They will dance with joy
[68.00 --> 72.00]  Like we're dancing now
[72.00 --> 77.00]  I can sing of your love forever
[77.00 --> 82.00]  I can sing of your love forever
[82.00 --> 87.00]  I can sing of your love forever
[87.00 --> 92.00]  I can sing of your love forever
[92.00 --> 97.00]  I will sing of your love forever
[97.00 --> 101.00]  I can sing of your love forever
[101.00 --> 104.00]  I can sing of your love forever
[104.00 --> 108.00]  I can sing of your love forever
[108.00 --> 111.00]  I can sing of your love forever
[111.00 --> 118.00]  I can sing of your love forever
[118.00 --> 121.00]  I can sing of your love forever
[121.00 --> 126.00]  I can sing of your love forever
[126.00 --> 133.00]  I can sing of your love forever
[133.00 --> 136.00]  I can sing of your love forever
[136.00 --> 139.00]  I can sing of your love forever
[139.00 --> 146.00]  I can sing of your love forever
[146.00 --> 150.00]  I can sing of your love forever
[150.00 --> 152.00]  I can sing of your love forever
[152.00 --> 159.00]  I can sing of your love forever
[159.00 --> 160.94]  forever
[189.00 --> 218.98]  Thank you.
[219.00 --> 248.98]  Thank you.
[249.00 --> 278.98]  Thank you.
[279.00 --> 281.00]  Thank you.
[309.00 --> 311.00]  Thank you.
[339.00 --> 341.00]  Thank you.
[369.00 --> 371.00]  Thank you.
[399.00 --> 401.00]  Thank you.
[429.00 --> 431.00]  Thank you.
[459.00 --> 461.00]  Thank you.
[489.00 --> 491.00]  Thank you.
[519.00 --> 521.00]  Thank you.
[521.00 --> 523.00]  Thank you.
[523.00 --> 525.00]  Thank you.
[525.00 --> 527.00]  Thank you.
[527.00 --> 528.00]  Good morning.
[528.00 --> 529.00]  How's everyone doing?
[529.00 --> 530.00]  Great.
[530.00 --> 531.00]  All right.
[531.00 --> 532.00]  All right.
[532.00 --> 533.00]  So the people behind me are doing good.
[533.00 --> 535.00]  Jerry's doing okay.
[535.00 --> 537.00]  How about the rest of y'all?
[537.00 --> 538.00]  Okay.
[538.00 --> 539.00]  The people behind me are doing okay.
[539.00 --> 540.00]  And Jerry's doing okay.
[540.00 --> 542.00]  How about the rest of y'all?
[542.00 --> 543.00]  There we go.
[543.00 --> 544.00]  Thank you.
[544.00 --> 545.00]  My goodness.
[545.00 --> 547.00]  Welcome to church.
[547.00 --> 548.00]  A special welcome.
[548.00 --> 554.00]  If you are visiting with us this morning, we are really excited to worship together this week.
[554.00 --> 557.00]  We're excited as we dig into a new teaching series.
[557.00 --> 562.00]  We're excited as today's the first Sunday that children's worship time is back up and running.
[562.00 --> 568.00]  And so kids are very excited and parents are even more excited for that.
[568.00 --> 579.00]  If you don't know what I'm talking about and you're visiting with us, that table back there, you can sign up your kids up to grade four to participate in our children's worship.
[579.00 --> 583.00]  They leave through the service and you can get them involved there.
[583.00 --> 593.00]  This week, the GEMS program begins on Thursday, which is a girls program for girls from grade three, three to seven.
[593.00 --> 594.00]  Thank you.
[594.00 --> 598.00]  And so you can get ready for that and sign up for that.
[598.00 --> 600.00]  If you have questions about that, Courtney is there.
[600.00 --> 601.00]  She'll gladly answer them.
[601.00 --> 605.00]  Or my daughter, Nora, will tell you everything about GEMS as well.
[605.00 --> 615.00]  Following our worship together this morning, we have a brief special meeting for the members of Emmanuel.
[615.00 --> 628.00]  And so if you are a member over 18, we're going to ask that you stay for a few minutes after our worship together so we can have a quick discussion about a proposal from council for the young adult ministry.
[628.00 --> 631.00]  Eric will give more explanation on that later.
[631.00 --> 634.00]  If you are visiting with us, you have two choices.
[634.00 --> 641.00]  You can stay here and hang out and hear about the awesome things that are happening in our midst in that ministry and program.
[641.00 --> 649.00]  Or you can grab a coffee and hang out at the back and then the rest of us will join you as quickly as we can there.
[649.00 --> 651.00]  I'm going to invite Perry to the front.
[651.00 --> 655.00]  He's going to make an announcement on behalf of Roots and Routes as well.
[655.00 --> 673.00]  Hello.
[673.00 --> 674.00]  Good morning.
[674.00 --> 677.00]  Okay, Roots and Routes.
[677.00 --> 683.00]  This is a thing that we've been having going for a few years before the pandemic.
[683.00 --> 684.00]  It's starting up.
[684.00 --> 689.00]  Roots and Routes is basically an adult education form and you get to grow in knowledge.
[689.00 --> 691.00]  You get to grow in discipleship.
[691.00 --> 694.00]  You get to grow in your relationship with God.
[694.00 --> 697.00]  We tend to follow a particular book.
[697.00 --> 701.00]  The book this time is Secular Creed.
[701.00 --> 706.00]  We had about 30 copies of the book and they've been all given out.
[706.00 --> 709.00]  Hopefully those who still owe $5 will pay that yet.
[709.00 --> 712.00]  And we look forward to having you all there.
[712.00 --> 716.00]  What else can I say about Roots and Routes?
[716.00 --> 721.00]  Oh, it's October 26th on a Wednesday at 7.15 in the evening.
[721.00 --> 723.00]  So we have a date pegged for that.
[723.00 --> 727.00]  And Pastor Chris will be leading the session.
[727.00 --> 729.00]  There's usually a presenter related to the book.
[729.00 --> 732.00]  So Pastor Chris will be presenting on the book.
[732.00 --> 736.00]  And we look to see as many people out as possible on that evening.
[736.00 --> 738.00]  Thank you very much.
[738.00 --> 741.00]  Thank you, Perry.
[741.00 --> 745.00]  Just two more quick announcements.
[745.00 --> 750.00]  First, next week in our worship together, we will be celebrating Lord's Supper.
[750.00 --> 756.00]  And so we encourage you over this next week to reflect on your relationship to God.
[756.00 --> 764.00]  And as you have the opportunity and ability in your homes with your kids to reflect on what it means to come to the table together.
[764.00 --> 769.00]  So we can do that next week as a body and family together.
[769.00 --> 773.00]  And then also next weekend is Thanksgiving weekend.
[773.00 --> 788.00]  And so that means for us on Thanksgiving Monday, there is a worship service here at 10 o'clock, which you and your families are all invited to join and participate in as we gather to give thanks to our God for all that he has done for us.
[788.00 --> 791.00]  I think that's it.
[791.00 --> 792.00]  I think that's it.
[792.00 --> 794.00]  I think that's it.
[794.00 --> 795.00]  Safe Church.
[795.00 --> 797.00]  I knew there was one more.
[797.00 --> 801.00]  Tomorrow, October 3rd in the evening is a Safe Church training meeting.
[801.00 --> 814.00]  And this is for all of us who volunteer and who serve in this church community, primarily for those of us who deal with youth and vulnerable sector populations.
[814.00 --> 815.00]  But it is open to all.
[815.00 --> 820.00]  And you are, I want to say strongly encouraged, but actually it's more than that.
[820.00 --> 825.00]  You are required to attend this event if you volunteer in that capacity.
[825.00 --> 829.00]  And so we had one previously and there were some 30, 40 people there, which was a great turnout.
[829.00 --> 834.00]  We need probably three times that amount to get all the volunteers who serve in different capacities.
[834.00 --> 840.00]  So please come tomorrow night for that training event here at the church.
[840.00 --> 842.00]  At 7?
[842.00 --> 843.00]  7.
[843.00 --> 844.00]  Very good.
[844.00 --> 845.00]  Thank you.
[845.00 --> 849.00]  Sylvia and you both are nodding, so I'm just going to go with that.
[849.00 --> 851.00]  7 o'clock, be here.
[851.00 --> 855.00]  Now I think that's it, unless someone else wants to raise their hand.
[855.00 --> 856.00]  All right.
[856.00 --> 858.00]  Let's stand together.
[858.00 --> 865.00]  Father, we can be greeted by God in our worship this morning.
[867.00 --> 871.00]  We come into God's presence and he welcomes us here.
[872.00 --> 876.00]  Grace, mercy, and peace to you.
[876.00 --> 881.00]  From God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[882.00 --> 883.00]  Amen.
[883.00 --> 889.00]  As God has welcomed us into his presence, I'm going to invite you to turn to those around you and welcome them into worship.
[889.00 --> 892.00]  Be mindful of how someone might be comfortable with that.
[892.00 --> 895.00]  So fist bump or hug or holy kiss, but don't cross lines.
[895.00 --> 896.00]  Amen.
[913.00 --> 926.00]  Our call to worship this morning comes from Psalm 97, verses 9 to 12.
[926.00 --> 931.00]  For you, Lord, are the most high over all the earth.
[931.00 --> 935.00]  You are exalted far above all gods.
[935.00 --> 944.00]  Let those who love the Lord hate evil, for he guards the lives of his faithful ones and delivers them from the hand of the wicked.
[944.00 --> 949.00]  Light shines on the righteous and joy on the upright in heart.
[949.00 --> 954.00]  Rejoice in the Lord, you who are righteous, and praise his holy name.
[954.00 --> 957.00]  Let those who love the Lord, you who are righteous, and praise his holy name.
[957.00 --> 960.00]  Let those who love the Lord, you who are righteous, and praise his holy name.
[960.00 --> 962.00]  Let that make out of the wicked and holy name.
[962.00 --> 990.00]  From the ends of the earth, from the depths of the sea, from the heights of the heavens, your name be praised.
[990.00 --> 1009.00]  From the hearts of the weak, from the shouts of the strong, from the lips of all people, this song we praise, Lord.
[1009.00 --> 1018.00]  Throughout the endless ages, you will be crowned with praises, Lord.
[1018.00 --> 1032.04]  Most high, exalted in every nation, sovereign of all creation, Lord.
[1032.04 --> 1041.04]  Most high, be magnified, be magnified.
[1041.04 --> 1060.04]  From the ends of the earth, from the depths of the sea, from the heights of the heavens, your name be praised.
[1060.04 --> 1080.04]  From the hearts of the weak, from the shouts of the strong, from the lips of all people, this song we praise, Lord.
[1080.04 --> 1089.04]  Throughout the endless ages, you will be crowned with praises, Lord.
[1089.04 --> 1102.98]  Most high, exalted in every nation, sovereign of all creation, Lord.
[1102.98 --> 1104.98]  Most high, be magnified.
[1104.98 --> 1116.30]  Most high, throughout the endless ages, you will be crowned with praises, Lord.
[1116.30 --> 1118.30]  Most high, be magnified.
[1118.30 --> 1120.30]  Most high, be magnified.
[1120.30 --> 1121.30]  Most high, be magnified.
[1121.30 --> 1129.30]  Exalted in every nation, sovereign of all creation, Lord.
[1129.30 --> 1136.30]  Most high, be magnified.
[1136.30 --> 1138.30]  Be magnified.
[1138.30 --> 1140.30]  Be magnified.
[1140.30 --> 1142.30]  Be magnified.
[1142.30 --> 1170.40]  Only my care, from the hearts of thy sins.
[1170.40 --> 1182.98]  Come, Thou fount of every blessing, tune my heart to sing Thy grace.
[1182.98 --> 1194.82]  Streams of mercy never ceasing, call for songs of loudest praise.
[1194.82 --> 1206.06]  Teach me song, melodious sonnet, sung by flaming tongues above.
[1206.62 --> 1217.02]  Praise the mount, I'm fixed upon it, mount of Thy redeeming love.
[1224.82 --> 1236.68]  Here I raise my Ebenezer, hither by Thy help I've come.
[1237.12 --> 1247.68]  And I hope by Thy good pleasure, safely to arrive at home.
[1247.68 --> 1259.40]  Jesus sought me when a stranger, wandering from the fold of God.
[1259.90 --> 1270.06]  He to rescue me from danger, interposed His precious blood.
[1277.68 --> 1300.44]  O to grace how great a debtor, daily I'm constrained to be.
[1300.44 --> 1312.64]  Let Thy goodness, like a fetter, find my wandering heart to Thee.
[1313.10 --> 1318.42]  Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it.
[1318.88 --> 1323.98]  Prone to live, the God I love.
[1323.98 --> 1329.92]  Here's my heart, Lord, take and seal it.
[1330.38 --> 1334.98]  Seal it for Thy courts above.
[1335.98 --> 1344.68]  All else, I adore Your name.
[1344.68 --> 1356.18]  Above all else, tune my heart to sing Your praise.
[1356.18 --> 1367.10]  Above all else, I adore Your name.
[1367.10 --> 1378.38]  Above all else, tune my heart to sing Your praise.
[1378.38 --> 1388.82]  Above all else, I adore Your name.
[1388.82 --> 1400.82]  Above all else, tune my heart to sing Your praise.
[1400.82 --> 1409.82]  Above all else, I adore Your name.
[1409.82 --> 1410.82]  Above all else, I adore Your name.
[1410.82 --> 1419.82]  Above all else, tune my heart to sing Your praise.
[1419.82 --> 1424.82]  The highest praise, the loudest praise.
[1424.82 --> 1431.82]  To the name above every name.
[1431.82 --> 1449.82]  Our confession and assurance comes from the Heidelberg Catechism,
[1449.92 --> 1452.04]  question and answer number 60.
[1452.16 --> 1455.08]  I'll read the question if you can read the answer with me.
[1455.08 --> 1460.08]  How are you righteous before God?
[1460.08 --> 1464.08]  Only by true faith in Jesus Christ.
[1464.08 --> 1473.08]  Even though my conscience accuses me of having grievously sinned against all God's commandments,
[1473.08 --> 1481.08]  of never having kept any of them, and of still being inclined toward all evil,
[1481.08 --> 1493.08]  nevertheless, without any merit of my own, out of sheer grace, God grants and credits to me the perfect satisfaction,
[1493.08 --> 1501.08]  righteousness, and holiness of Christ, as if I had never sinned nor been a sinner,
[1501.08 --> 1511.08]  as if I had been as perfectly obedient as Christ was obedient for me.
[1511.08 --> 1516.08]  All I need to do is accept this gift with a believing heart.
[1516.08 --> 1528.08]  Now, the many money 주세요 have accumulated per your livestock
[1528.08 --> 1531.08]  and knit inside the сердiento.
[1531.08 --> 1535.08]  Ammonen and touch the lineage of the enemy,
[1535.08 --> 1538.08]  so continue it through yourself.
[1538.08 --> 1553.52]  O Lord, my rock and my redeemer,
[1554.98 --> 1560.74]  greatest treasure of my longing soul.
[1560.74 --> 1568.86]  My God, like you there is no other,
[1568.86 --> 1576.62]  true delight is found in you alone.
[1577.70 --> 1584.20]  Your grace, oh well too deep to fathom,
[1584.20 --> 1592.78]  your love exceeds the heavens reach,
[1593.02 --> 1598.74]  your truth a fount of perfect wisdom,
[1600.02 --> 1607.20]  my highest good and my unending need.
[1607.20 --> 1618.10]  O Lord, my rock and my redeemer,
[1619.24 --> 1627.02]  strong defender of my weary heart,
[1627.02 --> 1633.40]  my sword to fight the cruel deceiver,
[1634.98 --> 1642.02]  and my shield against his hateful darts,
[1643.02 --> 1649.02]  my song when enemies surround me,
[1649.02 --> 1657.88]  my hope when tides of sorrow rise,
[1657.88 --> 1663.78]  my joy when trials are abounding,
[1664.70 --> 1673.26]  your faithfulness my refuge in the night.
[1673.26 --> 1683.62]  O Lord, my rock and my redeemer,
[1685.18 --> 1692.54]  gracious Savior of my ruined life,
[1692.54 --> 1698.68]  my guilt and cross laid on your shoulders,
[1698.68 --> 1707.82]  in my place you suffered, bled and died.
[1707.82 --> 1714.18]  You rose, the grave and death are conquered.
[1716.06 --> 1722.44]  You broke my bonds of sin and shame.
[1722.44 --> 1744.14]  O Lord, my rock and my redeemer,
[1744.14 --> 1753.40]  may all my days bring glory to your name.
[1774.14 --> 1804.12]  You broke my bonds of sin and shame.
[1804.14 --> 1807.84]  Grand earth has quaked before,
[1810.76 --> 1815.70]  moved by the sound of his voice.
[1817.16 --> 1821.66]  Seas that are shaken and stirred
[1821.66 --> 1827.84]  can be calmed and broken for my regard.
[1827.84 --> 1832.84]  through it all, through it all,
[1832.84 --> 1836.84]  through it all, my eyes are on you.
[1836.84 --> 1842.84]  Through it all, through it all, it is well.
[1844.84 --> 1848.84]  Through it all, through it all,
[1848.84 --> 1851.84]  through it all, my eyes are on you.
[1851.84 --> 1857.84]  And it is well with me.
[1857.84 --> 1873.84]  Far be it from me to not believe,
[1873.84 --> 1878.84]  even when my eyes can't see.
[1878.84 --> 1880.84]  Even when my eyes can't see.
[1880.84 --> 1886.84]  And this mountain that's in front of me,
[1886.84 --> 1893.84]  will be thrown into the sea.
[1893.84 --> 1895.84]  Through it all, through it all,
[1895.84 --> 1901.84]  through it all, my eyes are on you.
[1901.84 --> 1908.84]  Through it all, through it all, it is well.
[1908.84 --> 1916.84]  Through it all, through it all, my eyes are on you.
[1916.84 --> 1919.84]  And it is well.
[1919.84 --> 1923.84]  It is well.
[1923.84 --> 1931.84]  So let go, my soul, and trust in him.
[1931.84 --> 1938.84]  The waves and winds still know his name.
[1938.84 --> 1945.84]  So let go, my soul, and trust in him.
[1945.84 --> 1952.84]  The waves and winds still know his name.
[1952.84 --> 1977.84]  The waves and waves still know his name.
[1977.84 --> 1992.84]  It is well with my soul.
[1992.84 --> 2007.84]  It is well with my soul.
[2007.84 --> 2022.84]  It is well with my soul.
[2022.84 --> 2023.84]  It is well with my soul.
[2023.84 --> 2024.84]  It is well with my soul.
[2024.84 --> 2029.84]  It is well with my soul.
[2029.84 --> 2036.84]  It is well with my soul.
[2036.84 --> 2038.84]  It is well with my soul.
[2038.84 --> 2040.84]  It is well with my soul.
[2040.84 --> 2041.84]  It is well with my soul.
[2041.84 --> 2047.84]  It is well with my soul.
[2047.84 --> 2048.84]  It is well with my soul.
[2048.84 --> 2049.84]  It is well with my soul.
[2049.84 --> 2050.84]  It is well with my soul.
[2050.84 --> 2051.84]  It is well with my soul.
[2051.84 --> 2052.84]  It is well with my soul.
[2052.84 --> 2053.84]  It is well with my soul.
[2053.84 --> 2054.84]  It is well with my soul.
[2054.84 --> 2055.84]  It is well with my soul.
[2055.84 --> 2056.84]  It is well with my soul.
[2056.84 --> 2057.84]  It is well with my soul.
[2057.84 --> 2062.84]  It is well with my soul.
[2063.84 --> 2065.84]  It is well with my soul.
[2065.84 --> 2069.84]  It is well, it is well with my soul.
[2069.84 --> 2077.00]  With my soul
[2077.00 --> 2083.06]  It is well
[2083.06 --> 2086.86]  It is well
[2086.86 --> 2090.42]  With my soul
[2090.42 --> 2097.10]  It is well
[2097.10 --> 2100.94]  It is well
[2100.94 --> 2104.34]  With my soul
[2104.34 --> 2110.98]  It is well
[2110.98 --> 2114.90]  It is well
[2114.90 --> 2118.10]  With my soul
[2127.10 --> 2131.06]  Through it all
[2131.06 --> 2132.72]  Through it all
[2132.72 --> 2135.74]  My eyes are on you
[2135.74 --> 2138.72]  Through it all
[2138.72 --> 2139.88]  Through it all
[2139.88 --> 2142.14]  It is well
[2142.14 --> 2146.26]  Through it all
[2146.26 --> 2147.86]  Through it all
[2147.86 --> 2150.92]  My eyes are on you
[2150.92 --> 2153.70]  And it is well
[2153.70 --> 2156.98]  With me
[2156.98 --> 2169.14]  You may have a seat
[2177.86 --> 2190.90]  Good morning
[2190.90 --> 2194.74]  My name is Clem
[2194.74 --> 2196.32]  And I am one of the deacons here
[2196.32 --> 2198.54]  And it is time for
[2198.54 --> 2199.90]  The giving of our gifts
[2199.90 --> 2203.68]  Today's offerings are for
[2203.68 --> 2205.62]  Langley Emanuel's ministries
[2205.62 --> 2206.52]  And missions
[2206.52 --> 2208.58]  The special offering
[2208.58 --> 2211.02]  Is for the benevolence fund
[2211.02 --> 2213.60]  This ministry's focus
[2213.60 --> 2214.84]  Is to help meet
[2214.84 --> 2216.16]  The physical needs
[2216.16 --> 2217.48]  Of the members
[2217.48 --> 2218.26]  Of our church
[2218.26 --> 2219.66]  Sometimes
[2219.66 --> 2221.58]  The need is financial
[2221.58 --> 2222.88]  And sometimes
[2222.88 --> 2224.68]  The need is a helping hand
[2224.68 --> 2227.12]  Maybe many helping hands
[2227.12 --> 2229.34]  This fund is also
[2229.34 --> 2230.84]  For assisting with the needs
[2230.84 --> 2231.60]  In our community
[2231.60 --> 2234.98]  The definition of benevolence
[2234.98 --> 2235.78]  Includes
[2235.78 --> 2238.08]  A disposition to do good
[2238.08 --> 2240.28]  An act of kindness
[2240.28 --> 2242.40]  A generous gift
[2242.40 --> 2244.96]  All marks
[2244.96 --> 2246.68]  That are a testament
[2246.68 --> 2247.78]  To God's grace
[2247.78 --> 2249.28]  At work in the church
[2249.28 --> 2252.08]  Galatians 6.10
[2252.08 --> 2254.72]  Therefore, as we have opportunity
[2254.72 --> 2256.42]  Let us do good
[2256.42 --> 2257.36]  To all people
[2257.36 --> 2259.16]  Especially to those
[2259.16 --> 2259.98]  Who belong
[2259.98 --> 2261.76]  To the family of believers
[2261.76 --> 2264.62]  Next week's special offering
[2264.62 --> 2266.30]  Is for the Langley Food Bank
[2266.30 --> 2296.30]  C orbitals
[2296.30 --> 2311.96]  Jacob, whose love endures through generations. I know that you will keep your covenant.
[2311.96 --> 2334.64]  I'm calling on the God of Moses, the one who opened up the ocean. I need you now to do the same thing for me.
[2334.64 --> 2353.44]  O God, my God, I need you. O God, my God, I need you now. How I need you now.
[2354.84 --> 2363.44]  O rock, O rock of ages, I'm standing on your faithfulness.
[2364.64 --> 2369.12]  On your faithfulness.
[2369.54 --> 2380.96]  I'm calling on the God of Mary, whose favor rests upon the lowly.
[2380.96 --> 2401.28]  I know with you all things are possible. I'm calling on the God of David, who made a shepherd boy courageous.
[2401.28 --> 2418.74]  I may not face Goliath, but I've got my own giants. O God, my God, I need you. O God, my God, I need you now.
[2418.74 --> 2422.70]  How I need you now.
[2424.70 --> 2432.74]  O rock, O rock of ages, I'm standing on your faithfulness.
[2432.74 --> 2438.22]  On your faithfulness.
[2438.22 --> 2452.22]  O rock, O rock of ages, I'm standing on your faithfulness.
[2452.22 --> 2458.96]  You heard your children then. You hear your children now.
[2458.96 --> 2461.96]  You are the same God.
[2461.96 --> 2465.96]  You are the same God.
[2465.96 --> 2468.96]  You answered prayers back then.
[2468.96 --> 2472.96]  And you will answer now.
[2472.96 --> 2475.96]  You are the same God.
[2475.96 --> 2478.96]  You are the same God.
[2478.96 --> 2479.96]  You were the same God.
[2479.96 --> 2482.96]  You were providing them.
[2482.96 --> 2483.96]  You are providing them.
[2483.96 --> 2485.96]  You are providing them.
[2485.96 --> 2488.96]  You are the same God.
[2488.96 --> 2493.96]  You are the same God.
[2493.96 --> 2496.96]  You moved in power then.
[2496.96 --> 2499.96]  God move in power now.
[2499.96 --> 2503.96]  You are the same God.
[2503.96 --> 2506.96]  You are the same God.
[2506.96 --> 2509.96]  You were a healer then.
[2509.96 --> 2513.96]  You are a healer now.
[2513.96 --> 2516.96]  You are the same God.
[2516.96 --> 2519.96]  You are the same God.
[2519.96 --> 2522.96]  You were a savior then.
[2522.96 --> 2526.96]  You are a savior now.
[2526.96 --> 2529.96]  You are the same God.
[2529.96 --> 2532.96]  You are the same God.
[2532.96 --> 2536.96]  Oh God, my God, I need you.
[2536.96 --> 2540.96]  Oh God, my God, I need you now.
[2540.96 --> 2544.96]  How I need you now.
[2544.96 --> 2559.96]  How I need you now.
[2559.96 --> 2560.96]  Oh.
[2560.96 --> 2563.96]  Oh, My God, I need you.
[2563.96 --> 2567.96]  Oh, God, my God, I need you now.
[2567.96 --> 2572.96]  How I need you now.
[2572.96 --> 2588.96]  O rock, O rock of ages, I'm standing on your faithfulness, on your faithfulness.
[2602.96 --> 2617.02]  Good morning.
[2617.02 --> 2622.90]  Can I have all the three-year-olds to grade four up here today?
[2623.74 --> 2626.38]  We are back to regular children's worship time.
[2626.44 --> 2627.58]  No more summer break.
[2630.06 --> 2631.88]  I'm going to a new classroom.
[2631.88 --> 2632.74]  Oh, I know.
[2632.82 --> 2634.92]  Some of you guys are going to be in new grades.
[2635.00 --> 2636.80]  You might have a different teacher.
[2636.98 --> 2638.90]  There might be different kids in your class.
[2639.60 --> 2641.96]  Yeah, I think a lot of you are going to be in the same people.
[2643.20 --> 2644.20]  Did you guys have a good summer?
[2644.28 --> 2646.28]  Some of you I haven't seen in a long time.
[2646.66 --> 2648.26]  And I have a big question for you.
[2648.68 --> 2650.22]  Oh, there's two questions, actually.
[2651.32 --> 2658.86]  Over the summer, what is the smallest thing you saw all summer?
[2659.72 --> 2660.46]  Think real hard.
[2660.46 --> 2662.28]  What are the smallest things?
[2664.36 --> 2665.36]  A fly.
[2665.74 --> 2666.20]  What else?
[2666.28 --> 2668.02]  What are the small things did you see?
[2668.24 --> 2669.00]  What about you, Marcus?
[2671.82 --> 2673.14]  A ladybug.
[2673.96 --> 2674.56]  What did you see?
[2675.92 --> 2676.64]  Fruit fly.
[2676.72 --> 2677.50]  Yeah, those are small.
[2677.72 --> 2679.20]  And everywhere right now.
[2679.88 --> 2680.68]  What did you see?
[2680.68 --> 2689.52]  Oh, on the way.
[2689.62 --> 2690.42]  Okay, cool.
[2691.16 --> 2691.82]  What did you see, Hayley?
[2692.06 --> 2693.74]  I saw baby birds.
[2694.10 --> 2695.06]  Baby birds.
[2695.34 --> 2696.70]  Those are really little things.
[2696.80 --> 2697.08]  Hey.
[2698.14 --> 2698.54]  I think.
[2698.64 --> 2699.42]  I saw the baby bird.
[2699.60 --> 2700.24]  Oh, whoa.
[2701.00 --> 2701.88]  What about this?
[2701.92 --> 2703.40]  What about, let's go the other direction.
[2703.54 --> 2705.86]  What's the biggest thing you saw all summer?
[2706.82 --> 2707.80]  What do you think, Malcolm?
[2707.80 --> 2710.70]  The science world dome.
[2710.96 --> 2711.78]  That's pretty big.
[2715.78 --> 2717.04]  The whole moon?
[2717.50 --> 2719.20]  Yeah, that is big.
[2719.46 --> 2720.36]  That is a big thing.
[2722.46 --> 2723.50]  The sun.
[2723.62 --> 2724.18]  Good one.
[2724.26 --> 2725.50]  The sun is humongous.
[2725.80 --> 2727.06]  What did you see that's really big?
[2727.06 --> 2731.10]  What's that?
[2733.66 --> 2734.32]  The sun?
[2734.62 --> 2734.82]  Yeah.
[2735.00 --> 2736.00]  You also saw the sun?
[2736.62 --> 2738.38]  The sky is pretty big.
[2741.92 --> 2742.58]  Oh, boy.
[2742.70 --> 2743.28]  That's big.
[2743.60 --> 2744.66]  That's pretty big, too.
[2745.66 --> 2746.04]  Yeah.
[2746.24 --> 2749.58]  So, we saw all kinds of little things and all kinds of big things.
[2749.58 --> 2755.76]  And I'm asking about that because today we're starting fresh at children's worship time.
[2755.98 --> 2758.90]  And we're starting with what story you think we're going to start with.
[2758.96 --> 2760.82]  If we're starting fresh, starting new.
[2761.88 --> 2763.92]  What's a first story in the Bible?
[2765.90 --> 2766.64]  What's that?
[2767.50 --> 2768.38]  Chapter 1.
[2768.46 --> 2770.46]  What's chapter 1 in Genesis all about?
[2772.90 --> 2773.42]  Yes.
[2773.60 --> 2774.98]  God created the world.
[2775.22 --> 2777.86]  We're going to talk about creation today at children's worship time.
[2777.86 --> 2778.46]  Cool, hey?
[2778.46 --> 2779.70]  Okay.
[2780.30 --> 2782.66]  Well, why don't we stand?
[2782.76 --> 2783.48]  We'll do the blessing.
[2784.34 --> 2789.86]  And then we'll go dive into the awesome story of creation from little things to really big things.
[2790.00 --> 2790.26]  All right.
[2790.32 --> 2791.36]  Let's put our arms up.
[2792.02 --> 2792.22]  Ready?
[2793.22 --> 2795.10]  The Lord be with you.
[2795.64 --> 2797.28]  All right.
[2797.34 --> 2798.66]  Let's go to children's worship time.
[2808.46 --> 2827.28]  Good morning.
[2827.52 --> 2828.70]  My name is Dave.
[2829.06 --> 2831.72]  I'm one of the elders on our church council.
[2831.72 --> 2836.58]  And it is my privilege to lead us in our church family prayer.
[2837.00 --> 2837.78]  Shall we pray?
[2841.28 --> 2843.58]  Father, it is very good for us to be here.
[2843.82 --> 2849.84]  We thank you for this Sunday, for this Lord's Day, for us to come together and to meet with Christians everywhere.
[2849.84 --> 2853.58]  And to celebrate your goodness in our lives.
[2854.04 --> 2858.98]  It is something that we get to enjoy with the church everywhere and the church universal.
[2858.98 --> 2862.92]  We praise you and we celebrate your goodness in our lives.
[2864.28 --> 2870.84]  Father, on this Sunday, it is important that we come to you in our time of confession.
[2870.84 --> 2874.62]  We think about the things that we have done.
[2875.02 --> 2877.68]  We think about things we have done and things that we have not done.
[2878.04 --> 2881.56]  We think about things that we have said and things that we have not said.
[2881.78 --> 2888.82]  We pray for your forgiveness and that we may witness in an effective way for the people around us.
[2889.40 --> 2893.94]  On this long weekend, we think about the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation,
[2894.28 --> 2900.34]  where we think about the legacy of the harms that we have done as a country.
[2900.84 --> 2906.26]  And with the knowledge and the participation of different churches,
[2906.86 --> 2912.46]  we pray that this day would be a good opportunity to understand the truth and to build reconciliation.
[2913.32 --> 2917.42]  And as Paul wrote to the Ephesians, and it applies here,
[2918.06 --> 2921.44]  that Christ himself is our peace, who has made the two groups one,
[2921.94 --> 2924.54]  has destroyed the dividing wall of hostility.
[2925.28 --> 2929.76]  And to reconcile both of them to God, by which he has put to death their hostility.
[2929.76 --> 2933.46]  We thank you for those encouraging words that we may take them to heart.
[2935.44 --> 2939.50]  Father, this is also an opportunity for us to thank you for all the good things in our lives.
[2939.72 --> 2942.08]  We think about the nice weather that we can enjoy today.
[2942.54 --> 2947.68]  It's an opportunity for us to marvel about your creation and know that it is very good.
[2948.28 --> 2950.84]  We thank you for this church community that we are part of.
[2950.84 --> 2954.54]  We thank you for the leadership provided by Pastor Chris, by Pastor Kevin,
[2955.08 --> 2958.44]  and by all those who have a leadership role here.
[2958.84 --> 2965.34]  We think about the many ministries and the many volunteers that our church has.
[2966.20 --> 2968.90]  We pray that as they begin a new season,
[2969.30 --> 2972.90]  that all of these new ministries will be meaningful and successful.
[2972.90 --> 2977.92]  We think about coffee break, children's worship time, cadets, gems, youth,
[2978.34 --> 2980.22]  the seniors ministry, the men's group.
[2980.52 --> 2985.94]  We pray that all of them may be a good way to bring us closer to you and to celebrate your name.
[2986.64 --> 2990.74]  We think about the sacrament of the Lord's Supper that we'll be celebrating next week.
[2991.28 --> 2994.82]  We thank you for that important symbol of Christ's life for us
[2994.82 --> 2997.44]  and the sacrifice that he made for us on the cross
[2997.44 --> 3003.00]  and that this memorial feast may be a good opportunity for us to remember and believe.
[3004.02 --> 3007.68]  Father, we think about the needs that we have here and in this church
[3007.68 --> 3010.26]  and in our community and the world around us.
[3010.64 --> 3013.44]  We think about the congregational meeting that will be happening today
[3013.44 --> 3017.42]  as we consider an important proposal from Council
[3017.42 --> 3019.88]  about what to do for our young adults ministry.
[3019.88 --> 3022.18]  We pray for your wisdom, your insight,
[3022.18 --> 3028.08]  that we may make a choice about how to proceed with this important task.
[3028.98 --> 3032.68]  We think about those who've been affected by serious weather events.
[3032.96 --> 3035.32]  We think about Hurricane Fiona on the East Coast.
[3035.74 --> 3041.44]  We think about Hurricane Ian in Florida and the Carolinas.
[3042.06 --> 3044.06]  There'll be a lot of work for immediate cleanup,
[3044.70 --> 3048.68]  but we also know there'll be a great deal of work for a long-term rebuild.
[3048.68 --> 3054.22]  We pray for local, national, and international efforts
[3054.22 --> 3057.74]  that taking care of those who have been affected by it,
[3057.86 --> 3061.64]  those who have been injured, those who have to deal with loss of life,
[3062.10 --> 3065.10]  that they will be able to come together for all of that.
[3065.64 --> 3069.42]  We think about world events, and we continue to pray for the war in Ukraine
[3069.42 --> 3076.76]  with a contentious referendum to legitimize this invasion and this takeover.
[3077.52 --> 3081.00]  We pray for all Ukrainians who have been affected by this war,
[3081.54 --> 3084.02]  those who have been displaced, those who have been injured.
[3084.20 --> 3086.18]  We think about the large loss of life.
[3086.80 --> 3088.20]  We pray for the Russians, too.
[3089.58 --> 3093.88]  It seems to us that the war is unpopular in many circles of that country,
[3093.88 --> 3098.16]  with people upset about the possibility of conscription
[3098.16 --> 3100.50]  and some actually leaving the country.
[3101.02 --> 3106.20]  We pray that they will be able to make good choices about their future, too.
[3107.08 --> 3109.14]  Father, we pray about those in our midst
[3109.14 --> 3113.24]  and those in our family and friend connections,
[3113.70 --> 3117.28]  those who struggle with health or any other aspect of their lives.
[3117.44 --> 3119.78]  We pray for your strength and your peace.
[3119.78 --> 3124.36]  And, Father, we pray for Pastor Chris as he leads us in the study of your word today
[3124.36 --> 3129.08]  with the study of the Psalms and looking at Psalm 130.
[3129.84 --> 3134.60]  We know that the Psalms are opportunities for praise and for lament.
[3135.22 --> 3140.04]  And for this one, we think about the psalmist's important words.
[3140.46 --> 3142.60]  Out of the depths we cry to you, O Lord.
[3143.00 --> 3144.20]  Lord, hear our voice.
[3145.24 --> 3147.18]  Father, we pray all these things,
[3147.18 --> 3149.44]  not because we deserve it,
[3149.58 --> 3150.88]  but we pray it in Jesus' name.
[3151.74 --> 3152.00]  Amen.
[3177.18 --> 3184.72]  As Dave said, we are going to read from Psalm 130,
[3185.66 --> 3187.16]  the first four verses of that,
[3187.22 --> 3189.92]  and I'll get to that in just a moment.
[3190.08 --> 3192.74]  But by way of introduction,
[3193.88 --> 3197.56]  yesterday, a couple of us from church here
[3197.56 --> 3202.70]  had the opportunity to go to Sunridge Retirement Living Community
[3202.70 --> 3205.80]  and to worship with the members there.
[3206.40 --> 3211.94]  And so Paul and Leslie and Sarah led us in worship in that community.
[3213.18 --> 3219.72]  I had the chance to go and sit in the middle of a group of young women.
[3220.66 --> 3221.58]  There you go, Jerry.
[3222.16 --> 3224.28]  And worship with them.
[3224.48 --> 3227.32]  And at one point, one of the ladies turned to me
[3227.32 --> 3228.18]  and she said, you know,
[3228.24 --> 3230.36]  I don't know any of these songs,
[3230.44 --> 3231.86]  but they're so beautiful.
[3233.14 --> 3234.64]  And then later, one of them,
[3234.76 --> 3236.16]  as I was chatting afterwards,
[3236.78 --> 3237.34]  said, you know,
[3237.40 --> 3239.96]  it's been three years since we've had people come
[3239.96 --> 3242.40]  and lead us in these things,
[3242.40 --> 3244.64]  and it just feels good in my heart
[3244.64 --> 3246.56]  to sing these songs again.
[3246.56 --> 3250.68]  And I share that with you both as a testament
[3250.68 --> 3253.82]  to the kinds of things that God is doing in our midst here
[3253.82 --> 3255.48]  and the opportunities we have to serve,
[3255.76 --> 3258.16]  but also to pick up on that idea
[3258.16 --> 3261.82]  that there's just something beautiful,
[3262.66 --> 3265.18]  something that speaks to our hearts
[3265.18 --> 3268.74]  about songs of worship,
[3268.86 --> 3270.34]  whether they are old or new,
[3270.80 --> 3274.52]  whether we have heard them before or not,
[3274.52 --> 3279.16]  there's just something that roots in our souls
[3279.16 --> 3282.10]  as we hear the voice of God through them.
[3284.04 --> 3286.66]  Psalms do the same.
[3287.32 --> 3288.22]  And for some of you,
[3288.28 --> 3289.82]  actually some of you are of a generation
[3289.82 --> 3293.44]  where you were forced to memorize these Psalms.
[3294.18 --> 3296.10]  If you're an immigrant from Holland,
[3296.22 --> 3297.68]  maybe even in the Dutch,
[3297.80 --> 3299.86]  but probably in the King James Version,
[3300.40 --> 3303.16]  and at the time you hated it.
[3303.16 --> 3308.28]  But now you call those to mind with an ease
[3308.28 --> 3310.36]  that just makes it beautiful.
[3311.72 --> 3313.60]  And perhaps there's something lost
[3313.60 --> 3317.82]  as we no longer require people to memorize Psalms
[3317.82 --> 3319.98]  in the same ways anymore.
[3320.20 --> 3320.98]  Point is,
[3321.92 --> 3327.54]  as we worship with and learn about
[3327.54 --> 3331.50]  and experience the depths of these Psalms together,
[3331.50 --> 3333.94]  we're going to dig deep.
[3334.70 --> 3336.08]  And I trust and pray
[3336.08 --> 3338.96]  that there's aspects of this time together
[3338.96 --> 3341.46]  that will make your heart sing,
[3342.10 --> 3344.38]  whether in joy or lament
[3344.38 --> 3346.50]  or in sorrow and grief,
[3346.66 --> 3349.92]  but that your heart will sing through that.
[3349.92 --> 3353.82]  Now, this series is going to be a little bit different
[3353.82 --> 3356.92]  than our normal here.
[3357.06 --> 3358.52]  In this series,
[3358.52 --> 3361.00]  we are going to be using the book of Psalms
[3361.00 --> 3364.66]  to help us understand our emotions and feelings.
[3364.84 --> 3369.04]  And so, unlike the wisdom presented here earlier,
[3369.04 --> 3370.64]  we're not going to start at chapter one.
[3371.42 --> 3372.62]  We're going to jump around
[3372.62 --> 3375.86]  and go thematically through these things.
[3376.02 --> 3376.60]  Each week,
[3377.34 --> 3378.94]  we are going to look at a different
[3378.94 --> 3382.90]  emotional experience or feeling,
[3383.06 --> 3385.04]  and we're going to sort of hold them up
[3385.04 --> 3386.98]  to the light of God's Word
[3386.98 --> 3388.64]  and His wisdom and counsel,
[3389.28 --> 3390.90]  and then hopefully, in that,
[3391.00 --> 3393.36]  being equipped to handle whatever it is.
[3394.04 --> 3395.22]  But also, right,
[3395.26 --> 3396.88]  that we might learn to master
[3396.88 --> 3398.70]  our hearts and minds
[3398.70 --> 3401.26]  and not be mastered by them.
[3401.26 --> 3405.16]  And so, like a jeweler with a diamond,
[3405.70 --> 3408.90]  we will hold up doubt and apathy.
[3410.18 --> 3412.32]  We will look at fear and anger
[3412.32 --> 3413.76]  and envy and jealousy.
[3414.00 --> 3416.10]  We will explore our experience
[3416.10 --> 3418.20]  of despair and hopelessness,
[3418.38 --> 3419.38]  of shame.
[3420.44 --> 3423.14]  And we will look together at joy
[3423.14 --> 3424.76]  and at celebration
[3424.76 --> 3426.74]  and at glorifying.
[3427.60 --> 3429.26]  The image that comes to my mind
[3429.26 --> 3431.10]  is the jeweler's loop
[3431.10 --> 3432.42]  You know the jeweler's loop?
[3432.50 --> 3433.60]  That's the little eyepiece
[3433.60 --> 3434.98]  that she holds up
[3434.98 --> 3436.72]  as she's looking at the diamond
[3436.72 --> 3438.74]  to see all of its facets and colors
[3438.74 --> 3440.90]  and to look deep into within it.
[3440.98 --> 3442.44]  Like a jeweler's loop,
[3442.74 --> 3444.16]  we will look at our emotions
[3444.72 --> 3446.14]  through the lens
[3446.14 --> 3447.78]  of the book of Psalms.
[3449.68 --> 3450.68]  Now, every week,
[3451.42 --> 3452.92]  I write a devotional
[3452.92 --> 3454.08]  on the Psalms
[3454.08 --> 3455.38]  that gets published online,
[3455.38 --> 3457.20]  and so if you read those,
[3457.32 --> 3458.88]  you have heard me say this before.
[3460.00 --> 3461.10]  But I really believe
[3461.10 --> 3462.86]  that one of the beautiful things
[3462.86 --> 3464.40]  about the Psalms
[3464.40 --> 3465.98]  is how they are
[3465.98 --> 3467.48]  the real,
[3467.92 --> 3469.02]  true to life,
[3469.24 --> 3470.22]  unfiltered,
[3470.46 --> 3471.56]  and unfettered,
[3471.84 --> 3475.40]  and yet still divinely authorized
[3475.40 --> 3478.36]  voice of the believer.
[3478.36 --> 3480.74]  I want you to think about that
[3480.74 --> 3482.76]  quickly with me.
[3483.60 --> 3484.94]  As Christians,
[3486.08 --> 3487.22]  we believe
[3487.22 --> 3488.32]  that the Bible
[3488.32 --> 3490.14]  is divinely inspired,
[3490.70 --> 3491.62]  that it is the
[3491.62 --> 3493.48]  infallible word of God.
[3494.06 --> 3495.20]  Now, that means
[3495.20 --> 3496.46]  that it is true,
[3496.64 --> 3497.44]  and it is right,
[3497.54 --> 3498.46]  and it is good,
[3498.50 --> 3499.14]  that the Bible
[3499.14 --> 3501.52]  is the only final authority
[3501.52 --> 3502.80]  in matters of life
[3502.80 --> 3503.88]  and faith.
[3503.88 --> 3507.26]  as the voice of Jesus,
[3507.62 --> 3509.00]  the logos of God,
[3509.14 --> 3509.60]  the Bible
[3509.60 --> 3512.02]  is the powerful word of God
[3512.02 --> 3513.38]  for the church,
[3513.52 --> 3514.10]  for us.
[3515.42 --> 3515.98]  And,
[3516.28 --> 3517.58]  what we also know
[3517.58 --> 3518.68]  is that the Bible
[3518.68 --> 3519.22]  is given
[3519.22 --> 3520.52]  in a particular time
[3520.52 --> 3521.30]  and place
[3521.30 --> 3524.34]  to a particular people
[3524.34 --> 3525.02]  who wrote
[3525.02 --> 3526.42]  in a particular format
[3526.42 --> 3528.26]  using what were normal
[3528.26 --> 3528.94]  to them
[3528.94 --> 3530.32]  literary genres,
[3530.68 --> 3530.86]  right,
[3530.92 --> 3532.18]  and using particular
[3532.18 --> 3532.80]  cultural
[3532.80 --> 3534.00]  and contextually
[3534.00 --> 3535.44]  specific images
[3535.44 --> 3536.86]  and metaphors.
[3538.18 --> 3538.48]  And so,
[3538.58 --> 3539.84]  there are these two things
[3539.84 --> 3540.50]  that are happening
[3540.50 --> 3542.20]  at exactly the same time
[3542.20 --> 3543.12]  in the Bible,
[3543.20 --> 3544.10]  in the whole word of God,
[3544.72 --> 3544.92]  right?
[3544.96 --> 3545.72]  On the one hand,
[3545.82 --> 3546.40]  we recognize
[3546.40 --> 3547.16]  and believe
[3547.16 --> 3547.80]  that the Bible
[3547.80 --> 3549.08]  is God's word,
[3549.22 --> 3550.56]  his revelation to us,
[3550.62 --> 3551.48]  his very word
[3551.48 --> 3553.12]  and his very revelation.
[3553.54 --> 3553.80]  And,
[3553.92 --> 3554.66]  on the other hand,
[3554.72 --> 3556.12]  at the exact same time,
[3556.22 --> 3556.92]  we recognize
[3556.92 --> 3558.40]  that his revelation
[3558.40 --> 3560.56]  has been mediated to us,
[3560.60 --> 3562.02]  has been given to us
[3562.02 --> 3563.76]  through a particular time
[3563.76 --> 3564.48]  in history
[3564.48 --> 3566.02]  and through the voice
[3566.02 --> 3568.12]  of countless different authors
[3568.12 --> 3569.14]  as we don't know
[3569.14 --> 3570.04]  who some of them are
[3570.04 --> 3571.40]  and over the period
[3571.40 --> 3572.58]  of thousands of years.
[3573.94 --> 3574.06]  Right?
[3574.10 --> 3574.94]  This book
[3574.94 --> 3577.72]  is humanity's word
[3577.72 --> 3578.66]  about God,
[3578.72 --> 3580.10]  but it is so much more
[3580.10 --> 3580.48]  than that
[3580.48 --> 3582.20]  because it's God's word
[3582.20 --> 3582.88]  about himself.
[3584.78 --> 3586.04]  In the first letter
[3586.04 --> 3586.56]  of Peter,
[3587.40 --> 3588.46]  he gives us
[3588.46 --> 3589.32]  a good summary
[3589.32 --> 3590.34]  of this,
[3590.34 --> 3591.12]  what we've been talking about.
[3591.36 --> 3592.48]  The theological term
[3592.48 --> 3593.18]  is the doctrine
[3593.18 --> 3594.04]  of inspiration.
[3595.24 --> 3597.46]  But in 1 Peter 1.21,
[3597.78 --> 3598.22]  he says,
[3599.18 --> 3600.78]  people spoke from God
[3600.78 --> 3602.70]  as they were carried along
[3602.70 --> 3603.88]  by the Holy Spirit.
[3604.78 --> 3605.06]  That is,
[3605.20 --> 3606.50]  God gave them words
[3606.50 --> 3607.26]  to speak
[3607.26 --> 3608.46]  and they spoke it
[3608.46 --> 3609.10]  as people
[3609.10 --> 3610.34]  in their unique voice.
[3612.72 --> 3612.88]  Now,
[3612.94 --> 3614.06]  I start here
[3614.06 --> 3615.38]  because perhaps
[3615.38 --> 3617.38]  nowhere else
[3617.38 --> 3618.42]  in all of the Bible
[3618.42 --> 3619.82]  is this doctrine
[3619.82 --> 3620.68]  of inspiration
[3620.68 --> 3621.74]  more clear
[3621.74 --> 3623.48]  than in the Psalms.
[3624.78 --> 3625.78]  The cries
[3625.78 --> 3627.26]  of the psalmist's heart
[3627.26 --> 3629.90]  are the very revelation
[3629.90 --> 3632.04]  of the heart of God.
[3633.94 --> 3634.38]  Now,
[3634.40 --> 3636.92]  holding on to this truth
[3636.92 --> 3638.02]  about the Psalms
[3638.02 --> 3638.78]  and about how they might
[3638.78 --> 3640.00]  function for us,
[3640.78 --> 3643.24]  because this is the first
[3643.24 --> 3643.80]  in the series,
[3643.90 --> 3644.50]  I will tell you
[3644.50 --> 3645.82]  that another book
[3645.82 --> 3646.84]  that Pastor Kevin
[3646.84 --> 3647.72]  and I have read
[3647.72 --> 3648.82]  has been very influential
[3648.82 --> 3650.12]  for us in the discerning
[3650.12 --> 3651.56]  of this series
[3651.56 --> 3652.66]  and helping us plan it
[3652.66 --> 3654.06]  and shape it.
[3654.68 --> 3655.26]  And that book
[3655.26 --> 3655.78]  is called
[3655.78 --> 3657.06]  The Cry of the Soul,
[3657.32 --> 3658.62]  How Our Emotions
[3658.62 --> 3660.16]  Reveal Our Deepest Questions
[3660.16 --> 3661.38]  About God.
[3661.42 --> 3663.04]  It's by Dr. Dan Allender
[3663.04 --> 3665.10]  and Dr. Trempert Longman.
[3665.38 --> 3665.62]  Actually,
[3665.72 --> 3666.48]  Kevin had to read
[3666.48 --> 3666.96]  that book
[3666.96 --> 3668.30]  for one of his classes
[3668.30 --> 3669.00]  in seminary
[3669.00 --> 3669.90]  like a year ago.
[3670.36 --> 3671.10]  And at that time,
[3671.14 --> 3672.04]  he showed it to me
[3672.04 --> 3673.32]  and I was intrigued by it.
[3673.36 --> 3674.38]  So then I read through it
[3674.38 --> 3675.40]  and thought it was really good
[3675.40 --> 3676.50]  and important for us
[3676.50 --> 3678.20]  as we discern together
[3678.20 --> 3680.10]  how to live faithfully
[3680.10 --> 3683.36]  as people of hope
[3683.36 --> 3684.90]  in this present darkness.
[3686.16 --> 3687.86]  Crying out at the injustices
[3687.86 --> 3688.88]  we see in the world
[3688.88 --> 3690.04]  and living at a time
[3690.04 --> 3690.94]  and a place
[3690.94 --> 3692.92]  where feelings of isolation
[3692.92 --> 3694.00]  and loneliness
[3694.00 --> 3695.30]  and hopelessness
[3695.30 --> 3696.68]  and of despair
[3696.68 --> 3697.62]  and of depression
[3697.62 --> 3698.56]  and anxiety
[3698.56 --> 3700.26]  are just skyrocketing.
[3700.26 --> 3701.98]  And so,
[3702.30 --> 3704.86]  we want to enter
[3704.86 --> 3706.76]  into this present moment
[3706.76 --> 3708.46]  intentionally
[3708.46 --> 3710.22]  and biblically
[3710.22 --> 3711.26]  and centered
[3711.26 --> 3712.14]  on the word
[3712.14 --> 3713.36]  of God
[3713.36 --> 3713.96]  and the gospel
[3713.96 --> 3714.58]  of Jesus
[3714.58 --> 3715.78]  that we might be encouraged
[3715.78 --> 3717.04]  to live in obedience to him
[3717.04 --> 3717.92]  that we might be encouraged
[3717.92 --> 3719.36]  by the hope of the gospel
[3719.36 --> 3720.30]  that we might be encouraged
[3720.30 --> 3721.04]  to know that
[3721.04 --> 3722.04]  that even
[3722.04 --> 3723.46]  in the valley
[3723.46 --> 3724.28]  of the shadow
[3724.28 --> 3725.48]  of death
[3725.48 --> 3728.02]  no matter what valley
[3728.02 --> 3728.56]  of the shadow
[3728.56 --> 3729.04]  of death
[3729.04 --> 3730.72]  you might be walking in
[3730.72 --> 3732.70]  God is with us
[3732.70 --> 3735.30]  He is with you
[3735.30 --> 3736.38]  here.
[3737.44 --> 3738.46]  And so to start us off
[3738.46 --> 3739.14]  we're going to read
[3739.14 --> 3741.16]  from Psalm 130
[3741.16 --> 3742.58]  I'm just going to read
[3742.58 --> 3743.76]  the first four verses
[3743.76 --> 3745.42]  with you.
[3745.42 --> 3749.30]  Out of the depths
[3749.30 --> 3750.62]  I cry to you
[3750.62 --> 3751.56]  Lord
[3751.56 --> 3752.52]  Lord
[3752.52 --> 3753.10]  hear
[3753.10 --> 3754.40]  my voice
[3754.40 --> 3755.38]  let your ears
[3755.38 --> 3756.10]  be attentive
[3756.10 --> 3757.12]  to my cry
[3757.12 --> 3757.76]  for mercy
[3757.76 --> 3759.74]  if you
[3759.74 --> 3760.16]  Lord
[3760.16 --> 3760.88]  kept a record
[3760.88 --> 3761.58]  of sins
[3761.58 --> 3762.26]  Lord
[3762.26 --> 3763.42]  who could stand
[3763.42 --> 3765.10]  but with you
[3765.10 --> 3766.30]  there is forgiveness
[3766.30 --> 3767.86]  so that we can
[3767.86 --> 3769.18]  with reverence
[3769.18 --> 3770.48]  serve you.
[3771.10 --> 3771.92]  This is the word
[3771.92 --> 3772.34]  of the Lord.
[3772.34 --> 3776.80]  Out of the depths
[3776.80 --> 3778.00]  I cry
[3778.00 --> 3779.28]  to you
[3779.28 --> 3780.24]  Lord
[3780.24 --> 3781.78]  Lord
[3781.78 --> 3782.66]  hear
[3782.66 --> 3783.50]  my
[3783.50 --> 3784.54]  voice
[3784.54 --> 3786.92]  That one line
[3786.92 --> 3787.70]  could be
[3787.70 --> 3788.46]  our theme
[3788.46 --> 3789.50]  this morning
[3789.50 --> 3790.18]  right
[3790.18 --> 3790.66]  that is the
[3790.66 --> 3792.24]  idea around which
[3792.24 --> 3793.42]  we're going to lay
[3793.42 --> 3794.18]  the foundation
[3794.18 --> 3795.58]  for the series
[3795.58 --> 3796.28]  ahead
[3796.28 --> 3798.06]  Out of the depths
[3798.06 --> 3798.86]  I cry
[3798.86 --> 3799.66]  to you
[3799.66 --> 3800.62]  Lord
[3800.62 --> 3800.68]  Lord
[3830.62 --> 3831.72]  both above
[3831.72 --> 3832.54]  and apart
[3832.54 --> 3834.18]  of his creation
[3834.18 --> 3834.92]  as holy
[3834.92 --> 3836.30]  and transcendent
[3836.30 --> 3837.44]  but then also
[3837.44 --> 3838.36]  about how God
[3838.36 --> 3839.22]  enters into
[3839.22 --> 3840.26]  his creation
[3840.26 --> 3841.44]  as imminent
[3841.44 --> 3842.32]  and present
[3842.32 --> 3843.04]  in the lives
[3843.04 --> 3843.94]  of believers
[3843.94 --> 3844.94]  both as the
[3844.94 --> 3845.82]  sovereign ruler
[3845.82 --> 3847.30]  by whose will
[3847.30 --> 3847.78]  alone
[3847.78 --> 3848.84]  the very hairs
[3848.84 --> 3849.76]  fall from our head
[3849.76 --> 3850.62]  but also
[3850.62 --> 3851.36]  as the one
[3851.36 --> 3852.56]  who holds us
[3852.56 --> 3854.06]  and upholds us
[3854.06 --> 3854.54]  in the midst
[3854.54 --> 3855.58]  of whatever struggle
[3855.58 --> 3856.52]  or trial
[3856.52 --> 3857.32]  or hardship
[3857.32 --> 3858.52]  or valley
[3858.52 --> 3859.58]  or dark night
[3859.58 --> 3860.24]  of the soul
[3860.24 --> 3861.02]  that we face
[3861.02 --> 3864.28]  another theologian
[3864.28 --> 3865.66]  has said that
[3865.66 --> 3866.74]  the Psalms
[3866.74 --> 3867.60]  are in the Bible
[3867.60 --> 3868.64]  to give us
[3868.64 --> 3869.64]  a full range
[3869.64 --> 3870.32]  of ways
[3870.32 --> 3871.38]  to approach God
[3871.38 --> 3873.16]  the Psalms
[3873.16 --> 3874.14]  are deeply aware
[3874.14 --> 3875.00]  of the diversity
[3875.00 --> 3876.08]  of human emotions
[3876.08 --> 3877.02]  and experiences
[3877.02 --> 3878.00]  and they help us
[3878.00 --> 3878.92]  by giving categories
[3878.92 --> 3879.98]  and language
[3879.98 --> 3881.10]  to approach God
[3881.10 --> 3881.98]  wherever
[3881.98 --> 3883.72]  wherever we are at
[3883.72 --> 3884.88]  in our lives
[3884.88 --> 3887.96]  now I mentioned
[3887.96 --> 3888.34]  this briefly
[3888.34 --> 3888.66]  at the beginning
[3888.66 --> 3889.08]  but maybe
[3889.08 --> 3889.78]  this series
[3889.78 --> 3891.42]  will make you
[3891.42 --> 3892.46]  read and
[3892.46 --> 3893.02]  memorize
[3893.02 --> 3894.20]  the Psalms
[3894.20 --> 3895.60]  and if that's
[3895.60 --> 3896.48]  a takeaway for you
[3896.48 --> 3897.50]  that in my mind
[3897.50 --> 3897.80]  and heart
[3897.80 --> 3898.80]  would be a huge success
[3898.80 --> 3902.32]  now as we
[3902.32 --> 3903.42]  come to the Psalms
[3903.42 --> 3904.90]  I think
[3904.90 --> 3905.82]  that it is
[3905.82 --> 3907.06]  equally as
[3907.06 --> 3908.12]  important for us
[3908.12 --> 3908.86]  to
[3908.86 --> 3910.34]  realize
[3910.34 --> 3911.02]  that the
[3911.02 --> 3912.00]  Psalms
[3912.00 --> 3912.92]  have
[3912.92 --> 3914.64]  grounded
[3914.64 --> 3916.66]  the liturgy
[3916.66 --> 3917.54]  of the church
[3917.54 --> 3918.50]  and of the Jewish
[3918.50 --> 3919.10]  tradition
[3919.10 --> 3920.16]  that is now
[3920.16 --> 3921.12]  three and a half
[3921.12 --> 3922.12]  thousand years old
[3922.12 --> 3923.36]  right
[3923.36 --> 3923.74]  there is
[3923.74 --> 3924.26]  something
[3924.26 --> 3925.02]  beautiful
[3925.02 --> 3925.98]  about the
[3925.98 --> 3927.38]  the solidity
[3927.38 --> 3928.22]  of our
[3928.22 --> 3929.14]  ability to
[3929.14 --> 3929.54]  worship
[3929.54 --> 3930.58]  in the voice
[3930.58 --> 3931.90]  and with the words
[3931.90 --> 3932.76]  of believers
[3932.76 --> 3933.58]  who have come
[3933.58 --> 3935.30]  generations before us
[3935.30 --> 3936.04]  who have come
[3936.04 --> 3936.66]  millennia
[3936.66 --> 3937.66]  before us
[3937.66 --> 3938.34]  and so maybe
[3938.34 --> 3939.58]  you're the kind of person
[3939.58 --> 3940.00]  who thinks
[3940.00 --> 3940.96]  there's something beautiful
[3940.96 --> 3942.46]  about the genevan structure
[3942.46 --> 3943.40]  to the
[3943.40 --> 3944.06]  the Psalms
[3944.06 --> 3945.94]  or maybe
[3945.94 --> 3946.80]  you're the kind of person
[3946.80 --> 3947.54]  who thinks there's something
[3947.54 --> 3948.68]  beautiful to the way
[3948.68 --> 3949.38]  Shane and Shane
[3949.38 --> 3950.64]  have have taken in the
[3950.64 --> 3951.38]  contemporary world
[3951.38 --> 3951.94]  these Psalms
[3951.94 --> 3952.74]  and made them
[3952.74 --> 3953.52]  majestic
[3953.52 --> 3954.58]  to sing again
[3954.58 --> 3956.76]  the point there
[3956.76 --> 3957.52]  is right
[3957.52 --> 3958.18]  through
[3958.18 --> 3959.78]  thousands of years
[3959.78 --> 3961.36]  the church has used
[3961.36 --> 3961.86]  these words
[3961.86 --> 3962.54]  in some form
[3962.54 --> 3963.06]  or another
[3963.06 --> 3964.38]  to worship
[3964.38 --> 3966.30]  and what's more
[3966.30 --> 3967.46]  the early church
[3967.46 --> 3968.86]  very clearly
[3968.86 --> 3969.38]  saw
[3969.38 --> 3970.80]  how these Psalms
[3970.80 --> 3971.76]  foreshadowed
[3971.76 --> 3971.96]  that is
[3971.96 --> 3972.84]  anticipated
[3972.84 --> 3973.82]  and ultimately
[3973.82 --> 3974.92]  found their fulfillment
[3974.92 --> 3976.08]  in the birth
[3976.08 --> 3976.58]  life
[3976.58 --> 3976.92]  death
[3976.92 --> 3977.46]  resurrection
[3977.46 --> 3978.38]  and exaltation
[3978.38 --> 3979.22]  of Jesus
[3979.22 --> 3979.96]  and his kingdom
[3979.96 --> 3980.36]  come
[3980.36 --> 3981.14]  and his kingdom
[3981.14 --> 3981.60]  coming
[3981.60 --> 3982.08]  which he
[3982.08 --> 3982.94]  ushered in
[3982.94 --> 3986.00]  now
[3986.00 --> 3987.76]  I want to
[3987.76 --> 3989.34]  just acknowledge
[3989.34 --> 3990.06]  that I'm going to
[3990.06 --> 3991.02]  pause for a second
[3991.02 --> 3992.10]  and give you just a
[3992.10 --> 3993.46]  brief history lesson
[3993.46 --> 3994.96]  now I know not all of you
[3994.96 --> 3995.68]  love that the way
[3995.68 --> 3996.34]  I love that
[3996.34 --> 3997.58]  and so you can get
[3997.58 --> 3998.42]  mad at me afterwards
[3998.42 --> 3999.70]  but that's fine
[3999.70 --> 4000.18]  we're going to do it
[4000.18 --> 4000.88]  anyway because I'm up
[4000.88 --> 4001.06]  here
[4001.06 --> 4004.74]  but I think it's
[4004.74 --> 4005.46]  important for us
[4005.46 --> 4005.88]  to hear
[4005.88 --> 4007.96]  and I'll draw a thread
[4007.96 --> 4008.40]  through
[4008.40 --> 4009.60]  so listen for the thread
[4009.60 --> 4012.20]  in the fourth
[4012.20 --> 4012.84]  century
[4012.84 --> 4014.36]  there was a
[4014.36 --> 4015.46]  church leader
[4015.46 --> 4016.84]  who became a church
[4016.84 --> 4017.14]  father
[4017.14 --> 4017.68]  and was named
[4017.68 --> 4018.72]  eventually as a saint
[4018.72 --> 4020.12]  called Athanasius
[4020.12 --> 4021.28]  right
[4021.28 --> 4022.02]  whose teaching
[4022.02 --> 4023.38]  in the early church
[4023.38 --> 4024.26]  would be instrumental
[4024.26 --> 4025.26]  in the council
[4025.26 --> 4025.98]  of Nicaea
[4025.98 --> 4026.50]  which was in
[4026.50 --> 4027.36]  325
[4027.36 --> 4028.42]  and then
[4028.42 --> 4029.58]  though after his death
[4029.58 --> 4030.28]  would also be
[4030.28 --> 4031.58]  influential in the next
[4031.58 --> 4032.64]  ecumenical council
[4032.64 --> 4033.80]  in Constantinople
[4033.80 --> 4034.32]  in 3
[4034.32 --> 4035.74]  oh Josh
[4035.74 --> 4036.22]  83
[4036.22 --> 4037.70]  something like that
[4037.70 --> 4039.32]  perfect
[4039.32 --> 4043.22]  Athanasius wrote a
[4043.22 --> 4043.90]  short letter
[4043.90 --> 4044.50]  to
[4044.50 --> 4046.30]  Marcellinus
[4046.30 --> 4047.34]  on the book
[4047.34 --> 4047.88]  of Psalms
[4047.88 --> 4049.36]  and I want to share
[4049.36 --> 4050.02]  his words
[4050.02 --> 4051.14]  for you
[4051.14 --> 4052.56]  he writes
[4052.56 --> 4053.66]  in the book
[4053.66 --> 4054.28]  of Psalms
[4054.28 --> 4055.18]  you will find
[4055.18 --> 4055.70]  depicted
[4055.70 --> 4057.08]  in it
[4057.08 --> 4058.16]  all the movements
[4058.16 --> 4059.44]  of your soul
[4059.44 --> 4060.94]  all its changes
[4060.94 --> 4062.18]  its ups and downs
[4062.18 --> 4062.94]  its failures
[4062.94 --> 4063.88]  and recoveries
[4063.88 --> 4065.10]  moreover
[4065.10 --> 4066.16]  whatever your
[4066.16 --> 4067.28]  particular need
[4067.28 --> 4067.84]  or trouble
[4067.84 --> 4069.06]  from this same book
[4069.06 --> 4070.00]  you can select
[4070.00 --> 4071.12]  a form of word
[4071.12 --> 4071.88]  to fit it
[4071.88 --> 4073.08]  so that you do not
[4073.08 --> 4073.96]  merely hear
[4073.96 --> 4075.02]  and then pass on
[4075.02 --> 4076.38]  but learn the way
[4076.38 --> 4077.48]  to remedy
[4077.48 --> 4079.42]  your will
[4079.42 --> 4082.30]  as those
[4082.30 --> 4083.06]  who have come
[4083.06 --> 4084.08]  before us
[4084.08 --> 4085.20]  can testify
[4085.20 --> 4085.98]  my prayer
[4085.98 --> 4086.76]  in this series
[4086.76 --> 4087.26]  is that we will
[4087.26 --> 4088.28]  not only hear
[4088.28 --> 4089.06]  the truth
[4089.06 --> 4089.92]  of our emotions
[4089.92 --> 4091.04]  we will not only
[4091.04 --> 4092.00]  see how God
[4092.00 --> 4093.62]  enters into them
[4093.62 --> 4094.64]  but as
[4094.64 --> 4095.70]  Athanasius said
[4095.70 --> 4096.56]  we will learn
[4096.56 --> 4097.08]  the way
[4097.08 --> 4097.86]  to remedy
[4097.86 --> 4098.88]  your will
[4098.88 --> 4100.18]  or your desires
[4100.18 --> 4101.80]  now
[4101.80 --> 4103.22]  continuing the history lesson
[4103.22 --> 4103.84]  jump forward
[4103.84 --> 4104.48]  a little over
[4104.48 --> 4105.38]  a thousand years
[4105.38 --> 4106.02]  to the time
[4106.02 --> 4106.84]  of the reformation
[4106.84 --> 4108.78]  in the 16th century
[4108.78 --> 4109.92]  you have
[4109.92 --> 4110.62]  Martin Luther
[4110.62 --> 4113.46]  who many would say
[4113.46 --> 4115.68]  is the instigator
[4115.68 --> 4116.30]  the starter
[4116.30 --> 4117.70]  of the reformation
[4117.70 --> 4118.30]  he says
[4118.30 --> 4119.22]  of the psalms
[4119.22 --> 4119.88]  that they are
[4119.88 --> 4120.98]  like a treasure
[4120.98 --> 4122.22]  hidden in the field
[4122.22 --> 4122.92]  and he goes on
[4122.92 --> 4123.36]  to say
[4123.36 --> 4125.68]  the psalms
[4125.68 --> 4126.58]  could well be
[4126.58 --> 4127.14]  entitled
[4127.14 --> 4128.34]  a little bible
[4128.34 --> 4129.54]  since everything
[4129.54 --> 4130.36]  contained in the
[4130.36 --> 4131.06]  entire bible
[4131.06 --> 4131.78]  is beautifully
[4131.78 --> 4132.82]  and briefly
[4132.82 --> 4133.60]  comprehended
[4133.60 --> 4134.50]  and compacted
[4134.50 --> 4135.24]  into a short
[4135.24 --> 4135.78]  handbook
[4135.78 --> 4137.02]  you can see
[4137.02 --> 4138.06]  and it is precious
[4138.06 --> 4138.56]  to us
[4138.56 --> 4139.18]  because most
[4139.18 --> 4139.64]  clearly
[4139.64 --> 4140.34]  the promises
[4140.34 --> 4141.14]  of the death
[4141.14 --> 4142.14]  and the resurrection
[4142.14 --> 4142.82]  of Christ
[4142.82 --> 4143.76]  and the descriptions
[4143.76 --> 4144.90]  of his kingdom
[4144.90 --> 4145.58]  and the nature
[4145.58 --> 4146.18]  and standing
[4146.18 --> 4147.14]  of all Christian
[4147.14 --> 4147.58]  people
[4147.58 --> 4148.64]  are revealed
[4148.64 --> 4151.36]  at the same time
[4151.36 --> 4152.22]  as Luther
[4152.22 --> 4153.62]  you have
[4153.62 --> 4154.30]  John Calvin
[4154.30 --> 4155.64]  who will say
[4155.64 --> 4157.32]  what various
[4157.32 --> 4158.26]  and resplendent
[4158.26 --> 4158.58]  riches
[4158.58 --> 4159.38]  are contained
[4159.38 --> 4160.40]  in this treasury
[4160.40 --> 4161.66]  it were difficult
[4161.66 --> 4162.44]  to describe
[4162.44 --> 4163.74]  I have been
[4163.74 --> 4164.60]  want to call
[4164.60 --> 4165.14]  this book
[4165.14 --> 4166.48]  not inappropriately
[4166.48 --> 4167.60]  an anatomy
[4167.60 --> 4168.92]  of all parts
[4168.92 --> 4169.72]  of the soul
[4169.72 --> 4172.14]  I think Calvin
[4172.14 --> 4173.02]  is away with words
[4173.02 --> 4173.32]  there
[4173.32 --> 4174.50]  an anatomy
[4174.50 --> 4176.12]  of all parts
[4176.12 --> 4177.48]  of the soul
[4177.48 --> 4178.88]  for there is not
[4178.88 --> 4179.46]  an emotion
[4179.46 --> 4180.42]  of which anyone
[4180.42 --> 4181.28]  can be conscious
[4181.28 --> 4182.68]  that is not here
[4182.68 --> 4183.38]  represented
[4183.38 --> 4185.00]  as in a mirror
[4185.00 --> 4187.86]  now like I said
[4187.86 --> 4188.40]  I know that
[4188.40 --> 4189.38]  not everyone
[4189.38 --> 4190.24]  loves history
[4190.24 --> 4190.78]  the way that
[4190.78 --> 4191.64]  I do
[4191.64 --> 4192.96]  but I think
[4192.96 --> 4193.54]  this is really
[4193.54 --> 4194.52]  important for us
[4194.52 --> 4194.94]  to see
[4194.94 --> 4195.92]  that throughout
[4195.92 --> 4197.20]  all the ages
[4197.20 --> 4198.28]  the Christian faith
[4198.28 --> 4198.94]  and tradition
[4198.94 --> 4200.04]  as we connect
[4200.04 --> 4200.74]  even back
[4200.74 --> 4201.60]  to Moses
[4201.60 --> 4202.54]  and the very first
[4202.54 --> 4203.56]  words recorded
[4203.56 --> 4204.48]  in the Bible
[4204.48 --> 4205.46]  that the Psalter
[4205.46 --> 4206.74]  has been the voice
[4206.74 --> 4207.86]  of God
[4207.86 --> 4208.90]  to his people
[4208.90 --> 4209.88]  and the voice
[4209.88 --> 4210.92]  of his people
[4210.92 --> 4212.28]  in all of our struggles
[4212.28 --> 4213.70]  right the Psalter
[4213.70 --> 4214.70]  has been our voice
[4214.70 --> 4215.16]  to God
[4215.16 --> 4215.62]  in the midst
[4215.62 --> 4216.68]  of whatever we face
[4216.68 --> 4217.70]  and so now
[4217.70 --> 4218.54]  as we begin
[4218.54 --> 4219.14]  a series
[4219.14 --> 4220.02]  on faith
[4220.02 --> 4221.66]  and all our feelings
[4221.66 --> 4223.28]  what I really
[4223.28 --> 4224.78]  hope you hear
[4224.78 --> 4226.92]  is that
[4226.92 --> 4228.34]  the sorts of things
[4228.34 --> 4229.22]  we teach
[4229.22 --> 4230.52]  myself and Pastor Kevin
[4230.52 --> 4231.86]  the things that we say
[4231.86 --> 4232.56]  up here
[4232.56 --> 4234.20]  we're not
[4234.20 --> 4235.50]  providing
[4235.50 --> 4236.96]  a form
[4236.96 --> 4238.08]  of pop psychology
[4238.08 --> 4240.16]  right
[4240.16 --> 4240.52]  we're not
[4240.52 --> 4241.38]  living into
[4241.38 --> 4242.20]  a fad
[4242.20 --> 4242.52]  or
[4242.52 --> 4244.16]  a new
[4244.16 --> 4244.70]  sort of
[4244.70 --> 4245.40]  constructed
[4245.40 --> 4246.02]  modern
[4246.02 --> 4246.78]  anthropology
[4246.78 --> 4247.22]  we're not
[4247.22 --> 4247.92]  operating out
[4247.92 --> 4248.68]  of that kind
[4248.68 --> 4249.30]  of understanding
[4249.30 --> 4250.12]  of the human
[4250.12 --> 4250.46]  person
[4250.46 --> 4250.90]  but what we're
[4250.90 --> 4251.60]  talking about
[4251.60 --> 4252.18]  what we are
[4252.18 --> 4252.80]  experiencing
[4252.80 --> 4253.20]  together
[4253.20 --> 4253.60]  what we're
[4253.60 --> 4253.98]  offering
[4253.98 --> 4254.22]  is
[4254.22 --> 4255.40]  the very
[4255.40 --> 4256.32]  word
[4256.32 --> 4257.24]  and revelation
[4257.24 --> 4258.40]  of God
[4258.40 --> 4259.62]  to your heart
[4259.62 --> 4260.40]  and the words
[4260.40 --> 4260.76]  that have been
[4260.76 --> 4261.60]  with the church
[4261.60 --> 4262.10]  of Jesus
[4262.10 --> 4262.78]  since her
[4262.78 --> 4263.88]  very beginning
[4263.88 --> 4265.58]  if you are
[4265.58 --> 4266.42]  ever wondering
[4266.42 --> 4267.34]  how to best
[4267.34 --> 4268.16]  understand
[4268.16 --> 4269.26]  yourself
[4269.26 --> 4270.26]  and your emotions
[4270.26 --> 4270.90]  how to best
[4270.90 --> 4272.22]  see your life
[4272.22 --> 4273.06]  and your feelings
[4273.06 --> 4274.18]  and all of their
[4274.18 --> 4274.58]  facets
[4274.58 --> 4275.46]  as we hold up
[4275.46 --> 4276.26]  the jeweler's loop
[4276.26 --> 4278.80]  it should be
[4278.80 --> 4279.56]  through the eyes
[4279.56 --> 4280.24]  of God
[4280.24 --> 4281.18]  who created
[4281.18 --> 4281.80]  you
[4281.80 --> 4283.92]  who created
[4283.92 --> 4285.34]  your heart
[4285.34 --> 4287.14]  and has spelled
[4287.14 --> 4287.98]  out for us
[4287.98 --> 4289.18]  our faith
[4289.18 --> 4291.58]  because you see
[4291.58 --> 4292.70]  if we were to
[4292.70 --> 4293.50]  base our
[4293.50 --> 4294.44]  counsel here
[4294.44 --> 4295.06]  and what we say
[4295.06 --> 4296.14]  here on a modern
[4296.14 --> 4297.26]  understanding of the world
[4297.26 --> 4297.86]  or a secular
[4297.86 --> 4298.38]  understanding
[4298.38 --> 4298.82]  of the human
[4298.82 --> 4299.16]  person
[4299.16 --> 4300.04]  our counsel
[4300.04 --> 4300.72]  would be a lot
[4300.72 --> 4301.28]  different
[4301.28 --> 4303.40]  now
[4303.40 --> 4304.84]  hear me
[4304.84 --> 4305.38]  when I say
[4305.38 --> 4305.68]  this
[4305.68 --> 4307.02]  and I'm
[4307.02 --> 4307.68]  going to
[4307.68 --> 4308.80]  lean forward
[4308.80 --> 4310.22]  and I'm
[4310.22 --> 4310.42]  going to
[4310.42 --> 4312.00]  slow down
[4312.00 --> 4313.22]  so that you
[4313.22 --> 4313.80]  get that I'm
[4313.80 --> 4314.50]  being very
[4314.50 --> 4315.24]  intentional
[4315.24 --> 4316.60]  and I want
[4316.60 --> 4317.44]  you to hear
[4317.44 --> 4317.98]  right
[4317.98 --> 4318.40]  I'm going to
[4318.40 --> 4319.16]  make eye
[4319.16 --> 4319.52]  contact
[4319.52 --> 4320.32]  with as many
[4320.32 --> 4320.80]  of you
[4320.80 --> 4321.90]  as possible
[4321.90 --> 4324.02]  I am not
[4324.02 --> 4325.64]  in this moment
[4325.64 --> 4326.68]  from this stage
[4326.68 --> 4327.96]  dismissing the value
[4327.96 --> 4328.48]  of therapy
[4328.48 --> 4330.24]  I am not
[4330.24 --> 4331.00]  in this moment
[4331.00 --> 4331.80]  from this stage
[4331.80 --> 4333.18]  decrying
[4333.18 --> 4334.26]  modern psychology
[4334.26 --> 4335.94]  I am not
[4335.94 --> 4336.48]  undermining
[4336.48 --> 4337.10]  the value
[4337.10 --> 4338.14]  and the benefits
[4338.14 --> 4339.02]  of modern medicine
[4339.02 --> 4339.62]  for helping
[4339.62 --> 4340.34]  things
[4340.34 --> 4341.08]  and help
[4341.08 --> 4341.86]  things like
[4341.86 --> 4342.30]  depression
[4342.30 --> 4343.24]  or anxiety
[4343.24 --> 4345.10]  now I do think
[4345.10 --> 4345.64]  we need to ask
[4345.64 --> 4346.60]  some hard questions
[4346.60 --> 4347.82]  I do think
[4347.82 --> 4348.20]  we need to
[4348.20 --> 4349.16]  wonder about
[4349.16 --> 4350.16]  the presuppositions
[4350.16 --> 4350.82]  and the
[4350.82 --> 4351.94]  foundations of
[4351.94 --> 4352.66]  these ways
[4352.66 --> 4353.12]  of seeing
[4353.12 --> 4353.60]  the world
[4353.60 --> 4353.96]  that we need
[4353.96 --> 4354.44]  to test
[4354.44 --> 4355.30]  every truth
[4355.30 --> 4355.90]  against what
[4355.90 --> 4356.68]  scripture says
[4356.68 --> 4357.66]  that we need
[4357.66 --> 4358.40]  to discern
[4358.40 --> 4359.10]  God's will
[4359.10 --> 4360.00]  and deconstruct
[4360.00 --> 4360.80]  what the Bible
[4360.80 --> 4361.56]  calls hollow
[4361.56 --> 4362.20]  and deceptive
[4362.20 --> 4362.76]  philosophy
[4362.76 --> 4366.60]  I will say
[4366.60 --> 4367.16]  that I have
[4367.16 --> 4367.70]  benefited
[4367.70 --> 4368.64]  from counseling
[4368.64 --> 4369.74]  and from therapy
[4369.74 --> 4371.94]  but I also
[4371.94 --> 4372.32]  think
[4372.32 --> 4374.28]  that a lot
[4374.28 --> 4375.84]  of therapy
[4375.84 --> 4376.26]  bills
[4376.26 --> 4377.74]  could be
[4377.74 --> 4378.44]  at least
[4378.44 --> 4379.24]  mitigated
[4379.24 --> 4380.44]  if you just
[4380.44 --> 4380.72]  talk to
[4380.72 --> 4381.18]  your pastors
[4381.18 --> 4382.60]  or
[4382.60 --> 4383.42]  more importantly
[4383.42 --> 4383.92]  if you just
[4383.92 --> 4384.26]  talk to
[4384.26 --> 4384.68]  each other
[4384.68 --> 4385.68]  with the
[4385.68 --> 4385.98]  psalter
[4385.98 --> 4386.30]  in your
[4386.30 --> 4386.62]  hands
[4386.62 --> 4388.84]  I do think
[4388.84 --> 4389.26]  that there is
[4389.26 --> 4389.94]  an eminently
[4389.94 --> 4391.28]  practical value
[4391.28 --> 4391.80]  to the sort
[4391.80 --> 4392.22]  of biblical
[4392.22 --> 4392.88]  and spiritual
[4392.88 --> 4393.32]  counseling
[4393.32 --> 4393.82]  that we can
[4393.82 --> 4394.68]  do here
[4394.68 --> 4395.50]  and I do
[4395.50 --> 4395.80]  believe
[4395.80 --> 4396.18]  that one
[4396.18 --> 4396.40]  of the
[4396.40 --> 4396.64]  reasons
[4396.64 --> 4397.06]  why so
[4397.06 --> 4397.64]  many people
[4397.64 --> 4398.34]  are in
[4398.34 --> 4398.66]  therapy
[4398.66 --> 4398.98]  today
[4398.98 --> 4399.40]  is because
[4399.40 --> 4399.80]  so many
[4399.80 --> 4400.08]  people
[4400.08 --> 4400.58]  don't have
[4400.58 --> 4400.94]  the kind
[4400.94 --> 4401.48]  of community
[4401.48 --> 4402.06]  that you're
[4402.06 --> 4402.64]  sitting in
[4402.64 --> 4403.66]  right now
[4403.66 --> 4405.20]  the kind
[4405.20 --> 4405.60]  of people
[4405.60 --> 4406.20]  who long
[4406.20 --> 4406.64]  for your
[4406.64 --> 4407.28]  well-being
[4407.28 --> 4408.60]  and wholeness
[4408.60 --> 4409.64]  and restoration
[4409.64 --> 4410.80]  and strength
[4410.80 --> 4411.74]  and integrity
[4411.74 --> 4414.08]  and then finally
[4414.08 --> 4415.78]  in this little
[4415.78 --> 4416.16]  caveat
[4416.16 --> 4417.88]  I also hope
[4417.88 --> 4418.62]  that you don't
[4418.62 --> 4419.42]  hear me saying
[4419.42 --> 4420.00]  in the midst
[4420.00 --> 4420.72]  of your struggles
[4420.72 --> 4421.94]  just read your
[4421.94 --> 4422.20]  bible
[4422.20 --> 4423.94]  and I'm not
[4423.94 --> 4424.48]  trying to quote
[4424.48 --> 4425.18]  a couple verses
[4425.18 --> 4425.84]  at you
[4425.84 --> 4426.54]  and put a
[4426.54 --> 4427.28]  band-aid over
[4427.28 --> 4428.36]  whatever it is
[4428.36 --> 4428.94]  that you're facing
[4428.94 --> 4429.80]  send you on your
[4429.80 --> 4430.62]  way out the door
[4430.62 --> 4431.26]  and then kind of
[4431.26 --> 4431.72]  just check
[4431.72 --> 4432.72]  my own box
[4432.72 --> 4433.26]  and say good
[4433.26 --> 4433.80]  work pastor
[4433.80 --> 4434.42]  chris another
[4434.42 --> 4434.98]  job well
[4434.98 --> 4435.28]  done
[4435.28 --> 4437.46]  if you've
[4437.46 --> 4438.04]  actually ever
[4438.04 --> 4438.62]  sat with me
[4438.62 --> 4439.22]  for counseling
[4439.22 --> 4440.58]  you know that
[4440.58 --> 4441.02]  what I do
[4441.02 --> 4441.56]  mostly is
[4441.56 --> 4441.96]  listen
[4441.96 --> 4443.74]  and then maybe
[4443.74 --> 4444.64]  ask a good
[4444.64 --> 4445.24]  question or
[4445.24 --> 4445.88]  hopefully a
[4445.88 --> 4446.46]  good question
[4446.46 --> 4447.34]  or two
[4447.34 --> 4449.52]  and yet
[4449.52 --> 4450.70]  I also want
[4450.70 --> 4451.08]  to be clear
[4451.08 --> 4451.42]  because I
[4451.42 --> 4451.78]  really do
[4451.78 --> 4452.80]  believe that
[4452.80 --> 4453.70]  if we knew
[4453.70 --> 4454.38]  God's word
[4454.38 --> 4455.08]  more that is
[4455.08 --> 4455.82]  if our heart
[4455.82 --> 4456.30]  of hearts
[4456.30 --> 4456.88]  were filled
[4456.88 --> 4457.40]  with the
[4457.40 --> 4458.06]  very voice
[4458.06 --> 4458.58]  of God
[4458.58 --> 4458.92]  if our
[4458.92 --> 4459.74]  imaginations
[4459.74 --> 4460.38]  could readily
[4460.38 --> 4461.24]  call to mind
[4461.24 --> 4461.84]  the very
[4461.84 --> 4462.24]  voice
[4462.24 --> 4462.88]  of Jesus
[4462.88 --> 4463.60]  that would
[4463.60 --> 4463.92]  make a
[4463.92 --> 4464.42]  difference
[4464.42 --> 4465.70]  in your
[4465.70 --> 4466.10]  life
[4466.10 --> 4467.04]  and in
[4467.04 --> 4467.18]  your
[4467.18 --> 4467.80]  experiences
[4467.80 --> 4469.28]  I do
[4469.28 --> 4469.88]  believe
[4469.88 --> 4470.16]  that
[4470.16 --> 4470.90]  God's
[4470.90 --> 4471.14]  word
[4471.14 --> 4471.74]  goes out
[4471.74 --> 4472.28]  and does
[4472.28 --> 4472.96]  not return
[4472.96 --> 4473.40]  to him
[4473.40 --> 4473.64]  without
[4473.64 --> 4474.18]  accomplishing
[4474.18 --> 4474.70]  the purposes
[4474.70 --> 4475.30]  for which
[4475.30 --> 4476.12]  he sent
[4476.12 --> 4476.42]  it
[4476.42 --> 4478.28]  if that
[4478.28 --> 4478.74]  sounds like
[4478.74 --> 4478.98]  God's
[4478.98 --> 4479.16]  word
[4479.16 --> 4479.32]  it's
[4479.32 --> 4479.50]  because
[4479.50 --> 4479.92]  it is
[4479.92 --> 4480.76]  Isaiah
[4480.76 --> 4481.18]  55
[4481.18 --> 4481.96]  11
[4481.96 --> 4485.88]  now
[4485.88 --> 4487.78]  lastly
[4487.78 --> 4488.82]  for our
[4488.82 --> 4489.02]  time
[4489.02 --> 4489.22]  this
[4489.22 --> 4489.50]  morning
[4489.50 --> 4490.22]  and I'll
[4490.22 --> 4491.42]  begin to
[4491.42 --> 4491.76]  land the
[4491.76 --> 4492.00]  plane
[4492.00 --> 4492.48]  here with
[4492.48 --> 4492.76]  this
[4492.76 --> 4493.86]  and I'll
[4493.86 --> 4494.16]  quote
[4494.16 --> 4494.72]  from
[4494.72 --> 4495.86]  Allender
[4495.86 --> 4496.34]  and Longman
[4496.34 --> 4496.58]  again
[4496.58 --> 4496.90]  the cry
[4496.90 --> 4497.10]  of the
[4497.10 --> 4497.32]  soul
[4497.32 --> 4499.38]  the authors
[4499.38 --> 4499.68]  write
[4499.68 --> 4501.50]  our
[4501.50 --> 4501.92]  culture
[4501.92 --> 4502.60]  presumes
[4502.60 --> 4503.34]  that
[4503.34 --> 4503.94]  emotions
[4503.94 --> 4504.34]  are
[4504.34 --> 4505.10]  amoral
[4505.10 --> 4505.72]  that is
[4505.72 --> 4505.88]  they're
[4505.88 --> 4506.04]  neither
[4506.04 --> 4506.48]  right
[4506.48 --> 4507.00]  nor
[4507.00 --> 4507.32]  wrong
[4507.32 --> 4508.28]  and
[4508.28 --> 4508.54]  according
[4508.54 --> 4508.92]  to this
[4508.92 --> 4509.44]  perspective
[4509.44 --> 4510.42]  it's not
[4510.42 --> 4511.02]  what we
[4511.02 --> 4511.56]  feel
[4511.56 --> 4511.94]  that is
[4511.94 --> 4512.34]  potentially
[4512.34 --> 4512.78]  sinful
[4512.78 --> 4513.64]  but rather
[4513.64 --> 4514.04]  what we
[4514.04 --> 4514.46]  do
[4514.46 --> 4514.96]  with our
[4514.96 --> 4515.36]  feelings
[4515.36 --> 4516.90]  the problem
[4516.90 --> 4517.34]  with this
[4517.34 --> 4517.62]  view
[4517.62 --> 4518.10]  is its
[4518.10 --> 4518.58]  assumption
[4518.58 --> 4519.22]  that some
[4519.22 --> 4519.64]  element
[4519.64 --> 4520.08]  of our
[4520.08 --> 4520.76]  personality
[4520.76 --> 4521.38]  escaped
[4521.38 --> 4521.64]  the
[4521.64 --> 4522.30]  consequences
[4522.30 --> 4523.20]  of the
[4523.20 --> 4523.50]  fall
[4523.50 --> 4526.30]  in the
[4526.30 --> 4526.60]  church
[4526.60 --> 4526.94]  when we
[4526.94 --> 4527.20]  say
[4527.20 --> 4527.74]  the fall
[4527.74 --> 4527.96]  we're
[4527.96 --> 4528.28]  talking
[4528.28 --> 4528.72]  about
[4528.72 --> 4529.46]  how
[4529.46 --> 4529.78]  sin
[4529.78 --> 4530.10]  entered
[4530.10 --> 4530.30]  the
[4530.30 --> 4530.56]  world
[4530.56 --> 4531.20]  and how
[4531.20 --> 4531.42]  sin
[4531.42 --> 4531.74]  has
[4531.74 --> 4532.84]  impacted
[4532.84 --> 4533.46]  everything
[4533.46 --> 4534.30]  right
[4534.30 --> 4534.50]  and so
[4534.50 --> 4535.14]  sometimes
[4535.14 --> 4536.28]  when talking
[4536.28 --> 4536.60]  about our
[4536.60 --> 4536.94]  feelings
[4536.94 --> 4538.04]  we say
[4538.04 --> 4538.88]  things like
[4538.88 --> 4539.84]  I just
[4539.84 --> 4540.36]  feel this
[4540.36 --> 4540.62]  way
[4540.62 --> 4541.40]  or we
[4541.40 --> 4541.54]  say
[4541.54 --> 4541.92]  things like
[4541.92 --> 4542.28]  I can't
[4542.28 --> 4542.72]  help how
[4542.72 --> 4542.90]  I'm
[4542.90 --> 4543.22]  feeling
[4543.22 --> 4543.68]  or
[4543.68 --> 4544.74]  this
[4544.74 --> 4544.92]  one
[4544.92 --> 4545.34]  I hear
[4545.34 --> 4546.02]  you can't
[4546.02 --> 4546.44]  tell me
[4546.44 --> 4546.82]  that what
[4546.82 --> 4546.98]  I'm
[4546.98 --> 4547.26]  feeling
[4547.26 --> 4547.70]  is right
[4547.70 --> 4548.14]  or wrong
[4548.14 --> 4549.36]  and in
[4549.36 --> 4549.54]  some
[4549.54 --> 4549.84]  cases
[4549.84 --> 4550.14]  that's
[4550.14 --> 4550.46]  true
[4550.46 --> 4551.40]  right
[4551.40 --> 4551.74]  it's
[4551.74 --> 4551.94]  hard
[4551.94 --> 4552.12]  to
[4552.12 --> 4552.44]  control
[4552.44 --> 4552.70]  our
[4552.70 --> 4553.16]  feelings
[4553.16 --> 4553.62]  and
[4553.62 --> 4553.96]  when
[4553.96 --> 4554.24]  it's
[4554.24 --> 4554.50]  hard
[4554.50 --> 4554.70]  to
[4554.70 --> 4555.00]  control
[4555.00 --> 4555.20]  our
[4555.20 --> 4555.48]  feelings
[4555.48 --> 4555.74]  it
[4555.74 --> 4556.00]  might
[4556.00 --> 4556.28]  be
[4556.28 --> 4556.44]  in
[4556.44 --> 4556.58]  that
[4556.58 --> 4556.80]  moment
[4556.80 --> 4557.06]  more
[4557.06 --> 4557.54]  important
[4557.54 --> 4558.16]  to
[4558.16 --> 4558.92]  work
[4558.92 --> 4559.10]  on
[4559.10 --> 4559.46]  controlling
[4559.46 --> 4559.66]  how
[4559.66 --> 4559.78]  you
[4559.78 --> 4560.26]  respond
[4560.26 --> 4560.52]  to
[4560.52 --> 4560.70]  them
[4560.70 --> 4561.42]  or
[4561.42 --> 4561.52]  how
[4561.52 --> 4561.68]  you
[4561.68 --> 4562.06]  handle
[4562.06 --> 4562.40]  them
[4562.40 --> 4563.90]  but
[4563.90 --> 4564.16]  and
[4564.16 --> 4564.34]  this
[4564.34 --> 4564.72]  is
[4564.72 --> 4565.20]  Allender
[4565.20 --> 4565.44]  and
[4565.44 --> 4566.10]  Longman's
[4566.10 --> 4566.46]  point
[4566.46 --> 4567.96]  human
[4567.96 --> 4568.96]  depravity
[4568.96 --> 4569.94]  is
[4569.94 --> 4570.52]  pervasive
[4570.52 --> 4571.86]  that is
[4571.86 --> 4572.64]  the effects
[4572.64 --> 4573.20]  of sin
[4573.20 --> 4573.84]  have spread
[4573.84 --> 4574.62]  into every
[4574.62 --> 4575.16]  aspect
[4575.16 --> 4575.80]  of who
[4575.80 --> 4576.24]  you are
[4576.24 --> 4576.52]  and so
[4576.52 --> 4577.12]  our minds
[4577.12 --> 4577.94]  have fallen
[4577.94 --> 4578.54]  have been
[4578.54 --> 4578.84]  affected
[4578.84 --> 4579.36]  by sin
[4579.36 --> 4579.56]  our
[4579.56 --> 4580.58]  wills
[4580.58 --> 4581.26]  have fallen
[4581.26 --> 4581.88]  and are
[4581.88 --> 4582.06]  now
[4582.06 --> 4583.10]  plagued
[4583.10 --> 4583.54]  with the
[4583.54 --> 4584.10]  struggle
[4584.10 --> 4584.76]  of sin
[4584.76 --> 4585.34]  and our
[4585.34 --> 4585.78]  hearts
[4585.78 --> 4586.24]  and our
[4586.24 --> 4586.94]  desires
[4586.94 --> 4588.10]  have fallen
[4588.10 --> 4588.64]  our
[4588.64 --> 4589.46]  feelings
[4589.46 --> 4590.64]  are affected
[4590.64 --> 4591.02]  by the
[4591.02 --> 4591.30]  fall
[4591.30 --> 4594.40]  and some
[4594.40 --> 4594.70]  of you
[4594.70 --> 4595.52]  intuitively
[4595.52 --> 4596.38]  know this
[4596.38 --> 4596.70]  but have
[4596.70 --> 4597.02]  not been
[4597.02 --> 4597.30]  able to
[4597.30 --> 4597.72]  put words
[4597.72 --> 4597.94]  to it
[4597.94 --> 4598.30]  before
[4598.30 --> 4599.94]  because
[4599.94 --> 4600.34]  intuitively
[4600.34 --> 4600.70]  you go
[4600.70 --> 4602.08]  I know
[4602.08 --> 4602.56]  I don't
[4602.56 --> 4603.06]  I shouldn't
[4603.06 --> 4603.48]  feel this
[4603.48 --> 4603.68]  way
[4603.68 --> 4603.88]  and I
[4603.88 --> 4604.06]  don't
[4604.06 --> 4604.38]  want
[4604.38 --> 4604.74]  to feel
[4604.74 --> 4604.94]  this
[4604.94 --> 4605.12]  way
[4605.12 --> 4605.40]  but I'm
[4605.40 --> 4605.60]  still
[4605.60 --> 4606.02]  feeling
[4606.02 --> 4606.28]  this
[4606.28 --> 4606.44]  way
[4606.44 --> 4606.70]  and that's
[4606.70 --> 4606.82]  not
[4606.82 --> 4607.34]  me
[4607.34 --> 4607.76]  again
[4607.76 --> 4608.32]  passively
[4608.32 --> 4608.78]  accepting
[4608.78 --> 4609.02]  that
[4609.02 --> 4609.26]  that's
[4609.26 --> 4609.42]  just
[4609.42 --> 4609.70]  saying
[4609.70 --> 4610.48]  yeah
[4610.48 --> 4611.32]  exactly
[4611.32 --> 4613.46]  the fall
[4613.46 --> 4614.26]  has affected
[4614.26 --> 4615.64]  our hearts
[4615.64 --> 4616.44]  and what we
[4616.44 --> 4616.66]  feel
[4616.66 --> 4617.20]  and the
[4617.20 --> 4617.64]  psalms
[4617.64 --> 4618.10]  themselves
[4618.10 --> 4618.42]  we could
[4618.42 --> 4618.80]  go anywhere
[4618.80 --> 4619.14]  in scripture
[4619.14 --> 4619.46]  to make
[4619.46 --> 4619.82]  this point
[4619.82 --> 4620.04]  but I'll
[4620.04 --> 4620.54]  just give
[4620.54 --> 4620.86]  you two
[4620.86 --> 4621.50]  psalms
[4621.50 --> 4622.06]  to make
[4622.06 --> 4622.48]  this point
[4622.48 --> 4623.12]  to keep
[4623.12 --> 4623.48]  us in
[4623.48 --> 4623.90]  this book
[4623.90 --> 4624.30]  psalm
[4624.30 --> 4625.38]  14
[4625.38 --> 4626.46]  says
[4626.46 --> 4626.86]  the lord
[4626.86 --> 4627.40]  looks down
[4627.40 --> 4628.10]  from heaven
[4628.10 --> 4628.76]  on mankind
[4628.76 --> 4629.44]  to see
[4629.44 --> 4629.84]  if there
[4629.84 --> 4630.40]  are any
[4630.40 --> 4631.42]  who understand
[4631.42 --> 4631.82]  any
[4631.82 --> 4632.42]  who seek
[4632.42 --> 4632.80]  god
[4632.80 --> 4634.00]  but all
[4634.00 --> 4634.46]  have turned
[4634.46 --> 4634.80]  away
[4634.80 --> 4635.84]  all have
[4635.84 --> 4636.24]  become
[4636.24 --> 4636.80]  corrupt
[4636.80 --> 4637.80]  there is
[4637.80 --> 4638.42]  no one
[4638.42 --> 4638.92]  who does
[4638.92 --> 4639.34]  good
[4639.34 --> 4640.42]  not even
[4640.42 --> 4641.30]  one
[4641.30 --> 4642.94]  right
[4642.94 --> 4643.12]  that
[4643.12 --> 4644.52]  the depravity
[4644.52 --> 4645.38]  has affected
[4645.38 --> 4646.06]  everyone
[4646.06 --> 4647.14]  in every
[4647.14 --> 4648.18]  aspect
[4648.18 --> 4649.16]  50
[4649.16 --> 4649.96]  psalm 58
[4649.96 --> 4650.40]  says
[4650.40 --> 4651.26]  no
[4651.26 --> 4651.98]  in your
[4651.98 --> 4652.38]  heart

[4653.26 --> 4653.92]  injustice
[4653.92 --> 4654.36]  and your
[4654.36 --> 4654.68]  hands
[4654.68 --> 4655.20]  met out
[4655.20 --> 4655.72]  violence
[4655.72 --> 4656.02]  on the
[4656.02 --> 4656.22]  earth
[4656.22 --> 4656.70]  even
[4656.70 --> 4657.06]  from
[4657.06 --> 4657.60]  birth
[4657.60 --> 4657.96]  the
[4657.96 --> 4658.26]  wicked
[4658.26 --> 4658.66]  go
[4658.66 --> 4659.24]  astray
[4659.24 --> 4659.82]  from
[4659.82 --> 4660.04]  the
[4660.04 --> 4660.46]  womb
[4660.46 --> 4660.70]  they
[4660.70 --> 4660.92]  are
[4660.92 --> 4661.52]  wayward
[4661.52 --> 4662.18]  spreading
[4662.18 --> 4663.16]  lies
[4663.16 --> 4663.90]  we
[4663.90 --> 4663.92]  we
[4663.92 --> 4663.94]  we
[4663.94 --> 4663.96]  we
[4663.96 --> 4663.98]  we
[4663.98 --> 4664.06]  are
[4664.06 --> 4664.76]  born
[4664.76 --> 4665.22]  into
[4665.22 --> 4665.66]  this
[4665.66 --> 4666.36]  reality
[4666.36 --> 4666.78]  of
[4666.78 --> 4667.08]  sin
[4667.08 --> 4667.38]  and so
[4667.38 --> 4667.98]  of course
[4667.98 --> 4668.82]  that affects
[4668.82 --> 4669.38]  our hearts
[4669.38 --> 4669.90]  and our
[4669.90 --> 4670.32]  emotions
[4670.32 --> 4670.92]  and our
[4670.92 --> 4671.26]  minds
[4671.26 --> 4671.66]  right
[4671.66 --> 4672.22]  our emotions
[4672.22 --> 4673.14]  don't escape
[4673.14 --> 4673.96]  depravity
[4673.96 --> 4674.52]  and its
[4674.52 --> 4675.10]  effects
[4675.10 --> 4676.18]  and so
[4676.18 --> 4676.92]  with the help
[4676.92 --> 4677.24]  of the
[4677.24 --> 4677.96]  holy spirit
[4677.96 --> 4678.80]  with the power
[4678.80 --> 4679.52]  of the voice
[4679.52 --> 4680.04]  of god
[4680.04 --> 4680.94]  with the book
[4680.94 --> 4681.48]  of psalms
[4681.48 --> 4682.10]  we are called
[4682.10 --> 4682.88]  to master
[4682.88 --> 4683.36]  them
[4683.36 --> 4684.58]  right
[4684.58 --> 4685.04]  that is to
[4685.04 --> 4685.84]  learn about
[4685.84 --> 4686.10]  them
[4686.10 --> 4686.40]  and to
[4686.40 --> 4687.16]  reflect
[4687.16 --> 4687.92]  on them
[4687.92 --> 4688.80]  to hold
[4688.80 --> 4689.30]  them up
[4689.30 --> 4690.00]  to the light
[4690.00 --> 4690.50]  that is
[4690.50 --> 4691.36]  jesus christ
[4691.36 --> 4691.94]  and to be
[4691.94 --> 4692.78]  transformed
[4692.78 --> 4693.64]  by the renewing
[4693.64 --> 4694.22]  of our minds
[4694.22 --> 4694.80]  so that even
[4694.80 --> 4695.70]  our emotional
[4695.70 --> 4696.24]  selves
[4696.24 --> 4697.00]  look more
[4697.00 --> 4698.10]  like jesus
[4698.10 --> 4699.12]  out of the depths
[4699.12 --> 4700.50]  i cry to you
[4700.50 --> 4701.28]  lord
[4701.28 --> 4703.22]  lord
[4703.22 --> 4703.86]  hear
[4703.86 --> 4704.52]  my
[4704.52 --> 4705.52]  voice
[4705.52 --> 4708.04]  jesus
[4708.04 --> 4708.86]  did this
[4708.86 --> 4710.28]  and he
[4710.28 --> 4711.06]  he cried
[4711.06 --> 4712.12]  this prayer
[4712.12 --> 4715.34]  in
[4715.34 --> 4717.34]  in luke 22
[4717.34 --> 4719.40]  jesus is in the
[4719.40 --> 4719.74]  garden
[4719.74 --> 4720.82]  before he
[4720.82 --> 4721.38]  is betrayed
[4721.38 --> 4722.28]  before he
[4722.28 --> 4722.76]  goes to the
[4722.76 --> 4723.14]  cross
[4723.14 --> 4723.44]  and he
[4723.44 --> 4723.80]  prays
[4723.80 --> 4724.24]  father
[4724.24 --> 4725.06]  if it
[4725.06 --> 4725.40]  is at all
[4725.40 --> 4725.84]  possible
[4725.84 --> 4727.00]  take this
[4727.00 --> 4727.42]  cup
[4727.42 --> 4728.34]  from me
[4728.34 --> 4730.34]  now the
[4730.34 --> 4730.84]  cup
[4730.84 --> 4731.34]  that jesus
[4731.34 --> 4732.02]  is referring
[4732.02 --> 4732.40]  to
[4732.40 --> 4733.12]  is a
[4733.12 --> 4733.46]  prophetic
[4733.46 --> 4734.00]  image
[4734.00 --> 4735.06]  that is
[4735.06 --> 4735.28]  used
[4735.28 --> 4735.72]  in places
[4735.72 --> 4735.94]  like
[4735.94 --> 4736.68]  psalm 75
[4736.68 --> 4738.58]  or isaiah 51
[4738.58 --> 4739.92]  to show
[4739.92 --> 4741.14]  the wrath
[4741.14 --> 4741.76]  of god's
[4741.76 --> 4742.16]  judgment
[4742.16 --> 4742.76]  for sin
[4742.76 --> 4744.38]  right
[4744.38 --> 4744.92]  and on
[4744.92 --> 4745.64]  the cross
[4745.64 --> 4746.38]  breathing
[4746.38 --> 4746.98]  out his
[4746.98 --> 4747.48]  last
[4747.48 --> 4748.08]  jesus
[4748.08 --> 4748.96]  cries out
[4748.96 --> 4749.74]  my god
[4749.74 --> 4750.32]  my god
[4750.32 --> 4750.98]  why have
[4750.98 --> 4751.58]  you forsaken
[4751.58 --> 4752.00]  me
[4752.00 --> 4754.06]  that's
[4754.06 --> 4754.92]  psalm 22
[4754.92 --> 4757.18]  right
[4757.18 --> 4759.56]  in his
[4759.56 --> 4760.48]  deepest
[4760.48 --> 4761.74]  depths
[4761.74 --> 4763.94]  in the
[4763.94 --> 4764.48]  darkest
[4764.48 --> 4765.62]  moments
[4765.62 --> 4766.50]  of jesus
[4766.50 --> 4767.64]  life
[4767.64 --> 4769.72]  he cries
[4769.72 --> 4770.26]  out
[4770.26 --> 4771.78]  with the
[4771.78 --> 4772.56]  songs
[4772.56 --> 4773.76]  and prayers
[4773.76 --> 4774.96]  of his
[4774.96 --> 4775.42]  people
[4775.42 --> 4778.80]  and his
[4778.80 --> 4779.18]  father
[4779.18 --> 4779.68]  hears
[4779.68 --> 4780.04]  him
[4780.04 --> 4782.70]  and his
[4782.70 --> 4783.06]  father
[4783.06 --> 4783.60]  raises
[4783.60 --> 4784.06]  him
[4784.06 --> 4785.18]  from the
[4785.18 --> 4785.46]  dead
[4785.46 --> 4787.36]  and on
[4787.36 --> 4788.20]  the cross
[4788.20 --> 4788.98]  jesus
[4788.98 --> 4789.56]  cries
[4789.56 --> 4789.94]  out
[4789.94 --> 4790.82]  with words
[4790.82 --> 4791.62]  of worship
[4791.62 --> 4793.88]  in his
[4793.88 --> 4794.44]  grief
[4794.44 --> 4797.64]  he uses
[4797.64 --> 4799.90]  a song
[4799.90 --> 4800.50]  of worship
[4800.50 --> 4802.56]  you see
[4802.56 --> 4802.80]  there's a
[4802.80 --> 4803.12]  mistake
[4803.12 --> 4803.84]  that persists
[4803.84 --> 4804.22]  in the
[4804.22 --> 4804.48]  modern
[4804.48 --> 4804.96]  church
[4804.96 --> 4806.04]  that our
[4806.04 --> 4806.26]  worship
[4806.26 --> 4806.74]  has to be
[4806.74 --> 4807.18]  joyful
[4807.18 --> 4807.96]  it has to
[4807.96 --> 4808.44]  be happy
[4808.44 --> 4809.26]  and clappy
[4809.26 --> 4809.70]  and that if
[4809.70 --> 4810.42]  we can't
[4810.42 --> 4810.92]  raise our
[4810.92 --> 4811.24]  hands
[4811.24 --> 4811.78]  with smiles
[4811.78 --> 4812.12]  on our
[4812.12 --> 4812.40]  faces
[4812.40 --> 4813.20]  that anything
[4813.20 --> 4813.62]  other than
[4813.62 --> 4814.10]  that is not
[4814.10 --> 4814.38]  worship
[4814.38 --> 4814.78]  but in the
[4814.78 --> 4815.14]  bible
[4815.14 --> 4815.78]  worship
[4815.78 --> 4816.18]  is
[4816.18 --> 4816.66]  my god
[4816.66 --> 4817.14]  my god
[4817.14 --> 4817.62]  why have
[4817.62 --> 4818.20]  you forsaken
[4818.20 --> 4818.50]  me
[4818.50 --> 4819.70]  in the
[4819.70 --> 4820.02]  bible
[4820.02 --> 4820.40]  worship
[4820.40 --> 4820.84]  is the
[4820.84 --> 4821.40]  depths
[4821.40 --> 4822.06]  of your
[4822.06 --> 4822.64]  pain
[4822.64 --> 4823.50]  being brought
[4823.50 --> 4823.84]  to the
[4823.84 --> 4824.30]  presence
[4824.30 --> 4825.54]  of our
[4825.54 --> 4825.88]  father
[4825.88 --> 4828.90]  and so
[4828.90 --> 4830.28]  I ask
[4830.28 --> 4830.60]  you
[4830.60 --> 4832.28]  whatever

[4923.28 --> 4924.38]  glorified
[4924.38 --> 4927.12]  so that
[4927.12 --> 4928.74]  the dark
[4928.74 --> 4929.26]  night of
[4929.26 --> 4929.98]  your soul

[4935.14 --> 4935.96]  every
[4935.96 --> 4937.04]  morning
[4937.04 --> 4939.20]  that too
[4939.20 --> 4940.68]  is a
[4940.68 --> 4941.24]  psalm
[4941.24 --> 4943.68]  the voice
[4943.68 --> 4944.72]  of the
[4944.72 --> 4945.14]  psalter
[4945.14 --> 4946.60]  the voice
[4946.60 --> 4947.18]  of Jesus
[4947.18 --> 4948.32]  for your
[4948.32 --> 4948.74]  heart
[4948.74 --> 4949.88]  in worship
[4949.88 --> 4952.12]  no matter
[4952.12 --> 4952.80]  when
[4952.80 --> 4954.22]  or what
[4954.22 --> 4955.14]  you are
[4955.14 --> 4955.68]  facing
[4955.68 --> 4958.16]  the cries
[4958.16 --> 4959.12]  of your

[4959.74 --> 4960.68]  are heard
[4960.68 --> 4962.04]  by the
[4962.04 --> 4962.60]  ears of
[4962.60 --> 4962.98]  God
[4962.98 --> 4964.58]  and he
[4964.58 --> 4965.04]  comes to

[4965.28 --> 4966.12]  he comes
[4966.12 --> 4966.40]  to you
[4966.40 --> 4966.70]  now

[4967.14 --> 4967.42]  to you
[4967.42 --> 4967.82]  here
[4967.82 --> 4969.12]  and he

[4969.76 --> 4972.12]  let me
[4972.12 --> 4972.38]  pray
[4972.38 --> 4979.88]  out of
[4979.88 --> 4980.34]  the depths
[4980.34 --> 4981.08]  we cry
[4981.08 --> 4981.66]  to you

[5126.38 --> 5127.80]  and death
[5127.80 --> 5135.34]  what truth

[5281.32 --> 5282.70]  now
[5282.70 --> 5283.54]  and ever
[5283.54 --> 5284.04]  we
[5284.04 --> 5284.36]  confess
[5284.36 --> 5286.36]  Christ
[5286.36 --> 5287.36]  our hope
[5287.36 --> 5288.18]  in life
[5288.18 --> 5289.50]  and death
[5289.50 --> 5290.52]  now
[5290.52 --> 5291.40]  and ever
[5291.40 --> 5291.98]  we
[5291.98 --> 5293.40]  confess
[5293.40 --> 5294.52]  Christ
[5294.52 --> 5295.42]  our hope
[5295.42 --> 5296.34]  in life
[5296.34 --> 5298.36]  and death
[5298.36 --> 5299.38]  when our
[5299.38 --> 5303.56]  amen
[5303.56 --> 5316.90]  in my heart and in my life, I'm trying to be attentive to the moving of the Spirit and
[5316.90 --> 5323.94]  the voice of God, and so I'm going off script a little bit to change the closing blessing
[5323.94 --> 5329.88]  and to end our service this morning with the concluding words of the Bible from Revelation
[5329.88 --> 5338.46]  22, because even as we reflect on the depths of our emotions and struggles, even as we go,
[5338.98 --> 5354.52]  sometimes we go hearing and feeling that I have to change my heart. Sometimes we go hearing and
[5354.52 --> 5365.22]  feeling in guilt because our vision of hope is too small. So the hope we are offered, the light at
[5365.22 --> 5373.92]  the end of the tunnel, as it were, is the restoration of all things, when all will be made new. And so
[5373.92 --> 5379.40]  hear this promise of God as our closing blessing this morning.
[5379.40 --> 5389.00]  The Spirit and the Bride say, Come. And let the one who hears say, Come. Let the one who is thirsty,
[5389.18 --> 5394.60]  come. And let the one who wishes to take the free gift of the water of life, come.
[5396.72 --> 5406.72]  He who testifies to these things says, Yes, I am coming soon. Amen. Come, Lord Jesus. The grace of
[5406.72 --> 5413.72]  the Lord Jesus be with God's people forever. Amen. Amen.
[5436.72 --> 5466.70]  Praise the Lord, from whom all blessings flow. He has washed and made me white as snow. I'm redeemed from the
[5466.70 --> 5496.68]  from all my sin and shame. Now and forever. Praise His holy name. Praise His holy name. Praise His holy name.
[5496.68 --> 5526.66]  Praise the Lord, from whom all blessings flow. He has washed and made me white as snow. I'm redeemed from the
[5526.66 --> 5556.64]  from all my sin and shame. I'm redeemed from all my sin and shame. Now and forever. Praise His holy name. Praise His holy name.
[5556.64 --> 5586.62]  Praise His holy name. Praise His holy name. Praise His holy name. To God be the glory, now and forever. Praise His holy name. Praise His holy name.
[5586.62 --> 5591.62]  Praise His holy name. To God be the glory, now and forever. Praise His holy name.
[5591.62 --> 5593.62]  To God be the glory, now and forever. Praise His holy name.
[5593.62 --> 5598.62]  To God be the glory, now and forever. Praise His holy name.
[5598.62 --> 5612.06]  Praise His holy name. Just a reminder for all of you 18 and up, and remember, here we're having a brief meeting right now.
[5612.06 --> 5618.20]  So if you're a guest here, here we're having a brief meeting right now. So if you're a guest here, need to grab a coffee, please make your way to the foyer. Otherwise, please stick around as we have a quick meeting here.
[5642.06 --> 5663.48]  Good morning, everyone.
[5663.48 --> 5680.16]  Good morning, everyone. My intention is to make this quick so we can have coffee and get outside and enjoy the sunshine. So thank you for all being here this morning for this exciting time where we get to present this young adult proposal to you, and we can vote on it this morning.
[5680.16 --> 5682.08]  Thank you.
[5682.08 --> 5683.92]  I just want to give you a little bit of an overview.
