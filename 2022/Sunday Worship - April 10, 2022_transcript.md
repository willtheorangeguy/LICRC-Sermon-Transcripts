[0.00 --> 4.40]  More than my feet could ever want
[4.40 --> 8.08]  And my faith will be made stronger
[8.08 --> 12.08]  In the presence of my Savior
[28.24 --> 28.92]  Okay
[28.92 --> 29.92]  Peace
[29.92 --> 59.90]  Thank you.
[59.92 --> 89.90]  Thank you.
[89.92 --> 119.90]  Thank you.
[119.92 --> 149.90]  Thank you.
[149.92 --> 151.92]  Thank you.
[179.92 --> 181.92]  Thank you.
[209.92 --> 211.92]  Thank you.
[239.92 --> 241.92]  Thank you.
[269.92 --> 271.92]  Thank you.
[299.92 --> 301.92]  Thank you.
[329.92 --> 331.92]  Thank you.
[331.92 --> 333.92]  Thank you.
[333.92 --> 335.92]  Thank you.
[335.92 --> 337.92]  Thank you.
[337.92 --> 343.92]  Thank you.
[343.92 --> 347.92]  Thank you.
[347.92 --> 358.82]  Good morning.
[359.44 --> 360.04]  Buenos dias.
[361.38 --> 365.38]  Welcome to our church.
[365.86 --> 367.16]  Bienvenidos a nuestra iglesia.
[367.68 --> 369.02]  My name is Chris.
[369.20 --> 371.00]  I'm one of the pastors here,
[371.00 --> 373.62]  and it's my privilege, along with these others,
[373.78 --> 376.94]  to lead us in worship this morning.
[376.94 --> 380.62]  If you look around and you see a bunch of palm branches waving,
[380.76 --> 381.74]  there's a reason for that.
[381.82 --> 382.88]  Who's got their palm branches?
[384.50 --> 385.44]  Excellent, Haley.
[386.34 --> 389.30]  There are plenty for more than just the kids,
[389.68 --> 391.66]  and so if you would like a palm branch, please.
[392.48 --> 393.18]  I don't want to.
[393.54 --> 394.00]  Hey, Rich.
[394.82 --> 396.10]  Rich, sport, Rich.
[396.90 --> 398.96]  Rich, are there still palm branches back there?
[399.52 --> 400.80]  All right, so there's lots.
[401.42 --> 402.66]  So if you want one during our worship,
[402.78 --> 406.10]  please go grab one or five or the like,
[406.10 --> 408.54]  and we will use that in our singing together.
[410.58 --> 413.32]  Just want to make a couple announcements before we begin.
[413.58 --> 415.82]  First of all, as it is Palm Sunday,
[416.00 --> 417.76]  that marks the beginning of Holy Week,
[417.98 --> 421.62]  and so we will gather for worship on Good Friday
[421.62 --> 423.60]  in the evening at 6 p.m.
[423.92 --> 425.90]  You're invited to join us for that.
[426.04 --> 428.00]  Invite your family, friends, neighbors,
[428.54 --> 431.62]  as we gather to remember the death of Jesus.
[431.62 --> 434.50]  And then we will gather again on Easter Sunday
[434.50 --> 437.66]  at a regular time of 10 a.m.
[439.18 --> 443.16]  Also, just a reminder that the sign-up for pastor's class
[443.16 --> 445.56]  can happen at the welcome table,
[445.68 --> 447.28]  the children's worship time table back there,
[447.36 --> 450.40]  and so if you are thinking about profession of faith
[450.40 --> 452.90]  or if you have questions about membership in our church,
[452.96 --> 455.52]  that's a great place to start that conversation.
[455.80 --> 457.52]  And so you can sign up there afterwards,
[457.60 --> 459.06]  or you can grab me, ask questions,
[459.06 --> 460.56]  and I'll work through that with you.
[461.18 --> 462.40]  And then also just a reminder,
[462.40 --> 466.34]  although based on the spam of messages
[466.34 --> 468.18]  I got this morning on Instagram,
[468.42 --> 469.42]  you don't need the reminder.
[469.62 --> 471.52]  We are in the midst of Treat Tag here
[471.52 --> 473.66]  for the month of, thank you,
[474.04 --> 475.62]  for the month of April.
[475.88 --> 477.86]  And so if you don't know what that is,
[478.04 --> 480.76]  check out our YouTube channel and see the video there.
[481.52 --> 483.16]  And thank you to everybody
[483.16 --> 485.72]  who's been eagerly participating in that
[485.72 --> 488.96]  and sharing that and developing our community in that way.
[489.06 --> 492.12]  One more.
[492.82 --> 496.60]  After church, there is the Mexico Mission lunch.
[497.16 --> 499.58]  And so we're going to gather and have a luncheon,
[499.90 --> 500.84]  soup and buns,
[501.02 --> 502.58]  and hear stories from those
[502.58 --> 505.48]  who went on the Mexico Mission trip a couple weeks ago.
[505.64 --> 508.20]  And so you are invited to stick around for that.
[508.88 --> 509.88]  Dolores, apologies,
[510.08 --> 511.56]  but even if you didn't bring buns,
[512.14 --> 513.68]  you're allowed to stick around for that lunch.
[514.54 --> 516.28]  You just have to leave $5 or something.
[516.28 --> 516.70]  No, I'm kidding.
[517.60 --> 518.94]  Please stick around for lunch
[518.94 --> 520.52]  and let's enjoy that time together.
[522.00 --> 524.58]  I'm going to begin us with a reading of Scripture
[524.58 --> 525.70]  and then God's greeting.
[525.82 --> 526.88]  So I'm going to, as you are able,
[527.08 --> 527.92]  invite you to stand.
[528.34 --> 529.86]  We can gather in God's presence together.
[529.86 --> 540.38]  Scripture from Mark 11.
[542.18 --> 545.10]  As they approached Jerusalem
[545.10 --> 547.82]  and came to Bethpage and Bethany
[547.82 --> 549.40]  at the Mount of Olives,
[550.84 --> 555.02]  Jesus and His disciples went in
[555.02 --> 557.76]  and they brought to Jesus the colt
[557.76 --> 564.10]  and they threw their cloaks over it and he sat on it. Many people spread their cloaks out on the
[564.10 --> 570.32]  road and while others spread branches that they had cut in the fields. And those that went ahead
[570.32 --> 577.36]  and those who followed shouted, Hosanna, Hosanna, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[577.36 --> 584.34]  Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David. Hosanna in the highest.
[584.34 --> 594.72]  This morning we join our voices with the church throughout time and space to sing Hosanna to our
[594.72 --> 605.52]  Lord. We gather in the presence of our God and so receive his greeting. Grace, mercy, peace to you.
[606.28 --> 613.56]  God our father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, son, our savior and king, and through the presence and power
[613.56 --> 618.80]  the Holy Spirit. Amen. Hosanna. Let's worship God together.
[620.42 --> 623.56]  Good morning everyone and welcome to our Palm Sunday service.
[624.00 --> 627.86]  Kids, can I see your palm branches? Yeah, and adults too if you want.
[628.26 --> 633.14]  We have a couple of Hosanna songs here today so when we sing those feel free to come up to the front
[633.14 --> 637.50]  and wave your palm branches around and go up and down the aisles. Have a little bit of fun.
[637.50 --> 643.40]  It's a fun Sunday today. Our call to worship is from Psalms 118.
[644.16 --> 650.62]  Oh give thanks to the Lord for he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever. Let Israel say,
[650.88 --> 657.00]  his steadfast love endures forever. Let the house of Aaron say, his steadfast love endures forever.
[657.00 --> 662.40]  Let those who fear the Lord say, his steadfast love endures forever.
[662.40 --> 687.74]  Come, now is the time to worship.
[687.74 --> 712.74]  Come, now is the time to give your heart. Come, just as you are to worship. Come, just as you are before your God. Come.
[712.74 --> 722.74]  One day every tongue will confess you are God. One day every knee will bow.
[722.74 --> 730.74]  Still the greatest treasure remains for those who gladly choose you now.
[730.74 --> 760.72]  Come, now is the time to worship. Come, just as you are before your heart. Come, just as you are before your heart.
[760.72 --> 761.34]  Come, just as you are before your heart. Come.
[761.34 --> 762.72]  Come, just as you are before your heart. Come, just as you are surrounded.
[762.72 --> 766.72]  Come, just as you are before your heart. Come, just as you are before your heart. Come, just as you are before your heart.
[766.72 --> 773.72]  One day every tongue will confess you are God. One day every knee will bow.
[773.72 --> 781.50]  Still the greatest treasure remains for those who gladly choose you now.
[783.50 --> 789.98]  Willingly we choose to surrender our lives, willingly our knees will bow.
[791.22 --> 797.72]  With all our heart, soul, mind and strength, we gladly choose you now.
[797.72 --> 807.72]  Come, now is the time to worship you.
[808.50 --> 814.72]  Come, now is the time to give your heart.
[816.08 --> 822.72]  Come, just as you are to worship you.
[822.72 --> 831.90]  Come, just as you are before your God.
[832.64 --> 832.94]  Come.
[832.94 --> 842.86]  Come, just as you are before your heart.
[842.86 --> 854.60]  Praise His rising
[854.60 --> 860.04]  Eyes are turning to You
[860.04 --> 863.86]  We turn to You
[863.86 --> 869.60]  Hope is stirring
[869.60 --> 874.76]  Hearts are yearning for You
[874.76 --> 879.04]  We long for You
[879.04 --> 882.42]  Cause when we see You
[882.42 --> 886.22]  We find strength to face the day
[886.22 --> 889.58]  In Your presence
[889.58 --> 893.34]  All our fears are washed away
[893.34 --> 896.22]  Washed away
[896.22 --> 900.38]  Hosanna
[900.38 --> 903.88]  Hosanna
[903.88 --> 908.22]  You are the God who saves us
[908.22 --> 911.48]  Worthy of all our praises
[911.48 --> 915.26]  Hosanna
[915.26 --> 919.42]  Hosanna
[919.42 --> 922.92]  Come have Your way among us
[922.92 --> 927.42]  We welcome You here Lord Jesus
[927.42 --> 938.70]  Hear the sound of hearts returning to You
[938.70 --> 941.86]  We turn to You
[941.86 --> 947.76]  In Your kingdom
[947.76 --> 949.60]  Broken
[949.60 --> 952.86]  Your lives are made new
[952.86 --> 956.74]  You make us new
[956.74 --> 960.36]  Cause when we see You
[960.36 --> 964.06]  We find strength to face the day
[964.06 --> 968.22]  Hosanna
[968.22 --> 969.22]  In Your presence
[969.22 --> 971.22]  All our fears are washed away
[971.22 --> 973.22]  Washed away
[973.22 --> 978.22]  Hosanna
[978.22 --> 979.22]  Hosanna
[979.22 --> 985.22]  You are the God who saves us
[985.22 --> 988.38]  Worthy of all our praises
[988.38 --> 990.38]  Hosanna
[990.38 --> 992.38]  Hosanna
[992.38 --> 993.38]  Hosanna
[993.38 --> 994.38]  Hosanna
[994.38 --> 996.38]  Come have Your way among us
[996.38 --> 998.38]  We welcome You here Lord Jesus
[998.38 --> 1000.38]  Hosanna
[1000.38 --> 1002.38]  Hosanna
[1002.38 --> 1007.54]  Hosanna
[1007.54 --> 1011.54]  Hosanna
[1011.54 --> 1013.54]  You are the God who saves us
[1013.54 --> 1014.58]  Hosanna
[1014.58 --> 1016.54]  Hosanna
[1016.54 --> 1018.54]  You are the God who saves us
[1018.54 --> 1019.54]  Worthy of all our praises
[1019.54 --> 1021.54]  Hosanna
[1021.54 --> 1021.92]  Hosanna
[1021.92 --> 1022.04]  Hosanna
[1022.04 --> 1023.04]  Hosanna
[1023.04 --> 1024.38]  Come have Your way among us
[1024.38 --> 1026.54]  Hosanna
[1026.54 --> 1027.54]  Hosanna
[1027.54 --> 1028.54]  Hosanna
[1028.54 --> 1029.54]  Hosanna
[1029.54 --> 1030.04]  Hosanna
[1030.04 --> 1030.54]  Hosanna
[1030.54 --> 1034.40]  We welcome you here, Lord Jesus.
[1045.98 --> 1048.68]  We raise our praises to you, Lord Jesus.
[1049.14 --> 1051.80]  Hosanna, Hosanna to our God and King.
[1052.60 --> 1056.20]  We confess that our praise of your majesty has often been faint.
[1056.20 --> 1066.16]  You walked this earth, made your dwelling among us, and yet we fail to recognize you and offer honor and glory for the sacrifice of your body.
[1066.88 --> 1073.54]  For our eyes have wandered from you, and we have surrendered to the enemy by our known and our secret sins.
[1074.42 --> 1076.72]  For our treason you died, Lord Jesus.
[1077.48 --> 1079.42]  For our restoration you rose again.
[1079.42 --> 1087.78]  Draw us closer to you in this holy week, that our eyes may catch the vision of your tears, and our hearts the wonder of your grace.
[1088.58 --> 1093.92]  By the Holy Spirit's continuing discipline, let us be loyal and loving servants of the King.
[1094.86 --> 1097.90]  In the face of fear, may we still sing Hosanna.
[1098.34 --> 1101.78]  In the face of uncertainty, may we praise your name.
[1102.38 --> 1107.20]  May our eyes be fixed on you, that we may praise you and declare it is well.
[1107.20 --> 1107.28]  Amen.
[1109.42 --> 1110.42]  Amen.
[1110.42 --> 1111.42]  Amen.
[1139.42 --> 1142.62]  Amen.
[1144.20 --> 1158.64]  Amen.
[1169.42 --> 1178.86]  And through it all, through it all, my eyes are on you
[1178.86 --> 1185.82]  Through it all, through it all, it is well
[1185.82 --> 1195.10]  Through it all, through it all, my eyes are on you
[1195.10 --> 1197.78]  And it is well
[1197.78 --> 1201.78]  With me
[1201.78 --> 1217.62]  Far be it from me to not believe
[1217.62 --> 1224.72]  Even when my eyes can't see
[1224.72 --> 1231.72]  And this mountain that's in front of me
[1231.72 --> 1238.72]  Will be thrown into the midst of the sea
[1238.72 --> 1247.72]  Through it all, through it all, my eyes are on you
[1247.72 --> 1254.72]  Through it all, through it all, it is well
[1254.72 --> 1261.72]  Through it all, through it all, my eyes are on you
[1261.72 --> 1268.72]  It is well, it is well
[1268.72 --> 1275.72]  So let go my soul and trust in Him
[1275.72 --> 1282.72]  The waves and winds still know His name
[1282.72 --> 1297.72]  So let go my soul and trust in Him
[1297.72 --> 1304.72]  The waves and winds still know His name
[1304.72 --> 1308.72]  So let go my soul and trust in Him
[1308.72 --> 1312.72]  The waves and winds still know His name
[1312.72 --> 1319.72]  The waves and winds still know His name
[1319.72 --> 1323.72]  The waves and winds still know His name
[1323.72 --> 1330.72]  It is well
[1330.72 --> 1332.72]  It is well
[1332.72 --> 1336.72]  With my soul
[1336.72 --> 1337.72]  With my soul
[1337.72 --> 1343.72]  With my soul
[1343.72 --> 1344.72]  It is well
[1344.72 --> 1346.72]  It is well
[1346.72 --> 1350.72]  With my soul
[1350.72 --> 1351.72]  It is well
[1351.72 --> 1357.72]  With my soul
[1357.72 --> 1358.72]  It is well
[1358.72 --> 1359.72]  It is well
[1359.72 --> 1364.72]  It is well
[1364.72 --> 1365.72]  With my soul
[1365.72 --> 1366.72]  It is well
[1366.72 --> 1371.72]  With my soul
[1371.72 --> 1375.72]  It is well
[1375.72 --> 1377.72]  It is well
[1377.72 --> 1379.72]  It is well
[1379.72 --> 1384.72]  With my soul
[1384.72 --> 1385.72]  With my soul
[1385.72 --> 1404.72]  It is well
[1404.72 --> 1406.72]  With my soul
[1406.72 --> 1412.72]  It is well
[1412.72 --> 1417.72]  With my soul
[1419.72 --> 1425.72]  It is well
[1426.72 --> 1432.72]  With my soul
[1433.72 --> 1437.72]  It is well
[1437.72 --> 1440.72]  It is well
[1441.72 --> 1445.72]  With my soul
[1448.72 --> 1451.72]  It is well
[1452.72 --> 1455.72]  It is well
[1456.72 --> 1459.72]  With my soul
[1459.72 --> 1466.72]  It is well
[1467.72 --> 1470.72]  It is well
[1471.72 --> 1474.72]  With my soul
[1474.72 --> 1481.72]  Through it all
[1482.72 --> 1483.72]  Through it all
[1484.72 --> 1486.72]  My eyes are on you
[1487.72 --> 1489.72]  Through it all
[1490.72 --> 1491.72]  Through it all
[1492.72 --> 1493.72]  It is well
[1494.72 --> 1497.72]  Through it all
[1498.72 --> 1499.72]  Through it all
[1499.72 --> 1502.72]  My eyes are on you
[1503.72 --> 1505.72]  And it is well
[1506.72 --> 1508.72]  With me
[1508.72 --> 1510.72]  With me
[1538.72 --> 1543.72]  I see the King of glory
[1544.72 --> 1549.72]  Coming on the clouds with fire
[1550.72 --> 1552.72]  The whole earth shakes
[1553.72 --> 1556.72]  The whole earth shakes
[1557.72 --> 1561.72]  I see His love and mercy
[1562.72 --> 1567.72]  Washing over all our sin
[1568.72 --> 1570.72]  The people sing
[1571.72 --> 1574.72]  The people sing
[1575.72 --> 1577.72]  Hosanna
[1578.72 --> 1579.72]  Hosanna
[1580.72 --> 1581.72]  Hosanna
[1582.72 --> 1585.72]  Hosanna in the highest
[1587.72 --> 1589.72]  Hosanna
[1590.72 --> 1591.72]  Hosanna
[1592.72 --> 1593.72]  Hosanna
[1593.72 --> 1595.72]  Hosanna
[1595.72 --> 1596.72]  Hosanna in the highest
[1596.72 --> 1597.72]  Hosanna in the highest
[1600.72 --> 1602.72]  I see a generation
[1603.72 --> 1606.72]  I see a generation
[1607.72 --> 1611.72]  Rising up to take their place
[1612.72 --> 1614.72]  With selfless faith
[1615.72 --> 1616.72]  With selfless faith
[1617.72 --> 1618.72]  With selfless faith
[1618.72 --> 1620.72]  I see a near revival
[1620.72 --> 1621.72]  I see a near revival
[1622.72 --> 1624.72]  I see a near revival
[1625.72 --> 1628.72]  Stirring as we pray and sing
[1629.72 --> 1630.72]  We're on our knees
[1631.72 --> 1632.72]  We're on our knees
[1633.72 --> 1634.72]  We're on our knees
[1635.72 --> 1636.72]  Hosanna
[1637.72 --> 1638.72]  Hosanna
[1639.72 --> 1640.72]  Hosanna
[1640.72 --> 1642.72]  Hosanna
[1643.72 --> 1644.72]  Hosanna
[1644.72 --> 1645.72]  Hosanna
[1646.72 --> 1647.72]  Hosanna
[1647.72 --> 1648.72]  Hosanna in the highest
[1648.72 --> 1649.72]  Hosanna
[1650.72 --> 1652.72]  Hosanna
[1663.72 --> 1664.72]  Hosanna
[1665.72 --> 1666.72]  Hosanna
[1666.72 --> 1671.40]  Heal my heart and make it clean.
[1673.06 --> 1678.16]  Open up my eyes to the things unseen.
[1679.54 --> 1686.48]  Show me how to love like you have loved me.
[1686.48 --> 1697.48]  And break my heart for what breaks yours.
[1697.84 --> 1703.72]  Everything I am for your kingdom's cause.
[1704.20 --> 1710.18]  As I walk from earth into eternity.
[1710.18 --> 1726.18]  Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest.
[1726.18 --> 1738.50]  Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest.
[1740.50 --> 1750.18]  Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest.
[1750.18 --> 1762.82]  Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest.
[1764.96 --> 1769.70]  Hosanna in the highest.
[1775.70 --> 1777.58]  Make me seated.
[1780.18 --> 1782.26]  Hosanna in the highest.
[1795.26 --> 1796.28]  Good morning.
[1796.80 --> 1801.44]  We continue to worship our God with the giving of our gifts.
[1802.60 --> 1808.08]  For the budget, which is the administration of the church and its ministries.
[1808.08 --> 1814.20]  And the special offering, which is for the Langley Manual Refugee Committee.
[1814.62 --> 1821.24]  And I'm going to get Peter Van Heusen to give us an update on the committee's work.
[1821.50 --> 1822.94]  Thank you, Emo, for sure.
[1824.08 --> 1827.20]  Buenos Dios, Congregación.
[1827.20 --> 1833.88]  Today, saludos de Sebastián Sandi, Sarah and baby Giulietto.
[1833.88 --> 1845.08]  So, yeah, Jackie and I are enjoying having the family over as Pearl and John take a break in Kelowna.
[1845.14 --> 1847.64]  They're not here this morning, so we've had them for three or four days.
[1847.72 --> 1849.64]  What a delightful family they are.
[1850.16 --> 1851.42]  And we're really enjoying them.
[1851.42 --> 1856.56]  So, today, our collection is not specific to this family.
[1856.96 --> 1867.78]  We have, as you've known, if you've been following in the bulletin, we have made a connection with the Nehmer family, which are in Lebanon, a Syrian family.
[1867.78 --> 1875.94]  By way of the Willoughby CRC, they've all of a sudden had some success in getting applicants coming.
[1876.50 --> 1880.82]  So, now we've taken that on through World Renew, and we'll be keeping you posted.
[1880.98 --> 1883.88]  And I'll have more to say about that at the congregational meeting.
[1884.54 --> 1888.56]  But it's important for us to build up the account.
[1888.68 --> 1891.00]  We currently have about $10,000 in there.
[1891.66 --> 1894.94]  And there's new requirements now by the government.
[1894.94 --> 1900.02]  We have to have the money in the account just prior to the arrival of the family coming.
[1900.18 --> 1905.40]  That's sort of the final thing, because I think some people have been reneging on that part of the responsibility.
[1906.56 --> 1920.82]  So, if we anticipate maybe in two years the family is coming, and with all the stress and strain that our governments are facing nowadays with refugees and the like, it's a huge challenge.
[1920.82 --> 1925.10]  So, yeah, we're looking eventually for having $40,000 in the account.
[1925.28 --> 1928.70]  So, give as the Lord has given you generously as we hear each Sunday.
[1929.02 --> 1933.52]  This church has been absolutely amazing at receiving the refugee family.
[1933.70 --> 1939.06]  Nashwan and Fadja's family, the Murads, are currently in their church.
[1939.12 --> 1942.18]  Even last Sunday they were leading in their church worship.
[1942.70 --> 1945.46]  So, we see so many blessings to this ministry.
[1946.04 --> 1947.16]  Thank you very much.
[1947.16 --> 1948.76]  Thanks, Peter.
[1950.62 --> 1954.76]  Yes, please give generously so these families will have a better tomorrow.
[1955.82 --> 1965.30]  Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.
[1965.88 --> 1967.60]  2 Corinthians 9, verse 7.
[1968.26 --> 1971.36]  Next week's offering is for the budget and edudaio.
[1971.36 --> 1991.70]  To God be the glory, great things He has done.
[1991.70 --> 2021.68]  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord.
[2021.68 --> 2028.32]  O come to the Father through Jesus' Son.
[2028.32 --> 2035.38]  And give Him all glory, great things He has done.
[2035.38 --> 2065.36]  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord.
[2065.38 --> 2070.38]  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord.
[2070.38 --> 2072.38]  Let the people rejoice.
[2072.38 --> 2079.54]  O come to the Father through Jesus' Son.
[2079.54 --> 2086.86]  And give Him all glory, great things He has done.
[2086.86 --> 2095.04]  Great things He has taught us, great things He has done.
[2095.04 --> 2101.68]  And great are rejoicing through Jesus the Son.
[2101.68 --> 2107.68]  But pure and higher and greater will be.
[2107.68 --> 2114.68]  Our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see.
[2114.68 --> 2118.68]  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord.
[2118.68 --> 2121.68]  Let the earth hear His voice.
[2121.68 --> 2125.68]  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord.
[2125.68 --> 2128.68]  Let the people rejoice.
[2128.68 --> 2135.68]  O come to the Father through Jesus' Son.
[2135.68 --> 2144.68]  And give Him all glory, great things He has done.
[2158.68 --> 2163.68]  Good morning, everyone.
[2163.68 --> 2165.68]  I got a couple hats I got to wear today.
[2165.68 --> 2169.68]  Today I'm giving you some council updates from our last meeting.
[2169.68 --> 2171.68]  And then after that I got children's worship time.
[2171.68 --> 2173.68]  So you guys just got to hang tight for a minute.
[2173.68 --> 2174.68]  Is that okay?
[2174.68 --> 2175.68]  Zoe, you okay with that?
[2175.68 --> 2176.68]  Okay.
[2176.68 --> 2181.68]  Alright, I just want to give you guys a little update on what council has been up to at our last meeting.
[2181.68 --> 2183.68]  We had a meeting a couple weeks ago.
[2183.68 --> 2189.68]  At the meeting, Tracy Van Heusen came and gave a report on a ministry.
[2189.68 --> 2191.68]  I got to put my glasses on.
[2191.68 --> 2196.68]  I was hoping I didn't have to do this.
[2196.68 --> 2203.68]  Tracy gave a report on the ministry evaluation and a structural review of our church at Emmanuel.
[2203.68 --> 2208.68]  We learned a lot from the review and from the input many of you gave for this report.
[2208.68 --> 2214.68]  We will use this information as a foundation for some strategic planning at Emmanuel.
[2214.68 --> 2221.68]  Some of the questions we will be wrestling with as council is who are we as Emmanuel and where is God working among us?
[2221.68 --> 2224.68]  Who is God calling to us?
[2224.68 --> 2227.68]  Who is God calling us to be in the future?
[2227.68 --> 2229.68]  And how are we going to get there?
[2229.68 --> 2233.68]  Stay tuned for some action items that will come from this report.
[2233.68 --> 2235.68]  Thanks Tracy for the work on this.
[2235.68 --> 2242.68]  We also had a discussion about two of our council members that have resigned in the last couple months.
[2242.68 --> 2247.68]  One resigned due to sudden work-life balance challenges that made serving on council difficult.
[2247.68 --> 2257.68]  And the other resigned over difference of opinion on the position the elders took in their statement regarding COVID protocols and the proof of vaccination.
[2257.68 --> 2265.68]  Both of these members are still active in other areas of Emmanuel church life and still appreciate being a vital part of the Emmanuel community.
[2265.68 --> 2272.68]  Since both these members terms were up this June we decided as council not to try and fill these positions for the short term.
[2272.68 --> 2281.68]  But this leads me to the discussion we had at council about new office fairs that we need for the upcoming this spring.
[2281.68 --> 2284.68]  We are in need of three new elders and two deacons.
[2284.68 --> 2290.68]  So if you know someone or you are interested please contact your elder or myself.
[2290.68 --> 2295.68]  There is nomination information on this in the e-bulletin.
[2295.68 --> 2299.68]  We also had discussion about classes since classes happened at the beginning of March.
[2299.68 --> 2304.68]  A number of us were there so we each gave a brief report on our time there at classes.
[2304.68 --> 2309.68]  And there was some discussion about some of the topics that came up at that meeting.
[2309.68 --> 2312.68]  Our Lord's Supper is next week Sunday.
[2312.68 --> 2314.68]  It's Easter weekend.
[2314.68 --> 2318.68]  We at council ask you to please prepare yourself for this time of communion.
[2318.68 --> 2323.68]  And as well speak to your children about this and share what it means to participate in Lord's Supper.
[2323.68 --> 2333.68]  And to end things off I got bribed by John in the back there with a roll of peppermints that his wife Helen is turning 70 today.
[2333.68 --> 2340.68]  So I think if you turn 70 you should be honoured in a special way so I think we could give her a round of applause for making it to 70.
[2340.68 --> 2344.68]  applause
[2344.68 --> 2348.68]  Alright that's it for me.
[2348.68 --> 2352.68]  Okay kids we can head up front for children's worship.
[2352.68 --> 2365.68]  I'm super, super fun.
[2365.68 --> 2366.68]  You are.
[2366.68 --> 2368.68]  Do you think you can move back a little bit?
[2368.68 --> 2370.68]  Alright good morning everyone.
[2370.68 --> 2371.68]  How are all the kids?
[2371.68 --> 2372.68]  Good.
[2372.68 --> 2374.68]  Do you think you can say that a little louder?
[2374.68 --> 2375.68]  How are you?
[2375.68 --> 2377.68]  Awesome.
[2377.68 --> 2379.68]  I got a question for you guys.
[2379.68 --> 2381.68]  How do you guys like spring right now?
[2381.68 --> 2383.68]  Like winter's kind of behind us like.
[2383.68 --> 2384.68]  I love it.
[2384.68 --> 2385.68]  What do you like?
[2385.68 --> 2387.68]  I get my birthday today.
[2387.68 --> 2388.68]  Your birthday's today too?
[2388.68 --> 2390.68]  I get my birthday today.
[2390.68 --> 2391.68]  I'm going here.
[2391.68 --> 2392.68]  She's got the same birthday as Helen.
[2392.68 --> 2393.68]  How old are you?
[2393.68 --> 2394.68]  I'm going to have a party.
[2394.68 --> 2395.68]  Four.
[2395.68 --> 2396.68]  I'm going to have a party.
[2396.68 --> 2397.68]  Alright.
[2397.68 --> 2398.68]  No, I'm going to have a party.
[2398.68 --> 2399.68]  Okay.
[2399.68 --> 2400.68]  We're going to get back to spring.
[2400.68 --> 2402.68]  What do you guys, I want to hear what you guys like about spring.
[2402.68 --> 2404.68]  What are some things you like about spring?
[2404.68 --> 2405.68]  Zoe.
[2405.68 --> 2406.68]  No snow.
[2406.68 --> 2407.68]  No snow.
[2407.68 --> 2408.68]  Anybody else?
[2408.68 --> 2410.68]  What do you like about spring?
[2410.68 --> 2412.68]  That it changes weather.
[2412.68 --> 2413.68]  The weather changes?
[2413.68 --> 2414.68]  Yeah.
[2414.68 --> 2415.68]  Flowers.
[2415.68 --> 2416.68]  Flowers are coming up.
[2416.68 --> 2417.68]  I like the flowers too.
[2417.68 --> 2418.68]  Flowers are good.
[2418.68 --> 2423.68]  It starts to get warmer.
[2423.68 --> 2424.68]  You could do more stuff outside.
[2424.68 --> 2426.68]  What are some things you like to do outside?
[2426.68 --> 2427.68]  Yeah.
[2427.68 --> 2432.68]  Get your pool going and go for a swim.
[2432.68 --> 2433.68]  Haley, what do you like?
[2433.68 --> 2436.68]  I like that my daddy can set up my trampoline.
[2436.68 --> 2437.68]  Trampoline time.
[2437.68 --> 2438.68]  Yeah.
[2438.68 --> 2443.68]  It gets, spring days get longer.
[2443.68 --> 2444.68]  The days get longer.
[2444.68 --> 2445.68]  Yeah.
[2445.68 --> 2446.68]  Great answer.
[2446.68 --> 2447.68]  One more.
[2447.68 --> 2448.68]  One more.
[2448.68 --> 2449.68]  Playing outside and I can play very few things.
[2449.68 --> 2453.68]  Playing outside like soccer or hide and seek or all kinds of cool stuff.
[2453.68 --> 2457.68]  I know there's some kids in this, in sports, some kids are playing lots of ball hockey.
[2457.68 --> 2458.68]  That's cool too in the spring.
[2458.68 --> 2459.68]  Okay.
[2459.68 --> 2460.68]  What else happens in spring?
[2460.68 --> 2462.68]  The spring reminds me a lot of good things too.
[2462.68 --> 2465.68]  Like who knows what's happening next weekend?
[2465.68 --> 2466.68]  What's happening next weekend?
[2466.68 --> 2467.68]  Easter Sunday.
[2467.68 --> 2468.68]  Easter Sunday.
[2468.68 --> 2469.68]  What happens on Easter Sunday?
[2469.68 --> 2470.68]  Who can give me a quick summary?
[2470.68 --> 2471.68]  Quick summary.
[2471.68 --> 2472.68]  Quick summary.
[2472.68 --> 2475.68]  Jesus dies on the cross for our sins.
[2475.68 --> 2477.68]  So that's what reminds me a bit about spring.
[2477.68 --> 2481.68]  The flowers, the longer days, the nicer weather and also Easter.
[2481.68 --> 2484.68]  So today we are going to have a conversation in the back.
[2484.68 --> 2486.68]  We're going to talk about how Jesus died on the cross.
[2486.68 --> 2488.68]  Chickens wake up.
[2488.68 --> 2489.68]  Alright.
[2489.68 --> 2494.68]  So we're going to talk about how Jesus died on the cross in the children's worship time today.
[2494.68 --> 2499.68]  So we will, why don't we have a quick prayer and then we're going to give the blessing.
[2499.68 --> 2500.68]  Okay.
[2500.68 --> 2501.68]  Let's do the prayer first.
[2501.68 --> 2503.68]  Dear God, thank you for this day.
[2503.68 --> 2505.68]  Thank you for another beautiful spring day.
[2505.68 --> 2510.68]  Thank you that we can worship you today at Emmanuel and thank you for all these children.
[2510.68 --> 2519.68]  And I pray that you will bless their time in children's worship time and that they will hear your word and learn from it and bless all the teachers too.
[2519.68 --> 2520.68]  Lord for Jesus sake.
[2520.68 --> 2521.68]  Amen.
[2521.68 --> 2522.68]  Alright.
[2522.68 --> 2523.68]  Let's give the blessing.
[2523.68 --> 2524.68]  Everyone rise.
[2524.68 --> 2525.68]  Okay.
[2525.68 --> 2526.68]  Ready?
[2526.68 --> 2527.68]  The Lord be with you.
[2527.68 --> 2528.68]  And all who will be with you.
[2528.68 --> 2529.68]  Okay.
[2529.68 --> 2530.68]  Ready?
[2530.68 --> 2531.68]  The Lord be with you.
[2531.68 --> 2532.68]  And all who will be with you.
[2532.68 --> 2558.68]  And all who will be with you.
[2558.68 --> 2559.68]  My name is Kevin Lobert.
[2559.68 --> 2565.68]  I'm the youth pastor here and it's my privilege to lead you all in today's congregational prayer.
[2565.68 --> 2573.68]  So if you all bow your heads with me, we'll pray.
[2573.68 --> 2577.68]  Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
[2577.68 --> 2581.68]  We give you praise for you are our God.
[2581.68 --> 2586.68]  As we sang this morning, Hosanna God to you be all the glory.
[2586.68 --> 2591.68]  We thank you Lord for your work in our lives and for the gift of your son.
[2591.68 --> 2598.68]  As we reflect on how he triumphantly entered as a king into Jerusalem during Holy Week on this Palm Sunday.
[2598.68 --> 2606.68]  May we remember Jesus that you are our king sovereignly reigning from your throne over your kingdom.
[2606.68 --> 2613.68]  May your kingdom come and your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[2613.68 --> 2618.68]  Lord Jesus, our world seems to be tearing apart.
[2618.68 --> 2620.68]  War is prevalent.
[2620.68 --> 2626.68]  We think especially of countries like Ukraine as they continue to resist attacks from Russia.
[2626.68 --> 2631.68]  We think of countries like Myanmar, Syria, Libya, Mali and Colombia.
[2631.68 --> 2634.68]  All of which who are going through terrible civil wars.
[2635.68 --> 2640.68]  As people are displaced in these countries, may you show them mercy.
[2640.68 --> 2645.68]  Let us, your global church, be your hands and feet for them.
[2645.68 --> 2648.68]  May your kingdom come, Lord.
[2648.68 --> 2654.68]  We think especially of the family that came through our church doors looking for asylum from Colombia.
[2654.68 --> 2667.68]  We thank you for the hospitality of those who have opened their doors for this family.
[2667.68 --> 2673.68]  May you bless our efforts as we do our best to help them.
[2673.68 --> 2688.68]  And we ask, Lord, for wisdom both for us and the Canadian government as we move forward.
[2688.68 --> 2690.68]  May we seek what is best for them.
[2690.68 --> 2693.68]  May you provide for them.
[2693.68 --> 2698.68]  Lord, be with our country who is divided on so many things.
[2698.68 --> 2703.68]  Bring understanding and empathy and cause unity, Lord.
[2703.68 --> 2705.68]  Be with our leaders as well, Father.
[2705.68 --> 2708.68]  May they seek your will as they lead.
[2708.68 --> 2715.68]  Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.
[2715.68 --> 2719.68]  We thank you for everything you have blessed us with, Lord.
[2719.68 --> 2721.68]  We have so much.
[2721.68 --> 2726.68]  And yet, Lord Jesus, even in our providence, we need so much.
[2726.68 --> 2730.68]  We think of those struggling with their physical or mental health.
[2730.68 --> 2733.68]  For those who have anxiety or depression.
[2733.68 --> 2739.68]  Those who are grieving, frustrated, confused, lonely, or afraid.
[2739.68 --> 2742.68]  Father, give all of us what we need.
[2742.68 --> 2746.68]  And may we as a church surround each other with love and understanding.
[2746.68 --> 2754.68]  Lord, we especially think this time for the university and college-aged folks in our congregation, Lord,
[2754.68 --> 2757.68]  as this semester is coming to an end.
[2757.68 --> 2762.68]  As they are neck deep in papers and preparing for exams and the end of the semester,
[2762.68 --> 2763.68]  will you be with them?
[2763.68 --> 2769.68]  Remove any fear and anxiety in their lives and allow them to finish this semester strong.
[2769.68 --> 2773.68]  Finally, Father, we ask for forgiveness.
[2773.68 --> 2776.68]  Forgiveness when we know we have sinned.
[2776.68 --> 2780.68]  Forgiveness when we don't even realize we are sinning.
[2780.68 --> 2785.68]  In our stubbornness and in our ignorance, grant us forgiveness, we pray.
[2785.68 --> 2792.68]  And Lord, if we need to forgive others, Holy Spirit, stir in our hearts right now.
[2792.68 --> 2795.68]  Show us those who need our forgiveness.
[2795.68 --> 2798.68]  Let our hearts burn for them.
[2798.68 --> 2805.68]  And let us not let our pride or anger get in the way of what you call us to do.
[2805.68 --> 2810.68]  May we forgive as you call us to forgive.
[2810.68 --> 2815.68]  And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.
[2815.68 --> 2817.68]  You are our Savior.
[2817.68 --> 2821.68]  You have given us immeasurable gifts of love and grace.
[2821.68 --> 2826.68]  You have also promised that you will always give us a way out when we are tempted to sin.
[2826.68 --> 2831.68]  May your Spirit stir in our hearts, God, and grant us understanding when we are tempted.
[2831.68 --> 2833.68]  Keep the evil one away from us.
[2833.68 --> 2838.68]  And may we remember and know that you are forever nearby when we are tempted to stray.
[2838.68 --> 2844.68]  And as we open your word here in a few moments, we pray that you will be with Pastor Chris.
[2844.68 --> 2847.68]  May he speak your words to us, not his.
[2847.68 --> 2856.68]  And may, Lord, we have open ears, soft hearts, and curious minds to engage your holy word this morning.
[2856.68 --> 2861.68]  For yours is the kingdom, the power, and the glory forever.
[2861.68 --> 2862.68]  Amen.
[2874.68 --> 2875.68]  Amen.
[2875.68 --> 2876.68]  Amen.
[2876.68 --> 2877.68]  Amen.
[2877.68 --> 2878.68]  Amen.
[2878.68 --> 2879.68]  Amen.
[2879.68 --> 2882.68]  Amen.
[2882.68 --> 2896.68]  I'm going to continue in our Palm Sunday service by reflecting on a text and a story from the
[2896.68 --> 2899.68]  Gospel of Mark that comes after Palm Sunday, actually.
[2899.68 --> 2905.94]  actually. We're going to read from Mark 14. I'm going to read verse 1 through 11. So, as always,
[2906.04 --> 2911.26]  I encourage you to have a Bible, have that open in front of you, and keep it open as we go through
[2911.26 --> 2913.90]  this time together. Let me read with you.
[2917.44 --> 2924.62]  Now, the Passover and the festival of unleavened bread were only two days away, and the chief
[2924.62 --> 2930.58]  priests and teachers of the law were scheming to arrest Jesus secretly and to kill him.
[2931.46 --> 2938.26]  But not during the festival, they said, or the people may riot. While he was in Bethany,
[2938.92 --> 2945.48]  reclining at the table in the home of Simon the leper, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very
[2945.48 --> 2953.96]  expensive perfume made of pure nard. He broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head.
[2955.58 --> 2959.42]  Some of those who were present were saying indignantly to one another,
[2960.06 --> 2964.92]  why this waste of perfume? It could have been sold for more than a year's wages,
[2965.34 --> 2969.22]  and the money given to the poor, and they rebuked her harshly.
[2971.00 --> 2979.12]  Leave her alone, Jesus said. Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing.
[2979.12 --> 2986.30]  The poor you will always have with you, and you can help them anytime you want, but you will not
[2986.30 --> 2995.26]  always have me. She did what she could. She poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial.
[2995.26 --> 3006.70]  Truly, I tell you, wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.
[3006.70 --> 3014.34]  Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Jesus to them.
[3015.14 --> 3018.62]  And they were delighted to hear this and promised to give him money,
[3018.92 --> 3023.08]  so he watched for an opportunity to hand him over.
[3023.08 --> 3025.32]  Word of the Lord.
[3025.32 --> 3036.20]  We started our worship this morning by explaining Palm Sunday,
[3036.78 --> 3041.86]  and we've worshipped for the last while with palm branches in our singing and in our praying,
[3042.10 --> 3044.04]  and with kids marching around.
[3044.92 --> 3050.78]  I imagine on that day 2,000 years ago, kids were just as unruly then as they are now,
[3050.78 --> 3055.68]  and so if that upsets you a little bit, we're just living history, friends.
[3056.58 --> 3058.20]  So let's enjoy that together.
[3061.66 --> 3065.92]  Palm Sunday announces Jesus as king.
[3066.82 --> 3069.26]  A particular kind of king, absolutely, right?
[3069.28 --> 3074.30]  A king who rides in on a donkey, a king who is heralded by praise,
[3074.54 --> 3076.76]  and I love the way Luke tells the story,
[3076.76 --> 3080.76]  that even if the people didn't praise him, the stones would have.
[3082.84 --> 3085.92]  This year, in our text for this morning,
[3086.04 --> 3091.80]  I'm going to pick up on another focus that comes on this same day in the Christian calendar.
[3091.96 --> 3094.66]  Sometimes we call that the liturgical calendar.
[3095.52 --> 3100.38]  I want to focus not on the theme of Palm Sunday and the kingship of Jesus,
[3100.52 --> 3103.06]  but on the themes of Passion Sunday.
[3103.06 --> 3108.02]  Now, that word passion here doesn't mean lots of emotion,
[3108.16 --> 3110.12]  although that's part of it, absolutely, right?
[3110.26 --> 3114.14]  Passion here in this context of the liturgical calendar,
[3114.28 --> 3115.48]  the movements of the church,
[3115.82 --> 3120.76]  refers to the love of Jesus for his people that led him to the cross.
[3121.82 --> 3125.78]  The love of Jesus that caused him to endure all that suffering
[3125.78 --> 3128.70]  in the last week of his life, but even before.
[3128.70 --> 3137.96]  Now, the story that we read here in Mark 14 happens a couple days after the events of the palms
[3137.96 --> 3140.18]  and Jesus entering to Jerusalem.
[3140.36 --> 3143.80]  And so, to superimpose this text over our calendar,
[3143.94 --> 3146.24]  or to impose our calendar over this text,
[3146.54 --> 3150.92]  that means this is probably a Tuesday night or a Wednesday afternoon kind of event.
[3150.92 --> 3154.92]  Now, I say that here by way of introduction
[3154.92 --> 3161.44]  because sometimes it's easy for us to forget that this actually happened,
[3161.98 --> 3165.24]  that this story is history.
[3166.40 --> 3169.22]  One of the amazing things about Christianity,
[3169.66 --> 3172.94]  or part of what makes Christianity amazing and unique,
[3173.12 --> 3176.54]  is that it's based on and in history.
[3176.54 --> 3180.88]  These aren't just stories or myths made up to understand the world.
[3181.22 --> 3183.86]  We understand the world by these stories and myths
[3183.86 --> 3187.98]  because they happened in the world around us.
[3188.78 --> 3192.06]  God really did create the world according to his word,
[3192.16 --> 3196.42]  and he really did promise to enter into his creation.
[3196.74 --> 3199.82]  Jesus really is the son of God who took on flesh
[3199.82 --> 3204.46]  and became a man like us in every way except without sin.
[3204.46 --> 3207.54]  This is a true story.
[3208.74 --> 3209.86]  Let me be clear.
[3210.00 --> 3215.02]  Not just my truth, but history truth.
[3215.54 --> 3217.06]  It actually happened.
[3217.24 --> 3221.34]  And so, given that, given that it actually happened,
[3221.48 --> 3226.96]  it only makes sense that this story has an effect on the present.
[3228.16 --> 3232.74]  The past, by definition, brings about the present.
[3232.74 --> 3240.10]  And so, Jesus' actions in the past will bring about our reality in the present.
[3240.54 --> 3241.94]  Now, I'm a student of history.
[3242.26 --> 3243.76]  That's just how history works.
[3244.00 --> 3247.06]  But that might seem like a silly thing to say,
[3247.22 --> 3250.10]  but in our age of expressive individualism,
[3250.20 --> 3251.52]  or perspectival realism,
[3251.76 --> 3254.36]  or absolute relativity, post-modernity,
[3254.42 --> 3255.40]  whatever you want to call it,
[3255.66 --> 3258.30]  it actually doesn't seem like that's a logical thing to say anymore.
[3258.30 --> 3264.30]  But, here's why I think this text,
[3264.50 --> 3266.06]  this actual history,
[3266.26 --> 3269.76]  this real story matters today.
[3271.44 --> 3273.52]  You see, in this story,
[3274.18 --> 3278.64]  is that the supreme value of Jesus
[3278.64 --> 3286.70]  far outweighs all other things of worth in this life.
[3286.70 --> 3293.12]  The supreme value of Jesus far outweighs all other things of worth in this life.
[3293.54 --> 3294.04]  That's it.
[3294.60 --> 3297.10]  That's the point of this story.
[3300.22 --> 3304.20]  Now, before we get into that,
[3304.28 --> 3307.46]  let me anticipate a couple of your objections.
[3308.68 --> 3310.80]  Now, first, some of you might say,
[3310.80 --> 3312.70]  well, of course he thinks that.
[3312.76 --> 3313.50]  He's the pastor.
[3314.24 --> 3315.64]  He has to think that.
[3315.88 --> 3318.08]  He's dedicated his life to that truth.
[3318.18 --> 3319.68]  And so, he needs it to be true.
[3320.82 --> 3321.92]  And in a sense, you're right.
[3322.12 --> 3323.76]  I do need it to be true.
[3324.50 --> 3327.18]  But not because I've dedicated my life to it.
[3327.98 --> 3329.72]  I don't need this to be true
[3329.72 --> 3331.68]  for my power, or my privilege,
[3331.80 --> 3333.18]  or for my station in life.
[3333.38 --> 3334.78]  I need this to be true
[3334.78 --> 3336.98]  because we all need this to be true.
[3336.98 --> 3340.56]  I'll come back to that at the end.
[3341.48 --> 3344.30]  But let me anticipate also a second objection.
[3345.82 --> 3347.30]  You might say something like,
[3347.36 --> 3349.22]  or someone might say to you one day,
[3349.74 --> 3352.94]  sure, you can say that this is true for you,
[3353.08 --> 3355.10]  and maybe it is for you.
[3355.80 --> 3358.90]  You can even say that it's true for all Christians,
[3359.38 --> 3361.58]  right, people who have chosen to believe in the Bible
[3361.58 --> 3363.32]  and what it says about God and stuff.
[3363.56 --> 3365.98]  But you can't say it's true for everyone.
[3365.98 --> 3369.20]  You can't say that Jesus has supreme value for everyone
[3369.20 --> 3371.34]  because that's just a little bit arrogant
[3371.34 --> 3373.92]  and probably also a little bit ignorant
[3373.92 --> 3375.92]  because there's so many people who don't know Jesus
[3375.92 --> 3378.08]  and he can't be the most valuable thing to them
[3378.08 --> 3379.12]  because they don't know him.
[3382.10 --> 3383.42]  That's a great objection.
[3384.38 --> 3387.24]  I say great because I love that conversation.
[3388.64 --> 3390.82]  I'm going to poke at this one a little bit more
[3390.82 --> 3393.32]  throughout our time together.
[3393.32 --> 3395.90]  And so, keeping those objections in your mind,
[3396.76 --> 3399.08]  let me remind you of what we're looking at, right?
[3399.14 --> 3401.84]  The supreme value of Jesus far outweighs
[3401.84 --> 3406.12]  all other things of worth in this life.
[3406.76 --> 3408.12]  And so, under that banner,
[3408.42 --> 3411.90]  let's look again at the story to see how we get there.
[3412.34 --> 3415.60]  First, notice what we read in the first verse.
[3415.60 --> 3418.24]  Now, the Passover and the festival of unleavened bread
[3418.24 --> 3421.88]  were only two days away.
[3421.88 --> 3424.36]  Jump down to verse 3.
[3424.52 --> 3427.68]  Well, he, Jesus, was in Bethany.
[3428.74 --> 3431.58]  He was in the home of Simon the leper.
[3432.68 --> 3434.98]  And then, near the end, verse 10,
[3435.34 --> 3437.70]  then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve.
[3438.62 --> 3439.62]  Now, why do I point these out?
[3439.68 --> 3440.66]  Why do I think this is important?
[3440.66 --> 3444.62]  These, what we just looked at here,
[3444.94 --> 3448.12]  are all markers of specificity.
[3449.46 --> 3449.70]  Right?
[3450.20 --> 3452.84]  They specify a certain time,
[3453.32 --> 3454.62]  two days before the Passover.
[3454.62 --> 3457.96]  It's a specificity of place.
[3458.36 --> 3459.72]  He was eating in Bethany.
[3460.34 --> 3463.34]  And there's a specificity of the people involved.
[3463.70 --> 3463.84]  Right?
[3463.96 --> 3466.08]  Simon the leper and Judas Iscariot.
[3466.40 --> 3471.36]  And piling on all these specific and particular details
[3471.36 --> 3473.74]  is a way that Mark says to us,
[3473.90 --> 3474.90]  this is real.
[3475.42 --> 3476.70]  This really happened.
[3476.90 --> 3479.14]  There are really people that you can check up
[3479.14 --> 3481.10]  in this story with.
[3481.68 --> 3481.78]  Right?
[3482.54 --> 3484.50]  Specificity is a witness
[3484.50 --> 3487.84]  to the historical truth of this story.
[3490.62 --> 3493.06]  Bethany is a town
[3493.06 --> 3495.62]  just a short journey away from Jerusalem.
[3495.62 --> 3497.14]  It's like a bedroom community
[3497.14 --> 3499.52]  on the other side of the Mount of Olives.
[3500.30 --> 3501.60]  And there, in Bethany,
[3501.78 --> 3504.12]  is the home of Simon the leper.
[3505.06 --> 3507.62]  Now, Simon is a really common name
[3507.62 --> 3511.66]  in the Second Temple Jewish era and time
[3511.66 --> 3512.92]  that this was written.
[3513.18 --> 3517.44]  And so, the epithet or the sobriquet,
[3517.66 --> 3520.30]  the nickname Simon the leper,
[3520.88 --> 3521.48]  is added.
[3522.26 --> 3523.14]  Now, leprosy,
[3524.08 --> 3525.12]  for those of you who don't know,
[3525.20 --> 3527.88]  is a bacterial infection of the skin
[3527.88 --> 3530.08]  and the flesh that causes sores
[3530.08 --> 3531.32]  and severe rashes
[3531.32 --> 3532.76]  and even nerve damage.
[3534.10 --> 3535.76]  And for most ancient people,
[3535.76 --> 3538.44]  even actually in some parts
[3538.44 --> 3539.34]  of the world today,
[3539.74 --> 3541.00]  if you have leprosy,
[3541.12 --> 3543.48]  you are marked out as unclean
[3543.48 --> 3545.80]  and you had to live outside
[3545.80 --> 3546.74]  of the community.
[3546.98 --> 3548.60]  You had to go to a special camp
[3548.60 --> 3550.04]  that was outside
[3550.04 --> 3551.58]  and you could belong there
[3551.58 --> 3553.04]  in the colony of lepers.
[3553.88 --> 3554.96]  This is also true
[3554.96 --> 3556.08]  and explicitly so
[3556.08 --> 3557.40]  for Jewish people.
[3557.58 --> 3558.34]  Leviticus 13
[3558.34 --> 3559.94]  has a whole chapter of rules
[3559.94 --> 3560.64]  about what to do
[3560.64 --> 3561.30]  with people with
[3561.30 --> 3562.70]  this kind of disease.
[3562.70 --> 3565.84]  Now, what that means, right,
[3565.90 --> 3567.38]  for us in understanding this story
[3567.38 --> 3568.26]  is that Simon
[3568.26 --> 3570.86]  probably had leprosy
[3570.86 --> 3572.04]  at some point.
[3572.36 --> 3574.16]  Notice the past tense there, right?
[3574.34 --> 3575.88]  Because he is able currently
[3575.88 --> 3577.10]  to host a group of people
[3577.10 --> 3577.78]  in his house.
[3578.72 --> 3580.42]  Maybe even some of the Pharisees
[3580.42 --> 3581.42]  and the chief priests
[3581.42 --> 3582.28]  and temple officials,
[3582.66 --> 3583.42]  the people who would be
[3583.42 --> 3584.24]  really concerned
[3584.24 --> 3585.04]  about whether or not
[3585.04 --> 3587.08]  they are ceremoniously unclean.
[3588.06 --> 3589.84]  And so, what that means is, right,
[3589.84 --> 3592.16]  that Simon has probably been cured
[3592.16 --> 3593.50]  by this point.
[3594.28 --> 3597.40]  Maybe even cured by Jesus.
[3598.20 --> 3598.72]  Maybe.
[3600.44 --> 3603.90]  But that he had leprosy
[3603.90 --> 3605.32]  is a marker
[3605.32 --> 3608.14]  of his specific identity.
[3608.42 --> 3609.56]  He is signaled out
[3609.56 --> 3610.68]  by this history.
[3611.10 --> 3611.90]  And the point here
[3611.90 --> 3612.62]  is that a man
[3612.62 --> 3614.94]  who is wealthy enough
[3614.94 --> 3616.50]  to have a home large enough
[3616.50 --> 3617.92]  to host a group of people
[3617.92 --> 3618.86]  of this size,
[3619.26 --> 3621.38]  who is connected enough
[3621.38 --> 3622.66]  to know Jesus
[3622.66 --> 3624.04]  and the chief priests
[3624.04 --> 3624.76]  and officials,
[3625.36 --> 3626.74]  and who had leprosy
[3626.74 --> 3627.68]  but has been healed,
[3628.18 --> 3629.24]  that kind of man
[3629.24 --> 3630.10]  would be known
[3630.10 --> 3630.90]  and remembered.
[3634.16 --> 3634.68]  Again,
[3635.42 --> 3636.92]  all these markers
[3636.92 --> 3638.92]  of specificity
[3638.92 --> 3639.74]  tell us
[3639.74 --> 3640.84]  that this story
[3640.84 --> 3642.42]  really happened.
[3642.90 --> 3643.68]  And it's actually
[3643.68 --> 3645.12]  a way of Mark saying,
[3645.54 --> 3647.10]  I dare you to fact check me.
[3648.70 --> 3649.18]  Right?
[3649.28 --> 3650.20]  Go check and talk
[3650.20 --> 3650.70]  to these people.
[3650.76 --> 3651.44]  You know who they are.
[3653.50 --> 3654.76]  And if these markers
[3654.76 --> 3655.98]  of specificity
[3655.98 --> 3656.92]  tell us
[3656.92 --> 3657.52]  that the story
[3657.52 --> 3658.56]  really happened,
[3658.82 --> 3659.06]  that is,
[3659.14 --> 3660.62]  if this part is real,
[3661.54 --> 3662.86]  then the second part
[3662.86 --> 3664.00]  is real.
[3664.06 --> 3665.20]  And if the whole story
[3665.20 --> 3665.90]  is true,
[3666.22 --> 3666.90]  then the point
[3666.90 --> 3667.92]  that Jesus makes,
[3668.04 --> 3669.30]  the point that Mark
[3669.30 --> 3669.98]  is making
[3669.98 --> 3671.22]  in recording this story
[3671.22 --> 3672.04]  in this way
[3672.04 --> 3673.46]  must also
[3673.46 --> 3674.80]  be true.
[3674.80 --> 3679.60]  So look at the second half
[3679.60 --> 3679.88]  then,
[3680.32 --> 3680.86]  verse 3.
[3682.98 --> 3683.78]  A woman came
[3683.78 --> 3685.16]  with an alabaster jar
[3685.16 --> 3686.68]  of very expensive perfume
[3686.68 --> 3689.02]  made of pure nard.
[3690.04 --> 3690.98]  She broke the jar
[3690.98 --> 3692.54]  and poured the perfume
[3692.54 --> 3694.14]  on his head.
[3696.38 --> 3696.96]  Now, first,
[3697.96 --> 3698.78]  comment about the
[3698.78 --> 3700.78]  jar of perfume.
[3700.78 --> 3703.16]  Mark tells us
[3703.16 --> 3705.30]  that the alabaster jar
[3705.30 --> 3707.46]  of very expensive perfume
[3707.46 --> 3708.90]  is worth more
[3708.90 --> 3710.34]  than a year's wages.
[3711.14 --> 3712.90]  There's a parallel story
[3712.90 --> 3714.48]  to this one
[3714.48 --> 3715.70]  told in John's Gospel
[3715.70 --> 3717.12]  that says that the jar
[3717.12 --> 3718.24]  was a pint jar.
[3718.82 --> 3719.64]  So you all know
[3719.64 --> 3720.72]  how big a pint is,
[3720.78 --> 3720.98]  right?
[3720.98 --> 3723.74]  If you don't,
[3723.80 --> 3724.22]  talk to me.
[3724.28 --> 3725.08]  We'll grab one this week
[3725.08 --> 3725.60]  and I'll show you.
[3726.90 --> 3728.18]  We know how big a pint is.
[3728.22 --> 3729.34]  So it's a relatively
[3729.34 --> 3730.24]  large jar
[3730.24 --> 3731.22]  but not incredibly,
[3731.38 --> 3732.24]  like it's not a barrel,
[3733.06 --> 3733.26]  right?
[3733.28 --> 3734.12]  This is expensive
[3734.12 --> 3735.40]  stuff.
[3735.82 --> 3736.54]  The Greek text,
[3736.72 --> 3736.92]  actually,
[3737.02 --> 3737.66]  this story,
[3737.88 --> 3738.88]  the whole New Testament
[3738.88 --> 3739.24]  really,
[3739.48 --> 3740.42]  was originally written
[3740.42 --> 3740.92]  in Greek
[3740.92 --> 3742.66]  and it says there
[3742.66 --> 3743.38]  that it was worth
[3743.38 --> 3744.78]  300 denarii.
[3745.60 --> 3745.78]  Now,
[3745.84 --> 3747.02]  a single denarii
[3747.02 --> 3748.62]  is a day's wage.
[3749.58 --> 3750.06]  And so,
[3750.58 --> 3752.40]  300 working days
[3752.40 --> 3752.96]  in a year,
[3753.12 --> 3753.40]  roughly,
[3753.84 --> 3755.00]  in the ancient world.
[3755.26 --> 3756.28]  Extrapolate that out.
[3756.62 --> 3757.34]  What we get here
[3757.34 --> 3758.00]  is more than
[3758.00 --> 3759.26]  a year's wages.
[3759.72 --> 3759.88]  Now,
[3759.94 --> 3760.22]  let me
[3760.22 --> 3762.28]  modernize that,
[3763.38 --> 3763.64]  right?
[3763.74 --> 3765.38]  And this is an analogy
[3765.38 --> 3766.46]  so I know analogies
[3766.46 --> 3767.02]  all break down
[3767.02 --> 3767.64]  at some point
[3767.64 --> 3768.68]  but let me
[3768.68 --> 3769.64]  modernize that for us.
[3769.74 --> 3771.22]  Even conservatively,
[3771.82 --> 3773.80]  let's assume
[3773.80 --> 3775.74]  a living wage
[3775.74 --> 3776.66]  for the greater
[3776.66 --> 3777.52]  Vancouver area
[3777.52 --> 3778.30]  of approximately
[3778.30 --> 3779.60]  $22 an hour.
[3780.64 --> 3781.72]  Working eight hours
[3781.72 --> 3782.18]  a day
[3782.18 --> 3783.78]  for 300 days.
[3784.44 --> 3785.58]  That comes out
[3785.58 --> 3787.00]  to $52,000
[3787.00 --> 3789.02]  or $52,800.
[3790.60 --> 3791.54]  But remember,
[3792.20 --> 3793.70]  this is a super luxury item
[3793.70 --> 3794.70]  and so maybe
[3794.70 --> 3795.80]  it's worth comparing
[3795.80 --> 3796.58]  to more than
[3796.58 --> 3798.12]  a minimal yearly salary.
[3798.88 --> 3799.24]  We don't know
[3799.24 --> 3800.26]  the price details
[3800.26 --> 3801.38]  but the parallel
[3801.38 --> 3801.90]  that I'm trying
[3801.90 --> 3802.56]  to make is here
[3802.56 --> 3803.54]  is that this isn't
[3803.54 --> 3804.58]  a little jar of perfume
[3804.58 --> 3805.04]  that you buy
[3805.04 --> 3805.74]  for Mother's Day.
[3806.02 --> 3807.18]  This is your new truck.
[3808.30 --> 3810.24]  Right?
[3810.28 --> 3810.78]  This isn't that
[3810.78 --> 3811.46]  bottle of cologne
[3811.46 --> 3811.98]  that you bought
[3811.98 --> 3812.38]  your dad
[3812.38 --> 3812.98]  that he still
[3812.98 --> 3813.94]  keeps in the closet
[3813.94 --> 3814.78]  and hasn't looked at.
[3814.94 --> 3816.10]  This is your new Tesla.
[3818.98 --> 3819.98]  All of that
[3819.98 --> 3821.04]  value
[3821.04 --> 3823.72]  for one
[3823.72 --> 3825.06]  moment
[3825.06 --> 3826.52]  of worship.
[3826.52 --> 3831.00]  Now,
[3831.00 --> 3833.86]  hang on to that idea
[3833.86 --> 3834.38]  for a moment
[3834.38 --> 3836.26]  and hold it
[3836.26 --> 3837.10]  here
[3837.10 --> 3838.20]  because there's
[3838.20 --> 3838.82]  one more thing
[3838.82 --> 3839.78]  that we need to see
[3839.78 --> 3840.74]  before we turn
[3840.74 --> 3841.44]  that next corner
[3841.44 --> 3842.02]  into that.
[3843.82 --> 3844.68]  With all the
[3844.68 --> 3845.70]  specificity
[3845.70 --> 3847.00]  of this text,
[3847.80 --> 3849.44]  why is this
[3849.44 --> 3849.78]  woman
[3849.78 --> 3850.36]  unnamed?
[3850.36 --> 3853.86]  Now,
[3853.90 --> 3854.20]  let me be
[3854.20 --> 3855.04]  really clear
[3855.04 --> 3856.20]  because this
[3856.20 --> 3856.76]  is a debated
[3856.76 --> 3857.24]  thing.
[3858.24 --> 3859.16]  I don't believe
[3859.16 --> 3859.82]  that this woman
[3859.82 --> 3860.68]  is unnamed
[3860.68 --> 3862.54]  not because
[3862.54 --> 3863.60]  she is a woman
[3863.60 --> 3865.36]  and not because
[3865.36 --> 3866.14]  that this is
[3866.14 --> 3868.14]  a patriarchal text
[3868.14 --> 3869.16]  in a patriarchal
[3869.16 --> 3869.84]  culture
[3869.84 --> 3870.38]  even though there
[3870.38 --> 3871.06]  are lots of people
[3871.06 --> 3871.54]  who say that
[3871.54 --> 3872.12]  that's the reason
[3872.12 --> 3872.44]  why.
[3873.20 --> 3873.96]  The reason I don't
[3873.96 --> 3874.62]  think that is the
[3874.62 --> 3875.22]  case here
[3875.22 --> 3876.46]  is because
[3876.46 --> 3877.14]  all throughout
[3877.14 --> 3877.84]  the Gospels
[3877.84 --> 3878.62]  there are women
[3878.62 --> 3879.56]  who are mentioned
[3879.56 --> 3880.34]  by name
[3880.34 --> 3881.22]  in support of
[3881.22 --> 3882.04]  Jesus and who
[3882.04 --> 3882.98]  function alongside
[3882.98 --> 3883.84]  of the disciples
[3883.84 --> 3884.98]  as missionaries
[3884.98 --> 3885.38]  with him.
[3885.68 --> 3886.36]  We hear story
[3886.36 --> 3886.80]  after story
[3886.80 --> 3887.46]  of Mary and
[3887.46 --> 3887.78]  Martha,
[3887.98 --> 3888.36]  of Joanna
[3888.36 --> 3889.00]  and Susanna,
[3889.20 --> 3890.00]  of Salome
[3890.00 --> 3890.66]  and at least
[3890.66 --> 3891.54]  two other women
[3891.54 --> 3892.22]  named Mary,
[3892.62 --> 3893.26]  three if you
[3893.26 --> 3893.70]  count Jesus'
[3893.88 --> 3894.06]  mother.
[3895.44 --> 3896.22]  And we know
[3896.22 --> 3898.30]  that she's
[3898.30 --> 3900.20]  not unnamed
[3900.20 --> 3901.06]  in this text
[3901.06 --> 3902.22]  because she's
[3902.22 --> 3903.32]  not worth less
[3903.32 --> 3904.76]  than the others
[3904.76 --> 3906.06]  by the very fact
[3906.06 --> 3906.66]  that Jesus
[3906.66 --> 3907.74]  praises her
[3907.74 --> 3908.28]  actions
[3908.28 --> 3909.24]  and he says
[3909.24 --> 3910.08]  that her actions
[3910.08 --> 3911.00]  are worth more
[3911.00 --> 3911.84]  than all of these
[3911.84 --> 3912.38]  other people.
[3912.60 --> 3912.94]  He says,
[3913.28 --> 3914.30]  truly I tell you
[3914.30 --> 3915.14]  wherever the gospel
[3915.14 --> 3915.68]  is preached
[3915.68 --> 3916.42]  throughout the world
[3916.42 --> 3917.56]  what she has done
[3917.56 --> 3918.74]  will also be told
[3918.74 --> 3919.64]  in memory
[3919.64 --> 3920.64]  of her.
[3921.02 --> 3922.66]  And I love
[3922.66 --> 3923.36]  that line
[3923.36 --> 3924.90]  because right now
[3924.90 --> 3925.28]  here,
[3925.48 --> 3925.82]  today,
[3926.10 --> 3927.08]  as we remember
[3927.08 --> 3927.36]  her,
[3927.46 --> 3928.12]  as we remember
[3928.12 --> 3928.54]  the beauty
[3928.54 --> 3929.24]  of her actions
[3929.24 --> 3930.14]  we are fulfilling
[3930.14 --> 3931.06]  what Jesus said.
[3933.48 --> 3934.48]  And so instead
[3934.48 --> 3936.50]  I think that
[3936.50 --> 3937.72]  she is unnamed
[3937.72 --> 3939.34]  because it
[3939.34 --> 3940.48]  increases the
[3940.48 --> 3941.18]  shame
[3941.18 --> 3942.00]  of those
[3942.00 --> 3942.72]  around her
[3942.72 --> 3943.30]  who should
[3943.30 --> 3943.78]  know better.
[3945.14 --> 3946.38]  She is a foil
[3946.38 --> 3947.66]  for pointing out
[3947.66 --> 3948.42]  the assumptions
[3948.42 --> 3949.60]  of the people
[3949.60 --> 3950.24]  in power
[3950.24 --> 3950.78]  and the people
[3950.78 --> 3951.40]  who are supposed
[3951.40 --> 3952.28]  to be in the know.
[3952.94 --> 3953.88]  She reveals
[3953.88 --> 3955.14]  that they don't know
[3955.14 --> 3956.30]  and that their status
[3956.30 --> 3957.02]  is meaningless
[3957.02 --> 3958.30]  because they missed
[3958.30 --> 3959.28]  Jesus for who
[3959.28 --> 3960.20]  he really is
[3960.20 --> 3961.06]  and what he is
[3961.06 --> 3961.64]  about to do
[3961.64 --> 3962.14]  for them
[3962.14 --> 3962.92]  and for us
[3962.92 --> 3963.18]  all.
[3964.68 --> 3965.38]  This woman
[3965.38 --> 3967.14]  presumably a poor
[3967.14 --> 3967.98]  woman based on
[3967.98 --> 3968.56]  verse 3
[3968.56 --> 3969.24]  or verse 7
[3969.24 --> 3969.96]  which Jesus says
[3969.96 --> 3970.40]  the poor you
[3970.40 --> 3970.76]  will always
[3970.76 --> 3971.32]  have with you
[3971.32 --> 3972.30]  this woman
[3972.30 --> 3973.26]  got it
[3973.26 --> 3974.48]  she figured it
[3974.48 --> 3974.76]  out
[3974.76 --> 3975.82]  before all
[3975.82 --> 3976.26]  the other
[3976.26 --> 3976.62]  women
[3976.62 --> 3977.56]  in the room
[3977.56 --> 3979.58]  and it is
[3979.58 --> 3980.44]  beautiful
[3980.44 --> 3981.44]  and Jesus
[3981.44 --> 3982.34]  says she has
[3982.34 --> 3983.54]  done a beautiful
[3983.54 --> 3984.08]  thing
[3984.08 --> 3985.14]  and she poured
[3985.14 --> 3986.20]  perfume on
[3986.20 --> 3986.76]  my body
[3986.76 --> 3987.36]  beforehand
[3987.36 --> 3988.42]  to prepare
[3988.42 --> 3989.08]  for my
[3989.08 --> 3990.12]  burial.
[3991.84 --> 3992.06]  Now
[3992.06 --> 3995.56]  let this
[3995.56 --> 3996.22]  woman's
[3996.22 --> 3997.50]  actions
[3997.50 --> 3999.22]  ask you
[3999.22 --> 3999.92]  the same
[3999.92 --> 4000.78]  question
[4000.78 --> 4001.34]  that they
[4001.34 --> 4002.02]  asked in
[4002.02 --> 4002.56]  that room
[4002.56 --> 4003.44]  in that moment
[4003.44 --> 4003.64]  right?
[4003.76 --> 4004.38]  Unpark that
[4004.38 --> 4004.90]  idea that we
[4004.90 --> 4005.28]  just pulled
[4005.28 --> 4005.44]  out.
[4005.88 --> 4006.58]  All that
[4006.58 --> 4007.22]  value
[4007.22 --> 4009.08]  a truck's
[4009.08 --> 4009.62]  worth of
[4009.62 --> 4010.06]  worship
[4010.06 --> 4012.12]  for one
[4012.12 --> 4012.52]  moment
[4012.52 --> 4015.32]  would you
[4015.32 --> 4015.68]  do the
[4015.68 --> 4015.90]  same?
[4018.04 --> 4018.46]  Is
[4018.46 --> 4019.00]  Jesus
[4019.00 --> 4019.60]  is the
[4019.60 --> 4020.26]  worship of
[4020.26 --> 4020.62]  Jesus
[4020.62 --> 4021.70]  worth your
[4021.70 --> 4021.94]  new
[4021.94 --> 4022.34]  truck?
[4024.72 --> 4025.28]  As you
[4025.28 --> 4025.82]  ask that
[4025.82 --> 4026.34]  question of
[4026.34 --> 4026.60]  yourself
[4026.60 --> 4027.20]  let me
[4027.20 --> 4027.96]  offer just
[4027.96 --> 4028.36]  a really
[4028.36 --> 4029.12]  quick aside
[4029.12 --> 4029.34]  here
[4029.34 --> 4029.58]  right?
[4030.62 --> 4031.26]  In our
[4031.26 --> 4031.58]  worship
[4031.58 --> 4032.04]  together
[4032.04 --> 4032.92]  sometimes
[4032.92 --> 4034.18]  when it
[4034.18 --> 4034.62]  comes time
[4034.62 --> 4035.06]  to do the
[4035.06 --> 4035.48]  offering
[4035.48 --> 4036.08]  that slide
[4036.08 --> 4036.78]  pops up
[4036.78 --> 4037.22]  right?
[4037.28 --> 4037.70]  The deacons
[4037.70 --> 4038.06]  come up
[4038.06 --> 4038.30]  to the
[4038.30 --> 4038.60]  front
[4038.60 --> 4039.80]  and we
[4039.80 --> 4040.24]  go okay
[4040.24 --> 4040.68]  now it's
[4040.68 --> 4040.98]  time for
[4040.98 --> 4041.28]  just a
[4041.28 --> 4041.40]  little
[4041.40 --> 4041.74]  break
[4041.74 --> 4043.18]  right?
[4043.26 --> 4043.64]  Maybe we
[4043.64 --> 4044.10]  listen to
[4044.10 --> 4044.52]  the deacons
[4044.52 --> 4044.94]  maybe we
[4044.94 --> 4045.76]  don't
[4045.76 --> 4045.98]  right?
[4046.02 --> 4046.38]  We think
[4046.38 --> 4046.90]  that you
[4046.90 --> 4047.02]  know
[4047.02 --> 4047.60]  charitably
[4047.60 --> 4048.08]  this is
[4048.08 --> 4048.64]  something we
[4048.64 --> 4049.10]  have to
[4049.10 --> 4049.52]  do in
[4049.52 --> 4049.82]  order to
[4049.82 --> 4050.32]  get back
[4050.32 --> 4050.84]  to worship
[4050.84 --> 4052.22]  right?
[4052.28 --> 4052.96]  We know
[4052.96 --> 4053.40]  that we
[4053.40 --> 4053.74]  need to
[4053.74 --> 4054.32]  give in
[4054.32 --> 4054.90]  support of
[4054.90 --> 4055.44]  the ministries
[4055.44 --> 4055.72]  and the
[4055.72 --> 4056.22]  missions of
[4056.22 --> 4056.78]  this church
[4056.78 --> 4057.76]  so that
[4057.76 --> 4058.04]  you know
[4058.04 --> 4058.48]  we can
[4058.48 --> 4059.26]  worship well
[4059.26 --> 4059.78]  and so that
[4059.78 --> 4060.06]  we can
[4060.06 --> 4061.08]  make disciples
[4061.08 --> 4061.60]  and we can
[4061.60 --> 4062.32]  be used of
[4062.32 --> 4062.72]  God to
[4062.72 --> 4063.68]  teach new
[4063.68 --> 4064.12]  disciples
[4064.12 --> 4064.94]  everything that
[4064.94 --> 4065.68]  we have
[4065.68 --> 4066.26]  learned from
[4066.26 --> 4066.46]  him.
[4067.62 --> 4068.36]  We know
[4068.36 --> 4068.76]  that we
[4068.76 --> 4069.18]  need to
[4069.18 --> 4070.08]  give to
[4070.08 --> 4070.88]  support other
[4070.88 --> 4071.64]  causes or
[4071.64 --> 4071.94]  other
[4071.94 --> 4072.64]  organizations.
[4073.26 --> 4073.68]  We might
[4073.68 --> 4074.26]  even believe
[4074.26 --> 4074.62]  that it's
[4074.62 --> 4075.12]  good and
[4075.12 --> 4075.34]  it's
[4075.34 --> 4075.90]  necessary.
[4077.36 --> 4077.98]  But the
[4077.98 --> 4078.38]  point of
[4078.38 --> 4078.92]  this story
[4078.92 --> 4079.24]  or at least
[4079.24 --> 4079.70]  one of the
[4079.70 --> 4080.10]  points of
[4080.10 --> 4080.68]  this story
[4080.68 --> 4081.56]  for our
[4081.56 --> 4082.52]  offering in
[4082.52 --> 4083.66]  worship is
[4083.66 --> 4084.28]  that the
[4084.28 --> 4086.08]  offering is
[4086.08 --> 4087.30]  worship.
[4088.54 --> 4089.72]  Your giving
[4089.72 --> 4090.70]  is an act
[4090.70 --> 4091.78]  of worship.
[4092.00 --> 4092.58]  Passing that
[4092.58 --> 4093.32]  bag around
[4093.32 --> 4093.88]  week after
[4093.88 --> 4094.82]  week is a
[4094.82 --> 4095.86]  liturgy of
[4095.86 --> 4096.68]  trusting in the
[4096.68 --> 4097.28]  providence of
[4097.28 --> 4097.68]  God and
[4097.68 --> 4098.28]  thanking him
[4098.28 --> 4098.60]  for his
[4098.60 --> 4099.20]  good gifts.
[4099.60 --> 4100.32]  Setting up a
[4100.32 --> 4101.30]  direct deposit
[4101.30 --> 4103.92]  circumstance here
[4103.92 --> 4104.48]  in our church
[4104.48 --> 4105.38]  so that 10%
[4105.38 --> 4106.18]  of your paycheck
[4106.18 --> 4107.08]  is automatically
[4107.08 --> 4107.74]  sent to the
[4107.74 --> 4108.48]  church is a
[4108.48 --> 4108.92]  rhythm of
[4108.92 --> 4109.24]  worship.
[4109.70 --> 4110.84]  Clicking the
[4110.84 --> 4111.76]  send button on
[4111.76 --> 4112.74]  that e-transfer
[4112.74 --> 4113.88]  every week is
[4113.88 --> 4114.68]  a liturgy of
[4114.68 --> 4115.32]  love and a
[4115.32 --> 4116.22]  beautiful expression
[4116.22 --> 4116.98]  of God's
[4116.98 --> 4117.68]  goodness.
[4119.24 --> 4120.12]  And if, as
[4120.12 --> 4120.94]  I said that,
[4121.82 --> 4122.78]  all you heard
[4122.78 --> 4124.52]  was 10%,
[4124.52 --> 4125.74]  you've got to
[4125.74 --> 4126.34]  be kidding me.
[4127.02 --> 4127.70]  I can't live on
[4127.70 --> 4128.50]  10% less than
[4128.50 --> 4129.10]  what I'm currently
[4129.10 --> 4129.84]  giving or making.
[4131.74 --> 4132.60]  You might be in
[4132.60 --> 4132.90]  the danger
[4132.90 --> 4133.76]  stone of this
[4133.76 --> 4134.10]  story.
[4134.10 --> 4139.52]  if, on the
[4139.52 --> 4140.12]  other hand now,
[4141.90 --> 4143.84]  you think that
[4143.84 --> 4145.26]  giving a year's
[4145.26 --> 4146.84]  salary could
[4146.84 --> 4147.84]  solve a lot
[4147.84 --> 4148.58]  more, quote,
[4148.86 --> 4149.92]  more important
[4149.92 --> 4151.96]  problems than
[4151.96 --> 4152.80]  our worship,
[4154.80 --> 4155.40]  you also,
[4155.96 --> 4156.72]  finding yourself
[4156.72 --> 4157.36]  in the company
[4157.36 --> 4158.80]  of those in
[4158.80 --> 4159.62]  this story,
[4159.72 --> 4160.24]  the company of
[4160.24 --> 4161.02]  people for whom
[4161.02 --> 4161.68]  and against
[4161.68 --> 4163.26]  whom this
[4163.26 --> 4164.26]  unnamed woman
[4164.26 --> 4165.80]  is a foil.
[4168.70 --> 4169.56]  Some of those
[4169.56 --> 4170.94]  present were
[4170.94 --> 4172.10]  saying indignantly
[4172.10 --> 4172.82]  to one another,
[4174.30 --> 4175.78]  why waste this,
[4176.16 --> 4177.52]  why this waste
[4177.52 --> 4178.18]  of perfume?
[4179.38 --> 4179.76]  It could have
[4179.76 --> 4180.38]  been sold for
[4180.38 --> 4180.94]  more than a
[4180.94 --> 4182.28]  year's wages and
[4182.28 --> 4183.02]  the money given
[4183.02 --> 4183.70]  to the poor,
[4184.02 --> 4185.02]  and they rebuked
[4185.02 --> 4186.80]  her harshly.
[4191.02 --> 4192.22]  There is a
[4192.22 --> 4193.12]  question here
[4193.12 --> 4194.66]  of competing
[4194.66 --> 4196.12]  priorities,
[4196.64 --> 4197.92]  because serving
[4197.92 --> 4198.40]  the poor is
[4198.40 --> 4200.00]  good, right?
[4200.20 --> 4201.58]  Giving to other
[4201.58 --> 4202.52]  organizations is
[4202.52 --> 4203.40]  good, and it is
[4203.40 --> 4204.32]  necessary, and it
[4204.32 --> 4205.26]  is right,
[4206.86 --> 4208.40]  but never,
[4208.78 --> 4210.96]  never to the
[4210.96 --> 4213.02]  exclusion to
[4213.02 --> 4213.60]  worship
[4213.60 --> 4214.86]  Jesus.
[4217.16 --> 4218.82]  A social
[4218.82 --> 4220.02]  philosopher and
[4220.02 --> 4220.76]  commentator
[4220.76 --> 4223.12]  podcast I
[4223.12 --> 4223.50]  listen to
[4223.50 --> 4223.98]  regularly,
[4224.18 --> 4224.54]  it's called
[4224.54 --> 4225.08]  The Symbolic
[4225.08 --> 4225.32]  World.
[4225.42 --> 4225.78]  His name is
[4225.78 --> 4226.54]  Jonathan Peugeot,
[4226.64 --> 4227.14]  he's out of
[4227.14 --> 4227.50]  Montreal.
[4229.70 --> 4230.54]  He actually
[4230.54 --> 4231.26]  calls what's
[4231.26 --> 4232.20]  going on here
[4232.20 --> 4233.80]  weaponized
[4233.80 --> 4234.72]  compassion.
[4236.96 --> 4237.46]  Weaponized
[4237.46 --> 4238.12]  compassion,
[4238.36 --> 4238.74]  and so the
[4238.74 --> 4240.12]  idea is that
[4240.12 --> 4241.00]  you take
[4241.00 --> 4241.52]  something that
[4241.52 --> 4242.38]  is good,
[4242.56 --> 4243.08]  and the
[4243.08 --> 4243.94]  need for
[4243.94 --> 4244.46]  something,
[4244.54 --> 4245.32]  like caring
[4245.32 --> 4245.72]  for the
[4245.72 --> 4246.06]  poor,
[4246.24 --> 4246.76]  and you
[4246.76 --> 4247.30]  turn it
[4247.30 --> 4248.14]  into a
[4248.14 --> 4249.20]  weapon to
[4249.20 --> 4249.90]  stop people
[4249.90 --> 4250.38]  from doing
[4250.38 --> 4250.98]  something that
[4250.98 --> 4253.14]  is notably
[4253.14 --> 4254.36]  better,
[4255.74 --> 4256.32]  the worship
[4256.32 --> 4257.46]  Jesus.
[4259.52 --> 4261.22]  We live in
[4261.22 --> 4262.28]  a society and
[4262.28 --> 4263.52]  a culture that
[4263.52 --> 4264.32]  weaponizes
[4264.32 --> 4265.44]  compassion all
[4265.44 --> 4266.68]  the time in
[4266.68 --> 4266.96]  order to
[4266.96 --> 4267.82]  accomplish this
[4267.82 --> 4269.22]  ideal or good
[4269.22 --> 4270.58]  or this cultural
[4270.58 --> 4272.52]  norm or this
[4272.52 --> 4273.36]  or that or the
[4273.36 --> 4274.58]  other thing to
[4274.58 --> 4275.96]  the exclusion,
[4275.96 --> 4278.28]  religion, the
[4278.28 --> 4279.26]  recognition and
[4279.26 --> 4280.14]  the worship of
[4280.14 --> 4281.84]  God provides
[4281.84 --> 4282.36]  for it all.
[4284.20 --> 4285.16]  The supreme
[4285.16 --> 4285.92]  value of
[4285.92 --> 4286.96]  Jesus far
[4286.96 --> 4288.16]  outweighs all
[4288.16 --> 4289.66]  other things of
[4289.66 --> 4290.62]  worth in this
[4290.62 --> 4291.82]  life, and so
[4291.82 --> 4293.44]  the poor you
[4293.44 --> 4294.18]  will always have
[4294.18 --> 4294.60]  with you.
[4294.72 --> 4295.38]  You can help
[4295.38 --> 4296.18]  them anytime
[4296.18 --> 4297.30]  you want.
[4297.38 --> 4297.74]  Notice what
[4297.74 --> 4298.36]  Jesus says,
[4298.62 --> 4299.10]  right, saying
[4299.10 --> 4299.26]  there.
[4299.32 --> 4299.80]  He doesn't say
[4299.80 --> 4300.28]  don't help
[4300.28 --> 4300.48]  them.
[4301.66 --> 4302.14]  You could do
[4302.14 --> 4302.74]  that anytime,
[4302.74 --> 4303.54]  but you
[4303.54 --> 4303.94]  will not
[4303.94 --> 4304.82]  always have
[4304.82 --> 4305.66]  me.
[4307.70 --> 4308.48]  Sitting with
[4308.48 --> 4310.44]  me is worth
[4310.44 --> 4312.12]  even more
[4312.12 --> 4313.46]  than this
[4313.46 --> 4315.20]  good thing,
[4316.12 --> 4316.78]  is even
[4316.78 --> 4318.32]  more
[4318.32 --> 4319.62]  responsible
[4319.62 --> 4321.54]  of you
[4321.54 --> 4322.96]  than this
[4322.96 --> 4324.40]  other good
[4324.40 --> 4325.52]  responsibility.
[4326.74 --> 4327.18]  She
[4327.18 --> 4328.18]  recognizes
[4328.18 --> 4330.54]  that the
[4330.54 --> 4331.46]  supreme value
[4331.46 --> 4332.16]  of Jesus
[4332.16 --> 4334.48]  far outweighs
[4334.48 --> 4338.34]  over 300
[4338.34 --> 4339.64]  denarii,
[4339.70 --> 4340.66]  over a
[4340.66 --> 4341.16]  year's
[4341.16 --> 4342.30]  salary.
[4343.08 --> 4343.42]  And it
[4343.42 --> 4344.14]  is her
[4344.14 --> 4345.74]  worship in
[4345.74 --> 4346.42]  that moment
[4346.42 --> 4347.82]  that Jesus
[4347.82 --> 4348.78]  calls.
[4351.22 --> 4351.70]  There's a
[4351.70 --> 4353.82]  beauty, really,
[4353.96 --> 4354.62]  of this
[4354.62 --> 4356.96]  moment for
[4356.96 --> 4357.52]  worship,
[4358.02 --> 4358.46]  the beauty
[4358.46 --> 4359.26]  of her
[4359.26 --> 4360.38]  actions in
[4360.38 --> 4360.90]  worship,
[4361.10 --> 4361.56]  is that it's
[4361.56 --> 4363.22]  a foreshadowing
[4363.22 --> 4363.96]  of what we
[4363.96 --> 4364.38]  know the
[4364.38 --> 4364.94]  gospel to
[4364.94 --> 4365.16]  be.
[4365.66 --> 4366.64]  Jesus said,
[4366.78 --> 4367.10]  she poured
[4367.10 --> 4367.76]  perfume on
[4367.76 --> 4368.18]  my body
[4368.18 --> 4368.98]  beforehand to
[4368.98 --> 4370.18]  prepare for
[4370.18 --> 4371.48]  my burial.
[4372.62 --> 4373.08]  Jesus is
[4373.08 --> 4373.32]  saying,
[4373.76 --> 4374.42]  in just a
[4374.42 --> 4375.06]  few days,
[4375.16 --> 4375.94]  I will
[4375.94 --> 4376.94]  die.
[4377.90 --> 4378.62]  In just a
[4378.62 --> 4379.08]  few days,
[4379.16 --> 4379.88]  I will bear
[4379.88 --> 4380.56]  the weight
[4380.56 --> 4381.42]  of God's
[4381.42 --> 4382.28]  wrath for
[4382.28 --> 4382.84]  all the
[4382.84 --> 4383.70]  sin in
[4383.70 --> 4384.12]  the world.
[4384.38 --> 4384.90]  I will
[4384.90 --> 4385.48]  bear that
[4385.48 --> 4386.02]  on my
[4386.02 --> 4386.42]  shoulders
[4386.42 --> 4387.30]  for you.
[4387.30 --> 4388.14]  It is my
[4388.14 --> 4389.12]  love that
[4389.12 --> 4390.00]  drives me to
[4390.00 --> 4390.56]  the cross,
[4390.72 --> 4391.10]  and I
[4391.10 --> 4392.06]  bear that
[4392.06 --> 4392.82]  for you.
[4393.56 --> 4394.08]  Jesus has
[4394.08 --> 4394.54]  come to
[4394.54 --> 4395.06]  live the
[4395.06 --> 4395.58]  life I
[4395.58 --> 4395.94]  should have
[4395.94 --> 4396.20]  lived,
[4396.26 --> 4396.52]  and to
[4396.52 --> 4397.00]  die the
[4397.00 --> 4397.64]  death that
[4397.64 --> 4398.06]  I deserve.
[4398.16 --> 4398.58]  And in
[4398.58 --> 4399.60]  that moment,
[4399.70 --> 4400.40]  those three
[4400.40 --> 4401.24]  days before,
[4401.42 --> 4401.90]  he is
[4401.90 --> 4402.24]  saying,
[4402.48 --> 4403.60]  don't miss
[4403.60 --> 4404.72]  the supreme
[4404.72 --> 4406.00]  value of
[4406.00 --> 4406.48]  what I
[4406.48 --> 4407.36]  do for
[4407.36 --> 4407.72]  you.
[4411.72 --> 4412.24]  They
[4412.24 --> 4412.70]  didn't see
[4412.70 --> 4412.90]  it.
[4412.90 --> 4414.28]  Jesus
[4414.28 --> 4414.66]  knew,
[4415.74 --> 4416.50]  but their
[4416.50 --> 4416.94]  eyes were
[4416.94 --> 4417.90]  focused down
[4417.90 --> 4418.14]  here.
[4419.66 --> 4420.50]  Her eyes,
[4420.66 --> 4421.48]  her eyes
[4421.48 --> 4422.24]  were focused
[4422.24 --> 4424.04]  on Jesus.
[4426.62 --> 4427.28]  Where are
[4427.28 --> 4427.62]  your eyes
[4427.62 --> 4428.14]  focused?
[4429.66 --> 4430.02]  We gather
[4430.02 --> 4430.42]  this morning.
[4433.14 --> 4433.50]  Jesus'
[4433.70 --> 4434.10]  anointing
[4434.10 --> 4434.90]  prepares him
[4434.90 --> 4435.82]  for what is
[4435.82 --> 4436.22]  next,
[4436.56 --> 4436.92]  but the
[4436.92 --> 4437.82]  disciples didn't
[4437.82 --> 4438.76]  even know
[4438.76 --> 4439.48]  or fully
[4439.48 --> 4440.30]  understand,
[4440.46 --> 4441.10]  but she
[4441.10 --> 4442.40]  did.
[4442.90 --> 4444.88]  Jesus'
[4445.18 --> 4445.80]  anointing
[4445.80 --> 4447.04]  is an
[4447.04 --> 4447.62]  act of
[4447.62 --> 4448.66]  worship in
[4448.66 --> 4449.44]  the face of
[4449.44 --> 4450.24]  whatever comes
[4450.24 --> 4451.18]  next, in
[4451.18 --> 4451.70]  the face of
[4451.70 --> 4452.42]  the unknown
[4452.42 --> 4453.28]  next, in
[4453.28 --> 4453.90]  the face of
[4453.90 --> 4455.06]  the atrocity
[4455.06 --> 4455.62]  and the
[4455.62 --> 4456.22]  horrors of
[4456.22 --> 4456.76]  the cross.
[4457.20 --> 4457.48]  Jesus'
[4457.68 --> 4458.40]  anointing is
[4458.40 --> 4459.48]  an act of
[4459.48 --> 4459.78]  worship.
[4459.94 --> 4460.26]  And so,
[4460.40 --> 4460.88]  for you,
[4461.22 --> 4461.94]  whatever comes
[4461.94 --> 4462.78]  next, whatever
[4462.78 --> 4464.22]  atrocities you
[4464.22 --> 4464.72]  face, whatever
[4464.72 --> 4465.56]  trials or
[4465.56 --> 4466.44]  tribulations or
[4466.44 --> 4467.44]  challenges that
[4467.44 --> 4468.08]  are in these
[4468.08 --> 4468.80]  days ahead,
[4468.80 --> 4473.16]  how will
[4473.16 --> 4473.62]  you
[4473.62 --> 4475.06]  worship?
[4478.90 --> 4480.62]  Jesus is
[4480.62 --> 4480.96]  anointed.
[4481.10 --> 4482.18]  In fact, we
[4482.18 --> 4482.74]  call Jesus
[4482.74 --> 4483.36]  Messiah.
[4484.36 --> 4485.72]  Messiah is a
[4485.72 --> 4487.40]  Hebrew word,
[4487.50 --> 4487.78]  Messiah.
[4488.22 --> 4488.86]  In the New
[4488.86 --> 4489.36]  Testament, we
[4489.36 --> 4490.08]  call it Christ.
[4490.24 --> 4490.88]  That's just the
[4490.88 --> 4492.68]  translation of
[4492.68 --> 4493.16]  Messiah.
[4493.16 --> 4493.22]  Messiah.
[4495.10 --> 4496.40]  Jesus is the
[4496.40 --> 4497.10]  Messiah, and
[4497.10 --> 4498.06]  Messiah in
[4498.06 --> 4499.10]  Hebrew means
[4499.10 --> 4500.70]  anointed one.
[4502.28 --> 4503.36]  He has been
[4503.36 --> 4504.02]  anointed,
[4505.30 --> 4505.74]  suffer,
[4506.66 --> 4507.40]  and die.
[4509.62 --> 4510.60]  But did you
[4510.60 --> 4512.60]  know that the
[4512.60 --> 4513.52]  word Christian,
[4514.06 --> 4515.54]  right, the word
[4515.54 --> 4516.30]  Christian was
[4516.30 --> 4517.38]  first used as
[4517.38 --> 4518.56]  an insult to
[4518.56 --> 4519.20]  those people who
[4519.20 --> 4519.94]  were disciples of
[4519.94 --> 4520.48]  Jesus, right?
[4520.50 --> 4521.26]  You get that out
[4521.26 --> 4521.90]  of 1 Peter,
[4522.00 --> 4522.12]  right?
[4522.12 --> 4522.94]  If you suffer
[4522.94 --> 4523.94]  for being called
[4523.94 --> 4525.14]  Christian, right,
[4525.36 --> 4526.76]  take it as joy,
[4526.96 --> 4527.58]  my brothers and
[4527.58 --> 4527.96]  sisters.
[4529.08 --> 4529.62]  The word Christian
[4529.62 --> 4530.60]  was first meant as
[4530.60 --> 4531.18]  an insult, but
[4531.18 --> 4532.06]  here in that,
[4532.40 --> 4532.86]  Christian,
[4533.08 --> 4533.98]  Christos, right,
[4534.22 --> 4535.96]  little Christ, so
[4535.96 --> 4536.98]  little anointed
[4536.98 --> 4537.46]  ones.
[4537.84 --> 4538.40]  To be a
[4538.40 --> 4539.70]  Christian means to
[4539.70 --> 4540.82]  share in the
[4540.82 --> 4542.06]  anointing of
[4542.06 --> 4542.48]  Jesus.
[4543.40 --> 4544.42]  That's what being a
[4544.42 --> 4545.00]  Christian means.
[4545.06 --> 4545.54]  It doesn't mean
[4545.54 --> 4546.28]  first and foremost
[4546.28 --> 4547.38]  living a good life.
[4547.44 --> 4547.84]  It doesn't mean
[4547.84 --> 4548.68]  trying to be obedient
[4548.68 --> 4549.46]  to God, although we
[4549.46 --> 4550.12]  do both of those
[4550.12 --> 4550.34]  things.
[4550.42 --> 4551.16]  We long for both
[4551.16 --> 4551.66]  of those things.
[4551.66 --> 4552.58]  It doesn't mean
[4552.58 --> 4554.44]  that we, you
[4554.44 --> 4555.08]  know, have it all
[4555.08 --> 4555.78]  together and that
[4555.78 --> 4556.28]  we're part of a
[4556.28 --> 4557.02]  good social club
[4557.02 --> 4557.48]  that's going to
[4557.48 --> 4558.00]  have soup and
[4558.00 --> 4558.78]  buns after church,
[4558.82 --> 4559.38]  although that is
[4559.38 --> 4560.10]  happening too.
[4560.92 --> 4561.98]  Being a Christian
[4561.98 --> 4563.06]  first and foremost
[4563.06 --> 4564.52]  means to share in
[4564.52 --> 4566.64]  the anointing of
[4566.64 --> 4567.48]  Christ and in
[4567.48 --> 4568.82]  sharing in the
[4568.82 --> 4569.70]  anointing of
[4569.70 --> 4572.42]  Jesus, we may not
[4572.42 --> 4573.60]  know what is next.
[4575.32 --> 4576.90]  We too must
[4576.90 --> 4578.12]  worship.
[4578.12 --> 4581.54]  even if, as we
[4581.54 --> 4582.20]  read, you know,
[4582.26 --> 4583.08]  Jesus says to
[4583.08 --> 4584.36]  daily take up
[4584.36 --> 4585.28]  our cross, even
[4585.28 --> 4586.56]  if the cross of
[4586.56 --> 4587.68]  faith is next
[4587.68 --> 4588.96]  for you, we
[4588.96 --> 4590.84]  must worship.
[4592.84 --> 4595.22]  So, I need
[4595.22 --> 4596.96]  this now, we
[4596.96 --> 4598.14]  need this now,
[4598.24 --> 4598.98]  the supreme
[4598.98 --> 4600.14]  value of Jesus
[4600.14 --> 4601.66]  to be true
[4601.66 --> 4604.38]  because we all
[4604.38 --> 4606.02]  need this to be
[4606.02 --> 4606.26]  true.
[4606.26 --> 4606.30]  true.
[4607.20 --> 4607.90]  Here's what I
[4607.90 --> 4608.46]  mean when I say
[4608.46 --> 4608.70]  that.
[4609.48 --> 4610.04]  The supreme
[4610.04 --> 4610.90]  value of Jesus
[4610.90 --> 4612.32]  is true because
[4612.32 --> 4613.56]  I need a
[4613.56 --> 4613.90]  savior.
[4614.84 --> 4616.18]  When I look at
[4616.18 --> 4617.36]  my life, when I
[4617.36 --> 4618.32]  look at the
[4618.32 --> 4619.16]  world, what I
[4619.16 --> 4620.38]  see time and
[4620.38 --> 4621.22]  time again is
[4621.22 --> 4622.08]  that I can't do
[4622.08 --> 4622.30]  it.
[4623.92 --> 4625.66]  I fail over and
[4625.66 --> 4626.60]  over and over
[4626.60 --> 4626.88]  again.
[4627.04 --> 4628.16]  I need one who
[4628.16 --> 4629.96]  is perfect and
[4629.96 --> 4631.80]  Jesus is him.
[4631.90 --> 4632.66]  I need the
[4632.66 --> 4633.52]  supreme value of
[4633.52 --> 4634.28]  Jesus to be true,
[4634.38 --> 4635.46]  not because I've
[4635.46 --> 4636.24]  bet my life on
[4636.24 --> 4636.68]  it, though I
[4636.68 --> 4638.06]  have, but
[4638.06 --> 4638.98]  because if he
[4638.98 --> 4643.16]  is not, this is
[4643.16 --> 4643.68]  all we have.
[4645.76 --> 4646.54]  Failure is where
[4646.54 --> 4647.66]  we stand.
[4649.92 --> 4650.82]  And the supreme
[4650.82 --> 4651.90]  value of Jesus is
[4651.90 --> 4653.84]  true for all of
[4653.84 --> 4655.60]  us because we
[4655.60 --> 4656.92]  begin to see,
[4657.10 --> 4657.82]  even here,
[4658.02 --> 4658.94]  through the story
[4658.94 --> 4660.26]  of this beautiful
[4660.26 --> 4662.94]  woman, we begin
[4662.94 --> 4664.80]  to see that we
[4664.80 --> 4665.84]  need our
[4665.84 --> 4666.80]  priorities.
[4667.60 --> 4668.58]  We need those
[4668.58 --> 4670.48]  attention-seeking
[4670.48 --> 4671.64]  things, those
[4671.64 --> 4673.98]  worth-ships,
[4674.04 --> 4674.16]  right?
[4674.24 --> 4674.84]  The word
[4674.84 --> 4675.50]  worship is
[4675.50 --> 4676.26]  acknowledging the
[4676.26 --> 4676.80]  worth of
[4676.80 --> 4677.76]  something to be
[4677.76 --> 4677.96]  praised.
[4678.18 --> 4678.70]  We need the
[4678.70 --> 4680.10]  focus of our
[4680.10 --> 4681.22]  activities and
[4681.22 --> 4682.02]  our heart's
[4682.02 --> 4682.92]  affections.
[4683.32 --> 4684.08]  We need those
[4684.08 --> 4685.30]  things properly
[4685.30 --> 4687.38]  ordered in order
[4687.38 --> 4688.80]  to know what is
[4688.80 --> 4689.54]  a truly
[4689.54 --> 4691.58]  flourishing life.
[4691.76 --> 4692.30]  And so to use
[4692.30 --> 4693.02]  this story,
[4693.50 --> 4694.90]  Jesus and this
[4694.90 --> 4696.32]  woman might be
[4696.32 --> 4697.18]  the only two
[4697.18 --> 4698.06]  people in this
[4698.06 --> 4699.10]  story who are
[4699.10 --> 4700.64]  truly alive.
[4703.64 --> 4704.32]  Because
[4704.32 --> 4706.24]  they know.
[4707.24 --> 4708.14]  They know who
[4708.14 --> 4709.50]  he is and what
[4709.50 --> 4710.18]  he has done.
[4710.18 --> 4714.94]  Jesus is the
[4714.94 --> 4716.12]  ultimate,
[4716.96 --> 4717.46]  truly,
[4718.14 --> 4719.42]  fully alive,
[4720.10 --> 4721.30]  fully human
[4721.30 --> 4722.60]  person.
[4724.82 --> 4726.34]  And for us to
[4726.34 --> 4728.12]  be fully human
[4728.12 --> 4729.24]  and fully alive,
[4729.46 --> 4730.28]  we must
[4730.28 --> 4732.04]  him.
[4732.72 --> 4733.48]  And we must
[4733.48 --> 4735.08]  order our life
[4735.08 --> 4736.18]  in relationship
[4736.18 --> 4737.46]  to him.
[4737.46 --> 4740.60]  the supreme
[4740.60 --> 4741.78]  value of
[4741.78 --> 4742.90]  Jesus is
[4742.90 --> 4744.18]  greater than
[4744.18 --> 4745.66]  all other
[4745.66 --> 4746.90]  claims,
[4747.42 --> 4748.50]  all other
[4748.50 --> 4749.52]  things.
[4749.66 --> 4750.30]  And when we

[4751.78 --> 4753.38]  that truth,
[4755.10 --> 4755.62]  then,
[4755.92 --> 4756.54]  my brothers
[4756.54 --> 4757.12]  and sisters,
[4757.86 --> 4758.78]  then does
[4758.78 --> 4760.40]  life really
[4760.40 --> 4761.58]  begin.
[4762.86 --> 4763.16]  Amen.
[4764.16 --> 4764.68]  Pray together.
[4764.68 --> 4764.80]  Amen.
[4767.46 --> 4770.54]  Lord our God,
[4770.70 --> 4771.84]  focus our
[4771.84 --> 4773.52]  hearts on.
[4775.44 --> 4776.24]  Focus our
[4776.24 --> 4776.74]  loves and
[4776.74 --> 4777.58]  affections on
[4777.58 --> 4778.08]  you, Lord
[4778.08 --> 4778.34]  Jesus.

[4779.84 --> 4781.70]  most clearly
[4781.70 --> 4782.92]  today.
[4785.50 --> 4786.34]  And as we
[4786.34 --> 4787.02]  go from this
[4787.02 --> 4787.98]  place, may our
[4787.98 --> 4789.44]  priorities be

[4791.88 --> 4793.00]  as

[4808.10 --> 4809.88]  your betrayal,
[4810.66 --> 4811.30]  as we
[4811.30 --> 4811.76]  anticipate
[4811.76 --> 4813.06]  your last
[4813.06 --> 4813.50]  supper,

[4817.44 --> 4818.18]  on the
[4818.18 --> 4818.70]  cross,
[4820.70 --> 4821.64]  may we
[4821.64 --> 4822.64]  fix our
[4822.64 --> 4824.10]  eyes firmly
[4824.10 --> 4825.28]  on.
[4829.28 --> 4830.38]  Go now,
[4830.58 --> 4831.02]  Lord God,
[4831.10 --> 4831.62]  with our
[4831.62 --> 4832.10]  hearts
[4832.10 --> 4833.58]  stirred and
[4833.58 --> 4834.66]  send us

[4835.78 --> 4836.60]  stir
[4836.60 --> 4837.82]  hearts.

[4840.96 --> 4841.28]  pray.
[4842.02 --> 4842.40]  Amen.
[4852.64 --> 4875.86]  my heart is
[4875.86 --> 4878.96]  full of

[4901.70 --> 4903.30]  my spirit

[4954.42 --> 4955.40]  on high.
[4955.40 --> 4957.40]  and on
[4957.40 --> 4959.40]  your head
[4960.76 --> 4961.40]  pours
[4961.96 --> 4962.82]  oil of

[5095.40 --> 5098.40]  As you go,
[5098.40 --> 5099.40]  just a note about the palm branches.
[5099.40 --> 5102.40]  You might remember we encouraged the same last year.
[5102.40 --> 5104.40]  Take those home with you and then,
[5105.40 --> 5107.40]  through crafting or otherwise abilities,
[5107.40 --> 5115.16]  wise abilities, turn them into a wreath and hang it on your door that you might say to the community,
[5115.16 --> 5125.66]  this is holy week. This is week that we come to see Jesus on the cross and that we wait in hope
[5125.66 --> 5133.42]  for Sunday. There may be a few extras if you would like to do so. Grab a couple. I know some of you
[5133.42 --> 5136.66]  already have plans to share them with your neighbors and people in your communities and
[5136.66 --> 5145.94]  buildings, so go ahead and do that. But just take them and turn them into a door hanger or share them
[5145.94 --> 5153.34]  with the people around you. As you go this week, go with the blessing of our God.
[5155.08 --> 5163.92]  God, go before you to lead you. God, go behind you to guard you. God, go beneath you to support you.
[5163.92 --> 5174.54]  And God, go beside you to befriend you. Do not be afraid. Vaya con Dios. Do not be afraid.
[5175.20 --> 5184.14]  Vaya con Dios. Go in peace to love and serve the Lord. Amen.
[5184.14 --> 5201.30]  Great is he who's the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords. He is wonderful.
[5201.30 --> 5214.92]  Great is he who's the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords. He is wonderful.
[5214.92 --> 5228.72]  Great is he who's the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords. He is wonderful.
[5228.72 --> 5243.00]  Great is he who's the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords. He is wonderful.

[5272.92 --> 5286.48]  Great is He who's the King of Peace, and the Lord of Lords, He is wonderful.
