[0.00 → 16.86] God of your promise, you don't speak in vain, no syllable empty or void.
[16.86 → 32.82] For once you have spoken, all nature and science follow the sound of your voice.
[32.82 → 46.00] Ooh, and as you speak, a hundred billion creatures catch your breath.
[46.00 → 60.46] Ooh, and as you speak, a hundred billion creatures catch your breath.
[60.46 → 71.44] Ooh, and as you speak, a hundred billion creatures catch your breath.
[71.44 → 77.04] Every pain is God, a canvas of your grace.
[77.04 → 83.68] If creation still obeys you, so alive.
[83.68 → 91.86] So alive.
[91.86 → 98.96] So alive.
[98.96 → 104.56] Ooh, and as you speak, a hundred billion creatures catch your breath.
[104.56 → 108.56] Ooh, and as you speak, a hundred billion creatures catch your breath.
[108.56 → 109.46] So alive.
[109.46 → 110.68] So alive.
[110.68 → 111.56] So alive.
[111.56 → 112.56] So alive.
[112.56 → 113.56] So alive.
[113.56 → 119.42] And as you speak, a hundred billion creatures catch your breath.
[119.42 → 120.06] So alive.
[120.06 → 121.12] So alive.
[121.12 → 127.48] And as you speak, a hundred billion creatures catch your breath.
[127.48 → 132.48] And if the oceans roar your greatness, so will I.
[134.62 → 141.70] For if everything exists to lift you high, so will I.
[141.70 → 147.46] And if the wind goes where you send, so will I.
[149.34 → 154.86] If the rocks cry out in silence, so will I.
[157.48 → 162.46] If the sum of all our prayers still fall shy.
[164.86 → 170.46] And we'll sing again a hundred billion times.
[170.46 → 171.46] Oh.
[187.48 → 197.16] God of salvation, you chased down my heart through all of my failure and pride.
[197.16 → 205.58] On a hill you created.
[206.54 → 211.88] The light of the world abandoned in darkness to die.
[211.88 → 218.88] And as you speak.
[218.88 → 225.76] A hundred billion failures disappeared.
[225.76 → 234.24] Where you lost your life so I could find it here.
[234.24 → 241.42] And if you left the grave behind you, so will I.
[241.42 → 248.22] I could see your heart in everything you've done.
[248.22 → 256.76] Every part designed in a work of our calm love.
[256.76 → 263.76] If you gladly chose surrender, so will I.
[263.76 → 270.94] I could see your heart and feel you a different way.
[270.94 → 271.94] Every precious one.
[271.94 → 275.94] Every precious one.
[275.94 → 277.94] A child you died to save.
[277.94 → 278.94] Every precious one.
[278.94 → 279.94] A child you died to save.
[279.94 → 283.94] And if you gave your life to love them so alive.
[283.94 → 294.94] Like you would again a hundred billion times.
[294.94 → 302.94] But what measure could amount to your desire?
[302.94 → 308.94] You're the one who never leaves the one behind.
[308.94 → 329.94] You're the one who never leaves the one behind.
[329.94 → 334.94] All this pain.
[334.94 → 339.94] I wonder if I'll ever find my way.
[339.94 → 348.94] I wonder if my life could really change at all.
[348.94 → 349.94] A little pain.
[349.94 → 355.94] It's not just keeper.
[355.94 → 358.94] I wonder if Shawna an 있는 distance grows does too much.
[358.94 → 359.94] When if I was hoping they'd be, you're Yay.
[359.94 → 361.94] I wonder if there's a piece of issues that would be figured out.
[361.94 → 362.94] But if you weren't feeling if I could see it and try them.
[362.94 → 363.94] What am I?
[363.94 → 364.94] We don't reach the eyes thatriebeneliara24 offers.
[364.94 → 366.94] How can you do you think senile?
[366.94 → 367.94] But I hope that you might want to learn a hope.
[367.94 → 368.94] And have a son that holds your life to the heart.
[368.94 → 373.94] If I am happy god sauce his life and love is able to live.
[373.94 → 374.94] And will all this earth move may not to lean slowly?
[374.94 → 375.94] And can she send them to all our questions?
[375.94 → 387.46] You make beautiful things, you make beautiful things out of the dust.
[387.46 → 399.66] You make beautiful things, you make beautiful things out of us.
[405.94 → 416.26] All around, hope is springing up from this old ground.
[416.26 → 424.54] Out of chaos, life is being found in you.
[424.54 → 439.54] You make beautiful things, you make beautiful things out of the dust.
[439.54 → 451.54] You make beautiful things, you make beautiful things out of us.
[451.54 → 464.54] Oh you make beautiful things, you make beautiful things out of dust.

[581.06 → 590.76] We are uniquely excited to gather in our worship this morning probably for obvious reasons if you are gathered here present with us
[590.76 → 593.98] But we do want to say if you are not yet comfortable

[599.18 → 600.48] We want to encourage you to do that
[600.48 → 606.16] We want to welcome everyone together here so that we can be present as a community
[606.16 → 611.50] We want the gospel to stretch our comfort zones not social anxieties
[611.50 → 616.46] Or other things around that and so let's be present together in the midst of that

[637.94 → 651.36] That excitement notwithstanding again if you're not yet comfortable for sticking around in those kinds of gatherings we welcome you just to head on out
[651.36 → 657.56] And we will live in the midst of all of this together for a little while and so thank you to

[1609.26 → 1614.62] Tell the world of the treasure
[1614.62 → 1630.62] Pair your cross as you wait for the crown
[1630.62 → 1643.62] Tell the world of the treasure you found
[1643.62 → 1645.62] Tell the world of the treasure you found
[1645.62 → 1647.62] And watch the peace of the Lord

[1691.26 → 1696.84] We have an opportunity to commission the Mexico mission team that is going
[1696.84 → 1697.94] And before we do that
[1697.94 → 1699.70] We're going to hear from a couple of them
[1699.70 → 1703.04] As they share with us a little bit about
[1703.04 → 1705.14] Why they're excited for going
[1705.14 → 1710.66] And what they hope to see and hear God do in their midst together
[1710.66 → 1715.82] And so we're going to invite Levi and Ruth to come up to the front
[1715.82 → 1717.98] They're going to take that side stage there
[1717.98 → 1720.74] they're going to share with us for just a few minutes.
[1747.98 → 1763.74] All right, so I'm excited about this trip because we get to continue to build relationships
[1763.74 → 1770.32] with the people down there that we've been doing for the past long while, and especially
[1770.32 → 1774.30] just the time that we're going to spend with the youth down there and the activities that
[1774.30 → 1776.30] we're going to be doing with them.
[1776.30 → 1780.28] And yeah, I'm just really excited to see how God will work through our team and yeah,
[1780.38 → 1781.56] just while we're there.
[1787.06 → 1791.28] So like I think most of you guys here, I have not left the country in two years.
[1791.28 → 1794.06] So to be honest, I'm excited about just that alone.
[1795.26 → 1801.04] But the main thing I'm most excited for is instead of building a house or making a soup
[1801.04 → 1804.00] kitchen like we've done in the past, we haven't gone in two years.
[1804.00 → 1807.98] So just building that relationship, none of us have ever been ourselves except for the
[1807.98 → 1809.98] leaders, except for I guess Leah and the Frontier.
[1809.98 → 1814.52] But yeah, just to build their youth program, I'm really looking forward to seeing that because
[1814.52 → 1816.80] I think we can both learn a lot from each other.
[1816.92 → 1818.54] So just building the relationship again.
[1821.62 → 1822.26] Keep talking?
[1823.20 → 1824.28] I'll keep talking then.
[1824.28 → 1836.80] So honestly, our group has worked decently, if I'm honest.
[1836.80 → 1841.14] We had a task in the beginning where we were given a hockey stick, and we all had to put one
[1841.14 → 1841.70] finger on.
[1842.06 → 1847.26] And the simple task was to put it down on the ground, but no one's finger could go off the
[1847.26 → 1847.60] stick.
[1847.60 → 1852.86] But we had like 10 judges, so they were seeing every single little centimetre of space.
[1853.24 → 1855.96] And we have still not successfully done that yet.
[1856.36 → 1859.20] So maybe we can see if we can get it done down there.
[1859.34 → 1860.92] The kids might beat us, to be honest.
[1860.92 → 1864.68] I still don't think there's much hope for us, but we shall see, I guess.
[1864.68 → 1870.14] All right.
[1870.14 → 1872.44] Did you figure it out for me?
[1894.68 → 1899.56] Figuring that out.
[1902.32 → 1902.92] Keep figuring.
[1902.92 → 1903.82] There it is.
[1904.66 → 1905.06] Beautiful.
[1905.42 → 1906.40] Dave's going to solve the problems.
[1907.26 → 1907.52] All right.
[1907.58 → 1914.66] I want to invite the Mexico mission team, the leaders and everyone, just to come up to the
[1914.66 → 1919.26] front and kind of just come along the front stage here behind the community table so that
[1919.26 → 1921.68] everyone here can see you, everyone on screen can see you.
[1921.68 → 1929.76] And we're going to take a moment and commission them for service and then pray over them in
[1929.76 → 1930.66] that time as well.
[1932.52 → 1940.90] Now, Jesus Christ himself promised that his disciples would never be alone, and he would
[1940.90 → 1942.58] send the spirit to be with them.
[1943.56 → 1949.44] This promise applies to those whose ministry is in familiar places and to those who travel
[1949.44 → 1954.08] far to new settings, whether for a long duration or for a shorter time.
[1954.86 → 1959.88] Today, we rejoice in the calling and the blessing of God on your lives.
[1960.72 → 1966.38] God blesses us with salvation, and then he blesses us with the privilege of partnering and spreading
[1966.38 → 1967.78] his good news.
[1968.26 → 1972.72] And through us, God pours out his blessing on the world.
[1972.72 → 1977.34] Following the apostles, then the church is sent.
[1978.24 → 1983.76] You are sent with the gospel of the kingdom to make disciples of all nations, to feed the
[1983.76 → 1989.46] hungry and proclaim the assurance that in the name of Christ, there is forgiveness of sins
[1989.46 → 1992.84] and new life for all who repent and believe.
[1992.84 → 1999.60] In a world estranged from God where millions face confusing chaos, this mission is central
[1999.60 → 2001.34] to our being as a church.
[2002.00 → 2005.74] For we announce that one name alone saves.
[2007.08 → 2008.94] You go now to Tijuana.
[2009.20 → 2010.10] Did I say that right, Jody?
[2010.54 → 2010.80] No?
[2010.96 → 2011.14] Okay.
[2011.22 → 2011.96] I'm going to work on it.
[2012.16 → 2012.94] And Rosarito.
[2013.68 → 2013.92] Yep.
[2013.96 → 2014.64] Got that one right.
[2014.64 → 2036.40] I want to take this opportunity for family and friends of these people who are here and
[2036.40 → 2038.64] maybe an elder or two of our church.
[2038.64 → 2045.24] Would you come up and lay hands on someone as we pray the power of the spirit into this
[2045.24 → 2046.54] work and mission together?
[2058.12 → 2064.30] For the rest, as you are comfortable and able, we encourage you just to hold up or hold out
[2064.30 → 2072.50] a hand as they too may see that in this community of faith, the Lord goes with them into this
[2072.50 → 2073.38] endeavour.
[2073.90 → 2074.84] Let's pray together.
[2078.98 → 2082.20] Lord, our God, you are so good.
[2082.96 → 2090.00] We see your faithfulness here this morning as we look at all of these individuals and the
[2090.00 → 2094.90] calling that you have placed on their life to send them now to Mexico.
[2095.90 → 2100.84] We see your faithfulness in the community that surrounds them as parents and friends and
[2100.84 → 2106.34] youth leaders, teachers, elders, brothers and sisters in Christ all.
[2106.76 → 2111.30] And so, Lord God, we pray now, bless these with your spirit.
[2112.42 → 2118.06] Move in power in them so that you might move in power through them in all that they do.
[2118.06 → 2122.28] Bless the relationships that they will foster and reconnect.
[2123.04 → 2124.52] Bless the work that will be done.
[2125.84 → 2127.40] May it all be to your glory.
[2128.38 → 2131.18] We pray, Lord God, for safety.
[2132.20 → 2134.80] We pray for challenges.
[2135.72 → 2140.78] We pray for hard circumstances that in the midst of those challenges and hard circumstances,
[2141.08 → 2144.22] there would be ample opportunity to see you at work.
[2144.22 → 2149.18] And so, for each one who goes and for us who stay behind and will hear testimony later,
[2149.48 → 2153.14] we pray for eyes of faith that would see you moving in power.
[2153.62 → 2157.20] Open the eyes of our heart, Lord Jesus, to see you.
[2160.36 → 2166.98] Equip these people now so that they might serve you in faithfulness.
[2166.98 → 2175.82] As you go on this mission together, the Lord bless you and keep you.
[2177.10 → 2180.56] The Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[2181.38 → 2186.56] The Lord turn his face toward you and give you his peace.
[2187.18 → 2189.66] And all the church said, amen.
[2190.72 → 2191.32] Amen.
[2191.54 → 2192.06] God bless.
[2192.06 → 2192.10] God bless.
[2192.10 → 2192.50] Amen.
[2192.50 → 2192.60] God bless.
[2196.98 → 2197.98] Amen.
[2226.98 → 2253.98] You call me out upon the waters, the great unknown.
[2253.98 → 2271.76] God bless.
[2275.76 → 2276.56] Let me say, amen.
[2276.56 → 2281.56] And I will call upon your name.
[2283.38 → 2289.10] And keep my eyes above the waves.
[2289.60 → 2295.56] When oceans rise, my soul will rest in your embrace.
[2295.56 → 2300.68] For I am yours.
[2301.40 → 2305.10] And you are mine.
[2306.56 → 2323.34] Your grace abounds in the deepest waters.
[2323.34 → 2332.22] Your sovereign hand will be my guide.
[2332.22 → 2339.04] Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me.
[2339.76 → 2343.08] You've never failed.
[2343.34 → 2346.70] And you won't start now.
[2346.70 → 2354.66] And I will call upon your name.
[2356.02 → 2361.52] And keep my eyes above the waves.
[2361.52 → 2369.66] When oceans rise, my soul will rest in your embrace.
[2369.66 → 2373.38] For I am yours.
[2374.78 → 2378.26] And you are mine.
[2378.26 → 2381.58] Thank you.
[2381.58 → 2383.00] Thank you.
[2383.00 → 2383.78] Thank you.
[2383.86 → 2393.40] Thank you.
[2393.50 → 2396.14] Thank you.
[2396.14 → 2414.32] Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
[2414.32 → 2418.30] Let me walk upon the waters
[2418.30 → 2423.24] Wherever you would call me
[2423.24 → 2429.82] Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
[2429.82 → 2433.66] And my faith will be made stronger
[2433.66 → 2438.12] In the presence of my Saviour
[2438.12 → 2445.68] Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
[2445.68 → 2449.62] When you walk upon the waters
[2449.62 → 2454.48] Wherever you would call me
[2454.48 → 2460.26] Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
[2460.26 → 2464.56] And my faith will be made stronger
[2464.56 → 2468.84] In the presence of my Saviour
[2468.84 → 2475.84] Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
[2475.84 → 2479.84] Let me walk upon the waters
[2479.84 → 2485.42] Wherever you would call me
[2485.42 → 2491.42] Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
[2491.42 → 2495.42] And my faith will be made stronger
[2495.42 → 2501.42] In the presence of my Saviour
[2501.42 → 2531.40] In the presence of my Saviour
[2531.40 → 2537.98] And I will call upon your name
[2537.98 → 2545.98] Keep my eyes above the waist
[2545.98 → 2550.98] And my soul will rest in your embrace
[2550.98 → 2555.98] I am yours
[2555.98 → 2560.98] And you are mine
[2560.98 → 2564.98] Please be seated
[2564.98 → 2584.42] We continue this morning's worship service
[2584.42 → 2586.30] With the giving of our tithes and offerings
[2586.30 → 2589.58] This morning's offerings is first for our church's budget
[2589.58 → 2592.62] And second for World Renew Ukraine response
[2592.62 → 2597.24] World Renew is actively working with several global networks in the region
[2597.24 → 2599.52] Including the Canadian Food Grains Bank
[2599.52 → 2602.22] To respond to the needs of vulnerable families
[2602.22 → 2604.34] Impacted by the conflict in Ukraine
[2604.34 → 2607.44] World Renew is supporting these organizations
[2607.44 → 2611.64] By providing essential items for people fleeing for safety
[2611.64 → 2612.80] To neighbouring countries
[2612.80 → 2616.50] In Slovakia they are providing temporary shelters
[2616.50 → 2620.32] Emergency food and emergency non-food items
[2620.32 → 2623.14] Such as blankets, linens, mattresses
[2623.14 → 2624.60] And basic hygiene items
[2624.60 → 2626.66] In Romania and Poland
[2626.66 → 2628.60] They are responding with health support
[2628.60 → 2630.02] By supplying health packs
[2630.02 → 2632.22] That will be used by local health centres
[2632.22 → 2635.76] World Renew will continue to support these networks
[2635.76 → 2637.12] As they answer God's call
[2637.12 → 2639.12] To extend love and hope
[2639.12 → 2640.74] To the many people left vulnerable
[2640.74 → 2642.38] By this devastating conflict
[2642.38 → 2645.66] Please consider financially supporting this cause today
[2645.66 → 2648.98] From Ephesians 2 verse 8 to 9
[2648.98 → 2652.38] For it is by grace that you have been saved through faith
[2652.38 → 2654.38] And this is not your own doing
[2654.38 → 2656.16] It is the gift of God
[2656.16 → 2658.12] Not as a result of works
[2658.12 → 2659.82] So that no one may boast
[2659.82 → 2663.10] Next week's offering is for Life Water Canada
[2663.10 → 2664.42] Please give cheerfully
[2664.42 → 2667.32] To the members Vega mother

[2670.98 → 2671.08] For it is for each other
[2671.08 → 2672.46] The people who have been saved
[2672.46 → 2673.02] To the community
[2673.02 → 2674.08] About Funnels
[2674.08 → 2674.76] So that no one may boast

[2688.32 → 2688.96] I
[2688.96 → 2690.72] соп
[2690.72 → 2692.84] Welcome
[2692.84 → 2693.54] Hey
[2693.54 → 2703.64] Come the fount of every blessing, tune my heart to sing thy praise.
[2703.64 → 2714.54] Streams of mercy never ceasing, call for songs of loudest praise.
[2714.54 → 2725.28] Teach me some melodious sonnet, sung by flaming tongues above.
[2725.28 → 2736.62] Praise the mount, I'm fixed upon it, mount of thy redeeming love.
[2744.54 → 2754.92] Here I raise my Ebenezer, hither by thy help I come.
[2754.92 → 2765.98] And I hope by thy good pleasure, safely to arrive at home.
[2765.98 → 2777.16] Jesus sought me when a stranger, wandering from the fold of God.
[2777.72 → 2787.82] Here to rescue me from danger, interposes precious blood.
[2795.98 → 2807.12] Oh, to grace, how great a debtor, daily I'm constrained to be.
[2807.82 → 2818.14] Let thy goodness, like a fetter, bind my wandering heart to thee.
[2818.14 → 2824.10] Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it.
[2824.58 → 2829.14] Prone to leave the God alone.
[2830.04 → 2835.08] Here's my heart, Lord, take and seal it.
[2835.56 → 2843.28] Seal it for thy courts above all else.
[2843.28 → 2854.20] I adore your name above all else.
[2854.20 → 2860.28] Tune my heart to sing your praise.
[2860.28 → 2873.26] Above all else, I adore your name above all else.
[2873.28 → 2903.26] Tune my heart to sing your praise.
[2903.28 → 2909.82] above all else, I adore your name above all else.
[2909.82 → 2918.10] I adore your name above all else.
[2918.10 → 2931.24] Tune my heart to sing your praise.
[2931.24 → 2941.66] Good morning.
[2941.76 → 2944.08] If I could get all the kids up for a quick minute.
[2944.26 → 2945.68] Kids, what are we at?
[2946.18 → 2948.28] Age three to grade four.
[2951.50 → 2952.54] Corey will go fine.
[2953.74 → 2954.66] You were first.
[2961.24 → 2963.84] Hi, guys.
[2964.14 → 2964.82] Welcome to church.
[2964.90 → 2968.40] Isn't it fun to be here without needing to wear masks and stuff?
[2968.46 → 2969.74] Again, I can see all your faces.
[2969.90 → 2970.70] That's kind of exciting.
[2970.88 → 2974.14] It's okay if you still feel like you want to wear a mask in children's worship time, though.
[2974.54 → 2979.80] Hey, I have a personal highlight I want to highlight or share with you before we go off
[2979.80 → 2980.90] to children's worship time.
[2981.46 → 2983.94] My wife got a dog.
[2985.20 → 2985.78] I know.
[2986.56 → 2987.42] Do you guys have dogs?
[2987.48 → 2988.22] Who here has a dog?
[2989.06 → 2990.08] Yeah, just a few dogs.
[2990.08 → 2991.44] Oh, just a few dogs in the group.
[2991.70 → 2992.36] No pets.
[2992.90 → 2993.18] Oh.
[2993.96 → 2994.36] Okay.
[2994.54 → 3000.18] Well, the one thing I will say, there are a lot of things that come with getting a pet that
[3000.18 → 3006.60] I was reticent, I was a little hesitant about, but I will say one big highlight is when you
[3006.60 → 3009.98] come home and your pet is there to greet you.
[3010.56 → 3011.62] Do you guys know what that's like?
[3012.34 → 3012.58] No?
[3012.68 → 3016.18] Maybe when you go to Grandma Grandpa's house or someone else's house, the dog comes running
[3016.18 → 3017.90] to the door, and it's so exciting.
[3017.90 → 3020.32] It's the best thing in the world.
[3020.84 → 3022.88] And the dog just loves seeing you.
[3023.56 → 3023.76] Huh?
[3024.34 → 3025.44] Or, what's that?
[3030.38 → 3030.78] Oh.
[3030.78 → 3035.12] They get pretty excited though, right?
[3035.54 → 3035.88] Yeah.
[3036.32 → 3036.58] Yeah.
[3036.76 → 3037.14] I know.
[3037.20 → 3037.56] You know what?
[3037.58 → 3042.16] These guys are going on a big trip tomorrow, and it's going to be like that when they get
[3042.16 → 3046.86] home, maybe their pet gets super excited that they're home again or maybe their mom and dad
[3046.86 → 3050.38] get super excited that they're home again or their siblings, right?
[3050.38 → 3051.94] I know I have that sometimes.
[3052.08 → 3054.00] My grandma and grandpa, they don't live near here.
[3054.30 → 3062.08] And when I see them, I get a big hug, a big welcome, a big, big kiss on the cheek sometimes,
[3062.42 → 3062.72] right?
[3063.34 → 3064.94] So, we're going to talk about that.
[3065.02 → 3071.46] We're going to talk about being welcomed home and being welcomed into a big hug when we
[3071.46 → 3073.00] get to children's worship time, okay?
[3073.44 → 3075.04] And then I can answer some of your questions.
[3075.04 → 3079.94] But let's stand, and we'll do the children's blessing, and we'll keep our conversation going.
[3082.94 → 3084.36] Let's raise our hands.
[3086.82 → 3089.04] The Lord is here.
[3089.84 → 3091.40] And also is here.
[3105.04 → 3120.84] Hello, my name is Peter, and I am one of the elders here at Founder Church.
[3121.46 → 3125.16] And it's my privilege to lead you this morning in our congregational prayer.
[3125.82 → 3128.98] So, please bow your heads with me and let's go to our God in prayer.
[3128.98 → 3138.88] Father in heaven, how great it is to come to you this day.
[3140.44 → 3145.52] We praise you, Lord, when it comes out easy and when we're on top of the world.
[3146.16 → 3151.58] We praise you, Lord, when the world is resting on our shoulders, it feels, and when it seems
[3151.58 → 3152.08] too hard.
[3152.08 → 3160.44] In the middle of the joys of life or in the long dark night, we know that Jesus Christ
[3160.44 → 3161.46] is our Saviour.
[3163.04 → 3167.68] We are all in the middle of all these types of feelings coming at us all at once.
[3168.64 → 3172.38] We are constantly in some precedent-setting situation.
[3172.70 → 3178.36] And even though there are things to celebrate, this can all be very taxing, especially emotionally
[3178.36 → 3179.00] and spiritually.
[3179.00 → 3185.46] Lord, be our guide through what seems to be a yo-yo of emotions.
[3187.02 → 3189.72] Father, we think of the war being fought over in Ukraine right now.
[3190.30 → 3194.02] It's right in our face on social media and all over.
[3195.42 → 3197.82] Wars and uprisings seem to happen quite a lot.
[3198.72 → 3203.16] But when two European countries are at war, it does seem a little more serious.
[3203.70 → 3205.50] And countries around the world are reacting.
[3205.50 → 3212.48] Our prayer, Lord, is for peace and an end to this war that's causing massive death and
[3212.48 → 3213.10] devastation.
[3216.40 → 3222.96] Father, also overseas, we think of Jared right now, who is in Costa Rica.
[3223.16 → 3228.32] And we're thankful for the work that he is doing there and that he is blessed by that
[3228.32 → 3232.36] work and keeping on going and enjoying it there.
[3232.36 → 3239.24] We're also thankful that the Mexico mission team, after a couple of years' hiatus, is now
[3239.24 → 3245.78] able to go down again to Mexico and minister there and be part of the community and probably
[3245.78 → 3249.30] have to reestablish some more relationships there or keep them going, Lord.
[3249.34 → 3251.26] And we're thankful for the group that is going.
[3251.68 → 3254.18] And may there be a blessing to the people there.
[3254.18 → 3261.02] Closer to home, Lord, we're thankful for a positive change in the pandemic restrictions.
[3262.06 → 3267.18] It doesn't seem that we'll be done with this virus that has swept across the world very
[3267.18 → 3270.96] quickly, but we are thankful for the changes we've seen.
[3272.16 → 3276.14] Our government and health officials have been in our prayers constantly as they navigate this
[3276.14 → 3279.72] situation and try to do what they think is best for those they govern.
[3279.72 → 3289.82] Lord, may we be thoughtful and patient for those who, after two years, are still not quite
[3289.82 → 3292.86] so comfortable, Lord, and are venturing out.
[3293.36 → 3299.08] And help us to support them as we all navigate this change.
[3300.38 → 3305.22] Lord, we celebrate along with Matt and Nicole and their families as they were married yesterday.
[3305.60 → 3308.52] Bless the union, Lord, and lead them in their marriage.
[3308.52 → 3316.64] Lord, let us not also forget those and those people who we may not see mentioned in our
[3316.64 → 3318.22] bulletin or midweek memo.
[3320.54 → 3323.66] There are people every day going through struggles and trials of some sort.
[3324.26 → 3327.88] Help us to be a support to these people if they reach out to us.
[3328.32 → 3331.58] And Lord, we grant that your presence be with them, hold them, and care for them.
[3332.76 → 3337.26] Lord, on our prayer list in the church bulletin, we quote James, where he says to pray for
[3337.26 → 3338.84] each other.
[3338.84 → 3342.42] And that verse also highlights that our prayers be earnest.
[3343.20 → 3347.14] Help the life of the church and the world around us to always be in our prayers.
[3347.80 → 3349.74] And may prayer be a growing part of our lives.
[3351.12 → 3353.46] Father, bless the word that was preached here today.
[3354.00 → 3356.02] Be with Pastor Chris as he delivers us the message.
[3356.66 → 3361.60] Open our ears, our minds, and our souls to hear this message for us today.
[3361.60 → 3362.98] Amen.
[3362.98 → 3363.06] Amen.
[3363.06 → 3363.10] Amen.
[3391.60 → 3392.60] Amen.
[3395.10 → 3395.54] Amen.
[3395.54 → 3397.10] This one.
[3397.20 → 3397.42] Okay.
[3397.42 → 3397.56] Amen.
[3401.10 → 3402.06] Alright.
[3402.50 → 3413.62] We are going to continue in our worship and looking and reading through the book of Exodus
[3413.62 → 3414.14] together.
[3414.84 → 3420.46] I'm going to read just three verses this morning from Exodus 23.
[3421.26 → 3425.38] I'm going to read from verse 14 through to 17,
[3425.38 → 3429.72] and then we'll spend some time reflecting on that together.
[3430.28 → 3434.58] With God's word open, let's read together.
[3436.58 → 3440.74] Three times a year you are to celebrate a festival to me.
[3440.74 → 3444.34] Celebrate the festival of unleavened bread.
[3444.84 → 3448.44] For seven days eat bread made without yeast, as I commanded you.
[3449.50 → 3452.56] Do this at the appointed time in the month of Aviv.
[3453.48 → 3455.98] For in that month you came out of Egypt.
[3457.40 → 3460.82] No one is to appear before me empty-handed.
[3462.20 → 3467.24] Celebrate the festival of harvest with the first fruits of the crops you sow in your field.
[3467.24 → 3474.56] Celebrate the festival of ingathering at the end of the year when you gather in your crops from the field.
[3475.58 → 3481.52] Three times a year all the men are to appear before the sovereign Lord.
[3482.76 → 3484.08] This is the word of the Lord.
[3484.08 → 3494.30] Now when you wake up every morning, what is the very first thing that you do?
[3498.50 → 3499.72] Smack the alarm clock?
[3499.96 → 3501.68] Yeah, once or twice or thrice.
[3502.42 → 3505.30] The very first thing some of you do is think about coffee.
[3505.30 → 3516.50] I wager the very first thing you do after opening your eyes or smacking the alarm for many of you, perhaps even most of you, is grab your phone.
[3518.50 → 3519.42] Turn it on.
[3520.04 → 3520.84] What did I miss?
[3520.84 → 3528.86] Now I'd like to say that when I grab my phone, the first thing I do is open my news app and go to read the news, but really I go to Instagram.
[3530.36 → 3532.66] And see what fun parties I missed.
[3533.42 → 3537.98] And what didn't happen, or did happen, that I wasn't able to be part of.
[3539.08 → 3542.04] Or maybe you're a better person than I am.
[3543.08 → 3543.82] Probably are.
[3543.82 → 3547.76] And so that's not the first thing you do in the morning when you wake up.
[3548.12 → 3552.40] But when your phone dings, what do you do?
[3554.16 → 3555.08] You look at it.
[3556.28 → 3556.64] Right?
[3556.70 → 3557.94] You could be talking to someone.
[3558.74 → 3565.22] Maybe you're a teenager and mom and dad are trying to have a conversation with you, but then all of a sudden the text notification goes off and you look.
[3565.94 → 3566.84] You just do it.
[3567.92 → 3570.64] Now, parents, let me explain this to you.
[3570.64 → 3580.32] There's a thing that has happened in the brains of people, okay, that short circuits that critical faculty of, like, being respectful.
[3581.70 → 3582.22] Right?
[3582.28 → 3583.56] No, I'm not kidding.
[3583.98 → 3598.36] There are neuropath ways in the brain that have been developed over our use of technology and phones that circumvents the frontal lobe or the critical faculty part of our brain that when we hear that ding, it's like an animal instinct.
[3598.36 → 3599.30] We grab it and we look.
[3599.30 → 3600.30] We look.
[3600.30 → 3604.72] And it takes conscious effort to not do it, but subconscious effort to do it.
[3605.64 → 3606.70] Neuroscientists have mapped this out.
[3606.78 → 3609.38] You can see the things firing on the brain as it goes through.
[3610.12 → 3611.06] Why do we do it?
[3611.68 → 3613.10] Well, because we've always done it.
[3613.10 → 3619.68] And our brain has just been conditioned to do it, and it's now physiologically reflecting that condition.
[3621.44 → 3629.86] The habit has become sort of concretized in our physiology.
[3629.86 → 3638.06] It's become real because we've done it over and over and over again.
[3638.56 → 3641.80] This morning I want to talk to you about the power of habits.
[3641.80 → 3645.66] The power of habits.
[3645.76 → 3649.08] When my kids were little, we would read Bernstein Bear books.
[3650.06 → 3651.38] Some of you are familiar with this.
[3651.72 → 3654.18] There's a Bernstein Bear book called Bad Habits.
[3654.18 → 3659.50] And in there, Mama Bear gives an excellent illustration of how habits are formed.
[3659.60 → 3664.28] She is explaining to Sister Bear, you can tell what age my kids are, right?
[3664.28 → 3671.22] That when you do something over and over and over again, you create like grooves in a road.
[3671.64 → 3676.32] Mama Bear was talking about the wheelbarrow that she pushed down the lane way for gardening every year.
[3676.72 → 3679.70] And the grooves got deeper and deeper and deeper.
[3679.94 → 3683.08] And it almost, she didn't have to steer that wheelbarrow anymore.
[3683.24 → 3687.10] It just went in that direction because the grooves have been created in that place.
[3687.42 → 3688.76] That's the power of habit.
[3688.76 → 3693.40] That grooves get created in our lives.
[3693.48 → 3697.48] These well-worn grooves that steer us along.
[3698.40 → 3702.92] This section of the book of Exodus, where we have been reading and spending our time,
[3703.70 → 3708.42] God is sharing with his people how life should look.
[3709.34 → 3713.08] It started with the Ten Commandments, the beginning of chapter 20,
[3713.08 → 3717.84] and then in one form or another, it carries on through the end of the book.
[3718.76 → 3719.22] Right?
[3719.26 → 3726.20] There's really only just a little bit of like narrative or story left in this book.
[3726.40 → 3732.64] The rest is how shall you live in relationship to God and in relationship to each other.
[3733.18 → 3739.46] Now, I think it's important to remember and to be reminded last week when we ended and landed
[3739.46 → 3743.86] that God is talking to his chosen people, right?
[3743.86 → 3751.48] These are his people, his holy nation, his people whom he has called and carried out of Egypt in the Exodus, right?
[3751.58 → 3759.76] We are not yet or at least not precisely in the realm of sort of universal categorical imperatives.
[3759.92 → 3761.68] They're there, and they're coming.
[3761.68 → 3771.50] But using the text that we read this week as an example, God isn't telling the Egyptians to celebrate these three festivals.
[3772.10 → 3773.34] He's telling the Israelites.
[3773.34 → 3782.52] And in a sense, what we are seeing is a working out or a sort of structural assumption of,
[3783.22 → 3786.16] and I had this conversation with some of you this past week coming out of last week,
[3786.58 → 3788.90] of this idea called principled pluralism.
[3789.72 → 3791.32] Now, that's not a phrase I expect you to remember.
[3791.46 → 3798.18] It's a phrase that Abraham Kuiper, a Reformed theologian, politician, used at the beginning of the 20th century.
[3798.18 → 3806.66] The point is, the idea is that we as Christians must be thoroughly convicted of the right and good way to live,
[3806.86 → 3813.94] but also we must allow for and find ways to encourage people with radically different confessions
[3813.94 → 3821.92] about the right way and the good way to live to be also thoroughly convicted and to act out of those convictions, right?
[3821.92 → 3829.20] Neither secular humanism nor Christianity must be given priority of place in a pluralistic society.
[3829.44 → 3838.72] Both must have equal opportunity to make a compelling and, I would say, compassionate case for life together, right?
[3838.78 → 3844.62] People who operate out of either assumption or whatever other assumptions there may be about how life is supposed to be lived
[3844.62 → 3846.38] must have the freedom to do so.
[3846.38 → 3855.46] Likewise, neither should we sort of legislate the other into obscurity or relegation to what some might call the private sphere.
[3856.40 → 3859.52] Now, this is a sort of foundational principle of reform, social order,
[3859.60 → 3864.40] and I invite you to reflect on that more later or to have conversations with me about that more later,
[3864.48 → 3869.32] but just recognize that that idea is what is behind this conversation.
[3869.32 → 3878.74] For now, though, God is talking to his people about the rhythms of their life together.
[3879.58 → 3890.12] We're talking about social and religious rhythms that affect the pace of life lived in relationship to God.
[3890.12 → 3896.58] So in the section immediately preceding what we read, if your Bibles are open, you will see it there,
[3897.26 → 3900.76] the sort of Sabbath rhythms are reiterated.
[3901.12 → 3903.08] Remember the Sabbath command, right?
[3903.18 → 3905.14] Six days you shall labour and do all your work.
[3905.26 → 3912.50] Sabbath is a Hebrew word play on the word for sixth or seventh, sorry, in the seventh day you rest.
[3912.50 → 3923.22] Now, we'll look explicitly at Sabbath in a couple of weeks, but for now, just notice the rhythm of it, right, in verse 10.
[3924.56 → 3929.88] Six years you shall sow the land, the seventh leave is fallow, right?
[3929.92 → 3933.80] And then for six days do your work, but the seventh does not work.
[3934.58 → 3942.00] And then we read there, so that you may be refreshed at the end of verse 12, right?
[3942.00 → 3948.94] The purpose of this rhythm is for refreshment, refreshment for the land and refreshment for the worker.
[3949.74 → 3954.26] The rhythm of practice comes out again, then, in the text that we read.
[3954.98 → 3958.82] Three times a year celebrate this festival.
[3959.44 → 3965.98] Now, the first festival in the month of Aviv is, and that takes place sometimes in our month of March or April,
[3966.34 → 3971.48] depending on which calendar year it is, celebrate the festival of unleavened bread.
[3972.00 → 3975.00] Now, this is connected to the Passover experience.
[3975.42 → 3983.54] Maybe you remember that story when they had to make bread without yeast as an expression of the haste in which they had to leave Egypt,
[3983.76 → 3990.76] right, after the angel of the Lord passed over them when they took refuge under the blood of the lamb painted on their doorposts.
[3990.80 → 3998.10] This becomes a community festival and a celebration of God's deliverance of his people out of Egypt.
[3998.10 → 4000.84] They were to do this at the beginning of the year.
[4001.46 → 4007.18] The second festival, the Feast of Harvest, is sometimes called the Feast of Weeks,
[4007.34 → 4010.68] and it's held seven weeks after that first festival.
[4011.36 → 4019.28] Now, if you do the math, you might recognize the more common name of this festival that we know in the Christian tradition.
[4019.28 → 4022.40] It's called Pentecost, right?
[4022.52 → 4024.98] Seven days, or seven weeks, 50 days.
[4025.70 → 4028.04] Pentecost is Greek for 50th.
[4028.88 → 4035.68] This is the celebration of the first fruits of the harvest, the first crop to be gathered.
[4035.76 → 4038.44] It's a symbol of the harvest that is to come.
[4039.28 → 4046.48] It is a tangible expression of what is as yet in the future, but you can be sure that it is coming.
[4046.48 → 4055.10] Now, the little bits of this harvest represent the lot that's going to come later.
[4056.18 → 4061.04] And the final festival, the festival of ingathering, comes at the end of the year.
[4062.00 → 4071.88] It's sometimes called the festival of booths because it symbolizes Israel living in temporary shelters during their wandering period.
[4072.72 → 4075.66] And ingathering is the sort of final harvest.
[4075.66 → 4084.40] Throughout the Bible, this festival is tied to the Israelites coming into the land and then the land being productive, right?
[4084.46 → 4087.38] In the land, they can plant and they can plant roots.
[4088.18 → 4098.16] They can be around long enough for a full harvest of crops to come and then to establish themselves and culture and history and presence.
[4098.16 → 4108.66] What we're recognizing in the festival or what they're asked to be recognized in the festival is that the ability of the land to produce is a gift of God.
[4109.36 → 4109.76] Right?
[4109.86 → 4112.84] And really, it's all a gift of God.
[4112.84 → 4119.66] The point of this festival is everything you have is from God.
[4120.66 → 4121.04] Right?
[4121.06 → 4123.60] It's a celebration of our daily bread.
[4124.16 → 4125.04] We sometimes pray.
[4125.44 → 4125.58] Right?
[4125.62 → 4130.30] It's a Thanksgiving for God's gifts to all his people.
[4130.30 → 4140.32] In a sense, the people use this festival to look around at all that God is doing for them and with them and through them.
[4140.32 → 4143.96] And they count their blessings as they look.
[4145.86 → 4155.04] And so these three festivals, these three rhythms of life, look back, they look forward, and they look around.
[4155.04 → 4162.82] Unleavened bread, harvest, and ingathering, back, forward, and around.
[4164.22 → 4168.06] That is the rhythm of a worshipping life.
[4169.96 → 4173.68] That is the rhythm of life with God.
[4174.34 → 4177.78] Look back at the deliverance accomplished by God in Jesus.
[4177.78 → 4187.12] Look forward to the hope that is promised of the kingdom come in its fullness, just like the festival of first fruits and harvest.
[4187.38 → 4187.50] Right?
[4187.54 → 4192.72] We already have a little taste of that, but we look forward to its full fulfillment.
[4193.32 → 4201.48] And then look around you at your present circumstances, seeing God's work in providing for we, his people.
[4201.48 → 4202.74] Right?
[4202.78 → 4216.66] This rhythm is why it makes sense for the Apostle Paul in the New Testament, in 1 Corinthians, to talk about Jesus' resurrection as the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.
[4217.34 → 4217.46] Right?
[4217.54 → 4223.20] Jesus' resurrection is the tangible, concrete evidence of the full harvest to come.
[4223.42 → 4223.62] Right?
[4223.66 → 4225.62] The resurrection of all who believe.
[4227.14 → 4231.04] In a minute, we're going to participate in the Lord's Supper.
[4231.48 → 4238.16] And this is a meal that is, in our imaginations, obviously connected to the Passover festival.
[4238.58 → 4238.72] Right?
[4238.74 → 4241.74] Not just because that's when Jesus instituted it.
[4241.98 → 4242.12] Right?
[4242.18 → 4244.64] He was coming with his disciples to celebrate Passover.
[4245.00 → 4249.20] But because in it, we proclaim the Lord's death until he comes again.
[4250.20 → 4250.74] Right?
[4250.78 → 4255.34] In this supper, we look back, and we remember God's deliverance.
[4255.34 → 4262.90] But at the same time, this table anticipates the table of the eternal banquet of the King.
[4263.38 → 4263.58] Right?
[4263.62 → 4267.06] The table to come so that we can look forward to that day.
[4267.06 → 4276.64] And again, this table is a table where the body of Jesus takes in the body of Jesus.
[4277.00 → 4289.26] Where we, as brothers and sisters in Christ, a new type of family, come so that we can look around at the context of our faith lived in the world,
[4289.50 → 4294.82] nourished by the spiritual presence of Christ available in the bread and the wine.
[4294.82 → 4301.40] The table is a looking back and a looking forward and a looking around.
[4301.58 → 4305.06] The table is a rhythm of faith.
[4306.20 → 4306.72] Right?
[4306.76 → 4310.74] It's a rhythm of faith in a nice, neat, and tidy package.
[4311.02 → 4313.80] But our rhythm of worship is the same.
[4314.22 → 4314.38] Right?
[4314.38 → 4317.18] Every Lord's Day, and for us, that's Sunday.
[4317.64 → 4322.02] But to be honest, the particular day doesn't actually matter all that much to me.
[4322.10 → 4323.68] It's the rhythm of it.
[4324.08 → 4324.88] Now, don't get me wrong.
[4325.12 → 4325.26] Right?
[4325.88 → 4330.70] There's value in being connected to the history of the Christian tradition that worships on Sunday.
[4330.84 → 4337.54] There is theological value in being connected to Sunday as the day that Jesus was resurrected from the dead and us gathering.
[4337.54 → 4343.80] But if you're part of a church that rents a facility and all you have is Saturday night together, awesome.
[4344.42 → 4345.06] Do it.
[4345.72 → 4345.86] Right?
[4345.88 → 4352.82] If you're a shift worker and Sundays are just ruled out of your opportunity to worship, but Wednesday is the day that you can catch the live stream,
[4352.88 → 4359.30] or Wednesday is the day that you get together with your care group and that's your meaningful experience of the body, awesome.
[4359.88 → 4360.28] Perfect.
[4360.44 → 4362.94] It's the rhythm that matters most.
[4362.94 → 4371.76] It's the priority of rhythm and the ritual of worship in encountering Jesus.
[4372.46 → 4372.60] Right?
[4372.68 → 4385.68] Again, in looking back, looking ahead, and looking around through a lens now focused on the work of God in the world in a general way and in your life in particular.
[4385.68 → 4392.24] And these rhythms practice with weekly repetition.
[4392.94 → 4397.16] These rhythms nuanced with different daily additions.
[4397.76 → 4400.16] Or maybe you read your Bible and pray every day.
[4400.24 → 4401.36] Or you're part of a Bible study.
[4401.44 → 4402.32] Or you fast.
[4402.86 → 4404.38] A regular occurrence.
[4405.16 → 4405.28] Right?
[4405.32 → 4410.68] And then every once in a while, maybe you add in one of these bigger celebrations or these bigger activities.
[4410.68 → 4414.08] Like three times a year community festival of worship.
[4414.08 → 4417.10] Or like a mission trip to Mexico.
[4417.10 → 4421.58] Or like six months with Cape and Ray in Costa Rica.
[4421.58 → 4424.46] Or two years with SWAM in Indonesia.
[4424.46 → 4428.02] Or a summer on the South Coast Beach Project in Ontario.
[4428.02 → 4432.52] Or a retreat into the interior with a canoe and a backpack and a Bible.
[4433.02 → 4434.04] And you go.
[4434.04 → 4444.40] These rhythms can become to you like mornings with your phone.
[4444.78 → 4447.56] Or to me, like mornings with my phone if you're better than I.
[4448.20 → 4448.40] Right?
[4448.44 → 4449.36] You just do it.
[4450.00 → 4451.54] You don't think about it.
[4452.28 → 4455.96] In fact, it feels weird and unnatural when you don't do it.
[4455.98 → 4456.08] Right?
[4456.10 → 4457.32] And some of you know what I mean here.
[4457.32 → 4460.00] You start your day with Bible reading and with prayer.
[4460.16 → 4463.66] And on the mornings that you miss it, for whatever reason, the day feels off.
[4464.44 → 4465.80] The whole day feels strange.
[4466.88 → 4472.18] And look, I'm not trying to create a new legalism here.
[4472.28 → 4477.26] I'm not trying to burden you with a new sense of overwhelming responsibility.
[4477.68 → 4479.06] In fact, quite the opposite.
[4479.74 → 4486.10] Right here, I am talking about the formative power of spiritual, of religious habit.
[4486.10 → 4489.74] of doing something over and over and over again.
[4490.02 → 4492.84] And that has an impact on you.
[4493.94 → 4494.72] And hear what I said there.
[4495.10 → 4499.64] Doing something over and over again has an impact on you.
[4500.02 → 4503.44] You don't do it over and over again so that it has an impact on you.
[4504.10 → 4506.72] It has an impact on you.
[4507.60 → 4512.32] Let me make an analogy that some of you will realize hits pretty close to home.
[4512.32 → 4518.34] I did a sort of soft social experiment on myself a couple of years ago.
[4519.10 → 4530.22] For a period of time, all I ever listened to on the radio or on podcasts was conservative news heads and conservative theological speakers.
[4530.22 → 4546.42] And over that period of time, and it wasn't a long one actually, the very words that I would use regularly, the very phrases that I would parrot back in conversation were not my own, but they were those of those talking heads that I would listen to.
[4546.42 → 4553.62] Right? The thoughts in my own head took the form of the ideas and the ideologies that I heard.
[4554.58 → 4564.66] Now, seeing the impact of that and reflecting on my own self and my own self awareness, I switched courses as part of this sort of self social experiment.
[4564.66 → 4571.12] And so for a period of time, all I listened to was progressive news heads and progressive theological speakers.
[4571.34 → 4572.96] And the exact same thing happened.
[4573.72 → 4580.30] Right? Over time, my language, my thoughts, and my ideas took the form of what I was being exposed to.
[4583.42 → 4584.60] I still see it.
[4584.60 → 4591.80] If I'm reading a good book, right, parts of it or the language that it uses will make its way into my preaching.
[4591.80 → 4593.82] Right? Not by conscious effort.
[4593.82 → 4594.92] It just happens.
[4594.92 → 4600.52] In fact, I can tell you that right now I'm reading a book about Abraham Kuiper and his impact on the secular age.
[4600.52 → 4601.88] Do you remember who I quoted earlier?
[4601.88 → 4605.00] Abraham Kuiper and his impact on the secular age.
[4605.00 → 4613.40] Now, I say this not to offer social or political commentary.
[4613.40 → 4619.60] But just to say that whatever you put in is what comes out.
[4619.60 → 4634.64] No matter how high functioning your critical faculties may be, the rhythm and ritual of repeated exposure gets past your head and into your heart.
[4636.08 → 4640.72] And so what you put in matters.
[4640.72 → 4650.80] What rhythms you keep creating those deep grooves of cognition and behaviour.
[4650.80 → 4656.84] The rhythms of six days working and the seventh day off.
[4656.84 → 4659.60] The rhythms of a seven-year sabbatical.
[4659.60 → 4662.36] The rhythms of three times a year festival.
[4662.36 → 4666.68] All have a power to shape us.
[4666.68 → 4675.00] This is the form and the formative power of religious habit.
[4675.00 → 4678.04] And so let me ask you.
[4678.04 → 4680.24] What are your rhythms?
[4680.24 → 4683.64] What are your habits?
[4683.64 → 4687.40] And how are they shaping you?
[4687.40 → 4688.40] Right?
[4688.40 → 4689.40] Right?
[4689.40 → 4697.68] And if you have it in your capacity this morning and over this next week, how are they unconsciously shaping you?
[4697.68 → 4710.52] And so for something to do this week, what well-worn grooves are you actually shaping?
[4710.52 → 4714.26] What intentions are you bringing?
[4714.44 → 4718.92] What rhythms are you creating in your life?
[4718.92 → 4725.04] And are they drawing you nearer to God and to his church?
[4725.04 → 4733.90] Or are they drawing you nearer to something or someone else and away from his church?
[4733.90 → 4738.90] 1 Timothy 4.
[4738.90 → 4740.14] Paul says to Timothy.
[4740.14 → 4742.90] Now remember, Timothy is Paul's young protégé.
[4742.90 → 4750.06] And he's trying to train him up in the faith to be a good and strong leader in the Christian church.
[4750.06 → 4752.02] Paul says to Timothy,
[4752.02 → 4756.10] Have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives' tales.
[4756.10 → 4760.54] Rather, train yourself to be godly.
[4761.74 → 4763.66] For physical training is of some value.
[4763.90 → 4767.74] But godliness has a value for all things.
[4767.74 → 4772.66] Holding promise for both the present life and the life to come.
[4772.66 → 4775.02] What is Paul saying here?
[4777.02 → 4781.94] Training yourself in the faith takes work.
[4783.06 → 4791.64] Living obediently in relationship to God in Jesus Christ is a discipline and a matter of discipline.
[4791.64 → 4796.64] Godliness has value for all things.
[4796.64 → 4803.42] What rhythms and habits are giving value for all things in your life?
[4803.42 → 4814.58] If you were here yesterday at the wedding or if you know the text that Matt and Nicole had us reflect on,
[4814.58 → 4818.42] It's from 1 Thessalonians 5, 16 to 18.
[4818.42 → 4820.74] It says, Rejoice always.
[4820.74 → 4822.74] Pray continually.
[4822.74 → 4826.70] Give thanks in all circumstances.
[4826.70 → 4830.58] For this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.
[4830.58 → 4833.98] Look back.
[4834.22 → 4836.14] Look forward.
[4836.14 → 4837.14] Look forward.
[4837.14 → 4838.14] And look around.
[4838.14 → 4838.18] Look around.
[4838.18 → 4843.02] These are the rhythms of the Christian life.
[4844.90 → 4849.98] So let's come to the table so that we can look back and see Jesus.
[4849.98 → 4855.54] Let's come to the table so that we can look ahead and see the promise of his kingdom come and kingdom coming.
[4855.54 → 4861.78] And let's come to the table so that we can look around and see brothers and sisters in Christ
[4861.78 → 4864.36] and know that we are not alone.
[4864.50 → 4866.90] To know that we are part of this kingdom.
[4867.06 → 4872.24] To know that God himself has granted us and given us new life.
[4872.24 → 4880.88] We come together so that we can go into this week to live out of these shared rhythms.
[4882.88 → 4885.54] Let's come to the table.
[4886.20 → 4887.24] Let me pray with you.
[4891.74 → 4900.40] Lord Jesus, as we come to this table, we pray that here we might look back and see you.
[4900.40 → 4904.64] We pray that here that we might look forward and see you.
[4904.78 → 4912.12] We pray that here we might look around and see you in the faces of our brothers and sisters of faith.
[4914.10 → 4916.86] Nourish our hearts in these rhythms.
[4917.54 → 4918.38] Shape us.
[4919.10 → 4925.42] Transform us by the renewing of our mind as this is our spiritual act of worship.
[4928.42 → 4930.18] We come, Lord God.
[4930.40 → 4934.90] Waiting to encounter you.
[4936.36 → 4937.52] Come, Lord God.
[4937.62 → 4941.74] Waiting for you to meet us here.
[4943.12 → 4947.82] And so, Lord, meet us at the table.
[4948.78 → 4949.90] In your name we pray.
[4950.80 → 4951.12] Amen.
[4951.12 → 4951.28] Amen.
[4951.28 → 4951.30] Amen.
[4960.40 → 4968.92] This next song that we're going to sing as a song of response is new to us.
[4969.16 → 4969.86] It's new to me.
[4970.62 → 4974.78] But it is based on the Psalm 130.
[4975.36 → 4978.22] And so, we invite you to listen and join in as you are able.
[4978.22 → 4989.16] And please rise.
[4989.16 → 5010.78] Out of the depths I cry to you.
[5010.78 → 5017.10] In darkest places I will call.
[5017.10 → 5023.10] Incline your ear to me anew.
[5023.10 → 5029.10] And hear my cry for mercy, Lord.
[5029.10 → 5035.10] Were you to count my sinful ways.
[5035.10 → 5041.10] How could I come before your throne?
[5041.10 → 5047.10] Yet full forgiveness meets my face.
[5047.10 → 5053.10] I stand redeemed by grace alone.
[5053.10 → 5059.10] I will wait for you.
[5059.10 → 5065.10] On your word I will rely on.
[5065.10 → 5067.10] I will wait for you.
[5067.10 → 5069.10] Surely wait for you.
[5069.10 → 5073.10] Till my soul is satisfied.
[5073.10 → 5083.10] So put your hope in God alone.
[5083.10 → 5093.10] Decoupaging his power to stay.
[5093.10 → 5103.10] Completely and forever one.
[5103.10 → 5105.10] By Christ emerging from the grave.
[5105.10 → 5107.10] By Christ emerging from the grave.
[5107.10 → 5110.10] I will wait for you.
[5110.10 → 5114.10] I will wait for you.
[5114.10 → 5115.10] I will wait for you.
[5115.10 → 5119.10] On your word I will rely on.
[5119.10 → 5129.10] I will wait for you, surely wait for you, till my soul is satisfied.
[5129.10 → 5154.30] Fast love has made a way, and God himself has paid the price, that all who trust in him today, find healing in his sacrifice.
[5154.30 → 5166.74] I will wait for you, I will wait for you, through the storm and through the night.
[5166.74 → 5177.80] I will wait for you, surely wait for you, for your love is my delight.
[5184.30 → 5187.98] Do you in genial boat?
[5187.98 → 5192.38] Am Iвод?
[5192.38 → 5218.40] You may go ahead and have a seat.
[5218.40 → 5218.92] Thank you.
[5222.38 → 5232.26] At his last supper, the Lord Jesus, he took bread.
[5233.46 → 5237.26] And when he had given thanks, he broke it, and he said,
[5237.26 → 5241.48] This is my body, which is for you.
[5243.94 → 5247.68] Do this in remembrance of me.
[5247.68 → 5253.00] And in the same way, after supper, he took the cup, and he said,
[5253.24 → 5256.26] This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[5256.92 → 5259.54] Do this in remembrance of me.
[5259.68 → 5263.08] For whenever we eat this bread and drink this cup,
[5263.20 → 5266.86] we proclaim the Lord's death until he comes again.
[5266.86 → 5274.42] Therefore, we proclaim our faith as signed and sealed in this sacrament.
[5274.42 → 5289.06] Church family, the Lord has prepared his table for all who love him
[5289.06 → 5292.32] and who trust in him alone for their salvation.
[5293.38 → 5296.94] And so come to this table.
[5296.94 → 5304.88] Come to this table.
[5304.88 → 5304.90] Come to this table.
[5304.90 → 5304.92] Come to this table.
[5304.92 → 5310.44] You who have been to this sacrament often and you who have not been for a long time.
[5311.70 → 5312.80] Come to this table.
[5312.94 → 5317.10] You who have tried to follow Jesus and you who have failed.
[5317.10 → 5319.10] Come to this table.
[5319.10 → 5323.90] Come to this table if you are here or if you are at home.
[5325.02 → 5331.06] It is Christ himself who invites us to meet him here.
[5331.56 → 5334.66] And so come to the table.
[5335.66 → 5339.60] The gifts of God for the people of God.
[5347.10 → 5377.08] You who have been to this table.
[5377.10 → 5407.08] You who have been to this table.
[5407.08 → 5409.08] Jesus Christ.
[5409.08 → 5414.08] I love the Holy Lamb of God.
[5414.08 → 5420.22] Oh, wash me in his precious blood.
[5420.70 → 5422.08] My Jesus Christ.
[5422.86 → 5426.38] The Lamb of God.
[5426.38 → 5433.90] Your gift of love they crucified
[5433.90 → 5439.90] They laughed and scorned him as he died
[5440.68 → 5445.90] The humble king they named a fraud
[5446.48 → 5451.90] And sacrificed the Lamb of God
[5451.90 → 5458.26] O Lamb of God, sweet Lamb of God
[5458.26 → 5463.92] I love the holy Lamb of God
[5463.92 → 5469.72] O wash me in his precious blood
[5469.72 → 5475.66] My Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God
[5475.66 → 5484.02] I was so lost, I should have died
[5484.02 → 5491.02] But you have brought me to your side
[5491.02 → 5497.12] To be led by your staff and rod
[5497.12 → 5503.36] And to be called the Lamb of God
[5503.36 → 5509.02] O Lamb of God, sweet Lamb of God
[5509.02 → 5514.80] I love the holy Lamb of God
[5514.80 → 5520.66] O wash me in his precious blood
[5520.66 → 5526.68] My Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God
[5526.68 → 5532.40] O Lamb of God, sweet Lamb of God
[5532.40 → 5538.12] I love the holy Lamb of God
[5538.12 → 5543.84] O wash me in his precious blood
[5543.84 → 5550.12] My Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God
[5550.12 → 5562.98] The body of Christ given for you
[5562.98 → 5566.42] So take, eat, remember and believe
[5566.42 → 5567.96] that the body of Jesus Christ was given
[5567.96 → 5570.14] for the complete and absolute forgiveness
[5570.14 → 5572.38] of all our sins
[5572.38 → 5602.36] And to be called the Lamb of God
[5602.38 → 5632.36] O Lord, sweet Lamb of God
[5632.36 → 5634.36] How beautiful
[5634.36 → 5662.34] The Lamb of God
[5662.34 → 5679.02] How beautiful, how beautiful is the body of Christ.
[5679.02 → 5695.02] How beautiful, how beautiful the heart that bled, that took all my sin and bore it instead.
[5695.02 → 5709.28] How beautiful, the tender eyes that chose to forgive and never despise.
[5709.28 → 5731.12] How beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful is the body of Christ.
[5731.12 → 5743.14] And as He laid down His life, we offer this sacrifice.
[5744.52 → 5755.90] That we will live just as He died, willing to pay the price.
[5755.90 → 5762.72] Willing to pay the price.
[5764.64 → 5778.94] How beautiful, the radiant bride, who waits for the room with His light in her eyes.
[5778.94 → 5791.94] How beautiful, when humble hearts give the fruit of pure lies, so that others might live.
[5791.94 → 5813.94] How beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful is the body of Christ.
[5813.94 → 5831.72] How beautiful, the feet that bring, the sound of good news and the love of the King.
[5831.72 → 5833.72] How beautiful, how beautiful.
[5833.72 → 5844.60] How beautiful, the hands that serve, the wine and the bread, and the sons of the earth.
[5844.60 → 5868.60] How beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful is the body of Christ.
[5868.60 → 5888.10] How beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful, How beautiful, kä teeth.
[5888.24 → 5898.58] How beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful, how bright, and the splendour, how beautiful, glowed, and the love of the Lord.
[5898.58 → 5910.68] I'm going to invite you to stand.
[5911.60 → 5913.86] We're going to close with a prayer,
[5914.60 → 5917.54] and then right after the prayer,
[5917.70 → 5922.86] we will receive the blessing of our God and sing together.
[5923.64 → 5927.22] Just a reminder that we are having coffee following the service,
[5927.22 → 5932.60] and to help facilitate that, since this was a last-minute invitation,
[5933.10 → 5937.44] we might need some people to jump into their volunteer roles and help with that,
[5937.52 → 5939.92] and then even equally important, perhaps even more so,
[5940.46 → 5943.54] after the service of coffee, to do the dishes
[5943.54 → 5945.56] and to make sure everything gets cleaned up and put away.
[5945.66 → 5947.60] So if that's something that you are able to do,

[5952.22 → 5959.80] Lord, our God, in deep gratitude for this moment,

[5965.02 → 5967.80] we give ourselves to you.
[5969.40 → 5973.04] Take us out to live as changed people,
[5973.04 → 5976.74] because we have shared the living bread together
[5976.74 → 5978.48] and cannot remain the same.

[5998.60 → 6001.02] both as inhabitants of earth
[6001.02 → 6004.66] and as citizens of the kingdom of heaven.

[6012.80 → 6014.76] and now we go.
[6016.04 → 6019.16] We go with your blessing.

[6021.86 → 6023.16] to guard you.
[6024.32 → 6025.78] May God go behind you
[6025.78 → 6026.64] to protect you.

[6029.14 → 6029.98] to support you.

[6036.70 → 6037.64] come upon you today.
