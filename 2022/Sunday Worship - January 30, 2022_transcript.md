[0.00 --> 22.40]  To you, Lord, Christ my Lord, I am not my own, but beyond body and soul.
[22.40 --> 37.26]  In my life and in death, to you, Lord, Christ my Lord.
[37.26 --> 50.26]  I am not my own, but beyond body and soul.
[50.26 --> 65.26]  In my life and in death, to you, Lord, Christ my Lord.
[65.26 --> 95.24]  I am not my own, but beyond body and soul.
[95.24 --> 100.70]  I raise a hallelujah.
[100.70 --> 107.00]  Louder than the unbelief.
[107.00 --> 112.46]  I raise a hallelujah.
[112.46 --> 117.92]  My weapon is a melody.
[117.92 --> 124.08]  I raise a hallelujah.
[124.08 --> 130.54]  Heaven comes to fight for me.
[130.54 --> 138.12]  I'm gonna sing in the middle of the storm.
[138.12 --> 141.26]  Louder and louder.
[141.26 --> 144.72]  You're gonna hear my praises roar.
[144.72 --> 149.72]  Up from the ashes, hope will arise.
[149.72 --> 153.18]  God is defeated.
[153.18 --> 155.18]  The king is alive.
[155.18 --> 159.18]  I raise a hallelujah.
[159.18 --> 167.64]  I raise a hallelujah.
[167.64 --> 170.94]  I raise a hallelujah.
[170.94 --> 174.40]  With everything inside me.
[174.40 --> 179.70]  I raise a hallelujah.
[179.70 --> 185.90]  I will watch the darkness flee.
[185.90 --> 191.40]  I raise a hallelujah.
[191.40 --> 196.86]  In the middle of the mystery.
[196.86 --> 201.16]  I raise a hallelujah.
[201.16 --> 203.16]  I raise a hallelujah.
[203.16 --> 205.16]  I raise a hallelujah.
[205.16 --> 212.16]  God is defeated.
[212.16 --> 213.10]  I raise a hallelujah.
[213.10 --> 215.62]  I raise a hallelujah.
[215.62 --> 217.16]  I raise a hallelujah.
[217.16 --> 221.54]  I raise a hallelujah.
[221.54 --> 225.38]  God is defeated.
[225.38 --> 234.38]  He's defeated.
[234.38 --> 236.48]  He scores 229 on the bellas gepositions of choice.
[236.48 --> 240.06]  In the negligence of spirit.
[240.06 --> 240.60]  The Andrew Trump chamber works the highest I got as a hallelujah.
[240.60 --> 242.92]  Paul Cushy teaches a hallelujah.
[242.92 --> 245.10] wig forgot to train with God's angel.
[245.10 --> 247.68]  His will have to train with God.
[247.68 --> 250.50]  She worshiped the hallelujah.
[250.50 --> 252.98]  Sing a little louder
[252.98 --> 256.18]  My weapon is a melody
[256.18 --> 259.22]  Sing a little louder
[259.22 --> 262.18]  Heaven comes to fight for me
[262.18 --> 264.74]  Sing a little louder
[264.74 --> 268.02]  In the presence of my enemies
[268.02 --> 270.82]  Sing a little louder
[270.82 --> 273.78]  Louder than the unbelief
[273.78 --> 276.42]  Sing a little louder
[276.42 --> 279.70]  My weapon is a melody
[279.70 --> 282.66]  Sing a little louder
[282.66 --> 285.54]  Heaven comes to fight for me
[285.54 --> 288.50]  Sing a little louder
[288.50 --> 291.14]  I'm gonna sing
[291.14 --> 294.42]  In the middle of the storm
[294.42 --> 296.82]  Louder and louder
[296.82 --> 300.26]  You're gonna hear my praises roar
[300.26 --> 303.22]  Up from the ashes
[303.22 --> 306.10]  Hope will arise
[306.10 --> 308.74]  Death is defeated
[308.74 --> 312.66]  The King is alive
[312.66 --> 314.58]  The King is alive
[314.58 --> 315.70]  The King is alive
[315.70 --> 345.68]  I love you.
[345.70 --> 375.68]  I love you.
[375.70 --> 377.70]  I love you.
[377.70 --> 379.70]  I love you.
[379.70 --> 381.70]  I love you.
[381.70 --> 383.70]  I love you.
[383.70 --> 385.70]  I love you.
[385.70 --> 387.70]  I love you.
[387.70 --> 389.70]  I love you.
[389.70 --> 391.70]  I love you.
[391.70 --> 393.70]  I love you.
[393.70 --> 395.70]  I love you.
[395.70 --> 397.70]  I love you.
[397.70 --> 399.70]  I love you.
[399.70 --> 401.70]  I love you.
[401.70 --> 403.70]  I love you.
[403.70 --> 407.70]  I love you.
[407.70 --> 409.70]  I love you.
[409.70 --> 411.70]  I love you.
[411.70 --> 415.18]  Blessed be your glory, I can name.
[419.08 --> 422.14]  Blessed be your name.
[422.46 --> 426.10]  When the sun is shining down on me.
[426.58 --> 430.36]  When the world's all as it should be.
[430.74 --> 432.30]  Blessed be your name.
[435.64 --> 438.70]  Blessed be your name.
[438.70 --> 442.44]  On the road marked with suffering.
[443.16 --> 446.50]  Though there's pain in the offering.
[447.50 --> 448.90]  Blessed be your name.
[449.28 --> 450.34]  Yes, Lord.
[451.94 --> 456.08]  Every blessing you pour out of.
[456.46 --> 458.86]  Turn back to praise.
[460.50 --> 464.28]  When the darkness closes in more.
[464.28 --> 466.28]  Still I will say.
[466.40 --> 470.80]  Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[471.04 --> 473.34]  Blessed be your name.
[475.00 --> 479.12]  Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[479.80 --> 483.04]  Blessed be your glorious name.
[483.86 --> 485.60]  Blessed be the name.
[486.68 --> 488.62]  Blessed be your name.
[488.62 --> 490.24]  Blessed be your name.
[490.24 --> 495.64]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[495.64 --> 502.12]  Blessed be your glorious name
[502.12 --> 506.22]  To give and take away
[506.22 --> 510.36]  To give and take away
[510.36 --> 514.56]  My heart will choose to say
[514.56 --> 518.84]  Blessed be your name
[518.84 --> 522.82]  To give and take away
[522.82 --> 526.94]  Oh, you give and take away
[526.94 --> 531.04]  My heart will choose to say
[531.04 --> 536.84]  For blessed be your name
[536.84 --> 541.22]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[541.22 --> 544.34]  Blessed be your name
[544.34 --> 549.60]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[549.60 --> 553.54]  Blessed be your glorious name
[553.54 --> 557.66]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[557.66 --> 560.32]  Blessed be your name
[560.32 --> 562.32]  A true...
[562.32 --> 565.38]  Good morning!
[565.80 --> 566.56]  How are we all doing?
[568.74 --> 570.42]  Alright, Haley's doing good.
[570.50 --> 571.62]  How about everybody over here?
[573.26 --> 574.96]  Oh, Allie's doing okay.
[575.18 --> 576.56]  The rest of you aren't yet sure.
[577.34 --> 578.04]  Alright, well.
[578.78 --> 580.98]  Welcome to worship.
[581.36 --> 584.34]  I am so excited that you are here
[584.34 --> 586.40]  and for those who are making their way in yet,
[586.70 --> 587.78]  welcome to you.
[587.78 --> 588.98]  If you're joining us online,
[589.12 --> 591.80]  we are glad that you are participating with us
[591.80 --> 593.72]  in our worship together this morning.
[593.84 --> 594.46]  My name is Chris.
[594.98 --> 596.32]  I'm one of the pastors here
[596.32 --> 599.10]  and with these other people that you see on stage
[599.10 --> 600.32]  and yet a few more,
[600.68 --> 604.74]  we will lead you in our shared worship together this morning.
[605.38 --> 606.04]  Before we begin,
[606.12 --> 608.04]  there's just a couple housekeeping notes
[608.04 --> 609.46]  that we want to make you aware of.
[609.46 --> 613.74]  the first of which is that next week
[613.74 --> 615.16]  in our worship together,
[615.16 --> 618.28]  we will be celebrating the Lord's Supper.
[618.94 --> 621.28]  And so we want to put that on your hearts
[621.28 --> 622.30]  for the week to come
[622.30 --> 624.16]  that you can prepare it yourself.
[624.42 --> 625.94]  And if you have kids,
[626.00 --> 626.96]  you can talk to your kids
[626.96 --> 628.80]  about what that experience is like
[628.80 --> 629.56]  and what that means
[629.56 --> 631.72]  so we can come together to the table.
[632.22 --> 633.76]  For those of you who are thinking
[633.76 --> 635.34]  and doing the math on that,
[635.40 --> 637.30]  it is technically a week early
[637.30 --> 639.82]  from our normal practice of things,
[639.82 --> 640.80]  but it is correct.
[641.98 --> 643.42]  And so next week, Sunday,
[643.42 --> 646.20]  we're going to be looking at the Passover event
[646.20 --> 647.68]  in our worship together.
[647.78 --> 649.80]  And so we wanted to tie those two things together.
[650.22 --> 652.06]  And then also in two weeks time,
[652.14 --> 652.88]  I am away.
[653.24 --> 654.60]  And so this is the easiest way
[654.60 --> 656.58]  to facilitate that service together.
[656.58 --> 658.98]  So prepare yourselves over this next week.
[660.28 --> 662.26]  Additionally, we want to just bring some clarity
[662.26 --> 663.12]  to an announcement
[663.12 --> 664.34]  that was in the midweek memo.
[664.66 --> 665.94]  For those of you who are interested
[665.94 --> 668.42]  in our Easter choir,
[669.34 --> 670.88]  the practices are beginning for that
[670.88 --> 672.04]  on February 9.
[672.68 --> 674.26]  And there was a correction,
[674.42 --> 675.26]  then another correction,
[675.52 --> 677.86]  and now this is finalized,
[678.24 --> 678.88]  Lord willing.
[679.32 --> 680.96]  February 9 will be the first practice.
[681.08 --> 682.42]  If you have any questions about that,
[682.46 --> 684.56]  you can talk to Mark DeGeis,
[684.56 --> 686.48]  who is here this morning.
[686.58 --> 687.96]  Mark, wave nice and big, everyone.
[688.08 --> 688.50]  That's Mark.
[688.58 --> 690.56]  You can grab him following the service
[690.56 --> 692.92]  or check in with us later for more details.
[694.66 --> 696.64]  I have a note that Brandon Muller
[696.64 --> 697.74]  is going to make an announcement.
[697.90 --> 698.36]  Is he here?
[699.70 --> 700.60]  There you are.
[701.20 --> 701.60]  All right.
[702.18 --> 703.20]  Brandon, come on up.
[703.82 --> 704.52]  Grab a microphone.
[716.58 --> 721.42]  Yeah, just a quick one for Youth Mexico.
[722.12 --> 723.82]  We got a meeting after the service today
[723.82 --> 724.50]  for five minutes.
[724.54 --> 725.84]  Just go over your guys' fundraiser
[725.84 --> 726.76]  that you'll be starting.
[727.40 --> 728.80]  And then next week, Sunday,
[728.90 --> 730.20]  the 6th, I think that is,
[730.74 --> 732.70]  we'll be doing a meeting after Youth Coffee.
[732.92 --> 734.28]  So it'll be 2 to 4 o'clock
[734.28 --> 734.94]  will be our meeting.
[735.06 --> 736.40]  Youth Coffee is 12 to 2 or so.
[737.46 --> 738.96]  So yeah, that's just the quick ones.
[738.96 --> 740.84]  I know we email that out as well,
[740.96 --> 742.38]  but just to make sure it's known.
[747.60 --> 748.22]  All right.
[748.46 --> 749.52]  Thank you, Brandon.
[749.58 --> 751.08]  If you have any questions for Brandon,
[751.16 --> 751.88]  you can grab him,
[752.38 --> 755.16]  and he will address those as well.
[755.66 --> 756.70]  And then the last one,
[756.86 --> 757.96]  that there is 2020 tonight,
[758.60 --> 760.12]  that's a youth program.
[760.20 --> 761.28]  If you have any questions about that,
[761.58 --> 762.34]  you can ask Pastor Kevin.
[762.58 --> 763.54]  He knows those things.
[763.54 --> 765.62]  As you're able,
[765.72 --> 766.20]  and where you are,
[766.36 --> 767.36]  I'm going to invite you to stand.
[767.82 --> 770.22]  We are gathered into the presence of God,
[770.32 --> 771.40]  and he welcomes us
[771.40 --> 774.70]  and greets us with his own words.
[775.22 --> 777.48]  Receive the greeting of our God.
[778.64 --> 782.10]  Grace, mercy, and peace to you.
[782.38 --> 783.40]  From God our Father,
[783.48 --> 784.48]  and the Lord Jesus Christ,
[784.56 --> 786.30]  his Son, and our Savior,
[786.74 --> 788.22]  through the presence and power
[788.22 --> 789.42]  of the Holy Spirit.
[790.66 --> 790.94]  Amen.
[793.54 --> 813.78]  You give light,
[813.88 --> 815.68]  you are love,
[815.68 --> 820.12]  you bring light to the darkness,
[820.48 --> 822.18]  you give hope,
[822.18 --> 829.18]  you restore every heart that is broken.
[832.56 --> 836.18]  Grace are you, Lord.
[838.08 --> 842.04]  It's your breath in our lives,
[842.04 --> 844.98]  so we pour out our praise,
[845.32 --> 847.12]  you pour out our praise.
[847.18 --> 850.82]  It's your breath in our lives,
[850.82 --> 854.04]  so we pour out our praise,
[854.16 --> 856.82]  you hold me.

[873.08 --> 878.08]  you give light, you give light, you restore every heart that is broken.
[878.08 --> 880.08]  Every heart that is broken.
[880.08 --> 882.08]  Every heart that is broken.
[882.08 --> 883.08]  Every heart that is broken.
[883.08 --> 885.08]  Every heart that is broken.
[885.08 --> 886.08]  Every heart that is broken.
[886.08 --> 887.08]  Great are you, Lord.
[887.08 --> 891.08]  It's your breath in our lives,
[891.08 --> 894.08]  your breath in our lives,
[894.08 --> 897.68]  so we pour out our grace,
[898.08 --> 899.76]  you pour out our praise.
[899.76 --> 903.60]  It's your breath in our lives,
[903.60 --> 906.66]  so we pour out our grace,
[906.86 --> 908.60]  you're holy.
[908.60 --> 922.24]  And all the earth will shout your praise
[922.24 --> 926.78]  Our hearts will cry, these hosts will sing
[926.78 --> 934.72]  May I be all you are
[934.72 --> 939.74]  And all the earth will shout your praise
[939.74 --> 944.12]  Our hearts will cry, these hosts will sing
[944.12 --> 950.86]  Great are you Lord
[950.86 --> 956.90]  And all the earth will shout your praise
[956.90 --> 961.28]  Our hearts will cry, these hosts will sing
[961.28 --> 968.08]  Great are you Lord

[973.32 --> 978.30]  So we pour out our praise, pour out our praise
[978.30 --> 981.88]  It's your breath in our lungs
[981.88 --> 986.10]  So we pour out our praise to you only
[986.10 --> 990.52]  It's your breath in our lungs
[990.52 --> 995.62]  So we pour out our praise, pour out our praise
[995.62 --> 999.20]  It's your breath in our lungs
[999.20 --> 1004.26]  So we pour out our praise to you only
[1004.26 --> 1019.86]  Revelation 15, 3-4 is our call to worship
[1019.86 --> 1023.06]  Great and amazing are your deeds
[1023.06 --> 1025.06]  O Lord God the Almighty
[1025.06 --> 1027.70]  Just and true are your ways
[1027.70 --> 1029.46]  O King of the nations
[1029.46 --> 1032.06]  Who will not fear, O Lord
[1032.06 --> 1033.66]  And glorify your name
[1033.66 --> 1036.06]  For you alone are holy
[1036.06 --> 1039.28]  All nations will come and worship you
[1039.28 --> 1042.44]  For your righteous acts have been revealed
[1042.44 --> 1072.42]  I love you
[1072.42 --> 1075.02]  For your mercy never fails me
[1075.02 --> 1079.02]  For your mercy never fails me
[1079.02 --> 1086.42]  All my days I've been held in your hands
[1086.42 --> 1089.72]  From the moment that I wake up
[1089.72 --> 1093.36]  Until I lay my head
[1093.36 --> 1095.96]  I will sing
[1095.96 --> 1098.96]  I will sing
[1098.96 --> 1099.96]  I will sing
[1099.96 --> 1106.46]  All my life you have been faithful
[1106.46 --> 1113.46]  All my life you have been so, so good
[1113.46 --> 1127.60]  Oh God, with every breath that I am able, I will sing upon the goodness of God.
[1127.60 --> 1139.04]  My heart, your voice, you have led me through the fire, in darkest night.
[1139.04 --> 1150.40]  You are close like no other, I've known you as a father, I've known you as a friend.
[1150.40 --> 1157.18]  I have lived in the goodness of God.
[1157.18 --> 1164.14]  All my life you have been faithful.
[1166.54 --> 1173.32]  All my life you have been so, so good.
[1173.32 --> 1185.68]  With every breath that I am able, I will sing upon the goodness of God.
[1187.68 --> 1193.32]  Your goodness is running after, it's running after me.
[1193.32 --> 1200.32]  Your goodness is running after, it's running after me.
[1201.04 --> 1204.60]  With my heart laid down, I surrender now.
[1204.88 --> 1206.96]  I give you everything.
[1209.06 --> 1214.30]  Your goodness is running after, it's running after me.
[1214.30 --> 1228.30]  Your goodness is running after, it's running after me.
[1228.30 --> 1232.12]  With my life laid down, I surrender now.
[1232.30 --> 1234.38]  I give you everything.

[1321.58 --> 1329.80]  Before even time began
[1329.80 --> 1335.20]  My life was in His hand
[1335.20 --> 1341.32]  He knows my name
[1341.32 --> 1349.04]  He knows my every God
[1349.04 --> 1354.60]  He leaves each year that falls
[1354.60 --> 1359.84]  And hears me when I call
[1359.84 --> 1365.80]  Oh, my Father
[1365.80 --> 1372.96]  He calls me His own
[1372.96 --> 1378.76]  He'll never leave me
[1378.76 --> 1384.32]  No matter where I go
[1384.32 --> 1390.76]  He knows my name
[1390.76 --> 1397.76]  He knows my every God
[1397.76 --> 1403.32]  He sees each year that falls
[1403.32 --> 1408.88]  And hears me when I call

[1410.88 --> 1415.32]  He knows my name
[1415.32 --> 1420.88]  He knows my every God
[1420.88 --> 1426.44]  He sees each year that falls
[1426.44 --> 1430.44]  He hears me when I call
[1430.44 --> 1433.44]  He hears me when I call
[1433.44 --> 1439.00]  He hears me when I call
[1439.00 --> 1444.56]  Let's pray

[1452.68 --> 1453.68]  Please forgive us
[1453.68 --> 1454.68]  Please forgive us

[1460.24 --> 1462.24]  Please forgive us

[1690.78 --> 1693.78]  Which is what today's special offering is for
[1693.78 --> 1697.78]  Cadet ministry is based on landmarks that guide all cadets
[1697.78 --> 1701.78]  Programs designed to meet boys where they are in life
[1701.78 --> 1704.78]  And publications that entertain and educate

[1751.32 --> 1756.16]  Everything to God in prayer
[1756.16 --> 1761.82]  Oh, what peace we often forfeit
[1761.82 --> 1766.68]  Oh, what needless pain we bear
[1766.68 --> 1771.52]  Oh, because we do not carry
[1771.52 --> 1777.06]  Everything to God in prayer
[1777.06 --> 1784.80]  Have we trials and temptations?
[1785.42 --> 1788.16]  Is there trouble anywhere?

[1880.04 --> 1882.16]  Everyone else want to come on up front?
[1882.16 --> 1892.16]  I was looking around the church
[1892.16 --> 1893.58]  I didn't think there were that many kids here
[1893.58 --> 1894.56]  Then all of a sudden they just start
[1894.56 --> 1895.78]  Coming out of the woodwork here
[1895.78 --> 1896.50]  That's pretty good
[1896.50 --> 1903.08]  Today?
[1908.60 --> 1910.06]  Okay, that sounds like fun
[1910.06 --> 1911.82]  How's everyone else doing today?
[1912.16 --> 1912.84]  Good?
[1914.18 --> 1916.58]  Okay, last week we were here
[1916.58 --> 1921.30]  And Mrs. Lovert did a really cool example of something
[1921.30 --> 1923.96]  Does anybody remember what happened last week?
[1924.52 --> 1925.46]  When we were sitting here?
[1926.96 --> 1928.70]  Ruby, do you remember what happened?
[1929.02 --> 1929.82]  Do you remember what happened?
[1931.00 --> 1932.04]  We were talking about faith
[1932.04 --> 1934.60]  And what was the example they used
[1934.60 --> 1936.42]  Or Mrs. Lovert used?
[1936.50 --> 1936.78]  Yes
[1936.78 --> 1936.84]  Yes
[1936.84 --> 1937.70]  Yes
[1937.70 --> 1943.02]  Do you guys all remember that?
[1943.18 --> 1944.54]  Ruby was standing down here
[1944.54 --> 1946.58]  And Mrs. Lovert was standing up on the stage
[1946.58 --> 1948.94]  And we were wondering if Ruby was going to be able to catch her
[1948.94 --> 1949.36]  What do you think?
[1949.40 --> 1950.14]  Was that going to happen?
[1950.14 --> 1952.74]  But then we reversed the roles
[1952.74 --> 1953.88]  Was that better?
[1954.64 --> 1955.92]  And we could trust that
[1955.92 --> 1959.18]  Mrs. Lovert was going to be able to catch Ruby, right?
[1963.94 --> 1965.26]  Okay, sounds good
[1965.26 --> 1967.76]  Today we are going to
[1967.76 --> 1970.42]  We're going to talk about a story about prayer
[1970.42 --> 1973.40]  And I was going to ask you guys a couple questions about prayer
[1973.40 --> 1977.40]  What are some things that we often pray for?
[1977.46 --> 1978.68]  Does anybody got any ideas?
[1979.40 --> 1981.66]  Our mom and dad and kittens
[1981.66 --> 1983.80]  The mom and dad and kittens
[1983.80 --> 1984.66]  That sounds good
[1984.66 --> 1985.06]  What else?
[1985.10 --> 1985.70]  Anybody else?
[1985.78 --> 1987.10]  What are some things you pray about
[1987.10 --> 1988.74]  At home or at school?
[1992.16 --> 1992.56]  Yeah
[1992.56 --> 1995.36]  To have a good day
[1995.36 --> 1996.14]  That's good
[1996.14 --> 1996.88]  Anything else?
[1997.10 --> 1997.86]  Anybody else got any?
[1997.86 --> 2007.42]  Thank you that the Lord died on the cross
[2007.42 --> 2008.66]  Very good, very good
[2008.66 --> 2010.02]  And how many people
[2010.02 --> 2010.62]  Let me think
[2010.62 --> 2012.54]  There's different places we often pray
[2012.54 --> 2013.82]  Does anybody got any ideas?
[2013.94 --> 2015.08]  Where do you pray?
[2015.20 --> 2015.82]  At church?
[2015.92 --> 2016.30]  We pray?
[2016.42 --> 2016.82]  Where else?
[2016.94 --> 2017.56]  Where do you pray?
[2023.36 --> 2024.80]  At school, at home, and church
[2024.80 --> 2025.38]  How about you?

[2028.66 --> 2029.46]  Well, that's good
[2029.46 --> 2030.08]  That's great
[2030.08 --> 2031.32]  We should be praying everywhere
[2031.32 --> 2031.52]  I wonder
[2031.52 --> 2036.96]  You sing to God?
[2037.04 --> 2038.30]  Well, he's going to be loving that
[2038.30 --> 2039.74]  He's loving that we're praying all the time
[2039.74 --> 2040.96]  And that we're singing to him often
[2040.96 --> 2041.68]  That's really good
[2041.68 --> 2043.90]  So today we're going to talk about prayer in the back
[2043.90 --> 2044.96]  And there's a really
[2044.96 --> 2048.04]  A prayer that's been very
[2048.04 --> 2050.28]  That's been used very often in the New Testament
[2050.28 --> 2052.82]  Has anybody ever heard of the Lord's Prayer?
[2053.72 --> 2054.06]  Yeah?
[2054.76 --> 2056.80]  So we're going to talk a bit about that
[2056.80 --> 2058.18]  In children's worship time
[2058.18 --> 2058.92]  In the back
[2058.92 --> 2060.92]  Can I pray with you guys right now?
[2062.08 --> 2062.86]  Let's do that

[2071.86 --> 2072.66]  We're going to pray together
[2072.66 --> 2073.72]  Heavenly Father

[2081.60 --> 2084.32]  And I ask that you bless the leaders

[2128.74 --> 2129.16]  There
[2129.16 --> 2143.64]  Good morning.
[2145.26 --> 2146.28]  My name is Dave.
[2146.40 --> 2147.86]  I am one of the elders on council,
[2148.14 --> 2151.40]  and it is my privilege to be able to lead us in our church family prayer.
[2152.12 --> 2152.84]  Let us pray.
[2155.58 --> 2157.86]  Father, this is the day that you have made.
[2157.86 --> 2160.34]  We rejoice, and we are glad in it.
[2160.96 --> 2164.42]  Father, we praise you because of your love and your providence that you have showed us,
[2164.78 --> 2169.02]  the love and the guidance you have given us throughout this week and throughout our lives.
[2170.08 --> 2176.06]  Father, it is important that we confess all of our sins and our shortcomings.
[2177.14 --> 2181.58]  We confess that there are deeds that we have done or deeds that we should have done.
[2181.94 --> 2185.76]  We pray that there have been words that we have said or words that we should have said.
[2185.76 --> 2190.16]  And quite often, we act out of selfishness or anger.
[2190.84 --> 2195.00]  Father, we thank you that we do not have to bear all those sins,
[2195.42 --> 2198.08]  that we do not have to carry that burden through our lives,
[2198.26 --> 2202.54]  but that Jesus willingly took that burden on himself and took them on the cross,
[2202.68 --> 2204.56]  and we don't have to bear them anymore.
[2204.82 --> 2206.88]  We thank you for that unspeakable gift.
[2206.88 --> 2214.44]  And in reply and in joy and in gratitude, we take seriously our command,
[2215.06 --> 2220.24]  your command, for us to act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with our God.
[2221.24 --> 2223.72]  Father, we thank you for your church.
[2224.00 --> 2227.26]  We thank you for this church congregation and the ministries that we have.
[2227.82 --> 2230.76]  We think about Children's Worship Time, where we're meeting right now.
[2231.02 --> 2232.80]  We think about the Gems and the Cadets.
[2232.80 --> 2234.86]  We think about youth in 2020.
[2235.36 --> 2238.38]  We think about our young adults, nursery, coffee break.
[2238.76 --> 2242.18]  We pray for those who are preparing for a Mexico missions trip.
[2242.62 --> 2245.08]  We thank you for all those missions and all of our others,
[2245.80 --> 2251.18]  ways to bring our congregation closer to you and to serve those in our community.
[2252.20 --> 2256.74]  Father, we think about our offering today for the Calvitas Connect Corps
[2256.74 --> 2260.46]  and how many churches are celebrating Cadet Sunday.
[2260.46 --> 2266.74]  We thank you for that ministry, and we take seriously their motto,
[2267.30 --> 2272.26]  that men can help boys to become more Christ-like in all areas of life.
[2273.18 --> 2277.86]  Father, we think about our church that will be celebrating the Lord's Supper next week.
[2278.02 --> 2280.82]  It is an important visible sign for all of us.
[2281.36 --> 2284.40]  We thank you that when we look at the bread and the cup,
[2284.72 --> 2286.44]  we can think about the body and the Lord,
[2286.44 --> 2288.36]  the body and blood of the Lord,
[2288.82 --> 2292.84]  and how they've been broken and how his blood has been shed for all of our sins.
[2294.24 --> 2298.50]  Father, we think about our congregation and the world around us,
[2298.54 --> 2300.08]  and we think of many things to pray for.
[2300.62 --> 2305.26]  We think about the fear and the unrest in the Ukraine and with nearby Russia.
[2305.26 --> 2312.76]  We think about everyone who's experiencing fear because of this potential conflict and open hostility.
[2313.26 --> 2317.06]  We pray for leaders and diplomats who are trying to find a peaceful way around this.
[2317.56 --> 2322.68]  We do pray that there will be a way for us to avoid conflict but still stand up for justice.
[2323.48 --> 2325.54]  Father, we think about needs in our own congregation.
[2325.54 --> 2330.38]  We think about Miriam Visser, who has had some seizure-like symptoms.
[2330.86 --> 2335.40]  We pray for her medical help, that they'll be able to figure out what it is, what is wrong,
[2335.64 --> 2338.24]  and what is the best way to take care of her.
[2339.10 --> 2344.44]  Father, we pray for all of those in our congregation who have lost loved ones recently.
[2345.12 --> 2351.48]  It is something that is painful and difficult, and it affects the way we live our lives.
[2351.48 --> 2355.56]  We pray that you will provide them your love and your strength,
[2356.10 --> 2361.62]  that they will feel the love and encouragement from members of this congregation too.
[2362.44 --> 2364.62]  Father, we pray for those who are involved in ministry.
[2364.88 --> 2368.04]  We think about Jared Alkema, who is in Costa Rica with Cape and Ray,
[2368.68 --> 2370.60]  part of a leadership development program.
[2370.86 --> 2374.56]  We pray that these four months will be a very good time for him,
[2375.06 --> 2378.88]  for the people he works with, and the ministry that he takes part in.
[2378.88 --> 2383.70]  We think about Marilyn Heinen's nephew, Kevin, and wife, Colleen,
[2384.24 --> 2386.96]  with a serious car accident that they have been in.
[2387.26 --> 2390.18]  We thank you for the recovery that they have been experiencing,
[2390.52 --> 2392.54]  the miraculous recovery that they have.
[2392.88 --> 2396.00]  We pray for continued healing and that they'll be able to be restored
[2396.00 --> 2399.24]  to their full health and full mobility before too long.
[2400.08 --> 2403.60]  We think about the Canadian branch of the Christian Reformed Church,
[2404.02 --> 2407.20]  of your church, because they're looking for a new executive director.
[2407.20 --> 2410.64]  We pray for Pastor Chris, who is chairing the search committee for that,
[2411.10 --> 2415.90]  and that as they make decisions about what the future of our church will be like,
[2416.24 --> 2418.32]  that they will feel your wisdom and your clarity.
[2419.36 --> 2425.78]  Father, we think about provincial and federal leaders who are involved in responding to COVID
[2425.78 --> 2427.32]  in the best way that they know how.
[2427.68 --> 2429.60]  We pray that you give them wisdom and clarity,
[2429.60 --> 2435.36]  so that they will be able to make decisions that are good for all.
[2435.36 --> 2439.40]  We know there is a difficult balance of keeping people safe
[2439.40 --> 2443.22]  and trying to live our lives as freely as we can.
[2443.72 --> 2446.02]  We know that there are different reactions to the pandemic.
[2447.12 --> 2455.72]  We pray that even though this pandemic can show how divided people can be,
[2456.12 --> 2461.40]  we pray that everyone will continue this conversation with civility and respect.
[2461.40 --> 2466.84]  We think about our council as we make decisions about how COVID impacts our ministries
[2466.84 --> 2468.40]  and how we can best serve your people.
[2468.82 --> 2472.50]  We pray for wisdom and insight for that group as they meet this week.
[2473.26 --> 2477.64]  Father, we pray for Pastor Chris, who is leading us in our message today.
[2478.16 --> 2480.12]  We continue our study about the Exodus.
[2480.78 --> 2484.08]  And in that story, we see your love and your care for your people, Israel.
[2484.08 --> 2489.64]  And in that example before us, that we could also see your love and care for your church,
[2490.06 --> 2493.02]  for your worldwide church, and for this church, Emmanuel.
[2493.72 --> 2498.52]  We thank you for that name, Emmanuel, and the reminder that God is with us.
[2499.10 --> 2503.40]  Father, we pray these things, not because we deserve it, but we ask it in Jesus' name.
[2504.26 --> 2504.50]  Amen.
[2504.50 --> 2504.60]  Amen.
[2514.08 --> 2515.08]  Amen.
[2529.72 --> 2537.90]  So, as Dave prayed, as you see on the screen, we are indeed continuing looking at Exodus.
[2538.02 --> 2540.36]  In just a moment, I'm going to read from Exodus 7.
[2540.36 --> 2544.06]  We're going to look at the story of the Ten Plagues.
[2544.12 --> 2548.92]  But before we get into that, I want to just start with a controversy right away.
[2550.60 --> 2555.26]  And that controversy may divide along age lines.
[2556.26 --> 2561.88]  And so, while that is a consequence, it's not particularly my intent.
[2562.88 --> 2563.82]  But here it is.
[2563.82 --> 2576.02]  The movie, The Prince of Egypt, voiced by Val Kilmer in 1998, is better than the movie, The Ten Commandments, with Charlton Heston.
[2577.20 --> 2578.48]  Which was from 1954.
[2578.76 --> 2579.12]  Yes.
[2579.78 --> 2584.58]  I'm glad you said yes and not amen, because if that was the first loud amen that I've gotten in a year preaching here,
[2584.64 --> 2586.74]  that would be a really bad sign.
[2586.74 --> 2591.70]  Let me take that controversy one step further.
[2593.52 --> 2607.16]  The movie from 2014 with Christian Bale, Exodus, Gods and Kings, is better than Moe and the Big Exit, the VeggieTale movie from 2007.
[2609.34 --> 2610.52]  No, okay.
[2611.12 --> 2613.56]  I was expecting a boo, actually, so that's good.
[2613.56 --> 2618.48]  Here's my point in raising this thing.
[2618.60 --> 2629.44]  Most of us are at least minimally familiar with the story of Exodus, with in particular the Ten Commandments, or the Ten Plagues, and the Exodus, and the Ten Commandments.
[2629.72 --> 2630.90]  That little snapshot.
[2631.68 --> 2635.08]  And that's what we are getting into here this morning.
[2635.08 --> 2647.16]  And so because we are minimally familiar, because culture and pop culture has influenced some of our experience around those things,
[2647.22 --> 2653.00]  it can be hard to weed through all of that, or wade through all of that,
[2653.30 --> 2660.86]  and see what is actually in the text, and in the story, and the purpose thereof.
[2660.86 --> 2667.38]  And so I want to name that at the beginning, and then challenge you, with the best of your ability,
[2667.84 --> 2675.74]  to dig through that, and come into this story looking for something new.
[2677.06 --> 2678.76]  And so with that in mind, I'm going to read.
[2679.88 --> 2683.48]  I'm going to start in chapter 7 at verse 8.
[2684.40 --> 2687.02]  I think it's going to be on the screen behind me there, too.
[2687.02 --> 2693.36]  And now while we're going to talk about the first nine plagues today,
[2693.38 --> 2696.68]  we're not going to read all nine plagues together.
[2696.94 --> 2698.06]  But we will read the first one.
[2699.54 --> 2702.02]  The Lord said to Moses and Aaron,
[2702.92 --> 2705.12]  When Pharaoh says to you, perform a miracle,
[2705.70 --> 2706.96]  then say to Aaron,
[2707.40 --> 2710.36]  Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh,
[2710.64 --> 2711.92]  and it will become a snake.
[2711.92 --> 2717.72]  So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did just as the Lord had commanded.
[2719.06 --> 2722.64]  Aaron threw his staff down in front of Pharaoh and his officials,
[2722.84 --> 2724.58]  and it became a snake.
[2725.70 --> 2728.70]  Pharaoh then summoned wise men and sorcerers,
[2728.84 --> 2733.58]  and the Egyptian magicians also did the same things by their secret arts.
[2734.20 --> 2737.72]  Each one threw down his staff, and it became a snake.
[2737.72 --> 2742.72]  But Aaron's staff swallowed up their staffs.
[2743.94 --> 2745.98]  Yet Pharaoh's heart became hard,
[2746.10 --> 2749.00]  and he would not listen to them, just as the Lord had said.
[2750.60 --> 2752.38]  Then the Lord said to Moses,
[2752.98 --> 2755.02]  Pharaoh's heart is unyielding.
[2755.44 --> 2757.28]  He refuses to let the people go.
[2758.36 --> 2762.04]  Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he goes out to the river.
[2762.04 --> 2765.40]  Confront him on the bank of the Nile,
[2765.84 --> 2770.66]  and take in your hand the staff that was changed into a snake.
[2771.68 --> 2772.68]  Then say to him,
[2773.40 --> 2776.88]  The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you to say,
[2777.36 --> 2781.24]  Let my people go, so that they may worship me in the wilderness.
[2782.74 --> 2784.68]  But until now you have not listened.
[2785.60 --> 2787.16]  This is what the Lord says,
[2787.16 --> 2791.32]  By this you will know that I am the Lord.
[2792.28 --> 2794.62]  And with the staff that is in my hand,
[2794.70 --> 2796.60]  I will strike the water of the Nile,
[2796.70 --> 2798.68]  and it will be changed into blood.
[2799.66 --> 2801.54]  The fish of the Nile will die,
[2801.64 --> 2802.54]  the river will sink,
[2802.64 --> 2805.10]  the Egyptians will not be able to drink its water.
[2806.76 --> 2808.16]  The Lord said to Moses,
[2809.00 --> 2809.52]  Tell Aaron,
[2809.78 --> 2812.98]  Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt,
[2813.32 --> 2814.78]  over the streams and canals,
[2814.78 --> 2817.04]  over the ponds and over all the reservoirs,
[2817.16 --> 2818.80]  and they will turn to blood.
[2819.72 --> 2822.16]  Blood will be everywhere in Egypt,
[2822.54 --> 2825.08]  even in vessels of wood and stone.
[2826.62 --> 2828.10]  Moses and Aaron did,
[2828.24 --> 2829.66]  just as the Lord had commanded.
[2829.80 --> 2832.68]  He raised his staff in the presence of Pharaoh and his officials,
[2832.96 --> 2834.94]  and struck the water of the Nile,
[2835.12 --> 2837.64]  and all the water was changed into blood.
[2838.32 --> 2840.10]  The fish in the Nile died,
[2840.16 --> 2841.58]  and the river smelled so bad
[2841.58 --> 2843.58]  that the Egyptians could not drink its water.
[2843.58 --> 2846.64]  Blood was everywhere in Egypt.
[2847.16 --> 2852.14]  But the Egyptian magicians did the same things,
[2852.14 --> 2853.44]  by their secret arts,
[2853.68 --> 2855.52]  and Pharaoh's heart became hard.
[2856.30 --> 2858.20]  He would not listen to Moses and Aaron,
[2858.32 --> 2859.64]  just as the Lord had said.
[2860.02 --> 2862.72]  Instead, he turned and went into his palace,
[2862.72 --> 2865.20]  and did not even take this to heart.
[2865.86 --> 2868.94]  And all the Egyptians dug along the Nile
[2868.94 --> 2869.96]  to get drinking water,
[2870.12 --> 2873.92]  because they could not drink the water of the river.
[2873.92 --> 2875.98]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2879.70 --> 2882.54]  Now, the story of the ten plagues,
[2882.66 --> 2885.32]  familiar that it may be to us all,
[2885.64 --> 2887.70]  starts, as we read,
[2887.92 --> 2890.06]  with the story about the staff
[2890.06 --> 2891.66]  being turned into a snake.
[2892.80 --> 2894.40]  And this is a sort of introduction
[2894.40 --> 2896.46]  to the bigger unit
[2896.46 --> 2898.70]  that makes up the ten plagues.
[2898.70 --> 2901.02]  This morning, like I said,
[2901.08 --> 2903.66]  we're going to look at that bigger unit together.
[2905.28 --> 2906.58]  Next week, though,
[2906.68 --> 2910.14]  we will focus in particular on the last plague,
[2910.40 --> 2911.72]  the death of the firstborn,
[2911.82 --> 2912.74]  and then the Passover
[2912.74 --> 2914.20]  that comes with that.
[2915.38 --> 2916.50]  Now, I want to be clear
[2916.50 --> 2919.16]  that this isn't an arbitrary division
[2919.16 --> 2921.78]  that just works in our preaching schedule, right?
[2921.78 --> 2923.50]  The actual narrative structure
[2923.50 --> 2925.34]  of this whole section
[2925.34 --> 2927.42]  breaks the plagues down
[2927.42 --> 2929.80]  into three groups of three plagues,
[2929.88 --> 2930.94]  with the tenth plague
[2930.94 --> 2932.68]  coming at the end as the climax.
[2934.04 --> 2935.68]  There are phrases throughout,
[2935.76 --> 2937.20]  and you can look into this later,
[2937.32 --> 2938.86]  that indicate a time of day,
[2938.94 --> 2940.48]  or when Moses is called
[2940.48 --> 2942.16]  to go to Pharaoh and show,
[2942.52 --> 2944.16]  that reveals that this breakdown
[2944.16 --> 2946.70]  of three times three plus one
[2946.70 --> 2948.50]  is an intentional structure,
[2948.50 --> 2950.66]  and that the author is using it
[2950.66 --> 2952.44]  to make a particular point
[2952.44 --> 2954.06]  about the tenth plague
[2954.06 --> 2955.00]  and the Passover.
[2955.66 --> 2956.78]  We're just sort of using
[2956.78 --> 2957.88]  that same structure here.
[2959.04 --> 2960.78]  And to set the stage for that,
[2961.66 --> 2963.82]  really, from the get-go,
[2964.42 --> 2965.32]  right, to help us see
[2965.32 --> 2966.30]  what's going on here,
[2967.00 --> 2968.34]  we start with that story
[2968.34 --> 2970.44]  of a staff being turned into a snake,
[2971.00 --> 2973.32]  even though the Egyptian sorcerers
[2973.32 --> 2974.62]  can do the same thing.
[2974.62 --> 2976.90]  And then, amazingly,
[2977.58 --> 2979.48]  Aaron's staff, that snake,
[2979.96 --> 2981.04]  eats theirs.
[2982.28 --> 2983.80]  I want to dig into this a little
[2983.80 --> 2986.18]  and say that there are two levels
[2986.18 --> 2988.82]  to the symbolism that's happening here
[2988.82 --> 2990.66]  that sort of pervades
[2990.66 --> 2992.12]  the rest of the story.
[2993.44 --> 2994.02]  And so first,
[2994.88 --> 2997.20]  in Egyptian iconography,
[2997.84 --> 2999.70]  in Egyptian religious symbols,
[3000.00 --> 3001.76]  the snake is associated
[3001.76 --> 3003.12]  with the pharaoh.
[3003.12 --> 3005.08]  And you can see that
[3005.08 --> 3008.12]  in commonly depicted headdresses.
[3008.66 --> 3010.00]  I think we have an image there.
[3011.54 --> 3013.16]  And this is a burial mask
[3013.16 --> 3015.28]  that was found in the grave
[3015.28 --> 3017.52]  of Pharaoh Tutankhamen.
[3018.46 --> 3020.70]  This particular one is really famous.
[3021.64 --> 3024.26]  He reigned in the 14th century BC.
[3025.20 --> 3027.14]  I saw this mask actually on exhibit
[3027.14 --> 3029.78]  in the Cairo Museum in Egypt.
[3029.78 --> 3031.28]  But notice,
[3031.56 --> 3032.92]  in the center of the head,
[3033.02 --> 3035.98]  there is a bird of prey coming out.
[3036.06 --> 3037.56]  That's for the god Ra.
[3037.66 --> 3038.36]  We'll come back to him.
[3038.44 --> 3039.50]  And there is a snake
[3039.50 --> 3042.38]  emerging from the center of the head,
[3042.46 --> 3042.90]  a cobra.
[3043.90 --> 3044.70]  In Egypt,
[3045.58 --> 3047.46]  the pharaohs are also believed
[3047.46 --> 3048.54]  to be divine,
[3048.66 --> 3051.24]  or to become divine after death.
[3051.82 --> 3052.40]  And so,
[3052.54 --> 3053.30]  on one level,
[3053.40 --> 3054.26]  right at the beginning,
[3054.56 --> 3054.76]  right,
[3054.76 --> 3055.86]  the plague story
[3055.86 --> 3057.36]  begins with the god
[3057.36 --> 3058.56]  of the Israelites
[3058.56 --> 3059.78]  eating up
[3059.78 --> 3062.02]  a god to the Egyptians
[3062.02 --> 3063.76]  in the symbol of the pharaoh.
[3065.74 --> 3067.98]  The author wants us to see
[3067.98 --> 3071.26]  that this is god against gods,
[3071.60 --> 3072.72]  right from the beginning.
[3074.06 --> 3075.50]  There's also a second point
[3075.50 --> 3076.88]  to the symbol here.
[3076.88 --> 3079.32]  And that comes from the word
[3079.32 --> 3081.60]  that the Hebrew text uses for snake.
[3082.42 --> 3084.94]  The word used for snake
[3084.94 --> 3087.16]  is not the normal word
[3087.16 --> 3088.24]  that the Bible uses.
[3088.42 --> 3089.16]  And so, for instance,
[3089.34 --> 3090.10]  if you're familiar
[3090.10 --> 3091.98]  in the story of the fall,
[3092.08 --> 3093.26]  the rebellion in creation
[3093.26 --> 3094.22]  in Genesis 3,
[3094.34 --> 3094.92]  a serpent,
[3095.14 --> 3095.62]  a snake,
[3095.78 --> 3097.34]  comes and tempts Eve
[3097.34 --> 3098.24]  who then tempts Adam.
[3098.50 --> 3099.70]  That's not the same word
[3099.70 --> 3100.88]  that's used here
[3100.88 --> 3102.36]  in Exodus 7.
[3102.42 --> 3102.88]  Or even,
[3103.22 --> 3104.24]  in Numbers 21,
[3104.24 --> 3105.18]  you have the story
[3105.18 --> 3106.08]  of a whole bunch
[3106.08 --> 3106.88]  of venomous snakes
[3106.88 --> 3108.32]  descending on the people
[3108.32 --> 3108.96]  as they wandered
[3108.96 --> 3109.46]  in the wilderness
[3109.46 --> 3110.70]  and then Moses lifts up
[3110.70 --> 3111.60]  a bronze snake
[3111.60 --> 3112.62]  and if they look to that,
[3112.72 --> 3113.22]  they're saved.
[3114.10 --> 3115.68]  That's also a different word
[3115.68 --> 3116.40]  for snake.
[3116.80 --> 3117.14]  Instead,
[3118.10 --> 3119.40]  the word that's used here
[3119.40 --> 3120.26]  in this text
[3120.26 --> 3120.88]  is a word
[3120.88 --> 3122.16]  that is really translated
[3122.16 --> 3122.74]  in a whole bunch
[3122.74 --> 3123.58]  of different ways
[3123.58 --> 3126.32]  ranging from sea monster
[3126.32 --> 3127.46]  to jackal
[3127.46 --> 3128.54]  to wild beasts
[3128.54 --> 3129.24]  and yes,
[3129.40 --> 3131.04]  to serpents.
[3132.62 --> 3133.00]  And so,
[3133.00 --> 3134.04]  that's not to say
[3134.04 --> 3134.98]  that the word snake
[3134.98 --> 3135.76]  isn't included
[3135.76 --> 3136.64]  in the range of meaning
[3136.64 --> 3138.12]  but it is to say
[3138.12 --> 3139.28]  that when you look
[3139.28 --> 3139.86]  at this word
[3139.86 --> 3140.78]  in the Psalms
[3140.78 --> 3141.90]  or in the prophets,
[3142.54 --> 3143.86]  it's used to describe
[3143.86 --> 3145.08]  the kinds of places
[3145.08 --> 3146.28]  in the world
[3146.28 --> 3146.92]  that are sort of
[3146.92 --> 3148.10]  without God,
[3148.22 --> 3150.04]  the desolate places,
[3150.62 --> 3150.72]  right,
[3150.78 --> 3152.48]  the godless places.
[3154.12 --> 3156.82]  In Leviticus 16,
[3157.10 --> 3158.50]  in the day of atonement ceremony,
[3158.50 --> 3160.22]  you have the Israelites
[3160.22 --> 3162.20]  having to sacrifice a lamb
[3162.20 --> 3163.08]  and then they put the blood
[3163.08 --> 3163.84]  on another goat
[3163.84 --> 3164.90]  and they send that out
[3164.90 --> 3166.02]  into the wilderness,
[3166.92 --> 3167.06]  right,
[3167.10 --> 3169.32]  the places without God,
[3170.10 --> 3170.32]  right,
[3170.38 --> 3173.80]  the chaoses of the universe
[3173.80 --> 3176.56]  contrary to the places
[3176.56 --> 3178.52]  of God's established order.
[3179.52 --> 3181.08]  It's a word used
[3181.08 --> 3181.96]  in the Old Testament
[3181.96 --> 3183.28]  and in other ancient
[3183.28 --> 3184.20]  Near Eastern cultures
[3184.20 --> 3185.44]  to refer to
[3185.44 --> 3187.74]  the chaotic forces of nature,
[3187.74 --> 3190.72]  forces that Genesis tells us
[3190.72 --> 3191.70]  the Lord,
[3191.92 --> 3192.44]  Yahweh,
[3192.74 --> 3194.90]  overcame in creation.
[3196.78 --> 3197.56]  And so Pharaoh
[3197.56 --> 3199.88]  with his magicians
[3199.88 --> 3200.88]  and sorcerers
[3200.88 --> 3202.76]  is a stand-in
[3202.76 --> 3203.68]  right at the beginning
[3203.68 --> 3204.88]  and then all the way
[3204.88 --> 3205.32]  throughout
[3205.32 --> 3206.78]  for all things
[3206.78 --> 3208.02]  that are anti-God,
[3208.26 --> 3209.22]  anti-creation,
[3209.46 --> 3210.44]  anti-life,
[3210.84 --> 3212.62]  which is the true,
[3212.76 --> 3214.10]  which is what the true God
[3214.10 --> 3215.32]  is all about,
[3215.56 --> 3215.82]  right,
[3215.86 --> 3217.38]  and who the true God
[3217.38 --> 3219.08]  is about to reveal himself
[3219.08 --> 3221.38]  in absolute power
[3221.38 --> 3223.04]  through and over.
[3224.18 --> 3224.60]  And so,
[3224.78 --> 3225.16]  in summary,
[3225.28 --> 3226.60]  this is a battle
[3226.60 --> 3228.34]  between the true God
[3228.34 --> 3229.66]  and false gods
[3229.66 --> 3230.60]  and it is a battle
[3230.60 --> 3232.40]  for and through
[3232.40 --> 3233.94]  all of creation.
[3233.94 --> 3237.74]  I'm going to run through
[3237.74 --> 3238.54]  this pretty quickly
[3238.54 --> 3240.62]  and so I want to encourage you
[3240.62 --> 3241.74]  over the next week
[3241.74 --> 3243.50]  to take this on
[3243.50 --> 3244.74]  in your personal devotions,
[3245.00 --> 3245.18]  right,
[3245.22 --> 3246.38]  to get into the details
[3246.38 --> 3247.28]  of each story.
[3247.46 --> 3248.28]  We're going to sort of
[3248.28 --> 3249.90]  take a 10,000 foot view
[3249.90 --> 3250.96]  so you can see
[3250.96 --> 3252.62]  what I think is the big point
[3252.62 --> 3253.50]  of the story
[3253.50 --> 3254.64]  and then you can take it home
[3254.64 --> 3256.24]  and dig into the depths
[3256.24 --> 3257.82]  throughout this week.
[3259.40 --> 3262.58]  But if the opening story
[3262.58 --> 3264.88]  is between Moses and Aaron
[3264.88 --> 3266.64]  and the snakes being eaten,
[3266.82 --> 3267.98]  the opening move
[3267.98 --> 3269.14]  of this battle
[3269.14 --> 3271.94]  is between God and God
[3271.94 --> 3272.96]  takes place
[3272.96 --> 3274.98]  along the Nile River.
[3276.18 --> 3277.02]  Now, the Nile River
[3277.02 --> 3279.50]  is the source of life
[3279.50 --> 3280.74]  for the Egyptians
[3280.74 --> 3284.18]  and it's also the source of death
[3284.18 --> 3285.80]  for many Israelite boys
[3285.80 --> 3286.88]  a generation earlier.
[3287.88 --> 3289.20]  And this Nile River,
[3289.38 --> 3290.82]  which was the source of life,
[3290.82 --> 3292.52]  becomes death
[3292.52 --> 3293.92]  for the Egyptians.
[3295.78 --> 3297.74]  Now, for just a moment,
[3297.86 --> 3299.22]  get past the gruesomeness
[3299.22 --> 3300.84]  of everything being blood
[3300.84 --> 3303.78]  and here's what you can see.
[3305.08 --> 3306.46]  The Nile River
[3306.46 --> 3308.64]  is also worshipped
[3308.64 --> 3309.34]  in Egypt
[3309.34 --> 3310.74]  as a god.
[3311.50 --> 3312.80]  A god called Happy.
[3315.06 --> 3316.76]  This god Happy
[3316.76 --> 3319.56]  is representative
[3319.56 --> 3321.62]  of life
[3321.62 --> 3322.62]  and the changing
[3322.62 --> 3323.92]  of seasons
[3323.92 --> 3325.20]  and the provision
[3325.20 --> 3325.98]  of life
[3325.98 --> 3326.96]  that flows
[3326.96 --> 3327.94]  along the Nile.
[3328.06 --> 3328.34]  And so,
[3328.46 --> 3329.12]  an attack
[3329.12 --> 3330.50]  on the Nile
[3330.50 --> 3332.18]  is an attack
[3332.18 --> 3333.72]  on the entire structure
[3333.72 --> 3335.30]  of Egyptian life.
[3335.86 --> 3336.60]  Social life,
[3337.04 --> 3338.42]  agrarian farming life,
[3338.48 --> 3339.62]  and religious life.
[3340.24 --> 3340.36]  Right?
[3340.46 --> 3341.82]  All of Egyptian life
[3341.82 --> 3342.82]  is sustained
[3342.82 --> 3343.96]  and ruled
[3343.96 --> 3344.90]  by the Nile,
[3345.02 --> 3345.82]  by Happy.
[3345.82 --> 3347.82]  It's the annual calendar
[3347.82 --> 3349.20]  and the bringer
[3349.20 --> 3349.74]  of life.
[3350.76 --> 3352.06]  And at God's command,
[3352.56 --> 3353.44]  the very order
[3353.44 --> 3354.50]  of creation
[3354.50 --> 3355.96]  is being reversed.
[3356.84 --> 3356.98]  Right?
[3357.04 --> 3358.46]  Returning to chaos
[3358.46 --> 3359.22]  again
[3359.22 --> 3360.50]  at the command
[3360.50 --> 3361.50]  of God.
[3363.54 --> 3364.22]  Remember what we said.
[3364.28 --> 3364.84]  This is a battle
[3364.84 --> 3366.22]  for and through
[3366.22 --> 3367.48]  all of creation
[3367.48 --> 3369.02]  between the one true God
[3369.02 --> 3370.48]  and the false gods
[3370.48 --> 3371.68]  of Egypt.
[3371.68 --> 3373.56]  Now,
[3373.60 --> 3374.56]  the second plague,
[3374.72 --> 3375.82]  the plague of the frogs,
[3375.94 --> 3377.28]  is a continued attack
[3377.28 --> 3378.02]  by God
[3378.02 --> 3379.20]  on the religious systems
[3379.20 --> 3380.24]  of the Egyptians.
[3381.32 --> 3381.60]  Heket
[3381.60 --> 3383.26]  is the god
[3383.26 --> 3384.84]  of childbirth
[3384.84 --> 3386.32]  and fertility
[3386.32 --> 3387.10]  depicted
[3387.10 --> 3389.04]  in Egyptian art.
[3389.18 --> 3389.40]  Sorry,
[3389.48 --> 3389.70]  the goddess
[3389.70 --> 3390.94]  of childbirth
[3390.94 --> 3392.38]  depicted in Egyptian art
[3392.38 --> 3392.86]  with the head
[3392.86 --> 3393.46]  of a frog.
[3393.46 --> 3393.50]  frog.
[3394.68 --> 3395.16]  And so,
[3395.42 --> 3396.92]  the plague
[3396.92 --> 3397.92]  of frogs
[3397.92 --> 3399.62]  can be understood
[3399.62 --> 3401.02]  to be an attack
[3401.02 --> 3402.30]  on Egyptian
[3402.30 --> 3403.46]  fertility goddesses.
[3404.54 --> 3405.58]  Perhaps as a direct
[3405.58 --> 3406.74]  result of the Egyptians
[3406.74 --> 3407.88]  trying to squash
[3407.88 --> 3408.46]  the fertility
[3408.46 --> 3409.74]  of the Israelites
[3409.74 --> 3411.02]  generation before.
[3411.58 --> 3412.12]  But again,
[3412.18 --> 3413.80]  the point is being made.
[3413.94 --> 3414.02]  Right?
[3414.12 --> 3414.68]  Yahweh,
[3414.84 --> 3415.36]  the Lord,
[3415.46 --> 3416.18]  is bigger
[3416.18 --> 3416.92]  than the gods
[3416.92 --> 3417.34]  of Egypt
[3417.34 --> 3418.50]  and will unleash
[3418.50 --> 3419.34]  the forces
[3419.34 --> 3420.38]  of his creation
[3420.38 --> 3421.40]  to prove it.
[3422.60 --> 3423.58]  This continues
[3423.58 --> 3424.66]  in pattern.
[3424.80 --> 3424.90]  Now,
[3424.96 --> 3425.88]  the third plague,
[3426.70 --> 3427.92]  as far as we know,
[3428.16 --> 3428.96]  cannot be linked
[3428.96 --> 3430.98]  to a particular god
[3430.98 --> 3432.94]  in the Egyptian pantheon.
[3433.12 --> 3434.20]  It is still important
[3434.20 --> 3434.88]  to notice
[3434.88 --> 3436.06]  where it comes from.
[3436.92 --> 3437.02]  Right?
[3437.10 --> 3437.70]  Plagues two
[3437.70 --> 3438.36]  and three
[3438.36 --> 3438.98]  and four
[3438.98 --> 3440.70]  come from the water,
[3441.02 --> 3441.54]  the dust,
[3441.74 --> 3442.30]  and the air.
[3442.46 --> 3443.42]  Frogs from the water,
[3443.80 --> 3444.68]  gnats from the dust,
[3444.76 --> 3446.26]  and flies from the air.
[3447.16 --> 3447.40]  Right?
[3447.48 --> 3449.28]  And many biblical scholars
[3449.28 --> 3450.02]  notice that
[3450.02 --> 3451.56]  these correspond
[3451.56 --> 3452.72]  to the three
[3452.72 --> 3453.96]  sort of sectors
[3453.96 --> 3454.92]  or sections
[3454.92 --> 3456.12]  of the ecosystem.
[3456.38 --> 3456.52]  Right?
[3456.64 --> 3457.24]  Water,
[3457.66 --> 3457.98]  land,
[3458.10 --> 3458.84]  and air.
[3459.62 --> 3460.64]  And so the whole
[3460.64 --> 3462.16]  land of the living
[3462.16 --> 3463.08]  is controlled
[3463.08 --> 3464.30]  by the Lord.
[3465.56 --> 3465.70]  Now,
[3465.72 --> 3466.44]  it's also interesting
[3466.44 --> 3467.74]  for our comparison
[3467.74 --> 3468.46]  to note that
[3468.46 --> 3470.08]  the origin of this plague
[3470.08 --> 3471.02]  is the dust.
[3471.54 --> 3471.78]  Right?
[3471.84 --> 3472.78]  When in Genesis 3
[3472.78 --> 3474.02]  you read
[3474.02 --> 3475.62]  from dust you are
[3475.62 --> 3476.44]  and to dust
[3476.44 --> 3477.84]  you will return.
[3478.10 --> 3478.40]  Dust
[3478.40 --> 3479.80]  is for everyone
[3479.80 --> 3481.24]  a sign of human
[3481.24 --> 3481.94]  mortality
[3481.94 --> 3483.14]  and death.
[3483.34 --> 3483.64]  And so
[3483.64 --> 3485.36]  here in contrast
[3485.36 --> 3486.52]  to the fertility
[3486.52 --> 3487.64]  of the Nile
[3487.64 --> 3489.80]  and the overwhelming
[3489.80 --> 3492.22]  lucrative life
[3492.22 --> 3493.34]  of Egypt
[3493.34 --> 3494.14]  you get
[3494.14 --> 3494.88]  a symbol
[3494.88 --> 3495.50]  and sign
[3495.50 --> 3496.76]  of death.
[3497.18 --> 3497.44]  Pharaoh
[3497.44 --> 3498.30]  and the Egyptians
[3498.30 --> 3499.30]  are being moved
[3499.30 --> 3500.00]  towards
[3500.00 --> 3501.06]  a recognition
[3501.06 --> 3502.20]  of the one
[3502.20 --> 3503.02]  true God
[3503.02 --> 3504.82]  as the only God.
[3504.82 --> 3507.34]  the fourth plague
[3507.34 --> 3507.84]  comes
[3507.84 --> 3508.76]  that's the flies
[3508.76 --> 3509.62]  and it comes
[3509.62 --> 3510.38]  from the air
[3510.38 --> 3511.00]  and is used
[3511.00 --> 3511.54]  by God
[3511.54 --> 3512.02]  to show
[3512.02 --> 3512.72]  the comprehensive
[3512.72 --> 3513.10]  nature
[3513.10 --> 3513.78]  of his power
[3513.78 --> 3514.36]  over all
[3514.36 --> 3514.96]  of creation.
[3514.96 --> 3516.16]  The fourth plague
[3516.16 --> 3516.80]  is also
[3516.80 --> 3517.92]  the first plague
[3517.92 --> 3519.02]  that explicitly
[3519.02 --> 3520.60]  makes a distinction
[3520.60 --> 3521.86]  between Israel
[3521.86 --> 3522.72]  and the people
[3522.72 --> 3523.20]  of Egypt
[3523.20 --> 3524.38]  where things
[3524.38 --> 3524.86]  are utterly
[3524.86 --> 3525.52]  destroyed
[3525.52 --> 3526.54]  in Egypt
[3526.54 --> 3527.42]  except in the
[3527.42 --> 3528.44]  region of Goshen
[3528.44 --> 3529.74]  where the Israelites
[3529.74 --> 3530.14]  lived.
[3530.72 --> 3531.52]  This happens
[3531.52 --> 3532.74]  at least four times
[3532.74 --> 3533.76]  in the story
[3533.76 --> 3535.06]  and you can
[3535.06 --> 3536.40]  maybe read
[3536.40 --> 3537.08]  between the lines
[3537.08 --> 3537.86]  in a couple others
[3537.86 --> 3539.00]  to see a distinction.
[3540.44 --> 3541.66]  In the fifth plague
[3541.66 --> 3542.38]  we come back
[3542.38 --> 3542.96]  to an attack
[3542.96 --> 3543.72]  on the Egyptian
[3543.72 --> 3545.20]  pantheon of gods
[3545.20 --> 3545.92]  and so here
[3545.92 --> 3546.52]  we get the picture
[3546.52 --> 3547.62]  of Hathor
[3547.62 --> 3548.56]  who's the mother
[3548.56 --> 3549.60]  and sky goddess
[3549.60 --> 3550.64]  and is regularly
[3550.64 --> 3551.80]  depicted as a cow.
[3553.32 --> 3554.28]  The plague
[3554.28 --> 3555.18]  of livestock
[3555.18 --> 3556.38]  is another
[3556.38 --> 3557.26]  strike
[3557.26 --> 3558.62]  against Egypt's
[3558.62 --> 3559.92]  apparent strength.
[3560.74 --> 3560.92]  Right?
[3560.92 --> 3561.58]  And here too
[3561.58 --> 3562.42]  the reversal
[3562.42 --> 3563.80]  of creation
[3563.80 --> 3564.36]  order
[3564.36 --> 3565.30]  for the revealing
[3565.30 --> 3566.90]  of God's power
[3566.90 --> 3567.56]  is evident.
[3567.74 --> 3567.82]  Right?
[3567.92 --> 3568.84]  Animals that once
[3568.84 --> 3570.00]  provide life
[3570.00 --> 3570.64]  for people
[3570.64 --> 3572.00]  are taken from them
[3572.00 --> 3573.10]  and the symbol
[3573.10 --> 3574.30]  of new life
[3574.30 --> 3575.22]  is bringing
[3575.22 --> 3576.64]  only death.
[3578.38 --> 3579.16]  The plague
[3579.16 --> 3579.68]  of boils
[3579.68 --> 3580.56]  the sixth plague
[3580.56 --> 3581.84]  continues again
[3581.84 --> 3582.76]  as another attack
[3582.76 --> 3583.82]  on the religious system
[3583.82 --> 3585.82]  making God supreme
[3585.82 --> 3586.60]  because boils
[3586.60 --> 3587.36]  would make you
[3587.36 --> 3589.12]  ceremoniously unclean
[3589.12 --> 3589.84]  therefore unable
[3589.84 --> 3591.02]  to attend worship
[3591.02 --> 3591.72]  in temples
[3591.72 --> 3593.74]  and even in this one
[3593.74 --> 3594.12]  we're told
[3594.12 --> 3594.98]  the magicians
[3594.98 --> 3595.86]  couldn't stand
[3595.86 --> 3596.74]  before Moses
[3596.74 --> 3597.66]  in the presence
[3597.66 --> 3598.20]  of Pharaoh
[3598.20 --> 3599.42]  because of the boils
[3599.42 --> 3600.04]  on them
[3600.04 --> 3601.08]  and maybe that means
[3601.08 --> 3601.64]  they couldn't
[3601.64 --> 3602.62]  reproduce this one.
[3604.18 --> 3605.38]  The seventh plague
[3605.38 --> 3606.18]  brings hail
[3606.18 --> 3607.12]  and begins this
[3607.12 --> 3608.46]  final set of three.
[3609.22 --> 3609.98]  Now the record
[3609.98 --> 3610.62]  and the story
[3610.62 --> 3611.18]  of this plague
[3611.18 --> 3611.74]  is the longest
[3611.74 --> 3613.22]  in the narrative
[3613.22 --> 3615.50]  save for the tenth plague
[3615.50 --> 3616.04]  which includes
[3616.04 --> 3616.54]  the Passover
[3616.54 --> 3617.62]  and here
[3617.62 --> 3618.54]  in this text
[3618.54 --> 3618.94]  you get
[3618.94 --> 3620.18]  the most
[3620.18 --> 3620.88]  explicit
[3620.88 --> 3621.68]  purpose
[3621.68 --> 3622.34]  of God
[3622.34 --> 3622.90]  for all
[3622.90 --> 3623.64]  of these plagues
[3623.64 --> 3624.16]  and so it's
[3624.16 --> 3625.20]  worth looking at
[3625.20 --> 3626.26]  from Exodus 9
[3626.26 --> 3628.00]  verse 14
[3628.00 --> 3628.90]  and 16.
[3630.90 --> 3631.76]  It says
[3631.76 --> 3633.58]  so that you may know
[3633.58 --> 3634.86]  that there is no one
[3634.86 --> 3635.42]  like me
[3635.42 --> 3636.38]  in all the earth
[3636.38 --> 3637.48]  for by now
[3637.48 --> 3637.98]  I could have
[3637.98 --> 3638.92]  stretched out my hand
[3638.92 --> 3639.68]  and struck you
[3639.68 --> 3640.22]  and your people
[3640.22 --> 3640.82]  with a plague
[3640.82 --> 3641.58]  that would have
[3641.58 --> 3642.52]  wiped you off the earth
[3642.52 --> 3644.96]  but I have raised you up
[3644.96 --> 3646.62]  for this very purpose
[3646.62 --> 3648.60]  that I might show you
[3648.60 --> 3649.36]  my power
[3649.36 --> 3650.88]  and that my name
[3650.88 --> 3652.00]  might be proclaimed
[3652.00 --> 3654.20]  in all the earth.
[3655.86 --> 3656.90]  Two things stand out
[3656.90 --> 3657.58]  to me in this
[3657.58 --> 3658.48]  explanation.
[3658.74 --> 3658.96]  One
[3658.96 --> 3661.98]  God has restrained himself
[3661.98 --> 3663.26]  in this
[3663.26 --> 3663.60]  right?
[3663.64 --> 3664.12]  He could have
[3664.12 --> 3665.16]  ended the matter
[3665.16 --> 3666.10]  but he didn't
[3666.10 --> 3667.34]  and it's an interesting
[3667.34 --> 3668.34]  point of grace
[3668.34 --> 3668.90]  actually
[3668.90 --> 3669.80]  in the midst
[3669.80 --> 3670.48]  of this battle.
[3671.30 --> 3671.82]  Two
[3671.82 --> 3673.48]  that God's purpose
[3673.48 --> 3674.48]  in all of this
[3674.48 --> 3675.70]  here is not simply
[3675.70 --> 3677.24]  the release of Israel
[3677.24 --> 3678.56]  from slavery
[3678.56 --> 3679.60]  so that they might go
[3679.60 --> 3680.56]  and worship him
[3680.56 --> 3681.20]  though we have seen
[3681.20 --> 3682.54]  that as the big part
[3682.54 --> 3682.80]  right?
[3683.10 --> 3683.54]  Instead
[3683.54 --> 3684.64]  God sees
[3684.64 --> 3685.68]  that in this
[3685.68 --> 3686.82]  is a fight
[3686.82 --> 3687.52]  is a battle
[3687.52 --> 3688.18]  is a war
[3688.18 --> 3689.36]  that has worldwide
[3689.36 --> 3690.62]  implications.
[3691.62 --> 3692.06]  God says
[3692.06 --> 3693.26]  that I might show you
[3693.26 --> 3693.80]  Pharaoh
[3693.80 --> 3694.88]  my power
[3694.88 --> 3695.90]  and that my name
[3695.90 --> 3696.96]  might be proclaimed
[3696.96 --> 3698.78]  in all the earth
[3698.78 --> 3699.62]  right?
[3699.70 --> 3700.64]  So to Pharaoh
[3700.64 --> 3701.08]  yes
[3701.08 --> 3702.82]  but for all the earth
[3702.82 --> 3703.66]  to know.
[3705.62 --> 3706.94]  The eighth plague
[3706.94 --> 3708.40]  the plague of locusts
[3708.40 --> 3709.44]  takes this purpose
[3709.44 --> 3710.90]  even further
[3710.90 --> 3713.08]  chapter 10
[3713.08 --> 3715.02]  verse 1 and 2
[3715.02 --> 3716.72]  God says
[3716.72 --> 3718.10]  that he is doing
[3718.10 --> 3718.64]  this
[3718.64 --> 3719.72]  so that
[3719.72 --> 3720.88]  I may perform
[3720.88 --> 3721.98]  these signs of mine
[3721.98 --> 3722.56]  among them
[3722.56 --> 3724.18]  that you may tell
[3724.18 --> 3725.00]  your children
[3725.00 --> 3726.00]  and grandchildren
[3726.00 --> 3726.74]  how I dealt
[3726.74 --> 3728.04]  harshly with the Egyptians
[3728.04 --> 3729.60]  and how I performed
[3729.60 --> 3730.96]  my signs among them
[3730.96 --> 3732.50]  that you may
[3732.50 --> 3733.10]  know
[3733.10 --> 3734.06]  that I
[3734.06 --> 3735.14]  am
[3735.14 --> 3736.36]  the Lord.
[3738.24 --> 3738.44]  Right?
[3738.48 --> 3739.18]  Not only is God
[3739.18 --> 3739.82]  doing this
[3739.82 --> 3741.30]  to prove to the Egyptians
[3741.30 --> 3742.60]  his superiority
[3742.60 --> 3744.92]  but so that his own
[3744.92 --> 3745.48]  people
[3745.48 --> 3747.02]  might know
[3747.02 --> 3747.98]  who he is.
[3748.62 --> 3748.82]  Right?
[3748.86 --> 3750.04]  The redemptive actions
[3750.04 --> 3750.52]  of God
[3750.52 --> 3751.22]  in this moment
[3751.22 --> 3752.36]  are going to be
[3752.36 --> 3753.74]  identity shaping
[3753.74 --> 3755.16]  for generations
[3755.16 --> 3756.28]  to come.
[3756.72 --> 3757.44]  Right?
[3757.50 --> 3758.30]  And in the light
[3758.30 --> 3759.36]  of future
[3759.36 --> 3760.16]  struggles
[3760.16 --> 3761.62]  God's work
[3761.62 --> 3762.76]  here and now
[3762.76 --> 3763.98]  in and with
[3763.98 --> 3764.86]  the Egyptians
[3764.86 --> 3766.36]  will be a source
[3766.36 --> 3767.10]  of strength
[3767.10 --> 3768.06]  and comfort
[3768.06 --> 3768.86]  in light of
[3768.86 --> 3769.78]  whatever future
[3769.78 --> 3771.12]  opposition they face.
[3771.40 --> 3771.52]  Right?
[3771.56 --> 3772.16]  In wandering
[3772.16 --> 3773.26]  through the wilderness
[3773.26 --> 3773.94]  the people
[3773.94 --> 3774.72]  will be called
[3774.72 --> 3776.00]  to look back
[3776.00 --> 3776.88]  on this
[3776.88 --> 3777.88]  experience
[3777.88 --> 3778.64]  and remember
[3778.64 --> 3779.60]  what God has done.
[3779.94 --> 3780.56]  In entering
[3780.56 --> 3781.34]  into the land
[3781.34 --> 3782.06]  and having to
[3782.06 --> 3783.54]  expel other nations
[3783.54 --> 3784.46]  they will look back
[3784.46 --> 3785.14]  and remember
[3785.14 --> 3786.48]  what God has done.
[3786.74 --> 3787.18]  Throughout their
[3787.18 --> 3788.70]  captivity and exile
[3788.70 --> 3789.24]  in Babylon
[3789.24 --> 3790.12]  and Persia
[3790.12 --> 3791.60]  they will look back
[3791.60 --> 3792.30]  and remember
[3792.30 --> 3793.56]  this moment
[3793.56 --> 3794.18]  and what God
[3794.18 --> 3794.68]  has done.
[3794.78 --> 3796.18]  When Roman power
[3796.18 --> 3797.28]  is overwhelming
[3797.28 --> 3798.90]  and Jewish identity
[3798.90 --> 3800.62]  is being lost.
[3801.04 --> 3801.12]  Right?
[3801.18 --> 3801.92]  The Messiah
[3801.92 --> 3802.66]  himself
[3802.66 --> 3803.58]  will come
[3803.58 --> 3804.62]  and remind them
[3804.62 --> 3805.22]  of all that
[3805.22 --> 3806.06]  God has done
[3806.06 --> 3807.10]  and will show
[3807.10 --> 3807.60]  them
[3807.60 --> 3809.06]  who his
[3809.06 --> 3809.96]  show them
[3809.96 --> 3811.08]  by his life
[3811.08 --> 3812.02]  in the culmination
[3812.02 --> 3813.04]  of the efforts
[3813.04 --> 3814.10]  of God's work
[3814.10 --> 3815.16]  in the world.
[3816.40 --> 3817.62]  Pictured in Pharaoh
[3817.62 --> 3819.58]  culminating
[3819.58 --> 3820.22]  in the cross.
[3822.10 --> 3823.48]  The ninth plague
[3823.48 --> 3824.50]  ends this
[3824.50 --> 3825.46]  literary cycle
[3825.46 --> 3826.82]  with darkness
[3826.82 --> 3827.96]  falling
[3827.96 --> 3829.30]  on the land.
[3830.86 --> 3831.22]  Again
[3831.22 --> 3832.62]  this plague
[3832.62 --> 3833.14]  is almost
[3833.14 --> 3834.10]  certainly linked
[3834.10 --> 3834.92]  to the Egyptian
[3834.92 --> 3835.82]  sun god
[3835.82 --> 3836.46]  Ra.
[3838.20 --> 3838.40]  Right?
[3838.44 --> 3839.30]  And even
[3839.30 --> 3839.92]  more so
[3839.92 --> 3841.08]  it's not uncommon
[3841.08 --> 3842.36]  for Egyptian kings
[3842.36 --> 3843.28]  to be referred to
[3843.28 --> 3844.40]  as the son of Ra.
[3844.82 --> 3845.38]  And so you will
[3845.38 --> 3846.10]  remember the headdress
[3846.10 --> 3846.64]  from the beginning
[3846.64 --> 3847.22]  that had the symbol
[3847.22 --> 3847.72]  of the Ra
[3847.72 --> 3848.40]  of Ra
[3848.40 --> 3848.84]  and then
[3848.84 --> 3850.00]  of the snake.
[3851.34 --> 3851.72]  Here
[3851.72 --> 3854.22]  the god
[3854.22 --> 3855.34]  of light
[3855.34 --> 3856.50]  and sun
[3856.50 --> 3858.72]  is defeated
[3858.72 --> 3860.08]  with darkness
[3860.08 --> 3860.62]  and yet
[3860.62 --> 3861.20]  this is another
[3861.20 --> 3861.76]  one of those
[3861.76 --> 3862.22]  places
[3862.22 --> 3863.46]  where the region
[3863.46 --> 3864.22]  where the Israelites
[3864.22 --> 3865.36]  lived was not
[3865.36 --> 3865.94]  affected
[3865.94 --> 3867.62]  by the darkness.
[3869.12 --> 3870.00]  Imagine the
[3870.00 --> 3870.64]  possibility
[3870.64 --> 3871.74]  of that
[3871.74 --> 3873.04]  or the impossibility
[3873.04 --> 3874.08]  of how that
[3874.08 --> 3874.62]  might work.
[3875.94 --> 3876.82]  The phrase
[3876.82 --> 3877.32]  actually
[3877.32 --> 3878.28]  rendered
[3878.28 --> 3879.36]  in verse 23
[3879.36 --> 3880.20]  of chapter 10
[3880.20 --> 3881.74]  there was light
[3881.74 --> 3883.24]  in the place
[3883.24 --> 3884.18]  where the Israelites
[3884.18 --> 3884.52]  lived
[3884.52 --> 3885.24]  is an echo
[3885.24 --> 3886.42]  of Genesis 1
[3886.42 --> 3887.30]  verse 3
[3887.30 --> 3887.94]  when God said
[3887.94 --> 3888.80]  let there be
[3888.80 --> 3889.72]  light.
[3890.64 --> 3891.24]  Again
[3891.24 --> 3891.86]  holding out
[3891.86 --> 3893.44]  that contrast
[3893.44 --> 3894.32]  the scope
[3894.32 --> 3895.18]  of this
[3895.18 --> 3896.02]  event.
[3897.52 --> 3897.64]  Now
[3897.64 --> 3897.92]  throughout
[3897.92 --> 3898.76]  these first
[3898.76 --> 3899.76]  nine plagues
[3899.76 --> 3900.56]  two things
[3900.56 --> 3902.00]  become abundantly
[3902.00 --> 3902.44]  clear.
[3903.34 --> 3903.98]  The battle
[3903.98 --> 3904.86]  is between
[3904.86 --> 3906.04]  the true
[3906.04 --> 3906.54]  god
[3906.54 --> 3907.42]  and false
[3907.42 --> 3907.86]  gods
[3907.86 --> 3909.28]  and all
[3909.28 --> 3909.96]  of creation
[3909.96 --> 3910.76]  is the
[3910.76 --> 3911.54]  battleground
[3911.54 --> 3912.62]  and ultimately
[3912.62 --> 3913.82]  all of creation
[3913.82 --> 3914.70]  is what is
[3914.70 --> 3915.40]  at stake.
[3916.38 --> 3917.00]  God is
[3917.00 --> 3917.78]  unleashing
[3917.78 --> 3918.56]  his creative
[3918.56 --> 3919.42]  forces against
[3919.42 --> 3920.32]  all claims
[3920.32 --> 3921.72]  to divinity
[3921.72 --> 3922.52]  and he's
[3922.52 --> 3923.06]  unleashing them
[3923.06 --> 3923.84]  as the one
[3923.84 --> 3924.46]  true god
[3924.46 --> 3925.54]  as the only
[3925.54 --> 3927.02]  true sovereign.
[3927.24 --> 3927.92]  His rule
[3927.92 --> 3928.74]  and reign
[3928.74 --> 3929.26]  and his
[3929.26 --> 3930.04]  absolute
[3930.04 --> 3930.90]  worthiness
[3930.90 --> 3932.04]  to be worshipped
[3932.04 --> 3933.30]  is what
[3933.30 --> 3934.12]  is on display
[3934.12 --> 3934.58]  here.
[3934.58 --> 3937.34]  here's what
[3937.34 --> 3937.82]  I want us
[3937.82 --> 3938.30]  to see
[3938.30 --> 3939.84]  what I think
[3939.84 --> 3940.22]  that all of
[3940.22 --> 3940.76]  this has been
[3940.76 --> 3942.40]  building towards
[3942.40 --> 3944.36]  the plagues
[3944.36 --> 3945.40]  and then
[3945.40 --> 3945.76]  afterwards
[3945.76 --> 3946.28]  of course
[3946.28 --> 3947.16]  the exodus
[3947.16 --> 3949.04]  becomes
[3949.04 --> 3949.56]  the
[3949.56 --> 3950.96]  paradigmatic
[3950.96 --> 3951.66]  event
[3951.66 --> 3952.26]  right
[3952.26 --> 3952.44]  the
[3952.44 --> 3953.40]  identity
[3953.40 --> 3954.54]  defining
[3954.54 --> 3955.30]  event
[3955.30 --> 3955.60]  the
[3955.60 --> 3957.14]  forming
[3957.14 --> 3958.42]  experience
[3958.42 --> 3959.02]  for
[3959.02 --> 3959.84]  the people
[3959.84 --> 3960.38]  of
[3960.38 --> 3961.14]  Israel
[3961.14 --> 3962.34]  this story
[3962.34 --> 3962.98]  and the
[3962.98 --> 3963.36]  victory
[3963.36 --> 3963.96]  of God
[3963.96 --> 3965.02]  this display
[3965.02 --> 3965.98]  of his
[3965.98 --> 3966.70]  power
[3966.70 --> 3967.74]  is what
[3967.74 --> 3967.96]  will
[3967.96 --> 3968.66]  shape
[3968.66 --> 3969.16]  them
[3969.16 --> 3970.00]  for
[3970.00 --> 3970.32]  the
[3970.32 --> 3970.80]  futures
[3970.80 --> 3971.66]  to come.
[3973.12 --> 3973.38]  Remember
[3973.38 --> 3973.86]  all of
[3973.86 --> 3974.24]  this
[3974.24 --> 3974.46]  right
[3974.46 --> 3974.78]  this whole
[3974.78 --> 3975.16]  story
[3975.16 --> 3975.34]  in
[3975.34 --> 3975.72]  exodus
[3975.72 --> 3976.28]  has been
[3976.28 --> 3976.80]  so that
[3976.80 --> 3977.44]  God's
[3977.44 --> 3977.78]  people
[3977.78 --> 3978.08]  can
[3978.08 --> 3978.50]  worship
[3978.50 --> 3978.88]  him
[3978.88 --> 3979.60]  rightly
[3979.60 --> 3980.16]  but
[3980.16 --> 3980.58]  here
[3980.58 --> 3981.02]  it's
[3981.02 --> 3981.50]  also
[3981.50 --> 3982.34]  so much
[3982.34 --> 3982.62]  more
[3982.62 --> 3982.82]  than
[3982.82 --> 3983.14]  that

[3986.36 --> 3986.68]  says
[3986.68 --> 3986.94]  might
[3986.94 --> 3987.28]  show

[3988.48 --> 3988.62]  that
[3988.62 --> 3988.86]  my
[3988.86 --> 3989.22]  name
[3989.22 --> 3989.42]  might
[3989.42 --> 3989.58]  be

[4409.06 --> 4409.48]  worship
[4409.48 --> 4409.74]  them
[4409.74 --> 4410.06]  we
[4410.06 --> 4410.42]  elevate
