[563.40 → 565.40] There are a couple announcements to make
[565.40 → 566.40] First
[566.40 → 568.40] Even though it is the long weekend
[568.40 → 572.40] Pastors class is happening after service today
[572.40 → 574.40] And so if you are part of pastors class
[574.40 → 576.40] Please stick around for that

[605.40 → 607.40] The ascension of Jesus
[607.40 → 613.40] The return of Jesus up to heaven after living, dying, and rising here on earth
[613.40 → 617.40] And so we mark that, and we acknowledge there the kingship of Jesus
[617.40 → 620.40] And so you maybe saw it in the pre-service slide loop

[657.40 → 660.40] And He greets us in His name
[660.40 → 664.40] Grace, mercy, and peace to you
[664.40 → 668.40] From God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, His Son, and our Saviour

[1531.34 → 1533.32] seeking transformation and support
[1533.32 → 1535.92] Wagner Hills started simply with a vision
[1535.92 → 1538.26] to help people on the road to recovery
[1538.26 → 1541.24] find a safe and life-giving place to work
[1541.24 → 1543.72] breathe and escape some of their difficulties
[1543.72 → 1546.86] This vision has blossomed into a thriving ministry
[1546.86 → 1550.04] through which thousands of lives
[1550.04 → 1550.90] have been transformed
[1550.90 → 1554.66] The farm equips men and women recovering from addiction
[1554.66 → 1561.12] with the safety and skills to grow, heal, and lead successful lives after the program
[1561.12 → 1564.64] Their compassionate staff and high-quality educators
[1564.64 → 1569.36] work with the residents to develop a program that sets them up for success
[1569.36 → 1572.62] into their recovery journey
[1572.62 → 1577.82] This program includes goal-setting, skill training on the farm or the office
[1577.82 → 1581.28] professional counselling and a community that believes in them
[1581.28 → 1584.40] From Philippians 4, verses 6-7
[1584.40 → 1586.94] Do not be anxious about anything
[1586.94 → 1591.20] but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving
[1591.20 → 1592.94] present your requests to God
[1592.94 → 1596.54] and the peace of God, which transcends all understanding
[1596.54 → 1599.16] will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus
[1599.16 → 1601.92] Next week's offering is for Team Challenge

[1603.02 → 1621.36] Thank you for joining us

[1622.68 → 1643.50] Holy Spirit, living breath of God
[1643.50 → 1649.40] Breathe new life into my willing soul
[1649.40 → 1657.26] Bring the presence of the risen Lord
[1657.26 → 1663.80] To renew my heart and make me whole
[1663.80 → 1671.72] Cause your word to come alive in me
[1671.72 → 1678.56] Give me faith for what I cannot see
[1678.56 → 1684.70] Give me passion for your purity
[1684.70 → 1691.66] Holy Spirit, breathe new life in me
[1691.66 → 1699.16] Holy Spirit, come abide with me
[1699.16 → 1704.56] May your joy be seen in all I do
[1704.56 → 1712.82] Love enough to cover every sin
[1712.82 → 1717.66] In each thought and deed and attitude
[1717.66 → 1727.04] Guide us to the greatest and the least
[1727.04 → 1733.76] Gentleness that solves the path of peace
[1733.76 → 1739.98] Turn my strivings into words of grace
[1739.98 → 1745.24] Breath of God show Christ in all I do
[1745.24 → 1753.78] Holy Spirit, from creation's birth
[1753.78 → 1760.18] Giving life to all that God has made
[1760.18 → 1767.32] Show your power once again on earth
[1767.32 → 1774.50] Cause your dreams to hunger for your ways
[1774.50 → 1781.72] Let the fragrance of the bears arise
[1781.72 → 1787.18] Lead us on the road of sacrifice
[1787.18 → 1794.56] That in unity the face of Christ
[1794.56 → 1800.18] May be here for all the world to see
[1800.18 → 1809.44] Let the fragrance of our prayers arise
[1809.44 → 1816.70] Lead us on the road of sacrifice
[1816.70 → 1822.94] That in unity the face of Christ
[1822.94 → 1828.70] May be here for all the world to see
[1828.70 → 1846.14] Got some keeners here this morning
[1846.14 → 1847.92] Hey, how about that weather this morning, everybody?
[1848.00 → 1848.82] Isn't that fantastic?
[1850.96 → 1855.54] All right, the next thing I'd like to say is that comment sponsored by Ground Effects Nursery.
[1855.64 → 1858.54] Please go to your local garden centres this week and buy some plants.
[1858.70 → 1865.76] Anyway, we're happy the sun's out. It's great. It was beautiful this morning. Furthermore, it was out earlier. That's great
[1865.76 → 1869.36] Before we get to Kids Corner, I've got to do a little council announcement.
[1869.50 → 1875.38] We had a meeting this week, so I'd just like to give you a little bit of a summary about what we discussed at the meeting.
[1875.52 → 1878.10] First off, we had a report from the elders.
[1878.86 → 1881.94] They did a little bit of research with all the young adults in the church,
[1881.94 → 1887.02] and they gave us a report on the success of that ministry, the work that Josh has been doing.
[1888.10 → 1890.72] And it was very exciting to hear.
[1890.84 → 1896.32] So we heard about that, and we have more information for you at the next council meeting to share with you about that.
[1896.32 → 1899.88] We also had a little bit of time to talk about the nominations.
[1900.06 → 1909.66] We're still short a couple nominations for elder here, so we had a decent conversation about that as to how that's going to transpire over the next little bit here
[1909.66 → 1913.28] as we work our way through the election process.
[1914.42 → 1919.50] We also had some time to hear the pastoral reports from both Chris and Kevin.
[1919.50 → 1922.40] So that was great to hear about what's going on in our community.
[1924.12 → 1927.50] Chris shared with us that he's doing a volunteer training day on June 18th.
[1928.66 → 1932.40] We're going to have time for, there's some training going to happen there,
[1932.50 → 1936.32] and more of just recognition for our volunteers at our church.
[1937.60 → 1940.78] And we're going to have a congregational meeting coming up in June,
[1940.90 → 1943.62] and we're still working the details out on that,
[1943.62 → 1947.36] so more information will come to you through email.
[1947.36 → 1949.92] Thank you very much.
[1951.08 → 1952.76] Kids Corner, do it.
[1959.22 → 1960.44] All right, how's everybody...
[1960.44 → 1962.30] Who is?
[1963.14 → 1964.90] All right, how's everybody doing this morning?
[1965.86 → 1968.16] I want you to finish my sentence.
[1968.76 → 1972.38] When I get up in the morning and the sun is beautiful outside,
[1972.38 → 1975.38] the first thing I want to do when I get outside is...
[1975.38 → 1977.40] Eat.
[1977.78 → 1978.84] Go for a walk.
[1979.12 → 1979.64] What else?
[1979.74 → 1980.58] Anybody else got some...
[1980.58 → 1981.06] Go to the beach.
[1981.12 → 1981.98] Go to the beach.
[1982.06 → 1982.62] Like that one.
[1982.94 → 1983.50] Go swimming?
[1984.70 → 1985.18] Like...
[1985.18 → 1985.54] Go to the pool.
[1986.54 → 1988.84] Is the water still kind of cold, but you're doing it anyway?
[1990.16 → 1990.96] Go to the pool.
[1991.04 → 1991.72] Anybody else?
[1992.60 → 1993.82] Those are great suggestions.
[1993.82 → 2004.34] Today, we're going to do a story and story hour in the back about a young girl who is about your guys' age.
[2004.38 → 2005.42] I'm not really exactly sure.
[2005.52 → 2013.10] She might have been about 10, I think, but about how she helped a general learn about God.
[2013.10 → 2017.18] But before we do that, I want to talk to you guys about something quick.
[2018.92 → 2020.66] I can see all you guys right here.
[2020.74 → 2025.44] You guys are all young and Sunday school age.
[2025.54 → 2030.86] Have you guys ever seen any pictures of your mom or dad when they were your age?
[2032.14 → 2033.00] You haven't?
[2033.06 → 2034.54] What do you think when you see those pictures?
[2034.54 → 2039.36] Are they kind of weird?
[2040.18 → 2040.80] They're kind of weird.
[2041.46 → 2044.66] So, how many of you guys want to see pictures of me when I was your age?
[2046.56 → 2047.42] Are you going to laugh?
[2049.30 → 2049.62] Probably.
[2051.80 → 2052.12] Okay.
[2052.18 → 2054.82] Well, before I do that, I got one more question to ask you guys.
[2054.90 → 2056.86] I got, like, a big birthday coming up tomorrow.
[2056.96 → 2059.06] I want to ask you guys, how old do you think I am?
[2059.80 → 2060.70] Who's got a suggestion?
[2061.14 → 2061.86] Fifteen hundred.
[2062.34 → 2063.06] Fifteen hundred.
[2064.02 → 2064.50] Sixty-five.
[2064.54 → 2064.78] Fifty.
[2067.66 → 2068.06] Fifty.
[2068.78 → 2069.18] Fifty.
[2070.50 → 2071.02] Forty-six.
[2071.18 → 2072.62] Good questions.
[2072.82 → 2073.22] All right.
[2075.18 → 2078.24] Forty years ago, this is what this guy looked like up there.
[2078.30 → 2078.78] Look at that.
[2078.88 → 2079.74] Look at that picture.
[2079.88 → 2080.58] Isn't that good?
[2082.32 → 2082.94] That's me.
[2083.14 → 2083.44] All right.
[2083.48 → 2084.16] We got four of them.
[2084.20 → 2085.22] You can roll the next one.
[2086.04 → 2087.40] Look at that cute kid.
[2087.64 → 2088.62] That's so creepy.
[2091.26 → 2091.92] One more.
[2092.60 → 2094.42] There's me in the middle with my siblings.
[2094.42 → 2097.56] And one more.
[2097.70 → 2098.26] Last one.
[2099.14 → 2099.74] All right.
[2099.80 → 2101.40] There's me at one of my birthday parties.
[2101.84 → 2103.02] Tomorrow I'm turning 50.
[2103.26 → 2104.02] Can't believe it.
[2104.38 → 2104.74] Crazy.
[2107.94 → 2108.58] All right.
[2108.84 → 2111.02] We're going to pray in the back with you guys,
[2111.10 → 2113.00] but we're going to do the blessing for sure this morning,
[2113.08 → 2114.18] so let's all stand up.
[2121.18 → 2121.54] Ready?
[2121.54 → 2121.60] Ready?
[2121.98 → 2122.54] The...
[2122.54 → 2122.88] Thank you.
[2122.92 → 2125.10] Thank you.
[2125.10 → 2125.20] Thank you.
[2127.56 → 2129.16] Thank you.
[2129.30 → 2138.24] Thank you.
[2138.24 → 2142.34] Thank you.
[2142.34 → 2162.60] It's my privilege this morning to lead you in our church family prayer.
[2163.52 → 2167.48] A couple notes before we pray.
[2167.48 → 2171.94] We're going to pray this morning for Louise Rehabs.
[2172.20 → 2173.54] Many of you know her.
[2174.36 → 2181.04] She had an aneurysm, a brain aneurysm last night and is in the hospital and in coma.
[2181.52 → 2189.94] We don't know any further details yet, but we definitely want to uphold her in prayer
[2189.94 → 2193.66] and pray for a miracle of God's healing in her life.
[2193.92 → 2196.78] And so when I pray for that, we will do that.
[2196.78 → 2201.94] I encourage you to keep that in your personal prayers as well this coming week.
[2204.24 → 2211.62] Additionally, I know that maybe we are tired of hearing it in our prayer, but we're going
[2211.62 → 2216.00] to continue to pray for COVID and the impacts on our community.
[2216.60 → 2220.52] There's a number of people in our church family right now who have COVID and are home with
[2220.52 → 2222.24] COVID and struggling with that.
[2222.24 → 2229.86] We are grateful that most of those cases are minor, and yet it's easy to forget or ignore
[2229.86 → 2233.36] and not think intentionally or prayerfully about.
[2233.56 → 2236.20] And so we're going to continue to do that together.
[2236.20 → 2241.32] I invite you to join your hearts with mine as we pray.
[2241.66 → 2242.36] Let's pray together.
[2242.36 → 2253.88] Holy and heavenly Father.
[2253.88 → 2261.34] We come before you on the morning of this day grateful for the beautiful weather, grateful
[2261.34 → 2269.96] for a long weekend, an extra long weekend for some of us kids in school, and we are mindful
[2269.96 → 2273.62] of the many things that we can do as a result of that.
[2273.62 → 2279.84] We are grateful for those and with those who have opportunity to get away, maybe go camping
[2279.84 → 2284.90] or visit with family and friends in other places this long weekend.
[2285.60 → 2288.76] We pray, God, that you would keep them safe as they travel.
[2289.68 → 2296.26] You would bless that time spent relaxing and spent reconnecting with people.
[2297.24 → 2300.96] May it be a deep and real blessing.
[2300.96 → 2308.52] We thank you for the opportunity that many of us had who stayed here to enjoy this long weekend,
[2308.64 → 2315.24] whether that was visiting places or getting some work done around the property or just relaxing
[2315.24 → 2318.58] in community and in fellowship with others.
[2318.70 → 2327.74] We pray, Lord God, that you would restore our hearts and souls through these sorts of times
[2327.74 → 2328.70] and activities.
[2328.70 → 2335.74] We come, God, to worship because we need your restoring power.
[2335.94 → 2341.60] We need to be reminded of who you are and of what you have done in the world.
[2341.80 → 2349.88] And so, Lord God, open the eyes of our hearts to receive you, to welcome more of your spirit
[2349.88 → 2356.70] into ourselves that we might be transformed and that our lives might be changed.
[2356.70 → 2363.42] Stop our stuck ears so that we might hear the truth of your gospel
[2363.42 → 2370.84] and so that we might have the hope that is required to live life in you.
[2370.84 → 2383.14] God, life lived in you is full of reasons for thanksgiving, not necessarily because things are going so well all the time,
[2383.14 → 2387.20] but precisely because you are with us all the time.
[2388.20 → 2390.12] And so we give you thanks for your presence.
[2390.12 → 2398.66] We give you thanks for your nearness in our lives, and we pray that you would help us to experience more and more of you each day.
[2399.18 → 2407.72] That you would help us in worship to recalibrate that experience, to re-familiarize ourselves with your voice as the good shepherd
[2407.72 → 2413.30] and that we might go from this place constantly in praise of you.
[2415.82 → 2421.56] Father God, we know that in your word you call us to pray.
[2422.20 → 2424.20] You call us to lives of prayer.
[2424.66 → 2432.20] You call us to pray for the sick among us, to pray for the hurting and those in need.
[2432.20 → 2439.86] And so, Lord God, with heavy and full hearts, we come to you, and we lift those in need.
[2440.50 → 2448.96] In particular, we cry out with the Rehabs and the Wind and other extended families, and we pray for Louise.
[2450.08 → 2453.04] We pray, Lord God, that you would bring healing to her.
[2454.06 → 2457.34] Restore her with a miracle of your touch.
[2457.34 → 2460.64] Give her, Lord God, all that she needs.
[2460.78 → 2469.82] And as the family comes together and as the family prays, we join our voices with theirs, and we ask that you would sustain them today.
[2470.88 → 2475.70] We don't know what the future holds, Lord God, but we know that you hold the future.
[2476.70 → 2480.26] And so, may we rest in your care.
[2480.94 → 2484.08] May we rest in your hands together.
[2484.08 → 2497.88] Father God, we continue in prayer for those who are recovering from treatments, for those who have had a procedure and are now resting.
[2498.04 → 2498.82] We think of Maria.
[2499.24 → 2511.38] Ask, Lord God, that you would continue to give her what she needs and bring healing to her as she recovers and spends the next three to six months in recovery.
[2511.38 → 2516.28] We pray that you would speed that along and give her all that she needs.
[2517.20 → 2527.38] And God, we pray that you would give her patience and an extra measure of patience so that she might not rush this process and then so prolong it,
[2527.50 → 2533.14] but might do what she has been instructed to from her doctors and those providing care for her.
[2533.40 → 2538.32] And we pray, Lord God, that you would bring healing to her.
[2538.32 → 2548.64] Father God, we know that there are others in our community who have many other illnesses and many other long-term health struggles.
[2548.78 → 2556.66] We pray that you would be near to them, that you would provide for them in meaningful and purposeful ways,
[2556.66 → 2563.54] and that you would use us as your church, that we as a church family, as brothers and sisters in Christ Jesus,
[2563.54 → 2571.04] would meet the needs of those whom we know, and that prayerfully, Lord God, we would meet the needs of those whom we don't know.
[2571.96 → 2575.70] And so work in the world in response to the prayer of your saints.
[2576.56 → 2582.44] To that end, God, we continue in prayer for those who are affected by COVID-19,
[2582.44 → 2585.60] especially for those who are currently sick with it.
[2585.66 → 2594.02] We know that there are a few, and yet we are grateful that the disease itself, the virus itself,
[2594.12 → 2600.54] has seemed to have become less impactful, and we thank you for mild cases.
[2601.00 → 2606.58] And yet, Lord God, we are aware that this is an ongoing and continuing reality,
[2606.58 → 2610.12] and so give us what we need to endure.
[2610.54 → 2615.14] Give us what we need to respond, both responsibly and compassionately,
[2615.60 → 2620.14] and with a sense of Holy Spirit wisdom in the midst of all of this.
[2621.74 → 2625.60] God, we are grateful for the ways that you answer prayer.
[2626.42 → 2631.22] Whether that is time or in medicine or in miracle,
[2631.22 → 2639.08] we pray, Lord God, that you would bring all of our health needs to resolution,
[2639.74 → 2647.00] and that you would restore each who struggles, hurts, and who lives in pain,
[2647.12 → 2649.08] whether physical or emotional.
[2650.60 → 2656.92] Lord our God, as we remember this time of need and prayer,
[2656.92 → 2661.66] we know that your word also calls us to mourn with those who mourn.
[2662.68 → 2668.72] And so, Lord God, alongside of the DeYoung family and the extended family,
[2668.88 → 2672.28] we mourn the loss of Arnold and Joanne,
[2672.78 → 2675.06] members at Gateway Christian Reformed Church,
[2675.20 → 2678.86] and connected to so many in our Christian Reformed,
[2678.96 → 2680.84] but also the Abbotsford community.
[2680.84 → 2685.62] And we pray, Lord God, that you would meet us in our mourning,
[2686.60 → 2688.06] that you would weep with us,
[2688.78 → 2693.02] and that even as our mourning lasts for the night,
[2693.32 → 2695.78] we know that your mercies are new.
[2696.58 → 2700.08] And so we pray, Lord God, that you would lift us up,
[2700.12 → 2702.70] even as we walk through the valley of the shadow,
[2703.10 → 2705.66] may we come into your light.
[2705.80 → 2709.10] May we know your hope in this life.
[2710.84 → 2714.24] Continue in the same vein of prayer for the Alexander family.
[2715.42 → 2719.40] As they continue to mourn the loss of a dad and a grandpa,
[2719.58 → 2721.28] we pray that you, Lord God,
[2721.36 → 2725.98] would bring a measure of peace in this season,
[2726.74 → 2731.48] and that for questions asked and wonderings had,
[2731.86 → 2735.48] we pray, Lord God, that even if we can't find answer,
[2735.48 → 2738.14] even if we can't know the why,
[2738.48 → 2741.08] we can know you in the midst of it.
[2742.44 → 2745.80] Lord, we believe and so help our unbelief.
[2747.26 → 2751.42] We doubt and so grant us more faith.
[2752.64 → 2755.44] We struggle in these moments and days,
[2755.58 → 2757.44] and so give us hope.
[2757.44 → 2761.60] A hope that can only come from the victory of the cross,
[2761.70 → 2764.46] a hope that can only come from the power of the empty tomb,
[2764.82 → 2767.18] a hope that can only come from a Saviour,
[2767.40 → 2769.58] crucified, risen, and ascended,
[2770.06 → 2772.60] who sits at the right hand of God the Father,
[2772.74 → 2774.92] who comes again,
[2775.50 → 2776.34] judge the living.
[2777.66 → 2780.20] So our hope is in your return.
[2780.58 → 2782.50] Our hope is in you.
[2782.50 → 2787.62] God, we pray that you would meet the needs of our church,
[2787.68 → 2791.64] especially as we are looking for men to serve as pastoral elders.
[2792.78 → 2799.14] May you move in the hearts and minds of those people whom you are calling,
[2800.18 → 2804.98] that they would be used by you to lead us into hope,
[2805.76 → 2809.96] to lead us into whatever future you have emerging for us
[2809.96 → 2811.78] as Langley Emanuel Church.
[2812.50 → 2814.40] We are grateful, Lord God,
[2814.46 → 2817.76] for the call that you place on individuals to serve,
[2817.86 → 2820.70] and we ask now that those whom you are calling,
[2820.84 → 2824.44] those men who you are calling to serve as pastoral elders in this season
[2824.44 → 2829.82] would hear your voice and would trust in your equipping to serve.
[2831.72 → 2835.50] It is a privilege to work with you, Lord God.
[2836.16 → 2837.74] We give you thanks for that.
[2837.74 → 2844.68] Thank you that you incorporate us into your plan and will for the world,
[2844.80 → 2849.14] and that you use us as ambassadors of reconciliation,
[2850.22 → 2852.58] ministers of mercy and grace.
[2852.58 → 2857.44] God, we know that we do this work for your glory and with your spirit,
[2857.44 → 2862.96] and so as we come now to your word, fill us up, an experience of both.
[2863.80 → 2867.50] Fill us up by your spirit that we might hear your voice, Lord Jesus,
[2867.66 → 2872.72] and that we might give you praise for who you are and for what you have done.
[2873.42 → 2876.72] Bless Pastor Kevin as he brings your word to us this morning.
[2876.72 → 2880.00] May he speak with boldness and clarity,
[2880.36 → 2885.60] and may he speak your truth directly to our hearts and minds.
[2886.80 → 2888.48] In Christ Jesus we pray.
[2889.28 → 2889.54] Amen.
[2889.54 → 2889.60] Amen.
[2889.60 → 2889.66] Amen.
[2889.66 → 2889.68] Amen.
[2889.68 → 2889.74] Amen.
[2889.74 → 2889.76] Amen.
[2889.76 → 2889.82] Amen.
[2889.82 → 2889.84] Amen.
[2889.84 → 2889.90] Amen.
[2889.90 → 2889.94] Amen.
[2889.94 → 2889.98] Amen.
[2889.98 → 2890.02] Amen.
[2890.02 → 2893.90] Amen.
[2906.72 → 2907.72] Amen.
[2907.72 → 2908.72] Amen.
[2910.72 → 2914.06] Sometimes we forget to think about this when we come into church.
[2914.50 → 2916.50] We have many people here today.
[2916.68 → 2917.98] Many people are not here today.
[2917.98 → 2921.24] We come into this building, some of us feeling immense joy,
[2921.36 → 2922.74] some of us feeling immense sadness.
[2922.94 → 2924.36] There are many emotions in the room.
[2924.50 → 2927.98] We spend time in prayer, acknowledging certain things, rejoicing in some,
[2928.80 → 2932.44] grieving in others, and then we come together to the word of God
[2932.44 → 2938.70] because we know the word of God is true no matter how we are feeling that day.
[2938.80 → 2942.74] And so this has been true these past couple of weeks as well.
[2942.82 → 2944.80] If you've been with us the last couple of weeks,
[2945.18 → 2947.80] you'll know we've been going through a short little sermon series
[2947.80 → 2949.34] that we're actually concluding today.
[2949.86 → 2952.44] If you haven't been with us these past couple of weeks,
[2952.68 → 2954.12] you probably didn't know that.
[2954.78 → 2955.48] But now you do.
[2956.08 → 2958.58] And I thought before we get into our text today,
[2958.94 → 2961.66] it would be fun to do a little bit of a review quiz,
[2961.66 → 2964.32] kind of just to see how we all are doing,
[2964.48 → 2967.16] to see what we've learned from our sermon series so far.
[2967.28 → 2969.32] So there's four sections in this building,
[2969.46 → 2970.70] one, two, three, four.
[2970.88 → 2972.58] I'm going to ask four questions,
[2972.92 → 2973.94] one to each section.
[2974.10 → 2975.70] Each question is a multiple choice,
[2975.84 → 2977.00] and we're going to see how we do.
[2977.06 → 2978.12] And if you're watching online,
[2978.50 → 2980.18] see if you can go four for four here.
[2980.48 → 2982.98] And if you haven't been here with us for the past two weeks
[2982.98 → 2984.84] and have no idea what I'm talking about,
[2985.10 → 2987.46] you'll probably do just fine on this quiz, I think.
[2987.58 → 2988.64] So here we go.
[2989.28 → 2990.90] Question number one to this section right here.
[2990.92 → 2991.30] Are you ready?
[2992.66 → 2994.14] What book have we been working through
[2994.14 → 2995.16] these past couple weeks?
[2995.36 → 2997.82] Has it been 2 Thessalonians, Pride and Prejudice,
[2998.20 → 2999.66] Jude, or all of the above?
[3001.00 → 3002.16] Jude, we're one for one.
[3002.54 → 3003.26] All right, good job.
[3003.36 → 3004.14] That was a lob ball.
[3004.24 → 3004.74] Get us going.
[3005.22 → 3006.66] Question number two to this section.
[3006.78 → 3007.28] Here we go.
[3007.54 → 3009.08] It's a little trickier, but probably not really.
[3009.52 → 3012.04] What is the name of the author of this book
[3012.04 → 3012.98] that we've been looking at?
[3013.02 → 3016.86] Is it Jude, Judas, Judah, or all of the above?
[3018.34 → 3019.42] It is all of the above.
[3019.42 → 3020.82] If you guys did so good, a little bit of trick,
[3020.88 → 3021.82] I would have accepted A.
[3022.14 → 3023.32] I would have given it to you anyway.
[3023.44 → 3024.84] Question number three over here.
[3025.68 → 3026.74] There are a lot of questions about Jude,
[3026.84 → 3027.60] which has guessed the point.
[3028.00 → 3029.12] Who is Jude?
[3029.26 → 3030.00] Third section.
[3030.58 → 3031.18] Some guy.
[3031.90 → 3033.26] Brother of James.
[3033.68 → 3034.84] Half-brother of Jesus.
[3034.84 → 3036.20] Or all of the above?
[3041.40 → 3042.64] A, B, C, D?
[3044.48 → 3045.58] C, it's all of the above.
[3045.68 → 3047.42] It's all the answers you've shouted out is true.
[3047.80 → 3049.16] So you guys got it right as well.
[3049.88 → 3052.76] And number four, easily the hardest question.
[3053.72 → 3056.54] What big word did Pastor Chris teach us about last week?
[3057.48 → 3057.84] Transubstantiation?
[3058.38 → 3058.74] Immutability?
[3059.22 → 3060.96] Anti-disestablishmentarianism?
[3060.96 → 3062.14] Or all of the above?
[3063.68 → 3064.62] Yeah, that's what it is.
[3064.82 → 3065.18] Immutability.
[3065.30 → 3065.88] Good job, Josh.
[3065.90 → 3066.38] You were listening.
[3068.00 → 3068.54] All right.
[3068.72 → 3069.96] So that's the review quiz.
[3070.16 → 3071.32] You guys have all done great.
[3071.64 → 3073.68] I'm sure you're all feeling very grunted right now.
[3074.10 → 3076.22] Grunted, of course, being the opposite of disgruntled,
[3076.40 → 3078.28] which is a word we never use for some reason,
[3078.34 → 3079.06] but I think we should.
[3079.54 → 3080.42] You guys did great.
[3081.38 → 3082.46] Anyway, we've looked at Jude.
[3082.56 → 3084.72] We've looked at the first 23 verses
[3084.72 → 3085.90] over the past two weeks,
[3085.90 → 3087.08] and Chris was kind enough
[3087.08 → 3089.18] to leave me two measly verses at the end
[3089.18 → 3091.60] to conclude this sermon series with.
[3092.02 → 3092.92] That being said,
[3093.30 → 3096.08] these two verses actually pack quite a punch.
[3096.22 → 3098.98] And so whether you've heard the first two sermons or not,
[3099.30 → 3102.44] I'm excited to be able to look at these two verses today as well.
[3102.48 → 3103.86] So if you have your Bibles with you,
[3103.94 → 3104.98] good time to open them up.
[3105.28 → 3106.50] Maybe you've got your Bibles app
[3106.50 → 3107.56] or you've got your Bible memorized.
[3108.14 → 3109.90] Turn with me to your Bibles,
[3110.78 → 3111.34] your apps,
[3111.34 → 3112.00] your brain,
[3112.36 → 3117.10] and read with me verses 24 and 25 this morning.
[3117.58 → 3118.70] It's a short little passage,
[3118.86 → 3119.66] but it's a powerful one.
[3119.72 → 3122.20] Here we read in Jude 24 and 25,
[3122.94 → 3125.32] to him who is to keep you from stumbling
[3125.32 → 3128.10] and to present you before his glorious presence
[3128.10 → 3130.54] without fault and with great joy,
[3131.00 → 3132.64] to the only God our Saviour
[3132.64 → 3136.04] be glory, majesty, power, and authority
[3136.04 → 3138.00] through Jesus Christ our Lord
[3138.00 → 3139.58] before all ages,
[3140.26 → 3142.10] now and forevermore.
[3142.78 → 3143.12] Amen.
[3143.94 → 3145.48] The word of the Lord.
[3146.82 → 3150.18] Now this text exalts Jesus.
[3151.04 → 3153.48] That is the purpose of Jude's final words
[3153.48 → 3154.44] here in his letter.
[3154.50 → 3156.84] Actually, it's the point of Jude's entire letter.
[3157.18 → 3158.36] And what we will come to see today
[3158.36 → 3159.88] is actually the point of this life
[3159.88 → 3162.74] that we are to be living here and now,
[3162.80 → 3165.92] to exalt Jesus above all.
[3166.48 → 3168.42] Jesus is worthy of all glory,
[3168.98 → 3171.60] majesty, power, and authority.
[3171.84 → 3173.06] We've been looking at this theme
[3173.06 → 3174.36] for the past two weeks,
[3174.46 → 3176.18] so we're going to quickly recap that
[3176.18 → 3177.20] as a sort of springboard
[3177.20 → 3179.70] into this doxology that we read today.
[3179.78 → 3181.82] First, we discussed some errant ways,
[3181.94 → 3184.44] some ways that some supposed believers
[3184.44 → 3185.22] throughout history
[3185.22 → 3187.90] and even in our churches today in the West
[3187.90 → 3190.98] have responded poorly to Christ our King.
[3191.32 → 3193.18] Some worldly doctrines have slipped
[3193.18 → 3194.68] into the church throughout history,
[3194.80 → 3195.76] including our present time.
[3195.76 → 3197.28] Things like cheap grace,
[3197.90 → 3198.94] like social good,
[3199.98 → 3201.26] like antinomians,
[3201.48 → 3203.02] which is a word I should have used in the quiz.
[3203.96 → 3206.84] See, some see grace as cheap.
[3207.54 → 3209.64] They believe Jesus died for everything,
[3209.86 → 3212.00] and so now you can do whatever you want
[3212.00 → 3213.76] because God's grace covers it.
[3215.12 → 3216.44] God's grace covers all sin,
[3216.50 → 3217.58] so just live however you like.
[3217.64 → 3218.68] But if people believe this,
[3218.72 → 3221.16] they have this inflated sense of self-worth,
[3221.32 → 3224.14] and they're uninterested in following Christ's command
[3224.14 → 3226.62] to take up your cross and follow him.
[3228.06 → 3228.60] Social good.
[3228.68 → 3230.34] People are bent to a social good.
[3230.64 → 3232.44] They believe that all you need to do to be saved
[3232.44 → 3233.56] is to be a good person,
[3233.56 → 3235.14] but the folly of that, of course,
[3235.22 → 3237.36] is there's no need for Jesus then,
[3237.70 → 3238.48] if that's the case.
[3238.56 → 3240.48] Your salvation is then actually up to you
[3240.48 → 3241.74] and the good that you do.
[3242.74 → 3244.42] I said this word wrong just a second ago,
[3244.48 → 3247.36] but antinominalism is the rejection of all laws.
[3247.44 → 3248.26] Did I get it right that time?
[3248.42 → 3249.12] Still wrong, hey?
[3249.98 → 3250.62] Did I really?
[3250.96 → 3252.50] Oh, I really thought I butchered it the first time.
[3253.58 → 3255.86] Well, that word, it's the rejection of all laws.
[3256.58 → 3259.58] It's this extreme of both points we just talked about.
[3259.64 → 3262.60] These people who believe they owe nobody anything.
[3263.12 → 3264.52] They don't owe anybody anything.
[3264.64 → 3266.52] They're guilty of extreme individualism,
[3266.56 → 3267.68] and to our triune God,
[3267.80 → 3270.28] our triune God who's existed in Father, Son, and Spirit
[3270.28 → 3271.86] throughout time immemorial,
[3272.18 → 3273.52] this is, of course, very insulting,
[3274.06 → 3275.36] and it's not how we are called to live.
[3275.36 → 3277.78] But to counter those false claims,
[3277.98 → 3279.44] we've learned some real truths too.
[3280.00 → 3282.18] We've uncovered that there's no ultimate good
[3282.18 → 3283.14] apart from Jesus.
[3283.72 → 3286.34] We must abide in him to do anything eternally good.
[3286.86 → 3290.62] We've also learned that we are called, kept, and cherished.
[3290.72 → 3291.88] We're called to live for him.
[3292.24 → 3293.56] We're kept by him,
[3293.62 → 3296.02] something that we're going to talk about again today.
[3296.58 → 3298.62] And we're cherished by him.
[3299.12 → 3301.80] Because God is immutable, remember that,
[3302.22 → 3303.76] it means he cannot change.
[3303.76 → 3303.80] Change.
[3304.38 → 3306.34] That means when he says he loves you,
[3306.94 → 3307.50] he loves you.
[3307.58 → 3308.82] That cannot change.
[3309.50 → 3310.78] He cherishes you always,
[3310.88 → 3311.72] no matter your past,
[3311.98 → 3312.68] no matter your present,
[3312.78 → 3313.58] no matter your future,
[3313.96 → 3314.92] no matter what you've done
[3314.92 → 3316.10] or what has been done to you,
[3316.16 → 3318.20] you are cherished by God.
[3319.22 → 3320.62] Because God cannot change.
[3321.88 → 3322.54] And then finally,
[3323.12 → 3324.82] we learn that we must remember his word
[3324.82 → 3326.04] because God remembered us.
[3326.84 → 3328.60] That we will remain in his love
[3328.60 → 3330.50] because he first loved us.
[3330.50 → 3332.38] And that we're called to rescue others
[3332.38 → 3333.90] because he rescued us.
[3335.16 → 3335.96] And then,
[3336.46 → 3337.86] Jude gets to our text today.
[3338.64 → 3340.24] After throwing all of that at us,
[3340.72 → 3342.08] Jude concludes with our text.
[3342.14 → 3343.26] And I'm actually just going to read it for you
[3343.26 → 3343.76] one more time
[3343.76 → 3344.72] because it's so nice and short.
[3345.10 → 3345.32] It says,
[3345.32 → 3347.44] to him who is able to keep you from stumbling
[3347.44 → 3348.76] and to present you
[3348.76 → 3351.60] before his glorious presence
[3351.60 → 3352.98] without fault and with great joy,
[3353.28 → 3354.58] to the only God our Saviour,
[3354.74 → 3357.04] be glory, majesty, power, and authority
[3357.04 → 3359.08] through Jesus Christ our Lord
[3359.08 → 3362.16] before all ages now and forevermore.
[3362.62 → 3362.92] Amen.
[3363.98 → 3366.98] Now there's something about the exaltation of Jesus
[3366.98 → 3367.94] in this passage
[3367.94 → 3370.18] that really needs to resonate with us here.
[3370.38 → 3371.48] Do you see how it's worded?
[3372.14 → 3374.02] Do you look at that last little chunk of this passage?
[3374.02 → 3375.22] It's one long sentence,
[3375.36 → 3376.00] these two verses,
[3376.42 → 3377.18] but it ends with,
[3377.60 → 3379.18] through Jesus Christ our Lord
[3379.18 → 3381.46] before all ages now and forevermore.
[3383.18 → 3383.94] Now we could,
[3384.24 → 3386.24] we could look at that,
[3386.30 → 3386.86] we can understand,
[3386.96 → 3387.78] that's forever, right?
[3387.82 → 3388.48] That's always.
[3389.68 → 3389.90] Right?
[3390.26 → 3392.64] Before all ages now and forevermore.
[3393.80 → 3394.92] So it ends by saying,
[3395.04 → 3395.74] through Jesus,
[3396.62 → 3396.96] always.
[3398.36 → 3400.64] Now we could take this text and reorder it,
[3400.68 → 3401.36] not change it,
[3401.54 → 3403.28] but we could reorder it in this way.
[3403.28 → 3403.70] We could say,
[3403.86 → 3404.36] to Jesus,
[3405.62 → 3407.82] who is always able to keep you from stumbling,
[3408.56 → 3409.18] and who is all,
[3409.28 → 3410.86] and who always presents to you
[3410.86 → 3412.52] before God's glorious presence
[3412.52 → 3413.94] without fault and with great joy,
[3414.60 → 3416.12] to Jesus be all glory,
[3416.78 → 3417.62] majesty, power,
[3418.14 → 3418.80] and authority.
[3419.68 → 3420.00] Amen.
[3421.94 → 3422.36] So you see,
[3422.48 → 3424.54] while this text actually ends with Jesus,
[3424.70 → 3427.00] it really starts with Jesus.
[3427.90 → 3429.98] And isn't that just sort of the beautiful picture
[3429.98 → 3431.16] of faith that we have?
[3431.60 → 3433.16] We can't end with Jesus
[3433.16 → 3434.52] unless we start with Jesus,
[3434.60 → 3435.14] or rather,
[3437.14 → 3437.98] we can't
[3437.98 → 3441.68] end with Jesus
[3441.68 → 3443.62] unless we start with Jesus.
[3443.70 → 3446.34] We can't understand that
[3446.34 → 3448.98] until we understand that Jesus started with us.
[3449.54 → 3451.04] See, it's Jesus who is worthy.
[3452.16 → 3452.96] It's Jesus
[3452.96 → 3455.06] who remembered us in our struggles
[3455.06 → 3456.08] and came to heal us
[3456.08 → 3456.78] from our pain.
[3457.04 → 3457.70] It is Jesus
[3457.70 → 3459.12] who gave up everything
[3459.12 → 3460.44] so that you could be forgiven.
[3460.76 → 3461.42] It's Jesus
[3461.42 → 3462.64] who removes your guilt
[3462.64 → 3463.54] and your shame.
[3463.64 → 3464.14] It's Jesus
[3464.14 → 3465.06] who wept
[3465.06 → 3466.20] when his friend
[3466.20 → 3466.92] died,
[3467.00 → 3467.68] and it's Jesus
[3467.68 → 3468.34] who knows
[3468.34 → 3469.48] how to comfort you
[3469.48 → 3471.08] when you lose someone you love.
[3472.46 → 3473.32] It's Jesus
[3473.32 → 3475.42] who loves you
[3475.42 → 3476.96] more than you will ever know.
[3479.40 → 3480.78] Because of that love,
[3480.86 → 3481.54] it is Jesus
[3481.54 → 3482.56] who made himself
[3482.56 → 3483.54] of no reputation.
[3484.08 → 3485.50] He left the heavenly throne
[3485.50 → 3487.26] and he came to this earth,
[3487.60 → 3488.36] a baby boy,
[3488.44 → 3489.54] where he was scorned
[3489.54 → 3490.62] and he was mocked
[3490.62 → 3491.66] and he was rebuked
[3491.66 → 3492.72] and yet he never sinned
[3492.72 → 3494.16] and he never retaliated.
[3494.58 → 3496.22] And he lived this perfect life
[3496.22 → 3497.28] that we've been called to live,
[3497.48 → 3498.34] but then he died
[3498.34 → 3499.40] a gruesome death,
[3500.34 → 3502.08] as gruesome a death
[3502.08 → 3503.62] that anyone could experience.
[3504.92 → 3505.52] And that's a death
[3505.52 → 3506.34] that you and I deserve.
[3507.90 → 3508.50] He did that
[3508.50 → 3509.56] so that we wouldn't have to.
[3509.90 → 3511.24] And he bore the wrath of God
[3511.24 → 3512.04] that was intended for us
[3512.04 → 3513.34] and he took it with the grave,
[3514.22 → 3515.36] took it to the grave with him.
[3516.10 → 3517.10] But then victoriously,
[3517.82 → 3518.96] he rises from the grave
[3518.96 → 3519.74] three days later
[3519.74 → 3520.74] and he defeats sin
[3520.74 → 3521.82] and death forever
[3521.82 → 3522.86] and provides us all
[3522.86 → 3523.42] with mercy
[3523.42 → 3524.26] and grace
[3524.26 → 3525.14] and forgiveness.
[3525.56 → 3526.84] And all of that he does,
[3527.42 → 3528.44] which we do not deserve.
[3529.50 → 3531.10] And that is the gospel truth.
[3531.80 → 3532.98] That is the gospel truth
[3532.98 → 3533.60] that we remember
[3533.60 → 3534.50] each and every week
[3534.50 → 3535.06] here in church
[3535.06 → 3536.18] and we need to remember
[3536.18 → 3537.24] each and every day
[3537.24 → 3539.28] that starts with Jesus
[3539.28 → 3540.76] so that we can end with Jesus.
[3542.04 → 3543.46] Just like Jude's doxology.
[3546.10 → 3547.42] And now the same Lord
[3547.42 → 3548.10] and Saviour,
[3548.26 → 3549.28] he ascended to heaven,
[3549.82 → 3551.02] which we will remember
[3551.02 → 3551.50] and celebrate
[3551.50 → 3552.24] later this week.
[3553.00 → 3553.98] And now he's sitting
[3553.98 → 3554.94] on the throne of God
[3554.94 → 3555.92] and he's reigning
[3555.92 → 3556.90] over all the cosmos,
[3557.10 → 3558.00] still working in us
[3558.00 → 3558.74] and for us.
[3558.86 → 3560.38] And our text points out
[3560.38 → 3561.84] two ways that he is doing this.
[3562.10 → 3563.04] Two ways that he is still
[3563.04 → 3564.46] intervening in our lives.
[3565.60 → 3566.02] If you look there,
[3566.06 → 3566.30] it says,
[3566.30 → 3567.24] Jesus keeps us
[3567.24 → 3567.88] from stumbling
[3567.88 → 3571.02] and Jesus presents us
[3571.02 → 3571.64] blameless
[3571.64 → 3572.78] before the throne of God.
[3573.68 → 3574.06] And we'll look at
[3574.06 → 3574.66] both of those today
[3574.66 → 3575.02] for a minute.
[3576.02 → 3576.32] First,
[3576.48 → 3577.38] Jesus keeps us
[3577.38 → 3578.26] from stumbling.
[3579.84 → 3580.62] And perhaps it's easy
[3580.62 → 3581.16] to read this
[3581.16 → 3581.68] with a little bit
[3581.68 → 3582.64] of a limited scope
[3582.64 → 3583.76] and we question
[3583.76 → 3584.34] this statement.
[3585.28 → 3585.86] You might be thinking,
[3585.96 → 3586.46] does he actually
[3586.46 → 3587.54] keep me from stumbling?
[3587.62 → 3588.48] Because I mess up
[3588.48 → 3589.02] all the time.
[3590.72 → 3591.36] The thing is,
[3591.38 → 3592.24] this isn't a statement
[3592.24 → 3593.78] about your sin.
[3594.62 → 3595.56] This is a statement
[3595.56 → 3597.32] about your salvation.
[3599.02 → 3600.34] This isn't about your sin,
[3600.42 → 3601.30] it's about your salvation.
[3601.58 → 3602.18] When you pair
[3602.18 → 3602.98] this first statement
[3602.98 → 3603.64] that he keeps us
[3603.64 → 3604.26] from stumbling
[3604.26 → 3605.82] with Jude's second statement
[3605.82 → 3607.48] that Jesus presents us
[3607.48 → 3607.96] blameless
[3607.96 → 3609.22] to the throne above,
[3609.44 → 3610.60] we realize Jude isn't
[3610.60 → 3611.12] talking about
[3611.12 → 3612.34] everyday stuff right here.
[3613.24 → 3613.80] He isn't talking
[3613.80 → 3614.94] about the moment-to-moment
[3614.94 → 3615.82] mess that we might
[3615.82 → 3616.78] create sometimes.
[3617.42 → 3618.98] This is an eternal
[3618.98 → 3620.38] spectrum remark.
[3620.96 → 3621.82] Jesus keeps us
[3621.82 → 3622.88] from stumbling
[3622.88 → 3623.96] eternally.
[3624.06 → 3624.68] Our salvation
[3624.68 → 3625.86] is assured.
[3631.30 → 3632.14] We can put it
[3632.14 → 3632.78] a different way.
[3634.94 → 3636.04] Our salvation
[3636.04 → 3637.98] is certain
[3637.98 → 3639.62] to those who believe.
[3640.50 → 3641.62] This is a text
[3641.62 → 3642.86] about the perseverance
[3642.86 → 3643.82] of the saints.
[3644.26 → 3645.22] Once you're saved,
[3645.56 → 3646.24] you're saved.
[3646.54 → 3647.16] Once the Spirit
[3647.16 → 3648.10] opens your heart
[3648.10 → 3648.90] to the promises
[3648.90 → 3649.46] of God
[3649.46 → 3650.32] and you've been given
[3650.32 → 3651.24] the gift of faith,
[3651.24 → 3653.34] faith,
[3653.34 → 3655.62] you cannot not
[3655.62 → 3656.40] believe it forever.
[3658.56 → 3659.12] Again,
[3659.18 → 3659.72] this goes back
[3659.72 → 3661.66] to the immutability
[3661.66 → 3662.32] of God.
[3662.70 → 3664.20] God cannot change.
[3664.48 → 3665.08] His promises
[3665.08 → 3666.26] cannot change either.
[3666.80 → 3667.92] Once you've experienced
[3667.92 → 3668.56] or understood
[3668.56 → 3670.04] or had the truth
[3670.04 → 3670.88] of the love
[3670.88 → 3671.44] and the grace
[3671.44 → 3672.34] of Jesus Christ
[3672.34 → 3673.16] revealed to you,
[3673.42 → 3674.10] your salvation
[3674.10 → 3674.72] is assured.
[3674.72 → 3676.82] Jesus keeps you
[3676.82 → 3677.98] from stumbling.
[3678.76 → 3679.66] But we do doubt
[3679.66 → 3680.30] this sometimes,
[3680.40 → 3680.76] don't we?
[3681.40 → 3682.16] And it makes sense.
[3682.30 → 3682.94] We doubt it.
[3682.98 → 3683.78] It's okay to doubt
[3683.78 → 3684.30] things.
[3684.54 → 3685.06] It takes faith
[3685.06 → 3685.44] to doubt,
[3685.52 → 3685.80] actually.
[3685.94 → 3687.26] And it takes
[3687.26 → 3687.88] curiosity
[3687.88 → 3688.86] to seek answers.
[3688.86 → 3690.26] When we question
[3690.26 → 3690.78] or we doubt
[3690.78 → 3691.86] the existence of God
[3691.86 → 3692.22] or the way
[3692.22 → 3692.92] that he operates
[3692.92 → 3693.44] in this world,
[3693.52 → 3694.08] the best advice
[3694.08 → 3695.02] is to keep questioning.
[3695.86 → 3696.52] That's always
[3696.52 → 3697.24] the right answer.
[3697.30 → 3698.02] But there are reasons
[3698.02 → 3698.78] why we doubt
[3698.78 → 3699.60] this promise.
[3700.86 → 3701.42] We think about
[3701.42 → 3703.00] the preservation
[3703.00 → 3704.00] of the saints,
[3705.00 → 3705.70] once saved,
[3705.80 → 3706.58] always saved,
[3707.02 → 3707.96] and we think about
[3707.96 → 3708.78] people that we know
[3708.78 → 3709.70] who have walked
[3709.70 → 3710.44] away from the faith.
[3713.14 → 3714.54] But when we do this,
[3714.68 → 3716.04] we inadvertently
[3716.04 → 3716.96] give mankind
[3716.96 → 3718.30] too much credit.
[3719.30 → 3720.56] We start believing
[3720.56 → 3721.92] that we have something
[3721.92 → 3723.20] to do with our salvation,
[3724.26 → 3725.02] as if salvation
[3725.02 → 3725.44] is something
[3725.44 → 3726.90] that can be granted
[3726.90 → 3727.66] and removed
[3727.66 → 3729.12] because of our actions
[3729.12 → 3730.08] or the decisions
[3730.08 → 3731.12] that we make.
[3732.34 → 3733.46] But that can't be.
[3734.66 → 3736.16] People can't fall away
[3736.16 → 3737.50] from Jesus' saving grace.
[3737.60 → 3738.10] And here's why.
[3739.36 → 3741.20] Salvation is forever.
[3741.92 → 3742.46] Because again,
[3742.56 → 3743.64] God is unchanging.
[3744.40 → 3746.66] God's love cannot change.
[3747.28 → 3748.42] And then God's salvation
[3748.42 → 3749.64] cannot change.
[3750.80 → 3752.96] Salvation is eternal.
[3753.14 → 3753.80] By definition,
[3754.04 → 3754.56] it has to be.
[3754.64 → 3755.62] We are being saved
[3755.62 → 3756.54] for eternity
[3756.54 → 3757.64] or being saved
[3757.64 → 3759.52] from eternal damnation.
[3760.22 → 3761.38] But if salvation
[3761.38 → 3762.50] can be lost,
[3763.50 → 3764.72] if it's something
[3764.72 → 3766.24] we can fall away from,
[3766.78 → 3767.88] we've now made it
[3767.88 → 3769.04] not eternal.
[3771.08 → 3772.34] If I can lose it,
[3772.40 → 3773.18] it's not everlasting.
[3774.88 → 3775.20] Furthermore,
[3775.34 → 3776.50] if I can walk my way
[3776.50 → 3777.30] out of salvation,
[3777.70 → 3778.66] or if I can work
[3778.66 → 3779.76] my way out of salvation,
[3779.88 → 3780.80] or if I can decide
[3780.80 → 3781.90] my way out of salvation,
[3782.84 → 3784.04] my salvation now
[3784.04 → 3785.04] is ultimately dependent
[3785.04 → 3785.90] on me,
[3787.22 → 3788.08] not on Jesus.
[3791.92 → 3792.62] Salvation is not
[3792.62 → 3793.14] an allowance
[3793.14 → 3793.70] that we get
[3793.70 → 3794.66] as long as we do the work.
[3795.54 → 3796.00] An allowance
[3796.00 → 3796.82] that we stop getting
[3796.82 → 3797.64] if we stop working.
[3798.98 → 3799.80] Salvation is given
[3799.80 → 3800.84] to those
[3800.84 → 3802.10] who believe in Jesus
[3802.10 → 3802.90] and true faith
[3802.90 → 3803.78] can't be lost.
[3804.92 → 3805.84] And so he keeps you.
[3805.94 → 3806.48] The Greek word
[3806.48 → 3807.70] in this text here is,
[3807.96 → 3808.28] and man,
[3808.34 → 3808.68] I'm going to butcher
[3808.68 → 3809.18] this one too,
[3809.56 → 3810.18] folios
[3810.18 → 3811.04] is what it's called
[3811.04 → 3811.46] probably.
[3811.46 → 3813.06] But the word
[3813.06 → 3813.54] that I probably
[3813.54 → 3814.18] can't pronounce
[3814.18 → 3815.84] means to guard
[3815.84 → 3818.44] or to watch over.
[3819.20 → 3820.64] So Jesus is at his post
[3820.64 → 3821.84] and he's standing guard
[3821.84 → 3823.48] and he's standing watch
[3823.48 → 3823.96] over those
[3823.96 → 3824.78] who have put their faith
[3824.78 → 3825.32] in him
[3825.32 → 3826.32] and he's keeping them
[3826.32 → 3827.48] from stumbling
[3827.48 → 3828.82] eternally.
[3829.24 → 3829.54] Now again,
[3829.64 → 3830.62] don't minimize this
[3830.62 → 3831.28] by thinking about
[3831.28 → 3832.44] the little individual sins
[3832.44 → 3833.20] that you may commit.
[3833.48 → 3834.02] But understand,
[3834.14 → 3835.28] Jesus is keeping us
[3835.28 → 3836.96] for eternity.
[3837.16 → 3837.94] He guards us
[3837.94 → 3838.66] like shepherds
[3838.66 → 3839.54] guard his sheep.
[3839.54 → 3841.20] Jesus says in John 10,
[3841.28 → 3842.10] 27 to 29,
[3842.18 → 3842.54] he says this,
[3842.78 → 3843.04] he says,
[3843.14 → 3844.58] my sheep listen
[3844.58 → 3845.70] to my voice.
[3846.42 → 3847.32] I know them
[3847.32 → 3848.20] and they follow me.
[3848.92 → 3850.98] I give them eternal life
[3850.98 → 3852.76] and they shall never perish.
[3852.92 → 3854.10] No one will snatch them
[3854.10 → 3854.78] out of my hand.
[3856.06 → 3857.36] My Father who has given them
[3857.36 → 3859.00] to me is greater than all.
[3859.72 → 3861.06] No one can snatch them
[3861.06 → 3863.42] out of my Father's hands.
[3864.06 → 3866.00] See, salvation belongs
[3866.00 → 3866.96] to our God.
[3867.76 → 3868.42] Not to you,
[3868.42 → 3870.60] and not once you're saved,
[3870.68 → 3872.32] you're always saved.
[3873.36 → 3873.92] Now take that in
[3873.92 → 3874.36] for a moment.
[3874.76 → 3875.68] Don't think about
[3875.68 → 3876.72] the people around you
[3876.72 → 3877.44] or people that you think
[3877.44 → 3878.02] needs to hear
[3878.02 → 3878.76] about this right now.
[3878.98 → 3880.00] We all need to hear
[3880.00 → 3880.64] this good news.
[3881.00 → 3882.24] Your salvation
[3882.24 → 3883.48] is certain.
[3885.02 → 3886.14] It is assured.
[3886.96 → 3887.78] The great shepherd
[3887.78 → 3888.56] is guarding you.
[3888.66 → 3889.90] He will keep you
[3889.90 → 3891.52] for him forever.
[3893.02 → 3893.96] Because of Jesus,
[3894.20 → 3895.28] you are saved.
[3895.36 → 3896.06] You can't earn it.
[3896.26 → 3897.10] You can't buy it.
[3897.10 → 3898.04] You can't rent it
[3898.04 → 3898.62] for a weekend.
[3899.12 → 3900.66] Salvation cannot be lost.
[3900.78 → 3901.66] It cannot be found.
[3901.92 → 3903.06] It cannot be thrown away.
[3903.36 → 3904.06] It is kept.
[3904.36 → 3906.20] And you are kept.
[3906.86 → 3907.14] Amen?
[3908.22 → 3908.84] There's more.
[3909.94 → 3911.06] Jesus obtained
[3911.06 → 3911.94] your salvation
[3911.94 → 3912.64] on the cross.
[3912.74 → 3913.46] He obtained
[3913.46 → 3914.72] your salvation.
[3916.04 → 3918.02] But now he maintains it
[3918.02 → 3918.64] as well
[3918.64 → 3920.10] from the throne above.
[3920.10 → 3921.00] As our text says,
[3921.38 → 3922.74] Jesus presents you
[3922.74 → 3924.58] before his glorious presence
[3924.58 → 3925.74] without fault
[3925.74 → 3927.58] and with great joy.
[3927.86 → 3928.96] He presents you
[3928.96 → 3930.02] blameless
[3930.02 → 3931.24] before the throne.
[3932.18 → 3932.98] I think we can
[3932.98 → 3934.02] shortchange this too
[3934.02 → 3934.78] to be honest with you.
[3935.04 → 3935.94] I relearned about
[3935.94 → 3937.04] double imputation
[3937.04 → 3937.68] this week.
[3938.16 → 3939.18] Double imputation.
[3939.32 → 3939.66] Theology.
[3939.78 → 3940.12] Big words.
[3940.20 → 3941.32] See, I know some big words too, Chris.
[3942.28 → 3942.84] Sometimes
[3942.84 → 3944.28] when we think
[3944.28 → 3945.30] about being
[3945.30 → 3946.06] forgiven
[3946.06 → 3947.30] by God's grace,
[3947.30 → 3949.96] we don't grasp
[3949.96 → 3950.82] the full magnitude
[3950.82 → 3951.46] of this.
[3952.70 → 3953.58] I'm going to
[3953.58 → 3954.10] riskily
[3954.10 → 3955.18] let capitalism
[3955.18 → 3956.02] illustrate this
[3956.02 → 3956.48] for a moment,
[3956.58 → 3957.48] so bear with me here.
[3957.54 → 3958.10] I think actually
[3958.10 → 3958.82] Al used this
[3958.82 → 3959.22] in a sermon
[3959.22 → 3959.92] a few years back,
[3959.98 → 3960.44] so it might sound
[3960.44 → 3961.34] familiar to some of you.
[3962.64 → 3963.64] In our sin,
[3964.32 → 3965.46] it's like we owe a debt.
[3965.62 → 3966.84] Let's save a million dollars.
[3967.84 → 3968.98] But with the cross
[3968.98 → 3969.88] and the empty tomb,
[3970.06 → 3970.68] Jesus came
[3970.68 → 3971.78] and cancelled our debt.
[3973.02 → 3974.18] That's how we think
[3974.18 → 3974.84] of God's grace
[3974.84 → 3975.68] and forgiveness here.
[3975.94 → 3976.36] And I think
[3976.36 → 3977.28] when we think of this,
[3977.28 → 3977.74] we do think
[3977.74 → 3978.40] that's amazing.
[3978.60 → 3979.60] I would have never been able
[3979.60 → 3980.54] to pay off that debt
[3980.54 → 3982.38] and Jesus took it from me.
[3983.70 → 3984.68] The thing is,
[3984.80 → 3986.28] if we owe a million dollars
[3986.28 → 3987.24] and that debt's forgiven,
[3987.34 → 3988.10] what are we left with?
[3989.12 → 3990.28] If you have negative
[3990.28 → 3991.28] a million dollars
[3991.28 → 3992.14] and you're given
[3992.14 → 3992.90] a million dollars
[3992.90 → 3993.92] to pay off that debt,
[3994.14 → 3994.98] what are you left with?
[3996.04 → 3996.44] Nothing.
[3998.34 → 3998.58] Church,
[3998.64 → 3999.48] God's grace and mercy
[3999.48 → 4000.94] is so much more than this.
[4002.16 → 4002.38] You see,
[4002.44 → 4003.12] not only does Jesus
[4003.12 → 4004.14] take away our sin,
[4004.38 → 4005.08] take away our debt,
[4005.08 → 4007.00] He makes us righteous.
[4007.82 → 4008.60] He not only covers
[4008.60 → 4009.56] the million dollar debt,
[4009.74 → 4010.48] but He gives you
[4010.48 → 4011.28] a million dollars
[4011.28 → 4012.08] on top of that.
[4012.34 → 4013.26] That's almost
[4013.26 → 4014.64] an entire down payment
[4014.64 → 4015.82] on a small condo
[4015.82 → 4016.84] on the outskirts
[4016.84 → 4017.54] of the GVA.
[4017.80 → 4018.48] I should have used
[4018.48 → 4019.28] bigger increments
[4019.28 → 4020.06] for this example.
[4020.06 → 4022.48] point is,
[4023.10 → 4024.50] not only is your debt forgiven,
[4025.38 → 4026.42] not only is your sins
[4026.42 → 4026.96] are forgiven,
[4027.54 → 4028.38] but you are given
[4028.38 → 4029.50] the gift of righteousness,
[4029.72 → 4031.42] given a greater inheritance,
[4031.68 → 4033.14] more than your debt
[4033.14 → 4033.74] ever was.
[4034.92 → 4035.62] You're not simply
[4035.62 → 4036.62] made even,
[4036.74 → 4037.62] you're made holy.
[4038.48 → 4039.32] That's what double
[4039.32 → 4040.28] imputation means.
[4040.52 → 4041.26] You've been imputed,
[4041.36 → 4042.12] you've been assigned
[4042.12 → 4043.06] both forgiveness
[4043.06 → 4043.98] and righteousness.
[4044.44 → 4045.08] You've been given
[4045.08 → 4045.90] both mercy
[4045.90 → 4047.08] and glory.
[4048.32 → 4049.20] You are presented
[4049.20 → 4050.12] blameless
[4050.12 → 4051.20] in the presence
[4051.20 → 4052.22] of God.
[4052.78 → 4053.86] Not simply forgiven,
[4054.84 → 4055.60] blameless.
[4056.94 → 4058.64] You are without fault.
[4062.44 → 4063.08] Jesus looks at you
[4063.08 → 4063.72] with great joy,
[4064.36 → 4065.68] and when God looks at you,
[4065.76 → 4066.48] He sees Christ.
[4066.48 → 4067.36] Church,
[4069.62 → 4070.62] this is the unbelievable
[4070.62 → 4071.60] news of the gospel.
[4072.60 → 4073.74] This is the good news
[4073.74 → 4074.38] that Jude wants
[4074.38 → 4075.12] his readers to hear.
[4075.18 → 4076.06] He wants you to know
[4076.06 → 4078.02] this truth,
[4078.36 → 4080.14] so that we will respond
[4080.14 → 4081.70] in the only way we can,
[4082.76 → 4083.52] with praise,
[4084.90 → 4086.48] with a doxology
[4086.48 → 4087.28] to our Saviour.
[4088.86 → 4089.68] Pastor Chris said this
[4089.68 → 4090.46] in a previous sermon,
[4090.58 → 4091.48] but good theology
[4091.48 → 4092.80] leads to doxology.
[4093.62 → 4094.86] Doxology is expressions
[4094.86 → 4095.86] of gratitude
[4095.86 → 4096.88] gratitude and praise,
[4097.00 → 4097.80] knowing that we are
[4097.80 → 4098.14] forgiven,
[4098.32 → 4099.32] knowing that we are
[4099.32 → 4100.06] made righteous,
[4100.24 → 4101.64] knowing that our salvation
[4101.64 → 4103.42] is assured and eternal,
[4103.52 → 4104.08] that we are seen
[4104.08 → 4105.66] blameless in God's eyes
[4105.66 → 4106.62] despite the lives
[4106.62 → 4107.36] that you and I
[4107.36 → 4108.12] both know we live.
[4109.02 → 4109.76] That can only be
[4109.76 → 4110.94] responded to in one way,
[4111.02 → 4111.22] right?
[4112.74 → 4113.96] When we grasp
[4113.96 → 4115.50] even a chunk
[4115.50 → 4116.48] of the magnitude
[4116.48 → 4118.02] of what He has done
[4118.02 → 4118.40] for us,
[4118.52 → 4119.40] and the surety
[4119.40 → 4120.14] that we have
[4120.14 → 4121.48] in the promises of God,
[4121.66 → 4122.80] our scope of reality
[4122.80 → 4123.52] should change.
[4123.52 → 4125.16] Our praise
[4125.16 → 4126.08] should just flow
[4126.08 → 4126.82] out of us.
[4129.38 → 4130.30] A couple of years ago,
[4130.42 → 4131.40] my brother-in-law
[4131.40 → 4132.78] invited Nicky and I
[4132.78 → 4133.94] on a flight,
[4134.20 → 4134.92] to go on a flight.
[4134.98 → 4135.80] He's a pilot now,
[4135.88 → 4136.78] but a few years ago,
[4136.84 → 4137.28] I guess he needed
[4137.28 → 4138.08] more air time,
[4138.16 → 4138.82] so he needed to get up
[4138.82 → 4139.40] in the air a little bit
[4139.40 → 4139.76] more often,
[4140.16 → 4141.02] or he was just being
[4141.02 → 4141.48] super nice,
[4141.54 → 4141.82] I don't know.
[4141.86 → 4142.48] But he invited Nicky
[4142.48 → 4143.14] and I on this flight
[4143.14 → 4144.00] in a little four-seater
[4144.00 → 4144.40] airplane,
[4144.80 → 4145.28] and we were allowed
[4145.28 → 4146.22] to take one of our kids.
[4146.90 → 4147.94] So we left our oldest
[4147.94 → 4148.56] and our youngest
[4148.56 → 4149.54] at home with Grandma,
[4149.66 → 4150.46] and we took Isla,
[4150.58 → 4151.18] our middle kid,
[4151.18 → 4151.70] with us,
[4151.80 → 4152.58] and she got to come
[4152.58 → 4153.30] and sit in the back
[4153.30 → 4154.08] corner of this little
[4154.08 → 4154.92] four-seater airplane.
[4155.28 → 4155.92] She was maybe five
[4155.92 → 4156.30] at the time.
[4157.34 → 4158.16] Because it was a small
[4158.16 → 4158.42] plane,
[4158.48 → 4159.04] we had to put on
[4159.04 → 4160.26] those cool headphones
[4160.26 → 4161.40] with the sets
[4161.40 → 4161.86] so that we could
[4161.86 → 4162.44] talk to each other
[4162.44 → 4163.28] because it was super loud,
[4163.54 → 4164.18] and so that Jared
[4164.18 → 4165.08] could talk to the tower
[4165.08 → 4165.82] and to the other planes
[4165.82 → 4166.32] in the area.
[4167.32 → 4168.20] And then we took off,
[4168.42 → 4169.38] and our plane is going up,
[4169.42 → 4169.88] and it's loud,
[4169.94 → 4170.58] and we're getting higher
[4170.58 → 4170.88] and higher,
[4170.94 → 4171.86] and it's such a cool night,
[4171.96 → 4172.54] and Jared's trying
[4172.54 → 4173.44] to talk to the tower
[4173.44 → 4174.08] to communicate
[4174.08 → 4174.96] what he needs to communicate,
[4175.34 → 4176.14] but he gets interrupted
[4176.14 → 4176.90] every four seconds
[4176.90 → 4177.80] by this little tiny,
[4177.90 → 4178.38] girly voice
[4178.38 → 4178.94] in the back corner
[4178.94 → 4179.62] of the plane going,
[4180.06 → 4184.58] wow, wow, wow,
[4185.48 → 4186.62] every four seconds,
[4186.92 → 4190.50] wow, wow, wow.
[4190.54 → 4192.80] She started to see her world
[4192.80 → 4194.70] from this different perspective.
[4195.74 → 4196.68] She started to realize
[4196.68 → 4197.58] the magnitude
[4197.58 → 4199.24] of the Fraser Valley,
[4199.34 → 4200.90] the beauty of the view,
[4200.98 → 4202.08] and the joy of rising
[4202.08 → 4202.82] and above it all
[4202.82 → 4203.76] just filled her up.
[4204.56 → 4205.68] Jared couldn't communicate
[4205.68 → 4208.52] to the, wow, wow,
[4208.94 → 4211.00] over and over and over again.
[4213.74 → 4214.94] That's our response
[4214.94 → 4216.60] to what Jesus has done for us.
[4217.86 → 4219.06] When we understand
[4219.06 → 4220.34] all Jesus has done for us,
[4220.40 → 4221.12] our response just,
[4221.38 → 4224.78] it can only be, wow, wow.
[4226.36 → 4227.46] And it's not just
[4227.46 → 4229.16] when things hit home
[4229.16 → 4229.96] and we're on these
[4229.96 → 4230.64] spiritual highs
[4230.64 → 4231.54] and things are going good
[4231.54 → 4232.26] that we praise him.
[4233.22 → 4234.42] When life is hard,
[4235.42 → 4237.42] we can rejoice in his name
[4237.42 → 4238.92] because honestly,
[4240.04 → 4240.98] our only hope
[4240.98 → 4241.92] in hard times is him.
[4243.92 → 4245.06] Our only hope
[4245.06 → 4245.90] in hard times
[4245.90 → 4247.44] is that he is ruling
[4247.44 → 4248.10] over everything.
[4251.70 → 4252.74] It's why worshipping
[4252.74 → 4253.28] is done
[4253.28 → 4254.54] at weddings
[4254.54 → 4256.06] and at funerals,
[4256.22 → 4257.04] at baptisms
[4257.04 → 4258.48] and at memorials.
[4258.48 → 4263.76] when life is hard,
[4263.86 → 4264.52] we can sing,
[4264.52 → 4266.14] it is well with my soul
[4266.14 → 4268.20] and we just feel
[4268.20 → 4269.56] God's arms around our heart,
[4269.64 → 4269.92] don't we?
[4270.02 → 4271.26] When the weight of shame
[4271.26 → 4271.80] and guilt
[4271.80 → 4274.08] is weighing on our shoulders
[4274.08 → 4275.98] and we sing amazing grace,
[4276.98 → 4278.22] man, we can grasp
[4278.22 → 4279.26] how true and infinite
[4279.26 → 4280.34] God's grace is
[4280.34 → 4281.92] and how free we are
[4281.92 → 4282.62] from our sins.
[4282.98 → 4284.74] And when a pandemic ends
[4284.74 → 4286.10] and our church is allowed
[4286.10 → 4287.56] to gather together again,
[4287.90 → 4289.22] uninhibited by anything,
[4289.34 → 4291.04] and we can sing the song,
[4291.38 → 4292.84] Oh, praise the name
[4292.84 → 4294.36] of the Lord our God.
[4294.92 → 4295.94] It moves us to tears.
[4298.00 → 4299.10] I see good theology
[4299.10 → 4301.36] leads to doxology.
[4301.70 → 4302.58] Knowing what God
[4302.58 → 4303.48] has done for us
[4303.48 → 4305.24] leads us to praise him.
[4305.44 → 4306.56] And it's not just singing
[4306.56 → 4308.10] to him,
[4308.52 → 4309.16] though we should
[4309.16 → 4309.78] and we will
[4309.78 → 4310.90] and we will continue to,
[4311.72 → 4313.38] but it's living lives
[4313.38 → 4314.40] of praise for him.
[4314.40 → 4316.02] See, praise then becomes
[4316.02 → 4316.68] our mission.
[4318.06 → 4319.86] Our mission is to praise him.
[4320.78 → 4322.22] When the Israelites
[4322.22 → 4322.90] were in Exodus,
[4323.40 → 4324.24] God told Moses
[4324.24 → 4325.14] to lead his people
[4325.14 → 4325.64] out of Egypt
[4325.64 → 4326.30] so they could what?
[4327.14 → 4327.84] Worship him.
[4328.60 → 4329.36] When his people
[4329.36 → 4330.20] were in exile
[4330.20 → 4331.76] in Babylon and Persia,
[4331.82 → 4332.70] they were told to go back
[4332.70 → 4333.54] and rebuild the walls
[4333.54 → 4334.38] in the temple to what?
[4335.56 → 4336.28] Worship him.
[4336.66 → 4337.18] To praise him.
[4337.38 → 4338.04] When Jesus came
[4338.04 → 4338.70] into this world
[4338.70 → 4339.82] and lived the life
[4339.82 → 4340.44] we should have lived
[4340.44 → 4341.24] and died the death
[4341.24 → 4341.98] we deserve to die
[4341.98 → 4342.96] and then rose again
[4342.96 → 4343.84] for all the cosmos,
[4343.84 → 4344.82] what does he call us
[4344.82 → 4345.20] to do?
[4346.34 → 4347.08] Worship him.
[4348.40 → 4349.36] Our lives,
[4349.50 → 4350.18] our calling,
[4350.30 → 4351.02] our mission
[4351.02 → 4352.58] is to praise him.
[4352.78 → 4353.64] More than anything,
[4354.04 → 4354.62] we are called
[4354.62 → 4355.88] to respond to the gifts
[4355.88 → 4356.64] of God
[4356.64 → 4358.20] by living lives
[4358.20 → 4359.22] of praise
[4359.22 → 4360.24] to God.
[4362.04 → 4362.72] This quote
[4362.72 → 4363.50] from John Piper
[4363.50 → 4364.72] kind of keeps coming up
[4364.72 → 4365.18] in our church
[4365.18 → 4366.04] in the last couple of weeks,
[4366.14 → 4367.14] but it's so applicable
[4367.14 → 4367.84] to this sermon,
[4367.98 → 4368.48] so applicable
[4368.48 → 4369.20] to this message
[4369.20 → 4369.68] from Jude.
[4370.42 → 4371.42] John Piper says this,
[4371.42 → 4372.98] it says,
[4373.10 → 4374.04] missions is not
[4374.04 → 4374.78] the ultimate goal
[4374.78 → 4375.30] of the church.
[4376.34 → 4377.10] Worship is.
[4378.12 → 4379.16] Missions exist
[4379.16 → 4381.08] because worship doesn't.
[4382.72 → 4383.86] Worship is ultimate,
[4384.66 → 4385.50] not missions
[4385.50 → 4387.04] because God is ultimate,
[4387.70 → 4388.32] not man.
[4389.82 → 4390.96] When this age is over
[4390.96 → 4392.76] and the countless millions
[4392.76 → 4393.56] of the redeemed
[4393.56 → 4394.68] fall on their faces
[4394.68 → 4395.94] before the throne of God,
[4397.00 → 4398.00] missions will be no more.
[4398.00 → 4401.36] It's a temporary necessity,
[4402.18 → 4403.40] but worship
[4403.40 → 4405.34] abides forever.
[4406.70 → 4408.50] So worship is the fuel
[4408.50 → 4409.78] and goal
[4409.78 → 4410.92] of mission.
[4413.02 → 4414.60] Our lives are meant
[4414.60 → 4415.58] to praise him.
[4417.16 → 4418.14] And so that's the question
[4418.14 → 4419.04] for us here today.
[4420.76 → 4423.06] Is our life praising God?
[4424.86 → 4425.84] I'm going to invite
[4425.84 → 4427.10] the praise team up right now.
[4427.10 → 4427.40] Actually,
[4427.42 → 4427.84] they're going to make
[4427.84 → 4428.62] their way to the stage
[4428.62 → 4429.04] right now
[4429.04 → 4429.80] because today,
[4430.18 → 4430.94] like every week,
[4430.98 → 4431.52] we're actually going to
[4431.52 → 4433.10] respond to this message
[4433.10 → 4435.64] in praise to our God.
[4436.50 → 4437.24] And as they make their way
[4437.24 → 4437.82] up front here,
[4437.86 → 4437.98] though,
[4437.98 → 4438.80] I want us to remember
[4438.80 → 4439.94] Jude's doxology.
[4440.08 → 4440.74] Remember the words
[4440.74 → 4441.36] from this text.
[4441.48 → 4442.46] Let these truths
[4442.46 → 4443.42] ring in your heart
[4443.42 → 4444.54] as we respond in praise.
[4444.88 → 4445.72] You are kept.
[4446.32 → 4447.56] You're guarded by Jesus
[4447.56 → 4448.34] and your salvation
[4448.34 → 4448.98] is secure.
[4449.98 → 4451.54] You are not only forgiven,
[4452.42 → 4453.52] but you are righteous
[4453.52 → 4454.82] in the eyes
[4454.82 → 4455.94] of Jesus your Saviour
[4455.94 → 4457.20] and you are viewed
[4457.20 → 4458.68] as blameless
[4458.68 → 4460.04] in the eyes of God.
[4461.00 → 4461.52] And so church,
[4461.62 → 4461.82] brothers,
[4461.96 → 4462.62] sisters in Christ,
[4462.68 → 4463.76] above all know this.
[4465.84 → 4467.08] Salvation belongs
[4467.08 → 4467.96] to our God
[4467.96 → 4469.48] who sits upon the throne.
[4471.04 → 4472.44] So unto the Lamb
[4472.44 → 4473.28] be praise
[4473.28 → 4474.28] and glory,
[4474.74 → 4475.12] wisdom
[4475.12 → 4476.32] and thanks,
[4476.56 → 4476.92] honour
[4476.92 → 4478.12] and power
[4478.12 → 4479.28] and strength
[4479.28 → 4480.70] to our God
[4480.70 → 4481.68] forever and ever.
[4481.78 → 4481.98] Amen?
[4481.98 → 4483.34] Please stand.
[4483.40 → 4483.70] Let's sing.
[4483.70 → 4501.86] Salvation belongs to our God
[4501.86 → 4507.18] Who sits upon the throne
[4507.18 → 4513.82] And come to the throne
[4513.82 → 4519.78] Praise and glory, wisdom and thanks
[4519.78 → 4525.62] With honour and power and strength
[4525.62 → 4531.86] He to our God forever and ever
[4531.86 → 4537.82] He to our God forever and ever
[4537.82 → 4543.78] He to our God forever and ever
[4543.78 → 4544.94] Amen
[4544.94 → 4554.22] And we, our redeemed, shall be strong
[4554.22 → 4560.88] In purpose and unity
[4560.88 → 4566.22] Declaring our love
[4566.86 → 4572.22] Praise and glory, wisdom and thanks
[4572.88 → 4578.22] Honour and power and strength
[4578.22 → 4584.18] He to our God forever and ever
[4584.18 → 4590.18] He to our God forever and ever
[4590.18 → 4596.18] He to our God forever and ever
[4596.18 → 4597.18] Amen
[4597.18 → 4607.14] Be to our God forever and ever
[4607.14 → 4609.14] Amen
[4609.14 → 4614.14] Be to our God forever and ever
[4614.14 → 4620.14] Be to our God forever and ever
[4620.14 → 4621.14] Amen
[4621.14 → 4627.10] Amen
[4627.10 → 4631.10] Be to our God forever and ever
[4631.10 → 4632.10] Amen
[4632.10 → 4637.10] Be to our God forever and ever
[4637.10 → 4643.10] Be to our God forever and ever
[4643.10 → 4644.10] Amen
[4644.10 → 4654.12] And so pray with me
[4654.12 → 4657.78] God, we thank you so much for your son
[4657.78 → 4660.64] Thank you for the gifts that he has given us
[4660.64 → 4662.20] The salvation that we find
[4662.20 → 4663.92] Not just in the cross, God
[4663.92 → 4664.84] But in the empty tomb
[4664.84 → 4666.62] In his life and his death and his resurrection
[4666.62 → 4669.08] And Lord, we are grateful that
[4669.08 → 4671.06] Not only are our sins simply forgiven
[4671.06 → 4673.06] But God, you have made us righteous
[4673.06 → 4675.16] So that we are seen blameless in his sight
[4675.16 → 4677.92] Thank you for that salvation that is assured to us
[4677.92 → 4678.42] Through Jesus
[4678.42 → 4680.06] And as we go from this place
[4680.06 → 4683.12] May we live lives of praise to you
[4683.12 → 4685.16] We pray this in your name
[4685.16 → 4685.58] Amen
[4685.58 → 4688.48] Now receive this parting blessing
[4688.48 → 4690.40] The priestly blessing from number six
[4690.40 → 4693.48] The Lord bless you and keep you
[4693.48 → 4696.14] The Lord make his face shine upon you
[4696.14 → 4697.36] And be gracious to you
[4697.36 → 4699.88] The Lord turn his face toward you
[4699.88 → 4702.00] And give you his peace
[4702.00 → 4703.44] And all God's people said
[4703.44 → 4704.50] Amen
[4704.50 → 4734.48] Thank you.
[4734.50 → 4764.48] Thank you.
[4764.50 → 4766.50] Thank you.
[4794.50 → 4801.50] Praise Him, all creatures here below.
[4803.84 → 4814.32] Praise Him above, ye heavenly hosts.
[4814.32 → 4827.66] Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
[4827.66 → 4833.20] Amen.
