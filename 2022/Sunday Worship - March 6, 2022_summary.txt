• This understanding is evident in the Bible, particularly in Exodus 20 and Acts, where it is clear that Israel's relationship with God began with his gracious actions and choice, not through obedience to the law.
• Similarly, for believers today, the law is an act of responding to God's choice and selection, rather than a means of establishing or maintaining a relationship with him.

• Holding oneself to a high standard of gratitude through following the law is key to avoiding moral crises and keeping people connected to the church
• The ability to hold oneself to a high moral standard is only possible through grace and faith.
