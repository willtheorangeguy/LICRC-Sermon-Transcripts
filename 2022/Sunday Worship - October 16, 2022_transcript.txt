[556.00 --> 558.00]  It's good.
[558.00 --> 559.00]  Good.
[559.00 --> 561.76]  How about there? Sort of.
[565.24 --> 567.94]  I'll keep talking. Courtney, you figured it. Perfect. Good morning.
[569.68 --> 576.28]  Welcome to church. We're really excited that you are here, especially if you are here visiting
[576.28 --> 581.26]  with us this morning. As people are making their way in, there's lots of room up front.
[581.26 --> 590.14]  Come on in. No? No takers? No? Okay. We are really excited to worship with you this morning.
[590.36 --> 596.06]  My name is Chris. I'm one of the pastors here, and this morning it's my privilege to lead you
[596.06 --> 601.98]  along with these others and some who you don't yet see in our shared worship together today.
[602.34 --> 606.58]  If you are visiting with us this morning, we would love to connect with you.
[607.04 --> 611.22]  We can do that a couple ways. Of course, you can just grab me or someone with a name tag,
[611.26 --> 616.28]  after the service, and touch base with them. Or you can grab one of these cards, fill it out,
[616.34 --> 621.38]  and leave it by the church office, or put it in the collection bag. Or there's a QR code you can
[621.38 --> 627.00]  scan, and you can do the form online. We would just love to connect with you and hear your story of life
[627.00 --> 633.46]  and faith and engage you and wonder how we can walk alongside you in whatever it is you're facing
[633.46 --> 638.88]  this morning. There are a number of things that are happening in the life of our church, and so I'm
[638.88 --> 642.76]  going to invite Linda to come to the front. She's going to make an announcement on behalf of the
[642.76 --> 649.92]  Women's Ministry. Why don't you do that now? And as she's making her way up, this is the final week
[649.92 --> 656.04]  for us to receive applications for the Young Adult Coordinator position. And so if you've been around,
[656.12 --> 661.16]  you know that that's happening. Applications close this week on Tuesday, technically. And so if you know
[661.16 --> 667.04]  someone, or if you were planning to apply, please get that application in to us as quick as you can.
[667.54 --> 669.96]  Thank you. Linda, why don't you use that? Oh, you have a microphone. Even better.
[670.74 --> 674.36]  Good morning. My name is Linda Molenkamp, and I'm part of the Women's Ministry team.
[674.90 --> 680.80]  And we are super excited about a women's event coming up. We realize it's been since December 2019
[680.80 --> 688.26]  we've gotten together, so we are so excited to be hosting this event. It is October, Friday, October 28th,
[688.26 --> 695.46]  from 7 to 10 p.m. And Saturday, October 29th, from 9 to 2 p.m. And if you can only come to one of those evenings,
[695.58 --> 701.20]  that's fantastic. We will really welcome you. We have a table at the back, so if you want to come,
[701.64 --> 706.44]  if you have any questions after church, we'll be at the table there, and you can ask us questions about the speaker
[706.44 --> 713.36]  and what's happening that weekend. And we invite all women to please join us. We're just really wanting to get together,
[713.96 --> 718.18]  spend some time together that weekend. There's a notice in the bulletin that has a
[718.18 --> 724.54]  few more details. We have a few requests for volunteers, but if you want to check the bulletin
[724.54 --> 730.40]  for the details, there's phone numbers from all of us ladies. You can reach us, you can text us,
[730.52 --> 736.66]  you can phone us, or email us. So I don't think you should want to text me, because my number's wrong
[736.66 --> 741.78]  in the bulletin. So if you text me, you might be signing up for something different, like square
[741.78 --> 747.40]  dancing or something. So you'd probably rather come to this event. Please talk to us after church,
[747.40 --> 749.48]  and we look forward to seeing you. Thank you.
[753.76 --> 758.44]  Linda reminds me, you do need to RSVP so we know how much food to prepare for you. Thank you.
[758.44 --> 769.90]  As you are able, and where you are, I'm going to invite you to stand. We can be welcomed by God in our
[769.90 --> 770.68]  worship together.
[775.20 --> 783.40]  God speaks his name over us and ushers into this place where two or three are gathered in his name,
[783.40 --> 793.08]  and so receive his greeting. Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus
[793.08 --> 801.54]  Christ, Son and our Savior, through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Let's worship God together.
[801.54 --> 813.30]  In Psalm 145, David calls us to look back on our lives and the generations before us, and reflect on the
[813.30 --> 821.24]  goodness of God. We're encouraged to praise God for his greatness, his compassion, and his faithfulness,
[821.80 --> 829.12]  and to thank him for his promises, promises that we can count on, not only in good times, but also in
[829.12 --> 836.78]  times of trial and sorrow. The Lord is good to all. He has compassion on all that he has made.
[837.20 --> 838.24]  Let's worship together.
[838.24 --> 838.36]  Amen.
[838.36 --> 839.36]  Amen.
[839.36 --> 840.36]  Amen.
[848.36 --> 852.44]  The Lord is gracious and compassionate.
[852.44 --> 874.60]  Slow to anger and rich in love. The Lord is gracious and compassionate. Slow to anger and rich in love.
[874.60 --> 888.60]  And the Lord is good to all. He has compassion on all that he has made.
[888.60 --> 901.60]  As far as peace is from the land, and so far, he's removed your transmissions from us.
[901.60 --> 924.60]  Praise the Lord, O my soul. Praise the Lord.
[924.60 --> 928.66]  Praise the Lord.
[928.66 --> 943.06]  Praise the Lord, all my soul, praise the Lord
[943.06 --> 948.96]  The Lord is gracious and compassionate
[948.96 --> 957.26]  So to anger and rich in love
[957.26 --> 962.56]  The Lord is gracious and compassionate
[962.56 --> 971.36]  So to anger and rich in love
[971.36 --> 977.46]  And the Lord is good to all
[977.46 --> 983.96]  He has compassion for all that He has made
[983.96 --> 991.16]  As far as He is from the West
[991.16 --> 998.56]  And so far He has removed our transgressions from us
[998.56 --> 1005.76]  As far as He is from the West
[1005.76 --> 1011.76]  And so far He has removed our transgressions from us
[1011.76 --> 1020.96]  Praise the Lord, all my soul
[1020.96 --> 1024.96]  Praise the Lord
[1024.96 --> 1034.96]  Praise the Lord, all my soul
[1034.96 --> 1042.16]  Praise the Lord
[1042.16 --> 1050.16]  Praise the Lord, all my soul
[1050.16 --> 1056.16]  Praise the Lord
[1056.16 --> 1063.36]  Praise the Lord
[1063.36 --> 1070.56]  Praise the Lord
[1070.56 --> 1077.76]  Praise the Lord
[1077.76 --> 1092.96]  Praise the Lord
[1092.96 --> 1096.96]  Worthy of every song we could ever sing
[1096.96 --> 1103.96]  Worthy of all the praise we could ever bring
[1103.96 --> 1111.16]  Worthy of every song we could ever bring
[1111.16 --> 1113.16]  We live for you
[1113.16 --> 1125.16]  Jesus, the name above every other name
[1125.16 --> 1130.36]  Jesus, the name above every other name
[1130.36 --> 1135.36]  Jesus, the name above every other name
[1135.36 --> 1138.48]  the great breath we could ever breathe
[1138.48 --> 1141.92]  we live for you
[1141.92 --> 1146.56]  we live for you
[1146.56 --> 1151.84]  holy there is no one like you
[1151.84 --> 1155.36]  there is none beside you
[1155.36 --> 1159.36]  open up my eyes
[1165.36 --> 1169.36]  with your heart and needy
[1169.36 --> 1175.36]  give your love to those around me
[1175.36 --> 1181.36]  Jesus the name above every other name
[1181.36 --> 1189.36]  Jesus the only one who could ever save
[1189.36 --> 1193.36]  worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
[1193.36 --> 1197.36]  we live for you
[1197.36 --> 1201.36]  we live for you
[1201.36 --> 1207.36]  holy there is no one like you
[1207.36 --> 1211.36]  there is none beside you
[1211.36 --> 1215.36]  open up my eyes in wonder
[1215.36 --> 1219.36]  show me who you are
[1219.36 --> 1223.36]  and fill me with your heart
[1223.36 --> 1225.36]  and needy
[1225.36 --> 1229.36]  give love to those around me
[1229.36 --> 1255.36]  olur
[1255.36 --> 1264.62]  I will build my life upon your love
[1264.62 --> 1270.08]  It is a birth foundation
[1270.08 --> 1278.14]  I will put my trust in you alone
[1278.14 --> 1283.76]  And I will not be shaken
[1283.76 --> 1291.66]  I will build my life upon your love
[1291.66 --> 1297.12]  It is a birth foundation
[1297.12 --> 1305.06]  I will put my trust in you alone
[1305.06 --> 1310.48]  And I will not be shaken
[1310.48 --> 1315.98]  Holy, there is no one like you
[1315.98 --> 1319.52]  There is none beside you
[1319.52 --> 1324.62]  Open up my eyes in wonder
[1324.62 --> 1328.44]  And show me who you are
[1328.44 --> 1331.38]  And fill me with your heart
[1331.38 --> 1339.28]  And lead me in your love to those around me
[1339.28 --> 1343.78]  Let's pray together
[1343.78 --> 1348.24]  We love you, Lord
[1348.24 --> 1352.18]  But we confess that we can struggle
[1352.18 --> 1354.96]  With reconciling your ways
[1354.96 --> 1357.04]  With our desires and plans
[1357.04 --> 1362.34]  We confess that we don't always fully place our trust in you
[1362.34 --> 1365.94]  That in times of trial and weakness
[1365.94 --> 1370.06]  We can be short-sighted and impatient in our faith
[1370.06 --> 1373.56]  Help us in our weakness, we pray, Lord
[1373.56 --> 1376.26]  Forgive our times of unbelief
[1376.26 --> 1379.24]  And doubt in your sovereignty over our lives
[1379.24 --> 1385.02]  Lord, may our hearts be filled with the final words of Psalm 13
[1385.02 --> 1388.48]  But I trust in your unfailing love
[1388.48 --> 1391.82]  My heart rejoices in your salvation
[1391.82 --> 1394.94]  I will sing the Lord's praise
[1394.94 --> 1397.12]  For he has been good to me
[1397.12 --> 1427.10]  I cry out for your hand of mercy to heal me
[1427.10 --> 1430.80]  I am free, I am free
[1430.80 --> 1436.06]  I need your love to free me
[1436.06 --> 1439.52]  Oh, Lord, my Lord
[1439.52 --> 1443.90]  My strength and weakness
[1443.90 --> 1448.74]  Have rescued me
[1448.74 --> 1452.08]  Oh, Lord
[1452.08 --> 1454.80]  You are my hope
[1454.80 --> 1460.10]  Your promise never fails
[1460.10 --> 1463.46]  And my desire
[1463.46 --> 1468.96]  Is to follow you forever
[1468.96 --> 1471.76]  For you are good
[1471.76 --> 1473.92]  For you are good
[1473.92 --> 1477.76]  For you are good to me
[1477.76 --> 1480.56]  For you are good
[1480.56 --> 1482.76]  For you are good
[1482.76 --> 1487.26]  For you are good to me
[1487.26 --> 1499.22]  I cry out for your hand of mercy to heal me
[1499.22 --> 1502.52]  I am free
[1502.52 --> 1507.88]  I need your love to free me
[1507.88 --> 1510.06]  Oh, Lord
[1510.06 --> 1511.18]  My God
[1511.18 --> 1515.52]  Do my strength and weakness
[1515.52 --> 1520.30]  And rescue me
[1520.30 --> 1521.30]  Oh, Lord
[1521.30 --> 1525.60]  You are my hope
[1525.60 --> 1527.10]  You are my hope
[1527.10 --> 1533.14]  Your promise never fails me
[1533.14 --> 1534.96]  And my desire
[1534.96 --> 1541.46]  Is to follow you forever
[1541.46 --> 1542.44]  For you are good
[1542.44 --> 1559.32]  For you are good, for you are good, for you are good to me.
[1559.32 --> 1578.58]  For you are good, for you are good, for you are good to me.
[1589.32 --> 1619.30]  For you are good, for you are good, for you are good.
[1620.30 --> 1630.06]  Because you were forsaken, I'm accepted, you were condemned.
[1632.28 --> 1643.02]  I'm alive and builds in your spirit as within me, because you die and rose again.
[1643.02 --> 1647.76]  I'm forgiven
[1647.76 --> 1651.60]  Because you were forsaken
[1651.60 --> 1654.84]  I'm accepted
[1654.84 --> 1658.52]  You were condemned
[1658.52 --> 1662.62]  I'm alive and well
[1662.62 --> 1665.82]  Your spirit is within me
[1665.82 --> 1670.62]  Because you died and rose again
[1670.62 --> 1676.72]  Amazing love
[1676.72 --> 1679.86]  How can it be
[1679.86 --> 1685.98]  That you, my King, would die for me
[1685.98 --> 1690.84]  Amazing love
[1690.84 --> 1693.42]  I know it's true
[1693.42 --> 1699.62]  It's my joy to honor you
[1699.62 --> 1702.62]  In all I do
[1703.30 --> 1706.06]  I honor you
[1706.06 --> 1710.74]  I'm forgiven
[1710.74 --> 1714.62]  Because you were forsaken
[1714.62 --> 1717.96]  I'm accepted
[1717.96 --> 1721.62]  You were condemned
[1721.62 --> 1725.88]  I'm alive and well
[1725.88 --> 1729.06]  Your spirit is within me
[1729.06 --> 1733.74]  Because you died and rose again
[1733.74 --> 1738.94]  Amazing love
[1738.94 --> 1743.38]  How long can it be
[1743.38 --> 1749.38]  That you, my King, would die for me
[1749.38 --> 1753.94]  Amazing love
[1753.94 --> 1756.94]  I know it's true
[1756.94 --> 1757.94]  I know it's true
[1757.94 --> 1762.38]  It's my joy to honor you
[1762.38 --> 1765.94]  In all I do
[1765.94 --> 1769.94]  I honor you
[1769.94 --> 1776.38]  You are my King
[1776.38 --> 1781.62]  You are my King
[1781.62 --> 1784.06]  You are my King
[1784.06 --> 1790.10]  Jesus, you are my King
[1790.10 --> 1803.78]  Jesus, you are my King
[1803.78 --> 1808.22]  Jesus, you are my King
[1808.22 --> 1810.30]  Jesus, you are my King
[1810.30 --> 1812.44]  Jesus, you are my King
[1812.44 --> 1820.18]  Praise and love, I know it's true
[1820.18 --> 1825.94]  It's my joy to honor you
[1825.94 --> 1829.10]  In all I do
[1829.10 --> 1832.64]  I honor you
[1832.64 --> 1836.36]  In all I do
[1836.36 --> 1840.26]  I honor you
[1842.44 --> 1843.58]  I invite you to be seated
[1843.58 --> 1866.70]  Good morning, my name is Yap, I'm a deacon here at Emmanuel
[1866.70 --> 1870.26]  We continue our worship with the giving of our gifts
[1870.26 --> 1875.30]  First to the budget and the special offering will be for Night Shift Ministries
[1875.30 --> 1886.78]  Night Shift is a non-profit organization offering food, clothing, crisis counseling, basic nursing, prayer, and other services to those in need
[1886.78 --> 1892.12]  The outreach happens 365 days a year
[1892.12 --> 1895.62]  They have a volunteer base of over 2,500 people
[1895.62 --> 1898.62]  And your financial support is greatly appreciated
[1898.62 --> 1902.96]  Matthew 25, verse 35 and 36
[1902.96 --> 1905.74]  For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat
[1905.74 --> 1908.44]  I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink
[1908.44 --> 1911.24]  I was a stranger and you invited me in
[1911.24 --> 1913.14]  I needed clothes and you clothed me
[1913.14 --> 1915.74]  I was sick and you looked after me
[1915.74 --> 1918.22]  I was in prison and you came to visit me
[1918.22 --> 1922.42]  Next week's offering will be for Wagner Hills
[1922.42 --> 1923.26]  Thank you
[1923.26 --> 1924.26]  Thank you
[1924.26 --> 1925.26]  Thank you
[1925.26 --> 1926.26]  Thank you
[1926.26 --> 1928.26]  Thank you
[1928.26 --> 1930.26]  Thank you
[1930.26 --> 1943.94]  Thank you
[1943.94 --> 1948.08]  Thank you
[1948.08 --> 1958.68]  In the depths I cry to you, in darkest places I will call.
[1959.48 --> 1967.78]  Inclined your ear to be a new, and here I cry for mercy.
[1967.78 --> 1979.78]  Oh, how could I come before your throne?
[1980.86 --> 1990.18]  Yet full forgiveness meets my name, I stand redeemed by grace alone.
[1990.18 --> 2001.10]  I will wait for you, I will wait for you, on your word I will rely.
[2002.66 --> 2011.82]  I will wait for you, surely wait for you, till my soul is satisfied.
[2020.18 --> 2031.24]  So push your hope in God alone, take courage in His power to stay.
[2032.44 --> 2042.02]  Completely and forever won, by Christ emerging from the grave.
[2042.02 --> 2052.94]  I will wait for you, I will wait for you, on your word I will rely.
[2054.32 --> 2063.56]  I will wait for you, surely wait for you, till my soul satisfies.
[2063.56 --> 2093.54]  I will wait for you, till my soul satisfies.
[2093.56 --> 2107.04]  I will wait for you, I will wait for you, through the storm and through the night.
[2107.58 --> 2116.96]  I will wait for you, surely wait for you, for your love is my delight.
[2117.12 --> 2134.18]  I will wait for you, I will wait for you, I will wait for you, I will wait for you, till my soul satisfies.
[2134.18 --> 2140.42]  Till my soul is satisfied.
[2164.18 --> 2166.32]  Good morning, everyone.
[2166.48 --> 2168.28]  Before we get to Kids Corner this morning,
[2168.44 --> 2170.24]  we had a council meeting this week,
[2170.30 --> 2175.42]  so at this time I just want to give you all a summary of what we were talking about,
[2175.42 --> 2179.84]  what was on the agenda this week, so I will do that this time.
[2181.00 --> 2184.52]  Some of the highlights from this meeting this week on Tuesday
[2184.52 --> 2187.36]  was we reviewed the ministry leader and coordinator list,
[2187.42 --> 2189.88]  so we have a nice list of ministry leaders at this church,
[2189.88 --> 2194.68]  and it was great to see all the people who are involved in all the ministries here
[2194.68 --> 2197.38]  making the programs and stuff happen at this church,
[2197.48 --> 2199.10]  so that was great to be able to review that.
[2201.02 --> 2205.58]  We had a report on the Safe Church training sessions
[2205.58 --> 2208.30]  that have been going on here over the last little bit.
[2208.38 --> 2210.36]  I think there might be one more coming up or no?
[2210.96 --> 2211.32]  Hopefully.
[2211.96 --> 2212.16]  Okay.
[2213.04 --> 2215.30]  We have an updated facility use policy.
[2215.42 --> 2217.26]  We've got a lot of interest in our church right now.
[2217.36 --> 2218.62]  We're renting some facilities here,
[2218.62 --> 2222.78]  so we are working on a policy for rentals.
[2224.94 --> 2226.84]  Spent a considerable time reviewing.
[2226.96 --> 2228.02]  This is budget time of the year,
[2228.06 --> 2230.16]  so we spent a considerable time reviewing the budget
[2230.16 --> 2231.96]  at our council meeting
[2231.96 --> 2235.00]  and preparing it to present to you, to the congregation.
[2236.36 --> 2238.12]  Our pastors gave us some reports.
[2239.72 --> 2241.20]  For your information,
[2241.36 --> 2244.32]  classes is happening this week in Surrey at Fleetwood.
[2245.74 --> 2246.88]  And good news, I guess,
[2246.88 --> 2249.18]  the new chairs have been ordered for the sanctuary,
[2249.38 --> 2251.00]  so they should be coming sometime.
[2252.00 --> 2254.80]  I think Sylvie said it might take 14 weeks or something like that,
[2254.84 --> 2257.04]  so that's on the schedule.
[2257.46 --> 2258.96]  So that's what happens.
[2260.06 --> 2261.72]  All right, I'm taking my council hat off,
[2261.74 --> 2265.38]  and now we're going to do children's worship time activities.
[2265.54 --> 2267.10]  So if all the kids want to come up front
[2267.10 --> 2268.66]  to hear for children's worship time,
[2268.66 --> 2270.40]  that would be great.
[2277.78 --> 2278.80]  Awesome, you're fast.
[2282.02 --> 2283.50]  If you're a visitor here,
[2284.06 --> 2286.42]  I think it's anyone who's eligible
[2286.42 --> 2289.00]  to go to children's worship time up to grade four?
[2290.00 --> 2290.92]  Up to grade four.
[2291.04 --> 2291.30]  All right.
[2292.12 --> 2293.72]  Oh, we got a nice crew of kids here this morning.
[2293.78 --> 2294.68]  This morning, kids,
[2294.98 --> 2295.86]  how's everybody doing?
[2295.86 --> 2298.22]  Can we do that louder?
[2298.78 --> 2299.22]  Yes!
[2299.90 --> 2300.60]  I like that.
[2301.16 --> 2301.98]  All right.
[2303.02 --> 2304.08]  This morning,
[2304.38 --> 2306.50]  we are talking about
[2306.50 --> 2308.88]  Genesis in the Bible,
[2309.28 --> 2313.40]  and God created the earth in six days,
[2313.44 --> 2314.30]  and on the seventh day,
[2314.38 --> 2314.92]  he rested.
[2315.04 --> 2317.12]  So we're going to talk a little bit about rest today.
[2318.44 --> 2319.86]  Now, I used to have,
[2320.02 --> 2320.64]  or I had,
[2320.76 --> 2322.06]  kids that were about your age,
[2322.10 --> 2323.48]  and I remember when they were little,
[2323.48 --> 2325.62]  they often needed a lot of rest.
[2325.68 --> 2326.50]  Do you guys need rest,
[2326.54 --> 2327.28]  or can you guys, like,
[2327.32 --> 2328.82]  stay up pretty late at night and stuff?
[2329.98 --> 2330.46]  Oh, yeah?
[2330.52 --> 2330.88]  You can?
[2331.82 --> 2332.38]  Okay, well,
[2332.48 --> 2333.66]  I did a little bit of research
[2333.66 --> 2334.94]  because I had some good memories
[2334.94 --> 2336.32]  of what my kids were like
[2336.32 --> 2337.66]  when they were a little younger
[2337.66 --> 2338.46]  than maybe you guys,
[2338.52 --> 2339.70]  and they would just be playing
[2339.70 --> 2340.60]  as hard as they could,
[2340.66 --> 2341.72]  and then they would kind of, like,
[2341.78 --> 2342.58]  just pass out
[2342.58 --> 2343.60]  and need a lot of rest.
[2344.18 --> 2345.42]  So can everybody see
[2345.42 --> 2346.96]  the screen up front there?
[2348.90 --> 2349.54]  We're going to roll.
[2349.62 --> 2350.86]  Does any of this look like you?
[2350.94 --> 2351.56]  Have any of you guys
[2351.56 --> 2353.14]  ever been in this kind of position before?
[2353.68 --> 2354.70]  I bet you your parents
[2354.70 --> 2355.40]  would say otherwise.
[2355.60 --> 2356.54]  Okay, the next one.
[2356.70 --> 2357.32]  How about that?
[2357.40 --> 2357.92]  Is that you?
[2359.58 --> 2360.52]  Never done that?
[2361.00 --> 2362.02]  How about the next one?
[2362.66 --> 2363.46]  How about that one?
[2364.28 --> 2365.72]  How about at this time of the year?
[2365.98 --> 2367.28]  There's lots of pumpkins out there.
[2367.34 --> 2368.18]  Nobody's done that?
[2368.94 --> 2369.82]  How about the next one?
[2370.60 --> 2371.68]  How about that?
[2371.94 --> 2372.98]  Going for a walk?
[2374.16 --> 2374.78]  Never did that.
[2374.82 --> 2375.64]  How about the next one?
[2376.16 --> 2376.86]  How about that one?
[2376.86 --> 2376.88]  How about that one?
[2376.88 --> 2380.90]  Nobody's done that?
[2383.12 --> 2384.66]  I think I caught one of my boys
[2384.66 --> 2385.50]  doing that one time.
[2385.60 --> 2386.44]  Okay, next one.
[2386.96 --> 2387.76]  How about that one?
[2387.80 --> 2388.82]  Going shopping with mom.
[2391.06 --> 2392.28]  How about the next one?
[2393.34 --> 2393.98]  How about a...
[2393.98 --> 2394.78]  Have you ever seen a...
[2394.78 --> 2395.54]  What about that line?
[2395.60 --> 2396.82]  Is he taking a nice little nap
[2396.82 --> 2397.60]  there on that log?
[2398.10 --> 2398.46]  Never.
[2398.90 --> 2399.24]  No.
[2399.94 --> 2401.04]  And I think there's one more.
[2401.12 --> 2401.90]  Another pet one.
[2402.32 --> 2403.04]  How about that guy?
[2403.04 --> 2404.56]  He's taking a break there, too.
[2404.56 --> 2407.62]  All right, so today we're going to
[2407.62 --> 2408.78]  talk a bit about rest
[2408.78 --> 2409.78]  and children's worship time,
[2409.86 --> 2410.88]  but before we do that,
[2410.96 --> 2411.90]  we're going to do the blessings,
[2412.06 --> 2413.28]  so can everyone stand up
[2413.28 --> 2414.34]  and face the congregation?
[2419.48 --> 2419.84]  Ready?
[2420.06 --> 2420.56]  The...
[2420.56 --> 2422.56]  The...
[2422.56 --> 2423.56]  The...
[2423.56 --> 2424.56]  The...
[2424.56 --> 2425.56]  The...
[2434.56 --> 2460.30]  Before we open God's Word together,
[2460.30 --> 2461.98]  I'm going to lead us
[2461.98 --> 2463.80]  in our church family prayer.
[2467.98 --> 2468.98]  In this prayer,
[2469.16 --> 2471.40]  we're going to pray for a few things.
[2472.10 --> 2472.90]  First of all,
[2473.48 --> 2474.90]  we are going to pray
[2474.90 --> 2476.82]  for the election
[2476.82 --> 2477.98]  that took place yesterday
[2477.98 --> 2479.14]  and the leaders
[2479.14 --> 2480.96]  who were elected there.
[2482.30 --> 2483.74]  I don't see her this morning,
[2483.88 --> 2484.64]  but Marg Kuntz,
[2484.74 --> 2485.10]  who is...
[2485.10 --> 2485.64]  There you are.
[2485.74 --> 2486.06]  Thank you.
[2486.14 --> 2487.12]  Marg was re-elected,
[2487.12 --> 2488.66]  so congratulations to you.
[2488.66 --> 2488.78]  Thank you.
[2491.98 --> 2495.06]  You can chat with her
[2495.06 --> 2495.84]  after the service.
[2495.92 --> 2497.38]  I'm sure she would appreciate that.
[2498.18 --> 2499.38]  Also, we're going to pray
[2499.38 --> 2500.16]  for some people
[2500.16 --> 2502.96]  who need our intercession
[2502.96 --> 2504.40]  and who are mourning,
[2504.62 --> 2505.60]  and so we're going to pray
[2505.60 --> 2507.20]  with Elsa Hubertz.
[2508.04 --> 2509.30]  Her father, Cornelius,
[2509.38 --> 2509.98]  passed away,
[2510.68 --> 2512.40]  94 years old,
[2512.74 --> 2515.18]  this past Friday,
[2515.18 --> 2516.38]  and so they are
[2516.38 --> 2518.06]  in the midst of mourning
[2518.06 --> 2519.68]  and making plans there,
[2519.68 --> 2520.70]  and so we're going to pray
[2520.70 --> 2522.44]  for the Hubertz family
[2522.44 --> 2523.82]  and the Verkike families
[2523.82 --> 2524.32]  as well,
[2524.66 --> 2525.76]  Case and Anna Marie,
[2525.98 --> 2528.22]  who are nephews to Cornelius.
[2529.02 --> 2531.16]  There's lots of connections there.
[2531.98 --> 2533.52]  We're also going to pray
[2533.52 --> 2536.00]  this morning for John Trass.
[2536.34 --> 2537.70]  John used to be a member here.
[2537.80 --> 2539.72]  He's Ivan, Kim's father,
[2540.76 --> 2541.84]  brother-in-law, right,
[2541.92 --> 2543.40]  Dolores, brother-in-law to you.
[2543.64 --> 2544.24]  Connected here.
[2544.24 --> 2547.26]  He fell into his mechanics pit
[2547.26 --> 2550.18]  and is in the hospital,
[2550.44 --> 2551.56]  has broken ribs
[2551.56 --> 2552.78]  and broken vertebrae
[2552.78 --> 2554.96]  and will need surgery,
[2555.70 --> 2559.94]  and right now is sleeping,
[2560.44 --> 2563.14]  but they're asking for our prayers
[2563.14 --> 2564.10]  and for intercession
[2564.10 --> 2564.80]  on their behalf,
[2564.88 --> 2566.26]  so we're going to pray
[2566.26 --> 2567.92]  for them as well.
[2568.64 --> 2569.68]  There are other things
[2569.68 --> 2570.44]  that will come up
[2570.44 --> 2571.48]  in our prayer
[2571.48 --> 2572.32]  that you can find
[2572.32 --> 2574.16]  also made reference to
[2574.16 --> 2575.26]  in our e-bulletin
[2575.26 --> 2576.40]  that goes out.
[2576.70 --> 2577.46]  Will you join your heart
[2577.46 --> 2578.52]  with me in prayer?
[2584.02 --> 2587.04]  Holy and almighty God,
[2587.68 --> 2588.76]  we gather here
[2588.76 --> 2590.74]  as your bride,
[2591.46 --> 2592.60]  as the church family,
[2593.16 --> 2595.40]  because you are most worthy
[2595.40 --> 2596.42]  to be praised.
[2597.22 --> 2598.38]  We gather here
[2598.38 --> 2600.18]  because you are God alone
[2600.18 --> 2601.66]  and to you alone
[2601.66 --> 2603.40]  may we cry out for help.
[2603.76 --> 2604.78]  To you alone
[2604.78 --> 2606.30]  should we cry out for help
[2606.30 --> 2607.52]  because you alone
[2607.52 --> 2609.02]  are the only one
[2609.02 --> 2611.56]  able to do anything about it.
[2611.62 --> 2612.72]  And so, Lord God,
[2612.80 --> 2614.10]  in your majesty,
[2614.34 --> 2616.22]  in your sovereign power,
[2616.46 --> 2618.26]  hear our prayers
[2618.26 --> 2619.86]  and use them
[2619.86 --> 2622.36]  to guide and to shape history
[2622.36 --> 2624.66]  towards your ends
[2624.66 --> 2625.94]  for your glory
[2625.94 --> 2627.20]  and for the good
[2627.20 --> 2628.18]  of all those
[2628.18 --> 2629.20]  whom you have called.
[2631.04 --> 2631.82]  Father God,
[2631.90 --> 2632.76]  as we gather
[2632.76 --> 2633.86]  in this place,
[2634.06 --> 2634.82]  we know that there
[2634.82 --> 2636.60]  are places
[2636.60 --> 2637.50]  around the world
[2637.50 --> 2638.24]  that are unable
[2638.24 --> 2638.98]  to do so.
[2640.28 --> 2640.96]  There are Christians
[2640.96 --> 2642.56]  who cannot gather
[2642.56 --> 2644.14]  in groups of this size
[2644.14 --> 2645.66]  or in groups at all
[2645.66 --> 2646.98]  for fear of death
[2646.98 --> 2648.00]  or being arrested
[2648.00 --> 2649.46]  because of persecution.
[2650.36 --> 2650.70]  And so,
[2650.80 --> 2651.62]  we pray for them
[2651.62 --> 2653.06]  both for the boldness
[2653.06 --> 2653.92]  of their faith
[2653.92 --> 2655.52]  in still yet gathering
[2655.52 --> 2656.40]  as well,
[2656.54 --> 2656.96]  Lord God,
[2657.02 --> 2658.42]  that you would protect them
[2658.42 --> 2660.06]  and preserve them.
[2662.50 --> 2663.34]  And God,
[2663.48 --> 2665.94]  through their mighty influence,
[2666.82 --> 2668.88]  may they change
[2668.88 --> 2670.16]  the world around them.
[2671.28 --> 2672.68]  May we be inspired
[2672.68 --> 2673.98]  to change the world
[2673.98 --> 2674.88]  around us
[2674.88 --> 2676.48]  even as we gather
[2676.48 --> 2678.04]  here in this place.
[2678.18 --> 2678.72]  We thank you
[2678.72 --> 2679.52]  for the opportunity
[2679.52 --> 2680.40]  to do so
[2680.40 --> 2681.42]  and we thank you
[2681.42 --> 2682.04]  for the brothers
[2682.04 --> 2682.70]  and sisters
[2682.70 --> 2684.28]  with whom we gather.
[2684.28 --> 2685.16]  We thank you
[2685.16 --> 2685.90]  for the questions
[2685.90 --> 2687.46]  that draw us here,
[2687.62 --> 2688.60]  for the praises
[2688.60 --> 2690.18]  that emanate from here,
[2690.28 --> 2691.64]  and as we go
[2691.64 --> 2692.50]  later today,
[2692.64 --> 2693.46]  may we do so
[2693.46 --> 2694.22]  in the power
[2694.22 --> 2695.92]  of your holy name
[2695.92 --> 2696.50]  to reveal
[2696.50 --> 2697.56]  your kingdom come
[2697.56 --> 2698.98]  and your kingdom coming,
[2699.38 --> 2700.28]  that we might be
[2700.28 --> 2700.80]  ambassadors
[2700.80 --> 2701.80]  of reconciliation
[2701.80 --> 2702.78]  and agents
[2702.78 --> 2703.48]  of transformation
[2703.48 --> 2705.34]  in our homes
[2705.34 --> 2706.28]  and our neighborhoods,
[2706.56 --> 2707.36]  our workplaces,
[2707.48 --> 2708.60]  and wherever it is,
[2708.72 --> 2709.08]  Lord God,
[2709.14 --> 2709.82]  that you call us,
[2709.88 --> 2710.28]  whether that is
[2710.28 --> 2711.14]  around the world
[2711.14 --> 2712.80]  or close to home.
[2712.80 --> 2715.74]  Father,
[2715.84 --> 2716.54]  as we look
[2716.54 --> 2718.12]  close to home,
[2718.28 --> 2719.30]  we know that there are
[2719.30 --> 2720.74]  still wildfires
[2720.74 --> 2721.64]  that are persisting
[2721.64 --> 2722.26]  and new fires
[2722.26 --> 2723.08]  that are starting up
[2723.08 --> 2723.50]  and that are,
[2723.80 --> 2724.62]  once again,
[2724.74 --> 2725.70]  we are experiencing
[2725.70 --> 2727.18]  a season of drought.
[2728.50 --> 2729.00]  And so, God,
[2729.06 --> 2732.24]  we praise your name
[2732.24 --> 2733.40]  for the weather
[2733.40 --> 2734.24]  that we have had
[2734.24 --> 2735.14]  and for the blessing
[2735.14 --> 2735.88]  that it has been
[2735.88 --> 2736.72]  into October
[2736.72 --> 2738.80]  to enjoy it as such
[2738.80 --> 2740.68]  and yet we need rain.
[2741.86 --> 2742.48]  Father God,
[2742.48 --> 2743.80]  we have only had
[2743.80 --> 2745.38]  20 millimeters of rain
[2745.38 --> 2746.26]  since July
[2746.26 --> 2747.56]  and we ask
[2747.56 --> 2748.38]  that you would
[2748.38 --> 2750.06]  send rain.
[2752.76 --> 2753.24]  God,
[2753.30 --> 2754.42]  we pray for those
[2754.42 --> 2755.08]  who are affected
[2755.08 --> 2756.54]  by these fires,
[2756.78 --> 2758.06]  both in the damage
[2758.06 --> 2759.26]  of property
[2759.26 --> 2761.28]  and the loss of life,
[2761.36 --> 2763.16]  but also for the quality
[2763.16 --> 2763.82]  of life
[2763.82 --> 2764.38]  and the air,
[2764.56 --> 2765.72]  the impact on air
[2765.72 --> 2766.32]  and the struggle
[2766.32 --> 2767.60]  that some have to breathe
[2767.60 --> 2768.80]  during these times.
[2768.92 --> 2770.70]  We pray that you would
[2770.70 --> 2772.22]  be near to them
[2772.22 --> 2773.36]  and restore them
[2773.36 --> 2774.92]  and protect them
[2774.92 --> 2775.94]  in this season.
[2777.58 --> 2778.32]  As well,
[2778.38 --> 2778.80]  Lord God,
[2778.92 --> 2779.50]  here,
[2779.92 --> 2781.18]  we thank you
[2781.18 --> 2783.46]  for yesterday's election.
[2784.02 --> 2785.00]  We thank you
[2785.00 --> 2785.56]  for the way
[2785.56 --> 2787.30]  that you are at work
[2787.30 --> 2787.94]  among us
[2787.94 --> 2789.20]  through elected officials
[2789.20 --> 2790.24]  and public servants.
[2790.76 --> 2791.46]  We pray,
[2791.72 --> 2791.92]  Lord,
[2792.02 --> 2792.98]  for the humility
[2792.98 --> 2793.92]  of leaders
[2793.92 --> 2795.16]  to serve you
[2795.16 --> 2797.06]  in their office.
[2797.68 --> 2798.10]  God,
[2798.16 --> 2798.56]  even though
[2798.56 --> 2799.66]  not all
[2799.66 --> 2801.00]  acknowledge you
[2801.00 --> 2801.70]  as Lord,
[2801.84 --> 2802.22]  even though
[2802.22 --> 2803.30]  not all who serve
[2803.30 --> 2804.28]  do so
[2804.28 --> 2805.18]  out of the power
[2805.18 --> 2805.78]  of your name
[2805.78 --> 2806.82]  and your Holy Spirit,
[2807.32 --> 2808.26]  we pray that you
[2808.26 --> 2809.48]  would use them
[2809.48 --> 2810.52]  mightily.
[2812.00 --> 2812.66]  And God,
[2812.72 --> 2813.58]  for those who do
[2813.58 --> 2815.68]  serve from that way,
[2815.78 --> 2816.30]  for those who
[2816.30 --> 2818.10]  walk into this position
[2818.10 --> 2819.70]  holding up Jesus Christ
[2819.70 --> 2820.42]  as the example
[2820.42 --> 2821.24]  of what it means
[2821.24 --> 2821.78]  to serve
[2821.78 --> 2822.46]  and to lead,
[2823.04 --> 2823.74]  we pray that you
[2823.74 --> 2824.82]  would embolden them
[2824.82 --> 2825.66]  in their faith,
[2825.80 --> 2827.02]  that you would protect them
[2827.02 --> 2827.90]  in their commitments,
[2828.18 --> 2828.84]  and we pray,
[2828.98 --> 2829.30]  Lord God,
[2829.36 --> 2830.78]  that you would inspire them
[2830.78 --> 2832.28]  to serve well.
[2834.28 --> 2834.74]  God,
[2834.82 --> 2835.26]  for Marg
[2835.26 --> 2835.82]  and the service
[2835.82 --> 2837.06]  that she is entering into,
[2837.20 --> 2839.08]  we pray your hand upon her.
[2839.80 --> 2840.30]  Bless her
[2840.30 --> 2841.06]  and keep her.
[2841.18 --> 2841.86]  Make your face
[2841.86 --> 2842.82]  to shine upon her.
[2843.22 --> 2844.32]  Be gracious to her.
[2845.12 --> 2846.12]  Turn your face
[2846.12 --> 2846.68]  toward her
[2846.68 --> 2847.50]  in this task
[2847.50 --> 2849.40]  and give her peace.
[2851.72 --> 2852.38]  Father God,
[2852.44 --> 2853.60]  we pray much the same
[2853.60 --> 2855.42]  for the new mayor
[2855.42 --> 2856.72]  of Langley Township,
[2856.82 --> 2857.24]  for Eric,
[2857.34 --> 2858.00]  and the new mayor
[2858.00 --> 2858.86]  of Langley City,
[2859.00 --> 2859.46]  for Nathan.
[2859.92 --> 2860.90]  We ask God
[2860.90 --> 2861.58]  that you would
[2861.58 --> 2863.14]  work in them
[2863.14 --> 2863.74]  and through them
[2863.74 --> 2864.46]  and may they
[2864.46 --> 2866.30]  experience blessing
[2866.30 --> 2867.26]  and may we
[2867.26 --> 2868.10]  by them
[2868.10 --> 2869.36]  be blessed.
[2872.54 --> 2873.28]  Father God,
[2873.34 --> 2875.38]  we celebrate
[2875.38 --> 2876.88]  today
[2876.88 --> 2877.56]  with the
[2877.56 --> 2878.70]  Agile family
[2878.70 --> 2879.66]  and the
[2879.66 --> 2880.22]  citizenship,
[2880.40 --> 2881.28]  the Canadian citizenship
[2881.28 --> 2882.52]  that they have received.
[2882.52 --> 2884.02]  we praise God,
[2884.42 --> 2885.42]  we praise you God
[2885.42 --> 2886.12]  for this
[2886.12 --> 2888.28]  opportunity to celebrate
[2888.28 --> 2889.12]  with them
[2889.12 --> 2889.88]  for the journey
[2889.88 --> 2890.98]  that we have been on
[2890.98 --> 2891.56]  with them
[2891.56 --> 2893.00]  from refugees
[2893.00 --> 2894.42]  now to citizens
[2894.42 --> 2895.94]  and to brothers
[2895.94 --> 2896.70]  and sisters.
[2897.38 --> 2897.78]  We pray,
[2897.92 --> 2898.26]  Lord God,
[2898.30 --> 2898.74]  that you would
[2898.74 --> 2900.42]  continue to
[2900.42 --> 2901.54]  hold them
[2901.54 --> 2902.38]  and uphold them
[2902.38 --> 2903.82]  and as
[2903.82 --> 2905.24]  Talal waits
[2905.24 --> 2906.24]  for his
[2906.24 --> 2906.88]  citizenship
[2906.88 --> 2907.48]  paperwork,
[2908.12 --> 2909.12]  we pray that you would
[2909.12 --> 2910.40]  expedite that process
[2910.40 --> 2911.18]  so he can
[2911.18 --> 2913.30]  join in
[2913.30 --> 2914.42]  this celebration
[2914.42 --> 2915.10]  with the rest
[2915.10 --> 2916.14]  of his family
[2916.14 --> 2917.08]  as well.
[2919.08 --> 2919.92]  Lord our God,
[2920.00 --> 2920.86]  we pray for
[2920.86 --> 2922.40]  intercession
[2922.40 --> 2923.32]  in the lives
[2923.32 --> 2923.94]  of those
[2923.94 --> 2925.00]  who are mourning.
[2926.14 --> 2926.94]  We think of
[2926.94 --> 2928.18]  Cornelius' family,
[2929.14 --> 2929.90]  we think of the
[2929.90 --> 2930.26]  Hubert's
[2930.26 --> 2930.44]  and the
[2930.44 --> 2930.88]  Kikes,
[2931.12 --> 2932.04]  Case and Marie
[2932.04 --> 2932.78]  and ask,
[2932.92 --> 2933.32]  Lord God,
[2933.40 --> 2934.64]  that you would
[2934.64 --> 2935.68]  draw near to them
[2935.68 --> 2936.60]  in these days.
[2936.60 --> 2938.36]  we ask,
[2938.46 --> 2938.80]  Lord God,
[2938.86 --> 2940.36]  that there would
[2940.36 --> 2941.14]  be throughout
[2941.14 --> 2942.28]  this time of
[2942.28 --> 2943.50]  grief a testimony
[2943.50 --> 2945.16]  of your nearness.
[2946.80 --> 2948.20]  And as plans
[2948.20 --> 2948.80]  are made
[2948.80 --> 2949.48]  and as families
[2949.48 --> 2950.10]  come together
[2950.10 --> 2951.00]  to make decisions,
[2951.56 --> 2951.90]  Lord God,
[2951.96 --> 2952.92]  we pray for peace
[2952.92 --> 2954.16]  in that process.
[2955.78 --> 2956.86]  Draw near to all
[2956.86 --> 2957.70]  that they might
[2957.70 --> 2958.82]  receive from you
[2958.82 --> 2960.08]  what they need.
[2962.28 --> 2962.80]  Father,
[2962.92 --> 2963.44]  as we
[2963.44 --> 2964.98]  mourn this
[2964.98 --> 2965.84]  loss with them,
[2965.84 --> 2966.54]  we are mindful
[2966.54 --> 2967.38]  of all those
[2967.38 --> 2968.60]  who continue
[2968.60 --> 2969.30]  in mourning.
[2970.12 --> 2970.74]  We are mindful
[2970.74 --> 2973.04]  of anniversaries
[2973.04 --> 2974.30]  of deaths
[2974.30 --> 2975.00]  that are
[2975.00 --> 2976.00]  upcoming.
[2977.12 --> 2977.64]  And we pray,
[2977.78 --> 2978.14]  Lord God,
[2978.20 --> 2979.12]  that in these days
[2979.12 --> 2979.70]  and weeks,
[2980.18 --> 2981.50]  even as our grief
[2981.50 --> 2982.44]  persists,
[2982.70 --> 2983.48]  we would know
[2983.48 --> 2984.76]  your nearness.
[2985.42 --> 2985.92]  We would know
[2985.92 --> 2986.54]  your presence.
[2989.38 --> 2990.70]  Speak words
[2990.70 --> 2991.30]  of hope
[2991.30 --> 2992.40]  and comfort
[2992.40 --> 2994.34]  to our souls
[2994.34 --> 2995.70]  as we walk
[2995.70 --> 2996.48]  through the valley
[2996.48 --> 2997.14]  of the shadow
[2997.14 --> 2997.58]  of death.
[2999.30 --> 3000.06]  Lord our God,
[3000.12 --> 3001.06]  we pray also
[3001.06 --> 3002.50]  for John Trass,
[3003.30 --> 3004.08]  asking that you
[3004.08 --> 3005.34]  would heal him,
[3006.14 --> 3006.74]  asking that you
[3006.74 --> 3008.22]  would protect him
[3008.22 --> 3009.08]  and restore him,
[3009.14 --> 3009.62]  whether it is
[3009.62 --> 3010.88]  through the hands
[3010.88 --> 3011.76]  of the surgeons,
[3011.98 --> 3012.46]  the doctors,
[3012.60 --> 3013.58]  and the hospital staff
[3013.58 --> 3014.94]  who will provide
[3014.94 --> 3015.38]  for him,
[3015.42 --> 3016.64]  or through miraculous
[3016.64 --> 3017.16]  means,
[3017.28 --> 3017.64]  we pray,
[3017.78 --> 3018.20]  Lord God,
[3018.30 --> 3020.10]  hold him in your care
[3020.10 --> 3021.26]  and may he know
[3021.26 --> 3023.02]  your healing hand
[3023.02 --> 3023.70]  upon him.
[3025.02 --> 3026.82]  We pray for the family
[3026.82 --> 3027.68]  and extended family
[3027.68 --> 3028.20]  and friends
[3028.20 --> 3029.10]  who will support
[3029.10 --> 3030.08]  during this time.
[3030.22 --> 3030.78]  May they too
[3030.78 --> 3032.44]  know and see you
[3032.44 --> 3033.96]  at work in the world,
[3034.10 --> 3035.42]  in and through them,
[3035.84 --> 3036.92]  as they serve John
[3036.92 --> 3037.48]  in prayer
[3037.48 --> 3039.20]  and in ministry.
[3041.80 --> 3042.62]  Holy God,
[3042.62 --> 3045.96]  we have a number
[3045.96 --> 3047.64]  of members
[3047.64 --> 3049.34]  and family
[3049.34 --> 3051.18]  who are stepping
[3051.18 --> 3053.14]  into intentional areas
[3053.14 --> 3053.76]  of mission
[3053.76 --> 3054.78]  and ministry
[3054.78 --> 3055.36]  for you.
[3055.90 --> 3056.74]  We think of Jared
[3056.74 --> 3057.70]  with Cape and Ray
[3057.70 --> 3058.62]  in Costa Rica.
[3058.80 --> 3059.94]  We think of Cameron
[3059.94 --> 3061.60]  who will be with
[3061.60 --> 3062.44]  Athletes in Action
[3062.44 --> 3063.62]  going to
[3063.62 --> 3065.96]  Mauritius
[3065.96 --> 3067.48]  and we pray,
[3067.70 --> 3068.04]  Lord God,
[3068.10 --> 3068.72]  that you would
[3068.72 --> 3070.26]  be near to them
[3070.26 --> 3071.46]  and bless them
[3071.46 --> 3072.60]  in those efforts.
[3073.52 --> 3074.16]  We think too
[3074.16 --> 3075.80]  of Jody
[3075.80 --> 3076.38]  and Uriel
[3076.38 --> 3077.22]  and everyone
[3077.22 --> 3079.38]  in Tijuana
[3079.38 --> 3080.48]  and Rosarito
[3080.48 --> 3081.28]  whom we know
[3081.28 --> 3081.90]  and serve
[3081.90 --> 3082.84]  and connect with
[3082.84 --> 3083.64]  there.
[3084.20 --> 3085.42]  We pray as well,
[3085.54 --> 3085.94]  Lord God,
[3086.04 --> 3087.94]  as Brandon
[3087.94 --> 3088.80]  and Aaron,
[3089.02 --> 3089.56]  Pastor Kevin
[3089.56 --> 3090.06]  and myself
[3090.06 --> 3090.72]  have a chance
[3090.72 --> 3091.38]  in a little while
[3091.38 --> 3092.36]  to head to Mexico
[3092.36 --> 3095.06]  and to get engaged
[3095.06 --> 3095.96]  in those connections
[3095.96 --> 3096.74]  and connect with
[3096.74 --> 3097.14]  the leaders
[3097.14 --> 3097.84]  and the ministries
[3097.84 --> 3098.08]  there,
[3098.18 --> 3099.16]  that that relationship
[3099.16 --> 3100.86]  would be bolstered
[3100.86 --> 3101.54]  and we would
[3101.54 --> 3103.16]  foster that
[3103.16 --> 3103.96]  for the service
[3103.96 --> 3104.64]  of your kingdom
[3104.64 --> 3106.12]  and the proclaiming
[3106.12 --> 3106.74]  of your gospel.
[3107.26 --> 3107.84]  We thank you
[3107.84 --> 3109.38]  for that unique privilege
[3109.38 --> 3111.36]  as we serve you
[3111.36 --> 3112.12]  in this way.
[3113.48 --> 3113.80]  God,
[3113.92 --> 3114.98]  we know and trust
[3114.98 --> 3115.70]  that there are
[3115.70 --> 3116.42]  many others
[3116.42 --> 3117.44]  whom you are calling
[3117.44 --> 3118.88]  to serve as missionaries
[3118.88 --> 3119.46]  in the world
[3119.46 --> 3120.36]  and so if they are
[3120.36 --> 3121.60]  among us this morning,
[3121.70 --> 3122.86]  may they hear that call
[3122.86 --> 3123.76]  clearly
[3123.76 --> 3125.24]  and may we,
[3125.44 --> 3126.26]  as a church family,
[3126.42 --> 3127.30]  surround them
[3127.30 --> 3128.60]  in love
[3128.60 --> 3129.60]  and support.
[3131.82 --> 3132.38]  Finally,
[3132.62 --> 3132.90]  Father,
[3133.04 --> 3134.36]  we know that
[3134.36 --> 3136.96]  there are
[3136.96 --> 3137.98]  a number of us
[3137.98 --> 3139.16]  this morning
[3139.16 --> 3142.24]  who are not here
[3142.24 --> 3143.74]  because of sickness,
[3144.02 --> 3144.58]  because of
[3144.58 --> 3146.08]  some sorts of illness
[3146.08 --> 3147.04]  or treatments
[3147.04 --> 3148.94]  or ongoing struggles,
[3149.04 --> 3149.72]  whether it's flu
[3149.72 --> 3150.36]  or COVID
[3150.36 --> 3151.76]  or other health concerns.
[3152.18 --> 3152.66]  We pray,
[3152.78 --> 3152.98]  God,
[3153.04 --> 3154.66]  just for a general healing
[3154.66 --> 3155.82]  of all those
[3155.82 --> 3157.74]  who need you now.
[3157.74 --> 3159.00]  we pray for
[3159.00 --> 3161.00]  the health
[3161.00 --> 3162.92]  of our church family,
[3163.82 --> 3164.50]  trusting that you
[3164.50 --> 3165.36]  hear our prayer
[3165.36 --> 3166.36]  and that you will act
[3166.36 --> 3167.56]  according to your goodwill.
[3168.52 --> 3168.92]  And God,
[3168.98 --> 3169.52]  when it is
[3169.52 --> 3170.38]  that your goodwill
[3170.38 --> 3171.26]  does not match
[3171.26 --> 3172.10]  our ideas
[3172.10 --> 3173.32]  of what it should be,
[3173.62 --> 3175.22]  we pray for humbled hearts
[3175.22 --> 3176.32]  to trust
[3176.32 --> 3177.68]  in you.
[3178.68 --> 3179.94]  So we put our hope
[3179.94 --> 3180.82]  in you.
[3181.32 --> 3183.24]  We trust in your salvation
[3183.24 --> 3184.92]  and we sing
[3184.92 --> 3185.68]  your praises.
[3185.68 --> 3187.34]  in Jesus Christ
[3187.34 --> 3187.96]  we pray.
[3188.78 --> 3189.18]  Amen.
[3189.18 --> 3201.56]  We're going to
[3201.56 --> 3203.34]  open together
[3203.34 --> 3204.50]  and spend some time
[3204.50 --> 3207.08]  in God's word.
[3207.24 --> 3207.94]  We're going to read
[3207.94 --> 3208.60]  this morning
[3208.60 --> 3210.32]  from Psalm 13.
[3211.42 --> 3213.00]  We are in our
[3213.00 --> 3216.34]  series on the Psalms
[3216.34 --> 3217.04]  called Faith
[3217.04 --> 3218.62]  and All Our Feelings
[3218.62 --> 3219.72]  and we're looking
[3219.72 --> 3220.34]  at different
[3220.34 --> 3221.82]  emotional experiences
[3221.82 --> 3222.72]  and realities,
[3222.90 --> 3223.64]  holding them up
[3223.64 --> 3225.12]  to the word of God
[3225.12 --> 3225.88]  and then asking
[3225.88 --> 3227.30]  how we might be
[3227.30 --> 3228.32]  encouraged
[3228.32 --> 3230.62]  both to hold out
[3230.62 --> 3231.70]  those emotions
[3231.70 --> 3232.94]  to understand them
[3232.94 --> 3233.64]  and then also
[3233.64 --> 3235.16]  to be transformed
[3235.16 --> 3235.96]  by the power
[3235.96 --> 3236.58]  of the gospel
[3236.58 --> 3237.60]  in that.
[3237.96 --> 3238.38]  So we're going
[3238.38 --> 3239.32]  to read Psalm 13.
[3239.46 --> 3239.92]  We're going to read
[3239.92 --> 3240.72]  the whole psalm
[3240.72 --> 3241.76]  and then I'm going
[3241.76 --> 3242.46]  to refer back
[3242.46 --> 3243.30]  variously throughout.
[3243.44 --> 3244.28]  So if you have a Bible
[3244.28 --> 3245.34]  I encourage you
[3245.34 --> 3246.12]  to have that
[3246.12 --> 3246.76]  in front of you
[3246.76 --> 3247.44]  as we go.
[3247.44 --> 3261.94]  Psalm 13.
[3263.64 --> 3265.08]  How long, Lord?
[3265.80 --> 3266.88]  Will you forget me
[3266.88 --> 3267.20]  forever?
[3268.14 --> 3269.08]  How long
[3269.08 --> 3269.76]  will you hide
[3269.76 --> 3270.40]  your face
[3270.40 --> 3271.02]  from me?
[3271.64 --> 3272.28]  How long
[3272.28 --> 3273.04]  must I wrestle
[3273.04 --> 3274.00]  with my thoughts
[3274.00 --> 3275.32]  and day after day
[3275.32 --> 3276.04]  have sorrow
[3276.04 --> 3277.30]  in my heart?
[3277.72 --> 3278.70]  How long
[3278.70 --> 3279.72]  will my enemy
[3279.72 --> 3281.82]  triumph over me?
[3283.04 --> 3283.96]  Look on me
[3283.96 --> 3284.88]  and answer,
[3285.34 --> 3285.80]  O God.
[3286.84 --> 3287.64]  Give light
[3287.64 --> 3288.36]  to my eyes
[3288.36 --> 3289.34]  or I will sleep
[3289.34 --> 3290.50]  in death.
[3291.10 --> 3291.80]  And my enemy
[3291.80 --> 3292.26]  will say,
[3292.40 --> 3293.78]  I have overcome him
[3293.78 --> 3295.22]  and my foes
[3295.22 --> 3296.18]  will rejoice
[3296.18 --> 3297.10]  when I fall.
[3298.68 --> 3299.88]  But I trust
[3299.88 --> 3301.78]  in your unfailing love.
[3301.78 --> 3303.52]  my heart
[3303.52 --> 3304.18]  rejoices
[3304.18 --> 3305.38]  in your salvation.
[3306.74 --> 3307.88]  I will sing
[3307.88 --> 3308.90]  the Lord's praise
[3308.90 --> 3309.80]  for he
[3309.80 --> 3310.88]  has been good
[3310.88 --> 3311.42]  to me.
[3312.30 --> 3313.10]  This is the word
[3313.10 --> 3313.54]  of the Lord.
[3313.54 --> 3322.02]  This week,
[3322.20 --> 3322.44]  I,
[3322.86 --> 3323.80]  in preparation
[3323.80 --> 3324.44]  for this,
[3324.72 --> 3325.92]  read an essay
[3325.92 --> 3327.36]  by Anna
[3327.36 --> 3328.06]  Shane
[3328.06 --> 3329.02]  Stardick.
[3331.02 --> 3332.04]  Anna's essay
[3332.04 --> 3333.04]  was called
[3333.04 --> 3334.46]  If God
[3334.46 --> 3335.38]  is alive,
[3336.18 --> 3336.76]  I hate
[3336.76 --> 3337.08]  him.
[3339.08 --> 3339.80]  Now,
[3339.86 --> 3340.08]  Anna
[3340.08 --> 3340.94]  was diagnosed
[3340.94 --> 3342.40]  with bipolar
[3342.40 --> 3343.22]  one disorder
[3343.22 --> 3344.96]  in her 20s.
[3346.30 --> 3347.30]  And she writes,
[3348.26 --> 3350.12]  I found myself
[3350.12 --> 3351.08]  lying in a hospital
[3351.08 --> 3352.40]  bed on suicide
[3352.40 --> 3352.94]  watch.
[3353.58 --> 3354.40]  There was no
[3354.40 --> 3355.58]  meaning in my pain.
[3355.70 --> 3356.42]  There couldn't be.
[3357.04 --> 3358.12]  I couldn't pair it
[3358.12 --> 3358.68]  with the Christian
[3358.68 --> 3359.48]  answers anymore.
[3359.98 --> 3360.88]  All I could think
[3360.88 --> 3361.88]  was God is dead,
[3362.02 --> 3362.68]  God is dead,
[3362.80 --> 3363.50]  God is dead.
[3363.66 --> 3364.48]  And what I meant
[3364.48 --> 3364.98]  was,
[3365.62 --> 3366.64]  if God is alive,
[3367.32 --> 3367.94]  I hate him.
[3369.26 --> 3370.14]  She goes on
[3370.14 --> 3370.50]  to say,
[3371.26 --> 3372.02]  I wallowed
[3372.02 --> 3372.64]  in my
[3372.64 --> 3373.80]  purposelessness,
[3374.32 --> 3374.96]  comfortable
[3374.96 --> 3376.78]  only in my
[3376.78 --> 3377.32]  anger
[3377.32 --> 3378.76]  at God.
[3381.18 --> 3381.52]  Anna,
[3381.66 --> 3382.34]  in that essay,
[3383.14 --> 3383.92]  also writes
[3383.92 --> 3385.36]  that the wrestling
[3385.36 --> 3386.42]  I've done
[3386.42 --> 3387.36]  isn't always
[3387.36 --> 3388.06]  welcome
[3388.06 --> 3389.24]  in Christian
[3389.24 --> 3390.24]  circles.
[3391.50 --> 3392.02]  Now,
[3392.06 --> 3392.44]  I get
[3392.44 --> 3393.12]  that that's
[3393.12 --> 3394.16]  her perspective,
[3394.44 --> 3395.26]  and it's probably
[3395.26 --> 3395.96]  true that
[3395.96 --> 3396.96]  had she talked
[3396.96 --> 3397.58]  to a good
[3397.58 --> 3398.10]  pastor
[3398.10 --> 3398.90]  or a good
[3398.90 --> 3399.60]  Christian friend,
[3399.60 --> 3400.06]  she might
[3400.06 --> 3400.80]  be surprised.
[3401.88 --> 3402.56]  But I also
[3402.56 --> 3403.14]  know that
[3403.14 --> 3403.66]  when it comes
[3403.66 --> 3404.46]  to our own
[3404.46 --> 3405.08]  experience
[3405.08 --> 3406.18]  of emotions,
[3406.70 --> 3407.70]  our inner
[3407.70 --> 3408.36]  perceptions
[3408.36 --> 3409.12]  have the
[3409.12 --> 3409.64]  tendency
[3409.64 --> 3410.94]  to define
[3410.94 --> 3411.62]  what's real.
[3412.74 --> 3412.86]  Right?
[3412.96 --> 3413.54]  So the point
[3413.54 --> 3414.16]  being there
[3414.16 --> 3414.98]  that she
[3414.98 --> 3416.04]  experienced
[3416.04 --> 3416.86]  her community
[3416.86 --> 3417.94]  as unwelcoming
[3417.94 --> 3418.68]  of the sorts
[3418.68 --> 3419.30]  of wrestling
[3419.30 --> 3419.90]  that she
[3419.90 --> 3420.88]  needed to do,
[3421.16 --> 3421.62]  and so that
[3421.62 --> 3422.64]  means for her,
[3422.98 --> 3423.64]  her community
[3423.64 --> 3425.16]  was unwelcoming
[3425.16 --> 3425.86]  of the sorts
[3425.86 --> 3426.38]  of struggles
[3426.38 --> 3427.16]  and questions
[3427.16 --> 3427.88]  and cries
[3427.88 --> 3428.54]  that she
[3428.54 --> 3428.84]  had.
[3430.42 --> 3430.60]  Now,
[3430.64 --> 3430.90]  in this
[3430.90 --> 3431.30]  series,
[3431.62 --> 3431.98]  and we've
[3431.98 --> 3432.42]  said this
[3432.42 --> 3433.06]  so many
[3433.06 --> 3433.50]  times,
[3433.60 --> 3433.92]  but I say
[3433.92 --> 3434.22]  it again
[3434.22 --> 3434.76]  because it's
[3434.76 --> 3435.30]  critical,
[3435.56 --> 3436.08]  I hope
[3436.08 --> 3436.70]  that's not
[3436.70 --> 3437.24]  us.
[3438.24 --> 3438.76]  And I hope
[3438.76 --> 3439.12]  that's not
[3439.12 --> 3440.00]  your experience
[3440.00 --> 3440.92]  of this
[3440.92 --> 3441.72]  church family.
[3441.84 --> 3441.94]  Right?
[3441.96 --> 3442.36]  I hope
[3442.36 --> 3442.64]  that we
[3442.64 --> 3443.06]  can keep
[3443.06 --> 3443.60]  going
[3443.60 --> 3444.40]  in our
[3444.40 --> 3444.92]  ability
[3444.92 --> 3445.52]  to be
[3445.52 --> 3446.08]  a place
[3446.08 --> 3446.42]  that is
[3446.42 --> 3446.74]  safe
[3446.74 --> 3447.64]  for vulnerable
[3447.64 --> 3448.14]  people
[3448.14 --> 3448.54]  and for
[3448.54 --> 3448.86]  hurting
[3448.86 --> 3449.44]  people
[3449.44 --> 3449.84]  and for
[3449.84 --> 3450.30]  questions
[3450.30 --> 3450.76]  and for
[3450.76 --> 3451.10]  doubt
[3451.10 --> 3451.74]  and for
[3451.74 --> 3452.16]  anger.
[3453.10 --> 3453.32]  And that's
[3453.32 --> 3453.52]  one of the
[3453.52 --> 3453.82]  reasons why
[3453.82 --> 3454.14]  I'm so
[3454.14 --> 3455.00]  grateful for
[3455.00 --> 3455.58]  the Women's
[3455.58 --> 3455.92]  Fellowship
[3455.92 --> 3456.52]  for organizing
[3456.52 --> 3458.14]  this processing
[3458.14 --> 3459.12]  grief event
[3459.12 --> 3459.98]  because this
[3459.98 --> 3460.56]  needs to be
[3460.56 --> 3461.04]  the place
[3461.04 --> 3461.48]  where we can
[3461.48 --> 3462.40]  enter into
[3462.40 --> 3463.24]  the pain
[3463.24 --> 3464.08]  of others.
[3465.10 --> 3465.78]  And as we
[3465.78 --> 3466.80]  celebrate together,
[3466.94 --> 3467.42]  as we share
[3467.42 --> 3467.82]  joys,
[3467.92 --> 3468.36]  as we share
[3468.36 --> 3468.82]  encouragement,
[3468.94 --> 3469.34]  as we share
[3469.34 --> 3469.62]  hope,
[3469.88 --> 3470.68]  I pray that we
[3470.68 --> 3471.40]  can also
[3471.40 --> 3472.78]  share pain
[3472.78 --> 3474.18]  and heartache
[3474.18 --> 3475.12]  and sorrow.
[3475.94 --> 3476.38]  And that's
[3476.38 --> 3476.78]  been my
[3476.78 --> 3477.68]  experience of
[3477.68 --> 3478.30]  you all
[3478.30 --> 3479.26]  in my time
[3479.26 --> 3479.52]  here.
[3479.62 --> 3480.04]  I hope
[3480.04 --> 3481.32]  that's yours
[3481.32 --> 3481.86]  as well.
[3483.82 --> 3484.14]  Now,
[3484.14 --> 3484.56]  what I hope
[3484.56 --> 3484.84]  that we
[3484.84 --> 3485.24]  will see
[3485.24 --> 3485.94]  today from
[3485.94 --> 3486.78]  Psalm 13
[3486.78 --> 3488.48]  is that
[3488.48 --> 3490.02]  being angry
[3490.02 --> 3490.98]  at God
[3490.98 --> 3492.02]  is still
[3492.02 --> 3492.76]  an act
[3492.76 --> 3493.38]  of faith.
[3494.90 --> 3495.68]  But it's
[3495.68 --> 3496.40]  important to
[3496.40 --> 3496.84]  whom
[3496.84 --> 3498.80]  and how
[3498.80 --> 3500.02]  we express
[3500.02 --> 3500.56]  that anger.
[3502.40 --> 3502.54]  So,
[3502.60 --> 3503.30]  Psalm 13
[3503.30 --> 3504.14]  teaches us
[3504.14 --> 3504.76]  how to
[3504.76 --> 3505.74]  express our
[3505.74 --> 3506.22]  anger,
[3506.38 --> 3507.36]  even anger
[3507.36 --> 3508.74]  towards God,
[3508.86 --> 3509.66]  and it teaches
[3509.66 --> 3510.46]  us what to do
[3510.46 --> 3510.82]  with those
[3510.82 --> 3511.24]  feelings.
[3512.66 --> 3512.80]  Now,
[3512.86 --> 3513.32]  notice,
[3513.32 --> 3513.90]  if you have
[3513.90 --> 3514.26]  that in
[3514.26 --> 3514.58]  front of
[3514.58 --> 3514.80]  you,
[3515.14 --> 3516.58]  the four-fold
[3516.58 --> 3517.16]  repetition
[3517.16 --> 3517.94]  of the
[3517.94 --> 3518.44]  question,
[3518.84 --> 3519.48]  how long,
[3519.54 --> 3519.88]  in the
[3519.88 --> 3520.86]  first two
[3520.86 --> 3521.18]  verses.
[3522.34 --> 3522.98]  Actually,
[3523.24 --> 3524.06]  this is the
[3524.06 --> 3525.60]  longest string
[3525.60 --> 3526.50]  of consecutive
[3526.50 --> 3527.48]  questions of
[3527.48 --> 3528.60]  God in the
[3528.60 --> 3528.94]  Psalter.
[3530.22 --> 3530.44]  So,
[3530.50 --> 3530.98]  it's a short
[3530.98 --> 3531.48]  psalm,
[3531.68 --> 3532.02]  yes,
[3532.80 --> 3533.26]  but there's
[3533.26 --> 3534.30]  a ton of
[3534.30 --> 3535.44]  emotion packed
[3535.44 --> 3535.92]  into these
[3535.92 --> 3536.52]  short verses.
[3537.52 --> 3538.44]  How long
[3538.44 --> 3538.80]  will you
[3538.80 --> 3539.44]  forget me?
[3540.20 --> 3541.18]  How long
[3541.18 --> 3541.80]  will you hide
[3541.80 --> 3542.30]  your face
[3542.30 --> 3542.84]  from me?
[3542.98 --> 3543.76]  How long
[3543.76 --> 3544.22]  must I
[3544.22 --> 3545.16]  wrestle with
[3545.16 --> 3545.74]  these thoughts?
[3546.00 --> 3546.76]  How long
[3546.76 --> 3547.24]  will my
[3547.24 --> 3547.72]  enemy
[3547.72 --> 3548.52]  triumph
[3548.52 --> 3549.66]  over me?
[3552.06 --> 3552.58]  Now,
[3552.60 --> 3553.02]  there's something
[3553.02 --> 3555.00]  really neat
[3555.00 --> 3556.28]  that's happening
[3556.28 --> 3557.92]  in this text
[3557.92 --> 3558.74]  that you can't
[3558.74 --> 3559.64]  fully understand
[3559.64 --> 3560.22]  or grasp
[3560.22 --> 3560.94]  unless you
[3560.94 --> 3561.88]  know Hebrew.
[3562.96 --> 3563.28]  And so,
[3563.42 --> 3564.04]  for just a few
[3564.04 --> 3564.40]  seconds,
[3564.52 --> 3564.76]  I'm going to
[3564.76 --> 3565.36]  teach you a
[3565.36 --> 3565.86]  little bit of
[3565.86 --> 3567.00]  Hebrew so that
[3567.00 --> 3567.64]  you can see it.
[3567.64 --> 3569.36]  the question,
[3569.60 --> 3570.42]  how long,
[3570.62 --> 3571.40]  in Hebrew,
[3571.68 --> 3572.58]  is Adana.
[3573.50 --> 3574.38]  Adana.
[3574.72 --> 3574.96]  So,
[3575.04 --> 3575.84]  David cries
[3575.84 --> 3576.48]  four times,
[3576.62 --> 3577.24]  Adana,
[3577.50 --> 3578.30]  Adana,
[3578.54 --> 3579.30]  Adana,
[3579.56 --> 3580.34]  Adana.
[3581.94 --> 3582.42]  Now,
[3582.62 --> 3583.06]  if you have
[3583.06 --> 3583.74]  ears to hear,
[3583.98 --> 3584.44]  that might
[3584.44 --> 3585.30]  sound familiar
[3585.30 --> 3585.84]  to you.
[3586.32 --> 3587.12]  Because one
[3587.12 --> 3587.74]  of the Hebrew
[3587.74 --> 3588.80]  names for God
[3588.80 --> 3589.40]  that you might
[3589.40 --> 3590.24]  know is
[3590.24 --> 3591.74]  Adana.
[3593.38 --> 3593.66]  Adana.
[3593.66 --> 3594.60]  And so,
[3594.72 --> 3595.08]  there's this
[3595.08 --> 3595.90]  beautiful,
[3596.38 --> 3597.80]  poetic crying
[3597.80 --> 3598.48]  out that
[3598.48 --> 3599.74]  David is doing
[3599.74 --> 3600.46]  here that's
[3600.46 --> 3601.34]  a crying out,
[3601.46 --> 3601.98]  Adana,
[3602.34 --> 3604.32]  to almost
[3604.32 --> 3604.76]  God.
[3605.96 --> 3606.46]  Right?
[3606.52 --> 3606.78]  Or to
[3606.78 --> 3607.92]  distant God.
[3608.08 --> 3608.82]  Not quite
[3608.82 --> 3609.52]  there.
[3610.94 --> 3611.74]  And these
[3611.74 --> 3612.20]  words,
[3612.32 --> 3612.92]  Adana,
[3613.24 --> 3613.88]  Adana,
[3614.04 --> 3614.52]  over and
[3614.52 --> 3615.24]  over is a
[3615.24 --> 3616.30]  plaintive
[3616.30 --> 3617.42]  crying out.
[3617.52 --> 3617.84]  It's a sort
[3617.84 --> 3619.60]  of onomatopoetic
[3619.60 --> 3620.86]  mourning over
[3620.86 --> 3621.82]  God's absence
[3621.82 --> 3622.84]  and death.
[3622.84 --> 3624.16]  absence
[3624.16 --> 3625.54]  and distance.
[3627.66 --> 3628.86]  And in
[3628.86 --> 3629.76]  this repetition
[3629.76 --> 3631.08]  four times
[3631.08 --> 3631.58]  over and
[3631.58 --> 3631.90]  over,
[3632.20 --> 3632.76]  we see that
[3632.76 --> 3633.48]  this isn't
[3633.48 --> 3634.06]  just a
[3634.06 --> 3635.18]  passing thought.
[3635.86 --> 3635.92]  Right?
[3635.94 --> 3636.26]  This isn't
[3636.26 --> 3636.78]  just one
[3636.78 --> 3637.32]  or two
[3637.32 --> 3638.90]  hard experiences
[3638.90 --> 3640.12]  for David.
[3641.18 --> 3641.66]  And yes,
[3641.80 --> 3642.46]  of course,
[3642.56 --> 3642.92]  it's true,
[3643.02 --> 3643.18]  right?
[3643.24 --> 3643.86]  That our
[3643.86 --> 3644.56]  own hearts,
[3644.64 --> 3645.14]  and mine
[3645.14 --> 3646.02]  is just
[3646.02 --> 3646.58]  as guilty
[3646.58 --> 3647.06]  as this
[3647.06 --> 3647.36]  is the
[3647.36 --> 3647.92]  next person,
[3648.18 --> 3648.74]  our own
[3648.74 --> 3649.04]  hearts
[3649.04 --> 3650.00]  exaggerate
[3650.00 --> 3651.20]  our plights.
[3651.86 --> 3651.98]  Right?
[3651.98 --> 3652.96]  We exaggerate
[3652.96 --> 3653.46]  our own
[3653.46 --> 3654.20]  victimhood.
[3655.40 --> 3655.76]  But what
[3655.76 --> 3656.36]  is being
[3656.36 --> 3656.90]  talked about
[3656.90 --> 3657.44]  here is
[3657.44 --> 3658.22]  this season
[3658.22 --> 3658.94]  of life
[3658.94 --> 3660.08]  and experience
[3660.08 --> 3660.58]  of life
[3660.58 --> 3660.90]  that has
[3660.90 --> 3661.40]  been going
[3661.40 --> 3662.34]  on for
[3662.34 --> 3662.92]  a long
[3662.92 --> 3663.78]  time.
[3664.74 --> 3665.50]  But even
[3665.50 --> 3665.94]  more than
[3665.94 --> 3666.42]  going on
[3666.42 --> 3666.88]  for a long
[3666.88 --> 3667.28]  time,
[3667.36 --> 3667.92]  more importantly,
[3668.20 --> 3669.00]  it seems
[3669.00 --> 3669.66]  like there's
[3669.66 --> 3670.06]  going to be
[3670.06 --> 3670.82]  no end
[3670.82 --> 3671.70]  to it.
[3673.50 --> 3674.12]  And when
[3674.12 --> 3674.66]  there's no
[3674.66 --> 3675.62]  end to
[3675.62 --> 3676.78]  our struggle,
[3677.54 --> 3677.68]  right,
[3677.72 --> 3678.00]  when there's
[3678.00 --> 3678.60]  no end
[3678.60 --> 3679.22]  in sight
[3679.22 --> 3679.58]  to the
[3679.58 --> 3680.14]  pain and
[3680.14 --> 3680.52]  the hurt
[3680.52 --> 3680.82]  and the
[3680.82 --> 3681.30]  hardship,
[3681.68 --> 3683.00]  that's when
[3683.00 --> 3683.38]  we get
[3683.38 --> 3683.80]  angry.
[3685.08 --> 3685.70]  That's when
[3685.70 --> 3686.32]  frustration
[3686.32 --> 3686.96]  starts to
[3686.96 --> 3687.60]  boil over.
[3688.04 --> 3688.46]  That's when
[3688.46 --> 3689.08]  we start to
[3689.08 --> 3689.66]  say things
[3689.66 --> 3690.02]  like,
[3690.42 --> 3690.74]  if God
[3690.74 --> 3691.42]  is alive,
[3692.04 --> 3692.46]  I hate
[3692.46 --> 3692.70]  him.
[3695.26 --> 3695.74]  Now,
[3695.78 --> 3696.14]  I also
[3696.14 --> 3697.68]  know that
[3697.68 --> 3698.12]  this kind
[3698.12 --> 3698.64]  of talk
[3698.64 --> 3699.12]  makes some
[3699.12 --> 3699.38]  of us
[3699.38 --> 3699.94]  uncomfortable.
[3701.32 --> 3702.04]  And entering
[3702.04 --> 3702.54]  into these
[3702.54 --> 3702.88]  kind of
[3702.88 --> 3703.32]  moments
[3703.32 --> 3704.10]  makes some
[3704.10 --> 3704.36]  of us
[3704.36 --> 3704.48]  go,
[3704.60 --> 3704.78]  nope,
[3704.96 --> 3705.16]  nope,
[3705.54 --> 3705.96]  not doing
[3705.96 --> 3706.16]  it.
[3707.08 --> 3707.54]  And there's
[3707.54 --> 3708.28]  a temptation
[3708.28 --> 3709.24]  when you
[3709.24 --> 3709.80]  feel this
[3709.80 --> 3710.22]  way or
[3710.22 --> 3710.66]  when people
[3710.66 --> 3711.00]  in your
[3711.00 --> 3711.56]  life feel
[3711.56 --> 3712.14]  this way
[3712.14 --> 3713.10]  to rush
[3713.10 --> 3713.80]  through,
[3713.96 --> 3714.38]  right,
[3714.48 --> 3714.80]  to verse
[3714.80 --> 3715.24]  five and
[3715.24 --> 3715.64]  six of
[3715.64 --> 3716.04]  the psalm.
[3717.52 --> 3718.14]  And so
[3718.14 --> 3718.58]  we say
[3718.58 --> 3719.34]  things like,
[3719.80 --> 3720.42]  don't worry,
[3720.56 --> 3720.86]  it's going
[3720.86 --> 3721.48]  to be okay,
[3721.64 --> 3722.16]  God has a
[3722.16 --> 3722.62]  plan for
[3722.62 --> 3722.86]  you.
[3724.06 --> 3724.44]  Sometimes
[3724.44 --> 3725.16]  we hear
[3725.16 --> 3725.80]  things like,
[3726.20 --> 3726.88]  God will
[3726.88 --> 3727.36]  use this
[3727.36 --> 3727.90]  for good.
[3727.90 --> 3729.70]  And this
[3729.70 --> 3730.04]  is the
[3730.04 --> 3730.38]  sort of
[3730.38 --> 3731.10]  parroting
[3731.10 --> 3731.96]  of easy
[3731.96 --> 3732.42]  Christian
[3732.42 --> 3733.10]  answers that
[3733.10 --> 3733.98]  really frustrated
[3733.98 --> 3734.62]  Anna,
[3734.74 --> 3735.04]  that made
[3735.04 --> 3735.44]  her so
[3735.44 --> 3735.96]  angry in
[3735.96 --> 3736.50]  her story.
[3737.40 --> 3738.32]  And we
[3738.32 --> 3738.74]  can relate
[3738.74 --> 3739.16]  to that,
[3739.22 --> 3739.42]  right?
[3739.50 --> 3739.94]  In your
[3739.94 --> 3740.36]  anger,
[3740.54 --> 3740.92]  in your
[3740.92 --> 3741.42]  heart,
[3741.54 --> 3742.14]  you know
[3742.14 --> 3742.64]  that those
[3742.64 --> 3743.14]  kind of
[3743.14 --> 3743.82]  platitudes
[3743.82 --> 3744.56]  don't make
[3744.56 --> 3745.02]  you feel
[3745.02 --> 3745.36]  better.
[3745.70 --> 3746.22]  In fact,
[3746.30 --> 3746.70]  in my
[3746.70 --> 3747.28]  experience
[3747.28 --> 3747.66]  anyway,
[3747.92 --> 3748.26]  they just
[3748.26 --> 3748.68]  make us
[3748.68 --> 3749.36]  feel worse.
[3750.38 --> 3750.66]  And then
[3750.66 --> 3751.14]  we feel
[3751.14 --> 3751.80]  guilt and
[3751.80 --> 3752.50]  shame,
[3752.78 --> 3753.30]  that we
[3753.30 --> 3754.04]  feel worse.
[3755.18 --> 3755.56]  And then
[3755.56 --> 3756.02]  because we
[3756.02 --> 3756.30]  have this
[3756.30 --> 3756.84]  guilt and shame
[3756.84 --> 3757.14]  in us,
[3757.16 --> 3757.40]  we just
[3757.40 --> 3757.78]  get more
[3757.78 --> 3758.22]  angry,
[3758.88 --> 3759.28]  either at
[3759.28 --> 3760.16]  God or
[3760.16 --> 3760.84]  at ourselves,
[3761.06 --> 3761.60]  or at the
[3761.60 --> 3762.16]  people around
[3762.16 --> 3762.48]  us,
[3762.60 --> 3763.28]  or nebulously
[3763.28 --> 3763.54]  at the
[3763.54 --> 3764.06]  situation
[3764.06 --> 3764.68]  that's out
[3764.68 --> 3764.90]  of our
[3764.90 --> 3765.28]  control.
[3767.98 --> 3768.50]  Reality
[3768.50 --> 3768.96]  is,
[3769.22 --> 3770.38]  we can't
[3770.38 --> 3770.88]  rush to
[3770.88 --> 3771.40]  verse 5
[3771.40 --> 3771.96]  and 6.
[3773.84 --> 3774.66]  Because here's
[3774.66 --> 3775.06]  the thing
[3775.06 --> 3776.24]  about these
[3776.24 --> 3776.82]  platitudes.
[3779.12 --> 3779.80]  They're not
[3779.80 --> 3780.66]  actually wrong.
[3782.40 --> 3782.54]  Right?
[3782.64 --> 3782.80]  Like,
[3782.80 --> 3783.48]  it is true
[3783.48 --> 3783.90]  that God
[3783.90 --> 3784.44]  does have
[3784.44 --> 3784.82]  a plan
[3784.82 --> 3785.36]  for you.
[3786.18 --> 3786.46]  For I
[3786.46 --> 3786.92]  know the
[3786.92 --> 3787.44]  plans I
[3787.44 --> 3787.90]  have for
[3787.90 --> 3788.06]  you,
[3788.18 --> 3788.46]  declares
[3788.46 --> 3788.92]  the Lord.
[3789.22 --> 3789.50]  Jeremiah
[3789.50 --> 3789.96]  29,
[3790.06 --> 3790.32]  11.
[3791.12 --> 3791.24]  Right?
[3791.32 --> 3791.54]  Many
[3791.54 --> 3793.02]  are the
[3793.02 --> 3793.46]  things you
[3793.46 --> 3793.98]  have planned
[3793.98 --> 3794.42]  for us.
[3794.48 --> 3795.12]  Psalm 40,
[3795.60 --> 3796.22]  verse 5.
[3797.06 --> 3797.74]  The plans
[3797.74 --> 3798.04]  of the
[3798.04 --> 3798.82]  Lord stand
[3798.82 --> 3799.38]  forever.
[3799.86 --> 3800.52]  Psalm 33,
[3800.74 --> 3801.04]  11.
[3801.88 --> 3802.02]  Right?
[3802.04 --> 3802.28]  And it
[3802.28 --> 3802.76]  is true
[3802.76 --> 3803.22]  that God
[3803.22 --> 3804.22]  does and
[3804.22 --> 3805.00]  will turn
[3805.00 --> 3805.82]  all things
[3805.82 --> 3806.38]  for the
[3806.38 --> 3806.84]  good of
[3806.84 --> 3807.42]  those who
[3807.42 --> 3807.78]  love him
[3807.78 --> 3809.48]  and for
[3809.48 --> 3810.08]  his glory.
[3810.68 --> 3810.80]  Right?
[3810.86 --> 3811.40]  Romans 8,
[3811.40 --> 3811.76]  28.
[3811.90 --> 3812.24]  We know
[3812.24 --> 3812.60]  that in
[3812.60 --> 3813.06]  all things
[3813.06 --> 3813.62]  God works
[3813.62 --> 3813.90]  for the
[3813.90 --> 3814.22]  good of
[3814.22 --> 3814.56]  those who
[3814.56 --> 3815.02]  love him,
[3815.08 --> 3815.34]  who have
[3815.34 --> 3816.08]  been called
[3816.08 --> 3816.64]  according to
[3816.64 --> 3817.26]  his purpose.
[3818.02 --> 3818.82]  Or Isaiah
[3818.82 --> 3819.32]  48,
[3819.52 --> 3819.84]  11.
[3820.18 --> 3820.48]  For my
[3820.48 --> 3821.12]  own sake,
[3821.20 --> 3821.58]  for my
[3821.58 --> 3822.20]  own sake,
[3822.26 --> 3822.62]  I do
[3822.62 --> 3822.88]  this.
[3822.96 --> 3823.36]  I will
[3823.36 --> 3824.04]  not yield
[3824.04 --> 3824.86]  my glory
[3824.86 --> 3825.82]  to another.
[3827.30 --> 3827.52]  Right?
[3827.54 --> 3827.88]  That's all
[3827.88 --> 3828.20]  true.
[3828.42 --> 3828.88]  That's all
[3828.88 --> 3829.26]  in the
[3829.26 --> 3829.54]  Bible.
[3829.70 --> 3829.92]  And so,
[3830.02 --> 3830.30]  of course,
[3830.36 --> 3830.94]  I believe
[3830.94 --> 3831.28]  it and
[3831.28 --> 3831.64]  know it
[3831.64 --> 3831.96]  to be
[3831.96 --> 3832.28]  true.
[3832.86 --> 3833.64]  But those
[3833.64 --> 3834.32]  truths
[3834.32 --> 3835.44]  become
[3835.44 --> 3836.24]  platitudes
[3836.24 --> 3837.70]  when the
[3837.70 --> 3838.40]  person you
[3838.40 --> 3839.08]  say them
[3839.08 --> 3840.22]  to doesn't
[3840.22 --> 3841.22]  feel heard
[3841.22 --> 3842.38]  or understood
[3842.38 --> 3843.34]  in the
[3843.34 --> 3844.08]  context of
[3844.08 --> 3844.46]  their own
[3844.46 --> 3844.76]  pain.
[3847.12 --> 3847.70]  Do I
[3847.70 --> 3847.90]  need to
[3847.90 --> 3848.14]  say that
[3848.14 --> 3848.36]  again?
[3848.42 --> 3848.88]  Because that's
[3848.88 --> 3849.26]  profound.
[3850.76 --> 3851.28]  Those
[3851.28 --> 3851.94]  truths of
[3851.94 --> 3852.30]  Scripture
[3852.30 --> 3853.00]  become
[3853.00 --> 3853.72]  platitudes
[3853.72 --> 3854.98]  when the
[3854.98 --> 3855.52]  person you
[3855.52 --> 3855.90]  say them
[3855.90 --> 3856.48]  to doesn't
[3856.48 --> 3857.24]  feel heard
[3857.24 --> 3858.00]  or understood
[3858.00 --> 3859.02]  in their
[3859.02 --> 3859.64]  own pain.
[3860.64 --> 3861.34]  I used to
[3861.34 --> 3861.54]  have a
[3861.54 --> 3862.16]  professor in
[3862.16 --> 3862.80]  seminary who
[3862.80 --> 3863.06]  said,
[3863.48 --> 3863.78]  the right
[3863.78 --> 3864.26]  answer at
[3864.26 --> 3864.60]  the wrong
[3864.60 --> 3866.06]  time is
[3866.06 --> 3866.38]  the wrong
[3866.38 --> 3866.72]  answer.
[3866.72 --> 3869.30]  right?
[3869.34 --> 3869.60]  When you
[3869.60 --> 3870.40]  rush a
[3870.40 --> 3870.78]  grieving
[3870.78 --> 3871.96]  person to
[3871.96 --> 3872.42]  the right
[3872.42 --> 3872.94]  answer,
[3873.94 --> 3874.58]  they become
[3874.58 --> 3874.80]  bitter.
[3876.12 --> 3876.78]  When you
[3876.78 --> 3877.14]  push a
[3877.14 --> 3877.66]  truth on
[3877.66 --> 3878.32]  someone who
[3878.32 --> 3878.96]  is staring
[3878.96 --> 3879.64]  into the
[3879.64 --> 3880.14]  abyss,
[3881.26 --> 3881.94]  the abyss
[3881.94 --> 3882.58]  grows,
[3883.12 --> 3883.46]  not the
[3883.46 --> 3883.72]  truth.
[3885.10 --> 3885.76]  When you
[3885.76 --> 3886.20]  tell a
[3886.20 --> 3886.58]  person who
[3886.58 --> 3887.16]  is raging
[3887.16 --> 3887.56]  at the
[3887.56 --> 3887.90]  apparent
[3887.90 --> 3888.52]  absence of
[3888.52 --> 3889.10]  God to
[3889.10 --> 3889.48]  just get
[3889.48 --> 3890.10]  over it,
[3890.84 --> 3891.38]  they get
[3891.38 --> 3892.06]  more upset
[3892.06 --> 3894.90]  or they
[3894.90 --> 3895.42]  walk away.
[3895.42 --> 3897.10]  either from
[3897.10 --> 3898.46]  you or
[3898.46 --> 3898.88]  from God.
[3900.98 --> 3901.46]  Instead,
[3902.06 --> 3903.10]  we can't
[3903.10 --> 3903.66]  rush to
[3903.66 --> 3904.30]  verse 5 and
[3904.30 --> 3904.62]  6.
[3905.04 --> 3905.20]  Now,
[3905.92 --> 3906.24]  don't hear
[3906.24 --> 3906.44]  what I'm
[3906.44 --> 3906.76]  not saying
[3906.76 --> 3907.22]  because we
[3907.22 --> 3907.62]  will get
[3907.62 --> 3907.92]  there.
[3909.28 --> 3910.30]  But only
[3910.30 --> 3911.38]  after living
[3911.38 --> 3912.02]  in the
[3912.02 --> 3912.54]  first four
[3912.54 --> 3912.86]  verses
[3912.86 --> 3913.38]  together.
[3914.52 --> 3915.02]  Right?
[3915.08 --> 3915.26]  And so
[3915.26 --> 3915.74]  hear that
[3915.74 --> 3916.10]  as a
[3916.10 --> 3916.38]  metaphor.
[3916.78 --> 3917.46]  Only after
[3917.46 --> 3918.52]  living into
[3918.52 --> 3919.28]  the pain
[3919.28 --> 3919.82]  and the
[3919.82 --> 3920.22]  hardship
[3920.22 --> 3920.92]  and the
[3920.92 --> 3921.46]  struggle
[3921.46 --> 3922.18]  together
[3922.18 --> 3923.36]  can we
[3923.36 --> 3923.58]  get to
[3923.58 --> 3923.92]  the hope.
[3924.62 --> 3925.00]  Let's
[3925.00 --> 3925.90]  understand
[3925.90 --> 3926.54]  the anger
[3926.54 --> 3926.94]  and the
[3926.94 --> 3927.62]  crying out
[3927.62 --> 3928.28]  and only
[3928.28 --> 3929.24]  then will
[3929.24 --> 3929.70]  we have
[3929.70 --> 3930.16]  the right
[3930.16 --> 3930.70]  words to
[3930.70 --> 3931.76]  speak into
[3931.76 --> 3932.18]  someone's
[3932.18 --> 3932.46]  heart.
[3933.82 --> 3934.66]  How long?
[3935.32 --> 3935.80]  Ad
[3935.80 --> 3936.38]  anah.
[3936.90 --> 3938.02]  How long
[3938.02 --> 3938.56]  will you
[3938.56 --> 3939.28]  hide your
[3939.28 --> 3940.44]  face from
[3940.44 --> 3940.68]  me?
[3942.80 --> 3943.68]  So there's
[3943.68 --> 3944.22]  layers of
[3944.22 --> 3945.32]  meaning to
[3945.32 --> 3946.02]  that phrase.
[3947.02 --> 3947.90]  Hide your
[3947.90 --> 3948.82]  face from
[3948.82 --> 3950.26]  me is more
[3950.26 --> 3950.86]  than just an
[3950.86 --> 3952.18]  experience of
[3952.18 --> 3953.18]  God not
[3953.18 --> 3953.84]  helping when
[3953.84 --> 3954.24]  we want
[3954.24 --> 3954.26]  we want
[3954.26 --> 3954.66]  him to.
[3955.40 --> 3956.06]  Hide your
[3956.06 --> 3956.98]  face from
[3956.98 --> 3958.10]  me recalls
[3958.10 --> 3958.54]  God's
[3958.54 --> 3959.74]  blessing to
[3959.74 --> 3960.38]  the people
[3960.38 --> 3961.12]  in number
[3961.12 --> 3961.62]  six.
[3961.98 --> 3962.36]  Maybe you
[3962.36 --> 3962.94]  remember that.
[3963.04 --> 3963.60]  It's called
[3963.60 --> 3964.14]  the priestly
[3964.14 --> 3964.70]  blessing.
[3964.88 --> 3965.56]  God says to
[3965.56 --> 3966.18]  Moses and
[3966.18 --> 3966.44]  Aaron,
[3967.02 --> 3967.70]  this is how
[3967.70 --> 3968.08]  you will
[3968.08 --> 3968.52]  bless the
[3968.52 --> 3968.76]  people.
[3968.86 --> 3969.44]  This is how
[3969.44 --> 3970.10]  they will
[3970.10 --> 3970.64]  know that
[3970.64 --> 3970.94]  they are
[3970.94 --> 3971.26]  mine.
[3971.36 --> 3971.78]  This is how
[3971.78 --> 3972.16]  I will
[3972.16 --> 3972.72]  write my
[3972.72 --> 3973.32]  name on
[3973.32 --> 3973.52]  them.
[3973.54 --> 3973.72]  And he
[3973.72 --> 3974.14]  says the
[3974.14 --> 3974.76]  Lord bless
[3974.76 --> 3975.74]  you and
[3975.74 --> 3976.44]  keep you.
[3976.78 --> 3977.02]  The Lord
[3977.02 --> 3977.56]  make his
[3977.56 --> 3978.52]  face shine
[3978.52 --> 3979.68]  upon you and
[3979.68 --> 3980.26]  be gracious
[3980.26 --> 3980.74]  to you.
[3980.82 --> 3981.22]  The Lord
[3981.22 --> 3982.00]  turn his
[3982.00 --> 3982.90]  face toward
[3982.90 --> 3983.80]  you and
[3983.80 --> 3984.42]  give you
[3984.42 --> 3986.16]  his peace.
[3987.90 --> 3988.68]  The Lord
[3988.68 --> 3989.10]  make his
[3989.10 --> 3989.76]  face shine
[3989.76 --> 3990.50]  upon you and
[3990.50 --> 3990.76]  the Lord
[3990.76 --> 3991.42]  turn his
[3991.42 --> 3992.04]  face toward
[3992.04 --> 3992.42]  you.
[3992.76 --> 3993.64]  The psalmist
[3993.64 --> 3994.48]  no longer
[3994.48 --> 3996.00]  understands and
[3996.00 --> 3996.92]  sees God's
[3996.92 --> 3997.56]  face as
[3997.56 --> 3998.72]  turned towards
[3998.72 --> 3998.98]  him.
[3999.22 --> 3999.94]  He no longer
[3999.94 --> 4001.00]  feels God's
[4001.00 --> 4002.16]  face shining
[4002.16 --> 4002.90]  upon him and
[4002.90 --> 4003.58]  so he doesn't
[4003.58 --> 4004.08]  have any
[4004.08 --> 4005.16]  grace and
[4005.16 --> 4005.66]  he has no
[4005.66 --> 4006.54]  experience of
[4006.54 --> 4007.10]  peace.
[4009.26 --> 4010.08]  The turning
[4010.08 --> 4010.88]  of God's
[4010.88 --> 4011.74]  face is his
[4011.74 --> 4013.46]  presence and
[4013.46 --> 4014.24]  his presence
[4014.24 --> 4014.94]  is supposed
[4014.94 --> 4015.70]  to bring
[4015.70 --> 4016.68]  grace and
[4016.68 --> 4017.24]  peace and
[4017.24 --> 4018.04]  right now
[4018.04 --> 4019.52]  David knows
[4019.52 --> 4020.34]  neither.
[4021.90 --> 4022.70]  God promised
[4022.70 --> 4024.80]  presence and
[4024.80 --> 4025.70]  it feels like
[4025.70 --> 4026.16]  God has
[4026.16 --> 4026.98]  failed that
[4026.98 --> 4027.54]  promise.
[4029.84 --> 4030.38]  And out of
[4030.38 --> 4031.14]  that failed
[4031.14 --> 4032.44]  experience of
[4032.44 --> 4033.20]  God's promise
[4033.20 --> 4034.22]  David literally
[4034.22 --> 4034.92]  cries out
[4034.92 --> 4036.22]  how long
[4036.22 --> 4036.92]  must I
[4036.92 --> 4038.12]  wrestle with
[4038.12 --> 4038.80]  my thoughts?
[4040.18 --> 4040.64]  Now literally
[4040.64 --> 4041.32]  it says there
[4041.32 --> 4042.34]  how long
[4042.34 --> 4042.68]  must I
[4042.68 --> 4044.16]  counsel with
[4044.16 --> 4045.04]  my soul?
[4045.90 --> 4046.52]  Counsel with
[4046.52 --> 4047.02]  my inner
[4047.02 --> 4047.52]  being?
[4048.58 --> 4049.10]  Do you know
[4049.10 --> 4049.74]  what that is
[4049.74 --> 4049.98]  like?
[4050.04 --> 4050.26]  Do you ever
[4050.26 --> 4050.74]  have that?
[4050.86 --> 4051.74]  Where you're
[4051.74 --> 4052.80]  stuck kind of
[4052.80 --> 4053.46]  in your mind
[4053.46 --> 4054.08]  space just
[4054.08 --> 4054.84]  going back and
[4054.84 --> 4055.28]  forth and
[4055.28 --> 4055.80]  back and
[4055.80 --> 4056.42]  forth and
[4056.42 --> 4057.28]  this idea is
[4057.28 --> 4058.06]  bouncing around
[4058.06 --> 4058.64]  all over the
[4058.64 --> 4059.06]  place and you
[4059.06 --> 4059.58]  can't get a
[4059.58 --> 4060.14]  handle on it and
[4060.14 --> 4060.58]  when you think
[4060.58 --> 4061.18]  you've grasped
[4061.18 --> 4062.02]  it you look at
[4062.02 --> 4062.34]  it and there's
[4062.34 --> 4062.94]  nothing there and
[4062.94 --> 4064.00]  it pops up over
[4064.00 --> 4065.02]  here and there's
[4065.02 --> 4065.66]  just this
[4065.66 --> 4069.40]  angst or
[4069.40 --> 4070.20]  anxiety
[4070.20 --> 4072.42]  this hurt
[4072.42 --> 4074.60]  and brokenness
[4074.60 --> 4076.40]  and then
[4076.40 --> 4078.12]  that begins to
[4078.12 --> 4079.12]  show itself
[4079.12 --> 4080.68]  in you
[4080.68 --> 4080.94]  right?
[4080.98 --> 4081.46]  Whenever we have
[4081.46 --> 4082.14]  these internal
[4082.14 --> 4082.98]  emotions they
[4082.98 --> 4083.78]  have a tendency
[4083.78 --> 4084.50]  to manifest
[4084.50 --> 4085.18]  themselves
[4085.18 --> 4086.12]  physiologically
[4086.12 --> 4086.66]  and I'm not
[4086.66 --> 4087.06]  just talking
[4087.06 --> 4087.74]  about crying
[4087.74 --> 4089.10]  right?
[4089.20 --> 4089.98]  So for me
[4089.98 --> 4091.14]  when I get
[4091.14 --> 4092.76]  anxious I
[4092.76 --> 4093.32]  start to feel
[4093.32 --> 4093.72]  that in my
[4093.72 --> 4095.18]  hands like
[4095.18 --> 4095.76]  my hands
[4095.76 --> 4097.04]  feel cold
[4097.04 --> 4097.78]  and tingly
[4097.78 --> 4098.62]  and that's
[4098.62 --> 4099.20]  a cue for
[4099.20 --> 4099.52]  me that
[4099.52 --> 4100.14]  there's some
[4100.14 --> 4100.80]  anxiety going
[4100.80 --> 4101.20]  on here
[4101.20 --> 4102.40]  and I have
[4102.40 --> 4102.80]  to learn how
[4102.80 --> 4103.60]  to get aware
[4103.60 --> 4104.06]  of that
[4104.06 --> 4104.34]  right?
[4104.46 --> 4105.06]  And how to
[4105.06 --> 4105.84]  take that
[4105.84 --> 4106.52]  and to use
[4106.52 --> 4106.96]  that but then
[4106.96 --> 4107.46]  when that
[4107.46 --> 4108.42]  anxiety grows
[4108.42 --> 4109.44]  and turns
[4109.44 --> 4110.28]  into anger
[4110.28 --> 4111.06]  and I start
[4111.06 --> 4111.62]  to feel that
[4111.62 --> 4112.40]  in my chest
[4112.40 --> 4114.08]  right?
[4114.16 --> 4114.38]  And then when
[4114.38 --> 4115.04]  I get really
[4115.04 --> 4115.76]  angry it comes
[4115.76 --> 4116.20]  up to my
[4116.20 --> 4117.32]  neck and it
[4117.32 --> 4118.66]  sits here in
[4118.66 --> 4119.40]  my neck and
[4119.40 --> 4120.32]  it's tight and
[4120.32 --> 4120.86]  there's nothing
[4120.86 --> 4121.58]  I can do about
[4121.58 --> 4122.20]  it and that's
[4122.20 --> 4122.78]  just the way it
[4122.78 --> 4123.28]  is and
[4123.28 --> 4124.00]  here I am
[4124.00 --> 4126.04]  and that's
[4126.04 --> 4126.58]  what's happening
[4126.58 --> 4128.36]  in Psalm 13.
[4129.72 --> 4130.50]  He's holding
[4130.50 --> 4131.00]  his anger
[4131.00 --> 4131.60]  tight
[4131.60 --> 4134.62]  and again
[4134.62 --> 4136.78]  not just
[4136.78 --> 4137.44]  for a short
[4137.44 --> 4138.44]  passing
[4138.44 --> 4139.60]  moment
[4139.60 --> 4140.60]  right?
[4140.74 --> 4141.16]  Day
[4141.16 --> 4142.66]  after day
[4142.66 --> 4144.10]  I have sorrow
[4144.10 --> 4145.44]  in my heart
[4145.44 --> 4146.94]  and this is
[4146.94 --> 4147.48]  long
[4147.48 --> 4148.84]  and ongoing
[4148.84 --> 4150.52]  and then
[4150.52 --> 4150.90]  building
[4150.90 --> 4151.60]  through the
[4151.60 --> 4151.98]  Psalm
[4151.98 --> 4152.50]  right?
[4152.50 --> 4152.84]  in these
[4152.84 --> 4153.78]  short verses
[4153.78 --> 4154.74]  by verse
[4154.74 --> 4155.12]  3
[4155.12 --> 4155.96]  either
[4155.96 --> 4157.62]  he's shouting
[4157.62 --> 4158.50]  and shaking
[4158.50 --> 4159.02]  his fist
[4159.02 --> 4159.52]  at the heavens
[4159.52 --> 4160.54]  look on me
[4160.54 --> 4161.22]  and answer
[4161.22 --> 4161.96]  oh God
[4161.96 --> 4163.76]  or
[4163.76 --> 4165.50]  maybe he's
[4165.50 --> 4165.86]  broken
[4165.86 --> 4167.22]  and he's
[4167.22 --> 4167.80]  weeping
[4167.80 --> 4168.70]  and he's
[4168.70 --> 4169.08]  hiding
[4169.08 --> 4170.18]  in the corner
[4170.18 --> 4170.58]  and he's
[4170.58 --> 4171.04]  saying give
[4171.04 --> 4171.78]  light to my
[4171.78 --> 4172.32]  eyes
[4172.32 --> 4173.18]  or I will
[4173.18 --> 4173.66]  sleep
[4173.66 --> 4174.90]  in death
[4174.90 --> 4177.36]  either way
[4177.36 --> 4177.98]  he has
[4177.98 --> 4178.72]  come to
[4178.72 --> 4179.56]  the fullest
[4179.56 --> 4180.70]  expression
[4180.70 --> 4182.02]  of his
[4182.02 --> 4182.68]  feeling
[4182.68 --> 4186.12]  and then again
[4186.12 --> 4187.98]  in that verse
[4187.98 --> 4188.36]  there
[4188.36 --> 4188.80]  in verse
[4188.80 --> 4189.74]  3
[4189.74 --> 4190.40]  says
[4190.40 --> 4191.16]  make my
[4191.16 --> 4191.56]  eyes
[4191.56 --> 4192.24]  shine
[4192.24 --> 4193.08]  lest I
[4193.08 --> 4193.50]  sleep
[4193.50 --> 4194.18]  in death
[4194.18 --> 4195.76]  right?
[4195.76 --> 4196.16]  it's the
[4196.16 --> 4196.92]  same word
[4196.92 --> 4197.40]  from the
[4197.40 --> 4197.86]  priestly
[4197.86 --> 4198.64]  blessing
[4198.64 --> 4199.04]  that we've
[4199.04 --> 4199.24]  already
[4199.24 --> 4199.70]  seen
[4199.70 --> 4200.44]  right?
[4200.56 --> 4200.84]  may the
[4200.84 --> 4201.04]  Lord
[4201.04 --> 4201.52]  make his
[4201.52 --> 4201.88]  face
[4201.88 --> 4202.64]  shine
[4202.64 --> 4203.54]  upon you
[4203.54 --> 4203.82]  David
[4203.82 --> 4204.38]  is saying
[4204.38 --> 4205.22]  look on me
[4205.22 --> 4205.72]  and answer
[4205.72 --> 4206.24]  turn your
[4206.24 --> 4206.90]  face towards
[4206.90 --> 4207.06]  me
[4207.06 --> 4207.42]  that I
[4207.42 --> 4208.28]  may again
[4208.28 --> 4209.22]  reflect the
[4209.22 --> 4209.82]  shine
[4209.82 --> 4210.72]  of your
[4210.72 --> 4211.18]  presence
[4211.18 --> 4211.64]  that I
[4211.64 --> 4212.10]  may again
[4212.10 --> 4212.82]  reflect the
[4212.82 --> 4213.28]  shine
[4213.28 --> 4213.92]  of your
[4213.92 --> 4214.28]  glory
[4214.28 --> 4214.70]  and your
[4214.70 --> 4214.98]  peace
[4214.98 --> 4215.66]  and if
[4215.66 --> 4216.06]  you do
[4216.06 --> 4216.66]  not
[4216.66 --> 4218.10]  I
[4218.10 --> 4218.84]  will
[4218.84 --> 4219.84]  die
[4219.84 --> 4224.82]  and so
[4224.82 --> 4225.34]  now
[4225.34 --> 4228.18]  now
[4228.18 --> 4228.60]  we're at
[4228.60 --> 4229.22]  the place
[4229.22 --> 4230.96]  where we've
[4230.96 --> 4231.30]  held
[4231.30 --> 4232.38]  that emotion
[4232.38 --> 4233.64]  we've held
[4233.64 --> 4234.20]  that anger
[4234.20 --> 4234.64]  and we've
[4234.64 --> 4235.22]  looked at
[4235.22 --> 4235.44]  it
[4235.44 --> 4236.08]  and we've
[4236.08 --> 4236.84]  looked at
[4236.84 --> 4237.18]  it from
[4237.18 --> 4238.14]  various sides
[4238.14 --> 4238.72]  and facets
[4238.72 --> 4239.24]  we've
[4239.24 --> 4239.80]  entered
[4239.80 --> 4240.66]  into it
[4240.66 --> 4241.08]  with the
[4241.08 --> 4241.60]  psalmist
[4241.60 --> 4241.98]  right?
[4242.08 --> 4242.80]  and seeing
[4242.80 --> 4243.84]  our anger
[4243.84 --> 4244.68]  more clearly
[4244.68 --> 4245.76]  allows us
[4245.76 --> 4246.24]  to begin
[4246.24 --> 4246.96]  to see
[4246.96 --> 4247.68]  what it
[4247.68 --> 4248.46]  truly is
[4248.46 --> 4250.18]  and I
[4250.18 --> 4251.22]  I'll share
[4251.22 --> 4251.74]  this one
[4251.74 --> 4252.24]  with you
[4252.24 --> 4253.16]  I love
[4253.16 --> 4253.54]  the way
[4253.54 --> 4254.10]  that Allender
[4254.10 --> 4254.68]  and Longman
[4254.68 --> 4255.90]  in their
[4255.90 --> 4256.14]  book
[4256.14 --> 4256.48]  The Cry
[4256.48 --> 4256.98]  of the Soul
[4256.98 --> 4257.80]  they summarize
[4257.80 --> 4258.14]  it
[4258.14 --> 4258.60]  they say
[4258.60 --> 4260.50]  the core
[4260.50 --> 4261.44]  of unrighteous
[4261.44 --> 4261.90]  anger
[4261.90 --> 4262.68]  is a
[4262.68 --> 4263.08]  hatred
[4263.08 --> 4264.10]  of vulnerability
[4264.10 --> 4265.54]  and a
[4265.54 --> 4265.98]  love
[4265.98 --> 4266.86]  of control
[4266.86 --> 4269.42]  so as
[4269.42 --> 4269.82]  you look
[4269.82 --> 4270.14]  at your
[4270.14 --> 4270.90]  own life
[4270.90 --> 4271.36]  here
[4271.36 --> 4272.32]  in this
[4272.32 --> 4272.68]  moment
[4272.68 --> 4273.78]  or maybe
[4273.78 --> 4274.36]  this is a
[4274.36 --> 4274.64]  point of
[4274.64 --> 4275.10]  application
[4275.10 --> 4275.48]  for you
[4275.48 --> 4275.90]  to take
[4275.90 --> 4276.50]  throughout
[4276.50 --> 4276.94]  the week
[4276.94 --> 4277.70]  as you
[4277.70 --> 4278.04]  look at
[4278.04 --> 4278.36]  your own
[4278.36 --> 4278.56]  life
[4278.56 --> 4279.18]  where does
[4279.18 --> 4279.90]  your anger
[4279.90 --> 4281.06]  come from?
[4282.00 --> 4282.30]  does your
[4282.30 --> 4283.30]  anger show up
[4283.30 --> 4284.12]  when you realize
[4284.12 --> 4284.64]  your own
[4284.64 --> 4285.06]  weakness
[4285.06 --> 4285.66]  or your own
[4285.66 --> 4286.10]  inability?
[4286.68 --> 4287.16]  does anger
[4287.16 --> 4287.70]  show up
[4287.70 --> 4288.08]  when you are
[4288.08 --> 4288.78]  bumping up
[4288.78 --> 4289.30]  against the
[4289.30 --> 4289.62]  limits
[4289.62 --> 4290.26]  of your
[4290.26 --> 4291.20]  control
[4291.20 --> 4291.72]  or the
[4291.72 --> 4292.66]  area over
[4292.66 --> 4293.12]  which you
[4293.12 --> 4294.12]  have exercised
[4294.12 --> 4294.66]  control?
[4295.74 --> 4295.90]  right?
[4295.92 --> 4296.72]  when you realize
[4296.72 --> 4297.08]  that you are
[4297.08 --> 4297.82]  powerless to
[4297.82 --> 4298.22]  change a
[4298.22 --> 4298.74]  situation
[4298.74 --> 4299.94]  or let's
[4299.94 --> 4300.72]  get practical
[4300.72 --> 4301.16]  when you are
[4301.16 --> 4301.88]  powerless to
[4301.88 --> 4302.38]  change your
[4302.38 --> 4302.78]  spouse
[4302.78 --> 4303.32]  or you are
[4303.32 --> 4304.04]  powerless to
[4304.04 --> 4304.50]  change your
[4304.50 --> 4304.88]  kids
[4304.88 --> 4305.58]  or when you
[4305.58 --> 4306.08]  figure out
[4306.08 --> 4306.44]  that you are
[4306.44 --> 4307.10]  powerless to
[4307.10 --> 4307.48]  change your
[4307.48 --> 4308.14]  boss
[4308.14 --> 4308.88]  right?
[4309.04 --> 4309.68]  is that when
[4309.68 --> 4310.32]  you get angry?
[4311.94 --> 4312.74]  or let's
[4312.74 --> 4313.60]  put a finer
[4313.60 --> 4314.28]  point on it
[4314.28 --> 4316.52]  are you angry
[4316.52 --> 4317.14]  at God
[4317.14 --> 4317.82]  who is in
[4317.82 --> 4318.32]  control
[4318.32 --> 4319.58]  or are you
[4319.58 --> 4320.50]  really angry
[4320.50 --> 4321.36]  that you are
[4321.36 --> 4321.70]  not?
[4327.12 --> 4327.70]  and so
[4327.70 --> 4328.40]  having entered
[4328.40 --> 4330.52]  into the
[4330.52 --> 4331.02]  anger
[4331.02 --> 4332.64]  to the point
[4332.64 --> 4333.26]  of death
[4333.26 --> 4335.90]  right?
[4335.90 --> 4336.54]  having entered
[4336.54 --> 4337.42]  into what
[4337.42 --> 4338.08]  seems like
[4338.08 --> 4338.64]  the victory
[4338.64 --> 4339.14]  of his
[4339.14 --> 4339.44]  enemy
[4339.44 --> 4340.10]  having walked
[4340.10 --> 4340.54]  the road
[4340.54 --> 4340.84]  together
[4340.84 --> 4341.52]  having heard
[4341.52 --> 4342.62]  and understood
[4342.62 --> 4343.58]  his pain
[4343.58 --> 4344.48]  now
[4344.48 --> 4346.64]  now we
[4346.64 --> 4346.98]  can
[4346.98 --> 4348.20]  speak
[4348.20 --> 4348.74]  verse 5
[4348.74 --> 4349.22]  and 6
[4349.22 --> 4350.88]  right?
[4350.96 --> 4351.46]  now we
[4351.46 --> 4352.06]  can say
[4352.06 --> 4353.20]  but I
[4353.20 --> 4353.58]  trust in
[4353.58 --> 4354.14]  your unfailing
[4354.14 --> 4354.60]  love
[4354.60 --> 4355.10]  my heart
[4355.10 --> 4355.78]  rejoices in
[4355.78 --> 4356.42]  your salvation
[4356.42 --> 4357.54]  or to put it
[4357.54 --> 4358.00]  another way
[4358.00 --> 4359.94]  it's not
[4359.94 --> 4360.84]  good news
[4360.84 --> 4362.00]  if you skip
[4362.00 --> 4362.40]  over the
[4362.40 --> 4362.78]  cross
[4362.78 --> 4366.28]  but I
[4366.28 --> 4366.88]  trust
[4366.88 --> 4368.20]  in your
[4368.20 --> 4368.80]  unfailing
[4368.80 --> 4369.24]  love
[4369.24 --> 4372.32]  now there
[4372.32 --> 4372.84]  are times
[4372.84 --> 4373.22]  when we
[4373.22 --> 4373.64]  hear this
[4373.64 --> 4374.06]  verse
[4374.06 --> 4375.74]  and I
[4375.74 --> 4376.12]  think that
[4376.12 --> 4376.60]  it remains
[4376.60 --> 4377.44]  difficult for
[4377.44 --> 4378.02]  our hearing
[4378.02 --> 4378.74]  because we
[4378.74 --> 4379.14]  think of
[4379.14 --> 4379.70]  trust
[4379.70 --> 4380.96]  as another
[4380.96 --> 4381.56]  emotion
[4381.56 --> 4383.24]  right?
[4383.24 --> 4383.94]  if anger
[4383.94 --> 4384.64]  is usually
[4384.64 --> 4385.24]  a negative
[4385.24 --> 4385.84]  emotion
[4385.84 --> 4386.58]  we think
[4386.58 --> 4387.00]  of trust
[4387.00 --> 4387.46]  as a good
[4387.46 --> 4387.84]  emotion
[4387.84 --> 4388.14]  and so
[4388.14 --> 4388.50]  instead of
[4388.50 --> 4388.90]  this negative
[4388.90 --> 4389.34]  emotion
[4389.34 --> 4390.08]  have this
[4390.08 --> 4390.52]  positive
[4390.52 --> 4390.88]  one
[4390.88 --> 4391.46]  in its
[4391.46 --> 4391.84]  place
[4391.84 --> 4392.52]  and while
[4392.52 --> 4392.94]  there are
[4392.94 --> 4393.56]  emotional
[4393.56 --> 4394.22]  or emotive
[4394.22 --> 4394.62]  aspects
[4394.62 --> 4395.26]  to our
[4395.26 --> 4395.68]  trust
[4395.68 --> 4396.10]  and to
[4396.10 --> 4396.36]  our
[4396.36 --> 4397.02]  faith
[4397.02 --> 4397.44]  that's
[4397.44 --> 4397.76]  not
[4397.76 --> 4398.02]  what
[4398.02 --> 4398.30]  this
[4398.30 --> 4398.56]  is
[4398.56 --> 4398.98]  about
[4398.98 --> 4400.28]  right?
[4400.30 --> 4400.64]  the word
[4400.64 --> 4401.26]  trust
[4401.26 --> 4402.22]  is used
[4402.22 --> 4402.66]  in this
[4402.66 --> 4403.04]  text
[4403.04 --> 4403.46]  in the
[4403.46 --> 4404.38]  perfect
[4404.38 --> 4404.98]  tense
[4404.98 --> 4405.22]  now
[4405.22 --> 4406.18]  again
[4406.18 --> 4406.42]  we're
[4406.42 --> 4406.64]  dealing
[4406.64 --> 4407.10]  with grammar
[4407.10 --> 4407.42]  and so
[4407.42 --> 4407.62]  I don't
[4407.62 --> 4408.04]  expect you
[4408.04 --> 4408.34]  to know
[4408.34 --> 4408.64]  what that
[4408.64 --> 4408.88]  means
[4408.88 --> 4409.08]  but
[4409.08 --> 4409.86]  in Hebrew
[4409.86 --> 4410.20]  grammar
[4410.20 --> 4410.74]  the perfect
[4410.74 --> 4411.08]  tense
[4411.08 --> 4411.82]  is used
[4411.82 --> 4412.84]  to describe
[4412.84 --> 4413.56]  an action
[4413.56 --> 4414.20]  that is
[4414.20 --> 4415.10]  settled
[4415.10 --> 4415.94]  in the
[4415.94 --> 4416.40]  past
[4416.40 --> 4417.26]  that is
[4417.26 --> 4417.88]  done
[4417.88 --> 4418.88]  and accomplished
[4418.88 --> 4419.40]  and then
[4419.40 --> 4419.76]  has
[4419.76 --> 4420.58]  ongoing
[4420.58 --> 4421.12]  effects
[4421.12 --> 4421.58]  into
[4421.58 --> 4422.20]  the
[4422.20 --> 4422.58]  present
[4422.58 --> 4424.04]  and so
[4424.04 --> 4424.38]  what that
[4424.38 --> 4424.58]  means
[4424.58 --> 4424.92]  is the
[4424.92 --> 4425.36]  trust
[4425.36 --> 4425.76]  here
[4425.76 --> 4426.38]  is a
[4426.38 --> 4426.90]  decision
[4426.90 --> 4427.66]  that was
[4427.66 --> 4428.06]  made
[4428.06 --> 4428.48]  in the
[4428.48 --> 4429.00]  past
[4429.00 --> 4430.00]  that now
[4430.00 --> 4430.84]  defines
[4430.84 --> 4431.36]  your
[4431.36 --> 4431.78]  current
[4431.78 --> 4432.48]  reality
[4432.48 --> 4434.72]  right?
[4434.82 --> 4435.18]  David is
[4435.18 --> 4435.46]  saying
[4435.46 --> 4436.18]  I trusted
[4436.18 --> 4436.44]  you
[4436.44 --> 4437.08]  I believe
[4437.08 --> 4437.52]  you
[4437.52 --> 4438.36]  I know
[4438.36 --> 4438.68]  you
[4438.68 --> 4439.06]  and I
[4439.06 --> 4439.26]  am
[4439.26 --> 4439.60]  known
[4439.60 --> 4439.90]  by
[4439.90 --> 4440.18]  you
[4440.18 --> 4440.74]  he's
[4440.74 --> 4441.38]  relying
[4441.38 --> 4441.92]  on a
[4441.92 --> 4442.38]  profession
[4442.38 --> 4442.70]  of
[4442.70 --> 4443.02]  faith
[4443.02 --> 4443.60]  made
[4443.60 --> 4443.78]  in
[4443.78 --> 4443.92]  the
[4443.92 --> 4444.32]  past
[4444.32 --> 4444.58]  that
[4444.58 --> 4445.24]  defines
[4445.24 --> 4446.18]  reality
[4446.18 --> 4447.22]  for the
[4447.22 --> 4447.60]  present
[4447.60 --> 4449.06]  and so
[4449.06 --> 4449.24]  there's
[4449.24 --> 4449.60]  a really
[4449.60 --> 4449.86]  good
[4449.86 --> 4450.38]  example
[4450.38 --> 4451.04]  for those
[4451.04 --> 4451.30]  of us
[4451.30 --> 4451.60]  in
[4451.60 --> 4452.68]  Christian
[4452.68 --> 4453.06]  faith
[4453.06 --> 4453.32]  right?
[4453.76 --> 4454.32]  the idea
[4454.32 --> 4454.52]  of
[4454.52 --> 4455.22]  conversion
[4455.22 --> 4456.10]  is the
[4456.10 --> 4456.50]  example
[4456.50 --> 4456.80]  here
[4456.80 --> 4457.58]  conversion
[4457.58 --> 4457.90]  in the
[4457.90 --> 4458.10]  life
[4458.10 --> 4458.34]  of the
[4458.34 --> 4458.62]  believer
[4458.62 --> 4459.00]  is a
[4459.00 --> 4459.12]  good
[4459.12 --> 4459.42]  example
[4459.42 --> 4459.66]  of what
[4459.66 --> 4459.76]  we're
[4459.76 --> 4460.10]  talking
[4460.10 --> 4460.42]  about
[4460.42 --> 4460.82]  or
[4460.82 --> 4461.38]  accepting
[4461.38 --> 4461.66]  the
[4461.66 --> 4462.04]  truths
[4462.04 --> 4462.52]  of
[4462.52 --> 4462.78]  faith
[4462.78 --> 4463.28]  making
[4463.28 --> 4463.58]  a
[4463.58 --> 4464.12]  profession
[4464.12 --> 4464.54]  of
[4464.54 --> 4465.00]  faith
[4465.00 --> 4465.48]  that's
[4465.48 --> 4465.64]  maybe
[4465.64 --> 4466.04]  language
[4466.04 --> 4466.32]  you're
[4466.32 --> 4466.62]  more
[4466.62 --> 4466.96]  familiar
[4466.96 --> 4467.20]  with
[4467.20 --> 4467.42]  is what
[4467.42 --> 4467.52]  we're
[4467.52 --> 4467.84]  talking
[4467.84 --> 4468.10]  about
[4468.10 --> 4468.34]  here
[4468.34 --> 4468.78]  right?
[4468.84 --> 4468.92]  that
[4468.92 --> 4469.48]  profession
[4469.48 --> 4469.74]  of
[4469.74 --> 4469.98]  faith
[4469.98 --> 4470.30]  moment
[4470.30 --> 4470.70]  is a
[4470.70 --> 4471.26]  reality
[4471.26 --> 4472.12]  defining
[4472.12 --> 4473.04]  moment
[4473.04 --> 4473.70]  your
[4473.70 --> 4474.44]  experience
[4474.44 --> 4474.74]  of
[4474.74 --> 4475.12]  faith
[4475.12 --> 4475.54]  at
[4475.54 --> 4475.80]  some
[4475.80 --> 4476.14]  point
[4476.14 --> 4476.38]  in
[4476.38 --> 4476.56]  the
[4476.56 --> 4477.04]  future
[4477.04 --> 4478.20]  right?
[4478.64 --> 4479.18]  at some
[4479.18 --> 4479.52]  moment
[4479.52 --> 4479.74]  will
[4479.74 --> 4480.20]  probably
[4480.20 --> 4480.64]  wane
[4480.64 --> 4481.52]  you
[4481.52 --> 4481.76]  will
[4481.76 --> 4482.04]  have
[4482.04 --> 4482.54]  doubts
[4482.54 --> 4483.94]  but
[4483.94 --> 4484.14]  your
[4484.14 --> 4484.68]  doubts
[4484.68 --> 4485.20]  don't
[4485.20 --> 4485.74]  change
[4485.74 --> 4485.98]  the
[4485.98 --> 4486.78]  reality
[4486.78 --> 4487.72]  that

[4488.30 --> 4488.50]  that
[4488.50 --> 4488.94]  profession
[4488.94 --> 4489.16]  when

[4494.96 --> 4497.18]  right?
[4497.22 --> 4497.32]  the
[4497.32 --> 4497.72]  one
[4497.72 --> 4498.08]  whom
[4498.08 --> 4498.28]  you

[4500.98 --> 4501.46]  and
[4501.46 --> 4501.64]  that
[4501.64 --> 4502.28]  changes
[4502.28 --> 4503.00]  the

[4503.58 --> 4504.12]  world
[4504.12 --> 4504.64]  for
[4504.64 --> 4504.98]  you
[4504.98 --> 4507.94]  one of
[4507.94 --> 4508.08]  my
[4508.08 --> 4508.36]  favorite
[4508.36 --> 4508.64]  verses

[4510.70 --> 4511.18]  13
[4511.18 --> 4512.48]  if we

[4519.36 --> 4519.56]  the
[4519.56 --> 4519.98]  basis
[4519.98 --> 4521.20]  of

[4571.12 --> 4571.68]  believed
[4571.68 --> 4571.96]  in
[4571.96 --> 4572.64]  even
[4572.64 --> 4572.90]  in
[4572.90 --> 4573.06]  the

[4584.72 --> 4585.00]  may
[4585.00 --> 4585.44]  even
[4585.44 --> 4585.84]  here
[4585.84 --> 4586.10]  and
[4586.10 --> 4586.50]  now
[4586.50 --> 4586.92]  I
[4586.92 --> 4587.76]  worship
[4587.76 --> 4588.96]  you
[4588.96 --> 4591.10]  I think
[4591.10 --> 4591.58]  the lesson
[4591.58 --> 4592.18]  here for
[4592.18 --> 4592.44]  us
[4592.44 --> 4593.00]  the application
[4593.00 --> 4593.40]  here for
[4593.40 --> 4593.60]  us
[4593.60 --> 4594.10]  is that
[4594.10 --> 4594.62]  sometimes
[4594.62 --> 4595.38]  we just
[4595.38 --> 4595.92]  gotta preach
[4595.92 --> 4596.42]  the gospel
[4596.42 --> 4597.22]  to ourselves
[4597.22 --> 4598.46]  right
[4598.46 --> 4598.70]  you know
[4598.70 --> 4599.00]  how it
[4599.00 --> 4599.26]  is
[4599.26 --> 4599.52]  you know
[4599.52 --> 4600.00]  that the
[4600.00 --> 4600.30]  voice
[4600.30 --> 4600.68]  in your
[4600.68 --> 4600.86]  own
[4600.86 --> 4601.16]  head
[4601.16 --> 4601.62]  works
[4601.62 --> 4602.06]  right
[4602.06 --> 4602.98]  that it
[4602.98 --> 4603.64]  overwhelms
[4603.64 --> 4603.92]  you
[4603.92 --> 4604.62]  with saying
[4604.62 --> 4604.90]  that you
[4604.90 --> 4605.18]  are not
[4605.18 --> 4605.58]  enough
[4605.58 --> 4606.10]  you are
[4606.10 --> 4606.50]  not good
[4606.50 --> 4606.80]  enough
[4606.80 --> 4607.04]  you are
[4607.04 --> 4607.60]  not worthy
[4607.60 --> 4608.30]  it overwhelms
[4608.30 --> 4608.58]  you by
[4608.58 --> 4608.84]  saying
[4608.84 --> 4609.36]  that was
[4609.36 --> 4609.94]  unfair
[4609.94 --> 4610.44]  that shouldn't
[4610.44 --> 4610.58]  have
[4610.58 --> 4611.08]  happened
[4611.08 --> 4611.44]  to you
[4611.44 --> 4611.76]  that was
[4611.76 --> 4612.38]  unjust
[4612.38 --> 4613.38]  and perhaps
[4613.38 --> 4614.22]  just like
[4614.22 --> 4614.90]  Jesus says
[4614.90 --> 4615.30]  to Peter
[4615.30 --> 4615.70]  sometimes
[4615.70 --> 4616.30]  we need
[4616.30 --> 4616.68]  to say
[4616.68 --> 4617.16]  to our
[4617.16 --> 4617.52]  own
[4617.52 --> 4618.00]  hearts
[4618.00 --> 4618.22]  and
[4618.22 --> 4618.84]  imaginations
[4618.84 --> 4619.74]  get behind
[4619.74 --> 4620.02]  me
[4620.02 --> 4620.34]  Satan
[4620.34 --> 4621.52]  right
[4621.52 --> 4621.88]  we need
[4621.88 --> 4622.22]  to hear
[4622.22 --> 4622.72]  the words
[4622.72 --> 4623.28]  of Jesus
[4623.28 --> 4623.84]  for our
[4623.84 --> 4624.10]  own
[4624.10 --> 4624.40]  heart
[4624.40 --> 4624.86]  and mind
[4624.86 --> 4625.50]  Jesus
[4625.50 --> 4626.08]  who said
[4626.08 --> 4626.62]  come to
[4626.62 --> 4626.84]  me
[4626.84 --> 4627.22]  all
[4627.22 --> 4627.46]  who
[4627.46 --> 4627.64]  are
[4627.64 --> 4628.02]  weary
[4628.02 --> 4628.80]  and heavy
[4628.80 --> 4629.14]  laden
[4629.14 --> 4629.60]  and I
[4629.60 --> 4630.06]  will
[4630.06 --> 4630.42]  give
[4630.42 --> 4630.74]  you
[4630.74 --> 4631.58]  rest
[4631.58 --> 4632.62]  Jesus
[4632.62 --> 4632.90]  who
[4632.90 --> 4633.28]  entered
[4633.28 --> 4633.68]  into
[4633.68 --> 4633.88]  the
[4633.88 --> 4634.30]  pain
[4634.30 --> 4634.88]  and the
[4634.88 --> 4635.50]  brokenness
[4635.50 --> 4635.96]  of our
[4635.96 --> 4636.26]  world
[4636.26 --> 4636.72]  and lived
[4636.72 --> 4637.12]  the life
[4637.12 --> 4637.74]  I should
[4637.74 --> 4638.18]  have lived
[4638.18 --> 4638.66]  and died
[4638.66 --> 4639.18]  the death
[4639.18 --> 4639.56]  that I
[4639.56 --> 4640.22]  deserved
[4640.22 --> 4640.90]  Jesus
[4640.90 --> 4641.48]  who bore
[4641.48 --> 4642.04]  the full
[4642.04 --> 4642.48]  wrath
[4642.48 --> 4642.90]  of God
[4642.90 --> 4643.18]  the full
[4643.18 --> 4643.58]  anger
[4643.58 --> 4644.08]  of God
[4644.08 --> 4644.96]  for my
[4644.96 --> 4645.36]  sin
[4645.36 --> 4646.14]  he bore
[4646.14 --> 4646.32]  it
[4646.32 --> 4646.94]  on the
[4646.94 --> 4647.36]  cross
[4647.36 --> 4647.84]  endured
[4647.84 --> 4648.12]  its
[4648.12 --> 4648.52]  pain
[4648.52 --> 4649.42]  and scored
[4649.42 --> 4649.72]  its
[4649.72 --> 4650.08]  shame
[4650.08 --> 4652.12]  may my
[4652.12 --> 4652.68]  heart
[4652.68 --> 4653.50]  rejoice
[4653.50 --> 4654.64]  in your
[4654.64 --> 4655.34]  salvation
[4655.34 --> 4657.10]  and when
[4657.10 --> 4657.56]  David wrote
[4657.56 --> 4658.04]  that line
[4658.04 --> 4658.58]  he didn't
[4658.58 --> 4658.98]  know the
[4658.98 --> 4659.48]  full scope
[4659.48 --> 4659.82]  of what
[4659.82 --> 4660.14]  he was
[4660.14 --> 4660.48]  talking
[4660.48 --> 4660.78]  about
[4660.78 --> 4660.96]  here
[4660.96 --> 4661.58]  but there's
[4661.58 --> 4662.02]  this beautiful
[4662.02 --> 4662.58]  thing going
[4662.58 --> 4663.16]  on in that
[4663.16 --> 4663.74]  phrase
[4663.74 --> 4664.36]  the word
[4664.36 --> 4664.78]  that David
[4664.78 --> 4665.38]  uses for
[4665.38 --> 4665.86]  salvation
[4665.86 --> 4666.72]  is Yeshua
[4666.72 --> 4668.58]  which becomes
[4668.58 --> 4669.08]  a name
[4669.08 --> 4669.90]  Joshua
[4669.90 --> 4671.08]  which in
[4671.08 --> 4671.48]  Greek
[4671.48 --> 4672.12]  and it's
[4672.12 --> 4672.28]  Greek
[4672.28 --> 4672.68]  pronunciation
[4672.68 --> 4673.36]  we know
[4673.36 --> 4673.70]  as
[4673.70 --> 4674.80]  Jesus
[4674.80 --> 4677.10]  may I
[4677.10 --> 4677.78]  rejoice
[4677.78 --> 4679.10]  in your
[4679.10 --> 4680.28]  Jesus
[4680.28 --> 4682.32]  Yeshua
[4682.32 --> 4683.56]  Messiah
[4683.56 --> 4684.00]  Jesus
[4684.00 --> 4684.78]  Messiah
[4684.78 --> 4685.34]  Jesus
[4685.34 --> 4686.40]  Christ
[4686.40 --> 4687.04]  we need
[4687.04 --> 4687.50]  to preach
[4687.50 --> 4688.10]  the gospel
[4688.10 --> 4688.80]  to ourselves
[4688.80 --> 4689.36]  in these
[4689.36 --> 4689.84]  moments of
[4689.84 --> 4690.24]  anger
[4690.24 --> 4691.02]  in these
[4691.02 --> 4691.88]  moments of
[4691.88 --> 4692.38]  the apparent
[4692.38 --> 4693.22]  absence of
[4693.22 --> 4693.56]  God
[4693.56 --> 4694.40]  and remember
[4694.40 --> 4695.28]  who it was
[4695.28 --> 4695.94]  that cried
[4695.94 --> 4696.28]  out
[4696.28 --> 4696.86]  my God
[4696.86 --> 4697.42]  my God
[4697.42 --> 4698.22]  why have
[4698.22 --> 4698.88]  you forsaken
[4698.88 --> 4699.10]  me
[4699.10 --> 4699.72]  remember
[4699.72 --> 4700.12]  that the
[4700.12 --> 4700.60]  one who
[4700.60 --> 4701.48]  experienced
[4701.48 --> 4702.44]  God's face
[4702.44 --> 4703.50]  being turned
[4703.50 --> 4704.18]  away from
[4704.18 --> 4704.38]  him
[4704.38 --> 4705.02]  did so
[4705.02 --> 4705.44]  so that
[4705.44 --> 4705.92]  you and
[4705.92 --> 4706.22]  I
[4706.22 --> 4707.04]  would never
[4707.04 --> 4708.14]  have to
[4708.14 --> 4711.54]  in his
[4711.54 --> 4713.40]  most excellent
[4713.40 --> 4713.92]  book
[4713.92 --> 4714.98]  walking with
[4714.98 --> 4715.28]  God
[4715.28 --> 4715.86]  through pain
[4715.86 --> 4716.48]  and suffering
[4716.48 --> 4717.98]  Tim Keller
[4717.98 --> 4718.44]  writes
[4718.44 --> 4720.70]  if you go
[4720.70 --> 4721.26]  into the
[4721.26 --> 4721.56]  furnace
[4721.56 --> 4722.16]  without the
[4722.16 --> 4722.56]  gospel
[4722.56 --> 4724.00]  it will not
[4724.00 --> 4724.64]  be possible
[4724.64 --> 4725.22]  to find
[4725.22 --> 4725.84]  God there
[4725.84 --> 4727.50]  you will be
[4727.50 --> 4728.14]  sure he
[4728.14 --> 4728.62]  has done
[4728.62 --> 4729.08]  a terrible
[4729.08 --> 4729.48]  wrong
[4729.48 --> 4730.32]  or you
[4730.32 --> 4730.72]  have
[4730.72 --> 4731.22]  and you
[4731.22 --> 4731.66]  will feel
[4731.66 --> 4732.12]  alone
[4732.12 --> 4733.02]  you will
[4733.02 --> 4733.50]  be mad
[4733.50 --> 4733.98]  at God
[4733.98 --> 4734.40]  or mad
[4734.40 --> 4734.94]  at yourself
[4734.94 --> 4735.86]  or mad
[4735.86 --> 4736.74]  at both
[4736.74 --> 4738.90]  but
[4738.90 --> 4740.92]  if you
[4740.92 --> 4741.60]  go into
[4741.60 --> 4742.26]  the furnace
[4742.26 --> 4742.88]  with
[4742.88 --> 4743.96]  the gospel
[4743.96 --> 4745.22]  you will
[4745.22 --> 4745.88]  find
[4745.88 --> 4746.84]  a God
[4746.84 --> 4747.10]  who
[4747.10 --> 4747.76]  entered
[4747.76 --> 4748.74]  the furnace
[4748.74 --> 4749.62]  for you
[4749.62 --> 4750.38]  you will
[4750.38 --> 4750.80]  find
[4750.80 --> 4751.26]  Jesus
[4751.26 --> 4752.04]  who knows
[4752.04 --> 4752.74]  your hurt
[4752.74 --> 4753.66]  because he
[4753.66 --> 4754.26]  endured
[4754.26 --> 4754.88]  the same
[4754.88 --> 4755.88]  you will
[4755.88 --> 4756.66]  find a God
[4756.66 --> 4757.28]  who is big
[4757.28 --> 4757.60]  enough
[4757.60 --> 4758.50]  to handle
[4758.50 --> 4759.12]  your anger
[4759.12 --> 4760.22]  and a God
[4760.22 --> 4760.80]  who is big
[4760.80 --> 4761.08]  enough

[4761.70 --> 4762.32]  reasons
[4762.32 --> 4763.16]  for your
[4763.16 --> 4763.90]  experience
[4763.90 --> 4764.34]  that you
[4764.34 --> 4764.84]  might not
[4764.84 --> 4765.18]  be able
[4765.18 --> 4765.76]  to comprehend
[4765.76 --> 4766.96]  or understand
[4766.96 --> 4767.52]  you will
[4767.52 --> 4768.24]  find a God
[4768.24 --> 4768.82]  who has
[4768.82 --> 4769.66]  been good
[4769.66 --> 4770.12]  to you
[4770.12 --> 4770.66]  and so
[4770.66 --> 4771.36]  you can
[4771.36 --> 4771.80]  walk
[4771.80 --> 4772.30]  forward
[4772.30 --> 4773.22]  with him
[4773.22 --> 4776.22]  turning
[4776.22 --> 4776.88]  your anger
[4776.88 --> 4777.38]  into
[4777.38 --> 4778.34]  prayer
[4778.34 --> 4779.00]  is an
[4779.00 --> 4779.58]  act of
[4779.58 --> 4780.10]  faith
[4780.10 --> 4780.96]  towards
[4780.96 --> 4781.44]  the one
[4781.44 --> 4781.90]  and in
[4781.90 --> 4782.32]  the one
[4782.32 --> 4783.06]  the only
[4783.06 --> 4783.38]  one
[4783.38 --> 4783.74]  who can
[4783.74 --> 4783.94]  do
[4783.94 --> 4784.38]  something
[4784.38 --> 4785.08]  about
[4785.08 --> 4785.38]  it
[4785.38 --> 4788.04]  and so
[4788.04 --> 4789.54]  maybe you
[4789.54 --> 4789.88]  can't
[4789.88 --> 4790.20]  sing
[4790.20 --> 4790.64]  today
[4790.64 --> 4794.90]  maybe
[4794.90 --> 4795.18]  today
[4795.18 --> 4795.54]  is not
[4795.54 --> 4795.96]  that day

[4796.42 --> 4799.50]  but you
[4799.50 --> 4799.98]  will sing
[4799.98 --> 4800.34]  again
[4800.34 --> 4802.08]  on the
[4802.08 --> 4802.56]  confidence
[4802.56 --> 4803.16]  of the
[4803.16 --> 4803.58]  gospel
[4803.58 --> 4804.20]  of Jesus
[4804.20 --> 4804.82]  Christ
[4804.82 --> 4805.74]  I can
[4805.74 --> 4806.10]  say
[4806.10 --> 4806.88]  you will
[4806.88 --> 4807.60]  sing
[4807.60 --> 4808.38]  again
[4808.38 --> 4810.66]  we can't
[4810.66 --> 4810.96]  skip
[4810.96 --> 4811.58]  the cross
[4811.58 --> 4814.12]  but if
[4814.12 --> 4814.42]  you look
[4814.42 --> 4814.66]  at the
[4814.66 --> 4814.94]  cross
[4814.94 --> 4815.36]  today
[4815.36 --> 4816.50]  you will
[4816.50 --> 4816.84]  see that
[4816.84 --> 4817.02]  it's
[4817.02 --> 4817.30]  empty
[4817.30 --> 4819.54]  and you
[4819.54 --> 4819.86]  will see
[4819.86 --> 4820.14]  that the
[4820.14 --> 4820.50]  tomb
[4820.50 --> 4820.84]  that they

[4821.24 --> 4821.84]  body in
[4821.84 --> 4822.96]  is also
[4822.96 --> 4823.96]  empty
[4823.96 --> 4826.60]  and maybe
[4826.60 --> 4827.24]  not today
[4827.24 --> 4829.34]  maybe not
[4829.34 --> 4829.82]  tomorrow
[4829.82 --> 4831.50]  but one
