[211.00 → 216.00] It's like a picture that you've painted for me
[216.00 → 221.28] A love letter in the sky
[221.28 → 227.00] Story
[227.00 → 232.78] I could have had a really different story
[232.78 → 239.00] But you came down from heaven to restore me
[239.00 → 244.50] Forever saved my life
[244.50 → 253.66] Nobody loves me like you love me, Jesus
[253.66 → 259.66] I stand in all of your amazing ways
[259.66 → 265.16] I worship you as long as I am breathing
[265.16 → 268.76] God, you are faithful and true
[268.76 → 272.26] Nobody loves me like you
[272.26 → 278.26] Mountains
[278.26 → 284.76] You're breaking down the weight of all my mountains
[284.76 → 290.26] Even when it feels like I'm surrounded
[290.26 → 296.26] You never leave my side
[296.26 → 305.76] Nobody loves me like you love me, Jesus
[305.76 → 311.26] I stand in all of your amazing ways
[311.26 → 317.26] I worship you as long as I am breathing
[317.26 → 320.26] God, you are faithful and true

[346.26 → 347.26] Not going to chaos
[347.26 → 349.26] Oh, what a song to sing.
[351.26 → 353.26] Oh, what a song.
[354.26 → 356.26] My heart keeps singing.

[362.26 → 366.26] Oh, what a song to sing.
[367.26 → 368.26] I'll never stop.
[369.26 → 371.26] Oh, what a song to sing.
[372.26 → 375.26] Jesus, you love me.
[375.26 → 378.26] And I love you, God.
[380.26 → 384.26] Nobody loves me like you love me.
[384.26 → 391.26] Jesus, I stand in awe of your amazing way.
[392.26 → 397.26] I'll worship you as long as I am relieved.
[398.26 → 401.26] God, I will worship you forever.
[402.26 → 403.26] Worship me.
[403.26 → 407.26] Nobody loves me like you love me.
[408.26 → 413.26] Jesus, I stand in awe of your amazing way.
[414.26 → 420.26] I'll worship you as long as I am relieved.
[421.26 → 423.26] God, you are faithful in truth.
[423.26 → 424.26] Nobody loves me like you.
[424.26 → 426.26] Nobody loves me like you love me.
[426.26 → 428.26] Nobody loves me like you love me.
[428.26 → 432.26] I'm a child of God.
[432.26 → 433.26] I'm a child of God.
[433.26 → 434.26] I'm a child of God.
[434.26 → 437.26] Yes, I am.
[437.26 → 440.26] Nobody loves me like you love me.
[440.26 → 441.26] Nobody loves me like you.
[441.26 → 445.26] Nobody loves me like you.
[445.26 → 475.24] I love you
[475.26 → 505.24] I love you
[505.26 → 535.24] I love you
[535.24 → 537.24] We sing to the God who heals
[537.24 → 540.08] We sing to the God who saves
[540.08 → 544.52] We sing to the God who always makes a way
[544.52 → 548.42] Because He hung up on that cross
[548.42 → 551.30] Then He rose up from that grave
[551.30 → 556.40] My God's still Rolling Stones away
[556.40 → 561.40] Let's join the heart of the Lord
[561.40 → 565.72] Good morning everyone
[565.72 → 568.46] Welcome to church this morning
[568.46 → 569.54] My name is Kevin Robert
[569.54 → 571.34] I'm the youth pastor here at Emanuel
[571.34 → 574.18] It's good to see so many of us here on this August Sunday
[574.18 → 577.18] A couple of announcements this morning before we begin the service
[577.18 → 580.78] This coming Thursday, August the 25th
[580.78 → 582.70] Our church is hosting a town hall meeting
[582.70 → 586.14] So that's for all members and even non-members to invite
[586.14 → 588.42] To come out to discuss things of this church
[588.42 → 591.08] But specifically the young adult ministry of our church
[591.08 → 595.12] So the past two years the young adult ministry was under
[595.12 → 597.78] Josh Chamberlain was the intern here
[597.78 → 598.58] He ran that ministry
[598.58 → 599.74] His contract has been up
[599.74 → 600.92] And so there's a meeting to discuss
[600.92 → 602.84] What do we do with this ministry going forward
[602.84 → 605.24] Council's got a proposal
[605.24 → 608.60] But we want to give some information and some reasons for that proposal
[608.60 → 610.38] And then we want to hear from you the congregation as well
[610.38 → 612.50] So please do come out this coming Thursday
[612.50 → 615.10] I believe it starts at 7 for that discussion
[615.10 → 617.38] And we hope to see many of you there for that
[617.38 → 619.42] On September the 4th
[619.42 → 620.86] Which is in a couple of weeks
[620.86 → 626.62] We're going to be hosting a baseball tournament barbecue fun event
[626.62 → 628.40] So that'll happen after church
[628.40 → 630.62] 12 till 4-ish we're thinking
[630.62 → 632.42] A few more details are being sorted
[632.42 → 634.46] But have that date sort of circled in your calendar
[634.46 → 636.18] If you'd like to come to that
[636.18 → 637.64] Sign up for a baseball team
[637.64 → 638.74] Email Aaron
[638.74 → 639.62] His name is
[639.62 → 642.64] His email's in the bulletin as well
[642.64 → 643.46] So you can email him
[643.46 → 644.68] And he'll get you on a team
[644.68 → 646.02] And then we'll have a good time
[646.02 → 646.94] So if you want to play
[646.94 → 647.22] Play
[647.22 → 648.00] If you don't want to play
[648.00 → 648.72] You can still come out
[648.72 → 649.68] And you can watch
[649.68 → 650.42] And you can eat food
[650.42 → 651.62] And you can cheer people on
[651.62 → 652.36] And it'll be very exciting
[652.36 → 654.36] Finally reactivate
[654.36 → 655.52] Is a big youth conference
[655.52 → 656.84] Done in the CRC church
[656.84 → 659.14] The 7th one is happening
[659.14 → 661.78] This September 9th to 11th
[661.78 → 662.32] Youth
[662.32 → 663.48] You can still register
[663.48 → 664.22] Till the end of the month
[664.22 → 665.16] So please do that
[665.16 → 666.38] But for that conference
[666.38 → 668.48] It's being hosted by Willoughby
[668.48 → 670.54] But we're looking for a number of volunteers still
[670.54 → 672.94] So some more information
[672.94 → 674.04] On what type of volunteer
[674.04 → 675.62] Will be coming out in the next week or two
[675.62 → 677.58] But we're especially looking for someone
[677.58 → 678.56] To help out in the kitchen
[678.56 → 680.50] We have a wonderful leader
[680.50 → 681.70] Who's cooking all the meals
[681.70 → 683.30] And does most of the grocery shopping
[683.30 → 683.64] Fay
[683.64 → 685.86] But she's looking for sort of right-hand person
[685.86 → 687.98] To kind of walk alongside of her that weekend
[687.98 → 689.48] So if that's something that you're passionate about
[689.48 → 690.60] Something you think you can help with
[690.60 → 693.04] Please consider coming out to that
[693.04 → 693.92] You can chat with me
[693.92 → 696.30] To help out in that capacity
[696.30 → 699.30] I'm going to invite you all to rise right now
[699.30 → 701.30] And we'll receive God's greeting this morning
[701.30 → 706.18] God's greeting this morning
[706.18 → 708.10] Comes from Revelation 1
[708.10 → 708.86] Where it says
[708.86 → 710.90] Grace to you and peace from him
[710.90 → 713.42] Who is and who was and who is to come
[713.42 → 716.14] And from the seven spirits before his throne
[716.14 → 717.64] And from Jesus Christ
[717.64 → 718.94] Who is the faithful witness
[718.94 → 720.52] The firstborn of the dead
[720.52 → 722.94] And the ruler of the kings of the earth
[722.94 → 724.48] And all God's people said
[724.48 → 727.62] Now we haven't done this in a long time
[727.62 → 729.28] But as God has greeted us this morning
[729.28 → 731.72] Please be sensitive to maybe some handshakes for some
[731.72 → 732.66] But please take this time
[732.66 → 733.20] Turn around
[733.20 → 735.26] Greet one another this morning
[735.26 → 735.76] Amen
[748.94 → 761.88] Children of God
[761.88 → 764.06] Enter into this congregation
[764.06 → 765.78] Not just with your physical being
[765.78 → 767.68] Let not your heart and mind
[767.68 → 769.36] Be misplaced in its affections
[769.36 → 771.60] Humble yourselves before the presence
[771.60 → 772.78] Of the almighty God
[772.78 → 774.08] The everlasting Lord
[774.08 → 774.98] The truth
[774.98 → 775.96] The great I am
[775.96 → 776.90] The Lord of Jehovah
[776.90 → 778.10] Creator of the earth
[778.10 → 780.52] Let us come bow down before him
[780.52 → 782.22] Bring your praises
[782.22 → 782.90] Your cries
[782.90 → 783.50] Your prayers
[783.50 → 784.12] You're wrestling
[784.12 → 785.76] Come with expectation
[785.76 → 786.54] With faith
[786.54 → 787.40] Before our Father
[787.40 → 788.24] Who art in heaven
[788.24 → 789.48] Bride of Christ
[789.48 → 790.36] Lift your voices
[790.36 → 791.00] And sing

[817.08 → 822.48] In the faith he will provide
[822.48 → 828.88] Let us come in true submission
[828.88 → 834.56] In the faith he will provide
[834.56 → 837.98] Let us come to God
[837.98 → 838.94] Let us come to God
[838.94 → 840.98] To save you
[840.98 → 846.22] He has his arms stretched open wide
[846.22 → 849.86] He died at Calvary
[849.86 → 852.84] Just to save you
[852.84 → 853.84] Because he loves you
[853.84 → 855.04] Because he loves you
[855.04 → 855.06] Because he loves you
[855.06 → 856.76] As his child
[856.76 → 864.34] He is the everlasting Lord
[864.34 → 867.26] He is the truth
[867.26 → 869.66] The great I am

[871.50 → 875.16] Creator of the earth
[875.16 → 879.58] Come let us bow before him now
[879.58 → 892.50] He has called you to your Father
[892.50 → 898.00] He has called you as his child
[898.00 → 902.42] Joined as with Christ
[902.42 → 905.50] Oh righteous saint
[905.50 → 910.42] He has made you holy in his sight
[910.42 → 916.84] He is the everlasting Lord
[916.84 → 919.84] He is the truth

[1046.82 → 1050.70] Send and sing to broken hearts
[1050.70 → 1054.52] Who can know the healing power

[1076.96 → 1080.58] We've been through fire
[1080.58 → 1082.66] We've been through rain
[1082.66 → 1086.54] We've been refined by the power of His name
[1086.54 → 1090.40] We've fallen deeper in love with you
[1090.40 → 1096.40] You've burned the truth on our lips
[1096.40 → 1100.40] Shout to the north and the south
[1100.40 → 1104.38] Sing to the east and the west
[1104.38 → 1108.46] Jesus, his Saviour to all
[1108.46 → 1112.40] He's Lord of heaven and earth
[1112.40 → 1117.78] Rise up, church with broken wings
[1117.78 → 1121.58] Fill this place with songs again
[1121.58 → 1125.68] Of our God who reigns on heart
[1125.68 → 1130.28] By His grace again we'll fly
[1130.28 → 1136.02] Shout to the north and the south
[1136.02 → 1140.02] Sing to the east and the west
[1140.02 → 1144.16] Jesus, his Saviour to all
[1144.16 → 1147.74] He's Lord of heaven and earth
[1147.74 → 1151.96] Shout to the north and the south
[1151.96 → 1155.74] Sing to the east and the west
[1155.74 → 1159.78] Jesus, his Saviour to all
[1159.78 → 1163.70] He's Lord of heaven and earth
[1163.70 → 1176.16] Hear our prayer, O Lord
[1176.16 → 1179.12] Let my cries come to you
[1179.12 → 1181.34] Do not hide your face from me
[1181.34 → 1182.78] In the day of my distress
[1182.78 → 1184.62] Incline your ear to me
[1184.62 → 1187.54] Answer me speedily in the day when I call
[1187.54 → 1190.44] For my days pass away like smoke
[1190.44 → 1192.86] And my bones burn like a furnace
[1192.86 → 1195.78] My heart is struck down like grass
[1195.78 → 1196.64] And has withered
[1196.64 → 1198.56] I forgot to eat my bread
[1198.56 → 1200.58] Because of my loud groaning
[1200.58 → 1202.68] My bones cling to my flesh
[1202.68 → 1205.74] I'm like a desert owl of the wilderness
[1205.74 → 1208.18] Like an owl of the waste places
[1208.18 → 1209.38] I lie awake
[1209.38 → 1213.00] I am like a lonely sparrow on the housetop
[1213.00 → 1216.34] All the day my enemies taunt me
[1216.34 → 1219.12] Those who deride me
[1219.12 → 1221.30] Use my name for a curse
[1221.30 → 1223.48] For I eat ashes like bread
[1223.48 → 1225.40] And mingle tears with my drink
[1225.40 → 1229.20] Because of your indignation and anger
[1229.20 → 1232.36] For you have taken me up
[1232.36 → 1233.60] And thrown me down
[1233.60 → 1235.84] My days are like an evening shadow
[1235.84 → 1238.54] I wither away like grass
[1238.54 → 1242.46] But you, O Lord, are enthroned forever
[1242.46 → 1245.40] You are remembered throughout all the generations
[1245.40 → 1248.14] You will arise and have pity on Zion
[1248.14 → 1250.20] It is the time to favour her
[1250.20 → 1251.92] The appointed time has come
[1251.92 → 1254.52] For your servants hold her stones dear
[1254.52 → 1256.00] And have pity on her dust
[1256.00 → 1258.34] Nations will fear the name of the Lord
[1258.34 → 1261.26] And all the kings of the earth will fear your glory
[1261.26 → 1263.22] For the Lord builds up Zion
[1263.22 → 1264.86] He appears in his glory
[1264.86 → 1267.52] He regards the prayer of the destitute
[1267.52 → 1270.04] And he does not despise their prayers
[1270.04 → 1270.88] Under his alrededor
[1270.88 → 1294.90] And all the
[1294.90 → 1309.60] O Lord, hear
[1309.60 → 1316.20] O Lord, forgive us
[1316.20 → 1322.90] We have lost the awe of you
[1322.90 → 1330.90] Have mercy, have mercy
[1330.90 → 1339.10] O Lord, cleanse
[1339.10 → 1344.98] Our hearts which are divided
[1344.98 → 1352.88] Stir the faith that we once knew
[1352.88 → 1359.88] We're thirsty, we're thirsty
[1359.88 → 1366.88] O Lord, restore
[1366.88 → 1374.88] The church that bears your name
[1374.88 → 1382.88] O Spirit send
[1382.88 → 1389.88] A revival to this nation
[1389.88 → 1396.88] Breathe on us again
[1396.88 → 1403.88] Breathe on us again
[1403.88 → 1413.88] O Lord, hear
[1413.88 → 1420.88] O Lord, forgive us
[1420.88 → 1428.88] We have lost the awe of you
[1428.88 → 1435.88] Have mercy, have mercy
[1435.88 → 1445.88] O Lord, cleanse
[1445.88 → 1449.88] Our hearts which are divided
[1449.88 → 1457.88] Stir the faith that we once knew
[1457.88 → 1464.88] We're thirsty, we're thirsty
[1464.88 → 1465.88] We're thirsty
[1465.88 → 1471.88] O Lord, restore
[1471.88 → 1479.88] The church that bears your name
[1479.88 → 1486.88] O Spirit send
[1486.88 → 1487.88] O Spirit send
[1487.88 → 1494.88] A revival to this nation
[1494.88 → 1500.88] Breathe on us again
[1500.88 → 1501.88] Breathe on us again
[1501.88 → 1507.88] Breathe on us again
[1507.88 → 1514.88] O Lord, restore
[1514.88 → 1517.88] The church that bears your name
[1517.88 → 1521.88] The church that bears your name
[1521.88 → 1523.88] The church that bears your name
[1523.88 → 1525.88] The church that bears your name
[1525.88 → 1527.88] O Spirit send
[1527.88 → 1529.88] A revival to this nation
[1529.88 → 1531.88] Breathe on us again
[1531.88 → 1544.88] Breathe on us again
[1544.88 → 1550.88] Breathe on us again
[1550.88 → 1560.88] Breathe on us again
[1580.88 → 1597.88] We go data
[1597.88 → 1602.88] Love and
[1602.88 → 1618.62] When peace like a river attended my way,
[1618.62 → 1628.86] When sorrows like sea billows roll,
[1628.86 → 1641.72] Whatever my lot Thou hast taught me to say,
[1641.72 → 1653.10] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[1653.10 → 1662.10] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[1662.10 → 1677.10] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[1677.10 → 1689.10] Though Satan should buffet, Though trials should come,
[1689.10 → 1698.10] Let this blessed assurance control.
[1698.10 → 1712.10] That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,
[1712.10 → 1724.10] And hath shed His own blood for my soul.
[1724.10 → 1733.10] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[1733.10 → 1748.10] With my soul it is well, it is well with my soul.
[1748.10 → 1761.10] My sin, O the bliss of this glorious Lord,
[1761.10 → 1774.10] My sin, O the bliss of this world.
[1774.10 → 1779.10] It is well, it is well, it is well,
[1779.10 → 1785.10] And I bear it no more.
[1785.10 → 1797.10] Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul.
[1797.10 → 1809.10] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[1809.10 → 1824.10] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[1824.10 → 1837.10] O Lord, haste the day When my faith shall be sight,
[1837.10 → 1849.10] The clouds be rolled back as a scroll.
[1849.10 → 1859.10] The trump shall resound, And the Lord shall descend,
[1859.10 → 1864.10] Even so, it is well with my soul.
[1864.10 → 1874.10] It is well with my soul.
[1874.10 → 1879.10] It is well, it is well, with my soul.
[1879.10 → 1880.10] With my soul.
[1880.10 → 1884.10] It is well, it is well, with my soul.
[1884.10 → 1885.10] With my soul.
[1885.10 → 1890.10] It is well, it is well, with my soul.
[1890.10 → 1900.10] It is well, with my soul.
[1900.10 → 1905.10] Please be seated.
[1905.10 → 1930.10] Good morning.
[1930.10 → 1935.10] Well, that's on my top ten for hymns.
[1935.10 → 1940.10] Okay, today's offerings are for Emmanuel's ministries and missions,
[1940.10 → 1947.10] And the special offering is for World Renew, refugee sponsorship and resettlement.
[1947.10 → 1956.10] World Renew has been a sponsorship agreement holder with Immigration and Refugee Citizenship Canada since 1979.
[1956.10 → 1972.10] World Renew partners with churches, individuals and refugee organizations to facilitate refugee sponsorships to Canada and to advocate for refugee rights globally.
[1972.10 → 1985.10] World Renew is encouraged by the hard work of churches and communities like ours and others over the past 43 years of the program.
[1985.10 → 1993.10] In sponsoring and helping to resettle refugees, new Canadians to a new home.
[1993.10 → 1998.10] For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command.
[1998.10 → 2000.10] Love your neighbour as yourself.
[2000.10 → 2003.10] Galatians 5.14
[2003.10 → 2006.10] Leviticus 19.33-34
[2006.10 → 2012.10] For when a foreigner resides among you in your land, do not mistreat them.
[2012.10 → 2018.10] The foreigner is residing among you who must be treated as your native born.
[2018.10 → 2020.10] Love them as yourself.
[2020.10 → 2023.10] For you were foreigners in Egypt.
[2023.10 → 2025.10] I am the Lord your God.
[2025.10 → 2027.10] I am the Lord your God.
[2027.10 → 2057.08] We will feast in the house of sons.
[2057.10 → 2063.36] We will sing with the hearts restored.
[2063.62 → 2068.88] He has done great things we will say together.
[2069.44 → 2075.20] We will feast and weep no more.
[2077.90 → 2083.38] We will not be burned by the fire.
[2083.38 → 2088.86] He is the Lord our God.
[2089.22 → 2094.72] We are not consumed by the flood.
[2095.26 → 2101.38] A hell protected gathered.
[2102.40 → 2107.30] We will feast in the house of Zion.
[2107.30 → 2112.54] We will sing with the hearts restored.
[2112.88 → 2117.30] He has done great things we will say together.
[2118.30 → 2123.30] We will feast and weep no more.
[2123.30 → 2131.30] In the dark of night before the dawn.
[2132.30 → 2136.30] My soul be not afraid.
[2137.30 → 2141.30] For the promised morning, oh how long.
[2141.30 → 2149.30] Oh God of Jacob, be my strength.
[2150.30 → 2155.14] We will feast in the house of Zion.
[2155.68 → 2160.30] We will sing with our hearts restored.
[2160.64 → 2165.54] He has done great things we will say together.
[2165.54 → 2171.54] We will feast and weep no more.
[2174.54 → 2178.54] Every vow we've broken and betrayed.
[2178.54 → 2184.76] You are the faithful one.
[2184.76 → 2189.54] And from the garden to the grave.
[2189.54 → 2193.10] Bind us together.
[2193.10 → 2197.66] And from the garden to the garden to the garden.
[2197.74 → 2202.74] We will feast in the house of Zion.
[2202.88 → 2203.66] We will feast in the house of Zion.
[2203.66 → 2207.66] We will sing with our hearts restored.
[2208.08 → 2212.54] He has done great things we will say together.
[2212.54 → 2219.54] We will feast and weep no more.
[2237.98 → 2238.84] All right.
[2238.84 → 2243.14] Can we have all the kids up front for the kids' blessing?
[2263.14 → 2263.72] All right.
[2263.84 → 2266.28] I don't have much of a story for you guys today,
[2266.42 → 2267.66] but before we do the blessing,
[2267.66 → 2269.60] I kind of want to know how your summer's going.
[2271.42 → 2272.56] Your summer's going good.
[2272.62 → 2273.78] How about the rest of you guys?
[2274.56 → 2275.20] How's the summer?
[2275.38 → 2275.54] Yeah?
[2276.80 → 2277.08] Yeah?
[2278.22 → 2279.04] What would be,
[2279.22 → 2280.62] maybe you can tell me,
[2280.72 → 2281.58] a couple of you guys,
[2281.72 → 2283.50] what your highlight of the summer's been so far.
[2283.56 → 2284.30] What's been your highlight?
[2284.30 → 2284.36] What's the highlight?
[2291.36 → 2292.78] You made a garden this summer,
[2292.92 → 2294.38] and the sun's helping it grow.
[2294.48 → 2295.48] That sounds pretty cool.
[2296.82 → 2298.60] So you don't have to go to the grocery store anymore?
[2298.70 → 2300.12] You guys are just eating out of the garden?
[2300.12 → 2300.44] Yeah.
[2300.68 → 2301.14] Right on.
[2301.22 → 2301.68] That's good.
[2302.88 → 2304.12] You eat lots of carrots.
[2304.92 → 2305.28] How about you?
[2305.34 → 2306.76] What's the highlight of your summer so far?
[2306.76 → 2307.76] What's the highlight of your summer?
[2312.62 → 2314.06] Went to grandma's and went to the lake.
[2314.14 → 2314.40] Olivia,
[2314.48 → 2315.54] do you have a highlight of the summer?
[2317.78 → 2319.20] You went camping and saw turtles.
[2319.28 → 2319.92] Anybody else?
[2320.02 → 2320.46] How about you?
[2321.14 → 2322.44] What's the fun part of your summer?
[2323.24 → 2324.34] You went to the Shush off.
[2324.72 → 2325.28] Right on.
[2325.36 → 2325.88] Sounds good.
[2326.60 → 2326.80] Well,
[2326.84 → 2328.00] I'm glad you guys had a good summer,
[2328.10 → 2330.32] because summer's almost over,
[2330.54 → 2332.56] and some of you got to go back to school.
[2333.16 → 2334.12] Maybe none of you guys.
[2334.12 → 2335.46] Do any of you guys go to school yet?
[2336.34 → 2336.70] You do?
[2336.84 → 2337.24] Right on.
[2337.82 → 2338.14] All right.
[2338.20 → 2339.50] Let's stand up and do the blessing
[2339.50 → 2342.16] that the rest of the congregation can join us.
[2347.04 → 2347.40] Ready?
[2347.40 → 2347.48] Ready?
[2348.02 → 2350.76] The Lord be with you.
[2351.66 → 2352.94] And all are with you.
[2364.12 → 2385.02] Good morning.
[2385.12 → 2385.76] My name is Glenn,
[2386.00 → 2387.70] and I'm one of the elders here at Emmanuel.
[2388.32 → 2390.08] It is my privilege to lead you
[2390.08 → 2391.44] in our congregational prayer.
[2391.44 → 2393.96] So let's go to the Lord in prayer.
[2396.98 → 2397.76] Holy Father,
[2398.24 → 2399.48] we thank you for the opportunity
[2399.48 → 2401.80] to gather together as a local church family,
[2402.22 → 2403.72] and to bring our Thanksgiving,
[2404.12 → 2404.76] our joys,
[2404.86 → 2406.92] and our concerns before you in prayer.
[2407.84 → 2408.94] Thank you for the assurance
[2408.94 → 2410.64] that you hear all our prayers,
[2411.18 → 2413.50] both individual prayers and corporate prayers,
[2413.78 → 2416.62] and strengthen us to develop the discipline
[2416.62 → 2418.12] to pray continually.
[2418.12 → 2421.96] We give you thanks for all that you have done
[2421.96 → 2423.12] for us in Christ Jesus,
[2423.66 → 2426.74] and for the presence of the Holy Spirit in our lives,
[2427.24 → 2428.64] making us a new creation,
[2429.80 → 2431.38] making us alive in Christ.
[2431.38 → 2434.64] We ask that your Spirit will enable us
[2434.64 → 2436.90] to reflect the glory and the light of Christ
[2436.90 → 2438.28] in a dark world.
[2439.76 → 2441.16] We pray for your blessing
[2441.16 → 2442.74] in the ministries of this church.
[2443.74 → 2446.02] We ask that these ministries will be effective
[2446.02 → 2447.82] in bringing people to Christ
[2447.82 → 2451.36] and in deepening our members' relationship with Christ.
[2451.36 → 2454.66] Grant the leadership of this church wisdom
[2454.66 → 2456.92] to discern your will for this church
[2456.92 → 2459.28] and the courage to follow your leading.
[2460.50 → 2461.20] Later this week,
[2461.24 → 2462.70] we will meet to discuss and consider
[2462.70 → 2464.56] how to minister to the young adults
[2464.56 → 2465.78] in our church family.
[2466.48 → 2469.04] We ask for your blessing on this ministry,
[2469.72 → 2471.12] that it will effectively reach
[2471.12 → 2474.22] and engage the young adults in our community.
[2474.22 → 2478.08] We thank you for all the staff
[2478.08 → 2480.20] and volunteers of this church family
[2480.20 → 2482.34] and their willingness to serve.
[2483.34 → 2485.74] We ask that they experience your joy
[2485.74 → 2487.02] as they serve
[2487.02 → 2489.30] and grant them wisdom and strength
[2489.30 → 2491.44] when they must deal with difficult situations.
[2492.82 → 2495.46] Help our church to reflect your kingdom coming
[2495.46 → 2496.76] here on earth.
[2496.76 → 2499.72] We ask for your blessing
[2499.72 → 2502.12] on Rachel Klingeltink and Kyle Thomas
[2502.12 → 2504.48] as they prepare to be married later this week.
[2505.32 → 2506.38] We ask that the wedding
[2506.38 → 2508.16] will be a wonderful time of celebration.
[2509.30 → 2511.40] We also ask that you go with them
[2511.40 → 2513.38] as they begin their lives together.
[2516.52 → 2518.56] We pray for the leaders who govern us,
[2519.18 → 2521.82] the national, provincial, and municipal levels.
[2522.98 → 2524.64] Their authority has been given by you.
[2524.64 → 2526.78] Help them look to you
[2526.78 → 2528.48] for guidance and direction.
[2529.72 → 2531.94] Enable them to govern with hearts of service
[2531.94 → 2533.36] for their constituents.
[2537.18 → 2539.42] We continue to ask that you be with those
[2539.42 → 2541.54] who are affected by war and violence
[2541.54 → 2542.56] throughout the world.
[2543.48 → 2546.06] Comfort those who mourn the loss of loved ones.
[2547.16 → 2548.80] Watch over and provide for those
[2548.80 → 2549.96] who have been displaced
[2549.96 → 2551.64] because of war and violence.
[2551.64 → 2555.12] Grant wisdom to governments and leaders
[2555.12 → 2557.14] who can be agents of peace
[2557.14 → 2558.90] in war-torn areas.
[2560.40 → 2561.76] Change the hearts of those
[2561.76 → 2566.20] who perpetrate violence and war
[2566.20 → 2568.62] for their own selfish ambitions.
[2569.66 → 2571.82] We pray for peace in Ukraine
[2571.82 → 2574.90] and wherever war and violence are occurring.
[2574.90 → 2579.00] We continue to ask for your blessing
[2579.00 → 2580.38] on the members of this church
[2580.38 → 2581.24] who are on vacation.
[2582.14 → 2583.88] We ask that they experience refreshment
[2583.88 → 2585.80] and renewal as they take a break
[2585.80 → 2586.92] from regular work.
[2588.14 → 2589.58] Watch over them as they travel.
[2591.58 → 2593.10] We thank you for your word
[2593.10 → 2595.50] which is truly a lamp unto our feet
[2595.50 → 2597.14] and a light for our path.
[2598.28 → 2599.14] Bless Pastor Kevin
[2599.14 → 2601.64] as he expands on your word this morning
[2601.64 → 2604.72] so that its truth will reside deeply
[2604.72 → 2605.88] in our hearts.
[2607.04 → 2608.50] And as we enter a new week
[2608.50 → 2611.04] equip us to honour and glorify you
[2611.04 → 2612.22] in all we do and say
[2612.22 → 2614.34] and keep us from sin.
[2615.18 → 2616.64] Hear our prayer, O Lord.
[2617.28 → 2617.56] Amen.
[2631.64 → 2643.08] There's a famous man,
[2643.48 → 2644.94] a historian, a philosopher,
[2645.12 → 2646.50] a writer from the first century
[2646.50 → 2647.94] by the name of Plutarch.
[2648.52 → 2650.04] Maybe some of you have heard of him before.
[2650.38 → 2651.86] I'm not really a historian myself
[2651.86 → 2652.78] but I had heard of him
[2652.78 → 2654.28] so he's got to be kind of a big deal.
[2655.14 → 2656.26] Anyway, in one of his writings
[2656.26 → 2658.78] titled Sayings of Kings and Commanders
[2658.78 → 2660.78] he recounts this true story
[2660.78 → 2664.40] which happened to King Philip II of Macedon.
[2664.46 → 2665.38] Now King Philip II,
[2665.50 → 2666.72] he was a very important king
[2666.72 → 2668.16] who ruled Macedonia
[2668.16 → 2671.10] from 359 to 336 BC.
[2671.66 → 2673.88] And early on in King Philip II's reign
[2673.88 → 2675.88] there was a woman in his kingdom
[2675.88 → 2678.48] who came upon some really hard times.
[2679.06 → 2680.74] Her husband had suddenly died
[2680.74 → 2681.54] quite young
[2681.54 → 2684.16] and she was left with no one in her life
[2684.16 → 2685.08] to care for her.
[2685.68 → 2686.56] On top of that,
[2686.64 → 2687.56] when she was attending
[2687.56 → 2689.20] to her husband's funeral,
[2689.20 → 2690.82] everything she had
[2690.82 → 2691.74] was stolen from her,
[2691.82 → 2692.60] all her flocks
[2692.60 → 2693.52] and her possessions
[2693.52 → 2695.58] and she was left with nothing.
[2696.52 → 2697.64] Nothing and no one.
[2697.76 → 2699.14] So she went to see
[2699.14 → 2700.16] King Philip II
[2700.16 → 2701.08] to seek justice
[2701.08 → 2702.08] and to seek some help.
[2703.44 → 2704.58] But she was turned away.
[2705.22 → 2706.54] So she went back the next day
[2706.54 → 2707.04] and again
[2707.04 → 2709.10] the guards turned her away.
[2709.26 → 2710.72] Every day she went back
[2710.72 → 2711.56] and every day
[2711.56 → 2713.02] she was turned away
[2713.02 → 2714.04] along with many others.
[2714.78 → 2715.28] Now one day
[2715.28 → 2716.08] when she approached
[2716.08 → 2717.22] the palace
[2717.22 → 2717.78] or wherever
[2717.78 → 2718.52] the king happened
[2718.52 → 2719.36] to be nearby
[2719.36 → 2720.28] within earshot
[2720.28 → 2721.36] and so she shouted out
[2721.36 → 2722.36] let my troubles
[2722.36 → 2723.78] be heard by you my king.
[2724.48 → 2724.84] And the king
[2724.84 → 2725.82] kind of was startled
[2725.82 → 2726.72] and paused
[2726.72 → 2727.16] and looked at her
[2727.16 → 2727.40] and said
[2727.40 → 2728.42] I have no time
[2728.42 → 2729.28] to spare you.
[2730.38 → 2731.02] Well immediately
[2731.02 → 2732.10] and without flinching
[2732.10 → 2732.58] she shouted
[2732.58 → 2733.50] well then give up
[2733.50 → 2734.18] being king.
[2736.02 → 2737.10] Well Philip II
[2737.10 → 2739.78] was taken aback by that.
[2739.98 → 2740.72] He was quite amazed
[2740.72 → 2741.68] by her boldness
[2741.68 → 2743.86] and he sent everyone away
[2743.86 → 2746.02] and listened to her at once.
[2746.60 → 2747.48] He proceeded not only
[2747.48 → 2748.50] to listen to her case
[2748.50 → 2750.18] but also all the others
[2750.18 → 2750.86] who were around
[2750.86 → 2751.36] and waiting
[2751.36 → 2752.96] and provided her justice.
[2753.10 → 2754.06] Now King Philip II
[2754.06 → 2755.74] he took this nation
[2755.74 → 2757.48] whom he apparently cared for
[2757.48 → 2758.40] and he conquered Greece
[2758.40 → 2759.44] and he became the father
[2759.44 → 2761.04] of Alexander the Great
[2761.04 → 2762.62] who I'm sure most of us know
[2762.62 → 2763.52] who ended up conquering
[2763.52 → 2764.68] most of the known world
[2764.68 → 2765.86] in the decades to follow
[2765.86 → 2766.70] and thus ends
[2766.70 → 2767.54] today's history lesson.
[2767.92 → 2769.02] This story though
[2769.02 → 2771.14] which is documented
[2771.14 → 2772.58] in many places
[2772.58 → 2773.58] in historical literature
[2773.58 → 2775.12] is a very similar story
[2775.12 → 2775.56] to the one
[2775.56 → 2775.98] that we're going
[2775.98 → 2776.90] to look at today
[2776.90 → 2777.60] the parable
[2777.60 → 2779.88] of the persistent widow.
[2780.12 → 2780.58] Now we're going to look
[2780.58 → 2781.62] at that text today
[2781.62 → 2782.66] and we're going to
[2782.66 → 2783.34] as we continue
[2783.34 → 2784.48] sort of this sermon series
[2784.48 → 2785.34] we've been working on
[2785.34 → 2786.10] on the parables.
[2786.74 → 2787.56] This story it's found
[2787.56 → 2788.64] in Luke chapter 18
[2788.64 → 2789.96] so if you have your Bibles
[2789.96 → 2790.98] or your phone apps
[2790.98 → 2791.32] or whatever
[2791.32 → 2792.80] please open it up.
[2793.02 → 2793.92] Luke chapter 18
[2793.92 → 2794.92] verses 1 to 8
[2794.92 → 2795.56] we're going to be
[2795.56 → 2796.22] going back to it
[2796.22 → 2796.96] so I do encourage you
[2796.96 → 2797.58] to have that open
[2797.58 → 2799.14] with you today.
[2800.02 → 2801.06] So Luke 18
[2801.06 → 2801.66] 1 to 8
[2801.66 → 2802.22] this morning
[2802.22 → 2803.00] says this
[2803.00 → 2803.56] we read
[2803.56 → 2805.38] Then Jesus
[2805.38 → 2806.70] told his disciples
[2806.70 → 2807.32] a parable
[2807.32 → 2808.08] to show them
[2808.08 → 2808.56] that they should
[2808.56 → 2809.44] always pray
[2809.44 → 2810.60] and not give up.
[2811.34 → 2811.70] He said
[2811.70 → 2812.68] in a certain town
[2812.68 → 2813.62] there was a judge
[2813.62 → 2815.00] who neither feared God
[2815.00 → 2815.60] nor cared
[2815.60 → 2816.92] what people thought
[2816.92 → 2818.46] and there was a widow
[2818.46 → 2819.38] in that town
[2819.38 → 2820.54] who kept coming to him
[2820.54 → 2821.10] with the plea
[2821.10 → 2822.60] grant me justice
[2822.60 → 2824.30] against my adversary.
[2825.44 → 2826.12] For some time
[2826.12 → 2826.72] he refused
[2826.72 → 2827.40] but finally
[2827.40 → 2828.16] he said to himself
[2828.16 → 2828.68] even though
[2828.68 → 2829.50] I don't fear God
[2829.50 → 2830.86] or care what people think
[2830.86 → 2832.46] yet because this widow
[2832.46 → 2833.70] keeps bothering me
[2833.70 → 2835.76] I will see that she gets justice
[2835.76 → 2837.44] so that she won't
[2837.44 → 2838.30] eventually come
[2838.30 → 2839.54] and attack me.
[2841.04 → 2842.20] And the Lord said
[2842.20 → 2843.18] listen to what
[2843.18 → 2845.26] the unjust judge says
[2845.26 → 2846.96] and will not God
[2846.96 → 2847.88] bring about justice
[2847.88 → 2848.84] for his chosen ones
[2848.84 → 2850.08] who cry out to him
[2850.08 → 2850.72] day and night?
[2851.02 → 2851.58] Will he keep
[2851.58 → 2852.50] putting them off?
[2853.50 → 2854.02] I tell you
[2854.02 → 2854.82] he will see that
[2854.82 → 2855.62] they get justice
[2855.62 → 2856.26] and quickly.
[2857.54 → 2857.84] However
[2857.84 → 2859.22] when the Son of Man
[2859.22 → 2859.90] comes
[2859.90 → 2862.04] will he find faith
[2862.04 → 2863.28] on the earth?
[2864.94 → 2866.12] The word of the Lord.
[2868.42 → 2869.52] Now in some ways
[2869.52 → 2870.08] this parable
[2870.08 → 2870.60] might seem
[2870.60 → 2871.68] fairly straightforward.
[2871.90 → 2872.34] Luke even
[2872.34 → 2873.70] introduces it
[2873.70 → 2874.32] for us
[2874.32 → 2874.86] telling us
[2874.86 → 2875.50] that it's a parable
[2875.50 → 2876.96] about praying
[2876.96 → 2878.18] and about not giving up.
[2878.86 → 2879.80] It seems like
[2879.80 → 2880.94] on a quick surface read
[2880.94 → 2881.46] this is an
[2881.46 → 2882.80] ask, and you shall receive
[2882.80 → 2883.56] type of thing.
[2883.56 → 2885.52] Think about it.
[2885.62 → 2887.14] It can't really be that.
[2887.18 → 2887.84] Is that what Jesus
[2887.84 → 2888.42] is saying?
[2889.12 → 2890.24] If we ask for something
[2890.24 → 2891.34] enough we'll just get it?
[2892.68 → 2894.02] That just doesn't seem right.
[2894.08 → 2895.34] That doesn't seem true.
[2895.82 → 2896.56] It doesn't seem
[2896.56 → 2897.62] historically accurate
[2897.62 → 2898.22] in my life.
[2898.34 → 2899.04] Perhaps it doesn't seem
[2899.04 → 2900.20] historically accurate
[2900.20 → 2900.96] in your life.
[2901.18 → 2902.22] I'm going to illustrate this.
[2902.28 → 2903.28] Are there any kids left?
[2903.50 → 2904.18] And if there's not
[2904.18 → 2905.68] are there any older kids left?
[2905.88 → 2906.58] I've got candy.
[2906.66 → 2907.06] You're going to want
[2907.06 → 2907.44] to come up.
[2907.80 → 2908.78] So kids come up front here.
[2908.84 → 2909.56] Stand in front here.
[2909.60 → 2910.86] I want to illustrate
[2910.86 → 2912.10] this point for a second.
[2912.74 → 2913.14] Here see?
[2913.36 → 2913.64] Candy.
[2913.76 → 2914.68] It's in this jar.
[2914.80 → 2915.28] If you come up
[2915.28 → 2915.70] you get some.
[2915.76 → 2916.32] That's a bribe.
[2916.96 → 2917.24] Ready?
[2918.00 → 2918.72] Yeah here we go.
[2918.78 → 2919.14] Here we go.
[2919.50 → 2920.18] This is going to be good.
[2920.98 → 2921.96] I'm going to sit right here.
[2922.80 → 2923.60] You don't have to come
[2923.60 → 2924.40] on stage or anything
[2924.40 → 2925.22] but I have a question
[2925.22 → 2925.66] for you.
[2926.30 → 2927.02] Let's pretend
[2927.02 → 2928.00] and remember
[2928.00 → 2929.44] this is very much
[2929.44 → 2930.12] only pretend.
[2930.56 → 2931.10] Let's pretend
[2931.10 → 2932.56] I'm one of your parents
[2932.56 → 2933.50] and you know
[2933.50 → 2934.38] that I've got candy
[2934.38 → 2935.14] in this jar
[2935.14 → 2936.08] and let's say
[2936.08 → 2937.02] that you want some.
[2937.22 → 2937.90] What would you do?
[2937.90 → 2940.82] Yeah you would ask
[2940.82 → 2941.28] can I have some
[2941.28 → 2941.66] and I would say
[2941.66 → 2942.42] yeah sure here you go.
[2943.32 → 2944.14] You want one too?
[2945.02 → 2945.96] You don't like candy?
[2946.04 → 2946.42] That's okay.
[2946.74 → 2947.70] I'm glad you came up anyway.
[2947.80 → 2948.64] Anybody else want some?
[2948.76 → 2948.84] Here.
[2949.52 → 2949.68] Yeah?
[2950.36 → 2951.30] Okay so let's say
[2951.30 → 2952.66] you've asked
[2952.66 → 2953.98] and let's say
[2953.98 → 2954.80] you've taken one
[2954.80 → 2956.96] and then let's say
[2956.96 → 2957.86] you get maybe
[2957.86 → 2959.08] a little bit greedy
[2959.08 → 2959.78] and you're like
[2959.78 → 2960.48] oh you know what
[2960.48 → 2961.20] one was good.
[2961.64 → 2962.42] I want another one.
[2962.64 → 2963.18] What would you do?
[2964.70 → 2965.78] Yeah you would ask again
[2965.78 → 2965.96] right?
[2966.02 → 2966.26] You'd be like
[2966.26 → 2966.92] hey can I have another one
[2966.92 → 2967.70] but what if I said no?
[2967.90 → 2968.44] One's enough?
[2970.28 → 2970.88] You'd say okay
[2970.88 → 2971.60] but what if you really
[2971.60 → 2972.36] wanted that candy?
[2973.26 → 2974.14] And then you'd ask again
[2974.14 → 2974.52] and be like
[2974.52 → 2975.54] could I have another one though?
[2975.72 → 2976.16] I'd be like no.
[2976.24 → 2976.70] I said no.
[2977.12 → 2978.12] You said, but I want another one.
[2978.16 → 2978.88] Could I have another one?
[2979.18 → 2979.84] Would your parents
[2979.84 → 2981.04] give you a second candy
[2981.04 → 2982.22] if you just kept asking
[2982.22 → 2982.98] and asking and asking?
[2983.80 → 2984.54] No they wouldn't.
[2984.72 → 2985.10] In fact
[2985.10 → 2986.18] if your parents are like me
[2986.18 → 2986.64] they might even take
[2986.64 → 2987.30] that first one away
[2987.30 → 2987.56] and be like
[2987.56 → 2988.20] nah you're being greedy
[2988.20 → 2988.80] you don't even get one.
[2989.14 → 2990.12] I'm not your parents though
[2990.12 → 2990.68] so you can have
[2990.68 → 2991.34] as many as you want.
[2994.46 → 2995.72] But the point stands right?
[2995.76 → 2996.50] Let's not be too greedy.
[2996.58 → 2997.36] Make sure everybody gets some.
[2997.36 → 2998.12] Make sure everybody gets some.
[2999.26 → 3000.28] Who hasn't got more?
[3001.18 → 3001.76] Sorry church
[3001.76 → 3002.20] you're just going to have
[3002.20 → 3003.02] to be patient for a second.
[3004.38 → 3005.16] Alright there we go.
[3005.22 → 3005.96] If you've got a few
[3005.96 → 3006.96] then you can head on
[3006.96 → 3007.66] back to your seat.
[3012.78 → 3013.94] They left two church.
[3014.06 → 3014.86] Anybody want one?
[3017.36 → 3018.06] Coming in the middle.
[3018.06 → 3018.16] Come in.
[3018.16 → 3018.24] Come in.
[3018.24 → 3018.34] Come in.
[3018.34 → 3018.36] Come in.
[3018.36 → 3018.42] Come in.
[3018.42 → 3018.48] Come in.
[3018.48 → 3018.54] Come in.
[3018.54 → 3018.60] Come in.
[3018.60 → 3018.90] Come in.
[3018.90 → 3018.98] Come in.
[3018.98 → 3019.48] Come in.
[3019.48 → 3020.48] Come in.
[3020.48 → 3020.98] Come in.
[3020.98 → 3021.98] Come in.
[3021.98 → 3022.98] Come in.
[3022.98 → 3023.98] Come in.
[3023.98 → 3024.98] Come in.
[3024.98 → 3025.98] Come in.
[3025.98 → 3026.98] Come in.
[3026.98 → 3028.86] You don't just get what you want
[3028.86 → 3030.78] if you keep asking for what you want.
[3030.88 → 3031.92] We see that with children.
[3031.92 → 3033.08] If you're a parent.
[3033.28 → 3034.08] If you're a grandparent.
[3034.28 → 3035.26] If you're an uncle or an aunt.
[3035.42 → 3036.58] Actually maybe not a grandparent.
[3036.64 → 3037.74] It seems like the grandparents
[3037.74 → 3039.08] of my kids cave all the time
[3039.08 → 3040.36] when my kids keep asking for stuff.
[3040.68 → 3041.58] But the point is
[3041.58 → 3043.46] just because we're persistent
[3043.46 → 3044.30] when we ask
[3044.30 → 3045.30] it doesn't mean
[3045.30 → 3046.82] that you get what you want.
[3046.88 → 3047.70] In fact it can become
[3047.70 → 3048.56] hugely selfish.
[3048.74 → 3049.62] And that cannot be
[3049.62 → 3050.58] the point
[3050.58 → 3051.94] of this parable.
[3052.90 → 3053.42] And yet perhaps
[3053.42 → 3054.56] that's how we read this passage.
[3054.68 → 3055.82] We hear these words
[3055.82 → 3056.18] and we say
[3056.18 → 3057.36] God I want that job.
[3058.02 → 3059.08] Or I want that house.
[3059.80 → 3060.76] Or that scholarship.
[3061.22 → 3062.04] Or that spouse.
[3062.28 → 3063.04] Or health.
[3063.36 → 3064.42] Or I want this car.
[3064.86 → 3065.90] Or whatever it is.
[3066.00 → 3066.50] And you said
[3066.50 → 3068.12] if I keep asking God
[3068.12 → 3069.46] you would give it to me.
[3069.58 → 3070.58] If I was persistent
[3070.58 → 3071.36] like that widow
[3071.36 → 3072.56] you would give it to me.
[3072.90 → 3074.06] So why don't I have it yet?
[3076.22 → 3076.90] But that's not
[3076.90 → 3077.98] what this parable is about.
[3079.46 → 3080.36] Despite maybe
[3080.36 → 3082.20] what some prosperity preachers
[3082.20 → 3083.20] like Joel Osteen
[3083.20 → 3083.58] or others
[3083.58 → 3084.20] would make you think
[3084.20 → 3084.92] this is not how
[3084.92 → 3086.86] the kingdom of God works.
[3087.24 → 3088.04] You don't just get
[3088.04 → 3088.86] what you want
[3088.86 → 3090.40] if you pray for it enough.
[3093.34 → 3094.62] This parable is not about
[3094.62 → 3096.38] praying for what we want
[3096.38 → 3097.34] or even praying
[3097.34 → 3098.36] for what we need.
[3099.06 → 3099.88] It's about being
[3099.88 → 3101.52] persistent in prayer
[3101.52 → 3102.78] so that God will give us
[3102.78 → 3103.84] it's not about
[3103.84 → 3104.80] being persistent in prayer
[3104.80 → 3105.80] so that God will give us
[3105.80 → 3106.78] what we're asking for
[3106.78 → 3108.30] regardless if it's important
[3108.30 → 3109.34] or selfless
[3109.34 → 3109.92] or healthy.
[3111.28 → 3112.76] This parable is about
[3112.76 → 3114.26] us being persistent
[3114.26 → 3115.38] in our faith
[3115.38 → 3117.18] no matter the context
[3117.18 → 3118.32] we find ourselves in.
[3119.32 → 3120.54] And when we're persistent
[3120.54 → 3121.26] in our faith
[3121.26 → 3122.70] we root ourselves
[3122.70 → 3123.44] in the hope
[3123.44 → 3125.38] found in God's promises
[3125.38 → 3125.94] for us.
[3126.80 → 3127.48] We're going to look
[3127.48 → 3127.96] at this parable
[3127.96 → 3128.54] a little closer.
[3128.90 → 3129.68] There are a few characters
[3129.68 → 3130.50] that need fleshing out
[3130.50 → 3131.14] maybe a little bit
[3131.14 → 3131.94] so we'll look at
[3131.94 → 3132.56] the widow first.
[3132.70 → 3133.48] She's sort of the title
[3133.48 → 3134.46] character after all.
[3134.80 → 3136.00] Now in the ancient Near East
[3136.00 → 3137.64] a widow was often left
[3137.64 → 3138.88] with no means of support.
[3139.74 → 3140.38] Widows were left
[3140.38 → 3141.30] with essentially
[3141.30 → 3142.38] one of two options
[3142.38 → 3143.28] but both of them
[3143.28 → 3143.90] were not ideal.
[3144.68 → 3145.36] They could remain
[3145.36 → 3146.60] in their husband's family
[3146.60 → 3148.04] but they would have
[3148.04 → 3148.84] at that point
[3148.84 → 3150.72] maintained a borderline
[3150.72 → 3151.98] servant type position
[3151.98 → 3153.12] or if they returned
[3153.12 → 3154.32] to their original family
[3154.32 → 3155.34] all the money
[3155.34 → 3156.46] exchanged at the marriage
[3156.46 → 3157.40] would have to be given back
[3157.40 → 3158.26] and she would once again
[3158.26 → 3159.70] be left with nothing.
[3159.84 → 3161.14] So widows were victimized
[3161.14 → 3162.14] to the point
[3162.14 → 3162.76] that they would often
[3162.76 → 3164.18] be sold as slaves
[3164.18 → 3165.44] to repay a debt.
[3165.50 → 3166.34] It was very brutal.
[3167.76 → 3169.08] Now despite all of this
[3169.08 → 3170.72] care for the widow
[3170.72 → 3171.96] was something that
[3171.96 → 3172.94] God expected
[3172.94 → 3173.86] from his people.
[3174.78 → 3175.78] There are countless verses
[3175.78 → 3176.58] in the Old Testament
[3176.58 → 3177.52] where God calls
[3177.52 → 3178.12] on his people
[3178.12 → 3179.20] especially leaders
[3179.20 → 3179.72] and judges
[3179.72 → 3181.54] to look favourably
[3181.54 → 3182.60] upon widows.
[3183.12 → 3183.80] In fact if you want
[3183.80 → 3184.50] to know who God
[3184.50 → 3186.26] considered vulnerable people
[3186.26 → 3186.94] if you want to know
[3186.94 → 3188.12] who God considered
[3188.12 → 3189.02] the least of these
[3189.02 → 3189.78] it's the trilogy
[3189.78 → 3190.36] of the widow
[3190.36 → 3190.86] the orphan
[3190.86 → 3191.68] and the stranger.
[3192.72 → 3193.94] There are over 80 verses
[3193.94 → 3195.80] directly referencing
[3195.80 → 3197.20] care for widows
[3197.20 → 3197.84] in the scriptures
[3197.84 → 3198.98] and almost all of them
[3198.98 → 3200.10] also include orphans
[3200.10 → 3201.12] and strangers
[3201.12 → 3202.28] as well.
[3202.36 → 3203.54] God has a huge heart
[3203.54 → 3204.40] for the vulnerable
[3204.40 → 3205.36] and the oppressed
[3205.36 → 3206.18] a huge heart
[3206.18 → 3206.76] for the widow.
[3208.78 → 3209.30] Unfortunately
[3209.30 → 3210.54] while information
[3210.54 → 3211.96] about the judicial systems
[3211.96 → 3212.66] functioning in
[3212.66 → 3213.64] first century Palestine
[3213.64 → 3214.48] were a little spotty
[3214.48 → 3215.12] for me to find
[3215.12 → 3216.28] what wasn't hard
[3216.28 → 3217.02] to learn
[3217.02 → 3218.12] was that despite
[3218.12 → 3219.44] the desperate situation
[3219.44 → 3220.64] that many widows
[3220.64 → 3221.22] would have faced
[3221.22 → 3221.92] in that time
[3221.92 → 3223.80] their cares often fell
[3223.80 → 3225.24] upon unsympathetic judges
[3225.24 → 3226.22] that ruled over them.
[3226.86 → 3227.44] Judges that would
[3227.44 → 3228.86] take bribes
[3228.86 → 3229.92] instead of seek to help.
[3230.12 → 3230.90] And in this parable
[3230.90 → 3232.00] this is how this plays out.
[3232.74 → 3233.08] The widow
[3233.08 → 3234.12] who's the clear picture
[3234.12 → 3234.54] of the one
[3234.54 → 3235.16] who needs help
[3235.16 → 3236.02] is overlooked
[3236.02 → 3236.80] by this judge
[3236.80 → 3238.02] over and over
[3238.02 → 3239.04] and over again.
[3239.18 → 3239.66] And so instead
[3239.66 → 3240.64] of just taking
[3240.64 → 3241.54] the uninterested
[3241.54 → 3242.46] shoulder shrugs
[3242.46 → 3243.08] that the judge
[3243.08 → 3243.96] is dishing out to her
[3243.96 → 3245.02] she persists.
[3246.32 → 3247.18] Now notice this too
[3247.18 → 3248.54] unlike many pictures
[3248.54 → 3249.14] maybe you see
[3249.14 → 3249.94] in children's books
[3249.94 → 3251.10] or on the table
[3251.10 → 3251.84] in the back there
[3251.84 → 3252.56] this widow
[3252.56 → 3253.48] likely didn't just
[3253.48 → 3254.88] quietly keep showing up
[3254.88 → 3255.78] and sitting in the corner.
[3255.78 → 3257.80] I think for those of us
[3257.80 → 3258.16] who have heard
[3258.16 → 3259.26] this parable before
[3259.26 → 3260.40] we often have
[3260.40 → 3260.94] this picture
[3260.94 → 3262.08] of a sweet old lady
[3262.08 → 3262.88] sitting in the corner
[3262.88 → 3263.28] knitting
[3263.28 → 3264.68] just hoping that the judge
[3264.68 → 3265.54] might pay some attention
[3265.54 → 3265.98] to her.
[3266.54 → 3267.38] Constantly just being
[3267.38 → 3267.90] a presence
[3267.90 → 3269.86] in the corner
[3269.86 → 3270.70] but that's not the case.
[3271.76 → 3273.40] This judge relents.
[3273.50 → 3274.42] He finally caves
[3274.42 → 3275.00] to the widow
[3275.00 → 3276.60] because he's worried
[3276.60 → 3277.66] she will attack him.
[3278.54 → 3279.70] That's what the NIV says.
[3280.36 → 3281.24] Other translations
[3281.24 → 3282.28] indicate that she's getting
[3282.28 → 3283.24] or this judge story
[3283.24 → 3283.92] is getting tired
[3283.92 → 3284.88] of being berated.
[3285.24 → 3286.08] She's just causing him
[3286.08 → 3286.74] too much grief
[3286.74 → 3287.68] too much stress
[3287.68 → 3288.46] too much of a headache
[3288.46 → 3289.76] and the judge finally snaps.
[3291.10 → 3292.26] She's not a sweet
[3292.26 → 3293.26] quiet old lady.
[3294.34 → 3295.82] She is demanding justice.
[3296.08 → 3297.48] She is demanding change.
[3297.54 → 3298.32] She is confident
[3298.32 → 3299.38] that this judge
[3299.38 → 3300.36] can change her future
[3300.36 → 3301.22] and she is not
[3301.22 → 3302.18] quietly present.
[3302.52 → 3303.82] She is a presence
[3303.82 → 3305.42] in the face of this judge.
[3306.82 → 3307.36] And so the fudge
[3307.36 → 3308.28] the fudge
[3308.28 → 3310.70] the judge finally caves.
[3310.70 → 3313.98] So let's look at this judge
[3313.98 → 3314.50] for a second.
[3314.78 → 3315.50] Now he's described
[3315.50 → 3317.02] as a man who doesn't fear God
[3317.02 → 3317.80] or even care
[3317.80 → 3318.80] what men think of him.
[3318.86 → 3319.36] He's a bully
[3319.36 → 3320.94] which we see in both
[3320.94 → 3321.54] his actions
[3321.54 → 3322.52] and his description.
[3323.08 → 3324.40] He's described as unjust
[3324.40 → 3325.10] and selfish
[3325.10 → 3326.62] and yet eventually
[3326.62 → 3328.40] he rules in favour
[3328.40 → 3329.04] of this widow.
[3330.54 → 3331.70] The judge can't handle
[3331.70 → 3332.30] the rebuking
[3332.30 → 3332.88] the noise
[3332.88 → 3333.62] the nagging
[3333.62 → 3334.68] the aggression
[3334.68 → 3335.98] of this widow
[3335.98 → 3336.84] and so he resents
[3336.84 → 3338.20] and rules in favour
[3338.20 → 3338.80] of her
[3338.80 → 3339.82] giving her the justice
[3339.82 → 3340.68] that she seeks.
[3341.00 → 3342.56] Finally doing the right thing
[3342.56 → 3343.66] even if it's for all
[3343.66 → 3344.30] the wrong reasons.
[3346.58 → 3347.86] And then to our benefit
[3347.86 → 3349.76] Luke actually tells us
[3349.76 → 3351.22] who these two people represent.
[3352.12 → 3353.88] He says that God's chosen people
[3353.88 → 3354.48] the believers
[3354.48 → 3355.30] his children
[3355.30 → 3356.32] are the widow
[3356.32 → 3358.00] and that God
[3358.00 → 3358.96] is the judge.
[3360.42 → 3361.54] It means that we
[3361.54 → 3362.70] are the aggressive ones.
[3362.84 → 3363.50] We are the ones
[3363.50 → 3364.62] clamouring for God
[3364.62 → 3365.84] to change our futures
[3365.84 → 3367.64] to change the future.
[3367.64 → 3368.84] And Jesus here
[3368.84 → 3369.60] doesn't say
[3369.60 → 3370.62] we should stop
[3370.62 → 3371.12] notice.
[3372.46 → 3373.90] He doesn't call us
[3373.90 → 3374.72] to be quiet
[3374.72 → 3376.54] make quiet little appeals
[3376.54 → 3377.60] be quietly sitting
[3377.60 → 3378.12] in the corner.
[3378.24 → 3378.98] He doesn't say
[3378.98 → 3380.20] we need to be more kind
[3380.20 → 3381.18] in our requests
[3381.18 → 3382.68] or to wait in silence
[3382.68 → 3383.44] as he works.
[3383.56 → 3383.70] No.
[3384.24 → 3385.16] When we're hurt
[3385.16 → 3386.40] we're allowed
[3386.40 → 3387.76] to cry out to God.
[3388.18 → 3389.24] When things are unjust
[3389.24 → 3390.72] we can shout at him.
[3391.40 → 3392.70] When we need to lament
[3392.70 → 3393.74] or cry out
[3393.74 → 3395.38] or scream in frustration
[3395.38 → 3396.86] because our adversaries
[3396.86 → 3397.62] are piling up
[3397.62 → 3398.20] be them people
[3398.20 → 3398.74] or problems
[3398.74 → 3399.76] we find ourselves in
[3399.76 → 3400.86] we should lament
[3400.86 → 3401.70] but we should lament
[3401.70 → 3402.24] to him.
[3402.82 → 3403.42] We should lament
[3403.42 → 3404.48] to our God.
[3405.14 → 3405.88] Not rant
[3405.88 → 3406.88] to our echo chambers
[3406.88 → 3407.86] that we find online
[3407.86 → 3408.96] or chatter with
[3408.96 → 3409.76] our gossip groups
[3409.76 → 3410.48] that we meet with
[3410.48 → 3410.98] for coffee
[3410.98 → 3412.18] but to God.
[3413.28 → 3414.10] That's what he's
[3414.10 → 3414.78] calling us to do
[3414.78 → 3415.84] to be persistent
[3415.84 → 3416.90] in faith
[3416.90 → 3417.78] to him
[3417.78 → 3418.82] no matter what.
[3420.02 → 3421.50] He's inviting us
[3421.50 → 3422.88] to be persistent
[3422.88 → 3424.40] not just quietly
[3424.40 → 3425.78] but vocally
[3425.78 → 3427.70] because he is there.
[3430.70 → 3432.00] And he's not just
[3432.00 → 3432.96] ignoring us
[3432.96 → 3434.28] for a season
[3434.28 → 3436.90] like this unjust judge was.
[3440.52 → 3442.32] Notice what verse 6 and 7 say.
[3442.42 → 3444.78] Listen to what the unjust judge says
[3444.78 → 3446.90] and will not God
[3446.90 → 3448.36] bring about justice
[3448.36 → 3449.40] for his chosen ones
[3449.40 → 3450.64] who cry to him
[3450.64 → 3451.68] day and night.
[3451.68 → 3452.64] Will he keep
[3452.64 → 3453.60] putting them on?
[3455.24 → 3456.66] This parable is teaching us
[3456.66 → 3459.12] that even this unjust judge
[3459.12 → 3460.64] eventually brings out
[3460.64 → 3461.68] justice for this widow.
[3462.26 → 3463.64] So imagine what God
[3463.64 → 3464.46] will do for you.
[3466.62 → 3467.92] This judge in the parable
[3467.92 → 3468.46] is a school
[3468.46 → 3469.44] but God
[3469.44 → 3470.84] he is so much
[3470.84 → 3471.60] greater
[3471.60 → 3472.76] and the Psalms
[3472.76 → 3473.46] describe him
[3473.46 → 3474.00] beautifully.
[3474.36 → 3475.68] Check out what the Psalms
[3475.68 → 3476.52] describe God as.
[3476.76 → 3478.16] Our God is loving.
[3478.96 → 3480.22] Our God is righteous.
[3480.22 → 3482.18] Our God is powerful.
[3482.78 → 3484.02] Our God is just.
[3484.44 → 3485.50] Our God is compassionate.
[3486.18 → 3487.10] Our God is good.
[3488.06 → 3489.06] Our God is merciful.
[3489.90 → 3490.92] Our God is strong.
[3491.72 → 3492.48] That's just one book
[3492.48 → 3492.96] of the Bible.
[3494.08 → 3495.38] Our God is an ever-present
[3495.38 → 3496.76] help in times of trouble.
[3496.88 → 3498.42] That's what Psalm 46.1 says.
[3498.62 → 3499.70] The question isn't
[3499.70 → 3502.00] will God be there for us
[3502.00 → 3504.48], or will God provide for us?
[3505.48 → 3507.14] Our God is so much bigger
[3507.14 → 3507.82] and greater
[3507.82 → 3508.50] and gentler
[3508.50 → 3509.32] and powerful
[3509.32 → 3510.22] and more loving
[3510.22 → 3511.60] than we can imagine.
[3511.72 → 3512.86] He is there for you
[3512.86 → 3513.54] no matter what.
[3516.82 → 3517.86] Now while
[3517.86 → 3519.60] he is there for you
[3519.60 → 3521.60] as we discussed earlier
[3521.60 → 3523.50] he is not some genie
[3523.50 → 3524.28] who is available
[3524.28 → 3525.46] to answer any wish
[3525.46 → 3526.12] you may have
[3526.12 → 3527.36] if you only ask him
[3527.36 → 3527.94] enough times.
[3528.38 → 3529.36] That is not what
[3529.36 → 3530.40] this parable is getting at.
[3530.62 → 3531.56] This parable is not
[3531.56 → 3532.48] teaching his disciples
[3532.48 → 3533.30] to pray for stuff
[3533.30 → 3534.10] and you'll get it.
[3534.10 → 3534.26] No.
[3534.94 → 3535.66] This parable
[3535.66 → 3537.96] Jesus is telling
[3537.96 → 3538.52] the disciples
[3538.52 → 3539.56] that when they pray
[3539.56 → 3540.52] for what they need
[3540.52 → 3541.64] for love
[3541.64 → 3542.46] for hope
[3542.46 → 3543.40] for justice
[3543.40 → 3544.06] for shalom
[3544.06 → 3545.34] that it's coming.
[3546.38 → 3547.60] It is coming.
[3547.72 → 3548.76] They will receive it.
[3548.96 → 3550.26] It may take some time
[3550.26 → 3550.86] but they
[3550.86 → 3552.10] and they may need
[3552.10 → 3552.84] to wait for it.
[3553.26 → 3554.12] They might even feel
[3554.12 → 3555.22] like it's taking too long
[3555.22 → 3557.40] but it is coming.
[3561.40 → 3562.40] Brothers and sisters
[3562.40 → 3562.88] here today
[3562.88 → 3563.94] Jesus is teaching us
[3563.94 → 3565.10] the same thing.
[3566.24 → 3567.26] If we wait
[3567.26 → 3567.92] on the Lord
[3567.92 → 3568.64] he will renew
[3568.64 → 3569.74] our strength.
[3570.06 → 3570.46] Our God
[3570.46 → 3571.52] our affectionate
[3571.52 → 3572.26] righteous
[3572.26 → 3573.06] powerful
[3573.06 → 3573.54] just
[3573.54 → 3574.16] compassionate
[3574.16 → 3574.54] good
[3574.54 → 3575.20] merciful
[3575.20 → 3575.94] strong
[3575.94 → 3576.94] judge
[3576.94 → 3578.48] loves us.
[3579.50 → 3580.52] He is there for us.
[3580.84 → 3581.92] Unconditional love
[3581.92 → 3583.50] is ours for the receiving.
[3584.08 → 3584.94] Hope is found
[3584.94 → 3585.56] in him.
[3585.64 → 3586.30] He is just.
[3586.68 → 3587.82] Shalom is coming
[3587.82 → 3589.14] for all who believe.
[3589.22 → 3589.78] No matter what
[3589.78 → 3591.14] crisis we find
[3591.14 → 3591.72] ourselves in
[3591.72 → 3592.76] that truth
[3592.76 → 3593.58] remains.
[3594.58 → 3595.40] And when we are
[3595.40 → 3596.06] persistent
[3596.06 → 3597.68] in our prayer
[3597.68 → 3598.12] when we are
[3598.12 → 3598.64] persistent
[3598.64 → 3599.68] in our faith
[3599.68 → 3600.14] when we are
[3600.14 → 3600.84] relentlessly
[3600.84 → 3601.66] faithful
[3601.66 → 3602.30] in the midst
[3602.30 → 3603.18] of adversity
[3603.18 → 3603.88] like this widow
[3603.88 → 3604.26] was
[3604.26 → 3605.90] our foundation
[3605.90 → 3607.24] remains secure
[3607.24 → 3608.40] and our
[3608.40 → 3609.04] perspectives
[3609.04 → 3610.52] change.
[3611.56 → 3612.46] And that's
[3612.46 → 3612.92] the key.
[3614.80 → 3615.62] Sometimes our
[3615.62 → 3616.32] contexts
[3616.32 → 3617.10] won't immediately
[3617.10 → 3617.66] get better.
[3617.78 → 3618.30] Sometimes they
[3618.30 → 3618.78] might not get
[3618.78 → 3619.38] better at all
[3619.38 → 3620.00] but Jesus
[3620.00 → 3621.60] helps change
[3621.60 → 3622.72] our perspectives
[3622.72 → 3624.54] which allows us
[3624.54 → 3624.98] to root
[3624.98 → 3625.64] ourselves
[3625.64 → 3626.28] on his
[3626.28 → 3627.02] solid ground.
[3629.20 → 3629.88] Now there's
[3629.88 → 3630.34] two ways
[3630.34 → 3630.72] that our
[3630.72 → 3631.16] perspectives
[3631.16 → 3631.56] shift
[3631.56 → 3632.36] when we are
[3632.36 → 3632.80] persistent
[3632.80 → 3633.54] in our faith
[3633.54 → 3635.00] and that is
[3635.00 → 3635.50] that we become
[3635.50 → 3636.52] less complacent
[3636.52 → 3637.54] in our faith
[3637.54 → 3637.96] lives
[3637.96 → 3639.24] and we
[3639.24 → 3639.94] rediscover
[3639.94 → 3640.74] the eternal
[3640.74 → 3641.42] hope found
[3641.42 → 3642.00] in the one
[3642.00 → 3642.46] to whom
[3642.46 → 3642.68] we are
[3642.68 → 3643.24] praying for
[3643.24 → 3643.98] or praying
[3643.98 → 3644.18] to.
[3644.32 → 3644.46] Sorry.
[3646.36 → 3646.64] So whether
[3646.64 → 3647.28] life is going
[3647.28 → 3647.78] well or
[3647.78 → 3648.20] life is
[3648.20 → 3649.10] crashing in
[3649.10 → 3649.54] around us
[3649.54 → 3650.02] we're called
[3650.02 → 3650.32] to be
[3650.32 → 3650.86] persistent
[3650.86 → 3651.82] in our
[3651.82 → 3652.68] faithfulness
[3652.68 → 3653.04] to him.
[3654.24 → 3654.68] Praying
[3654.68 → 3654.96] to him
[3654.96 → 3655.44] thanking
[3655.44 → 3655.78] him
[3655.78 → 3656.30] crying
[3656.30 → 3656.58] out
[3656.58 → 3656.82] to him
[3656.82 → 3657.34] lamenting
[3657.34 → 3657.66] to him
[3657.66 → 3658.24] all of
[3658.24 → 3658.38] that
[3658.38 → 3658.92] acknowledges
[3658.92 → 3659.16] him.
[3661.46 → 3662.02] And when
[3662.02 → 3662.28] we do
[3662.28 → 3662.92] those things
[3662.92 → 3663.44] two things
[3663.44 → 3663.66] happen.
[3663.76 → 3663.94] First
[3663.94 → 3664.74] we become
[3664.74 → 3665.06] less
[3665.06 → 3665.72] complacent
[3665.72 → 3666.04] in our
[3666.04 → 3666.30] faith
[3666.30 → 3666.66] lives
[3666.66 → 3667.32] and we
[3667.32 → 3667.74] combat
[3667.74 → 3668.52] what I
[3668.52 → 3668.84] like to
[3668.84 → 3669.02] call
[3669.02 → 3669.44] covenant
[3669.44 → 3670.06] child
[3670.06 → 3670.62] syndrome.
[3670.84 → 3670.92] Now
[3670.92 → 3671.24] covenant
[3671.24 → 3671.62] child
[3671.62 → 3672.00] syndrome
[3672.00 → 3672.48] it's
[3672.48 → 3672.58] an
[3672.58 → 3672.94] affliction
[3672.94 → 3673.28] that some
[3673.28 → 3673.50] of us
[3673.50 → 3673.68] youth
[3673.68 → 3674.00] pastors
[3674.00 → 3674.44] came up
[3674.44 → 3674.78] a while
[3674.78 → 3675.06] ago
[3675.06 → 3676.06] that affects
[3676.06 → 3676.58] those of
[3676.58 → 3676.82] us
[3676.82 → 3677.30] who have
[3677.30 → 3677.48] been
[3677.48 → 3677.88] baptized
[3677.88 → 3678.46] in the
[3678.46 → 3678.70] church
[3678.70 → 3679.28] and even
[3679.28 → 3679.74] professed
[3679.74 → 3679.86] our
[3679.86 → 3680.10] faith
[3680.10 → 3680.38] in the
[3680.38 → 3680.66] church
[3680.66 → 3681.30] but are
[3681.30 → 3681.48] now
[3681.48 → 3681.84] simply
[3681.84 → 3682.18] sort of
[3682.18 → 3682.70] coasting
[3682.70 → 3682.92] in our
[3682.92 → 3683.14] faith
[3683.14 → 3683.54] lives.
[3683.96 → 3684.04] We
[3684.04 → 3684.36] believe
[3684.36 → 3684.82] in God
[3684.82 → 3685.36] and in
[3685.36 → 3685.60] Jesus
[3685.60 → 3686.34] gospel
[3686.34 → 3686.62] truth
[3686.62 → 3686.86] of his
[3686.86 → 3687.10] life
[3687.10 → 3687.30] death
[3687.30 → 3687.42] and
[3687.42 → 3687.78] resurrection
[3687.78 → 3688.34] and now
[3688.34 → 3688.64] we feel
[3688.64 → 3688.92] like we
[3688.92 → 3689.26] can just
[3689.26 → 3689.84] sort of
[3689.84 → 3690.26] do what
[3690.26 → 3690.64] we want.
[3691.34 → 3691.68] We think
[3691.68 → 3692.14] God's grace
[3692.14 → 3692.74] is big
[3692.74 → 3692.96] and we
[3692.96 → 3693.22] know that
[3693.22 → 3693.38] we're
[3693.38 → 3693.90] saved
[3693.90 → 3694.24] and God
[3694.24 → 3694.70] has chosen
[3694.70 → 3695.04] us
[3695.04 → 3695.56] and we're
[3695.56 → 3696.06] generally
[3696.06 → 3696.64] pretty nice
[3696.64 → 3697.06] people
[3697.06 → 3698.08] so we
[3698.08 → 3698.34] can go
[3698.34 → 3698.64] about our
[3698.64 → 3698.88] days
[3698.88 → 3699.14] without
[3699.14 → 3699.44] thinking
[3699.44 → 3700.08] too much
[3700.08 → 3700.76] about God
[3700.76 → 3701.18] or his
[3701.18 → 3701.58] role in
[3701.58 → 3701.94] our lives
[3701.94 → 3702.36] or how
[3702.36 → 3702.94] the gospel
[3702.94 → 3703.32] truth
[3703.32 → 3703.84] should
[3703.84 → 3704.48] transform
[3704.48 → 3705.16] everything.
[3706.92 → 3707.20] Now this
[3707.20 → 3707.56] way of
[3707.56 → 3707.80] thinking
[3707.80 → 3708.28] makes us
[3708.28 → 3708.72] lazy
[3708.72 → 3709.02] it makes
[3709.02 → 3709.18] us
[3709.18 → 3709.78] complacent
[3709.78 → 3710.26] and it
[3710.26 → 3710.72] distances
[3710.72 → 3711.08] us
[3711.08 → 3711.80] from God
[3711.80 → 3712.48] and it
[3712.48 → 3712.88] distances
[3712.88 → 3713.20] us
[3713.20 → 3713.50] from the
[3713.50 → 3713.84] calling
[3713.84 → 3714.14] that God
[3714.14 → 3714.56] has placed
[3714.56 → 3714.92] on our
[3714.92 → 3715.40] lives
[3715.40 → 3716.02] to be
[3716.02 → 3716.50] the body
[3716.50 → 3717.08] of Christ.
[3719.08 → 3719.62] When we
[3719.62 → 3719.94] think this
[3719.94 → 3720.16] way we
[3720.16 → 3720.72] stop serving
[3720.72 → 3720.98] in the
[3720.98 → 3721.18] church
[3721.18 → 3721.48] because
[3721.48 → 3721.72] what's
[3721.72 → 3722.08] the point
[3722.08 → 3722.48] someone else
[3722.48 → 3722.72] is going
[3722.72 → 3722.92] to do
[3722.92 → 3723.02] it.
[3723.18 → 3723.28] We
[3723.28 → 3723.54] stop
[3723.54 → 3724.18] sharing
[3724.18 → 3724.58] the good
[3724.58 → 3724.86] news
[3724.86 → 3725.22] to our
[3725.22 → 3725.70] colleagues
[3725.70 → 3726.04] because
[3726.04 → 3726.74] that seems
[3726.74 → 3727.44] too hard
[3727.44 → 3727.82] and too
[3727.82 → 3728.30] uncomfortable.
[3728.64 → 3728.98] We stop
[3728.98 → 3729.50] reading the
[3729.50 → 3729.98] Bible at
[3729.98 → 3730.20] home
[3730.20 → 3730.56] because
[3730.56 → 3731.10] Pastor
[3731.10 → 3731.32] Chris
[3731.32 → 3731.70] does that
[3731.70 → 3732.04] for us
[3732.04 → 3732.56] every Sunday
[3732.56 → 3732.96] so we're
[3732.96 → 3733.16] good.
[3733.58 → 3733.96] We stop
[3733.96 → 3734.54] doing family
[3734.54 → 3735.12] devotions
[3735.12 → 3735.54] around the
[3735.54 → 3736.14] table at
[3736.14 → 3736.36] night
[3736.36 → 3736.70] because
[3736.70 → 3737.44] we've got
[3737.44 → 3737.94] sports to
[3737.94 → 3738.26] get to
[3738.26 → 3738.66] or meetings
[3738.66 → 3739.24] to attend
[3739.24 → 3739.84] or rehearsals
[3739.84 → 3740.26] to see.
[3740.82 → 3741.44] We stop
[3741.44 → 3742.22] praying
[3742.22 → 3743.32] because we
[3743.32 → 3743.88] kind of have
[3743.88 → 3744.40] things under
[3744.40 → 3744.92] control.
[3746.80 → 3747.56] We stop
[3747.56 → 3748.24] thinking about
[3748.24 → 3748.78] the fact
[3748.78 → 3749.70] that Jesus
[3749.70 → 3750.32] is coming
[3750.32 → 3750.74] again
[3750.74 → 3751.50] because it
[3751.50 → 3751.98] seems to
[3751.98 → 3752.50] be taking
[3752.50 → 3753.32] him so
[3753.32 → 3753.84] long to
[3753.84 → 3754.30] do so.
[3756.38 → 3757.18] We stop
[3757.18 → 3758.20] being persistently
[3758.20 → 3758.76] faithful
[3758.76 → 3760.12] and forget
[3760.12 → 3760.56] to love
[3760.56 → 3761.20] our Lord
[3761.20 → 3761.66] with all
[3761.66 → 3762.14] our heart
[3762.14 → 3762.62] and all
[3762.62 → 3763.08] our soul
[3763.08 → 3763.50] and all
[3763.50 → 3763.98] our mind
[3763.98 → 3764.50] and instead
[3764.50 → 3765.50] we only
[3765.50 → 3766.06] love him
[3766.06 → 3766.98] when it
[3766.98 → 3767.36] becomes
[3767.36 → 3767.80] convenient
[3767.80 → 3768.44] for us
[3768.44 → 3769.28] or if
[3769.28 → 3769.64] we need
[3769.64 → 3770.06] something
[3770.06 → 3771.02] or if
[3771.02 → 3771.32] things are
[3771.32 → 3771.64] getting a
[3771.64 → 3772.04] little hard.
[3773.52 → 3774.30] We stop
[3774.30 → 3775.18] being persistently
[3775.18 → 3775.88] faithful and we
[3775.88 → 3776.42] forget to love
[3776.42 → 3776.84] our neighbours
[3776.84 → 3777.52] as ourselves
[3777.52 → 3778.32] and instead
[3778.32 → 3779.58] we only love
[3779.58 → 3780.04] those whom
[3780.04 → 3780.54] we are most
[3780.54 → 3781.52] comfortable with
[3781.52 → 3782.02] and only
[3782.02 → 3782.92] whenever they
[3782.92 → 3783.52] are conveniently
[3783.52 → 3784.22] around us.
[3785.94 → 3786.72] Jesus is
[3786.72 → 3787.40] concerned about
[3787.40 → 3787.74] this.
[3787.74 → 3788.54] He says
[3788.54 → 3788.84] so in
[3788.84 → 3789.34] verse 8
[3789.34 → 3790.14] the final
[3790.14 → 3790.52] verse of
[3790.52 → 3790.98] our passage
[3790.98 → 3791.70] when we
[3791.70 → 3792.32] forget to be
[3792.32 → 3792.92] persistent in
[3792.92 → 3793.54] our faithfulness
[3793.54 → 3793.84] to God
[3793.84 → 3794.78] Jesus worries
[3794.78 → 3795.24] that when he
[3795.24 → 3795.82] comes back
[3795.82 → 3796.48] when he returns
[3796.48 → 3797.34] again he will
[3797.34 → 3797.98] find limited
[3797.98 → 3798.30] faith.
[3798.42 → 3798.98] Read verse 8
[3798.98 → 3799.56] with me again.
[3799.98 → 3800.32] When the
[3800.32 → 3800.88] son of man
[3800.88 → 3802.40] comes will
[3802.40 → 3803.24] he finds
[3803.24 → 3804.08] faith on
[3804.08 → 3804.40] earth?
[3806.68 → 3807.34] If we
[3807.34 → 3807.78] aren't being
[3807.78 → 3808.60] persistent in
[3808.60 → 3809.28] our faithfulness
[3809.28 → 3809.80] to God will
[3809.80 → 3810.36] he finds
[3810.36 → 3811.36] faith when
[3811.36 → 3811.80] he comes
[3811.80 → 3812.22] again?
[3812.22 → 3815.46] being
[3815.46 → 3816.10] persistent in
[3816.10 → 3816.44] our faith
[3816.44 → 3816.88] helps us
[3816.88 → 3817.44] shift that
[3817.44 → 3818.00] perspective
[3818.00 → 3818.36] that we
[3818.36 → 3818.66] have and
[3818.66 → 3819.28] it combats
[3819.28 → 3819.52] this
[3819.52 → 3820.14] complacent
[3820.14 → 3820.42] faith.
[3820.54 → 3820.72] When we
[3820.72 → 3821.40] give our
[3821.40 → 3821.82] lives to
[3821.82 → 3822.30] God whether
[3822.30 → 3823.26] we're quietly
[3823.26 → 3824.34] content or
[3824.34 → 3824.80] when we're
[3824.80 → 3825.58] rolling in
[3825.58 → 3826.32] turmoil because
[3826.32 → 3827.28] things seem
[3827.28 → 3827.88] so upside
[3827.88 → 3828.80] down when
[3828.80 → 3829.24] we give
[3829.24 → 3829.70] our lives
[3829.70 → 3830.12] to him
[3830.12 → 3831.16] every day
[3831.16 → 3831.58] we show
[3831.58 → 3832.10] our faith
[3832.10 → 3833.54] we find
[3833.54 → 3834.00] our rock
[3834.00 → 3834.32] we can
[3834.32 → 3834.80] discover
[3834.80 → 3835.64] something
[3835.64 → 3836.46] some new
[3836.46 → 3837.00] stability
[3837.00 → 3838.10] along the
[3838.10 → 3838.34] way.
[3839.02 → 3839.76] I did that
[3839.76 → 3840.14] this week.
[3840.14 → 3841.00] it wasn't
[3841.00 → 3841.86] necessarily a
[3841.86 → 3842.32] bad week
[3842.32 → 3842.84] for me
[3842.84 → 3843.22] although it
[3843.22 → 3843.56] wasn't a
[3843.56 → 3844.00] great week
[3844.00 → 3844.32] either.
[3845.20 → 3846.18] I definitely
[3846.18 → 3846.54] had some
[3846.54 → 3847.14] moments as a
[3847.14 → 3847.58] parent and
[3847.58 → 3848.10] as a husband
[3848.10 → 3848.76] that I regret
[3848.76 → 3849.20] and that I
[3849.20 → 3849.70] wasn't super
[3849.70 → 3850.54] proud of and
[3850.54 → 3850.98] I had heard
[3850.98 → 3851.48] from a couple
[3851.48 → 3852.00] of friends
[3852.00 → 3852.98] some fairly
[3852.98 → 3853.72] big news in
[3853.72 → 3854.26] their lives
[3854.26 → 3854.64] that isn't
[3854.64 → 3855.16] going great
[3855.16 → 3855.56] and their
[3855.56 → 3856.16] lives are
[3856.16 → 3856.46] going to be
[3856.46 → 3857.06] altered going
[3857.06 → 3857.32] forward.
[3857.42 → 3857.60] That was a
[3857.60 → 3857.78] little bit
[3857.78 → 3858.32] difficult to
[3858.32 → 3858.52] hear.
[3860.44 → 3861.26] There was a
[3861.26 → 3861.72] weight to
[3861.72 → 3862.08] this week
[3862.08 → 3862.40] we'll say
[3862.40 → 3862.86] that and I
[3862.86 → 3863.46] found myself
[3863.46 → 3864.14] grumpy and
[3864.14 → 3864.84] sad more than
[3864.84 → 3865.36] I wanted to
[3865.36 → 3865.60] be.
[3866.58 → 3866.96] However
[3866.96 → 3868.10] because I was
[3868.10 → 3868.78] working on this
[3868.78 → 3869.38] all week
[3869.38 → 3870.48] when I was
[3870.48 → 3871.16] feeling burdened
[3871.16 → 3871.56] or hopeless
[3871.56 → 3872.26] or frustrated
[3872.26 → 3873.32] not every time
[3873.32 → 3873.88] but I often
[3873.88 → 3874.48] remembered this
[3874.48 → 3875.18] text that I
[3875.18 → 3875.82] was looking at
[3875.82 → 3876.86] and I
[3876.86 → 3877.38] remembered this
[3877.38 → 3877.92] sermon that I
[3877.92 → 3878.64] was working on
[3878.64 → 3879.20] and every now
[3879.20 → 3879.54] and then I
[3879.54 → 3880.10] found myself
[3880.10 → 3881.28] praying God
[3881.28 → 3881.86] life is a
[3881.86 → 3883.26] mess or God
[3883.26 → 3884.12] I screwed up
[3884.12 → 3885.66] but I know
[3885.66 → 3886.26] you are God
[3886.26 → 3886.84] and I know
[3886.84 → 3887.44] you are good
[3887.44 → 3887.94] and I know
[3887.94 → 3888.64] you are present
[3888.64 → 3890.02] please redeem
[3890.02 → 3890.72] this situation
[3890.72 → 3891.68] help me zoom
[3891.68 → 3892.68] out of my life
[3892.68 → 3893.34] and remember
[3893.34 → 3893.96] how big your
[3893.96 → 3894.80] plan is for
[3894.80 → 3895.20] this world
[3895.20 → 3895.64] around me
[3895.64 → 3896.34] make me less
[3896.34 → 3897.34] make you more
[3897.34 → 3899.68] and every
[3899.68 → 3900.04] time I
[3900.04 → 3900.44] prayed that
[3900.44 → 3900.92] prayer I
[3900.92 → 3902.20] felt lighter
[3902.20 → 3903.64] relieved
[3903.64 → 3904.88] better
[3904.88 → 3907.60] not for the
[3907.60 → 3908.00] rest of the
[3908.00 → 3908.46] week or even
[3908.46 → 3908.88] for the rest
[3908.88 → 3909.40] of the day
[3909.40 → 3911.18] but for a
[3911.18 → 3911.38] while
[3911.38 → 3912.46] now I'm not
[3912.46 → 3914.04] prescribing to
[3914.04 → 3914.44] you that every
[3914.44 → 3915.16] time you pray a
[3915.16 → 3915.90] prayer like that
[3915.90 → 3916.36] your troubles
[3916.36 → 3916.72] are going to
[3916.72 → 3917.18] go away
[3917.18 → 3917.78] or your
[3917.78 → 3918.40] frustrations
[3918.40 → 3919.32] will disintegrate
[3919.32 → 3920.12] or the world
[3920.12 → 3920.72] will change
[3920.72 → 3921.16] forever
[3921.16 → 3922.54] but what this
[3922.54 → 3923.22] text teaches
[3923.22 → 3923.88] us is that
[3923.88 → 3924.82] no matter what
[3924.82 → 3925.44] our context
[3925.44 → 3926.08] we need to be
[3926.08 → 3927.38] persistent in
[3927.38 → 3927.90] prayer and
[3927.90 → 3929.00] understand who
[3929.00 → 3929.86] our God is
[3929.86 → 3931.50] and when we
[3931.50 → 3932.32] grasp that
[3932.32 → 3932.92] everything
[3932.92 → 3934.98] seems to get
[3934.98 → 3935.30] lighter
[3935.30 → 3937.22] in challenging
[3937.22 → 3938.12] situations our
[3938.12 → 3938.88] ground seems a
[3938.88 → 3939.52] little more solid
[3939.52 → 3940.58] and our God
[3940.58 → 3941.36] becomes front and
[3941.36 → 3942.12] centre once again
[3942.12 → 3943.76] and that
[3943.76 → 3944.78] perspective shift
[3944.78 → 3945.74] just roots us in
[3945.74 → 3946.32] him a little bit
[3946.32 → 3946.60] deeper
[3946.60 → 3949.84] the second
[3949.84 → 3950.60] perspective shift
[3950.60 → 3951.32] that happens when
[3951.32 → 3952.16] we are persistent
[3952.16 → 3953.10] in our faithfulness
[3953.10 → 3953.56] and this will
[3953.56 → 3954.42] conclude with this
[3954.42 → 3955.50] one today is
[3955.50 → 3956.54] that we rediscover
[3956.54 → 3958.14] the eternal hope
[3958.14 → 3958.86] found in God's
[3958.86 → 3959.84] kingdom come and
[3959.84 → 3960.58] his kingdom coming
[3960.58 → 3962.80] if you have your
[3962.80 → 3964.08] Bibles open look
[3964.08 → 3965.20] at the second half
[3965.20 → 3966.26] of chapter 17
[3966.26 → 3966.98] that's the chunk
[3966.98 → 3967.82] of text that comes
[3967.82 → 3969.00] right before our
[3969.00 → 3969.74] parable today
[3969.74 → 3972.24] so in the lead up
[3972.24 → 3972.90] to this parable
[3972.90 → 3973.86] in that text
[3973.86 → 3975.00] Jesus is talking
[3975.00 → 3975.62] about when he
[3975.62 → 3976.28] comes again
[3976.28 → 3978.62] his disciples
[3978.62 → 3979.28] perhaps didn't
[3979.28 → 3980.26] grasp the scope
[3980.26 → 3980.92] of this because
[3980.92 → 3982.02] Jesus was still
[3982.02 → 3982.56] there he hadn't
[3982.56 → 3983.64] even died and
[3983.64 → 3984.12] come back the
[3984.12 → 3984.62] first time
[3984.62 → 3986.34] but Jesus is
[3986.34 → 3986.82] talking about
[3986.82 → 3987.26] the future
[3987.26 → 3987.92] when his kingdom
[3987.92 → 3989.02] comes again
[3989.02 → 3991.12] and in that
[3991.12 → 3992.24] chapter Jesus
[3992.24 → 3993.42] says that those
[3993.42 → 3994.12] who are faithful
[3994.12 → 3994.76] will go with
[3994.76 → 3996.04] him and those
[3996.04 → 3996.42] who are not
[3996.42 → 3996.90] will be left
[3996.90 → 3997.30] behind
[3997.30 → 3999.50] and then Jesus
[3999.50 → 4000.10] tells this
[4000.10 → 4000.60] parable
[4000.60 → 4002.96] in the hopes
[4002.96 → 4003.32] that his
[4003.32 → 4004.14] disciples will
[4004.14 → 4004.86] understand that
[4004.86 → 4005.54] no matter what
[4005.54 → 4006.62] trials they are
[4006.62 → 4007.30] going to face
[4007.30 → 4009.68] no matter what
[4009.68 → 4010.10] they will be
[4010.10 → 4011.26] going through
[4011.26 → 4012.30] as they go
[4012.30 → 4012.88] forward God
[4012.88 → 4013.62] calls them
[4013.62 → 4014.50] Jesus calls
[4014.50 → 4015.44] them to
[4015.44 → 4016.70] remain faithful
[4016.70 → 4017.64] always
[4017.64 → 4019.18] and remember
[4019.18 → 4019.88] Jesus knew
[4019.88 → 4020.76] he knew what
[4020.76 → 4021.36] these disciples
[4021.36 → 4021.78] were going to
[4021.78 → 4022.38] face he knew
[4022.38 → 4022.96] that the trials
[4022.96 → 4023.38] they were going
[4023.38 → 4024.26] to come across
[4024.26 → 4024.58] were going to
[4024.58 → 4024.96] be hard
[4024.96 → 4025.58] remember all
[4025.58 → 4026.34] those disciples
[4026.34 → 4027.54] ended up getting
[4027.54 → 4028.20] martyred for
[4028.20 → 4028.66] their faith
[4028.66 → 4029.36] except for John
[4029.36 → 4030.74] who was boiled
[4030.74 → 4031.78] and then sent to
[4031.78 → 4032.36] an island and
[4032.36 → 4033.10] didn't die and
[4033.10 → 4033.44] then had to
[4033.44 → 4033.88] live there for
[4033.88 → 4034.38] a long time
[4034.38 → 4035.44] that's what
[4035.44 → 4035.80] they went
[4035.80 → 4036.10] through
[4036.10 → 4039.38] they were
[4039.38 → 4040.00] persistent
[4040.00 → 4040.34] though
[4040.34 → 4040.64] in their
[4040.64 → 4041.00] faith
[4041.00 → 4042.24] they were
[4042.24 → 4042.94] living for
[4042.94 → 4043.28] Jesus
[4043.28 → 4043.94] persistent
[4043.94 → 4044.34] in their
[4044.34 → 4044.70] love for
[4044.70 → 4044.82] them
[4044.82 → 4045.30] persistent
[4045.30 → 4045.90] in their
[4045.90 → 4046.20] prayers
[4046.20 → 4046.46] to him
[4046.46 → 4046.88] persistent
[4046.88 → 4047.64] even when
[4047.64 → 4047.90] they were
[4047.90 → 4048.40] persecuted
[4048.40 → 4049.26] persistent
[4049.26 → 4050.06] even when
[4050.06 → 4050.50] their friends
[4050.50 → 4050.94] were killed
[4050.94 → 4051.68] even when
[4051.68 → 4052.04] they lost
[4052.04 → 4052.60] everything
[4052.60 → 4053.68] the disciples
[4053.68 → 4054.62] were persistent
[4054.62 → 4055.02] in their
[4055.02 → 4055.50] faithfulness
[4055.50 → 4056.20] because they
[4056.20 → 4056.84] understood
[4056.84 → 4058.20] that Christ's
[4058.20 → 4058.48] kingdom
[4058.48 → 4059.48] was coming
[4059.48 → 4061.76] and they
[4061.76 → 4062.24] later new
[4062.24 → 4062.76] like we do
[4062.76 → 4063.06] now
[4063.06 → 4063.78] that Jesus
[4063.78 → 4064.84] lived this
[4064.84 → 4065.48] life that we
[4065.48 → 4065.80] have been
[4065.80 → 4066.60] called to
[4066.60 → 4066.86] live
[4066.86 → 4067.50] but then he
[4067.50 → 4068.24] died a death
[4068.24 → 4070.12] a terrible
[4070.12 → 4070.86] death that we
[4070.86 → 4071.58] all deserve to
[4071.58 → 4072.06] die but he
[4072.06 → 4072.50] died it in
[4072.50 → 4072.92] our stead
[4072.92 → 4074.02] and he took
[4074.02 → 4074.56] the weight of
[4074.56 → 4075.26] the sins of
[4075.26 → 4075.80] the world on
[4075.80 → 4076.26] his shoulders
[4076.26 → 4076.72] and he went
[4076.72 → 4077.20] to the grave
[4077.20 → 4077.76] with them all
[4077.76 → 4079.36] but then three
[4079.36 → 4080.06] days later he
[4080.06 → 4080.68] rose again
[4080.68 → 4081.34] from the dead
[4081.34 → 4082.36] defeating sin
[4082.36 → 4082.88] and death
[4082.88 → 4083.96] forever in
[4083.96 → 4084.32] this world
[4084.32 → 4085.14] and all we
[4085.14 → 4085.88] need to do
[4085.88 → 4086.96] is believed
[4086.96 → 4087.96] in what he
[4087.96 → 4088.52] accomplished
[4088.52 → 4089.38] in his
[4089.38 → 4089.86] life in
[4089.86 → 4090.26] his death
[4090.26 → 4090.48] and in
[4090.48 → 4091.08] his resurrection
[4091.08 → 4091.98] and know
[4091.98 → 4092.42] that our
[4092.42 → 4093.20] salvation is
[4093.20 → 4094.40] assured not
[4094.40 → 4094.84] by anything
[4094.84 → 4095.70] we do but
[4095.70 → 4096.44] by everything
[4096.44 → 4097.50] he did and
[4097.50 → 4098.08] by everything
[4098.08 → 4098.76] he is going
[4098.76 → 4099.32] to do
[4099.32 → 4101.76] and when we
[4101.76 → 4102.54] rest in that
[4102.54 → 4104.32] truth when we
[4104.32 → 4105.10] sit in the
[4105.10 → 4106.24] persistent faith
[4106.24 → 4107.02] knowing that
[4107.02 → 4107.60] that gospel
[4107.60 → 4108.30] truth is just
[4108.30 → 4109.58] that truth
[4109.58 → 4111.82] changes everything
[4111.82 → 4113.54] no matter our
[4113.54 → 4114.02] context
[4114.02 → 4116.62] it gives peace
[4116.62 → 4117.14] to those who
[4117.14 → 4117.50] mourn
[4117.50 → 4119.80] it gives rest
[4119.80 → 4120.24] to those who
[4120.24 → 4121.04] battle every
[4121.04 → 4121.38] day
[4121.38 → 4123.48] it gives hope
[4123.48 → 4124.94] to those who
[4124.94 → 4125.40] have nothing
[4125.40 → 4127.50] it gives love
[4127.50 → 4127.98] to those who
[4127.98 → 4128.62] feel alone
[4128.62 → 4131.66] being persistently
[4131.66 → 4132.72] faithful allows
[4132.72 → 4133.52] all of us to
[4133.52 → 4134.04] remember that
[4134.04 → 4135.34] justice is
[4135.34 → 4135.70] coming
[4135.70 → 4137.64] peace is
[4137.64 → 4138.08] coming
[4138.08 → 4140.06] harmony is
[4140.06 → 4140.46] coming
[4140.46 → 4142.18] Jesus is
[4142.18 → 4142.54] coming
[4142.54 → 4145.44] and while
[4145.44 → 4145.90] this parable
[4145.90 → 4146.84] doesn't tell us
[4146.84 → 4147.38] why Jesus
[4147.38 → 4148.10] seems to move
[4148.10 → 4149.06] slowly sometimes
[4149.06 → 4150.84] it reminds us
[4150.84 → 4151.62] to be prayerful
[4151.62 → 4152.36] and live every
[4152.36 → 4153.04] day faithfully
[4153.04 → 4153.48] for him
[4153.48 → 4154.12] not just
[4154.12 → 4154.80] Sundays from
[4154.80 → 4155.68] 10 to 1130
[4155.68 → 4156.58] but every
[4156.58 → 4156.86] day
[4156.86 → 4159.10] on our peaks
[4159.10 → 4159.64] and in our
[4159.64 → 4160.00] valleys
[4160.00 → 4162.18] and we can do
[4162.18 → 4163.04] that because we
[4163.04 → 4164.10] can be confident
[4164.10 → 4164.84] that God
[4164.84 → 4165.90] will act for
[4165.90 → 4166.76] the good of
[4166.76 → 4167.64] those who
[4167.64 → 4168.00] love him
[4168.00 → 4168.78] he is coming
[4168.78 → 4169.46] so let's be
[4169.46 → 4170.30] persistent
[4170.30 → 4171.30] in our
[4171.30 → 4171.60] faith
[4171.60 → 4171.90] amen
[4171.90 → 4173.66] let me pray
[4173.66 → 4178.70] father in
[4178.70 → 4179.00] heaven
[4179.00 → 4181.14] we thank you
[4181.14 → 4181.62] for your
[4181.62 → 4182.00] redemption
[4182.00 → 4182.58] plan
[4182.58 → 4184.80] solidified in
[4184.80 → 4185.18] the life
[4185.18 → 4185.60] death and
[4185.60 → 4186.34] resurrection of
[4186.34 → 4186.96] Jesus Christ
[4186.96 → 4187.42] your son
[4187.42 → 4190.02] we thank you
[4190.02 → 4190.74] for this parable
[4190.74 → 4191.62] challenging us
[4191.62 → 4192.14] that no matter
[4192.14 → 4192.80] where we find
[4192.80 → 4193.38] ourselves in
[4193.38 → 4193.60] life
[4193.60 → 4195.02] that we are
[4195.02 → 4195.40] to remain
[4195.40 → 4196.36] faithful to
[4196.36 → 4196.66] you
[4196.66 → 4198.38] persistently
[4198.38 → 4199.48] faithful to

[4199.74 → 4201.60] and God

[4201.90 → 4202.20] God of
[4202.20 → 4202.60] all things
[4202.60 → 4202.96] you can
[4202.96 → 4203.24] change
[4203.24 → 4203.78] contexts
[4203.78 → 4204.46] you don't
[4204.46 → 4204.94] change other
[4204.94 → 4205.46] contexts
[4205.46 → 4205.96] you see
[4205.96 → 4206.46] all things
[4206.46 → 4206.86] and know
[4206.86 → 4207.42] all things
[4207.42 → 4208.26] let us
[4208.26 → 4208.88] trust you
[4208.88 → 4210.92] when things
[4210.92 → 4211.94] are bad
[4211.94 → 4212.26] in our
[4212.26 → 4212.50] lives
[4212.50 → 4212.78] may we

[4214.96 → 4215.32] when things
[4215.32 → 4215.66] are good
[4215.66 → 4216.14] may we
[4216.14 → 4216.88] glorify you
[4216.88 → 4217.30] and thank
[4217.30 → 4217.54] you
[4217.54 → 4218.08] and God
[4218.08 → 4218.48] in all
[4218.48 → 4218.66] of it
[4218.66 → 4218.92] may we
[4218.92 → 4219.44] acknowledge

[4243.28 → 4244.80] need
[4244.80 → 4245.72] more
[4245.72 → 4246.34] than
[4246.34 → 4246.70] you
[4247.62 → 4248.94] need

[4422.20 → 4423.98] for some coffee and refreshments afterwards
[4423.98 → 4426.48] enjoy some fellowship with one another
[4426.48 → 4428.66] but as we leave this place and go out into our week
[4428.66 → 4431.52] let's remember to remain faithful to our God
[4431.52 → 4433.42] when things are good, when things are bad
[4433.42 → 4434.30] in all situations
[4434.30 → 4435.92] dust off that Bible at home
[4435.92 → 4438.60] pray to him, invite him into all your context
[4438.60 → 4440.00] as he is our Lord
[4440.00 → 4442.86] Please receive God's parting blessing
[4442.86 → 4444.96] found from Numbers 6
[4444.96 → 4448.26] The Lord bless you and keep you
[4448.26 → 4450.80] The Lord make his face shine upon you
[4450.80 → 4451.90] and be gracious to you
[4451.90 → 4454.22] The Lord turn his face towards you
[4454.22 → 4455.90] and give you his peace
[4455.90 → 4457.46] And all God's people said
[4457.46 → 4458.40] Amen
[4458.40 → 4462.02] Amen
[4462.02 → 4491.72] We're pilgrims on the journey
[4491.72 → 4495.38] of the narrow road
[4495.38 → 4498.94] and those who've gone before us
[4498.94 → 4501.90] lie in the way
[4501.90 → 4505.84] cheering on the faithful
[4505.84 → 4509.42] encouraging the weary
[4509.42 → 4513.18] their lives a stirring testament
[4513.18 → 4518.78] to God's sustaining grace
[4518.78 → 4524.50] surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses
[4524.50 → 4528.38] let us run the race
[4528.38 → 4531.78] not only for the prize
[4531.78 → 4537.10] but as those who've gone before us
[4537.10 → 4540.68] let us lead to those behind us
[4540.68 → 4544.40] the heritage of faithfulness
[4544.40 → 4548.40] pass on through godly life
