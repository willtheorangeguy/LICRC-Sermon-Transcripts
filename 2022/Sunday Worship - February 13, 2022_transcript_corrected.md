[18.82 → 25.84] My love, my love, my love, my love, my love.
[25.84 → 35.98] But Show people, they make me don't like.
[35.98 → 39.78] And who for you or?
[39.78 → 53.24] Has he said anything to you?
[55.08 → 57.36] He's always on top
[57.36 → 60.84] He's away, babe
[60.84 → 65.48] He's never late
[65.48 → 70.54] It doesn't matter how long it takes
[70.54 → 74.36] He always comes out on time
[74.36 → 77.24] Lift your hands in worship
[77.24 → 80.10] We worship you
[80.10 → 83.90] Lift your hands, let's sing it to him
[83.90 → 85.72] John Star, come on, away may go
[85.72 → 86.54] Yeah
[86.54 → 100.28] One more time of your life
[100.28 → 102.70] God is there

[107.60 → 112.98] Like a light
[112.98 → 117.04] Lift your hands
[117.04 → 120.52] No one knows
[120.52 → 124.72] Taxi Max knows
[124.72 → 128.08] What he's done for me
[128.08 → 130.12] I don't know about you
[130.12 → 133.18] I don't know about you
[133.18 → 136.16] But that's why I praise him the way I do
[136.16 → 139.60] You can lie down
[139.60 → 141.36] You can jump up
[141.36 → 142.92] You can cry
[142.92 → 146.42] But I just want to surprise him
[146.42 → 154.34] Come on
[154.34 → 157.50] God is there

[486.08 → 488.80] My beloved
[488.80 → 492.58] The more beautiful
[492.58 → 495.70] The more thousand
[495.70 → 507.40] Good morning, everyone!
[508.72 → 510.50] Welcome to church this morning.
[510.62 → 512.70] It's good to see so many of you here.
[513.08 → 515.80] It's nice to be joined online by so many of you there.
[516.20 → 517.56] My name is Kevin Robert.
[517.64 → 520.26] I'm the youth pastor here at Emanuel CRC,
[520.26 → 524.36] and it is great to gather together in God's name this morning.
[524.52 → 528.70] I've got a couple of announcements this morning before we begin.
[529.14 → 531.42] First, I'm up here, not Pastor Chris.
[531.58 → 536.32] He's away right now slaying some demons or orcs or something,
[536.44 → 539.70] and so you're going to have me now up front for the service,
[539.84 → 541.90] and it's a joy to always be able to do that with you.
[542.66 → 544.36] A few announcements for the church.
[544.92 → 547.94] Perhaps you noticed in the bulletin or in the midweek memo,
[548.02 → 549.24] we showed a video last week.
[549.30 → 551.38] We are going to participate this year, once again,
[551.44 → 553.18] in the coldest night of the year.
[553.78 → 555.52] And so that is a morning,
[555.76 → 557.52] actually, no, it's usually an evening, I think,
[557.58 → 559.72] where we get together, and we raise some money
[559.72 → 561.94] throughout the month, and we join together as a team
[561.94 → 562.86] and then go on a walk
[562.86 → 564.62] to support the Gateway of Hope,
[564.88 → 566.74] which is a ministry just down the road from us
[566.74 → 569.18] that helps out the least of these.
[569.18 → 571.98] And so we would love for you to join that team.
[572.06 → 573.28] There's information in the bulletin
[573.28 → 574.52] and the midweek memo to do that.
[574.78 → 577.70] You can also chat with any of the office staff
[577.70 → 578.98] or to my wife, Nikki,
[579.36 → 581.28] and she can help with that as well.
[581.76 → 584.46] An announcement on behalf of Mexico.
[584.46 → 586.42] If you are heading to Mexico in a month,
[586.72 → 588.56] you've been raising money, which is great.
[588.62 → 590.56] You've done this Neufeld Farms fundraiser,
[590.60 → 591.26] which is awesome.
[591.64 → 593.96] You need to get your money in today.
[594.40 → 596.90] So all of your forms and payment need to get in today,
[596.90 → 598.52] and you can give them to Josh Chamberlain,
[598.52 → 599.40] who's coming today,
[599.78 → 601.86] or put it in Brandon Moeller's mailbox.
[602.16 → 603.08] But that is due today,
[603.18 → 604.10] so make sure to get that in.
[604.70 → 607.08] And finally, if you are a youth
[607.08 → 608.80] and planning on coming to HCBC,
[608.98 → 610.12] we have changed the time today.
[610.18 → 611.86] We are going to do that right after church this morning.
[612.04 → 613.34] So stick around.
[613.62 → 614.60] We'll have some lunch for you.
[614.66 → 616.14] We're going to do that at noon today.
[616.28 → 618.22] So come on out for that as well.
[619.44 → 622.08] Why don't you all rise this second,
[622.08 → 623.00] this moment,
[623.30 → 626.52] and receive God's greeting this morning.
[626.52 → 631.36] God's greeting this morning comes from Revelation 1,
[631.48 → 632.48] where it says,
[633.54 → 634.86] grace and peace to you,
[635.12 → 638.70] from him who is and who was and who is to come,
[639.04 → 641.78] and from the seven spirits before his throne,
[642.36 → 643.74] and from Jesus Christ,
[643.92 → 645.26] who is the faithful witness,
[645.66 → 646.98] the firstborn of the dead,
[647.30 → 649.78] and the ruler of the kings of the earth.
[649.78 → 651.46] And all God's people said,
[652.40 → 652.66] Amen.
[652.66 → 656.66] Our call to worship this morning
[656.66 → 658.18] comes from Psalm 86,
[658.34 → 659.20] verses 8 to 10.
[659.62 → 661.94] There is none like you, O Lord,
[662.20 → 664.36] nor are there any works like yours.
[664.76 → 666.42] All the nations you have made
[666.42 → 668.76] shall come and bow down before you, O Lord,
[668.98 → 670.74] and shall glorify your name.
[671.06 → 673.60] For you are great and do wonderful things.
[673.90 → 675.68] You alone are our God.
[675.68 → 687.56] Blessing and honour,
[688.06 → 689.84] glory and power,
[690.40 → 693.80] be unto the ancient of days.
[694.36 → 696.64] From every nation,
[697.18 → 698.90] all creation,
[699.54 → 702.68] bow before the ancient of days.
[702.68 → 706.86] Every tongue in heaven and earth
[706.86 → 708.66] shall declare your glory,
[708.84 → 711.70] every knee shall bow at your throne.
[712.02 → 716.54] In worship you will be exalted, O God,
[716.92 → 721.06] and your kingdom shall not pass away,
[721.06 → 724.22] all ancient of days.
[727.42 → 729.20] Blessing and honour,
[729.74 → 731.50] glory and power,
[731.50 → 735.68] be unto the ancient of days.
[735.68 → 738.48] From every nation,
[739.00 → 740.80] all creation,
[741.42 → 744.74] bow before the ancient of days.
[745.74 → 748.92] Every tongue in heaven and earth
[748.92 → 750.62] shall declare your glory,
[750.84 → 753.66] every knee shall bow at your throne.
[754.00 → 758.46] In worship you will be exalted, O God,
[758.46 → 762.64] and your kingdom shall not pass away,
[762.64 → 766.34] O ancient of days.
[768.38 → 773.76] O kingdom shall reign over all the earth,
[773.76 → 778.44] sing unto the ancient of days.
[778.44 → 783.18] For none can compare to your matchless word,
[783.38 → 786.70] sing unto the ancient of days.
[786.70 → 790.88] Every tongue in heaven and earth,
[790.88 → 791.20] every tongue in heaven and earth,
[791.20 → 793.04] shall declare your glory,
[793.04 → 796.10] every knee shall bow at your throne.
[796.10 → 800.82] In worship you will be exalted, O God,
[800.82 → 804.88] and your kingdom shall not pass away,
[804.88 → 808.04] O ancient of days.
[808.04 → 817.48] Father in heaven,
[817.48 → 834.22] how we love you.
[834.22 → 841.86] We lift your name in all the earth.
[841.86 → 847.90] May your kingdom be established in our praises.
[847.90 → 855.40] As your people declare your mighty works,
[855.40 → 862.40] Blessed be the Lord God Almighty,
[862.40 → 869.90] Who as it is and is to come.
[869.90 → 876.78] Blessed be the Lord God Almighty,
[876.78 → 888.84] Father of mercy,
[888.84 → 891.10] Father of mercy be exalted.
[891.10 → 899.10] May Jesus' name be lifted high.
[899.10 → 905.28] For the sacrifice of love has won my pardon,
[905.28 → 912.78] And His resurrection power gives me life.
[912.78 → 919.24] Blessed be the Lord God Almighty,
[919.24 → 933.24] Blessed be the Lord God Almighty,
[933.24 → 940.58] Who reigns forevermore,
[940.58 → 947.88] Blessed be the Lord God Almighty,
[947.88 → 975.88] Who reigns forevermore,
[975.88 → 977.88] And His resurrection power.
[977.88 → 983.64] Please take a moment to sit as we enter into a time of prayer.
[983.64 → 986.38] Through our liturgical practices of gathered worship,
[986.38 → 988.50] we enter into a time of confession,
[988.50 → 993.06] which invites us to speak words that are remarkably honest about our sins,
[993.06 → 998.36] words that don't always come so easily in our relationship with God.
[998.36 → 1001.58] As we engage in these liturgical practices here together,
[1001.58 → 1003.74] we are equipping ourselves to bring these practices
[1003.74 → 1007.12] into our everyday experiences of life.
[1007.12 → 1010.62] Join us as we enter into a time of silent confession,
[1010.62 → 1012.74] honestly speaking of our sins before God.
[1012.74 → 1013.74] Amen.
[1013.74 → 1014.74] Amen.
[1014.74 → 1015.74] Amen.
[1015.74 → 1016.74] Amen.

[1019.74 → 1020.74] Amen.
[1020.74 → 1021.74] Amen.
[1021.74 → 1022.74] Amen.

[1027.74 → 1028.74] Amen.
[1028.74 → 1029.74] Amen.
[1029.74 → 1030.74] Amen.
[1030.74 → 1031.74] Amen.
[1031.74 → 1032.74] Amen.
[1032.74 → 1033.72] Amen.
[1033.72 → 1036.72] Amen.
[1036.72 → 1037.72] Amen.
[1037.72 → 1038.72] Amen.
[1038.72 → 1039.72] Amen.
[1039.72 → 1040.72] Amen.
[1040.72 → 1041.72] Amen.
[1041.72 → 1042.72] Amen.
[1042.72 → 1043.72] Amen.
[1043.72 → 1044.72] Amen.
[1044.72 → 1046.72] Amen.
[1046.72 → 1047.72] Amen.
[1047.72 → 1048.72] Amen.
[1048.72 → 1051.72] Amen.
[1051.72 → 1052.72] Amen.
[1052.72 → 1053.72] Be sober-minded.
[1053.72 → 1055.72] Be watchful.
[1055.72 → 1061.72] Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.
[1061.72 → 1068.82] devour. Resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same kind of suffering are being experienced
[1068.82 → 1074.90] by your family of believers throughout the world. And after you have suffered a little while,
[1075.60 → 1081.24] the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore,
[1081.24 → 1088.60] confirm, strengthen, and establish you. To him be the dominion forever and ever. Amen.
[1091.72 → 1113.42] Great is thy faithfulness, O God my Father.
[1113.42 → 1129.42] There is no shadow of turning with thee. Thou changes not, thy compassions they fail not.
[1129.42 → 1145.42] As thou hast been, thou forever wilt be. Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[1145.42 → 1162.24] Morning by morning new mercies I see. All I have needed, thy hand hath provided.
[1162.24 → 1171.24] Great is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me.
[1173.24 → 1188.42] Summer and winter and springtime and harvest, sun, moon, and stars in their courses above.
[1188.42 → 1197.42] Join with all nature in manifold witness.
[1197.42 → 1205.42] To thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.
[1205.42 → 1213.42] Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[1213.42 → 1230.42] Morning by morning new mercies I see. All I have needed, thy hand hath provided.
[1230.42 → 1238.42] Great is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me.
[1238.42 → 1240.42] God bless you.
[1240.42 → 1250.42] Pardon for sin and a peace that endured.
[1250.42 → 1259.42] Thine own dear presence to cheer and to guide.
[1259.42 → 1261.42] Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow.
[1261.42 → 1266.42] Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow.
[1266.42 → 1272.42] Blessings all mine with ten thousand beside.
[1272.42 → 1284.42] Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[1284.42 → 1288.42] Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[1288.42 → 1306.42] Morning by morning new mercies I see. All I have needed, thy hand hath provided.
[1306.42 → 1319.42] Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me.
[1319.42 → 1323.42] Join us by standing in our song if you are able.
[1323.42 → 1342.42] I cry now for your hand of mercy to heal me.
[1342.42 → 1361.42] I am weak. I need your love to free me.
[1361.42 → 1371.42] O Lord, my rock, my strength in weakness.
[1371.42 → 1379.42] Come rescue me, O Lord.
[1379.42 → 1380.42] You are my heart.
[1380.42 → 1389.42] You are my heart. Your promise never fails me.
[1389.42 → 1398.42] And my desire is to follow you forever.
[1398.42 → 1399.42] For you are good, O Lord, my God.
[1399.42 → 1420.42] For you are good, O Lord, for you are good, for you are good to me.
[1420.42 → 1430.42] I cry now for your hand of mercy to heal me.
[1430.42 → 1439.42] I am weak. I need your love to free me.
[1439.42 → 1448.42] O Lord, my rock, my strength in weakness.
[1448.42 → 1456.42] Come rescue me, O Lord.
[1456.42 → 1457.42] You are my heart.
[1457.42 → 1466.42] You are my heart. Your promise never fails me.
[1466.42 → 1475.42] And my desire is to follow you forever.
[1475.42 → 1484.42] For you are good, for you are good, for you are good to me.
[1484.42 → 1494.42] For you are good, for you are good, for you are good to me.
[1494.42 → 1515.42] For you are good, for you are good, for you are good to me.
[1515.42 → 1536.42] You may be seated.
[1536.42 → 1537.42] You may be seated.
[1537.42 → 1539.42] For me is a pleasure to have you seated.
[1539.42 → 1540.42] I will let you stand up.
[1540.42 → 1541.42] For you are good, O Lord, my God.
[1541.42 → 1542.42] Good morning.
[1542.42 → 1543.42] Thank you.
[1543.42 → 1544.42] Good morning.
[1544.42 → 1545.42] Good morning.
[1545.42 → 1564.42] Can everybody hear me okay?
[1564.42 → 1569.12] Okay, today's offering is for Emanuel Ministries and Budget.
[1570.06 → 1573.14] The special offering is for the Langley Food Bank.
[1573.84 → 1578.04] They serve many people, including families, two times per week.
[1578.90 → 1581.48] During COVID, many people lost their jobs,
[1582.00 → 1584.94] and there was quite an increase of people coming for food.
[1585.66 → 1590.20] At the same time, the number of donations increased,
[1590.20 → 1597.86] and the people who serve at the Langley Food Bank were amazed at God's provision when they needed it most.
[1598.88 → 1604.06] Throughout the Bible, God talks about finances a lot.
[1605.00 → 1611.04] One reason is the way we use money reveals so much about our spiritual commitment.
[1611.04 → 1621.52] But also because God loves the poor and wants His people to show a compassionate and sympathetic heart toward them.
[1622.52 → 1625.28] Leviticus 19, verses 9 to 10.
[1626.00 → 1627.86] Make provision for the poor.
[1628.72 → 1634.56] When you reap the harvest of your land, do not reap to the very edges of your field.
[1634.56 → 1641.22] Do not go over your vineyard a second time, or pick the grapes that have fallen.
[1642.28 → 1644.80] Leave them for the poor and the foreigner.
[1645.62 → 1647.26] I am the Lord your God.
[1647.26 → 1648.26] Amen.
[1664.56 → 1665.56] Amen.
[1677.14 → 1677.62] Amen.
[1677.62 → 1681.78] Amen.
[1681.84 → 1682.24] Amen.
[1682.24 → 1686.66] Amen.
[1686.66 → 1687.38] Amen.
[1687.38 → 1688.02] Amen.
[1688.02 → 1688.92] Amen.
[1689.00 → 1689.64] Amen.
[1689.82 → 1690.34] Amen.
[1690.34 → 1690.38] Amen.
[1690.38 → 1690.60] Amen.
[1690.88 → 1691.48] Amen.
[1691.48 → 1691.58] Amen.
[1691.58 → 1692.54] Amen.
[1692.54 → 1693.04] Amen.
[1693.04 → 1693.60] enough.
[1693.60 → 1694.22] Amen.
[1694.22 → 1724.20] Thank you.
[1724.22 → 1754.20] Thank you.
[1754.22 → 1784.20] Thank you.
[1784.22 → 1814.20] Thank you.
[1814.20 → 1815.20] Hey guys, welcome to church.
[1815.28 → 1816.24] Nice to see you again.
[1817.14 → 1818.32] You already have things to say.
[1818.44 → 1820.26] Can I ask a few questions of you guys first?
[1820.40 → 1822.38] And then we're going to go to children's worship time.
[1823.68 → 1828.20] Hey, do you guys ever, are you guys ever afraid of anything?
[1828.32 → 1832.20] Anything you really don't like having around?
[1832.28 → 1833.18] What do you have in your mind?
[1833.18 → 1834.18] What do you think, Malachi?
[1834.18 → 1837.00] Oh, the dark and clouds?
[1837.70 → 1837.94] Yeah.
[1838.56 → 1839.22] Oh, clouds.
[1839.84 → 1842.36] Yeah, well, let's not get started on...
[1842.36 → 1843.26] What do you think, Malachi?
[1845.90 → 1846.22] Dogs?
[1846.32 → 1847.66] Sometimes dogs can be a little bit scary.
[1847.72 → 1848.30] What do you think, Zoe?
[1848.80 → 1854.12] Oh, the dark in your bedroom.
[1854.12 → 1854.50] I know.
[1855.24 → 1856.96] Yeah, that sometimes you get a bad dream.
[1857.12 → 1857.86] What do you think, Haley?
[1860.42 → 1861.40] Oh, bad dreams.
[1861.50 → 1861.76] I know.
[1861.84 → 1863.24] Nobody likes a bad dream, right?
[1863.32 → 1863.94] I had a friend.
[1864.02 → 1865.62] She was really scared of rabbits.
[1867.06 → 1868.30] What would make a good dream?
[1869.54 → 1871.06] Oh, bless your heart.
[1871.06 → 1873.80] Thank you if I would make a good dream.
[1873.92 → 1875.48] That's nice of you to say.
[1876.22 → 1876.38] Yeah.
[1877.96 → 1879.70] Oh, a candy cane dream.
[1879.80 → 1880.40] Good one.
[1880.58 → 1880.88] Yeah.
[1881.72 → 1883.50] You know, sometimes I'm afraid of step two.
[1883.62 → 1887.62] I was afraid that I'd planned the wrong children's message for today.
[1888.16 → 1888.82] So that...
[1888.82 → 1889.52] But don't worry.
[1889.64 → 1890.16] Don't worry.
[1890.24 → 1891.46] We got it straightened out.
[1891.78 → 1892.42] So that went okay.
[1892.66 → 1894.12] And I have someone in my family.
[1894.24 → 1896.16] They're terrified of snakes.
[1897.10 → 1897.54] Right?
[1897.68 → 1898.20] Not good.
[1898.28 → 1898.82] I won't say.
[1898.82 → 1899.42] I won't say.
[1900.34 → 1901.18] Cool candy.
[1906.08 → 1906.76] Oh, yeah.
[1906.90 → 1907.18] Snakes.
[1907.28 → 1908.24] They can be pretty tricky.
[1908.90 → 1910.90] Any other thoughts, Allie?
[1911.84 → 1912.48] Pardon me.
[1913.20 → 1913.96] You love snakes.
[1914.14 → 1914.74] You know what?
[1914.76 → 1916.00] That's a great thing to say.
[1916.10 → 1919.80] Sometimes things we're scared of, really, we don't need to be so scared of them.
[1920.10 → 1923.06] So we're going to talk about that more in children's worship time today.
[1923.26 → 1925.26] We have a little science experiment to do.
[1925.26 → 1931.72] And then we're going to talk about why we really don't need to be afraid of some of the things we are sometimes afraid of.
[1932.34 → 1932.54] Okay.
[1932.58 → 1933.98] Well, let's do the children's blessing first.
[1934.12 → 1936.78] And then we will go off to children's worship time.
[1938.18 → 1938.98] Let's stand.
[1939.08 → 1940.74] And the congregation can stand with us.
[1941.48 → 1942.20] Arms up.
[1944.26 → 1944.70] Ready?
[1944.70 → 1947.26] The Lord be with you.
[1949.64 → 1950.06] All right.
[1950.12 → 1951.52] Let's go into children's worship time.
[1951.52 → 1951.92] All right.
[1954.18 → 1955.68] All right.
[1955.86 → 1955.96] Let's stand.
[1956.88 → 1957.20] All right.
[1957.26 → 1958.60] Let's stand.
[1962.78 → 1966.82] All right.
[1971.88 → 1972.80] Let's stand.
[1972.88 → 1973.02] All right.
[1973.02 → 1973.42] All right.
[1973.42 → 1973.62] All right.
[1973.62 → 1974.00] Let's ask.
[1974.04 → 1974.14] All right.
[1974.14 → 1993.16] I'm Eric Hubert, an elder here at Emmanuel CRC, and I'll lead you in our church family prayer.
[1994.16 → 1999.20] I lift my eyes up to the mountains. Where does my help come from? My help comes from the Lord,
[1999.20 → 2004.34] the maker of heaven and earth. He will not let your foot slip. He will watch over you and will
[2004.34 → 2010.98] not slumber. Indeed, he who watches Israel will neither slumber nor sleep. The Lord watches over
[2010.98 → 2017.56] you. The Lord is your shade at your right foot. The sun will not harm you by day, the moon by night.
[2018.10 → 2023.76] The Lord will keep you from harm. He will watch over your life. The Lord will watch your coming
[2023.76 → 2030.38] and going now and forevermore. Lord, at this time, we pray for some of the situations around the world,
[2030.86 → 2035.46] in particular right now, Ukraine with the possibility of war. We pray for everyone's safety,
[2035.90 → 2040.40] that the leaders of both these countries would come to be a peaceful resolution and that war
[2040.40 → 2045.70] would be avoided. We pray for all levels of government around the world as we continue
[2045.70 → 2051.94] to deal with the ongoing COVID situation around the world. We pray that those infected the virus
[2051.94 → 2058.54] will recover soon. We also think of the people who are struggling with other ailments. Please bring
[2058.54 → 2064.16] healing and comfort where needed. For those who care for the family members with illnesses,
[2064.68 → 2071.34] we pray for a measure of grace and strength. Bless the work of our health workers. It has been a
[2071.34 → 2075.62] difficult task working very long hours. We pray for their daily encouragement for them,
[2075.88 → 2081.58] and they would get the rest they need in their days off. Lord, you know our spring break mission team
[2081.58 → 2085.96] will be leaving next month. Bless the fundraising and planning for the youth and the leaders going.
[2086.30 → 2091.96] We pray that you will keep them healthy so they can go on their trip and prepare the hearts of those
[2091.96 → 2099.08] in Mexico they will be meeting. We also think of Jody and Ariel and their ministry. Help them be your light
[2099.18 → 2106.18] to those they minister to. We also think of our Emmanuel team walkers participating in this year's
[2106.18 → 2113.44] the coldest night walk on February 26, raising awareness and funds to support the work of the gateway of hope,
[2113.82 → 2119.78] serving the hungry, hurting, and homeless in Langley. Let their walk bring awareness and financial support
[2119.78 → 2126.28] where it is needed for this cause. We pray and thank you for all the levels of leadership and volunteers
[2126.28 → 2133.46] here at Emmanuel. I appreciate the time they put in serving your people. Give us the grace. We work
[2133.46 → 2140.84] together with unity in times of decision-making. Rejoice in the Lord always. I say it again, rejoice.
[2140.84 → 2145.68] Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near. Amen.
[2156.28 → 2176.30] We are going to jump right into our text today, which is going to continue on our series in Exodus.
[2176.30 → 2182.92] We're going to open our Bibles to Exodus chapter 12 and read verses 31 to 42. Like I mentioned,
[2182.92 → 2188.64] we've been going through this series in Exodus for the last month and a half, a half. The last few
[2188.64 → 2194.24] weeks we've looked at the plagues. Last week, Pastor Chris talked about the final plague, the Passover
[2194.24 → 2199.60] and the death of the firstborn of every house in Egypt. And today we're going to look at what
[2199.60 → 2206.50] Pharaoh's response was to especially that final plague. And it's the story of the beginning of the
[2206.50 → 2211.02] Exodus. So if you've got your Bibles, open them up with you. If you're at home, please do the same.
[2211.02 → 2217.68] The verses will be on the screen behind me as well. And read with me chapter 12, verses 31 to 42.
[2218.82 → 2219.44] There we read,
[2220.20 → 2224.06] During the night, Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said,
[2224.60 → 2230.62] Up, leave my people, you and the Israelites. Go worship the Lord as you have requested.
[2231.14 → 2235.90] Take your flocks and herds as you said and go. And also bless me.
[2235.90 → 2241.60] The Egyptians urged the people to hurry and leave the country, for otherwise they said,
[2241.70 → 2247.74] We will all die. So the people took their dough before the yeast was added and carried it on their
[2247.74 → 2254.90] shoulders in kneading troughs wrapped in clothing. The Israelites did as Moses instructed and asked the
[2254.90 → 2261.58] Egyptians for articles of silver and gold and for clothing. The Lord had made the Egyptians favourably
[2261.58 → 2267.14] disposed towards the people, and they gave them what they asked for. So they plundered the Egyptians.
[2268.26 → 2274.60] The Israelites journeyed from Ramses to Succoth. There were about 600,000 men on foot besides women
[2274.60 → 2281.02] and children. Many other people went with them, and also large droves of livestock, both flocks and herds.
[2281.30 → 2285.50] With the dough the Israelites had brought from Egypt, they baked loaves of unleavened bread.
[2285.50 → 2291.44] The dough was without yeast because they had been driven out of Egypt and did not have time to
[2291.44 → 2299.14] prepare food for themselves. Now the length of time the Israelite people lived in Egypt was 430 years.
[2299.94 → 2307.52] At the end of 430 years to the very day, all the Lord's divisions left Egypt. Because the Lord kept
[2307.52 → 2312.60] vigil that night to bring them out of Egypt, on this night all the Israelites are to keep vigil
[2312.60 → 2319.36] in honour and to honour the Lord for the generations to come. The word of the Lord.
[2321.68 → 2329.00] One of the best commercials I have seen in recent memory had to do with his buddy. He was calling his
[2329.00 → 2332.64] friend on the phone. He was very excited. Furthermore, he called his friend and said, hey, I just got an email from a
[2332.64 → 2338.64] Nigerian prince. The prince is in trouble. He needs my help. He's got a small fortune he's trying to get out
[2338.64 → 2343.46] of the country. But for bureaucratic reasons, he can't do that. And so for a small sum of $500,
[2343.90 → 2348.44] I'll send him to secure the transfer, and then he's going to pay me a hundred grand for helping.
[2349.88 → 2353.06] This friend on the line sounded a bit annoyed. He's like, dude, I got the same email.
[2354.72 → 2359.28] And his buddy says, well, you know what that means. And his buddy's like, yeah, we're going to be rich.
[2359.58 → 2361.68] And they both started jumping up and down. They were very excited.
[2361.68 → 2365.66] But it's a hilarious commercial. It's actually a terrible commercial because for the life of me,
[2365.72 → 2370.78] I cannot remember what they were like advertising for. Like I cannot Dr. Pepper, maybe. I don't know.
[2371.46 → 2378.10] Insurance, Tupperware, it doesn't matter. The point is we can roll our eyes at that because these guys
[2378.10 → 2387.04] succumb to the big scam that had swept the nations about 10 years ago. The Nigerian prince scam is a tale
[2387.04 → 2393.34] as old as time. And while it's easy for us to roll our eyes at that, perhaps, the thing is we are all hurt
[2393.34 → 2397.24] by broken promises. These guys were about to be hurt by a promise made by some Nigerian prince.
[2397.88 → 2402.94] But we're all hurt by broken promises. They suck. Broken promises suck. We've been hurt by friends.
[2403.02 → 2409.48] We've been hurt by family because of promises people didn't keep to us. I'll always be there for you,
[2409.48 → 2416.54] they say, and then they're not. I won't tell anyone. Then they do. I'll call you later.
[2417.48 → 2421.44] Then they don't. We make promises to ourselves, actually, that hurt us as well. I'll get in shape
[2421.44 → 2432.00] soon. Nope. I won't tell anyone. And then we do. I'll stop drinking. Yeah, really? I'll study tomorrow.
[2432.40 → 2438.74] That one gets me still. We see it with money. We're promised if we invest in this stock or in that
[2438.74 → 2443.12] portfolio, things will be great. And then depressions or recessions hit, and our investments fall through
[2443.12 → 2449.12] and we're left with nothing or at least a lot less than we were promised. More than that, our world
[2449.12 → 2454.14] promises us that if we just have that one more thing, if we just have that one more thing, we'll be happy.
[2454.32 → 2459.98] You just need that house. You just need that yard, that car, that hot tub, that game, that phone,
[2460.36 → 2466.32] that... and you fill in the blank. You get that, you'll be happy. Say, advertisements everywhere.
[2466.32 → 2473.14] And then, of course, there's the biggest broken promise that is just dividing our culture right
[2473.14 → 2481.16] now. Till death do us part. Divorce rates have climbed steady for the last 22 years and as of
[2481.16 → 2486.58] 2021, 40% of Canadian marriages end in divorce. In America, that number is over 50%.
[2486.58 → 2494.00] A flip side of that coin, we look at singleness as a problem that needs solving rather than a lifestyle
[2494.00 → 2498.52] that we should celebrate. We promise single people in our lives, if you get married, life will get better.
[2500.36 → 2502.32] And yet the statistics show otherwise, don't they?
[2504.34 → 2509.72] But for single people, the promise of a future spouse fuels their hope. And ironically, for half of
[2509.72 → 2517.10] married people out there, the promise of becoming single again fuels theirs. To be put our hope in
[2517.10 → 2522.62] these promises, these promises of ourselves, these promises of others, or our marital status, or our
[2522.62 → 2530.22] wealth, but these promises get shattered, and they leave us lost and hurt and staggering around.
[2532.10 → 2536.60] I'm going to double down on this one more time to make it for our current context here.
[2536.60 → 2542.64] Some of us are currently putting our hope in a government, a government promising that they will
[2542.64 → 2549.26] keep us safe and well. We put our hope in that. On the other side, there's some of us that are putting
[2549.26 → 2553.56] our hope in a trucker's convoy, thinking that we're going to get our rights and freedoms back by them,
[2553.66 → 2560.48] freedoms and rights that we suppose we've lost. And you know what? Some of you are going to be very
[2560.48 → 2568.16] disappointed in those promises. All of us are putting our hope in promises somewhere.
[2569.44 → 2579.04] Our hope in some promise. But the problem is, our hope cannot be put in the promises of man.
[2579.66 → 2584.80] Time and time again, these man-made promises, they are proven to become fickle. Our hope,
[2584.80 → 2591.36] they must be rooted in the promises of God. And that's what this text today is all about.
[2592.64 → 2601.60] God's promises have to be our hope because God's word stands. The promises of God are the only
[2601.60 → 2607.22] promises that we can put our hope in because anything else will leave us empty. And while it
[2607.22 → 2612.66] might be hard to see at first glance, this text today is all about God's promises. There's a bunch of
[2612.66 → 2617.86] promises fulfilled in those 12 verses today, and we're going to look at three of them. Each one of
[2617.86 → 2622.80] those promises point to Christ, and each one of those promises continues to be true for each one of us
[2622.80 → 2628.38] today. So, promise number one. The first promise we're going to look at is that all the Israelites
[2628.38 → 2635.56] will leave the land rich. Way back in Genesis 15 verse 14, God says, he says this, he says,
[2635.56 → 2641.90] he will punish the nation that enslaves his people, and his people will come away with great possessions.
[2642.66 → 2649.64] Well, in verse 35 and 36 of our text today, this comes true. They're told to leave, and as they leave,
[2650.00 → 2655.70] they ask the Egyptians for gold and silver, and the Egyptians just give it to them.
[2656.90 → 2663.18] This is the easiest pillaging of a nation in the history of man. The Egyptians just give them their
[2663.18 → 2667.34] gold and silver, letting the Israelites walk away with a tremendous amount of wealth.
[2667.34 → 2675.66] God kept his promise to the Israelites, and they plundered the Egyptians by simply asking them.
[2677.04 → 2681.78] God wanted to make sure that his people left with gifts, gifts of gold and gifts of silver,
[2681.92 → 2686.96] wealth that they could use on their journey to build things, trade with, start a nation with.
[2688.50 → 2696.82] God saved his people from the bondage of the Egyptians, and he vacated them from Egypt with gifts.
[2697.34 → 2707.80] Thousands of years later, Jesus does the same, and he vacates the grave with gifts for his people.
[2707.88 → 2713.16] You see, God's people, they were still in captivity. They just weren't in captivity to the Egyptians,
[2713.44 → 2718.66] but to their own sinfulness. They were stuck in it. Furthermore, they were mired in the ways of this world,
[2718.66 → 2726.00] and they couldn't get out. And so Jesus, he came into the world, and he lived a life worthy of being
[2726.00 → 2733.62] called the righteous one. And then he took all of God's sin, or all of people's sin, God placed on
[2733.62 → 2738.44] Jesus. I got to get that sentence right. That's really important. He took all of mankind's sin
[2738.44 → 2743.76] and placed it on Jesus' shoulders, where he took it to the cross, and he died,
[2743.76 → 2749.92] and he relieved the world of the sin and shame. He then rose again from the grave,
[2750.24 → 2756.50] freeing his people from the bondage of sin and death forever, and he gave them gifts of forgiveness,
[2756.98 → 2765.18] of love, of grace, and of mercy. Gifts that are so much greater than gold or silver. Jesus freed his
[2765.18 → 2770.98] people from captivity, and he didn't simply save us, but he gave us gifts of love,
[2771.66 → 2779.86] so that we, like the Egyptians, can leave our captivity rich. Proverbs 8, 19 says,
[2780.22 → 2785.48] God's gifts are better than gold, and what God gives surpasses choice silver.
[2787.86 → 2791.74] Maybe sometimes it's hard to wrap our heads around. This is all Christians, perhaps,
[2791.74 → 2795.62] if you've heard this over and over again. I mean, I'm not going to lie. I'd take some gold or silver
[2795.62 → 2800.10] in my life. Wouldn't mind paying off a little bit of the mortgage. You talk to any 20-something in our
[2800.10 → 2805.26] church, I bet you they would too. It's hard to get a down deposit in this economy we find ourselves in.
[2806.26 → 2814.08] But gold, silver, those things are finite. Money comes and goes. When we get it, we save it,
[2814.08 → 2822.40] or we spend it, and then we want more. We always want more. And then you die, and all of that is meaningless.
[2823.96 → 2830.16] Whatever figurative gold or silver you've stored up or spent, it means nothing in the midst of eternity.
[2831.92 → 2838.42] But God's gifts of grace, that's eternal. His mercy is forever. His love is endless.
[2838.42 → 2844.48] And once you have it, you have it forever, for eternity. It never goes away. Jesus came to offer
[2844.48 → 2852.50] you an eternity of sinless, pain-free, joy-filled life in the new heaven and the new earth. And he
[2852.50 → 2859.46] came to save you from the captivity that binds us all, to take away our sin, our fears, our anxieties,
[2859.62 → 2868.20] all the traumas and the pain, the worry, the grief, all of that. To have all of that removed is priceless.
[2868.20 → 2874.08] You can't pay your way out of anxiety. Money can't keep you from pain.
[2876.10 → 2882.44] Sin lurks within wealth. But an eternal life because of grace, mercy, forgiveness,
[2883.34 → 2889.38] it trumps gold and silver every time. Like the Israelites, God promised that you will leave this
[2889.38 → 2897.36] land, this sinful world, rich, rich in love and mercy and grace, rich beyond anything this world can
[2897.36 → 2904.90] offer. And we know that that is true because God's word stands. That was promise number one.
[2905.00 → 2910.44] Promise number two. Promise number two in this text was that God's people would become a great nation.
[2911.30 → 2917.64] Again, way back in Genesis 12, God says to Abraham, I will make you a great nation. He said that to one
[2917.64 → 2924.38] person. Well, Abraham had a son named Isaac. Isaac had a son named Jacob. Jacob then had 12 sons,
[2924.38 → 2930.24] one of which was Joseph. And it was those 12 sons with their wives and their kids that settled down
[2930.24 → 2939.40] in Egypt 400 years later. They were a group of about 70 people, a family of 70. And they settled
[2939.40 → 2944.36] down in Egypt. Well, how big did this family of 70 get? Well, our text tells us. Verse 37 of our text
[2944.36 → 2952.48] today says that there was about 600,000 men on foot besides women and children. If you simply
[2952.48 → 2958.00] doubled that number, assumed that there's the same amount of women as men, you're at 1.2 million.
[2959.40 → 2964.44] Sprinkle in some kids and being aware that this is a different culture than we are in right now,
[2964.48 → 2970.48] and people didn't just have one. Most scholars agree that conservatively, there would have been at
[2970.48 → 2979.06] least two and a half million Israelites leaving Egypt. Two and a half million people. That is a lot
[2979.06 → 2985.22] of people. Out of the 195 countries that exist in our world right now, 88 of them have fewer people
[2985.22 → 2993.36] than that. 2.5 million people is the population of Chicago. Or to Canadianize that for you, it's Calgary
[2993.36 → 3000.46] twice over. It's Vancouver four times. It's the city of Langley 100 times. This is not a small group
[3000.46 → 3007.14] of people. This is a giant nation of people. I think when we see movies on the Exodus, or maybe we
[3007.14 → 3013.14] picture things in our kids' children's Bibles, I don't think we truly grasp the scope of how big
[3013.14 → 3019.28] this nation was, and how major and miraculous this whole event was. And honestly, how miraculous the
[3019.28 → 3026.38] next 40 years of the Israelites' existence is going to be. There's this guy, his name's Dr. Danny
[3026.38 → 3031.36] Vellum. He's a headmaster of a Christian academy, the Donaldson Christian Academy, and he was curious
[3031.36 → 3037.02] when he heard how big this nation was. So he met with, he's in the States, he met with an American
[3037.02 → 3041.20] quartermaster general of the army. So the guy that's in charge of like the logistics of the army.
[3041.60 → 3047.78] And he met with him, and he asked some questions about how you would maintain a group that large
[3047.78 → 3052.68] in the wilderness. And so according to them, these are the numbers that this quartermaster general
[3052.68 → 3057.60] said. Now I've converted all the units to the metric system because the imperial system is
[3057.60 → 3064.40] nonsense. But they said this, here are some numbers. They said they had to cross the Sea of Reeds in one
[3064.40 → 3069.48] night. And I think we're going to get to the story next week. If they went in a narrow path like you
[3069.48 → 3075.12] see in the movies, two by two across the Red Sea, or the Sea of Reeds, that line would have had to be
[3075.12 → 3082.52] 1,200 kilometres long, and it would have taken them 35 days to cross. So there had to be an opening in
[3082.52 → 3090.34] the sea, five kilometres wide, so 5,000 people could walk, like abreast, 5,000 people abreast could
[3090.34 → 3094.74] walk through it to make it through in one night. When they were in the wilderness, the people would
[3094.74 → 3101.08] have needed, according to this guy, two million kilograms of food each day. To bring in that much
[3101.08 → 3105.84] food, in today's perspective, they would have needed a freight train that's five kilometres long
[3105.84 → 3113.56] every day. In the wilderness, they needed firewood to keep warm, to cook, to boil their water. Each
[3113.56 → 3117.26] day, it's estimated by this quartermaster that they would have needed three and a half million
[3117.26 → 3123.76] kilograms of wood. That's another freight train, but this one's 10 kilometres long. This one blew my
[3123.76 → 3128.48] mind. They needed water, of course. Now, granted, they probably stumbled on water here and there, but
[3128.48 → 3133.94] they needed water. They needed a lot of it. If they only had enough to drink and maybe cook and wash a few
[3133.94 → 3143.10] things, they would have needed 50 million litres of water each day. Buckle up. That's a freight train
[3143.10 → 3150.54] with, like, those water-carrying tank cars that's 2,900 kilometres long. That's here to Winnipeg,
[3151.02 → 3157.36] down Highway 1. That's how far that train is. Now, finally, each time they camped that night, they would
[3157.36 → 3164.02] have needed a space roughly 2,000 square kilometres to set up camp that's a little bit bigger than the
[3164.02 → 3171.70] Hawaiian island of Maui, or, to Canadianize it, half of Prince Edward Island. My brain can't actually
[3171.70 → 3176.78] compute that. It has a hard time wrapping around those numbers, and some of you might want to
[3176.78 → 3180.98] challenge that. Maybe they didn't need two million kilograms of food. Maybe they needed one kilogram.
[3180.98 → 3185.94] That actually doesn't matter. The point is, it's not eight kilograms of food. A jumbo pack of meat
[3185.94 → 3193.62] from Costco wouldn't have done them. They needed a lot. That's how big this nation got. That's how
[3193.62 → 3200.18] much stuff they needed, and that's what they needed to rely on their God for each and every day in the
[3200.18 → 3209.30] wilderness. The Exodus wasn't this little walk out of Egypt. This was a ginormous mass of 2.5 million
[3209.30 → 3219.34] people up and leaving Egypt to rely on God for food, for water, and all necessities in the wilderness.
[3220.00 → 3226.38] I can barely keep track of my three daughters at a grocery store. I can't imagine 2.5 million people
[3226.38 → 3230.26] in the wilderness, but God promised they would be a great nation, and a great nation they became,
[3230.46 → 3237.20] and that growth did not stop there. The story continues, and they eventually settle in a new land.
[3237.20 → 3241.84] Over the next couple of thousand years, they conquer, and they grow, and then they get conquered.
[3242.82 → 3247.52] Then all the while, God is watching his people, and he's with their circumstances, and while everything
[3247.52 → 3253.18] changes, these people sin, and they go into exile, but God is there, and he is watching.
[3255.44 → 3261.42] And then Jesus comes, and he comes not only to save his people, but he comes to save the whole cosmos,
[3261.42 → 3266.18] and he lives this life according to the will of God the Father, and he takes on those sins,
[3266.42 → 3273.22] not just for his people, but for the entire world. He takes on the entire world's sin.
[3275.08 → 3279.50] Those who have come before, and those who have yet to come, and then he dies, and he takes all of that
[3279.50 → 3285.96] to the grave with them, and he rises back to life on the third day, and he redefines the parameters
[3285.96 → 3293.26] of this great nation once and for all. No more are they a nation defined by the borders of Israel,
[3293.46 → 3299.78] but they are a people designed, or defined, sorry, by a shared faith in Jesus. No more are they people
[3299.78 → 3304.70] defined by the mark of circumcision, like the Old Testament said, but they are a people defined by
[3304.70 → 3311.64] the mark of baptism. No more are they a people defined by the family blood of Abraham that runs
[3311.64 → 3318.02] through their veins. They are a people defined by the calcific blood that Jesus poured out for
[3318.02 → 3325.08] everyone who calls him their Lord. This great nation got even greater through Jesus Christ.
[3325.40 → 3329.28] Romans 8, 9 says, it is not the children by physical descent who are God's children,
[3329.58 → 3335.54] but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham's offspring. Galatians 3, 29,
[3335.74 → 3341.08] if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise. You see,
[3341.08 → 3346.72] this great hope that we have is that we are not in this life alone. God promised his people that
[3346.72 → 3352.44] they would become a great nation, and we continue to grow and become great. Now we live in this world
[3352.44 → 3358.98] where churches span continents, where no race and no language separates the body of Christ, and we can
[3358.98 → 3365.18] look forward to the day, as Revelation 7, 9 says, where a great multitude, where no one can count,
[3365.18 → 3372.64] from every nation and tribe and people and language will stand before the throne and before the Lamb.
[3373.86 → 3381.14] And in this world, where maybe we feel often isolated, where we feel alone because we have been
[3381.14 → 3390.82] stranded, where we've been hurt by broken promises, if we lean on this promise of God, and we know that
[3390.82 → 3396.38] there is a community out there, a community of believers here for you, that can change the tide,
[3396.46 → 3401.86] that can make the difference. Hebrews 12 talks about this cloud of witnesses.
[3403.46 → 3407.72] And I think rightfully, we look at that cloud, and we think of people that we know who have died before
[3407.72 → 3413.10] us, our grandparents perhaps, people we love and know. But I think by doing that, we sometimes minimize
[3413.10 → 3420.02] this cloud of witnesses. This cloud is massive. It's billions of people strong.
[3422.10 → 3429.20] And you are part of that community. You are part of that body. You're part of this church.
[3430.50 → 3436.96] Lean into the blessings of God, this promise that you are a part of a great nation, because God's word
[3436.96 → 3437.64] stands.
[3437.64 → 3446.52] Finally, the third promise we'll look at today. God promised that his people would be a blessing to
[3446.52 → 3451.48] all nations. Again, back in Genesis 12, God says to Abraham, I will make your name great, and you will
[3451.48 → 3460.30] be a blessing, and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you. Our text shows two examples of
[3460.30 → 3467.08] this being fulfilled. First, Pharaoh, after persevering through all ten plagues, he finally listens to God,
[3467.08 → 3471.98] and he caves, and he tells Moses and the Israelites, you guys go, get out of here. But not before one
[3471.98 → 3478.34] last request that he makes. He makes that in verse 32 of our text. He says, go, take your flocks and your
[3478.34 → 3489.06] herds, and go, and also bless me. And bless me, he says. Remember, in Egypt, Pharaoh was considered a god,
[3489.06 → 3498.12] and yet this god, this pharaoh god, now looked to the one true god, and he asked to be blessed by him.
[3500.46 → 3507.46] Pharaoh had become an enemy of God. Well, enemies of God become enemies of themselves, and sooner or
[3507.46 → 3515.50] later, they are made to see that. Well, this was Pharaoh seeing that, and at that moment, whether it was fear,
[3515.50 → 3522.94] or humility, or an honest realization, he knew who God was, and he asked to be blessed by him.
[3524.54 → 3529.16] The second example from my text is verse 38. It's just a little line in there, but it's really important.
[3529.90 → 3536.16] We read there that many other people left with them, meaning a non-Israelite, a diverse crowd,
[3536.30 → 3542.82] up and left with them too. Non-Israelites saw what was happening, and they wanted in. They wanted to be a
[3542.82 → 3550.48] part of that. Verse 38. This is reinforced, actually, in the verses immediately following
[3550.48 → 3555.74] our text today. In the verses immediately following our text, instructions are given on how to include
[3555.74 → 3560.72] these non-Israelite people into their traditions. Instructions on how to include these people
[3560.72 → 3564.04] so that they could join in the celebration of the Passover.
[3564.04 → 3569.98] God's people were going, and they were going to be a blessing to all nation.
[3571.20 → 3575.68] As part of this great nation now, as part of this church, this is our calling as well.
[3576.62 → 3579.72] This third promise is actually the culmination of the first two.
[3580.84 → 3585.80] God promises to give us gifts, which we received from Jesus in the form of grace, mercy, forgiveness,
[3585.80 → 3591.56] and love. And he promised that we are a great nation, one of his children, this body of believers,
[3591.68 → 3597.60] this church. And now his church, with these gifts, we are to go and to be a blessing to those around us.
[3599.18 → 3604.18] God has been fulfilling that promise throughout history. Just look at schools and hospitals,
[3604.44 → 3610.20] shelters and charities, areas of engineering or science or business, all of them, and many more,
[3610.20 → 3615.28] have been impacted and started even by Christ followers throughout history.
[3616.98 → 3620.64] We are called to be a blessing to those around us.
[3623.44 → 3627.80] Bob Coffey wrote this book called Love Does, and in this book he tells this story. I think it's
[3627.80 → 3632.86] quite fascinating. He said that him and his wife were on vacation, and they were out touring sort of
[3632.86 → 3637.60] the west coast of America. And one night they pulled into this small town. It was late. They pulled into
[3637.60 → 3642.04] this small town, and they went into the hotel, and they booked a room, and then they talked to the
[3642.04 → 3645.96] concierge. And the concierge was super nice. He was super nice to them. He's like, oh yeah, welcome to
[3645.96 → 3649.44] town. It's so good to see you. You know, and they asked him questions, and he said, oh there's this
[3649.44 → 3653.20] beautiful restaurant just down the way. If you're hungry, head there. Good prices, good people, check
[3653.20 → 3657.08] it out. So they're like, oh the concierge is super nice. Let's listen to him. And so they went. They went to
[3657.08 → 3661.00] that restaurant. They were hungry. Furthermore, they went to the restaurant, and they had a server there, and the server served them
[3661.00 → 3667.34] their food and their drinks. And he was very nice too, very chatty. He gave them all sorts of
[3667.34 → 3671.44] stuff, gave them tips, talked about his family history, stuff. They had a lovely time for dinner, and then
[3671.44 → 3676.24] he suggested, why don't you go downtown and walk the boardwalk by the water? It's lovely there. And so
[3676.24 → 3680.28] they did. They listened to him too. They went down by, and they met this girl. She was a musician sitting
[3680.28 → 3684.04] on the street. She looked to be quite well off though, but she was just playing, and they listened, and they
[3684.04 → 3688.74] enjoyed the music. And then they talked to her, and learned a bit about her story, and gave her a little
[3688.74 → 3693.26] bit of money for playing music, and were really blessed by her as well. And you know, they chatted up. She was super
[3693.26 → 3697.22] nice. They went back to their hotel, went to bed, got up the next morning,
[3697.22 → 3701.94] and continued on their way. As they were driving, they met some other people, and they said, oh, we
[3701.94 → 3707.70] were just in that small town. The people there are lovely. It is such a nice town. And then they
[3707.70 → 3711.58] continued on, and Bob Goff, he realized, he talked to his wife about this after. He's like, we actually
[3711.58 → 3717.52] have no idea if that town's nice. We know that those three people were. Those were the only three people
[3717.52 → 3724.44] we met in that town, and yet those three people affected our opinion of that town. And now in our minds,
[3724.44 → 3732.62] that's known as the nice town. There are people in this world that will only know Jesus because of
[3732.62 → 3740.20] you and maybe one or two others. Their opinion on being a Jesus follower has to do with their run-ins
[3740.20 → 3747.24] with two or three people, and you might be one of them. In fact, I dare say you are all one of them
[3747.24 → 3753.20] in someone's life, and they will base their opinions on our Lord and Saviour on their interactions with
[3753.20 → 3761.42] you and a few others. So the question is, what is their opinion of Jesus going to be based on their
[3761.42 → 3767.88] interactions with you? We are called to be a blessing to all nations. Jesus is going to make that true.
[3767.88 → 3773.58] Will you join him in that? I'm going to conclude with this, so stay with me here for this last
[3773.58 → 3778.50] little bit. I think sometimes we hear a message like this, and maybe we think, sure, it seems like
[3778.50 → 3783.22] a bit of a stretch, though. A random 12 verses in the middle of this narrative in Exodus, and you're
[3783.22 → 3789.08] going to connect it to three promises of God made 400 years earlier, and then to Jesus Christ who came
[3789.08 → 3795.64] 2,000 years later. Seems like a stretch. Seems like you might be reaching a bit. But the thing is,
[3795.64 → 3801.22] it's not. It's not reaching at all. That's the beauty of this story, and I don't just mean this
[3801.22 → 3805.76] story of the passage that we read today. I don't even mean this book of Exodus story. I mean the
[3805.76 → 3813.20] whole grand narrative of Scripture, the Bible, everything in that book points to Jesus, and Jesus
[3813.20 → 3820.90] is the culmination of God's promises and his redemption plan. See, the danger is not to look at a text like
[3820.90 → 3825.62] this and think it's a stretch to connect it to Christ and the gospel truth found in him three times.
[3825.64 → 3832.64] No. The danger is becoming so complacent with the promises of God in our lives that we forget
[3832.64 → 3840.88] their power. We forget their majesty. We forget how vital God's promises are to our lives each and
[3840.88 → 3849.74] every week, each and every day. We forget how important Jesus' life, death, resurrection are
[3849.74 → 3859.08] to our eternal lives. And we gloss over a story like this, not realizing that this is a perfect example
[3859.08 → 3868.04] about how God has come through for us time and time again. And so yes, this is a story that reveals God
[3868.04 → 3874.90] gave the Israelites gift as they left Egypt, but it should also emphasize the gift of love, forgiveness,
[3874.90 → 3881.58] mercy, and grace that he gives you from the cross and the empty tomb. God promises you all of these
[3881.58 → 3889.20] things, and all you need to do is accept them. Yes, this story today, it teaches us about how God's people
[3889.20 → 3895.76] grow to become this great nation, but it should remind you that you are part of an even greater nation
[3895.76 → 3901.30] that goes beyond borders, beyond race, beyond gender, beyond tongue, beyond relation.
[3902.62 → 3908.20] And now God's people, all of us, serve alongside one another and provide a community for each other
[3908.20 → 3910.34] so that no one should feel alone.
[3912.34 → 3918.12] And yes, this story today, it shows us how God's people became a blessing to the surrounding nations,
[3918.12 → 3925.74] but it should remind us that we are called to do the same. God has granted you mercy,
[3926.68 → 3936.50] so go and be merciful. God has forgiven our sins, so go and forgive. God has given us grace,
[3936.76 → 3946.58] so go and be gracious. God has given us love, so go and love others. God promises that his church
[3946.58 → 3951.48] will bless the nations, so go and be a part of that promise.
[3953.12 → 3958.46] And if complacency in any of these promises has settled into your heart, if any of this seems
[3958.46 → 3965.84] old and repetitive or mundane, please spend some time with God today in prayer. Ask the Holy Spirit
[3965.84 → 3973.00] to reveal the might, the majesty, the magnitude of these promises, because they're not just some
[3973.00 → 3982.08] mundane words on a page. These are life-changing promises. And they're the only promises worth putting
[3982.08 → 3989.08] our hope in, because God's word stands. Amen. Let me pray.
[3989.08 → 4001.64] Father in heaven, we read a story like this. We see how you have fulfilled promises in these Israelites' lives.
[4002.32 → 4009.72] We see how you saved them from their captivity. And God, sometimes we look at that as just a cool story.
[4009.72 → 4017.76] But God, those promises still reign true today, and they reign in each of our lives. Lord, forgive us when we put
[4017.76 → 4024.42] our hope in things that are made of man, not made of you. Forgive us when we lean into things that we desire
[4024.42 → 4030.52] and forget to look at what it is you desire from us. And God, will you allow the promises in this text
[4030.52 → 4037.26] and throughout the word to resonate in our hearts? Let us know that we are rich in you because of your love
[4037.26 → 4043.50] and grace and mercy. Let us know that we are part of a great nation, this community that you have placed us in.
[4043.78 → 4050.42] And may we take those two promises and fulfill the third. May we go out and be a blessing to those around us.
[4050.70 → 4055.30] Teach us to love more. Teach us to be more forgiving. Teach us to be more gracious.
[4055.88 → 4060.52] Teach us to show more mercy. Allow us to become more and more like you, we pray.
[4061.78 → 4063.14] In Jesus' name, amen.
[4067.26 → 4093.58] You unravel me with a melody. You surround me with a song.
[4093.58 → 4108.12] I've delivered us from my enemies till all my fears are gone.
[4108.12 → 4123.20] I'm no longer a slave to fear. I am a child of God.
[4123.58 → 4138.68] I'm no longer a slave to fear. I am a child of God.
[4138.68 → 4163.90] In my mother's womb, you have chosen me. Love has called my name.
[4163.90 → 4193.88] I've been born again.
[4193.88 → 4195.88] I'm no longer a slave to fear. I am a child of God.
[4195.88 → 4223.86] I'm no longer a slave to fear. I am a child of God.
[4223.86 → 4225.86] I'm no longer a slave to fear. I am a child of God.
[4225.86 → 4230.86] I am a child of God.
[4230.86 → 4237.86] I am a child of God.
[4237.86 → 4247.86] I am a child of God.
[4247.86 → 4264.86] I am a child of God.
[4264.86 → 4272.62] You split the sea so I could walk right through it.
[4273.10 → 4277.22] My fears were drowned in perfect love.
[4280.00 → 4286.30] You rescued me so I could stand and sing.
[4286.30 → 4292.38] I am the child of God.
[4294.86 → 4301.54] You split the sea so I could walk right through it.
[4302.10 → 4306.36] My fears were drowned in perfect love.
[4308.42 → 4315.22] You rescued me so I could stand and sing.
[4315.22 → 4321.22] I am the child of God.
[4321.22 → 4327.96] I am the child of God.
[4328.46 → 4335.90] Yes, I am the child of God.
[4335.90 → 4343.14] I am the child of God.
[4343.14 → 4350.14] I am the child of God.
[4350.14 → 4353.88] I am the child of God.
[4353.88 → 4357.38] I am the child of God.
[4357.38 → 4369.62] I am the child of God.
[4369.62 → 4370.62] I am the child of God.
[4370.62 → 4374.36] I am the child of God.
[4374.36 → 4375.86] I am the child of God.
[4375.86 → 4376.46] I am the child of God.
[4376.46 → 4382.96] So let us go forth from this place into this week knowing that truth that we are no longer slaves to fear,
[4383.52 → 4384.68] slaves to sin,
[4385.32 → 4387.84] slaves to anything the devil wants to put in our way,
[4387.94 → 4390.40] but we are children of God.
[4391.06 → 4392.80] We are rich in his love.
[4392.80 → 4394.70] We are a great community,
[4394.90 → 4395.74] a great nation,
[4395.74 → 4399.08] and we are called to go and bless those around us.
[4399.12 → 4403.50] Now hear God's parting blessing from Numbers chapter 6.
[4404.64 → 4407.06] The Lord bless you and keep you.
[4407.76 → 4411.50] The Lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[4411.94 → 4416.04] The Lord turn his face toward you and give you his peace.
[4417.04 → 4417.94] God's people said,
[4419.00 → 4419.24] Amen.
[4419.24 → 4419.36] Amen.
[4419.36 → 4419.38] Amen.
[4422.80 → 4424.44] Amen.
[4424.44 → 4427.08] He's our rescuer.
[4427.94 → 4430.46] He's our rescuer.
[4431.40 → 4436.26] We are free from sin forevermore.
[4436.84 → 4439.86] Oh, how sweet the sound.

[4461.18 → 4465.82] There is good news for the doubter
[4465.82 → 4469.30] The one religion failed

[4503.38 → 4506.08] Riches for the poor
[4506.08 → 4511.08] He is friendship for the one the world ignores
[4511.08 → 4515.90] He is master for the weary
[4515.90 → 4519.12] Rest for those who strive
[4519.12 → 4524.44] For the good Lord is the way, the truth, the life
[4524.44 → 4530.96] Yes the good Lord is the way, the truth, the life
[4530.96 → 4535.78] He's our rescuer

[4560.72 → 4568.54] Come to the foot of Calvary
[4568.54 → 4570.54] There is redemption
[4570.54 → 4571.54] There is redemption
