• Reflecting on a story from Mark 14 about Jesus and a woman who anointed him with expensive perfume
• The focus is on Passion Sunday, not Palm Sunday or the kingship of Jesus
• In the liturgical calendar, "passion" refers to the love of Jesus for his people that led him to the cross
• The story in Mark 14 occurred a few days after Jesus' entry into Jerusalem and is likely set on Tuesday night or Wednesday afternoon
• The importance of understanding this event as actual history, rather than just a myth or story
• The supreme value of Jesus outweighs all other things of worth in life
• Anticipating objections that the pastor's perspective may be biased or arrogant
• The importance of specificity in a story
• Mark's use of specific details to emphasize the historical truth of the story
• The significance of Bethany and Simon the leper's home as the location for the events
• The meaning behind Simon being referred to as "Simon the leper"
• The consequences of having leprosy in ancient times, including social isolation and ceremonial uncleanness
• The implications that Simon was probably cured of his leprosy at some point
• The Gospel of Mark describes a specific individual who was wealthy, well-connected, and had leprosy but was healed.
• This description is meant to highlight the person's significance and authenticity, as someone with such characteristics would be known and remembered.
• The markers of specificity in the story, including the person's identity and circumstances, are intended to challenge readers to fact-check the account.
• If the first part of the story is true, then the second part must also be true, which includes a woman's extravagant gift of expensive perfume to Jesus.
• The worth of the perfume, valued at over a year's wages, is mentioned in both Mark and John's Gospel, with the Greek text specifying it was worth 300 denarii.
• The speaker is making an analogy between a "luxury item" and a Tesla, emphasizing that it's not just a small purchase but a significant investment.
• The speaker discusses the cost of living wage in Vancouver and compares it to more than a minimal yearly salary.
• The text being referenced has a woman who is unnamed, leading to debate about why she isn't named.
• The speaker argues against the idea that the woman's lack of naming is due to patriarchal bias, citing examples of women mentioned by name in the Gospels.
• The unnamed woman in the text is praised by Jesus for her actions
• Her actions are deemed more valuable than those of others present
• She is a foil to highlight the assumptions and ignorance of those in power
• She reveals their lack of understanding of Jesus' true nature and mission
• Her actions demonstrate that she has a deeper understanding of Jesus and his purpose
• The speaker argues that her anonymity increases the shame of those around her who should know better
• Worship and offerings in church

• Connecting giving to worship and trusting in God's providence
• Automatic giving through direct deposit as a convenient option
• Worship as a rhythm of life
• The importance of giving to worship Jesus
• Competing priorities between serving the poor and worshiping Jesus
• The concept of "weaponized compassion" where good actions are used to control or manipulate others
• The idea that true worship is essential and cannot be excluded in favor of other good works
• The concept of compassion being used as a means to an end, rather than an inherent value
• The recognition that the worship of God is what provides for all things in life
• The supreme value of Jesus outweighing other values and responsibilities
• The importance of prioritizing one's relationship with Jesus over material wealth or social status
• The idea that Jesus' love drives him to bear the weight of sin on behalf of others, and his sacrifice on the cross is a demonstration of this love
• Jesus' anointing prepares him for his death
• The disciples didn't understand the significance of the anointing
• Worship is about being present and focused in times of uncertainty or adversity
• Being a follower of Jesus means being willing to face challenges and persecution
• The word "Christian" was initially used as an insult, implying that those who followed Jesus were anointed (Christ-like) and worthy of suffering.
• The word "Christian" originated as an insult, but its meaning has evolved to signify sharing in the anointing of Jesus.
• Being a Christian means sharing in Christ's anointing and doesn't necessarily mean living a good life or trying to be obedient to God.
• True Christianity is about worship and acknowledging one's need for a savior due to personal failure and imperfection.
• The supreme value of Jesus being true is essential because without it, people are left with only their own failures.
• The difference between attention-seeking behaviors and true worship
