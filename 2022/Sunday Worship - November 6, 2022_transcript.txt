[630.00 --> 633.26]  We'll try that again
[633.26 --> 634.80]  Good morning everyone
[634.80 --> 638.16]  We're still nestling into the comfy chairs
[638.16 --> 639.16]  Oh my shoes!
[639.34 --> 639.88]  Thanks Isla
[639.88 --> 641.72]  I'll bring those to the chair in a second
[641.72 --> 644.00]  It's good to see you all this morning
[644.00 --> 645.36]  Good to be here in church today
[645.36 --> 646.62]  My name is Kevin Lover
[646.62 --> 647.70]  And I'm one of the pastors here
[647.70 --> 648.94]  The youth pastor at this church
[648.94 --> 651.08]  And it's a joy to be here this morning
[651.08 --> 653.28]  Maybe some of you were here an hour early
[653.28 --> 654.26]  That's good
[654.26 --> 656.76]  You could take a nap on these super comfortable chairs
[656.76 --> 659.10]  We're super glad they came in a little bit early
[659.10 --> 660.64]  Which is awesome
[660.64 --> 660.94]  So
[660.94 --> 663.52]  A few announcements this morning
[663.52 --> 664.62]  Before we begin our service
[664.62 --> 666.08]  First of all, youth
[666.08 --> 667.46]  We have youth coffee today
[667.46 --> 669.24]  It'll be at Fran and John Skipper's house
[669.24 --> 671.06]  So you can head there after the service
[671.06 --> 672.20]  We'll hang out
[672.20 --> 672.78]  We'll have some food
[672.78 --> 673.54]  It'll be wonderful
[673.54 --> 674.72]  Hope to see you all there
[674.72 --> 678.14]  If you are a parent or a child
[678.14 --> 679.64]  Who is interested
[679.64 --> 681.70]  I mean the parents are interested for their children
[681.70 --> 682.60]  I should clarify that
[682.60 --> 684.50]  But if you're a child who's interested in singing
[684.50 --> 686.90]  In the choir this coming Christmas
[686.90 --> 689.32]  Rehearsals for that are going to start in two weeks
[689.32 --> 691.28]  And so if you are interested in doing that
[691.28 --> 693.58]  Please sort of circle that date in your calendar
[693.58 --> 694.54]  Two weeks today
[694.54 --> 696.10]  It'll be happening after the service
[696.10 --> 696.94]  You can talk to Mark
[696.94 --> 697.66]  Is Mark here?
[697.78 --> 698.58]  Mark's going to wave
[698.58 --> 700.38]  He was here
[700.38 --> 700.90]  He's running
[700.90 --> 701.42]  Oh there he is
[701.42 --> 701.88]  He's in the back
[701.88 --> 702.82]  See hey there's Mark
[702.82 --> 704.44]  Go talk to Mark about that
[704.44 --> 707.00]  We look forward to hearing all of the kids
[707.00 --> 708.80]  And the choir sing at Christmas time
[708.80 --> 709.66]  Finally
[709.66 --> 711.74]  There's been an announcement in the bulletin
[711.74 --> 712.70]  The past couple weeks
[712.70 --> 715.12]  About needing some jars
[715.12 --> 716.86]  For the gems ministry
[716.86 --> 718.52]  They're doing a cookie fundraiser
[718.52 --> 720.38]  To help with the gems camp this year
[720.38 --> 722.54]  They have sold a ton of gems jars
[722.54 --> 723.12]  Cookie jars
[723.12 --> 725.86]  But we need a bunch more mason jars
[725.86 --> 726.90]  If you have them
[726.90 --> 728.86]  So they are looking for either wide mouth
[728.86 --> 730.38]  Or regular mouth
[730.38 --> 732.16]  Court sized jars
[732.16 --> 733.08]  So if you have those
[733.08 --> 734.62]  You can bring them into the church in the next week
[734.62 --> 735.36]  That would be wonderful
[735.36 --> 738.42]  And then if you want to buy some cookies from them
[738.42 --> 739.66]  That would also be wonderful
[739.66 --> 741.40]  So I'm going to invite you all now
[741.40 --> 742.38]  To please stand
[742.38 --> 745.16]  And hear God's greeting this morning
[745.16 --> 750.78]  God's greeting this morning
[750.78 --> 752.56]  Comes from Revelation 1
[752.56 --> 753.34]  Where it says
[753.34 --> 755.18]  Grace and peace to you
[755.18 --> 756.46]  From him who is
[756.46 --> 757.62]  And who was
[757.62 --> 758.88]  And who is to come
[758.88 --> 760.58]  And from the seven spirits
[760.58 --> 761.78]  Before his throne
[761.78 --> 763.50]  And from Jesus Christ
[763.50 --> 765.30]  Who is the faithful witness
[765.30 --> 767.36]  The firstborn of the dead
[767.36 --> 768.56]  And the ruler
[768.56 --> 770.42]  Of the kings of the earth
[770.42 --> 772.04]  And all God's people said
[772.04 --> 772.96]  Amen
[772.96 --> 774.56]  Please take a moment to greet one another
[774.56 --> 775.30]  Those around you
[775.30 --> 775.42]  Amen
[775.42 --> 805.32]  Our calls to worship this morning
[805.32 --> 808.08]  Comes from 2 Samuel chapter 22
[808.08 --> 811.42]  The Lord is my rock
[811.42 --> 812.76]  My fortress

[818.50 --> 820.66]  And the horn of my salvation
[820.66 --> 822.84]  He is my stronghold
[822.84 --> 824.02]  My refuge
[824.02 --> 824.84]  And my savior
[824.84 --> 826.54]  For who is God
[826.54 --> 827.44]  Besides the Lord
[827.44 --> 829.38]  And who is the rock
[829.38 --> 830.58]  Except our God
[830.58 --> 832.12]  The Lord lives
[832.12 --> 833.90]  Praise be to the rock
[833.90 --> 835.76]  Exalted be my God

[839.66 --> 840.84]  Among the nations
[840.84 --> 842.60]  I will sing the praises
[842.60 --> 843.46]  Of your name

[1283.06 --> 1283.92]  Let's pray together.
[1283.92 --> 1290.02]  God, we can often be too busy or preoccupied,
[1290.50 --> 1294.20]  and we need reminders to take the time for what is important,
[1295.24 --> 1296.86]  our relationship with you.
[1298.24 --> 1300.72]  In a time now of silent prayer, Lord,
[1301.34 --> 1302.90]  we take time to be still
[1302.90 --> 1307.00]  and to be with you alone in a time of confession.
[1313.92 --> 1339.32]  Dear God, silence can be hard.
[1339.32 --> 1344.04]  Confession can be hard, and life can be hard.
[1344.96 --> 1346.46]  Faithful God, as believers,
[1346.84 --> 1350.88]  you promise to stay with us through all the difficult parts of life.
[1351.68 --> 1355.76]  You have heard our confessions and been with us in our silent prayers.
[1356.98 --> 1360.86]  For your forgiveness, faithfulness, and love, we are grateful.

[1366.64 --> 1371.08]  Please stand as we hear some more words of assurance.

[1376.70 --> 1378.30]  And the good news is this.
[1378.98 --> 1382.18]  The steadfast love of God never ceases.
[1383.16 --> 1385.84]  God's mercies never come to an end.
[1385.84 --> 1388.04]  They are new every morning.

[1390.86 --> 1391.86]  Amen.
[1415.84 --> 1421.46]  Just not let no questions be careful.

[1661.02 --> 1667.02]  What a majesty rules it just in

[1720.02 --> 1722.02]  What a glory consumes like fire
[1722.02 --> 1726.02]  What a glory consumes like fire
[1726.02 --> 1728.02]  What a glory consumes like fire

[1744.02 --> 1746.02]  Who cry and behold me, the wonder we are
[1746.02 --> 1750.02]  Who cry and behold me, the wonder we are
[1750.02 --> 1752.02]  Who cry and behold me, the wonder we are
[1752.02 --> 1754.02]  Who cry and behold me, the wonder we are

[1842.58 --> 1844.58]  The one here
[1844.58 --> 1846.58]  Who else would offer
[1846.58 --> 1848.58]  his only son
[1848.58 --> 1850.58]  Come and worship
[1850.58 --> 1852.58]  the Holy God
[1852.58 --> 1854.58]  And bless you

[1868.58 --> 1870.58]  I am
[1870.58 --> 1872.92]  See you
[1874.12 --> 1874.58]  forever
[1874.58 --> 1876.58]  With me
[1876.58 --> 1878.58]  Come and be holy
[1878.58 --> 1880.82]  Let's worship the Lord.
[1882.26 --> 1885.60]  Let's worship the Lord.
[1885.60 --> 1886.72]  Let's worship the Lord.
[1889.26 --> 1890.52]  You can have a seat.
[1908.58 --> 1910.56]  Good morning.
[1916.56 --> 1917.46]  Good morning.
[1918.10 --> 1918.88]  I'm Emil.
[1919.22 --> 1920.52]  I'm a deacon in the church.
[1921.28 --> 1924.82]  We continue our worship with the giving of our gifts.
[1925.18 --> 1930.40]  First of all, to the budget, which covers the administration of the church and its ministries,
[1930.92 --> 1935.42]  and the special offering, which is Seeds of Hope Children's Ministry.
[1935.42 --> 1945.20]  It was started in 1995 by an Abbotsford couple, Reverend John and Susan Chakias,
[1945.50 --> 1951.14]  after seeing the plight of children orphaned because of AIDS in Africa.
[1951.92 --> 1960.46]  In 1996, Seeds of Hope Children's Ministry opened the first home for HIV-AIDS-infected children in Thailand.
[1960.46 --> 1970.82]  Also in Thailand, at Nu Reign, HIV-infected and affected women who had been cast out from their families and society
[1970.82 --> 1972.88]  are able to live in a secure environment.
[1973.74 --> 1981.96]  These women receive love and hope through the mentorship program, a comfortable and secure home, medical care, and life skills.
[1981.96 --> 1989.26]  The goal is to empower the ladies to be able to one day safely integrate back into society.
[1990.18 --> 1996.06]  Most importantly, the ladies get to experience the love and gospel of Jesus Christ.
[1996.80 --> 2003.70]  Some of these women have children, and Rays of Hope provides for them as well by keeping the family together
[2003.70 --> 2006.96]  and making sure the children get to go to school.
[2008.40 --> 2018.86]  Seeds of Hope's biggest project is Grace Academy, a boarding school and home to over 170 orphaned children in Zambia.
[2019.76 --> 2028.00]  Grace Academy, also known as the Place of Grace, is where children are given a loving home, medical care, and good nutrition,
[2028.00 --> 2036.96]  which will break the cycle of poverty for the children by providing a high level of education and a mentoring program.
[2037.80 --> 2044.06]  Children that suffer from AIDS are given antiviral medication to improve their chances for a healthier life.
[2044.70 --> 2051.28]  The vision is to raise children to be the future leaders of their country and to impact their nation
[2051.28 --> 2055.66]  with the grace and love of Christ, which they have also received.
[2055.66 --> 2060.72]  We believe the way to do this is through education and opportunity.
[2061.82 --> 2067.70]  Seeds of Hope also has orphanages in Myanmar, which is previously known as Burma.
[2068.50 --> 2069.60]  Please give generously.
[2070.86 --> 2074.04]  One person gives freely, yet gains even more.
[2074.78 --> 2077.94]  Another withholds unduly, but comes to poverty.
[2078.82 --> 2080.54]  A generous person will prosper.
[2081.30 --> 2084.38]  Whoever refreshes others will be refreshed.
[2084.38 --> 2087.90]  Proverbs 11, 24, and 25.
[2089.74 --> 2093.94]  Next week's offering is for the Budget and Diaconal Ministries Canada.
[2093.94 --> 2123.92]  Thank you.
[2123.94 --> 2153.92]  Thank you.
[2153.94 --> 2155.94]  Thank you.
[2183.94 --> 2185.94]  Thank you.
[2213.94 --> 2215.94]  Thank you.
[2243.94 --> 2245.94]  Thank you.
[2273.94 --> 2275.94]  Thank you.
[2303.94 --> 2305.94]  Thank you.
[2305.94 --> 2307.94]  Thank you.
[2307.94 --> 2309.94]  Thank you.
[2309.94 --> 2311.94]  Thank you.
[2311.94 --> 2313.94]  Thank you.
[2313.94 --> 2314.94]  All right.
[2314.94 --> 2319.94]  Kids are already up, but if you haven't come up and you are age 3 up to grade 4, come on
[2319.94 --> 2321.94]  up.
[2321.94 --> 2325.46]  I thought it looked kind of empty here, but there's lots of kids here, which is really
[2325.46 --> 2325.86]  great.
[2329.36 --> 2336.22]  So today we are going to go off to our large group and learn more about God and God's story
[2336.22 --> 2336.88]  in the Bible.
[2337.50 --> 2343.00]  Before we do that, though, let's take a minute to pray together and then we will do the blessing.
[2343.00 --> 2348.82]  Lord God, thank you for this day and that we can come here to church, God, and that we
[2348.82 --> 2352.46]  can learn more about you and your great love for us that never ends.
[2352.94 --> 2358.36]  We pray that we would have open hearts and open ears to hear and learn today.
[2358.36 --> 2359.36]  Amen.
[2359.36 --> 2360.36]  Amen.
[2360.36 --> 2361.36]  All right.
[2361.36 --> 2362.36]  Let's stand up.
[2362.36 --> 2363.36]  Ready?
[2363.36 --> 2365.36]  The Lord has given me.
[2365.36 --> 2368.36]  All the Spirit is ready.
[2368.36 --> 2369.36]  The Lord has given me.
[2369.36 --> 2371.36]  And we are going to come to our Lord.
[2371.36 --> 2374.36]  And we are going to come to our Lord.
[2374.36 --> 2375.36]  Amen.
[2375.36 --> 2376.36]  Amen.
[2376.36 --> 2377.36]  Amen.
[2377.36 --> 2378.36]  Amen.
[2378.36 --> 2379.36]  Amen.
[2379.36 --> 2381.36]  Amen.
[2381.36 --> 2383.36]  Amen.
[2383.36 --> 2384.36]  Amen.
[2384.36 --> 2385.36]  Amen.
[2385.36 --> 2386.36]  Amen.
[2386.36 --> 2387.36]  Amen.
[2387.36 --> 2388.34]  Amen.
[2388.36 --> 2395.06]  Good morning, everyone. My name's Eric. I'm an elder here at the church.
[2397.36 --> 2402.02]  First I want to ask, how about those chairs? How are they? They're good? Not bad?
[2403.80 --> 2409.48]  Spent about 10 minutes sitting down. The rest of the morning we've been standing up, but they're still kind of comfortable, so that's all good.
[2410.30 --> 2415.32]  Just want to thank those who contributed to the chair fund to allow us to have these chairs here.
[2415.32 --> 2420.16]  They're really nice, and they look great in here, so thank you for those who've done that.
[2421.66 --> 2425.00]  Just a couple announcements before I get into the family prayer.
[2425.74 --> 2428.26]  Some of you may be wondering where Pastor Chris is this morning.
[2430.96 --> 2437.34]  He's in Abbotsford for the ordination of Ben Wimmers at Living Hope as the youth and family pastor there at that church.
[2437.82 --> 2442.24]  He'll be working with Steve Birkenpass, who's an alumni of here, of Emmanuel.
[2442.24 --> 2450.24]  We have just another announcement. We have an AGM congregational meeting coming up on November 23rd.
[2450.82 --> 2454.86]  That's a Wednesday night, so we're encouraging everyone to come and be a part of that.
[2454.96 --> 2459.48]  We're going to be talking a lot about the budget, so that would be good to have your input there.
[2460.30 --> 2464.48]  Packages will be emailed out, but if you wanted printed coffee, please contact the office.
[2464.48 --> 2471.74]  We have exciting news. Josh Chamberlain has been offered the position of the young adult, a ministry leader at the church,
[2471.74 --> 2477.82]  so he successfully passed all the tests, and we offered him the job, so that's exciting.
[2481.32 --> 2486.72]  We're excited to see what God has planned for you in this position over the months to come.
[2486.72 --> 2495.48]  A couple of other things. For some of you who are not aware, Stacy, we got word, or the Klosterhoffs got word early this week
[2495.48 --> 2502.90]  that Stacy's mom, Joan, had an aneurysm stroke this week, and she's not doing well,
[2503.04 --> 2509.58]  so our prayers go out to them as they prepare to go there to see her in the days to come.
[2509.58 --> 2517.52]  As well, we heard this morning from Kevin that Nikki and Jared's grandpa and Joan's dad passed away this week.
[2517.60 --> 2528.40]  His name's Tony. He lives in Penticton. He's in his 80s, late 80s, so prayers go out to that family as well as they mourn the loss there.
[2529.94 --> 2533.80]  Also, yesterday, if I know some of you were there at the Hanson funeral yesterday,
[2533.80 --> 2539.12]  we want to pray for the Hanson family through these difficult times ahead as they lost a brother and a son,
[2539.12 --> 2545.50]  a young man there, and he was an incredible man, so if you were there yesterday, that was quite something.
[2546.12 --> 2549.10]  So, if I can lead you into family prayer now.
[2550.48 --> 2551.86]  Dear God, thank you for this day.
[2553.58 --> 2558.40]  Thank you for this time we have together to be in fellowship with one another and to also worship you.
[2559.54 --> 2563.00]  As the leaves fall and the days get shorter and the days get cooler,
[2563.14 --> 2567.22]  we are reminded of your faithfulness and steadfastness through the changing season.
[2567.22 --> 2572.92]  It is a reminder that you are in control and we need to trust you for all things.
[2574.94 --> 2578.14]  We thank you, Lord, for all the many blessings you have given us.
[2578.24 --> 2582.52]  The gift of children, as we have seen here this morning, just a minute ago.
[2583.58 --> 2587.54]  The gifts of work, holidays, friends, community, and health.
[2587.54 --> 2593.18]  When we watch or hear the news, we can be thankful for living in this great country.
[2594.14 --> 2599.94]  When you hear about what's going on around the world in places like Ukraine and Russia, China, and other countries,
[2600.02 --> 2601.82]  we are thankful for this country, Canada.
[2603.82 --> 2608.30]  As recessions and slowing economy predictions are starting to become more common,
[2608.30 --> 2612.30]  we can be thankful that we can trust in you to help us wither the unpredictability.
[2613.92 --> 2617.62]  We are thankful, Lord, that Josh Chamberlain is our new young adult ministry leader.
[2618.44 --> 2622.62]  He's done great work here through you, Lord, in this ministry here at Emmanuel in the past,
[2622.68 --> 2626.64]  and we are excited to see what your plan is for him in the days, weeks, and months to come.
[2626.64 --> 2632.62]  We pray, Lord, for the handsome family this morning who shared with their community yesterday
[2632.62 --> 2635.22]  the life of their wonderful brother and son, Aaron.
[2636.32 --> 2640.88]  What a wonderful testament Aaron was to the joy and peace of following you
[2640.88 --> 2643.04]  and the witness he was to those around him.
[2644.80 --> 2647.10]  Lord, as none of us enjoy losing loved ones,
[2647.24 --> 2650.62]  funerals are often a great way to reflect on what's really important in life.
[2651.98 --> 2655.22]  At Aaron's funeral, it was clear that family, community,
[2655.22 --> 2658.08]  and a life of following you is what is most important.
[2659.30 --> 2663.76]  Chasing after material wealth or likes on social media or power at the end of the day
[2663.76 --> 2667.34]  are little importance when you lose a friend and a loved one.
[2668.64 --> 2671.86]  Lord, we ask that you would work in all of us through your Holy Spirit
[2671.86 --> 2674.24]  that we will continually work to follow you more
[2674.24 --> 2677.84]  and to live out your plan for us each and every day.
[2679.54 --> 2682.06]  We pray, Lord, for the Klosterhof family this morning
[2682.06 --> 2685.14]  as we heard that Stacey's mom had a stroke earlier this week.
[2686.10 --> 2687.98]  This will be difficult for the family, Lord,
[2688.02 --> 2690.28]  and we ask that you will give the family traveling mercies
[2690.28 --> 2692.20]  as they plan to see Stacey's mom
[2692.20 --> 2696.06]  and that they will feel your comforting presence through this difficult time.
[2697.46 --> 2701.64]  And Lord, with the recent news of Joan's dad, Jared, and Nikki's grandpa
[2701.64 --> 2703.18]  who passed away this week, Tony,
[2703.88 --> 2705.50]  pray that you be close to them too, Lord,
[2705.56 --> 2710.56]  as they work through and mourn the passing of a loved one.
[2710.56 --> 2715.62]  Lord, I ask that this week you prepare our hearts, Lord,
[2715.72 --> 2718.32]  for us celebrating Lord's Supper next Sunday.
[2719.02 --> 2720.80]  Please prepare our hearts and minds
[2720.80 --> 2723.98]  as we anticipate the sharing of the sacrament together as believers.
[2726.20 --> 2729.28]  Lord, as many of us has much to be thankful for in this life,
[2729.38 --> 2731.78]  all of us have things that are on our minds
[2731.78 --> 2735.48]  and add stress, anxiety, or keep us awake at night.
[2736.38 --> 2738.86]  It may be children that are making poor decisions,
[2739.08 --> 2740.90]  choices, and are struggling in life.
[2741.54 --> 2743.70]  It may be marriages that are on rocky ground.
[2744.66 --> 2747.60]  It may be a conflict at work or employment challenges.
[2747.60 --> 2749.58]  It may be loneliness.
[2750.88 --> 2752.60]  It may be mental health struggles.
[2753.68 --> 2756.08]  It may be difficult financial dynamics.
[2757.26 --> 2758.92]  It may be physical ailments.
[2759.96 --> 2762.42]  And it may just be the challenges of just getting older.
[2764.14 --> 2766.08]  Whatever it is, Lord, we bring them all to you.
[2766.30 --> 2768.66]  We can't make it through any of this without your support,
[2768.78 --> 2771.32]  and we need you to walk beside us through these trials.
[2772.34 --> 2775.98]  For those of us, Lord, who know a friend, a colleague, or neighbor
[2775.98 --> 2777.60]  that is going through a difficult time,
[2777.70 --> 2779.24]  please give us the words to say,
[2779.64 --> 2783.02]  to have that shoulder for someone to lean on or cry on
[2783.02 --> 2786.44]  or a hug to offer when it is needed.
[2787.90 --> 2789.48]  Lord, help us to live in community
[2789.48 --> 2793.08]  and help each other through challenging times.
[2794.78 --> 2798.22]  Lord, in Philippians 4, 6-7, your words from Paul say,
[2798.36 --> 2799.84]  Do not be anxious about anything,
[2800.18 --> 2802.94]  but in every situation, by prayer and petition,
[2802.94 --> 2806.22]  with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.
[2807.02 --> 2810.24]  And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding,
[2810.36 --> 2812.84]  will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
[2814.68 --> 2818.80]  May your spirit continue to do its work in us this coming week.
[2819.50 --> 2821.42]  Help us be a light for you in all we do,
[2821.60 --> 2824.08]  and help us to glorify you in all our works and deeds.
[2825.00 --> 2826.52]  We ask all this in Jesus' name.
[2826.86 --> 2827.08]  Amen.
[2832.94 --> 2833.38]  Amen.
[2848.26 --> 2850.28]  It's good to be back with you all this morning.
[2850.52 --> 2856.24]  It's been a difficult, fairly heavy last couple of weeks, hasn't it?
[2857.34 --> 2859.92]  Personally, I think all of you heard a couple weeks ago
[2859.92 --> 2862.54]  some youth leaders and I were in a fairly scary car accident
[2862.54 --> 2865.34]  on the way to a youth leader's retreat.
[2866.12 --> 2868.86]  We changed lanes to go around a vehicle that had overturned
[2868.86 --> 2871.18]  and hit some black ice and fishtailed for quite a while
[2871.18 --> 2874.20]  and then ended up upside down in a ditch on the side of the highway
[2874.20 --> 2876.82]  on the connector between Merritt and Kelowna.
[2877.68 --> 2878.38]  It got as good.
[2878.54 --> 2879.46]  We all walked away.
[2879.72 --> 2880.86]  Miraculously, to be honest,
[2880.96 --> 2882.92]  only a couple scratches and a little bit of stiffness.
[2884.02 --> 2885.96]  Then a week ago, last weekend,
[2885.96 --> 2888.58]  many women here attended a very good,
[2888.68 --> 2890.52]  but again, fairly intense weekend
[2890.52 --> 2893.04]  at the Women's Fellowship Conference,
[2893.20 --> 2894.68]  which was hosted by a number of women here.
[2895.62 --> 2897.56]  Main topic of that weekend was grief.
[2897.74 --> 2899.84]  And while every report I've heard
[2899.84 --> 2902.22]  was how good of a weekend that was,
[2903.54 --> 2904.96]  weekends like that and events like that
[2904.96 --> 2905.94]  can certainly be heavy.
[2906.68 --> 2907.96]  On top of those things,
[2908.64 --> 2911.78]  yesterday I know many of us attended Aaron Hansen's funeral,
[2911.94 --> 2913.54]  which Eric just alluded to
[2913.54 --> 2915.00]  and prayed for a second ago.
[2915.00 --> 2916.42]  It was a hard day
[2916.42 --> 2918.54]  as we mourned and celebrated someone
[2918.54 --> 2920.24]  who was taken at such a young age.
[2921.24 --> 2923.34]  Yet the testimony shared yesterday were unbelievable
[2923.34 --> 2927.10]  and Aaron's life truly reflected God's light in this world.
[2927.88 --> 2928.66]  But it was still hard.
[2930.14 --> 2931.26]  It also reminds me of the many
[2931.26 --> 2933.14]  who are still grieving and mourning the loss
[2933.14 --> 2934.68]  of other family members,
[2934.78 --> 2938.02]  some passing away recently within the last days or weeks
[2938.02 --> 2940.54]  and others passing away months ago,
[2940.70 --> 2941.50]  even years ago.
[2941.50 --> 2945.46]  Now, I just wanted to name that reality here today
[2945.46 --> 2947.84]  because I know many of us are sitting in that.
[2948.84 --> 2951.82]  I also want to acknowledge that when life is rocky,
[2952.24 --> 2953.90]  we all want from a church service
[2953.90 --> 2956.92]  some sort of nice and fluffy and light passage
[2956.92 --> 2959.74]  that might just bring us a little bit of respite
[2959.74 --> 2961.22]  from the difficulty of life.
[2961.56 --> 2962.72]  And while that might make sense,
[2963.08 --> 2965.04]  I also want to name something else right now.
[2965.04 --> 2969.08]  As we continue through the psalms and our feelings,
[2969.46 --> 2974.80]  today's psalm is not that light, fluffy, cheery Bible passage
[2974.80 --> 2976.78]  some of us might be yearning for.
[2976.86 --> 2978.58]  It's not jolly or merry.
[2978.68 --> 2980.30]  Christmas is not quite here yet.
[2982.68 --> 2983.84]  Now, sometimes we get the impression
[2983.84 --> 2986.28]  that only psalms that sort of push through
[2986.28 --> 2987.72]  the doom and gloom of this world
[2987.72 --> 2990.02]  and end on this note of praise to our God
[2990.02 --> 2991.04]  make it into the Bible.
[2991.04 --> 2993.96]  But Psalm 88, the psalm we're going to read today,
[2994.22 --> 2995.82]  flies in the face of that assumption.
[2997.02 --> 2999.38]  Psalm 88 is called the Dark Psalm.
[3000.24 --> 3001.52]  And it's called that for a reason.
[3001.84 --> 3003.98]  So let's read it today and we'll see why.
[3004.52 --> 3005.68]  So if you've got your Bibles in front of you,
[3005.74 --> 3006.64]  please open those up.
[3006.72 --> 3007.58]  Please turn on your phones,
[3007.68 --> 3008.74]  read it on your Bible app,
[3009.08 --> 3009.92]  whatever you have.
[3010.00 --> 3011.74]  Please keep that open throughout this message.
[3012.26 --> 3015.28]  And I hope that we will be able to find
[3015.28 --> 3017.80]  the hope seen in this Dark Psalm today.
[3017.80 --> 3020.56]  And for those of you that were hoping
[3020.56 --> 3021.72]  for that light passage,
[3021.86 --> 3026.06]  hoping for that cheery, happy Bible text today,
[3026.18 --> 3027.62]  please do stay with me.
[3027.82 --> 3029.32]  Because I do believe that the hope found
[3029.32 --> 3030.54]  at the end of Psalm 88
[3030.54 --> 3033.18]  is going to be worth it for you today.
[3034.26 --> 3034.86]  So Psalm 88,
[3035.54 --> 3037.12]  please listen to the language
[3037.12 --> 3038.94]  that the psalmist uses here.
[3040.68 --> 3042.84]  Lord, you are the God who saves me.
[3043.22 --> 3045.36]  Day and night I cry out to you.
[3045.36 --> 3048.06]  May my prayer come before you.
[3048.40 --> 3050.24]  Turn your ear to my cry.
[3051.12 --> 3053.00]  I am overwhelmed with troubles
[3053.00 --> 3054.94]  and my life draws near to death.
[3055.22 --> 3057.78]  I am counted among those who go down to the pit.
[3058.12 --> 3060.44]  I am like one without strength.
[3061.24 --> 3062.84]  I am set apart with the dead,
[3062.92 --> 3065.26]  like the slain who lie in the grave,
[3065.50 --> 3066.90]  whom you remember no more,
[3067.48 --> 3069.04]  who are cut off from your care.
[3070.46 --> 3072.88]  You have put me in the lowest pit,
[3072.88 --> 3074.82]  in the darkest depths.
[3075.66 --> 3077.94]  Your wrath lies heavily on me.
[3078.58 --> 3081.02]  You have overwhelmed me with all your waves.
[3081.12 --> 3083.48]  You have taken from me my closest friends
[3083.48 --> 3086.02]  and have made me repulsive to them.
[3087.02 --> 3089.16]  I am confined and cannot escape.
[3089.30 --> 3091.50]  My eyes are dim with grief.
[3091.50 --> 3094.98]  I call to you, Lord.
[3095.04 --> 3097.06]  Every day I spread out my hands to you.
[3097.10 --> 3098.82]  Do you show your wonders to the dead?
[3098.90 --> 3101.24]  Do their spirits rise up and praise you?
[3101.50 --> 3103.42]  Is your love declared in the grave,
[3103.52 --> 3105.44]  your faithfulness in destruction?
[3105.80 --> 3108.32]  Are your wonders known in the place of darkness?
[3109.00 --> 3111.74]  Or your righteous deeds in the land of oblivion?
[3114.24 --> 3116.22]  But I cry to you for help, Lord.
[3116.38 --> 3119.26]  In the morning, my prayer comes before you.
[3119.26 --> 3123.98]  Why, Lord, do you reject me and hide your face from me?
[3125.22 --> 3128.54]  From my youth I have suffered and been close to death.
[3129.16 --> 3131.96]  I have borne your terrors and am in despair.
[3132.44 --> 3134.76]  Your wrath has swept over me.
[3135.16 --> 3137.82]  Your terrors have destroyed me.
[3139.02 --> 3141.62]  All day long they surround me like a flood.
[3142.30 --> 3144.16]  They have completely engulfed me.
[3145.16 --> 3148.24]  You have taken from me friend and neighbor.
[3148.24 --> 3152.06]  Darkness is my closest friend.
[3154.38 --> 3155.64]  That is the word of the Lord.
[3157.86 --> 3160.18]  There's not a lot of hope in those words, though, is there?
[3161.60 --> 3163.48]  Listen to how the psalmist feels.
[3163.82 --> 3165.78]  Verse 3, his soul is full of troubles.
[3165.90 --> 3167.46]  His life draws near to death.
[3167.68 --> 3169.30]  In the ESV and other translations,
[3169.76 --> 3171.68]  he says he draws near to Sheol,
[3171.82 --> 3174.96]  which in the Jewish tradition was sort of the underworld of darkness
[3174.96 --> 3176.26]  that comes after death.
[3176.26 --> 3179.72]  Verses 4 to 6, he says he's been put in the pit,
[3180.60 --> 3182.24]  like one without strength,
[3183.24 --> 3185.24]  like those who lie in a grave.
[3185.40 --> 3186.80]  Verse 8, he feels shunned,
[3187.38 --> 3188.32]  taken from friends,
[3188.44 --> 3190.62]  made to be repulsive to them.
[3192.06 --> 3194.32]  Verse 14, his soul feels cast away.
[3194.44 --> 3197.94]  He feels rejected by the very God he is speaking to.
[3197.94 --> 3204.16]  Verses 15 to 17, he feels like he's been suffering the wrath of God since his youth.
[3204.90 --> 3206.34]  He is close to death.
[3207.14 --> 3208.72]  Terrors have destroyed him.
[3209.78 --> 3214.78]  He's been taken from his friends and his neighbors.
[3214.78 --> 3217.64]  He is alone.
[3220.24 --> 3225.56]  And verse 18 concludes with perhaps one of the most heartbreaking lines in all of Scripture.
[3226.70 --> 3233.12]  After countless expressions of how alone and hurt and troubled and broken he is,
[3234.42 --> 3237.74]  the psalmist doesn't end by turning to God in hope.
[3237.74 --> 3240.28]  But he ends with the line,
[3240.50 --> 3242.14]  darkness is my only friend.
[3244.00 --> 3246.36]  His friends, his community, they've all abandoned him.
[3247.20 --> 3247.96]  He blames God.
[3248.42 --> 3251.40]  What's worse is that in his suffering,
[3251.56 --> 3253.40]  God does not seem to be drawing close to him.
[3253.54 --> 3255.78]  In fact, God appears to be painfully absent.
[3257.32 --> 3258.32]  His closest companion,
[3260.32 --> 3261.96]  darkness is his only friend.
[3261.96 --> 3266.22]  Church, we have a word for this feeling.
[3268.00 --> 3268.48]  Despair.
[3270.52 --> 3272.30]  As the psalmist describes to us,
[3272.42 --> 3274.46]  despair pulls us into isolation.
[3274.62 --> 3277.72]  It makes us feel lonely or hollow inside.
[3278.90 --> 3281.38]  But what I pray we will hopefully see today
[3281.38 --> 3283.52]  is that when we are wallowing in despair,
[3284.08 --> 3285.98]  when life is so overwhelming,
[3286.66 --> 3289.40]  when we feel alone or we feel hopeless
[3289.40 --> 3292.14]  or when we feel that darkness is our only friend,
[3293.48 --> 3296.10]  only Jesus can enter into that hollowness
[3296.10 --> 3297.62]  and truly draw us near.
[3298.86 --> 3300.72]  When we are in the pit of despair,
[3301.58 --> 3305.34]  only Jesus can enter into our hearts
[3305.34 --> 3306.24]  and draw us close.
[3308.60 --> 3310.76]  So let's have fun
[3310.76 --> 3312.98]  and talk about despair for a second.
[3314.70 --> 3316.00]  In Allender and Longman's book,
[3316.08 --> 3316.94]  The Cry of the Soul,
[3317.02 --> 3318.76]  which we've been using as a bit of a companion
[3318.76 --> 3319.84]  along with the Psalms
[3319.84 --> 3321.38]  as a guide for this sermon series,
[3321.88 --> 3323.12]  they describe despair as this.
[3323.46 --> 3324.66]  The passive cousin,
[3324.88 --> 3327.60]  despair is the passive cousin of jealousy.
[3328.34 --> 3330.06]  Both are triggered by abandonment,
[3330.12 --> 3332.70]  which leads to a loss of hope and loneliness.
[3333.26 --> 3336.10]  But while jealousy fights against the loss,
[3337.26 --> 3338.70]  despair turns and runs.
[3339.70 --> 3341.28]  It's a refusal to struggle,
[3342.46 --> 3343.98]  deafening our hearts to the hope
[3343.98 --> 3345.14]  that we will be rescued,
[3345.84 --> 3346.26]  redeemed,
[3346.50 --> 3347.36]  and happy.
[3347.36 --> 3349.76]  Now further to that,
[3349.82 --> 3350.94]  they go on to describe
[3350.94 --> 3352.52]  a spectrum of feelings,
[3352.62 --> 3352.88]  sort of,
[3352.92 --> 3354.10]  that despair falls onto.
[3354.20 --> 3355.82]  And that spectrum looks like this.
[3356.18 --> 3357.02]  You've got regret,
[3357.78 --> 3358.14]  sadness,
[3358.64 --> 3359.02]  depression,
[3359.58 --> 3360.42]  and then despair.
[3361.48 --> 3362.78]  So when we regret something,
[3362.88 --> 3364.56]  we acknowledge that we've lost something.
[3364.64 --> 3364.98]  For example,
[3365.10 --> 3367.12]  I regret not taking piano lessons.
[3367.92 --> 3368.14]  Right?
[3368.24 --> 3368.90]  When I was a kid,
[3368.94 --> 3370.38]  I regret not taking piano lessons.
[3370.52 --> 3371.94]  I listened to Megan here this morning
[3371.94 --> 3372.54]  play piano,
[3372.58 --> 3373.42]  and it brings me joy.
[3373.64 --> 3374.70]  And I look back on my life,
[3374.70 --> 3374.96]  and I think,
[3375.04 --> 3375.28]  man,
[3375.44 --> 3376.98]  probably should have taken piano lessons.
[3377.06 --> 3377.80]  That would have been good.
[3378.46 --> 3379.64]  I'm not sad,
[3379.72 --> 3380.26]  necessarily.
[3380.98 --> 3382.60]  I get that life's gone on,
[3382.64 --> 3383.86]  and things filled up my life.
[3383.86 --> 3384.60]  Instead of that,
[3385.30 --> 3387.34]  but that's regret.
[3389.10 --> 3390.80]  Sadness is the next step down.
[3390.90 --> 3391.22]  Sadness,
[3391.28 --> 3393.10]  we feel when things happen in our life
[3393.10 --> 3393.92]  which are sad.
[3394.12 --> 3396.00]  We are sad if someone lies to us,
[3396.08 --> 3397.36]  sad if someone we are close to
[3397.36 --> 3398.42]  moves away from us.
[3398.58 --> 3400.90]  We're sad when we lose something important to us.
[3400.90 --> 3402.40]  It's good to be sad
[3402.40 --> 3403.70]  because when we feel it,
[3403.82 --> 3406.84]  we feel sadness in moments of life
[3406.84 --> 3407.56]  that are troublesome.
[3409.44 --> 3412.68]  Depression is the next step on the spectrum.
[3413.42 --> 3415.86]  Now, many people live with some form of depression.
[3416.82 --> 3418.32]  Depression itself is a spectrum.
[3420.00 --> 3422.92]  Now, I'm going to be oversimplifying
[3422.92 --> 3424.50]  a very complex emotion here,
[3424.58 --> 3425.90]  so please forgive me for that,
[3426.00 --> 3428.04]  but depression is feeling sad
[3428.04 --> 3429.68]  without a reason to feel sad.
[3429.68 --> 3432.96]  If this were a sermon series on depression
[3432.96 --> 3434.20]  or a sermon on depression,
[3434.26 --> 3435.40]  we would go into this a lot more,
[3435.52 --> 3438.12]  so please know I'm not being dismissive here,
[3438.44 --> 3440.50]  and I'm not minimizing this difficult emotion.
[3440.62 --> 3441.66]  Depression is very hard,
[3442.10 --> 3443.34]  and people can live in depression
[3443.34 --> 3444.58]  for a very long time,
[3444.84 --> 3446.50]  but again, oversimplifying,
[3446.64 --> 3448.54]  depression is this feeling of sadness
[3448.54 --> 3451.70]  in seasons when there's nothing to be sad about
[3451.70 --> 3453.24]  around you.
[3455.64 --> 3457.76]  And then one step down from that is despair.
[3457.76 --> 3460.66]  Despair is emptiness.
[3461.24 --> 3464.02]  It's brokenness, loneliness, hopelessness.
[3465.24 --> 3468.54]  People can and have learned to live with depression,
[3469.14 --> 3470.88]  not so much with despair.
[3471.84 --> 3472.78]  Despair is paralyzing.
[3472.92 --> 3475.74]  It lives in both the head and the heart,
[3476.42 --> 3478.26]  and it can drive us,
[3478.30 --> 3479.86]  and often does drive us,
[3479.90 --> 3481.40]  into intense isolation.
[3481.40 --> 3485.38]  Now, despair is often experienced
[3485.38 --> 3487.02]  because of the loss of relationship.
[3487.18 --> 3488.76]  In Psalm 88, which we just read,
[3488.82 --> 3490.48]  it was the abandonment of his friends,
[3490.76 --> 3491.94]  his family, and his community,
[3492.02 --> 3492.86]  and even his God
[3492.86 --> 3494.58]  that brought him despair,
[3494.72 --> 3496.60]  brought him into intense isolation
[3496.60 --> 3498.66]  where darkness was his only friend.
[3498.74 --> 3501.52]  Again, read verses 8 and 18 of this passage.
[3502.08 --> 3503.46]  But that's why it's so important
[3503.46 --> 3504.64]  to talk about this emotion,
[3504.64 --> 3506.30]  because church,
[3506.54 --> 3509.66]  we will likely all feel despair
[3509.66 --> 3511.10]  at some point in our lives.
[3512.60 --> 3514.16]  The loss of relationship
[3514.16 --> 3516.64]  is a real threat to every one of us.
[3517.32 --> 3518.82]  We all know people close to us
[3518.82 --> 3520.28]  who have lost loved ones recently.
[3520.70 --> 3522.54]  We attended Aaron's funeral yesterday,
[3522.86 --> 3524.62]  parents' and siblings' funerals
[3524.62 --> 3526.46]  within the last month or years.
[3526.60 --> 3528.62]  We've read about those in our congregation
[3528.62 --> 3531.48]  who are mourning the deaths of loved ones,
[3531.48 --> 3534.18]  but it goes beyond death.
[3536.26 --> 3539.20]  Divorce slices relationships in half.
[3540.70 --> 3541.94]  Stubbornness and pride
[3541.94 --> 3545.20]  splits families and friends for years,
[3545.46 --> 3546.30]  even generations.
[3547.68 --> 3550.04]  The cliche of sex, drugs, and alcohol
[3550.04 --> 3551.94]  have ripped people from their homes
[3551.94 --> 3553.14]  and plummeted others
[3553.14 --> 3555.02]  far away from people who love them.
[3557.62 --> 3558.90]  Despair finds its roots
[3558.90 --> 3560.32]  when we lose relationships
[3560.32 --> 3561.48]  with people we love,
[3561.52 --> 3563.14]  no matter how we lose them.
[3565.48 --> 3566.84]  And we have all,
[3567.40 --> 3568.18]  or more accurately,
[3568.32 --> 3569.60]  we will all experience
[3569.60 --> 3571.08]  this loss of relationship
[3571.08 --> 3573.04]  and the subsequent loss of hope
[3573.04 --> 3574.74]  that can come from that.
[3575.28 --> 3576.88]  Again, as Allender and Longman say,
[3577.16 --> 3578.02]  some people attempt
[3578.02 --> 3579.32]  to cover up their feelings
[3579.32 --> 3581.78]  by muttering pious platitudes,
[3581.94 --> 3583.56]  like, praise the Lord anyway,
[3583.80 --> 3585.70]  or by shooing away sadness
[3585.70 --> 3587.70]  through immersion
[3587.70 --> 3589.62]  of the hectic busyness of life.
[3590.32 --> 3592.04]  But every once in a while,
[3592.72 --> 3593.72]  life catches us
[3593.72 --> 3595.44]  and brings us face to face
[3595.44 --> 3596.12]  with the reality,
[3596.28 --> 3597.72]  and we feel what appears to be
[3597.72 --> 3599.74]  an inconsolable sadness.
[3601.98 --> 3603.06]  Despair is out there
[3603.06 --> 3604.76]  and it's lurking for us.
[3604.86 --> 3605.92]  The temptation of despair
[3605.92 --> 3607.80]  is to move towards loneliness.
[3608.04 --> 3608.76]  The psalmist says,
[3609.16 --> 3610.54]  he was set apart with the dead
[3610.54 --> 3612.02]  like the slain who lie in the grave.
[3612.24 --> 3613.98]  He was remembered no more,
[3614.14 --> 3615.52]  cut off from God's care.
[3615.74 --> 3616.54]  He was confined.
[3616.66 --> 3617.60]  He could not escape.
[3617.60 --> 3619.36]  He was taken from his friends,
[3619.68 --> 3620.74]  taken from his neighbors,
[3620.84 --> 3622.50]  and he submitted to darkness
[3622.50 --> 3624.08]  because that was his only friend.
[3626.84 --> 3628.08]  Despair looks at the world
[3628.08 --> 3628.42]  and says,
[3628.54 --> 3629.14]  I am alone.
[3630.32 --> 3631.54]  No one can help me.
[3631.64 --> 3632.92]  No one cares about me.
[3632.96 --> 3633.22]  It says,
[3633.42 --> 3634.40]  I have no hope.
[3635.00 --> 3636.46]  Things are not going to get better.
[3638.28 --> 3638.92]  And because of this,
[3638.96 --> 3640.06]  I must not allow myself
[3640.06 --> 3640.72]  to hope again
[3640.72 --> 3641.88]  because I will only
[3641.88 --> 3643.32]  be bitterly disappointed.
[3643.32 --> 3646.16]  loneliness becomes
[3646.16 --> 3647.00]  the breeding ground
[3647.00 --> 3647.64]  for despair.
[3650.08 --> 3651.58]  And when we feel despair,
[3652.36 --> 3654.08]  it is hard to feel
[3654.08 --> 3654.90]  anything else.
[3656.74 --> 3657.70]  And at its worst,
[3658.66 --> 3659.94]  even what we know
[3659.94 --> 3660.84]  to be true
[3660.84 --> 3663.36]  often isn't enough
[3663.36 --> 3664.06]  to mitigate
[3664.06 --> 3666.00]  this crippling feeling.
[3668.32 --> 3669.80]  But here's the shift
[3669.80 --> 3670.86]  that is so important.
[3670.86 --> 3674.26]  Even if what we know
[3674.26 --> 3675.22]  to be true
[3675.22 --> 3676.30]  isn't enough
[3676.30 --> 3676.82]  to mitigate
[3676.82 --> 3678.04]  the feeling of despair,
[3679.00 --> 3680.84]  faith in Jesus Christ
[3680.84 --> 3682.44]  allows him
[3682.44 --> 3683.40]  to enter
[3683.40 --> 3684.58]  into our despair
[3684.58 --> 3686.20]  and reveal his hope
[3686.20 --> 3686.64]  to us.
[3686.82 --> 3687.62]  It becomes not
[3687.62 --> 3688.30]  what we know
[3688.30 --> 3689.06]  to be true
[3689.06 --> 3690.12]  that will heal us,
[3690.26 --> 3692.12]  but he who is truth
[3692.12 --> 3694.42]  who comes to heal us.
[3694.82 --> 3695.76]  That's the difference.
[3695.88 --> 3696.72]  That's the shift here
[3696.72 --> 3697.66]  because Jesus
[3697.66 --> 3698.58]  is big enough.
[3698.58 --> 3700.20]  If Jesus is big enough
[3700.20 --> 3701.84]  to enter into our despair
[3701.84 --> 3702.72]  because of this truth,
[3703.74 --> 3706.40]  Jesus knows despair
[3706.40 --> 3707.44]  like no other.
[3709.12 --> 3709.42]  All right,
[3709.52 --> 3709.90]  here we go.
[3711.06 --> 3711.94]  John 11,
[3712.02 --> 3713.14]  verses 1 to 44.
[3713.38 --> 3714.56]  It's a story about Jesus
[3714.56 --> 3715.96]  and his friend Lazarus.
[3717.64 --> 3718.62]  Most Christians,
[3718.82 --> 3719.28]  and in fact,
[3719.42 --> 3720.32]  most non-Christians
[3720.32 --> 3721.16]  know this story.
[3721.38 --> 3722.32]  Lazarus gets sick
[3722.32 --> 3723.58]  and he eventually dies
[3723.58 --> 3724.36]  from this illness.
[3724.90 --> 3725.98]  As many people know,
[3725.98 --> 3727.22]  at the end of the story,
[3727.34 --> 3729.78]  Jesus then raises Lazarus
[3729.78 --> 3730.56]  from the dead.
[3730.64 --> 3731.86]  But what also takes place
[3731.86 --> 3732.58]  in this story
[3732.58 --> 3733.64]  is the answer
[3733.64 --> 3735.48]  to one of the most popular
[3735.48 --> 3736.80]  pub trivia night questions
[3736.80 --> 3737.36]  out there
[3737.36 --> 3738.78]  that is told in bars
[3738.78 --> 3739.66]  across the globe,
[3740.00 --> 3741.44]  what is the shortest verse
[3741.44 --> 3742.10]  in the Bible?
[3742.46 --> 3742.72]  Anyone?
[3744.52 --> 3745.42]  Jesus wept.
[3746.22 --> 3746.84]  John 11,
[3747.62 --> 3748.28]  verse 35.
[3749.22 --> 3750.20]  Now here's a question
[3750.20 --> 3750.80]  for you today.
[3750.80 --> 3754.50]  Why would Jesus weep
[3754.50 --> 3756.16]  when he knew
[3756.16 --> 3757.54]  that he had the power
[3757.54 --> 3758.48]  to resurrect people
[3758.48 --> 3759.08]  from the dead
[3759.08 --> 3760.56]  and was minutes away
[3760.56 --> 3761.34]  from doing that?
[3763.50 --> 3764.48]  Why didn't he just
[3764.48 --> 3765.76]  crack his knuckles,
[3766.00 --> 3766.86]  crick his neck,
[3767.00 --> 3767.64]  shake it off,
[3767.70 --> 3768.32]  look at the disciples
[3768.32 --> 3768.70]  and say,
[3768.76 --> 3769.00]  all right,
[3769.10 --> 3769.82]  buckle up everyone,
[3770.14 --> 3770.68]  watch this,
[3771.00 --> 3771.26]  boom.
[3771.26 --> 3771.34]  Boom.
[3775.94 --> 3777.18]  Why would sadness
[3777.18 --> 3777.98]  consume him
[3777.98 --> 3779.36]  so much in that moment
[3779.36 --> 3781.54]  that he would weep?
[3781.68 --> 3782.82]  Not just cry,
[3783.32 --> 3784.26]  but weep
[3784.26 --> 3786.38]  when he knew
[3786.38 --> 3788.12]  he was going to raise
[3788.12 --> 3789.20]  Lazarus from the dead.
[3791.04 --> 3792.32]  Because of one thing.
[3793.62 --> 3795.02]  Jesus knew that death
[3795.02 --> 3795.94]  was inevitable
[3795.94 --> 3797.42]  in this fallen world
[3797.42 --> 3798.00]  that we live in.
[3798.22 --> 3798.86]  He understood
[3798.86 --> 3800.64]  that though Lazarus
[3800.64 --> 3801.46]  would be raised
[3801.46 --> 3802.06]  from the dead
[3802.06 --> 3803.02]  in mere moments,
[3804.12 --> 3804.90]  Lazarus would also
[3804.90 --> 3805.50]  die again.
[3807.58 --> 3808.10]  Jesus wept
[3808.10 --> 3809.00]  because he understood
[3809.00 --> 3810.10]  that death was real,
[3810.18 --> 3811.22]  that death severs
[3811.22 --> 3812.10]  relationships,
[3812.28 --> 3813.44]  that death brings
[3813.44 --> 3814.26]  despair.
[3815.02 --> 3815.64]  Jesus understood
[3815.64 --> 3816.80]  that the emotions
[3816.80 --> 3817.78]  death bring to people
[3817.78 --> 3818.50]  and the magnitude
[3818.50 --> 3819.74]  of despair in this world.
[3820.98 --> 3821.58]  The fact is,
[3821.68 --> 3823.14]  Jesus lived this reality
[3823.14 --> 3824.40]  on the way to the cross too.
[3825.56 --> 3826.44]  Before his death,
[3826.80 --> 3828.44]  which was this horrific,
[3828.82 --> 3829.78]  horrific death
[3829.78 --> 3830.98]  involving physical
[3830.98 --> 3832.02]  and emotional torture,
[3832.64 --> 3833.68]  his best friends
[3833.68 --> 3834.90]  would sever their relationships
[3834.90 --> 3835.70]  from him as well.
[3836.58 --> 3837.50]  In Matthew 26,
[3837.50 --> 3838.16]  verse 38,
[3838.28 --> 3839.94]  Jesus is in despair.
[3840.16 --> 3840.98]  Listen to what he says
[3840.98 --> 3841.50]  to his disciples.
[3841.64 --> 3841.88]  He says,
[3842.22 --> 3844.10]  my soul is overwhelmed
[3844.10 --> 3844.90]  with sorrow
[3844.90 --> 3846.34]  to the point of death.
[3847.54 --> 3848.90]  That sounds like Psalm 88.
[3849.84 --> 3851.04]  My soul is overwhelmed
[3851.04 --> 3851.70]  with sorrow
[3851.70 --> 3852.62]  to the point of death.
[3852.78 --> 3853.58]  And then he asks them,
[3853.68 --> 3855.46]  please stay here
[3855.46 --> 3857.28]  and keep watch with me.
[3858.56 --> 3859.72]  He asks his friends
[3859.72 --> 3860.90]  to stay with him,
[3860.96 --> 3862.04]  be present with me,
[3862.68 --> 3864.04]  keep watch with me.
[3864.04 --> 3866.12]  But his friends
[3866.12 --> 3866.82]  couldn't do that.
[3868.12 --> 3870.04]  They kept falling asleep.
[3871.14 --> 3872.04]  In his despair,
[3872.48 --> 3873.10]  they struggled
[3873.10 --> 3873.98]  to be with him.
[3875.06 --> 3875.70]  Worse than that,
[3876.04 --> 3877.00]  Jesus gets arrested
[3877.00 --> 3877.92]  moments later
[3877.92 --> 3879.48]  and we read in Luke 22
[3879.48 --> 3881.18]  that his closest friends
[3881.18 --> 3883.86]  denied that they ever knew him.
[3884.62 --> 3886.02]  They denied any connections
[3886.02 --> 3887.08]  to Jesus at all.
[3887.90 --> 3888.82]  They just left him.
[3888.82 --> 3891.68]  Jesus was abandoned
[3891.68 --> 3893.14]  at the peak of his despair
[3893.14 --> 3894.38]  by those who loved him most.
[3895.82 --> 3896.50]  And church,
[3896.58 --> 3897.28]  not only was Jesus
[3897.28 --> 3898.48]  abandoned by his friends,
[3898.68 --> 3899.52]  but he was abandoned
[3899.52 --> 3901.00]  by God the Father as well.
[3901.18 --> 3901.84]  On the cross,
[3902.22 --> 3903.40]  after he had been beaten
[3903.40 --> 3904.52]  and mocked
[3904.52 --> 3905.94]  and he'd been abandoned
[3905.94 --> 3906.78]  by his friends
[3906.78 --> 3907.40]  and he's hanging
[3907.40 --> 3908.42]  on this piece of wood,
[3908.78 --> 3910.00]  nails in his hand,
[3910.56 --> 3911.90]  pushing up on the nail
[3911.90 --> 3912.52]  in his legs
[3912.52 --> 3913.32]  to keep his lungs
[3913.32 --> 3914.12]  from collapsing.
[3914.44 --> 3915.32]  And at the very end
[3915.32 --> 3915.86]  of his life,
[3916.06 --> 3917.08]  with whatever energy
[3917.08 --> 3918.00]  he has left,
[3918.00 --> 3919.02]  he musters up
[3919.02 --> 3919.70]  some strength,
[3920.10 --> 3920.80]  whatever strength
[3920.80 --> 3922.22]  is left in his mangled body
[3922.22 --> 3923.62]  and he cries out
[3923.62 --> 3924.88]  in a loud voice,
[3925.18 --> 3925.82]  My God!
[3925.98 --> 3926.66]  My God!
[3926.72 --> 3928.32]  Why have you forsaken me?
[3931.66 --> 3932.74]  My God!
[3932.92 --> 3933.62]  My God!
[3934.04 --> 3936.30]  Why have you abandoned me?
[3940.84 --> 3942.12]  The psalmist today
[3942.12 --> 3943.40]  felt like God
[3943.40 --> 3944.24]  had abandoned him
[3944.24 --> 3945.22]  in his despair.
[3945.70 --> 3946.80]  But on the cross,
[3946.80 --> 3949.82]  Jesus was abandoned
[3949.82 --> 3951.68]  in his despair.
[3951.86 --> 3954.64]  Jesus knew despair.
[3957.10 --> 3958.26]  And better yet,
[3958.78 --> 3960.62]  Jesus knows despair.
[3960.78 --> 3962.52]  He knows despair,
[3962.66 --> 3963.32]  present tense,
[3963.42 --> 3965.14]  because that horrific death
[3965.14 --> 3965.84]  on the cross
[3965.84 --> 3966.98]  was not the end for him.
[3967.38 --> 3968.74]  He knows despair
[3968.74 --> 3969.98]  because he still lives.
[3970.34 --> 3971.32]  He knows despair
[3971.32 --> 3972.54]  because three days later,
[3972.86 --> 3974.28]  Jesus rose from the dead,
[3974.28 --> 3975.94]  he atoned for our sins,
[3976.10 --> 3977.70]  he defeated sin and death
[3977.70 --> 3978.74]  once and for all,
[3978.76 --> 3979.80]  and now he sits in heaven
[3979.80 --> 3980.82]  and he is currently
[3980.82 --> 3982.60]  interceding for you
[3982.60 --> 3984.22]  whenever you cry out to him
[3984.22 --> 3985.40]  in your despair,
[3985.78 --> 3987.34]  entering into whatever it is
[3987.34 --> 3988.28]  you are going through
[3988.28 --> 3989.82]  when asked.
[3990.44 --> 3991.06]  See, Jesus,
[3991.22 --> 3992.46]  he went through this pit
[3992.46 --> 3992.94]  of despair
[3992.94 --> 3993.86]  and he fulfilled
[3993.86 --> 3995.24]  the redemption plan
[3995.24 --> 3996.44]  that he had known
[3996.44 --> 3998.12]  was necessary all along.
[3998.64 --> 3998.88]  Jesus,
[3999.12 --> 3999.92]  he didn't want to go
[3999.92 --> 4000.56]  through all of that.
[4000.56 --> 4001.52]  He didn't want
[4001.52 --> 4002.56]  to have to die
[4002.56 --> 4003.26]  in that way
[4003.26 --> 4004.00]  to go through
[4004.00 --> 4005.16]  that type of torture,
[4005.50 --> 4005.88]  to go through
[4005.88 --> 4007.10]  that type of despair.
[4007.42 --> 4008.66]  Matthew 26, 39
[4008.66 --> 4009.48]  tells us that.
[4009.74 --> 4010.36]  He asked God
[4010.36 --> 4011.64]  to take that cup from him,
[4011.84 --> 4012.48]  but he knew
[4012.48 --> 4013.28]  that he had to.
[4013.86 --> 4014.96]  He knew that he had
[4014.96 --> 4015.74]  to endure it
[4015.74 --> 4016.74]  because that kind
[4016.74 --> 4017.32]  of suffering
[4017.32 --> 4018.68]  he needed to go through
[4018.68 --> 4019.26]  in order
[4019.26 --> 4021.68]  for us to be saved.
[4022.60 --> 4024.24]  He had to go through that
[4024.24 --> 4027.80]  to save us.
[4028.46 --> 4029.52]  He didn't want to,
[4029.52 --> 4031.24]  but he willingly did it
[4031.24 --> 4032.26]  for you and for me.
[4033.10 --> 4035.14]  He went into the pits
[4035.14 --> 4036.00]  of despair
[4036.00 --> 4038.32]  so that he could enter
[4038.32 --> 4039.62]  our despair with us.
[4040.68 --> 4042.34]  See, Jesus knows despair
[4042.34 --> 4044.72]  because Jesus conquered despair.
[4045.50 --> 4047.22]  Jesus' cries of despair
[4047.22 --> 4047.92]  on the cross
[4047.92 --> 4049.54]  were a promise to us all
[4049.54 --> 4050.34]  which transformed
[4050.34 --> 4051.30]  all humanity
[4051.30 --> 4053.50]  and all human suffering
[4053.50 --> 4055.16]  for those who believe in him.
[4056.62 --> 4057.40]  His death
[4057.40 --> 4058.84]  was a down payment
[4058.84 --> 4059.54]  on hope.
[4061.36 --> 4062.26]  Jesus suffered
[4062.26 --> 4063.30]  and so will we,
[4063.88 --> 4064.84]  but he has been there
[4064.84 --> 4065.36]  before us
[4065.36 --> 4066.50]  and he waits for us
[4066.50 --> 4067.46]  at the end of our sorrow.
[4067.78 --> 4069.20]  He has been perfectly
[4069.20 --> 4071.18]  resurrected
[4071.18 --> 4073.02]  through his suffering
[4073.02 --> 4076.20]  and so will we.
[4078.20 --> 4079.14]  With Jesus,
[4079.28 --> 4080.32]  all hopelessness
[4080.32 --> 4081.02]  is lost.
[4082.42 --> 4083.20]  With Jesus,
[4083.30 --> 4083.86]  all hope
[4083.86 --> 4084.68]  is found.
[4086.42 --> 4087.02]  Despair then,
[4087.12 --> 4087.88]  as hard
[4087.88 --> 4089.04]  and as isolating
[4089.04 --> 4089.90]  and as tragic
[4089.90 --> 4090.72]  as it is,
[4092.18 --> 4093.20]  despair can lead us
[4093.20 --> 4093.72]  to Jesus.
[4093.94 --> 4094.80]  Despair can break
[4094.80 --> 4096.08]  the heart open enough
[4096.08 --> 4097.18]  to let the hope
[4097.18 --> 4097.70]  of Jesus
[4097.70 --> 4098.66]  in.
[4098.66 --> 4101.22]  When things are going
[4101.22 --> 4102.02]  well in our lives,
[4102.10 --> 4103.10]  we often put our hope
[4103.10 --> 4104.02]  in earthly things,
[4104.14 --> 4104.26]  right?
[4104.96 --> 4105.88]  Especially people,
[4106.04 --> 4106.36]  actually.
[4106.56 --> 4107.66]  My marriage is good
[4107.66 --> 4108.72]  or he or she
[4108.72 --> 4109.64]  provides me the love
[4109.64 --> 4110.04]  I need.
[4110.30 --> 4111.40]  My friends are good.
[4111.48 --> 4112.42]  They bring me fun
[4112.42 --> 4113.98]  and joy in my life.
[4114.04 --> 4114.92]  My family is good.
[4114.96 --> 4115.56]  They care for me.
[4115.62 --> 4116.12]  They make sure
[4116.12 --> 4117.20]  that I am looked after.
[4117.26 --> 4118.40]  Even my boss is good
[4118.40 --> 4119.42]  because he provides me
[4119.42 --> 4120.32]  or she provides me
[4120.32 --> 4121.74]  the financial security
[4121.74 --> 4122.88]  that I do.
[4123.00 --> 4123.56]  And sometimes
[4123.56 --> 4124.44]  when things aren't good,
[4124.50 --> 4126.06]  we desire earthly hope
[4126.06 --> 4127.56]  in the form of relationships.
[4127.56 --> 4128.52]  Maybe sometimes
[4128.52 --> 4129.66]  we long for that spouse.
[4129.76 --> 4129.98]  We think,
[4130.06 --> 4130.90]  oh, if I just had a spouse,
[4131.02 --> 4131.54]  things would be better.
[4131.72 --> 4132.80]  Or if I just had a kid,
[4133.10 --> 4133.70]  things would be better.
[4133.76 --> 4134.72]  If I just had a friend,
[4135.16 --> 4135.80]  things would be better.
[4135.88 --> 4137.40]  If I just had a better community,
[4137.72 --> 4138.48]  I would be better.
[4138.82 --> 4139.98]  But the problem is
[4139.98 --> 4141.22]  those relationships,
[4141.42 --> 4142.14]  whether we have them
[4142.14 --> 4142.90]  or we seek them,
[4142.96 --> 4143.62]  they break down.
[4145.38 --> 4146.28]  And when they do,
[4146.42 --> 4148.50]  our earthly hope dissipates.
[4150.62 --> 4151.66]  And that's when despair
[4151.66 --> 4152.76]  is lurking around the corner.
[4154.10 --> 4155.08]  But hope in Jesus,
[4155.42 --> 4157.22]  hope in Jesus' gospel truth,
[4157.22 --> 4158.40]  hope in the understanding
[4158.40 --> 4159.52]  that our Savior knows
[4159.52 --> 4160.32]  what it means
[4160.32 --> 4161.64]  to live in despair.
[4162.02 --> 4163.70]  Hope in Jesus
[4163.70 --> 4165.66]  goes past earthly hope.
[4166.74 --> 4167.84]  And it points us
[4167.84 --> 4168.82]  to an eternal hope.
[4170.56 --> 4171.90]  Again, Allender and Longman,
[4171.94 --> 4172.48]  they say this.
[4172.84 --> 4173.16]  They say,
[4173.36 --> 4174.46]  ungodly despair
[4174.46 --> 4176.62]  is a flight from desire.
[4177.42 --> 4178.40]  It is a refusal
[4178.40 --> 4179.66]  to embrace loss
[4179.66 --> 4180.42]  as a deepening
[4180.42 --> 4181.32]  of the hollowness
[4181.32 --> 4182.42]  that makes more room
[4182.42 --> 4182.90]  for God.
[4182.90 --> 4185.26]  Godly despair,
[4185.36 --> 4185.56]  though,
[4185.84 --> 4187.10]  cries out for perspective.
[4188.54 --> 4189.50]  But it allows
[4189.50 --> 4191.54]  the hollowness of loss
[4191.54 --> 4192.22]  to move the heart
[4192.22 --> 4193.04]  to seek God.
[4195.36 --> 4196.14]  Godly despair
[4196.14 --> 4196.88]  seeks God
[4196.88 --> 4197.88]  in the midst of turmoil.
[4199.40 --> 4200.06]  Questioning God
[4200.06 --> 4200.92]  in the midst of despair
[4200.92 --> 4202.04]  actually honors Him.
[4203.00 --> 4203.84]  It turns our hearts
[4203.84 --> 4205.36]  away from ungodly despair
[4205.36 --> 4206.84]  and towards
[4206.84 --> 4208.04]  a passionate desire
[4208.04 --> 4209.62]  to comprehend God
[4209.62 --> 4210.66]  and His actions
[4210.66 --> 4211.28]  in our lives.
[4211.28 --> 4212.42]  That's the beauty
[4212.42 --> 4213.40]  of Psalm 88.
[4213.64 --> 4215.34]  As dark as it is,
[4215.46 --> 4218.34]  as hard as it is to read,
[4218.42 --> 4219.24]  despite everything
[4219.24 --> 4220.44]  that the psalmist is feeling,
[4221.60 --> 4222.82]  he's crying out to God.
[4224.10 --> 4225.28]  Even feeling as though
[4225.28 --> 4226.08]  God has left him,
[4226.14 --> 4227.38]  he starts the psalm with,
[4227.54 --> 4227.74]  Lord,
[4227.88 --> 4228.66]  You are the God
[4228.66 --> 4229.42]  who saves me.
[4230.44 --> 4231.26]  Even if that is
[4231.26 --> 4232.14]  simply an address,
[4233.60 --> 4234.84]  he is still addressing God.
[4237.54 --> 4238.76]  When we turn to God
[4238.76 --> 4239.18]  in despair,
[4239.18 --> 4240.04]  when we cry
[4240.04 --> 4241.24]  to the only being
[4241.24 --> 4242.32]  who can fill
[4242.32 --> 4243.06]  the hollowness
[4243.06 --> 4244.06]  left in our hearts,
[4245.06 --> 4247.70]  when we do that,
[4247.74 --> 4248.72]  we see this theme
[4248.72 --> 4250.30]  of hope
[4250.30 --> 4251.62]  enter our lives.
[4251.86 --> 4252.52]  We actually see
[4252.52 --> 4253.36]  this theme
[4253.36 --> 4254.02]  throughout Scripture
[4254.02 --> 4254.92]  time and time again.
[4255.18 --> 4256.24]  You see it elsewhere
[4256.24 --> 4256.78]  in the psalm,
[4256.86 --> 4257.48]  Psalm 77,
[4257.72 --> 4258.74]  I cried out to God
[4258.74 --> 4259.14]  for help.
[4259.38 --> 4260.44]  I cried out to the God
[4260.44 --> 4260.86]  to hear me.
[4260.92 --> 4261.64]  When I was in distress,
[4261.76 --> 4262.60]  I sought the Lord.
[4262.84 --> 4263.18]  At night,
[4263.18 --> 4264.00]  I stretched out
[4264.00 --> 4265.10]  on tiring hands.
[4265.80 --> 4266.20]  Psalm 30,
[4266.32 --> 4266.70]  David says,
[4266.78 --> 4267.42]  To you, Lord,
[4267.42 --> 4268.14]  I called out.
[4268.52 --> 4269.10]  To the Lord,
[4269.18 --> 4270.00]  I cried for mercy.
[4270.14 --> 4270.78]  Hear, Lord,
[4270.84 --> 4272.00]  and be merciful to me.
[4272.10 --> 4272.40]  Lord,
[4272.64 --> 4273.50]  be my help.
[4274.22 --> 4274.70]  You see it
[4274.70 --> 4275.34]  with the prophets,
[4276.34 --> 4277.12]  the entire book
[4277.12 --> 4277.72]  of Jeremiah.
[4278.64 --> 4278.98]  You see it
[4278.98 --> 4279.92]  with the prophet Ezekiel.
[4280.00 --> 4280.36]  You see it
[4280.36 --> 4281.38]  with the prophet Hosea.
[4282.26 --> 4282.68]  And of course,
[4282.72 --> 4283.24]  we see it
[4283.24 --> 4284.54]  in Jesus,
[4284.66 --> 4285.12]  as mentioned,
[4285.20 --> 4285.82]  in his life
[4285.82 --> 4286.80]  and his death
[4286.80 --> 4287.78]  and his resurrection.
[4289.16 --> 4289.70]  When we turn
[4289.70 --> 4290.56]  to God in despair,
[4290.68 --> 4291.36]  he is there.
[4292.06 --> 4292.66]  Our Savior
[4292.66 --> 4293.38]  is there.
[4294.16 --> 4294.28]  Now,
[4294.28 --> 4294.70]  maybe we need
[4294.70 --> 4295.26]  to pray like
[4295.26 --> 4295.94]  the psalmist
[4295.94 --> 4296.62]  in Psalm 88.
[4296.72 --> 4297.24]  Maybe we just need
[4297.24 --> 4298.04]  to cry out
[4298.04 --> 4299.22]  and demand
[4299.22 --> 4300.08]  God's attention.
[4301.48 --> 4302.82]  But Jesus is there.
[4303.86 --> 4304.52]  And he fills
[4304.52 --> 4305.26]  that place
[4305.26 --> 4305.98]  with his presence.
[4307.74 --> 4308.82]  There are so many
[4308.82 --> 4309.92]  stories in our world
[4309.92 --> 4310.46]  of this truth.
[4310.60 --> 4312.00]  We see broken people
[4312.00 --> 4313.40]  in the pit of despair
[4313.40 --> 4314.22]  turning to Jesus
[4314.22 --> 4315.06]  at the last resort.
[4315.34 --> 4316.06]  And what happens?
[4317.08 --> 4317.66]  They meet him.
[4318.86 --> 4319.92]  They meet him.
[4321.68 --> 4322.46]  If you've spent
[4322.46 --> 4323.08]  any time
[4323.08 --> 4323.88]  at Gateway of Hope
[4323.88 --> 4324.40]  down the road
[4324.40 --> 4325.56]  or Union Gospel Mission
[4325.56 --> 4326.14]  in Vancouver
[4326.14 --> 4327.52]  or Night Shift
[4327.52 --> 4328.12]  in Surrey,
[4329.16 --> 4330.26]  you hear stories
[4330.26 --> 4330.64]  like that
[4330.64 --> 4331.62]  over and over again.
[4332.56 --> 4333.36]  I just had the pleasure
[4333.36 --> 4334.26]  of chatting with Uriel
[4334.26 --> 4335.30]  and Jody Gonzalez
[4335.30 --> 4336.02]  down in Mexico.
[4336.64 --> 4338.06]  Uriel runs a rehab,
[4338.22 --> 4339.02]  a transition house,
[4339.10 --> 4339.22]  sorry,
[4339.32 --> 4340.72]  for rehabilitating men.
[4341.10 --> 4342.12]  And he's got story
[4342.12 --> 4342.92]  after story
[4342.92 --> 4343.66]  after story
[4343.66 --> 4345.54]  of these broken men
[4345.54 --> 4346.72]  in the pits of despair
[4346.72 --> 4348.24]  asking Jesus
[4348.24 --> 4348.90]  to enter in.
[4349.00 --> 4349.72]  And he does.
[4349.72 --> 4350.72]  He does.
[4353.88 --> 4354.80]  Jesus enters in
[4354.80 --> 4355.28]  and people are
[4355.28 --> 4356.08]  turning to him.
[4359.08 --> 4359.84]  The testimony
[4359.84 --> 4360.88]  from the Hanson family
[4360.88 --> 4362.16]  yesterday afternoon
[4362.16 --> 4362.90]  at Aaron's funeral
[4362.90 --> 4363.96]  speaks to this truth too.
[4364.88 --> 4365.54]  If you were there
[4365.54 --> 4366.28]  or you followed them
[4366.28 --> 4366.66]  online,
[4366.72 --> 4367.44]  you saw the posts
[4367.44 --> 4367.92]  from them,
[4368.70 --> 4369.46]  you see the hope
[4369.46 --> 4370.26]  they have in Jesus.
[4370.84 --> 4371.58]  Even in the midst
[4371.58 --> 4372.28]  of this despair
[4372.28 --> 4373.10]  that they're going through.
[4373.74 --> 4374.68]  You see the testimony
[4374.68 --> 4375.82]  of Aaron's life.
[4376.92 --> 4377.92]  You heard the gospel
[4377.92 --> 4379.12]  preached over and over
[4379.12 --> 4380.44]  and over and over again
[4380.44 --> 4380.96]  yesterday
[4380.96 --> 4382.28]  after his death.
[4382.40 --> 4382.70]  Jesus
[4382.70 --> 4385.06]  was with them
[4385.06 --> 4387.08]  and the people there
[4387.08 --> 4387.70]  at that funeral
[4387.70 --> 4388.70]  were turning to him.
[4390.24 --> 4390.82]  It doesn't mean
[4390.82 --> 4391.86]  it's easy.
[4392.78 --> 4393.18]  The Hansons
[4393.18 --> 4394.26]  are still heartbroken.
[4396.02 --> 4396.46]  But Jesus
[4396.46 --> 4397.50]  is filling them up
[4397.50 --> 4398.60]  because it is Jesus
[4398.60 --> 4399.60]  who enters in
[4399.60 --> 4400.74]  to that despair.
[4403.72 --> 4404.64]  I'm going to conclude
[4404.64 --> 4405.02]  right here
[4405.02 --> 4405.62]  with just a couple
[4405.62 --> 4406.52]  of final thoughts.
[4406.82 --> 4407.34]  Just a couple
[4407.34 --> 4408.26]  of maybe take-homes
[4408.26 --> 4408.74]  today.
[4409.90 --> 4410.36]  We're going to start
[4410.36 --> 4410.92]  with this one.
[4412.62 --> 4413.40]  Some of you,
[4413.86 --> 4415.10]  perhaps even many of you
[4415.10 --> 4415.92]  listening today,
[4416.04 --> 4417.24]  you might not find
[4417.24 --> 4418.36]  yourself in this place
[4418.36 --> 4418.80]  right now,
[4418.86 --> 4420.06]  in this place of despair.
[4420.64 --> 4421.64]  You might not be there.
[4422.80 --> 4423.30]  And that's good.
[4425.14 --> 4426.16]  But I would almost
[4426.16 --> 4426.68]  guarantee
[4426.68 --> 4428.12]  that everyone
[4428.12 --> 4429.02]  is an arm's length
[4429.02 --> 4429.90]  away from someone
[4429.90 --> 4430.38]  who is.
[4431.98 --> 4433.24]  So how do we then
[4433.24 --> 4433.90]  help those
[4433.90 --> 4435.80]  who are feeling
[4435.80 --> 4437.54]  despair right now?
[4437.54 --> 4439.40]  And the answer
[4439.40 --> 4440.32]  is to be like Jesus.
[4440.44 --> 4441.40]  The answer is to be
[4441.40 --> 4442.86]  present with them.
[4442.96 --> 4443.84]  Know that you are
[4443.84 --> 4444.48]  not Jesus.
[4444.68 --> 4445.86]  You cannot cure them
[4445.86 --> 4446.90]  of their despair.
[4447.00 --> 4447.62]  You're not called to.
[4447.66 --> 4448.46]  You're not called
[4448.46 --> 4449.84]  to cure that feeling.
[4450.38 --> 4451.28]  But we do need
[4451.28 --> 4451.92]  to be as hands
[4451.92 --> 4452.66]  and feet there.
[4453.22 --> 4454.38]  So enter into
[4454.38 --> 4455.10]  that despair
[4455.10 --> 4455.60]  with them.
[4456.36 --> 4457.50]  That's what Jesus does.
[4457.56 --> 4457.92]  That's what we're
[4457.92 --> 4458.48]  called to do.
[4458.72 --> 4459.42]  Be present.
[4459.90 --> 4460.84]  Enter into the way
[4460.84 --> 4461.50]  that they feel.
[4461.92 --> 4462.66]  Weep with them.
[4463.84 --> 4464.70]  Sit with them.
[4464.86 --> 4465.72]  Be with them.
[4466.12 --> 4467.00]  Speak the truth
[4467.00 --> 4467.80]  with them.
[4468.66 --> 4469.34]  Be Jesus
[4469.34 --> 4470.78]  for them.
[4472.94 --> 4473.36]  Sometimes
[4473.36 --> 4474.42]  well-meaning Christians
[4474.42 --> 4475.28]  will say to those
[4475.28 --> 4475.62]  struggling,
[4476.10 --> 4477.00]  the classic platitude,
[4477.14 --> 4477.80]  God won't give you
[4477.80 --> 4478.80]  more than you can handle.
[4479.22 --> 4480.04]  But that's bunk.
[4480.36 --> 4481.78]  That is not
[4481.78 --> 4482.76]  how that passage
[4482.76 --> 4484.10]  in 1 Corinthians 10-13
[4484.10 --> 4484.44]  goes.
[4484.74 --> 4485.58]  Read that again with me.
[4485.62 --> 4486.22]  Maybe it's on the screen.
[4486.28 --> 4487.08]  I don't know if I put it up there.
[4487.32 --> 4487.96]  But it says this,
[4488.22 --> 4489.40]  And God is faithful.
[4489.58 --> 4490.36]  He will not let you
[4490.36 --> 4490.90]  be tempted
[4490.90 --> 4492.08]  beyond what you can hear,
[4492.70 --> 4493.62]  beyond what you can bear.
[4493.62 --> 4495.82]  But when you are tempted,
[4495.94 --> 4496.94]  He will provide a way out
[4496.94 --> 4497.64]  so that you can endure it.
[4497.66 --> 4498.78]  That's the text people quote
[4498.78 --> 4499.22]  when they say,
[4499.28 --> 4499.96]  God won't give you more
[4499.96 --> 4500.86]  than you can handle.
[4501.02 --> 4502.34]  That's a text about temptation.
[4503.02 --> 4504.40]  That's not a text about trials.
[4506.92 --> 4508.14]  There are and there will be
[4508.14 --> 4509.76]  many, many times
[4509.76 --> 4511.00]  and many, many trials
[4511.00 --> 4512.46]  that happen in our lives
[4512.46 --> 4513.82]  that we can't handle.
[4515.92 --> 4516.74]  But there's nothing
[4516.74 --> 4517.56]  that Jesus can't.
[4517.56 --> 4520.10]  So plenty will happen
[4520.10 --> 4521.36]  to people that they can't handle.
[4521.42 --> 4521.96]  And our calling
[4521.96 --> 4523.14]  is not to attempt
[4523.14 --> 4524.10]  to cure them
[4524.10 --> 4525.00]  with platitudes,
[4525.46 --> 4526.96]  but to enter into that despair
[4526.96 --> 4527.76]  as Jesus does.
[4529.10 --> 4530.84]  If the temptation of despair
[4530.84 --> 4532.08]  is to move people
[4532.08 --> 4533.16]  towards isolation,
[4533.50 --> 4534.28]  to move people
[4534.28 --> 4535.10]  towards loneliness,
[4535.92 --> 4537.38]  we need to be present
[4537.38 --> 4537.76]  with them
[4537.76 --> 4539.28]  so that they don't feel alone,
[4539.64 --> 4540.56]  so that they know
[4540.56 --> 4541.46]  they are not alone.
[4541.46 --> 4546.34]  Finally,
[4546.72 --> 4547.84]  for any of you
[4547.84 --> 4548.48]  who feels as though
[4548.48 --> 4549.10]  you might be living
[4549.10 --> 4550.16]  in despair right now,
[4550.42 --> 4551.34]  I want to encourage you
[4551.34 --> 4552.00]  with three things.
[4552.90 --> 4553.92]  The first is this.
[4555.14 --> 4556.00]  Please, please
[4556.00 --> 4557.00]  reach out to someone.
[4557.60 --> 4558.44]  Find someone
[4558.44 --> 4559.42]  you can talk to.
[4559.70 --> 4560.30]  Maybe it's me,
[4560.40 --> 4561.32]  maybe it's Pastor Chris,
[4561.40 --> 4562.22]  maybe it's your elder,
[4562.62 --> 4563.44]  maybe it's a mentor
[4563.44 --> 4564.50]  or a different leader,
[4564.62 --> 4565.46]  maybe it's a friend
[4565.46 --> 4566.74]  that you know really well,
[4566.82 --> 4567.52]  maybe it's a friend
[4567.52 --> 4568.60]  that you haven't been
[4568.60 --> 4569.60]  very vulnerable with
[4569.60 --> 4570.20]  for a while.
[4570.82 --> 4571.38]  Or maybe,
[4571.46 --> 4572.20]  it's actually someone
[4572.20 --> 4572.90]  that you've observed
[4572.90 --> 4573.58]  from afar.
[4575.02 --> 4575.84]  But you know
[4575.84 --> 4576.50]  that they could help
[4576.50 --> 4577.46]  enter into this season
[4577.46 --> 4577.90]  with you.
[4578.80 --> 4579.60]  Whoever that is,
[4579.70 --> 4580.54]  please don't delay.
[4581.18 --> 4582.50]  Don't hide in isolation.
[4582.72 --> 4584.28]  Don't run to the darkness.
[4586.14 --> 4586.94]  Find someone
[4586.94 --> 4587.90]  and speak to them
[4587.90 --> 4588.72]  about what you're feeling.
[4588.88 --> 4590.16]  Ask them to be present
[4590.16 --> 4590.74]  with you.
[4590.84 --> 4591.44]  Talk to them.
[4592.00 --> 4592.62]  Sit with them.
[4593.60 --> 4594.00]  And again,
[4594.08 --> 4594.82]  to that point, church,
[4594.86 --> 4595.52]  if someone comes
[4595.52 --> 4596.08]  and talks to you
[4596.08 --> 4596.80]  about how they're feeling
[4596.80 --> 4597.24]  this week,
[4597.28 --> 4598.36]  or any week for that matter,
[4599.20 --> 4600.16]  please enter into that
[4600.16 --> 4600.52]  with them.
[4601.46 --> 4602.66]  Be vulnerable and present.
[4602.80 --> 4603.52]  Pray with them.
[4604.96 --> 4605.56]  Which that segues
[4605.56 --> 4606.44]  to our second point.
[4607.74 --> 4608.10]  Second,
[4608.18 --> 4609.46]  if you're feeling despair today,
[4609.96 --> 4611.56]  please receive prayer.
[4612.48 --> 4613.18]  There's many ways
[4613.18 --> 4613.68]  you can do that,
[4613.74 --> 4614.32]  but today there's
[4614.32 --> 4615.08]  a specific way.
[4615.12 --> 4615.60]  There's going to actually
[4615.60 --> 4616.62]  be elders available
[4616.62 --> 4617.80]  pretty quick
[4617.80 --> 4619.32]  after the service.
[4619.42 --> 4620.36]  And if you feel so led,
[4620.40 --> 4621.88]  if Jesus has stirred
[4621.88 --> 4622.96]  in your heart this morning,
[4623.02 --> 4624.52]  I want to encourage you today
[4624.52 --> 4625.96]  to go up to one of our elders
[4625.96 --> 4626.56]  for prayer.
[4626.56 --> 4628.46]  So they're actually,
[4628.54 --> 4628.90]  they're going to make
[4628.90 --> 4629.56]  their way to those spots
[4629.56 --> 4629.88]  right now.
[4629.94 --> 4630.32]  So there's going to be
[4630.32 --> 4631.50]  an elder in this corner here,
[4631.52 --> 4631.98]  and there's going to be
[4631.98 --> 4632.60]  an elder over there
[4632.60 --> 4633.18]  in the back corner.
[4633.24 --> 4633.50]  There's going to be
[4633.50 --> 4634.06]  another elder
[4634.06 --> 4635.52]  in the multi-purpose room,
[4635.58 --> 4636.34]  kind of in the back
[4636.34 --> 4637.54]  to the right there
[4637.54 --> 4638.00]  in the hallway.
[4638.56 --> 4639.66]  And I encourage you,
[4639.76 --> 4640.20]  please,
[4641.20 --> 4643.22]  please seek them out.
[4643.56 --> 4644.24]  Allow them to pray
[4644.24 --> 4644.84]  for you today.
[4645.58 --> 4646.64]  They're available right now,
[4646.72 --> 4648.02]  during the last couple songs
[4648.02 --> 4648.50]  we're going to sing
[4648.50 --> 4648.88]  in a moment,
[4649.02 --> 4650.04]  and then after the service
[4650.04 --> 4650.46]  as well.
[4650.46 --> 4653.12]  I know that some of us
[4653.12 --> 4654.18]  are feeling in despair
[4654.18 --> 4654.70]  right now.
[4654.92 --> 4656.12]  Allow the body of Christ
[4656.12 --> 4656.72]  to lift you up.
[4656.76 --> 4657.22]  And finally,
[4657.32 --> 4657.86]  and really quickly,
[4658.48 --> 4659.78]  in the midst of everything
[4659.78 --> 4660.82]  you might be going through
[4660.82 --> 4661.34]  right now,
[4661.98 --> 4662.78]  please seek out
[4662.78 --> 4663.60]  your eternal hope.
[4664.00 --> 4665.22]  Find that hope in Jesus
[4665.22 --> 4666.74]  who knows what despair
[4666.74 --> 4667.38]  looks like.
[4668.40 --> 4669.16]  Through our sadness
[4669.16 --> 4669.68]  and despair,
[4669.80 --> 4670.54]  we learn something
[4670.54 --> 4671.36]  about the heart
[4671.36 --> 4672.26]  of our Lord,
[4672.36 --> 4673.50]  and when we connect
[4673.50 --> 4674.64]  our despair to Christ,
[4674.72 --> 4675.34]  when we seek
[4675.34 --> 4676.78]  and cry out to God,
[4677.90 --> 4678.88]  we can trust
[4678.88 --> 4679.38]  He will enter
[4679.38 --> 4680.14]  into our despair.
[4680.46 --> 4681.28]  He helps us out
[4681.28 --> 4681.80]  of the pit.
[4683.48 --> 4684.26]  And so in this way,
[4685.08 --> 4686.26]  let despair catapult us,
[4686.32 --> 4687.78]  not into the dark abyss,
[4688.44 --> 4689.84]  but into the bright presence
[4689.84 --> 4691.54]  of God.
[4691.98 --> 4692.24]  Amen?
[4693.24 --> 4693.90]  Let me pray.
[4694.26 --> 4694.84]  Father God,
[4696.12 --> 4697.10]  in a world
[4697.10 --> 4698.36]  where so much happens,
[4699.76 --> 4700.92]  in a world where,
[4701.12 --> 4701.20]  sure,
[4701.30 --> 4702.28]  we experience good,
[4702.68 --> 4703.44]  but we also
[4703.44 --> 4704.84]  experience hardship,
[4705.98 --> 4706.24]  Lord,
[4706.32 --> 4706.86]  when the loss
[4706.86 --> 4707.54]  of relationship
[4707.54 --> 4707.86]  or,
[4709.10 --> 4709.90]  when the loss
[4709.90 --> 4710.46]  of relationship
[4710.46 --> 4710.98]  brings us
[4710.98 --> 4711.54]  into the pits
[4711.54 --> 4712.00]  of despair,
[4712.12 --> 4712.38]  God,
[4713.02 --> 4713.76]  may we not
[4713.76 --> 4715.46]  turn to loneliness.
[4715.96 --> 4716.88]  May we not run
[4716.88 --> 4717.90]  to isolation
[4717.90 --> 4719.08]  or seek out darkness
[4719.08 --> 4719.74]  as our friend.
[4720.96 --> 4721.16]  God,
[4721.20 --> 4721.96]  may we cry out
[4721.96 --> 4722.36]  to you.
[4723.50 --> 4723.74]  Jesus,
[4723.86 --> 4724.50]  may you enter
[4724.50 --> 4725.44]  into the hearts
[4725.44 --> 4726.52]  of anyone today
[4726.52 --> 4727.96]  who is feeling despair.
[4729.64 --> 4731.16]  May your glory shine,
[4731.64 --> 4732.88]  and may you fill them up.
[4733.08 --> 4733.36]  And Lord,
[4733.40 --> 4734.42]  may you be with them
[4734.42 --> 4735.94]  as they go through
[4735.94 --> 4736.62]  this hard
[4736.62 --> 4738.00]  and difficult emotion.
[4738.64 --> 4738.84]  And Lord,
[4738.88 --> 4739.50]  as the church,
[4739.62 --> 4740.82]  may we be your hands
[4740.82 --> 4741.22]  and feet
[4741.22 --> 4742.04]  in the lives
[4742.04 --> 4742.72]  of those struggling
[4742.72 --> 4743.72]  with despair right now.
[4744.32 --> 4744.98]  May we enter
[4744.98 --> 4747.20]  into that situation
[4747.20 --> 4749.08]  and be your presence there.
[4750.94 --> 4751.36]  God,
[4751.40 --> 4752.02]  we know you live.
[4753.46 --> 4754.36]  May we praise you
[4754.36 --> 4757.40]  in the light,
[4758.24 --> 4759.36]  and may we praise you
[4759.36 --> 4759.92]  in the darkness.

[5010.34 --> 5012.34]  as we leave this place today
[5012.34 --> 5015.34]  After talking about the hard emotion of despair
[5015.34 --> 5017.34]  May we know that our hope
[5017.34 --> 5020.34]  Is in the one who's all we need
[5020.34 --> 5022.34]  May we sing a song to the one who's all we need
[5022.34 --> 5025.34]  May we lift up our prayers and our cries
[5025.34 --> 5027.34]  To the one who's all we need
[5027.34 --> 5030.34]  Because we know that our Savior and Redeemer lives
[5030.34 --> 5034.34]  And our hope can be found in Him
[5034.34 --> 5036.34]  And that hope is assured
[5036.34 --> 5038.34]  So, may we go from this place
[5038.34 --> 5040.34]  Whether we are feeling despair
[5040.34 --> 5043.34]  Or whether we are helping those who are feeling despair
[5043.34 --> 5047.34]  With the understanding that Jesus is all we need
[5047.34 --> 5050.34]  Please hear this final blessing
[5050.34 --> 5053.34]  The priestly blessing from number six
