[0.00 --> 6.90]  Yeah, when did he break his promise? When did his kindness fail?
[7.24 --> 12.02]  Never has, never will, my God is still the same
[12.02 --> 18.82]  When did he lose his power? When did his mercy change?
[19.14 --> 23.64]  Never has, never will, my God is still the same
[23.64 --> 30.36]  Not once did he ever stop moving Not once has he ever let go
[30.36 --> 36.24]  Not once did he ever stop proving Our God is in control
[36.24 --> 42.10]  Not once did he ever stop moving Not once has he ever let go
[42.10 --> 47.82]  Not once did he ever stop proving Our God is in control
[47.82 --> 53.76]  When did he break his guns? When did his kindness fail?
[54.16 --> 58.86]  Never has, never will, my God is still the same.
[59.80 --> 65.60]  When did he lose his power? When did his mercy change?
[65.96 --> 70.40]  Never has, never will, my God is still the same.
[70.40 --> 77.26]  When did he ever stop moving? No one since he ever let go.
[77.62 --> 82.98]  No one since he ever stopped proving, my God is still the same.
[83.46 --> 88.92]  No one since he ever stopped moving, no one since he ever let go.
[88.92 --> 94.00]  Never has, never will, my God is still the same.
[100.40 --> 105.98]  My God is still the same.
[112.56 --> 117.40]  I know there's gonna be some brighter days.
[118.12 --> 122.76]  I swear that love will find you in your pain.
[123.76 --> 129.78]  I feel it in me like the beating of life in my veins.
[129.78 --> 134.00]  I know there's gonna be some brighter days.
[135.24 --> 139.70]  I know there's gonna be some brighter days.
[141.30 --> 145.18]  Oh, ashes fall from burning dreams.
[146.22 --> 150.80]  Oh, never live through times like these.
[150.80 --> 158.58]  Oh, if you're trying hard to breathe in the dark.
[158.58 --> 161.18]  In the dark.
[161.18 --> 167.52]  Oh, I know there's gonna be some brighter days.
[167.52 --> 172.92]  Yes, I swear that love will find you in your pain.
[172.92 --> 174.34]  Oh, oh, oh.
[174.34 --> 179.92]  I feel it in me like the beating of life in my veins.
[179.92 --> 184.38]  I know there's gonna be some brighter days.
[185.38 --> 189.98]  I know there's gonna be some brighter days.
[190.98 --> 196.38]  Oh, if your screams don't make a sound.
[196.38 --> 201.52]  Oh, if your walls are crashing down.
[201.52 --> 208.36]  Oh, if your heart just cries too loud all the time.
[209.20 --> 211.22]  All the time.
[211.62 --> 213.38]  Oh, oh, oh.
[213.38 --> 217.30]  I know there's gonna be some brighter days.
[217.30 --> 218.56]  Oh, brighter days.
[218.56 --> 248.54]  Oh, oh, oh.
[248.54 --> 251.58]  Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[251.58 --> 253.80]  I said brighter days.
[253.80 --> 257.92]  Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[257.92 --> 259.44]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[259.44 --> 262.50]  There's gonna be some brighter days.
[263.36 --> 268.26]  I know there's gonna be some brighter days.
[269.22 --> 273.48]  I swear that love will find you in your pain.
[273.48 --> 281.86]  I feel it in me like the beating of life in my veins.
[281.86 --> 282.86]  Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[282.86 --> 283.28]  Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[283.28 --> 283.36]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[283.36 --> 287.60]  I know there's gonna be some brighter days.
[288.00 --> 289.68]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[289.68 --> 291.98]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[291.98 --> 299.86]  I feel it in me like the beating of life in my veins
[299.86 --> 304.36]  I know there's gonna be some brighter days
[304.36 --> 309.92]  I know there's gonna be some brighter days
[309.92 --> 316.30]  I know there's gonna be some brighter days
[321.98 --> 351.96]  I know there's gonna be some brighter days
[351.98 --> 353.70]  Call me home
[353.70 --> 355.78]  Desesperado
[355.78 --> 358.84]  Oh, I'm desperate for your love
[358.84 --> 361.44]  Nothing else will ever be enough
[361.44 --> 364.30]  More than the air that's in my lungs
[364.30 --> 366.48]  Desesperado
[366.48 --> 369.40]  Oh, I'm desperate for your grace
[369.40 --> 371.86]  I need you and I'm under shame
[371.86 --> 374.86]  Breathe new life into my veins
[374.86 --> 376.86]  Desesperado
[376.86 --> 383.44]  Oh, I'm desperate I confess I'm a mess
[383.44 --> 386.08]  And I'm finally here at the end of myself
[386.08 --> 389.38]  Quería ser aventurero pero ya soy extranjero
[389.38 --> 391.44]  And now I'm calling out for help
[391.44 --> 393.44]  I'm getting lost too much
[393.44 --> 394.46]  I felt like I was doomed
[394.46 --> 396.60]  But my failures you turned around
[396.60 --> 398.52]  Spoke to these dry bones
[398.52 --> 399.24]  Desesperado
[399.24 --> 416.24]  Oh, I'm desperate for your love
[416.24 --> 418.24]  Nothing else will ever be enough
[418.24 --> 421.16]  More than the air that's in my lungs
[421.16 --> 421.92]  I'm breathing
[421.92 --> 423.24]  Desesperado
[423.24 --> 426.24]  Oh, I'm desperate for your grace
[426.78 --> 429.28]  I need you and I'm under shame
[429.28 --> 432.26]  Breathe new life into my veins
[432.26 --> 434.38]  Desesperado
[434.38 --> 437.00]  There's only one way I'll pull through
[437.00 --> 439.54]  If it's the last thing that I do
[439.54 --> 442.20]  I will breathe the driest desert
[442.20 --> 444.80]  If it leads me back to you
[444.80 --> 447.60]  I'm laying down my pride
[447.60 --> 450.06]  I'm giving you my life
[450.06 --> 453.30]  Without you I know I am
[453.30 --> 454.82]  Desesperado
[454.82 --> 457.94]  Oh, I'm desperate for your love
[457.94 --> 460.56]  Nothing else will ever be enough
[460.56 --> 463.42]  More than the air that's in my lungs
[463.42 --> 465.42]  Desesperado
[465.42 --> 468.52]  Oh, I'm desperate for your grace
[468.52 --> 470.96]  I need you and I'm under shame
[470.96 --> 474.14]  Breathe new life into my veins
[474.14 --> 475.42]  Desesperado
[476.08 --> 479.00]  You're the air that I'm breathing
[479.00 --> 480.42]  Desesperado
[481.50 --> 484.76]  I know I need you
[484.76 --> 486.42]  Desesperado
[486.42 --> 491.42]  Desesperado
[491.42 --> 493.42]  Oh
[493.42 --> 509.06]  I'll never be more loved than I am right now.
[509.06 --> 515.94]  Wasn't holding you up, so there's nothing I can do to let you down.
[515.94 --> 524.54]  It doesn't take a trophy to make you proud.
[524.54 --> 532.18]  I'll never be more loved than I am right now.
[532.18 --> 537.18]  Going through a storm, but I won't go down.
[537.18 --> 545.02]  I hear your voice carried in the rhythm of the wind to call me out.
[545.02 --> 552.26]  You would cross an ocean, so I wouldn't drown.
[552.26 --> 558.70]  You've never been closer than you are right now.
[558.70 --> 565.58]  Chira, you are in love.
[565.58 --> 572.02]  Chira, you are in love.
[572.02 --> 579.26]  And I will be content in every circumstance.
[579.26 --> 585.26]  Chira, you are in love.
[585.26 --> 588.50]  Forever enough, always enough.
[588.50 --> 593.50]  More than enough.
[593.50 --> 596.50]  I don't want to forget.
[596.50 --> 603.74]  Good morning.
[603.74 --> 605.74]  Let's try that again this morning.
[605.74 --> 606.74]  Morning.
[606.74 --> 607.74]  Hey.
[607.74 --> 608.74]  Nice work.
[608.74 --> 609.74]  Thank you all.
[609.74 --> 615.74]  I hope and trust that you are awake and ready to worship this morning.
[615.74 --> 619.98]  We had a welcome party here, not here, at the park last night.
[619.98 --> 622.98]  And some of us were swimming until nine o'clock.
[622.98 --> 625.98]  And so now's the time to wake up.
[625.98 --> 626.98]  Malachi.
[626.98 --> 631.98]  Perfect.
[631.98 --> 635.98]  In case you don't know, my name is Chris.
[635.98 --> 645.22]  I'm one of the pastors here, and it's my privilege, along with these others, to lead in our shared worship today.
[645.22 --> 654.98]  We are continuing an Ascension Day celebration that we started on Thursday, and we'll carry that theme through our worship together this morning.
[654.98 --> 661.98]  And so we are grateful for the opportunity to gather before we begin in earnest just a couple announcements.
[661.98 --> 668.98]  At some point in our service today, we are going to practice a fire drill.
[668.98 --> 673.98]  And so be ready, but you don't have to sit on the edge of your seat yet.
[673.98 --> 675.98]  That's all I'll say.
[675.98 --> 684.98]  In addition, if you are here in the worship space, when the fire alarm sounds, we will be exiting out either of these doors.
[684.98 --> 688.98]  So divide yourselves this way and that way and go there.
[688.98 --> 692.98]  Other instructions will be given at the point of that drill.
[692.98 --> 693.98]  So be ready.
[693.98 --> 705.98]  Also, just wanted to indicate that we are hosting here a kids' camp July 11 to 15 for kids aged 3 to 7.
[705.98 --> 707.98]  The sign-up for that has gone live.
[707.98 --> 709.98]  It went out in the e-bulletin.
[709.98 --> 713.98]  You can find it on our church website on the event page.
[713.98 --> 717.98]  Feel free to share that with family and friends.
[717.98 --> 723.98]  We do have a maximum of 30 spaces available, and we're already about halfway there.
[723.98 --> 730.98]  So take that to mind as you make your plans and go to register.
[730.98 --> 735.98]  Additionally, if you are visiting with us, we have these connect cards available.
[735.98 --> 737.98]  We encourage you to fill one out.
[737.98 --> 743.98]  You can find them on the back table there, or there's digital versions that you can scan with your phone and have access there.
[743.98 --> 749.98]  And then we'll be able to connect with you and welcome you into our church family as we worship together.
[749.98 --> 759.98]  With that said, I'm going to invite you, as you're able, to stand and we can be brought into the presence of our God for worship.
[759.98 --> 763.98]  Receive the greeting of our God.
[763.98 --> 775.98]  Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, our Ascended Savior, through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[775.98 --> 777.98]  Amen.
[777.98 --> 779.98]  Let's worship God.
[779.98 --> 785.98]  God calls us to worship this morning, and we'll do that responsively today.
[785.98 --> 790.98]  And so I will lead us in a bit of a reading here, and then at the end you will please join me in responding as well.
[790.98 --> 798.98]  Let us join our voices to praise the spotless Lamb, Jesus Christ, who has redeemed us from sin and death.
[798.98 --> 808.98]  We, whom he has redeemed, will sing praises and shout for joy this hour, because in Christ the Lamb, we have redemption through his blood,
[808.98 --> 813.98]  the forgiveness of our sins in accordance with the riches of his grace.
[813.98 --> 819.98]  Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us.
[819.98 --> 823.98]  Let us praise him by saying,
[823.98 --> 826.98]  Worthy is the Lamb who is slain,
[826.98 --> 834.98]  to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and praise.
[834.98 --> 844.98]  To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb, we give worship of his power and forever and ever. Amen.
[844.98 --> 872.98]  Who else commands all the hosts of heaven?
[872.98 --> 879.98]  Who else can make every king bow down?
[879.98 --> 885.98]  Who else can whisper and darkness trembles?
[885.98 --> 892.98]  Only a holy God.
[892.98 --> 898.98]  What other beauty demands such praises?
[898.98 --> 904.98]  What other splendor outshines the sun?
[904.98 --> 909.98]  What other majesty rules with justice?
[909.98 --> 915.98]  Only a holy God.
[915.98 --> 925.98]  Come and behold him, the one and the only.
[925.98 --> 934.98]  Cry out, sing holy, forever a holy God.
[934.98 --> 938.98]  Come and worship the holy God.
[938.98 --> 953.98]  What other glory consumes like fire.
[953.98 --> 959.98]  What other power can raise the dead.
[959.98 --> 961.98]  What other name remains undefeated?
[961.98 --> 964.98]  What other name remains undefeated?
[964.98 --> 966.98]  Only a holy God.
[966.98 --> 970.98]  Only a holy God.
[970.98 --> 980.98]  Come and behold him, the one and the only.
[980.98 --> 981.98]  Cry out, sing holy, the one and the only.
[981.98 --> 982.98]  Cry out, sing holy, forever a holy God.
[982.98 --> 987.98]  Come and behold him, the one and the only.
[987.98 --> 995.98]  Come and behold him, the one and the only.
[995.98 --> 1003.88]  Come and behold Him, the one and the only.
[1003.88 --> 1011.88]  Cry out, sing holy, forever a holy God.
[1012.96 --> 1016.62]  Come and worship the holy God.
[1025.98 --> 1031.12]  Who else could rescue me from my failing?
[1031.76 --> 1037.06]  Who else would offer His only Son?
[1038.58 --> 1042.94]  Who else invites me to call Him Father?
[1044.62 --> 1047.78]  Only a holy God.
[1049.28 --> 1052.46]  Only my holy God.
[1055.98 --> 1064.30]  Come and behold Him, the one and the only.
[1064.30 --> 1073.30]  Cry out, sing holy, forever a holy God.
[1073.68 --> 1077.80]  Come and worship the holy God.
[1077.80 --> 1087.24]  Come and behold Him, the one and the only.
[1088.34 --> 1096.90]  Cry out, sing holy, forever a holy God.
[1097.12 --> 1101.80]  Come and worship the holy God.
[1101.80 --> 1131.78]  Cry out, sing holy, forever a holy God.
[1131.78 --> 1137.00]  Lord God almighty.
[1138.10 --> 1147.84]  Early in the morning, our song shall rise to Thee.
[1147.84 --> 1157.84]  Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty.
[1157.84 --> 1166.84]  God in three persons, blessed Trinity.
[1166.84 --> 1173.84]  Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy.
[1173.84 --> 1178.84]  All the saints adore Thee.
[1178.84 --> 1187.84]  Casting down their golden crowns around the blessed sea.
[1187.84 --> 1208.08] ор might have faith in Full, surely, holy, holy, holy.
[1208.08 --> 1214.30]  Holy, holy, holy
[1214.30 --> 1220.54]  Though the darkness hide Thee
[1220.54 --> 1224.22]  Though the eye may blind
[1224.22 --> 1230.42]  By sin Thy glory may not see
[1230.42 --> 1236.32]  Only Thou art holy
[1236.32 --> 1242.32]  There is none beside Thee
[1242.32 --> 1251.66]  Perfect in power, in love and purity
[1251.66 --> 1258.70]  Holy, holy, holy
[1258.70 --> 1263.32]  Lord God Almighty
[1263.32 --> 1269.52]  All Thy works shall praise Thy name
[1269.52 --> 1274.32]  In earth and sky and sea
[1274.32 --> 1279.32]  Holy, holy, holy
[1279.32 --> 1285.32]  Merciful and mighty
[1285.32 --> 1290.32]  God in three persons
[1290.32 --> 1294.32]  Blessed Trinity
[1294.32 --> 1321.32]  Seeing that we have a great high priest who has entered the inmost heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us therefore approach the throne of grace with full confidence that we may receive mercy for all of our failures and grace to help in the hour of need. In the strength of this assurance, let us confess our sins to God in a moment of silent prayer.
[1321.32 --> 1324.32]  Amen.
[1324.32 --> 1325.32]  Amen.
[1325.32 --> 1326.32]  Amen.
[1326.32 --> 1328.32]  Amen.

[1570.32 --> 1572.32]  Thank you.
[1572.32 --> 1574.32]  Thank you.
[1574.32 --> 1576.32]  Thank you.
[1576.32 --> 1578.32]  Thank you.
[1578.32 --> 1580.32]  Thank you.
[1580.32 --> 1582.32]  Thank you.
[1582.32 --> 1584.32]  Thank you.
[1584.32 --> 1586.32]  Thank you.
[1586.32 --> 1588.32]  Thank you.
[1588.32 --> 1590.32]  Thank you.
[1590.32 --> 1592.32]  Thank you.
[1592.32 --> 1594.32]  Thank you.
[1594.32 --> 1596.32]  Thank you.

[1604.32 --> 1608.32]  Thank you.
[1608.32 --> 1612.32]  Oh, sing hallelujah
[1612.32 --> 1617.52]  Our hope springs eternal, all sing.
[1618.52 --> 1623.94]  Hallelujah, now and never we confess.
[1623.94 --> 1627.94]  Christ our hope in life and death.
[1633.98 --> 1639.20]  But truth can't calm the troubled soul.
[1639.20 --> 1643.36]  God is good, God is good.
[1643.74 --> 1647.70]  Where is His grace and goodness flow?
[1647.70 --> 1652.20]  All our graves make demons fly.
[1652.56 --> 1656.60]  Who holds our faith when fears arise?
[1656.94 --> 1660.92]  Who stands above the stormy trial?
[1661.32 --> 1665.48]  Who sends the waves that bring us nigh?
[1665.48 --> 1671.32]  Unto the shore of the rock of Christ.
[1672.52 --> 1676.18]  Oh, sing hallelujah.
[1677.18 --> 1680.52]  Our hope springs eternal.
[1681.18 --> 1684.82]  Oh, sing hallelujah.
[1684.82 --> 1688.82]  Now and never we confess.
[1689.16 --> 1692.82]  Christ our hope in life and death.
[1696.52 --> 1701.24]  Unto the grave what will we sing?
[1701.70 --> 1705.80]  Christ He lives, Christ He lives.
[1705.80 --> 1710.68]  And what reward will heaven bring?
[1712.44 --> 1714.64]  Everlasting life within.
[1715.68 --> 1719.86]  There we will rise to meet the Lord.
[1720.22 --> 1723.80]  Then sin and death will be destroyed.
[1724.54 --> 1728.76]  And we will feast in endless joy.
[1728.76 --> 1733.76]  When Christ is ours forevermore.
[1733.76 --> 1739.76]  Oh, sing hallelujah.
[1739.76 --> 1743.76]  Our hope springs eternal.
[1743.76 --> 1747.76]  Oh, sing hallelujah.
[1747.76 --> 1751.76]  Now and never we confess.
[1751.76 --> 1752.24]  Now and never we confess.
[1752.24 --> 1755.96]  Christ our hope in life and death.
[1755.96 --> 1759.96]  Oh, sing hallelujah.
[1759.96 --> 1763.76]  Our hope springs eternal.
[1763.76 --> 1767.76]  Oh, sing hallelujah.
[1767.76 --> 1771.76]  Now and never we confess.
[1771.76 --> 1775.76]  Christ our hope in life and death.
[1775.76 --> 1778.76]  Now and never we confess.
[1778.76 --> 1783.76]  Christ our hope in life and death.
[1786.76 --> 1788.28]  You may have a seat.
[1801.76 --> 1814.00]  Today's offerings are for the budget of Emmanuel and Teen Challenge.
[1814.76 --> 1821.76]  Teen Challenge is a Christian organization that helps adults and teens overcome addiction.
[1821.76 --> 1831.76]  They believe that God is the candidate for change for people with life-controlling drug and alcohol problems.
[1832.76 --> 1835.76]  Treatment is important, but transformation is key.
[1836.76 --> 1843.76]  The program depends on the power of God's word to provide people with a guiding light.
[1844.76 --> 1848.76]  They come to recognize the Holy Spirit's work in their lives.
[1848.76 --> 1851.76]  This often takes time.
[1851.76 --> 1853.76]  Give as the Lord has given you.
[1853.76 --> 1860.76]  Next week's offering is for the budget and C-10 commission to every nation.

[1880.76 --> 1881.76]  We have to advance the possibility of God once again.
[1881.76 --> 1886.76]  This is the I will be an planned to resonate with others.
[1887.76 --> 1889.76]  And as you are honored to dwell on that we canожет masters basis betweenдose and spiritual and spiritual.
[1889.76 --> 1898.58]  You spoke the earth into motion, my soul now to stand.
[1902.38 --> 1913.46]  You stood me for my failure, and carried the cross for my shame.
[1913.46 --> 1923.20]  I said, wait upon your shoulders, my soul now to stand.
[1926.28 --> 1928.72]  So what can I say?
[1932.46 --> 1935.60]  What can I do?
[1935.60 --> 1949.60]  I offer this heart, O God, completely to you.
[1949.60 --> 1962.82]  So I'll walk upon salvation, your spirit alive in me.
[1964.34 --> 1971.60]  My life to declare your promise, my soul now to stand.
[1971.60 --> 1977.60]  So what can I say?
[1980.60 --> 1983.60]  And what can I do?
[1987.60 --> 1996.60]  But offer this heart, O God, completely to you.
[1996.60 --> 2001.60]  So what can I say?
[2005.60 --> 2007.60]  And what can I do?
[2007.60 --> 2021.60]  And offer this heart, O God, completely to you.
[2021.60 --> 2024.60]  Please do this.
[2024.60 --> 2037.48]  So I'll stand with arms I've won't abandon.
[2037.60 --> 2043.60]  I'll give up the one who gave it all.
[2043.60 --> 2048.60]  And I'll stand with arms I've won't abandon.
[2048.60 --> 2051.60]  So I'll give up the one who gave it all.
[2051.60 --> 2055.60]  And I'll stand with arms I've won't abandon.
[2055.60 --> 2061.40]  I'll stand with arms high and heart abandoned
[2061.40 --> 2067.84]  In all of the blood you gave it all
[2067.84 --> 2073.90]  I'll stand as your Lord you surrendered all
[2073.90 --> 2077.68]  My hand is yours
[2077.68 --> 2085.30]  I'll stand with arms high and heart abandoned
[2085.30 --> 2092.24]  In all of the one who gave it all
[2092.24 --> 2098.68]  I'll stand my soul Lord you surrendered all
[2098.68 --> 2102.68]  I am is yours
[2102.68 --> 2107.40]  Please have a seat
[2115.30 --> 2124.68]  Good morning everyone
[2124.68 --> 2126.98]  Anyone else that doesn't realize what's going on here
[2126.98 --> 2129.42]  It's Kids Corner come on up front
[2129.42 --> 2132.00]  You knew what it was right away
[2132.00 --> 2133.24]  Okay good
[2133.24 --> 2135.32]  Alright today
[2135.32 --> 2136.52]  Good to see you guys
[2136.52 --> 2139.32]  Was everybody at the party yesterday?
[2140.12 --> 2140.82]  Was it good?
[2141.38 --> 2141.92]  You weren't?
[2142.00 --> 2142.58]  Was it good?
[2143.04 --> 2144.14]  How many people went swimming?
[2144.14 --> 2147.18]  Was the water cold or was it fancy?
[2148.48 --> 2148.88]  What?
[2150.08 --> 2151.32]  Tax dollars at work
[2151.32 --> 2151.92]  That's good
[2151.92 --> 2158.34]  Today we are talking about the book of Isaiah in the Bible
[2158.34 --> 2161.64]  Does anybody know, have ever heard of the book Isaiah in the Bible?
[2161.86 --> 2162.76]  Isaiah you've heard of it?
[2163.32 --> 2163.54]  Yeah?
[2164.24 --> 2168.60]  Who has an idea of whether it's in the Old Testament or the New Testament in the Bible?
[2168.94 --> 2169.16]  Yeah?
[2169.16 --> 2171.94]  Do you think it's the New?
[2171.94 --> 2172.42]  What do you think?
[2173.00 --> 2174.24]  It's in the Old Testament
[2174.24 --> 2183.74]  Now when I opened up my book to read the get prepared for this story it said Isaiah and it gave a definition of what his name means
[2183.74 --> 2185.58]  You probably don't know what that means
[2185.58 --> 2187.00]  Does anybody here name Isaiah?
[2187.46 --> 2189.22]  Or a middle name named Isaiah?
[2189.22 --> 2192.50]  Isaiah means God to the rescue
[2192.50 --> 2195.36]  So this story is going to be a bit about God rescue
[2195.36 --> 2197.48]  Doing some rescue work in the Bible
[2197.48 --> 2198.06]  Now
[2198.06 --> 2201.72]  I was thinking about names for a minute here
[2201.72 --> 2202.46]  And I thought
[2202.46 --> 2205.10]  Does everybody here know what their name means?
[2206.10 --> 2208.00]  You got a pretty good idea what your name means?
[2208.64 --> 2209.64]  Zoe what does your name mean?
[2209.64 --> 2215.18]  That's right
[2215.18 --> 2216.24]  Because I looked up your name
[2216.24 --> 2219.58]  Because you're one of my biggest contributors to helping me answer questions here
[2219.58 --> 2221.90]  Your name means eternal life or life
[2221.90 --> 2223.22]  Do you know what your name means?
[2226.04 --> 2226.60]  Uh oh
[2226.60 --> 2229.00]  So that probably means not bitter
[2229.00 --> 2230.14]  Not bitter, right?
[2230.26 --> 2230.62]  Amara
[2230.62 --> 2233.98]  I got another one here
[2233.98 --> 2235.40]  Is Malachi sitting here right now?
[2235.46 --> 2235.78]  Where is he?
[2236.00 --> 2236.66]  He's up here
[2236.66 --> 2237.88]  Malachi do you know what your name is?
[2237.92 --> 2239.34]  Oh and you're Malachi too
[2239.34 --> 2240.10]  What does your name mean?
[2242.70 --> 2243.32]  That's right
[2243.32 --> 2244.18]  Your mom's
[2244.18 --> 2245.46]  Your mom's right on this one
[2245.46 --> 2247.50]  Your mom should come up here and hang out with us
[2247.50 --> 2247.96]  Yeah
[2247.96 --> 2263.82]  Good work
[2263.82 --> 2264.78]  Nice
[2264.78 --> 2265.48]  Now
[2265.48 --> 2267.24]  How about some of the old people out there?
[2267.32 --> 2267.60]  You want to
[2267.60 --> 2268.16]  I have
[2268.16 --> 2268.76]  Where's Clem?
[2268.82 --> 2269.18]  Where are you?
[2269.18 --> 2269.92]  I saw you out there
[2269.92 --> 2270.50]  Wave your hand
[2270.50 --> 2270.96]  Where is he?
[2271.62 --> 2272.24]  Where's Clem?
[2272.80 --> 2273.60]  Clem's in the back
[2273.60 --> 2274.00]  Clem
[2274.00 --> 2275.66]  I'm trying to get your attention
[2275.66 --> 2278.12]  See that guy in the very back there?
[2278.94 --> 2280.36]  What do you think his name means?
[2282.10 --> 2283.74]  Merciful or famous one
[2283.74 --> 2284.86]  What are we going with Clem?
[2288.92 --> 2290.02]  And somebody else
[2290.02 --> 2290.82]  Lena in the back
[2290.82 --> 2291.64]  She's just up front
[2291.64 --> 2293.04]  Does anybody know what Lena means?
[2293.10 --> 2294.96]  It means light or torch
[2294.96 --> 2297.94]  But I got another cool name tidbit for you
[2297.94 --> 2300.30]  Guess what name is the most popular in this church?
[2301.64 --> 2305.18]  If you see anyone around here with a little bit no hair or grey hair
[2305.18 --> 2306.60]  Their name probably is
[2306.60 --> 2308.10]  John
[2308.10 --> 2311.64]  There you go
[2311.64 --> 2313.80]  And God means God is gracious
[2313.80 --> 2315.68]  So today we're going to learn about Isaiah
[2315.68 --> 2317.74]  And his name is God to the rescue
[2317.74 --> 2321.26]  So why don't we all stand up and give the blessing
[2321.26 --> 2328.40]  All right

[2494.72 --> 2501.92]  who have been affected many in our community also continue to grieve as well we continue to pray for
[2501.92 --> 2508.34]  those who are dealing with the loss of loved ones in our denomination Lord we pray for the sit-in meeting

[2514.76 --> 2522.40]  the lord is my shepherd I shall not be in want he makes me lie down in green pastures and leaves me beside quiet water and
[2522.40 --> 2523.44]  restores my soul
[2523.44 --> 2524.10]  amen
[2544.76 --> 2565.24]  before we jump into the sermon text I just wanted to take a moment and say thank you to all of you and to those who were involved in planning and preparing and pulling off the community barbecue last night in the welcome event
[2565.24 --> 2578.60]  we all recognize that the last year and a half have been strange and weird and not the way we would have liked to spend our life and our time getting to know each other and yet
[2578.60 --> 2586.62]  even without last night's event I can say with confidence on behalf of our family that we feel
[2586.62 --> 2594.92]  so welcomed and loved and we appreciate all of you very much and we're grateful that we got to acknowledge that last night
[2594.92 --> 2599.14]  but we didn't require any of that
[2599.14 --> 2603.02]  and I'm also for those of you who
[2603.02 --> 2604.50]  wrote cards
[2604.50 --> 2605.86]  thank you
[2605.86 --> 2610.02]  I'm not a thank you card person this is my thank you card
[2610.02 --> 2615.04]  this morning
[2615.04 --> 2617.40]  we are going to
[2617.40 --> 2619.16]  think about
[2619.16 --> 2620.98]  ascension day
[2620.98 --> 2621.78]  together
[2621.78 --> 2623.38]  now if you are
[2623.38 --> 2624.24]  unfamiliar
[2624.24 --> 2629.40]  with the the movement of the church year through the Christian calendar
[2629.40 --> 2631.38]  or if you
[2631.38 --> 2636.62]  are not really a churchgoer and this is your first time in church or you're coming back to church for a while anyway
[2636.62 --> 2637.62]  ascension day
[2637.62 --> 2642.68]  ascension day is the the day that we remember and
[2642.68 --> 2645.24]  reflect on
[2645.24 --> 2653.00]  Jesus ascending going back up to heaven to the right hand of the father we say in the apostles creed
[2653.00 --> 2653.98]  now
[2653.98 --> 2661.30]  ascension day was this past thursday and we had a prayer and praise evening a number of us
[2661.30 --> 2662.54]  gathered
[2662.54 --> 2666.70]  to mark that day and to reflect on that
[2666.70 --> 2667.60]  but
[2667.60 --> 2671.04]  what I am mindful of is that
[2671.04 --> 2677.10]  in the sort of normal flow of our life and faith together
[2677.10 --> 2678.96]  ascension day
[2678.96 --> 2683.80]  can easily become that sort of forgotten holiday
[2683.80 --> 2687.62]  can easily become that sort of forgotten liturgical
[2687.62 --> 2690.28]  part of
[2690.28 --> 2691.24]  our worship
[2691.24 --> 2692.32]  now
[2692.32 --> 2696.48]  we have Christmas and we have Easter and
[2696.48 --> 2700.56]  fortunately or unfortunately I'll let you wrestle through that
[2700.56 --> 2704.56]  the reality is those two times of year there's a whole bunch of like cultural
[2704.56 --> 2706.90]  fanfare right like even if you're not
[2706.90 --> 2710.16]  Christian there's things to do and and that's marked
[2710.16 --> 2712.26]  none of that happens
[2712.26 --> 2713.88]  on ascension day
[2713.88 --> 2716.14]  as I was thinking this week
[2716.14 --> 2718.78]  perhaps that's why
[2718.78 --> 2722.70]  we don't really reflect that often or we don't really think about that
[2722.70 --> 2723.56]  very deeply
[2723.56 --> 2724.84]  and yet
[2724.84 --> 2726.84]  if that's why
[2726.84 --> 2729.14]  kind of a sad indicator
[2729.14 --> 2732.64]  and so we wanted to be intentional
[2732.64 --> 2734.46]  and to think about that because
[2734.46 --> 2736.30]  in sort of traditional
[2736.30 --> 2738.46]  reformed theology
[2738.46 --> 2740.04]  ascension day
[2740.04 --> 2742.22]  has actually always been highlighted
[2742.22 --> 2743.54]  as the sort of
[2743.54 --> 2745.42]  capstone of the ministry
[2745.42 --> 2746.40]  of Jesus
[2746.40 --> 2746.82]  in fact
[2746.82 --> 2748.46]  it's on par with
[2748.46 --> 2750.32]  or perhaps even outstrips
[2750.32 --> 2752.34]  depending on which theologians you read
[2752.34 --> 2753.46]  Christmas and Easter
[2753.46 --> 2755.86]  we haven't carried that through
[2755.86 --> 2756.56]  and so
[2756.56 --> 2759.92]  not with your permission
[2759.92 --> 2761.00]  because I'm going to do it regardless
[2761.00 --> 2762.24]  but with your grace
[2762.24 --> 2764.92]  I want to take just a couple minutes
[2764.92 --> 2765.94]  and
[2765.94 --> 2767.68]  and undergird
[2767.68 --> 2770.12]  a theology of ascension day
[2770.12 --> 2773.14]  and so we're going to talk a little bit of theology
[2773.14 --> 2774.16]  and historical theology
[2774.16 --> 2776.02]  but I just want three minutes of your attention
[2776.02 --> 2776.98]  and then we'll
[2776.98 --> 2778.52]  dig into our text
[2778.52 --> 2780.56]  as this becomes sort of foundational for that
[2780.56 --> 2782.42]  so give me your best selves for a moment
[2782.42 --> 2783.32]  as we
[2783.32 --> 2784.58]  dig into this
[2784.58 --> 2787.96]  so we talked about how this is a traditional
[2787.96 --> 2789.24]  reformed
[2789.24 --> 2790.58]  theological idea
[2790.58 --> 2791.80]  and so when I say that
[2791.80 --> 2793.48]  we'll just go right to John Calvin
[2793.48 --> 2795.14]  because if you quote Calvin in a sermon
[2795.14 --> 2796.22]  it's going to be a good one
[2796.22 --> 2799.60]  there was more groaning than laughing there
[2799.60 --> 2800.76]  appreciate that
[2800.76 --> 2804.46]  John Calvin is a
[2804.46 --> 2807.06]  16th century reformer of church
[2807.06 --> 2807.76]  he's sort of
[2807.76 --> 2808.74]  pivotal for
[2808.74 --> 2811.28]  our understanding of how to read the Bible
[2811.28 --> 2812.88]  and has shaped who we are
[2812.88 --> 2814.80]  as a Christian reformed church
[2814.80 --> 2816.22]  in really impactful ways
[2816.22 --> 2817.66]  and he says
[2817.66 --> 2819.24]  of ascension day
[2819.24 --> 2820.50]  first
[2820.50 --> 2822.62]  that by his ascension
[2822.62 --> 2824.50]  Jesus opened up
[2824.50 --> 2825.40]  the access
[2825.40 --> 2826.72]  to the heavenly kingdom
[2826.72 --> 2827.98]  which Adam
[2827.98 --> 2828.92]  had shut
[2828.92 --> 2832.64]  and so what he's saying there is
[2832.64 --> 2833.74]  because he
[2833.74 --> 2834.58]  that is Jesus
[2834.58 --> 2835.52]  because Jesus
[2835.52 --> 2836.66]  is in heaven
[2836.66 --> 2838.38]  as a man
[2838.38 --> 2839.60]  an incarnate
[2839.60 --> 2840.46]  person
[2840.46 --> 2841.00]  right
[2841.00 --> 2842.46]  we here and now
[2842.46 --> 2844.04]  don't merely have the hope
[2844.04 --> 2844.72]  of heaven
[2844.72 --> 2846.42]  but we already
[2846.42 --> 2847.60]  possess it
[2847.60 --> 2849.52]  in our head
[2849.52 --> 2850.20]  that is in
[2850.20 --> 2850.92]  Jesus
[2850.92 --> 2852.00]  who is the head
[2852.00 --> 2852.76]  right
[2852.76 --> 2853.22]  we
[2853.22 --> 2854.44]  are seated
[2854.44 --> 2856.04]  in heavenly places
[2856.04 --> 2857.76]  humanity
[2857.76 --> 2858.90]  fleshliness
[2858.90 --> 2861.00]  is already
[2861.00 --> 2862.62]  in heaven
[2862.62 --> 2865.04]  it's one of the reasons why ascension day
[2865.04 --> 2866.14]  is so powerful
[2866.14 --> 2867.32]  second
[2867.32 --> 2867.84]  Calvin
[2867.84 --> 2868.94]  says
[2868.94 --> 2870.96]  having entered the temple
[2870.96 --> 2872.38]  not made with hands
[2872.38 --> 2873.88]  he constantly appears
[2873.88 --> 2874.96]  as our advocate
[2874.96 --> 2876.36]  and intercessor
[2876.36 --> 2877.62]  in the presence
[2877.62 --> 2878.42]  of the father
[2878.42 --> 2880.72]  now
[2880.72 --> 2882.68]  the wrath of God
[2882.68 --> 2883.12]  for
[2883.12 --> 2884.04]  sin
[2884.04 --> 2885.98]  is turned away
[2885.98 --> 2887.16]  actively
[2887.16 --> 2889.30]  because of what Jesus
[2889.30 --> 2890.56]  accomplished on the cross
[2890.56 --> 2892.06]  but presently
[2892.06 --> 2893.50]  in my life
[2893.50 --> 2893.96]  because
[2893.96 --> 2895.38]  he is standing
[2895.38 --> 2896.64]  in front of the father
[2896.64 --> 2897.72]  saying
[2897.72 --> 2898.70]  father
[2898.70 --> 2899.94]  look at me
[2899.94 --> 2901.28]  look at my
[2901.28 --> 2901.98]  righteousness
[2901.98 --> 2902.94]  look at my
[2902.94 --> 2903.62]  perfection
[2903.62 --> 2905.32]  such that when the father
[2905.32 --> 2905.76]  sees
[2905.76 --> 2906.86]  or looks to me
[2906.86 --> 2907.58]  he sees
[2907.58 --> 2908.44]  Jesus
[2908.44 --> 2910.78]  that's because of
[2910.78 --> 2912.12]  the ascension
[2912.12 --> 2913.46]  possible because of
[2913.46 --> 2914.52]  the ascension
[2914.52 --> 2916.42]  Calvin goes on
[2916.42 --> 2917.68]  he quotes
[2917.68 --> 2918.80]  Ephesians 4
[2918.80 --> 2919.60]  verse 8
[2919.60 --> 2920.14]  which says
[2920.14 --> 2920.72]  when he
[2920.72 --> 2921.18]  Jesus
[2921.18 --> 2922.16]  ascended up
[2922.16 --> 2922.80]  on high
[2922.80 --> 2923.32]  he led
[2923.32 --> 2924.08]  captivity
[2924.08 --> 2924.96]  captive
[2924.96 --> 2926.14]  which is a beautiful phrase
[2926.14 --> 2927.48]  and Calvin says
[2927.48 --> 2927.90]  of that
[2927.90 --> 2929.24]  spoiling his
[2929.24 --> 2930.00]  foes
[2930.00 --> 2931.24]  he gave gifts
[2931.24 --> 2932.14]  to his people
[2932.14 --> 2933.30]  and daily
[2933.30 --> 2934.28]  loads them
[2934.28 --> 2935.38]  with spiritual
[2935.38 --> 2936.50]  riches
[2936.50 --> 2937.80]  right
[2937.80 --> 2938.40]  and what Calvin's
[2938.40 --> 2938.96]  point is here
[2938.96 --> 2940.30]  because Christ
[2940.30 --> 2940.98]  ascended
[2940.98 --> 2941.76]  we
[2941.76 --> 2942.64]  the church
[2942.64 --> 2943.48]  his people
[2943.48 --> 2944.54]  are given
[2944.54 --> 2945.34]  the Holy
[2945.34 --> 2946.24]  Spirit
[2946.24 --> 2947.44]  right
[2947.44 --> 2947.84]  Jesus
[2947.84 --> 2948.76]  as ascended
[2948.76 --> 2949.28]  to the right
[2949.28 --> 2950.00]  hand of the father
[2950.00 --> 2951.12]  along with the father
[2951.12 --> 2952.40]  sends the spirit
[2952.40 --> 2953.60]  so that we can be
[2953.60 --> 2954.42]  quickened
[2954.42 --> 2955.38]  to newness
[2955.38 --> 2956.04]  of life
[2956.04 --> 2956.76]  so that we can be
[2956.76 --> 2957.94]  raised from death
[2957.94 --> 2958.60]  into life
[2958.60 --> 2959.12]  so that we can be
[2959.12 --> 2959.94]  brought into
[2959.94 --> 2960.68]  holiness
[2960.68 --> 2961.20]  so we can be
[2961.20 --> 2962.04]  granted grace
[2962.04 --> 2962.88]  upon grace
[2962.88 --> 2964.30]  so that we can be
[2964.30 --> 2964.92]  equipped
[2964.92 --> 2966.14]  as a church
[2966.14 --> 2966.90]  for a life
[2966.90 --> 2967.52]  of mission
[2967.52 --> 2968.80]  in the now
[2968.80 --> 2969.92]  enthroned
[2969.92 --> 2970.90]  kingdom of God
[2970.90 --> 2971.74]  and the kingdom
[2971.74 --> 2972.22]  of God
[2972.22 --> 2972.66]  that has
[2972.66 --> 2974.16]  its king
[2974.16 --> 2974.94]  seated
[2974.94 --> 2976.16]  on the throne
[2976.16 --> 2977.54]  Calvin finishes
[2977.54 --> 2978.14]  by saying
[2978.14 --> 2979.24]  our redemption
[2979.24 --> 2980.00]  was fully
[2980.00 --> 2980.82]  completely
[2980.82 --> 2981.80]  and finished
[2981.80 --> 2983.12]  then when Christ
[2983.12 --> 2984.36]  did ascend
[2984.36 --> 2985.78]  unto the father
[2985.78 --> 2988.00]  without ascension
[2988.00 --> 2988.36]  day
[2988.36 --> 2989.98]  redemption
[2989.98 --> 2990.90]  is not complete
[2990.90 --> 2992.38]  or finished
[2992.38 --> 2994.18]  now if you want
[2994.18 --> 2994.64]  to dig even
[2994.64 --> 2995.58]  deeper into this
[2995.58 --> 2996.30]  the Heidelberg
[2996.30 --> 2996.84]  Catechism
[2996.84 --> 2997.60]  which is another
[2997.60 --> 2998.70]  document that helps
[2998.70 --> 2999.38]  us understand
[2999.38 --> 3000.02]  who we are
[3000.02 --> 3001.10]  question and answer
[3001.10 --> 3001.72]  49
[3001.72 --> 3003.36]  takes these
[3003.36 --> 3004.04]  ideas
[3004.04 --> 3004.96]  these truths
[3004.96 --> 3006.44]  and summarizes
[3006.44 --> 3006.80]  them
[3006.80 --> 3008.38]  in answer to
[3008.38 --> 3009.02]  the question
[3009.02 --> 3010.32]  how does Christ's
[3010.32 --> 3010.78]  ascension
[3010.78 --> 3012.12]  benefit us
[3012.12 --> 3013.14]  saying that He's
[3013.14 --> 3013.74]  an advocate to
[3013.74 --> 3014.16]  the Father
[3014.16 --> 3014.68]  that we have
[3014.68 --> 3015.22]  our own flesh
[3015.22 --> 3015.66]  in heaven
[3015.66 --> 3016.52]  and that from
[3016.52 --> 3017.44]  there He sends
[3017.44 --> 3018.36]  the Holy Spirit
[3018.36 --> 3021.10]  okay
[3021.10 --> 3022.78]  you made it
[3022.78 --> 3024.58]  here's why that
[3024.58 --> 3025.24]  matters for us
[3025.24 --> 3025.64]  this morning
[3025.64 --> 3027.34]  worship
[3027.34 --> 3027.52]  worship
[3027.52 --> 3028.34]  that is
[3028.34 --> 3028.96]  this
[3028.96 --> 3029.50]  what we are
[3029.50 --> 3030.08]  doing right
[3030.08 --> 3030.50]  here
[3030.50 --> 3031.26]  and right
[3031.26 --> 3031.50]  now
[3031.50 --> 3032.40]  this gathering
[3032.40 --> 3033.52]  together
[3033.52 --> 3035.70]  not only
[3035.70 --> 3037.42]  reminds us
[3037.42 --> 3039.64]  of who Jesus
[3039.64 --> 3040.46]  is and what
[3040.46 --> 3041.40]  He has accomplished
[3041.40 --> 3042.24]  in the ascension
[3042.24 --> 3044.02]  but also
[3044.02 --> 3045.82]  invites us
[3045.82 --> 3047.12]  to participate
[3047.12 --> 3047.66]  in it
[3047.66 --> 3048.36]  worship
[3048.36 --> 3049.36]  and so
[3049.36 --> 3052.30]  what I'm
[3052.30 --> 3052.72]  going to say
[3052.72 --> 3053.30]  this morning
[3053.30 --> 3055.08]  is that there
[3055.08 --> 3056.00]  is nothing
[3056.00 --> 3057.28]  ordinary
[3057.28 --> 3058.90]  about
[3058.90 --> 3059.70]  ordinary
[3059.70 --> 3060.44]  worship
[3060.44 --> 3063.22]  and so take
[3063.22 --> 3063.92]  those ideas
[3063.92 --> 3065.48]  about ascension
[3065.48 --> 3065.86]  day
[3065.86 --> 3067.52]  hold the three
[3067.52 --> 3068.10]  of those things
[3068.10 --> 3068.68]  in your mind
[3068.68 --> 3069.52]  but sort of
[3069.52 --> 3069.98]  for now
[3069.98 --> 3070.40]  at least
[3070.40 --> 3071.00]  park them
[3071.00 --> 3071.68]  in the back
[3071.68 --> 3072.18]  of your brain
[3072.18 --> 3072.50]  because we're
[3072.50 --> 3072.86]  going to pull
[3072.86 --> 3073.36]  that thread
[3073.36 --> 3073.80]  back out
[3073.80 --> 3074.72]  in the end
[3074.72 --> 3076.34]  but hear this
[3076.34 --> 3077.00]  there's nothing
[3077.00 --> 3077.78]  ordinary
[3077.78 --> 3078.80]  about
[3078.80 --> 3079.58]  ordinary
[3079.58 --> 3080.70]  worship
[3080.70 --> 3082.20]  now
[3082.20 --> 3083.22]  I realize
[3083.22 --> 3083.56]  we might need
[3083.56 --> 3084.04]  some clarity
[3084.04 --> 3084.32]  there
[3084.32 --> 3084.88]  like when I
[3084.88 --> 3085.46]  say
[3085.46 --> 3086.26]  ordinary
[3086.26 --> 3086.76]  worship
[3086.76 --> 3087.38]  why am I
[3087.38 --> 3088.06]  calling it
[3088.06 --> 3088.64]  ordinary
[3088.64 --> 3090.20]  because
[3090.20 --> 3091.16]  you know
[3091.16 --> 3091.66]  someone might
[3091.66 --> 3092.04]  ask you
[3092.04 --> 3092.62]  how was church
[3092.62 --> 3093.18]  today
[3093.18 --> 3094.16]  and you go
[3094.16 --> 3094.64]  oh you know
[3094.64 --> 3095.78]  it was ordinary
[3095.78 --> 3097.36]  there was nothing
[3097.36 --> 3098.36]  special that happened
[3098.36 --> 3098.70]  there was
[3098.70 --> 3099.26]  there was no
[3099.26 --> 3099.88]  baptisms
[3099.88 --> 3100.46]  there was no
[3100.46 --> 3101.64]  speaking in tongues
[3101.64 --> 3103.10]  old man Tony
[3103.10 --> 3103.82]  didn't even say
[3103.82 --> 3104.62]  something inappropriate
[3104.62 --> 3107.26]  but
[3107.26 --> 3108.70]  more than that
[3108.70 --> 3109.80]  in again
[3109.80 --> 3110.42]  traditional
[3110.42 --> 3111.26]  reformed
[3111.26 --> 3111.72]  theology
[3111.72 --> 3113.26]  we talk about
[3113.26 --> 3113.64]  together
[3113.64 --> 3114.68]  the ordinary
[3114.68 --> 3116.06]  means of grace
[3116.06 --> 3117.82]  right
[3117.82 --> 3118.24]  the ordinary
[3118.24 --> 3119.26]  means of grace
[3119.26 --> 3120.34]  being the word
[3120.34 --> 3121.04]  and worship
[3121.04 --> 3122.46]  and sacrament
[3122.46 --> 3123.66]  and we mean
[3123.66 --> 3124.24]  ordinary
[3124.24 --> 3125.74]  not because
[3125.74 --> 3126.10]  they're
[3126.10 --> 3127.30]  not extraordinary
[3127.30 --> 3128.04]  but because
[3128.04 --> 3128.64]  they're regular
[3128.64 --> 3129.86]  like we ordinarily
[3129.86 --> 3130.74]  do them this way
[3130.74 --> 3133.42]  and yet
[3133.42 --> 3135.06]  as we talk
[3135.06 --> 3135.68]  about worship
[3135.68 --> 3137.40]  and as we talk
[3137.40 --> 3138.20]  about worship
[3138.20 --> 3138.90]  in light of the
[3138.90 --> 3139.40]  ascension
[3139.40 --> 3140.76]  if your
[3140.76 --> 3141.52]  expectations
[3141.52 --> 3142.08]  are what
[3142.08 --> 3142.74]  of what's
[3142.74 --> 3143.42]  happening here
[3143.42 --> 3144.30]  in this place
[3144.30 --> 3145.52]  are just
[3145.52 --> 3146.04]  ordinary
[3146.04 --> 3148.34]  you're missing
[3148.34 --> 3148.82]  the point
[3148.82 --> 3151.04]  we're going to
[3151.04 --> 3151.86]  make that point
[3151.86 --> 3153.24]  by looking
[3153.24 --> 3154.50]  at revelation
[3154.50 --> 3154.88]  four
[3154.88 --> 3155.38]  and so if you
[3155.38 --> 3156.68]  have a bible
[3156.68 --> 3158.36]  really invite you
[3158.36 --> 3159.34]  to open that up
[3159.34 --> 3159.96]  to have it
[3159.96 --> 3160.48]  we will have it
[3160.48 --> 3161.06]  on the screen
[3161.06 --> 3161.82]  but we will flip
[3161.82 --> 3162.46]  around in a few
[3162.46 --> 3162.84]  places
[3162.84 --> 3164.06]  the book of
[3164.06 --> 3164.80]  revelation is the
[3164.80 --> 3165.64]  last book in the
[3165.64 --> 3166.46]  bible so if you
[3166.46 --> 3167.26]  just open it
[3167.26 --> 3168.18]  like a jewish
[3168.18 --> 3168.80]  person from the
[3168.80 --> 3169.44]  back you'll find
[3169.44 --> 3170.18]  revelation really

[3188.94 --> 3190.24]  standing
[3190.24 --> 3190.76]  open
[3190.76 --> 3191.64]  in heaven
[3191.64 --> 3193.02]  and the
[3193.02 --> 3193.60]  voice i
[3193.60 --> 3193.98]  heard

[3195.76 --> 3196.00]  me
[3196.00 --> 3196.44]  like a
[3196.44 --> 3196.70]  trumpet

[3205.30 --> 3205.96]  before me
[3205.96 --> 3206.38]  was a
[3206.38 --> 3206.80]  throne
[3206.80 --> 3207.30]  in heaven
[3207.30 --> 3207.90]  with someone

[3225.08 --> 3226.06]  elders
[3226.06 --> 3227.22]  and they
[3227.22 --> 3227.74]  were dressed

[3230.22 --> 3231.30]  and from
[3231.30 --> 3231.86]  the throne
[3231.86 --> 3232.64]  came flashes
[3232.64 --> 3233.34]  of lightning
[3233.34 --> 3234.18]  rumblings
[3234.18 --> 3234.86]  and peals

[3236.94 --> 3237.98]  seven lamps

[3239.54 --> 3240.12]  are the seven
[3240.12 --> 3241.16]  spirits of god

[3243.72 --> 3244.16]  what looked
[3244.16 --> 3245.12]  like a sea
[3245.12 --> 3246.12]  of glass
[3246.12 --> 3247.58]  clear as
[3247.58 --> 3248.02]  crystal

[3259.22 --> 3260.00]  the second
[3260.00 --> 3261.04]  was like an ox
[3261.04 --> 3261.72]  and the third
[3261.72 --> 3262.42]  had the face
[3262.42 --> 3263.52]  like a man
[3263.52 --> 3264.18]  and the fourth
[3264.18 --> 3264.74]  was like a
[3264.74 --> 3265.50]  flying eagle
[3265.50 --> 3267.10]  and each
[3267.10 --> 3267.64]  of the four
[3267.64 --> 3268.28]  living creatures
[3268.28 --> 3269.28]  had six wings
[3269.28 --> 3270.02]  and was covered
[3270.02 --> 3270.62]  with eyes
[3270.62 --> 3271.42]  all around
[3271.42 --> 3272.44]  even under

[3273.20 --> 3275.12]  day and night
[3275.12 --> 3275.62]  they never
[3275.62 --> 3276.48]  stopped saying

[3444.68 --> 3445.74]  apocalyptic
[3445.74 --> 3446.62]  you think of
[3446.62 --> 3447.58]  apocalypse now
[3447.58 --> 3448.54]  and your mind
[3448.54 --> 3449.02]  goes somewhere
[3449.02 --> 3449.66]  else that's not
[3449.66 --> 3449.88]  what we're
[3449.88 --> 3450.44]  talking about
[3450.44 --> 3452.56]  but when we
[3452.56 --> 3453.44]  hear apocalyptic
[3453.44 --> 3454.36]  maybe you do
[3454.36 --> 3454.78]  think about
[3454.78 --> 3455.28]  destruction
[3455.28 --> 3456.36]  right or the
[3456.36 --> 3457.38]  end times
[3457.38 --> 3457.82]  kind of
[3457.82 --> 3458.62]  cataclysm
[3458.62 --> 3459.04]  we think of
[3459.04 --> 3459.38]  the end of
[3459.38 --> 3459.80]  the world
[3459.80 --> 3461.52]  and in the
[3461.52 --> 3462.36]  modern history
[3462.36 --> 3462.76]  of the
[3462.76 --> 3463.26]  christian
[3463.26 --> 3463.62]  church
[3463.62 --> 3464.84]  we've kind
[3464.84 --> 3465.18]  of just
[3465.18 --> 3465.72]  begun to
[3465.72 --> 3466.56]  assume that
[3466.56 --> 3467.04]  meaning
[3467.04 --> 3468.20]  for ourselves
[3468.20 --> 3470.54]  but that's
[3470.54 --> 3471.24]  not what
[3471.24 --> 3471.92]  at least
[3471.92 --> 3472.46]  that's not
[3472.46 --> 3472.98]  all
[3472.98 --> 3474.20]  what the
[3474.20 --> 3474.50]  bible
[3474.50 --> 3475.16]  means
[3475.16 --> 3475.82]  when it
[3475.82 --> 3476.94]  uses
[3476.94 --> 3477.54]  when the
[3477.54 --> 3478.16]  authors who
[3478.16 --> 3478.74]  wrote the
[3478.74 --> 3479.52]  bible use
[3479.52 --> 3480.58]  apocalyptic
[3480.58 --> 3481.56]  stylings
[3481.56 --> 3482.12]  or write
[3482.12 --> 3482.64]  in this
[3482.64 --> 3483.30]  way
[3483.30 --> 3485.54]  in many
[3485.54 --> 3485.86]  ways
[3485.86 --> 3486.50]  what the
[3486.50 --> 3487.80]  apocalyptic
[3487.80 --> 3488.58]  literature
[3488.58 --> 3489.16]  is
[3489.16 --> 3490.04]  translates
[3490.04 --> 3490.64]  from greek
[3490.64 --> 3491.02]  to the
[3491.02 --> 3491.20]  word
[3491.20 --> 3491.76]  revelation
[3491.76 --> 3492.52]  which is
[3492.52 --> 3492.88]  where that
[3492.88 --> 3493.40]  title comes
[3493.40 --> 3493.62]  from
[3493.62 --> 3495.04]  is a
[3495.04 --> 3495.60]  lens
[3495.60 --> 3496.02]  or a
[3496.02 --> 3496.26]  means
[3496.26 --> 3496.66]  by which
[3496.66 --> 3497.64]  to see
[3497.64 --> 3500.16]  what is
[3500.16 --> 3500.92]  and what
[3500.92 --> 3501.70]  isn't
[3501.70 --> 3502.30]  or to put
[3502.30 --> 3502.66]  it another
[3502.66 --> 3502.98]  way
[3502.98 --> 3503.94]  we've gotten
[3503.94 --> 3504.48]  so used
[3504.48 --> 3505.08]  to seeing
[3505.08 --> 3505.76]  things
[3505.76 --> 3506.88]  and certain
[3506.88 --> 3507.40]  things
[3507.40 --> 3507.70]  that we
[3507.70 --> 3508.24]  don't see
[3508.24 --> 3508.60]  them
[3508.60 --> 3509.36]  anymore
[3509.36 --> 3510.30]  right
[3510.30 --> 3511.54]  we've got
[3511.54 --> 3511.96]  so used
[3511.96 --> 3512.46]  to doing
[3512.46 --> 3512.88]  certain
[3512.88 --> 3513.28]  things
[3513.28 --> 3513.52]  that we
[3513.52 --> 3513.96]  don't think
[3513.96 --> 3514.46]  about doing
[3514.46 --> 3514.80]  them
[3514.80 --> 3515.38]  anymore
[3515.38 --> 3515.84]  we just
[3515.84 --> 3516.38]  do them
[3516.38 --> 3516.64]  this is
[3516.64 --> 3516.92]  just the
[3516.92 --> 3517.32]  way life
[3517.32 --> 3517.68]  is
[3517.68 --> 3518.28]  this is
[3518.28 --> 3519.14]  the way
[3519.14 --> 3519.92]  everything
[3519.92 --> 3520.90]  is
[3520.90 --> 3523.20]  we don't
[3523.20 --> 3523.58]  see
[3523.58 --> 3524.44]  not because
[3524.44 --> 3524.80]  we don't
[3524.80 --> 3525.26]  look
[3525.26 --> 3526.14]  right
[3526.14 --> 3527.38]  we don't
[3527.38 --> 3527.72]  see
[3527.72 --> 3528.22]  even when
[3528.22 --> 3528.54]  we're
[3528.54 --> 3528.78]  looking
[3528.78 --> 3529.36]  right at
[3529.36 --> 3529.54]  it
[3529.54 --> 3529.88]  because
[3529.88 --> 3530.46]  there's
[3530.46 --> 3530.64]  just
[3530.64 --> 3531.02]  nothing
[3531.02 --> 3532.34]  to see
[3532.34 --> 3533.38]  because
[3533.38 --> 3533.58]  it's
[3533.58 --> 3533.82]  already
[3533.82 --> 3534.30]  everything
[3534.30 --> 3534.66]  it's
[3534.66 --> 3535.04]  it's
[3535.04 --> 3535.28]  already
[3535.28 --> 3535.76]  everywhere
[3535.76 --> 3536.84]  I've
[3536.84 --> 3537.64]  used this
[3537.64 --> 3538.04]  illustration
[3538.04 --> 3538.78]  before
[3538.78 --> 3539.42]  in other
[3539.42 --> 3539.90]  contexts
[3539.90 --> 3540.18]  and so
[3540.18 --> 3540.42]  if you've
[3540.42 --> 3540.64]  heard it
[3540.64 --> 3540.90]  from me
[3540.90 --> 3541.32]  take it
[3541.32 --> 3541.54]  as a
[3541.54 --> 3541.84]  reminder
[3541.84 --> 3542.18]  but it
[3542.18 --> 3542.40]  comes
[3542.40 --> 3542.68]  from
[3542.68 --> 3544.18]  David
[3544.18 --> 3544.70]  Foster
[3544.70 --> 3545.08]  Wallace
[3545.08 --> 3546.74]  and he
[3546.74 --> 3547.04]  talks
[3547.04 --> 3547.38]  about
[3547.38 --> 3547.94]  two
[3547.94 --> 3548.54]  young
[3548.54 --> 3549.02]  fish
[3549.02 --> 3549.30]  who
[3549.30 --> 3549.50]  are
[3549.50 --> 3550.04]  swimming
[3550.04 --> 3550.60]  along
[3550.60 --> 3551.10]  together
[3551.10 --> 3551.82]  beside
[3551.82 --> 3552.08]  each
[3552.08 --> 3552.34]  other
[3552.34 --> 3553.16]  and they
[3553.16 --> 3553.42]  meet
[3553.42 --> 3553.92]  an older
[3553.92 --> 3554.30]  fish
[3554.30 --> 3554.66]  who is
[3554.66 --> 3554.90]  swimming
[3554.90 --> 3555.44]  towards
[3555.44 --> 3555.74]  them
[3555.74 --> 3556.30]  and the
[3556.30 --> 3556.60]  older
[3556.60 --> 3556.94]  fish
[3556.94 --> 3557.38]  nods
[3557.38 --> 3557.60]  at the
[3557.60 --> 3557.76]  two
[3557.76 --> 3558.00]  little
[3558.00 --> 3558.32]  fish
[3558.32 --> 3558.58]  and he
[3558.58 --> 3558.78]  says
[3558.78 --> 3559.30]  morning
[3559.30 --> 3559.68]  boys
[3559.68 --> 3560.02]  how's
[3560.02 --> 3560.16]  the
[3560.16 --> 3560.48]  water
[3560.48 --> 3562.10]  and like
[3562.10 --> 3562.60]  you know
[3562.60 --> 3562.98]  youth
[3562.98 --> 3563.46]  looking at
[3563.46 --> 3563.70]  an old
[3563.70 --> 3564.00]  person
[3564.00 --> 3564.28]  or want
[3564.28 --> 3564.54]  to do
[3564.54 --> 3564.88]  they kind
[3564.88 --> 3565.06]  of go
[3565.06 --> 3565.48]  hmm
[3565.48 --> 3566.24]  and they
[3566.24 --> 3566.56]  just sort
[3566.56 --> 3566.88]  of swim
[3566.88 --> 3567.24]  away
[3567.24 --> 3567.96]  eventually
[3567.96 --> 3568.32]  one of
[3568.32 --> 3568.42]  them
[3568.42 --> 3568.72]  turns
[3568.72 --> 3569.06]  to the
[3569.06 --> 3569.24]  other
[3569.24 --> 3569.52]  and he
[3569.52 --> 3570.04]  says
[3570.04 --> 3570.30]  to the
[3570.30 --> 3570.42]  other
[3570.42 --> 3570.60]  young
[3570.60 --> 3570.82]  fish
[3570.82 --> 3570.92]  he
[3570.92 --> 3571.08]  goes
[3575.08 --> 3575.64]  point
[3575.64 --> 3576.06]  is
[3576.06 --> 3576.94]  they
[3576.94 --> 3577.26]  swim
[3577.26 --> 3577.46]  in
[3577.46 --> 3577.68]  it
[3577.68 --> 3578.30]  so
[3578.30 --> 3578.40]  they
[3578.40 --> 3578.52]  don't
[3578.52 --> 3578.70]  know
[3578.70 --> 3578.92]  it
[3578.92 --> 3579.80]  that
[3579.80 --> 3580.02]  just
[3580.02 --> 3580.50]  is
[3580.50 --> 3581.44]  reality
[3581.44 --> 3582.46]  right
[3582.46 --> 3582.92]  we
[3582.92 --> 3583.26]  need
[3583.26 --> 3583.46]  to
[3583.46 --> 3583.84]  become
[3583.84 --> 3584.36]  aware
[3584.36 --> 3584.62]  of
[3584.62 --> 3584.78]  the
[3584.78 --> 3585.16]  water
[3585.16 --> 3586.18]  right
[3586.18 --> 3586.32]  the
[3586.32 --> 3586.56]  things
[3586.56 --> 3586.68]  that
[3586.68 --> 3586.78]  we
[3586.78 --> 3586.92]  are
[3586.92 --> 3587.26]  blind
[3587.26 --> 3587.64]  to
[3587.64 --> 3588.60]  precisely
[3588.60 --> 3589.50]  because
[3589.50 --> 3589.80]  they're
[3589.80 --> 3590.08]  just
[3590.08 --> 3590.60]  everywhere
[3590.60 --> 3590.94]  because
[3590.94 --> 3591.18]  it's
[3591.18 --> 3591.42]  just
[3591.42 --> 3591.82]  the
[3591.82 --> 3591.94]  way
[3591.94 --> 3592.06]  it
[3592.06 --> 3592.28]  is
[3592.28 --> 3592.52]  we
[3592.52 --> 3592.70]  need
[3592.70 --> 3592.84]  to
[3592.84 --> 3593.30]  see
[3593.30 --> 3593.96]  the
[3593.96 --> 3594.30]  water
[3594.30 --> 3594.50]  and
[3594.50 --> 3594.60]  we
[3594.60 --> 3594.72]  need
[3594.72 --> 3594.86]  to
[3594.86 --> 3595.16]  see
[3595.16 --> 3595.38]  how
[3595.38 --> 3595.56]  we've
[3595.56 --> 3595.70]  been
[3595.70 --> 3596.00]  swimming
[3596.00 --> 3596.18]  in
[3596.18 --> 3596.28]  it
[3596.28 --> 3596.42]  in
[3596.42 --> 3596.56]  our
[3596.56 --> 3597.22]  entire
[3597.22 --> 3598.10]  lives
[3598.10 --> 3598.62]  and
[3598.62 --> 3599.64]  apocalyptic
[3599.64 --> 3600.42]  literature
[3600.42 --> 3600.80]  like
[3600.80 --> 3600.96]  the

[3603.26 --> 3603.46]  you
[3603.46 --> 3603.86]  aware
[3603.86 --> 3604.38]  of
[3604.38 --> 3604.52]  the
[3604.52 --> 3604.82]  water
[3604.82 --> 3608.12]  what
[3608.12 --> 3608.34]  I'm
[3608.34 --> 3609.00]  talking
[3609.00 --> 3609.26]  about

[3616.02 --> 3616.82]  picks up
[3616.82 --> 3617.02]  this
[3617.02 --> 3617.32]  point
[3617.32 --> 3617.56]  and he

[3778.94 --> 3779.42]  slightly
[3779.42 --> 3779.68]  to
[3779.68 --> 3779.96]  cover
[3779.96 --> 3780.16]  what
[3780.16 --> 3780.28]  they
[3780.28 --> 3780.52]  want
[3780.52 --> 3780.68]  to
[3780.68 --> 3781.00]  hide
[3781.00 --> 3781.44]  and
[3781.44 --> 3781.56]  they
[3781.56 --> 3781.80]  paint
[3781.80 --> 3781.96]  a

[3783.10 --> 3783.40]  screen
[3783.40 --> 3783.66]  one
[3783.66 --> 3783.86]  that
[3783.86 --> 3784.56]  captivates
[3784.56 --> 3784.74]  and
[3784.74 --> 3785.52]  mesmerizes
[3785.52 --> 3786.02]  and
[3786.02 --> 3786.58]  inspires
[3786.58 --> 3787.12]  and
[3787.12 --> 3787.22]  if
[3787.22 --> 3787.34]  you
[3787.34 --> 3787.50]  look

[3788.90 --> 3789.62]  you're
[3789.62 --> 3790.06]  dazzled
[3790.06 --> 3790.26]  by
[3790.26 --> 3790.52]  what's
[3790.52 --> 3790.84]  presented

[3793.22 --> 3793.60]  is
[3793.60 --> 3794.64]  revealing
[3794.64 --> 3795.64]  precisely
[3795.64 --> 3796.10]  because
[3796.10 --> 3796.28]  it
[3796.28 --> 3796.46]  gives
[3796.46 --> 3796.60]  us
[3796.60 --> 3796.76]  a
[3796.76 --> 3797.06]  new
[3797.06 --> 3797.76]  perspective

[3805.12 --> 3805.64]  invites
[3805.64 --> 3805.92]  us
[3805.92 --> 3806.14]  to
[3806.14 --> 3806.84]  lean
[3806.84 --> 3807.40]  over
[3807.40 --> 3807.74]  and
[3807.74 --> 3807.92]  get
[3807.92 --> 3808.08]  a
[3808.08 --> 3808.30]  new

[3810.76 --> 3810.94]  to
[3810.94 --> 3811.16]  what's
[3811.16 --> 3811.54]  really
[3811.54 --> 3812.30]  behind
[3812.30 --> 3812.64]  the
[3812.64 --> 3812.96]  screen
[3812.96 --> 3815.58]  a
[3815.58 --> 3816.44]  few
[3816.44 --> 3816.68]  years
[3816.68 --> 3816.96]  ago
[3816.96 --> 3817.34]  my
[3817.34 --> 3818.16]  family
[3818.16 --> 3818.50]  and I
[3818.50 --> 3818.66]  we
[3818.66 --> 3818.76]  were
[3818.76 --> 3820.20]  traveling
[3820.20 --> 3820.48]  it was
[3820.48 --> 3820.72]  Easter
[3820.72 --> 3821.08]  Sunday
[3821.08 --> 3822.10]  and we
[3822.10 --> 3822.20]  were
[3822.20 --> 3822.32]  going
[3822.32 --> 3822.38]  to
[3822.38 --> 3822.50]  go
[3822.50 --> 3822.66]  for
[3822.66 --> 3822.80]  a
[3822.80 --> 3823.08]  hike
[3823.08 --> 3823.40]  in
[3823.40 --> 3823.52]  the
[3823.52 --> 3823.78]  Niagara
[3823.78 --> 3824.10]  area
[3824.10 --> 3824.30]  where
[3824.30 --> 3824.50]  we
[3824.50 --> 3824.82]  lived
[3824.82 --> 3824.92]  at
[3824.92 --> 3825.04]  the
[3825.04 --> 3825.26]  time
[3825.26 --> 3826.26]  and
[3826.26 --> 3826.40]  to
[3826.40 --> 3826.64]  get
[3826.64 --> 3827.12]  into
[3827.12 --> 3828.12]  the
[3828.12 --> 3828.44]  heart
[3828.44 --> 3828.86]  of
[3828.86 --> 3829.24]  Niagara
[3829.24 --> 3829.44]  on
[3829.44 --> 3829.54]  the
[3829.54 --> 3829.80]  lake
[3829.80 --> 3830.02]  from
[3830.02 --> 3830.18]  where
[3830.18 --> 3830.36]  we
[3830.36 --> 3830.68]  lived
[3830.68 --> 3830.90]  we
[3830.90 --> 3831.06]  had
[3831.06 --> 3831.20]  to
[3831.20 --> 3831.58]  drive
[3831.58 --> 3832.34]  past
[3832.34 --> 3833.06]  this
[3833.06 --> 3834.02]  massive
[3834.02 --> 3834.52]  outlet
[3834.52 --> 3834.90]  mall
[3834.90 --> 3836.42]  and
[3836.42 --> 3836.60]  as
[3836.60 --> 3836.74]  we
[3836.74 --> 3836.92]  drove
[3836.92 --> 3837.30]  past
[3837.30 --> 3837.48]  on
[3837.48 --> 3837.76]  Easter
[3837.76 --> 3838.18]  Sunday
[3838.18 --> 3839.26]  it
[3839.26 --> 3839.48]  was
[3839.48 --> 3839.70]  like
[3839.70 --> 3840.30]  street
[3840.30 --> 3840.90]  only
[3840.90 --> 3841.40]  parking
[3841.40 --> 3842.50]  it
[3842.50 --> 3842.70]  was
[3842.70 --> 3843.56]  packed
[3843.56 --> 3845.32]  Rachel
[3845.32 --> 3845.64]  leaned
[3845.64 --> 3845.92]  over
[3845.92 --> 3846.30]  as we
[3846.30 --> 3846.48]  drove
[3846.48 --> 3846.74]  by
[3846.74 --> 3846.92]  and
[3846.92 --> 3847.08]  she
[3847.08 --> 3847.38]  goes
[3847.38 --> 3848.12]  I
[3848.12 --> 3848.30]  guess
[3848.30 --> 3848.50]  that
[3848.50 --> 3848.82]  temple
[3848.82 --> 3848.94]  is
[3848.94 --> 3849.22]  open
[3849.22 --> 3849.42]  for
[3849.42 --> 3849.70]  worship
[3849.70 --> 3850.00]  today
[3850.00 --> 3850.28]  too
[3850.28 --> 3852.46]  and
[3852.46 --> 3852.58]  I
[3852.58 --> 3853.08]  laughed
[3853.08 --> 3853.40]  because
[3853.40 --> 3853.64]  that
[3853.64 --> 3853.84]  just
[3853.84 --> 3854.14]  shows
[3854.14 --> 3854.28]  how
[3854.28 --> 3854.40]  many
[3854.40 --> 3854.68]  times
[3854.68 --> 3855.02]  we have
[3855.02 --> 3855.18]  these
[3855.18 --> 3855.40]  kinds
[3855.40 --> 3855.52]  of
[3855.52 --> 3855.98]  conversations
[3855.98 --> 3856.38]  in my
[3856.38 --> 3856.64]  house
[3856.64 --> 3857.14]  we're
[3857.14 --> 3857.38]  a really
[3857.38 --> 3857.78]  exciting
[3857.78 --> 3858.14]  bunch
[3858.14 --> 3861.92]  but she
[3861.92 --> 3862.36]  was pointing
[3862.36 --> 3862.72]  to the
[3862.72 --> 3863.20]  fact that
[3863.20 --> 3863.76]  the mall
[3863.76 --> 3864.92]  is a place
[3864.92 --> 3865.96]  of formation
[3865.96 --> 3867.36]  right the mall
[3867.36 --> 3869.16]  modern consumerism
[3869.16 --> 3870.04]  is the water
[3870.04 --> 3870.44]  that we
[3870.44 --> 3871.40]  swim in
[3871.40 --> 3871.96]  right and
[3871.96 --> 3872.32]  the mall
[3872.32 --> 3872.70]  is a
[3872.70 --> 3873.02]  temple
[3873.02 --> 3873.66]  it's not
[3873.66 --> 3874.12]  just some
[3874.12 --> 3874.70]  neutral
[3874.70 --> 3875.34]  space
[3875.34 --> 3876.50]  and not
[3876.50 --> 3876.86]  because it
[3876.86 --> 3877.14]  has a
[3877.14 --> 3877.60]  theology
[3877.60 --> 3878.14]  per se
[3878.14 --> 3878.74]  even though
[3878.74 --> 3879.08]  it does
[3879.08 --> 3879.72]  but it's
[3879.72 --> 3880.06]  not a
[3880.06 --> 3880.24]  neutral
[3880.24 --> 3880.62]  space
[3880.62 --> 3881.02]  because it
[3881.02 --> 3881.24]  wants
[3881.24 --> 3881.44]  your
[3881.44 --> 3881.98]  heart
[3881.98 --> 3883.08]  it
[3883.08 --> 3883.32]  wants
[3883.32 --> 3883.50]  your
[3883.50 --> 3884.04]  love
[3884.04 --> 3884.22]  it
[3884.22 --> 3884.42]  wants
[3884.42 --> 3884.64]  your
[3884.64 --> 3885.78]  affections
[3885.78 --> 3886.48]  and
[3886.48 --> 3886.80]  then it
[3886.80 --> 3887.36]  shapes
[3887.36 --> 3887.86]  you
[3887.86 --> 3888.34]  with
[3888.34 --> 3888.86]  intentional
[3888.86 --> 3889.62]  designs
[3889.62 --> 3890.12]  and
[3890.12 --> 3890.78]  practices
[3890.78 --> 3891.28]  and
[3891.28 --> 3891.92]  structures
[3891.92 --> 3892.70]  and
[3892.70 --> 3893.30]  movements
[3893.30 --> 3893.96]  and the
[3893.96 --> 3894.30]  mall is
[3894.30 --> 3894.52]  one
[3894.52 --> 3894.94]  example
[3894.94 --> 3895.40]  of this
[3895.40 --> 3895.72]  there's
[3895.72 --> 3896.26]  countless
[3896.26 --> 3896.68]  others
[3896.68 --> 3897.36]  in our
[3897.36 --> 3897.68]  culture
[3897.68 --> 3898.50]  it's a
[3898.50 --> 3898.88]  movement
[3898.88 --> 3899.48]  of a
[3899.48 --> 3899.94]  liturgy
[3899.94 --> 3900.18]  of
[3900.18 --> 3900.70]  behaviors
[3900.70 --> 3901.00]  and
[3901.00 --> 3901.42]  commitments
[3901.42 --> 3901.84]  that we
[3901.84 --> 3902.20]  are
[3902.20 --> 3902.62]  shaped
[3902.62 --> 3902.92]  by
[3902.92 --> 3903.26]  as we
[3903.26 --> 3903.68]  process
[3903.68 --> 3903.98]  them
[3903.98 --> 3904.16]  and
[3904.16 --> 3904.72]  engage
[3904.72 --> 3904.98]  in them
[3904.98 --> 3905.26]  over
[3905.26 --> 3905.92]  and over
[3905.92 --> 3906.46]  and over
[3906.46 --> 3907.58]  but with
[3907.58 --> 3908.22]  eyes to
[3908.22 --> 3908.66]  see
[3908.66 --> 3910.22]  we can
[3910.22 --> 3910.60]  say
[3910.60 --> 3911.32]  that temple
[3911.32 --> 3911.78]  is open
[3911.78 --> 3912.00]  too
[3912.00 --> 3914.44]  and so
[3914.44 --> 3914.88]  with those
[3914.88 --> 3915.32]  eyes
[3915.32 --> 3915.84]  we come
[3915.84 --> 3916.38]  fresh
[3916.38 --> 3916.92]  to just
[3916.92 --> 3917.24]  what is
[3917.24 --> 3917.60]  happening
[3917.60 --> 3918.02]  around
[3918.02 --> 3918.30]  us
[3918.30 --> 3919.08]  to what
[3919.08 --> 3919.42]  is
[3919.42 --> 3920.00]  shaping
[3920.00 --> 3920.50]  us
[3920.50 --> 3920.84]  in the
[3920.84 --> 3921.14]  world
[3921.14 --> 3922.54]  and so
[3922.54 --> 3922.82]  we are
[3922.82 --> 3923.54]  looking
[3923.54 --> 3924.10]  a little
[3924.10 --> 3924.74]  left
[3924.74 --> 3925.54]  or
[3925.54 --> 3925.86]  right
[3925.86 --> 3926.20]  if
[3926.20 --> 3926.46]  looking
[3926.46 --> 3926.74]  left
[3926.74 --> 3927.06]  bothers
[3927.06 --> 3927.24]  you
[3927.24 --> 3927.40]  for
[3927.40 --> 3927.96]  political
[3927.96 --> 3928.40]  reasons
[3928.40 --> 3930.62]  to see
[3930.62 --> 3930.92]  what's
[3930.92 --> 3931.16]  really
[3931.16 --> 3931.42]  going
[3931.42 --> 3931.80]  on
[3931.80 --> 3933.38]  now
[3933.38 --> 3933.54]  you've
[3933.54 --> 3933.68]  already
[3933.68 --> 3934.06]  heard me
[3934.06 --> 3934.30]  say
[3934.30 --> 3934.50]  that
[3934.50 --> 3934.74]  the
[3934.74 --> 3935.30]  ascension
[3935.30 --> 3935.98]  of
[3935.98 --> 3936.32]  Jesus
[3936.32 --> 3936.76]  has
[3936.76 --> 3937.00]  given
[3937.00 --> 3937.26]  us
[3937.26 --> 3937.76]  heaven
[3937.76 --> 3938.36]  attained
[3938.36 --> 3939.24]  right
[3939.24 --> 3939.42]  not
[3939.42 --> 3939.66]  just
[3939.66 --> 3940.06]  hope
[3940.06 --> 3940.44]  for
[3940.44 --> 3941.04]  but
[3941.04 --> 3941.72]  a
[3941.72 --> 3942.32]  constant
[3942.32 --> 3942.94]  advocate
[3942.94 --> 3943.22]  and
[3943.22 --> 3943.86]  intercessor
[3943.86 --> 3944.36]  right
[3944.36 --> 3944.90]  and by
[3944.90 --> 3945.10]  that
[3945.10 --> 3945.26]  a
[3945.26 --> 3945.62]  gracious
[3945.62 --> 3946.16]  gifting
[3946.16 --> 3946.60]  of the
[3946.60 --> 3946.82]  Holy
[3946.82 --> 3947.20]  Spirit
[3947.20 --> 3947.74]  you've
[3947.74 --> 3948.04]  already
[3948.04 --> 3948.50]  heard me
[3948.50 --> 3948.74]  say
[3948.74 --> 3948.98]  that
[3948.98 --> 3949.80]  worship
[3949.80 --> 3950.60]  here
[3950.60 --> 3951.46]  reminds
[3951.46 --> 3951.72]  us
[3951.72 --> 3951.94]  of
[3951.94 --> 3952.30]  that
[3952.30 --> 3953.80]  now
[3953.80 --> 3954.76]  I want
[3954.76 --> 3954.96]  to be
[3954.96 --> 3955.24]  clear
[3955.24 --> 3955.66]  again
[3955.66 --> 3956.20]  one more
[3956.20 --> 3956.50]  time
[3956.50 --> 3957.58]  because
[3957.58 --> 3957.84]  some
[3957.84 --> 3958.12]  of you
[3958.12 --> 3958.64]  are
[3958.64 --> 3958.86]  pretty
[3958.86 --> 3959.08]  good
[3959.08 --> 3959.56]  reformed
[3959.56 --> 3960.12]  theologians
[3960.12 --> 3960.64]  and you've
[3960.64 --> 3960.88]  already
[3960.88 --> 3961.84]  made a
[3961.84 --> 3962.18]  distinction
[3962.18 --> 3962.56]  in your
[3962.56 --> 3962.84]  mind
[3962.84 --> 3963.16]  between
[3963.16 --> 3963.68]  worship
[3963.68 --> 3964.54]  here
[3964.54 --> 3964.96]  present
[3964.96 --> 3965.38]  and then
[3965.38 --> 3965.76]  worship
[3965.76 --> 3966.10]  like
[3966.10 --> 3967.04]  out there
[3967.04 --> 3967.38]  the way
[3967.38 --> 3967.82]  we live
[3967.82 --> 3968.40]  our lives
[3968.40 --> 3968.60]  right
[3968.60 --> 3969.06]  sometimes
[3969.06 --> 3969.50]  we say
[3969.50 --> 3969.90]  that all
[3969.90 --> 3970.32]  of life
[3970.32 --> 3970.84]  is lived
[3970.84 --> 3971.38]  corum
[3971.38 --> 3971.88]  deo
[3971.88 --> 3972.48]  which is
[3972.48 --> 3972.78]  latin
[3972.78 --> 3973.34]  for before
[3973.34 --> 3973.84]  the face
[3973.84 --> 3974.38]  of god
[3974.38 --> 3974.90]  right
[3974.90 --> 3975.16]  that our
[3975.16 --> 3975.52]  work
[3975.52 --> 3975.98]  becomes
[3975.98 --> 3976.42]  a way
[3976.42 --> 3976.72]  of
[3976.72 --> 3977.40]  worship
[3977.40 --> 3977.82]  we talk
[3977.82 --> 3978.00]  about
[3978.00 --> 3978.80]  every square
[3978.80 --> 3979.16]  inch
[3979.16 --> 3979.68]  or all
[3979.68 --> 3980.16]  of life
[3980.16 --> 3980.60]  worship
[3980.60 --> 3981.26]  and all
[3981.26 --> 3981.54]  that is
[3981.54 --> 3982.04]  good
[3982.04 --> 3982.44]  right
[3982.44 --> 3982.70]  and all
[3982.70 --> 3983.00]  that is
[3983.00 --> 3983.44]  one of
[3983.44 --> 3983.96]  the strong
[3983.96 --> 3984.86]  attributes
[3984.86 --> 3985.18]  of
[3985.18 --> 3985.68]  reformed
[3985.68 --> 3986.02]  theology
[3986.02 --> 3986.48]  to the
[3986.48 --> 3986.72]  broader
[3986.72 --> 3987.08]  world
[3987.08 --> 3987.22]  of
[3987.22 --> 3987.50]  public
[3987.50 --> 3987.96]  theology
[3987.96 --> 3989.50]  but
[3989.50 --> 3990.62]  what I'm
[3990.62 --> 3991.06]  talking about
[3991.06 --> 3991.36]  here
[3991.36 --> 3991.56]  and what
[3991.56 --> 3991.98]  our focus
[3991.98 --> 3992.32]  here
[3992.32 --> 3992.94]  is
[3992.94 --> 3994.36]  gathered
[3994.36 --> 3995.42]  worship
[3995.42 --> 3996.24]  and so
[3996.24 --> 3996.58]  maybe that's
[3996.58 --> 3996.84]  a helpful
[3996.84 --> 3997.26]  distinction
[3997.26 --> 3997.56]  between
[3997.56 --> 3998.24]  gathered
[3998.24 --> 3998.82]  worship
[3998.82 --> 3999.10]  where we
[3999.10 --> 3999.26]  come
[3999.26 --> 3999.52]  together
[3999.52 --> 3999.96]  and
[3999.96 --> 4000.62]  scattered
[4000.62 --> 4001.74]  worship
[4001.74 --> 4002.28]  where we
[4002.28 --> 4002.48]  go
[4002.48 --> 4004.00]  gathered
[4004.00 --> 4004.42]  worship
[4004.42 --> 4004.88]  is what
[4004.88 --> 4005.18]  we are
[4005.18 --> 4005.50]  doing
[4005.50 --> 4006.38]  right now
[4006.38 --> 4006.74]  what we
[4006.74 --> 4007.10]  do on
[4007.10 --> 4007.74]  Sunday
[4007.74 --> 4008.14]  morning
[4008.14 --> 4008.80]  or Sunday
[4008.80 --> 4009.16]  evening
[4009.16 --> 4009.60]  in some
[4009.60 --> 4009.98]  places
[4009.98 --> 4010.58]  sometimes
[4010.58 --> 4011.40]  on
[4011.40 --> 4012.10]  Saturdays
[4012.10 --> 4012.28]  or
[4012.28 --> 4013.00]  Wednesdays
[4013.00 --> 4013.64]  the day
[4013.64 --> 4014.34]  isn't so
[4014.34 --> 4014.92]  important
[4014.92 --> 4015.58]  although there's
[4015.58 --> 4016.44]  part of that
[4016.44 --> 4016.84]  in play
[4016.84 --> 4017.16]  here
[4017.16 --> 4019.10]  as it is
[4019.10 --> 4019.56]  the fact
[4019.56 --> 4020.30]  that believers
[4020.30 --> 4021.42]  are gathering
[4021.42 --> 4022.20]  together
[4022.20 --> 4023.38]  and searching
[4023.38 --> 4024.52]  and longing
[4024.52 --> 4025.48]  to encounter
[4025.48 --> 4026.16]  the living
[4026.16 --> 4026.74]  God
[4026.74 --> 4027.84]  through his
[4027.84 --> 4028.74]  living word
[4028.74 --> 4029.68]  and song
[4029.68 --> 4030.34]  and liturgy
[4030.34 --> 4030.94]  and bible
[4030.94 --> 4032.06]  and sermon
[4032.06 --> 4033.00]  and sacrament
[4033.00 --> 4033.80]  together
[4033.80 --> 4034.54]  through praying
[4034.54 --> 4035.10]  offered
[4035.10 --> 4036.20]  and offering
[4036.20 --> 4037.02]  given
[4037.02 --> 4037.90]  through testimony
[4037.90 --> 4039.18]  and reflection
[4039.18 --> 4040.80]  scattered
[4040.80 --> 4041.22]  worship
[4041.22 --> 4041.60]  is what
[4041.60 --> 4041.86]  you do
[4041.86 --> 4042.14]  when you
[4042.14 --> 4042.46]  leave
[4042.46 --> 4043.62]  at every
[4043.62 --> 4043.94]  moment
[4043.94 --> 4044.34]  of every
[4044.34 --> 4044.82]  other day
[4044.82 --> 4045.74]  is also
[4045.74 --> 4046.28]  worship
[4046.28 --> 4046.84]  either of
[4046.84 --> 4047.26]  God
[4047.26 --> 4048.16]  or if
[4048.16 --> 4048.60]  you're in
[4048.60 --> 4049.00]  the water
[4049.00 --> 4049.60]  of something
[4049.60 --> 4050.02]  else
[4050.02 --> 4050.54]  but it is
[4050.54 --> 4051.18]  worship
[4051.18 --> 4051.62]  right the way
[4051.62 --> 4052.02]  you work
[4052.02 --> 4052.68]  is worship
[4052.68 --> 4053.38]  your parenting
[4053.38 --> 4054.14]  is a form
[4054.14 --> 4054.96]  of worship
[4054.96 --> 4055.60]  your play
[4055.60 --> 4056.52]  is a form
[4056.52 --> 4057.08]  of worship
[4057.08 --> 4057.76]  your art
[4057.76 --> 4058.74]  is a form
[4058.74 --> 4059.32]  of worship
[4059.32 --> 4059.84]  obeying
[4059.84 --> 4060.56]  your parents
[4060.56 --> 4061.48]  is a form
[4061.48 --> 4062.12]  of worship
[4062.12 --> 4064.06]  school
[4064.06 --> 4064.82]  right
[4064.82 --> 4065.28]  all of
[4065.28 --> 4065.46]  these
[4065.46 --> 4065.90]  things
[4065.90 --> 4067.22]  we gather
[4067.22 --> 4068.30]  for worship
[4068.30 --> 4068.94]  so that we
[4068.94 --> 4069.72]  can scatter
[4069.72 --> 4070.76]  and worship
[4070.76 --> 4071.32]  well
[4071.32 --> 4072.98]  this morning
[4072.98 --> 4073.92]  and in
[4073.92 --> 4074.48]  revelation
[4074.48 --> 4075.00]  here
[4075.00 --> 4075.40]  in these
[4075.40 --> 4077.30]  chapters 4
[4077.30 --> 4077.64]  and 5
[4077.64 --> 4078.22]  in particular
[4078.22 --> 4079.28]  I want to
[4079.28 --> 4079.60]  look at
[4079.60 --> 4080.28]  gathered
[4080.28 --> 4081.36]  worship
[4081.36 --> 4082.70]  that ordinary
[4082.70 --> 4084.20]  but not so
[4084.20 --> 4084.66]  ordinary
[4084.66 --> 4085.72]  regular
[4085.72 --> 4087.06]  weekly
[4087.06 --> 4087.92]  worship
[4087.92 --> 4089.12]  of the church
[4089.12 --> 4090.10]  whether that's
[4090.10 --> 4090.40]  here
[4090.40 --> 4091.36]  or in houses
[4091.36 --> 4092.46]  or in fields
[4092.46 --> 4093.46]  or around
[4093.46 --> 4093.92]  the world
[4093.92 --> 4094.66]  as the
[4094.66 --> 4095.02]  gathered
[4095.02 --> 4095.78]  church
[4095.78 --> 4096.64]  comes together
[4096.64 --> 4097.78]  and what I
[4097.78 --> 4098.34]  want to suggest
[4098.34 --> 4098.74]  to you
[4098.74 --> 4099.74]  what I believe
[4099.74 --> 4100.02]  the book
[4100.02 --> 4100.56]  of revelation
[4100.56 --> 4101.48]  is showing
[4101.48 --> 4102.12]  us as we
[4102.12 --> 4102.90]  tilt to look
[4102.90 --> 4103.24]  through the
[4103.24 --> 4103.94]  louvered blinds
[4103.94 --> 4104.34]  is that there
[4104.34 --> 4104.96]  is nothing
[4104.96 --> 4105.94]  ordinary
[4105.94 --> 4107.26]  about ordinary
[4107.26 --> 4108.26]  worship
[4108.26 --> 4109.68]  and so again
[4109.68 --> 4110.26]  with your bible
[4110.26 --> 4111.86]  in front of you
[4111.86 --> 4113.76]  John says
[4113.76 --> 4114.36]  after this
[4114.36 --> 4114.92]  I looked
[4114.92 --> 4115.38]  and there
[4115.38 --> 4115.98]  before me
[4115.98 --> 4116.66]  was a door
[4116.66 --> 4117.82]  standing open
[4117.82 --> 4119.12]  in heaven
[4119.12 --> 4121.46]  right
[4121.46 --> 4121.70]  some
[4121.70 --> 4122.54]  have it
[4122.54 --> 4123.24]  translated
[4123.24 --> 4123.72]  as an
[4123.72 --> 4124.70]  opened door
[4124.70 --> 4125.32]  or a door
[4125.32 --> 4126.06]  standing open
[4126.06 --> 4126.38]  but it was
[4126.38 --> 4127.32]  it was opened
[4127.32 --> 4128.38]  it was revealed
[4128.38 --> 4129.10]  God has
[4129.10 --> 4130.54]  opened to him
[4130.54 --> 4131.62]  the heavenly
[4131.62 --> 4132.52]  throne room
[4132.52 --> 4133.34]  and invited
[4133.34 --> 4134.24]  John in
[4134.24 --> 4134.84]  to see
[4134.84 --> 4135.48]  what's going
[4135.48 --> 4135.94]  on
[4135.94 --> 4136.88]  right
[4136.88 --> 4137.26]  this is
[4137.26 --> 4137.68]  John's
[4137.68 --> 4137.94]  leaning
[4137.94 --> 4138.44]  to the
[4138.44 --> 4139.20]  left
[4139.20 --> 4139.76]  to look
[4139.76 --> 4139.94]  through
[4139.94 --> 4140.40]  the louvered
[4140.40 --> 4140.88]  blinds
[4140.88 --> 4141.50]  and he's
[4141.50 --> 4141.76]  looking
[4141.76 --> 4142.28]  for the
[4142.28 --> 4142.64]  truth
[4142.64 --> 4143.20]  behind the
[4143.20 --> 4143.56]  picture
[4143.56 --> 4144.18]  and what
[4144.18 --> 4144.46]  he is
[4144.46 --> 4144.88]  given a
[4144.88 --> 4145.14]  vision
[4145.14 --> 4145.66]  of
[4145.66 --> 4147.02]  is heaven
[4147.02 --> 4148.68]  and this
[4148.68 --> 4149.10]  is important
[4149.10 --> 4150.22]  right
[4150.22 --> 4151.02]  where is
[4151.02 --> 4151.50]  John
[4151.50 --> 4152.12]  when this
[4152.12 --> 4152.56]  happens
[4152.56 --> 4156.78]  chapter 1
[4156.78 --> 4157.68]  flip back a
[4157.68 --> 4158.24]  couple pages
[4158.24 --> 4160.54]  verse 10
[4160.54 --> 4161.78]  chapter 1
[4161.78 --> 4162.32]  verse 10
[4162.32 --> 4163.44]  on the
[4163.44 --> 4164.36]  Lord's day
[4164.36 --> 4165.82]  I was in
[4165.82 --> 4166.38]  the spirit
[4166.38 --> 4167.42]  and I heard
[4167.42 --> 4167.92]  behind me
[4167.92 --> 4168.78]  a loud voice
[4168.78 --> 4169.30]  like a
[4169.30 --> 4169.62]  trumpet
[4169.62 --> 4171.14]  right
[4171.14 --> 4171.74]  on the
[4171.74 --> 4172.40]  Lord's day
[4172.40 --> 4173.12]  the Lord's
[4173.12 --> 4173.28]  day
[4173.28 --> 4173.60]  for those
[4173.60 --> 4173.78]  of you
[4173.78 --> 4174.10]  who don't
[4174.10 --> 4174.28]  know
[4174.28 --> 4174.74]  from the
[4174.74 --> 4175.04]  very
[4175.04 --> 4175.46]  beginning
[4175.46 --> 4176.12]  after Jesus
[4176.12 --> 4176.64]  resurrection
[4176.64 --> 4177.36]  is
[4177.36 --> 4178.34]  Sunday
[4178.34 --> 4179.50]  is the
[4179.50 --> 4179.80]  day
[4179.80 --> 4180.22]  that the
[4180.22 --> 4180.60]  church
[4180.60 --> 4181.50]  from the
[4181.50 --> 4181.92]  New Testament
[4181.92 --> 4182.28]  forward
[4182.28 --> 4183.02]  has gathered
[4183.02 --> 4183.78]  to worship
[4183.78 --> 4184.14]  God
[4184.14 --> 4185.44]  so John
[4185.44 --> 4186.36]  is in the
[4186.36 --> 4187.24]  gathering of

[4402.46 --> 4402.66]  it
[4402.66 --> 4403.28]  happens
[4403.28 --> 4404.06]  but
[4404.06 --> 4404.36]  now
[4404.36 --> 4404.62]  we
[4404.62 --> 4404.76]  are

[4412.90 --> 4413.14]  or
[4413.14 --> 4413.76]  dark

[4414.00 --> 4414.16]  may

[4415.04 --> 4415.22]  you
[4415.22 --> 4415.52]  sure
[4415.52 --> 4415.72]  it
[4415.72 --> 4415.86]  is
[4415.86 --> 4416.32]  real
[4416.32 --> 4416.74]  and
[4416.74 --> 4416.84]  it
[4416.84 --> 4417.02]  still
[4417.02 --> 4417.20]  has
[4417.20 --> 4417.78]  consequences
[4417.78 --> 4418.04]  for
[4418.04 --> 4418.20]  the

[4423.94 --> 4424.36]  real
[4424.36 --> 4424.60]  and
[4424.60 --> 4425.08]  perhaps
[4425.08 --> 4425.44]  it's
[4425.44 --> 4425.64]  even
[4425.64 --> 4425.84]  an

[4484.06 --> 4484.22]  and
[4484.22 --> 4484.38]  in
[4484.38 --> 4484.54]  front
[4484.54 --> 4484.64]  of
[4484.64 --> 4484.76]  the
[4484.76 --> 4485.02]  throne
[4485.02 --> 4485.18]  there
[4485.18 --> 4485.30]  was
[4485.30 --> 4485.42]  what
[4485.42 --> 4485.66]  looked
[4485.66 --> 4485.86]  like
[4485.86 --> 4486.00]  a
[4486.00 --> 4486.28]  sea
[4486.28 --> 4486.50]  of
[4486.50 --> 4486.94]  glass
[4486.94 --> 4487.62]  clear
[4487.62 --> 4488.10]  as
[4488.10 --> 4488.54]  crystal
[4488.54 --> 4490.42]  now
[4490.42 --> 4490.52]  I'm
[4490.52 --> 4490.68]  not
[4490.68 --> 4491.52]  really
[4491.52 --> 4491.90]  interested
[4491.90 --> 4492.32]  in
[4492.32 --> 4493.06]  parsing
[4493.06 --> 4493.28]  out
[4493.28 --> 4493.86]  exactly
[4493.86 --> 4494.14]  what
[4494.14 --> 4494.94]  image
[4494.94 --> 4495.20]  that
[4495.20 --> 4495.38]  might
[4495.38 --> 4495.64]  mean
[4495.64 --> 4495.78]  or
[4495.78 --> 4495.92]  what
[4495.92 --> 4496.04]  the
[4496.04 --> 4496.40]  numbers
[4496.40 --> 4496.96]  might
[4496.96 --> 4497.20]  be
[4497.20 --> 4497.38]  because
[4497.38 --> 4497.54]  I'm
[4497.54 --> 4497.68]  not
[4497.68 --> 4497.86]  sure
[4497.86 --> 4498.02]  that
[4498.02 --> 4498.26]  that's
[4498.26 --> 4498.82]  particularly
[4498.82 --> 4499.70]  relevant
[4499.70 --> 4500.04]  I don't
[4500.04 --> 4500.28]  know if
[4500.28 --> 4500.64]  that really
[4500.64 --> 4501.20]  matters
[4501.20 --> 4501.42]  what
[4501.42 --> 4502.16]  matters
[4502.16 --> 4502.36]  is
[4502.36 --> 4502.50]  the
[4502.50 --> 4503.26]  picture
[4503.26 --> 4503.94]  is
[4503.94 --> 4504.34]  the
[4504.34 --> 4504.94]  scope
[4504.94 --> 4505.38]  and
[4505.38 --> 4505.60]  the

[4506.06 --> 4506.54]  and

[4506.78 --> 4507.34]  mystery
[4507.34 --> 4507.86]  of
[4507.86 --> 4508.10]  what's
[4508.10 --> 4508.48]  presented
[4508.48 --> 4509.78]  I don't
[4509.78 --> 4509.88]  know
[4509.88 --> 4510.04]  about
[4510.04 --> 4510.20]  you
[4510.20 --> 4510.38]  but
[4510.38 --> 4510.74]  when
[4510.74 --> 4510.90]  I
[4510.90 --> 4511.22]  read
[4511.22 --> 4511.60]  this
[4511.60 --> 4512.80]  my

[4513.30 --> 4514.04]  is
[4514.04 --> 4515.06]  stirred
[4515.06 --> 4516.10]  and
[4516.10 --> 4516.22]  my

[4519.90 --> 4520.26]  there
[4520.26 --> 4520.86]  right
[4520.86 --> 4521.02]  because
[4521.02 --> 4521.16]  we're

[4537.34 --> 4537.74]  right
[4537.74 --> 4538.10]  words
[4538.10 --> 4538.46]  can't

[4541.68 --> 4542.46]  barely
[4542.46 --> 4542.82]  begin
[4542.82 --> 4543.02]  to
[4543.02 --> 4543.36]  comprehend
[4543.36 --> 4543.56]  it
[4543.56 --> 4543.72]  even
[4543.72 --> 4543.88]  as

[4544.04 --> 4544.56]  living
[4544.56 --> 4544.76]  in
[4544.76 --> 4544.92]  the

[4545.36 --> 4545.60]  of
[4545.60 --> 4545.70]  what
[4545.70 --> 4545.84]  is
[4545.84 --> 4546.16]  taking
[4546.16 --> 4546.76]  place
[4546.76 --> 4547.52]  here
[4547.52 --> 4548.72]  the
[4548.72 --> 4549.10]  more
[4549.10 --> 4549.24]  I
[4549.24 --> 4549.54]  think
[4549.54 --> 4549.88]  about
[4549.88 --> 4550.14]  it
[4550.14 --> 4550.70]  or

[4551.16 --> 4551.98]  see
[4551.98 --> 4552.18]  it
[4552.18 --> 4552.42]  and
[4552.42 --> 4552.98]  participate
[4552.98 --> 4553.38]  it
[4553.38 --> 4554.00]  it's
[4554.00 --> 4554.34]  less
[4554.34 --> 4555.18]  concrete
[4555.18 --> 4555.50]  and

[4564.02 --> 4564.14]  were
[4564.14 --> 4564.38]  covered
[4564.38 --> 4564.56]  with

[4579.34 --> 4580.22]  most

[4631.76 --> 4632.24]  stop
[4632.24 --> 4632.70]  saying
[4632.70 --> 4633.26]  holy
[4633.26 --> 4633.82]  holy
[4633.82 --> 4634.26]  holy
[4634.26 --> 4634.56]  is
[4634.56 --> 4634.72]  the
[4634.72 --> 4634.94]  Lord
[4634.94 --> 4635.26]  God
[4635.26 --> 4635.70]  almighty
[4635.70 --> 4635.94]  who
[4635.94 --> 4636.32]  was
[4636.32 --> 4636.52]  and
[4636.52 --> 4636.90]  is
[4636.90 --> 4637.42]  and
[4637.42 --> 4637.66]  is
[4637.66 --> 4637.84]  to
[4637.84 --> 4638.18]  come
[4638.18 --> 4638.80]  right
[4638.80 --> 4638.90]  they
[4638.90 --> 4639.04]  are
[4639.04 --> 4639.86]  always
[4639.86 --> 4640.74]  worshipping
[4640.74 --> 4641.10]  day
[4641.10 --> 4641.36]  and
[4641.36 --> 4641.64]  night
[4641.64 --> 4642.48]  and
[4642.48 --> 4642.62]  then
[4642.62 --> 4643.02]  notice
[4643.02 --> 4643.60]  right
[4643.60 --> 4644.18]  verse
[4644.18 --> 4644.56]  nine
[4644.56 --> 4645.86]  whenever
[4645.86 --> 4647.04]  whenever
[4647.04 --> 4647.94]  the living
[4647.94 --> 4648.50]  creatures
[4648.50 --> 4649.40]  give
[4649.40 --> 4650.20]  glory
[4650.20 --> 4651.62]  whenever
[4651.62 --> 4652.48]  the living
[4652.48 --> 4652.98]  creatures
[4652.98 --> 4653.58]  worship
[4653.58 --> 4654.66]  the elders
[4654.66 --> 4655.80]  worship
[4655.80 --> 4656.54]  day
[4656.54 --> 4657.12]  and night
[4657.12 --> 4657.32]  they
[4657.32 --> 4657.78]  never
[4657.78 --> 4658.32]  stop
[4658.32 --> 4659.28]  worshipping
[4659.28 --> 4659.80]  whenever
[4659.80 --> 4660.08]  they
[4660.08 --> 4660.42]  worship
[4660.42 --> 4660.94]  the elders
[4660.94 --> 4661.66]  worship
[4661.66 --> 4661.92]  and so
[4661.92 --> 4662.18]  put it
[4662.18 --> 4662.32]  all
[4662.32 --> 4662.64]  together
[4662.64 --> 4662.90]  right
[4662.90 --> 4663.40]  day
[4663.40 --> 4663.64]  and
[4663.64 --> 4663.86]  night
[4663.86 --> 4664.04]  they
[4664.04 --> 4664.26]  never
[4664.26 --> 4664.66]  stop
[4664.66 --> 4665.12]  whenever
[4665.12 --> 4665.76]  they
[4665.76 --> 4666.24]  worship
[4666.24 --> 4667.28]  and so
[4667.28 --> 4667.56]  when
[4667.56 --> 4667.76]  is
[4667.76 --> 4668.04]  heaven
[4668.04 --> 4668.60]  worshipping
[4668.60 --> 4671.12]  it's a real
[4671.12 --> 4671.48]  question
[4671.48 --> 4673.00]  always
[4673.00 --> 4674.20]  absolutely
[4674.20 --> 4675.78]  and so
[4675.78 --> 4676.06]  what does
[4676.06 --> 4676.40]  that mean
[4676.40 --> 4676.90]  for our
[4676.90 --> 4677.42]  worship
[4677.42 --> 4679.90]  that there's
[4679.90 --> 4680.12]  nothing
[4680.12 --> 4680.50]  ordinary
[4680.50 --> 4681.40]  about it
[4681.40 --> 4682.32]  because
[4682.32 --> 4682.68]  we are
[4682.68 --> 4683.22]  invited
[4683.22 --> 4684.06]  up into
[4684.06 --> 4684.62]  the worship
[4684.62 --> 4685.20]  of heaven
[4685.20 --> 4685.74]  which is
[4685.74 --> 4686.04]  happening
[4686.04 --> 4686.76]  always
[4686.76 --> 4688.06]  it means
[4688.06 --> 4688.38]  that when
[4688.38 --> 4689.12]  we gather
[4689.12 --> 4689.86]  we are
[4689.86 --> 4690.22]  joining
[4690.22 --> 4690.58]  with the
[4690.58 --> 4690.94]  voices
[4690.94 --> 4691.76]  of heaven
[4691.76 --> 4692.10]  it means
[4692.10 --> 4692.38]  that we
[4692.38 --> 4692.86]  are singing
[4692.86 --> 4693.64]  praises
[4693.64 --> 4694.00]  with the
[4694.00 --> 4694.38]  praises
[4694.38 --> 4695.06]  of creation
[4695.06 --> 4695.68]  in concert
[4695.68 --> 4696.50]  for the
[4696.50 --> 4696.78]  glory
[4696.78 --> 4697.14]  of our
[4697.14 --> 4697.42]  God
[4697.42 --> 4697.56]  right
[4697.56 --> 4698.08]  that in
[4698.08 --> 4698.62]  ordinary
[4698.62 --> 4699.16]  worship
[4699.16 --> 4699.60]  we are
[4699.60 --> 4700.28]  being pulled
[4700.28 --> 4700.96]  into the
[4700.96 --> 4701.52]  everyday
[4701.52 --> 4702.76]  every moment
[4702.76 --> 4703.54]  of worship
[4703.54 --> 4704.28]  of our
[4704.28 --> 4704.52]  God
[4704.52 --> 4704.76]  and there
[4704.76 --> 4705.52]  is nothing
[4705.52 --> 4706.20]  ordinary
[4706.20 --> 4707.00]  about that
[4707.00 --> 4709.42]  and if you
[4709.42 --> 4709.62]  have your
[4709.62 --> 4710.18]  Bible open
[4710.18 --> 4710.50]  and we're not
[4710.50 --> 4710.76]  going to do
[4710.76 --> 4711.14]  this line
[4711.14 --> 4711.62]  by line
[4711.62 --> 4713.04]  but you
[4713.04 --> 4713.48]  can see
[4713.48 --> 4714.02]  that chapter
[4714.02 --> 4715.14]  5 is a
[4715.14 --> 4715.76]  parallel to
[4715.76 --> 4716.48]  chapter 4
[4716.48 --> 4717.02]  but in
[4717.02 --> 4717.72]  chapter 5
[4717.72 --> 4718.16]  it's about
[4718.16 --> 4718.74]  Jesus
[4718.74 --> 4720.54]  Jesus
[4720.54 --> 4721.54]  because he
[4721.54 --> 4722.04]  is the
[4722.04 --> 4722.88]  lamb who
[4722.88 --> 4723.32]  has been
[4723.32 --> 4723.86]  slain
[4723.86 --> 4724.70]  is found
[4724.70 --> 4725.64]  worthy to
[4725.64 --> 4726.14]  open the
[4726.14 --> 4726.38]  scroll
[4726.38 --> 4726.80]  Jesus
[4726.80 --> 4727.52]  because he
[4727.52 --> 4727.86]  is the
[4727.86 --> 4728.46]  lion of
[4728.46 --> 4728.74]  Judah
[4728.74 --> 4729.48]  Jesus
[4729.48 --> 4730.08]  because he
[4730.08 --> 4730.78]  alone is
[4730.78 --> 4731.28]  worthy to
[4731.28 --> 4731.72]  take the
[4731.72 --> 4732.32]  scroll and
[4732.32 --> 4732.78]  to open
[4732.78 --> 4733.30]  it is
[4733.30 --> 4734.20]  worthy of
[4734.20 --> 4735.04]  our praise
[4735.04 --> 4736.20]  and our
[4736.20 --> 4737.46]  glorifying
[4737.46 --> 4738.28]  worthy is
[4738.28 --> 4738.74]  the lamb
[4738.74 --> 4739.06]  who was
[4739.06 --> 4739.60]  slain to
[4739.60 --> 4740.34]  receive power
[4740.34 --> 4740.90]  and wealth
[4740.90 --> 4741.40]  and wisdom
[4741.40 --> 4741.92]  and strength
[4741.92 --> 4742.42]  and honor
[4742.42 --> 4743.28]  and glory
[4743.28 --> 4743.96]  and praise
[4743.96 --> 4744.84]  to him
[4744.84 --> 4745.36]  who sits
[4745.36 --> 4745.68]  on the
[4745.68 --> 4746.00]  throne
[4746.00 --> 4746.56]  and to
[4746.56 --> 4747.06]  the lamb
[4747.06 --> 4747.74]  be praise
[4747.74 --> 4748.20]  and honor
[4748.20 --> 4748.86]  and glory
[4748.86 --> 4749.52]  and power
[4749.52 --> 4750.04]  forever
[4750.04 --> 4751.36]  and ever
[4751.36 --> 4752.38]  when we
[4752.38 --> 4753.08]  worship
[4753.08 --> 4753.76]  God
[4753.76 --> 4755.12]  centered
[4755.12 --> 4756.48]  on Jesus
[4756.48 --> 4757.48]  and centered
[4757.48 --> 4758.34]  on the
[4758.34 --> 4758.80]  gospel
[4758.80 --> 4759.48]  message
[4759.48 --> 4759.98]  when we
[4759.98 --> 4760.50]  gather
[4760.50 --> 4761.18]  together
[4761.18 --> 4761.94]  week in
[4761.94 --> 4762.74]  and week
[4762.74 --> 4763.02]  out
[4763.02 --> 4763.72]  we are
[4763.72 --> 4764.30]  getting a
[4764.30 --> 4764.64]  glimpse
[4764.64 --> 4765.48]  behind the
[4765.48 --> 4765.88]  screen
[4765.88 --> 4767.38]  we are
[4767.38 --> 4767.92]  seeing
[4767.92 --> 4768.52]  what is
[4768.52 --> 4768.94]  really
[4768.94 --> 4769.42]  happening
[4769.42 --> 4769.90]  up in
[4769.90 --> 4770.22]  heaven
[4770.22 --> 4770.96]  and we
[4770.96 --> 4771.16]  are
[4771.16 --> 4771.70]  invited
[4771.70 --> 4772.10]  to take
[4772.10 --> 4772.42]  part
[4772.42 --> 4772.66]  of it
[4772.66 --> 4773.40]  thousands
[4773.40 --> 4773.78]  upon
[4773.78 --> 4774.30]  thousands
[4774.30 --> 4774.62]  ten
[4774.62 --> 4775.06]  thousands
[4775.06 --> 4775.36]  upon
[4775.36 --> 4775.64]  ten
[4775.64 --> 4776.04]  thousands
[4776.04 --> 4776.72]  plus
[4776.72 --> 4777.40]  you
[4777.40 --> 4777.90]  and me
[4777.90 --> 4779.40]  all the
[4779.40 --> 4779.76]  angels
[4779.76 --> 4780.32]  in heaven
[4780.32 --> 4781.56]  and you
[4781.56 --> 4783.30]  worshiping
[4783.30 --> 4784.00]  our
[4784.00 --> 4784.86]  God
[4784.86 --> 4786.52]  this
[4786.52 --> 4787.32]  begins to
[4787.32 --> 4787.82]  mean so
[4787.82 --> 4788.32]  many things
[4788.32 --> 4788.72]  I trust
[4788.72 --> 4789.18]  that you're
[4789.18 --> 4789.78]  scratching the
[4789.78 --> 4790.28]  surface of
[4790.28 --> 4790.66]  that with
[4790.66 --> 4790.88]  me
[4790.88 --> 4792.74]  but I'll
[4792.74 --> 4793.02]  end with
[4793.02 --> 4793.48]  just this
[4793.48 --> 4796.16]  when we
[4796.16 --> 4796.96]  gather together
[4796.96 --> 4797.56]  for worship
[4797.56 --> 4799.06]  this is
[4799.06 --> 4799.24]  no
[4799.24 --> 4799.72]  ordinary
[4799.72 --> 4800.24]  event
[4800.24 --> 4802.14]  and yet
[4802.14 --> 4803.68]  why do
[4803.68 --> 4804.12]  so many
[4804.12 --> 4804.46]  of us
[4804.46 --> 4804.78]  treat it
[4804.78 --> 4805.16]  like just
[4805.16 --> 4805.42]  another
[4805.42 --> 4805.82]  Sunday
[4805.82 --> 4807.68]  just
[4807.68 --> 4807.90]  another
[4807.90 --> 4808.16]  day
[4808.16 --> 4809.74]  just
[4809.74 --> 4809.90]  an
[4809.90 --> 4810.36]  ordinary
[4810.36 --> 4811.20]  thing
[4811.20 --> 4813.08]  instead
[4813.08 --> 4813.82]  imagine
[4813.82 --> 4815.30]  with me
[4815.30 --> 4815.64]  right
[4815.64 --> 4817.16]  what would
[4817.16 --> 4817.88]  change
[4817.88 --> 4819.02]  if we
[4819.02 --> 4819.42]  gathered
[4819.42 --> 4819.72]  with
[4819.72 --> 4820.70]  expectation
[4820.70 --> 4821.90]  right
[4821.90 --> 4822.14]  if we
[4822.14 --> 4822.42]  gathered
[4822.42 --> 4822.70]  with the
[4822.70 --> 4823.12]  sense of
[4823.12 --> 4823.62]  urgency
[4823.62 --> 4824.02]  that we
[4824.02 --> 4824.16]  are
[4824.16 --> 4824.66]  joining
[4824.66 --> 4825.08]  in
[4825.08 --> 4825.46]  the
[4825.46 --> 4825.68]  very
[4825.68 --> 4826.44]  glories
[4826.44 --> 4826.62]  of
[4826.62 --> 4826.96]  heaven
[4826.96 --> 4828.50]  let's
[4828.50 --> 4828.82]  gather
[4828.82 --> 4829.30]  believing
[4829.30 --> 4829.50]  that
[4829.50 --> 4829.66]  what
[4829.66 --> 4829.80]  we
[4829.80 --> 4829.92]  are
[4829.92 --> 4830.20]  doing
[4830.20 --> 4830.38]  is
[4830.38 --> 4831.18]  opening
[4831.18 --> 4831.66]  up
[4831.66 --> 4832.02]  heaven
[4832.02 --> 4832.34]  to
[4832.34 --> 4832.64]  us
[4832.64 --> 4833.08]  right
[4833.08 --> 4833.38]  here
[4833.38 --> 4833.54]  and
[4833.54 --> 4833.68]  right
[4833.68 --> 4833.86]  and
[4833.86 --> 4834.02]  then
[4834.02 --> 4834.36]  let's
[4834.36 --> 4834.68]  see
[4834.68 --> 4834.92]  how
[4834.92 --> 4835.70]  extraordinary
[4835.70 --> 4836.82]  our
[4836.82 --> 4837.24]  worship
[4837.24 --> 4838.10]  can be
[4838.10 --> 4841.00]  and then
[4841.00 --> 4841.26]  let's
[4841.26 --> 4841.62]  see how
[4841.62 --> 4842.14]  easily
[4842.14 --> 4842.52]  that
[4842.52 --> 4843.04]  gathered
[4843.04 --> 4843.42]  worship
[4843.42 --> 4844.02]  connects
[4844.02 --> 4844.90]  to the
[4844.90 --> 4845.22]  scattered
[4845.22 --> 4847.62]  and
[4847.62 --> 4847.84]  now
[4847.84 --> 4848.26]  okay
[4848.26 --> 4850.66]  unpack
[4850.66 --> 4851.38]  that
[4851.38 --> 4851.84]  discussion
[4851.84 --> 4852.62]  from the
[4852.62 --> 4852.88]  beginning
[4852.88 --> 4853.30]  on why
[4853.30 --> 4853.72]  ascension
[4853.72 --> 4854.02]  day
[4854.02 --> 4854.64]  is
