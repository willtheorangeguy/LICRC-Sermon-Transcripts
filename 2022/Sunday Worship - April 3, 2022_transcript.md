[1919.60 --> 1949.58]  Here I am to worship.
[1949.58 --> 1979.56]  Here I am to say,

[2099.52 --> 2129.50]  Thank you.
[2129.50 --> 2159.48]  Take my life.
[2159.50 --> 2189.48]  Take my voice.
[2189.50 --> 2219.48]  Take my silver and my gold.
[2219.48 --> 2249.46]  Thank you.
[2249.46 --> 2279.44]  Take my love.
[2279.46 --> 2309.44]  Thank you.
[2309.44 --> 2339.42]  I saw that.
[2339.42 --> 2369.40]  on spring break.
[2369.40 --> 2399.38]  I love you.
[2399.38 --> 2429.36]  I think now is the season.
[2429.36 --> 2459.34]  Do you have an idea.
[2459.36 --> 2489.32]  That's true.
[2489.32 --> 2519.30]  I'm a plant.
[2519.30 --> 2549.28]  I'm a plant.
[2549.28 --> 2579.28]  I know.
[2579.28 --> 2609.26]  Who else loved gardens.
[2609.26 --> 2639.24]  Right?
[2639.24 --> 2669.22]  I'm a little bit.
[2669.24 --> 2699.22]  I'm a little bit.
[2699.22 --> 2729.20]  I'm a little bit.
[2729.20 --> 2759.18]  I'm a little bit.
[2759.18 --> 2789.16]  I'm a little bit.
[2789.16 --> 2819.14]  I'm a little bit.
[2819.14 --> 2849.12]  I'm a little bit.
[2849.12 --> 2879.10]  I'm a little bit.
[2879.10 --> 2909.08]  I'm a little bit.
[2909.08 --> 2939.06]  I'm a little bit.
[2939.06 --> 2969.04]  I'm a little bit.
[2969.04 --> 2999.02]  I'm a little bit.
[2999.02 --> 3029.00]  And bring them.
[3029.00 --> 3058.98]  So there will be a little bit.
[3058.98 --> 3088.96]  I have made themselves.
[3088.98 --> 3118.94]  But Moses sought the Lord.
[3118.94 --> 3148.92]  Abraham, Abraham, Abraham, Abraham, Abraham, Abraham, and I will make your descendants.
[3148.92 --> 3178.90]  All right.
[3178.90 --> 3208.88]  Now, this is one of those.
[3208.88 --> 3226.28]  seule-
[3238.88 --> 3244.42]  here this morning, here's the sort of big idea or the theme that we're going to look at.
[3245.14 --> 3253.92]  It is the temptation to make gods of our own making, right, to make our own gods is as old as
[3253.92 --> 3264.20]  humanity itself. What I hope we will see is that the God of the Bible alone is worthy of our worship.
[3264.20 --> 3273.82]  Right, as humans, we are really good at making our own gods. What we need to do is make the God of the
[3273.82 --> 3281.32]  Bible our one and only in our hearts. I'm going to look at that with you through four points or four
[3281.32 --> 3290.84]  questions to frame our time. One, what does it mean to make our own gods? Two, what are the gods we make?
[3290.84 --> 3297.26]  And then three, why do we make those gods in our life? And then fourth, finally, where we will end,
[3297.94 --> 3305.08]  how does the God of the Bible overcome all those other gods? So like we do with numbers, we'll start
[3305.08 --> 3314.42]  at the beginning. Number one, what does it mean to make our own gods? Now for this, I want you to jump
[3314.42 --> 3321.48]  right into the middle of the story that we read actually. With your Bible open, look at verse 7 and 8.
[3321.48 --> 3324.66]  The Lord said to Moses,
[3324.66 --> 3331.92]  go down because your people whom you brought up out of Egypt have become corrupt. They have been quick
[3331.92 --> 3337.96]  to turn away from what I commanded them and have made themselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf.
[3338.32 --> 3344.42]  They have bowed down to it and sacrificed to it and have said, these are your gods, Israel, who brought
[3344.42 --> 3354.84]  you up out of Egypt. Now, if you have the ears to hear it, right, this is a repeat of what was said
[3354.84 --> 3361.70]  just before in verse 3 and 4, but also that language, right, that gods that have brought you up out of
[3361.70 --> 3368.30]  Egypt, again, if you have the ears to hear it, should pickle your memory a little bit, right? It has a bit of a
[3368.30 --> 3376.56]  familiarity to it. Maybe you remember when we were looking back at Exodus 20. Exodus 20 is the giving of
[3376.56 --> 3383.36]  the Ten Commandments. In that very first commandment, God says, I am the Lord your God who brought you out
[3383.36 --> 3391.88]  of Egypt, out of the land of slavery, right? Who brought you out of Egypt? You hear how what we just
[3391.88 --> 3399.90]  read in Exodus 32 is an echo of that phrase, who brought you out of Egypt. It's an intentional callback
[3399.90 --> 3409.18]  for your minds into what was going on in Exodus 20, now seated as the context for Exodus 32. In Exodus 20,
[3409.56 --> 3415.50]  in the introduction to the Ten Commandments, right, we get this statement of who God is. It says, I am the
[3415.50 --> 3421.52]  Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery, and then right away, the first
[3421.52 --> 3427.92]  commandment, you shall have no other gods before me. And then the second command, you shall not make
[3427.92 --> 3433.86]  for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the
[3433.86 --> 3440.44]  waters below. You shall not bow down to them or worship them, for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous
[3440.44 --> 3449.88]  God. Commandment from Exodus 20 is intentionally, contrastingly paralleled with what's taking place
[3449.88 --> 3459.90]  in Exodus 32. And so that contrast feeds into what I want to suggest for us this morning is a working
[3459.90 --> 3469.12]  definition of what it means to make our own gods. And what the people in this story here in Exodus 32
[3469.12 --> 3477.70]  are doing is attributing to the golden calf, either in actuality or as a representative entity of the
[3477.70 --> 3484.00]  broader gods that have helped them, but attributing to the golden calf the work of the one true God,
[3484.78 --> 3493.18]  the work of Yahweh. They're giving this created thing the priority of place in their worship and in
[3493.18 --> 3501.06]  their life and in their heart. In a word, a church word, what we're talking about here is idolatry.
[3501.06 --> 3509.18]  Now, idolatry is whenever you take a good thing and turn it into an ultimate thing. Idolatry is
[3509.18 --> 3515.12]  whenever you take something that is not God and give it that thing, that person, that idea, that
[3515.12 --> 3524.14]  whatever, the throne of your heart. Idolatry is when you attribute to others, whether it's
[3524.14 --> 3531.88]  an accomplishment or a person or a sense or even an emotion, a feeling, right? Whenever you attribute
[3531.88 --> 3539.96]  something other than God or something to other than God, we are committing and practicing making
[3539.96 --> 3547.30]  our own gods, right? What God is doing and what God will do in your life if that gets given over to
[3547.30 --> 3559.52]  something else. Idolatry is always a substitute for who God is supposed to be to you. And let's be really,
[3559.78 --> 3570.62]  really clear. Because you see, idolatry isn't about a wooden idol or a golden calf. Idolatry is ultimately
[3570.62 --> 3580.36]  about the focus of your heart's affections, right? Or the source of your protection and direction in life.
[3581.44 --> 3587.44]  Let me say that again. Idolatry isn't about a wooden idol or a golden calf. Idolatry is about the focus
[3587.44 --> 3594.96]  of your heart's affection and the source of your protection and direction in life. And that's true
[3594.96 --> 3599.20]  for the Israelites, even in this moment, right? They say in verse 1,
[3601.90 --> 3605.60]  come, make us gods who will go before us.
[3606.88 --> 3613.10]  Right? This isn't about the calf itself. This is about having something that they can comprehend,
[3613.64 --> 3619.72]  having something that they can visualize, go before them and prepare a way for them. About something
[3619.72 --> 3626.54]  that they can comprehend and visualize and represent, right? To protect them as they face the wilderness,
[3626.88 --> 3634.56]  as they face the desert that surrounds them. Or even in the verses that we've been looking at in
[3634.56 --> 3642.70]  verse 7 and 8, right? These are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt. Right? They're looking
[3642.70 --> 3649.16]  for a thing that they can understand that has provided for them, that has protected them, a thing that they can
[3649.16 --> 3655.70]  touch, a thing that they can see as maybe representative of a greater reality that cares for them.
[3657.40 --> 3663.90]  And let me be really clear again, right? That longing for transcendence, that longing to be connected
[3663.90 --> 3672.54]  to something wholly other, that longing for the spiritual is good and it is right and it is part of
[3672.54 --> 3681.48]  what it means to be properly human. The question becomes, to whom is your heart directed? And if it's
[3681.48 --> 3687.74]  not God, as revealed in the Bible, the only other choice left is a God of our own making.
[3687.74 --> 3701.90]  And to make our own gods simply means to decide for ourselves what things are worth pursuing.
[3702.68 --> 3709.94]  To decide for ourselves what the purpose of this life is. To decide for ourselves what ultimately
[3709.94 --> 3717.08]  matters. To decide for ourselves the source of our identity and existence in this life and maybe even
[3717.08 --> 3725.60]  in the next. Right? In a sort of hierarchy of being, to make our own gods is to actually put ourselves on
[3725.60 --> 3732.78]  the top of that hierarchy. For we decide what is worth pursuing. We decide what is worth elevating.
[3732.78 --> 3740.08]  We decide where meaning comes from. I toyed with the idea in preparing for this message of having you
[3740.08 --> 3745.04]  all pull out your cell phones right now and pull it in front of you and put it on selfie mode and look
[3745.04 --> 3753.46]  at what you see. Because that's the number one idol in your life. Not the phone, what you see in it.
[3756.70 --> 3761.20]  The spiritual and religious landscape that we live in right now
[3761.20 --> 3770.74]  filled with this idea. Society and culture tells us that we make our own gods because we are God.
[3773.20 --> 3779.40]  Takes us to the second question. Second point for this morning. What are the gods we make?
[3781.30 --> 3781.52]  Now,
[3783.52 --> 3788.14]  at the risk of a gross, overt simplification,
[3788.14 --> 3796.44]  I want to say that not only for us in the 21st century Western cultural world, but really for all
[3796.44 --> 3801.08]  of human history, and that's why I say it, maybe it's a gross oversimplification, but as a student of
[3801.08 --> 3802.48]  history, I think this bears out.
[3805.30 --> 3806.78]  Making gods
[3806.78 --> 3811.42]  for all of human history has been about three things.
[3813.02 --> 3813.50]  Peace,
[3814.96 --> 3815.44]  power,
[3815.44 --> 3817.20]  power, and prosperity.
[3818.94 --> 3819.84]  And like I said,
[3820.68 --> 3824.24]  we don't have time to get into all the weeds of the religious and philosophical
[3824.24 --> 3828.66]  history, but I think it bears it out if we look closely at these three.
[3828.90 --> 3833.34]  Whether it's from the Roman pantheon or the Greek pantheon, whether it's the Egyptian pantheon like we
[3833.34 --> 3838.66]  might have seen here, whether it's even the Hindu pantheon, or even in the more philosophical
[3838.66 --> 3843.62]  traditions and less theistic traditions like Buddhism or Confucianism.
[3843.62 --> 3851.94]  The purpose of making our own gods or godlike ideas, in the latter cases, is to secure for ourselves
[3851.94 --> 3857.00]  and maybe for our community, peace, power, and prosperity.
[3858.00 --> 3859.42]  We all want peace.
[3860.52 --> 3867.06]  That is to say, we all long for a measure of completeness, of wholeness, a measure of comfort
[3867.06 --> 3873.04]  and of safety, a measure of security in this life for ourselves and for those whom we love.
[3874.02 --> 3874.64]  And maybe
[3874.64 --> 3876.46]  for a time,
[3876.82 --> 3880.16]  right, that desire for peace and for comfort and safety,
[3880.56 --> 3881.28]  for security,
[3881.50 --> 3882.40]  maybe for a time
[3882.40 --> 3885.66]  that God goes by the name of Aphrodite
[3885.66 --> 3887.86]  when we locate that in ideas of love.
[3888.46 --> 3891.52]  Maybe for a time that God goes by the name of Dionysus
[3891.52 --> 3893.70]  when we're looking for parties and for fun.
[3893.70 --> 3899.28]  Maybe for a time that God goes by the name of Heket or Hathor from the Egyptian pantheon
[3899.28 --> 3903.40]  when we're looking for the fertility of our crops and its harvest season.
[3903.48 --> 3907.00]  We want the labor of our hands to provide for the things that we need.
[3909.98 --> 3911.50]  But in the world today,
[3911.98 --> 3915.58]  I think all we've done is just lost those old names.
[3917.48 --> 3921.44]  Because we still idolize comfort and security.
[3921.44 --> 3926.52]  We still idolize ease in our lives.
[3927.02 --> 3929.18]  I don't care if you come to church once a week, right?
[3929.26 --> 3930.74]  You're not immune to this.
[3931.98 --> 3938.72]  We live in a world that is built on the very idea that life's purpose is to increase your comfort.
[3940.02 --> 3941.78]  Whether that's, you know, a good retirement
[3941.78 --> 3945.08]  at 66 or 7 or 8 or 55,
[3945.46 --> 3946.24]  if you're lucky enough.
[3946.32 --> 3949.38]  Whether it's cottages or bigger houses or better cars.
[3949.38 --> 3955.48]  We live in a world that is permeated by the notion that you are supposed to secure your safety,
[3955.98 --> 3958.30]  to build up your comfort zones.
[3958.88 --> 3963.54]  We live in a world that believes that your life is supposed to be easy,
[3963.70 --> 3966.50]  or at minimum, it's supposed to get easier, right?
[3966.50 --> 3969.02]  And the truth is,
[3969.08 --> 3969.88]  every one of us,
[3970.14 --> 3971.80]  from me here standing on stage,
[3971.82 --> 3973.00]  to you in your seats,
[3973.06 --> 3973.68]  every one of us,
[3973.70 --> 3976.52]  no matter how holy and sanctified we might be,
[3976.76 --> 3980.24]  every one of us lives in this impulse,
[3980.42 --> 3981.80]  in this temptation.
[3983.06 --> 3985.98]  And the same is true when it comes to ideas of power.
[3985.98 --> 3992.00]  For we are all struggling to eke out our little corner of the world
[3992.00 --> 3994.10]  in which to build our little kingdom
[3994.10 --> 3998.26]  over which we can sit on the throne as kings or queens.
[3999.20 --> 4002.96]  And whether power comes to us as a result of social status
[4002.96 --> 4007.04]  or prestige in business or accomplishment through wealth,
[4007.36 --> 4009.88]  whether power comes to us from physical strength
[4009.88 --> 4013.90]  or a beauty that exceeds the average person around you,
[4014.50 --> 4017.26]  whether power comes from an intellectual capacity
[4017.26 --> 4019.50]  that exceeds the average person
[4019.50 --> 4021.54]  and then looks down on them as a result
[4021.54 --> 4023.22]  and demands more of them
[4023.22 --> 4025.84]  because you are, after all, better than they are, right?
[4025.88 --> 4028.18]  The pursuit of power in the world today
[4028.18 --> 4031.54]  may no longer go by the names of Mars or Ares
[4031.54 --> 4033.36]  as it did in the Greco-Roman world,
[4034.86 --> 4038.70]  but you believe that you have the right
[4038.70 --> 4042.00]  to assert yourself and to define yourself.
[4043.26 --> 4044.82]  Especially now, and here's why I think
[4044.82 --> 4046.26]  this might be the most important message
[4046.26 --> 4047.80]  coming out of Exodus for today,
[4048.16 --> 4049.74]  especially if you are a teenager
[4049.74 --> 4051.80]  or a young adult or a millennial,
[4052.06 --> 4053.94]  you are growing up in a world
[4053.94 --> 4057.06]  that says you have the power
[4057.06 --> 4059.36]  to say this is who I am
[4059.36 --> 4060.96]  and you have to accept it.
[4062.42 --> 4062.54]  Right?
[4062.66 --> 4065.26]  Communal responsibility or external sources
[4065.26 --> 4068.04]  of authority or of an identity
[4068.04 --> 4069.02]  be damned.
[4069.18 --> 4069.98]  None of that matters.
[4070.66 --> 4072.36]  All that matters is your power
[4072.36 --> 4074.58]  to be whomever you say you are.
[4078.10 --> 4078.66]  Finally,
[4079.26 --> 4081.90]  we make our own gods
[4081.90 --> 4084.44]  in the pursuit of peace,
[4084.70 --> 4086.36]  power, and prosperity.
[4087.50 --> 4089.92]  Prosperity itself is a kind of god,
[4090.26 --> 4092.20]  but how we define the good life
[4092.20 --> 4094.50]  and what makes life worth living
[4094.50 --> 4095.52]  comes out of this, right?
[4095.52 --> 4098.28]  How we define what makes us who we are
[4098.28 --> 4099.72]  and what is included
[4099.72 --> 4101.58]  in the sphere of influence
[4101.58 --> 4103.54]  to determine or shape that reality
[4103.54 --> 4105.66]  is part of the prosperity
[4105.66 --> 4107.32]  we are chasing after.
[4108.20 --> 4109.14]  And so maybe
[4109.14 --> 4111.44]  it's a golden calf, right?
[4111.48 --> 4113.60]  That is a symbol itself of wealth
[4113.60 --> 4115.36]  as gold earrings are collected
[4115.36 --> 4116.36]  and jewelry is collected
[4116.36 --> 4117.70]  and it's melted down and made.
[4117.94 --> 4119.80]  Or maybe it's the pursuit of
[4119.80 --> 4122.62]  artha and kama as in Hinduism
[4122.62 --> 4124.42]  or to make the point again
[4124.42 --> 4125.78]  that this doesn't have to be about
[4125.78 --> 4128.46]  gods in the divine being sense.
[4129.44 --> 4130.24]  In Buddhism,
[4130.60 --> 4132.18]  there is a concept called
[4132.18 --> 4133.86]  jingilob,
[4134.00 --> 4135.26]  which translates to
[4135.26 --> 4137.46]  transformation through inspiration.
[4137.88 --> 4139.14]  The idea here
[4139.14 --> 4140.88]  is that we have to tune ourselves
[4140.88 --> 4142.00]  more deliberately
[4142.00 --> 4144.68]  and to be open to the blessings
[4144.68 --> 4146.66]  that the universe has for us
[4146.66 --> 4148.54]  and to be able to receive them.
[4148.54 --> 4150.54]  Again, the root of all this
[4150.54 --> 4151.56]  that ties it all together
[4151.56 --> 4155.00]  is your or my personal prosperity.
[4156.54 --> 4157.72]  And as Christians
[4157.72 --> 4159.22]  in the West,
[4159.88 --> 4161.18]  in the 21st century,
[4161.56 --> 4163.14]  we are just as guilty
[4163.14 --> 4165.08]  of this idolatry.
[4166.88 --> 4168.78]  Wrote a devotional this past week
[4168.78 --> 4170.74]  on Psalm 126
[4170.74 --> 4172.54]  that hits on that point a little bit.
[4172.60 --> 4173.92]  You can find it on the church website.
[4174.72 --> 4175.72]  I'm not going to labor that point
[4175.72 --> 4176.32]  too much more.
[4176.32 --> 4179.10]  The point then
[4179.10 --> 4182.46]  that pulls all these things together
[4182.46 --> 4182.98]  is,
[4183.06 --> 4184.10]  and I think, like I said,
[4184.16 --> 4185.28]  that human history confirms,
[4185.96 --> 4187.94]  we make our own gods
[4187.94 --> 4189.90]  because we are trying to pursue
[4189.90 --> 4191.18]  our own peace
[4191.18 --> 4192.06]  and our own power
[4192.06 --> 4193.30]  and our own prosperity.
[4193.82 --> 4195.22]  In these three things,
[4195.30 --> 4196.72]  we think we have meaning
[4196.72 --> 4198.68]  and purpose in the world.
[4198.74 --> 4199.86]  And in these three things,
[4199.96 --> 4201.10]  we find value.
[4201.24 --> 4202.26]  And in these three things,
[4202.34 --> 4204.86]  we place our heart's affections.
[4204.86 --> 4208.24]  And in all reality,
[4208.64 --> 4211.08]  I believe that is because
[4211.08 --> 4212.30]  we were created
[4212.30 --> 4213.76]  to find peace
[4213.76 --> 4215.74]  and to find and know
[4215.74 --> 4216.96]  and have power
[4216.96 --> 4218.50]  and to find prosperity
[4218.50 --> 4220.90]  in relationship to God
[4220.90 --> 4222.10]  through Jesus Christ.
[4223.00 --> 4223.94]  And now to be clear,
[4224.20 --> 4225.66]  we will define peace
[4225.66 --> 4227.00]  in a particularly new
[4227.00 --> 4228.58]  and transcendent way.
[4228.58 --> 4229.64]  We will define power
[4229.64 --> 4231.52]  in a whole particularly
[4231.52 --> 4232.66]  humbling,
[4233.08 --> 4233.46]  serving,
[4233.82 --> 4234.80]  giving way.
[4234.92 --> 4236.18]  And we will define prosperity
[4236.18 --> 4237.44]  in an other-centered,
[4237.64 --> 4238.44]  agape love,
[4238.52 --> 4240.14]  that's unconditional love
[4240.14 --> 4240.72]  kind of way,
[4240.98 --> 4242.14]  a merciful way
[4242.14 --> 4244.10]  and a full of mercy way.
[4244.10 --> 4246.32]  actually,
[4246.88 --> 4251.54]  we will let God
[4251.54 --> 4253.30]  define those things
[4253.30 --> 4254.62]  by his word
[4254.62 --> 4256.22]  and by his revelation.
[4257.56 --> 4258.82]  But in actuality,
[4259.22 --> 4260.12]  the difference between
[4260.12 --> 4261.46]  what is true and right
[4261.46 --> 4262.98]  and what we were created for
[4262.98 --> 4265.04]  and the gods of our own making
[4265.04 --> 4267.48]  is that we will let God himself,
[4267.66 --> 4268.52]  the transcendent,
[4268.64 --> 4270.16]  holy and holy other being,
[4270.54 --> 4271.74]  speak the truth
[4271.74 --> 4273.12]  about who we are,
[4273.12 --> 4274.70]  about what our purpose is
[4274.70 --> 4276.30]  and about how we find meaning.
[4276.90 --> 4279.16]  He will speak identity to us
[4279.16 --> 4281.70]  and we must submit.
[4283.26 --> 4285.06]  And it's in submitting now
[4285.06 --> 4286.60]  to his truth,
[4286.90 --> 4288.80]  it's in submitting to his will
[4288.80 --> 4289.78]  for our lives
[4289.78 --> 4291.02]  and in seeing ourself
[4291.02 --> 4293.86]  in true relationship to him
[4293.86 --> 4294.88]  as creator
[4294.88 --> 4296.46]  and we as creature
[4296.46 --> 4298.02]  that we can actually,
[4298.52 --> 4299.10]  meaningfully,
[4299.54 --> 4300.34]  lastingly
[4300.34 --> 4302.00]  find peace
[4302.00 --> 4303.02]  and power
[4303.02 --> 4304.28]  and prosperity.
[4309.96 --> 4310.84]  Whenever you
[4310.84 --> 4312.56]  grasp after
[4312.56 --> 4314.84]  what can only come from God,
[4315.18 --> 4316.56]  it's like a reaching out,
[4316.62 --> 4318.02]  says the author of Ecclesiastes,
[4318.42 --> 4319.10]  a reaching out
[4319.10 --> 4320.36]  and chasing after the wind.
[4321.02 --> 4321.20]  Right?
[4321.24 --> 4322.16]  You chase after the wind,
[4322.24 --> 4322.72]  you reach out
[4322.72 --> 4323.36]  and you grab it
[4323.36 --> 4324.30]  and you look to see
[4324.30 --> 4324.86]  what's there.
[4325.96 --> 4326.70]  It's nothing.
[4326.70 --> 4326.74]  It's nothing.
[4326.74 --> 4335.66]  I want you to have something.
[4336.28 --> 4337.72]  I want you to grab hold
[4337.72 --> 4338.36]  of something
[4338.36 --> 4339.22]  and to know
[4339.22 --> 4340.00]  and to live
[4340.00 --> 4341.24]  the very purpose
[4341.24 --> 4342.62]  for which you were created.
[4343.06 --> 4345.04]  I want you to grab hold of God
[4345.04 --> 4347.06]  and in grabbing hold of God,
[4347.56 --> 4348.84]  in grabbing hold of God,
[4348.90 --> 4350.00]  I want you to turn around
[4350.00 --> 4350.74]  and to look
[4350.74 --> 4351.48]  and to realize
[4351.48 --> 4352.36]  in that moment
[4352.36 --> 4353.96]  that he has first
[4353.96 --> 4354.90]  grabbed hold of you,
[4355.50 --> 4357.14]  that he has called you
[4357.14 --> 4357.82]  his own,
[4358.08 --> 4359.36]  that he has made you
[4359.36 --> 4360.06]  his son
[4360.06 --> 4360.86]  or daughter.
[4362.24 --> 4363.64]  And for you to grab hold
[4363.64 --> 4364.56]  of that truth
[4364.56 --> 4365.26]  today,
[4366.62 --> 4370.30]  you to be grabbed hold
[4370.30 --> 4371.96]  of by that truth
[4371.96 --> 4372.82]  today.
[4372.82 --> 4375.10]  We need to know
[4375.10 --> 4375.58]  why it is
[4375.58 --> 4376.20]  that we make
[4376.20 --> 4377.42]  these gods
[4377.42 --> 4378.92]  of our own making.
[4379.46 --> 4380.16]  We need to know
[4380.16 --> 4380.52]  why it is
[4380.52 --> 4381.24]  that we pursue
[4381.24 --> 4382.82]  other and lesser
[4382.82 --> 4383.74]  glories.
[4384.38 --> 4385.84]  That's our third question.
[4385.96 --> 4386.18]  Again,
[4386.54 --> 4387.30]  look at verse 1.
[4389.30 --> 4390.28]  When the people saw
[4390.28 --> 4390.90]  that Moses
[4390.90 --> 4391.94]  was so long
[4391.94 --> 4392.64]  in coming down
[4392.64 --> 4393.34]  from the mountain,
[4393.86 --> 4394.94]  they gathered around Aaron
[4394.94 --> 4395.38]  and said,
[4395.52 --> 4395.76]  come,
[4396.22 --> 4397.30]  make us gods
[4397.30 --> 4397.96]  who will go
[4397.96 --> 4398.96]  before us.
[4398.96 --> 4399.66]  As for this fellow,
[4399.78 --> 4400.04]  Moses,
[4400.16 --> 4400.88]  who has brought us up
[4400.88 --> 4401.36]  out of Egypt,
[4401.88 --> 4402.40]  we don't know
[4402.40 --> 4403.32]  what has befallen him.
[4403.60 --> 4403.94]  We don't know
[4403.94 --> 4404.42]  what has happened
[4404.42 --> 4404.80]  to him.
[4406.84 --> 4407.10]  Now,
[4408.22 --> 4409.08]  what you need to know
[4409.08 --> 4409.96]  is that
[4409.96 --> 4411.76]  this story
[4411.76 --> 4413.22]  follows on the heels
[4413.22 --> 4414.00]  of the story
[4414.00 --> 4415.60]  in Exodus 24.
[4416.06 --> 4416.52]  You can read
[4416.52 --> 4417.32]  that story later.
[4417.44 --> 4418.04]  It's about Moses
[4418.04 --> 4418.74]  going up
[4418.74 --> 4419.70]  to the mountain
[4419.70 --> 4420.54]  with Joshua
[4420.54 --> 4421.20]  and elders
[4421.20 --> 4422.66]  and they leave
[4422.66 --> 4423.36]  the people down.
[4423.46 --> 4423.80]  They have set
[4423.80 --> 4424.28]  a perimeter
[4424.28 --> 4425.02]  around the base
[4425.02 --> 4425.38]  of the mountain.
[4425.48 --> 4425.72]  They say,
[4425.72 --> 4426.88]  don't come any further
[4426.88 --> 4427.44]  than this.
[4428.30 --> 4429.08]  And when Moses
[4429.08 --> 4430.22]  reaches the top
[4430.22 --> 4430.84]  of the mountain,
[4430.96 --> 4431.92]  the glory of God
[4431.92 --> 4433.20]  descends in a cloud
[4433.20 --> 4433.84]  with lightning
[4433.84 --> 4434.60]  and power
[4434.60 --> 4435.90]  and a massive display
[4435.90 --> 4436.76]  and the people
[4436.76 --> 4438.18]  see Moses disappear.
[4439.36 --> 4440.68]  Exodus 24, 18
[4440.68 --> 4441.72]  says that Moses
[4441.72 --> 4442.56]  was on the mountain
[4442.56 --> 4443.80]  for 40 days
[4443.80 --> 4445.10]  and 40 nights.
[4445.96 --> 4446.44]  Now,
[4446.50 --> 4446.88]  that means
[4446.88 --> 4447.34]  by the time
[4447.34 --> 4447.76]  we get now
[4447.76 --> 4448.72]  to chapter 32,
[4449.20 --> 4449.94]  he's been gone
[4449.94 --> 4450.80]  for a little while.
[4452.12 --> 4452.32]  Right?
[4452.34 --> 4452.90]  He's been away
[4452.90 --> 4453.66]  from their presence.
[4456.14 --> 4456.28]  Now,
[4457.12 --> 4458.62]  situate yourself
[4458.62 --> 4460.04]  in this story.
[4461.22 --> 4461.88]  For the past
[4461.88 --> 4463.06]  three or now
[4463.06 --> 4463.96]  four months
[4463.96 --> 4465.52]  as the people
[4465.52 --> 4466.46]  have left Egypt
[4466.46 --> 4467.68]  after seeing God
[4467.68 --> 4468.46]  murk in power
[4468.46 --> 4469.34]  through the plagues,
[4469.72 --> 4469.84]  right,
[4469.88 --> 4470.32]  they have seen
[4470.32 --> 4471.88]  miracle after miracle
[4471.88 --> 4473.00]  after miracle.
[4474.08 --> 4474.94]  And now,
[4475.12 --> 4476.26]  for 40 days,
[4476.62 --> 4477.50]  they've not seen
[4477.50 --> 4478.64]  a display of power.
[4478.76 --> 4479.54]  They've not seen
[4479.54 --> 4480.44]  a change.
[4480.54 --> 4481.40]  They've not seen
[4481.40 --> 4483.12]  something happen.
[4484.36 --> 4485.22]  And I think
[4485.22 --> 4486.74]  that in this,
[4486.90 --> 4487.64]  there is a principle
[4487.64 --> 4488.58]  for our understanding.
[4492.56 --> 4493.40]  Principle for our
[4493.40 --> 4493.84]  understanding
[4493.84 --> 4495.26]  about the danger
[4495.26 --> 4496.76]  of a faith
[4496.76 --> 4497.62]  and a relationship
[4497.62 --> 4498.24]  to God
[4498.24 --> 4499.38]  that is based
[4499.38 --> 4500.92]  on only
[4500.92 --> 4502.80]  displays of power,
[4503.24 --> 4503.86]  that is based
[4503.86 --> 4504.76]  on only
[4504.76 --> 4506.48]  emotional highs
[4506.48 --> 4508.26]  or experientialism.
[4509.42 --> 4509.54]  Right?
[4509.56 --> 4510.42]  I think sometimes
[4510.42 --> 4511.48]  that we
[4511.48 --> 4512.70]  in the
[4512.70 --> 4513.50]  sort of broader
[4513.50 --> 4514.52]  evangelical
[4514.52 --> 4515.66]  Protestant world
[4515.66 --> 4516.66]  have defined
[4516.66 --> 4517.32]  our faith
[4517.32 --> 4518.06]  based on
[4518.06 --> 4518.52]  what we
[4518.52 --> 4519.34]  feel.
[4520.64 --> 4521.16]  And if you don't
[4521.16 --> 4522.10]  feel something
[4522.10 --> 4522.74]  particularly
[4522.74 --> 4523.58]  poignant
[4523.58 --> 4524.62]  or exciting
[4524.62 --> 4525.82]  in worship,
[4526.00 --> 4526.54]  if you're not
[4526.54 --> 4527.26]  crying
[4527.26 --> 4528.06]  week in
[4528.06 --> 4529.10]  and week out,
[4529.14 --> 4529.48]  if you're not
[4529.48 --> 4530.48]  raising your hands
[4530.48 --> 4531.34]  as we are led
[4531.34 --> 4532.72]  by our amazing
[4532.72 --> 4533.84]  worship teams,
[4534.84 --> 4535.88]  that something
[4535.88 --> 4536.88]  isn't real
[4536.88 --> 4537.80]  for you then
[4537.80 --> 4538.42]  or that your
[4538.42 --> 4538.92]  faith is
[4538.92 --> 4539.96]  waning
[4539.96 --> 4541.02]  or gone
[4541.02 --> 4541.66]  or it's
[4541.66 --> 4542.16]  inadequate.
[4542.86 --> 4543.76]  But the reality
[4543.76 --> 4544.06]  is,
[4544.10 --> 4544.48]  what we're beginning
[4544.48 --> 4545.08]  to see here
[4545.08 --> 4546.12]  is that a faith
[4546.12 --> 4546.92]  that is based
[4546.92 --> 4547.84]  on displays
[4547.84 --> 4548.94]  of power
[4548.94 --> 4549.66]  will not
[4549.66 --> 4550.90]  weather 40 days
[4550.90 --> 4551.92]  of seeming absence.
[4552.44 --> 4553.10]  It will not
[4553.10 --> 4553.84]  endure when
[4553.84 --> 4554.50]  your assumptions
[4554.50 --> 4555.34]  crumble.
[4555.64 --> 4556.56]  This kind of faith
[4556.56 --> 4557.12]  that is based
[4557.12 --> 4558.20]  on experientialism
[4558.20 --> 4558.92]  or emotivism
[4558.92 --> 4560.84]  will not last
[4560.84 --> 4561.64]  through the dark
[4561.64 --> 4562.28]  night of the soul.
[4563.54 --> 4564.54]  If the truth
[4564.54 --> 4565.24]  of your faith
[4565.24 --> 4566.14]  is based on
[4566.14 --> 4566.64]  being able
[4566.64 --> 4567.54]  to see Moses,
[4568.54 --> 4569.94]  you're missing God.
[4569.94 --> 4569.98]  God.
[4572.54 --> 4573.50]  And really,
[4573.86 --> 4575.98]  it's no wonder
[4575.98 --> 4576.66]  that people
[4576.66 --> 4577.60]  decided to
[4577.60 --> 4578.62]  create a God
[4578.62 --> 4579.52]  that they could
[4579.52 --> 4580.94]  see after that.
[4581.60 --> 4582.26]  Because that's
[4582.26 --> 4582.84]  what we do.
[4583.92 --> 4584.76]  Since we are
[4584.76 --> 4585.80]  created to be
[4585.80 --> 4586.74]  with God
[4586.74 --> 4587.44]  when we are
[4587.44 --> 4587.86]  not,
[4588.18 --> 4588.90]  other things
[4588.90 --> 4589.42]  or people
[4589.42 --> 4590.12]  or ideas
[4590.12 --> 4591.02]  will rush in
[4591.02 --> 4591.76]  to fill that
[4591.76 --> 4592.14]  gap.
[4592.44 --> 4592.80]  And so,
[4592.98 --> 4593.44]  we make
[4593.44 --> 4594.06]  our own
[4594.06 --> 4594.90]  gods.
[4597.70 --> 4598.20]  And I think
[4598.20 --> 4599.62]  us too,
[4599.62 --> 4599.98]  there's
[4599.98 --> 4601.36]  another
[4601.36 --> 4601.92]  principle
[4601.92 --> 4603.28]  that emerges
[4603.28 --> 4604.78]  from this
[4604.78 --> 4605.14]  story.
[4605.60 --> 4605.86]  And you
[4605.86 --> 4607.38]  can see it
[4607.38 --> 4607.66]  at this
[4607.66 --> 4607.94]  point,
[4608.34 --> 4608.58]  right?
[4611.68 --> 4612.32]  What the
[4612.32 --> 4612.86]  Israelites are
[4612.86 --> 4613.32]  learning and
[4613.32 --> 4613.52]  what we're
[4613.52 --> 4614.10]  seeing here
[4614.10 --> 4615.24]  is that you
[4615.24 --> 4615.86]  can't go
[4615.86 --> 4616.68]  40 days
[4616.68 --> 4617.30]  without seeing
[4617.30 --> 4617.72]  God or
[4617.72 --> 4618.54]  without being
[4618.54 --> 4619.16]  in relationship
[4619.16 --> 4619.88]  meaningfully to
[4619.88 --> 4620.74]  Him and then
[4620.74 --> 4621.58]  assume that
[4621.58 --> 4621.94]  the next
[4621.94 --> 4622.52]  decision you
[4622.52 --> 4623.76]  make will
[4623.76 --> 4624.18]  be the right
[4624.18 --> 4624.44]  one.
[4625.40 --> 4626.16]  Or even a
[4626.16 --> 4626.52]  good one.
[4627.42 --> 4628.12]  And what I
[4628.12 --> 4629.00]  mean by that
[4629.00 --> 4629.60]  is that if
[4629.60 --> 4630.26]  you think,
[4630.38 --> 4630.92]  for instance,
[4631.76 --> 4632.08]  here's an
[4632.08 --> 4632.52]  off-the-cuff
[4632.52 --> 4632.74]  one,
[4633.02 --> 4633.56]  that coming
[4633.56 --> 4633.96]  to church
[4633.96 --> 4634.38]  once a
[4634.38 --> 4635.72]  month or
[4635.72 --> 4636.10]  once in a
[4636.10 --> 4637.00]  while is
[4637.00 --> 4637.58]  enough to
[4637.58 --> 4638.46]  dethrone the
[4638.46 --> 4638.98]  idols that
[4638.98 --> 4639.24]  have been
[4639.24 --> 4639.86]  built up on
[4639.86 --> 4640.38]  your heart
[4640.38 --> 4641.88]  and to keep
[4641.88 --> 4642.54]  Jesus there,
[4643.54 --> 4644.24]  you might be
[4644.24 --> 4644.62]  missing the
[4644.62 --> 4644.94]  point.
[4645.96 --> 4646.32]  But if you
[4646.32 --> 4646.70]  think that
[4646.70 --> 4647.18]  paying lip
[4647.18 --> 4647.78]  service every
[4647.78 --> 4648.20]  once in a
[4648.20 --> 4648.60]  while and
[4648.60 --> 4648.96]  singing a
[4648.96 --> 4649.48]  couple songs,
[4649.86 --> 4650.38]  listening to
[4650.38 --> 4651.10]  a mediocre
[4651.10 --> 4651.72]  sermon and
[4651.72 --> 4652.02]  then maybe
[4652.02 --> 4652.68]  donating to
[4652.68 --> 4653.08]  the church
[4653.08 --> 4653.56]  chairs and
[4653.56 --> 4654.20]  squares fund
[4654.20 --> 4654.96]  is enough
[4654.96 --> 4655.76]  to cancel
[4655.76 --> 4656.22]  out the
[4656.22 --> 4656.92]  formative power
[4656.92 --> 4657.48]  of all the
[4657.48 --> 4657.98]  gods that
[4657.98 --> 4659.04]  are pulling
[4659.04 --> 4659.74]  your heart in
[4659.74 --> 4660.30]  this direction
[4660.30 --> 4660.74]  and that
[4660.74 --> 4661.30]  direction in
[4661.30 --> 4661.76]  this modern
[4661.76 --> 4662.18]  world,
[4664.18 --> 4665.00]  sorry to
[4665.00 --> 4666.14]  say, but
[4666.14 --> 4666.64]  it's not.
[4668.28 --> 4669.94]  You, we,
[4670.32 --> 4671.40]  have become the
[4671.40 --> 4672.58]  Israelites making
[4672.58 --> 4673.60]  a golden calf.
[4673.60 --> 4676.06]  And look,
[4676.72 --> 4678.40]  this is the
[4678.40 --> 4679.10]  sort of thing
[4679.10 --> 4679.80]  that we get
[4679.80 --> 4681.44]  really good at
[4681.44 --> 4683.34]  self-justifying in
[4683.34 --> 4684.00]  our own lives.
[4684.64 --> 4685.52]  The Israelites did
[4685.52 --> 4686.28]  this in our
[4686.28 --> 4686.70]  story.
[4687.12 --> 4688.32]  Aaron cast this
[4688.32 --> 4689.38]  gold idol for
[4689.38 --> 4690.40]  them into the
[4690.40 --> 4691.12]  shape of an idol
[4691.12 --> 4691.80]  and then we
[4691.80 --> 4692.40]  read, did you
[4692.40 --> 4693.08]  notice that, that
[4693.08 --> 4693.96]  he fashioned it
[4693.96 --> 4694.66]  with a tool.
[4696.10 --> 4697.02]  His hands were
[4697.02 --> 4698.06]  involved in making
[4698.06 --> 4698.28]  it.
[4698.52 --> 4698.98]  Now if you were
[4698.98 --> 4699.58]  to read the rest
[4699.58 --> 4700.12]  of the story,
[4700.22 --> 4700.66]  there's this really
[4700.66 --> 4701.48]  interesting part where
[4701.48 --> 4702.26]  Moses comes down
[4702.26 --> 4702.72]  and says, Aaron,
[4702.78 --> 4703.42]  what have you done?
[4703.60 --> 4704.30]  And Aaron says,
[4704.60 --> 4705.42]  look, I just took
[4705.42 --> 4706.14]  the gold, I threw
[4706.14 --> 4706.78]  it in the fire and
[4706.78 --> 4707.52]  a calf came out.
[4709.08 --> 4709.94]  Right, he absolves
[4709.94 --> 4710.40]  himself of
[4710.40 --> 4710.88]  responsibility.
[4711.28 --> 4712.22]  We are really good
[4712.22 --> 4713.74]  at self-justifying
[4713.74 --> 4714.80]  the creation of
[4714.80 --> 4715.96]  our own idols.
[4717.20 --> 4717.80]  But then he says
[4717.80 --> 4718.30]  to the people,
[4718.64 --> 4719.34]  these are your
[4719.34 --> 4720.40]  gods, Israel, who
[4720.40 --> 4721.14]  brought you out
[4721.14 --> 4721.92]  of Egypt.
[4722.46 --> 4722.88]  And then in
[4722.88 --> 4723.46]  verse 5,
[4724.84 --> 4725.64]  right, when Aaron
[4725.64 --> 4726.54]  sees the people
[4726.54 --> 4727.60]  respond to this,
[4728.28 --> 4729.80]  Aaron, when Aaron
[4729.80 --> 4730.80]  saw this, he built
[4730.80 --> 4731.78]  an altar in front
[4731.78 --> 4733.00]  of the calf and
[4733.00 --> 4733.48]  announced,
[4733.96 --> 4734.58]  tomorrow there
[4734.58 --> 4735.04]  will be a
[4735.04 --> 4735.74]  festival to the
[4735.74 --> 4736.00]  Lord.
[4736.78 --> 4737.38]  And so the next
[4737.38 --> 4738.02]  day, the people
[4738.02 --> 4738.90]  rose early and
[4738.90 --> 4739.64]  sacrificed burnt
[4739.64 --> 4740.28]  offerings and
[4740.28 --> 4741.52]  presented offerings
[4741.52 --> 4742.42]  and afterward they
[4742.42 --> 4743.36]  sat down to eat
[4743.36 --> 4744.36]  and drink and got
[4744.36 --> 4745.86]  up to indulge in
[4745.86 --> 4746.26]  revelry.
[4747.86 --> 4749.06]  Right, Aaron sees
[4749.06 --> 4749.74]  what they're doing
[4749.74 --> 4750.66]  and builds them
[4750.66 --> 4752.16]  this altar, this
[4752.16 --> 4752.86]  calf, and then he
[4752.86 --> 4753.78]  builds another altar
[4753.78 --> 4755.32]  and says that there
[4755.32 --> 4756.06]  will be a festival
[4756.06 --> 4756.68]  to the Lord.
[4757.02 --> 4757.72]  Now in this text,
[4757.80 --> 4758.52]  it's fascinating if
[4758.52 --> 4759.18]  your Bibles are open,
[4759.42 --> 4759.96]  you will see that
[4759.96 --> 4760.80]  Lord is there in
[4760.80 --> 4761.36]  all caps.
[4762.24 --> 4762.86]  Right, the covenant
[4762.86 --> 4763.66]  name of God.
[4764.68 --> 4766.44]  And so maybe, maybe,
[4766.62 --> 4767.12]  if we want to give
[4767.12 --> 4767.84]  Aaron the benefit of
[4767.84 --> 4769.02]  the doubt, maybe he's
[4769.02 --> 4770.04]  realizing that he's
[4770.04 --> 4771.00]  done something wrong,
[4771.30 --> 4772.30]  that he's divided the
[4772.30 --> 4773.44]  people's affections from
[4773.44 --> 4774.76]  the Lord to now this
[4774.76 --> 4775.78]  calf and whatever it
[4775.78 --> 4776.22]  represents.
[4776.62 --> 4777.66]  And so he says, oh,
[4777.70 --> 4778.28]  we've got to pull that
[4778.28 --> 4779.00]  back so we're going to
[4779.00 --> 4779.78]  host a festival.
[4780.60 --> 4781.42]  And maybe he has other
[4781.42 --> 4782.84]  ideas or motives, we
[4782.84 --> 4783.98]  can't know, but what
[4783.98 --> 4785.44]  matters to me and for
[4785.44 --> 4786.54]  us in this story is what
[4786.54 --> 4787.42]  the people do in
[4787.42 --> 4787.90]  response.
[4787.90 --> 4789.74]  Right, the next day
[4789.74 --> 4790.78]  the people rose early
[4790.78 --> 4791.86]  and sacrificed burnt
[4791.86 --> 4792.84]  offerings and presented
[4792.84 --> 4793.80]  fellowship offerings.
[4794.88 --> 4795.30]  Do you remember the
[4795.30 --> 4796.08]  previous chapters that
[4796.08 --> 4796.68]  we've just been looking
[4796.68 --> 4796.92]  at?
[4797.66 --> 4798.64]  Right, the whole story
[4798.64 --> 4799.84]  about how the temple
[4799.84 --> 4800.58]  was to, or the
[4800.58 --> 4801.46]  tabernacle was to be
[4801.46 --> 4802.04]  built and how the
[4802.04 --> 4802.68]  things were supposed to
[4802.68 --> 4803.52]  be done and practiced
[4803.52 --> 4804.02]  within it?
[4804.98 --> 4806.70]  The people ask Aaron to
[4806.70 --> 4808.26]  make them an altar, an
[4808.26 --> 4809.50]  idol, and he builds them
[4809.50 --> 4810.68]  an altar to go with that
[4810.68 --> 4811.56]  idol and then they
[4811.56 --> 4812.68]  sacrifice burnt
[4812.68 --> 4813.04]  offerings.
[4813.34 --> 4814.26]  What I mean is, they
[4814.26 --> 4815.04]  did all the right
[4815.04 --> 4815.92]  religious things.
[4815.92 --> 4817.38]  They did all the
[4817.38 --> 4818.84]  right rituals that God
[4818.84 --> 4819.74]  had instructed them to
[4819.74 --> 4821.12]  do and then afterward
[4821.12 --> 4822.42]  they sat down to eat
[4822.42 --> 4823.46]  and drink and got up to
[4823.46 --> 4824.78]  indulge in revelry.
[4825.08 --> 4825.88]  Right, on the one hand
[4825.88 --> 4826.76]  they did all the right
[4826.76 --> 4827.96]  things, on the other
[4827.96 --> 4828.72]  hand the sort of
[4828.72 --> 4830.26]  frivolity that comes to
[4830.26 --> 4831.84]  the aftermath undercuts
[4831.84 --> 4833.26]  the severity of their
[4833.26 --> 4834.68]  actions and suggests
[4834.68 --> 4835.94]  that actually they
[4835.94 --> 4837.12]  aren't really concerned
[4837.12 --> 4838.30]  with what the Lord has
[4838.30 --> 4838.88]  asked of them.
[4839.96 --> 4840.96]  Right, there's a sort of
[4840.96 --> 4843.34]  syncretism, a blending
[4843.34 --> 4845.20]  of priorities and
[4845.20 --> 4846.46]  definitions of peace
[4846.46 --> 4847.64]  and power and
[4847.64 --> 4848.90]  prosperity as God
[4848.90 --> 4850.02]  would define them and
[4850.02 --> 4850.64]  then as the world
[4850.64 --> 4851.84]  around them defines
[4851.84 --> 4853.22]  them and it seems
[4853.22 --> 4854.86]  perfectly acceptable to
[4854.86 --> 4855.08]  them.
[4856.78 --> 4858.12]  This is our danger.
[4860.12 --> 4861.20]  They are unaware
[4861.20 --> 4862.94]  what's going on.
[4863.20 --> 4864.16]  Aaron, their spiritual
[4864.16 --> 4865.36]  leader at this point,
[4865.44 --> 4866.08]  right, like we said, is
[4866.08 --> 4867.06]  either unaware himself
[4867.06 --> 4868.72]  or he's unable to get
[4868.72 --> 4869.62]  a hold of the people's
[4869.62 --> 4870.62]  wandering lusts and to
[4870.62 --> 4872.04]  redirect them and so they
[4872.04 --> 4872.56]  go on.
[4873.06 --> 4874.44]  The danger of self
[4874.44 --> 4875.90]  justification of the
[4875.90 --> 4877.54]  gods that we make is
[4877.54 --> 4879.08]  ours too.
[4883.00 --> 4884.40]  I just want to be happy,
[4885.08 --> 4885.34]  pastor.
[4886.48 --> 4887.94]  You can't stop me from
[4887.94 --> 4888.92]  doing what I love.
[4889.72 --> 4890.78]  I'm not hurting anyone.
[4892.40 --> 4894.36]  I deserve to be able to
[4894.36 --> 4895.10]  get what I want.
[4895.70 --> 4897.64]  I deserve to be whoever I
[4897.64 --> 4898.36]  want to be.
[4899.94 --> 4900.92]  I do what you love.
[4902.04 --> 4903.54]  Grind in that hustle and
[4903.54 --> 4904.60]  bustle through with your
[4904.60 --> 4905.90]  side hustle so that you
[4905.90 --> 4907.48]  can get everything you
[4907.48 --> 4907.88]  need.
[4909.78 --> 4911.36]  I can get everything I
[4911.36 --> 4913.22]  want and you can't get
[4913.22 --> 4914.50]  in my way.
[4917.00 --> 4918.96]  That is the gospel of
[4918.96 --> 4920.54]  modern paganism, of
[4920.54 --> 4921.96]  expressive individualism.
[4922.12 --> 4923.54]  That is the gospel of the
[4923.54 --> 4925.52]  culture around us and it's
[4925.52 --> 4926.38]  being preached from
[4926.38 --> 4927.82]  platforms far more
[4927.82 --> 4929.28]  pervasive and effective
[4929.28 --> 4930.84]  than this stage will ever
[4930.84 --> 4931.18]  be.
[4932.62 --> 4934.28]  And because of its cultural
[4934.28 --> 4935.52]  ubiquity in the world
[4935.52 --> 4937.34]  today, sometimes, most of
[4937.34 --> 4938.44]  the time, we don't even
[4938.44 --> 4939.12]  see it.
[4939.30 --> 4940.30]  We don't even realize that
[4940.30 --> 4941.20]  we are hearing it.
[4941.38 --> 4942.40]  We don't even know that it
[4942.40 --> 4943.44]  is shaping us.
[4943.84 --> 4945.58]  We don't even notice when
[4945.58 --> 4947.84]  it is wedded to our so-called
[4947.84 --> 4950.22]  Christian gospel and then in
[4950.22 --> 4951.72]  effect has changed the gospel
[4951.72 --> 4953.64]  of Jesus to be something it is
[4953.64 --> 4954.04]  not.
[4954.04 --> 4960.02]  Like Paul says so powerfully
[4960.02 --> 4961.40]  in his letter to the
[4961.40 --> 4963.24]  Galatians, whenever you
[4963.24 --> 4964.82]  change the gospel, either by
[4964.82 --> 4966.34]  adding to it or by removing
[4966.34 --> 4968.38]  from it, you nullify it.
[4969.54 --> 4970.94]  It is either the whole gospel
[4970.94 --> 4972.92]  or it is no gospel at all.
[4979.06 --> 4980.20]  The whole gospel.
[4984.04 --> 4987.20]  Before the world began.
[4988.48 --> 4989.94]  Before God even said, let
[4989.94 --> 4991.26]  there be light.
[4991.64 --> 4993.68]  He knew he wanted a people
[4993.68 --> 4995.94]  for himself to be glorified
[4995.94 --> 4997.84]  by them because he is most
[4997.84 --> 4999.06]  worthy of praise.
[4999.58 --> 5001.16]  He is most worthy to be
[5001.16 --> 5001.74]  glorified.
[5002.16 --> 5004.08]  And even when he created and
[5004.08 --> 5005.76]  made the land and the sea, the
[5005.76 --> 5007.82]  birds of the air and all the
[5007.82 --> 5009.94]  animals, even when he had made
[5009.94 --> 5012.14]  humans in his image, he knew.
[5012.14 --> 5014.46]  He knew that they would sin
[5014.46 --> 5015.36]  and that they would wander
[5015.36 --> 5016.22]  away from him.
[5016.54 --> 5020.08]  But God so loved his creation
[5020.08 --> 5023.74]  that he made a promise and he
[5023.74 --> 5024.34]  persisted.
[5025.64 --> 5027.36]  And so in the story of the
[5027.36 --> 5029.04]  world and of history, right, our
[5029.04 --> 5030.52]  first parents did sin.
[5031.10 --> 5032.78]  And because of that sin, all
[5032.78 --> 5034.92]  humanity is marked by our
[5034.92 --> 5036.50]  rebellion against God.
[5036.68 --> 5038.44]  And the truth of the Bible now
[5038.44 --> 5040.24]  is that even though we are more
[5040.24 --> 5042.74]  sinful than we would ever dare
[5042.74 --> 5043.90]  admit or even though we are
[5043.90 --> 5045.12]  more sinful than we could ever
[5045.12 --> 5047.72]  realize because God is so
[5047.72 --> 5050.28]  holy, his holiness demands
[5050.28 --> 5052.40]  absolute perfection and he is
[5052.40 --> 5054.26]  justified in that because he is
[5054.26 --> 5054.64]  God.
[5056.64 --> 5060.32]  And yet, even though the wages of
[5060.32 --> 5063.78]  sin is death, we are yet more
[5063.78 --> 5066.44]  loved by God than we could ever
[5066.44 --> 5068.18]  imagine possible.
[5068.94 --> 5071.32]  And that love of God from before
[5071.32 --> 5073.28]  creation, in fact, that love of
[5073.28 --> 5075.62]  God, which is the overflow of his
[5075.62 --> 5077.24]  love that caused him to create,
[5077.52 --> 5079.44]  that love that God had before the
[5079.44 --> 5081.56]  foundation of the world includes
[5081.56 --> 5083.98]  you by grace through faith.
[5084.24 --> 5087.04]  And out of that love, Jesus, God
[5087.04 --> 5088.94]  himself, the eternal word, the
[5088.94 --> 5091.32]  second person of the Trinity, came
[5091.32 --> 5092.42]  into the world.
[5092.42 --> 5095.18]  Jesus came into the world as an
[5095.18 --> 5095.94]  infant.
[5096.14 --> 5099.06]  God emptied himself of his power and
[5099.06 --> 5102.14]  was born as servant.
[5105.04 --> 5108.04]  The same Jesus lived the life I
[5108.04 --> 5110.76]  should have lived, satisfying God's
[5110.76 --> 5112.02]  righteous demands.
[5112.78 --> 5115.22]  The same Jesus died the death that I
[5115.22 --> 5117.76]  deserve because of my sin.
[5117.96 --> 5120.38]  And this same Jesus was raised three
[5120.38 --> 5123.54]  days later, victorious over sin and
[5123.54 --> 5123.78]  death.
[5123.88 --> 5125.62]  And his resurrection changes
[5125.62 --> 5126.54]  everything.
[5126.70 --> 5129.38]  His resurrection changes history, my
[5129.38 --> 5131.80]  history, your history, all his, all
[5131.80 --> 5132.36]  history.
[5132.70 --> 5134.82]  His resurrection is the victory of
[5134.82 --> 5136.90]  God over sin and death and the
[5136.90 --> 5139.24]  devil over all the idols and gods of
[5139.24 --> 5139.98]  our own making.
[5140.36 --> 5142.92]  And raised victorious, he walked on
[5142.92 --> 5145.18]  this earth again for 40 days and
[5145.18 --> 5147.42]  then ascended to heaven to the right
[5147.42 --> 5149.96]  hand of God the Father as faithful
[5149.96 --> 5152.48]  son, as ruler over all creation.
[5152.92 --> 5156.38]  And King Jesus now speaks to you a
[5156.38 --> 5158.90]  mission and a purpose by sending
[5158.90 --> 5161.34]  with the Father the Holy Spirit to
[5161.34 --> 5163.58]  transform you, to justify and to
[5163.58 --> 5165.64]  regenerate and to sanctify.
[5166.10 --> 5169.40]  You live today, now, to the glory of
[5169.40 --> 5172.46]  God and enjoy him forever.
[5172.46 --> 5176.60]  You live to be used by him to help
[5176.60 --> 5178.36]  others to come to the same.
[5179.50 --> 5180.76]  You and I live.
[5180.88 --> 5183.50]  We have our meaning and our purpose
[5183.50 --> 5186.50]  now in revealing the kingdom come and
[5186.50 --> 5187.46]  the kingdom coming.
[5188.52 --> 5190.02]  And because, make no mistake about it,
[5190.06 --> 5191.60]  right, this gospel message continues.
[5191.92 --> 5193.22]  He is coming back.
[5193.82 --> 5194.74]  He will return.
[5195.10 --> 5196.98]  And what so many people missed that
[5196.98 --> 5199.38]  first time, no one will miss the
[5199.38 --> 5199.98]  second time.
[5199.98 --> 5202.26]  What people can spend their entire
[5202.26 --> 5205.22]  lives denying or ignoring will not
[5205.22 --> 5206.94]  be denied nor able to be ignored.
[5209.12 --> 5214.52]  And so, morning, we're left with a
[5214.52 --> 5214.86]  choice.
[5216.54 --> 5217.62]  We're left with a couple questions.
[5219.32 --> 5222.24]  If you believe in the gospel of the
[5222.24 --> 5223.64]  modern world, of expressive
[5223.64 --> 5226.02]  individualism, if you believe that you
[5226.02 --> 5228.60]  get to decide for yourself, about
[5228.60 --> 5230.84]  yourself, let me ask you, and really, I
[5230.84 --> 5232.04]  want to do this with all pastoral
[5232.04 --> 5233.40]  sensitivity that I can muster.
[5234.98 --> 5235.94]  How's that going?
[5237.68 --> 5238.98]  Right, I'm not trying to be flippant or
[5238.98 --> 5239.66]  dismissive.
[5240.26 --> 5242.88]  I just know that for me, every time I
[5242.88 --> 5245.48]  have tried to define myself by my own
[5245.48 --> 5247.74]  feelings or my own experiences, two
[5247.74 --> 5248.46]  things happen.
[5249.26 --> 5251.54]  Right, one, I live exhausted.
[5251.54 --> 5253.80]  Always exhausted.
[5254.86 --> 5255.88]  It's hard work.
[5255.94 --> 5257.90]  It is impossible work to do it all
[5257.90 --> 5258.26]  myself.
[5258.52 --> 5260.10]  Now, you all are probably better than I
[5260.10 --> 5260.22]  am.
[5260.24 --> 5261.26]  There's no doubt about that.
[5263.30 --> 5266.88]  But if you live exhausted, ask
[5266.88 --> 5269.80]  yourself, am I maybe giving something of
[5269.80 --> 5271.02]  my heart to this other gospel?
[5272.62 --> 5273.98]  Or have I given all of my heart?
[5277.92 --> 5279.60]  Second thing, when I try to live in
[5279.60 --> 5283.98]  this way, there's just no consistency
[5283.98 --> 5285.42]  for me.
[5286.54 --> 5288.22]  Right, my feelings change.
[5288.98 --> 5290.24]  Mike did a great job of this.
[5290.32 --> 5291.34]  Like the weather in March.
[5292.48 --> 5294.74]  Right, snow one day, shorts and t-shirts
[5294.74 --> 5296.72]  the next day, and then rain for about
[5296.72 --> 5297.26]  50 of them.
[5298.98 --> 5301.28]  Right, if I have to base who I am on
[5301.28 --> 5304.38]  what I feel, who I am would never be
[5304.38 --> 5304.78]  solid.
[5305.44 --> 5306.54]  It would never last.
[5306.90 --> 5307.94]  But here's what I want for you.
[5307.94 --> 5309.70]  Here's what the scriptures want for you.
[5309.76 --> 5311.34]  Here's what Jesus wants for you.
[5311.40 --> 5313.08]  He wants you to be solid.
[5314.86 --> 5317.28]  Right, if God is who he says he is,
[5317.44 --> 5318.96]  and of course I believe that he is,
[5319.38 --> 5322.80]  right, it only makes sense that we would
[5322.80 --> 5325.86]  define ourselves by him, in him, and for
[5325.86 --> 5326.12]  him.
[5327.18 --> 5330.08]  And since God is who he says he is,
[5330.44 --> 5333.96]  that means that you can be also who he
[5333.96 --> 5335.64]  says you are.
[5337.98 --> 5339.02]  You are loved.
[5340.30 --> 5343.04]  Not based on what you do, but based on
[5343.04 --> 5343.86]  what he has done.
[5345.18 --> 5348.50]  You are a child adopted by the father,
[5348.62 --> 5351.18]  son and daughter, not based on your
[5351.18 --> 5354.52]  blood, but on his, said on the cross.
[5354.52 --> 5361.10]  You belong to him and to us who believe.
[5361.38 --> 5363.36]  You have a home here.
[5364.70 --> 5367.14]  You are whole in him.
[5367.58 --> 5370.18]  You are truly human, truly alive, maybe
[5370.18 --> 5371.56]  for the very first time.
[5372.26 --> 5375.18]  And that won't ever change.
[5375.28 --> 5377.50]  That can't be taken from you.
[5377.66 --> 5380.86]  That cannot change because God doesn't
[5380.86 --> 5381.66]  change.
[5381.66 --> 5384.14]  Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and
[5384.14 --> 5384.48]  tomorrow.
[5384.60 --> 5386.08]  And that's more than just a cute little
[5386.08 --> 5387.02]  refrain from scripture.
[5387.32 --> 5388.42]  That is a promise.
[5389.92 --> 5392.12]  That means that regardless of the gods
[5392.12 --> 5395.06]  that I have made in my past, I can
[5395.06 --> 5395.90]  change today.
[5396.82 --> 5399.78]  Right, his unchangingness sets me free to
[5399.78 --> 5401.20]  have everything about me changed.
[5402.42 --> 5404.80]  That's the message of true peace.
[5405.28 --> 5407.70]  That's the message of true power from
[5407.70 --> 5408.28]  the Holy Spirit.
[5408.36 --> 5410.14]  And that is the message of true
[5410.14 --> 5414.28]  prosperity, life lived here and now and
[5414.28 --> 5417.28]  forever with God.
[5418.36 --> 5421.32]  That is the gospel I want to proclaim.
[5422.08 --> 5424.78]  That is the gospel that can define you
[5424.78 --> 5425.94]  forever.
[5426.62 --> 5427.08]  Amen?
[5428.54 --> 5428.84]  Pray.
[5430.84 --> 5434.42]  Lord our God, may we submit
[5434.42 --> 5439.04]  ourselves to your definition of who we are.
[5439.04 --> 5443.90]  May we submit ourselves to worship you and
[5443.90 --> 5445.62]  enjoy you forever.
[5445.86 --> 5450.68]  May we submit ourselves to your power and
[5450.68 --> 5452.96]  presence by your beauty.
[5453.58 --> 5457.50]  May we be transformed by the renewing of your
[5457.50 --> 5461.26]  minds in the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[5461.26 --> 5469.42]  Lord God, you are worthy.
[5471.48 --> 5474.30]  May we worship you alone.
[5474.30 --> 5475.94]  Amen.
[5483.72 --> 5485.30]  Please stand with us.
[5485.30 --> 5508.64]  Who else commands all the hosts of heaven?
[5508.64 --> 5514.92]  Who else can make every king bow down?
[5514.92 --> 5521.28]  Who else can whisper and darkness trembles?
[5521.28 --> 5525.92]  Only a holy God.
[5527.86 --> 5532.80]  What other beauty demands such praises?
[5532.80 --> 5538.96]  What other splendor outshines the sun?
[5538.96 --> 5544.84]  What other majesty rules with justice?
[5544.84 --> 5550.30]  Only a holy God.
[5550.30 --> 5560.64]  Come and worship the holy God.
[5560.64 --> 5569.46]  Cry out, sing holy, forever a holy God.
[5569.46 --> 5574.60]  Come and worship the holy God.
[5574.60 --> 5604.58]  Come and worship the holy God.
[5604.58 --> 5606.58]  Holy God.
[5606.58 --> 5607.58]  Holy God.
[5607.58 --> 5608.58]  Holy God.
[5608.58 --> 5611.58]  Come and behold him, the one and the only.
[5611.58 --> 5617.58]  Come and behold him, the one and the only.
[5617.58 --> 5625.58]  Cry out, sing holy, forever a holy God.
[5625.58 --> 5629.58]  Come and worship the holy God.
[5629.58 --> 5630.58]  Holy God.
[5630.58 --> 5631.58]  Holy God.
[5631.58 --> 5632.58]  Holy God.
[5632.58 --> 5633.58]  Holy God.
[5633.58 --> 5636.58]  Come and behold him, the one and the only.
[5636.58 --> 5638.58]  Come and worship the holy God.
[5638.58 --> 5642.58]  Come and worship the holy God.
[5642.58 --> 5643.58]  Christ.
[5643.58 --> 5645.58]  Come and worship the holy God.
[5645.58 --> 5649.58]  Come and worship the holy God.
[5649.58 --> 5671.58]  Come and worship the holy God.
[5671.58 --> 5682.20]  Who else can rescue me from my failings?

[5816.82 --> 5818.66]  Amen
[5818.66 --> 5829.98]  Amen
[5829.98 --> 5846.56]  In Christ alone
[5846.56 --> 5868.52]  My hope is found. He is my light, my strength, my song. This cornerstone, this solid ground, firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
[5868.52 --> 5892.96]  What heights of love, what depths of peace, when fears are stilled, when strivings cease. My comforter, my all in all, here in the love of Christ I stand.
[5898.52 --> 5914.94]  In Christ alone, who took on flesh, fullness of God in helpless faith.
[5914.94 --> 5926.66]  This gift of love and righteousness, scorned by the ones He came to save.
[5926.66 --> 5937.66]  Till on that cross, as Jesus died, the wrath of God was satisfied.
[5938.72 --> 5944.46]  For every sin on Him was laid.
[5944.88 --> 5949.74]  Here in the death of Christ I live.
[5956.66 --> 5967.90]  There in the ground His body lay,
[5967.90 --> 5973.90]  Light of the world by darkness slain.
[5973.90 --> 5979.90]  Then bursting forth in glorious day,
[5980.86 --> 5985.48]  Up from the grave He rose again.
[5986.14 --> 5990.68]  And as He stands in victory,
[5991.94 --> 5997.14]  Sin's curse has lost its grip on me.
[5997.14 --> 6003.36]  For I am His, and He is mine.
[6003.36 --> 6009.66]  Bought with the precious blood of Christ.
[6009.66 --> 6026.32]  No built in life, no fear in death,
[6026.32 --> 6031.84]  This is the power of Christ in me.
[6031.84 --> 6038.16]  From life's first try to final breath,
[6038.16 --> 6042.64]  Jesus commands my destiny.
[6042.64 --> 6049.36]  No power of hell, no scheme of man,
[6049.36 --> 6055.24]  Can ever pluck me from His hand.
[6055.24 --> 6061.38]  Till He returns or calls me home,
[6061.92 --> 6066.74]  Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.
[6066.74 --> 6072.90]  No power of hell, no scheme of man,
[6072.90 --> 6079.08]  Can ever pluck me from His hand.
[6079.08 --> 6085.74]  Till He returns or calls me home,
[6085.74 --> 6092.36]  Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.
[6096.74 --> 6099.52]  Let's see you in the hour...
[6099.52 --> 6103.90]  .
