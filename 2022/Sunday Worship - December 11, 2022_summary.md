• The meaning of "forsaken" is a strong word that can mean to send away or divorce

• The book of Ephesians is a letter written by Paul to the Ephesian church, which he planted on his missionary journey.

• The unity of the church is both internal and local, but also transcendentally and universally expressed across all times and places.

• This type of behavior can lead to disunity and contributes to the problems within the church.
• A key verse, Revelation 2:6, speaks of hating the practices of the Nicolaitans, which Jesus also hates.
• The Nicolaitans are a group or teaching that allowed for the consumption of meat sacrificed to idols, leading to licentious behavior.
• Bible scholars disagree on who or what the Nicolaitans were, but agree on the nature of their teachings.
• The Nicolaitans were a group that abandoned themselves to pleasure and self-indulgence
• Clement of Alexandria wrote about the Nicolaitans, comparing them to goats that eat whatever they can find
• The Nicolaitans' sin was not just their own actions, but also encouraging others to do the same
• Eating meat sacrificed to idols is a lesser concern than the issue of enticement away from truth and driving people into sin
• Jesus hates the Nicolaitans because they break the unity of his bride (the church)
• Self-indulgence divides the church
