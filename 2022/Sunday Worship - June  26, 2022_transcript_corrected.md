[0.00 → 5.76] I say it's under control, but it's not, and you know it.
[6.58 → 13.52] I don't know why it's so hard to admit it, when being honest is the only way to fix it.
[14.00 → 18.86] There's no failure, no fall, there's no sin, you don't already know.
[19.50 → 22.50] So let the truth be told.
[22.50 → 34.42] There's a sign on the door that says come as you are, but I doubt it.
[36.46 → 41.74] Cause if we lived like that was true, every Sunday morning pew would be crowded.
[44.96 → 49.50] But didn't you say church would look more like a hospital?
[49.50 → 58.70] A safe place for the sick, the sinner in the scarred and the prodigal's like me.
[60.46 → 62.62] Will truth be told?
[63.74 → 66.80] The truth is rarely told.
[68.56 → 75.10] Oh, am I the only one who says I'm fine, yeah I'm fine, oh I'm fine, yeah I'm fine.
[75.10 → 77.92] But I'm not, I'm broken.
[78.58 → 82.10] And when it's out of control, I say it's under control.
[82.82 → 85.82] But it's not, and you know it.
[86.58 → 93.46] I don't know why it's so hard to admit it, when being honest is the only way to fix it.
[94.06 → 98.80] There's no failure, no fall, there's no sin, you don't already know.
[98.80 → 102.72] So let the truth be told.
[102.92 → 106.50] Can I really stand here unashamed?
[106.80 → 110.36] Knowing that your love for me won't change.
[110.88 → 118.04] Oh God, if that's really true, then let the truth be told.
[118.04 → 125.86] I say I'm fine, yeah I'm fine, oh I'm fine, hey I'm fine, but I'm not.
[126.34 → 132.16] I'm broken, and when it's out of control, I say it's under control.
[132.34 → 135.32] But it's not, and you know it.
[136.10 → 142.98] I don't know why it's so hard to admit it, when being honest is the only way to fix it.
[142.98 → 148.46] There's no failure, no fall, there's no sin, you don't already know.
[148.98 → 150.10] Yeah, I know.
[150.90 → 155.96] There's no failure, no fall, there's no sin, you don't already know.
[156.58 → 160.02] So let the truth be told.
[160.02 → 176.58] Higher than all, higher than any thought could go.
[177.02 → 181.06] You go beyond, your thoughts reaching heights unknown.
[181.52 → 185.62] Better than all, better than what I think I know.
[185.62 → 190.16] You show the way, leading me to the life you hold.
[190.66 → 194.82] You, give me a life, I'm filled with purpose.
[195.28 → 199.20] You, teach me how to trust what's true.
[199.80 → 203.74] You, open my heart more than I imagined.
[204.30 → 208.32] You, you're ways higher than my heart.
[208.74 → 212.26] Higher than mine, higher than mine, higher than mine.
[212.26 → 216.60] Higher than mine, you're ways higher than mine.
[217.60 → 221.34] Higher than mine, higher than mine, higher than mine.
[222.14 → 225.60] Higher than mine, you're ways higher than mine.
[226.70 → 230.74] Heaven above, heaven above my heart below.
[231.36 → 235.46] You make a way for my heart to reach your throne.
[235.84 → 239.94] Greater than all, greater than what the earth could hold.
[239.94 → 243.96] You, you are the way, leading me to make it.
[244.98 → 249.04] You, give me a life, I'm filled with purpose.
[249.62 → 253.54] You, teach me how to trust what's true.
[254.10 → 258.10] You, open my heart more than I imagined.
[258.68 → 262.40] You, you're ways higher than mine.
[262.94 → 266.60] Higher than mine, higher than mine, higher than mine.
[266.60 → 270.94] Higher than mine, you're ways higher than mine.
[271.76 → 275.70] Higher than mine, higher than mine.
[276.28 → 279.94] Higher than mine, you're ways higher than mine.
[280.82 → 293.94] You, give me a life, I'm filled with purpose.
[293.94 → 300.74] is you teach me how to trust with you
[300.74 → 305.94] open my mind
[323.94 → 343.94] higher than mine
[353.94 → 367.94] higher than mine
[367.94 → 372.94] higher than mine
[372.94 → 376.94] higher than mine
[376.94 → 382.94] higher than mine
[382.94 → 403.94] higher than mine
[403.94 → 407.94] higher than
[407.94 → 411.94] higher than mine
[412.94 → 420.70] Good.
[424.70 → 426.18] How about now?
[426.80 → 427.26] Okay.
[427.58 → 428.44] Good morning.
[429.36 → 431.16] If you weren't awaked, now you are.
[431.68 → 434.18] Welcome to worship.
[434.32 → 441.82] We are so excited to gather together today and so grateful for all of you who have made
[441.82 → 445.10] the right choice in spite of the beautiful weather outside.
[445.26 → 448.06] You're here with us this morning and, so thank you for that.
[448.14 → 449.32] We're really excited.
[449.42 → 450.74] I honestly had no idea.
[450.90 → 455.22] This is the first beautiful weekend we've had in a really long time it feels like and
[455.22 → 458.88], so thank you for joining with us in worship.
[459.00 → 460.62] If you're visiting with us, my name is Chris.
[460.86 → 466.82] I'm one of the pastors here and I, along with a few others, will be leading you in our worship
[466.82 → 468.14] together this morning.
[468.14 → 475.80] So, following our worship this morning, we are having a congregational meeting to approve
[475.80 → 482.48] the financial statement for 2021 and the slate of nominations for new office bearers.
[482.98 → 487.30] If you're visiting with us this morning, we just appreciate your grace and patience.
[487.54 → 492.36] There will be refreshments at the back and so you can hang out there and enjoy that while
[492.36 → 496.44] we take care of some business here, or you can sit and see what that's like.
[496.44 → 500.96] That's entirely up to you, but we will do that immediately following our worship together
[500.96 → 501.46] this morning.
[502.52 → 508.06] Following that yet, after you have a chance to grab a coffee or something, if you are
[508.06 → 516.44] interested in reviewing or recapping or hearing the story of Synod 2022 of the Christian Reformed
[516.44 → 520.20] Church, I will be facilitating that conversation in the multipurpose room.
[520.20 → 525.76] And so, that's just down the what is that, the west hallway right there, the first door
[525.76 → 526.76] there.
[526.76 → 529.12] So, you can join us there for that discussion.
[529.12 → 532.54] I believe that's it as far as announcements go.
[532.54 → 539.04] If I missed one, it's in our e-bulletin which is sent out to those people who have submitted
[539.04 → 540.16] their emails to the office.
[540.16 → 543.52] And so, you can find out more information there.
[544.06 → 547.34] If you are visiting with us, we encourage you to grab one of these forms.
[547.48 → 550.08] They're on the back desk or there's a little QR code.
[550.18 → 552.74] You can scan that with your phone, and they'll take you to a link.
[552.84 → 556.94] We would love to hear from you and connect with you, have the chance to pray for you,
[557.08 → 561.64] hear about your needs and how we might be able to, as a church family, meet them here
[561.64 → 562.34] together.
[562.34 → 569.54] Whether you are a regular worshipper with us or whether you are visiting and however you
[569.54 → 574.68] are able, I want to invite you to stand, and we can be ushered into the presence of our
[574.68 → 575.18] good God.
[579.54 → 583.06] We gather as believers in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[583.26 → 589.78] We gather in his name, and we gather under his greeting and so receive the greeting of our
[589.78 → 590.26] good God.
[590.26 → 598.42] grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son
[598.42 → 602.88] and our Saviour through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[604.06 → 604.42] Amen.
[607.84 → 610.72] Psalm 68, verses 4 to 10.
[611.72 → 617.62] Sing to God, sing in praise of his name, extol him who rides on the clouds.
[617.62 → 625.42] Rejoice before him, his name is the Lord, a father to the fatherless, a defender of widows,
[625.52 → 627.32] is God in his holy dwelling.
[628.18 → 630.30] God sets the lonely in families.
[631.04 → 636.78] He leads out the prisoners with singing, but the rebellious lives in a sun-scorched land.
[637.56 → 643.10] When you, God, went out before your people, when you marched through the wilderness, the earth
[643.10 → 650.80] shook, the heavens poured down rain before God, the one of Sinai, before God, the God of Israel.
[651.30 → 653.62] You gave abundant showers, O God.
[654.18 → 656.26] You refreshed your weary inheritance.
[657.14 → 659.14] Your flock found a dwelling on it.
[659.48 → 663.04] And in your goodness, God, you provided for the poor.
[663.04 → 685.14] The King of my Lord, be the mountain where I run.
[685.14 → 691.96] The fountain I drink from, O He is my song.
[691.96 → 699.50] And the King of my Lord, be the shadow where I hide.
[699.94 → 705.92] The ransom for my life, O He is my song.
[705.92 → 735.90] You are good, O He is my song.
[735.90 → 742.24] Let the King of my Lord, be the wind inside my sails.
[742.72 → 748.56] The anchor in the wings, O He is my song.
[749.56 → 755.98] Let the King of my Lord, be the fire inside my wings.
[755.98 → 762.34] The echo of my days, O He is my song.
[762.34 → 769.16] You are good, O He is my song.
[769.16 → 775.00] You are good, O He is my song.
[775.00 → 781.82] You are good, O He is my song.
[781.82 → 787.66] You are good, O He is my song.
[787.66 → 791.82] You are good, O He is my song.
[791.82 → 798.64] You are good, O He is my song.
[798.64 → 805.46] You are good, O He is my song.
[805.46 → 807.28] You are good, O He is my song.
[807.28 → 812.28] You are good, O He is my song.
[812.28 → 814.10] You are good, O He is my song.
[814.10 → 819.10] You are good, O He is my song.
[819.10 → 820.92] You are good, O He is my song.
[820.92 → 825.92] You are good, O He is my song.
[825.92 → 840.74] You are good, O He is my song.
[840.74 → 846.58] You are good, O He is my song.
[846.58 → 853.40] You are good, O He is my song.
[853.40 → 859.40] You are good, O He is my song.
[859.40 → 867.40] You are good, O He is my song.
[867.40 → 888.22] You are good, O He is my song.
[888.22 → 901.04] When the night is holding on to me, God is holding on.
[901.04 → 917.04] When the night is holding on to me, God is holding on.
[918.22 → 932.04] God is holding on to me, God is holding on to me, God is holding on to me.
[932.04 → 940.10] You are good, O He is my song.
[940.10 → 958.64] I am standing beneath your wings
[958.64 → 964.24] I am resting in your shelter
[964.24 → 973.48] Your great faithfulness has been my shield
[973.48 → 980.32] And it makes me want to sing
[980.32 → 988.06] Blessed be the name of the Lord
[988.06 → 995.56] Blessed be the name of the Lord
[995.56 → 1001.08] I will bless your holy name
[1001.08 → 1004.76] For all my days
[1004.76 → 1010.56] Blessed be the name of the Lord
[1010.56 → 1023.80] I sing praises to your name of the Lord
[1023.80 → 1028.94] For you daily bear my burden
[1028.94 → 1037.16] Your great faithfulness is my reward
[1037.16 → 1043.66] And it makes me want to sing
[1043.66 → 1050.88] Blessed be the name of the Lord
[1050.88 → 1058.24] Blessed be the name of the Lord
[1058.24 → 1063.34] I will bless your holy name
[1063.34 → 1066.88] For all my days
[1066.88 → 1072.24] Blessed be the name of the Lord
[1072.24 → 1079.24] Blessed be the name of the Lord
[1079.24 → 1086.24] Blessed be the name of the Lord
[1086.24 → 1091.74] I will bless your holy name
[1091.74 → 1095.74] For all my days
[1095.74 → 1101.62] Blessed be the name of the Lord
[1101.62 → 1107.92] Bless your name, O Lord
[1107.92 → 1111.74] Your great faithfulness is beyond our understanding
[1111.74 → 1114.68] You, the word, and the life
[1114.68 → 1115.84] Leave us your peace
[1115.84 → 1117.78] That we may rest in your presence
[1117.78 → 1120.04] And your promises through the Holy Spirit
[1120.04 → 1122.86] But daily we leave that peace
[1122.86 → 1125.76] We live restless lives
[1125.76 → 1127.54] Never fully satisfied
[1127.54 → 1131.14] Pushing, striving, bending ourselves to exhaustion
[1131.14 → 1133.26] For ideals out of our reach
[1133.26 → 1136.52] Our chronic distrust of your faithfulness
[1136.52 → 1138.12] Leaves us disquieted
[1138.12 → 1143.62] And yearning for a peace we try to create, buy, and achieve on our own
[1143.62 → 1146.22] But you know we can't do it alone
[1146.22 → 1148.80] You call us to fellowship
[1148.80 → 1153.06] Fellowship with you to find rest for our souls
[1153.06 → 1155.40] Fellowship with our brothers and sisters
[1155.40 → 1158.54] United by you to support and learn from each other
[1158.54 → 1163.14] Amidst our weakness, pain, sorrow, sin
[1163.14 → 1165.92] Your loving arms remain open
[1165.92 → 1168.10] Calling us to Sabbath rest
[1168.10 → 1170.26] By walking in obedience with you
[1170.26 → 1172.72] In your name we pray, amen
[1172.72 → 1172.86] Amen
[1172.86 → 1176.06] All who are thirsty
[1176.06 → 1200.06] All who are thirsty
[1200.06 → 1205.06] All who are weary
[1205.06 → 1206.06] All who are weary
[1206.06 → 1211.22] Come to the fountain
[1211.22 → 1218.30] Give your heart in the stream of life
[1218.30 → 1221.06] In the pain and sorrow
[1221.06 → 1228.06] Be washed away
[1228.06 → 1231.06] In the waves of his mercy
[1231.06 → 1239.14] As he cries out to me
[1239.14 → 1244.80] Sing, come for Jesus
[1244.80 → 1249.00] Amen
[1249.00 → 1251.80] 入所
[1251.80 → 1252.58] O Senhor
[1252.58 → 1252.80] Oh boy
[1252.80 → 1255.84] Jesus
[1255.84 → 1257.80] Oh boy
[1257.80 → 1258.92] Jesus
[1258.92 → 1261.64] Oh boy
[1261.64 → 1263.42] Jesus
[1263.42 → 1267.78] N
[1267.78 → 1278.24] Come, Lord Jesus, come
[1278.24 → 1282.88] All who are thirsty
[1282.88 → 1289.28] All who are weak
[1289.28 → 1293.24] Come to the fountain
[1293.24 → 1298.88] Take your heart in the stream
[1298.88 → 1303.92] Of life with pain and sorrow
[1303.92 → 1308.94] Be washed away
[1308.94 → 1314.08] In the ways of His mercy
[1314.08 → 1321.36] I'll keep my sound to thee
[1321.36 → 1330.00] Sing Holy Spirit, come
[1330.00 → 1341.00] Holy Spirit, come
[1341.00 → 1350.04] Come, Lord Jesus, come
[1350.04 → 1360.52] Come, Lord Jesus, come
[1360.52 → 1362.52] Come, Lord Jesus, come
[1362.52 → 1366.52] Come, Lord Jesus, come
[1366.52 → 1370.52] Come, Lord Jesus, come
[1370.52 → 1372.52] Come, Lord Jesus, come
[1372.52 → 1376.52] Come, Lord Jesus, come
[1376.52 → 1378.52] Come, Lord Jesus, come
[1378.52 → 1382.52] Come, Lord Jesus, come
[1382.52 → 1392.52] Come, Lord Jesus, come
[1392.52 → 1422.52] 
[1422.52 → 1424.52] Come, Lord Jesus, come
[1424.52 → 1428.52] Come, Lord Jesus, come
[1428.52 → 1430.52] Come, Lord Jesus, come
[1430.52 → 1434.52] Come, Lord Jesus, come
[1434.52 → 1436.52] Come, Lord Jesus, come
[1436.52 → 1438.52] Come, Lord Jesus, come
[1438.52 → 1440.52] Come, Lord Jesus, come
[1440.52 → 1442.52] Come, Lord Jesus, come
[1442.52 → 1446.52] Come, Lord Jesus, come
[1446.52 → 1448.52] Come, Lord Jesus, come
[1448.52 → 1452.52] Come, Lord Jesus, come

[1458.52 → 1460.52] Come, Lord Jesus, come
[1460.52 → 1462.52] Come, Lord Jesus, come
[1462.52 → 1464.52] Come, Lord Jesus, come
[1464.52 → 1466.52] Come, Lord Jesus, come
[1466.52 → 1468.52] Come, Lord Jesus, come
[1468.52 → 1470.52] Come, Lord Jesus, come
[1470.52 → 1474.52] Come, Lord Jesus, come
[1474.52 → 1476.52] Come, Lord Jesus, come
[1476.52 → 1478.52] Come, Lord Jesus, come
[1478.52 → 1480.52] May Jesus, come
[1480.52 → 1482.52] Okay, Lord Jesus, come
[1482.52 → 1484.52] Come, Lord Jesus, come
[1484.52 → 1486.52] You lead us sing a song
[1486.52 → 1489.96] the song of your salvation.
[1492.84 → 1498.04] And all your people sing along.
[1498.04 → 1505.60] So remember your jingle,
[1506.30 → 1510.20] remember your children,
[1510.20 → 1516.76] remember your promise, O God.
[1519.00 → 1523.76] Your grace is enough.
[1523.98 → 1527.76] Your grace is enough.
[1528.66 → 1535.24] Your grace is enough for me.
[1535.24 → 1542.36] Your grace is enough.
[1542.36 → 1546.76] Your grace is enough.
[1546.76 → 1553.48] Your grace is enough for me.
[1553.48 → 1560.60] Your grace is enough.
[1560.60 → 1565.16] And reaches out to us.
[1566.04 → 1571.72] Your grace is enough for me.
[1571.72 → 1577.72] Your grace is enough.
[1578.72 → 1583.08] I'm covered in your love.
[1583.08 → 1590.20] Your grace is enough for me.
[1590.20 → 1594.20] For me.

[1628.20 → 1634.20] The offerings today are for the budget and for the North American Indigenous Ministries.
[1634.20 → 1642.60] Tim and Charity Johnson and family work with the Sioux Swap First Nations to develop relationships
[1642.60 → 1644.76] with youth and young families.
[1645.32 → 1649.32] They are working towards a grounded and strong identity,
[1649.32 → 1655.32] understanding of whom the Creator is and His love for us all people.
[1655.32 → 1658.44] Tim writes in his newsletter,
[1658.44 → 1662.84] we are in great need of prayer and preparation for what's coming.
[1662.84 → 1668.44] By the Lord's grace and mercy and as warriors in His kingdom,
[1668.44 → 1676.44] we are fighting for truth, reconciliation, and combating fear, anger, resentment, control,
[1676.44 → 1681.56] and mental situations to name a few.
[1681.56 → 1688.68] We give thanks for the Church whose hearts are filled with generosity and ability to equip us for the battle.
[1688.68 → 1693.56] Every time I think of you, I give thanks to my God.
[1693.56 → 1699.72] Whenever I pray, I make my request for you all with joy.
[1699.72 → 1707.08] For you have been my partners in spreading the good news about Christ from the time of you,
[1707.08 → 1709.64] when you first heard it until now.
[1709.64 → 1715.00] And I am certain that God, who began a good work within you,
[1715.00 → 1721.08] will continue His work until it is finished, on the day when Christ Jesus returns.
[1721.64 → 1723.72] Philippians 1, 3-6
[1723.72 → 1730.60] Next week's special offering is for Refugee Chaplain Dina Nikolai.
[1739.64 → 1754.76] The centre of all history, your cross and resurrection.
[1754.76 → 1767.32] Humiliation lifted me into a new creation.
[1767.32 → 1769.32] I am a new creation.
[1769.32 → 1773.32] I am a new creation.
[1773.32 → 1791.32] My life now yielded to my King, my will to Him surrender.
[1791.32 → 1803.32] Your presence is a treasure.
[1803.32 → 1811.32] It's you alone I treasure.
[1811.32 → 1825.32] Holy, worthy, you have known.
[1825.32 → 1838.32] Holy, worthy, we sing.
[1838.32 → 1840.32] Amen.
[1840.32 → 1841.32] Amen.
[1841.32 → 1842.32] Amen.
[1842.32 → 1843.32] Amen.
[1843.32 → 1844.32] Amen.
[1844.32 → 1858.32] Let every knee on earth bend low, and join the host of heaven.
[1858.32 → 1859.64] Amen.
[1859.64 → 1861.32] Amen.
[1861.32 → 1861.50] Amen.
[1861.50 → 1862.62] Amen.
[1862.70 → 1866.34] Govern работ in the race in our heart.
[1866.34 → 1880.42] Please be safe and inclusive of Him in the creation.
[1880.56 → 1880.72] Amen.
[1880.72 → 1887.20] Thy old cross, sacred shatter
[1887.20 → 1893.68] For Christ our King He reigns alone
[1893.68 → 1899.00] Now and forever after
[1899.00 → 1905.10] Now and forever after
[1905.10 → 1935.08] Now and forever after
[1935.08 → 1965.06] Now and forever after
[1965.06 → 1995.04] Now and forever after
[1995.06 → 2025.04] Now and forever after
[2025.04 → 2055.02] Now and forever after
[2055.02 → 2057.02] Now and forever after
[2057.02 → 2059.02] Now and forever after
[2059.02 → 2061.02] Now and forever after
[2061.02 → 2063.02] Now and forever after
[2063.02 → 2093.02] 
[2093.02 → 2097.10] And so God we praise your name for who you are
[2097.10 → 2099.10] And for what you have done
[2099.10 → 2129.10] 
[2129.10 → 2131.10] Amen
[2131.10 → 2133.10] It's also
[2133.10 → 2135.10] It's also
[2135.10 → 2137.10] It's also
[2137.10 → 2139.10] It's also
[2139.10 → 2141.10] It's also
[2141.10 → 2143.10] It's also
[2143.10 → 2148.10] It's also my privilege this morning to lead us in our church family prayer
[2148.10 → 2156.10] It's also
[2156.10 → 2158.10] It's also
[2158.10 → 2164.04] It's also my privilege this morning to lead us in our church family prayer
[2164.04 → 2172.06] And so invite you to join your heart with mine as we come to God in prayer together
[2172.06 → 2174.06] Let's pray before our God
[2174.06 → 2175.06] Let's pray before our God
[2175.06 → 2194.06] Holy almighty God we gather in your presence as brothers and sisters in Jesus Christ we gather in your presence as those whose hearts are longing for an encounter with you living God we gather in your presence today as those who are living in your presence today as those who are living in your life today are living in your life.
[2194.06 → 2198.42] are longing for an encounter with you, living God.
[2198.52 → 2205.64] We gather in your presence today as those who are full of questions, as those who are
[2205.64 → 2212.34] full of struggles, as those who are full of tears and heartbreak, and we gather today
[2212.34 → 2218.72] as those who are full of rejoicing, as those who are full of celebration and excitement
[2218.72 → 2222.46] for the ways that we have seen you at work in the world.
[2224.06 → 2231.10] And so, God, as we gather together with this incredible mix of emotions and circumstances,
[2231.10 → 2236.38] as we gather together, may we do so as one.
[2238.10 → 2241.64] One body in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2241.96 → 2247.06] Because of the one faith that we share and the one baptism that you have named us with
[2247.06 → 2250.76] and granted us new identity in Christ through.
[2250.76 → 2258.70] In that oneness, we mourn with those who mourn, and we rejoice with those who rejoice.
[2259.74 → 2266.44] God, and in that oneness, we know that it's not a simple binary of mourning or rejoicing,
[2266.44 → 2275.70] but that right now in the depths of our heart is mourning and rejoicing, is celebration and lament,
[2277.42 → 2286.10] is standing firm in the confidence of our faith and struggling with doubt and questions.
[2286.10 → 2297.80] And so, Lord God, with all of who we are, and as who we are all, we come into your presence,
[2298.26 → 2301.54] that we might experience all of you.
[2302.82 → 2308.58] And so, Holy Father, reveal yourself to us through your Son in the power of the Spirit,
[2308.58 → 2316.10] that we might lift these prayers to you, trusting and knowing that you are our constant intercessor.
[2317.54 → 2320.34] You are sovereign o'er all the earth.
[2320.86 → 2323.26] You are the Lord of all creation.
[2324.60 → 2329.12] By your will and your will alone do all things come to pass.
[2329.12 → 2332.46] From the simplest thing of a hair falling out of one's head,
[2332.70 → 2335.26] to the grandest movements of history,
[2335.90 → 2338.14] you are God.
[2339.88 → 2342.66] And so, Lord God, this week,
[2343.08 → 2346.70] we gather in the promise of your work in the world.
[2347.84 → 2350.90] Even as G7 countries gather in Germany
[2350.90 → 2354.42] to discuss the state of global affairs
[2354.42 → 2356.08] and to make plans
[2356.08 → 2361.48] and to ensure peace and prosperity around this world,
[2361.64 → 2363.32] we pray, Lord God, that you would work
[2363.32 → 2364.60] in those movements
[2364.60 → 2367.74] and those circumstances and conversations.
[2369.12 → 2372.24] We pray that as front of mind at those discussions
[2372.24 → 2374.10] is places like Ukraine,
[2374.34 → 2375.62] that you would bring peace,
[2376.28 → 2378.24] bring an end to the war.
[2379.20 → 2380.50] We pray, Lord God,
[2380.50 → 2382.88] that in place of pride,
[2383.08 → 2384.68] there would be humility.
[2386.26 → 2389.80] In place of anger,
[2390.80 → 2392.18] there would be love.
[2394.46 → 2395.64] We pray, Lord God,
[2395.68 → 2397.92] that you would bring peace.
[2399.16 → 2400.22] Put your hand of protection
[2400.22 → 2403.00] on all those who are fleeing from war,
[2403.12 → 2405.54] all those who are hiding from bombs
[2405.54 → 2406.44] that are being dropped.
[2406.78 → 2408.58] Put your hand of protection, Lord God,
[2408.58 → 2411.70] on all those who are crying out
[2411.70 → 2413.02] for this to end.
[2416.38 → 2417.82] And we pray, Lord God,
[2417.86 → 2419.84] as we have circumstance to hear
[2419.84 → 2422.28] from, in particular, missionaries
[2422.28 → 2423.68] on the ground in Ukraine,
[2423.92 → 2426.76] that you would somehow use this
[2426.76 → 2427.56] as an opportunity
[2427.56 → 2429.40] for your gospel to be proclaimed.
[2429.64 → 2430.90] Use this as an opportunity
[2430.90 → 2431.82] for your church
[2431.82 → 2433.66] to reveal your kingdom come
[2433.66 → 2435.02] and your kingdom coming.
[2435.54 → 2438.12] Use the people that you have called,
[2438.12 → 2439.40] sons and daughters
[2439.40 → 2440.34] on the ground
[2440.34 → 2441.10] in Ukraine
[2441.10 → 2442.24] and around the world
[2442.24 → 2443.34] in war-torn countries.
[2444.14 → 2444.86] Use them
[2444.86 → 2447.64] to be makers of peace,
[2449.40 → 2451.26] to be restorers of shalom,
[2453.18 → 2455.12] to be ministers
[2455.12 → 2456.62] of reconciliation.
[2460.04 → 2460.94] Holy God,
[2461.00 → 2463.46] as we go into this week,
[2463.46 → 2465.46] we go mindful
[2465.46 → 2467.74] that we celebrate Canada,
[2468.18 → 2468.82] Canada Day,
[2469.36 → 2470.24] celebrate the country
[2470.24 → 2471.72] that we live in
[2471.72 → 2473.54] and have been blessed by
[2473.54 → 2475.04] and to be a part of.
[2475.42 → 2476.64] And we give you praise
[2476.64 → 2477.68] for the blessings
[2477.68 → 2478.94] that we have experienced
[2478.94 → 2481.04] living here in this country.
[2481.22 → 2483.04] We thank you, Lord God,
[2483.14 → 2486.78] for what you have blessed us with
[2486.78 → 2488.28] in and through this place.
[2488.40 → 2488.72] And yet,
[2489.02 → 2490.54] even as we give offerings
[2490.54 → 2491.82] for name,
[2491.88 → 2492.86] and even as we reflect
[2492.86 → 2493.94] on the work of Tim
[2493.94 → 2494.72] and Charity
[2494.72 → 2495.80] in Shushan,
[2495.88 → 2496.68] we know that
[2496.68 → 2498.36] there are strained
[2498.36 → 2499.96] and broken relationships
[2499.96 → 2502.42] with our indigenous citizens
[2502.42 → 2503.16] as well.
[2503.86 → 2504.28] And so,
[2504.38 → 2504.76] Lord God,
[2504.82 → 2506.76] even as we celebrate
[2506.76 → 2507.48] Canada Day,
[2507.56 → 2508.48] even as we reflect
[2508.48 → 2509.24] on our history,
[2509.44 → 2510.54] may we do so
[2510.54 → 2512.34] not through rose-coloured glasses,
[2512.84 → 2513.88] but may we do so
[2513.88 → 2514.54] seeing clearly
[2515.08 → 2515.54] abuses
[2516.38 → 2517.60] and circumstances
[2517.60 → 2520.10] that should have been
[2520.10 → 2520.96] rejected
[2520.96 → 2521.94] or stopped
[2521.94 → 2522.74] and ideas
[2522.74 → 2523.70] that should have gone
[2523.70 → 2524.36] no further
[2524.36 → 2525.44] than an idea
[2525.44 → 2526.06] and yet
[2526.06 → 2527.54] we cry our
[2527.54 → 2529.18] in brokenness.
[2532.98 → 2533.90] We pray,
[2534.04 → 2534.38] Lord God,
[2534.44 → 2535.00] that you would
[2535.00 → 2537.12] bring reconciliation
[2537.12 → 2540.10] across this country.
[2541.54 → 2542.56] And we pray,
[2542.72 → 2542.86] God,
[2542.94 → 2544.68] that this reconciliation
[2544.68 → 2545.76] would be deep
[2545.76 → 2546.52] and real
[2546.52 → 2547.22] and true
[2547.22 → 2548.56] and not just
[2548.56 → 2549.30] grandstanding
[2549.30 → 2550.72] or virtue signalling,
[2550.92 → 2552.48] not just words
[2552.48 → 2553.30] on a page
[2553.30 → 2553.96] or spoken,
[2554.50 → 2555.40] but would be deep,
[2556.10 → 2557.00] meaningful connection
[2557.00 → 2558.24] and relationship.
[2559.92 → 2560.90] To that end,
[2560.98 → 2561.34] Lord God,
[2561.40 → 2562.20] we pray for
[2562.20 → 2563.50] the political leaders
[2563.50 → 2564.46] in our country,
[2564.64 → 2565.74] for public servants
[2565.74 → 2566.44] who have been called
[2566.44 → 2567.02] into office
[2567.02 → 2567.66] to serve,
[2568.44 → 2569.06] whether that is
[2569.06 → 2570.06] federally
[2570.06 → 2571.58] or provincially
[2571.58 → 2573.06] or municipally.
[2573.38 → 2574.08] We thank you
[2574.08 → 2575.16] for their willingness
[2575.16 → 2575.80] to serve
[2575.80 → 2576.98] and we know
[2576.98 → 2577.68] the challenges
[2577.68 → 2578.58] that many of them
[2578.58 → 2579.44] face,
[2579.72 → 2580.88] especially those
[2580.88 → 2581.82] who are striving
[2581.82 → 2582.76] to live out
[2582.76 → 2583.98] of their Christian faith
[2583.98 → 2585.04] in that call
[2585.04 → 2586.08] and in that service
[2586.08 → 2587.80] and so equip them
[2587.80 → 2588.66] for that work.
[2590.24 → 2590.86] And may we,
[2591.06 → 2591.80] as we are given
[2591.80 → 2592.38] opportunity,
[2592.66 → 2593.36] say thank you
[2593.36 → 2595.24] for that service.
[2596.38 → 2596.56] God,
[2596.60 → 2597.04] we know too
[2597.04 → 2597.52] that there are
[2597.52 → 2598.56] some political parties
[2598.56 → 2600.12] in our country
[2600.12 → 2601.10] that are in leadership
[2601.10 → 2602.14] races right now.
[2602.14 → 2603.22] we pray that you would
[2603.22 → 2605.50] use these circumstances
[2605.50 → 2606.22] as well
[2606.22 → 2608.26] to put the right people
[2608.26 → 2609.78] to accomplish your will
[2609.78 → 2611.80] and to ensure
[2611.80 → 2612.64] the well-being
[2612.64 → 2613.54] of our country
[2613.54 → 2614.60] in place.
[2615.80 → 2616.62] Lord our God,
[2616.68 → 2617.26] as we think about
[2617.26 → 2618.80] leaders in society
[2618.80 → 2619.50] and politics,
[2619.62 → 2620.52] we are also aware
[2620.52 → 2621.16] of leaders
[2621.16 → 2622.62] in the Christian Reformed Church.
[2623.06 → 2623.54] We thank you
[2623.54 → 2624.14] for the synod
[2624.14 → 2624.88] that has just
[2624.88 → 2625.76] taken place
[2625.76 → 2627.90] a couple of weeks ago now.
[2628.00 → 2628.48] We thank you
[2628.48 → 2629.74] for the leaders
[2629.74 → 2630.74] who have served there.
[2630.74 → 2632.58] we praise your name
[2632.58 → 2634.62] for people
[2634.62 → 2636.10] like Colin Watson
[2636.10 → 2637.32] and John Bolt
[2637.32 → 2638.18] and Dee Becker
[2638.18 → 2639.02] who will be,
[2639.18 → 2639.88] have retired
[2639.88 → 2640.90] or who are retiring
[2640.90 → 2641.84] and after many,
[2642.02 → 2642.44] many years
[2642.44 → 2643.48] of faithful service
[2643.48 → 2645.04] to our denomination.
[2645.80 → 2646.68] We praise your name
[2646.68 → 2648.54] for Reverend Dr. Zachary King
[2648.54 → 2649.32] who steps in
[2649.32 → 2650.38] as General Secretary,
[2650.84 → 2652.78] for Reverend Al Post
[2652.78 → 2653.56] who steps in
[2653.56 → 2654.74] as Canadian Director.
[2655.66 → 2655.80] God,
[2655.82 → 2656.44] we know that there are
[2656.44 → 2657.08] these positions
[2657.08 → 2658.04] of senior leadership
[2658.04 → 2659.24] and you call people
[2659.24 → 2660.16] to serve in
[2660.16 → 2660.88] and through them
[2660.88 → 2662.28] and so equip them
[2662.28 → 2663.42] for that task
[2663.42 → 2663.98] but also
[2663.98 → 2664.98] as churches
[2664.98 → 2666.30] part of this denomination
[2666.30 → 2667.22] equip us
[2667.22 → 2668.60] to support them
[2668.60 → 2670.00] and to receive
[2670.00 → 2671.98] assistance
[2671.98 → 2672.74] and direction
[2672.74 → 2673.92] from them.
[2674.38 → 2675.68] May our denominational
[2675.68 → 2677.20] covenant together,
[2677.36 → 2678.26] may our denominational
[2678.26 → 2678.90] relationships
[2678.90 → 2680.50] be more than
[2680.50 → 2681.78] just in name
[2681.78 → 2683.04] but may it be
[2683.04 → 2683.60] in practice
[2683.60 → 2684.28] and function
[2684.28 → 2685.62] as we reveal
[2685.62 → 2686.14] your kingdom.
[2686.14 → 2688.84] pray Lord God
[2688.84 → 2690.30] for the offering
[2690.30 → 2691.32] that we have collected
[2691.32 → 2692.40] for the ministries
[2692.40 → 2693.12] of this church.
[2693.24 → 2693.74] We thank you
[2693.74 → 2695.00] for the many ways
[2695.00 → 2696.16] that you are at work
[2696.16 → 2697.26] in our neighbourhood
[2697.26 → 2698.40] and in our world
[2698.40 → 2699.26] through the kinds
[2699.26 → 2700.58] of things we do here,
[2701.10 → 2701.88] the kinds of people
[2701.88 → 2703.60] that you raise up here
[2703.60 → 2704.70] and then send out
[2704.70 → 2705.78] from this place.
[2706.48 → 2707.38] We pray as well
[2707.38 → 2708.56] for Tim and Charity
[2708.56 → 2709.12] in the work
[2709.12 → 2709.78] that they are doing.
[2710.58 → 2711.62] May they be blessed
[2711.62 → 2712.98] by our connection
[2712.98 → 2713.64] to them
[2713.64 → 2714.34] and may they be
[2714.34 → 2714.80] a blessing
[2714.80 → 2716.02] as they serve
[2716.02 → 2717.42] in Shushed
[2717.42 → 2719.18] and to the indigenous
[2719.18 → 2720.46] population around.
[2721.58 → 2722.90] God, we also pray
[2722.90 → 2724.62] for the congregational
[2724.62 → 2725.30] meeting that will
[2725.30 → 2725.84] take place.
[2726.02 → 2726.58] We thank you
[2726.58 → 2728.38] for the way
[2728.38 → 2729.24] that we can see
[2729.24 → 2730.44] your faithfulness
[2730.44 → 2731.52] to us
[2731.52 → 2732.80] through the financials
[2732.80 → 2733.74] of last year
[2733.74 → 2735.06] and through the
[2735.06 → 2736.20] nomination
[2736.20 → 2737.50] of office bearers
[2737.50 → 2739.18] and we thank you
[2739.18 → 2739.46] God
[2739.46 → 2740.02] for the ways
[2740.02 → 2741.14] that your faithfulness
[2741.14 → 2741.92] is expressed
[2741.92 → 2743.08] through the faithfulness
[2743.08 → 2743.88] of the people here
[2743.88 → 2744.78] in giving
[2744.78 → 2745.60] and in willingness
[2745.60 → 2746.24] to serve.
[2747.38 → 2748.78] Bless that time
[2748.78 → 2749.98] following our worship
[2749.98 → 2751.68] and may it also
[2751.68 → 2753.18] be used for your glory
[2753.18 → 2754.60] and for the proclamation
[2754.60 → 2756.02] of your gospel
[2756.02 → 2756.82] and your kingdom.
[2758.46 → 2759.18] Lord our God,
[2759.24 → 2759.70] this morning
[2759.70 → 2761.40] as we have prayed
[2761.40 → 2762.02] there are many
[2762.02 → 2762.50] of reasons
[2762.50 → 2763.36] to give thanks
[2763.36 → 2764.56] and many reasons
[2764.56 → 2766.00] for which we are mourning.
[2766.94 → 2767.76] And so we celebrate
[2767.76 → 2768.46] with Dave
[2768.46 → 2769.34] and Leanne
[2769.34 → 2770.32] with Megan
[2770.32 → 2770.92] and Dylan
[2770.92 → 2772.64] as they are expecting,
[2773.66 → 2774.84] Dave and Leanne
[2774.84 → 2775.94] expecting a grandchild.
[2776.60 → 2777.30] We pray,
[2777.44 → 2777.78] Lord God,
[2777.86 → 2779.88] that Megan
[2779.88 → 2781.48] would continue
[2781.48 → 2782.94] to be doing well
[2782.94 → 2783.82] and that she would feel
[2783.82 → 2784.86] healthy and strong
[2784.86 → 2785.92] and that this little life
[2785.92 → 2786.60] that is growing
[2786.60 → 2787.76] within her
[2787.76 → 2788.64] would be blessed
[2788.64 → 2789.66] and would come
[2789.66 → 2790.64] in December
[2790.64 → 2792.44] healthy and strong
[2792.44 → 2793.20] and that we might
[2793.20 → 2794.18] celebrate again
[2794.18 → 2796.30] in that time
[2796.30 → 2797.18] with Dave
[2797.18 → 2798.52] and Leanne.
[2800.32 → 2801.12] Father God,
[2801.18 → 2801.92] we want to pray
[2801.92 → 2802.58] as well
[2802.58 → 2804.08] for Harry
[2804.08 → 2805.46] who was in
[2805.46 → 2806.60] a very serious
[2806.60 → 2808.22] workplace accident.
[2810.38 → 2810.94] God,
[2810.98 → 2811.80] even as we hear
[2811.80 → 2812.62] the story
[2812.62 → 2814.70] of what took place,
[2814.90 → 2816.54] it is a miracle
[2816.54 → 2817.46] of your grace
[2817.46 → 2818.70] that he survived.
[2819.34 → 2820.10] It is a miracle
[2820.10 → 2821.02] of your grace
[2821.02 → 2822.72] that all things
[2822.72 → 2823.28] considered
[2823.28 → 2824.00] for what they could
[2824.00 → 2824.34] have been.
[2824.70 → 2825.22] His injuries
[2825.22 → 2826.84] are relatively minor
[2826.84 → 2828.14] and so we praise
[2828.14 → 2828.74] your name
[2828.74 → 2829.38] for your hand
[2829.38 → 2829.94] of protection
[2829.94 → 2830.48] on him
[2830.48 → 2831.26] at that moment.
[2831.78 → 2832.78] We praise your name
[2832.78 → 2834.02] for holding him safe
[2834.02 → 2836.38] and we ask,
[2836.54 → 2836.86] Lord God,
[2836.92 → 2837.34] that you would
[2837.34 → 2838.62] continue to hold him,
[2839.12 → 2839.88] continue to bring
[2839.88 → 2840.64] healing to him.
[2840.74 → 2841.20] We thank you
[2841.20 → 2842.22] for the successful
[2842.22 → 2842.90] surgery.
[2843.10 → 2843.68] We know that there
[2843.68 → 2844.58] may yet be more.
[2845.10 → 2845.68] We pray that you
[2845.68 → 2846.58] would be near to him.
[2847.46 → 2848.24] We pray also,
[2848.38 → 2848.56] God,
[2848.62 → 2849.08] that you would
[2849.08 → 2851.94] make a path
[2851.94 → 2852.80] forward clear
[2852.80 → 2853.36] for what that
[2853.36 → 2854.08] treatment will look
[2854.08 → 2854.84] like and where
[2854.84 → 2855.56] it will look
[2855.56 → 2857.74] and how his
[2857.74 → 2858.30] rehabilitation
[2858.30 → 2859.70] will take place.
[2860.74 → 2861.74] We pray for
[2861.74 → 2864.18] Robin and for
[2864.18 → 2864.92] the whole family
[2864.92 → 2865.90] as they surround
[2865.90 → 2867.06] him in his time
[2867.06 → 2867.54] of need.
[2868.02 → 2869.10] May we surround
[2869.10 → 2870.24] all of them
[2870.24 → 2871.18] in this time
[2871.18 → 2872.30] as well.
[2873.88 → 2874.44] Lord,
[2874.50 → 2874.78] our God,
[2874.84 → 2875.60] we want to pray
[2875.60 → 2877.92] for the relationships
[2877.92 → 2879.16] in our midst,
[2879.72 → 2880.56] the relationships
[2880.56 → 2881.66] that are struggling,
[2882.00 → 2883.34] that are hurting,
[2883.72 → 2885.68] that apart from
[2885.68 → 2886.60] a miracle of your
[2886.60 → 2887.48] intervention are
[2887.48 → 2888.44] falling apart
[2888.44 → 2889.48] and breaking
[2889.48 → 2890.38] around us.
[2890.50 → 2890.86] And so,
[2891.04 → 2891.40] Lord God,
[2891.76 → 2892.64] bring hope,
[2893.38 → 2894.32] bring restoration.
[2895.84 → 2896.80] May we look to
[2896.80 → 2897.80] Jesus Christ
[2897.80 → 2899.08] who gave himself
[2899.08 → 2900.54] up for us
[2900.54 → 2901.60] as the model
[2901.60 → 2902.56] of what it means
[2902.56 → 2904.06] to submit to one
[2904.06 → 2904.64] another out of
[2904.64 → 2905.52] reverence for Christ,
[2905.60 → 2906.18] that we might be
[2906.18 → 2907.02] the kinds of
[2907.02 → 2908.90] husbands and wives
[2908.90 → 2910.28] who willingly give
[2910.28 → 2911.02] of ourselves
[2911.02 → 2912.76] so that the other
[2912.76 → 2914.26] may be lifted.
[2915.78 → 2917.18] Heal our broken
[2917.18 → 2918.80] relationships between
[2918.80 → 2920.06] brothers and sisters,
[2920.66 → 2921.78] family and friends.
[2922.28 → 2923.04] Heal our broken
[2923.04 → 2924.10] relationships between
[2924.10 → 2925.62] parents and children.
[2926.80 → 2927.56] Heal us,
[2927.70 → 2928.04] Lord God,
[2928.10 → 2929.54] that as we see you
[2929.54 → 2930.68] at work in the world,
[2930.76 → 2932.02] we might see these
[2932.02 → 2933.18] kinds of relationships
[2933.18 → 2933.88] restored,
[2934.14 → 2935.04] and we might know
[2935.04 → 2936.12] that as an example
[2936.12 → 2938.54] of your gospel work
[2938.54 → 2940.12] made real
[2940.12 → 2941.02] in our midst.
[2943.30 → 2944.10] Father God,
[2944.20 → 2945.38] today as well,
[2945.54 → 2947.08] we cling to the
[2947.08 → 2947.94] promise of your
[2947.94 → 2949.08] gospel as we
[2949.08 → 2949.88] mourn
[2949.88 → 2951.10] with the
[2951.10 → 2952.02] Rehabs family.
[2953.18 → 2953.92] As we mourn
[2953.92 → 2954.42] and having
[2954.42 → 2956.66] said goodbye
[2956.66 → 2957.86] and laid to rest
[2957.86 → 2959.00] Louise on Friday,
[2959.56 → 2960.82] we pray that you
[2960.82 → 2961.66] would be near to
[2961.66 → 2962.34] each one
[2962.34 → 2963.54] as they journey
[2963.54 → 2964.36] now from
[2964.36 → 2965.34] the graveside
[2965.34 → 2966.28] into
[2966.28 → 2967.92] the rest
[2967.92 → 2968.76] of life
[2968.76 → 2969.62] without mom,
[2970.08 → 2970.94] without spouse,
[2971.16 → 2971.98] without OMA,
[2972.14 → 2973.78] without friend.
[2975.66 → 2976.36] We pray,
[2976.50 → 2976.82] Lord God,
[2976.88 → 2977.70] that you would
[2977.70 → 2979.68] take the truth
[2979.68 → 2981.02] of your gospel,
[2981.18 → 2981.98] the truth of your
[2981.98 → 2982.84] resurrection in
[2982.84 → 2983.50] Jesus Christ,
[2983.58 → 2984.12] and you would
[2984.12 → 2985.66] give us the hope
[2985.66 → 2986.42] that we need.
[2987.54 → 2988.10] Give them
[2988.10 → 2989.58] the hope
[2989.58 → 2990.54] that they need
[2990.54 → 2992.38] to step forward.
[2992.38 → 2995.00] God,
[2995.04 → 2995.66] even in these
[2995.66 → 2996.96] moments of
[2996.96 → 2998.44] the valley of
[2998.44 → 2999.14] the shadow of
[2999.14 → 2999.42] death,
[2999.60 → 3000.64] we pray that you
[3000.64 → 3001.62] would draw near
[3001.62 → 3002.10] to us,
[3002.16 → 3002.58] that you
[3002.58 → 3003.50] would be with
[3003.50 → 3003.68] us,
[3003.72 → 3004.34] that your rod
[3004.34 → 3005.00] and staff
[3005.00 → 3006.02] would comfort
[3006.02 → 3007.28] us and protect
[3007.28 → 3007.56] us.
[3007.66 → 3008.22] We cling
[3008.22 → 3009.16] to you.
[3010.80 → 3011.34] Father,
[3011.42 → 3012.10] we pray the
[3012.10 → 3013.78] same for the
[3013.78 → 3014.42] family of
[3014.42 → 3015.10] Reverend John
[3015.10 → 3015.62] Van Camera,
[3016.26 → 3017.36] who this past
[3017.36 → 3018.36] Thursday was
[3018.36 → 3019.70] also laid to
[3019.70 → 3019.94] rest,
[3020.02 → 3020.64] whose life was
[3020.64 → 3022.92] celebrated at
[3022.92 → 3024.06] a funeral in
[3024.06 → 3024.54] Linden.
[3025.56 → 3026.42] We pray for
[3026.42 → 3028.52] Carolyn and
[3028.52 → 3029.10] for Glenn and
[3029.10 → 3029.72] for the extended
[3029.72 → 3030.44] family there,
[3030.56 → 3031.46] asking that you,
[3031.68 → 3032.08] Lord God,
[3032.14 → 3033.02] would be near to
[3033.02 → 3033.74] them too,
[3034.20 → 3034.96] as they process
[3034.96 → 3036.56] this new reality
[3036.56 → 3037.36] without dad,
[3037.46 → 3038.70] as the extended
[3038.70 → 3039.64] family as well
[3039.64 → 3040.66] processes this
[3040.66 → 3041.50] reality in the
[3041.50 → 3042.18] church community
[3042.18 → 3043.54] that he was an
[3043.54 → 3044.72] integral part of
[3044.72 → 3047.24] processes this.
[3047.34 → 3048.14] We thank you for
[3048.14 → 3049.04] his years of
[3049.04 → 3049.72] service to the
[3049.72 → 3050.04] church,
[3050.18 → 3050.70] and we pray,
[3050.84 → 3051.22] Lord God,
[3051.28 → 3051.86] that even as
[3051.86 → 3052.70] there are hard
[3052.70 → 3053.56] questions around
[3053.56 → 3054.24] grief and
[3054.24 → 3054.98] wrestling in
[3054.98 → 3056.56] his passing,
[3057.16 → 3057.88] that you would
[3057.88 → 3060.34] sustain those
[3060.34 → 3060.98] who mourn.
[3062.00 → 3062.56] You would hold
[3062.56 → 3063.40] us up as we
[3063.40 → 3064.62] walk together.
[3065.84 → 3066.86] May we truly
[3066.86 → 3067.28] know,
[3067.50 → 3067.90] Lord God,
[3067.98 → 3068.40] that no matter
[3068.40 → 3069.46] what valley or
[3069.46 → 3070.44] dark night or
[3070.44 → 3071.78] struggle that we
[3071.78 → 3072.26] face,
[3072.62 → 3074.38] that we are not
[3074.38 → 3075.00] alone,
[3075.88 → 3077.38] that you are
[3077.38 → 3078.14] with us,
[3078.14 → 3078.66] that you have
[3078.66 → 3080.18] called us to
[3080.18 → 3081.46] come near to
[3081.46 → 3081.82] you,
[3082.94 → 3083.34] and that in
[3083.34 → 3083.96] coming near to
[3083.96 → 3084.50] you we would
[3084.50 → 3085.22] find rest.
[3086.30 → 3087.20] Give us your
[3087.20 → 3087.64] yoke,
[3088.08 → 3088.62] Lord Jesus.
[3089.78 → 3090.60] Lay is on us
[3090.60 → 3091.12] that we might
[3091.12 → 3091.94] have your presence
[3091.94 → 3093.94] in our lives.
[3094.60 → 3095.60] We pray now for
[3095.60 → 3096.28] the presence of
[3096.28 → 3097.16] your spirit on
[3097.16 → 3098.04] Pastor Kevin as
[3098.04 → 3098.80] he comes forward
[3098.80 → 3099.64] to preach your
[3099.64 → 3100.52] word to us.
[3101.10 → 3102.28] Speak boldly to
[3102.28 → 3103.38] us through him
[3103.38 → 3104.94] and allow him,
[3105.16 → 3105.54] Lord God,
[3105.54 → 3106.54] to be your
[3106.54 → 3107.24] servant,
[3107.48 → 3108.52] to be your
[3108.52 → 3109.48] vessel for our
[3109.48 → 3110.72] understanding of
[3110.72 → 3111.18] your word.
[3111.40 → 3112.62] Minister grace to
[3112.62 → 3114.06] us through his
[3114.06 → 3115.08] words, we pray,
[3115.46 → 3116.82] in Jesus' name.
[3117.62 → 3117.94] Amen.
[3135.54 → 3148.72] The last couple
[3148.72 → 3149.46] of weeks have
[3149.46 → 3150.08] been full,
[3150.36 → 3150.88] haven't they?
[3152.10 → 3152.72] Are you feeling
[3152.72 → 3153.00] that?
[3154.46 → 3155.18] I don't know about
[3155.18 → 3155.90] you, but between
[3155.90 → 3157.28] graduation ceremonies
[3157.28 → 3158.06] and year-end
[3158.06 → 3159.36] activities, sports
[3159.36 → 3160.80] days and baseball
[3160.80 → 3161.84] tournaments, piano
[3161.84 → 3162.82] lessons, piano
[3162.82 → 3164.18] recitals, hockey
[3164.18 → 3165.10] playoffs, movie
[3165.10 → 3166.02] premieres, final
[3166.02 → 3167.10] assignments, course
[3167.10 → 3168.30] work, and general
[3168.30 → 3169.36] summer upkeep of
[3169.36 → 3170.02] the home and the
[3170.02 → 3171.28] yard, things have
[3171.28 → 3171.90] been a little bit
[3171.90 → 3172.60] nuts lately.
[3173.24 → 3173.84] And that's just my
[3173.84 → 3174.56] personal life.
[3175.80 → 3176.34] What about here at
[3176.34 → 3176.84] the church?
[3177.20 → 3178.28] We've had an intense
[3178.28 → 3179.10] synod a couple
[3179.10 → 3179.94] weeks ago, a
[3179.94 → 3181.12] congregational meeting
[3181.12 → 3182.12] is happening tonight,
[3182.44 → 3183.48] year-end activities
[3183.48 → 3184.08] for all these
[3184.08 → 3184.88] different ministries
[3184.88 → 3185.88] in church, youth
[3185.88 → 3186.90] camps happening next
[3186.90 → 3187.50] week, register
[3187.50 → 3188.10] today, youth,
[3188.14 → 3188.72] that's the deadline.
[3189.70 → 3190.54] Council nominations
[3190.54 → 3191.48] are happening, kids
[3191.48 → 3192.46] camp registrations
[3192.46 → 3193.40] in full swing, we're
[3193.40 → 3194.56] in the midst of
[3194.56 → 3195.60] reactivate sign-up
[3195.60 → 3196.46] for September and
[3196.46 → 3197.04] we're busy looking
[3197.04 → 3197.76] ahead to the fall
[3197.76 → 3198.84] already for the
[3198.84 → 3199.46] ministries, the
[3199.46 → 3200.24] volunteers, the
[3200.24 → 3200.66] leaders, the
[3200.66 → 3201.24] coordinators.
[3202.16 → 3203.06] And that's just the
[3203.06 → 3203.56] stuff that I'm
[3203.56 → 3204.26] involved in, let
[3204.26 → 3204.94] alone all the
[3204.94 → 3205.78] other ministries and
[3205.78 → 3206.56] committees and
[3206.56 → 3207.28] different work that's
[3207.28 → 3208.82] going on in and
[3208.82 → 3209.94] beyond these walls.
[3210.16 → 3210.94] We also know people
[3210.94 → 3211.78] who are celebrating
[3211.78 → 3213.52] and mourning in the
[3213.52 → 3214.58] midst of all of this.
[3214.84 → 3216.04] We rejoiced last
[3216.04 → 3217.22] week as three young
[3217.22 → 3218.06] members of our church
[3218.06 → 3219.60] professed their faith
[3219.60 → 3220.70] in Jesus and we
[3220.70 → 3221.70] celebrated alongside
[3221.70 → 3222.96] seven grade four
[3222.96 → 3223.38] students who are
[3223.40 → 3225.42] graduating outside
[3225.42 → 3226.04] children's worship
[3226.04 → 3226.32] time.
[3226.42 → 3227.64] There's been weddings
[3227.64 → 3228.46] that have been
[3228.46 → 3229.20] connected to members
[3229.20 → 3229.94] of this church, we're
[3229.94 → 3231.04] celebrating new life
[3231.04 → 3232.64] with grandchildren and
[3232.64 → 3233.64] children being born
[3233.64 → 3235.28] and it's been hard
[3235.28 → 3236.04] too.
[3237.42 → 3238.46] People got hurt,
[3239.56 → 3240.32] others are sick,
[3241.26 → 3242.38] we've made hospital
[3242.38 → 3243.34] visits, we've run
[3243.34 → 3244.62] meals to families,
[3246.08 → 3247.62] in the last four days
[3247.62 → 3248.46] we've attended two
[3248.46 → 3249.68] funerals for John and
[3249.68 → 3250.36] for Louise.
[3250.36 → 3252.64] a lot.
[3255.22 → 3256.50] And now we're here and
[3256.50 → 3257.60] I get to preach in the
[3257.60 → 3258.74] midst of all of this and
[3258.74 → 3259.86] it's all just a little
[3259.86 → 3260.98] overwhelming maybe.
[3262.34 → 3263.16] Now some of you, you
[3263.16 → 3264.14] hear all of that and
[3264.14 → 3264.78] you're sitting there and
[3264.78 → 3265.68] you're nodding along and
[3265.68 → 3267.06] you're empathizing because
[3267.06 → 3268.36] this is your life too and
[3268.36 → 3269.42] you're like, yeah, Kevin,
[3269.52 → 3270.48] that is true.
[3272.08 → 3274.24] Or you're sitting there
[3274.24 → 3275.52] rolling your eyes at me
[3275.52 → 3276.50] saying, quit complaining,
[3276.64 → 3277.56] Kevin, we're all busy,
[3277.64 → 3278.90] just get to the message.
[3278.90 → 3281.46] And either way, perfect.
[3282.82 → 3284.30] Because that's the point.
[3285.82 → 3286.80] Life is full.
[3288.66 → 3290.06] And while that little rant
[3290.06 → 3291.14] was not necessarily meant
[3291.14 → 3292.30] for you to empathize with
[3292.30 → 3293.66] me or roll your eyes with
[3293.66 → 3295.14] me, all of you were pretty
[3295.14 → 3296.48] locked in to those last
[3296.48 → 3297.90] two minutes because you
[3297.90 → 3298.62] all feel it.
[3299.56 → 3300.66] We're all busy.
[3302.94 → 3304.20] But maybe we're not
[3304.20 → 3305.04] supposed to be.
[3306.30 → 3307.84] Or better yet, maybe we
[3307.84 → 3308.88] are supposed to be.
[3309.78 → 3311.34] But our response shouldn't
[3311.34 → 3312.60] be empathizing and just
[3312.60 → 3313.78] trudging along as normal
[3313.78 → 3315.76] or rolling your eyes and
[3315.76 → 3316.88] then trudging along as
[3316.88 → 3317.20] normal.
[3317.40 → 3318.62] Maybe the response needs
[3318.62 → 3319.30] to be different.
[3321.20 → 3322.12] So we're going to look at
[3322.12 → 3322.90] that and a few other
[3322.90 → 3323.36] things today.
[3323.44 → 3324.78] We're going to keep going
[3324.78 → 3325.86] through these holy habits
[3325.86 → 3326.68] that we've been working
[3326.68 → 3327.72] our way through these past
[3327.72 → 3328.08] few weeks.
[3328.44 → 3330.14] And today's holy habit is
[3330.14 → 3332.90] finding rest in community.
[3332.90 → 3333.02] community.
[3333.48 → 3333.90] And so we're going to
[3333.90 → 3335.72] look at rest and obedience
[3335.72 → 3337.44] and community together.
[3338.06 → 3338.92] We're going to use two
[3338.92 → 3340.02] texts to do that.
[3340.10 → 3341.10] So the first one we're
[3341.10 → 3342.06] going to look at is in
[3342.06 → 3342.88] Matthew 11.
[3343.00 → 3343.58] So if you have your
[3343.58 → 3344.86] Bibles with you, you can
[3344.86 → 3346.16] turn to Matthew 11 with
[3346.16 → 3346.38] me.
[3346.84 → 3347.84] Pull out your phones or
[3347.84 → 3348.44] whatever you use.
[3348.50 → 3349.20] I think it's going to be on
[3349.20 → 3350.16] the screen behind me as
[3350.16 → 3350.34] well.
[3350.66 → 3351.76] And feel free to read
[3351.76 → 3352.14] along.
[3352.22 → 3353.80] So Matthew 11, three
[3353.80 → 3356.10] verses, verses 28 to 30
[3356.10 → 3356.72] this morning.
[3357.22 → 3358.10] You can read along with
[3358.10 → 3358.22] me.
[3358.28 → 3359.34] There Jesus says this.
[3359.34 → 3362.84] Jesus says, come to me, all
[3362.84 → 3364.10] you who are weary and
[3364.10 → 3365.08] burdened, and I will give
[3365.08 → 3365.54] you rest.
[3365.90 → 3367.96] Take my yoke upon you and
[3367.96 → 3370.08] learn from me, for I am
[3370.08 → 3371.66] gentle and humble in heart,
[3371.96 → 3374.12] and you will find rest for
[3374.12 → 3374.76] your souls.
[3375.92 → 3378.20] For my yoke is easy and my
[3378.20 → 3379.86] burden is light.
[3381.16 → 3382.18] The word of the Lord.
[3384.60 → 3386.66] Jesus says, come to me and
[3386.66 → 3387.84] I will give you rest.
[3387.84 → 3391.96] Come learn from me and you
[3391.96 → 3392.84] will find rest.
[3394.02 → 3396.04] Come to me, Jesus says, for
[3396.04 → 3397.32] I am gentle and humble in
[3397.32 → 3398.64] heart, and you will find
[3398.64 → 3399.62] rest.
[3400.90 → 3402.34] Take my yoke on your
[3402.34 → 3404.02] shoulders, and you will find
[3404.02 → 3406.84] rest for your souls.
[3406.98 → 3409.06] We search for rest in so
[3409.06 → 3410.26] many different places, don't
[3410.26 → 3410.46] we?
[3410.82 → 3412.84] We curl up into a novel or
[3412.84 → 3414.36] we turn on Netflix.
[3414.92 → 3416.26] We count down the days to
[3416.26 → 3417.18] our next vacation.
[3417.84 → 3419.04] We want to tinker in our
[3419.04 → 3420.72] shops or putter in our
[3420.72 → 3422.80] gardens or, for some reason
[3422.80 → 3424.00] beyond my comprehension, go
[3424.00 → 3424.86] for a jog in our
[3424.86 → 3425.28] neighbourhoods.
[3426.48 → 3427.50] Some people are just built
[3427.50 → 3428.28] differently, I guess.
[3429.80 → 3430.72] Point is, we turn to all
[3430.72 → 3431.82] sorts of things to find
[3431.82 → 3433.54] rest, to find solitude, to
[3433.54 → 3434.62] escape a little bit, and
[3434.62 → 3435.54] those things can be good.
[3435.68 → 3436.52] Don't hear me wrong.
[3437.32 → 3440.38] But how often, how often do
[3440.38 → 3442.08] we turn to Jesus when we need
[3442.08 → 3442.42] rest?
[3442.42 → 3445.78] Do we pray as we garden or as
[3445.78 → 3446.24] we tinker?
[3446.42 → 3448.34] Do we worship when we jog?
[3448.92 → 3450.34] Is the book we curl up with
[3450.34 → 3451.50] ever God's word?
[3453.22 → 3455.04] Jesus says, if you are weary
[3455.04 → 3456.90] and burdened, you need to go
[3456.90 → 3458.48] to him, and we will find rest.
[3458.74 → 3460.80] Our rest is in him, but is he
[3460.80 → 3462.28] the first place we turn for
[3462.28 → 3462.78] that rest?
[3464.58 → 3465.94] I love this passage we read
[3465.94 → 3467.72] because Jesus doesn't say,
[3468.02 → 3469.88] come to me and then sit down and
[3469.88 → 3471.08] take a nap, and you will be
[3471.08 → 3471.42] rested.
[3472.70 → 3474.62] He actually says, take my
[3474.62 → 3477.58] yoke upon you, and you will
[3477.58 → 3478.32] find rest.
[3479.62 → 3481.38] The yoke of an ox, the work.
[3484.12 → 3485.88] Our rest is not found in Jesus
[3485.88 → 3487.28] when we stop working.
[3488.90 → 3490.40] Jesus says our rest is found
[3490.40 → 3492.70] when we start working for him.
[3492.78 → 3494.20] We start doing his work.
[3495.06 → 3496.74] When we take on his yoke, when
[3496.74 → 3499.54] we obey him and take on his
[3499.54 → 3502.20] work for him, for us, for his
[3502.20 → 3504.98] kingdom, then we will find rest.
[3506.12 → 3508.94] Not when we stop, but when we
[3508.94 → 3509.38] obey.
[3511.08 → 3512.80] We experience this rest in Jesus
[3512.80 → 3514.22] because we know that in this
[3514.22 → 3515.40] world we will have trouble.
[3515.66 → 3517.26] We've experienced that recently.
[3517.26 → 3521.84] we know that Jesus has overcome the
[3521.84 → 3522.16] world.
[3522.30 → 3523.86] John 16, 33 tells us this.
[3523.92 → 3526.22] Jesus came into the world knowing
[3526.22 → 3528.96] that there would be hardship.
[3529.38 → 3530.52] Knowing that we were sinful.
[3530.90 → 3532.18] Knowing that we would be busy.
[3534.06 → 3535.62] And so Jesus came into this world
[3535.62 → 3537.30] and he lived this perfect life that
[3537.30 → 3538.48] you and I have not lived.
[3538.64 → 3540.44] And then he died a death that we all
[3540.44 → 3541.36] deserve to die.
[3541.90 → 3544.94] But three days later he rose again
[3544.94 → 3548.22] from the tomb, and he defeated sin
[3548.22 → 3549.88] and death once and for all.
[3549.94 → 3551.22] And then he ascended into heaven.
[3551.78 → 3553.08] And he is sitting on his heavenly
[3553.08 → 3555.14] throne mediating on our behalf.
[3555.24 → 3557.56] So now whenever we feel burdened by
[3557.56 → 3559.60] this world, whenever we are overcome
[3559.60 → 3562.06] by this world, whenever we're
[3562.06 → 3563.58] burdened by the busyness of this
[3563.58 → 3566.48] life, we can remember what he has
[3566.48 → 3567.16] accomplished.
[3567.98 → 3569.40] And we could turn to him and
[3569.40 → 3572.64] believe in him and work for him
[3572.64 → 3575.70] and experience his eternal rest.
[3575.76 → 3577.04] Because of what he accomplished,
[3577.54 → 3578.58] we are saved.
[3578.84 → 3580.38] And our response is to take his
[3580.38 → 3583.48] yoke on our shoulders and follow
[3583.48 → 3585.32] him and live for him.
[3585.54 → 3588.60] Our rest is in him and our calling
[3588.60 → 3589.64] is to obey him.
[3591.72 → 3592.82] Let's rest in obedience.
[3592.96 → 3593.72] But what about community?
[3593.86 → 3595.52] Well, our second text today shows us
[3595.52 → 3595.66] this.
[3595.74 → 3596.76] Turn with me in your Bibles now to
[3596.76 → 3597.46] 1 John.
[3597.64 → 3598.64] 1 John 1.
[3598.72 → 3600.74] We're going to read verses 5 to 7.
[3600.74 → 3601.76] And a reminder, this isn't the
[3601.76 → 3602.50] Gospel of John.
[3602.56 → 3603.38] This is one of his letters.
[3603.66 → 3604.42] So it's in the back.
[3604.92 → 3605.78] Right towards the back.
[3605.88 → 3609.32] 1 John 1 verses 5 to 7 says this.
[3610.58 → 3611.86] This is a message that we have
[3611.86 → 3613.48] heard from him and declare to you.
[3613.62 → 3615.04] God is light.
[3615.66 → 3617.50] In him there is no darkness at all.
[3617.80 → 3619.64] If we claim to have fellowship with
[3619.64 → 3621.64] him and yet walk in the darkness,
[3622.08 → 3624.88] we lie and do not live out the truth.
[3624.88 → 3629.30] But if we walk in the light as he is
[3629.30 → 3631.60] in the light, we have fellowship with
[3631.60 → 3632.28] one another.
[3633.24 → 3635.58] In the blood of Jesus, his son purifies
[3635.58 → 3637.10] us from all sin.
[3640.70 → 3641.70] God is light.
[3641.78 → 3643.24] And if he is light, we will have
[3643.24 → 3645.32] fellowship with one another.
[3645.48 → 3647.76] If we take his yoke upon us, we will
[3647.76 → 3648.38] find rest.
[3648.52 → 3650.22] If we walk in the light, we have
[3650.22 → 3653.42] fellowship with one another and find
[3653.42 → 3653.82] rest.
[3653.96 → 3655.14] Rest in community.
[3656.20 → 3657.96] This is how we live out our faith
[3657.96 → 3659.14] in the craziness of this world.
[3659.34 → 3660.64] We take Christ's yoke on our
[3660.64 → 3660.94] shoulders.
[3661.30 → 3662.46] We learn from him, and we have
[3662.46 → 3663.96] fellowship with one another.
[3664.96 → 3667.92] We can persevere in this world by
[3667.92 → 3670.90] obeying Christ and resting in
[3670.90 → 3671.52] community.
[3672.16 → 3672.54] Rest.
[3673.10 → 3673.70] Obedience.
[3674.32 → 3674.68] Community.
[3676.60 → 3678.06] Those three words, they're so
[3678.06 → 3679.90] important for our faith, our
[3679.90 → 3681.64] faithful service to Jesus Christ.
[3681.84 → 3682.14] Rest.
[3682.46 → 3683.00] Obedience.
[3683.00 → 3683.44] Community.
[3683.88 → 3685.38] We've all heard sermons on these,
[3685.46 → 3685.62] right?
[3685.70 → 3686.70] This is not necessarily, these
[3686.70 → 3687.52] aren't new words.
[3688.24 → 3689.22] Some of you have done Bible
[3689.22 → 3689.72] studies.
[3690.36 → 3691.74] Some of these words have come up.
[3691.80 → 3692.62] You've been in church long
[3692.62 → 3692.86] enough.
[3692.94 → 3694.36] You've even probably just now
[3694.36 → 3695.84] possibly slouched in your chair a
[3695.84 → 3696.94] little bit and thought, oh, good.
[3697.26 → 3698.26] Another sermon on rest.
[3698.40 → 3699.50] Oh, yeah, no, community is
[3699.50 → 3699.80] important.
[3699.94 → 3700.84] Yeah, we should obey.
[3701.64 → 3702.98] And you're probably thinking to
[3702.98 → 3704.04] yourself, rolling your eyes a
[3704.04 → 3704.58] little bit, great.
[3704.70 → 3705.44] What are you going to talk about
[3705.44 → 3705.68] next?
[3705.80 → 3706.16] Tithing?
[3707.22 → 3708.64] Well, stay after the service for
[3708.64 → 3709.36] that talk.
[3711.12 → 3712.28] No, and next week.
[3712.40 → 3713.02] It's coming up.
[3715.10 → 3716.38] Sometimes we gloss over this
[3716.38 → 3717.48] because we think we hear this
[3717.48 → 3718.26] all the time.
[3718.46 → 3719.56] But the problem is that these
[3719.56 → 3721.38] three words, they combat some
[3721.38 → 3723.40] very serious idols in our
[3723.40 → 3725.06] culture that we hear all the
[3725.06 → 3726.02] time, and we don't even gloss
[3726.02 → 3727.26] over anymore because they've
[3727.26 → 3729.40] embedded themselves into our
[3729.40 → 3730.42] culture, into our churches.
[3731.08 → 3733.36] The idols of busyness and
[3733.36 → 3735.84] autonomy and individualism.
[3737.30 → 3738.32] Some of you might not even see
[3738.32 → 3739.50] these words as bad because
[3739.50 → 3740.70] that's how ingrained they are
[3740.70 → 3741.66] in our social systems.
[3742.00 → 3743.02] But these things, they run
[3743.02 → 3745.16] counter to Christ, and we need
[3745.16 → 3746.10] to be aware of them.
[3747.62 → 3749.44] So why are these idols so bad
[3749.44 → 3750.46] and how do we combat them?
[3750.46 → 3751.64] We're going to look at that for
[3751.64 → 3752.44] the rest of this message.
[3753.18 → 3754.96] Rest, obedience, and community
[3754.96 → 3757.34] combat each of these idols.
[3757.80 → 3759.06] Rest combats busyness.
[3759.82 → 3761.18] Obedience combats autonomy.
[3761.18 → 3763.02] And community combats
[3763.02 → 3763.82] individualism.
[3764.12 → 3765.16] And my hope is that as we
[3765.16 → 3766.14] leave here today, we will
[3766.14 → 3767.80] know that we can persevere in
[3767.80 → 3769.68] this world by obeying Christ
[3769.68 → 3771.90] and resting in community.
[3772.46 → 3773.50] So let's look at those three.
[3773.58 → 3775.26] Number one, rest combats
[3775.26 → 3776.16] busyness.
[3777.12 → 3777.82] Listen to this quote.
[3778.74 → 3782.28] In a 24-7, restless, work-addicted,
[3782.54 → 3784.14] anxious-presence culture,
[3785.32 → 3787.40] Sabbath is an act of resistance.
[3788.64 → 3789.04] Oof.
[3791.18 → 3793.88] In a 24-7, restless, work-addicted,
[3794.04 → 3795.30] anxious-presence culture,
[3795.48 → 3798.02] Sabbath is an act of resistance.
[3798.14 → 3799.40] This idea of a Sabbath day,
[3799.48 → 3800.56] a day of rest,
[3800.96 → 3802.64] which is still something
[3802.64 → 3804.10] that God calls us to today,
[3804.62 → 3806.50] this was and continues to be
[3806.50 → 3808.92] a unique calling
[3808.92 → 3810.54] for God's people.
[3810.88 → 3812.06] In Exodus 20, 8-10,
[3812.36 → 3813.54] God commands that his people
[3813.54 → 3814.64] remember the Sabbath day
[3814.64 → 3815.46] by keeping it holy.
[3815.82 → 3817.10] Six days you should labour
[3817.10 → 3817.86] and do all your work,
[3817.86 → 3818.80] but the seventh day
[3818.80 → 3820.26] is a Sabbath day
[3820.26 → 3821.62] unto the Lord your God.
[3821.68 → 3823.38] On it, you shall do no work,
[3823.78 → 3825.22] neither you nor your son or daughter,
[3825.30 → 3826.66] nor your male or female servant,
[3826.86 → 3827.70] nor your animals,
[3827.84 → 3828.60] nor any foreigner
[3828.60 → 3830.54] residing in your towns.
[3830.78 → 3832.40] This ran very counter
[3832.40 → 3833.20] to what the nations
[3833.20 → 3834.34] around them were doing.
[3835.34 → 3835.92] And then actually,
[3836.04 → 3837.08] Jesus comes along
[3837.08 → 3839.30] and he challenges
[3839.30 → 3840.34] the Jewish people
[3840.34 → 3842.12] who were trying their best
[3842.12 → 3843.28] to obey this commandment,
[3843.28 → 3844.54] and he challenges them
[3844.54 → 3845.96] to observe it well.
[3846.52 → 3847.82] See, Jesus was frustrated
[3847.82 → 3848.80] because they had turned it
[3848.80 → 3849.94] instead of a day of rest
[3849.94 → 3851.16] into a day of rules.
[3853.40 → 3854.68] And so in Mark 2,
[3854.74 → 3856.22] verses 23-28,
[3856.28 → 3857.42] feel free to leave that later,
[3857.52 → 3858.40] basically the Pharisees
[3858.40 → 3859.26] get mad at Jesus
[3859.26 → 3860.90] because him and his disciples
[3860.90 → 3861.80] are picking some grain
[3861.80 → 3862.56] on the Sabbath day
[3862.56 → 3863.86] and Jesus calls them out
[3863.86 → 3865.06] reminding them of a story
[3865.06 → 3865.88] about King David
[3865.88 → 3866.78] and he tells them
[3866.78 → 3867.52] that Sabbath day
[3867.52 → 3869.88] isn't a day to follow rules,
[3870.44 → 3871.40] it's a day of rest.
[3871.40 → 3872.18] And he says,
[3872.38 → 3874.40] the Sabbath was made for man,
[3874.76 → 3875.98] not man for the Sabbath.
[3876.88 → 3878.50] So the Son of Man is Lord,
[3879.00 → 3880.04] even of the Sabbath.
[3880.28 → 3881.66] This day of rest
[3881.66 → 3883.00] was made for man
[3883.00 → 3884.38] as a day to slow down
[3884.38 → 3886.16] and to be with God
[3886.16 → 3887.96] and be with his people.
[3889.58 → 3891.04] So the concept of rest
[3891.04 → 3891.66] runs deep,
[3891.70 → 3892.88] it runs right from the beginning
[3892.88 → 3893.70] of God's people.
[3896.04 → 3898.04] Sadly, the idea of Sabbath,
[3898.16 → 3899.08] it's kind of gone away
[3899.08 → 3900.10] in our culture, hasn't it?
[3900.10 → 3902.66] It wasn't even 20, 30 years ago
[3902.66 → 3903.98] many businesses were closed
[3903.98 → 3904.54] on Sunday
[3904.54 → 3905.08] and now it's hard
[3905.08 → 3906.06] to find one not open.
[3907.24 → 3907.88] There are events,
[3908.02 → 3908.96] extracurricular activities,
[3909.08 → 3909.70] sports, you name it.
[3909.74 → 3910.42] Sundays are not
[3910.42 → 3912.02] cultural days off anymore.
[3913.42 → 3915.00] But actually beyond Sabbath,
[3915.16 → 3915.80] if you're just talking
[3915.80 → 3916.44] about rest,
[3916.50 → 3917.64] even rest in general
[3917.64 → 3918.50] is frowned upon,
[3918.56 → 3918.88] isn't it?
[3922.38 → 3923.56] Busyness is praised.
[3924.70 → 3925.02] And in fact,
[3925.10 → 3925.94] busyness is now
[3925.94 → 3926.84] a mark of pride
[3926.84 → 3927.72] or a mark of success.
[3927.72 → 3928.62] This is what some
[3928.62 → 3930.46] of the most successful men
[3930.46 → 3932.18], and please don't,
[3932.78 → 3934.80] please notice the air quotes here.
[3934.88 → 3935.38] This is what some
[3935.38 → 3936.58] of the most successful men
[3936.58 → 3937.92] in our world boast about.
[3938.40 → 3939.98] Elon Musk boasts
[3939.98 → 3942.68] about working 80 to 100 hours a week.
[3943.04 → 3943.66] Jeff Bezos,
[3943.80 → 3944.56] the Amazon guy,
[3944.66 → 3945.94] he boasts of the same thing.
[3946.70 → 3947.40] Kevin O'Leary,
[3947.54 → 3948.54] the guy from Shark Tank,
[3948.60 → 3949.28] I think he owns a bunch
[3949.28 → 3949.92] of Boston pizzas
[3949.92 → 3951.00] and probably a billion other things.
[3951.36 → 3952.24] He said the following,
[3952.30 → 3952.82] listen to this quote,
[3953.14 → 3954.20] you want to be successful?
[3954.52 → 3955.80] Forget about work-life balance.
[3955.80 → 3958.08] You need to work 25 hours a day,
[3958.32 → 3959.52] seven days a week forever.
[3959.92 → 3960.74] That's what it takes.
[3961.68 → 3962.16] Oh, Kevin.
[3965.34 → 3966.60] If we want more proof,
[3967.10 → 3968.00] here's an easy one.
[3968.08 → 3968.92] Here's an easy example.
[3970.78 → 3972.32] What's the most common answer
[3972.32 → 3973.32] given to this question?
[3974.18 → 3974.78] How are you?
[3977.56 → 3977.96] Busy.
[3979.64 → 3980.52] Yeah, busy.
[3980.68 → 3981.16] How are you?
[3981.28 → 3981.70] Oh, busy.
[3982.80 → 3984.26] If someone ever said the opposite,
[3984.26 → 3985.12] wouldn't that be shocking?
[3985.80 → 3986.06] Right?
[3986.14 → 3986.72] Like if you came up,
[3986.88 → 3987.76] hey, Kevin, how are you?
[3987.90 → 3989.14] Oh, super relaxed, actually.
[3989.30 → 3990.06] No, not busy at all.
[3990.10 → 3990.64] Things are slow.
[3991.14 → 3991.56] Things are slow.
[3991.58 → 3992.64] I've been resting lots.
[3993.20 → 3994.68] Not a ton happening these days.
[3994.78 → 3995.96] I enjoyed both the sunrise
[3995.96 → 3996.70] and the sunset.
[3996.82 → 3997.54] Did you know it did both?
[3998.96 → 3999.82] Clouds roll in.
[3999.86 → 4001.04] I watched those this week.
[4001.08 → 4001.96] I even had time to read
[4001.96 → 4003.04] the Chronicles of Narnia.
[4003.30 → 4004.22] C.S. Lewis wrote that.
[4004.26 → 4004.74] Have you heard of him?
[4004.78 → 4005.44] I think he's a Christian.
[4006.78 → 4008.34] Like you'd be concerned, right?
[4008.88 → 4009.76] If that was my response.
[4009.80 → 4010.16] In fact,
[4010.38 → 4011.82] some of you might even be angry
[4011.82 → 4012.72] and you'd have to write
[4012.72 → 4013.62] counsel a letter being,
[4013.62 → 4014.82] what are you paying this guy for?
[4014.82 → 4016.04] He's not busy enough.
[4019.90 → 4021.82] Joke, but it's a mark of pride,
[4021.88 → 4022.32] isn't it?
[4025.08 → 4027.00] The problem with answering the question,
[4027.12 → 4028.32] how are you if I'm busy,
[4028.48 → 4030.26] is if you're busy all the time,
[4030.50 → 4031.88] if that's always your answer,
[4032.68 → 4034.38] busyness has to be relative
[4034.38 → 4035.16] to something.
[4036.22 → 4036.38] Right?
[4036.64 → 4037.82] Busyness has to be relative
[4037.82 → 4038.94] to your normal life.
[4038.94 → 4040.16] So the problem,
[4040.28 → 4041.44] if you're always busy,
[4042.16 → 4043.44] you're not busy.
[4044.20 → 4045.34] That's normal life.
[4046.02 → 4047.24] That's the life you're living.
[4048.40 → 4049.74] Perhaps we've made it that way.
[4049.84 → 4050.86] Perhaps you've made it that way.
[4050.94 → 4052.24] Perhaps that's been pushed upon you.
[4052.30 → 4052.68] But that's,
[4052.82 → 4053.40] you're not busy.
[4053.48 → 4054.08] That's normal.
[4055.90 → 4057.72] We answer the question that way
[4057.72 → 4060.02] because that's the expectation
[4060.02 → 4061.26] that we've put on each other.
[4061.26 → 4062.58] Because if you're not busy,
[4062.84 → 4063.94] you're lazy,
[4064.30 → 4065.08] or you're sluggish,
[4065.22 → 4066.30] or you're uninspiring.
[4067.32 → 4069.12] Again, being busy is a mark of pride,
[4069.92 → 4071.24] a mark of success,
[4072.18 → 4074.34] a mark of proper functioning
[4074.34 → 4075.14] in this world.
[4076.10 → 4076.98] Not being busy,
[4077.06 → 4077.56] that's a sin.
[4078.26 → 4079.14] If you're not busy,
[4079.70 → 4080.54] you should be doing more.
[4081.06 → 4081.66] Write those letters.
[4081.66 → 4085.70] See, we see the mark of busyness
[4085.70 → 4086.64] in the church, too.
[4086.74 → 4087.76] Church attendance isn't
[4087.76 → 4089.36] a priority anymore.
[4089.48 → 4090.66] Sports is taking president,
[4090.80 → 4091.56] amongst other things.
[4091.90 → 4093.00] We see it Sunday mornings.
[4093.18 → 4093.66] We see it in,
[4093.66 → 4094.60] I see it in youth ministry,
[4094.70 → 4095.06] for sure.
[4096.18 → 4097.54] We see it in other ministries.
[4097.62 → 4098.58] I know it's not just me.
[4099.06 → 4099.22] I know,
[4099.32 → 4100.44] I'm sure we've all noticed it.
[4101.54 → 4102.44] The reason I'm sure
[4102.44 → 4103.16] we've all felt it,
[4103.24 → 4103.88] the reason I'm sure
[4103.88 → 4104.68] we've all noticed it,
[4104.72 → 4105.88] is because we know deep down
[4105.88 → 4107.56] it's true for almost all of us.
[4108.94 → 4109.38] Busy.
[4109.38 → 4113.68] I think the reason
[4113.68 → 4114.42] we know it's true
[4114.42 → 4115.36] is because God
[4115.36 → 4116.66] doesn't desire
[4116.66 → 4118.08] us to be busy.
[4119.18 → 4120.54] God desires us
[4120.54 → 4121.40] to be faithful.
[4123.18 → 4124.54] He intends for us
[4124.54 → 4125.82] to find rest in Him.
[4127.66 → 4128.76] He intends for us
[4128.76 → 4130.14] to find rest in His work.
[4131.98 → 4133.76] Our busyness needs to shift
[4133.76 → 4134.98] and be God-oriented,
[4135.18 → 4136.16] others-oriented.
[4136.38 → 4137.76] If we're answering the question,
[4137.88 → 4138.38] how are you,
[4138.38 → 4139.54] with busy all the time?
[4139.96 → 4141.32] We need to turn to God
[4141.32 → 4142.56] and find our rest in Him.
[4143.14 → 4144.24] We need to fill our schedules
[4144.24 → 4145.32] with His work.
[4145.58 → 4147.42] We need to put on His yoke
[4147.42 → 4148.06] on our shoulders
[4148.06 → 4149.12] and find God's voice
[4149.12 → 4150.54] in His Word.
[4151.68 → 4153.40] We need to learn from Christ.
[4153.66 → 4154.46] Slow down.
[4155.18 → 4156.36] Practice Sabbath rest.
[4157.40 → 4159.06] Don't let the idol of busyness
[4159.06 → 4160.04] run our lives anymore.
[4160.14 → 4162.66] Let's obey the Saviour
[4162.66 → 4165.08] and find our rest in Him.
[4165.08 → 4167.08] Obey.
[4167.22 → 4167.66] Obedience.
[4167.74 → 4168.26] There's your segue.
[4168.42 → 4168.82] Number two,
[4169.14 → 4171.54] obedience counters autonomy.
[4173.04 → 4174.10] Autonomy is the idea
[4174.10 → 4175.24] of self-government,
[4175.36 → 4177.16] that we can govern ourselves
[4177.16 → 4178.72] as individuals
[4178.72 → 4180.24] based on a set of morals.
[4180.40 → 4181.74] It's very, very popular
[4181.74 → 4182.78] in our culture right now.
[4182.82 → 4184.98] This is only gaining ground
[4184.98 → 4185.46] as well.
[4185.54 → 4186.02] But the problem is
[4186.02 → 4186.70] those morals,
[4187.18 → 4188.70] the goalposts keep shifting.
[4188.84 → 4189.46] And so it's becoming
[4189.46 → 4190.30] pretty tricky
[4190.30 → 4191.98] to be able to practice
[4191.98 → 4193.18] self-government.
[4194.34 → 4195.50] Autonomy can simply
[4195.50 → 4196.70] be summed up in two phrases.
[4196.92 → 4197.80] And I think you've probably
[4197.80 → 4198.68] all heard both of them.
[4199.10 → 4199.56] First one,
[4199.60 → 4200.68] as long as you're not hurting anyone,
[4201.02 → 4201.72] do whatever you want.
[4202.86 → 4203.28] It's autonomy.
[4203.64 → 4204.38] If you haven't heard of that one,
[4204.42 → 4204.80] you've probably heard
[4204.80 → 4205.34] of this next one.
[4205.38 → 4205.86] It's even shorter.
[4206.26 → 4206.94] You do you.
[4208.08 → 4208.22] Right?
[4208.98 → 4209.70] That's autonomy.
[4211.42 → 4212.10] That's autonomy.
[4212.88 → 4214.24] We can govern ourselves.
[4215.68 → 4216.26] Until then,
[4216.32 → 4218.46] so submitting to obedience,
[4218.68 → 4220.24] especially to some God,
[4220.24 → 4221.84] that's not only useless
[4221.84 → 4222.64] in our culture,
[4222.76 → 4223.94] it makes us intolerant
[4223.94 → 4224.66] or narrow-minded.
[4225.50 → 4226.34] That's what the world
[4226.34 → 4227.28] is telling us anyway.
[4228.36 → 4228.82] See, autonomy,
[4228.98 → 4230.28] it seeks self-love.
[4230.36 → 4231.46] What makes you happy?
[4231.74 → 4232.92] What makes you feel
[4232.92 → 4233.40] like yourself?
[4233.56 → 4234.52] What philosophies
[4234.52 → 4236.58] do you root your identity in?
[4236.64 → 4237.74] What rights exists
[4237.74 → 4240.40] for you to function the best?
[4240.52 → 4242.12] We pick and choose then.
[4242.22 → 4242.82] We get to.
[4242.92 → 4244.08] We get to pick and choose
[4244.08 → 4245.50] what side of hot-button issues
[4245.50 → 4246.78] we land on
[4246.78 → 4248.20] and then our self-governing selves
[4248.20 → 4249.00] can take over.
[4249.00 → 4250.62] We get to dig our heels
[4250.62 → 4251.62] in where we want to.
[4252.38 → 4253.46] We identify then
[4253.46 → 4254.96] with different belief systems,
[4255.08 → 4256.26] not necessarily realizing
[4256.26 → 4257.88] that identity ideas
[4257.88 → 4258.64] become idols
[4258.64 → 4260.60] as soon as we stop identifying
[4260.60 → 4262.26] with being one of God's children,
[4262.52 → 4263.08] as soon as we try
[4263.08 → 4264.42] to discover our identities
[4264.42 → 4265.32] instead of receive
[4265.32 → 4267.02] our identities in Christ.
[4267.26 → 4268.20] And no matter the issue,
[4269.08 → 4271.94] what happens with autonomy
[4271.94 → 4274.52] is that autonomy leads
[4274.52 → 4275.40] to echo chambers.
[4275.40 → 4278.70] like thinking leads
[4278.70 → 4280.58] to people who think like you.
[4281.52 → 4282.76] And soon all people here
[4282.76 → 4283.72] are the same voices
[4283.72 → 4284.70] all the time
[4284.70 → 4285.56] on the same issues.
[4286.56 → 4287.66] They hang out together,
[4287.74 → 4288.62] they chat together,
[4289.18 → 4290.94] they move away from anyone
[4290.94 → 4291.80] who thinks differently,
[4292.02 → 4293.42] and this drives people
[4293.42 → 4294.30] deeper and deeper
[4294.30 → 4296.58] into their own autonomous beliefs
[4296.58 → 4297.52] and pushes people
[4297.52 → 4298.26] who believe differently
[4298.26 → 4299.64] the other direction.
[4299.64 → 4302.04] And so we read articles
[4302.04 → 4302.66] or books
[4302.66 → 4303.72] or watch videos,
[4303.84 → 4305.16] most likely with little
[4305.16 → 4306.16] or no objectivity.
[4306.42 → 4309.10] We come across things online
[4309.10 → 4311.28] in our algorithm-manipulated news feed,
[4311.38 → 4312.68] something that already jives
[4312.68 → 4314.84] with our implicit preconceptions
[4314.84 → 4316.76] and serves our confirmation biases.
[4316.98 → 4318.60] And then we subconsciously apply
[4318.60 → 4320.28] our own emotional filters
[4320.28 → 4321.90] and proclaim it as truth
[4321.90 → 4323.86] because that's what we've believed
[4323.86 → 4324.96] all along.
[4325.10 → 4326.38] That's what we already thought,
[4326.44 → 4327.22] and that's the truth
[4327.22 → 4328.14] that we've taught ourselves.
[4328.14 → 4331.48] And we do it in church too.
[4332.82 → 4333.98] For many of us,
[4334.28 → 4335.36] and here's a risky comment,
[4336.72 → 4338.34] a sermon is only a good sermon
[4338.34 → 4339.98] if what the pastor said
[4339.98 → 4341.50] aligned with what we already believed.
[4342.96 → 4343.76] That's autonomy.
[4345.60 → 4346.60] And self-government
[4346.60 → 4347.38] done in a world
[4347.38 → 4349.02] without gatekeeping of information,
[4349.96 → 4351.06] it's led to these pockets
[4351.06 → 4352.70] of autonomous thinkers
[4352.70 → 4354.24] where we're all philosophers
[4354.24 → 4355.46] of our own self-love,
[4355.56 → 4356.86] our own understanding of this world,
[4356.86 → 4358.30] and our own happiness within it,
[4359.20 → 4360.32] and without actually thinking,
[4360.44 → 4362.42] people silo themselves from others.
[4362.70 → 4363.96] We don't even do it on purpose,
[4364.12 → 4364.70] sadly, anymore.
[4365.02 → 4365.76] We are all victims
[4365.76 → 4367.10] of trying to find our own truths
[4367.10 → 4368.24] in a world with algorithms
[4368.24 → 4369.38] and echo chambers.
[4369.50 → 4370.28] But here's the problem.
[4370.70 → 4373.04] God doesn't challenge us
[4373.04 → 4374.24] to find our own truths.
[4375.54 → 4376.54] God doesn't tell us
[4376.54 → 4377.56] to root our identities
[4377.56 → 4379.02] in the ideas of this world.
[4380.08 → 4381.22] God doesn't want us
[4381.22 → 4381.86] to contribute
[4381.86 → 4382.96] to the echo chambers
[4382.96 → 4384.50] that we find ourselves in.
[4384.72 → 4385.72] God doesn't like
[4385.72 → 4386.90] his people siloed.
[4387.98 → 4389.12] God doesn't call us
[4389.12 → 4390.00] to self-love.
[4391.12 → 4392.08] He calls us
[4392.08 → 4393.30] to selfless love.
[4394.40 → 4396.00] Love calls us
[4396.00 → 4396.62] to obedience.
[4397.62 → 4398.40] God's love
[4398.40 → 4399.02] calls us
[4399.02 → 4399.62] to obedience.
[4401.32 → 4402.08] We're called
[4402.08 → 4403.04] to obedience in him,
[4403.12 → 4403.58] not ourselves,
[4403.70 → 4405.20] not our own self-government.
[4405.20 → 4407.26] We can't take God's word
[4407.26 → 4408.76] and then try to spin it
[4408.76 → 4409.32] to fit it
[4409.32 → 4410.58] into our own worldviews
[4410.58 → 4412.16] or fit it into our silos.
[4412.48 → 4413.96] We have to take his word
[4413.96 → 4414.98] and obey it.
[4415.80 → 4416.54] Live it out.
[4417.36 → 4418.42] Even if it's hard.
[4421.12 → 4422.32] Because no matter what,
[4423.40 → 4424.60] if we're following God's word,
[4424.66 → 4426.06] if we obey God's word,
[4426.56 → 4428.38] we are all inevitably
[4428.38 → 4429.48] going to be pushing back
[4429.48 → 4430.50] against an echo chamber
[4430.50 → 4431.90] that we find ourselves in today.
[4432.98 → 4434.22] Maybe that echo chamber
[4434.22 → 4435.94] has to do with human freedoms
[4435.94 → 4436.96] or government control.
[4437.04 → 4437.80] Maybe that echo chamber
[4437.80 → 4438.38] has to do with
[4438.38 → 4439.54] human sexuality
[4439.54 → 4440.08] or identity.
[4440.26 → 4441.60] Maybe that echo chamber
[4441.60 → 4442.50] has to do with capitalism
[4442.50 → 4443.34] or socialism
[4443.34 → 4444.46] or pick another-ism.
[4445.62 → 4446.62] But at some point,
[4446.70 → 4448.10] obeying God's word
[4448.10 → 4449.82] is going to cause you
[4449.82 → 4450.48] to brush up
[4450.48 → 4451.40] against one of these
[4451.40 → 4452.58] human-made constructs
[4452.58 → 4452.92] or ideas
[4452.92 → 4454.74] that make comfortable
[4454.74 → 4456.18] echo chamber you
[4456.18 → 4456.88] find yourself
[4456.88 → 4459.06] in a very awkward situation.
[4461.06 → 4461.98] But we're not supposed
[4461.98 → 4462.88] to be living in silos.
[4462.88 → 4464.02] We're supposed to be living
[4464.02 → 4465.08] as the body of Christ.
[4465.38 → 4466.04] That's our calling.
[4466.12 → 4467.26] We're not called to autonomy.
[4467.40 → 4468.20] We're called to obedience.
[4468.46 → 4469.42] We're called to community.
[4470.10 → 4472.26] Obedience conquers autonomy
[4472.26 → 4474.78] and pushes us to community,
[4474.90 → 4475.66] which is the third thing.
[4475.74 → 4478.34] Community conquers individualism.
[4479.42 → 4480.28] Here's another quote.
[4481.46 → 4483.20] In a hyper-individualistic,
[4483.32 → 4484.82] anonymous, self-love,
[4484.96 → 4486.28] you-do-you culture,
[4486.92 → 4489.10] community is an act of resistance.
[4489.10 → 4490.96] Another oof.
[4492.78 → 4494.00] See, not only is community
[4494.00 → 4495.78] a resistance to individualism,
[4495.86 → 4497.36] but if we're called to obey,
[4498.10 → 4498.68] and we are,
[4499.60 → 4501.06] community will be a response
[4501.06 → 4501.92] to that obedience.
[4503.36 → 4504.16] Again, if you look at our
[4504.16 → 4505.34] first John text, for example,
[4506.02 → 4508.44] I've added some emphasis here.
[4508.78 → 4509.50] This is the message
[4509.50 → 4511.02] we have heard from him
[4511.02 → 4511.82] and declare to you.
[4512.16 → 4512.72] God is light.
[4512.80 → 4514.16] In him there is no darkness at all.
[4514.16 → 4516.84] If we claim to have fellowship with him
[4516.84 → 4518.80] and yet walk in darkness,
[4519.20 → 4521.54] we lie and do not live out the truth.
[4521.62 → 4523.22] But if we walk in the light
[4523.22 → 4524.36] as he is in the light,
[4524.68 → 4526.30] we will have fellowship
[4526.30 → 4527.50] with one another.
[4528.38 → 4529.36] And the blood of Jesus,
[4529.64 → 4531.34] his son, purifies us
[4531.34 → 4533.36] from all sin.
[4533.96 → 4536.46] Hebrews is even more blunt.
[4536.74 → 4538.78] Hebrews 10, 23 to 24,
[4538.86 → 4539.20] says this,
[4539.30 → 4541.20] Let us hold unswervingly
[4541.20 → 4542.34] to the hope we profess.
[4542.34 → 4544.12] For he who promised is faithful.
[4544.46 → 4545.60] And let us consider
[4545.60 → 4547.96] how we may spur one another on
[4547.96 → 4549.12] toward love and good deeds,
[4549.62 → 4551.54] not giving up meeting one another
[4551.54 → 4553.08] as some in the habit are doing,
[4553.46 → 4554.94] but encouraging one another.
[4555.62 → 4556.62] And all the more
[4556.62 → 4557.68] as you see the day approaching.
[4557.86 → 4558.66] If we obey,
[4558.92 → 4560.28] we will live in this community.
[4560.40 → 4561.22] We will find rest,
[4561.24 → 4562.54] as we discussed earlier,
[4562.64 → 4564.14] in this community.
[4567.14 → 4568.20] But we can be guilty
[4568.20 → 4569.26] of taking the
[4569.26 → 4570.70] out of community a little bit too.
[4570.70 → 4571.92] I find this church
[4571.92 → 4573.00] gets the community thing.
[4573.08 → 4573.66] I think we are
[4573.66 → 4574.68] a tight-knit community.
[4574.84 → 4576.00] We are a welcoming community.
[4576.50 → 4576.98] And yet,
[4577.06 → 4577.74] there are moments
[4577.74 → 4579.40] when we take the out
[4579.40 → 4580.22] sometimes.
[4581.00 → 4581.54] Isn't there?
[4581.56 → 4582.30] We say things like,
[4582.70 → 4584.00] I don't really like that song.
[4584.56 → 4584.78] Or,
[4584.98 → 4585.86] that sermon really didn't
[4585.86 → 4586.82] do anything for me.
[4587.68 → 4587.90] Or,
[4587.96 → 4588.76] I'm not going to go
[4588.76 → 4589.34] to that ministry
[4589.34 → 4591.74] because I'm not getting
[4591.74 → 4592.56] anything out of it.
[4593.90 → 4595.02] But what happens is,
[4595.08 → 4596.02] we forget that some people
[4596.02 → 4596.94] really love that song.
[4596.94 → 4598.98] And it touches their heart
[4598.98 → 4600.36] in a way we won't understand
[4600.36 → 4601.68] until we stop complaining
[4601.68 → 4603.10] and we ask them about it.
[4604.16 → 4604.56] Or,
[4604.62 → 4606.06] that sermon really encouraged
[4606.06 → 4607.12] or convicted someone else,
[4607.20 → 4608.76] but our sour attitude towards it
[4608.76 → 4609.56] means they aren't going
[4609.56 → 4610.50] to tell you why.
[4612.00 → 4612.18] Or,
[4612.22 → 4613.14] that ministry that you
[4613.14 → 4614.64] don't get anything out of
[4614.64 → 4616.52] isn't about you
[4616.52 → 4617.62] getting something out of it.
[4617.68 → 4618.62] It might be about you
[4618.62 → 4619.68] giving something to it.
[4620.12 → 4621.62] And the body who gathers there
[4621.62 → 4622.58] is missing you.
[4622.58 → 4626.24] Individualism gets in the way
[4626.24 → 4626.94] of community.
[4627.82 → 4628.82] But if we stop asking
[4628.82 → 4631.08] what is church doing for me
[4631.08 → 4631.86] and start asking
[4631.86 → 4633.40] what can I do for the church?
[4633.48 → 4634.28] What can I do
[4634.28 → 4635.98] for my brothers and sisters?
[4636.06 → 4636.66] Now we're talking.
[4637.40 → 4638.22] We start being there
[4638.22 → 4638.78] for each other.
[4638.88 → 4639.88] We start sharing the load.
[4640.12 → 4641.50] We start accomplishing more
[4641.50 → 4642.84] as a family.
[4642.96 → 4643.94] We start rejoicing
[4643.94 → 4644.68] with each other
[4644.68 → 4645.90] when we rejoice.
[4646.06 → 4646.80] We start mourning
[4646.80 → 4647.42] with each other
[4647.42 → 4648.22] when we mourn
[4648.22 → 4649.64] and grieving with each other
[4649.64 → 4650.42] when we grieve.
[4650.42 → 4653.42] And that switch in mentality,
[4653.64 → 4654.78] it runs counter
[4654.78 → 4656.70] to the individualism
[4656.70 → 4657.40] that we live in.
[4657.54 → 4659.06] We can stop thinking
[4659.06 → 4659.92] of our own happiness
[4659.92 → 4660.90] or our own identities
[4660.90 → 4661.84] or our own preferences
[4661.84 → 4663.06] because we start thinking
[4663.06 → 4664.08] of our brothers and sisters
[4664.08 → 4665.02] and that brings us
[4665.02 → 4666.34] joy and happiness.
[4668.92 → 4669.88] We start thinking
[4669.88 → 4670.90] of those around us,
[4671.16 → 4672.46] of the poor and the needy,
[4673.18 → 4674.36] of the widow and the orphan,
[4674.50 → 4674.98] the mourning,
[4675.32 → 4675.80] the grieving,
[4676.00 → 4676.80] the least of these.
[4677.96 → 4678.88] And that becomes
[4678.88 → 4679.92] a lot less selfish.
[4680.42 → 4681.40] And our relationships
[4681.40 → 4682.56] become a lot more
[4682.56 → 4683.60] robust and full.
[4686.60 → 4687.72] We're going to land here.
[4688.50 → 4689.78] But the beauty is
[4689.78 → 4691.18] that we can only be
[4691.18 → 4692.24] in this true community
[4692.24 → 4693.16] because of Jesus.
[4694.66 → 4695.50] Dietrich Bonhoeffer
[4695.50 → 4696.98] sums it up brilliantly.
[4697.28 → 4698.18] And so I'm just going to read him
[4698.18 → 4698.82] because he's way smarter
[4698.82 → 4699.28] than I am.
[4699.78 → 4700.72] He says this in his book
[4700.72 → 4701.26] Life Together.
[4702.26 → 4703.16] Without Christ,
[4703.16 → 4704.54] we also would not know
[4704.54 → 4705.68] our brother or sister,
[4705.94 → 4707.24] nor could we come to them.
[4707.72 → 4708.56] The way is blocked
[4708.56 → 4710.08] by our own ego.
[4711.42 → 4711.94] Individualism.
[4713.20 → 4714.28] Christ opened up the way
[4714.28 → 4715.40] to God and to our brother
[4715.40 → 4715.88] and sister.
[4716.22 → 4717.22] Now Christians can live
[4717.22 → 4718.22] with one another in peace.
[4718.50 → 4719.46] They can love and serve
[4719.46 → 4719.82] one another.
[4719.92 → 4721.34] They can become one.
[4721.54 → 4722.52] But they can continue
[4722.52 → 4723.52] to do so only
[4723.52 → 4725.22] by the way of Jesus Christ.
[4725.44 → 4726.68] Only in Jesus Christ
[4726.68 → 4727.54] are we one.
[4727.92 → 4728.84] Only through him
[4728.84 → 4730.04] are we bound together.
[4730.80 → 4731.54] To eternity,
[4731.76 → 4732.58] he remains
[4732.58 → 4734.14] the one mediator.
[4734.14 → 4736.50] That's the community
[4736.50 → 4738.36] that conquers individualism.
[4739.44 → 4740.58] And so Christ's gospel truth,
[4740.82 → 4741.56] his life, death,
[4741.62 → 4742.08] and resurrection
[4742.08 → 4742.80] from the tomb,
[4743.28 → 4744.54] defeating sin and misery
[4744.54 → 4745.36] and paving the way
[4745.36 → 4746.28] for eternity with him
[4746.28 → 4746.96] for all believers,
[4747.14 → 4748.28] that gives us
[4748.28 → 4749.02] eternal rest.
[4750.50 → 4751.64] So go and take his yoke.
[4752.74 → 4753.32] Rest in him
[4753.32 → 4754.32] by working for him.
[4754.40 → 4755.38] Unplug from this world
[4755.38 → 4756.50] and know him more.
[4756.62 → 4757.72] Read his word.
[4758.48 → 4759.94] Invite him into your life
[4759.94 → 4760.84] each and every day.
[4762.94 → 4764.28] That's our call to obedience.
[4764.72 → 4765.52] To live for him
[4765.52 → 4767.14] and then live for each other.
[4767.94 → 4768.72] So be in community.
[4768.86 → 4769.92] Meet together regularly.
[4770.40 → 4771.84] Here on Sundays for sure, yes.
[4772.04 → 4773.36] But outside of Sundays too,
[4773.46 → 4775.28] share meals with one another.
[4776.06 → 4776.76] Commune together.
[4776.92 → 4778.00] Learn about each other.
[4778.84 → 4779.74] Encourage one another.
[4779.88 → 4781.32] Find ways to add
[4781.32 → 4782.22] your brothers and sisters
[4782.22 → 4784.64] into your regular rhythms of life.
[4784.70 → 4786.66] And let's all find new ways
[4786.66 → 4788.46] to rest in God's family.
[4788.64 → 4788.84] Amen?
[4789.72 → 4790.38] Let me pray.
[4792.72 → 4793.52] Father in heaven,
[4794.64 → 4797.72] life can be overwhelming sometimes.
[4798.46 → 4799.78] In the midst of the busyness
[4799.78 → 4800.30] of the world,
[4800.38 → 4801.68] the joys, the sorrows, Lord,
[4802.22 → 4803.32] we can forget about you
[4803.32 → 4804.70] and we can forget about your work
[4804.70 → 4805.62] that you call us to.
[4806.62 → 4807.58] Lord, stir in our hearts.
[4807.72 → 4809.40] Find us ways to rest in you.
[4810.18 → 4811.40] Allow us to dig into your word,
[4811.46 → 4812.62] to pray, to meditate.
[4812.62 → 4816.44] Allow us to obey
[4816.44 → 4817.54] what you call us to do.
[4818.74 → 4820.20] And Lord, let us rest in community.
[4820.44 → 4821.64] You call us to this community.
[4821.76 → 4822.90] May we be there for one another.
[4823.96 → 4824.88] May we push back
[4824.88 → 4826.48] against what culture pushes on us.
[4827.12 → 4828.04] Things like autonomy,
[4828.68 → 4829.52] individualism, God.
[4829.56 → 4830.86] And may we know
[4830.86 → 4832.28] that our calling is to obey you
[4832.28 → 4834.06] and be there for one another.
[4834.22 → 4835.02] May we do that
[4835.02 → 4836.70] willingly and lovingly, God.
[4837.30 → 4838.28] May you encourage us
[4838.28 → 4839.54] in the ways we are doing that well.
[4840.34 → 4841.22] May you convict us
[4841.22 → 4841.68] in the ways
[4841.68 → 4842.76] that we need to be convicted.
[4843.68 → 4844.62] And above all, God,
[4844.66 → 4845.68] may you be glorified
[4845.68 → 4847.64] as we go about these holy habits.
[4847.80 → 4848.56] In your name, amen.
[4848.56 → 4848.66] Amen.
[4848.66 → 4852.62] Amen.
[4854.90 → 4855.30] Amen.
[4857.38 → 4857.98] Amen.
[4857.98 → 4858.22] Amen.
[4858.46 → 4858.50] Amen.
[4859.00 → 4859.34] Amen.
[4859.34 → 4859.66] Amen.
[4861.96 → 4862.68] Amen.
[4862.68 → 4864.82] Amen.
[4872.76 → 4873.72] Amen.
[4873.72 → 4874.32] Amen.
[4874.34 → 4876.30] Amen.
[4876.30 → 4876.88] Amen.
[4876.88 → 4877.14] Amen.
[4877.80 → 4878.64] Amen.
[4878.64 → 4892.14] Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him
[4892.14 → 4899.40] How I've moved Him all in all
[4899.40 → 4907.22] Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus
[4907.22 → 4914.98] Hopeful grace to trust Him all
[4914.98 → 4923.46] It is so sweet to trust in Jesus
[4923.46 → 4931.20] Just to take Him at His word
[4931.20 → 4938.96] Just to rest upon His fullness
[4938.96 → 4944.96] Just to know the Saviour
[4944.96 → 4953.92] Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him
[4953.92 → 4960.72] How I've moved Him all in all
[4960.72 → 4968.48] Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus
[4968.48 → 4976.48] Hopeful grace to trust Him all
[4976.48 → 4986.24] Oh, how sweet to trust in Jesus
[4986.24 → 4994.24] Just to trust His cleansing blood
[4994.24 → 5002.00] Just in sin, the faith to conjure
[5002.00 → 5009.76] Before He'll be cleansing blood
[5009.76 → 5017.52] Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him
[5017.52 → 5023.52] How I trust Him all in all
[5023.52 → 5031.28] Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus
[5031.28 → 5041.04] Oh, how I trust Him all
[5041.04 → 5048.80] Just in sin, the faith to trust in Jesus
[5048.80 → 5056.44] Just from sin and self to cease
[5056.44 → 5062.80] Just from Jesus in the day
[5062.80 → 5072.56] Life and rest and joy and peace
[5072.56 → 5076.56] Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him
[5076.56 → 5080.56] How I trust Him all in all
[5080.56 → 5086.32] I'm so glad I've learned to trust in Jesus
[5086.32 → 5091.32] Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus
[5091.32 → 5093.06] Oh, how I trust Him all in all
[5093.06 → 5093.46] Precious Jesus, I found to trust in Jesus
[5093.46 → 5095.90] Precious Jesus, In your prayer
[5095.90 → 5096.68] I'm so glad I've learned to trust in Jesus
[5096.68 → 5101.32] Precious Jesus, Jesus, in your prayer
[5101.36 → 5111.52] I'm so glad I've learned to trust in Jesus
[5111.52 → 5119.58] Precious Jesus, in your prayer
[5119.58 → 5134.28] And I know that Thou art with me, will be with me to the end.
[5134.28 → 5149.46] Jesus, Jesus, now I trust Him, now I trust Him, before and all.
[5149.58 → 5166.40] Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus, look for praise to trust Him all.
[5170.26 → 5175.34] In a moment we're going to sing a closing song, and before that I'm going to read the priestly blessing in number 6.
[5175.34 → 5180.32] but I just have been asked and think it's wise to remind all of you that we have a congregational meeting
[5180.32 → 5181.78] following those two events.
[5181.92 → 5184.18] And, so please do, if you're a member here, stick around.
[5184.36 → 5186.36] If you're not a member here, you're welcome to stick around too.
[5186.42 → 5187.36] This is not a closed meeting.
[5187.70 → 5188.48] Learn how we tick.
[5188.78 → 5189.60] Do all that sorts of things.
[5189.70 → 5193.44] If you do need to go, there is enough time for you to sneak out into foyer, grab a coffee.
[5193.50 → 5194.08] That'll be served.
[5194.40 → 5197.70] And then our meeting, which hopefully is timed in minutes, not hours,
[5198.22 → 5200.14] we can have coffee as well afterwards.
[5200.24 → 5200.78] It should be quick.
[5200.82 → 5201.68] It will not be hours.
[5201.92 → 5205.32] So, yeah, join us for that or go have coffee.
[5206.26 → 5210.48] But right now, please receive this priestly blessing found in Numbers 6.
[5211.58 → 5213.60] The Lord bless you and keep you.
[5214.20 → 5217.68] The Lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[5218.28 → 5223.00] The Lord turn his face toward you and give you his peace.
[5223.46 → 5224.56] And all God's people said.
[5235.34 → 5249.54] May the peace of God, our heavenly Father, and the grace of Christ, the risen Son,
[5249.54 → 5265.26] And the fellowship of God, our heavenly Father, and the grace of Christ, the risen Son,
[5265.26 → 5285.96] And the fellowship of God, our heavenly Father, and the grace of God, and the grace of God.
[5285.96 → 5305.96] From the just of love to the hearts of God, we declare the King of the Lamb was slain, Christ eternal, the King, the King.
[5305.96 → 5335.94] In this peace which passes understanding, and this grace which makes us what we are, and this fellowship of His communion, make us one in spirit and in heart.
[5335.96 → 5362.96] And to Him, He prays for His glory and strength, from the just of love to the hearts of God, we declare the King of the Lamb on the lam was slain, Christ eternal, the King, the King.
[5362.96 → 5392.96] And to Him, He prays for His glorious reign, from the just of love to the heights of earth, we declare the name of the Lamb once slain,
[5392.96 → 5394.96] the King.
[5394.96 → 5424.94] And to Him, He prays for His glory and strength, from the just of love to the Christ of God, we declare the King of the Lamb, who we are, and this is the Lord of the Lamb, and this is the Lord of the Lamb.
[5424.96 → 5430.46] You're welcome to do so. The rest of our members, we appreciate it if you would stick around.
