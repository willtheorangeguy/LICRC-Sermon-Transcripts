[0.00 --> 11.04]  With you God, in all things, in all ways, walk humbly with you God.
[11.78 --> 16.10]  It's beauty for ashes, it's morning to dancing.
[16.54 --> 20.84]  It's closer and closer, the kingdom of heaven.
[21.40 --> 25.46]  Beauty for ashes, it's morning to dancing.
[30.00 --> 38.80]  I just see your mercy, walk humbly with you God.
[38.80 --> 48.14]  In all things, in all ways, walk humbly with you God.
[60.00 --> 64.80]  I need you.
[68.80 --> 69.80]  I need you.
[69.80 --> 74.80]  I need you.
[74.80 --> 76.96]  I'm begging please again.
[77.18 --> 78.40]  I need you.
[79.68 --> 81.80]  Oh, I need you.
[83.60 --> 87.00]  Walking down this desert road.
[87.50 --> 90.20]  Water for my thirsty soul.
[90.28 --> 91.54]  I need you.
[92.86 --> 94.90]  Oh, I need you.
[94.90 --> 105.08]  Your forgiveness is like sweet, sweet honey on my lips.
[105.70 --> 111.20]  Like the sound of a symphony to my ears.
[112.36 --> 117.92]  Like holy water on my skin.
[117.92 --> 120.12]  Hey!
[120.12 --> 132.92]  Dead man walking, slave to sin.
[132.92 --> 136.12]  I want to know about being born again.
[136.28 --> 137.62]  I need you.
[138.46 --> 140.92]  Oh, God, I need you.
[140.92 --> 146.18]  So take me to the riverside.
[146.18 --> 150.82]  Take me under bath, because I need you.
[151.60 --> 154.30]  Oh, God, I need you.
[155.22 --> 163.72]  Your forgiveness is like sweet, sweet honey on my lips.
[163.72 --> 170.34]  Like the sound of a symphony to my ears.
[172.16 --> 177.24]  Like holy water on my skin.
[181.76 --> 183.84]  On my skin.
[183.84 --> 192.14]  I don't want to abuse your grace
[192.14 --> 195.08]  God, I need it every day
[195.08 --> 201.48]  It's the only thing that ever really makes me want to change
[201.48 --> 205.28]  I don't want to abuse your grace
[205.28 --> 208.20]  God, I need it every day
[208.20 --> 214.76]  It's the only thing that ever really makes me want to change
[214.76 --> 218.40]  I don't want to abuse your grace
[218.40 --> 221.38]  God, I need it every day
[221.38 --> 227.34]  It's the only thing that ever really makes me want to change
[227.34 --> 231.60]  I don't want to abuse your grace
[231.60 --> 234.52]  God, I need it every day
[234.52 --> 240.76]  It's the only thing that ever really makes me want to change
[240.76 --> 242.52]  Your forgiveness
[242.52 --> 249.64]  It's like sweet, sweet honey on my lips
[249.64 --> 255.98]  Like the sound of a symphony to my ears
[255.98 --> 260.66]  It's that holy water
[260.66 --> 266.66]  There's like holy water on my skin
[266.66 --> 270.66]  There's like holy water on my skin
[270.66 --> 274.66]  There's like holy water on my skin
[274.66 --> 280.66]  Oh, it's like holy water
[280.66 --> 284.66]  There's like holy water on my skin
[284.66 --> 288.66]  There's like holy water on my skin
[288.66 --> 292.66]  Oh, it's like holy water
[292.66 --> 298.66]  Oh, it's like holy water on my skin
[298.66 --> 300.66]  And that's like holy water on my skin
[300.66 --> 302.90]  Oh, it's like holy water on my skin
[302.90 --> 332.88]  Thank you.
[332.90 --> 362.88]  Thank you.
[362.90 --> 364.90]  Thank you.
[392.90 --> 394.90]  Thank you.
[422.90 --> 424.90]  Thank you.
[424.90 --> 426.90]  Thank you.
[426.90 --> 432.90]  Thank you.
[432.90 --> 434.90]  Thank you.
[434.90 --> 436.90]  Thank you.
[436.90 --> 446.90]  Thank you.
[446.90 --> 448.90]  Thank you.
[448.90 --> 450.90]  Thank you.
[450.90 --> 452.90]  Thank you.
[452.90 --> 454.90]  Good morning.
[454.90 --> 456.90]  Oh, I heard some from the back there.
[456.90 --> 458.90]  Thanks, Linda.
[458.90 --> 460.90]  Welcome to worship.
[460.90 --> 466.90]  We are really excited to gather together on this blisteringly hot summer day.
[466.90 --> 467.90]  Oh, wait.
[467.90 --> 469.90]  What happened?
[469.90 --> 471.90]  It was beautiful just earlier this week.
[471.90 --> 474.90]  Anyway, we're really excited to gather for worship today.
[474.90 --> 475.90]  My name is Chris.
[475.90 --> 483.90]  I'm one of the pastors here and it's my privilege along with a couple others to lead in worship this morning.
[483.90 --> 490.90]  As you look around, you might realize that the average age of our worship this morning has skyrocketed.
[490.90 --> 493.90]  And that's because it's youth camp weekend.
[493.90 --> 500.90]  And so all of the youth and a number of the young adults as leaders are away this morning there.
[500.90 --> 509.90]  And so we've been praying for them all week, trusting that they've been having fun and have been safe, at least safe within the parameters of still yet fun.
[509.90 --> 515.90]  And that this morning as they worship there, they also encounter Jesus.
[515.90 --> 519.90]  And so if you're looking around and wondering what's going on, that's probably part of it.
[519.90 --> 523.90]  If there are other things and questions you have, I'm happy to answer those.
[523.90 --> 525.90]  And so please grab me.
[525.90 --> 533.90]  If you are visiting with us this morning, either in person or online, there is a Connect card available and a digital version, a QR code.
[533.90 --> 541.90]  You can scan that and we would love to hear about what's going on in your life, how we might pray for you or meet whatever needs you have.
[541.90 --> 545.90]  Later today in our worship, we will draw lots for the office of deacon.
[545.90 --> 547.90]  We're excited for that opportunity.
[547.90 --> 551.90]  And as well, just one more announcement.
[551.90 --> 559.90]  We have been asking for volunteers to sign up to lead children's worship time during the summer months.
[559.90 --> 561.90]  We have a condensed version for preschoolers.
[561.90 --> 563.90]  They go out and they do a story.
[563.90 --> 568.90]  And we have filled all of those spaces available except for one.
[568.90 --> 570.90]  So there's one slot yet available.
[570.90 --> 573.90]  Please, you can go to the back table there to see that.
[573.90 --> 576.90]  And we have lots of room for helpers.
[576.90 --> 578.90]  And so not just teachers, but helpers.
[578.90 --> 584.90]  And so this is a great opportunity for some of you younger people to jump in and serve and provide there.
[584.90 --> 588.90]  And so please think about that and then sign up at the back table there.
[588.90 --> 591.90]  I misspoke one more announcement.
[591.90 --> 594.90]  Next week, Sunday is Lord's Supper.
[594.90 --> 600.90]  We will gather as a church family around the table where we will encounter Jesus in the bread and the juice.
[600.90 --> 604.90]  And so we encourage you to spend this week preparing your hearts and your minds.
[604.90 --> 611.90]  If you have kids, talking to them about what that experience is like that we can come together as the body of Christ to that table.
[611.90 --> 617.90]  This morning we come together as the body of Christ to worship our God and he welcomes us in this place.
[617.90 --> 624.90]  And so I'm going to invite you as you're able to stand that we might receive God's welcome and greeting together.
[624.90 --> 637.90]  Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son, and our Savior.
[637.90 --> 641.90]  Through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[641.90 --> 642.90]  Amen.
[642.90 --> 649.90]  Let's worship God this morning.
[649.90 --> 650.90]  Amen.
[653.90 --> 654.90]  Amen.
[658.90 --> 660.90]  Amen.
[660.90 --> 662.90]  Amen.
[662.90 --> 664.90]  Amen.
[664.90 --> 668.90]  Amen.
[668.90 --> 670.90]  Amen.
[670.90 --> 671.90]  Amen.
[671.90 --> 672.88]  Amen.
[672.88 --> 681.20]  I pick these first two songs
[681.20 --> 685.44]  because in this world you can have trouble
[685.44 --> 687.64]  but this just reminds us that
[687.64 --> 690.50]  that Christ has overcome
[690.50 --> 692.98]  and so let's join our voices
[702.88 --> 712.36]  Why should I fear men
[712.36 --> 715.62]  and remain the heavens
[715.62 --> 719.98]  Why should I be afraid
[719.98 --> 724.10]  if you put the stars in place
[724.10 --> 727.82]  Why should I lose heart
[727.82 --> 731.82]  when I know how great you are
[731.82 --> 735.58]  Why should I give up
[735.58 --> 740.28]  when your hands are full of love
[740.28 --> 747.00]  In this world we'll have trouble
[747.00 --> 755.06]  but you have overcome the world
[755.06 --> 764.60]  You shine brighter than the brightest star
[764.60 --> 772.66]  Your love pure than the purest star
[772.66 --> 776.42]  You shine
[776.42 --> 782.18]  filling us with courage and strength
[782.18 --> 785.94]  To follow you
[785.94 --> 796.02]  Why should I fear men
[796.02 --> 799.78]  You gain the heavens
[799.78 --> 804.06]  Why should I be afraid
[804.06 --> 808.14]  If you put the stars in place
[808.14 --> 812.16]  Why should I lose heart
[812.16 --> 815.92]  And you know how great you are
[815.92 --> 819.62]  Why should I give up
[819.62 --> 821.62]  When you plan to fall in place
[821.62 --> 826.08]  When you plan to fall in place
[826.08 --> 833.08]  In this world we'll have trouble
[833.08 --> 835.08]  You have overcome the world
[835.08 --> 840.08]  You have overcome the world
[840.08 --> 842.08]  You shine brighter than the brightest star
[842.08 --> 855.96]  You shine brighter than the brightest star
[855.96 --> 862.34]  Your love pure than the brightest star
[862.34 --> 867.42]  You shine brighter than the purest star
[867.42 --> 869.72]  You shine
[869.72 --> 879.72]  Filling us with courage and strength to follow you.
[881.24 --> 886.82]  Shine brighter than the brightest star.
[887.42 --> 894.98]  Your love, purer than the purest heart.
[894.98 --> 898.40]  You shine.
[899.52 --> 907.70]  Filling us with courage and strength to follow you.
[924.98 --> 954.96]  guitar solo
[954.96 --> 957.54]  With a melody
[957.54 --> 964.78]  You surround me with a song
[964.78 --> 969.18]  Of deliverance
[969.18 --> 972.38]  From my enemies
[972.38 --> 978.20]  Till all my fear has gone
[978.20 --> 984.96]  I'm no longer a slave to fear
[984.96 --> 991.96]  I am a child of God
[991.96 --> 999.28]  I'm no longer a slave to fear
[999.28 --> 1006.54]  I am a child of God
[1006.54 --> 1022.36]  From my mother's womb
[1022.36 --> 1026.12]  You have chosen me
[1026.12 --> 1031.86]  Love has called my name
[1031.86 --> 1036.24]  I've been born again
[1036.24 --> 1038.88]  To your family
[1038.88 --> 1045.18]  Blood passed through my veins
[1045.18 --> 1051.76]  I'm no longer a slave to fear
[1051.76 --> 1058.44]  I am a child of God
[1058.44 --> 1065.44]  I'm no longer a slave to fear
[1065.44 --> 1072.26]  I am a child of God
[1072.26 --> 1078.96]  I'm no longer a slave to fear
[1078.96 --> 1083.28]  I am a child of God
[1083.28 --> 1088.86]  I'm no longer a slave to fear
[1091.54 --> 1095.86]  I am a child of God
[1095.86 --> 1099.16]  I am a child of God.
[1111.16 --> 1118.06]  You swept the sea so I could walk right through it.
[1118.58 --> 1122.00]  My fears were drowned in perfect love.
[1122.00 --> 1130.00]  You rescued me so I could stand and say,
[1131.00 --> 1136.00]  I am a child of God.
[1138.00 --> 1144.00]  You swept the sea so I could walk right through it.
[1145.00 --> 1148.00]  My fears were drowned in perfect love.
[1148.00 --> 1156.00]  You rescued me so I could stand and say,
[1156.00 --> 1162.00]  I am a child of God.
[1164.00 --> 1168.00]  I'm no longer a slave to fear.
[1168.00 --> 1176.00]  I am a child of God.
[1176.00 --> 1183.00]  I'm no longer a slave to fear.
[1185.00 --> 1191.00]  I am a child of God.
[1191.00 --> 1193.00]  Let me see it.
[1200.00 --> 1205.00]  I was reading in Ephesians and I came across Ephesians 2 verse 10.
[1205.00 --> 1209.00]  It kind of reminded me a bit of what Pastor Chris was talking about.
[1209.00 --> 1213.00]  If I'm wrong, you can tell me later, okay?
[1213.00 --> 1214.00]  Not now.
[1215.00 --> 1217.00]  Anyway, the verse says,
[1217.00 --> 1221.00]  For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works,
[1221.00 --> 1224.00]  which God has prepared us in advance to do.
[1224.00 --> 1227.00]  And I know, I think it was a couple weeks ago,
[1227.00 --> 1231.00]  Pastor Chris was kind of challenging us to get out of our comfort zone
[1231.00 --> 1235.00]  and to trust God to work in our lives
[1236.00 --> 1240.00]  and to give us direction in ministry and in life.
[1241.00 --> 1247.00]  And it sounded a lot like what I thought Paul was saying,
[1247.00 --> 1252.00]  that God has prepared good works for us to do in Christ.
[1252.00 --> 1255.00]  And it all sounds pretty good to me
[1256.00 --> 1260.00]  until I look at stepping out of my really comfortable life,
[1260.00 --> 1262.00]  like the comforts that we have,
[1263.00 --> 1267.00]  the less risk I have, the happier I feel sometimes.
[1268.00 --> 1270.00]  And so it may be questioned,
[1271.00 --> 1274.00]  do I trust God enough to risk stepping out
[1274.00 --> 1278.00]  and exploring what God has in mind for me and for us?
[1279.00 --> 1283.00]  Because it is just so easy to stay in the boat.
[1286.00 --> 1287.00]  Let's pray.
[1288.00 --> 1291.00]  Father God, we do want to be pleasing to you.
[1292.00 --> 1296.00]  Forgive us for staying so long in our own comfortable places
[1297.00 --> 1299.00]  and for not trusting your Holy Spirit to lead us
[1300.00 --> 1302.00]  into what you have in store for us in Christ.
[1302.00 --> 1306.00]  Father God, as we step out, guide us with your Spirit.
[1307.00 --> 1311.00]  Help us as your family to reach out to this broken world in your love.
[1312.00 --> 1315.00]  May our lives be a sacrifice of praise to you, Lord.
[1316.00 --> 1317.00]  Amen.
[1319.00 --> 1321.00]  Why don't we rise and join in a couple more songs?
[1321.00 --> 1324.14]  Lord God, we last
[1326.00 --> 1327.08]  . . . . . . equally
[1328.00 --> 1329.94]  . . . . the nice creation with a Kaufman.
[1330.00 --> 1334.00]  Father God on Jesus, we will stand and remember as a precious family.
[1335.00 --> 1337.00]  Heaven and a mansion with a heart is.
[1337.00 --> 1338.00]  Father God would likes to לח and 가' ex-Aков…
[1338.00 --> 1342.00]  Aahär구
[1342.00 --> 1357.72]  Lord, I want to be a sacrifice
[1357.72 --> 1364.94]  Lord, I want to be pleasing to you
[1364.94 --> 1371.80]  Lord, I want your love to rule my life
[1371.80 --> 1378.42]  And be the one that you shine through
[1378.42 --> 1384.86]  Jesus, I give you all
[1384.86 --> 1392.60]  Every part of me cries out your name
[1392.60 --> 1397.76]  Jesus, I give you all
[1397.76 --> 1402.38]  Living and holy
[1402.38 --> 1405.78]  Living and holy
[1405.78 --> 1410.38]  Living and holy for you
[1410.38 --> 1418.38]  Lord, I want to be a sacrifice
[1418.38 --> 1425.00]  Lord, I want to be pleasing to you
[1425.00 --> 1433.00]  Lord, I want your love to rule my life
[1433.00 --> 1439.00]  And be the one that you shine through
[1439.00 --> 1445.62]  Jesus, I give you all
[1445.62 --> 1453.62]  Every part of me cries out your name
[1453.62 --> 1458.62]  Jesus, I give you all
[1458.62 --> 1463.24]  Living and holy
[1463.24 --> 1465.24]  Living and holy
[1465.24 --> 1466.64]  Living and holy
[1466.64 --> 1471.24]  Living and holy for you
[1471.24 --> 1478.24]  Jesus, I give you all
[1478.24 --> 1482.86]  Every part of me
[1482.86 --> 1486.86]  Every part of me cries out your name
[1486.86 --> 1492.86]  Jesus, I give you all
[1492.86 --> 1497.48]  Living and holy
[1497.48 --> 1499.48]  Living and holy
[1499.48 --> 1500.88]  Living and holy
[1500.88 --> 1507.48]  Living and holy for you
[1507.48 --> 1513.50]  Living and holy
[1513.50 --> 1516.10]  Lord, I want to be pleasing to you
[1516.10 --> 1518.42]  Lord, I want to be pleasing to you
[1518.42 --> 1520.42]  Amen.
[1548.42 --> 1552.42]  I find my rest
[1553.10 --> 1555.42]  Without you
[1556.04 --> 1558.42]  I fall apart
[1559.84 --> 1562.42]  You're the one
[1562.42 --> 1566.42]  That guides my heart
[1567.84 --> 1573.42]  Lord, I need you
[1573.42 --> 1577.42]  Oh, I need you
[1577.42 --> 1581.42]  Every hour
[1582.28 --> 1584.42]  I need you
[1585.24 --> 1587.42]  My one defense
[1588.70 --> 1591.42]  My righteousness
[1591.96 --> 1597.42]  Oh, God, how I need you
[1597.42 --> 1604.42]  When the sin runs deep
[1604.42 --> 1608.42]  Your grace is born
[1608.42 --> 1611.42]  Where grace is found
[1611.42 --> 1615.42]  Is where you are
[1615.42 --> 1618.42]  And where you are

[2093.10 --> 2094.36]  Who are staying here
[2094.36 --> 2095.68]  On the back table
[2095.68 --> 2097.14]  The children's worship time table
[2097.14 --> 2099.68]  There's this little two pages
[2099.68 --> 2101.40]  That has four activities
[2101.40 --> 2102.34]  For you to do
[2102.34 --> 2104.30]  During our worship together
[2104.30 --> 2105.48]  If you're interested in that
[2105.48 --> 2106.78]  So there's a coloring page
[2106.78 --> 2108.14]  And a word search
[2108.14 --> 2108.88]  And the like
[2108.88 --> 2110.14]  And that is all about
[2110.14 --> 2112.10]  The text that we're going to talk about

[2113.04 --> 2114.54]  For the rest of the summer as well
[2114.54 --> 2116.56]  For the rest of the summer
[2116.56 --> 2117.64]  There will be clipboards
[2117.64 --> 2119.12]  And crayons that go with it
[2119.12 --> 2120.86]  Amazon wasn't quick enough
[2120.86 --> 2122.90]  We don't have that this week
[2122.90 --> 2124.30]  But you can figure it out
[2124.30 --> 2125.24]  For this week
[2125.24 --> 2125.66]  Okay
[2125.66 --> 2126.94]  So you can talk to your parents
[2126.94 --> 2128.32]  About maybe getting this
[2128.32 --> 2129.44]  At the back table there
[2129.44 --> 2131.16]  Okay we're going to do the blessing
[2131.16 --> 2131.50]  Okay
[2131.50 --> 2132.34]  So the way that works
[2132.34 --> 2133.64]  Is we're going to hold our hands up
[2133.64 --> 2134.52]  And then we're going to say
[2134.52 --> 2135.88]  Really loud for everyone to hear
[2135.88 --> 2137.24]  The Lord be with you
[2137.24 --> 2138.60]  And then they're all going to say
[2138.60 --> 2139.92]  Really loud for you to hear
[2139.92 --> 2141.18]  And also with you
[2141.18 --> 2142.22]  Everyone else
[2142.22 --> 2143.22]  I'm going to invite you to stand
[2143.22 --> 2146.50]  And then once we do this
[2146.50 --> 2148.28]  Kids three to five
[2148.28 --> 2149.54]  With your parents permission
[2149.54 --> 2150.46]  You may head to
[2150.46 --> 2151.54]  Children's worship time
[2151.54 --> 2152.18]  The rest of you
[2152.18 --> 2153.56]  Can go wherever it is

[2153.96 --> 2154.98]  Ready

[2846.92 --> 2847.64]  Into a deeper
[2847.64 --> 2848.42]  Relationship
[2848.42 --> 2848.92]  With you
[2848.92 --> 2854.98]  God as we
[2854.98 --> 2856.16]  Celebrate
[2856.16 --> 2856.90]  The joys
[2856.90 --> 2857.66]  With each other
[2857.66 --> 2859.06]  We also think
[2859.06 --> 2859.96]  Ahead of
[2859.96 --> 2861.02]  To next week
[2861.02 --> 2862.36]  Where we celebrate
[2862.36 --> 2863.12]  Lord's Supper
[2863.12 --> 2864.50]  In remembrance
[2864.50 --> 2865.92]  Of who you are
[2865.92 --> 2866.82]  And what you have
[2866.82 --> 2867.22]  Done
[2867.22 --> 2869.12]  For us
[2869.12 --> 2870.90]  Help us to walk
[2870.90 --> 2871.76]  In this week
[2871.76 --> 2873.44]  Thinking ahead
[2873.44 --> 2874.72]  To that moment
[2874.72 --> 2875.46]  Where we gather
[2875.46 --> 2876.36]  Around the table
[2876.36 --> 2876.82]  Together
[2876.82 --> 2878.64]  As a community
[2878.64 --> 2879.50]  In remembrance
[2879.50 --> 2883.82]  God we also
[2883.82 --> 2884.44]  Look outward
[2884.44 --> 2885.64]  We look outward
[2885.64 --> 2886.44]  To the world
[2886.44 --> 2887.26]  To the pain
[2887.26 --> 2887.88]  That the world
[2887.88 --> 2888.74]  Is experiencing
[2888.74 --> 2893.56]  There's so much
[2893.56 --> 2894.40]  Going on
[2894.40 --> 2895.40]  We turn on
[2895.40 --> 2896.04]  Our phones
[2896.04 --> 2896.74]  We turn on
[2896.74 --> 2897.34]  Our TVs
[2897.34 --> 2898.08]  And there
[2898.08 --> 2899.48]  There's an endless
[2899.48 --> 2901.24]  List of pain
[2901.24 --> 2903.08]  And struggles
[2903.08 --> 2905.02]  And war
[2905.02 --> 2906.02]  To look at
[2906.02 --> 2907.42]  And to be
[2907.42 --> 2908.10]  Disheartened
[2908.10 --> 2908.80]  By God
[2908.80 --> 2911.70]  I pray
[2911.70 --> 2913.36]  That we would
[2913.36 --> 2914.62]  Come to you
[2914.62 --> 2915.76]  In prayer
[2915.76 --> 2918.06]  For these people
[2918.06 --> 2919.00]  That are experiencing
[2919.00 --> 2919.90]  These hardships
[2919.90 --> 2921.70]  God we pray
[2921.70 --> 2922.28]  For the war
[2922.28 --> 2922.92]  In Ukraine
[2922.92 --> 2923.72]  That continues
[2923.72 --> 2926.14]  We can't imagine
[2926.14 --> 2928.24]  Can't imagine
[2928.24 --> 2929.94]  What it must
[2929.94 --> 2930.56]  Be like
[2930.56 --> 2932.04]  Many of us
[2932.04 --> 2932.84]  Have never seen
[2932.84 --> 2933.22]  War
[2933.22 --> 2934.30]  We don't know
[2934.30 --> 2934.98]  What that is
[2934.98 --> 2935.50]  Like
[2935.50 --> 2936.34]  We see movies
[2936.34 --> 2938.26]  And we still
[2938.26 --> 2939.38]  Cannot fathom
[2939.38 --> 2940.14]  The pain
[2940.14 --> 2940.84]  And the suffering
[2940.84 --> 2941.58]  That they must
[2941.58 --> 2942.36]  Be going through
[2942.36 --> 2944.10]  So God
[2944.10 --> 2944.58]  We pray
[2944.58 --> 2945.12]  That you would
[2945.12 --> 2947.30]  You would find
[2947.30 --> 2947.88]  The path
[2947.88 --> 2948.38]  Forward
[2948.38 --> 2949.96]  For the pain
[2949.96 --> 2950.72]  To stop
[2950.72 --> 2957.18]  Thank you
[2957.18 --> 2957.80]  For this time
[2957.80 --> 2958.34]  To gather
[2958.34 --> 2958.92]  Lord
[2958.92 --> 2960.48]  That we can
[2960.48 --> 2961.14]  Be together
[2961.14 --> 2962.38]  And worship
[2962.38 --> 2962.76]  You
[2962.76 --> 2963.40]  And pray
[2963.40 --> 2964.20]  For each other
[2964.20 --> 2964.76]  And live
[2964.76 --> 2965.58]  Life together
[2965.58 --> 2967.12]  I pray
[2967.12 --> 2967.54]  That you would
[2967.54 --> 2967.92]  Be with
[2967.92 --> 2968.70]  Pastor Chris
[2968.70 --> 2969.48]  As he brings
[2969.48 --> 2969.74]  You
[2969.74 --> 2970.90]  Brings us
[2970.90 --> 2971.70]  Your word
[2971.70 --> 2973.00]  And that our
[2973.00 --> 2973.66]  Hearts would be
[2973.66 --> 2974.24]  Opened
[2974.24 --> 2975.02]  To listen
[2975.02 --> 2975.94]  And to listen
[2975.94 --> 2976.50]  To you
[2976.50 --> 2976.86]  And your
[2976.86 --> 2977.46]  Holy Spirit
[2977.46 --> 2977.96]  Working
[2977.96 --> 2979.14]  In your name
[2979.14 --> 2979.58]  We pray
[2979.58 --> 2980.26]  Amen
[2995.58 --> 3009.62]  Morning
[3009.62 --> 3011.22]  In our
[3011.22 --> 3011.60]  Time
[3011.60 --> 3011.98]  Together
[3011.98 --> 3012.34]  We're going
[3012.34 --> 3013.72]  To conclude
[3013.72 --> 3014.60]  The series
[3014.60 --> 3015.12]  That we have
[3015.12 --> 3015.64]  Been working
[3015.64 --> 3015.92]  Through
[3015.92 --> 3016.26]  Called
[3016.26 --> 3017.20]  Holy Habits
[3017.20 --> 3018.22]  We have
[3018.22 --> 3018.66]  Given out
[3018.66 --> 3019.50]  These books
[3019.50 --> 3020.08]  For you to
[3020.08 --> 3020.68]  Take home
[3020.68 --> 3021.70]  And to use
[3021.70 --> 3022.28]  Throughout the
[3022.28 --> 3022.56]  Week
[3022.56 --> 3023.60]  As you
[3023.60 --> 3024.36]  Continue to
[3024.36 --> 3024.98]  Put into
[3024.98 --> 3025.50]  Practice
[3025.50 --> 3026.16]  Those things
[3026.16 --> 3026.54]  We have
[3026.54 --> 3026.78]  Been
[3026.78 --> 3028.38]  Discussing
[3028.38 --> 3028.64]  And those
[3028.64 --> 3029.02]  Habits
[3029.02 --> 3029.40]  We have
[3029.40 --> 3029.86]  Hopefully
[3029.86 --> 3030.40]  The Lord
[3030.40 --> 3030.74]  Willing
[3030.74 --> 3031.50]  Been forming
[3031.50 --> 3033.00]  In our
[3033.00 --> 3033.78]  Lives
[3033.78 --> 3034.40]  Together
[3034.40 --> 3036.74]  Now
[3036.74 --> 3039.32]  Maybe
[3039.32 --> 3043.82]  Maybe the
[3043.82 --> 3044.46]  End is
[3044.46 --> 3044.92]  The wrong
[3044.92 --> 3045.54]  The end of
[3045.54 --> 3045.86]  A series
[3045.86 --> 3046.36]  Is the wrong
[3046.36 --> 3046.82]  Place to
[3046.82 --> 3047.24]  Bring this
[3047.24 --> 3047.48]  Up
[3047.48 --> 3047.80]  But
[3047.80 --> 3050.40]  I know
[3050.40 --> 3051.16]  That for
[3051.16 --> 3052.08]  Some of
[3052.08 --> 3052.52]  You
[3052.52 --> 3054.60]  For some
[3054.60 --> 3055.28]  Of us
[3055.28 --> 3055.78]  Here
[3055.78 --> 3057.12]  In worship
[3057.12 --> 3058.00]  And in
[3058.00 --> 3058.78]  This church
[3058.78 --> 3059.28]  Community
[3059.28 --> 3060.32]  That when
[3060.32 --> 3060.88]  We start
[3060.88 --> 3061.98]  Talking about
[3061.98 --> 3063.66]  Holy habits
[3063.66 --> 3064.04]  Or
[3064.04 --> 3065.20]  Spiritual
[3065.20 --> 3066.38]  Disciplines
[3066.38 --> 3067.42]  For some
[3067.42 --> 3067.92]  Of you
[3067.92 --> 3069.42]  Your
[3069.42 --> 3071.58]  Antennae
[3071.58 --> 3072.22]  Go up
[3072.22 --> 3073.74]  And you're
[3073.74 --> 3074.44]  Like oh
[3074.44 --> 3075.14]  What's he
[3075.14 --> 3075.38]  Going to
[3075.38 --> 3075.82]  Talk about
[3075.82 --> 3076.20]  Now
[3076.20 --> 3077.58]  That sounds
[3077.58 --> 3078.28]  Like strange
[3078.28 --> 3078.92]  Mysticism
[3078.92 --> 3080.24]  That sounds
[3080.24 --> 3080.96]  Like this
[3080.96 --> 3081.58]  Eastern
[3081.58 --> 3081.96]  New
[3081.96 --> 3082.28]  Age
[3082.28 --> 3082.66]  Ism
[3082.66 --> 3085.80]  And so
[3085.80 --> 3086.26]  Maybe
[3086.26 --> 3087.02]  If that's
[3087.02 --> 3087.22]  You
[3087.22 --> 3087.74]  You haven't
[3087.74 --> 3088.20]  Really been
[3088.20 --> 3088.82]  Hearing or
[3088.82 --> 3089.38]  Listening
[3089.38 --> 3091.54]  And I want
[3091.54 --> 3091.98]  To invite
[3091.98 --> 3092.56]  You on
[3092.56 --> 3093.12]  This last
[3093.12 --> 3093.60]  Chance
[3093.60 --> 3094.16]  To ask
[3094.16 --> 3094.72]  What if
[3094.72 --> 3095.34]  This is
[3095.34 --> 3095.80]  The right
[3095.80 --> 3096.32]  Way to
[3096.32 --> 3096.76]  Be a
[3096.76 --> 3097.18]  Disciple
[3097.18 --> 3097.66]  Of jesus
[3097.66 --> 3098.18]  Just ask
[3098.18 --> 3098.74]  The question
[3098.74 --> 3099.84]  And wrestle
[3099.84 --> 3100.32]  With that
[3100.32 --> 3102.06]  For others
[3102.06 --> 3102.70]  Of you
[3102.70 --> 3103.62]  As we
[3103.62 --> 3104.28]  Start talking
[3104.28 --> 3105.10]  About holy
[3105.10 --> 3105.58]  Habits
[3105.58 --> 3105.88]  As we
[3105.88 --> 3106.42]  Start talking
[3106.42 --> 3106.92]  About these
[3106.92 --> 3107.46]  Kinds of
[3107.46 --> 3107.90]  Things that
[3107.90 --> 3108.16]  We are
[3108.16 --> 3108.68]  Called to
[3108.68 --> 3109.56]  To shape
[3109.56 --> 3110.28]  Our life
[3110.28 --> 3110.74]  Around
[3110.74 --> 3112.00]  There's this
[3112.00 --> 3112.60]  Deep feeling
[3112.60 --> 3113.16]  Of like
[3113.16 --> 3113.98]  Guilt or
[3113.98 --> 3114.50]  Shame
[3114.50 --> 3115.72]  Because we
[3115.72 --> 3115.98]  Go I
[3115.98 --> 3116.40]  Know I
[3116.40 --> 3116.84]  Should do
[3116.84 --> 3117.16]  This
[3117.16 --> 3117.70]  I know I
[3117.70 --> 3118.02]  Should do
[3118.02 --> 3118.58]  More of
[3118.58 --> 3118.78]  This
[3118.78 --> 3119.28]  I know I
[3119.28 --> 3119.62]  Should be
[3119.62 --> 3120.28]  Engaged or
[3120.28 --> 3120.80]  Involved
[3120.80 --> 3120.98]  Or
[3120.98 --> 3122.26]  Practicing
[3122.26 --> 3123.02]  More prayer
[3123.02 --> 3123.46]  Or
[3123.46 --> 3124.44]  Community
[3124.44 --> 3125.32]  Or
[3125.32 --> 3126.12]  Bible
[3126.12 --> 3126.70]  Study
[3126.70 --> 3128.46]  And that
[3128.46 --> 3128.86]  Guilt
[3128.86 --> 3129.62]  That shame
[3129.62 --> 3130.02]  Has
[3130.02 --> 3131.42]  The force
[3131.42 --> 3131.84]  To
[3131.84 --> 3132.86]  Kind of
[3132.86 --> 3133.42]  Hold at
[3133.42 --> 3133.72]  Bay
[3133.72 --> 3134.08]  What it
[3134.08 --> 3134.38]  Is we
[3134.38 --> 3134.88]  Talk about
[3134.88 --> 3135.14]  Here
[3135.14 --> 3136.12]  Because we're
[3136.12 --> 3136.54]  Afraid that
[3136.54 --> 3136.84]  It's going to
[3136.84 --> 3137.18]  Make us
[3137.18 --> 3137.68]  Feel even
[3137.68 --> 3138.16]  More of
[3138.16 --> 3138.44]  That
[3138.44 --> 3139.98]  And again
[3139.98 --> 3140.42]  If that's
[3140.42 --> 3141.04]  You this
[3141.04 --> 3141.34]  Morning
[3141.34 --> 3142.16]  I just
[3142.16 --> 3142.34]  Want to
[3142.34 --> 3142.72]  Encourage
[3142.72 --> 3143.18]  You and
[3143.18 --> 3143.80]  Ask if
[3143.80 --> 3143.98]  You would
[3143.98 --> 3144.14]  Just
[3144.14 --> 3146.14]  Listen
[3146.14 --> 3146.94]  With a
[3146.94 --> 3147.50]  Soft
[3147.50 --> 3148.24]  Heart
[3148.24 --> 3149.28]  Not one
[3149.28 --> 3149.96]  That condemns
[3149.96 --> 3150.60]  Yourself
[3150.60 --> 3151.04]  But one
[3151.04 --> 3151.64]  That asks
[3151.64 --> 3152.22]  What does
[3152.22 --> 3152.78]  Jesus have
[3152.78 --> 3153.34]  For me
[3153.34 --> 3154.08]  In this
[3154.08 --> 3154.40]  Moment
[3154.40 --> 3154.82]  And in
[3154.82 --> 3155.02]  This
[3155.02 --> 3155.42]  Practice
[3155.42 --> 3157.12]  Now
[3157.12 --> 3159.94]  To address
[3159.94 --> 3160.46]  The first
[3160.46 --> 3161.02]  And then
[3161.02 --> 3161.74]  Throughout
[3161.74 --> 3162.16]  To the
[3162.16 --> 3162.44]  Second
[3162.44 --> 3163.72]  I want
[3163.72 --> 3163.96]  To be
[3163.96 --> 3164.54]  Really clear
[3164.54 --> 3164.84]  That when
[3164.84 --> 3165.86]  We started
[3165.86 --> 3167.12]  This series
[3167.12 --> 3167.60]  Together
[3167.60 --> 3168.42]  I mentioned
[3168.42 --> 3169.24]  That all
[3169.24 --> 3169.74]  Of these
[3169.74 --> 3170.54]  Practices
[3170.54 --> 3171.42]  That we
[3171.42 --> 3171.76]  Were going
[3171.76 --> 3172.32]  To highlight
[3172.32 --> 3172.80]  All of
[3172.80 --> 3173.38]  These holy
[3173.38 --> 3174.00]  Habits
[3174.00 --> 3174.58]  That we
[3174.58 --> 3174.84]  Were going
[3174.84 --> 3175.48]  To discuss
[3175.48 --> 3175.94]  Can be
[3175.94 --> 3176.40]  Found
[3176.40 --> 3177.18]  In the
[3177.18 --> 3178.34]  Description
[3178.34 --> 3179.08]  Of what
[3179.08 --> 3179.82]  The earliest
[3179.82 --> 3180.64]  Church
[3180.64 --> 3181.44]  Did in
[3181.44 --> 3182.06]  Their life
[3182.06 --> 3182.54]  Together
[3182.54 --> 3183.72]  In Acts
[3183.72 --> 3183.98]  2
[3183.98 --> 3185.14]  So I'm
[3185.14 --> 3185.30]  Going to
[3185.30 --> 3185.80]  Start us
[3185.80 --> 3186.24]  In Acts
[3186.24 --> 3186.56]  2
[3186.56 --> 3186.92]  But the
[3186.92 --> 3187.16]  Text
[3187.16 --> 3187.42]  That we're
[3187.42 --> 3187.66]  Going to
[3187.66 --> 3188.28]  Live for
[3188.28 --> 3188.72]  The majority
[3188.72 --> 3189.04]  Of our
[3189.04 --> 3189.32]  Time
[3189.32 --> 3189.72]  In is
[3189.72 --> 3190.06]  Actually
[3190.06 --> 3190.56]  In Luke
[3190.56 --> 3191.04]  12
[3191.04 --> 3193.48]  So if
[3193.48 --> 3193.76]  You want
[3193.76 --> 3194.06]  To read
[3194.06 --> 3194.40]  Along
[3194.40 --> 3194.72]  You can
[3194.72 --> 3195.02]  Find
[3195.02 --> 3195.38]  Acts
[3195.38 --> 3195.74]  2
[3195.74 --> 3198.08]  But it
[3198.08 --> 3198.36]  Will be
[3198.36 --> 3198.62]  On the
[3198.62 --> 3198.94]  Screen
[3198.94 --> 3200.02]  Behind me
[3200.02 --> 3200.38]  As well
[3200.38 --> 3201.90]  And so
[3201.90 --> 3202.86]  In Acts
[3202.86 --> 3203.16]  2
[3203.16 --> 3203.68]  Starting at
[3203.68 --> 3204.36]  Verse 42
[3204.36 --> 3206.04]  We read
[3206.04 --> 3206.76]  They devoted
[3206.76 --> 3207.76]  Themselves to
[3207.76 --> 3208.50]  The apostles
[3208.50 --> 3209.08]  Teaching
[3209.08 --> 3210.86]  And so
[3210.86 --> 3211.48]  In our
[3211.48 --> 3211.86]  Worship
[3211.86 --> 3213.04]  We discussed
[3213.04 --> 3213.86]  What listening
[3213.86 --> 3214.56]  To Jesus
[3214.56 --> 3215.58]  Word by

[3216.58 --> 3217.30]  Being in
[3217.30 --> 3217.96]  The word
[3217.96 --> 3219.00]  Reading it
[3219.00 --> 3219.80]  And studying
[3219.80 --> 3220.46]  The bible
[3220.46 --> 3221.42]  Might mean
[3221.42 --> 3222.02]  For you
[3222.02 --> 3223.06]  And in
[3223.06 --> 3223.88]  Your community
[3223.88 --> 3226.40]  They devoted
[3226.40 --> 3227.10]  Themselves to
[3227.10 --> 3227.60]  The apostles
[3227.60 --> 3228.10]  Teaching
[3228.10 --> 3228.50]  To the
[3228.50 --> 3228.86]  Breaking
[3228.86 --> 3229.64]  Of bread
[3229.64 --> 3230.46]  And to
[3230.46 --> 3230.84]  Prayer
[3230.84 --> 3232.32]  And so
[3232.32 --> 3233.48]  We discussed
[3233.48 --> 3234.10]  Worship
[3234.10 --> 3235.18]  And devotional
[3235.18 --> 3235.58]  Prayer
[3235.58 --> 3236.34]  And we
[3236.34 --> 3237.02]  Offered some
[3237.02 --> 3237.62]  Ways for
[3237.62 --> 3237.86]  You to

[3238.28 --> 3238.52]  More

[3239.70 --> 3240.20]  Both by

[3240.76 --> 3241.80]  And in
[3241.80 --> 3242.32]  Community
[3242.32 --> 3244.16]  And they
[3244.16 --> 3244.86]  Keep looking
[3244.86 --> 3245.50]  Keep reading
[3245.50 --> 3246.08]  They devoted
[3246.08 --> 3246.98]  Themselves to
[3246.98 --> 3248.22]  Fellowship
[3248.22 --> 3248.48]  Right
[3248.48 --> 3249.04]  All the
[3249.04 --> 3249.48]  Believers
[3249.48 --> 3250.14]  Were together
[3250.14 --> 3250.88]  Every day
[3250.88 --> 3251.48]  They continued
[3251.48 --> 3251.94]  To meet
[3251.94 --> 3252.36]  Together
[3252.36 --> 3253.12]  In the
[3253.12 --> 3253.56]  Temple's
[3253.56 --> 3253.94]  Courts
[3253.94 --> 3254.56]  They had
[3254.56 --> 3255.22]  Glad and
[3255.22 --> 3255.80]  Sincere
[3255.80 --> 3256.26]  Hearts

[3258.02 --> 3259.00]  The people
[3259.00 --> 3260.22]  And so
[3260.22 --> 3260.84]  We talked
[3260.84 --> 3261.30]  About
[3261.30 --> 3262.26]  Resting
[3262.26 --> 3263.16]  In
[3263.16 --> 3263.80]  Community
[3263.80 --> 3264.32]  Right
[3264.32 --> 3265.14]  About trusting
[3265.14 --> 3265.72]  God's
[3265.72 --> 3266.42]  Provision
[3266.42 --> 3267.10]  And living
[3267.10 --> 3267.70]  Out of
[3267.70 --> 3268.74]  An eternal

[3269.48 --> 3269.84]  Again
[3269.84 --> 3270.74]  By yourself
[3270.74 --> 3271.54]  And in
[3271.54 --> 3272.46]  Community
[3272.46 --> 3273.22]  Together
[3273.22 --> 3273.82]  Sharing

[3275.16 --> 3276.32]  And story
[3276.32 --> 3277.04]  As a
[3277.04 --> 3277.74]  The phrase
[3277.74 --> 3278.16]  That Kevin
[3278.16 --> 3278.72]  Used and I
[3278.72 --> 3279.46]  Really loved it
[3279.46 --> 3280.12]  As an act
[3280.12 --> 3281.18]  Of resistance
[3281.18 --> 3282.56]  To the
[3282.56 --> 3283.04]  Formative
[3283.04 --> 3283.74]  Idols
[3283.74 --> 3285.02]  Of the
[3285.02 --> 3285.32]  World
[3285.32 --> 3286.88]  And then
[3286.88 --> 3287.34]  Now
[3287.34 --> 3288.36]  At the
[3288.36 --> 3288.88]  End
[3288.88 --> 3290.62]  They devoted
[3290.62 --> 3291.52]  Themselves to
[3291.52 --> 3292.24]  Being together
[3292.24 --> 3293.00]  And holding
[3293.00 --> 3293.94]  Everything
[3293.94 --> 3294.82]  In common
[3294.82 --> 3296.30]  They sold
[3296.30 --> 3297.10]  Property and
[3297.10 --> 3297.90]  Possessions to
[3297.90 --> 3298.28]  Give to
[3298.28 --> 3298.98]  Anyone who
[3298.98 --> 3299.62]  Had need
[3299.62 --> 3300.26]  And then
[3300.26 --> 3300.72]  The last
[3300.72 --> 3301.20]  Line if
[3301.20 --> 3301.46]  You have
[3301.46 --> 3301.94]  That there
[3301.94 --> 3302.64]  And the
[3302.64 --> 3303.42]  Lord added
[3303.42 --> 3303.92]  To their
[3303.92 --> 3304.28]  Number
[3304.28 --> 3304.94]  Daily
[3304.94 --> 3306.02]  Those
[3306.02 --> 3306.70]  Who were
[3306.70 --> 3307.36]  Being saved
[3307.36 --> 3309.28]  And so
[3309.28 --> 3309.82]  For today
[3309.82 --> 3310.58]  For our
[3310.58 --> 3311.06]  Last
[3311.06 --> 3311.78]  Holy
[3311.78 --> 3312.48]  Habit
[3312.48 --> 3313.48]  We are
[3313.48 --> 3314.44]  Giving to
[3314.44 --> 3315.44]  And joining

[3315.94 --> 3316.44]  Jesus
[3316.44 --> 3317.16]  Mission
[3317.16 --> 3317.90]  To the
[3317.90 --> 3318.20]  World
[3318.20 --> 3319.30]  Or the
[3319.30 --> 3319.60]  Way that
[3319.60 --> 3320.06]  We put
[3320.06 --> 3320.36]  It in
[3320.36 --> 3320.92]  That book
[3320.92 --> 3321.56]  If you
[3321.56 --> 3321.84]  Have it
[3321.84 --> 3322.38]  With you
[3322.38 --> 3322.98]  Right
[3322.98 --> 3323.50]  The big
[3323.50 --> 3324.02]  Idea
[3324.02 --> 3324.80]  For this
[3324.80 --> 3325.12]  Morning
[3325.12 --> 3325.66]  Is that
[3325.66 --> 3326.32]  The disciple
[3326.32 --> 3327.14]  Of Jesus
[3327.14 --> 3327.74]  Gives
[3327.74 --> 3328.66]  Themselves
[3328.66 --> 3329.04]  To the
[3329.04 --> 3329.66]  Work of
[3329.66 --> 3330.08]  Jesus
[3330.08 --> 3331.46]  In the
[3331.46 --> 3331.72]  World
[3331.72 --> 3334.14]  And so
[3334.14 --> 3335.36]  Yes
[3335.36 --> 3337.20]  Today
[3337.20 --> 3337.96]  Is going
[3337.96 --> 3338.38]  To be
[3338.38 --> 3338.78]  About
[3338.78 --> 3339.72]  Money
[3339.72 --> 3341.88]  But
[3341.88 --> 3342.30]  Really
[3342.30 --> 3343.72]  Money
[3343.72 --> 3344.12]  As a
[3344.12 --> 3344.46]  Litmus
[3344.46 --> 3345.02]  Test
[3345.02 --> 3345.90]  Right
[3345.90 --> 3346.12]  Because
[3346.12 --> 3346.34]  It's
[3346.34 --> 3346.60]  It's
[3346.60 --> 3346.84]  Going to
[3346.84 --> 3347.02]  Be
[3347.02 --> 3347.32]  About
[3347.32 --> 3347.58]  So
[3347.58 --> 3347.82]  Much
[3347.82 --> 3348.18]  More
[3348.18 --> 3349.74]  Now
[3349.74 --> 3349.92]  We've
[3349.92 --> 3350.08]  Said
[3350.08 --> 3350.28]  This
[3350.28 --> 3350.66]  A bunch
[3350.66 --> 3350.80]  Of
[3350.80 --> 3351.02]  Ways
[3351.02 --> 3351.24]  Over
[3351.24 --> 3351.48]  These
[3351.48 --> 3351.80]  Last
[3351.80 --> 3352.16]  Number
[3352.16 --> 3352.34]  Of
[3352.34 --> 3352.62]  Weeks
[3352.62 --> 3352.78]  But
[3352.78 --> 3352.96]  I'll
[3352.96 --> 3353.14]  Say
[3353.14 --> 3353.26]  It
[3353.26 --> 3353.52]  Again
[3353.52 --> 3353.80]  Because
[3353.80 --> 3354.02]  It is
[3354.02 --> 3354.22]  Worth
[3354.22 --> 3354.70]  Repeating
[3354.70 --> 3355.30]  Right
[3355.30 --> 3355.62]  What
