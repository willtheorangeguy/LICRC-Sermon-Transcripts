[756.66 --> 780.48]  Good morning. Merry Christmas. Welcome to worship. A special welcome if you are a guest with us
[780.48 --> 786.40]  this morning. My name is Chris. I'm one of the pastors here, and it's my privilege, along with
[786.40 --> 793.50]  these others, to lead us in our shared worship this morning. An extra special welcome if you are here
[793.50 --> 799.76]  this morning from Trinity Western University. Thank you for joining us, and we hope that you will
[799.76 --> 804.24]  stick around for a lunch. In fact, if you came on the shuttle, you have to stick around for a lunch
[804.24 --> 810.32]  because it's not going back there until afterwards, but we're so glad that you can make us your Christmas
[810.32 --> 818.12]  family today. Thank you for being here. Before we continue in our Christmas Day worship, just a
[818.12 --> 826.46]  couple announcements, some housekeeping stuff for us here at Emanuel. A reminder that this is the season
[826.46 --> 836.76]  to sign up for the Mexico mission trip, and so this is grade 10s and older. You can sign up for that. The
[836.76 --> 843.76]  sign-up sheets are at the Connect table in the foyer, and so Brandon would also like me to say there's
[843.76 --> 850.84]  today's the last day to sign up, although realistically you have another few days to get that done. So please
[850.84 --> 857.30]  get the form at the back today. Sign up. Talk to Brandon if you have any questions. Brandon,
[857.44 --> 863.38]  wait for a minute. There he is. If you don't know, get connected with him. That trip will happen in March,
[863.38 --> 872.66]  sometime in the March break. Also, tomorrow, Boxing Day, we have a church family skate that's going to
[872.66 --> 880.86]  take place at Twin Rinks, which is on the bypass, 5700 Langley Bypass, just a little ways over there,
[881.24 --> 888.48]  from 2.45 to 3.45. We can skate for that hour, and then we have a room booked for another 45 minutes
[888.48 --> 894.98]  after that for hot chocolate and other refreshments, and so please come with your family. Come by yourself
[894.98 --> 901.38]  to enjoy some time together and skate. If you don't have skates, that's okay. They have free rentals for
[901.38 --> 909.62]  us there at the arena. As well, we wanted to invite everyone to a New Year's Eve worship service,
[909.62 --> 915.20]  and so next week, Saturday, December 31st is New Year's Eve, and we're going to have a worship
[915.20 --> 922.50]  service here at 6 p.m. So 6 p.m. for a worship service on New Year's Eve, and then the following
[922.50 --> 930.00]  Sunday, New Year's Day, we'll have our regularly scheduled 10 o'clock service together. I think that's
[930.00 --> 934.44]  it for our announcements, and so I'm going to hand it back to the team, and they're going to lead us
[934.44 --> 946.78]  in our first liturgy and some songs. Advent is a season of waiting, waiting for light in the darkness,
[947.86 --> 952.84]  waiting to be filled while empty, waiting for the return of the King.
[952.84 --> 965.40]  But Christmas has come. The Christ child has arrived. And we know he will come again. His first coming,
[965.58 --> 972.42]  though heralded by angels and witnessed by shepherds, was missed by most people. His second
[972.42 --> 980.26]  Advent will not be missed by anyone. This year, as we say Merry Christmas, we also say,
[980.26 --> 988.74]  Maranatha, come quickly, Lord Jesus. You'll notice this morning in some of our worship songs that we
[988.74 --> 995.14]  have a different language and the words of the lyrics of those songs up on the screen as well. So if
[995.14 --> 1002.56]  that is a language that you know, we encourage you to sing along in that language. Please stand as we sing.
[1010.26 --> 1038.12]  Joy to the Lord, the Lord is God. Let earth be seen our King. Let every heart prepare Him through, and
[1038.12 --> 1048.92]  save the Lord come. Let live in 예�半 parts of the hmm. Let every heart prepare Him through, and
[1048.92 --> 1058.08]  will its head be seen Malcolm himself as well as moods, he says. Mjatara, come quickly,ク Huffman
[1058.08 --> 1071.08]  Joy to the world the Savior is, Let all his walls have gone.
[1071.08 --> 1078.08]  While fields and crowds, Rocks, hills and plains,
[1078.08 --> 1085.08]  We feed the sounding joy, We feed the sounding joy.
[1085.08 --> 1094.08]  We feed the sounding joy,
[1094.08 --> 1103.08]  Joy to the world the Savior is, Let all the flowing bread,
[1103.08 --> 1107.08]  Though all tough can stand.
[1107.08 --> 1112.08]  Joy, drink of all joy,
[1112.08 --> 1116.08]  Rise within my soul,
[1116.08 --> 1119.08]  Never lets me go.
[1119.08 --> 1134.08]  He rules the world with truth and grace, And makes the nations prove.
[1134.08 --> 1149.08]  The glories of his righteousness, And wonders of his heart, And wonders of his heart,
[1149.08 --> 1154.06]  Berks
[1154.08 --> 1159.08]  And Wil 장난 of his life, Deal not all that favor Hasn't пад.
[1159.08 --> 1161.84]  Now earth is just one I know teasing.
[1161.84 --> 1167.08]  Up the aroma of God, The glory of knowing bread,
[1167.08 --> 1168.08]  Do no time can tangle
[1168.08 --> 1171.70]  No time can tell
[1171.70 --> 1177.34]  Joy, speak of all joy
[1177.34 --> 1181.92]  It rises in my soul
[1181.92 --> 1185.24]  You never rest in my heart
[1185.24 --> 1191.26]  Joy, speak of all joy
[1191.26 --> 1195.08]  Overflowing well
[1195.08 --> 1199.52]  No time can tell
[1199.52 --> 1205.08]  Joy, speak of all joy
[1205.08 --> 1209.08]  It rises in my soul
[1209.08 --> 1213.08]  You never rest in my heart
[1213.08 --> 1216.42]  I love you

[1276.42 --> 1282.42]  O come, O come to Bethlehem
[1282.42 --> 1289.42]  Thou that behold
[1289.42 --> 1294.42]  O'er the King of Ages

[1344.18 --> 1357.18]  O come, let us adore him. O come, let us adore him in Christ the Lord.

[1392.16 --> 1396.10]  Oh, come let us adore him.
[1396.10 --> 1396.68]  Amen.
[1396.68 --> 1426.66]  On Christmas Day, we gather really with Christians around the world celebrating Jesus coming to earth on our behalf to live the life we should have lived and eventually to die the death that we all deserve.
[1427.20 --> 1431.82]  And in our worship, we sing, come let us adore him.
[1432.26 --> 1437.72]  We gather here because God is in this place and he welcomes us and he greets us.
[1437.72 --> 1444.72]  And so I invite you to take a posture of receipt, whatever that looks like for you in your heart and receive the greeting of God.
[1446.34 --> 1455.46]  Grace, mercy and peace to you from God, our father, from his son, the Lord Jesus Christ, born on Christmas Day.

[1461.54 --> 1465.88]  I'm going to invite you to turn to those around you and to welcome them into worship.
[1466.32 --> 1472.06]  You can do that by shaking hands or by giving a fist pump or by nodding if they're not really interested in shaking your hands.

[2581.72 --> 2611.70]  Thank you.
[2611.72 --> 2641.70]  Thank you.
[2641.72 --> 2671.70]  Thank you.
[2671.72 --> 2701.70]  Thank you.
[2701.72 --> 2731.70]  Thank you.
[2731.72 --> 2761.70]  Thank you.
[2761.72 --> 2791.70]  Thank you.
[2791.72 --> 2821.70]  Thank you.
[2821.72 --> 2851.70]  Thank you.
[2851.72 --> 2881.70]  Thank you.
[2881.72 --> 2911.70]  Thank you.
[2911.72 --> 2941.72]  Thank you.
[2941.72 --> 2971.70]  Thank you.
[2971.70 --> 3001.68]  Thank you.
[3001.68 --> 3031.66]  Thank you.
[3031.66 --> 3061.66]  Thank you.
[3061.66 --> 3091.64]  Thank you.
[3091.66 --> 3121.66]  And so,
[3121.66 --> 3151.64]  and you're in the
[3151.64 --> 3181.62]  light, you're in the
[3181.62 --> 3211.60]  coming right, you're in the
[3211.60 --> 3241.58]  When they're in the
[3241.58 --> 3271.56]  The other light, you're in the
[3271.56 --> 3301.54]  run and you're in the
[3301.54 --> 3331.52]  This sun.
[3331.52 --> 3361.50]  All who come in the sky, you're in the
[3361.50 --> 3391.48]  The end.
[3391.48 --> 3421.46]  And you're in the light of the world.
[3421.46 --> 3451.44]  Thank you, God, thank you.
[3451.44 --> 3481.44]  Good morning, you're in the
[3481.44 --> 3511.42]  and you're in the sky, you're in the
[3511.86 --> 3513.52]  and you're in the sky, you're in the low wind, and thank you.
[3513.52 --> 3518.40]  And thank you, I'm in the middle of the stairs, and you're in the edge of the circus, and you're in the sky, and you're in the sans They're in the sky, and you're in theים.
[3518.40 --> 3527.04]  Dear Jesus, incarnate Christ, Emmanuel, God with us,
[3527.92 --> 3531.24]  though centuries have passed since your incarnation and birth,
[3531.48 --> 3537.00]  we echo the words of the fourth century poet Prudentius in his work of the Father's love begotten,
[3537.42 --> 3538.16]  when he writes,
[3538.92 --> 3540.56]  O that birth forever blessed,
[3541.28 --> 3546.80]  when the Virgin full of grace by the Holy Ghost conceiving for the Savior of our race,
[3546.80 --> 3553.66]  and the babe, the world's Redeemer, first revealed his sacred face evermore and evermore.
[3554.88 --> 3557.38]  Your birth is the greatest Christmas gift.
[3558.54 --> 3561.36]  Because of your birth, we have hope and joy,
[3562.10 --> 3565.22]  knowing that you are faithful to your covenantal promises.
[3566.74 --> 3571.88]  Because of your birth, we have a Savior who knows our weaknesses and struggles.
[3571.88 --> 3579.52]  Because of your birth, we have become part of a different, better story as your adopted children.
[3580.68 --> 3584.92]  Because of your birth, we are no longer slaves to sin and death.
[3585.60 --> 3588.68]  Rather, we are free to serve and love.
[3589.78 --> 3593.12]  Because of your birth, we have peace and love.
[3593.12 --> 3599.34]  And yet, we wait in this already-not-yet world,
[3599.76 --> 3602.50]  where we still mourn the loss of loved ones,
[3603.12 --> 3604.88]  particularly on days like today.
[3606.12 --> 3610.54]  Where we still grieve injustices around the world and in our neighborhoods.
[3611.48 --> 3614.86]  Where we still experience sickness and pain.
[3614.86 --> 3618.88]  And where we still often accept the world's story,
[3619.78 --> 3625.44]  attempting to satisfy our heart's desire with lesser lights than you, the light of the world.
[3627.22 --> 3632.16]  Strengthen our faith, opening our eyes to the true beauty of your truth.
[3633.00 --> 3637.96]  And comfort our hearts with your presence and your promises yet to be fulfilled.
[3637.96 --> 3641.74]  O ye heights of heaven, adore him.
[3642.32 --> 3644.34]  Angel hosts, his praises sing.
[3645.02 --> 3647.20]  Powers, dominions, bow before him.
[3647.64 --> 3649.54]  And extol our God and King.
[3650.26 --> 3652.28]  Let no tongue on earth be silent.
[3652.88 --> 3654.64]  Every voice in concert sing.
[3655.28 --> 3657.08]  Evermore and evermore.
[3659.10 --> 3662.10]  While our world is yet filled with the rage of nations,
[3662.78 --> 3666.56]  your birth has inaugurated a new everlasting kingdom.
[3666.56 --> 3669.92]  As citizens of this divine kingdom,
[3670.48 --> 3675.78]  we know that your power is made perfect in weakness, service, and humility.
[3676.92 --> 3681.54]  May we adore you and praise you by being your body here on earth.
[3682.46 --> 3686.10]  Loving you wholeheartedly and loving others without measure.
[3687.38 --> 3691.16]  May we share the good news of your birth and redemptive work.
[3691.16 --> 3697.56]  May we be a community of believers that is salt and light in a world that needs you so deeply.
[3699.32 --> 3708.62]  Sustain us by your spirit as we strive to bring the hope, joy, peace, and love of your incarnation to the world.
[3708.62 --> 3712.58]  Christ to thee with God the Father,
[3713.30 --> 3715.06]  and O Holy Ghost to thee,
[3715.78 --> 3720.18]  hymn and chant with high thanksgiving and unwearied praises be.
[3721.10 --> 3726.68]  Honor, glory, and dominion, and eternal victory evermore and evermore.
[3726.68 --> 3731.00]  We eagerly await your return, our glorious King.
[3731.58 --> 3733.32]  Come again soon, Lord Jesus.
[3734.36 --> 3734.70]  Amen.
[3734.70 --> 3734.80]  Amen.

[3785.56 --> 3785.64]  Amen.
[3785.88 --> 3786.56]  Amen.
[3786.56 --> 3796.94]  as we get there. Before we get into this text, let me start with a story. When I was younger,
[3797.36 --> 3806.20]  a kid, one of my favorite movies, and that is still full of nostalgia and memory for me,
[3806.20 --> 3814.36]  is the story or the movie called The Never-Ending Story. Now, if you were born in the 80s,
[3814.36 --> 3820.54]  you might know it. If you weren't, you might not have any idea who that was or what movie that was
[3820.54 --> 3827.82]  because it seemed to disappear for a little while. But it's about a boy who finds a magical book,
[3828.20 --> 3837.14]  and as he begins to read this story, hiding in the attic space of a building, we shift perspectives
[3837.14 --> 3844.34]  into that story. And then every once in a while, you bounce out of the story he's reading back to
[3844.36 --> 3849.96]  the boy in the main drama, and there's a storm that's happening that seems to parallel, a storm
[3849.96 --> 3857.96]  that's happening in the story that he's reading. And as you go through the movie, what you begin to
[3857.96 --> 3868.46]  realize is that his reading of the book and his participation in its reading is creating the world
[3868.46 --> 3876.38]  as he's going. And he has to, at the end, call out the name of the princess in order to save the world
[3876.38 --> 3885.94]  inside of the never-ending story. It's this beautiful, like, story within a story. Now, if you haven't seen
[3885.94 --> 3892.06]  it, I do entirely recommend it, but I do warn you, it is like 80s stereotypical storytelling.
[3892.06 --> 3902.26]  But this type of story is called a nested story, or sometimes it's called an embedded story, or a
[3902.26 --> 3909.68]  frame story. Maybe you're familiar with another famous 80s film, The Princess Bride. Same sort of
[3909.68 --> 3917.60]  idea, right, where Peter Falk reads a version of the story to Fred Savage, his grandson's character.
[3917.60 --> 3926.40]  If you're more literary in your life, the story of the Grand Inquisitor within Dostoyevsky's
[3926.40 --> 3935.34]  Brothers Karamazov is another frame story. Now, I introduce this because I want us today to think
[3935.34 --> 3947.48]  of the Christmas story as three stories nested together that forms one grand story. Now, the image
[3947.48 --> 3953.46]  I'm going to use for us, and we can put it on screen, is that of nesting dolls. Maybe you're familiar
[3953.46 --> 3958.50]  with Russian nesting dolls, where the littlest one fits inside the next one, which fits inside the next
[3958.50 --> 3969.38]  one. That's how I want us today to think of the Christmas story. Because the reality is, right, in our
[3969.38 --> 3976.66]  world, we can so easily focus on the first doll, which, fittingly, on the baby Jesus story,
[3976.66 --> 3985.78]  and we become, like, I can't remember his name all of a sudden, Talladega Nights, right, who just loves
[3985.78 --> 3992.54]  the baby Jesus, doesn't want to hear anything else other than the baby Jesus, right? And that's all we
[3992.54 --> 4001.06]  ever think about. We miss out on the context of where it's going or how we got there. Now, before we get
[4001.06 --> 4007.72]  into this, let me clear the air, don't hear what I'm not saying, right? Each aspect of this story is
[4007.72 --> 4015.58]  individually important, and it's just as important as the next and the one to follow. But what I hope
[4015.58 --> 4027.00]  we can see is that the sum of the grander story, or the sum of the parts, is grander than each doll
[4027.00 --> 4034.68]  on its own, and that the grandeur, now, of each part of the story is made all the more magnificent
[4034.68 --> 4044.00]  when we see it in relationship to the doll that it nests within. The first part of this Christmas story
[4044.00 --> 4052.92]  is the littlest doll in our image. It's the birth of baby Jesus in Bethlehem. Now, the Bible tells us
[4052.92 --> 4060.16]  this story in a few places. The one we're going to read is from Matthew 1, and I'll read 18 to 25.
[4063.04 --> 4070.84]  This is how the birth of Jesus, the Messiah, came about. His mother Mary was pledged to be married to
[4070.84 --> 4076.42]  Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit.
[4077.60 --> 4082.72]  Because Joseph, her husband, was faithful to the law and yet did not want to expose her to
[4082.72 --> 4089.46]  public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly. But after he had considered this,
[4089.58 --> 4092.54]  an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said,
[4092.72 --> 4100.06]  Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived
[4100.06 --> 4106.40]  in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus,
[4106.40 --> 4114.24]  because he will save his people from all their sins. All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had
[4114.24 --> 4119.78]  said through the prophet. The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him
[4119.78 --> 4128.48]  Emmanuel, which means God with us. When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him,
[4128.50 --> 4134.30]  and he took Mary home as his wife. But he did not consummate their marriage until she gave birth to a son,
[4134.30 --> 4139.12]  and he gave him the name Jesus. This is the word of the Lord.
[4141.00 --> 4150.76]  Now, right from the beginning of this story, right, you can see how it's nested in a larger story.
[4151.62 --> 4156.16]  This is how the birth of Jesus the Messiah came about. Well, what's a Messiah?
[4156.16 --> 4162.32]  Right? She was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit. Well, who is this Holy Spirit?
[4163.36 --> 4169.18]  Right? Our questions of the story and of the reading help us see that there's more to the story
[4169.18 --> 4177.24]  than what's going on in the surface level. And this nested nature of the story continues
[4177.24 --> 4184.16]  as we read, all this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet.
[4185.70 --> 4192.10]  The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Emmanuel, which means
[4192.10 --> 4200.46]  God with us. And so you start to see it, right? Right? What's happening in this part of the story
[4200.46 --> 4207.40]  in Matthew 1 is part of a bigger story that so many people miss. And even back then, that so many
[4207.40 --> 4214.72]  missed what was happening. All this took place to fulfill what the prophet had said. Matthew is telling
[4214.72 --> 4222.56]  us about the prophet Isaiah. Isaiah is a prophet in Israel some 700 years before the time of Jesus. He is
[4222.56 --> 4228.34]  a prophet before the Israelites are carried away into exile by Babylon and the armies of Nebuchadnezzar.
[4228.34 --> 4234.80]  Isaiah is a prophet. Isaiah is a prophet. That means he speaks the word of God and reveals God's will to
[4234.80 --> 4242.34]  the people during the reigns of King Uzziah through King Hezekiah and may even still yet be alive in the
[4242.34 --> 4253.76]  reign of Manasseh. Now, just a little tidbit. In 2018, archaeologists working in Jerusalem found a clay
[4253.76 --> 4261.26]  bulla. A clay bulla is like a piece of clay with a carving in it. It's a stamp that's pushed into wax
[4261.26 --> 4270.46]  that's used as a seal to identify a writing or an object as belonging to someone. So they found a clay
[4270.46 --> 4279.86]  bulla in Israel that's inscribed with Isaiah the prophet. And they found that just like 10 feet away
[4279.86 --> 4288.62]  from where three years before they found a bulla, a fancier one, inscribed with belonging to King Hezekiah.
[4290.44 --> 4298.50]  And so the point is, right, that this is a story nested within a story, but it's also a true story.
[4299.22 --> 4305.28]  It's also history, right? It happened in the world. And so this is the true story of the whole world.
[4305.28 --> 4311.08]  So Isaiah writes, and remember, this is 700 years before Jesus. Isaiah writes, and you can look it up,
[4311.16 --> 4317.94]  chapter 7, verse 14, the Lord himself will give you a sign. The virgin will conceive and give birth to a
[4317.94 --> 4327.98]  son and will call him Emmanuel. And that's part of what so many people and what is so easy to miss
[4327.98 --> 4336.92]  in what Christmas has become in today's world. And for so many, the message of Christmas is about gifts
[4336.92 --> 4343.14]  or about Santa or Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer, right? It's about Hallmark Christmas movies and
[4343.14 --> 4349.80]  chestnuts roasting on an open fire. And really, to be candid with you, it's not just about these cliche
[4349.80 --> 4355.86]  things, right? But it's also become about things that are otherwise really good, right? Things that are
[4355.86 --> 4364.84]  a part, by all accounts, a good part of our lives and the world, right? So for many of us, Christmas is
[4364.84 --> 4371.54]  all about family, right? It's all about connecting with people. Christmas can be about resting from the
[4371.54 --> 4377.96]  hustle and bustle of a workaday life and taking a break, taking some time out of the ordinary busyness
[4377.96 --> 4382.78]  of life to be with those people whom you love, to remember those people whom you have lost,
[4382.78 --> 4387.52]  and to dwell in the moment of blessing. All of this, right, is good.
[4389.92 --> 4398.34]  But if that's what Christmas is all about, you are missing the nested nature of the Christmas story.
[4399.22 --> 4405.40]  You're missing the nested nature of what's really going on. Because better than all of those good
[4405.40 --> 4410.02]  things, better than the best chocolate you may have got, better than the best gift you may have
[4410.02 --> 4418.82]  received, better than the best family reunion you have ever experienced, no matter what it may be,
[4418.96 --> 4426.78]  better than all of those things is the truth of Emmanuel, God with us.
[4426.78 --> 4436.20]  Because the eyes of our heart, because the focus of our attention this time of year can be so much on
[4436.20 --> 4444.66]  other things, we miss the majesty of the God-man. We miss the miracle of the infinite somehow becoming
[4444.66 --> 4452.02]  finite. We miss the impossible yet made possible of the transcendent becoming imminent, of God taking on
[4452.02 --> 4460.34]  flesh and making his dwelling among us. We miss the truth of God coming as a baby in the manger, heralded by angels,
[4460.48 --> 4470.34]  but missed by so many other people. Emmanuel, God with us. That's the Christmas story we don't want you to miss again
[4470.34 --> 4480.28]  this year. And that story is actually nested in the grander story, right? Because God with us begs the question,
[4481.48 --> 4491.04]  why? Why does he have to come with us? Matthew gets us started in this direction in verse 21 when he writes,
[4491.04 --> 4498.48]  He will give birth to a son and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.
[4499.52 --> 4509.04]  You see, the Christmas story is a story of Emmanuel, of God with us to save us from our sins. And so if you
[4509.04 --> 4514.34]  want to understand this Christmas story right, you actually have to go right back to the beginning,
[4514.34 --> 4522.40]  right? To understand another example of God with us, you have to go right back to the story of the
[4522.40 --> 4530.08]  creation and the rebellion of Adam and Eve in the garden against God. Now, I'm not going to read all
[4530.08 --> 4534.20]  of it for you, but I'm going to summarize it quickly and a bunch of it will be on the screen as we go.
[4535.06 --> 4540.40]  Genesis 1 starts, very first words of the Bible, in the beginning God created the heavens
[4540.40 --> 4545.84]  and the earth. And then we get day after day of the creation story where there is light and there
[4545.84 --> 4551.72]  is waters, there is land that is gathered up and lights given to govern the land and lights given
[4551.72 --> 4557.78]  to, lights given to govern the day and lights given to govern the night. And then the water creatures
[4557.78 --> 4563.80]  and the birds are created and land that is producing living creatures, each according to its kind. And
[4563.80 --> 4573.90]  then the capstone on day six of creation is humanity. And in Genesis 1 26, God says, let us make mankind in
[4573.90 --> 4580.52]  our image, in our likeness, so they may rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the
[4580.52 --> 4586.52]  livestock and all the wild animals and over all the creatures that move along the ground. So God created
[4586.52 --> 4594.84]  mankind in his own image, in the image of God, he created them male and female, he created them.
[4596.34 --> 4605.74]  Not only is the story of creation a story of God with us, but it is a story of us with God.
[4606.28 --> 4613.60]  It is a story of us created to be like God in his image. It is a story of God's presence among us,
[4613.60 --> 4619.26]  giving us purpose and meaning and grounding us in something bigger than ourselves. It is a story
[4619.26 --> 4626.20]  of our relationship to God being the source of our wholeness and our peace, our shalom in the world.
[4626.86 --> 4634.26]  It is a story of God living in perfect communion with humanity in the world he created and called good.
[4635.76 --> 4642.54]  And it is a story of our rebellion against God, of humanity sinning against our creator,
[4642.54 --> 4648.92]  in Genesis 3, again the story continues, you can read how the serpent comes along and tempts
[4648.92 --> 4653.50]  the woman and she tempts the man and then God speaks the word of judgment over them all. But
[4653.50 --> 4658.68]  there's this beautiful line in Genesis 3 verse 8 where we can read,
[4658.88 --> 4663.84]  the man and his wife heard the sound of the Lord as he was walking in the garden in the cool
[4663.84 --> 4673.42]  of the day. This is a picture of God with us, a picture of God walking among us in the garden,
[4673.56 --> 4683.10]  a picture of perfect shalom and our sin wrecked it. God with Adam and Eve walking in the garden and they
[4683.10 --> 4691.44]  hid because of their shame. But even in that moment of judgment, if you remember the story,
[4691.44 --> 4695.90]  right, even though they were kicked out of the garden, the man and the woman and the serpent
[4695.90 --> 4701.90]  were all cursed to one degree or another. Even in that moment, there is a promise of grace.
[4702.96 --> 4708.46]  God said to the serpent in Genesis 3 verse 15, he said, I will put enmity between you and the woman
[4708.46 --> 4715.10]  in between your offspring and hers. He will crush your head and you will strike his heel.
[4715.10 --> 4723.64]  In biblical theology, this verse, Genesis 3 verse 15 is called the first gospel. It is the first
[4723.64 --> 4730.92]  promise of Jesus, of Emmanuel. The promise that would be reiterated through Isaiah. The promise
[4730.92 --> 4736.18]  that would be spoken again and again and again throughout the entire story of the Old Testament
[4736.18 --> 4745.30]  and a promise that finds its fulfillment in Jesus. Because the first part of the story,
[4745.96 --> 4753.04]  the littlest doll, is nested within the larger part of this story, we begin to see how the promise
[4753.04 --> 4760.50]  of salvation through Emmanuel comes to be necessary, but also how it comes to find its fulfillment
[4760.50 --> 4770.40]  fulfillment in Jesus. We also begin to see that the baby Jesus in a manger isn't enough for the story
[4770.40 --> 4777.92]  to be effective, right? That is for the serpent to be crushed, for sin to be defeated, for Christmas to
[4777.92 --> 4785.00]  have a purpose beyond angels singing and our gift giving. This baby needs to grow into a man,
[4785.00 --> 4791.36]  and this man somehow needs to keep the law of God perfectly and somehow in our place and on our behalf
[4791.36 --> 4799.88]  grant us his righteousness. We daily prove that we cannot do it, but he must do it. But even that's
[4799.88 --> 4805.32]  right, only half of the bigger story, the half of the story of salvation, because even though he was
[4805.32 --> 4812.42]  perfect, the penalty and punishment for our sins still need to be paid. And this baby who grows into a man
[4812.42 --> 4822.40]  who lived the perfect life will offer himself to die, innocent for the guilty, perfect for the depraved.
[4823.00 --> 4832.54]  And that only makes sense when we nest the story of the first doll into the larger doll of creation
[4832.54 --> 4839.78]  and our rebellion against God and sin. That only makes sense when we know the truth that the wages of sin
[4839.78 --> 4846.16]  is death and that the just response of God to our sin is death and condemnation.
[4848.16 --> 4849.22]  And yet,
[4850.32 --> 4853.50]  and yet,
[4853.90 --> 4856.46]  and yet,
[4856.52 --> 4861.86]  those two little words, and yet may be the best words you hear this Christmas.
[4862.80 --> 4863.54]  And yet,
[4863.76 --> 4868.28]  because Jesus lived the life I should have lived and died the death that I deserved,
[4868.28 --> 4868.72]  and yet,
[4868.72 --> 4876.76]  because Jesus was raised three days later, victorious over sin and death, because Jesus is with us,
[4877.20 --> 4878.28]  God with us,
[4878.42 --> 4878.86]  Emmanuel,
[4879.18 --> 4882.58]  because God is with us and will be with us,
[4882.80 --> 4884.30]  because of Jesus,
[4884.86 --> 4885.14]  you,
[4885.62 --> 4885.90]  me,
[4886.06 --> 4886.72]  and we,
[4887.06 --> 4888.56]  by grace through faith,
[4888.64 --> 4891.62]  can again be with God.
[4891.76 --> 4894.08]  This is the gift of God at Christmas.
[4894.08 --> 4897.26]  This is the gift of Emmanuel once again,
[4897.36 --> 4900.06]  and this is the gift that keeps on giving,
[4900.18 --> 4903.28]  because there's still another layer into this story.
[4903.40 --> 4907.38]  There's still another doll in which those first two are still nested.
[4909.58 --> 4913.56]  If you've been with us here at Emmanuel through Advent and Christmas,
[4914.22 --> 4918.76]  our church has been looking at different stories from the book of Revelation,
[4918.76 --> 4923.64]  trying to stir our affections for the return of the King.
[4924.54 --> 4928.32]  And as we look today at the story of Emmanuel,
[4928.72 --> 4929.68]  God with us,
[4930.10 --> 4933.18]  let's read the end of this story.
[4934.04 --> 4935.84]  For just as there was a first Advent,
[4936.24 --> 4937.02]  a first coming,
[4937.28 --> 4939.00]  there will be a second Advent,
[4939.20 --> 4940.92]  a second coming of Jesus.
[4941.10 --> 4942.34]  And when that happens,
[4942.70 --> 4945.10]  listen to how that will be
[4945.10 --> 4947.80]  from Revelation 21.
[4951.10 --> 4952.18]  Revelation 21,
[4952.36 --> 4953.78]  verse 1 through 5.
[4954.78 --> 4957.70]  Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth,
[4958.18 --> 4961.18]  for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away,
[4961.40 --> 4963.50]  and there was no longer any sea.
[4964.66 --> 4966.26]  I saw the holy city,
[4966.38 --> 4967.20]  the new Jerusalem,
[4967.40 --> 4969.04]  coming down out of heaven from God,
[4969.16 --> 4970.26]  prepared as a bride,
[4970.66 --> 4972.20]  beautifully dressed for her husband.
[4972.20 --> 4975.48]  And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying,
[4975.88 --> 4980.28]  Look, God's dwelling place is now among the people,
[4980.64 --> 4982.60]  and He will dwell with them.
[4983.60 --> 4984.80]  They will be His people,
[4984.98 --> 4988.66]  and God Himself will be with them and be their God.
[4989.34 --> 4992.04]  He will wipe away every tear from their eyes,
[4992.20 --> 4995.36]  and there will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain,
[4995.46 --> 4997.86]  for the old order of things has passed away.
[4997.86 --> 5001.42]  He who was seated on the throne said,
[5001.78 --> 5003.82]  I am making everything new.
[5004.74 --> 5005.30]  And then He said,
[5005.40 --> 5006.24]  Write this down,
[5006.34 --> 5009.66]  for these words are trustworthy and true.
[5013.58 --> 5014.50]  John writes,
[5014.58 --> 5016.72]  I heard a loud voice from the throne saying,
[5016.92 --> 5020.96]  Look, God's dwelling place is now among the people,
[5021.20 --> 5022.72]  and He will dwell with them.
[5022.72 --> 5024.20]  They will be His people,
[5024.40 --> 5029.22]  and God Himself will be with them and be their God.
[5029.88 --> 5036.00]  The nested story of Christmas is about so much more than a baby called Emmanuel.
[5036.22 --> 5038.30]  It is about God called Emmanuel,
[5038.52 --> 5041.72]  who walked among His creation and His people in the beginning,
[5041.90 --> 5044.00]  and though they rebelled against Him,
[5044.06 --> 5047.78]  He will walk among them again as Emmanuel at Christmas,
[5047.78 --> 5054.58]  and will yet again dwell among us as Emmanuel at the end of days.
[5054.64 --> 5058.10]  This is the full hope of Christmas.
[5058.90 --> 5060.92]  And our hearts are hungry.
[5061.72 --> 5065.14]  You might even say that the world is haunted.
[5066.28 --> 5067.56]  And what we are hungry for,
[5067.62 --> 5070.20]  what our souls are longing for,
[5070.28 --> 5072.16]  is God with us.
[5072.16 --> 5077.16]  He will wipe away every tear from their eyes,
[5077.20 --> 5080.08]  and there will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain,
[5080.20 --> 5083.22]  for the old order of things has passed away.
[5083.52 --> 5086.22]  This is the grander story,
[5086.36 --> 5090.68]  this story of Christmas that includes the end and the beginning,
[5090.96 --> 5095.06]  the story of Christmas that, yes, starts with Jesus in a manger,
[5095.18 --> 5098.26]  but is the fulfillment of a promise given at creation,
[5098.26 --> 5102.14]  and will yet be fulfilled at the end of history.
[5102.76 --> 5108.48]  The Christmas story is three stories nested together to form one grand story,
[5108.60 --> 5113.90]  and I pray, I pray that you will make that your story this Christmas.
[5116.22 --> 5117.40]  And if you do,
[5118.90 --> 5120.38]  if you do,
[5121.82 --> 5122.30]  oh boy,
[5122.68 --> 5126.06]  that changes everything.
[5126.06 --> 5132.66]  The truth of Christmas being God's climactic answer to sin in the world,
[5132.90 --> 5134.34]  a world that He created,
[5134.92 --> 5138.70]  and for the purpose of us being in perfect shalom,
[5138.92 --> 5140.22]  fellowship, communion with Him,
[5140.52 --> 5146.00]  a story that doesn't end until He returns and restores all things,
[5146.32 --> 5148.96]  this truth changes everything,
[5149.08 --> 5150.26]  not just about the future,
[5150.50 --> 5152.66]  but about your life right now,
[5153.52 --> 5154.80]  in this moment.
[5154.80 --> 5159.96]  Not only are we saved from sin and restored in relationship to God,
[5160.20 --> 5162.84]  which alone is enough to want to sing His praises.
[5164.66 --> 5165.06]  Amen?
[5166.46 --> 5168.00]  Oh, you guys are going to get there with me.
[5168.06 --> 5168.86]  We're going to do it today, okay?
[5171.70 --> 5173.84]  Even that is enough to sing His praises.
[5174.58 --> 5177.84]  But, because this story changes everything right now,
[5177.84 --> 5181.12]  it also changes what you do and how you do it.
[5181.18 --> 5182.98]  And so, even now,
[5183.40 --> 5185.24]  doing natural sciences
[5185.24 --> 5188.52]  is imbued with a new and a glorious meaning.
[5189.20 --> 5189.72]  Even now,
[5189.86 --> 5192.26]  studying at university is for the glory of God
[5192.26 --> 5194.02]  and for the revealing of His kingdom
[5194.02 --> 5197.22]  and celebration of what God is doing in the world.
[5197.54 --> 5198.20]  Even now,
[5198.36 --> 5202.02]  writing code and designing the next leap in computer technology,
[5202.02 --> 5207.88]  is changed when you see it as part of this grand story.
[5208.92 --> 5211.02]  Growing plants and flowers,
[5211.46 --> 5214.26]  cultivating the garden that is God's good creation,
[5214.42 --> 5216.82]  is an act of kingdom service.
[5218.02 --> 5219.48]  Even now,
[5219.62 --> 5221.46]  your story is changed.
[5221.46 --> 5223.54]  The truth is,
[5224.02 --> 5227.28]  this nested Christmas story
[5227.28 --> 5230.18]  that encapsulates the very beginning
[5230.18 --> 5231.84]  all the way to the very end,
[5232.14 --> 5235.92]  this Christmas story changes everything.
[5237.68 --> 5241.88]  But only if you know it as part of the grander story.
[5243.72 --> 5246.60]  And only if you find your place within it.
[5247.62 --> 5248.44]  And so, this Christmas,
[5248.64 --> 5250.30]  I pray you find your place
[5250.30 --> 5252.22]  in the grander story.
[5252.36 --> 5253.78]  And that in the grander story,
[5253.94 --> 5255.20]  you might see
[5255.20 --> 5256.68]  the grandeur
[5256.68 --> 5258.36]  of Jesus.
[5259.20 --> 5259.52]  Amen?
[5260.60 --> 5261.16]  Amen.
[5261.66 --> 5262.40]  Let's pray together.
[5267.26 --> 5268.20]  Lord our God,
[5268.30 --> 5270.72]  you are so good
[5270.72 --> 5271.60]  to us.
[5272.70 --> 5273.92]  May we see you,
[5274.16 --> 5275.00]  God Emmanuel,
[5275.58 --> 5276.68]  God with us
[5276.68 --> 5279.08]  in the face of Jesus today.
[5279.08 --> 5280.50]  and may our hearts'
[5281.14 --> 5282.56]  longings be stirred
[5282.56 --> 5284.40]  as we wait for the day
[5284.40 --> 5285.70]  of your great return.
[5286.48 --> 5287.24]  And until then,
[5287.42 --> 5287.80]  Lord God,
[5287.90 --> 5289.08]  may every aspect
[5289.08 --> 5290.22]  of who we are
[5290.22 --> 5291.08]  and what we do
[5291.08 --> 5292.74]  be lived for you,
[5293.06 --> 5294.16]  lived out of this
[5294.16 --> 5295.04]  great,
[5295.44 --> 5296.78]  grand story.
[5298.18 --> 5299.14]  In you,
[5299.42 --> 5300.16]  Lord God,
[5300.30 --> 5302.64]  we find our purpose.
[5303.38 --> 5304.08]  In you,
[5304.30 --> 5305.08]  Lord Jesus,
[5305.30 --> 5307.38]  we find our hope.
[5307.38 --> 5308.90]  in you,
[5309.12 --> 5309.82]  Lord Jesus,
[5309.82 --> 5311.44]  we come to know
[5311.44 --> 5313.22]  a new family.
[5314.50 --> 5316.36]  You are the true
[5316.36 --> 5317.54]  and better gift
[5317.54 --> 5319.22]  and you have given us
[5319.22 --> 5320.86]  a new family,
[5321.00 --> 5322.14]  the bride of Christ,
[5322.28 --> 5323.84]  the church of Jesus,
[5324.22 --> 5326.84]  the family of God.
[5328.12 --> 5329.94]  As part of this family,
[5330.06 --> 5331.24]  by grace through faith,
[5331.42 --> 5332.58]  we sing your praises
[5332.58 --> 5333.54]  and we live
[5333.54 --> 5336.20]  in praise of you.
[5337.62 --> 5338.38]  Grant us that
[5338.38 --> 5339.20]  this Christmas.
[5339.64 --> 5340.38]  Open our eyes
[5340.38 --> 5341.12]  to the truth
[5341.12 --> 5342.48]  of who you are.
[5342.60 --> 5343.54]  In Jesus' name
[5343.54 --> 5344.06]  we pray.
[5345.06 --> 5345.44]  Amen.
[5345.44 --> 5345.54]  Amen.
[5354.92 --> 5355.94]  Please stand
[5355.94 --> 5356.56]  as we sing
[5356.56 --> 5357.46]  Almost Home.
[5357.46 --> 5383.78]  Don't want to sing
[5383.78 --> 5391.96]  H walked in the lake, we're almost home, through every toilet danger, we're almost home.
[5391.96 --> 5400.56]  How many pilgrim saints have before us gone, no stopping now, we're almost home.
[5400.56 --> 5409.18]  The promised land is dying, we're almost home
[5409.18 --> 5414.18]  And not a tear shall fall, then we're almost home
[5414.18 --> 5418.02]  Make merry, mail yourselves for the kingdom
[5418.02 --> 5423.02]  Don't turn it back, we're almost home
[5423.02 --> 5429.22]  Almost home, we're almost home
[5429.22 --> 5433.84]  So kiss our joy, the blessed shore, we're almost home
[5433.84 --> 5436.94]  We're almost home
[5436.94 --> 5445.20]  This journey ours together, we're almost home
[5445.20 --> 5450.28]  Unto the great forever, we're almost home
[5450.28 --> 5455.38]  One song as new we'll sing from that happy's home
[5455.38 --> 5459.26]  Come feet apart, we're almost home
[5459.26 --> 5465.10]  Almost home, we're almost home
[5465.10 --> 5470.24]  So kiss our joy, the blessed shore, we're almost home
[5470.24 --> 5473.96]  We're almost home
[5473.96 --> 5481.74]  This land is just a baby, we're almost home
[5481.74 --> 5486.90]  The sun is setting yonder, we're almost home
[5486.90 --> 5492.12]  Take courage for this darkness, you'll breathe to die
[5492.12 --> 5496.00]  Oh, lift your eyes, we're almost home
[5496.00 --> 5501.84]  Almost home, we're almost home
[5501.84 --> 5507.24]  So kiss our joy, the blessed shore, oh praise the Lord
[5507.24 --> 5510.34]  We're almost home
[5510.34 --> 5530.10]  He became sick, who knew no sin
[5530.10 --> 5534.98]  That we might be home, his righteousness
[5534.98 --> 5544.14]  He humbled itself, and carried the cross
[5544.14 --> 5547.66]  Love so amazing
[5547.66 --> 5553.82]  Love so amazing
[5553.82 --> 5559.70]  Jesus, Messiah

[5705.58 --> 5711.58]  Jesus Messiah
[5711.58 --> 5716.58]  name above all names
[5716.58 --> 5721.58]  blessed Redeemer
[5721.58 --> 5727.58]  Emmanuel
[5727.58 --> 5731.58]  the rescue for sinners
[5731.58 --> 5738.58]  the ransom from heaven
[5738.58 --> 5744.58]  Jesus Messiah
[5744.58 --> 5746.58]  Lord of all
[5746.58 --> 5748.58]  Jesus Messiah
[5748.58 --> 5750.58]  Lord of all
[5750.58 --> 5752.58]  Jesus Messiah
[5752.58 --> 5754.58]  Lord of all
[5754.58 --> 5760.58]  Lord of all
[5760.58 --> 5764.58]  Lord of all
[5764.58 --> 5766.58]  Lord of all
[5766.58 --> 5770.58]  Lord of all
[5770.58 --> 5772.58]  Lord of all
[5772.58 --> 5785.58]  Lord of all
[5785.58 --> 5786.58]  Lord of all
[5786.58 --> 5788.58]  Lord of all
[5788.58 --> 5795.48]  and so please stick around for that, share some time, life, and story together. And then eventually
[5795.48 --> 5803.68]  for the TWU students and for those who are hosting, we will transition into our lunch together,
[5803.68 --> 5808.52]  but we're not rushing into any of that, and so please stick around and let us get to know you
[5808.52 --> 5818.34]  all a little bit. Before you go, receive the blessing of our God. May God go before you.
[5818.58 --> 5826.10]  To prepare a way for you. May God go behind you to protect you. May God go beneath you to support
[5826.10 --> 5834.18]  you, and may God himself in Jesus Emmanuel go beside you to befriend you. Do not be afraid.
[5834.58 --> 5841.74]  Let the blessing and peace of God come upon you this Christmas. Do not be afraid, but go in peace
[5841.74 --> 5845.74]  to love and serve the Lord. Amen.
[5845.74 --> 5845.90]  Amen.
[5845.90 --> 5852.22]  There's a Christmas tradition in our church that's reflective of some of the Dutch heritage
[5852.22 --> 5858.30]  that some of our members come from. It's to close the Christmas Day service with the next
[5858.30 --> 5864.58]  song called Glory to God, also known as Ere Se God. We will have the words on the screen behind
[5864.58 --> 5869.26]  us in both Dutch and English. We invite you and encourage you all to sing it in whatever
[5869.26 --> 5871.26]  language you feel most comfortable with.
[5871.26 --> 5872.26]  Any time?
[5872.26 --> 5881.26] It is okay.
[5881.26 --> 5886.84]  Oh, mercy, Lord . . . . verlier óse your sight
[5886.84 --> 5900.26]  in the highest, in the highest, in the highest, in the highest. The highest, in the high.
[5900.26 --> 5930.24]  Oh, Lord.
[5930.26 --> 5960.24]  Oh, Lord.
[5960.26 --> 5970.00]  He is the honouring to the people, to the people.

[6090.54 --> 6120.52]  Thank you.
[6120.54 --> 6150.52]  Thank you.
