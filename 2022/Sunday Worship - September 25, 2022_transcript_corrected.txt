[0.00 → 3.00] Where you lost your life, so...
[4.68 → 10.40] Every part designed in the work of art called love
[10.40 → 19.00] If you gladly chose surrender, so will I
[19.00 → 24.56] I can see your heart, it fills you differently
[24.56 → 32.92] Every precious one, a child you died to save
[32.92 → 39.68] If you gave your life to love them so loud
[39.68 → 48.28] Like you would again a hundred billion times
[48.28 → 55.28] But what measure could amount to your desire
[55.28 → 62.28] You're the one who never leaves the one behind
[62.28 → 76.40] I raise a hallelujah
[76.40 → 82.36] In the presence of my enemies

[112.36 → 117.36] Heaven comes to fight for me
[117.36 → 122.36] I'm going to sing
[122.36 → 125.36] In the middle of the storm
[125.36 → 128.36] Louder and louder
[128.36 → 131.36] You're going to hear my praising roar
[131.36 → 134.36] Up from the ashes
[134.36 → 137.36] Hope will arise
[137.36 → 140.36] Death is defeated
[140.36 → 146.36] The king is alive

[151.36 → 156.36] I raise a hallelujah
[156.36 → 161.36] With everything inside of me
[161.36 → 167.36] I raise a hallelujah
[167.36 → 173.36] I will watch the darkness flee
[173.36 → 174.36] I raise a hallelujah
[174.36 → 176.36] I raise a hallelujah
[176.36 → 180.36] I raise a hallelujah
[180.36 → 184.36] In the middle of the mystery
[184.36 → 186.36] I raise a hallelujah
[186.36 → 188.36] I raise a hallelujah
[188.36 → 190.36] I feel you lost your hold on me
[190.36 → 192.36] I'm going to sing
[192.36 → 195.36] I feel you lost your hold on me
[195.36 → 197.36] I'm going to sing
[197.36 → 199.36] In the middle of the storm
[199.36 → 201.36] I'm going to sing
[201.36 → 203.36] In the middle of the storm
[203.36 → 205.36] Louder and louder
[205.36 → 207.36] You're going to hear my praising roar
[207.36 → 209.36] Up from the ashes
[209.36 → 210.36] Hope will arise
[210.36 → 211.36] Hope will arise

[229.36 → 231.36] The king is alive
[231.36 → 232.36] The king is alive
[232.36 → 234.36] Sing a little louder
[234.36 → 237.70] Louder than the unbelief
[237.70 → 239.42] Sing a little louder
[239.42 → 243.16] My weapon is a melody
[243.16 → 245.36] Sing a little louder

[295.40 → 298.22] The king is alive
[298.22 → 304.62] Albans Monique
[304.84 → 307.60] Love you
[307.60 → 309.04] Anna
[309.04 → 310.88] Es dreaming
[313.10 → 314.16] Tinged
[314.16 → 342.94] We worship the God who was, we worship the God who is, we worship the God who evermore
[342.94 → 354.70] will be. He opened the prison door, he parted the raging sea, my God, he holds the victory.
[357.12 → 368.38] There's joy in the house of the Lord, there's joy in the house of the Lord today. And we won't be quiet, we shout out your praise.
[368.38 → 379.74] There's joy in the house of the Lord, our God is surely in this place. And we won't be quiet, we shout out your praise.
[379.74 → 399.74] We sing to the God who heals, we sing to the God who saves, we sing to the God who always makes a way.
[399.74 → 411.74] Because he hung up on that cross, then he rose up from that grave. My God's still Rolling Stones away.

[423.74 → 435.68] There's joy in the house of the Lord, our God is surely in this place. And we won't be quiet, we shout out your praise.
[435.68 → 437.68] We were the beggars.
[437.68 → 450.68] We were the beggars, now we're royalty. We were the prisoners, now we're running free.
[450.68 → 457.68] We are forgiven, we are forgiven. We are forgiven. We are forgiven, we're forgiven. Furthermore, we are forgiven, we are forgiven, we are forgiven, we are forgiven, we are forgiven.
[457.68 → 472.68] Let the house of the Lord sing praise. Because we were the beggars, now we're royalty. We were the prisoners, now we're running free.
[480.68 → 490.68] We are forgiven, we are forgiven, we are forgiven. We are forgiven, we are forgiven, we are forgiven.
[490.68 → 494.68] Well, there it is. Good morning everyone.
[494.68 → 495.68] Morning.
[495.68 → 498.68] Hey, we did it. We made it through the first few seconds.
[498.68 → 503.68] I've got a couple of announcements this morning. My name's Kevin Robert, I'm the youth pastor here.
[503.68 → 508.68] I've got a few announcements about ministries starting off this ministry year.

[727.68 → 729.68] Majestic in holiness.
[729.68 → 731.68] Awesome in glory.

[1020.82 → 1027.82] I'm desperate for you
[1027.82 → 1034.00] And I
[1034.00 → 1039.82] I'm lost without you

[1173.74 → 1175.54] The mystery of our faith
[1175.54 → 1177.10] And God's love for us
[1177.10 → 1178.56] That cannot be undone
[1178.56 → 1179.34] By our sin
[1179.34 → 1182.24] We trust in God's mercy
[1182.24 → 1183.06] And grace
[1183.06 → 1184.84] As we come to him now
[1184.84 → 1186.06] In a few moments
[1186.06 → 1187.24] Of silent prayer
[1187.24 → 1188.04] And confession
[1188.04 → 1189.42] Please pray with me
[1189.42 → 1219.40] You are the air I breathe
[1219.40 → 1234.74] Holy Lord, God of life, hear our prayer.
[1236.38 → 1240.02] Forgive us when we follow the paths that lead us away from you.
[1241.38 → 1244.88] Forgive us when we forget that you offer us life,
[1245.16 → 1247.22] life that is abundant and eternal,
[1247.22 → 1250.72] life that began at the creation of all things.
[1251.70 → 1254.42] Forgive us and turn our hearts to you.
[1256.26 → 1260.70] May your love and grace flow over us and through us
[1260.70 → 1263.68] as we strive to be your hands and feet in this world.
[1264.68 → 1267.76] Help us to be your willing servants as we serve others.
[1269.02 → 1272.98] We pray this in the name of Jesus and for his sake. Amen.
[1277.22 → 1291.22] Who else commands all the hosts of heaven?
[1291.22 → 1304.02] Who else commands all the hosts of heaven?
[1305.24 → 1310.14] Who else can make every king bow down?
[1310.14 → 1316.98] Who else can whisper and darkness trembles?
[1316.98 → 1322.00] Only a holy God
[1322.00 → 1328.76] What other beauty demands such praises?
[1330.38 → 1335.10] What other splendour outshines the sun?
[1335.10 → 1340.42] What other majesty rules with justice?
[1341.78 → 1346.82] Only a holy God
[1346.82 → 1353.30] Come and behold him
[1353.30 → 1357.84] The one and the only
[1357.84 → 1362.40] Cry out, sing holy
[1362.40 → 1366.84] Forever a holy God
[1366.84 → 1371.50] Come and worship the holy God
[1371.50 → 1386.52] What other glory consumes like fire?
[1386.52 → 1393.00] What other power can raise the dead?
[1393.00 → 1398.20] What other name remains undefeated?
[1398.20 → 1404.68] Only a holy God
[1404.68 → 1411.16] Come and behold him
[1411.16 → 1417.64] The one and the only
[1417.64 → 1419.64] Cry out, sing holy
[1419.64 → 1424.12] Forever a holy God
[1424.12 → 1426.12] Come and behold him
[1426.12 → 1429.12] Come and worship the holy God
[1429.12 → 1433.12] Come and behold him
[1433.12 → 1435.12] Come and behold him
[1435.12 → 1436.12] Come and behold him
[1436.12 → 1439.60] The one and the only
[1439.60 → 1441.60] And the only
[1441.60 → 1442.60] And the only
[1442.60 → 1446.08] Cry out, sing holy
[1446.08 → 1448.08] God
[1448.08 → 1449.52] Come and behold him
[1449.56 → 1451.02] And he of the trust essay
[1451.02 → 1452.36] The one and the only
[1452.36 → 1452.80] Come and Lord
[1452.80 → 1453.56] For holy God
[1453.56 → 1454.68] Come and behold him
[1454.68 → 1454.82] Come and behold him
[1454.82 → 1455.08] Come and behold him
[1455.08 → 1481.22] Who else could rescue me from my failing?
[1481.22 → 1487.22] Who else would offer his only Son?
[1487.22 → 1493.22] Who else invites me to call him Father?
[1493.22 → 1504.22] Only a holy God, only my holy God.
[1504.22 → 1515.22] Come and behold him, the one and the only.
[1515.22 → 1524.22] Cry out, sing holy, forever a holy God.
[1524.22 → 1531.22] Then worship a holy God.
[1531.22 → 1539.22] Come and behold him, the one and the only.
[1539.22 → 1550.22] Cry out, sing holy, forever a holy God.
[1550.22 → 1554.22] Come and worship a holy God.
[1554.22 → 1560.22] Come and worship a holy God.
[1560.22 → 1575.22] You need to stand for this one.
[1575.22 → 1581.22] You have to stand up for this one.
[1581.22 → 1604.22] I see the King of glory
[1604.22 → 1609.22] coming on the clouds with fire.
[1609.22 → 1617.22] The whole earth shakes, the whole earth shakes.
[1617.22 → 1623.22] I see his love and mercy
[1623.22 → 1628.22] washing over all our sin.
[1628.22 → 1635.22] The people sing, the people sing.
[1635.22 → 1647.22] Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest.
[1647.22 → 1660.22] Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest.
[1660.22 → 1664.22] Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest.
[1664.22 → 1665.22] I see, Sasha.
[1665.22 → 1670.54] I see a generation
[1670.54 → 1674.22] rising up to take their place
[1674.22 → 1677.22] with selfless faith,
[1677.22 → 1682.72] with selfless faith.
[1682.72 → 1692.38] I see a near revival, stirring as we pray and sing.
[1692.38 → 1699.34] We're on our knees, we're on our knees.
[1700.18 → 1709.74] Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest.
[1709.74 → 1722.58] Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest.
[1724.72 → 1729.70] Heal my heart and make it clean.
[1731.64 → 1736.40] Open up my eyes to the things unseen.
[1736.40 → 1745.40] Show me how to love like you have loved me.
[1746.30 → 1751.40] Break my heart for what breaks yours.
[1752.94 → 1757.40] Everything I am for your kingdom come.
[1757.40 → 1780.40] Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest.
[1780.40 → 1793.30] Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest.
[1793.30 → 1804.98] Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest.
[1804.98 → 1818.38] Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest.
[1818.38 → 1825.10] Hosanna in the highest.
[1825.10 → 1829.68] May be seated.
[1831.00 → 1849.78] Good morning.
[1849.78 → 1852.44] My name is Yap, and I'm a deacon here at Langley-Emmanuel.
[1853.30 → 1858.68] We continue our worship with the giving of our gifts to the budget and the special offering
[1858.68 → 1860.42] today is for the Gateway of Hope.
[1861.52 → 1864.94] The Gateway of Hope is a ministry of the Salvation Army in Canada.
[1865.28 → 1869.80] Serving the city and the township of Langley, their mission is to help the homeless and
[1869.80 → 1875.24] those at risk with material assistance and other crucial supports in order to help them
[1875.24 → 1876.42] find hope and move forward.
[1876.42 → 1881.62] Over the years since they've opened, they have assisted many men and women to move out
[1881.62 → 1884.38] of homelessness for good and into healthy living.
[1884.92 → 1887.78] Please consider giving to this ministry as you are able to.
[1889.46 → 1895.80] Proverbs 14, verse 31, whoever oppresses a poor man insults his maker, but he who is generous
[1895.80 → 1897.08] to the needy honours him.
[1898.16 → 1898.72] Thank you.
[1906.42 → 1934.50] This is my only comfort in my life and in my death.
[1934.50 → 1940.60] You are fully paid for all my sins and all my debt.
[1940.60 → 1950.80] Even when I struggle to believe, with your precious blood you set me free.
[1950.80 → 1962.80] I am not my own, but belong, body and soul.
[1962.80 → 1969.80] In my life and in death.
[1969.80 → 1976.80] To you, Lord, Christ my Lord.
[1976.80 → 1990.48] You preserve my life in such a way that without you, not a hair can fall from me unless you will it too.
[1990.48 → 2003.48] Even when I'm lost in desperation, all things work together for my salvation.
[2003.48 → 2017.48] I am not my own, but belong, body and soul.
[2017.48 → 2024.48] In my life and in death.
[2024.48 → 2032.48] To you, Lord, Christ my Lord.
[2032.48 → 2061.48] Always by your Holy Spirit you assure me of eternal life and make me willing and ready.
[2061.48 → 2066.48] Even when I can't see my way through.
[2066.48 → 2073.48] From now on to always live for you.
[2073.48 → 2078.48] To you, Lord, Christ my Lord.
[2078.48 → 2080.48] I am not my own, but belong, body and soul.
[2080.48 → 2086.48] I am not my own, but belong, body and soul.
[2086.48 → 2087.48] In my life and in death.
[2087.48 → 2088.48] In my life and in death.
[2088.48 → 2093.48] In my life and in death.
[2093.48 → 2099.48] To you, Lord, Christ my Lord.
[2099.48 → 2105.48] To you, Lord, Christ my Lord.
[2105.48 → 2120.48] I am not my own, but belong, body and soul.
[2120.48 → 2121.48] In my life and in death.
[2121.48 → 2122.48] In my life and in death.
[2122.48 → 2127.48] In my life and in death.
[2127.48 → 2137.48] To you, Lord, Christ my Lord.
[2137.48 → 2142.48] I am not my own, but belong, body and soul.
[2142.48 → 2147.48] I am not my own, but belong, body and soul.
[2147.48 → 2152.48] In my life and in death.
[2152.48 → 2153.48] In my life and in death.
[2153.48 → 2154.48] In my life and in death.
[2154.48 → 2155.48] In my life and in death.
[2155.48 → 2157.48] To you, Lord, Christ my Lord.
[2157.48 → 2169.48] To you, Lord, Christ my Lord.
[2169.48 → 2179.48] Good morning, everybody.
[2179.48 → 2184.48] If you haven't noticed already, because the weather is pretty warm,
[2184.48 → 2185.48] it's not summer anymore.
[2185.48 → 2188.48] This week was the first week of autumn or fall,
[2188.48 → 2191.48] which means that we're starting that transition at church
[2191.48 → 2193.48] to moving back into our ministry starting.
[2193.48 → 2197.48] So with that being said, I would like all the kids to come forward.
[2197.48 → 2201.48] So even if you're not in preschool, like we've been doing,
[2201.48 → 2206.48] but if you're in grade kindergarten or grade one or grade two or grade three
[2206.48 → 2210.48] or grade four, I know it's a little empty today with some of the families,
[2210.48 → 2213.48], but please come up and join me at the front.
[2213.48 → 2218.48] Oh, great. I see some big kids. I love it.
[2218.48 → 2224.48] We have to kind of practice doing this again because we've just had the youngest kids going to children's worship time.
[2224.48 → 2228.48] And it's a little bit of a trick because there is no children's worship time today.
[2228.48 → 2233.48] It's still just for the preschool and those who are in kindergarten this year.
[2233.48 → 2238.48] But next week we will be starting children's worship time again for all the kids.
[2238.48 → 2243.48] So we are looking forward to all the teachers being able to see you guys again and hearing about your summer
[2243.48 → 2246.48] and looking at God's word together.
[2246.48 → 2252.48] So what we're going to do is just say a quick little nice important prayer
[2252.48 → 2255.48] and then we'll do the blessing before some of you guys head off.
[2255.48 → 2261.48] Lord God, we thank you that we can come and sing and worship you at church
[2261.48 → 2264.48] and learn more about your word and your love for us.
[2264.48 → 2269.48] Thank you for the chance to listen to all these different grown-ups who can teach us.
[2269.48 → 2273.48] And we pray God that those who are going to children's worship time,
[2273.48 → 2276.48] that you would bless them as they learn in their classroom.
[2276.48 → 2278.48] In Jesus name, amen.
[2278.48 → 2280.48] All right, let's stand up.
[2280.48 → 2283.48] You guys don't know how to do it.
[2283.48 → 2284.48] Ready?
[2284.48 → 2288.48] The Lord is with you.
[2288.48 → 2291.48] And all will be with you.
[2291.48 → 2292.48] Amen.
[2308.48 → 2316.48] My name is John, and I'm one of the elders of the church here.
[2316.48 → 2319.48] And I'd like to lead you in our congregational prayer.
[2322.48 → 2324.48] Oh Lord God, we come before you.
[2324.48 → 2329.48] You are our great and awesome God, creator of this world.
[2329.48 → 2331.48] We see the beauty of your creation around us.
[2331.48 → 2336.48] As we see the transition into fall, we still see the sunshine and the warm weather today.
[2336.48 → 2338.48] We're thankful for that blessing.
[2338.48 → 2343.48] Thankful for the blessing of crops coming in, gardens being harvested.
[2343.48 → 2345.48] Lord, we see your hand in all these things.
[2346.48 → 2349.48] Lord, your love for us is truly beyond measure.
[2349.48 → 2351.48] And we are thankful for that.
[2351.48 → 2357.48] And Lord, we come as a congregation today to be able to give you the praise
[2357.48 → 2360.48] and the honour and the glory that is due your name.
[2360.48 → 2362.48] We humble ourselves before you.
[2362.48 → 2369.48] And we come as a broken people, those who are in need of salvation.
[2369.48 → 2375.48] Lord, we need your blessing on us as we live our lives according to your will.
[2375.48 → 2382.48] We need your comfort and your strength, Lord, for each day as we try to serve you.
[2382.48 → 2387.48] Lord, those of us who are grieving, those who are suffering the loss of loved ones,
[2387.48 → 2390.48] Lord, whether that was recent or long-term in the past,
[2390.48 → 2397.48] Lord, those hurts are still there, and we need your comfort, you're blessing on those who are hurting.
[2397.48 → 2406.48] Lord, that we as a family of believers may be able to support and bring comfort to those who are in need that way.
[2406.48 → 2423.48] Lord, we live in a broken world, and we see that, Lord, manifest in the weather that we have seen affecting the Maritimes, the Caribbean, even Bangladesh, Lord, with the floods and strong winds.
[2423.48 → 2434.48] Lord, many people are affected by that, and we pray for your blessing on those who have to regroup their lives, have to suffer through losses of homes and businesses.
[2434.48 → 2442.48] Lord, we pray that, as a church community, we may be able to support and help those who are in need.
[2442.48 → 2455.48] Lord, we also see brokenness in wars, and we see the difficulties that are happening in Ukraine with Russia trying to take control of other lands that are not theirs.
[2455.48 → 2458.48] We pray for peace in that situation there.
[2458.48 → 2468.48] Lord, we are as a church community starting in a new year of our new church year.
[2468.48 → 2476.48] We're thankful for the many blessings of people who are willing to give of their hearts and time and talents to serve in this community.
[2476.48 → 2486.48] Lord, that whether that's elders and deacons, whether that's Sunday school teachers, gems and cadet counsellors, others who are stepping forward to fill the gaps.
[2486.48 → 2506.48] Lord, we pray a blessing on those that your spirit may give strength and energy to those who are doing those tasks, that they may do that joyfully, be able to enjoy that time of fellowship and spreading your word to those who are in need.
[2506.48 → 2516.48] Lord, we pray also for the young adult ministry that is, we're looking for part-time position for working with our young adults in this church.
[2516.48 → 2525.48] We pray that people may come together next week to give a vote for whether we do this or not.
[2525.48 → 2533.48] Lord, we ask that we may be able to come to pass, that we may indeed have somebody to be able to work with our young adults in this church.
[2537.48 → 2541.48] Lord, we pray for preaching the word this morning.
[2541.48 → 2545.48] We're thankful for Kevin who will be bringing your word this morning.
[2545.48 → 2550.48] Lord, we pray for the Lord, that we may be able to ask a blessing on his words, that whatever he speaks may be your words, Lord.
[2550.48 → 2559.48] That those words may be able to go into our hearts and minds, that we may be able to take that to heart, that we may be able to live that in our coming week.
[2559.48 → 2566.48] Lord, we ask that we may earnestly seek you in everything that we do.
[2566.48 → 2580.48] Lord, we ask that your face may be shining on us, that your blessing may be in our hearts, in our minds, in our actions as we go out to serve you in this coming week.
[2580.48 → 2584.48] Lord, this we ask in your name alone. Amen.
[2589.48 → 2616.48] Thank you.
[2616.48 → 2624.88] If you've been joining us these past couple of weeks, you'll know that we've been working our
[2624.88 → 2631.24] way through a little sermon series called This Is Our Church. During this series, Pastor Chris
[2631.24 → 2637.92] has looked at our church's mission statement, gather, grow, go. Two weeks ago, Pastor Chris
[2637.92 → 2643.74] discussed why we gather, which was to be edified by each other as Christ works through us, especially
[2643.74 → 2650.22] in the areas of accountability and discipline, presence, and this new fun word called sacralizing.
[2650.90 → 2654.68] Last week, Pastor Chris led us through the second word of our mission statement called
[2654.68 → 2661.86] grow, which we learned that when we grow, sorry, because of Christ and to Christ and through Christ,
[2662.30 → 2667.08] as we serve our church and as we serve our communities around us. Today, we're going to
[2667.08 → 2673.74] be looking at that third word, go. Where do we go? Now, our Bible text this morning comes
[2673.74 → 2679.70] from Matthew 5, verses 38 to 48. It'll be on the screen behind me, but as always, I do encourage
[2679.70 → 2683.98] you, please, if you have your Bibles with you or your Bible apps on your phone, please open them up
[2683.98 → 2688.10] and have them accessible throughout the message because we're going to be going in and out of
[2688.10 → 2692.52] this text for the next little bit. So it's always good to have your Bibles at the ready. But here we
[2692.52 → 2696.68] go. Jesus says in Matthew 5, verse 38 to 48,
[2696.68 → 2704.96] You have heard that it was said, eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth. But I tell you, do not resist an
[2704.96 → 2711.48] evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also. And if
[2711.48 → 2718.36] anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well. If anyone forces you to go
[2718.36 → 2724.92] one mile, go with them two miles. Give to the one who asks you and do not turn away from the one who
[2724.92 → 2730.80] wants to borrow from you. You have heard that it was said, love your neighbour and hate your enemy.
[2730.90 → 2736.56] But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children
[2736.56 → 2743.76] of your Father in heaven. He causes his Son to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the
[2743.76 → 2749.30] righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are you,
[2749.52 → 2754.92] are not even the tax collectors doing that? And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing
[2754.92 → 2763.14] more than others? Do not even pagans do that? Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
[2764.14 → 2765.12] The Word of the Lord.
[2768.42 → 2773.74] So it was May 2020, and the whole world had shut down for about two and a half months,
[2773.76 → 2779.62] and on this week in May, I was preoccupied with a few different things. I was planning my next youth
[2779.62 → 2785.10] ministry night over Zoom and preparing a sermon that was going to be recorded in an empty room
[2785.10 → 2791.82] on my phone, held up by a music stand and supported by two Psalter hymnals in the back room 108 back
[2791.82 → 2797.98] there in a church that had been empty for 10 weeks. Most of my time back then was spent learning the
[2797.98 → 2803.60] intricacies of shooting videos on your phones or teaching people how to transfer files from their phone
[2803.60 → 2810.10] to the iCloud or organizing church devotions, devotions and services, sorry, for 300-ish people.
[2810.64 → 2815.88] I was busy writing stuff up for youth and figuring out how to engage 40 teenagers on a screen that's the
[2815.88 → 2820.62] size of a loaf of bread, when most of them honestly were coming with their cameras off because let's
[2820.62 → 2824.04] face it, we were all operating out of our pajamas back then and nobody wanted to be seen looking like
[2824.04 → 2832.52] that anyway. This was not my most favourite season of life, but this church was great. People were super
[2832.52 → 2837.98] patient as we did what we could. I got encouraging emails from members of this congregation for the
[2837.98 → 2842.84] church services that they watched and from youth and the parents of youth for the dumb games we were
[2842.84 → 2848.22] trying to do over Zoom and engage the youth in that way. Honestly, even though I hung out in this building
[2848.22 → 2853.46] by myself far more than I ever want to again, this church was very understanding. They were very patient,
[2853.82 → 2860.26] very encouraging. But that one week in May felt different. The context of the pandemic was sort of
[2860.26 → 2865.38] getting to me and after working so hard to bring some sort of semblance of community to people who we
[2865.38 → 2871.10] haven't been able to see in so long, I found myself at a tipping point then. The encouragement from
[2871.10 → 2876.44] the church, from you all, was very good. It was there. People were kind. They were gracious and understanding,
[2876.44 → 2883.06] but I was fading. But one evening at the end of that week in May when I was fading, there was a
[2883.06 → 2887.08] knock on my door and a member of this church, who will remain nameless because I didn't ask for
[2887.08 → 2892.86] permission to share this story, they were standing at my door with a big basket in hand. She told me
[2892.86 → 2897.86] that six couples in this church, all of them parents of youth, had gotten together and put this gift
[2897.86 → 2903.50] basket together to say thanks to Nikki and myself for those 10 weeks. There's a beautiful card inside
[2903.50 → 2908.32] full of encouragement, some delicious food, gift cards to different places. Now, I didn't deserve
[2908.32 → 2914.26] that. I didn't think. It wasn't something that these wonderful people had to do. But they went above
[2914.26 → 2919.04] and beyond. They went the extra mile and reached out to me and encouraged me in a moment that I really,
[2919.14 → 2923.32] really needed it. It changed my week. Actually, to be honest with you, it changed the next few months
[2923.32 → 2927.70] of that pandemic. It jolted me forward. It helped me persevere in the midst of these pandemic
[2927.70 → 2932.10] restrictions. And now, today, that we are on the other side of those intense restrictions,
[2932.10 → 2937.52] I still think of that gift as a huge blessing and a huge moment that really helped me persevere
[2937.52 → 2946.00] forward through that pandemic. And that's what this text is about, going above and beyond for everyone.
[2947.46 → 2952.60] The thrust of this text this morning teaches us not necessarily where to go, but how we are to go.
[2953.60 → 2956.42] So we're going to look at that for the next minute or, I don't know, 19.
[2956.42 → 2961.20] So Jesus starts off by quoting the Old Testament in his text. He says,
[2961.26 → 2965.26] you've heard it said, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. And he's right, of course. I'm not
[2965.26 → 2968.88] going to stand up here and say Jesus was wrong. Of course, he was right. An eye for an eye and a tooth
[2968.88 → 2973.72] for a tooth is in the Old Testament. It's actually in the Old Testament a bunch of times. Exodus 21,
[2973.82 → 2980.66] 24 says that. So does Leviticus 24, 20 and Deuteronomy 19, 21. The thing with all of those passages,
[2980.88 → 2985.92] though, is they're written to a specific audience. They're written to judges or to magistrates or to
[2985.92 → 2992.58] people who are in charge of doling out punishments in the court of law. See, the point of those passages
[2992.58 → 2999.00] is to inform those judges, those ruling over those conflicts, informing them on how to rule
[2999.00 → 3006.36] equitably, how to discern proper punishments for injustices. So those Old Testament passages are
[3006.36 → 3011.68] there basically saying, make sure to dole out those punishments equitably. Don't take a life for
[3011.68 → 3015.34] someone's eye. Don't take someone's limb because they knocked out someone's tooth.
[3015.92 → 3022.52] That's the context of those passages. Now the problem in Jesus' time was the Pharisees were
[3022.52 → 3026.54] getting a little overexcited with those laws, and they really started to lean into them a little bit.
[3026.70 → 3031.46] Rather than those laws be used just by the discerning courts as the Old Testament lays out,
[3031.66 → 3035.62] the Pharisees were becoming kind of overzealous. They were becoming a little bit like vigilantes,
[3035.80 → 3038.58] kind of like Batman but without the money or the detective skills or the eye makeup.
[3038.58 → 3044.94] So in one way Jesus is looking at these Pharisees, and he's trying to set the record straight here
[3044.94 → 3049.16] that this is not every Pharisee's job to dole out these punishments this way.
[3049.90 → 3055.70] But he does something so interesting here. He does something so interesting. He doesn't
[3055.70 → 3059.98] change the law. He changes the audience.
[3059.98 → 3065.66] See, he's still talking about eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, but now instead of addressing
[3065.66 → 3074.18] the judges on how to issue fair punishments, he's talking to those who were wronged and how
[3074.18 → 3079.78] they should respond. That's an important shift because he's talking about the same law here
[3079.78 → 3084.98] but to different people or to different side of those contexts. The lesson here is not that those
[3084.98 → 3089.40] who commit wrongdoings should get away with their crimes, that those in authority should simply
[3089.40 → 3095.36] turn their heads to the side and let people strike blows to people's faces or steal people's possessions
[3095.36 → 3102.44] or take advantage of people's time. This is a message of instruction to those who have been wronged
[3102.44 → 3109.20] and how to go about their lives in the midst of their troubles. This is a message about humility and
[3109.20 → 3114.28] selflessness. When we're wronged, we're not supposed to seek revenge.
[3114.28 → 3119.32] We're not supposed to seek reward. We are to seek peace and act righteously.
[3120.78 → 3123.86] Jesus uses three examples here, and we're going to look at each one quick.
[3124.72 → 3130.36] Jesus says when someone physically harms you or strikes you on the cheek, do not seek revenge by
[3130.36 → 3136.34] hitting them back. Don't repay violence with violence or injury with injury. Instead, turn the other
[3136.34 → 3143.02] cheek, Jesus says. Now, I think it's really important to pause here for a moment because I want to make
[3143.02 → 3148.70] sure I'm very clear. Some of you might be hearing this and might be in a position where you are being
[3148.70 → 3153.82] abused, or you are in a position where you are being bullied. Kids, if you're at school and getting
[3153.82 → 3159.10] bullied, this might be ringing some bells for you or if you're someone else getting physically taken
[3159.10 → 3165.98] advantage of you. I want to be very responsible here. Turning the other cheek does not mean remaining in a
[3165.98 → 3173.08] position where you are being abused by someone or bullied by someone. If someone is really hurting you,
[3173.66 → 3176.26] this is not saying simply take it on the cheek over and over again.
[3177.86 → 3182.36] If you're experiencing physical abuse or if you're being bullied or anything of that sort,
[3183.20 → 3190.82] it is important, it is vital for you to be safe. So please hear that. So if that's you, please don't think
[3190.82 → 3197.60] this is a message or a passage about you remaining in that abusive relationship. Instead, go to someone,
[3197.72 → 3202.36] go to an authority, be it the police, be it your teachers, be it a pastor or a mentor or a friend
[3202.36 → 3209.98] or a family member you trust and let them help. Your safety in that important is the most important
[3209.98 → 3217.50] thing. Turning the other cheek still means not responding in violence, but if you're in that position,
[3217.50 → 3223.08] you're still called to respond. Finding someone to help you is that response. Remember, that's why
[3223.08 → 3228.16] these laws in the Old Testament are there in the first place, to have systems in place so that judges
[3228.16 → 3234.36] and authorities can help keep people safe from perpetual violence, not just rendering that law of equitable
[3234.36 → 3240.18] punishment void. Jesus isn't doing that. He's teaching us how to respond when we get hurt. So what turning
[3240.18 → 3246.20] the other cheek means here is that in physical altercations, don't respond with violence.
[3247.50 → 3252.50] You don't lower the ceiling of holiness or righteousness and repay insult with insult.
[3253.64 → 3259.02] Instead, turn the other cheek. Respond with meekness. Respond to violence with peace.
[3259.50 → 3263.14] Turn the other cheek and walk away to someone who can help you.
[3263.14 → 3269.24] I really pray that that is clear today. So if it's not, please come speak to me after the service.
[3270.16 → 3275.52] So that's the first example Jesus uses. He's talking about physical harm, not responding to
[3275.52 → 3283.50] violence with violence. And the second example is about possession harm. When someone harms your
[3283.50 → 3290.04] stuff, your estate, or tries to steal your church, don't try to steal it back. Don't return selfishness
[3290.04 → 3294.96] with more selfishness. If matters are small, and honestly, I do think so many of the squabbles we
[3294.96 → 3300.14] find ourselves in are small. It says, cut your losses. Give of your stuff. Trust in God. Move on.
[3300.92 → 3306.52] We see these situations often when relationships break down or when family fights over inheritances or
[3306.52 → 3313.00] corrupt business deals in this sort of situations. Now, don't be a doormat, but respond to selfishness
[3313.00 → 3320.38] with selflessness. Let the petty stuff like your jacket go. People matter more than stuff. Jesus is
[3320.38 → 3327.84] saying, seek peace, not property. The third example Jesus gives here has to do with our time.
[3328.80 → 3334.18] If someone needs your time, don't just walk one mile with them. Walk two. This is where the saying,
[3334.26 → 3340.58] go the extra mile, comes from. Do more than what people ask of you. Give to the one who asks of you,
[3340.58 → 3344.76] and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you. That's what Jesus says.
[3345.42 → 3351.70] Be a willing servant. Help people who need your help. Don't just do the minimum. Go above and beyond.
[3352.44 → 3358.84] Give more to them than even they ask. Essentially, what Jesus is saying with all of these examples is
[3358.84 → 3365.84] we are to be meek. We are to be holy and righteous and selfless. Don't live in this world by the
[3365.84 → 3371.40] Western mantra of do no harm, but actually do more than that. That's a very low bar.
[3373.68 → 3379.64] Go above and beyond. Be charitable. Be generous with your time, with your money, with your stuff,
[3379.86 → 3386.78] with yourself. Because this message is more than do no harm. This message is done good for all people
[3386.78 → 3393.40] and do all the good you can. Again, it's not saying be a doormat or a pushover and don't remain in those
[3393.40 → 3402.26] toxic relationships, but don't simply just do no harm. Do good. Live righteously. Let the ultimate
[3402.26 → 3405.08] judge rule over your life as you live this way.
[3405.08 → 3414.02] Jesus doubles down on this message in the next chunk of text because he calls us to love our
[3414.02 → 3419.70] enemies. Now, I don't think Jesus pulls any punches here. He's very clear. Listen to what he says in
[3419.70 → 3425.62] verses 43 to 48, and I kind of summarize a little bit here. He says, I tell you, love your enemies and
[3425.62 → 3430.32] pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of the Father in heaven. If you love those
[3430.32 → 3435.72] who love you, what reward will you get? If you only greet your own people, what are you doing more
[3435.72 → 3441.12] than the others? Don't even the pagans do that? He's saying rather boldly, everyone loves those who
[3441.12 → 3448.16] are good to them. Everyone loves those who loves them back. If you're loving those who love you, great.
[3448.40 → 3454.48] Like, keep doing that. But also, kind of, who cares? That's not a very high bar again.
[3454.48 → 3462.08] Jesus is telling you, love your enemies. Pray for them. Pray for their well-being, their lives,
[3462.40 → 3467.24] the things that they are going through. That's the bar of holiness that Jesus is setting. That's the
[3467.24 → 3475.94] bar that we're to aim to here. So when we go, that's where it means. We are to go to our enemies,
[3476.36 → 3481.58] to live selflessly with those who we call enemies. Now, this isn't the only time Jesus calls for this.
[3481.58 → 3484.96] We actually did a whole sermon series in the summer, if you recall, on the parables.
[3485.52 → 3488.44] And one of the parables we talked about was the parable of the good Samaritan.
[3489.06 → 3493.84] Now, there's a lot in that parable, but one of the key points was that it was the Samaritan
[3493.84 → 3498.64] that saved this beaten man. It was the Samaritan who was the enemy
[3498.64 → 3507.14] who saved this man. The enemy was the neighbour. The enemy was the one who cared.
[3507.14 → 3513.10] That's who we are called to be, the one who cares for those who are our enemies.
[3515.08 → 3522.44] But it begs the question, doesn't it? Who are our enemies? As Christians, who are our enemies?
[3525.10 → 3529.40] Now, again, for some of you sitting today, you might have some very clear ideas about who your
[3529.40 → 3533.90] enemies are, and I am not here to minimize that. Maybe it's someone who has wronged you or treated you
[3533.90 → 3538.50] unfairly in the past. Maybe it's someone who's taken advantage of you or abused you. Some of you
[3538.50 → 3545.26] have real enemies. Enemies we need to turn the other cheek and remove ourselves from, as we discussed
[3545.26 → 3551.78] earlier. Enemies we need to find help so that we remain safe. And yet also, enemies that Jesus calls
[3551.78 → 3560.26] us to pray for, as hard as that may be. Some of you have lived through wars. Some of our older members
[3560.26 → 3565.42] here might remember World War II and have lived through the horrors of that day, of that season,
[3565.56 → 3572.56] sorry. Watching evil rain down on people. Real tangible enemies. We've helped refugee families
[3572.56 → 3578.28] in this church. Families who've lived through similar horrors. I mean, right now, there are stories of
[3578.28 → 3583.92] Christians around the world who have enemies persecuting you. They know who they are. A quick Google
[3583.92 → 3589.32] search found stories of Ukrainian Christians helping wounded Russian soldiers or Christians praying
[3589.32 → 3596.38] for peace in Myanmar among sort of the ongoing war happening there. Or Christians feeding those
[3596.38 → 3601.72] who persecute them in Nigeria. You can get stuck in an internet wormhole hearing these stories. We know
[3601.72 → 3609.70] they're happening. We hear it all the time. Christians serving their enemies when war rains down.
[3609.70 → 3619.88] But who are our enemies here? Like for many of us here today, we're pretty blessed. As Christians who
[3619.88 → 3624.46] have lived in Canada most of our lives, even for some of us lived in this Fraser Valley most of our
[3624.46 → 3631.10] lives, if not all of it. Who are our enemies? We don't really have any, do we?
[3631.10 → 3638.48] The thing is, we do. Because you see, what's happening in our culture, and this isn't just
[3638.48 → 3644.32] Christians, though we as Christians are as included in this group as anybody else, but in our culture, we
[3644.32 → 3650.94] create our enemies. We've been taught by the world around us a bunch of lies. We've been taught that if
[3650.94 → 3655.62] someone thinks differently than you, you must fear or hate them. Or if someone disagrees with you, you are
[3655.62 → 3661.66] intolerant, and then they must hate you. Or we're taught, if you don't submit to my views on social
[3661.66 → 3667.20] matters, or identity politics, or hot-button issues surrounding political affairs, or human rights, or
[3667.20 → 3674.88] pandemic restrictions, if I dare say, you must be my enemy. See, we're so polarized in our culture right now.
[3674.88 → 3679.12] If they don't think or act like we do, we isolate from them.
[3679.12 → 3687.76] If we disagree with a stance, we remove ourselves from the equation. Actually, we're told that if,
[3688.42 → 3694.84] we're not told, sorry, to remove ourselves from the equation, we are told to remove them from the equation.
[3696.12 → 3703.08] If internet message boards have taught us anything over the past five to ten years, we go on tirades over articles
[3703.08 → 3705.90] that we actually never read, or videos that we actually never watched.
[3705.90 → 3713.58] And instead of turning the cheek, we see headlines of issues that we disagree with, and outcomes the
[3713.58 → 3722.76] keyboard warrior in all of us. Before you disagree with me, I see it happen a lot, over and over again
[3722.76 → 3728.00] on Facebook mostly, but Instagram as well, with members of this church, and people I know beyond this
[3728.00 → 3735.32] church too, with issues that quite frankly, just don't need engaging online. And instead of turning that
[3735.32 → 3740.76] proverbial cheek, we lean into our screens, and we damage our keyboards or our phones because we're
[3740.76 → 3750.60] typing so hard. We just go at people. Because if we disagree, we've got to fight for our truths, for our
[3750.60 → 3760.04] views, for our beliefs. But you don't have to fight, especially online. We need to discuss, not fight. The
[3760.04 → 3765.08] problem is, not only do people engage these discussions poorly, without tact and without
[3765.08 → 3771.96] love, but we're also now starting to not engage these things at all. We're becoming so polarized as a
[3771.96 → 3781.40] culture that the algorithms that are used to feed you the information online are just pumping you stuff
[3781.40 → 3786.28] that you already agree with. Because that's what matters online, is your engagement. That's how the
[3786.28 → 3791.00] internet works. It gives you what you want to read. It's why when you start watching like a cooking video,
[3791.32 → 3795.66] or you watch like four of those in a row on Facebook or on Instagram, guess what's going to be in your
[3795.66 → 3801.96] feed the next three weeks? Cooking videos. The thing is, that's happening with the political articles you're
[3801.96 → 3807.24] reading, and it's happening with the pandemic news you're receiving the past few years. It's happening
[3807.24 → 3814.68] with everything. You're not getting both sides of the story. Just one very loud side that you already
[3814.68 → 3821.08] kind of agree with and lean towards. So confirmation bias, no matter what side of the argument you're on,
[3821.08 → 3826.28] wins out. And echo chambers start ringing very loudly, and that creates a massive problem, because
[3826.28 → 3834.92] the other side of the argument has now become your enemy. We're so polarized already as a culture,
[3834.92 → 3840.52] and we're creating false enemies that, and we don't even know because we don't ever really
[3840.52 → 3849.48] meaningfully listen to the other side. Craig Turnbull, in an article titled The Anti-Fragile
[3849.48 → 3855.76] Christian, speaks to this truth when he's discussing how we have become a culture that creates
[3855.76 → 3857.88] our own enemies. He says this, he says,
[3857.88 → 3866.12] Intolerant of differences, words are viewed as violence, debates as toxic, and disagreements
[3866.12 → 3872.92] as assaults on self-sovereignty. The concept of trauma is bloated to now include anything that's
[3872.92 → 3878.60] done against individual truths. And the obsession with eliminating threats, both real and perceived,
[3879.16 → 3882.60] celebrates the title of victim whenever it is convenient to do so.
[3882.60 → 3889.48] Now again, just stepping away from this for a second, there are real victims out there. There is
[3889.48 → 3895.88] real trauma out there. Some of you have experienced both or are experiencing both, and to you, we want
[3895.88 → 3900.60] to help you. Please understand that we know that there are real people hurting, real victims out there,
[3900.60 → 3902.84] and real trauma that exists. And yet,
[3902.84 → 3913.32] those real situations are minimized by exactly what Craig is saying here. That we are celebrating
[3913.32 → 3919.32] victimhood to the point that we are creating enemies out of good, well-meaning people who might just think
[3919.32 → 3925.80] differently than you. We don't actually have enemies, but we create them every day because our world is
[3925.80 → 3932.68] divided on everything. And one last thing, if you're sitting here today thinking, oh man, I really hope
[3932.68 → 3937.32] the left-wingers are hearing this, or I really hope the right-wingers are, or I hope the pro-choice
[3937.32 → 3943.40] people are tuned in, or the pro-life folks are, or the anti-this or the alt-that or the other side of
[3943.40 → 3948.52] the argument is listening very clearly, you are emphatically proving my point.
[3948.52 → 3957.56] If you are thinking the other side right now, wishing them to understand this, you are guilty of
[3957.56 → 3965.00] victimizing yourself right at this moment and making an enemy of the other side. Because that is how
[3965.00 → 3972.60] polarization works. You see, the majority of us don't really have enemies. But we live in a culture that
[3972.60 → 3977.08] sure likes to create them for us. And we are guilty of following that culture.
[3981.88 → 3988.76] And so those enemies, or more accurately, to those people who might think or act differently than you,
[3988.76 → 3999.08] or have different opinions than you, Jesus gives this command. Love them and pray for them. But don't
[3999.08 → 4008.04] just love them. Go above and beyond for them. Walk the extra mile for them, or with them. Give them
[4008.04 → 4015.64] your coat. Serve them. Be with them. Don't fight back. Whether you're online reading some dumb Facebook
[4015.64 → 4023.16] article or stepping into an actual physical altercation, don't fight back. Be the bringer of peace.
[4023.16 → 4031.56] Please engage the conversation with love. Jesus is our example here. He led in this way. Jesus not only
[4031.56 → 4039.64] led in this way, he lived this way. And he died this way. Read 1 Peter with me. 1 Peter 2, 21 to 24,
[4039.64 → 4046.76] it says this, To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example that you
[4046.76 → 4053.00] should follow in his steps. He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth. When they hurled
[4053.00 → 4060.52] their insults at him, he did not retaliate. When he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted
[4060.52 → 4069.56] himself to him who judges justly. He himself bore our sins in his body on the cross so that we might die to
[4069.56 → 4080.44] sin and live for righteousness. He hurled no insults. Furthermore, he made no threats. Furthermore, he died for the love of all he
[4080.44 → 4089.24] created so that we might live for righteousness. That's the gospel message. Jesus came to this earth.
[4089.24 → 4094.60] He lived a perfect life that we could not live, and he died the death that we all deserve to die,
[4094.60 → 4100.52] and he did that in our place. Three days later, he rose again from the grave and defeated sin
[4100.52 → 4108.12] and death in order that we may live for righteousness. That is our goal, to go and live for righteousness.
[4110.04 → 4117.24] When we say gather, grow, go, we don't just mean go out. We don't just mean go into the neighbourhood,
[4117.24 → 4122.84] or go into your communities or your work. This message is not just simply go to a place.
[4122.84 → 4132.76] Go is a posture. When we go, we go to our neighbours, the friends and the enemies, those who think like us,
[4132.76 → 4140.04] those who think unlike us, who we disagree with. When we go, we go to bring peace, not engage in vitriol
[4140.04 → 4147.96] conversations and add to the polarization of this world. When we go, we go above and beyond for the
[4147.96 → 4155.64] people God has placed in our lives. We give more of ourselves, more of our stuff, more of our money,
[4155.64 → 4165.32] more of our time, more of us. Because when we go, we go in the name of Jesus Christ, who never wavered in
[4165.32 → 4171.24] his mission to love those and serve those around him. He didn't hurl insults back. He never threatened
[4171.24 → 4177.72] those who beat him or who humiliated him. In fact, he went as far as any person could go.
[4178.84 → 4186.28] He went right to death. For not just those who loved him, but to those who were his enemies as well.
[4188.52 → 4193.96] That's why we go, and that's how we go, because it is Jesus who we follow. So as we go,
[4193.96 → 4201.80] let's remember that going isn't just a place. We're called to go with a posture. Jesus is led by not
[4201.80 → 4207.80] being vengeful, and so we are called to do the same, living selfless lives of love for all people
[4207.80 → 4214.92] and going above and beyond for them. As we go, let us remember that Jesus came and endured the cross
[4214.92 → 4224.12] for us all, for you, for me. Now we must go above and beyond for him. Amen? Let me pray.
[4228.84 → 4233.88] Our great God in heaven, we come to you today after reading this text,
[4236.36 → 4239.08] understanding a little bit more of what you call us to do.
[4239.08 → 4246.60] Lord, we live in a world where it becomes easy, even accidental, to create enemies out of people
[4246.60 → 4252.60] who disagree with us, who think differently than us. God, let us not get sucked into that trap.
[4255.16 → 4261.96] Lord, you have created all, and you have called us to not simply love those who love us, but love
[4261.96 → 4268.84] our enemies. God, may we do that well. God, may we do that with discernment. If we're in
[4268.84 → 4273.16] places we need to escape, let us escape, but let us pray for those who persecute us.
[4276.20 → 4283.64] And so God, today, as we leave this building in a little while, and we go into the world that you
[4283.64 → 4291.56] have made for us, the communities that you have given us, God, may we go in your name. May we go
[4291.56 → 4297.56] above and beyond, and may we go serving you and loving your people in your name. Amen.
[4298.84 → 4306.20] Let's stand and sing together.
[4306.20 → 4336.18] Let's stand and sing together.
[4336.18 → 4354.18] Let me be my servant. Let me be as Christ to you. Pray that I may have the grace to let you be my servant too.
[4354.18 → 4356.18] Let me be as Christ to you.
[4356.18 → 4372.98] We are pilgrims on a journey. We are travellers on the road. We are here to help each other,
[4372.98 → 4379.86] walk the mile and bear the load.
[4379.86 → 4381.86] I will hold the grace to you.
[4381.86 → 4385.86] I will hold the grace to you.
[4385.86 → 4391.86] In the nighttime of your fear.
[4391.86 → 4397.86] I will hold my hand out to you.
[4397.86 → 4403.86] Speak the peace you long to hear.
[4403.86 → 4417.86] I will weep when you are weeping. When you laugh, I'll laugh with you.
[4417.86 → 4431.86] I will share your joy and sorrow. Till we've seen this journey through.
[4431.86 → 4443.86] While you let me be your servant. Let me be as Christ to you.
[4443.86 → 4457.86] Pray that I may have the grace to let you be my servant too.
[4457.86 → 4459.86] Amen.
[4459.86 → 4461.86] Amen.
[4461.86 → 4463.86] Amen.
[4463.86 → 4464.86] Amen.
[4464.86 → 4466.86] Amen.
[4466.86 → 4468.86] Amen.
[4468.86 → 4470.86] Amen.
[4470.86 → 4472.86] Amen.
[4472.86 → 4474.86] Amen.
[4494.86 → 4498.86] Amen.
[4498.86 → 4502.86] Amen.
[4502.86 → 4510.86] Amen.
[4510.86 → 4516.86] Amen.
[4516.86 → 4522.86] Amen.
[4522.86 → 4543.00] These are the days of Elijah, declaring the word of the Lord.
[4543.00 → 4552.04] And these are the days of your servant Moses, righteousness being restored.
[4552.86 → 4562.82] And though these are days of great trials, of famine and darkness and sorrow,
[4563.18 → 4571.42] still we are the voice in the desert, crying, prepare ye the way of the Lord.
[4571.42 → 4579.56] Behold, He comes, rising like a child, shining like a sun,
[4579.56 → 4591.84] at the trumpet-call, lift your voice, hear of jubilee, and out of sight till salvation comes.
[4591.84 → 4605.32] And these are the days of Ezekiel, the dry bones becoming as flesh.
[4605.32 → 4615.28] And these are the days of your servant David, rebuilding a temple of praise.
[4615.28 → 4620.56] And these are the days of the harvest.
[4620.56 → 4625.72] The fields are as white in the world.
[4625.72 → 4634.58] And we are your labours in your vineyard, declaring the word of the Lord.
[4635.00 → 4644.72] Behold, He comes, riding on the clouds, shining like a sun, as the trumpet-call.
[4644.72 → 4654.72] Lift your voice, hear of jubilee, and out of sight till salvation comes.
[4654.72 → 4669.52] There's no God like Jehovah.
[4669.52 → 4684.72] believe salvation come there's no god like Jehovah there's no god like Jehovah there's no god like
