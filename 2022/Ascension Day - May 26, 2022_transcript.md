[964.62 --> 975.08]  In John 14
[975.08 --> 976.40]  Jesus says
[976.40 --> 978.64]  Do not let your hearts
[978.64 --> 979.88]  Be troubled
[979.88 --> 982.14]  You believed in God
[982.14 --> 984.00]  Believe also in me
[984.00 --> 985.78]  My father's house
[985.78 --> 987.34]  Has many rooms
[987.34 --> 989.46]  If that were not so
[989.46 --> 991.44]  I would have told you
[991.44 --> 992.86]  Or would I have told you
[992.86 --> 994.04]  That I am going there
[994.04 --> 995.48]  To prepare a place for you
[995.48 --> 997.30]  And if I go
[997.30 --> 999.12]  To prepare a place for you
[999.12 --> 1000.24]  I will come back
[1000.24 --> 1001.18]  And take you
[1001.18 --> 1002.04]  To be with me
[1002.04 --> 1003.24]  That you may be
[1003.24 --> 1005.10]  Where I am also
[1005.10 --> 1007.68]  You know the way
[1007.68 --> 1008.28]  To the place
[1008.28 --> 1009.08]  Where I am going
[1009.08 --> 1011.08]  Thomas said to him
[1011.08 --> 1012.38]  Lord we don't know
[1012.38 --> 1013.10]  Where you're going
[1013.10 --> 1014.68]  So how can we know the way
[1014.68 --> 1018.06]  In a world
[1018.06 --> 1019.42]  Where it can be
[1019.42 --> 1020.50]  So hard
[1020.50 --> 1022.58]  To see Jesus
[1022.58 --> 1024.66]  And so hard
[1024.66 --> 1025.30]  To believe
[1025.30 --> 1026.48]  That he is
[1026.48 --> 1027.64]  Still at work
[1027.64 --> 1029.24]  We can be like
[1029.24 --> 1029.92]  The disciples
[1029.92 --> 1031.72]  Like Thomas
[1031.72 --> 1032.90]  Who questioned
[1032.90 --> 1034.26]  And doubted
[1034.26 --> 1037.10]  But let's remember
[1037.10 --> 1038.68]  The end of that chapter
[1038.68 --> 1040.36]  Where Jesus
[1040.36 --> 1041.64]  Says to them
[1041.64 --> 1044.18]  All this I have spoken
[1044.18 --> 1045.44]  While still with you
[1045.44 --> 1047.06]  But the advocate
[1047.06 --> 1048.12]  The Holy Spirit
[1048.12 --> 1048.82]  Whom the Father
[1048.82 --> 1050.16]  Will send in my name
[1050.16 --> 1051.00]  Will teach you
[1051.00 --> 1052.04]  All things
[1052.04 --> 1053.14]  And will remind you
[1053.14 --> 1054.00]  Of everything
[1054.00 --> 1055.20]  I have said to you
[1055.20 --> 1058.08]  Peace I leave with you
[1058.08 --> 1060.66]  My peace I give you
[1060.66 --> 1061.74]  I do not give
[1061.74 --> 1062.88]  As the world gives
[1062.88 --> 1064.30]  Do not let your hearts
[1064.30 --> 1064.88]  Be troubled
[1064.88 --> 1067.00]  And do not be afraid
[1067.00 --> 1069.84]  You have heard me say
[1069.84 --> 1070.98]  I am going away
[1070.98 --> 1072.20]  And coming back to you
[1072.20 --> 1073.74]  If you loved me
[1073.74 --> 1074.72]  You would be glad
[1074.72 --> 1076.08]  That I am going to the Father
[1076.08 --> 1076.74]  For the Father
[1076.74 --> 1078.00]  Is greater than I
[1078.00 --> 1080.24]  And I have told you
[1080.24 --> 1081.90]  Now before it happens
[1081.90 --> 1084.38]  So that when it does happen
[1084.38 --> 1086.54]  You will believe
[1086.54 --> 1089.60]  Prayer of faith
[1089.60 --> 1091.66]  On ascension day
[1091.66 --> 1093.48]  And the prayer of faith
[1093.48 --> 1094.24]  Every day
[1094.24 --> 1095.92]  Says I believe
[1095.92 --> 1098.22]  Help my unbelief
[1098.22 --> 1100.62]  The prayer of faith
[1100.62 --> 1101.76]  Says again
[1101.76 --> 1102.98]  With Thomas
[1102.98 --> 1104.04]  My Lord
[1104.04 --> 1106.02]  And my God
[1106.02 --> 1132.54]  Create in me
[1132.54 --> 1136.04]  A clean heart
[1136.04 --> 1138.12]  Oh God
[1138.12 --> 1142.28]  And renew a right spirit
[1142.28 --> 1145.12]  Within me
[1145.12 --> 1149.70]  Create in me
[1149.70 --> 1153.12]  A clean heart
[1153.12 --> 1155.32]  Oh God
[1155.32 --> 1159.38]  And renew a right spirit
[1159.38 --> 1161.38]  Within me
[1161.38 --> 1167.38]  Cast me not away
[1167.38 --> 1170.38]  From thy presence
[1170.38 --> 1172.38]  Oh Lord
[1172.38 --> 1177.40]  Take not thine Holy Spirit
[1177.40 --> 1179.38]  From me
[1179.38 --> 1185.38]  Restore unto me
[1185.38 --> 1189.38]  The joy of thy salvation
[1189.38 --> 1193.38]  And renew a right spirit
[1193.90 --> 1196.38]  Within me
[1196.38 --> 1198.38]  Let's pray
[1198.38 --> 1200.56]  Holy Lord
[1200.56 --> 1203.36]  We live in a world
[1203.36 --> 1204.38]  Where seeing
[1204.38 --> 1206.36]  Seems to be believing
[1206.36 --> 1208.58]  And so many times
[1208.58 --> 1209.82]  What we see is altered
[1209.82 --> 1211.50]  In a way to make us think
[1211.50 --> 1212.30]  Something is true
[1212.30 --> 1212.92]  When it's not
[1212.92 --> 1216.16]  It gets to the point
[1216.16 --> 1217.98]  Where we
[1217.98 --> 1218.76]  If we have not
[1218.76 --> 1219.88]  Seen something ourselves
[1219.88 --> 1221.48]  We have doubts
[1221.48 --> 1222.32]  Whether they happen
[1222.32 --> 1224.82]  One truth
[1224.82 --> 1226.62]  Has stood the test
[1226.62 --> 1227.08]  Of time
[1227.08 --> 1228.34]  Your word
[1228.34 --> 1229.70]  Your revelation
[1229.70 --> 1231.80]  Through the centuries
[1231.80 --> 1232.38]  Of faith
[1232.38 --> 1233.70]  Of those before us
[1233.70 --> 1235.52]  They have told us
[1235.52 --> 1236.60]  Of our wondrous creator
[1236.60 --> 1237.78]  And redeeming savior
[1237.78 --> 1239.54]  Sanctifying spirit
[1239.54 --> 1241.16]  We fail
[1241.16 --> 1241.80]  And we falter
[1241.80 --> 1243.20]  But we know
[1243.20 --> 1243.94]  That we have hope
[1243.94 --> 1244.24]  In you
[1244.24 --> 1246.52]  And even now
[1246.52 --> 1248.06]  Though we don't see it
[1248.06 --> 1249.46]  Jesus
[1249.46 --> 1250.62]  The ascended savior
[1250.62 --> 1252.18]  Stands before your throne
[1252.18 --> 1254.18]  Interceding for us
[1254.18 --> 1255.86]  Facing the accuser
[1255.86 --> 1257.98]  We are thankful
[1257.98 --> 1258.48]  To know
[1258.48 --> 1259.28]  That no matter
[1259.28 --> 1260.04]  Our shortcomings
[1260.04 --> 1261.56]  We are loved
[1261.56 --> 1263.20]  And we are forgiven
[1263.20 --> 1265.14]  And with that faith
[1265.14 --> 1265.82]  And that knowledge
[1265.82 --> 1267.40]  We strive to change ourselves
[1267.40 --> 1268.80]  To live
[1268.80 --> 1270.14]  To further your kingdom
[1270.14 --> 1271.26]  Amen
[1271.26 --> 1282.36]  Create in me
[1282.36 --> 1285.92]  A clean heart
[1285.92 --> 1287.70]  Oh God
[1287.70 --> 1292.24]  And renew a right spirit
[1292.24 --> 1294.70]  Within me
[1294.70 --> 1309.46]  And renew a right spirit
[1309.46 --> 1312.52]  Within me
[1312.52 --> 1317.80]  Cast me not away
[1317.80 --> 1320.32]  From thy presence
[1320.32 --> 1322.76]  O Lord
[1322.76 --> 1327.52]  And take not thy holy spirit
[1327.52 --> 1328.04]  From me
[1328.04 --> 1334.98]  Restore unto me
[1334.98 --> 1339.80]  The joy of thy salvation
[1339.80 --> 1344.30]  And renew a right spirit
[1344.30 --> 1346.98]  Within me
[1346.98 --> 1350.90]  We are going to respond
[1350.90 --> 1351.76]  With a new song
[1351.76 --> 1352.88]  Called Behold the Lamb
[1352.88 --> 1354.38]  If you know it already
[1354.38 --> 1354.72]  Great
[1354.72 --> 1355.94]  You can sing along
[1355.94 --> 1357.80]  But also learn it
[1357.80 --> 1358.82]  Along with us
[1358.82 --> 1359.28]  As we sing
[1359.28 --> 1382.06]  And let's eve
[1382.06 --> 1382.38]  Praise His whole Commerce

[1422.84 --> 1436.84]  you bore our shame and paid the cost oh god we thank you for the cross
[1438.84 --> 1452.84]  the story of redemption written on his hands jesus you will reign forever
[1452.84 --> 1463.84]  is
[1463.84 --> 1473.62]  In this hallelujah to your holy name, Jesus, you will reign forevermore.
[1473.62 --> 1478.34]  The victory is yours.
[1478.34 --> 1493.08]  Father, His sacrifice for every sin, our Savior died.
[1493.08 --> 1499.24]  The Lord of our reign can't be contained.
[1500.36 --> 1505.02]  Our God has risen from the grave.
[1505.02 --> 1512.80]  Oh, our God has risen from the grave.
[1512.80 --> 1522.30]  Behold the Lamb, the story of redemption written on His hands.
[1522.98 --> 1526.80]  Jesus, you will reign forevermore.
[1527.32 --> 1530.80]  The victory is yours.
[1530.80 --> 1534.88]  We sing your praise.
[1535.50 --> 1540.82]  Endless hallelujahs to your holy name.
[1541.58 --> 1544.80]  Jesus, you will reign forevermore.
[1545.86 --> 1548.80]  The victory is yours.
[1548.80 --> 1564.62]  When the age of death is done, we'll see your face bright as the sun.
[1564.62 --> 1571.58]  We'll bow before the King of kings.
[1571.58 --> 1577.40]  Oh, God, forever we will see.
[1577.40 --> 1590.96]  Behold the Lamb, the story of redemption written on His hands.
[1590.96 --> 1594.96]  Jesus, you will reign forevermore.
[1594.96 --> 1599.74]  The victory is yours.
[1599.74 --> 1602.74]  We sing your praise.
[1602.74 --> 1603.26]  We sing your praise.
[1603.26 --> 1609.04]  Endless hallelujahs to your holy name.
[1609.04 --> 1613.52]  Jesus, you will reign forevermore.
[1613.52 --> 1616.76]  The victory is yours.
[1616.76 --> 1619.66]  You reign forevermore.
[1619.66 --> 1622.68]  The victory is yours.
[1622.68 --> 1625.74]  You reign forevermore.
[1625.74 --> 1630.12]  The victory is yours.
[1641.44 --> 1644.94]  Ephesians chapter 1, verses 18 to 23.
[1644.94 --> 1653.58]  I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which He has called you,
[1654.14 --> 1657.48]  the riches of His glorious inheritance in His holy people,
[1658.08 --> 1661.56]  and His incomparably great power for us who believe.
[1662.32 --> 1667.92]  That power is the same as the mighty strength He exerted when He raised Christ from the dead
[1667.92 --> 1676.66]  and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly realms, far above all rule and authority, power and dominion,
[1676.66 --> 1683.66]  and every name that is invoked, not only in the present age, but also in the one to come.
[1683.66 --> 1691.50]  And God placed all things under His feet and appointed Him to be head over everything for the church,
[1691.50 --> 1698.20]  which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills everything in every way.
[1698.20 --> 1720.40]  feel me
[1720.40 --> 1730.28]  Before the throne of God above, I am a strong and perfect glee,
[1730.28 --> 1739.28]  a great high priest whose name is the whoever lives and pleads for me.
[1740.22 --> 1749.28]  My name is graven on his hands, my name is written on his heart.
[1749.28 --> 1758.52]  I know that while in heaven he stands, no tongue can bid me, let's depart.
[1758.92 --> 1763.32]  No tongue can bid me, let's depart.
[1766.14 --> 1775.26]  When slaves intends me to despair, and tells me of the guilt within,
[1775.26 --> 1785.18]  upward I look and see him there, who made an end of all my sin.
[1785.58 --> 1794.26]  Because the sinless Savior died, my sinful soul is counted free.
[1794.26 --> 1804.58]  For God the just is satisfied, to look on him and pardon me.
[1804.58 --> 1809.58]  To look on him and pardon me.
[1811.58 --> 1821.70]  Behold him there, the risen Lamb, my perfect spotless righteousness.
[1821.70 --> 1832.54]  The great unchangeable I am, the King of glory and of grace.
[1832.54 --> 1842.72]  One with himself I cannot die, my soul is purchased by his blood.
[1842.72 --> 1847.72]  My life is hid with Christ on high.
[1847.72 --> 1848.72]  My life is hid with Christ on high.
[1848.72 --> 1852.72]  With Christ my Savior and my God.
[1852.72 --> 1857.72]  With Christ my Savior and my God.
[1857.72 --> 1876.72]  With Christ my Savior and my God.
[1876.72 --> 1889.72]  With Christ my Savior and my God.
[1889.72 --> 1891.72]  Go ahead and have a seat.
[1891.72 --> 1905.72]  It is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority.
[1905.72 --> 1910.26]  But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you,
[1910.38 --> 1915.44]  and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria,
[1915.90 --> 1917.44]  and to the ends of the earth.
[1917.44 --> 1924.44]  After he said this, he was taken up before their very eyes,
[1924.44 --> 1927.44]  and a cloud hid him from their sight.
[1930.44 --> 1932.44]  A hiding cloud.
[1932.44 --> 1936.44]  I still can't see him.
[1936.44 --> 1940.44]  Why would he leave when the world still needs him?
[1940.44 --> 1945.44]  Up he rose, his saints to raise, sent to the world to proclaim his praise,
[1945.44 --> 1948.44]  but all the world's a stage in the shape of a maze,
[1948.44 --> 1952.44]  and I'm trapped in a cage, stuck on an empty phrase.
[1952.44 --> 1958.44]  Why would he leave when the world still needs him?
[1958.44 --> 1962.44]  Why would he leave when I still need him?
[1962.44 --> 1968.44]  When they saw him, they worshiped him.
[1968.44 --> 1971.44]  But some doubted.
[1971.44 --> 1976.44]  Even the disciples doubted, and so I'm with them.
[1976.44 --> 1980.44]  In this world you will have trouble, but all I see is mayhem.
[1980.44 --> 1984.44]  You question me, I question God.
[1984.44 --> 1987.44]  I can be faithless and feel like a fraud,
[1987.44 --> 1990.44]  looking up to the sky, wanting to see him.
[1990.44 --> 1992.44]  There's something I must know.
[1992.44 --> 1993.44]  Hands held high, I cry.
[1993.44 --> 1998.44]  How long, O Lord, where did you go?
[1998.44 --> 2005.44]  They were looking intently up into the sky as he was going.
[2007.44 --> 2011.44]  Looking intently up into the sky, feelings in tension.
[2011.44 --> 2014.44]  I want to know why, but I fear what he'll mention.
[2014.44 --> 2018.44]  I'm content to look up so as to not contend with what's below.
[2018.44 --> 2024.44]  The surface is shaking, but this, this is all I know.
[2024.44 --> 2031.44]  Lord, are you at this time going to restore your creation?
[2031.44 --> 2035.44]  I'm left in these depths crying for salvation.
[2035.44 --> 2038.44]  Why did you leave and where did you go?
[2038.44 --> 2041.44]  Why did you leave and where did you go?
[2041.44 --> 2043.44]  Why did you leave?
[2043.44 --> 2047.44]  And where did you go?
[2047.44 --> 2064.44]  I have told you now,
[2064.44 --> 2068.44]  before it happens,
[2068.44 --> 2073.44]  so that when it happens, you will believe.
[2073.44 --> 2078.44]  I have gone so that you may come.
[2078.44 --> 2081.44]  I have come so that you may go.
[2081.44 --> 2087.44]  Never, not once did I not know where you are and where you will go.
[2087.44 --> 2089.44]  Here I sit at the right hand of the Father,
[2089.44 --> 2093.44]  my righteous hand to carry you farther than you could ever go.
[2093.44 --> 2094.44]  On your own.
[2094.44 --> 2098.44]  I can never leave you alone.
[2098.44 --> 2103.44]  Always and forever, this you will learn.
[2103.44 --> 2107.44]  Exchanged a crown of thorns for the crown of a sovereign.
[2107.44 --> 2112.44]  King of kings above all things, right to reign and reigning right.
[2112.44 --> 2116.44]  Just us now through your dark night.
[2116.44 --> 2119.44]  My spirit I give like I gave my life,
[2119.44 --> 2121.44]  poured out for the many, risen to reign.
[2121.44 --> 2124.44]  The lion of Judah and the lamb who was slain.
[2124.44 --> 2129.44]  My body in heaven as a promise that you will be my face before the throne
[2129.44 --> 2133.44]  so that your plea can be constant intercessor.
[2133.44 --> 2137.44]  I hear your shouting.
[2137.44 --> 2143.44]  And I whisper my affections through your doubting.
[2143.44 --> 2149.44]  As you have seen me go, I will return.
[2149.44 --> 2155.44]  All tears will end and you will learn what great love the Father has lavished on you,
[2155.44 --> 2162.44]  known in this moment precisely because I withdrew.
[2162.44 --> 2171.44]  But never, not once, did I ever leave you.
[2171.44 --> 2176.44]  All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
[2176.44 --> 2179.44]  Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations,
[2179.44 --> 2181.44]  baptizing them in the name of the Father,
[2181.44 --> 2185.44]  and the name of the Son, and the name of the Holy Spirit,
[2185.44 --> 2190.44]  and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.
[2190.44 --> 2198.44]  And surely, I am with you always, to the very end of the age.
[2206.44 --> 2228.44]  I am with you always, to the very end of the earth.
[2228.44 --> 2238.44]  The salvation belongs to our God, who sits upon the throne.
[2240.92 --> 2255.44]  And unto the Lamb, praise and glory, wisdom and grace, honor and power and strength.
[2255.44 --> 2262.82]  Be to our God forever and ever.
[2262.82 --> 2268.72]  Be to our God forever and ever.
[2268.96 --> 2275.78]  Be to our God forever and ever. Amen.
[2275.78 --> 2291.70]  And we the redeemed shall be strong in purpose and unity.
[2291.70 --> 2309.70]  Declaring the Lamb, praise and glory, wisdom and grace, honor and power and strength.
[2309.70 --> 2316.28]  Be to our God forever and ever.
[2317.08 --> 2322.36]  Be to our God forever and ever.
[2322.76 --> 2329.40]  Be to our God forever and ever. Amen.
[2329.40 --> 2343.78]  Be to our God forever and ever.
[2343.78 --> 2346.16]  Forever and ever.
[2346.16 --> 2354.16]  Be to our God forever and ever. Amen.
[2358.16 --> 2364.66]  Be to our God forever and ever.
[2364.66 --> 2377.92]  Be to our God forever and ever. Amen.
[2377.92 --> 2387.94]  From Acts chapter 1.
[2389.04 --> 2391.50]  They gathered around him and asked him,
[2392.04 --> 2396.00]  Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?
[2396.50 --> 2397.70]  He said to them,
[2397.70 --> 2403.40]  It is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority.
[2404.00 --> 2407.94]  But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you.
[2408.34 --> 2414.86]  And you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the ends of the earth.
[2415.94 --> 2423.48]  And after he said this, he was taken up before their very eyes and a cloud hid him from their sight.
[2423.48 --> 2432.18]  They were looking intently up into the sky as he was going when suddenly two men dressed in white stood before them.
[2433.00 --> 2434.48]  Men of Galilee, they said,
[2434.68 --> 2437.56]  Why do you stand here looking up into the sky?
[2438.30 --> 2446.68]  This same Jesus who has been taken from you into heaven will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven.
[2452.28 --> 2453.32]  Will you pray with me?
[2453.48 --> 2463.30]  Lord our God, we come before you in prayer on this Ascension Day.
[2464.88 --> 2471.20]  An act of faith, in part made possible by the Ascension.
[2471.20 --> 2485.60]  We can pray with confidence because we know that your spirit takes these words and carries them up to your throne and that Jesus himself, our constant intercessor,
[2486.60 --> 2489.80]  our heavenly mediator,
[2491.10 --> 2493.22]  hears them, perfects them,
[2494.78 --> 2496.08]  speaks them to your ear.
[2496.08 --> 2502.08]  And by the full work of the triune God in prayer,
[2502.08 --> 2507.62]  you use the prayer of your saints to act in this world.
[2507.62 --> 2517.26]  And so, Lord God, we pray with confidence even when we doubt.
[2517.26 --> 2523.66]  We pray with boldness even when we are afraid.
[2525.26 --> 2533.74]  We pray with urgency and conviction even when we cannot see you.
[2533.74 --> 2544.28]  Because we know that our prayer and your hearing and acting in response is not based on us,
[2544.56 --> 2549.24]  but based on Jesus Christ, our ascended King.
[2549.24 --> 2557.50]  And so, in the confidence of our King, we praise your name, Lord Jesus.
[2558.24 --> 2564.50]  In the confidence of our King, we boast in the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[2564.64 --> 2567.92]  In the confidence of our King, we pray,
[2567.92 --> 2570.16]  come quickly, come quickly, Lord Jesus,
[2571.32 --> 2580.30]  and establish your kingdom in its fullest scope and revelation on this earth in the restoration of all things.
[2584.92 --> 2588.14]  And even as we wait for that day, Lord Jesus,
[2588.14 --> 2592.18]  remind us again,
[2593.26 --> 2595.40]  help us to know
[2595.40 --> 2600.10]  that as you have ascended to the right hand of the Father,
[2600.24 --> 2604.72]  you and the Father have sent your Spirit to us.
[2605.78 --> 2611.00]  And that your very presence is now in us and with us,
[2611.20 --> 2612.44]  alongside of us,
[2612.84 --> 2614.82]  upholding us and sustaining us
[2614.82 --> 2620.06]  and carrying us forward into the plans that you have for us.
[2621.70 --> 2626.56]  Give us that hope afresh tonight,
[2626.74 --> 2628.98]  because you are on the throne.
[2629.18 --> 2632.72]  Give us that hope again today,
[2632.72 --> 2638.08]  because we have encountered your grace here,
[2638.86 --> 2641.04]  in worship and in prayer.
[2641.04 --> 2644.98]  And as we go, Lord Jesus,
[2645.74 --> 2646.52]  may we go
[2646.52 --> 2648.44]  with your name
[2648.44 --> 2650.68]  written on our hearts,
[2650.90 --> 2651.80]  with your name
[2651.80 --> 2654.24]  inscribed on our foreheads,
[2654.32 --> 2655.02]  may we go
[2655.02 --> 2656.20]  as witnesses
[2656.20 --> 2657.84]  of the gospel
[2657.84 --> 2660.02]  into Jerusalem
[2660.02 --> 2661.94]  and to Judea,
[2662.48 --> 2663.14]  to Samaria,
[2663.68 --> 2665.28]  and to all the nations,
[2666.16 --> 2667.52]  including our neighborhoods
[2667.52 --> 2668.72]  in Murrayville
[2668.72 --> 2669.96]  and Langley,
[2670.66 --> 2671.20]  Aldergrove
[2671.20 --> 2672.24]  or Abbotsford,
[2673.60 --> 2673.98]  Surrey,
[2675.02 --> 2676.46]  wherever we come from,
[2676.52 --> 2677.30]  in Walnut Grove
[2677.30 --> 2678.52]  or Maple Ridge,
[2678.60 --> 2679.52]  wherever we come from
[2679.52 --> 2681.48]  in the lower mainland,
[2681.66 --> 2682.34]  wherever we come from
[2682.34 --> 2682.74]  in BC
[2682.74 --> 2683.44]  or Canada
[2683.44 --> 2684.14]  and beyond,
[2684.26 --> 2685.04]  may we go
[2685.04 --> 2686.50]  as witnesses
[2686.50 --> 2688.76]  of the gospel.
[2688.76 --> 2691.26]  and may we go
[2691.26 --> 2691.82]  knowing
[2691.82 --> 2692.70]  that you
[2692.70 --> 2693.56]  go
[2693.56 --> 2694.92]  with us.
[2696.24 --> 2697.34]  Receive the blessing
[2697.34 --> 2699.02]  of our God.
[2701.22 --> 2702.68]  The Lord bless you
[2702.68 --> 2704.64]  and keep you.
[2705.74 --> 2707.06]  The Lord make his face
[2707.06 --> 2707.84]  to shine upon you
[2707.84 --> 2708.68]  and be gracious
[2708.68 --> 2709.76]  to you.
[2710.32 --> 2711.88]  The Lord turn his face
[2711.88 --> 2712.58]  toward you
[2712.58 --> 2713.96]  and give you
[2713.96 --> 2714.96]  his
[2714.96 --> 2716.28]  peace.
[2716.28 --> 2718.58]  Amen.
[2718.76 --> 2737.22]  In Christ alone
[2737.22 --> 2740.86]  my hope is found.
[2740.86 --> 2742.56]  He is my light,
[2742.68 --> 2744.26]  my strength,
[2744.38 --> 2745.60]  my soul.
[2746.08 --> 2748.22]  This cornerstone
[2748.22 --> 2749.92]  is solid,
[2749.92 --> 2751.22]  found
[2751.22 --> 2753.36]  under the fiercest
[2753.36 --> 2755.96]  drought and storm.
[2756.48 --> 2758.98]  What heights of love,
[2759.08 --> 2761.06]  what depths of peace,
[2761.46 --> 2763.68]  when fears are still,
[2764.14 --> 2766.22]  when strivings cease,
[2766.62 --> 2767.92]  my comfort,
[2768.08 --> 2771.66]  my all in all,
[2771.66 --> 2775.10]  here in the love of Christ
[2775.10 --> 2776.48]  I stand.
[2776.48 --> 2789.02]  in Christ alone
[2789.02 --> 2792.06]  who took on flesh,
[2792.06 --> 2793.80]  fullness of God
[2793.80 --> 2796.74]  in helpless gain,
[2796.74 --> 2799.70]  this gift of love
[2799.70 --> 2801.12]  and righteousness,
[2801.12 --> 2804.08]  scorned by the ones
[2804.08 --> 2806.12]  he came to save.
[2806.12 --> 2810.06]  till on that cross
[2810.06 --> 2812.18]  as Jesus died,
[2812.18 --> 2815.12]  the wrath of God
[2815.12 --> 2816.66]  was satisfied,
[2817.66 --> 2819.94]  for every sin
[2819.94 --> 2822.86]  on him was laid,
[2823.32 --> 2824.66]  here in the death
[2824.66 --> 2827.76]  of Christ I live.
[2827.76 --> 2840.30]  there in the ground
[2840.30 --> 2841.14]  in the ground
[2841.14 --> 2843.30]  his body lay,
[2843.30 --> 2845.92]  light of the world
[2845.92 --> 2849.30]  by darkness slain,
[2849.30 --> 2851.30]  then bursting forth
[2851.30 --> 2852.30]  in the ground
[2852.30 --> 2852.84]  and the glory
[2852.84 --> 2855.16]  in the glorious day.
[2855.16 --> 2856.92]  Off from the grave
[2856.92 --> 2859.94]  he rose again,
[2859.94 --> 2863.10]  and as he stands
[2863.10 --> 2864.54]  in victory,
[2865.68 --> 2868.22]  sin's curse has lost
[2868.22 --> 2870.42]  his grip on me,
[2870.76 --> 2873.16]  for I am his,
[2873.44 --> 2876.10]  and he is mine,
[2876.56 --> 2877.98]  bought with the precious
[2877.98 --> 2881.82]  blood of Christ.
[2881.82 --> 2894.30]  No guilt in life,
[2894.36 --> 2896.94]  no fear in death,
[2896.94 --> 2898.70]  this is the power
[2898.70 --> 2901.70]  of Christ in me.
[2901.70 --> 2904.34]  from life's first cry
[2904.34 --> 2907.28]  to final breath,
[2907.28 --> 2909.04]  Jesus commands
[2909.04 --> 2911.36]  my destiny.
[2912.68 --> 2915.24]  No power on heaven,
[2915.32 --> 2917.40]  no scheme of man
[2917.40 --> 2920.82]  can ever flood me
[2920.82 --> 2922.64]  from his hand
[2922.64 --> 2925.46]  till he returns
[2925.46 --> 2928.36]  or calls me home
[2928.36 --> 2930.10]  here in the power
[2930.10 --> 2931.10]  of Christ
[2931.10 --> 2933.10]  I'll stand.
[2933.10 --> 2936.10]  No power of hell,
[2936.10 --> 2938.76]  no scheme of man
[2938.76 --> 2942.54]  can ever pluck me
[2942.54 --> 2944.78]  from his hand
[2944.78 --> 2947.94]  till he returns
[2947.94 --> 2951.52]  or calls me home
[2951.52 --> 2954.26]  here in the power
[2954.26 --> 2956.48]  of Christ
[2956.48 --> 2959.26]  I'll stand.
[2959.34 --> 2979.10]  verse 2
[2979.10 --> 3009.08]  Thank you.
[3009.10 --> 3039.08]  Thank you.
[3039.10 --> 3069.08]  Thank you.
[3069.10 --> 3099.08]  Thank you.
