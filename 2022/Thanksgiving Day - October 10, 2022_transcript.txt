[0.00 --> 5.90]  There is power in the name of Jesus.
[6.38 --> 14.62]  There is power in the name of Jesus.
[15.38 --> 17.94]  Just to break every chain.
[18.38 --> 19.94]  Yes, it will.
[20.48 --> 21.76]  Yes, it will.
[22.18 --> 27.12]  Hey, just to break every chain.
[27.12 --> 29.48]  Break every chain.
[29.48 --> 31.56]  Break every chain.
[31.58 --> 33.44]  Come on, everybody say there is an army.
[33.94 --> 39.72]  There is an army rising up.
[40.74 --> 42.10]  Oh, yeah.
[42.48 --> 48.24]  There is an army rising up.
[48.54 --> 50.44]  Yes, there is an army.
[50.44 --> 56.72]  There is an army rising up.
[57.08 --> 58.82]  Break every chain.
[58.82 --> 61.18]  Break every chain.
[61.18 --> 62.72]  Break every chain.
[66.72 --> 66.76]  Break every chain.
[66.76 --> 68.92]  Break every chain.
[69.10 --> 71.80]  Break every chain.
[71.80 --> 74.20]  Break every chain.
[74.28 --> 78.32]  Now right here in this moment, I'm usually to begin to speak to that thing.
[78.32 --> 80.96]  Come on, call it by its name.
[81.32 --> 84.42]  Come against the spirit of homosexuality.
[84.62 --> 87.82]  Come against the spirit of rejection and depression.
[88.32 --> 90.26]  Somebody release it into the atmosphere.
[90.74 --> 93.26]  And we declare that the chains be broken.
[93.58 --> 95.16]  That the chains be broken.
[95.54 --> 99.24]  The power of life and death lies in your tongue.
[99.56 --> 101.56]  Somebody raise up your voices.
[101.56 --> 106.24]  And you declare that the chains are broken.
[106.24 --> 109.04]  The chains are broken.
[109.42 --> 111.50]  The chains are broken.
[111.92 --> 114.44]  The chains are broken.
[114.66 --> 117.10]  The ends is broken.
[117.46 --> 117.74]  The chains are broken.
[117.96 --> 123.68]  I hear the chains fall.
[128.10 --> 132.44]  I hear the chains fall.
[132.44 --> 139.44]  I hear the chains falling
[139.44 --> 144.44]  I hear the chains falling
[144.44 --> 149.44]  I hear the chains falling
[149.44 --> 153.44]  In the name of Jesus
[153.44 --> 157.44]  I hear the chains falling
[157.44 --> 161.44]  He's waking up and changing
[161.44 --> 167.44]  I hear the chains falling
[167.44 --> 170.44]  I hear it, I hear it in the spirit
[170.44 --> 176.44]  I hear the chains falling
[176.44 --> 178.44]  Come on, you raise it real now
[178.44 --> 183.44]  I hear the chains falling
[183.44 --> 186.44]  Now one more time, let's do it together
[186.44 --> 188.44]  You speak to it
[188.44 --> 190.44]  Come on, speak to it
[190.44 --> 192.44]  In the name of Jesus
[192.44 --> 194.44]  Call it by his name
[194.44 --> 197.44]  We speak to the spirit of cancer
[197.44 --> 200.44]  And we declare that the chains are broken
[200.44 --> 202.44]  Off of every family
[202.44 --> 205.44]  We declare that the chains of poverty
[205.44 --> 207.44]  Is broken off of the kingdom
[207.44 --> 210.44]  Somebody raise up your voices now
[210.44 --> 211.44]  And you declare it
[211.44 --> 213.44]  That the chains of poverty
[213.44 --> 216.44]  Is broken off of the kingdom
[216.44 --> 218.44]  Good morning
[218.44 --> 222.44]  Happy Thanksgiving to all of you here
[222.44 --> 225.44]  And all of you joining us online

[233.44 --> 236.44]  And join with you in worship together
[236.44 --> 238.44]  This morning
[238.44 --> 241.44]  As we come into God's presence

[243.44 --> 245.44]  And as a people welcomed by God himself
[245.44 --> 246.44]  And so as you're able
[246.44 --> 247.44]  And where you are

[252.44 --> 254.44]  With his greeting to us
[254.44 --> 257.44]  On this Thanksgiving Monday
[257.44 --> 259.44]  We give thanks in the name of the Lord
[259.44 --> 260.44]  Who greets us
[260.44 --> 264.44]  Grace, mercy, and peace to you
[264.44 --> 267.44]  From God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
[267.44 --> 269.44]  His Son and our Savior
[269.44 --> 272.44]  Through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit
[272.44 --> 273.44]  Amen
[274.44 --> 277.44]  We are here together as a church family
[277.44 --> 279.44]  And as friends and family to worship God
[279.44 --> 282.44]  So I'm going to invite you to turn to those around you
[282.44 --> 284.44]  To greet them and welcome them in worship
[284.44 --> 287.44]  With a fist bump, a handshake, or a hug
[287.44 --> 289.44]  Passing the peace of Christ
[312.44 --> 327.44]  Our call to worship this morning
[327.44 --> 330.44]  Comes from Psalm 136
[332.44 --> 335.44]  Give thanks to the Lord for he is good
[335.44 --> 337.44]  His love endures forever
[338.44 --> 340.44]  There's so much packed into this simple phrase
[340.44 --> 341.44]  Hear it again
[341.44 --> 344.44]  Give thanks to the Lord for he is good
[344.44 --> 347.44]  His love endures forever
[347.44 --> 350.44]  As we sing our songs of worship this morning
[350.44 --> 353.44]  I hope we can meditate on these words
[353.44 --> 356.44]  That we can rest in God's goodness
[356.44 --> 358.44]  And enjoy his love for us
[358.44 --> 360.44]  A love that endures forever
[361.44 --> 364.44]  Give thanks to the Lord for he is good
[364.44 --> 366.44]  His love endures forever
[366.44 --> 368.44]  My love and I don't know
[368.44 --> 369.44]  My love and I would pray
[369.44 --> 371.44]  Praise God
[371.44 --> 372.44]  And enjoy it

[2614.20 --> 2616.20]  Thank you.
[2644.20 --> 2674.18]  Thank you.
[2674.20 --> 2704.20]  from 2nd,
[2704.20 --> 2734.20] 
[2734.20 --> 2764.20] 
[2764.20 --> 2794.18]  Thank you.
[2794.18 --> 2824.18]  Thank you.
[2824.18 --> 2854.16]  Thank you.
[2854.18 --> 2884.18]  Thank you.
[2884.18 --> 2914.18]  Thank you.
[2914.18 --> 2944.18]  Thank you.
[2944.18 --> 2974.18]  Thank you.
[2974.18 --> 3004.18]  Thank you.
[3004.18 --> 3034.18]  Thank you.
[3034.18 --> 3064.18]  Thank you.
[3064.18 --> 3094.18]  Thank you.
[3094.18 --> 3124.18]  Thank you.
[3124.18 --> 3154.18]  Thank you.
[3154.18 --> 3184.18]  Look at you.
[3184.18 --> 3214.18]  Thank you.
[3214.18 --> 3244.18]  Thank you.
[3244.18 --> 3274.18]  Thank you.
[3274.18 --> 3304.18]  Thank you.
[3304.18 --> 3305.60]  of you.
[3334.18 --> 3342.64]  harvest of your righteousness. Now, righteousness is one of those Bible words that we sometimes
[3342.64 --> 3349.06]  just say and don't have an idea of what it means. And I like to think of righteousness is right
[3349.06 --> 3356.84]  action towards the glory of God. Right? So we do what God has called us and what is obedient to
[3356.84 --> 3365.28]  him and we do it for his glory. Now, that's my normal operating and shared definition of
[3365.28 --> 3371.00]  righteousness, but I think there's something deeper here than even that. Right? I think actually that
[3371.00 --> 3380.06]  Paul, when he is writing this section of scripture, he has in mind Hosea 10 verse 12. Hosea 10 verse 12,
[3380.06 --> 3388.06]  a minor prophet in the Old Testament. He says, sow righteousness for yourselves, reap the fruit of
[3388.06 --> 3394.46]  unfailing love, and break up your unplowed ground, for it is time to seek the Lord until he comes
[3394.46 --> 3402.28]  and showers his righteousness on you. The Greek translation of Hosea from the second century
[3402.28 --> 3407.76]  BC is the same as what Paul writes here, that showers his righteousness on you in Greek is
[3407.76 --> 3413.56]  increases the harvest of your righteousness. And Paul, who wrote 2 Corinthians as a trained
[3413.56 --> 3422.32]  Hebrew Pharisee, would have these words memorized both in Hebrew and probably in Greek. And so I think
[3422.32 --> 3430.44]  when he's writing this, this frame, this expression is rolling around in his mind and they just ring out
[3430.44 --> 3437.58]  in what he says here. And so what is the harvest of your righteousness? Right? It's more than just
[3437.58 --> 3443.52]  right action for the glory of God. It's actually taking Hosea, it's the fruit of unfailing love.
[3444.94 --> 3451.32]  In fact, John Calvin will take this idea and he calls the harvest of righteousness, the work and office
[3451.32 --> 3459.34]  of love. And so what makes a uniquely Christian thanksgiving is God using it to increase, not your stuff,
[3459.34 --> 3469.44]  but your love for others, right? Your love for him. Christian generosity is about Christian love.
[3469.58 --> 3475.54]  Christian cheerfulness is about Christian love. Christian thanksgiving is about Christian love.
[3476.28 --> 3482.54]  Not the self-idolizing love of the world for itself, but the self-giving love of Jesus for the world.
[3482.54 --> 3491.58]  And so now we begin to see it, right? Thanksgiving is properly about how you can love the world.
[3492.78 --> 3497.96]  That's what makes thanksgiving uniquely Christian. That's our unique expression and what we can offer
[3497.96 --> 3503.86]  here, right? God gives you stuff and some of you abundantly, wealth, riches, possessions,
[3503.86 --> 3513.46]  so that you can give it away in his name for his glory. Thanksgiving for the Christian looks like
[3513.46 --> 3523.52]  giving blessing away. The second thing then that makes thanksgiving uniquely Christian is in verse 13.
[3524.52 --> 3526.92]  Verse 13, we read,
[3526.92 --> 3548.72]  Christian thanksgiving, Christian generosity, Christian cheerfulness. That's part of what it means when he says
[3548.72 --> 3552.84]  the obedience that accompanies your confession. Christian thanksgiving, Christian generosity,
[3552.84 --> 3561.48]  Christian cheerfulness will lead people to praise God, right? And that will start here. As we see that
[3561.48 --> 3567.40]  happening in our midst and in each other, we will be led to praise God. And then that spills out
[3567.40 --> 3573.60]  to your neighborhoods and your workplaces and your third places, whatever they happen to be. People will
[3573.60 --> 3579.90]  look at your life and not because of how rich you are or how blessed you are or however many earthly reasons
[3579.90 --> 3585.58]  you have to be thankful. People will look at your life and they will see you giving it away. They will
[3585.58 --> 3592.78]  see you loving others and they will say, God be praised. And again, not because of the stuff,
[3593.42 --> 3594.78]  but because of how you hold yourself.
[3596.94 --> 3603.88]  Because even in death, you have no fear. Even in poverty, you have the riches of the kingdom of heaven.
[3603.88 --> 3611.74]  Even in sickness, we have God's presence. And when you have Jesus, even if you have nothing else,
[3611.96 --> 3617.68]  you can still be generous and thankful and cheerful, right? That's what makes uniquely Christian
[3617.68 --> 3623.34]  thanksgiving. When by the world's standards, you have nothing to be thankful for, and yet you are.
[3624.56 --> 3630.00]  Right? When by the world's standards, you have nothing to give, and yet you do. When you have nothing
[3630.00 --> 3639.18]  to be cheerful about, and yet you can't stop rejoicing at God your Savior. Even as the cost of
[3639.18 --> 3645.36]  living feels like it's skyrocketing, and I shouldn't even say feels like there because the CPI over the
[3645.36 --> 3652.56]  last year has gone up by 8.4 or some odd percent. Like it's, even if you lose your job or you're
[3652.56 --> 3658.84]  underemployed, even if you have cancer or some other terminal disease, Christians can say,
[3658.84 --> 3663.12]  thanks be to God for his indescribable gift.
[3665.46 --> 3670.18]  Now, that's not saying the cost of living is a gift of God, or the increased cost of living is a
[3670.18 --> 3675.16]  gift from God. That's not saying that, you know, the division that exists in the world through which
[3675.16 --> 3679.40]  we can still be grateful is a gift from God. That's not saying cancer is a gift from God.
[3679.66 --> 3684.34]  Obviously not. What it is saying is that the gift of God far outweighs all of those things,
[3684.34 --> 3689.08]  right? The goodness of God and the gift of his grace are of an eternal weight and glory,
[3689.08 --> 3693.04]  and they far surpass any earthly treasure and any present suffering.
[3695.16 --> 3701.24]  That's what makes our Thanksgiving uniquely Christian. This is the truth of what it means
[3701.24 --> 3707.26]  to be Christian this Thanksgiving, that we know Jesus, that we know the gospel, that we know that
[3707.26 --> 3712.22]  Jesus lived the life I should have lived, and that he gives me his righteousness, that we know that
[3712.22 --> 3718.12]  Jesus died the death that I deserve, and that he takes the wrath of God for my sin on his shoulders.
[3720.26 --> 3728.76]  Today, this Thanksgiving day, is uniquely Christian when you cling to the grace of God.
[3729.90 --> 3737.26]  Thanksgiving for us is uniquely Christian because God uses it to increase love in us,
[3737.26 --> 3743.44]  his love for us, his love for us, our love for him, and our love for others through him.
[3744.80 --> 3752.56]  Because of his love, we are generous. Because of his love, we are thankful. Because of his love,
[3752.68 --> 3760.12]  we are cheerful. Thanksgiving is uniquely Christian because God uses the thankful, cheerful, generous life
[3760.12 --> 3770.00]  to lead others to praise him. And so today, or if it was yesterday, right, whether you sit with family
[3770.00 --> 3779.28]  or if you sit by yourselves, may people look at your life and say, God be praised. Today, when you say,
[3779.28 --> 3786.42]  happy Thanksgiving, may everyone who hears that know the love of God in your words.
[3786.42 --> 3797.00]  And today, and every day forward, may you be generous and cheerful and thankful as God increases the harvest
[3797.00 --> 3808.16]  of your righteousness so that others will praise him. That is a uniquely Christian Thanksgiving. Amen.
[3808.88 --> 3809.74]  Let's pray together.
[3809.74 --> 3821.10]  Holy God, Heavenly Father, increase the harvest of your righteousness among us.
