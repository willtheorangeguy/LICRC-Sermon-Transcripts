[1831.88 --> 1836.46]  And His mercy never ends
[1836.46 --> 1841.46]  He reminds me every morning
[1842.04 --> 1846.46]  I am still Your faithful friend
[1846.46 --> 1852.46]  He is good to those who see Him
[1852.46 --> 1856.46]  I will wait for Him to bless
[1856.98 --> 1862.46]  And the Lord will be my portion
[1862.46 --> 1866.32]  In the empty wilderness
[1866.32 --> 1872.46]  In the goodness of the Lord
[1872.46 --> 1877.46]  In the goodness of the Lord
[1877.46 --> 1882.46]  I will wait for Him and send my love
[1882.46 --> 1887.46]  In the goodness of the Lord
[1887.46 --> 1894.46]  In the goodness of the Lord
[1894.46 --> 1898.46]  In the goodness of the Lord
[1898.46 --> 1903.46]  I will wait for Him and send my hope
[1903.46 --> 1908.46]  In the goodness of the Lord
[1908.46 --> 1909.46]  And the goodness of the Lord
[1909.46 --> 1910.46]  In the goodness of the Lord
[1910.46 --> 1912.46]  In the goodness of the Lord
[1912.46 --> 1920.46]  There it is.
[1920.46 --> 1924.46]  I would love to invite all the kids to come forward up here just for a second.
[1924.46 --> 1926.46]  And we're going to... Hi Haley.
[1926.46 --> 1928.46]  And we're going to do the kids' blessings.
[1928.46 --> 1929.46]  So come on up.
[1929.46 --> 1931.46]  Come on up to the front if you want.
[1931.46 --> 1935.46]  All right.
[1935.46 --> 1938.46]  You are right there.
[1938.46 --> 1939.46]  Nice and close.
[1939.46 --> 1940.46]  How's everybody doing?
[1940.46 --> 1942.46]  Yeah, we're doing well?
[1942.46 --> 1943.46]  That's good.
[1943.46 --> 1944.46]  There's a few more coming I think.
[1944.46 --> 1946.46]  Oh, maybe, maybe not.
[1946.46 --> 1947.46]  All right.
[1947.46 --> 1949.46]  We are going to do children's worship time today.
[1949.46 --> 1952.46]  So if you are three years old or going into kindergarten,
[1952.46 --> 1955.46]  you're allowed to go to children's worship time.
[1955.46 --> 1957.46]  And otherwise we're going to listen to Pastor Chris today.
[1957.46 --> 1960.46]  He's going to talk about a parable of the Good Samaritan.
[1960.46 --> 1962.46]  We're going to listen to that this morning.
[1962.46 --> 1963.46]  Does that sound good?
[1963.46 --> 1964.46]  Yeah.
[1964.46 --> 1965.46]  Okay, but first I'm going to pray.
[1965.46 --> 1968.46]  And then we're going to do the kids' blessing, children's blessing.
[1968.46 --> 1969.46]  Okay, are you ready?
[1969.46 --> 1971.46]  So let's fold our hands, close our eyes, and let's pray.
[1971.46 --> 1972.46]  Dear God, we thank you for this day.
[1972.46 --> 1974.46]  That we could come to church.
[1974.46 --> 1978.46]  Thank you that we have teachers here who are going to teach us more about you.
[1978.46 --> 1982.46]  And if we're in children's worship time, God, we pray that you'll help us open our hearts
[1982.46 --> 1984.46]  to what it is that we are to learn there.
[1984.46 --> 1988.46]  And if we're staying in the church, please be with Pastor Chris as he brings us your word
[1988.46 --> 1991.46]  and help us listen to what it is that you are telling us today.
[1991.46 --> 1993.46]  So we pray this all in your son's name.
[1993.46 --> 1994.46]  Amen.
[1994.46 --> 1996.46]  Okay, we're going to stand up and we're going to do the blessing, okay?
[1996.46 --> 2001.46]  So stand up, hold your hands out, and we're going to say it together.
[2001.46 --> 2002.46]  Are you ready?
[2002.46 --> 2003.46]  The Lord be with you.
[2003.46 --> 2004.46]  Are you ready?
[2004.46 --> 2005.46]  Let's do that.
[2005.46 --> 2007.46]  The Lord be with you.
[2007.46 --> 2009.46]  All right.
[2009.46 --> 2010.46]  Good morning.
[2010.46 --> 2011.46]  My name is Darrell.
[2011.46 --> 2012.46]  I'm one of the elders here.
[2012.46 --> 2014.46]  Let's go to God in our church family prayer.
[2014.46 --> 2015.46]  Dear Heavenly Father, we gather before you.
[2015.46 --> 2016.46]  Let's go to God in our church family prayer.
[2016.46 --> 2017.46]  Let's go to God in our church family prayer.
[2017.46 --> 2019.46]  Let's go to God in our church family prayer.
[2019.46 --> 2022.46]  Dear Heavenly Father, we gather before you this morning as your people, and we praise you for
[2022.46 --> 2023.46]  the many blessings you have given us.
[2023.46 --> 2024.46]  Let's go to God in our church family prayer.
[2024.46 --> 2026.46]  Let's go to God in our church family prayer.
[2026.46 --> 2028.46]  Let's go to God in our church family prayer.
[2028.46 --> 2029.46]  Let's go to God in our church family prayer.
[2029.46 --> 2035.46]  Let's go to God in our church family prayer.
[2035.46 --> 2038.46]  Let's go to God in our church family prayer.
[2038.64 --> 2058.42]  Let's go to God in our church family prayer prayer prayer prayer prayer prayer prayer prayer prayer prayer prayer prayer prayer prayer prayer prayer prayer prayer prayer prayer prayer prayer prayer
[2058.42 --> 2065.66]  continue to mourn. Please comfort us and be near to us. Please also be with Harry Bauman as he
[2065.66 --> 2070.50]  continues to heal from a work accident, and thank you for the healing he's had so far.
[2071.72 --> 2077.74]  We pray for those who struggle with COVID right now and other illnesses, including mental illness,
[2077.74 --> 2083.18]  just please give them an extra measure of your healing. Remind us as a church to surround them
[2083.18 --> 2090.04]  and comfort them, for we are your hands and feet. Truly my soul finds rest in God. My salvation
[2090.04 --> 2096.44]  comes from him. Truly he is my fortress. I will never be shaken. How long will you assault me?
[2097.48 --> 2103.26]  Would all of you throw me down this leaning wall, this tottering fence? Surely they intend to topple
[2103.26 --> 2108.88]  me from my lofty place. They take delight in lies. With their mouths they bless, but in their hearts
[2108.88 --> 2116.42]  they curse. Yes, my soul finds rest in God. My hope comes from him. Truly he is my rock and my salvation.
[2116.66 --> 2123.30]  He is my fortress. I will not be shaken. My salvation and my honor depend on God. He is my mighty rock,
[2123.44 --> 2129.72]  my refuge. Trust in him at all times, you people. Pour out your hearts to him, for God is our refuge.
[2130.64 --> 2135.80]  God Almighty, we lift our church leaders to you. We pray for Pastor Chris, Kevin, and Josh, the elders,
[2135.80 --> 2140.96]  deacons, teachers, and ministry leaders. Instill shepherds' hearts in them. Inspire them to dig deep
[2140.96 --> 2145.08]  into your word and root their lives in you alone. Protect their families and time with their families.
[2145.26 --> 2150.00]  We pray for humility as they lead. Pour out your grace and generosity in them and through them.
[2150.44 --> 2155.62]  Preserve their witness. Lead them as they walk with you and give them capacity to showcase your love,
[2155.92 --> 2160.00]  mercy, and forgiveness. Provide accountability as they lead us and compel us to be faithful,
[2160.28 --> 2164.40]  to stand in the gap for them. We praise you for the leaders you have raised up in this church.
[2164.40 --> 2167.84]  Please be with Pastor Chris as he gives us your word this morning,
[2168.28 --> 2173.22]  and may you open our hearts and give us ears to hear. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[2194.40 --> 2207.86]  This morning we're going to read together and reflect on the parable of the Good Samaritan.
[2208.54 --> 2217.78]  A very familiar one to many of you, I'm sure. And because of its familiarity, I'm going to ask that you,
[2217.78 --> 2221.34]  if you have a Bible with you or a phone that you can read on,
[2221.46 --> 2228.16]  that you intentionally open that up and check and follow along there,
[2228.38 --> 2238.04]  so that we can hopefully together push through the familiarity of this story and parable together.
[2238.04 --> 2246.46]  There are a couple of parables that Jesus speaks that he gives as an answer to a question.
[2247.00 --> 2251.22]  And there are some parables that we have recorded that are just told as a story,
[2251.32 --> 2254.00]  and he spoke to them in another parable, and he spoke to them in another parable.
[2254.32 --> 2259.08]  This is one of those parables where Jesus is giving an answer to a question.
[2259.24 --> 2265.50]  And so for us to fully dive into the parable, we're going to start with the context,
[2265.50 --> 2272.78]  with the question that was asked of Jesus, so that we can see how his answer fits in that regard.
[2273.26 --> 2277.54]  And so, with your Bibles open and your hearts open to the Word of God,
[2277.88 --> 2281.20]  from Luke 10, let's read starting at verse 25.
[2283.90 --> 2288.90]  On one occasion, an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus.
[2288.90 --> 2295.70]  Teacher, he asked, what must I do to inherit eternal life?
[2297.38 --> 2299.66]  What is written in the law, Jesus replied.
[2299.78 --> 2300.64]  How do you read it?
[2303.00 --> 2304.62]  The expert in the law answered,
[2305.38 --> 2308.64]  Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul
[2308.64 --> 2310.80]  and with all your strength and all your mind,
[2311.24 --> 2313.82]  and love your neighbor as yourself.
[2313.82 --> 2318.44]  You have answered correctly, Jesus said.
[2318.64 --> 2320.66]  Do this and you will live.
[2322.22 --> 2325.08]  But he wanted to justify himself,
[2325.26 --> 2326.68]  and so he asked Jesus,
[2327.46 --> 2330.38]  And who is my neighbor?
[2331.66 --> 2334.28]  And in reply, Jesus said,
[2334.28 --> 2339.54]  A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho
[2339.54 --> 2342.14]  when he was attacked by robbers.
[2342.14 --> 2345.02]  They stripped him of his clothes,
[2345.18 --> 2346.68]  beat him, and went away,
[2346.84 --> 2348.36]  leaving him half dead.
[2349.86 --> 2352.56]  A priest happened to be going down the same road,
[2352.66 --> 2353.86]  and when he saw the man,
[2353.96 --> 2356.32]  he passed by on the other side.
[2357.60 --> 2359.66]  So too, a Levite,
[2360.18 --> 2362.14]  when he came to the place and saw him,
[2362.32 --> 2364.56]  he passed by on the other side.
[2365.78 --> 2367.52]  But a Samaritan,
[2368.24 --> 2369.52]  as he traveled,
[2370.06 --> 2371.52]  came where the man was,
[2371.52 --> 2373.08]  and when he saw him,
[2373.16 --> 2374.52]  he took pity on him.
[2375.34 --> 2377.68]  He went to him and bandaged his wounds,
[2378.16 --> 2379.90]  pouring on oil and wine.
[2380.42 --> 2382.34]  And then he put the man on his own donkey
[2382.34 --> 2384.92]  and brought him to an inn and took care of him.
[2385.88 --> 2386.82]  The next day,
[2386.90 --> 2388.44]  he took out two denarii
[2388.44 --> 2389.88]  and gave them to the innkeeper.
[2390.22 --> 2391.80]  Look after him, he said,
[2392.38 --> 2393.48]  and when I return,
[2393.66 --> 2396.68]  I will reimburse you for any extra expense
[2396.68 --> 2397.50]  you may have.
[2397.50 --> 2401.80]  Which of these three do you think
[2401.80 --> 2403.28]  was a neighbor to the man
[2403.28 --> 2405.76]  who fell into the hands of the robbers?
[2407.32 --> 2409.24]  The expert in the law replied,
[2410.46 --> 2412.76]  the one who had mercy on him.
[2414.04 --> 2415.16]  Jesus told him,
[2415.64 --> 2417.46]  go and do likewise.
[2418.92 --> 2420.20]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2420.20 --> 2427.44]  Now,
[2427.68 --> 2431.98]  the parable of the Good Samaritan,
[2432.20 --> 2433.00]  as I have said,
[2433.50 --> 2435.00]  is famous,
[2435.48 --> 2436.04]  in part,
[2436.16 --> 2437.94]  for its simplicity.
[2438.68 --> 2438.82]  Right?
[2438.86 --> 2440.98]  It is probably one of the
[2440.98 --> 2442.86]  most well-known parables
[2442.86 --> 2443.82]  of Jesus.
[2444.02 --> 2444.52]  And that's true,
[2444.60 --> 2447.16]  even for people who don't go to church.
[2447.16 --> 2451.24]  And especially pertinent for us today,
[2451.68 --> 2453.46]  this parable is biting
[2453.46 --> 2454.88]  in its critique
[2454.88 --> 2456.42]  of religious people.
[2458.06 --> 2459.10]  And yet,
[2459.88 --> 2463.04]  precisely because of all those reasons,
[2463.88 --> 2464.14]  right,
[2464.22 --> 2465.84]  most of us here today
[2465.84 --> 2468.04]  are religious people.
[2468.50 --> 2469.74]  Many of us here
[2469.74 --> 2470.92]  have heard this story
[2470.92 --> 2471.98]  since we were kids.
[2472.44 --> 2473.78]  And because it seems
[2473.78 --> 2474.84]  so straightforward,
[2474.84 --> 2479.40]  we are more apt
[2479.40 --> 2480.34]  or more likely
[2480.34 --> 2481.70]  to miss
[2481.70 --> 2483.64]  what this parable has to say.
[2484.82 --> 2485.52]  Now, remember,
[2486.26 --> 2487.70]  as we begin in this
[2487.70 --> 2488.28]  parables,
[2488.48 --> 2489.30]  the summer series,
[2489.66 --> 2489.82]  right,
[2489.86 --> 2490.88]  we said that Jesus
[2490.88 --> 2492.80]  uses parables
[2492.80 --> 2493.98]  in some respect
[2493.98 --> 2495.34]  to intentionally
[2495.34 --> 2496.26]  confuse
[2496.26 --> 2497.28]  the people
[2497.28 --> 2498.10]  who aren't yet
[2498.10 --> 2498.96]  his disciples
[2498.96 --> 2499.90]  or who don't yet
[2499.90 --> 2501.00]  believe in him.
[2502.20 --> 2502.88]  And so,
[2503.22 --> 2504.36]  I suggest to you
[2504.36 --> 2505.50]  that if we
[2505.50 --> 2506.48]  oversimplify
[2506.48 --> 2507.32]  this parable
[2507.32 --> 2508.54]  into something
[2508.54 --> 2509.38]  that makes
[2509.38 --> 2510.68]  intuitive sense
[2510.68 --> 2511.86]  to everyone,
[2512.22 --> 2513.32]  including non-believing,
[2513.46 --> 2514.38]  non-churchgoing people,
[2514.52 --> 2515.94]  we probably haven't
[2515.94 --> 2517.18]  fully grasped
[2517.18 --> 2518.88]  or fully understood
[2518.88 --> 2519.74]  the parable.
[2521.42 --> 2522.10]  Now,
[2522.14 --> 2522.82]  that's one of the reasons
[2522.82 --> 2523.62]  why I love
[2523.62 --> 2524.60]  parables.
[2525.10 --> 2526.06]  Because no matter
[2526.06 --> 2527.34]  how long you've been around,
[2527.40 --> 2527.98]  no matter how familiar
[2527.98 --> 2528.36]  you are
[2528.36 --> 2529.70]  with these stories,
[2530.12 --> 2530.24]  right,
[2530.24 --> 2531.30]  there's always something
[2531.30 --> 2532.72]  new to plumb
[2532.72 --> 2533.64]  from them
[2533.64 --> 2534.32]  that makes,
[2534.54 --> 2535.14]  as we said,
[2535.18 --> 2536.42]  a theological point
[2536.42 --> 2537.30]  out of the world
[2537.30 --> 2538.42]  around us.
[2539.00 --> 2539.78]  This morning,
[2540.02 --> 2541.34]  we are going to be
[2541.34 --> 2541.92]  intentional
[2541.92 --> 2543.04]  and we're going to
[2543.04 --> 2543.60]  dig deep
[2543.60 --> 2544.24]  and so,
[2545.00 --> 2546.14]  I wrote here
[2546.14 --> 2546.66]  in my notes,
[2546.80 --> 2547.68]  roll up your sleeves,
[2547.80 --> 2548.38]  but most of us
[2548.38 --> 2549.12]  are wearing t-shirts
[2549.12 --> 2550.00]  today because it's
[2550.00 --> 2550.56]  so hot out,
[2550.64 --> 2551.78]  so get ready
[2551.78 --> 2552.68]  and let's go to work.
[2554.44 --> 2555.84]  To shape our time
[2555.84 --> 2557.08]  this morning,
[2557.24 --> 2558.60]  I've got three questions
[2558.60 --> 2559.32]  that are going to
[2559.32 --> 2559.88]  structure
[2559.88 --> 2561.38]  how I move forward.
[2562.16 --> 2563.16]  The first question
[2563.16 --> 2563.98]  is,
[2564.48 --> 2565.64]  how is love
[2565.64 --> 2566.48]  for God
[2566.48 --> 2567.66]  made real?
[2568.52 --> 2569.24]  How is love
[2569.24 --> 2569.74]  for God
[2569.74 --> 2570.30]  made real?
[2570.80 --> 2572.00]  And then the second question,
[2572.18 --> 2572.94]  we'll follow up
[2572.94 --> 2573.28]  out of that,
[2573.34 --> 2573.58]  asking,
[2573.90 --> 2574.74]  who is my neighbor?
[2575.88 --> 2577.32]  And then the third question
[2577.32 --> 2577.74]  is,
[2578.06 --> 2579.04]  how does
[2579.04 --> 2580.06]  the Good Samaritan,
[2580.20 --> 2581.64]  the story of the Good Samaritan
[2581.64 --> 2582.78]  or the Good Samaritan
[2582.78 --> 2583.42]  himself,
[2583.96 --> 2585.76]  change my life?
[2586.58 --> 2586.74]  So,
[2586.84 --> 2587.20]  how is love
[2587.20 --> 2587.50]  for God
[2587.50 --> 2588.04]  made real?
[2588.26 --> 2589.20]  Who is my neighbor?
[2589.20 --> 2589.86]  And then how does
[2589.86 --> 2591.48]  this change my life?
[2592.06 --> 2592.64]  Let's start here
[2592.64 --> 2593.34]  in the first question.
[2594.24 --> 2595.14]  How is love
[2595.14 --> 2595.72]  for God
[2595.72 --> 2596.88]  made real?
[2597.84 --> 2598.04]  Now,
[2598.12 --> 2598.98]  first thing to see,
[2599.14 --> 2599.54]  notice
[2599.54 --> 2601.12]  what Jesus
[2601.12 --> 2602.24]  is doing here.
[2602.36 --> 2603.34]  Jesus asks
[2603.34 --> 2604.16]  the expert
[2604.16 --> 2604.92]  in the law
[2604.92 --> 2606.22]  to summarize
[2606.22 --> 2607.36]  the law.
[2608.12 --> 2608.78]  And the expert
[2608.78 --> 2609.68]  gives the answer,
[2609.90 --> 2610.56]  love the Lord
[2610.56 --> 2611.10]  your God
[2611.10 --> 2612.06]  with all your heart
[2612.06 --> 2612.82]  and with all your soul
[2612.82 --> 2613.62]  and with all your strength
[2613.62 --> 2614.42]  and with all your mind
[2614.42 --> 2616.40]  and love your neighbor
[2616.40 --> 2617.86]  as yourself.
[2617.86 --> 2621.06]  this is the exact
[2621.06 --> 2622.12]  same summary
[2622.12 --> 2623.08]  of the law
[2623.08 --> 2624.20]  that Jesus gives
[2624.20 --> 2625.84]  in Matthew 22.
[2627.14 --> 2628.30]  Some scholars
[2628.30 --> 2629.06]  speculate
[2629.06 --> 2630.82]  that this expert
[2630.82 --> 2631.58]  in the law
[2631.58 --> 2632.72]  heard Jesus
[2632.72 --> 2633.96]  give that summary
[2633.96 --> 2635.24]  and so
[2635.24 --> 2635.90]  when Jesus
[2635.90 --> 2636.90]  asked him that question
[2636.90 --> 2638.16]  he knew the right answer
[2638.16 --> 2639.40]  or knew the right answer.
[2640.76 --> 2641.32]  And,
[2641.42 --> 2642.36]  I want to suggest
[2642.36 --> 2643.96]  that the order,
[2644.68 --> 2644.86]  right,
[2644.96 --> 2645.58]  love God
[2645.58 --> 2646.52]  and love neighbor
[2646.52 --> 2647.64]  matters.
[2649.26 --> 2649.48]  Now,
[2649.74 --> 2651.04]  if you are familiar
[2651.04 --> 2651.78]  with your Bibles
[2651.78 --> 2653.06]  you might recognize this
[2653.06 --> 2655.26]  but that love your neighbor
[2655.26 --> 2655.74]  quote
[2655.74 --> 2656.82]  is from
[2656.82 --> 2658.74]  Leviticus 19
[2658.74 --> 2659.90]  verse 18.
[2660.68 --> 2662.18]  And the love your God
[2662.18 --> 2662.60]  quote
[2662.60 --> 2664.16]  is from
[2664.16 --> 2665.96]  Deuteronomy 6
[2665.96 --> 2667.02]  verse 5.
[2667.94 --> 2668.20]  Now,
[2668.96 --> 2669.96]  here's a little
[2669.96 --> 2670.78]  Bible trivia
[2670.78 --> 2671.80]  question for you.
[2671.80 --> 2673.10]  What comes first?
[2673.70 --> 2674.48]  The book of Leviticus
[2674.48 --> 2675.70]  or the book of Deuteronomy?
[2677.90 --> 2678.50]  Leviticus.
[2678.62 --> 2679.10]  Very good.
[2679.92 --> 2681.14]  We said it with enough confidence
[2681.14 --> 2682.06]  that nobody threw out
[2682.06 --> 2682.56]  Deuteronomy
[2682.56 --> 2683.32]  just to make sure
[2683.32 --> 2683.80]  that we covered
[2683.80 --> 2684.48]  all of our bases.
[2685.28 --> 2685.72]  That's right.
[2685.80 --> 2686.92]  Leviticus comes first.
[2687.38 --> 2687.90]  And so,
[2688.30 --> 2690.30]  for a good Jewish rabbi
[2690.30 --> 2691.44]  you would expect
[2691.44 --> 2692.78]  that scripture quotes
[2692.78 --> 2693.20]  given
[2693.20 --> 2694.22]  would follow
[2694.22 --> 2695.16]  the order
[2695.16 --> 2695.78]  that they appear
[2695.78 --> 2696.28]  in the Bible.
[2696.98 --> 2697.64]  They would follow
[2697.64 --> 2699.10]  the canonical order
[2699.10 --> 2699.78]  but Jesus
[2699.78 --> 2700.78]  inverts them.
[2702.46 --> 2702.58]  Now,
[2702.58 --> 2703.28]  why is that?
[2705.20 --> 2705.52]  That's because
[2705.52 --> 2706.32]  I suggest
[2706.32 --> 2707.54]  Jesus is recognizing
[2707.54 --> 2708.14]  and knows
[2708.14 --> 2709.94]  that it's really hard
[2709.94 --> 2711.24]  to love
[2711.24 --> 2713.28]  the unlovely neighbor
[2713.28 --> 2714.50]  unless
[2714.50 --> 2715.74]  you are
[2715.74 --> 2716.44]  filled
[2716.44 --> 2717.68]  to overflowing
[2717.68 --> 2718.96]  with the love
[2718.96 --> 2719.62]  of God
[2719.62 --> 2720.34]  first.
[2721.60 --> 2722.08]  Right?
[2722.10 --> 2722.70]  It's really hard
[2722.70 --> 2723.16]  to love
[2723.16 --> 2724.34]  the unloving
[2724.34 --> 2725.62]  or unlovely
[2725.62 --> 2726.36]  neighbor
[2726.36 --> 2727.70]  unless God
[2727.70 --> 2728.26]  has filled you
[2728.26 --> 2729.00]  with His love
[2729.00 --> 2730.28]  in the first place.
[2730.34 --> 2730.88]  There's a sort of
[2730.88 --> 2732.02]  order of operations
[2732.02 --> 2733.06]  here, right?
[2733.10 --> 2734.10]  You are truly
[2734.10 --> 2736.28]  able to love God
[2736.28 --> 2736.96]  that is with all your
[2736.96 --> 2737.68]  heart and soul
[2737.68 --> 2738.72]  mind and strength
[2738.72 --> 2740.86]  only when His love
[2740.86 --> 2741.68]  for you
[2741.68 --> 2742.60]  fills you up
[2742.60 --> 2743.92]  in newness of life
[2743.92 --> 2745.06]  and then that love
[2745.06 --> 2746.64]  of God for you
[2746.64 --> 2748.26]  so fills you up
[2748.26 --> 2749.58]  that it naturally
[2749.58 --> 2751.00]  and consequently
[2751.00 --> 2753.10]  flows out
[2753.10 --> 2753.82]  to others
[2753.82 --> 2755.26]  to neighbors
[2755.26 --> 2756.24]  and to strangers
[2756.24 --> 2757.48]  and to aliens
[2757.48 --> 2758.58]  and even
[2758.58 --> 2759.54]  Jesus will add
[2759.54 --> 2760.58]  to enemies.
[2762.26 --> 2762.96]  And I want to be
[2762.96 --> 2763.52]  really clear
[2763.52 --> 2765.06]  because this
[2765.06 --> 2766.00]  is the kind
[2766.00 --> 2766.78]  of love
[2766.78 --> 2767.82]  that God
[2767.82 --> 2768.66]  has for you.
[2770.60 --> 2771.12]  And so
[2771.12 --> 2771.72]  wherever our sleeves
[2771.72 --> 2772.24]  are rolled up
[2772.24 --> 2772.60]  we're going to do
[2772.60 --> 2773.84]  some biblical theology
[2773.84 --> 2774.40]  for a minute
[2774.40 --> 2774.98]  and so just
[2774.98 --> 2775.60]  come along
[2775.60 --> 2776.40]  this journey
[2776.40 --> 2776.84]  with me.
[2777.68 --> 2778.60]  Paul says
[2778.60 --> 2780.20]  in Romans 5
[2780.20 --> 2781.44]  he writes
[2781.44 --> 2783.08]  God demonstrates
[2783.08 --> 2784.14]  His own love
[2784.14 --> 2784.66]  for us
[2784.66 --> 2785.22]  in this
[2785.22 --> 2786.24]  that while
[2786.24 --> 2786.92]  we were yet
[2786.92 --> 2787.28]  sinners
[2787.28 --> 2788.92]  Christ died
[2788.92 --> 2789.62]  for us.
[2790.32 --> 2791.04]  And then almost
[2791.04 --> 2791.70]  in the next
[2791.70 --> 2792.54]  verse
[2792.54 --> 2793.62]  he says
[2793.62 --> 2794.94]  while we were
[2794.94 --> 2795.90]  God's enemies
[2795.90 --> 2797.62]  we were reconciled
[2797.62 --> 2798.12]  to Him
[2798.12 --> 2799.08]  through the death
[2799.08 --> 2800.10]  of His Son.
[2801.00 --> 2801.64]  And so hold those
[2801.64 --> 2802.32]  two things together
[2802.32 --> 2802.52]  right?
[2802.60 --> 2803.82]  See the parallel
[2803.82 --> 2804.20]  right?
[2804.64 --> 2805.28]  Sinners
[2805.28 --> 2806.50]  equals
[2806.50 --> 2807.34]  enemies.
[2807.34 --> 2807.52]  enemies.
[2808.52 --> 2809.44]  But it goes
[2809.44 --> 2810.12]  even further
[2810.12 --> 2811.40]  because for the
[2811.40 --> 2811.78]  elect
[2811.78 --> 2812.24]  for those
[2812.24 --> 2812.80]  who have
[2812.80 --> 2813.26]  been given
[2813.26 --> 2813.80]  the gift
[2813.80 --> 2814.42]  of faith
[2814.42 --> 2815.42]  and respond
[2815.42 --> 2815.98]  sinners
[2815.98 --> 2816.80]  equals
[2816.80 --> 2817.32]  enemies
[2817.32 --> 2818.20]  equals
[2818.20 --> 2819.04]  loved
[2819.04 --> 2819.54]  and
[2819.54 --> 2820.48]  chosen
[2820.48 --> 2821.32]  in Jesus
[2821.32 --> 2821.84]  Christ
[2821.84 --> 2822.38]  before the
[2822.38 --> 2822.80]  foundation
[2822.80 --> 2823.54]  of the world
[2823.54 --> 2824.30]  Paul writes
[2824.30 --> 2825.14]  in Ephesians 1.
[2826.18 --> 2827.18]  And so the line
[2827.18 --> 2827.58]  here
[2827.58 --> 2828.42]  the through line
[2828.42 --> 2828.72]  is that
[2828.72 --> 2829.66]  we love
[2829.66 --> 2830.40]  because He
[2830.40 --> 2831.22]  first loved
[2831.22 --> 2832.10]  us
[2832.10 --> 2834.06]  1 John 4
[2834.06 --> 2834.72]  19
[2834.72 --> 2836.58]  We love Him
[2836.58 --> 2837.58]  because He
[2837.58 --> 2838.24]  loves us
[2838.24 --> 2838.66]  and His
[2838.66 --> 2839.44]  love for us
[2839.44 --> 2840.58]  fills up
[2840.58 --> 2841.50]  to overflowing
[2841.50 --> 2842.48]  so that we
[2842.48 --> 2843.46]  will
[2843.46 --> 2845.18]  love others.
[2846.02 --> 2847.30]  And that's the thing
[2847.30 --> 2847.96]  to hear
[2847.96 --> 2848.66]  this morning
[2848.66 --> 2849.66]  if you truly
[2849.66 --> 2850.78]  know the one
[2850.78 --> 2851.58]  that is the love
[2851.58 --> 2852.22]  of God
[2852.22 --> 2853.26]  you will
[2853.26 --> 2854.04]  live
[2854.04 --> 2854.76]  and do
[2854.76 --> 2855.66]  the other.
[2856.46 --> 2857.10]  When God's
[2857.10 --> 2858.34]  love affects
[2858.34 --> 2858.78]  you
[2858.78 --> 2860.06]  your affections
[2860.06 --> 2860.88]  for Him
[2860.88 --> 2862.28]  are the consequence
[2862.28 --> 2864.00]  your affections
[2864.00 --> 2864.70]  for God
[2864.70 --> 2866.24]  will as a result
[2866.24 --> 2867.60]  manifest in
[2867.60 --> 2868.28]  loving your
[2868.28 --> 2868.70]  neighbor
[2868.70 --> 2869.24]  in loving
[2869.24 --> 2870.04]  the stranger
[2870.04 --> 2870.84]  or the alien
[2870.84 --> 2871.94]  or the enemy
[2871.94 --> 2873.24]  in your life.
[2876.68 --> 2877.28]  Now
[2877.28 --> 2879.84]  many of you
[2879.84 --> 2880.46]  have heard this
[2880.46 --> 2880.88]  before
[2880.88 --> 2882.60]  so I want to get
[2882.60 --> 2883.72]  real straightforward.
[2885.22 --> 2886.44]  If you say
[2886.44 --> 2887.44]  you love God
[2887.44 --> 2889.70]  and you go to
[2889.70 --> 2890.46]  church regularly
[2890.46 --> 2892.30]  say you didn't
[2892.30 --> 2892.84]  even miss
[2892.84 --> 2894.08]  one digital service
[2894.08 --> 2894.56]  when we were
[2894.56 --> 2895.20]  digital only
[2895.20 --> 2895.80]  through COVID
[2895.80 --> 2896.60]  that's how
[2896.60 --> 2897.24]  committed you
[2897.24 --> 2897.58]  are.
[2899.22 --> 2900.24]  If you say
[2900.24 --> 2901.16]  you love God
[2901.16 --> 2902.56]  but you don't
[2902.56 --> 2903.78]  stand up
[2903.78 --> 2904.82]  for the rights
[2904.82 --> 2905.80]  of the stranger
[2905.80 --> 2907.08]  or the alien
[2907.08 --> 2907.78]  you don't stand
[2907.78 --> 2908.76]  up for the justice
[2908.76 --> 2909.98]  of your neighbors
[2909.98 --> 2910.70]  you don't love
[2910.70 --> 2911.30]  the stranger
[2911.30 --> 2911.88]  and alien
[2911.88 --> 2912.50]  if you say
[2912.50 --> 2913.14]  you love God
[2913.14 --> 2913.66]  but you don't
[2913.66 --> 2914.40]  pray for the
[2914.40 --> 2915.80]  grace of your
[2915.80 --> 2916.16]  enemy
[2916.16 --> 2918.64]  really simply
[2918.64 --> 2920.36]  you don't
[2920.36 --> 2920.98]  love God
[2920.98 --> 2922.86]  or at least
[2922.86 --> 2923.36]  not the God
[2923.36 --> 2923.86]  of the Bible
[2923.86 --> 2925.60]  maybe a God
[2925.60 --> 2926.00]  of your own
[2926.00 --> 2926.40]  making
[2926.40 --> 2928.42]  right
[2928.42 --> 2929.52]  loving God
[2929.52 --> 2930.78]  means loving
[2930.78 --> 2931.74]  your neighbor
[2931.74 --> 2932.46]  whoever he
[2932.46 --> 2933.34]  she or they
[2933.34 --> 2934.28]  may be
[2934.28 --> 2936.24]  instead
[2936.24 --> 2938.70]  you might love
[2938.70 --> 2939.32]  your religion
[2939.32 --> 2942.00]  you might love
[2942.00 --> 2943.02]  your people
[2943.02 --> 2944.20]  whoever they are
[2944.20 --> 2945.10]  you might love
[2945.10 --> 2945.80]  your ideas
[2945.80 --> 2946.96]  and your laws
[2946.96 --> 2948.04]  and your structures
[2948.04 --> 2950.52]  but you aren't
[2950.52 --> 2951.32]  loving God
[2951.32 --> 2953.94]  now even now
[2953.94 --> 2954.48]  some of you
[2954.48 --> 2955.32]  are hearing this
[2955.32 --> 2955.56]  right
[2955.56 --> 2956.30]  and you're
[2956.30 --> 2956.88]  getting a little
[2956.88 --> 2957.46]  raised
[2957.46 --> 2958.44]  and maybe
[2958.44 --> 2959.32]  triggered is the
[2959.32 --> 2959.58]  word
[2959.58 --> 2960.02]  and you're
[2960.02 --> 2960.78]  already trying
[2960.78 --> 2961.78]  to justify
[2961.78 --> 2962.30]  yourself
[2962.30 --> 2962.56]  you're saying
[2962.56 --> 2962.92]  not me
[2962.92 --> 2963.60]  I don't do
[2963.60 --> 2963.78]  that
[2963.78 --> 2964.10]  I would
[2964.10 --> 2964.48]  never do
[2964.48 --> 2964.70]  that
[2964.70 --> 2965.30]  you do
[2965.30 --> 2967.98]  I do
[2967.98 --> 2970.52]  right
[2970.52 --> 2970.84]  and that's
[2970.84 --> 2971.36]  why we need
[2971.36 --> 2971.98]  parables
[2971.98 --> 2973.38]  to pierce
[2973.38 --> 2974.24]  the normal
[2974.24 --> 2974.96]  so that we
[2974.96 --> 2975.78]  can see
[2975.78 --> 2976.62]  with the eyes
[2976.62 --> 2977.16]  of God
[2977.16 --> 2979.00]  now I don't
[2979.00 --> 2979.46]  know what it
[2979.46 --> 2980.22]  is for you
[2980.22 --> 2981.10]  right
[2981.10 --> 2981.36]  maybe
[2981.36 --> 2982.12]  maybe it's
[2982.12 --> 2982.60]  a racist
[2982.60 --> 2983.24]  presumption
[2983.24 --> 2983.58]  that you
[2983.58 --> 2984.30]  have never
[2984.30 --> 2985.10]  questioned
[2985.10 --> 2987.80]  that's just
[2987.80 --> 2988.38]  who they are
[2988.38 --> 2988.86]  they can't
[2988.86 --> 2989.22]  change
[2989.22 --> 2990.54]  it's not
[2990.54 --> 2990.96]  really any
[2990.96 --> 2991.32]  fault of
[2991.32 --> 2991.62]  theirs
[2991.62 --> 2992.66]  that's a
[2992.66 --> 2993.10]  racist
[2993.10 --> 2993.80]  presumption
[2993.80 --> 2995.20]  let's name
[2995.20 --> 2995.54]  that
[2995.54 --> 2996.24]  boldly
[2996.24 --> 2997.68]  maybe
[2997.68 --> 2998.52]  you paint
[2998.52 --> 2999.24]  all left
[2999.24 --> 2999.92]  leaning people
[2999.92 --> 3000.30]  with the
[3000.30 --> 3000.82]  same brush
[3000.82 --> 3001.24]  maybe you
[3001.24 --> 3001.64]  paint all
[3001.64 --> 3002.32]  right leaning
[3002.32 --> 3002.68]  people
[3002.68 --> 3003.24]  with the
[3003.24 --> 3003.70]  same brush
[3003.70 --> 3004.30]  ultimately
[3004.30 --> 3005.00]  dismissing
[3005.00 --> 3005.50]  anyone who
[3005.50 --> 3005.72]  thinks
[3005.72 --> 3006.12]  differently
[3006.12 --> 3006.50]  than you
[3006.50 --> 3007.06]  on social
[3007.06 --> 3007.38]  issues
[3007.38 --> 3007.80]  or on the
[3007.80 --> 3008.14]  role of
[3008.14 --> 3008.52]  the government
[3008.52 --> 3009.32]  or economic
[3009.32 --> 3009.72]  policy
[3009.72 --> 3010.34]  or whatever
[3010.34 --> 3010.96]  it may be
[3010.96 --> 3011.52]  that sort
[3011.52 --> 3012.36]  of intellectual
[3012.36 --> 3013.20]  hubris
[3013.20 --> 3014.50]  isn't good
[3014.50 --> 3015.32]  for the
[3015.32 --> 3015.90]  community
[3015.90 --> 3017.68]  right I think
[3017.68 --> 3018.58]  that's in part
[3018.58 --> 3019.98]  why James
[3019.98 --> 3020.78]  tells us in
[3020.78 --> 3021.32]  chapter 1
[3021.32 --> 3022.00]  verse 19
[3022.00 --> 3022.62]  to be quick
[3022.62 --> 3023.78]  to listen
[3023.78 --> 3024.82]  and slow
[3024.82 --> 3025.44]  to speak
[3025.44 --> 3028.28]  and like I
[3028.28 --> 3029.38]  said I don't
[3029.38 --> 3030.30]  know what it
[3030.30 --> 3031.04]  is for you
[3031.04 --> 3031.84]  but maybe
[3031.84 --> 3032.36]  there's a
[3032.36 --> 3033.60]  boiling anger
[3033.60 --> 3034.42]  that's always
[3034.42 --> 3034.90]  in you
[3034.90 --> 3035.52]  just barely
[3035.52 --> 3036.16]  below the
[3036.16 --> 3036.48]  surface
[3036.48 --> 3036.78]  and the
[3036.78 --> 3036.98]  people
[3036.98 --> 3037.58]  around you
[3037.58 --> 3038.22]  they can't
[3038.22 --> 3038.50]  quite put
[3038.50 --> 3038.92]  a finger
[3038.92 --> 3039.28]  on it
[3039.28 --> 3039.72]  but they
[3039.72 --> 3040.68]  feel it
[3040.68 --> 3041.90]  right there's
[3041.90 --> 3042.54]  no margin
[3042.54 --> 3043.12]  in you
[3043.12 --> 3043.74]  for for
[3043.74 --> 3044.44]  grace or
[3044.44 --> 3044.90]  love
[3044.90 --> 3046.66]  like I
[3046.66 --> 3047.02]  don't know
[3047.02 --> 3047.22]  what it
[3047.22 --> 3047.68]  is for you
[3047.68 --> 3048.10]  and whatever
[3048.10 --> 3048.58]  it is for
[3048.58 --> 3049.00]  you that's
[3049.00 --> 3049.70]  your job
[3049.70 --> 3051.02]  to introspect
[3051.02 --> 3051.68]  on
[3051.68 --> 3053.76]  if you
[3053.76 --> 3054.84]  know
[3054.84 --> 3056.30]  God's
[3056.30 --> 3056.86]  love
[3056.86 --> 3057.34]  if you
[3057.34 --> 3058.34]  love
[3058.34 --> 3059.32]  God
[3059.32 --> 3059.78]  you need
[3059.78 --> 3060.66]  to show
[3060.66 --> 3061.56]  that
[3061.56 --> 3062.64]  love
[3062.64 --> 3064.28]  now
[3064.28 --> 3066.02]  don't hear
[3066.02 --> 3066.30]  what I'm
[3066.30 --> 3066.88]  not saying
[3066.88 --> 3068.18]  right
[3068.18 --> 3068.84]  loving
[3068.84 --> 3069.58]  someone
[3069.58 --> 3070.48]  proper
[3070.48 --> 3071.24]  loving
[3071.24 --> 3071.62]  someone
[3071.62 --> 3071.82]  as
[3071.82 --> 3072.62]  God
[3072.62 --> 3073.14]  loves
[3073.14 --> 3073.32]  them
[3073.32 --> 3073.92]  means
[3073.92 --> 3074.36]  loving
[3074.36 --> 3074.64]  them
[3074.64 --> 3074.92]  where
[3074.92 --> 3075.16]  they
[3075.16 --> 3075.34]  are
[3075.34 --> 3075.74]  at
[3075.74 --> 3076.52]  but
[3076.52 --> 3077.22]  loving
[3077.22 --> 3077.48]  them
[3077.48 --> 3077.92]  enough
[3077.92 --> 3078.34]  to not
[3078.34 --> 3078.60]  leave
[3078.60 --> 3078.80]  them
[3078.80 --> 3079.12]  there
[3079.12 --> 3081.00]  the love
[3081.00 --> 3081.50]  of God
[3081.50 --> 3082.12]  transforms
[3082.12 --> 3082.74]  us
[3082.74 --> 3083.18]  into
[3083.18 --> 3083.96]  the image
[3083.96 --> 3084.86]  of God
[3084.86 --> 3086.16]  and the
[3086.16 --> 3086.50]  love
[3086.50 --> 3087.02]  of Jesus
[3087.02 --> 3087.72]  disciples
[3087.72 --> 3088.32]  the love
[3088.32 --> 3088.76]  that people
[3088.76 --> 3089.58]  experience
[3089.58 --> 3090.10]  from you
[3090.10 --> 3090.64]  and me
[3090.64 --> 3091.06]  as his
[3091.06 --> 3091.48]  disciples
[3091.48 --> 3092.16]  ought to
[3092.16 --> 3092.52]  do the
[3092.52 --> 3092.84]  same
[3092.84 --> 3095.06]  let me be
[3095.06 --> 3095.78]  really clear
[3095.78 --> 3096.20]  again
[3096.20 --> 3098.10]  unconditional
[3098.10 --> 3098.96]  love
[3098.96 --> 3100.84]  must still
[3100.84 --> 3101.22]  have
[3101.22 --> 3102.28]  expectations
[3102.28 --> 3105.72]  the love
[3105.72 --> 3106.64]  of God
[3106.64 --> 3107.62]  is made
[3107.62 --> 3108.24]  evident
[3108.24 --> 3109.26]  in you
[3109.26 --> 3109.86]  by your
[3109.86 --> 3110.54]  obedience
[3110.54 --> 3111.50]  to him
[3111.50 --> 3113.42]  love
[3113.42 --> 3113.86]  is
[3113.86 --> 3114.48]  obedience
[3114.48 --> 3115.10]  to God
[3115.10 --> 3115.70]  even
[3115.70 --> 3116.02]  if
[3116.02 --> 3116.26]  our
[3116.26 --> 3116.64]  cultural
[3116.64 --> 3117.10]  moment
[3117.10 --> 3117.34]  has
[3117.34 --> 3117.62]  another
[3117.62 --> 3117.94]  anthem
[3117.94 --> 3118.14]  or
[3118.14 --> 3118.36]  another
[3118.36 --> 3118.90]  idea
[3118.90 --> 3119.34]  about
[3119.34 --> 3119.52]  what
[3119.52 --> 3119.76]  love
[3119.76 --> 3120.00]  might
[3120.00 --> 3120.32]  be
[3120.32 --> 3122.00]  Jesus
[3122.00 --> 3122.58]  says
[3122.58 --> 3122.90]  in
[3122.90 --> 3123.26]  John
[3123.26 --> 3123.90]  14
[3123.90 --> 3124.84]  if
[3124.84 --> 3125.00]  you
[3125.00 --> 3125.32]  love
[3125.32 --> 3125.68]  me
[3125.68 --> 3126.18]  you
[3126.18 --> 3126.40]  will
[3126.40 --> 3126.82]  keep
[3126.82 --> 3127.90]  my
[3127.90 --> 3128.36]  commandments
[3128.36 --> 3130.50]  and so
[3130.50 --> 3130.64]  let's
[3130.64 --> 3130.92]  come back
[3130.92 --> 3131.24]  to that
[3131.24 --> 3131.80]  that
[3131.80 --> 3132.38]  biblical
[3132.38 --> 3132.90]  theology
[3132.90 --> 3133.40]  through line
[3133.40 --> 3133.58]  right
[3133.58 --> 3134.00]  sinners
[3134.00 --> 3134.50]  equals
[3134.50 --> 3134.92]  enemies
[3134.92 --> 3135.46]  equals
[3135.46 --> 3136.38]  loved
[3136.38 --> 3137.22]  by God
[3137.22 --> 3137.66]  before the
[3137.66 --> 3137.98]  foundation
[3137.98 --> 3138.24]  of the
[3138.24 --> 3138.44]  world
[3138.44 --> 3139.30]  equals
[3139.30 --> 3140.20]  obedient
[3140.20 --> 3141.94]  in
[3141.94 --> 3142.60]  response
[3142.60 --> 3143.22]  and
[3143.22 --> 3143.70]  gratitude
[3143.70 --> 3144.70]  to what
[3144.70 --> 3144.96]  he has
[3144.96 --> 3145.28]  done
[3145.28 --> 3146.18]  and who
[3146.18 --> 3146.62]  he is
[3146.62 --> 3148.32]  but this
[3148.32 --> 3148.66]  is the
[3148.66 --> 3149.20]  danger
[3149.20 --> 3150.60]  right
[3150.60 --> 3151.82]  expectations
[3151.82 --> 3152.64]  without
[3152.64 --> 3153.42]  love
[3153.42 --> 3154.84]  is an
[3154.84 --> 3155.14]  abuse
[3155.14 --> 3155.32]  of
[3155.32 --> 3155.76]  power
[3155.76 --> 3157.66]  obedience
[3157.66 --> 3158.50]  without
[3158.50 --> 3159.20]  love
[3159.20 --> 3160.44]  is
[3160.44 --> 3161.04]  tyranny
[3161.04 --> 3163.42]  and that
[3163.42 --> 3163.90]  matters
[3163.90 --> 3164.72]  for us
[3164.72 --> 3165.04]  because
[3165.04 --> 3165.90]  because as
[3165.90 --> 3166.30]  we read
[3166.30 --> 3166.88]  this parable
[3166.88 --> 3167.58]  who is
[3167.58 --> 3167.82]  it
[3167.82 --> 3168.80]  that ignores
[3168.80 --> 3169.44]  the broken
[3169.44 --> 3169.94]  and the
[3169.94 --> 3170.16]  beaten
[3170.16 --> 3170.78]  man on
[3170.78 --> 3171.32]  the Jericho
[3171.32 --> 3171.66]  road
[3171.66 --> 3173.60]  it's a
[3173.60 --> 3173.96]  priest
[3173.96 --> 3174.94]  and a
[3174.94 --> 3175.40]  Levite
[3175.40 --> 3175.90]  it's the
[3175.90 --> 3176.72]  religious
[3176.72 --> 3177.54]  class
[3177.54 --> 3178.18]  of
[3178.18 --> 3178.60]  second
[3178.60 --> 3179.02]  temple
[3179.02 --> 3179.70]  Judaism
[3179.70 --> 3180.20]  it's the
[3180.20 --> 3180.58]  religious
[3180.58 --> 3181.24]  elite
[3181.24 --> 3181.80]  that
[3181.80 --> 3182.24]  one
[3182.24 --> 3182.70]  writer
[3182.70 --> 3183.68]  said
[3183.68 --> 3184.28]  the priest
[3184.28 --> 3185.18]  decided
[3185.18 --> 3185.60]  that his
[3185.60 --> 3186.26]  ceremonial
[3186.26 --> 3186.72]  purity
[3186.72 --> 3187.30]  was too
[3187.30 --> 3187.76]  important
[3187.76 --> 3188.46]  to risk
[3188.46 --> 3189.92]  right
[3189.92 --> 3190.32]  and then the
[3190.32 --> 3190.70]  Levite
[3190.70 --> 3191.36]  uses the
[3191.36 --> 3191.96]  same
[3191.96 --> 3193.04]  idea
[3193.04 --> 3193.42]  for
[3193.42 --> 3193.90]  passing
[3193.90 --> 3194.64]  on the
[3194.64 --> 3194.90]  other
[3194.90 --> 3195.40]  side
[3195.40 --> 3196.14]  of the
[3196.14 --> 3196.38]  road
[3196.38 --> 3200.10]  so real
[3200.10 --> 3200.34]  quick
[3200.34 --> 3200.62]  I was
[3200.62 --> 3200.94]  unable
[3200.94 --> 3201.58]  to find
[3201.58 --> 3202.12]  a
[3202.12 --> 3202.58]  picture
[3202.58 --> 3203.66]  a
[3203.66 --> 3203.84]  number
[3203.84 --> 3203.98]  of
[3203.98 --> 3204.16]  years
[3204.16 --> 3204.40]  ago
[3204.40 --> 3204.62]  I
[3204.62 --> 3205.14]  had
[3205.14 --> 3205.24]  the
[3205.24 --> 3205.60]  opportunity
[3205.60 --> 3206.20]  to
[3206.20 --> 3206.58]  travel
[3206.58 --> 3207.08]  throughout
[3207.08 --> 3207.80]  Israel
[3207.80 --> 3208.28]  and we
[3208.28 --> 3208.80]  walked
[3208.80 --> 3209.80]  on this
[3209.80 --> 3210.74]  Jericho
[3210.74 --> 3211.14]  road
[3211.14 --> 3211.94]  we started
[3211.94 --> 3212.54]  in Jericho
[3212.54 --> 3212.92]  and we
[3212.92 --> 3213.40]  walked up
[3213.40 --> 3213.88]  towards
[3213.88 --> 3214.62]  Jerusalem
[3214.62 --> 3215.02]  it's a
[3215.02 --> 3215.72]  17 mile
[3215.72 --> 3216.22]  hike
[3216.22 --> 3216.52]  so we
[3216.52 --> 3216.66]  didn't
[3216.66 --> 3216.90]  do the
[3216.90 --> 3217.06]  whole
[3217.06 --> 3217.34]  thing
[3217.34 --> 3217.68]  but we
[3217.68 --> 3217.96]  walked
[3217.96 --> 3218.26]  through
[3218.26 --> 3218.76]  the
[3218.76 --> 3219.40]  treacherous
[3219.40 --> 3219.74]  part
[3219.74 --> 3219.92]  the
[3219.92 --> 3220.24]  part
[3220.24 --> 3220.50]  where
[3220.50 --> 3221.60]  Jesus
[3221.60 --> 3222.12]  probably
[3222.12 --> 3222.56]  has in
[3222.56 --> 3222.88]  mind
[3222.88 --> 3223.22]  when he
[3223.22 --> 3223.50]  tells
[3223.50 --> 3223.80]  this
[3223.80 --> 3224.26]  story
[3224.26 --> 3225.00]  and it's
[3225.00 --> 3225.40]  on a
[3225.40 --> 3226.10]  cliff
[3226.10 --> 3226.50]  face
[3226.50 --> 3226.84]  and there's
[3226.84 --> 3227.16]  a narrow
[3227.16 --> 3227.54]  path
[3227.54 --> 3227.86]  and there's
[3227.86 --> 3228.30]  countless
[3228.30 --> 3229.54]  switchbacks
[3229.54 --> 3230.16]  and turns
[3230.16 --> 3230.70]  and places
[3230.70 --> 3231.22]  for people
[3231.22 --> 3231.70]  to hide
[3231.70 --> 3232.28]  like the
[3232.28 --> 3232.60]  Jericho
[3232.60 --> 3232.92]  road
[3232.92 --> 3233.50]  was known
[3233.50 --> 3233.86]  as the
[3233.86 --> 3234.14]  place
[3234.14 --> 3234.34]  where
[3234.34 --> 3234.70]  robbers
[3234.70 --> 3234.86]  would
[3234.86 --> 3235.14]  come
[3235.14 --> 3235.56]  and
[3235.56 --> 3235.72]  would
[3235.72 --> 3235.98]  beat
[3235.98 --> 3236.26]  you
[3236.26 --> 3238.92]  now
[3238.92 --> 3239.40]  the
[3239.40 --> 3239.74]  Jericho
[3239.74 --> 3240.10]  road
[3240.10 --> 3240.70]  like most
[3240.70 --> 3241.34]  paths
[3241.34 --> 3241.88]  during
[3241.88 --> 3242.24]  this
[3242.24 --> 3242.64]  ancient
[3242.64 --> 3243.16]  time
[3243.16 --> 3243.64]  follows
[3243.64 --> 3244.88]  between
[3244.88 --> 3245.44]  two
[3245.44 --> 3246.72]  mountain
[3246.72 --> 3247.10]  cliff
[3247.10 --> 3247.54]  faces
[3247.54 --> 3248.62]  and along
[3248.62 --> 3249.08]  the bottom
[3249.08 --> 3249.36]  and up
[3249.36 --> 3249.58]  on the
[3249.58 --> 3249.84]  edge
[3249.84 --> 3251.00]  and there's
[3251.00 --> 3251.38]  a path
[3251.38 --> 3252.42]  on the
[3252.42 --> 3253.76]  eastern
[3253.76 --> 3254.24]  slope
[3254.26 --> 3254.66]  and a
[3254.66 --> 3254.98]  path
[3254.98 --> 3255.32]  on the
[3255.32 --> 3255.74]  western
[3255.74 --> 3256.30]  slope
[3256.30 --> 3257.50]  and so
[3257.50 --> 3257.92]  when it
[3257.92 --> 3258.36]  says
[3258.36 --> 3258.74]  that the
[3258.74 --> 3260.08]  Levite
[3260.08 --> 3260.38]  and the
[3260.38 --> 3260.62]  priest
[3260.62 --> 3261.10]  crossed
[3261.10 --> 3261.54]  to the
[3261.54 --> 3261.74]  other
[3261.74 --> 3262.14]  side
[3262.14 --> 3262.64]  they
[3262.64 --> 3263.04]  literally
[3263.04 --> 3263.60]  would have
[3263.60 --> 3263.86]  had to
[3263.86 --> 3264.16]  climb
[3264.16 --> 3264.38]  down
[3264.38 --> 3264.52]  a
[3264.52 --> 3264.74]  mountain
[3264.74 --> 3265.02]  and
[3265.02 --> 3265.28]  climb
[3265.28 --> 3265.46]  up
[3265.46 --> 3265.70]  another
[3265.70 --> 3265.94]  one
[3265.94 --> 3266.28]  to get
[3266.28 --> 3266.62]  onto
[3266.62 --> 3266.82]  the
[3266.82 --> 3267.14]  path
[3267.14 --> 3267.36]  that's
[3267.36 --> 3267.60]  on the
[3267.60 --> 3267.76]  other
[3267.76 --> 3268.06]  side
[3268.06 --> 3269.20]  that's
[3269.20 --> 3269.48]  how
[3269.48 --> 3269.88]  much
[3269.88 --> 3270.08]  they
[3270.08 --> 3270.44]  didn't
[3270.44 --> 3270.70]  want
[3270.70 --> 3271.02]  to
[3271.02 --> 3272.04]  upset
[3272.04 --> 3272.40]  the
[3272.40 --> 3273.32]  religious
[3273.32 --> 3274.92]  requirements
[3274.92 --> 3275.46]  that they
[3275.46 --> 3276.16]  had imposed
[3276.16 --> 3276.88]  and felt
[3276.88 --> 3277.36]  imposed
[3277.36 --> 3278.02]  on
[3278.02 --> 3278.48]  themselves
[3278.48 --> 3281.80]  what
[3281.80 --> 3282.06]  Jesus
[3282.06 --> 3282.32]  is
[3282.32 --> 3282.62]  saying
[3282.62 --> 3284.20]  is that
[3284.20 --> 3284.34]  when
[3284.34 --> 3285.66]  our
[3285.66 --> 3286.32]  ideas
[3286.32 --> 3286.76]  of
[3286.76 --> 3287.36]  purity
[3287.36 --> 3288.44]  are
[3288.44 --> 3288.76]  more
[3288.76 --> 3289.30]  important
[3289.30 --> 3289.58]  than
[3289.58 --> 3290.04]  charity
[3290.04 --> 3291.52]  we've
[3291.52 --> 3291.70]  missed
[3291.70 --> 3291.84]  the
[3291.84 --> 3292.06]  mark
[3292.06 --> 3292.18]  of
[3292.18 --> 3292.30]  the
[3292.30 --> 3292.64]  gospel
[3292.64 --> 3294.16]  when
[3294.16 --> 3294.30]  the
[3294.30 --> 3294.80]  opinions
[3294.80 --> 3295.24]  of
[3295.24 --> 3295.44]  the
[3295.44 --> 3295.80]  people
[3295.80 --> 3296.28]  we
[3296.28 --> 3296.64]  know
[3296.64 --> 3296.96]  are
[3296.96 --> 3297.22]  more
[3297.22 --> 3297.68]  important
[3297.68 --> 3297.92]  than
[3297.92 --> 3298.12]  the
[3298.12 --> 3298.56]  lives
[3298.56 --> 3298.82]  of
[3298.82 --> 3298.98]  the
[3298.98 --> 3299.26]  people
[3299.26 --> 3299.48]  we
[3299.48 --> 3299.72]  might
[3299.72 --> 3299.92]  not
[3299.92 --> 3300.20]  yet
[3300.20 --> 3300.54]  know
[3300.54 --> 3301.56]  we've
[3301.56 --> 3301.76]  missed
[3301.76 --> 3301.98]  the
[3301.98 --> 3302.18]  mark
[3302.18 --> 3302.30]  of
[3302.30 --> 3302.42]  the
[3302.42 --> 3302.86]  gospel
[3302.86 --> 3304.66]  the
[3304.66 --> 3305.68]  affections
[3305.68 --> 3305.98]  you
[3305.98 --> 3306.42]  have
[3306.42 --> 3306.94]  for
[3306.94 --> 3307.36]  Jesus
[3307.36 --> 3307.74]  are
[3307.74 --> 3308.00]  made
[3308.00 --> 3308.56]  real
[3308.56 --> 3308.88]  when
[3308.88 --> 3309.04]  they
[3309.04 --> 3309.24]  are
[3309.24 --> 3309.96]  effective
[3309.96 --> 3311.02]  in
[3311.02 --> 3311.16]  the
[3311.16 --> 3311.36]  way
[3311.36 --> 3311.62]  you
[3311.62 --> 3311.94]  live
[3311.94 --> 3312.16]  your
[3312.16 --> 3312.66]  life
[3312.66 --> 3314.62]  if
[3314.62 --> 3315.02]  not
[3315.02 --> 3316.32]  we've
[3316.32 --> 3316.74]  just
[3316.74 --> 3317.28]  become
[3317.28 --> 3317.58]  the
[3317.58 --> 3317.94]  self
[3317.94 --> 3318.68]  justifying
[3318.68 --> 3319.40]  religious
[3319.40 --> 3319.86]  expert
[3319.86 --> 3320.08]  who
[3320.08 --> 3320.32]  misses
[3320.32 --> 3320.60]  the
[3320.60 --> 3320.92]  heart
[3320.92 --> 3321.56]  of
[3321.56 --> 3321.68]  the
[3321.68 --> 3322.08]  gospel
[3322.08 --> 3325.76]  now
[3325.76 --> 3328.70]  I
[3328.70 --> 3329.08]  think
[3329.08 --> 3329.48]  that
[3329.48 --> 3330.62]  the
[3330.62 --> 3331.30]  genius
[3331.30 --> 3331.74]  of
[3331.74 --> 3332.00]  this
[3332.00 --> 3332.46]  parable
[3332.46 --> 3333.02]  comes
[3333.02 --> 3334.04]  in
[3334.04 --> 3334.24]  the
[3334.24 --> 3334.84]  inversion
[3334.84 --> 3335.52]  not
[3335.52 --> 3335.70]  in
[3335.70 --> 3335.82]  the
[3335.82 --> 3336.18]  inversion
[3336.18 --> 3336.54]  just
[3336.54 --> 3336.74]  of
[3336.74 --> 3336.92]  the
[3336.92 --> 3337.64]  expectations
[3337.64 --> 3338.10]  where
[3338.10 --> 3338.26]  the
[3338.26 --> 3338.96]  hero
[3338.96 --> 3339.30]  of
[3339.30 --> 3339.52]  this
[3339.52 --> 3339.92]  story
[3339.92 --> 3340.18]  is
[3340.18 --> 3340.34]  a
[3340.34 --> 3340.64]  hated
[3340.64 --> 3341.68]  Samaritan
[3341.68 --> 3342.64]  you
[3342.64 --> 3342.82]  don't
[3342.82 --> 3343.00]  know
[3343.00 --> 3343.24]  the
[3343.24 --> 3343.62]  story
[3343.62 --> 3344.56]  centuries
[3344.56 --> 3345.18]  before
[3345.18 --> 3346.12]  Jesus
[3346.12 --> 3346.88]  most
[3346.88 --> 3347.10]  of
[3347.10 --> 3347.24]  the
[3347.24 --> 3347.68]  Jews
[3347.68 --> 3348.00]  were
[3348.00 --> 3348.94]  exiled
[3348.94 --> 3349.16]  and
[3349.16 --> 3349.52]  carried
[3349.52 --> 3349.78]  into
[3349.78 --> 3350.24]  captivity
[3350.24 --> 3350.88]  in
[3350.88 --> 3351.38]  Babylon
[3351.38 --> 3351.68]  they
[3351.68 --> 3351.82]  were
[3351.82 --> 3352.14]  carried
[3352.14 --> 3352.40]  away
[3352.40 --> 3352.60]  by
[3352.60 --> 3352.78]  a
[3352.78 --> 3353.06]  foreign
[3353.06 --> 3353.76]  army
[3353.76 --> 3354.80]  this
[3354.80 --> 3354.92]  is
[3354.92 --> 3355.06]  the
[3355.06 --> 3355.32]  story
[3355.32 --> 3355.52]  of
[3355.52 --> 3355.86]  Daniel
[3355.86 --> 3356.08]  and
[3356.08 --> 3356.42]  Jeremiah
[3356.42 --> 3356.78]  and
[3356.78 --> 3357.38]  Ezekiel
[3357.38 --> 3357.84]  and
[3357.84 --> 3358.08]  some
[3358.08 --> 3358.24]  of
[3358.24 --> 3358.38]  the
[3358.38 --> 3358.68]  Jewish
[3358.68 --> 3359.04]  people
[3359.04 --> 3359.20]  who
[3359.20 --> 3359.30]  were
[3359.30 --> 3359.50]  left
[3359.50 --> 3359.86]  behind
[3359.86 --> 3360.06]  in
[3360.06 --> 3360.26]  the
[3360.26 --> 3360.98]  region
[3360.98 --> 3362.14]  especially
[3362.14 --> 3362.58]  the
[3362.58 --> 3363.80]  northwestern
[3363.80 --> 3364.06]  part
[3364.06 --> 3364.38]  away
[3364.38 --> 3364.68]  from
[3364.68 --> 3365.28]  Jerusalem
[3365.28 --> 3366.42]  they
[3366.42 --> 3367.02]  left
[3367.02 --> 3367.48]  behind
[3367.48 --> 3367.80]  they
[3367.80 --> 3368.86]  intermarried
[3368.86 --> 3369.46]  and started
[3369.46 --> 3369.94]  mixing
[3369.94 --> 3370.86]  with the
[3370.86 --> 3371.92]  indigenous
[3371.92 --> 3372.76]  population
[3372.76 --> 3373.14]  who were
[3373.14 --> 3373.28]  there
[3373.28 --> 3373.60]  before
[3373.60 --> 3373.78]  them
[3373.78 --> 3373.96]  the
[3373.96 --> 3374.50]  Canaanite
[3374.50 --> 3375.06]  people
[3375.06 --> 3376.04]  and
[3376.04 --> 3376.20]  what
[3376.20 --> 3376.36]  they
[3376.36 --> 3376.72]  did
[3376.72 --> 3377.24]  essentially
[3377.24 --> 3377.58]  was
[3377.58 --> 3378.02]  form
[3378.02 --> 3378.76]  a new
[3378.76 --> 3379.36]  tribe
[3379.36 --> 3379.70]  and
[3379.70 --> 3379.94]  with
[3379.94 --> 3380.14]  that
[3380.14 --> 3380.54]  a new
[3380.54 --> 3381.24]  religion
[3381.24 --> 3381.54]  so
[3381.54 --> 3381.68]  they
[3381.68 --> 3381.86]  took
[3381.86 --> 3382.22]  parts
[3382.22 --> 3382.40]  of
[3382.40 --> 3382.54]  their
[3382.54 --> 3382.96]  Jewish
[3382.96 --> 3383.46]  religious
[3383.46 --> 3384.14]  history
[3384.14 --> 3384.82]  and
[3384.82 --> 3384.98]  they
[3384.98 --> 3385.28]  took
[3385.28 --> 3386.18]  parts
[3386.18 --> 3386.40]  of
[3386.40 --> 3386.58]  the
[3386.58 --> 3387.12]  Canaanite
[3387.12 --> 3387.58]  religion
[3387.58 --> 3388.26]  that was
[3388.26 --> 3388.72]  in there
[3388.72 --> 3388.90]  so
[3388.90 --> 3389.66]  the
[3389.66 --> 3390.34]  Samaritans
[3390.34 --> 3390.62]  took
[3390.62 --> 3391.02]  the
[3391.02 --> 3391.84]  Pentateuch
[3391.84 --> 3392.32]  the first
[3392.32 --> 3392.98]  five books
[3392.98 --> 3393.32]  of the
[3393.32 --> 3393.62]  Bible
[3393.62 --> 3394.60]  but they
[3394.60 --> 3395.16]  didn't
[3395.16 --> 3395.96]  carry and
[3395.96 --> 3396.44]  believe in
[3396.44 --> 3396.94]  the Psalms
[3396.94 --> 3397.20]  or the
[3397.20 --> 3397.54]  prophets
[3397.54 --> 3398.92]  they took
[3398.92 --> 3399.40]  those
[3399.40 --> 3399.74]  and they
[3399.74 --> 3400.68]  mixed it
[3400.68 --> 3401.04]  with
[3401.04 --> 3401.64]  Canaanite
[3401.64 --> 3402.06]  religion
[3402.06 --> 3402.36]  to
[3402.36 --> 3402.84]  Baal
[3402.84 --> 3403.20]  and
[3403.20 --> 3403.78]  Asherah
[3403.78 --> 3404.10]  and the
[3404.10 --> 3404.34]  like
[3404.34 --> 3404.96]  and mess
[3404.96 --> 3405.18]  them
[3405.18 --> 3405.60]  together
[3405.60 --> 3406.40]  and so
[3406.40 --> 3407.50]  Jews
[3407.50 --> 3408.12]  who eventually
[3408.12 --> 3408.78]  came back
[3408.78 --> 3409.40]  from exile
[3409.40 --> 3409.88]  and settled
[3409.88 --> 3410.48]  back in
[3410.48 --> 3411.16]  the land
[3411.16 --> 3411.82]  considered
[3411.82 --> 3412.22]  these
[3412.22 --> 3413.32]  Samaritans
[3413.32 --> 3414.42]  racially
[3414.42 --> 3415.34]  inferior
[3415.34 --> 3416.92]  because they
[3416.92 --> 3417.80]  had intermarried
[3417.80 --> 3418.20]  and they
[3418.20 --> 3418.70]  called them
[3418.70 --> 3419.54]  heretics
[3419.54 --> 3420.52]  because they
[3420.52 --> 3421.14]  had changed
[3421.14 --> 3421.88]  and compromised
[3421.88 --> 3423.30]  their religion
[3423.30 --> 3425.80]  and so
[3425.80 --> 3426.32]  that the
[3426.32 --> 3427.16]  hero of
[3427.16 --> 3427.98]  this story
[3427.98 --> 3428.70]  is a
[3428.70 --> 3429.32]  Samaritan
[3429.32 --> 3430.82]  is obviously
[3430.82 --> 3431.60]  an inversion
[3431.60 --> 3432.50]  of expectations
[3432.50 --> 3434.48]  I tried to
[3434.48 --> 3435.14]  convey it a little
[3435.14 --> 3435.86]  bit as we
[3435.86 --> 3436.32]  read it
[3436.32 --> 3437.24]  but in verse
[3437.24 --> 3438.24]  33 when Jesus
[3438.24 --> 3438.98]  is telling the
[3438.98 --> 3439.44]  story
[3439.44 --> 3440.86]  says but a
[3440.86 --> 3441.68]  Samaritan
[3441.68 --> 3443.02]  it's likely
[3443.02 --> 3443.96]  that you
[3443.96 --> 3444.38]  can imagine
[3444.38 --> 3444.76]  the crowd
[3444.76 --> 3445.34]  jeering
[3445.34 --> 3446.18]  when they
[3446.18 --> 3446.70]  hear that
[3446.70 --> 3449.32]  but
[3449.32 --> 3451.02]  there's
[3451.02 --> 3451.64]  also
[3451.64 --> 3453.22]  dare I
[3453.22 --> 3453.34]  say
[3453.34 --> 3454.40]  more profound
[3454.40 --> 3455.50]  inversion
[3455.50 --> 3456.08]  that takes
[3456.08 --> 3456.52]  place
[3456.52 --> 3456.88]  in the
[3456.88 --> 3457.04]  very
[3457.04 --> 3457.76]  question
[3457.76 --> 3458.76]  that Jesus
[3458.76 --> 3459.32]  asks
[3459.32 --> 3460.00]  and this
[3460.00 --> 3460.28]  is our
[3460.28 --> 3460.70]  second
[3460.70 --> 3461.46]  question
[3461.46 --> 3461.86]  now
[3461.86 --> 3463.16]  so remember
[3463.16 --> 3463.60]  the expert
[3463.60 --> 3464.12]  in the law
[3464.12 --> 3465.28]  asked Jesus
[3465.28 --> 3466.00]  who is
[3466.00 --> 3466.96]  my neighbor
[3466.96 --> 3467.68]  as he tried
[3467.68 --> 3468.36]  to justify
[3468.36 --> 3468.92]  himself
[3468.92 --> 3469.30]  and so
[3469.30 --> 3469.64]  Jesus
[3469.64 --> 3470.14]  tells
[3470.14 --> 3470.56]  this
[3470.56 --> 3471.52]  parable
[3471.52 --> 3472.26]  and then
[3472.26 --> 3472.60]  Jesus
[3472.60 --> 3473.10]  ends
[3473.10 --> 3473.94]  by asking
[3473.94 --> 3474.56]  which
[3474.56 --> 3475.16]  of these
[3475.16 --> 3475.62]  three
[3475.62 --> 3476.18]  do you
[3476.18 --> 3476.56]  think
[3476.56 --> 3477.12]  was a
[3477.12 --> 3477.52]  neighbor
[3477.52 --> 3478.26]  to the
[3478.26 --> 3478.54]  man
[3478.54 --> 3478.76]  who
[3478.76 --> 3479.36]  fell
[3479.36 --> 3479.60]  into
[3479.60 --> 3479.78]  the
[3479.78 --> 3480.00]  hands
[3480.00 --> 3480.22]  of the
[3480.22 --> 3480.52]  robber
[3480.52 --> 3481.76]  you get
[3481.76 --> 3482.42]  the difference
[3482.42 --> 3482.66]  there
[3482.66 --> 3482.86]  right
[3482.86 --> 3483.24]  the man
[3483.24 --> 3483.68]  asks
[3483.68 --> 3484.12]  the expert
[3484.12 --> 3484.44]  in the law
[3484.44 --> 3484.82]  says who
[3484.82 --> 3485.28]  is my
[3485.28 --> 3485.62]  neighbor
[3485.62 --> 3486.50]  and Jesus
[3486.50 --> 3487.46]  asks which
[3487.46 --> 3488.00]  of these
[3488.00 --> 3488.32]  ones
[3488.32 --> 3488.84]  acted
[3488.84 --> 3489.56]  neighborly
[3489.56 --> 3491.14]  right
[3491.14 --> 3491.72]  the man
[3491.72 --> 3492.26]  the expert
[3492.26 --> 3492.70]  wanted to
[3492.70 --> 3493.36]  put a
[3493.36 --> 3493.68]  quote
[3493.68 --> 3494.66]  justifiable
[3494.66 --> 3495.32]  limits
[3495.32 --> 3495.86]  on his
[3495.86 --> 3496.38]  charity
[3496.38 --> 3497.32]  Jesus
[3497.32 --> 3498.10]  makes you
[3498.10 --> 3498.66]  ask how
[3498.66 --> 3498.90]  do I
[3498.90 --> 3499.12]  become
[3499.12 --> 3499.28]  a
[3499.28 --> 3499.50]  neighbor
[3499.50 --> 3502.40]  there's
[3502.40 --> 3503.90]  a
[3503.90 --> 3505.30]  Cuban
[3505.30 --> 3505.76]  born
[3505.76 --> 3506.28]  American
[3506.28 --> 3507.00]  historian
[3507.00 --> 3507.30]  by the
[3507.30 --> 3507.44]  name
[3507.44 --> 3507.64]  of
[3507.64 --> 3508.06]  Justo
[3508.06 --> 3508.60]  Gonzalez
[3508.60 --> 3509.26]  and
[3509.26 --> 3509.88]  theologian
[3509.88 --> 3510.98]  and he
[3510.98 --> 3511.30]  puts it
[3511.30 --> 3511.58]  it's a bit
[3511.58 --> 3511.92]  of a long
[3511.92 --> 3512.42]  quote so it'll
[3512.42 --> 3512.80]  be on the
[3512.80 --> 3513.28]  screen there
[3513.28 --> 3515.60]  he says
[3515.60 --> 3516.48]  Jesus
[3516.48 --> 3517.06]  final
[3517.06 --> 3517.62]  injunction
[3517.62 --> 3518.08]  to the
[3518.08 --> 3518.40]  lawyer
[3518.40 --> 3519.08]  go and
[3519.08 --> 3519.24]  do
[3519.24 --> 3519.74]  likewise
[3519.74 --> 3520.76]  does not
[3520.76 --> 3521.20]  simply
[3521.20 --> 3522.04]  mean go
[3522.04 --> 3522.84]  and act
[3522.84 --> 3523.46]  in love
[3523.46 --> 3523.84]  to your
[3523.84 --> 3524.18]  neighbor
[3524.18 --> 3525.26]  but rather
[3525.26 --> 3526.12]  go and
[3526.12 --> 3526.94]  become a
[3526.94 --> 3527.42]  neighbor to
[3527.42 --> 3527.98]  those in
[3527.98 --> 3528.74]  need no
[3528.74 --> 3529.22]  matter how
[3529.22 --> 3529.88]  alien they
[3529.88 --> 3530.34]  may be
[3530.34 --> 3531.78]  it's not
[3531.78 --> 3532.22]  just a matter
[3532.22 --> 3532.72]  of loving
[3532.72 --> 3533.22]  and serving
[3533.22 --> 3533.68]  those who
[3533.68 --> 3534.16]  are near
[3534.16 --> 3534.66]  us but
[3534.66 --> 3535.72]  also drawing
[3535.72 --> 3536.46]  near to
[3536.46 --> 3537.14]  those who
[3537.14 --> 3537.80]  are for
[3537.80 --> 3538.20]  whatever
[3538.20 --> 3538.76]  reason
[3538.76 --> 3539.68]  racial
[3539.68 --> 3540.24]  ethnic
[3540.24 --> 3540.82]  theological
[3540.82 --> 3541.38]  political
[3541.38 --> 3542.56]  may seem
[3542.56 --> 3543.08]  alien
[3543.08 --> 3544.30]  to us
[3544.30 --> 3547.06]  that's the
[3547.06 --> 3548.02]  amazing thing
[3548.02 --> 3548.50]  that's going
[3548.50 --> 3549.54]  on in this
[3549.54 --> 3550.10]  story it's
[3550.10 --> 3550.54]  not about
[3550.54 --> 3551.32]  figuring out
[3551.32 --> 3552.14]  who is or
[3552.14 --> 3552.78]  who isn't
[3552.78 --> 3553.70]  your neighbor
[3553.70 --> 3554.50]  right when
[3554.50 --> 3554.92]  you start
[3554.92 --> 3555.36]  trying to
[3555.36 --> 3556.00]  parse that
[3556.00 --> 3557.44]  out you've
[3557.44 --> 3557.78]  missed the
[3557.78 --> 3558.10]  point of
[3558.10 --> 3558.86]  Jesus parable
[3558.86 --> 3561.32]  instead this
[3561.32 --> 3561.78]  is about
[3561.78 --> 3563.52]  you being
[3563.52 --> 3564.54]  neighborly
[3564.54 --> 3566.26]  this isn't
[3566.26 --> 3566.62]  about trying
[3566.62 --> 3567.06]  to figure out
[3567.06 --> 3567.96]  who is your
[3567.96 --> 3568.54]  neighbor but
[3568.54 --> 3569.56]  how you are
[3569.56 --> 3570.12]  a neighbor
[3570.12 --> 3571.36]  to everyone
[3571.36 --> 3572.54]  it's not
[3572.54 --> 3573.14]  about them
[3573.14 --> 3574.78]  it's about
[3574.78 --> 3575.30]  us
[3575.30 --> 3577.80]  this is
[3577.80 --> 3578.32]  about you
[3578.32 --> 3578.96]  serving
[3578.96 --> 3579.88]  anyone
[3579.88 --> 3580.98]  and everyone
[3580.98 --> 3582.74]  anything else
[3582.74 --> 3584.38]  is just an
[3584.38 --> 3585.18]  excuse to be
[3585.18 --> 3585.68]  selfish
[3585.68 --> 3588.72]  now the
[3588.72 --> 3589.34]  miracle of
[3589.34 --> 3589.94]  the church
[3589.94 --> 3590.46]  the miracle
[3590.46 --> 3591.42]  that is the
[3591.42 --> 3591.96]  body of
[3591.96 --> 3592.32]  Christ
[3592.32 --> 3593.00]  is that
[3593.00 --> 3593.76]  God takes
[3593.76 --> 3594.70]  people who
[3594.70 --> 3595.20]  would be
[3595.20 --> 3595.88]  natural
[3595.88 --> 3596.58]  enemies
[3596.58 --> 3597.84]  and he
[3597.84 --> 3598.46]  makes us
[3598.46 --> 3599.14]  brothers and
[3599.14 --> 3599.64]  sisters
[3599.64 --> 3599.76]  sisters
[3599.76 --> 3602.36]  all right
[3602.36 --> 3602.74]  this is an
[3602.74 --> 3604.02]  example here
[3604.02 --> 3604.76]  and this one
[3604.76 --> 3605.60]  is for the
[3605.60 --> 3607.16]  kids and I
[3607.16 --> 3607.60]  can get away
[3607.60 --> 3607.88]  with this
[3607.88 --> 3608.34]  because my
[3608.34 --> 3608.82]  kids are not
[3608.82 --> 3609.22]  in service
[3609.22 --> 3609.68]  today they're
[3609.68 --> 3610.08]  helping in
[3610.08 --> 3610.44]  children's
[3610.44 --> 3610.92]  worship time
[3610.92 --> 3611.82]  so I won't
[3611.82 --> 3612.26]  get in trouble
[3612.26 --> 3612.66]  for using
[3612.66 --> 3613.08]  them as a
[3613.08 --> 3613.30]  negative
[3613.30 --> 3613.78]  example
[3613.78 --> 3617.40]  I ask my
[3617.40 --> 3618.20]  kids all
[3618.20 --> 3619.00]  the time to
[3619.00 --> 3619.68]  to do
[3619.68 --> 3620.24]  something to
[3620.24 --> 3620.64]  help with
[3620.64 --> 3621.50]  something to
[3621.50 --> 3622.14]  clean up a
[3622.14 --> 3622.68]  mess that's
[3622.68 --> 3623.10]  in the in
[3623.10 --> 3623.60]  the playroom
[3623.60 --> 3625.66]  and Nora
[3625.66 --> 3626.36]  will say
[3626.36 --> 3627.58]  Malachi made
[3627.58 --> 3628.32]  that mess I
[3628.32 --> 3628.68]  don't have to
[3628.68 --> 3629.28]  clean it up
[3629.28 --> 3630.72]  Malachi will
[3630.72 --> 3631.26]  say Nora
[3631.26 --> 3631.86]  did that
[3631.86 --> 3632.60]  that's not
[3632.60 --> 3633.18]  my job
[3633.18 --> 3635.08]  and as true
[3635.08 --> 3635.60]  as that may
[3635.60 --> 3636.52]  be right
[3636.52 --> 3636.96]  what the
[3636.96 --> 3637.80]  story of the
[3637.80 --> 3638.48]  good Samaritan
[3638.48 --> 3639.46]  is telling us
[3639.46 --> 3640.20]  is that that
[3640.20 --> 3640.74]  doesn't matter
[3640.74 --> 3642.44]  instead
[3642.44 --> 3644.14]  kids and
[3644.14 --> 3644.78]  my kids
[3644.78 --> 3645.48]  please hear
[3645.48 --> 3645.78]  from a
[3645.78 --> 3646.10]  distance
[3646.10 --> 3647.20]  take this
[3647.20 --> 3647.48]  as an
[3647.48 --> 3648.12]  opportunity
[3648.12 --> 3649.28]  right to
[3649.28 --> 3650.58]  to love
[3650.58 --> 3651.70]  like God
[3651.70 --> 3652.28]  loves you
[3652.28 --> 3653.82]  right if you
[3653.82 --> 3654.16]  would like
[3654.16 --> 3654.66]  someone to
[3654.66 --> 3655.24]  clean up your
[3655.24 --> 3656.34]  toys be the
[3656.34 --> 3657.14]  kind of kid
[3657.14 --> 3657.76]  who cleans up
[3657.76 --> 3658.40]  someone else's
[3658.40 --> 3659.98]  toys or if
[3659.98 --> 3660.38]  you would like
[3660.38 --> 3661.62]  to be included
[3661.62 --> 3662.54]  in playing with
[3662.54 --> 3663.40]  other kids be
[3663.40 --> 3663.94]  the kind of
[3663.94 --> 3664.46]  kid who
[3664.46 --> 3665.72]  includes others
[3665.72 --> 3666.10]  in your
[3666.10 --> 3666.52]  playing
[3666.52 --> 3670.04]  now parents
[3670.04 --> 3670.68]  and older
[3670.68 --> 3671.32]  people among
[3671.32 --> 3672.56]  us that's a
[3672.56 --> 3673.10]  pretty easy
[3673.10 --> 3673.80]  zoom out am
[3673.80 --> 3674.18]  I right
[3674.18 --> 3675.50]  right whatever
[3675.50 --> 3676.40]  age you are
[3676.40 --> 3677.16]  this isn't
[3677.16 --> 3677.88]  about putting
[3677.88 --> 3678.66]  limits on
[3678.66 --> 3679.40]  living the
[3679.40 --> 3679.92]  love of
[3679.92 --> 3680.82]  God right
[3680.82 --> 3681.72]  God's love
[3681.72 --> 3682.42]  was big enough
[3682.42 --> 3683.00]  to include
[3683.00 --> 3683.80]  you while you
[3683.80 --> 3684.38]  were sinners
[3684.38 --> 3685.06]  and enemies
[3685.06 --> 3687.34]  make your
[3687.34 --> 3687.94]  love big
[3687.94 --> 3688.46]  enough to
[3688.46 --> 3688.96]  include
[3688.96 --> 3689.64]  another
[3689.64 --> 3690.32]  neighbor or
[3690.32 --> 3690.98]  stranger or
[3690.98 --> 3692.38]  alien or
[3692.38 --> 3692.72]  enemy
[3692.72 --> 3697.92]  all right so
[3697.92 --> 3699.14]  far we've
[3699.14 --> 3700.36]  seen two
[3700.36 --> 3702.64]  real life
[3702.64 --> 3703.90]  applications from
[3703.90 --> 3704.52]  this parable
[3704.52 --> 3705.28]  we've seen two
[3705.28 --> 3706.38]  ways that this
[3706.38 --> 3707.22]  connects if you
[3707.22 --> 3707.92]  love God you
[3707.92 --> 3708.52]  will love your
[3708.52 --> 3709.64]  neighbor and it
[3709.64 --> 3710.36]  doesn't matter who
[3710.36 --> 3710.84]  you might be
[3710.84 --> 3711.88]  interacting with it
[3711.88 --> 3712.86]  matters that you
[3712.86 --> 3714.00]  that we are the
[3714.00 --> 3715.00]  Christ like
[3715.00 --> 3715.62]  neighbor and so
[3715.62 --> 3717.02]  here's where I
[3717.02 --> 3717.48]  want to end
[3717.48 --> 3719.62]  because it would
[3719.62 --> 3720.56]  be easy to take
[3720.56 --> 3722.28]  this parable and
[3722.28 --> 3722.98]  in fact many
[3722.98 --> 3724.12]  before me have
[3724.12 --> 3724.90]  done this
[3724.90 --> 3728.84]  it would be easy
[3728.84 --> 3729.44]  to take this
[3729.44 --> 3730.96]  parable especially
[3730.96 --> 3731.98]  in part because
[3731.98 --> 3733.58]  it starts off with
[3733.58 --> 3734.24]  the question what
[3734.24 --> 3735.40]  must I do to
[3735.40 --> 3736.62]  inherit eternal
[3736.62 --> 3737.56]  life and it ends
[3737.56 --> 3738.38]  with Jesus saying
[3738.38 --> 3739.34]  go and do
[3739.34 --> 3740.82]  likewise it would
[3740.82 --> 3741.70]  be easy to take
[3741.70 --> 3742.52]  this parable and
[3742.52 --> 3743.16]  then turn it
[3743.16 --> 3743.96]  into a sort of
[3743.96 --> 3745.52]  checklist of
[3745.52 --> 3747.62]  things to do and
[3747.62 --> 3748.24]  when we turn this
[3748.24 --> 3749.18]  into a checklist of
[3749.18 --> 3750.22]  things to do we
[3750.22 --> 3751.86]  end up I'm afraid
[3751.86 --> 3753.34]  that of leaving
[3753.34 --> 3754.72]  this place feeling
[3754.72 --> 3755.40]  more heavily
[3755.40 --> 3756.54]  burdened with
[3756.54 --> 3757.08]  something that
[3757.08 --> 3757.90]  something else I
[3757.90 --> 3758.86]  have to do right
[3758.86 --> 3760.30]  another box I have
[3760.30 --> 3761.24]  to check another
[3761.24 --> 3762.66]  weight that is on
[3762.66 --> 3763.62]  my shoulders so
[3763.62 --> 3764.70]  that I can be a
[3764.70 --> 3765.98]  good person or a
[3765.98 --> 3767.46]  good enough person
[3767.46 --> 3769.36]  but again if we do
[3769.36 --> 3770.06]  that with this
[3770.06 --> 3771.54]  parable we miss the
[3771.54 --> 3772.54]  mark of what Jesus
[3772.54 --> 3773.70]  is teaching we
[3773.70 --> 3774.80]  miss the mark of
[3774.80 --> 3775.54]  the gospel because
[3775.54 --> 3778.12]  you see Jesus is
[3778.12 --> 3780.26]  the ultimate good
[3780.26 --> 3781.02]  Samaritan
[3781.02 --> 3785.78]  Jesus was despised
[3785.78 --> 3787.54]  and rejected by his
[3787.54 --> 3789.02]  own and yet he
[3789.02 --> 3790.92]  heals us from sin
[3790.92 --> 3792.40]  and death he takes
[3792.40 --> 3793.80]  our shame and
[3793.80 --> 3795.28]  clothes us with his
[3795.28 --> 3797.14]  righteousness he
[3797.14 --> 3798.70]  brings us to the to
[3798.70 --> 3799.88]  the father's house
[3799.88 --> 3800.96]  where a room is
[3800.96 --> 3802.24]  already waiting for
[3802.24 --> 3804.54]  you that's how the
[3804.54 --> 3805.78]  good Samaritan changes
[3805.78 --> 3806.98]  your life because the
[3806.98 --> 3807.84]  true and better good
[3807.84 --> 3809.04]  Samaritan is Jesus
[3809.04 --> 3811.74]  right you can see it
[3811.74 --> 3812.70]  that the expert in the
[3812.70 --> 3814.18]  law asks what must I
[3814.18 --> 3816.14]  do to inherit eternal
[3816.14 --> 3817.40]  life let me ask you
[3817.40 --> 3818.28]  this question what do
[3818.28 --> 3819.48]  you do to inherit
[3819.48 --> 3820.18]  anything
[3820.18 --> 3822.70]  nothing
[3823.38 --> 3825.48]  right you don't earn
[3825.48 --> 3828.54]  inheritance right it is
[3828.54 --> 3830.38]  freely or begrudgingly
[3830.38 --> 3832.32]  given but it's given to
[3832.32 --> 3834.40]  you in fact we'll
[3834.40 --> 3835.60]  stretch the metaphor a
[3835.60 --> 3836.74]  little further right the
[3836.74 --> 3838.56]  only time ordinarily you
[3838.56 --> 3840.98]  get an inheritance is when
[3840.98 --> 3844.28]  someone dies that's what
[3844.28 --> 3847.08]  Jesus does he dies to give
[3847.08 --> 3848.48]  you an eternal inheritance
[3848.48 --> 3851.52]  from the father he dies so
[3851.52 --> 3852.82]  that that you might have
[3852.82 --> 3855.28]  life and that life starts
[3855.28 --> 3857.76]  right now and that life
[3857.76 --> 3860.30]  looks a certain way
[3860.30 --> 3863.78]  what does that life look
[3863.78 --> 3864.86]  like you ask
[3864.86 --> 3868.14]  that's the same question as
[3868.14 --> 3870.80]  who was a neighbor to this
[3870.80 --> 3873.44]  man that the life of Jesus
[3873.44 --> 3876.14]  begs the question in you to
[3876.14 --> 3879.12]  whom will you be a neighbor
[3879.12 --> 3882.04]  it's because Jesus lived the
[3882.04 --> 3883.34]  life I should have lived and
[3883.34 --> 3884.92]  died the death that I
[3884.92 --> 3886.16]  that I deserved it is
[3886.16 --> 3887.92]  because Jesus found me
[3887.92 --> 3889.96]  lifeless and broken on the
[3889.96 --> 3890.90]  side of the road and
[3890.90 --> 3892.42]  restored my life is because
[3892.42 --> 3894.28]  of Jesus that I have tasted
[3894.28 --> 3896.12]  and seen the love that the
[3896.12 --> 3898.10]  father has lavished on us it
[3898.10 --> 3899.78]  is because of Jesus that I
[3899.78 --> 3902.22]  now that that we now who
[3902.22 --> 3904.40]  know him and who love him can
[3904.40 --> 3907.82]  love the God who saves it is
[3907.82 --> 3909.22]  because of Jesus that we can
[3909.22 --> 3910.94]  now love our neighbor or the
[3910.94 --> 3912.90]  stranger or the alien or even
[3912.90 --> 3915.06]  the enemy it is because of
[3915.06 --> 3917.90]  Jesus that we get to be
[3917.90 --> 3921.40]  neighbors and that is real
[3921.40 --> 3923.82]  life gospel living that is
[3923.82 --> 3926.76]  living the way of Jesus as the
[3926.76 --> 3929.86]  only truly way to live or the
[3929.86 --> 3934.14]  only way to truly live our sin
[3934.14 --> 3936.12]  that makes us enemies of God
[3936.12 --> 3939.12]  but thanks be to God in grace he
[3939.12 --> 3941.78]  makes us his children through his
[3941.78 --> 3945.04]  love and by grace we get to live
[3945.04 --> 3949.02]  that life of love as neighbors to
[3949.02 --> 3949.44]  all
[3949.44 --> 3955.94]  if you know true and better good
[3955.94 --> 3956.50]  Samaritan
[3956.50 --> 3962.10]  you get to be the neighbor to all
[3962.10 --> 3967.20]  who you find on your path that is
[3967.20 --> 3969.48]  how the love of God is made real in
[3969.48 --> 3973.62]  the world today amen let's pray
[3973.62 --> 3973.98]  together
[3973.98 --> 3982.44]  Lord our God reveal to us in power
[3982.44 --> 3986.80]  your amazing love in the gospel as we
[3986.80 --> 3989.20]  look to the story of your good news as
[3989.20 --> 3991.08]  we look to the story of the
[3991.08 --> 3993.72]  incarnation of Jesus his perfect life
[3993.72 --> 3995.38]  lived in our place as we look to the
[3995.38 --> 3997.50]  truth of his death on the cross and
[3997.50 --> 3999.56]  the truth of his resurrection three
[3999.56 --> 4001.42]  days later as we look to the truth of
[4001.42 --> 4003.54]  his ascension to the right hand of the
[4003.54 --> 4005.38]  father as we look to the truth as that
[4005.38 --> 4007.08]  he and the father from there have sent
[4007.08 --> 4009.58]  to us the Holy Spirit that we now
[4009.58 --> 4012.28]  might have lives transformed that we
[4012.28 --> 4016.28]  now might be new creations make us new
[4016.28 --> 4022.14]  in your love we pray make us new so
[4022.14 --> 4027.70]  that we can go and live that love in
[4027.70 --> 4028.12]  the world
[4028.12 --> 4034.64]  God whatever we have put in the way of
[4034.64 --> 4037.46]  living your love and experiencing more
[4037.46 --> 4042.02]  of it we pray pierce through directly to
[4042.02 --> 4042.96]  our hearts
[4042.96 --> 4046.94]  that we might come to Jesus the true and
[4046.94 --> 4048.24]  better good Samaritan that he might
[4048.24 --> 4049.46]  bind us up
[4049.46 --> 4052.58]  and send us on our way restored
[4052.58 --> 4056.16]  it is in his name we pray
[4056.16 --> 4057.56]  amen
[4057.56 --> 4059.56]  amen
[4059.56 --> 4063.26]  amen
[4063.26 --> 4089.14]  To the desperate eyes and reaching hands,
[4089.14 --> 4094.14]  To the suffering and the lame,
[4094.14 --> 4099.14]  To the ones the world has cast aside,
[4099.14 --> 4104.14]  Where you want me, I will be.
[4104.14 --> 4108.14]  I will go, I will go, I will go,
[4108.14 --> 4110.14]  I will go, I will send me to the world,
[4110.14 --> 4114.14]  To the lost, to the poor and lonely,
[4114.14 --> 4117.14]  To the guilty that I am,
[4117.14 --> 4119.14]  And clear within your hands,
[4119.14 --> 4126.14]  I will go, I will go, I will go, I will go, I will go, I will go, I will go, I will go.
[4126.14 --> 4129.14]  Be blind with privilege,
[4129.14 --> 4135.14]  Give me eyes to see the pain,
[4135.14 --> 4140.14]  And the blessing you poured out on me,
[4140.14 --> 4145.14]  Will not be spent on me in pain.
[4145.14 --> 4150.14]  And the life made me used for you.
[4150.14 --> 4156.14]  I'm a woman, I'm a woman, I'm a woman who was sent to me.
[4156.14 --> 4161.14]  To the lost, to the poor and lonely,
[4161.14 --> 4163.14]  And the guilty that I am,
[4163.14 --> 4172.14]  I will go, I will go, I will go, I will go, I will go, I will go, I will go.
[4172.14 --> 4177.14]  I want to live for you, the way you need me.
[4177.14 --> 4182.14]  I want to follow you.
[4182.14 --> 4187.14]  I want to live for you, the way you need me.
[4187.14 --> 4190.14]  I want to follow you.
[4190.14 --> 4191.14]  I want to live for you.
[4191.14 --> 4196.14]  I want to live for you, the way you need me.
[4196.14 --> 4199.14]  I want to follow you.
[4199.14 --> 4209.14]  I want to go, I will go, I will go, I will go, Lord, send me to the poor,
[4209.14 --> 4214.14]  To the lost, to the poor and lonely,
[4214.14 --> 4215.14]  I want to live for you.
[4215.14 --> 4216.14]  I want to come, if you make everything I am,
[4216.14 --> 4217.14]  I want to live for you and me.
[4217.14 --> 4219.14]  I want to gain something with you, the way I will get.
[4219.14 --> 4223.70]  I will go, I will go, send me to you.
[4224.44 --> 4237.70]  I will go, I will go, I will go, I will go, send me to the world, to the light, to the glory, and I will be the glory of my help.
[4237.70 --> 4244.70]  I will go, I will go, send me to you.
[4244.70 --> 4251.70]  I will go, send me to you.
[4262.42 --> 4267.08]  As you go, know that God himself goes with us.
[4267.22 --> 4274.38]  And before you go, please feel free to stick around and spend some time in fellowship after the service.
[4274.38 --> 4280.14]  assuming everything worked well, there should be coffee and refreshments. If not, there's just
[4280.14 --> 4287.16]  good company, and we all could use some good company, right? Right, no, just give me coffee.
[4287.16 --> 4294.18]  There's no coffee. I'm not. Stick around. Receive the blessing of our God for the journey ahead.
[4295.74 --> 4304.02]  May God go before you to guide you. May God go behind you to protect you. May God go beneath
[4304.02 --> 4311.52]  you to support you. May God go beside you to befriend you. Let the blessing of God come
[4311.52 --> 4322.64]  upon you today. Do not be afraid, but go in peace to love and serve the Lord. Amen.
[4334.02 --> 4362.02]  I will send the blinding demon, He who took the most for me. I've been purchased, I've been pardoned, bound to Him. I'm truly free. I will feel.
