[0.00 --> 2.48]  We
[14.26 --> 16.30]  We
[16.30 --> 28.22]  We
[28.22 --> 32.38]  final
[32.38 --> 36.28]  We'll be immovable.
[37.12 --> 39.32]  Break the unbreakable.
[40.18 --> 41.82]  God, we believe.
[42.38 --> 45.68]  God, we believe for it.
[46.12 --> 48.06]  From the impossible.
[49.18 --> 51.16]  We'll see a miracle.
[52.30 --> 53.88]  God, we believe.
[55.26 --> 58.14]  God, we believe for it.
[58.14 --> 59.50]  God, we believe.
[60.20 --> 61.38]  Yes, we do.
[61.38 --> 67.38]  Believe for it
[67.38 --> 80.66]  You said it, I believe it
[80.66 --> 86.44]  You said it, it is done
[86.44 --> 92.88]  You said it, I believe it
[92.88 --> 98.44]  You said it, it is done
[98.44 --> 105.44]  You said it, and I believe it
[105.44 --> 111.44]  You said it, it is done
[111.44 --> 118.20]  Just because you said it, I can trust you with it
[118.20 --> 121.88]  You said it, it is done
[121.88 --> 125.88]  You said it, it is done
[125.88 --> 128.88]  You said it, it is done
[128.88 --> 132.88]  You said it, it is done
[132.88 --> 135.88]  It is done

[144.88 --> 147.88]  God, we believe for it
[147.88 --> 150.88]  From the impossible

[156.88 --> 162.88]  God, we believe for it
[162.88 --> 165.88]  Yes, Lord

[174.88 --> 185.38]  You said it, it is done
[185.38 --> 196.32]  I believe something happens when you gather
[196.32 --> 201.52]  There's something happens when we gather
[201.52 --> 206.86]  When hearts in line with our hearts
[206.86 --> 214.50]  We feel the moving spirit to come alive
[214.50 --> 223.12]  There's a longing when we gather
[223.12 --> 228.42]  To see your glory touch the ear
[228.42 --> 236.42]  We believe that it can happen right now
[240.42 --> 246.82]  Oh, we're calling heaven down
[246.82 --> 252.00]  Oh, until it's all around
[252.00 --> 254.34]  His kingdom is alive

[448.82 --> 450.32]  We're gonna pray.
[451.40 --> 453.46]  We might get lost.
[454.20 --> 455.42]  But we don't care.

[501.30 --> 501.90]  Hallelujah!
[501.90 --> 524.56]  Good morning, everyone.
[525.72 --> 527.86]  Welcome to church.
[527.86 --> 533.76]  We are really excited once again this week to gather together to worship our God.
[533.86 --> 537.86]  If you're joining us online, we're grateful that you are here with us as well.
[538.50 --> 542.84]  For those of you who are here present, when you came in, you found one of these on your
[542.84 --> 544.80]  seats or on the seat beside you.
[545.28 --> 552.56]  Today we are beginning a sermon series through the month of June on different holy habits
[552.56 --> 553.68]  and spiritual disciplines.
[553.68 --> 561.32]  And so we are providing this for you to work alongside in devotion and in a life of faith
[561.32 --> 566.60]  together and to jot notes, to get some ideas, connect you to resources and the like.
[567.04 --> 571.14]  If you weren't able to get one, grab me after the service.
[571.32 --> 571.86]  We have more.
[572.06 --> 575.94]  We have a cart full yet to give out, but we have plenty there.
[576.30 --> 580.58]  And we will use these over the course of the next month together.
[580.58 --> 585.46]  As well, if you're visiting with us this morning, we would love to connect with you.
[586.00 --> 590.24]  And so there are these cards available on the back table there as well.
[590.34 --> 592.08]  There's a version online.
[592.24 --> 594.88]  You can scan the QR code and connect with us in that way.
[595.30 --> 601.40]  We'd love to connect with you and see how we can bless you and serve you in our church
[601.40 --> 601.70]  family.
[601.70 --> 607.38]  If you are visiting, you don't know who I am, but my name is Chris and I'm one of the
[607.38 --> 611.14]  pastors here and it's my privilege to lead in worship this morning.
[611.50 --> 612.98]  We have a couple other announcements.
[613.14 --> 615.88]  I'm going to get Josh to come up as he makes an announcement.
[616.10 --> 622.68]  And also there is a reminder that Youth Coffee is happening at the Alchemist House.
[623.28 --> 624.90]  And so Rob and Brenda, are you around?
[625.02 --> 626.84]  Can you just raise your hand?
[626.92 --> 627.32]  Where are you?
[627.48 --> 628.36]  Rob, Brenda, no?
[629.58 --> 630.28]  They're both gone.
[630.28 --> 631.48]  Okay, there you go.
[631.86 --> 632.68]  You can talk to Jared.
[632.76 --> 633.76]  He'll tell you where it is.
[634.56 --> 635.06]  He knows.
[635.50 --> 636.80]  I did see Brenda earlier.
[638.54 --> 639.60]  Okay, all right.
[639.94 --> 640.80]  Oh, she's ignoring me.
[640.86 --> 641.34]  I see her now.
[641.80 --> 642.00]  Good.
[642.42 --> 644.70]  If you have questions about where that is, you can grab them.
[644.86 --> 650.42]  And that's available for anyone in the youth age, so high school age kids, go on out and
[650.42 --> 653.56]  have coffee and lunch together there.
[654.00 --> 654.48]  Josh, go ahead.
[655.30 --> 657.56]  Hey, this is a young adults announcement.
[657.56 --> 658.94]  We're having the Pollock tonight.
[658.94 --> 664.50]  We're having it here at the church, though there might be a location change.
[664.82 --> 666.68]  So it will be in the group chat.
[666.80 --> 670.34]  If you're not a part of the group chat, I'm using this as a way to get in contact with
[670.34 --> 670.70]  you all.
[670.94 --> 676.36]  So come and contact me here after or through text and I'll get you connected.
[677.64 --> 678.38]  Yeah, it's going to be great.
[678.46 --> 678.92]  Bring a food.
[679.34 --> 679.80]  Bring friends.
[680.08 --> 680.66]  It's going to be awesome.
[680.66 --> 682.56]  7 p.m.
[682.56 --> 692.28]  Also, you may have noticed on your way in, there's a lost and found table at the back
[692.28 --> 694.34]  there that is really full of stuff.
[695.02 --> 699.56]  I don't know if it's stuff from us here or if it's from the school that rents from throughout
[699.56 --> 699.86]  the week.
[699.96 --> 702.00]  But have a look if you're missing something.
[702.48 --> 704.36]  We're going to keep it there for this week and next.
[704.66 --> 707.48]  And if it's not emptied by the end of next week, we're going to donate it.
[708.28 --> 712.02]  So at the end of next week, if you want to go and grab something before it gets donated,
[712.60 --> 713.52]  you could do that too.
[713.84 --> 715.82]  But that's what's going to happen there.
[716.14 --> 720.06]  I know that there's a beautiful shirt in there that someone in my family has an eye on.
[720.30 --> 721.44]  So just saying.
[721.44 --> 729.76]  Before we begin, I did want to make one announcement about a prayer night that we're going to do
[729.76 --> 732.20]  this week on Wednesday.
[734.78 --> 742.74]  I don't know how many of you are aware or have been experiencing, but this week it really
[742.74 --> 743.14]  hit me.
[743.86 --> 750.90]  There's a lot happening in our lives and in our church, both that is really hard and
[750.90 --> 754.50]  struggling and that we need prayer in.
[754.60 --> 760.40]  And what I'm confident of is that if this isn't a spiritual attack on us as a church,
[760.48 --> 766.28]  and it may be, it does have an effect on our spiritual selves and our relationships to God.
[766.82 --> 768.88]  And so when that happens, the church needs to pray.
[770.16 --> 776.08]  And so on Wednesday night, we're going to gather together informally and we're going to pray
[776.08 --> 779.36]  through a bunch of different themes, circumstances, and situations.
[779.36 --> 783.94]  Now, we're going to do that without names.
[784.30 --> 787.24]  And so if you are someone who's going through something and you have talked to me in the
[787.24 --> 789.80]  past, know that we're not airing all of that out.
[789.92 --> 793.66]  But there are things that I believe we need to pray for.
[794.30 --> 798.02]  And so I want to invite you to gather on Wednesday night.
[798.08 --> 799.30]  I think it says 7, right?
[799.52 --> 800.24]  7 p.m.
[800.24 --> 807.66]  Here at the church with as many people as come and we will pray as informally and boldly and
[807.66 --> 812.84]  quietly and in groups and individually and silently as we can.
[813.80 --> 816.58]  But we're going to take at least an hour and pray together.
[816.78 --> 824.18]  So I encourage you strongly join us on Wednesday night for that time together.
[824.18 --> 830.14]  As well, as you look at the stage, you might realize that something is on fire and that's
[830.14 --> 831.72]  because today is Pentecost.
[832.60 --> 838.36]  And as we worship our God today, we remember that today Pentecost changed the church.
[839.44 --> 841.48]  Were it not for Pentecost, you would not be here.
[843.12 --> 847.52]  Were it not for Pentecost, you would not profess to believe or struggle in belief.
[847.52 --> 850.78]  You would not be asking the kinds of questions that the Spirit puts on your heart.
[851.06 --> 855.12]  And so we are here today because of Pentecost.
[855.64 --> 860.22]  And so let's worship in the Spirit and in truth our good God.
[860.66 --> 861.28]  Would you stand?
[861.78 --> 867.74]  We could be greeted by God, welcomed into his presence, and we can worship him.
[870.12 --> 876.28]  Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ,
[876.28 --> 880.12]  and from the Holy Spirit who comes at Pentecost.
[880.82 --> 884.26]  Let us worship our God.
[884.96 --> 885.26]  Amen.
[889.72 --> 893.12]  Our call to worship today comes from Acts 1, 4-5.
[894.40 --> 900.02]  On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command.
[900.02 --> 906.22]  Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift of my Father promised.
[906.28 --> 908.80]  which you have heard me speak about.
[909.50 --> 916.44]  For John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.
[917.38 --> 921.20]  Let's worship our God, who so freely gives us his Spirit.
[921.20 --> 924.60]  Strength who rises, we wait upon the Lord, we will wait upon the Lord.
[924.60 --> 925.54]  If the Lord is good, we will lift him up and be with God.
[925.54 --> 927.10]  Help us understand.
[927.10 --> 927.48]  Amen.
[927.48 --> 928.66]  For all you will be fired by God, who they are going tosex Loras,
[928.66 --> 943.38]  and ourコ
[943.40 --> 945.50]  strength remembers Him as We Ugh
[945.50 --> 948.38]  Strength will rise as we wait upon the Lord.
[948.46 --> 950.62]  We will wait upon the Lord.
[950.70 --> 952.96]  We will wait upon the Lord.
[954.18 --> 957.50]  Strength will rise as we wait upon the Lord.
[957.56 --> 959.82]  We will wait upon the Lord.
[959.90 --> 962.18]  We will wait upon the Lord.
[962.18 --> 968.98]  How come you reign forever?
[970.12 --> 974.64]  Our hope, our strong delay.
[975.50 --> 977.06]  Ever.
[979.54 --> 984.24]  You are the everlasting God.
[984.88 --> 988.82]  The everlasting God.
[988.82 --> 991.98]  You do not faint.
[992.18 --> 996.34]  You won't grow weary.
[997.70 --> 1002.38]  You're the defender of the weak.
[1002.38 --> 1006.76]  You comfort doors in me.
[1007.76 --> 1014.84]  You lift us upon wings like eagles.
[1014.84 --> 1019.08]  Strength will rise as we wait upon the Lord.
[1019.14 --> 1021.28]  We will wait upon the Lord.
[1021.34 --> 1023.58]  We will wait upon the Lord.
[1023.58 --> 1028.28]  We will wait upon the Lord.
[1028.28 --> 1030.36]  We will wait upon the Lord.
[1030.36 --> 1032.62]  We will wait upon the Lord.
[1032.70 --> 1037.20]  How come you reign forever?
[1037.20 --> 1041.98]  You are the everlasting God.
[1041.98 --> 1054.04]  You are the everlasting God.
[1054.04 --> 1061.04]  You do not faint.
[1061.04 --> 1066.04]  You won't grow weary.
[1066.04 --> 1071.82]  You are the defender of the weak.
[1071.82 --> 1076.82]  You are the everlasting God.
[1076.82 --> 1081.20]  You are the everlasting God.
[1081.20 --> 1085.08]  My King of us.
[1085.08 --> 1089.94]  You are the everlasting God.
[1089.94 --> 1090.94]  You do not faint.
[1090.94 --> 1091.94]  You are the everlasting God.
[1091.94 --> 1096.94]  You do not faint.
[1096.94 --> 1101.94]  You won't grow weary.
[1101.94 --> 1107.32]  You are the defender of the weak.
[1107.32 --> 1109.32]  You are the everlasting God.
[1109.32 --> 1113.32]  You are the everlasting God.
[1113.32 --> 1118.32]  You will lift us upon wings like eagles.
[1118.32 --> 1124.32]  You are the everlasting God.
[1124.32 --> 1154.30]  Thank you.
[1154.32 --> 1163.36]  You give life, you are love, you bring light to the darkness.
[1163.36 --> 1172.42]  You give hope, you restore every heart that is broken.
[1175.30 --> 1179.48]  And great are you, Lord.
[1179.48 --> 1188.52]  It's your breath in our lungs, so we pour out our praise.
[1188.52 --> 1194.52]  We pour out our praise, it's your breath in our lungs.
[1194.68 --> 1199.30]  So we pour out our praise to you only.
[1199.30 --> 1212.42]  You give life, you are love.
[1212.68 --> 1216.30]  You bring light to the darkness.
[1216.30 --> 1225.62]  You give hope, you restore every heart that is broken.
[1225.62 --> 1234.66]  You give life, you are love.
[1234.66 --> 1241.22]  It's your breath in our lungs, so we pour out our praise.
[1241.46 --> 1243.20]  We pour out our praise.
[1243.26 --> 1251.58]  It's your breath in our lungs, so we pour out our praise to you only.
[1251.58 --> 1258.82]  It's your breath in our lungs, so we pour out our praise.
[1258.82 --> 1260.78]  We pour out our praise.
[1260.78 --> 1269.78]  It's your breath in our lungs, so we pour out our praise to you only.
[1269.78 --> 1284.78]  We pour out our praise to you only.
[1284.78 --> 1286.78]  Our hearts and our lungs, so we pour out our praise.
[1286.78 --> 1290.80]  And all the earth will shout your praise.
[1290.80 --> 1295.80]  Our hearts will cry, these bones will sing,
[1296.04 --> 1302.86]  Great are you, Lord.
[1302.86 --> 1308.82]  And all the earth will shout your praise.
[1308.82 --> 1313.04]  Our hearts will cry, these bones will sing.
[1313.04 --> 1319.68]  Great are you, Lord.
[1321.26 --> 1326.00]  And all the earth will shout your praise.
[1326.34 --> 1330.52]  Our hearts will cry, these bones will sing.
[1331.06 --> 1337.20]  Great are you, Lord.
[1337.20 --> 1342.62]  It's your breath in our lives.
[1342.82 --> 1345.60]  So we pour out our grace.
[1345.80 --> 1347.58]  We pour out our praise.
[1347.68 --> 1351.38]  It's your breath in our lives.
[1351.64 --> 1356.02]  So we pour out our praise to you, O Lord.
[1356.36 --> 1360.28]  It's your breath in our lives.
[1360.56 --> 1363.36]  So we pour out our praise.
[1363.64 --> 1365.36]  We pour out our praise.
[1365.36 --> 1366.36]  It's your breath.
[1367.20 --> 1374.00]  In our lungs shall we pour out our praise to you only.
[1374.00 --> 1403.98]  In our lungs shall we pour out our praise to you only.
[1404.00 --> 1408.88]  The blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting.
[1410.18 --> 1416.60]  They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them.
[1417.62 --> 1424.24]  All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.
[1425.36 --> 1426.26]  Let's bow our heads.
[1427.88 --> 1433.74]  Father, we confess how we need the presence of your Spirit in our lives.
[1434.00 --> 1442.60]  Father, we will open the eyes of our heart to know the reality of your indwelling and to see you more clearly.
[1444.32 --> 1446.52]  Deepen our love for you.
[1446.52 --> 1453.24]  Fill us with your power to follow you and to show your love to those around us.
[1453.82 --> 1457.26]  Give us boldness to stand for you in the culture we live in.
[1458.16 --> 1463.64]  And as we join in heaven's worship, help us to fully express our gratitude to you.
[1464.18 --> 1464.40]  Amen.
[1464.40 --> 1471.38]  Why don't we stand as we sing these last two songs.
[1471.38 --> 1472.38]  груsting the praise of you and to drip on our hearts.
[1472.38 --> 1473.58]  We sing them these last two songs.
[1474.76 --> 1477.30]  Let's sing them these
[1477.70 --> 1494.70] nimschines Sunset
[1494.70 --> 1511.26]  Holy Spirit, ring down, ring down
[1511.26 --> 1517.18]  O comforter and friend
[1517.18 --> 1523.50]  How we need your touch again
[1523.50 --> 1536.42]  Holy Spirit, ring down, ring down
[1536.42 --> 1543.36]  Let your power fall, let your voice be heard
[1543.36 --> 1549.78]  Come and change our hearts as we stand on your word
[1549.78 --> 1562.70]  Holy Spirit, ring down, ring down
[1562.70 --> 1575.62]  Holy Spirit, ring down, ring down
[1575.62 --> 1580.62]  O comforter and friend
[1580.62 --> 1585.62]  How we need your touch again
[1585.62 --> 1588.54]  Holy Spirit, ring down, ring down
[1588.54 --> 1601.46]  Let your power fall, let your voice be heard
[1601.46 --> 1604.46]  Let your voice be heard
[1604.46 --> 1607.46]  Come and change our hearts as we stand on your word
[1607.46 --> 1620.38]  Holy Spirit, ring down
[1620.38 --> 1630.30]  No eye has seen, no ear has heard
[1630.30 --> 1635.30]  No mind can know what God has in store
[1635.30 --> 1642.36]  So open up heaven, open and wide
[1642.36 --> 1649.36]  Over your church and over our lives
[1649.36 --> 1655.28]  Holy Spirit, ring down, ring down
[1655.28 --> 1667.28]  Ring down, oh comforter and friend
[1667.28 --> 1669.28]  How we need your touch again
[1669.28 --> 1673.28]  How we need your touch again
[1673.28 --> 1680.20]  Holy Spirit, ring down, ring down
[1680.20 --> 1685.20]  Ring down, let your power fall
[1685.20 --> 1692.12]  Let your power fall, let your voice be heard
[1692.12 --> 1699.12]  Come and change our hearts as we stand on your word
[1699.12 --> 1701.12]  Holy Spirit, ring down
[1701.12 --> 1706.12]  Holy Spirit, ring down
[1706.12 --> 1710.12]  Holy Spirit, ring down
[1710.12 --> 1722.12]  We'll sing this next song as a prayer as we go into our service
[1722.12 --> 1737.12]  Spirit of the living God
[1737.12 --> 1743.12]  Fall afresh on me
[1743.12 --> 1750.12]  Spirit of the living God
[1750.12 --> 1755.12]  Fall afresh on me
[1755.12 --> 1763.12]  Melt me, mold me
[1763.12 --> 1770.12]  Fill me, use me
[1770.12 --> 1775.12]  Spirit of the living God
[1775.12 --> 1777.12]  Spirit of the living God
[1777.12 --> 1782.12]  Fall afresh on me
[1782.12 --> 1786.12]  Spirit of the living God
[1786.12 --> 1790.12]  Spirit of the living God
[1790.12 --> 1796.12]  Move among us all
[1796.12 --> 1802.12]  Make us fall in heart and mind
[1802.12 --> 1805.12]  Make us fall in love
[1805.12 --> 1809.12]  Make us fall in love
[1809.12 --> 1812.12]  Humble, caring, selfless sharing
[1812.12 --> 1817.12]  Humble, caring, selfless sharing
[1817.12 --> 1828.12]  Spirit of the living God
[1828.12 --> 1830.12]  Fill our lives with love
[1830.12 --> 1836.12]  You may have a seat
[1836.12 --> 1853.12]  Is there a deacon coming up for the offering announcement?
[1853.12 --> 1856.12]  This
[1856.12 --> 1863.12]  Is the offering for night shift?
[1863.12 --> 1868.12]  Night shift?
[1868.12 --> 1872.12]  Night shift is a ministry that
[1872.12 --> 1875.12]  Oh, it's C10
[1875.12 --> 1876.12]  Then I don't know
[1876.12 --> 1879.12]  C10
[1879.12 --> 1882.12]  The offerings today are for the church budget
[1882.12 --> 1885.12]  And then the second one is for C10
[1885.12 --> 1889.12]  C10 is the ministry organization that my sister Jodi and her husband Uriel
[1889.12 --> 1893.12]  Are associated with in Mexico
[1893.12 --> 1895.12]  And so the money is used
[1895.12 --> 1898.12]  Go to help their ministry
[1898.12 --> 1900.12]  Please give generously
[1900.12 --> 1904.12]  Next week's offering is for night shift ministries
[1904.12 --> 1906.12]  To be continued
[1906.12 --> 1907.12]  To be continued
[1907.12 --> 1908.12]  To be continued
[1908.12 --> 1909.12]  To be continued
[1909.12 --> 1911.12]  To be continued
[1911.12 --> 1912.12]  To be continued
[1912.12 --> 1914.12]  To be continued

[1921.12 --> 1923.12]  To be continued
[1923.12 --> 1953.12] 
[1953.12 --> 1957.20]  No place I'd rather be
[1957.20 --> 1961.48]  No place I'd rather be
[1961.48 --> 1965.40]  No place I'd rather be
[1965.40 --> 1969.84]  Than here in your love, here in your love
[1969.84 --> 1974.08]  To set a fire down in my soul
[1974.08 --> 1978.04]  That I can't contain, that I can't control
[1978.04 --> 1981.82]  I want more of you above
[1981.82 --> 1986.04]  I want more of you above
[1986.04 --> 1989.88]  To set a fire down in my soul
[1989.88 --> 1993.88]  That I can't contain, that I can't control
[1993.88 --> 1997.46]  I want more of you above
[1997.46 --> 2001.42]  I want more of you above
[2011.82 --> 2019.88]  No place I'd rather be
[2019.88 --> 2023.88]  No place I'd rather be
[2023.88 --> 2027.88]  No place I'd rather be
[2027.88 --> 2031.88]  Than here in your love, here in your love
[2031.88 --> 2037.10]  To set a fire down in my soul
[2037.10 --> 2041.94]  That I can't contain, that I can't control
[2041.94 --> 2045.94]  I want more of you above
[2045.94 --> 2050.10]  I want more of you above
[2050.10 --> 2052.94]  To set a fire down in my soul
[2052.94 --> 2057.16]  That I can't contain, that I can't control
[2057.16 --> 2061.38]  I want more of you above
[2061.38 --> 2065.60]  I want more of you above
[2065.60 --> 2093.58]  Good morning
[2093.58 --> 2095.66]  Can I have all the kids
[2095.66 --> 2097.44]  I think age 3 to grade 4
[2097.44 --> 2099.68]  We'll do a little chat
[2099.68 --> 2101.14]  And then we'll have the children's blessing
[2101.14 --> 2107.88]  Lots of you guys today
[2107.88 --> 2111.76]  Here we are into June, right?
[2111.84 --> 2115.56]  We're getting close to the end of the Sunday school time
[2115.56 --> 2116.64]  Children's worship time
[2116.64 --> 2122.24]  Ooh, summer school
[2122.24 --> 2124.68]  Yeah, that could be exciting
[2124.68 --> 2127.34]  Hey, have I asked you guys this before?
[2127.72 --> 2130.14]  Have I asked you guys what your favorite animal is?
[2130.62 --> 2131.96]  I feel like I did ask this
[2131.96 --> 2134.24]  Can you guys remind me what some of your favorite animals are?
[2134.78 --> 2136.16]  A bunny, good one
[2136.16 --> 2138.28]  A kitty, oh nice
[2138.28 --> 2139.12]  You're scared
[2139.12 --> 2142.68]  A cheetah, good one
[2142.68 --> 2144.84]  A red panda
[2144.84 --> 2145.34]  Okay
[2145.34 --> 2146.04]  We're getting
[2146.04 --> 2148.44]  Your dad would agree
[2148.44 --> 2148.76]  Yeah
[2148.76 --> 2152.08]  Fishies, all the fishies
[2152.08 --> 2153.08]  What about you, Zoe?
[2156.02 --> 2156.98]  Snow bunnies
[2156.98 --> 2158.04]  I didn't know that existed
[2158.04 --> 2162.76]  Panthers?
[2163.28 --> 2164.44]  You guys have some good ones
[2164.44 --> 2165.22]  Well, I'm going to
[2165.22 --> 2165.84]  Oh, what's yours?
[2166.64 --> 2167.24]  A panda
[2167.24 --> 2168.18]  You guys have some good ones
[2168.18 --> 2169.08]  I'm going to pull a little
[2169.08 --> 2170.76]  One of my favorite animals
[2170.76 --> 2173.94]  This wee little toy that I brought here
[2173.94 --> 2175.66]  That I've had since I was
[2175.66 --> 2178.64]  So, it's a lion
[2178.64 --> 2181.86]  Yes, it's one of my favorite animals
[2181.86 --> 2183.62]  Do you guys know lots about lions?
[2184.54 --> 2184.78]  Yeah?
[2185.06 --> 2185.94]  Give me some facts
[2185.94 --> 2187.52]  What do you know about lions?
[2188.04 --> 2189.40]  They have a mane
[2189.40 --> 2190.00]  Good one
[2190.00 --> 2192.56]  They eat meat
[2192.56 --> 2198.22]  Oh, but only the boy lions have maines
[2198.22 --> 2199.14]  Yeah, that's
[2199.14 --> 2199.78]  No, the girls
[2199.78 --> 2200.40]  No, no, no
[2200.40 --> 2201.12]  Too much hair
[2201.12 --> 2203.58]  They roar
[2203.58 --> 2204.96]  You guys have some great facts
[2204.96 --> 2207.24]  They live in caves?
[2207.44 --> 2207.62]  Oh
[2207.62 --> 2210.62]  They can purr
[2210.62 --> 2211.12]  That's right
[2211.12 --> 2212.66]  Because they're just a giant cat
[2212.66 --> 2217.40]  The females do the hunting
[2217.40 --> 2218.26]  Not the males
[2218.26 --> 2219.42]  That's the way to live
[2219.42 --> 2219.64]  Hey?
[2222.08 --> 2223.74]  You can see them at the zoo
[2223.74 --> 2224.44]  Yeah
[2224.44 --> 2226.10]  What's that?
[2227.20 --> 2228.72]  They're a fat cat
[2228.72 --> 2230.92]  They're big and lazy sometimes
[2230.92 --> 2231.92]  Lions?
[2231.92 --> 2233.82]  Oh man, those are lots of cool facts about lions
[2233.82 --> 2237.34]  The lion is mentioned in the Bible quite a bit
[2237.34 --> 2239.06]  There's a few places
[2239.06 --> 2241.34]  There's a few really good stories with lions in them
[2241.34 --> 2244.58]  And we already kind of talked about Pentecost
[2244.58 --> 2246.90]  At Sunday school, at children's worship time
[2246.90 --> 2247.70]  A couple weeks ago
[2247.70 --> 2251.00]  So today we're going back to an older story we skipped
[2251.00 --> 2252.92]  And that one involves lions
[2252.92 --> 2253.74]  Lions
[2253.74 --> 2255.36]  Do you think lions would make a good pet?
[2256.32 --> 2256.76]  No
[2256.76 --> 2257.52]  No?
[2257.66 --> 2257.96]  Would you
[2257.96 --> 2258.78]  No?
[2259.18 --> 2262.02]  Would you like to have a lion sleeping in your bedroom with you?
[2262.64 --> 2263.06]  Yes?
[2263.20 --> 2263.50]  Okay
[2263.50 --> 2264.20]  All right
[2264.20 --> 2264.52]  Well
[2264.52 --> 2268.28]  It is a wild animal in many cases for sure
[2268.28 --> 2269.78]  Well we're going to talk about someone
[2269.78 --> 2271.48]  They could purr
[2271.48 --> 2271.70]  Yeah
[2271.70 --> 2275.34]  We're going to talk about someone who had to sleep with a bunch of lions
[2275.34 --> 2277.74]  And how that went
[2277.74 --> 2278.60]  Yeah
[2278.60 --> 2280.76]  Well let's go talk about that story
[2280.76 --> 2281.98]  But first we'll do the blessing
[2281.98 --> 2283.00]  And then we'll head off
[2283.00 --> 2284.38]  Just children's worship time
[2284.38 --> 2286.52]  Let's stand together
[2286.52 --> 2290.44]  Okay ready?
[2292.58 --> 2293.06]  Forward
[2293.06 --> 2293.58]  Forward
[2308.60 --> 2322.94]  Good morning
[2322.94 --> 2324.30]  My name is Ken
[2324.30 --> 2326.42]  I'm an elder here at Emanuel Christian Form Church
[2326.42 --> 2329.32]  And today I'll be leading us in our church family prayer
[2329.32 --> 2331.16]  Before we come to our Lord in Prayer
[2331.16 --> 2333.96]  I just want to take a moment to remind us all that next Sunday
[2333.96 --> 2335.72]  We will be celebrating the Lord's Supper
[2335.72 --> 2338.48]  And so I encourage all of us to take some time this week
[2338.48 --> 2341.52]  To prepare our hearts for the communion table
[2341.52 --> 2344.44]  And also to speak with our children and our families
[2344.44 --> 2346.04]  About what it means
[2346.04 --> 2348.78]  And the blessing that we have to gather around the table
[2348.78 --> 2353.30]  And commemorate our Lord's saving grace in our lives
[2353.30 --> 2356.82]  So let's now bow our heads in prayer
[2356.82 --> 2359.62]  Our Lord and our God
[2359.62 --> 2362.62]  As we have gathered today on this Pentecost Sunday
[2362.62 --> 2366.14]  There is truly no place we would rather be than here
[2366.14 --> 2367.42]  In your love
[2367.42 --> 2370.10]  Lord we're filled with awe and wonder
[2370.10 --> 2372.50]  At the presence and the works of your Holy Spirit
[2372.50 --> 2374.76]  Here in this moment and throughout our lives
[2374.76 --> 2377.10]  And through our lives towards others
[2377.10 --> 2380.82]  Father thank you for sending your spirit in Jesus' name
[2380.82 --> 2383.46]  Holy Spirit stir in our hearts
[2383.46 --> 2385.58]  To give us boldness to proclaim the gospel
[2385.58 --> 2388.12]  To a world that so desperately needs it
[2388.12 --> 2391.16]  We see the war in Ukraine continue
[2391.16 --> 2393.34]  As well as wars in other parts of the world
[2393.34 --> 2394.48]  And we confess Lord
[2394.48 --> 2396.84]  That we often become desensitized
[2396.84 --> 2399.36]  And even complacent to these situations over time
[2399.36 --> 2402.60]  Holy Spirit remove complacency from our hearts
[2402.60 --> 2405.82]  We pray that you will bring an end to the suffering
[2405.82 --> 2407.66]  And pain caused by these wars
[2407.66 --> 2411.30]  We also pray for all those who are grieving
[2411.30 --> 2413.70]  The acts of violence and senseless shootings
[2413.70 --> 2415.02]  That have taken place recently
[2415.02 --> 2418.06]  There's so much pain and brokenness in this world
[2418.06 --> 2420.48]  Lord we ask for comfort and healing
[2420.48 --> 2423.20]  For all whose lives have been shattered by these shootings
[2423.20 --> 2427.02]  Lord we also lift up all those in our congregation
[2427.02 --> 2428.82]  Who grieve the loss of loved ones
[2428.82 --> 2431.24]  We think of Leslie and Paul Kuhl
[2431.24 --> 2433.60]  With the passing of Leslie's dad Bill Potma
[2433.60 --> 2436.28]  And we also pray for Carolyn and Glenn Nort
[2436.28 --> 2438.38]  With Carolyn's dad's passing
[2438.38 --> 2440.22]  Pastor John Van Hemert
[2440.22 --> 2443.36]  We also pray for those of us
[2443.36 --> 2445.26]  Who have lost loved ones earlier this year
[2445.26 --> 2446.48]  Or even in years past
[2446.48 --> 2447.72]  And continue to miss them
[2447.72 --> 2450.64]  Bring us all comfort and peace Lord
[2450.64 --> 2455.00]  We continue to uphold the Rezabos family in prayer
[2455.00 --> 2457.92]  As Louise continues to receive care in the hospital
[2457.92 --> 2461.20]  We're thankful to hear that the feeding tube has been removed
[2461.20 --> 2463.26]  But we know there is still much uncertainty
[2463.26 --> 2465.14]  And time of waiting for the family
[2465.14 --> 2468.10]  Holy Spirit we ask for full healing for Louise
[2468.10 --> 2471.04]  And that you would provide strength for the whole family
[2471.04 --> 2474.60]  We pray for everyone in our church
[2474.60 --> 2476.04]  And outside our church
[2476.04 --> 2477.64]  Who are struggling with relationships
[2477.64 --> 2479.06]  That have become strained
[2479.06 --> 2482.56]  Lord work in our hearts to guide us towards grace
[2482.56 --> 2485.08]  With the grace we have received in Christ
[2485.08 --> 2488.46]  We love because you first loved us
[2488.46 --> 2490.20]  And we live because you live
[2490.20 --> 2492.66]  Thank you Lord for giving us your love
[2492.66 --> 2494.16]  And for giving us life
[2494.16 --> 2498.08]  Holy Spirit breathe words of life into us
[2498.08 --> 2501.42]  Even when we are hurt by those who are nearest to us
[2501.42 --> 2504.80]  Lord we pray for our church denomination
[2504.80 --> 2507.60]  And for the synod meetings that will take place
[2507.60 --> 2509.96]  Starting this Friday and continuing on for a week
[2509.96 --> 2512.32]  Lord please bless the discussions
[2512.32 --> 2514.54]  And we ask that you guide and direct your church
[2514.54 --> 2515.32]  Through these meetings
[2515.32 --> 2519.00]  Thank you Lord for providing leadership for the church
[2519.00 --> 2521.66]  Through the delegates who will participate in the synod
[2521.66 --> 2525.54]  Lord we thank you for your church body here at Emmanuel
[2525.54 --> 2528.00]  We praise you and thank you for the staff
[2528.00 --> 2528.88]  Volunteers
[2528.88 --> 2529.40]  Leaders
[2529.40 --> 2532.38]  And participants in each of the ministries here
[2532.38 --> 2535.50]  Holy Spirit we ask that you work through us
[2535.50 --> 2537.70]  To grow your kingdom through our church
[2537.70 --> 2540.34]  We pray that you prepare our hearts
[2540.34 --> 2542.90]  As we plan to gather next week around your table
[2542.90 --> 2544.56]  And participate in communion
[2544.56 --> 2547.64]  And now Lord we ask that you speak to us
[2547.64 --> 2549.68]  Through the words of your servant Pastor Chris
[2549.68 --> 2553.34]  And that our lives may be transformed by your gospel
[2553.34 --> 2555.84]  We pray all this in Jesus name
[2555.84 --> 2556.68]  Amen
[2574.56 --> 2580.08]  As we're getting ready to open God's word
[2580.08 --> 2582.84]  I was just struck as Ken was praying
[2582.84 --> 2588.20]  And as the worship team adapted so quickly to a strange circumstance
[2588.20 --> 2593.30]  We are really dependent on our volunteers here at this church
[2593.30 --> 2594.88]  And we have amazing volunteers
[2594.88 --> 2598.12]  That's when someone says amen and applauds
[2598.12 --> 2600.64]  Yeah there you go
[2600.64 --> 2608.04]  And so I just want to plug an event that we have coming up on June 18
[2608.04 --> 2610.88]  It's called an all leaders lunch
[2610.88 --> 2615.68]  But that's available to anyone who volunteers here in any capacity
[2615.68 --> 2618.68]  We just want to thank you for the work that you do in our church
[2618.68 --> 2620.52]  Making our mission and ministry possible
[2620.52 --> 2624.98]  And encourage you with some fellowship and a light lunch
[2624.98 --> 2628.42]  And then do some training and equipping there as well
[2628.42 --> 2631.80]  So you maybe have seen in the e-bulletin
[2631.80 --> 2633.36]  There's a link to sign up for that
[2633.36 --> 2634.94]  If you don't receive the e-bulletin
[2634.94 --> 2638.08]  You can go to our church website on the event page
[2638.08 --> 2640.90]  Find the event for June 18
[2640.90 --> 2644.42]  But I want to encourage everyone who volunteers in any capacity
[2644.42 --> 2647.26]  To sign up for that event
[2647.26 --> 2654.26]  With that said we're going to spend some time here in God's word
[2654.26 --> 2657.62]  And Enoch, I apologize for this
[2657.62 --> 2659.96]  But I'm going to shoot from the hip for a moment here
[2659.96 --> 2664.04]  And those of you who know me all of a sudden got scared
[2664.04 --> 2670.00]  But I'm going to read for us from Philippians 2
[2670.00 --> 2673.96]  But then I also want to read from Acts 2
[2673.96 --> 2679.84]  As we ground ourselves on Pentecost Sunday
[2679.84 --> 2686.10]  With the work of the Spirit to shape us and to transform our lives
[2686.10 --> 2688.38]  And in fact, I'm going to start in Acts
[2688.38 --> 2692.28]  And so Acts 2, which isn't going to be on the screen
[2692.28 --> 2694.58]  Because this is a change
[2694.58 --> 2699.30]  Acts 2, we're going to start at verse 42
[2699.30 --> 2701.14]  And just read to the end of the chapter
[2701.14 --> 2705.20]  And then after that, we'll flip to Philippians 2
[2705.20 --> 2711.58]  Luke writes that they
[2711.58 --> 2713.96]  That is the early Christian church
[2713.96 --> 2717.66]  Those people who were first converted on Pentecost
[2717.66 --> 2720.88]  And believing Jews from before them
[2720.88 --> 2724.60]  They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching
[2724.60 --> 2726.02]  And to fellowship
[2726.02 --> 2727.78]  To the breaking of bread
[2727.78 --> 2728.94]  And to prayer
[2728.94 --> 2733.20]  Everyone was filled with awe
[2733.20 --> 2734.84]  At many wonders and signs
[2734.84 --> 2736.10]  Performed by the apostles
[2736.10 --> 2738.74]  All the believers were together
[2738.74 --> 2740.38]  And had everything in common
[2740.38 --> 2742.28]  They sold property and possessions
[2742.28 --> 2744.12]  To give to anyone who has need
[2744.12 --> 2747.08]  Every day they continued to meet together
[2747.08 --> 2748.00]  In the temple courts
[2748.00 --> 2749.64]  They broke bread in their homes
[2749.64 --> 2751.90]  And ate together with glad and sincere hearts
[2751.90 --> 2754.40]  Praising God and enjoying the favor
[2754.40 --> 2755.36]  Of all the people
[2755.36 --> 2758.38]  And the Lord added to their number daily
[2758.38 --> 2760.48]  Those who were being saved
[2760.48 --> 2763.52]  Now on Pentecost Sunday
[2763.52 --> 2765.18]  And as we are beginning a series
[2765.18 --> 2767.94]  Into holy habits
[2767.94 --> 2769.40]  I want you to know
[2769.40 --> 2771.62]  That every habit we recommend to you
[2771.62 --> 2772.82]  Over these next few weeks
[2772.82 --> 2774.80]  Is grounded in this text from Acts 2
[2774.80 --> 2777.14]  And what the early church did
[2777.14 --> 2778.58]  In response to the work of the Spirit
[2778.58 --> 2780.48]  And to the forming of their community
[2780.48 --> 2782.40]  So that is our foundation
[2782.40 --> 2783.42]  For recommending
[2783.42 --> 2784.38]  For commending
[2784.38 --> 2785.30]  For encouraging
[2785.30 --> 2786.98]  These holy habits
[2786.98 --> 2788.00]  To you
[2788.00 --> 2789.70]  And if that is the
[2789.70 --> 2791.24]  Foundation for encouraging
[2791.24 --> 2793.74]  Next from Philippians 2
[2793.74 --> 2794.88]  Is the motivation
[2794.88 --> 2796.64]  For encouraging
[2796.64 --> 2797.78]  So Philippians 2
[2797.78 --> 2800.24]  Verse 12 and 13
[2800.24 --> 2803.02]  Therefore
[2803.02 --> 2804.72]  My dear friends
[2804.72 --> 2807.06]  As you have always obeyed
[2807.06 --> 2808.60]  Not only in my presence
[2808.60 --> 2810.46]  But now much more in my absence
[2810.46 --> 2813.14]  Continue to work out your salvation
[2813.14 --> 2814.96]  With fear and trembling
[2814.96 --> 2818.06]  For it is God who works in you
[2818.06 --> 2819.54]  To will and to act
[2819.54 --> 2820.90]  In order to fulfill
[2820.90 --> 2823.44]  His good purpose
[2823.44 --> 2825.26]  This is the word of the Lord
[2825.26 --> 2833.56]  It seems to me
[2833.56 --> 2835.48]  That recently
[2835.48 --> 2837.28]  God has
[2837.28 --> 2839.96]  Laid in front of my path
[2839.96 --> 2842.26]  My life of faith
[2842.26 --> 2844.72]  Many opportunities
[2844.72 --> 2846.54]  More than is seemingly ordinary
[2846.54 --> 2847.92]  Which might surprise you
[2847.92 --> 2848.96]  Considering that I'm a pastor
[2848.96 --> 2850.46]  But many opportunities
[2850.46 --> 2853.20]  To talk to people about faith
[2853.20 --> 2855.98]  Explicitly about faith
[2855.98 --> 2857.10]  What is faith?
[2857.18 --> 2858.78]  What does it mean to have faith?
[2858.86 --> 2860.06]  What does it mean to experience
[2860.06 --> 2861.80]  Or to feel faith?
[2861.92 --> 2864.44]  And how do we find faith?
[2865.44 --> 2866.78]  And what's been fascinating
[2866.78 --> 2868.58]  Is this has been happening
[2868.58 --> 2869.28]  In my life
[2869.28 --> 2869.48]  It's
[2869.48 --> 2871.46]  The conversations have been
[2871.46 --> 2873.18]  Spanning the age
[2873.18 --> 2874.20]  And demographic range
[2874.20 --> 2874.84]  I've been talking to
[2874.84 --> 2876.72]  High school kids
[2876.72 --> 2878.08]  20-somethings
[2878.08 --> 2879.74]  And people in their 60s
[2879.74 --> 2880.86]  And 70s
[2880.86 --> 2881.72]  And maybe older
[2881.72 --> 2882.96]  I won't wager to guess
[2882.96 --> 2883.58]  How old they are
[2883.58 --> 2886.52]  And as we've had
[2886.52 --> 2887.50]  These conversations
[2887.50 --> 2888.90]  Right
[2888.90 --> 2889.52]  We're not just
[2889.52 --> 2891.82]  Talking about any faith
[2891.82 --> 2892.70]  But specifically
[2892.70 --> 2893.18]  Of course
[2893.18 --> 2894.14]  Christian faith
[2894.14 --> 2894.80]  Our
[2894.80 --> 2896.20]  Shared faith
[2896.20 --> 2896.62]  Here
[2896.62 --> 2897.14]  Right
[2897.14 --> 2898.56]  In the midst of chaos
[2898.56 --> 2899.88]  And turmoil
[2899.88 --> 2901.16]  In the midst of doubt
[2901.16 --> 2902.04]  And trial
[2902.04 --> 2902.80]  In the midst of
[2902.80 --> 2903.78]  So many things
[2903.78 --> 2904.36]  That are happening
[2904.36 --> 2905.40]  That are challenging
[2905.40 --> 2906.82]  To our faith
[2906.82 --> 2907.74]  In the midst of
[2907.74 --> 2908.62]  Our obediences
[2908.62 --> 2910.66]  And our disobediences
[2910.66 --> 2912.18]  How do we
[2912.18 --> 2914.04]  Have faith
[2914.04 --> 2916.88]  And of course
[2916.88 --> 2917.56]  This isn't always
[2917.56 --> 2919.02]  A straightforward answer
[2919.02 --> 2921.04]  Right
[2921.04 --> 2922.28]  Your contexts
[2922.28 --> 2923.48]  Change
[2923.48 --> 2924.40]  Your circumstance
[2924.40 --> 2925.44]  Is going to be different
[2925.44 --> 2927.06]  Than the next person
[2927.06 --> 2927.90]  Your experience
[2927.90 --> 2928.68]  Is going to be different
[2928.68 --> 2929.22]  Than the person
[2929.22 --> 2930.24]  Beside you
[2930.24 --> 2931.46]  And so
[2931.46 --> 2932.42]  How you come
[2932.42 --> 2933.30]  To understand
[2933.30 --> 2934.16]  Or experience
[2934.16 --> 2934.52]  Faith
[2934.52 --> 2935.66]  In the midst
[2935.66 --> 2936.20]  Of whatever
[2936.20 --> 2937.00]  Is going on
[2937.00 --> 2937.66]  Is also
[2937.66 --> 2938.62]  Going to have
[2938.62 --> 2939.78]  Its own hue
[2939.78 --> 2940.76]  Is going to be
[2940.76 --> 2941.66]  Different
[2941.66 --> 2943.94]  And to complicate
[2943.94 --> 2944.92]  Things a little bit
[2944.92 --> 2945.92]  Even that word
[2945.92 --> 2946.52]  Faith
[2946.52 --> 2948.30]  Right
[2948.30 --> 2949.36]  Has multiple
[2949.36 --> 2950.08]  Meanings
[2950.08 --> 2951.74]  Both in English
[2951.74 --> 2952.80]  And as it's used
[2952.80 --> 2953.68]  In the Bible
[2953.68 --> 2954.98]  Right
[2954.98 --> 2956.26]  The word faith
[2956.26 --> 2958.38]  Is used to convey
[2958.38 --> 2959.78]  A bunch of different ideas
[2959.78 --> 2961.14]  For instance
[2961.14 --> 2962.14]  You might say
[2962.14 --> 2963.20]  About someone
[2963.20 --> 2964.92]  I have faith in her
[2964.92 --> 2966.28]  Right
[2966.28 --> 2967.04]  And what we mean
[2967.04 --> 2967.74]  When we say that
[2967.74 --> 2968.92]  Is that we trust them
[2968.92 --> 2969.48]  And we know
[2969.48 --> 2971.06]  That she is able
[2971.06 --> 2972.64]  Or she is capable
[2972.64 --> 2973.74]  To do it
[2973.74 --> 2975.42]  Or we might say
[2975.42 --> 2976.40]  Something like
[2976.40 --> 2977.82]  I have faith
[2977.82 --> 2978.98]  That my experiment
[2978.98 --> 2980.68]  Will prove my hypothesis
[2980.68 --> 2982.00]  Right
[2982.00 --> 2982.94]  In which case
[2982.94 --> 2984.42]  Faith is used
[2984.42 --> 2985.82]  As a statement
[2985.82 --> 2987.70]  Of something unproven
[2987.70 --> 2990.04]  And we also use faith
[2990.04 --> 2990.80]  As a noun
[2990.80 --> 2991.92]  Right
[2991.92 --> 2992.64]  You might say
[2992.64 --> 2993.88]  She and I share
[2993.88 --> 2994.76]  A faith
[2994.76 --> 2995.90]  In which case
[2995.90 --> 2996.28]  Of course
[2996.28 --> 2997.64]  We're referring to
[2997.64 --> 2999.80]  A religious system
[2999.80 --> 3000.90]  Or a set of ideas
[3000.90 --> 3001.72]  And doctrines
[3001.72 --> 3002.48]  And commitments
[3002.48 --> 3004.00]  Now
[3004.00 --> 3005.32]  We also
[3005.32 --> 3007.12]  Use faith
[3007.12 --> 3008.68]  In phrases like
[3008.68 --> 3009.74]  Keep the faith
[3009.74 --> 3011.44]  Or break faith
[3011.44 --> 3013.04]  In which case
[3013.04 --> 3013.68]  That means
[3013.68 --> 3014.78]  Faith is understood
[3014.78 --> 3015.58]  As loyalty
[3015.58 --> 3016.86]  To someone
[3016.86 --> 3017.94]  Or to something
[3017.94 --> 3019.26]  And
[3019.26 --> 3020.64]  Maybe you've heard it
[3020.64 --> 3021.46]  This is more
[3021.46 --> 3022.86]  In legal settings
[3022.86 --> 3024.40]  But you hear the phrase
[3024.40 --> 3025.34]  Good faith
[3025.34 --> 3026.60]  Or bad faith
[3026.60 --> 3027.02]  Right
[3027.02 --> 3027.88]  They operated in
[3027.88 --> 3028.80]  Good faith
[3028.80 --> 3029.50]  In which case
[3029.50 --> 3030.84]  Faith refers to
[3030.84 --> 3031.64]  A kind of
[3031.64 --> 3032.64]  Intentionality
[3032.64 --> 3035.30]  And then
[3035.30 --> 3036.32]  To complicate matters
[3036.32 --> 3037.82]  Is faith and belief
[3037.82 --> 3038.46]  The same thing
[3038.46 --> 3041.64]  And further
[3041.64 --> 3042.58]  To complicate
[3042.58 --> 3043.30]  Even more
[3043.30 --> 3043.78]  In the
[3043.78 --> 3044.66]  Sort of broader
[3044.66 --> 3046.68]  Evangelical world
[3046.68 --> 3047.12]  Right
[3047.12 --> 3048.18]  We also talk about
[3048.18 --> 3049.54]  Saving faith
[3049.54 --> 3051.16]  Right
[3051.16 --> 3052.40]  I don't know
[3052.40 --> 3053.34]  Ordinary faith
[3053.34 --> 3054.76]  What's contrasting
[3054.76 --> 3055.46]  From saving faith
[3055.46 --> 3055.84]  Or are they
[3055.84 --> 3056.38]  The same thing
[3056.38 --> 3058.96]  Is faith a feeling
[3058.96 --> 3060.98]  Is it something more
[3060.98 --> 3062.32]  Is it something less
[3062.32 --> 3063.40]  Is faith an action
[3063.40 --> 3064.54]  Is faith knowledge
[3064.54 --> 3065.32]  Is it belief
[3065.32 --> 3066.38]  Is it right knowledge
[3066.38 --> 3067.72]  Or right belief
[3067.72 --> 3069.76]  What is faith
[3069.76 --> 3069.78]  What is faith
[3069.78 --> 3071.92]  Now
[3071.92 --> 3075.06]  Some of you here
[3075.06 --> 3076.50]  This morning
[3076.50 --> 3078.58]  Particularly
[3078.58 --> 3079.46]  Those of you
[3079.46 --> 3080.24]  Who you know
[3080.24 --> 3081.40]  Are really keen
[3081.40 --> 3081.92]  And you know
[3081.92 --> 3082.42]  Your Bibles
[3082.42 --> 3083.10]  Really well
[3083.10 --> 3084.36]  When you hear me
[3084.36 --> 3085.08]  Ask the question
[3085.08 --> 3085.86]  What is faith
[3085.86 --> 3086.92]  You immediately
[3086.92 --> 3087.80]  Think of Hebrews
[3087.80 --> 3088.84]  11 verse 1
[3088.84 --> 3090.12]  Right
[3090.12 --> 3090.72]  Now faith
[3090.72 --> 3091.70]  Is being sure
[3091.70 --> 3093.00]  Of what you hope
[3093.00 --> 3094.10]  For and certain
[3094.10 --> 3094.96]  Of what you do
[3094.96 --> 3095.58]  Not see
[3095.58 --> 3097.98]  And if that's
[3097.98 --> 3098.58]  Where your mind
[3098.58 --> 3098.96]  Went
[3098.96 --> 3099.70]  Right
[3099.70 --> 3100.30]  You would
[3100.30 --> 3100.74]  Of course
[3100.74 --> 3101.16]  Be right
[3101.16 --> 3101.80]  Because we're not
[3101.80 --> 3102.14]  Going to argue
[3102.14 --> 3103.06]  With what scripture
[3103.06 --> 3103.44]  Says
[3103.44 --> 3103.98]  Right
[3103.98 --> 3104.74]  Faith is being
[3104.74 --> 3105.68]  Sure of hope
[3105.68 --> 3106.66]  And certain
[3106.66 --> 3107.52]  Of the unseen
[3107.52 --> 3110.44]  In many ways
[3110.44 --> 3110.92]  Right
[3110.92 --> 3112.66]  This understanding
[3112.66 --> 3113.54]  Of faith
[3113.54 --> 3115.20]  Is like a
[3115.20 --> 3115.94]  Decision
[3115.94 --> 3117.66]  Right
[3117.66 --> 3118.70]  You have said
[3118.70 --> 3120.00]  In this moment
[3120.00 --> 3121.22]  In face of the uncertain
[3121.22 --> 3121.98]  And the unseen
[3121.98 --> 3123.06]  I will have hope
[3123.06 --> 3124.82]  I will be convicted
[3124.82 --> 3126.28]  I will be sure
[3126.28 --> 3128.16]  And then
[3128.16 --> 3128.84]  What happens
[3128.84 --> 3129.52]  In the rest
[3129.52 --> 3130.54]  Of Hebrews 11
[3130.54 --> 3131.22]  For those of you
[3131.22 --> 3132.02]  Who are wondering
[3132.02 --> 3132.64]  Is you get this
[3132.64 --> 3133.40]  Long list
[3133.40 --> 3134.56]  Of the heroes
[3134.56 --> 3135.38]  Of faith
[3135.38 --> 3136.32]  Right
[3136.32 --> 3136.96]  People who were
[3136.96 --> 3137.76]  Commended
[3137.76 --> 3139.34]  For their faith
[3139.34 --> 3139.74]  And so
[3139.74 --> 3140.48]  It reads
[3140.48 --> 3141.62]  By faith
[3141.62 --> 3142.28]  Abel
[3142.28 --> 3143.20]  Offered a better
[3143.20 --> 3143.92]  Sacrifice
[3143.92 --> 3144.92]  By faith
[3144.92 --> 3145.40]  Noah
[3145.40 --> 3146.56]  Built the ark
[3146.56 --> 3147.64]  To save his family
[3147.64 --> 3148.56]  By faith
[3148.56 --> 3149.18]  Abraham
[3149.18 --> 3149.98]  When called to
[3149.98 --> 3150.46]  Obey
[3150.46 --> 3151.68]  Or when called to go
[3151.68 --> 3152.90]  Obeyed and went
[3152.90 --> 3153.54]  Even though he
[3153.54 --> 3154.00]  Didn't know
[3154.00 --> 3154.84]  Where he was going
[3154.84 --> 3155.66]  And then on
[3155.66 --> 3156.42]  And on it goes
[3156.42 --> 3157.16]  Through the
[3157.16 --> 3158.88]  Heroes of faith
[3158.88 --> 3159.94]  Isaac and Jacob
[3159.94 --> 3160.48]  And Joseph
[3160.48 --> 3161.16]  By faith
[3161.16 --> 3162.16]  Moses chose
[3162.16 --> 3162.98]  To be mistreated
[3162.98 --> 3163.68]  Along with the
[3163.68 --> 3164.42]  People of God
[3164.42 --> 3165.42]  By faith
[3165.42 --> 3166.18]  The prostitute
[3166.18 --> 3166.68]  Rahab
[3166.68 --> 3167.26]  Because she
[3167.26 --> 3168.08]  Welcomed spies
[3168.08 --> 3169.40]  Was not killed
[3169.40 --> 3171.42]  And so according
[3171.42 --> 3172.28]  To Hebrews 11
[3172.28 --> 3172.76]  When we take
[3172.76 --> 3173.48]  Both the statement
[3173.48 --> 3174.80]  And the expression
[3174.80 --> 3175.36]  Of it
[3175.36 --> 3175.78]  Right
[3175.78 --> 3176.48]  Faith is a
[3176.48 --> 3177.10]  Commitment
[3177.10 --> 3178.00]  And a decision
[3178.00 --> 3179.36]  To be a certain
[3179.36 --> 3179.72]  Way
[3179.72 --> 3181.74]  Particularly
[3181.74 --> 3183.24]  To think
[3183.24 --> 3184.22]  A certain way
[3184.22 --> 3184.92]  And to be
[3184.92 --> 3186.00]  Obedient
[3186.00 --> 3187.64]  In a particular
[3187.64 --> 3188.34]  Direction
[3188.34 --> 3189.70]  And in that
[3189.70 --> 3190.94]  Thinking and
[3190.94 --> 3191.58]  Obedience
[3191.58 --> 3192.02]  To be
[3192.02 --> 3193.02]  Hopeful
[3193.02 --> 3195.46]  Now
[3195.46 --> 3197.56]  As you might
[3197.56 --> 3198.02]  Expect
[3198.02 --> 3199.64]  This idea
[3199.64 --> 3200.24]  Is also
[3200.24 --> 3201.54]  Conveyed
[3201.54 --> 3201.94]  In the
[3201.94 --> 3202.34]  Heidelberg
[3202.34 --> 3202.98]  Catechism
[3202.98 --> 3204.04]  The Heidelberg
[3204.04 --> 3204.60]  Catechism
[3204.60 --> 3205.06]  Is a
[3205.06 --> 3206.28]  Summary
[3206.28 --> 3206.88]  Statement
[3206.88 --> 3207.52]  Of faith
[3207.52 --> 3208.32]  That our church
[3208.32 --> 3208.90]  And a lot
[3208.90 --> 3209.66]  Of sort
[3209.66 --> 3210.28]  Of continental
[3210.28 --> 3210.90]  Reformed
[3210.90 --> 3211.42]  Churches
[3211.42 --> 3211.94]  Use
[3211.94 --> 3212.76]  To help
[3212.76 --> 3213.60]  Us understand
[3213.60 --> 3214.22]  And summarize
[3214.22 --> 3214.92]  The teachings
[3214.92 --> 3215.88]  Of the Bible
[3215.88 --> 3216.28]  It comes
[3216.28 --> 3216.58]  From the
[3216.58 --> 3217.34]  16th century
[3217.34 --> 3218.78]  If a handful
[3218.78 --> 3219.12]  Of you
[3219.12 --> 3219.62]  Thought about
[3219.62 --> 3220.30]  Hebrews 11
[3220.30 --> 3220.82]  When I asked
[3220.82 --> 3221.24]  The question
[3221.24 --> 3221.88]  What is faith
[3221.88 --> 3222.54]  There's maybe
[3222.54 --> 3223.06]  Like three
[3223.06 --> 3223.40]  Of you
[3223.40 --> 3224.00]  That thought
[3224.00 --> 3224.32]  About the
[3224.32 --> 3224.62]  Heidelberg
[3224.62 --> 3225.20]  Catechism
[3225.20 --> 3225.76]  Right
[3225.76 --> 3226.40]  Question and
[3226.40 --> 3226.62]  Answer
[3226.62 --> 3226.92]  Anyone
[3226.92 --> 3228.20]  I didn't
[3228.20 --> 3228.48]  Think so
[3228.48 --> 3228.84]  21
[3228.84 --> 3230.50]  Asks
[3230.50 --> 3230.88]  This
[3230.88 --> 3231.84]  What is
[3231.84 --> 3232.32]  True
[3232.32 --> 3233.12]  Faith
[3233.12 --> 3235.14]  And then it
[3235.14 --> 3235.54]  Goes on to
[3235.54 --> 3235.72]  Say
[3235.72 --> 3236.48]  True faith
[3236.48 --> 3237.30]  Is not only
[3237.30 --> 3237.82]  A sure
[3237.82 --> 3238.42]  Knowledge
[3238.42 --> 3239.06]  By which
[3239.06 --> 3239.70]  I hold
[3239.70 --> 3240.38]  As true
[3240.38 --> 3241.50]  All that
[3241.50 --> 3242.06]  God has
[3242.06 --> 3242.44]  Revealed
[3242.44 --> 3242.86]  To us
[3242.86 --> 3243.42]  In scripture
[3243.42 --> 3244.92]  It is also
[3244.92 --> 3246.00]  A wholehearted
[3246.00 --> 3246.56]  Trust
[3246.56 --> 3247.08]  Which the
[3247.08 --> 3247.98]  Holy Spirit
[3247.98 --> 3248.94]  Welcome to

[3249.54 --> 3251.20]  Grants in me
[3251.20 --> 3252.54]  By the gospel
[3252.54 --> 3254.62]  Faith
[3254.62 --> 3255.32]  Is a
[3255.32 --> 3255.90]  Knowledge
[3255.90 --> 3256.44]  By which
[3256.44 --> 3256.94]  I hold
[3256.94 --> 3257.76]  As true
[3257.76 --> 3258.76]  And a
[3258.76 --> 3259.34]  Wholehearted
[3259.34 --> 3259.90]  Trust
[3259.90 --> 3261.30]  Created in me
[3261.30 --> 3261.94]  Knowledge
[3261.94 --> 3262.76]  And trust
[3262.76 --> 3263.34]  Belief
[3263.34 --> 3263.80]  Faith and
[3263.80 --> 3264.26]  Commitment
[3264.26 --> 3264.78]  Thinking
[3264.78 --> 3265.58]  And
[3265.58 --> 3266.38]  Doing
[3266.38 --> 3267.04]  It is
[3267.04 --> 3268.12]  Hopeful
[3268.12 --> 3269.30]  Obedience
[3269.30 --> 3270.62]  Faith
[3270.62 --> 3271.30]  As I hope
[3271.30 --> 3271.74]  You are
[3271.74 --> 3272.34]  Beginning to
[3272.34 --> 3272.66]  See
[3272.66 --> 3273.32]  Is a
[3273.32 --> 3274.24]  Comprehensive
[3274.24 --> 3275.18]  Term
[3275.18 --> 3275.84]  That means
[3275.84 --> 3276.30]  A lot
[3276.30 --> 3277.16]  But also
[3277.16 --> 3278.08]  Does
[3278.08 --> 3279.56]  A lot
[3279.56 --> 3281.28]  And
[3281.28 --> 3282.54]  Right
[3282.54 --> 3283.16]  Faith
[3283.16 --> 3284.20]  Is a
[3284.20 --> 3284.54]  Gift
[3284.54 --> 3285.72]  Right
[3285.72 --> 3286.06]  We read
[3286.06 --> 3286.50]  In the
[3286.50 --> 3287.34]  Catechism
[3287.34 --> 3287.56]  There
[3287.56 --> 3288.02]  Which the
[3288.02 --> 3288.80]  Holy Spirit
[3288.80 --> 3289.44]  Creates
[3289.44 --> 3289.92]  In me
[3289.92 --> 3290.66]  By the
[3290.66 --> 3291.08]  Gospel
[3291.08 --> 3292.32]  Paul writes
[3292.32 --> 3292.72]  In
[3292.72 --> 3293.36]  Ephesians
[3293.36 --> 3293.74]  2
[3293.74 --> 3294.96]  For by
[3294.96 --> 3295.40]  Grace
[3295.40 --> 3296.22]  You have
[3296.22 --> 3296.42]  Been
[3296.42 --> 3296.96]  Saved
[3296.96 --> 3297.74]  Through
[3297.74 --> 3298.50]  Faith
[3298.50 --> 3299.68]  And this
[3299.68 --> 3300.02]  Is not
[3300.02 --> 3300.54]  Your own
[3300.54 --> 3300.92]  Doing
[3300.92 --> 3302.12]  It is
[3302.12 --> 3302.66]  The gift
[3302.66 --> 3303.90]  Of
[3303.90 --> 3304.26]  God
[3304.26 --> 3306.16]  Now
[3306.16 --> 3310.08]  Did you
[3310.08 --> 3310.42]  Notice
[3310.42 --> 3311.82]  As we
[3311.82 --> 3313.02]  Went through
[3313.02 --> 3313.64]  All those
[3313.64 --> 3314.76]  Definitions
[3314.76 --> 3315.26]  Of what
[3315.26 --> 3315.64]  Faith
[3315.64 --> 3316.10]  Is
[3316.10 --> 3317.10]  Faith
[3317.10 --> 3317.42]  Is
[3317.42 --> 3318.12]  Never
[3318.12 --> 3319.96]  Passive
[3319.96 --> 3322.48]  Faith
[3322.48 --> 3323.10]  Never
[3323.10 --> 3323.88]  Sits
[3323.88 --> 3324.88]  Idle
[3324.88 --> 3325.92]  It
[3325.92 --> 3326.22]  Never
[3326.22 --> 3326.60]  Does
[3326.60 --> 3327.22]  Nothing
[3327.22 --> 3328.60]  That's a
[3328.60 --> 3328.76]  Double
[3328.76 --> 3329.10]  Negative
[3329.10 --> 3330.20]  It
[3330.20 --> 3330.64]  Always
[3330.64 --> 3330.96]  Does
[3330.96 --> 3331.42]  Something

[3659.84 --> 3662.02]  The
[3662.02 --> 3662.26]  Muscle
[3662.26 --> 3662.40]  Of
[3662.40 --> 3663.58]  Faith
[3663.58 --> 3664.76]  When
[3664.76 --> 3666.08]  You
[3666.08 --> 3666.36]  Stop
[3666.36 --> 3667.10]  Pursuing
[3667.10 --> 3667.66]  Growth
[3667.66 --> 3667.92]  Growth
[3667.92 --> 3668.30]  Doesn't
[3668.30 --> 3668.66]  Happen
[3668.66 --> 3687.20]  Now even as I say that I know that that's a bit of an aphorism that's a truism right that it sounds obvious if you don't pursue growth you won't grow but it's worth stating because I can't tell you how many times people in our conversations haven't put two and two together people say to me I kind of lost my faith
[3687.20 --> 3688.48]  People say I don't really feel faith.
[3688.48 --> 3690.60]  People say I don't really feel anything.
[3690.60 --> 3698.84]  I'm not sure I believe I want to believe at least I think I want to believe I know it's right that I should believe that I should have more faith but I just don't have it.
[3700.20 --> 3704.10]  And so then I ask well what are you doing to grow your faith?
[3705.70 --> 3707.30]  What are you doing to find faith?
[3707.80 --> 3711.26]  How are you actively seeking God in the midst of this?
[3711.26 --> 3718.16]  What are you doing to grow your faith to increase your capacity for faith to flex the muscle of your faith?
[3719.24 --> 3721.24]  Again let's continue this analogy.
[3722.08 --> 3735.88]  It's not fair right if I go around complaining to you that I don't have a washboard stomach and can't bench press 300 pounds and then all I do is sit on the couch and eat another pizza.
[3735.88 --> 3742.60]  Right sooner or later someone needs to say to me get your fat butt in the gym if that's what you want.
[3744.06 --> 3751.76]  And if you want a stronger capacity for faith maybe you need to get your butt into a holy habit.
[3753.76 --> 3759.80]  And again here's this other thing about muscles right if you don't use them you will lose them.
[3759.80 --> 3763.88]  Truth is unused muscle atrophies.
[3764.30 --> 3765.90]  It wastes away and it dies.
[3767.80 --> 3777.58]  Maybe you've had opportunity either through work or with family or however the case may be but to see someone who goes into palliative care.
[3778.88 --> 3779.04]  Right?
[3779.18 --> 3780.12]  I've seen it before.
[3780.26 --> 3786.22]  Someone goes into palliative care and they're strong and they're healthy and then just weeks later,
[3786.22 --> 3788.58]  maybe a month later,
[3788.70 --> 3790.52]  because they're trapped in bed,
[3790.92 --> 3795.46]  they're gaunt and their skin is hanging loose off their arms and legs.
[3795.62 --> 3801.68]  And I've seen it becomes hard even to hold a cup and bring it to your mouth to take a sip.
[3803.06 --> 3805.58]  Muscles atrophy without use.
[3807.66 --> 3811.44]  Faith atrophies without use.
[3811.44 --> 3814.60]  Some of you here this morning,
[3814.70 --> 3816.36]  some of you listening online,
[3816.50 --> 3817.94]  have ignored your faith
[3817.94 --> 3821.00]  and your muscles have become weak
[3821.00 --> 3826.12]  and then you've begun to define your experience of faith on those weak muscles.
[3829.78 --> 3830.74]  Some of you,
[3831.74 --> 3833.38]  let's be bold,
[3834.08 --> 3835.10]  are dead inside.
[3836.96 --> 3838.10]  You just don't show it.
[3838.58 --> 3838.76]  Right?
[3838.78 --> 3839.74]  You've learned how to hide it.
[3839.74 --> 3845.14]  And some of us haven't experienced this kind of growth in faith for so long
[3845.14 --> 3847.02]  that we now just don't believe it's even possible.
[3848.20 --> 3849.30]  And if that's you,
[3850.58 --> 3852.68]  if that strikes a chord in any way,
[3852.80 --> 3857.90]  it is my prayer that this series is used by the Holy Spirit
[3857.90 --> 3860.02]  to get your butt into a holy habit.
[3861.60 --> 3864.86]  And then that God will use that to grow your faith,
[3864.94 --> 3866.34]  to reveal himself to you,
[3866.34 --> 3872.70]  to stir your heart's affections as you are captivated by the glory of his presence in your life.
[3873.62 --> 3874.68]  But here's the thing,
[3875.42 --> 3876.50]  and this is for all of us.
[3876.98 --> 3878.10]  If you want more,
[3878.66 --> 3879.74]  you're going to have to do more.
[3881.02 --> 3882.12]  If you are here,
[3882.22 --> 3887.90]  it's our hope that you hunger for a greater depth and vitality in your faith and in your life.
[3887.90 --> 3892.96]  And you may be here because there's part of your heart that says,
[3893.06 --> 3894.72]  there's a part of you that says,
[3894.86 --> 3896.18]  I want more than this.
[3897.04 --> 3901.92]  I want a spirit-filled life that feels more like life.
[3901.92 --> 3905.78]  And you might be here because you don't know how to get there,
[3905.88 --> 3907.20]  how to gain access,
[3907.34 --> 3909.94]  or how to flex your muscles of faith.
[3911.28 --> 3912.94]  And so over the next five weeks,
[3913.02 --> 3916.44]  our hope is to introduce to you
[3916.44 --> 3920.48]  and start you off in some practices of faith,
[3920.84 --> 3922.30]  some holy habits.
[3922.40 --> 3923.00]  And to do that,
[3923.06 --> 3923.84]  we have this book.
[3923.94 --> 3924.56]  You can see it.
[3924.58 --> 3925.72]  You've been flipping through it.
[3925.72 --> 3927.44]  You'll notice that every week,
[3927.56 --> 3929.70]  there is a section for sermon notes,
[3929.80 --> 3932.56]  so you can jot down ideas and thoughts.
[3933.58 --> 3938.14]  Gives you a bit of the theme statement for that week and for that service.
[3938.58 --> 3941.44]  Then there's a section for your own journaling to go through.
[3942.50 --> 3945.74]  And you can think through some things there with a pen.
[3946.90 --> 3950.04]  And then there's a section called throughout the week,
[3950.44 --> 3955.36]  where we give you things to discuss or to look at and to practice.
[3955.72 --> 3960.50]  You'll notice if you're looking at week one throughout the week,
[3961.10 --> 3966.30]  there's a link in there to the Faith Practices Project,
[3966.90 --> 3970.96]  which comes from the Faith Formation Ministries of the Christian Reformed Church.
[3971.50 --> 3973.82]  This is a really great resource for you
[3973.82 --> 3979.60]  as you dig into some of the spiritual practices that we are holding out
[3979.60 --> 3982.48]  and some new ones and other ones.
[3982.48 --> 3986.16]  Like I said at the very beginning,
[3986.74 --> 3991.36]  we in our time here are going to focus on four key practices
[3991.36 --> 3995.58]  that are largely connected to the description of the early church
[3995.58 --> 3997.18]  that we read in Acts 2.
[3997.66 --> 3998.76]  How they came together,
[3998.88 --> 4002.88]  how they did life and devotion and practiced together.
[4003.02 --> 4004.64]  So we will talk about Bible reading.
[4005.26 --> 4008.22]  We will talk about prayer and worship together.
[4008.22 --> 4011.94]  We are going to talk and learn about what it means to rest
[4011.94 --> 4015.28]  and how to practice the spiritual discipline of rest
[4015.28 --> 4018.20]  and to be part of a community that rests.
[4019.02 --> 4025.02]  And then we will end with a discussion on giving to the mission of Jesus,
[4025.32 --> 4028.42]  both with our finances as well in Acts of Service,
[4029.16 --> 4033.38]  and how we come together in community to use our time for the kingdom.
[4033.38 --> 4040.10]  So myself and Pastor Kevin and Josh are going to be leading over these next few weeks
[4040.10 --> 4046.54]  based on our experiences, our practices of these holy habits together.
[4046.54 --> 4051.68]  And we really do invite you to dig in deep with the help of this book
[4051.68 --> 4054.76]  and with the help of your community around you.
[4055.48 --> 4059.64]  And so whether that's a care group or another ministry group that you are part of,
[4059.64 --> 4066.22]  dig in together in your community groups through these holy habits.
[4067.60 --> 4071.32]  And then even as we strive to grow and to be grown,
[4071.40 --> 4074.06]  even as we work to flex the muscle of faith,
[4074.40 --> 4079.16]  I'm going to hold out for you as a promise the truth of Philippians 2.
[4079.98 --> 4080.42]  Right?
[4080.50 --> 4080.84]  We read,
[4080.84 --> 4095.96]  So there is a call to do something.
[4096.60 --> 4099.06]  Continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling,
[4099.18 --> 4105.08]  for it is God who works in you to will and to act according to his good purposes
[4105.08 --> 4107.68]  in order to fill his good purpose.
[4107.68 --> 4111.48]  If you look at the structure of the chapter here in Philippians 2,
[4111.92 --> 4116.44]  on the good and sure confession and profession of who Jesus is,
[4116.70 --> 4118.34]  right, who being in very nature God,
[4118.44 --> 4121.98]  did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage.
[4122.40 --> 4126.16]  Rather, he made himself nothing by taking on the very nature of a servant,
[4126.28 --> 4129.56]  being made in human likeness and being found in appearance as a man.
[4129.80 --> 4132.44]  He humbled himself by becoming obedient to death,
[4132.86 --> 4134.36]  even death on the cross.
[4134.36 --> 4138.78]  Therefore, God exalted him to the highest place
[4138.78 --> 4140.80]  and gave him the name that is above every name,
[4140.88 --> 4143.18]  that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow in heaven
[4143.18 --> 4144.62]  and on earth and under the earth,
[4144.66 --> 4148.12]  and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
[4148.12 --> 4150.18]  to the glory of God the Father.
[4150.32 --> 4153.86]  On the sure foundation of who Jesus is,
[4154.86 --> 4158.36]  on the truth that Jesus lived the life I should have lived,
[4158.44 --> 4160.32]  that he died the death that I deserve,
[4160.38 --> 4163.10]  and that three days later he was raised victorious,
[4163.10 --> 4165.68]  on the truth that this same Jesus who was raised
[4165.68 --> 4169.42]  appeared to the disciples for over a period of 40 days,
[4169.52 --> 4173.20]  and that he rose and ascended to the right hand of the Father,
[4173.32 --> 4176.36]  and that this same Jesus, along with the Father on Pentecost,
[4176.52 --> 4178.80]  sent the Spirit now down to you.
[4178.98 --> 4183.20]  On the sure promise of who Jesus is and what he has done,
[4183.36 --> 4184.78]  he calls you to respond.
[4186.28 --> 4188.88]  Work out your salvation with fear and trembling,
[4188.88 --> 4192.88]  for it is God who works in you.
[4194.08 --> 4199.76]  We are called to grow and to stretch and to flex the muscle of our faith.
[4200.06 --> 4201.66]  And Peter says in his second letter,
[4201.98 --> 4203.26]  to make every effort.
[4204.10 --> 4207.12]  We are called to work and to run with perseverance.
[4207.62 --> 4210.26]  We are called to be diligent in our pursuit of godliness.
[4210.52 --> 4211.88]  And we do these things,
[4211.88 --> 4214.14]  we are spurred forward in these things,
[4214.14 --> 4215.80]  in the promise of God,
[4215.86 --> 4218.86]  that it is God himself who works in you
[4218.86 --> 4222.98]  to will and to act according to his good purpose.
[4224.68 --> 4225.74]  Marjorie Thompson,
[4226.46 --> 4228.02]  in her excellent little book,
[4228.86 --> 4231.74]  which was actually first brought to my attention
[4231.74 --> 4234.40]  by Rachel at a Bible study group that she was part of,
[4234.82 --> 4236.02]  it's called Soul Feast.
[4236.78 --> 4237.46]  She writes,
[4237.46 --> 4241.18]  Christian spirituality begins with God,
[4241.86 --> 4242.96]  depends on God,
[4243.36 --> 4244.96]  and ends in God.
[4246.26 --> 4248.12]  Flexing the faith muscle,
[4248.56 --> 4250.62]  the life of holy habits,
[4251.02 --> 4253.50]  is initiated and sustained by God
[4253.50 --> 4256.60]  who lives within us and is beyond us.
[4256.94 --> 4260.28]  The life of spiritual discipline is not a task,
[4260.28 --> 4260.96]  and hear this,
[4261.20 --> 4262.56]  of self-reformation.
[4263.02 --> 4265.08]  This is not self-help.
[4265.08 --> 4270.64]  And there's no easy DIY manual for this journey,
[4271.14 --> 4272.74]  the book that we gave you notwithstanding.
[4273.50 --> 4275.00]  But there is a path.
[4275.68 --> 4276.84]  There are helps.
[4277.18 --> 4280.42]  And there are a way that we can do this together.
[4281.90 --> 4283.98]  I'm going to end this morning
[4283.98 --> 4287.06]  with two final quick points.
[4287.06 --> 4289.58]  First,
[4290.46 --> 4293.84]  what we do with our time,
[4294.46 --> 4296.06]  what we do with our resources,
[4296.28 --> 4297.68]  what we do with our skills,
[4298.20 --> 4300.40]  reveals to us
[4300.40 --> 4302.78]  and to the people around us
[4302.78 --> 4304.06]  what we love,
[4304.84 --> 4306.08]  what we think is important.
[4307.90 --> 4308.42]  Simultaneously,
[4308.76 --> 4310.16]  and then also inversely,
[4310.64 --> 4312.72]  the kinds of things that we love
[4312.72 --> 4314.76]  will determine and will shape
[4314.76 --> 4316.46]  how we use our time
[4316.46 --> 4317.54]  and our resources
[4317.54 --> 4318.66]  and our skills.
[4319.40 --> 4319.52]  Right?
[4319.54 --> 4320.78]  There's an interplay
[4320.78 --> 4321.86]  between the two.
[4322.32 --> 4323.60]  There's a back and forth
[4323.60 --> 4324.56]  that happens.
[4326.26 --> 4327.64]  My understanding on this
[4327.64 --> 4328.40]  has been shaped
[4328.40 --> 4329.82]  by a Christian philosopher
[4329.82 --> 4330.96]  named Jamie Smith.
[4331.06 --> 4332.82]  You've heard me quote him before.
[4333.68 --> 4334.64]  And he says this.
[4334.68 --> 4336.30]  This is a bit of a longer quote,
[4336.42 --> 4337.12]  but it is good.
[4337.32 --> 4337.72]  And so,
[4338.34 --> 4339.18]  bear with me.
[4339.54 --> 4339.96]  He says,
[4339.96 --> 4343.86]  we have completely underestimated
[4343.86 --> 4345.18]  the power of habit
[4345.18 --> 4347.46]  and the deformative power
[4347.46 --> 4349.24]  of cultural practices.
[4350.56 --> 4352.20]  That's why I, Jamie,
[4352.44 --> 4353.66]  call these practices
[4353.66 --> 4355.12]  cultural liturgies
[4355.12 --> 4356.06]  because they are
[4356.06 --> 4357.68]  heart-shaping rituals
[4357.68 --> 4359.30]  that actually shape
[4359.30 --> 4360.16]  what we love.
[4361.24 --> 4363.10]  But that's also why
[4363.10 --> 4364.60]  the counter-formative,
[4365.06 --> 4366.10]  reordering power
[4366.10 --> 4367.60]  of the Spirit is necessary.
[4367.60 --> 4369.70]  And that reformation
[4369.70 --> 4370.62]  of the Spirit
[4370.62 --> 4372.02]  happens in the gifts
[4372.02 --> 4372.74]  of worship
[4372.74 --> 4373.64]  He gives
[4373.64 --> 4374.78]  in the body of Christ.
[4375.14 --> 4376.42]  Regeneration by the Spirit
[4376.42 --> 4377.16]  is what makes
[4377.16 --> 4378.68]  any of this possible,
[4379.18 --> 4381.10]  but it is the ongoing
[4381.10 --> 4382.54]  rehabituation
[4382.54 --> 4383.96]  of the Spirit
[4383.96 --> 4384.76]  in worship,
[4385.24 --> 4386.34]  in holy habits,
[4386.66 --> 4388.10]  that re-centers us
[4388.10 --> 4388.96]  in Christ
[4388.96 --> 4390.28]  so that we can be sent
[4390.28 --> 4391.14]  into the world
[4391.14 --> 4392.72]  in ways that we can be
[4392.72 --> 4394.24]  faithfully present,
[4394.54 --> 4395.88]  as James Davison Hunter
[4395.88 --> 4396.32]  puts it.
[4396.32 --> 4398.38]  If we are only sent out
[4398.38 --> 4399.20]  with a worldview,
[4399.46 --> 4399.74]  that is,
[4399.78 --> 4400.36]  if we only had
[4400.36 --> 4401.28]  the right ideas,
[4401.88 --> 4402.82]  we might be present
[4402.82 --> 4403.68]  in our culture,
[4403.94 --> 4404.90]  but our faith
[4404.90 --> 4406.14]  is going to be eroded
[4406.14 --> 4408.74]  by its deformative rituals.
[4410.02 --> 4412.38]  What we do matters.
[4414.28 --> 4415.86]  The holy habits of faith
[4415.86 --> 4419.58]  are these counter-formative practices.
[4419.82 --> 4420.32]  You can see it
[4420.32 --> 4422.42]  in your booklet.
[4422.54 --> 4423.48]  At the beginning of the
[4423.48 --> 4424.54]  throughout the week section,
[4424.54 --> 4425.74]  there is the same quote
[4425.74 --> 4427.90]  given there every week
[4427.90 --> 4428.74]  because it's important
[4428.74 --> 4430.12]  to hear and remember.
[4430.28 --> 4430.74]  It says,
[4431.68 --> 4432.38]  spiritual disciplines
[4432.38 --> 4434.34]  are counter-formative,
[4434.72 --> 4435.64]  missional rhythms
[4435.64 --> 4436.46]  of resistance
[4436.46 --> 4437.22]  where communities
[4437.22 --> 4438.14]  and individuals
[4438.14 --> 4439.36]  over time
[4439.36 --> 4440.60]  experience the love
[4440.60 --> 4441.20]  of the Father,
[4441.60 --> 4442.26]  the transformative
[4442.26 --> 4443.26]  presence of Jesus,
[4443.42 --> 4444.06]  and the power
[4444.06 --> 4444.98]  of the Holy Spirit
[4444.98 --> 4446.04]  for the purpose
[4446.04 --> 4447.16]  of loving God
[4447.16 --> 4449.18]  and neighbor.
[4450.92 --> 4451.94]  That's why we are
[4451.94 --> 4452.52]  doing this.
[4453.36 --> 4454.84]  That's why this is important.
[4455.26 --> 4456.82]  Because you are already
[4456.82 --> 4458.16]  being shaped
[4458.16 --> 4459.48]  in a certain direction.
[4460.90 --> 4461.92]  Be shaped
[4461.92 --> 4463.98]  for the glory of God.
[4464.12 --> 4464.74]  Be shaped
[4464.74 --> 4465.44]  in obedience
[4465.44 --> 4466.68]  to Him.
[4467.46 --> 4467.96]  And then finally,
[4468.06 --> 4469.88]  this is the last point.
[4469.88 --> 4473.36]  We heard it there.
[4474.24 --> 4474.92]  For the purpose
[4474.92 --> 4475.90]  of loving God
[4475.90 --> 4476.96]  and neighbor.
[4478.14 --> 4479.52]  The life of the disciple
[4479.52 --> 4480.62]  of Jesus
[4480.62 --> 4481.96]  is always
[4481.96 --> 4483.34]  up and
[4483.34 --> 4484.08]  out.
[4484.84 --> 4486.18]  We journey in
[4486.18 --> 4487.42]  for the journey out.
[4487.58 --> 4488.42]  We gather
[4488.42 --> 4489.68]  to scatter.
[4490.32 --> 4491.24]  Or how we're going
[4491.24 --> 4491.76]  to put it here
[4491.76 --> 4492.46]  in this series,
[4493.14 --> 4494.38]  holy habits
[4494.38 --> 4495.78]  always have
[4495.78 --> 4497.08]  an inward aspect
[4497.08 --> 4498.72]  that is a personal
[4498.72 --> 4500.02]  relationship to God
[4500.02 --> 4501.88]  and an outward
[4501.88 --> 4502.94]  aspect.
[4503.82 --> 4504.88]  How that relationship
[4504.88 --> 4505.72]  is lived
[4505.72 --> 4507.02]  in and expressed
[4507.02 --> 4508.50]  to or changes
[4508.50 --> 4510.12]  your community,
[4510.62 --> 4511.62]  your neighbor.
[4512.50 --> 4513.38]  And this is important
[4513.38 --> 4514.86]  because I think
[4514.86 --> 4515.84]  too often
[4515.84 --> 4517.54]  we make this mistake.
[4518.26 --> 4519.16]  And we think
[4519.16 --> 4520.52]  that spiritual disciplines,
[4521.00 --> 4521.92]  that holy habits
[4521.92 --> 4523.48]  are only about
[4523.48 --> 4524.70]  cloistering
[4524.70 --> 4525.68]  in your room
[4525.68 --> 4526.96]  or in your small group
[4526.96 --> 4527.44]  community,
[4527.58 --> 4528.60]  about isolating
[4528.60 --> 4529.76]  yourself from the world
[4529.76 --> 4531.68]  and your impact
[4531.68 --> 4532.58]  from your relationship
[4532.58 --> 4533.14]  to God
[4533.14 --> 4534.14]  and separating
[4534.14 --> 4534.80]  the impact
[4534.80 --> 4535.42]  of your relationship
[4535.42 --> 4535.94]  to God
[4535.94 --> 4537.54]  from your relationship
[4537.54 --> 4538.32]  to your neighbor.
[4539.20 --> 4540.40]  Spiritual disciplines,
[4540.92 --> 4541.60]  holy habits,
[4541.76 --> 4542.78]  developing the life
[4542.78 --> 4543.20]  of faith,
[4543.52 --> 4544.58]  learning how to flex
[4544.58 --> 4546.16]  the muscle of faith
[4546.16 --> 4547.86]  will always orient us
[4547.86 --> 4548.96]  towards God,
[4549.34 --> 4549.58]  right,
[4549.64 --> 4550.20]  in relationship
[4550.20 --> 4550.68]  with Him
[4550.68 --> 4552.60]  and towards neighbor
[4552.60 --> 4554.32]  in service of them.
[4555.42 --> 4556.30]  There is an inward
[4556.30 --> 4557.30]  relational aspect
[4557.30 --> 4558.32]  and an outward
[4558.32 --> 4559.86]  missional aspect
[4559.86 --> 4561.70]  to neighbor.
[4562.66 --> 4563.72]  Spiritual disciplines,
[4563.98 --> 4564.66]  holy habits,
[4565.02 --> 4567.42]  always will have both.
[4567.68 --> 4568.38]  Or at least
[4568.38 --> 4570.46]  good holy habits
[4570.46 --> 4571.16]  and practicing
[4571.16 --> 4572.24]  of good holy habits
[4572.24 --> 4574.20]  will always include both.
[4574.34 --> 4575.28]  And so then,
[4575.66 --> 4576.40]  each week
[4576.40 --> 4578.78]  as you practice
[4578.78 --> 4580.66]  these disciplines,
[4581.14 --> 4582.36]  you will be encouraged
[4582.36 --> 4583.80]  and reminded
[4583.80 --> 4585.10]  to think beyond
[4585.10 --> 4585.64]  yourself.
[4586.68 --> 4588.08]  Think about the community
[4588.08 --> 4589.08]  around you
[4589.08 --> 4590.04]  as you practice
[4590.04 --> 4591.66]  these holy habits.
[4592.56 --> 4593.04]  And here's
[4593.04 --> 4593.88]  what I believe,
[4593.94 --> 4594.66]  and I offer this
[4594.66 --> 4596.38]  as a hopeful promise
[4596.38 --> 4596.72]  to you.
[4597.82 --> 4598.94]  I believe
[4598.94 --> 4600.74]  that stories
[4600.74 --> 4601.96]  of transformation
[4601.96 --> 4603.50]  in you
[4603.50 --> 4605.22]  fuel
[4605.22 --> 4606.56]  transformation
[4606.56 --> 4607.82]  in others.
[4607.82 --> 4609.94]  So you,
[4610.14 --> 4611.08]  telling stories
[4611.08 --> 4611.58]  of how you
[4611.58 --> 4612.04]  have seen
[4612.04 --> 4612.80]  God at work
[4612.80 --> 4613.64]  in your life
[4613.64 --> 4614.92]  over a short period
[4614.92 --> 4615.84]  or a long period
[4615.84 --> 4617.40]  encourages others
[4617.40 --> 4618.50]  and enables others
[4618.50 --> 4619.50]  to see God
[4619.50 --> 4619.82]  at work
[4619.82 --> 4620.24]  in theirs.
[4621.46 --> 4621.60]  Right?
[4621.74 --> 4622.74]  Stories of transformation
[4622.74 --> 4623.90]  in your life
[4623.90 --> 4624.96]  fuel transformation
[4624.96 --> 4626.08]  in others.
[4626.22 --> 4626.64]  And so,
[4626.82 --> 4627.72]  this week
[4627.72 --> 4629.30]  and for the next five,
[4629.72 --> 4630.28]  let's commit
[4630.28 --> 4631.16]  to telling
[4631.16 --> 4632.06]  these sorts
[4632.06 --> 4632.92]  of stories
[4632.92 --> 4634.20]  of our faith
[4634.20 --> 4634.68]  at work
[4634.68 --> 4635.20]  in the world.
[4635.68 --> 4635.92]  Right?
[4635.92 --> 4636.96]  Our faith growing
[4636.96 --> 4637.74]  in relationship
[4637.74 --> 4638.32]  to God
[4638.32 --> 4639.02]  and neighbor.
[4639.14 --> 4640.04]  Our faith struggling
[4640.04 --> 4641.04]  and doubts
[4641.04 --> 4641.78]  made real,
[4642.14 --> 4642.76]  but our faith
[4642.76 --> 4644.10]  lived and expressed
[4644.10 --> 4645.14]  in community
[4645.14 --> 4646.28]  that hears
[4646.28 --> 4647.40]  and knows
[4647.40 --> 4647.80]  and then
[4647.80 --> 4649.20]  holds us up.
[4650.86 --> 4651.26]  And so,
[4651.48 --> 4652.90]  as a family
[4652.90 --> 4654.46]  or in your small group
[4654.46 --> 4655.42]  or as a group
[4655.42 --> 4656.18]  of friends,
[4656.78 --> 4657.56]  make a plan
[4657.56 --> 4658.34]  together
[4658.34 --> 4660.00]  to practice
[4660.00 --> 4660.88]  this series
[4660.88 --> 4661.44]  with us.
[4662.08 --> 4662.92]  And then tell
[4662.92 --> 4663.38]  each other
[4663.38 --> 4664.02]  that plan.
[4664.72 --> 4665.28]  Hold each other
[4665.28 --> 4665.76]  accountable
[4665.76 --> 4666.44]  in that plan.
[4666.74 --> 4668.24]  Set up a text group
[4668.24 --> 4669.52]  or a WhatsApp group
[4669.52 --> 4670.76]  or a Facebook group.
[4670.84 --> 4671.18]  I don't know
[4671.18 --> 4672.04]  how Facebook works.
[4672.56 --> 4672.70]  Right?
[4672.74 --> 4673.08]  Where you could
[4673.08 --> 4674.90]  tell people
[4674.90 --> 4675.74]  this is what I'm doing
[4675.74 --> 4676.62]  and get encouraged
[4676.62 --> 4676.94]  in it.
[4676.96 --> 4677.46]  Where you can hold
[4677.46 --> 4678.60]  each other accountable.
[4678.90 --> 4679.68]  Share what you're
[4679.68 --> 4680.60]  reading in the Bible
[4680.60 --> 4681.78]  and ask
[4681.78 --> 4682.56]  what you can
[4682.56 --> 4683.56]  receive
[4683.56 --> 4685.26]  and pray over.
[4686.06 --> 4686.26]  Right?
[4686.36 --> 4687.18]  These are
[4687.18 --> 4688.84]  your disciplines
[4688.84 --> 4690.96]  but this is also
[4690.96 --> 4691.84]  your community.
[4693.20 --> 4694.02]  We do these
[4694.02 --> 4694.58]  things together.
[4694.58 --> 4696.82]  as we
[4696.82 --> 4698.32]  start this
[4698.32 --> 4698.76]  journey
[4698.76 --> 4699.74]  together
[4699.74 --> 4701.84]  I for one
[4701.84 --> 4703.12]  am excited
[4703.12 --> 4703.64]  to see what
[4703.64 --> 4704.12]  God will do.
[4705.24 --> 4706.06]  As we start
[4706.06 --> 4706.50]  this journey
[4706.50 --> 4706.88]  together
[4706.88 --> 4707.90]  I also know
[4707.90 --> 4708.88]  we need to start
[4708.88 --> 4709.24]  in prayer.
[4710.04 --> 4710.42]  And so will you
[4710.42 --> 4710.84]  pray with me?
[4711.56 --> 4712.08]  Let's pray.
[4712.08 --> 4718.60]  Lord Jesus
[4718.60 --> 4719.66]  as we
[4719.66 --> 4720.94]  come to you
[4720.94 --> 4721.50]  at the beginning
[4721.50 --> 4722.30]  of this
[4722.30 --> 4722.76]  journey
[4722.76 --> 4723.94]  of growing
[4723.94 --> 4724.72]  in holy
[4724.72 --> 4725.28]  habits
[4725.28 --> 4726.40]  we pray
[4726.40 --> 4727.02]  that you
[4727.02 --> 4727.92]  would be
[4727.92 --> 4728.72]  at work
[4728.72 --> 4729.48]  in us
[4729.48 --> 4730.88]  and through us.
[4731.08 --> 4731.38]  We pray
[4731.38 --> 4732.02]  by the power
[4732.02 --> 4733.12]  of your spirit
[4733.12 --> 4733.92]  that we
[4733.92 --> 4734.42]  would be
[4734.42 --> 4735.16]  transformed.
[4735.86 --> 4736.24]  Renew
[4736.24 --> 4737.00]  our minds
[4737.00 --> 4737.74]  change
[4737.74 --> 4739.14]  our lives
[4739.14 --> 4740.30]  grow our
[4740.30 --> 4741.20]  faith
[4741.20 --> 4742.00]  help us
[4742.00 --> 4742.60]  Lord God
[4742.60 --> 4743.62]  to grow
[4743.62 --> 4744.28]  in the
[4744.28 --> 4744.98]  capacity
[4744.98 --> 4746.20]  of faith.
[4747.58 --> 4748.08]  And as
[4748.08 --> 4748.82]  we are
[4748.82 --> 4749.98]  drawn
[4749.98 --> 4751.12]  towards you
[4751.12 --> 4751.86]  Lord God
[4751.86 --> 4752.64]  may we also
[4752.64 --> 4753.30]  be sent
[4753.30 --> 4753.78]  out
[4753.78 --> 4754.56]  to our
[4754.56 --> 4754.90]  neighbors.
[4755.38 --> 4756.14]  As our
[4756.14 --> 4756.62]  relationship
[4756.62 --> 4757.28]  to you
[4757.28 --> 4757.90]  deepens
[4757.90 --> 4758.20]  and is
[4758.20 --> 4758.56]  strengthened
[4758.56 --> 4759.22]  and grows
[4759.22 --> 4760.04]  may our
[4760.04 --> 4760.62]  mission
[4760.62 --> 4761.64]  to our
[4761.64 --> 4762.00]  neighbors
[4762.00 --> 4762.88]  and the
[4762.88 --> 4763.66]  people around
[4763.66 --> 4764.12]  us
[4764.12 --> 4764.58]  to our
[4764.58 --> 4765.28]  communities
[4765.28 --> 4766.50]  may that
[4766.50 --> 4766.78]  be
[4766.78 --> 4767.46]  deepened
[4767.46 --> 4767.90]  and
[4767.90 --> 4768.38]  strengthened.
[4769.24 --> 4770.04]  Equip us
[4770.04 --> 4770.56]  for this
[4770.56 --> 4770.82]  journey
[4770.82 --> 4771.34]  of faith.
[4771.48 --> 4771.56]  We
[4771.56 --> 4772.68]  Lord God
[4772.68 --> 4773.50]  commit to
[4773.50 --> 4774.28]  working out
[4774.28 --> 4775.24]  our salvation
[4775.24 --> 4776.10]  with fear
[4776.10 --> 4777.10]  and trembling
[4777.10 --> 4777.86]  here in
[4777.86 --> 4778.24]  worship
[4778.24 --> 4778.68]  and in
[4778.68 --> 4778.90]  these
[4778.90 --> 4779.26]  holy
[4779.26 --> 4779.98]  habits
[4779.98 --> 4780.48]  and we
[4780.48 --> 4781.14]  trust
[4781.14 --> 4782.18]  that you
[4782.18 --> 4783.18]  will give
[4783.18 --> 4784.00]  the growth.
[4784.62 --> 4784.88]  And so
[4784.88 --> 4785.22]  Lord God
[4785.22 --> 4785.88]  give us
[4785.88 --> 4786.44]  the growth
[4786.44 --> 4787.56]  we pray
[4787.56 --> 4788.60]  in Jesus
[4788.60 --> 4789.32]  holy
[4789.32 --> 4790.24]  name.
[4791.14 --> 4791.36]  Amen.
[4795.28 --> 4801.74]  Let's
[4801.74 --> 4802.26]  rise and
[4802.26 --> 4802.62]  sing with
[4802.62 --> 4803.06]  us as
[4803.06 --> 4803.34]  we
[4803.34 --> 4804.00]  sing
[4804.00 --> 4804.26]  Holy
[4804.26 --> 4804.60]  Spirit.
[4804.60 --> 4804.72]  Amen.
[4825.28 --> 4834.98]  Holy
[4834.98 --> 4836.18]  Spirit
[4836.18 --> 4837.02]  living
[4837.02 --> 4838.22]  breath
[4838.22 --> 4839.70]  of God
[4839.70 --> 4840.62]  renew
[4840.62 --> 4841.62]  life
[4841.62 --> 4842.62]  into
[4842.62 --> 4843.24]  my
[4843.24 --> 4844.04]  willing
[4844.04 --> 4845.80]  soul
