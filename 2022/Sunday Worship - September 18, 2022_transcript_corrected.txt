[50.00 → 55.00] If you left the grave behind you so alive
[55.00 → 62.00] I can see your heart in everything you've done
[62.00 → 68.00] Every part designed in the work of God
[69.00 → 70.00] Call my heart

[77.00 → 84.00] I can see your heart and fill you different away

[86.00 → 89.00] A child you died to save
[90.00 → 94.00] If you gave your life to love them so loud
[94.00 → 100.00] If you gave your life to love them so loud
[101.00 → 108.00] Like you would again a hundred billion times
[108.00 → 114.00] But what measure could amount to your desire
[115.00 → 120.00] You're the one who never leaves the one behind
[121.00 → 125.00] You're the one who never leaves the one behind

[362.10 → 363.06] And making your way
[363.06 → 364.24] And looking at the countdown
[364.24 → 366.32] And thinking, I still have three minutes
[366.32 → 367.20] What's going on?
[367.48 → 368.56] We're going to play a video
[368.56 → 369.96] From this past weekend
[369.96 → 371.70] There was a youth conference
[371.70 → 372.20] Called Reactivate
[372.78 → 374.70] That myself and three other youth pastors
[374.70 → 376.40] Put on with a number of volunteers
[376.40 → 379.06] And a number of churches across BC
[379.06 → 381.10] And, so I wanted to introduce that video
[381.10 → 382.24] We're going to watch it right now
[382.24 → 383.52] And then we will start
[383.52 → 385.08] Church the normal way

[494.08 → 497.08] Because I know you're mine

[632.36 → 635.74] Salvation is here.
[635.74 → 640.76] Because you are alive, and you live in me
[640.76 → 647.74] Because I know I'm not saying that I know it
[647.74 → 654.74] You're alive, and I know I'm not saying that I know it
[654.74 → 658.88] You're going to be alright
[658.88 → 664.74] Because I know I'm not saying that I know it

[695.74 → 698.74] Sub ceiling I can see that I know it
[698.74 → 702.74] Malty
[702.74 → 703.74] Seventh
[703.74 → 706.74] Rooster
[706.74 → 707.74] Tenth
[707.74 → 709.74] Paul
[709.74 → 710.74] Ma'am
[710.74 → 716.34] So that is what the last weekend was like at Reactivate,
[716.34 → 718.18] which was hosted at Willoughby CRC.
[718.34 → 721.86] We had about 160 teens from across BC come out.
[722.74 → 726.70] The theme was enough, and we talked about how Jesus was enough for us all,
[726.76 → 728.76] that we have enough, that they are enough,
[729.16 → 733.68] and we used the passage of Jesus feeding the 5,000 as sort of the theme for that.
[733.74 → 737.38] And then on the one night, we were able to give all the youth and leaders there
[737.38 → 740.28] a piece of bread and fish, which was pretty fun as well.
[740.28 → 742.34] And then you saw all the other fun stuff that we were up to.
[742.48 → 746.72] So what I do want to do, though, is highlight that this church stepped up
[746.72 → 748.82] in a huge way for that weekend to happen.
[749.06 → 753.86] So the majority of the volunteers that came out to make that event run
[753.86 → 755.74] and function as it was from this church.
[756.08 → 759.40] So I just wanted to say a huge thank you to all of you who came out
[759.40 → 763.42] and helped prep food, helped with the parking lot, helped set up stuff,
[763.52 → 768.26] helped turn rooms into workshop areas or eating areas.
[768.26 → 771.12] There was just a great number of you to come up.
[771.16 → 774.00] So I do want to thank you all so much for making that weekend happen.
[774.10 → 776.62] It was a huge blessing for all the youth who came out.
[776.72 → 778.94] So you guys can clap for yourself if you want,
[779.02 → 780.38] because it was a pretty incredible weekend.
[780.52 → 781.58] So thank you so much for that.
[781.58 → 789.58] A couple of other announcements this morning before I have you stand for God's greeting.
[789.80 → 794.20] The first is that we are still looking for one more children's worship time coordinator.
[794.48 → 801.42] So Amy Hubert, she's out in there already, and then Cameron Fischer is doing it as well.
[801.48 → 803.32] But we're looking for one more to help with that.
[803.38 → 807.42] A lot of it will be on the admin side of things, helping with schedules, sending emails.
[807.42 → 811.90] It will happen behind the scenes, but we would love to round out that team and make it a team of three.
[812.02 → 816.30] So if that's something that you're interested in, children's worship time we're hoping gets going next week.
[816.98 → 819.70] But we would love one more person to help join that team.
[819.78 → 822.38] So if that's something you think you can help with, you can be any age.
[822.96 → 824.54] We are just looking for one more person.
[824.68 → 827.20] So please chat with me or with Amy or with Cameron.
[827.68 → 829.72] You can talk to me after the service or email me.
[829.82 → 830.54] That would be wonderful.
[830.54 → 835.78] You may have noticed when you came into the church, all those tables out there.
[835.84 → 837.88] So we're having our little ministry fair this morning.
[838.42 → 843.64] Please, after the service, grab some coffee and take a look at all the different ministries going on there.
[843.66 → 848.18] There are different ministries that are also looking for volunteers to help out with throughout the year.
[848.54 → 852.08] Or maybe there's a ministry you want to get involved in and plugged in with and attend to.
[852.16 → 853.12] So please check that out.
[853.44 → 856.10] See what we've got going on there as well.
[856.10 → 859.16] And before I invite Marguerite, shown up.
[860.70 → 861.46] Marguerite's in the back there.
[861.48 → 863.22] Marguerite's going to come make an announcement in just a moment.
[864.26 → 865.28] We have these little cards.
[865.36 → 871.28] So if you are new with us this morning, or you're checking us out either online or here in the sanctuary here for the first time,
[871.60 → 872.84] we have these cards available.
[872.92 → 874.32] We would love to connect with you.
[874.74 → 876.14] We would love for you to fill this out.
[876.46 → 878.08] Find someone wearing a name tag.
[878.50 → 880.96] Find an elder or an usher or one of us pastors.
[881.50 → 882.90] And we will get you one of these.
[882.90 → 888.86] We'd love to connect with you and get to know you and your story a little bit more and tell you a little bit more about this place.
[888.92 → 890.72] So please do fill that out for us.
[891.12 → 891.96] That would be wonderful.
[892.16 → 892.38] All right.
[892.40 → 893.44] I'm going to invite Marguerite out.
[893.72 → 895.58] And she's got an announcement to make as well.
[902.78 → 903.40] Good morning.
[904.46 → 908.38] This is just an announcement about the upcoming training.
[908.38 → 915.24] And so on behalf of the Safe Church team, I want to remind you that that is taking place tomorrow night at 7 o'clock.
[916.52 → 925.32] If you volunteer in any capacity here in the church working with youth, with children or anybody like considered vulnerable,
[926.02 → 927.56] then this workshop is for you.
[927.56 → 930.22] We have over 100 people volunteering here.
[930.56 → 933.16] So I am expecting a full house tomorrow.
[933.78 → 936.82] The same training will take place on October the 3rd.
[937.00 → 940.10] So if you can't make it tomorrow night, then please come out on the 3rd.
[941.42 → 944.30] We would love it if you register with Sylvia.
[944.42 → 945.34] She's here this morning.
[945.42 → 947.90] So you could even talk to her right after the service.
[947.90 → 952.26] It's supposed to be a really dynamic workshop.
[952.76 → 956.80] And you can come with your questions and with your ears.
[957.06 → 957.32] Listen.
[957.50 → 959.08] And we all have stuff to learn.
[959.60 → 960.88] So please, please come out.
[960.96 → 962.42] It's mandatory to take this training.
[962.54 → 964.78] If you volunteer here, you have to come out.
[964.84 → 968.40] So don't think you can get away with it and just ask somebody else what it was all about.
[968.76 → 969.72] You have to come.
[970.10 → 971.08] So please come tomorrow.
[971.18 → 972.66] I'm looking forward to seeing you here.
[975.94 → 976.68] Thanks, Marguerite.
[976.68 → 981.54] I would love to invite you all to stand now and receive God's greeting for us this morning.
[986.94 → 989.92] God's greeting this morning comes from Revelation 1.
[990.42 → 995.04] Grace and peace to you from him who is and who was and who is to come.
[995.54 → 997.92] And from the seven spirits before his throne.
[998.20 → 1004.66] And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth.
[1005.66 → 1005.96] Amen.
[1005.96 → 1010.38] And once again, as God has greeted us this morning, please take this time to greet those around you.
[1010.44 → 1014.96] Be sensitive to hugs and kisses and handshakes perhaps, but say hello to those around you.
[1014.96 → 1044.94] Thank you.
[1044.96 → 1074.94] Thank you.
[1074.96 → 1076.96] Thank you.
[1104.96 → 1106.96] Thank you.
[1134.96 → 1136.96] Thank you.
[1164.96 → 1166.96] Thank you.
[1194.96 → 1196.96] Thank you.
[1224.96 → 1226.96] Thank you.
[1226.96 → 1228.96] Thank you.
[1228.96 → 1230.96] Thank you.
[1230.96 → 1232.96] Thank you.
[1232.96 → 1234.96] Thank you.
[1234.96 → 1236.96] Thank you.
[1236.96 → 1238.96] Thank you.
[1238.96 → 1240.96] Thank you.
[1240.96 → 1242.96] Thank you.
[1242.96 → 1244.96] Thank you.
[1245.10 → 1246.96] Okay.
[1246.96 → 1247.96] Come.
[1247.96 → 1252.96] Now is a time to worship.
[1252.96 → 1254.96] Come.
[1254.96 → 1262.30] Now is a time to give your hearts.
[1262.30 → 1265.96] Come.
[1265.96 → 1274.82] We come before God in praise and confession of our faith.
[1275.82 → 1282.44] For I believe in God the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
[1295.96 → 1317.92] I want to be close, close to your side.
[1317.92 → 1325.12] So heaven is real and death is a lie.
[1325.12 → 1336.02] I want to hear voices of angels above singing as one.
[1336.58 → 1346.12] Hallelujah, holy, holy, God Almighty.
[1346.12 → 1350.42] The great I am.
[1350.76 → 1353.48] Who is worthy?
[1354.60 → 1357.02] None beside thee.
[1358.02 → 1360.52] God Almighty.
[1361.32 → 1365.02] The great I am.
[1365.02 → 1378.82] I want to be near, near to your heart.
[1378.82 → 1384.82] Love in the world and hate in the dark.
[1385.78 → 1391.82] I want to see dry bones living again.
[1393.02 → 1396.22] Singing as one.
[1396.22 → 1405.82] Hallelujah, holy, holy, God Almighty.
[1406.68 → 1410.12] The great I am.
[1410.12 → 1412.92] Who is worthy?
[1414.08 → 1416.98] None beside thee.
[1417.52 → 1419.80] God Almighty.
[1419.80 → 1424.80] The great I am.
[1424.80 → 1429.70] The mountains shake before you.
[1429.70 → 1433.00] The demons run and flee.
[1433.00 → 1439.40] At the mention of your name, King of majesty.
[1439.40 → 1443.68] There is no power in hell.
[1443.68 → 1447.12] Or any who can stand.
[1447.12 → 1454.90] Before the power and the presence of the great I am.
[1454.90 → 1468.80] The great I am.
[1468.80 → 1471.90] The great I am.
[1471.90 → 1474.70] The great I am.
[1474.70 → 1480.46] Hallelujah
[1480.46 → 1484.72] Holy, holy
[1484.72 → 1487.96] God almighty
[1487.96 → 1492.08] The greater I am
[1492.08 → 1494.92] Who is worthy
[1494.92 → 1498.68] None beside thee
[1498.68 → 1501.40] God almighty
[1501.40 → 1505.56] The great I am
[1505.56 → 1507.32] Hallelujah
[1507.32 → 1511.72] Holy, holy
[1511.72 → 1515.24] God almighty
[1515.24 → 1519.64] The great I am
[1519.64 → 1522.60] Who is worthy
[1522.60 → 1526.68] None beside thee
[1526.68 → 1529.74] God almighty
[1529.74 → 1533.90] The great I am
[1533.90 → 1552.56] I believe in Jesus Christ, his only son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit and was born of the Virgin Mary.
[1552.56 → 1558.88] He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried.
[1559.58 → 1560.84] He descended to hell.
[1561.54 → 1564.32] The third day he rose again from the dead.
[1564.90 → 1570.40] He ascended to heaven and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty.
[1571.20 → 1575.10] From there he will come to judge the living and the dead.
[1575.10 → 1575.18] Amen.
[1575.18 → 1575.22] Amen.
[1582.56 → 1590.42] The centre of all history
[1590.42 → 1596.62] Your cross and resurrection
[1596.62 → 1603.64] Humiliation lifted me
[1603.64 → 1609.24] Into a new creation
[1609.24 → 1615.56] I am a new creation
[1615.56 → 1625.52] My life now yielded to my King
[1625.52 → 1630.62] My will to him surrender
[1630.62 → 1638.28] I'm broken open at your feet
[1638.28 → 1643.32] Your presence is my treasure
[1643.32 → 1649.62] It's you alone I treasure
[1649.62 → 1654.84] Holy
[1654.84 → 1654.86] Holy
[1654.86 → 1659.62] Worthy
[1659.62 → 1667.84] You have no end
[1667.84 → 1669.62] Holy
[1669.62 → 1673.62] Worthy
[1673.62 → 1680.32] We sing
[1680.32 → 1680.62] Amen
[1680.62 → 1682.62] Amen
[1682.62 → 1684.62] Amen
[1684.62 → 1694.16] Let every knee on earth bend low
[1694.16 → 1699.62] And join the host of heaven
[1699.62 → 1706.62] To him who sits upon the throne
[1706.62 → 1711.68] Give praise and adoration
[1711.68 → 1719.28] The gates of hell are overthrown
[1719.28 → 1724.08] The yoke of slavery shattered
[1724.08 → 1728.40] For Christ our King
[1728.40 → 1731.08] He reigns alone
[1731.08 → 1732.34] For Christ our King
[1732.34 → 1733.34] He reigns alone
[1733.34 → 1736.52] Now and forever after
[1736.52 → 1738.66] Now and forever after
[1738.66 → 1742.84] Now and forever after
[1742.84 → 1743.84] Holy
[1743.84 → 1747.84] Holy
[1747.84 → 1749.84] Holy
[1749.84 → 1753.84] Worthy
[1753.84 → 1759.84] You have no end
[1759.84 → 1760.84] Holy
[1760.84 → 1763.84] Worthy
[1763.84 → 1777.84] You have no end
[1777.84 → 1778.84] Holy
[1778.84 → 1785.84] You have no end
[1785.84 → 1786.84] Holy
[1786.84 → 1789.84] You have no end
[1789.84 → 1790.84] Holy
[1790.84 → 1793.84] You have no end
[1793.84 → 1794.84] Holy
[1794.84 → 1795.84] Holy
[1795.84 → 1798.84] We sing
[1798.84 → 1800.84] Amen
[1800.84 → 1801.84] Amen
[1801.84 → 1802.84] Amen
[1802.84 → 1804.84] The centre of all history
[1804.84 → 1806.84] Amen.
[1809.84 → 1820.84] The centre of all history, your cross and resurrection.
[1820.84 → 1844.84] I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.
[1850.84 → 1852.84] Amen.
[1880.84 → 1910.84] 
[1910.84 → 1922.84] Holy Spirit, come abide within. May your joy be seen in all I do.
[1922.84 → 1934.84] Love enough to cover everything in each thought and deed and attitude.
[1934.84 → 1936.84] Amen.
[1936.84 → 1948.84] Kindness to the greatest and the least. Gentleness that sows the path of peace.
[1948.84 → 1960.84] Turn my strivings into works of grace. Breath of God, show Christ in all I do.
[1962.84 → 1974.84] Holy Spirit, from creation's birth, giving life to all that God has made.
[1974.84 → 1988.84] Show your power once again on earth. Cause your church to hunger for your ways.
[1988.84 → 2002.84] Let the fragrance of our prayers arise. Lead us on the road of sacrifice.
[2002.84 → 2016.84] That in unity the face of Christ may be clear for all the world to see.
[2016.84 → 2018.84] Pray with me.
[2018.84 → 2035.84] Holy Spirit, living breath of God, we sing with passion for a renewing of our hearts, that your word may come alive in us, that Christ may be shown in all we do for all the world to see.
[2035.84 → 2039.84] Do we know of what we sing?
[2039.84 → 2041.84] Do we know of what we ask of you, God?
[2041.84 → 2045.84] Or do the words pass through our lips in mindless motion?
[2045.84 → 2055.84] Do we truly desire a renewing of our hearts and minds, a putting off of the old self and living into the new self in Christ?
[2055.84 → 2063.84] Or are we comfortable in our sin and justify our ways in our wayward hearts?
[2063.84 → 2071.84] Deep down in the vulnerability we never show, do we hide in the dark corners of our sin in fear of what the light will reveal?
[2071.84 → 2081.84] Did we not just profess our belief in you, God the Father, Christ the Son, and the Holy Spirit?
[2081.84 → 2084.84] What more do you ask of us, God?
[2084.84 → 2089.84] Our life, all of it?
[2089.84 → 2096.84] Your Son took your righteous wrath in its fullness that we might choose eternity with you.
[2096.84 → 2102.84] O God, we are a wicked people and have rebelled, turning away from your commands.
[2102.84 → 2111.84] And yet, your deep, deep love, vast, unmeasured, boundless, free, awaits our wayward hearts.
[2111.84 → 2119.84] The current of your love tearing us from our sin and our hold on the world, replacing our desires heavenward.
[2119.84 → 2121.84] Lead us on, O Lord.
[2126.84 → 2155.84] O the deep, deep love of Jesus, vast, unmeasured, boundless, free,
[2155.84 → 2157.84] O the deep, deep love of Jesus, vast, unmeasured, boundless, free,
[2157.84 → 2172.84] Rolling as a mighty ocean in its fullness over me.
[2172.84 → 2188.84] Underneath me, all around me, is the current of thy love.
[2188.84 → 2205.84] Leading onward, leading homeward, leading homeward, to thy glorious rest above.
[2205.84 → 2223.84] O the deep, deep love of Jesus, spread His praise from shore to shore.
[2223.84 → 2239.84] How He loves us, ever loves us, changes never, nevermore.
[2239.84 → 2256.84] How He watches for His loved ones, died to call them all His own.
[2256.84 → 2274.84] How for them, He's interceding, washes on them from the throne.
[2274.84 → 2294.04] O the deep, deep love of Jesus, love of every love the best.
[2294.04 → 2303.04] This an ocean, vast of blessing.
[2303.04 → 2304.04] This an ocean, vast of blessing.
[2304.04 → 2312.04] This a haven, sweet of rest.
[2312.04 → 2323.04] Oh, the deep, deep love of Jesus.
[2323.04 → 2330.04] This a haven, of heaven, too high.
[2330.04 → 2346.14] And it lifts me up to glory, for it lifts me up to thee.
[2348.88 → 2350.16] You may be seated.
[2359.00 → 2359.84] Good morning.
[2361.04 → 2364.78] Today's special offering is for Cascade Christian Counselling.
[2365.30 → 2369.96] It's a non-profit organization that's been in operation for over 35 years.
[2370.56 → 2376.64] They offer a caring, faith-based approach to helping clients move towards healing.
[2377.48 → 2384.42] They exist to provide psychologically valid Christian counselling and counselling services
[2384.42 → 2386.26] to the whole community.
[2386.26 → 2393.24] We raise funds in order to provide lower session fees to those who can't afford to get the help they need.
[2393.46 → 2393.80] Thank you.
[2393.80 → 2401.54] Thank you.
[2401.54 → 2402.54] Thank you.

[2412.54 → 2413.54] Thank you.
[2413.54 → 2414.54] Thank you.
[2414.54 → 2415.54] Thank you.
[2415.54 → 2416.54] Thank you.
[2416.54 → 2417.54] Thank you.
[2417.54 → 2418.54] Thank you.
[2418.54 → 2419.54] Thank you.
[2419.54 → 2420.54] Thank you.
[2420.54 → 2421.54] Thank you.
[2421.54 → 2422.54] Thank you.
[2422.54 → 2423.54] Thank you.
[2423.54 → 2428.70] You are my hiding place.
[2429.42 → 2439.38] You always fill my heart with songs of deliverance.
[2439.38 → 2447.00] Whenever I am afraid, I will trust in you.
[2449.06 → 2453.30] I will trust in you.
[2453.54 → 2466.78] Let the weak say I am strong in the strength of the Lord.
[2467.12 → 2469.54] I will trust in you.
[2469.54 → 2475.14] You are my hiding place.
[2475.14 → 2485.14] You always fill my heart with songs of deliverance.
[2485.14 → 2493.14] Whenever I am afraid, I will trust in you.
[2493.14 → 2499.14] I will trust in you.
[2499.14 → 2512.16] Let the weak say I am strong in the strength of the Lord.
[2512.16 → 2514.16] I will trust in you.
[2514.16 → 2519.16] I will trust in you.
[2519.16 → 2523.16] I will trust in you.
[2523.16 → 2535.16] Let the weak say I am strong in the strength of the Lord.
[2535.16 → 2540.16] I will trust in you.
[2540.16 → 2544.18] Let the weak say I am strong
[2544.18 → 2552.98] All right.
[2553.16 → 2557.18] If we can get all the children up here this morning for the children's blessing that would
[2557.18 → 2558.46] Come on up, kids.
[2573.42 → 2575.20] How's everybody doing this morning?
[2575.70 → 2577.42] Who likes the sunshine out there?
[2577.84 → 2578.32] Yeah?
[2579.28 → 2581.70] Anybody going to go outside and play in the park today maybe?
[2582.18 → 2582.44] Yeah?
[2582.58 → 2583.50] It's going to be cool and fun?
[2584.14 → 2584.40] Yeah?
[2584.82 → 2585.52] That's good.
[2585.52 → 2585.68] Okay.
[2586.84 → 2589.36] How many of you kids are going to school already?
[2589.96 → 2590.22] Yeah?
[2590.44 → 2590.66] Yeah?
[2591.90 → 2592.22] Yeah?
[2592.78 → 2593.86] Has it been a good start?
[2593.92 → 2594.44] Has it been fun?
[2594.94 → 2595.30] Yeah?
[2595.44 → 2596.88] Better than being at home all summer?
[2598.68 → 2600.06] Not so sure about that one.
[2600.18 → 2600.46] Okay.
[2602.12 → 2607.22] We are, so just the preschoolers have children's worship time this morning.
[2607.32 → 2609.20] So what we're going to do right now is we're going to do the blessing.
[2609.28 → 2610.22] You guys know how to do the blessing?
[2610.64 → 2613.26] I know usually a lot of the older kids here and help you out, but do you think you guys
[2613.26 → 2613.80] can do this?
[2613.80 → 2614.62] Help me out?
[2614.62 → 2618.08] Because my memory's not so good, so you're going to have to help me out with this one.
[2618.56 → 2619.06] Should we do that?
[2619.18 → 2619.42] Okay.
[2619.56 → 2620.44] Everybody stand up.
[2622.46 → 2624.04] We're going to face the congregation.
[2624.24 → 2624.78] Turn that way.
[2625.54 → 2626.44] Put your hands out.
[2626.44 → 2629.86] The Lord be with you.
[2629.86 → 2631.50] And all of you.
[2631.50 → 2644.42] All right.
[2644.42 → 2644.44] All right.
[2644.50 → 2650.04] As the children are exiting the room here, I'm just going to, we had a council meeting
[2650.04 → 2651.04] this week.
[2651.04 → 2654.30] So I thought it's a good time this morning to share some of the council notes that are
[2654.30 → 2658.62] summaries that summary of what we were talking about and what we were up to this week at
[2658.62 → 2659.64] our first council meeting.
[2659.64 → 2666.10] It was our first council meeting of the season, so it was great to be able to welcome new council
[2666.10 → 2672.42] members, those that were affirmed in the summer and have them with us for their first meeting.
[2673.42 → 2678.06] Pastor Chris did a little training session at the beginning of the meeting talking about
[2678.06 → 2683.00] what our roles and responsibilities are as elders, deacons, and as council members.
[2683.00 → 2690.18] We also spent quite a bit of time talking about the town hall meeting that we had a few weeks
[2690.18 → 2692.46] back pertaining to the young adult position.
[2693.32 → 2698.52] So we felt that that meeting, that town hall went really well, and we were encouraged by that
[2698.52 → 2698.88] evening.
[2700.46 → 2705.82] On October 2nd, we're going to have a special general meeting after the service to vote on
[2705.82 → 2707.66] the young adult ministry position.
[2707.90 → 2710.98] So make sure you put that in your calendar.
[2710.98 → 2716.48] In your emails this morning, I think it went out about 9.30, the package for the young
[2716.48 → 2721.42] adult position that we're proposing is all in there, all the information is there.
[2721.52 → 2726.94] If there's anything you want to know or have any questions, the town hall meeting was videoed
[2726.94 → 2731.02] and there's a link in the package, and you can watch that.
[2731.70 → 2733.40] It's good to see, good to watch.
[2735.84 → 2737.34] I also want to thank Josh.
[2737.42 → 2738.94] We didn't really have a is Josh here this morning?
[2739.00 → 2739.28] There he is.
[2739.28 → 2740.66] We want to thank Josh this morning.
[2740.78 → 2746.86] Like, we, we just want to thank him for the work he did in the past couple of years with
[2746.86 → 2747.76] the young adult position.
[2747.90 → 2751.88] It was pretty evident at the town hall meeting that the work he's been doing is very valuable
[2751.88 → 2754.48] and the young adults here really appreciate the work he's done.
[2754.60 → 2756.24] So we want to thank Josh for that.
[2756.24 → 2764.66] I bet you weren't expecting that applause, but hey, everybody likes you.
[2764.66 → 2765.08] That's good.
[2765.08 → 2770.52] I just want to let you guys know, I know this is something that's been a lot on your mind
[2770.52 → 2771.40] that's been mentioned to me.
[2771.46 → 2774.08] We did have an opportunity this summer to do staff review.
[2774.20 → 2775.44] So a lot of that work's been done.
[2775.50 → 2778.30] Over COVID, we didn't, there wasn't a lot of great opportunity to do that.
[2778.36 → 2779.90] So we've made that a priority this year.
[2780.44 → 2781.44] So that's all been done.
[2781.50 → 2784.12] So there's going to be some recommendations coming from that.
[2784.12 → 2789.62] And the last thing I want to say is that for many of you who are involved in ministries,
[2789.80 → 2795.12] that there's a your budget requests have to be in on the 6th.
[2796.40 → 2796.80] ASAP.
[2797.86 → 2799.04] ASAP, like yesterday.
[2799.58 → 2802.70] So if you get that in as soon as possible to Sylvia, that would be fantastic.
[2802.90 → 2803.24] Thank you.
[2814.12 → 2818.30] My name's Peter Van Heuser.
[2819.36 → 2821.44] I'm going to lead you in congregational prayer.
[2821.54 → 2826.40] Before I do that, I just want to draw attention that Wendy Piquet,
[2826.62 → 2830.38] who's sitting at the back of the church there somewhere, maybe you could wave Wendy.
[2830.96 → 2833.30] She's been worshipping with us for a couple of years,
[2833.30 → 2838.38] and she leaves this week, Friday, for Season, closer to her daughter.
[2838.68 → 2840.98] But we've enjoyed having her worship with us,
[2841.04 → 2843.58] and she assures me she's certainly enjoyed our fellowship.
[2844.98 → 2852.10] Today, this week, we also marked a three-year anniversary of the Mural family coming to us.
[2852.18 → 2858.58] Maybe you could just stand for a moment there, just so that we just want to acknowledge three years.
[2858.58 → 2858.92] Yeah.
[2862.12 → 2867.46] And Hail in the middle there, she graduated from high school, and she's going to Angara.
[2867.74 → 2869.26] So we are very excited.
[2869.26 → 2879.62] This coming week on the 19th will have been five years that the Agile family came to us,
[2879.84 → 2881.20] and so we're thankful to them.
[2881.30 → 2887.56] They also passed their citizenship test, and so they'll soon be receiving their citizenship,
[2887.84 → 2892.00] so they've played a big role in our committee's life as well.
[2892.34 → 2893.48] I'll lead you in prayer now.
[2893.48 → 2897.14] Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be your name.
[2898.00 → 2902.58] Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[2903.34 → 2910.34] We thank you for this day and this opportunity to come to you in our church family prayer.
[2910.34 → 2919.06] We give you praise that through the sacrifice of Jesus, we have access to your forgiveness and empowerment through the work of the Holy Spirit.
[2920.20 → 2927.74] You encourage us to pray, and where words fail, your spirit enables even the most simple of words,
[2928.12 → 2935.42] in whatever language we may use, to express our love, our fears, and our concerns to you.
[2935.42 → 2940.82] This beautiful morning, we are reminded that life looks so good.
[2941.58 → 2943.46] Our barns are full of grain.
[2944.18 → 2946.16] The harvest looks good this September.
[2947.00 → 2949.46] Our bank accounts for most of us are healthy.
[2950.44 → 2954.36] Although inflation makes it hard for those on the margins in our community,
[2954.96 → 2961.06] we have our deacons, the food bank, and the gateway of hope to ensure no one goes hungry.
[2961.06 → 2968.96] Yet painful reminders that not all is well stalks our communities, province, and nation.
[2969.86 → 2974.40] All our efforts at trying to solve the drug crisis seems to fall flat.
[2975.48 → 2977.92] Gangs stalk our streets and shoot to kill.
[2978.68 → 2982.20] Our medical resources are stretched to the breaking point.
[2983.10 → 2986.38] Mental health concerns seem to be ever more present today.
[2986.38 → 2991.28] Marriages fail, and family conflict can be ever present.
[2992.34 → 2996.32] Faith in God and in faithful commitment to the church seems waning.
[2997.04 → 2998.70] The list goes on and on.
[2999.66 → 3000.76] What is one to do?
[3001.68 → 3004.68] We lay these concerns at your feet, O Holy Father.
[3005.52 → 3009.76] Provide our church family with the love, the counsel, and the leadership
[3009.76 → 3016.86] to help each other discern the times we are living in and to keep our focus on Jesus.
[3019.42 → 3022.94] Yet we rejoice that there is something we can do.
[3023.60 → 3027.02] And as a church, we are thankful for the ministries that we offer.
[3028.06 → 3034.94] Five years ago, September 19, the Agile family came to our community, sponsored by our church.
[3034.94 → 3040.70] Three years ago, the Murals, on September the 16th, they were refugees,
[3041.38 → 3044.62] and our sponsorship provided a way out of a horrible situation.
[3045.64 → 3049.84] Today, we are ready to sponsor another family, the Never family of four,
[3050.42 → 3054.10] whose sponsorship through World Renew we entrust to your providence.
[3054.98 → 3061.84] This morning, our lobby will provide a space where ministry opportunities will speak to places where we can volunteer.
[3061.84 → 3070.04] We thank you that this church is a place where anyone can do something to carry out the mission of our church.
[3070.76 → 3077.04] The church can show and direct each other so that we may have confidence in moving forward,
[3077.14 → 3079.46] regardless of the challenges we may face.
[3080.82 → 3085.74] These past ten days, we've been reflecting on the life work of Queen Elizabeth.
[3085.74 → 3094.66] We thank you for her witness of you, her true sovereign, and her example of daily faithfulness and service.
[3095.58 → 3101.08] History shows that there were many monarchs who were despots and had huge moral failings.
[3101.68 → 3106.46] But we are thankful that our queen has not been a failure, but graceful and loving.
[3107.18 → 3111.76] We thank you for her seven years of service to her country and also to ours.
[3111.76 → 3118.48] We pray the new king, Charles III, will acknowledge you and rule with a desire to serve.
[3119.98 → 3126.66] In grieving the loss of the queen, many speak of how this event also triggers for them memories of those who have passed away.
[3127.74 → 3132.58] Some too soon, we could say, Dave Alexander and Louise Rezones,
[3133.06 → 3136.46] but others later in life who have shaped our hearts and minds.
[3136.46 → 3141.08] Rich Demons is coming back after being present for her mom's funeral.
[3142.00 → 3145.56] We all have memories of loved ones who have gone before us.
[3146.32 → 3151.50] Remind us each day, Lord, that our times are in your hands.
[3152.46 → 3158.76] We continue to hear news from Ukraine that is encouraging, but also brutal,
[3159.24 → 3162.70] in seeing how destructive and inhumane mankind can be.
[3162.70 → 3166.04] We long to see peace between Ukraine and Russia.
[3166.92 → 3171.54] We know that from the human heart can come the most despicable atrocities.
[3172.38 → 3174.56] How long, Lord, must this go on?
[3175.40 → 3177.90] Even the environment seems out of control.
[3178.72 → 3182.10] We had our floods last November, and now it's Pakistan's turn.
[3182.10 → 3187.60] Every year, there's another corner of the world that takes it in the chin with either a flood,
[3188.22 → 3193.10] a fire, drought, pestilent tornado, or an earthquake.
[3194.18 → 3200.44] Reminders that the creation groans and that it awaits the day of salvation, as we do.
[3201.38 → 3204.36] May our actions treat our creation with respect
[3204.36 → 3209.90] and mitigate through our lifestyle choices the care our natural environment craves.
[3210.80 → 3213.90] We thank you, our Father, for listening to us.
[3214.68 → 3216.38] Hear our prayers, O Lord.
[3217.08 → 3219.04] Incline your ear to us.
[3219.80 → 3224.68] We desire to grow more deeply into your presence and providence.
[3225.36 → 3227.04] In Jesus' name we pray.
[3227.70 → 3228.06] Amen.
[3228.06 → 3228.18] Amen.
[3234.36 → 3236.36] Amen.
[3256.36 → 3263.84] During the month of September, we are in a beginning of the year,
[3263.84 → 3267.98] a new ministry year series called This Is Our Church.
[3268.08 → 3270.52] And we are looking at who we are.
[3270.84 → 3274.58] And as I was reflecting on that this morning, I was reminded of it.
[3275.14 → 3277.52] I just want to say thank you and bless you.
[3278.24 → 3281.50] Because this is one of those mornings where it was really clear to me
[3281.50 → 3284.56] that one of the things we are is a church that loves to sing.
[3285.62 → 3287.48] And so singing this morning was great.
[3287.60 → 3289.28] And thank you for blessing me with that.
[3289.36 → 3290.78] I hope that you were blessed.
[3290.78 → 3294.42] And we will have a chance to do that again following our worship.
[3294.48 → 3298.62] I was also reminded this morning as Marguerite came up and as Peter reminded us
[3298.62 → 3300.60] that we are a church that's doing things.
[3301.16 → 3301.26] Right?
[3301.30 → 3302.88] That there are things happening here.
[3302.96 → 3306.32] We are a church that longs for the safety of your kids as they come.
[3306.42 → 3308.60] And so we have safe church ministries, which is important.
[3308.72 → 3311.58] We are a church that has sponsored refugees in the past.
[3311.58 → 3316.78] And if you didn't catch it in the prayer, there is some good news coming out of the refugee sponsorship team
[3316.78 → 3321.44] that we do have another family that we've committed to and are in process of.
[3321.52 → 3324.60] And so Peter will give you details of that if you want and ask him.
[3324.70 → 3326.58] He's going to be in the back following service.
[3326.98 → 3331.94] And we've got all of those things back there for you to sign up and see and to engage in.
[3331.94 → 3342.30] It is a beautiful testimony of God at work in us and of you at work in the world for him.
[3342.30 → 3347.54] As we reflect this morning on what we do and why we do it,
[3347.68 → 3353.54] it's loosely in these three weeks around the mission statement of our church,
[3353.62 → 3360.54] which you may know is gather, grow, and go.
[3361.08 → 3365.48] The exuberance on you all this morning is just spilling forward.
[3366.82 → 3368.92] Gather, grow, and go.
[3368.92 → 3370.50] Last week we looked at gather.
[3370.50 → 3373.50] This week we're looking at the question of grow.
[3373.82 → 3378.24] And more particularly, why and how do we grow?
[3378.96 → 3386.00] Now I was reminded this past summer that sometimes growth is incredibly visible.
[3387.08 → 3389.28] So I have a daughter, she's nine years old.
[3389.96 → 3395.74] And we went this summer back to Ontario where we were from to visit family and friends.
[3395.74 → 3402.88] And my daughter in the last year has grown like a foot and four or five shoe sizes.
[3403.66 → 3411.02] It is impossible to keep her in clothes for longer than one or two months, it seems.
[3411.12 → 3412.24] And then she has to get new clothes.
[3412.32 → 3413.22] Now she loves that.
[3414.62 → 3416.18] The laundry pile does not.
[3416.18 → 3418.40] I heard her just say now from the back, yes, see?
[3420.90 → 3425.56] And when we went to visit people, they were blown away.
[3426.28 → 3429.98] Oh my, Nora, look how big you've gotten, they would say.
[3430.54 → 3433.38] Now, sometimes growth is visible too.
[3433.50 → 3436.82] And I'm going to say this as well, rather to my own shame.
[3436.82 → 3439.62] But my little niece, who's four, sat in my lap.
[3439.72 → 3442.74] She poked me in this tummy and said, my, look how you've grown.
[3446.46 → 3447.96] She's five now, thank you.
[3449.54 → 3451.32] Point is, sometimes you can see it.
[3452.72 → 3457.36] Sometimes growth is slower, and it's longer term.
[3457.36 → 3462.72] And it takes an intentionality to see when it's happening.
[3463.48 → 3470.20] And yet, we believe that growth has to be happening.
[3470.82 → 3474.88] And so this morning, as we look at how we grow and how we are grown,
[3475.16 → 3480.30] we will see both visible and invisible markers of that growth.
[3480.72 → 3484.18] We're going to do that by looking at a text from Ephesians 4.
[3484.18 → 3487.42] So if you have a Bible, I'm going to encourage you to open that up.
[3488.10 → 3489.82] We'll turn to Ephesians 4.
[3490.30 → 3493.22] For those of you who are new or maybe have not paid attention before,
[3493.30 → 3495.68] but if you look at the screen, when you see the text,
[3495.76 → 3497.22] and that little graph along the bottom,
[3497.92 → 3503.06] that tells you approximately where in your Bible the text we're reading from is.
[3503.34 → 3505.16] So if you're unfamiliar with Bibles,
[3505.48 → 3509.12] and you see Ephesians is kind of in the latter, you know, fifth over there,
[3509.16 → 3511.94] if you open up to the back fifth, you'll be pretty close to where you can find it.
[3511.94 → 3514.80] So just a little, maybe you've never paid attention to that.
[3515.00 → 3521.12] Anyway, Ephesians 4, I'm going to read verse 11 through 16.
[3521.46 → 3524.94] That will be on the screen, but I do always encourage you to have it in your hands
[3524.94 → 3527.26] because we will refer back pretty regularly.
[3528.30 → 3531.28] So God's Word for us this morning.
[3531.28 → 3540.24] So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors, and teachers
[3540.24 → 3546.52] to equip his people for works of service so that the body of Christ may be built up
[3546.52 → 3551.46] until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God
[3551.46 → 3557.08] and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.
[3557.08 → 3562.98] Then we will no longer be infants tossed back and forth by the waves
[3562.98 → 3565.54] and blown here and there by every wind of teaching
[3565.54 → 3569.50] and by the cunning and craftiness of people in their deceitful scheming.
[3570.72 → 3573.90] Instead, speaking the truth in love,
[3574.32 → 3580.90] we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head that is Christ.
[3580.90 → 3587.64] From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament,
[3588.00 → 3593.90] grows and builds itself up in love as each part does its work.
[3594.36 → 3595.58] This is the Word of the Lord.
[3599.52 → 3606.66] Now this morning we're going to draw our application from the second half of the text that we read,
[3606.66 → 3611.18] but in order to get there, I'm going to walk us through the first part as we go.
[3615.08 → 3621.74] Now as I mentioned, the big question for us this September has been, who are we?
[3622.44 → 3627.10] As a church, what are we about, and why do we do it the way that we do it?
[3628.10 → 3632.82] In a very real way, these couple weeks at the beginning of this ministry year,
[3632.82 → 3635.14] we are saying, this is us.
[3635.98 → 3636.96] This is our church.
[3637.06 → 3641.14] This is who we are and who we are becoming, Lord willing.
[3642.46 → 3647.30] And so, in this text, let's start with the foundation.
[3648.04 → 3653.10] In verse 11, Paul, who wrote this letter to the church, he writes,
[3653.44 → 3660.26] So Christ himself gave the apostles and the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors, and the teachers.
[3660.26 → 3666.30] Now the first thing to see here is that it is Christ himself, right?
[3666.48 → 3669.82] The foundation is Christ himself.
[3670.22 → 3675.52] Christ himself gave the apostles and the teachers and the pastors.
[3675.74 → 3676.94] Christ himself gave.
[3677.02 → 3682.58] It starts with Jesus, and then, hold that in your mind, looking at verse 12, right?
[3682.58 → 3692.84] But, to equip his people for works of service so that the body of Christ may be built up until we reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature.
[3693.20 → 3694.14] Hear this last line.
[3694.68 → 3699.44] Attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.
[3701.54 → 3705.46] It starts with Jesus, and it ends with Jesus.
[3706.86 → 3709.10] He is the beginning and the end.
[3709.10 → 3716.94] He is the Alpha and the Omega, or as the author to Hebrews puts it, he is the author and finisher of our faith.
[3717.28 → 3721.14] We're starting in him, ending up like him.
[3723.10 → 3737.30] Now, I make this point because sometimes churches have worked really hard, or church leaders, particularly pastors, have worked really hard to build a church around the personality of the leader.
[3737.30 → 3746.48] Now, that's not us, and may God forbid that ever becomes us, and if you see me tending in that direction, stop me.
[3747.80 → 3748.90] Hold me accountable.
[3750.96 → 3758.08] And sometimes, right, churches are built around a particular tradition or a particular expression of a tradition.
[3758.08 → 3762.22] Time out.
[3763.18 → 3766.00] Let's pause, because I believe tradition is good.
[3767.00 → 3769.82] If you know me, you know that I have a university degree in history.
[3770.26 → 3774.70] Last week, in our celebration of the Lord's Supper, we used a 2,000-year-old liturgy.
[3775.54 → 3784.64] This morning's service, beautifully crafted by Sarah, was structured around the Apostles' Creed, a 1,500 to 1,800-year-old statement of faith.
[3784.64 → 3795.86] Right, tradition is important, but tradition functions well when it is the firm foundation off of which we can step confidently into the future.
[3796.82 → 3807.42] If all we are doing is looking into the past with rose-coloured glasses, and we decry the loss of the good old days, remember when?
[3807.42 → 3811.86] If that's our focus, it's actually in the wrong direction.
[3813.42 → 3816.94] To paraphrase Yaroslav Pelican, he says,
[3817.06 → 3819.74] Tradition is the living faith of the dead.
[3819.94 → 3822.82] Traditionalism is the dead faith of the living.
[3824.46 → 3828.18] Dead faith in churches results in dead churches.
[3828.18 → 3838.14] Instead, we start and finish with a Jesus who is alive.
[3840.00 → 3842.72] And so our faith is alive.
[3844.56 → 3852.14] Now, sometimes as well, churches will identify themselves by a particular ethnic identity.
[3852.14 → 3860.10] Now, some people in our neighbourhood around here, right, will call this the Dutch church beside the school.
[3862.10 → 3865.62] Some of you laugh, and you hear that, and some of you are like, yeah, it is.
[3867.18 → 3870.62] Some of you still think that way and take pride in that way.
[3870.84 → 3874.04] And don't get me wrong, again, this is one of those don't hear what I'm not saying moments, right?
[3874.04 → 3886.50] Especially for first wave immigrants into a new country, having your church family feel like a family is so important for your thriving and surviving in a totally new country.
[3887.84 → 3899.84] But, and I really believe this to be true, the future of the Christian church in the West is multi-ethnic because the current reality of the West is multi-ethnic.
[3899.84 → 3904.08] And so if our churches aren't, we've missed something.
[3906.44 → 3911.52] Jesus is gathering a bride from every tribe and tongue and nation.
[3911.68 → 3918.70] And if we are focused on Jesus, we will begin to manifest every tribe and tongue and nation already now.
[3920.12 → 3921.12] And I was thinking about this.
[3921.20 → 3927.16] In my two years here, I have spoken more Spanish or Korean from this stage than I have ever spoken Dutch.
[3927.16 → 3931.48] And so why is there this reputation that persists?
[3934.50 → 3941.32] Sometimes churches are built on a particular social need or a particular justice ministry.
[3941.62 → 3943.54] And again, don't hear what I'm not saying, right?
[3943.62 → 3949.16] Churches, and more specifically Christians, need and must, what does the prophet Micah say?
[3949.40 → 3952.58] Love, mercy, act justly, and walk humbly with our God.
[3952.58 → 3952.98] Right?
[3953.02 → 3958.18] In relationship to and in service with disenfranchised people and marginalized people.
[3958.54 → 3967.10] A comprehensive vision of the gospel, including both the king and his kingdom come and coming, will do that for us.
[3968.46 → 3977.52] But it can easily happen that people, even those of us who profess to be Christian, want the kingdom without the king.
[3977.52 → 3978.52] Right?
[3980.32 → 3983.64] We want the good without the need for a saviour.
[3985.94 → 3993.66] Now, the primary task of the church, right, is to open and close the kingdom of heaven with the keys that God has given us.
[3993.70 → 3996.64] And those keys are preaching and church discipline.
[3996.86 → 4002.44] And so, yes and amen, we have a refugee sponsorship team and they are doing amazing work.
[4002.44 → 4009.24] Yes and amen, we have food drives, and we do food drives, and we send people out on service trips, and we must do these things.
[4009.54 → 4015.12] But they cannot become the main thing, or at least the only thing, that the church does.
[4016.24 → 4017.74] We aren't designed for that.
[4019.46 → 4022.42] Now, as individuals, you are.
[4024.18 → 4025.08] Let me put it this way.
[4025.08 → 4031.28] The mission of the gathered church is different from the mission of the scattered church.
[4032.76 → 4037.88] But they work together towards the goal of our maturity.
[4039.08 → 4042.08] In fact, that's the point of this text in Ephesians.
[4042.74 → 4043.08] Right?
[4043.20 → 4048.00] We read Christ himself gave, so he is the foundation, right, and the goal.
[4048.12 → 4049.26] He is the foundation.
[4049.42 → 4054.38] Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors, and the teachers.
[4054.38 → 4058.50] And notice that those are specifically church offices.
[4060.02 → 4070.86] Apostles refers to the 12 disciples of Jesus after Matthias was added to replace Judas, after he betrayed Jesus.
[4071.84 → 4077.60] Apostles can refer to Paul and Timothy and Silvanus, who is also known as Silas.
[4077.86 → 4080.82] Apostles can refer to Barnabas and Titus.
[4080.82 → 4088.26] Maybe, Apostles refers to Androids and Julia, depending on how you interpret the Greek of Romans 16.
[4088.70 → 4091.24] We can have a special pastor's class for that after, if you're interested.
[4092.00 → 4095.90] Point is, it's a particular office for particular people.
[4096.42 → 4097.24] Likewise, prophets.
[4097.58 → 4104.18] In the New Testament era, prophets refers to a group of people who are associated with the apostles,
[4104.18 → 4108.84] who usually travelled with them or would be established wherever they ended up.
[4109.16 → 4112.08] And they would sometimes speak the future in prophecy.
[4112.32 → 4114.06] That's the way we commonly use the word.
[4114.40 → 4123.20] But most often, they would gather to speak and encourage and strengthen and rebuke and hold to account believers at their particular gatherings.
[4123.20 → 4131.50] Evangelists, again, we can trace this through the book of Acts and into early church history,
[4132.04 → 4138.66] refers to those people who went around the known world as missionaries, but who weren't apostles.
[4140.34 → 4146.12] And then we get pastors and teachers, which is maybe one we're more familiar with in our everyday language.
[4146.12 → 4153.90] Pastors and teachers here is a word pairing, and the word translated pastor is actually shepherded.
[4155.84 → 4162.92] Now, Peter says that it's the elders of the church who are to be shepherds of God's flock that is under their care.
[4163.76 → 4168.72] And so I, as a pastor here, am one of the elders in this church.
[4168.86 → 4174.08] Pastor Kevin is an elder here, and so are seven other men who have been called by God
[4174.08 → 4177.28] and installed into that position here in the work that we do.
[4178.30 → 4180.90] And so, follow the logic of this text.
[4181.96 → 4187.60] Christ himself, as the foundation and goal, gave these specific offices,
[4188.30 → 4191.44] plus others that are not mentioned in this text, right, like deacons,
[4192.24 → 4199.64] and he gave specific gifts, like prophecy or tongues or teaching or giving or hospitality,
[4199.64 → 4207.02] to equip his people for works of service.
[4208.92 → 4212.92] About that, works of service, notice two things.
[4213.02 → 4218.36] First, Jesus is the one equipping, right?
[4218.42 → 4223.06] The specific offices, whatever they are, are offices of means.
[4223.44 → 4226.44] That is, they're through whom Jesus is working.
[4226.44 → 4229.24] Jesus gives and causes the growth.
[4229.70 → 4232.48] That's why Paul will say in 1 Corinthians 3,
[4232.94 → 4236.92] one plants, one waters, God gives the growth, right?
[4237.00 → 4241.16] Jesus equips his people by using his people.
[4243.02 → 4246.38] And so now, in the big question, right, of why grow,
[4246.92 → 4250.32] the first answer is, because Jesus is growing us.
[4250.32 → 4250.96] Right?
[4251.68 → 4258.14] Draw near to Jesus, become part of his body, and you will grow and be grown.
[4258.40 → 4260.84] It's unavoidable.
[4262.58 → 4267.00] And somehow, if you manage to avoid growing,
[4269.22 → 4273.88] and you've been a Christian, or at least you've been attending church for a really long time,
[4273.88 → 4277.66] the question you need to be asking yourself right now is,
[4279.04 → 4281.84] why am I holding Jesus at arm's length?
[4283.70 → 4286.62] Because when you're close to him, you grow.
[4288.28 → 4289.98] Now, it might be slow, right?
[4290.82 → 4292.08] It might be incremental.
[4292.66 → 4298.14] It might be almost impossible to notice at the moment that you find yourself right now.
[4298.14 → 4301.32] But over the course of a lifetime, it will be clear.
[4301.52 → 4303.52] Because Christians grow.
[4304.38 → 4308.98] We are constantly being transformed by the renewal of our minds
[4308.98 → 4312.54] and the power of the Holy Spirit into the image of Jesus Christ.
[4312.92 → 4317.80] This is the work that God is doing in you and through you right now, right here.
[4318.08 → 4321.34] And this is the work that we, together, get to witness
[4321.34 → 4324.98] and to be part of in church life together.
[4324.98 → 4328.78] And second, notice,
[4330.08 → 4335.62] Christ gave to equip the saints, his people, for works of service.
[4336.44 → 4339.92] That phrase, works of service, is fascinating.
[4341.14 → 4346.66] First, all the offices, all the leadership, all the direction,
[4346.92 → 4349.24] all the discipleship, all the pouring into,
[4349.64 → 4351.30] all the preaching and teaching,
[4351.30 → 4354.86] all the opening and closing of the kingdom of heaven through the keys,
[4354.98 → 4357.54] all the gathering that we do,
[4357.82 → 4361.26] is to equip his people for works of service.
[4362.44 → 4368.20] That word, service, that Paul uses here in Greek is the word diatonic,
[4369.08 → 4372.26] which maybe sounds like a word we're more familiar with here
[4372.26 → 4374.18] because that's where we get the word deacon from.
[4375.68 → 4378.82] Now, a deacon, someone who serves,
[4378.82 → 4381.06] the word literally means servant.
[4382.34 → 4387.20] Specifically, in the New Testament, it is a table servant, right?
[4387.20 → 4392.24] Someone who brings and provides food for those who are reclining at the table.
[4393.32 → 4394.38] And so, here in that, right,
[4394.42 → 4398.32] that the life of the Christian who is growing in his or her faith
[4398.32 → 4400.66] is a life of servanthood to Christ
[4400.66 → 4403.10] and a life of service in Christ.
[4403.10 → 4406.88] And so, the question really is, for you this morning,
[4407.08 → 4409.30] what is your area of service?
[4409.98 → 4411.48] Where are you serving?
[4412.14 → 4416.18] Because growth and serving go hand in glove together.
[4417.14 → 4417.58] Right?
[4417.60 → 4420.18] If you're looking to grow, then practice service.
[4421.04 → 4422.64] If you want to grow in your faith,
[4422.78 → 4425.84] exercise that faith in service to the people around you,
[4425.88 → 4427.48] whether they're here in our church community
[4427.48 → 4429.42] or broader in our neighbourhood community.
[4429.42 → 4431.86] If you want to grow in your faith,
[4433.12 → 4434.98] consider signing up after the service,
[4435.92 → 4437.32] right, to be a GEMS counsellor.
[4438.10 → 4441.90] Or, if you're a young girl, to participate in the GEMS program.
[4442.76 → 4447.02] Consider signing up after the service to be a sound or media technician
[4447.02 → 4450.30] or to volunteer or to join up into a small group.
[4451.16 → 4453.22] One of the ways you grow,
[4453.36 → 4456.48] one of the ways that you are grown as Jesus does this work,
[4456.48 → 4459.96] is not just by Bible studies and by coffee break,
[4460.06 → 4460.94] both of which are awesome,
[4461.12 → 4463.40] and you have opportunities to sign up for both of those
[4463.40 → 4464.94] after service today, too.
[4465.90 → 4470.12] But it's by helping in the nursery that you are grown.
[4470.60 → 4474.04] It's by volunteering for kitchen cleanup after coffee
[4474.04 → 4475.34] that you are grown.
[4475.34 → 4480.56] And then finally, in this first section,
[4482.80 → 4486.36] Christ, as the foundation and the goal,
[4486.50 → 4488.74] has given us these offices and leaders
[4488.74 → 4491.52] in order that we, all his people,
[4491.68 → 4493.38] might be equipped for works of service.
[4493.68 → 4494.66] And we read,
[4497.66 → 4502.46] so that the body of Christ may be built up.
[4505.34 → 4506.58] So I'll say it again.
[4507.76 → 4511.70] Your serving leads to your growing.
[4513.06 → 4513.74] But there's more,
[4514.06 → 4515.46] because there's another way,
[4515.56 → 4516.60] maybe a better way,
[4516.66 → 4518.66] to translate this line here.
[4519.32 → 4520.54] I'm going to read the whole thing again,
[4520.62 → 4523.94] but I'll translate it in my own words here.
[4524.80 → 4526.80] Christ himself gave the apostles,
[4527.02 → 4528.32] the prophets, the evangelists,
[4528.42 → 4529.66] the shepherds and teachers
[4529.66 → 4532.70] to equip his people for works of service,
[4532.70 → 4536.38] that is, to build up the body of Christ,
[4537.12 → 4539.20] until we all reach unity in the faith
[4539.20 → 4541.78] that have the knowledge of the Son of God
[4541.78 → 4542.80] and become mature,
[4543.28 → 4544.70] attaining to the whole measure
[4544.70 → 4546.38] of the fullness of Christ.
[4546.96 → 4548.24] Did you catch the difference?
[4549.50 → 4551.94] To equip his people for works of service,
[4551.94 → 4555.30] that is, to build up the body of Christ.
[4555.30 → 4557.92] What Paul is saying here
[4557.92 → 4561.24] is that the works of service
[4561.24 → 4563.74] that you are being equipped for
[4563.74 → 4565.14] is the building up of the body.
[4566.06 → 4567.50] It's not another thing.
[4567.60 → 4568.86] It's not an extra thing.
[4569.06 → 4570.14] It's not an add-on.
[4570.26 → 4571.84] Sometimes we hear messages like this
[4571.84 → 4572.16] and we go,
[4572.50 → 4573.68] oh, really, another thing?
[4574.64 → 4575.68] But that's not what this is.
[4576.00 → 4577.74] This is the building up of the body.
[4577.96 → 4578.72] This is growing.
[4578.94 → 4579.82] This is strengthening.
[4580.20 → 4581.24] This is discipleship.
[4581.34 → 4582.40] This is the transformation
[4582.40 → 4584.08] that has been promised to you.
[4584.30 → 4585.16] This is the work.
[4585.72 → 4587.74] And it is work that God is doing
[4587.74 → 4589.52] in you and through you
[4589.52 → 4590.44] and in our midst.
[4591.32 → 4592.98] And it's work that you are called to.
[4593.68 → 4593.80] Right?
[4593.90 → 4596.24] Everyone who professes to believe.
[4598.84 → 4600.10] And so the end of which,
[4600.30 → 4601.56] the goal of which,
[4601.70 → 4603.08] the tells of which,
[4603.80 → 4606.10] is that we all might become mature,
[4607.30 → 4608.88] attaining to the whole measure
[4608.88 → 4611.04] of the fullness of Christ.
[4611.20 → 4614.30] Now, that's a beautiful, poetic language.
[4614.30 → 4616.60] But it's also growth language.
[4618.24 → 4620.50] And I want you to become mature.
[4622.30 → 4624.02] So why grow?
[4625.22 → 4629.04] Because growth means Jesus is real to you.
[4629.46 → 4633.04] Because growth means Jesus is really here in our midst.
[4633.40 → 4635.54] Because growth means something is happening
[4635.54 → 4636.52] in your transformation,
[4636.52 → 4638.24] and that's happening here.
[4638.24 → 4638.92] Right?
[4639.06 → 4640.90] Through us and in you.
[4641.90 → 4645.28] To use another metaphor of Jesus from John 15,
[4645.98 → 4647.96] we grow in the fruit of faith
[4647.96 → 4649.96] because we are genuinely connected
[4649.96 → 4651.38] to the vine,
[4651.50 → 4652.86] who is Jesus.
[4653.52 → 4655.46] If you are connected to the vine,
[4655.46 → 4659.16] it is impossible not to produce fruit.
[4662.46 → 4663.20] And so,
[4663.54 → 4665.26] here we come
[4665.26 → 4666.84] to the heart of the matter.
[4667.68 → 4668.14] Right?
[4668.18 → 4668.88] The application
[4668.88 → 4670.48] of the principle.
[4670.94 → 4672.46] Here we move from why grow
[4672.46 → 4673.76] to how.
[4674.60 → 4675.50] How do I grow?
[4675.50 → 4679.90] Paul writes in verse 14.
[4680.44 → 4681.94] Then we will no longer be infants
[4681.94 → 4683.12] tossed back and forth
[4683.12 → 4683.76] by the waves,
[4684.26 → 4685.34] blown here and there
[4685.34 → 4686.54] by every wind of teaching
[4686.54 → 4687.22] and by the cunning
[4687.22 → 4688.44] and craftiness of people
[4688.44 → 4689.74] in their deceitful scheming.
[4690.34 → 4690.74] Instead,
[4691.06 → 4692.90] speaking the truth in love,
[4693.42 → 4694.74] we will grow to become
[4694.74 → 4695.66] in every respect
[4695.66 → 4696.94] the mature body of him
[4696.94 → 4698.08] who is the head.
[4698.46 → 4699.28] That is Christ.
[4700.16 → 4700.86] From him,
[4700.94 → 4701.62] the whole body,
[4701.74 → 4702.76] joined and held together
[4702.76 → 4704.10] by every supporting ligament,
[4704.10 → 4705.98] grows and builds itself up
[4705.98 → 4706.58] in love
[4706.58 → 4707.90] as each part
[4707.90 → 4709.74] does its work.
[4711.70 → 4712.54] So right now,
[4712.58 → 4713.38] I'm going to suggest
[4713.38 → 4714.54] to you
[4714.54 → 4715.68] a grid
[4715.68 → 4717.78] which we can sort of overlay
[4717.78 → 4719.62] on these verses here
[4719.62 → 4720.92] through which
[4720.92 → 4722.04] we can understand
[4722.04 → 4723.06] this
[4723.06 → 4724.94] how to grow.
[4725.06 → 4726.42] The three steps
[4726.42 → 4727.94] of these verses.
[4728.08 → 4729.02] Now, those three steps
[4729.02 → 4729.66] are one,
[4729.90 → 4730.70] deconstruction,
[4731.16 → 4731.54] two,
[4731.76 → 4732.32] instruction,
[4732.76 → 4733.84] and then three,
[4734.10 → 4735.02] reconstruction.
[4736.64 → 4737.34] So we'll start
[4737.34 → 4737.86] with number one,
[4739.44 → 4740.16] deconstruction.
[4740.72 → 4742.00] Now, you've probably,
[4742.16 → 4743.02] if you've been around here
[4743.02 → 4743.72] for a little while,
[4743.82 → 4744.82] have heard me talk
[4744.82 → 4745.68] about this before,
[4746.28 → 4748.30] but in our culture,
[4748.68 → 4749.44] right now,
[4749.56 → 4752.66] there's a progressive movement
[4752.66 → 4754.32] or some other movement
[4754.32 → 4755.30] away from
[4755.30 → 4757.06] kind of traditional
[4757.06 → 4759.20] orthodox Christian faith
[4759.20 → 4760.38] by people
[4760.38 → 4761.44] who grew up
[4761.44 → 4762.70] in that tradition.
[4762.70 → 4764.94] and these people,
[4765.16 → 4765.26] right,
[4765.30 → 4766.28] not only are they
[4766.28 → 4767.66] claiming no faith
[4767.66 → 4768.94] or a general
[4768.94 → 4770.32] secular creed
[4770.32 → 4771.34] in its place,
[4772.42 → 4773.24] what is happening
[4773.24 → 4774.68] is that they're advocating
[4774.68 → 4775.64] for other people
[4775.64 → 4776.32] to do the same,
[4776.86 → 4777.00] right?
[4777.00 → 4777.94] They're teaching people
[4777.94 → 4778.82] how to leave
[4778.82 → 4779.52] the faith
[4779.52 → 4780.68] that they were raised in.
[4780.76 → 4781.46] They're becoming
[4781.46 → 4782.76] evangelists
[4782.76 → 4784.20] for what is called
[4784.20 → 4785.24] the evangelical
[4785.24 → 4786.60] or the churched.
[4786.60 → 4787.66] Now,
[4787.86 → 4790.42] in this modern movement,
[4790.50 → 4791.26] or maybe it's
[4791.26 → 4792.68] a smaller movement,
[4793.18 → 4794.24] but it's called
[4794.24 → 4795.28] deconstruction.
[4796.12 → 4796.26] Now,
[4797.08 → 4797.80] for those of you
[4797.80 → 4798.28] who have training
[4798.28 → 4799.32] or have read
[4799.32 → 4800.04] some philosophy,
[4800.18 → 4800.80] I want to be clear here,
[4801.06 → 4802.14] this is not the same
[4802.14 → 4803.20] deconstructionism
[4803.20 → 4804.38] of French philosophy
[4804.38 → 4805.66] in the late 20th century
[4805.66 → 4806.36] with people like
[4806.36 → 4806.88] Jacques Derrida,
[4807.44 → 4808.44] although the
[4808.44 → 4809.86] evangelical modern version
[4809.86 → 4810.92] might be
[4810.92 → 4811.50] the sort of
[4811.50 → 4812.36] pop culture fruit
[4812.36 → 4812.84] of that,
[4813.10 → 4813.64] but again,
[4813.68 → 4814.32] we can talk about
[4814.32 → 4814.72] that after.
[4815.78 → 4816.74] The idea here
[4816.74 → 4818.26] is that you
[4818.26 → 4819.38] deconstruct,
[4819.60 → 4820.52] you take apart,
[4820.76 → 4821.70] you disassemble
[4821.70 → 4822.36] the beliefs
[4822.36 → 4823.06] that were handed
[4823.06 → 4823.66] to you.
[4824.44 → 4825.44] Some of their language
[4825.44 → 4826.08] is the beliefs
[4826.08 → 4826.90] that were projected
[4826.90 → 4827.50] to you
[4827.50 → 4828.64] are forced on you
[4828.64 → 4829.68] at a young age.
[4829.82 → 4831.08] You deconstruct them
[4831.08 → 4832.56] in order to cast them off,
[4833.14 → 4834.28] and then what you do
[4834.28 → 4835.20] is you take on
[4835.20 → 4835.68] the modern,
[4835.84 → 4836.22] progressive,
[4836.88 → 4837.98] secular creed.
[4839.90 → 4840.32] Now,
[4840.36 → 4841.16] this is a reality
[4841.16 → 4842.90] that we all find
[4842.90 → 4844.02] ourselves living
[4844.02 → 4844.48] in the midst
[4844.48 → 4845.14] of right now,
[4845.22 → 4845.98] but this is
[4845.98 → 4847.52] particularly important
[4847.52 → 4848.36] of a conversation,
[4848.52 → 4849.22] and particularly
[4849.22 → 4851.02] this is affecting
[4851.02 → 4851.78] those of you
[4851.78 → 4852.58] who are teenagers
[4852.58 → 4853.78] and in your early
[4853.78 → 4854.50] 20s right now,
[4854.56 → 4855.14] because this is all
[4855.14 → 4856.50] over your social
[4856.50 → 4857.06] media world.
[4858.06 → 4858.26] And so,
[4858.34 → 4859.02] especially you,
[4859.22 → 4860.18] I want you to hear this.
[4861.78 → 4862.98] As you differentiate
[4862.98 → 4863.70] yourself,
[4863.80 → 4864.46] maybe from your
[4864.46 → 4865.64] parents' belief,
[4865.96 → 4867.60] as you differentiate
[4867.60 → 4868.80] yourself and decide
[4868.80 → 4870.70] to take responsibility
[4870.70 → 4872.48] for what you believe
[4872.48 → 4874.42] to the faith
[4874.42 → 4875.94] that was told to you,
[4876.44 → 4877.00] Lord willing,
[4877.16 → 4877.78] that becomes
[4877.78 → 4878.96] the faith that is
[4878.96 → 4880.18] held in you.
[4881.86 → 4883.10] And as you do that,
[4883.16 → 4883.96] I want you to ask
[4883.96 → 4885.12] those hard questions.
[4886.20 → 4886.96] And I want this
[4886.96 → 4887.62] to be a place
[4887.62 → 4888.64] where we can wrestle
[4888.64 → 4890.16] with those hard questions,
[4890.26 → 4891.88] where we can deconstruct
[4891.88 → 4893.20] what people had once
[4893.20 → 4894.50] considered religious norms
[4894.50 → 4895.04] and are,
[4895.16 → 4895.64] in fact,
[4895.94 → 4897.86] products of social constructs.
[4897.86 → 4898.76] Let's talk about
[4898.76 → 4899.54] that kind of stuff.
[4900.50 → 4901.56] Let's talk about
[4901.56 → 4902.46] that together,
[4902.94 → 4903.10] right,
[4903.22 → 4904.20] face to face.
[4905.36 → 4906.18] Because doing this
[4906.18 → 4907.54] as a keyboard warrior,
[4907.70 → 4908.32] doing this in your
[4908.32 → 4908.94] echo chamber,
[4909.08 → 4910.48] doing this on your own,
[4910.78 → 4912.92] is not helpful
[4912.92 → 4914.86] and perhaps even dangerous.
[4916.02 → 4916.72] Let's get together
[4916.72 → 4917.38] in a room
[4917.38 → 4918.58] so that we can come
[4918.58 → 4919.54] out the other side
[4919.54 → 4920.70] better together.
[4921.84 → 4922.32] In fact,
[4923.14 → 4925.76] we are relaunching here
[4925.76 → 4926.64] a ministry called
[4926.64 → 4927.80] Roots and Routes.
[4927.86 → 4929.38] Which is a book study group.
[4929.56 → 4930.20] It's an opportunity
[4930.20 → 4931.58] to get informed
[4931.58 → 4932.10] on something,
[4932.18 → 4932.86] to come together
[4932.86 → 4934.02] and then just hash it out,
[4934.12 → 4935.40] to wonder and to talk about it.
[4936.36 → 4937.22] You can sign up
[4937.22 → 4937.96] for that at the back.
[4938.60 → 4939.40] Perry and Bert
[4939.40 → 4940.20] will be back there.
[4940.28 → 4941.10] You can get information
[4941.10 → 4941.64] from them.
[4941.74 → 4942.48] And the first book
[4942.48 → 4942.94] that we are going
[4942.94 → 4943.48] to read together
[4943.48 → 4944.00] is called
[4944.00 → 4945.10] The Secular Creed
[4945.10 → 4946.20] and it engages
[4946.20 → 4947.72] this conversation exactly.
[4948.66 → 4949.66] So I'm going to invite you
[4949.66 → 4950.38] to that table,
[4951.38 → 4951.54] right,
[4951.62 → 4953.20] to talk to someone there
[4953.20 → 4954.40] and get signed up.
[4954.46 → 4955.88] Become part of that conversation,
[4956.04 → 4957.04] especially if you are
[4957.04 → 4957.82] a young person here
[4957.82 → 4958.54] because your voice
[4958.54 → 4959.38] is so important
[4959.38 → 4960.44] and matters for us
[4960.44 → 4961.78] to hear in that.
[4963.30 → 4963.78] But,
[4964.06 → 4966.12] even as we deconstruct
[4966.12 → 4966.88] old beliefs,
[4967.06 → 4968.20] even as we differentiate
[4968.20 → 4969.62] to our own unique expression
[4969.62 → 4970.26] of belief,
[4970.70 → 4972.14] we need to take
[4972.14 → 4973.58] that same engagement,
[4974.46 → 4974.58] right,
[4974.62 → 4976.32] that same desire
[4976.32 → 4977.82] to ask hard questions,
[4978.04 → 4979.08] that same impulse
[4979.08 → 4980.04] to deconstruct,
[4980.86 → 4981.78] we need to take that
[4981.78 → 4982.58] and apply it
[4982.58 → 4983.18] to the beliefs
[4983.18 → 4983.90] and the creeds
[4983.90 → 4984.56] of our culture.
[4985.36 → 4986.10] That's what Paul
[4986.10 → 4986.90] is saying here.
[4987.66 → 4988.96] That the fruit of growing,
[4989.10 → 4990.04] the result of growing,
[4990.18 → 4991.02] of becoming mature,
[4991.16 → 4992.26] of no longer being infants,
[4992.64 → 4993.76] means that we don't have
[4993.76 → 4994.38] to be tossed
[4994.38 → 4995.14] back and forth
[4995.14 → 4995.82] by the waves
[4995.82 → 4997.28] and blown here and there
[4997.28 → 4998.62] by every wind of teaching
[4998.62 → 4999.32] or by the cunning
[4999.32 → 5000.52] and craftiness of people
[5000.52 → 5002.10] into their direful steaming.
[5003.06 → 5005.10] We need to deconstruct
[5005.10 → 5006.14] the teachings,
[5006.46 → 5007.26] all the teachings,
[5007.26 → 5008.64] that we come across.
[5008.74 → 5009.30] We need to test
[5009.30 → 5010.06] every spirit.
[5010.32 → 5010.78] This is what we're
[5010.78 → 5011.46] encouraged to do
[5011.46 → 5012.04] in the Bible
[5012.04 → 5013.08] and we need to ask
[5013.08 → 5013.78] the hard questions
[5013.78 → 5014.80] of every idea.
[5015.24 → 5016.44] That's what we do here.
[5018.12 → 5019.16] And can I tell you,
[5019.28 → 5019.54] again,
[5019.80 → 5021.10] because I do love tradition,
[5021.54 → 5022.10] the tradition
[5022.10 → 5023.14] of the Christian faith
[5023.14 → 5024.78] is to not shy away
[5024.78 → 5026.10] from hard conversations
[5026.10 → 5027.40] and these kinds of questions.
[5028.38 → 5030.04] And that's how growth starts.
[5032.08 → 5033.36] But it's not enough
[5033.36 → 5034.28] just to cast off
[5034.28 → 5035.38] these old beliefs
[5035.38 → 5036.36] or to deconstruct
[5036.36 → 5037.06] other beliefs.
[5037.96 → 5039.22] We have to cling
[5039.22 → 5040.92] to a new belief
[5040.92 → 5042.24] or a right belief.
[5043.12 → 5044.10] In the words of my grid,
[5044.24 → 5045.10] we need to receive
[5045.10 → 5045.80] an instruction.
[5046.86 → 5048.00] That's step two, right?
[5048.06 → 5048.48] Paul says,
[5048.92 → 5049.28] instead,
[5049.60 → 5050.78] speaking the truth
[5050.78 → 5051.74] in love.
[5052.70 → 5053.62] Now that's a phrase,
[5053.78 → 5054.50] truth in love
[5054.50 → 5055.52] or truth in grace
[5055.52 → 5056.98] that sometimes gets bandied about
[5056.98 → 5057.56] and we haven't done
[5057.56 → 5058.78] a good job of defining it.
[5059.44 → 5060.60] But that means
[5060.60 → 5062.68] hearing a word of truth
[5062.68 → 5064.14] spoken in a way
[5064.14 → 5065.88] that compels my imagination
[5065.88 → 5067.54] and captivates my heart.
[5067.54 → 5069.00] It means receiving
[5069.00 → 5070.32] an instruction
[5070.32 → 5071.60] that I know
[5071.60 → 5072.78] not only intuitively
[5072.78 → 5073.72] to be true,
[5073.92 → 5075.34] but that I can see
[5075.34 → 5077.06] working out logically
[5077.06 → 5078.82] also as true.
[5079.96 → 5080.90] We need to sit
[5080.90 → 5082.06] under the preached word
[5082.06 → 5083.42] week in and week out.
[5083.64 → 5084.30] We need to allow
[5084.30 → 5085.00] the Holy Spirit
[5085.00 → 5086.14] to transform us.
[5086.24 → 5087.34] We need to sit with mentors
[5087.34 → 5088.46] and with other disciples
[5088.46 → 5089.54] and we need to study
[5089.54 → 5090.02] the scriptures.
[5090.46 → 5091.30] We need to be students
[5091.30 → 5091.98] of the word
[5091.98 → 5093.68] so that we can be disciples
[5093.68 → 5095.28] who live the word.
[5095.28 → 5098.68] Do this
[5098.68 → 5100.94] and in doing this
[5100.94 → 5103.34] we need to ask ourselves
[5103.34 → 5106.40] what are you consuming?
[5107.40 → 5108.58] What are you taking in?
[5108.62 → 5110.50] What are you being instructed in?
[5110.56 → 5111.74] Whether it's on social media,
[5112.16 → 5112.96] Instagram or TikTok
[5112.96 → 5113.96] or Facebook,
[5114.40 → 5115.26] maybe Facebook is one
[5115.26 → 5115.94] of the worst places
[5115.94 → 5116.76] right now for that.
[5117.46 → 5118.64] Whether it's in podcasts
[5118.64 → 5119.60] or TV shows,
[5119.68 → 5120.34] what are the places
[5120.34 → 5121.60] that you are taking in?
[5121.68 → 5122.84] Because these things,
[5123.18 → 5123.86] these spaces,
[5123.86 → 5124.94] are not neutral.
[5125.38 → 5126.38] They're all shaping us
[5126.38 → 5128.02] in a particular way
[5128.02 → 5129.56] into a particular vision
[5129.56 → 5130.28] of the true
[5130.28 → 5131.00] and the good
[5131.00 → 5131.88] and the beautiful.
[5133.58 → 5134.94] And I guess the question
[5134.94 → 5136.66] for you to discern
[5136.66 → 5138.88] is are you receiving
[5138.88 → 5139.54] instruction
[5139.54 → 5140.80] from the sages
[5140.80 → 5141.78] of this world
[5141.78 → 5143.12] or are you receiving
[5143.12 → 5143.68] instruction
[5143.68 → 5144.48] from the true
[5144.48 → 5145.82] and better rabbi
[5145.82 → 5146.80] whose name is Jesus?
[5147.18 → 5147.90] Are you receiving
[5147.90 → 5148.44] instruction
[5148.44 → 5150.02] from the good shepherd?
[5151.02 → 5151.76] Are you receiving
[5151.76 → 5152.36] an instruction
[5152.36 → 5153.40] that shapes you
[5153.40 → 5154.30] into the kingdom
[5154.30 → 5154.94] of heaven
[5154.94 → 5157.28] or are you receiving
[5157.28 → 5157.82] an instruction
[5157.82 → 5158.82] that shapes you
[5158.82 → 5159.84] into a kingdom
[5159.84 → 5160.66] of your own making?
[5162.10 → 5162.30] Right?
[5162.38 → 5165.06] That's full of lesser glories
[5165.06 → 5166.36] that will fade away.
[5169.16 → 5170.72] Where are you being instructed?
[5172.72 → 5173.20] Finally,
[5173.36 → 5174.60] having deconstructed
[5174.60 → 5175.36] false beliefs,
[5175.50 → 5176.14] having been
[5176.14 → 5176.68] and committed
[5176.68 → 5177.40] to instruction
[5177.40 → 5178.58] in the truth,
[5178.58 → 5180.52] we are reconstructed
[5180.52 → 5181.48] into the image
[5181.48 → 5182.78] of Jesus Christ.
[5183.52 → 5183.84] Instead,
[5184.50 → 5185.44] speaking the truth
[5185.44 → 5185.98] in love,
[5186.10 → 5186.68] we will grow
[5186.68 → 5187.28] to become
[5187.28 → 5188.32] in every respect
[5188.32 → 5189.44] the mature body
[5189.44 → 5190.00] of him
[5190.00 → 5191.12] who is the head
[5191.12 → 5192.66] that is Christ.
[5193.54 → 5194.62] This is the goal
[5194.62 → 5196.04] of all discipleship.
[5196.58 → 5197.58] This is the purpose
[5197.58 → 5199.56] of works of service
[5199.56 → 5201.90] that you are invited to,
[5202.04 → 5202.90] that we could sign up
[5202.90 → 5203.84] for afterward,
[5204.14 → 5205.98] that you would grow
[5205.98 → 5206.92] to become
[5206.92 → 5208.52] in every respect
[5208.52 → 5209.80] the mature body
[5209.80 → 5210.20] of him
[5210.20 → 5211.08] who is the head
[5211.08 → 5212.22] that is Christ.
[5213.16 → 5214.46] This is the rhythm
[5214.46 → 5216.12] of discipleship,
[5216.46 → 5216.58] right?
[5217.12 → 5217.52] Deconstruction,
[5217.76 → 5218.36] instruction,
[5219.14 → 5219.64] reconstruction.
[5220.40 → 5221.54] And then you do it again.
[5222.72 → 5223.12] Deconstruction,
[5223.56 → 5224.10] instruction,
[5224.74 → 5225.18] reconstruction.
[5225.70 → 5226.72] And then you do it again.
[5227.30 → 5227.76] Deconstruction,
[5228.22 → 5228.66] instruction,
[5229.22 → 5229.62] reconstruction.
[5229.98 → 5230.86] And then you do it again.
[5230.92 → 5231.40] I'm going to do this
[5231.40 → 5232.16] until you join me.
[5232.76 → 5233.28] Deconstruction,
[5233.66 → 5234.16] instruction,
[5234.80 → 5235.30] reconstruction.
[5235.98 → 5243.66] on and on it goes, and then you see over the course of a lifetime
[5243.66 → 5250.36] or maybe over the course of a year over the course of a lifetime or maybe over the course of 10
[5250.36 → 5262.96] there is transformation there is growth that takes place visible demonstrable real growth
[5262.96 → 5269.38] and yes there will be a falling back there will be doubts there will be real questions there will be
[5269.38 → 5276.88] seasons when you cannot believe let me say I know those seasons I have lived them and I have
[5276.88 → 5282.32] walked them and I have walked through them and more truthfully I have been carried
[5282.32 → 5287.74] through them by the community of believers around me and I've walked others through them as well
[5287.74 → 5298.28] but together here we can doubt our doubts together here we can ask hard questions together here we can
[5298.28 → 5306.78] wrestle with the faith and together here we can grow amen let's pray together
[5306.78 → 5321.86] lord Jesus right here right now allow us to ask hard questions about ourselves our hearts and our
[5321.86 → 5328.48] souls allow us to deconstruct both the lies that we have created and the ones that are being spoken
[5328.48 → 5335.18] around us allow us to be instructed in the truth of your gospel in the truth of your kingdom come and
[5335.18 → 5342.26] your kingdom coming and allow us to be reconstructed to be transformed by the renewing of our minds that we
[5342.26 → 5348.94] might go from this place growing in the grace and knowledge of our lord and saviour Jesus Christ
