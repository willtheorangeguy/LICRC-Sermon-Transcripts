• The central theme of Exodus is God's relationship with Pharaoh
• Pharaoh increases the workload for Israelites, requiring them to gather their own straw while maintaining the same quota of bricks
• Leaders plead with Moses and Aaron, but Pharaoh refuses to listen
• Moses returns to God, questioning why he brought trouble on the people and why they haven't been rescued
• God responds, affirming his covenant identity and promises to bring the Israelites out of Egypt
• Moses expresses frustration, feeling that God has not kept his promises
• God reassures Moses, citing his covenant identity and promises as a source of strength and encouragement in difficult times.
• The speaker suggests that Moses' excuses for not being a good speaker may be motivated by his own fears or anxieties rather than a genuine inability to speak.
• Good leaders don't take on the anxiety of their people, but rather recognize and manage their own anxiety.
• When anxious, one's thinking is clouded, and it becomes difficult to see the bigger picture.
• A leader should learn to be a non-anxious presence in high-pressure situations.
• Leaders cannot take away others' anxieties, only manage their own.
• It's essential for leaders to recognize and address their anxiety rather than trying to ignore or hide it.
• God is available to hear and process one's fears, worries, and anxieties.
• Leaders should not borrow worry or anxiety from the people around them.
• Anxiety and frustration can be overwhelming, but God is big enough to handle them
• Moses' anxiety caused him to forget about God's bigger plan
• The Israelites' struggle was not just about escaping Egypt, but about freedom to worship and become their own nation in their own land
• God wants our anger, frustration, and anxiety, and invites us to come to him in prayer and devotion

• The Bible's story of Israel's deliverance from Egypt is a microcosm of humanity's story
• God's promise to take his people out of Egypt and into the land is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who sets believers free from sin and death
• Jesus' life, death, and resurrection demonstrate God's power to turn evil into good
• The story is not yet fully realized, as Jesus will return to renew the world and usher in a new creation
• Believers can be guaranteed of this future through God's immutable nature
• Moses' failure to lead the Israelites due to his own discouragement and anxiety
• The responsibility of disciples to proclaim the truth about God, despite the risk of being rejected or not heard
• The danger of falling back on what is "normal" when faced with anxiety, rather than turning to God's promises and strength
