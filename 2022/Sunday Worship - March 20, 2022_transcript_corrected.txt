[2939.52 → 2969.52] Thank you.
[2969.52 → 2999.52] Thank you.
[2999.52 → 3029.50] So, from Exodus.
[3029.52 → 3059.52] 
[3059.52 → 3089.50] I will show you.
[3089.52 → 3119.52] Thank you.
[3119.52 → 3149.52] Thank you.
[3149.52 → 3179.52] Thank you.
[3179.52 → 3209.52] Thank you.
[3209.52 → 3210.88] I know, for you.
[3239.52 → 3248.60] individual things prefigure or reveal or shadow the coming work of Jesus. If I'm honest with you,
[3248.68 → 3255.64] in fact, I think a lot of times when we evangelical Christian types do that, we're stretching those
[3255.64 → 3262.30] images beyond the point of tenability. Now, even as I say that, I mean, let me be clear,
[3262.96 → 3267.38] I think there are correlations, and I think that the symbols are meaningful, and they're worth
[3267.38 → 3273.90] looking at, and I spent time in the Judean wilderness a few years ago, and we toured a
[3273.90 → 3280.26] life-size replica of the tabernacle, and we heard all sorts of those connections, and it was super cool,
[3281.06 → 3291.56] but the focus of the tabernacle for the life of the original hearer isn't about the particular
[3291.56 → 3298.82] items of furniture or about how they are applied to the life of the Israelites. Instead, the focus
[3298.82 → 3304.86] for the hearer is how these things function together, how the whole tabernacle functions,
[3304.86 → 3311.22] and then eventually the temple, right, how it functions to move Israel's relationship to God
[3311.22 → 3322.26] to a deeper and more intimate level. And I want to do the same. What matters to us this morning is that
[3322.26 → 3330.96] same function, right, the function of the tabernacle to draw people into the presence of God. Now, if your
[3330.96 → 3343.88] Bibles are open, jump to the end of the book, to chapter 40. Chapter 40 and verse 34 in Exodus ends by saying,
[3343.88 → 3351.82] then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.
[3352.94 → 3358.32] And Moses could not enter the tent of meeting because the cloud had settled on it, and the glory
[3358.32 → 3365.96] of the Lord filled the tabernacle. In all the travels of the Israelites, whenever the cloud lifted from
[3365.96 → 3372.16] above the tabernacle, they would set out. But if the cloud did not lift, they did not set out until
[3372.16 → 3377.48] the day it lifted. And so the cloud of the Lord was over the tabernacle by day, and the fire was in the
[3377.48 → 3387.04] cloud by night, and in sight of all the Israelites during all their travels. The cloud of God's presence
[3387.04 → 3399.56] settled on the tabernacle, and the glory of the Lord filled it. The tabernacle is the place of God,
[3399.56 → 3409.62] the dwelling place of God in the Israelite community. So I think it's important then for us in this space
[3409.62 → 3416.60] and time to focus on the intention and the role the tabernacle played in the life of the Israelite.
[3416.60 → 3422.30] To the Israelites. So the question for us, the appropriate question for us this morning is not
[3422.30 → 3427.42] what do I do with this section, or what do I do with all these articles and the particular details
[3427.42 → 3434.82] of it, but what does the tabernacle tell me about God and how he deals with his people?
[3435.86 → 3440.86] In other words, the question is, what is the theology of tabernacle?
[3440.86 → 3451.40] Now the tabernacle, and later the temple, along with everything that takes place in it and is placed
[3451.40 → 3460.96] in it, are at the very centre of Israel's relationship to God. And so throughout, whether it was
[3460.96 → 3469.52] understood by those who practiced it, right, these institutions, these places and items are a symbol
[3469.52 → 3477.38] of a higher, of a heavenly reality. For the people of Israel, it's through the tabernacle and then
[3477.38 → 3482.06] through the temple as the dwelling place of God that God can be found.
[3484.60 → 3492.84] Let me put it this way. The tabernacle is an earthly representation of a heavenly reality.
[3492.84 → 3500.86] And in fact, just like in the Garden of Eden, way back in Genesis 1 and 2 at the beginning, just like
[3500.86 → 3509.78] the Garden of Eden is the sort of centre of creation and the place where God dwells, in fact, in Jewish
[3509.78 → 3514.90] rabbinical tradition, the Garden of Eden and heaven are almost one and the same thing.
[3516.36 → 3521.22] Just like the Garden of Eden is the place where God dwells, and it's the centre of creation,
[3521.22 → 3530.10] so to the tabernacle is in the centre of the Israelite camp and all life is centred around
[3530.10 → 3531.60] the presence of God.
[3534.06 → 3540.50] Now, if you've been with us in this look at the book of Exodus, we have seen over and over again
[3540.50 → 3544.68] a return to this theme of creation and recreation.
[3544.68 → 3553.22] In the plagues, we saw the creation order being undone for a period of time in order to allow
[3553.22 → 3556.18] chaos, the plagues, to reign temporarily.
[3556.64 → 3563.00] In the crossing of the Red Sea, we saw this formerly enslaved people emerging through that
[3563.00 → 3567.94] sea into new life, recreated as these people.
[3567.94 → 3574.42] In the Ten Commandments, we saw how an orderly God has intended for life to be ordered in
[3574.42 → 3575.66] response to his grace.
[3576.86 → 3582.94] Throughout the tabernacle story, allusions to the creation are made.
[3584.14 → 3591.96] In fact, we don't have to look at this precisely, but six times in these first five chapters, or
[3591.96 → 3598.04] these next five chapters, six times it says, and the Lord said to Moses, and then there
[3598.04 → 3600.46] are instructions given on how to build the tabernacle.
[3601.24 → 3609.08] And then in chapter 31, verse 12, it says, a seventh time, and the Lord said to Moses,
[3609.88 → 3612.40] and then he gives instructions on the Sabbath.
[3613.84 → 3614.28] Right?
[3614.28 → 3620.58] It's as if, for God and for Israel, the tabernacle itself is an act of recreation.
[3621.16 → 3621.24] Right?
[3621.32 → 3626.92] God claiming a little bit of the fallen world for himself in order in which to dwell.
[3627.96 → 3628.16] Right?
[3628.22 → 3639.04] A residence among humanity who rejected him in Adam and Eve in the sanctuary that was Eden
[3639.04 → 3641.28] in that little piece of heaven.
[3641.28 → 3642.12] Right?
[3642.22 → 3659.56] In the tabernacle, God is making himself a new sanctuary amid the wilderness of a sinful
[3659.56 → 3660.54] world.
[3661.26 → 3667.48] The tabernacle, and then the temple, is the centre of Israel's religious life and activity
[3667.48 → 3671.00] because that is the place where God dwells.
[3671.00 → 3677.22] And without the temple and without the tabernacle, these people cease to be the active, worshipping
[3677.22 → 3678.32] people of God.
[3679.30 → 3686.08] In fact, the whole book of Exodus makes clear that by having these instructions at the climax,
[3686.16 → 3692.06] where they spend, you know, some 15 chapters on this part of the relationship, the very purpose
[3692.06 → 3700.28] for which Israel is recreated or is redeemed out of Egypt is to have God's visible presence
[3700.28 → 3704.68] among them and for them to be a worshipping people.
[3704.68 → 3715.46] And so, take that and all of that, that weight and that history, and then jump forward some
[3715.46 → 3717.40] 1500 years.
[3717.76 → 3717.90] Right?
[3717.96 → 3723.30] All of that meaning gets added to in the tabernacle and the life of the temple for the Israelite.
[3723.30 → 3729.74] And as we move forward from this time here in Exodus and in the wandering, eventually, as
[3729.74 → 3735.02] the people come into the land, they take the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, and they set
[3735.02 → 3736.38] it up in Shiloh.
[3736.78 → 3738.86] And that becomes the centre, the place.
[3738.98 → 3746.34] And then eventually, Solomon builds a temple, and he brings the Ark of the Covenant from the
[3746.34 → 3753.04] tabernacle into the temple and all the people see the glory of God descend on the temple now.
[3753.30 → 3755.98] The temple is the place where God resides.
[3756.66 → 3760.96] Fast forward a few hundred years from there, that temple is destroyed when the people are
[3760.96 → 3762.12] carried into exile.
[3762.74 → 3768.02] Seventy years after the exile, people return, and you can read about it in Ezra and Nehemiah,
[3768.10 → 3774.10] but a second temple is built, and they too have a ceremony of commissioning where they
[3774.10 → 3777.80] mark God's presence coming back in among the people.
[3777.98 → 3783.14] And then fast-forward another few hundred years in the time of Herod the Great, just
[3783.14 → 3784.90] before Jesus' time.
[3785.62 → 3790.84] Herod the Great, in order to win the favour of the Jewish people, commissions that temple,
[3791.00 → 3794.74] that second temple, to be completely refurbished and done again.
[3796.18 → 3802.46] And so take all of that history, right, all of that priority of place and of purpose and
[3802.46 → 3809.94] identity and then read that behind Jesus' words in John 2, right?
[3809.98 → 3815.12] In John 2, Jesus comes into the temple, and it's during this time of Passover and money
[3815.12 → 3818.30] changers and vendors have set up in the outer courts.
[3818.70 → 3823.30] And Jesus, if you know the story, he fashions a whip, and he turns tables over, he kicks everyone
[3823.30 → 3827.34] out and the leaders come up to him, and they say, by what authority do you do this?
[3827.34 → 3836.60] And Jesus says to them, destroy this temple and I will raise it in three days.
[3837.72 → 3844.24] To which they replied, it has taken 46 years to build this temple, and you are going to raise
[3844.24 → 3845.22] it in three days?
[3846.36 → 3850.82] Now that 46 years refers to the refurbishing of Herod the Great.
[3850.82 → 3858.40] But really, the temple itself had been on these foundations for some thousand years before,
[3859.10 → 3860.84] even if it was destroyed and rebuilt.
[3862.42 → 3870.02] Now at that moment, John quickly adds that Jesus was talking about his body, right, the
[3870.02 → 3874.42] temple of his body and his resurrection after he died.
[3874.46 → 3877.44] But the Jews to whom he was speaking didn't know that.
[3877.44 → 3882.64] But Jesus is changing something.
[3883.34 → 3891.12] Or to be more precise, Jesus' incarnation changed something about how the presence of God is
[3891.12 → 3893.02] mediated to the world.
[3894.10 → 3894.58] Right?
[3894.64 → 3902.88] From the text of John, an illustration that something has fundamentally changed, John is
[3902.88 → 3907.68] showing us that something has fundamentally changed in the coming of Jesus in the theology
[3907.68 → 3910.42] of tabernacle, right, of God's presence.
[3911.42 → 3916.52] In fact, John makes this point even more explicit in his opening chapter.
[3917.38 → 3920.38] In John 1, verse 14, you can read,
[3920.64 → 3924.46] The word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.
[3924.46 → 3932.16] You might not see it in English, but that word that's translated dwelling is from the Greek
[3932.16 → 3932.94] words keno.
[3933.38 → 3939.32] It's the verbal form of the word that the Greek translation of the Old Testament used for
[3939.32 → 3940.30] tabernacle.
[3941.62 → 3943.84] And so, to make the point more explicit, we can say,
[3943.84 → 3950.76] Jesus, the word who was with God and who was God, the one in whom we see the glory of the
[3950.76 → 3957.64] one and only, full of grace and truth, Jesus tabernacle among his people.
[3959.10 → 3959.20] Right?
[3959.26 → 3968.06] John's intention in this gospel is to show that Jesus is the new, improved temple or tabernacle.
[3968.06 → 3975.00] To use the language that I used earlier, right, in Jesus, God is revealing himself as the true
[3975.00 → 3978.28] sanctuary amid the wilderness of a sinful world.
[3979.12 → 3979.68] Right?
[3979.78 → 3986.70] For us, and to see Jesus is to see God revealing himself as the true sanctuary amid the wilderness
[3986.70 → 3987.76] of a sinful world.
[3988.72 → 3997.06] Again, let me be really clear, because this new system, this new revelation doesn't replace
[3997.06 → 4000.22] the old system because it was somehow broken.
[4001.32 → 4008.44] Rather, this new system in Jesus is the culmination of what we read here in Exodus 25.
[4009.22 → 4009.36] Right?
[4009.46 → 4013.28] Jesus is the culmination of what this old system pointed to.
[4014.52 → 4022.84] One writer said that the glory that resided above the ark in the most holy place, to which
[4022.84 → 4030.00] the high priest had access only once a year, is in Jesus walking the streets of Jerusalem.
[4030.78 → 4032.00] I love that image.
[4032.60 → 4032.74] Right?
[4032.80 → 4039.08] The glory that descends onto the tabernacle, the glory that descended onto the temple, is
[4039.08 → 4043.20] in Jesus walking the streets of Jerusalem.
[4044.10 → 4050.00] And this theme of temple and tabernacle in Jesus is woven right through the whole of the
[4050.00 → 4050.30] Bible.
[4050.80 → 4051.32] Right?
[4051.38 → 4059.28] In Revelation 21, with the now return of Jesus to this earth at the head of the armies
[4059.28 → 4065.66] of all those who have gone on before us, and the descent of the new Jerusalem, the heavenly
[4065.66 → 4072.24] city, we read that there will be no temple in this city for Revelation 21, verse 22.
[4072.64 → 4076.76] The Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.
[4076.76 → 4083.72] So the dawning of this new age, the end of history as we know it, the very presence of
[4083.72 → 4089.56] God will again be in the midst of his people without being confined to a particular space
[4089.56 → 4090.50] or location.
[4091.38 → 4097.14] And like how the Garden of Eden and heaven are the same, so too in the new creation, when
[4097.14 → 4100.22] heaven comes down, but not to one spot.
[4100.58 → 4100.72] Right?
[4100.72 → 4103.90] All earth will be like the Garden was.
[4104.40 → 4106.76] That is the place of God's presence.
[4109.52 → 4114.86] And there's yet one more way that the temple and tabernacle has changed.
[4115.34 → 4120.90] As we wait for that glorious day, some time to come and come quickly, we pray.
[4120.90 → 4128.60] As we wait for that day, there is another state of God's tabernacle that we find ourselves
[4128.60 → 4129.32] part of.
[4131.06 → 4138.40] After Jesus' resurrection, he ascended into heaven, but not before he promised his continued
[4138.40 → 4141.96] dwelling with his people by the Holy Spirit.
[4142.96 → 4143.08] Right?
[4143.14 → 4149.30] And more than abide with us by the Holy Spirit, Jesus abides in us.
[4149.30 → 4149.76] Right?
[4149.82 → 4154.94] The dwelling place of God is now the very hearts of those who believe.
[4154.94 → 4161.54] The throne of God is not the Ark of the Covenant, but it is now the heart of every man and woman
[4161.54 → 4164.78] and child who confesses Jesus as Lord.
[4165.62 → 4171.82] And so in that same way that we have been talking, in you now, in you, God is making himself
[4171.82 → 4176.08] a new sanctuary amid the wilderness of a sinful world.
[4176.08 → 4182.04] The Apostle Paul says in 1 Corinthians,
[4183.46 → 4189.16] Don't you know that you yourselves are God's temple and that God's Spirit lives in you?
[4189.64 → 4191.12] And then again in chapter 6, he says,
[4191.48 → 4196.72] Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have
[4196.72 → 4198.30] received from God?
[4198.40 → 4200.26] You are not your own.
[4200.26 → 4204.96] The church, and by this I mean individual believers, right?
[4205.18 → 4209.74] The church, collectively and individually, is the place where God dwells.
[4210.32 → 4216.32] The tabernacle of God, once external, is now internal in your hearts and souls.
[4216.78 → 4219.00] We are the tabernacle of God.
[4219.10 → 4222.70] God has taken residence in each of us who believe.
[4222.70 → 4233.92] And what's more, God now reveals himself in part through each of us in whom he dwells.
[4236.50 → 4237.92] So what does this mean?
[4239.42 → 4242.94] We're going to look at two, maybe three things.
[4244.06 → 4250.72] First, what this means, contrary to what some of us think and what some of us pray,
[4250.72 → 4254.76] the church building is not house of God.
[4256.44 → 4262.24] How many times have you prayed or heard, right, we come to the house of God to worship him?
[4262.66 → 4266.22] Or how many of us have prayed, right, we thank you that we can come to your house?
[4267.20 → 4271.98] Right, the dwelling place of God is not contained in these four walls.
[4272.72 → 4278.76] Right, the dwelling place of God is not contingent upon us creating some sort of sacred space
[4278.76 → 4283.24] with the right decorations and the right appointments and having the right ceremonies of anointing.
[4283.72 → 4290.98] The dwelling place of God is within each of us who have been touched and filled with the Holy Spirit.
[4291.26 → 4294.94] The church is not a building, it is a people, it is you.
[4297.74 → 4301.74] Now the people probably need a place to gather.
[4302.66 → 4303.88] And so maybe we have buildings.
[4303.88 → 4306.34] Notice the probably and the maybe.
[4307.22 → 4308.22] Because it's not necessary.
[4309.44 → 4312.38] You are the dwelling place of God.
[4312.58 → 4316.72] The church is the people who have God with them and that's why we gather.
[4317.22 → 4321.26] Right, that's why the rhythms of religious practice are so important.
[4321.26 → 4326.34] Because we are cultivating God's presence in our hearts and in our lives.
[4326.34 → 4333.46] We gather together as the body, as the church, precisely because God dwells in us.
[4333.68 → 4342.04] Or because there's a small part of our hearts or our mind that is longing for something that we just can't yet begin to explain.
[4342.30 → 4346.10] Longing for God to dwell in us more and more.
[4346.10 → 4356.18] Worship, like the tabernacle then, is a place where heaven and earth meet.
[4357.52 → 4362.62] Where we come together, and we have a foretaste of the kingdom of God.
[4363.46 → 4368.60] We set one day apart in seven as a matter of following created order.
[4368.76 → 4372.42] Yes, to rest in God and to find God in us.
[4372.42 → 4375.14] It's about God's presence.
[4376.10 → 4383.80] And corporate worship then, as a foretaste of the heavenly banquet to come, is a taste of eternity.
[4384.06 → 4391.42] And as Ecclesiastes says, God has placed eternity in every person's heart.
[4392.54 → 4398.06] Now the second thing is regarding then what we put into our temples.
[4398.06 → 4412.80] If our hearts, or more comprehensively, our entire selves, our heart and our souls and our minds are the dwelling place of God,
[4413.80 → 4423.20] should we not then be careful of what we expose our hearts to or what we take into our temples?
[4423.20 → 4432.44] When Paul was writing in 1 Corinthians 6, he's referring to certain illicit sexual practices of the Corinthian church.
[4432.78 → 4437.64] But in our culture, just like the Corinthian culture, we are tempted to say things like,
[4438.00 → 4438.96] it's only sex.
[4439.28 → 4440.20] It's no big deal.
[4441.44 → 4443.14] But that misses the point entirely.
[4443.14 → 4447.76] If you are a temple of God, it's not just sex.
[4450.84 → 4455.42] But it's something you are building in your temple.
[4456.00 → 4458.96] And I think actually that the analogy can go further.
[4459.84 → 4466.26] In the construction of the tabernacle, and if you spend time this week reading through these next few chapters,
[4466.26 → 4470.40] you will see that they are incredibly precise,
[4470.72 → 4476.66] and that not even the slightest deviation from the instructions would be tolerated or accepted.
[4477.12 → 4480.82] There can be no deviation from God's demands and his design.
[4481.26 → 4487.06] And yet, how many of us, when we think about our bodies now as a temple of the Lord,
[4487.16 → 4490.90] have that same high bar, that same high standard?
[4490.90 → 4493.44] And remember the order from a couple of weeks ago, right?
[4493.48 → 4495.98] We don't demand a high bar in order to get in.
[4496.26 → 4500.34] The bar is high as a response for those who are in.
[4501.58 → 4503.76] But how many of us go through life thinking,
[4504.46 → 4506.40] just a little pornography?
[4508.12 → 4509.74] Go through life thinking,
[4510.00 → 4513.18] it's just a little gratuitous violence.
[4513.62 → 4514.66] It's just a little gore.
[4514.74 → 4516.42] It's just a little bad language.
[4516.42 → 4520.32] How many of us gorge ourselves on gossip or on slander?
[4520.32 → 4525.02] How many of us have become obese with hatred and anger that we just can't get rid of?
[4525.26 → 4526.92] These are the appointments of your temple.
[4528.56 → 4530.66] Consciously or unconsciously,
[4530.76 → 4535.18] our lives are a struggle between giving God the throne of our hearts
[4535.18 → 4538.88] and putting other things, idolatrous things, in his place.
[4539.36 → 4544.08] You, you are a temple of God.
[4544.08 → 4545.20] And hear that this morning,
[4545.58 → 4547.72] not with guilt or with judgment,
[4547.94 → 4551.44] but with grace and with aspiration to who God is.
[4551.76 → 4554.32] You are a temple of God.
[4554.40 → 4558.46] Hear that with all the worth that it puts into your being
[4558.46 → 4562.56] and into your heart and mind about who you are in Christ Jesus.
[4562.92 → 4565.24] You are a temple of God.
[4565.24 → 4569.36] But when you look at your life,
[4571.00 → 4571.70] is that what you see?
[4574.94 → 4576.96] Is that how you've treated?
[4579.36 → 4581.32] And finally, lastly,
[4582.12 → 4585.32] as you ask yourselves that question,
[4586.32 → 4590.38] the question about what we have put into our temples,
[4591.18 → 4592.78] we come to the heart of it.
[4592.78 → 4594.48] Because you see,
[4594.54 → 4597.78] this is another reason why we need corporate worship
[4597.78 → 4599.16] and why corporate worship,
[4599.32 → 4603.56] why gathering together as brothers and sisters is so important.
[4604.10 → 4607.28] We gather the body of those who believe
[4607.28 → 4610.34] in order to hear this message.
[4610.98 → 4613.96] We come to hear the message of forgiveness.
[4614.82 → 4616.90] We come to hear the message of grace.
[4617.18 → 4618.00] We come to,
[4618.30 → 4620.24] by the working of God's Holy Spirit
[4620.24 → 4622.40] in unique and powerful ways,
[4622.40 → 4623.28] in our gathering,
[4623.28 → 4626.78] to receive strength and courage to go on.
[4627.98 → 4628.90] Right here,
[4629.12 → 4630.68] we are called to repentance.
[4631.48 → 4632.24] And here,
[4632.40 → 4633.92] we find assurance.
[4635.00 → 4637.06] And that's not just some little thing
[4637.06 → 4638.92] that the worship team leads every once in a while
[4638.92 → 4639.62] that we tolerate
[4639.62 → 4641.02] because we want to get to the next song.
[4641.74 → 4644.28] That matters in what we do together.
[4644.90 → 4645.10] Right?
[4645.16 → 4647.74] We are here to hear the gospel proclaimed
[4647.74 → 4650.76] to the darkest corners of our hearts and our minds.
[4650.76 → 4653.98] We are here to have the truth told
[4653.98 → 4657.14] that we are lavishly loved children of God.
[4657.22 → 4660.56] We are here to be emboldened by the gospel of Jesus.
[4660.76 → 4663.36] We are here to be empowered by the Holy Spirit.
[4663.64 → 4664.32] And here,
[4664.50 → 4665.26] you are told,
[4665.46 → 4667.08] week in and week out,
[4667.34 → 4669.42] that even though I am more sinful
[4669.42 → 4670.90] than I could ever dare admit
[4670.90 → 4672.26] or really ever even know,
[4672.26 → 4674.48] I am yet more loved
[4674.48 → 4677.18] than I could ever imagine possible.
[4677.84 → 4679.48] And that out of that love,
[4679.68 → 4681.74] Jesus came into the world.
[4681.90 → 4682.18] Jesus,
[4682.42 → 4683.94] the true and better temple.
[4684.18 → 4686.32] Jesus tabernacle among us
[4686.32 → 4688.48] to live the perfect life of righteousness
[4688.48 → 4691.10] and to fulfill the demands of the law.
[4691.36 → 4693.10] And that his death on the cross
[4693.10 → 4695.60] was the great once for all sacrifice
[4695.60 → 4698.02] that all other sacrifices have pointed to.
[4698.02 → 4701.08] And that his resurrection out of that grave
[4701.08 → 4704.12] is God's victory over sin and death.
[4704.22 → 4706.98] And it is a guarantee of my resurrection.
[4707.16 → 4710.16] It is a guarantee of your resurrection by grace.
[4710.44 → 4712.20] That his exaltation now
[4712.20 → 4713.62] to the right hand of God the Father,
[4713.72 → 4715.58] that every knee should bow and tongue confess
[4715.58 → 4717.64] that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[4717.76 → 4719.90] His exaltation is his reward.
[4720.24 → 4723.68] And my exalting him is my reward.
[4724.34 → 4726.48] His glory is my joy.
[4728.02 → 4730.84] And as he is seated at the right hand of the Father,
[4731.42 → 4735.82] he and the Father send the Spirit to us.
[4737.16 → 4739.76] Be his presence in me.
[4740.98 → 4743.86] Be my life, Christ.
[4746.16 → 4747.42] And so now,
[4748.34 → 4750.46] make sure you hear this.
[4750.46 → 4753.96] If that message,
[4754.38 → 4755.60] that truth,
[4755.94 → 4758.50] is only ever heard in here,
[4758.60 → 4760.80] in this churchy space,
[4761.46 → 4763.46] or you only ever hear that up here,
[4763.58 → 4766.14] bouncing around in your mind space,
[4766.50 → 4767.94] you're missing the point.
[4769.38 → 4769.58] Right?
[4769.64 → 4771.12] We gather here
[4771.12 → 4773.78] in order to scatter out there.
[4773.92 → 4775.26] We journey in
[4775.26 → 4777.20] in order to journey out.
[4777.46 → 4777.60] Right?
[4777.60 → 4779.52] God tabernacles in us
[4779.52 → 4781.80] so that we can bring his presence
[4781.80 → 4783.16] out to the world
[4783.16 → 4785.88] as we go from this place.
[4786.02 → 4787.98] We gather to scatter.
[4788.14 → 4789.14] It's the very identity
[4789.14 → 4790.22] of what we do here,
[4790.28 → 4791.62] the very core of what we do here.
[4791.86 → 4794.36] We gather in the presence of God
[4794.36 → 4797.80] to be filled by the presence of God,
[4797.90 → 4800.18] to go with the presence of God,
[4800.18 → 4803.64] to be the presence of God
[4803.64 → 4804.80] in the world.
[4806.72 → 4807.94] We gather
[4807.94 → 4809.66] to scatter.
[4810.64 → 4812.04] What we do here
[4812.04 → 4813.82] has a direct impact
[4813.82 → 4815.62] on what you do out there
[4815.62 → 4816.70] and vice versa
[4816.70 → 4817.58] as you bring that
[4817.58 → 4819.08] into this place.
[4820.38 → 4822.82] The worship that starts here
[4822.82 → 4823.76] continues
[4823.76 → 4825.20] out there.
[4825.68 → 4826.82] Differently,
[4827.00 → 4827.26] sure,
[4827.60 → 4828.08] absolutely,
[4828.50 → 4828.76] but
[4828.76 → 4830.80] because God goes with you,
[4830.80 → 4832.46] if you are a plumber,
[4832.76 → 4833.88] you do that as worship.
[4834.56 → 4836.10] Because God goes with you,
[4836.14 → 4837.14] if you are a teacher,
[4837.48 → 4839.02] you do that as worship.
[4839.20 → 4840.62] Because God goes with you,
[4840.92 → 4842.10] the how and why
[4842.10 → 4842.80] of your plumbing
[4842.80 → 4843.82] or of your teaching
[4843.82 → 4845.14] or of your policing
[4845.14 → 4846.28] or you're politicking
[4846.28 → 4847.16] or you're parenting,
[4847.60 → 4848.14] you're nursing
[4848.14 → 4849.10] or you're volunteering,
[4849.50 → 4851.16] because God goes with you,
[4851.26 → 4852.74] the how and why
[4852.74 → 4855.06] is part of what it means for you,
[4855.46 → 4856.82] the individual you,
[4856.94 → 4858.22] the particular you now,
[4858.22 → 4859.62] to be on mission
[4859.62 → 4861.02] with him
[4861.02 → 4862.08] in the world,
[4862.42 → 4864.68] to be God's tabernacle
[4864.68 → 4866.36] in the world,
[4866.98 → 4868.30] the place where he dwells.
[4869.52 → 4871.72] The how of God's presence
[4871.72 → 4872.42] in the world
[4872.42 → 4874.70] has fundamentally shifted
[4874.70 → 4876.14] from the tabernacle
[4876.14 → 4877.00] as a tent
[4877.00 → 4878.14] to you
[4878.14 → 4880.54] as God's tabernacle.
[4881.70 → 4882.10] You,
[4882.40 → 4883.88] how you live,
[4883.98 → 4885.20] how you love,
[4885.42 → 4885.66] you,
[4885.66 → 4886.86] how you lead
[4886.86 → 4888.32] and how you follow,
[4888.52 → 4888.72] you,
[4888.86 → 4889.94] how you serve
[4889.94 → 4891.86] and how you receive service,
[4892.28 → 4892.44] you,
[4892.60 → 4893.32] how you work
[4893.32 → 4894.34] and how you rest.
[4894.76 → 4897.48] You are the presence of God.
[4897.90 → 4899.68] You reveal him
[4899.68 → 4900.94] and his kingdom come
[4900.94 → 4903.06] and his kingdom come.
[4904.46 → 4907.78] That is a mission worth living.
[4908.14 → 4912.86] That is a purpose worth going after.
[4912.86 → 4916.28] That is your life
[4916.28 → 4919.06] of worship.
[4920.36 → 4923.36] You are the presence of God
[4923.36 → 4925.88] for those around us
[4925.88 → 4928.40] because God's presence
[4928.40 → 4929.94] lives in.
[4931.40 → 4932.08] Amen?
[4932.94 → 4933.62] Amen.
[4933.88 → 4934.26] Let's pray.
[4934.26 → 4940.44] Holy,
[4940.44 → 4942.64] heavenly God,
[4943.64 → 4946.90] may we
[4946.90 → 4949.04] know
[4949.04 → 4950.60] your presence
[4950.60 → 4952.76] among us.
[4953.62 → 4954.68] May we know
[4954.68 → 4955.54] your presence
[4955.54 → 4956.48] in
[4956.48 → 4957.48] us.
[4959.02 → 4959.62] And now,
[4959.76 → 4960.72] as we go
[4960.72 → 4961.76] on mission
[4961.76 → 4962.92] with you,
[4963.66 → 4964.62] as we go,
[4964.78 → 4965.44] may we go
[4965.44 → 4966.50] to reveal
[4966.50 → 4967.22] you
[4967.22 → 4968.20] to the world
[4968.20 → 4969.32] in all that we do.
[4970.14 → 4970.88] May we go
[4970.88 → 4972.10] with a boldness
[4972.10 → 4972.92] that comes
[4972.92 → 4974.12] from your spirit
[4974.12 → 4975.68] within our hearts,
[4977.10 → 4977.92] pouring out
[4977.92 → 4979.56] your love.
[4981.08 → 4981.84] Send us out
[4981.84 → 4982.14] now
[4982.14 → 4982.98] with this
[4982.98 → 4983.82] purpose,
[4983.94 → 4984.68] this purpose
[4984.68 → 4985.68] of worship
[4985.68 → 4986.78] and mission.
[4987.98 → 4988.96] Send us out
[4988.96 → 4989.54] because
