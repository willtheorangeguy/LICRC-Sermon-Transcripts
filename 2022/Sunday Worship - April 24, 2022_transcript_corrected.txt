[1442.74 → 1445.74] But because of His own purpose and grace.
[1445.74 → 1450.74] The grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time.

[2935.96 → 2937.64] Bye, Hank
[2937.64 → 2938.38] Bye, everyone
[2938.38 → 2940.54] Alright, and everybody stand up
[2940.54 → 2941.02] Hey
[2941.02 → 2942.72] Oh, yeah, that's nice
[2942.72 → 2947.14] Alright, we're going to do the kids' blessing before we go, okay?
[2947.22 → 2948.16] So hands up, hands up
[2948.16 → 2949.06] Are you ready?
[2949.62 → 2951.64] We're going to say the Lord be with you together, alright?
[2951.78 → 2952.22] Are you ready?
[2952.42 → 2953.76] One, two, three
[2953.76 → 2956.22] The Lord be with you
[2956.22 → 2958.16] And also with you
[2958.16 → 2959.62] Alright, Gems, you can sit back down
[2959.62 → 2961.30] Kids, you can head to Children's Worship Time
[2961.30 → 2991.28] Thank you
[2991.30 → 3003.04] Good morning
[3003.04 → 3005.84] My name is John
[3005.84 → 3007.66] And I am an elder here in the church
[3007.66 → 3010.50] And I would like to lead you through our congregational prayer this morning
[3010.50 → 3015.44] A couple of things that I want to mention beforehand
[3015.44 → 3019.36] And one is just off the cuff here this morning
[3019.36 → 3027.18] Forgive me here, but we often talk about bringing in fragrant offering to the Lord
[3027.18 → 3030.42] And as I walk up
[3030.42 → 3033.92] And I see these lilacs up front here
[3033.92 → 3036.04] Displayed so wonderfully
[3036.04 → 3037.92] That is a fragrant offering
[3037.92 → 3042.96] And we need to be thankful each week for the offerings we give
[3042.96 → 3044.78] But this morning's is definitely fragrant
[3044.78 → 3049.72] A couple other things I would like to mention
[3049.72 → 3051.30] One is Janet Boat
[3051.30 → 3054.04] A member, a long-time member of our church
[3054.04 → 3056.24] Will be leaving us
[3056.24 → 3058.76] And on May the 11th
[3058.76 → 3061.90] She will be moving to Lacombe, Alberta
[3061.90 → 3064.82] She has some children living in the valley here
[3064.82 → 3068.20] But she also has children and grandchildren in Alberta
[3068.20 → 3070.38] And she feels at this time in her life
[3070.38 → 3072.80] It was time to move back to Alberta
[3072.80 → 3076.66] And so she will be leaving us on the 11th of May
[3076.66 → 3081.12] She has not been with us here physically in church for the last couple of years
[3081.12 → 3082.90] During this season of COVID
[3082.90 → 3085.38] And for other reasons perhaps as well
[3085.38 → 3089.08] But you are certainly welcome and encouraged to contact her
[3089.08 → 3095.84] And to wish her God's blessings as she moves to Alberta at this time in her life
[3095.84 → 3099.38] I would also like to
[3099.38 → 3103.96] We will keep in prayer also the Baumann family
[3103.96 → 3105.04] Robin and her family
[3105.04 → 3108.82] As they continue to grieve the passing away
[3108.82 → 3109.82] The death of her father
[3109.82 → 3113.10] Some of you may also know the Flores family
[3113.10 → 3117.02] Wally Flores passed away this past weekend
[3117.02 → 3122.84] He was a member of the greater Reformed community here in the valley as well
[3122.84 → 3124.94] And some of you may know him as well
[3124.94 → 3128.02] And we will keep his family in our prayers also
[3128.02 → 3129.82] Shall we pray?
[3133.40 → 3134.30] Heavenly Father
[3134.30 → 3139.64] We bow our heads before you on this Sunday morning
[3139.64 → 3144.60] Lord you are great
[3144.60 → 3147.00] You are awesome
[3147.00 → 3151.28] You are powerful and all-knowing
[3151.28 → 3154.40] And Lord you have created this world
[3154.40 → 3155.76] And we thank you for that
[3155.76 → 3158.80] We thank you for allowing us to be part of this creation
[3158.80 → 3162.94] And Lord we
[3162.94 → 3167.14] Perhaps look back on this past week
[3167.14 → 3169.90] And we Lord some of us perhaps have been busy
[3169.90 → 3173.04] Busy in our daily lives
[3173.04 → 3175.62] And Lord we thank you for your perfect creation
[3175.62 → 3177.72] And that we may have this day of rest
[3177.72 → 3179.92] And Lord we pray that through this also
[3179.92 → 3180.98] We may honour you
[3180.98 → 3182.14] And be thankful for
[3182.14 → 3184.70] All that you have done for us
[3184.70 → 3186.52] All that you have given to us
[3186.52 → 3192.06] Lord above all we thank you for the gift of your son Jesus
[3192.06 → 3195.18] Lord as we have also celebrated and remembered
[3195.18 → 3196.64] In the last number of weeks
[3196.64 → 3199.04] Through Lent his death and resurrection
[3199.04 → 3202.66] And Lord through this perfect gift of yours
[3202.66 → 3204.50] We may have eternal life
[3204.50 → 3206.68] And again Lord we say thank you
[3206.68 → 3210.92] Still Lord we know we have fallen short
[3210.92 → 3215.10] And we pray that your spirit would work in our hearts
[3215.10 → 3217.26] Each day, each moment of our lives
[3217.26 → 3220.30] So that we may be focused on you at all times
[3220.30 → 3222.88] And Lord we pray that through our living
[3222.88 → 3226.36] Others too may see that you live in us
[3226.36 → 3230.72] Lord we ask and pray that there would be many
[3230.72 → 3233.42] Each day again who turn their hearts to you
[3233.42 → 3237.42] And Lord we pray
[3237.42 → 3241.62] This also in
[3241.62 → 3244.90] Ukraine and Russia
[3244.90 → 3248.76] Lord where things are happening
[3248.76 → 3250.74] That are indescribable
[3250.74 → 3252.58] Hard to understand
[3252.58 → 3255.36] Lord this warfare that is going on
[3255.36 → 3258.44] Lord we pray for your children
[3258.44 → 3260.22] In those countries that they may
[3260.22 → 3263.42] Lord in special ways
[3263.42 → 3265.30] Feel your experience
[3265.30 → 3266.90] Your comfort and your strength
[3266.90 → 3268.94] That they too Lord
[3268.94 → 3270.98] May continue to stay focused on you
[3270.98 → 3274.58] We pray Lord for safety
[3274.58 → 3276.40] We pray for the many families
[3276.40 → 3278.58] That grieve the death of loved ones there
[3278.58 → 3283.44] And Lord we pray for
[3283.44 → 3286.52] A miracle of
[3286.52 → 3289.20] Peace there also
[3289.20 → 3290.46] And we ask Lord that you
[3290.46 → 3292.42] Through your spirit would also work
[3292.42 → 3293.56] In the hearts of the leaders
[3293.56 → 3295.34] Of those Lord who are
[3295.34 → 3296.96] Promoting this warfare
[3296.96 → 3298.82] That Lord that too may cease
[3298.82 → 3302.54] And Lord as impossible as that seems
[3302.54 → 3304.04] To us, we know that with you
[3304.04 → 3305.46] All things are possible
[3305.46 → 3307.88] Lord we
[3307.88 → 3312.44] Thank you for this Sunday
[3312.44 → 3313.88] We thank you for Gems
[3313.88 → 3316.38] Lord we thank you for these girls
[3316.38 → 3318.04] And for the leaders
[3318.04 → 3320.70] For their ministry Lord that they have
[3320.70 → 3321.94] In this church also
[3321.94 → 3323.22] In this community
[3323.22 → 3325.70] We pray for blessing on them
[3325.70 → 3329.70] And Lord as they celebrate
[3329.70 → 3332.16] Their program today also
[3332.16 → 3334.68] May we also celebrate that with them
[3334.68 → 3338.14] Lord we
[3338.14 → 3342.06] Pray for other ministries
[3342.06 → 3343.50] That continue in this church
[3343.50 → 3344.42] Weekly or
[3344.42 → 3346.74] Bi-weekly Lord we
[3346.74 → 3347.56] We pray that
[3347.56 → 3350.42] Each one may continue well
[3350.42 → 3351.14] We pray that
[3351.14 → 3353.74] For the leaders of each of these ministries
[3353.74 → 3355.34] Also Lord that you would equip them
[3355.34 → 3357.92] With the tools that they stand in need of
[3357.92 → 3361.74] Lord we
[3361.74 → 3364.26] Pray for the members of our church
[3364.26 → 3365.08] Lord who struggle
[3365.08 → 3367.46] Emotionally
[3367.46 → 3368.10] Physically
[3368.10 → 3369.40] Spiritually Lord
[3369.40 → 3370.88] We pray for marriages
[3370.88 → 3372.04] That struggle
[3372.04 → 3375.56] Lord you know each one
[3375.56 → 3377.80] And we pray for the miracle
[3377.80 → 3379.04] Of healing there also
[3379.04 → 3383.06] Lord we pray for Janet Boot
[3383.06 → 3385.14] As she leaves us
[3385.14 → 3385.18] As she leaves us
[3385.18 → 3385.94] In this coming
[3385.94 → 3387.62] Number of weeks
[3387.62 → 3390.30] We thank you, Lord, for
[3390.30 → 3392.18] Her and Peter's ministry
[3392.18 → 3393.34] Here in our congregation
[3393.34 → 3395.92] And Lord as she leaves now
[3395.92 → 3396.38] For
[3396.38 → 3397.70] Alberta
[3397.70 → 3398.76] We pray for
[3398.76 → 3400.74] Safe passage
[3400.74 → 3401.68] We pray Lord that
[3401.68 → 3404.80] You would give
[3404.80 → 3405.98] Janet peace
[3405.98 → 3407.36] As she makes this move
[3407.36 → 3410.76] And Lord we continue
[3410.76 → 3411.78] For a blessing
[3411.78 → 3412.76] On her life too
[3412.76 → 3413.52] Lord as she
[3413.52 → 3415.34] Is now alone
[3415.34 → 3416.24] And we pray that
[3416.24 → 3417.50] You would keep loneliness
[3417.50 → 3418.56] Far from her
[3418.56 → 3419.72] Lord we pray also
[3419.72 → 3420.80] For the Barman family
[3420.80 → 3421.48] We pray for the
[3421.48 → 3422.32] Flores family
[3422.32 → 3424.60] Lord as they too
[3424.60 → 3425.24] Grieve
[3425.24 → 3426.32] The loss
[3426.32 → 3427.12] Of life
[3427.12 → 3428.16] In their families
[3428.16 → 3431.76] We pray for other
[3431.76 → 3432.64] Families Lord here
[3432.64 → 3433.52] Also perhaps
[3433.52 → 3434.64] That we don't mention
[3434.64 → 3435.14] By name
[3435.14 → 3436.64] But also Lord
[3436.64 → 3437.28] Grieve
[3437.28 → 3439.10] Daily perhaps
[3439.10 → 3439.90] Or regularly
[3439.90 → 3440.26] That
[3440.26 → 3442.38] Lord life has been
[3442.38 → 3443.18] Taken from these
[3443.18 → 3443.80] Families also
[3443.80 → 3444.68] We pray for each
[3444.68 → 3445.34] One Lord that
[3445.34 → 3447.86] Comfort and strength
[3447.86 → 3448.44] May be given
[3448.44 → 3449.20] To each one
[3449.20 → 3452.96] Lord we
[3452.96 → 3454.78] Pray for our church
[3454.78 → 3455.26] As we
[3455.26 → 3456.62] Continue to seek
[3456.62 → 3457.80] Nominations for
[3457.80 → 3459.82] Office bearers
[3459.82 → 3460.84] For elders and deacons
[3460.84 → 3461.52] We pray that
[3461.52 → 3462.52] That process
[3462.52 → 3463.42] Would go smoothly
[3463.42 → 3464.86] And Lord we
[3464.86 → 3465.38] Thank you
[3465.38 → 3467.26] For the leadership
[3467.26 → 3468.00] That has been
[3468.00 → 3469.06] Given to this church
[3469.06 → 3469.60] We pray
[3469.60 → 3471.30] Continually Lord
[3471.30 → 3472.14] That you would
[3472.14 → 3473.10] Lead and guide
[3473.10 → 3473.94] And direct them
[3473.94 → 3474.62] In the decisions
[3474.62 → 3475.42] That they need
[3475.42 → 3475.90] To make
[3475.90 → 3476.98] And Lord may
[3476.98 → 3477.80] This church
[3477.80 → 3479.06] Continue to be
[3479.06 → 3479.70] A light in this
[3479.70 → 3480.12] Community
[3480.12 → 3482.94] Lord we
[3482.94 → 3484.54] Pray for
[3484.54 → 3485.24] Pastor Chris
[3485.24 → 3485.84] As he
[3485.84 → 3487.96] And his family
[3487.96 → 3488.46] Lord are
[3488.46 → 3489.72] Taking a week
[3489.72 → 3490.86] Now in Ontario
[3490.86 → 3491.62] We pray
[3491.62 → 3492.68] That Lord
[3492.68 → 3493.12] They would be
[3493.12 → 3493.66] Given rest
[3493.66 → 3494.22] There and that
[3494.22 → 3494.52] They would
[3494.52 → 3495.86] Be given safety
[3495.86 → 3496.48] And travel
[3496.48 → 3497.38] Back home again
[3497.38 → 3498.56] Lord we

[3500.16 → 3501.10] As he leads us
[3501.10 → 3501.78] Through your word
[3501.78 → 3502.40] This morning
[3502.40 → 3503.38] We pray Lord
[3503.38 → 3504.46] That our ears
[3504.46 → 3505.10] And hearts
[3505.10 → 3505.78] May be open
[3505.78 → 3506.54] To the words
[3506.54 → 3507.06] That will be
[3507.06 → 3507.46] Spoken
[3507.46 → 3508.74] To your word
[3508.74 → 3509.64] Lord as we
[3509.64 → 3510.58] Read it
[3510.58 → 3512.10] May it draw us
[3512.10 → 3512.94] Closer to you
[3512.94 → 3514.06] And Lord we pray
[3514.06 → 3514.66] For Kevin
[3514.66 → 3515.42] So that he
[3515.42 → 3516.12] Too may be
[3516.12 → 3517.32] Given the words
[3517.32 → 3517.98] That you want
[3517.98 → 3518.80] Him to speak
[3518.80 → 3520.26] In a clear
[3520.26 → 3520.88] Way
[3520.88 → 3521.64] Lord we pray
[3521.64 → 3523.28] That for a
[3523.28 → 3524.02] Blessing on this
[3524.02 → 3524.90] Service we ask
[3524.90 → 3525.64] This Lord in your
[3525.64 → 3526.06] Name
[3526.06 → 3526.92] Amen
[3526.92 → 3539.52] All right
[3539.52 → 3540.30] I'm coming down
[3540.30 → 3540.96] Here today
[3540.96 → 3541.78] Is that okay
[3541.78 → 3543.82] I realized
[3543.82 → 3544.40] At the beginning
[3544.40 → 3544.92] Of the service
[3544.92 → 3545.66] I didn't
[3545.66 → 3546.64] Introduce myself
[3546.64 → 3547.26] And, so I'm
[3547.26 → 3547.54] Going to do
[3547.54 → 3547.92] That as I
[3547.92 → 3548.58] Walk over here
[3548.58 → 3549.06] My name is
[3549.06 → 3549.30] Kevin
[3549.30 → 3549.64] Robert
[3549.64 → 3549.96] There's some
[3549.96 → 3550.56] Visitors here
[3550.56 → 3551.00] I'm the
[3551.00 → 3552.04] Youth pastor
[3552.04 → 3552.82] At this church
[3552.82 → 3553.80] And I get
[3553.80 → 3554.34] To lead us
[3554.34 → 3554.72] Through this
[3554.72 → 3555.34] Nice gem
[3555.34 → 3556.38] Sunday service
[3556.38 → 3557.16] And I'm
[3557.16 → 3557.50] Going to do
[3557.50 → 3558.38] So by dragging
[3558.38 → 3559.32] This giant
[3559.32 → 3561.14] Colourful board
[3561.14 → 3562.76] In the back
[3562.76 → 3563.34] Isn't this so
[3563.34 → 3563.72] Fancy
[3563.72 → 3564.14] It's going to
[3564.14 → 3564.52] Be such a
[3564.52 → 3565.06] Big reveal
[3565.06 → 3565.64] In a second
[3565.64 → 3567.50] All right
[3567.50 → 3568.02] You can wait
[3568.02 → 3568.50] In suspense
[3568.50 → 3569.50] Here for that
[3569.50 → 3570.96] Right
[3570.96 → 3571.60] Isn't that cool
[3571.60 → 3573.68] Oh it's from
[3573.68 → 3573.94] Gems

[3659.98 → 3660.58] That right now
[3660.58 → 3661.34] And while you're
[3661.34 → 3662.16] Thinking about it
[3662.16 → 3664.06] I also asked
[3664.06 → 3664.94] The whole church
[3664.94 → 3666.70] I asked them
[3666.70 → 3667.62] What's some stuff
[3667.62 → 3668.66] That they worry about
[3668.66 → 3669.68] And they sent it in
[3669.68 → 3670.26] On a survey
[3670.26 → 3671.26] Through Survey Monkey
[3671.26 → 3672.28] And I got like
[3672.28 → 3673.58] 40 responses
[3673.58 → 3674.22] From the church
[3674.22 → 3674.72] Which is really
[3674.72 → 3675.20] Really great
[3675.20 → 3676.68] And then I realized
[3676.68 → 3677.58] That Survey Monkey
[3677.58 → 3678.24] Has a new thing
[3678.24 → 3678.70] That I didn't read
[3678.70 → 3679.16] In the fine print
[3679.16 → 3679.72] That I was only allowed
[3679.72 → 3680.38] To see 10 of them
[3680.38 → 3681.52] And so there's 10 up here
[3681.52 → 3682.64] Because I didn't feel
[3682.64 → 3683.96] Like paying $27 a month
[3683.96 → 3684.54] So
[3684.54 → 3686.96] Thank you Survey Monkey
[3686.96 → 3687.96] Here you go

[3696.58 → 3697.44] They're real things
[3697.44 → 3698.04] Alright

[3699.26 → 3699.88] In this world
[3699.88 → 3701.04] Salvation of people
[3701.04 → 3701.86] We love is something
[3701.86 → 3702.56] People worry about
[3702.56 → 3703.10] Their health
[3703.10 → 3704.16] Getting older
[3704.16 → 3705.88] Other people's health
[3705.88 → 3706.68] They worry about that
[3706.68 → 3707.92] Things like finances
[3707.92 → 3709.22] And financial strain
[3709.22 → 3710.48] People worry about
[3710.48 → 3711.40] Not being good enough
[3711.40 → 3712.62] For like their friends
[3712.62 → 3713.56] Or their family maybe
[3713.56 → 3714.50] They worry about their kids

[3718.14 → 3719.18] All sorts of things

[3873.36 → 3874.26] You can open them up
[3874.26 → 3875.16] It's going to be on the screen
[3875.16 → 3876.58] Behind us as well
[3876.58 → 3879.42] Oh just
[3879.42 → 3880.48] Either let them go
[3880.48 → 3881.26] Or stomp on them
[3881.26 → 3882.08] Your choice
[3882.08 → 3883.84] Oh he's gone now
[3883.84 → 3884.24] He did
[3884.24 → 3885.76] Okay
[3885.76 → 3887.44] Psalm 62
[3887.44 → 3887.92] 1 to 8
[3887.92 → 3888.32] Are you ready?
[3888.66 → 3889.20] We're going to read this
[3889.20 → 3890.04] You can read it on the screen
[3890.04 → 3890.54] There behind too
[3890.54 → 3890.70] Okay?
[3890.74 → 3891.28] It says this
[3891.28 → 3892.00] Okay?
[3892.06 → 3892.42] It says
[3892.42 → 3894.00] Truly my soul
[3894.00 → 3895.38] Finds rest in God
[3895.38 → 3896.40] My salvation
[3896.40 → 3897.34] Comes from him
[3897.34 → 3898.66] And then verse 2
[3898.66 → 3899.18] Is your text
[3899.18 → 3899.70] It says this
[3899.70 → 3900.66] Truly he
[3900.66 → 3901.74] Is my rock
[3901.74 → 3902.84] And my salvation
[3902.84 → 3905.00] He is my fortress
[3905.00 → 3905.94] And I will never
[3905.94 → 3906.84] Be shaken
[3906.84 → 3907.60] Alright?
[3907.60 → 3908.14] I'll keep reading
[3908.14 → 3908.42] Okay?
[3908.42 → 3909.72] How long will you
[3909.72 → 3910.34] Assault me?
[3910.74 → 3911.64] Would all of you
[3911.64 → 3912.40] Throw me down?
[3912.54 → 3913.36] This leaning wall
[3913.36 → 3914.42] This tottering fence
[3914.42 → 3915.58] Surely they intend
[3915.58 → 3916.26] To topple me
[3916.26 → 3917.36] From my lofty place
[3917.36 → 3918.44] They take delight
[3918.44 → 3919.16] In lies
[3919.16 → 3920.02] With their mouths
[3920.02 → 3920.54] They bless
[3920.54 → 3921.32] But in their hearts
[3921.32 → 3921.90] They curse
[3921.90 → 3923.50] Yet my soul
[3923.50 → 3924.66] Find rest in God
[3924.66 → 3926.24] My hope comes from here
[3926.24 → 3926.78] And you can read this
[3926.78 → 3927.34] With me again
[3927.34 → 3927.88] Verse 6
[3927.88 → 3931.00] Truly he is my rock
[3931.00 → 3932.18] And my salvation
[3932.18 → 3934.20] He is my fortress
[3934.20 → 3936.44] I will not be shaken
[3936.44 → 3937.92] And then there's two more verses
[3937.92 → 3939.34] My salvation and my honour
[3939.34 → 3940.16] Depend on God
[3940.16 → 3941.38] He is my mighty rock
[3941.38 → 3942.22] My refuge
[3942.22 → 3943.32] Trust in him
[3943.32 → 3944.84] At all times people
[3944.84 → 3946.80] Pour out your hearts to him
[3946.80 → 3948.74] For God is our refuge
[3948.74 → 3949.76] The word of the Lord
[3949.76 → 3953.66] So I read this story this week
[3953.66 → 3956.02] Of two girls in Turkey
[3956.02 → 3957.54] There's these two little girls
[3957.54 → 3958.06] From Turkey
[3958.06 → 3959.70] They're 8 and 13 years old
[3959.70 → 3960.24] Their names are
[3960.24 → 3962.12] Evelyn and Ehrlich
[3962.12 → 3963.42] And these two girls
[3963.42 → 3964.32] A couple of years ago
[3964.32 → 3964.98] There was a really
[3964.98 → 3965.80] Really, really big
[3965.80 → 3966.86] Earthquake in Turkey
[3966.86 → 3967.72] Maybe you remember that
[3967.72 → 3968.76] It was two years ago
[3968.76 → 3969.62] It caused a lot of damage
[3969.62 → 3970.36] It actually killed
[3970.36 → 3971.08] Like a hundred people
[3971.08 → 3971.86] So it was terrifying
[3971.86 → 3972.72] It was a huge deal
[3972.72 → 3974.06] Anyway these two girls
[3974.06 → 3974.58] Were home
[3974.58 → 3975.78] When this earthquake happened
[3975.78 → 3976.80] And they were at home
[3976.80 → 3977.38] By themselves
[3977.38 → 3978.20] Because their mom and dad
[3978.20 → 3978.90] Were at work
[3978.90 → 3980.34] And all of a sudden
[3980.34 → 3981.74] The earthquake hit
[3981.74 → 3982.60] And their house started
[3982.60 → 3983.40] To like rumble
[3983.40 → 3983.98] And shake
[3983.98 → 3985.02] And without thinking
[3985.02 → 3986.60] The oldest girl
[3986.60 → 3987.18] Evelyn
[3987.18 → 3987.98] 13-year-old
[3987.98 → 3989.02] She grabbed her younger
[3989.02 → 3989.74] Sister's hand
[3989.74 → 3991.40] And they ran to the kitchen
[3991.40 → 3992.48] Into this door frame
[3992.48 → 3994.04] And they grabbed the table
[3994.04 → 3995.18] And they quickly pulled it
[3995.18 → 3996.30] Against each other
[3996.30 → 3998.10] And they held on to the table
[3998.10 → 3999.60] Right in the door frame
[3999.60 → 4000.76] And as their house
[4000.76 → 4001.86] Shook and rocked
[4001.86 → 4002.60] And as started
[4002.60 → 4003.54] Pieces of it started
[4003.54 → 4004.30] Falling down
[4004.30 → 4005.46] And crumbling around them
[4005.46 → 4006.70] They remained safe
[4006.70 → 4008.02] And then all of a sudden
[4008.02 → 4008.84] The earth stopped shaking
[4008.84 → 4010.78] And they counted to 60
[4010.78 → 4012.66] And they ran out of the house
[4012.66 → 4015.08] And then their parents
[4015.08 → 4015.46] Came home
[4015.46 → 4016.46] And they were so happy
[4016.46 → 4017.76] To see these two young girls
[4017.76 → 4019.04] Who found this foundation
[4019.04 → 4020.30] That helped them get through
[4020.30 → 4021.48] This really, really scary
[4021.48 → 4022.72] Situation
[4022.72 → 4025.20] The girls knew
[4025.20 → 4025.88] These two girls knew
[4025.88 → 4026.38] What it was like
[4026.38 → 4026.94] To be shaken
[4026.94 → 4027.52] Not just because
[4027.52 → 4028.36] Their whole house shook
[4028.36 → 4029.18] But because their house
[4029.18 → 4030.46] Disappeared in the earthquake
[4030.46 → 4031.68] They were left with nothing
[4031.68 → 4032.72] They were shaken
[4032.72 → 4033.60] They were scared
[4033.60 → 4035.92] Now there's a happy ending
[4035.92 → 4036.50] To this story
[4036.50 → 4037.60] Their house has now been rebuilt
[4037.60 → 4038.72] And they're doing great
[4038.72 → 4039.90] And everything is good
[4039.90 → 4041.50] But that's a pretty scary story
[4041.50 → 4041.82] Right?
[4041.88 → 4043.04] About being shaken
[4043.04 → 4044.58] Now the person who wrote
[4044.58 → 4045.64] The psalm that we just read
[4045.64 → 4046.34] He also knew
[4046.34 → 4047.60] What it was like to be shaken
[4047.60 → 4048.38] He was talking about
[4048.38 → 4049.46] He was worried
[4049.46 → 4050.08] He was talking about
[4050.08 → 4051.36] These evil men around them
[4051.36 → 4052.68] And he was worried about them
[4052.68 → 4054.02] And he was worried about them
[4054.02 → 4055.96] He was maybe even scared of them
[4055.96 → 4057.76] So the person in the psalm
[4057.76 → 4058.82] Maybe wasn't in an earthquake
[4058.82 → 4060.40] But he was shaken
[4060.40 → 4061.58] And he was shaking
[4061.58 → 4064.12] We can be shaken too, right?
[4064.14 → 4064.92] We just talked about that
[4064.92 → 4065.28] A little bit
[4065.28 → 4066.22] There are things that shake us
[4066.22 → 4067.34] When we feel sad
[4067.34 → 4068.10] Like when a good friend
[4068.10 → 4069.00] Moves away maybe
[4069.00 → 4070.54] Or when we feel alone
[4070.54 → 4071.98] Like when we feel like
[4071.98 → 4073.32] There's no one maybe there for us
[4073.32 → 4074.68] We feel shaken
[4074.68 → 4075.76] When we feel scared
[4075.76 → 4076.96] When we feel like
[4076.96 → 4077.58] We have a test
[4077.58 → 4078.28] Or a recital
[4078.28 → 4079.28] Or something like that
[4079.28 → 4079.94] That's bringing a little bit
[4079.94 → 4080.96] Of anxiety in our lives
[4080.96 → 4082.22] We feel shaken
[4082.22 → 4082.98] When we're ashamed
[4082.98 → 4084.10] Maybe we feel like
[4084.10 → 4084.72] We've messed up
[4084.72 → 4085.24] Or that we're going to
[4085.24 → 4086.12] Be made fun of
[4086.12 → 4086.88] By our friends
[4086.88 → 4088.56] Now it's normal
[4088.56 → 4089.56] To feel these feelings
[4089.56 → 4090.82] In fact I'm not here
[4090.82 → 4091.30] To tell you
[4091.30 → 4092.02] That you're never going
[4092.02 → 4092.68] To feel scared
[4092.68 → 4093.18] Or alone
[4093.18 → 4094.80] Or worried
[4094.80 → 4095.72] The truth is
[4095.72 → 4097.06] You might be sad sometimes
[4097.06 → 4097.98] You might feel alone
[4097.98 → 4098.86] You might be scared
[4098.86 → 4100.02] But what we're going to
[4100.02 → 4101.10] Talk about today
[4101.10 → 4102.54] Is that if you find
[4102.54 → 4104.10] Yourself feeling like this
[4104.10 → 4104.96] If you find yourself
[4104.96 → 4105.64] Feeling like this
[4105.64 → 4106.18] There is someone
[4106.18 → 4107.14] You can look to
[4107.14 → 4108.78] To get help from that
[4108.78 → 4109.32] There's someone
[4109.32 → 4110.06] You can turn to
[4110.06 → 4111.52] To stop shaking
[4111.52 → 4112.82] Alright we can turn
[4112.82 → 4113.22] Who do you think
[4113.22 → 4113.88] We can turn to
[4113.88 → 4115.40] God
[4115.40 → 4116.40] Jesus
[4116.40 → 4116.92] That's right
[4116.92 → 4117.22] And that's what
[4117.22 → 4117.92] We're going to look at today
[4117.92 → 4119.94] He is who can help us
[4119.94 → 4120.52] When we're feeling
[4120.52 → 4121.80] Scared or worried
[4121.80 → 4122.36] Or angry
[4122.36 → 4123.38] Because he
[4123.38 → 4124.28] Can give us
[4124.28 → 4125.38] This stable foundation
[4125.38 → 4126.30] Like the table
[4126.30 → 4126.96] And the door frame
[4126.96 → 4127.66] For those two girls
[4127.66 → 4128.08] In Turkey
[4128.08 → 4129.04] He can give you
[4129.04 → 4130.04] A stable foundation
[4130.04 → 4131.32] In the midst of the shaking
[4131.32 → 4132.76] And help you feel solid
[4132.76 → 4134.22] Did you know this
[4134.22 → 4134.96] As Christians
[4134.96 → 4135.96] We believe in God
[4135.96 → 4136.58] And we believe that
[4136.58 → 4137.98] Jesus has overcome everything
[4137.98 → 4139.82] And we believe that
[4139.82 → 4141.26] Jesus can do that
[4141.26 → 4141.82] Do you know why?
[4142.46 → 4143.60] Because Jesus has felt
[4143.60 → 4144.58] These things before
[4144.58 → 4145.78] Jesus knew what it was like
[4145.78 → 4146.42] To be sad
[4146.42 → 4147.96] His friend Lazarus died
[4147.96 → 4148.58] And he cried
[4148.58 → 4149.22] It says in the Bible
[4149.22 → 4150.14] He wept for him
[4150.14 → 4151.42] Jesus knows what it's like
[4151.42 → 4152.04] To be angry
[4152.04 → 4152.78] Do you know he got angry
[4152.78 → 4153.28] At the disciples
[4153.28 → 4153.96] A couple of times?
[4154.26 → 4154.94] One time because
[4154.94 → 4155.98] The disciples wouldn't let
[4155.98 → 4156.86] Kids come to Jesus
[4156.86 → 4157.92] He got very angry
[4157.92 → 4158.50] At the disciples
[4158.50 → 4160.20] Jesus knows what it's like
[4160.20 → 4161.32] To be worried and afraid
[4161.32 → 4162.24] Before he died
[4162.24 → 4162.86] He was in the garden
[4162.86 → 4163.54] He was crying
[4163.54 → 4164.28] And he was scared
[4164.28 → 4164.76] About everything
[4164.76 → 4165.66] He was going to go through
[4165.66 → 4166.92] He was very nervous
[4166.92 → 4168.08] About what he was going to face
[4168.08 → 4169.48] And so because Jesus
[4169.48 → 4170.90] Has felt all of those things
[4170.90 → 4172.46] He's able to help you
[4172.46 → 4173.36] And us all
[4173.36 → 4174.04] When we're feeling
[4174.04 → 4175.24] These things
[4175.24 → 4176.30] He's able to help us
[4176.30 → 4177.20] To go from shaking
[4177.20 → 4178.56] To unshakeable
[4178.56 → 4179.72] And now this is really
[4179.72 → 4180.44] Important for you gems
[4180.44 → 4180.80] Do you know why
[4180.80 → 4181.50] This is so important
[4181.50 → 4181.88] For you today
[4181.88 → 4182.54] And why this is such
[4182.54 → 4183.66] A cool thing we're doing today?
[4184.30 → 4185.12] So there's a group
[4185.12 → 4186.10] Called the Barn Group
[4186.10 → 4187.08] Church this is fascinating
[4187.08 → 4187.72] There's a group
[4187.72 → 4188.58] Called the Barn Group
[4188.58 → 4189.70] It's a big Christian group
[4189.70 → 4191.34] It does survey
[4191.34 → 4192.94] Across the United States
[4192.94 → 4194.10] Giant surveys
[4194.10 → 4195.30] They've concluded
[4195.30 → 4196.68] Through a bunch of their tests
[4196.68 → 4197.82] That Generation Z
[4197.82 → 4199.40] And Generation Z
[4199.40 → 4200.30] Is anybody who's like
[4200.30 → 4201.38] Seven years old
[4201.38 → 4203.04] To like 22-ish years old
[4203.04 → 4203.50] So somewhere
[4203.50 → 4204.66] And then the numbers
[4204.66 → 4205.20] Move around a little bit
[4205.20 → 4205.76] So you guys
[4205.76 → 4207.76] They've concluded
[4207.76 → 4208.78] That Generation Z
[4208.78 → 4210.34] That you are the first
[4210.34 → 4212.44] Truly post-Christian
[4212.44 → 4213.74] Generation in the West
[4213.74 → 4215.10] The first one
[4215.10 → 4217.12] They've concluded
[4217.12 → 4218.40] That only 4%
[4218.40 → 4219.54] Of Generation Z
[4219.54 → 4221.02] Adheres to a Biblical
[4221.02 → 4221.54] Worldview
[4221.54 → 4222.60] In the West
[4222.60 → 4223.98] 4%
[4223.98 → 4225.10] That is so small
[4225.10 → 4225.98] You know
[4225.98 → 4226.96] When I was your age
[4226.96 → 4227.94] And that's a sentence
[4227.94 → 4229.06] That only old people say
[4229.06 → 4230.64] When I was your age
[4230.64 → 4232.06] When I was your age
[4232.06 → 4233.06] We used to walk to school
[4233.06 → 4234.38] Uphill both ways
[4234.38 → 4236.62] And we had to eat dry bread
[4236.62 → 4237.12] And water
[4237.12 → 4238.18] And we used to fight
[4238.18 → 4238.84] With our fists
[4238.84 → 4238.90] With our fists
[4238.90 → 4240.08] Not the caps lock's key
[4240.08 → 4241.92] That's what people say
[4241.92 → 4242.36] When they're old
[4242.36 → 4244.12] But when I was your age
[4244.12 → 4246.64] That number wasn't 4%
[4246.64 → 4248.10] There was about 30-50%
[4248.10 → 4248.64] Of people
[4248.64 → 4250.62] Believed in God
[4250.62 → 4251.02] Or at least
[4251.02 → 4252.78] Adhered to a Biblical worldview
[4252.78 → 4254.12] Right now it's 4%
[4254.12 → 4255.42] So many people
[4255.42 → 4256.32] So many girls
[4256.32 → 4257.74] So many people your age
[4257.74 → 4258.68] Don't know about Jesus
[4258.68 → 4260.24] They don't see him
[4260.24 → 4261.82] As someone to turn to
[4261.82 → 4262.60] When we start shaking
[4262.60 → 4263.64] So many don't know
[4263.64 → 4264.82] That Jesus loves them
[4264.82 → 4267.06] In fact we just celebrated
[4267.06 → 4267.90] This last week
[4267.90 → 4269.22] And the week leading up to it
[4269.22 → 4270.60] But Jesus loves us so much
[4270.60 → 4271.76] That he came into this world
[4271.76 → 4272.24] For us
[4272.24 → 4273.38] He was God
[4273.38 → 4274.08] And then he became
[4274.08 → 4275.36] A person for us
[4275.36 → 4276.60] A person that got to experience
[4276.60 → 4277.28] All those feelings
[4277.28 → 4278.52] That maybe make us
[4278.52 → 4279.44] Make us a little bit of hurt
[4279.44 → 4281.32] He lived this perfect life
[4281.32 → 4281.88] For us
[4281.88 → 4283.00] And then he took on
[4283.00 → 4283.90] All of our sins
[4283.90 → 4286.42] And he forgave them all
[4286.42 → 4287.88] By dying on the cross
[4287.88 → 4288.42] For us
[4288.42 → 4289.18] And he did that
[4289.18 → 4289.88] For all of you
[4289.88 → 4290.36] And for me
[4290.36 → 4291.38] And for everybody here
[4291.38 → 4293.06] And then because Jesus
[4293.06 → 4294.52] Is so strong and unshakeable
[4294.52 → 4296.18] He rose again from the dead
[4296.18 → 4297.34] Three days later
[4297.34 → 4298.40] Coming to life
[4298.40 → 4300.08] Because not even death
[4300.08 → 4302.34] Was shaky enough for him
[4302.34 → 4303.08] Not even death
[4303.08 → 4304.12] Could stop him
[4304.12 → 4305.76] And then he rose again
[4305.76 → 4307.48] Defeating sin and death forever
[4307.48 → 4310.80] And as Psalm 62 says today
[4310.80 → 4311.88] He is our fortress
[4311.88 → 4312.86] Our rock
[4312.86 → 4314.38] And our salvation
[4314.38 → 4315.84] So when we put our hope in him
[4315.84 → 4316.18] We feel
[4316.18 → 4317.34] We feel
[4317.34 → 4319.00] When we feel shaken
[4319.00 → 4319.28] Sorry
[4319.28 → 4320.18] When we put our hope in him
[4320.18 → 4321.14] When we feel shaken
[4321.14 → 4322.12] And we don't put our hope
[4322.12 → 4322.78] In other people
[4322.78 → 4323.40] Or our friends
[4323.40 → 4323.96] Or our plans
[4323.96 → 4324.64] Or our vacations
[4324.64 → 4325.46] Or whatever else
[4325.46 → 4327.14] When we put our hope in Jesus
[4327.14 → 4329.04] We find that peace
[4329.04 → 4331.48] Because when we shake
[4331.48 → 4332.40] It's not us
[4332.40 → 4334.08] That stops us from shaking
[4334.08 → 4334.94] It's him
[4334.94 → 4335.56] It's Jesus
[4335.56 → 4336.62] He is the rock
[4336.62 → 4337.72] When life shakes
[4337.72 → 4338.66] He doesn't
[4338.66 → 4339.72] It's always Jesus
[4339.72 → 4340.78] That Sunday school answer
[4340.78 → 4341.20] Jesus
[4341.20 → 4342.22] That's the right answer
[4342.22 → 4343.08] Most of the time
[4343.08 → 4345.06] Now God made us
[4345.06 → 4345.64] A lot of promises
[4345.64 → 4346.10] In the Bible
[4346.10 → 4347.56] And he kept each one of them
[4347.56 → 4348.68] And he keeps each one of them
[4348.68 → 4349.14] But we're going to look
[4349.14 → 4350.54] At five promises today
[4350.54 → 4351.84] And I think they're five promises
[4351.84 → 4352.34] You know
[4352.34 → 4353.28] Because you helped us
[4353.28 → 4353.72] Through this
[4353.72 → 4354.16] At the beginning
[4354.16 → 4355.10] Of the service today
[4355.10 → 4355.98] So we're going to look
[4355.98 → 4356.70] At them right now
[4356.70 → 4357.44] Now
[4357.44 → 4359.20] Here's a secret
[4359.20 → 4360.44] I just kind of did
[4360.44 → 4361.24] A quick little look around
[4361.24 → 4362.50] And I saw a few of your parents
[4362.50 → 4363.42] Like check their watches
[4363.42 → 4364.52] So
[4364.52 → 4365.12] But we're going to look
[4365.12 → 4365.74] At five promises
[4365.74 → 4366.50] But it's only going to be
[4366.50 → 4367.32] Like a minute or two
[4367.32 → 4367.86] Each promise
[4367.86 → 4369.10] So it's not going to be very long
[4369.10 → 4369.88] But they can wait
[4369.88 → 4370.58] We're having fun
[4370.58 → 4370.80] Right?
[4370.88 → 4371.42] So that's fine
[4371.42 → 4371.62] Yeah
[4371.62 → 4372.00] They can
[4372.00 → 4372.20] Yeah
[4372.20 → 4372.86] That's what I thought
[4372.86 → 4374.54] Oh there's one more thing
[4374.54 → 4375.56] These five promises
[4375.56 → 4376.34] We read them already
[4376.34 → 4377.02] Today like I said
[4377.02 → 4377.24] So
[4377.24 → 4378.82] It's going to be more like
[4378.82 → 4379.50] Retention
[4379.50 → 4381.18] Like we're not learning new things
[4381.18 → 4382.20] We're retaining stuff
[4382.20 → 4383.00] That we've learned already
[4383.00 → 4383.72] Which is something I know
[4383.72 → 4384.56] That you guys are really
[4384.56 → 4385.14] Perfect at
[4385.14 → 4386.32] But maybe older generations
[4386.32 → 4386.94] Are less good at
[4386.94 → 4387.14] So
[4387.14 → 4388.28] They're going to listen too
[4388.28 → 4389.62] And be really good at remembering
[4389.62 → 4390.72] What we've talked about today
[4390.72 → 4390.98] Okay?
[4391.40 → 4391.60] So
[4391.60 → 4392.92] First promise is this
[4392.92 → 4393.70] Promise number one
[4393.70 → 4394.82] Jesus
[4394.82 → 4396.18] Is love
[4396.18 → 4397.66] And so the promise is
[4397.66 → 4398.56] You are loved
[4398.56 → 4399.72] Right?
[4399.84 → 4400.60] Jesus is love
[4400.60 → 4401.80] And so you are loved
[4401.80 → 4402.78] In fact you are loved
[4402.78 → 4404.04] By Jesus more than you will
[4404.04 → 4405.50] Ever know
[4405.50 → 4406.88] First John 3
[4406.88 → 4407.58] One says this
[4407.58 → 4409.22] See what great love
[4409.22 → 4410.74] The Father has lavished on us
[4410.74 → 4411.68] That we should be called
[4411.68 → 4413.10] Children of God
[4413.10 → 4415.06] And that is what we are
[4415.06 → 4416.42] That's what the Bible says
[4416.42 → 4417.32] That is what we are
[4417.32 → 4419.04] We are children of God
[4419.04 → 4420.80] God loves you so much
[4420.80 → 4421.70] Because you're his child
[4421.70 → 4422.94] Do you know that he knows you
[4422.94 → 4424.04] Better than anybody else?
[4424.84 → 4426.10] He knows you better than anyone
[4426.10 → 4427.06] More than your parents
[4427.06 → 4427.96] He knows you more than
[4427.96 → 4428.92] Your friends know you
[4428.92 → 4429.78] He knows you more than
[4429.78 → 4431.02] Your brothers or your sisters
[4431.02 → 4432.28] Even believe it or not
[4432.28 → 4433.26] Your gems counsellors
[4433.26 → 4434.64] He knows you more than
[4434.64 → 4435.20] Any of them
[4435.20 → 4435.80] Actually
[4435.80 → 4437.38] He knows you better
[4437.38 → 4439.32] Than you know you
[4439.32 → 4440.94] Did you know that?
[4441.14 → 4442.04] He knows you better
[4442.04 → 4442.98] Than you know you
[4442.98 → 4444.60] So here Olivia
[4444.60 → 4445.20] I'm going to pick on you
[4445.20 → 4445.50] For a second
[4445.50 → 4446.32] Olivia how many hairs
[4446.32 → 4447.00] Do you have on your head?
[4449.78 → 4450.52] Are you sure?
[4451.24 → 4452.04] How about you live?
[4452.06 → 4452.72] How many hairs do you have
[4452.72 → 4453.12] On your head?
[4454.84 → 4455.48] Any idea?
[4455.48 → 4455.94] No idea?
[4455.94 → 4456.52] How about you Zoe?
[4456.60 → 4457.00] Any idea?
[4457.62 → 4458.76] A hundred?
[4459.14 → 4460.14] I'm in my teens
[4460.14 → 4460.94] At this point
[4460.94 → 4461.40] So
[4461.40 → 4462.88] No, but you know what?
[4462.98 → 4464.44] God watches over you
[4464.44 → 4466.18] So God knows exactly
[4466.18 → 4467.38] How many hairs
[4467.38 → 4468.10] Are on your head
[4468.10 → 4469.26] He knows exactly
[4469.26 → 4469.86] How many hairs
[4469.86 → 4470.48] You have on your head
[4470.48 → 4471.86] And the Bible says this
[4471.86 → 4472.62] Not only does he know
[4472.62 → 4473.26] How many hairs
[4473.26 → 4473.94] Are on your head
[4473.94 → 4475.84] He watches over you
[4475.84 → 4476.52] So closely
[4476.52 → 4477.74] That not a hair
[4477.74 → 4479.06] Can fall from your head
[4479.06 → 4480.12] Without him willing it
[4480.12 → 4481.00] And knowing it
[4481.00 → 4482.70] Can any of your friends
[4482.70 → 4483.22] Do that?
[4484.02 → 4484.34] No
[4484.34 → 4485.88] Only God can
[4485.88 → 4486.56] Isn't that amazing?
[4486.86 → 4488.00] God knows you so well
[4488.00 → 4489.54] And he loves you so much
[4489.54 → 4490.16] That you will never
[4490.16 → 4491.34] Even really know it
[4491.34 → 4492.62] But
[4492.62 → 4494.04] You are loved
[4494.04 → 4495.82] By more than just God
[4495.82 → 4497.10] Can you do me a favour?
[4497.18 → 4497.62] You can sit down
[4497.62 → 4498.70] You have to look around the church
[4498.70 → 4499.48] Look around the church
[4499.48 → 4500.00] To everybody
[4500.00 → 4501.06] Kind of sitting around you here
[4501.06 → 4501.84] Do you see all these people?
[4502.84 → 4503.16] Do you see all them?
[4503.20 → 4504.06] Church you can do the same thing
[4504.06 → 4504.86] This is good for you too
[4504.86 → 4505.74] Look around this church
[4505.74 → 4506.60] Everybody
[4506.60 → 4509.40] Gems, girls
[4509.40 → 4510.88] You are loved by this community
[4510.88 → 4511.96] All of these people
[4511.96 → 4512.80] When you were baptized
[4512.80 → 4514.06] They promised this
[4514.06 → 4514.64] They promised that
[4514.64 → 4515.44] They would pray for you
[4515.44 → 4516.58] They promised that
[4516.58 → 4517.32] They would help you
[4517.32 → 4518.52] That they would encourage you
[4518.52 → 4519.46] That they would teach you
[4519.46 → 4520.08] They promised that
[4520.08 → 4521.02] They would love you
[4521.02 → 4522.52] And they do
[4522.52 → 4523.72] Look at your Gems counsellors
[4523.72 → 4524.52] They're in the back there
[4524.52 → 4525.10] You see them?
[4525.56 → 4526.56] Wave at your Gems counsellors
[4526.56 → 4527.70] There they are
[4527.70 → 4528.64] Do you know that
[4528.64 → 4530.10] They take a week
[4530.10 → 4530.66] Or a night
[4530.66 → 4532.30] Every 14 days
[4532.30 → 4533.02] They take a night
[4533.02 → 4533.84] Of their evening
[4533.84 → 4535.28] To hang out with you
[4535.28 → 4536.24] To teach you
[4536.24 → 4537.48] To sing and dance with you
[4537.48 → 4538.04] To play games
[4538.04 → 4538.56] To make crafts
[4538.56 → 4539.82] They feed you ice cream
[4539.82 → 4540.96] And caramel sauce
[4540.96 → 4541.66] And orbits
[4541.66 → 4542.68] And cream soda
[4542.68 → 4543.78] And I know they do this
[4543.78 → 4544.88] Because my daughter comes home
[4544.88 → 4546.66] All wired after every two weeks
[4546.66 → 4548.08] And it's wonderful
[4548.08 → 4551.12] But they do this
[4551.12 → 4554.04] Because she is
[4554.04 → 4555.36] They do this though
[4555.36 → 4556.72] Because they love you
[4556.72 → 4557.84] Isn't that wonderful?
[4558.06 → 4559.24] This is actually a perfect part
[4559.24 → 4559.88] Of the service church
[4559.88 → 4560.54] Where we can give them
[4560.54 → 4561.48] A round of applause
[4561.48 → 4562.34] For all the work
[4562.34 → 4563.76] That these Gems counsellors do
[4563.76 → 4569.58] And everybody feels so led
[4569.58 → 4570.72] I know that they like coffee
[4570.72 → 4571.20] And Tidbits
[4571.20 → 4571.96] And stuff like that too
[4571.96 → 4572.86] So if you really want to go
[4572.86 → 4573.74] And thank a Gems counsellor
[4573.74 → 4574.84] It's a good way to do that
[4574.84 → 4575.80] So Gems
[4575.80 → 4576.30] You girls
[4576.30 → 4577.56] You're loved so much
[4577.56 → 4578.56] You're loved by God
[4578.56 → 4579.38] You're loved by Jesus
[4579.38 → 4580.64] You're loved by this church
[4580.64 → 4581.64] These Gems counsellors
[4581.64 → 4582.92] Just know that
[4582.92 → 4583.78] Know that that promise
[4583.78 → 4584.26] Is true
[4584.26 → 4584.86] That you are loved
[4584.86 → 4585.62] So that's the first promise
[4585.62 → 4586.36] Jesus is love
[4586.36 → 4587.74] And so you are loved
[4587.74 → 4588.62] Promise number two
[4588.62 → 4590.24] Jesus died
[4590.24 → 4592.08] And so you are forgiven
[4592.08 → 4593.98] Your sins are forgiven
[4593.98 → 4595.40] Have you guys ever made a mistake?
[4596.64 → 4597.00] Yeah
[4597.00 → 4597.48] Oh big
[4597.48 → 4598.46] Big head nods
[4598.46 → 4599.48] We're very aware
[4599.48 → 4600.06] Of the mistakes
[4600.06 → 4600.30] Hey
[4600.30 → 4601.44] Have you ever felt
[4601.44 → 4602.30] Like you've done something
[4602.30 → 4603.12] Maybe so bad
[4603.12 → 4604.14] That you might not be able
[4604.14 → 4604.82] To get out of it
[4604.82 → 4605.56] That people might not
[4605.56 → 4606.38] Forgive you for it?
[4606.80 → 4607.04] Yeah
[4607.04 → 4607.66] A couple of times
[4607.66 → 4608.26] Have you ever done
[4608.26 → 4608.86] Something so bad
[4608.86 → 4609.14] And thought
[4609.14 → 4610.00] Nobody's going to
[4610.00 → 4610.96] Understand me anymore
[4610.96 → 4611.54] Or they're going to
[4611.54 → 4612.28] They're just going to
[4612.28 → 4612.88] Look at me as like
[4612.88 → 4613.64] The person who
[4613.64 → 4614.42] Who lied
[4614.42 → 4614.92] Or who cheated
[4614.92 → 4616.38] Or who was angry
[4616.38 → 4617.54] Have you ever felt
[4617.54 → 4618.12] That way before?
[4618.12 → 4620.00] Did you know
[4620.00 → 4620.50] That that's not
[4620.50 → 4621.62] How forgiveness works?
[4622.82 → 4623.36] You know that's not
[4623.36 → 4623.90] How forgiveness works?
[4623.96 → 4625.20] Back in first John
[4625.20 → 4625.70] Verse nine
[4625.70 → 4626.24] It says this
[4626.24 → 4626.50] It says
[4626.50 → 4627.70] If we confess our sins
[4627.70 → 4629.18] He is faithful and just
[4629.18 → 4629.94] And he will forgive us
[4629.94 → 4630.38] Our sins
[4630.38 → 4631.70] And purify
[4631.70 → 4633.00] You know what purify means?
[4633.92 → 4635.14] Like completely get rid of
[4635.14 → 4636.24] Like erase completely
[4636.24 → 4637.14] Purify us
[4637.14 → 4638.66] From all of our righteousness
[4638.66 → 4640.84] So when Jesus forgives
[4640.84 → 4641.36] Our sins
[4641.36 → 4642.34] It's like they never happened
[4642.34 → 4644.20] It's like they never happened
[4644.20 → 4645.12] Because Jesus died
[4645.12 → 4646.00] To forgive all our sins
[4646.00 → 4646.84] When we confess them
[4646.84 → 4647.26] To Jesus
[4647.26 → 4648.10] And ask for forgiveness
[4648.10 → 4649.26] It's like we never sinned
[4649.26 → 4649.46] At all
[4649.46 → 4650.06] Okay look at this
[4650.06 → 4651.26] Want to see something cool?
[4652.92 → 4653.48] Who opah!
[4655.76 → 4656.12] What?
[4656.64 → 4657.14] What a
[4657.14 → 4657.90] This is the future
[4657.90 → 4658.56] We're living in
[4658.56 → 4659.04] Isn't it?
[4659.70 → 4660.90] What a fancy thing
[4660.90 → 4662.66] Here's a list of some sins
[4662.66 → 4663.88] Alright so we've got
[4663.88 → 4664.44] Like teasing
[4664.44 → 4665.20] Disrespecting
[4665.20 → 4666.02] Refusing to share lying
[4666.02 → 4666.94] There's a bunch there
[4666.94 → 4667.82] Some of you maybe
[4667.82 → 4668.70] Do some of these things
[4668.70 → 4669.08] Sometimes
[4669.08 → 4669.40] Anybody?
[4669.60 → 4670.44] Church put up your hand
[4670.44 → 4671.08] If you've done any
[4671.08 → 4671.96] Of these things before
[4671.96 → 4673.24] Look around gems
[4673.24 → 4673.88] You're not alone
[4673.88 → 4676.14] Alright, but you know
[4676.14 → 4676.70] What happens when
[4676.70 → 4677.52] Jesus forgives them?
[4677.52 → 4678.82] It's not like this
[4678.82 → 4679.42] It's not like they're
[4679.42 → 4680.36] Just kind of there
[4680.36 → 4681.38] It's not like
[4681.38 → 4682.38] Oh yeah you didn't do it
[4682.38 → 4682.96] But it's still there
[4682.96 → 4683.88] He actually like
[4683.88 → 4685.22] Erases them
[4685.22 → 4686.56] Like they're gone
[4686.56 → 4688.26] Like there's no mark
[4688.26 → 4688.88] Of them to go
[4688.88 → 4689.86] Because when you ask
[4689.86 → 4690.88] Jesus to forgive you
[4690.88 → 4691.60] For your sins
[4691.60 → 4692.90] I wish I had a perfect
[4692.90 → 4693.20] Eraser
[4693.20 → 4694.06] This image would be
[4694.06 → 4694.74] So much better than
[4694.74 → 4695.86] But when you ask
[4695.86 → 4696.88] Jesus to forgive you
[4696.88 → 4697.56] Of your sins
[4697.56 → 4698.86] It's like they never
[4698.86 → 4699.44] Existed
[4699.44 → 4700.60] It's like they're
[4700.60 → 4701.60] Not even there
[4701.60 → 4702.72] See that?
[4703.48 → 4704.62] And they go away
[4704.62 → 4707.28] And every time you sin
[4707.28 → 4708.36] And every time you ask
[4708.36 → 4709.14] God for forgiveness
[4709.14 → 4710.24] When you feel terrible
[4710.24 → 4711.02] About what you did
[4711.02 → 4711.72] And you say
[4711.72 → 4712.86] Jesus please forgive me
[4712.86 → 4713.52] He says okay
[4713.52 → 4715.42] And then your sins are gone
[4715.42 → 4716.54] And you are forgiven
[4716.54 → 4719.34] And there's no more sin left
[4719.34 → 4720.00] Isn't that something?
[4720.10 → 4720.90] That's what it's like
[4720.90 → 4721.68] When we are forgiven
[4721.68 → 4722.44] And so
[4722.44 → 4724.08] Don't be ashamed
[4724.08 → 4725.40] Don't let your guilt
[4725.40 → 4726.40] Cause you to shake
[4726.40 → 4726.96] When you've done
[4726.96 → 4727.70] Something wrong
[4727.70 → 4729.28] Jesus forgives you
[4729.28 → 4731.38] Your sins don't define
[4731.38 → 4732.30] Who you are
[4732.30 → 4734.06] Only God defines
[4734.06 → 4734.74] Who you are
[4734.74 → 4735.60] And he defines you
[4735.60 → 4736.16] As forgiven
[4736.16 → 4737.96] So promise one
[4737.96 → 4738.32] You're loved
[4738.32 → 4738.78] Promise two
[4738.78 → 4739.26] You're forgiven
[4739.26 → 4740.22] Promise three
[4740.22 → 4741.28] You're not alone
[4741.28 → 4743.32] Jesus has risen
[4743.32 → 4744.88] And so you are not alone
[4744.88 → 4745.86] Sometimes we do feel
[4745.86 → 4746.52] Alone in this world
[4746.52 → 4746.72] Right?
[4746.80 → 4747.56] Like sometimes
[4747.56 → 4748.24] When there's no one
[4748.24 → 4748.62] With you
[4748.62 → 4749.70] Like you feel like
[4749.70 → 4750.10] There's no one
[4750.10 → 4751.06] That understands you
[4751.06 → 4752.40] But Jesus rose again
[4752.40 → 4752.98] From the dead
[4752.98 → 4753.64] And he ascended
[4753.64 → 4754.22] Into heaven
[4754.22 → 4754.94] And he sent his
[4754.94 → 4755.64] Holy Spirit
[4755.64 → 4756.66] To be with all of us
[4756.66 → 4758.12] Jesus is always
[4758.12 → 4758.88] With you gems
[4758.88 → 4759.78] Jesus is always
[4759.78 → 4760.42] With you
[4760.42 → 4761.06] Even if he seems
[4761.06 → 4761.52] Far away
[4761.52 → 4762.42] Even if you forget
[4762.42 → 4763.48] That he's there
[4763.48 → 4764.62] He is beside you
[4764.62 → 4765.42] He was with you
[4765.42 → 4766.50] Deuteronomy 31
[4766.50 → 4767.22] 6 says this
[4767.22 → 4769.26] Be strong and courageous
[4769.26 → 4770.20] Do not be afraid
[4770.20 → 4770.82] Or terrified
[4770.82 → 4771.50] Because of them
[4771.50 → 4772.60] For the Lord your God
[4772.60 → 4773.60] Goes with you
[4773.60 → 4774.26] And listen to this
[4774.26 → 4775.54] He will never
[4775.54 → 4776.52] Leave you
[4776.52 → 4777.86] Or forsake you
[4777.86 → 4779.12] He is with you
[4779.12 → 4779.98] He will never leave you
[4779.98 → 4781.02] Even in shaky times
[4781.02 → 4782.00] Actually especially
[4782.00 → 4782.94] In shaky times
[4782.94 → 4784.12] He is with you
[4784.12 → 4785.48] You can pray to him
[4785.48 → 4786.34] You can call on him
[4786.34 → 4787.16] You can lean on him
[4787.16 → 4787.86] Because he's with you
[4787.86 → 4788.50] And again now
[4788.50 → 4789.24] Look around this place
[4789.24 → 4789.92] It's not just Jesus
[4789.92 → 4790.52] That's with you
[4790.52 → 4791.76] It's not just Jesus
[4791.76 → 4792.30] That makes sure
[4792.30 → 4792.78] You're not alone
[4792.78 → 4793.48] Look around this church
[4793.48 → 4793.74] Again
[4793.74 → 4795.02] You see all these people
[4795.02 → 4797.48] If you ever feel lonely
[4797.48 → 4798.14] Pray to God
[4798.14 → 4800.26] Seek out someone
[4800.26 → 4801.40] Who you trust as well
[4801.40 → 4802.14] You can talk to a
[4802.14 → 4802.72] Gems counsellor
[4802.72 → 4803.14] A parent
[4803.14 → 4803.52] A friend
[4803.52 → 4804.88] A pastor
[4804.88 → 4805.82] We're all here
[4805.82 → 4806.68] And that's what church is
[4806.68 → 4807.74] A family
[4807.74 → 4808.64] God has given us
[4808.64 → 4809.60] Each other
[4809.60 → 4810.64] I'm going to talk
[4810.64 → 4811.42] To the church for a second
[4811.42 → 4812.06] You guys are included
[4812.06 → 4812.32] In that
[4812.32 → 4812.84] But church
[4812.84 → 4814.78] This is your calling
[4814.78 → 4815.16] To
[4815.16 → 4817.14] This is your calling
[4817.14 → 4818.02] To be there
[4818.02 → 4819.36] For people who feel lonely
[4819.36 → 4820.78] Pray to God
[4820.78 → 4823.72] Let him stir in your heart
[4823.72 → 4824.52] To point out those
[4824.52 → 4825.22] That need someone
[4825.22 → 4826.14] Don't let this message
[4826.14 → 4826.90] Fly over your heads
[4826.90 → 4827.84] Because I'm standing here
[4827.84 → 4828.98] Talking to these girls
[4828.98 → 4829.78] This is for you
[4829.78 → 4830.88] This is for all of us
[4830.88 → 4832.60] We have jobs
[4832.60 → 4833.72] We have a responsibility
[4833.72 → 4835.30] As members of God's church
[4835.30 → 4836.40] To be there for someone
[4836.40 → 4837.76] To seek out the lonely
[4837.76 → 4838.52] And the lost
[4838.52 → 4839.10] So be there
[4839.10 → 4840.36] Open your doors
[4840.36 → 4842.20] Invite each other in
[4842.20 → 4843.84] Don't let the disease
[4843.84 → 4844.46] Of loneliness
[4844.46 → 4845.88] That's spreading like crazy
[4845.88 → 4846.42] In our culture
[4846.42 → 4847.30] Because we live in this
[4847.30 → 4849.06] Such an individualistic culture
[4849.06 → 4850.56] And we're so attached
[4850.56 → 4851.42] To social media
[4851.42 → 4852.64] Which just distances us
[4852.64 → 4853.16] From other people
[4853.16 → 4854.20] Don't let your brothers
[4854.20 → 4855.78] And sisters in this place
[4855.78 → 4856.76] Feel lonely
[4856.76 → 4857.86] Like they have no one
[4857.86 → 4860.08] Think beyond our social circles
[4860.08 → 4861.24] Reach out to those
[4861.24 → 4861.60] Who are strong
[4861.60 → 4862.50] Reach out to the widows
[4862.50 → 4863.72] Reach out to the downtrodden
[4863.72 → 4864.88] Reach out to the lonely
[4864.88 → 4865.28] The young
[4865.28 → 4865.80] The old
[4865.80 → 4868.38] Think about those amongst you
[4868.38 → 4869.12] That need a friend
[4869.12 → 4869.88] And if you're not sure
[4869.88 → 4870.84] If someone needs a friend
[4870.84 → 4871.60] Assume they do
[4871.60 → 4873.92] Be there for each other
[4873.92 → 4874.76] One of these things
[4874.76 → 4875.82] We've done this last month
[4875.82 → 4876.38] Is treat tag
[4876.38 → 4877.22] And I know that's a silly thing
[4877.22 → 4878.16] To segue to right now
[4878.16 → 4879.36] But use this week
[4879.36 → 4880.22] Of treat tag church
[4880.22 → 4881.18] To go and bless someone
[4881.18 → 4882.98] It's like a brilliant excuse
[4882.98 → 4884.38] To go and show someone
[4884.38 → 4885.30] That you're thinking of them
[4885.30 → 4888.38] To go and slay this dragon
[4888.38 → 4889.14] Of loneliness
[4889.14 → 4890.54] In our culture
[4890.54 → 4891.80] Alright Jem
[4891.80 → 4892.64] Sorry I'm back to you now
[4892.64 → 4893.34] I think I've talked
[4893.34 → 4894.00] To everybody good enough
[4894.00 → 4894.36] Is that good?
[4894.70 → 4895.62] Alright so you're loved
[4895.62 → 4896.10] You're forgiven
[4896.10 → 4896.82] You're not alone
[4896.82 → 4897.96] Number four
[4897.96 → 4898.98] Jem
[4898.98 → 4900.22] You are strong
[4900.22 → 4901.74] Jesus is victorious
[4901.74 → 4903.66] And so through him
[4903.66 → 4904.56] You are strong
[4904.56 → 4906.06] Now listen to this
[4906.06 → 4906.62] This is important
[4906.62 → 4907.90] Each of you
[4907.90 → 4909.88] Are super, super strong
[4909.88 → 4910.78] But what I'm not
[4910.78 → 4912.00] Talking about right now
[4912.00 → 4913.32] Is like girl power
[4913.32 → 4914.60] Like girl power
[4914.60 → 4915.34] I don't know
[4915.34 → 4915.70] What's it
[4915.70 → 4916.42] Fist
[4916.42 → 4917.82] Fist
[4917.82 → 4918.74] Yeah girl power
[4918.74 → 4920.24] I don't know what it is
[4920.24 → 4922.18] Is that not good?
[4922.48 → 4923.18] Was that embarrassing?
[4923.18 → 4923.66] Yeah
[4923.66 → 4926.34] So this is not girl power
[4926.34 → 4926.98] And you know why
[4926.98 → 4927.86] That's not girl power?
[4928.00 → 4928.56] And please hear
[4928.56 → 4929.18] What I'm saying here
[4929.18 → 4930.20] You're not strong
[4930.20 → 4931.64] Because you're a girl
[4931.64 → 4933.14] Just like I'm not strong
[4933.14 → 4934.62] Because I'm a man
[4934.62 → 4935.62] Who's shaped like
[4935.62 → 4936.68] A sturdy bag of flour
[4936.68 → 4939.58] You are strong
[4939.58 → 4941.36] You are strong
[4941.36 → 4942.38] Not because of you
[4942.38 → 4943.68] And I am strong
[4943.68 → 4944.50] Not because of me
[4944.50 → 4945.40] But we are strong
[4945.40 → 4946.24] Because of Jesus
[4946.24 → 4948.78] Nothing is too hard
[4948.78 → 4949.26] For Jesus
[4949.26 → 4950.90] He reigns victoriously
[4950.90 → 4951.38] Over this world
[4951.38 → 4952.72] John 16 33 says
[4952.72 → 4953.60] In this world
[4953.60 → 4954.76] We will have trouble
[4954.76 → 4956.00] But I
[4956.00 → 4956.42] Jesus
[4956.42 → 4957.96] Jesus has overcome
[4957.96 → 4958.78] The world
[4958.78 → 4960.06] So that's why
[4960.06 → 4961.54] This isn't a girl power thing
[4961.54 → 4963.00] But this is still
[4963.00 → 4963.78] The truth for you
[4963.78 → 4965.00] Not because you're a girl
[4965.00 → 4965.92] Or not because you're a boy
[4965.92 → 4966.72] Or a man or a woman
[4966.72 → 4967.90] But because
[4967.90 → 4968.86] We love Jesus
[4968.86 → 4970.30] The problem is
[4970.30 → 4971.22] If you think you're strong
[4971.22 → 4971.92] Enough on your own
[4971.92 → 4973.00] To overcome the world
[4973.00 → 4973.96] You're eventually
[4973.96 → 4974.66] Going to shake
[4974.66 → 4975.74] With the burden of the world
[4975.74 → 4976.34] On your shoulders
[4976.34 → 4976.82] And crumble
[4976.82 → 4978.04] Because you're going to
[4978.04 → 4978.66] Then start to think
[4978.66 → 4979.22] That maybe you're not
[4979.22 → 4979.84] Strong enough
[4979.84 → 4981.50] And that's going to
[4981.50 → 4982.60] Start to feel terrible
[4982.60 → 4985.20] But if you recognize
[4985.20 → 4986.26] The power of Jesus
[4986.26 → 4987.50] And the fact that
[4987.50 → 4988.58] He's already overcome
[4988.58 → 4989.30] The world
[4989.30 → 4991.24] He's already victorious
[4991.24 → 4992.28] That weight goes away
[4992.28 → 4993.56] Because it's now not
[4993.56 → 4994.28] What you can do
[4994.28 → 4995.12] To overcome the problem
[4995.12 → 4996.14] It's what he's already done
[4996.14 → 4997.68] To overcome the problem
[4997.68 → 4998.62] All right
[4998.62 → 4999.62] We have to look to him
[4999.62 → 5001.08] Don't look to you
[5001.08 → 5001.50] For strength
[5001.50 → 5002.04] Look to him
[5002.04 → 5003.18] We can remember
[5003.18 → 5003.68] What he did
[5003.68 → 5004.30] And realize that
[5004.30 → 5004.92] One day he's going to
[5004.92 → 5005.38] Come again
[5005.38 → 5006.26] And we're going to
[5006.26 → 5006.94] All be with him
[5006.94 → 5007.48] And then
[5007.48 → 5008.42] You'll remember
[5008.42 → 5009.58] How strong you are
[5009.58 → 5010.62] Because we are strong
[5010.62 → 5011.42] And we can overcome
[5011.42 → 5011.82] The world
[5011.82 → 5012.66] But we can only do it
[5012.66 → 5013.88] With Jesus
[5013.88 → 5015.28] He has overcome
[5015.28 → 5015.74] The world
[5015.74 → 5017.20] Christ is victorious
[5017.20 → 5018.62] And so you are strong
[5018.62 → 5019.24] And now finally
[5019.24 → 5019.80] The last one
[5019.80 → 5020.54] The fifth promise
[5020.54 → 5022.88] Jesus changed the world
[5022.88 → 5024.78] And so you
[5024.78 → 5026.26] Are world changers
[5026.26 → 5027.48] Now again
[5027.48 → 5028.74] I want to frame this properly
[5028.74 → 5029.60] I'm not saying
[5029.60 → 5029.98] That you're going to
[5029.98 → 5030.72] Be able to accomplish
[5030.72 → 5031.92] Anything you want to do
[5031.92 → 5032.22] In life
[5032.22 → 5033.18] Simply by dreaming it
[5033.18 → 5034.16] And change the world
[5034.16 → 5034.56] That way
[5034.56 → 5035.86] That doesn't always work
[5035.86 → 5036.64] I've tried that already
[5036.64 → 5038.14] I wanted to be a professional
[5038.14 → 5038.80] Basketball player
[5038.80 → 5039.38] But here we are
[5039.38 → 5041.20] The NBA wasn't looking
[5041.20 → 5041.90] For people who had
[5041.90 → 5042.84] The vertical of a walrus
[5042.84 → 5043.22] So
[5043.22 → 5046.18] Now you should always
[5046.18 → 5047.00] Strive for excellence
[5047.00 → 5048.02] For sure you should
[5048.02 → 5048.80] You should always
[5048.80 → 5049.40] Strive for excellence
[5049.40 → 5050.46] You should work hard
[5050.46 → 5051.22] You should
[5051.22 → 5052.30] You should try to
[5052.30 → 5052.96] Improve yourself
[5052.96 → 5053.90] And you should stretch yourself
[5053.90 → 5054.24] And you should
[5054.24 → 5054.94] All those things
[5054.94 → 5056.54] But you can't simply
[5056.54 → 5057.90] Dream things into existence
[5057.90 → 5058.36] Either
[5058.36 → 5059.64] That's not a good life motto
[5059.64 → 5061.50] But you can change the world
[5061.50 → 5062.48] Do you know how?
[5063.48 → 5065.30] By changing other people's worlds
[5065.30 → 5067.02] All right?
[5067.56 → 5068.96] By changing other people's worlds
[5068.96 → 5069.82] Here, here's a question
[5069.82 → 5070.90] Micah 6 verse 8
[5070.90 → 5072.18] The ultimate gems verse
[5072.18 → 5072.92] On the planet
[5072.92 → 5074.46] Can anyone say it?
[5074.52 → 5075.18] Anyone in the church?
[5075.24 → 5075.54] Here we go
[5075.54 → 5076.92] What does the Lord require of you?
[5077.26 → 5079.52] To act justly love, mercy
[5079.52 → 5082.02] And walk humbly with your God
[5082.02 → 5083.98] Micah 6 verse 8
[5083.98 → 5084.36] Brilliant
[5084.36 → 5085.98] Brilliant
[5085.98 → 5086.92] Okay, yeah
[5086.92 → 5087.44] What's your question?
[5088.76 → 5089.24] A widow?
[5089.42 → 5090.22] That's someone who's lost
[5090.22 → 5091.18] Their husband or their wife
[5091.18 → 5092.54] So they were married
[5092.54 → 5093.78] And then their one spouse
[5093.78 → 5094.34] Passed away
[5094.34 → 5095.32] And so now they're a widow
[5095.32 → 5096.00] Now they don't have
[5096.00 → 5097.44] Their spouse anymore
[5097.44 → 5098.44] So it's important for us
[5098.44 → 5099.28] To take care of
[5099.28 → 5100.02] Their widows
[5100.02 → 5101.42] Their husband or their wife
[5101.42 → 5101.98] Yeah
[5101.98 → 5103.34] So that's why Jesus says
[5103.34 → 5104.24] Take care of those people
[5104.24 → 5105.12] Because sometimes they feel
[5105.12 → 5106.00] A little bit lonely, right?
[5106.54 → 5107.42] Because they used to have someone
[5107.42 → 5108.14] And then they don't
[5108.14 → 5108.68] So that's what we're
[5108.68 → 5109.24] Talking about there
[5109.24 → 5110.16] So make sure to take care
[5110.16 → 5111.14] Of the people who feel lonely
[5111.14 → 5112.90] All right, Micah 6 verse 8
[5112.90 → 5113.70] You just read it
[5113.70 → 5115.62] When we act justly
[5115.62 → 5117.36] When we love mercy
[5117.36 → 5118.66] When we walk humbly with God
[5118.66 → 5120.58] We will change people's lives
[5120.58 → 5121.94] So when you show mercy
[5121.94 → 5123.38] To someone in the name of Jesus
[5123.38 → 5124.78] Like when you're kind to them
[5124.78 → 5125.62] And you forgive them
[5125.62 → 5127.20] You show them the power
[5127.20 → 5127.78] Of forgiveness
[5127.78 → 5129.26] And their troubles
[5129.26 → 5129.82] Start to go away
[5129.82 → 5131.18] When you act justly to someone
[5131.18 → 5132.26] When you right a wrong
[5132.26 → 5133.00] In this world
[5133.00 → 5134.38] You empower them
[5134.38 → 5135.20] In the name of Jesus
[5135.20 → 5136.58] And they start to feel better
[5136.58 → 5137.32] About who they are
[5137.32 → 5138.82] When you walk humbly with God
[5138.82 → 5139.92] When you give God the credit
[5139.92 → 5141.12] For the things in this life
[5141.12 → 5142.36] People will notice that
[5142.36 → 5143.56] And then God gets glorified
[5143.56 → 5144.18] And people will be like
[5144.18 → 5145.96] Oh, this God seems pretty great
[5145.96 → 5148.48] So when you live these lives of love
[5148.48 → 5149.60] As God's called us to
[5149.60 → 5150.80] People are going to start noticing
[5150.80 → 5151.50] And the Holy Spirit
[5151.50 → 5152.50] Will change their hearts
[5152.50 → 5153.84] So that's our job
[5153.84 → 5155.44] We're supposed to go love people
[5155.44 → 5156.78] We're supposed to be present
[5156.78 → 5157.86] For people who are alone
[5157.86 → 5158.30] Or afraid
[5158.30 → 5159.46] We're supposed to be strong
[5159.46 → 5160.64] For someone who's feeling weak
[5160.64 → 5162.24] We're supposed to forgive each other
[5162.24 → 5163.60] Be kind to your parents
[5163.60 → 5164.14] Your siblings
[5164.14 → 5164.64] Your friends
[5164.64 → 5165.22] Your classmates
[5165.22 → 5166.30] Your employees
[5166.30 → 5166.94] Your neighbours
[5166.94 → 5167.66] Church
[5167.66 → 5169.16] Again, fill in the blank here
[5169.16 → 5171.42] Know that God is with you
[5171.42 → 5173.28] And let others know that too
[5173.28 → 5174.90] So that's how you will change the world
[5174.90 → 5176.86] And this change then happens in the world
[5176.86 → 5177.90] But also goes into eternity
[5177.90 → 5178.78] So that's it
[5178.78 → 5179.72] To conclude
[5179.72 → 5180.64] A couple more things
[5180.64 → 5180.98] You ready?
[5181.08 → 5182.06] Did anybody notice this?
[5182.34 → 5183.46] These five promises
[5183.46 → 5185.48] These five promises
[5185.48 → 5186.58] Are the gospel message
[5186.58 → 5188.34] You know what the gospel message is?
[5188.94 → 5189.98] Jesus loved you
[5189.98 → 5191.38] And so he died for you
[5191.38 → 5192.92] He rose again for you
[5192.92 → 5195.16] He was victorious over sin and death for you
[5195.16 → 5196.44] And now
[5196.44 → 5198.10] And then he changed the world
[5198.10 → 5199.62] And those are the promises
[5199.62 → 5200.30] Because of that
[5200.30 → 5201.16] We know we are loved
[5201.16 → 5202.30] We know we're forgiven
[5202.30 → 5203.78] We know we're not alone
[5203.78 → 5205.22] We know we are strong
[5205.22 → 5206.36] And we know that through Jesus
[5206.36 → 5207.58] We can change the world
[5207.58 → 5208.68] That's the gospel truth
[5208.68 → 5210.36] That's the gospel truth
[5210.36 → 5212.82] And Jim, some of you sit in the sanctuary every week
[5212.82 → 5213.18] That's true
[5213.18 → 5214.72] Some of you, they'll go to children's worship time too
[5214.72 → 5215.36] But did you know this?
[5215.74 → 5216.46] Every week
[5216.46 → 5217.80] Pastor Chris or myself
[5217.80 → 5218.28] Or whoever
[5218.28 → 5219.46] Whatever pastor is here
[5219.46 → 5221.42] We preach that message
[5221.42 → 5222.22] Every week
[5222.22 → 5224.22] Every single week
[5224.22 → 5224.86] And do you know why?
[5226.20 → 5229.16] Because it matters so, so, so much
[5229.16 → 5230.62] That is the reason we preach it
[5230.62 → 5232.32] Because it matters so much
[5232.32 → 5234.06] It changes our lives
[5234.06 → 5235.48] And because we actually
[5235.48 → 5236.54] We forget it
[5236.54 → 5238.28] We all forget it
[5238.28 → 5239.66] It's hard to remember on Monday
[5239.66 → 5242.76] But that's why we need to read our Bibles
[5242.76 → 5243.92] That's why we need to pray every day
[5243.92 → 5245.20] Again, these are such simple messages
[5245.20 → 5246.36] But it's so important
[5246.36 → 5248.48] The gospel truth of Jesus
[5248.48 → 5249.68] Is that he loved you so much
[5249.68 → 5250.20] That he lived
[5250.20 → 5250.94] He died
[5250.94 → 5251.80] He rose again
[5251.80 → 5253.04] Victoriously from the grave
[5253.04 → 5254.76] And he changed the world forever
[5254.76 → 5255.64] We need to remember that
[5255.64 → 5255.84] Yeah?
[5255.96 → 5256.32] You agree?
[5257.38 → 5257.66] Yeah?
[5257.96 → 5258.20] Yeah?
[5258.20 → 5258.60] Good
[5258.60 → 5259.04] Alright
[5259.04 → 5260.50] So if you're ever feeling sad
[5260.50 → 5260.90] Or alone
[5260.90 → 5261.32] Or afraid
[5261.32 → 5261.92] Or ashamed
[5261.92 → 5263.70] If anything causes you to shake
[5263.70 → 5265.20] Remember that God's your rock
[5265.20 → 5266.22] And your fortress
[5266.22 → 5267.18] And our hope is in him
[5267.18 → 5269.24] He is what is unshakeable
[5269.24 → 5270.40] So you're loved
[5270.40 → 5271.64] You're forgiven
[5271.64 → 5272.56] You're not alone
[5272.56 → 5273.68] You're strong
[5273.68 → 5275.58] All because of Jesus
[5275.58 → 5277.04] So should we go change the world?
[5277.94 → 5278.34] Yeah?
[5278.50 → 5278.68] Okay
[5278.68 → 5279.24] Let me pray
[5279.24 → 5280.84] And I think we're going to sing a song
[5280.84 → 5282.30] And then we'll close
[5282.30 → 5282.52] Okay?
[5282.96 → 5283.52] Let's fold our hands
[5283.52 → 5283.98] Close our eyes
[5283.98 → 5284.54] Let's pray church
[5284.54 → 5285.98] Father in heaven
[5285.98 → 5286.80] And we thank you so much
[5286.80 → 5288.32] For this gospel truth of Jesus
[5288.32 → 5290.12] That you have come to this earth
[5290.12 → 5291.52] You forgave us our sins
[5291.52 → 5293.18] You died and rose again for us
[5293.18 → 5295.08] And that you have changed the world
[5295.08 → 5295.80] And we pray God
[5295.80 → 5298.16] That as we go out into this week
[5298.16 → 5299.54] We go to school
[5299.54 → 5300.18] We go to work
[5300.18 → 5301.02] Wherever we end up going
[5301.02 → 5302.22] That we will remember that truth
[5302.22 → 5304.78] And that we will remember
[5304.78 → 5305.54] That we are not alone
[5305.54 → 5306.90] That we are forgiven
[5306.90 → 5308.12] That we are loved
[5308.12 → 5309.56] And that we are strong
[5309.56 → 5311.20] We pray that you will help us
[5311.20 → 5312.10] Remember all of those things
[5312.10 → 5312.54] In your name
[5312.54 → 5313.00] Amen
[5313.00 → 5330.50] Please stand with us
[5330.50 → 5332.22] As we sing this song
[5332.22 → 5333.06] My Lighthouse
[5333.06 → 5347.12] In my wrestling
[5347.12 → 5349.36] In my doubts
[5349.36 → 5351.66] In my failures
[5351.66 → 5353.84] You won't walk out
[5353.84 → 5355.86] Your great love
[5355.86 → 5358.18] Will lead me through
[5358.18 → 5360.48] You are the peace
[5360.48 → 5362.52] In my troubled sea
[5362.52 → 5363.06] Oh
[5363.06 → 5364.98] You are the peace
[5364.98 → 5367.00] In my troubled sea
[5367.00 → 5373.18] In the silence
[5373.18 → 5375.32] You won't let go
[5375.32 → 5377.72] In the questions
