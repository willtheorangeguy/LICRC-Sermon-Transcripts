[30.00 --> 39.76]  I'm glad you think that they do the culture and that I do.
[39.76 --> 41.10]  Oh, so which one do I do?
[43.38 --> 44.78]  Henry, come to me last night.
[48.62 --> 51.22]  I like the revelation song, which we did at the very beginning.
[60.00 --> 62.08]  It's going to be short, right?
[62.20 --> 64.60]  So we want something that we can chop pretty short.
[65.94 --> 68.46]  Yeah, it's only going to need like two minutes, really.
[79.46 --> 80.28]  Revelation song?
[80.76 --> 82.42]  Okay, I'll see where we go.
[90.00 --> 91.00]  Amen.
[120.00 --> 122.00]  Amen.

[334.12 --> 337.90]  As we sing holy, holy, holy
[340.22 --> 350.88]  Open the eyes of my heart, Lord
[350.88 --> 354.28]  Open the eyes of my heart
[354.28 --> 357.48]  I want to see you

[395.08 --> 399.16]  I lift it up
[399.16 --> 403.96]  Shining in the light of your glory
[403.96 --> 407.24]  Pour out your power and love
[407.24 --> 411.50]  As we sing holy, holy, holy
[411.50 --> 415.94]  Holy, holy, holy
[415.94 --> 419.36]  Holy, holy, holy

[472.36 --> 475.48]  As we sing holy, holy, holy
[475.48 --> 477.48]  Holy, holy, holy
[477.48 --> 480.52]  High and lifted up
[480.52 --> 484.64]  Oh, shining in the light of your glory
[484.64 --> 488.64]  Pour out your power and love
[488.64 --> 492.60]  As we sing holy, holy, holy

[504.80 --> 505.34]  Holy, holy, holy
[505.34 --> 506.74]  Holy, holy, holy
[506.74 --> 508.82]  I want to see you
[508.88 --> 513.12]  Holy, holy, holy
[513.18 --> 515.54]  Holy, holy, holy

[519.40 --> 519.70]  Holy, holy, holy
[519.70 --> 521.22]  Holy, holy, holy
[521.22 --> 525.92]  I won't see you
[525.92 --> 529.30]  We say, holy, holy, holy
[529.30 --> 533.38]  Holy, holy, holy
[533.38 --> 537.44]  Holy, holy, holy
[537.44 --> 539.92]  I won't see you
[539.92 --> 543.92]  I won't see you
[551.22 --> 581.20]  I won't see you
[581.20 --> 582.24]  Everyone got really quiet, eh?
[586.70 --> 589.08]  Good morning. How we doing?
[590.64 --> 597.04]  I want to welcome you to church this morning. A special welcome if you are visiting here with us.
[597.44 --> 605.34]  My name is Chris. I'm one of the pastors here and it's my privilege, along with these others, to lead us in worship this morning.
[605.34 --> 609.70]  As you can see, later in our service, we're going to celebrate Lord's Supper together.
[609.70 --> 618.80]  And so you can already now begin preparing your heart and soul to receive this meal from Jesus as we worship together.
[618.80 --> 624.92]  You may look around and realize that our average age is slightly higher than normal.
[624.92 --> 631.92]  And that's because this weekend was reactivate or is reactivate being hosted at Willoughby on the other side of town.
[631.92 --> 637.34]  So a bunch of our teenagers and youth leaders are over there this morning.
[637.42 --> 638.46]  They've had an excellent weekend.
[639.46 --> 650.26]  And Kevin will do this next week, but I just want to do it now and say thank you to all of you who volunteered and who made that happen and who came together to make that event the success that it was.
[650.26 --> 659.86]  And it is great to see that I had the opportunity to be there yesterday morning and to teach a learned event and to see some faces from here helping and volunteering.
[660.04 --> 664.62]  And then I went again last night with my daughter to worship and to see some more faces there.
[664.84 --> 667.90]  It was a great pleasure for us to all be part of that.
[669.10 --> 672.88]  There are a couple of announcements we want to also share with you this morning.
[672.88 --> 685.78]  The first is that Children's Worship Time, which is our worship ministry for kids running from preschool all the way to grade four, returns to its normal schedule.
[685.98 --> 689.88]  So that includes the grade ones through grade fours on October 1st.
[690.82 --> 695.58]  And so for the rest of September, we have the condensed schedule.
[695.58 --> 701.66]  And so there are clipboards at the back for the younger kids among us who want to participate in worship that way.
[701.66 --> 707.98]  But to return on October 1st and to do that well, we need people to sign up to teach and to volunteer there.
[708.08 --> 709.56]  And so there's a sign-up sheet at the back.
[710.20 --> 711.94]  Amy can answer any questions you have.
[712.02 --> 713.06]  Amy, just raise your hand real quick.
[713.12 --> 713.46]  There you go.
[713.54 --> 714.00]  That's Amy.
[714.20 --> 715.04]  She'll help you.
[715.56 --> 720.78]  If she's not at that table afterwards, the sign-up sheet is there and you can sign up at the back.
[721.88 --> 729.08]  Also wanted to let you know that choir practice begins tomorrow here at church.
[729.24 --> 730.54]  It will be in the multi-purpose room.
[730.54 --> 732.60]  You can be here at 645.
[733.16 --> 736.42]  And if you have questions, you can talk to Mark DeGeis about that.
[737.56 --> 742.84]  And then also on Tuesday night at 730, Council of this church.
[742.92 --> 744.46]  It's our governing board.
[744.72 --> 747.12]  They're going to have a meeting as well.
[747.24 --> 751.86]  And so you can pray for that this week in your prayers also.
[754.42 --> 754.84]  There.
[754.96 --> 755.38]  We have one more.
[755.68 --> 757.88]  If you were visiting with us, we would love to connect with you.
[758.18 --> 759.04]  We would love to hear from you.
[759.04 --> 760.58]  These cards are available at the back.
[760.68 --> 762.50]  There's also a QR code that you can scan.
[763.20 --> 767.68]  It gives us the opportunity to connect with you and pray with you and hear what you might
[767.68 --> 771.46]  need from us or how we can be together intentionally.
[773.06 --> 774.38]  I think that's all I have.
[774.38 --> 775.68]  So I'm going to ask you to stand.
[776.72 --> 779.54]  And we are going to be welcomed into worship.
[779.72 --> 781.00]  We're going to be greeted by God.
[781.08 --> 785.36]  But before we do that, I want to give you a chance just to those people around you to
[785.36 --> 786.92]  greet them and to welcome them.
[787.36 --> 788.06]  And now be mindful.
[788.22 --> 789.80]  Maybe not everyone wants to shake hands.
[789.88 --> 791.04]  And so maybe they want to fist bump.
[791.08 --> 792.34]  Or maybe they don't want to hug.
[792.40 --> 794.78]  And so you can nod your head politely to them.
[795.12 --> 796.48]  But just turn to your neighbors.
[796.74 --> 797.66]  Welcome them to worship.
[797.86 --> 799.46]  Greet them in the name of Jesus.
[799.46 --> 805.12]  Or even if you want to do the really old liturgical practice, say the peace of Christ be with you.
[806.92 --> 807.58]  Like this.
[808.02 --> 809.34]  Peace of Christ be with you.
[810.42 --> 811.76]  Peace of Christ be with you.
[812.82 --> 813.74]  Peace of Christ be with you.
[813.74 --> 814.34]  Peace of Christ be with you.
[829.46 --> 830.98]  All right.
[831.20 --> 837.66]  As we gather together, we do so as the family of God to worship him.
[837.80 --> 841.50]  And God welcomes us into this place.
[841.68 --> 843.00]  Into his presence.
[843.22 --> 847.64]  And so with hearts open, receive the greeting of God.
[848.62 --> 852.02]  Grace, mercy, and peace to you.
[852.02 --> 854.52]  From God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
[854.88 --> 857.46]  Through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[858.60 --> 858.96]  Amen.
[859.46 --> 860.34]  Let's worship God.
[864.60 --> 868.52]  Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty.
[869.38 --> 872.82]  Who was and is and is to come.
[873.94 --> 879.66]  You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power.
[879.66 --> 882.88]  For you created all things.
[883.72 --> 887.62]  And by your will, they were created and have their being.
[887.62 --> 891.46]  Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
[891.46 --> 900.10]  To receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and praise.
[900.10 --> 904.98]  To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb.
[904.98 --> 911.46]  Be praise and honor and glory and power forever and ever.
[911.46 --> 926.30]  Amen.

[1675.26 --> 1679.80]  Please pray with me with the words from Psalm 69.
[1681.64 --> 1685.96]  Save me, O God, for the waters have come up to my neck.
[1686.62 --> 1689.98]  I sink in the miry depths where there is no foothold.
[1690.70 --> 1694.40]  I have come into the deep waters, the floods engulf me.
[1695.18 --> 1697.38]  I am worn out, calling for help.
[1698.06 --> 1699.42]  My throat is parched.
[1700.06 --> 1702.50]  My eyes fail, looking for my God.
[1702.50 --> 1705.16]  You, God, know my folly.
[1705.90 --> 1707.82]  My guilt is not hidden from you.
[1709.04 --> 1714.82]  Lord, the Lord Almighty, may those who hope in you not be disgraced because of me.
[1715.54 --> 1720.76]  God of Israel, may those who seek you not be put to shame because of me.
[1721.70 --> 1727.48]  But I pray to you, Lord, in the time of your favor, in your great love, O God,
[1728.38 --> 1730.66]  answer me with your sure salvation.
[1730.66 --> 1732.08]  Amen.
[1732.50 --> 1736.32]  Amen.
[1736.32 --> 1757.20]  Unmoving and broken within
[1757.20 --> 1762.00]  Overwhelmed by the weight of your sin
[1762.00 --> 1764.62]  Jesus is calling
[1764.62 --> 1771.68]  Have you come to the end of yourself?
[1772.44 --> 1776.28]  Do you thirst for a drink from the well?
[1776.72 --> 1778.88]  Jesus is calling
[1778.88 --> 1786.98]  O come to the altar
[1786.98 --> 1791.54]  The Father's arms are open
[1791.54 --> 1796.76]  Why forgiveness was bought with
[1796.76 --> 1803.24]  The precious blood of Jesus Christ
[1803.24 --> 1815.24]  Leave behind your regrets and mistakes
[1815.24 --> 1820.22]  Come today, there's no reason to wait
[1820.22 --> 1822.68]  Jesus is calling
[1822.68 --> 1829.74]  Bring your sorrows and trade them for joy
[1829.74 --> 1834.02]  From the ashes a new life is born
[1834.02 --> 1836.54]  Jesus is calling
[1836.54 --> 1842.60]  Oh come to the altar
[1842.60 --> 1847.90]  The Father's arms are open wide
[1847.90 --> 1852.40]  Forgiveness was bought with
[1852.40 --> 1857.06]  The precious blood of Jesus Christ
[1857.06 --> 1861.28]  Oh come to the altar
[1861.28 --> 1866.16]  The Father's arms are open wide
[1866.16 --> 1870.66]  Forgiveness was bought with
[1870.66 --> 1876.06]  The precious blood of Jesus Christ
[1876.06 --> 1889.60]  Oh what a Savior
[1889.60 --> 1895.20]  Isn't he wonderful
[1895.20 --> 1898.64]  Sing hallelujah
[1898.64 --> 1901.70]  Christ is risen
[1901.70 --> 1909.20]  Bow down before him
[1909.20 --> 1913.66]  For he is Lord of all
[1913.66 --> 1916.48]  Sing hallelujah
[1916.48 --> 1919.70]  Christ is risen
[1919.70 --> 1925.36]  Oh what a Savior
[1925.36 --> 1925.42]  Oh what a Savior
[1925.42 --> 1926.92]  Isn't he wonderful
[1926.92 --> 1927.92]  Oh what a Savior
[1927.92 --> 1930.92]  Isn't he wonderful
[1930.92 --> 1933.92]  Sing hallelujah
[1933.92 --> 1937.92]  Christ is risen
[1937.92 --> 1951.92]  Oh come to the altar
[1951.92 --> 1967.90]  The Father's arms are open wide
[1967.90 --> 1973.90]  Forgiveness was bought with
[1973.90 --> 1978.54]  The precious blood of Jesus Christ
[1978.54 --> 1982.46]  Oh come to the altar
[1982.46 --> 1987.78]  The Father's arms are open wide
[1987.78 --> 1992.28]  Forgiveness was bought with
[1992.28 --> 1997.88]  The precious blood of Jesus Christ
[1997.88 --> 2011.88]  Bear your cross as you wait for the crown
[2011.88 --> 2017.88]  Tell the world of the treasure you found
[2017.88 --> 2032.94]  Our words of assurance today come from Hebrews 10
[2032.94 --> 2036.26]  Therefore brothers and sisters
[2036.26 --> 2042.12]  Since we have confidence to enter the most holy place by the blood of Jesus
[2042.12 --> 2048.12]  By a new and living way opened for us through the curtain that is his body
[2048.12 --> 2053.70]  And since we have a great priest over the house of God
[2053.70 --> 2057.84]  Let us draw near to God with a sincere heart
[2057.84 --> 2060.84]  And with the full assurance that faith brings
[2060.84 --> 2067.32]  Having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience
[2067.32 --> 2071.64]  And having our bodies washed with pure water
[2071.64 --> 2076.40]  Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess
[2076.40 --> 2079.56]  For he who promised is faithful
[2079.56 --> 2086.48]  And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds
[2086.48 --> 2091.82]  Not giving up meeting together as some are in the habit of doing
[2091.82 --> 2094.30]  But encouraging one another
[2094.30 --> 2098.12]  And all the more as you see the day approaching
[2098.12 --> 2120.52]  I cast my mind to Calvary
[2120.52 --> 2128.52]  Where Jesus bled and died for me
[2128.52 --> 2136.40]  I see his wounds, his hands, his feet
[2136.40 --> 2143.52]  My Savior on that cursed tree
[2143.52 --> 2154.70]  His body bowed and drenched in tears
[2154.70 --> 2161.52]  They laid him down in Joseph's tomb
[2161.52 --> 2168.52]  The entrance sealed by heavy stone
[2168.52 --> 2172.52]  Messiah still
[2172.52 --> 2176.52]  And all alone
[2176.52 --> 2184.56]  Oh praise the name
[2184.56 --> 2188.44]  Of the Lord our God
[2188.44 --> 2191.52]  Oh praise his name
[2191.52 --> 2194.52]  Forevermore
[2194.52 --> 2198.52]  For endless days
[2198.52 --> 2202.52]  We will sing your praise
[2202.52 --> 2204.52]  Oh Lord
[2204.52 --> 2208.52]  Oh Lord our God
[2208.52 --> 2214.52]  Then on the third
[2214.52 --> 2218.52]  At break of dawn
[2218.52 --> 2220.52]  The Son of Heaven
[2220.52 --> 2224.52]  The Son of Heaven
[2224.52 --> 2225.52]  Rose again
[2225.52 --> 2226.52]  Oh trampled death
[2226.52 --> 2229.52]  O trampled death
[2229.52 --> 2234.52]  Where is your sting
[2234.52 --> 2236.52]  The angels roar
[2236.52 --> 2240.52]  For Christ the King
[2240.52 --> 2253.06]  O praise the name of the Lord our God
[2253.06 --> 2260.20]  O praise His name forevermore
[2260.20 --> 2267.20]  For endless days we will sing Your praise
[2267.20 --> 2274.54]  O Lord, O Lord our God
[2274.54 --> 2284.88]  You shall return in robes of white
[2284.88 --> 2292.48]  The blazing sun shall pierce the night
[2292.48 --> 2299.82]  And I will rise among the saints
[2299.82 --> 2307.82]  My face transfixed on Jesus' face
[2307.82 --> 2315.16]  guitar solo
[2315.16 --> 2322.50]  O praise the name of the Lord our God
[2322.50 --> 2337.84]  O praise the name of the Lord our God
[2337.84 --> 2341.84]  O praise His name forevermore
[2341.84 --> 2349.18]  For endless days we will sing Your praise
[2349.18 --> 2357.18]  O Lord, O Lord our God
[2357.18 --> 2361.18]  O praise the name of the Lord our God
[2361.18 --> 2367.52]  O Lord, O Lord our God
[2367.52 --> 2374.52]  O praise the name of the Lord our God
[2374.52 --> 2381.52]  O praise His name forevermore
[2381.52 --> 2387.86]  For endless days we will sing Your praise
[2387.86 --> 2393.86]  O Lord, O Lord our God
[2393.86 --> 2403.86]  O Lord, O Lord our God
[2403.86 --> 2433.84]  O Lord our God
[2433.84 --> 2435.84]  commission today is for the budget
[2435.84 --> 2438.64]  for all the work that's done in our church
[2438.64 --> 2442.56]  The second is for commission to every nation
[2442.56 --> 2446.66]  It is a servant organization which helps
[2446.66 --> 2450.18]  missionaries like Jody and Yurel Gonzalez
[2450.18 --> 2453.82]  fulfill the unique vision God has given them
[2453.82 --> 2456.14]  through administrative support
[2456.14 --> 2459.14]  they provide accountability and help
[2459.16 --> 2461.80]  the missionary get to the field
[2462.56 --> 2467.94]  Through pastoral care, they help them remain effective and healthy while there.
[2469.52 --> 2471.16]  Jody sends a message.
[2472.06 --> 2476.70]  This year marks 10 years of ministry in Mexico for me, Jody.
[2477.44 --> 2482.84]  So much has happened, so much has changed, but one thing remains the same,
[2482.84 --> 2486.28]  and that is God and his faithfulness to us.
[2486.28 --> 2492.68]  After a summer of cooking for teams at the Connections house and family visiting,
[2493.20 --> 2497.40]  we are now ready to start the fall school routine.
[2498.56 --> 2503.00]  Jonathan is being homeschooled one more year and is in grade 3.
[2503.82 --> 2510.56]  Anthony is still doing some grade 1 catch-up work, but is well on his way to grade 2.
[2510.56 --> 2520.74]  We are praying that the full year of one-on-one with his tutor will get him ready for classroom setting next year.
[2521.40 --> 2528.88]  Both boys are bilingual and not afraid to jump in and help translate when needed.
[2529.44 --> 2535.92]  We currently have 16 men in our third-phase recovery home, El Faro.
[2535.92 --> 2545.92]  This ministry is hard as we watch some of our men go back to drugs and alcohol after being clean for months.
[2546.32 --> 2547.00]  It hurts.
[2547.86 --> 2550.92]  But then you meet El Milo.
[2551.40 --> 2556.20]  He is deported and lost on the streets in Tijuana.
[2556.64 --> 2559.26]  His family had no hope for him.
[2559.26 --> 2566.54]  El Milo found his way to our home and has worked hard for the past year and a half.
[2567.06 --> 2568.68]  He is clean and sober.
[2569.36 --> 2571.22]  He's reunited with his family.
[2572.28 --> 2577.24]  He's working full-time and has become Uriel's partner in ministry.
[2577.98 --> 2582.06]  El Milo's dad stays with us one weekend every month.
[2582.70 --> 2584.92]  Can't believe he has his son back.
[2585.38 --> 2587.72]  This is why we do what we do.
[2587.72 --> 2592.88]  Langley Emanuel family, thank you, capital letters.
[2593.44 --> 2601.56]  Your prayers and financial support are very much needed and appreciated as we do the work God has called us to do.
[2602.38 --> 2606.54]  Next week's special collection is for Cascade Family Counseling.
[2606.54 --> 2608.54]  Thank you.
[2609.26 --> 2610.26]  Thank you.
[2610.26 --> 2612.26]  Thank you.
[2612.26 --> 2615.98]  Thank you.
[2615.98 --> 2617.98]  Thank you.
[2617.98 --> 2621.70]  Thank you.
[2621.70 --> 2623.70]  Thank you.
[2623.70 --> 2627.42]  Thank you.
[2627.42 --> 2629.42]  Thank you.
[2629.42 --> 2633.14]  Thank you.
[2633.14 --> 2635.14]  Thank you.
[2635.14 --> 2637.14]  Thank you.
[2637.14 --> 2639.14]  Thank you.
[2639.14 --> 2646.86]  Thank you.
[2646.86 --> 2648.86]  Thank you.
[2648.86 --> 2650.86]  Thank you.
[2650.86 --> 2652.86]  Thank you.
[2652.86 --> 2666.58]  Thank you.
[2666.58 --> 2678.30]  Thank you.
[2678.30 --> 2684.30]  Thank you.
[2684.30 --> 2702.02]  Thank you.
[2702.02 --> 2719.74]  Thank you.
[2719.74 --> 2737.46]  Thank you.
[2737.46 --> 2739.46]  Thank you.
[2739.46 --> 2757.18]  Thank you.
[2757.18 --> 2759.18]  Thank you.
[2759.18 --> 2776.90]  Thank you.
[2776.90 --> 2778.90]  Thank you.
[2778.90 --> 2796.62]  Thank you.
[2796.62 --> 2797.62]  All right.
[2797.62 --> 2798.62]  All right.
[2798.62 --> 2808.74]  We're going to ask the preschool and kindergarten aged kids to come on up or all the kids can come on up and receive the blessing.
[2808.74 --> 2816.62]  But those who are aged three to five are going to head out to a worship time down the way.
[2816.62 --> 2817.78]  Excellent.
[2817.78 --> 2821.38]  Come on up.
[2821.44 --> 2822.12]  You want to sit there?
[2822.62 --> 2822.94]  Do it.
[2823.06 --> 2823.94]  You can ask all the questions.
[2823.94 --> 2828.44]  So who went to school this week?
[2830.72 --> 2833.10]  One, two, four.
[2834.32 --> 2835.04]  Was it fun?
[2835.92 --> 2836.88]  Did you love it?
[2837.80 --> 2839.20]  Are you excited the weekend came?
[2840.78 --> 2841.22]  No.
[2843.66 --> 2844.64]  You didn't go to school?
[2844.70 --> 2845.16]  I think you did.
[2845.22 --> 2848.36]  I'm pretty sure I saw a picture of you actually at school this week.
[2848.46 --> 2849.18]  Checking it out.
[2850.24 --> 2850.90]  Very cool.
[2850.98 --> 2851.14]  Okay.
[2851.14 --> 2856.52]  So you guys are going to go to church school and you're going to learn at the back about Jesus.
[2856.68 --> 2858.08]  And some of you might stay here.
[2858.40 --> 2861.90]  But before you do that, we're going to pray and we're going to say a blessing with you.
[2861.94 --> 2862.38]  Is that cool?
[2863.60 --> 2864.06]  All right.
[2864.12 --> 2867.04]  Let's fold our hands and pray together.
[2868.64 --> 2873.46]  Dear Jesus, we pray for the hearts and minds of these little ones here.
[2873.46 --> 2877.88]  May they too see you in worship.
[2878.92 --> 2883.20]  May they too know your love and know that they are loved.
[2883.94 --> 2889.36]  Be with their teachers and leaders and help them to speak the truth of your gospel.
[2890.02 --> 2891.18]  In Jesus' name we pray.
[2891.86 --> 2892.16]  Amen.
[2892.16 --> 2893.54]  All right.
[2893.60 --> 2894.54]  I'm going to ask you guys to stand up.
[2895.94 --> 2897.22]  And you know how this works, right?
[2897.28 --> 2898.58]  We turn around and we face everyone.
[2898.88 --> 2901.84]  We hold our hands up and then we're going to say the Lord be with you.
[2901.92 --> 2905.18]  And then they're going to respond in the same way.
[2905.26 --> 2905.46]  Ready?
[2906.24 --> 2907.92]  The Lord be with you.
[2908.64 --> 2909.86]  And also with you.
[2910.22 --> 2910.54]  Amen.
[2910.54 --> 2910.64]  Amen.
[2922.16 --> 2932.26]  Good morning.
[2932.78 --> 2933.68]  My name is Daryl.
[2933.76 --> 2935.02]  I'm one of the elders here at Emanuel.
[2935.78 --> 2937.74]  Let's go to God in our church family prayer.
[2941.86 --> 2946.14]  Father in heaven, we are thankful to gather here together this morning to worship you.
[2946.82 --> 2949.38]  We thank you for a summer with many days of sunshine.
[2949.38 --> 2956.56]  As summer ends and fall begins, we look forward to the many ministries starting back up after the summer break.
[2957.02 --> 2963.48]  We pray for coffee break, cadets, gems, youth, young adults, seniors, care groups, and other ministries.
[2963.86 --> 2971.10]  We pray that leaders and volunteers will feel a clear calling and desire to serve and use the gifts you have given them.
[2972.56 --> 2977.74]  Please also be with the elders, deacons, and pastoral care workers as they continue after the summer.
[2977.74 --> 2982.68]  We continue to pray for all the students and teachers as they transition back to school.
[2983.36 --> 2987.80]  May you bless them in their efforts and help them to continue to grow in their knowledge and faith.
[2988.66 --> 2993.28]  Please be with Rika Emmons as she mourns the loss of her mother and bless her time in the Netherlands.
[2994.22 --> 2999.28]  Please also continue to be with the Riesbos family and friends as they grieve the loss of Louise.
[3000.02 --> 3003.12]  Many others, Lord, continue to grieve lost loved ones.
[3003.12 --> 3005.76]  And we pray you surround them with your love and comfort.
[3006.96 --> 3013.00]  May you be strengthened with all power according to his glorious might for all endurance and patience with joy.
[3014.24 --> 3019.34]  Please be with the youth at the Reactivate event as they wrap up their time together this morning.
[3019.84 --> 3025.06]  We pray that it was a blessing to the youth and leaders and that the lessons learned will remain with them.
[3025.06 --> 3028.74]  Thank you for the missionaries that are spreading your word throughout the world.
[3029.50 --> 3035.62]  We pray for those connected to our church, such as Jody and Ariel in Mexico, Tim and Charity and Sam and Arm,
[3035.88 --> 3039.10]  and Jared as he does his discipleship training in Costa Rica.
[3039.54 --> 3040.86]  Please continue to bless them.
[3041.76 --> 3046.84]  As the world continues to deal with the aftermath and ongoing effects of the pandemic and war in Ukraine,
[3047.58 --> 3049.86]  please help us to trust that you are in control.
[3049.86 --> 3054.26]  As we hear your word this morning, may you give us ears to hear.
[3054.88 --> 3058.08]  Be with Pastor Chris as he delivers your message of hope and love.
[3058.80 --> 3061.38]  Let us not only hear, but also be your hands and feet.
[3062.26 --> 3065.06]  May your spirit give us power to show your love to one another.
[3065.82 --> 3067.94]  We pray all these things in Jesus' glorious name.
[3068.70 --> 3068.92]  Amen.
[3068.92 --> 3069.04]  Amen.
[3073.64 --> 3074.36]  Thanks, Daryl.
[3079.86 --> 3094.34]  In just a moment, we're going to read together in the scriptures from Matthew 18.
[3095.22 --> 3097.88]  We're going to read at verse 15 through 20.
[3098.08 --> 3102.38]  If you have a Bible with you, of course, I encourage you to open that up and to have that.
[3102.38 --> 3107.62]  And then even when I finish reading, leave that open on your lap or on the chair beside you,
[3107.62 --> 3112.34]  if there's room for that, because we're going to refer back pretty regularly throughout.
[3112.66 --> 3116.40]  If you don't have a Bible and would like one, there are a few on the back wall there.
[3116.48 --> 3117.44]  You can grab one there.
[3119.42 --> 3121.32]  If you go quickly, you can get one.
[3121.92 --> 3124.30]  Otherwise, you're going to have to have remembered your own.
[3124.30 --> 3136.78]  A few weeks ago, or a week and a half ago, we hosted here a ministry town hall
[3136.78 --> 3143.24]  to discuss the young adult ministry among us and the hoped-for plan from council
[3143.24 --> 3146.46]  for a ministry position to coordinate that work.
[3146.46 --> 3151.90]  As part of that evening, and if I'm honest, what I think was the best part,
[3152.80 --> 3155.44]  we heard from a number of young adults.
[3156.34 --> 3158.98]  Now, for those of you who are unfamiliar with that phrase,
[3159.10 --> 3166.38]  a young adult is somebody sort of post-high school and then sort of in their early to mid-30s.
[3167.26 --> 3170.30]  A young adult is pretty easy to start in its definition.
[3170.56 --> 3172.60]  It's less easy to figure out when that ends.
[3172.60 --> 3179.94]  But we heard stories from people in our church family who are young adults.
[3182.00 --> 3186.92]  And as part of that sharing, we ask the question,
[3187.74 --> 3188.84]  why are you here?
[3190.40 --> 3191.90]  Why do you keep coming here?
[3192.56 --> 3194.10]  And why do you stay?
[3195.36 --> 3199.66]  Now, this morning, I want to expand on that question for us
[3199.66 --> 3202.10]  and to do that for all of us, right?
[3202.10 --> 3203.78]  Why are you here?
[3204.92 --> 3210.26]  Both here in the sense of Emmanuel, right, at this particular church.
[3210.30 --> 3212.40]  Why do you call this your church family?
[3212.50 --> 3217.22]  But also here in the sense of the immediate present, the right now.
[3217.28 --> 3218.50]  Why are you here right now?
[3219.44 --> 3220.28]  Why do we gather?
[3220.28 --> 3229.12]  As we start together a new ministry and mission year, it's worth asking that question.
[3230.20 --> 3231.40]  Why are you here?
[3231.86 --> 3232.86]  Why do we gather?
[3233.00 --> 3233.90]  What's the point?
[3234.30 --> 3237.32]  What is the hoped-for outcome in all of this?
[3237.36 --> 3239.62]  What is the goal of all of this together?
[3239.62 --> 3247.04]  Now, as we dive into this conversation, I want to be clear because I really believe that when asking this question,
[3247.62 --> 3251.90]  posture, right, heart posture matters.
[3251.90 --> 3262.20]  And when I was a teenager, on Sundays, I would wake up maybe with enough time to get to church,
[3262.20 --> 3263.52]  and I would always whine,
[3263.92 --> 3265.58]  why do I have to go to church?
[3265.58 --> 3268.46]  I don't get anything out of it anyways.
[3268.92 --> 3269.74]  What's the point?
[3271.14 --> 3276.10]  Now, as I got a little older, I have learned the impact that us three boys,
[3276.48 --> 3279.60]  being that way every Sunday morning, had on my mom in particular.
[3280.04 --> 3284.32]  She was trying to get ready for worship, and for that I have apologized and continue to apologize.
[3284.88 --> 3286.88]  Mom, you just waved, so we're good.
[3286.88 --> 3295.60]  But maybe, whether you're a teenager or you're a parent of teenagers, or even if you're not,
[3295.98 --> 3298.58]  maybe that's how you ask the question.
[3299.16 --> 3299.80]  What's the point?
[3301.22 --> 3305.34]  And like I said, I think it's a worthwhile question,
[3306.02 --> 3308.54]  and I really do want you to ask it, right?
[3308.98 --> 3313.08]  You've heard me say this before, but no question is off limits here
[3313.08 --> 3316.14]  if you're genuinely asking it.
[3317.88 --> 3320.34]  Because what I know when I asked that question as a kid,
[3320.48 --> 3321.24]  what's the point?
[3321.42 --> 3322.80]  I didn't really want an answer.
[3323.16 --> 3326.24]  I was using it as a justification for my own apathy.
[3328.34 --> 3330.78]  Instead, and here's why I said posture matters,
[3331.80 --> 3334.28]  instead, let's really ask the question.
[3335.08 --> 3337.26]  Why do we gather?
[3338.56 --> 3342.68]  Now, there are all sorts of ways that you can answer this question from the Bible.
[3342.82 --> 3346.78]  There are all sorts of places that we could go in the Bible to answer this question.
[3346.88 --> 3351.38]  And in particular, if you're part of the worship ministries of this church,
[3351.38 --> 3353.74]  you've heard me talk about this a bunch of times.
[3354.98 --> 3358.22]  And so this morning, I want to go to a different place.
[3358.98 --> 3364.50]  Now, at first blush, this might seem like a strange place to go in asking this question,
[3364.50 --> 3371.26]  but I think that there is something particularly important for our particular gathering,
[3371.88 --> 3379.02]  especially as we try to do so in this 21st century, increasingly post-Christian world that we find ourselves.
[3379.96 --> 3383.20]  And so to do that, we're going to read from Matthew 18.
[3384.20 --> 3387.08]  We're going to read verse 15 to 20.
[3387.08 --> 3391.58]  Hear the words of Jesus.
[3391.58 --> 3399.74]  If your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault, just between the two of you.
[3400.92 --> 3403.54]  If they listen to you, you have won them over.
[3404.46 --> 3407.34]  But if they will not listen, take one or two others along,
[3407.50 --> 3411.60]  so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
[3411.60 --> 3415.86]  If they still refuse to listen, tell it to the church.
[3416.18 --> 3421.30]  And if they refuse to listen even to the church, treat them as you would a pagan or tax collector.
[3422.94 --> 3427.22]  Truly, I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven,
[3427.34 --> 3430.52]  and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
[3431.98 --> 3438.22]  Again, truly, I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything they ask for,
[3438.22 --> 3441.56]  it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.
[3441.56 --> 3448.14]  For where two or three gather in my name, there I am with them.
[3449.26 --> 3450.56]  This is the word of the Lord.
[3454.64 --> 3458.72]  Now, in this text, like I said, these aren't the only reasons,
[3458.98 --> 3460.50]  but the ones we're going to focus on today.
[3460.64 --> 3465.40]  In this text, I see for us four reasons why we gather.
[3466.26 --> 3467.64]  And this will be our outline.
[3468.88 --> 3473.26]  And as we go through, don't worry, each one gets progressively shorter in content.
[3475.10 --> 3477.26]  First, accountability.
[3478.88 --> 3481.24]  The second reason from this text that we're going to see is discipline.
[3482.20 --> 3486.04]  The third reason that we're going to see from this text is sacralizing.
[3486.34 --> 3488.84]  Now, I know that that's a weird word and probably not one you're familiar with.
[3488.90 --> 3490.58]  I will explain what that means when we get there.
[3490.58 --> 3495.06]  And then the fourth reason where we will end is presence.
[3495.62 --> 3500.50]  So, accountability, discipline, sacralizing, and presence.
[3500.50 --> 3502.54]  And so, let's start with accountability.
[3504.26 --> 3506.20]  Verse 15 says,
[3507.30 --> 3512.06]  If your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault.
[3512.06 --> 3516.08]  Now, first of all, notice Jesus is addressing.
[3516.32 --> 3516.60]  It says,
[3516.72 --> 3519.28]  If your brother or sister sins.
[3520.02 --> 3526.68]  First, Jesus redefines relationship and changes who your family is.
[3526.68 --> 3531.86]  In Matthew 12, if you flip over just a couple pages.
[3532.98 --> 3539.18]  In Matthew 12, at verse 48, Jesus says,
[3540.18 --> 3543.44]  Who is my mother and who are my brothers?
[3544.16 --> 3545.92]  And pointing to his disciples, he said,
[3545.92 --> 3548.10]  Here are my mother and my brothers.
[3548.10 --> 3554.60]  For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and my sister and my mother.
[3556.70 --> 3562.12]  To be a believing disciple of Jesus is to gain a new family.
[3563.56 --> 3569.20]  Listen to Paul, the Apostle Paul, in Ephesians 2, verse 19.
[3570.10 --> 3570.60]  He says,
[3570.60 --> 3589.38]  The word that's originally written in Greek there, the word meaning household, can also be translated family.
[3590.54 --> 3596.44]  In fact, some scholars even include in the range of meaning of that word, related by blood.
[3596.44 --> 3603.16]  And so for Christians, it is the blood of Jesus that makes us one family.
[3604.86 --> 3613.92]  Explaining this new spiritual reality, Paul says just before in chapter 1 of Ephesians, in verse 4 and 5, he says,
[3613.92 --> 3620.36]  For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight.
[3620.36 --> 3627.74]  In love he predestined us for adoption to sonship through Jesus Christ.
[3629.32 --> 3634.60]  We have all been adopted by God through Jesus and to each other.
[3635.58 --> 3637.72]  Adoption is the gospel.
[3638.26 --> 3639.90]  And let's be really clear about this, right?
[3639.98 --> 3642.82]  Not as less than another, right?
[3642.96 --> 3645.88]  After the adoption happens, it's over.
[3647.10 --> 3648.84]  He's not an adopted son.
[3648.84 --> 3650.30]  He is a son.
[3651.96 --> 3654.34]  You are not my adopted sister.
[3654.74 --> 3655.70]  You are my sister.
[3656.18 --> 3656.80]  Full stop.
[3657.98 --> 3667.42]  And as brothers and sisters, mothers and father, all of you, all of us, one to the other, we gather together.
[3668.38 --> 3670.06]  Families gather.
[3670.06 --> 3673.80]  And part of why we gather.
[3674.52 --> 3684.02]  Part of why we gather is because I, for one, and I suspect all of you, need help remembering who you are.
[3684.02 --> 3690.32]  I forget that I have been predestined in love for adoption to sonship.
[3690.48 --> 3696.78]  I forget that before the foundation of the world, I was chosen to be holy and blameless in his sight.
[3697.16 --> 3701.98]  And yes, surprising to all of you, except for maybe my wife, I sin.
[3704.48 --> 3705.44]  I sin.
[3705.44 --> 3707.80]  I am declared holy.
[3707.90 --> 3708.12]  Amen.
[3708.94 --> 3710.44]  I am born again blameless.
[3711.16 --> 3712.78]  Amen and amen.
[3713.12 --> 3717.08]  But there are times in my life when it doesn't look like that is true.
[3718.12 --> 3724.80]  And I need you, my gathered Jesus family, to point that out and to hold me accountable.
[3730.14 --> 3731.40]  We all need that.
[3732.90 --> 3733.14]  Right?
[3733.14 --> 3733.72]  Right?
[3735.44 --> 3735.84]  Right?
[3735.96 --> 3736.78]  That's a real question.
[3737.70 --> 3738.30]  Okay, thank you.
[3738.66 --> 3739.54]  Not the only one.
[3740.60 --> 3740.76]  Right?
[3740.78 --> 3744.70]  We may not always want it, but we all need it.
[3746.50 --> 3752.88]  And part of why we gather in worship, but also perhaps especially why we gather in small groups
[3752.88 --> 3757.90]  and in Bible studies and as mentors and mentees in different ministries like Coffee Break,
[3757.90 --> 3764.42]  which is primarily young women, but not only young women's ministry that takes place on Tuesday mornings
[3764.42 --> 3769.84]  here at church with coffee and Bible study, primarily why the seniors group gathers together.
[3771.10 --> 3771.20]  Right?
[3771.28 --> 3778.66]  Part of why we gather is because as a family in the household of God, we are called to be
[3778.66 --> 3785.26]  holy and blameless, even as we are already by grace through faith made holy and blameless.
[3785.26 --> 3792.62]  And for each of us to live that out well and to do so more and more ever increasingly comprehensively
[3792.62 --> 3796.02]  in every corner of our lives, we need each other's help.
[3796.76 --> 3798.18]  We need accountability.
[3800.10 --> 3802.54]  Because, and listen here, right?
[3802.54 --> 3811.26]  No one, no one is more winsome to you in justifying your own sin than you are.
[3813.02 --> 3814.12]  Follow what I mean there?
[3815.76 --> 3821.02]  We are all really, really good at justifying ourself.
[3821.54 --> 3825.64]  It's really easy to say, oh, no one's getting hurt.
[3826.72 --> 3827.90]  And it's only a little bit.
[3828.76 --> 3830.04]  It's only on the weekends.
[3830.04 --> 3832.42]  Sometimes, I deserve this.
[3833.94 --> 3834.06]  Right?
[3834.14 --> 3836.56]  Sometimes we are really good at saying, that's not greed.
[3836.90 --> 3838.28]  That's just business savvy.
[3839.84 --> 3841.20]  Or that's not pride.
[3841.72 --> 3842.98]  I'm just really competent.
[3844.68 --> 3845.16]  Right?
[3845.22 --> 3850.60]  Whatever it is, and you know how easy it is to justify yourself.
[3850.60 --> 3856.86]  And that's why we need someone who is not us to tell us and to point out our blind spots.
[3856.86 --> 3861.16]  Because we get blind to these things in our own hearts and to hold us accountable.
[3863.40 --> 3865.70]  But, please hear this.
[3866.24 --> 3868.20]  Because this is critically important for accountability.
[3869.44 --> 3876.46]  If you are going to call out someone's sin, which in case you haven't heard that yet, that's what we're talking about.
[3876.46 --> 3878.12]  That's what this text is telling us to do.
[3878.66 --> 3878.88]  Right?
[3878.88 --> 3884.36]  What is foundational to our purpose for gathering is calling out each other's sin.
[3884.54 --> 3891.26]  If you were going to call out the sin of a brother or sister, you better make sure that it's actually a sin.
[3892.18 --> 3892.62]  Right?
[3892.64 --> 3894.52]  And not something that you would just do differently.
[3895.94 --> 3896.38]  Right?
[3896.38 --> 3900.56]  Or not something that you would just choose otherwise if it was your choice.
[3902.06 --> 3902.52]  So hear me.
[3902.58 --> 3904.18]  We have to call sin a sin.
[3904.24 --> 3905.10]  And we cannot be afraid.
[3905.22 --> 3907.30]  We must call sin and sin.
[3907.58 --> 3914.24]  But we must do so being sure that we have scripture to back it up and to prove it.
[3914.24 --> 3919.12]  And so before you go holding anyone to account for their sin, check your own heart.
[3919.40 --> 3920.70]  And then check the word.
[3920.90 --> 3922.74]  And then pray for insight and clarity.
[3923.34 --> 3925.76]  And then do it all again.
[3926.22 --> 3927.28]  Check your own heart.
[3927.40 --> 3928.44]  And check the word.
[3928.58 --> 3930.02]  And then check in with the Holy Spirit.
[3930.02 --> 3940.42]  And then only then with gentleness and respect and with as much humility as you can muster, ask the hard questions.
[3940.64 --> 3942.88]  Or ask the heart questions.
[3944.24 --> 3946.42]  Remember the goal.
[3947.94 --> 3951.56]  If they listen to you, Jesus says, you have won them over.
[3953.06 --> 3962.52]  That is, if you are right and they know that you are right and repent, you have drawn them back to the household of God, to the family.
[3962.84 --> 3974.16]  The goal of accountability is to restore them to identity of adoption, to sonship, to being holy and blameless.
[3974.24 --> 3977.96]  And maybe this is a truism now, but I think it's also just true.
[3978.28 --> 3983.06]  That if we don't gather, we can't practice accountability.
[3984.00 --> 3986.94]  And if we're never with each other, you can never say what I need to hear.
[3988.04 --> 3989.46]  We need accountability.
[3989.82 --> 3992.28]  And so we need to gather.
[3992.28 --> 3996.42]  Sometimes accountability has to go a step further.
[3996.66 --> 3999.56]  And that's our second reason why we gather.
[4000.40 --> 4000.96]  Discipline.
[4000.96 --> 4014.90]  Now, I know that discipline is a hard word for many of us, especially when we talk about church discipline.
[4015.00 --> 4023.58]  And I'm very aware and have lived through and seen some awful instances of churches abusing power of discipline.
[4023.58 --> 4030.66]  And I know that because of that, there is a type of church person who is in the modern era who doesn't like the word discipline.
[4031.02 --> 4040.50]  And if I'm really candid with you this morning, there is a generation of, let's be bold and prophetic,
[4040.66 --> 4045.40]  there is a generation of boomer Christian leader or liberal Christian or progressive Christian
[4045.40 --> 4048.98]  who hides a cheap grace behind the phrase,
[4049.30 --> 4050.12]  Who am I to judge?
[4052.00 --> 4052.22]  Right?
[4052.28 --> 4053.68]  Or who hides behind the phrase,
[4053.78 --> 4055.34]  We've all been set free from the law.
[4055.78 --> 4057.86]  But listen to the words of Jesus here.
[4061.58 --> 4064.56]  But if they will not listen, Jesus says.
[4067.26 --> 4070.08]  But if they will not listen, take one or two others along,
[4070.22 --> 4073.62]  so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
[4073.62 --> 4076.92]  And if they still refuse to listen, tell it to the church.
[4077.24 --> 4079.42]  And if they refuse to listen even to the church,
[4079.56 --> 4082.66]  treat them as you would a pagan or tax collector.
[4084.02 --> 4090.74]  And so you see, the gospel is indeed about freedom from sin and death.
[4090.88 --> 4092.92]  And yes, even freedom from the law.
[4093.24 --> 4097.30]  But the gospel is also about freedom to holiness,
[4097.94 --> 4099.74]  to a disciplined life,
[4100.12 --> 4102.98]  freedom to not going on in sin.
[4102.98 --> 4103.64]  Right?
[4103.76 --> 4106.30]  Freedom from and freedom to.
[4107.30 --> 4109.70]  Now here's an interesting test case in this, right?
[4110.96 --> 4115.34]  It is demonstrably true, right,
[4115.40 --> 4118.92]  that church-going religious faith,
[4119.12 --> 4121.56]  not just Christian, but generally religious faith,
[4121.70 --> 4123.70]  is on the decline in Canada.
[4123.70 --> 4126.32]  After World War II,
[4127.08 --> 4131.74]  more than two-thirds of Canadians attended weekly religious services
[4131.74 --> 4134.78]  of whatever variety and type or religion they were part of.
[4134.84 --> 4136.52]  More than two-thirds of Canadians.
[4136.66 --> 4139.86]  In 1996, that was already down to one-third.
[4141.64 --> 4144.30]  And in 2019, the number for which we,
[4144.42 --> 4146.56]  the most recent number for which we have actual data on this,
[4146.94 --> 4148.62]  that's down to 11%.
[4148.62 --> 4153.04]  And now, perhaps after COVID, right,
[4153.08 --> 4154.02]  that number is even lower.
[4154.02 --> 4157.70]  The trend of decline is pretty steeply downward.
[4158.98 --> 4161.76]  And in the CRC, the Christian Reformed Church,
[4162.04 --> 4165.40]  we are lagging a little bit behind that general trend,
[4165.56 --> 4166.60]  but it is also downwards.
[4166.60 --> 4171.50]  But, fascinating to me,
[4171.98 --> 4174.78]  there are pockets within our society,
[4175.20 --> 4176.62]  pockets of religious communities,
[4177.00 --> 4179.82]  that are experiencing growth.
[4180.64 --> 4182.92]  And not just immigration growth,
[4183.16 --> 4185.54]  because that's a place where religion often tends to grow.
[4186.24 --> 4186.78]  For instance,
[4187.72 --> 4192.56]  old-school, traditional Roman Catholicism.
[4192.56 --> 4193.12]  Right?
[4193.94 --> 4195.32]  This is like pre-Vatican II,
[4195.64 --> 4197.34]  Latin-only Roman Catholicism,
[4197.38 --> 4199.84]  is experiencing growth right now.
[4200.72 --> 4202.82]  The Greek Orthodox Church,
[4203.48 --> 4207.82]  right, which boasts on not having changed their liturgy for 2,000 years,
[4208.52 --> 4209.56]  is growing right now.
[4210.76 --> 4214.12]  There's even a smaller segment of super conservative,
[4214.54 --> 4218.08]  small and specific Presbyterian and Reformed churches
[4218.08 --> 4220.10]  that are experiencing growth right now.
[4220.10 --> 4222.34]  And do you know where this growth is primarily happening?
[4223.52 --> 4224.88]  Among young people.
[4227.22 --> 4228.52]  Especially young men.
[4229.82 --> 4230.96]  Why is that?
[4232.98 --> 4239.64]  I suggest that when people inherit a faith,
[4239.72 --> 4242.54]  or experience a faith from their parents,
[4242.74 --> 4243.56]  or from their community,
[4243.84 --> 4245.96]  that has no requirements on them,
[4246.92 --> 4249.22]  that doesn't demand something from them,
[4249.22 --> 4252.32]  in a matter of time,
[4252.40 --> 4253.10]  they start asking,
[4253.32 --> 4254.22]  why should I be required?
[4254.84 --> 4256.16]  Or why should anything be required of me?
[4257.94 --> 4261.92]  Why should I heed the discipline and the demand?
[4262.88 --> 4264.70]  What we can learn from this, right,
[4264.72 --> 4267.42]  is that it is actually the high demand
[4267.42 --> 4270.54]  and an expectation of accountability and discipline
[4270.54 --> 4274.14]  that is compelling to so many people.
[4274.94 --> 4276.36]  In a world that says,
[4276.68 --> 4277.44]  anything goes,
[4278.28 --> 4279.36]  do whatever you want,
[4279.46 --> 4280.54]  just don't hurt others.
[4280.88 --> 4282.14]  Or, I mean, probably more accurate,
[4282.22 --> 4282.82]  do whatever you want,
[4282.86 --> 4284.46]  just don't hurt others without their consent.
[4286.46 --> 4287.54]  A group, then,
[4287.58 --> 4289.48]  that comes into this culture and moment
[4289.48 --> 4291.66]  and has expectations on each other,
[4291.94 --> 4292.60]  that has limited,
[4292.94 --> 4295.02]  legitimate demands on those who participate,
[4295.32 --> 4297.68]  that holds us to a high standard,
[4297.98 --> 4298.12]  right,
[4298.12 --> 4300.10]  that actually lives those demands well,
[4300.38 --> 4301.52]  and yes, absolutely,
[4301.78 --> 4303.02]  lives them gracefully,
[4303.52 --> 4305.36]  is actually really,
[4305.60 --> 4307.26]  deeply compelling
[4307.26 --> 4308.74]  and beautiful.
[4310.84 --> 4312.34]  And, let me be clear,
[4312.48 --> 4314.50]  that shouldn't really surprise any of us
[4314.50 --> 4316.64]  who have studied church history.
[4317.70 --> 4319.04]  Right, in the early church,
[4319.70 --> 4321.04]  especially in the first few centuries
[4321.04 --> 4323.08]  when the Roman Empire
[4323.08 --> 4325.32]  is sort of at its zenith, right,
[4325.62 --> 4327.88]  that's also a sex-saturated,
[4328.06 --> 4329.42]  promiscuous culture.
[4329.82 --> 4331.58]  And the Christian church comes along
[4331.58 --> 4334.54]  and it raises the bar of sexual ethics,
[4334.68 --> 4337.50]  primarily for men in that society,
[4337.50 --> 4339.00]  to what was previously thought
[4339.00 --> 4341.58]  impossible levels.
[4343.02 --> 4343.98]  And that was compelling,
[4344.10 --> 4344.96]  not only for men,
[4345.08 --> 4347.42]  but for women and for households
[4347.42 --> 4348.98]  and for countless people
[4348.98 --> 4350.98]  and the church grew exponentially
[4351.74 --> 4353.20]  in that time.
[4356.54 --> 4357.34]  And so,
[4357.76 --> 4359.58]  as a church,
[4359.82 --> 4361.14]  there are ways
[4361.14 --> 4362.20]  and there are systems
[4362.20 --> 4362.98]  that we have developed
[4363.90 --> 4366.66]  to sort of institutionalize discipline.
[4367.20 --> 4368.08]  And that's important
[4368.08 --> 4369.44]  and that is good, right?
[4369.74 --> 4371.32]  We have elders here
[4371.32 --> 4372.60]  who are people
[4372.60 --> 4373.60]  who have been nominated
[4373.60 --> 4375.48]  and then selected by lot
[4375.48 --> 4376.06]  to serve
[4376.06 --> 4377.30]  and have been given
[4377.30 --> 4378.64]  spiritual authority
[4378.64 --> 4379.48]  over myself
[4379.48 --> 4380.90]  and over us all
[4380.90 --> 4382.28]  as members together.
[4382.40 --> 4384.00]  Our elders have the responsibility
[4384.00 --> 4384.90]  to encourage
[4384.90 --> 4386.72]  and ensure holiness.
[4386.72 --> 4389.58]  and so,
[4389.72 --> 4390.42]  in the past,
[4390.94 --> 4393.44]  we have needed to have conversations
[4393.44 --> 4394.86]  about discipline
[4394.86 --> 4396.54]  and about what that looks like.
[4397.42 --> 4398.46]  And some people,
[4398.78 --> 4398.94]  right,
[4399.00 --> 4399.98]  instead of choosing
[4399.98 --> 4401.38]  to receive that discipline,
[4401.60 --> 4402.72]  have chosen to withdraw
[4402.72 --> 4403.56]  from the fellowship
[4403.56 --> 4404.94]  and they've walked away.
[4405.32 --> 4406.98]  And that should break our hearts.
[4406.98 --> 4409.36]  that does break our hearts.
[4410.18 --> 4410.66]  And yet,
[4410.72 --> 4412.06]  there have also been times
[4412.06 --> 4413.28]  where some people
[4413.28 --> 4414.24]  have entered into
[4414.24 --> 4415.62]  that conversation,
[4415.76 --> 4417.52]  have received that accountability
[4417.52 --> 4418.68]  and discipline
[4418.68 --> 4419.88]  and have repented
[4419.88 --> 4421.70]  and started making deep changes
[4421.70 --> 4422.80]  to their life,
[4422.86 --> 4423.58]  who've recognized
[4423.58 --> 4424.62]  and heeded the wisdom
[4424.62 --> 4426.04]  and are now living into
[4426.04 --> 4427.38]  and out of it,
[4427.50 --> 4428.32]  seeking restoration
[4428.32 --> 4429.16]  to Jesus
[4429.16 --> 4430.16]  and the body.
[4430.34 --> 4430.96]  And that,
[4431.18 --> 4432.96]  that is a beautiful picture
[4432.96 --> 4434.36]  of life together
[4434.36 --> 4436.06]  lived in the gospel.
[4436.98 --> 4438.66]  And this isn't just
[4438.66 --> 4439.66]  for the elders now,
[4439.78 --> 4440.12]  right?
[4440.16 --> 4441.66]  This is for all of us
[4441.66 --> 4443.94]  in different capacities
[4443.94 --> 4445.06]  and in different ways.
[4445.18 --> 4446.24]  But we all
[4446.24 --> 4447.32]  have the responsibility
[4447.32 --> 4449.76]  to encourage one another
[4449.76 --> 4451.58]  with these words.
[4453.48 --> 4454.06]  Now, again,
[4454.76 --> 4455.70]  one last point here
[4455.70 --> 4457.06]  because sometimes
[4457.06 --> 4457.82]  you'll start to hear
[4457.82 --> 4458.60]  what I'm not saying.
[4459.02 --> 4460.10]  In verse 17,
[4460.98 --> 4461.80]  Jesus says,
[4462.30 --> 4463.52]  if they still refuse to listen,
[4463.66 --> 4464.36]  tell it to the church
[4464.36 --> 4465.52]  and if they refuse to listen
[4465.52 --> 4466.36]  even to the church,
[4466.36 --> 4467.54]  treat them as you would
[4467.54 --> 4469.80]  a pagan or tax collector.
[4471.16 --> 4471.34]  Now,
[4471.36 --> 4472.20]  sometimes people
[4472.20 --> 4473.20]  hear that word
[4473.20 --> 4474.98]  and especially church people,
[4475.10 --> 4476.04]  we know that pagan
[4476.04 --> 4476.96]  is supposed to be
[4476.96 --> 4478.06]  like a dirty word
[4478.06 --> 4479.40]  and tax collector
[4479.40 --> 4480.26]  for a Jewish person
[4480.26 --> 4481.32]  was a dirty word.
[4482.12 --> 4482.56]  Right?
[4482.60 --> 4483.24]  And so then we think,
[4483.30 --> 4483.48]  pssh,
[4484.00 --> 4484.90]  have nothing to do with them.
[4485.66 --> 4485.78]  Right?
[4485.82 --> 4486.50]  Do not associate
[4486.50 --> 4487.70]  even with them.
[4489.04 --> 4490.60]  But remember who Jesus is.
[4491.98 --> 4493.22]  Remember what Jesus did.
[4494.04 --> 4495.12]  Jesus ate
[4495.12 --> 4496.46]  with tax collectors
[4496.46 --> 4497.48]  and sinners.
[4497.84 --> 4498.98]  Jesus shared his life
[4498.98 --> 4499.62]  with pagans
[4499.62 --> 4501.04]  and prostitutes.
[4503.52 --> 4504.60]  Even those people
[4504.60 --> 4505.90]  who are receiving discipline,
[4506.04 --> 4506.96]  perhaps especially
[4506.96 --> 4507.62]  those people
[4507.62 --> 4509.04]  who are receiving discipline,
[4509.24 --> 4510.12]  we need to eat with them.
[4511.28 --> 4512.62]  We need to share life with them.
[4513.78 --> 4515.62]  And these people
[4515.62 --> 4516.70]  who are in the middle
[4516.70 --> 4517.42]  of struggle
[4517.42 --> 4518.68]  and who are facing sin
[4518.68 --> 4519.58]  in a hard way,
[4519.68 --> 4521.92]  even if you're losing
[4521.92 --> 4522.64]  the battle.
[4523.52 --> 4525.08]  Jesus regularly
[4525.08 --> 4526.58]  treats people
[4526.58 --> 4528.40]  in this situation
[4528.40 --> 4529.60]  with remarkable
[4529.60 --> 4532.28]  and unparalleled compassion.
[4533.04 --> 4534.24]  And we need to do the same.
[4536.46 --> 4537.06]  But,
[4537.82 --> 4539.44]  Jesus doesn't treat them
[4539.44 --> 4540.20]  as disciples
[4540.20 --> 4541.80]  until they repent.
[4543.50 --> 4543.66]  Right?
[4543.70 --> 4544.70]  The removal of fellowship
[4544.70 --> 4545.72]  that Jesus has in mind
[4545.72 --> 4546.52]  doesn't mean
[4546.52 --> 4547.70]  no further contact.
[4548.54 --> 4548.90]  Instead,
[4549.20 --> 4549.64]  it means
[4549.64 --> 4550.52]  it's not allowing them
[4550.52 --> 4552.40]  to have the identity
[4552.40 --> 4553.24]  of disciple,
[4553.44 --> 4554.24]  to have the opportunity
[4554.24 --> 4555.06]  that is reserved
[4555.06 --> 4555.78]  for disciples,
[4556.00 --> 4556.56]  for Christians
[4556.56 --> 4557.88]  until repentance happens.
[4559.40 --> 4559.50]  Right?
[4559.54 --> 4560.48]  We have
[4560.48 --> 4561.54]  and have
[4561.54 --> 4564.00]  as a family here,
[4564.70 --> 4566.00]  we cannot be afraid
[4566.00 --> 4567.28]  of words
[4567.28 --> 4568.32]  of discipline
[4568.32 --> 4569.30]  because they're hard
[4569.30 --> 4569.88]  to speak.
[4571.18 --> 4571.84]  The author
[4571.84 --> 4572.30]  of the letter
[4572.30 --> 4573.58]  to the Hebrew
[4573.58 --> 4574.28]  says that
[4574.28 --> 4575.24]  God disciplines
[4575.24 --> 4575.98]  those whom
[4575.98 --> 4576.46]  he treats
[4576.46 --> 4577.08]  as a son.
[4578.24 --> 4578.84]  Remember that
[4578.84 --> 4579.80]  conversation about adoption?
[4579.92 --> 4580.98]  There is a straight line
[4580.98 --> 4581.90]  from adoption
[4581.90 --> 4582.98]  to sonship
[4582.98 --> 4584.26]  and that line
[4584.26 --> 4584.86]  is discipline.
[4585.92 --> 4586.70]  And like a parent
[4586.70 --> 4587.72]  of any child,
[4587.80 --> 4588.64]  if you have had
[4588.64 --> 4589.18]  the opportunity
[4589.18 --> 4589.80]  to parent
[4589.80 --> 4590.92]  and to need
[4590.92 --> 4591.52]  to discipline
[4591.52 --> 4592.02]  your child,
[4592.14 --> 4592.54]  you know
[4592.54 --> 4593.28]  that that is
[4593.28 --> 4594.26]  the line
[4594.26 --> 4595.26]  of love.
[4599.60 --> 4600.26]  And so,
[4600.36 --> 4600.68]  yes,
[4601.12 --> 4601.94]  it is hard
[4601.94 --> 4604.82]  and it is intimidating.
[4604.82 --> 4606.92]  but it is
[4606.92 --> 4607.92]  what we must
[4607.92 --> 4609.02]  do
[4609.02 --> 4610.04]  together.
[4613.36 --> 4614.20]  Third reason
[4614.20 --> 4614.52]  why
[4614.52 --> 4615.86]  Jesus gives
[4615.86 --> 4616.64]  us
[4616.64 --> 4617.18]  for
[4617.18 --> 4618.52]  the reason
[4618.52 --> 4619.50]  why we gather
[4619.50 --> 4620.22]  is that word
[4620.22 --> 4620.82]  that I used
[4620.82 --> 4621.56]  earlier,
[4621.70 --> 4621.96]  that word
[4621.96 --> 4622.98]  sacralizing.
[4623.86 --> 4624.60]  Jesus says
[4624.60 --> 4625.74]  in verse 18,
[4626.78 --> 4627.58]  truly I tell you,
[4627.66 --> 4628.34]  whatever you bind
[4628.34 --> 4628.84]  on earth
[4628.84 --> 4629.40]  will be bound
[4629.40 --> 4629.80]  in heaven
[4629.80 --> 4630.82]  and whatever you
[4630.82 --> 4631.60]  loose on earth
[4631.60 --> 4632.34]  will be loosed
[4632.34 --> 4633.52]  in heaven.
[4634.60 --> 4634.74]  Now,
[4634.78 --> 4635.88]  to sacralize
[4635.88 --> 4636.96]  means to
[4636.96 --> 4637.76]  imbue
[4637.76 --> 4639.24]  with spiritual
[4639.24 --> 4640.64]  and sacred
[4640.64 --> 4641.56]  meaning.
[4642.64 --> 4643.38]  And I think
[4643.38 --> 4643.90]  that's part
[4643.90 --> 4644.50]  of what Jesus
[4644.50 --> 4645.84]  means in this
[4645.84 --> 4646.22]  phrase.
[4646.64 --> 4647.40]  Jesus takes
[4647.40 --> 4648.20]  the ordinary
[4648.20 --> 4649.82]  and he imbues
[4649.82 --> 4650.70]  it with deep
[4650.70 --> 4652.00]  and spiritual
[4652.00 --> 4653.00]  sacred
[4653.00 --> 4653.76]  meaning.
[4655.16 --> 4655.96]  In a moment
[4655.96 --> 4656.58]  as we come
[4656.58 --> 4657.14]  to the table
[4657.14 --> 4657.82]  we will see
[4657.82 --> 4658.54]  how he does
[4658.54 --> 4659.26]  this with bread
[4659.26 --> 4660.14]  and juice
[4660.14 --> 4660.66]  saying that
[4660.66 --> 4661.64]  this bread
[4661.64 --> 4663.00]  is his flesh
[4663.00 --> 4664.46]  and this juice
[4664.46 --> 4665.84]  is his blood.
[4665.96 --> 4666.76]  In the Lord's Supper
[4666.76 --> 4667.76]  in the Eucharist
[4667.76 --> 4669.32]  we truly receive
[4669.32 --> 4670.30]  the spiritual
[4670.30 --> 4671.30]  presence of Jesus
[4671.30 --> 4672.10]  through these
[4672.10 --> 4673.52]  otherwise ordinary
[4673.52 --> 4674.46]  elements.
[4675.44 --> 4675.94]  Likewise,
[4676.22 --> 4676.62]  right now
[4676.62 --> 4677.34]  in this moment
[4677.34 --> 4678.34]  in the preaching
[4678.34 --> 4679.10]  of the word
[4679.10 --> 4680.18]  Jesus uses
[4680.18 --> 4680.92]  the ordinary
[4680.92 --> 4682.18]  means of preaching
[4682.18 --> 4683.22]  of speaking
[4683.22 --> 4683.88]  the gospel
[4683.88 --> 4685.06]  and transforms
[4685.06 --> 4685.88]  that into
[4685.88 --> 4686.98]  the extraordinary
[4686.98 --> 4687.88]  encounter
[4687.88 --> 4688.84]  with the living God.
[4690.10 --> 4691.34]  God comes alive
[4691.34 --> 4692.74]  on the pages
[4692.74 --> 4694.50]  of his revelation.
[4695.96 --> 4696.38]  And likewise
[4696.38 --> 4697.62]  in our worship
[4697.62 --> 4698.72]  we gather
[4698.72 --> 4699.50]  as believers
[4699.50 --> 4700.34]  and disciples
[4700.34 --> 4701.74]  to sing songs
[4701.74 --> 4702.38]  and hymns
[4702.38 --> 4703.54]  and spiritual songs
[4703.54 --> 4704.20]  in praise
[4704.20 --> 4704.90]  of our God
[4704.90 --> 4705.92]  and to encourage
[4705.92 --> 4706.68]  one another
[4706.68 --> 4707.42]  with these things.
[4708.78 --> 4710.56]  But as we do so
[4710.56 --> 4712.76]  in a very real sense
[4712.76 --> 4715.08]  we hear about this
[4715.08 --> 4715.96]  in the book
[4715.96 --> 4716.58]  of Revelations
[4716.58 --> 4717.60]  chapter 4 and 5
[4717.60 --> 4719.10]  as we come together
[4719.10 --> 4720.20]  in our worship
[4720.20 --> 4721.62]  we see that
[4721.62 --> 4723.02]  we're participating
[4723.02 --> 4724.14]  in the heavens
[4724.14 --> 4725.68]  themselves opening up
[4725.68 --> 4726.94]  and the angels
[4726.94 --> 4728.58]  and the 24 elders
[4728.58 --> 4729.32]  and the creatures
[4729.32 --> 4730.84]  praising God.
[4731.52 --> 4732.86]  In a very sense
[4732.86 --> 4734.36]  our worship here
[4734.36 --> 4735.86]  participates
[4735.86 --> 4737.28]  in all of creation
[4737.28 --> 4739.18]  giving glory to God
[4739.18 --> 4740.56]  and in this act
[4740.56 --> 4741.46]  of our voices
[4741.46 --> 4742.44]  being lifted up
[4742.44 --> 4743.82]  the stones themselves
[4743.82 --> 4744.92]  are crying out
[4744.92 --> 4745.54]  and the trees
[4745.54 --> 4746.10]  of the field
[4746.10 --> 4747.54]  are clapping their hands
[4747.54 --> 4748.08]  and the sun
[4748.08 --> 4748.82]  and the moon
[4748.82 --> 4749.44]  and the stars
[4749.44 --> 4751.14]  twinkle in praises
[4751.14 --> 4752.46]  ushering forth
[4752.46 --> 4753.62]  in glory to God.
[4753.70 --> 4754.48]  We are joining
[4754.48 --> 4756.00]  in all of that
[4756.00 --> 4757.28]  here and now
[4757.28 --> 4757.98]  together.
[4759.76 --> 4761.02]  And here too
[4761.02 --> 4762.70]  the image
[4762.70 --> 4763.56]  of the church
[4763.56 --> 4764.46]  that we get
[4764.46 --> 4765.36]  in the New Testament
[4765.36 --> 4766.88]  as a bride
[4766.88 --> 4768.28]  who is being prepared
[4768.28 --> 4769.22]  for the groom
[4769.22 --> 4770.28]  who is Jesus
[4770.28 --> 4771.66]  that when Jesus
[4771.66 --> 4772.96]  returns one day
[4772.96 --> 4773.62]  at the sound
[4773.62 --> 4774.14]  of the trumpet
[4774.14 --> 4775.30]  with the call
[4775.30 --> 4776.18]  of the archangel
[4776.18 --> 4777.06]  as he returns
[4777.06 --> 4777.80]  to earth
[4777.80 --> 4779.02]  he will receive
[4779.02 --> 4780.00]  the prize
[4780.00 --> 4781.04]  for which he died
[4781.04 --> 4782.06]  and that is you
[4782.06 --> 4782.84]  and me.
[4783.54 --> 4784.52]  That is the church
[4784.52 --> 4785.18]  Catholic
[4785.18 --> 4786.14]  throughout all times
[4786.14 --> 4786.76]  and places
[4786.76 --> 4788.02]  and we are being
[4788.02 --> 4789.26]  prepared as a bride
[4789.26 --> 4791.10]  beautifully adorned
[4791.10 --> 4792.08]  for the bridegroom.
[4793.34 --> 4794.86]  That is we are set apart.
[4796.06 --> 4797.90]  We are made holy.
[4798.64 --> 4799.60]  That's what the word
[4799.60 --> 4800.78]  holy means
[4800.78 --> 4801.84]  to be set apart
[4801.84 --> 4802.84]  for a purpose.
[4803.22 --> 4803.90]  Peter says
[4803.90 --> 4805.28]  you are a chosen people
[4805.28 --> 4806.56]  a royal priesthood
[4806.56 --> 4808.16]  a holy nation
[4808.16 --> 4810.92]  a special possession.
[4812.32 --> 4814.36]  We are made sacred
[4814.36 --> 4816.62]  and so our gathering here
[4816.62 --> 4819.02]  is a mark of that being made holy
[4819.02 --> 4820.00]  and an expression
[4820.00 --> 4822.20]  of that sacral meaning.
[4823.98 --> 4826.04]  And so each week
[4826.04 --> 4826.82]  when we come
[4826.82 --> 4828.46]  and we hear the truth
[4828.46 --> 4829.28]  proclaimed
[4829.28 --> 4831.12]  that Jesus lived the life
[4831.12 --> 4831.92]  I should have lived
[4831.92 --> 4833.10]  and that same Jesus
[4833.10 --> 4833.96]  died the death
[4833.96 --> 4834.62]  that I deserve
[4834.62 --> 4835.58]  because of sin
[4835.58 --> 4836.52]  and that same Jesus
[4836.52 --> 4837.90]  was three days later
[4837.90 --> 4838.92]  raised victorious
[4838.92 --> 4840.00]  over sin and death
[4840.00 --> 4840.86]  and that same Jesus
[4840.86 --> 4841.76]  has ascended
[4841.76 --> 4842.58]  to the right hand
[4842.58 --> 4843.26]  of God the Father
[4843.26 --> 4844.20]  and that same Jesus
[4844.20 --> 4845.24]  from the right hand
[4845.24 --> 4845.82]  of God the Father
[4845.82 --> 4846.66]  along with the Father
[4846.66 --> 4847.56]  has sent the Spirit
[4847.56 --> 4849.58]  now to live in you
[4849.58 --> 4850.76]  and that same Jesus
[4850.76 --> 4852.36]  will one day return
[4852.36 --> 4853.60]  when we hear that
[4853.60 --> 4854.96]  week in and week out.
[4855.26 --> 4856.20]  Not only are we
[4856.20 --> 4857.78]  proclaiming a news
[4857.78 --> 4858.64]  that is true
[4858.64 --> 4859.30]  for the world
[4859.30 --> 4860.42]  but we are hearing
[4860.42 --> 4861.30]  and receiving
[4861.30 --> 4862.30]  an identity
[4862.30 --> 4864.36]  that will last
[4864.36 --> 4865.22]  forever
[4865.22 --> 4867.18]  because He
[4867.18 --> 4868.10]  has called you
[4868.10 --> 4868.54]  Son
[4868.54 --> 4871.12]  He has made you
[4871.12 --> 4872.68]  an heir of God
[4872.68 --> 4873.68]  and a co-heir
[4873.68 --> 4875.04]  with Christ
[4875.04 --> 4876.12]  that
[4876.12 --> 4877.36]  is who
[4877.36 --> 4878.32]  we
[4878.32 --> 4879.48]  are
[4879.48 --> 4881.68]  and in our
[4881.68 --> 4882.26]  gathering
[4882.26 --> 4883.90]  we are given
[4883.90 --> 4885.16]  a heavenly
[4885.16 --> 4886.40]  purpose
[4886.40 --> 4887.96]  in our gathering
[4887.96 --> 4889.28]  we are equipped
[4889.28 --> 4891.40]  to cast off
[4891.40 --> 4892.72]  the bonds of sin
[4892.72 --> 4893.62]  which so easily
[4893.62 --> 4894.14]  entangle
[4894.14 --> 4895.18]  and we are encouraged
[4895.18 --> 4896.12]  to run the race
[4896.12 --> 4897.62]  that was marked out
[4897.62 --> 4898.20]  before us
[4898.20 --> 4899.04]  with perseverance
[4899.04 --> 4901.70]  in our holy
[4901.70 --> 4902.56]  gathering
[4902.56 --> 4903.92]  the holy church
[4903.92 --> 4906.06]  fixes her holy eyes
[4906.06 --> 4907.40]  on the holy Jesus
[4907.40 --> 4908.58]  so that even
[4908.58 --> 4909.48]  what we do
[4909.48 --> 4910.78]  in this profane
[4910.78 --> 4911.92]  and unholy world
[4911.92 --> 4912.96]  is made sacred
[4912.96 --> 4914.40]  is made worshipful
[4914.40 --> 4915.08]  worshipful
[4915.08 --> 4915.84]  is brought
[4915.84 --> 4916.68]  into the
[4916.68 --> 4917.34]  glory
[4917.34 --> 4918.28]  of God
[4918.28 --> 4919.56]  or to put it
[4919.56 --> 4920.02]  another way
[4920.02 --> 4920.56]  a way that you've
[4920.56 --> 4921.12]  heard me say
[4921.12 --> 4921.82]  before
[4921.82 --> 4922.72]  we gather
[4922.72 --> 4923.60]  in order to
[4923.60 --> 4924.02]  scatter
[4924.02 --> 4925.02]  because all of
[4925.02 --> 4925.36]  life
[4925.36 --> 4926.50]  is worship
[4926.50 --> 4929.68]  finally
[4929.68 --> 4930.36]  lastly
[4930.36 --> 4932.14]  the fourth reason
[4932.14 --> 4932.62]  we gather
[4932.62 --> 4933.36]  from this text
[4933.36 --> 4935.12]  Jesus says
[4935.12 --> 4936.44]  here in
[4936.44 --> 4937.94]  verse
[4937.94 --> 4938.84]  19
[4938.84 --> 4940.48]  again
[4940.48 --> 4941.62]  truly I tell you
[4941.62 --> 4942.54]  that if two of you
[4942.54 --> 4943.28]  on earth agree
[4943.28 --> 4943.88]  about anything
[4943.88 --> 4944.74]  they ask for it
[4944.74 --> 4945.74]  it will be done
[4945.74 --> 4946.18]  for them
[4946.18 --> 4946.90]  by my father
[4946.90 --> 4947.36]  in heaven
[4947.36 --> 4948.68]  for where two
[4948.68 --> 4949.58]  or three gather
[4949.58 --> 4950.80]  in my name
[4950.80 --> 4952.60]  there I am
[4952.60 --> 4953.12]  with them
[4953.12 --> 4956.66]  this is why we
[4956.66 --> 4957.00]  gather
[4957.00 --> 4958.52]  in Jesus name
[4958.52 --> 4959.66]  this is why we
[4959.66 --> 4959.98]  pray
[4959.98 --> 4960.52]  and why we
[4960.52 --> 4961.42]  teach our kids
[4961.42 --> 4961.96]  to pray
[4961.96 --> 4963.24]  in Jesus name
[4963.24 --> 4964.14]  because when we
[4964.14 --> 4964.92]  gather in
[4964.92 --> 4966.10]  Jesus name
[4966.10 --> 4967.40]  he is
[4967.40 --> 4968.10]  here
[4968.10 --> 4970.26]  here and now
[4970.26 --> 4971.20]  Jesus is
[4971.20 --> 4971.72]  here
[4971.72 --> 4972.40]  he meets
[4972.40 --> 4972.88]  you
[4972.88 --> 4973.64]  in this
[4973.64 --> 4973.82]  place
[4973.82 --> 4974.14]  even
[4974.14 --> 4975.40]  2000 years
[4975.40 --> 4976.04]  later
[4976.04 --> 4977.18]  after he
[4977.18 --> 4978.40]  has ascended
[4978.40 --> 4979.16]  he has sent
[4979.16 --> 4980.48]  his Holy Spirit
[4980.48 --> 4981.24]  and he
[4981.24 --> 4982.46]  is here
[4982.46 --> 4983.52]  and if you
[4983.52 --> 4983.86]  have trouble
[4983.86 --> 4984.58]  believing that
[4984.58 --> 4985.64]  if you have
[4985.64 --> 4986.22]  trouble seeing
[4986.22 --> 4986.62]  that
[4986.62 --> 4987.70]  look to the
[4987.70 --> 4988.16]  person on
[4988.16 --> 4988.60]  your left
[4988.60 --> 4990.30]  look to your
[4990.30 --> 4990.52]  left
[4990.52 --> 4990.96]  look at that
[4990.96 --> 4991.26]  person
[4991.26 --> 4993.28]  there's Jesus
[4993.28 --> 4994.58]  if you have
[4994.58 --> 4995.08]  trouble believing
[4995.08 --> 4995.46]  that look to
[4995.46 --> 4995.76]  the person
[4995.76 --> 4996.28]  on your right
[4996.28 --> 4998.14]  there's Jesus
[4998.14 --> 4999.84]  as Jesus
[4999.84 --> 5000.82]  lives by the
[5000.82 --> 5001.12]  Spirit
[5001.12 --> 5001.90]  in your
[5001.90 --> 5002.32]  hearts
[5002.32 --> 5002.94]  and as we
[5002.94 --> 5003.76]  come together
[5003.76 --> 5004.64]  there's this
[5004.64 --> 5005.60]  movement
[5005.60 --> 5006.48]  this beauty
[5006.48 --> 5007.20]  this power
[5007.20 --> 5007.98]  of Jesus
[5007.98 --> 5008.58]  coming
[5008.58 --> 5009.78]  to us
[5009.78 --> 5010.76]  right in the
[5010.76 --> 5011.46]  heart of
[5011.46 --> 5012.36]  those who
[5012.36 --> 5012.70]  believe
[5012.70 --> 5013.02]  and there's
[5013.02 --> 5013.72]  something unique
[5013.72 --> 5014.86]  and special
[5014.86 --> 5015.44]  about when
[5015.44 --> 5015.92]  those who
[5015.92 --> 5016.64]  carry Jesus
[5016.64 --> 5017.54]  in their
[5017.54 --> 5017.88]  hearts
[5017.88 --> 5018.62]  come together
[5018.62 --> 5019.28]  that the
[5019.28 --> 5019.90]  presence of
[5019.90 --> 5020.20]  Jesus
[5020.20 --> 5021.48]  is magnified
[5021.48 --> 5022.40]  it grows
[5022.40 --> 5023.32]  it is increased
[5023.32 --> 5024.08]  exponentially
[5024.08 --> 5025.40]  in our midst
[5025.40 --> 5025.88]  there is
[5025.88 --> 5027.00]  something special
[5027.00 --> 5028.16]  about gathered
[5028.16 --> 5028.82]  worship
[5028.82 --> 5029.62]  and that is
[5029.62 --> 5030.32]  that Jesus
[5030.32 --> 5031.60]  meets you
[5031.60 --> 5032.32]  here
[5032.32 --> 5036.40]  we gather
[5036.40 --> 5037.54]  because we
[5037.54 --> 5038.16]  need accountability
[5038.16 --> 5040.36]  we gather
[5040.36 --> 5040.82]  because we
[5040.82 --> 5041.86]  require discipline
[5041.86 --> 5043.56]  we gather
[5043.56 --> 5044.26]  to be made
[5044.26 --> 5045.00]  holy and to
[5045.00 --> 5045.64]  be sent out
[5045.64 --> 5046.32]  with a sacred
[5046.32 --> 5047.20]  purpose
[5047.20 --> 5048.24]  and we gather
[5048.24 --> 5049.20]  because here
[5049.20 --> 5050.30]  we are welcomed
[5050.30 --> 5051.22]  in the presence
[5051.22 --> 5052.04]  of Jesus
[5052.04 --> 5053.52]  here we receive
[5053.52 --> 5054.96]  spiritual food
[5054.96 --> 5055.78]  that we need
[5055.78 --> 5056.38]  for life
[5056.38 --> 5057.28]  and faith
[5057.28 --> 5057.96]  in him
[5057.96 --> 5058.70]  here
[5058.70 --> 5059.52]  Jesus
[5059.52 --> 5060.80]  is made
[5060.80 --> 5061.54]  real
[5061.54 --> 5062.46]  here
[5062.46 --> 5063.54]  we see
[5063.54 --> 5064.04]  Jesus
[5064.04 --> 5064.88]  and so when we
[5064.88 --> 5066.10]  pick up the bread
[5066.10 --> 5067.22]  like Jesus did
[5067.22 --> 5068.54]  when after supper
[5068.54 --> 5069.44]  he had given thanks
[5069.44 --> 5070.12]  he took the bread
[5070.12 --> 5070.82]  and he broke it
[5070.82 --> 5071.26]  and he said
[5071.26 --> 5072.60]  this is my body
[5072.60 --> 5073.98]  which is for you
[5073.98 --> 5074.92]  do this
[5074.92 --> 5075.64]  in remembrance
[5075.64 --> 5076.34]  of me
[5076.34 --> 5077.08]  Jesus
[5077.08 --> 5078.54]  is here
[5078.54 --> 5079.96]  in the supper
[5079.96 --> 5082.34]  and in the same way
[5082.34 --> 5083.70]  he took the cup
[5083.70 --> 5084.58]  when they had finished
[5084.58 --> 5086.38]  and he gave thanks
[5086.38 --> 5086.84]  and he said
[5086.84 --> 5087.44]  this cup
[5087.44 --> 5088.72]  is the new covenant
[5088.72 --> 5090.00]  in my blood
[5090.00 --> 5091.20]  do this
[5091.20 --> 5092.34]  in remembrance
[5092.34 --> 5093.64]  of me
[5093.64 --> 5095.48]  for whenever we
[5095.48 --> 5096.18]  eat this bread
[5096.18 --> 5096.90]  and drink
[5096.90 --> 5097.96]  this cup
[5097.96 --> 5098.66]  we proclaim
[5098.66 --> 5099.46]  the Lord's death
[5099.46 --> 5100.56]  until he comes again
[5100.56 --> 5101.58]  and
[5101.58 --> 5104.18]  we meet
[5104.18 --> 5105.32]  Jesus
[5105.32 --> 5107.76]  we gather
[5107.76 --> 5108.62]  at this table
[5108.62 --> 5111.14]  because Jesus
[5111.14 --> 5112.98]  is here
[5112.98 --> 5114.24]  with us
[5114.24 --> 5115.20]  Christians
[5115.20 --> 5116.40]  throughout
[5116.40 --> 5117.36]  history
[5117.36 --> 5118.40]  have gathered
[5118.40 --> 5119.40]  at this table
[5119.40 --> 5120.50]  because Jesus
[5120.50 --> 5121.58]  is here
[5121.58 --> 5122.74]  with us
[5122.74 --> 5124.30]  today
[5124.30 --> 5125.62]  we're going to
[5125.62 --> 5126.76]  celebrate the Lord's
[5126.76 --> 5127.00]  Supper
[5127.00 --> 5128.40]  using
[5128.40 --> 5130.24]  different liturgy
[5130.24 --> 5131.22]  than what you might
[5131.22 --> 5131.78]  be used to
[5131.78 --> 5132.36]  now
[5132.36 --> 5132.92]  liturgy
[5132.92 --> 5133.86]  is the church
[5133.86 --> 5134.34]  word
[5134.34 --> 5135.68]  the word that we use
[5135.68 --> 5136.12]  in church
[5136.12 --> 5136.68]  for those things
[5136.68 --> 5137.32]  that we say
[5137.32 --> 5138.16]  and speak
[5138.16 --> 5138.88]  or those actions
[5138.88 --> 5139.52]  that we take
[5139.52 --> 5141.18]  this morning
[5141.18 --> 5142.30]  our liturgy
[5142.30 --> 5143.18]  comes from
[5143.18 --> 5144.02]  the Didache
[5144.02 --> 5145.44]  Didache
[5145.44 --> 5146.66]  is a Greek word
[5146.66 --> 5147.66]  and a Greek document
[5147.66 --> 5148.70]  called the teachings
[5148.70 --> 5149.32]  sometimes called
[5149.32 --> 5149.78]  the teachings
[5149.78 --> 5150.48]  of the apostles
[5150.48 --> 5152.20]  and it dates
[5152.20 --> 5153.56]  back to the first
[5153.56 --> 5154.28]  century
[5154.28 --> 5155.46]  of the church
[5155.46 --> 5156.92]  that means
[5156.92 --> 5157.90]  that some of the
[5157.90 --> 5158.86]  writings in the Didache
[5158.86 --> 5159.62]  are older
[5159.62 --> 5160.70]  than the New Testament
[5160.70 --> 5161.60]  writings that we have
[5161.60 --> 5163.82]  my point is
[5163.82 --> 5164.98]  these practices
[5164.98 --> 5166.50]  are ancient
[5166.50 --> 5167.70]  the words that we
[5167.70 --> 5168.60]  are about to speak
[5168.60 --> 5169.64]  being ancient
[5169.64 --> 5171.04]  are uniting us
[5171.04 --> 5172.00]  with the church
[5172.00 --> 5173.38]  of 2,000 years
[5173.38 --> 5174.40]  of history
[5174.40 --> 5175.76]  because we all
[5175.76 --> 5176.34]  gather
[5176.34 --> 5177.28]  here
[5177.28 --> 5178.28]  at this
[5178.28 --> 5179.36]  table
[5179.36 --> 5181.60]  now the early
[5181.60 --> 5182.94]  Greek speaking church
[5182.94 --> 5184.28]  called the Lord's
[5184.28 --> 5184.52]  Supper
[5184.52 --> 5185.48]  the Eucharist
[5185.48 --> 5186.42]  which means
[5186.42 --> 5186.92]  in Greek
[5186.92 --> 5187.84]  the Thanksgiving
[5187.84 --> 5189.40]  and the root
[5189.40 --> 5190.06]  of the word
[5190.06 --> 5190.60]  Eucharist
[5190.60 --> 5191.32]  is charis
[5191.32 --> 5191.78]  we have some
[5191.78 --> 5192.54]  charises here
[5192.54 --> 5193.82]  it means grace
[5193.82 --> 5195.12]  or sometimes joy
[5195.12 --> 5196.82]  at the table
[5196.82 --> 5197.64]  of the Lord
[5197.64 --> 5198.88]  we give thanks
[5198.88 --> 5199.70]  for grace
[5199.70 --> 5201.60]  and joy
[5201.60 --> 5202.78]  that we have
[5202.78 --> 5203.42]  received
[5203.42 --> 5204.48]  in the person
[5204.48 --> 5205.52]  of Jesus Christ
[5205.52 --> 5206.80]  and Christians
[5206.80 --> 5207.40]  have been doing
[5207.40 --> 5208.34]  this for millennia
[5208.34 --> 5209.00]  and today
[5209.00 --> 5210.42]  we join
[5210.42 --> 5211.30]  them
[5211.30 --> 5213.42]  throughout the liturgy
[5213.42 --> 5214.14]  that I'm about to
[5214.14 --> 5215.14]  lead us in
[5215.14 --> 5215.56]  there will be
[5215.56 --> 5216.04]  opportunities
[5216.04 --> 5217.38]  for you to respond
[5217.38 --> 5218.08]  those words
[5218.08 --> 5219.54]  will be on screen
[5219.54 --> 5221.24]  and so I invite
[5221.24 --> 5222.46]  you to join
[5222.46 --> 5223.00]  your heart
[5223.00 --> 5223.94]  and your voice
[5223.94 --> 5224.52]  with mine
[5224.52 --> 5225.54]  as we come
[5225.54 --> 5226.50]  to the table
[5226.50 --> 5227.74]  of God
[5227.74 --> 5230.76]  so we pray
[5230.76 --> 5231.16]  together
[5231.16 --> 5233.66]  we give thanks
[5233.66 --> 5234.14]  to you
[5234.14 --> 5234.74]  father
[5234.74 --> 5235.96]  for the holy
[5235.96 --> 5236.82]  vine of your
[5236.82 --> 5237.30]  servant
[5237.30 --> 5238.08]  David

[5239.18 --> 5240.08]  gathered from
[5240.08 --> 5241.14]  all the nations
[5241.14 --> 5242.04]  which you have
[5242.04 --> 5242.64]  made known
[5242.64 --> 5243.22]  to us
