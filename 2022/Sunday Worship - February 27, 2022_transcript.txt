[2450.62 --> 2460.06]  Good morning, my name is Glenn.
[2460.06 --> 2466.14]  I'm one of the elders here at Langley Emanuel, and it is now my privilege to lead you in congregational prayer.
[2468.32 --> 2474.40]  Father in heaven, we thank you for the opportunity to gather here this morning as your local church and to worship you.
[2475.12 --> 2479.40]  You are holy, and you alone are worthy of our praise and adoration.
[2479.40 --> 2487.88]  We thank you for the grace and the mercy shown to us through the life, death, and resurrection of our Lord and Savior Christ Jesus.
[2488.78 --> 2494.70]  We thank you that he took the burden of our sin upon himself, and that we no longer bear that burden.
[2496.30 --> 2504.34]  Give that we appreciate and celebrate this gospel story every day of our lives, and that we live out our calling wherever you place us.
[2504.34 --> 2512.30]  We thank you for this church family, and for the many different gifts that you have given to each member here.
[2513.30 --> 2520.78]  We thank you for the different ways the members of this church use those gifts in service to you, and to one another, and to the community.
[2520.78 --> 2528.34]  We encourage each member to serve with joy and with enthusiasm, particularly during times of difficulty.
[2530.34 --> 2534.40]  We ask that you bless the youth leaders who are attending a retreat this weekend.
[2534.40 --> 2542.70]  We ask that they be encouraged in their work, and that they gain new insights into how to minister effectively to our youth,
[2543.66 --> 2551.00]  particularly in an age where there are so many things competing for their attention and seeking to draw them from you.
[2552.20 --> 2555.10]  Keep our youth grounded and rooted in you.
[2555.10 --> 2562.70]  Bless Nicole Rook and Matt Woods as they make final preparations for their wedding in two weeks' time.
[2563.82 --> 2566.36]  Prepare them for this exciting new chapter in their lives.
[2569.06 --> 2573.84]  Despite the many things we have to celebrate, Lord, we live in a world that is stained by sin,
[2574.36 --> 2581.18]  and this week we were reminded of that as we've witnessed death and the start of war in Europe.
[2581.18 --> 2590.94]  We ask that you be with Pearl and John Denhan and the Limas family as they grieve the sudden loss of Pearl's brother, August.
[2592.08 --> 2595.00]  May they experience your comforting presence as they grieve.
[2596.58 --> 2601.32]  Continue to comfort Allison and Jeff Sanders, because Jeff's father passed away recently.
[2603.56 --> 2606.34]  Father, we also ask that you be with those in the Ukraine.
[2606.34 --> 2615.26]  It's hard to know what to pray for, but Lord, we ask that you put an end to the aggression and war,
[2616.34 --> 2620.64]  and that the people there may experience peace.
[2624.22 --> 2627.20]  Comfort those who have lost loved ones in this conflict.
[2628.62 --> 2635.06]  Be with those who have fled and are now displaced at the borders of Romania and Poland.
[2635.06 --> 2642.18]  Lord, we pray that you would meet their needs in terms of shelter, food, sanitation.
[2643.20 --> 2648.76]  We ask that you bless all the agencies that are tasked with doing that, Lord,
[2648.94 --> 2651.14]  and that their needs may be met.
[2653.72 --> 2658.00]  Father, we ask that you bless those in our congregation who struggle with illness.
[2659.28 --> 2661.14]  Grant healing, if that is your will.
[2661.14 --> 2674.18]  Be with those who care for them, whether they are family members or medical professionals.
[2675.26 --> 2681.14]  Give them wisdom to make the right decisions for their loved ones or patients, as the case may be.
[2683.46 --> 2686.14]  Bless those who are dealing with broken or strained relationships.
[2686.14 --> 2693.32]  We ask for your powerful presence in their lives and for the restoration of these relationships.
[2695.14 --> 2701.70]  We continue to pray for the committee tasked with finding an executive director for the Canadian Christian Reformed Church.
[2702.94 --> 2706.96]  Grant them wisdom as they discern who should be considered for this position.
[2706.96 --> 2712.72]  Father, we thank you for your word given to us.
[2714.12 --> 2717.24]  As we read it and spend time reflecting on it,
[2717.72 --> 2723.46]  we ask that you grant Pastor Chris the ability to proclaim its truth with boldness and with clarity
[2723.46 --> 2728.88]  and help us adopt a posture of willingness to receive the truth of your word.
[2729.96 --> 2734.48]  Yours is the kingdom, the power, and the glory forever.
[2735.08 --> 2735.38]  Amen.
[2735.38 --> 2761.62]  So as we jump into our time together,
[2761.62 --> 2767.54]  particularly for those of you who are here in person this morning,
[2768.04 --> 2771.52]  some of you have already noticed that there's this big white bandage on my thumb,
[2771.90 --> 2773.62]  and it's been distracting for you.
[2773.68 --> 2777.20]  So I just want to dispel the rumors and why it is there.
[2777.62 --> 2780.42]  And as I move my hands around, you aren't further distracted.
[2780.56 --> 2783.82]  But last night I was making dinner, and I was using a mandolin.
[2783.82 --> 2787.26]  I don't need to tell you the rest of the story.
[2789.34 --> 2790.66]  So there's that.
[2791.04 --> 2795.54]  I thought it was better to keep it covered than to risk what else might happen.
[2796.82 --> 2801.12]  We are going to continue looking at the book of Exodus.
[2801.12 --> 2811.98]  Today we are going to look in chapter 16 at the provision of God for the people with manna and quail from heaven.
[2812.18 --> 2819.76]  And before we get into that, I just want to convey a story to you, a personal story, a situation.
[2819.76 --> 2832.54]  A few years ago, in 2018, I had the opportunity to travel with a group of pastors and our spouses to Egypt and Israel and Jordan.
[2832.54 --> 2844.10]  And we came on part of that trip into the region of Timna, Timna National Park, which is just north of Elat,
[2844.22 --> 2848.76]  which is at the end of the Gulf of Aqaba on the Israel side.
[2848.90 --> 2853.32]  It's traditionally part of what would have been considered the northern Sinai region.
[2853.42 --> 2854.72]  I think there's a picture.
[2854.90 --> 2856.70]  If we put that first picture up,
[2856.70 --> 2862.12]  On the top right, you can see a bit of a map there.
[2862.60 --> 2869.22]  The Sinai Peninsula is what comes down between the Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of Aqaba on one side.
[2869.22 --> 2874.64]  And then right across the northern part of the Sinai Peninsula, there's a road.
[2875.06 --> 2880.32]  Kind of where that road hits the eastern side there, that's where the Timna National Park is.
[2880.32 --> 2886.76]  We had the opportunity as a group to travel and to visit Timna National Park.
[2886.86 --> 2896.70]  Now, the day that we got to this region, it was 45 degrees Celsius at 9 o'clock in the morning.
[2899.08 --> 2904.98]  And we got off our bus, we put our packs on, and we started hiking through the desert.
[2904.98 --> 2911.96]  And we walked for about half an hour, and then George, who was our group leader and teacher,
[2912.12 --> 2916.60]  he said, okay, stop, take your backpacks off, put them on the ground.
[2917.40 --> 2923.74]  And we stood there for a few minutes, and he said, okay, put your backpack on and keep hiking.
[2924.14 --> 2927.56]  And so then we walked for another little while, and they said, okay, now stop,
[2927.56 --> 2935.44]  take your backpack off, put it on the ground, okay, put it on and keep walking.
[2935.58 --> 2941.54]  And we continued to do that over and over again, and it continued to get hotter and hotter.
[2941.64 --> 2945.18]  I'm pretty sure on that day, I drank four liters of water before noon.
[2946.08 --> 2947.26]  That's how hot it was.
[2947.56 --> 2954.70]  Actually, the couple days after, more than like 80% of our group got heat stroke and was down and out
[2954.70 --> 2958.20]  because of that particular day and that morning.
[2958.90 --> 2965.58]  About 30 minutes into our first hike, when George asked us to stop one more time and to put our bags down,
[2965.92 --> 2970.28]  someone from the back of the group, there was about 45 of us, said, why are we doing this?
[2971.56 --> 2972.86]  And George said, right there.
[2974.48 --> 2975.14]  Right there.
[2975.22 --> 2980.50]  It took you half an hour before you started to grumble and complain.
[2981.70 --> 2983.70]  The Israelites did this for 40 years.
[2984.70 --> 2992.24]  This is relatively the same region and the same circumstance and the same temperature
[2992.24 --> 2997.28]  that the Israelites would have had to deal with as they wandered through that region.
[2997.38 --> 2998.96]  You see the image behind me.
[2999.08 --> 3008.56]  That's the desert of the northern Sinai Peninsula, the southern region of Judea or the Negev or the Desert of Sin,
[3008.64 --> 3010.32]  if you move further to the west.
[3010.40 --> 3012.64]  You will hear these place names as we go through.
[3012.64 --> 3020.76]  We were a group of sanctified pastors and our more sanctified spouses,
[3021.18 --> 3025.00]  and it took us 30 minutes before we started complaining.
[3026.02 --> 3029.16]  That experience changed the way I read this story.
[3030.82 --> 3035.20]  So I want to share that with you as we jump into this text.
[3035.20 --> 3040.94]  I'm going to read starting at verse 1, and then we'll stop at verse 18.
[3040.94 --> 3050.40]  The whole Israelite community set out from Elim and came to the Desert of Sin,
[3050.74 --> 3057.08]  which is between Elim and Sinai, on the 15th day of the second month after they had come out of Egypt.
[3057.80 --> 3062.36]  In the desert, the whole community grumbled against Moses and Aaron.
[3062.36 --> 3065.12]  And the Israelites said to them,
[3066.12 --> 3068.90]  If only we had died by the Lord's hand in Egypt.
[3069.58 --> 3073.18]  There we sat around pots of meat and ate all the food we wanted,
[3073.46 --> 3078.64]  but you have brought us out into this desert to starve this entire assembly to death.
[3080.10 --> 3082.98]  Then the Lord said to Moses,
[3082.98 --> 3109.20]  So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites,
[3109.20 --> 3123.80]  Who are we that you should grumble against us?
[3124.50 --> 3125.50]  Moses also said,
[3125.50 --> 3129.66]  You will know that it was the Lord when he gives you meat in the evening
[3129.66 --> 3132.12]  and all the bread you want in the morning,
[3132.54 --> 3135.10]  because he has heard your grumbling against him.
[3135.74 --> 3136.68]  Who are we?
[3136.68 --> 3139.80]  You are not grumbling against us, but against the Lord.
[3141.04 --> 3143.26]  Then Moses told Aaron,
[3144.20 --> 3146.44]  Say to the entire Israelite community,
[3146.94 --> 3150.66]  Come before the Lord, for he has heard your grumbling.
[3152.20 --> 3155.26]  Now while Aaron was speaking to the whole Israelite community,
[3155.44 --> 3156.76]  they looked toward the desert,
[3157.22 --> 3160.82]  and there was the glory of the Lord appearing in a cloud.
[3161.90 --> 3163.32]  The Lord said to Moses,
[3163.32 --> 3165.74]  I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites.
[3166.30 --> 3166.78]  Tell them,
[3166.96 --> 3168.50]  At twilight you will eat meat,
[3168.56 --> 3170.38]  and in the morning you will be filled with bread,
[3170.52 --> 3174.74]  and then you will know that I am the Lord your God.
[3176.22 --> 3179.08]  That evening quail came and covered the camp.
[3179.92 --> 3182.64]  And in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp,
[3182.68 --> 3183.94]  and when the dew was gone,
[3184.14 --> 3188.06]  thin flakes like frost on the ground appeared on the desert floor.
[3188.06 --> 3190.66]  When the Israelites saw it,
[3190.82 --> 3191.82]  they said to each other,
[3192.28 --> 3192.86]  What is it?
[3193.50 --> 3194.92]  For they did not know what it was.
[3196.44 --> 3197.66]  Moses said to them,
[3198.12 --> 3200.62]  It is the bread the Lord has given you to eat.
[3201.26 --> 3202.88]  This is what the Lord has commanded.
[3203.32 --> 3205.60]  Everyone is to gather as much as they need.
[3206.00 --> 3209.30]  Take an omer for each person you have in your tent.
[3209.30 --> 3212.58]  The Israelites did as they were told.
[3213.10 --> 3213.98]  Some gathered much,
[3214.24 --> 3215.40]  some gathered little.
[3215.88 --> 3217.62]  And when they measured it by the omer,
[3217.92 --> 3220.14]  the one who gathered much did not have too much,
[3220.20 --> 3222.72]  and the one who gathered little did not have too little.
[3223.30 --> 3227.20]  Everyone had gathered just as much as they needed.
[3228.02 --> 3229.10]  This is the word of the Lord.
[3232.68 --> 3233.20]  Now,
[3233.42 --> 3237.30]  to get you into the mind space of this story,
[3237.30 --> 3241.22]  I don't want you to miss the timing of this event.
[3241.62 --> 3241.80]  Okay?
[3241.88 --> 3243.70]  In the very first verse.
[3244.72 --> 3249.94]  On the 15th day of the second month after they had come out of Egypt.
[3250.54 --> 3251.02]  Now,
[3251.04 --> 3252.50]  who remembers when they came out of Egypt?
[3253.36 --> 3253.88]  Right?
[3253.94 --> 3257.60]  That was the 15th day of the first month.
[3258.30 --> 3262.46]  You can go back to chapter 12 in the story of the Passover and read the details.
[3262.68 --> 3265.90]  But what that means is that it's only been a month
[3265.90 --> 3268.00]  since leaving Egypt.
[3268.68 --> 3269.38]  That's it.
[3269.92 --> 3271.72]  Just one month.
[3272.56 --> 3273.12]  Now,
[3273.16 --> 3276.96]  this story that we read here is part of a larger section
[3276.96 --> 3280.48]  that tells of God's provisions for the people
[3280.48 --> 3284.30]  during this first part of the wilderness wandering.
[3284.30 --> 3287.80]  And it leads up to the giving of the law at Mount Sinai.
[3288.48 --> 3288.66]  Now,
[3288.70 --> 3291.92]  there are two stories in this section on the provision of water,
[3291.92 --> 3296.12]  and then our story on the provision of bread and meat for the people.
[3296.82 --> 3298.30]  You can see if your Bibles are open,
[3298.38 --> 3299.74]  the end of chapter 15,
[3300.16 --> 3302.16]  bitter water is made drinkable
[3302.16 --> 3304.58]  because Moses throws a piece of wood into it.
[3304.70 --> 3305.98]  And then chapter 17,
[3306.58 --> 3307.90]  water comes out of a rock
[3307.90 --> 3310.10]  because Moses hits it with his staff.
[3311.04 --> 3311.88]  These stories,
[3312.14 --> 3312.72]  all of them,
[3312.80 --> 3315.74]  are connected by two things.
[3316.38 --> 3317.52]  In the first place,
[3317.52 --> 3320.44]  they're connected by the people grumbling against God
[3320.44 --> 3321.36]  and against Moses.
[3322.24 --> 3323.66]  And then in the second place,
[3323.80 --> 3326.32]  they are connected by God providing for them
[3326.32 --> 3327.72]  again and again
[3327.72 --> 3330.08]  in spite of that grumbling.
[3331.44 --> 3332.00]  Now,
[3332.08 --> 3334.22]  in the story of the Sea of Reeds,
[3334.30 --> 3335.66]  which we just looked at,
[3336.00 --> 3337.86]  we saw a people who grumbled
[3337.86 --> 3338.80]  and who complained
[3338.80 --> 3341.66]  because they judged their own circumstances
[3341.66 --> 3345.18]  as the standard on which to base reality.
[3345.18 --> 3347.30]  And in the Sea of Reeds,
[3347.40 --> 3348.24]  the Red Sea story,
[3348.36 --> 3349.54]  God reminded them
[3349.54 --> 3352.20]  that it is his action in history
[3352.20 --> 3353.62]  that is the true standard.
[3354.76 --> 3355.60]  And that story,
[3355.90 --> 3356.72]  chapter 14,
[3357.22 --> 3358.40]  ends by saying
[3358.40 --> 3360.64]  that the people feared the Lord
[3360.64 --> 3362.04]  and put their trust in him
[3362.04 --> 3363.28]  and Moses their servant.
[3364.38 --> 3364.92]  And now,
[3365.92 --> 3367.08]  not even one month later,
[3367.86 --> 3369.32]  they're back to their old ways.
[3370.52 --> 3370.98]  Right?
[3371.02 --> 3372.40]  They haven't really learned yet
[3372.40 --> 3374.56]  that even though there's no water or no food,
[3374.56 --> 3376.54]  God is above those circumstances.
[3377.48 --> 3378.06]  And so,
[3378.38 --> 3379.14]  they grumble
[3379.14 --> 3380.84]  and complain.
[3382.30 --> 3384.22]  And what's amazing about this text,
[3384.28 --> 3385.78]  and we're going to return to this more fully
[3385.78 --> 3387.34]  near the end of our time,
[3387.60 --> 3389.80]  is that God uses their grumbling
[3389.80 --> 3390.80]  and their complaining
[3390.80 --> 3392.06]  as the occasion
[3392.06 --> 3395.10]  to reveal himself in grace
[3395.10 --> 3397.64]  and not to punish them.
[3399.40 --> 3399.88]  Right?
[3399.90 --> 3400.44]  It's hot.
[3401.16 --> 3402.32]  There's no food.
[3402.70 --> 3404.12]  There's little to no water.
[3404.12 --> 3405.74]  They didn't have camel packs
[3405.74 --> 3407.32]  that carried two liters of water
[3407.32 --> 3407.98]  with the opportunity
[3407.98 --> 3409.56]  to go refill it on the tourist bus
[3409.56 --> 3410.42]  halfway through the day.
[3411.54 --> 3412.00]  Right?
[3412.04 --> 3413.14]  It's not surprising
[3413.14 --> 3414.26]  that they complained.
[3415.08 --> 3415.20]  Right?
[3415.22 --> 3416.42]  That's what changed for me
[3416.42 --> 3417.70]  as I walked in the desert
[3417.70 --> 3419.22]  in that 45 degree heat.
[3419.70 --> 3422.36]  I went into that day
[3422.36 --> 3422.78]  thinking,
[3423.00 --> 3424.20]  how could they complain?
[3424.32 --> 3426.22]  How could they prefer slavery
[3426.22 --> 3427.94]  in Egypt
[3427.94 --> 3429.68]  over freedom
[3429.68 --> 3430.82]  in some hot weather?
[3431.82 --> 3432.76]  And then I did it.
[3432.76 --> 3435.66]  And I had a little bit more empathy
[3435.66 --> 3436.90]  in that moment.
[3438.74 --> 3440.60]  Now maybe when you read this story,
[3440.72 --> 3441.34]  you do the same.
[3441.46 --> 3442.94]  You jump to judgment.
[3443.10 --> 3443.24]  Right?
[3443.28 --> 3444.66]  How on earth can they prefer
[3444.66 --> 3446.26]  slavery and a full belly
[3446.26 --> 3447.32]  over freedom
[3447.32 --> 3448.26]  and a little bit of hunger?
[3449.32 --> 3451.28]  But I want you to really think about that
[3451.28 --> 3452.38]  this morning.
[3452.76 --> 3452.96]  Right?
[3452.96 --> 3455.46]  Because it's really easy for us
[3455.46 --> 3456.88]  to suppose
[3456.88 --> 3457.58]  that the,
[3457.68 --> 3458.38]  what's the say,
[3458.44 --> 3459.60]  that the grass is greener
[3459.60 --> 3460.52]  on the other side.
[3461.42 --> 3461.64]  Right?
[3461.70 --> 3463.32]  It's easier for some of us
[3463.32 --> 3463.98]  to think that
[3463.98 --> 3465.54]  things were so much better
[3465.54 --> 3466.68]  in the good old days.
[3468.68 --> 3469.12]  Right?
[3469.12 --> 3469.72]  How many of us
[3469.72 --> 3471.34]  have faced hard times
[3471.34 --> 3473.62]  and then shouted out
[3473.62 --> 3474.30]  to God
[3474.30 --> 3475.64]  at the unfairness of it all?
[3476.44 --> 3477.38]  How many times
[3477.38 --> 3478.50]  have you been in a situation
[3478.50 --> 3479.72]  where it just didn't seem
[3479.72 --> 3480.40]  to make sense?
[3480.40 --> 3481.22]  it didn't seem
[3481.22 --> 3482.04]  to have a purpose.
[3485.32 --> 3485.76]  Maybe
[3485.76 --> 3489.60]  the cancer diagnosis
[3489.60 --> 3491.12]  has come back
[3491.12 --> 3493.98]  and we cry out,
[3494.34 --> 3494.56]  well,
[3495.84 --> 3496.84]  you're just going to
[3496.84 --> 3497.58]  leave me to die,
[3497.90 --> 3498.20]  God?
[3500.12 --> 3500.56]  Maybe,
[3500.90 --> 3502.26]  I mean it's February
[3502.26 --> 3503.46]  and the end of February
[3503.46 --> 3503.98]  so maybe
[3503.98 --> 3505.86]  depression came back
[3505.86 --> 3506.54]  with a vengeance
[3506.54 --> 3507.68]  and you feel
[3507.68 --> 3508.46]  so alone
[3508.46 --> 3510.06]  and if God
[3510.06 --> 3511.06]  really loved me
[3511.06 --> 3512.14]  he wouldn't let me
[3512.14 --> 3512.86]  feel this way.
[3514.70 --> 3514.82]  Right?
[3514.86 --> 3515.88]  Some of us have known
[3515.88 --> 3517.04]  and experienced
[3517.04 --> 3518.58]  the blessing of God
[3518.58 --> 3519.94]  our entire lives.
[3520.02 --> 3520.90]  We can't think back
[3520.90 --> 3521.34]  on a moment
[3521.34 --> 3522.08]  where God hasn't
[3522.08 --> 3523.32]  richly blessed us
[3523.32 --> 3523.88]  and then
[3523.88 --> 3524.64]  when we face
[3524.64 --> 3525.32]  one trial
[3525.32 --> 3526.40]  or one hardship
[3526.40 --> 3527.24]  all of that
[3527.24 --> 3528.28]  becomes meaningless.
[3531.70 --> 3532.80]  When we are not
[3532.80 --> 3533.68]  in a situation
[3533.68 --> 3534.62]  when
[3534.62 --> 3537.00]  where the cupboards
[3537.00 --> 3537.68]  are full
[3537.68 --> 3538.82]  or retirement
[3538.82 --> 3540.08]  is secure
[3540.08 --> 3540.62]  right?
[3540.66 --> 3541.42]  It's easy
[3541.42 --> 3542.16]  to suppose
[3542.16 --> 3543.44]  that only
[3543.44 --> 3543.98]  the most
[3543.98 --> 3544.96]  hard-hearted
[3544.96 --> 3545.68]  stubborn
[3545.68 --> 3546.54]  or callous
[3546.54 --> 3547.20]  people
[3547.20 --> 3548.00]  would grumble
[3548.00 --> 3548.70]  and complain
[3548.70 --> 3549.66]  against God
[3549.66 --> 3550.84]  and yet
[3550.84 --> 3553.36]  when the cost
[3553.36 --> 3553.78]  of living
[3553.78 --> 3554.78]  keeps going up
[3554.78 --> 3556.18]  seemingly exponentially
[3556.18 --> 3557.22]  right?
[3557.24 --> 3557.68]  When the price
[3557.68 --> 3558.18]  of fuel
[3558.18 --> 3559.14]  and hydro
[3559.14 --> 3560.18]  and natural gas
[3560.18 --> 3561.44]  just keeps rising
[3561.44 --> 3562.68]  when the dream
[3562.68 --> 3563.84]  of owning a home
[3563.84 --> 3564.48]  for some of you
[3564.48 --> 3565.32]  is just that
[3565.32 --> 3565.88]  a dream
[3565.88 --> 3566.84]  that never seems
[3566.84 --> 3567.22]  like it will
[3567.22 --> 3567.78]  become real
[3567.78 --> 3569.16]  right?
[3569.20 --> 3569.66]  When you're living
[3569.66 --> 3570.24]  paycheck
[3570.24 --> 3571.10]  to paycheck
[3571.10 --> 3571.88]  to paycheck
[3571.88 --> 3572.94]  with no end
[3572.94 --> 3573.66]  to the struggle
[3573.66 --> 3574.24]  in sight
[3574.24 --> 3574.96]  it becomes
[3574.96 --> 3576.00]  really easy
[3576.00 --> 3576.54]  does it not
[3576.54 --> 3577.18]  to be bitter
[3577.18 --> 3578.46]  and to blame
[3578.46 --> 3578.86]  God
[3578.86 --> 3579.40]  or to blame
[3579.40 --> 3579.94]  the government
[3579.94 --> 3581.16]  or to grumble
[3581.16 --> 3582.44]  and complain.
[3584.50 --> 3585.48]  The challenge
[3585.48 --> 3586.50]  that Israel
[3586.50 --> 3587.92]  still had to learn
[3587.92 --> 3588.48]  and the challenge
[3588.48 --> 3589.66]  that we are
[3589.66 --> 3590.60]  here to learn
[3590.60 --> 3591.44]  again and again
[3591.44 --> 3592.50]  is that God
[3592.50 --> 3594.20]  based on the evidence
[3594.20 --> 3595.08]  of his past
[3595.08 --> 3595.86]  action
[3595.86 --> 3597.26]  is most
[3597.26 --> 3598.06]  trustworthy
[3598.06 --> 3600.12]  and if you let him
[3600.12 --> 3601.24]  he will provide
[3601.24 --> 3602.66]  but here's where
[3602.66 --> 3603.58]  it gets really hard
[3603.58 --> 3604.74]  and here's where
[3604.74 --> 3605.16]  some of you
[3605.16 --> 3605.54]  are going to get
[3605.54 --> 3605.90]  mad at me
[3605.90 --> 3606.34]  this morning
[3606.34 --> 3608.50]  because if God
[3608.50 --> 3609.42]  doesn't provide
[3609.42 --> 3611.62]  it's either
[3611.62 --> 3613.16]  because he knows
[3613.16 --> 3614.10]  you don't need it
[3614.10 --> 3616.04]  or because he
[3616.04 --> 3617.12]  wants you to know
[3617.12 --> 3618.16]  that you need him
[3618.16 --> 3618.60]  more
[3618.60 --> 3620.18]  than whatever
[3620.18 --> 3620.92]  that thing is.
[3622.50 --> 3623.32]  Because yes
[3623.32 --> 3624.20]  life in Egypt
[3624.20 --> 3624.84]  was hard
[3624.84 --> 3625.82]  right?
[3625.88 --> 3626.76]  Life in the desert
[3626.76 --> 3627.54]  was probably
[3627.54 --> 3628.86]  still harder
[3628.86 --> 3629.90]  right?
[3629.92 --> 3630.60]  We can understand
[3630.60 --> 3631.14]  that it's not
[3631.14 --> 3632.18]  an easy place
[3632.18 --> 3632.60]  to live
[3632.60 --> 3633.48]  and this is made
[3633.48 --> 3634.20]  more difficult
[3634.20 --> 3634.72]  by the fact
[3634.72 --> 3635.64]  that there was
[3635.64 --> 3637.20]  two million plus
[3637.20 --> 3638.22]  maybe people
[3638.22 --> 3639.36]  in this moment
[3639.36 --> 3639.64]  right?
[3639.68 --> 3640.52]  And the only way
[3640.52 --> 3641.28]  that that kind
[3641.28 --> 3642.42]  of people group
[3642.42 --> 3644.10]  are able to survive
[3644.10 --> 3645.02]  in that moment
[3645.02 --> 3646.12]  is if they trust
[3646.12 --> 3647.24]  God completely
[3647.24 --> 3648.48]  right?
[3648.60 --> 3649.84]  All pretense
[3649.84 --> 3651.62]  at self-sufficiency
[3651.62 --> 3653.06]  at individual
[3653.06 --> 3653.78]  autonomy
[3653.78 --> 3654.24]  or even
[3654.24 --> 3654.90]  community
[3654.90 --> 3655.58]  autonomy
[3655.58 --> 3656.26]  has to be
[3656.26 --> 3656.66]  discarded
[3656.66 --> 3657.48]  has to be
[3657.48 --> 3658.02]  cast off
[3658.02 --> 3659.04]  the Bible
[3659.04 --> 3660.04]  clearly shows
[3660.04 --> 3661.02]  over and over
[3661.02 --> 3661.80]  and over again
[3661.80 --> 3662.22]  and we know
[3662.22 --> 3662.92]  this from our
[3662.92 --> 3663.64]  own experience
[3663.64 --> 3663.88]  right?
[3664.18 --> 3664.72]  That total
[3664.72 --> 3665.38]  trust and
[3665.38 --> 3665.76]  obedience
[3665.76 --> 3666.30]  in those
[3666.30 --> 3666.62]  moments
[3666.62 --> 3668.40]  really hard
[3668.40 --> 3669.36]  and it's
[3669.36 --> 3670.02]  really rare
[3670.02 --> 3670.70]  for even
[3670.70 --> 3671.08]  the most
[3671.08 --> 3671.56]  godly
[3671.56 --> 3672.44]  person
[3672.44 --> 3675.10]  now
[3675.10 --> 3677.42]  as we dig
[3677.42 --> 3678.02]  into this
[3678.02 --> 3678.40]  I want to
[3678.40 --> 3679.50]  make a
[3679.50 --> 3679.88]  clarification
[3679.88 --> 3680.42]  here
[3680.42 --> 3680.72]  because
[3680.72 --> 3681.34]  it's
[3681.34 --> 3681.84]  important
[3681.84 --> 3682.68]  to see
[3682.68 --> 3682.96]  that
[3682.96 --> 3684.08]  complaint
[3684.08 --> 3685.02]  right?
[3685.08 --> 3685.54]  Is not
[3685.54 --> 3686.36]  always a
[3686.36 --> 3687.12]  bad thing
[3687.12 --> 3687.74]  in the
[3687.74 --> 3688.04]  Bible
[3688.04 --> 3689.20]  right?
[3689.24 --> 3689.54]  There's a
[3689.54 --> 3690.84]  whole genre
[3690.84 --> 3692.78]  of psalms
[3692.78 --> 3693.86]  the worship
[3693.86 --> 3694.84]  book of Israel
[3694.84 --> 3695.42]  that are
[3695.42 --> 3696.04]  complaints
[3696.04 --> 3696.62]  against
[3696.62 --> 3697.52]  God
[3697.52 --> 3697.96]  right?
[3697.96 --> 3698.52]  Complaints
[3698.52 --> 3699.14]  against God
[3699.14 --> 3699.96]  for abandoning
[3699.96 --> 3700.68]  them apparently
[3700.68 --> 3701.42]  or complaints
[3701.42 --> 3701.98]  against God
[3701.98 --> 3702.46]  for the
[3702.46 --> 3702.88]  enemy
[3702.88 --> 3704.12]  of Israel
[3704.12 --> 3704.60]  to be
[3704.60 --> 3705.02]  winning
[3705.02 --> 3705.50]  or getting
[3705.50 --> 3705.96]  its way
[3705.96 --> 3706.50]  complaints
[3706.50 --> 3707.22]  against God
[3707.22 --> 3707.94]  for him
[3707.94 --> 3708.70]  not seeming
[3708.70 --> 3709.00]  to be
[3709.00 --> 3709.30]  faithful
[3709.30 --> 3709.68]  to his
[3709.68 --> 3709.98]  covenant
[3709.98 --> 3710.92]  provinces
[3710.92 --> 3713.44]  but there's
[3713.44 --> 3714.10]  a difference
[3714.10 --> 3715.92]  because as
[3715.92 --> 3716.62]  the psalmist
[3716.62 --> 3717.38]  cries out
[3717.38 --> 3718.06]  to God
[3718.06 --> 3719.14]  in complaints
[3719.14 --> 3719.62]  or in
[3719.62 --> 3720.30]  lament
[3720.30 --> 3721.12]  he does
[3721.12 --> 3722.12]  so because
[3722.12 --> 3722.88]  of his
[3722.88 --> 3723.66]  faith that
[3723.66 --> 3724.28]  God is
[3724.28 --> 3725.08]  still there
[3725.08 --> 3725.76]  to hear
[3725.76 --> 3726.60]  that complaint
[3726.60 --> 3728.00]  right?
[3728.06 --> 3728.60]  He knows
[3728.60 --> 3729.04]  in his
[3729.04 --> 3729.44]  heart
[3729.44 --> 3730.38]  that God
[3730.38 --> 3731.24]  is present
[3731.24 --> 3731.96]  even if
[3731.96 --> 3732.44]  he can't
[3732.44 --> 3733.00]  see him
[3733.00 --> 3733.62]  in his
[3733.62 --> 3733.98]  life
[3733.98 --> 3735.26]  the
[3735.26 --> 3735.78]  complaining
[3735.78 --> 3736.42]  that Israel
[3736.42 --> 3737.04]  is doing
[3737.04 --> 3737.58]  here
[3737.58 --> 3738.54]  is of a
[3738.54 --> 3738.80]  different
[3738.80 --> 3739.44]  category
[3739.44 --> 3740.76]  right?
[3740.82 --> 3741.38]  The complaining
[3741.38 --> 3742.38]  here is not
[3742.38 --> 3743.26]  to God
[3743.26 --> 3745.06]  but against
[3745.06 --> 3746.24]  God
[3746.24 --> 3747.60]  right?
[3747.64 --> 3747.92]  If the
[3747.92 --> 3748.30]  psalmist
[3748.30 --> 3749.02]  complains
[3749.02 --> 3750.10]  because she
[3750.10 --> 3751.02]  has faith
[3751.02 --> 3752.70]  the Israelites
[3752.70 --> 3753.54]  complain
[3753.54 --> 3754.78]  because of a
[3754.78 --> 3755.38]  lack of
[3755.38 --> 3755.66]  faith
[3755.66 --> 3757.50]  right?
[3757.50 --> 3758.00]  At the first
[3758.00 --> 3758.54]  sign of
[3758.54 --> 3758.92]  trouble
[3758.92 --> 3759.98]  or difficulty
[3759.98 --> 3760.56]  the people
[3760.56 --> 3761.52]  resort back
[3761.52 --> 3762.26]  into their
[3762.26 --> 3763.06]  default
[3763.06 --> 3763.78]  self-centered
[3763.78 --> 3764.40]  way of
[3764.40 --> 3764.92]  viewing the
[3764.92 --> 3765.22]  world
[3765.22 --> 3765.54]  and they
[3765.54 --> 3766.08]  turn from
[3766.08 --> 3766.40]  God
[3766.40 --> 3767.04]  because he
[3767.04 --> 3767.70]  has forgotten
[3767.70 --> 3768.26]  them or
[3768.26 --> 3768.98]  been unfair
[3768.98 --> 3769.44]  to them
[3769.44 --> 3771.68]  and that's
[3771.68 --> 3772.24]  important for
[3772.24 --> 3772.98]  us to see
[3772.98 --> 3773.78]  and to hear
[3773.78 --> 3774.14]  because there's
[3774.14 --> 3775.32]  a principle
[3775.32 --> 3776.76]  underneath it
[3776.76 --> 3777.94]  right?
[3778.02 --> 3779.06]  When you
[3779.06 --> 3779.82]  yourselves
[3779.82 --> 3781.50]  are grumbling
[3781.50 --> 3783.38]  or complaining
[3783.38 --> 3785.30]  whether to
[3785.30 --> 3785.78]  God or
[3785.78 --> 3786.44]  about God
[3786.44 --> 3786.80]  or to
[3786.80 --> 3787.40]  other people
[3787.40 --> 3788.28]  about other
[3788.28 --> 3788.72]  people
[3788.72 --> 3789.94]  ask yourself
[3789.94 --> 3790.34]  this
[3790.34 --> 3791.30]  am I
[3791.30 --> 3791.80]  grumbling
[3791.80 --> 3792.50]  right now
[3792.50 --> 3793.20]  because I'm
[3793.20 --> 3794.10]  being self-centered?
[3794.90 --> 3795.80]  Is my
[3795.80 --> 3796.68]  selfishness
[3796.68 --> 3797.38]  dictating
[3797.38 --> 3798.30]  my emotions
[3798.30 --> 3798.94]  or the
[3798.94 --> 3799.38]  perspective
[3799.38 --> 3799.92]  of my
[3799.92 --> 3800.50]  situation
[3800.50 --> 3801.32]  right now?
[3802.04 --> 3802.82]  Ask yourself
[3802.82 --> 3803.46]  am I
[3803.46 --> 3804.24]  lamenting
[3804.24 --> 3804.66]  right?
[3804.74 --> 3805.40]  The lamenting
[3805.40 --> 3805.82]  is the
[3805.82 --> 3806.62]  legitimate
[3806.62 --> 3807.44]  crying out
[3807.44 --> 3807.88]  to God
[3807.88 --> 3808.68]  for justice
[3808.68 --> 3809.32]  and his
[3809.32 --> 3809.72]  presence
[3809.72 --> 3810.08]  to be
[3810.08 --> 3810.56]  restored
[3810.56 --> 3811.16]  because of
[3811.16 --> 3811.66]  my faith
[3811.66 --> 3812.18]  in him
[3812.18 --> 3813.06]  or
[3813.06 --> 3815.00]  are you
[3815.00 --> 3815.34]  grumbling
[3815.34 --> 3816.12]  and complaining
[3816.12 --> 3816.66]  because of
[3816.66 --> 3817.06]  a lack
[3817.06 --> 3817.60]  of faith
[3817.60 --> 3818.24]  in your
[3818.24 --> 3818.70]  life right
[3818.70 --> 3818.92]  now?
[3819.92 --> 3820.76]  And if it's
[3820.76 --> 3821.24]  the latter
[3821.24 --> 3822.74]  what would
[3822.74 --> 3823.44]  it look like
[3823.44 --> 3824.28]  to pursue
[3824.28 --> 3825.44]  faith in
[3825.44 --> 3826.90]  that moment?
[3829.10 --> 3829.38]  Let me
[3829.38 --> 3829.82]  just say
[3829.82 --> 3831.92]  we are
[3831.92 --> 3832.40]  all
[3832.40 --> 3833.14]  myself
[3833.14 --> 3833.64]  included
[3833.64 --> 3834.56]  we are
[3834.56 --> 3835.50]  all really
[3835.50 --> 3836.34]  susceptible
[3836.34 --> 3837.82]  to self-centered
[3837.82 --> 3838.48]  complaining
[3838.48 --> 3839.30]  right now
[3841.16 --> 3842.04]  this is the
[3842.04 --> 3842.58]  culture we
[3842.58 --> 3843.16]  live in
[3843.16 --> 3845.38]  but as
[3845.38 --> 3846.06]  Christians
[3846.06 --> 3847.72]  as disciples
[3847.72 --> 3848.22]  of Jesus
[3848.22 --> 3849.08]  as followers
[3849.08 --> 3849.46]  of God
[3849.46 --> 3850.12]  we need to
[3850.12 --> 3850.98]  be different
[3850.98 --> 3851.78]  in that
[3851.78 --> 3854.84]  think prayerfully
[3854.84 --> 3856.20]  about that
[3856.20 --> 3857.22]  this week
[3857.22 --> 3859.96]  now
[3859.96 --> 3862.42]  we continue
[3862.42 --> 3863.10]  the story
[3863.10 --> 3864.10]  of Israel's
[3864.10 --> 3864.80]  grumbling
[3864.80 --> 3865.74]  through the
[3865.74 --> 3866.18]  book of
[3866.18 --> 3866.58]  numbers
[3866.58 --> 3868.34]  this grumbling
[3868.34 --> 3869.12]  people
[3869.12 --> 3870.20]  will eventually
[3870.20 --> 3871.34]  come to a
[3871.34 --> 3871.82]  head with
[3871.82 --> 3872.18]  God
[3872.18 --> 3872.72]  and God
[3872.72 --> 3873.50]  will in
[3873.50 --> 3874.30]  fact punish
[3874.30 --> 3874.74]  the people
[3874.74 --> 3875.34]  by saying
[3875.34 --> 3876.42]  that those
[3876.42 --> 3877.20]  of them
[3877.20 --> 3877.58]  who are
[3877.58 --> 3878.32]  20 years
[3878.32 --> 3878.94]  or older
[3878.94 --> 3879.44]  will not
[3879.44 --> 3879.90]  enter the
[3879.90 --> 3880.52]  promised land
[3880.52 --> 3881.78]  right
[3881.78 --> 3882.26]  the term
[3882.26 --> 3883.18]  of Israel's
[3883.18 --> 3883.58]  wandering
[3883.58 --> 3884.20]  as being
[3884.20 --> 3885.24]  40 years
[3885.24 --> 3885.62]  in the
[3885.62 --> 3885.92]  wilderness
[3885.92 --> 3886.70]  is determined
[3886.70 --> 3887.76]  by the
[3887.76 --> 3888.28]  death of
[3888.28 --> 3888.76]  the last
[3888.76 --> 3889.42]  person of
[3889.42 --> 3889.66]  this
[3889.66 --> 3890.24]  generation
[3890.24 --> 3891.32]  you can
[3891.32 --> 3891.66]  read that
[3891.66 --> 3892.06]  in the
[3892.06 --> 3892.30]  book of
[3892.30 --> 3892.58]  numbers
[3892.58 --> 3894.32]  and so
[3894.32 --> 3894.92]  while punishment
[3894.92 --> 3896.26]  is coming
[3896.26 --> 3897.00]  for these
[3897.00 --> 3897.80]  people in
[3897.80 --> 3898.34]  their grumbling
[3898.34 --> 3899.26]  what's amazing
[3899.26 --> 3900.14]  about this
[3900.14 --> 3900.78]  story
[3900.78 --> 3901.74]  right here
[3901.74 --> 3902.50]  is not so
[3902.50 --> 3903.02]  much that the
[3903.02 --> 3903.66]  people grumbled
[3903.66 --> 3904.18]  because we
[3904.18 --> 3904.58]  get that
[3904.58 --> 3906.28]  right that's
[3906.28 --> 3906.82]  pretty common
[3906.82 --> 3907.92]  what is
[3907.92 --> 3908.62]  significant
[3908.62 --> 3910.44]  is how
[3910.44 --> 3911.82]  God responds
[3911.82 --> 3912.72]  in this
[3912.72 --> 3913.08]  moment
[3913.08 --> 3914.20]  right rather
[3914.20 --> 3914.94]  than punish
[3914.94 --> 3915.60]  the people
[3915.60 --> 3916.80]  he literally
[3916.80 --> 3918.00]  rains down
[3918.00 --> 3918.72]  bread from
[3918.72 --> 3919.08]  heaven
[3919.08 --> 3920.62]  rather than
[3920.62 --> 3921.52]  treat them
[3921.52 --> 3922.34]  as he is
[3922.34 --> 3923.00]  being treated
[3923.00 --> 3923.96]  he provides
[3923.96 --> 3924.38]  for them
[3924.38 --> 3925.16]  and he does
[3925.16 --> 3925.82]  so without
[3925.82 --> 3926.94]  even a hint
[3926.94 --> 3927.76]  of anger
[3927.76 --> 3929.04]  or malice
[3929.04 --> 3929.66]  right he
[3929.66 --> 3930.42]  provides
[3930.42 --> 3931.12]  for his
[3931.12 --> 3931.48]  people
[3931.48 --> 3933.78]  we read
[3933.78 --> 3934.12]  that in
[3934.12 --> 3934.80]  the evening
[3934.80 --> 3936.58]  quail came
[3936.58 --> 3937.14]  and covered
[3937.14 --> 3937.60]  the camp
[3937.60 --> 3938.30]  and in the
[3938.30 --> 3938.84]  morning there
[3938.84 --> 3939.28]  was a layer
[3939.28 --> 3939.82]  of dew
[3939.82 --> 3940.66]  around the
[3940.66 --> 3940.98]  camp and
[3940.98 --> 3941.24]  when the
[3941.24 --> 3941.68]  dew was
[3941.68 --> 3942.28]  gone thin
[3942.28 --> 3942.86]  flakes of
[3942.86 --> 3943.38]  frost on
[3943.38 --> 3943.76]  the ground
[3943.76 --> 3944.86]  appeared on
[3944.86 --> 3945.22]  the desert
[3945.22 --> 3946.36]  floor when
[3946.36 --> 3946.78]  the Israelites
[3946.78 --> 3948.18]  saw it they
[3948.18 --> 3948.76]  said to each
[3948.76 --> 3949.64]  other what
[3949.64 --> 3950.00]  is it
[3950.00 --> 3951.82]  in verse 31
[3951.82 --> 3952.56]  of this
[3952.56 --> 3953.32]  chapter which
[3953.32 --> 3953.66]  we didn't
[3953.66 --> 3954.52]  read we're
[3954.52 --> 3955.14]  told that the
[3955.14 --> 3956.02]  people called
[3956.02 --> 3956.58]  the bread
[3956.58 --> 3957.44]  manna
[3957.44 --> 3959.10]  it's a word
[3959.10 --> 3960.02]  play in the
[3960.02 --> 3960.90]  Hebrew based
[3960.90 --> 3961.72]  on the question
[3961.72 --> 3962.74]  what is it
[3962.74 --> 3963.72]  right they
[3963.72 --> 3964.92]  literally called
[3964.92 --> 3965.72]  this thing
[3965.72 --> 3966.48]  what's it
[3966.48 --> 3968.18]  and that's
[3968.18 --> 3968.40]  what they
[3968.40 --> 3968.64]  ate
[3968.64 --> 3970.04]  now it
[3970.04 --> 3970.66]  tastes like
[3970.66 --> 3971.80]  wafers made
[3971.80 --> 3972.18]  of honey
[3972.18 --> 3973.88]  I picture in
[3973.88 --> 3974.46]  my own head
[3974.46 --> 3974.80]  and you can
[3974.80 --> 3975.14]  do what you
[3975.14 --> 3975.50]  want here
[3975.50 --> 3976.46]  but kind
[3976.46 --> 3977.16]  of large
[3977.16 --> 3978.00]  cornflake
[3978.00 --> 3979.26]  shaped things
[3979.26 --> 3979.88]  that they
[3979.88 --> 3980.32]  just gathered
[3980.32 --> 3980.96]  buckets full
[3980.96 --> 3981.96]  of and that's
[3981.96 --> 3982.22]  what they
[3982.22 --> 3982.38]  ate
[3982.38 --> 3984.24]  but this
[3984.24 --> 3984.66]  is an
[3984.66 --> 3985.78]  example of
[3985.78 --> 3986.38]  God's
[3986.38 --> 3987.16]  continued
[3987.16 --> 3988.56]  provision for
[3988.56 --> 3989.20]  his people
[3989.20 --> 3991.16]  in spite of
[3991.16 --> 3991.88]  their grumbling
[3991.88 --> 3993.12]  and complaining
[3993.12 --> 3994.62]  and this
[3994.62 --> 3995.52]  intent
[3995.52 --> 3997.32]  functions as
[3997.32 --> 3998.06]  a test
[3998.06 --> 3998.86]  for the
[3998.86 --> 3999.16]  people
[3999.16 --> 4000.04]  and it's a
[4000.04 --> 4000.62]  point that is
[4000.62 --> 4001.18]  actually made
[4001.18 --> 4002.04]  explicit in
[4002.04 --> 4003.14]  in verse 4
[4003.14 --> 4004.36]  the Lord
[4004.36 --> 4004.78]  said to
[4004.78 --> 4005.72]  Moses I
[4005.72 --> 4006.14]  will rain
[4006.14 --> 4006.60]  down bread
[4006.60 --> 4006.96]  from heaven
[4006.96 --> 4007.30]  for you
[4007.30 --> 4007.68]  the people
[4007.68 --> 4008.16]  are to go
[4008.16 --> 4008.64]  out each
[4008.64 --> 4009.06]  day to
[4009.06 --> 4009.82]  gather enough
[4009.82 --> 4010.20]  for that
[4010.20 --> 4010.68]  day and
[4010.68 --> 4011.06]  then God
[4011.06 --> 4012.08]  says in
[4012.08 --> 4012.96]  this way
[4012.96 --> 4013.88]  I will
[4013.88 --> 4014.84]  test
[4014.84 --> 4015.76]  them
[4015.76 --> 4017.90]  now part
[4017.90 --> 4018.28]  of this
[4018.28 --> 4018.98]  test right
[4018.98 --> 4019.42]  is for the
[4019.42 --> 4019.84]  people to
[4019.84 --> 4020.54]  gather only
[4020.54 --> 4021.00]  what they
[4021.00 --> 4021.64]  need for
[4021.64 --> 4022.56]  that day
[4022.56 --> 4023.00]  with a
[4023.00 --> 4023.74]  double portion
[4023.74 --> 4024.82]  being available
[4024.82 --> 4025.54]  to them on
[4025.54 --> 4026.28]  the day prior
[4026.28 --> 4027.20]  to Sabbath
[4027.20 --> 4027.86]  the day on
[4027.86 --> 4028.34]  which God
[4028.34 --> 4029.46]  rests and
[4029.46 --> 4030.22]  the test is
[4030.22 --> 4031.02]  to show
[4031.02 --> 4031.82]  that God
[4031.82 --> 4032.18]  can be
[4032.18 --> 4032.66]  trusted
[4032.66 --> 4033.64]  every day
[4033.64 --> 4035.54]  now
[4035.54 --> 4036.96]  I want you
[4036.96 --> 4037.34]  to be sure
[4037.34 --> 4037.92]  about this
[4037.92 --> 4039.56]  whenever we
[4039.56 --> 4040.12]  talk about
[4040.12 --> 4040.46]  or whenever
[4040.46 --> 4040.98]  the Bible
[4040.98 --> 4041.92]  talks about
[4041.92 --> 4042.82]  God
[4042.82 --> 4043.64]  testing
[4043.64 --> 4044.60]  the people
[4044.60 --> 4046.26]  you need
[4046.26 --> 4046.78]  to be sure
[4046.78 --> 4047.40]  and see
[4047.40 --> 4048.08]  that that
[4048.08 --> 4049.44]  test is
[4049.44 --> 4050.36]  not used
[4050.36 --> 4051.48]  like your
[4051.48 --> 4052.42]  teachers might
[4052.42 --> 4052.88]  have used
[4052.88 --> 4053.34]  that word
[4053.34 --> 4054.10]  right one
[4054.10 --> 4054.74]  person said
[4054.74 --> 4055.92]  God is not
[4055.92 --> 4056.56]  a professor
[4056.56 --> 4057.30]  looking to
[4057.30 --> 4057.98]  fail his
[4057.98 --> 4058.52]  people at
[4058.52 --> 4058.84]  the first
[4058.84 --> 4059.42]  wrong answer
[4059.42 --> 4060.96]  right tests
[4060.96 --> 4061.68]  in the Old
[4061.68 --> 4062.72]  Testament are
[4062.72 --> 4063.64]  not trials
[4063.64 --> 4064.04]  that the
[4064.04 --> 4064.70]  people face
[4064.70 --> 4065.38]  in order to
[4065.38 --> 4066.48]  prove their
[4066.48 --> 4067.60]  worthiness of
[4067.60 --> 4068.60]  God or or
[4068.60 --> 4069.24]  to God
[4069.24 --> 4070.02]  right God
[4070.02 --> 4070.56]  does not
[4070.56 --> 4071.34]  act toward
[4071.34 --> 4072.26]  his people
[4072.26 --> 4073.26]  because they've
[4073.26 --> 4074.06]  earned his
[4074.06 --> 4075.22]  grace or his
[4075.22 --> 4075.78]  favor because
[4075.78 --> 4076.42]  they passed
[4076.42 --> 4077.00]  the test
[4077.00 --> 4077.64]  right the
[4077.64 --> 4078.26]  reality about
[4078.26 --> 4079.24]  tests in the
[4079.24 --> 4079.98]  Bible is that
[4079.98 --> 4080.38]  they're not
[4080.38 --> 4080.98]  for God
[4080.98 --> 4084.48]  right because
[4084.48 --> 4085.06]  God is God
[4085.06 --> 4085.60]  he already
[4085.60 --> 4086.16]  knows your
[4086.16 --> 4087.36]  heart and
[4087.36 --> 4087.92]  all of it
[4087.92 --> 4088.24]  there is
[4088.24 --> 4088.72]  nothing hidden
[4088.72 --> 4089.28]  from him
[4089.28 --> 4089.86]  there's no
[4089.86 --> 4090.64]  secret that
[4090.64 --> 4091.14]  you keep in
[4091.14 --> 4091.56]  the corner of
[4091.56 --> 4091.88]  your mind
[4091.88 --> 4092.28]  that God
[4092.28 --> 4092.96]  does not
[4092.96 --> 4093.22]  know
[4093.22 --> 4093.84]  instead
[4093.84 --> 4095.66]  tests in
[4095.66 --> 4096.22]  the Bible
[4096.22 --> 4097.76]  are from
[4097.76 --> 4098.32]  God
[4098.32 --> 4099.30]  for
[4099.30 --> 4100.28]  you
[4100.28 --> 4102.60]  right Moses
[4102.60 --> 4103.36]  sums this
[4103.36 --> 4104.04]  up actually
[4104.04 --> 4105.66]  why tests
[4105.66 --> 4106.22]  come to the
[4106.22 --> 4106.68]  people in
[4106.68 --> 4107.44]  chapter 20
[4107.44 --> 4108.86]  verse 20
[4108.86 --> 4110.52]  Moses said
[4110.52 --> 4111.10]  to the people
[4111.10 --> 4112.04]  do not be
[4112.04 --> 4113.44]  afraid God
[4113.44 --> 4114.18]  has come to
[4114.18 --> 4115.30]  test you so
[4115.30 --> 4115.98]  that the fear
[4115.98 --> 4116.84]  of God will
[4116.84 --> 4117.68]  be with you to
[4117.68 --> 4118.94]  keep you from
[4118.94 --> 4119.38]  sinning
[4119.38 --> 4120.68]  right God
[4120.68 --> 4121.72]  tests his
[4121.72 --> 4122.78]  people for
[4122.78 --> 4123.70]  their benefit
[4123.70 --> 4124.64]  not for his
[4124.64 --> 4124.88]  own
[4124.88 --> 4127.58]  right this
[4127.58 --> 4128.56]  is true in
[4128.56 --> 4129.08]  the case of
[4129.08 --> 4129.76]  Abram and
[4129.76 --> 4130.34]  Isaac this
[4130.34 --> 4130.92]  is true in
[4130.92 --> 4131.56]  the case of
[4131.56 --> 4132.88]  Job as he
[4132.88 --> 4134.06]  goes through
[4134.06 --> 4134.88]  his entire
[4134.88 --> 4135.54]  life with
[4135.54 --> 4136.16]  three friends
[4136.16 --> 4136.76]  around him
[4136.76 --> 4137.58]  this is true
[4137.58 --> 4138.28]  of the people
[4138.28 --> 4139.24]  in the desert
[4139.24 --> 4140.56]  right working
[4140.56 --> 4141.90]  through these
[4141.90 --> 4143.44]  tests will
[4143.44 --> 4144.68]  reveal God's
[4144.68 --> 4146.02]  character to
[4146.02 --> 4146.82]  the people so
[4146.82 --> 4147.60]  that they can
[4147.60 --> 4148.18]  learn so that
[4148.18 --> 4148.92]  we can learn
[4148.92 --> 4149.82]  what obedience
[4149.82 --> 4150.86]  to him looks
[4150.86 --> 4151.46]  like and what
[4151.46 --> 4152.04]  that feels
[4152.04 --> 4153.50]  like in a
[4153.50 --> 4154.66]  way these
[4154.66 --> 4156.10]  tests are
[4156.10 --> 4157.84]  themselves a
[4157.84 --> 4159.28]  revelation of
[4159.28 --> 4164.78]  God this
[4164.78 --> 4166.36]  actually is
[4166.36 --> 4167.50]  the the thrust
[4167.50 --> 4169.00]  behind Hebrews
[4169.00 --> 4170.56]  12 which
[4170.56 --> 4172.80]  says endure
[4172.80 --> 4174.52]  hardship as
[4174.52 --> 4176.44]  discipline God
[4176.44 --> 4177.18]  is treating you
[4177.18 --> 4178.58]  as his children
[4178.58 --> 4179.74]  no discipline
[4179.74 --> 4180.62]  seems pleasant
[4180.62 --> 4181.40]  at the time
[4181.40 --> 4182.04]  but painful
[4182.04 --> 4183.40]  later on however
[4183.40 --> 4184.48]  it produces a
[4184.48 --> 4185.12]  harvest of
[4185.12 --> 4186.30]  righteousness and
[4186.30 --> 4187.56]  peace for those
[4187.56 --> 4188.34]  who have been
[4188.34 --> 4189.98]  trained by it
[4189.98 --> 4192.34]  right in testing
[4192.34 --> 4194.48]  God is teaching
[4194.48 --> 4196.40]  right in testing
[4196.40 --> 4197.92]  God is producing
[4197.92 --> 4199.00]  a harvest of
[4199.00 --> 4200.30]  righteousness and
[4200.30 --> 4202.04]  peace in you
[4202.04 --> 4203.08]  and through you
[4203.08 --> 4204.00]  right the test
[4204.00 --> 4205.04]  here is not
[4205.04 --> 4205.74]  only about
[4205.74 --> 4206.80]  keeping sabbath
[4206.80 --> 4207.60]  or trusting
[4207.60 --> 4208.70]  God's provision
[4208.70 --> 4210.22]  it's on a
[4210.22 --> 4210.86]  deeper level
[4210.86 --> 4212.04]  about recognizing
[4212.04 --> 4212.76]  the action
[4212.76 --> 4213.76]  and the place
[4213.76 --> 4214.92]  of God
[4214.92 --> 4216.22]  in this world
[4216.22 --> 4217.32]  and in your
[4217.32 --> 4217.72]  life
[4217.72 --> 4220.40]  so throughout
[4220.40 --> 4221.82]  Israel's experience
[4221.82 --> 4222.96]  and then into
[4222.96 --> 4224.10]  the New Testament
[4224.10 --> 4226.02]  the desert
[4226.02 --> 4227.26]  the wilderness
[4227.26 --> 4229.42]  is a place
[4229.42 --> 4230.70]  of provision
[4230.70 --> 4232.44]  and sometimes
[4232.44 --> 4233.02]  of punishment
[4233.02 --> 4235.36]  and it seems
[4235.36 --> 4236.98]  clear that
[4236.98 --> 4238.44]  life for
[4238.44 --> 4239.14]  all people
[4239.14 --> 4240.54]  in some way
[4240.54 --> 4242.08]  is a wandering
[4242.08 --> 4243.46]  through the
[4243.46 --> 4243.80]  wilderness
[4243.80 --> 4246.66]  and so often
[4246.66 --> 4248.26]  like the
[4248.26 --> 4248.68]  Israelites
[4248.68 --> 4250.32]  our default
[4250.32 --> 4251.30]  response is
[4251.30 --> 4251.74]  grumbling
[4251.74 --> 4253.30]  or complaining
[4253.30 --> 4255.64]  and so the
[4255.64 --> 4256.62]  question becomes
[4256.62 --> 4257.80]  for us
[4257.80 --> 4260.28]  is has
[4260.28 --> 4261.48]  one come
[4261.48 --> 4262.00]  who has
[4262.00 --> 4262.96]  experienced
[4262.96 --> 4263.68]  the wilderness
[4263.68 --> 4265.22]  without grumbling
[4265.22 --> 4267.32]  has one
[4267.32 --> 4268.14]  come who has
[4268.14 --> 4269.10]  provided a way
[4269.10 --> 4269.84]  out of the
[4269.84 --> 4270.52]  wilderness of
[4270.52 --> 4271.56]  sin and death
[4271.56 --> 4272.26]  and temptation
[4272.26 --> 4273.32]  has one come
[4273.32 --> 4274.56]  who is himself
[4274.56 --> 4275.94]  the bread of
[4275.94 --> 4276.40]  life
[4276.40 --> 4279.94]  immediately
[4279.94 --> 4281.42]  after the
[4281.42 --> 4282.06]  baptism of
[4282.06 --> 4282.38]  Jesus
[4282.38 --> 4283.56]  in Matthew
[4283.56 --> 4283.92]  3
[4283.92 --> 4285.40]  we read the
[4285.40 --> 4285.74]  following
[4285.74 --> 4288.12]  then Jesus
[4288.12 --> 4288.90]  was led by
[4288.90 --> 4289.38]  the spirit
[4289.38 --> 4290.00]  into the
[4290.00 --> 4290.26]  desert
[4290.26 --> 4290.68]  to be
[4290.68 --> 4291.08]  tempted
[4291.08 --> 4292.28]  by the
[4292.28 --> 4292.56]  devil
[4292.56 --> 4294.10]  now that
[4294.10 --> 4294.46]  word
[4294.46 --> 4295.10]  translated
[4295.10 --> 4295.98]  by our
[4295.98 --> 4296.58]  New Testament
[4296.58 --> 4297.88]  editors
[4297.88 --> 4298.96]  as translated
[4298.96 --> 4299.72]  can also
[4299.72 --> 4300.30]  mean
[4300.30 --> 4301.38]  tested
[4301.38 --> 4303.96]  the
[4303.96 --> 4304.48]  Israelites
[4304.48 --> 4305.96]  who went
[4305.96 --> 4306.52]  into the
[4306.52 --> 4306.78]  desert
[4306.78 --> 4307.44]  for a total
[4307.44 --> 4307.92]  of 40
[4307.92 --> 4308.46]  years
[4308.46 --> 4309.48]  were tested
[4309.48 --> 4310.10]  in order
[4310.10 --> 4310.84]  to reveal
[4310.84 --> 4311.60]  God
[4311.60 --> 4311.98]  and in
[4311.98 --> 4312.66]  their test
[4312.66 --> 4313.32]  they grumbled
[4313.32 --> 4314.34]  and complained
[4314.34 --> 4315.30]  and turned
[4315.30 --> 4315.82]  around
[4315.82 --> 4316.66]  to test
[4316.66 --> 4317.38]  God
[4317.38 --> 4318.12]  Jesus
[4318.12 --> 4319.02]  who wandered
[4319.02 --> 4319.74]  into that
[4319.74 --> 4320.04]  desert
[4320.04 --> 4320.74]  for 40
[4320.74 --> 4321.36]  days
[4321.36 --> 4321.88]  and 40
[4321.88 --> 4322.18]  nights
[4322.18 --> 4322.64]  a number
[4322.64 --> 4323.06]  that is
[4323.06 --> 4323.42]  surely
[4323.42 --> 4324.06]  significant
[4324.06 --> 4325.02]  for Matthew's
[4325.02 --> 4325.40]  theological
[4325.40 --> 4325.88]  purposes
[4325.88 --> 4326.46]  he connects
[4326.46 --> 4326.88]  Jesus
[4326.88 --> 4327.98]  to Israel
[4327.98 --> 4328.64]  Jesus
[4328.64 --> 4329.58]  was hungry
[4329.58 --> 4330.44]  and needed
[4330.44 --> 4330.92]  to eat
[4330.92 --> 4332.12]  and three
[4332.12 --> 4332.70]  times
[4332.70 --> 4332.96]  the
[4332.96 --> 4334.10]  tempter
[4334.10 --> 4334.84]  comes to
[4334.84 --> 4335.10]  him
[4335.10 --> 4335.96]  and challenges
[4335.96 --> 4336.66]  him as
[4336.66 --> 4337.32]  the son
[4337.32 --> 4337.66]  of God
[4337.66 --> 4337.94]  and says
[4337.94 --> 4338.60]  if you are
[4338.60 --> 4338.94]  the son
[4338.94 --> 4339.28]  of God
[4339.28 --> 4339.84]  tell these
[4339.84 --> 4340.26]  stones
[4340.26 --> 4340.82]  to become
[4340.82 --> 4341.54]  bread
[4341.54 --> 4342.06]  if you are
[4342.06 --> 4342.36]  the son
[4342.36 --> 4342.68]  of God
[4342.68 --> 4343.46]  throw yourself
[4343.46 --> 4344.00]  down from
[4344.00 --> 4344.20]  here
[4344.20 --> 4344.94]  taking him
[4344.94 --> 4345.74]  to a high
[4345.74 --> 4346.10]  point
[4346.10 --> 4346.68]  on the land
[4346.68 --> 4347.36]  the tempter
[4347.36 --> 4347.66]  says
[4347.66 --> 4348.28]  if you
[4348.28 --> 4348.78]  but bow
[4348.78 --> 4349.10]  down
[4349.10 --> 4349.64]  and worship
[4349.64 --> 4349.88]  me
[4349.88 --> 4350.46]  I will
[4350.46 --> 4350.96]  give you
[4350.96 --> 4351.62]  all
[4351.62 --> 4352.68]  of this
[4352.68 --> 4353.10]  that you
[4353.10 --> 4353.38]  see
[4353.38 --> 4354.56]  and each
[4354.56 --> 4355.04]  time
[4355.04 --> 4355.46]  Jesus
[4355.46 --> 4356.12]  responds
[4356.12 --> 4356.48]  to the
[4356.48 --> 4356.80]  test
[4356.80 --> 4357.40]  with a
[4357.40 --> 4357.80]  word
[4357.80 --> 4358.40]  from
[4358.40 --> 4359.08]  the Lord
[4359.08 --> 4359.38]  he says
[4359.38 --> 4359.86]  man does
[4359.86 --> 4360.42]  not live
[4360.42 --> 4361.06]  on bread
[4361.06 --> 4361.40]  alone
[4361.40 --> 4361.70]  but on
[4361.70 --> 4362.22]  every word
[4362.22 --> 4362.72]  that comes
[4362.72 --> 4363.06]  from the
[4363.06 --> 4363.28]  mouth
[4363.28 --> 4363.78]  of God
[4363.78 --> 4364.32]  Jesus
[4364.32 --> 4364.62]  says
[4364.62 --> 4364.92]  do not
[4364.92 --> 4365.30]  put the
[4365.30 --> 4365.54]  Lord
[4365.54 --> 4366.04]  your God
[4366.04 --> 4366.36]  to the
[4366.36 --> 4366.76]  test
[4366.76 --> 4367.34]  away
[4367.34 --> 4367.90]  from me
[4367.90 --> 4368.18]  Satan
[4368.18 --> 4368.58]  for it
[4368.58 --> 4368.96]  is written
[4368.96 --> 4369.78]  worship
[4369.78 --> 4370.42]  the Lord
[4370.42 --> 4371.04]  your God
[4371.04 --> 4371.76]  and serve
[4371.76 --> 4372.56]  him
[4372.56 --> 4373.56]  only
[4373.56 --> 4374.32]  Jesus
[4374.32 --> 4375.02]  comes
[4375.02 --> 4375.62]  and does
[4375.62 --> 4376.44]  precisely
[4376.44 --> 4377.74]  what Israel
[4377.74 --> 4379.04]  failed to do
[4379.04 --> 4380.14]  Jesus comes
[4380.14 --> 4380.58]  and does
[4380.58 --> 4381.16]  precisely
[4381.16 --> 4381.78]  what you
[4381.78 --> 4382.40]  and I
[4382.40 --> 4383.14]  day in
[4383.14 --> 4383.88]  and day out
[4383.88 --> 4385.04]  fail to do
[4385.04 --> 4385.82]  this is the
[4385.82 --> 4386.36]  substance
[4386.36 --> 4387.58]  of the gospel
[4387.58 --> 4388.76]  spoken already
[4388.76 --> 4389.34]  to us
[4389.34 --> 4390.12]  in Exodus
[4390.12 --> 4390.62]  right that
[4390.62 --> 4391.42]  though we are
[4391.42 --> 4392.20]  more sinful
[4392.20 --> 4392.78]  than we could
[4392.78 --> 4393.94]  ever dare
[4393.94 --> 4394.60]  admit
[4394.60 --> 4395.92]  we are still
[4395.92 --> 4396.52]  yet more
[4396.52 --> 4397.30]  loved than
[4397.30 --> 4397.88]  we could ever
[4397.88 --> 4398.62]  imagine
[4398.62 --> 4399.40]  possible
[4399.40 --> 4400.14]  and out of
[4400.14 --> 4400.64]  that love
[4400.64 --> 4401.50]  Jesus comes
[4401.50 --> 4402.24]  and lives
[4402.24 --> 4402.72]  the life
[4402.72 --> 4403.12]  I should
[4403.12 --> 4403.50]  have lived
[4403.50 --> 4404.32]  and died
[4404.32 --> 4405.18]  the death
[4405.18 --> 4405.88]  that I
[4405.88 --> 4406.54]  deserve
[4406.54 --> 4407.04]  out of
[4407.04 --> 4407.66]  that love
[4407.66 --> 4408.10]  Jesus
[4408.10 --> 4409.00]  exhibited
[4409.00 --> 4409.98]  the faith
[4409.98 --> 4410.64]  that we
[4410.64 --> 4411.08]  lack
[4411.08 --> 4411.44]  and he
[4411.44 --> 4411.96]  died
[4411.96 --> 4412.62]  death
[4412.62 --> 4413.48]  in our
[4413.48 --> 4413.92]  place
[4413.92 --> 4414.74]  and so
[4414.74 --> 4415.62]  now
[4415.62 --> 4416.24]  our
[4416.24 --> 4417.06]  grumbling
[4417.06 --> 4418.12]  is turned
[4418.12 --> 4418.88]  to joy
[4418.88 --> 4420.20]  our worry
[4420.20 --> 4420.94]  is turned
[4420.94 --> 4421.98]  to worship
[4421.98 --> 4423.08]  all because
[4423.08 --> 4424.00]  of what
[4424.00 --> 4424.48]  he
[4424.48 --> 4425.56]  has
[4425.56 --> 4426.40]  done
[4426.40 --> 4430.70]  Israel's
[4430.70 --> 4431.00]  sin
[4431.00 --> 4432.54]  in the
[4432.54 --> 4432.84]  desert
[4432.84 --> 4433.16]  her
[4433.16 --> 4433.62]  her
[4433.62 --> 4434.14]  testing
[4434.14 --> 4435.04]  in the
[4435.04 --> 4435.26]  desert
[4435.26 --> 4436.06]  and throughout
[4436.06 --> 4437.08]  her history
[4437.08 --> 4437.76]  is the
[4437.76 --> 4438.20]  sin
[4438.20 --> 4438.96]  that is
[4438.96 --> 4439.46]  common
[4439.46 --> 4440.38]  to us
[4440.38 --> 4440.66]  all
[4440.66 --> 4441.08]  it is
[4441.08 --> 4441.76]  the sin
[4441.76 --> 4442.30]  of
[4442.30 --> 4442.82]  self
[4442.82 --> 4444.14]  centeredness
[4444.14 --> 4445.20]  right
[4445.20 --> 4446.24]  a conceit
[4446.24 --> 4447.10]  that says
[4447.10 --> 4448.22]  our view
[4448.22 --> 4449.04]  of the world
[4449.04 --> 4449.62]  is the
[4449.62 --> 4450.52]  only view
[4450.52 --> 4451.26]  that matters
[4451.26 --> 4452.24]  our judgment
[4452.24 --> 4452.90]  is the
[4452.90 --> 4454.04]  only right
[4454.04 --> 4454.68]  judgment
[4454.68 --> 4455.92]  our assessment
[4455.92 --> 4456.80]  of reality
[4456.80 --> 4457.46]  is the
[4457.46 --> 4457.84]  only
[4457.84 --> 4458.60]  true
[4458.60 --> 4459.46]  reality
[4459.46 --> 4460.48]  other people
[4460.48 --> 4460.84]  and maybe
[4460.84 --> 4461.42]  God himself
[4461.42 --> 4462.24]  even be damned
[4462.24 --> 4463.88]  this is
[4463.88 --> 4464.26]  self
[4464.26 --> 4465.42]  centeredness
[4465.42 --> 4467.24]  and in
[4467.24 --> 4467.72]  Christ
[4467.72 --> 4468.76]  God's
[4468.76 --> 4469.18]  gracious
[4469.18 --> 4469.72]  provision
[4469.72 --> 4470.56]  is revealed
[4470.56 --> 4471.02]  as the
[4471.02 --> 4471.68]  fulfillment
[4471.68 --> 4472.50]  in his
[4472.50 --> 4472.90]  provision
[4472.90 --> 4473.50]  of manna
[4473.50 --> 4473.88]  right
[4473.88 --> 4474.84]  once bread
[4474.84 --> 4475.74]  fell from
[4475.74 --> 4476.32]  heaven
[4476.32 --> 4476.92]  and then
[4476.92 --> 4477.36]  the one
[4477.36 --> 4477.76]  who is
[4477.76 --> 4478.14]  called
[4478.14 --> 4478.74]  the bread
[4478.74 --> 4479.28]  of life
[4479.28 --> 4479.78]  came
[4479.78 --> 4480.56]  from heaven
[4480.56 --> 4480.96]  so that
[4480.96 --> 4481.90]  we might
[4481.90 --> 4482.46]  be
[4482.46 --> 4483.22]  ushered
[4483.22 --> 4483.66]  into
[4483.66 --> 4484.64]  God's
[4484.64 --> 4485.40]  presence
[4485.40 --> 4487.20]  by grace
[4487.20 --> 4487.62]  through
[4487.62 --> 4488.14]  faith
[4488.14 --> 4488.78]  we are
[4488.78 --> 4489.20]  united
[4489.20 --> 4489.50]  to
[4489.50 --> 4489.78]  Jesus
[4489.78 --> 4490.00]  who
[4490.00 --> 4490.26]  did
[4490.26 --> 4490.72]  what
[4490.72 --> 4491.08]  Israel
[4491.08 --> 4491.36]  could
[4491.36 --> 4491.62]  never
[4491.62 --> 4491.94]  do
[4491.94 --> 4492.28]  and
[4492.28 --> 4492.42]  what
[4492.42 --> 4492.58]  we
[4492.58 --> 4492.78]  can
[4492.78 --> 4492.98]  never
[4492.98 --> 4493.18]  do
[4493.18 --> 4493.88]  by grace
[4493.88 --> 4494.14]  through
[4494.14 --> 4494.54]  faith
[4494.54 --> 4495.10]  we
[4495.10 --> 4495.36]  are
[4495.36 --> 4495.60]  now
[4495.60 --> 4496.06]  invited
[4496.06 --> 4496.32]  to
[4496.32 --> 4496.54]  a
[4496.54 --> 4496.80]  life
[4496.80 --> 4497.04]  of
[4497.04 --> 4497.68]  worshipful
[4497.68 --> 4498.38]  trust
[4498.38 --> 4498.84]  and
[4498.84 --> 4499.78]  rejoicing
[4499.78 --> 4501.00]  we sang
[4501.00 --> 4501.46]  it earlier
[4501.46 --> 4501.84]  in our
[4501.84 --> 4502.18]  service
[4502.18 --> 4502.36]  right
[4502.36 --> 4502.88]  because
[4502.88 --> 4503.58]  Christ
[4503.58 --> 4504.06]  is
[4504.06 --> 4504.42]  my
[4504.42 --> 4504.90]  savior
[4504.90 --> 4505.60]  I
[4505.60 --> 4505.90]  can
[4505.90 --> 4506.18]  know
[4506.18 --> 4506.40]  that
[4506.40 --> 4506.72]  he
[4506.72 --> 4507.20]  watches
[4507.20 --> 4507.60]  over
[4507.60 --> 4507.90]  me
[4507.90 --> 4508.12]  in
[4508.12 --> 4508.44]  such
[4508.44 --> 4508.60]  a
[4508.60 --> 4508.76]  way
[4508.76 --> 4508.94]  that
[4508.94 --> 4509.08]  not
[4509.08 --> 4509.24]  a
[4509.24 --> 4509.46]  hair
[4509.46 --> 4509.68]  can
[4509.68 --> 4509.94]  fall
[4509.94 --> 4510.18]  from
[4510.18 --> 4510.38]  my
[4510.38 --> 4510.64]  head
[4510.64 --> 4511.18]  without
[4511.18 --> 4511.64]  the will
[4511.64 --> 4512.02]  of my
[4512.02 --> 4512.30]  father
[4512.30 --> 4512.50]  in
[4512.50 --> 4512.62]  heaven
[4512.62 --> 4512.96]  in
[4512.96 --> 4513.26]  fact
[4513.26 --> 4513.86]  all
[4513.86 --> 4514.32]  things

[4515.60 --> 4515.88]  my
[4515.88 --> 4516.46]  salvation

[4528.96 --> 4529.96]  for
[4529.96 --> 4530.18]  him
[4530.18 --> 4533.42]  instead
[4533.42 --> 4533.62]  of
[4533.62 --> 4534.06]  grumbling
[4534.06 --> 4535.14]  we

[4585.50 --> 4586.20]  we
[4586.20 --> 4586.80]  now
[4586.80 --> 4587.38]  live
[4587.38 --> 4587.70]  a
[4587.70 --> 4588.10]  life
[4588.10 --> 4588.40]  that
[4588.40 --> 4588.86]  judges
[4588.86 --> 4589.26]  our
[4589.26 --> 4590.06]  circumstances
[4590.06 --> 4590.80]  not
[4590.80 --> 4591.34]  by the
[4591.34 --> 4591.80]  standards
[4591.80 --> 4592.44]  of
[4592.44 --> 4592.94]  success
[4592.94 --> 4593.26]  and
[4593.26 --> 4593.78]  achievement
[4593.78 --> 4594.34]  from
[4594.34 --> 4594.50]  the
[4594.50 --> 4594.78]  world
[4594.78 --> 4595.28]  around
[4595.28 --> 4595.62]  us
[4595.62 --> 4596.12]  a
[4596.12 --> 4596.78]  world
[4596.78 --> 4596.98]  that
[4596.98 --> 4597.16]  in
[4597.16 --> 4597.48]  so
[4597.48 --> 4597.70]  many
[4597.70 --> 4598.14]  ways
[4598.14 --> 4598.38]  is
[4598.38 --> 4599.46]  antithetical
[4599.46 --> 4599.88]  to
[4599.88 --> 4600.02]  the
[4600.02 --> 4600.38]  cross
[4600.38 --> 4600.58]  but
[4600.58 --> 4601.06]  we
[4601.06 --> 4601.56]  see
[4601.56 --> 4602.06]  our
[4602.06 --> 4602.64]  present
[4602.64 --> 4603.56]  circumstances
[4603.56 --> 4604.16]  be

[4606.84 --> 4607.14]  or
[4607.14 --> 4607.38]  of
[4607.38 --> 4607.68]  death
[4607.68 --> 4608.14]  we
[4608.14 --> 4608.46]  see
[4608.46 --> 4608.72]  them
[4608.72 --> 4609.12]  as
[4609.12 --> 4609.90]  God
[4609.90 --> 4610.74]  wants
[4610.74 --> 4611.18]  us
[4611.18 --> 4611.54]  to
[4611.54 --> 4611.78]  see
[4611.78 --> 4611.98]  them
[4611.98 --> 4613.34]  he
[4613.34 --> 4613.64]  is
[4613.64 --> 4614.02]  teaching
[4614.02 --> 4614.48]  us
[4614.48 --> 4614.98]  to look
[4614.98 --> 4615.46]  back
[4615.46 --> 4616.28]  in order
[4616.28 --> 4616.76]  that we
[4616.76 --> 4617.08]  might
[4617.08 --> 4617.42]  go
[4617.42 --> 4618.26]  forward
[4618.26 --> 4618.64]  to
[4618.64 --> 4619.04]  look
[4619.04 --> 4620.00]  to
[4620.00 --> 4621.10]  Christ
[4621.10 --> 4623.02]  and
[4623.02 --> 4623.12]  in
[4623.12 --> 4623.26]  looking
[4623.26 --> 4623.42]  to
[4623.42 --> 4623.82]  Christ
[4623.82 --> 4625.00]  we
[4625.00 --> 4625.34]  find
[4625.34 --> 4625.54]  the
[4625.54 --> 4625.86]  attitude
[4625.86 --> 4626.28]  of
[4626.28 --> 4626.54]  the
[4626.54 --> 4626.90]  apostle
[4626.90 --> 4627.26]  Paul
[4627.26 --> 4628.28]  who
[4628.28 --> 4628.56]  says
[4628.56 --> 4628.74]  in
[4628.74 --> 4629.22]  Philippians
[4629.22 --> 4629.52]  4
[4629.52 --> 4646.88]  is
[4646.88 --> 4647.12]  I
[4647.12 --> 4647.36]  can
[4647.36 --> 4647.58]  do
[4647.58 --> 4648.02]  all
[4648.02 --> 4648.40]  this
[4648.40 --> 4648.78]  through
[4648.78 --> 4649.32]  him
[4649.32 --> 4649.96]  who
[4649.96 --> 4650.82]  strengthens
[4650.82 --> 4651.50]  me
[4651.50 --> 4666.62]  is your heart is your life content right now have you learned contentment that's jesus
[4666.62 --> 4674.50]  right in in a world of of selfish grumbling and complaining of so many people imagine what a
[4674.50 --> 4682.72]  community of contentment would look like because that's supposed to be us that's supposed to be
[4682.72 --> 4693.56]  christians in the world but we are just as divided as the rest of the world maybe even more so we grumble
[4693.56 --> 4703.14]  just as much as everyone else maybe even more so don't let fear co-opt our gathered worship and
[4703.14 --> 4709.34]  discipleship opportunities in this life and don't let a wrong understanding of freedom be your cause
[4709.34 --> 4712.36]  for complaining instead
[4712.36 --> 4723.44]  instead what does it look like for us together now as a community to trust in the lord and to learn
[4723.44 --> 4729.14]  contentedness right that's the vision question that i want to leave with you as you go this week
[4729.14 --> 4735.36]  that's what you need to prayerfully reflect on in the coming days right given everything that's going
[4735.36 --> 4740.64]  on from the cost of living which is skyrocketing to housing getting further and further out of reach
[4740.64 --> 4747.52]  to political polarization to incessant demonization of those who think differently than you to the fact
[4747.52 --> 4753.08]  that russia has promised nuclear retaliation against nations who support ukraine
[4753.08 --> 4758.02]  you can grumble and complain
[4758.02 --> 4761.08]  but i for one
[4761.08 --> 4763.42]  will choose contentedness
[4763.42 --> 4766.66]  and i believe that together
[4766.66 --> 4769.36]  and this day and every day after
[4769.36 --> 4771.32]  that we can choose
[4771.32 --> 4773.04]  to serve the lord
[4773.04 --> 4774.84]  and that
[4774.84 --> 4778.20]  my friends that my brothers and sisters that
[4778.20 --> 4780.66]  my church family
[4780.66 --> 4782.98]  that
[4782.98 --> 4784.96]  will change the world
[4784.96 --> 4787.62]  will you change the world with me
[4787.62 --> 4789.44]  let's pray
[4789.44 --> 4796.54]  lord our god teach us
[4796.54 --> 4798.44]  contentedness
[4798.44 --> 4800.48]  teach us to
[4800.48 --> 4801.78]  look to you
[4801.78 --> 4804.90]  as the source of
[4804.90 --> 4806.38]  every good
[4806.38 --> 4807.32]  gift
[4807.32 --> 4809.64]  and teach us to
[4809.64 --> 4810.34]  trust
[4810.34 --> 4812.08]  in your word
[4812.08 --> 4816.78]  when we don't receive those things that we thought we needed or those things that we
[4816.78 --> 4818.76]  cried out for in want
[4818.76 --> 4821.22]  help us to trust that you
[4821.22 --> 4822.26]  are
[4822.26 --> 4823.32]  god
[4823.32 --> 4826.94]  and that it is
[4826.94 --> 4833.38]  true when you say that no good thing do you withhold from those whose walk is blameless
[4833.38 --> 4836.14]  and that we have been given
[4836.14 --> 4842.86]  righteousness that comes not from the law but that comes from faith in christ jesus that we
[4842.86 --> 4850.58]  in him are blameless and so our path forward with you is only good
[4850.58 --> 4853.82]  we know it will be
[4853.82 --> 4854.14]  we know it will be hard
[4854.14 --> 4860.06]  we know it will be
[4860.06 --> 4861.26]  impossible
[4861.26 --> 4868.48]  may we also know that with you all things are
[4868.48 --> 4869.36]  possible
[4869.36 --> 4872.08]  and that you alone
[4872.08 --> 4875.32]  will carry us through and may we be content
[4875.32 --> 4878.56]  in that truth today
[4878.56 --> 4881.90]  in christ jesus we pray
[4881.90 --> 4883.70]  amen
[4883.70 --> 4895.10]  please join us in standing
[4895.10 --> 4910.10]  by faith we see the hand of god
[4910.10 --> 4917.10]  in the light of creation's grand design
[4917.10 --> 4926.10]  in the lives of those who prove his faithfulness
[4926.10 --> 4931.10]  brought by faith and not by sight
[4931.10 --> 4933.26]  now we bear
[4933.26 --> 4933.46]  but again
[4933.46 --> 4935.70]  we lose
[4935.70 --> 4936.28]  thank you

[4981.08 --> 4986.96]  We'll walk by faith and not by sight
[4986.96 --> 4996.34]  By faith the prophets saw a day
[4996.34 --> 5003.04]  When the love of Messiah would appear
[5003.04 --> 5011.04]  With the power to break the chains of sin and death
[5011.04 --> 5017.42]  And rise triumphant from the grave
[5017.42 --> 5022.80]  By faith the church was called to go
[5022.80 --> 5030.80]  In the power of the Spirit to the Lord
[5030.80 --> 5038.18]  To deliver captives and to preach good news

[5080.94 --> 5087.94]  And the power of the gospel shall prevail
[5087.94 --> 5096.32]  For we know in Christ all things are possible
