[0.00 → 13.64] In the bleak midwinter, all creation groans
[13.64 → 20.16] For a world in darkness, frozen like a stone
[20.16 → 26.56] Light is breaking, in a stable for a throne
[26.56 → 33.70] If I were a wise man, I would travel far
[33.70 → 40.48] If I were a shepherd, I would do my part
[40.48 → 46.82] For as I am, I would give to Him my heart
[46.82 → 53.60] And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore
[53.60 → 60.74] And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore
[60.74 → 67.88] Unto us, a child is born, the King of kings, the Lord of lords
[67.88 → 75.02] And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore
[75.02 → 78.02] Here within the manger lies
[78.02 → 81.52] The one who builds the starry skies
[81.52 → 85.02] This baby born for sacrifice
[85.02 → 88.02] Christ our Messiah
[88.02 → 91.16] To our hopes and to our fears
[91.16 → 94.16] The Saviour of the world appears
[94.16 → 98.16] The promise of eternal years
[98.16 → 101.16] Christ our Messiah
[101.16 → 107.30] And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore
[107.30 → 114.30] And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore
[114.30 → 127.44] And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore
[127.44 → 129.44] And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore
[129.44 → 133.44] A child is born, the King of kings, the Lord of lords
[133.44 → 140.58] And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore
[140.58 → 146.58] And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore
[146.58 → 155.72] He shall reign forevermore, forevermore
[155.72 → 159.72] And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore
[159.72 → 160.86] And He shall reign forever, forevermore
[160.86 → 161.86] And He shall reign forever, forevermore
[161.86 → 166.86] And He shall reign forever, forevermore
[166.86 → 186.02] From the highest height of heaven's throne
[186.02 → 191.16] And perfect light of majesty
[191.16 → 196.16] This broken world became your home
[196.16 → 201.16] Our broken lives you came to heal
[201.16 → 206.16] Salvation in your name
[206.16 → 210.16] And in your heart our freedom
[210.16 → 215.30] How could we not adore
[215.30 → 217.30] How could we not adore
[217.30 → 220.30] To us, you have been born
[220.30 → 224.30] To us, you have been given
[224.30 → 230.30] Glory to you in the highest
[230.30 → 233.98] The hope of all the earth
[233.98 → 237.72] The highest name of heaven
[237.72 → 243.86] Glory to you in the highest
[243.86 → 247.86] Glory to you
[247.86 → 248.86] Glory to you
[248.86 → 252.86] Glory in the highest
[252.86 → 258.86] Into the night
[258.86 → 262.16] Into the fray
[262.16 → 264.74] Struggle and war
[264.74 → 266.88] On every side
[266.88 → 269.88] Into a world
[269.88 → 271.88] Of sin and shame
[271.88 → 274.88] You came to bridge
[274.88 → 276.88] The great divide
[276.88 → 279.88] The prince of peace
[279.88 → 282.88] And lord of life
[282.88 → 287.88] A day of grace has come
[287.88 → 290.88] The dawn of our redemption
[290.88 → 295.02] Oh let every heart
[295.02 → 296.02] And Lord
[296.02 → 301.02] To us, you have been born
[301.02 → 305.02] To us, you have been given
[305.02 → 311.02] Glory to you in the highest
[311.02 → 315.02] The hope of all the earth
[315.02 → 319.16] The highest name of heaven
[319.16 → 325.16] Glory to you in the highest
[325.16 → 329.16] Glory to you
[329.16 → 334.16] Glory in the highest
[334.16 → 339.30] Salvation in your name
[339.30 → 343.30] And in your heart our freedom
[343.30 → 346.50] Sing hallelujah
[346.50 → 349.30] Hallelujah
[349.30 → 353.30] A day of grace has come
[353.30 → 356.36] The dawn of our redemption
[356.36 → 360.16] Sing hallelujah
[360.16 → 364.30] Glory to us, you have been born
[364.30 → 366.30] To us, you have been born
[366.30 → 370.30] To us, you have been given
[370.30 → 376.30] Glory to you in the highest
[376.30 → 380.30] The hope of all the earth
[380.30 → 384.30] And the highest name of heaven
[384.30 → 388.30] Glory to you in the highest
[388.30 → 392.44] Glory to you in the highest
[392.44 → 396.04] Glory to you in the highest
[396.04 → 398.04] Glory to you in the highest
[398.04 → 401.14] Glory to your...
[401.14 → 406.50] Glory in the highest
[406.50 → 414.44] Oh, come let us adore you
[414.44 → 421.40] Oh, come let us adore Him.
[421.70 → 425.54] Oh, come let us adore Him.
[444.44 → 454.66] We are grateful that you are here and that we can get together.
[455.16 → 457.72] My name is Chris. I'm one of the pastors here.
[457.72 → 464.60] And it's my privilege, along with a few others, to lead in our shared worship together this morning.
[465.36 → 469.92] God is good, and we have a lot going on in our worship this morning,
[469.92 → 474.58] from Lord's Supper and baptism and celebrations of individual service.
[475.14 → 482.10] And so we're grateful for the chance to see God at work in so many ways in our midst
[482.10 → 492.66] and to participate in that and to long for Him to do more among us, with us, and through us to the world.
[493.48 → 497.36] Before we begin our worship in earnest, there are just a couple announcements.
[497.36 → 500.48] Kevin has two, so I'm going to invite him to the front.
[500.58 → 501.64] The microphone's over here.
[502.28 → 508.92] He can get ready, and while he's on his way over, just a reminder that next week, Sunday evening,
[509.40 → 521.00] so December 18 at 6 p.m., we are hosting a choir performance and traditional hymn-sing and Carolina here at Emanuel.
[521.00 → 527.10] And so we encourage you to come to invite your family, friends, or neighbours and join us for that.
[527.10 → 527.88] We'll have choirs.
[528.02 → 528.82] We have kids' choirs.
[528.98 → 535.80] We have hymns and carols to sing, and it should be a beautiful evening together, December 18 at 6 p.m.
[536.94 → 539.88] A reminder, there are practices for that this coming week.
[540.00 → 542.18] You know the schedule if you are involved in that.
[542.72 → 550.50] And you may have seen in the e-bulletin that went out that Mark, who is the director, is looking for a page-turner.
[551.18 → 556.10] And so that's someone who can read music and turn the pages as they move through.
[556.28 → 560.16] So the stipulation there is that you know how to read music at least decently well.
[561.44 → 565.32] Otherwise, it'll devolve into chaos very quickly, I imagine.
[566.80 → 568.22] Oh, you don't even have to read music.
[568.54 → 570.06] You just have to listen to Mark when he says, now.
[570.06 → 570.12] Now.
[574.12 → 575.22] Ken will nod his head.
[575.22 → 575.50] See?
[575.76 → 578.02] There's a system for everything that I know nothing about.
[579.26 → 592.34] Anyway, if you are willing to be a page-turner, which apparently takes no skill now, please talk to Mark following our worship together this morning, and he will give you those details.
[593.16 → 593.52] Go ahead.
[593.52 → 598.10] I have two brief announcements, and this microphone's really loud.
[598.54 → 606.88] The first is for anyone who wants to join the Spring Mexico team to head down to Tijuana on a missions trip in March.
[606.94 → 611.22] It'll happen over spring break, and this trip is open to anybody grades 10 and up.
[611.60 → 612.66] Not to grades 12.
[612.92 → 615.34] Grades 10 to, like, ever.
[615.68 → 619.34] So if you want to go on this trip, you can sign up in the back.
[619.34 → 622.12] I think it's around the Connect booth or on the table back there.
[622.12 → 623.72] Please find that sheet.
[623.78 → 626.34] We would love to get a number of people out for that.
[626.94 → 631.24] And same thing, high school students, your grade 10 and older, you're welcome to join that trip as well.
[631.30 → 632.50] So please consider doing that.
[633.00 → 638.80] If you want more information, you can chat with me after the service or find Brandon Muller, who's not here today, which is why I'm doing this announcement.
[638.92 → 642.10] But you can talk to Brandon Muller as well, and he can give you more information on that too.
[642.60 → 646.00] Second announcement is for all of those participating in Dress ember.
[646.18 → 651.44] If you're wearing a tie or a dress today, oh, I got my nice old school hockey tie on.
[651.44 → 652.70] Pastor Chris has his on here.
[652.74 → 653.30] He looks sharp.
[653.84 → 656.50] If you're doing that tomorrow, we're doing another fundraising blast.
[656.66 → 660.52] So whoever raises the most money tomorrow, if you're on that team, you get a $10 gift card.
[660.98 → 662.62] We're going to be doing those every Monday as well.
[662.78 → 665.88] If you don't know what Dress ember is, it's because you're not on social media.
[666.04 → 668.22] So you should join that and follow along with that.
[668.44 → 674.28] Again, you can come talk to me or Samara Sega or Pastor Chris or anybody who's on that team to hear more about that.
[674.56 → 678.50] So if you see someone wearing a tie or a dress today, give them an ask and see what's going on.
[678.74 → 678.98] Thanks.
[681.44 → 685.32] A bunch of people wearing dresses just went, uh-oh.
[688.58 → 690.10] One last announcement.
[690.42 → 696.46] You may have seen it in the e-bulletin that goes out, but we have a unique opportunity this year
[696.46 → 702.12] to partner with Trinity Western University and their global education program
[702.12 → 707.52] and many of their international students who are not able to go home during the Christmas holidays.
[707.52 → 711.22] And so a number of them have chosen to stay on campus.
[711.34 → 714.46] In fact, the list of students staying on campus is about 130.
[715.70 → 720.24] And they have been invited to join us for Christmas Day worship.
[720.24 → 727.50] And then our hope in prayer is to provide a family-style meal for them after our worship on Christmas Day
[727.50 → 732.02] so that they can have a bit of experience of home and family and hear the gospel,
[732.18 → 736.16] maybe even for the first time, proclaimed in a church community.
[736.16 → 740.92] And so if that's something that you are interested in or able to help with,
[740.92 → 747.54] we will be looking for people to help make a meal, to help serve and share that meal on Christmas Day
[747.54 → 748.98] after our worship together.
[749.68 → 752.70] And we will be looking for transportation solutions.
[753.22 → 754.72] We want to get our hands on a shuttle.
[754.72 → 759.96] And so if you either know of a shuttle, have a shuttle, or are licensed to drive a shuttle,
[760.18 → 764.42] I am particularly interested in hearing from you this morning to solve that problem.
[764.86 → 771.20] So this is a really neat opportunity, and I'm grateful that TWU reached out to us for that
[771.20 → 774.82] and that we can serve that community in this way.
[775.36 → 779.00] If that's something you're interested in, grab me after service together.
[779.00 → 786.30] Let's stand, and we will come to God in worship, song, prayer, and word together.
[791.08 → 796.22] Immediately following God's greeting, I'm going to invite those who are coming up to do the candles
[796.22 → 797.66] to do that on their own.
[798.72 → 802.88] In the presence of God, open your heart to receive his greeting.
[804.20 → 807.74] Grace, mercy, and peace to you.
[807.74 → 812.38] From God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, Son, and our Saviour,
[812.80 → 817.82] whose coming we await through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[818.78 → 819.18] Amen.
[837.74 → 846.22] Advent is a season of waiting, waiting for the light and darkness, waiting to be filled while empty,
[846.46 → 847.62] waiting for the return of the King.
[849.92 → 853.76] The question has always been, who or what will you love most?
[854.16 → 857.62] This world is full of competing affections that demand our attentions.
[858.14 → 860.48] From the very beginning, it has always been this way.
[860.48 → 866.52] And yet God, who is love, has shown us true love and is calling us to a better living in love.
[867.02 → 869.68] There are so many voices saying, this is love.
[869.90 → 875.46] But we submit our hearts and minds to God, the creator and sustainer, who alone can tell us.
[875.46 → 883.14] Living in anticipation of the return of the King invites us to be a people of patient endurance and faith,
[883.40 → 888.16] who can live rejoicing in the world to come, and with deep joy in the world that is,
[888.74 → 892.16] holding on to the love that holds on to us, living it boldly.
[892.72 → 896.30] We light this candle as a reminder of the love of God for his people,
[896.64 → 899.30] and the love we share that changes the world as we wait.
[899.30 → 911.58] The voice of the world is loud, the darkness is deep.
[911.72 → 915.00] Into the chaos and confusion, Jesus speaks the Clarín call.
[915.42 → 917.88] I am the light of the world, you will be a light to the world.
[929.30 → 959.28] I am the light of the world, you will be a light to the world.
[959.28 → 989.26] I am the light of the world, you will be a light to the world.
[989.28 → 1019.26] I am the light of the world.
[1019.26 → 1029.36] May you the sound of joy, may you live beneath the sound of joy.
[1029.36 → 1059.34] May you the sound of joy, may you live beneath the sound of joy.
[1059.36 → 1072.36] He rules the world with love and peace, and makes the nations prove.
[1073.86 → 1087.36] My glory is love, is not just a sense, and my mercy is love, and my mercy is love.
[1087.36 → 1105.36] May you the sound of joy, may you live beneath the sound of joy.
[1105.36 → 1111.36] May you the sound of joy, may you live beneath the sound of joy.
[1111.36 → 1117.36] May you the sound of joy, may you live beneath the sound of joy.
[1117.36 → 1123.36] May you the sound of joy, may you live beneath the sound of joy.
[1123.36 → 1137.36] May you the sound of joy, may you live beneath the sound of joy.
[1137.36 → 1143.36] May you the sound of joy, may you live beneath the sound of joy.
[1143.36 → 1157.36] May you the sound of joy, may you live beneath the sound of joy.
[1157.36 → 1163.36] May you the sound of joy, may you live beneath the sound of joy.
[1163.36 → 1169.36] May you the sound of joy, may you live beneath the sound of joy.
[1170.36 → 1171.36] May you will receive drop the sound of joy.
[1171.36 → 1173.36] May you have a sound of joy, may you live beneath the sound of joy.
[1173.36 → 1175.36] May you live beneath the sound of joy.
[1175.36 → 1177.36] May you see tourmaline sound of joy, may you live beneath the sound of joy.
[1177.36 → 1178.36] May you safe hathеничесvel day, assume a sign of joy.
[1178.36 → 1183.54] God gave this song to win
[1183.54 → 1187.36] His erring trust He runs down
[1188.00 → 1192.40] And find it how He's saved
[1192.40 → 1196.36] O Lord and God, how it shall come
[1196.88 → 1201.36] How measureless and strong
[1201.36 → 1205.04] It shall forever, forever
[1205.04 → 1209.36] Be saints and angels
[1209.36 → 1216.94] When dreams of time shall pass your way
[1216.94 → 1221.38] And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall
[1221.38 → 1225.84] When man who yearly fears to break
[1225.84 → 1230.24] On rocks and hills and mountains fall
[1230.24 → 1234.32] God's cause of truth shall still endure
[1234.32 → 1238.32] All measureless and strong
[1238.64 → 1243.42] Redeeming grace to Adam's grace
[1243.42 → 1247.32] The saints and angels sing
[1247.32 → 1251.32] O Lord and God, how rich and pure
[1251.70 → 1256.32] How measureless and strong
[1256.32 → 1260.64] It shall forever, forevermore endure
[1260.64 → 1262.64] The saints and angels sing
[1262.64 → 1267.64] The saints and angels sing
[1267.64 → 1271.64] Could we with thee the ocean fill
[1271.64 → 1275.64] And were the skies of parchment paint
[1275.64 → 1279.64] Were every stalk on earth a quill
[1279.64 → 1283.64] And every man ascribed thy trade
[1283.64 → 1287.96] To let the love of God
[1287.96 → 1292.64] Would drain the ocean dry
[1292.64 → 1296.64] Nor could the scroll contain the hope
[1296.64 → 1300.64] Who spread from sky to sky
[1300.64 → 1301.64] To time
[1301.64 → 1302.64] O Lord and God, how rich and pure
[1302.64 → 1305.64] O Lord and God, how rich and pure
[1305.64 → 1307.64] How measureless and strong
[1307.64 → 1309.64] It shall forever, forevermore endure
[1309.64 → 1310.64] Than saints and angels sing
[1310.64 → 1314.64] It shall forever, forevermore endure
[1314.64 → 1319.64] The saints and angels sing
[1319.64 → 1322.64] O Lord and God, how rich and pure
[1322.64 → 1323.64] How measureless and strong
[1323.64 → 1328.64] It shall forever, forevermore endure
[1328.64 → 1338.08] Now forevermore endure the saints and angels are.
[1342.42 → 1346.44] God, your love is so rich and pure.
[1347.20 → 1349.34] It is measureless and strong.
[1349.74 → 1354.06] Our words, they fall short of describing the wonders of your love, O Lord.
[1355.60 → 1357.70] And yet we turn away.
[1358.64 → 1361.12] How could we leave a love so rich?
[1361.52 → 1366.30] How could we walk away from a God who gives of his only son to reconcile our sin?
[1367.04 → 1368.42] We are here, aren't we?
[1368.42 → 1370.20] We are here worshipping you, God.
[1370.54 → 1374.14] We do the rhythms of church and worship and studying your word.
[1374.86 → 1378.60] But the eyes of our heart land on other loves that are not you, God.
[1379.54 → 1383.04] Sometimes we don't even notice until we are far from you.
[1383.04 → 1392.18] As we celebrate Advent and Christmas and remembering your birth, Jesus, we sit in the tension of awaiting your second coming.
[1392.86 → 1394.84] That tension is hard and messy.
[1395.76 → 1400.22] Some of us embrace the festivities and live for the all-familiar Christmas carols.
[1400.84 → 1404.08] Some of us turn to happy faces and only have tears in return.
[1404.08 → 1407.42] Some of us don't bat an eye at the changing seasons.
[1408.10 → 1417.70] All of us struggle to hold you first in our lives, above every other thing and person and life circumstance, during Christmas and year-round.
[1417.70 → 1421.00] Captivate our hearts, God.
[1421.60 → 1428.78] That when we come to you and see what you have done, we can do nothing but sing of the story of amazing love.
[1429.42 → 1438.98] For you did give of your one and only Son, love incarnate, the Saviour of humanity, born to suffer and to save, to raise us from our graves.
[1439.72 → 1441.34] You shall reign forevermore.
[1441.84 → 1444.48] To you be all praise, glory, and honour.
[1447.70 → 1477.68] To you be all praise, glory, and honour.

[1911.36 → 1924.80] We're almost home, we're almost home
[1924.80 → 1936.24] We're almost home, we're almost home
[1936.24 → 1937.28] Please be seated
[1937.28 → 1959.52] Our great pleasure this morning in worship to administer and participate in the sacrament of baptism for one of our little children among us
[1959.52 → 1970.48] Now we don't believe that there's anything inherently magical about the water that we apply to the child, right?
[1970.48 → 1974.00] The water does not wash away original sin or save the child
[1974.00 → 1980.40] We believe and know that only Jesus' life, death, resurrection, and exaltation will do that
[1980.40 → 1988.80] And we believe that this child and the parents will profess is sinful by nature and from birth
[1988.80 → 1999.28] And yet we believe that the promises of God for the forgiveness of sins and for life lived in the Holy Spirit are offered to him
[1999.28 → 2008.08] And so we baptize infants not out of superstition or just because of tradition
[2008.08 → 2012.16] Or really just because we like cute babies, although he is adorable
[2012.16 → 2021.76] Right? We baptize infants because they are covenant children and therefore should receive the sign of the covenant
[2021.76 → 2029.60] In Genesis 15, God made a covenant that is a special relationship of promise with Abraham
[2029.60 → 2035.28] This covenant was sealed with the sign of circumcision in Genesis 17
[2035.28 → 2037.84] And God promised to bless Abraham
[2037.84 → 2041.60] And for Abraham this meant two things in particular
[2041.60 → 2045.92] It meant offspring, children, and it meant land
[2045.92 → 2048.96] But at the heart of the covenant
[2048.96 → 2055.60] Was God's promise that he would be a god to Abraham and his children
[2055.60 → 2063.10] And so God cut a covenant into Israel's flesh carving out a people for himself
[2063.10 → 2069.82] And he gave them a purpose to be a light on the path home for all humanity
[2069.82 → 2073.74] Now fast-forward through the drama of scripture
[2073.74 → 2080.22] And in the fullness of time, God sent his son, Jesus, to be our saviour
[2080.22 → 2085.42] And in his death on the cross, our old self is dead and buried
[2085.42 → 2092.46] And in his resurrection, we rise to a new life, and we look forward to the new creation
[2092.46 → 2098.78] And so when we baptize in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
[2098.78 → 2103.34] The triune God seals our adoption as his children
[2103.34 → 2108.62] And he writes his name invisibly on our foreheads
[2108.62 → 2116.46] He says, you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God
[2116.46 → 2122.06] Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God
[2123.34 → 2128.46] By baptism, we have a new identity in Christ
[2128.46 → 2136.22] And so as a church, we come to administer the sacrament of baptism to Theo today
[2136.22 → 2140.22] With the weight of church history to encourage us
[2140.22 → 2144.78] The example of redemptive history to confirm our practice
[2144.78 → 2149.50] We baptize in obedience to Christ's command
[2149.50 → 2155.82] As we are about to administer the sacrament
[2155.82 → 2160.54] And as the sign of inclusion in the covenant community as circumcision was
[2160.54 → 2166.06] The water that we are about to sprinkle is a sign of cleansing from sin
[2166.06 → 2170.54] As the sprinkled blood of bulls and goats in the Old Testament was
[2171.58 → 2176.46] And we pray that Theo will take advantage of his covenant privileges
[2176.46 → 2180.30] Acknowledging his Lord all the days of his life
[2180.30 → 2184.70] And that one day, by faith, will make these promises his own
[2187.34 → 2189.10] He already knows it's going to be a hard journey
[2191.90 → 2195.58] Nathan and Maria, since you are presenting Theo for baptism
[2196.30 → 2197.82] We ask you the following questions
[2197.82 → 2200.06] I'm going to invite you to come with your family up to the front
[2200.38 → 2202.14] And just find a space here
[2206.46 → 2216.22] Just right here guys
[2220.78 → 2224.54] So I'm going to ask you two questions and then at the end you can respond
[2224.54 → 2226.22] We do with God's help
[2227.58 → 2228.54] If in fact you do
[2229.34 → 2229.74] You too
[2229.74 → 2244.46] Do you believe that your children though sinful by nature are received by God in Christ as members of the covenant and therefore ought to be baptized?
[2245.82 → 2251.82] And do you promise in reliance on the Holy Spirit and with the help of the Christians in this community gathered here
[2251.82 → 2257.42] To do all in your power to instruct Theo and all your children in the Christian faith
[2257.66 → 2263.18] And to lead them by your example into the life of Christian discipleship
[2263.66 → 2265.18] Nathan and Maria, what is your answer?
[2267.10 → 2267.50] Amen
[2269.18 → 2276.14] Our Lord said let the little children come to him and do not hinder them for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these
[2276.14 → 2282.22] And so if you are a little child or if you are young at heart, and you want to come up close to see what's going on
[2282.54 → 2285.18] We want to invite you to come here to the front
[2288.38 → 2289.34] Ruby lead the way
[2290.78 → 2291.90] Yeah, very good
[2292.86 → 2293.82] Thanks Malachi
[2294.54 → 2295.98] Not too close
[2295.98 → 2297.98] Otherwise, you're going to be in a splash zone
[2297.98 → 2312.22] Guys in just a minute. We're going to baptize Theo with this water. We will take it
[2312.78 → 2314.70] And we will pour it over his head
[2316.78 → 2319.26] We'll sprinkle it over his head I promise it won't be that much
[2321.34 → 2327.66] We will take, and this water is a picture for us of how Jesus makes us clean
[2328.30 → 2334.06] So just like sometimes hopefully recently you guys have showers or baths and that makes you clean
[2334.46 → 2337.02] Right. This is a picture for us of what
[2337.58 → 2344.62] Jesus does in his life and in his death and in his resurrection, and we're going to take this picture and put it on Theo
[2345.34 → 2345.66] today
[2349.02 → 2351.02] Bring him forward
[2353.98 → 2356.38] Theo William John
[2356.38 → 2356.86] John
[2356.86 → 2357.66] Klein Gelt ink
[2357.66 → 2360.62] I baptize you in the name of the father
[2362.70 → 2363.58] In the name of the son
[2365.82 → 2367.34] And in the name of the Holy Spirit
[2367.34 → 2369.42] Amen
[2369.42 → 2372.46] Amen
[2376.30 → 2377.18] You like that part
[2383.10 → 2384.14] Take that and help your mom
[2384.14 → 2389.10] As we have baptized
[2389.10 → 2393.82] Theo and heard the promises of god as we have heard his parents make promises
[2393.82 → 2399.26] We as a church family also have opportunity to make promises
[2400.22 → 2404.22] And so I'm going to invite you congregation here gathered to stand
[2404.22 → 2407.26] I'm, going to ask you a question
[2409.26 → 2416.70] And then following the question I invite you to respond by saying we do with god's help kids if you want to go back to your seats
[2416.70 → 2418.22] You can thank you for being up here
[2418.22 → 2426.30] Do you church family of Langley Emmanuel friends and visitors all who believe in the lord Jesus do you promise

[2436.54 → 2442.54] Do you promise to love and support them by teaching the gospel of god's love
[2443.18 → 2453.02] By being an example of Christian faith and character and by giving the strong support of god's family in fellowship prayer and service
[2453.26 → 2457.82] And maybe once in a while by babysitting so that mom and dad can go out on a date
[2457.82 → 2460.94] Congregation what is your answer?
[2463.90 → 2464.30] Amen
[2465.10 → 2465.90] You may be seated

[2966.08 → 2984.94] Thy lives be in such cleanest state
[2984.94 → 2990.30] Where ox and ass are feeding
[2990.30 → 2996.64] Good Christian, dear, for sinners here
[2996.64 → 3002.30] The silent word is pleading
[3002.30 → 3008.52] Death's fear shall pierce Him through
[3008.52 → 3014.30] The cross be born for me, for you
[3014.30 → 3020.80] Hail, hail, for one may flesh
[3020.80 → 3026.30] The faith, the Son of Mary
[3026.30 → 3044.44] So bring Him intense gold and fur
[3044.44 → 3050.38] Come, peasant King to own Him
[3050.38 → 3056.38] The King of kings salvation brings
[3056.38 → 3062.62] Let loving hearts enthrone Him
[3062.62 → 3068.20] Praise, praise the song on heart
[3068.20 → 3073.38] The Virgin sings her lullaby
[3073.38 → 3079.76] Joy, joy, joy for Christ is born
[3079.76 → 3085.38] The faith, the Son of Mary
[3085.38 → 3091.38] This, this is Christ the King
[3091.38 → 3097.12] Who shepherds guard and angels sing
[3097.12 → 3102.88] He sings to bring Him all
[3102.88 → 3108.12] The greater Son of Mary
[3108.12 → 3127.10] He sings to bring Him all
[3127.10 → 3130.20] Okay, I'd like to invite all the kids up front
[3130.20 → 3131.08] For Kids Corner
[3131.08 → 3138.20] Yeah, you guys can pull up a little closer
[3138.20 → 3142.82] Alright, how's everyone doing this morning?
[3143.20 → 3143.50] Good
[3143.50 → 3145.38] Louder, how's everybody doing?
[3145.70 → 3146.22] Good
[3146.22 → 3147.90] Ah, it's good, that's better
[3147.90 → 3151.52] The last few weeks in children's worship time
[3151.52 → 3153.72] I've learned and noticed that we're talking about
[3153.72 → 3155.54] Hearing, listening
[3155.54 → 3156.84] Hmm
[3156.84 → 3157.76] About God?
[3158.32 → 3160.44] Yes, what God's been telling us
[3160.44 → 3161.58] Or will be teaching us
[3161.58 → 3163.84] I got a question for you
[3163.84 → 3165.32] When you guys are at home sometimes
[3165.32 → 3166.12] And you're around the house
[3166.12 → 3167.26] Does your mom ever say to you
[3167.26 → 3168.72] Or dad, are you hearing me?
[3168.80 → 3170.18] Or are you, can you hear me?
[3170.24 → 3171.04] Or are you listening?
[3171.22 → 3172.54] Does that ever happen in your house?
[3172.72 → 3174.10] Yeah, sometimes, yeah?
[3175.64 → 3177.48] Like when your mom asks you to clean your room
[3177.48 → 3178.78] And you're like, and you don't
[3178.78 → 3180.76] And then she says, did you hear what I said?
[3180.76 → 3183.38] So guess what?
[3184.10 → 3185.20] I did some research
[3185.20 → 3187.10] Humans are not very good listeners
[3187.10 → 3188.78] We don't, well we're good listeners
[3188.78 → 3190.12] But we don't hear very well
[3190.12 → 3192.76] In terms of, in relation to all other animals
[3192.76 → 3193.72] On this planet
[3193.72 → 3195.44] There's some that hear better than us
[3195.44 → 3196.12] Did you know that?
[3196.52 → 3196.96] Bunnies?
[3197.52 → 3198.88] Anybody got any other ideas?
[3199.34 → 3199.60] Yeah
[3199.60 → 3202.58] Anyway, I've got five of the top
[3202.58 → 3205.78] Listening animals in the world
[3205.78 → 3207.44] Does anybody know what that is?
[3207.44 → 3208.44] The ass
[3208.44 → 3209.66] Yes, that's number one
[3209.66 → 3210.56] What's the second one?
[3210.80 → 3211.34] What's that?
[3212.22 → 3212.66] Dolphins
[3212.66 → 3212.68] Dolphins
[3212.68 → 3212.70] Dolphins
[3212.70 → 3213.56] What about the next?
[3214.76 → 3216.72] That was a little surprising to me
[3216.72 → 3217.50] What's that?
[3218.40 → 3219.82] That's a moth, actually
[3219.82 → 3221.92] And the last one is?
[3223.66 → 3224.26] Owl
[3224.26 → 3224.54] Owl
[3224.54 → 3227.20] So today we're going to go in the back
[3227.20 → 3228.52] And we're going to learn more about
[3228.52 → 3230.52] Hearing and listening to God's word
[3230.52 → 3234.34] Should we pray together first before we go?
[3235.30 → 3236.78] Hold your hands, close your eyes
[3236.78 → 3237.82] Heavenly Father
[3237.82 → 3238.80] Thank you for this day
[3238.80 → 3241.30] Thank you for all the many blessings you've given us
[3241.30 → 3243.02] Thank you for the teachers
[3243.02 → 3244.52] That are teaching your word
[3244.52 → 3246.16] In children's worship time
[3246.16 → 3248.00] I pray that we have a good time this morning
[3248.00 → 3249.84] And learning about you
[3249.84 → 3251.16] For Jesus' sake, amen
[3251.16 → 3252.20] Alright
[3252.20 → 3253.36] Stand up
[3253.36 → 3258.20] Thank you for being free
[3258.20 → 3259.06] To be a good timing
[3259.06 → 3259.68] And begin with your great information
[3259.68 → 3260.50] Thank you
[3260.50 → 3260.80] Amen
[3260.80 → 3261.58] Thank you
[3261.58 → 3263.38] Amen
[3263.38 → 3293.36] Thank you.
[3293.38 → 3303.72] Good morning.
[3303.88 → 3308.58] My name is Sam, and I'm a member here at Emanuel, and it's my privilege to lead you in prayer
[3308.58 → 3309.14] this morning.
[3309.88 → 3311.46] I do have one announcement.
[3311.46 → 3326.10] David and Leanne Harris are first-time grandparents, and they wanted us to know about that.
[3326.64 → 3333.02] Lucy Peach Gutenberg, the first child of Megan and Dylan, born late yesterday.
[3333.02 → 3335.04] So we are grateful with them.
[3340.56 → 3341.72] Please pray with me.
[3341.72 → 3345.96] Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
[3347.00 → 3354.18] We read in Isaiah, it says, for unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given, and the government
[3354.18 → 3361.22] will be upon his shoulders, and his name will be called Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God,
[3361.60 → 3364.28] Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
[3364.28 → 3369.46] As we journey in this Advent season, we are mindful of your love.
[3370.52 → 3372.48] How deep the Father's love for us!
[3373.26 → 3374.92] How vast beyond all measure!
[3375.50 → 3379.38] That he should give his only son to make a wretch his treasure.
[3379.38 → 3388.28] Jesus came into this world, not in a palace which could never match his glory, but in a cattle
[3388.28 → 3395.92] shed, born to a peasant girl and a humble carpenter, with means that would be considered under the
[3395.92 → 3397.30] poverty line today.
[3398.48 → 3401.22] We pray for a world which does not acknowledge him.
[3402.14 → 3405.74] We think of the war in Ukraine, where thousands are suffering.
[3405.74 → 3410.06] Unrest in Iran, and many other areas of this world.
[3410.92 → 3413.34] For a struggle to gain power and greed.
[3414.74 → 3418.54] May this season be a time when many will seek you as the King of Kings.
[3419.64 → 3423.56] Bless the efforts of many organizations that try to make a difference.
[3424.64 → 3427.70] The ones that are your hands and feet to bring the good news of the gospel.
[3428.88 → 3433.60] We are grateful for the many mission thrift stores which provide means for the Bible League
[3433.60 → 3441.10] of Canada to provide scriptures, training for new believers in over 43 countries in our world.
[3442.04 → 3443.00] You are faithful.
[3444.12 → 3447.72] We also pray for those that find this time a difficult one.
[3448.54 → 3452.06] Loved ones that may be missing as we gather to celebrate Christmas.
[3452.82 → 3455.66] Those unable to connect with a strange family and friends.
[3455.66 → 3462.58] We pray that you will bring restoration to marriages, to strain relationships, and allow healing to take place.
[3463.46 → 3468.62] Give a measure of your goodness to them, and pass the peace that transcends all understanding.
[3469.98 → 3475.98] We are also grateful for the successful surgery for Trudy Decries, and pray for a quick recovery in the weeks ahead.
[3475.98 → 3483.04] We pray for continued healing for John Pilot, Harry Baumann, who are recovering from recent surgeries.
[3483.82 → 3488.50] Give them your peace as they take small steps to forward to more normalized life.
[3489.26 → 3491.78] We pray for Rich Ammon's as she waits for hip surgery.
[3492.52 → 3496.92] Give patient understanding and endurance to this time of pain.
[3496.92 → 3506.56] We also bring the unspoken request for those who suffer in silence, and are not specifically named, but you know them all.
[3507.76 → 3511.42] We celebrate with the Klang-Ending family and the baptism of Theo today.
[3512.08 → 3516.80] We pray that Nathan and Maria will receive the wisdom to nurture him in the knowledge of you.
[3518.28 → 3524.58] Anoint Pastor Chris this morning as he brings your word, that his words will be focusing on Revelations 2.
[3524.58 → 3528.12] Speak to us and encourage our walk in the week to come.
[3529.10 → 3535.12] As we break bread together today, remind us of the incredible gift in the death and resurrection of your Son,
[3535.66 → 3539.50] who sits at your right hand, interceding for us continuously.
[3540.42 → 3542.44] Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly.
[3544.04 → 3553.18] Behold the man upon the cross, my sin upon his shoulders, ashamed to hear my mocking voice call out among the scoffers.
[3553.18 → 3557.88] It was my sin that held him there until it was accomplished.
[3558.54 → 3561.12] His dying breath has brought me life.
[3561.70 → 3563.26] I know that it is finished.
[3564.30 → 3566.36] Why should I gain from his reward?
[3567.00 → 3568.54] I cannot give an answer.
[3569.30 → 3571.06] But this I know with all my heart.
[3571.76 → 3573.56] His wounds have paid my ransom.
[3574.48 → 3575.44] In Christ alone.
[3576.36 → 3576.88] Amen.
[3576.88 → 3577.02] Amen.
[3583.18 → 3610.30] This Advent and Christmas season,
[3610.30 → 3613.82] we have been looking in the book of Revelation.
[3614.10 → 3617.48] We've been kind of jumping around in different places.
[3617.66 → 3621.00] We've seen some pretty strange stories
[3621.00 → 3625.62] and lived in the midst of their teachings for a little while.
[3625.74 → 3631.56] Today we come to what might be a little bit more familiar of a text to many of you.
[3631.62 → 3634.94] We're going to read together from Revelation 7.
[3634.94 → 3637.92] I'm going to read the first seven verses,
[3638.92 → 3645.92] which is the letter from Jesus through John to the church in Ephesus.
[3646.62 → 3651.70] As always, I encourage you to have a Bible open in front of you or turned on and the like.
[3652.08 → 3656.34] We're going to spend some time looking closely at Revelation 2, 1 to 7,
[3656.48 → 3661.30] but also we're going to spend some time looking at the book of Ephesians.
[3661.30 → 3664.40] So we're reading the letter to the church in Ephesus,
[3664.64 → 3666.68] and so it's pertinent for us to have Ephesians.
[3666.74 → 3669.62] So if you thumb back a couple books and have Ephesians,
[3669.74 → 3671.68] kind of put your finger in there or a piece of paper,
[3672.02 → 3674.46] you can follow along more quickly.
[3675.64 → 3679.92] Let me begin by reading from Revelation 2.
[3681.92 → 3686.14] To the angel of the church in Ephesus write,
[3686.14 → 3692.34] These are the words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand
[3692.34 → 3695.32] and walks among the seven golden lamp stands.
[3696.64 → 3701.76] I know your deeds, your hard work, and your perseverance.
[3702.52 → 3705.64] I know that you cannot tolerate wicked people,
[3705.64 → 3710.28] that you have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not,
[3710.48 → 3712.66] and have found them false.
[3712.66 → 3719.12] You have persevered and have endured hardships for my name
[3719.12 → 3721.54] and have not grown weary.
[3722.80 → 3726.30] Yet I hold this against you.
[3727.14 → 3730.96] You have forsaken the love you had at first.
[3732.14 → 3734.36] Consider how far you have fallen.
[3735.00 → 3737.72] Repent and do the things you did at first.
[3737.72 → 3742.96] If you do not repent, I will come to you and remove your lamp stand from its place.
[3744.18 → 3746.44] But you have this in your favour.
[3747.30 → 3752.22] You hate the practice of the Nicolai tans, which I also hate.
[3753.52 → 3758.64] Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
[3758.64 → 3764.40] To the one who is victorious, I will give the right to eat from the tree of life,
[3764.78 → 3767.78] which is in the paradise of God.
[3768.52 → 3770.04] This is the word of the Lord.
[3770.04 → 3780.78] Right now, in our family devotions at home,
[3781.58 → 3784.94] which we do after our evening meal together,
[3785.94 → 3788.22] because it is the season of Advent,
[3788.44 → 3793.22] and because we are currently reading through the book Seeking God's Face,
[3793.76 → 3796.16] if you're not familiar with that devotional book,
[3796.16 → 3800.76] it's a collection of scriptures and confessional texts
[3800.76 → 3803.54] from the Reformed tradition more broadly,
[3804.02 → 3807.50] sort of following the structure of the Revised Common Lectionary,
[3808.34 → 3810.20] following the liturgical calendar,
[3810.94 → 3814.12] and leads through scriptures and prayers.
[3814.94 → 3818.64] It's a fascinating book as you move through the year together.
[3819.16 → 3823.92] Anyway, as part of our doing that as a family this Advent season,
[3823.92 → 3827.40] we also have our Advent wreath out,
[3827.48 → 3829.64] where we have candles in that wreath,
[3829.78 → 3832.28] and we read the blessing,
[3832.58 → 3834.42] which is just a verse from a psalm,
[3834.50 → 3838.10] and then one of our kids will light the Advent candle,
[3839.10 → 3841.78] and then we'll do the readings and the like,
[3841.88 → 3845.08] and then when we have done the concluding prayer,
[3845.42 → 3849.08] the same person who lit the candle gets to blow it out at the end.
[3849.08 → 3854.32] Now, we go through and do that every day,
[3854.44 → 3856.90] so the first week of devotions we light one candle,
[3857.08 → 3858.98] and then the second week we light two candles.
[3859.38 → 3861.72] Today is the first day of the third week of Advent,
[3861.84 → 3864.16] so we'll light three tonight when we do that.
[3865.86 → 3868.64] Now, I have to say that as we've been doing this,
[3868.86 → 3873.02] my kids are really excited for family devotional time,
[3873.66 → 3874.94] or at least that's what I thought,
[3874.94 → 3877.02] because really they're excited to light the candle,
[3878.28 → 3881.28] to get the lighters flicker switch out of the drawer,
[3881.46 → 3883.90] to run over and to light the candle,
[3884.06 → 3885.98] and then to play with the burning candle,
[3886.04 → 3887.76] but not actually play with the burning candle.
[3887.86 → 3889.76] You know how kids like kind of lean forward,
[3889.88 → 3892.94] and they talk with a little extra blowing
[3893.64 → 3895.90] to see if they can make it flicker or blow out,
[3896.08 → 3897.96] and then when we finally finish,
[3898.04 → 3898.94] we say amen, and they go.
[3898.94 → 3902.62] So there's this excitement that they have,
[3903.02 → 3905.94] but it's not for what we wanted them to be excited about,
[3906.34 → 3909.22] and yet we are going through the rhythms.
[3909.80 → 3913.30] Now, I think that kind of can function for us generally
[3913.30 → 3917.38] as a parallel or a parable, maybe,
[3917.74 → 3922.10] for our moving through these seasons, right?
[3922.14 → 3923.36] We want you to be excited,
[3923.58 → 3926.28] but sometimes we get excited about the wrong things,
[3926.28 → 3927.84] or we get really excited,
[3928.10 → 3930.64] and then it kind of wanes a little bit,
[3930.74 → 3932.06] and then we get excited again,
[3932.12 → 3935.94] and then it lessens a little bit more, right?
[3935.98 → 3937.06] I think for some of us,
[3937.12 → 3940.76] that's our experience of Christmas and Advent,
[3940.92 → 3942.74] this excitement and it's waning,
[3942.88 → 3943.86] and then excitement again,
[3943.94 → 3945.50] and then back to waning.
[3946.12 → 3949.06] Now, maybe for you, it's a different pattern, right?
[3949.08 → 3952.18] Maybe it's excitement, but then apathy,
[3952.18 → 3954.52] or maybe it's excitement,
[3954.88 → 3957.10] but then you remember that thing,
[3957.30 → 3960.38] and that, oh man, that guy cut you off,
[3960.46 → 3964.18] and then you're back in anger for a little while.
[3965.28 → 3968.68] And maybe it's not even moving from one extreme to another,
[3969.10 → 3970.72] right, like excitement to apathy.
[3971.12 → 3974.28] Maybe this is just a season of grief for you,
[3974.30 → 3976.10] or you're under a shadow of doubt,
[3976.10 → 3978.94] or your faith is just full of despair,
[3978.94 → 3983.54] or, and so this Advent and Christmas is hard.
[3985.34 → 3987.74] Now, in our Advent series here,
[3988.14 → 3992.12] we have been adding another layer to that,
[3992.68 → 3996.42] because not only is Advent a season of looking back
[3996.42 → 3999.44] and of waiting for the Christ child,
[3999.74 → 4003.80] it is also a season of anticipating his return,
[4004.36 → 4007.60] a season where we look into the future
[4007.60 → 4009.80] to look forward to the day
[4009.80 → 4014.68] where Christ will come again in glory, right?
[4014.72 → 4017.28] And so to all of that excitement and waning,
[4017.52 → 4019.46] to all that excitement and apathy,
[4019.76 → 4023.40] to all of that grief and groaning or doubt,
[4023.62 → 4028.48] we are adding the layer of a future anticipation.
[4028.48 → 4032.74] And it has been our contention,
[4032.86 → 4033.94] our point here,
[4033.94 → 4037.94] that it is precisely this future anticipation
[4037.94 → 4042.06] that allows us or fuels us
[4042.06 → 4046.52] to live in the midst of grief with hope,
[4046.56 → 4049.88] or to live in the midst of despair with rejoicing,
[4050.08 → 4052.36] properly defined and understood, of course, right?
[4052.52 → 4054.94] And so looking at the book of Revelation,
[4054.94 → 4057.86] we have been allowing God's Spirit
[4057.86 → 4061.32] to fill our lives with patient endurance,
[4061.68 → 4063.58] with a particular meaning,
[4064.58 → 4067.44] and to fill our faith with a unique purpose.
[4068.58 → 4071.00] We've reiterated that in our candle lighting.
[4071.42 → 4073.86] We've said it over and over again each week here,
[4074.00 → 4078.42] but living in anticipation of the return of the King
[4078.42 → 4083.52] invites us to be a people of patient endurance and faith,
[4083.52 → 4087.24] who can live rejoicing in the world to come
[4087.24 → 4090.44] and with joy in the world that is,
[4091.16 → 4094.90] holding on to the love that holds on to us
[4094.90 → 4096.60] and living it boldly,
[4097.44 → 4101.72] longing for the day when all will be made whole.
[4103.88 → 4108.50] This morning, we're going to dig into that third part,
[4108.66 → 4112.22] holding on to the love that holds on to us,
[4112.22 → 4114.34] living it boldly.
[4115.10 → 4117.50] Now to do that, we've read from Revelation 2,
[4117.62 → 4118.66] this first section here,
[4119.00 → 4123.40] and our particular focus is going to come from verse 4,
[4123.54 → 4125.20] and so you might have that there,
[4125.66 → 4129.48] where Jesus says through John to the church in Ephesus,
[4129.74 → 4132.10] yet this I hold against you.
[4132.90 → 4136.86] You have forsaken the love you had at first.
[4136.86 → 4140.50] Now, just to get everyone caught up
[4140.50 → 4143.06] and to make sure that we're all on the same page here,
[4143.42 → 4147.10] Revelation sort of has two halves to it,
[4147.14 → 4149.20] or two parts, in a sense.
[4149.52 → 4152.50] The first part, which is not actually near half the letter,
[4152.80 → 4155.36] is the first three chapters, right?
[4155.38 → 4156.20] It's the introduction,
[4156.46 → 4158.46] and it's the seven letters to the churches
[4158.46 → 4160.14] of a particular area.
[4160.32 → 4161.88] Now, if you have your Bible open,
[4161.88 → 4164.30] you'll see in chapter 1, verse 10,
[4165.10 → 4166.48] John writes,
[4166.76 → 4169.48] On the Lord's day I was in the Spirit,
[4169.74 → 4173.72] and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet,
[4174.10 → 4174.60] which said,
[4175.28 → 4177.38] Write on a scroll what you see,
[4177.54 → 4179.34] and send it to the seven churches,
[4179.76 → 4182.16] to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum,
[4183.80 → 4187.20] Theatre, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.
[4187.20 → 4192.50] Now, you can see, we have an image there,
[4193.08 → 4195.40] that the locations of these churches
[4195.40 → 4199.18] are in the western part of what we would call
[4199.18 → 4200.60] modern-day Turkey.
[4200.74 → 4202.94] They're kind of collected there together.
[4204.40 → 4208.46] And the first letter is to the church of Ephesus.
[4209.64 → 4213.96] And our focus this morning in this letter
[4213.96 → 4216.34] actually starts out really strong,
[4216.64 → 4218.34] and it's full of lots of praise
[4218.34 → 4219.76] for the church there, right?
[4219.82 → 4221.12] Like, look at it again.
[4221.20 → 4223.74] Jesus says, right, through John's writing,
[4223.82 → 4224.00] he says,
[4224.08 → 4226.00] I know what you've done, right?
[4226.02 → 4227.08] I know your hard work.
[4227.16 → 4228.56] I know how you've persevered.
[4228.72 → 4231.02] I know that you've tested for the truth,
[4231.18 → 4233.40] and that you have challenged those who came in
[4233.40 → 4234.44] and claimed to be apostles,
[4234.58 → 4237.00] but you've tested it and discerned with them
[4237.00 → 4238.28] and found out that they weren't,
[4238.46 → 4239.60] and you kicked them out.
[4239.74 → 4240.96] I know that you have persevered.
[4241.12 → 4243.10] I know that you have endured hardships.
[4243.10 → 4245.38] I know that you have faced persecution.
[4246.00 → 4250.36] I know that you have not grown weary in doing so.
[4251.72 → 4253.16] Now, I don't know about you,
[4253.26 → 4256.90] but I, for one, would love to hear Jesus say that to me,
[4257.56 → 4259.16] right, that I have done these things,
[4259.26 → 4260.96] that I have met these challenges
[4260.96 → 4262.46] that have been placed in front of me.
[4264.20 → 4267.12] But then there's a shift in tone.
[4267.30 → 4268.02] Jesus says,
[4268.02 → 4270.80] Yet this I hold against you.
[4271.26 → 4275.54] You have forsaken the love you had at first.
[4276.90 → 4278.10] Now, as I read that,
[4278.64 → 4279.76] that begs a question.
[4280.76 → 4283.46] What love have they forsaken?
[4285.00 → 4285.78] Now, at first glance,
[4285.92 → 4288.26] you might think there's an easy answer to that question.
[4288.36 → 4290.46] We might say that the church in Ephesus
[4290.46 → 4293.68] allowed secondary things to become primary things,
[4293.98 → 4294.18] right,
[4294.18 → 4297.72] or that the church in Ephesus forgot the priority of loving Jesus,
[4298.04 → 4301.02] that the church in Ephesus forgot to love God
[4301.02 → 4305.14] and to love the God who first loved them.
[4305.76 → 4307.08] Or, at the very least,
[4307.14 → 4309.60] you can argue that they've moved that down
[4309.60 → 4312.34] to a secondary or tertiary, right,
[4312.42 → 4314.18] level priority.
[4315.14 → 4316.24] And to be fair,
[4316.70 → 4319.12] I've heard good pastors and theologians
[4319.12 → 4321.32] interpret this text that way.
[4321.32 → 4324.88] But two things on that.
[4325.66 → 4325.96] First,
[4327.28 → 4330.34] I don't think that that takes into account
[4330.34 → 4332.84] the meaning of the word forsaken,
[4333.62 → 4334.02] right,
[4334.06 → 4335.72] which is a pretty strong word
[4335.72 → 4338.86] for Jesus to speak here, right?
[4338.90 → 4340.52] The word that's written in Greek
[4340.52 → 4343.58] can mean to send away,
[4343.72 → 4344.86] like to force out,
[4345.10 → 4348.82] and it's actually sometimes even translated as divorce.
[4350.04 → 4350.74] To divorce.
[4350.74 → 4351.26] And so,
[4351.38 → 4353.18] it's a really strong word
[4353.18 → 4354.94] that Jesus is using.
[4355.12 → 4355.60] And in fact,
[4355.70 → 4356.34] I think,
[4356.68 → 4358.10] and we'll get into this in a minute,
[4358.22 → 4360.32] I think that the marriage image
[4360.32 → 4361.54] of this word
[4361.54 → 4363.34] and the broken marriage image
[4363.34 → 4365.06] helps us understand
[4365.06 → 4365.90] the criticism
[4365.90 → 4368.28] that Jesus has for the church in Ephesus.
[4368.88 → 4369.08] And so,
[4369.16 → 4369.78] hang on to that.
[4369.78 → 4374.16] The second thing I think we need to do
[4374.16 → 4376.78] is actually go to another source
[4376.78 → 4379.46] for what we know about the church in Ephesus.
[4379.46 → 4381.34] And I've already alluded to this, right?
[4381.42 → 4382.24] Luckily for us,
[4382.24 → 4384.04] we have another letter
[4384.04 → 4385.56] that has a firsthand account
[4385.56 → 4388.04] of exactly what the church in Ephesus
[4388.04 → 4388.94] was facing
[4388.94 → 4390.38] and dealing with
[4390.38 → 4391.38] and struggling with.
[4391.38 → 4392.70] And so,
[4392.86 → 4394.56] if you have your Bibles
[4394.56 → 4395.58] in front of you,
[4395.70 → 4396.16] I encourage you,
[4396.22 → 4398.50] flip over a few pages back
[4398.50 → 4400.54] to the book of Ephesians.
[4400.54 → 4405.12] Now, this is a letter
[4405.12 → 4406.50] that Paul writes
[4406.50 → 4408.06] to the Ephesian church.
[4408.48 → 4410.14] The Ephesian church is one,
[4410.38 → 4412.36] or gathering of house churches
[4412.36 → 4414.00] probably in the city of Ephesus,
[4414.34 → 4416.00] is one that he planted,
[4416.14 → 4416.80] that he started
[4416.80 → 4418.32] on his missionary journey
[4418.32 → 4419.14] into the region.
[4419.44 → 4421.88] And he continues to engage with them
[4421.88 → 4423.36] through letter writing.
[4423.86 → 4424.96] He continues to do so
[4424.96 → 4426.12] even as he is in prison
[4426.12 → 4427.14] in chains for the gospel.
[4427.30 → 4428.06] He's writing letters
[4428.06 → 4429.10] to these churches.
[4429.10 → 4431.18] He's familiar with this church
[4431.18 → 4432.00] and with these people.
[4432.14 → 4433.16] He knows their structure.
[4433.32 → 4434.18] He knows their leadership.
[4434.60 → 4436.00] He knows who they are
[4436.00 → 4437.08] and the things
[4437.08 → 4439.42] that they have endured together.
[4440.68 → 4442.22] The letter of Ephesians
[4442.22 → 4443.50] is a beautiful book,
[4443.54 → 4444.52] and I encourage you,
[4444.56 → 4445.40] as you have time,
[4445.56 → 4446.94] to read it on your own.
[4447.40 → 4448.24] And if you can,
[4448.30 → 4449.14] do it in one sitting
[4449.14 → 4449.76] so that you can get
[4449.76 → 4450.68] the whole scope of it.
[4451.40 → 4453.52] It is a beautiful articulation
[4453.52 → 4454.34] of the gospel,
[4454.50 → 4455.02] what it means
[4455.02 → 4456.78] to be made alive in Christ,
[4456.94 → 4458.72] and then how we can connect
[4458.72 → 4459.66] the gospel
[4459.66 → 4460.58] and being made alive
[4460.58 → 4461.04] in Jesus
[4461.04 → 4462.82] to the everyday stuff of life,
[4462.86 → 4464.04] how we are to live,
[4464.38 → 4465.58] how we are to understand
[4465.58 → 4467.36] and manage our houses
[4467.36 → 4468.52] and our businesses
[4468.52 → 4470.10] and our marriage relationships,
[4470.10 → 4471.36] how we are to endure
[4471.36 → 4472.56] testing and trial
[4472.56 → 4473.70] by putting on
[4473.70 → 4474.86] the armour of God.
[4475.54 → 4477.12] There's beautiful depth to it.
[4478.42 → 4479.40] But pertinent
[4479.40 → 4480.94] to our discussion
[4480.94 → 4482.12] this morning,
[4482.68 → 4484.18] there is one theme
[4484.18 → 4485.44] that runs
[4485.44 → 4487.08] through the entire letter
[4487.08 → 4488.78] that highlights something
[4488.78 → 4490.58] of the Ephesian church
[4490.58 → 4491.16] for us.
[4491.86 → 4492.28] Again,
[4492.38 → 4493.20] if your Bibles are open,
[4493.26 → 4494.78] look at verse 15.
[4495.44 → 4496.24] Paul has spoken
[4496.24 → 4497.50] a word of introduction.
[4498.04 → 4498.72] He has beautifully
[4498.72 → 4499.76] and succinctly
[4499.76 → 4500.92] recapped the gospel
[4500.92 → 4501.42] for them
[4501.42 → 4502.24] and their inclusion
[4502.24 → 4504.16] into this ministry
[4504.16 → 4504.88] and the effect
[4504.88 → 4505.38] of the gospel
[4505.38 → 4505.86] by the work
[4505.86 → 4506.60] of the Holy Spirit.
[4506.72 → 4507.62] And then in verse 15,
[4507.72 → 4508.18] he says,
[4508.18 → 4510.36] For this reason,
[4510.88 → 4511.98] ever since I heard
[4511.98 → 4512.78] about your faith
[4512.78 → 4513.82] in the Lord Jesus
[4513.82 → 4515.82] and your love
[4515.82 → 4518.08] for all God's people,
[4518.66 → 4520.66] I have not stopped
[4520.66 → 4521.80] giving thanks for you,
[4522.24 → 4523.08] remembering you
[4523.08 → 4524.52] in all my prayers.
[4525.40 → 4526.76] What does Paul note
[4526.76 → 4527.60] about this church?
[4528.44 → 4529.38] Their love
[4529.38 → 4530.84] for all God's people.
[4532.54 → 4533.14] Right?
[4533.20 → 4533.94] There's a theme
[4533.94 → 4534.94] that runs
[4534.94 → 4535.82] through the heart
[4535.82 → 4537.08] of Ephesians
[4537.08 → 4537.82] that is about
[4537.82 → 4540.18] loving God's people.
[4540.34 → 4541.30] It's about understanding
[4541.30 → 4542.02] properly
[4542.02 → 4543.14] the miracle
[4543.14 → 4544.30] and the majesty
[4544.30 → 4546.44] of being the bride
[4546.44 → 4547.72] of Christ,
[4548.26 → 4549.34] of being the church.
[4550.96 → 4551.18] Now,
[4551.32 → 4551.82] I'm going to do this
[4551.82 → 4552.28] really quick
[4552.28 → 4553.18] and so as Kevin
[4553.18 → 4554.04] would like to say,
[4554.36 → 4554.98] buckle up
[4554.98 → 4556.24] because we're going
[4556.24 → 4556.74] to dig in.
[4557.72 → 4558.38] Bible's open.
[4558.78 → 4559.40] Chapter 2,
[4559.50 → 4559.96] Ephesians,
[4560.12 → 4560.60] verse 11.
[4560.74 → 4561.28] Paul begins
[4561.28 → 4561.90] this discussion.
[4562.06 → 4562.32] He says,
[4562.76 → 4563.20] Remember
[4563.20 → 4565.40] that formerly
[4565.40 → 4566.94] you who are Gentiles,
[4566.94 → 4568.28] Gentiles just means
[4568.28 → 4569.16] not Jewish.
[4569.82 → 4569.90] Right?
[4569.96 → 4571.76] And so in the ancient world,
[4571.90 → 4574.58] particularly from Christianity
[4574.58 → 4576.42] that emerged out of Judaism,
[4577.30 → 4578.36] you have the Jewish world
[4578.36 → 4579.42] and then everybody else.
[4580.04 → 4581.62] That category of everybody else,
[4582.16 → 4582.62] Gentiles.
[4582.88 → 4583.88] Another way to translate that
[4583.88 → 4584.58] is nations.
[4585.38 → 4586.66] So the non-Jewish people.
[4589.16 → 4590.30] Remember that formerly
[4590.30 → 4591.44] you who are Gentiles
[4591.44 → 4591.96] by birth
[4591.96 → 4593.48] and called uncircumcised
[4593.48 → 4594.90] by those who call themselves
[4594.90 → 4595.66] the circumcision.
[4595.92 → 4596.34] So again,
[4596.72 → 4597.02] Jews,
[4597.24 → 4597.70] Gentiles.
[4599.22 → 4599.68] Remember
[4599.68 → 4601.08] that at that time
[4601.08 → 4602.54] you were separate
[4602.54 → 4603.30] from Christ,
[4603.52 → 4604.72] excluded from citizenship
[4604.72 → 4605.40] in Israel
[4605.40 → 4606.24] and foreigners
[4606.24 → 4607.16] to the covenants
[4607.16 → 4607.94] of the promise
[4607.94 → 4609.00] without hope
[4609.00 → 4609.84] and without God
[4609.84 → 4610.42] in the world.
[4610.78 → 4611.38] But now
[4611.38 → 4612.78] in Christ Jesus
[4612.78 → 4613.80] you who were
[4613.80 → 4614.98] once far away
[4614.98 → 4616.16] have been brought near
[4616.16 → 4617.36] by the blood
[4617.36 → 4618.40] of Christ.
[4619.30 → 4620.14] And then he goes on,
[4620.46 → 4621.00] 14,
[4621.00 → 4622.58] for he himself
[4622.58 → 4623.62] is our peace
[4623.62 → 4624.54] who has made
[4624.54 → 4625.52] the two groups
[4625.52 → 4626.04] one
[4626.04 → 4627.26] and has destroyed
[4627.26 → 4627.94] the barrier,
[4628.12 → 4629.20] the dividing wall
[4629.20 → 4630.40] of hostility.
[4630.52 → 4631.54] Just a little further down,
[4631.76 → 4632.36] his purpose
[4632.36 → 4633.44] was to create
[4633.44 → 4634.16] in himself
[4634.16 → 4635.78] one new humanity
[4635.78 → 4636.90] out of the two
[4636.90 → 4638.38] thus making peace
[4638.38 → 4639.96] and in one body
[4639.96 → 4640.88] to reconcile
[4640.88 → 4642.82] both of them
[4642.82 → 4643.50] to God
[4643.50 → 4645.16] through the cross.
[4645.82 → 4646.56] And then he carries
[4646.56 → 4647.04] this line
[4647.04 → 4647.88] of argument forward
[4647.88 → 4648.62] and he concludes
[4648.62 → 4649.92] in verse 19,
[4651.02 → 4651.78] Consequently,
[4652.14 → 4653.14] you are no longer
[4653.14 → 4654.48] foreigners and strangers
[4654.48 → 4655.86] but fellow citizens
[4655.86 → 4656.98] with God's people
[4656.98 → 4658.20] and members
[4658.20 → 4660.52] of his household.
[4662.10 → 4663.40] This is the theological
[4663.40 → 4664.24] foundation
[4664.24 → 4665.74] of church unity.
[4666.74 → 4667.88] This is the theological
[4667.88 → 4669.22] and spiritual foundation
[4669.22 → 4670.86] of what unites us,
[4671.00 → 4671.72] even us,
[4671.78 → 4672.44] all together.
[4673.58 → 4674.86] In the early church
[4674.86 → 4676.70] it was Gentiles,
[4676.84 → 4677.68] non-Jewish people
[4677.68 → 4678.62] being included
[4678.62 → 4679.82] into the lineage
[4679.82 → 4681.94] of Abraham's heirs.
[4683.84 → 4685.50] And I suggest to you,
[4686.20 → 4689.92] I suggest to you
[4689.92 → 4691.94] that in the modern church,
[4692.62 → 4692.90] right,
[4693.38 → 4693.78] today,
[4694.02 → 4695.10] because most of us,
[4695.42 → 4696.34] probably all of us,
[4696.38 → 4697.10] I think actually,
[4697.46 → 4698.32] are Gentiles,
[4698.42 → 4699.70] that is we're not Jewish,
[4699.84 → 4701.36] ethnically or religiously,
[4702.08 → 4702.30] right,
[4702.70 → 4703.84] in the modern church
[4703.84 → 4705.04] what this unity
[4705.04 → 4706.12] looks like
[4706.12 → 4709.18] is the transcendence
[4709.18 → 4710.12] that Revelation
[4710.12 → 4711.06] will talk about
[4711.06 → 4711.96] as the church
[4711.96 → 4712.66] being made up
[4712.66 → 4713.52] of every nation,
[4714.00 → 4714.40] tribe,
[4714.58 → 4715.16] and tongue.
[4716.06 → 4716.28] Right,
[4716.32 → 4717.36] the church of Jesus
[4717.36 → 4719.38] is out of necessity
[4719.38 → 4720.68] and by consequence
[4720.68 → 4721.68] of the gospel
[4721.68 → 4722.64] diverse
[4722.64 → 4724.00] and multi-ethnic
[4724.00 → 4725.08] and multi-culture.
[4725.08 → 4727.58] to be a Christian
[4727.58 → 4728.52] transcends
[4728.52 → 4729.82] national identity,
[4730.18 → 4731.02] to be a Christian
[4731.02 → 4731.70] transcends
[4731.70 → 4733.00] racial identity,
[4733.20 → 4733.96] to be a Christian
[4733.96 → 4734.76] transcends
[4734.76 → 4735.80] to include
[4735.80 → 4736.40] any
[4736.40 → 4737.50] who believe
[4737.50 → 4738.42] and therefore
[4738.42 → 4739.28] have a heavenly
[4739.28 → 4740.32] citizenship.
[4741.60 → 4742.52] And so,
[4742.74 → 4743.32] Paul
[4743.32 → 4744.72] prays.
[4745.52 → 4746.52] He prays,
[4747.06 → 4747.36] right,
[4747.36 → 4749.14] for this reason
[4749.14 → 4750.02] I kneel
[4750.02 → 4751.94] before the Father
[4751.94 → 4752.96] from whom
[4752.96 → 4753.86] every family
[4753.86 → 4754.48] in heaven
[4754.48 → 4755.44] and on earth
[4755.44 → 4756.44] derives its name.
[4757.12 → 4758.00] And then you can jump
[4758.00 → 4758.80] in chapter 3,
[4758.86 → 4759.54] verse 17,
[4760.34 → 4760.58] right,
[4760.62 → 4760.96] he says,
[4761.46 → 4762.38] and I pray that you
[4762.38 → 4763.26] being rooted
[4763.26 → 4763.96] and established
[4763.96 → 4764.50] in love
[4764.50 → 4765.42] may have power
[4765.42 → 4766.28] together with all
[4766.28 → 4767.42] the Lord's holy people
[4767.42 → 4768.64] to grasp how wide
[4768.64 → 4769.40] and long
[4769.40 → 4769.92] and high
[4769.92 → 4770.56] and deep
[4770.56 → 4771.22] is the love
[4771.22 → 4771.78] of Christ
[4771.78 → 4772.72] and to know
[4772.72 → 4773.80] that this love
[4773.80 → 4775.08] that surpasses
[4775.08 → 4775.42] knowledge
[4775.42 → 4776.32] that you may be
[4776.32 → 4776.88] filled
[4776.88 → 4777.76] to the measure
[4777.76 → 4778.38] of all
[4778.38 → 4779.16] the fullness
[4779.16 → 4780.56] of God.
[4782.02 → 4782.66] The love
[4782.66 → 4783.54] of Christ
[4783.54 → 4785.34] for his bride
[4785.34 → 4786.58] connects
[4786.58 → 4787.32] intimately
[4787.32 → 4789.08] and decidedly
[4789.08 → 4790.14] to the love
[4790.14 → 4791.02] of his church
[4791.02 → 4792.84] as his bride,
[4793.10 → 4794.08] as his people.
[4794.46 → 4795.10] The love
[4795.10 → 4795.90] of Christ
[4795.90 → 4796.44] connects
[4796.44 → 4797.12] to the love
[4797.12 → 4797.98] of unity
[4797.98 → 4799.58] within the church,
[4800.46 → 4800.58] right,
[4800.62 → 4801.52] to the oneness
[4801.52 → 4802.46] of the church.
[4803.26 → 4803.54] And so,
[4803.62 → 4804.30] Paul writes
[4804.30 → 4805.16] to Ephesians
[4805.16 → 4806.32] in chapter 4,
[4806.32 → 4807.00] verse 3,
[4807.44 → 4808.46] make every effort
[4808.46 → 4809.50] to keep the unity
[4809.50 → 4810.40] of the spirit
[4810.40 → 4811.22] through the bond
[4811.22 → 4811.78] of peace.
[4812.18 → 4813.42] There is one body
[4813.42 → 4814.26] and one spirit
[4814.26 → 4815.10] just as you were
[4815.10 → 4816.14] called to one hope
[4816.14 → 4816.94] when you were called,
[4817.06 → 4817.58] one Lord,
[4817.70 → 4818.18] one faith,
[4818.30 → 4818.94] one baptism,
[4819.64 → 4820.20] one God
[4820.20 → 4820.76] and Father
[4820.76 → 4821.90] of all
[4821.90 → 4823.10] who was over all
[4823.10 → 4823.94] and through all
[4823.94 → 4824.88] and in all.
[4827.08 → 4828.32] The oneness
[4828.32 → 4830.08] of our faith
[4830.08 → 4831.50] is illustrative
[4831.50 → 4833.26] in our unity.
[4833.26 → 4834.90] the oneness
[4834.90 → 4835.48] of God
[4835.48 → 4836.10] himself
[4836.10 → 4837.60] is held up
[4837.60 → 4838.54] as an example
[4838.54 → 4839.76] for the unity
[4839.76 → 4840.82] of his church.
[4842.00 → 4842.66] And so,
[4842.74 → 4843.20] all of this
[4843.20 → 4843.90] is to say,
[4845.04 → 4846.64] if you love God,
[4847.32 → 4848.40] you will
[4848.40 → 4849.56] love his church,
[4850.50 → 4851.64] his multicultural,
[4852.32 → 4853.42] diverse collection
[4853.42 → 4854.24] of misfits
[4854.24 → 4855.20] and sinners
[4855.20 → 4856.48] turned into saints.
[4856.48 → 4858.72] And if you say
[4858.72 → 4859.90] that you love Jesus,
[4860.42 → 4861.58] you will work
[4861.58 → 4862.86] then to advance
[4862.86 → 4863.80] this diverse
[4863.80 → 4865.62] body of believers
[4865.62 → 4867.08] in our unified mission
[4867.08 → 4867.64] with him,
[4867.78 → 4868.40] for him,
[4868.44 → 4869.26] and to his glory.
[4869.46 → 4870.64] The two realities
[4870.64 → 4872.20] cannot be divorced,
[4873.32 → 4873.88] the bride
[4873.88 → 4875.10] from her bridegroom
[4875.10 → 4876.44] who is Jesus.
[4876.44 → 4878.76] And so,
[4878.86 → 4879.54] let's take that back
[4879.54 → 4881.26] now to Revelation.
[4882.20 → 4883.84] When John writes,
[4883.90 → 4884.94] when Jesus says,
[4885.36 → 4886.20] yet this I hold
[4886.20 → 4886.78] against you,
[4886.84 → 4887.28] that you have
[4887.28 → 4888.98] forsaken the love
[4888.98 → 4890.16] you had at first,
[4891.02 → 4891.92] I believe
[4891.92 → 4893.16] that
[4893.16 → 4894.36] is a reference
[4894.36 → 4895.88] to the fact
[4895.88 → 4896.66] that these
[4896.66 → 4898.26] people in Ephesus,
[4898.52 → 4899.54] this church in Ephesus,
[4899.76 → 4900.94] have divorced
[4900.94 → 4901.80] themselves
[4901.80 → 4903.34] from the love
[4903.34 → 4904.24] of the body
[4904.24 → 4905.30] of Christ,
[4905.36 → 4906.00] from the love
[4906.00 → 4906.80] of the bride
[4906.80 → 4907.52] of Christ,
[4907.62 → 4907.94] the love
[4907.94 → 4908.58] of the church
[4908.58 → 4909.68] and her unity.
[4910.40 → 4911.36] And her unity
[4911.36 → 4912.82] is both internally
[4912.82 → 4913.70] and locally
[4913.70 → 4914.44] expressed
[4914.44 → 4915.48] in emphasis,
[4915.82 → 4916.62] but also
[4916.62 → 4917.82] her unity
[4917.82 → 4920.50] is transcendentally
[4920.50 → 4921.60] and universally
[4921.60 → 4922.36] expressed
[4922.36 → 4924.08] in the church
[4924.08 → 4924.84] Catholic
[4924.84 → 4925.90] all times
[4925.90 → 4927.18] and all places.
[4928.80 → 4930.08] They have forgotten
[4930.08 → 4931.92] that if you love
[4931.92 → 4932.32] Jesus,
[4932.98 → 4933.80] you must love
[4933.80 → 4934.50] his church.
[4936.00 → 4937.70] And so that begs
[4937.70 → 4938.22] the question
[4938.22 → 4938.84] for us.
[4939.40 → 4940.18] Maybe not begs,
[4940.58 → 4941.38] but I'm going to ask it.
[4941.82 → 4942.76] It asks
[4942.76 → 4943.22] for us
[4943.22 → 4943.88] in application.
[4945.40 → 4946.10] If you say
[4946.10 → 4946.98] you love Jesus,
[4947.62 → 4948.72] but you aren't
[4948.72 → 4949.70] actively loving
[4949.70 → 4950.64] his church,
[4951.18 → 4952.14] now actively loving
[4952.14 → 4952.50] his church
[4952.50 → 4953.36] might look different
[4953.36 → 4954.16] for each of you,
[4954.20 → 4954.38] right?
[4954.44 → 4954.90] It might mean
[4954.90 → 4955.64] supporting its
[4955.64 → 4956.58] ministries financially.
[4957.26 → 4958.06] It might mean
[4958.06 → 4958.60] volunteering
[4958.60 → 4959.28] in the things
[4959.28 → 4960.04] that we do
[4960.04 → 4960.58] here together.
[4960.70 → 4961.24] It might mean
[4961.24 → 4961.76] participating
[4961.76 → 4962.74] in our community
[4962.74 → 4964.06] and in community events.
[4964.06 → 4964.96] It might mean
[4964.96 → 4965.48] volunteering
[4965.48 → 4966.16] to serve
[4966.16 → 4967.00] in a particular
[4967.00 → 4967.64] capacity
[4967.64 → 4968.54] that you are
[4968.54 → 4969.20] gifted in
[4969.20 → 4970.04] or called to.
[4971.66 → 4972.96] If you aren't
[4972.96 → 4974.16] doing these things,
[4974.54 → 4975.90] but you say
[4975.90 → 4976.72] you love Jesus,
[4977.48 → 4978.02] this letter
[4978.02 → 4978.70] is for you.
[4980.36 → 4980.92] Or,
[4981.92 → 4982.70] maybe this is
[4982.70 → 4983.84] even more dangerous,
[4984.40 → 4985.34] if seemingly
[4985.34 → 4986.38] out of one side
[4986.38 → 4986.98] of your mouth
[4986.98 → 4987.80] you sing hymns
[4987.80 → 4988.72] of praise to God
[4988.72 → 4989.52] on Sunday,
[4990.02 → 4990.30] right,
[4990.46 → 4991.64] in worship together,
[4991.64 → 4992.52] but then
[4992.52 → 4993.40] on the other
[4993.40 → 4994.20] side of your mouth,
[4994.28 → 4995.12] maybe even as quickly
[4995.12 → 4996.46] as coffee afterwards,
[4996.82 → 4997.98] you are slandering
[4997.98 → 4999.22] or gossiping
[4999.22 → 5000.46] or talking back
[5000.46 → 5001.18] or bad
[5001.18 → 5002.18] about church members
[5002.18 → 5003.26] or church leadership,
[5003.78 → 5003.94] right,
[5003.98 → 5005.60] or just generally
[5005.60 → 5006.48] about church.
[5007.22 → 5008.06] But if you are not
[5008.06 → 5009.38] actively pursuing
[5009.38 → 5010.94] unity in the church,
[5011.12 → 5012.62] you are actively
[5012.62 → 5013.66] or more dangerously,
[5013.96 → 5014.60] passively
[5014.60 → 5015.46] contributing
[5015.46 → 5016.66] to disunity.
[5016.66 → 5016.80] unity.
[5022.42 → 5023.98] So hear these words
[5023.98 → 5026.30] and be careful
[5026.30 → 5028.84] because your love
[5028.84 → 5029.40] for Jesus
[5029.40 → 5031.22] will manifest
[5031.22 → 5032.48] in a love
[5032.48 → 5033.24] for his church.
[5035.20 → 5036.10] We'll give you this
[5036.10 → 5037.42] as a last word
[5037.42 → 5038.18] for us
[5038.18 → 5039.18] before we come
[5039.18 → 5039.74] to the table
[5039.74 → 5041.22] where we celebrate
[5041.22 → 5042.34] this unity,
[5042.54 → 5043.40] where we live it
[5043.40 → 5043.94] together.
[5043.94 → 5048.44] This also relates
[5048.44 → 5049.70] to that last word
[5049.70 → 5050.32] of praise
[5050.32 → 5051.04] or encouragement
[5051.04 → 5051.92] that Jesus has
[5051.92 → 5052.48] for the church
[5052.48 → 5053.74] in verse 6.
[5054.90 → 5055.94] He comes back
[5055.94 → 5056.36] and he says,
[5056.46 → 5057.20] you have this
[5057.20 → 5058.04] in your favour,
[5058.18 → 5059.34] you hate the practices
[5059.34 → 5060.92] of the Nicolai tans,
[5061.02 → 5063.02] which I also hate.
[5064.28 → 5064.48] Now,
[5064.52 → 5065.10] I'm going to be candid
[5065.10 → 5065.40] with you,
[5065.46 → 5066.12] Bible scholars
[5066.12 → 5066.86] are divided
[5066.86 → 5068.26] on exactly who
[5068.26 → 5068.84] or what
[5068.84 → 5070.06] the Nicolai tans are,
[5070.40 → 5070.78] right,
[5070.80 → 5071.42] whether they are
[5071.42 → 5072.42] a group of people
[5072.42 → 5073.10] who followed
[5073.10 → 5073.68] the teachings
[5073.68 → 5074.16] of someone
[5074.16 → 5074.94] named Nicholas
[5074.94 → 5076.56] or if they are
[5076.56 → 5077.28] a group of people
[5077.28 → 5077.60] who have been
[5077.60 → 5078.10] called that
[5078.10 → 5079.08] because the word
[5079.08 → 5079.62] in Greek,
[5079.80 → 5080.20] Nikola,
[5080.58 → 5081.74] means let us eat,
[5082.82 → 5082.94] right,
[5082.98 → 5083.82] but what scholars
[5083.82 → 5084.56] agree on
[5084.56 → 5085.88] is what's happening
[5085.88 → 5087.02] in this practice
[5087.02 → 5087.74] and in this group,
[5087.82 → 5088.52] what they taught.
[5089.08 → 5089.88] This group taught
[5089.88 → 5091.62] that it was okay
[5091.62 → 5093.10] to eat meat
[5093.10 → 5094.18] sacrificed
[5094.18 → 5095.38] to idols
[5095.38 → 5097.60] and then would
[5097.60 → 5098.52] take that
[5098.52 → 5099.50] as a further
[5099.50 → 5100.60] license
[5100.60 → 5102.10] into licentious
[5102.10 → 5102.68] behaviour.
[5102.84 → 5103.06] They would
[5103.06 → 5103.90] take that
[5103.90 → 5104.90] and turn it
[5104.90 → 5106.58] into self-indulgent
[5106.58 → 5107.44] behaviour,
[5107.58 → 5108.30] into practices
[5108.30 → 5109.28] that participated
[5109.28 → 5110.64] in idolatry.
[5111.88 → 5113.50] Clement of Alexandria,
[5114.40 → 5116.52] who is a second century,
[5116.68 → 5117.70] so very early on,
[5117.78 → 5118.56] church leader,
[5119.22 → 5119.88] he writes
[5119.88 → 5121.22] of the Nicolai tans,
[5121.34 → 5121.76] he says,
[5122.14 → 5123.64] they abandoned themselves
[5123.64 → 5124.40] to pleasure
[5124.40 → 5125.32] like goats,
[5126.28 → 5127.28] leading a life
[5127.28 → 5128.96] of self-indulgence.
[5128.96 → 5129.00] goats.
[5130.08 → 5130.96] I know some of you
[5130.96 → 5131.64] have goats
[5131.64 → 5134.16] and you know
[5134.16 → 5135.14] how easily
[5135.14 → 5135.80] they can go
[5135.80 → 5136.60] from place to place
[5136.60 → 5137.08] just taking
[5137.08 → 5137.82] whatever they have.
[5137.98 → 5138.72] If they break out
[5138.72 → 5139.24] of their pen
[5139.24 → 5140.00] into your garden,
[5140.10 → 5140.50] they will eat
[5140.50 → 5141.10] all the flowers
[5141.10 → 5142.18] off of the plants
[5142.18 → 5142.66] that you have there.
[5142.72 → 5143.74] They're self-indulgent.
[5143.82 → 5144.34] They don't care,
[5145.34 → 5145.48] right?
[5145.48 → 5145.94] If it's there,
[5146.02 → 5146.64] they're going to eat it
[5146.64 → 5147.78] and not even if it's food,
[5147.94 → 5148.10] right?
[5148.18 → 5149.32] Goats will eat paper
[5149.32 → 5150.12] and garbage
[5150.12 → 5151.28] that you leave out.
[5152.54 → 5153.46] That's what these people
[5153.46 → 5153.98] were doing,
[5154.20 → 5155.50] but their sin
[5155.50 → 5156.96] is even greater
[5156.96 → 5157.88] because they were
[5157.88 → 5159.18] encouraging others
[5159.18 → 5159.82] to do the same,
[5160.98 → 5161.16] right?
[5161.18 → 5161.86] So it's not just
[5161.86 → 5162.40] that they were eating
[5162.40 → 5163.42] meat sacrificed to idols
[5163.42 → 5163.88] because, in fact,
[5164.06 → 5164.90] you can go to Romans,
[5165.00 → 5165.42] for instance,
[5165.56 → 5166.50] and Paul will have
[5166.50 → 5167.40] a complicated argument
[5167.40 → 5167.92] about that.
[5168.12 → 5168.84] It says that in the end,
[5168.90 → 5170.18] that doesn't really matter
[5170.18 → 5171.80] because what are idols
[5171.80 → 5172.76] but wood and stone?
[5173.76 → 5174.48] What matters
[5174.48 → 5175.72] is that they are
[5175.72 → 5177.14] enticing people
[5177.14 → 5178.62] away from the truth.
[5178.70 → 5180.18] They are driving people
[5180.18 → 5181.64] into sin.
[5183.64 → 5185.62] That's the disunity
[5185.62 → 5187.72] of the Nicolai tans.
[5190.56 → 5192.56] That's the celebration.
[5192.76 → 5193.40] That's why they are
[5193.40 → 5194.52] held up again
[5194.52 → 5196.70] and why Jesus says
[5196.70 → 5197.68] he hates them
[5197.68 → 5199.82] because they're breaking
[5199.82 → 5202.32] the unity of his bride.
[5203.58 → 5205.38] Self-indulgence divides
[5205.38 → 5206.34] the church.
[5208.06 → 5209.38] Living in anticipation
[5209.38 → 5210.68] of the return of the king
[5210.68 → 5211.80] invites us to be
[5211.80 → 5213.02] a people of patient
[5213.02 → 5214.40] endurance and faith
[5214.40 → 5215.72] who can live rejoicing
[5215.72 → 5217.06] in the world to come
[5217.06 → 5218.20] and with joy
[5218.20 → 5219.24] in the world that is
[5219.24 → 5221.26] holding on to the love
[5221.26 → 5222.90] that holds on to us,
[5223.34 → 5225.04] living it boldly.
[5225.66 → 5228.22] We live this love boldly
[5228.22 → 5230.36] when we desire
[5230.36 → 5231.96] and work towards
[5231.96 → 5233.16] and maintain
[5233.16 → 5234.62] and pursue
[5234.62 → 5235.60] the unity
[5235.60 → 5237.24] of the church.
[5237.78 → 5239.78] We live this love boldly
[5239.78 → 5240.40] when we celebrate
[5240.94 → 5242.20] our diversity
[5242.20 → 5243.38] as a reflection
[5243.38 → 5245.16] of the kingdom come
[5245.16 → 5246.28] and the kingdom coming
[5246.28 → 5247.58] as the new creation
[5247.58 → 5248.72] of all nations,
[5248.96 → 5249.24] tribes,
[5249.36 → 5249.78] and tongues
[5249.78 → 5251.04] stand around
[5251.04 → 5252.72] the table of our Lord
[5252.72 → 5254.32] feasting together
[5254.32 → 5255.80] with the Lamb.
[5258.10 → 5261.14] This is who
[5261.14 → 5262.68] we are called
[5262.68 → 5263.94] to be.
[5264.98 → 5266.06] And in responding
[5266.06 → 5266.84] to that call,
[5266.94 → 5268.64] we come to this table now
[5268.64 → 5270.04] both in anticipation
[5270.04 → 5271.22] of that feast,
[5271.32 → 5273.04] but also to feed us
[5273.04 → 5275.14] and to fuel us
[5275.14 → 5276.56] towards
[5276.56 → 5278.00] that feast.
[5278.88 → 5280.22] This is the table
[5280.22 → 5280.98] around which
[5280.98 → 5281.72] we stand
[5281.72 → 5282.62] united.
[5283.56 → 5284.32] And so,
[5284.50 → 5285.32] we are going to come
[5285.32 → 5286.64] to this table together,
[5286.76 → 5287.50] which is why we've
[5287.50 → 5289.22] also invited the kids
[5289.22 → 5289.86] to come back
[5289.86 → 5290.74] and why we invite them
[5290.74 → 5291.22] to come
[5291.22 → 5292.96] so that we might come
[5292.96 → 5293.86] united
[5293.86 → 5295.24] to the table.
[5295.78 → 5296.98] So that we might have
[5296.98 → 5298.32] heard the promises
[5298.32 → 5299.64] of God given in baptism,
[5299.80 → 5300.74] we might have seen
[5300.74 → 5302.02] the call of God
[5302.02 → 5303.62] spoken in the word
[5303.62 → 5304.88] and that we might now
[5304.88 → 5306.30] live that together
[5306.30 → 5308.40] here around his table.
[5308.88 → 5309.66] Coming to the table,
[5309.78 → 5310.70] we will move through
[5310.70 → 5312.18] a liturgy together.
[5312.32 → 5312.88] There will be
[5312.88 → 5314.16] responsive portions
[5314.16 → 5315.86] on the screen behind me.
[5316.00 → 5316.62] I encourage you
[5316.62 → 5317.32] to speak that
[5317.32 → 5318.34] as we come.
[5320.00 → 5321.32] Lift your hearts.
[5322.32 → 5323.82] Give the love to the Lord.
[5323.82 → 5325.34] Let us give thanks
[5325.34 → 5326.00] to the Lord.
[5329.38 → 5330.44] Let's pray together.
[5333.50 → 5334.52] With joy,
[5334.70 → 5335.86] we praise you,
[5336.32 → 5337.02] gracious God.
[5337.86 → 5338.86] For you have created
[5338.86 → 5339.52] heaven and earth,
[5339.60 → 5340.16] have made us
[5340.16 → 5340.86] in your image,
[5340.94 → 5341.70] have kept covenant
[5341.70 → 5342.20] with us,
[5342.46 → 5343.68] even when we fell
[5343.68 → 5344.26] into sin.
[5344.98 → 5346.34] We give you thanks
[5346.34 → 5347.48] for Jesus Christ,
[5347.90 → 5349.14] who by his life,
[5349.30 → 5349.52] death,
[5349.60 → 5350.20] and resurrection
[5350.20 → 5351.34] opened to us
[5351.34 → 5352.64] the way of life
[5352.64 → 5353.70] everlasting.
[5354.80 → 5355.20] Amen.
[5358.72 → 5359.28] Jesus,
[5359.74 → 5361.12] before he suffered,
[5361.48 → 5363.20] gave us this memorial
[5363.20 → 5364.52] of his sacrifice
[5364.52 → 5366.88] until he comes again.
[5367.88 → 5368.72] The Lord Jesus,
[5368.98 → 5370.44] on the night he was betrayed,
[5371.08 → 5371.64] took bread.
[5372.46 → 5373.82] And when he had given thanks,
[5373.98 → 5375.20] he broke it and said,
[5375.36 → 5376.86] this is my body,
[5377.30 → 5378.46] which is for you.
[5379.10 → 5380.66] Do this in remembrance
[5380.66 → 5381.84] of me.
[5382.64 → 5384.58] In the same way,
[5384.80 → 5385.76] he took the cup
[5385.76 → 5386.84] after supper
[5386.84 → 5387.80] and said,
[5388.38 → 5388.90] this cup
[5388.90 → 5390.16] is the new covenant
[5390.16 → 5391.58] in my blood.
[5394.80 → 5396.08] Do this
[5396.08 → 5396.90] in remembrance
[5396.90 → 5398.12] of me.
[5399.28 → 5400.74] For whenever we eat
[5400.74 → 5401.62] this bread
[5401.62 → 5402.74] and drink
[5402.74 → 5403.66] this cup,
[5403.78 → 5404.42] we proclaim
[5404.42 → 5405.34] the Lord's death
[5405.34 → 5406.20] and resurrection
[5406.20 → 5407.68] until he comes
[5407.68 → 5408.62] again.
[5408.62 → 5412.10] this is the mystery
[5412.10 → 5413.82] of our faith.
[5414.78 → 5415.78] For the rest
[5415.78 → 5416.58] of your faith,
[5416.58 → 5416.88] we affirm
[5416.88 → 5421.68] with joy.
[5422.36 → 5423.00] You're coming,
[5423.18 → 5423.68] we await
[5423.68 → 5424.28] with hope.
[5424.94 → 5426.30] Glory be to you,
[5426.52 → 5427.00] Lord Jesus.
[5428.34 → 5429.30] Church family,
[5429.40 → 5430.74] the Lord has prepared
[5430.74 → 5431.66] his table
[5431.66 → 5432.78] for all who
[5432.78 → 5434.32] trust in him
[5434.32 → 5435.08] and all who
[5435.08 → 5436.48] love him.
[5436.48 → 5437.80] and so,
[5438.00 → 5439.04] come to this
[5439.04 → 5439.68] table,
[5440.18 → 5441.06] you who have
[5441.06 → 5441.86] much faith
[5441.86 → 5442.56] and you who
[5442.56 → 5442.98] would like
[5442.98 → 5443.64] to have more.
[5444.28 → 5445.16] Come to this
[5445.16 → 5445.44] table,
[5445.58 → 5446.10] you who have
[5446.10 → 5446.74] been to this
[5446.74 → 5447.60] sacrament often
[5447.60 → 5448.52] and you who
[5448.52 → 5449.28] have not been
[5449.28 → 5450.34] for a long time
[5450.34 → 5451.34] or you who are
[5451.34 → 5452.20] coming in faith
[5452.20 → 5453.20] for the first time.
[5453.86 → 5454.62] You who have
[5454.62 → 5455.58] tried to follow
[5455.58 → 5456.02] Jesus
[5456.02 → 5457.28] and you who
[5457.28 → 5458.44] have failed.
[5458.98 → 5459.68] Come to this
[5459.68 → 5460.40] table if you are
[5460.40 → 5461.58] here with us
[5461.58 → 5462.30] or at home
[5462.30 → 5463.42] online because
[5463.42 → 5464.32] it is Christ
[5464.32 → 5465.52] who invites
[5465.52 → 5467.04] us here.
[5467.94 → 5468.64] The gifts
[5468.64 → 5469.22] of God
[5469.22 → 5470.44] for the people
[5470.44 → 5471.52] of God.
[5472.94 → 5473.80] As we come
[5473.80 → 5474.52] to this table,
[5475.28 → 5475.92] the ushers
[5475.92 → 5476.82] are going to
[5476.82 → 5478.20] move back
[5478.20 → 5479.02] row by row
[5479.02 → 5479.70] inviting you
[5479.70 → 5480.32] to come to the
[5480.32 → 5480.56] front.
[5480.68 → 5481.06] We will then
[5481.06 → 5481.82] gather in a
[5481.82 → 5483.12] circle around
[5483.12 → 5484.96] here and we
[5484.96 → 5486.00] will pass the
[5486.00 → 5487.14] elements around
[5487.14 → 5487.78] the circle.
[5488.24 → 5489.56] As you receive

[6642.96 → 6672.94] Thank you.
[6672.96 → 6702.94] Thank you.
[6702.96 → 6732.94] Thank you.
[6732.96 → 6762.94] Thank you.
[6762.96 → 6792.94] Thank you.
[6792.96 → 6794.96] Thank you.
[6799.60 → 6803.62] We're going to end our time at the table with a prayer.
[6804.18 → 6809.30] Following that prayer, I'm going to invite Eric Van Heuser, Chair of Council, up to the front one more time.
[6809.30 → 6839.28] Let's pray together.
[6839.30 → 6843.22] We're going to join us with a mission of your holiness.
[6844.90 → 6847.42] United, we come to this table.
[6847.64 → 6850.22] United, we go on mission.
[6850.22 → 6853.46] In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[6853.46 → 6860.56] Okay.
[6860.56 → 6875.76] At this time, we're going to do a little appreciation for Sylvia.
[6875.76 → 6879.28] But before I call her up, I have one other announcement from Council for everyone.
[6879.28 → 6884.00] As was mentioned, has been mentioned every week, usually in December, as we get close
[6884.00 → 6885.00] to the end of the year.
[6885.00 → 6890.12] We just want to encourage everyone to make sure that your givings are up and that we
[6890.12 → 6894.62] can make sure that we are fulfilling our budget obligations for the year.
[6894.62 → 6898.80] So we'd like to give you a reminder for that at this time of the year.
[6898.80 → 6903.20] But what we really want to do right now is invite Sylvie up front here for a brief little
[6903.20 → 6906.26] moment.
[6906.26 → 6912.62] For those of you who don't know, Sylvia is retiring from being our church administrator.
[6912.62 → 6917.36] So if you walked in this morning, and you're wondering why the cake's out there, we're going
[6917.36 → 6921.96] to have a little bit of time of appreciation for Sylvia.
[6921.96 → 6926.30] Sylvia, we just want to thank you on behalf of Council and everyone here for your eight
[6926.30 → 6928.16] and a half year of service.
[6928.16 → 6932.20] Through those times, I'm sure, especially the last couple of years with COVID, I'm sure
[6932.20 → 6939.52] it was difficult dealing with changing pastors, changing chairs of council.
[6939.52 → 6944.26] The last one's a real piece, but that's okay.
[6944.26 → 6947.26] I just want to thank you for your time and your appreciation.
[6947.26 → 6954.00] And I brought, we got you this beautiful bouquet of flowers that we want to give to you.
[6954.00 → 6958.64] As well, we thought we would get you a gift.
[6958.64 → 6964.20] And I did a lot of research and I decided that I would go way out on a limb here and get you
[6964.20 → 6967.94] one of these.
[6967.94 → 6973.94] But before I give you this, as you can see, I didn't get a vase for the flowers because
[6973.94 → 6975.26] I went all out on this.
[6975.26 → 6977.26] I blew the budget on this fishing rod here.
[6977.26 → 6983.50] But I figured you'd have a vase at home.
[6983.50 → 6987.98] I went to the best fishing store in town, Mc Frugal's.
[6987.98 → 6990.26] And I bought this expensive fishing rod.
[6990.26 → 6991.26] And I bought this expensive fishing rod.
[6991.26 → 6995.26] It comes with a little bit of an oath and vow you have to make to it.
[6995.26 → 7000.26] So I would like you to repeat after me if you don't mind.
[7000.26 → 7007.26] I, Sylvia, take you this fishing rod as my retirement friend.
[7007.26 → 7013.26] I, Sylvia, take you this fishing rod as my retirement friend.
[7013.26 → 7014.26] And you don't have.
[7014.26 → 7015.48] I will love you.
[7015.48 → 7016.86] DEP смотреть
[7016.86 → 7017.98] I will love you.
[7017.98 → 7020.92] I will cherish you.
[7020.92 → 7022.26] I will cherish you.
[7022.62 → 7026.10] I will take good care of you.
[7026.10 → 7028.00] I will take good care of you.
[7028.00 → 7035.04] When your time is done fishing rod, I will retire you graciously.
[7035.04 → 7037.44] When your time is done near fishing
[7037.44 → 7040.34] rod, I will retire you graciously.
[7040.34 → 7045.74] I will not lie about any situation that involves this fishing rod.
[7045.74 → 7050.52] I will not lie about any situation that involves this fishing rod.
[7050.52 → 7055.38] I will not exaggerate any situation that involves this fishing rod.
[7055.38 → 7060.30] I will not exaggerate any situation that involves this fishing rod.
[7060.30 → 7063.52] Only truth and honesty will be spoken.
[7063.52 → 7066.86] Only truth and honesty will be spoken.
[7066.86 → 7072.54] And finally, I will be a great partner to my husband who will want me to go fishing more now that I am retired.
[7077.88 → 7082.30] I will be a great partner to my husband who will want to go fishing more.
[7083.42 → 7085.78] Well done. I present you this fishing rod.
[7086.24 → 7088.26] Thank you very much. Round of applause. Thank you.
[7096.86 → 7097.86] Thank you.
[7102.86 → 7108.00] Does anyone else remember when Homer Simpson gave Marge a bowling ball that said Homer on it?
[7110.22 → 7111.78] Frank, did you have a hand in that gift?
[7114.90 → 7116.02] It would have been a... Oh.
[7117.52 → 7119.00] Eric, he's telling you how to do your job.
[7120.72 → 7122.78] We do want to say thank you, Sylvia.
[7123.20 → 7126.66] As staff, we have organized a separate time for that,
[7126.66 → 7129.06] so I won't take any more of our time this morning,
[7129.26 → 7135.26] except to make sure you hear the invitation to stick around for cake and to congratulate Sylvia.
[7135.38 → 7141.42] One of the things she loves most is when people queue up to fill her next 45 minutes with personal interaction and time.
[7141.60 → 7143.28] So make sure you do that well.
[7144.38 → 7149.40] I'm going to invite you as you are able to stand, and we can receive God's blessing today.
[7156.66 → 7162.04] We go with God who goes with us, and we go together.
[7163.04 → 7165.00] Receive the blessing of God.
[7166.26 → 7169.00] God, go before you to prepare a way for you.
[7169.48 → 7172.02] God, go behind you to protect you.
[7172.62 → 7174.68] God, go beneath you to support you.
[7174.76 → 7177.64] And God, go beside you to befriend you.
[7177.64 → 7179.32] Do not be afraid.
[7179.76 → 7181.72] Let the blessing of God come upon you today.
[7181.84 → 7188.40] Do not be afraid, but go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
[7189.40 → 7190.04] Amen.
[7190.04 → 7190.12] Amen.
