[597.24 → 599.24] Thank you.
[623.24 → 629.24] Good morning.
[629.24 → 634.90] Good morning. How are we doing?
[637.54 → 643.06] Three or four of you are doing well. The rest of you are deep in conversation. Awesome. I'll wait.
[652.10 → 654.10] This is a game of who gets uncomfortable first.
[654.10 → 664.40] Welcome to worship. We're so glad that you are here with us this morning, whether you are here in person or if you're joining us online.
[664.60 → 674.48] Welcome to Emanuel Church. My name is Chris. I'm one of the pastors here, and it's my privilege, along with these others, to lead in worship this morning.
[675.06 → 681.20] Before we begin, in earnest, we have a couple announcements to make, and so I'm going to invite Josh to make his way up to the front here for his announcement.
[681.20 → 696.18] While he's coming, I will simply say that after service today is youth coffee and that's for high school aged people, and they're going to the Star's house after service.
[696.36 → 701.16] And so chat with some friends for a few minutes and then be prepared to make your way over there.
[701.16 → 707.58] Later this afternoon, so after youth coffee, is pastor's class, which I lead.
[707.84 → 718.26] Now, pastor's class is for those who are wondering about making profession of faith or wondering about becoming a member here in our church.
[718.36 → 721.78] And so if that's something you're interested in, you can still sign up for that.
[721.78 → 729.30] You can talk to me after service today, but we will meet here around 2 for that class and that time together.
[730.56 → 731.40] Go ahead, Josh.
[732.50 → 737.94] I'm just up here to remind the young adults that tonight at 7 p.m. is board games night at the church at 7 p.m.
[739.52 → 743.76] Bring a board game that you think that a lot of people would like to play or a bunch of board games.
[744.20 → 746.48] Snacks will be provided, and we're going to have fun.
[746.48 → 753.36] I always wonder if someone brings risk, do you have to commit for like the eight hours that it takes to play that game?
[754.08 → 754.56] Yes.
[754.70 → 754.96] Okay.
[755.78 → 756.72] Appreciate that.
[757.32 → 765.82] And then finally, next weekend, we are hosting a worship leaders conference here on Friday and Saturday.
[766.40 → 771.46] And so that's primarily for those of you who are involved in the worship ministry of this church.
[771.46 → 776.02] And so we really want to encourage you, even ask you to sign up for that.
[776.22 → 788.86] But more generally, if you're looking for a time to gather together and to learn about community life and faith, to learn about worship as Christians, this is an opportunity to do that.
[789.12 → 792.74] Sign up can be linked from the e-bulletin or on our church website.
[792.90 → 793.68] You can find it there.
[793.78 → 795.20] It's on social media in different places.
[795.20 → 797.94] Or you can ask me for questions or details about that.
[797.94 → 803.36] But we want to encourage you to do that and then also invite your friends and family and the like for that event.
[804.64 → 807.34] I believe that's everything.
[807.96 → 808.70] Let's stand.
[809.06 → 812.86] We can enter into God's presence together in worship.
[815.08 → 820.14] Encourage you to open your heart and receive the greeting of God.
[820.14 → 833.54] Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son, and our Saviour, through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[834.80 → 835.20] Amen.
[835.88 → 836.98] Let's glorify God together.
[836.98 → 841.56] Our call to worship this morning is from Psalm 96.
[842.56 → 842.96] It says,
[842.96 → 844.56] Sing to the Lord a new song.
[844.94 → 846.52] Sing to the Lord all the earth.
[847.12 → 848.98] Sing to the Lord and praise his name.
[849.22 → 851.48] Proclaim his salvation day after day.
[852.12 → 856.18] Declare his glory among the nations, his marvellous deeds among the people.
[856.84 → 859.56] For great is the Lord and most worthy of praise.
[859.78 → 861.94] He is to be feared above all gods.
[861.94 → 882.80] I will worship.
[882.80 → 885.18] I will worship.
[885.18 → 888.00] With all of my heart.
[888.00 → 890.52] With all of my heart.
[890.52 → 893.24] I will praise you.
[893.26 → 895.38] I will praise you.
[895.38 → 897.80] With all of my strength.
[898.12 → 899.84] All my strength.
[900.42 → 902.80] I will seek you.
[902.84 → 904.96] I will seek you.
[905.20 → 907.28] All of my days.
[907.58 → 909.60] All of my days.
[909.88 → 911.76] I will follow.
[912.26 → 914.04] I will follow.
[914.04 → 916.68] All of your grace.
[916.96 → 919.00] All your ways.
[919.00 → 921.48] I will give you.
[921.48 → 923.70] I will give you all my worship.
[923.70 → 928.88] I will give you all my praise.
[928.88 → 933.02] You alone I long to worship.
[933.74 → 938.00] You alone are worthy of my name.
[938.00 → 945.10] And I will bow down.
[945.10 → 947.28] And hail you as king.
[947.28 → 949.62] And I will serve you.
[949.68 → 951.44] I will serve you.
[951.44 → 953.54] And give you everything.
[953.54 → 956.30] And give you everything.
[956.30 → 958.96] And I will lift.
[958.98 → 960.98] I will lift.
[960.98 → 965.32] My eyes to your throne.
[965.32 → 968.22] I will trust you.
[970.50 → 972.28] Trust you alone.
[975.62 → 979.38] I will give you all my worship.
[980.38 → 984.58] I will give you all my praise.
[984.90 → 988.54] You alone I long to worship.
[988.54 → 993.92] You alone are worthy of my praise.
[993.92 → 997.76] I will give you all my worship.
[998.58 → 1002.52] I will give you all my praise.
[1003.22 → 1006.88] You alone I long to worship.
[1007.78 → 1012.80] You alone are worthy of my praise.

[1033.30 → 1035.30] You alone are worthy of my praise.
[1035.30 → 1040.68] You alone are worthy of my praise.
[1040.68 → 1049.06] Your love, O Lord, reaches to the heavens.
[1049.06 → 1068.44] Your righteousness is like the mighty mountain.
[1068.44 → 1073.82] You alone are worthy of my praise.
[1073.82 → 1079.66] Your justice flows like the ocean's tide.
[1079.66 → 1085.04] You alone are worthy of my praise.
[1085.04 → 1090.42] You alone are worthy of my praise.
[1090.42 → 1093.80] I will find the high strength.
[1093.80 → 1094.42] I will find the high strength.
[1094.42 → 1098.80] In the shadow of your wings.
[1098.80 → 1099.86] You alone are worthy of my praise.
[1099.86 → 1101.96] You alone are worthy of my praise.
[1101.96 → 1102.06] You alone are worthy of my praise.
[1102.06 → 1106.80] Your love, O Lord, reaches to the heaven.
[1106.80 → 1118.92] Your faithfulness stretches to the sky.
[1118.92 → 1127.72] Your righteousness is like a mighty mountain
[1127.72 → 1137.72] Your justice flows like the ocean's tide
[1137.72 → 1146.80] I will lift my high voice to worship you, my King
[1146.80 → 1157.32] I will find my high strength in the shadow of your wings
[1157.32 → 1166.40] I will lift my high voice to worship you, my King
[1166.40 → 1176.20] And I will find my high strength in the shadow of your wings
[1176.20 → 1185.72] Your love, O Lord, reaches to the heavens
[1185.72 → 1195.72] Your faithfulness stretches to the sky
[1195.72 → 1225.72] 
[1225.72 → 1229.98] And it's so easy to forget the sound of your voice when we don't spend time with you
[1229.98 → 1233.48] O Lord, forgive us for straying from you
[1233.48 → 1237.52] For not spending time in your presence every day in fellowship with you
[1237.52 → 1242.20] And instead, indulging in the pleasures and the fickle promises of this world
[1242.20 → 1244.76] You are my hiding place
[1244.76 → 1247.12] You will protect me from trouble
[1247.12 → 1249.62] And surround me with songs of deliverance
[1249.62 → 1251.90] Lead us into your presence, Lord
[1251.90 → 1254.72] Remind us to set aside time for you
[1254.72 → 1259.32] That we may look to you for counsel, for help, and follow your leading
[1259.32 → 1261.42] In your name we pray
[1261.42 → 1285.94] You are my hiding place
[1285.94 → 1295.04] You always fill my heart with songs of deliverance
[1295.04 → 1301.18] Whenever I am afraid, I will trust in you
[1301.18 → 1302.18] You always fill my heart with songs of deliverance
[1302.18 → 1308.84] I will trust in you
[1308.84 → 1311.88] That we may say I will trust in you
[1311.88 → 1313.12] That we may say I will trust in you
[1313.12 → 1314.86] Whenever I am afraid, I will trust in you
[1314.86 → 1319.88] Whenever I am afraid, I will trust in you
[1319.88 → 1321.86] You are my hiding place
[1321.86 → 1337.64] I am strong in the truth of the friend.
[1337.64 → 1340.44] I will trust in you.
[1341.72 → 1344.70] I will trust in you.
[1344.70 → 1346.98] You always will.
[1346.98 → 1355.08] Let the weak say I am strong in your strength.
[1355.08 → 1359.48] Of the Lord, I will trust in you.
[1361.24 → 1364.50] I will trust in you.
[1365.96 → 1375.78] Let the weak say I am strong in the strength of the Lord.
[1375.78 → 1378.66] And I will trust in you.
[1378.66 → 1383.66] Let the weak say I am strong in the strength of the Lord.
[1383.66 → 1384.92] Not important.
[1384.92 → 1387.54] No part of this card I know will trust in me.
[1387.62 → 1390.66] I am strong in strength.

[1928.68 → 1930.68] Hank, honk your nose!
[1930.68 → 1931.68] Huh?
[1931.68 → 1932.68] Honk your nose!
[1932.68 → 1933.68] Yeah, I have to do it for you!
[1933.68 → 1934.68] I can't!
[1934.68 → 1939.68] All right, so, we're going to go to children's worship time, because there's a command that
[1939.68 → 1943.68] Jesus gave us before he ascended to heaven, and that's going to be our story today.
[1943.68 → 1947.68] So, we're going to hear about his command to us, and see if we can follow that command,
[1947.68 → 1949.68] just like Hank followed all of these.
[1949.68 → 1950.68] Good idea!
[1950.68 → 1951.68] Should I bring Hank, maybe?
[1951.68 → 1952.68] Maybe Hank can help us out back there.
[1952.68 → 1953.68] Yeah!
[1953.68 → 1954.68] Should I do that?
[1954.68 → 1955.68] You want to come, Hank?
[1955.68 → 1956.68] Yeah!
[1956.68 → 1957.68] I want to.
[1957.68 → 1958.68] He's going to come with us, okay?
[1958.68 → 1959.68] Okay!
[1959.68 → 1962.68] Well, I think I'm going to hold him, because otherwise there's going to be riots in the
[1962.68 → 1963.68] streets.
[1963.68 → 1964.68] Make something, Hank.
[1964.68 → 1965.68] What's that?
[1965.68 → 1966.68] Make something?
[1966.68 → 1967.68] We'll see if you can do it in the back, okay?
[1967.68 → 1968.68] First, let's pray.
[1968.68 → 1970.68] Let's pray, and then we'll go in the back, we'll talk more, okay?
[1970.68 → 1971.68] All right.
[1971.68 → 1972.68] Let's pray.
[1972.68 → 1973.68] Dear God, thank you so much for this day.
[1973.68 → 1976.68] Thank you that we could be in church today, and that we could worship you here, and learn
[1976.68 → 1978.68] more about what it is to follow you.
[1978.68 → 1982.68] We pray that you'll be with us kids as we head to the back, and learn about this wonderful
[1982.68 → 1985.68] command that you gave us before you went to heaven.
[1985.68 → 1987.68] And we pray for those who are staying back here in the sanctuary.
[1987.68 → 1989.68] May they learn more about you as well.
[1989.68 → 1990.68] We pray this in your name.
[1990.68 → 1991.68] Amen.
[1991.68 → 1992.68] All right.
[1992.68 → 1993.68] We're going to do the children's blessing first.
[1993.68 → 1995.68] Oh, see you, Malachi.
[1995.68 → 1996.68] All right.
[1996.68 → 1997.68] Stand up.
[1997.68 → 1998.68] Stand up.
[1998.68 → 1999.68] Stand up.
[1999.68 → 2002.68] So what we do is we put our hands like this, and we look at the church, and then we
[2002.68 → 2004.68] put them down, and we say, the Lord be with you, okay?
[2004.68 → 2005.68] So let's all look out there.
[2005.68 → 2006.68] Hank will do it too.
[2006.68 → 2007.68] Hank will do it too.
[2007.68 → 2009.68] Okay, let's look out there, and let's say it together.
[2009.68 → 2011.68] The Lord be with you.
[2011.68 → 2013.68] And also with you.
[2013.68 → 2016.68] Okay, let's head to the children's worship time room.
[2016.68 → 2039.68] Good morning.
[2039.68 → 2044.68] My name is Ken, and I'm an elder here at Emanuel Christian Forum Church.
[2044.68 → 2048.68] And this morning, I will be leading us in our church family prayer.
[2048.68 → 2051.68] First, a couple brief announcements.
[2051.68 → 2054.68] Next week, we will be sharing in the Lord's Supper.
[2054.68 → 2059.68] So take time this week to reflect on that, prepare your hearts, talk to your kids and
[2059.68 → 2064.68] your families about that, and we will gather around the table next week.
[2064.68 → 2071.68] Also, we are in the nomination process still for additional elders and deacons for council,
[2071.68 → 2073.68] and we're still looking for additional nominations.
[2073.68 → 2079.68] So you are encouraged to grab a form at the back table in the foyer if you have someone
[2079.68 → 2084.68] that you have thought of nominating, and connect with them and go through the nomination process
[2084.68 → 2087.68] as outlined on the form and also in your e-bulletins.
[2087.68 → 2094.68] Yeah, at this point, we will turn to our Lord in prayer as a congregation together.
[2094.68 → 2103.68] Our Father in heaven, how good it is to be here together today to worship and meet with you as your people.
[2103.68 → 2106.68] As we have just sung, I surrender all.
[2106.68 → 2110.68] Today, in this time, Lord, we surrender our needs to you.
[2110.68 → 2113.68] We surrender our Thanksgiving to you and our praise to you.
[2113.68 → 2122.68] All that we have comes from you, and you live through us and are the one to get credit for all that we have in our lives.
[2122.68 → 2131.68] And Lord, we thank you for the gift of salvation that you bring into our lives and that you enable us to be your people and to be your church.
[2131.68 → 2140.68] Lord, we thank you for all those in our midst who have special needs and special challenges at this time as well.
[2140.68 → 2149.68] Lord, we pray for the family from Columbia that was with us for the last couple of weeks, Sebastian, Sandy, Sarah, and Julieta, as they have left for Vancouver.
[2149.68 → 2154.68] Lord, thank you for the opportunity we have had to be part of their lives and part of their story.
[2154.68 → 2161.68] And now we ask God that you lead them and help them find a permanent place and you're calling on their lives here in Canada.
[2161.68 → 2169.68] We pray, Lord, for all those in our congregation who are going through different change, whether it be college and university students whose semester just ended
[2169.68 → 2176.68] and who may be travelling and have been graduating or are currently graduating, and some who are staying where they were going to school.
[2176.68 → 2180.68] Lord, please show them your will for their lives.
[2180.68 → 2188.68] We pray for people who are in our congregation who have had new marriages, new children, new different family events.
[2188.68 → 2197.68] Lord, we pray that you would help them to grow and to adjust and to be able to turn to you for all their strength and all their needs.
[2197.68 → 2210.68] Lord, we pray for those who have had struggles with family situations, Lord, with being estranged from loved ones or from broken marriages.
[2210.68 → 2216.68] Lord, help us to lean on you and to count on you to help and restore us.
[2216.68 → 2220.68] Lord, we seek your calling in all of our lives.
[2220.68 → 2229.68] Some of us are on the outside looking like we have things together and stable, and yet there's always struggles internally, Lord.
[2229.68 → 2239.68] And I pray that you would just help us to turn to you for guidance, whether it be to continue on the path we're on or to find the calling that you have set out for us.
[2239.68 → 2250.68] Lord, I pray for our church, for the denomination, for the Christian Reformed Church, as CRC Canada has a new transitional executive director, Al Postman.
[2250.68 → 2257.68] Lord, bless Reverend Postman with what he needs to do this challenging and important work at this challenging time.
[2257.68 → 2268.68] Lord, thank you for the work that our pastor, Pastor Chris, was able to do in contributing to the search committee to enable Pastor Al to be brought into this position.
[2268.68 → 2279.68] Lord, I pray now that you would continue on with the work of the CRC through him and that our church would be vibrant and be the body of Christ to the world around us.
[2279.68 → 2282.68] Lord, we pray for our world.
[2282.68 → 2287.68] Lord, we pray for all the challenges and difficulties that are currently lingering.
[2287.68 → 2295.68] We pray for the ongoing effects of the pandemic we've been through and that's still going, for those who have health concerns related to it,
[2295.68 → 2301.68] and for those who are struggling with different challenges that came through the response.
[2301.68 → 2305.68] Lord, we pray for the people in Ukraine and for the war that's going on.
[2305.68 → 2312.68] There are so many refugees stuck in beseeched places like Mariupol and who have left the country as well.
[2312.68 → 2318.68] God, we ask that you be with all of them, especially the children who are suffering as this crisis deteriorates.
[2318.68 → 2324.68] For those who are anxious and fearful and for those who are injured, who have been bereaved, who have lost their lives.
[2324.68 → 2331.68] Lord, we ask that you would continue to be the one that we turn to for strength.
[2331.68 → 2338.68] And also, Lord, that you would stir the hearts of people who are in leadership and who have the position to be able to affect change.
[2338.68 → 2341.68] And ultimately, Lord, that you would help bring peace.
[2341.68 → 2344.68] We pray for people who are struggling with their health.
[2344.68 → 2348.68] Lord, whether it's physical health, we ask that you would heal their bodies.
[2348.68 → 2354.68] Lord, for those who struggle with mental health, with anxiety and depression, it's so prevalent, Lord.
[2354.68 → 2363.68] We all have these challenges at times, and we ask God that you would change our minds and change our hearts and heal us of these ailments.
[2363.68 → 2380.68] Lord, for those who are struggling with different concerns, for some, the current situation economically can be anxiety-provoking with inflation change and interest rates, supply chain uncertainties, and all these different changes that keep happening around us.
[2380.68 → 2385.68] Lord, when there's change in our world, the one thing we can rely on is that you never change.
[2385.68 → 2390.68] Your faith and your grace and your faithfulness is never ailing, Lord.
[2390.68 → 2395.68] And we pray that you would help us to turn and rely on you for that.
[2395.68 → 2398.68] Lord, we also pray for Emmanuel Church.
[2398.68 → 2400.68] Among us here, we have our leadership and our staff.
[2400.68 → 2410.68] We pray as we're going through the elder and deacon nomination process that you would stir the hearts of those that you would call to serve to step forward for that call.
[2410.68 → 2418.68] And we also ask that you would encourage us to reach out and to nominate our brothers and sisters that we feel would be good to serve in your church.
[2418.68 → 2429.68] And Lord, we pray now as we go into the service and as we have your message preached to us, that we would be able to hear your word and grow and change through it.
[2429.68 → 2434.68] And that through us, we could grow your church and change the world, Lord.
[2434.68 → 2439.68] And that you would continue to work in our lives and through our lives in all we do.
[2439.68 → 2446.68] We pray this in Jesus name. Amen.
[2446.68 → 2448.68] Thanks, Kevin.
[2448.68 → 2449.68] Thanks, Kevin.
[2459.68 → 2466.68] This morning, we're going to jump back into the book of Exodus one more time.
[2466.68 → 2473.68] So we're going to end off the series that we've been doing with this last message together.
[2473.68 → 2476.68] We're going to read from Exodus 34.
[2476.68 → 2480.68] So I encourage you, if you have a Bible to open it up, find Exodus 34.
[2480.68 → 2483.68] Exodus is the second book of the Bible.
[2483.68 → 2487.68] So if you start at the beginning and start turning pages, you'll get there pretty quickly.
[2487.68 → 2493.68] We're going to read from Exodus 34, starting at verse 29 through the end of that chapter there.
[2493.68 → 2502.68] It will be on the screen, but I do encourage you, as always, to have your own Bible and keep that handy as we look and make reference and jump around together.
[2502.68 → 2508.68] Let's read from Exodus 34.
[2508.68 → 2515.68] When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the covenant law in his hands,
[2515.68 → 2521.68] he was not aware that his face was radiant because he had spoken with the Lord.
[2521.68 → 2528.68] When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, his face was radiant, and they were afraid to come near him.
[2528.68 → 2532.68] But Moses called to them.
[2532.68 → 2537.68] And so Aaron and all the leaders of the community came back to him, and he spoke to them.
[2537.68 → 2545.68] Afterward, all the Israelites came near him, and he gave them all the commands the Lord had given him on Mount Sinai.
[2545.68 → 2550.68] When Moses finished speaking to them, he put a veil over his face.
[2550.68 → 2557.68] But whenever he entered the Lord's presence to speak with him, he removed the veil until he came out.
[2557.68 → 2564.68] And when he came out and told the Israelites what had been commanded, they saw his face was radiant.
[2564.68 → 2571.68] Then Moses would put the veil back over his face until he went in to speak with the Lord.
[2571.68 → 2574.68] This is the word of the Lord.
[2574.68 → 2586.68] Okay, I want to begin this morning with a little bit of a test of your consumer knowledge.
[2586.68 → 2591.68] So I'm going to start a slogan, a line, and I want you to finish it.
[2591.68 → 2592.68] Okay.
[2592.68 → 2596.68] Maybe she's born with it.
[2596.68 → 2598.68] Maybe it's Maybelline.
[2598.68 → 2599.68] All right.
[2599.68 → 2600.68] This side is stronger so far.
[2600.68 → 2601.68] You guys got work to do here.
[2601.68 → 2602.68] All right.
[2602.68 → 2605.68] You're richer than you think.
[2605.68 → 2606.68] All right.
[2606.68 → 2607.68] Point for Scotia Bank.
[2607.68 → 2608.68] That's my bank, by the way.
[2608.68 → 2609.68] Scotia.
[2609.68 → 2610.68] Let's talk.
[2610.68 → 2614.68] Dream to the max.
[2614.68 → 2617.68] Oh, that's the lottery one.
[2617.68 → 2618.68] Hmm.
[2618.68 → 2619.68] Right.
[2619.68 → 2630.68] Between meme culture and social media and advertising, we are inundated with all sorts of messages from the culture that we live in.
[2630.68 → 2641.68] So much so that even if you haven't consciously paid attention to a TV commercial or a meme for the last 20 years of your life, you knew those lines.
[2641.68 → 2643.68] Because that's how they work.
[2643.68 → 2651.68] They creep their way in, and they shape us, and they define us, and eventually they come to define what we believe it means to be human.
[2651.68 → 2655.68] What we think life is really all about.
[2655.68 → 2659.68] We're going to throw something up on the screen there, and you can see some of them.
[2659.68 → 2666.68] Now, seeing those things behind me, we're not going to read all of them, of course.
[2666.68 → 2677.68] You can as I talk here, but let me put it in a language that you may be more familiar with since you're sitting here in church on Sunday, or you're watching online or maybe later in the week.
[2677.68 → 2690.68] Seven days a week, from the moment that you wake up and look at your phone or turn on the radio or ask Alexa to play your favourite music or for Siri to give you your daily news briefing.
[2690.68 → 2706.68] Seven days a week, whether you open Instagram or TikTok, YouTube or Twitter, these pop-cultural prophets are speaking a gospel message to us that promises a good life, a meaningful life, a full life.
[2706.68 → 2710.68] If we only but followed our hearts.
[2710.68 → 2722.68] These are the gospel messages we hear six or seven days a week and try as we might, they creep their way into our thinking, into our desiring, into our living and our loving.
[2722.68 → 2733.68] Every waking moment we are told, overcome and overwhelmed by ideas that the world is all about me.
[2733.68 → 2740.68] My life, my stuff, my status, my power, another church word, my glory.
[2740.68 → 2748.68] And then, for an hour on Sunday morning, an hour and a half maybe, we come here.
[2748.68 → 2751.68] We have a chance to hear something different.
[2751.68 → 2759.68] Now, however many hours of the week that we hear these other messages, we have an hour and a half together to try and hear a different one.
[2759.68 → 2761.68] To hear something different.
[2761.68 → 2764.68] Now, maybe you come here looking for something different.
[2764.68 → 2771.68] Maybe you come here this morning looking for something that lasts, something that's real, something that will fill your hearts.
[2771.68 → 2778.68] That having even one of these other messages just can't seem to do.
[2778.68 → 2784.68] In short, we come here looking for God.
[2784.68 → 2793.68] I was talking to a guy recently who had just started for a couple of months in his journey of faith and church.
[2793.68 → 2803.68] And prior to this time in his life, he was a relatively young man, his whole life had been driven by the idea of wealth and status.
[2803.68 → 2811.68] The power that came from what would one day be his sort of C-suite position in life as a CEO of a large company.
[2811.68 → 2816.68] But his ideas of life and meaning were beginning to change, beginning to shift.
[2816.68 → 2823.68] And he didn't quite yet have the vocab or the experience to make sense of it.
[2823.68 → 2831.68] And as we talked, he told me about all his pursuits of wealth, his chasing after women and drink and drugs.
[2831.68 → 2836.68] And really, by all outward accounts, by the standards of society, he had made it.
[2836.68 → 2840.68] Right? He was not yet 30. He was making six figures in salary.
[2840.68 → 2844.68] In fact, for some of you, this is really on point here.
[2844.68 → 2850.68] This is how wealthy he was. He owned a house.
[2850.68 → 2864.68] And as we talked, he started to convey that all of that stuff just wasn't feeling right to him or wasn't feeling the satisfactory to him.
[2864.68 → 2871.68] His satisfaction with everything that was previously bringing him meaning and purpose in life just didn't do it anymore.
[2871.68 → 2876.68] His joy in the former things didn't get him as up as it used to.
[2876.68 → 2882.68] And as we talked, he started communicating a longing that he couldn't quite put into words.
[2882.68 → 2888.68] It was fascinating to watch him process this. A longing for something more.
[2888.68 → 2907.68] And as I listened, I couldn't help but think of the words of St. Augustine, who's a fourth century church father from North Africa, who says that you have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our heart is restless until it rests in you.
[2907.68 → 2916.68] And as I shared those words with him, the past few months of his life just sort of became clearer.
[2916.68 → 2924.68] Right? He understood, or at least was getting the vocabulary to understand, something deep within him, a longing that he couldn't before express.
[2924.68 → 2938.68] Right? The truth of human life is that real satisfaction is only truly, meaningfully, genuinely found in the glory of God, in glorifying God.
[2938.68 → 2943.68] And that is what this text is about in Exodus 34.
[2943.68 → 2947.68] That's really what our whole series in Exodus has been about.
[2947.68 → 2955.68] Right? It is only in and out of a relationship to God that your life becomes radiant.
[2955.68 → 2960.68] Right? Glory in God, and then you will have the good life.
[2960.68 → 2964.68] Contrary to what the fitness institution might want to tell you.
[2964.68 → 2969.68] Even when it's not actually good or easy, or even when you're not actually rich,
[2969.68 → 2974.68] there's something about experiencing the glory of God that transcends all these other things.
[2974.68 → 2986.68] That's the freedom, to put it in our Exodus series language, of being taken out of captivity to these other things and into covenant, into relationship with God.
[2986.68 → 2992.68] Now, as we read the story of Moses coming down from a mountaintop experience of God,
[2992.68 → 2998.68] we have to remember that Moses' story doesn't start on that mountaintop.
[2998.68 → 3009.68] We find Moses here after almost a lifetime of experiences and questions and doubts and wandering, literally and metaphorically.
[3009.68 → 3013.68] In lots of ways, right, Moses' journey is sort of archetypal.
[3013.68 → 3015.68] It's a pattern of our own.
[3015.68 → 3019.68] Moses is a stand-in for our stories.
[3019.68 → 3024.68] Not to overstate the case, but we are all like Moses.
[3024.68 → 3033.68] Now, I say that, and I know that, well, I'm assuming, actually, that none of you were born and put in a basket and then put down the Fraser River at some point in your life, right?
[3033.68 → 3040.68] Nobody here, at least to my knowledge, if you were, then let's talk, was born in a royal home, right?
[3040.68 → 3049.68] Few of us have experienced the privilege and the status that comes from an upbringing that, like, that kind of upbringing could afford.
[3049.68 → 3056.68] I'm also, I'll say 98% confident that nobody here has killed a man coming to the defence of another person
[3056.68 → 3061.68] and then run out of that life of privilege into the foothills and wandering of the Egyptian wilderness.
[3061.68 → 3066.68] Again, if that's your story, I want to hear it too, so grab me after.
[3066.68 → 3071.68] When I say we're all like Moses, I don't mean that we've all had the same experiences of Moses.
[3071.68 → 3075.68] I mean that we've had similar thoughts and struggles and doubts.
[3075.68 → 3082.68] Because you see, when it comes to Moses' faith in God, Moses started at the bottom, and he worked his way up.
[3082.68 → 3087.68] And so maybe you're on the mountaintop of your faith and relationship to God right now.
[3087.68 → 3090.68] But you all know you didn't start there.
[3090.68 → 3097.68] Maybe you're at the beginning of a relationship of, and faith, and with God.
[3097.68 → 3099.68] But I promise you this, right?
[3099.68 → 3106.68] If you pursue God's glory with a diligence, the same diligence that you pursued your degree with,
[3106.68 → 3113.68] or the same diligence that you pursue that promotion with, or that same diligence and intentionality that you pursued your spouse with,
[3113.68 → 3118.68] I promise you, if you pursue God that way, you will not be left at the beginning.
[3118.68 → 3122.68] Maybe you've been in this journey for a while, but now you want something more.
[3122.68 → 3125.68] Your heart is stirring.
[3125.68 → 3127.68] God wants to take you there.
[3127.68 → 3135.68] By the time we get to the story that we read this morning, Moses has been on a 40-year journey.
[3135.68 → 3136.68] Right?
[3136.68 → 3140.68] And when we read this text, don't forget where Moses started.
[3140.68 → 3146.68] Because he started his journey timid and afraid and utterly incapable.
[3146.68 → 3147.68] Right?
[3147.68 → 3154.68] Maybe you recall the story, but in Exodus 3, you can read that Moses was wandering in the wilderness after he had fled from Egypt.
[3154.68 → 3158.68] And there was a bush that was burning and would not be consumed.
[3158.68 → 3161.68] And God spoke to him there at that moment.
[3161.68 → 3166.68] God spoke to Moses and called him to what was an impossible task.
[3166.68 → 3169.68] And how did Moses respond?
[3169.68 → 3170.68] Right?
[3170.68 → 3173.68] He said, I can't.
[3173.68 → 3175.68] I don't speak good.
[3175.68 → 3176.68] I can't do that.
[3176.68 → 3179.68] I don't have the presence or the power.
[3179.68 → 3184.68] The people won't even listen to me, let alone that Pharaoh guy.
[3184.68 → 3189.68] That's the Moses we know to be in us.
[3189.68 → 3190.68] Right?
[3190.68 → 3193.68] We've all felt inadequate and unable and incapable.
[3193.68 → 3196.68] We've all doubted.
[3196.68 → 3206.68] Have you ever felt God or God through others calling you to something great or something new or something different?
[3206.68 → 3210.68] Something that you just felt that you were totally incapable of doing?
[3210.68 → 3212.68] And we say, I'm not good enough.
[3212.68 → 3213.68] I'm not strong enough.
[3213.68 → 3214.68] I'm not pervasive enough.
[3214.68 → 3216.68] I'm not persuasive enough.
[3216.68 → 3217.68] Sorry.
[3217.68 → 3218.68] I'm not talented enough.
[3218.68 → 3219.68] I'm not old enough.
[3219.68 → 3220.68] Or I'm too old.
[3220.68 → 3221.68] Right?
[3221.68 → 3228.68] Whatever it is, we resonate with Moses' insecurities and his ideas of inadequacy.
[3228.68 → 3232.68] Moses was called to a project that was too big for him.
[3232.68 → 3233.68] Right?
[3233.68 → 3234.68] Too unsafe for him.
[3234.68 → 3235.68] Too uncomfortable.
[3235.68 → 3237.68] And he doubted himself.
[3237.68 → 3240.68] And in doubting himself, he doubted God.
[3240.68 → 3244.68] But God gave him a promise there in that bush.
[3244.68 → 3250.68] God promised that he would do miraculous works to convince the people and to convince Pharaoh.
[3250.68 → 3254.68] God promised that Moses' brother Aaron would go with him and speak on his behalf.
[3254.68 → 3260.68] God promised, most importantly and most profoundly, that God himself would go.
[3260.68 → 3264.68] I am will go with you.
[3264.68 → 3265.68] Right?
[3265.68 → 3271.68] The answer to Moses' persistent pattern of I can't was not God saying, yes, you can, Moses.
[3271.68 → 3274.68] The answer was, I can.
[3274.68 → 3275.68] God can.
[3275.68 → 3276.68] I will.
[3276.68 → 3277.68] I am.
[3277.68 → 3278.68] Says God.
[3278.68 → 3284.68] And so whether you're on the mountain top or in the dark valley of life below, whether
[3284.68 → 3290.68] you are halfway up or if you're sliding back down, hear God's voice this morning saying
[3290.68 → 3295.68] to you, I can, I will, I am.
[3295.68 → 3305.68] And when God called Moses to an impossible task, he said, I am with you.
[3305.68 → 3311.68] And when Jesus commissioned his disciples to another impossible task, to go into every
[3311.68 → 3312.68] nation.
[3312.68 → 3316.68] And remember this, this is places that are hostile, places that are unknown, places that
[3316.68 → 3320.68] are violent, places that want to kill them and overwhelm them.
[3320.68 → 3325.68] Jesus says, go live lives that will never be safe or comfortable or secure.
[3325.68 → 3332.68] Go into every nation and baptize them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the
[3332.68 → 3336.68] Holy Spirit and teach them to obey everything I have commanded you.
[3336.68 → 3345.68] He also said then, and surely I am with you always to the very end of the age.
[3345.68 → 3347.68] You see, there is no trial.
[3347.68 → 3348.68] There is no tribulation.
[3348.68 → 3349.68] There is no struggle.
[3349.68 → 3356.68] There is no unsafe place or no uncomfortable task that Jesus isn't in the midst of with
[3356.68 → 3357.68] us.
[3357.68 → 3361.68] He can, he will, he is.
[3361.68 → 3368.68] And it's that truth that Moses, that takes Moses from hiding in the wilderness and full
[3368.68 → 3372.68] of excuses to standing on the mountain top with God.
[3372.68 → 3378.68] It is that truth that takes Moses from I can't to God did, God can and God will.
[3378.68 → 3379.68] God will again.
[3379.68 → 3385.68] And it's this truth now that we want you to experience in worship today.
[3385.68 → 3390.68] Really, in every time and day of our worship.
[3390.68 → 3397.68] Whether you are restless, whether you are looking for rest or whether you are resting, rest in
[3397.68 → 3398.68] Jesus.
[3398.68 → 3402.68] He can, he will, and he is.
[3402.68 → 3403.68] He is.
[3403.68 → 3404.68] He is.
[3404.68 → 3409.68] Moses journeyed from timid and afraid to the mountain top because God was with him.
[3409.68 → 3417.68] And in the story that we read, Moses comes down, literally radiating after the encounter
[3417.68 → 3418.68] with God.
[3418.68 → 3421.68] Now, if your Bibles are open, let's set this stage here.
[3421.68 → 3425.68] Turn to chapter 33, just one page back.
[3425.68 → 3431.68] Chapter 33 in verse 16, halfway through verse 16.
[3431.68 → 3437.68] Moses asks God what else will distinguish me and your people from all the other people
[3437.68 → 3439.68] on the face of the earth?
[3439.68 → 3440.68] How will we be different?
[3440.68 → 3442.68] How will we be different?
[3442.68 → 3446.68] And the Lord said to Moses, I will do the very thing you have asked because I am pleased
[3446.68 → 3449.68] with you and I know you by name.
[3449.68 → 3454.68] Then Moses said, now show me your glory.
[3454.68 → 3458.68] Now show me your glory.
[3458.68 → 3461.68] What a phrase, right?
[3461.68 → 3462.68] What a prayer to ask.
[3462.68 → 3464.68] What a way to worship.
[3464.68 → 3470.68] Sometimes I wonder, imagine if on Sunday morning before you came to church, your prayer was simply,
[3470.68 → 3472.68] show me your glory.
[3472.68 → 3481.68] Imagine as you sat here listening to me preach, your prayer was, show me your glory.
[3481.68 → 3483.68] Show me your glory.
[3483.68 → 3487.68] And the amazing thing, right, if you continue reading that story, is that God showed up.
[3487.68 → 3489.68] God showed his glory.
[3489.68 → 3494.68] Now, God gave him just a glimpse of that and a glimpse to Moses like no other person, maybe
[3494.68 → 3497.68] other than Jesus in the Bible can claim, right?
[3497.68 → 3503.68] In verse 19, the Lord said, I will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you and I will
[3503.68 → 3507.68] proclaim my name, the Lord, in your presence.
[3507.68 → 3510.68] Notice this, okay, carefully.
[3510.68 → 3518.68] Moses asks to see the glory of God and then God says, I will show you my goodness.
[3518.68 → 3521.68] I will show you my character, my name, right?
[3521.68 → 3527.68] The Lord, I am, who was and is and is to come.
[3527.68 → 3531.68] Now, God isn't doing what Moses asks.
[3531.68 → 3532.68] Right?
[3532.68 → 3535.68] God answers, or Moses requests to show him his glory in a very particular way.
[3535.68 → 3541.68] In fact, I want to suggest that God is giving us a definition of his glory.
[3541.68 → 3544.68] And so what is the glory of God?
[3544.68 → 3546.68] It is his goodness revealed.
[3546.68 → 3547.68] Right?
[3547.68 → 3548.68] It is his character.
[3548.68 → 3551.68] It is his being revealed.
[3551.68 → 3553.68] And there's more, right?
[3553.68 → 3554.68] He goes on.
[3554.68 → 3559.68] I will cause my goodness to pass in front of you and I will proclaim my name, the Lord,
[3559.68 → 3560.68] in your presence.
[3560.68 → 3567.68] I will have mercy on whom I have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.
[3567.68 → 3568.68] Right?
[3568.68 → 3576.68] God is merciful and compassionate and seeing that and knowing that about him is experiencing
[3576.68 → 3578.68] some of his glory.
[3578.68 → 3582.68] But there's even more in this little phrase, on whom I have mercy.
[3582.68 → 3583.68] Right?
[3583.68 → 3584.68] On whom I have compassion.
[3584.68 → 3585.68] And this is it.
[3585.68 → 3586.68] Right?
[3586.68 → 3587.68] God decides.
[3587.68 → 3590.68] God gets to decide.
[3590.68 → 3591.68] God is independent.
[3591.68 → 3595.68] He alone is transcendent and sovereign.
[3595.68 → 3597.68] His will is ultimate.
[3597.68 → 3599.68] And he will not be coerced or manipulated.
[3599.68 → 3601.68] He does not show favouritism.
[3601.68 → 3604.68] And everything he does is perfect.
[3604.68 → 3610.68] And in our sort of spiritual but not religious culture.
[3610.68 → 3611.68] Right?
[3611.68 → 3613.68] In the rise of modern paganism.
[3613.68 → 3615.68] This truth about God.
[3615.68 → 3616.68] Right?
[3616.68 → 3618.68] This idea that God is independent.
[3618.68 → 3620.68] That he alone is necessary.
[3620.68 → 3622.68] That he alone is transcendent and sovereign.
[3622.68 → 3628.68] This idea about God is rejected and ignored or forgotten because it doesn't fit.
[3628.68 → 3632.68] It doesn't fit in a world view that puts me at the centre.
[3632.68 → 3639.68] It doesn't fit with the gospel messages we saw at the beginning that are proclaimed to us day in and day out.
[3639.68 → 3642.68] The truth is God wasn't created for humanity.
[3642.68 → 3645.68] Humanity was created for God's glory.
[3645.68 → 3652.68] That is offensive to a world that doesn't know God.
[3652.68 → 3656.68] And sometimes we forget the order.
[3656.68 → 3660.68] And we don't live out of the humility that comes from it.
[3660.68 → 3666.68] I like the way that one writer describes all of this.
[3666.68 → 3667.68] He says,
[3667.68 → 3671.68] Glory is the manifestation of God's reality.
[3671.68 → 3676.68] As heat is to fire, glory is to God.
[3676.68 → 3680.68] As wet is to water, glory is to God.
[3680.68 → 3684.68] As light is to bulb, glory is to God.
[3684.68 → 3688.68] Glory is what emanates from God.
[3688.68 → 3692.68] And that is what made Moses shine.
[3692.68 → 3697.68] Moses asked to see God's glory and God showed him only a part.
[3697.68 → 3698.68] God said,
[3698.68 → 3700.68] Moses, you can't see me.
[3700.68 → 3703.68] Nobody sees me and lives.
[3703.68 → 3709.68] If you look at the sun for five seconds with your eyes wide open, your eyes will burn out.
[3709.68 → 3710.68] God says to Moses,
[3710.68 → 3715.68] Do you know that I made more than 50 billion suns with a word from my mouth?
[3715.68 → 3719.68] You don't know exactly what you're asking me, Moses.
[3719.68 → 3720.68] Right?
[3720.68 → 3722.68] Man shall not see me and live.
[3722.68 → 3724.68] I am a consuming fire.
[3724.68 → 3726.68] I dwell in unapproachable light.
[3726.68 → 3735.68] But God did allow Moses to see a fraction of that light, a fraction of that consuming fire, a portion of that glory.
[3735.68 → 3742.68] And even that small, tiny little portion was enough to change him, to affect him.
[3742.68 → 3751.68] He shone, he radiated that veiled portion of glory to the point that he himself had to wear a veil for those around him.
[3751.68 → 3755.68] Lest those who looked at him would have their eyes burned out like looking at the sun.
[3755.68 → 3758.68] That's how the glory of God works.
[3758.68 → 3776.68] And our lives together are about discovering this truth of God, and pursuing that truth, and finding infinite satisfaction that can only be found in living in a community that is both revealing in glory and radiating that glory to others.
[3776.68 → 3779.68] That's what we are here to do.
[3779.68 → 3780.68] Right?
[3780.68 → 3791.68] To discover the God who made us and to live for his glory and to radiate off to the world how awesome he really is so that others too can see his glory.
[3791.68 → 3801.68] And so, let me tell you the open secret that is the gospel.
[3801.68 → 3805.68] And again, the true gospel, not those silly little messages that we hear all week long.
[3805.68 → 3806.68] Right?
[3806.68 → 3810.68] The open secret of the gospel is that we have seen his glory.
[3810.68 → 3814.68] The glory of the one and only.
[3814.68 → 3817.68] Come from the Father, full of grace and truth.
[3817.68 → 3819.68] And of course, I'm talking about Jesus.
[3819.68 → 3822.68] Jesus, who himself is the am.
[3822.68 → 3829.68] Jesus, who lived the life we should have lived and died the death that we all deserve because of his great love for us.
[3829.68 → 3836.68] Jesus, who is the glory of God revealed and did all that he did and died as he died for the glory of God.
[3836.68 → 3840.68] And now, that's the life we are called to.
[3840.68 → 3842.68] His life.
[3842.68 → 3847.68] A life lived for the glory of God.
[3847.68 → 3850.68] That's what it means to follow God's leading.
[3850.68 → 3851.68] Right?
[3851.68 → 3854.68] It means to radiate the glory of God to the world.
[3854.68 → 3858.68] It means to shine in the darkness as we are filled with his wonderful light.
[3858.68 → 3863.68] And when you live for the glory of God and not for those other lesser glories.
[3863.68 → 3866.68] Can you imagine?
[3866.68 → 3870.68] Imagine what your life would be like.
[3870.68 → 3873.68] Imagine what our church's life would be like.
[3875.68 → 3882.68] I've mentioned this idea, this next idea to our council and to our elders before.
[3882.68 → 3885.68] And I love the way that Don Cousins puts it.
[3885.68 → 3894.68] Don says, God wants to do the inconceivable, the uncommon, the unexpected, the remarkable, and the incomprehensible.
[3894.68 → 3901.68] So that he, God, is the only explanation for what occurs in our lives.
[3901.68 → 3916.68] And so right now, what inconceivable, what uncommon, what unexpected, remarkable, incomprehensible thing is God calling you to so that he can reveal his glory.
[3916.68 → 3922.68] As a church, right, this is the question of how we will follow God.
[3922.68 → 3928.68] Will we settle for a vision that is within our own hands and that's within our own power to accomplish?
[3928.68 → 3939.68] Or, or are you willing to follow God into the unknown so that he, and he alone, can do something impossible with us?
[3939.68 → 3942.68] I put it this way before to you.
[3942.68 → 3960.68] My responsibility, and our responsibility as leaders in this church and as those who are called to disciple others, is to grow you in faith and to lead you in faith so that you might walk up to the edge of your comfort zone and then take one more step.
[3960.68 → 3964.68] Because here's the bold truth.
[3964.68 → 3968.68] God is not in your comfort zone.
[3968.68 → 3970.68] Because you don't need him there.
[3970.68 → 3971.68] Right?
[3971.68 → 3976.68] It's only when you go beyond what you are able to do we get to see God show up.
[3976.68 → 3983.68] And so, earlier we prayed, and we've been announcing for weeks that we're looking for elders and deacons.
[3983.68 → 3986.68] And some of you are thinking, I can't do that.
[3986.68 → 3987.68] I don't have the skill set for that.
[3987.68 → 3989.68] And you're right, you don't.
[3989.68 → 3991.68] And you can't, but you know who can?
[3991.68 → 3993.68] God through you.
[3993.68 → 3996.68] And so maybe you need to hear this today.
[3996.68 → 3997.68] Right?
[3997.68 → 3998.68] Some of you are sitting here thinking,
[3998.68 → 3999.68] Whew.
[3999.68 → 4004.68] God's laid on my heart a burden for global missions.
[4004.68 → 4008.68] But I don't know if I can go around the world and leave all that I know and love here.
[4008.68 → 4011.68] And you're right, you can't.
[4011.68 → 4013.68] But God can.
[4013.68 → 4016.68] And he can do that with you and through you.
[4016.68 → 4017.68] Right?
[4017.68 → 4022.68] Some of you are thinking, oh, how can I use my side hustle for the kingdom of God?
[4022.68 → 4023.68] Right?
[4023.68 → 4029.68] Some of you are wondering, how is God calling me to stretch in my giving to the mission of the church?
[4029.68 → 4033.68] Now, let me be really clear as you're hearing this from me.
[4033.68 → 4036.68] Some of you are too scared to ask that question.
[4036.68 → 4038.68] And to be honest, I get that.
[4038.68 → 4040.68] And I want to say that that's okay.
[4040.68 → 4046.68] But I pray that you don't stay scared.
[4046.68 → 4054.68] And I realize to that some of us here this morning don't have imaginations, right, big enough to comprehend the scope of this question.
[4054.68 → 4057.68] And I want to say to you too, that's okay.
[4057.68 → 4063.68] But I pray that you have the trust and the faith to follow those of us who do.
[4063.68 → 4068.68] And that you would come along as we go on this journey together.
[4068.68 → 4073.68] Verse 29 of chapter 34 of our text says,
[4073.68 → 4081.68] His face was radiant because he had spoken with the Lord.
[4081.68 → 4086.68] People who experience the glory of God are changed.
[4086.68 → 4089.68] And we go out reflecting that glory.
[4089.68 → 4091.68] We image that glory.
[4091.68 → 4095.68] And we point the way to the source of that glory.
[4095.68 → 4110.68] A few years ago, I had the opportunity with a group of pastors and spouses to climb the traditional site of Mount Sinai.
[4110.68 → 4116.68] Now, the traditional site of Mount Sinai is on the southern part of the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt.
[4116.68 → 4118.68] There are some pictures on screen.
[4118.68 → 4121.68] We climbed up in the dark.
[4121.68 → 4128.68] We slept together under the stars in sleeping bags with maybe a thin mat on the floor.
[4128.68 → 4139.68] And then the next morning we watched the sunrise, and we did our morning devotions as the sun, the early morning sun burned off the few clouds that had appeared overnight.
[4139.68 → 4150.68] Now, Rachel, my wife, because of her back and because she's a sane person and doesn't want to sleep on a mountain at night, didn't join us on that part of the trip.
[4150.68 → 4162.68] And so I told her that my hope was to come down the mountain the next day with my face radiating like Moses so that she wouldn't even be able to look at me and I have to put a veil over top.
[4162.68 → 4169.68] Now, we came down the mountain the next day and maybe to Rachel's chagrin, I didn't have to put a veil on my face.
[4169.68 → 4176.68] And yet, and yet, and yet, and this part is awesome.
[4176.68 → 4179.68] I want you to hear this so follow along with me.
[4179.68 → 4186.68] And yet, 2 Corinthians 3.
[4186.68 → 4187.68] 3.
[4187.68 → 4194.68] Now, if the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in letters on stone.
[4194.68 → 4205.68] So, we're talking about the ministry of the law, right, that Moses brought down, he engraved on tablets of stone, and it brought death because we read elsewhere that the law served to increase our transgressions.
[4205.68 → 4207.68] That is to show us why we are guilty before God.
[4207.68 → 4218.68] If the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with glory so that the Israelites could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory.
[4218.68 → 4225.68] And so, it's moved on, but it still was with its glory that had an effect.
[4225.68 → 4237.68] Will not the ministry of the Spirit, listen, we are living in a post-Pentecost age, the Spirit has come, right, and each of us who believe are now filled with the Spirit.
[4237.68 → 4242.68] Will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious?
[4242.68 → 4244.24] Will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious?
[4244.24 → 4258.00] Will not the ministry of the Holy Spirit be even more glorious?
[4258.00 → 4265.06] If the ministry that brought condemnation was glorious, how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness?
[4265.06 → 4268.08] For what was glorious has no glory now in comparison with the surpassing glory.
[4268.08 → 4271.06] And if what was transitory came with glory, how much greater is the glory of that which lasts?
[4271.06 → 4273.12] We have such a hope.
[4274.94 → 4278.00] We are very bold.
[4279.56 → 4284.12] Are you bold in your glorying in Christ Jesus?
[4284.82 → 4286.56] We are not like Moses,
[4287.40 → 4289.58] who would have to put a veil over his face
[4289.58 → 4292.58] to prevent the Israelites from seeing the end of what was passing away,
[4292.58 → 4294.24] but their minds were made dull,
[4294.58 → 4297.56] for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read.
[4297.56 → 4301.62] It has not been removed because only in Christ it is taken away.
[4302.12 → 4305.56] Even to this day when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts.
[4305.98 → 4308.90] But whenever anyone turns to the Lord,
[4309.26 → 4310.22] turn to the Lord,
[4311.06 → 4313.02] the veil is taken away.
[4313.36 → 4314.96] And now the Lord is spirit,
[4315.12 → 4316.68] and where the spirit of the Lord is,
[4317.04 → 4318.46] there is freedom.
[4319.58 → 4323.70] And we all who now with unveiled faces
[4323.70 → 4325.72] contemplate the Lord's glory
[4325.72 → 4328.28] are being transformed into his image
[4328.28 → 4330.60] with ever-increasing glory,
[4330.60 → 4333.16] which comes from the Lord,
[4333.52 → 4335.72] who is spirit.
[4341.08 → 4342.16] I already,
[4342.90 → 4345.40] without needing to climb Mount Sinai,
[4345.74 → 4347.80] am I reflecting the glory of God.
[4348.66 → 4350.56] And insofar as I'm reflecting Jesus
[4350.56 → 4351.48] and the mission of God,
[4351.56 → 4353.08] insofar as I'm living my life
[4353.08 → 4354.78] in his holiness and in his design,
[4354.88 → 4357.36] insofar as I am loving like Jesus loves,
[4357.42 → 4359.40] and loving whom Jesus loves,
[4359.56 → 4363.18] I am reflecting the glory of God.
[4366.18 → 4368.70] Saint Grenades said,
[4370.14 → 4371.36] the glory of God
[4371.36 → 4374.98] is the human being fully alive.
[4374.98 → 4379.96] Do you want a full and abundant
[4379.96 → 4381.64] and alive life?
[4382.78 → 4384.38] Because this is where it is found.
[4385.46 → 4389.04] As my identity is all and only in Christ,
[4389.22 → 4389.76] my Lord,
[4389.86 → 4390.68] I am,
[4390.94 → 4391.76] as he said,
[4391.88 → 4394.96] being transformed into his likeness
[4394.96 → 4397.68] with ever-increasing glory.
[4397.86 → 4398.52] And that,
[4398.86 → 4399.84] my brothers and sisters,
[4400.08 → 4400.22] that,
[4400.30 → 4402.46] my fellow travellers on this journey
[4402.46 → 4403.44] of life and faith,
[4403.44 → 4405.50] that pilgrims in this pagan world,
[4405.68 → 4407.30] that is a gospel message
[4407.30 → 4409.24] that will never fade
[4409.24 → 4412.52] because our God will never fail.
[4412.62 → 4412.80] Amen?
[4415.80 → 4416.40] That
[4416.40 → 4418.74] is how your life
[4418.74 → 4420.08] truly becomes
[4420.08 → 4421.54] eternally
[4421.54 → 4422.92] radiant.
[4424.02 → 4424.34] Amen?
[4425.92 → 4426.86] Let's pray together.
[4426.86 → 4433.54] Amen and amen.
[4434.88 → 4435.64] Lord Jesus,
[4436.02 → 4438.00] transform us
[4438.00 → 4439.36] that we might reflect
[4439.36 → 4441.16] your glory.
[4441.40 → 4443.04] Transform us
[4443.04 → 4444.44] ever increasingly
[4444.44 → 4446.00] that we might radiate
[4446.00 → 4447.36] your presence
[4447.36 → 4448.66] and power
[4448.66 → 4449.70] to the world.
[4451.04 → 4451.38] And so,
[4451.48 → 4451.80] Lord God,
[4451.88 → 4453.22] give us the boldness
[4453.22 → 4454.68] that comes with being filled
[4454.68 → 4455.72] by your spirit
[4455.72 → 4457.18] and give us the humility
[4457.18 → 4458.28] that comes
[4458.28 → 4459.30] that knowing you
[4459.30 → 4461.12] and you alone
[4461.12 → 4464.08] are sovereign
[4464.08 → 4465.94] and independent.
[4466.96 → 4468.32] And it is on you
[4468.32 → 4469.64] that we depend.
[4470.92 → 4471.28] And so,
[4471.40 → 4471.66] Lord God,
[4471.72 → 4472.48] take us now
[4472.48 → 4473.12] to the edge
[4473.12 → 4474.08] of our comfort zones
[4474.08 → 4474.90] and allow us
[4474.90 → 4476.46] to go beyond.
[4477.52 → 4478.58] Allow us to go out
[4478.58 → 4480.14] to see that you
[4480.14 → 4481.54] are there.
[4481.54 → 4482.32] burden us
[4482.32 → 4483.32] with an impossible
[4483.32 → 4484.10] mission
[4484.10 → 4485.48] because all things
[4485.48 → 4486.36] are possible
[4486.36 → 4487.84] with God.
[4488.76 → 4489.24] Amen.
[4489.24 → 4489.36] Amen.
[4489.36 → 4489.40] Amen.
[4489.40 → 4489.42] Amen.
[4489.42 → 4489.44] Amen.
[4489.44 → 4491.40] Amen.
[4491.40 → 4493.44] Amen.
[4493.44 → 4495.44] Amen.
[4495.44 → 4497.44] Amen.
[4497.44 → 4499.44] Amen.
[4499.44 → 4501.44] Amen.
[4501.44 → 4503.44] Amen.
[4503.44 → 4505.44] Amen.
[4505.44 → 4507.44] Amen.
[4507.44 → 4507.50] Amen.
[4507.50 → 4509.50] Amen.
[4509.50 → 4509.54] Amen.
[4509.54 → 4510.54] Amen.
[4510.54 → 4511.52] Amen.
[4511.52 → 4512.52] Amen.
[4512.52 → 4520.64] Amen.
[4524.64 → 4525.68] Amen.
[4525.68 → 4528.56] You're beautiful
[4528.56 → 4537.80] Your face is all I see
[4537.80 → 4546.74] And when your eyes are on this child
[4546.74 → 4553.16] Your grace abounds to me
[4553.16 → 4561.16] The Lord please light the fire
[4561.72 → 4569.42] That once been bright and clear
[4569.42 → 4577.38] Replace the lamp of my first love
[4577.38 → 4583.38] That burns with holy fear
[4583.94 → 4588.38] I want to take your word
[4589.16 → 4592.38] And shine it all around
[4592.38 → 4594.38] Your selfie child
[4595.10 → 4599.38] To live with God
[4599.38 → 4604.60] And when I'm doing well
[4604.60 → 4606.38] I'll meet you
[4606.38 → 4607.38] I'll meet you
[4607.38 → 4614.38] My reward is giving glory to you
[4614.38 → 4621.70] Oh Lord, you're beautiful
[4621.70 → 4630.38] Your face is all I see
[4630.38 → 4641.38] And when your eyes are on this child
[4641.38 → 4649.38] Your grace abounds to me
[4649.38 → 4665.76] So I don't know where all of you are going this week
[4665.76 → 4669.38] But I do know that God is going with you
[4669.38 → 4673.30] And so go with his blessing
[4673.30 → 4677.38] Go with his promise to be with you
[4677.38 → 4679.92] Receive the blessing of our God
[4679.92 → 4684.54] May God go before you to guide you
[4684.54 → 4687.38] God go behind you to guard you
[4687.38 → 4689.48] God go beneath you to support you
[4689.48 → 4693.08] And God go beside you to befriend you
[4693.08 → 4695.28] Do not be afraid
[4695.28 → 4697.38] Let the blessing of God come upon you today
[4697.38 → 4699.16] Do not be afraid
[4699.16 → 4701.20] Go in peace
[4701.20 → 4702.08] And boldness
[4702.62 → 4703.58] And humility
[4703.58 → 4706.36] To step outside your comfort zones
[4706.36 → 4708.68] To serve the Lord
[4708.68 → 4710.32] Amen
[4710.32 → 4733.08] Why should I fear man?
[4733.08 → 4735.86] When you made the heavens
[4735.86 → 4739.98] Why should I be afraid
[4739.98 → 4743.92] When your doorless dies and plays
[4743.92 → 4747.84] Why should I lose heart
[4747.84 → 4751.10] When I know how great you are
[4751.10 → 4754.98] Why should I give up
[4754.98 → 4759.10] When your plans are full of love
[4759.10 → 4763.94] In this world we will have
[4763.94 → 4765.06] Trouble
[4765.06 → 4770.06] That you have overcome
[4770.06 → 4771.56] The world
[4771.56 → 4777.44] You shine
[4777.44 → 4781.14] Brighter than the brightest star
[4781.14 → 4784.76] Your love
[4784.76 → 4788.52] Brighter than the purest heart
[4788.52 → 4791.14] You shine
[4791.14 → 4795.52] Filling us with courage
[4795.52 → 4796.64] And strength
[4796.64 → 4800.64] To follow you
[4800.64 → 4809.76] Why should I fear man?
[4809.76 → 4812.60] When you made the heavens
[4812.60 → 4816.76] Why should I be afraid?
[4816.76 → 4820.88] When you put the stars to play?
[4820.88 → 4824.50] Why should I lose heart
[4824.50 → 4827.88] When I know how great you are?
[4827.88 → 4831.74] Why should I give up
[4831.74 → 4836.22] When your plans are full of love?
[4836.22 → 4842.34] In this world we will have trouble
[4842.34 → 4846.46] Because you have overcome
[4846.46 → 4848.46] The world
[4848.46 → 4853.40] You shine
[4853.40 → 4857.84] Brighter than the brightest star
[4857.84 → 4860.46] Your love
[4860.46 → 4864.58] Purer than the purest heart
[4864.58 → 4866.58] You shine
[4866.58 → 4867.58] You shine
[4867.58 → 4871.70] Filling us with courage
[4871.70 → 4872.70] And strength
[4872.70 → 4873.82] To follow you
[4873.82 → 4874.82] You shine

[4878.82 → 4879.82] You shine
[4879.82 → 4881.82] Brighter than the brightest star
[4881.82 → 4883.82] Your love
[4883.82 → 4884.82] You shine
[4884.82 → 4885.82] Brighter than the brightest star
[4885.82 → 4886.82] Your love
[4886.82 → 4889.82] Purer than the purest heart
[4889.82 → 4890.82] You shine
[4890.82 → 4891.82] You shine
