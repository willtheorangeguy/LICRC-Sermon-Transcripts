[0.00 → 5.44] I will worship you always
[5.44 → 9.60] And I will worship you
[9.60 → 13.22] I will worship you
[13.22 → 19.00] I will worship you always
[19.00 → 25.44] Father, we're on my knees
[25.44 → 29.14] With every heartbeat we
[29.14 → 31.98] We give this offering
[31.98 → 36.44] Lord, come and fill this place
[36.44 → 39.80] Father, we're crying out
[39.80 → 43.56] Spirit, we need you now
[43.56 → 47.38] Glorious love surrounds
[47.38 → 52.94] And I will worship you
[52.94 → 55.94] I will worship you
[55.94 → 59.78] I will worship you
[59.78 → 60.90] Always
[60.90 → 63.50] No matter what
[63.50 → 66.78] And I will worship you
[66.78 → 70.28] I will worship you
[70.28 → 73.78] I will worship you
[73.78 → 75.28] Always
[75.28 → 84.74] And I will worship you
[84.74 → 85.16] I will worship you
[85.16 → 88.72] I will worship you
[88.72 → 89.94] Always
[89.94 → 95.54] And I will worship you
[95.54 → 98.38] I will worship you
[98.38 → 100.38] I will worship you
[100.38 → 102.96] I will worship you
[102.96 → 104.38] Always
[104.38 → 125.52] I will worship you
[125.54 → 128.32] I will worship you
[128.32 → 142.88] I will worship you
[142.88 → 143.34] I will worship you
[143.34 → 147.88] I've been strong, and I've been broken with the end of the world.
[149.62 → 155.68] I've been faithful, and I've been reckless in every bend.
[157.52 → 162.54] I've got everything together and watched the shatter.
[164.68 → 169.96] I've still told, and I have crumbled in the same way.
[169.96 → 176.94] I have wrestled, and I have tripled to your surrender.
[179.16 → 183.96] Chased my heart, drifted and drifted all over again.
[186.40 → 191.50] Plundered blessing till I've been desperate to find redemption.
[192.88 → 199.14] Every time I'd sit around, you'll steal your name.
[199.96 → 209.36] I was found before I was close.
[210.36 → 216.94] I was yours before I was not.
[216.94 → 224.64] Grace keeps spared for all my mistakes.
[225.34 → 231.34] And that part just breaks me.
[231.34 → 240.74] I was found before I was close.
[240.74 → 241.74] I was found before I was close.
[241.74 → 243.74] I was found before I was close.
[243.74 → 251.98] First the word if I was close.
[254.14 → 256.14] I was AI proof.
[256.14 → 258.14] If I Esteban before I was close.
[258.14 → 263.64] How you love me and crucified
[263.64 → 282.78] Who am I to think your glory means my praises
[282.78 → 287.92] But if this borrowed breath is yours, Lord
[287.92 → 290.24] Take it all
[290.24 → 294.92] You are faithful, and you are gracious
[294.92 → 297.12] And I'm just grateful
[297.12 → 302.08] To think you don't need a single thing
[302.08 → 304.56] You still want my heart
[304.56 → 311.32] I was found
[311.32 → 315.32] Before I was lost
[315.32 → 318.64] I was lost
[318.64 → 322.32] Before I was lost
[322.32 → 326.30] You wear the scars
[326.30 → 329.98] For all my mistakes
[329.98 → 336.98] And my heart just wears me
[336.98 → 349.24] Well I love my heart
[349.24 → 350.02] Don't deserve this curse
[350.02 → 353.26] It's coming to
[353.26 → 357.24] It's the mines which we hope
[357.24 → 366.24] I never mind being somebody who's still warm so long.
[366.24 → 372.24] You love me as you find me.
[372.24 → 378.24] You love me as you find me.
[378.24 → 386.24] You love me as you find me.
[386.24 → 393.24] You love me as you find me.
[393.24 → 398.24] You love me as you find me.
[398.24 → 402.24] Your love's too good to leave me.
[402.24 → 405.24] You love me as you find.
[405.24 → 410.24] Your love's too good to leave me.
[410.24 → 412.24] You love me as you find me.
[412.24 → 416.24] You love me as you find me.
[416.24 → 418.24] You love me as you find me.
[418.24 → 420.24] You love me as you find me.
[420.24 → 422.24] You love me as you find me.
[422.24 → 428.24] You love me as you find me.
[428.24 → 430.24] You love me as you find me.
[430.24 → 432.24] You love me as you find me.
[432.24 → 438.24] You love me as you find me.
[438.24 → 440.24] You love me as you find me.
[440.24 → 442.24] You love me as you find me.
[442.24 → 444.24] You love me as you find me.
[444.24 → 448.24] You love me as you find me.
[448.24 → 454.24] You love me as you find me.
[454.24 → 458.24] Yes, this is the that's too good to leave me.
[458.24 → 463.74] In my heart, I won't second guess
[463.74 → 470.32] Because I need your love more than anything
[470.32 → 474.76] Because I may, I'm yours
[474.76 → 478.64] Your love's too good to be made
[478.64 → 485.80] Your love's too good to be made
[485.80 → 492.86] You are my heart, I won't second guess
[492.86 → 499.40] Because I need your love more than anything
[499.40 → 503.84] I may, I'm yours
[503.84 → 507.78] Your love's too good to be made
[507.78 → 514.80] Your love's too good to be made
[515.80 → 522.86] I know I, I don't deserve this kind of love
[522.86 → 529.86] Somehow, this kind of love is who you are
[529.86 → 533.86] It's a grace I could never find
[533.86 → 536.92] To be somebody whose still more
[536.92 → 543.92] So, I love you as you find
[543.92 → 550.98] I know I, I don't deserve this kind of love
[550.98 → 558.04] I know I, I don't deserve this kind of love
[558.04 → 560.04] I know I, I don't deserve this kind of love
[560.04 → 567.10] I, I don't deserve this kind of love
[567.10 → 569.10] I, I don't deserve this kind of love
[569.10 → 576.16] I, I don't deserve this kind of love
[576.16 → 580.16] I, I don't deserve this kind of love
[580.16 → 582.16] I, I don't deserve this kind of love
[582.16 → 597.22] I, I don't deserve this kind of love
[597.22 → 610.28] I, I don't deserve this kind of love
[610.28 → 612.28] Go on stage
[612.28 → 624.06] Sorry, we're live
[624.06 → 627.72] Welcome to church
[627.72 → 631.34] We're so excited to gather to worship together today
[631.34 → 635.04] If you are visiting with us or checking us out
[635.04 → 636.12] My name is Chris
[636.12 → 637.92] I'm one of the pastors here
[637.92 → 641.30] And it's my privilege, along with a few others yet
[641.30 → 643.96] To lead you in worship
[643.96 → 645.68] If you are checking us out
[645.68 → 647.86] We want to encourage you to grab one of these
[647.86 → 649.18] And fill it out
[649.18 → 652.10] There are paper versions available on the back
[652.10 → 655.34] There's also digital versions, QR codes you can scan
[655.34 → 658.92] And that just gives us a chance to connect with you
[658.92 → 662.18] And welcome you into our church family
[662.18 → 666.54] We are privileged in our worship this morning
[666.54 → 668.46] To celebrate Lord's Supper
[668.46 → 670.76] And so we will hear more about that later
[670.76 → 673.82] If you are joining us online and at home
[673.82 → 676.40] We encourage you to be prepared for that as well
[676.40 → 678.38] And also this morning
[678.38 → 683.00] We will be welcoming a new member
[683.00 → 687.22] Although, Yap, I don't see you anywhere currently
[687.22 → 690.68] So maybe we won't
[690.68 → 693.80] But we'll figure that out as we move through this together, right?
[694.48 → 694.98] Excellent
[694.98 → 699.70] There are just a couple other announcements to make this morning
[699.70 → 702.96] First, Children's Worship Time
[702.96 → 706.82] Which is the ministry that we run with kids
[706.82 → 709.12] During our worship
[709.12 → 712.06] Changes for the summer months
[712.06 → 715.24] And for the summer months
[715.24 → 719.70] As they provide that for preschool age kids
[719.70 → 722.26] Amy and Karis, the coordinators of that
[722.26 → 724.76] Are hoping to provide some relief
[724.76 → 728.26] For the regular Children's Worship Time teachers
[728.26 → 730.42] And so they are asking for people
[730.42 → 733.62] Who might be willing to lead and teach
[733.62 → 734.82] Children's Worship Time
[734.82 → 736.38] During the summer months
[736.38 → 738.80] Both as teachers and as helpers
[738.80 → 740.60] And so there is a sign-up sheet
[740.60 → 742.82] At the Children's Worship Time booth
[742.82 → 743.42] Back there
[743.42 → 744.84] Where you can sign in
[744.84 → 746.62] Or sign up for Sunday
[746.62 → 748.04] And check into that
[748.04 → 749.56] If you have questions
[749.56 → 751.82] Grab Amy or grab Karis
[751.82 → 753.22] And they will
[753.22 → 755.84] I see Karis anyway
[755.84 → 756.42] Wave your hand
[756.42 → 757.14] Real high, Karis
[757.14 → 757.72] There you go
[757.72 → 758.76] Talk to Karis
[758.76 → 760.38] And then Amy was somewhere
[760.38 → 761.82] Anyway, you can grab her
[761.82 → 763.64] And they can fill that in for you
[763.64 → 766.80] Also, this is the last week
[766.80 → 768.90] Before the All Leaders Lunch
[768.90 → 771.56] Which is our volunteer appreciation Saturday
[771.56 → 774.40] That's coming up next week Saturday
[774.40 → 776.08] On the 18th
[776.08 → 778.12] And we're going to have lunch together
[778.12 → 779.10] We're going to say thank you
[779.10 → 780.22] For the work that you do
[780.22 → 782.14] And we want to provide some training
[782.14 → 783.70] And so there are some breakout sessions
[783.70 → 785.48] That you can sign up for there
[785.48 → 787.50] One of the breakout sessions
[787.50 → 789.70] Will be led by Liz Lamp
[789.70 → 792.40] Who will talk about ministry to children
[792.40 → 794.44] Another by Dina Nikolai
[794.44 → 797.12] Who works with refugees
[797.12 → 799.82] And she'll talk about ministry to the margins
[799.82 → 801.10] I will lead one
[801.10 → 803.84] And then there'll be some small group discussions
[803.84 → 806.00] Around leading small groups
[806.00 → 808.18] And worshipping together
[808.18 → 808.86] And leading worship
[808.86 → 811.66] And, so please check out in the e-bulletin
[811.66 → 812.58] Or on our website
[812.58 → 813.84] Go to the events tab
[813.84 → 814.90] And you will see that there
[814.90 → 816.08] And you can sign up there
[816.08 → 817.60] If you have any questions about that
[817.60 → 819.78] You can grab me after service together
[819.78 → 823.06] I think those are the announcements
[823.06 → 824.94] I'm going to invite you
[824.94 → 825.82] As you're able
[825.82 → 826.50] And where you are
[826.50 → 827.14] To stand
[827.14 → 828.24] And we can be
[828.24 → 830.24] Ushered into the presence of God
[830.24 → 831.30] Receive his greeting
[831.30 → 832.98] And worship him
[832.98 → 833.76] In song
[833.76 → 834.40] Word
[834.40 → 835.18] And table
[835.18 → 836.10] Together
[836.10 → 837.82] Receive the greeting
[837.82 → 839.10] Of our God
[839.10 → 841.04] Grace
[841.04 → 842.76] Mercy
[842.76 → 844.44] And peace to you
[844.44 → 845.50] From God
[845.50 → 845.96] Our Father
[845.96 → 846.40] And the Lord
[846.40 → 847.04] Jesus Christ
[847.04 → 847.66] His Son
[847.66 → 848.86] And our Saviour
[848.86 → 850.26] Through the presence
[850.26 → 850.86] And power
[850.86 → 852.20] Of the Holy Spirit
[852.20 → 854.02] Amen
[854.02 → 855.58] Let's worship God this morning
[855.58 → 859.50] Good morning
[859.50 → 861.68] Our call to worship this morning
[861.68 → 863.38] Comes from Psalm 63
[863.38 → 864.92] Verse 1 to 4
[864.92 → 866.48] O God
[866.48 → 867.48] You are my God
[867.48 → 868.64] I earnestly
[868.64 → 870.28] Earnestly I seek you
[870.28 → 872.28] My soul thirsts for you
[872.28 → 873.92] My flesh faints for you
[873.92 → 876.10] As in a dry and weary land
[876.10 → 877.24] Where there is no water
[877.24 → 879.36] So I have looked upon you
[879.36 → 880.18] In the sanctuary
[880.18 → 881.56] Beholding your power
[881.56 → 882.28] And glory
[882.28 → 884.58] Because your steadfast love
[884.58 → 885.58] Is better than life
[885.58 → 887.48] My lips will praise you
[887.48 → 889.28] So I will bless you
[889.28 → 890.88] As long as I live
[890.88 → 891.98] In your name
[891.98 → 894.50] I will lift my hands
[894.50 → 896.42] Let's worship God together
[924.50 → 927.24] I cast my mind
[927.24 → 929.32] To Calvary
[929.32 → 932.66] Where Jesus went
[932.66 → 936.10] And died for me
[936.10 → 938.92] I see His wounds
[938.92 → 941.96] His hands, His feet
[941.96 → 948.50] My Saviour on the cursed tree
[948.50 → 953.50] His body bound
[953.50 → 957.56] And drenched in tears
[957.56 → 960.50] They laid Him down
[960.50 → 963.88] In Joseph's tomb
[963.88 → 966.50] The entrance sealed
[967.32 → 969.50] By heavy stones
[970.28 → 973.60] A sigh of sin
[973.60 → 975.60] And all alone
[975.60 → 976.60] And all alone
[976.60 → 983.54] Oh, praise the name
[983.54 → 986.78] Of the Lord our God
[986.78 → 989.96] Oh, praise His name
[989.96 → 992.60] Forevermore
[992.60 → 995.60] For endless days
[995.60 → 997.60] We will sing
[997.60 → 997.92] We will sing
[997.92 → 999.72] Your praise
[999.72 → 1001.42] O Lord
[1001.42 → 1002.60] O Lord
[1002.60 → 1002.94] O Lord
[1002.94 → 1005.60] Our God
[1005.60 → 1010.60] And on the third
[1010.60 → 1014.60] At break of dawn
[1014.60 → 1017.60] The Son of Heaven
[1017.60 → 1020.60] Rose again
[1020.60 → 1023.48] Oh, trampled death
[1023.48 → 1024.60] When text
[1024.60 → 1026.48] The angels roar
[1026.48 → 1030.54] The angels roar
[1030.54 → 1037.14] For Christ the King
[1037.42 → 1039.06] Oh, praise the name
[1039.06 → 1044.94] Oh, praise the name of the Lord our God.
[1044.94 → 1050.94] Oh, praise His name forevermore.
[1051.98 → 1058.04] For endless days we will sing Your praise.
[1058.42 → 1063.94] Oh, Lord, oh, Lord our God.
[1063.94 → 1073.44] He shall return in robes of white.
[1073.44 → 1080.02] The blazing sun shall pierce the night.
[1080.02 → 1086.02] And I will rise among the saints.
[1086.02 → 1093.02] My faith transcends on Jesus' name.
[1093.94 → 1123.92] Oh, praise the name of the Lord our God.
[1123.92 → 1128.60] The name of the Lord our God.
[1128.98 → 1134.42] Oh, praise His name forevermore.
[1134.42 → 1141.48] For endless days we will sing Your praise.
[1141.48 → 1146.48] Oh, Lord, oh, Lord our God.
[1146.48 → 1154.36] Oh, praise the name of the Lord our God.
[1154.36 → 1159.48] Oh, praise His name forevermore.
[1159.48 → 1167.36] For endless days we will sing Your praise.
[1167.36 → 1173.64] O Lord, O Lord our God
[1173.64 → 1181.04] O Lord, O Lord our God
[1197.36 → 1227.34] O Lord, O Lord our God
[1227.34 → 1257.32] O Lord, O Lord our God
[1257.34 → 1287.32] O Lord, O Lord our God
[1287.32 → 1291.56] I'm lost in desperation
[1291.56 → 1295.50] All things work together
[1295.50 → 1298.40] For my salvation
[1298.40 → 1306.40] I am not my own
[1306.40 → 1309.44] But belong
[1309.44 → 1313.50] Body and soul
[1313.50 → 1316.92] In my life
[1316.92 → 1320.32] And in death
[1320.32 → 1324.24] To you, Lord
[1324.24 → 1328.28] Christ my Lord
[1346.92 → 1361.08] Always by your Holy Spirit
[1361.08 → 1363.32] You assure me
[1363.32 → 1366.72] Of eternal life
[1366.72 → 1370.48] And make me willing and ready
[1370.48 → 1376.22] Even when I can't see my way through
[1376.22 → 1383.54] From now on to always live for you

[1489.90 → 1490.68] To Jesus
[1490.68 → 1492.80] We come to him
[1492.80 → 1495.50] In a time of personal silent prayer
[1495.50 → 1497.88] Confessing our needs
[1497.88 → 1499.32] And our struggles

[1925.66 → 1926.66] Toward the goal
[1926.66 → 1928.22] To win the prize

[1975.90 → 1982.80] Where pain is gone and mercy fills the streets
[1982.80 → 1988.64] To look upon the one who pled to save
[1988.64 → 1994.58] And walk with him for all eternity
[1994.58 → 2005.32] There will be a day when all will bow for him
[2005.32 → 2012.08] There will be a day when death will be no more
[2012.08 → 2019.92] Standing face to face with him who died and rose again
[2019.92 → 2025.56] Holy, holy is the Lord
[2025.56 → 2034.76] In every prayer we pray in desperation
[2034.76 → 2041.66] The songs of faith we send through doubt and fear
[2041.66 → 2048.70] In the end we'll see that it was worth it
[2048.70 → 2054.40] When he returns to my way until
[2054.40 → 2064.54] There will be a day when all will bow for him
[2064.54 → 2071.38] There will be a day when death will be no more
[2071.38 → 2079.14] Standing face to face with him who died and rose again
[2079.14 → 2085.62] Holy, holy is the Lord
[2085.62 → 2094.02] And on that day we'll join the resurrection
[2094.02 → 2101.20] And stand beside the heroes of the faith
[2101.20 → 2107.94] With one voice, a thousand generations
[2107.94 → 2109.94] With one voice, a thousand generations
[2109.94 → 2111.94] With one voice, a thousand generations
[2111.94 → 2113.94] With one voice, a thousand generations
[2113.94 → 2114.94] And worthy is the Lamb who was slain
[2114.94 → 2120.94] And on that day we'll join the resurrection
[2120.94 → 2127.94] And stand beside the heroes of the faith
[2127.94 → 2130.68] With one voice, a thousand generations
[2130.68 → 2140.68] Sing worthy is the Lamb who was slain
[2140.68 → 2146.68] Sing worthy is the Lamb who shall reign
[2146.68 → 2148.68] Sing worthy is the Lamb who shall reign
[2148.68 → 2153.42] Sing worthy is the Lamb who shall reign
[2153.42 → 2154.50] Sing worthy is the Lamb
[2154.50 → 2156.42] So there will be a day when all will be in the Lamb
[2156.42 → 2159.42] With angels and the saints
[2159.42 → 2163.42] We raise the mighty roar
[2163.42 → 2171.16] Glory to our God who gave us life beyond the grave
[2171.16 → 2176.42] Holy, holy is the Lord
[2176.42 → 2179.16] Holy, holy is the Lord
[2179.16 → 2180.16] So let it be today
[2180.16 → 2183.16] We shout the hymn of heaven
[2183.16 → 2186.16] With angels and the saints
[2186.16 → 2189.16] We raise the mighty roar
[2189.16 → 2192.16] Glory to our God
[2192.16 → 2197.96] Who gave us life beyond the grave
[2197.96 → 2204.28] Holy, holy is the Lord
[2204.28 → 2210.02] Holy, holy is the Lord
[2210.02 → 2217.02] Holy, holy is the Lord
[2217.02 → 2219.02] Holy, holy is the Lord
[2219.02 → 2223.76] Holy, holy is the Lord
[2223.76 → 2224.76] Holy, holy is the Lord
[2224.76 → 2226.76] Holy, holy is the Lord
[2226.76 → 2230.28] I'm going to take a moment
[2230.28 → 2237.64] And welcome a new member
[2237.64 → 2240.12] Into our church fellowship
[2240.12 → 2243.74] Yep, Walschlager has been worshipping with us
[2243.74 → 2248.90] For 10, 12, 10 years or so
[2248.90 → 2254.50] And yet has not taken the official step of membership
[2254.50 → 2255.64] And, so I want to be really clear
[2255.64 → 2258.08] Yap has been one of us for a long time
[2258.08 → 2260.48] He's been of us for a while
[2260.48 → 2262.78] He belongs to our church family
[2262.78 → 2265.92] But today we are making that official
[2265.92 → 2268.68] Now in about three minutes
[2268.68 → 2270.88] You'll hear why we're making that official today
[2270.88 → 2273.02] As Yap was nominated to be a deacon
[2273.02 → 2277.76] No, that's not why
[2277.76 → 2281.42] That's just what moved us to accelerate the process a little bit
[2281.42 → 2284.20] And so Yap, I want to invite you up to the front
[2284.20 → 2287.50] We're going to officially welcome you
[2287.50 → 2288.72] With just a couple questions
[2288.72 → 2290.14] In which you can respond
[2290.14 → 2293.20] Giving a chance to reaffirm your faith
[2293.20 → 2294.00] Come right up here
[2294.00 → 2294.82] Here, we'll even
[2294.82 → 2298.04] So the people at home can see
[2298.04 → 2299.18] Use the microphone
[2299.18 → 2303.10] And so as we welcome you officially
[2303.10 → 2305.90] As a member of this church family
[2305.90 → 2308.92] We ask that you would reaffirm your faith
[2308.92 → 2311.52] That you have confessed already
[2311.52 → 2313.66] And your commitment to God's mission
[2313.66 → 2315.76] In and through Langley Emmanuel
[2315.76 → 2317.82] To our city and the region
[2317.82 → 2318.90] And to the world beyond
[2318.90 → 2320.76] As we serve Jesus Christ
[2320.76 → 2321.60] And to do that
[2321.60 → 2323.62] I'm going to ask you three questions
[2323.62 → 2325.40] At the end, I'll ask for your answer
[2325.40 → 2326.98] Three questions
[2326.98 → 2329.64] Do you believe in the Lord Jesus
[2329.64 → 2331.50] As your Saviour and Lord
[2331.50 → 2333.02] And that in Him only
[2333.02 → 2336.22] Is hope and freedom from sin found
[2336.22 → 2338.56] And do you believe that the Bible
[2338.56 → 2339.78] Is the Word of God
[2339.78 → 2341.46] Revealing His plan for redemption
[2341.46 → 2342.62] In Jesus Christ
[2342.62 → 2344.44] And that the preaching and teaching
[2344.44 → 2345.48] Of Langley Emmanuel
[2345.48 → 2347.10] Reflect this truth
[2347.10 → 2349.04] And third
[2349.04 → 2351.20] Do you promise with the help of the Holy Spirit
[2351.20 → 2352.50] To do all that you can
[2352.50 → 2354.74] To strengthen your relationship to Jesus
[2354.74 → 2356.90] By being part of this church
[2356.90 → 2359.48] Recognizing its authority and oversight
[2359.48 → 2362.52] And joining with us on mission for Jesus
[2362.52 → 2363.68] In this community
[2363.68 → 2364.70] This city
[2364.70 → 2365.92] And to the world
[2365.92 → 2366.90] Yap
[2366.90 → 2368.44] What is your answer?
[2368.86 → 2369.04] Yes
[2369.04 → 2370.28] Right here
[2370.28 → 2371.06] So everyone can hear
[2371.06 → 2372.04] Yes I do
[2372.04 → 2373.34] Yes he does
[2373.34 → 2373.70] Amen
[2373.70 → 2375.20] Welcome officially
[2375.20 → 2377.84] To church family
[2377.84 → 2378.66] Bless God
[2378.66 → 2379.52] Thank you very much
[2379.52 → 2385.18] I do want to invite you
[2385.18 → 2387.48] If you've been visiting regularly with us
[2387.48 → 2389.02] Or checking us out online
[2389.02 → 2390.18] If you have questions
[2390.18 → 2391.50] About what it means to belong
[2391.50 → 2392.54] To the covenant family
[2392.54 → 2393.88] We want to answer those for you
[2393.88 → 2394.88] And so you can grab me
[2394.88 → 2395.56] After the service
[2395.56 → 2396.26] Or like I said
[2396.26 → 2397.32] Use that connect form
[2397.32 → 2398.88] And ask that question
[2398.88 → 2399.68] And we would love to
[2399.68 → 2400.96] Have that conversation
[2400.96 → 2402.06] I'm going to invite
[2402.06 → 2403.86] Whoever is doing
[2403.86 → 2405.06] The kids blessing next
[2405.06 → 2410.12] No one else is coming
[2410.12 → 2411.40] So there you go
[2411.40 → 2412.96] You have two jobs
[2412.96 → 2413.96] Or you want the kids first
[2413.96 → 2414.58] Or you're going to do
[2414.58 → 2415.18] Which one are you?
[2415.18 → 2415.76] Kids first
[2415.76 → 2416.68] Kids first
[2416.68 → 2417.10] Oh man

[2423.18 → 2424.42] And have a listen
[2424.42 → 2425.48] While I do the announcements
[2425.48 → 2425.98] If you want
[2425.98 → 2431.00] This is kind of sometimes
[2431.00 → 2431.58] What happens
[2431.58 → 2432.76] I was not supposed to be
[2432.76 → 2433.64] On schedule to do
[2433.64 → 2434.32] Children's worship
[2434.32 → 2435.22] But I looked around
[2435.22 → 2436.16] And none of my partners
[2436.16 → 2437.04] Are here this morning
[2437.04 → 2438.74] So I'm going to have to
[2438.74 → 2440.02] Figure something out
[2440.02 → 2443.22] Here we go
[2443.22 → 2447.84] We got a new piano player
[2447.84 → 2448.68] In the church
[2448.68 → 2449.92] Alright
[2449.92 → 2451.08] I got a couple announcements
[2451.08 → 2451.74] For you all

[2546.24 → 2546.98] Like a minute ago
[2546.98 → 2547.86] What the story's about
[2547.86 → 2548.06] Today
[2548.06 → 2548.74] It's about Jonah
[2548.74 → 2549.26] Do you guys know
[2549.26 → 2550.20] About the story about Jonah?
[2550.56 → 2551.10] Heard that one?

[2553.32 → 2554.34] Talk about that in the back
[2554.34 → 2555.00] But what I thought
[2555.00 → 2555.86] We would do this morning
[2555.86 → 2556.56] While we're sitting here
[2556.56 → 2557.34] Why don't we spend
[2557.34 → 2557.90] A couple of minutes

[2559.26 → 2560.42] That they are thankful
[2560.42 → 2561.34] For this morning
[2561.34 → 2562.18] That you could share
[2562.18 → 2562.72] With everybody

[2637.84 → 2638.70] The
[2638.70 → 2638.76] The
[2638.76 → 2643.46] The
[2667.84 → 2680.02] Good morning
[2680.02 → 2680.88] My name is Dave
[2680.88 → 2682.56] I am one of the elders
[2682.56 → 2683.22] In this church
[2683.22 → 2684.28] So we're all here
[2684.28 → 2684.82] To serve you
[2684.82 → 2686.46] It is my turn to lead us
[2686.46 → 2688.06] In our church family prayer
[2688.06 → 2689.92] Let us pray
[2689.92 → 2693.20] Father
[2693.20 → 2694.36] It is very good for us
[2694.36 → 2694.84] To be here
[2694.84 → 2695.44] On
[2695.44 → 2696.88] Sunday
[2696.88 → 2697.96] On the Lord's Day
[2697.96 → 2699.48] For us to celebrate
[2699.48 → 2699.98] Your name
[2699.98 → 2701.46] We gather with the church
[2701.46 → 2701.94] Universal
[2701.94 → 2702.94] With the church everywhere
[2702.94 → 2704.44] With Christians around the world
[2704.44 → 2705.94] On this day
[2705.94 → 2707.32] To celebrate
[2707.32 → 2708.60] The fact that we are all
[2708.60 → 2709.02] Christians
[2709.02 → 2711.08] And share that one name
[2711.08 → 2712.64] Father
[2712.64 → 2713.98] We
[2713.98 → 2715.46] Always spend time
[2715.46 → 2716.78] In our church service
[2716.78 → 2717.10] To
[2717.10 → 2719.40] Spend time for confession
[2719.40 → 2721.52] We think about the things
[2721.52 → 2722.40] That we have done
[2722.40 → 2723.62] We think about the
[2723.62 → 2724.00] The
[2724.00 → 2725.52] Things that we have said
[2725.52 → 2726.46] That have not been
[2726.46 → 2727.22] Honouring to you
[2727.22 → 2728.76] Or serving to those around us
[2728.76 → 2730.30] We think about those things
[2730.30 → 2731.28] That we have not done
[2731.28 → 2732.20] And those things
[2732.20 → 2733.16] That we have not said
[2733.16 → 2734.18] And we should have
[2734.18 → 2736.36] Ways to build each other up
[2736.36 → 2738.36] And to serve the people around us
[2738.36 → 2739.48] Father
[2739.48 → 2739.78] We
[2739.78 → 2741.56] Confess those failings
[2741.56 → 2743.66] But we take great assurance
[2743.66 → 2745.62] That we do not have to bear that burden
[2745.62 → 2748.12] That we don't need to feel guilt
[2748.12 → 2749.46] We don't need to feel shame
[2749.46 → 2751.50] Because Jesus has taken our guilt
[2751.50 → 2752.22] And our shame
[2752.22 → 2753.02] On the cross
[2753.02 → 2754.04] And he bore it for us
[2754.04 → 2755.52] Father
[2755.52 → 2756.46] There are many things
[2756.46 → 2757.38] That we have to be
[2757.38 → 2758.24] Thankful for
[2758.24 → 2760.12] We think about this church community
[2760.12 → 2762.30] That meets so regularly
[2762.30 → 2763.20] And that loves you
[2763.20 → 2764.32] And cares about each other
[2764.32 → 2765.72] We think about the leadership
[2765.72 → 2766.48] In this church
[2766.48 → 2767.86] We thank you for Pastor Chris
[2767.86 → 2768.68] For Pastor Kevin
[2768.68 → 2770.10] For Pastor Josh
[2770.10 → 2770.96] And the important
[2770.96 → 2773.48] Leadership roles
[2773.48 → 2774.32] That they could have
[2774.32 → 2775.88] Father we thank you
[2775.88 → 2777.06] For the school year
[2777.06 → 2779.14] That is finishing up soon
[2779.14 → 2780.36] We thank you
[2780.36 → 2781.58] For an opportunity
[2781.58 → 2782.40] To learn more
[2782.40 → 2785.12] About ourselves
[2785.12 → 2787.12] Our place in the world
[2787.12 → 2788.46] Our place in society
[2788.46 → 2791.40] Our place as a Canadian citizen
[2791.40 → 2794.44] Our understanding of the creation
[2794.44 → 2795.98] And our relationship with you
[2795.98 → 2797.78] We think especially
[2797.78 → 2798.70] Of those who are
[2798.70 → 2800.46] Who are graduating this week
[2800.46 → 2802.44] And it's important
[2802.44 → 2803.08] To celebrate
[2803.08 → 2805.82] Their 13 years of education
[2805.82 → 2808.68] We pray that
[2808.68 → 2810.32] Those who have to make
[2810.32 → 2810.94] Some decisions
[2810.94 → 2811.88] After graduation
[2811.88 → 2813.08] That will have some wisdom
[2813.08 → 2813.98] And some insight
[2813.98 → 2815.80] So whether they be
[2815.80 → 2817.70] Going right into the workforce
[2817.70 → 2819.20] Or spending time travelling
[2819.20 → 2820.02] Time travelling
[2820.02 → 2821.60] Going on a missions trip
[2821.60 → 2823.76] Going to trade school
[2823.76 → 2824.96] Or going to a university
[2824.96 → 2826.52] We pray that
[2826.52 → 2828.26] Whatever task that they give
[2828.26 → 2829.26] Would be a chance for them
[2829.26 → 2830.56] To learn more about themselves
[2830.56 → 2832.50] Serve people around them
[2832.50 → 2833.52] And build a relationship
[2833.52 → 2834.20] With you
[2834.20 → 2836.62] We do take comfort
[2836.62 → 2838.32] In some words
[2838.32 → 2838.84] That you shared
[2838.84 → 2840.00] Through the prophet Jeremiah
[2840.00 → 2841.70] That when we are uncertain
[2841.70 → 2842.42] About the future
[2842.42 → 2843.80] That we know
[2843.80 → 2845.04] That you have plans for us
[2845.04 → 2846.36] Plans to give us hope
[2846.36 → 2847.30] And a future
[2847.30 → 2849.00] Father
[2849.00 → 2851.56] There are also many things
[2851.56 → 2852.60] That we bring before you
[2852.60 → 2856.16] We thank you for the life
[2856.16 → 2857.24] Of Louise Rehabs
[2857.24 → 2859.08] And as a church congregation
[2859.08 → 2860.30] We mourn her passing
[2860.30 → 2862.92] Her illness came suddenly
[2862.92 → 2864.24] And in some ways
[2864.24 → 2865.72] It seemed like a very short time
[2865.72 → 2866.36] And in others
[2866.36 → 2868.30] It seemed like a very long time
[2868.30 → 2870.30] Of waiting for what would happen
[2870.30 → 2873.18] We pray for her family
[2873.18 → 2874.54] And we pray for Peter
[2874.54 → 2875.56] For her children
[2875.56 → 2876.36] Her grandchildren
[2876.36 → 2878.18] For other family
[2878.18 → 2879.20] And her many friends
[2879.20 → 2880.94] We pray that
[2880.94 → 2882.32] You will be with them all
[2882.32 → 2883.30] As they go through
[2883.30 → 2884.26] This period of grief
[2884.26 → 2884.96] And of mourning
[2884.96 → 2886.56] That they will feel your strength
[2886.56 → 2888.02] That they will feel your comfort
[2888.02 → 2889.62] In the same way
[2889.62 → 2890.36] We think about
[2890.36 → 2891.72] Leslie Cool
[2891.72 → 2892.24] And her family
[2892.24 → 2893.54] With the passing of her father
[2893.54 → 2894.20] Bill Potma
[2894.20 → 2896.48] And with the knowledge
[2896.48 → 2897.82] That he has been laid to rest
[2897.82 → 2900.64] We thank you
[2900.64 → 2901.62] That there is opportunity
[2901.62 → 2902.68] To celebrate life
[2902.68 → 2904.84] And to begin the next stage
[2904.84 → 2905.28] Of grieving
[2905.28 → 2906.44] And living life
[2906.44 → 2908.08] Father we thank you
[2908.08 → 2908.88] That in this church
[2908.88 → 2909.78] We get to celebrate
[2909.78 → 2911.26] The profession of faith
[2911.26 → 2912.88] Of Ruth Baker
[2912.88 → 2913.56] James Porter
[2913.56 → 2914.74] And Kaylee Spoor
[2914.74 → 2915.74] We thank you
[2915.74 → 2916.96] That those three
[2916.96 → 2919.50] Have feel the relationship
[2919.50 → 2920.00] With you
[2920.00 → 2921.14] They know the love
[2921.14 → 2921.82] That you have
[2921.82 → 2922.40] And are willing
[2922.40 → 2923.56] To make a commitment
[2923.56 → 2925.76] Of service to you
[2925.76 → 2926.62] And full membership
[2926.62 → 2927.46] In this church
[2927.46 → 2929.32] We think about
[2929.32 → 2930.38] AAP Wollschlager
[2930.38 → 2931.50] A new member
[2931.50 → 2932.70] And not a new member
[2932.70 → 2933.32] Of this church
[2933.32 → 2934.64] We thank you
[2934.64 → 2936.02] For the important part
[2936.02 → 2937.02] That he plays
[2937.02 → 2938.28] In his family
[2938.28 → 2939.40] And in this church community
[2939.40 → 2941.08] And we do welcome
[2941.08 → 2943.46] Him as that new member
[2943.46 → 2945.54] Father we have
[2945.54 → 2946.62] More general prayers too
[2946.62 → 2947.28] We think about
[2947.28 → 2948.22] Those who are experiencing
[2948.22 → 2948.72] Pain
[2948.72 → 2949.44] Loss
[2949.44 → 2950.68] Or difficulty
[2950.68 → 2952.58] Whatever that may be
[2952.58 → 2954.30] Sometimes we know about it
[2954.30 → 2955.68] Sometimes we do not
[2955.68 → 2957.10] We pray for your comfort
[2957.10 → 2958.42] And the fellowship
[2958.42 → 2959.36] Of your people
[2959.36 → 2961.18] Father we think about
[2961.18 → 2962.08] The synod of the
[2962.08 → 2962.96] Christian Reformed Church
[2962.96 → 2963.58] That will be
[2963.58 → 2964.82] Meeting soon
[2964.82 → 2966.14] There are important
[2966.14 → 2967.00] Decisions that need
[2967.00 → 2967.46] To be made
[2967.46 → 2968.06] On behalf of
[2968.06 → 2969.14] The entire denomination
[2969.14 → 2970.80] We pray for wisdom
[2970.80 → 2972.06] For our representatives
[2972.06 → 2972.90] And for our leaders
[2972.90 → 2974.20] And that they'll make
[2974.20 → 2975.70] Decisions that
[2975.70 → 2977.32] Accurately reflect
[2977.32 → 2978.50] Your will for our lives
[2978.50 → 2979.98] And will bring our church
[2979.98 → 2980.78] Closer together
[2980.78 → 2982.38] Father we continue
[2982.38 → 2983.22] To pray for the world
[2983.22 → 2983.84] Around us
[2983.84 → 2984.58] For the ongoing
[2984.58 → 2985.70] Conflict in Ukraine
[2985.70 → 2988.54] We pray for all of those
[2988.54 → 2989.74] Many who have been
[2989.74 → 2990.66] Displaced by war
[2990.66 → 2992.88] The significant damage
[2992.88 → 2993.38] That is done
[2993.38 → 2994.24] All over the country
[2994.24 → 2996.52] And just the fear
[2996.52 → 2997.06] And uncertainty
[2997.06 → 2997.78] That it brings
[2997.78 → 2999.28] We pray for the Russians
[2999.28 → 2999.60] Too
[2999.60 → 3003.36] That they may
[3003.36 → 3004.36] Understand
[3004.36 → 3005.82] The difficulty
[3005.82 → 3006.48] That this war
[3006.48 → 3007.00] Is causing
[3007.00 → 3008.76] And that there may be
[3008.76 → 3009.40] An opportunity
[3009.40 → 3010.60] For a peaceful future
[3010.60 → 3012.12] Father
[3012.12 → 3013.42] We thank you
[3013.42 → 3014.10] For this church
[3014.10 → 3015.88] And we think about
[3015.88 → 3016.34] The service
[3016.34 → 3017.16] That is up ahead
[3017.16 → 3018.40] A time for worship
[3018.40 → 3019.78] A time to remember
[3019.78 → 3020.66] Jesus' sacrifice
[3020.66 → 3021.56] As we commune
[3021.56 → 3022.36] With the Lord's Supper
[3022.36 → 3023.48] We pray for
[3023.48 → 3024.38] Pastor Chris
[3024.38 → 3025.00] Who is sharing
[3025.00 → 3026.02] His message with us
[3026.02 → 3027.40] About holy habits
[3027.40 → 3029.32] And we pray
[3029.32 → 3030.64] That what he says
[3030.64 → 3031.52] Will be a good reflection
[3031.52 → 3032.80] Of his will for our lives
[3032.80 → 3034.06] And that we will
[3034.06 → 3035.86] Build these holy habits
[3035.86 → 3036.76] Something that
[3036.76 → 3038.18] Becomes second nature
[3038.18 → 3038.68] To us
[3038.68 → 3040.10] And part of our
[3040.10 → 3042.06] Our daily routines
[3042.06 → 3043.18] Father
[3043.18 → 3044.76] We pray for all of us
[3044.76 → 3045.56] We thank you
[3045.56 → 3046.22] For this church
[3046.22 → 3047.44] And we know
[3047.44 → 3048.22] That you are here
[3048.22 → 3049.44] Because you have promised
[3049.44 → 3050.04] To be present
[3050.04 → 3051.20] Whenever two or three
[3051.20 → 3052.48] Are gathered in your name
[3052.48 → 3054.44] Father we pray
[3054.44 → 3055.32] All these things
[3055.32 → 3057.14] Not because we deserve it
[3057.14 → 3058.26] But we ask it
[3058.26 → 3059.04] In Jesus' name
[3059.04 → 3059.88] Amen
[3078.22 → 3087.68] We're going to
[3087.68 → 3090.88] Continue in our worship
[3090.88 → 3092.84] By reading together
[3092.84 → 3094.34] From John 6
[3094.34 → 3095.78] Now
[3095.78 → 3098.02] The order of service
[3098.02 → 3098.88] And the screen
[3098.88 → 3099.68] May only have
[3099.68 → 3101.10] John 6 verse 68
[3101.10 → 3102.08] But I'm going to start
[3102.08 → 3102.56] Reading
[3102.56 → 3103.94] At verse 60
[3103.94 → 3105.88] So if you have
[3105.88 → 3106.34] A Bible
[3106.34 → 3107.44] Handy
[3107.44 → 3107.98] And in front of you
[3107.98 → 3108.36] I encourage you
[3108.36 → 3109.04] To open that up
[3109.04 → 3109.78] We'll start
[3109.78 → 3110.50] At verse 60
[3110.50 → 3131.76] All right
[3131.76 → 3132.46] John 6
[3132.46 → 3133.68] Starting
[3133.68 → 3133.70] Starting
[3133.70 → 3134.92] At verse 60
[3134.92 → 3138.30] On hearing it
[3138.30 → 3139.36] That is the teaching
[3139.36 → 3140.28] That Jesus had been giving
[3140.28 → 3142.46] Many of the disciples said
[3142.46 → 3145.06] This is a hard teaching
[3145.06 → 3146.26] Who can accept it?
[3147.62 → 3148.10] Aware
[3148.10 → 3149.08] That his disciples
[3149.08 → 3150.16] Were grumbling
[3150.16 → 3150.94] About this
[3150.94 → 3152.04] Jesus said to them
[3152.04 → 3153.98] Does this offend you?
[3154.98 → 3155.94] What if you see
[3155.94 → 3156.76] The son of man
[3156.76 → 3157.30] Ascend
[3157.30 → 3158.76] To where he was before?
[3159.74 → 3161.36] The spirit gives life
[3161.36 → 3162.14] The flesh
[3162.14 → 3163.36] Counts for nothing
[3163.36 → 3164.26] The words
[3164.26 → 3165.32] I have spoken to you
[3165.32 → 3166.06] Are spirit
[3166.06 → 3168.18] And they are life
[3168.18 → 3170.72] Yet there are some of you
[3170.72 → 3171.82] Who do not believe
[3171.82 → 3173.54] For Jesus
[3173.54 → 3174.34] Had known
[3174.34 → 3175.26] From the beginning
[3175.26 → 3176.00] Which of them
[3176.00 → 3176.90] Did not believe
[3176.90 → 3178.46] And who would betray them
[3178.46 → 3179.26] Betray him
[3179.26 → 3181.52] He went on to say
[3181.52 → 3183.64] This is why I told you
[3183.64 → 3185.14] That no one can come to me
[3185.14 → 3186.20] Unless the father
[3186.20 → 3187.08] Enables them
[3187.08 → 3189.74] From this time
[3189.74 → 3190.74] Many of his disciples
[3190.74 → 3191.58] Turned back
[3191.58 → 3192.50] And no longer
[3192.50 → 3193.30] Followed him
[3193.30 → 3195.88] You do not want
[3195.88 → 3196.54] To leave too
[3196.54 → 3197.08] Do you?
[3197.46 → 3198.58] Jesus asked the twelve
[3198.58 → 3200.96] And Simon Peter
[3200.96 → 3201.54] Answered him
[3201.54 → 3202.88] And this is our focus
[3202.88 → 3204.08] Lord
[3204.08 → 3205.00] To whom
[3205.00 → 3205.96] Shall we go?
[3206.96 → 3207.26] You
[3207.26 → 3208.02] Have
[3208.02 → 3208.86] The words
[3208.86 → 3209.60] Of eternal
[3209.60 → 3210.56] Life
[3210.56 → 3212.38] And we believe
[3212.38 → 3213.24] And know
[3213.24 → 3214.02] That you
[3214.02 → 3216.10] Are the holy one
[3216.10 → 3217.38] Of God
[3217.38 → 3218.88] This is the word
[3218.88 → 3219.28] Of the Lord
[3219.28 → 3225.16] All right
[3225.16 → 3225.58] I'm going to
[3225.58 → 3227.44] Take a risk
[3227.44 → 3228.12] This morning
[3228.12 → 3229.92] A risk
[3229.92 → 3230.44] At embarrassing
[3230.44 → 3230.96] Myself
[3230.96 → 3231.82] Greatly
[3231.82 → 3232.88] But how many
[3232.88 → 3233.48] Of you
[3233.48 → 3234.26] Remember
[3234.26 → 3235.10] This song
[3235.10 → 3235.60] And as soon
[3235.60 → 3236.16] As you remember
[3236.16 → 3236.34] It
[3236.34 → 3236.80] Join me
[3236.80 → 3237.28] Because you
[3237.28 → 3237.54] Don't want
[3237.54 → 3237.90] Me singing
[3237.90 → 3238.24] Alone
[3238.24 → 3239.72] Rachel's
[3239.72 → 3240.12] Nodding
[3240.12 → 3241.46] Very quickly
[3241.46 → 3242.32] Saying please
[3242.32 → 3243.14] Okay
[3243.14 → 3245.66] Read your
[3245.66 → 3246.62] Bibles
[3246.62 → 3247.26] Pray
[3247.26 → 3248.70] Every day
[3248.70 → 3249.74] Pray
[3249.74 → 3250.54] Every
[3250.54 → 3251.30] Day
[3251.30 → 3252.18] Pray
[3252.18 → 3253.02] Every
[3253.02 → 3253.72] Day
[3253.72 → 3254.58] Okay we can stop
[3254.58 → 3255.22] We don't have to go
[3255.22 → 3257.98] For those of you who are online
[3257.98 → 3258.60] And listening
[3258.60 → 3259.94] All you heard was me there
[3259.94 → 3260.58] Apologies
[3260.58 → 3262.04] It sounded much better in here
[3262.04 → 3264.86] Read your Bible
[3264.86 → 3266.50] And pray every day
[3266.50 → 3268.32] If you are
[3268.32 → 3269.64] Of my generation
[3269.64 → 3270.34] Or older
[3270.34 → 3272.82] That was on the salty tapes
[3272.82 → 3273.54] If you're older
[3273.54 → 3274.76] The salty records
[3274.76 → 3275.50] Right
[3275.50 → 3276.58] That grandma or grandma
[3276.58 → 3277.54] Used to put on
[3277.54 → 3278.64] When you went to visit them
[3278.64 → 3279.38] And they got tired
[3279.38 → 3280.10] Of watching you
[3280.10 → 3280.54] So they said
[3280.54 → 3281.46] Let's put some music on
[3281.46 → 3282.10] So that they could go
[3282.10 → 3282.94] At least that's what
[3282.94 → 3283.68] Happened in my house
[3283.68 → 3284.20] I don't know
[3284.20 → 3286.62] Read your Bible
[3286.62 → 3287.90] Pray every day
[3287.90 → 3288.86] And you'll
[3288.86 → 3289.86] Grow
[3289.86 → 3290.76] Grow
[3290.76 → 3291.68] Grow
[3291.68 → 3293.36] But why
[3293.36 → 3297.78] Why will you grow
[3297.78 → 3299.94] Will you
[3299.94 → 3300.66] Grow
[3300.66 → 3303.18] And if it's so true
[3303.18 → 3304.96] When was the last time
[3304.96 → 3305.66] You read your Bible
[3305.66 → 3306.50] Every
[3306.50 → 3307.50] Every
[3307.50 → 3307.68] Day
[3307.68 → 3309.64] Well let me put it this way
[3309.64 → 3312.34] How many times
[3312.34 → 3313.94] Has a pastor
[3313.94 → 3314.72] Whether it's me
[3314.72 → 3315.54] Or someone else
[3315.54 → 3316.32] Or an elder
[3316.32 → 3317.42] Or a Christian mentor
[3317.42 → 3318.82] In your life
[3318.82 → 3320.26] Asked you the question
[3320.26 → 3322.28] How is your Bible
[3322.28 → 3323.44] Devotion going
[3323.44 → 3325.76] And then what's your answer
[3325.76 → 3326.92] Right
[3326.92 → 3327.68] Without fail
[3327.68 → 3328.90] Every single time
[3328.90 → 3330.04] I ask this question
[3330.04 → 3331.52] I get the same answer
[3331.52 → 3334.14] It could be better
[3334.14 → 3337.62] I could
[3337.62 → 3338.00] I could
[3338.00 → 3339.18] Probably do more
[3339.18 → 3341.74] Of course it could be better
[3341.74 → 3342.90] Right
[3342.90 → 3343.42] We could all
[3343.42 → 3343.96] Do better
[3343.96 → 3344.50] I'm
[3344.50 → 3346.12] I'm a pastor
[3346.12 → 3347.30] You
[3347.30 → 3348.80] Pay me
[3348.80 → 3350.14] To study the Bible
[3350.14 → 3351.12] And to discern
[3351.12 → 3351.78] Its teachings
[3351.78 → 3352.64] And distill it out
[3352.64 → 3353.78] And present them to you
[3353.78 → 3355.94] That's my job
[3355.94 → 3357.24] And I could do better
[3357.24 → 3359.06] So of course
[3359.06 → 3359.46] We could
[3359.46 → 3360.52] Do better
[3360.52 → 3362.60] You could spend
[3362.60 → 3363.18] A month
[3363.18 → 3364.30] In devotional
[3364.30 → 3365.78] Spiritual retreat
[3365.78 → 3367.20] Reading only the Bible
[3367.20 → 3368.54] For every waking
[3368.54 → 3369.14] Minute
[3369.14 → 3369.86] And you could still
[3369.86 → 3370.66] Answer the question
[3370.66 → 3372.10] How is your Bible
[3372.10 → 3372.64] Reading going
[3372.64 → 3373.10] Saying
[3373.10 → 3374.24] Ah it could be better
[3374.24 → 3376.46] Now really
[3376.46 → 3378.26] What I think
[3378.26 → 3380.26] When I hear that
[3380.26 → 3380.52] And I
[3380.52 → 3381.96] I'm willing for you
[3381.96 → 3382.94] To challenge me on this
[3382.94 → 3383.86] And we can fight
[3383.86 → 3384.80] In the parking lot after
[3384.80 → 3386.70] When I think
[3386.70 → 3387.58] When people give
[3387.58 → 3388.88] That kind of answer
[3388.88 → 3390.20] It's a sort of
[3390.20 → 3391.24] Non-answer
[3391.24 → 3393.40] To deflect
[3393.40 → 3394.50] Or to minimize
[3394.50 → 3396.02] What we know
[3396.02 → 3396.64] The importance
[3396.64 → 3397.66] Of the question
[3397.66 → 3398.10] To be
[3398.10 → 3399.38] Right
[3399.38 → 3400.44] I know it's important
[3400.44 → 3401.56] I should probably
[3401.56 → 3402.60] Do more
[3402.60 → 3404.56] But what we're hiding
[3404.56 → 3407.44] For most of us
[3407.44 → 3408.92] Is that we don't
[3408.92 → 3409.66] Really do much
[3409.66 → 3411.68] Or any
[3411.68 → 3414.06] At least
[3414.06 → 3414.68] Not anything
[3414.68 → 3415.26] Personally
[3415.26 → 3416.50] Significant
[3416.50 → 3417.10] Now they've done
[3417.10 → 3418.34] All sorts of
[3418.34 → 3420.02] Studies on this
[3420.02 → 3421.46] And there are
[3421.46 → 3422.24] Statistics that
[3422.24 → 3423.58] That bear that out
[3423.58 → 3425.28] But for most of you
[3425.28 → 3426.56] Sitting here
[3426.56 → 3428.06] On Sunday morning
[3428.06 → 3428.52] Right
[3428.52 → 3429.42] And most of you
[3429.42 → 3430.36] Are the kind of people
[3430.36 → 3430.98] Right
[3430.98 → 3431.86] Who are committed enough
[3431.86 → 3432.54] To your relationship
[3432.54 → 3432.84] To God
[3432.84 → 3433.56] That you come to church
[3433.56 → 3434.08] On Sunday
[3434.08 → 3435.42] Perhaps more than
[3435.42 → 3436.94] Once or twice a month
[3436.94 → 3438.60] But for most of us
[3438.60 → 3439.60] Even sitting here
[3439.60 → 3441.96] The only time of the week
[3441.96 → 3443.12] That you open up your Bible
[3443.12 → 3444.40] Or scroll through your Bible
[3444.40 → 3445.14] If that's how you
[3445.14 → 3445.90] Read it
[3445.90 → 3446.88] Is on Sunday
[3446.88 → 3448.86] When I say
[3448.86 → 3449.78] Turn to
[3449.78 → 3451.40] Whatever
[3451.40 → 3452.98] Page or place
[3452.98 → 3454.42] We happen to be reading
[3454.42 → 3460.06] That's one of the reasons
[3460.06 → 3460.54] Why
[3460.54 → 3462.76] I say that
[3462.76 → 3463.46] Right
[3463.46 → 3464.28] To turn to
[3464.28 → 3464.74] One of the reasons
[3464.74 → 3465.50] Why I think it's important
[3465.50 → 3467.14] For us to have a Bible
[3467.14 → 3467.78] In hand
[3467.78 → 3469.08] Or to look at
[3469.08 → 3470.36] As we go through
[3470.36 → 3470.98] So that we are
[3470.98 → 3472.26] Learning the habit
[3472.26 → 3474.20] Of opening up a Bible
[3474.20 → 3475.80] Right
[3475.80 → 3476.26] One of the reasons
[3476.26 → 3476.88] Why I recommend
[3476.88 → 3477.42] That you bring
[3477.42 → 3478.28] Your own Bible
[3478.28 → 3478.96] Is so that you can
[3478.96 → 3479.60] Highlight it
[3479.60 → 3481.44] And understand it
[3481.44 → 3482.82] And dig into it
[3482.82 → 3484.66] And make connections
[3484.66 → 3486.60] And draw all over it
[3486.60 → 3486.78] Right
[3486.78 → 3488.28] The best Bible
[3488.28 → 3489.16] Is the one
[3489.16 → 3490.10] That's falling apart
[3490.10 → 3490.78] From use
[3490.78 → 3493.04] Now to illustrate that
[3493.04 → 3494.86] I've actually pulled out
[3494.86 → 3496.32] My old Bible
[3496.32 → 3498.58] This is the one
[3498.58 → 3499.40] I've used
[3499.40 → 3500.34] For the last 10 years
[3500.34 → 3501.28] When I came here
[3501.28 → 3502.16] I bought a new one
[3502.16 → 3503.40] And started creating
[3503.40 → 3503.94] A new one
[3503.94 → 3505.22] But this one
[3505.22 → 3506.02] Is the one
[3506.02 → 3506.68] That I have used
[3506.68 → 3507.34] Devotionally
[3507.34 → 3508.00] And in preaching
[3508.00 → 3508.56] For years
[3508.56 → 3509.70] And it's full of
[3509.70 → 3510.90] Folded pages
[3510.90 → 3512.10] And taped back together
[3512.10 → 3513.22] Pages and creases
[3513.22 → 3514.50] And underlines
[3514.50 → 3515.00] And lines
[3515.00 → 3515.72] Honestly you look
[3515.72 → 3516.80] At this page in particular
[3516.80 → 3517.50] And like you
[3517.50 → 3518.84] You can't make sense
[3518.84 → 3519.24] Of that
[3519.24 → 3520.70] Yet I can
[3520.70 → 3522.04] Right
[3522.04 → 3523.56] And we dig through it
[3523.56 → 3524.16] There are stickers
[3524.16 → 3525.24] And underlines
[3525.24 → 3525.96] And things
[3525.96 → 3528.18] But
[3528.18 → 3529.52] A Bible that looks
[3529.52 → 3530.20] Like this
[3530.20 → 3530.60] Is it
[3530.60 → 3531.42] Hopefully
[3531.42 → 3532.54] A testimony
[3532.54 → 3533.98] Of its use
[3533.98 → 3535.28] In my life
[3535.28 → 3536.84] Now
[3536.84 → 3539.72] As we start here
[3539.72 → 3540.36] This morning
[3540.36 → 3541.16] And as we talk about
[3541.16 → 3541.86] Holy habits
[3541.86 → 3543.00] And creating those habits
[3543.00 → 3544.32] I want to be really clear
[3544.32 → 3545.30] I'm not
[3545.30 → 3546.68] Introducing this
[3546.68 → 3547.68] Or having this conversation
[3547.68 → 3548.22] With you
[3548.22 → 3548.94] Because I want to
[3548.94 → 3549.76] Guilt you
[3549.76 → 3550.82] Into something
[3550.82 → 3551.62] Right
[3551.62 → 3552.10] I'm not trying to
[3552.10 → 3552.84] Shame you
[3552.84 → 3553.52] Into reading
[3553.52 → 3554.08] Your Bible
[3554.08 → 3554.58] More
[3554.58 → 3555.14] Right
[3555.14 → 3555.68] That's never
[3555.68 → 3556.44] My intent
[3556.44 → 3556.86] And so
[3556.86 → 3558.32] If you are
[3558.32 → 3559.12] Hearing that
[3559.12 → 3559.70] From me
[3559.70 → 3560.18] Let me
[3560.18 → 3560.44] One
[3560.44 → 3561.30] Apologize
[3561.30 → 3561.84] For that
[3561.84 → 3562.38] Unspoken
[3562.38 → 3562.94] Communication
[3562.94 → 3563.38] But let me
[3563.38 → 3563.58] Two
[3563.58 → 3564.12] Push back
[3564.12 → 3564.38] And say
[3564.38 → 3564.60] If you're
[3564.60 → 3565.08] Getting offended
[3565.08 → 3565.56] By what I'm
[3565.56 → 3565.82] Saying
[3565.82 → 3566.56] It's striking
[3566.56 → 3567.06] A chord
[3567.06 → 3567.84] That's not
[3567.84 → 3568.10] Me
[3568.10 → 3568.60] That's your
[3568.60 → 3568.94] Heart
[3568.94 → 3570.42] Hear that
[3570.42 → 3572.52] But
[3572.52 → 3573.44] What I would
[3573.44 → 3574.26] Like to do
[3574.26 → 3575.00] With us
[3575.00 → 3575.48] This morning
[3575.48 → 3576.12] Is spend
[3576.12 → 3576.80] Some time
[3576.80 → 3577.34] Hopefully
[3577.34 → 3578.60] Casting
[3578.60 → 3579.64] A compelling
[3579.64 → 3580.44] Vision
[3580.44 → 3581.60] A compelling
[3581.60 → 3582.30] Picture
[3582.30 → 3583.20] For the
[3583.20 → 3583.70] Reason
[3583.70 → 3584.68] Why this
[3584.68 → 3585.22] Is such
[3585.22 → 3586.04] An integral
[3586.04 → 3587.04] Holy
[3587.04 → 3587.88] Habit
[3587.88 → 3588.64] For us
[3588.64 → 3589.42] To develop
[3589.42 → 3590.18] Together
[3590.18 → 3590.54] And so
[3590.54 → 3591.10] This morning
[3591.10 → 3592.60] We're going to
[3592.60 → 3593.64] Operate under
[3593.64 → 3594.36] The banner
[3594.36 → 3595.06] Of or the
[3595.06 → 3595.80] Theme of
[3595.80 → 3596.98] The big
[3596.98 → 3597.62] Idea
[3597.62 → 3598.64] Of this
[3598.64 → 3599.32] Line
[3599.32 → 3601.96] The disciple
[3601.96 → 3602.62] Of Jesus
[3602.62 → 3603.52] Listens
[3603.52 → 3603.90] To
[3603.90 → 3605.20] And
[3605.20 → 3605.84] Learns
[3605.84 → 3606.02] To
[3606.02 → 3606.50] Love
[3606.50 → 3607.84] The word
[3607.84 → 3608.52] Of god
[3608.52 → 3609.50] As the
[3609.50 → 3610.02] Voice
[3610.02 → 3610.98] Of Jesus
[3610.98 → 3611.96] For life
[3611.96 → 3612.94] And faith
[3612.94 → 3613.94] In him
[3613.94 → 3614.98] Now
[3614.98 → 3616.62] Last week
[3616.62 → 3616.82] When we
[3616.82 → 3617.28] Started this

[3618.88 → 3619.44] Books
[3619.44 → 3620.88] And
[3620.88 → 3621.98] In each
[3621.98 → 3622.46] Week
[3622.46 → 3622.80] There is
[3622.80 → 3623.30] A section
[3623.30 → 3624.90] Called
[3624.90 → 3625.38] Sermon
[3625.38 → 3625.74] Notes
[3625.74 → 3626.72] That line
[3626.72 → 3626.98] That i
[3626.98 → 3627.18] Just
[3627.18 → 3627.48] Gave

[3631.24 → 3631.36] To

[3631.60 → 3631.94] The word
[3631.94 → 3632.26] Of god
[3632.26 → 3632.48] As the
[3632.48 → 3632.68] Voice
[3632.68 → 3633.02] Of Jesus

[3635.96 → 3636.28] Your note
[3636.28 → 3636.66] Section
[3636.66 → 3637.28] And so
[3637.28 → 3637.96] These books
[3637.96 → 3638.56] Are intended

[3645.54 → 3645.92] Week
[3645.92 → 3646.62] Or you

[3658.98 → 3660.90] Also
[3660.90 → 3665.36] This morning
[3665.36 → 3666.12] As we
[3666.12 → 3667.24] Study
[3667.24 → 3668.82] The holy
[3668.82 → 3669.48] Habit
[3669.48 → 3670.40] Of listening
[3670.40 → 3671.52] To Jesus
[3671.52 → 3672.02] The holy
[3672.02 → 3672.38] Habit
[3672.38 → 3673.40] Of scripture
[3673.40 → 3673.82] Reading
[3673.82 → 3675.08] Remember
[3675.08 → 3676.24] From last
[3676.24 → 3676.72] Time
[3676.72 → 3677.38] That we
[3677.38 → 3678.32] Are training
[3678.32 → 3679.42] Our ears
[3679.42 → 3680.32] To
[3680.32 → 3681.34] As we
[3681.34 → 3681.94] Think about
[3681.94 → 3682.46] These holy
[3682.46 → 3682.90] Habits
[3682.90 → 3683.70] To listen
[3683.70 → 3684.72] For how
[3684.72 → 3685.96] These individual
[3685.96 → 3686.58] Holy
[3686.58 → 3688.10] Habits
[3688.10 → 3688.78] How these
[3688.78 → 3689.66] Things that
[3689.66 → 3690.48] You practice
[3690.48 → 3692.14] And take
[3692.14 → 3692.80] Into the
[3692.80 → 3693.16] Rhythms
[3693.16 → 3693.68] Of your
[3693.68 → 3694.10] Life
[3694.10 → 3695.38] Whether it's
[3695.38 → 3695.80] Scripture
[3695.80 → 3696.14] Reading
[3696.14 → 3696.82] Or prayer
[3696.82 → 3697.78] Or community
[3697.78 → 3698.56] Or giving
[3698.56 → 3699.78] Or worship
[3699.78 → 3701.18] Whichever one
[3701.18 → 3701.54] We go
[3701.54 → 3701.92] Through
[3701.92 → 3702.98] How each
[3702.98 → 3703.28] Of these
[3703.28 → 3703.96] Holy habits
[3703.96 → 3704.44] Have both
[3704.44 → 3705.24] An inward
[3705.24 → 3706.42] Internal
[3706.42 → 3707.46] Aspect
[3707.46 → 3708.44] And how
[3708.44 → 3708.82] They have
[3708.82 → 3709.62] An external
[3709.62 → 3710.64] Or outward
[3710.64 → 3711.86] Aspect to
[3711.86 → 3712.06] Them
[3712.06 → 3712.92] Right
[3712.92 → 3713.44] How does
[3713.44 → 3714.38] This discipline
[3714.38 → 3715.32] This habit
[3715.32 → 3716.20] Grow my
[3716.20 → 3716.96] Relationship to
[3716.96 → 3717.28] God
[3717.28 → 3717.86] In Jesus
[3717.86 → 3718.88] And how
[3718.88 → 3719.44] Does this
[3719.44 → 3719.94] Discipline
[3719.94 → 3720.40] This habit
[3720.40 → 3720.76] Give me
[3720.76 → 3721.50] Opportunity
[3721.50 → 3721.94] Or grow
[3721.94 → 3722.76] My opportunities
[3722.76 → 3723.80] To love
[3723.80 → 3724.60] And serve
[3724.60 → 3725.34] My neighbour
[3725.34 → 3727.14] So inward
[3727.14 → 3728.14] And outward
[3728.14 → 3729.16] As we
[3729.16 → 3730.36] Learn to
[3730.36 → 3730.86] Love
[3730.86 → 3731.48] The word
[3731.48 → 3731.90] Of god
[3731.90 → 3732.24] As the
[3732.24 → 3732.64] Voice of
[3732.64 → 3732.90] Jesus
[3732.90 → 3733.56] For life
[3733.56 → 3734.46] And faith
[3734.46 → 3735.22] In him
[3735.22 → 3735.80] This will
[3735.80 → 3736.42] Be true
[3736.42 → 3737.24] As we
[3737.24 → 3738.36] Look at
[3738.36 → 3739.02] God's
[3739.02 → 3739.74] Word
[3739.74 → 3741.38] Now in
[3741.38 → 3742.08] The word
[3742.08 → 3743.30] What we're
[3743.30 → 3743.64] Going to see
[3743.64 → 3744.02] In john
[3744.02 → 3744.50] Six
[3744.50 → 3745.52] In the
[3745.52 → 3745.80] Word
[3745.80 → 3746.42] Is how
[3746.42 → 3747.20] You take
[3747.20 → 3748.14] In
[3748.14 → 3749.48] Jesus
[3749.48 → 3751.18] Like I said
[3751.18 → 3751.44] We're going
[3751.44 → 3751.74] To make
[3751.74 → 3752.22] This point
[3752.22 → 3752.64] In john
[3752.64 → 3752.96] Six
[3752.96 → 3753.44] We started
[3753.44 → 3753.82] Reading
[3753.82 → 3754.80] At verse
[3754.80 → 3755.26] 60
[3755.26 → 3756.50] But we're
[3756.50 → 3756.94] Actually going
[3756.94 → 3757.16] To go
[3757.16 → 3757.68] Back
[3757.68 → 3758.84] To that
[3758.84 → 3759.30] Hard
[3759.30 → 3759.88] Teaching
[3759.88 → 3761.12] That Jesus
[3761.12 → 3761.58] Mentions
[3761.58 → 3761.90] At the
[3761.90 → 3762.22] Beginning
[3762.22 → 3763.50] To underscore
[3763.50 → 3764.84] What's going
[3764.84 → 3765.50] On Jesus
[3765.50 → 3765.96] Says
[3765.96 → 3766.52] On hearing
[3766.52 → 3766.88] It many
[3766.88 → 3767.10] Of the
[3767.10 → 3767.58] Disciples
[3767.58 → 3768.30] Said this
[3768.30 → 3768.80] Is a
[3768.80 → 3769.18] Hard
[3769.18 → 3769.80] Teaching
[3769.80 → 3770.60] Who
[3770.60 → 3770.88] Can
[3770.88 → 3771.26] Accept
[3771.26 → 3771.50] It
[3771.50 → 3772.90] So
[3772.90 → 3773.40] It
[3773.40 → 3775.16] Behooves
[3775.16 → 3775.52] Us
[3775.52 → 3776.92] To go
[3776.92 → 3777.40] Back to
[3777.40 → 3777.86] That hard
[3777.86 → 3778.22] Teaching
[3778.22 → 3778.98] What is
[3778.98 → 3779.16] It
[3779.16 → 3779.70] That Jesus
[3779.70 → 3781.58] Is talking
[3781.58 → 3781.94] About
[3781.94 → 3782.76] Now in
[3782.76 → 3782.90] Verse
[3782.90 → 3783.50] 26
[3783.50 → 3784.84] Jesus
[3784.84 → 3785.70] Says
[3785.70 → 3788.16] I tell
[3788.16 → 3788.46] You the
[3788.46 → 3788.82] Truth
[3788.82 → 3789.60] You are
[3789.60 → 3789.88] Looking
[3789.88 → 3790.40] For me
[3790.40 → 3790.98] Not because
[3790.98 → 3791.38] You saw
[3791.38 → 3792.00] Miraculous
[3792.00 → 3792.68] Signs
[3792.68 → 3793.30] But because
[3793.30 → 3793.74] You ate
[3793.74 → 3794.52] The loaves
[3794.52 → 3795.32] And had
[3795.32 → 3795.84] Your fill
[3795.84 → 3797.36] Jesus is
[3797.36 → 3797.88] Referring
[3797.88 → 3798.26] To the
[3798.26 → 3798.60] Miracle
[3798.60 → 3799.08] Of feeding
[3799.08 → 3799.30] The
[3799.30 → 3799.60] Five
[3799.60 → 3800.10] Thousand
[3800.10 → 3800.66] You will
[3800.66 → 3800.92] Remember
[3800.92 → 3801.50] He was
[3801.50 → 3801.86] Teaching
[3801.86 → 3802.94] On a
[3802.94 → 3803.46] Hillside
[3803.46 → 3803.82] And it
[3803.82 → 3804.32] Grew
[3804.32 → 3804.64] To the
[3804.64 → 3804.80] End
[3804.80 → 3805.00] Of the
[3805.00 → 3805.24] Day
[3805.24 → 3805.62] And people
[3805.62 → 3805.76] Were
[3805.76 → 3805.98] Getting
[3805.98 → 3806.44] Hungry
[3806.44 → 3807.06] And so
[3807.06 → 3807.22] They
[3807.22 → 3807.84] Collected
[3807.84 → 3808.66] Five loaves
[3808.66 → 3809.00] And two
[3809.00 → 3809.38] Fishes
[3809.38 → 3809.78] And
[3809.78 → 3810.54] They
[3810.54 → 3811.08] Jesus
[3811.08 → 3811.48] Started
[3811.48 → 3811.88] Breaking
[3811.88 → 3812.42] That up
[3812.42 → 3812.98] And passing
[3812.98 → 3813.34] It out
[3813.34 → 3813.80] For everyone
[3813.80 → 3814.24] To eat
[3814.24 → 3814.86] And five
[3814.86 → 3815.44] Thousand
[3815.44 → 3816.34] Men plus
[3816.34 → 3816.76] Women and
[3816.76 → 3817.04] Children
[3817.04 → 3817.52] Ate
[3817.52 → 3818.12] That day
[3818.12 → 3818.54] And were
[3818.54 → 3818.84] Filled
[3818.84 → 3819.42] The disciples
[3819.42 → 3819.90] Went and
[3819.90 → 3820.42] They collected
[3820.42 → 3821.36] Twelve baskets
[3821.36 → 3822.26] Of leftovers
[3822.26 → 3823.06] It was
[3823.06 → 3823.36] It was a
[3823.36 → 3824.12] Miracle
[3824.12 → 3825.22] Of multiplication
[3825.22 → 3827.22] And they
[3827.22 → 3828.58] Quite
[3828.58 → 3828.90] Literally
[3828.90 → 3829.54] Jesus is
[3829.54 → 3829.78] Saying
[3829.78 → 3829.98] They
[3829.98 → 3830.32] Left
[3830.32 → 3830.62] With
[3830.62 → 3830.86] Their
[3830.86 → 3831.68] Stomachs
[3831.68 → 3832.16] Full
[3832.16 → 3833.88] But he
[3833.88 → 3834.44] Reminds
[3834.44 → 3834.68] Them
[3834.68 → 3835.34] Of this
[3835.34 → 3836.64] And this
[3836.64 → 3837.38] Opportunity
[3837.38 → 3838.00] That they
[3838.00 → 3838.28] Came
[3838.28 → 3838.78] To find
[3838.78 → 3839.00] Him
[3839.00 → 3839.34] Now
[3839.34 → 3839.96] Because
[3839.96 → 3840.16] He
[3840.16 → 3840.38] Wants
[3840.38 → 3841.42] To expose
[3841.42 → 3842.44] To them
[3842.44 → 3843.64] The truth
[3843.64 → 3844.60] Of their
[3844.60 → 3845.64] Hearts
[3845.64 → 3847.26] He wants
[3847.26 → 3847.86] To reveal
[3847.86 → 3848.44] To them
[3848.44 → 3848.94] That what's
[3848.94 → 3849.48] Happening
[3849.48 → 3850.00] Here
[3850.00 → 3850.66] Right
[3850.66 → 3850.96] And what
[3850.96 → 3851.46] He is
[3851.46 → 3851.78] Giving
[3851.78 → 3852.40] Isn't
[3852.40 → 3852.82] Just
[3852.82 → 3853.28] A
[3853.28 → 3853.84] Physical
[3853.84 → 3854.84] Reality
[3854.84 → 3855.34] But there's
[3855.34 → 3855.58] Something
[3855.58 → 3856.32] Underneath
[3856.32 → 3856.48] It
[3856.48 → 3856.68] There's
[3856.68 → 3856.92] Something
[3856.92 → 3857.80] Deeper
[3857.80 → 3858.06] There's
[3858.06 → 3858.36] Something
[3858.36 → 3858.78] Even
[3858.78 → 3859.36] More
[3859.36 → 3859.92] Important
[3859.92 → 3860.28] Going
[3860.28 → 3860.74] On
[3860.74 → 3861.32] In their
[3861.32 → 3862.00] Interactions
[3862.00 → 3862.34] With
[3862.34 → 3862.68] Jesus
[3862.68 → 3863.12] And in
[3863.12 → 3863.28] With
[3863.28 → 3863.58] Meeting
[3863.58 → 3864.18] With
[3864.18 → 3864.54] Him
[3864.54 → 3865.10] Than
[3865.10 → 3865.68] Having
[3865.68 → 3865.92] Their
[3865.92 → 3866.30] Bellies
[3866.30 → 3866.58] Filled
[3866.58 → 3866.82] Although
[3866.82 → 3867.12] That is
[3867.12 → 3867.54] Important
[3867.54 → 3868.28] And
[3868.28 → 3868.86] Necessary
[3868.86 → 3869.36] But
[3869.36 → 3869.72] Here
[3869.72 → 3870.96] Jesus
[3870.96 → 3871.80] Says
[3871.80 → 3872.68] In
[3872.68 → 3872.86] Verse
[3872.86 → 3873.42] 29
[3873.42 → 3874.00] The
[3874.00 → 3874.32] Work
[3874.32 → 3874.58] Of
[3874.58 → 3874.90] God
[3874.90 → 3875.14] Is
[3875.14 → 3875.56] This
[3875.56 → 3876.46] To
[3876.46 → 3876.88] Believe
[3876.88 → 3877.40] In
[3877.40 → 3877.54] The
[3877.54 → 3877.90] One
[3877.90 → 3878.30] He
[3878.30 → 3878.74] Has
[3878.74 → 3879.60] Sent
[3879.60 → 3881.10] And so
[3881.10 → 3881.38] Jesus
[3881.38 → 3881.64] Says
[3881.64 → 3881.92] You've

[3883.32 → 3883.78] Physical
[3883.78 → 3884.54] Need
[3884.54 → 3884.78] But
[3884.78 → 3885.14] I've
[3885.14 → 3885.32] Come
[3885.32 → 3885.50] To
[3885.50 → 3885.78] You

[3898.94 → 3899.18] Will
[3899.18 → 3899.52] Explain
[3899.52 → 3899.86] Later
[3899.86 → 3900.28] That

[3905.30 → 3905.86] But
[3905.86 → 3906.06] There's
[3906.06 → 3906.26] A
[3906.26 → 3907.54] Deeper
[3907.54 → 3908.16] Meaning
[3908.16 → 3909.70] Going

[3910.38 → 3910.72] This
[3910.72 → 3911.90] Exchange
[3911.90 → 3913.56] And
[3913.56 → 3913.86] Yet
[3913.86 → 3915.58] The

[3916.04 → 3917.70] Want

[3923.72 → 3923.86] Who
[3923.86 → 3924.02] Has
[3924.02 → 3924.20] Sent
[3924.20 → 3924.34] Me

[4093.22 → 4093.64] And
[4093.64 → 4094.14] Going
[4094.14 → 4094.52] Back
[4094.52 → 4094.72] To
[4094.72 → 4094.96] This
[4094.96 → 4095.28] Idea
[4095.28 → 4095.48] That
[4095.48 → 4095.56] He
[4095.56 → 4095.68] Is
[4095.68 → 4096.24] Just
[4096.24 → 4096.64] A
[4096.64 → 4096.96] Man
[4096.96 → 4097.20] Just
[4097.20 → 4097.44] The
[4097.44 → 4097.70] Son
[4097.70 → 4098.30] Of
[4098.30 → 4098.70] Joseph
[4098.70 → 4099.78] They
[4099.78 → 4100.18] Continue
[4100.18 → 4100.48] That
[4100.48 → 4101.62] Rationalization
[4101.62 → 4103.18] In
[4103.18 → 4103.46] Verse
[4103.46 → 4104.00] 52
[4104.00 → 4104.28] They
[4104.28 → 4104.52] Began
[4104.52 → 4104.66] To
[4104.66 → 4105.00] Argue
[4105.00 → 4105.50] Sharply
[4105.50 → 4105.78] Among
[4105.78 → 4106.38] Themselves
[4106.38 → 4106.70] How
[4106.70 → 4106.98] Can
[4106.98 → 4107.26] This
[4107.26 → 4107.60] Man
[4107.60 → 4107.88] Give
[4107.88 → 4108.06] Us
[4108.06 → 4108.32] His
[4108.32 → 4108.88] Flesh
[4108.88 → 4109.60] To
[4109.60 → 4109.90] Eat
[4109.90 → 4110.10] Now
[4110.10 → 4110.96] Admittedly
[4110.96 → 4111.54] That's
[4111.54 → 4111.96] Weird

[4115.24 → 4115.52] About
[4115.52 → 4115.74] This
[4115.74 → 4115.92] What
[4115.92 → 4116.20] Jesus
[4116.20 → 4116.44] Is
[4116.44 → 4116.68] Saying
[4116.68 → 4116.92] Here
[4116.92 → 4117.22] Is
[4117.22 → 4118.16] Strange
[4118.16 → 4118.58] And
[4118.58 → 4119.26] Abnormal
[4119.26 → 4119.92] And
[4119.92 → 4120.70] Confusing
[4120.70 → 4122.64] And yet
[4122.64 → 4123.14] Remember
[4123.14 → 4123.58] He's
[4123.58 → 4124.30] Revealing
[4124.30 → 4124.98] Something
[4124.98 → 4126.00] Deeper
[4126.00 → 4126.50] About
[4126.50 → 4127.00] Us

[4127.44 → 4128.18] Our
[4128.18 → 4128.64] Need
[4128.64 → 4129.86] Right
[4129.86 → 4130.20] Jesus
[4130.20 → 4130.88] Mentions
[4130.88 → 4131.12] The
[4131.12 → 4131.46] Same
[4131.46 → 4131.68] And
[4131.68 → 4132.30] John
[4132.30 → 4132.90] Mentions

[4134.30 → 4134.48] Verse
[4134.48 → 4135.16] 66
[4135.16 → 4136.66] Because
[4136.66 → 4137.02] It's
[4137.02 → 4137.20] So
[4137.20 → 4137.52] Weird
[4137.52 → 4138.30] Right
[4138.30 → 4138.56] From
[4138.56 → 4138.84] This
[4138.84 → 4139.16] Time
[4139.16 → 4139.40] Many
[4139.40 → 4139.58] Of
[4139.58 → 4139.70] His
[4139.70 → 4140.24] Disciples
[4140.24 → 4140.72] Turned
[4140.72 → 4141.04] Back

[4141.28 → 4141.50] No
[4141.50 → 4142.00] Longer
[4142.00 → 4142.82] Followed
[4142.82 → 4143.40] Him
[4143.40 → 4145.16] Sometimes
[4145.16 → 4146.06] It is
[4146.06 → 4146.40] Really

[4151.56 → 4152.02] Weird
[4152.02 → 4152.52] Things
[4152.52 → 4152.78] That
[4152.78 → 4153.08] Jesus

[4153.58 → 4153.84] And
[4153.84 → 4153.98] To

[4154.96 → 4155.20] As
[4155.20 → 4155.32] A
[4155.32 → 4155.70] Result
[4155.70 → 4157.06] It's

[4157.30 → 4157.62] Easy
[4157.62 → 4157.92] In
[4157.92 → 4158.16] Our
[4158.16 → 4158.80] Society
[4158.80 → 4159.18] For
[4159.18 → 4159.78] People
[4159.78 → 4160.00] Who
[4160.00 → 4160.32] Don't

[4163.82 → 4164.32] Crazy
[4164.32 → 4164.70] For
[4164.70 → 4165.18] Believing
[4165.18 → 4165.50] In
[4165.50 → 4165.88] This
[4165.88 → 4166.80] Because
[4166.80 → 4167.46] Honestly
[4167.46 → 4169.66] By
[4169.66 → 4171.02] Worldly
[4171.02 → 4171.72] Standards
[4171.72 → 4172.50] Jesus
[4172.50 → 4172.92] Sounds
[4172.92 → 4173.06] A
[4173.06 → 4173.16] Little
[4173.16 → 4173.56] Crazy
[4173.56 → 4173.90] Here
[4173.90 → 4176.12] Right
[4176.12 → 4177.08] There's
[4177.08 → 4177.20] A
[4177.20 → 4177.42] Point
[4177.42 → 4177.64] That's
[4177.64 → 4177.82] Made
[4177.82 → 4178.02] By
[4178.02 → 4178.40] C.S.
[4178.46 → 4178.64] Lewis
[4178.64 → 4181.42] In
[4181.42 → 4182.50] Contrast
[4182.50 → 4182.80] To
[4182.80 → 4183.04] This
[4183.04 → 4183.48] Idea
[4183.48 → 4183.70] That
[4183.70 → 4183.96] Was
[4183.96 → 4184.64] Common
[4184.64 → 4184.96] Then
[4184.96 → 4185.12] And
[4185.12 → 4185.32] Still
[4185.32 → 4185.72] A
[4185.72 → 4185.82] Little
[4185.82 → 4186.00] Bit
[4186.00 → 4186.30] Common
[4186.30 → 4186.64] Now
[4186.64 → 4186.86] Where
[4186.86 → 4187.94] People
[4187.94 → 4188.14] Would
[4188.14 → 4188.38] Say
[4188.38 → 4188.54] You
[4188.54 → 4188.64] Know
[4188.64 → 4188.94] Jesus
[4188.94 → 4189.20] Is
[4189.20 → 4189.40] Just
[4189.40 → 4189.52] A
[4189.52 → 4189.70] Really
[4189.70 → 4189.90] Good
[4189.90 → 4190.28] Teacher
[4190.28 → 4191.38] Right
[4191.38 → 4191.50] And
[4191.50 → 4191.58] They
[4191.58 → 4191.68] Would
[4191.68 → 4191.80] Sort
[4191.80 → 4191.92] Of
[4191.92 → 4192.52] Minimize
[4192.52 → 4192.84] Him
[4192.84 → 4193.04] To
[4193.04 → 4193.28] That
[4193.28 → 4193.44] And
[4193.44 → 4193.82] Minimize
[4193.82 → 4194.06] His
[4194.06 → 4194.40] Teaching
[4194.40 → 4194.66] To
[4194.66 → 4195.10] Some
[4195.10 → 4195.18] Of
[4195.18 → 4195.30] The
[4195.30 → 4195.64] Moral
[4195.64 → 4196.10] Lessons
[4196.10 → 4196.30] He
[4196.30 → 4196.62] Gave
[4196.62 → 4196.80] That
[4196.80 → 4196.88] He
[4196.88 → 4197.04] Was
[4197.04 → 4197.26] Just
[4197.26 → 4197.40] A
[4197.40 → 4197.56] Good
[4197.56 → 4197.98] Teacher
[4197.98 → 4198.80] But
[4198.80 → 4199.02] This
[4199.02 → 4199.36] Idea
[4199.36 → 4199.56] That
[4199.56 → 4199.68] He
[4199.68 → 4199.84] Is
[4199.84 → 4200.16] Lord
[4200.16 → 4200.42] And
[4200.42 → 4200.84] Saviour
[4200.84 → 4201.56] I
[4201.56 → 4201.70] Don't
[4201.70 → 4201.86] I
[4201.86 → 4202.00] Don't
[4202.00 → 4202.18] Need
[4202.18 → 4202.44] That
[4202.44 → 4202.94] I'll
[4202.94 → 4203.08] Take
[4203.08 → 4203.20] The
[4203.20 → 4203.68] Teachings
[4203.68 → 4203.88] Because
[4203.88 → 4204.18] That's
[4204.18 → 4204.40] Good
[4204.40 → 4205.32] What
[4205.32 → 4205.68] Lewis
[4205.68 → 4206.14] Does
[4206.14 → 4206.68] And
[4206.68 → 4206.86] Says
[4206.86 → 4207.32] Actually
[4207.32 → 4207.58] If
[4207.58 → 4207.70] You
[4207.70 → 4207.92] Look
[4207.92 → 4208.04] At
[4208.04 → 4208.16] The
[4208.16 → 4208.58] Teachings
[4208.58 → 4208.70] Of
[4208.70 → 4209.02] Jesus
[4209.02 → 4210.00] There
[4210.00 → 4210.14] Are
[4210.14 → 4210.40] Only
[4210.40 → 4210.68] Three
[4210.68 → 4240.68] 
[4240.68 → 4247.64] right, so this is Jesus sounding a little bit crazy right and good teachers aren't lunatics
[4247.64 → 4258.12] or Jesus said what he said, and it's actually true and if that's the case lewis said the only option
[4258.12 → 4268.44] for understanding Jesus is that he is lord saviour and god lewis goes on to make the point
[4268.44 → 4277.26] that there is no room or reason to call him only a good teacher he's either a liar a lunatic
[4277.26 → 4284.32] or the lord and if you read your New Testament bible there's really only one conclusion Jesus is
[4284.32 → 4288.96] lord and yet the difficulty of that is
[4288.96 → 4298.08] is the mystery of our faith, and it makes sense that people would try to rationalize that or
[4298.08 → 4304.86] explain it away or dismiss him as a result, and we do the same thing in our own way some of us do
[4304.86 → 4310.20] this explicitly some of us have done this explicitly for a really long time, and we're only now beginning
[4310.20 → 4317.12] to ask the kinds of hard questions of self-discernment but many of us do this more subtly
[4317.12 → 4322.78] right not actually believing that what Jesus says about himself is true
[4322.78 → 4330.90] not actually believing like uh Dave prayed earlier that that god has plans for us plans to prosper us
[4330.90 → 4338.30] and give us hope right, but we walk through life going this is all meaningless and this is pointless
[4338.30 → 4348.34] in fact uh there's a this past week I started reading a book uh by Richard loveless
[4348.34 → 4356.12] it's a book from the 70s it was first published in the 70s uh he's a scholar who has uh studied the
[4356.12 → 4363.58] history of revivals in the Christian church, and it's a fascinating read uh and when he is writing
[4363.58 → 4374.12] about in uh in his long book uh revival in local churches um he makes this note about the importance
[4374.12 → 4379.90] of a hearing and preaching the gospel uh week in and week out about being radically grounded
[4379.90 → 4385.30] in what Jesus says about himself and about you by implication he says the following he says
[4385.30 → 4392.08] Christians who are no longer sure that god loves and accepts them in Jesus apart from their present
[4392.08 → 4399.22] spiritual achievements that is to say when we go around believing that I have to hang on to god
[4399.22 → 4404.84] that I have to do this that I have to check all these boxes of holy habits that the pastor is
[4404.84 → 4410.86] talking about through the month of June that's how I will keep my relationship to god when we go
[4410.86 → 4417.44] around believing that we are subconsciously radically insecure persons
[4417.44 → 4425.32] the reason we need the gospel the reason we need Jesus to expose the spiritual realities
[4425.32 → 4432.72] of our hearts is because as soon as we make it about us, we make it an impossible truth but when it's
[4432.72 → 4440.96] about Jesus and what he is doing in you and for you and how he holds on to you in life and in faith
[4440.96 → 4452.30] then it becomes something life giving it changes reality and how you perceive reality in the midst of it
[4452.30 → 4463.58] and yet we need that reminder whether we do it subtly or explicitly we try to rationalize it away and
[4463.58 → 4470.56] then we know what it means to be these radically insecure faithless people
[4470.56 → 4481.56] Jesus interacting with them then gives them this hard teaching right the
[4481.56 → 4488.44] on hearing this truth that the spiritual reality is greater than the physical one and that the
[4488.44 → 4494.36] purpose for which Jesus came is greater than and more mysterious than they could even understand
[4494.36 → 4503.26] and the person who has come to them is the lord of the universe they said this is a hard teaching
[4503.26 → 4508.90] but John Calvin has this beautiful line on this in his commentary on the text he says
[4508.90 → 4521.68] the hardness was in their heart not in the teaching right it's a hardness of heart that is and that makes this hard to accept
[4521.68 → 4536.96] it's a hardness of heart that that makes us want to minimize and mitigate who Jesus is and the role that his voice speaks to us
[4536.96 → 4546.60] but Jesus there too recognizing the hardness of heart has an answer and addresses that reality
[4546.60 → 4549.84] in verse 53 he says
[4549.84 → 4560.22] I tell you the truth unless you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you
[4560.22 → 4571.36] whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink
[4571.36 → 4577.88] whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me and i in him just as the living father sent me
[4577.88 → 4583.14] and I live because of the father so the one who feeds on me will live because of me
[4583.14 → 4592.54] this is the bread that came down from heaven your fathers ate manna and died but whoever feeds on this bread will live forever
[4592.54 → 4606.22] now remember Jesus is using a spiritual using spiritual language a spiritual metaphor to point us to a greater reality
[4606.22 → 4614.16] and a greater need and the reality is the hard teaching that Jesus is presenting here is that
[4614.16 → 4620.78] there is nothing that you can do to earn the grace and favour of god
[4620.78 → 4627.10] that you are dead in your transgressions and sins as the apostle Paul says
[4627.10 → 4635.76] but that you are made alive by the gospel of grace by Christ jesus says unless you
[4635.76 → 4640.96] take me in unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood unless you become me
[4640.96 → 4646.66] right what we're talking about here pastor Kevin introduced this concept to us a little while ago
[4646.66 → 4652.52] but it's a good reminder we're talking about here is the doctrine the theological truth of double
[4652.52 → 4659.48] imputation now I recognize this is a theological concept so we're going to dig for just a minute bear with me
[4659.48 → 4665.36] double imputation so to impute something is to give it over to someone else right you
[4665.36 → 4671.90] impute something you give it to them, and it becomes theirs, or it becomes them double imputation
[4671.90 → 4681.70] is the theological truth that in his life Jesus lived perfectly and so each week when I give you
[4681.70 → 4685.82] the summary of the gospel and I say Jesus lived the life I should have lived and died the death that i
[4685.82 → 4692.18] deserved that's double imputation right he lived the life I should have lived so he perfectly obeyed all the
[4692.18 → 4700.86] commands of god he was perfectly holy and did everything that god requires of his people and
[4700.86 → 4709.54] which we daily prove that we cannot do he did it perfectly, and he gives that over to us, he imputes it
[4709.54 → 4715.84] that's the first imputation so that when god now looks at you, he doesn't see your sin instead he sees
[4715.84 → 4722.40] Jesus he sees Jesus perfect righteousness he sees what Jesus accomplished and did that we could not and
[4722.40 → 4732.12] he has given that to you, you are now defined by his life of obedience not by yours and imputation works
[4732.12 → 4736.22] the other way Jesus lived the life I should have lived and died the death that I deserve that is
[4736.22 → 4746.78] he bore the punishment of god for my sin right that he who knew no sin became sin for us that we might
[4746.78 → 4752.94] become the righteousness of god whose sin did he become mine thank you for those of you who pointed
[4752.94 → 4763.48] at yourself there and not at me my sin your sin individually our sin is imputed onto him that's the
[4763.48 → 4771.40] second imputation that's why it's double, and we need both right we need his righteousness, and he needs
[4771.40 → 4779.00] to take our sin and the punishment that our sin bears if we don't have both there is no salvation
[4782.20 → 4788.92] this is the hard teaching and Jesus response to our spiritual need that he has done it all that you
[4788.92 → 4798.36] have to take in him his righteousness his life such that when the father looks at you, he sees his only
[4798.60 → 4805.72] begotten son whom he loves you are looked at with that same love
[4808.68 → 4815.24] and so here's the payoff okay here's where this has all been building to for us this morning
[4815.24 → 4830.52] peter says lord to whom shall we go you have the words of eternal life we believe and know that you
[4831.24 → 4837.56] are the holy one now hold that in your mind keep that verse there maybe keep a finger on it and
[4837.56 → 4846.28] listen as I read here in verse 35 I am the bread of life he who comes to me will never go hungry and he
[4846.28 → 4855.80] who believes in me will never be thirsty right now take that and then with another finger or hand
[4855.80 → 4860.12] keeping that in your mind look at verse 63 and I'm picturing you all now with three hands pointing at
[4860.12 → 4866.68] different places on the bible verse 63 the spirit gives life the flesh counts for nothing the words
[4866.68 → 4877.08] I have spoken to you are spirit, and they are life you have the words of eternal life the words I have
[4877.08 → 4885.32] spoken to you in the spirit are life I am the bread of life he who comes to me will never go hungry and he
[4885.32 → 4893.24] who believes in me will never be thirsty when Jesus says you have to take in my flesh he is primarily
[4893.24 → 4901.40] talking about taking in his word he's primarily talking about taking in how he is revealed through
[4901.40 → 4911.08] the gospel of grace through the revelation of god to the world right what we are learning here what Jesus is
[4911.08 → 4920.28] is showing us here is that his voice is the source of our life in him
[4924.92 → 4935.72] and so as we come to the holy habit of scripture reading what we come to hear is the very love of god
[4935.72 → 4942.84] for his people made flesh in Jesus Christ the word became flesh john says and made his dwelling among us
[4942.84 → 4953.16] and is now offered to us in these pages so far from a dry and dusty book that belongs in the little
[4953.16 → 4965.48] cabinet beside your dining table this is the word of life I want to come back to uh loveless Richard
[4965.48 → 4971.00] loveless in his book on revivals talking about the importance of this kind of preaching to redeem and
[4971.00 → 4979.00] to call people to a new level of faithfulness and expression of faith in god he grounds us in this truth
[4979.80 → 4987.56] when he says there is a sense in which the strongest self-love that we can have and this is why I love this
[4987.56 → 4993.16] quote because we live in an age where we talk about self-love and self-help and self-care and needing to do
[4993.16 → 4997.96] this right and needing to do that to make sure that we have enough the strongest self-love that we
[4997.96 → 5009.00] can have is merely the mirror image of the lively conviction that we have that god loves us what is the
[5009.00 → 5017.96] the best form of self-love that you can have in practice the truth that god loves you and that Jesus has come
[5017.96 → 5023.96] and live the life you should have lived and died the death that you deserve that is what we need to
[5023.96 → 5035.80] remind ourselves and that is what we hear and find in the word Jesus says I am the good shepherd
[5037.00 → 5046.44] my sheep know me my sheep know my voice lord to whom shall we go you have the words of eternal life
[5046.44 → 5055.08] go to the good shepherd know his voice right Paul writes that the word of god is alive and active
[5055.08 → 5062.28] it is sharper than any double-edged sword hear this it penetrates even dividing soul and spirit joints
[5062.28 → 5072.44] and marrow the word of god gets into you deeply and reveals the truth to you, it judges the thoughts and the attitudes
[5072.44 → 5078.76] of the heart this is the inward aspect of this holy habit the word gets in you, and it reveals
[5079.40 → 5087.88] the truths of god to you, and it applies the love of god for you and over you, and we read that all
[5087.88 → 5094.12] scripture is god-breathed and useful for teaching rebuking correcting and training in righteousness
[5094.12 → 5102.04] this is the outward aspect right that we are to be a community that speaks the truth of god to
[5102.04 → 5107.80] each other that speaks the gospel over each other that learns how to take the truth of the gospel and
[5107.80 → 5114.52] apply it to the everyday circumstances of our lives and sometimes that looks like you needing to teach me
[5114.52 → 5119.56] sometimes that looks like you needing to rebuke me sometimes that looks like you needing to correct
[5119.56 → 5125.00] me sometimes that looks like you training me in righteousness as we discern life and faith together
[5125.00 → 5132.76] sometimes it looks like me doing the same for you, but we are all together learning how to do this and to
[5132.76 → 5135.32] move in this direction
[5139.88 → 5141.08] the word of god
[5141.08 → 5152.04] the word of god is the fuel of our eternal life in Jesus, and it is the means of our connection to him
[5152.04 → 5162.20] as we are grafted in by grace through faith now of course sometimes those spiritual concepts
[5163.16 → 5170.52] are hard to grab and hard to grasp and so you will remember that I said that Jesus is talking primarily
[5171.64 → 5183.32] about the word, but the word is connected to the supper right the grace of god that is offered in the
[5183.32 → 5190.12] words of Jesus Christ the grace of god that is offered in the preaching of the gospel is the same grace
[5191.00 → 5196.36] is the same Jesus that's revealed here at the word or at the table
[5196.36 → 5206.44] and so even as we proclaim the goodness of god in the gospel we receive the goodness of god in the
[5206.44 → 5213.24] gospel here at the table even as you are invited to eat and drink of the lord Jesus of his word
[5213.24 → 5223.48] the word we now get to eat and drink of the lord Jesus made real really present here among us
[5223.48 → 5233.80] in the bread and in the juice the concrete expression of the holy habit of being found in the word is lived
[5233.80 → 5246.20] here at the table here at the table here we find Jesus just like here we heard from him so as we come to
[5246.20 → 5253.80] this table know that you are coming to Jesus as we come to this table, and you take him in with the bread
[5253.80 → 5260.12] and with the juice know that you are taking in the word of faith as we come to this table may you be
[5260.12 → 5270.92] strengthened and nourished and that in him and him alone we might have eternal life we're going to come
[5270.92 → 5276.92] to this table with a bit of a liturgy it's going to invite you to speak some words that will be on the
[5276.92 → 5286.28] screen there, and then we will move through I will explain that process later we come to the table of our lord
[5286.28 → 5291.88] as the bride of Christ to the feast of the king and so lift your hearts
[5295.32 → 5297.88] let us give thanks to the lord our god
[5302.28 → 5303.08] let's pray together
[5305.48 → 5311.88] with joy we praise you gracious god for you have created heaven and earth you have made us in your
[5311.88 → 5318.44] your image you have kept covenant with us even when we fell into sin, and so we give you thanks for
[5318.44 → 5329.00] Jesus Christ who by his life death and resurrection open to us the way of everlasting life amen
[5331.64 → 5341.48] Jesus before he suffered and died gave us this memorial of his sacrifice until he comes again
[5342.52 → 5351.32] the lord Jesus on the night that he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said
[5351.56 → 5364.28] this is my body which is for you do this in remembrance of me in the same way after supper he
[5364.28 → 5375.72] took the cup saying this cup is the new covenant in my blood do this in remembrance of me for whenever
[5375.72 → 5383.24] we eat this bread and drink this cup we proclaim the lord's death and his resurrection until he comes
[5383.80 → 5389.80] again this is the mystery of our faith
[5389.80 → 5403.32] coming we wait with hope glory be to you lord Jesus
[5403.32 → 5416.76] church family the lord has prepared his table for all who love him and who trust in him alone for their salvation and so come to this table

[6156.36 → 6167.98] And I, the guilty one, made one way.
[6167.98 → 6180.98] Amazing love, oh what sacrifice the Son of God is giving for me.
[6180.98 → 6200.98] My daddy days and my daddy times, that I'm my place, that I'm my end.
[6200.98 → 6218.22] And so they watched and died, despised, rejected.
[6218.22 → 6232.22] But all the money's share, bought for me.
[6232.22 → 6245.22] Amazing love, oh what sacrifice the Son of God gives for me.
