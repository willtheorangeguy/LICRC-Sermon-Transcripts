[100.60 → 108.60] I raise a hallelujah.
[108.60 → 112.60] I will watch the darkness flee.
[112.60 → 123.60] I raise a hallelujah in the middle of the mystery.
[123.60 → 128.60] I raise a hallelujah.
[128.60 → 131.60] I'll raise a hallelujah.
[131.60 → 135.60] I feel you lost your hold on me.
[135.60 → 142.60] I'm going to sing in the middle of the storm.
[142.60 → 148.60] Louder and louder, you're going to hear my praises roar.
[148.60 → 149.60] levels roar.

[247.50 → 248.16] Our greats
[248.16 → 248.60] Have a great day
[248.60 → 249.78] We were peaceful
[249.78 → 250.72] EE
[250.72 → 267.12] The Grand Earth has quaked before
[267.12 → 273.94] Moved by the sound of His voice
[273.94 → 280.16] And seas that are shaken and stirred
[280.16 → 286.72] Can be calmed and broken for my regard
[286.72 → 292.24] And through it all, through it all
[292.24 → 295.32] My eyes are on you
[295.32 → 299.48] And through it all, through it all
[299.48 → 300.98] It is well
[300.98 → 307.04] And through it all, through it all

[310.08 → 312.50] And it is well
[312.50 → 315.60] With me
[315.60 → 331.66] Far be it from me to not believe
[331.66 → 338.66] Even when my eyes can't see
[338.66 → 344.76] And this mountain that's in front of me
[344.76 → 351.38] Will be thrown into the midst of the sea
[351.38 → 357.44] And through it all, through it all
[357.44 → 360.48] My eyes are on you
[360.48 → 364.10] And through it all, through it all
[364.10 → 365.60] It is well
[365.60 → 371.82] And through it all, through it all
[371.82 → 374.88] My eyes are on you
[374.88 → 377.88] And it is well
[377.88 → 381.82] It is well
[381.82 → 386.20] So let go, my soul
[386.20 → 389.56] And trust in Him
[389.56 → 391.52] The waves and wind
[391.52 → 396.58] Still know His name
[396.58 → 400.62] So let go, my soul
[400.62 → 403.62] And trust in Him
[403.62 → 405.00] The waves and wind
[405.00 → 410.78] Still know His name
[410.78 → 415.08] So let go, my soul
[415.08 → 417.84] And trust in Him
[417.84 → 419.52] The waves and wind
[419.52 → 422.86] Still know His name
[422.86 → 424.82] The waves and wind
[424.82 → 427.04] Still know His name
[427.04 → 434.04] The waves and winds still know His name.
[437.04 → 448.04] And it is well with my soul.
[448.04 → 450.04] Sing it out.
[450.04 → 464.04] It is well with my soul.
[465.04 → 479.04] It is well with my soul.
[479.04 → 484.04] It is well.
[484.04 → 492.04] It is well with my soul.
[492.04 → 493.04] Sing it out.
[493.04 → 495.04] It is well.
[495.04 → 499.04] Oh, it is well.
[499.04 → 502.04] It is well.
[502.04 → 515.04] It is well with my soul.
[515.04 → 518.04] Good morning, everyone.
[518.04 → 520.04] Welcome to church this morning.
[520.04 → 526.04] Those of you who are here, those of you who are joining us online this morning, it is good to see so many faces.
[526.04 → 530.04] And I don't know, later I will check out the YouTube views and see those faces too, I guess.
[530.04 → 534.04] We are gathered here today to hear God's word, to sing His praises.
[534.04 → 538.04] Of course, I've got a couple of announcements this morning before we begin.
[538.04 → 548.04] The first is an announcement for anybody who was in choir this past Christmas season, but also this past whenever season, the past two, three, five years.
[548.04 → 553.04] If you have music at home or folders at home, can you please return those to Mark?
[553.04 → 554.04] Mark is somewhere.
[554.04 → 555.04] There he is.
[555.04 → 556.04] He's on the piano.
[556.04 → 557.04] Bring them to Mark.
[557.04 → 558.04] You can give it to him at church.
[558.04 → 560.04] You can put it in his mailbox in the back there.
[560.04 → 562.04] You don't have to drop by his house.
[562.04 → 563.04] Like, we can leave the poor guy alone that way.
[563.04 → 565.04] But like, bring it to church.
[565.04 → 566.04] Bring the music back to him there.
[566.04 → 569.04] And then we can kind of make a collection and go from there.
[569.04 → 570.04] The second is for youth.
[570.04 → 574.04] Youth tonight, if you're in grades nine to 12, we have HCBC tonight.
[574.04 → 577.04] So come on out at seven o'clock for Belgic Confession and Catechism.
[577.04 → 579.04] We'll see you then.
[579.04 → 582.04] I am going to invite you all to rise.
[582.04 → 585.04] I believe we're doing God's greeting right now, right?
[585.04 → 587.04] I didn't have...
[587.04 → 590.04] All right.
[590.04 → 596.04] God's greeting this morning comes to us from Revelation chapter one, where it says this.
[596.04 → 597.04] Please receive God's greeting.
[597.04 → 603.04] Grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven
[603.04 → 609.04] spirits that are before his throne, and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness,
[609.04 → 614.04] the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth.
[614.04 → 616.04] And all God's people said, amen.
[616.04 → 617.04] Take a moment.
[617.04 → 620.04] We're not going to shake hands, but take a moment, give some winks, some nods, look around,
[620.04 → 622.04] say hi, take 30 seconds to do that.
[622.04 → 624.04] Text some people if you're at home as well.
[624.04 → 625.04] Just a moment.
[625.04 → 626.04] Jesus.
[626.04 → 639.04] Hope of the nations.
[639.04 → 653.44] Jesus, hope of the nations, there is none like you, O Lord, nor are there any works like yours.
[654.10 → 660.72] All the nations you have made shall come and bow down before you, O Lord, and shall glorify your name.
[661.50 → 666.38] For you are the great and do wondrous things, for you alone are God.
[669.04 → 670.04] Amen.
[682.98 → 697.04] Jesus, hope of the nations, Jesus, comfort for all who mourn, you are the source of heaven's hope on earth.
[698.04 → 705.60] Jesus, light in the darkness, Jesus, truth in each circumstance.
[707.04 → 712.48] You are the source of heaven's light on earth.
[712.48 → 720.48] In history you lived and died, you broke the chains, you rose to life.
[721.48 → 734.48] You are the hope living in us, you are the rock in whom we trust, you are the light shining for all the world to see.
[734.48 → 744.48] You rose from the dead, conquering fear, our prince of peace, drawing us near.
[744.48 → 750.48] Jesus, our hope living for all who will receive.
[751.48 → 753.48] Lord, we believe.
[753.48 → 775.48] Jesus, hope of the nations, Jesus, comfort for all who mourn, you are the source of heaven's hope on earth.
[775.48 → 783.48] Jesus, light in the darkness, Jesus, truth in each circumstance.
[783.48 → 791.48] Jesus, light in the darkness, you are the source of heaven's light on earth.
[792.48 → 799.48] Jesus, light in the darkness, you are the hope living in us.
[799.48 → 814.48] You are the rock in whom we trust, you are the light shining for all the world to see.
[814.48 → 822.48] You rose from the dead, conquering fear, our prince of peace, drawing us near.
[823.48 → 829.48] Jesus, our hope living for all who will receive.
[830.48 → 833.48] Lord, we believe.
[834.48 → 837.48] Lord, we believe.
[838.48 → 842.48] Lord, we believe.
[844.48 → 867.48] Lord, we believe.
[867.48 → 872.78] Worthy of all the praise we could ever bring.
[875.56 → 880.20] Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe.
[880.52 → 882.42] We live for you.
[890.04 → 895.18] Jesus, the name above every other name.
[897.48 → 902.68] Jesus, the only one who could ever sing.
[905.08 → 909.68] Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe.
[909.86 → 911.94] We live for you.
[913.06 → 915.50] Oh, we live for you.
[918.60 → 923.70] Holy, there is no one like you.
[923.70 → 926.70] There is none beside you.
[927.48 → 932.68] Open up my eyes in wonder.
[932.68 → 936.56] And show me who you are.
[936.56 → 940.30] And fill me with your heart.
[940.30 → 948.30] And lead me in your love to those around me.
[948.30 → 955.50] Jesus, the name above every other name.
[955.50 → 968.70] Jesus, the name above every other name.
[968.70 → 976.58] Jesus, the only one who could ever sing.
[976.58 → 981.78] Jesus, the only one who could ever breathe.
[981.78 → 982.98] We live for you.
[982.98 → 983.18] Jesus, the only one who could ever breathe.
[983.18 → 984.98] We live for you.
[984.98 → 985.98] Jesus, the only one who could ever breathe.
[985.98 → 986.98] We live for you.
[986.98 → 988.98] Oh, we live for you.
[988.98 → 997.18] Holy, there is no one like you.
[997.18 → 1000.18] There is none beside you.
[1000.18 → 1005.38] Open up my eyes in wonder.
[1005.38 → 1009.58] And show me who you are.
[1009.58 → 1014.02] And fill me with your heart.
[1014.02 → 1021.58] And lead me in your love to those around me.
[1021.58 → 1039.78] And I will build my life upon your love.
[1039.78 → 1050.98] It is a firm foundation.
[1050.98 → 1058.78] And I will put my trust in you alone.
[1058.78 → 1065.78] And I will not be shaken.
[1065.78 → 1073.78] And I will build my life upon your love.
[1073.78 → 1079.78] It is a firm foundation.
[1079.78 → 1088.78] And I will put my trust in you alone.
[1088.78 → 1094.78] And I will not be shaken.
[1094.78 → 1100.78] Holy, there is no one like you.
[1100.78 → 1104.78] There is none beside you.
[1104.78 → 1110.78] Open up my eyes in wonder.
[1110.78 → 1114.78] And show me who you are.
[1114.78 → 1118.78] And fill me with your heart.
[1118.78 → 1128.78] And lead me in your love to those around me.
[1128.78 → 1135.78] Lord, we gather before you to worship you.
[1135.78 → 1138.78] We sing praises of your greatness.
[1138.78 → 1142.78] That you are worthy of all the praise we could ever bring.
[1142.78 → 1145.78] There is no one like you, oh God.
[1145.78 → 1148.78] We sing of how we will build our foundation.
[1148.78 → 1151.78] The foundation of our life on your love.
[1151.78 → 1153.78] How we will put our trust in you alone.
[1153.78 → 1156.78] And we will not be shaken.
[1156.78 → 1163.78] How often, oh Lord, do we leave this place and leave our awareness of you at the door.
[1163.78 → 1168.78] How often do we enter back into the fear, the anger, the pain, the heartache,
[1168.78 → 1170.78] forgetting who you are.
[1170.78 → 1174.78] Forgetting who we are in you.
[1174.78 → 1179.78] Those who know you, who know your name, put their trust in you.
[1179.78 → 1183.78] For you, oh Lord, have not forsaken those who seek you.
[1183.78 → 1188.78] Let your name be on our lips, both in our need and in our joys.
[1188.78 → 1193.78] That we may find you always there beside us to give us hope and strength.
[1193.78 → 1195.78] In your name we pray, amen.
[1195.78 → 1196.78] We pray, amen.
[1196.78 → 1197.78] We pray, amen.
[1197.78 → 1198.78] But every name is God.
[1198.78 → 1199.78] We pray, amen.
[1199.78 → 1200.78] Thank you, amen.
[1200.78 → 1201.78] Thank you.

[1246.64 → 1253.86] For those who trust God's changeless love

[1282.70 → 1289.62] With what discerning love has sent
[1289.62 → 1296.52] Doubt not our inmost wants are known
[1296.52 → 1303.52] To Him who chose us for His own
[1303.52 → 1311.52] Pray and keep His ways unswerving
[1311.52 → 1317.52] Offer your service faithfully
[1317.52 → 1324.52] And trust His word, though undeserving
[1324.52 → 1331.52] You'll find His promise true to be
[1331.52 → 1338.52] God will never forsake in need
[1338.52 → 1345.52] To a soul that trusts in Him
[1345.52 → 1346.52] Indeed
[1346.52 → 1349.52] Indeed
[1349.52 → 1351.52] Amen.
[1379.52 → 1398.32] I know for sure all of my days are held in your hand, crafted into your perfect plan.
[1398.32 → 1411.92] You gently call me into your presence, guiding me by your Holy Spirit.
[1411.92 → 1424.78] Teach me, dear Lord, to live all my life through your eyes.
[1424.78 → 1430.60] I'm captured by your holy calling.
[1431.60 → 1440.10] Set me apart, I know you're drawing me to yourself.
[1440.82 → 1444.66] Lead me, Lord, I pray.
[1444.66 → 1460.48] Take me, mould me, use me, fill me.
[1460.48 → 1469.30] I give my life to the potter's hand.
[1469.30 → 1479.12] Call me, guide me.
[1479.12 → 1485.12] Lead me, walk beside me.
[1485.12 → 1495.32] I give my life to the potter's hand.
[1495.32 → 1506.94] Beautiful Lord, wonderful Saviour, I know for sure.
[1506.94 → 1520.48] All of my days are held in your hand, crafted into your perfect plan.
[1522.48 → 1530.94] You gently call me into your presence, guiding me by.
[1530.94 → 1546.64] Your Holy Spirit, teach me, dear Lord, to live all my life through your eyes.
[1546.64 → 1552.64] I'm captured by your holy calling.
[1552.64 → 1561.50] Set me apart, I know you're drawing me to yourself.
[1561.50 → 1566.34] Lead me, Lord, I pray.
[1566.34 → 1582.34] Take me, mould me, use me, fill me.
[1582.34 → 1590.34] I give my life to the potter's hand.
[1590.34 → 1620.32] Take me, Lord, I pray.
[1620.34 → 1622.50] You may be seated.
[1622.50 → 1643.16] Good morning.
[1643.16 → 1646.92] Good morning.
[1646.92 → 1648.92] Good morning.
[1648.92 → 1653.20] Today, this week's offering is to support the operations and ministries and missions
[1653.20 → 1656.48] of our church by supporting our budget.
[1656.48 → 1661.34] And the special offering today is for the World Renew Food Grains Bank.
[1661.34 → 1665.82] Next week, the offering will be for the budget as well as for the Gateway Hope Shelter here
[1665.82 → 1667.36] in our neighbourhood.
[1667.36 → 1671.32] So World Renew, as many of you know, is a CRC organization that has an account with the
[1671.32 → 1672.32] Canadian Food Grains Bank.
[1672.32 → 1679.46] And they can draw on that and then support various projects and so forth that they have
[1679.46 → 1680.88] all around the world.
[1680.88 → 1686.32] They are currently quite busy because of COVID-19 and the shortages in various parts of the world,
[1686.32 → 1690.32] the droughts, the war, the conflict and so forth.
[1690.32 → 1696.60] So, currently, the Canadian government is matching donations four to one, which is amazing.
[1696.60 → 1701.60] So, your gift will go five times as far as it would normally.

[1943.36 → 1949.36] If you're four and under, come on up for the children's blessing.
[1949.36 → 1959.36] And I have a few little questions for you guys to introduce today's lesson in children's worship time.
[1959.36 → 1965.36] Oh man, there are lots of you guys today. Church is really full today. That's kind of nice.
[1965.36 → 1969.36] I have some questions for you guys, as usual.
[1969.36 → 1972.36] I wasn't organized enough to get this on the screen.
[1972.36 → 1974.36] Do you guys know who this lady is?
[1974.36 → 1976.36] The Queen.
[1976.36 → 1978.36] That was quick.
[1978.36 → 1981.36] All right, Queen Elizabeth. Let's see. Let's see another picture.
[1981.36 → 1983.36] That is Queen Elizabeth.
[1983.36 → 1985.36] Do you know who this guy is?
[1985.36 → 1988.36] Not the king, thankfully.
[1988.36 → 1989.36] Yeah.
[1989.36 → 1991.36] Huh?
[1991.36 → 1995.36] Anyone know who this guy is?
[1995.36 → 1998.36] A church man? Not quite.
[1998.36 → 2001.36] We don't know him because of that.
[2001.36 → 2004.36] Is he a man who works in a big office?
[2004.36 → 2007.36] He does work in a huge office.
[2007.36 → 2011.36] Oh, he's not a doctor. That's an important person, too.
[2011.36 → 2013.36] This is the Prime Minister of Canada.
[2014.36 → 2016.36] Prime Minister Trudeau. Right?
[2017.36 → 2019.36] That's one more picture. Who's this guy?
[2021.36 → 2022.36] Pastor Chris.
[2022.36 → 2024.36] He's also an important guy.
[2024.36 → 2025.36] Do you know what is one thing?
[2025.36 → 2026.36] I picked up some pictures.
[2026.36 → 2028.36] These are all different leaders.
[2028.36 → 2030.36] From whom?
[2030.36 → 2031.36] Leaders of people.
[2031.36 → 2034.36] Leaders of important things.
[2034.36 → 2038.36] Do you guys know of any leaders in your life?
[2038.36 → 2039.36] Pastor Chris is in your life.
[2039.36 → 2041.36] We see him all the time.
[2041.36 → 2043.36] Who are other leaders in your life?
[2043.36 → 2044.36] God.
[2044.36 → 2046.36] God is a huge leader in our life.
[2046.36 → 2047.36] Who's another leader?
[2047.36 → 2049.36] Your mom and dad.
[2049.36 → 2054.36] OMA and OPA are leaders in many ways.
[2054.36 → 2057.36] Jesus is an amazing leader.
[2057.36 → 2059.36] What do you think, Malachi?
[2059.36 → 2061.36] Grandma and grandpas are leaders.
[2061.36 → 2063.36] Did you have one, Ila?
[2063.36 → 2066.36] Aunts and uncles can be leaders.
[2066.36 → 2068.36] Others may be teachers.
[2068.36 → 2071.36] We even have worship leaders in front of the church.
[2071.36 → 2073.36] Lots of people who lead.
[2073.36 → 2076.36] What makes a good leader?
[2076.36 → 2078.36] This could be interesting.
[2078.36 → 2080.36] What makes a good leader?
[2080.36 → 2084.36] Who helps the team out?
[2084.36 → 2086.36] That is such a good answer.
[2086.36 → 2089.36] What are other things that make a good leader?
[2089.36 → 2093.36] Jesus helps people be good leaders for sure.
[2093.36 → 2095.36] What are other characteristics?
[2095.36 → 2098.36] Are they people who are in charge of stuff?
[2098.36 → 2099.36] Yeah.
[2099.36 → 2102.36] Do leaders do everything by themselves?
[2102.36 → 2104.36] They are not supposed to, right?
[2104.36 → 2106.36] They are supposed to have followers.
[2106.36 → 2108.36] They are supposed to have a team.
[2108.36 → 2109.36] Yeah.
[2109.36 → 2114.36] So, another characteristic about a leader is someone who is also very patient.
[2114.36 → 2115.36] That's a tricky one.
[2115.36 → 2120.36] So, we are going to talk a lot more today in children's worship time about good leading
[2120.36 → 2123.36] and about patient leaders.
[2123.36 → 2125.36] What's that, Hayley?
[2125.36 → 2126.36] What does that mean?
[2126.36 → 2128.36] What does that mean?
[2128.36 → 2129.36] What does that mean?
[2129.36 → 2130.36] What does that mean?
[2130.36 → 2131.36] What does that mean?
[2131.36 → 2132.36] Is it that leaders need water?
[2132.36 → 2133.36] Oh!
[2133.36 → 2134.36] Yeah.
[2134.36 → 2135.36] Sometimes leaders need water too.
[2135.36 → 2136.36] That's right.
[2136.36 → 2137.36] Yep.
[2137.36 → 2138.36] Yep.
[2138.36 → 2139.36] They keep hydrated.
[2139.36 → 2141.36] Another great characteristic of a leader.
[2141.36 → 2142.36] Sure.
[2142.36 → 2146.36] Why don't we stand, and we'll do the children's blessing, and then we'll talk more about patience
[2146.36 → 2153.92] and leadership in children's worship time. All right, arms up, extend to the
[2153.92 → 2161.10] congregation, ready? The Lord be with you. All right, let's go to children's worship time.
[2176.36 → 2194.54] Good morning. So my name is Ken, and I'm an elder here at Emanuel, and it's good to be
[2194.54 → 2197.66] gathered together this morning. I see so many people that I haven't seen in a while,
[2197.66 → 2202.24] so it's good to see us all here this morning. And for those online, just like every other Sunday
[2202.24 → 2206.70] morning, we have the opportunity to gather together and come to our Lord in prayer. And
[2206.70 → 2211.98] as a community, we can bring our thanks to God and our concerns and our petitions to our
[2211.98 → 2215.56] Lord. And so let's gather our hearts and minds together, and let's do that right now as we
[2215.56 → 2223.60] come to God in prayer. Our Father in heaven, our Saviour Jesus, Holy Spirit, we come to you
[2223.60 → 2228.46] with our hearts lifted again to the knowledge and the wonder of the grace you work in our lives.
[2228.46 → 2234.26] Our Lord and our God, you are holy, almighty, and everlasting, the creator and sustainer of
[2234.26 → 2240.14] everything. And the reality that we can approach you as we are now is such an amazing and overwhelming
[2240.14 → 2247.12] display of grace. As we have sung your praises this morning and have been reminded again how you never
[2247.12 → 2252.92] fail to hold us fast, even when we get distracted by ourselves, our hearts are moved to overwhelming
[2252.92 → 2259.04] joy and thanksgiving for everything you do and have done for us. And we turn to you with our
[2259.04 → 2263.60] trials and burdens, knowing again that you work all things together for our salvation.
[2264.88 → 2269.22] We thank you, Lord, for the opportunity we have to gather together as a congregational family,
[2269.54 → 2274.72] both here in person and online. We thank you for this body of believers who care for each other
[2274.72 → 2280.18] and support each other and work together to declare the salvation we know with our community here in
[2280.18 → 2284.84] Langley and the extended communities that we are part of through each member of Emmanuel.
[2285.88 → 2292.24] We pray that you work through us with the power to give us boldness and to help us live lives and
[2292.24 → 2298.40] speak truth of the gospel to the people we encounter day to day. Lord, we pray for all the ministries of
[2298.40 → 2303.48] our local church body and of our denomination, that you will bless these ministries and use them for
[2303.48 → 2308.80] your kingdom glory. We thank you for the heart of service and support for the ministries of Emmanuel
[2308.80 → 2314.76] that you have instilled in our congregation. We ask that you help us continue to bring our first
[2314.76 → 2321.36] fruits of our time, resources, and our hearts to you. We pray, Lord, for the leadership of Emmanuel,
[2321.94 → 2327.82] for the pastors and staff, and for the leadership of the Christian Reformed denomination. Please grant
[2327.82 → 2333.62] them all wisdom and the hearts tuned to your will to lead your church in a ministry to a world that
[2333.62 → 2339.66] often seems to be turning away from its God and creator. We also pray, Lord, for the leaders of
[2339.66 → 2345.66] our country, of our provinces, municipalities, and of our health authorities, as they have a very
[2345.66 → 2350.74] difficult task of navigating and leading through the current challenges. Grant them wisdom, Lord.
[2351.80 → 2356.58] We pray for those in our congregation who are sick with COVID at this time and with other ailments.
[2357.08 → 2362.68] We pray, Lord, that you bring physical healing and let each person feel your nearness and presence,
[2362.68 → 2367.72] especially for those who need to isolate or maintain distance from loved ones.
[2369.44 → 2373.54] Lord, we have a number of congregation members, too, who have recently lost loved ones.
[2374.12 → 2379.10] We grieve together with them, Father, and we think of especially Jeff and Marine Muller and Rick and
[2379.10 → 2383.88] Sam Holders' families with the passing of Jeff's dad and Sam's brother-in-law, George Muller.
[2384.64 → 2389.12] And be especially near to Rick and Sam Holders, as shortly after George Muller passed,
[2389.12 → 2394.54] Rick's sister Barb also passed away. Have an extra measure of grace on their lives, Lord.
[2395.48 → 2401.56] And we pray also for Bob and Louise Kiss with the passing of Louise's mom in Ontario. We pray for
[2401.56 → 2407.50] each of these people for your comfort and support to come in their lives and for your continued comfort
[2407.50 → 2413.34] for those who have lost loved ones longer ago and still grieve and miss them. We also pray,
[2413.34 → 2418.70] Father, for those who have been through difficult events recently. We pray for the flood recovery
[2418.70 → 2423.06] taking place throughout our province and in Abbotsford, that you would bless the work of
[2423.06 → 2428.82] everyone that is helping with the cleanup and repairs. Lord, please use this catastrophe. Let
[2428.82 → 2434.02] it builds your kingdom and help it unite churches together as we come together to support the efforts.
[2434.02 → 2440.66] We pray also for Kevin and Colleen Breedsfeld, Lord, nephew to Marilyn Heine, who were in a very
[2440.66 → 2447.02] serious car accident this week. Help them recover quickly and fully. We pray for those in missions.
[2447.56 → 2452.48] We lift Jared Alcoa, who's travelling to Costa Rica to Bible College in Cape and Ray for four months
[2452.48 → 2459.02] of leadership development and mission training. We pray, Father, that during this time he would grow,
[2459.02 → 2464.00] that Jared would become a disciple for you, and that you would use Jared and prepare him for the
[2464.00 → 2471.10] many ways that you will call him to use his skills and leadership that he is learning at this time.
[2472.40 → 2477.74] And we pray, Lord, for those who have loved ones who have turned away from you. We ask that you work
[2477.74 → 2484.70] in their hearts and draw them near to you again. Help us to continue to pray and to continue to hold out
[2484.70 → 2491.04] our thoughts and prayers for these people. Lord, we pray for those who are struggling with mental health
[2491.04 → 2496.64] as well, with addictions, chronic pain and illness, and so many other daily challenges.
[2497.38 → 2503.78] We ask for your healing and restoration in each of their lives. Lord, we all face trials, and we all
[2503.78 → 2507.76] have temptations that can disrupt our lives and distract us from living our lives for you.
[2508.62 → 2513.30] And we come together and ask you, Lord, to lead us away from temptation, that you would deliver us from
[2513.30 → 2519.86] the evil one who wants to snare us in his traps of deceit. Hold us to the truth that the kingdom is
[2519.86 → 2525.94] yours, all the power is yours, and all the glory is yours, God, forever and ever. We pray these things
[2525.94 → 2528.04] in the name of our Saviour Jesus. Amen.
[2528.04 → 2555.10] Good morning, everyone.
[2555.10 → 2562.76] Good morning, everyone. We are going to continue our sermon series today through the book of Exodus,
[2562.98 → 2569.14] and we're going to be looking at Exodus chapter 3 this morning, the story of Moses and the burning bush.
[2569.90 → 2573.34] So I encourage you, pull out your Bibles, your phones, whatever you've got with you, you can turn
[2573.34 → 2579.86] to that right now. And as you turn to that in your Bibles, though, we are going to look at how we got here
[2579.86 → 2586.00] in the story of Scripture. So strap yourself in, sit back, keep your arms and legs inside the sanctuary
[2586.00 → 2589.62] or your living room or wherever you're sitting, because we're going to go full throttle
[2589.62 → 2593.86] through Genesis and the first couple chapters of Exodus, and we're going to do it in 300 words, and we're going to do it
[2593.86 → 2597.78] quickly. So here we go. God created the heavens and the earth. However,
[2598.30 → 2601.44] humanity sinned and brought in brokenness to this world.
[2601.44 → 2608.58] God kicked mankind out of the garden, and they began to work, and they began to multiply, and they kept sinning.
[2608.98 → 2616.04] Generations went by, and humanity's sin grew and grew and grew, and so God flooded the world, killing everyone
[2616.04 → 2621.82] but Noah and his family. God then made a promise that he was going to save the world a different
[2621.82 → 2627.50] way, and it all started with a man named Abraham. He would become the start of a nation,
[2627.50 → 2632.96] and that nation would become great. God would be their God, and they would be his people, and from
[2632.96 → 2641.32] them the world would be saved from sin and brokenness forever. Abraham had a son Isaac. Isaac had a son
[2641.32 → 2649.84] Jacob. Jacob had 12 sons, one of whom was Joseph, and Joseph was sold by his brothers to Egypt as a slave.
[2650.04 → 2655.74] He went through a whole ton of stuff in Egypt and ended up actually saving them from a giant famine years
[2655.74 → 2664.14] later. Joseph's extended family of 70 fled to Egypt to escape this famine, reunited with Joseph, and settled
[2664.14 → 2671.70] down. And then over 400 years, this family of 70 people grew to a number so large that the Pharaoh,
[2671.90 → 2680.02] the Egyptian Pharaoh got nervous, so nervous that he issued a decree telling the Egyptian soldiers to kill
[2680.02 → 2686.10] all the Israelite boys and drown them in the river. But as we heard last week in the first chapter of
[2686.10 → 2692.84] Exodus, Moses was spared from this. He was put inside a basket and floated down the river where Pharaoh's
[2692.84 → 2700.74] daughter found him and raised him in the palace. Then in Exodus chapter 2, when Moses was about 40 years old,
[2700.80 → 2706.78] he witnesses an Egyptian man beating an Israelite, and when he thought no one was looking, he murdered
[2706.78 → 2712.80] this Egyptian man and hid the body. But soon he was called out by an Israelite for doing so.
[2713.18 → 2720.20] This terrified Moses, and he fled into the wilderness, running away from Egypt. He met a man there named Jethro.
[2720.36 → 2726.88] He married one of his daughters. He had a son, and he started to live his life as a shepherd, which he did that
[2726.88 → 2732.74] for 40 years as well. And then we get to our text today. You all still with me?
[2732.74 → 2740.22] Perfect. Okay, so Exodus 3, verses 1 to 14. We read this.
[2741.42 → 2747.08] Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Median, and he led the
[2747.08 → 2753.76] flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. There the angel of the
[2753.76 → 2760.66] Lord appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that the bush was on fire,
[2760.66 → 2766.02] but it did not burn up. So Moses thought, I will go over and see this strange sight, why the bush does
[2766.02 → 2771.36] not burn up. When the Lord saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush,
[2771.56 → 2779.10] Moses, Moses. And Moses said, here I am. Do not come any closer, God said. Take off your sandals,
[2779.34 → 2784.62] for the place where you are standing is holy ground. Then he said, I am the God of your father,
[2784.62 → 2792.32] the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. At this, Moses hid his face because he was
[2792.32 → 2799.88] afraid to look at God. The Lord said, I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard
[2799.88 → 2806.30] them crying out because of their slave drivers, and I am concerned about their suffering. So I have come
[2806.30 → 2812.56] down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of the land into good and
[2812.56 → 2818.44] spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey, the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Ammonites,
[2818.66 → 2824.06] Perizzites, Divides, and Websites. And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me, and I have seen the
[2824.06 → 2832.30] way the Egyptians are oppressing them. So now go, I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people,
[2832.38 → 2839.30] the Israelites, out of Egypt. But Moses said to God, who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring
[2839.30 → 2846.36] the Israelites out of Egypt? And God said, I will be with you. And this will be a sign to you that it
[2846.36 → 2851.26] is who I have sent you, that is I who has sent you. When you have brought the people out of Egypt,
[2851.64 → 2858.46] you will worship God at this mountain. Moses said to God, suppose I go to the Israelites and say to him,
[2858.82 → 2864.52] the God of your fathers, your fathers have sent me to you. And they asked me, what is his name?
[2864.52 → 2873.72] Then what shall I tell them? God said, I am who I am. This is what you are to say to the Israelites.
[2874.42 → 2879.24] I am has sent me to you. The word of the Lord.
[2883.64 → 2892.26] Moses encounters God. He sees a burning bush. And he notices that it isn't burning up, and so he
[2892.26 → 2899.80] investigates. And as he's looking at this weird sight, God himself speaks from the bush to Moses.
[2900.80 → 2907.90] That's a cool story. It's a huge moment, too, in the grand narrative of God's redemption plan in
[2907.90 → 2916.10] scripture. And it's also a story that teaches us that when we encounter God, we are called to action.
[2917.72 → 2922.06] Now let's look at this encounter. Moses checks out the burning bush, and then God speaks to him. God
[2922.06 → 2928.44] tells him to take off his sandals, and then in verse 6, God introduces himself, which is a really nice
[2928.44 → 2933.98] thing to do when you're meeting someone in person for the first time. So God says, I am the God of your
[2933.98 → 2941.46] father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And then at the end of our text, too,
[2941.50 → 2948.84] when Moses asks, who should I tell them sent me? God responds similarly, and he says, I am who I am.
[2948.84 → 2964.36] Tell them I am has sent me to you. I am. I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Furthermore, I am who I am. That's how God
[2964.36 → 2974.96] introduces himself to Moses. Not I was. See that? Not I was the God of Abraham, because Abraham is long gone
[2974.96 → 2988.98] at this point. But God isn't. I am the God of Abraham. I am who I am. God is constant. He is unchanging. His character is true.
[2989.30 → 2997.42] His promises are certain. He is and was and is to come. And no matter where you are in that, whether it is now,
[2997.42 → 3007.08] or was, or will be, it is always I am with God. God always is. Him saying I am is not actually some
[3007.08 → 3014.38] sort of code that we need to dig into, though we definitely could. God is God. Always. Never swerving,
[3014.50 → 3022.26] never changing. In this day, in days past, in days future, God always is. And our language kind of fails
[3022.26 → 3028.52] fails us here. And our minds can't fully comprehend that God existed before time began,
[3028.52 → 3036.98] and he will exist when time ends. And he continues to exist both inside and outside of time as we know it.
[3038.52 → 3045.50] He has always been. He always will be. There is nothing more constant, more present, more consistent
[3045.50 → 3056.56] than God. I am who I am. And what's more from this introduction is that by introducing himself as the God of Moses'
[3056.82 → 3065.82] fathers, of Abraham, of Isaac, of Jacob, God is reminding Moses of the covenant promises he made to Abraham
[3065.82 → 3073.72] and his descendants. God says, I am Abraham's God, the God of your fathers. I am the God of the covenant promises
[3073.72 → 3081.00] I made, the promise where you will be my people and I will be your God. This has been true and is still true.
[3081.88 → 3087.90] And this will always be true. That was the covenant God made with his people. And Moses and the Israelites,
[3088.66 → 3095.78] by this introduction, were being invited into this promise. I am who I am.
[3095.78 → 3105.22] Moses encountered God, and then God called him into action. Verse 10, God says to Moses,
[3105.46 → 3110.98] I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people, the Israelites, out of Egypt.
[3112.96 → 3120.16] When we encounter God, we are called into action. But Moses didn't love that idea, though. He didn't
[3120.16 → 3123.94] love that idea. So throughout chapter 3 and then into chapter 4, which we didn't even read,
[3123.94 → 3130.10] he comes up with a bunch of excuses about why he shouldn't go, why he shouldn't listen to this
[3130.10 → 3138.82] call to action. Just listen to some of them. He says, who am I? What shall I say? What if they doubt me?
[3140.10 → 3146.00] I can't speak in front of people. Finally, he actually just says to God, no, send someone else.
[3146.00 → 3153.92] A long time ago, many moons ago, I heard a teaching on this text where the teacher commented that he
[3153.92 → 3159.88] found it so strange and so ridiculous that Moses, after seeing and hearing the voice of God,
[3160.94 → 3165.88] would come up with all these excuses to not do what God says. And maybe you sit here, maybe you agree
[3165.88 → 3170.12] with that. I mean, I kind of did. I mean, God has literally just introduced himself to Moses,
[3170.12 → 3175.72] Moses. And Moses instantly starts saying, nah, no, no, I'm gonna, I'm not going to do that. Like,
[3175.74 → 3183.62] how can he do that? God was just speaking to him. Like, just listen, man. But we're all guilty of this,
[3183.66 → 3190.76] aren't we? I mean, sure, God hasn't spoken to us through a burning bush, per se, at least not that
[3190.76 → 3199.26] I've heard of here in this church. But he does encounter us all the time. We hear his voice for
[3199.26 → 3210.62] sure every week. And I pray and hope every day. We have God's word. We have, we have access to God's
[3210.62 → 3217.38] voice whenever we crack the cover of this book, whenever we flip through its pages. We hear God's
[3217.38 → 3224.88] voice every time we read its words. We have the ability to sit down and listen and wait in God's
[3224.88 → 3233.54] presence anytime we wish to. God's word, the Bible, this is his way of encountering his people. And
[3233.54 → 3239.18] it's not the only way either, of course. God uses all sorts of means to speak to us, to speak to his
[3239.18 → 3245.60] people. Dreams and visions still happen to some. We hear, we hear podcasts we'll listen to. We watch
[3245.60 → 3252.26] pastors online. We read devotionals. God uses other people to speak his words into our lives as well,
[3252.54 → 3258.64] be them pastors or elders, friends, teachers, parents, siblings, colleagues, strangers even.
[3259.56 → 3266.56] But when God speaks to us, when God speaks to us, whether it's through a podcast or through a person,
[3267.26 → 3274.88] it is only from God if it is rooted here, in this book, in his word. This is where we encounter God.
[3274.88 → 3280.58] Whether we're reading it to ourselves, whether we're testing what other people say to us,
[3280.58 → 3288.78] or whether we're hearing it in church or online, wherever we may be. This is God's voice for those
[3288.78 → 3296.24] who believe. And so when God encounters us here, when God's word calls us into action,
[3296.24 → 3309.82] what do we do? Do we make excuses like Moses? When the Bible teaches us to lead or to love or to pray or to
[3309.82 → 3316.32] declare his name or to live into the lives of those around us or to serve his body,
[3316.32 → 3325.50] what do we say? I'm not spiritual enough to do that. I wouldn't know what to say to them right now.
[3326.02 → 3330.36] That's too awkward. I can't do that here. I'm not perfect at public speaking. Furthermore, I'm not going to
[3330.36 → 3337.12] do that in front of church. You know what? God just sent someone else. They're the same excuses.
[3337.12 → 3344.88] They're the same excuses as Moses. We make the same ones. God's voice might not come out of a bush to us,
[3344.88 → 3352.48] but it may as well be just as clear to us because God's word calls us to action.
[3352.48 → 3363.96] When he calls us to action, do we listen or do we make excuses? When he calls you to action,
[3364.80 → 3368.02] do you listen or make excuses?
[3371.32 → 3377.84] Now, God's response to Moses' excuses are awesome, though, and we'll look at them right now. So
[3377.84 → 3381.82] throughout chapter 3 and into chapter 4, and I encourage you later today or this week,
[3381.82 → 3387.56] please pick up your Bibles. Read chapter 4. It's a good one, too. It's further conversation
[3387.56 → 3392.80] between God and Moses here. But God promises two things that will combat Moses' excuses.
[3393.94 → 3398.98] First, in verse 12 of our text, which we read today, God promises him that he will go with Moses.
[3399.84 → 3406.64] Moses doesn't need to worry about his status, his qualifications, his nature, or anything like
[3406.64 → 3414.76] that because no matter what, God was going to be with him. Now, this plays out in all the ways
[3414.76 → 3420.20] that God—this plays out in all sorts of ways as God walks alongside of Moses and his people throughout
[3420.20 → 3425.00] the rest of this book. And we'll no doubt get to a bunch of these texts and passages later,
[3425.06 → 3430.50] but I'll give you a little bit of a teaser. God goes with them. He guides them, his people, as a cloud
[3430.50 → 3436.52] of smoke. He protects them as a pillar of fire. Furthermore, he provides for them in the desert, in the wilderness
[3436.52 → 3442.78] with manna and with water. He grants them status as a nation and gives them victories over the evil
[3442.78 → 3451.92] nations around them. Over and over and over, God is with his people. And that is still true today.
[3451.92 → 3458.92] No matter what you are facing in this world today, no matter what the opposition, no matter what the
[3458.92 → 3465.78] grief, no matter what the struggles, no matter what the anxieties, no matter what is going on in your
[3465.78 → 3479.08] life right now, God is with you. And God is calling you. He will be with you. Do not be afraid. He will be
[3479.08 → 3486.58] with you. God's covenant promise that he will be our God, and we will be his people was true with Abraham,
[3486.88 → 3495.46] was true with Moses, and it's true today. God has always kept up that end of the promise. Always. The
[3495.46 → 3502.56] Holy Spirit has come down to guide and protect you. God, our Father, provides for us in ways that we may not
[3502.56 → 3509.74] even notice or care to acknowledge our status, our identities, they are rooted in God's covenant
[3509.74 → 3516.46] promises to us. And we are called now children of God. We are called heirs of the throne through Jesus
[3516.46 → 3524.80] Christ. And we are born again out of this world. God is with us no matter where we are, no matter how we
[3524.80 → 3533.10] feel, no matter what obstacles we are up against. So no matter what excuse we give for not following,
[3533.82 → 3541.04] God is still with us. But there was something else God provided Moses in the midst of all these excuses.
[3541.20 → 3547.60] Actually, it was someone else. In Exodus 4 verses 14 through 16, after Moses tells God that he's not
[3547.60 → 3554.02] really a good public speaker, he can't do this job, God sends Moses' own brother Aaron, saying he'll be with
[3554.02 → 3562.94] you two. He's a good speaker. You can do this together. God gave Moses a community to do this
[3562.94 → 3571.58] job. God's given us this gift too. We have the church. We have each other. You may think that you
[3571.58 → 3576.38] don't have what it takes to do whatever action God is placing on your heart right now. You may think
[3576.38 → 3582.06] that you don't have what it takes to do whatever it is God is calling you to do. But you have me,
[3582.06 → 3588.74] and you have Pastor Chris, and you have Daryl, and you have John, you've got Ken, you've got other John.
[3589.16 → 3593.66] We've got each other. Like, look around right now. Actually, just do it. Look around right now. Look
[3593.66 → 3599.18] across this room online. Flip through the directory. Look beside you. Look behind you. This is who God
[3599.18 → 3607.10] has given you to do the job that he is calling you to do. He has given us each other so that we can help
[3607.10 → 3613.42] each other, that we can support one another to do what it is God calls us to do. We may have excuses
[3613.42 → 3621.40] for not wanting to follow God's plan, but we can help each other. While we can look at this passage,
[3621.50 → 3626.22] and we can be told that we're like Moses because we make excuses for what we're called to do, maybe
[3626.22 → 3633.20] some of us today need to hear that we actually need to be more like Aaron. We need to be there for
[3633.20 → 3639.58] someone. We need to help them trust a little bit more. Furthermore, we need to help them lead people a little
[3639.58 → 3645.98] bit better. You have to help them serve this community a little bit more fruitfully. Help them
[3645.98 → 3652.00] in their biggest time of doubt and need. Maybe the biggest challenge for some of us today is that we
[3652.00 → 3659.90] need to realize we are not alone in whatever it is God is calling us to do. Or maybe one of the biggest
[3659.90 → 3665.94] challenges we got today is that you are being called to be Aaron to the Mosses in your life.
[3669.20 → 3677.30] So Moses encountered God. We encounter God. Moses made excuses. We also make excuses. God promised to
[3677.30 → 3683.30] be with Moses and gave him a community to support him. And God promises to be with us and gives us a
[3683.30 → 3690.74] community to support one another. But there is more. While I said we are like Moses where we make
[3690.74 → 3696.84] excuses, and we're like Aaron where we can be there for someone, really in this story we are the Israelites.
[3698.70 → 3705.48] We are God's people, the Israelites, but we need saving from captivity. God's people, the Israelites,
[3705.60 → 3710.58] they were held captive in Egypt. They needed saving from them, but we also need saving from
[3710.58 → 3715.14] captivity. That was the whole point of this passage, really. God was coming down to save his people.
[3715.74 → 3720.74] Verse 8 says, I have come down to rescue them from the hands of the Egyptians and to bring them out of
[3720.74 → 3727.86] the land and into a good and spacious land. Coming out of this Christmas season, though, I think the
[3727.86 → 3736.06] parallel has been a little bit more obvious than normal. That's what God did for us, too. Jesus came down
[3736.06 → 3744.40] from heaven. He made himself of no reputation. He became human in order to save all of us, all of us
[3744.40 → 3753.36] from our captivity. Jesus came to live this perfect life that none of us have lived up to living. And then
[3753.36 → 3759.18] he died a very brutal and very cruel death that we all deserved, and he did that in our place.
[3759.18 → 3766.56] And he did that in order to wear the sin and the brokenness that burdens us all and to bring it with
[3766.56 → 3773.96] him to die. It doesn't end there, because on the third day, Jesus rose again from the dead, leaving sin
[3773.96 → 3782.80] and brokenness behind, and he did all of that in order to free us from the captivity of sin and brokenness
[3782.80 → 3789.60] in this world. We are held captive to sin and brokenness, aren't we? We're captive to fear.
[3790.28 → 3799.20] We're captive to pain. We're captive to addiction. We're captive to worry or frustration or anxiety
[3799.20 → 3805.24] or grief. We are captive to so many things that hinder us from living.
[3805.24 → 3815.72] But God came down to free us from that captivity. Jesus lived and died and rose again to ultimately free us
[3815.72 → 3823.04] from the burden of sin and brokenness. Now, you will find that you will still worry.
[3823.98 → 3829.88] You may still be anxious. You may still battle addiction. A lot of us are grieving.
[3829.88 → 3844.54] A lot of us struggle with sin and brokenness, but those things are not who you are anymore because of
[3844.54 → 3850.82] the power of Jesus Christ. You, we, all of us have been made new. So while we may struggle with the sin
[3850.82 → 3859.50] and brokenness in this world, it does not define you anymore because you are defined by Christ's love,
[3859.50 → 3868.46] grace, and mercy. Jesus defines who we are. His mercy for us, his grace for us, his love for us.
[3869.88 → 3879.98] And that is why when Jesus encounters you and encounters us, and when we are called into action,
[3881.12 → 3889.06] things like fear and worry and addiction aren't excuses anymore. While we still battle them,
[3889.50 → 3899.34] they don't stand in our way. We have all been made right by God through Jesus Christ. Amen?
[3900.38 → 3905.92] Sermon's not done. Back to the story of the burning bush, though. I just thought that that was a good
[3905.92 → 3910.94] amen part. I think we needed that rooted into our hearts there. So Moses makes excuses,
[3910.94 → 3918.04] excuses. But after his encounter with God, he does obey. In fact, he becomes one of the greatest
[3918.04 → 3923.94] examples of faith that we have in God's Word. I am going to conclude here, so I'm not going off on a
[3923.94 → 3928.48] whole new tangent here. That wasn't such a big trick. I want you, though, to lean into this. I'm
[3928.48 → 3932.78] going to conclude with this passage here. We're going to read a passage in Hebrews, and I want you to
[3932.78 → 3940.14] really listen to how the author of Hebrews here describes Moses' faithful response to God's calling
[3940.14 → 3948.32] on him and to action. So Hebrews 11 verses 24 to 27 says this, by faith, Moses, when he had grown up,
[3948.68 → 3956.34] refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh's daughter. He chose to be mistreated along with the people of
[3956.34 → 3966.10] God rather than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin. Listen to this. He regarded disgrace for the
[3966.10 → 3974.52] sake of Christ as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his reward.
[3976.18 → 3984.56] By faith, he left Egypt, not fearing the king's anger. He persevered because he saw him who is invisible.
[3986.34 → 3992.66] Hebrews says Moses knew it was better to be disgraced for the sake of Jesus Christ
[3992.66 → 3999.32] centuries before Jesus came to earth, who he only knew who Moses only knew by the name I am.
[4000.18 → 4003.88] But he knew it was better to be disgraced for the sake of Jesus Christ than anything else.
[4005.10 → 4012.94] In fact, being publicly disgraced in the name of Jesus was more valuable to Moses than all the
[4012.94 → 4017.58] treasures in Egypt, which he would have known how much value there was growing up in the palace.
[4018.96 → 4025.54] And so when God called him to action, despite the original excuses, Moses faithfully obeyed,
[4025.96 → 4034.06] and he followed God. He saw him who was invisible. He encountered God, and he listened to the call of
[4034.06 → 4041.90] action. And in spoiler alert, God went on to use Moses to save his people from the Egyptians. And stay
[4041.90 → 4046.88] tuned for the rest of the story. We'll pick all of that apart. So I leave you with this. I leave you
[4046.88 → 4056.08] this to ponder. We have been saved. Jesus has come, and he's guaranteed our glorious, eternal inheritance
[4056.08 → 4062.62] if we just put our faith in him. And now we can encounter God each and every time we open up his word.
[4062.62 → 4068.66] But an encounter with God is always a call to action.
[4070.76 → 4073.68] So what actions are being placed on your heart this morning?
[4074.92 → 4076.54] Is it an action of forgiveness?
[4077.86 → 4082.24] Is it a nudge to step out of your comfort zone and pray over someone?
[4082.84 → 4083.74] Perhaps someone's?
[4085.30 → 4088.06] Are you being called to declare the gospel
[4088.06 → 4091.42] in an environment that maybe is a little bit hesitant to hear that?
[4093.06 → 4096.90] Are you being challenged to serve in a local agency here in this community,
[4097.12 → 4098.94] to serve the least of these in our neighbourhood?
[4099.70 → 4103.78] Or perhaps being called to serve in a ministry or committee here in this church?
[4105.18 → 4108.88] Is God placing it on your heart right now to give more of your time,
[4108.88 → 4110.92] more of your money, more of your energy,
[4111.08 → 4113.78] more of your resources to his kingdom purposes,
[4114.24 → 4116.40] rather than our own life's initiatives?
[4118.06 → 4120.56] I can't answer these questions for you,
[4120.62 → 4123.90] but I do implore you to ask them of yourselves and answer them.
[4124.46 → 4126.68] Because God has promised to be with you.
[4127.46 → 4129.78] He's given you this community to support you.
[4131.40 → 4133.16] Are you prepared to take action?
[4134.78 → 4137.80] When God encounters us, whenever we open his word,
[4137.84 → 4141.38] like we did today, he calls us to action.
[4143.36 → 4144.44] So what's your move?
[4145.34 → 4146.08] Let me pray.
[4148.06 → 4154.62] Father God, we encounter you each and every time we open up this word.
[4154.62 → 4160.20] And as you encountered Moses in the burning bush and called him to action to save your people from Egypt,
[4160.34 → 4162.26] God, you call us to action.
[4162.62 → 4163.66] You call us to love.
[4164.12 → 4165.20] You call us to serve.
[4165.78 → 4166.92] You call us to give.
[4167.52 → 4169.68] Lord, you call us to all sorts of things.
[4169.78 → 4170.94] And so often, Lord,
[4171.46 → 4174.46] we either ignore it or we come up with excuses for it.
[4174.46 → 4177.22] But God, right now, I ask for your Holy Spirit.
[4177.54 → 4182.26] God, may your Spirit be present in this place to all who are listening right now.
[4182.34 → 4186.72] God, may you imprint on our hearts what it is you are calling us to do.
[4187.14 → 4190.62] What actions are you calling us to move forward with, God?
[4190.62 → 4196.42] And will you give us the courage to know that we have been made new in Christ
[4196.42 → 4202.24] and we can go forward fulfilling these callings on our life because you are with us.
[4202.98 → 4205.06] So God, whatever is on our hearts right now,
[4205.12 → 4207.72] whatever call to action you are placing in front of us,
[4208.10 → 4210.56] may we step forward faithfully,
