[0.00 --> 29.98]  Thank you.
[30.00 --> 59.98]  Thank you.
[60.00 --> 89.98]  Thank you.
[90.00 --> 92.00]  Thank you.
[92.00 --> 94.00]  Thank you.
[94.00 --> 96.00]  Thank you.
[102.00 --> 106.00]  Good evening.
[106.00 --> 108.30]  The Lord speaks from on high.
[108.30 --> 112.30]  Welcome to worship tonight.
[112.30 --> 115.84]  For those of you who are gathered here, welcome to this space.
[115.94 --> 120.30]  For those of you who are joining us online, welcome to you as well.
[120.30 --> 127.26]  We have the opportunity to worship God tonight at the end of the year and the ways to look
[127.26 --> 134.10]  back on the Lord's provision and anticipate his provision as we go forward into the next
[134.10 --> 134.60]  year.
[134.60 --> 140.72]  And so it's good for us to gather in this way to reflect theologically and prayerfully
[140.72 --> 148.08]  on the ways that we have seen God at work, especially after this past year, especially
[148.08 --> 150.00]  after this past two years.
[150.00 --> 157.98]  It's so important for us to develop the eyes and the faith that sees God at work in the
[157.98 --> 158.24]  world.
[158.48 --> 160.92]  That's what we are here to do this evening.
[161.72 --> 166.50]  I'm going to invite you, whether you're here present or at home, to just adopt a posture
[166.50 --> 167.30]  of receipt.
[167.58 --> 169.96]  God's going to welcome us into his presence tonight.
[169.96 --> 172.38]  So maybe you stand, hold your hands out.
[172.74 --> 174.52]  If you're at home, hold your hands out.
[174.64 --> 179.54]  Receive God's greeting as we come to worship him.
[182.34 --> 189.46]  Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ through the
[189.46 --> 191.86]  presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[192.66 --> 194.96]  All God's people said, amen.
[195.34 --> 196.30]  Let's worship God tonight.
[199.96 --> 211.18]  Forget the former things.
[211.76 --> 213.48]  Do not dwell on the past.
[214.22 --> 216.08]  See, I am doing a new thing.
[216.38 --> 217.28]  Now it springs up.
[217.48 --> 218.56]  Do you not perceive it?
[219.24 --> 222.82]  I am making a way in the desert and streams in the wasteland.
[223.54 --> 228.78]  The wild animals honor me, the jackals and the owls, because I provide water in the desert
[228.78 --> 236.08]  and streams in the wasteland to give drink to my people, my chosen, the people I have formed
[236.08 --> 238.78]  for myself, that they may proclaim my praise.
[238.78 --> 259.60]  Great is he who's the king of kings and the lord of lords, he is wonderful.
[259.60 --> 274.04]  Great is he who's the king of kings and the lord of lords, he is wonderful.
[274.04 --> 288.84]  Great is he who's the king of kings and the lord of lords, he is wonderful.
[288.84 --> 303.84]  Great is he who's the king of kings and the lord of lords, he is wonderful.
[303.84 --> 319.84]  Great is he who's the king of kings and the lord of lords, he is wonderful.
[319.84 --> 333.84]  Great is he who's the king of kings and the lord of lords, he is wonderful.
[333.84 --> 347.84]  Great is he who's the king of kings and the lord of lords, he is wonderful.
[347.84 --> 377.82]  Great is he who's the king of kings and the lord of lords, he is wonderful.
[377.82 --> 382.82]  Great is he who's the king of kings and the lord of lords, and the lord of lords, he is wonderful.
[382.82 --> 389.88]  Wisdom, power and love, our God is an awesome God.
[389.88 --> 400.82]  Our God is an awesome God, He reigns from heaven above with wisdom.
[400.82 --> 406.56]  Power and love, our God is an awesome God.

[423.24 --> 433.98]  Our God is an awesome God, He reigns from heaven above with wisdom.
[433.98 --> 439.44]  Power and love, our God is an awesome God.
[439.44 --> 449.90]  Our God is an awesome God, He reigns from heaven above with wisdom.
[449.90 --> 455.22]  Power and love, our God is an awesome God.
[455.22 --> 465.68]  Our God is an awesome God, He reigns from heaven above with wisdom.
[465.68 --> 471.10]  Power and love, our God is an awesome God.
[471.62 --> 477.74]  Our God is an awesome God.
[479.90 --> 498.90]  Power and love, our God is an awesome God.
[498.90 --> 505.42]  What is our hope in life and death?
[506.22 --> 509.90]  Christ alone, Christ alone.
[509.90 --> 515.10]  What is our only confidence?
[516.10 --> 520.76]  That our souls to Him belong.
[521.12 --> 526.04]  Who holds our days within His hands?
[526.04 --> 531.04]  What comes apart from His command?
[531.04 --> 536.28]  And what will keep us to the end?
[536.28 --> 542.30]  The love of Christ in which we stand?
[544.04 --> 549.18]  Oh, sing hallelujah.
[549.18 --> 554.18]  Our hope springs eternal.
[554.18 --> 555.18]  Our hope springs eternal.
[555.18 --> 559.18]  Oh, sing hallelujah.
[559.18 --> 563.18]  Now and ever we confess.
[563.18 --> 568.18]  Christ our hope in life and death.
[568.18 --> 575.18]  Christ our hope, our God is an awesome God.
[575.18 --> 580.18]  But truth can calm the troubled soul.
[580.18 --> 585.18]  God is good.
[585.18 --> 591.08]  Where is His grace and goodness stoned
[591.08 --> 596.22]  In our great Redeemer's blood
[596.22 --> 601.16]  Who holds our faith when fears arise
[601.16 --> 606.20]  Who stands above the stormy trial
[606.20 --> 611.44]  Who sends the waves that bring us high
[611.44 --> 618.44]  Unto the shore, the rock of Christ
[619.00 --> 624.22]  O sing hallelujah
[624.22 --> 629.34]  Our hope springs eternal
[629.34 --> 634.36]  O sing hallelujah
[634.36 --> 638.86]  Now and ever we confess
[638.86 --> 643.86]  Christ our hope in life and death
[643.86 --> 656.00]  Unto the grave, what will we sing?
[656.68 --> 660.86]  Christ He lives, Christ He lives
[660.86 --> 666.82]  And what reward will heaven bring?
[668.86 --> 670.86]  Everlasting life within
[670.86 --> 677.36]  There we will rise to meet the Lord
[677.36 --> 681.86]  Then sin and death will be destroyed
[681.86 --> 687.86]  And we will feast in endless joy
[687.86 --> 694.86]  When Christ is ours forever alone
[694.86 --> 700.86]  O sing hallelujah
[700.86 --> 705.86]  Our hope springs eternal
[705.86 --> 710.86]  O sing hallelujah
[710.86 --> 714.86]  Now and ever we confess
[714.86 --> 719.86]  Christ our hope in life and death
[719.86 --> 721.86]  Now and ever we confess
[721.86 --> 726.86]  Christ our hope in life and death
[726.86 --> 727.86]  Now and ever we confess

[748.86 --> 754.86]  Christ our hope in life and death
[754.86 --> 769.86]  There is salvation in no one else but you, Jesus
[769.86 --> 773.86]  For there is no other name given among men by which we are saved
[773.86 --> 776.86]  You are our hope when our world is falling apart
[776.86 --> 780.86]  You are our way when our path is all but clear
[780.86 --> 784.86]  You are our truth when lies invade our minds
[784.86 --> 787.86]  You are our life even in the face of death
[787.86 --> 789.86]  Our time is in your hands
[789.86 --> 793.86]  You are the hope that sustains us to the very end
[803.86 --> 823.86]  You are our love when our world is falling apart
[823.86 --> 830.86]  Holy, holy, holy
[830.86 --> 836.86]  Lord God Almighty
[836.86 --> 842.86]  Early in the morning
[842.86 --> 849.86]  Our song shall rise to Thee
[849.86 --> 856.86]  Holy, holy, holy

[925.46 --> 930.98]  Evermore shall be.

[938.36 --> 945.36]  Though the darkness hide thee,
[946.80 --> 952.50]  Though the eye may blind by sin,
[952.90 --> 958.36]  Thy glory may not see.
[958.36 --> 966.58]  Only thou art holy,
[967.58 --> 974.42]  There is none beside thee,
[975.10 --> 980.40]  Perfect in power,
[980.40 --> 985.72]  In love and purity.
[988.78 --> 994.76]  Holy, holy, holy
[994.76 --> 1001.76]  Lord God almighty,

[1203.30 --> 1205.48]  And your labor on what does not satisfy

[1517.50 --> 1523.34]  You struck doubt to bind me up

[1565.46 --> 1575.72]  My heart and flesh may fail
[1575.72 --> 1579.70]  The earth below gave way
[1579.70 --> 1583.68]  With my eyes, with my eyes
[1583.68 --> 1587.68]  I see the Lord
[1587.68 --> 1591.56]  Lifted high upon that day
[1591.56 --> 1595.68]  Before the Lamb that was slain
[1595.68 --> 1603.66]  And I'll know every tear was worth it all

[1631.46 --> 1638.46]  all I need
[1642.14 --> 1645.46]  Oh tonight I'm crying out
[1645.46 --> 1650.46]  Let this cup pass from me now
[1650.46 --> 1656.46]  You're still more than I need
[1656.46 --> 1663.46]  You're enough for me
[1664.46 --> 1671.46]  You're enough for me
[1673.46 --> 1677.46]  Though you slay me
[1678.46 --> 1681.46]  Yet I will praise you
[1681.46 --> 1685.46]  Though you take from me
[1685.46 --> 1689.46]  I will bless your name
[1689.46 --> 1693.46]  Though you ruin me
[1694.46 --> 1697.46]  Still I will worship
[1697.46 --> 1699.46]  Sing a song
[1699.46 --> 1701.46]  Sing a song
[1701.46 --> 1705.46]  Though you slay me
[1705.46 --> 1709.46]  To the one who's all I need
[1709.46 --> 1739.46] 
[1739.46 --> 1741.46]  All I need
[1741.46 --> 1745.46]  To the one who's all I need
[1745.46 --> 1747.46]  To the one who's all I need
[1747.46 --> 1749.46]  To the one who's all I need
[1749.46 --> 1753.46]  I will worship you
[1753.46 --> 1755.46]  To be
[1755.46 --> 1775.18]  it's traditional uh it's part of this type of service kind of at year's end to
[1775.18 --> 1782.26]  think back on the year that was in prayer together and so i'm going to lead you
[1782.26 --> 1792.18]  in the great prayer at year's end invite you to join your heart with me as we pray together
[1792.18 --> 1805.72]  one of the spiritual disciplines one of the the spiritual practices that i have
[1805.72 --> 1814.38]  adopted in my life is not just reading scripture but praying scripture praying through god's word
[1814.38 --> 1821.48]  as he reveals himself to us in part because i really believe that the the spirit intercedes with
[1821.48 --> 1828.30]  groans and utterances and literal words revealed on the page that we might pray to god but also
[1828.30 --> 1835.98]  because god's revealed word is just that it is his holy and perfect word and so what better way
[1835.98 --> 1841.54]  to pray than with the words that god himself has given us and so the prayer that i have shaped here
[1841.54 --> 1846.76]  and the time that we'll spend is crafted around scripture verses and so you will hear that
[1846.76 --> 1854.14]  throughout and i trust that it will impress upon your heart as we pray together let's pray
[1854.14 --> 1865.02]  abba father
[1865.02 --> 1878.14]  on this night together we cry out to you on this night together we cry hallowed be your name
[1878.14 --> 1888.76]  your kingdom come on earth as it is in heaven as we reflect on this year past lord god we know that
[1888.76 --> 1895.02]  a thousand years in your sight are like a day that has just gone by or like a watch in the night that
[1895.02 --> 1903.80]  is we know that they might pass quickly what is a day or a year compared to the infinity of eternity
[1903.80 --> 1909.80]  in which you reside and yet we also know that we also know that we know that we know that we know that
[1909.80 --> 1916.92]  with the lord a day is like a thousand years and a thousand years are like a day and the reality
[1916.92 --> 1926.36]  of time passing and our experience of time passing are not yours nor are they always the same
[1926.36 --> 1939.74]  and at times seasons rush by circumstances are fleeting and at other times days drag on and years
[1939.74 --> 1943.80]  seem to take a lifetime to endure
[1943.80 --> 1954.20]  for many of us lord this past year was just such a year
[1954.20 --> 1963.80]  covid 19 pandemic continues to be present with us and in reality present with us each in different and
[1963.80 --> 1972.88]  unique ways some have lost jobs and started new ones some are still looking some have experienced job
[1972.88 --> 1979.34]  changes in the midst of this and are and are prospering schools have been impacted and therefore kids have been
[1979.34 --> 1989.98]  impacted church and our community and life together has been impacted sports clubs hobbies so much of our life has been
[1989.98 --> 1995.28]  impacted by this pandemic over these last coming on two years now
[1995.28 --> 2003.54]  now add to all of that anxiety that's already in the mix this year we had record-breaking heat
[2003.54 --> 2010.54]  and now we have record-breaking cold creation is groaning under the weight of sin
[2010.54 --> 2014.60]  wildfires destroyed whole towns
[2014.60 --> 2020.54]  whole businesses were consumed in the flames
[2020.54 --> 2029.82]  floods then washed away roads and drowned out houses and businesses farms destroyed produce and animals lost
[2029.82 --> 2041.44]  in this world you will have trouble jesus says lord we are in trouble this was a year
[2041.44 --> 2043.02]  trouble
[2043.02 --> 2049.78]  but take heart i have overcome the world jesus continues
[2049.78 --> 2053.92]  you will hear of wars and and rumors of wars
[2053.92 --> 2059.74]  but see to it that you are not alarmed such things must happen but the end is still to come
[2059.74 --> 2064.62]  nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom there will be famines and earthquakes in
[2064.62 --> 2069.00]  various places and all these things are the beginning of birth pains
[2069.00 --> 2075.22]  then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death and you will be hated by all nations
[2075.22 --> 2081.74]  because of me says jesus and at that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other
[2081.74 --> 2086.00]  keep us faithful lord god
[2086.00 --> 2092.58]  keep us loving each other loving our neighbors
[2092.58 --> 2098.62]  we so easily divide and separate we are so easily
[2098.62 --> 2108.94]  polarized one camp to another left to right progressive conservative we are so easily split and we so easily split
[2108.94 --> 2111.82]  help us we pray
[2111.82 --> 2112.20]  we pray
[2112.20 --> 2118.82]  be united as a family of god to be united as the church of christ
[2118.82 --> 2124.42]  the one who stands firm to the end
[2124.42 --> 2125.84]  will be saved
[2125.84 --> 2131.92]  and this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations
[2131.92 --> 2138.52]  and then the end will come come quickly lord jesus come quickly
[2138.52 --> 2158.92]  and as we cry out here and now for your kingdom to come in fullness we cry out also for your kingdom to come more and more in our hearts and minds help us today and every day to take captive every thought and make it obedient to christ
[2158.92 --> 2162.36]  our lord
[2162.36 --> 2163.94]  and our god
[2163.94 --> 2167.84]  we mourn with those
[2167.84 --> 2169.12]  who mourn
[2169.12 --> 2172.20]  and we rejoice with those
[2172.20 --> 2173.24]  who rejoice
[2173.24 --> 2176.52]  looking back on the year that was
[2176.52 --> 2178.84]  even in light of everything that
[2178.84 --> 2181.92]  has happened we have reasons for both mourning
[2181.92 --> 2183.30]  and even
[2183.30 --> 2185.04]  for rejoicing
[2188.92 --> 2191.16]  father god many of us
[2191.16 --> 2193.40]  all of us
[2193.40 --> 2195.72]  this year
[2195.72 --> 2197.94]  mourned a loss
[2197.94 --> 2200.30]  we mourned
[2200.30 --> 2201.16]  sons
[2201.16 --> 2202.90]  and daughters
[2202.90 --> 2206.10]  we mourned moms and dads
[2206.10 --> 2207.02]  brothers and sisters
[2207.02 --> 2207.68]  grandparents
[2207.68 --> 2209.04]  and friends
[2209.04 --> 2212.92]  we mourned those who died
[2212.92 --> 2215.22]  too soon and who were taken from us
[2215.22 --> 2216.18]  too quickly
[2216.18 --> 2225.12]  we mourned those who were once part of our church family and those who are loved by members of our church family
[2225.12 --> 2228.92]  in our mourning
[2228.92 --> 2232.10]  we celebrated the life of peter boat
[2232.10 --> 2234.16]  and of willie miles
[2234.16 --> 2238.26]  in our mourning we surrounded
[2238.26 --> 2242.86]  family and friends with encouragement
[2242.86 --> 2244.20]  and prayers
[2244.20 --> 2247.20]  we lift them up
[2247.20 --> 2248.28]  to you now
[2248.28 --> 2256.80]  father god not only have we lost loved ones and members to
[2256.80 --> 2258.26]  to death but we have
[2258.26 --> 2267.04]  seen members transfer out of our church family into other church families and so we pray for them and we pray that they would be blessed in their new
[2267.04 --> 2267.98]  church homes
[2267.98 --> 2275.10]  we pray lord god that if they haven't yet found a new church home that they would find one quickly that fills them up with your
[2275.10 --> 2275.98]  presence
[2275.98 --> 2286.70]  bless them and keep them and continue to draw them closer to you whoever they may be wherever they are going lord god find them and hold
[2286.70 --> 2287.58]  fast
[2287.58 --> 2288.72]  to them
[2288.72 --> 2297.48]  we pray that for those relationships in our midst that we are mourning the brokenness of
[2297.48 --> 2303.08]  we pray that you would restore brother to brother and sister to sister brother to sister that you would
[2303.08 --> 2306.12]  restore us each as sons and daughters
[2306.12 --> 2313.62]  of christ that the the reconciliation that we have experienced from you in the cross of jesus would spur us
[2313.62 --> 2316.56]  forward in being reconciled to each other
[2316.56 --> 2323.60]  restore us to the joy of your salvation restore us to the joy of the fellowship of the saints
[2323.60 --> 2330.32]  father we pray that you would turn our mourning
[2330.32 --> 2332.16]  into dancing
[2332.16 --> 2336.16]  even as we mourn there are reasons to
[2336.16 --> 2337.22]  celebrate
[2337.22 --> 2341.96]  we look back on the year that was in our church and we welcomed new members

[2517.24 --> 2547.24] 
[2547.24 --> 2577.24] 
[2577.24 --> 2607.24] 
[2607.24 --> 2637.24]

[2706.86 --> 2708.46]  throughout and so encourage you to
[2708.46 --> 2712.54]  have that in front of you it will be on the screen as we read it the first time through but
[2712.54 --> 2713.80]  as we go back
[2713.80 --> 2714.60]  uh...
[2714.60 --> 2715.48]  to it throughout
[2715.48 --> 2717.40]  it'll be nice to have that
[2717.40 --> 2718.54]  there
[2718.54 --> 2723.86]  i'm going to read uh...
[2723.86 --> 2724.30]  the first
[2724.30 --> 2725.30]  uh...
[2725.30 --> 2726.44]  five ish
[2726.44 --> 2726.84]  verses
[2726.84 --> 2728.78]  of isaiah 43
[2731.58 --> 2736.18]  but now this is what the lord says
[2736.18 --> 2744.84]  he who created you jacob who formed you israel do not fear for i have redeemed you
[2744.84 --> 2749.02]  i have summoned you by name you are mine
[2749.02 --> 2753.46]  when you pass through the waters i will be with you
[2753.46 --> 2757.50]  when you pass through the rivers they will not sweep over you
[2757.50 --> 2763.74]  when you walk through the fire you will not be burned the flames will not set you
[2763.74 --> 2769.50]  ablaze for i am the lord your god the holy one of israel your savior
[2769.50 --> 2772.54]  i give egypt for your ransom
[2772.54 --> 2774.86]  bush and seba in your stead
[2774.86 --> 2780.92]  since you are precious and honored in my sight and because i love you
[2780.92 --> 2784.54]  i will give a people in exchange for you
[2784.54 --> 2787.54]  nations in exchange for your life
[2787.54 --> 2789.90]  do not be afraid
[2789.90 --> 2792.02]  for i am
[2792.02 --> 2793.26]  with you
[2793.26 --> 2795.16]  this is the word of the lord
[2795.16 --> 2803.70]  there's um
[2803.70 --> 2806.58]  a poem
[2806.58 --> 2811.46]  that from nineteen or from nineteen from seventeen eighty six
[2811.46 --> 2813.84]  by robert burns
[2813.84 --> 2816.40]  uh... called to a mouse
[2816.40 --> 2819.06]  now chances are you're not familiar with that poem
[2819.06 --> 2821.80]  but you are familiar with this line
[2821.80 --> 2825.06]  the best laid schemes of mice
[2825.06 --> 2826.18]  and men
[2826.18 --> 2828.04]  go often askew
[2828.04 --> 2831.74]  and leave nothing but grief and pain
[2831.74 --> 2833.28]  for promised joy
[2833.28 --> 2837.76]  as i prepared for this message and i reflected on
[2837.76 --> 2838.50]  2021
[2838.50 --> 2841.52]  this verse kept ringing through my head
[2841.52 --> 2845.44]  because 2021 was supposed to be the year that was better
[2845.44 --> 2848.36]  do you remember when 2020 ended
[2848.36 --> 2852.38]  and everyone was finally like finally we can be done with that
[2852.38 --> 2854.90]  2021 is going to be
[2854.90 --> 2856.24]  so much better
[2856.24 --> 2860.00]  the best laid schemes of mice
[2860.00 --> 2861.30]  and men
[2861.30 --> 2864.40]  because in the end it seems to be at least
[2864.40 --> 2864.56]  that
[2864.56 --> 2867.24]  2021 only got worse
[2867.24 --> 2869.02]  and we had heat domes
[2869.02 --> 2870.18]  and wildfires
[2870.18 --> 2870.92]  we had floods
[2870.92 --> 2872.08]  and landslides
[2872.08 --> 2874.12]  we had deaths due to this heat
[2874.12 --> 2875.84]  and then in this past week we've had
[2875.84 --> 2877.74]  deaths due to the cold
[2877.74 --> 2879.86]  and then through it all
[2879.86 --> 2881.46]  i don't have to tell you this
[2881.46 --> 2883.56]  as you sit here
[2883.56 --> 2884.20]  masked
[2884.20 --> 2885.18]  for worship
[2885.18 --> 2887.30]  we've had the constant companion
[2887.30 --> 2888.90]  of covid-19
[2888.90 --> 2893.46]  inflation
[2893.46 --> 2895.38]  has skyrocketed
[2895.38 --> 2896.76]  cost of living
[2896.76 --> 2897.74]  has gone up
[2897.74 --> 2899.40]  housing is still crazy
[2899.40 --> 2901.52]  supply chain issues
[2901.52 --> 2902.28]  have caused delay
[2902.28 --> 2902.96]  after delay
[2902.96 --> 2903.74]  after delay
[2903.74 --> 2904.28]  right
[2904.28 --> 2905.82]  some of us have been working from home
[2905.82 --> 2906.88]  and then back in the office
[2906.88 --> 2908.26]  but oh back to home again
[2908.26 --> 2910.24]  right
[2910.24 --> 2911.00]  and some of us
[2911.00 --> 2912.32]  have been told
[2912.32 --> 2912.78]  you know what
[2912.78 --> 2913.62]  working from home
[2913.62 --> 2914.86]  is saving us a lot of money
[2914.86 --> 2916.74]  so now we're not going to pay rent
[2916.74 --> 2917.88]  so we're not going to lease a building
[2917.88 --> 2919.36]  you can just stay there
[2919.36 --> 2921.74]  but if you do want to lease a building
[2921.74 --> 2922.62]  just so you know
[2922.62 --> 2923.82]  rates have gone up
[2923.82 --> 2926.14]  now of course
[2926.14 --> 2927.48]  there's been good things
[2927.48 --> 2928.88]  in the midst of all this
[2928.88 --> 2929.68]  great things
[2929.68 --> 2930.24]  even
[2930.24 --> 2930.80]  right
[2930.80 --> 2931.72]  babies have been born
[2931.72 --> 2932.44]  weddings had
[2932.44 --> 2933.60]  anniversaries celebrated
[2933.60 --> 2934.48]  graduations
[2934.48 --> 2935.26]  promotions
[2935.26 --> 2936.20]  new jobs
[2936.20 --> 2937.24]  new love
[2937.24 --> 2937.68]  right
[2937.68 --> 2940.36]  and as we look back
[2940.36 --> 2942.90]  as we take stock
[2942.90 --> 2944.74]  and I think naturally
[2944.74 --> 2945.50]  we do this
[2945.50 --> 2946.82]  we start to dream
[2946.82 --> 2948.06]  and we start to hope
[2948.06 --> 2949.32]  and we start to express
[2949.32 --> 2950.80]  what we want to see
[2950.80 --> 2951.46]  changed
[2951.46 --> 2952.36]  or want to do
[2952.36 --> 2953.24]  differently
[2953.24 --> 2955.96]  and so
[2955.96 --> 2958.80]  whether you are stuck
[2958.80 --> 2959.96]  looking back
[2959.96 --> 2961.44]  on a terrible
[2961.44 --> 2962.66]  and trying
[2962.66 --> 2963.20]  here
[2963.20 --> 2964.68]  or you are
[2964.68 --> 2965.46]  expectantly
[2965.46 --> 2966.86]  looking forward
[2966.86 --> 2967.50]  tonight
[2967.50 --> 2969.20]  is a good night
[2969.20 --> 2970.64]  to ground
[2970.64 --> 2971.48]  ourselves
[2971.48 --> 2972.92]  in the God
[2972.92 --> 2974.10]  who guides it
[2974.10 --> 2974.86]  all
[2974.86 --> 2976.80]  that's what
[2976.80 --> 2977.74]  Isaiah 43
[2977.74 --> 2978.96]  is going to do
[2978.96 --> 2979.52]  for us
[2979.52 --> 2980.22]  tonight
[2980.22 --> 2983.18]  verse 2
[2983.18 --> 2984.54]  is
[2984.54 --> 2985.96]  our key
[2985.96 --> 2987.66]  here is
[2987.66 --> 2988.36]  our theme
[2988.36 --> 2991.00]  God's presence
[2991.00 --> 2991.76]  which will be
[2991.76 --> 2992.36]  our first point
[2992.36 --> 2993.24]  God's presence
[2993.24 --> 2994.40]  means that you
[2994.40 --> 2995.08]  will not be
[2995.08 --> 2995.54]  overcome
[2995.54 --> 2997.50]  and that you
[2997.50 --> 2998.18]  will never
[2998.18 --> 2999.42]  be forsaken
[2999.42 --> 3001.24]  God's presence
[3001.24 --> 3001.84]  means you will
[3001.84 --> 3002.44]  not be overcome
[3002.44 --> 3003.06]  and you will
[3003.06 --> 3003.64]  never be
[3003.64 --> 3004.52]  forsaken
[3004.52 --> 3005.52]  first
[3005.52 --> 3006.88]  before we
[3006.88 --> 3007.74]  get into that
[3007.74 --> 3008.48]  I want to
[3008.48 --> 3009.38]  show you
[3009.38 --> 3009.72]  something
[3009.72 --> 3010.38]  important
[3010.38 --> 3011.78]  for genuine
[3011.78 --> 3012.36]  Christian
[3012.36 --> 3012.96]  living
[3012.96 --> 3013.30]  I said
[3013.30 --> 3013.72]  verse 2
[3013.72 --> 3014.24]  was our theme
[3014.24 --> 3014.62]  so look
[3014.62 --> 3015.16]  close here
[3015.16 --> 3016.60]  when you
[3016.60 --> 3017.16]  pass through
[3017.16 --> 3017.74]  the waters
[3017.74 --> 3019.28]  when you
[3019.28 --> 3019.88]  pass through
[3019.88 --> 3020.34]  the rivers
[3020.34 --> 3021.68]  when you
[3021.68 --> 3022.16]  walk through
[3022.16 --> 3022.66]  the fire
[3022.66 --> 3024.40]  did you
[3024.40 --> 3024.80]  hear that
[3024.80 --> 3026.98]  when
[3026.98 --> 3030.04]  when
[3030.04 --> 3031.88]  the presumption
[3031.88 --> 3032.88]  of Isaiah
[3032.88 --> 3034.12]  is when
[3034.12 --> 3035.22]  not if
[3035.22 --> 3037.04]  you will
[3037.04 --> 3038.28]  face crisis
[3038.28 --> 3039.20]  existential
[3039.20 --> 3040.36]  or otherwise
[3040.36 --> 3041.18]  you will
[3041.18 --> 3042.48]  be disillusioned
[3042.48 --> 3043.06]  you will
[3043.06 --> 3043.66]  know pain
[3043.66 --> 3044.04]  and you will
[3044.04 --> 3044.50]  know hardship
[3044.50 --> 3044.96]  and you will
[3044.96 --> 3045.42]  know mourning
[3045.42 --> 3045.90]  and you will
[3045.90 --> 3046.46]  know death
[3046.46 --> 3047.50]  make no mistake
[3047.50 --> 3048.02]  about it
[3048.02 --> 3048.72]  Christians
[3048.72 --> 3049.34]  and just
[3049.34 --> 3049.96]  because you
[3049.96 --> 3050.46]  are a
[3050.46 --> 3050.90]  Christian
[3050.90 --> 3052.40]  doesn't mean
[3052.40 --> 3052.92]  you get to
[3052.92 --> 3053.80]  escape the
[3053.80 --> 3054.74]  difficulties of
[3054.74 --> 3055.08]  life
[3055.08 --> 3055.94]  death and
[3055.94 --> 3056.64]  disease and
[3056.64 --> 3057.22]  disappointment
[3057.22 --> 3059.30]  there are too
[3059.30 --> 3060.20]  many stories
[3060.20 --> 3061.56]  that I have
[3061.56 --> 3062.22]  heard and
[3062.22 --> 3062.94]  and been
[3062.94 --> 3064.26]  party to
[3064.26 --> 3064.78]  journeying
[3064.78 --> 3065.70]  alongside of
[3065.70 --> 3066.52]  or trying to
[3066.52 --> 3067.32]  that too
[3067.32 --> 3067.96]  many stories
[3067.96 --> 3068.52]  of people
[3068.52 --> 3069.38]  losing their
[3069.38 --> 3070.00]  faith or
[3070.00 --> 3071.34]  rejecting God
[3071.34 --> 3072.56]  because somehow
[3072.56 --> 3073.22]  they have
[3073.22 --> 3073.66]  come to
[3073.66 --> 3074.44]  believe that
[3074.44 --> 3075.60]  by their
[3075.60 --> 3076.80]  good Christian
[3076.80 --> 3077.48]  living whatever
[3077.48 --> 3078.22]  that means and
[3078.22 --> 3079.02]  looks like God
[3079.02 --> 3080.02]  should exempt
[3080.02 --> 3080.90]  them from
[3080.90 --> 3081.44]  struggles
[3081.44 --> 3083.72]  right sometimes
[3083.72 --> 3084.68]  we think
[3084.68 --> 3086.06]  we might never
[3086.06 --> 3086.88]  actually say this
[3086.88 --> 3088.12]  out loud but
[3088.12 --> 3089.00]  in our heart of
[3089.00 --> 3089.60]  hearts you know
[3089.60 --> 3090.60]  it's true we
[3090.60 --> 3091.70]  think how could
[3091.70 --> 3092.54]  God let this
[3092.54 --> 3093.30]  happen to me
[3093.30 --> 3096.66]  right I have
[3096.66 --> 3097.50]  been praying for
[3097.50 --> 3098.42]  years and years
[3098.42 --> 3099.50]  and years God
[3099.50 --> 3100.88]  why would you
[3100.88 --> 3103.42]  do that and
[3103.42 --> 3103.94]  what we really
[3103.94 --> 3105.24]  mean right by
[3105.24 --> 3105.86]  that is that
[3105.86 --> 3106.72]  that God is
[3106.72 --> 3107.28]  supposed to
[3107.28 --> 3108.12]  bless us and
[3108.12 --> 3109.14]  protect us from
[3109.14 --> 3109.78]  those sorts of
[3109.78 --> 3110.56]  things that that
[3110.56 --> 3111.44]  life really is
[3111.44 --> 3112.24]  supposed to be
[3112.24 --> 3114.94]  easier for
[3114.94 --> 3115.76]  somehow because
[3115.76 --> 3116.76]  you go to church
[3116.76 --> 3117.92]  every week if you
[3117.92 --> 3118.66]  come every week
[3118.66 --> 3119.66]  you shouldn't have
[3119.66 --> 3120.96]  to struggle with
[3120.96 --> 3122.12]  fertility issues or
[3122.12 --> 3123.02]  you shouldn't have
[3123.02 --> 3124.64]  to because you
[3124.64 --> 3125.80]  prayed authentically
[3125.80 --> 3126.80]  and with fasting
[3126.80 --> 3127.78]  shouldn't have to
[3127.78 --> 3128.66]  have this illness
[3128.66 --> 3130.22]  we might never say
[3130.22 --> 3131.76]  it out loud but
[3131.76 --> 3132.76]  our internal
[3132.76 --> 3134.02]  hidden anger
[3134.02 --> 3135.06]  belies the
[3135.06 --> 3137.22]  truth we think
[3137.22 --> 3137.82]  that God should
[3137.82 --> 3138.74]  protect us from
[3138.74 --> 3139.28]  the ordinary
[3139.28 --> 3140.00]  evils and
[3140.00 --> 3140.56]  struggles of
[3140.56 --> 3142.84]  life and
[3142.84 --> 3145.30]  look I really
[3145.30 --> 3146.92]  do believe that
[3146.92 --> 3148.14]  that life as a
[3148.14 --> 3149.36]  Christian is
[3149.36 --> 3150.26]  better that it
[3150.26 --> 3151.24]  is qualitatively
[3151.24 --> 3151.62]  that it is
[3151.62 --> 3153.08]  subjectively better
[3153.08 --> 3154.00]  but I also
[3154.00 --> 3154.74]  believe that life
[3154.74 --> 3155.54]  as a Christian is
[3155.54 --> 3157.04]  harder and fraught
[3157.04 --> 3157.58]  with unique
[3157.58 --> 3158.72]  challenges and
[3158.72 --> 3159.60]  trials in fact
[3159.60 --> 3160.72]  sometimes life
[3160.72 --> 3161.38]  gets more
[3161.38 --> 3162.48]  difficult when
[3162.48 --> 3163.16]  you become a
[3163.16 --> 3163.60]  Christian or
[3163.60 --> 3164.08]  when you want
[3164.08 --> 3164.56]  to live
[3164.56 --> 3165.60]  Christianly
[3165.60 --> 3167.58]  right it's
[3167.58 --> 3168.98]  hard to live
[3168.98 --> 3170.48]  sexually obedient
[3170.48 --> 3172.42]  lives when a
[3172.42 --> 3173.92]  few or most of
[3173.92 --> 3174.84]  your friends don't
[3174.84 --> 3175.36]  seem to care
[3175.36 --> 3177.46]  right it is
[3177.46 --> 3179.08]  impossible to be
[3179.08 --> 3180.22]  holy in a
[3180.22 --> 3181.04]  culture that has
[3181.04 --> 3181.88]  quite literally
[3181.88 --> 3183.40]  licensed licentious
[3183.40 --> 3183.90]  behavior
[3183.90 --> 3186.32]  right Paul says
[3186.32 --> 3186.80]  to Timothy
[3186.80 --> 3187.94]  everyone who
[3187.94 --> 3188.84]  wants to live a
[3188.84 --> 3190.04]  godly life in
[3190.04 --> 3191.34]  Christ will be
[3191.34 --> 3195.66]  persecuted and
[3195.66 --> 3196.18]  even though our
[3196.18 --> 3197.58]  faith is unique
[3197.58 --> 3198.30]  and our
[3198.30 --> 3199.28]  perspectives on
[3199.28 --> 3201.12]  suffering changes
[3201.12 --> 3203.36]  humanity is
[3203.36 --> 3204.78]  shared around the
[3204.78 --> 3206.38]  globe and yes we
[3206.38 --> 3206.86]  are rightly
[3206.86 --> 3207.96]  frustrated by
[3207.96 --> 3208.92]  inaction on
[3208.92 --> 3209.98]  social issues we
[3209.98 --> 3211.76]  cry out for
[3211.76 --> 3212.60]  justice and in
[3212.60 --> 3213.68]  part of loving our
[3213.68 --> 3214.62]  neighbor is wanting
[3214.62 --> 3215.84]  what is best for
[3215.84 --> 3216.72]  their well-being
[3216.72 --> 3219.02]  even if they
[3219.02 --> 3220.28]  refuse to believe
[3220.28 --> 3221.88]  as we do and
[3221.88 --> 3222.54]  so yeah we can
[3222.54 --> 3223.46]  empathize with
[3223.46 --> 3224.66]  people in crisis
[3224.66 --> 3225.68]  and and my heart
[3225.68 --> 3226.66]  breaks when I
[3226.66 --> 3228.28]  look around and I
[3228.28 --> 3229.78]  confess that
[3229.78 --> 3232.22]  disillusionment is
[3232.22 --> 3233.14]  an easy first
[3233.14 --> 3237.00]  reaction and I
[3237.00 --> 3238.20]  confess that apathy
[3238.20 --> 3240.36]  is a close second
[3240.36 --> 3244.08]  point is
[3244.08 --> 3246.78]  whether the water
[3246.78 --> 3248.02]  is death and the
[3248.02 --> 3248.96]  rivers are worry
[3248.96 --> 3249.84]  and the fire is
[3249.84 --> 3251.52]  disease or if the
[3251.52 --> 3253.24]  waters are rising
[3253.24 --> 3254.06]  with global
[3254.06 --> 3254.98]  temperatures and the
[3254.98 --> 3256.20]  rivers are polluted
[3256.20 --> 3257.50]  and unpotable and
[3257.50 --> 3258.70]  fires are destroying
[3258.70 --> 3259.98]  rainforests and
[3259.98 --> 3260.64]  vineyards and
[3260.64 --> 3261.90]  and mountainsides or
[3261.90 --> 3263.60]  towns or if the
[3263.60 --> 3264.78]  waters are cynicism
[3264.78 --> 3265.56]  and the rivers are
[3265.56 --> 3266.42]  disillusionment and
[3266.42 --> 3268.10]  the fires are apathy
[3268.10 --> 3270.32]  whatever they are
[3270.32 --> 3272.70]  it's common to us
[3272.70 --> 3275.22]  all and just
[3275.22 --> 3275.74]  because we're
[3275.74 --> 3277.56]  Christian doesn't
[3277.56 --> 3278.56]  mean we are exempt
[3278.56 --> 3280.48]  from that reality
[3280.48 --> 3282.46]  in fact as Jesus
[3282.46 --> 3284.06]  indicates we're
[3284.06 --> 3285.34]  more likely to
[3285.34 --> 3286.52]  expect tribulation
[3286.52 --> 3287.38]  or trial and
[3287.38 --> 3289.52]  trouble because we
[3289.52 --> 3290.24]  are disciples of
[3290.24 --> 3293.28]  Jesus and so your
[3293.28 --> 3294.58]  individual experiences
[3294.58 --> 3295.76]  of this past year
[3295.76 --> 3297.00]  may not be all
[3297.00 --> 3298.18]  that unique
[3298.18 --> 3298.68]  right the
[3298.68 --> 3299.44]  particulars of
[3299.44 --> 3300.22]  our experience
[3300.22 --> 3301.46]  are shared
[3301.46 --> 3304.32]  but the meaning
[3304.32 --> 3306.14]  that you make
[3306.14 --> 3308.26]  of those experiences
[3308.26 --> 3309.74]  of this past year
[3309.74 --> 3311.10]  the big picture
[3311.10 --> 3312.02]  interpretation
[3312.02 --> 3313.50]  of the the
[3313.50 --> 3314.34]  circumstances
[3314.34 --> 3315.90]  is different
[3315.90 --> 3317.14]  for those of us
[3317.14 --> 3317.70]  who believe
[3317.70 --> 3319.88]  because we know
[3319.88 --> 3322.18]  when you pass
[3322.18 --> 3323.10]  through the waters
[3323.10 --> 3326.66]  I will be with
[3326.66 --> 3328.78]  you we know
[3328.78 --> 3329.70]  that even though
[3329.70 --> 3330.48]  I walk through
[3330.48 --> 3331.08]  the valley of
[3331.08 --> 3331.72]  the shadow of
[3331.72 --> 3332.34]  death I will
[3332.34 --> 3333.22]  fear no evil
[3333.22 --> 3335.42]  for you are
[3335.42 --> 3336.46]  with me
[3336.46 --> 3338.18]  right we know
[3338.18 --> 3339.92]  we have God's
[3339.92 --> 3341.74]  presence and
[3341.74 --> 3342.70]  here is one of
[3342.70 --> 3343.34]  the most amazing
[3343.34 --> 3344.42]  things about God's
[3344.42 --> 3345.00]  presence that I'm
[3345.00 --> 3345.80]  only just beginning
[3345.80 --> 3346.74]  to grasp even in
[3346.74 --> 3347.42]  my own life
[3347.42 --> 3349.06]  God's presence is
[3349.06 --> 3350.32]  so much greater
[3350.32 --> 3352.52]  than my experience
[3352.52 --> 3354.06]  of God's
[3354.06 --> 3354.52]  presence
[3354.52 --> 3356.98]  right I think
[3356.98 --> 3358.10]  most of us
[3358.10 --> 3358.80]  probably know
[3358.80 --> 3359.40]  what it's like
[3359.40 --> 3360.52]  to feel as though
[3360.52 --> 3361.92]  God is distant
[3361.92 --> 3363.06]  like he doesn't
[3363.06 --> 3364.06]  draw near to us
[3364.06 --> 3365.02]  like he used to
[3365.02 --> 3365.62]  like he doesn't
[3365.62 --> 3366.42]  speak to us
[3366.42 --> 3367.52]  as he once did
[3367.52 --> 3368.26]  or as he does
[3368.26 --> 3369.06]  for that person
[3369.06 --> 3370.04]  or that person
[3370.04 --> 3370.66]  who seems to have
[3370.66 --> 3371.28]  it all together
[3371.28 --> 3371.98]  who has the kind
[3371.98 --> 3372.54]  of faith that you
[3372.54 --> 3373.16]  want to have
[3373.16 --> 3375.02]  but but even
[3375.02 --> 3376.50]  then even
[3376.50 --> 3377.58]  when we are in
[3377.58 --> 3378.34]  that dark night
[3378.34 --> 3379.12]  of the soul
[3379.12 --> 3380.10]  even when we
[3380.10 --> 3381.06]  are faithless
[3381.06 --> 3382.72]  he remains faithful
[3382.72 --> 3383.78]  for he cannot
[3383.78 --> 3384.64]  disown himself
[3384.64 --> 3386.96]  right even when
[3386.96 --> 3388.06]  my experience
[3388.06 --> 3388.80]  cries out
[3388.80 --> 3389.66]  how long oh
[3389.66 --> 3390.20]  Lord will you
[3390.20 --> 3391.08]  forget me forever
[3391.08 --> 3392.08]  right the the
[3392.08 --> 3393.62]  ontological reality
[3393.62 --> 3396.36]  is God is with us
[3396.36 --> 3397.80]  that's what verse
[3397.80 --> 3398.94]  one is about
[3398.94 --> 3399.50]  and that's what
[3399.50 --> 3400.46]  verse one is
[3400.46 --> 3401.84]  saying the truth
[3401.84 --> 3402.84]  of reality
[3402.84 --> 3403.90]  in and with
[3403.90 --> 3404.98]  God because
[3404.98 --> 3405.94]  he defines
[3405.94 --> 3407.60]  reality and this
[3407.60 --> 3408.38]  is the reality
[3408.38 --> 3409.52]  of the Christian
[3409.52 --> 3410.58]  the truth of our
[3410.58 --> 3411.62]  reality is that
[3411.62 --> 3413.92]  God is with us
[3413.92 --> 3415.46]  he created you
[3415.46 --> 3416.74]  Jacob he who
[3416.74 --> 3417.64]  formed you
[3417.64 --> 3419.70]  Israel fear not
[3419.70 --> 3420.28]  for I have
[3420.28 --> 3420.82]  redeemed you
[3420.82 --> 3421.66]  I have summoned
[3421.66 --> 3423.56]  you by name
[3423.56 --> 3425.30]  you are
[3425.30 --> 3426.64]  mine
[3426.64 --> 3427.78]  that's the Lord
[3427.78 --> 3431.02]  if by grace
[3431.02 --> 3432.04]  through faith
[3432.04 --> 3433.32]  you believe
[3433.32 --> 3434.46]  you belong
[3434.46 --> 3435.44]  to God
[3435.44 --> 3436.70]  you are not
[3436.70 --> 3437.20]  your own
[3437.20 --> 3437.58]  you've been
[3437.58 --> 3438.14]  bought with a
[3438.14 --> 3438.74]  price and you

[3439.56 --> 3440.10]  and soul

[3440.68 --> 3441.32]  and in death
[3441.32 --> 3442.32]  to your faithful
[3442.32 --> 3443.48]  savior Jesus
[3443.48 --> 3444.48]  Christ and he
[3444.48 --> 3445.52]  will never
[3445.52 --> 3446.96]  leave you
[3446.96 --> 3448.74]  you are precious
[3448.74 --> 3449.96]  and honored
[3449.96 --> 3451.16]  in his sight

[3452.78 --> 3454.16]  you his only
[3454.16 --> 3455.34]  son in exchange
[3455.34 --> 3455.82]  for you
[3455.82 --> 3457.20]  and that son
[3457.20 --> 3458.20]  now risen

[3567.34 --> 3567.70]  they are
[3567.70 --> 3568.02]  running
[3568.02 --> 3568.40]  Jesus
[3568.40 --> 3569.12]  appears to
[3569.12 --> 3569.34]  them
[3569.34 --> 3569.66]  and he
[3569.66 --> 3569.96]  says
[3569.96 --> 3570.76]  greetings
[3570.76 --> 3571.62]  do you
[3571.62 --> 3571.78]  remember

[3585.70 --> 3586.44]  speaks in
[3586.44 --> 3586.88]  that moment
[3586.88 --> 3587.64]  is so much
[3587.64 --> 3588.14]  more than

[3595.68 --> 3596.66]  long history
[3596.66 --> 3597.56]  of the
[3597.56 --> 3597.94]  prophets
[3597.94 --> 3599.12]  speaking those
[3599.12 --> 3600.08]  words throughout
[3600.08 --> 3600.74]  the ages
[3600.74 --> 3602.38]  is salvific
[3602.38 --> 3603.18]  that is relating

[3607.88 --> 3608.24]  meaning
[3608.24 --> 3608.98]  do not
[3608.98 --> 3609.48]  be afraid
[3609.48 --> 3610.02]  do not

[3611.24 --> 3612.38]  is dead
[3612.38 --> 3612.84]  do not
[3612.84 --> 3613.58]  be afraid

[3873.80 --> 3874.04]  of
[3874.04 --> 3874.46]  actually
[3874.46 --> 3874.88]  being
[3874.88 --> 3875.34]  left
[3875.34 --> 3875.64]  in
[3875.64 --> 3875.90]  our
[3875.90 --> 3876.68]  burden
[3876.68 --> 3877.04]  because
[3877.04 --> 3877.28]  if
[3877.28 --> 3877.40]  you
[3877.40 --> 3877.74]  listen
[3877.74 --> 3878.38]  closely
[3878.38 --> 3878.98]  to
[3878.98 --> 3879.12]  what
[3879.12 --> 3879.30]  I've
[3879.30 --> 3879.54]  said
[3879.54 --> 3879.78]  it's
[3879.78 --> 3880.20]  possible
[3880.20 --> 3880.42]  that
[3880.42 --> 3880.52]  you
[3880.52 --> 3880.66]  will
[3880.66 --> 3880.90]  walk
[3880.90 --> 3881.10]  out
[3881.10 --> 3881.54]  tonight
[3881.54 --> 3881.90]  or
[3881.90 --> 3882.12]  you'll
[3882.12 --> 3882.28]  turn
[3882.28 --> 3882.44]  the
[3882.44 --> 3882.68]  TV
[3882.68 --> 3883.06]  off
[3883.06 --> 3883.24]  if
[3883.24 --> 3883.40]  you're
[3883.40 --> 3883.52]  at
[3883.52 --> 3883.80]  home
[3883.80 --> 3884.26]  and
[3884.26 --> 3884.40]  you
[3884.40 --> 3884.56]  will
[3884.56 --> 3884.76]  think
[3884.76 --> 3885.14]  okay
[3885.14 --> 3886.16]  I
[3886.16 --> 3886.48]  just
[3886.48 --> 3886.84]  can't
[3886.84 --> 3887.04]  be
[3887.04 --> 3887.44]  afraid
[3887.44 --> 3888.46]  I
[3888.46 --> 3888.62]  just
[3888.62 --> 3888.76]  have
[3888.76 --> 3888.88]  to
[3888.88 --> 3889.12]  not
[3889.12 --> 3889.34]  be
[3889.34 --> 3889.72]  afraid
[3889.72 --> 3890.56]  I
[3890.56 --> 3890.72]  have
[3890.72 --> 3890.84]  to
[3890.84 --> 3891.14]  go
[3891.14 --> 3891.44]  and
[3891.44 --> 3891.66]  do
[3891.66 --> 3892.00]  things
[3892.00 --> 3892.36]  without
[3892.36 --> 3892.76]  fear
[3892.76 --> 3893.22]  and
[3893.22 --> 3893.54]  then
[3893.54 --> 3893.74]  I
[3893.74 --> 3893.90]  will
[3893.90 --> 3894.06]  have
[3894.06 --> 3894.32]  gotten
[3894.32 --> 3894.50]  it
[3894.50 --> 3894.96]  I
[3894.96 --> 3895.16]  just
[3895.16 --> 3895.32]  have
[3895.32 --> 3895.44]  to
[3895.44 --> 3895.82]  go
[3895.82 --> 3896.30]  and
[3896.30 --> 3896.64]  be
[3896.64 --> 3896.92]  an
[3896.92 --> 3897.66]  overcomer
[3897.66 --> 3900.12]  problem
[3900.12 --> 3900.76]  is
[3900.76 --> 3902.36]  you haven't
[3902.36 --> 3902.92]  actually dealt
[3902.92 --> 3903.28]  with your
[3903.28 --> 3903.70]  fear
[3903.70 --> 3905.12]  right
[3905.12 --> 3905.54]  the same
[3905.54 --> 3906.00]  thing that
[3906.00 --> 3906.78]  causes us
[3906.78 --> 3907.34]  anxiety
[3907.34 --> 3908.08]  are still
[3908.08 --> 3908.58]  giving us
[3908.58 --> 3909.12]  anxiety
[3909.12 --> 3909.84]  the same
[3909.84 --> 3910.54]  world events
[3910.54 --> 3910.92]  that make
[3910.92 --> 3911.26]  it hard
[3911.26 --> 3911.94]  to rejoice
[3911.94 --> 3912.56]  and to
[3912.56 --> 3913.20]  live
[3913.20 --> 3913.90]  boldly
[3913.90 --> 3914.56]  are still
[3914.56 --> 3915.14]  happening
[3915.14 --> 3916.26]  right
[3916.26 --> 3916.58]  and if
[3916.58 --> 3916.76]  it
[3916.76 --> 3917.38]  rests
[3917.38 --> 3917.70]  in
[3917.70 --> 3918.24]  my
[3918.24 --> 3918.88]  doing
[3918.88 --> 3921.42]  disillusionment
[3921.42 --> 3922.42]  and apathy
[3922.42 --> 3923.88]  are always
[3923.88 --> 3924.50]  close at
[3924.50 --> 3924.84]  hand
[3924.84 --> 3927.74]  but Isaiah
[3927.74 --> 3928.52]  gives us
[3928.52 --> 3929.32]  what I want
[3929.32 --> 3929.84]  to call
[3929.84 --> 3930.90]  a gospel
[3930.90 --> 3931.52]  guarantee
[3931.52 --> 3932.70]  about this
[3932.70 --> 3933.50]  new reality
[3933.50 --> 3934.24]  this new way
[3934.24 --> 3934.68]  of being
[3934.68 --> 3935.28]  in the world
[3935.28 --> 3936.00]  and I'm
[3936.00 --> 3936.64]  sorry to
[3936.64 --> 3936.82]  say
[3936.82 --> 3937.14]  no I'm
[3937.14 --> 3937.58]  not sorry

[3939.30 --> 3939.48]  say
[3939.48 --> 3939.80]  that it's
[3939.80 --> 3940.22]  not about
[3940.22 --> 3940.64]  you
[3940.64 --> 3941.78]  but the
[3941.78 --> 3942.14]  gospel
[3942.14 --> 3942.66]  guarantee
[3942.66 --> 3943.64]  is God
[3943.64 --> 3944.64]  himself
[3944.64 --> 3946.54]  when you
[3946.54 --> 3947.00]  walk
[3947.00 --> 3947.84]  through the
[3947.84 --> 3948.30]  fires
[3948.30 --> 3949.08]  you will
[3949.08 --> 3949.48]  not be

[3950.96 --> 3951.38]  set you
[3951.38 --> 3952.06]  ablaze
[3952.06 --> 3953.40]  for I

[4032.18 --> 4032.46]  no
[4032.46 --> 4032.88]  sin

[4113.38 --> 4114.52]  in his time
[4114.52 --> 4115.24]  and so yes
[4115.24 --> 4116.54]  while creation
[4116.54 --> 4118.00]  is yet groaning
[4118.00 --> 4118.94]  under the weight
[4118.94 --> 4120.00]  of sin
[4120.00 --> 4121.08]  creation is also
[4121.08 --> 4122.44]  longing as in the
[4122.44 --> 4123.34]  pangs of birth
[4123.34 --> 4125.00]  to be remade
[4125.00 --> 4125.44]  to be
[4125.44 --> 4126.44]  consummated
[4126.44 --> 4127.88]  and refined
[4127.88 --> 4128.76]  as in fire
[4128.76 --> 4129.54]  and to be
[4129.54 --> 4130.94]  made pure
[4130.94 --> 4134.54]  to the one
[4134.54 --> 4135.70]  who overcomes
[4135.70 --> 4137.16]  eternal life
[4137.16 --> 4138.20]  has already
[4138.20 --> 4139.14]  been
[4139.14 --> 4139.96]  granted
[4139.96 --> 4143.08]  so check
[4143.08 --> 4143.80]  your existential
[4143.80 --> 4144.48]  crisis
[4144.48 --> 4145.46]  at the foot
[4145.46 --> 4146.10]  of the throne
[4146.10 --> 4147.24]  the eternal
[4147.24 --> 4147.60]  king
[4147.60 --> 4150.02]  two
[4150.02 --> 4152.26]  that doesn't
[4152.26 --> 4152.60]  mean
[4152.60 --> 4153.36]  there's nothing
[4153.36 --> 4154.14]  for you to do
[4154.14 --> 4155.78]  that was a double
[4155.78 --> 4156.36]  negative so let me
[4156.36 --> 4156.78]  say it again
[4156.78 --> 4157.70]  that means
[4157.70 --> 4158.22]  there's something
[4158.22 --> 4159.04]  for you to do
[4159.04 --> 4160.90]  right
[4160.90 --> 4162.10]  because of God's
[4162.10 --> 4162.74]  presence
[4162.74 --> 4163.74]  because of the
[4163.74 --> 4164.40]  hope that you
[4164.40 --> 4165.30]  have in him
[4165.30 --> 4166.50]  you can now
[4166.50 --> 4167.74]  respond in
[4167.74 --> 4168.30]  generosity
[4168.30 --> 4169.50]  and grace
[4169.50 --> 4170.46]  and abundance
[4170.46 --> 4171.42]  to meet the
[4171.42 --> 4171.94]  challenges
[4171.94 --> 4173.02]  of our day
[4173.02 --> 4173.64]  whatever that may
[4173.64 --> 4174.24]  be whether it is
[4174.24 --> 4174.62]  climate
[4174.62 --> 4175.56]  or pandemic
[4175.56 --> 4176.62]  or politics
[4176.62 --> 4177.16]  or law
[4177.16 --> 4177.62]  injustice
[4177.62 --> 4178.28]  or poverty
[4178.28 --> 4179.04]  or death
[4179.04 --> 4179.56]  and disease
[4179.56 --> 4179.98]  whether it's
[4179.98 --> 4180.48]  persecution
[4180.48 --> 4181.62]  or martyrdom
[4181.62 --> 4182.18]  whether it's
[4182.18 --> 4182.98]  paying a social
[4182.98 --> 4183.86]  cost for being
[4183.86 --> 4184.52]  a Christian
[4184.52 --> 4185.46]  whatever trial
[4185.46 --> 4186.40]  or tribulation
[4186.40 --> 4187.24]  or trouble
[4187.24 --> 4187.82]  we face
[4187.82 --> 4189.52]  fear not
[4189.52 --> 4190.96]  for I am
[4190.96 --> 4192.08]  with you
[4192.08 --> 4194.22]  always
[4194.22 --> 4195.88]  to the very end
[4195.88 --> 4196.32]  of the age
[4196.32 --> 4198.72]  and then
[4198.72 --> 4198.98]  three
[4198.98 --> 4199.64]  take this
[4199.64 --> 4201.24]  as Christians
[4201.24 --> 4202.26]  even though
[4202.26 --> 4202.88]  the temptation
[4202.88 --> 4203.68]  is common
[4203.68 --> 4204.64]  to us all
[4204.64 --> 4205.20]  the trials
[4205.20 --> 4206.02]  are common
[4206.02 --> 4206.60]  to us all
[4206.60 --> 4207.44]  we must
[4207.44 --> 4208.56]  not be
[4208.56 --> 4209.18]  the type
[4209.18 --> 4209.76]  of people
[4209.76 --> 4210.68]  who give
[4210.68 --> 4211.22]  into
[4211.22 --> 4212.26]  disillusionment
[4212.26 --> 4213.54]  who succumb
[4213.54 --> 4214.32]  to apathy
[4214.32 --> 4215.02]  or who are
[4215.02 --> 4215.80]  ruled by
[4215.80 --> 4216.40]  fear
[4216.40 --> 4218.38]  now of course
[4218.38 --> 4219.10]  if we put
[4219.10 --> 4219.70]  our hopes
[4219.70 --> 4220.46]  in the wrong
[4220.46 --> 4220.92]  places
[4220.92 --> 4222.16]  we will always
[4222.16 --> 4222.90]  be disappointed
[4222.90 --> 4224.00]  if we put
[4224.00 --> 4224.30]  our hopes
[4224.30 --> 4224.92]  in governments
[4224.92 --> 4225.54]  in economic
[4225.54 --> 4225.94]  systems
[4225.94 --> 4226.56]  in elections
[4226.56 --> 4227.84]  in PHOs
[4227.84 --> 4228.48]  in masks
[4228.48 --> 4229.08]  and mandates
[4229.08 --> 4229.62]  or in the
[4229.62 --> 4229.98]  removal
[4229.98 --> 4231.28]  of all
[4231.28 --> 4231.92]  masks
[4231.92 --> 4232.50]  and mandates
[4232.50 --> 4232.78]  and the
[4232.78 --> 4233.12]  cancellation
[4233.12 --> 4233.72]  of all
[4233.72 --> 4234.30]  supposed
[4234.30 --> 4234.72]  government
[4234.72 --> 4235.20]  overreach
[4235.20 --> 4235.70]  if we put
[4235.70 --> 4236.02]  our hope
[4236.02 --> 4236.56]  in anything
[4236.56 --> 4237.40]  like that
[4237.40 --> 4237.88]  in anything
[4237.88 --> 4238.42]  that is not
[4238.42 --> 4239.10]  God revealed
[4239.10 --> 4239.62]  in Jesus
[4239.62 --> 4240.08]  Christ
[4240.08 --> 4240.92]  none of them
[4240.92 --> 4241.12]  are going
[4241.12 --> 4241.68]  to cut it
[4241.68 --> 4243.72]  wealth
[4243.72 --> 4244.36]  distribution
[4244.36 --> 4245.44]  or redistribution
[4245.44 --> 4246.54]  carbon taxes
[4246.54 --> 4247.60]  climate incentives
[4247.60 --> 4248.68]  aren't going
[4248.68 --> 4249.46]  to change
[4249.46 --> 4250.92]  human nature
[4250.92 --> 4253.20]  new laws
[4253.20 --> 4253.92]  more money
[4253.92 --> 4255.24]  a living wage
[4255.24 --> 4255.98]  isn't going
[4255.98 --> 4256.70]  to transform
[4256.70 --> 4257.26]  hearts
[4257.26 --> 4258.36]  and minds
[4258.36 --> 4258.78]  at least
[4258.78 --> 4259.12]  not
[4259.12 --> 4259.98]  ultimately
[4259.98 --> 4262.04]  only one
[4262.04 --> 4262.56]  person
[4262.56 --> 4263.58]  will do that
[4263.58 --> 4264.42]  and his name
[4264.42 --> 4265.10]  is
[4265.10 --> 4265.90]  Jesus
[4265.90 --> 4266.54]  Jesus
[4266.54 --> 4267.32]  by the working
[4267.32 --> 4268.60]  of the Holy Spirit
[4268.60 --> 4270.02]  in your heart
[4270.02 --> 4270.44]  and mind
[4270.44 --> 4271.14]  now all of those
[4271.14 --> 4271.90]  things that we have
[4271.90 --> 4272.30]  mentioned
[4272.30 --> 4273.52]  may be good
[4273.52 --> 4275.94]  in fact most of them
[4275.94 --> 4276.52]  are
[4276.52 --> 4277.62]  we might even
[4277.62 --> 4278.48]  fight for them
[4278.48 --> 4279.10]  we might even
[4279.10 --> 4279.98]  fight on the side
[4279.98 --> 4280.40]  of them
[4280.40 --> 4281.68]  but our hope
[4281.68 --> 4282.76]  your hope
[4282.76 --> 4284.28]  is in
[4284.28 --> 4285.28]  Jesus
[4285.28 --> 4286.64]  and he will
[4286.64 --> 4287.26]  never
[4287.26 --> 4288.34]  disappoint
[4288.34 --> 4291.34]  I am the Lord
[4291.34 --> 4291.86]  your God
[4291.86 --> 4292.70]  the Holy One
[4292.70 --> 4293.44]  of Israel
[4293.44 --> 4294.34]  your Savior
[4294.34 --> 4296.06]  you are precious
[4296.06 --> 4297.44]  and honored
[4297.44 --> 4299.04]  in my sight
[4299.04 --> 4300.96]  I love you
[4300.96 --> 4302.58]  says the Lord
[4302.58 --> 4304.16]  do not
[4304.16 --> 4304.92]  be
[4304.92 --> 4305.94]  afraid
[4305.94 --> 4307.80]  for I
[4307.80 --> 4309.40]  am with you
[4309.40 --> 4310.76]  amen
[4310.76 --> 4312.28]  let's pray

[4330.44 --> 4331.08]  the source
[4331.08 --> 4331.54]  of
[4331.54 --> 4332.62]  your gospel
[4332.62 --> 4335.74]  be to us
[4335.74 --> 4336.34]  the source
[4336.34 --> 4337.24]  of power
[4337.24 --> 4338.28]  and of true
[4338.28 --> 4339.42]  meaningful change
[4339.42 --> 4340.46]  in our lives
[4340.46 --> 4341.74]  and in this world
[4341.74 --> 4344.12]  send us out
[4344.12 --> 4344.52]  now

[4350.50 --> 4351.38]  to your
[4351.38 --> 4352.24]  purposes
[4352.24 --> 4353.34]  for us
[4353.34 --> 4355.86]  wherever we
[4355.86 --> 4356.18]  go
[4356.18 --> 4357.14]  in these next
[4357.14 --> 4357.68]  hours
[4357.68 --> 4358.96]  these next
[4358.96 --> 4359.40]  days
[4359.40 --> 4360.90]  may we
[4360.90 --> 4361.22]  know
[4361.22 --> 4361.90]  that you

[4423.00 --> 4427.78]  Through the valley of the shadow of death
[4427.78 --> 4433.32]  Your perfect love is casting out fear
[4433.32 --> 4441.58]  And even when I'm caught in the middle of the storms of this life
[4441.58 --> 4446.80]  I won't turn back, I know you are near
[4446.80 --> 4451.32]  And I will fear no fear
[4451.32 --> 4460.74]  For my God is with me
[4460.74 --> 4467.64]  And if my God is with me
[4467.64 --> 4471.30]  Whom then shall I fear?
[4471.30 --> 4475.18]  Whom then shall I fear?
[4475.18 --> 4480.12]  Oh no, you never let go
[4480.12 --> 4483.68]  Through the calm and through the storm
[4483.68 --> 4486.90]  Oh no, you never let go

[4499.26 --> 4507.26]  I can see the light that is coming
[4507.26 --> 4510.26]  For the heart that holds on
[4510.26 --> 4515.26]  A glorious light beyond all compare
[4515.26 --> 4520.50]  There will be an end to these troubles
[4520.50 --> 4523.68]  But until that day comes
[4523.68 --> 4528.68]  We'll live to know you here on this earth
[4528.68 --> 4535.68]  And I will fear no evil
[4535.68 --> 4542.10]  For my God is with me
[4542.10 --> 4550.10]  And if my God is with me
[4550.10 --> 4551.52]  Whom then shall I fear?

[4588.52 --> 4591.84]  For the heart that holds on
[4591.84 --> 4595.50]  There will be a debt to these troubles
[4595.50 --> 4599.18]  But until that day comes
[4599.18 --> 4603.22]  Still I will praise you
[4603.22 --> 4606.78]  Still I will praise you
[4606.78 --> 4615.50]  Yes, I can see the light that is coming

[4659.38 --> 4680.60]  We go now with our God who goes with us
[4680.60 --> 4682.74]  And never leave us nor forsake us
[4682.74 --> 4685.88]  And so go with his blessing
[4685.88 --> 4689.24]  God go before you
