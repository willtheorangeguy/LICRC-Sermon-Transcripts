[0.00 → 15.34] Oh, you are God, and we lift you up, we'll keep singing, we'll keep praising, we won't
[15.34 → 21.70] stop giving all we got, because you're worthy of all glory.
[21.70 → 38.70] Oh, there is no other, you are forever, Lord over all, there's nobody like you, no one beside you, that's what we sing out to you.
[38.70 → 50.62] Oh, let endless praise resound, every night and day, and with no delay, let endless praise resound.
[51.14 → 51.90] Let's go!
[51.90 → 81.88] Let's go!
[81.90 → 98.90] Creation, keep singing, oh, there is no other, you are forever, Lord over all, there's nobody like you, no one beside you.
[98.90 → 114.08] To you, let endless praise resound, every night and day, and with no delay, let endless praise resound.
[114.08 → 132.10] Let's go!
[132.10 → 147.32] We lift you up, up, up
[147.32 → 151.06] We're giving you our love, love, love
[151.06 → 154.74] For everything you've done, done, done
[154.74 → 159.58] Oh, we give you all the praise
[159.58 → 162.28] We lift you up, up, up
[162.28 → 166.00] We're giving you our love, love, love
[166.00 → 169.78] For everything you've done, done, done
[169.78 → 174.72] Oh, we give you all the praise
[174.72 → 175.72] Let's go!
[175.72 → 190.42] Oh, we give you all the praise
[190.42 → 196.92] To you, let endless praise resound
[196.92 → 201.12] Every night and day, and with no delay
[201.12 → 204.50] Let endless praise resound
[204.50 → 211.58] To you, let endless praise resound
[211.58 → 216.28] Every night and day, and with no delay
[216.28 → 219.40] Let endless praise resound
[219.40 → 221.20] To you
[221.20 → 222.78] Let endless praise resound
[223.72 → 225.80] All tolerated
[225.80 → 228.42] I've got one
[228.48 → 229.52] Oh, I love
[229.52 → 231.24] Oh, I love
[231.24 → 232.06] Oh, I love
[232.06 → 232.90] Oh, I love
[232.90 → 233.30] I love
[233.30 → 234.42] Oh, I love
[234.42 → 236.40] Oh, I love
[236.40 → 236.68] Ah...
[236.68 → 237.18] Ah...
[237.92 → 238.44] Oh, I love
[238.44 → 239.32] Oh, I love
[239.32 → 240.24] Oh, I love
[240.24 → 241.04] Oh, I love
[241.04 → 255.36] I can see it clearly now.
[255.36 → 259.24] There's a reason for this sign.
[261.08 → 262.64] It's Jesus.
[266.16 → 270.16] At the core of who I am.
[270.16 → 274.40] Is the written Son of man.
[276.04 → 277.40] It's Jesus.
[280.00 → 280.60] Yeah.
[281.60 → 284.10] You're like no other.
[285.30 → 287.56] For your love is greater.
[289.02 → 293.16] And you are the centre of it all.
[294.16 → 295.92] It's all about you.
[295.92 → 296.18] Yeah.
[297.18 → 299.62] It's all about you.
[300.16 → 303.32] It's all about you.
[304.40 → 307.00] It's all about you.
[307.90 → 308.24] Yeah.
[308.24 → 308.74] Yeah.
[308.74 → 309.98] Yeah.
[309.98 → 312.22] Yeah.
[312.36 → 313.48] Yeah.
[319.12 → 320.00] Yeah.
[320.10 → 320.60] Yeah.
[320.60 → 321.28] Yeah.
[321.56 → 321.92] Yeah.
[321.92 → 322.02] Yeah.
[322.02 → 322.52] Yeah.
[322.52 → 324.60] Yeah.
[325.00 → 327.90] Yeah.
[327.90 → 338.30] I exist to bring you praise and to shout no other name but Jesus
[342.70 → 348.46] you're like no other for your love is greater
[350.06 → 353.58] and you are the centre of it all
[357.90 → 359.90] it's all about you
[361.90 → 363.90] it's all about you
[365.90 → 367.90] it's all about you
[367.90 → 369.90] yeah
[377.90 → 379.90] come on
[379.90 → 381.90] many
[383.90 → 385.90] do
[385.90 → 390.08] It's all about you
[390.08 → 394.02] It's all about you
[394.02 → 397.70] It's all about you
[397.70 → 404.82] You are the first, you are the last
[404.82 → 408.54] You are my future, because you're from my past
[408.54 → 412.08] You are the reason why I say
[412.08 → 415.98] It's all about you
[415.98 → 419.78] It's all about you
[419.78 → 423.32] I'm living for you
[423.32 → 427.44] It's all about you
[442.08 → 445.74] It's all about you
[445.74 → 447.98] It's all about you
[447.98 → 469.98] Come on, jerk, put your hands up
[469.98 → 476.68] Hey, hey, hey, hey
[476.68 → 479.78] Let's go
[479.78 → 493.66] I want to hear you sing this out with us
[493.66 → 498.10] I will not be shaken
[498.10 → 502.90] When troubles come, you're the one I call
[502.90 → 505.72] You are my foundation
[505.72 → 510.26] A solid rock I will stand on
[510.26 → 514.14] There's no need to fear for the battle is won
[514.14 → 517.10] The battle is won in you
[517.10 → 520.84] My future is short for my God
[520.84 → 521.84] You are strong
[521.84 → 524.78] My God, you are breaking through
[524.78 → 526.88] If death is defeated
[526.88 → 530.70] All praise to you, Jesus
[530.70 → 535.30] If death is defeated
[535.30 → 538.10] Then I'll be considered against
[538.10 → 538.90] Come on, church
[538.90 → 541.34] The name of Jesus
[541.34 → 556.20] Somebody make some noise in this place
[556.20 → 560.00] You're my only focus
[560.00 → 560.80] You're my only focus
[560.80 → 564.96] The only way to a life of freedom
[564.96 → 568.00] You await my purpose
[568.00 → 571.66] Now I live for your kingdom
[571.66 → 576.04] There's no need to fear for the battle is won
[576.04 → 578.98] The battle is won in you
[578.98 → 582.80] My future is short for my God
[582.80 → 583.68] You are strong
[583.68 → 586.74] My God, you are breaking through
[586.74 → 588.78] If death is defeated
[588.78 → 592.60] All praise to you, Jesus
[592.60 → 597.20] If death is defeated
[597.20 → 600.36] Then I think it's considered against
[600.36 → 603.42] In the name of Jesus
[603.42 → 611.42] Nothing is shared against
[611.42 → 616.74] I want to see everybody getting up in this place
[616.74 → 621.40] Good morning!
[622.18 → 625.04] Welcome to church and Happy New Year!
[627.36 → 630.12] Oh, it was a happier New Year over here, I think,
[630.12 → 631.72] Based on that response
[631.72 → 634.70] Oh, there you go
[634.70 → 637.44] It was the happiest of New Year's for Lena
[637.44 → 638.34] Excellent
[638.34 → 641.90] If you're participating with us online
[641.90 → 643.58] We just had a little interaction here
[643.58 → 644.52] That you didn't hear
[644.52 → 646.38] So sorry that you missed that part
[646.38 → 648.30] To you online, welcome
[648.30 → 650.44] And thank you for joining us as well
[650.44 → 651.18] My name is Chris
[651.18 → 653.16] I'm one of the pastors here
[653.16 → 656.08] And it's my privilege, along with these on stage
[656.08 → 657.18] And yet a couple others
[657.18 → 659.04] To lead us in our worship
[659.04 → 661.36] This New Year's
[661.36 → 665.22] Or this first Sunday of New Year's together
[665.22 → 668.94] We are excited to kick this year off
[668.94 → 670.22] With worship
[670.22 → 673.18] We know that there are all sorts of chaoses
[673.18 → 676.22] That are challenging our attentions
[676.22 → 677.14] And our focus
[677.14 → 679.62] And things that are drawing us
[679.62 → 681.24] And pulling us this way and that
[681.24 → 682.86] And we want to just centre ourselves
[682.86 → 684.94] On God and with Him
[684.94 → 687.26] For an hour or so
[687.26 → 688.22] Together
[688.22 → 690.22] Before we begin
[690.22 → 692.70] I just want to make one announcement
[692.70 → 695.98] And then Kevin is going to make an announcement as well
[695.98 → 701.44] But with the delayed return to school for kids
[701.44 → 705.26] We are also pushing back the start of the cadet program
[705.26 → 707.60] Which was scheduled to start this week
[707.60 → 709.66] And so we have in the past
[709.66 → 711.54] Tied our children's programs
[711.54 → 713.28] To the school programs
[713.28 → 714.84] And so
[714.84 → 716.98] As providing clarity and consistency
[716.98 → 718.52] So we wanted to just put that out
[718.52 → 719.36] For the cadets
[719.36 → 721.00] That's our boys group
[721.00 → 724.06] You're not starting this week Thursday
[724.06 → 725.10] But you will start
[725.10 → 726.24] Lord willing
[726.24 → 728.62] Two weeks removed from that
[728.62 → 730.80] But we'll have a staff meeting this week
[730.80 → 732.42] To discuss the rest of our ministries
[732.42 → 734.20] With everything else that's going on as well
[734.20 → 735.60] So you hear that
[735.60 → 737.00] And then Kevin has one more
[737.00 → 740.64] It's coming
[740.64 → 741.12] There it is
[741.12 → 741.86] Good morning everyone
[741.86 → 744.42] I wanted to give a giant thank you
[744.42 → 745.46] To all of you here
[745.46 → 746.36] All of you online
[746.36 → 748.48] And people beyond the walls of this church as well
[748.48 → 750.24] For a very successful Dress ember
[750.24 → 750.76] The youth
[750.76 → 751.84] A bunch of the youth and leaders
[751.84 → 752.54] And some parents
[752.54 → 753.76] Wore dresses and ties
[753.76 → 755.06] The whole month of December
[755.06 → 756.24] To raise awareness
[756.24 → 757.40] And funds
[757.40 → 759.40] To fight human trafficking in this world
[759.40 → 761.12] And we raised over
[761.12 → 762.78] It was about $7,600
[762.78 → 764.62] So just a huge thank you
[764.62 → 766.24] To all who were involved in that
[766.24 → 768.22] For being bombarded online
[768.22 → 769.12] On social media
[769.12 → 770.22] With constant posts
[770.22 → 771.06] And pictures of people
[771.06 → 771.92] In ties and dresses
[771.92 → 774.20] It was I would say a big success
[774.20 → 776.16] So both the awareness portion
[776.16 → 777.18] And the funds portion
[777.18 → 777.78] Went very well
[777.78 → 778.68] So a big thank you
[778.68 → 779.44] To all of you
[779.44 → 779.96] Thanks
[779.96 → 787.66] Let's kick off
[787.66 → 789.78] Our new year of worship together
[789.78 → 790.24] Shall we?
[790.32 → 791.00] Why don't you stand
[791.00 → 791.70] If you're able
[791.70 → 792.98] And present here
[792.98 → 795.78] And take on
[795.78 → 797.26] A posture of worship
[797.26 → 798.14] And of receipt
[798.14 → 799.70] As we enter into
[799.70 → 800.62] God's presence
[800.62 → 801.68] Together
[801.68 → 802.62] Receive the greeting
[802.62 → 803.62] Of our God
[803.62 → 805.32] Grace
[805.32 → 806.88] Mercy
[806.88 → 808.20] And peace
[808.20 → 808.86] To you
[808.86 → 810.12] From God
[810.12 → 810.64] Our Father
[810.64 → 811.18] From the Lord
[811.18 → 811.88] Jesus Christ
[811.88 → 812.44] His Son
[812.44 → 813.44] And our Saviour
[813.44 → 814.54] Through the presence
[814.54 → 815.30] And power
[815.30 → 816.80] Of the Holy Spirit
[816.80 → 819.12] Amen
[819.12 → 821.12] Before we start
[821.12 → 822.42] It's a new year
[822.42 → 823.24] So I'm going to do this
[823.24 → 824.00] Okay
[824.00 → 826.04] When my hands go from here
[826.04 → 826.78] To here
[826.78 → 828.56] That's your cue
[828.56 → 829.12] To say
[829.12 → 829.74] Amen
[829.74 → 832.18] So I'm not going to say
[832.18 → 833.20] And all God's people said
[833.20 → 834.54] That's just your cue
[834.54 → 835.68] I've been trying for a year
[835.68 → 836.32] To get you guys
[836.32 → 837.08] To figure that out
[837.08 → 838.50] And you haven't done it
[838.50 → 839.56] And so now
[839.56 → 840.88] I'm explicitly stating
[840.88 → 842.34] My hands are up here
[842.34 → 842.90] Giving the blessing
[842.90 → 843.94] And they move down here
[843.94 → 845.52] Amen
[845.52 → 846.46] Thank you
[846.46 → 848.34] Liturgical practices
[848.34 → 848.94] We're learning
[848.94 → 854.50] Our call to worship
[854.50 → 855.12] This morning
[855.12 → 856.92] Comes from a favourite verse
[856.92 → 860.74] Jeremiah 29 verse 11
[860.74 → 862.56] For I know the plans
[862.56 → 863.40] I have for you
[863.40 → 864.34] Declares the Lord
[864.34 → 866.40] Plans to prosper you
[866.40 → 867.88] And not to harm you
[867.88 → 869.74] Plans to give you hope
[869.74 → 870.72] And a future
[870.72 → 874.10] Whether 2021 brought us success
[874.10 → 875.84] Fulfillment and joy
[875.84 → 877.28] Or we faced grief
[877.28 → 878.64] Or setbacks
[878.64 → 880.12] Or frustrations and trouble
[880.12 → 882.86] We can know that God was with us
[882.86 → 884.22] Every step of the way
[884.22 → 887.02] We can look forward to this new year again
[887.02 → 887.82] With the hope
[887.82 → 888.88] And the assurance
[888.88 → 889.98] That our Heavenly Father
[889.98 → 891.24] Is faithful and good
[891.24 → 892.76] And He loves us
[892.76 → 894.82] He cares deeply for us
[894.82 → 897.70] And He will always be with us
[897.70 → 899.72] With this hope in mind
[899.72 → 900.34] Let's pray
[900.34 → 902.60] Heavenly Father
[902.60 → 904.16] Thank you that you make
[904.16 → 905.10] All things new
[905.10 → 907.18] As another year has begun
[907.18 → 908.36] Help us to live
[908.36 → 909.44] Every day for you
[909.44 → 911.58] No matter what comes our way
[911.58 → 913.14] We trust you
[913.14 → 913.16] We trust you
[913.16 → 915.46] Because we know you have a plan for us
[915.46 → 917.14] And your mercies are new
[917.14 → 917.94] Every morning
[917.94 → 919.54] And nothing ahead of us
[919.54 → 921.32] Will take you by surprise
[921.32 → 924.04] We praise you for your unfailing goodness
[924.04 → 925.24] And love for us
[925.24 → 927.82] In Jesus' precious name we pray
[927.82 → 929.70] Amen
[929.70 → 931.96] Please join us in singing
[931.96 → 933.24] Of the goodness of God
[933.24 → 945.04] I love you Lord
[945.04 → 949.70] Oh your mercy never fails me
[949.70 → 953.52] All my days
[953.52 → 957.64] I've been held in your hands
[957.64 → 961.24] From the moment that I wake up
[961.24 → 964.76] Until I lay my head
[964.76 → 967.04] I will sing
[967.04 → 971.64] Of the goodness of God
[971.64 → 972.64] I love you Lord
[972.64 → 975.86] And all my life
[975.86 → 978.24] You have been faithful
[978.24 → 983.06] And all my life
[983.06 → 986.88] You have been so, so good
[986.88 → 992.64] With every breath that I am able
[992.64 → 995.86] I will sing
[995.86 → 999.46] Of the goodness of God
[999.46 → 1004.14] I love your voice
[1004.14 → 1008.26] You have led me through the fire
[1008.26 → 1011.72] In darkest night
[1011.72 → 1015.18] You are close like no other
[1015.18 → 1018.84] I've known you as a father
[1018.84 → 1023.00] I've known you as a friend
[1023.00 → 1025.70] And I have lived
[1025.70 → 1029.00] In the goodness of God
[1029.00 → 1033.68] And all my life
[1033.68 → 1036.60] You have been faithful
[1036.60 → 1041.28] And all my life
[1041.28 → 1045.00] You have been so, so good
[1045.00 → 1050.68] With every breath that I am able
[1050.68 → 1055.36] I will sing
[1055.36 → 1058.28] Of the goodness of God

[1066.32 → 1070.56] Your goodness is running after you
[1070.56 → 1073.28] It's running after me
[1073.28 → 1075.60] With my life laid down
[1075.60 → 1077.40] I surrender now

[1084.96 → 1087.28] It's running after me
[1087.28 → 1091.96] Your goodness is running after you
[1091.96 → 1094.72] It's running after me

[1102.32 → 1104.10] With my life laid down

[1143.96 → 1148.18] I will sing of the goodness of God
[1148.18 → 1154.46] I will sing of the goodness of God
[1154.46 → 1182.88] You unravel me
[1182.88 → 1185.82] With a melody
[1185.82 → 1189.58] You surround me
[1189.58 → 1192.72] With a song
[1192.72 → 1197.12] Of deliverance
[1197.12 → 1200.54] From my enemies
[1200.54 → 1206.30] Till all my fears are gone
[1206.30 → 1213.56] I'm no longer a slave to fear
[1213.56 → 1220.46] I am a child of all

[1241.92 → 1245.96] You have chosen me

[1315.06 → 1321.06] I am a child of God
[1321.06 → 1340.38] You split the sea so I could walk right through it
[1340.38 → 1345.06] My fears are drowned in perfect God
[1345.06 → 1352.38] You rescued me so I could stand
[1352.38 → 1353.38] And sing
[1353.38 → 1359.70] I am a child of God
[1359.70 → 1361.70] You saved me so I could stand

[1406.98 → 1414.98] Our next song is a song called Stronger, which I know the kids know quite well, and in particular the actions to the song.
[1414.98 → 1417.98] So we would love to see you doing those actions
[1417.98 → 1421.98] And maybe if you do them big enough, the adults will join you and be inspired
[1421.98 → 1423.98] So here we go
[1423.98 → 1452.98] There is love that came for us
[1452.98 → 1457.98] Humble to a sinner's cross
[1457.98 → 1462.98] You broke by shame and sinfulness
[1462.98 → 1468.98] You rose again victorious
[1468.98 → 1475.98] Faithfulness none can deny
[1475.98 → 1480.98] Through the storm and through the fire
[1480.98 → 1485.98] There is truth that sets me free
[1485.98 → 1491.98] Jesus Christ who lives in me
[1491.98 → 1494.98] You are stronger
[1494.98 → 1496.98] You are stronger

[1520.98 → 1523.98] And no end
[1523.98 → 1525.98] You're my hope
[1525.98 → 1527.98] And my defence
[1527.98 → 1528.98] You came to see
[1528.98 → 1530.98] You came to see
[1530.98 → 1532.98] And save the lost
[1532.98 → 1534.98] You paid it all
[1534.98 → 1536.98] You paid it all
[1536.98 → 1541.98] Upon the cross

[1637.24 → 1639.64] It is written
[1639.64 → 1642.12] Christ is risen
[1642.12 → 1648.00] Jesus, you are Lord of all
[1648.00 → 1651.30] You may have a seat

[2056.30 → 2057.30] through formulate
[2057.30 → 2058.44] and if as a Glop
[2058.44 → 2059.30] you're understanding
[2059.30 → 2060.30] Lord clearly
[2060.30 → 2061.98] as a Egg
[2061.98 → 2068.30] Why don't we have the kids come on up to the front. We're going to do children's blessing
[2068.30 → 2073.48] after I pray, and then you guys are going to head out. I understand your children's worship time
[2073.48 → 2080.34] leaders have some fun activities in store for you. So before I pray, I have a quick question.
[2081.04 → 2088.26] How many of you stayed up till midnight on New Year's Eve? Oh, I'm in such good company. Me neither.
[2088.26 → 2096.04] Oh, it's so much nicer just to go to bed, right? No, Malachi. That's my son, everyone,
[2096.50 → 2105.46] who defiantly says no. No, I think it is. You know what? Today we are remembering and seeing,
[2105.60 → 2110.04] maybe for the first time, who we are in Jesus. And what I want you guys to know before you go
[2110.04 → 2113.50] into children's worship time, and what we're going to spend some time talking about here,
[2113.50 → 2123.42] is that you are loved. Loved by God, loved by Jesus, and loved by us at this church. And so,
[2123.98 → 2128.78] without sounding creepy, I love you. I want you to know that.
[2130.60 → 2135.02] My daughter just rolled her eyes at me. This isn't going well for me, guys.
[2135.02 → 2138.24] Let's pray together, okay?
[2141.86 → 2148.94] Lord Jesus, we thank you for your love, and I pray that each of these little ones here with us
[2148.94 → 2159.00] and at home listening would know that love today. Love us so that we can love you. In Jesus' name we pray.
[2159.00 → 2166.42] Amen. All right, let's stand up. We're going to do the children's blessing. Do we need to practice it,
[2166.44 → 2171.00] or do you think we can just do it straight off? Straight off. Okay, let's do it. Ready?
[2171.70 → 2180.14] Hands up. The Lord be with you. Amen. Good job, guys. Head on out.
[2189.00 → 2204.74] Testing, testing. Working? It's good. All right. Good.
[2209.74 → 2213.54] Well, I kind of wanted to say this to you all. Happy New Year. You know, New Year's Eve,
[2213.54 → 2218.10] when midnight comes, everybody says, Happy New Year. So, I'm saying that to you this morning.
[2218.10 → 2223.98] Happy New Year. It's good to see you all this morning. I trust you all had a good Christmas break.
[2225.90 → 2231.78] As you reflect on last year and start approaching this year, you can probably—that song this morning
[2231.78 → 2238.14] that the worship team was leading the first song, the chorus, Your Goodness is Running After Me.
[2238.60 → 2242.76] I think at times when we start thinking about the next year, we reflect on the past year,
[2242.76 → 2247.34] and you realize that it was—for some, it was a rough year, but there are still a lot of blessings
[2247.34 → 2251.72] and a lot of goodness, and it's interesting how that line says, Your Goodness is Running After Me.
[2251.72 → 2254.42] I felt that. That was kind of a nice way to put it.
[2254.42 → 2263.90] This past year has been a year—I call it the year of the glasses for me. I'm wearing glasses a lot more than I want to,
[2263.90 → 2269.26] so I'm calling that the year of the glasses. For me, that's how I'm terming it, so it's kind of one of those things.
[2269.26 → 2271.74] I'm not wearing them right now, but you will see them soon, I'm sure.
[2271.74 → 2280.18] We had a good Christmas break in our home. It's been good for some of you. We have a couple older kids,
[2280.18 → 2285.92] so we got another grandkid this Christmas, so we're excited about that, so that's exciting in our home.
[2285.92 → 2289.40] So we've had a good Christmas, and I hope you all have, too.
[2289.40 → 2296.40] The new year, 2022 comes. New things, new opportunities, new start.
[2296.40 → 2303.22] I hope you all have some time to reflect on that a little bit as 22 comes around.
[2303.22 → 2308.32] Also, there are some unknowns that I'm sure are going to happen and may cause some anxiety, some new challenges,
[2308.32 → 2313.80] hardships, sickness, and loss. I'm sure that's all going to touch all our lives as 22 comes along as well.
[2313.80 → 2320.78] You always hear lots about New Year's resolutions at this time of year, and it's kind of comical.
[2320.78 → 2324.36] Even on a couple of days ago, you see a lot more people running on the streets already,
[2324.36 → 2327.30] trying to get back into shape and adding new things to their life.
[2327.38 → 2329.62] They want to turn over a new lease, so that's kind of good.
[2329.74 → 2337.62] So I'm sure many of you have new goals and new ideas that you want to have for this coming year,
[2337.68 → 2341.54] and pray that God will bless you with that and help you with those things.
[2341.54 → 2345.08] I'm also up here as council, as chair.
[2345.08 → 2348.60] I want to thank everybody for a great year we had last year with our staff,
[2348.60 → 2352.80] and a lot of the initiatives we've done around the church, including this sanctuary.
[2352.80 → 2358.58] It's looking perfect, and we're well on our way to our goal of getting new chairs, so that's exciting, too.
[2360.78 → 2363.66] Speaking of New Year's resolutions, if I can make this point,
[2363.72 → 2368.90] if any of you want to add or give more time in committees and opportunities here at the church,
[2368.90 → 2373.66] I would ask that you would consider that in your New Year's resolution planning over the next few days.
[2373.78 → 2376.98] There are some committees and groups in our church that need some additional help yet,
[2377.04 → 2379.78] so if you feel like you could give some time to that, that would be fantastic.
[2382.42 → 2384.54] On that note, we'll just begin in prayer.
[2384.54 → 2390.34] Dear Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be your name.
[2391.32 → 2394.84] Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
[2395.80 → 2401.66] Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our sins as we forgive those who have sinned against us.
[2402.72 → 2405.32] Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[2405.74 → 2409.46] For yours is the kingdom, the power, and the glory forever and ever.
[2409.46 → 2413.84] Thank you, Lord, for this prayer that you have given us.
[2414.50 → 2418.84] This is a prayer we need to recite often, but very appropriate as we start the new year,
[2419.36 → 2423.68] as we put 2021 behind us and anticipate the year 2022 ahead.
[2424.82 → 2428.24] May we keep you as our compass and lean on you throughout this new year.
[2429.56 → 2432.62] May we celebrate the blessings from you of the coming year
[2432.62 → 2435.98] and realize that all blessings are from you,
[2436.10 → 2440.36] and may we trust in you when trials, challenges, and loss come in 2022.
[2441.22 → 2445.40] That our lives are in your hands, and you will not burden us with more than we can handle.
[2447.06 → 2450.32] Lord, we ask that you bless this church and congregation in 2022.
[2451.54 → 2455.22] May we draw closer as a community and seek to spread your word in our world.
[2456.00 → 2459.62] We ask you that you bless our ministries and programs that we have here at Emmanuel,
[2459.62 → 2462.66] that they will be successful in 2022.
[2464.72 → 2468.48] Please bless our staff as they facilitate the responsibilities they have.
[2469.04 → 2472.52] Give them courage and strength to manage the challenges that they encounter.
[2473.08 → 2477.56] May their work bear fruit and see your spirit working in the lives of those they shepherd.
[2479.18 → 2484.36] Lord, we ask that you bless the work of the council as they lead the church through 2020-22.
[2484.36 → 2490.14] May your spirit work and lead us as we navigate through the day-to-day work of council
[2490.14 → 2492.68] as well as the big picture, long-term direction.
[2494.72 → 2497.68] COVID is not going away, and it continues to affect our lives.
[2498.66 → 2502.70] Lord, we think of schools and governments that need to constantly navigate these challenges,
[2503.08 → 2506.88] as well as parents that have to navigate this as well with their children.
[2506.88 → 2513.86] We think of those who are sick with COVID or the common flu, and we offer prayer for those here now, too.
[2515.74 → 2520.08] As Christians and followers of you, we sit here at the start of 2022.
[2521.10 → 2525.94] With you, Lord, on our corner, we can say about 2022, bring it on.
[2526.84 → 2530.20] We look forward to this year to see blessings you will shower on us.
[2530.84 → 2533.50] Help us to start this year with this sense of optimism.
[2533.50 → 2539.68] If we struggle with loneliness or sickness, maybe we struggle with mental health issues
[2539.68 → 2541.30] or know someone who is struggling.
[2542.14 → 2544.40] Maybe we know of or are dealing with addictions.
[2545.70 → 2548.54] My prayer is that, or our prayer is that, all of us will challenge,
[2549.78 → 2553.50] all of us with our challenges can enter this next year with a sense of optimism
[2553.50 → 2558.70] and be able to open our hearts to let God's power in to heal and to cause change.
[2560.42 → 2562.52] We thank you, Lord, for all you have given us.
[2562.52 → 2564.82] We eagerly await your return.
[2565.38 → 2569.84] But as we wait, Lord, may we continue to strive to be a light for you in this world,
[2570.30 → 2574.56] at work, at play, or just walking down the street or at the mall.
[2575.70 → 2577.76] We ask all this in your name alone.
[2578.02 → 2578.22] Amen.
[2592.52 → 2611.74] We're going to spend some time together this morning in God's Word in Ephesians 1.
[2612.04 → 2618.42] I'm going to encourage you to have a Bible in front of you as we'll spend some significant time there.
[2618.42 → 2620.94] It will be on the screen behind me.
[2622.22 → 2626.26] But, of course, I think it's better to have something in your hands,
[2626.32 → 2630.44] whether it's a Bible or your phone device on the text there.
[2633.96 → 2638.58] Before I read this text, let me set up a bit of a context for you.
[2638.58 → 2641.66] We've just come out of the Christmas season here,
[2642.38 → 2647.68] a season where most of us got or gave gifts.
[2647.68 → 2655.34] And I want to know if you got what you wanted.
[2656.92 → 2660.78] Did you get what was on your list, right?
[2660.86 → 2663.52] Did everything that you submitted get crossed off?
[2663.58 → 2665.12] Now, some of you are shaking your head yes.
[2665.44 → 2667.54] Some of you are too scared to shake your head no.
[2667.86 → 2671.58] And you're wondering what mom or dad or the person beside you is going to think.
[2671.84 → 2673.46] I can tell you I got what I wanted.
[2673.46 → 2676.60] I got this beautiful set of knife sharpening stones.
[2677.64 → 2680.58] Maybe you don't know this about me, but usually not on Sundays,
[2680.72 → 2683.60] but I carry a folding knife in my pocket with me wherever I go.
[2684.42 → 2688.02] And it has gotten really dull, and I needed to sharpen it.
[2688.22 → 2692.64] And so my mother-in-law got me this beautiful set of four different thousand grit
[2692.64 → 2695.20] to 8,000 grit sharpening stones.
[2695.26 → 2699.12] And I'm super excited to spend time getting my knife to that razor.
[2699.32 → 2700.54] Anyway, you don't care about that.
[2700.54 → 2705.00] I got what I wanted, and my list was checked off.
[2707.10 → 2714.02] As we read this text, I want you to think about getting what you wanted
[2714.02 → 2717.76] or getting what you need or thinking you got what you need
[2717.76 → 2719.86] or having more or needing more.
[2720.04 → 2726.58] And then through that lens, hear what Paul says to the church at Ephesus.
[2727.74 → 2729.62] Ephesians 1, I'm going to start in verse 3.
[2730.54 → 2736.28] Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[2736.42 → 2743.80] who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ.
[2745.10 → 2751.70] For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight.
[2751.70 → 2759.96] In love, he predestined us for adoption to son ship through Jesus Christ,
[2759.96 → 2765.50] in accordance with his pleasure and will, to the praise of his glorious grace,
[2765.64 → 2769.36] which he has freely given us in the one he loves.
[2770.44 → 2775.64] In him, we have the redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins,
[2775.64 → 2780.94] in accordance with the riches of God's grace that he lavished on us.
[2782.10 → 2787.16] With all wisdom and understanding, he made known to us the mystery of his will,
[2787.48 → 2790.90] according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in Christ,
[2790.96 → 2794.02] to be put into effect when the times reach their fulfillment,
[2794.02 → 2799.16] to bring unity to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ.
[2799.16 → 2805.78] In him, you were also chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of him
[2805.78 → 2809.58] who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will,
[2810.14 → 2814.20] in order that we, who were the first to put our hope in Christ,
[2814.58 → 2818.12] might be for the praise of his glory.
[2818.90 → 2822.88] And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth,
[2822.98 → 2824.86] the gospel of your salvation.
[2824.86 → 2829.22] When you believed, you were marked in him with a seal,
[2829.42 → 2831.44] the promised Holy Spirit,
[2831.78 → 2835.26] who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance
[2835.26 → 2840.32] until the redemption of those who are God's possession,
[2841.02 → 2844.80] to the praise of his glory.
[2845.82 → 2847.10] This is the word of the Lord.
[2849.92 → 2852.10] Like we said, we just came through Christmas,
[2852.10 → 2855.86] and more recently, even than that, we just celebrated.
[2856.86 → 2861.10] Maybe celebrated is too strong a word for the kinds of things we got to do on New Year's Eve,
[2861.22 → 2866.56] but we just celebrated New Year's Eve and this new year.
[2866.82 → 2872.42] And as Eric mentioned, at the end of a year, we tend to take stock.
[2872.78 → 2876.94] We take a look at our life, and we see what is.
[2877.04 → 2879.98] We tend to make plans and have hopes for the future.
[2879.98 → 2884.00] We look at our life, we look at the things that we have,
[2884.04 → 2886.26] or the things that we have just recently got,
[2886.42 → 2890.56] and we begin to identify something that is lacking,
[2890.88 → 2893.12] or something that we want to change,
[2893.24 → 2896.88] or something that we want to make more of, or experience more of.
[2896.96 → 2899.32] And so we make resolutions.
[2900.44 → 2902.90] We make plans, we make resolutions,
[2902.90 → 2904.86] we look at what we have,
[2904.86 → 2912.78] and we begin to chart a path forward into the new year.
[2913.82 → 2916.60] And we're going to do the same thing together this morning,
[2916.60 → 2923.20] but in reference to our identity in Christ,
[2923.56 → 2926.30] as Christians, as those who believe.
[2926.30 → 2930.06] And so if you are here this morning, and you're not sure if you are a Christian,
[2930.74 → 2935.68] I hold this out to you to whet your spiritual appetites.
[2935.78 → 2941.54] I hold this out to you as a picture of what could be in your heart and in your mind.
[2941.64 → 2945.62] And if you are here this morning as a Christian or watching online,
[2945.62 → 2949.54] I hope that this is an encouragement and a reminder,
[2949.84 → 2958.12] and you find yourself firmly in who God has created you and recreated you to be.
[2960.18 → 2961.60] Now the thing is,
[2962.12 → 2965.80] the longer you've been in a church community,
[2966.94 → 2972.14] it seems to me the more familiar you are with Jesus,
[2972.14 → 2978.50] the easier it is to forget what he says about you.
[2980.96 → 2984.98] The more familiar you are with these teachings
[2984.98 → 2987.50] or with coming to church for a lifetime,
[2987.90 → 2992.92] the easier it is to forget or to take for granted who he says you are.
[2994.32 → 2999.72] I want to start this way because I want to set up for us this morning a contrast, right?
[2999.72 → 3004.36] Because things like resolutions and Christmas lists and gift exchange,
[3004.46 → 3007.46] things like Boxing Day that follows up, right?
[3007.48 → 3009.08] When you didn't get everything on your list,
[3009.14 → 3010.82] you're like, well, it's 70% off now,
[3010.88 → 3012.20] so I'm going to go get that new TV
[3012.20 → 3014.00] because my kid threw a chair at the one in the basement.
[3016.22 → 3017.30] There's a story there
[3017.30 → 3024.06] that implies something about what we think about life here and now,
[3024.06 → 3027.04] about what we have,
[3027.14 → 3028.08] about what we need,
[3028.32 → 3031.14] about what we believe we need to have.
[3032.52 → 3034.68] And into that context,
[3035.56 → 3036.32] Paul writes,
[3037.36 → 3042.16] praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[3042.16 → 3046.00] who has blessed us in the heavenly realms
[3046.00 → 3052.70] with every spiritual blessing.
[3052.70 → 3054.68] Now, first,
[3054.78 → 3056.78] he has blessed us.
[3057.46 → 3058.94] That's past tense.
[3059.24 → 3059.86] He has.
[3059.94 → 3060.86] It is done.
[3062.40 → 3067.60] And he has blessed us with every spiritual blessing.
[3069.50 → 3071.26] So, right at the outset,
[3071.68 → 3075.16] Paul is saying that you have everything you need
[3075.16 → 3076.46] for life and faith,
[3076.54 → 3078.58] for spirituality and relationship to God.
[3078.66 → 3081.38] He has already given that to you.
[3081.38 → 3084.80] There's no more need for lists or gifts or resolutions.
[3084.80 → 3087.66] No need to look for that one more thing,
[3087.82 → 3088.76] that secret thing,
[3088.88 → 3089.62] that extra thing,
[3089.70 → 3090.64] that special thing,
[3090.94 → 3091.10] right?
[3091.22 → 3092.08] What you need,
[3092.18 → 3092.80] you've got.
[3093.48 → 3094.74] It's already here.
[3095.08 → 3097.00] And the Bible tells us that by grace,
[3097.22 → 3098.08] through faith,
[3098.46 → 3100.58] you have received it already
[3100.58 → 3102.40] if you believe.
[3107.04 → 3107.64] But,
[3108.32 → 3110.94] so often,
[3111.94 → 3113.56] we forget.
[3114.84 → 3115.70] So often,
[3115.80 → 3117.00] we don't feel it.
[3117.08 → 3118.30] We don't live it.
[3118.38 → 3120.38] We don't really believe it
[3120.38 → 3121.40] to be true.
[3121.68 → 3121.96] And look,
[3121.96 → 3125.24] I'm not trying to shame anyone here
[3125.24 → 3126.94] who has doubts,
[3126.94 → 3128.24] right?
[3128.24 → 3130.88] And I'm not trying to say that there's something wrong with you
[3130.88 → 3132.00] if you don't feel it.
[3132.04 → 3132.36] At least,
[3132.50 → 3133.76] there's not anything wrong with you
[3133.76 → 3135.40] that isn't wrong with all of us,
[3135.44 → 3135.62] right?
[3135.62 → 3136.42] Because the truth is,
[3136.58 → 3137.68] we all have doubts.
[3137.84 → 3138.38] We all have struggles
[3138.94 → 3140.22] when it comes to faith.
[3140.32 → 3142.36] We all have short memories
[3142.36 → 3146.16] when it comes to our new creation identities.
[3146.16 → 3149.58] We all have competing loves
[3149.58 → 3153.50] that want to captivate our heart's affection.
[3155.78 → 3162.38] The human heart has a religious impulse,
[3163.60 → 3163.70] right?
[3163.72 → 3168.44] A religious sense that is inescapable and unavoidable.
[3169.70 → 3170.88] The reality is,
[3170.98 → 3173.16] if it isn't given proper expression
[3173.16 → 3177.66] or proper object to land on,
[3178.10 → 3179.90] your life,
[3180.90 → 3182.40] something in your life,
[3182.56 → 3184.90] will rush in to fill that void.
[3186.44 → 3187.72] Now, in today's world,
[3188.00 → 3189.68] maybe it has become politics,
[3190.58 → 3190.74] right?
[3190.74 → 3192.14] As we look to leaders
[3192.14 → 3194.74] to make decisions for us on our behalf.
[3194.82 → 3198.50] But maybe it is personal power or status.
[3198.78 → 3199.94] Maybe it's stuff.
[3199.94 → 3203.36] Maybe it's sex or pornography.
[3204.46 → 3206.04] Maybe it's work, right?
[3206.12 → 3209.04] And the status that comes with accomplishing something.
[3209.16 → 3210.22] Maybe it's education.
[3211.10 → 3212.08] Point is,
[3212.30 → 3215.42] whenever we remove the object
[3215.42 → 3217.42] of our religious affections
[3217.42 → 3219.98] from the one whom it is properly directed,
[3220.16 → 3221.30] that is the one true God,
[3221.44 → 3223.66] Father, incarnate Son, and Holy Spirit,
[3224.18 → 3226.54] whenever we remove our religious affections
[3226.54 → 3227.94] from God,
[3227.94 → 3229.36] they don't just disappear.
[3230.48 → 3231.94] They become misdirected.
[3232.78 → 3235.24] They become inappropriately filled.
[3236.90 → 3240.24] Your life is that you love something
[3240.24 → 3242.22] or someone as ultimate.
[3242.98 → 3244.94] That's just how you are built.
[3246.46 → 3249.78] And when the object of your ultimate religious affection
[3249.78 → 3253.18] isn't God revealed in Jesus Christ,
[3253.18 → 3255.88] whatever you make it
[3255.88 → 3258.48] can't handle the weight
[3258.48 → 3260.22] that you are putting on it.
[3261.22 → 3263.74] It itself will be destroyed
[3263.74 → 3265.20] by your need
[3265.20 → 3266.54] for it to be ultimate
[3266.54 → 3268.18] in your heart and life.
[3268.24 → 3269.02] Let me illustrate this.
[3269.10 → 3269.70] Think practically
[3269.70 → 3270.94] with me.
[3271.94 → 3274.18] If you make your spouse
[3274.18 → 3275.42] ultimate,
[3275.82 → 3278.48] or if you make getting a spouse
[3278.48 → 3279.32] ultimate,
[3279.54 → 3280.26] getting married
[3280.26 → 3281.02] ultimate,
[3281.02 → 3282.96] you will crush that person
[3282.96 → 3284.80] under the weight of glory
[3284.80 → 3286.58] that you are trying to put on them.
[3288.16 → 3289.76] The same is true with your family.
[3290.16 → 3291.94] If you think having a family
[3291.94 → 3292.82] or if you think
[3292.82 → 3295.08] reconciling your broken family
[3295.08 → 3297.00] will finally fill you up,
[3298.00 → 3300.26] you will crush your kids
[3300.26 → 3302.08] with the weight of responsibility
[3302.08 → 3303.98] that you are putting on them.
[3305.50 → 3307.08] And we do it with our jobs.
[3307.30 → 3308.46] We do it with beauty,
[3308.46 → 3309.66] with our talents,
[3309.78 → 3309.92] right?
[3309.96 → 3311.20] We make good things,
[3311.28 → 3312.40] we take these good things,
[3312.56 → 3313.54] and we make them
[3313.54 → 3314.84] into ultimate things.
[3315.06 → 3316.36] And not only will they
[3316.36 → 3317.40] disappoint us
[3317.40 → 3318.22] time and time again,
[3318.34 → 3319.88] they will crush us
[3319.88 → 3321.42] and those around us
[3321.42 → 3322.28] with the weight
[3322.28 → 3323.12] of responsibility
[3323.12 → 3324.18] that they weren't
[3324.18 → 3325.24] created to handle.
[3329.74 → 3331.04] And even as you hear me
[3331.04 → 3331.74] say that,
[3332.22 → 3333.14] some of you are going,
[3333.60 → 3334.48] yeah, I know that.
[3334.48 → 3337.40] Some of you are going,
[3338.90 → 3340.98] I needed to be reminded of that.
[3341.58 → 3343.20] Because we forget it, right?
[3343.24 → 3344.48] Despite knowing better,
[3344.74 → 3345.48] we do it anyway.
[3346.26 → 3347.44] And so we need
[3347.44 → 3348.48] a regular reminder.
[3349.48 → 3350.72] We need to regularly,
[3351.16 → 3352.48] habitually, ritually
[3353.16 → 3354.88] recalibrate
[3354.88 → 3356.38] our religious impulse.
[3356.58 → 3357.48] We need to pull
[3358.12 → 3359.64] our heart's attention
[3359.64 → 3361.72] back to the right object
[3361.72 → 3362.48] of our worship.
[3362.48 → 3363.12] worship.
[3363.50 → 3364.92] Only God can handle
[3364.92 → 3365.82] the weight of your
[3365.82 → 3366.92] religious affection.
[3368.18 → 3369.54] Only God is the right
[3369.54 → 3372.70] focus of your heart's
[3372.70 → 3373.38] attention.
[3375.02 → 3376.54] And each week in worship,
[3377.12 → 3378.66] that's what we are doing.
[3380.24 → 3380.44] Right?
[3380.52 → 3381.46] Each week at church,
[3381.60 → 3383.02] we remind ourselves
[3383.02 → 3384.40] of these truths,
[3384.58 → 3385.46] and we go through
[3385.46 → 3387.18] the habitual and ritual
[3387.18 → 3388.54] forming practices
[3388.54 → 3390.28] of being made new,
[3390.40 → 3391.40] of locating our
[3391.40 → 3392.40] religious affections
[3392.40 → 3394.14] on the right being.
[3395.10 → 3396.04] This first Sunday
[3396.04 → 3396.78] of the new year
[3396.78 → 3398.78] is exactly that.
[3399.00 → 3399.18] Right?
[3399.22 → 3400.68] We are being reminded
[3400.68 → 3401.64] by God
[3401.64 → 3402.72] of who we are
[3402.72 → 3403.30] in Him
[3403.30 → 3404.44] and who He has
[3404.44 → 3405.84] declared us to be.
[3407.56 → 3408.32] And let me be
[3408.32 → 3409.12] really clear.
[3410.24 → 3410.42] Right?
[3410.54 → 3411.74] Hearing it once
[3411.74 → 3413.54] isn't enough
[3413.54 → 3414.34] to sustain you
[3414.34 → 3414.86] for the year.
[3414.86 → 3417.46] So if you're the kind
[3417.46 → 3417.78] of person
[3417.78 → 3418.38] who is checking
[3418.38 → 3419.16] the church box
[3419.16 → 3419.96] on the first Sunday
[3419.96 → 3420.48] available,
[3420.80 → 3421.34] and you think
[3421.34 → 3422.04] that's enough,
[3423.32 → 3423.88] I'm sorry,
[3424.54 → 3425.10] it's not.
[3426.06 → 3427.22] We need to immerse
[3427.22 → 3428.76] ourselves in these
[3428.76 → 3429.56] truths because
[3429.56 → 3430.86] the reality is
[3430.86 → 3431.56] we live
[3431.56 → 3432.26] immersed
[3432.26 → 3433.42] in competing
[3433.42 → 3434.26] affections.
[3435.74 → 3436.44] And so,
[3436.58 → 3437.48] while this is a great
[3437.48 → 3438.58] way to start the year,
[3439.38 → 3441.14] it can't be the only time
[3441.14 → 3442.46] you hear it this year,
[3442.50 → 3443.44] or even this month.
[3443.44 → 3446.98] Praise be to the God
[3446.98 → 3447.38] and Father
[3447.38 → 3448.60] of our Lord Jesus Christ
[3448.60 → 3449.74] who has blessed us
[3449.74 → 3451.04] in the heavenly realms
[3451.04 → 3452.28] with every spiritual
[3452.28 → 3453.96] blessing in Christ.
[3454.12 → 3454.72] And so,
[3455.62 → 3457.04] what are those
[3457.04 → 3457.94] blessings?
[3460.06 → 3460.94] Knowing the answer
[3460.94 → 3461.82] to that question
[3461.82 → 3463.18] is how we will answer
[3463.18 → 3464.32] our bigger question
[3464.32 → 3464.80] this morning,
[3465.32 → 3467.18] who am I?
[3469.42 → 3470.64] The answer to the question
[3470.64 → 3471.32] who am I
[3471.32 → 3472.94] from Ephesians 1 here
[3472.94 → 3473.72] is this.
[3473.88 → 3474.96] Our identity
[3474.96 → 3476.06] in Jesus
[3476.06 → 3478.14] means that you are
[3478.14 → 3479.10] adopted,
[3480.32 → 3480.88] redeemed,
[3481.54 → 3482.88] you are given a purpose
[3482.88 → 3484.30] in God's plan,
[3484.72 → 3486.04] you are made into
[3486.04 → 3487.32] true and real
[3487.32 → 3488.22] worshippers,
[3488.38 → 3489.86] and you are filled
[3489.86 → 3492.02] with God's power.
[3493.24 → 3493.44] And so,
[3493.52 → 3494.28] quickly this morning,
[3494.50 → 3495.80] I have five points
[3495.80 → 3496.20] for you.
[3497.80 → 3499.16] Let's start with the first.
[3500.20 → 3500.88] You are
[3500.88 → 3502.10] adopted.
[3502.10 → 3505.48] He chose us
[3505.48 → 3506.28] in Him
[3506.28 → 3508.38] before the creation
[3508.38 → 3509.08] of the world
[3509.08 → 3510.22] to be holy
[3510.22 → 3511.06] and blameless
[3511.06 → 3511.88] in His sight.
[3512.32 → 3512.90] In love,
[3513.04 → 3514.42] He predestined us
[3514.42 → 3515.60] for adoption
[3515.60 → 3517.00] to son ship
[3517.00 → 3519.78] through Jesus Christ.
[3522.26 → 3522.98] Now,
[3523.02 → 3523.82] I sometimes think
[3523.82 → 3525.10] we lose
[3525.10 → 3526.04] the majesty
[3526.04 → 3528.10] of this truth.
[3528.10 → 3530.56] before there was
[3530.56 → 3531.24] anything,
[3532.24 → 3533.46] before God said,
[3533.68 → 3534.38] let there be light
[3534.38 → 3535.16] and then bang,
[3535.26 → 3536.56] there was light.
[3537.20 → 3538.26] Before God said,
[3538.64 → 3539.64] let the waters
[3539.64 → 3540.42] come together
[3540.42 → 3541.06] and the land
[3541.06 → 3542.22] be separated out.
[3542.52 → 3543.42] Before God said,
[3543.52 → 3544.60] let there be animals
[3544.60 → 3545.62] to walk on the land
[3545.62 → 3546.50] and birds to fly
[3546.50 → 3546.94] in the air.
[3547.02 → 3547.96] Before God said,
[3548.04 → 3549.24] let there be man
[3549.24 → 3549.80] and woman
[3549.80 → 3551.16] in my image.
[3551.22 → 3551.44] And so,
[3551.48 → 3552.14] in the image of God,
[3552.20 → 3553.06] He created them,
[3553.12 → 3553.78] male and female,
[3553.88 → 3554.46] He created them.
[3554.46 → 3556.02] Before any of that,
[3558.54 → 3559.10] God,
[3559.86 → 3560.78] Father,
[3561.00 → 3561.22] Son,
[3561.34 → 3562.10] and Holy Spirit
[3562.10 → 3563.04] in perfect harmony
[3563.04 → 3564.12] with each other
[3564.12 → 3565.82] thought
[3565.82 → 3567.54] of you.
[3569.98 → 3571.16] God thinks
[3571.16 → 3572.90] of you
[3572.90 → 3574.92] before the foundation
[3574.92 → 3575.60] of the world.
[3576.60 → 3577.60] And it's more than
[3577.60 → 3578.80] just to save you,
[3579.04 → 3579.16] right?
[3579.18 → 3579.72] It's more than just
[3579.72 → 3580.92] to call you to His own.
[3581.02 → 3582.54] It's to sanctify you.
[3582.62 → 3583.72] It is to grow you
[3583.72 → 3584.36] in Him
[3584.36 → 3585.16] to be,
[3585.32 → 3586.44] what we read,
[3586.54 → 3588.18] holy and blameless
[3588.18 → 3589.62] in His sight.
[3590.72 → 3591.88] God thought about
[3591.88 → 3593.46] your beginning in Him
[3593.46 → 3595.12] and you're continuing
[3595.12 → 3596.12] in Him.
[3596.20 → 3597.22] In theological terms,
[3597.32 → 3598.08] this is justification
[3598.08 → 3599.44] and sanctification.
[3599.70 → 3600.40] This is the start
[3600.40 → 3601.40] to the finish.
[3601.78 → 3602.66] There is now
[3602.66 → 3603.74] no time
[3603.74 → 3604.46] when God
[3604.46 → 3605.68] is not with you,
[3606.06 → 3606.82] working you,
[3606.98 → 3607.94] working in you,
[3608.04 → 3609.64] and working for you,
[3609.90 → 3611.96] and working through you
[3611.96 → 3613.12] to the world.
[3614.42 → 3615.24] Surely I am with you
[3615.24 → 3616.12] always to the very
[3616.12 → 3617.56] end of the age,
[3617.80 → 3618.40] says Jesus.
[3618.54 → 3619.92] There is no time
[3619.92 → 3620.64] when God
[3620.64 → 3622.12] is not with you,
[3622.20 → 3622.80] when God,
[3623.12 → 3623.86] who is love,
[3623.94 → 3625.38] is not thinking
[3625.38 → 3626.26] of you.
[3626.38 → 3627.76] You are adopted.
[3629.10 → 3630.36] You are a son.
[3631.68 → 3632.62] You are a daughter
[3632.62 → 3635.68] of God.
[3635.68 → 3637.18] You are adopted,
[3637.18 → 3643.36] you are redeemed.
[3645.20 → 3646.10] In Him,
[3646.46 → 3647.40] we have redemption
[3647.40 → 3648.50] through His blood,
[3649.12 → 3650.16] the forgiveness of sins,
[3650.32 → 3650.74] in accordance
[3650.74 → 3651.44] with the riches
[3651.44 → 3652.56] of God's grace
[3652.56 → 3654.28] that He lavished
[3654.28 → 3656.32] on us.
[3658.00 → 3659.60] I love that word,
[3660.00 → 3660.86] lavished.
[3662.28 → 3662.68] That word,
[3662.80 → 3663.66] in my mind and heart,
[3663.74 → 3664.56] just sings.
[3664.56 → 3666.04] It is plentiful,
[3666.16 → 3666.96] it is abundant,
[3667.18 → 3668.88] it is extravagant.
[3669.16 → 3669.80] So how do you
[3669.80 → 3671.40] experience God's grace
[3671.40 → 3673.98] as lavish today?
[3676.36 → 3677.54] We have received
[3677.54 → 3678.80] redemption
[3678.80 → 3680.82] through His blood.
[3680.88 → 3680.98] Now,
[3681.08 → 3681.96] the word redemption
[3681.96 → 3685.58] means to take out from.
[3686.74 → 3687.10] In fact,
[3687.14 → 3687.70] if you think of
[3687.70 → 3689.14] a redemption centre,
[3689.60 → 3689.82] right,
[3689.82 → 3690.88] you bring something there
[3690.88 → 3691.66] to take it out
[3691.66 → 3692.84] of circulation,
[3693.10 → 3693.28] right,
[3693.30 → 3694.56] to make a change
[3694.56 → 3695.54] of where it is.
[3696.44 → 3696.70] And so,
[3696.84 → 3697.42] this morning,
[3697.52 → 3698.78] how do you experience
[3698.78 → 3700.70] lavish redemption?
[3702.74 → 3703.64] I want to suggest
[3703.64 → 3704.78] a quick way
[3704.78 → 3706.24] to remember
[3706.24 → 3707.24] that,
[3707.96 → 3708.20] right,
[3708.24 → 3708.74] to experience
[3708.74 → 3709.78] lavish redemption.
[3710.04 → 3711.70] You are fully forgiven,
[3712.06 → 3713.32] you are freely forgiven,
[3713.32 → 3715.02] and you are forever forgiven.
[3715.02 → 3717.66] So you are fully forgiven.
[3717.86 → 3720.02] In Romans 8,
[3720.08 → 3720.56] verse 1,
[3721.30 → 3721.84] we read,
[3722.18 → 3722.78] there is now
[3722.78 → 3723.98] no condemnation
[3723.98 → 3724.94] for those who are
[3724.94 → 3726.58] in Christ Jesus.
[3727.86 → 3729.56] There is no condemnation.
[3730.20 → 3731.66] He has paid it all.
[3732.56 → 3733.84] All of your sins,
[3735.52 → 3735.80] gone.
[3737.46 → 3737.64] Right,
[3737.68 → 3738.64] you have no sin,
[3738.78 → 3739.10] past,
[3739.42 → 3739.64] present,
[3739.70 → 3740.20] or future,
[3740.38 → 3741.64] that has more power
[3741.64 → 3743.14] than the cross of Christ.
[3743.14 → 3743.22] past.
[3744.60 → 3745.26] And here's
[3745.26 → 3746.12] what that means.
[3746.96 → 3747.56] It means that
[3747.56 → 3748.50] your salvation
[3748.50 → 3749.52] was not just
[3749.52 → 3750.72] a past thing,
[3750.94 → 3751.74] it means that
[3751.74 → 3752.42] your salvation
[3752.42 → 3753.86] is a continuing
[3753.86 → 3755.72] now to save you
[3755.72 → 3756.44] thing.
[3757.74 → 3758.52] But so often,
[3758.88 → 3759.20] we say,
[3759.28 → 3760.10] but not me,
[3760.70 → 3760.82] right,
[3760.84 → 3762.16] not that sin,
[3762.24 → 3763.24] not that thing
[3763.24 → 3764.58] that nobody knows about,
[3764.66 → 3765.54] that secret thing,
[3765.76 → 3765.88] right,
[3765.92 → 3766.80] you just don't know,
[3766.80 → 3767.14] pastor,
[3767.24 → 3768.46] how bad it has been.
[3771.18 → 3772.08] Even there,
[3772.08 → 3773.54] you are fully
[3773.54 → 3774.90] forgiven.
[3776.40 → 3777.56] And you are freely
[3777.56 → 3778.32] forgiven.
[3778.40 → 3778.88] And what we mean there
[3778.88 → 3779.58] is that you cannot
[3779.58 → 3781.16] earn the forgiveness
[3781.16 → 3781.86] of God.
[3781.96 → 3782.74] Ephesians 2,
[3782.88 → 3783.66] 8 and 9,
[3783.78 → 3785.18] for it is by grace
[3785.18 → 3787.46] you have been saved.
[3788.18 → 3789.60] And this is not by works,
[3789.84 → 3790.68] but it is the gift
[3790.68 → 3791.16] of God.
[3792.72 → 3792.90] Now,
[3792.92 → 3793.50] in the midst of
[3793.50 → 3795.14] this free offer
[3795.14 → 3796.18] of forgiveness
[3796.18 → 3796.98] and grace
[3796.98 → 3798.42] in our world
[3798.42 → 3799.12] and in our culture
[3799.12 → 3800.02] and in our hearts,
[3800.54 → 3802.10] we so often say
[3802.10 → 3803.60] nothing worth having
[3803.60 → 3804.44] is free.
[3806.18 → 3806.60] Right?
[3806.62 → 3807.46] If I don't earn it,
[3807.62 → 3808.78] if I don't work for it,
[3808.92 → 3810.00] if I don't bend over
[3810.00 → 3810.76] backwards in order
[3810.76 → 3811.20] to get it,
[3811.30 → 3812.26] it's not real.
[3815.58 → 3816.44] And yes,
[3817.44 → 3818.32] hear the gospel,
[3819.34 → 3820.44] this grace
[3820.44 → 3821.86] is free
[3821.86 → 3822.94] to you.
[3824.08 → 3825.00] Make no mistake
[3825.00 → 3825.42] about it,
[3825.44 → 3826.12] it costs
[3826.12 → 3826.82] God
[3826.82 → 3827.92] everything.
[3829.50 → 3830.18] It's free
[3830.18 → 3830.68] to you,
[3830.78 → 3831.18] but it's
[3831.18 → 3831.82] not
[3831.82 → 3832.78] cheap.
[3835.36 → 3836.12] You are
[3836.12 → 3836.60] fully
[3836.60 → 3837.24] forgiven,
[3837.38 → 3837.60] you are
[3837.60 → 3838.02] freely
[3838.02 → 3838.50] forgiven,
[3838.66 → 3839.36] and you are
[3839.36 → 3840.10] forever
[3840.10 → 3841.10] forgiven.
[3842.54 → 3843.06] Hebrews
[3843.06 → 3844.12] says,
[3844.48 → 3845.50] Christ died
[3845.50 → 3846.06] once
[3846.06 → 3847.20] for all.
[3848.24 → 3848.88] The altar
[3848.88 → 3849.60] is closed.
[3849.96 → 3850.54] You've got
[3850.54 → 3851.20] nothing more
[3851.20 → 3852.46] to lay on it.
[3852.54 → 3853.04] There's nothing
[3853.04 → 3853.40] left.
[3853.52 → 3853.90] It is
[3853.90 → 3855.00] already
[3855.00 → 3856.04] paid for.
[3856.14 → 3856.40] It is
[3856.40 → 3856.92] all
[3856.92 → 3857.52] already
[3857.52 → 3858.54] paid for.
[3860.48 → 3861.16] But here's
[3861.16 → 3861.56] the struggle
[3861.56 → 3862.14] that so many
[3862.14 → 3862.56] of us
[3862.56 → 3863.42] who are
[3863.42 → 3863.86] familiar
[3863.86 → 3864.72] with this
[3864.72 → 3865.26] and yet
[3865.26 → 3865.88] who continue
[3865.88 → 3866.96] to live
[3866.96 → 3867.46] in the midst
[3867.46 → 3867.88] of this
[3867.88 → 3869.24] hard truth
[3869.24 → 3869.98] and reality,
[3870.20 → 3870.86] so many
[3870.86 → 3871.46] of us
[3871.46 → 3872.54] try to
[3872.54 → 3873.56] stay
[3873.56 → 3874.36] forgiven.
[3876.64 → 3877.24] And you
[3877.24 → 3877.80] hear the
[3877.80 → 3879.16] oxymoron
[3879.16 → 3879.38] there,
[3879.46 → 3879.66] right?
[3879.70 → 3880.06] For those
[3880.06 → 3880.40] of us
[3880.40 → 3880.90] who are
[3880.90 → 3881.78] fully
[3881.78 → 3882.12] forgiven,
[3882.28 → 3882.48] freely
[3882.48 → 3882.86] forgiven,
[3883.02 → 3883.30] forever
[3883.30 → 3883.68] forgiven,
[3883.68 → 3884.08] the idea
[3884.08 → 3884.32] of trying
[3884.32 → 3884.98] to stay
[3884.98 → 3885.52] forgiven
[3885.52 → 3887.06] sounds strange,
[3887.20 → 3887.92] but we
[3887.92 → 3888.46] continue to
[3888.46 → 3888.74] do it,
[3888.78 → 3888.86] right?
[3888.90 → 3889.08] And what
[3889.08 → 3889.52] that means
[3889.52 → 3890.88] is that we
[3890.88 → 3892.18] set up these
[3892.18 → 3893.78] impossible moral
[3893.78 → 3894.88] standards for
[3894.88 → 3895.74] ourselves and
[3895.74 → 3896.78] then we destroy
[3896.78 → 3898.96] ourselves emotionally
[3898.96 → 3899.66] and spiritually
[3899.66 → 3900.66] when we sin
[3900.66 → 3901.40] or when we fall
[3901.40 → 3901.80] short.
[3901.94 → 3902.68] And we think
[3902.68 → 3903.24] that it means
[3903.24 → 3903.86] that we haven't
[3903.86 → 3904.56] then received
[3904.56 → 3905.28] the redemption
[3905.28 → 3905.98] through his
[3905.98 → 3906.32] blood.
[3907.70 → 3908.38] But here's
[3908.38 → 3908.98] what happens,
[3909.76 → 3910.22] and I want you
[3910.22 → 3910.88] to listen closely
[3910.88 → 3911.46] to this because
[3911.46 → 3911.86] this is going
[3911.86 → 3912.30] to hit home
[3912.30 → 3912.64] for some
[3912.64 → 3912.98] of you,
[3913.72 → 3914.06] especially
[3914.06 → 3914.48] for those
[3914.48 → 3914.76] of you who
[3914.76 → 3914.98] have been
[3914.98 → 3915.40] around the
[3915.40 → 3915.82] church for
[3915.82 → 3916.08] a really
[3916.08 → 3916.66] long time,
[3917.24 → 3917.38] right?
[3917.42 → 3917.80] In that
[3917.80 → 3918.50] fight in
[3918.50 → 3919.04] our hearts
[3919.04 → 3920.06] to stay
[3920.06 → 3920.68] forgiven,
[3921.26 → 3922.16] the fight
[3922.16 → 3923.00] that motivates
[3923.00 → 3924.02] us to make
[3924.02 → 3925.18] these impossibly
[3925.18 → 3925.88] high moral
[3925.88 → 3926.62] standards for
[3926.62 → 3927.28] ourselves,
[3928.72 → 3929.24] right,
[3929.32 → 3929.76] what that means
[3929.76 → 3930.58] is we don't
[3930.58 → 3931.36] give ourselves
[3931.36 → 3931.96] grace or we
[3931.96 → 3932.66] don't let the
[3932.66 → 3933.16] grace of God
[3933.16 → 3933.70] fill us up,
[3933.84 → 3934.64] that fight
[3934.64 → 3935.66] is hard and
[3935.66 → 3936.34] it is long
[3936.34 → 3936.98] and it is
[3936.98 → 3937.46] work and
[3937.46 → 3938.16] honestly it's
[3938.16 → 3938.96] too much work
[3938.96 → 3939.60] to keep up.
[3939.86 → 3940.48] It is impossible
[3940.48 → 3941.18] for us to do.
[3941.18 → 3941.78] And so,
[3941.90 → 3942.20] what do we
[3942.20 → 3942.48] do?
[3943.10 → 3943.76] Instead of
[3943.76 → 3944.30] turning back
[3944.30 → 3945.00] to the gospel
[3945.00 → 3945.78] that tells me
[3945.78 → 3946.48] I am freely,
[3946.94 → 3948.36] fully forgiven
[3948.36 → 3949.94] and forever
[3949.94 → 3950.44] forgiven,
[3950.86 → 3951.78] that Jesus has
[3951.78 → 3952.12] done it,
[3952.18 → 3952.52] instead of
[3952.52 → 3953.24] turning back
[3953.24 → 3954.42] to that gospel,
[3955.12 → 3955.62] what we do
[3955.62 → 3956.30] is we start
[3956.30 → 3957.20] pushing our
[3957.20 → 3957.94] moralisms,
[3958.06 → 3958.38] we start
[3958.38 → 3958.92] pushing our
[3958.92 → 3959.46] legalisms,
[3959.60 → 3960.28] our high
[3960.28 → 3960.96] standards of
[3960.96 → 3961.64] morality out
[3961.64 → 3962.00] on other
[3962.00 → 3962.48] people.
[3963.94 → 3964.56] And what
[3964.56 → 3965.24] started as an
[3965.24 → 3966.28] impossible standard
[3966.28 → 3967.30] for ourselves
[3967.30 → 3968.46] becomes the
[3968.46 → 3969.52] impossible standard
[3969.52 → 3970.54] by which we
[3970.54 → 3971.42] look at other
[3971.42 → 3972.70] people because
[3972.70 → 3973.86] it's easier to
[3973.86 → 3974.86] judge them
[3974.86 → 3976.42] than to admit
[3976.42 → 3977.04] the truth about
[3977.04 → 3978.58] myself to
[3978.58 → 3979.06] myself.
[3980.64 → 3981.76] We blind
[3981.76 → 3982.64] ourselves to
[3982.64 → 3983.36] our need,
[3983.50 → 3984.24] to our sin,
[3984.46 → 3985.44] by highlighting
[3985.44 → 3986.14] the sin of
[3986.14 → 3986.48] others.
[3987.26 → 3988.28] We judge
[3988.28 → 3989.00] others so that
[3989.00 → 3989.62] we can feel
[3989.62 → 3990.40] better about
[3990.40 → 3990.74] our own
[3990.74 → 3991.18] garbage.
[3992.52 → 3993.16] At least I'm
[3993.16 → 3993.84] not that bad.
[3994.80 → 3995.40] At least I
[3995.40 → 3995.94] didn't cheat.
[3997.02 → 3997.54] At least I
[3997.54 → 3997.82] don't,
[3998.82 → 3999.18] whatever,
[3999.74 → 4000.14] fill in your
[4000.14 → 4000.44] blank.
[4001.44 → 4002.28] Instead of
[4002.28 → 4003.04] God's word
[4003.04 → 4003.52] being the
[4003.52 → 4003.88] truth by
[4003.88 → 4004.24] which we
[4004.24 → 4004.78] see and
[4004.78 → 4005.10] measure
[4005.10 → 4005.90] ourselves,
[4006.08 → 4006.60] we turn
[4006.60 → 4007.04] to these
[4007.04 → 4007.98] self-judgments
[4007.98 → 4008.70] and we turn
[4008.70 → 4009.04] them into
[4009.04 → 4010.40] weapons against
[4010.40 → 4011.00] others.
[4013.50 → 4014.20] And the
[4014.20 → 4014.64] world has
[4014.64 → 4015.12] noticed.
[4016.48 → 4017.26] If the
[4017.26 → 4018.10] world judges
[4018.10 → 4019.16] Christians as
[4019.16 → 4020.10] judgmental,
[4020.34 → 4021.36] as holier than
[4021.36 → 4022.36] now, it's
[4022.36 → 4023.36] because we
[4023.36 → 4023.80] have done
[4023.80 → 4024.10] this.
[4024.22 → 4024.44] We've
[4024.44 → 4024.94] blinded
[4024.94 → 4026.02] ourselves to
[4026.02 → 4026.42] our own
[4026.42 → 4026.90] hearts and
[4026.90 → 4027.48] our own
[4027.48 → 4028.34] needs and
[4028.34 → 4028.62] we've just
[4028.62 → 4029.14] projected it
[4029.14 → 4029.70] onto others
[4029.70 → 4031.28] because it's
[4031.28 → 4032.54] easier to
[4032.54 → 4033.00] not deal
[4033.00 → 4033.54] with me.
[4035.94 → 4036.58] Instead,
[4037.58 → 4038.64] you have
[4038.64 → 4039.46] been blessed
[4039.46 → 4040.60] with every
[4040.60 → 4041.78] spiritual
[4041.78 → 4042.80] blessing.
[4043.84 → 4044.42] You have
[4044.42 → 4045.32] been redeemed.
[4045.70 → 4046.10] You have
[4046.10 → 4046.84] redemption
[4046.84 → 4047.70] which he
[4047.70 → 4049.10] lavished on
[4049.10 → 4049.38] you.
[4050.64 → 4051.40] How did
[4051.40 → 4051.70] he does
[4051.70 → 4052.06] that?
[4052.96 → 4053.48] He did
[4053.48 → 4053.72] it by
[4053.72 → 4054.14] Jesus
[4054.14 → 4054.74] living the
[4054.74 → 4055.14] life that
[4055.14 → 4055.52] you should
[4055.52 → 4056.04] have lived
[4056.04 → 4057.50] and by
[4057.50 → 4058.20] dying the
[4058.20 → 4058.88] death that
[4058.88 → 4059.56] you deserved.
[4060.00 → 4060.92] Jesus did
[4060.92 → 4061.70] what I
[4061.70 → 4062.54] can't.
[4062.78 → 4063.28] He lived
[4063.28 → 4064.38] perfectly and
[4064.38 → 4065.18] he gives
[4065.18 → 4065.70] that to
[4065.70 → 4065.94] me.
[4066.02 → 4066.96] His perfect
[4066.96 → 4067.70] righteousness
[4067.70 → 4068.82] he freely
[4068.82 → 4069.46] gives.
[4069.60 → 4070.68] Jesus died
[4070.68 → 4071.26] what I
[4071.26 → 4072.00] deserve.
[4072.22 → 4072.74] On the
[4072.74 → 4073.36] cross he
[4073.36 → 4074.02] took my
[4074.02 → 4075.04] punishment for
[4075.04 → 4075.56] sin, for
[4075.56 → 4076.64] your sin.
[4076.82 → 4077.32] That's the
[4077.32 → 4077.78] gospel.
[4078.32 → 4079.12] Short and
[4079.12 → 4079.40] sweet.
[4079.78 → 4080.16] Simple.
[4080.58 → 4081.20] Jesus did
[4081.20 → 4081.92] what I can't
[4081.92 → 4082.48] and Jesus
[4082.48 → 4083.06] died what
[4083.06 → 4083.70] I deserve.
[4085.28 → 4085.86] And because
[4085.86 → 4086.52] of that
[4086.52 → 4088.90] you, even
[4088.90 → 4092.56] you, can
[4092.56 → 4093.22] be fully
[4093.22 → 4094.22] forgiven.
[4094.74 → 4095.36] Freely
[4095.36 → 4096.46] forgiven and
[4096.46 → 4097.18] forever
[4097.18 → 4098.34] forgiven.
[4099.90 → 4100.48] Here just a
[4100.48 → 4101.32] quick application
[4101.32 → 4101.92] before I move
[4101.92 → 4102.06] on.
[4103.26 → 4104.14] How can
[4104.14 → 4104.90] you know
[4104.90 → 4106.48] that you
[4106.48 → 4107.56] are fully,
[4107.98 → 4108.28] freely,
[4108.60 → 4109.00] forever
[4109.00 → 4109.82] forgiven?
[4109.82 → 4112.88] Now here's
[4112.88 → 4113.24] what Jesus
[4113.24 → 4114.64] taught when
[4114.64 → 4114.94] he taught
[4114.94 → 4115.42] his disciples
[4115.42 → 4115.90] to pray.
[4116.10 → 4116.22] And
[4116.22 → 4117.04] providence of
[4117.04 → 4117.56] God, Eric,
[4117.66 → 4118.02] you starting
[4118.02 → 4118.42] your prayer
[4118.42 → 4118.92] that way was
[4118.92 → 4119.40] perfect.
[4121.62 → 4121.94] Jesus
[4121.94 → 4122.60] prays,
[4123.44 → 4124.12] forgive us
[4124.12 → 4124.92] our sins.
[4125.54 → 4125.86] What's the
[4125.86 → 4126.24] next line?
[4131.92 → 4132.44] As,
[4132.64 → 4134.74] as we
[4134.74 → 4135.52] forgive those
[4135.52 → 4135.98] who sinned
[4135.98 → 4136.60] against us.
[4136.98 → 4137.56] Did you hear
[4137.56 → 4137.86] that?
[4138.70 → 4139.48] As you
[4139.48 → 4140.00] forgive those
[4140.00 → 4140.56] again, one
[4140.56 → 4140.94] of the
[4140.94 → 4141.56] marks that
[4141.56 → 4142.18] you are
[4142.18 → 4142.92] forgiven,
[4143.52 → 4144.32] right, and
[4144.32 → 4144.72] this is from
[4144.72 → 4145.66] Jesus himself,
[4146.30 → 4146.86] one of the
[4146.86 → 4147.32] marks that
[4147.32 → 4147.72] you are
[4147.72 → 4148.76] forgiven is
[4148.76 → 4149.28] that you
[4149.28 → 4150.16] are forgiving.
[4152.50 → 4153.38] And so,
[4153.98 → 4154.92] who do you
[4154.92 → 4155.52] need to
[4155.52 → 4156.64] fully forgive,
[4157.08 → 4158.06] freely forgive,
[4158.52 → 4159.30] and forever
[4159.30 → 4160.38] forgive?
[4162.42 → 4163.20] I'm serving
[4163.20 → 4163.74] that up to you.
[4163.74 → 4164.22] You can think
[4164.22 → 4164.70] on that over
[4164.70 → 4165.00] the next
[4165.00 → 4165.48] couple days.
[4165.48 → 4166.48] God's
[4166.48 → 4167.48] will.
[4167.48 → 4167.64] We are
[4167.64 → 4168.10] adopted,
[4168.94 → 4169.42] we are
[4169.42 → 4169.94] redeemed,
[4170.34 → 4170.86] we are
[4170.86 → 4171.48] given a
[4171.48 → 4172.50] purpose in
[4172.50 → 4173.32] God's
[4173.32 → 4174.00] will.
[4176.00 → 4176.88] He made
[4176.88 → 4177.36] known to
[4177.36 → 4177.88] us the
[4177.88 → 4178.56] mystery of
[4178.56 → 4179.08] his will
[4179.08 → 4179.68] according to
[4179.68 → 4180.06] his good
[4180.06 → 4180.38] pleasure,
[4180.64 → 4181.30] which he
[4181.30 → 4182.16] purposed
[4182.16 → 4183.82] in Christ,
[4184.30 → 4184.76] to be put
[4184.76 → 4185.40] into effect
[4185.40 → 4185.86] when the
[4185.86 → 4186.46] times reach
[4186.46 → 4186.62] their
[4186.62 → 4187.00] fulfillment,
[4187.42 → 4187.82] to bring
[4187.82 → 4188.62] unity to
[4188.62 → 4189.80] all things
[4189.80 → 4190.26] in heaven
[4190.26 → 4191.02] and on
[4191.02 → 4192.22] earth under
[4192.22 → 4193.24] Christ.
[4197.30 → 4197.94] God's
[4197.94 → 4199.82] will, can
[4199.82 → 4200.20] be
[4200.20 → 4200.86] mysterious,
[4201.74 → 4202.98] and God's
[4202.98 → 4203.92] plan can
[4203.92 → 4206.46] be weird
[4206.46 → 4207.58] and strange,
[4207.72 → 4209.10] and to be
[4209.10 → 4209.84] honest, and
[4209.84 → 4210.84] to be truthful
[4210.84 → 4211.46] here, you
[4211.46 → 4212.44] can question
[4212.44 → 4212.76] it.
[4213.34 → 4214.22] God invites
[4214.22 → 4215.04] your questions
[4215.04 → 4216.14] as you
[4216.14 → 4216.88] struggle through
[4216.88 → 4218.04] the day-to-day
[4218.04 → 4218.84] things of
[4218.84 → 4219.20] life.
[4220.02 → 4220.74] But even
[4220.74 → 4221.54] as you ask
[4221.54 → 4222.40] those questions,
[4222.84 → 4223.70] also know
[4223.70 → 4224.28] that God
[4224.28 → 4225.18] does indeed
[4225.18 → 4225.78] have a
[4225.78 → 4226.18] plan.
[4227.28 → 4227.60] And that
[4227.60 → 4228.22] plan not
[4228.22 → 4229.44] only includes
[4229.44 → 4230.40] you, right,
[4230.44 → 4231.30] God's plan
[4231.30 → 4231.98] is made
[4231.98 → 4232.76] known to
[4232.76 → 4233.04] you.
[4234.04 → 4234.42] In the
[4234.42 → 4234.92] end, there
[4234.92 → 4235.44] is no
[4235.44 → 4236.36] surprise for
[4236.36 → 4236.90] the Christian
[4236.90 → 4237.74] man or
[4237.74 → 4238.90] woman about
[4238.90 → 4239.52] what God
[4239.52 → 4240.02] is doing
[4240.02 → 4240.36] in the
[4240.36 → 4240.62] world.
[4241.18 → 4241.70] God has
[4241.70 → 4242.44] a plan to
[4242.44 → 4243.38] bring all
[4243.38 → 4243.90] things in
[4243.90 → 4244.40] heaven and
[4244.40 → 4244.70] on earth
[4244.70 → 4245.40] together under
[4245.40 → 4246.08] one head,
[4246.68 → 4246.98] Christ.
[4250.28 → 4251.02] God has
[4251.02 → 4252.88] a plan and
[4252.88 → 4253.30] God is
[4253.30 → 4254.44] sovereign over
[4254.44 → 4255.50] that plan and
[4255.50 → 4256.08] that means
[4256.08 → 4257.00] that everything
[4257.00 → 4257.86] that happens,
[4258.92 → 4261.22] everything is
[4261.22 → 4261.92] accounted for
[4261.92 → 4262.40] in God's
[4262.40 → 4262.66] plan.
[4264.16 → 4265.68] Now, some
[4265.68 → 4266.08] of you don't
[4266.08 → 4266.46] like that
[4266.46 → 4266.78] idea.
[4267.82 → 4268.34] Some of you
[4268.34 → 4268.86] think that
[4268.86 → 4269.22] that makes
[4269.22 → 4269.74] God out to
[4269.74 → 4270.42] be a tyrant
[4270.42 → 4271.44] or malevolent,
[4271.84 → 4272.00] right?
[4272.04 → 4272.66] If God has
[4272.66 → 4273.26] a plan, if
[4273.26 → 4273.72] God was
[4273.72 → 4274.58] sovereign, if
[4274.58 → 4275.04] God really
[4275.04 → 4276.32] loved me or
[4276.32 → 4277.14] loved her or
[4277.14 → 4277.66] loved him,
[4277.88 → 4278.30] he wouldn't
[4278.30 → 4278.66] have let
[4278.66 → 4279.34] cancer come.
[4279.34 → 4280.70] Grandma wouldn't
[4280.70 → 4281.26] have died.
[4281.50 → 4281.98] I wouldn't
[4281.98 → 4282.42] have lost
[4282.42 → 4283.00] my job.
[4286.20 → 4286.54] Now, if you
[4286.54 → 4287.00] try to
[4287.00 → 4288.94] suggest that
[4288.94 → 4290.06] things happen
[4290.06 → 4291.68] outside
[4291.68 → 4292.48] the will of
[4292.48 → 4294.58] God, your
[4294.58 → 4295.38] God isn't
[4295.38 → 4296.12] big enough to
[4296.12 → 4296.62] be God.
[4297.98 → 4298.46] Right?
[4298.48 → 4298.94] If you want
[4298.94 → 4299.52] a God who
[4299.52 → 4300.40] is big enough
[4300.40 → 4301.52] to be angry
[4301.52 → 4302.42] at when things
[4302.42 → 4303.54] go wrong, you
[4303.54 → 4304.42] also have to
[4304.42 → 4305.22] accept a God
[4305.22 → 4306.10] who is sovereign
[4306.10 → 4306.70] enough, who
[4306.70 → 4307.52] is God
[4307.52 → 4308.72] enough, who
[4308.72 → 4309.66] is big enough
[4309.66 → 4310.48] to have
[4310.48 → 4312.00] reasons that
[4312.00 → 4312.56] you can't
[4312.56 → 4313.90] understand, to
[4313.90 → 4314.68] have a purpose
[4314.68 → 4315.64] for you needing
[4315.64 → 4316.70] to endure this,
[4317.08 → 4317.54] that, or the
[4317.54 → 4318.22] other thing, things
[4318.22 → 4319.06] that appear wrong
[4319.06 → 4320.54] or unjust, God
[4320.54 → 4321.12] has a plan.
[4323.20 → 4324.00] The book of
[4324.00 → 4324.62] Job in the
[4324.62 → 4325.16] Old Testament
[4325.16 → 4326.36] deals with this
[4326.36 → 4327.16] entire question,
[4327.28 → 4328.00] and right at the
[4328.00 → 4329.70] very beginning, Job
[4329.70 → 4330.54] asks a question.
[4330.64 → 4331.18] In chapter 2,
[4331.24 → 4331.78] verse 10, he
[4331.78 → 4332.52] says, shall we
[4332.52 → 4333.76] accept only good
[4333.76 → 4334.92] from God and
[4334.92 → 4335.82] not trouble?
[4335.82 → 4338.50] So, at the
[4338.50 → 4339.12] beginning of this
[4339.12 → 4340.42] new year, right,
[4340.48 → 4341.48] after this past
[4341.48 → 4342.04] year, which we're
[4342.04 → 4342.72] all quite content
[4342.72 → 4343.56] to leave in the
[4343.56 → 4345.02] past, is your
[4345.02 → 4346.66] conception of God
[4346.66 → 4347.88] big enough to
[4347.88 → 4349.16] include the
[4349.16 → 4349.80] things that we
[4349.80 → 4350.78] can't or that we
[4350.78 → 4351.54] don't even want
[4351.54 → 4352.82] to understand?
[4353.90 → 4354.72] Because that's
[4354.72 → 4355.70] what it means to
[4355.70 → 4356.30] be given a
[4356.30 → 4358.14] purpose in God's
[4358.14 → 4360.58] will, that he
[4360.58 → 4362.14] has a plan for
[4362.14 → 4363.40] you, a purpose
[4363.40 → 4364.24] for you.
[4364.24 → 4365.10] And right here,
[4365.48 → 4366.24] right now, he
[4366.24 → 4367.36] is working that
[4367.36 → 4368.20] out.
[4370.48 → 4371.44] Who am I?
[4372.92 → 4373.44] Adopted,
[4374.02 → 4374.44] redeemed,
[4374.88 → 4375.72] given a purpose
[4375.72 → 4376.82] and a plan in
[4376.82 → 4377.76] God's will, and
[4377.76 → 4379.48] for you are a
[4379.48 → 4381.14] true worshipper.
[4385.94 → 4386.94] In him we were
[4386.94 → 4387.94] also chosen, having
[4387.94 → 4388.72] been predestined
[4388.72 → 4389.34] according to the
[4389.34 → 4390.10] plan of him who
[4390.10 → 4390.96] works out everything
[4390.96 → 4392.40] in conformity with
[4392.40 → 4393.18] the purpose of his
[4393.18 → 4394.18] will, verse 12,
[4394.24 → 4395.82] in order that we,
[4396.50 → 4396.92] who were the
[4396.92 → 4397.78] first to put our
[4397.78 → 4398.66] hope in Christ,
[4399.08 → 4400.14] might be for the
[4400.14 → 4401.56] praise of his
[4401.56 → 4402.58] glory.
[4403.88 → 4405.36] For the praise
[4405.36 → 4406.66] of his
[4406.66 → 4407.78] glory.
[4408.62 → 4410.24] God chose you,
[4410.42 → 4411.72] he predestined
[4411.72 → 4412.82] you, he adopted
[4412.82 → 4414.22] you, he planned
[4414.22 → 4415.56] for you before the
[4415.56 → 4416.58] foundation of the
[4416.58 → 4417.88] world in order
[4417.88 → 4418.82] that for the
[4418.82 → 4419.86] purpose of, so
[4419.86 → 4421.34] that you might be
[4421.34 → 4422.72] for the praise of
[4422.72 → 4424.28] his glory, so
[4424.28 → 4425.26] that you might be
[4425.26 → 4426.48] a true
[4426.48 → 4427.26] worshipper.
[4428.78 → 4429.46] There is nothing
[4429.46 → 4430.78] bigger or
[4430.78 → 4432.38] better than the
[4432.38 → 4433.78] glory of
[4433.78 → 4434.54] God.
[4435.46 → 4435.66] Right?
[4435.80 → 4437.00] God who is
[4437.00 → 4438.72] all in all, is
[4438.72 → 4440.02] most magnificent,
[4440.26 → 4440.98] is most
[4440.98 → 4442.02] marvellous, is
[4442.02 → 4442.94] most amazing,
[4443.14 → 4443.84] most worthy
[4443.84 → 4444.60] of praise.
[4444.68 → 4445.58] He is most
[4445.58 → 4446.30] awesome.
[4446.42 → 4447.14] There is none
[4447.14 → 4447.54] greater.
[4447.72 → 4448.70] He alone is
[4448.70 → 4449.40] worthy of all
[4449.40 → 4450.56] glory and honour
[4450.56 → 4451.32] and praise.
[4451.48 → 4452.26] He is the
[4452.26 → 4453.46] most beautiful.
[4453.66 → 4454.30] There is no
[4454.30 → 4455.88] being better or
[4455.88 → 4457.08] more worthy of my
[4457.08 → 4458.28] love and affection
[4458.28 → 4460.06] and he is big
[4460.06 → 4461.24] enough, he alone
[4461.24 → 4462.56] is big enough, to
[4462.56 → 4463.76] handle the weight
[4463.76 → 4464.96] of my ultimate
[4464.96 → 4465.72] affections.
[4466.70 → 4467.76] That's who God
[4467.76 → 4468.14] is.
[4469.38 → 4470.32] That means
[4470.32 → 4471.42] something for whom
[4471.42 → 4472.30] you are in
[4472.30 → 4473.00] him.
[4474.24 → 4475.60] I really like the
[4475.60 → 4476.56] way the Westminster
[4476.56 → 4477.88] Shorter Confession
[4477.88 → 4478.34] puts it.
[4479.02 → 4479.38] You've probably
[4479.38 → 4479.86] heard me say
[4479.86 → 4480.42] this before.
[4480.50 → 4480.90] It asks the
[4480.90 → 4481.94] question, what
[4481.94 → 4482.86] is the chief
[4482.86 → 4483.78] end of
[4483.78 → 4484.76] humanity?
[4485.44 → 4486.08] Why are you
[4486.08 → 4486.36] here?
[4487.00 → 4487.52] Why were you
[4487.52 → 4487.90] created?
[4488.00 → 4488.34] What is your
[4488.34 → 4489.30] purpose, your
[4489.30 → 4490.08] tells?
[4490.46 → 4491.56] The answer, to
[4491.56 → 4493.24] glorify God and
[4493.24 → 4494.50] enjoy him
[4494.50 → 4495.48] forever.
[4496.08 → 4497.44] To glorify God
[4497.44 → 4498.24] and enjoy him
[4498.24 → 4499.42] forever in order
[4499.42 → 4500.68] that we might be
[4500.68 → 4502.36] for the praise of
[4502.36 → 4503.90] his glory.
[4505.78 → 4507.24] John Piper is a
[4507.24 → 4507.82] pastor and
[4507.82 → 4508.38] theologian.
[4508.38 → 4510.40] he has a line,
[4510.50 → 4511.00] a quote that
[4511.00 → 4512.70] says, God is
[4512.70 → 4514.12] most glorified in
[4514.12 → 4515.74] us when we are
[4515.74 → 4517.86] most satisfied in
[4517.86 → 4518.18] him.
[4519.76 → 4521.80] You glorify God by
[4521.80 → 4522.96] making him your
[4522.96 → 4524.56] all in all.
[4525.38 → 4526.20] That's real
[4526.20 → 4526.62] worship.
[4527.64 → 4528.28] That's what this
[4528.28 → 4528.80] is about.
[4529.14 → 4530.00] Here, right here
[4530.00 → 4530.94] we get a taste.
[4531.36 → 4532.32] Next week at the
[4532.32 → 4533.12] Lord's Supper where
[4533.12 → 4534.00] we gather together,
[4534.20 → 4534.84] we're going to get
[4534.84 → 4535.50] even more of a
[4535.50 → 4535.84] taste.
[4535.84 → 4537.70] This is supposed
[4537.70 → 4538.88] to be a place
[4538.88 → 4539.74] where you can
[4539.74 → 4540.58] encounter the
[4540.58 → 4541.64] living God in a
[4541.64 → 4542.34] way that you can
[4542.34 → 4544.00] see and hear and
[4544.00 → 4545.20] taste and know.
[4545.52 → 4546.40] That's what real
[4546.40 → 4547.48] worship is about.
[4548.52 → 4550.10] And you are made
[4550.10 → 4551.56] to be a real
[4551.56 → 4552.46] worshipper.
[4552.46 → 4559.14] I'm going to
[4559.14 → 4559.84] offend some of you
[4559.84 → 4560.26] right now.
[4561.58 → 4562.50] I just want to
[4562.50 → 4562.90] warn you.
[4563.34 → 4563.86] Trigger warning.
[4565.22 → 4565.96] You were created,
[4566.14 → 4566.90] redeemed, adopted,
[4567.00 → 4567.76] and chosen before the
[4567.76 → 4568.48] foundation of the
[4568.48 → 4569.88] world for the
[4569.88 → 4570.50] praise of his
[4570.50 → 4570.86] glory.
[4571.36 → 4572.00] You have been
[4572.00 → 4572.62] blessed with an
[4572.62 → 4573.42] opportunity to
[4573.42 → 4574.40] worship God in
[4574.40 → 4575.38] spirit and in
[4575.38 → 4576.44] truth to come into
[4576.44 → 4577.74] this space and
[4577.74 → 4579.10] witness Jesus coming
[4579.10 → 4579.64] to you.
[4579.64 → 4581.10] And sometimes
[4581.10 → 4583.76] your attitude
[4583.76 → 4585.26] sucks.
[4588.60 → 4589.40] Let me be clear,
[4589.46 → 4589.94] I'm preaching to
[4589.94 → 4591.04] myself as well.
[4592.56 → 4593.44] When you come to
[4593.44 → 4594.40] church on Sunday
[4594.40 → 4596.06] and the first thing
[4596.06 → 4596.70] out of your mouth
[4596.70 → 4597.50] or the first thought
[4597.50 → 4598.02] in your head,
[4598.28 → 4599.00] the first feeling
[4599.00 → 4599.90] in your heart is a
[4599.90 → 4600.74] grumbling about
[4600.74 → 4601.60] something you don't
[4601.60 → 4601.94] like.
[4602.72 → 4603.50] I don't like the
[4603.50 → 4604.12] way that stage
[4604.12 → 4604.44] looks.
[4605.08 → 4605.94] I don't like being
[4605.94 → 4606.56] told to wear a
[4606.56 → 4606.90] mask.
[4607.50 → 4608.22] I don't like this
[4608.22 → 4608.58] band.
[4608.58 → 4610.00] I don't like that
[4610.00 → 4610.40] song.
[4611.20 → 4611.88] I don't like that
[4611.88 → 4612.20] preacher.
[4613.62 → 4614.66] When you come here
[4614.66 → 4615.44] grumbling and
[4615.44 → 4616.40] complaining and
[4616.40 → 4617.28] your heart attitude
[4617.28 → 4619.70] sucks, you are
[4619.70 → 4621.74] denying yourself the
[4621.74 → 4623.16] very purpose for
[4623.16 → 4623.80] which you have been
[4623.80 → 4624.20] adopted.
[4624.96 → 4626.04] The praise and
[4626.04 → 4627.16] glory of God.
[4627.74 → 4628.64] And your selfish
[4628.64 → 4630.02] attitude is stopping
[4630.02 → 4631.18] you from that
[4631.18 → 4631.54] purpose.
[4633.20 → 4634.10] Here's what I know.
[4634.38 → 4635.14] For some of you,
[4635.26 → 4636.36] for probably most of
[4636.36 → 4637.14] you, if statistics
[4637.14 → 4637.96] bear it out, no, you
[4637.96 → 4638.60] guys are better than
[4638.60 → 4639.48] statistics, so maybe
[4639.48 → 4640.22] there's a few more.
[4641.00 → 4642.10] But for most of you,
[4642.26 → 4643.94] this here and now,
[4644.02 → 4644.96] this hour, hour and
[4644.96 → 4645.84] a half, depending on
[4645.84 → 4647.36] how things go, is the
[4647.36 → 4648.74] only time of the week
[4648.74 → 4649.38] where you will open
[4649.38 → 4649.84] your Bible.
[4651.02 → 4652.22] The only chance you
[4652.22 → 4653.52] have to give yourself
[4653.52 → 4655.00] to hear God, to talk
[4655.00 → 4656.44] to God, to listen for
[4656.44 → 4656.90] his leading.
[4658.30 → 4659.46] And for some of you,
[4659.72 → 4660.64] right, this is the only
[4660.64 → 4661.68] chance that you have
[4661.68 → 4662.92] to gather with
[4662.92 → 4664.88] Christians until next
[4664.88 → 4666.48] week when we do it
[4666.48 → 4666.82] again.
[4668.36 → 4669.58] Don't take that for
[4669.58 → 4670.08] granted.
[4671.56 → 4672.80] Don't come, whether in
[4672.80 → 4674.46] person or online, with
[4674.46 → 4675.86] grumbling hearts.
[4676.12 → 4677.44] Yes, come authentically.
[4677.78 → 4678.56] Come as you are.
[4678.68 → 4680.26] Bring everything you have
[4680.26 → 4682.08] into this space, even if
[4682.08 → 4683.38] that's your anger, even if
[4683.38 → 4684.18] that's your disappointment,
[4684.54 → 4686.02] even if that's your rage at
[4686.02 → 4687.28] everything that's going on.
[4688.04 → 4690.12] But come ready to meet
[4690.12 → 4690.90] God.
[4691.48 → 4693.60] Come expecting that God has
[4693.60 → 4695.40] something for you in this
[4695.40 → 4696.20] time together.
[4696.60 → 4697.88] Don't come grumbling and
[4697.88 → 4699.20] putting up walls that are
[4699.20 → 4699.78] going to make it even
[4699.78 → 4701.22] harder to hear the voice of
[4701.22 → 4702.22] Jesus in our gathering.
[4705.42 → 4706.44] Do you do that for the
[4706.44 → 4706.84] next year?
[4710.20 → 4711.28] You are adopted.
[4712.28 → 4713.46] You are redeemed.
[4713.88 → 4715.22] You are given a purpose in
[4715.22 → 4716.36] the plan of God, and you
[4716.36 → 4717.92] are a real worshipper.
[4717.92 → 4719.84] And then fifth, finally, you
[4719.84 → 4722.98] are filled with God's
[4722.98 → 4723.70] power.
[4726.44 → 4728.86] When you believed, you
[4728.86 → 4730.42] were marked in him with a
[4730.42 → 4732.24] seal, the promised Holy
[4732.24 → 4734.08] Spirit, who is a deposit
[4734.08 → 4735.66] guaranteeing our inheritance
[4735.66 → 4737.38] until the redemption of
[4737.38 → 4738.54] those who are God's
[4738.54 → 4741.36] possessions to the praise of
[4741.36 → 4742.92] his glory.
[4742.92 → 4747.06] Lastly, most importantly,
[4747.26 → 4750.66] perhaps, you are filled with
[4750.66 → 4752.50] the Holy Spirit.
[4753.74 → 4755.00] Okay, the only way that you
[4755.00 → 4756.56] can be adopted, let alone
[4756.56 → 4757.70] know that you are adopted,
[4757.94 → 4759.46] the only way that you can be
[4759.46 → 4761.02] united to the redemption
[4761.02 → 4762.62] bought by his blood, the
[4762.62 → 4763.78] only way that you are given
[4763.78 → 4765.36] a purpose and a plan and
[4765.36 → 4766.38] that you can know that
[4766.38 → 4767.94] purpose, the only way that
[4767.94 → 4768.88] you can worship in the
[4768.88 → 4770.48] Spirit and in truth as a real
[4770.48 → 4772.58] worshipper is because of the
[4772.58 → 4773.38] Holy Spirit.
[4775.62 → 4777.26] Now, years ago, Francis
[4777.26 → 4778.82] Chan wrote a great little
[4778.82 → 4780.46] book called Forgotten God.
[4780.56 → 4782.16] The idea was that sometimes
[4782.16 → 4784.14] it is easy to overlook the
[4784.14 → 4785.82] role and power and presence
[4785.82 → 4788.54] of the Holy Spirit and his
[4788.54 → 4790.82] necessity for life and faith
[4790.82 → 4791.46] in Jesus.
[4792.38 → 4794.90] And I think, generally, in our
[4794.90 → 4797.32] tradition, we are guilty of
[4797.32 → 4797.70] the same.
[4798.88 → 4800.48] Now, let me be clear, okay?
[4800.54 → 4802.06] I'm not talking about special
[4802.06 → 4803.38] gifts or tongues or prophecy
[4803.38 → 4804.80] or healing, right?
[4804.80 → 4805.82] I'm not talking about
[4805.82 → 4807.52] everybody needing to be
[4807.52 → 4808.82] happy, crappy, or dancing
[4808.82 → 4810.48] in the aisles, slain in the
[4810.48 → 4811.36] Spirit, right?
[4811.38 → 4812.62] I am talking about the
[4812.62 → 4814.28] ordinary life and faith
[4814.28 → 4814.98] stuff.
[4815.12 → 4816.86] The Holy Spirit is necessary
[4816.86 → 4818.78] and required, an absolute
[4818.78 → 4820.76] must for all of that.
[4821.52 → 4822.72] How do I come to new
[4822.72 → 4823.10] belief?
[4823.94 → 4825.14] The work of the Holy Spirit.
[4825.38 → 4826.54] How do I come to renewed
[4826.54 → 4827.02] belief?
[4827.20 → 4828.30] The work of the Holy Spirit.
[4828.44 → 4829.94] How has my life changed for
[4829.94 → 4830.22] Jesus?
[4830.22 → 4831.16] The Holy Spirit.
[4831.28 → 4833.26] How do I endure testing or
[4833.26 → 4833.74] trial?
[4833.96 → 4834.74] The Holy Spirit.
[4835.28 → 4837.24] How does the Word of God
[4837.24 → 4839.00] become living and active in
[4839.00 → 4839.58] my life?
[4839.76 → 4840.72] The Holy Spirit.
[4841.50 → 4842.74] How is my prayer made
[4842.74 → 4844.34] effective in the will of God
[4844.34 → 4845.08] for the world?
[4845.40 → 4846.42] The Holy Spirit.
[4847.44 → 4849.66] How do I use my gifts to
[4849.66 → 4851.70] serve and edify the church?
[4852.88 → 4854.14] With the Holy Spirit.
[4855.40 → 4857.52] God promises to equip you with
[4857.52 → 4859.24] every spiritual blessing.
[4860.50 → 4864.04] That is the Holy Spirit.
[4866.68 → 4868.68] You can't do this on your own.
[4869.60 → 4871.04] You can't do it at all, in
[4871.04 → 4871.34] fact.
[4871.78 → 4874.04] But God gives you himself, the
[4874.04 → 4875.64] promised Holy Spirit, so that
[4875.64 → 4878.20] it is him doing it in you and
[4878.20 → 4879.64] with you and by your side.
[4880.98 → 4882.76] Philippians 2, Paul says,
[4883.16 → 4884.58] continue to work out your
[4884.58 → 4886.10] salvation with fear and
[4886.10 → 4887.44] trembling, so hear that, continue
[4887.44 → 4889.34] to do this work, for it is
[4889.34 → 4891.74] God who works in you to will
[4891.74 → 4893.46] and to act in order to
[4893.46 → 4895.58] fulfill his good purposes.
[4897.18 → 4899.54] So maybe you've said, I don't
[4899.54 → 4900.48] know if I can do this.
[4901.24 → 4902.30] I don't know if I can handle
[4902.30 → 4902.76] this.
[4903.92 → 4904.90] Truth is, you can't.
[4905.98 → 4908.26] On your own, you can't.
[4909.58 → 4911.34] But you are not on your own
[4911.34 → 4913.32] because you are not your own.
[4913.32 → 4915.74] You were bought with a price.
[4916.24 → 4916.32] Right?
[4916.40 → 4918.08] God's Holy Spirit isn't just a
[4918.08 → 4920.02] companion enabling you to
[4920.02 → 4920.44] endure.
[4920.68 → 4922.16] The Holy Spirit in you and with
[4922.16 → 4923.94] you are a promise that you will
[4923.94 → 4924.62] endure.
[4924.94 → 4927.98] He is a deposit guaranteeing our
[4927.98 → 4928.86] inheritance.
[4933.56 → 4936.10] That's God's promise to you.
[4936.10 → 4941.28] I don't want to overstate the
[4941.28 → 4941.56] case.
[4942.84 → 4943.90] So I'll put it this way.
[4944.38 → 4945.88] The second most important
[4945.88 → 4948.54] question anyone will ever ask
[4948.54 → 4950.18] is, who am I?
[4951.94 → 4952.88] Now you're wondering what the
[4952.88 → 4954.48] first most important question is.
[4954.54 → 4955.44] Well, that's who is Jesus?
[4956.34 → 4957.50] But the answers are intimately
[4957.50 → 4957.92] related.
[4959.58 → 4960.44] Who am I?
[4960.44 → 4966.48] Today and every day, you are
[4966.48 → 4970.14] adopted sons and daughters, God.
[4970.88 → 4974.74] You are redeemed by his lavish
[4974.74 → 4975.50] love.
[4976.26 → 4978.22] You are given a purpose and a
[4978.22 → 4980.20] plan in his sovereign power.
[4980.38 → 4983.10] You are a real worshipper of the
[4983.10 → 4983.88] one true God.
[4984.02 → 4986.06] And you have the power of that
[4986.06 → 4988.80] God himself inside of you.
[4988.80 → 4992.20] No matter what 2022 brings,
[4992.84 → 4994.80] nothing can change that.
[4996.74 → 5000.16] But imagine how much you would
[5000.16 → 5002.80] be changed if you remembered this
[5002.80 → 5003.68] truth all year long.
[5004.76 → 5005.80] Let me pray for you.
[5009.54 → 5016.00] Lord Jesus, speak the truth of our
[5016.00 → 5019.46] identity in you and from you over
[5019.46 → 5022.18] each of us this morning.
[5024.66 → 5027.80] Give us new eyes to see and to be
[5027.80 → 5031.52] encouraged and to go in your power.
[5033.44 → 5036.00] And God, for those of us here this
[5036.00 → 5038.00] morning or hearing this morning,
[5038.84 → 5041.12] for whom this is new, or this is the
[5041.12 → 5042.82] first time we're wondering about our
[5042.82 → 5045.94] identity in Jesus, I pray, Holy Spirit,
[5046.12 → 5048.06] break down walls of hostility.
[5048.22 → 5050.36] I pray, Holy Spirit, transform hearts
[5050.36 → 5051.90] of stone into hearts of flesh.
[5052.22 → 5053.64] I pray, Holy Spirit, that our hearts
[5053.64 → 5056.64] might beat and course in love for you.
[5059.64 → 5063.24] Transform each one of us
[5063.24 → 5065.50] into the image of your Son.
[5065.50 → 5069.40] That we might know ourselves as adopted
[5069.40 → 5072.08] and redeemed, as part of your plan,
[5072.82 → 5075.54] as true worshippers, and as filled
[5075.54 → 5077.68] with your power.
[5078.86 → 5082.22] Come what may, this truth remains.

[5321.08 → 5323.42] May God go behind you to guard you.
[5323.82 → 5326.40] May God go beneath you to support you.
[5326.72 → 5329.46] May God go beside you to befriend you.
