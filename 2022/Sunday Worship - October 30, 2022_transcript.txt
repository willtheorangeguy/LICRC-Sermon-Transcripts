[0.48 --> 1.00]  Amen.
[2.92 --> 6.26]  So the first song is God So Loved from We the Kingdom,
[6.48 --> 8.14]  if you want to check it out on your phone.
[12.44 --> 14.20]  Never mind, we're on.
[14.20 --> 14.82]  Woo-hoo!
[14.82 --> 30.42]  Come all you weary, come all you thirsty,
[30.42 --> 34.74]  come to the well, we're there on Christ.
[35.14 --> 39.56]  Sing not the water, come all you thirst alone.
[39.56 --> 47.98]  Come all you sinners, come find His mercy,
[48.38 --> 52.12]  come to the table He will satisfy.
[52.84 --> 58.24]  Praise God His goodness, find what you're looking for.
[61.30 --> 66.02]  For God so loved the world that He gave us,
[66.02 --> 70.46]  His one and only Son to save us.
[70.46 --> 76.68]  Whoever believes in Him will live for the world.
[79.02 --> 83.58]  Come on and pray, God, bring your redemption.
[84.10 --> 87.96]  Come, pray the ground at the front of the cross.
[88.50 --> 93.88]  Jesus is waiting there with love and heart.
[93.88 --> 95.88]  Be the kingdom of God.
[95.88 --> 96.20]  Amen.
[96.20 --> 97.28]  Amen.
[97.28 --> 101.76]  For God so loved the world that He gave us,
[101.84 --> 106.18]  His one and only Son to save us.
[106.18 --> 111.88]  Whoever believes in Him will live for the world.
[112.38 --> 113.02]  Amen.
[113.02 --> 113.48]  Amen.
[114.56 --> 119.14]  The power of hell forever defeated.
[119.14 --> 137.40]  When the heaven is full.
[137.40 --> 145.38]  Amen.
[145.38 --> 149.96]  For the wondrous heart is alone
[149.96 --> 154.42]  Praise God, praise God
[154.42 --> 158.64]  From all our blessings alone
[158.64 --> 162.38]  Praise Him, praise Him
[163.00 --> 168.38]  For the wondrous heart is alone
[168.38 --> 172.22]  From God's soul, love
[172.22 --> 176.72]  The world that He gave us is one and only
[176.72 --> 181.00]  Son to save for God so long
[181.00 --> 185.62]  The world that He gave us is one and only
[185.62 --> 187.82]  Son to save us
[187.82 --> 192.98]  Whoever believes in Him will live forever
[192.98 --> 200.60]  The power of hell forever with me
[200.60 --> 202.84]  Now it is well
[202.84 --> 205.10]  I'm walking in freedom
[205.10 --> 207.18]  For God's soul, love
[207.18 --> 210.82]  God's soul of the world
[210.82 --> 216.54]  Bring all your failures
[216.54 --> 218.60]  Bring your addictions
[218.60 --> 220.64]  Come lay them down
[220.64 --> 222.88]  And the blood of the cross
[222.88 --> 225.14]  Jesus is waiting
[225.14 --> 229.14]  God's soul of the world
[229.14 --> 235.12]  God's soul of the road
[235.12 --> 241.58]  Like the Mullet of the world
[241.58 --> 246.70]  From God's soul, love
[246.70 --> 247.64]  For woíz we live forever
[247.64 --> 251.36]  This land of the world
[251.36 --> 277.86]  Our Father, everlasting, we are created right, God Almighty.
[281.36 --> 291.30]  Through your Holy Spirit, conceived in Christ the Son, Jesus our Savior.
[293.42 --> 307.02]  I believe in God our Father, I believe in Christ the Son, I believe in the Holy Spirit, our God is free in one.
[307.02 --> 319.14]  I believe in the resurrection, and He will rise again, for I believe in the name of Jesus.
[319.14 --> 331.14]  I believe in the Holy Spirit, His Son, I believe in the Holy Spirit, His Son, I believe in the Holy Spirit, His Son, He will rise again, for His Son.
[331.14 --> 353.14]  I judge the Lord, His Son, He will rise again, for His Son, He will rise again, for His Son, He will rise again, for His Son.
[353.14 --> 357.14]  I believe in the name of Jesus.
[357.14 --> 383.12]  I believe in the Holy Spirit, His Son, He will rise again, for I believe in the name of Jesus.
[383.12 --> 405.12]  I believe in the Holy Spirit, His Son, He will rise again, for His Son, He will rise again, for His Son, He will rise again, for His Son.
[405.12 --> 407.12]  I believe in the name of Jesus.
[407.12 --> 435.10]  I believe in the Holy Spirit, His Son, He will rise again, for His Son, He will rise again, for His Son, He will rise again, for His Son, He will rise again, for His Son.
[435.10 --> 437.10]  I believe in the Holy Spirit, His Son, He will rise again again, for His Son.
[437.10 --> 439.10]  I believe in the Holy Spirit, His Son, He will rise again again, for His Son, He will rise again again.
[439.10 --> 445.10]  I believe in the saints' communion, and in the holy truth.
[445.90 --> 451.34]  I believe in the resurrection, and Jesus comes again.
[451.62 --> 456.78]  For I believe in the name of Jesus.
[457.78 --> 460.18]  I believe in God, O Father.
[460.70 --> 463.06]  I believe in Christ, O Son.
[463.06 --> 466.06]  I believe in the holy spirit.
[466.06 --> 474.90]  I believe in the resurrection, and we'll rise again.
[475.44 --> 480.36]  For I believe in the name of Jesus.
[481.08 --> 486.88]  For I believe in the name of Jesus.
[496.06 --> 507.10]  On Friday evening, and for most of yesterday, the women of this congregation had an opportunity to meet together.
[507.10 --> 514.98]  And to listen to and to share in the life stories of some of the women in this church.
[514.98 --> 526.52]  And they shared how the Lord wasn't just present in times of struggle and dismay and grief and sorrow, but that he carried them.
[527.42 --> 535.24]  He walked alongside them, and he put specific people right into their lives at just the right time.
[535.24 --> 541.38]  We talked about giving space to honor times of lament.
[543.38 --> 548.98]  And instead of feeling shame, to realize that there is real richness in our weaknesses.
[550.12 --> 558.84]  And so as we sing the next song, we can sing with confidence that our pain and sorrow is washed away in the waves of God's mercies.
[558.84 --> 588.82]  And so as we sing the next song, we sing the next song.
[588.82 --> 618.80]  We sing the next song.
[618.82 --> 624.42]  Come, Lord Jesus, come.
[627.30 --> 633.76]  Come, Lord Jesus, come.
[635.60 --> 646.36]  All who are thirsty, all who are weak, come to the fountain.
[646.36 --> 660.30]  Give your heart in the streams of life, let the pain and the sorrow be washed away.
[661.30 --> 675.30]  In the waves of the sea, as he cries out to thee, we say, Holy Spirit.
[676.36 --> 688.50]  Holy Spirit, come.
[688.50 --> 696.42]  Come, Lord Jesus, come.
[696.42 --> 705.56]  Come, Lord Jesus, come.
[705.56 --> 707.56]  Come, Lord Jesus, come.
[707.56 --> 709.70]  Come, Lord Jesus, come.
[709.70 --> 710.44]  Pray with me.
[713.74 --> 716.12]  Father, we come to you thirsty.
[717.28 --> 718.90]  Refresh us by your spirit.
[719.70 --> 720.64]  We come weak.
[721.92 --> 723.24]  Strengthen us with your spirit.
[724.28 --> 725.50]  We come weary.
[726.64 --> 728.24]  Help us to find rest in you.
[728.24 --> 732.82]  Father, we confess we need you.
[733.82 --> 735.54]  You who first loved us.
[736.88 --> 741.94]  Be our shelter, O Most High, for you are our refuge and our fortress.
[743.40 --> 746.74]  Help us put our trust in you and rest.
[747.50 --> 749.00]  Rest in you, Abba Father.
[750.44 --> 750.72]  Amen.
[750.72 --> 753.84]  We rise as we sing these last two songs.
[753.84 --> 783.82]  Lord, I am
[783.84 --> 787.56]  I am cast
[787.56 --> 790.02]  Now in here
[790.02 --> 793.78]  I find my rest
[793.78 --> 796.32]  Without you
[796.32 --> 800.06]  I fall apart
[800.06 --> 803.04]  You're the one
[803.04 --> 807.18]  Who guides my heart
[807.18 --> 813.82]  Lord, I need you
[813.82 --> 818.30]  Oh, I need you
[818.30 --> 821.04]  Every hour
[821.04 --> 823.82]  I need you
[824.54 --> 826.04]  My one
[826.04 --> 827.96]  It ends
[827.96 --> 829.82]  My righteousness
[830.50 --> 835.82]  Oh God, how I need you
[835.82 --> 846.92]  Your grace is born
[846.92 --> 850.04]  Your grace is done
[850.04 --> 853.42]  It's where you are
[853.42 --> 855.90]  And where you are
[855.90 --> 859.96]  Lord, I am free
[859.96 --> 861.42]  Holiness
[861.42 --> 865.42]  Is Christ in me
[865.42 --> 868.42]  And where you are
[868.42 --> 871.42]  Lord, I am free
[871.42 --> 874.42]  Holiness
[874.42 --> 878.90]  Is Christ in me
[878.90 --> 884.42]  Lord, I need you
[884.42 --> 885.52]  Lord, I need you
[885.52 --> 889.42]  Oh, I need you
[889.42 --> 892.80]  Every hour
[892.80 --> 895.42]  I need you
[895.42 --> 897.42]  My one
[897.42 --> 898.36]  I want you
[898.36 --> 901.64]  My righteousness
[901.64 --> 907.42]  Oh God, how I need you
[907.42 --> 913.64]  Teach my song to rise for you
[913.64 --> 916.52]  When temptation
[916.52 --> 916.54]  When temptation
[916.54 --> 918.86]  Loves my way
[918.86 --> 922.10]  When I cannot stand
[922.10 --> 924.02]  I'll follow you
[924.02 --> 929.64]  Jesus, you're my hope and save
[929.64 --> 933.12]  When I cannot stand
[933.12 --> 934.64]  I'll follow you
[934.64 --> 941.64]  Jesus, you're my hope and save
[941.64 --> 942.64]  Jesus, you're my hope and save
[942.64 --> 944.64]  Jesus, you're my hope and save
[944.64 --> 946.64]  Lord, I need you
[946.64 --> 947.64]  Lord, I need you
[947.64 --> 951.64]  Oh, I need you
[951.64 --> 954.64]  Every hour
[954.64 --> 956.64]  I need you
[956.64 --> 959.64]  My one
[959.64 --> 960.64]  I need you
[960.64 --> 962.64]  My righteousness
[962.64 --> 968.64]  Oh, God, how I need you
[968.64 --> 972.64]  Lord, I need you
[972.64 --> 976.64]  Lord, I need you
[976.64 --> 979.64]  Here we are
[979.64 --> 980.64]  Every hour
[980.64 --> 983.64]  I need you
[983.64 --> 985.64]  My one
[985.64 --> 986.64]  I need you
[986.64 --> 988.64]  Lord, I need you
[988.64 --> 989.64]  Here we are
[989.64 --> 991.64]  I need you
[991.64 --> 994.64]  My one
[994.64 --> 995.64]  I need you
[995.64 --> 998.64]  My one
[998.64 --> 999.64]  I need you
[999.64 --> 1029.62]  Thank you.
[1029.64 --> 1059.62]  Thank you.
[1059.64 --> 1061.64]  Thank you.
[1089.64 --> 1091.64]  Thank you.
[1119.64 --> 1121.64]  Thank you.
[1149.64 --> 1151.64]  Thank you.
[1179.64 --> 1181.64]  Thank you.
[1181.64 --> 1183.64]  Thank you.
[1183.64 --> 1185.64]  Thank you.
[1185.64 --> 1187.64]  Thank you.
[1187.64 --> 1189.64]  Thank you.
[1189.64 --> 1191.64]  Thank you.
[1191.64 --> 1193.64]  Thank you.
[1193.64 --> 1195.64]  Thank you.
[1195.64 --> 1197.64]  Thank you.
[1197.64 --> 1199.64]  Thank you.
[1199.64 --> 1201.64]  Thank you.
[1201.64 --> 1203.64]  Thank you.
[1203.64 --> 1205.64]  Thank you.
[1205.64 --> 1209.64]  Thank you.
[1209.64 --> 1211.64]  Thank you.
[1211.64 --> 1213.64]  Thank you.
[1213.64 --> 1215.64]  Oh,
[1215.64 --> 1235.58]  In nanoA
[1245.64 --> 1254.94]  Good morning. Today's offerings are for the regular church budget and also for the seafarers ministry.
[1255.60 --> 1260.36]  And with that, we've got Gary Roersma to tell us about it.
[1265.26 --> 1272.18]  Well, thank you and good morning. It's nice to be with you again. I see some familiar faces and it's good to be here.
[1272.18 --> 1279.88]  It's been a while since I think I spoke or preached here, but I know it was during my time, certainly as chaplain with the Ministry of Seafarers.
[1280.72 --> 1287.14]  It was quite a journey out here from Vancouver, the rain and everything. And it's raining, I think, even possible heavier in Vancouver.
[1288.56 --> 1293.34]  This past week, my wife and I celebrated two anniversaries.
[1294.14 --> 1299.32]  On Wednesday, we celebrated the anniversary of our engagement.
[1299.32 --> 1303.96]  How many of you remember the day that you were engaged, got engaged on?
[1304.52 --> 1311.16]  And then on Friday, actually, even more importantly, we, no, we didn't get married two days later.
[1311.28 --> 1311.98]  Don't, don't.
[1312.98 --> 1323.52]  On Friday, we celebrated with my wife the day she was not raised in a Christian home, very secular home, very secular atmosphere.
[1323.52 --> 1335.12]  But the day 45 years ago that she went down to the beach near Spanish banks with an old high school friend who had recently become a Christian himself.
[1335.42 --> 1338.32]  And she gave her life to the Lord Jesus 45 years ago.
[1338.82 --> 1345.02]  And so we biked down to Spanish banks to that area and nearby somewhere around in that region.
[1345.02 --> 1347.02]  And we reflected on that.
[1347.12 --> 1348.44]  So a very big day.
[1349.06 --> 1353.18]  But we sang earlier, I need thee, Lord.
[1353.30 --> 1354.06]  I need you.
[1354.16 --> 1355.26]  I need you, Lord.
[1355.82 --> 1363.90]  And I don't think we realize how difficult it is for people to say those words initially.
[1363.90 --> 1371.34]  Because my wife said her biggest resistance was not wanting to give up her independence.
[1372.20 --> 1375.36]  Not wanting to lean on someone else.
[1375.50 --> 1378.44]  Those are really difficult words to say for many people today.
[1379.44 --> 1387.68]  But when it comes to ships and seafarers, I can tell you they say those words a lot.
[1387.68 --> 1391.38]  I was just on a ship yesterday and I was talking with some of the guys.
[1391.52 --> 1394.06]  I said, so how they just come over from Asia.
[1394.40 --> 1395.38]  How was the journey?
[1395.78 --> 1397.56]  And they just went like this.
[1398.78 --> 1405.60]  And they said, and this is the season when things are getting really starting to get rough for seafarers.
[1406.14 --> 1409.58]  And they, you know, they experience those seas.
[1409.84 --> 1414.26]  And I tell you, I don't meet that many atheists on board ships.
[1414.26 --> 1417.30]  I'm not saying they're all committed followers of Jesus.
[1417.54 --> 1428.40]  But in terms of their sense of their own puniness, if I may say, and dependence, there is a real, real sense of that.
[1429.26 --> 1430.58]  Here's a picture of a ship.
[1430.74 --> 1435.88]  But a verse I often read when I'm with seafarers, among many others.
[1436.00 --> 1437.60]  But this one from Psalm 93.
[1438.26 --> 1439.96]  The floods have lifted up, O Lord.
[1440.02 --> 1441.96]  The floods have lifted up their voice.
[1441.96 --> 1445.16]  The floods have lifted up their roaring.
[1446.18 --> 1449.08]  Mightier than the thunders of many waters.
[1449.78 --> 1451.96]  Mightier than the waves of the sea.
[1452.32 --> 1455.24]  The Lord on high is mighty.
[1455.86 --> 1458.04]  And that's a good reminder for seafarers.
[1458.46 --> 1461.44]  Anyway, so we're still on ships regularly.
[1461.62 --> 1463.40]  This is a ship just recently heading out.
[1463.68 --> 1468.34]  I got the tugboat in the back heading out of the port of Vancouver to back out to sea,
[1468.46 --> 1469.96]  which they're going in and out constantly.
[1469.96 --> 1471.28]  Next slide.
[1472.48 --> 1475.40]  What we've been continuing to serve seafarers.
[1475.82 --> 1479.38]  COVID was through some, you know, hiccups into the whole thing.
[1479.46 --> 1481.62]  But we continue to go on board.
[1482.06 --> 1484.32]  And more and more are coming to the centers.
[1484.80 --> 1489.26]  One of the things we've been doing is helping with a lot of vaccinations.
[1489.26 --> 1491.46]  Because they couldn't get them elsewhere.
[1491.46 --> 1495.98]  And if they want to travel and get home even, they had to have those vaccinations for so long.
[1496.60 --> 1498.58]  So, and getting them their boosters and everything.
[1498.68 --> 1499.82]  So, we're still doing that.
[1499.94 --> 1500.98]  I was on a ship yesterday.
[1501.10 --> 1503.14]  They were just saying, can you help us arrange boosters?
[1503.28 --> 1504.46]  They said, yeah, we can do that.
[1504.52 --> 1505.20]  So, be in touch.
[1505.20 --> 1508.90]  So, we're doing a lot of this with seafarers.
[1509.00 --> 1513.10]  We've done over 3,000 seafarers just in British Columbia.
[1513.36 --> 1515.00]  It's pushing up to 4,000.
[1515.52 --> 1516.38]  Over 3,500.
[1517.02 --> 1525.06]  In all of North America, seafarers centers and others have helped with the vaccination of over 90,000 seafarers.
[1525.18 --> 1527.42]  So, it's been a big campaign of ours.
[1528.04 --> 1528.54]  Next slide.
[1529.40 --> 1531.34]  This is a guy coming into the center.
[1531.80 --> 1535.08]  As I said, ships are, you know, we've been going on board the ships.
[1535.38 --> 1538.24]  Now, ships are starting to give grant shore leave.
[1538.72 --> 1543.28]  And if they don't, like yesterday, I was on the ship and the guy said, no, we're not allowed.
[1543.62 --> 1546.14]  And I said, you need to take this document.
[1546.28 --> 1549.82]  And I bring it on board with me from Transport Canada that says,
[1549.90 --> 1555.68]  now Transport Canada is requiring ships to grant shore leave to their seafarers.
[1555.68 --> 1564.72]  And if they don't, if a port state inspector comes on board, they can site that ship for a deficiency, which is a major thing.
[1565.06 --> 1569.88]  And that's helping slowly to loosen up some of those ships.
[1569.98 --> 1578.08]  Well, this guy happened to be, he was, the strictest ships, as you can probably understand, are often those from China, the Chinese companies.
[1578.52 --> 1579.62]  But this guy was Chinese.
[1579.76 --> 1582.42]  And he was, they were, for some reason, able to come ashore.
[1582.42 --> 1587.06]  He was so excited, he got to the center and he said, I want my picture taken.
[1587.12 --> 1588.16]  This is the first time I've been off.
[1588.30 --> 1592.88]  You know, I was on the ship the other day and I got, we kept, one of those guys that got his vaccination.
[1593.46 --> 1599.42]  And we got to the center to get his vaccine and he opened the door and he put his foot outside and he stepped down.
[1599.48 --> 1604.18]  He said, this is the first time in six months that I've been on ground, on land, you know.
[1604.56 --> 1607.38]  And he said that he'd been able to get off the ship.
[1607.38 --> 1610.54]  And this guy, too, was so excited, he said, we have to take a picture, take a picture.
[1610.72 --> 1613.30]  He actually initiated it, so I got one with my phone, too.
[1613.42 --> 1613.84]  Next slide.
[1615.00 --> 1617.64]  This is recently a guy, well, this was over summer.
[1618.30 --> 1622.84]  Deepak was a guy who came in with, he was with one of the cruise ships.
[1622.90 --> 1625.70]  And he used to come in almost every week to our center.
[1625.70 --> 1631.52]  And he'd sit down and chat and he was, he'd come from a Hindu background, become a Christian.
[1632.24 --> 1634.70]  None of his family were Christians, didn't have a lot of support.
[1634.78 --> 1638.36]  So he said, you know, pray with me, share with me.
[1638.46 --> 1645.90]  And the last day he was in port, he said, I'm leaving, we're going on to another journey, another destination now.
[1646.16 --> 1648.66]  But he said, will you give me a word from the Lord?
[1648.86 --> 1649.54]  Preach to me.
[1649.62 --> 1650.82]  He literally said, preach to me.
[1650.84 --> 1652.44]  I don't get many individuals saying that.
[1652.44 --> 1656.64]  And he said, I said, well, I'm not going to preach a sermon, but let's read.
[1656.76 --> 1659.02]  And we read God's word together and we prayed.
[1659.72 --> 1661.72]  And then afterwards he said, do you have a Bible?
[1661.96 --> 1663.04]  I said, yeah, I've got Bibles.
[1663.42 --> 1664.54]  Let's look at what language.
[1664.70 --> 1672.62]  And I went through and he's from India, but we found a Bible in the Marathi language of India.
[1672.78 --> 1675.02]  And he was so excited, that's his mother tongue.
[1675.62 --> 1676.82]  And he said, can I have this?
[1676.84 --> 1679.18]  I said, of course, that's who it's for, it's for you.
[1679.46 --> 1681.78]  And we gave him the scriptures.
[1681.78 --> 1684.24]  So these are the kind of things that we're continuing to do.
[1684.46 --> 1686.24]  We're getting ready for Christmas at sea.
[1687.02 --> 1689.78]  So thank you for support for that as well.
[1690.52 --> 1695.38]  I know I saw the newsletter that I sent out posted up on your bulletin board.
[1695.48 --> 1697.98]  I hope you all were able to get access to that somehow.
[1698.32 --> 1702.44]  If not, look on ministrytoseafarers.com and you will find it under newsletters.
[1702.56 --> 1703.12]  Next slide.
[1703.12 --> 1708.08]  Oh, we have an intern right now, Georgia, in the front there.
[1708.38 --> 1713.72]  Georgia Omoa comes from sort of Uganda via Kenya and then studied at Regent.
[1713.88 --> 1715.66]  And she's working with us, doing a great job.
[1716.02 --> 1719.28]  She's with us at least until the end of the year, probably into the new year a little bit,
[1719.64 --> 1720.70]  helping out a lot.
[1720.70 --> 1727.14]  And we're actually looking to hire a new person to help more with our communications and things like that.
[1727.26 --> 1729.48]  So if you know of anybody who's interested, let me know.
[1729.62 --> 1730.08]  Next slide.
[1730.46 --> 1731.32]  I think it's the last one.
[1731.40 --> 1733.66]  Okay, there's my information.
[1734.16 --> 1735.76]  If you want to be in touch.
[1735.92 --> 1737.66]  But thank you so much for your support.

[1740.86 --> 1743.02]  For donations.
[1743.46 --> 1744.36]  For your prayers.
[1745.68 --> 1747.70]  Just do keep praying for the ministry.
[1748.52 --> 1750.26]  We got with my wife and I.
[1750.42 --> 1756.00]  When we went to that place where she gave her life to the Lord or near that area.
[1756.42 --> 1758.62]  She said, I've got to find a rock.
[1758.78 --> 1760.04]  And she stood on top of the rock.
[1760.04 --> 1769.44]  She said, I remember 45 years ago standing on the rock and just knowing that God would be my rock.
[1769.82 --> 1770.26]  Always.
[1770.26 --> 1772.02]  And he always has been.
[1772.44 --> 1776.72]  And that's the rock we want to make for the seafarers all the time.
[1776.80 --> 1779.50]  So thank you so much for your prayers and for your support.
[1779.74 --> 1785.72]  And continuing to care for seafarers who give so much to be away from their families.
[1786.02 --> 1788.94]  And really appreciate the support that we can give.
[1788.94 --> 1789.44]  Thank you.
[1789.44 --> 1805.24]  As the offering is being taken, we're going to offer a song that I wrote quite a few years ago.
[1805.24 --> 1807.66]  So I went through a bit of a rough spell.
[1808.26 --> 1813.04]  And I just wanted to remind myself of God's love for me.
[1813.20 --> 1815.48]  And I hope it resonates also for you.

[1862.02 --> 1864.02]  My burden is light.
[1864.02 --> 1865.02]  My yoke is easy.
[1865.02 --> 1866.02]  My burden is light.

[2071.78 --> 2078.44]  Good morning.
[2078.70 --> 2083.12]  We can have the three year olds up to grade four come join me at the front for a few minutes.
[2083.24 --> 2084.18]  Oh you guys are way over here.
[2085.26 --> 2088.56]  Why don't you guys come over this way and we'll chat just a quick minute.
[2089.20 --> 2090.58]  I can't even get to the chair.
[2093.78 --> 2096.56]  Hi guys.
[2096.56 --> 2102.38]  Hey, guess what, we're starting a new theme in children's worship time today.
[2102.90 --> 2105.06]  Do you guys remember what we've done the last four weeks?
[2105.58 --> 2106.22]  What have we done?
[2106.94 --> 2107.38]  Creation.
[2107.60 --> 2109.44]  We did a huge four weeks on creation.
[2109.78 --> 2112.44]  And now we're starting a new theme.
[2112.72 --> 2114.86]  And it's a little more complicated.
[2115.80 --> 2117.90]  It's on the theme of trust.
[2118.74 --> 2120.68]  It's a little word, but it's a big concept.
[2120.92 --> 2122.52]  What do you guys think trust means?
[2122.56 --> 2124.10]  What does it mean to trust something?
[2124.10 --> 2126.74]  We trust in God.
[2126.80 --> 2127.40]  What do you think Haley?
[2127.56 --> 2128.88]  I know a song about trust.
[2128.90 --> 2130.14]  We know a song about trust.
[2130.22 --> 2130.68]  That's cool.
[2130.78 --> 2134.04]  How would you explain trust to me?
[2134.82 --> 2136.92]  What does it mean to trust something?
[2138.90 --> 2140.10]  That's kind of tricky, hey?
[2140.36 --> 2147.72]  Is it like if I go outside right now and I don't put my coat on and my umbrella, what will happen to me?
[2147.80 --> 2149.66]  Do I trust the rain will make me wet?
[2150.36 --> 2151.46]  No, we don't trust that.
[2151.58 --> 2151.64]  No.
[2152.24 --> 2153.82]  Well that's not really trust though, is it?
[2153.82 --> 2155.04]  That's just something that will happen.
[2155.14 --> 2155.86]  I'll just get wet.
[2156.02 --> 2157.08]  We just figure that will happen.
[2157.08 --> 2164.10]  But what about if I sit on this chair and I expect it to stay sitting up?
[2164.62 --> 2166.38]  Is that trusting this chair to stay sitting?
[2167.38 --> 2168.16]  Yeah, it is.
[2168.18 --> 2168.48]  It is.
[2168.54 --> 2174.22]  I'm trusting these legs that they're not going to fall to pieces on me and that I can sit in this chair properly.
[2174.22 --> 2174.70]  Right?
[2174.70 --> 2175.14]  Right?
[2175.14 --> 2181.94]  Or like every day when your mom and dad's drive to work, they trust that their car is going to start.
[2182.26 --> 2184.62]  They trust that the brakes are still good.
[2184.70 --> 2185.02]  Right?
[2185.02 --> 2187.16]  We put a lot of trust in a lot of things.
[2187.30 --> 2188.58]  What do you trust, Hayley?
[2188.80 --> 2189.94]  We wear seatbelts.
[2189.94 --> 2190.20]  Yep.
[2190.34 --> 2192.48]  That we trust that the seatbelt's going to work properly.
[2192.86 --> 2194.90]  What about when you guys go to the pool?
[2195.54 --> 2196.62]  Who here goes to the pool?
[2197.36 --> 2197.76]  Lots.
[2198.00 --> 2198.14]  Yeah.
[2198.24 --> 2200.10]  It's like going to the pool every day outside right now.
[2200.98 --> 2201.26]  Yeah.
[2201.26 --> 2207.86]  And you run off the pool and you see your mom and dad right there and you jump into the water.
[2208.50 --> 2210.82]  Are you trusting your mom and dad to be there to help you out?
[2211.58 --> 2211.98]  No.
[2212.48 --> 2212.96]  Oh boy.
[2213.18 --> 2216.14]  Well, I think we have a couple sermons on our way then.
[2216.22 --> 2216.46]  Hey?
[2216.66 --> 2216.94]  Yeah.
[2217.46 --> 2218.26]  Well, sure we do.
[2218.30 --> 2220.32]  If you say, hey dad, you got to catch me.
[2220.92 --> 2222.48]  We trust he's going to do that.
[2222.52 --> 2222.82]  Right?
[2223.56 --> 2224.24]  And guess what?
[2224.66 --> 2227.46]  Sometimes people trust you guys to do stuff.
[2227.46 --> 2231.84]  Sometimes your moms and dads ask you guys to do things or your sisters and brothers
[2231.84 --> 2235.66]  or a grandma, grandpa or someone else and they expect you to do it.
[2235.74 --> 2235.82]  Right?
[2235.94 --> 2236.20]  Trust.
[2236.30 --> 2239.14]  There's like you expect something to happen.
[2239.42 --> 2244.42]  You believe something will follow through the way you think it's going to happen.
[2244.90 --> 2245.20]  Right?
[2245.86 --> 2249.10]  And trust is sometimes we have to do that without really knowing how it works.
[2249.50 --> 2249.68]  Right?
[2249.70 --> 2251.04]  I was thinking about that this morning.
[2251.08 --> 2252.16]  I was brushing my teeth.
[2252.48 --> 2253.90]  I was trushing the toothpaste.
[2253.98 --> 2255.56]  It's going to make sure everything's clean.
[2255.84 --> 2257.06]  I don't know how it works.
[2257.46 --> 2258.72]  I just trust it.
[2258.86 --> 2259.92]  I don't know how that stuff works.
[2259.98 --> 2260.66]  It's like magic.
[2260.80 --> 2260.92]  Right?
[2261.08 --> 2261.52]  Toothpaste.
[2262.32 --> 2265.34]  Anyway, we're going to talk more about that in Children's Worship Time.
[2265.40 --> 2269.16]  We've got some games to try out and we're going to start talking all about what it means
[2269.16 --> 2273.40]  to trust even sometimes when we don't really understand what's going on.
[2274.02 --> 2274.42]  Yeah?
[2275.00 --> 2275.24]  Okay.
[2275.28 --> 2278.90]  Let's stand and we'll do the Children's Blessing and then we'll head to Children's Worship Time.
[2282.04 --> 2282.56]  All right.
[2282.60 --> 2283.52]  Let's put our arms up.
[2284.26 --> 2284.56]  Ready?
[2284.56 --> 2284.64]  Ready?
[2285.50 --> 2287.14]  The Lord be with you.
[2287.46 --> 2289.28]  And now what will you do?
[2289.28 --> 2319.26]  Thank you.
[2319.28 --> 2322.02]  And I'd like to lead you in our congregational prayer.
[2325.00 --> 2327.82]  Lord, we come before you in this rainy morning.
[2328.48 --> 2331.62]  Lord, we come because you are the one who draws us here.
[2332.12 --> 2333.78]  You are the God of creation.
[2334.78 --> 2338.44]  You've created everything and you've held everything up in your hands.
[2339.02 --> 2342.02]  Lord, we see your hand in the changing of the seasons,
[2342.40 --> 2344.20]  the fact that the rain has returned once again,
[2344.32 --> 2348.12]  and we're thankful for that, that we can see the land replenished.
[2348.12 --> 2354.18]  Lord, we are thankful for the opportunity to spend time here and worship together.
[2356.62 --> 2360.56]  Lord, we have many concerns that we have in our hearts,
[2360.72 --> 2365.30]  and sometimes those things are health-related, sometimes they're mental illness.
[2366.06 --> 2369.84]  Lord, we have people in our church family who have undergone surgery
[2369.84 --> 2371.42]  and are looking forward to healing.
[2371.92 --> 2375.48]  We've had members that have broken bones and require healing that way.
[2375.48 --> 2379.12]  We have members that are suffering with mental illness,
[2379.28 --> 2381.26]  and we pray for healing in that way as well.
[2382.72 --> 2386.24]  Lord, we have many challenges in our lives,
[2386.38 --> 2390.48]  and some of those challenges including the loss of loved ones.
[2391.06 --> 2393.26]  I think of the Hubert's and Verkaiq families
[2393.26 --> 2396.48]  who have recently put to rest a father and grandfather.
[2396.48 --> 2401.50]  Lord, there are many others in our church that have been through the same.
[2402.52 --> 2406.88]  Sometimes it's a long ago, sometimes it's more recent.
[2407.22 --> 2409.86]  But each time there's an ache in our hearts,
[2409.96 --> 2413.82]  and we pray for your strength and a blessing in those families
[2413.82 --> 2415.72]  as they go through this grieving process.
[2415.72 --> 2420.52]  Lord, we're thankful for the many aspects of our church
[2420.52 --> 2422.56]  that we can be blessing others with,
[2423.18 --> 2427.68]  or whether that is in ministries to the children,
[2427.96 --> 2430.78]  as the children have just gone to the children's worship time,
[2431.34 --> 2432.96]  those who are leading cadets and gems,
[2433.34 --> 2437.46]  those who are doing coffee break and leading Bible studies and care groups.
[2438.60 --> 2441.46]  Lord, we ask that your hand be in each one of these groups,
[2441.46 --> 2442.76]  each one of the leaders,
[2443.72 --> 2446.06]  that you may be able to bless each one with the spirit
[2446.06 --> 2450.54]  and the desire and the willingness to do your will in the jobs that they have.
[2451.86 --> 2459.04]  Lord, we're thankful for Chris and Kevin and Brandon and Aaron
[2459.04 --> 2461.62]  who have gone down to Mexico to Rosarito
[2461.62 --> 2468.20]  to be able to connect with the group that our young people spend each spring with.
[2468.20 --> 2470.88]  We pray that you may bless their connections,
[2471.46 --> 2475.60]  that our church may be a blessing to those who are in need down there,
[2475.94 --> 2479.04]  the leaders of churches and Bible study groups there.
[2479.98 --> 2483.10]  We pray especially for Jody and Uriel and the work that they do,
[2483.72 --> 2486.20]  as that is also an outreach of our church ministry.
[2487.82 --> 2492.08]  Lord, we're thankful for the blessing of a women's conference in the last two days.
[2492.62 --> 2497.14]  Lord, that that may have been a time of sharing, of learning,
[2497.14 --> 2502.10]  of working through the process of grief sometimes,
[2502.24 --> 2504.16]  sometimes difficulties that you experience.
[2504.98 --> 2509.20]  We pray that that may have been an opportunity for healing,
[2510.02 --> 2513.50]  that those who have come through that may have been blessed.
[2513.50 --> 2527.16]  Lord, we're thankful once again for Bill Tuninghead to be able to preach your word.
[2527.64 --> 2533.94]  Lord, we're thankful that we can have somebody on our pulpit to be able to preach your word,
[2534.34 --> 2539.86]  or that your word may truly be words that are coming out of Bill's mouth this morning.
[2539.86 --> 2546.86]  Lord, we pray that our congregation may be welcoming to newcomers,
[2547.74 --> 2549.12]  to strangers in our community.
[2549.86 --> 2555.06]  Lord, that we may be your hands in helping those that are in need.
[2558.42 --> 2561.70]  Lord, we pray that we may be a blessing as we go out this week,
[2562.16 --> 2566.32]  that we may be able to share your word and your gospel to those that we work with,
[2566.44 --> 2567.64]  those we spend time with.
[2567.64 --> 2571.52]  Lord, we pray all this not because we are worthy,
[2572.10 --> 2575.18]  but because your Son, Jesus Christ, died for us on the cross.
[2576.28 --> 2577.86]  Lord, we come as sinful people.
[2578.36 --> 2579.60]  We come as brokenhearted.
[2580.30 --> 2585.12]  And we pray that your Spirit may work with us in our hearts, in our lives,
[2585.46 --> 2589.80]  that we may be further strengthened by our faith in you.
[2590.66 --> 2592.38]  This we ask in your name alone.
[2592.78 --> 2593.10]  Amen.
[2597.64 --> 2615.54]  Churches used to have pulpits.
[2617.94 --> 2619.26]  Gary, thank you for that.
[2619.84 --> 2621.10]  You blessed me.
[2621.18 --> 2621.96]  You blessed us.
[2621.96 --> 2624.22]  I don't know how many years ago.
[2624.50 --> 2625.96]  How many years have you been?
[2627.12 --> 2627.56]  Five.
[2627.66 --> 2627.84]  Okay.
[2628.10 --> 2633.02]  I served on a committee to evaluate, you know, seafarers to ministry.
[2634.90 --> 2637.76]  And so I got the big picture.
[2637.92 --> 2638.60]  It was so beautiful.
[2638.98 --> 2646.42]  And I am so grateful to God that you have accepted responsibility to serve in that ministry.
[2646.42 --> 2646.86]  Wow.
[2647.46 --> 2647.90]  Wow.
[2648.48 --> 2648.92]  Beautiful.
[2658.92 --> 2667.66]  Passage we're reading this morning is Matthew 11, verses 25 to 30.
[2669.88 --> 2673.84]  I'd like to read it, give it a little introduction, and then get into the message.
[2673.84 --> 2679.50]  Matthew 11.
[2680.50 --> 2684.46]  At that time, at that time, Jesus said,
[2685.04 --> 2688.62]  I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
[2689.32 --> 2693.36]  because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned
[2693.36 --> 2696.78]  and revealed them to little children.
[2696.78 --> 2703.86]  Yes, Father, for this is what you were pleased to do.
[2705.18 --> 2707.90]  And since Jesus was there praying,
[2709.52 --> 2714.76]  all things have been committed to me by my Father.
[2714.76 --> 2719.44]  No one knows the Son except the Father,
[2719.84 --> 2723.92]  and no one knows the Father except the Son,
[2724.58 --> 2728.94]  and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him.
[2731.54 --> 2732.94]  Come to me,
[2733.64 --> 2737.42]  all you who are weary and burdened,
[2737.42 --> 2741.24]  and I will give you rest.
[2742.24 --> 2745.24]  Take my yoke upon you and learn from me,
[2745.34 --> 2748.60]  for I am gentle and humble in heart,
[2749.04 --> 2753.16]  and you will find rest for your souls.
[2754.26 --> 2755.90]  For my yoke is easy,
[2756.58 --> 2758.66]  and my burden is light.
[2758.66 --> 2760.82]  The word of the Lord.
[2761.48 --> 2762.78]  Thanks be to God.
[2764.88 --> 2766.38]  Well, brothers and sisters,
[2766.72 --> 2768.48]  you're probably aware of that,
[2768.56 --> 2772.46]  that we're in that tradition called Protestants.
[2773.48 --> 2776.58]  Now, that really means you're protest people.
[2776.80 --> 2778.60]  We are protest ants.
[2780.50 --> 2781.34]  The Catholics,
[2781.98 --> 2784.44]  I don't know how we actually got the name,
[2784.44 --> 2789.46]  but this is October 30,
[2790.14 --> 2792.24]  and October 31st,
[2792.24 --> 2794.50]  I don't know if we celebrate all that much anymore,
[2794.64 --> 2796.08]  is really Reformation Day,
[2796.82 --> 2798.66]  because that's the day
[2798.66 --> 2803.06]  that the Protestant movement started.
[2804.18 --> 2805.88]  You know, they didn't know quite how to mark it,
[2805.88 --> 2808.88]  because a movement doesn't just start in an afternoon,
[2809.12 --> 2810.92]  but they mark it by the time
[2810.92 --> 2812.36]  when Martin Luther went
[2812.36 --> 2815.14]  and he posted his 95 statements
[2815.14 --> 2817.20]  on the door of the church in Wittenberg,
[2817.50 --> 2819.86]  because he was taking exception
[2819.86 --> 2822.74]  to some of the things that were going on
[2822.74 --> 2826.36]  in the Roman Catholic or the Catholic church.
[2828.60 --> 2829.24]  Particularly,
[2829.74 --> 2831.20]  that's the one that shines out,
[2832.16 --> 2834.24]  this matter of indulgences.
[2835.76 --> 2836.78]  Now, think about that.
[2838.16 --> 2840.00]  If this church was saying,
[2840.00 --> 2841.72]  if you pay money,
[2842.72 --> 2844.90]  your sins will be forgiven.
[2846.16 --> 2846.88]  We'd say,
[2846.96 --> 2850.34]  now that's pretty false teaching.
[2850.90 --> 2852.04]  That's what they were doing.
[2853.60 --> 2854.66]  Not only false,
[2855.00 --> 2856.66]  it is physically,
[2857.20 --> 2858.46]  you might say economically,
[2858.76 --> 2860.64]  and spiritually abusive.
[2861.52 --> 2862.62]  And even the Catholics
[2862.62 --> 2864.40]  have come to see the need
[2864.40 --> 2867.36]  of some reform within themselves.
[2867.36 --> 2871.38]  As, connecting to our passage,
[2871.54 --> 2873.36]  did the religious establishment
[2873.36 --> 2875.08]  in Jesus' day
[2875.08 --> 2877.78]  need serious reform?
[2879.46 --> 2881.50]  Those who were in charge of the temple
[2881.50 --> 2882.26]  and of worship
[2882.26 --> 2884.74]  needed correction,
[2885.00 --> 2885.82]  to put it lightly.
[2886.98 --> 2889.16]  And our passage begins with the words,
[2889.60 --> 2890.88]  at that time,
[2891.40 --> 2893.44]  what was happening?
[2893.44 --> 2893.80]  Well,
[2895.08 --> 2897.42]  what was happening at that time
[2897.42 --> 2898.90]  in the first century
[2898.90 --> 2900.88]  is in many ways
[2900.88 --> 2902.26]  similar to what was going on
[2902.26 --> 2903.80]  in the 16th century.
[2904.36 --> 2906.18]  We continually need
[2906.18 --> 2907.50]  reformation
[2907.50 --> 2908.86]  in our churches.
[2909.30 --> 2910.64]  We never should become
[2910.64 --> 2911.66]  smug,
[2912.44 --> 2912.72]  lest
[2912.72 --> 2915.32]  the force of religion
[2915.32 --> 2916.98]  takes over
[2916.98 --> 2918.24]  the power
[2918.24 --> 2919.58]  of the gospel.
[2919.58 --> 2922.34]  So what was happening
[2922.34 --> 2923.30]  in the first century?
[2926.38 --> 2926.86]  Well,
[2927.04 --> 2929.36]  the beginning of chapter 11,
[2929.54 --> 2930.46]  we discover,
[2930.80 --> 2931.82]  if we just get a little bit
[2931.82 --> 2932.82]  of context here,
[2932.98 --> 2933.18]  that
[2933.18 --> 2937.20]  Jesus' cousin John
[2937.20 --> 2938.18]  was in prison
[2938.18 --> 2940.12]  because
[2940.12 --> 2941.88]  John had called out
[2941.88 --> 2943.08]  his prime minister
[2943.08 --> 2943.74]  of the day,
[2943.82 --> 2944.42]  if you will,
[2944.76 --> 2946.08]  for doing something
[2946.08 --> 2947.36]  immoral.
[2947.36 --> 2948.70]  and so here
[2948.70 --> 2949.30]  he's sitting
[2949.30 --> 2950.44]  in jail
[2950.44 --> 2951.90]  and he's starting
[2951.90 --> 2952.76]  to wonder,
[2953.72 --> 2953.96]  you know,
[2954.76 --> 2956.60]  solitary confinement
[2956.60 --> 2957.40]  makes you have
[2957.40 --> 2959.12]  second thoughts.
[2960.76 --> 2962.30]  So he sends out
[2962.30 --> 2963.60]  his disciples,
[2963.86 --> 2964.30]  those who
[2964.30 --> 2965.60]  he taught,
[2965.86 --> 2966.18]  to say,
[2966.32 --> 2967.66]  ask Jesus,
[2968.48 --> 2969.52]  are you actually
[2969.52 --> 2970.94]  the one who was to come?
[2971.74 --> 2972.52]  Or should we yet
[2972.52 --> 2973.80]  expect somebody else?
[2975.00 --> 2975.88]  This is at the beginning
[2975.88 --> 2977.02]  of Matthew 11.
[2977.36 --> 2978.22]  And Jesus says,
[2978.30 --> 2978.76]  you send,
[2979.50 --> 2980.18]  you go back
[2980.18 --> 2981.56]  to John
[2981.56 --> 2982.60]  and you report
[2982.60 --> 2984.10]  what you've seen
[2984.10 --> 2985.02]  and heard.
[2985.14 --> 2986.42]  And here's what Jesus said,
[2986.44 --> 2987.20]  if we can have that
[2987.20 --> 2987.82]  on the PowerPoint.
[2988.50 --> 2988.86]  He said,
[2988.92 --> 2990.26]  the blind receive sight.
[2990.36 --> 2991.32]  I think I may have
[2991.32 --> 2991.96]  sent that in.
[2992.44 --> 2993.84]  The lame walk,
[2993.94 --> 2995.06]  those who have leprosy
[2995.06 --> 2995.72]  are cured.
[2996.14 --> 2997.38]  The deaf hear,
[2997.58 --> 2998.92]  the dead are raised,
[2999.26 --> 3000.66]  and the good news
[3000.66 --> 3001.48]  is preached
[3001.48 --> 3002.92]  to the poor.
[3002.92 --> 3005.52]  And he didn't add,
[3005.82 --> 3006.64]  and don't worry,
[3006.74 --> 3008.06]  I'll take care of Herod.
[3008.20 --> 3009.52]  He added this,
[3010.12 --> 3011.58]  blessed is the one
[3011.58 --> 3012.76]  who does not
[3012.76 --> 3014.42]  fall away
[3014.42 --> 3015.60]  on account
[3015.60 --> 3017.18]  of me.
[3019.38 --> 3020.50]  And then after
[3020.50 --> 3022.18]  he sends these folks away,
[3022.28 --> 3023.78]  he turns to his own disciples
[3023.78 --> 3025.32]  and he starts explaining
[3025.32 --> 3026.94]  what was going on
[3026.94 --> 3027.84]  with John,
[3027.84 --> 3030.12]  how it is
[3030.12 --> 3031.10]  that good people
[3031.10 --> 3031.84]  like him
[3031.84 --> 3033.18]  end up
[3033.18 --> 3034.20]  in prison.
[3035.62 --> 3036.04]  And Jesus,
[3036.20 --> 3036.68]  I'll put it
[3036.68 --> 3037.64]  in our own words,
[3037.84 --> 3038.04]  says,
[3038.14 --> 3038.36]  look,
[3039.90 --> 3040.78]  John came
[3040.78 --> 3041.74]  eating vegan
[3041.74 --> 3042.54]  and sleeping
[3042.54 --> 3043.26]  in the van
[3043.26 --> 3043.84]  and they said
[3043.84 --> 3044.84]  he's off his rocker.
[3045.60 --> 3046.58]  I come accepting
[3046.58 --> 3047.42]  all the extras
[3047.42 --> 3048.82]  and they call me
[3048.82 --> 3049.30]  a glutton,
[3049.88 --> 3050.42]  a drunkard.
[3052.86 --> 3053.90]  Jesus goes
[3053.90 --> 3054.54]  and he says,
[3054.68 --> 3055.58]  I want to compare
[3055.58 --> 3056.70]  this generation
[3056.70 --> 3058.48]  to little kids
[3058.48 --> 3059.98]  who no matter
[3059.98 --> 3061.40]  what game you offer,
[3061.76 --> 3062.70]  it's not the one
[3062.70 --> 3063.52]  they want to play.
[3066.18 --> 3067.00]  After that,
[3067.10 --> 3068.14]  Jesus goes on
[3068.14 --> 3069.24]  to denounce
[3069.24 --> 3070.20]  in verse 20
[3070.20 --> 3071.02]  the towns
[3071.02 --> 3073.06]  in which
[3073.06 --> 3073.70]  he had done
[3073.70 --> 3074.42]  miracles.
[3075.30 --> 3076.24]  He denounces
[3076.24 --> 3077.02]  them because
[3077.02 --> 3078.38]  they did not
[3078.38 --> 3079.34]  repent.
[3080.82 --> 3081.80]  And he issues
[3081.80 --> 3082.94]  strong warnings.
[3083.50 --> 3083.96]  This is
[3083.96 --> 3084.82]  loving,
[3085.14 --> 3085.72]  gentle Jesus
[3085.72 --> 3087.00]  in verse 24
[3087.00 --> 3087.62]  saying,
[3088.10 --> 3088.70]  it will be
[3088.70 --> 3089.78]  more bearable
[3089.78 --> 3090.66]  for Sodom
[3090.66 --> 3091.76]  and on the
[3091.76 --> 3092.58]  day of judgment
[3092.58 --> 3093.78]  than for
[3093.78 --> 3095.20]  those cities
[3095.20 --> 3096.74]  in which people
[3096.74 --> 3097.24]  did not
[3097.24 --> 3098.12]  repent.
[3100.18 --> 3100.68]  Well,
[3100.78 --> 3101.44]  it's at
[3101.44 --> 3102.86]  that time
[3102.86 --> 3104.90]  that Jesus
[3104.90 --> 3105.58]  says
[3105.58 --> 3107.14]  in verse 25,
[3108.10 --> 3109.04]  I praise you
[3109.04 --> 3109.50]  Father,
[3111.18 --> 3112.84]  Lord of heaven
[3112.84 --> 3113.40]  and on earth
[3113.40 --> 3115.54]  because you
[3115.54 --> 3116.06]  have hidden
[3116.06 --> 3116.92]  these things
[3116.92 --> 3118.00]  from the wise
[3118.00 --> 3118.56]  and learned
[3118.56 --> 3120.04]  and revealed
[3120.04 --> 3121.06]  them to
[3121.06 --> 3122.66]  little children.
[3122.90 --> 3123.16]  Yes,
[3123.26 --> 3123.60]  Father,
[3124.32 --> 3125.02]  for this
[3125.02 --> 3125.94]  was your
[3125.94 --> 3126.70]  good pleasure.
[3128.90 --> 3129.38]  Well,
[3129.44 --> 3130.06]  what are these
[3130.06 --> 3130.78]  things that
[3130.78 --> 3131.46]  Sunday school
[3131.46 --> 3132.52]  children get
[3132.52 --> 3134.82]  but the educated
[3134.82 --> 3135.82]  are missing?
[3135.82 --> 3138.36]  and why
[3138.36 --> 3138.96]  would it be
[3138.96 --> 3140.14]  actually God's
[3140.14 --> 3141.68]  good pleasure
[3141.68 --> 3143.78]  that the wise
[3143.78 --> 3144.92]  and the learned
[3144.92 --> 3146.26]  people are
[3146.26 --> 3147.20]  not getting
[3147.20 --> 3147.82]  what the
[3147.82 --> 3148.74]  children did?
[3149.88 --> 3150.46]  Shouldn't
[3150.46 --> 3151.54]  everyone get
[3151.54 --> 3151.68]  it?
[3151.76 --> 3152.70]  In fact,
[3153.54 --> 3154.38]  aren't these
[3154.38 --> 3155.62]  educated ones
[3155.62 --> 3156.62]  the very ones
[3156.62 --> 3157.16]  who you would
[3157.16 --> 3159.12]  prefer to
[3159.12 --> 3159.70]  get it?
[3160.70 --> 3161.54]  Intelligent,
[3162.10 --> 3163.24]  well-educated,
[3163.62 --> 3164.82]  influential people
[3164.82 --> 3165.66]  with life
[3165.66 --> 3166.38]  experience?
[3166.94 --> 3167.36]  Yes,
[3167.82 --> 3168.52]  give it to
[3168.52 --> 3168.88]  them.
[3171.30 --> 3171.90]  Well,
[3172.04 --> 3172.54]  in answer
[3172.54 --> 3173.10]  to that,
[3173.94 --> 3174.70]  first of all,
[3174.86 --> 3175.68]  Jesus never
[3175.68 --> 3176.62]  rejoices and
[3176.62 --> 3177.30]  he isn't here
[3177.30 --> 3178.24]  rejoicing in
[3178.24 --> 3179.20]  the unbelief
[3179.20 --> 3179.70]  of these
[3179.70 --> 3180.14]  people.
[3180.64 --> 3181.26]  I thank you
[3181.26 --> 3181.76]  God for
[3181.76 --> 3182.34]  reprobates.
[3182.40 --> 3182.78]  That's not
[3182.78 --> 3183.46]  what's happening.
[3183.94 --> 3184.60]  He's never
[3184.60 --> 3186.14]  grateful when
[3186.14 --> 3187.08]  people do
[3187.08 --> 3187.86]  not believe.
[3188.28 --> 3189.02]  Even here,
[3189.10 --> 3189.68]  he's calling
[3189.68 --> 3190.46]  for faith.
[3191.78 --> 3192.36]  And neither
[3192.36 --> 3192.96]  is Jesus
[3192.96 --> 3193.96]  saying that
[3193.96 --> 3194.62]  wisdom and
[3194.62 --> 3196.02]  learning is
[3196.02 --> 3196.66]  useless.
[3196.84 --> 3197.32]  He's not
[3197.32 --> 3198.12]  condemning
[3198.12 --> 3199.28]  intellectual
[3199.28 --> 3200.28]  power.
[3200.98 --> 3201.86]  He himself
[3201.86 --> 3202.86]  is all-wise.
[3203.54 --> 3203.82]  Is there
[3203.82 --> 3204.64]  any intellect
[3204.64 --> 3205.20]  in the
[3205.20 --> 3205.76]  universe
[3205.76 --> 3207.32]  more powerful
[3207.32 --> 3208.26]  or bright
[3208.26 --> 3209.10]  than that
[3209.10 --> 3210.14]  of Christ?
[3211.92 --> 3213.20]  What Jesus
[3213.20 --> 3213.98]  is speaking
[3213.98 --> 3214.86]  against is
[3214.86 --> 3215.72]  intellectual
[3215.72 --> 3216.88]  pride.
[3218.88 --> 3219.66]  Intellect
[3219.66 --> 3220.66]  does not
[3220.66 --> 3222.00]  shut Jesus
[3222.00 --> 3222.66]  out.
[3222.66 --> 3224.16]  Pride does.
[3225.34 --> 3225.68]  Or as
[3225.68 --> 3226.12]  was said
[3226.12 --> 3226.64]  earlier,
[3227.52 --> 3228.34]  the difficulty
[3228.34 --> 3229.30]  of saying
[3229.30 --> 3230.24]  I need
[3230.24 --> 3230.50]  you.
[3232.10 --> 3233.30]  That takes
[3233.30 --> 3233.80]  humility.
[3235.80 --> 3236.98]  Sharp minds
[3236.98 --> 3238.08]  can and
[3238.08 --> 3238.82]  they will
[3238.82 --> 3240.24]  come to
[3240.24 --> 3240.82]  Christ.
[3241.86 --> 3243.40]  But self-made
[3243.40 --> 3244.50]  know-it-alls
[3244.50 --> 3245.48]  will have no
[3245.48 --> 3246.76]  need for this
[3246.76 --> 3247.16]  teacher.
[3248.68 --> 3249.46]  Jesus isn't
[3249.46 --> 3250.10]  looking for
[3250.10 --> 3250.76]  ignorance,
[3251.22 --> 3252.32]  but for
[3252.32 --> 3252.92]  humility,
[3253.74 --> 3254.08]  for the
[3254.08 --> 3254.94]  trusting
[3254.94 --> 3256.70]  innocence of
[3256.70 --> 3257.52]  a child
[3257.52 --> 3258.56]  that will
[3258.56 --> 3259.42]  accept
[3259.42 --> 3261.02]  these things.
[3262.62 --> 3263.44]  What are
[3263.44 --> 3264.18]  these things
[3264.18 --> 3265.36]  that children
[3265.36 --> 3266.68]  can comprehend?
[3269.06 --> 3269.70]  Well,
[3269.76 --> 3270.84]  at first glance,
[3270.90 --> 3271.58]  when you hear
[3271.58 --> 3272.18]  what Jesus
[3272.18 --> 3272.68]  says,
[3272.76 --> 3273.02]  you say,
[3273.10 --> 3273.26]  oh,
[3273.34 --> 3274.00]  this is not
[3274.00 --> 3274.96]  what you call
[3274.96 --> 3276.56]  Sunday school
[3276.56 --> 3277.70]  type stuff,
[3277.80 --> 3278.24]  it sounds
[3278.24 --> 3278.84]  more like
[3278.84 --> 3279.70]  seminary
[3279.70 --> 3280.64]  material.
[3280.96 --> 3281.34]  And we do
[3281.34 --> 3282.04]  have to grant,
[3282.12 --> 3282.66]  he's talking
[3282.66 --> 3283.80]  to adults
[3283.80 --> 3284.12]  here,
[3284.20 --> 3284.52]  when he
[3284.52 --> 3285.08]  makes this
[3285.08 --> 3286.38]  next profound
[3286.38 --> 3287.30]  and actually
[3287.30 --> 3288.48]  deeply theological
[3288.48 --> 3289.20]  statement
[3289.20 --> 3291.02]  in verse 27.
[3293.20 --> 3294.72]  All things
[3294.72 --> 3297.52]  have been
[3297.52 --> 3298.12]  committed
[3298.12 --> 3299.34]  to me
[3299.34 --> 3301.84]  by my
[3301.84 --> 3302.26]  father.
[3302.26 --> 3304.26]  All things
[3304.26 --> 3305.26]  have been
[3305.26 --> 3306.26]  committed
[3306.26 --> 3307.10]  to me
[3307.10 --> 3307.40]  no one
[3307.40 --> 3308.04]  knows the
[3308.04 --> 3308.42]  son
[3308.42 --> 3309.38]  except the
[3309.38 --> 3309.76]  father.
[3311.32 --> 3312.24]  And no
[3312.24 --> 3312.82]  one knows
[3312.82 --> 3313.54]  the father
[3313.54 --> 3315.40]  except the
[3315.40 --> 3315.78]  son
[3315.78 --> 3318.52]  and those
[3318.52 --> 3319.02]  to whom
[3319.02 --> 3319.74]  the son
[3319.74 --> 3320.98]  chooses
[3320.98 --> 3322.80]  to reveal
[3322.80 --> 3323.14]  him.
[3326.14 --> 3326.98]  We need
[3326.98 --> 3327.30]  to let
[3327.30 --> 3328.02]  that sinking,
[3328.32 --> 3329.64]  that teaching
[3329.64 --> 3330.32]  or doctrine
[3330.32 --> 3331.02]  sink in.
[3331.02 --> 3333.72]  because there's
[3333.72 --> 3334.36]  some mystery,
[3334.60 --> 3335.52]  there's wonder
[3335.52 --> 3336.24]  attached,
[3336.80 --> 3337.32]  not only to
[3337.32 --> 3337.82]  what Jesus
[3337.82 --> 3338.46]  is saying,
[3338.58 --> 3339.92]  but to who
[3339.92 --> 3340.66]  he is.
[3340.72 --> 3341.06]  It's the
[3341.06 --> 3341.60]  kind of
[3341.60 --> 3342.44]  mystery that
[3342.44 --> 3343.68]  adults will
[3343.68 --> 3344.54]  try and figure
[3344.54 --> 3345.12]  it all out
[3345.12 --> 3345.56]  while kids
[3345.56 --> 3345.94]  will just
[3345.94 --> 3346.36]  sit there
[3346.36 --> 3347.10]  in amazement.
[3348.94 --> 3349.34]  It's like
[3349.34 --> 3350.60]  an astronomer
[3350.60 --> 3351.20]  looks at the
[3351.20 --> 3351.84]  sky and is
[3351.84 --> 3352.26]  trying to
[3352.26 --> 3352.82]  figure everything
[3352.82 --> 3353.04]  out.
[3353.28 --> 3353.30]  Well,
[3353.70 --> 3353.98]  you know,
[3354.06 --> 3354.92]  the kid in
[3354.92 --> 3355.40]  us just
[3355.40 --> 3355.92]  looks up
[3355.92 --> 3356.38]  as we did
[3356.38 --> 3356.70]  the other
[3356.70 --> 3357.24]  day when we
[3357.24 --> 3357.46]  were on
[3357.46 --> 3357.84]  vacation.
[3357.84 --> 3358.66]  We saw
[3358.66 --> 3359.30]  the Milky Way.
[3359.38 --> 3359.52]  It was
[3359.52 --> 3360.54]  unbelievable.
[3362.78 --> 3363.24]  Bookish
[3363.24 --> 3364.18]  theologians
[3364.18 --> 3364.80]  try to
[3364.80 --> 3365.76]  discover the
[3365.76 --> 3366.78]  historical
[3366.78 --> 3367.52]  Jesus.
[3368.08 --> 3368.70]  Kids just
[3368.70 --> 3369.08]  want to
[3369.08 --> 3369.48]  hear his
[3369.48 --> 3369.92]  story.
[3372.38 --> 3372.98]  Let me
[3372.98 --> 3373.64]  digress to
[3373.64 --> 3373.98]  make a
[3373.98 --> 3374.22]  point.
[3375.70 --> 3376.04]  And I'm
[3376.04 --> 3376.54]  really glad.
[3376.70 --> 3377.42]  I didn't
[3377.42 --> 3377.88]  know this
[3377.88 --> 3378.10]  was going
[3378.10 --> 3378.24]  to happen,
[3378.38 --> 3379.22]  but the
[3379.22 --> 3379.54]  one I'm
[3379.54 --> 3380.18]  speaking about,
[3380.22 --> 3380.82]  our granddaughter
[3380.82 --> 3381.34]  Hadley,
[3381.44 --> 3381.94]  she showed
[3381.94 --> 3382.32]  up this
[3382.32 --> 3382.56]  morning.
[3382.70 --> 3382.88]  I thought,
[3382.98 --> 3383.16]  oh,
[3383.22 --> 3383.44]  what's
[3383.44 --> 3383.90]  Hadley going
[3383.90 --> 3384.24]  to do?
[3384.56 --> 3385.00]  And you'll
[3385.00 --> 3385.90]  know why I'm
[3385.90 --> 3386.18]  a little
[3386.18 --> 3386.58]  concerned.
[3386.66 --> 3386.94]  But she
[3386.94 --> 3387.40]  left for
[3387.40 --> 3387.70]  Sunday
[3387.70 --> 3388.04]  school,
[3388.22 --> 3388.74]  so I
[3388.74 --> 3389.08]  can now
[3389.08 --> 3389.76]  talk about
[3389.76 --> 3389.94]  her.
[3390.24 --> 3391.78]  But Hadley,
[3391.90 --> 3392.74]  our granddaughter,
[3392.92 --> 3394.04]  was enamored
[3394.04 --> 3394.88]  with Santa.
[3395.36 --> 3396.06]  We came in
[3396.06 --> 3396.48]  one day
[3396.48 --> 3397.48]  talking about
[3397.48 --> 3397.96]  him and
[3397.96 --> 3398.66]  the elves
[3398.66 --> 3399.18]  and everything
[3399.18 --> 3399.56]  else,
[3399.66 --> 3400.28]  and I
[3400.28 --> 3400.74]  just saw
[3400.74 --> 3401.08]  false
[3401.08 --> 3401.48]  teaching.
[3402.70 --> 3403.46]  My wife
[3403.46 --> 3403.64]  said,
[3403.72 --> 3404.08]  don't go
[3404.08 --> 3404.36]  there.
[3405.16 --> 3405.90]  But I
[3405.90 --> 3406.42]  couldn't
[3406.42 --> 3406.86]  resist.
[3407.06 --> 3407.40]  I mean,
[3407.52 --> 3408.08]  shucks,
[3408.22 --> 3408.50]  false
[3408.50 --> 3409.04]  teaching.
[3409.22 --> 3409.84]  So I
[3409.84 --> 3410.22]  took a
[3410.22 --> 3410.58]  gentle
[3410.58 --> 3411.42]  apologetic
[3411.42 --> 3411.96]  approach,
[3412.08 --> 3412.32]  and I
[3412.32 --> 3412.52]  said,
[3412.60 --> 3412.96]  Hadley,
[3413.84 --> 3414.32]  tell me
[3414.32 --> 3414.98]  about
[3414.98 --> 3415.36]  Santa.
[3415.36 --> 3416.92]  She
[3416.92 --> 3417.30]  was more
[3417.30 --> 3417.74]  than happy
[3417.74 --> 3417.96]  to.
[3418.40 --> 3418.64]  She
[3418.64 --> 3419.04]  got up,
[3419.12 --> 3419.22]  she
[3419.22 --> 3419.60]  prompted
[3419.60 --> 3420.00]  herself
[3420.00 --> 3420.32]  on the
[3420.32 --> 3420.72]  chair in
[3420.72 --> 3421.26]  my office
[3421.26 --> 3421.52]  there,
[3421.96 --> 3422.72]  and she
[3422.72 --> 3423.22]  went on
[3423.22 --> 3423.58]  for a
[3423.58 --> 3423.88]  good
[3423.88 --> 3424.24]  minute.
[3425.20 --> 3425.42]  She
[3425.42 --> 3425.60]  was
[3425.60 --> 3426.12]  describing
[3426.12 --> 3426.64]  Santa,
[3427.06 --> 3427.36]  who he
[3427.36 --> 3427.76]  was,
[3428.28 --> 3428.48]  how he
[3428.48 --> 3428.78]  went all
[3428.78 --> 3429.12]  over the
[3429.12 --> 3429.44]  world,
[3429.84 --> 3430.30]  gave gifts
[3430.30 --> 3430.80]  to people,
[3430.92 --> 3431.38]  went down
[3431.38 --> 3432.12]  chimneys,
[3432.54 --> 3433.14]  was very
[3433.14 --> 3433.72]  generous,
[3434.10 --> 3434.36]  and she
[3434.36 --> 3435.80]  actually went
[3435.80 --> 3436.70]  around and she
[3436.70 --> 3437.66]  named all the
[3437.66 --> 3438.56]  people in
[3438.56 --> 3439.20]  our family,
[3439.32 --> 3439.70]  she gave
[3439.70 --> 3440.70]  gifts to all
[3440.70 --> 3441.08]  this,
[3441.52 --> 3442.10]  and then she
[3442.10 --> 3443.06]  concluded by
[3443.06 --> 3443.70]  saying,
[3444.22 --> 3445.14]  he gives
[3445.14 --> 3445.62]  gifts to
[3445.62 --> 3446.28]  everyone in
[3446.28 --> 3446.64]  the world,
[3446.76 --> 3447.04]  and I
[3447.04 --> 3447.34]  quote,
[3447.60 --> 3447.90]  even
[3447.90 --> 3448.48]  Americans.
[3453.30 --> 3453.94]  Later I
[3453.94 --> 3454.30]  asked her,
[3454.38 --> 3454.84]  so what if,
[3455.14 --> 3455.60]  because I was
[3455.60 --> 3456.26]  still trying to
[3456.26 --> 3457.12]  unearth her
[3457.12 --> 3458.16]  bad theology,
[3458.46 --> 3459.18]  so what if I
[3459.18 --> 3460.02]  don't get a
[3460.02 --> 3460.42]  gift?
[3461.44 --> 3462.10]  Dead serious,
[3462.46 --> 3462.94]  well I guess
[3462.94 --> 3463.56]  that would mean
[3463.56 --> 3463.90]  you were
[3463.90 --> 3464.32]  naughty.
[3467.12 --> 3467.78]  I had a
[3467.78 --> 3468.10]  word with
[3468.10 --> 3468.48]  her mother,
[3468.48 --> 3471.52]  and in
[3471.52 --> 3472.42]  the end,
[3472.80 --> 3473.38]  truth went
[3473.38 --> 3473.76]  out.
[3474.38 --> 3474.78]  Yes,
[3475.08 --> 3476.08]  not through
[3476.08 --> 3476.44]  me,
[3476.74 --> 3477.16]  but a few
[3477.16 --> 3478.04]  months later
[3478.04 --> 3478.74]  she discovered
[3478.74 --> 3479.20]  it wasn't
[3479.20 --> 3479.80]  true because
[3479.80 --> 3481.34]  her cousin
[3481.34 --> 3482.54]  Nico informed
[3482.54 --> 3482.92]  her that it
[3482.92 --> 3483.32]  was actually
[3483.32 --> 3484.10]  his mom
[3484.10 --> 3484.72]  that gave
[3484.72 --> 3485.00]  him all
[3485.00 --> 3485.28]  the gifts.
[3486.00 --> 3486.36]  Oh,
[3486.78 --> 3487.18]  that was,
[3488.12 --> 3488.70]  here's the
[3488.70 --> 3488.96]  point,
[3490.16 --> 3490.80]  kids will
[3490.80 --> 3491.34]  pretty much
[3491.34 --> 3491.92]  believe whatever
[3491.92 --> 3492.40]  you tell
[3492.40 --> 3492.62]  them.
[3495.68 --> 3496.42]  If you
[3496.42 --> 3497.48]  tell children
[3497.48 --> 3499.32]  this is
[3499.32 --> 3500.46]  mind boggling,
[3501.46 --> 3502.30]  the God
[3502.30 --> 3502.60]  of the
[3502.60 --> 3503.16]  universe
[3503.16 --> 3504.26]  who created
[3504.26 --> 3504.90]  everything
[3504.90 --> 3505.64]  there is,
[3506.86 --> 3507.40]  made a
[3507.40 --> 3508.26]  decision in
[3508.26 --> 3509.38]  time to
[3509.38 --> 3510.46]  come down
[3510.46 --> 3511.62]  as a
[3511.62 --> 3512.10]  baby.
[3515.22 --> 3516.22]  Get your
[3516.22 --> 3516.66]  head around
[3516.66 --> 3516.98]  that.
[3519.46 --> 3520.14]  And through
[3520.14 --> 3521.12]  this child
[3521.12 --> 3522.94]  to accomplish
[3522.94 --> 3525.08]  all things,
[3526.08 --> 3529.24]  all things
[3529.24 --> 3530.00]  have been
[3530.00 --> 3530.62]  committed
[3530.62 --> 3531.92]  to me,
[3532.44 --> 3533.36]  Jesus said.
[3534.36 --> 3535.36]  The kids
[3535.36 --> 3536.06]  could sense
[3536.06 --> 3536.28]  it.
[3537.26 --> 3537.86]  They were in
[3537.86 --> 3538.14]  awe.
[3539.72 --> 3540.38]  They could
[3540.38 --> 3541.28]  see his
[3541.28 --> 3542.02]  approach,
[3542.54 --> 3543.44]  his humility,
[3543.98 --> 3544.30]  his
[3544.30 --> 3545.22]  gentleness.
[3546.76 --> 3547.60]  But the
[3547.60 --> 3548.52]  theologians of
[3548.52 --> 3549.02]  the day were
[3549.02 --> 3549.72]  trying to figure
[3549.72 --> 3550.24]  him out.
[3550.86 --> 3551.72]  They didn't like
[3551.72 --> 3552.56]  his competition.
[3552.86 --> 3553.32]  The crowds
[3553.32 --> 3553.90]  were following
[3553.90 --> 3554.20]  him.
[3554.28 --> 3554.58]  They were
[3554.58 --> 3555.76]  dissecting
[3555.76 --> 3556.42]  every move
[3556.42 --> 3557.02]  he made.
[3557.38 --> 3557.58]  And they
[3557.58 --> 3558.08]  were keeping
[3558.08 --> 3558.68]  him at a
[3558.68 --> 3559.52]  safe distance.
[3561.80 --> 3562.22]  Listen,
[3562.38 --> 3562.88]  says Jesus,
[3563.06 --> 3563.66]  no one knows
[3563.66 --> 3564.14]  the Father
[3564.14 --> 3564.80]  in heaven
[3564.80 --> 3565.56]  like I do.
[3565.62 --> 3566.12]  And no one
[3566.12 --> 3567.38]  knows me
[3567.38 --> 3567.90]  like the
[3567.90 --> 3568.56]  Father does.
[3568.62 --> 3568.98]  We have
[3568.98 --> 3569.96]  this deep,
[3570.32 --> 3571.94]  rich relationship
[3571.94 --> 3573.38]  as Father
[3573.38 --> 3574.66]  and Son.
[3576.28 --> 3576.76]  And the
[3576.76 --> 3577.36]  kicker is
[3577.36 --> 3577.84]  that that
[3577.84 --> 3578.82]  beautiful,
[3579.58 --> 3580.18]  glorious
[3580.18 --> 3581.26]  relationship
[3581.26 --> 3582.62]  of love
[3582.62 --> 3583.94]  and unity
[3583.94 --> 3585.32]  is for
[3585.32 --> 3585.84]  everyone.
[3588.20 --> 3589.38]  But we
[3589.38 --> 3590.10]  don't get
[3590.10 --> 3590.78]  to set
[3590.78 --> 3591.86]  the terms
[3591.86 --> 3593.52]  of endearment.
[3594.44 --> 3595.50]  Here's the
[3595.50 --> 3596.72]  startling truth,
[3596.86 --> 3597.14]  which,
[3597.82 --> 3598.50]  if we will
[3598.50 --> 3599.84]  receive at
[3599.84 --> 3601.08]  face value,
[3602.18 --> 3603.20]  will radically
[3603.20 --> 3604.12]  alter our
[3604.12 --> 3605.62]  life and
[3605.62 --> 3606.14]  our
[3606.14 --> 3607.42]  relationships
[3607.42 --> 3608.42]  and how we
[3608.42 --> 3609.40]  view ourselves
[3609.40 --> 3610.18]  and the
[3610.18 --> 3611.12]  truth is
[3611.12 --> 3612.00]  that God
[3612.00 --> 3613.44]  has come
[3613.44 --> 3614.20]  to us
[3614.20 --> 3615.38]  as a gift
[3615.38 --> 3616.46]  from above
[3616.46 --> 3618.52]  through Christ.
[3619.52 --> 3620.36]  He's simply
[3620.36 --> 3620.94]  living on
[3620.94 --> 3621.50]  this earth.
[3622.66 --> 3623.34]  The way
[3623.34 --> 3624.06]  he died.
[3625.24 --> 3626.02]  Powerful
[3626.02 --> 3629.12]  resurrection.
[3630.28 --> 3630.54]  His
[3630.54 --> 3631.06]  descending
[3631.06 --> 3631.92]  into heaven.
[3631.92 --> 3632.92]  God
[3632.92 --> 3633.92]  is
[3633.92 --> 3634.92]  God
[3634.92 --> 3635.36]  If you
[3635.36 --> 3636.06]  believe
[3636.06 --> 3637.58]  that that
[3637.58 --> 3638.32]  happened
[3638.32 --> 3639.60]  and that
[3639.60 --> 3640.16]  that is
[3640.16 --> 3640.64]  God
[3640.64 --> 3641.34]  coming to
[3641.34 --> 3641.86]  you and
[3641.86 --> 3642.24]  me,
[3642.68 --> 3643.34]  displaying
[3643.34 --> 3644.60]  his love
[3644.60 --> 3645.40]  and his
[3645.40 --> 3645.92]  mercy,
[3646.44 --> 3647.10]  you get
[3647.10 --> 3647.74]  to enter
[3647.74 --> 3648.34]  into
[3648.34 --> 3649.04]  that
[3649.04 --> 3649.86]  relationship
[3649.86 --> 3651.12]  that Jesus
[3651.12 --> 3652.26]  has.
[3653.26 --> 3654.20]  If we
[3654.20 --> 3654.74]  will not
[3654.74 --> 3655.70]  resist
[3655.70 --> 3656.96]  his inviting
[3656.96 --> 3657.80]  spirit,
[3658.18 --> 3658.98]  we will be
[3658.98 --> 3659.94]  pulled into
[3659.94 --> 3661.56]  this redemptive
[3661.56 --> 3662.36]  relationship
[3662.36 --> 3663.70]  through Christ.
[3668.36 --> 3669.18]  Now this
[3669.18 --> 3669.54]  isn't
[3669.54 --> 3670.86]  something that
[3670.86 --> 3672.28]  requires a
[3672.28 --> 3673.28]  high IQ,
[3673.58 --> 3674.06]  if you will.
[3675.22 --> 3675.78]  You don't
[3675.78 --> 3676.28]  need to go to
[3676.28 --> 3676.76]  university.
[3676.98 --> 3677.38]  In fact,
[3677.68 --> 3678.38]  quite frankly,
[3678.92 --> 3679.54]  most people
[3679.54 --> 3680.50]  lose their
[3680.50 --> 3680.90]  faith,
[3681.36 --> 3682.22]  particularly at
[3682.22 --> 3682.64]  today's
[3682.64 --> 3683.20]  universities.
[3684.16 --> 3684.86]  But you
[3684.86 --> 3685.32]  don't have to
[3685.32 --> 3685.88]  go there or
[3685.88 --> 3686.74]  to seminary.
[3686.74 --> 3689.20]  all you
[3689.20 --> 3689.64]  and I
[3689.64 --> 3690.22]  need to
[3690.22 --> 3690.62]  know
[3690.62 --> 3692.16]  about God
[3692.16 --> 3694.06]  and to
[3694.06 --> 3694.42]  live in
[3694.42 --> 3694.98]  this world
[3694.98 --> 3695.46]  that he's
[3695.46 --> 3696.14]  placed us
[3696.14 --> 3696.54]  in,
[3697.06 --> 3697.94]  starts and
[3697.94 --> 3698.58]  ends with
[3698.58 --> 3699.86]  listening to
[3699.86 --> 3700.42]  the voice
[3700.42 --> 3700.98]  of Jesus
[3700.98 --> 3701.98]  and being
[3701.98 --> 3703.06]  ready to
[3703.06 --> 3703.70]  obey it.
[3705.72 --> 3706.36]  Again,
[3706.44 --> 3707.00]  Jesus is
[3707.00 --> 3707.52]  the center
[3707.52 --> 3707.96]  of all
[3707.96 --> 3708.42]  thought.
[3709.64 --> 3710.22]  In him
[3710.22 --> 3710.90]  are hidden
[3710.90 --> 3713.16]  all the
[3713.16 --> 3713.64]  treasures
[3713.64 --> 3714.72]  of wisdom
[3714.72 --> 3716.32]  and knowledge.
[3717.80 --> 3718.60]  And no
[3718.60 --> 3718.98]  one will
[3718.98 --> 3719.54]  help you
[3719.54 --> 3720.08]  or I
[3720.08 --> 3720.72]  think more
[3720.72 --> 3721.32]  clearly
[3721.32 --> 3722.92]  than Jesus
[3722.92 --> 3724.14]  because he
[3724.14 --> 3724.86]  carries the
[3724.86 --> 3726.18]  secret to
[3726.18 --> 3727.46]  God's
[3727.46 --> 3728.36]  predestined
[3728.36 --> 3729.62]  plan for
[3729.62 --> 3730.44]  this world
[3730.44 --> 3731.28]  and for
[3731.28 --> 3731.76]  our life
[3731.76 --> 3732.38]  personally.
[3734.36 --> 3735.60]  It's God's
[3735.60 --> 3737.26]  choice to
[3737.26 --> 3737.94]  do all his
[3737.94 --> 3738.70]  communicating
[3738.70 --> 3739.46]  of who he
[3739.46 --> 3740.92]  is through
[3740.92 --> 3741.76]  his son,
[3742.64 --> 3742.98]  Jesus.
[3744.72 --> 3745.86]  And so
[3745.86 --> 3746.30]  that's what
[3746.30 --> 3747.00]  Jesus does
[3747.00 --> 3747.48]  next.
[3747.62 --> 3747.88]  And this
[3747.88 --> 3748.32]  is usually
[3748.32 --> 3748.92]  the passage
[3748.92 --> 3750.00]  we like to
[3750.00 --> 3750.42]  quote the
[3750.42 --> 3751.16]  most because
[3751.16 --> 3751.52]  it's so
[3751.52 --> 3751.92]  beautiful.
[3752.12 --> 3752.64]  When Jesus
[3752.64 --> 3753.32]  says in
[3753.32 --> 3754.26]  verses 28
[3754.26 --> 3755.18]  and 29,
[3755.74 --> 3756.28]  come to
[3756.28 --> 3757.36]  me, all
[3757.36 --> 3757.98]  you who
[3757.98 --> 3758.54]  are weary
[3758.54 --> 3759.84]  and burdened,
[3759.84 --> 3760.44]  and I'll
[3760.44 --> 3760.80]  give you
[3760.80 --> 3761.32]  rest.
[3762.12 --> 3762.84]  Take my
[3762.84 --> 3763.48]  yoke upon
[3763.48 --> 3765.06]  you and
[3765.06 --> 3766.40]  learn from
[3766.40 --> 3768.04]  me, from
[3768.04 --> 3769.38]  gentle and
[3769.38 --> 3769.98]  humble in
[3769.98 --> 3771.62]  heart, and
[3771.62 --> 3772.16]  you will
[3772.16 --> 3773.26]  find rest
[3773.26 --> 3773.92]  for your
[3773.92 --> 3774.46]  souls.
[3774.72 --> 3776.04]  for my
[3776.04 --> 3776.48]  yoke is
[3776.48 --> 3777.78]  easy and
[3777.78 --> 3778.52]  my burden
[3778.52 --> 3779.76]  is light.
[3782.12 --> 3782.98]  What a
[3782.98 --> 3783.92]  wonderful word
[3783.92 --> 3784.48]  for our
[3784.48 --> 3785.46]  weary world,
[3787.30 --> 3788.18]  torn apart
[3788.18 --> 3789.70]  by COVID,
[3790.78 --> 3791.62]  politics,
[3793.20 --> 3793.96]  and a
[3793.96 --> 3794.76]  free-for-all
[3794.76 --> 3795.78]  of ideologies
[3795.78 --> 3796.36]  out there.
[3796.36 --> 3799.74]  to those
[3799.74 --> 3800.92]  exhausted with
[3800.92 --> 3801.88]  the task
[3801.88 --> 3802.48]  of trying
[3802.48 --> 3803.08]  to eke
[3803.08 --> 3804.14]  out a
[3804.14 --> 3804.48]  living,
[3805.58 --> 3806.40]  to anyone
[3806.40 --> 3807.48]  tired of
[3807.48 --> 3808.50]  never quite
[3808.50 --> 3810.20]  measuring up
[3810.20 --> 3811.04]  and burdened
[3811.04 --> 3811.48]  by this
[3811.48 --> 3812.56]  pressure to
[3812.56 --> 3813.34]  succeed,
[3813.94 --> 3815.20]  Jesus offers
[3815.20 --> 3817.52]  himself as
[3817.52 --> 3818.56]  peace and
[3818.56 --> 3818.96]  rest.
[3818.96 --> 3819.06]  rest.
[3820.28 --> 3821.04]  There's a
[3821.04 --> 3821.46]  lot of
[3821.46 --> 3822.30]  confusion in
[3822.30 --> 3822.76]  our world
[3822.76 --> 3824.58]  today, and
[3824.58 --> 3824.94]  it really
[3824.94 --> 3825.48]  doesn't matter
[3825.48 --> 3825.86]  where you
[3825.86 --> 3827.68]  go, whether
[3827.68 --> 3828.20]  it's in the
[3828.20 --> 3829.02]  business world,
[3829.18 --> 3829.80]  the political
[3829.80 --> 3831.58]  world, education
[3831.58 --> 3833.44]  world, the
[3833.44 --> 3834.26]  church world,
[3835.26 --> 3836.62]  we find people
[3836.62 --> 3837.60]  pushing their
[3837.60 --> 3840.40]  agendas, and
[3840.40 --> 3840.94]  in our
[3840.94 --> 3843.28]  competitive world
[3843.28 --> 3843.94]  where some
[3843.94 --> 3845.16]  win and too
[3845.16 --> 3845.96]  many lose,
[3845.96 --> 3847.32]  most everyone
[3847.32 --> 3847.98]  gets worn
[3847.98 --> 3848.30]  out.
[3849.70 --> 3850.14]  And I think
[3850.14 --> 3850.64]  that's why
[3850.64 --> 3851.98]  folks are
[3851.98 --> 3853.00]  often so eager
[3853.00 --> 3854.02]  to get on
[3854.02 --> 3854.82]  a plane and
[3854.82 --> 3856.36]  not worry
[3856.36 --> 3857.34]  too much, at
[3857.34 --> 3857.80]  least for the
[3857.80 --> 3858.32]  moment, how
[3858.32 --> 3858.86]  much crude
[3858.86 --> 3859.34]  oil it's
[3859.34 --> 3859.58]  going to
[3859.58 --> 3860.22]  take, just
[3860.22 --> 3861.14]  bring me to
[3861.14 --> 3861.72]  a sunny,
[3861.86 --> 3862.66]  restful place.
[3865.40 --> 3865.60]  You know,
[3865.66 --> 3866.04]  the folks
[3866.04 --> 3866.80]  Jesus spoke
[3866.80 --> 3867.94]  to were
[3867.94 --> 3868.72]  burdened by
[3868.72 --> 3870.62]  a combination
[3870.62 --> 3871.82]  of political
[3871.82 --> 3873.64]  and religious
[3873.64 --> 3874.98]  obligations.
[3875.96 --> 3880.36]  church can
[3880.36 --> 3881.10]  also be a
[3881.10 --> 3881.60]  place like
[3881.60 --> 3881.84]  that.
[3883.02 --> 3883.74]  If we
[3883.74 --> 3884.40]  aren't careful,
[3885.12 --> 3885.64]  pressure,
[3886.58 --> 3887.16]  obligation,
[3889.00 --> 3891.20]  I confess
[3891.20 --> 3891.66]  to being
[3891.66 --> 3892.04]  guilty.
[3892.28 --> 3892.92]  As a
[3892.92 --> 3893.48]  pastor, I
[3893.48 --> 3894.06]  wanted to
[3894.06 --> 3895.32]  make things
[3895.32 --> 3895.98]  happen.
[3896.92 --> 3897.66]  We're going
[3897.66 --> 3898.34]  to be a
[3898.34 --> 3899.86]  going church.
[3901.48 --> 3902.40]  And, you
[3902.40 --> 3903.48]  know, whenever
[3903.48 --> 3904.32]  we start, and
[3904.32 --> 3904.76]  you have to be
[3904.76 --> 3906.00]  careful, it
[3906.00 --> 3906.56]  gets to be a
[3906.56 --> 3907.54]  longer story, but
[3907.54 --> 3908.10]  that's often
[3908.10 --> 3908.84]  when things can
[3908.84 --> 3909.76]  get ugly and
[3909.76 --> 3912.48]  souls can get
[3912.48 --> 3914.04]  scarred and
[3914.04 --> 3915.36]  hearts can be
[3915.36 --> 3916.42]  made weary by
[3916.42 --> 3917.22]  the varying
[3917.22 --> 3919.70]  obligations and
[3919.70 --> 3920.44]  accompanying
[3920.44 --> 3921.70]  tension.
[3923.78 --> 3924.98]  I will
[3924.98 --> 3925.68]  confess, I
[3925.68 --> 3926.38]  haven't often
[3926.38 --> 3927.16]  been patient
[3927.16 --> 3927.64]  enough.
[3929.16 --> 3930.02]  Willing to
[3930.02 --> 3930.56]  live in
[3930.56 --> 3931.60]  Christian community
[3931.60 --> 3932.60]  and asking the
[3932.60 --> 3933.24]  question, what
[3933.24 --> 3934.06]  does it mean as
[3934.06 --> 3934.76]  followers of
[3934.76 --> 3935.90]  Christ to
[3935.90 --> 3936.44]  take the
[3936.44 --> 3937.22]  next step
[3937.22 --> 3939.82]  together in
[3939.82 --> 3941.56]  him, trusting
[3941.56 --> 3941.92]  him?
[3945.64 --> 3946.96]  And I
[3946.96 --> 3948.16]  think this is
[3948.16 --> 3949.50]  why our
[3949.50 --> 3950.30]  culture has
[3950.30 --> 3951.54]  thrown out, and
[3951.54 --> 3952.28]  we hear a lot of
[3952.28 --> 3953.56]  negative talk
[3953.56 --> 3954.54]  today about
[3954.54 --> 3955.66]  evangelical
[3955.66 --> 3957.26]  Christians in
[3957.26 --> 3957.96]  North America,
[3957.96 --> 3959.26]  America, because
[3959.26 --> 3959.90]  they've come to
[3959.90 --> 3960.88]  see it as
[3960.88 --> 3962.90]  legalistic, and
[3962.90 --> 3963.92]  something that
[3963.92 --> 3965.00]  strips joy and
[3965.00 --> 3966.24]  peace from
[3966.24 --> 3967.00]  their life.
[3968.78 --> 3969.32]  Now, in all
[3969.32 --> 3970.58]  fairness, if I
[3970.58 --> 3971.62]  may, if we
[3971.62 --> 3972.84]  ask whether
[3972.84 --> 3973.92]  people today are
[3973.92 --> 3975.32]  more at peace
[3975.32 --> 3977.04]  without religion,
[3978.54 --> 3979.12]  is this
[3979.12 --> 3980.26]  churchless
[3980.26 --> 3982.46]  generation, as
[3982.46 --> 3984.08]  it's increasing,
[3984.62 --> 3985.60]  are they more
[3985.60 --> 3986.42]  at peace?
[3986.42 --> 3986.54]  peace?
[3987.74 --> 3988.80]  I think you
[3988.80 --> 3989.14]  know the
[3989.14 --> 3989.58]  answer.
[3990.76 --> 3991.12]  But the
[3991.12 --> 3992.48]  point being, it
[3992.48 --> 3992.94]  doesn't matter
[3992.94 --> 3994.62]  who we are, no
[3994.62 --> 3995.84]  one is exempt
[3995.84 --> 3997.00]  from the call
[3997.00 --> 3999.04]  of Christ and
[3999.04 --> 4000.06]  from our need
[4000.06 --> 4000.78]  for him.
[4002.10 --> 4003.10]  No better
[4003.10 --> 4004.22]  person than
[4004.22 --> 4006.58]  Jesus, so
[4006.58 --> 4008.76]  gentle and
[4008.76 --> 4009.82]  humble of
[4009.82 --> 4010.36]  heart.
[4011.40 --> 4011.98]  The word
[4011.98 --> 4012.58]  gentle there
[4012.58 --> 4013.60]  means meek,
[4014.76 --> 4015.08]  and that
[4015.08 --> 4015.48]  doesn't mean
[4015.48 --> 4016.10]  pushover,
[4016.42 --> 4016.96]  the Bible
[4016.96 --> 4017.62]  says Moses
[4017.62 --> 4018.06]  was the
[4018.06 --> 4018.66]  meekest man
[4018.66 --> 4019.10]  on all the
[4019.10 --> 4019.60]  earth, and
[4019.60 --> 4020.68]  if you don't
[4020.68 --> 4021.16]  have to read
[4021.16 --> 4021.80]  too long to
[4021.80 --> 4022.12]  know that
[4022.12 --> 4022.88]  Moses was no
[4022.88 --> 4023.46]  pushover.
[4024.96 --> 4025.94]  Jesus is the
[4025.94 --> 4027.30]  meekest of
[4027.30 --> 4028.18]  all servants,
[4028.58 --> 4028.94]  he's very
[4028.94 --> 4030.36]  gentle, but
[4030.36 --> 4031.00]  he's also very
[4031.00 --> 4033.24]  firm, revealing
[4033.24 --> 4034.64]  to us the
[4034.64 --> 4036.04]  tender heart
[4036.04 --> 4037.16]  of God.
[4039.22 --> 4040.30]  God's entire
[4040.30 --> 4043.14]  approach in
[4043.14 --> 4044.40]  identifying with
[4044.40 --> 4046.58]  humans is
[4046.58 --> 4047.20]  revealed to
[4047.20 --> 4047.74]  us in
[4047.74 --> 4048.40]  Jesus, where
[4048.40 --> 4049.84]  we see his
[4049.84 --> 4051.60]  heart, his
[4051.60 --> 4052.26]  humility,
[4053.22 --> 4054.32]  identifying with
[4054.32 --> 4056.18]  us in our
[4056.18 --> 4057.70]  flesh, taking
[4057.70 --> 4058.26]  on our
[4058.26 --> 4059.02]  burdens to
[4059.02 --> 4060.04]  the point you
[4060.04 --> 4060.86]  might say it
[4060.86 --> 4062.52]  wearied him to
[4062.52 --> 4063.02]  death.
[4065.10 --> 4066.52]  There we see
[4066.52 --> 4068.14]  how high and
[4068.14 --> 4069.16]  wide and deep
[4069.16 --> 4070.36]  and long is
[4070.36 --> 4071.54]  the love of
[4071.54 --> 4072.06]  the Father.
[4074.56 --> 4075.42]  And it's this
[4075.42 --> 4076.26]  Jesus who
[4076.26 --> 4077.06]  calls us,
[4077.26 --> 4077.82]  first of all,
[4077.90 --> 4078.74]  simply to
[4078.74 --> 4079.76]  come to
[4079.76 --> 4080.16]  him.
[4081.40 --> 4081.94]  I love
[4081.94 --> 4083.72]  reading what
[4083.72 --> 4084.54]  Oskin has
[4084.54 --> 4085.68]  said in his
[4085.68 --> 4086.00]  book.
[4086.12 --> 4086.68]  It's a book
[4086.68 --> 4087.38]  called The
[4087.38 --> 4087.82]  Call.
[4088.32 --> 4088.78]  He says,
[4089.32 --> 4089.96]  we are not,
[4090.12 --> 4091.04]  some of you may
[4091.04 --> 4091.72]  know this author,
[4091.84 --> 4092.82]  we're not primarily
[4092.82 --> 4094.52]  called to do
[4094.52 --> 4096.18]  something or
[4096.18 --> 4097.32]  go somewhere,
[4097.80 --> 4099.50]  we're called to
[4099.50 --> 4100.18]  someone.
[4101.70 --> 4102.04]  It's a little
[4102.04 --> 4102.86]  bit like marriage,
[4102.92 --> 4103.40]  if you will.
[4104.44 --> 4105.78]  We don't marry
[4105.78 --> 4106.60]  someone for what
[4106.60 --> 4107.26]  they'll do for
[4107.26 --> 4108.48]  us, but simply
[4108.48 --> 4109.22]  to be with
[4109.22 --> 4109.42]  them.
[4110.90 --> 4111.60]  We're not
[4111.60 --> 4112.68]  called first to
[4112.68 --> 4113.82]  special work,
[4114.88 --> 4116.40]  but to God.
[4117.76 --> 4119.24]  And Jesus is
[4119.24 --> 4120.14]  that call.
[4121.78 --> 4122.68]  As Augustine
[4122.68 --> 4123.64]  said, our hearts
[4123.64 --> 4124.46]  will remain
[4124.46 --> 4125.68]  restless until
[4125.68 --> 4126.96]  we do come
[4126.96 --> 4128.46]  to rest in
[4128.46 --> 4128.86]  Jesus.
[4130.06 --> 4130.82]  And when we
[4130.82 --> 4131.64]  believe in him
[4131.64 --> 4132.52]  and are embraced
[4132.52 --> 4133.16]  by him,
[4133.90 --> 4134.72]  then, yeah,
[4134.82 --> 4135.34]  he'll give us
[4135.34 --> 4135.96]  something to do.
[4136.08 --> 4136.70]  Becoming a
[4136.70 --> 4137.30]  Christian and
[4137.30 --> 4138.00]  accepting the
[4138.00 --> 4138.56]  call doesn't
[4138.56 --> 4139.82]  mean we get
[4139.82 --> 4140.84]  lazy and do
[4140.84 --> 4141.28]  nothing.
[4143.04 --> 4143.98]  No one who
[4143.98 --> 4144.62]  enters the
[4144.62 --> 4145.42]  kingdom of God
[4145.42 --> 4145.92]  will find
[4145.92 --> 4146.84]  themselves suddenly
[4146.84 --> 4147.54]  bored to
[4147.54 --> 4148.66]  death or
[4148.66 --> 4149.20]  unemployed.
[4149.88 --> 4150.54]  He, as it
[4150.54 --> 4151.90]  were, yokes
[4151.90 --> 4152.58]  us up.
[4152.74 --> 4153.56]  Come to me,
[4153.64 --> 4154.30]  and I'll
[4154.30 --> 4155.20]  also give you
[4155.20 --> 4156.18]  something meaningful
[4156.18 --> 4157.34]  to do.
[4158.26 --> 4159.08]  A yoke.
[4160.22 --> 4160.88]  Jesus was
[4160.88 --> 4161.56]  familiar with
[4161.56 --> 4161.72]  them.
[4162.82 --> 4163.14]  They were
[4163.14 --> 4164.06]  measured carefully
[4164.06 --> 4164.96]  like a suit
[4164.96 --> 4166.02]  to fit a body.
[4167.50 --> 4168.30]  Or, you might
[4168.30 --> 4168.90]  say, like a
[4168.90 --> 4169.22]  dentist.
[4169.50 --> 4169.86]  You know, they
[4169.86 --> 4171.42]  put a bridge
[4171.42 --> 4172.06]  in or a
[4172.06 --> 4172.66]  mold and they
[4172.66 --> 4174.18]  make it just
[4174.18 --> 4175.72]  right so that
[4175.72 --> 4176.42]  you can bite
[4176.42 --> 4177.14]  hard and not
[4177.14 --> 4177.94]  have any pain.
[4178.78 --> 4179.46]  That's what a
[4179.46 --> 4180.08]  yoke is meant
[4180.08 --> 4180.56]  to be.
[4182.04 --> 4182.52]  And Jesus
[4182.52 --> 4183.40]  does lay on
[4183.40 --> 4184.02]  us burdens.
[4186.14 --> 4186.90]  Put it this
[4186.90 --> 4187.28]  way, and
[4187.28 --> 4187.66]  we'll end
[4187.66 --> 4188.84]  with just
[4188.84 --> 4189.50]  talking about
[4189.50 --> 4189.94]  what this
[4189.94 --> 4190.52]  yoke might
[4190.52 --> 4190.84]  be.
[4190.92 --> 4191.34]  As our
[4191.34 --> 4191.90]  hearts are
[4191.90 --> 4193.22]  softened and
[4193.22 --> 4194.58]  strengthened by
[4194.58 --> 4196.18]  God's love,
[4197.08 --> 4197.68]  we'll start
[4197.68 --> 4198.78]  seeing needs.
[4199.82 --> 4200.44]  Something will
[4200.44 --> 4201.30]  stir in us.
[4202.84 --> 4204.16]  It may be a
[4204.16 --> 4205.38]  holy discontent.
[4205.38 --> 4205.98]  It may even
[4205.98 --> 4206.38]  be some
[4206.38 --> 4206.76]  anger.
[4207.68 --> 4207.98]  You see
[4207.98 --> 4211.46]  things that's
[4211.46 --> 4212.02]  not right.
[4212.92 --> 4213.80]  That can be a
[4213.80 --> 4214.22]  nudge from
[4214.22 --> 4214.80]  God, by the
[4214.80 --> 4215.00]  way.
[4216.88 --> 4218.38]  Because you're
[4218.38 --> 4219.02]  seeing often
[4219.02 --> 4220.06]  an injustice
[4220.06 --> 4221.12]  or a hurt
[4221.12 --> 4222.84]  that needs to
[4222.84 --> 4223.60]  be justified
[4223.60 --> 4224.68]  or healed.
[4226.72 --> 4227.54]  We need to
[4227.54 --> 4228.14]  bring such
[4228.14 --> 4228.74]  matters to
[4228.74 --> 4229.12]  God.
[4230.62 --> 4231.58]  Invite Christ
[4231.58 --> 4232.14]  into our
[4232.14 --> 4232.98]  space, whatever
[4232.98 --> 4233.68]  it is that's
[4233.68 --> 4234.60]  troubling us.
[4234.60 --> 4235.66]  so that we
[4235.66 --> 4236.06]  don't just
[4236.06 --> 4237.40]  take it on
[4237.40 --> 4238.10]  ourselves.
[4239.62 --> 4240.30]  And then be
[4240.30 --> 4241.60]  prepared that
[4241.60 --> 4242.22]  the one who
[4242.22 --> 4243.02]  comforts us,
[4243.04 --> 4243.72]  as I believe
[4243.72 --> 4244.24]  Chris was
[4244.24 --> 4245.24]  talking about
[4245.24 --> 4245.98]  last week,
[4246.06 --> 4246.56]  the one who
[4246.56 --> 4247.46]  comforts us
[4247.46 --> 4248.28]  and gives
[4248.28 --> 4249.22]  rest is also
[4249.22 --> 4250.12]  the one who
[4250.12 --> 4250.80]  will then lead
[4250.80 --> 4251.72]  us out of
[4251.72 --> 4252.62]  our comfort
[4252.62 --> 4254.16]  zone to
[4254.16 --> 4254.94]  help others
[4254.94 --> 4255.78]  in their
[4255.78 --> 4256.24]  time of
[4256.24 --> 4256.52]  need.
[4257.80 --> 4258.46]  And when
[4258.46 --> 4259.18]  we accept
[4259.18 --> 4259.90]  a task
[4259.90 --> 4261.18]  from Jesus,
[4262.50 --> 4263.56]  it will be
[4263.56 --> 4264.26]  something that
[4264.26 --> 4264.66]  we will
[4264.66 --> 4265.12]  wear,
[4265.52 --> 4265.92]  but it
[4265.92 --> 4266.70]  won't wear
[4266.70 --> 4267.24]  us out.
[4268.50 --> 4269.12]  We may
[4269.12 --> 4269.78]  get tired,
[4270.24 --> 4270.76]  it's okay,
[4271.20 --> 4271.58]  there's a
[4271.58 --> 4273.46]  good tiredness,
[4273.64 --> 4274.02]  but not,
[4275.00 --> 4275.74]  Jesus doesn't
[4275.74 --> 4276.22]  want us to
[4276.22 --> 4276.64]  have this
[4276.64 --> 4277.72]  frustrating
[4277.72 --> 4279.00]  weariness that
[4279.00 --> 4280.00]  makes us want
[4280.00 --> 4281.18]  to quit.
[4282.64 --> 4283.36]  In Him,
[4283.42 --> 4283.82]  we will be
[4283.82 --> 4284.52]  at peace.
[4286.20 --> 4286.66]  So let me
[4286.66 --> 4287.20]  ask,
[4287.20 --> 4289.32]  is what
[4289.32 --> 4290.14]  you're carrying
[4290.14 --> 4291.00]  right now
[4291.00 --> 4294.20]  something that
[4294.20 --> 4295.32]  you have
[4295.32 --> 4296.06]  picked up
[4296.06 --> 4297.28]  or that
[4297.28 --> 4297.84]  the Lord
[4297.84 --> 4298.40]  has given
[4298.40 --> 4299.14]  to you?
[4300.50 --> 4301.46]  His yoke.
[4303.50 --> 4304.48]  It's not
[4304.48 --> 4305.16]  always easy
[4305.16 --> 4305.72]  to know.
[4307.10 --> 4307.62]  It takes
[4307.62 --> 4308.42]  practice,
[4308.54 --> 4308.90]  really,
[4309.78 --> 4310.94]  to know
[4310.94 --> 4311.58]  whether or
[4311.58 --> 4312.64]  not we
[4312.64 --> 4313.68]  are responding
[4313.68 --> 4314.80]  in the
[4314.80 --> 4315.42]  moment to
[4315.42 --> 4316.00]  the Spirit
[4316.00 --> 4316.70]  of Jesus
[4316.70 --> 4318.84]  or to
[4318.84 --> 4319.50]  the power
[4319.50 --> 4319.84]  of our
[4319.84 --> 4320.56]  own flesh
[4320.56 --> 4321.14]  that simply
[4321.14 --> 4321.90]  wants to
[4321.90 --> 4322.62]  do something.
[4324.62 --> 4325.38]  So it's
[4325.38 --> 4326.02]  helpful to
[4326.02 --> 4327.50]  ask yourself
[4327.50 --> 4327.92]  that.
[4329.26 --> 4330.56]  And these
[4330.56 --> 4331.06]  kinds of
[4331.06 --> 4331.70]  questions may
[4331.70 --> 4332.56]  help also to
[4332.56 --> 4332.96]  know whether
[4332.96 --> 4333.66]  it's the yoke
[4333.66 --> 4334.26]  of the Lord.
[4335.76 --> 4336.30]  Does this,
[4336.68 --> 4337.34]  what I'm
[4337.34 --> 4338.56]  being asked
[4338.56 --> 4339.12]  to do or
[4339.12 --> 4339.58]  doing,
[4339.94 --> 4340.42]  does it
[4340.42 --> 4342.04]  actually bring
[4342.04 --> 4342.56]  me in
[4342.56 --> 4342.96]  closer
[4342.96 --> 4343.76]  relationship
[4343.76 --> 4344.26]  to the
[4344.26 --> 4344.64]  Lord?
[4346.04 --> 4346.82]  Or more
[4346.82 --> 4347.20]  distant?
[4348.54 --> 4349.28]  Is it
[4349.28 --> 4349.80]  benefiting
[4349.80 --> 4351.48]  others and
[4351.48 --> 4352.20]  that way
[4352.20 --> 4352.98]  building up
[4352.98 --> 4353.52]  the kingdom?
[4355.22 --> 4356.06]  Is it in
[4356.06 --> 4356.44]  line with
[4356.44 --> 4356.94]  the Scriptures?
[4357.74 --> 4358.26]  If we are
[4358.26 --> 4358.96]  not students
[4358.96 --> 4359.36]  of the
[4359.36 --> 4359.96]  Scriptures and
[4359.96 --> 4360.48]  reading it
[4360.48 --> 4360.98]  faithfully,
[4361.10 --> 4361.54]  it's often
[4361.54 --> 4362.18]  hard to know
[4362.18 --> 4362.76]  what's right.
[4363.84 --> 4364.56]  Does it
[4364.56 --> 4365.22]  fit with
[4365.22 --> 4365.90]  who God
[4365.90 --> 4367.56]  has molded
[4367.56 --> 4368.30]  me to be?
[4369.24 --> 4369.96]  And what
[4369.96 --> 4370.30]  am I
[4370.30 --> 4370.88]  trusted
[4370.88 --> 4371.48]  friends
[4371.48 --> 4373.14]  think of
[4373.14 --> 4373.50]  what I'm
[4373.50 --> 4374.14]  doing or
[4374.14 --> 4374.66]  about to
[4374.66 --> 4374.92]  do?
[4376.00 --> 4376.40]  Helpful
[4376.40 --> 4376.98]  questions.
[4378.88 --> 4379.58]  But more
[4379.58 --> 4380.08]  importantly,
[4380.24 --> 4380.64]  let's hear
[4380.64 --> 4381.44]  this invitation
[4381.44 --> 4382.10]  of Christ
[4382.10 --> 4382.52]  again,
[4382.64 --> 4382.90]  and I
[4382.90 --> 4383.32]  end with
[4383.32 --> 4383.64]  this.
[4384.00 --> 4384.46]  It's from
[4384.46 --> 4385.08]  the message.
[4386.66 --> 4387.06]  Are you
[4387.06 --> 4387.40]  tired?
[4389.58 --> 4390.14]  Worn
[4390.14 --> 4390.56]  out?
[4391.06 --> 4391.50]  Perhaps
[4391.50 --> 4392.34]  burned
[4392.34 --> 4392.78]  out on
[4392.78 --> 4393.22]  religion?
[4395.10 --> 4395.50]  Jesus
[4395.50 --> 4395.92]  says,
[4396.22 --> 4396.46]  come to
[4396.46 --> 4396.78]  me,
[4397.12 --> 4397.82]  get away
[4397.82 --> 4398.38]  with me,
[4398.48 --> 4398.80]  and you'll
[4398.80 --> 4399.52]  recover your
[4399.52 --> 4399.98]  life.
[4400.80 --> 4401.22]  I'll
[4401.22 --> 4401.64]  show you
[4401.64 --> 4402.02]  how to
[4402.02 --> 4402.92]  take a
[4402.92 --> 4403.48]  real
[4403.48 --> 4404.66]  rest.
[4405.54 --> 4405.84]  Walk
[4405.84 --> 4406.42]  with me
[4406.42 --> 4407.02]  and work
[4407.02 --> 4407.54]  with me.
[4407.98 --> 4408.34]  Watch
[4408.34 --> 4409.34]  how I
[4409.34 --> 4409.84]  do it.
[4410.56 --> 4410.92]  Learn
[4410.92 --> 4411.28]  the
[4411.28 --> 4412.64]  unforced
[4412.64 --> 4413.16]  rhythms
[4413.16 --> 4414.24]  of grace.
[4415.04 --> 4415.60]  I won't
[4415.60 --> 4416.54]  lay anything
[4416.54 --> 4417.56]  heavy or
[4417.56 --> 4418.14]  ill-fitting
[4418.14 --> 4419.04]  on you.
[4420.12 --> 4420.42]  Keep
[4420.42 --> 4420.92]  company
[4420.92 --> 4421.62]  with me
[4421.62 --> 4422.82]  and you'll
[4422.82 --> 4423.62]  learn to
[4423.62 --> 4424.50]  live freely
[4424.50 --> 4426.04]  and lightly.
[4426.04 --> 4427.80]  let's
[4427.80 --> 4428.10]  pray.
[4429.22 --> 4429.60]  Lord
[4429.60 --> 4429.94]  Jesus,
[4430.12 --> 4430.72]  help us
[4430.72 --> 4431.62]  to have
[4431.62 --> 4432.38]  ears for
[4432.38 --> 4432.78]  what you
[4432.78 --> 4433.46]  are saying
[4433.46 --> 4434.12]  to us
[4434.12 --> 4435.34]  through your
[4435.34 --> 4436.40]  Holy Spirit.
[4437.66 --> 4437.96]  In our
[4437.96 --> 4438.78]  pride and
[4438.78 --> 4440.08]  self-determination,
[4440.28 --> 4440.82]  we all too
[4440.82 --> 4442.04]  often will
[4442.04 --> 4442.74]  avoid you
[4442.74 --> 4443.88]  because we've
[4443.88 --> 4444.64]  been impressed
[4444.64 --> 4446.04]  by the offerings
[4446.04 --> 4446.88]  of our world
[4446.88 --> 4447.64]  and pursued
[4447.64 --> 4448.98]  our own
[4448.98 --> 4449.88]  plans.
[4450.78 --> 4451.40]  Help us,
[4451.40 --> 4451.80]  Jesus,
[4452.10 --> 4452.50]  to be
[4452.50 --> 4453.16]  humble
[4453.16 --> 4453.66]  enough
[4453.66 --> 4455.02]  to see
[4455.02 --> 4455.70]  your heart
[4455.70 --> 4457.00]  and quiet
[4457.00 --> 4457.48]  enough
[4457.48 --> 4458.74]  to hear
[4458.74 --> 4459.46]  your voice
[4459.46 --> 4460.92]  and give
[4460.92 --> 4461.38]  us a
[4461.38 --> 4462.22]  childlike
[4462.22 --> 4462.96]  willingness
[4462.96 --> 4464.66]  and adult
[4464.66 --> 4465.86]  like courage
[4465.86 --> 4466.72]  to do
[4466.72 --> 4467.80]  what you
[4467.80 --> 4468.78]  invite us
[4468.78 --> 4469.74]  to do.
[4470.76 --> 4471.38]  And as
[4471.38 --> 4472.12]  our restless
[4472.12 --> 4472.84]  spirits
[4472.84 --> 4473.54]  more and
[4473.54 --> 4474.98]  more find
[4474.98 --> 4476.02]  their rest
[4476.02 --> 4476.76]  in you,
[4477.50 --> 4478.14]  liberate
[4478.14 --> 4479.24]  us to
[4479.24 --> 4479.88]  serve you
[4479.88 --> 4480.86]  and others,
[4481.40 --> 4481.80]  in the
[4481.80 --> 4482.26]  power
[4482.26 --> 4483.22]  of your
[4483.22 --> 4483.70]  love,
[4484.12 --> 4484.52]  joy,
[4484.76 --> 4485.92]  and peace.
[4486.38 --> 4486.74]  And it's
[4486.74 --> 4487.04]  in your
[4487.04 --> 4487.40]  name,
[4487.60 --> 4488.22]  Lord Jesus,
[4488.44 --> 4489.16]  your powerful
[4489.16 --> 4489.60]  name,
[4489.98 --> 4490.52]  we ask
[4490.52 --> 4490.94]  this.
[4491.52 --> 4491.80]  Amen.
[4497.08 --> 4498.02]  In Christ
[4498.02 --> 4498.44]  alone,
[4499.48 --> 4500.26]  our hope
[4500.26 --> 4500.76]  is found
[4500.76 --> 4501.12]  in our
[4501.12 --> 4501.44]  rest.
[4501.70 --> 4501.98]  Let's
[4501.98 --> 4502.52]  rise as
[4502.52 --> 4502.94]  we sing.
[4511.40 --> 4520.52]  Christ
[4520.52 --> 4521.28]  alone,
[4521.28 --> 4523.22]  my hope
[4523.22 --> 4525.02]  is found,
[4525.02 --> 4526.48]  He is my
[4526.48 --> 4526.90]  light,
[4527.00 --> 4528.66]  my strength,
[4528.80 --> 4530.08]  my soul,
[4530.60 --> 4530.98]  His
[4530.98 --> 4531.64]  border
[4531.64 --> 4532.84]  stone,
[4533.38 --> 4534.34]  His solid
[4534.34 --> 4535.56]  crown,
[4535.56 --> 4536.88]  firm
[4536.88 --> 4537.34]  through the
[4537.34 --> 4537.78]  tears
[4537.78 --> 4538.20]  and
[4538.20 --> 4539.04]  stride
[4539.04 --> 4539.92]  and
[4539.92 --> 4540.88]  storm,
[4541.38 --> 4541.76]  what
[4541.76 --> 4542.28]  heights
[4542.28 --> 4544.04]  of love,
[4544.16 --> 4545.02]  what depths
[4545.02 --> 4546.38]  of peace,
[4546.74 --> 4547.78]  when fears
[4547.78 --> 4549.46]  are still
[4549.46 --> 4550.58]  with striving
[4550.58 --> 4551.92]  seas,
[4552.32 --> 4552.66]  my
[4552.66 --> 4554.10]  comforter,
[4554.90 --> 4555.36]  my
[4555.36 --> 4556.32]  all in
[4556.32 --> 4557.60]  all,
[4558.06 --> 4558.98]  here in the
[4558.98 --> 4559.86]  love of
[4559.86 --> 4561.18]  Christ
[4561.18 --> 4563.08]  thou stand.
[4573.08 --> 4574.66]  In Christ
[4574.66 --> 4575.80]  alone,
[4576.30 --> 4577.08]  new to
[4577.08 --> 4577.64]  God's
[4577.64 --> 4578.90]  flesh,
[4579.38 --> 4580.26]  fullness of
[4580.26 --> 4581.12]  God in
[4581.12 --> 4582.56]  helpless
[4582.56 --> 4583.76]  name,
[4584.20 --> 4584.58]  His
[4584.58 --> 4585.58]  spirit of
[4585.58 --> 4587.24]  love and
[4587.24 --> 4588.18]  righteousness,
[4589.70 --> 4590.50]  stormed
[4590.50 --> 4590.72]  the
[4590.72 --> 4591.44]  ones He
[4591.44 --> 4593.20]  came to
[4593.20 --> 4594.20]  save.
[4594.58 --> 4595.54]  Till on
