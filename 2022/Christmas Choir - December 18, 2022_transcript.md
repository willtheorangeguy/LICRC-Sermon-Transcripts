[60.00 --> 89.98]  Thank you.
[90.00 --> 119.98]  Thank you.
[120.00 --> 122.00]  Thank you.
[122.00 --> 127.00]  Thank you.
[127.00 --> 131.48]  Good evening.
[131.48 --> 133.48]  Good evening.
[133.48 --> 135.44]  Welcome to Langley Emanuel Church.
[135.44 --> 143.56]  We are so excited to have you all here and to host this evening of Christmas praise.
[144.12 --> 150.84]  If this is your first time here with us, we are really excited that you've joined us this evening.
[151.02 --> 151.82]  My name is Chris.
[152.02 --> 160.94]  I'm one of the pastors here, and I would love to connect with you and chat with you, and so you can grab me after the service.
[160.94 --> 163.26]  Really, there's a few people wearing name tags.
[163.36 --> 166.22]  You can grab any one of them and ask questions.
[167.58 --> 174.00]  We imagine there might be a few people yet trickling in, and so, for instance, there's someone over here who sees the person.
[174.10 --> 174.54]  There you go.
[174.54 --> 175.54]  Welcome.
[175.54 --> 175.70]  Welcome.
[175.70 --> 176.70]  Welcome.
[176.70 --> 181.74]  And as that happens, just be mindful that people might scoot in front or might find a spot there.
[182.26 --> 183.30]  We'll let that happen.
[183.98 --> 194.70]  This evening, we are celebrating Christmas, and we're going to do that following a sort of modified traditional English lessons and carol service.
[194.70 --> 202.26]  And so, there's parts where the choir will lead us, there's parts where you will be invited to sing, and there will be readings that happen throughout.
[202.42 --> 203.88]  And so, just follow along.
[204.20 --> 212.56]  You are in the hands of our conductor, Mark, and he will take us on a journey of worship and praise this Christmas season together.
[213.30 --> 219.30]  Before we begin, I'm going to open in prayer, and then we will start our time together.
[219.78 --> 222.80]  Would you join your heart with me as we come together in worship?
[224.70 --> 230.96]  Heavenly Father, we come before you on this Christmas season evening.
[230.96 --> 237.12]  In the midst of the darkness outside, we see the light here.
[238.86 --> 248.14]  As candles push back the darkness, may the coming of the Lord Jesus push back the darkness as well.
[248.14 --> 256.06]  Open our eyes and our hearts to encounter you, a living God, tonight.
[256.90 --> 266.52]  As we sing familiar songs, as we hear maybe some unfamiliar songs, we pray that in and through it all, you would be glorified.
[267.36 --> 275.02]  We give this evening to you in praise of you, our God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[275.02 --> 276.80]  In Jesus' name we pray.

[868.68 --> 885.30]  The days are coming, declared the Lord, when I will bring my people, Israel and Judah, back from captivity and restore them to the land I gave their ancestors to possess.
[885.30 --> 903.30]  In that day I will break the yoke off their necks and will tear off their bonds. No longer will foreigners enslave them. Instead, they will serve the Lord their God, David their king, whom I will raise up for them.
[903.30 --> 925.56]  So do not fear, O Jacob, my servant. Do not be dismayed, O Israel. I will surely save you out of a distant place, your descendants from the land of their exile. Jacob will again have peace and security, and no one will make him afraid. I am with you and will save you, declared the Lord.
[933.30 --> 959.30]  O God of Israel, who comes to serve us free.

[1006.38 --> 1014.56]  And the oath to the glory, and the good of the praise.
[1014.56 --> 1023.30]  With holiness and light to His face, to serve the whole world's place.

[1061.08 --> 1070.82]  The oath of obedience to the Lord, that we have sent to Him.
[1070.82 --> 1078.56]  The oath of obedience to the Lord, that we have sent to Him.
[1078.56 --> 1084.56]  The oath of obedience to the Lord, that we have sent to Him.

[1092.30 --> 1102.04]  The oath of obedience to the Lord, that we have sent to Him.
[1102.04 --> 1111.78]  The oath of obedience to the Lord, that we have sent to Him.
[1111.78 --> 1120.52]  The oath of obedience to the Lord, that we have sent to Him.
[1120.52 --> 1125.52]  The oath of obedience to the Lord, that we have sent to Him.
[1125.52 --> 1137.26]  The oath of obedience to the Lord, that we have sent to Him.
[1137.26 --> 1139.26]  The oath of obedience to the Lord, that we have sent to Him.
[1139.26 --> 1153.00]  The oath of obedience to the Lord, that we have sent to Him.
[1153.00 --> 1157.00]  The oath of obedience to the Lord, that we have sent to Him.
[1157.00 --> 1160.74]  The oath of obedience to the Lord, that we have sent to Him.
[1160.74 --> 1161.18]  The oath of obedience to the Lord, that we have sent to Him.
[1161.18 --> 1168.58]  In the sixth month of Elizabeth's pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee,
[1168.82 --> 1173.90]  to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David.
[1174.50 --> 1176.04]  The virgin's name was Mary.
[1180.00 --> 1181.88]  Do not be afraid.
[1182.08 --> 1182.38]  Who?
[1183.14 --> 1184.34]  Do not be afraid.
[1184.34 --> 1187.68]  You who are heavenly favored.
[1187.68 --> 1190.04]  The Lord is with you.
[1192.04 --> 1198.08]  Mary was greatly troubled at his words, and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.
[1198.66 --> 1200.30]  But the angel said to her,
[1201.42 --> 1205.42]  Do not be afraid, Mary.
[1205.98 --> 1211.68]  You have found favor with God.
[1211.68 --> 1224.44]  You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him the name Jesus.
[1224.44 --> 1233.04]  He will be great and will be called the son of the most high.
[1233.04 --> 1248.48]  The Lord God will give him the throne of his father, David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob.
[1248.88 --> 1252.70]  Forever his kingdom will never end.
[1252.70 --> 1257.84]  How can this be since I am a virgin?
[1257.84 --> 1265.70]  The Holy Spirit will come upon you.
[1266.12 --> 1272.30]  You and the power of the most high will overshadow you.
[1272.30 --> 1281.64]  So the Holy One to be born will be called the son of God.
[1281.64 --> 1291.66]  Even Elizabeth, your relative, is going to have a child in her old age.
[1291.66 --> 1311.84]  And she who was said to be born and barren, she is in her six months, where no word from God will forever fail.
[1311.84 --> 1316.20]  I am the Lord's servant.
[1316.60 --> 1318.56]  May your word to me be fulfilled.
[1320.76 --> 1326.50]  At that time, Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill, country of Judea,
[1326.92 --> 1330.20]  where she entered Zachariah's home and greeted Elizabeth.
[1331.12 --> 1335.28]  When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby was in her womb,
[1335.80 --> 1338.34]  and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
[1338.86 --> 1340.56]  In a loud voice, she explained,
[1341.84 --> 1347.38]  Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear.
[1349.00 --> 1355.14]  But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
[1355.14 --> 1360.34]  As soon as the sound of your greetings reached my ears,
[1360.82 --> 1366.18]  the baby in my womb leaped for joy.
[1366.18 --> 1376.80]  Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord would fulfill his promise to her.
[1378.16 --> 1380.28]  My soul glorifies the Lord.
[1396.18 --> 1415.34]  And we fall of innocence, carrying the Holy Prince.
[1415.34 --> 1416.98]  You are almost there.
[1416.98 --> 1417.96]  You're almost there.
[1418.72 --> 1421.82]  You're almost there.
[1422.62 --> 1429.40]  Mother of the living word, trusting in the voice you heard.
[1429.64 --> 1431.90]  We're almost there.
[1432.96 --> 1434.98]  We're almost there.
[1434.98 --> 1439.14]  You're almost there.
[1439.48 --> 1442.66]  The angels seek.
[1443.14 --> 1445.74]  Redemption's plan.
[1446.14 --> 1448.62]  Uncoding.
[1449.74 --> 1452.68]  All hope is in.
[1452.68 --> 1455.90]  The sun you'll bear.
[1456.26 --> 1460.72]  You're almost there.
[1464.98 --> 1470.16]  Hope before the willing heart.
[1470.18 --> 1473.36]  We're forsake to do your part.
[1473.50 --> 1475.24]  You're almost there.
[1476.46 --> 1479.56]  You're almost there.
[1479.56 --> 1483.56]  Trust the Father to provide.
[1483.76 --> 1486.74]  Bread of heaven from this time.
[1487.02 --> 1489.62]  You're almost there.
[1490.04 --> 1492.78]  You're almost there.
[1492.78 --> 1496.18]  You're almost there.
[1496.48 --> 1499.90]  The waiting ends.
[1500.32 --> 1505.78]  Delivering the life within.
[1505.78 --> 1508.78]  The answered prayer.
[1509.78 --> 1511.78]  Emmanuel.
[1513.40 --> 1517.78]  You're almost there.
[1517.78 --> 1518.78]  You're almost there.
[1518.78 --> 1521.78]  You're almost there.
[1521.78 --> 1522.78]  You're almost there.
[1522.78 --> 1524.78]  The journey ends.
[1524.78 --> 1530.78]  Where death will die and life begins.
[1530.78 --> 1533.78]  The answered prayer.
[1533.78 --> 1534.78]  The answer prayer.
[1534.78 --> 1535.78]  Emmanuel.
[1535.78 --> 1536.78]  Almost.
[1536.78 --> 1537.78]  Almost there.
[1537.78 --> 1544.68]  You're almost there.
[1544.78 --> 1548.98]  You are anyway.
[1548.98 --> 1553.38]  You're almost there.
[1555.28 --> 1556.88]  You're almost there.
[1556.88 --> 1579.26]  You're almost with the waiting end, delivering the life within.
[1579.26 --> 1591.14]  The answer prayer, Emmanuel, you're almost there.
[1591.88 --> 1604.72]  You're almost there, your journey ends, where death will die and life begins.
[1604.72 --> 1620.72]  The answer prayer, Emmanuel, you're almost there.
[1620.72 --> 1634.72]  The answer prayer, Emmanuel, you're almost there.
[1634.72 --> 1664.70]  The answer prayer, Emmanuel, you're almost there.
[1664.70 --> 1669.08]  He has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts.
[1669.52 --> 1673.10]  He has brought down rulers from their thrones, but has lifted up the humble.
[1673.68 --> 1677.76]  He has filled the hungry with good things, but has sent the rich away empty.
[1678.36 --> 1687.12]  He has helped his servant Israel, remembering to be merciful to Abraham and his descendants forever,
[1687.48 --> 1689.10]  just as he promised our ancestors.
[1689.10 --> 1695.10]  He has helped his servant Israel, remembering to be merciful to Abraham and his descendants forever,
[1695.10 --> 1696.10]  and has sent the rich away empty.
[1696.10 --> 1706.10]  He has helped his servant Israel, remembering to be merciful to Abraham and his descendants forever,
[1706.10 --> 1711.10]  and has sent the rich away empty.
[1711.10 --> 1725.10]  The Savior comes, the Savior promised all.
[1725.10 --> 1738.10]  Let every heart prepare to call, and every joy shall come.
[1738.10 --> 1751.10]  But the presence will release in Satan's body to know.
[1751.10 --> 1765.10]  The gates of cross before he burst, the iron fetters lead.
[1765.10 --> 1777.10]  He comes, the broken heart to mine, the moon bears gold to him.
[1777.10 --> 1789.10]  In that treasure, tell his grace, the great is the wonderful Lord.
[1789.10 --> 1801.10]  For that Hosanna's grace of peace, your crown shall proclaim.
[1801.10 --> 1813.10]  In that eternal gorgeous way, in glory thou may.
[1813.10 --> 1825.10]  In that eternal glory, in glory thou may.
[1825.10 --> 1827.10]  Amen.
[1827.10 --> 1829.10]  Amen.
[1829.10 --> 1831.10]  Amen.
[1831.10 --> 1833.10]  Amen.
[1833.10 --> 1839.10]  A voice of one calling, in the wilderness prepare the way for the Lord.
[1839.10 --> 1842.10]  Make straight in the desert a highway for our God.
[1842.10 --> 1846.10]  Every valley shall be raised up.
[1846.10 --> 1848.10]  Every mountain and hill made low.
[1848.10 --> 1850.10]  The rough places of plain.
[1850.10 --> 1853.10]  The glory of the Lord will be revealed.
[1853.10 --> 1856.10]  And all the people will see it together.
[1856.10 --> 1859.10]  For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.
[1859.10 --> 1862.10]  A voice says, cry out.
[1862.10 --> 1864.10]  And I said, what shall I cry?
[1864.10 --> 1865.10]  All people are like grass.
[1865.10 --> 1869.10]  And their faithfulness is like the flowers of a field.
[1869.10 --> 1874.10]  Their grass withers and the flowers fall because the breath of the Lord blows on them.
[1874.10 --> 1876.10]  Surely the people are grass.
[1876.10 --> 1882.10]  Their grass withers and the flowers fall, but the word of the Lord endures forever.
[1882.10 --> 1888.10]  You who bring good tidings to Zion, go up on a high mountain.
[1888.10 --> 1893.10]  You who bring good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up your voice with a shout.
[1893.10 --> 1894.10]  Lift it up.
[1894.10 --> 1895.10]  Do not be afraid.
[1895.10 --> 1900.10]  Say to the towns of Judah, here is your God.
[1902.10 --> 1907.10]  See the sovereign Lord comes with power, and he rules with a mighty arm.
[1907.10 --> 1911.10]  See his reward is with him, and his recompense accompanies him.
[1911.10 --> 1913.10]  He tends to his flock like a shepherd.
[1913.10 --> 1917.10]  He gathers the lambs in his arms, and carries them close to his heart.
[1917.10 --> 1919.10]  He leads those that have young.
[1941.10 --> 1946.10]  He leads those 알 2007-го Treasure Island habíafigure
[1946.10 --> 1949.10]  Lots of collaborators from all America to live in Egypt, and brings children through the glass.
[1949.10 --> 1950.10]  Same time.
[1950.10 --> 1952.10]  You who prescribing God came.
[1952.10 --> 1958.74]  Let's get to the거� Kraut made of the
[1959.10 --> 1963.10]  Museum from beautiful Gain.

[2008.04 --> 2014.04]  of faith rise up and sing of the great and glorious
[2014.04 --> 2028.04]  way you are strong when you feel weak in your brokenness
[2028.04 --> 2042.04]  and the west
[2044.04 --> 2052.12]  come
[2055.24 --> 2058.04]  of

[2064.26 --> 2068.06]  Sing to the east and the west
[2068.06 --> 2071.96]  Jesus is Savior to all
[2071.96 --> 2075.56]  Lord of heaven and earth
[2075.56 --> 2079.30]  Shout to the north and the south
[2079.30 --> 2083.06]  Sing to the east and the west
[2083.06 --> 2087.02]  Jesus is Savior to all
[2087.02 --> 2094.44]  Lord of heaven and earth
[2094.44 --> 2100.00]  Prepare ye the way, the way of the Lord
[2100.00 --> 2107.68]  Prepare ye the way, the way of the Lord
[2107.68 --> 2113.50]  Prepare ye the way, the way of the Lord
[2117.02 --> 2142.12]  We mentioned at the beginning of our time together
[2142.12 --> 2146.62]  that this service is shaped on a traditional English lessons
[2146.62 --> 2147.78]  and carols service.
[2148.58 --> 2152.98]  And I was struck just now reflecting on the different family traditions
[2152.98 --> 2155.52]  that exist around Christmas time
[2155.52 --> 2160.64]  or the songs that some of us so quickly and readily associate with Christmas.
[2160.86 --> 2164.60]  Maybe we have sung them already tonight or we will yet.
[2166.34 --> 2169.36]  And the different ways that those traditions
[2169.36 --> 2174.50]  or the different ways that different things communicate those traditions.
[2174.50 --> 2178.48]  My son, who is seven, just leaned over to Rachel and I.
[2178.58 --> 2181.86]  He said, oh, that music sounds like the carousel
[2181.86 --> 2184.70]  because the organ was playing.
[2184.90 --> 2189.66]  And he associates the organ with a carousel that we used to have near our house.
[2190.18 --> 2193.46]  But some of you are like, oh, this music finally sounds like heaven
[2193.46 --> 2195.26]  because the organ is playing.
[2195.52 --> 2196.90]  And that's what you associate.
[2196.90 --> 2200.70]  We all have different traditions around these things.
[2201.96 --> 2206.14]  One of the traditions as well that so many people have
[2206.14 --> 2211.60]  is watching Christmas movies or reading Christmas stories together.
[2212.04 --> 2214.04]  Again, my kids just watched Elf.
[2214.14 --> 2217.86]  That has become a Christmas tradition for some people.
[2217.86 --> 2222.42]  Another Christmas tradition is the story,
[2222.66 --> 2225.98]  A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens.
[2226.46 --> 2227.80]  If you're familiar with that story
[2227.80 --> 2231.12]  or with one of the many ways that story has been retold
[2231.12 --> 2232.78]  in the past little while.
[2233.04 --> 2234.60]  In fact, there's even a new one
[2234.60 --> 2237.46]  with Ryan Reynolds and Will Ferrell, Spirited,
[2237.56 --> 2238.66]  that's about that as well.
[2239.14 --> 2242.36]  It is a story about a man named Scrooge,
[2242.46 --> 2243.72]  Ebenezer Scrooge,
[2243.72 --> 2249.40]  who is visited by the ghost of his former business partner
[2249.40 --> 2255.94]  and then by three ghosts or spirits or phantoms or phantasms,
[2256.04 --> 2257.18]  if you read it in the original,
[2257.66 --> 2260.52]  of Christmas past, Christmas present,
[2261.02 --> 2262.88]  and Christmas yet to come.
[2263.92 --> 2266.52]  Now, Scrooge, you know the story, right,
[2266.56 --> 2268.26]  is a curmudgeonly old man
[2268.26 --> 2272.30]  and A Christmas Carol is his journey of change.
[2272.30 --> 2275.58]  So the first ghost appears to him
[2275.58 --> 2278.24]  and is the ghost of Christmas past
[2278.24 --> 2280.76]  and takes him into his past.
[2281.36 --> 2284.50]  A time before he was corrupted
[2284.50 --> 2286.94]  by all the trappings of wealth and business
[2286.94 --> 2289.52]  that had turned him into the man that he was.
[2289.96 --> 2292.46]  And when he sees his past
[2292.46 --> 2294.46]  and the good circumstances
[2294.46 --> 2296.80]  and the good people of his past,
[2297.02 --> 2301.30]  it actually functions for him like an accusation, right?
[2301.30 --> 2303.58]  It's a voice of accusation
[2303.58 --> 2305.54]  against the man that he had become.
[2306.26 --> 2309.56]  And the weight of that accusing past
[2309.56 --> 2313.56]  presses so heavily down on him
[2313.56 --> 2315.24]  that he gets really angry
[2315.24 --> 2316.88]  at the ghost of Christmas past
[2316.88 --> 2319.02]  and demands that the spirit take him
[2319.02 --> 2320.66]  back to his house,
[2321.46 --> 2322.10]  to his bed.
[2322.10 --> 2326.20]  What interests me tonight
[2326.20 --> 2327.92]  is the second spirit,
[2328.60 --> 2329.88]  the ghost of Christmas present
[2329.88 --> 2331.66]  that appears to him.
[2332.68 --> 2335.54]  Now, this ghost of Christmas present,
[2335.76 --> 2337.36]  the way Dickens writes it,
[2338.06 --> 2341.78]  is a jolly giant, glorious to see.
[2342.44 --> 2344.54]  His eyes were clear and kind.
[2345.42 --> 2346.48]  His feet are bare,
[2346.58 --> 2348.62]  and then I love the way he writes this.
[2348.62 --> 2349.62]  He says,
[2350.20 --> 2352.46]  its capacious chest was bare
[2352.46 --> 2354.84]  as if disdaining to be warded
[2354.84 --> 2357.02]  or concealed by any artifice.
[2358.32 --> 2359.54]  And I think what that means
[2359.54 --> 2360.48]  is that his heart,
[2360.66 --> 2362.16]  or the ghost's heart,
[2362.30 --> 2364.48]  is on display for all to see
[2364.48 --> 2366.48]  and that there is a generous love
[2366.48 --> 2367.72]  that is just oozing out,
[2367.82 --> 2369.34]  that is unwilling to be guarded
[2369.34 --> 2371.12]  or unwilling to be hid away.
[2372.64 --> 2374.06]  Dickens goes on, he says,
[2374.06 --> 2376.78]  on its head it wore no other covering
[2376.78 --> 2378.26]  than a holly wreath
[2378.26 --> 2379.90]  set here and there
[2379.90 --> 2381.76]  with shining icicles.
[2382.44 --> 2384.06]  It's a sort of Christmas crown
[2384.06 --> 2386.02]  that sits upon its head.
[2386.12 --> 2386.84]  And then finally,
[2387.44 --> 2388.94]  girded round its middle
[2388.94 --> 2390.98]  was an antique scabbard.
[2391.38 --> 2392.92]  It's a sword sheath.
[2393.42 --> 2395.00]  But no sword was in it,
[2395.38 --> 2396.60]  and the ancient sheath
[2396.60 --> 2399.04]  was eaten up with rust.
[2399.04 --> 2402.42]  Now, I love this description
[2402.42 --> 2404.52]  of the ghost of Christmas present
[2404.52 --> 2406.44]  because I can't but help
[2406.44 --> 2409.70]  but hear something of Jesus within it.
[2410.42 --> 2410.56]  Right?
[2410.68 --> 2414.66]  Jesus, who is himself glorious to see.
[2415.48 --> 2417.84]  John says in chapter 1,
[2419.20 --> 2419.50]  says,
[2419.66 --> 2422.26]  we have seen his glory,
[2422.40 --> 2424.66]  the glory of the one and only Son
[2424.66 --> 2426.04]  who came from the Father
[2426.04 --> 2428.88]  full of grace and truth.
[2429.04 --> 2432.58]  Jesus,
[2433.30 --> 2434.72]  whose eyes
[2434.72 --> 2438.24]  look into prostitutes,
[2438.78 --> 2440.12]  into outcasts,
[2440.28 --> 2442.70]  into sinners and rejects,
[2443.70 --> 2446.36]  and as they look into his eyes,
[2446.50 --> 2447.16]  they see
[2447.16 --> 2448.94]  a love
[2448.94 --> 2450.52]  and a heart
[2450.52 --> 2451.80]  for them.
[2452.56 --> 2453.62]  Jesus, whose heart
[2453.62 --> 2455.66]  was open to welcoming children,
[2455.76 --> 2456.74]  even though there were people
[2456.74 --> 2457.76]  actively in his life
[2457.76 --> 2459.14]  trying to push them away
[2459.14 --> 2460.28]  and keep them separated.
[2460.70 --> 2461.46]  Jesus, too,
[2461.60 --> 2462.66]  who is crowned
[2462.66 --> 2463.70]  with glory
[2463.70 --> 2464.76]  and honor.
[2465.58 --> 2466.44]  Here at Emmanuel,
[2466.62 --> 2467.40]  we are looking
[2467.40 --> 2468.64]  in the book of Revelation
[2468.64 --> 2469.48]  throughout Advent
[2469.48 --> 2470.02]  and Christmas,
[2470.18 --> 2471.02]  and there's a text
[2471.02 --> 2472.52]  in Revelation 14,
[2472.80 --> 2473.46]  verse 14,
[2473.56 --> 2473.78]  that says,
[2473.86 --> 2474.28]  I looked,
[2474.40 --> 2475.30]  and there before me
[2475.30 --> 2476.26]  was a white cloud,
[2476.56 --> 2477.72]  and seated on the cloud
[2477.72 --> 2479.54]  was one like the Son of Man
[2479.54 --> 2481.04]  with a crown of gold
[2481.04 --> 2482.16]  on his head.
[2482.16 --> 2483.76]  Now,
[2483.88 --> 2484.60]  let me be clear,
[2484.74 --> 2485.82]  I'm not trying to say
[2485.82 --> 2486.82]  that Dickens
[2486.82 --> 2488.42]  is saying
[2488.42 --> 2489.14]  that there is a
[2489.14 --> 2490.48]  one-to-one correspondence
[2490.48 --> 2491.24]  with the ghost
[2491.24 --> 2492.58]  of Christmas present
[2492.58 --> 2494.12]  or the spirit
[2494.12 --> 2495.20]  and Jesus,
[2495.20 --> 2496.30]  but there is something
[2496.30 --> 2497.64]  of an allegory here.
[2498.04 --> 2498.18]  Now,
[2498.22 --> 2498.90]  literary critics
[2498.90 --> 2499.94]  and scholars alike
[2499.94 --> 2500.52]  have debated
[2500.52 --> 2501.32]  back and forth,
[2501.38 --> 2502.04]  and I'm not interested
[2502.04 --> 2503.28]  in getting into that,
[2503.34 --> 2504.46]  but there is a sense,
[2504.94 --> 2506.18]  I think you can hear it,
[2506.54 --> 2507.30]  a sense
[2507.30 --> 2509.58]  in that Dickens
[2509.58 --> 2510.74]  is trying to convey
[2510.74 --> 2512.90]  a sense of the connection
[2512.90 --> 2513.88]  of Christmas
[2513.88 --> 2516.18]  to its namesake.
[2516.80 --> 2517.50]  That is the connection
[2517.50 --> 2518.26]  of the celebration
[2518.26 --> 2519.12]  of Christmas
[2519.12 --> 2520.64]  to Christ.
[2521.90 --> 2522.62]  And when Dickens
[2522.62 --> 2523.16]  is writing
[2523.16 --> 2524.78]  in the mid-19th century,
[2525.46 --> 2526.86]  there's a bit of a revival
[2526.86 --> 2527.60]  that's happening
[2527.60 --> 2528.88]  in England,
[2529.18 --> 2531.06]  a period of discernment.
[2531.94 --> 2532.68]  Some have called it
[2532.68 --> 2535.96]  a mid-Victorian revival
[2535.96 --> 2536.82]  of the Christmas
[2536.82 --> 2537.70]  holiday.
[2539.56 --> 2540.50]  And as he writes
[2540.50 --> 2542.52]  and Dickens puts
[2542.52 --> 2543.86]  on Scrooge lips,
[2544.36 --> 2545.76]  he asks the spirit
[2545.76 --> 2546.90]  of Christmas present
[2546.90 --> 2548.12]  how many brothers
[2548.12 --> 2548.88]  he has,
[2549.22 --> 2549.88]  and the spirit
[2549.88 --> 2550.74]  answers him
[2550.74 --> 2551.32]  by saying
[2551.32 --> 2552.56]  he has more
[2552.56 --> 2554.66]  than 1,800 brothers.
[2555.26 --> 2555.56]  Again,
[2555.68 --> 2556.34]  A Christmas Carol
[2556.34 --> 2557.08]  was published
[2557.08 --> 2558.78]  in 1843.
[2559.78 --> 2560.30]  So how many
[2560.30 --> 2561.46]  Christmas presents
[2561.46 --> 2562.80]  would there have been
[2562.80 --> 2564.66]  from that first one
[2564.66 --> 2565.50]  in the manger?
[2566.82 --> 2568.56]  Some 1,800 or so.
[2569.70 --> 2570.16]  Right?
[2570.20 --> 2570.78]  I think there's
[2570.78 --> 2572.36]  an analogy.
[2573.60 --> 2574.54]  Now one of the things
[2574.54 --> 2575.98]  that this Christmas
[2575.98 --> 2577.42]  spirit does
[2577.42 --> 2578.52]  is take Scrooge
[2578.52 --> 2579.78]  around to people
[2579.78 --> 2580.48]  who have
[2580.48 --> 2582.18]  obviously less
[2582.18 --> 2583.30]  than he does.
[2583.84 --> 2584.58]  And so for instance,
[2584.70 --> 2586.06]  they go to the home
[2586.06 --> 2586.66]  and family
[2586.66 --> 2587.76]  of Bob Cratchit
[2587.76 --> 2589.14]  who works for Scrooge.
[2589.28 --> 2590.22]  And that's where we meet
[2590.22 --> 2591.38]  the famous Tiny Tim.
[2592.56 --> 2592.82]  Right?
[2592.82 --> 2593.34]  Then they move
[2593.34 --> 2593.72]  from there
[2593.72 --> 2594.82]  to a miner's cottage
[2594.82 --> 2596.04]  and to a lighthouse keeper
[2596.04 --> 2597.22]  and to a ship at sea.
[2597.86 --> 2598.96]  And they see
[2598.96 --> 2600.00]  and observe people
[2600.00 --> 2600.90]  all of whom
[2600.90 --> 2603.56]  have way less
[2603.56 --> 2604.50]  than Scrooge
[2604.50 --> 2605.66]  and by Scrooge's
[2605.66 --> 2607.00]  own view of the world
[2607.00 --> 2608.58]  should not be happy,
[2608.96 --> 2610.24]  should not be content,
[2610.72 --> 2611.40]  and yet
[2611.40 --> 2613.14]  they are.
[2614.06 --> 2614.24]  Right?
[2614.26 --> 2614.84]  There's a sense
[2614.84 --> 2615.56]  of peace
[2615.56 --> 2617.04]  and contentment
[2617.04 --> 2618.32]  that is compelling
[2618.32 --> 2619.58]  to Scrooge,
[2619.78 --> 2620.82]  although in that moment
[2620.82 --> 2623.08]  yet he doesn't quite understand.
[2624.26 --> 2625.66]  That sense of contentment
[2625.66 --> 2627.50]  comes from the peace
[2627.50 --> 2628.82]  that they have.
[2629.90 --> 2630.66]  And so in the hustle
[2630.66 --> 2632.36]  and bustle of Christmas
[2632.36 --> 2634.34]  and as things become
[2634.34 --> 2635.38]  so busy
[2635.38 --> 2636.36]  this time of year
[2636.36 --> 2637.98]  for so many of us
[2637.98 --> 2639.10]  moving from one place
[2639.10 --> 2639.70]  to another,
[2639.80 --> 2640.98]  it's so easy
[2640.98 --> 2642.34]  to lose sense
[2642.34 --> 2643.46]  and sight
[2643.46 --> 2644.98]  of that peace.
[2646.20 --> 2646.84]  Now I believe
[2646.84 --> 2647.84]  that we are all hungry
[2647.84 --> 2648.48]  for it.
[2649.20 --> 2649.34]  Right?
[2649.40 --> 2649.68]  Remember
[2649.68 --> 2650.52]  the description
[2650.52 --> 2651.86]  of Christmas present,
[2651.96 --> 2653.08]  the ghost of Christmas present?
[2653.48 --> 2654.64]  Girded round its middle
[2654.64 --> 2655.90]  was an antique scabbard
[2655.90 --> 2656.72]  but no sword
[2656.72 --> 2657.26]  was in it
[2657.26 --> 2658.46]  and the ancient sheath
[2658.46 --> 2659.46]  was eaten up
[2659.46 --> 2660.54]  with rust.
[2661.60 --> 2662.54]  There is a peace
[2662.54 --> 2664.04]  that comes at Christmas
[2664.04 --> 2665.42]  that makes
[2665.42 --> 2666.36]  swords
[2666.36 --> 2667.62]  unnecessary.
[2668.62 --> 2670.14]  A sense of peace
[2670.14 --> 2671.30]  that only Jesus
[2671.30 --> 2672.60]  can bring.
[2673.70 --> 2674.50]  We've been reading
[2674.50 --> 2675.70]  from Isaiah.
[2676.18 --> 2676.96]  Isaiah 2
[2676.96 --> 2678.52]  we read,
[2678.52 --> 2679.66]  he will judge
[2679.66 --> 2680.62]  between the nations
[2680.62 --> 2681.20]  and will settle
[2681.20 --> 2682.60]  disputes for many peoples.
[2683.36 --> 2684.04]  They will beat
[2684.04 --> 2685.02]  their swords
[2685.02 --> 2686.24]  into plowshares
[2686.24 --> 2687.46]  and their spears
[2687.46 --> 2688.58]  into pruning hooks.
[2689.36 --> 2690.22]  Nation will not
[2690.22 --> 2690.90]  take up sword
[2690.90 --> 2691.56]  against nation
[2691.56 --> 2692.76]  nor will they train
[2692.76 --> 2693.50]  for war
[2693.50 --> 2694.66]  anymore.
[2695.66 --> 2697.06]  There's no longer
[2697.06 --> 2697.78]  a need
[2697.78 --> 2698.64]  for a sword
[2698.64 --> 2699.86]  so the sheath
[2699.86 --> 2700.96]  is covered over
[2700.96 --> 2702.14]  in rust.
[2703.14 --> 2704.00]  For to us
[2704.00 --> 2704.74]  a child
[2704.74 --> 2705.84]  is born.
[2706.76 --> 2707.26]  To us
[2707.26 --> 2707.86]  a son
[2707.86 --> 2708.48]  is given
[2708.48 --> 2709.18]  and the government
[2709.18 --> 2710.32]  will be on his
[2710.32 --> 2711.02]  shoulders
[2711.02 --> 2712.46]  and he will be called
[2712.46 --> 2714.40]  Wonderful Counselor
[2714.40 --> 2715.60]  Mighty God
[2715.60 --> 2717.38]  Everlasting Father
[2717.38 --> 2718.52]  Prince
[2718.52 --> 2720.08]  of Peace.
[2720.84 --> 2721.82]  Over the next
[2721.82 --> 2722.38]  week
[2722.38 --> 2723.00]  over the next
[2723.00 --> 2723.88]  few weeks
[2723.88 --> 2724.96]  our prayer
[2724.96 --> 2725.80]  my prayer
[2725.80 --> 2726.36]  for you
[2726.36 --> 2727.04]  is that you
[2727.04 --> 2727.78]  would know
[2727.78 --> 2728.70]  the peace
[2728.70 --> 2730.00]  of Jesus
[2730.00 --> 2731.54]  this Christmas.
[2731.54 --> 2733.26]  hopefully it
[2733.26 --> 2733.74]  doesn't take
[2733.74 --> 2734.30]  the appearance
[2734.30 --> 2734.92]  of a ghost
[2734.92 --> 2736.16]  to help you
[2736.16 --> 2736.66]  find it
[2736.66 --> 2738.72]  but I pray
[2738.72 --> 2739.80]  that you do
[2739.80 --> 2741.16]  and that you
[2741.16 --> 2741.80]  would know
[2741.80 --> 2743.52]  this peace
[2743.52 --> 2744.92]  the only
[2744.92 --> 2745.86]  true peace
[2745.86 --> 2746.92]  that surpasses
[2746.92 --> 2747.48]  all
[2747.48 --> 2748.96]  understanding.
[2750.16 --> 2750.44]  Amen?
[2751.44 --> 2752.04]  Amen.

[2911.30 --> 2913.30]  Amen.
[2941.30 --> 2943.30]  Amen.
[2971.30 --> 2986.68]  Jesus, leading up to Jesus' birth, Caesar Augustus issued a decree that census should be taken
[2986.68 --> 2993.62]  off the entire Roman world.
[2993.62 --> 2999.22]  And everyone went to his own town to register.
[2999.22 --> 3007.82]  So Joseph also went up to the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea,
[3007.94 --> 3013.30]  to Bethlehem, the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David.
[3013.68 --> 3020.82]  He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child.
[3022.82 --> 3027.54]  While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born.
[3029.22 --> 3033.82]  And she gave birth to her firstborn son.
[3034.90 --> 3042.62]  She wrapped him in clothes and placed him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn.
[3059.22 --> 3064.90]  And she gave birth to her firstborn son.
[3064.90 --> 3070.14]  She gave birth to her firstborn son.
[3070.14 --> 3072.86]  She gave birth to her firstborn son.
[3072.86 --> 3078.54]  She gave birth to her firstborn son.
[3078.54 --> 3081.22]  She gave birth to her firstborn son.
[3081.22 --> 3084.22]  She gave birth to her firstborn son.
[3084.22 --> 3086.90]  She gave birth to her firstborn son.
[3086.90 --> 3089.90]  She gave birth to her firstborn son.
[3089.90 --> 3105.50]  Did you know that your baby boy has come to make you new?
[3105.50 --> 3115.50]  This child that you deliver, who delivered?
[3115.50 --> 3127.50]  Did you know that your baby boy could die to have like that?
[3127.50 --> 3149.50]  Did you know that your baby boy has walked where angels drive?
[3149.50 --> 3161.50]  Did you kiss your little baby in the face of God?
[3161.50 --> 3181.50]  Did you hear that your baby boy could die?
[3181.50 --> 3194.50]  The blind will see, the deaf will hear, the deaf will live again.
[3194.50 --> 3208.50]  The lame will leave, the dumb will speak, the praise does go forever.
[3208.50 --> 3224.50]  Mary, did you know that Mary was born, this Lord of all creation?
[3224.50 --> 3235.50]  Mary, did you know that Mary was born, that one day ruled the nations?
[3235.50 --> 3246.50]  Did you know that your baby born was heaven's perfect land?
[3246.50 --> 3265.50]  The sleeping child you're holding is the great, the great of God.
[3265.50 --> 3285.50]  The sleeping child you're holding is the great, the great of God.
[3285.50 --> 3291.50]  And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night.
[3291.50 --> 3298.50]  An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.
[3298.50 --> 3305.50]  But the angel said to them, Do not be afraid, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all people.
[3305.50 --> 3309.50]  Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you, he is Christ the Lord.
[3309.50 --> 3315.50]  This will be a sign to you, you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.
[3315.50 --> 3322.50]  Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,
[3322.50 --> 3329.50]  Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.
[3329.50 --> 3349.50]  Glory to the new born King, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.
[3349.50 --> 3359.50]  Lord the heavenly angels sing, Glory to the new born King,
[3359.50 --> 3369.50]  He's on earth and mercy mild, God and sinners reconciled.

[3448.50 --> 3454.46]  Glory to the new born King
[3454.46 --> 3460.64]  From the heaven of the peace

[3471.06 --> 3475.50]  With the healing in his prayer

[3620.40 --> 3624.40]  Sing in exultation.
[3624.40 --> 3634.40]  Sing, holy spirit, our sins of the Lord above.
[3634.40 --> 3636.28]  Glory to God.
[3636.28 --> 3640.34]  Glory to God.
[3640.34 --> 3641.34]  Glory to God.

[3987.42 --> 3994.62]  Worship Christ the newborn King.
[3994.62 --> 4004.76]  When the angels had left them and gone into heaven,
[4005.10 --> 4007.04]  The shepherds said to one another,
[4007.84 --> 4011.56]  Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened,
[4011.88 --> 4013.58]  Which the Lord has told us.
[4013.58 --> 4021.94]  So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph and the baby who was lying in the manger.
[4022.88 --> 4024.48]  When they had seen him,
[4024.60 --> 4032.30]  They spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child.
[4032.30 --> 4039.44]  And all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them.
[4039.44 --> 4046.90]  But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart.
[4047.36 --> 4054.80]  The shepherds returned glory and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen,
[4054.80 --> 4059.02]  And the shepherds were just as they had been told.
[4059.02 --> 4089.00]  And the shepherds were just as they had been told.
[4089.02 --> 4096.16]  This is the night of the Lord's Savior's birth.
[4096.16 --> 4103.36]  O glorious night, the angel's cries are waking,
[4103.36 --> 4110.38]  Bringing the news of peace to all the earth.
[4110.38 --> 4117.36]  Rejoice, rejoice, this is our time for worship.
[4117.36 --> 4124.50]  Lift up your voice and tune your heart for praise.
