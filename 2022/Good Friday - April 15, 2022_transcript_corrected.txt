[0.00 → 9.36] I grant Him to die, I scarce can take it in
[9.36 → 18.90] That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing
[18.90 → 28.70] He bled and died to take away my sin
[28.70 → 39.70] Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee
[39.70 → 50.68] How great Thou art, how great Thou art
[50.68 → 60.68] Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee
[60.68 → 73.68] How great Thou art, how great Thou art
[73.68 → 97.16] When Christ shall come
[97.16 → 101.48] With shout of acclamation
[101.48 → 106.16] And take me home
[106.16 → 112.16] What joy shall fill my heart
[112.16 → 122.16] Then I shall bow in humble adoration
[122.16 → 132.16] And then proclaim, my God, how great Thou art
[132.16 → 143.16] Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee
[143.16 → 153.16] How great Thou art, how great Thou art
[153.16 → 166.16] How great Thou art, how great Thou art
[166.16 → 170.16] How great Thou art, how great Thou art
[170.16 → 183.16] How great Thou art, how great Thou art
[183.16 → 185.16] How great Thou art
[185.16 → 189.16] How great Thou art
[189.16 → 192.16] Now ti'she lay their own
[192.16 → 202.16] Thou art, how great Thou art
[202.16 → 202.76] Praise Him.

[230.46 → 237.46] One with God, the Lord Most High.

[291.44 → 296.44] So Jesus, you brought heaven down.
[296.44 → 304.28] My sin was great, Your love was greater
[304.28 → 311.48] What could separate us now?
[311.48 → 314.94] What a wonderful name it is
[314.94 → 318.40] What a wonderful name it is

[386.64 → 389.80] We love to sing who you are
[389.80 → 392.76] Death could not hold you
[392.76 → 396.76] The veil tore before you
[396.76 → 403.76] You silenced the boast of sin and breaking
[403.76 → 407.26] The heavens are roaring
[407.26 → 410.76] The praise of your glory
[410.76 → 416.72] For you are raised to life again

[928.48 → 934.90] Thank you for joining us for our Good Friday worship service together.
[935.48 → 941.50] We gather tonight to remember the life and the death of Christ.
[941.50 → 951.38] We gather tonight to reflect on what that death means for us as his church and in this community today.
[951.58 → 959.58] That event 2,000 years ago changes everything about how we live our lives today.
[959.76 → 969.18] And so we gather to remember and to reflect, to worship, and then to be sent out in the power of the cross.
[969.18 → 973.40] If you're visiting with us this evening, a special welcome to you.
[973.52 → 975.72] My name is Chris. I'm one of the pastors here.
[975.92 → 982.72] And along with these others and a few more yet on stage, it's my privilege to lead you in worship.
[983.16 → 991.26] I'm going to ask if you are able and where you are to stand, we can be called together into the presence of God and welcomed by him here.
[991.26 → 997.00] Receive the greeting of our God on this Good Friday.
[998.00 → 1009.30] Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father through the death of Jesus Christ, his Son,
[1009.30 → 1013.12] by the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[1014.16 → 1014.56] Amen.

[1066.80 → 1067.16] Amen.
[1067.16 → 1070.40] Jesus' name.
[1074.40 → 1080.88] Silent as he stood accused,
[1081.46 → 1087.16] beaten, mocked, and scorned.
[1088.38 → 1094.40] Bowing to the Father's will,
[1094.40 → 1100.86] he took a crown of thorns.
[1101.40 → 1107.48] Oh, that rugged cross, my salvation,
[1108.28 → 1113.56] where your love poured out over me.
[1115.18 → 1118.46] Now my soul cries out,
[1118.46 → 1119.84] Hallelujah!
[1119.84 → 1127.98] Praise and honour unto thee.
[1132.98 → 1138.84] Sends of heaven, God's own song,
[1138.84 → 1144.98] to purchase and redeem,
[1146.98 → 1153.28] and reconcile the very ones
[1153.28 → 1158.98] who nailed him to that tree.
[1158.98 → 1166.24] Oh, that rugged cross, my salvation,
[1167.12 → 1172.98] where your love poured out over me.
[1173.72 → 1177.18] Now my soul cries out,
[1177.46 → 1178.98] Hallelujah!
[1180.98 → 1185.98] Praise and honour unto thee.
[1185.98 → 1187.98] Praise and honour unto thee.
[1187.98 → 1192.12] Oh, that rugged cross, my salvation,
[1192.12 → 1200.12] where your love poured out over me.
[1200.12 → 1204.54] Now my soul cries out,
[1204.90 → 1206.12] Hallelujah!
[1208.24 → 1213.12] Praise and honour unto thee.
[1213.12 → 1220.12] Praise and honour unto thee.
[1220.12 → 1221.26] Praise and honour unto thee.
[1226.26 → 1228.40] From Isaiah 53.
[1228.40 → 1235.96] He was despised and rejected by man,
[1237.40 → 1240.48] a man of suffering and familiar with pain.
[1241.84 → 1244.68] Like one from whom people hide their faces,
[1244.92 → 1245.88] he was despised,
[1246.40 → 1249.08] and we held him in low esteem.
[1250.98 → 1253.82] Surely he took up our pain and bore our suffering,
[1253.82 → 1257.00] yet we considered him punished by God,
[1257.58 → 1258.46] stricken by him,
[1258.94 → 1259.60] and afflicted.
[1261.00 → 1264.16] But he was pierced for our transgressions.
[1264.32 → 1267.10] He was crushed for our iniquities.
[1268.04 → 1272.42] The punishment that brought us peace was on him,
[1272.98 → 1275.32] and by his wounds we are healed.
[1275.32 → 1279.74] We all, like sheep, have gone astray.
[1280.08 → 1282.38] Each of us has turned to our own way,
[1283.00 → 1286.10] and the Lord has laid on him
[1286.10 → 1288.88] the iniquity of us all.
[1288.88 → 1291.42] simmer play with singing.
[1291.42 → 1321.40] piano plays softly
[1321.42 → 1351.40] piano plays softly
[1351.42 → 1381.40] piano plays softly
[1381.42 → 1388.54] Oh, praise the name of the Lord our God.
[1388.94 → 1395.46] Oh, praise His name forevermore.
[1395.86 → 1402.42] For endless days we will sing Your praise.
[1402.42 → 1408.54] Oh, Lord, oh, Lord our God.
[1408.54 → 1416.16] Oh, praise the name of the Lord our God.
[1416.16 → 1423.00] Oh, praise His name forevermore.
[1423.28 → 1430.04] For endless days we will sing Your praise.
[1430.04 → 1436.16] Oh, Lord, oh, Lord our God.
[1436.16 → 1443.16] Oh, Lord, oh, Lord our God.
[1443.16 → 1448.96] Continuing in Isaiah 53.
[1448.96 → 1454.70] Yet it was the Lord's will to crush Him and cause Him to suffer.
[1455.66 → 1459.22] And though the Lord makes His life an offering for sin,
[1459.78 → 1463.04] He will see His offspring and prolong His days,
[1463.32 → 1466.48] and the will of the Lord will prosper in His hand.
[1467.94 → 1472.34] After He has suffered, He will see the light of life and be satisfied.
[1472.34 → 1476.92] By His knowledge, My righteous servant will justify many,
[1477.02 → 1478.54] and He will bear their iniquities.
[1479.50 → 1482.60] Therefore, I will give Him a portion among the great,
[1483.12 → 1485.64] and He will divide the spoils with the strong,
[1485.74 → 1488.20] because He poured out His life unto death
[1488.20 → 1490.72] and was numbered with the transgressors.
[1490.72 → 1493.14] For The bore the sin of many
[1493.14 → 1496.16] and made intercession for the transgressors.
[1496.16 → 1523.10] O sacred hand, now wounded,
[1523.10 → 1529.10] with grief and shame, with doubt,
[1530.48 → 1536.20] Thou scornfully surrounded,
[1536.20 → 1542.10] with warmth, Your only crown.
[1543.78 → 1550.02] O sacred hand, one glory,
[1550.02 → 1556.50] and blessing You have known.
[1556.50 → 1563.24] Yet though deep, spires and glory,
[1563.24 → 1569.84] I claim You as my own.
[1580.02 → 1589.62] My Lord, what You did suffer,
[1589.62 → 1596.26] Was all for sinners gave.
[1596.26 → 1603.04] Mine, mine was a transgression,
[1603.04 → 1609.52] But Yours, the deadly pain.
[1609.52 → 1616.96] So here I heal my Saviour,
[1616.96 → 1624.10] For I deserve Your place.
[1624.10 → 1631.10] Look on me with Your favour,
[1631.10 → 1638.10] And safely by Your grace.
[1638.10 → 1645.10] What language shall I borrow
[1645.10 → 1651.10] To make You, dearest friend,
[1651.10 → 1658.10] For this Your dying sorrow,
[1658.10 → 1665.10] Your mercy without end.
[1665.10 → 1672.10] Lord, make me yours forever
[1672.10 → 1678.10] A royal servant too
[1678.10 → 1685.10] And let me never, never
[1685.10 → 1692.10] Outlive my love for You
[1692.10 → 1696.64] Let's bow our heads.
[1698.58 → 1702.22] Father, what language can we borrow?
[1703.22 → 1706.02] What can we say in the presence of such love?
[1706.84 → 1708.72] We deserved Your place.
[1709.78 → 1711.88] We have sinned against You.
[1711.88 → 1718.88] We have allowed other things to take Your rightful place in our hearts and our lives.
[1718.88 → 1723.00] We fall at Your feet, saved by Your grace.
[1723.00 → 1727.26] How we long for more of Your presence in our lives.
[1727.26 → 1732.36] Take our cold heart and breathe new life into us.
[1732.36 → 1739.36] Make us new creations forever Yours.
[1739.36 → 1741.36] Captivate us with Your beauty.
[1741.36 → 1745.36] And may we never outlive our love for You.
[1745.36 → 1747.36] Amen.
[1747.36 → 1772.68] To God's love for you, be my Marian.
[1772.68 → 1786.38] Who stood before creation, eternity in your hand?
[1787.28 → 1796.04] You spoke the earth into motion, my soul now to stand.
[1796.04 → 1812.34] You stood before my failure, and carried the cross for my shame.
[1812.34 → 1822.18] My sin weighed upon your shoulders, my soul now to stand.
[1822.18 → 1828.18] So what can I say?
[1831.18 → 1835.18] What can I do?
[1835.18 → 1850.18] I offer this heart, O God, completely to you.
[1850.18 → 1864.18] I walk upon salvation, your spirit alive in me.
[1864.18 → 1874.18] My life to declare your promise, my soul now to stand.
[1874.18 → 1904.18] 
[1904.18 → 1906.18] What can I say?
[1906.18 → 1908.18] What can I say?
[1908.18 → 1913.18] And what can I do?
[1913.18 → 1914.18] What can I do?
[1914.18 → 1928.18] I offer this heart, O God, completely to you.
[1928.18 → 1945.18] I'll stand with arms high and heart of man and earth.
[1945.18 → 1951.18] In awe of the one who gave it all.
[1951.18 → 1954.18] I'll stand with arms high and heart of man and earth.
[1954.18 → 1961.18] I'll stand with arms high and heart of man and earth.
[1961.18 → 1967.18] I'll stand with arms high and earth.
[1967.18 → 1970.18] I'll stand with arms high and heart of man and earth.
[1970.18 → 1975.18] In awe of the one who gave it all.
[1976.18 → 1982.18] I'll stand with arms high and heart of man and earth.
[1982.18 → 1987.34] How I am is yours

[2196.16 → 2198.16] How I am yours
[2198.16 → 2200.16] How I am yours
[2200.16 → 2202.16] How I am yours
[2202.16 → 2213.70] Lives are broken all around us, a sparrow flower sees.
[2213.70 → 2226.90] The God needs hearts and arms to open in mercy for the least of these.
[2226.90 → 2247.14] Lord, may our hearts redeemed in mercy have mercy on the knees of these.
[2256.90 → 2263.90] Amen.
[2263.90 → 2275.90] What love is this?
[2275.90 → 2289.14] What love is this?
[2289.14 → 2296.14] That bears a cross.
[2296.14 → 2304.14] That says your will not might be done.
[2304.14 → 2311.14] Father, forgive me, they know not what they do.
[2311.14 → 2330.14] This is the love of Jesus, love from the heart of God.
[2330.14 → 2345.14] What grace is this?
[2345.14 → 2349.14] What grace is this?
[2349.14 → 2356.14] He's gone to all.
[2356.14 → 2363.14] It is our sins that we've done.
[2363.14 → 2371.14] It is for us that he suffers on the cross.
[2371.14 → 2378.14] This is the praise of Jesus,
[2378.14 → 2390.14] Praise from the heart of God.
[2390.14 → 2397.14] What wondrous love is this?
[2397.14 → 2417.14] Oh, my soul, that caused the Lord of bliss to bear the dreadful curse.
[2417.14 → 2424.14] What love is this?
[2424.14 → 2430.14] What grace divine?
[2430.14 → 2436.14] What grace divine?
[2436.14 → 2451.14] No greater gift will ever be.
[2451.14 → 2457.14] Our blessed Saviour, die that we might give.
[2457.14 → 2464.14] This gift so freely given.
[2464.14 → 2482.14] Love, love from the heart of God.
[2482.14 → 2492.14] The heart of God.
[2492.14 → 2503.14] The blood of God.
[2512.14 → 2533.14] The heart of God.
[2533.14 → 2543.14] We are going to spend the next while reading together and reflecting on the story of Good Friday and the death of Jesus on the cross.
[2543.14 → 2546.14] And we're going to do that from the Gospel of Mark.
[2546.14 → 2556.14] So I'm going to encourage you, if you have a Bible with you, to open it up or if you have a device with a Bible on it, to get that out, to turn that on and jump to Mark 15.
[2556.14 → 2563.14] We're going to start together in verse 16.
[2563.14 → 2564.14] And with you.
[2564.14 → 2567.14] Before we read, I'm going to pray.
[2567.14 → 2572.14] Would you join your heart with me in prayer together?
[2572.14 → 2591.14] Lord Jesus, as we come to you this evening, we know that you are the good shepherd and that the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
[2591.14 → 2603.14] And we know that your sheep hear your voice and know it and experience your love in it.
[2603.14 → 2608.14] And so now take this story and make it more than just a story.
[2608.14 → 2614.14] Make it the true story of the whole world in our hearts and minds right now.
[2614.14 → 2623.14] Open our spiritual imaginations that we might hear Jesus, that we might see you.
[2624.14 → 2630.14] And that we might be touched as we look upon you in the hour of your death.
[2632.14 → 2636.14] We pray this in your holy name.
[2636.14 → 2637.14] Amen.
[2637.14 → 2647.14] So this is the word of the Lord from Mark 15, beginning at verse 16.
[2647.14 → 2658.14] The soldiers led Jesus away into the palace, that is the praetorian, and called together the whole company of soldiers.
[2658.14 → 2667.14] They put a purple robe on him, then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on him, and they began to call out to him.
[2668.14 → 2670.14] Hail, King of the Jews.
[2670.14 → 2675.14] Again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spit on him.
[2675.14 → 2678.14] Falling on their knees, they paid homage to him.
[2678.14 → 2683.14] And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him.
[2683.14 → 2688.14] Then they led him out to crucify him.
[2689.14 → 2700.14] Now a certain man from Cyrene, Simon, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing by on his way in from the country, and they forced him to carry the cross.
[2700.14 → 2705.14] They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha, which means the place of the skull.
[2705.14 → 2709.14] They offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it.
[2709.14 → 2712.14] And they crucified him, dividing up his clothes.
[2712.14 → 2715.14] They cast lots to see what each would get.
[2715.14 → 2720.14] It was nine in the morning when they crucified him.
[2720.14 → 2723.14] The written notice of the charge against him read,
[2723.14 → 2726.14] The King of the Jews.
[2726.14 → 2733.14] They crucified two rebels with him, one on his right and one on his left.
[2733.14 → 2738.14] And those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying,
[2738.14 → 2745.14] So, you who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, come down from the cross and save yourself.
[2745.14 → 2751.14] In the same way, the chief priests and the teachers of the law mocked him among themselves.
[2751.14 → 2755.14] He saved others, but he can't save himself.
[2755.14 → 2761.14] Let this Messiah, this King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see him and believe.
[2761.14 → 2768.14] Those crucified with him also heaped insults on him.
[2768.14 → 2777.14] At noon, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon.
[2777.14 → 2781.14] And at three in the afternoon, Jesus cried out in a loud voice,
[2781.14 → 2785.14] Eloy, Eloy, lama Sabaean.
[2785.14 → 2791.14] Which means, my God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
[2791.14 → 2795.14] When some of those standing near heard this, they said,
[2795.14 → 2798.14] Listen, he's calling Elijah.
[2798.14 → 2804.14] Someone ran and filled a sponge with wine vinegar and put it on a staff and offered it to Jesus to drink.
[2804.14 → 2809.14] Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down.
[2809.14 → 2816.14] With a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last.
[2816.14 → 2825.14] And the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.
[2825.14 → 2830.14] And when the centurion who stood there in front of Jesus saw how he died, he said,
[2830.14 → 2835.14] Surely this man was the Son of God.
[2835.14 → 2850.14] This is the word of the Lord.
[2850.14 → 2855.14] Why did Jesus die?
[2855.14 → 2857.14] Why did Jesus have to die?
[2857.14 → 2861.14] That's the question of Good Friday.
[2861.14 → 2865.14] That's the question we're going to live in for a little while.
[2865.14 → 2871.14] Now Mark writes his gospel in no small part to help us answer that question.
[2871.14 → 2875.14] So we're going to look at the story, the part we read and a little bit preceding,
[2875.14 → 2879.14] to see if we can get there together.
[2879.14 → 2882.14] The story will tell us some things.
[2882.14 → 2887.14] Now if your Bibles are open, like I encourage you to do, look at chapter 14.
[2887.14 → 2890.14] Right? In chapter 14, Jesus is arrested.
[2890.14 → 2892.14] He has been betrayed by Judas Iscariot.
[2892.14 → 2898.14] He's been brought to the high priest and to the chief priests, to the elders and the teachers of the law, the Sanhedrin,
[2898.14 → 2903.14] which is the whole religion-political ruling class of Jerusalem.
[2903.14 → 2905.14] He has been brought before them.
[2905.14 → 2910.14] And in chapter 14, verse 55,
[2910.14 → 2919.14] the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death.
[2919.14 → 2922.14] But they did not find any.
[2922.14 → 2928.14] Many testified falsely against him, but their statements did not agree.
[2928.14 → 2937.14] They wanted to find a reason to put him to death, but they couldn't, at least not easily.
[2937.14 → 2938.14] Verse 57,
[2938.14 → 2943.14] Now some stood up and gave this false testimony against him.
[2943.14 → 2945.14] We heard him say,
[2945.14 → 2948.14] I will destroy this temple made with human hands,
[2948.14 → 2952.14] and in three days we'll build another not made with human hands.
[2952.14 → 2956.14] Yet even then their testimony did not agree.
[2956.14 → 2966.14] Now, if you are familiar with the story, this is a false testimony, but based on half-truths and really a manipulation of facts.
[2966.14 → 2967.14] Right?
[2967.14 → 2970.14] It's a creative recounting of history.
[2970.14 → 2977.14] Because, and the Gospel of John does record this event, this story of destroy this temple.
[2977.14 → 2978.14] Right?
[2978.14 → 2980.14] Jesus says, destroy this temple.
[2980.14 → 2982.14] And first, notice the agency there.
[2982.14 → 2983.14] Right?
[2983.14 → 2985.14] The false accusation that is made against him.
[2985.14 → 2988.14] Jesus is the one destroying this temple.
[2988.14 → 2995.14] And in Jesus' actual words, recorded in John, it's the leaders and the temple officials who are going to do the destroying.
[2995.14 → 3003.14] And then, in the Gospel according to John again, it's that Jesus says, destroy this temple and I will raise it in three days.
[3003.14 → 3012.14] John uses the word raise to directly connect Jesus to the temple and what will happen three days from now.
[3012.14 → 3018.14] But the people are stuck on a physical building in Mark's account.
[3018.14 → 3024.14] In three days, I will build another, is what they put on the lips of Jesus.
[3024.14 → 3029.14] But even that testimony doesn't agree.
[3029.14 → 3037.14] And so, in verse 60, the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus,
[3037.14 → 3041.14] Are you not going to answer?
[3041.14 → 3045.14] What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?
[3045.14 → 3050.14] But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer.
[3050.14 → 3057.14] They're looking for a reason to kill him, but Jesus stays silent.
[3057.14 → 3067.14] They're looking for a reason to kill him, but Jesus isn't giving them one, at least not yet, because he's also not giving them a reason.
[3067.14 → 3073.14] But finally, they asked the right question.
[3073.14 → 3082.14] Again, the high priest asked him, Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?
[3082.14 → 3091.14] Are you the Messiah, the Christ, the Anointed One, the Promised One of Isaiah 53, which we had read for us earlier in the service?
[3091.14 → 3094.14] Are you the chosen King who will come?
[3094.14 → 3097.14] And then that second part is important.
[3097.14 → 3100.14] Are you the Son of the Blessed One?
[3100.14 → 3106.14] Now, this is another way for the high priest to ask, Are you the Son of God?
[3106.14 → 3115.14] Now, you might know this, but Jews of the day, and even today, don't say the name of God.
[3115.14 → 3118.14] They don't even write out his covenant name.
[3118.14 → 3122.14] The idea here is to avoid all blasphemy, right?
[3122.14 → 3133.14] And blasphemy is a word for falsely attributing things to God that are not of God, or falsely calling something or someone God who is not God.
[3133.14 → 3145.14] And so, in a trial like this, which as we will see, is ultimately about blasphemy, it makes sense that the high priest accuser would also be certain to avoid misspeaking the name of God.
[3145.14 → 3146.14] Right?
[3146.14 → 3147.14] Right?
[3147.14 → 3150.14] So, he would use a phrase like Son of the Blessed One.
[3150.14 → 3157.14] But the question is, right, the question behind the question is, are you the Son of God?
[3157.14 → 3166.14] Now, by the time of Jesus, that phrase, Son of God, is a title that has become associated with messianic expectations.
[3166.14 → 3168.14] So, the hope of the Messiah.
[3168.14 → 3174.14] The Jewish people called the expected Messiah the Son of God.
[3174.14 → 3184.14] Now, not in a way that we do today as Christians, not in a way that we have come to mean that, not in the way that even Jesus himself will mean it.
[3184.14 → 3197.14] In fact, and this will matter later in the story, Jews would use the phrase Son of God like they would have a king being God's representative for the people.
[3197.14 → 3200.14] Right? The king is chosen by God.
[3200.14 → 3202.14] He is anointed by him.
[3202.14 → 3206.14] Remember, the word Messiah is Hebrew for anointed one.
[3206.14 → 3211.14] And so, they would use the title Son of God as an honorific.
[3211.14 → 3215.14] Right? As the king would be called the Son of God.
[3215.14 → 3221.14] The same is true in the Roman world that's happening, that this story takes place in.
[3221.14 → 3228.14] Every Roman coin throughout the empire and the time of Jesus is inscribed with the phrase,
[3228.14 → 3233.14] Tiberius Caesar, son of the divine Augustus.
[3233.14 → 3238.14] Right? Loyal Romans called Caesar, son of God.
[3238.14 → 3240.14] Now, remember that.
[3240.14 → 3242.14] Hold on to that idea.
[3242.14 → 3246.14] And this time, like we said, this time it's the right question.
[3246.14 → 3250.14] Jesus answers, breaking his silence.
[3250.14 → 3253.14] Jesus answers, verse 62, saying,
[3253.14 → 3256.14] I am.
[3256.14 → 3262.14] And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the mighty one and coming on the clouds,
[3262.14 → 3263.14] clouds of heaven.
[3263.14 → 3266.14] Right?
[3266.14 → 3270.14] Without asking it, but still asking it, the chief priest says,
[3270.14 → 3272.14] Are you the am?
[3272.14 → 3275.14] And Jesus says, I am.
[3275.14 → 3278.14] I am the Son of Man.
[3278.14 → 3284.14] Which is itself another messianic title from the prophets Ezekiel and from Daniel.
[3284.14 → 3288.14] In fact, we're going to look at Daniel 7 really quick.
[3288.14 → 3290.14] In Daniel 7, it reads,
[3290.14 → 3299.14] In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man coming with the clouds of heaven.
[3299.14 → 3304.14] And he approached the Ancient of days and was led into his presence.
[3304.14 → 3307.14] He was given authority, glory, and sovereign power.
[3307.14 → 3311.14] All nations and peoples of every language worshipped him.
[3311.14 → 3316.14] His dominion is everlasting dominion that will not pass away,
[3316.14 → 3320.14] and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.
[3320.14 → 3327.14] Daniel looks, and he sees a Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven.
[3327.14 → 3331.14] And this Son of Man is given authority and glory and sovereign power,
[3331.14 → 3335.14] and all nations, all people everywhere will worship him.
[3335.14 → 3337.14] His kingdom is forever.
[3337.14 → 3340.14] This is who Jesus is.
[3340.14 → 3345.14] This is who Jesus is saying he is at that moment by taking on that language.
[3345.14 → 3348.14] And don't miss this again.
[3348.14 → 3352.14] The high priest calls God the blessed one,
[3352.14 → 3356.14] and Jesus does the same thing calling God the mighty one.
[3356.14 → 3357.14] Right?
[3357.14 → 3360.14] He is careful not to blaspheme,
[3360.14 → 3363.14] and is still saying that he is God,
[3363.14 → 3367.14] the Son of God, and worthy to be worshipped.
[3367.14 → 3370.14] It's not blaspheming if it's true.
[3370.14 → 3373.14] And notice what else Jesus says, right?
[3373.14 → 3378.14] He says, you will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds from heaven.
[3378.14 → 3383.14] So this, if you're, again, if you're familiar with the Bible story,
[3383.14 → 3385.14] and the story of the Bible,
[3385.14 → 3389.14] this is a pretty common image for Jesus' eventual return.
[3389.14 → 3393.14] But I think most of us miss it.
[3393.14 → 3398.14] And we miss it because of days like today, actually.
[3398.14 → 3399.14] Right?
[3399.14 → 3403.14] Where you look out at the sky, and it's a beautiful blue sky,
[3403.14 → 3406.14] and there's these big white puffy clouds flowing through it.
[3406.14 → 3407.14] Right?
[3407.14 → 3410.14] When we picture Jesus coming from heaven in the clouds,
[3410.14 → 3411.14] that's what we picture.
[3411.14 → 3412.14] Right?
[3412.14 → 3414.14] We look up to the sky, and that's what we see.
[3414.14 → 3416.14] There's these soft white fluffy clouds,
[3416.14 → 3418.14] and then there's Jesus riding in on them,
[3418.14 → 3421.14] at least in my mind, kind of like a magic carpet.
[3421.14 → 3423.14] But that's not the image.
[3423.14 → 3426.14] That's not the point that's being made here.
[3426.14 → 3427.14] Right?
[3427.14 → 3430.14] Where else do clouds show up in the Bible?
[3430.14 → 3434.14] Now, if you have been worshipping with us here at Emmanuel for a little while,
[3434.14 → 3436.14] we've been in the book of Exodus.
[3436.14 → 3438.14] And where's the cloud there?
[3438.14 → 3441.14] The pillar of cloud.
[3441.14 → 3442.14] Right?
[3442.14 → 3445.14] God leads His people through the wilderness in a pillar of cloud,
[3445.14 → 3449.14] a column of cloud that catches fire in the evening,
[3449.14 → 3451.14] and then leads the people around.
[3451.14 → 3454.14] In the book of Exodus, when God comes down, right,
[3454.14 → 3456.14] when He descends to meet Moses on the mountain,
[3456.14 → 3458.14] what is it surrounded with?
[3458.14 → 3460.14] A cloud.
[3460.14 → 3461.14] Right?
[3461.14 → 3465.14] When the tabernacle is built, God descends, His glory comes down,
[3465.14 → 3470.14] we read, as a cloud that rests over the Ark of the Covenant.
[3470.14 → 3471.14] Right?
[3471.14 → 3474.14] The same happens when Solomon builds the temple eventually.
[3474.14 → 3475.14] Right?
[3475.14 → 3479.14] The glory of God descends in a cloud.
[3479.14 → 3485.14] Now, in Hebrew, what we're talking about here is called the Shekinah glory,
[3485.14 → 3490.14] the dwelling presence of God, the settling among God's people presence.
[3490.14 → 3493.14] Those are the clouds of heaven.
[3493.14 → 3494.14] And so, when Jesus says,
[3494.14 → 3497.14] you will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven,
[3497.14 → 3500.14] it's not a soft, white, fluffy cloud.
[3500.14 → 3508.14] It is a booming, powerful, radiating presence and power of God kind of cloud.
[3508.14 → 3511.14] In Matthew 24, Jesus says,
[3511.14 → 3518.14] they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
[3518.14 → 3520.14] What glory?
[3520.14 → 3522.14] The Shekinah glory.
[3522.14 → 3523.14] Right?
[3523.14 → 3527.14] The pillar of cloud glory, the presence of God glory.
[3527.14 → 3529.14] In fact, we'll tie this even further.
[3529.14 → 3535.14] I think that this is the same picture that we get in 1 Thessalonians 4.
[3535.14 → 3539.14] 1 Thessalonians 4, Paul is writing to the church in Thessalonica
[3539.14 → 3543.14] to encourage believers who are facing death.
[3543.14 → 3545.14] And he writes,
[3545.14 → 3551.14] For the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a loud command and the voice of the archangel
[3551.14 → 3554.14] and with the trumpet-call of God and the dead in Christ will rise first.
[3554.14 → 3557.14] And after that, we who are still alive are left,
[3557.14 → 3562.14] will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.
[3562.14 → 3565.14] And so, we will be with the Lord forever.
[3565.14 → 3566.14] Right?
[3566.14 → 3569.14] To be with Jesus in the clouds.
[3569.14 → 3570.14] Right?
[3570.14 → 3572.14] And notice, Jesus is coming down from heaven.
[3572.14 → 3574.14] So, these are the clouds of heaven.
[3574.14 → 3575.14] Right?
[3575.14 → 3578.14] This isn't about escaping the world to the clouds.
[3578.14 → 3584.14] This isn't, this is rather about the glory of God, the clouds of heaven coming down to this world
[3584.14 → 3588.14] in its fullest revelation of God's own glory.
[3588.14 → 3589.14] Right?
[3589.14 → 3596.14] The Bible doesn't actually talk about a secret rapture or a rapture of an escape really of any kind.
[3596.14 → 3597.14] Right?
[3597.14 → 3603.14] The end of the story is about being raised up and being enraptured by the glory of God.
[3603.14 → 3608.14] The glory of God comes down like a cloud.
[3608.14 → 3613.14] But there's only one way to get there.
[3613.14 → 3620.14] There's only one way that the glory of God breaks free into the whole world.
[3620.14 → 3625.14] And that way needs a cross.
[3625.14 → 3628.14] Look at the people in the story.
[3628.14 → 3629.14] Right?
[3629.14 → 3634.14] Look at what they do.
[3634.14 → 3637.14] Hail, King of the Jews.
[3637.14 → 3640.14] They mock him.
[3640.14 → 3649.14] So, you who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, come down from the cross and save yourself.
[3649.14 → 3651.14] They ridicule him.
[3651.14 → 3655.14] He saved others, but he can't save himself.
[3655.14 → 3657.14] They belittle him.
[3657.14 → 3662.14] Come down from the cross that we may see and believe.
[3662.14 → 3666.14] They despised him.
[3666.14 → 3673.14] Even those being crucified alongside of him heaped insults on him.
[3673.14 → 3679.14] These are the very people who have seen Jesus for at least three years do miracles and teach with authority.
[3679.14 → 3685.14] Some of these same people no doubt herald him as king just a few days before this on Palm Sunday.
[3685.14 → 3691.14] These are the same people who have heard the stories and have seen the effects of his ministry in the world.
[3691.14 → 3695.14] Point is, these people should have known better.
[3695.14 → 3697.14] They should have done better.
[3697.14 → 3700.14] They should have at least had an idea of what was going on.
[3700.14 → 3704.14] But they didn't.
[3704.14 → 3710.14] A few years ago, I read a book series by Ted Decker.
[3710.14 → 3711.14] Maybe you're familiar with it.
[3711.14 → 3713.14] It's the Circle series.
[3713.14 → 3721.14] If you haven't read this series of books, they're about a man who falls asleep in the world, and he wakes up in an alternate universe.
[3721.14 → 3724.14] Now, this kind of fantasy and magic is right up my alley.
[3724.14 → 3727.14] If it's not up yours, the next 30 seconds are going to bother you.
[3727.14 → 3732.14] But so Thomas Hunter wakes up in another universe.
[3732.14 → 3743.14] This other universe that he wakes up in is about to be overcome by a leprosy like plague and a spreading darkness that will forever alter the people who live there.
[3743.14 → 3747.14] And so by the end of the first book, spoiler alert, it's kind of depressing.
[3747.14 → 3748.14] Right.
[3748.14 → 3754.14] And so, after the first book, deathliness, this darkness, wins, and it spreads throughout the whole world.
[3754.14 → 3767.14] Except for Hunter and a band of loyal followers who gather together, and they have found one small corner of the world that the darkness has been held at bay from.
[3767.14 → 3783.14] And these people have to do a bunch of rituals and practices in order to keep the deathliness at bay and in order to keep the darkness out from their community built in this beautiful forest, a forest that is surrounded by dark desert.
[3783.14 → 3789.14] Now, in the next book in the series, a new character is introduced.
[3789.14 → 3794.14] Now, if you've read anything by Ted Decker, you know it's a thinly veiled allegory for the gospel.
[3794.14 → 3797.14] This character is named Justin.
[3797.14 → 3802.14] And this Justin comes into direct conflict with Hunter.
[3802.14 → 3803.14] Right.
[3803.14 → 3810.14] Justin has gathered himself a band of misfits and scabs, they're called, people who have this leprosy like disease.
[3810.14 → 3811.14] Right.
[3811.14 → 3814.14] The people who have been overcome by the deathliness.
[3814.14 → 3816.14] And he fights Hunter.
[3816.14 → 3819.14] He is a thorn in his side for the entire story.
[3819.14 → 3824.14] And as I read this book, I got more and more frustrated with Justin.
[3824.14 → 3832.14] And I'm not proud to admit, but I confess to you that at some point in the story, I hated him for what he was doing.
[3832.14 → 3835.14] For how he was treating Hunter, who was the hero.
[3835.14 → 3844.14] And his band of people are just trying to survive and eke out a good existence in a world of death and darkness.
[3844.14 → 3850.14] I would get, like, palpably angry as I read this story.
[3850.14 → 3854.14] Now, as I tell the story here, two things.
[3854.14 → 3856.14] You've probably already figured it out.
[3856.14 → 3858.14] But I'm not the smartest guy in the world.
[3858.14 → 3860.14] At least, I'm not the smartest guy you know.
[3860.14 → 3862.14] And for your sake, I hope that that's true.
[3862.14 → 3864.14] But I have a degree in history.
[3864.14 → 3865.14] And I studied philosophy.
[3865.14 → 3867.14] I have a master's degree in divinity.
[3867.14 → 3872.14] So you think, I would have been able to figure out where this is going.
[3872.14 → 3882.14] But as I read that story, it became abundantly clear in an instant that Justin is Jesus.
[3882.14 → 3886.14] And I hated him.
[3886.14 → 3893.14] The saviour figure in the story, I despised.
[3893.14 → 3897.14] The point is, I should have known better.
[3897.14 → 3901.14] But I didn't.
[3901.14 → 3908.14] And I remember that every time I read Mark 15.
[3908.14 → 3914.14] If you were the kind of person who reads yourself into stories, if you were the kind of person who wonders,
[3914.14 → 3916.14] who would you be in this story?
[3916.14 → 3920.14] The truth is, you are the one who mocks.
[3920.14 → 3922.14] I am the one who ridicules.
[3922.14 → 3924.14] We would despise.
[3924.14 → 3929.14] And that's why I had the other pastoral staff read those lines.
[3929.14 → 3931.14] Because that is us.
[3931.14 → 3934.14] That is our voice in this story.
[3934.14 → 3938.14] If we believe Isaiah 53 to be true, and I do.
[3938.14 → 3940.14] I trust that you do.
[3940.14 → 3941.14] We should have seen it.
[3941.14 → 3942.14] Right?
[3942.14 → 3943.14] We should have known better.
[3943.14 → 3944.14] Right?
[3944.14 → 3945.14] Isaiah 53 says,
[3945.14 → 3947.14] There were many who were appalled at him.
[3947.14 → 3949.14] He was despised and rejected by humanity.
[3949.14 → 3952.14] He was despised, and we held him in low esteem.
[3952.14 → 3956.14] He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth.
[3956.14 → 3958.14] Sounds familiar, right?
[3958.14 → 3974.14] And if that part of Isaiah 53 is true, and we see here in Mark 14 and 15 that it is, I want to suggest that so too are the other parts of Isaiah 53.
[3974.14 → 3975.14] Right?
[3975.14 → 3980.14] The parts that say, surely he took our pain.
[3980.14 → 3983.14] He bore our suffering.
[3983.14 → 3984.14] Right?
[3984.14 → 3986.14] Jesus is perfect.
[3986.14 → 3987.14] He is the Son of God.
[3987.14 → 3989.14] He didn't deserve to die.
[3989.14 → 3992.14] If, as Paul writes in Romans, the wages of sin is death.
[3992.14 → 3995.14] One who is without sin doesn't deserve death.
[3995.14 → 3996.14] But Jesus died.
[3996.14 → 3999.14] He died because I deserve death.
[3999.14 → 4001.14] He died because of my sin.
[4001.14 → 4003.14] He died for our sin.
[4003.14 → 4004.14] He died for your sin.
[4004.14 → 4007.14] It is your sin that held him there.
[4007.14 → 4012.14] He was punished by God and stricken by him and afflicted.
[4012.14 → 4017.14] He was pierced for our transgressions, crushed for our iniquities.
[4017.14 → 4020.14] The punishment that brought us peace was upon him.
[4020.14 → 4024.14] By his wounds we are healed.
[4024.14 → 4025.14] Healed.
[4025.14 → 4033.14] And yet, yet it was the Lord's will to crush him and to cause him to suffer.
[4033.14 → 4037.14] The Lord makes his life an offering for sin.
[4037.14 → 4042.14] Jesus dies on the cross on that day as an offering for sin.
[4042.14 → 4047.14] Not for his, but for ours.
[4047.14 → 4051.14] Not for his, but for mine.
[4051.14 → 4057.14] The wages of sin is death and Jesus paid that death.
[4057.14 → 4062.14] But it's also so much more than just death as horrific as that is.
[4062.14 → 4063.14] Right?
[4063.14 → 4068.14] The Lord's cross, Jesus cries out, Eloy, Eloy, Lima Sebastien, which means, my God, my God,
[4068.14 → 4070.14] why have you forsaken me?
[4070.14 → 4073.14] And this is another quote from Psalm 22.
[4073.14 → 4075.14] And there the psalmist continues.
[4075.14 → 4078.14] And again, hear these words over top of the story of Jesus.
[4078.14 → 4079.14] Right?
[4079.14 → 4081.14] Scorned by everyone, the psalmist writes.
[4081.14 → 4083.14] Despised by the people.
[4083.14 → 4084.14] All who see me mock me.
[4084.14 → 4087.14] They hurl insults, shaking their heads.
[4087.14 → 4088.14] He trusts the Lord, they say.
[4088.14 → 4090.14] Let the Lord rescue him.
[4090.14 → 4094.14] Let him deliver him since he delights in him.
[4094.14 → 4097.14] It's the same thing that the people in Mark say.
[4097.14 → 4101.14] My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
[4101.14 → 4115.14] Jesus on that cross at that moment is experiencing the punishment for sin.
[4115.14 → 4117.14] The consequence for sin.
[4117.14 → 4120.14] The wages of sin.
[4120.14 → 4121.14] And he feels it.
[4121.14 → 4123.14] He bears it.
[4123.14 → 4126.14] The love that Jesus has known from the Father.
[4126.14 → 4136.14] The love of the Father and the Holy Spirit that he has intimately experienced throughout all eternity prior to this moment is removed from him.
[4136.14 → 4137.14] Right?
[4137.14 → 4138.14] He loses the Father.
[4138.14 → 4139.14] He loses the Father.
[4139.14 → 4145.14] He's forsaken by the Father because we lost the Father first.
[4145.14 → 4151.14] He loses the Father so that you and I can be found by him.
[4151.14 → 4155.14] My God, my God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
[4155.14 → 4158.14] Isn't a rhetorical question for Jesus on the cross.
[4158.14 → 4166.14] And the answer to that question is for you.
[4166.14 → 4168.14] For me.
[4168.14 → 4169.14] Right?
[4169.14 → 4170.14] Right?
[4170.14 → 4174.14] The judgment that should have fallen on me is on him instead.
[4174.14 → 4179.14] He died the death that we should have died so that we can be saved from judgment.
[4179.14 → 4189.14] Even as I call out among the scoffers, he prays, Father, forgive him.
[4189.14 → 4202.14] And with a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last.
[4202.14 → 4204.14] And it worked.
[4204.14 → 4205.14] Right?
[4205.14 → 4210.14] His death accomplished exactly what God said it would in Isaiah 53.
[4210.14 → 4217.14] His death accomplished exactly what Jesus promised it would and precisely what he said it would accomplish.
[4217.14 → 4221.14] And it came about in exactly the way that he said was necessary.
[4221.14 → 4229.14] Three times in the Gospel of Mark, Jesus tells his disciples and followers directly what would happen.
[4229.14 → 4231.14] And that this was necessary.
[4231.14 → 4236.14] And still they don't understand, and they are too afraid to ask.
[4236.14 → 4238.14] But Jesus' death worked.
[4238.14 → 4240.14] It changes something.
[4240.14 → 4244.14] And here's how we know that it changed something.
[4244.14 → 4246.14] Something drastic.
[4246.14 → 4249.14] Look, with a loud cry, he breathed his last.
[4249.14 → 4257.14] And the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.
[4257.14 → 4261.14] The temple curtain is torn in two from top to bottom.
[4261.14 → 4262.14] And let me be really clear with you.
[4262.14 → 4263.14] Right?
[4263.14 → 4267.14] This curtain isn't like your shower curtain that falls down every morning at home.
[4267.14 → 4268.14] Right?
[4268.14 → 4269.14] This isn't a thin veil.
[4269.14 → 4272.14] This is a heavy, thick, dense fabric.
[4272.14 → 4275.14] It's more like a wall than it is a sheet.
[4275.14 → 4276.14] Right?
[4276.14 → 4281.14] The curtain in the temple separates the Holy of Holies from the rest of the temple.
[4281.14 → 4285.14] And the Holy of Holies is that Shekinah glory dwelling place of God.
[4285.14 → 4288.14] It is the place where he resides.
[4288.14 → 4297.14] And only one day a year on Yom Kippur, on the Day of Atonement, can the High Priest enter there and make atonement for the sins of the people.
[4297.14 → 4307.14] And only after the High Priest has made all sorts of sacrifices for himself and has only gone through all of these rituals of preparation is he able to enter into that place.
[4307.14 → 4313.14] The point is, no sin can enter there.
[4313.14 → 4321.14] And the curtain being torn in two says that this sacrifice of Jesus has done what all others have pointed to.
[4321.14 → 4327.14] And it's torn in two from top to bottom just to make it perfectly clear who is doing the tearing.
[4327.14 → 4328.14] Right?
[4328.14 → 4334.14] At the moment of Jesus' death, God is saying, this is the sacrifice to end all sacrifices.
[4334.14 → 4340.14] The way to approach me is open, and my glory is pouring out to you.
[4340.14 → 4346.14] Jesus paid the price for my sin.
[4346.14 → 4353.14] And anyone who believes can come into God's presence.
[4353.14 → 4360.14] And to make sure we get that detail, to make sure we get that point, Mark tells us one more thing and we'll end here.
[4360.14 → 4365.14] The curtain of the temple is torn in two from top to bottom.
[4365.14 → 4378.14] And when the centurion who stood there in front of Jesus saw how he died, he said, surely this man was the son of God.
[4378.14 → 4380.14] Remember what we said at the beginning?
[4380.14 → 4388.14] Right? A loyal Roman would call Caesar God, but no other person, no other man.
[4388.14 → 4389.14] And let me be really clear.
[4389.14 → 4390.14] This is a centurion, right?
[4390.14 → 4393.14] This isn't just some ordinary Roman.
[4393.14 → 4401.14] This is a battle-hardened warrior who has seen death, who has likely caused a fair bit of death.
[4401.14 → 4406.14] And this Roman soldier sees what all the other people could not.
[4406.14 → 4411.14] And he says, surely this is the son of God.
[4411.14 → 4417.14] The way of God and the way to God is open to anyone who believes.
[4417.14 → 4425.14] If you have your Bible open, turn to the very first words of Mark.
[4425.14 → 4428.14] Mark chapter 1, verse 1.
[4428.14 → 4430.14] Mark says,
[4430.14 → 4439.14] The beginning of the good news about Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God.
[4439.14 → 4441.14] The Son of God.
[4441.14 → 4449.14] Right from the opening words of Mark's Gospel, does he tell you, this is what you're going to see.
[4449.14 → 4460.14] Right from the opening line, the very first words, he says, I am telling you this story, I am writing this so that you might see that Jesus is the Messiah and the Son of God.
[4460.14 → 4464.14] But I challenge you, and I challenge you to fact-check me on this, this week.
[4464.14 → 4465.14] Right?
[4465.14 → 4475.14] How many times in this story, in the Gospel of Mark, do the people around Jesus see it?
[4475.14 → 4476.14] Once.
[4476.14 → 4477.14] Once.
[4477.14 → 4478.14] Once.
[4478.14 → 4479.14] Once.
[4479.14 → 4480.14] Right here.
[4480.14 → 4485.14] At the very end of the story, and it's a Roman.
[4485.14 → 4492.14] This is the only person in the entire story to profess Jesus is the Son of God.
[4492.14 → 4497.14] Now, twice in this story, demons recognize him for who he is.
[4497.14 → 4506.14] But the only person to realize it, to put it all together, to see it and have his heart's affections reordered is a Roman centurion.
[4506.14 → 4512.14] Not Peter, not any of the disciples, not his mother or any of the other women who ministered with him.
[4512.14 → 4521.14] This first confession of the divine son ship of Jesus belongs to a centurion.
[4521.14 → 4530.14] A Roman soldier who sees Jesus' death for what it is, the death of God.
[4530.14 → 4533.14] As you go from here today, see Jesus.
[4533.14 → 4535.14] See the Messiah.
[4535.14 → 4539.14] See the Son of God on the cross for you.
[4539.14 → 4547.14] As you go into Holy Saturday, and as we anticipate Easter Sunday when we come back here for our service in the morning,
[4547.14 → 4552.14] go, but don't miss what so many have missed.
[4552.14 → 4560.14] Go in the glory of God because of the cross of Jesus.
[4560.14 → 4569.14] Go and profess, surely this man, this Jesus, is the Son of God.
[4569.14 → 4570.14] Amen.
[4570.14 → 4571.14] Let me pray with you.
[4571.14 → 4581.14] Jesus, you are the Son of God.
[4581.14 → 4584.14] Jesus, you are Holy Messiah.
[4584.14 → 4590.14] Jesus, you are Saviour sent to save the world.
[4590.14 → 4595.14] And not only the world and others, but to save me.
[4595.14 → 4599.14] To save all who believe.
[4599.14 → 4604.14] And so, Lord Jesus, stir our belief tonight.
[4604.14 → 4615.14] Stir our hearts to see you and our loves to embrace you as we see ourselves being embraced by you.
[4615.14 → 4623.14] Open our eyes to the truth of the cross and the truth of who you are.
[4623.14 → 4628.14] May we know your glory today.
[4628.14 → 4630.14] In Jesus Christ we pray.
[4630.14 → 4631.14] Amen.
[4631.14 → 4648.14] Let's stand together.
[4648.14 → 4649.14] Amen.
[4649.14 → 4652.14] Come live together.
[4652.14 → 4657.14] How may we begin CYK her smooth?
[4658.14 → 4660.14] May we!
[4660.14 → 4661.14] 木
[4678.14 → 4696.28] When I survey the wondrous cross,
[4696.28 → 4709.72] On which the Prince of Glory died,
[4709.72 → 4723.24] My richest gain I count but loss,
[4723.24 → 4737.24] And for contempt of all my pride.
[4737.24 → 4752.24] Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
[4752.24 → 4766.24] Saved in the death of Christ my God,
[4766.24 → 4780.24] All the vain things that shall be born,
[4780.24 → 4794.24] I sacrifice them through His blood.
[4794.24 → 4808.24] Sleep from His head, His hands, His feet,
[4808.24 → 4821.24] Sorrow and love flow mingled down,
[4821.24 → 4835.24] Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
[4835.24 → 4849.24] For thorns compose so rich a crown.
[4849.24 → 4865.24] Were the whole realm of nature bound,
[4865.24 → 4872.24] Thou's world yet said,
[4872.24 → 4879.24] Far too strong,
[4879.24 → 4885.24] Love so amazing,
[4885.24 → 4893.24] The Lord is so divine,
[4893.24 → 4898.24] Cements my soul,
[4898.24 → 4901.24] My life,
[4901.24 → 4907.24] My all.
[4907.24 → 4913.24] Mark 15 says,
[4913.24 → 4917.24] It was Preparation Day,
[4917.24 → 4921.24] That is, the day before the Sabbath.
[4921.24 → 4923.24] So as evening approached,
[4923.24 → 4925.24] Joseph of Arimathea,
[4925.24 → 4928.24] A prominent member of the council,
[4928.24 → 4931.24] Who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God,
[4931.24 → 4933.24] Went boldly to Pilate,
[4933.24 → 4934.24] Went boldly to Pilate,
[4934.24 → 4937.24] And asked for Jesus' body.
[4937.24 → 4940.24] Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead.
[4940.24 → 4943.24] Summoning the centurion,
[4943.24 → 4946.24] He asked him if Jesus had already died.
[4946.24 → 4950.24] When he learned from the centurion that it was so,
[4950.24 → 4953.24] He gave the body to Joseph.
[4953.24 → 4957.24] So Joseph bought some linen cloth,
[4957.24 → 4959.24] Took down the body,
[4959.24 → 4962.24] Wrapped it in the linen,
[4962.24 → 4965.24] And placed it in a tomb cut out of rock.
[4965.24 → 4970.24] Then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.
[4974.24 → 4978.24] As we sing these last three verses,
[4978.24 → 4980.24] We asked at the end of the third verse,
[4980.24 → 4984.24] If we just walk out quietly.
[4984.24 → 5001.24] Were you there when they crucified my Lord?
[5001.24 → 5013.24] Were you there when they crucified my Lord?
[5013.24 → 5023.24] Were you there when they crucified my Lord?
[5023.24 → 5028.24] No.
[5028.24 → 5034.24] No.
[5034.24 → 5037.24] Sometimes it causes me to tremble,
[5037.24 → 5042.24] Sometimes it causes me to tremble,
[5042.24 → 5055.24] Tremble, tremble, tremble.
[5055.24 → 5061.24] Were you there when they crucified my Lord?
[5061.24 → 5068.24] Were you there when they nailed him to the tree?
[5068.24 → 5082.24] Were you there when they nailed him to the tree?
[5082.24 → 5095.24] Were you there when they nailed him to the tree?
[5095.24 → 5103.24] Oh, oh, oh.
[5103.24 → 5118.92] Sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble.
[5120.92 → 5131.36] Were you there when they nailed him to the tree?
[5133.24 → 5142.40] At three in the afternoon, Jesus cried out in a loud voice,
[5143.94 → 5146.90] Eloy, Eloy, lama sabachthani?
[5148.28 → 5154.74] Which means, my God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
[5163.24 → 5171.40] Were you there when they laid him in the tomb?
[5175.24 → 5184.24] Were you there when they laid him in the tomb?
[5184.24 → 5212.24] Oh, sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble.
[5212.24 → 5225.24] Were you there when they laid him in the tomb?
[5225.24 → 5226.24] No.
[5226.24 → 5227.24] No.
[5227.24 → 5228.24] No.
[5228.24 → 5229.24] No.
[5229.24 → 5230.24] No.
[5230.24 → 5231.24] No.
[5231.24 → 5261.22] Thank you.
