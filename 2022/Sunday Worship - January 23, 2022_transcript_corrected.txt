[567.00 → 568.00] I'll say good morning in a minute.
[568.00 → 588.00] I just found out that it is not ten yet.
[588.00 → 591.00] Yeah, Pastor Chris will say good morning.
[591.00 → 603.00] I kind of dropped the ball on that one.
[603.00 → 604.00] Good morning.
[604.00 → 606.00] Good morning.
[606.00 → 607.00] Welcome to church.
[607.00 → 611.00] I am so excited that we can be here together.
[611.00 → 613.00] We can be worshipping our God together.
[613.00 → 621.00] Whether you are present with us in person or if you are participating online, welcome to our worship this weekend.
[621.00 → 622.00] My name is Chris.
[622.00 → 623.00] I am one of the pastors here.
[623.00 → 630.00] It is my privilege to lead you along with these others in our worship together this morning.
[630.00 → 632.00] Just one announcement before we begin.
[632.00 → 634.00] That is for the youth.
[634.00 → 636.00] There is HCBC tonight.
[636.00 → 639.00] Please make arrangements to be here for that.
[639.00 → 644.00] If you have any questions about what that looks like, you can grab Pastor Kevin after the service.
[644.00 → 647.00] He will address those with you.
[647.00 → 650.00] We are going to worship our God together this morning.
[650.00 → 653.00] So I am going to invite you as you are able and where you are to stand.
[653.00 → 658.00] Or if you are at home, you can stand or just open your hands and take a posture of receipt.
[658.00 → 664.00] That we might be welcomed into God's presence with his greeting together.
[664.00 → 673.00] Open your hearts and your minds to hear from God in worship as he meets us in this place today.
[673.00 → 686.00] Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son and our Saviour through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[686.00 → 688.00] Amen.
[688.00 → 689.00] Let's worship God.
[689.00 → 695.00] Psalm 108 says,
[695.00 → 697.00] My heart, O God, is steadfast.
[697.00 → 700.00] I will sing and make music with all my soul.
[700.00 → 702.00] Awake, harp and lyre.
[702.00 → 704.00] I will awaken the dawn.
[704.00 → 707.00] I will praise you, Lord, among the nations.
[707.00 → 710.00] I will sing of you among the peoples.
[710.00 → 712.00] For great is your love.
[712.00 → 715.00] Higher than the heavens, your faithfulness reaches to the skies.
[715.00 → 719.00] Be exalted, O God, above the heavens.
[719.00 → 722.00] Let your glory be over all the earth.
[722.00 → 737.00] We stand and lift our hands.
[737.00 → 743.00] For the joy of the Lord is our strength.
[743.00 → 748.00] We bow down and worship him now.
[748.00 → 752.00] How great, how awesome is he.
[752.00 → 758.00] Together we sing.
[758.00 → 763.00] Everyone sing.
[763.00 → 769.00] Holy is the Lord God Almighty.
[769.00 → 773.00] The earth is filled with his glory.
[773.00 → 778.00] Holy is the Lord God Almighty.
[778.00 → 784.00] The earth is filled with his glory.
[784.00 → 790.00] The earth is filled with his glory.
[790.00 → 795.00] We stand and lift our hands.
[795.00 → 800.00] For the joy of the Lord is our strength.
[800.00 → 805.00] We bow down and worship him now.
[805.00 → 809.00] How great, how awesome is he.
[809.00 → 822.00] The earth is filled with his glory.
[822.16 → 829.12] is
[839.28 → 846.08] filled with his glory
[852.00 → 856.00] It's rising up all around
[856.00 → 861.00] It's the anthem of the Lord's ring now
[861.00 → 866.00] It's rising up all around
[866.00 → 873.00] It's the anthem of the Lord's ring now
[873.00 → 883.00] Together we sing, everyone sing
[883.00 → 889.00] Holy is the Lord God Almighty
[889.00 → 894.00] The earth is filled with His glory
[894.00 → 899.00] Holy is the Lord God Almighty
[899.00 → 904.00] The earth is filled with His glory
[904.00 → 909.00] The earth is filled with His glory
[909.00 → 914.00] The earth is filled with His glory
[929.00 → 944.00] Who breaks the power of sin and darkness
[944.00 → 949.00] Whose love is mighty and so much stronger
[949.00 → 951.00] The King of glory
[951.00 → 954.00] The King above all kings
[954.00 → 962.00] Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder
[962.00 → 967.00] And leaves us breathless in awe and wonder
[967.00 → 969.00] The King of glory
[969.00 → 974.00] The King above all kings
[974.00 → 979.00] This is amazing grace
[979.00 → 983.00] This is unfailing love
[983.00 → 988.00] That You would take my place
[988.00 → 993.00] That You would bear my cross
[993.00 → 997.00] You laid down Your life
[997.00 → 1003.00] That I would be set free
[1003.00 → 1007.00] Oh, Jesus I sing for
[1007.00 → 1010.00] All that You've done for me
[1010.00 → 1023.00] Who brings our chaos back into order
[1023.00 → 1028.00] Who makes the orphan a son and daughter
[1028.00 → 1032.00] The King of glory, the King of glory
[1032.00 → 1034.00] Who rose the nations
[1034.00 → 1036.00] With truth and justice
[1036.00 → 1041.00] Shines like the sun in all of its brilliance
[1041.00 → 1047.00] The King of glory, the King above all kings
[1047.00 → 1051.00] This is amazing grace
[1051.00 → 1056.00] This is unfailing love
[1056.00 → 1061.00] That You would take my place
[1061.00 → 1066.00] That You would bear my cross
[1066.00 → 1070.00] You laid down Your life
[1070.00 → 1076.00] That I would be set free
[1076.00 → 1079.00] Oh, Jesus I sing for
[1079.00 → 1083.00] All that You've done for me
[1083.00 → 1090.00] Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
[1090.00 → 1095.00] Worthy is the King who conquered the grave
[1095.00 → 1099.00] Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
[1099.00 → 1104.00] Worthy is the King who conquered the grave
[1104.00 → 1108.00] Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
[1108.00 → 1111.00] Worthy is the King who conquered the grave
[1111.00 → 1116.00] Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
[1116.00 → 1119.00] Worthy, worthy, worthy
[1119.00 → 1124.00] Oh, this is amazing grace
[1124.00 → 1128.00] This is unfailing love
[1128.00 → 1132.00] That You would take my place
[1132.00 → 1137.00] That You would bear my cross
[1137.00 → 1141.00] You would lay down Your life
[1141.00 → 1147.00] That I would be set free
[1147.00 → 1150.00] Oh, Jesus I sing for
[1150.00 → 1153.00] All that You've done for me
[1153.00 → 1164.00] You may be seated
[1164.00 → 1166.00] You may be seated
[1171.00 → 1174.00] Matthew 11, 28 and 29
[1174.00 → 1178.00] It says, come to me all you who are weary and burdened
[1178.00 → 1180.00] And I will give you rest
[1180.00 → 1181.00] Take my yoke upon you
[1181.00 → 1183.00] And lean or learn from me
[1183.00 → 1185.00] For I am gentle and humble in heart
[1185.00 → 1188.00] And you will find rest for your souls
[1188.00 → 1191.00] I was reflecting on that
[1191.00 → 1193.00] And I was thinking
[1193.00 → 1195.00] After 50 or 60 years of walking with Jesus
[1195.00 → 1199.00] It should be easy for me to come to Him and find rest
[1199.00 → 1206.00] But the old me still wants my vision of my life
[1206.00 → 1209.00] The old me still wants what I want
[1209.00 → 1211.00] For me, I guess it really comes down to trust
[1211.00 → 1215.00] Do I trust Jesus and His love for me?
[1215.00 → 1216.00] And His love for me?
[1216.00 → 1218.00] Even
[1218.00 → 1220.00] Or do I, sorry
[1220.00 → 1223.00] Do I trust Jesus and His love for me enough
[1223.00 → 1225.00] To give Him my life?
[1225.00 → 1228.00] To rest my future in His hands?
[1228.00 → 1231.00] I know the right answer
[1231.00 → 1232.00] But
[1232.00 → 1239.00] When the right answer isn't the honest answer
[1239.00 → 1241.00] Then I
[1241.00 → 1244.00] The part I don't like is
[1244.00 → 1246.00] The trill in my voice
[1246.00 → 1249.00] I reread these verses
[1249.00 → 1253.00] And I let the love I hear in these words
[1253.00 → 1254.00] Wash over me
[1254.00 → 1259.00] And I'm encouraged to rest my life in His hands
[1259.00 → 1261.00] Let's rise and sing
[1261.00 → 1262.00] Lord I need you
[1262.00 → 1287.00] Lord I come
[1287.00 → 1290.00] I confess
[1290.00 → 1291.00] I confess
[1291.00 → 1293.00] Bowing here
[1293.00 → 1297.00] I find my rest
[1297.00 → 1299.00] Without you
[1299.00 → 1303.00] I fall apart
[1303.00 → 1306.00] You're the one
[1306.00 → 1311.00] That guides my heart
[1311.00 → 1316.00] Lord I need you
[1316.00 → 1321.00] Oh I need you
[1321.00 → 1323.00] Every hour
[1323.00 → 1326.00] I need you
[1326.00 → 1329.00] I want defence
[1329.00 → 1331.00] My righteousness
[1331.00 → 1333.00] Oh God how I need you
[1333.00 → 1338.00] Oh God how I need you
[1338.00 → 1344.00] Where sin runs deep
[1344.00 → 1348.00] Your grace is Lord
[1348.00 → 1350.00] Where grace is found
[1350.00 → 1354.00] Is where you are
[1354.00 → 1356.00] Where you are
[1356.00 → 1358.00] Lord I am free
[1358.00 → 1359.00] Where you are
[1359.00 → 1360.00] Lord I am free
[1360.00 → 1367.00] Holiness is Christ in me
[1367.00 → 1368.00] Where you are
[1368.00 → 1369.00] Lord I am free
[1369.00 → 1371.00] Where you are
[1371.00 → 1372.00] Where you are
[1372.00 → 1373.00] Lord I am free
[1373.00 → 1381.00] Holiness is Christ to me
[1381.00 → 1390.00] Lord, I need you, oh, I need you
[1390.00 → 1396.00] Every hour I need you
[1396.00 → 1403.00] My one defence, my righteousness
[1403.00 → 1409.00] Oh God, how I need you
[1409.00 → 1415.00] Teach my song to rise to you
[1415.00 → 1420.00] When temptation comes my way
[1420.00 → 1426.00] When I cannot stand, I'll fall on you
[1426.00 → 1431.00] Jesus, you're my hope and stay
[1431.00 → 1437.00] When I cannot stand, I'll fall on you
[1437.00 → 1445.00] Jesus, you're my hope and stay
[1445.00 → 1452.00] Lord, I need you, oh, I need you
[1452.00 → 1458.00] Every hour I need you
[1458.00 → 1464.00] My one defence, my righteousness
[1464.00 → 1470.00] Oh God, how I need you
[1470.00 → 1491.00] My one defence, my righteousness
[1491.00 → 1497.00] Oh God, how I need you
[1497.00 → 1504.00] My one defence, my righteousness
[1504.00 → 1512.00] Oh God, how I need you
[1512.00 → 1514.00] Pray with me
[1514.00 → 1517.00] Father, how we need you
[1517.00 → 1520.00] Sometimes we catch ourselves telling you
[1520.00 → 1523.00] How and where you should lead us
[1523.00 → 1526.00] Forgive us for the times we didn't
[1526.00 → 1529.00] Trust you enough to rest our plans
[1529.00 → 1532.00] To rest in your plans for us
[1532.00 → 1535.00] Help us to understand your gentle
[1535.00 → 1536.00] And humble heart
[1536.00 → 1538.00] Thank you for washing us
[1538.00 → 1540.00] In your everlasting love
[1540.00 → 1544.00] Lord, will you open our eyes to your beauty
[1544.00 → 1545.00] Amen
[1545.00 → 1546.00] Amen
[1546.00 → 1566.00] We are a moment
[1566.00 → 1569.00] You are forever
[1569.00 → 1571.00] Lord of the ages
[1571.00 → 1573.00] Lord of the ages
[1573.00 → 1577.00] God before time
[1577.00 → 1581.00] We are a vapour
[1581.00 → 1585.00] You are eternal
[1585.00 → 1588.00] Love everlasting
[1588.00 → 1593.00] Reigning on high
[1593.00 → 1599.00] Holy, holy, holy
[1599.00 → 1601.00] Lord God Almighty
[1601.00 → 1604.00] Worthy earth
[1604.00 → 1608.00] The land who was saved
[1608.00 → 1612.00] High of praises
[1612.00 → 1615.00] Honour and glory
[1615.00 → 1620.00] Be unto your name
[1620.00 → 1623.00] Be unto your name
[1623.00 → 1625.00] Be unto your name
[1625.00 → 1627.00] Be unto your name
[1627.00 → 1629.00] Be unto your name
[1629.00 → 1630.00] Be unto your name
[1630.00 → 1631.00] Be unto your name
[1631.00 → 1633.00] We are the broken
[1633.00 → 1635.00] You are the healer
[1635.00 → 1637.00] Jesus' Redeemer
[1637.00 → 1644.08] Jesus, Redeemer, mighty to save.
[1644.42 → 1650.38] You are the love song, we'll sing forever.
[1651.46 → 1658.30] Bowing before you, blessed in your name.
[1659.98 → 1665.78] Holy, holy Lord God Almighty.
[1665.78 → 1673.18] Worthy is the love of one's name.
[1673.62 → 1679.82] Highest praise and honour and glory.
[1681.00 → 1685.44] Be unto your name.
[1687.16 → 1692.28] Be unto your name.
[1692.28 → 1699.68] Holy, holy Lord God Almighty.
[1700.68 → 1706.28] Worthy is the Lamb whom I sing.
[1707.42 → 1713.48] Highest praise and honour and glory.
[1713.48 → 1720.16] Be unto your name.
[1720.88 → 1727.62] Be unto your name.
[1727.62 → 1730.18] I invite you to be seated.
[1730.18 → 1731.02] Thank you.
[1731.02 → 1752.26] My husband tells me I'm still shrinking, and I can't reach this thing.
[1752.26 → 1752.62] Amen.
[1752.62 → 1752.92] Amen.
[1752.92 → 1753.08] Amen.
[1753.08 → 1753.52] Amen.
[1753.52 → 1753.62] Amen.
[1753.62 → 1753.80] Amen.
[1753.80 → 1753.90] Amen.
[1753.90 → 1755.96] Amen.
[1756.04 → 1759.16] Today's offerings are for the Budget and the Gateway of Hope.
[1759.16 → 1766.18] It is a ministry of the Salvation Army of Canada, serving the city and township of Langley.
[1766.18 → 1772.10] Because of the love of Christ, their mission is to help the homeless and those at risk.
[1772.98 → 1780.64] With material assistance and other crucial support in order to help them find hope and move forward.
[1781.42 → 1787.68] They bring a dignified, person-centred and holistic approach to their work.
[1788.30 → 1793.42] Meeting every individual with respect and without judgment or discrimination.
[1793.42 → 1799.78] Their emergency shelter and meal centre services run seven days a week.
[1800.82 → 1808.24] They are always looking for volunteers without which they could not operate on a daily basis.
[1808.86 → 1811.56] 2 Corinthians 9 says,
[1811.56 → 1816.80] Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give.
[1817.34 → 1822.62] Not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.
[1823.42 → 1853.40] 1 Corinthians 9 says,
[1853.40 → 1860.40] The still waters, you restore righteousness to me.
[1860.40 → 1869.40] Though I walk through the valley, I will fear no evil thing.
[1869.40 → 1876.40] For you are with me, and you comfort me.
[1876.40 → 1883.40] Surely goodness, love and mercy will follow wherever I go.
[1883.40 → 1892.40] Surely goodness, love and mercy will follow wherever I go.
[1892.40 → 1896.40] Surely goodness, love and mercy will follow wherever I go.
[1896.40 → 1905.80] Surely goodness, love and mercy will follow wherever I go.
[1908.38 → 1916.40] Oh Lord, you are my shepherd, you make me light in fields of green.
[1916.40 → 1925.58] You lead me by the still waters, you restore righteousness to me.
[1925.58 → 1934.32] Though I walk through the valley, I will fear no evil thing.
[1934.64 → 1941.58] For you are with me, and you are with me.
[1942.92 → 1951.98] Surely goodness, love and mercy will follow wherever I go.
[1951.98 → 1960.72] Surely goodness, love and mercy will follow wherever I go.
[1960.72 → 1969.72] Surely goodness, love and mercy will follow wherever I go.
[1969.72 → 1980.38] Oh Lord, you are my shepherd, you make me light in fields of green.
[1980.38 → 1989.12] You lead me by the still waters, you restore righteousness to me.
[1989.12 → 1998.30] Though I walk through the valley, I will fear no evil thing.
[1998.30 → 2005.10] For you are with me, and you'll comfort me.
[2005.10 → 2021.80] For you are my shepherd, you make me light in fields of green.
[2021.80 → 2024.30] Sorry, I'm being attacked by my mask here.
[2027.10 → 2037.54] So we are really excited, and we have the opportunity now to just take a moment and welcome some new members to our church family.
[2037.54 → 2043.00] And so, can I invite Louise and John and Margaret?
[2043.50 → 2044.42] John and Margaret, are you here?
[2044.48 → 2046.16] I didn't see you before.
[2046.32 → 2046.88] Oh, there we go.
[2046.96 → 2047.28] Okay, good.
[2047.90 → 2048.10] Whew.
[2048.94 → 2050.74] Tried to catch you before, but I didn't get you.
[2051.24 → 2052.60] You guys come on up to the front.
[2054.18 → 2057.20] During this season of COVID,
[2057.20 → 2062.30] COVID, there are all sorts of talk about what church membership is going to look like.
[2062.34 → 2066.76] You can just come up here right onto the stage, so the camera can see you for the people at home.
[2069.24 → 2075.02] It's been hard, and there's been all sorts of conversations about what church looks like, what membership looks like,
[2075.02 → 2080.24] and we haven't been immune to those hard conversations here,
[2081.02 → 2086.36] and yet, we've also been blessed to experience some growth in that time.
[2086.36 → 2089.68] And you guys represent some of that growth.
[2089.84 → 2093.92] And so, we are excited to welcome you into our church family and into our fellowship.
[2094.56 → 2099.96] And the way that we are doing that sort of thing here is by asking a couple questions,
[2100.46 → 2104.18] wherein you guys just give a brief testimony of your faith in response to the questions.
[2104.24 → 2105.22] I'm not asking you to talk.
[2105.66 → 2107.98] I did say that to John, and he quickly said no.
[2110.08 → 2116.32] Just as a way of expressing our shared faith and belief together.
[2116.36 → 2122.96] And so, it's our hope and prayer that in this faith community,
[2122.96 → 2125.08] your faith in God will be strengthened,
[2125.30 → 2127.48] and that your love for Jesus will be grown,
[2127.62 → 2132.10] and that here, you will find opportunity to serve in the Spirit
[2132.10 → 2137.34] as you join with us in God's mission to this community and to the world.
[2138.04 → 2140.14] As we welcome you into this church family,
[2140.14 → 2145.24] we're going to ask you to affirm the faith that you have professed and been baptized into,
[2145.44 → 2149.02] and your commitment to God's mission in and through us here.
[2149.58 → 2152.18] To do so, I'm going to ask you three questions.
[2152.30 → 2156.38] I will ask all three questions, and then just ask you to answer as we go.
[2156.70 → 2159.14] When you answer, just speak into the microphone,
[2159.70 → 2161.32] so that the people at home can hear you,
[2161.32 → 2163.88] and everyone here as well.
[2164.98 → 2168.74] First, do you believe in Jesus as your Saviour and Lord,
[2168.86 → 2173.42] and that in him alone is hope and freedom from sin found?
[2174.26 → 2178.02] Second, do you believe that the Bible is the Word of God,
[2178.12 → 2180.86] revealing his plan for redemption in Jesus Christ,
[2180.92 → 2183.12] and that the preaching and teaching of Langley,
[2183.48 → 2186.16] Emmanuel reflects this truth?
[2186.16 → 2190.84] And then third, do you promise, with the help of the Holy Spirit,
[2190.96 → 2194.68] to do all that you can to strengthen your relationship to Jesus
[2194.68 → 2198.12] by being a part of the life of this church,
[2198.86 → 2201.12] recognizing its authority and oversight,
[2201.34 → 2205.20] and joining with us on mission for Jesus in this community,
[2205.50 → 2207.46] in this city, and to the world?
[2208.56 → 2210.30] Louise, what is your answer?
[2211.46 → 2213.54] I do, with God's help.
[2213.54 → 2214.30] Amen.
[2215.34 → 2216.04] John and Margaret.
[2216.36 → 2217.06] What is your answer?
[2219.86 → 2221.32] We do, with God's help.
[2222.16 → 2223.02] She answered for me.
[2223.24 → 2224.74] She answered for you, smart man.
[2229.36 → 2232.74] I'm going to ask if you are a member here,
[2232.80 → 2234.98] or a regular worship peer here, or you attend here,
[2235.02 → 2237.30] if you consider yourself part of the church family,
[2237.58 → 2238.20] would you stand?
[2238.66 → 2239.92] And kids, that includes you.
[2243.96 → 2245.08] We're going to do the same,
[2245.08 → 2247.30] as they have made a promise to us,
[2247.30 → 2248.88] we are going to promise to them.
[2248.94 → 2250.14] And so I'm going to ask you a question,
[2250.24 → 2251.62] and I just invite you to respond,
[2252.04 → 2253.78] we do, with God's help.
[2254.34 → 2256.56] And so do you, church family of Langley,
[2256.64 → 2259.32] Emmanuel, promise to embrace these people
[2259.32 → 2261.88] as part of our family of God,
[2262.04 → 2263.76] and serving them,
[2263.82 → 2265.28] and serving with them,
[2265.28 → 2266.88] as the Spirit moves?
[2266.88 → 2267.68] What is your answer?
[2267.68 → 2267.70] What is your answer?
[2270.90 → 2272.44] We do, with God's help.
[2272.54 → 2273.44] We do, God's helping us.
[2273.48 → 2275.42] There's some legacy CRC people in the room.
[2275.76 → 2276.36] I love it.
[2277.50 → 2279.28] Thank you all very much,
[2279.28 → 2281.38] and congratulations to you guys.
[2281.38 → 2284.14] I encourage you, following the service,
[2284.52 → 2286.02] if you haven't introduced yourself
[2286.02 → 2287.56] to any of these three,
[2287.66 → 2288.24] to do so.
[2288.56 → 2289.36] Be responsible,
[2289.80 → 2292.76] and gauge people's own assessment
[2292.76 → 2294.50] of their risk in physical distancing,
[2294.68 → 2295.20] and the like,
[2295.32 → 2298.24] but welcome them into our fellowship.
[2298.56 → 2299.30] And to you three,
[2299.76 → 2300.36] God bless,
[2300.78 → 2301.36] and welcome.
[2301.36 → 2313.50] As the kids are making their way up,
[2314.02 → 2316.06] I just want to throw this out there.
[2316.18 → 2317.86] If you have been worshipping with us,
[2317.86 → 2319.76] and you want to have a conversation
[2319.76 → 2321.14] about membership,
[2321.42 → 2323.28] or joining more closely with our fellowship,
[2323.46 → 2324.78] and if you've been doing that online,
[2324.88 → 2325.52] from a distance,
[2326.08 → 2327.64] please go to our website.
[2327.92 → 2329.80] You can find our contact information there,
[2329.92 → 2330.74] mine specifically,
[2330.74 → 2331.76] reach out,
[2331.82 → 2332.48] and we can talk,
[2332.60 → 2334.92] and see what God has in store for all of us.
[2335.26 → 2335.62] Thank you.
[2339.64 → 2340.68] Good morning, everybody.
[2341.02 → 2342.48] I didn't have to ask you to come up.
[2342.48 → 2342.76] So,
[2344.12 → 2345.18] today in kids,
[2345.44 → 2347.38] in children's worship time,
[2347.50 → 2350.30] we're going to talk about something called faith.
[2350.66 → 2352.70] I'm wondering if any of you can tell me
[2352.70 → 2353.96] what that word means.
[2354.16 → 2355.66] You've probably heard it at church,
[2355.94 → 2356.66] at home.
[2357.22 → 2358.50] Does anyone know what faith means?
[2358.98 → 2359.68] What do you think, Zoe?
[2359.68 → 2360.16] Um,
[2360.68 → 2362.92] believing in God.
[2363.24 → 2364.04] Believing in God.
[2365.36 → 2366.92] Anyone else have any ideas?
[2367.50 → 2367.96] Yep, Caleb.
[2369.30 → 2369.66] Trusting.
[2370.42 → 2371.10] Good answers.
[2371.18 → 2371.28] Now,
[2371.36 → 2372.04] I have a question.
[2372.18 → 2374.98] Can you have faith in the wrong thing?
[2376.08 → 2376.44] No?
[2376.60 → 2376.80] Okay,
[2376.86 → 2378.42] I'm going to give you a little demonstration.
[2379.18 → 2379.52] So,
[2379.62 → 2380.02] Ruby,
[2380.18 → 2380.76] can you help me?
[2382.32 → 2382.68] Okay,
[2382.86 → 2383.64] this is my question.
[2383.76 → 2383.92] So,
[2383.98 → 2385.28] I'm going to give you two scenarios,
[2385.42 → 2386.36] and you're going to tell me
[2386.36 → 2387.66] which one makes more sense.
[2388.28 → 2388.50] So,
[2388.60 → 2388.78] Ruby,
[2388.84 → 2390.60] I want you to stand right here.
[2391.20 → 2391.96] Turn and face me.
[2395.64 → 2396.04] Okay,
[2396.30 → 2396.60] now,
[2396.72 → 2398.10] I'm going to do something really fun.
[2398.56 → 2399.88] I'm going to jump off,
[2400.14 → 2401.94] and Ruby is going to catch me.
[2402.52 → 2402.82] Okay?
[2402.82 → 2404.98] I have faith that she can do this.
[2405.06 → 2405.38] I really,
[2405.50 → 2406.22] I think she can.
[2406.58 → 2408.64] I trust that she's not going to want me to fall.
[2408.72 → 2409.18] I'm going to jump,
[2409.24 → 2410.12] and she's going to catch me.
[2410.56 → 2410.78] Okay?
[2411.10 → 2411.68] Who thinks,
[2411.78 → 2412.90] who thinks I should try that?
[2416.14 → 2416.50] Yeah?
[2416.68 → 2417.38] Do you think so?
[2418.06 → 2418.42] Okay,
[2418.58 → 2418.74] now,
[2418.82 → 2419.78] let's try something else.
[2421.14 → 2421.50] Now,
[2421.60 → 2421.78] Ruby,
[2421.82 → 2422.80] I want you to come up here.
[2422.80 → 2423.28] Okay,
[2423.28 → 2426.34] now,
[2426.44 → 2427.10] I'm going to ask,
[2427.46 → 2428.18] if Ruby jumped,
[2428.28 → 2429.36] to jump off of this,
[2429.88 → 2430.86] and I will catch her.
[2431.36 → 2432.20] Who thinks that?
[2432.40 → 2432.76] Does she,
[2432.90 → 2433.06] Ruby,
[2433.12 → 2434.18] do you have faith that if you jump,
[2434.24 → 2434.80] I'll catch you?
[2435.34 → 2435.70] Yeah?
[2435.96 → 2437.06] She has faith that I'll catch you.
[2437.08 → 2438.14] Do you think that makes sense?
[2438.98 → 2439.38] Yeah?
[2440.30 → 2440.68] Okay,
[2440.70 → 2441.30] you can jump down.
[2442.58 → 2444.40] I can't really catch you with one hand,
[2444.50 → 2445.62] but with two hands,
[2445.68 → 2446.02] I would.
[2446.68 → 2446.98] So,
[2447.18 → 2448.92] can you have faith in something
[2448.92 → 2449.84] that isn't,
[2449.94 → 2451.08] doesn't really make sense?
[2451.98 → 2452.38] Yeah,
[2452.38 → 2452.76] like,
[2453.00 → 2453.50] you can,
[2453.88 → 2454.06] right?
[2454.10 → 2456.08] If I really believe that Ruby will catch me,
[2456.12 → 2456.66] and I jump,
[2457.22 → 2458.12] and Is mush her,
[2458.72 → 2461.10] that wasn't really a good idea to have faith in that,
[2461.70 → 2461.98] right?
[2462.72 → 2463.12] But,
[2463.24 → 2464.86] if Ruby has faith that I'll catch her,
[2464.92 → 2466.38] because she knows she can trust me,
[2466.44 → 2467.80] and that I'm strong enough to catch her,
[2467.86 → 2469.60] then that's a good place to put our faith.
[2470.26 → 2470.66] So,
[2470.76 → 2472.70] we're going to talk about having faith in Jesus,
[2473.36 → 2476.66] and I think you all would agree that that's a good place to put our faith.
[2476.90 → 2479.18] And we have two examples in our story today,
[2479.18 → 2481.40] of people who also showed that in the Bible.
[2481.40 → 2482.22] So,
[2482.30 → 2483.14] let's pray together,
[2483.34 → 2484.48] and then we'll do the blessing.
[2485.90 → 2486.58] Lord Jesus,
[2486.72 → 2488.96] we thank you so much that we can have faith in you,
[2489.10 → 2490.26] that we can trust you,
[2490.60 → 2492.34] and that you are our God.
[2492.86 → 2493.96] Please open our hearts,
[2494.10 → 2494.96] and our ears,
[2495.08 → 2495.88] and our eyes,
[2495.94 → 2497.32] as we learn more about you,
[2497.86 → 2499.02] in children's worship time,
[2499.06 → 2499.82] and in church today.
[2500.12 → 2500.38] Amen.
[2500.38 → 2502.56] All right.
[2502.64 → 2502.74] So,
[2502.80 → 2504.28] I invite everyone to stand up.
[2506.72 → 2508.06] We're going to face this way.
[2511.28 → 2511.68] Ready?
[2511.68 → 2511.74] Ready?
[2512.80 → 2515.12] The Lord is in the air.
[2515.84 → 2516.56] Amen.
[2516.56 → 2516.70] Amen.
[2516.70 → 2516.80] Amen.
[2516.80 → 2517.16] Amen.
[2517.16 → 2517.30] Amen.
[2517.30 → 2517.36] Amen.
[2517.36 → 2517.38] Amen.
[2517.38 → 2518.38] Amen.
[2518.38 → 2519.38] Amen.
[2519.38 → 2520.38] Amen.
[2520.38 → 2521.38] Amen.
[2521.38 → 2522.38] Amen.
[2522.38 → 2523.38] Amen.
[2523.38 → 2524.38] Amen.
[2524.38 → 2525.38] Amen.
[2525.38 → 2526.38] Amen.
[2526.38 → 2527.38] Amen.
[2527.38 → 2528.38] Amen.
[2528.38 → 2529.38] Amen.
[2529.38 → 2530.36] Amen.
[2530.38 → 2531.38] Amen.
[2539.18 → 2539.58] Amen.
[2539.58 → 2539.76] Amen.
[2539.76 → 2540.28] Amen.
[2540.28 → 2540.46] Amen.
[2540.46 → 2540.82] Amen.
[2540.82 → 2541.88] Good morning, everybody.
[2542.48 → 2543.32] My name is Ken.
[2543.32 → 2544.94] I'm an elder here at Emmanuel,
[2545.18 → 2548.96] and I have the privilege of leading you in our church family prayer,
[2549.12 → 2550.84] so let's go to God together.
[2553.30 → 2554.76] Merciful God and Heavenly Father,
[2555.48 → 2557.56] Lord, you are worthy of all thanks and praise.
[2558.18 → 2559.86] We come to you now as your people.
[2560.38 → 2569.52] We come to this place to sing praise to you, to worship you, to be with each other, and to hear from you, to listen to your word preached.
[2570.12 → 2579.82] It is a wonderful gift we have to come here every Sunday, or to hear from you from our living rooms, depending on the circumstances, and we thank you for it.
[2580.44 → 2586.20] We praise you for this gift of freedom we have as a country in Canada, to serve you without fear of persecution.
[2587.20 → 2589.86] We pray for those around the world who do not have this freedom.
[2590.38 → 2592.64] Those who are persecuted for your namesake.
[2593.54 → 2599.18] Those who continue to gather for worship and study, even though they can face severe penalties or even death.
[2599.88 → 2603.22] Keep them strong in you, that they may continue to fight the battle of faith.
[2604.70 → 2607.92] Father, another week has passed, in which so many things of life have happened.
[2608.26 → 2610.42] Work, school, all kinds of activities.
[2611.16 → 2614.20] People moving, people travelling, sporting events, and the like.
[2615.08 → 2618.74] For some, it was a typical busy week with certain joys and happiness abounding.
[2618.74 → 2624.98] For others, it was a hard week, a struggle to make it through, a fight of mental or physical pain.
[2625.90 → 2634.12] Father, we think of Miriam Kisser, who is experiencing symptoms similar to the seizures again, and is waiting for a treatment plan from the doctors.
[2634.12 → 2643.12] We pray for answers to Miriam's symptoms, and for a quick process and turnaround in her symptoms, and peace during anxious moments while waiting.
[2644.28 → 2647.68] We pray for those who are continuing to mourn the loss of loved ones.
[2648.46 → 2655.28] Grant them comfort and peace in the nearness of Christ through the fellowship of the church family in the days and weeks ahead.
[2655.28 → 2662.40] Father, comfort those who are elderly, those who are lonely, those whose days and weeks are not so easy,
[2662.92 → 2667.16] not filled with the joy of life, but rather filled with worry, pain, suffering, and struggle.
[2668.04 → 2671.58] You are the only true peace on earth, and we pray for your nearness to them.
[2673.02 → 2675.78] We pray for Jared Alcoa, who is travelling to Costa Rica,
[2676.12 → 2680.38] to serve with Catenary in a leadership development and mission program for the next four months.
[2680.38 → 2683.90] May you bless him and use him to further your kingdom work.
[2685.88 → 2688.12] Father, we pray for this CRC denomination,
[2688.58 → 2692.72] as there will be a conversation about leadership and direction on a national level.
[2693.42 → 2696.52] We pray for your blessing on the plans that come out of this conversation.
[2697.64 → 2701.44] And we also pray that you will provide a new executive director for the denomination.
[2702.22 → 2706.80] We pray for Pastor Chris, as he heads up the committee which is tasked with finding this new person,
[2707.42 → 2709.06] and that you will bless him in his work there.
[2709.06 → 2715.88] Father, we give thanks to you for your healing mercies in the lives of Kevin and Colleen Breed veld.
[2716.76 → 2719.68] Even though they were in a car crash and suffered critical injuries,
[2719.94 → 2722.38] they were both able to go home and receive care there.
[2723.10 → 2728.22] We pray for continued patience and perseverance as they continue to heal both physically and emotionally.
[2729.86 → 2735.78] We also give thanks to you this day for the new memberships of Luis Condos and John and Margaret Struck.
[2735.78 → 2741.46] We pray for them, that they will feel at home here, that they will be active and living members of this congregation,
[2742.26 → 2746.38] and that we, as a congregation, may make them feel welcome and loved here.
[2748.04 → 2750.72] Father, continue to watch over your church here in Durbanville.
[2751.38 → 2754.74] Be with the leadership of this church and the council.
[2755.16 → 2760.92] Be with every committee, Bible study, care group, and any other gatherings of this church for the benefit of your people.
[2760.92 → 2766.54] Be with Pastor Chris this morning as he brings us your word.
[2767.16 → 2771.36] Give him your strength and spirit as we learn more about how to live in your will and way.
[2772.14 → 2775.58] Be with us this day and grant us all a day of peace and rest in you.
[2776.32 → 2778.62] We pray all of this in Jesus' name. Amen.
[2778.62 → 2779.62] Amen.
[2779.62 → 2780.62] Amen.
[2780.62 → 2781.62] Amen.
[2781.62 → 2782.62] Amen.
[2808.62 → 2809.60] Good morning.
[2809.74 → 2815.42] We are continuing with our look at the book of Exodus.
[2817.34 → 2823.08] If you're visiting with us or if you haven't been here for a while or if you're just checking us out online for the first time,
[2823.66 → 2828.38] we've been looking at this, the second book of the Bible, the book of Exodus,
[2829.56 → 2832.42] which is part of what's called the Old Testament.
[2832.42 → 2838.76] Old Testament means that it records the history of redemption that took place before the coming
[2838.76 → 2846.02] of Jesus. Exodus is also part of the Pentateuch which is the first five books of the Bible that
[2846.02 → 2852.54] sometimes called the Torah so just to get us situated there. Bible begins in the book of
[2852.54 → 2859.00] Genesis and at the end of Genesis God's people the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are
[2859.00 → 2865.42] living in Egypt because of a famine in the land of Canaan where they were previously situated.
[2866.26 → 2873.38] Joseph, one of the sons of Jacob, has become a leader in Egypt and God provides for his family
[2873.38 → 2880.22] through him. Now fast-forward between the end of Genesis and the beginning of Exodus some 400 years
[2880.22 → 2888.14] passes and the king of Egypt called Pharaoh has forgotten Joseph and the history that came before.
[2889.00 → 2895.02] And all through that time the Israelites have been incredibly fruitful and have multiplied. They
[2895.02 → 2904.22] have grown to a huge group of people. Scared of their size, Pharaoh orders the death of all the newborn
[2904.22 → 2915.64] boys in attempt to stem the tide of population growth. Now one boy escapes genocide. He ends up being
[2915.64 → 2924.94] rescued by Pharaoh's daughter raised in the palace as a prince of Egypt, yet he is an Israelite. This boy
[2924.94 → 2933.06] Moses grows up and then one day while touring the lands he sees an Egyptian guard beating an Israelite
[2933.06 → 2938.68] slave, and he intervenes, and he kills that guard and so fearing for his life because Pharaoh has
[2938.68 → 2946.76] found out he flees into the wilderness. Now there in the wilderness he protects a group of women who were
[2946.76 → 2952.52] trying to draw water. They were taking care of their father's sheep. He eventually marries one of those women
[2952.52 → 2960.86] named Zipper and for 40 years Moses shepherds the flocks of Jethro, his father-in-law. While he is doing
[2960.86 → 2966.78] that work is when he encountered God in the burning bush. That's the text that Pastor Kevin led us in
[2966.78 → 2973.58] last week if he was here. At the end of that text where God tells Moses, commissions him to go and
[2973.58 → 2981.04] speak to Pharaoh, he complains to God that he can't do it and so God gives him a promise that he would go
[2981.04 → 2986.52] with him one and that he would send with him Aaron, right? God gives the Holy Spirit, and he gives a
[2986.52 → 2995.82] community wherein we can work out our calling through. So Moses goes back to Egypt perhaps reluctantly
[2995.82 → 3002.98] to tell Pharaoh to let the people go so that they might worship God, and you'll remember that
[3002.98 → 3012.34] God's people worshipping him rightly is a central theme of the book of Exodus. Now Pharaoh however
[3012.34 → 3019.38] does not care, and he doesn't like the idea. He wants to keep the people working and to not
[3019.38 → 3027.26] be distracted. And so as we read today from the end of chapter 5, let me set that context before we
[3027.26 → 3035.50] dig in. I'm going to look quickly at verse 6 before we read the text that will be on the screen.
[3036.96 → 3042.54] That same day Pharaoh gave this order to the slave drivers and overseers in charge of the people.
[3042.54 → 3048.98] You are no longer to supply the people with straw for making bricks. Let them go gather their own
[3048.98 → 3055.52] straw but require them to make the same number of bricks as before. Do not reduce the quota. They are
[3055.52 → 3062.32] lazy. That's why they're crying out. Let us go and sacrifice to our God. Make the work harder for the
[3062.32 → 3070.90] people so that they keep working and pay no attention to lies. Now eventually the Israelite leaders in the
[3070.90 → 3077.96] community and the overseers, they go to plea with Pharaoh in order to make their work easier again
[3077.96 → 3083.84] but Pharaoh doubles down, and he keeps the work hard for them and the quota the same. And so those leaders
[3083.84 → 3092.12] having failed with Pharaoh go find Moses and Aaron, and then they say, verse 21,
[3092.12 → 3100.18] may the Lord look on you and judge you. You have made us obnoxious to Pharaoh and his officials have
[3100.18 → 3108.36] put a sword in their hand to kill us. And so in that big story and then that little context we come to
[3108.36 → 3116.40] the text of our focus today starting in verse 22 of chapter 5. I encourage you to read along with me.
[3116.40 → 3125.76] Moses, remember having been queued out by the leaders, Moses returned to the Lord and said,
[3127.20 → 3135.08] why Lord, why have you brought trouble on this people? Is this why you sent me? Ever since I went
[3135.08 → 3141.92] to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble to this people, and you have not rescued your
[3141.92 → 3151.72] people at all. Then the Lord said to Moses, now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh because of my
[3151.72 → 3158.14] mighty hand, he will let them go because of my mighty hand, he will drive them out of his country.
[3159.94 → 3170.30] God also said to Moses, I am the Lord. I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, to Jacob as God almighty,
[3170.30 → 3178.76] but by my name, the Lord, I did not make myself fully known to them. I also established my covenant
[3178.76 → 3187.98] with them to give them the land of Canaan where they resided as foreigners. Moreover, I have heard
[3187.98 → 3195.38] the groaning of the Israelites whom the Egyptians are enslaving. I have remembered my covenant.
[3195.38 → 3206.72] Therefore, say to the Israelites, I am the Lord and I will bring you out from under the yoke of the
[3206.72 → 3213.22] Egyptians. I will free you from being slaves to them and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm
[3213.22 → 3221.84] and with mighty acts of judgment. I will take you as my own people and I will be your God. Then you
[3221.84 → 3227.50] will know that I am the Lord, your God who brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians and I
[3227.50 → 3233.22] will bring you to the land I swore with uplifted hand to give to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob.
[3233.56 → 3242.90] I will give it to you as a possession. I am the Lord. Moses reported this to the Israelites,
[3243.48 → 3248.28] but they did not listen to him because of their discouragement and harsh labour.
[3248.28 → 3258.18] The Lord said to Moses, go tell Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to let the Israelites go out of this country.
[3258.98 → 3266.20] But Moses said to the Lord, if the Israelites will not listen to me, why would Pharaoh listen to me
[3266.20 → 3272.76] since I speak with faltering lips? This is the word of the Lord.
[3278.28 → 3287.48] So we're at the point in the story where things go from bad to worse. And when they go from bad to
[3287.48 → 3295.36] worse, the people blame Moses. And then what's more, Moses, as their leader, takes on their own
[3295.36 → 3302.42] frustration as his own, and then he directs that frustration at God. And now it's God's response
[3302.42 → 3309.94] to Moses and his frustration that we're going to look at and focus on today. What I hope you will
[3309.94 → 3316.98] see is that God shows us that God's covenant identity and his covenant promises are a source
[3316.98 → 3324.58] of strength and encouragement when things go from bad to worse, right? When things seem to be falling
[3324.58 → 3333.72] apart around you, look to God's covenant identity, to who he is, to his covenant promises, right? What he does
[3333.72 → 3341.98] and says that he will do. When your life is in chaos after chaos, right? It is the person,
[3342.14 → 3349.56] the nature and character, and it is the activity of God in the world that can buoy you through,
[3349.56 → 3355.46] right? He is our refuge and strength, says the psalmist, and ever-present help in times of trouble.
[3357.12 → 3363.54] And so we'll get there. But before we get there, I want to start with something from Moses.
[3364.68 → 3375.04] Now notice how Moses receives the anxiety of the Israelite leaders and then makes it his own,
[3375.04 → 3382.72] right? You had me, we started in 21, may the Lord look on you and judge you. You have made us obnoxious
[3382.72 → 3390.00] to Pharaoh. And then that leads to Moses in verse 22 saying, why have you brought trouble on this? Is
[3390.00 → 3397.66] this why you sent me here? Ever since I went to tell Pharaoh to speak to in your name, he's brought
[3397.66 → 3402.58] trouble on these people, and you have not rescued your people at all.
[3402.58 → 3414.82] Here is a man who stood before a bush ablaze but wouldn't be consumed. And here is a man to whom
[3414.82 → 3423.58] the voice of God spoke audibly out of that bush to him. Here is the man whom God revealed his very
[3423.58 → 3437.40] covenant name, Yahweh, I am, I am who I am, too. And yet, he gives in to their anxiety, and he makes it his own.
[3439.16 → 3443.96] And let me be clear, right? Because Moses isn't afraid of conflict.
[3446.14 → 3450.90] Moses killed an Egyptian slave driver with his bare hands when that slave driver was beating another
[3450.90 → 3457.06] Israelite, right? Moses intervened and protected the family of Zipper when shepherds came and were
[3457.06 → 3465.38] mistreating them, right? He's not afraid to get in people's faces. And I think it's important to remember
[3465.38 → 3473.56] that fact about Moses, that he's not afraid of conflict when he gives his excuses of not being a
[3473.56 → 3481.96] good speaker. Because he is a fighter, right? He's not a coward. He's a leader. I want to suggest that
[3481.96 → 3488.56] maybe his excuses are more about his own fears or his own anxiety, either adopted or from within,
[3489.20 → 3499.72] than it is the reality of his stammering tongue. And he does the same thing here, right? He doesn't lead
[3499.72 → 3508.50] in the face of the people's anxiety. He takes it on. Furthermore, he makes it his own. And so just quickly, I want to
[3508.50 → 3514.26] talk to you people who are here and listening right now who are leaders, right? Whether you are a leader
[3514.26 → 3520.14] in church or at work or in school or if school is your work, whether you are a leader on a board
[3520.14 → 3525.52] somewhere or if you are in public service or an elected official or whether you are leaders in your
[3525.52 → 3536.40] neighbourhood. Good leaders don't take on the anxiety of their people. Let me say that again. Good leaders
[3536.40 → 3543.16] don't take on the anxiety of the people that they are leading. Now, you represent them, and you articulate
[3543.16 → 3550.32] those anxieties, and you be present with the people who are experiencing those anxieties. But if you are a
[3550.32 → 3558.64] leader, it is your job somehow to stand above their anxiety, right? You can't manage other people's anxieties.
[3559.96 → 3568.18] Now, sometimes we think that we can lessen a person's experience of anxiety by taking it from them and
[3568.18 → 3576.14] putting it on our own shoulders, right? That somehow we are then sharing the load. But that doesn't actually
[3576.14 → 3582.98] have the effect of lessening the anxiety. It just spreads it out more, right? It makes it more pervasive.
[3584.94 → 3591.84] I did a leadership training course a few years ago and the course spanned six years of my life.
[3592.88 → 3597.82] And one of the tenets, one of the sort of principles of that leadership training program
[3597.82 → 3603.82] was this statement, this axiom. It said, anxiety makes you stupid.
[3603.82 → 3612.56] Is someone applauding over there? Because that's absolutely the case. Anxiety makes you stupid. And
[3612.56 → 3617.84] you don't realize just how stupid you are when you are anxious because you can't see it.
[3619.46 → 3624.72] Now, to be clear, when I say this, I'm talking about the anxiety that's common to us all. I'm not
[3624.72 → 3630.66] talking about generalized anxiety disorder. I'm not talking about other anxiety disorders that will
[3630.66 → 3635.42] have different roots and different treatments and I will leave those roots and treatments to good,
[3635.72 → 3641.90] faithful counsellors and psychologists. Talking about the anxiety that exists in our system.
[3643.28 → 3648.82] When you're anxious about something, you're not thinking clearly. When you're anxious about
[3648.82 → 3654.44] something, you can't see the bigger picture because whatever is in front of you is all consuming.
[3654.44 → 3664.48] A good leader will learn how to recognize and manage her own anxiety and be a non-anxious presence in the
[3664.48 → 3673.10] midst of high anxiety and high tension. And so leaders, hear this. You cannot take away other people's
[3673.10 → 3679.56] anxieties. All you can do is manage your own in the midst of that tension.
[3679.56 → 3692.44] But managing your own anxiety will have the effect of cancelling out or of making less the anxiety of
[3692.44 → 3699.22] those around you, right? Of those whom you are leading. And so as we dig into this text, let me start
[3699.22 → 3707.54] with this. Leaders don't be like Moses. Don't borrow worry or anxiety from people around you.
[3707.54 → 3714.36] Second, look at what Moses does with his anxiety.
[3718.00 → 3721.40] Why, Lord? Why have you brought trouble on this people?
[3723.44 → 3733.48] Lord, right? He prays. He goes to God, right? God wants your frustration. He wants your anxiety. God wants
[3733.48 → 3738.42] you to come to him with the whole gamut of your emotional realities.
[3740.42 → 3744.52] And sometimes we go around thinking,
[3744.86 → 3748.60] oh, you can't talk to God like that.
[3749.34 → 3752.28] You can't be angry at God. That's not respectful.
[3752.62 → 3754.98] That's not the way you talk to the creator of the world.
[3755.20 → 3758.56] And look, I get the intent behind that, right?
[3758.56 → 3762.24] Or at least I can come up with a charitable interpretation that makes it understandable.
[3763.44 → 3764.48] But here's the thing.
[3765.48 → 3774.80] It is important. It is critical that you go to God with your anger or anxiety or worries or doubts
[3774.80 → 3780.38] or questions or frustrations rather than ignore him or hide from him, right?
[3780.38 → 3786.18] Especially if you're keeping those feelings from God because of some wrong sense of piety.
[3788.18 → 3793.18] Your frustration, no matter how great it is, will not frustrate God.
[3794.64 → 3796.98] Right? God won't take on your anxiety.
[3798.22 → 3799.76] His shoulders are big enough.
[3800.14 → 3802.42] He can hear it. He can assess it with you.
[3802.50 → 3805.08] And he can give it back, maybe transformed or diminished.
[3805.08 → 3810.60] Right? God is bigger than your fear, and he wants to hear from you in the midst of it.
[3811.48 → 3816.72] God is actually inviting you to take the fullness of who you are,
[3817.24 → 3818.72] whatever that is, right?
[3818.78 → 3822.14] Your fears and your dreams, your hopes and your failures, your struggles and your worries,
[3822.26 → 3825.90] your joys and your successes, all your identity questions,
[3826.22 → 3828.86] all of who you are, the fullness of who you are,
[3828.86 → 3834.02] God wants to hear from you so that you can bring it to the fullness of who he is.
[3835.08 → 3839.94] He is the right one to go to with your anxiety.
[3841.08 → 3843.84] And so on the one hand, we said, leaders, don't be like Moses.
[3844.04 → 3848.32] Don't worry or don't borrow worry and anxiety from the people around you,
[3848.34 → 3849.54] from the system that you are in.
[3849.76 → 3852.26] And yet also be like Moses.
[3853.56 → 3856.86] Go to God when you have anxieties and frustrations.
[3856.86 → 3862.58] Cry out to him as the only one who can do anything about everything in your life.
[3862.58 → 3871.54] And then allow God to hold your own heart back to you,
[3871.62 → 3873.90] to hold your own words back to you.
[3874.02 → 3880.00] Allow God to expose the truth of your anxiety to the truth of his gospel.
[3880.00 → 3884.26] So let's do that together with Moses' words.
[3885.20 → 3887.92] Why, Lord, have you brought trouble on this people?
[3888.24 → 3889.58] Is that why you sent me?
[3890.42 → 3892.94] Ever since I went back to Pharaoh to speak in your name,
[3893.08 → 3898.20] he has brought trouble on this people, and you have not rescued their people at all.
[3898.38 → 3900.32] Ever since I went to Pharaoh.
[3900.32 → 3903.72] I mean, he just did go to Pharaoh.
[3905.00 → 3905.42] Right?
[3905.46 → 3910.20] But he elevates, he exaggerates, he makes it bigger, and he makes it more pressing.
[3910.38 → 3913.48] And anxiety has a tendency to do that to us.
[3914.74 → 3915.22] Right?
[3915.28 → 3918.58] We take significant things, but we inflate them.
[3919.68 → 3923.00] We take less significant things, and we make them more than they are.
[3923.00 → 3930.78] He has brought trouble on all his people, and you have not rescued your people at all.
[3932.40 → 3937.02] Moses wanted immediate action.
[3940.14 → 3946.00] Most of us, when we are facing a trial or a struggle that brings anxiety or fear or worry,
[3946.20 → 3948.44] we want immediate action.
[3948.44 → 3958.20] Moses couldn't see, or his anxiety wouldn't let him see the bigger picture.
[3958.92 → 3959.52] Right?
[3959.52 → 3963.38] Or he forgot that there is a bigger plan of God here at work.
[3963.94 → 3966.06] Yes, we've said it already, right?
[3966.16 → 3971.12] This is about the people of Israel being able to worship God rightly.
[3971.88 → 3977.04] But it's not ultimately about worshipping God in the wilderness outside of Egypt.
[3977.04 → 3977.52] Right?
[3978.04 → 3982.84] But it's about worshipping God in their home of God's promise back in Canaan.
[3983.30 → 3983.42] Right?
[3983.50 → 3985.64] Promise to Abraham and to Isaac and to Jacob.
[3985.90 → 3989.42] This isn't about escaping Egypt for a weekend getaway.
[3990.78 → 3996.92] This is about freedom to be and to become their own nation in their own land as their own people.
[3998.66 → 4002.48] And what's more, and we'll come back to this more in a moment, right?
[4002.48 → 4010.72] This is about setting up themes and types and shadows and patterns and historical circumstances that will ultimately culminate in Jesus,
[4011.14 → 4013.42] God's ultimate plan for ultimate redemption.
[4013.90 → 4014.02] Right?
[4014.06 → 4016.66] That's at work in this story too.
[4020.68 → 4025.76] You've heard me say it before, but it bears repeating over and over and over again.
[4025.76 → 4029.72] God wants your anger, and he wants your frustration.
[4029.90 → 4032.20] He wants your anxiety and your worry.
[4032.60 → 4037.04] Come to him in your rage and in your frustration and in prayer and in devotion.
[4037.86 → 4040.36] But remember this.
[4040.36 → 4054.00] If you want a God who is big enough to be angry at when things go wrong, he must also be big enough to have reasons that are beyond your comprehension.
[4056.14 → 4056.62] Right?
[4056.66 → 4065.72] If God is big enough to handle your pain, he must also be big enough to fill that pain full of purpose and meaning in his divine plan.
[4065.72 → 4072.80] And yes, you may never know how this side of heaven, maybe even after.
[4073.64 → 4076.52] But you can know that he has one.
[4077.26 → 4078.62] And that it is good.
[4079.06 → 4079.16] Right?
[4079.18 → 4080.88] It is always good.
[4080.96 → 4084.64] And that it is for your good and for his glory.
[4085.26 → 4085.44] Right?
[4085.46 → 4088.90] If our God is for us, who can be against us?
[4089.12 → 4089.22] Right?
[4089.28 → 4094.28] God works for good all things for those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.
[4094.28 → 4105.46] And so maybe if today you are crying out for the immediate action of God in your anxiety or worry or fear,
[4105.82 → 4110.64] maybe you need to hear that God's got you.
[4111.92 → 4114.36] He will never leave you or forsake you.
[4114.36 → 4127.28] But for him to be a God who's got you, he and thereby his action in the world must be bigger than your understanding.
[4128.96 → 4131.02] He's got you no matter what.
[4132.88 → 4137.64] But for that to be true, you also have to accept that you might not know how.
[4137.64 → 4140.96] But he does.
[4144.96 → 4148.20] And even though God is ultimately bigger than our understanding,
[4148.90 → 4152.36] I also want to say that doesn't mean we don't have any understanding.
[4154.76 → 4154.96] Right?
[4155.02 → 4159.44] He makes sure to give us something while we wait.
[4160.06 → 4160.20] Right?
[4160.20 → 4169.10] He gives us his covenant name and his identity and his covenant promise.
[4170.02 → 4172.90] So let's look at God's response to Moses then.
[4177.54 → 4178.86] Chapter 6, verse 2.
[4179.38 → 4180.04] God says,
[4180.04 → 4183.78] I am the Lord.
[4186.38 → 4189.00] I am the Lord.
[4190.14 → 4191.36] And then in verse 6,
[4192.28 → 4193.66] I am the Lord.
[4193.78 → 4196.36] I will bring you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians.
[4197.50 → 4201.68] And then he ends that whole section of his speech to Moses by saying,
[4201.90 → 4204.52] I am the Lord.
[4204.52 → 4209.12] There's something special.
[4210.20 → 4210.56] God says,
[4210.68 → 4211.46] I am the Lord.
[4211.56 → 4212.36] In verse 3,
[4212.74 → 4215.42] I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, to Jacob as God Almighty,
[4215.56 → 4217.76] but by my name, the Lord,
[4217.88 → 4219.82] I did not make myself known to them.
[4220.10 → 4224.04] There's something special about knowing God's name.
[4224.56 → 4224.76] Right?
[4224.80 → 4226.82] There's a personal aspect,
[4227.04 → 4229.02] a depth of relationship.
[4229.02 → 4234.70] To give someone your name is to give them access to you.
[4236.50 → 4237.74] That's what God does.
[4238.34 → 4240.10] He gives us his name.
[4240.22 → 4242.28] And then he signs his name.
[4242.38 → 4245.32] At the end of this list of promises in verse 8,
[4245.40 → 4245.64] he says,
[4245.80 → 4247.86] I am the Lord.
[4248.54 → 4249.66] I am the Lord.
[4249.76 → 4251.82] I will not give my glory to another.
[4251.92 → 4252.58] Not to Pharaoh,
[4252.86 → 4253.58] not to Egypt,
[4253.72 → 4254.50] not to anxiety,
[4254.76 → 4255.46] not to worry.
[4255.46 → 4257.50] I am worth the weight,
[4257.66 → 4259.26] W-A-I-T,
[4259.74 → 4262.00] and I am worth the weight,
[4262.14 → 4264.32] W-E-G-H-T,
[4264.48 → 4266.02] W-E-I-G-H-T.
[4266.38 → 4267.58] Spelling was never my strong suit.
[4269.26 → 4269.44] Right?
[4269.50 → 4270.46] I am worth the weight,
[4270.56 → 4272.04] and I am worth the weight,
[4272.18 → 4272.76] God says.
[4272.90 → 4273.90] In Hebrew,
[4274.78 → 4278.22] one of the words that is translated to English as glory
[4278.22 → 4280.08] literally means weight,
[4280.86 → 4282.06] literally means heavy.
[4283.04 → 4283.24] Right?
[4283.24 → 4287.30] God can handle the weight of whatever you put on him
[4287.30 → 4290.06] because he is the ultimate weighty one.
[4290.78 → 4293.94] He is the glorious one in whom is our delight.
[4294.18 → 4298.26] His name matters because it is connected to his identity.
[4298.76 → 4298.86] Right?
[4298.90 → 4299.38] God says,
[4299.66 → 4300.38] I am.
[4300.78 → 4303.04] I am who I am.
[4303.14 → 4304.82] What this reveals to us is,
[4305.18 → 4307.14] Pastor Kevin led us in that,
[4307.22 → 4309.82] is God's unchanging nature.
[4309.82 → 4314.08] God is the same yesterday,
[4314.34 → 4314.74] today,
[4314.74 → 4315.74] and tomorrow.
[4315.94 → 4317.70] In theological language,
[4318.00 → 4320.14] we call this God's immutability,
[4320.70 → 4323.02] his unmeaningness.
[4323.26 → 4325.18] He does not change.
[4326.34 → 4328.72] And this unchanging God
[4328.72 → 4331.40] makes a promise to you.
[4331.82 → 4333.52] I am says,
[4333.52 → 4334.68] I will do.
[4336.24 → 4337.98] I am says,
[4337.98 → 4342.66] I have established my covenant with them
[4342.66 → 4344.94] to give them the land of Canaan.
[4346.26 → 4347.14] I am says,
[4347.28 → 4349.48] I have remembered my covenant.
[4349.68 → 4354.44] I have remembered my special promise of relationship to them.
[4354.52 → 4354.82] And then,
[4355.60 → 4358.28] in verse 6 through 8,
[4358.54 → 4359.58] there's so many,
[4360.12 → 4362.74] I will bring you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians.
[4362.74 → 4365.00] I will free you from being slaves to them.
[4365.30 → 4367.40] I will redeem you with an outstretched arm
[4367.40 → 4368.48] and with mighty acts of judgment.
[4368.64 → 4370.12] I will take you as my own people.
[4370.26 → 4371.34] I will be your God.
[4371.66 → 4374.40] I will bring you to the land I swore with uplifted hand
[4374.40 → 4375.22] to give to Abraham,
[4375.36 → 4375.68] to Isaac,
[4375.74 → 4376.16] and to Jacob.
[4376.42 → 4379.56] I will give it to you as a possession.
[4381.20 → 4381.96] And now look,
[4382.02 → 4383.14] let's pull it all together,
[4383.24 → 4383.40] okay?
[4383.62 → 4385.88] You take God's immutability,
[4386.40 → 4388.10] his unchanging nature,
[4388.26 → 4390.78] you take God's I am name,
[4390.78 → 4393.98] and then you see that with his sovereign will,
[4394.12 → 4395.16] his sovereign plan,
[4395.40 → 4396.22] his promises,
[4396.76 → 4396.94] right?
[4396.94 → 4400.20] That he is big enough to have a bigger picture
[4400.20 → 4401.96] than you are able to comprehend,
[4402.50 → 4402.72] right?
[4402.74 → 4403.86] And you put that all together,
[4404.00 → 4406.76] that means God's promise of I will
[4406.76 → 4409.16] is exactly the same as God saying,
[4409.16 → 4410.70] it is done.
[4412.36 → 4414.24] When God says I will,
[4414.56 → 4415.58] he does.
[4415.74 → 4417.00] It's a fact of history
[4417.00 → 4418.98] that just hasn't yet been realized in history.
[4419.52 → 4420.94] It hasn't yet been worked out
[4420.94 → 4422.08] in the plan of God,
[4422.18 → 4423.66] but it will happen.
[4423.82 → 4425.00] It is guaranteed.
[4425.00 → 4426.78] And look,
[4427.32 → 4429.70] we actually as Christians
[4429.70 → 4430.94] in the 21st century
[4430.94 → 4432.02] are blessed in this.
[4432.14 → 4434.02] We are three and a half millennia
[4434.02 → 4435.72] removed from this story,
[4435.72 → 4438.16] and we can actually see it as true.
[4439.78 → 4439.88] Right?
[4439.90 → 4441.54] And if you know this story,
[4442.04 → 4444.66] or if this is new for you,
[4444.80 → 4445.26] get ready,
[4445.38 → 4447.54] because God does take his people
[4447.54 → 4448.24] out of Egypt.
[4448.74 → 4450.34] They do come into the land
[4450.34 → 4451.88] and they are able to worship him.
[4452.22 → 4452.42] Now,
[4452.76 → 4454.16] anxiety still makes them stupid,
[4455.00 → 4457.04] but they're just in good company.
[4458.42 → 4460.22] But it's even deeper than that.
[4461.14 → 4463.22] The picture becomes even more beautiful,
[4463.22 → 4465.68] because this little story
[4465.68 → 4467.10] is a microcosm
[4467.10 → 4469.04] of the whole of humanity's story,
[4469.20 → 4471.88] because this story gets us to Jesus.
[4472.36 → 4474.54] Jesus comes to set you free
[4474.54 → 4476.86] from slavery to sin and death.
[4476.86 → 4479.08] Jesus comes to set us free
[4479.08 → 4480.94] from this present darkness.
[4481.18 → 4483.06] Jesus comes into this world
[4483.06 → 4486.40] as the new and the true and better Moses
[4486.40 → 4488.68] to redeem his people,
[4488.80 → 4491.68] to carry them into the presence of the Father.
[4491.68 → 4493.80] Jesus comes and lives the life
[4493.80 → 4494.58] we should have lived,
[4494.66 → 4497.70] but daily prove that we just cannot do,
[4497.78 → 4499.56] because anxiety makes us stupid.
[4499.90 → 4502.06] Jesus comes and died the death
[4502.06 → 4503.36] that we deserve,
[4504.04 → 4505.84] because we've given into fear
[4505.84 → 4507.48] and worry and darkness.
[4507.48 → 4512.68] in this great story,
[4513.68 → 4516.14] on the cross,
[4516.94 → 4519.38] God takes
[4519.38 → 4523.04] the greatest evil
[4523.04 → 4525.90] that the world had ever intended,
[4526.90 → 4531.02] and he turns it into the greatest possible good
[4531.02 → 4532.20] with the empty tomb.
[4532.70 → 4534.72] The death of God becomes the means
[4534.72 → 4538.06] by which his people are saved from death.
[4538.66 → 4541.36] And if he can do that with sin and death,
[4541.84 → 4543.96] surely, surely he can handle
[4543.96 → 4545.98] your anxious circumstances.
[4546.48 → 4547.42] Surely he can handle
[4547.42 → 4549.18] whatever is giving you fear
[4549.18 → 4551.96] or worry or concern right now.
[4557.62 → 4559.10] And even that's not it.
[4559.10 → 4562.66] Because you see,
[4563.14 → 4566.98] that story's not yet done.
[4568.42 → 4570.18] Because this same Jesus
[4570.18 → 4571.76] who lived and died
[4571.76 → 4574.00] and was ascended to the right hand
[4574.00 → 4575.34] of God the Father Almighty
[4575.34 → 4577.94] will come back.
[4578.74 → 4579.94] He will come back
[4579.94 → 4582.20] with the blast of the archangel's trumpet.
[4582.28 → 4583.04] He will come back
[4583.04 → 4584.64] marching with the armies of God
[4584.64 → 4586.46] that have gone on before him.
[4586.52 → 4587.20] He will come back
[4587.20 → 4588.92] to renew this world,
[4589.08 → 4591.18] to usher in the new creation,
[4591.54 → 4593.08] to refine and redeem
[4593.08 → 4594.20] all that is.
[4594.40 → 4595.40] He will come back
[4595.40 → 4596.76] and the dwelling place of God
[4596.76 → 4598.00] will now be with man
[4598.00 → 4599.20] and we will live with him
[4599.20 → 4601.68] as face to face.
[4602.84 → 4605.46] The story isn't done.
[4605.46 → 4609.68] But it is done.
[4609.68 → 4612.04] In that it is a fact.
[4613.66 → 4616.06] Because of God's immutable nature,
[4616.72 → 4618.00] you can be guaranteed
[4618.00 → 4619.78] that the new creation
[4619.78 → 4621.82] will come.
[4623.10 → 4624.98] And so whatever it is
[4624.98 → 4626.38] you are facing,
[4626.60 → 4629.86] see the truth of God's covenant name,
[4629.96 → 4631.66] the truth of who God is
[4631.66 → 4632.58] as I am,
[4632.58 → 4634.60] and see that in relationship
[4634.60 → 4636.78] to God's covenant promises.
[4639.06 → 4639.98] But no,
[4640.68 → 4642.62] there is also
[4642.62 → 4645.60] a practical warning here.
[4646.74 → 4648.56] Or a practical concern
[4648.56 → 4649.68] yet to note.
[4651.46 → 4652.74] Moses reports
[4652.74 → 4653.88] what God says
[4653.88 → 4654.82] to the Israelites,
[4654.82 → 4657.66] but they did not
[4657.66 → 4658.60] listen to him
[4658.60 → 4660.14] because of their
[4660.14 → 4660.98] discouragement
[4660.98 → 4662.94] and harsh labour.
[4666.52 → 4669.08] As disciples of Jesus,
[4669.08 → 4670.82] we have this
[4670.82 → 4673.08] gospel message.
[4673.42 → 4674.48] As disciples of Jesus,
[4674.68 → 4675.34] we have this
[4675.34 → 4676.16] responsibility
[4676.16 → 4677.04] to proclaim
[4677.04 → 4679.22] the truth of who God is
[4679.22 → 4680.66] and what he has done
[4680.66 → 4683.18] and what he will yet do.
[4683.18 → 4687.32] we have
[4687.32 → 4689.34] the deep
[4689.34 → 4690.26] blessing
[4690.26 → 4692.04] to preach
[4692.04 → 4692.92] peace
[4692.92 → 4695.50] to an anxious people
[4695.50 → 4698.58] and yet
[4698.58 → 4699.48] they may not hear.
[4700.46 → 4701.64] They may not be able
[4701.64 → 4701.98] to hear.
[4702.28 → 4703.58] You may not
[4703.58 → 4704.06] hear.
[4705.14 → 4705.66] You may not
[4705.66 → 4706.36] be able to hear.
[4707.96 → 4708.78] And so,
[4709.72 → 4710.12] leaders,
[4710.12 → 4712.76] don't be like Moses,
[4713.56 → 4714.46] but be like Moses.
[4714.72 → 4715.14] And finally,
[4715.34 → 4716.52] don't be like Moses
[4716.52 → 4717.08] who says,
[4717.76 → 4718.34] if the Israelites
[4718.34 → 4719.32] will not listen to me,
[4719.86 → 4720.60] why should Pharaoh
[4720.60 → 4721.32] listen to me
[4721.32 → 4722.44] since I speak
[4722.44 → 4724.06] with faltering lips?
[4725.18 → 4726.42] The danger is
[4726.42 → 4727.58] we all
[4727.58 → 4728.48] fall back
[4728.48 → 4729.48] on what
[4729.48 → 4730.26] is
[4730.26 → 4731.08] normal.
[4732.08 → 4732.90] And as
[4732.90 → 4733.12] uncomfortable
[4733.64 → 4734.72] as anxiety
[4734.72 → 4735.54] is,
[4736.40 → 4737.64] for some of you,
[4738.28 → 4739.28] for most of you
[4739.28 → 4740.06] perhaps even,
[4741.06 → 4741.84] it is your
[4741.84 → 4743.44] most common
[4743.44 → 4744.50] bedfellow.
[4745.66 → 4747.02] It is the darkness
[4747.02 → 4747.74] that you know
[4747.74 → 4749.00] and that are
[4749.00 → 4749.76] comfortable in
[4749.76 → 4751.16] and are unsure
[4751.16 → 4752.10] how life could
[4752.10 → 4753.18] possibly live
[4753.18 → 4754.52] without this
[4754.52 → 4755.50] anxiety
[4755.50 → 4756.42] piercing
[4756.42 → 4757.82] every aspect
[4757.82 → 4758.52] of what
[4758.52 → 4759.64] you do.
[4760.74 → 4761.42] Remember
[4761.42 → 4762.70] God's
[4762.70 → 4763.44] covenant
[4763.44 → 4764.60] identity
[4764.60 → 4765.78] and his covenant
[4765.78 → 4766.50] promises.
[4766.84 → 4767.40] Remember that
[4767.40 → 4768.30] they are a source
[4768.30 → 4769.20] of strength
[4769.20 → 4770.38] and encouragement.
[4773.18 → 4773.70] Instead,
[4774.86 → 4776.80] instead of
[4776.80 → 4777.78] letting anxiety
[4777.78 → 4778.80] make you stupid,
[4779.80 → 4780.90] let us fix
[4780.90 → 4781.56] our eyes
[4781.56 → 4782.70] on Jesus,
[4783.18 → 4784.38] the one
[4784.38 → 4784.96] whom Moses
[4784.96 → 4785.92] is ultimately
[4785.92 → 4786.40] revealing
[4786.40 → 4787.48] to us.
[4787.86 → 4788.66] Let us fix
[4788.66 → 4789.22] our eyes
[4789.22 → 4789.84] on Jesus,
[4790.06 → 4790.54] the author
[4790.54 → 4791.66] and perfecter
[4791.66 → 4792.50] of our faith,
[4792.60 → 4793.44] and let us run
[4793.44 → 4794.38] with endurance
[4794.38 → 4794.98] the race
[4794.98 → 4795.52] that God
[4795.52 → 4796.26] has set out
[4796.26 → 4797.36] before us.
[4797.84 → 4798.66] In the world
[4798.66 → 4799.14] today,
[4799.30 → 4799.76] anxiety
[4799.76 → 4801.08] and worry
[4801.08 → 4802.24] are very,
[4802.36 → 4803.42] very real.
[4805.56 → 4806.20] But,
[4806.88 → 4808.02] God is more
[4808.02 → 4808.32] real.
[4809.76 → 4810.70] God is more.
[4812.76 → 4813.26] And his
[4813.26 → 4814.86] covenant
[4814.86 → 4815.72] name,
[4816.26 → 4817.28] his identity,
[4817.28 → 4818.82] and his promise
[4818.82 → 4819.98] prove
[4819.98 → 4821.08] that
[4821.08 → 4822.28] true.
[4823.44 → 4824.18] Let me pray
[4824.18 → 4824.48] for you.
[4827.20 → 4827.98] Holy God,
[4828.88 → 4830.94] may we see
[4830.94 → 4832.20] who you are
[4832.20 → 4833.26] more clearly
[4833.26 → 4834.14] today.
[4835.06 → 4835.42] Open
[4835.42 → 4836.50] the eyes
[4836.50 → 4837.36] of our heart
[4837.36 → 4838.18] to see
[4838.18 → 4838.98] you.
[4840.20 → 4841.14] Open the eyes
[4841.14 → 4841.66] of our heart
[4841.66 → 4842.58] to hear
[4842.58 → 4843.16] your word
[4843.16 → 4843.70] and to know
[4843.70 → 4844.24] the truth
[4844.24 → 4844.72] of what
[4844.72 → 4845.54] your name
[4845.54 → 4846.38] means for
[4846.38 → 4847.04] who you are.
[4847.28 → 4847.72] the truth
[4847.72 → 4848.42] of your covenant
[4848.42 → 4848.98] promises
[4848.98 → 4850.08] in relationship
[4850.08 → 4851.06] to the assurance
[4851.06 → 4851.96] that your name
[4851.96 → 4852.76] provides,
[4852.86 → 4853.32] and that we
[4853.32 → 4853.82] might go
[4853.82 → 4854.52] from this
[4854.52 → 4855.32] place,
[4855.44 → 4856.54] having witnessed
[4856.54 → 4857.54] the gospel
[4857.54 → 4859.00] of Jesus Christ
[4859.00 → 4860.10] once again,
[4860.56 → 4861.44] may we go
[4861.44 → 4862.38] convicted
[4862.38 → 4864.10] and encouraged.
[4864.30 → 4864.88] May we go
[4864.88 → 4865.72] strengthened
[4865.72 → 4867.16] and emboldened.
[4867.52 → 4868.30] May we go
[4868.30 → 4872.32] just a little
[4872.32 → 4873.46] bit more
[4873.46 → 4873.98] aware
[4873.98 → 4875.58] of how
[4875.58 → 4876.02] you
[4876.02 → 4877.34] are at work
[4877.34 → 4878.04] in the world
[4878.04 → 4878.72] here and
[4878.72 → 4879.06] now
[4879.06 → 4879.46] and how
[4879.46 → 4879.84] you
[4879.84 → 4880.76] are guiding
[4880.76 → 4881.56] history
[4881.56 → 4882.34] towards
[4882.34 → 4882.74] your
[4882.74 → 4883.44] great
[4883.44 → 4884.14] end.
[4884.28 → 4884.88] And so
[4884.88 → 4885.72] may we
[4885.72 → 4886.22] go
[4886.22 → 4887.08] in
[4887.08 → 4888.00] your
[4888.00 → 4889.10] peace.
[4891.60 → 4892.86] Your peace
[4892.86 → 4894.38] is worth
[4894.38 → 4894.84] the weight
[4894.84 → 4896.48] and you,
[4896.64 → 4897.10] Lord God,
[4897.46 → 4897.98] are the
[4897.98 → 4898.50] weightiest
[4898.50 → 4899.36] of all.
[4899.86 → 4900.36] And so we
[4900.36 → 4901.02] give you
[4901.02 → 4902.06] glory.
[4902.70 → 4903.20] In Jesus
[4903.20 → 4904.14] we pray.
[4905.02 → 4905.42] Amen.
[4905.42 → 4905.50] Amen.
[4915.10 → 4916.20] And we
[4916.20 → 4916.90] rise and
[4916.90 → 4917.54] sing.
[4917.54 → 4933.06] strategies
[4933.06 → 4933.98] in
[4933.98 → 4942.80] Theropod apparent.
[4950.80 → 4956.12] My God of Abraham lead me by your hand.
[4956.12 → 4958.92] You are strong and wise.
[4958.92 → 4967.40] I want to trust in you and in all I do bring you honour and praise.
[4968.92 → 4977.40] How I love you, great and mighty King.
[4977.40 → 4987.40] You are faithful through the ages you never change.
[4988.92 → 4996.40] I know the dark of night that I fear to fight you are hope and truth.
[4997.40 → 5005.18] I want to trust in you and in all I do bring you honour and praise.
[5005.18 → 5013.50] How I love you, great and mighty King.
[5013.50 → 5023.92] You are faithful through the ages you never change.
[5023.92 → 5027.80] Be my guide for the road ahead.
[5028.08 → 5032.20] Should I feel this that you are just and good.
[5033.00 → 5040.40] I want to trust in you and in all I do bring you honour and praise.
[5040.40 → 5049.40] How I love you, great and mighty King.
[5049.40 → 5058.30] You are faithful through the ages you never change.
[5058.30 → 5066.22] How I love you, great and mighty King.
[5066.22 → 5077.04] You are faithful through the ages you never change.
[5077.04 → 5097.44] As you go into this week, know that God himself goes with you in the power of his name and the surety of his promise.
[5097.44 → 5105.92] May God go before you to lead you.
[5105.92 → 5108.78] May God go behind you to protect you.
[5109.28 → 5111.76] May God go beneath you to support you.
[5112.36 → 5114.84] May God go beside you to befriend you.
[5115.30 → 5117.48] Do not be afraid.
[5118.04 → 5119.86] Let the blessing of God come upon you today.
[5119.86 → 5126.86] May God go beside you to love and serve the Lord.
[5126.86 → 5128.86] Amen.
[5128.86 → 5158.84] May God go beside you.
[5158.86 → 5188.84] May God go beside you.
[5188.86 → 5190.86] May God go there, でしょう new hands.
[5190.86 → 5194.24] May God go beside you.
[5194.30 → 5196.16] May God go above and serve the Lord.
[5196.16 → 5197.40] May God go beside you.
[5197.40 → 5198.86] May God overcome you to tell you that.
[5199.20 → 5203.20] May God go inside you, God overcome you.
[5203.56 → 5208.26] May God go ships through our hands.
[5208.26 → 5220.48] There's a shield in our head and a sword at our side
[5220.48 → 5224.36] There's a fire in our spirits that cannot be denied
[5224.36 → 5228.54] There's a father that's a world that's for these you have died
[5228.54 → 5232.04] For the nations who gather before you
[5232.04 → 5235.54] And the years of all can't meet you here
[5235.54 → 5239.14] On the lam who was crucified
[5239.14 → 5248.42] He descended to hell and was raised up to reign at his Father's side
[5248.42 → 5250.78] And the angels will cry
[5250.78 → 5254.30] Hail the Lamb
[5254.30 → 5262.38] Who was slain for the world's ruling power
[5262.38 → 5266.98] And the earth will reply
[5266.98 → 5271.98] You shall reign
[5271.98 → 5277.12] As the King of all kings and the Lord of all worlds
[5277.12 → 5279.30] And the angels will cry
[5279.30 → 5283.26] Hail the Lamb
[5283.26 → 5292.86] Who was slain for the world's ruling power
[5292.86 → 5295.74] And the earth will reply

[5300.86 → 5305.96] As the King of all kings and the Lord of all worlds
[5305.96 → 5311.56] As the King of all kings and the Lord of all worlds

[5327.34 → 5328.16] Fremont
