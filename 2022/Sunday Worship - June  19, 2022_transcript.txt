[0.00 --> 6.94]  You'll have every failure, God. You'll have every victory.
[11.18 --> 17.52]  You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing.
[18.18 --> 23.96]  You say I am strong when I think I am weak.
[23.96 --> 30.56]  You say I am held when I am falling short.
[31.30 --> 37.22]  When I don't belong, oh, you say I'm yours.
[38.28 --> 46.98]  And I believe, oh, I believe what you say of me.
[46.98 --> 53.32]  I believe, oh, I believe.

[164.12 --> 169.12]  And I will open up my heart and let the healer set me free.
[169.12 --> 179.12]  I'm happy to be in the truth and I will daily lift my hands for I will always sing of when your love came down.

[225.12 --> 228.12]  Billy, it's foolishness I know, yeah.
[228.12 --> 231.12]  Yeah, it's foolishness I know.
[231.12 --> 234.12]  It's foolishness I know.
[234.12 --> 243.12]  But when the world is singing like, they will dance with joy like we're dancing now.
[243.12 --> 269.28]  I can sing up your love forever
[269.28 --> 272.12]  I will sing of your love
[272.12 --> 278.18]  I will sing of your love

[324.98 --> 331.92]  I can sing of your love forever.
[354.98 --> 384.96]  I can sing of your love forever.
[384.98 --> 414.96]  I can sing of your love forever.

[510.96 --> 520.30]  Good morning. How are you? I'm great. How are you? I'm doing very well.
[523.54 --> 531.96]  Good morning. How are we all doing? Sounds like there's a lot of excitement in the room this
[531.96 --> 539.80]  morning. We are so glad to have you here with us and to join together to worship our God. If
[539.80 --> 544.62]  you're visiting with us this morning, my name is Chris. I'm one of the pastors here,
[545.40 --> 551.98]  and I, along with a few others, will be leading in worship this morning. This is a special service
[551.98 --> 558.94]  in the life of our church as we are celebrating the grade four graduation out of children's worship
[558.94 --> 575.46]  time and three professions of faith. Three. All right. Oh, see, you got some applause. Nice work.
[577.04 --> 582.50]  So we are excited to celebrate, and we are grateful to God for his faithfulness to us as church
[582.50 --> 589.86]  and to our members here that we can see that happening together. If you are visiting with us
[589.86 --> 594.88]  and you'd like to connect, there are these connect cards that are available. They're on the desk in
[594.88 --> 600.60]  the foyer back there, or there's a digital version. You can scan with your phone, the QR code, and fill
[600.60 --> 605.92]  that out, and that gives us a chance to connect with you, maybe to meet for prayer or to answer
[605.92 --> 610.84]  some questions you have, and we would love to do that. Before we begin, there are just a couple
[610.84 --> 618.82]  announcements we want to make. First of all, youth, you need to, or you are encouraged to sign up for
[618.82 --> 625.16]  youth camp and for reactivate, and links for all of that are in your email inbox, and so you can
[625.16 --> 629.70]  follow up with that. If you have any questions, you can grab Pastor Kevin, and he will address them for
[629.70 --> 639.56]  you. Also, next week Sunday, after our worship together, if you are a member of our church over a
[639.56 --> 646.86]  meeting, we are having an annual general meeting to approve the 2021 financials and the slate for
[646.86 --> 651.98]  office bearers. So we're going to do that after service together, so please stick around following
[651.98 --> 660.06]  that. The details about that are in your e-bulletins as well. And finally, I just want to say thank you
[660.06 --> 664.82]  once again to everyone who came out to the leaders and volunteer lunch that we had yesterday.
[664.82 --> 671.44]  There was 40 or so of us representing only a fraction of the people who are really active and
[671.44 --> 676.58]  who make this church happen, but we had a great day together, and it was a lot of fun. And so I'm
[676.58 --> 682.16]  grateful for all of you and for your willingness to come out and to be silly together and play games
[682.16 --> 688.22]  and be encouraged in our shared ministry. I hope and pray that you were also encouraged.
[688.22 --> 694.00]  We're going to worship God this morning in song and in prayer and in word, and so I'm going to invite
[694.00 --> 700.00]  you, as you're able, to stand. We can be called into worship and greeted by our God this morning.
[704.68 --> 714.18]  And so receive the greeting of our good God. Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God,
[714.18 --> 720.48]  our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ through the presence and power of his Holy Spirit. Amen.
[725.80 --> 729.78]  Of Psalm 103, call us into worship this morning where it says,
[730.18 --> 734.90]  Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name.
[735.38 --> 738.54]  Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits,
[738.54 --> 744.26]  who forgives all your iniquity, who heals all your diseases, who redeems your life from the pit,
[744.60 --> 749.22]  who crowns you with steadfast love and mercy. Let's sing those words now.
[749.22 --> 769.94]  Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless the Lord, O my soul,
[769.94 --> 777.60]  bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless the Lord, O my soul,
[777.60 --> 787.48]  worship his holy name. Sing like never before,
[787.48 --> 796.32]  O my soul, I'll worship your holy name.
[796.32 --> 815.00]  The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning, it's time to sing your song again.
[815.00 --> 823.48]  Whatever may pass, whatever may pass, and whatever lies before me,
[823.48 --> 831.88]  let me be singing when the evening comes.
[834.88 --> 842.08]  Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul,
[842.08 --> 847.08]  Worship his holy name.
[847.08 --> 847.76]  Worship his holy name.
[847.76 --> 851.96]  Sing like never before,
[851.96 --> 860.76]  O my soul, I'll worship your holy name.
[860.76 --> 861.76]  Your holy name.
[861.76 --> 866.64]  Your holy name.
[866.64 --> 867.64]  Your holy name.
[867.64 --> 868.64]  Your holy name.
[868.64 --> 874.64]  Your holy name is great and your heart is mine.
[874.64 --> 881.64]  For all your goodness I will keep on singing.
[881.64 --> 894.52]  Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find.
[894.52 --> 899.52]  God bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul,
[899.52 --> 904.52]  Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul,
[904.52 --> 909.52]  Worship his holy name.
[909.52 --> 910.52]  Your holy name.
[910.52 --> 916.52]  Sing like never before, O my soul,
[916.52 --> 921.52]  O my soul, I'll worship your holy name.
[921.52 --> 922.52]  Sing like never before, O my soul,
[922.52 --> 929.52]  O my soul, I'll worship your holy name.
[929.52 --> 936.52]  And on that day when my strength is failing,
[936.52 --> 942.52]  The end draws near and my time has come.
[942.52 --> 950.52]  Still my soul will sing your praise on ending.
[950.52 --> 962.52]  Ten thousand years and forevermore.
[962.52 --> 969.52]  Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul,
[969.52 --> 975.52]  Worship his holy name.
[975.52 --> 980.52]  Sing like never before, O my soul,
[980.52 --> 988.52]  O my soul, I'll worship your holy name.
[988.52 --> 996.52]  Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul,
[996.52 --> 1002.52]  Worship his holy name.
[1002.52 --> 1007.52]  Sing like never before, O my soul,
[1007.52 --> 1017.52]  O my soul, I'll worship your holy name.
[1017.52 --> 1024.52]  I'll worship your holy name.
[1024.52 --> 1029.52]  Lord, I'll worship your holy name.
[1029.52 --> 1041.52]  Please join me in prayer.
[1041.52 --> 1045.52]  Father, we come to you broken and needy.
[1045.52 --> 1048.52]  Have mercy on us.
[1048.52 --> 1051.52]  We have failed to be faithful to you again this week.
[1051.52 --> 1053.52]  We have not been loving.
[1053.52 --> 1054.52]  We have not been pure.
[1054.52 --> 1057.52]  We have not been forgiving.
[1057.52 --> 1062.52]  Breathe on us again, Lord, with a life that only you can give.
[1062.52 --> 1066.52]  Help us to be in awe of you, of who you are,
[1066.52 --> 1071.52]  And help us to be grateful for what you do in our lives again and again.
[1071.52 --> 1072.52]  We love you, Lord.
[1072.52 --> 1076.52]  Thank you for your love, your mercy, and your grace.
[1076.52 --> 1077.52]  Amen.
[1077.52 --> 1078.52]  Amen.
[1078.52 --> 1080.52]  Amen.

[1227.90 --> 1234.90]  We have lost the awe of you.
[1234.90 --> 1237.90]  We have lost the awe of you.
[1237.90 --> 1241.90]  We have lost the awe of you.
[1241.90 --> 1245.90]  We have lost the awe of you.
[1245.90 --> 1246.60]  God free.
[1249.90 --> 1250.90]  We have lost the awe of you.
[1250.90 --> 1256.90]  We have lost the awe of you.
[1256.90 --> 1263.98]  To the faith that we once knew

[1365.92 --> 1390.92] �
[1393.92 --> 1397.90]  I was lost, but He brought me.
[1398.32 --> 1401.64]  Who is love for me?
[1402.32 --> 1406.58]  Who is love for me?
[1406.58 --> 1410.86]  Through the sun sets me,
[1411.58 --> 1414.58]  no words free indeed.
[1415.86 --> 1419.48]  I'm a child of God.
[1419.92 --> 1422.86]  Yes, I am.
[1423.92 --> 1428.90]  Free at last He has ransomed me.
[1429.26 --> 1432.32]  His grace was free.
[1433.82 --> 1437.54]  While I was a slave to sin,
[1437.66 --> 1441.22]  Jesus died for me.
[1441.60 --> 1445.32]  Yes, He died for me.
[1446.40 --> 1449.92]  Who the sun sets free,
[1449.92 --> 1454.58]  for it's free in me.
[1454.90 --> 1458.82]  I'm a child of God.
[1458.82 --> 1462.32]  Yes, I am.
[1462.32 --> 1467.62]  In my Father's house,
[1467.62 --> 1471.54]  there's a place for me.
[1471.54 --> 1476.14]  I'm a child of God.
[1476.14 --> 1479.38]  Yes, I am.
[1480.44 --> 1484.96]  I am chosen, not forsaken.
[1484.96 --> 1489.28]  I am who you say I am.
[1489.94 --> 1494.26]  You are for me, not against me.
[1494.86 --> 1498.12]  I am who you say I am.
[1498.12 --> 1506.72]  I am who you say I am.
[1506.72 --> 1511.52]  You are for me, not against me.
[1511.52 --> 1512.52]  I am who you say I am.
[1512.52 --> 1514.52]  I am who you say I am.
[1514.52 --> 1518.52]  Yes, I am who you say I am.
[1518.52 --> 1523.52]  The sun sets free.
[1523.52 --> 1527.96]  Oh, it's free indeed.
[1529.10 --> 1532.90]  I'm a child of God.
[1533.26 --> 1535.76]  Yes, I am.
[1537.50 --> 1545.62]  In my Father's house, there's a place for me.
[1545.62 --> 1549.88]  I'm a child of God.
[1550.30 --> 1552.62]  Yes, I am.
[1553.52 --> 1563.04]  In my Father's house, there's a place for me.
[1563.60 --> 1567.56]  I'm a child of God.
[1568.18 --> 1571.66]  Yes, I am.
[1571.66 --> 1575.70]  I'm a child of God.
[1575.70 --> 1577.70]  Yes, I am.
[1577.70 --> 1579.74]  I'm a child of God.
[1579.74 --> 1605.38]  Good morning.
[1605.38 --> 1606.38]  Good morning.
[1606.38 --> 1609.02]  My name is Emo, and I'm a deacon at Emanuel.
[1610.14 --> 1613.84]  We continue our worship this morning with the giving of our gifts.
[1613.84 --> 1619.84]  First of all, for the budget, which covers the administration and ministries of the church.
[1620.88 --> 1624.34]  And the special offering is Open Door Canada.
[1624.34 --> 1632.62]  For more than 65 years, Open Door Canada has worked in the world's most oppressive and restrictive countries,
[1633.30 --> 1642.66]  strengthening Christians to stand strong in the face of persecution and equipping them to shine Christ's light in these places.
[1642.66 --> 1652.58]  When Christians are strengthened in the Lord, they begin to demonstrate God's forgiveness and reach out in love even to their oppressors.
[1652.58 --> 1662.08]  One of the greatest challenges to Christians living under oppression is isolation from God's word and from the body of Christ.
[1662.08 --> 1665.90]  In 1 Corinthians 12, verse 26, it says,
[1666.42 --> 1669.14]  If one member suffers, all suffer together.
[1669.88 --> 1673.14]  If one member is honored, all rejoice together.
[1674.10 --> 1680.50]  Open Door Canada empowers persecuted Christians by supplying Bibles and Christian literature,

[2465.76 --> 2466.12]  up in a
[2466.12 --> 2466.80]  Christian home
[2466.80 --> 2467.14]  and have
[2467.14 --> 2467.46]  gone to
[2467.46 --> 2467.76]  church
[2467.76 --> 2468.44]  however
[2468.44 --> 2468.92]  I never
[2468.92 --> 2469.42]  really
[2469.42 --> 2470.34]  understood
[2470.34 --> 2470.64]  what it
[2470.64 --> 2470.94]  meant to
[2470.94 --> 2471.24]  believe
[2471.24 --> 2471.92]  I just
[2471.92 --> 2472.30]  prayed
[2472.30 --> 2473.42]  before bed
[2473.42 --> 2473.80]  and prayed
[2473.80 --> 2474.34]  at meals
[2474.34 --> 2474.90]  and went
[2474.90 --> 2475.34]  to church
[2475.34 --> 2476.88]  a couple
[2476.88 --> 2477.38]  years ago
[2477.38 --> 2477.64]  when we
[2477.64 --> 2478.06]  started getting
[2478.06 --> 2478.36]  deeper
[2478.36 --> 2478.90]  into youth
[2478.90 --> 2479.84]  I began
[2479.84 --> 2480.40]  digging deeper
[2480.40 --> 2480.74]  in what it
[2480.74 --> 2481.06]  means to
[2481.06 --> 2481.66]  follow Christ
[2481.66 --> 2483.38]  I've done
[2483.38 --> 2483.68]  a couple
[2483.68 --> 2484.04]  of Bible
[2484.04 --> 2484.34]  studies
[2484.34 --> 2484.70]  over the
[2484.70 --> 2485.18]  past couple
[2485.18 --> 2485.52]  years
[2485.52 --> 2485.90]  and I
[2485.90 --> 2486.48]  learned more
[2486.48 --> 2486.92]  not only
[2486.92 --> 2487.46]  about God
[2487.46 --> 2487.76]  but what
[2487.76 --> 2488.14]  my faith
[2488.14 --> 2488.68]  looks like
[2488.68 --> 2489.56]  I realized
[2489.56 --> 2490.00]  that I do
[2490.00 --> 2490.56]  believe what
[2490.56 --> 2490.84]  I've been
[2490.84 --> 2491.40]  taught growing
[2491.40 --> 2491.90]  up because
[2491.90 --> 2492.44]  everything
[2492.44 --> 2493.16]  that I've
[2493.16 --> 2493.54]  read in my
[2493.54 --> 2494.18]  Bible studies
[2494.18 --> 2494.64]  have made
[2494.64 --> 2495.02]  sense
[2495.02 --> 2496.54]  I've seen
[2496.54 --> 2497.04]  God working
[2497.04 --> 2497.60]  in my life
[2497.60 --> 2498.14]  by the people
[2498.14 --> 2498.46]  he has
[2498.46 --> 2498.86]  blessed me
[2498.86 --> 2499.10]  with
[2499.10 --> 2500.32]  I've grown
[2500.32 --> 2500.82]  so much
[2500.82 --> 2501.26]  not only
[2501.26 --> 2501.84]  as a person
[2501.84 --> 2502.38]  but in my
[2502.38 --> 2502.94]  faith because
[2502.94 --> 2503.34]  of certain
[2503.34 --> 2503.68]  people
[2503.68 --> 2504.58]  specifically
[2504.58 --> 2505.02]  my youth
[2505.02 --> 2505.20]  leader
[2505.20 --> 2505.58]  Samara
[2505.58 --> 2506.48]  if it
[2506.48 --> 2506.66]  weren't
[2506.66 --> 2507.06]  for her
[2507.06 --> 2507.82]  I wouldn't
[2507.82 --> 2508.24]  have delved
[2508.24 --> 2508.70]  as deeply
[2508.70 --> 2509.40]  as I have
[2509.40 --> 2509.96]  into putting
[2509.96 --> 2510.92]  time and effort
[2510.92 --> 2511.48]  into gaining
[2511.48 --> 2512.00]  a relationship
[2512.00 --> 2512.56]  with God
[2512.56 --> 2513.42]  and I could
[2513.42 --> 2514.00]  see how God
[2514.00 --> 2514.62]  put her in my
[2514.62 --> 2515.22]  life to help
[2515.22 --> 2515.62]  me go to
[2515.62 --> 2516.16]  Mexico on
[2516.16 --> 2516.54]  the missions
[2516.54 --> 2516.84]  trip
[2516.84 --> 2518.40]  she helped
[2518.40 --> 2518.80]  me get over
[2518.80 --> 2519.32]  my fears
[2519.32 --> 2519.96]  and anxieties
[2519.96 --> 2520.48]  by helping
[2520.48 --> 2520.84]  me learn
[2520.84 --> 2521.20]  to rely
[2521.20 --> 2521.56]  on God
[2521.56 --> 2521.84]  more
[2521.84 --> 2522.22]  and not
[2522.22 --> 2522.74]  on myself
[2522.74 --> 2523.66]  and a
[2523.66 --> 2524.12]  Bible verse
[2524.12 --> 2524.36]  that has
[2524.36 --> 2524.68]  been my
[2524.68 --> 2524.98]  focus
[2524.98 --> 2525.30]  for the
[2525.30 --> 2526.08]  past
[2526.08 --> 2526.44]  several
[2526.44 --> 2526.74]  months
[2526.74 --> 2526.98]  is
[2526.98 --> 2527.38]  Philippians
[2527.38 --> 2527.64]  4
[2527.64 --> 2528.06]  verse 6
[2528.06 --> 2528.50]  to 7
[2528.50 --> 2529.52]  which reads
[2529.52 --> 2530.14]  do not be
[2530.14 --> 2530.66]  anxious about
[2530.66 --> 2531.06]  anything
[2531.06 --> 2531.58]  but in
[2531.58 --> 2532.34]  every situation
[2532.34 --> 2533.00]  by prayer
[2533.00 --> 2533.50]  and petition
[2533.50 --> 2534.50]  with thanksgiving
[2534.50 --> 2535.50]  present your
[2535.50 --> 2536.18]  requests to
[2536.18 --> 2536.48]  God
[2536.48 --> 2537.34]  and the peace
[2537.34 --> 2537.76]  of God
[2537.76 --> 2538.54]  which transcends
[2538.54 --> 2539.36]  all understanding
[2539.36 --> 2539.94]  will guard
[2539.94 --> 2540.28]  your hearts
[2540.28 --> 2540.66]  and minds
[2540.66 --> 2541.06]  in Christ
[2541.06 --> 2541.46]  Jesus
[2541.46 --> 2549.64]  Ruth
[2549.64 --> 2551.22]  you're going
[2551.22 --> 2551.56]  to come
[2551.56 --> 2552.22]  now
[2552.22 --> 2552.66]  and then
[2552.66 --> 2552.98]  Samaria
[2552.98 --> 2553.38]  you'll come
[2553.38 --> 2553.72]  after
[2553.72 --> 2554.18]  because you're
[2554.18 --> 2554.58]  talking for
[2554.58 --> 2554.82]  both
[2554.82 --> 2555.06]  right
[2555.06 --> 2555.66]  yeah
[2555.66 --> 2564.98]  yeah
[2567.34 --> 2576.50]  since I was
[2576.50 --> 2576.74]  little
[2576.74 --> 2577.24]  I've always
[2577.24 --> 2577.66]  known about
[2577.66 --> 2578.08]  God
[2578.08 --> 2578.42]  Jesus
[2578.42 --> 2579.04]  and the Bible
[2579.04 --> 2580.26]  as a family
[2580.26 --> 2580.94]  we did evening
[2580.94 --> 2581.46]  devotions
[2581.46 --> 2582.10]  after dinner
[2582.10 --> 2582.78]  prayed before
[2582.78 --> 2583.14]  bed
[2583.14 --> 2583.84]  and went to
[2583.84 --> 2584.34]  church on
[2584.34 --> 2584.74]  Sundays
[2584.74 --> 2585.80]  I always
[2585.80 --> 2585.82]  I always
[2585.82 --> 2586.12]  listened
[2586.12 --> 2586.66]  in Sunday
[2586.66 --> 2586.98]  school
[2586.98 --> 2587.72]  but the
[2587.72 --> 2588.28]  following week
[2588.28 --> 2588.78]  I could never
[2588.78 --> 2589.38]  remember what
[2589.38 --> 2590.04]  story we read
[2590.04 --> 2591.36]  I did however
[2591.36 --> 2591.98]  remember the
[2591.98 --> 2592.56]  memory verse
[2592.56 --> 2593.08]  for the month
[2593.08 --> 2593.80]  but that was
[2593.80 --> 2594.16]  just to get
[2594.16 --> 2594.86]  the candy prize
[2594.86 --> 2595.50]  after reciting
[2595.50 --> 2595.94]  it to my
[2595.94 --> 2596.24]  teacher
[2596.24 --> 2598.14]  in middle
[2598.14 --> 2598.44]  school
[2598.44 --> 2599.10]  the number
[2599.10 --> 2599.52]  of times
[2599.52 --> 2600.02]  I was called
[2600.02 --> 2600.42]  the good
[2600.42 --> 2600.80]  Christian
[2600.80 --> 2601.12]  innocent
[2601.12 --> 2601.38]  girl
[2601.38 --> 2601.76]  was quite
[2601.76 --> 2602.18]  remarkable
[2602.18 --> 2602.68]  considering
[2602.68 --> 2603.06]  I went
[2603.06 --> 2603.86]  to Langley
[2603.86 --> 2604.18]  Christian
[2604.18 --> 2604.54]  school
[2604.54 --> 2605.76]  I guess
[2605.76 --> 2605.98]  I knew
[2605.98 --> 2606.32]  what to do
[2606.32 --> 2606.86]  as a Christian
[2606.86 --> 2607.82]  read my Bible
[2607.82 --> 2608.22]  pray
[2608.22 --> 2608.82]  be nice
[2608.82 --> 2609.20]  to people
[2609.20 --> 2609.70]  all that
[2609.70 --> 2610.06]  stuff
[2610.06 --> 2613.00]  in grade 7
[2613.00 --> 2613.50]  I was like
[2613.50 --> 2613.72]  yeah
[2613.72 --> 2614.60]  I got this
[2614.60 --> 2615.40]  do my devotions
[2615.40 --> 2616.04]  before bed
[2616.04 --> 2616.62]  that's a cool
[2616.62 --> 2617.14]  thing to do
[2617.14 --> 2617.40]  right
[2617.40 --> 2618.84]  so away I went
[2618.84 --> 2619.80]  doing my devotions
[2619.80 --> 2620.80]  most of the time
[2620.80 --> 2621.42]  falling asleep
[2621.42 --> 2622.06]  while doing it
[2622.06 --> 2622.62]  but at least
[2622.62 --> 2623.06]  I could check
[2623.06 --> 2623.70]  it off the list
[2623.70 --> 2624.44]  so I was good
[2624.44 --> 2625.90]  it probably wasn't
[2625.90 --> 2627.06]  until grade 10
[2627.06 --> 2628.46]  that I got confused
[2628.46 --> 2629.52]  I was doing
[2629.52 --> 2630.12]  all these things
[2630.12 --> 2630.58]  but wasn't
[2630.58 --> 2631.22]  feeling anything
[2631.22 --> 2632.24]  I was questioning
[2632.24 --> 2632.76]  what the point
[2632.76 --> 2633.42]  of all this stuff
[2633.42 --> 2633.78]  was
[2633.78 --> 2634.74]  and why God
[2634.74 --> 2635.28]  wasn't showing
[2635.28 --> 2636.00]  himself to me
[2636.00 --> 2637.92]  there was a lot
[2637.92 --> 2638.28]  of change
[2638.28 --> 2638.86]  happening around
[2638.86 --> 2639.52]  me at the time
[2639.52 --> 2641.78]  a pandemic
[2641.78 --> 2642.82]  had struck the world
[2642.82 --> 2643.44]  and restrictions
[2643.44 --> 2644.08]  weren't staying
[2644.08 --> 2644.44]  the same
[2644.44 --> 2645.28]  for more than a month
[2645.28 --> 2646.44]  there were changes
[2646.44 --> 2647.42]  in my relationships
[2647.42 --> 2648.04]  with friends
[2648.04 --> 2648.68]  and family
[2648.68 --> 2650.26]  but during the time
[2650.26 --> 2650.98]  stuck in my house
[2650.98 --> 2651.62]  with all the new
[2651.62 --> 2652.42]  worries building up
[2652.42 --> 2653.54]  I finally felt God
[2653.54 --> 2654.62]  I learned the reason
[2654.62 --> 2655.32]  why I was doing
[2655.32 --> 2656.06]  my devotions
[2656.06 --> 2657.44]  why I was being nice
[2657.44 --> 2658.40]  to that random person
[2658.40 --> 2659.64]  and why God
[2659.64 --> 2660.18]  is so good
[2660.18 --> 2661.18]  I had time
[2661.18 --> 2662.32]  to reflect on my life
[2662.32 --> 2663.68]  and see how God
[2663.68 --> 2664.10]  was working
[2664.10 --> 2664.62]  in the different
[2664.62 --> 2665.24]  circumstances
[2665.24 --> 2666.02]  I had been through
[2666.02 --> 2667.84]  I saw and still see
[2667.84 --> 2668.54]  him working
[2668.54 --> 2669.28]  through my family
[2669.28 --> 2670.12]  and the ups and downs
[2670.12 --> 2670.88]  we have gone through
[2670.88 --> 2671.92]  with fostering
[2671.92 --> 2672.48]  and adopting
[2672.48 --> 2673.36]  my younger siblings
[2673.36 --> 2674.60]  I felt his love
[2674.60 --> 2675.30]  through my family
[2675.30 --> 2676.46]  I felt his hope
[2676.46 --> 2676.90]  in the midst
[2676.90 --> 2677.48]  of a broken
[2677.48 --> 2678.36]  scrambling world
[2678.36 --> 2679.46]  and most of all
[2679.46 --> 2680.32]  I felt his peace
[2680.32 --> 2681.64]  God had been chasing
[2681.64 --> 2682.84]  after me my whole life
[2682.84 --> 2683.84]  shining his light
[2683.84 --> 2684.42]  for me to see
[2684.42 --> 2687.66]  it wasn't until
[2687.66 --> 2688.66]  I actually had the time
[2688.66 --> 2689.20]  to reflect
[2689.20 --> 2690.20]  and ask questions
[2690.20 --> 2691.08]  for me to see that
[2691.08 --> 2692.24]  all the pieces
[2692.24 --> 2692.88]  fell together
[2692.88 --> 2693.80]  and my love for Jesus
[2693.80 --> 2694.84]  became so strong
[2694.84 --> 2695.56]  and so real
[2695.56 --> 2697.20]  COVID has been known
[2697.20 --> 2698.16]  to be a bad time
[2698.16 --> 2698.90]  in all of our lives
[2698.90 --> 2699.52]  but really
[2699.52 --> 2700.10]  without it
[2700.10 --> 2700.82]  I wouldn't have had
[2700.82 --> 2701.64]  as much time
[2701.64 --> 2702.54]  for God to show up
[2702.54 --> 2703.60]  I wouldn't have
[2703.60 --> 2704.44]  reflected as much
[2704.44 --> 2705.48]  as I got to
[2705.48 --> 2706.94]  during COVID
[2706.94 --> 2707.80]  and now after
[2707.80 --> 2708.90]  I've grown a passion
[2708.90 --> 2709.58]  to learn more
[2709.58 --> 2710.32]  and dig deeper
[2710.32 --> 2710.96]  into the questions
[2710.96 --> 2712.34]  I have
[2712.34 --> 2713.38]  and I am able
[2713.38 --> 2713.86]  to do that
[2713.86 --> 2714.62]  with my youth group
[2714.62 --> 2715.36]  and close friends
[2715.36 --> 2716.60]  I feel like my faith
[2716.60 --> 2717.54]  has always been my own
[2717.54 --> 2718.60]  it just didn't
[2718.60 --> 2719.28]  I just didn't
[2719.28 --> 2720.06]  understand it
[2720.06 --> 2720.82]  and now
[2720.82 --> 2721.76]  through much reflection
[2721.76 --> 2722.54]  challenges
[2722.54 --> 2723.20]  questioning
[2723.20 --> 2723.82]  and growth
[2723.82 --> 2724.44]  I understand
[2724.44 --> 2725.22]  that I won't be able
[2725.22 --> 2726.32]  to fully understand
[2726.32 --> 2727.56]  my indescribable
[2727.56 --> 2729.62]  immutable
[2729.62 --> 2731.34]  mysterious God
[2731.34 --> 2733.02]  but I want to learn more
[2733.02 --> 2734.16]  and lean into the stirring
[2734.16 --> 2734.66]  of my heart
[2734.66 --> 2735.78]  of being in awe of him
[2735.78 --> 2737.30]  because of the love
[2737.30 --> 2738.32]  that I have grown for Jesus
[2738.32 --> 2739.62]  I am professing my faith
[2739.62 --> 2740.66]  today as my own
[2740.66 --> 2751.18]  we're going to invite
[2751.18 --> 2751.84]  Samara up
[2751.84 --> 2752.46]  and she's
[2752.46 --> 2753.66]  going to speak
[2753.66 --> 2754.60]  on behalf
[2754.60 --> 2755.38]  and for both
[2755.38 --> 2763.90]  so I've been
[2763.90 --> 2764.80]  Kaylee's youth leader
[2764.80 --> 2766.06]  now for five years
[2766.06 --> 2766.96]  and I've had the chance
[2766.96 --> 2767.40]  to watch
[2767.40 --> 2768.04]  as she has grown
[2768.04 --> 2768.66]  into the funny
[2768.66 --> 2769.22]  confident
[2769.22 --> 2770.18]  Christ loving woman
[2770.18 --> 2771.18]  that we see before us
[2771.18 --> 2772.24]  and I'm so happy
[2772.24 --> 2772.80]  to be up here
[2772.80 --> 2773.24]  for her
[2773.24 --> 2773.84]  with her
[2773.84 --> 2775.14]  Kaylee
[2775.14 --> 2776.04]  it's been especially
[2776.04 --> 2776.98]  amazing for me
[2776.98 --> 2777.78]  to see you grow
[2777.78 --> 2778.40]  in your faith
[2778.40 --> 2779.16]  throughout these years
[2779.16 --> 2780.14]  I've been blessed
[2780.14 --> 2780.96]  to be able to watch
[2780.96 --> 2781.56]  as you made your
[2781.56 --> 2782.58]  relationship with Christ
[2782.58 --> 2782.94]  your own
[2782.94 --> 2783.76]  through the devotions
[2783.76 --> 2784.18]  you've chosen
[2784.18 --> 2784.86]  to do with me
[2784.86 --> 2786.08]  and through the time
[2786.08 --> 2786.92]  you spend working
[2786.92 --> 2787.76]  on it on your own
[2787.76 --> 2789.12]  you have been so
[2789.12 --> 2790.08]  intentional in growing
[2790.08 --> 2790.76]  your relationship
[2790.76 --> 2791.30]  with Jesus
[2791.30 --> 2792.24]  and because of that
[2792.24 --> 2792.80]  you have been able
[2792.80 --> 2793.54]  to lean on him
[2793.54 --> 2794.08]  when you face
[2794.08 --> 2794.88]  difficult times
[2794.88 --> 2796.66]  Psalm 37
[2796.66 --> 2798.36]  23-24 says
[2798.36 --> 2799.42]  the Lord makes
[2799.42 --> 2800.24]  firm the steps
[2800.24 --> 2800.72]  of the one
[2800.72 --> 2801.62]  who delights in him
[2801.62 --> 2802.72]  though he may stumble
[2802.72 --> 2803.66]  he will not fall
[2803.66 --> 2804.48]  for the Lord
[2804.48 --> 2805.14]  upholds him
[2805.14 --> 2805.80]  with his hand
[2805.80 --> 2807.48]  I pray
[2807.48 --> 2808.54]  that throughout
[2808.54 --> 2809.06]  your life
[2809.06 --> 2809.80]  in the good times
[2809.80 --> 2810.46]  and the challenges
[2810.46 --> 2811.28]  you remember
[2811.28 --> 2812.42]  that even if you stumble
[2812.42 --> 2813.40]  and feel overwhelmed
[2813.40 --> 2814.70]  Jesus is always there
[2814.70 --> 2815.52]  to give you strength
[2815.52 --> 2816.22]  and hold you up
[2816.22 --> 2817.44]  your relationship
[2817.44 --> 2817.94]  with him
[2817.94 --> 2818.90]  like all relationships
[2818.90 --> 2819.84]  will be constantly
[2819.84 --> 2820.74]  changing and growing
[2820.74 --> 2821.68]  and I encourage you
[2821.68 --> 2822.30]  through the highs
[2822.30 --> 2822.68]  and lows
[2822.68 --> 2823.62]  to continue taking
[2823.62 --> 2823.98]  the time
[2823.98 --> 2824.60]  to get to know
[2824.60 --> 2825.10]  Christ better
[2825.10 --> 2826.26]  and find peace
[2826.26 --> 2826.78]  in the knowledge
[2826.78 --> 2828.12]  that he has
[2828.12 --> 2828.64]  the strength
[2828.64 --> 2829.50]  to handle everything
[2829.50 --> 2830.04]  that happens
[2830.04 --> 2830.56]  in your life
[2830.56 --> 2831.42]  even if you feel
[2831.42 --> 2832.04]  like you don't
[2832.04 --> 2836.72]  okay
[2836.72 --> 2839.20]  Ruth
[2839.20 --> 2841.48]  I've had the privilege
[2841.48 --> 2842.38]  of mentoring Ruth
[2842.38 --> 2842.82]  as well
[2842.82 --> 2843.92]  for the past five years
[2843.92 --> 2844.64]  as her youth leader
[2844.64 --> 2845.84]  it's been great
[2845.84 --> 2846.64]  getting to know her
[2846.64 --> 2847.30]  and being able
[2847.30 --> 2848.22]  to see her mature
[2848.22 --> 2849.18]  and become the woman
[2849.18 --> 2850.10]  that God has created
[2850.10 --> 2850.64]  her to be
[2850.64 --> 2852.14]  she's very sweet
[2852.14 --> 2852.70]  and giving
[2852.70 --> 2853.44]  and cares deeply
[2853.44 --> 2854.02]  for the people
[2854.02 --> 2854.52]  around her
[2854.52 --> 2855.62]  and I consider myself
[2855.62 --> 2856.22]  very blessed
[2856.22 --> 2857.30]  to be one of those people
[2857.30 --> 2858.46]  Ruth
[2858.46 --> 2860.16]  I've loved seeing you
[2860.16 --> 2860.92]  take your faith
[2860.92 --> 2861.74]  and make it your own
[2861.74 --> 2862.70]  as an important part
[2862.70 --> 2863.22]  of your life
[2863.22 --> 2864.32]  I have watched
[2864.32 --> 2865.28]  as you put in the effort
[2865.28 --> 2866.02]  to be intentional
[2866.02 --> 2866.70]  with your time
[2866.70 --> 2867.66]  and read through the Bible
[2867.66 --> 2868.80]  deepening your relationship
[2868.80 --> 2869.36]  with God
[2869.36 --> 2871.06]  I'm very honored
[2871.06 --> 2871.70]  to have received
[2871.70 --> 2872.46]  multiple texts
[2872.46 --> 2873.08]  throughout the last
[2873.08 --> 2873.66]  five years
[2873.66 --> 2874.30]  with questions
[2874.30 --> 2875.06]  that have come up
[2875.06 --> 2876.24]  in your personal devotions
[2876.24 --> 2876.82]  and witnessed
[2876.82 --> 2877.58]  how you've learned
[2877.58 --> 2878.44]  and grown through
[2878.44 --> 2880.10]  those devotionals
[2880.10 --> 2881.44]  and ones we've done together
[2881.44 --> 2882.42]  as well as asking
[2882.42 --> 2883.32]  those hard questions
[2883.32 --> 2885.46]  you have worked hard
[2885.46 --> 2886.22]  on making Jesus
[2886.22 --> 2886.84]  the one you put
[2886.84 --> 2887.64]  your identity in
[2887.64 --> 2888.32]  and work hard
[2888.32 --> 2888.98]  on trying to live
[2888.98 --> 2889.80]  a life that reflects
[2889.80 --> 2890.20]  Christ
[2890.20 --> 2892.50]  Galatians 2 verse 20
[2892.50 --> 2892.90]  says
[2892.90 --> 2894.10]  I have been crucified
[2894.10 --> 2894.78]  with Christ
[2894.78 --> 2895.76]  it is no longer
[2895.76 --> 2896.54]  I who live
[2896.54 --> 2897.50]  but Christ who lives
[2897.50 --> 2897.84]  in me
[2897.84 --> 2898.48]  and the life
[2898.48 --> 2899.02]  I now live
[2899.02 --> 2899.58]  in the flesh
[2899.58 --> 2900.90]  I live by faith
[2900.90 --> 2901.68]  in the son of God
[2901.68 --> 2902.40]  who loved me
[2902.40 --> 2903.02]  and gave himself
[2903.02 --> 2903.48]  for me
[2903.48 --> 2904.84]  I pray that you
[2904.84 --> 2905.52]  always remember
[2905.52 --> 2906.30]  how much Jesus
[2906.30 --> 2906.80]  loves you
[2906.80 --> 2907.38]  and what he did
[2907.38 --> 2907.68]  for you
[2907.68 --> 2908.52]  because of that love
[2908.52 --> 2909.60]  I hope that
[2909.60 --> 2910.22]  throughout your life
[2910.22 --> 2910.74]  you continue
[2910.74 --> 2911.60]  to put your identity
[2911.60 --> 2912.04]  in him
[2912.04 --> 2912.66]  and interact
[2912.66 --> 2913.32]  with those around
[2913.32 --> 2913.82]  you in a way
[2913.82 --> 2914.40]  that reflects
[2914.40 --> 2915.02]  the incredible
[2915.02 --> 2915.68]  knowledge that
[2915.68 --> 2916.58]  Christ lives in you
[2916.58 --> 2917.54]  and works through you
[2932.54 --> 2933.64]  all right James
[2933.64 --> 2935.90]  come on up
[2935.90 --> 2936.80]  and then Kevin
[2936.80 --> 2937.52]  as soon as James
[2937.52 --> 2937.78]  is done
[2937.78 --> 2938.42]  you can come up
[2941.60 --> 2953.92]  I have been going
[2953.92 --> 2954.36]  to church
[2954.36 --> 2955.98]  basically my entire life
[2955.98 --> 2957.14]  when I was younger
[2957.14 --> 2958.30]  my faith was there
[2958.30 --> 2959.26]  and I knew it was there
[2959.26 --> 2960.06]  but I never really
[2960.06 --> 2961.42]  questioned what it meant
[2961.42 --> 2963.12]  I would go to Sunday school
[2963.12 --> 2964.02]  and learn new things
[2964.02 --> 2964.58]  from the Bible
[2964.58 --> 2965.96]  but I would believe them
[2965.96 --> 2966.56]  without wondering
[2966.56 --> 2967.52]  why I believed it
[2967.52 --> 2969.26]  now having grown up
[2969.26 --> 2969.88]  and gone through
[2969.88 --> 2971.32]  the church's youth program
[2971.32 --> 2972.38]  I've thought of those
[2972.38 --> 2973.32]  questions and answered
[2973.32 --> 2974.10]  them for myself
[2974.10 --> 2976.52]  I believe the Bible
[2976.52 --> 2977.56]  because of my faith
[2977.56 --> 2978.82]  and I have faith
[2978.82 --> 2979.90]  because I know that God
[2979.90 --> 2981.40]  to be our one true God
[2981.40 --> 2982.90]  who always watches over us
[2982.90 --> 2985.12]  one very specific moment
[2985.12 --> 2985.74]  in my life
[2985.74 --> 2986.72]  where I know that God
[2986.72 --> 2988.20]  was working with me
[2988.20 --> 2989.64]  was when my family
[2989.64 --> 2990.62]  went back to visit
[2990.62 --> 2992.66]  our family in New Brunswick
[2992.66 --> 2994.24]  a few years after we had moved
[2994.24 --> 2996.16]  me and my mom
[2996.16 --> 2997.04]  my sister decided
[2997.04 --> 2999.14]  to go drive by our old house
[2999.14 --> 3000.02]  since we hadn't seen it
[3000.02 --> 3000.66]  in a long time
[3000.66 --> 3002.54]  we drove past it once
[3002.54 --> 3003.42]  we were going to stop
[3003.42 --> 3004.56]  but there was people out front
[3004.56 --> 3005.50]  so I drove by
[3005.50 --> 3006.22]  drove by again
[3006.22 --> 3006.78]  and went home
[3006.78 --> 3008.10]  the next day
[3008.10 --> 3008.82]  on the news
[3008.82 --> 3009.88]  we saw that it had burned
[3009.88 --> 3010.40]  to the ground
[3010.40 --> 3013.54]  so when I saw that
[3013.54 --> 3014.28]  I knew that God
[3014.28 --> 3015.16]  had been gracious
[3015.16 --> 3015.90]  in giving us
[3015.90 --> 3016.68]  one more chance
[3016.68 --> 3017.78]  to see our old home
[3017.78 --> 3019.18]  before it was gone for good
[3019.18 --> 3023.46]  in a time of constant changes
[3023.46 --> 3025.04]  with me finishing high school
[3025.04 --> 3025.62]  and COVID
[3025.62 --> 3027.16]  and everything happening around
[3027.16 --> 3028.70]  with all these decisions to make
[3028.70 --> 3029.78]  there's one thing
[3029.78 --> 3031.00]  that will always be constant
[3031.00 --> 3031.56]  in my life
[3031.56 --> 3032.38]  and that is God
[3032.38 --> 3045.40]  James
[3045.40 --> 3047.56]  it has been an absolute joy
[3047.56 --> 3049.32]  having you part of our youth ministry
[3049.32 --> 3050.78]  these past five years
[3050.78 --> 3052.64]  watching you graduate this week
[3052.64 --> 3054.24]  from Brookswood Secondary School
[3054.24 --> 3055.32]  in some ways felt like
[3055.32 --> 3056.42]  a little bit of a book end
[3056.42 --> 3057.80]  to our relationship
[3057.80 --> 3058.50]  at least this part
[3058.50 --> 3059.26]  of our relationship
[3059.26 --> 3061.12]  as you're finishing high school
[3061.12 --> 3062.32]  and you're professing your faith today
[3062.32 --> 3063.16]  and now you're looking ahead
[3063.16 --> 3064.44]  to Thompson River University
[3064.44 --> 3065.00]  in the fall
[3065.00 --> 3067.66]  and a computer science degree
[3067.66 --> 3068.28]  awaits you
[3068.28 --> 3069.52]  I couldn't be happier
[3069.52 --> 3070.00]  and prouder
[3070.00 --> 3071.06]  of what you have done
[3071.06 --> 3071.72]  and what God
[3071.72 --> 3073.36]  is doing in your life
[3073.36 --> 3074.24]  and where he's taking you
[3074.24 --> 3075.50]  and while this week
[3075.50 --> 3076.30]  maybe some way
[3076.30 --> 3077.10]  feels like a book end
[3077.10 --> 3077.78]  I only mean that
[3077.78 --> 3078.84]  because our relationship
[3078.84 --> 3079.74]  is changing
[3079.74 --> 3080.42]  and not ending
[3080.42 --> 3081.36]  I'm not going to be
[3081.36 --> 3082.86]  teaching you catechism anymore
[3082.86 --> 3083.84]  or Belgic Confession
[3083.84 --> 3085.24]  hopefully we can still chat
[3085.24 --> 3086.04]  about video games
[3086.04 --> 3086.92]  and Marvel movies
[3086.92 --> 3088.36]  and watch a random movie
[3088.36 --> 3088.90]  here and there
[3088.90 --> 3090.72]  maybe even run into each other
[3090.72 --> 3091.72]  at my kids baseball games
[3091.72 --> 3092.46]  every now and then
[3092.46 --> 3093.84]  I hope that that still happens
[3093.84 --> 3094.74]  but something is changing
[3094.74 --> 3096.32]  and as Josh would say
[3096.32 --> 3097.14]  it's awesome
[3097.14 --> 3099.60]  I'm so glad to see
[3099.60 --> 3100.24]  that you are committing
[3100.24 --> 3101.02]  your life to Jesus
[3101.02 --> 3101.94]  and to the church
[3101.94 --> 3103.38]  and I know that this is something
[3103.38 --> 3104.02]  that you have been
[3104.02 --> 3104.98]  taking very seriously
[3104.98 --> 3106.42]  while you're not
[3106.42 --> 3108.10]  the loudest person I know
[3108.10 --> 3109.06]  you've always been willing
[3109.06 --> 3110.28]  to engage conversations
[3110.28 --> 3111.66]  about faith and life
[3111.66 --> 3112.90]  and God and doctrine
[3112.90 --> 3114.28]  over these last five years
[3114.28 --> 3115.58]  in high school
[3115.58 --> 3116.20]  I know that you've had
[3116.20 --> 3117.20]  to stand up for your faith
[3117.20 --> 3117.80]  or at the very least
[3117.80 --> 3119.00]  articulate what you believe
[3119.00 --> 3120.70]  and I always admired that as well
[3120.70 --> 3122.14]  this will only keep happening
[3122.14 --> 3122.96]  of course as you go off
[3122.96 --> 3123.48]  to university
[3123.48 --> 3125.00]  as life changes
[3125.00 --> 3126.36]  lanes now a little bit
[3126.36 --> 3127.32]  for you going forward
[3127.32 --> 3128.42]  I want to encourage you
[3128.42 --> 3129.70]  to remember the Lord
[3129.70 --> 3130.80]  in all these things
[3130.80 --> 3131.88]  remember what Pastor Chris
[3131.88 --> 3133.40]  taught you in pastor's class
[3133.40 --> 3133.74]  recently
[3133.74 --> 3135.04]  remember what you've gleaned
[3135.04 --> 3135.70]  over the years
[3135.70 --> 3137.44]  in HCBC and in 2020
[3137.44 --> 3138.98]  remember the conversations
[3138.98 --> 3139.90]  you've had with different
[3139.90 --> 3140.38]  youth leaders
[3140.38 --> 3141.92]  especially your youth leaders
[3141.92 --> 3142.54]  Matt Woods
[3142.54 --> 3144.04]  and Adrian Molenkamp
[3144.04 --> 3144.78]  almost everything
[3144.78 --> 3145.64]  I mean one of them
[3145.64 --> 3146.82]  did think that cosmetology
[3146.82 --> 3147.76]  meant going to space
[3147.76 --> 3148.50]  so don't remember
[3148.50 --> 3150.40]  everything that they've said
[3150.40 --> 3152.22]  it's probably wise
[3152.22 --> 3152.98]  to forget some stuff
[3152.98 --> 3153.72]  but point is
[3153.72 --> 3155.08]  as you go forward
[3155.08 --> 3156.64]  remember the foundation
[3156.64 --> 3158.52]  of faith that has got you here
[3158.52 --> 3160.12]  keep leaning into it
[3160.12 --> 3161.02]  you're part of this church
[3161.02 --> 3161.94]  you're a full participant
[3161.94 --> 3162.82]  in all its blessings
[3162.82 --> 3163.52]  and responsibilities
[3163.52 --> 3164.86]  now even when you
[3164.86 --> 3165.82]  take off to Kamloops
[3165.82 --> 3166.94]  but no matter what
[3166.94 --> 3167.56]  if you're there
[3167.56 --> 3168.22]  or if you're here
[3168.22 --> 3169.34]  or wherever you find yourself
[3169.34 --> 3170.24]  I want to encourage you
[3170.24 --> 3170.78]  with this blessing
[3170.78 --> 3171.44]  from Paul
[3171.44 --> 3171.92]  in his letter
[3171.92 --> 3172.70]  to the Corinthians
[3172.70 --> 3174.36]  in 1 Corinthians 15
[3174.36 --> 3175.24]  158 Paul says
[3175.24 --> 3175.60]  therefore
[3175.60 --> 3177.42]  James my dear brother
[3177.42 --> 3178.64]  stand firm
[3178.64 --> 3180.42]  let nothing move you
[3180.42 --> 3181.96]  always give yourself
[3181.96 --> 3182.96]  fully to the work
[3182.96 --> 3183.46]  of the Lord
[3183.46 --> 3184.68]  because you know
[3184.68 --> 3185.38]  that your labor
[3185.38 --> 3186.06]  in the Lord
[3186.06 --> 3187.28]  is not in vain
[3187.28 --> 3188.12]  may that be true
[3188.12 --> 3188.98]  for you in your life
[3188.98 --> 3190.46]  as you continue on
[3190.46 --> 3191.66]  what God has in store
[3191.66 --> 3191.96]  for you
[3204.36 --> 3218.62]  Kevin turned it off
[3218.62 --> 3219.42]  I think we got it
[3219.42 --> 3229.06]  so this morning
[3229.06 --> 3230.84]  we are excited
[3230.84 --> 3232.12]  to welcome
[3232.12 --> 3233.88]  these three
[3233.88 --> 3235.54]  into the full
[3235.54 --> 3236.84]  covenant membership
[3236.84 --> 3238.86]  of our church family
[3238.86 --> 3239.84]  here at Langley
[3239.84 --> 3240.92]  at Langley Manual
[3240.92 --> 3242.66]  all the way back
[3242.66 --> 3243.52]  at their baptisms
[3243.52 --> 3244.72]  God extended
[3244.72 --> 3246.10]  a promise to you
[3246.10 --> 3247.76]  and has called you
[3247.76 --> 3249.30]  to be part of us
[3249.30 --> 3250.06]  and today
[3250.06 --> 3251.94]  you take responsibility
[3251.94 --> 3253.54]  for that promise
[3253.54 --> 3255.28]  and we are so grateful
[3255.28 --> 3256.32]  to have walked
[3256.32 --> 3256.88]  that journey
[3256.88 --> 3258.30]  and for the stories
[3258.30 --> 3258.86]  that we could hear
[3258.86 --> 3259.32]  from you
[3259.32 --> 3260.12]  and from the people
[3260.12 --> 3260.68]  who have walked
[3260.68 --> 3261.12]  that journey
[3261.12 --> 3261.70]  with you
[3261.70 --> 3263.30]  I'm going to ask you
[3263.30 --> 3265.00]  each four questions
[3265.00 --> 3266.64]  I'll ask each question
[3266.64 --> 3267.52]  and then ask you
[3267.52 --> 3268.08]  to answer them
[3268.08 --> 3268.68]  individually
[3268.68 --> 3270.66]  once I get through
[3270.66 --> 3271.26]  the questions
[3271.26 --> 3273.32]  and I invite you
[3273.32 --> 3273.88]  to respond
[3273.88 --> 3274.76]  say I do
[3274.76 --> 3275.64]  with God's help
[3275.64 --> 3276.88]  and then following that
[3276.88 --> 3278.14]  we'll ask the church
[3278.14 --> 3279.26]  a question as well
[3279.26 --> 3280.24]  so I'll read all four
[3280.24 --> 3280.66]  questions
[3280.66 --> 3281.40]  and then go through
[3281.40 --> 3284.10]  do you believe
[3284.10 --> 3285.78]  that Jesus Christ
[3285.78 --> 3287.00]  is the son of God
[3287.00 --> 3288.48]  sent to redeem
[3288.48 --> 3288.92]  the world
[3288.92 --> 3290.34]  do you love him
[3290.34 --> 3291.46]  and trust him
[3291.46 --> 3292.04]  as the one
[3292.04 --> 3292.72]  who saves you
[3292.72 --> 3293.38]  from your sin
[3293.38 --> 3294.20]  and do you
[3294.20 --> 3294.90]  with repentance
[3294.90 --> 3295.58]  and joy
[3295.58 --> 3296.52]  embrace him
[3296.52 --> 3297.40]  as the Lord
[3297.40 --> 3298.02]  of your life
[3298.02 --> 3299.30]  two
[3299.30 --> 3300.82]  do you believe
[3300.82 --> 3301.42]  that the Bible
[3301.42 --> 3302.58]  is the word of God
[3302.58 --> 3303.54]  revealing Christ
[3303.54 --> 3304.24]  and his redemption
[3304.24 --> 3305.74]  and that the confessions
[3305.74 --> 3306.76]  of this church
[3306.76 --> 3308.30]  faithfully reflect
[3308.30 --> 3309.20]  this revelation
[3309.20 --> 3311.14]  three
[3311.14 --> 3312.64]  do you accept
[3312.64 --> 3314.28]  the gracious promises
[3314.28 --> 3314.94]  of God
[3314.94 --> 3315.70]  seal to you
[3315.70 --> 3316.40]  in your baptism
[3316.40 --> 3317.06]  and do you
[3317.06 --> 3318.24]  affirm your union
[3318.24 --> 3319.12]  with Christ
[3319.12 --> 3320.38]  and his church
[3320.38 --> 3321.58]  which your baptism
[3321.58 --> 3322.44]  signifies
[3322.44 --> 3323.98]  and four
[3323.98 --> 3326.94]  do you promise
[3326.94 --> 3328.22]  to do all that you can
[3328.22 --> 3328.88]  with the help
[3328.88 --> 3329.80]  of the Holy Spirit
[3329.80 --> 3331.28]  to strengthen your love
[3331.28 --> 3331.86]  and commitment
[3331.86 --> 3332.44]  to Christ
[3332.44 --> 3333.62]  by sharing faithfully
[3333.62 --> 3334.52]  in the life
[3334.52 --> 3335.06]  of the church
[3335.06 --> 3336.26]  honoring and submitting
[3336.26 --> 3337.04]  to its authority
[3337.04 --> 3338.60]  and do you join
[3338.60 --> 3339.82]  with the people of God
[3339.82 --> 3340.76]  in doing the work
[3340.76 --> 3341.62]  of the Lord

[3342.56 --> 3343.64]  James
[3343.64 --> 3344.84]  what is your answer
[3344.84 --> 3346.14]  I do

[3447.16 --> 3448.22]  but also
[3448.22 --> 3449.24]  because you have

[3449.90 --> 3450.48]  the privileges
[3450.48 --> 3451.56]  and responsibilities
[3451.56 --> 3452.54]  of full membership
[3452.54 --> 3453.98]  there is an agenda

[3467.34 --> 3469.08]  alright
[3469.08 --> 3470.44]  we're going to
[3470.44 --> 3471.68]  hop down off stage
[3471.68 --> 3472.44]  or take the stairs
[3472.44 --> 3473.10]  whichever is
[3473.10 --> 3473.74]  safer
[3473.74 --> 3474.72]  and come back
[3474.72 --> 3475.52]  to the middle here
[3475.52 --> 3478.30]  just like we did
[3478.30 --> 3479.42]  with children's worship time
[3479.42 --> 3480.06]  we acknowledge
[3480.06 --> 3481.00]  that there has been
[3481.00 --> 3482.68]  almost countless people
[3482.68 --> 3483.98]  who have spoken
[3483.98 --> 3484.94]  into the lives
[3484.94 --> 3485.70]  of these people
[3485.70 --> 3486.16]  and so
[3486.16 --> 3487.54]  if you are
[3487.54 --> 3488.64]  a family member
[3488.64 --> 3489.92]  a youth group leader
[3489.92 --> 3491.64]  a Sunday school teacher
[3491.64 --> 3492.98]  children's worship time
[3492.98 --> 3493.64]  cadets
[3493.64 --> 3494.34]  or gems
[3494.34 --> 3494.82]  or
[3494.82 --> 3496.04]  if you have been involved
[3496.04 --> 3496.80]  in any way
[3496.80 --> 3498.34]  in the life of faith
[3498.34 --> 3499.56]  in these individuals
[3499.56 --> 3501.04]  I'm going to invite you
[3501.04 --> 3502.06]  to come up to the front
[3502.06 --> 3502.60]  and we're going to
[3502.60 --> 3503.68]  lay hands on them
[3503.68 --> 3505.08]  council members
[3505.08 --> 3505.54]  as well
[3505.54 --> 3506.28]  this is for you
[3506.28 --> 3507.44]  come on up to the front
[3507.44 --> 3508.70]  lay hands on
[3508.70 --> 3509.46]  and we will
[3509.46 --> 3511.58]  pray a prayer of blessing
[3511.58 --> 3512.36]  over you
[3539.46 --> 3545.40]  I think it's a powerful statement
[3545.40 --> 3546.28]  when half the church
[3546.28 --> 3546.76]  gets up
[3546.76 --> 3547.64]  and comes to the front
[3547.64 --> 3549.54]  it shows
[3549.54 --> 3550.62]  how involved
[3550.62 --> 3551.48]  all of us are
[3551.48 --> 3552.08]  in the

[3557.50 --> 3558.26]  let's
[3558.26 --> 3559.02]  pray together
[3559.02 --> 3559.86]  if you are seated
[3559.86 --> 3560.46]  you may also

[3561.30 --> 3562.28]  in offering a blessing
[3562.28 --> 3565.36]  Lord our God
[3565.36 --> 3567.82]  we thank you
[3567.82 --> 3568.96]  for your word

[3738.12 --> 3743.62]  You have fully paid for all my sins and all my debt.
[3744.46 --> 3748.52]  Even when I struggle to believe,
[3750.58 --> 3754.90]  with your precious blood you set me free.
[3757.02 --> 3761.46]  I am not my own,
[3761.46 --> 3767.46]  but belong, body and soul,
[3768.22 --> 3773.82]  in my life and in death.
[3774.36 --> 3780.28]  To you, Lord, Christ my Lord.
[3781.96 --> 3787.28]  You preserve my life in such a way that without you.
[3787.28 --> 3793.54]  Not a hair can fall for me unless you live in two.
[3794.54 --> 3799.20]  Even when I'm lost in desperation,
[3800.46 --> 3805.42]  all things work together for my salvation.
[3805.42 --> 3810.42]  I am not my own,
[3810.42 --> 3816.42]  but belong, body and soul,
[3816.42 --> 3822.42]  in my life and in death.
[3822.42 --> 3829.42]  To you, Lord, Christ my Lord.
[3829.42 --> 3831.42]  Always by your Holy Spirit,
[3831.42 --> 3832.42]  you are your God.
[3832.42 --> 3834.42]  You are your God.
[3834.42 --> 3836.42]  You are your God.
[3836.42 --> 3841.42]  Always by your Holy Spirit,
[3841.42 --> 3846.42]  you assured me,
[3846.42 --> 3853.42]  of eternal life and make me willing and ready.
[3853.42 --> 3858.42]  Even when I can't see my way through,
[3858.42 --> 3862.42]  from now on to always live for you.
[3862.42 --> 3874.42]  I am not my own,
[3874.42 --> 3880.42]  but belong, body and soul,
[3880.42 --> 3885.42]  in my life and in death.
[3885.42 --> 3887.42]  I am not my own,
[3887.42 --> 3892.42]  but belong, body and soul,
[3892.42 --> 3895.42]  in my life and in death.
[3895.42 --> 3899.42]  In my life and in death.
[3899.42 --> 3907.42]  To you, Lord, Christ my Lord.
[3907.42 --> 3911.42]  I am not my own,
[3911.42 --> 3916.42]  but belong, body and soul,
[3916.42 --> 3918.42]  body and soul,
[3918.42 --> 3921.42]  in my life and in death.

[3924.42 --> 3932.42]  To you, Lord, Christ my Lord.
[3932.42 --> 3936.42]  I am not my own,
[3936.42 --> 3939.42]  but belong,
[3939.42 --> 3941.42]  Lord,
[3941.42 --> 3944.42]  body and soul,
[3944.42 --> 3949.42]  in my life and in death.
[3949.42 --> 3958.42]  To you, Lord, Christ my Lord.
[3958.42 --> 3961.42]  I am not my own,
[3961.42 --> 3963.42]  but belong,
[3963.42 --> 3965.42]  in the name of the Lord.
[3965.42 --> 3967.42]  Thank you.
[3967.42 --> 3968.42]  Thank you.
[3968.42 --> 3970.42]  Thank you.
[3970.42 --> 3971.42]  Thank you.
[3971.42 --> 3973.42]  Thank you.
[3973.42 --> 3974.42]  Thank you.
[3974.42 --> 3975.42]  Thank you.
[3975.42 --> 3977.42]  Thank you.
[3982.42 --> 3987.42]  All right, kids, come on up to the front here.
[3987.42 --> 3988.42]  Ooh boy.
[3988.42 --> 3990.42]  Well, I guess I'll take it.
[3990.42 --> 3992.42]  My spot has been taken.
[3992.42 --> 3999.60]  been taken. Come on up. This is our last kids corner for a little while, so now's your chance.
[4001.14 --> 4006.46]  It might be, but you can still come up if you're not that young. So we're just going
[4006.46 --> 4011.32]  to just do the blessing today because it's a very full service, so, and then we'll talk
[4011.32 --> 4015.98]  more about the story in children's worship time. So you guys can just stand on up right
[4015.98 --> 4016.30]  now.
[4019.22 --> 4020.36]  And face that way.
[4022.42 --> 4028.18]  Are you guys ready? So we're going to put our hands up if you haven't done it before,
[4028.28 --> 4029.92]  and we're going to say, the Lord be with you.
[4052.42 --> 4066.40]  Good morning. My name's Sam, and I'm a member here at Emmanuel, and it's my privilege to
[4066.40 --> 4067.54]  lead you in our family prayer.
[4070.12 --> 4076.18]  Our Father in heaven, we acknowledge you are always present. Creator of the universe,
[4076.18 --> 4083.68]  hallowed be your name. It's hard to fathom how awesome you are, because you are the I am,
[4084.06 --> 4091.18]  almighty God, everlasting Father, sustainer of all, giver of life, and healer of the nations.
[4092.24 --> 4096.92]  Yet you listen to your children when they pray and respond in your time.
[4096.92 --> 4103.28]  May your kingdom come as your church seeks to honor you and share the good tidings revealed
[4103.28 --> 4108.52]  through your word. In our worship, we look to lift up your name in praise and adoration,
[4109.36 --> 4115.56]  knowing that we depend on you every moment of our existence. We offer our lives, even though
[4115.56 --> 4121.34]  we are unable to do the smaller things without your help. But know that we can do all things
[4121.34 --> 4128.44]  through Christ who gives us strength. Forgive our sins as we forgive those who have committed
[4128.44 --> 4137.10]  wrongs against us. You are compassionate, slow to anger, and abounding in love. Help us to model
[4137.10 --> 4144.44]  that in our lives. Thank you for the commitments we witnessed today as Kaylee, Jeremy, and Ruth
[4144.44 --> 4151.10]  profess their faith. May this be a turning point in their lives, which will encourage them to depend
[4151.10 --> 4157.62]  on you as they take the next steps in their life. Make big decisions that will impact their lives
[4157.62 --> 4165.70]  moving forward. Ephesians, we note that it is by thy grace that we have been saved through faith,
[4165.86 --> 4173.38]  and this is not of ourselves. It is a gift of God, not by works that no one can boast, for we are God's
[4173.38 --> 4180.76]  handiwork created in Christ Jesus to do the good works which he has prepared in advance for us to do.
[4181.76 --> 4186.66]  We are grateful for the graduates of the Children's Worship Time who have completed their years of
[4186.66 --> 4192.60]  instruction and now join the rest of the congregation each week receiving instruction from your word.
[4193.38 --> 4199.42]  We also celebrate with the grade 12 students that have completed their studies and now look forward to
[4199.42 --> 4208.12]  life challenges in post-secondary studies, mission work, or various trades and jobs. Bless each one as
[4208.12 --> 4215.94]  they seek your will in their lives. We are grateful for the leadership in Emmanuel and we commend those who
[4215.94 --> 4225.92]  have agreed to let their name stand. We pray for Brenda, Jeremy, Rich, Yap, and also for Seth and Dick and John
[4225.92 --> 4232.18]  for the offices of elders and deacons. We pray that you would give each one wisdom and a measure of your
[4232.18 --> 4241.14]  grace to serve your church. Father, today is celebrating Father's Day. We pray that you would bless each one
[4241.14 --> 4250.60]  as they are godly men who serve their families and each other. We also pray for the recent meetings
[4250.60 --> 4258.18]  at Synod. We pray for our denomination as we move forward after some difficult and complicated
[4258.18 --> 4264.82]  decisions that may challenge our unity. Keep us strong and allow your spirit to guide our conversations.
[4266.68 --> 4272.52]  Our prayer is for those who continue to grieve the loss of loved ones. This week the Van Hemerts will
[4272.52 --> 4278.56]  celebrate the life of Pastor John after his faithful journey in ministering in many congregations
[4278.56 --> 4285.26]  meetings, including to many of us who are here today. Give Caroline and Glenn your peace as they with their
[4285.26 --> 4292.30]  family and friends. Lay that to rest on Tuesday. We pray for the Riesbos family as they continue to grieve
[4292.30 --> 4300.48]  the loss of Louise. We pray for Peter, Daryl and Maria, Michael and Suzanne, Sue and Brandon. May they have comfort
[4300.48 --> 4307.02]  and strength as they say farewell to an amazing wife, mother and grandmother and friend.
[4307.86 --> 4314.80]  We have assurance from the words of the song that we just sang. I am not my own, but belong body and soul
[4314.80 --> 4323.28]  in life and in death to you, Lord. Christ my Lord. There are many others that have recently lost loved ones.
[4323.28 --> 4329.98]  We pray for your continued presence and peace that passes all understanding. Our prayer are for others that need your
[4329.98 --> 4337.06]  healing touch. We think this morning of Judy Dykstra who continues to have some issues and covets your healing touch.
[4337.06 --> 4345.26]  We pray for others that may be suffering in silence. May they experience the touch of our great physician who cares for us all.
[4345.26 --> 4353.04]  Lord, lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. We live in a broken world, Lord, which
[4353.04 --> 4362.36]  lures us to many things of this world and keeps us from doing your will. Keep us strong so we can resist the evil one
[4362.36 --> 4369.76]  and look to you for all our wants and needs. We pray this morning that you would anoint Josh as he brings
[4369.76 --> 4380.44]  the words that we need to hear as he shares the words of 1 John 5, how we may be confident in approaching your throne of grace.
[4381.44 --> 4389.42]  Because yours is the power, the glory, forever and ever. In the name of our precious Savior, we pray. Amen.
[4399.76 --> 4424.16]  Hello? Okay. Wonderful.
[4424.16 --> 4434.38]  Wonderful. This never gets any less terrifying. Okay. In the first year of the COVID pandemic,
[4435.04 --> 4441.44]  I learned the value and the power of habits. How they shape us, keep us on track, how they give us
[4441.44 --> 4448.02]  purpose, how they form us and reform us. During that first year of the pandemic, I struggled specifically
[4448.02 --> 4454.14]  to keep praying. I prayed in the beginning for a while. I fought the apathy, but eventually I just
[4454.16 --> 4462.24]  stopped. I got laid off from my job. School was shut down. Church was shut down. I couldn't see anyone
[4462.24 --> 4469.58]  except for my immediate family. I started to not care about anything in life. The days blended together.
[4469.68 --> 4475.42]  There was no reason to wake up in the morning. I was going to bed at 5 a.m., waking up at 2 p.m.
[4476.92 --> 4480.80]  In middle school, this would have sounded amazing. This was my dream. Do whatever I want,
[4480.80 --> 4485.96]  eat whatever I want, and I don't have to leave the comfort of my home. But I didn't realize what
[4485.96 --> 4492.30]  happens to your mind when you have no purpose, no patterns, and no habits. In reality, it wasn't
[4492.30 --> 4496.74]  that I had no habits. It was that I had made a habit of doing nothing, and that proved destructive.
[4499.48 --> 4504.60]  Prayer, as I mentioned, was one of those habits that I stopped practicing. At first, I thought it
[4504.60 --> 4508.36]  wasn't that big of a deal. It was because I had this perception that prayer is a tool,
[4508.36 --> 4513.90]  a spiritual telephone to get things from God, a way to get what I needed from the one who could get me
[4513.90 --> 4520.62]  anything. Don't get me wrong. I would pray for the good times and joy for strength and hard times,
[4520.74 --> 4527.10]  for family members, for friends, new moments of spiritual growth, wisdom, humility, courage.
[4527.76 --> 4534.82]  We should pray for those things. Prayer is there for us to ask God for what we need from him.
[4534.82 --> 4539.58]  Prayer is there for us to cry out to God when we mourn and when we are broken.
[4540.92 --> 4545.18]  But the passage we're going to get to today presents an aspect of prayer that I was missing.
[4546.08 --> 4552.74]  It's a beautiful and elegant feature in this spiritual act that I think has been lost for
[4552.74 --> 4559.50]  me and many others. And this sermon series, Holy Habits, reminds us of this aspect of prayer.
[4559.50 --> 4568.60]  And this is the point that it gets to. Prayer is not just a tool to ask for stuff from God.
[4569.30 --> 4575.64]  It's not just how we cry out to him in our brokenness and in our pain or praise him in our joy.
[4576.76 --> 4582.86]  But it is also a method for the disciple to be unified with the Lord in will and action.
[4582.86 --> 4595.30]  Prayer is transformative. It conforms the prayer into the image of Christ.
[4596.58 --> 4599.64]  And in our passage today, John teaches us this aspect of prayer.
[4600.46 --> 4604.12]  So if you have your Bible, follow along. Or if you have a phone, please use that.
[4604.58 --> 4607.66]  The passage today is 1 John 5, 13-16.
[4608.80 --> 4609.54]  Here it is.
[4609.54 --> 4617.90]  I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life.
[4619.26 --> 4624.06]  This is the confidence we have in approaching God, that if we ask anything according to his will,
[4625.30 --> 4626.42]  he hears us.
[4627.02 --> 4632.44]  And if we know that he hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have what we asked of him.
[4632.44 --> 4640.70]  John opens up explicitly presenting the purpose of this passage.
[4641.36 --> 4643.10]  He says in verse 13-14,
[4643.28 --> 4646.40]  I write this to you who believe in the name of the Son of God,
[4646.76 --> 4649.02]  so that you may know that you have eternal life.
[4649.72 --> 4651.80]  This is the confidence in approaching God.
[4652.72 --> 4654.58]  So right away he addresses his audience.
[4654.58 --> 4664.02]  The purpose of this passage is for you, the congregation of Emmanuel, me, James, Ruth, Kaylee.
[4665.24 --> 4667.12]  Everything in this passage is for us.
[4668.08 --> 4671.92]  If you're a visitor here or have not professed your faith in the name of the Son of God,
[4672.60 --> 4674.18]  we here invite you to do so.
[4674.62 --> 4678.46]  Because this is the hope that you can expect from the confidence in Christ.
[4679.36 --> 4679.72]  Why?
[4679.72 --> 4683.10]  So that you may know that you have eternal life.
[4683.86 --> 4686.20]  This is the confidence in approaching God.
[4687.82 --> 4691.00]  I thought that when I was struggling with prayer during the beginning of the pandemic,
[4691.16 --> 4694.64]  I thought prayer was talking to God and telling him how I feel,
[4695.70 --> 4696.54]  about what I wanted.
[4697.20 --> 4699.10]  But John is telling us something else about prayer.
[4699.92 --> 4701.18]  Prayer is all those things.
[4701.76 --> 4704.64]  But here John is telling us that implicit in every prayer,
[4705.12 --> 4708.70]  there is a reminder of God's gracious promise of eternal life.
[4708.70 --> 4710.38]  that when we pray,
[4710.96 --> 4713.92]  we are confident in the promise of eternal life.
[4714.34 --> 4716.04]  That when we are willing to pray to him,
[4716.58 --> 4717.88]  or cry out to him,
[4718.14 --> 4720.84]  it's because we actually believe that it works.
[4721.96 --> 4724.98]  By praying, we are professing our faith.
[4728.84 --> 4731.62]  Our confidence in God's faithfulness.
[4731.62 --> 4734.66]  Now, I'm a nerd,
[4734.80 --> 4738.98]  so the word for confidence here is a profound choice on John's part,
[4739.32 --> 4742.70]  and it's really enlightening to the nature of the confidence we have here in prayer.
[4743.18 --> 4744.72]  In the Greek, the word is paratia,
[4745.50 --> 4746.88]  which means all outspokenness,
[4747.00 --> 4747.60]  frankness,
[4747.82 --> 4748.40]  bluntness,
[4748.76 --> 4749.76]  a simple assurance,
[4750.24 --> 4750.78]  boldness,
[4750.98 --> 4751.40]  conviction.
[4752.54 --> 4755.38]  John uses this word a few other times in this short passage,
[4755.72 --> 4758.56]  and they will help us to see what is so profound about this.
[4758.56 --> 4761.64]  So in chapter 2, verse 28,
[4762.30 --> 4762.80]  he says,
[4763.26 --> 4764.06]  And now, dear children,
[4764.60 --> 4765.34]  continue in him,
[4765.52 --> 4766.58]  so that when he appears,
[4767.10 --> 4768.78]  we may be bold and unashamed
[4768.78 --> 4770.22]  before him at his coming.
[4771.94 --> 4773.40]  In chapter 3, 21,
[4774.14 --> 4774.50]  he says,
[4774.60 --> 4774.98]  Dear friend,
[4775.04 --> 4776.34]  if our hearts do not condemn us,
[4776.64 --> 4779.02]  we have conviction before God.
[4779.86 --> 4780.56]  And lastly,
[4780.64 --> 4781.56]  in chapter 4, 17,
[4781.56 --> 4784.50]  this is how love is made complete among us,
[4784.50 --> 4786.96]  so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment.
[4787.76 --> 4788.52]  In this world,
[4788.66 --> 4789.42]  we are like Jesus.
[4790.54 --> 4793.48]  The same confidence that allows us to prepare for Jesus,
[4794.18 --> 4797.24]  the same confidence that we have to stand before God on judgment day,
[4797.64 --> 4800.74]  the same confidence we have before the living God,
[4801.38 --> 4804.44]  is the confidence that we can bring before God in prayer.
[4804.44 --> 4809.74]  This confidence in our God is why Paul tells us to never cease praying.
[4810.80 --> 4812.34]  1 Thessalonians 5, 17,
[4813.02 --> 4815.00]  Pray without stopping.
[4815.94 --> 4816.66]  Pray always.
[4816.94 --> 4817.96]  Whenever you can pray,
[4818.46 --> 4818.70]  pray.
[4819.20 --> 4820.20]  Pray open to God.
[4820.74 --> 4822.46]  Let your hearts be exposed to him.
[4822.86 --> 4824.52]  Don't try to hide anything from him.
[4824.86 --> 4825.90]  You can't anyways.
[4827.44 --> 4829.94]  When we can pray with this kind of openness to our God,
[4830.00 --> 4831.66]  it means that we are opening our hearts to him.
[4831.66 --> 4835.88]  Where for so many years we have tried to cover our sins in shame
[4835.88 --> 4839.52]  because we felt we would face the wrath of God for our sin,
[4839.84 --> 4841.76]  we can now open our hearts to our Redeemer
[4841.76 --> 4844.74]  and be confident in the promise of eternal life.
[4845.38 --> 4846.66]  Be persistent in prayer.
[4847.24 --> 4848.22]  Don't hold back.
[4848.68 --> 4849.82]  Never stop.
[4852.86 --> 4854.08]  John goes on to say,
[4855.38 --> 4856.90]  this is the confidence in approaching God,
[4857.48 --> 4861.12]  that if we ask anything according to his will,
[4861.66 --> 4862.70]  he hears us.
[4863.54 --> 4866.00]  When we pray according to the will of God,
[4866.54 --> 4868.28]  we receive what we ask for.
[4869.82 --> 4872.08]  When what we pray is not according to his will,
[4872.64 --> 4875.20]  then we won't receive what we asked for,
[4875.62 --> 4877.82]  but we will receive what his good will is.
[4877.82 --> 4885.40]  Sometimes we think of prayer as a conversation with the divine,
[4885.98 --> 4887.14]  and in many ways it is.
[4887.70 --> 4890.12]  We have talked about the holy habit of listening to Jesus,
[4890.98 --> 4892.14]  yet last Sunday,
[4892.28 --> 4894.42]  and today the holy habit of talking with Jesus.
[4895.46 --> 4896.64]  It's important to note, however,
[4896.68 --> 4898.72]  that the habit is not talking to Jesus,
[4899.00 --> 4901.00]  it's talking with Jesus.
[4901.64 --> 4903.08]  These habits are not a conversation
[4903.08 --> 4905.00]  where we listen through the reading of a word
[4905.00 --> 4907.14]  and then respond in prayer and worship.
[4908.04 --> 4910.04]  Prayer is the conversation.
[4911.12 --> 4912.96]  Prayer isn't a one-sided effort.
[4913.92 --> 4915.42]  It's a collaborative grace
[4915.42 --> 4918.14]  where we speak with our Savior to the Father.
[4919.18 --> 4921.08]  We speak with him according to his will,
[4921.48 --> 4922.82]  and by the power of the Holy Spirit,
[4923.02 --> 4924.34]  those prayers rise.
[4925.50 --> 4926.78]  And when we can't say the words
[4926.78 --> 4929.16]  that our souls can't express with conscious words,
[4929.76 --> 4930.96]  his Spirit speaks for us
[4930.96 --> 4934.24]  knowing that our souls are groaning for our God.
[4936.00 --> 4937.86]  Romans 8, 26 to 28 says,
[4938.36 --> 4939.30]  In the same way,
[4939.88 --> 4941.50]  the Spirit helps us in our weakness.
[4942.38 --> 4944.12]  We do not know what we ought to pray for,
[4944.18 --> 4946.48]  but the Spirit himself intercedes for us
[4946.48 --> 4947.68]  with wordless groans.
[4948.60 --> 4950.26]  And he who searches our hearts
[4950.26 --> 4951.96]  and knows the mind of the Spirit,
[4952.36 --> 4954.32]  because the Spirit intercedes for God's people
[4954.32 --> 4955.84]  in accordance with the will of God,
[4956.60 --> 4957.80]  and we know that in all things
[4957.80 --> 4959.80]  God works for the good of those who love him.
[4959.80 --> 4962.56]  who have been called according to his purpose.
[4963.52 --> 4965.54]  These two passages from Paul and John
[4965.54 --> 4966.80]  blend beautifully together.
[4967.90 --> 4970.38]  Where John says he wrote to believers
[4970.38 --> 4971.32]  so that they were confident
[4971.32 --> 4973.00]  in God's promise of eternal life,
[4974.18 --> 4975.64]  Paul says that all things work
[4975.64 --> 4976.88]  for the good of those who love him,
[4977.16 --> 4978.90]  who have been called according to his purpose.
[4979.78 --> 4982.18]  Where John said that if we ask according to his will,
[4982.68 --> 4983.72]  then he hears us,
[4983.78 --> 4985.10]  and we will receive that of him,
[4985.82 --> 4987.32]  Paul says that when we in our weakness
[4987.32 --> 4988.46]  don't know what to pray,
[4988.46 --> 4990.82]  the Spirit intercedes on our behalf
[4990.82 --> 4993.56]  and prays in accordance with God's will for us.
[4995.10 --> 4997.82]  Whether we pray in accordance with God's will
[4997.82 --> 4999.00]  or we don't,
[5000.70 --> 5003.00]  the faithful and good will of God
[5003.00 --> 5003.92]  is what we get.
[5005.92 --> 5007.02]  Blessed if you do,
[5007.38 --> 5008.40]  blessed if you don't.
[5012.34 --> 5013.90]  Now you're probably thinking to yourselves,
[5014.34 --> 5016.72]  if God's will is what I get either way,
[5016.72 --> 5017.66]  whether I pray or not,
[5018.44 --> 5019.54]  then why pray?
[5021.68 --> 5023.88]  Because John is telling us something.
[5024.46 --> 5025.26]  He's telling us this.
[5026.34 --> 5028.90]  Prayer is not just a tool
[5028.90 --> 5030.40]  to ask stuff from God.
[5031.38 --> 5033.76]  It's not just how we cry out to him
[5033.76 --> 5035.60]  in our brokenness and in our pain
[5035.60 --> 5037.76]  or praise him in our joy.
[5038.58 --> 5040.44]  But it is also the method
[5040.44 --> 5042.14]  for the disciple to be unified
[5042.14 --> 5044.76]  with the Lord in will and action.
[5045.70 --> 5047.76]  Paul tells us to never stop praying
[5047.76 --> 5049.46]  because when we pray over
[5049.46 --> 5051.26]  and over and over again
[5051.26 --> 5051.90]  in repetition,
[5052.26 --> 5053.32]  we form patterns
[5053.32 --> 5055.06]  and in patterns we form habit.
[5055.56 --> 5057.14]  And in doing it again and again,
[5057.54 --> 5059.32]  we are faced with that faithfulness,
[5059.68 --> 5060.50]  with that confidence,
[5061.06 --> 5062.48]  with that promise of good will
[5062.48 --> 5063.46]  and eternal life.
[5064.00 --> 5066.04]  When we pray over and over again,
[5066.24 --> 5067.58]  we come close and make contact
[5067.58 --> 5069.34]  with that incomprehensibly good will
[5069.34 --> 5070.98]  and we start to live in it.
[5071.42 --> 5073.06]  Instead of trying to get what we want,
[5073.30 --> 5074.84]  we start to pray what he wants
[5074.84 --> 5078.52]  and we start to pray for that good will.
[5079.10 --> 5080.98]  We start to pray for that promised land
[5080.98 --> 5083.58]  and we start to be more like Jesus
[5083.58 --> 5085.34]  crying out to his father
[5085.34 --> 5086.32]  the night he was betrayed.
[5087.16 --> 5088.86]  Father, if you are willing,
[5089.54 --> 5090.56]  take this cup from me.
[5091.70 --> 5092.76]  Yet not my will,
[5093.08 --> 5094.02]  but yours be done.
[5095.02 --> 5096.48]  When Jesus cried out to help,
[5096.48 --> 5097.46]  he knew that the help
[5097.46 --> 5098.98]  was not in getting what he wanted,
[5099.34 --> 5101.56]  but rather the help was in God's will.
[5102.58 --> 5104.80]  Our prayers and actions
[5104.80 --> 5106.86]  and our praises
[5106.86 --> 5108.76]  start to sound like this,
[5109.34 --> 5110.80]  like our Lord's prayers.
[5112.00 --> 5113.58]  Jesus poured out his pain
[5113.58 --> 5115.26]  and fear and terror
[5115.26 --> 5116.60]  to his father,
[5116.98 --> 5118.24]  but let all of that go
[5118.24 --> 5120.80]  knowing that his father's will was good
[5120.80 --> 5122.24]  and being confident
[5122.24 --> 5123.58]  in the promise of eternal life
[5123.58 --> 5125.06]  for him and everyone
[5125.06 --> 5126.06]  who would believe in his name
[5126.06 --> 5126.82]  like John wrote.
[5126.82 --> 5129.40]  Jesus is unifying his will
[5129.40 --> 5130.28]  with his father's.
[5133.78 --> 5135.24]  Now all that being said,
[5136.24 --> 5138.84]  what do we today do with this?
[5139.86 --> 5141.02]  How does this affect
[5141.02 --> 5142.10]  our daily worship
[5142.10 --> 5143.10]  and prayers?
[5143.60 --> 5144.60]  How does this affect
[5144.60 --> 5145.76]  how we talk with Jesus?
[5147.66 --> 5148.80]  Or how should this shape
[5148.80 --> 5150.62]  how we live this holy habit?
[5150.62 --> 5153.10]  Now it's important to remember
[5153.10 --> 5153.80]  that the affect
[5153.80 --> 5154.76]  comes through repetition
[5154.76 --> 5156.02]  which forms habit.
[5156.74 --> 5157.82]  And there will be moments
[5157.82 --> 5158.82]  where we fall out of habit
[5158.82 --> 5159.80]  like I did,
[5159.90 --> 5160.90]  but remember the spirit
[5160.90 --> 5161.62]  prays for you
[5161.62 --> 5163.00]  even when you don't.
[5165.20 --> 5165.52]  Okay.
[5165.92 --> 5166.92]  There are four ways
[5166.92 --> 5168.16]  this habit should affect us.
[5168.84 --> 5169.30]  Number one,
[5170.14 --> 5171.08]  it should affect our mindset.
[5171.78 --> 5173.16]  When we go into prayer,
[5173.44 --> 5174.98]  we don't have to go in half-hearted
[5174.98 --> 5176.20]  because we're not sure
[5176.20 --> 5176.74]  that we will get
[5176.74 --> 5177.86]  what we requested of God.
[5177.86 --> 5180.62]  We can go into prayer
[5180.62 --> 5181.60]  with the assurance
[5181.60 --> 5182.66]  and the confidence
[5182.66 --> 5183.90]  that when we open
[5183.90 --> 5184.76]  our hearts to God,
[5185.46 --> 5186.64]  that we will receive
[5186.64 --> 5188.08]  the blessings of eternal life
[5188.08 --> 5189.58]  according to his will
[5189.58 --> 5190.60]  for us
[5190.60 --> 5191.38]  because we believe
[5191.38 --> 5192.92]  that Jesus is the son of God
[5192.92 --> 5193.84]  and we believe
[5193.84 --> 5194.82]  that he is faithful.
[5196.70 --> 5197.18]  Two,
[5197.86 --> 5198.56]  it should affect
[5198.56 --> 5199.56]  what we pray for.
[5201.12 --> 5202.00]  When we pray,
[5202.08 --> 5202.76]  we can start to pray
[5202.76 --> 5204.08]  what is actually good
[5204.08 --> 5205.18]  and what is according
[5205.18 --> 5205.82]  to God's will.
[5205.82 --> 5207.00]  Like Jesus,
[5207.14 --> 5208.62]  we can openly praise God
[5208.62 --> 5209.78]  and express our fears,
[5210.00 --> 5210.58]  our joys,
[5210.98 --> 5211.78]  our sorrows,
[5212.20 --> 5213.02]  our anxieties,
[5213.42 --> 5214.40]  and petition God
[5214.40 --> 5216.04]  for our heart's desires.
[5217.20 --> 5218.84]  But we will additionally pray
[5218.84 --> 5220.38]  that God's good will be done
[5220.38 --> 5221.48]  and not ours.
[5222.16 --> 5223.56]  As we continue to pray
[5223.56 --> 5225.16]  and form a habit,
[5225.64 --> 5226.62]  we will start to see
[5226.62 --> 5227.66]  and understand
[5227.66 --> 5228.48]  more clearly
[5228.48 --> 5230.18]  what the Father's will is.
[5231.68 --> 5232.28]  Three,
[5232.98 --> 5234.10]  they should also affect
[5234.10 --> 5234.96]  how we behave towards
[5234.96 --> 5235.46]  our church
[5235.46 --> 5236.24]  and our community.
[5237.12 --> 5237.78]  When we are faced
[5237.78 --> 5238.26]  with the promise
[5238.26 --> 5239.02]  of God's good will
[5239.02 --> 5239.84]  and eternal life,
[5240.20 --> 5244.06]  we start to see God's good will
[5244.06 --> 5245.32]  is not just for ourselves
[5245.32 --> 5247.14]  but for the whole body of Christ.
[5247.84 --> 5248.72]  We start to witness
[5248.72 --> 5249.72]  the power that the promise
[5249.72 --> 5250.54]  has on each other.
[5251.20 --> 5252.10]  We see communally,
[5252.66 --> 5253.44]  as we pray,
[5253.60 --> 5255.32]  as we communally praise God
[5255.32 --> 5256.54]  and pray with him,
[5256.84 --> 5257.50]  we see the effect
[5257.50 --> 5258.34]  that it has on others.
[5258.84 --> 5260.04]  We see that God's promise
[5260.04 --> 5260.46]  is for,
[5261.14 --> 5261.94]  it's not just for us
[5261.94 --> 5262.70]  but also our brothers
[5262.70 --> 5263.58]  and sisters as well.
[5264.28 --> 5265.06]  And we start to pray
[5265.06 --> 5266.12]  for God's will for them.
[5267.60 --> 5268.36]  On the 8th,
[5268.40 --> 5269.22]  we had the prayer night
[5269.22 --> 5270.88]  and there were many of us
[5270.88 --> 5272.14]  and we prayed for many issues
[5272.14 --> 5273.08]  facing our church
[5273.08 --> 5274.38]  and the greater church at large.
[5275.04 --> 5277.06]  We opened our hearts to God.
[5277.60 --> 5279.16]  We prayed for leaders
[5279.16 --> 5279.98]  and marriages
[5279.98 --> 5281.14]  and mental health
[5281.14 --> 5282.14]  and political divisions
[5282.14 --> 5284.14]  and it was good
[5284.14 --> 5286.18]  and we left there confident
[5286.18 --> 5286.90]  that God's will
[5286.90 --> 5288.58]  would actually happen.
[5288.58 --> 5290.62]  fourth,
[5291.62 --> 5292.26]  they should affect
[5292.26 --> 5293.44]  how we act in the world.
[5294.66 --> 5295.42]  When we start to see
[5295.42 --> 5296.42]  how the power of prayer
[5296.42 --> 5297.30]  and praising God
[5297.30 --> 5298.26]  works in our lives
[5298.26 --> 5299.48]  transformatively,
[5299.60 --> 5300.40]  we see the desire
[5300.40 --> 5301.08]  that God has
[5301.08 --> 5301.62]  for the broken
[5301.62 --> 5302.40]  and the lost.
[5303.20 --> 5304.06]  We start to think
[5304.06 --> 5305.46]  missionally towards the world
[5305.46 --> 5308.12]  and those who are not yet
[5308.12 --> 5309.16]  part of the body of believers
[5309.16 --> 5310.16]  who profess the name
[5310.16 --> 5311.00]  of Jesus Christ
[5311.00 --> 5311.92]  and therefore
[5311.92 --> 5313.28]  confidently approach God.
[5314.24 --> 5315.12]  We start to work
[5315.12 --> 5316.22]  in accordance with God
[5316.22 --> 5317.58]  to pray for those
[5317.58 --> 5318.48]  who do not know him.
[5319.08 --> 5319.68]  We start to work
[5319.68 --> 5320.46]  in accordance with God
[5320.46 --> 5321.50]  to draw them actively
[5321.50 --> 5322.60]  to the body of Christ.
[5325.26 --> 5326.44]  To end this off here,
[5327.96 --> 5329.58]  here are some practical examples
[5329.58 --> 5330.70]  of how we can live this out
[5330.70 --> 5331.68]  in our lives today.
[5332.98 --> 5333.88]  In the Holy Habits
[5333.88 --> 5334.68]  companion guide
[5334.68 --> 5335.76]  that you all have,
[5336.30 --> 5337.44]  you will find four examples
[5337.44 --> 5338.12]  of how to practice
[5338.12 --> 5338.76]  the holy habit
[5338.76 --> 5339.92]  of talking with Jesus.
[5340.88 --> 5341.96]  If you don't have one,
[5342.00 --> 5342.86]  I'm sure that you can get one
[5342.86 --> 5343.32]  in the office
[5343.32 --> 5344.48]  or at the Sunday school desk
[5344.48 --> 5345.58]  right outside that window.
[5346.80 --> 5347.78]  But I want to highlight
[5347.78 --> 5349.16]  two examples,
[5349.46 --> 5350.20]  the first two examples
[5350.20 --> 5350.80]  in the workbook.
[5351.30 --> 5352.72]  The first is an individual example
[5352.72 --> 5353.18]  and the other
[5353.18 --> 5354.12]  is a communal example.
[5355.18 --> 5355.54]  First,
[5356.48 --> 5357.86]  set an alarm or two
[5357.86 --> 5358.84]  on a day when you know
[5358.84 --> 5359.54]  that you will be free
[5359.54 --> 5360.32]  at a time you will know
[5360.32 --> 5360.98]  you will be free.
[5361.60 --> 5362.38]  Like a break
[5362.38 --> 5363.48]  or when you wake up, etc.
[5364.08 --> 5365.38]  When the alarm goes off,
[5366.50 --> 5366.70]  pray.
[5367.92 --> 5368.80]  I like this one
[5368.80 --> 5370.02]  because the pattern it sets.
[5370.80 --> 5372.06]  Dedicating a time to pray
[5372.06 --> 5372.96]  or worship to God
[5372.96 --> 5373.54]  specifically
[5373.54 --> 5375.28]  for no other reason
[5375.28 --> 5377.42]  then to do so
[5377.42 --> 5378.34]  is huge
[5378.34 --> 5379.96]  and make sure
[5379.96 --> 5380.58]  that the practice
[5380.58 --> 5381.34]  is habit forming.
[5382.02 --> 5383.22]  Usually we attach prayer
[5383.22 --> 5383.88]  or worship
[5383.88 --> 5384.84]  to other activities.
[5385.66 --> 5386.18]  When we eat,
[5386.36 --> 5386.72]  we pray.
[5386.96 --> 5387.62]  When we go to bed,
[5387.72 --> 5388.12]  we pray.
[5388.40 --> 5389.18]  When we start a meeting,
[5389.32 --> 5389.72]  we pray.
[5390.84 --> 5391.60]  But we just rush
[5391.60 --> 5392.60]  through a rehearsed prayer
[5392.60 --> 5393.92]  and move to the task at hand.
[5394.72 --> 5395.82]  And though those prayers
[5395.82 --> 5396.88]  are good and habit forming,
[5397.20 --> 5398.68]  they rarely dig deep
[5398.68 --> 5399.92]  into the heart of the matter.
[5399.92 --> 5402.22]  When we set time
[5402.22 --> 5402.94]  to pray alone
[5402.94 --> 5403.84]  or worship alone,
[5404.72 --> 5405.50]  we can dig deep
[5405.50 --> 5406.52]  and work with the Spirit
[5406.52 --> 5407.70]  so that God can actively
[5407.70 --> 5409.28]  form our wills
[5409.28 --> 5410.20]  in accordance with His.
[5411.78 --> 5412.22]  Number two,
[5413.34 --> 5414.78]  get a community together
[5414.78 --> 5416.68]  to pray in an ongoing manner
[5416.68 --> 5417.22]  where the members
[5417.22 --> 5418.50]  rotate who they pray for
[5418.50 --> 5420.08]  so everyone in the group
[5420.08 --> 5420.98]  is praying for someone
[5420.98 --> 5422.72]  and is being prayed for.
[5423.84 --> 5424.94]  In the young adults,
[5425.14 --> 5425.84]  we do this.
[5425.92 --> 5426.12]  It's called
[5426.12 --> 5426.94]  the Rotating Prayer Group.
[5427.06 --> 5428.08]  Not a very inventive name.
[5428.08 --> 5430.12]  Any young adults
[5430.12 --> 5431.20]  can join at any time.
[5431.80 --> 5432.34]  And this aspect
[5432.34 --> 5432.92]  of our ministry
[5432.92 --> 5434.44]  was huge for those
[5434.44 --> 5435.86]  who, like myself
[5435.86 --> 5436.68]  during the pandemic,
[5437.64 --> 5438.82]  struggled with loneliness.
[5440.70 --> 5441.70]  God helped me
[5441.70 --> 5443.28]  get out of my apathetic mindset
[5443.28 --> 5446.14]  about life and prayer
[5446.14 --> 5447.00]  because suddenly
[5447.00 --> 5447.96]  it wasn't about me.
[5448.58 --> 5449.70]  It was about the community.
[5451.06 --> 5452.54]  The group still does it now
[5452.54 --> 5453.16]  and we're about to enter
[5453.16 --> 5454.06]  our second year of prayer
[5454.06 --> 5455.56]  and it is awesome,
[5456.42 --> 5457.00]  as Kevin said.
[5459.08 --> 5460.46]  There are more practical examples
[5460.46 --> 5461.16]  we could lay out
[5461.16 --> 5462.38]  and there are more in the book
[5462.38 --> 5463.38]  that are,
[5463.88 --> 5464.94]  but really the habit
[5464.94 --> 5466.16]  is formed through repetition,
[5466.88 --> 5468.16]  consistent repetition.
[5469.00 --> 5469.84]  And ultimately the hope
[5469.84 --> 5470.80]  is that we start to pray
[5470.80 --> 5471.78]  like Paul says
[5471.78 --> 5473.10]  in 1 Thessalonians,
[5473.64 --> 5474.74]  without ceasing.
[5475.54 --> 5476.54]  Because the more
[5476.54 --> 5478.78]  we confidently approach prayer
[5478.78 --> 5480.12]  as a means of grace
[5480.12 --> 5481.88]  to fuel our lives of faith,
[5482.40 --> 5483.62]  the more we as disciples
[5483.62 --> 5484.16]  of Jesus
[5484.16 --> 5485.90]  will be unified with Him
[5485.90 --> 5487.30]  in will and action.
[5489.80 --> 5491.76]  Let us confidently pray together
[5491.76 --> 5492.56]  to our God.
[5498.32 --> 5498.68]  Father,
[5499.14 --> 5500.86]  thank you for this day.
[5501.70 --> 5502.64]  Thank you for the love
[5502.64 --> 5503.78]  that you've shown this church
[5503.78 --> 5505.96]  and how much you've helped us.
[5506.54 --> 5507.32]  I pray for all those
[5507.32 --> 5508.30]  who have professed their faith
[5508.30 --> 5508.92]  and all the children
[5508.92 --> 5509.54]  that have graduated
[5509.54 --> 5510.36]  Sunday School, Lord.
[5510.92 --> 5511.82]  I pray that they would be
[5511.82 --> 5513.10]  confident in their faith.
[5513.10 --> 5515.00]  I pray that we would all
[5515.00 --> 5515.78]  be confident in our faith
[5515.78 --> 5516.06]  in you.
[5516.82 --> 5517.98]  And thank you for the assurance
[5517.98 --> 5519.32]  of eternal life.
[5520.00 --> 5521.02]  In Jesus' name, Lord, I pray.
[5521.34 --> 5521.52]  Amen.
[5521.52 --> 5521.62]  Amen.
[5521.62 --> 5528.26]  Please stand with us.
[5528.26 --> 5551.44]  I have a maker
[5551.44 --> 5558.44]  He formed my heart
[5558.44 --> 5564.34]  Before even time began
[5564.34 --> 5571.08]  My life was in His hand
[5571.08 --> 5576.82]  He knows my name
[5576.82 --> 5585.06]  He knows my every thought
[5585.06 --> 5590.74]  He sees each tear that falls
[5590.74 --> 5594.76]  And hears me when I go
[5594.76 --> 5605.50]  I have a father
[5605.50 --> 5610.66]  He calls me His own
[5610.66 --> 5618.24]  He'll never leave me
[5618.24 --> 5622.86]  No matter where I go
[5622.86 --> 5629.84]  He knows my name
[5629.84 --> 5637.06]  He knows my every thought
[5637.06 --> 5643.24]  He sees each tear that falls
[5643.24 --> 5673.22]  And hears me when I go
[5673.22 --> 5680.22]  And hears me when I go
[5680.22 --> 5681.22]  And hears me when I go
[5681.22 --> 5697.30]  Here's God's blessing
[5697.30 --> 5699.12]  The Lord bless you
[5699.12 --> 5699.86]  And keep you
[5699.86 --> 5701.30]  The Lord make His face
[5701.30 --> 5701.92]  Shine on you
[5701.92 --> 5703.30]  And be gracious to you
[5703.30 --> 5704.82]  The Lord turn His face
[5704.82 --> 5705.42]  Towards you
[5705.42 --> 5706.72]  And give you peace
[5706.72 --> 5707.30]  Amen

[5736.54 --> 5736.74]  Amen
[5738.30 --> 5740.94]  Amen
[5740.94 --> 5751.80]  Lord bless you and keep you
[5751.80 --> 5756.26]  Make his face shine upon you
[5756.26 --> 5759.28]  Be gracious to you
[5759.28 --> 5766.08]  Lord turn his face toward you
[5766.08 --> 5772.56]  And give you peace
[5772.56 --> 5783.32]  Lord bless you and keep you
[5783.32 --> 5787.78]  Make his face shine upon you
[5787.78 --> 5790.78]  Be gracious to you
[5790.78 --> 5797.26]  Lord turn his face toward you
[5797.26 --> 5802.78]  And give you peace
[5802.78 --> 5810.78]  Amen

[5846.78 --> 5851.10]  Please favor be upon you

[5854.26 --> 5856.14]  And your family
[5856.14 --> 5858.02]  And your children
[5858.02 --> 5859.78]  And their children
[5859.78 --> 5861.52]  And their children
[5861.52 --> 5865.32]  May his favor be upon you
[5865.32 --> 5868.58]  And a thousand generations

[5889.86 --> 5893.60]  May His presence go before you
[5893.60 --> 5897.08]  And behind you and beside you
[5897.08 --> 5900.46]  All around you and within you
[5900.46 --> 5903.92]  He is with you, He is with you
[5903.92 --> 5907.00]  In the morning, in the evening
[5907.00 --> 5910.56]  If you're coming and you're going
[5910.56 --> 5914.10]  If you're leaving and rejoicing
[5914.10 --> 5929.54]  He is for you, He is for you
[5929.54 --> 5942.10]  Amen, Amen, Amen
[5942.10 --> 5955.68]  Amen, Amen, Amen
[5955.68 --> 5969.96]  Amen, Amen, Amen
