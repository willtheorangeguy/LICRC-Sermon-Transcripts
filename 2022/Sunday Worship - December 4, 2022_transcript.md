[0.00 --> 29.98]  Thank you.
[30.00 --> 59.98]  Thank you.
[60.00 --> 89.98]  Thank you.
[90.00 --> 119.98]  Thank you.
[120.00 --> 149.98]  Thank you.
[150.00 --> 179.98]  Thank you.
[180.00 --> 209.98]  Thank you.
[210.00 --> 212.00]  Thank you.
[240.00 --> 242.00]  Thank you.
[270.00 --> 272.00]  Thank you.
[300.00 --> 302.00]  Thank you.
[330.00 --> 332.00]  Thank you.
[332.00 --> 334.00]  Thank you.
[362.00 --> 364.00]  Thank you.
[392.00 --> 394.00]  Thank you.
[422.00 --> 424.00]  Sing that one more time.
[424.00 --> 426.00]  Did you feel the darkness?
[426.00 --> 430.00]  Did you feel the darkness tremble?
[430.00 --> 432.00]  When all the saints?
[432.00 --> 436.00]  When all the saints joined in one song?
[436.00 --> 448.00]  And all the streams flowed as one river to wash away our brokenness.
[448.00 --> 454.00]  Open up the doors.
[454.00 --> 456.00]  Open up the doors.
[456.00 --> 458.00]  Open up the doors.
[458.00 --> 464.00]  And let the doors and let the music play.
[464.00 --> 468.00]  Let the streets resound with singing.
[468.00 --> 470.00]  Peace out with singing.
[470.00 --> 474.00]  Peace out with singing.
[474.00 --> 476.00]  With songs that bring you.
[476.00 --> 482.00]  With songs that bring your joy.
[482.00 --> 484.00]  And songs that bring your joy.
[484.00 --> 486.00]  And all the dancers.
[486.00 --> 490.00]  And all the dancers who dance upon injustice.
[490.00 --> 492.00]  Oh, upon injustice.
[492.00 --> 494.00]  Oh, upon injustice.
[494.00 --> 496.00]  Oh, Lord.
[496.00 --> 498.00]  Upon injustice.
[498.00 --> 502.00]  Oh, Jesus.
[502.00 --> 503.00]  Lord.
[503.00 --> 504.00]  We dance upon injustice.
[504.00 --> 506.00]  We dance upon the pride.
[506.00 --> 508.00]  We dance upon the fear.
[508.00 --> 510.00]  We dance upon insecurity, Lord.
[510.00 --> 512.00]  We dance upon injustice.
[512.00 --> 514.00]  Yeah.
[514.00 --> 516.00]  Oh, upon injustice, Lord.
[516.00 --> 518.00]  Injustice, Lord.
[518.00 --> 519.00]  It's here no more.
[519.00 --> 520.00]  It's here no more.
[520.00 --> 521.00]  It's here no more.
[521.00 --> 522.00]  Injustice, Lord.
[522.00 --> 523.00]  It's here no more.
[523.00 --> 524.00]  In Jesus' name.
[524.00 --> 525.00]  Injustice, Lord.
[525.00 --> 526.00]  Injustice, Lord.
[526.00 --> 531.00]  Injustice, Lord.
[531.00 --> 534.00]  It's here no more.
[534.00 --> 536.00]  Injustice, Lord.
[538.00 --> 540.40]  It's here no more.
[540.40 --> 543.00]  In Jesus' name.
[546.00 --> 549.00]  Injustice, Lord.
[549.00 --> 551.00]  Injustice, Lord.
[551.00 --> 554.00]  It's here no more.
[554.00 --> 566.24]  Let me sing it one more time.
[566.24 --> 571.44]  Open up the door.
[571.44 --> 576.44]  Let me sing it one more time.
[576.44 --> 582.44]  Let me sing it one more time.
[582.44 --> 585.04]  These are your streets, Lord.
[585.04 --> 586.44]  Bring your hope and joy.
[586.44 --> 606.04]  Let me sing it one more time.
[606.04 --> 612.64]  Open up the door.
[612.64 --> 618.64]  Let the music play.
[618.64 --> 626.64]  Let the streets resound in singing.
[626.64 --> 629.64]  Woo!
[629.64 --> 634.64]  Songs that bring your hope.
[634.64 --> 639.64]  Songs that bring your hope.
[639.64 --> 643.64]  Men to church resound in singing.
[643.64 --> 647.64]  Come on, you're safe.
[647.64 --> 653.64]  I believe when I first heard about the Tehillah praise, I thought I'd be like, I'm gonna
[653.64 --> 654.64]  sing it one more time.
[654.64 --> 660.64]  I believe when I first heard about the Tehillah praise, I thought the only kind of song that
[660.64 --> 667.64]  we were talking about is a song that was just made up right there on the spot, which I think
[667.64 --> 669.64]  that is something that we're doing already here tonight.
[669.64 --> 676.64]  I also believe that you can take an old song and make it a new song if you sing it from your
[676.64 --> 678.64]  heart and you mean it.
[678.64 --> 685.64]  So as we sing this song, would you just lift up God's name and thank Him for the sacrifice
[685.64 --> 692.64]  that He made on the cross for us.
[692.64 --> 694.64]  For us.
[694.64 --> 695.64]  But, Lord, we're gonna have to sing it one more time.
[695.64 --> 701.64]  So as we sing this song, would you just lift up God's name and thank Him for the sacrifice
[701.64 --> 703.64]  that He made on the cross for us.
[703.64 --> 704.64]  For us.
[733.64 --> 735.64]  Great mother.
[735.64 --> 736.64]  Thank you.
[736.64 --> 737.64]  Thank you.
[737.64 --> 754.28]  You need Jackie, right.
[754.28 --> 755.32]  Good.
[755.32 --> 759.10]  David Johnson
[759.10 --> 760.90]  Now that we're all awake, good morning.
[762.28 --> 764.64]  Welcome to worship.
[764.96 --> 770.16]  A special welcome if you are visiting with us this morning or if you're checking us out online.
[770.50 --> 778.40]  We are glad that you are all here and that we can come together to worship our good God this morning.
[779.16 --> 781.94]  Before we begin, we have a couple announcements.
[781.94 --> 792.48]  We have been advertising for a new members class that's going to happen today after our worship here.
[792.72 --> 798.50]  And so if you are a guest with us, if you've been here for a little while and you have some questions
[798.50 --> 806.02]  or you want to wonder together about what membership here looks like and what that means for you and for us with you,
[806.32 --> 807.68]  this is the class to come to.
[807.68 --> 814.12]  And so we are going to go after service, grab a coffee, say hi to a friend,
[814.22 --> 817.74]  and then we're going to head down the hallway on the right to the very end.
[818.16 --> 820.40]  Very end of the hallway, room 114.
[820.68 --> 822.12]  That's where we're going to be located.
[822.40 --> 826.32]  So I encourage you to come with your questions and chat there.
[827.52 --> 833.58]  The reason we are going down to the end of the hallway is because there's a kids' choir practice after service this morning.
[833.58 --> 838.72]  And so kids who are participating in that, you go to the multi-purpose room.
[839.00 --> 842.32]  Mark will be there and he will get you going in that regard.
[843.38 --> 848.58]  The kids' choir is for an event that we are hosting on December 18th.
[848.58 --> 851.30]  December 18th in the evening at 6 p.m.
[851.30 --> 857.18]  We are having a choir concert and a traditional carol and hymn sing along with that.
[857.88 --> 865.00]  We have made some invitations that if you have a mailbox here, they're in your mailbox.
[865.30 --> 871.36]  There's also some other invitations at the Connect table in the back there that you can take and use to give to your neighbor
[871.36 --> 878.30]  or a friend or a family member and invite them to participate in that evening of our shared worship
[878.30 --> 880.94]  and Christmas caroling together.
[881.30 --> 888.62]  Also, December 9th is the women's Christmas evening.
[888.80 --> 890.36]  You can still sign up for that at the back.
[891.52 --> 895.16]  There's coming up on 100 people signed up for that, which is amazing.
[895.46 --> 897.20]  And I trust that that will be awesome.
[897.46 --> 899.94]  And so sign up for that at the back, ladies.
[900.18 --> 904.16]  And if you have any questions, there will be some people there who can address those with you.
[904.16 --> 912.18]  Additionally, this afternoon after service is Youth Coffee at Paul and Leslie Kuhl's house.
[912.28 --> 913.36]  Paul and Leslie, wave your hand.
[913.82 --> 915.68]  If you don't know where that is, you can talk to them.
[915.82 --> 916.50]  They will get you there.
[916.50 --> 925.16]  And this evening, our young adults are heading over to Maple Ridge Church for a combined young adult worship event.
[925.62 --> 929.52]  So if you have any questions on that, you can find a young adult.
[929.58 --> 931.10]  I don't see Josh yet this morning.
[932.20 --> 932.54]  Okay.
[932.68 --> 933.86]  We'll have a meeting this week.
[933.86 --> 939.62]  But if you have any questions about that, grab Pastor Kevin or myself.
[939.92 --> 943.12]  And if Josh shows up, him will give you details on that.
[943.70 --> 947.76]  And then lastly, next weekend is a youth lock-in event.
[948.56 --> 950.60]  And so that's Friday to Saturday.
[951.38 --> 954.10]  If you have any questions on that, you can grab Pastor Kevin.
[955.68 --> 956.86]  I think that's it.
[957.08 --> 957.64]  Did I get them all?
[957.76 --> 957.96]  Maybe?
[958.10 --> 959.10]  That was a long list of things.
[959.30 --> 959.50]  Okay.
[959.50 --> 962.34]  We are going to worship God together.
[962.48 --> 970.10]  And so I'm going to invite you, as you are able to stand, we might be called and ushered into God's presence by the receiving of his greeting.
[970.86 --> 976.38]  After we have been greeted by God, we will light our next Advent candle.
[976.64 --> 981.58]  And so, Joan and Juanita, if you can come to the front just after the greeting, we can transition that way.
[983.64 --> 986.44]  In the presence of God, receive his greeting.
[987.70 --> 988.14]  Grace.
[989.00 --> 989.40]  Mercy.
[989.50 --> 990.86]  And peace to you.
[991.36 --> 992.44]  From God, our Father.
[992.52 --> 995.42]  From the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son, and our Savior.
[995.90 --> 998.68]  Through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[1000.00 --> 1000.44]  Amen.
[1000.44 --> 1000.54]  Amen.
[1019.50 --> 1032.80]  Advent is a season of waiting, waiting for the light in the darkness, waiting to be filled while empty, waiting for the return of the King.
[1032.80 --> 1034.80]  From the beginning, Christians have faith.
[1034.80 --> 1039.06]  From the beginning, Christians have faith, death, and persecution for our faith.
[1039.06 --> 1047.00]  While we live in a time and place of relative peace and ease, we know that this is not true for many of our brothers and sisters around the world.
[1047.00 --> 1050.00]  Nor has it always been true for Christians throughout history.
[1050.00 --> 1051.18]  Nor has it always been true for Christians throughout history.
[1051.18 --> 1053.22]  And maybe it won't be true for us in the future.
[1053.22 --> 1060.10]  And yet, we know that the greater ending to come will bring utter and complete joy for those who believe.
[1060.10 --> 1074.34]  Living in anticipation of the return of the King invites us to be a people of patient endurance and faith, who can live with rejoicing in the world to come, and with deep joy in the world that is.
[1074.34 --> 1080.30]  We light this candle as a reminder of our joy, persisting in the darkness as we wait.
[1084.88 --> 1087.32]  The voice of the world is loud.
[1087.96 --> 1089.76]  The darkness is deep.
[1090.52 --> 1094.44]  Into the chaos and confusion, Jesus speaks with the clarion call.
[1095.10 --> 1096.84]  I am the light of the world.
[1097.52 --> 1099.68]  You will be a light to the world.
[1104.34 --> 1107.90]  pressure the lines and joy
[1109.18 --> 1114.68]  in the light ofstop turning to the alien sa hatten'
[1114.94 --> 1115.94]  And sermons in a little bit more boldly.
[1116.94 --> 1118.06]  I am the president at the artist's geldi speaks withingen within maroon
[1118.06 --> 1122.62]  and the composer which I look again like confirm.
[1123.02 --> 1126.44]  After the current film I hear you, Father, God, after all, he is strong.
[1130.88 --> 1133.60]  Ooh dice, otras lyàn to the saints,
[1133.60 --> 1144.58]  From the squalor of the borrowed stable, by the spirit and of urgent pain,
[1144.58 --> 1155.50]  to the anguish and the shame of scandal, came the sinner of the human race.
[1155.50 --> 1166.32]  When the skies were filled with the rays of them, shepherds listened and the angels said,
[1166.32 --> 1176.52]  Hold the gift of faith, come down to them, bow the dawning of Emmanuel.
[1176.52 --> 1192.34]  King of heaven, now the friend of sinners, humble servant in the Father's hands,
[1192.34 --> 1202.34]  filled with power and the Holy Spirit, filled with mercy for the broken man.
[1202.34 --> 1214.20]  Yes, he walked my road and he felt my pain, joys and sorrows that I know so well.
[1214.20 --> 1224.62]  In his righteousness, giving hope again, I will follow the Emmanuel.
[1224.62 --> 1241.10]  Through the kisses of a friend's betrayal, he was lifted on a cruel cross.
[1241.10 --> 1246.86]  He was punished for the world's transgressions.
[1247.06 --> 1252.32]  He was suffering to save the lost.
[1252.32 --> 1258.68]  He fights for birth, he fights for me,
[1258.68 --> 1263.40]  Loosing sinners from the claims of death,
[1263.40 --> 1269.26]  And with the shame our souls are free,
[1269.26 --> 1273.26]  Left in the body of heaven.
[1273.26 --> 1285.44]  while I pray to form God,
[1285.44 --> 1293.08]  sing in thy NASS apost ditches to save Himself to our northern love.
[1293.08 --> 1295.64]  His only love
[1295.64 --> 1298.20]  Till His Father
[1298.20 --> 1301.10]  Must be born
[1301.10 --> 1305.02]  In the skies we'll burn
[1305.02 --> 1308.28]  As the trumpet sounds
[1308.28 --> 1310.46]  The world's heaven
[1310.46 --> 1312.98]  Without fear of death
[1312.98 --> 1315.60]  With the bride we'll walk
[1315.60 --> 1318.88]  Till your lover's last
[1318.88 --> 1322.88]  Give glory to the Lord
[1322.88 --> 1327.64]  In the skies we'll burn
[1327.64 --> 1330.94]  As the trumpet sounds
[1330.94 --> 1333.18]  The love of heaven
[1333.18 --> 1335.78]  Or the fear of hell
[1335.78 --> 1338.50]  But the bride we'll walk
[1338.50 --> 1341.94]  To her lover's house
[1341.94 --> 1346.46]  Giving glory to the Lord
[1346.46 --> 1374.30]  To your token
[1374.30 --> 1391.76]  What gift of grace is Jesus my Redeemer?
[1391.76 --> 1398.76]  There is no more for heaven now to give.
[1398.76 --> 1406.20]  He is my joy, my righteousness and freedom,
[1406.20 --> 1413.76]  my steadfast love, my deep and foulest peace.
[1413.76 --> 1420.76]  To this I roll, my hope is holy, Jesus,
[1420.76 --> 1428.74]  for my life is holy, bound to His love.
[1428.76 --> 1435.64]  Oh, how sweet and beyond, I can see God is one,
[1435.64 --> 1440.94]  yet not I can through Christ in me.
[1440.94 --> 1457.82]  The night is dark, but I am not forsaken,
[1457.82 --> 1464.70]  for in my sight, the Savior, He will stay.
[1464.70 --> 1471.58]  I labor on in weakness and rejoicing,
[1471.58 --> 1477.58]  for in my need, His power is to speak.
[1477.58 --> 1486.46]  To this I roll, my shepherd will defend me,
[1486.46 --> 1492.46]  through the deepest valley He will lead me.
[1492.46 --> 1499.34]  Oh, how sweet and beyond, I can see God is one,
[1499.34 --> 1503.34]  I can see God is one, I can see God is one,
[1503.34 --> 1516.22]  God is one, I can see God is one, I can see God is one,
[1516.22 --> 1522.22]  so pleased I dread, I know I am forgiven.
[1522.22 --> 1531.10]  The future sure, the price it has been paid.
[1531.10 --> 1537.10]  For Jesus bled and suffered for my garden,
[1537.10 --> 1543.98]  and He was raised to overthrow the grave.
[1543.98 --> 1549.98]  To this I roll, my sin has been defeated,
[1549.98 --> 1557.98]  now Jesus now and ever is my King.
[1557.98 --> 1564.86]  And I can change me, I can see God is one,
[1564.86 --> 1568.86]  I can see God is one, I can see God is one,
[1568.86 --> 1572.86]  and He will be with me.
[1572.86 --> 1576.86]  And I will be with you.
[1576.86 --> 1580.86]  And I will be with you.
[1580.86 --> 1586.86]  With every prayer, I long to follow Jesus,
[1586.86 --> 1595.74]  for He has said that He will bring me home.
[1595.74 --> 1601.74]  And day by day, I know He will be with me,
[1601.74 --> 1607.74]  until I stand with joy before the Lord.
[1607.74 --> 1615.74]  To this I roll, my hope is all redeemed of.
[1615.74 --> 1622.62]  For the glory evermore to you.
[1622.62 --> 1625.62]  And the grace is renewed,
[1625.62 --> 1629.62]  so I live, shall we be,
[1629.62 --> 1635.62]  that you're ever with us in me.
[1635.62 --> 1643.50]  To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus.
[1643.50 --> 1650.50]  Oh, the glory evermore to Him.
[1650.50 --> 1657.50]  When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat,
[1657.50 --> 1664.38]  yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[1664.38 --> 1667.38]  When the race is complete,
[1667.38 --> 1671.38]  still my lips shall repeat,
[1671.38 --> 1678.38]  yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[1678.38 --> 1686.26]  When the grace is complete, still my lips shall repeat,
[1686.26 --> 1689.26]  yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[1689.26 --> 1699.14]  When the grace is complete, still my lips shall repeat,
[1699.14 --> 1703.14]  yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[1703.14 --> 1706.14]  Our confession and assurance comes to us from Psalm 13.
[1706.14 --> 1707.14]  Psalm 13.
[1707.14 --> 1708.14]  How long, O Lord?
[1708.14 --> 1709.14]  How long, O Lord?
[1709.14 --> 1711.14]  Will you forget me forever?
[1711.14 --> 1716.02]  How long will you hide your face from me?
[1716.02 --> 1720.02]  How long must I take counsel in my soul,
[1720.02 --> 1724.02]  and have sorrow in my heart all the day?
[1724.02 --> 1728.02]  How long shall my enemy be exalted over me?
[1728.02 --> 1732.90]  Consider and answer me, O Lord my God.
[1732.90 --> 1737.90]  Light up my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death.
[1737.90 --> 1742.40]  Lest my enemies say, I have prevailed over him.
[1742.40 --> 1746.98]  Lest my foes rejoice, because I am shaken.
[1746.98 --> 1750.32]  But I have trusted in your steadfast love.
[1750.32 --> 1754.40]  My heart shall rejoice in your salvation.
[1754.40 --> 1756.82]  I will sing to the Lord,
[1756.82 --> 1759.20]  because he has dealt bountifully with me.
[1786.82 --> 1792.82]  He has dealt with you.
[1792.82 --> 1795.20]  He has dealt with you.
[1795.20 --> 1799.20]  We have prayed to you forever.
[1799.20 --> 1803.20]  We have cried for your compassion,
[1803.20 --> 1806.20]  to renew the land of the earth.
[1806.20 --> 1810.34]  You will serve me in your presence,
[1810.34 --> 1813.74]  our heart will be in your heart.
[1813.74 --> 1817.12]  You are on your steps of mercy,
[1817.12 --> 1822.12]  and we're knocking at your door.
[1822.12 --> 1829.12]  How long before you touch the barren land?
[1829.12 --> 1836.50]  How long before we see your righteous hand?
[1836.50 --> 1844.12]  How long before your name is left to die?
[1844.12 --> 1851.12]  How long before the weeping turns to stop the truth?
[1851.12 --> 1859.12]  How long before the weeping turns to stop the truth?
[1859.12 --> 1863.50]  We know your heart is broken,
[1863.50 --> 1866.50]  by the evil that you see.
[1866.50 --> 1870.50]  And you've stayed your hand on judgment,
[1870.50 --> 1874.04]  for you planned to set him free.
[1874.04 --> 1878.00]  But the land is still in darkness,
[1878.00 --> 1881.60]  and we fail from what is right.
[1881.60 --> 1888.86]  We have failed to slide the children, though we'll never see the light.
[1888.86 --> 1903.80]  How long before you change the plan? How long before we see your righteous hand?
[1903.80 --> 1918.86]  How long before your name is lifted? How long before the leaders to stand?
[1918.86 --> 1925.86]  How long before you change the plan?

[1933.86 --> 1940.86]  When the world screams and the spirit will hear the truth.
[1940.86 --> 1947.86]  When the world finds a husband, when the life is lifted?
[1947.86 --> 1954.86]  When the earth can burn to my birth, when the man is lifted?
[1954.86 --> 1962.86]  How long before your name is lifted? How long before your name is lifted?
[1962.86 --> 1976.86]  How long before your rain and tears arise? How long before your fear until the Lord?
[1976.86 --> 1987.86]  How long before the earth returns with salt and salt?

[2267.56 --> 2279.56]  This morning in our worship together, we are excited to officially welcome the Nordham family, who have been worshiping with us for some time.
[2279.56 --> 2284.56]  Nico and Denise, mom and dad, Nordham, are already involved in different ministries.
[2284.56 --> 2288.56]  Denise is connected to Coffee Break and Nico to Cadets.
[2288.56 --> 2296.56]  And so this morning, we are going to officially welcome them into our church family as members.
[2296.56 --> 2304.56]  And so if you're joining us later in the new members class, this is one of the steps along that journey.
[2304.56 --> 2312.56]  And so in just a moment, I'm going to invite you guys up to the front and you can just take a spot somewhere up here.
[2312.56 --> 2313.56]  Find room.
[2313.56 --> 2316.56]  But come when I call.
[2316.56 --> 2321.56]  Nico, Denise, Levi, Austin, Karis, and Isla.
[2321.56 --> 2326.56]  We want to welcome you into the fellowship of this church.
[2326.56 --> 2346.56]  It's our hope and prayer that here your faith in God will be strengthened, that your love for Jesus will be grown, and that you will find continued opportunity to serve in the spirit as you join with us on mission for Jesus in the world through Langley and beyond.
[2346.56 --> 2353.56]  As we welcome you into our church family, we're going to ask you to affirm your faith with a few questions.
[2353.56 --> 2355.56]  And so I'm going to invite you to come up.
[2355.56 --> 2358.56]  If the kids want to come, they are more than welcome to as well.
[2358.56 --> 2359.56]  Come on up.
[2359.56 --> 2361.56]  Why don't you guys come over here?
[2361.56 --> 2374.56]  I won't make you stand in the middle.
[2374.56 --> 2379.56]  All right.
[2379.56 --> 2389.56]  So I'm going to ask three questions and then I will hand you the microphone to give you a response.
[2389.56 --> 2396.56]  Mom and Dad are going to answer on behalf of everyone, but if you guys want to answer too, you can.
[2396.56 --> 2397.56]  No.
[2398.56 --> 2400.56]  We'll work on that.
[2400.56 --> 2410.56]  One, do you believe in Jesus as your Savior and Lord and that in Him alone is hope and freedom from sin found?
[2410.56 --> 2422.56]  Two, do you believe that the Bible is the Word of God revealing His plan for redemption in Jesus Christ and that the preaching and teaching of Langley and Emmanuel reflect this truth?
[2422.56 --> 2435.56]  And three, do you promise with the help of the Holy Spirit and the church here to do all that you can to strengthen your relationship to Jesus by being a part of this church family?
[2435.56 --> 2444.56]  Do you recognize its oversight and authority and join with us on mission for Jesus in this community, in this city, and to the world?
[2444.56 --> 2447.56]  Nico and Denise, what is your answer?
[2447.56 --> 2450.56]  We do.
[2450.56 --> 2451.56]  We do.
[2451.56 --> 2452.56]  God helping us.
[2452.56 --> 2453.56]  Excellent.
[2453.56 --> 2455.56]  Thank you very much.
[2455.56 --> 2459.56]  Welcome officially to our church family.
[2459.56 --> 2460.56]  You guys can go.
[2460.56 --> 2478.56]  Nico and Denise love being the center of attention and so please grab them after the service and welcome them and embrace them with your love.
[2478.56 --> 2483.56]  Deacons, would you introduce the offering for us at this point?
[2483.56 --> 2496.56]  Not that short.
[2496.56 --> 2497.56]  Sorry.
[2497.56 --> 2500.56]  Good morning.
[2500.56 --> 2516.56]  Today the offerings are for our budget, for all the programs of our church and for the ongoing expenses.
[2516.56 --> 2519.56]  The second is for Langley Food Bank.
[2519.56 --> 2526.62]  At this time of year, there is more need for extra support besides the regular food twice a week.
[2526.62 --> 2530.60]  They need money to buy items that don't get donated.
[2531.40 --> 2538.04]  Please give generously and cheerfully and pray that they can help those they serve.
[2538.44 --> 2548.88]  Right now, they need individual packaged granola bars, applesauce, pudding cups, dry beans, and juice boxes.
[2548.88 --> 2552.80]  Canned fruit, meat, and fish, and rice.
[2553.46 --> 2554.40]  A big list.
[2555.02 --> 2557.56]  Next week, we will have a reverse offering.
[2558.38 --> 2565.74]  If you know someone who you could bless with an extra gift card, then you can take one or two at that time.
[2578.88 --> 2589.10]  We hold the star of Bethlehem.
[2589.10 --> 2595.60]  The word of God has made the flesh.
[2595.60 --> 2601.22]  Until us, a child is born.
[2601.70 --> 2606.82]  The Savior of this broken world.
[2608.70 --> 2613.78]  Hear the angel voices.
[2613.78 --> 2620.84]  Sing, come, let us adore Him.
[2620.84 --> 2628.84]  Peace, us now, for our King is with us.
[2628.84 --> 2633.84]  Fully gone.
[2633.84 --> 2635.64]  Fully gone.
[2635.90 --> 2638.62]  Fully now.
[2638.62 --> 2641.72]  He comes for all.
[2641.72 --> 2644.70]  With open hands.
[2644.70 --> 2647.64]  He rules with love.
[2647.90 --> 2650.38]  On David's throne.
[2650.80 --> 2653.06]  All praise belongs.
[2653.70 --> 2655.72]  To Christ alone.
[2655.72 --> 2662.64]  O hear the angel voices.
[2662.64 --> 2669.28]  Sing, come, let us adore Him.
[2669.28 --> 2676.86]  Peace has come, and our King is with us.
[2676.86 --> 2706.84]  Peace has come, and our King is with us.
[2706.84 --> 2710.76]  Let us adore Him.
[2710.76 --> 2716.72]  O come, let us adore Him.
[2716.72 --> 2722.40]  O come, let us adore Him.
[2722.40 --> 2726.76]  In Christ alone.
[2726.76 --> 2734.40]  O come, let us adore Him.
[2734.40 --> 2740.32]  O come, let us adore Him.
[2740.32 --> 2742.28]  O come, let us adore Him.
[2742.28 --> 2744.28]  O come, let us adore Him.
[2744.28 --> 2746.28]  O come, let us adore Him.
[2746.28 --> 2750.28]  In Christ alone.
[2750.28 --> 2760.16]  O come, let us adore Him.
[2760.16 --> 2762.16]  O come, let us adore Him.
[2762.16 --> 2764.16]  O come, let us adore Him.
[2764.16 --> 2776.04]  O come, let us adore Him.
[2776.04 --> 2787.92]  O come, let us adore Him.
[2787.92 --> 2789.92]  O come, let us adore Him.
[2789.92 --> 2791.92]  O come, let us adore Him.
[2791.92 --> 2795.80]  O come, let us adore Him.
[2795.80 --> 2799.80]  O come, let us adore Him.
[2799.80 --> 2801.68]  O come, let us adore Him.
[2801.68 --> 2803.68]  O come, let us adore Him.
[2803.68 --> 2805.72]  O come, let us adore Him.
[2805.72 --> 2807.60]  O come, let us adore Him.
[2807.60 --> 2809.60]  O come, let us adore Him.
[2809.60 --> 2811.60]  O come, let us adore Him.
[2811.60 --> 2815.60]  O come, let us adore Him.
[2815.60 --> 2817.48]  And hopefully, it's good to do.
[2817.48 --> 2821.10]  So today, the last time we're going to try and worship.
[2821.10 --> 2824.88]  If it doesn't work today, then we'll just post it online and y'all can see it there.
[2824.88 --> 2832.12]  But I think, Levi, Dave, are we good to go?
[2832.86 --> 2836.86]  To canta bo Santo, Santo
[2839.60 --> 2841.52]  Santo Santo

[2917.72 --> 2934.72]  Athena
[2935.66 --> 2940.66]  I
[2947.72 --> 2950.10]  So qui lo verte.
[2952.16 --> 2954.30]  So qui lo verte.
[2956.36 --> 2958.56]  So qui lo verte.
[2972.88 --> 2973.98]  Of course that's in there.
[2975.74 --> 2977.42]  So there's the video and all that.
[2977.72 --> 2983.42]  It's kind of a good segue into we're already planning for 2023 and the spring trip then.
[2984.20 --> 2986.68]  So with that, we are starting the sign up.
[2986.98 --> 2990.48]  The sign up will be kind of back there on one of the tables over there.
[2990.52 --> 2993.22]  And that's for all members of the church, really.
[2993.58 --> 2998.46]  Young adults, youth, older adults, if you want to call it that.
[2999.56 --> 3002.48]  Grade 10s to 12 for the youth are welcome to come.
[3003.36 --> 3005.22]  The cutoff is grade 10 for that.
[3005.86 --> 3010.88]  But we will be doing it again in the spring, like the, what do you call that, spring break for the kids.
[3011.56 --> 3014.44]  So the actual dates of the trip aren't fully planned yet.
[3014.92 --> 3017.46]  But it will be somewhere in that March 11th to the 27th.
[3018.12 --> 3021.00]  The trip cost will be the same as it was last year.
[3021.06 --> 3025.12]  It will be $11.50 for each adult youth leader, things like that.
[3025.12 --> 3035.36]  The sign up, the only thing that's different for the youth especially that's compared to last year is we're going to move everything kind of, besides the actual registration, everything else will be moved online.
[3035.36 --> 3038.80]  What that means is I don't want photocopies of your passports anymore.
[3039.06 --> 3041.06]  Just send them in an email, just a picture.
[3042.26 --> 3045.76]  We're going to put them in a Google Drive like we did last year, and it's just a lot easier to do it that way.
[3046.18 --> 3052.68]  Then the leaders can access your health care and all that anywhere they are instead of always having to have this piece of paper with them.
[3053.32 --> 3055.20]  So that's the big one, big change.
[3055.52 --> 3058.88]  Due date for this will also be Christmas Day, March 25th.
[3058.88 --> 3064.08]  Then our first meeting will be on, I think it's January 15th of the Sunday, which is just two weeks after New Year's.
[3065.12 --> 3071.70]  Leaders, if you are wanting to come on this trip as a youth leader, please fill out the application as well, do the deposit and all that.
[3071.78 --> 3078.56]  But also, can you just text me that you're planning on coming just so I can have a kind of a general idea of numbers and if we need more male or female leaders,
[3078.78 --> 3081.28]  then I can pressure and guilt trip the rest of them.
[3081.54 --> 3082.90]  So thank you.
[3088.88 --> 3092.54]  All right.
[3093.24 --> 3099.70]  Any kids that are here who are age three, up to grade four, welcome to come join me up front.
[3103.26 --> 3103.78]  Hello.
[3110.50 --> 3112.10]  Oh, you're so far away.
[3112.54 --> 3114.24]  You're going to have a hard time seeing the pictures.
[3115.00 --> 3118.50]  You can scooch forward or use your binocular eyes.
[3118.88 --> 3128.00]  So today in children's worship time, we are going to be talking about God's purpose.
[3128.78 --> 3136.16]  And we're going to be talking about how it is so important that we listen to God when we're trying to figure out what our purpose is.
[3136.74 --> 3140.64]  Now, we've also been reading this Christmas book up front here.
[3140.72 --> 3144.14]  So we're going to continue on with the grandpa's story today.
[3144.14 --> 3152.38]  And I think you'll find as an example that what we're going to read today is an example of people not listening to what God's purpose is.
[3153.18 --> 3154.82]  So let's continue on.
[3154.88 --> 3160.74]  So if you weren't here last week, the grandpa was telling a story to his grandson named Charlie.
[3160.74 --> 3164.16]  And so this is the very beginning of the story.
[3167.16 --> 3170.66]  Once upon a time, there was a great king who was the king of light.
[3170.66 --> 3172.22]  He lived in the light.
[3172.22 --> 3178.82]  He made the light and his light was so perfect and pure that he was called the king without a shadow.
[3179.56 --> 3186.62]  This great king of light made a group of people and he made them so that they could shine brightly just as he did.
[3187.14 --> 3189.00]  He called them his little lightlings.
[3189.70 --> 3193.36]  He set the lightlings in a beautiful garden that he had prepared for them.
[3193.36 --> 3196.26]  A garden that was full of bright sunshine.
[3196.98 --> 3202.66]  The sun bathed the garden every day and helped the flowers, plants, and fruit grow in great abundance.
[3203.76 --> 3206.84]  The bright light of the sun helped keep everyone warm in the garden.
[3207.52 --> 3211.38]  The lightlings loved it when the king came to visit them at the end of the day.
[3214.22 --> 3216.46]  But one day, something terrible happened.
[3217.10 --> 3222.06]  The lightlings decided to do what they wanted instead of what their king commanded them to do.
[3222.06 --> 3226.06]  So they disobeyed the king and sinned against him.
[3226.78 --> 3232.66]  The very moment they sinned, their light became dim and they were filled with shame and great embarrassment.
[3233.50 --> 3236.34]  They ran as fast as they could to get away from the king.
[3236.80 --> 3238.78]  They didn't want the king of light to see them.
[3239.36 --> 3244.46]  They ran out of the garden and into the woods and hid themselves in the darkest place they could find.
[3245.24 --> 3251.24]  From then on, they were afraid of the light because they knew that where the light was, the king would be.
[3251.24 --> 3253.64]  And the king would see them in their shame.
[3257.48 --> 3258.84]  I'll show you one more picture.
[3262.42 --> 3264.00]  We're going to finish the story right there.
[3264.10 --> 3269.86]  It's kind of a blessing part to finish, but you'll have to wait until next week to find out what happens.
[3271.18 --> 3276.78]  Before we go to children's worship time, let's stand up and let's bless the rest of our church family and receive their blessing.
[3276.78 --> 3282.02]  Ready?
[3282.02 --> 3285.02]  The Lord be with you.
[3285.02 --> 3287.14]  The Lord be with you.
[3287.14 --> 3309.42]  Good morning.
[3309.42 --> 3310.98]  My name is Ken.
[3311.14 --> 3316.50]  I'm an elder here at Emmanuel Christian Reformed Church and I will be leading us in our church family prayer this morning.
[3317.10 --> 3319.40]  Before we do that, just a couple things to point out.
[3319.60 --> 3326.14]  First, next Sunday is going to be our Sunday that we participate in communion and come together at the table for the Lord's Supper.
[3326.64 --> 3328.92]  And so you're encouraged to think about that this week.
[3329.06 --> 3333.02]  Prepare your hearts for that and talk to your kids about it and what we're doing and what it means.
[3333.02 --> 3344.52]  And after the service next Sunday, we're also going to have a special cake and coffee celebration for the many years that Sylvia Welfing has poured into the administrative team here at Emmanuel.
[3345.08 --> 3353.86]  And you're all welcome to join us there as well as we give our thanks and well wishes to Sylvia in her next step of her journey of her career.
[3353.86 --> 3358.68]  And now let's bow our heads and come to our Lord in prayer.
[3360.30 --> 3367.36]  Our Father in heaven, we're thankful that we can gather together to praise and glorify your name together this beautiful morning.
[3368.10 --> 3373.92]  In this time of Advent waiting, as we look ahead to again celebrating the birth of Christ's child,
[3374.38 --> 3382.32]  we are so thankful and amazed at how you came into the world in the humblest of ways to live among us, to be able to relate to us.
[3382.32 --> 3386.40]  Meekness and majesty, what a mystery.
[3387.42 --> 3392.56]  Lord, we thank you for filling our hearts with the joy of our salvation in this time and place.
[3393.12 --> 3397.22]  And we pray that you continue to fill us in all times and all places.
[3398.52 --> 3402.80]  As we've just sung, Lord, peace has come and our King is with us.
[3403.50 --> 3408.48]  Thank you for always being with us, even when we're distracted by the things of this world.
[3408.48 --> 3414.90]  But even as you're saved people living in the certainty that peace has come,
[3415.40 --> 3418.20]  Lord, we acknowledge that we still have challenges, hurts, and struggles.
[3418.62 --> 3422.68]  And we bring those to you together as a community of your people this morning.
[3423.88 --> 3427.82]  Lord, as your people, we are struggling with mental health and anxiety.
[3428.76 --> 3430.96]  Replace the fear in us with your peace.
[3432.22 --> 3435.42]  Lord, we're hurting from the loss of dear loved ones.
[3435.42 --> 3438.96]  Replace the grief in us with your peace.
[3440.02 --> 3443.52]  Lord, we're burdened with strained and damaged relationships.
[3444.66 --> 3447.52]  Replace the brokenness in us with your peace.
[3448.68 --> 3451.78]  And Lord, some of us are sick with illnesses and failing bodies.
[3452.36 --> 3456.10]  We ask that you please restore our health and heal our sicknesses and diseases.
[3456.10 --> 3465.24]  Lord, some are trapped in addictions to chemicals, to behaviors, or to the deceit of so-called pleasures of this world.
[3466.20 --> 3469.28]  Break the chains of addictions, Lord, in our lives.
[3469.66 --> 3473.40]  And help us experience the freedom and peace of overcoming addiction.
[3473.40 --> 3480.06]  Lord, we can be overwhelmed with the challenges of exams and projects as the school semester ends.
[3480.86 --> 3485.50]  Give us clear and sharp minds to learn and to grow in knowledge and understanding.
[3485.88 --> 3488.22]  And to develop the gifts that you have given us.
[3489.30 --> 3494.92]  Lord, we can be stressed by new and ongoing challenges in our finances and business and work.
[3495.68 --> 3500.56]  Help us trust in you alone as the source and provider of everything we need.
[3500.56 --> 3504.52]  Lord, we confess that we don't always put our whole trust in you.
[3504.96 --> 3510.32]  And that we find it difficult to let go of the false hope that we can place in self-sufficiency.
[3511.66 --> 3514.94]  Help us offer up our first fruits to you.
[3515.44 --> 3517.20]  And to seek first your kingdom.
[3517.62 --> 3521.40]  Knowing full well that where our treasure is, there our hearts will be also.
[3523.26 --> 3525.40]  Lord, we feel hopeless at times.
[3525.40 --> 3529.30]  As the world faces turmoils of ongoing wars and unrest.
[3529.30 --> 3535.46]  We particularly think of Ukraine and Haiti and so many other places currently in turmoil.
[3536.32 --> 3539.48]  Lord, please end the conflicts, the hatred, and the wars.
[3540.10 --> 3544.74]  And bring political peace through the true shalom peace that only you can give.
[3546.30 --> 3550.66]  Lord, we pray for each one in our congregation who's experiencing specific needs.
[3550.96 --> 3552.66]  Either publicly or some privately.
[3553.70 --> 3555.32]  Lord, we pray for John Philpott.
[3555.48 --> 3558.30]  And thank you for a successful surgery that he had this Friday.
[3558.30 --> 3560.78]  We ask, Lord, for full healing for John.
[3561.00 --> 3563.90]  And that the physiotherapy that he has now will be effective.
[3564.88 --> 3570.08]  And Lord, we lift up Trudy DeVries as she goes in on Friday for a surgery for a carotid artery.
[3570.72 --> 3571.86]  Lord, we pray for the surgeons.
[3572.06 --> 3574.80]  That you bless them with skilled hands to do their work.
[3575.14 --> 3578.50]  And that you would heal her body and help her to fully recover quickly.
[3580.04 --> 3583.90]  And Lord, we pray for each of the many visitors that have been worshipping with us.
[3583.90 --> 3585.62]  And sharing in our community with us.
[3586.18 --> 3588.02]  Help us be a support to one another.
[3588.50 --> 3593.38]  To extend the love of Christ through the body of which each and every one of us is an important part.
[3594.40 --> 3600.92]  We praise you, Lord, as this morning we could welcome Nico, Denise, Austin, Levi, Karis, and Isla to the Langley Emanuel Church family.
[3601.60 --> 3604.90]  Help us grow together in the faith and knowledge of you.
[3604.90 --> 3610.22]  And Lord, we pray for our pastors and leaders and volunteers and staff of this church.
[3610.64 --> 3614.36]  We ask that you give them what they stand in need of to do your work.
[3614.90 --> 3620.50]  Ministering to our congregation and leading us all to minister to our neighborhood and the world around us.
[3621.24 --> 3622.34]  Lord, we pray for Sylvia.
[3622.52 --> 3627.24]  And we thank you for blessing her and our congregation with the many years of her work for us.
[3627.60 --> 3630.70]  And we pray, Lord, that you bless her in the next steps of her journey.
[3630.70 --> 3636.60]  And Lord, we pray for each of us as we prepare for Lord's Supper next week.
[3636.96 --> 3640.64]  That you would prepare our hearts and help us come hungry to be fed.
[3641.80 --> 3647.82]  And Lord, as we hear your Advent message today, please bless Pastor Kevin as he brings us your word.
[3648.54 --> 3657.02]  Work in our hearts and help us leave here today with a renewed hope and direction in our Advent waiting to celebrate the Christ child once again this Christmas.
[3657.02 --> 3665.94]  Lord, we ask that we live our lives in Advent waiting for your second coming and the final restoration and renewal of all things to you.
[3667.06 --> 3674.54]  Lord, we lift up and pray all these things in the beautiful, wonderful, powerful name of Jesus Christ, our Savior and Lord.
[3675.12 --> 3675.38]  Amen.
[3687.02 --> 3687.42]  Amen.
[3695.58 --> 3697.14]  Good morning, everyone.
[3698.52 --> 3699.22]  That's nice.
[3699.34 --> 3699.74]  That's nice.
[3699.82 --> 3700.18]  That was good.
[3700.66 --> 3702.62]  That's usually a little bit quieter than that when I get up here.
[3702.62 --> 3703.56]  It's been quite a Sunday.
[3703.70 --> 3708.80]  We've had Advent readings and new members welcomed and Kids Corner happening and a video on Mexico.
[3709.14 --> 3711.06]  And there's a lot going on these days.
[3711.12 --> 3716.44]  And it's really nice to be with you and gathered together on this second Sunday of Advent.
[3717.02 --> 3728.36]  Now, during this Advent season, Pastor Chris mostly, but then I today, will be walking you through passages in the book of Revelation as we discuss what it means to wait for our King.
[3728.36 --> 3736.54]  Now, the goal of this sermon series throughout Advent is to highlight that we're living in anticipation of the return of the King,
[3736.62 --> 3743.74]  who invites us to be a people of patient endurance and faith, who can live rejoicing in the world to come,
[3744.36 --> 3749.20]  and live with joy in the world that is, holding to the love that holds on to us,
[3750.44 --> 3754.90]  living it boldly, and longing for the day when all will be made whole.
[3754.90 --> 3762.64]  So last week, Pastor Chris led us through Revelation 3, 1-10, where we heard about how we are to be people of patient endurance and faith.
[3762.72 --> 3766.90]  And today, we will look at the underlined bit on the screen behind me.
[3767.32 --> 3772.78]  How we can live rejoicing in the world to come, and in the world that is.
[3773.44 --> 3776.06]  The last week was faith, this week is joy.
[3776.06 --> 3781.78]  Now, for this, we're going to look at Revelation, and we're going to look at a three-fold hallelujah chorus,
[3782.14 --> 3784.92]  found in Revelation 19, verses 1-9.
[3785.06 --> 3791.80]  If you've got your Bibles, and I hope you do, even apps on your phone, or there's some Bibles in the back you can grab as well,
[3792.16 --> 3795.32]  we're going to turn to that now, Revelation 19, 1-9.
[3795.52 --> 3798.82]  Please have those Bibles ready, because we're going to be going all over Revelation today,
[3798.90 --> 3800.66]  so it'll be handy to have those in front of you.
[3800.66 --> 3806.56]  So, Revelation 19, 1-9, it says this.
[3807.66 --> 3813.08]  After this, I heard what sounded like the roar of a great multitude in heaven, shouting,
[3813.52 --> 3820.28]  Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God, for true and just are His judgments.
[3821.00 --> 3825.74]  He has condemned the great prostitute who corrupted the earth by her adulteries.
[3826.30 --> 3829.32]  He has avenged on her the blood of His servants.
[3829.32 --> 3835.04]  And again they shouted, Hallelujah! The smoke and the fire from her goes up forever and ever.
[3836.42 --> 3840.60]  The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God,
[3840.68 --> 3844.78]  who was seated on the throne, and they cried out, Amen! Hallelujah!
[3846.46 --> 3855.46]  Then a voice came from the throne, saying, Praise our God, all you servants, you who fear Him, both great and small.
[3855.46 --> 3861.28]  Then I heard what sounded like a great multitude, like the roar of rushing waters,
[3861.40 --> 3866.66]  and like peals of thunder, shouting, Hallelujah! For the Lord God Almighty reigns!
[3866.76 --> 3869.54]  Let us rejoice and be glad and give Him glory!
[3869.78 --> 3873.76]  For the wedding of the Lamb has come, and His bride has made herself ready.
[3874.28 --> 3877.92]  Fine linen, bright and clean, was given her to wear.
[3878.46 --> 3881.96]  Fine linen stands for the righteous acts of God's holy people.
[3881.96 --> 3890.46]  Then the angel said to me, Write this, Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb.
[3891.12 --> 3894.66]  And he added, These are the true words of God.
[3895.86 --> 3897.00]  The word of the Lord.
[3900.62 --> 3905.04]  Now, you'll notice immediately at the start of our text this morning, we read,
[3905.18 --> 3906.30]  After this I heard.
[3907.06 --> 3909.32]  Which means, of course, we have to ask the question,
[3909.90 --> 3910.36]  Heard what?
[3910.36 --> 3912.98]  After what?
[3913.06 --> 3914.84]  What happened before this passage?
[3914.98 --> 3917.20]  Well, chapters 17 and 18 do silly,
[3917.46 --> 3919.84]  and a whole lot of stuff goes on in those two chapters,
[3920.04 --> 3923.04]  all of which has to do with God's judgment.
[3923.64 --> 3924.88]  So let's take a quick look.
[3925.10 --> 3927.30]  We won't read all of chapters 17 and 18,
[3927.42 --> 3928.70]  but please have it in front of you,
[3928.98 --> 3931.20]  and read it as I kind of yammer on here for a bit.
[3931.30 --> 3932.52]  Please have those Bibles handy.
[3933.12 --> 3934.84]  Here's what goes down in those two chapters.
[3934.84 --> 3937.24]  We are introduced to two characters,
[3937.46 --> 3940.52]  a woman and a beast with which she rides on.
[3941.36 --> 3944.58]  The woman is described as the mother of all prostitutes
[3944.58 --> 3947.16]  and of all the abominations of the earth.
[3947.82 --> 3952.68]  She is drunk on wine made out of the blood of God's holy people,
[3952.68 --> 3956.36]  and in her cup is filled with all of the filth
[3956.36 --> 3960.02]  and abominable things of her adulteries.
[3960.64 --> 3965.54]  In other words, this is an evil, disgusting, reprehensible figure
[3965.54 --> 3970.60]  who is later told to represent the great city of worldly things,
[3971.24 --> 3973.16]  meaning Babylon or Rome,
[3973.58 --> 3975.74]  or if you want to start applying this today,
[3975.74 --> 3977.80]  our worldly cultures of the day.
[3977.80 --> 3982.36]  The beast is described as scarlet in color,
[3983.12 --> 3984.94]  covered in blasphemous names,
[3985.44 --> 3990.24]  and who is out to consume the woman who rides it.
[3991.90 --> 3993.68]  Now some of you might be hearing this and thinking,
[3993.78 --> 3994.76]  this sounds familiar.
[3996.02 --> 3999.10]  Well remember, Revelation as a book has a lot of parodies.
[3999.26 --> 4002.32]  There's a lot of stories that come back and repeat themselves,
[4002.52 --> 4004.00]  and this happens to be one of them.
[4004.48 --> 4007.00]  Last week, Pastor Chris talked about a woman and a beast
[4007.00 --> 4008.56]  described in Revelation 12,
[4009.52 --> 4011.08]  so seven chapters earlier.
[4011.66 --> 4014.20]  Now that woman, though, she was pure in heart.
[4015.06 --> 4017.98]  She was pregnant with a child that would rule the nations.
[4018.40 --> 4020.72]  Now this child, who we know is Jesus,
[4021.20 --> 4023.06]  was what the beast wanted to consume,
[4023.18 --> 4025.44]  wanted to eat it for lunch and wanted to consume it forever.
[4025.44 --> 4029.44]  But God spared both the woman and the child.
[4030.60 --> 4032.50]  So that's the story of Revelation 12,
[4033.34 --> 4035.28]  and about the woman and the beast we find there.
[4035.28 --> 4037.84]  But here, in Revelation 19,
[4037.84 --> 4040.02]  we have another woman and beast.
[4040.38 --> 4042.84]  It's two stories about two women and a beast
[4042.84 --> 4044.82]  waiting to consume them both.
[4046.26 --> 4048.94]  The woman in Revelation 12 was spared.
[4050.26 --> 4051.80]  And the woman in Revelation 12
[4051.80 --> 4053.38]  was the mother of God
[4053.38 --> 4055.14]  and the mother of the church.
[4056.80 --> 4059.12]  In Revelation 17 and 18, though,
[4059.26 --> 4060.24]  it's a different tale.
[4060.32 --> 4061.12]  It's a different woman.
[4061.12 --> 4064.20]  This woman is also hated by the beast.
[4065.08 --> 4066.46]  But she's not of God.
[4067.34 --> 4068.64]  She's of this world.
[4069.72 --> 4071.62]  She's the mother of immorality,
[4071.74 --> 4074.78]  the prostitute who's drunk on the blood of God's holy people.
[4074.88 --> 4075.54]  She is corrupt.
[4075.90 --> 4076.52]  She's evil.
[4076.78 --> 4077.36]  She is wicked.
[4077.76 --> 4079.98]  And as we read in Revelation 17 and 18,
[4080.58 --> 4082.70]  she is not spared by God.
[4083.62 --> 4086.92]  The beast devours her and burns her with fire.
[4086.92 --> 4088.22]  And when that happens,
[4088.36 --> 4090.28]  the world who loved this woman,
[4091.22 --> 4093.96]  the world who loved this evil, wretched woman,
[4094.26 --> 4096.20]  watches her get destroyed
[4096.20 --> 4098.54]  and shouts out in agony.
[4098.74 --> 4101.38]  Read the cries in Revelation 18 here.
[4101.44 --> 4101.68]  It says,
[4101.86 --> 4102.10]  Woe!
[4102.22 --> 4103.58]  Woe to you, great city!
[4103.66 --> 4104.70]  Dressed in fine linen,
[4105.04 --> 4105.88]  purple and scarlet,
[4105.96 --> 4106.92]  and glittering with gold,
[4107.24 --> 4108.52]  precious stones and pearls.
[4109.00 --> 4109.38]  Woe!
[4109.56 --> 4111.18]  Woe to you, great city!
[4111.18 --> 4115.10]  Where all who had ships on the sea became rich through her wealth.
[4115.50 --> 4116.52]  In one hour,
[4117.02 --> 4118.46]  she has been brought to ruin.
[4120.66 --> 4122.46]  And then we get to our text.
[4124.08 --> 4128.42]  This woman and the beasts have been defeated.
[4129.24 --> 4130.60]  And now there's this celebration.
[4131.78 --> 4133.98]  Justice reigns and victory is won.
[4134.26 --> 4139.14]  And our text is this resounding gong of celebration and cheer.
[4139.14 --> 4141.52]  For victorious hallelujahs reign out.
[4141.84 --> 4144.56]  For all of those who are under the thumb of this woman.
[4146.02 --> 4150.14]  And under the thumb of this beast who is seeking to consume all things.
[4151.54 --> 4152.62]  In the end,
[4153.70 --> 4156.34]  justice reigns and victory is won.
[4156.46 --> 4159.24]  And we will live rejoicing in the world to come.
[4159.48 --> 4163.16]  And can continue to live with joy in the world that is.
[4163.36 --> 4166.68]  Because of that victory that we read about in our text.
[4166.80 --> 4168.54]  So let's take a closer look at that right now.
[4169.14 --> 4172.06]  Now our text is broken down into three chunks.
[4172.64 --> 4174.92]  The first is verses 1 to 3.
[4175.02 --> 4178.58]  Where there's this big contrast that's worth digging into a bit.
[4179.22 --> 4182.66]  And that's the contrast between celebration and judgment.
[4183.96 --> 4185.94]  Now in our world, we love celebration.
[4186.16 --> 4186.26]  Right?
[4186.34 --> 4187.06]  Celebration is fun.
[4187.16 --> 4187.78]  We love to win.
[4187.90 --> 4188.60]  We love to cheer.
[4188.70 --> 4189.40]  We love to rejoice.
[4189.66 --> 4190.56]  Who doesn't love a party?
[4190.64 --> 4192.04]  Who doesn't love a great celebration?
[4193.66 --> 4194.56]  Judgment though?
[4195.26 --> 4196.24]  Not as big a fan.
[4196.24 --> 4197.62]  We're not as big a fan of judgment.
[4197.86 --> 4199.46]  It's frowned upon in our world.
[4199.52 --> 4200.36]  Don't judge people.
[4200.86 --> 4202.26]  We always say it's bad to judge.
[4202.68 --> 4203.60]  You think you're better than me?
[4203.64 --> 4204.46]  How dare you think that?
[4204.50 --> 4205.38]  You think you're better than them?
[4205.42 --> 4206.42]  How dare you say that?
[4207.86 --> 4209.08]  But here in our text,
[4209.40 --> 4212.38]  and hopefully we'll come to see that this is true in our world as well,
[4212.44 --> 4214.70]  we can't have one without the other.
[4214.70 --> 4219.30]  See, during Advent, we're waiting for our King, right?
[4219.40 --> 4222.78]  We celebrate His initial coming at Christmas, of course,
[4222.88 --> 4226.44]  and as our baby in the manger, the Savior born in Bethlehem,
[4226.50 --> 4230.24]  who defeated sin and death for us all with His sacrifice on the cross
[4230.24 --> 4232.36]  and His resurrection from the grave.
[4232.40 --> 4235.92]  And we celebrate Him coming down on Christmas for us.
[4236.06 --> 4237.02]  No more anxiety.
[4237.18 --> 4237.92]  No more grief.
[4238.20 --> 4239.50]  No more pain or suffering.
[4240.08 --> 4244.08]  Everything from depression will go away when He comes back.
[4244.70 --> 4246.52]  Because our King didn't just come once.
[4246.58 --> 4247.44]  He's coming again.
[4248.40 --> 4250.92]  And we're waiting for that eternal celebration
[4250.92 --> 4254.28]  that we will have as the new heaven comes down
[4254.28 --> 4256.70]  and Jesus reigns once and for all.
[4258.46 --> 4262.06]  Everything from depression to cancer to back pain will be gone,
[4262.26 --> 4264.66]  and it will not be at the expense of this earth
[4264.66 --> 4266.02]  and the things that we enjoy,
[4266.02 --> 4268.88]  but it will be in the renewing of this earth,
[4268.96 --> 4270.46]  the renewing of the world,
[4270.68 --> 4273.88]  and the glorification of God who created all of it.
[4273.88 --> 4276.16]  And then we will dance and we will sing
[4276.16 --> 4277.46]  and we will play and we will laugh
[4277.46 --> 4279.84]  and we will reign with Jesus over all of it
[4279.84 --> 4281.92]  because we are co-heirs with Christ
[4281.92 --> 4284.50]  because of His life, death, and resurrection.
[4284.94 --> 4286.36]  That's what we wait for.
[4286.64 --> 4289.10]  That's the celebration that we will join in
[4289.10 --> 4292.16]  that our threefold hallelujah text of today
[4292.16 --> 4293.48]  points us towards.
[4296.26 --> 4297.38]  But here's the rub.
[4297.38 --> 4303.84]  This celebration happens because of judgment.
[4305.84 --> 4308.14]  It comes when Jesus returns
[4308.14 --> 4310.84]  and destroys all evil,
[4311.70 --> 4313.10]  destroys corruption,
[4313.34 --> 4315.88]  destroys the sinful nature of the beast
[4315.88 --> 4317.12]  and the woman of the city.
[4317.56 --> 4318.72]  Celebration is coming,
[4319.12 --> 4320.78]  but only when judgment happens.
[4320.78 --> 4324.74]  When the followers of Christ
[4324.74 --> 4326.52]  hear the sounds of victory,
[4327.52 --> 4329.24]  the friends of the beast
[4329.24 --> 4330.82]  or the followers of the woman
[4330.82 --> 4333.98]  will hear the sounds of doom and darkness.
[4336.86 --> 4338.52]  They will feel destruction.
[4340.88 --> 4343.04]  Celebration will start with judgment.
[4343.98 --> 4346.86]  And our text is actually celebrating that time
[4346.86 --> 4348.20]  when judgment comes,
[4348.32 --> 4349.74]  when justice is delivered.
[4349.74 --> 4351.22]  In verse 2 and 3 of our text,
[4351.48 --> 4353.34]  it's the judgment that is celebrated.
[4353.64 --> 4354.42]  Listen to the words.
[4354.94 --> 4357.00]  He has condemned the great prostitute
[4357.00 --> 4359.50]  who corrupted the earth by her adulteries.
[4359.82 --> 4363.68]  He has avenged on her the blood of His servants.
[4364.00 --> 4365.24]  And again, they shouted,
[4365.60 --> 4366.00]  Hallelujah!
[4367.28 --> 4371.36]  The smoke from her goes up forever and ever.
[4372.48 --> 4373.60]  That's not pretty.
[4375.70 --> 4377.22]  But it's what we will celebrate.
[4377.22 --> 4381.20]  When we look ahead to the everlasting joy found in heaven,
[4381.48 --> 4384.02]  an eternity without depression or cancer or back pain,
[4384.28 --> 4386.36]  that comes at the feet of judgment.
[4387.72 --> 4390.80]  The judgment of unrepentant murder and abuse
[4390.80 --> 4392.88]  and human trafficking and gossip.
[4393.06 --> 4395.20]  Our world despises judgment.
[4395.94 --> 4397.90]  It calls for tolerance and approval,
[4398.36 --> 4400.78]  but tolerance and approval won't do.
[4400.78 --> 4405.46]  There's a difference between sins that we repent of, of course,
[4406.26 --> 4409.12]  and sins that permeate the culture with which we live in.
[4410.22 --> 4412.96]  We cannot be ignorant and think that the beast
[4412.96 --> 4415.80]  is not out there devouring people in this world.
[4416.28 --> 4418.64]  Yes, the beast has been bound.
[4420.12 --> 4421.26]  Christ has won.
[4421.26 --> 4426.42]  But a bound or a trapped animal is often the most dangerous.
[4428.08 --> 4429.58]  See, we know Christ has won,
[4429.66 --> 4430.74]  and we know He was coming,
[4430.82 --> 4431.28]  and we wait.
[4431.60 --> 4433.34]  Oh, do we wait for Him to come again,
[4433.46 --> 4435.54]  to rid the world once and for all of the sin
[4435.54 --> 4437.36]  that so easily entangles us,
[4437.46 --> 4440.02]  to rid the world of pain and of anxiety
[4440.02 --> 4442.04]  and of suffering and of grief,
[4442.14 --> 4443.74]  where the blind will see
[4443.74 --> 4445.26]  and the lame will walk,
[4445.42 --> 4446.92]  where the widow will find a husband,
[4447.48 --> 4449.30]  where the orphan will find a father.
[4449.30 --> 4453.08]  And we will celebrate that,
[4453.36 --> 4455.42]  because victory is coming.
[4456.30 --> 4457.16]  Because when He comes,
[4457.24 --> 4459.28]  He will bring us the love and hope
[4459.28 --> 4460.76]  and peace and joy
[4460.76 --> 4463.04]  that we wait for during this Advent season.
[4465.00 --> 4466.96]  But that victory is coming.
[4468.14 --> 4469.94]  It's coming because of judgment.
[4470.74 --> 4471.56]  It has to.
[4472.20 --> 4473.66]  And we will celebrate that judgment,
[4473.84 --> 4475.76]  because things happen here on earth
[4475.76 --> 4477.96]  that are not just.
[4479.30 --> 4481.12]  Sins that go unnoticed
[4481.12 --> 4482.56]  and unrepented.
[4483.02 --> 4484.82]  Suffering that is unseen.
[4485.28 --> 4486.72]  Abuse that no one notices.
[4488.06 --> 4491.48]  Torment that people experience in isolation.
[4493.26 --> 4494.92]  And these things go on and on,
[4495.04 --> 4495.86]  seemingly forever,
[4495.98 --> 4496.82]  with no respite.
[4497.00 --> 4498.30]  But when Christ comes again,
[4498.64 --> 4499.64]  there will be judgment
[4499.64 --> 4502.32]  for all of those things.
[4502.32 --> 4505.82]  We cannot sit and think
[4505.82 --> 4506.66]  that eternal judgment
[4506.66 --> 4507.72]  will not lead us
[4507.72 --> 4510.18]  to our everlasting joy.
[4510.26 --> 4511.24]  They go hand in hand.
[4512.62 --> 4514.48]  Because as verse 1 of our text
[4514.48 --> 4515.06]  points out,
[4515.20 --> 4516.78]  salvation, glory,
[4517.22 --> 4519.20]  and power belong to God.
[4521.30 --> 4522.64]  We sing this all the time,
[4522.70 --> 4523.32]  and it's magnificent,
[4524.08 --> 4525.00]  and the truth of that
[4525.00 --> 4526.16]  rings in our hearts.
[4526.54 --> 4527.58]  Salvation is ours
[4527.58 --> 4528.82]  because it belongs to God.
[4529.64 --> 4530.98]  Christ came to this earth,
[4531.16 --> 4532.88]  and He lived this perfect life
[4532.88 --> 4533.66]  that we have been called
[4533.66 --> 4534.52]  yet failed to live.
[4534.72 --> 4535.86]  And then He died a death
[4535.86 --> 4536.86]  on the cross
[4536.86 --> 4538.26]  for all of our sin
[4538.26 --> 4539.36]  in our place.
[4539.48 --> 4540.86]  A death that we all deserved.
[4542.12 --> 4543.22]  And He took the sins
[4543.22 --> 4544.90]  and the brokenness of this world
[4544.90 --> 4545.60]  on His shoulders
[4545.60 --> 4546.84]  into the grave with Him.
[4547.92 --> 4548.86]  But on the third day,
[4548.96 --> 4550.66]  He rose again from the dead,
[4550.74 --> 4551.88]  and He defeated sin
[4551.88 --> 4553.40]  and misery and death
[4553.40 --> 4554.60]  and saved us all
[4554.60 --> 4555.82]  because salvation belongs
[4555.82 --> 4557.54]  to our God,
[4557.64 --> 4558.84]  and we are saved.
[4559.86 --> 4561.64]  We are saved from the sins,
[4562.20 --> 4562.94]  and when we repent,
[4563.06 --> 4564.46]  we get a clean slate from God.
[4565.20 --> 4565.86]  And we are saved
[4565.86 --> 4566.96]  from the misery of this world
[4566.96 --> 4567.66]  because we know
[4567.66 --> 4568.74]  that our Savior lives,
[4569.00 --> 4570.30]  and He is always with us.
[4570.98 --> 4572.12]  And we are saved
[4572.12 --> 4573.96]  from death consuming us
[4573.96 --> 4575.78]  for all of eternity.
[4576.24 --> 4576.82]  But church,
[4577.20 --> 4578.56]  that is only half
[4578.56 --> 4579.98]  of the good news.
[4581.40 --> 4582.24]  You see, so often
[4582.24 --> 4583.40]  we talk about salvation.
[4583.40 --> 4584.82]  we talk about
[4584.82 --> 4586.00]  what we are saved
[4586.00 --> 4586.88]  or delivered from.
[4587.52 --> 4588.06]  We talk about
[4588.06 --> 4588.58]  how we are saved
[4588.58 --> 4589.22]  from death,
[4589.36 --> 4590.18]  saved from sin,
[4590.46 --> 4591.38]  saved from misery.
[4593.28 --> 4594.74]  But we are saved
[4594.74 --> 4595.52]  to someone.
[4595.94 --> 4596.48]  We are not just
[4596.48 --> 4597.62]  delivered from sin.
[4597.78 --> 4598.40]  We are delivered
[4598.40 --> 4599.46]  to something.
[4599.90 --> 4600.94]  We are delivered
[4600.94 --> 4601.76]  to righteousness,
[4602.00 --> 4603.22]  to an eternal feast
[4603.22 --> 4603.70]  of the Lamb.
[4603.76 --> 4604.42]  We are saved
[4604.42 --> 4605.02]  and delivered
[4605.02 --> 4606.48]  to an eternal joy.
[4606.60 --> 4607.28]  We are saved
[4607.28 --> 4608.30]  to our God,
[4608.38 --> 4609.18]  and we can live
[4609.18 --> 4610.02]  and rejoice
[4610.02 --> 4610.68]  in the world
[4610.68 --> 4612.18]  that is to come
[4612.18 --> 4613.02]  in the future.
[4613.40 --> 4616.22]  And also because
[4616.22 --> 4616.98]  of how the drama
[4616.98 --> 4618.14]  of Scripture ends,
[4618.62 --> 4620.02]  we can live with joy
[4620.02 --> 4620.90]  in the world
[4620.90 --> 4622.82]  that is now as well.
[4623.74 --> 4624.60]  I want you to hold
[4624.60 --> 4625.04]  on to that
[4625.04 --> 4625.80]  for just a little bit.
[4625.86 --> 4626.58]  We'll get back to that.
[4630.40 --> 4631.28]  The next chunk
[4631.28 --> 4633.68]  gets to how the story
[4633.68 --> 4634.48]  actually ends.
[4634.86 --> 4636.34]  Verses 4 to 6 tell us.
[4636.40 --> 4638.22]  It's a celebratory end
[4638.22 --> 4639.32]  which is preparing us
[4639.32 --> 4640.16]  for the new Jerusalem
[4640.16 --> 4641.10]  that is coming
[4641.10 --> 4641.70]  with the return
[4641.70 --> 4642.20]  of the King.
[4642.20 --> 4643.46]  Now there will be
[4643.46 --> 4644.04]  a new heaven
[4644.04 --> 4644.80]  and a new earth
[4644.80 --> 4645.30]  and we will be
[4645.30 --> 4646.62]  a part of that forever.
[4646.78 --> 4648.22]  So how do we prepare
[4648.22 --> 4650.28]  for this new earth,
[4650.36 --> 4651.48]  for this new Jerusalem?
[4652.90 --> 4653.80]  Our calling
[4653.80 --> 4655.08]  while we prepare
[4655.08 --> 4655.88]  for that day
[4655.88 --> 4657.18]  is to worship.
[4658.32 --> 4659.12]  Now look at verse 4
[4659.12 --> 4659.64]  for a second.
[4660.78 --> 4661.56]  Notice how it talks
[4661.56 --> 4663.12]  about these 24 elders
[4663.12 --> 4664.62]  and 4 living creatures.
[4664.78 --> 4665.70]  Now that may,
[4665.88 --> 4666.40]  when we read
[4666.40 --> 4667.12]  this chapter
[4667.12 --> 4667.74]  in isolation,
[4667.96 --> 4668.68]  seems like it comes
[4668.68 --> 4669.16]  out of nowhere.
[4669.16 --> 4670.92]  but these are actually
[4670.92 --> 4672.52]  very key character gods
[4672.52 --> 4673.52]  who represent
[4673.52 --> 4674.62]  the heavenly council
[4674.62 --> 4676.06]  submitting to the rule
[4676.06 --> 4676.68]  and the authority
[4676.68 --> 4677.22]  of Christ.
[4677.64 --> 4678.22]  And this book
[4678.22 --> 4678.82]  of Revelation
[4678.82 --> 4680.02]  has mentioned them before.
[4680.92 --> 4682.00]  So these 24 elders
[4682.00 --> 4682.78]  and 4 creatures,
[4682.94 --> 4684.88]  they appear in Revelation 4,
[4685.24 --> 4685.84]  verse 4.
[4686.02 --> 4687.24]  Now this is way back
[4687.24 --> 4688.10]  to the start
[4688.10 --> 4689.58]  of John's vision here.
[4690.36 --> 4690.84]  If you know
[4690.84 --> 4691.42]  the breakup
[4691.42 --> 4692.12]  or the breakdown
[4692.12 --> 4692.84]  of Revelation,
[4693.26 --> 4694.08]  you'll know chapter 1
[4694.08 --> 4695.10]  is sort of an introduction
[4695.10 --> 4695.98]  to what this church
[4695.98 --> 4696.62]  is going to be,
[4696.90 --> 4697.54]  or what this church,
[4697.64 --> 4698.08]  what this book
[4698.08 --> 4698.82]  is going to be about.
[4699.02 --> 4700.24]  And then chapters 2 and 3
[4700.24 --> 4701.24]  are 7 letters
[4701.24 --> 4703.34]  written to the 7 churches
[4703.34 --> 4704.66]  in Asia Minor.
[4705.80 --> 4706.66]  And then the rest
[4706.66 --> 4707.04]  of the book
[4707.04 --> 4707.80]  is John's vision.
[4708.64 --> 4709.80]  Chapter 4 and on.
[4712.24 --> 4713.48]  And chapter 4
[4713.48 --> 4714.16]  of Revelation
[4714.16 --> 4715.04]  starts with these
[4715.04 --> 4715.88]  24 elders.
[4716.38 --> 4717.02]  And what are those
[4717.02 --> 4718.02]  24 elders doing
[4718.02 --> 4718.58]  in Revelation,
[4718.72 --> 4719.24]  you may ask?
[4720.20 --> 4721.62]  They are worshiping God.
[4723.12 --> 4724.00]  This whole vision
[4724.00 --> 4725.00]  of John in Revelation
[4725.00 --> 4726.12]  started with these
[4726.12 --> 4727.06]  24 elders
[4727.06 --> 4728.80]  worshiping God.
[4729.30 --> 4730.04]  And then in the middle
[4730.04 --> 4731.18]  of this vision,
[4731.84 --> 4732.54]  skip ahead to
[4732.54 --> 4733.86]  Revelation 11, 16.
[4734.00 --> 4734.90]  Guess who shows up again?
[4735.64 --> 4736.72]  The 24 elders.
[4737.62 --> 4738.56]  And what are they doing?
[4739.48 --> 4741.04]  They're worshiping God.
[4741.32 --> 4742.00]  You can check it out.
[4742.66 --> 4744.02]  Revelation 4, verse 4.
[4744.40 --> 4745.70]  Revelation 11, 16.
[4746.08 --> 4746.90]  And then at the end
[4746.90 --> 4747.36]  of the vision,
[4747.44 --> 4748.20]  in our text today,
[4748.32 --> 4749.98]  Revelation 19, 4.
[4750.72 --> 4751.94]  There's 24 elders
[4751.94 --> 4752.96]  worshiping God.
[4752.96 --> 4755.70]  24 elders at the start
[4755.70 --> 4756.30]  of the vision,
[4756.38 --> 4757.24]  in the middle of the vision,
[4757.30 --> 4758.16]  at the final judgment,
[4758.34 --> 4759.74]  all worshiping God,
[4759.82 --> 4760.62]  all celebrating
[4760.62 --> 4761.78]  what He has done.
[4762.26 --> 4762.78]  John's vision
[4762.78 --> 4763.78]  starts with worship,
[4764.24 --> 4765.34]  proceeds with worship,
[4765.52 --> 4767.14]  and culminates in worship.
[4767.38 --> 4768.28]  From worship
[4768.28 --> 4769.18]  to worship.
[4769.42 --> 4770.30]  And that is what
[4770.30 --> 4771.24]  we are called to do.
[4772.24 --> 4773.84]  Our celebratory response
[4773.84 --> 4774.72]  to divine judgment
[4774.72 --> 4775.78]  is to worship.
[4775.90 --> 4776.52]  That's what verses
[4776.52 --> 4777.76]  4 to 6 in our text
[4777.76 --> 4779.62]  talk all about.
[4779.62 --> 4781.16]  From the creation
[4781.16 --> 4781.84]  of the world
[4781.84 --> 4782.42]  to the coming
[4782.42 --> 4783.16]  new Jerusalem.
[4783.82 --> 4784.76]  From angels
[4784.76 --> 4786.36]  calling shepherds
[4786.36 --> 4787.06]  to a manger
[4787.06 --> 4788.66]  to an angel
[4788.66 --> 4789.30]  pointing us
[4789.30 --> 4789.90]  to the return
[4789.90 --> 4790.44]  of the King.
[4791.18 --> 4792.30]  From the cradles
[4792.30 --> 4793.92]  with which we sleep in
[4793.92 --> 4794.40]  at birth
[4794.40 --> 4795.42]  to the graves
[4795.42 --> 4796.14]  that we will find
[4796.14 --> 4797.34]  ourselves in
[4797.34 --> 4798.72]  at the end of our life
[4798.72 --> 4799.28]  here on earth.
[4799.74 --> 4801.26]  We are called
[4801.26 --> 4802.88]  to worship our Lord.
[4804.64 --> 4805.68]  And then finally,
[4805.78 --> 4806.18]  as we see
[4806.18 --> 4807.30]  in the final three verses,
[4808.52 --> 4809.30]  the celebration
[4809.30 --> 4810.28]  the worship
[4810.28 --> 4810.98]  that we are called
[4810.98 --> 4811.46]  to give,
[4811.58 --> 4812.46]  it concludes
[4812.46 --> 4814.18]  with a wedding feast.
[4814.78 --> 4815.84]  Revelation 19,
[4816.28 --> 4817.02]  7 to 9,
[4817.08 --> 4817.92]  the final three verses
[4817.92 --> 4818.60]  of our text.
[4819.16 --> 4820.02]  It's described,
[4820.16 --> 4821.06]  this place is described
[4821.06 --> 4821.60]  as a place
[4821.60 --> 4822.78]  full of glory
[4822.78 --> 4824.52]  and full of great rejoicing.
[4825.86 --> 4826.36]  See, we've been
[4826.36 --> 4827.98]  given righteous acts
[4827.98 --> 4829.10]  to fulfill in this world
[4829.10 --> 4829.62]  and when Christ
[4829.62 --> 4830.20]  looks on us,
[4830.24 --> 4831.28]  He sees His people.
[4831.76 --> 4832.70]  He sees His church,
[4832.78 --> 4833.42]  His bride,
[4833.78 --> 4835.34]  bright and clean
[4835.34 --> 4836.38]  as if wearing
[4836.38 --> 4837.18]  fine linen.
[4837.18 --> 4839.24]  This is a party,
[4839.38 --> 4840.26]  a celebration.
[4840.46 --> 4841.32]  It's envisioned
[4841.32 --> 4842.26]  as a place
[4842.26 --> 4843.46]  of such great
[4843.46 --> 4844.36]  eschatological
[4844.36 --> 4846.68]  or eternal joy.
[4848.84 --> 4849.86]  Now interestingly,
[4850.06 --> 4851.16]  according to this text,
[4851.62 --> 4852.52]  we, the church,
[4852.92 --> 4854.44]  are both Christ's bride
[4854.44 --> 4856.08]  at the wedding
[4856.08 --> 4857.56]  but also His guests
[4857.56 --> 4859.56]  at this beautiful banquet.
[4859.70 --> 4861.16]  See, John's mixing metaphors
[4861.16 --> 4862.46]  to bring up a point.
[4862.46 --> 4863.58]  He's undergirding
[4863.58 --> 4865.04]  the importance of joy
[4865.04 --> 4865.92]  that results
[4865.92 --> 4867.28]  from the witnessing mission
[4867.28 --> 4868.68]  that we've undertaken
[4868.68 --> 4869.88]  to proclaim Christ
[4869.88 --> 4870.68]  as Lord.
[4870.86 --> 4871.90]  Brian K. Blunt,
[4871.94 --> 4872.68]  he points that out.
[4873.00 --> 4873.26]  He says,
[4873.36 --> 4874.86]  John intends to say
[4874.86 --> 4875.94]  that the people of God
[4875.94 --> 4876.38]  have,
[4876.48 --> 4877.64]  by their acts of witnessing
[4877.64 --> 4878.98]  to the Lordship of God
[4878.98 --> 4880.06]  and the Lamb,
[4880.48 --> 4881.78]  under perilous circumstances,
[4882.44 --> 4883.12]  achieved both
[4883.12 --> 4884.50]  the conquest of the dragon
[4884.50 --> 4886.36]  and its forces
[4886.36 --> 4888.48]  as well as the victory
[4888.48 --> 4889.38]  of eschatological
[4889.38 --> 4890.68]  relationship with God.
[4890.68 --> 4891.86]  Christ has come.
[4892.74 --> 4893.88]  Christ will come again.
[4894.34 --> 4895.36]  The beast is bound.
[4895.74 --> 4896.54]  Christ has won.
[4899.00 --> 4900.16]  Yet a bound beast
[4900.16 --> 4900.96]  is still dangerous
[4900.96 --> 4901.64]  as we mentioned.
[4901.96 --> 4903.02]  So we must be diligent
[4903.02 --> 4904.10]  in our witness to the world
[4904.10 --> 4905.82]  and must be diligent
[4905.82 --> 4907.24]  in our perseverance of faith.
[4908.30 --> 4909.16]  The new Jerusalem
[4909.16 --> 4910.50]  has not yet come.
[4911.36 --> 4912.88]  But it is coming, church.
[4913.00 --> 4913.72]  It is coming.
[4913.98 --> 4915.40]  And the feast will be worth it.
[4915.78 --> 4917.36]  The justice we will see,
[4917.44 --> 4918.22]  we will celebrate.
[4918.72 --> 4919.56]  Christ has won
[4919.56 --> 4921.18]  and our joy is secured.
[4923.38 --> 4925.08]  We worship the one who saves
[4925.08 --> 4926.38]  and we witness these truths
[4926.38 --> 4927.36]  to those around us
[4927.36 --> 4928.44]  with our eyes set
[4928.44 --> 4929.54]  on this joyous banquet.
[4930.38 --> 4931.18]  That's the message
[4931.18 --> 4932.98]  of this celebratory text
[4932.98 --> 4934.26]  in Revelation 9.
[4934.34 --> 4936.06]  We can live rejoicing
[4936.06 --> 4937.48]  in the world to come.
[4939.28 --> 4941.16]  What might be harder, though,
[4941.88 --> 4944.58]  is living with joy
[4944.58 --> 4946.44]  in the world that is now.
[4946.44 --> 4950.40]  How do we rejoice
[4950.40 --> 4951.06]  in the now?
[4952.46 --> 4953.56]  I think one of the reasons
[4953.56 --> 4954.14]  this might be
[4954.14 --> 4955.74]  a difficult question for us
[4955.74 --> 4957.00]  is that we often think
[4957.00 --> 4957.98]  the words happiness
[4957.98 --> 4959.28]  and joy
[4959.28 --> 4960.36]  are synonymous.
[4961.22 --> 4962.02]  But they're the same.
[4963.14 --> 4964.14]  But they're not the same.
[4965.32 --> 4966.70]  Happiness can lead to joy.
[4967.42 --> 4968.06]  And actually, joy
[4968.06 --> 4968.98]  can lead to happiness.
[4969.66 --> 4971.10]  But they're not the same word.
[4971.46 --> 4971.82]  Happiness,
[4971.98 --> 4972.54]  to be happy,
[4972.62 --> 4973.44]  is to be delighted
[4973.44 --> 4974.08]  or pleased
[4974.08 --> 4974.82]  or glad
[4974.82 --> 4976.20]  about a certain thing.
[4977.62 --> 4978.54]  Joy, though,
[4979.30 --> 4980.22]  is to enjoy
[4980.22 --> 4980.94]  the prospect
[4980.94 --> 4981.96]  of what we desire.
[4983.56 --> 4984.56]  And it can happen
[4984.56 --> 4985.56]  at any time.
[4986.80 --> 4987.24]  So happiness
[4987.24 --> 4989.24]  is an emotive response,
[4989.38 --> 4990.72]  but joy is a posture.
[4990.92 --> 4991.82]  It's an understanding
[4991.82 --> 4993.72]  of what has come
[4993.72 --> 4994.92]  or what will be coming.
[4995.96 --> 4996.72]  There's a difference there.
[4996.76 --> 4997.66]  That's why we don't sing
[4997.66 --> 4998.94]  happiness to the world
[4998.94 --> 4999.44]  at Christmas.
[4999.56 --> 5000.20]  We sing joy
[5000.20 --> 5000.82]  to the world
[5000.82 --> 5001.48]  at Christmas.
[5002.00 --> 5003.16]  Philippians 4, verse 4,
[5003.16 --> 5003.44]  says,
[5003.78 --> 5005.08]  Rejoice in the Lord always.
[5005.20 --> 5006.18]  Again, I will say it.
[5006.38 --> 5006.82]  Rejoice.
[5007.26 --> 5007.56]  It says,
[5007.62 --> 5008.10]  Be joyful,
[5008.20 --> 5008.84]  not be happy.
[5010.00 --> 5010.32]  Always.
[5010.64 --> 5011.82]  Be joyful always.
[5011.96 --> 5012.74]  Rejoice always.
[5013.10 --> 5014.20]  1 Thessalonians 5,
[5014.28 --> 5015.22]  16 to 18,
[5015.34 --> 5015.54]  says,
[5015.86 --> 5016.94]  Rejoice always.
[5018.04 --> 5018.66]  Pray continually
[5018.66 --> 5019.32]  and give thanks
[5019.32 --> 5020.10]  in all circumstances.
[5020.24 --> 5020.42]  Not,
[5020.78 --> 5021.24]  Be happy.
[5021.74 --> 5022.74]  Be happy always.
[5023.62 --> 5025.02]  Be happy in all circumstances.
[5025.22 --> 5026.00]  That's not what it says.
[5027.54 --> 5028.24]  These verses,
[5028.48 --> 5029.24]  this calling,
[5029.46 --> 5030.36]  is to rejoice
[5030.36 --> 5031.22]  or to be joyful.
[5031.58 --> 5032.38]  It's given because
[5032.38 --> 5033.58]  we can know,
[5033.70 --> 5035.64]  no matter how hard life is,
[5035.82 --> 5037.50]  that Christ is coming
[5037.50 --> 5039.64]  and His justice
[5039.64 --> 5041.76]  will reign.
[5042.46 --> 5043.86]  We can enjoy the prospect
[5043.86 --> 5044.72]  of what we desire
[5044.72 --> 5046.82]  because what we desire
[5046.82 --> 5047.98]  is Christ.
[5048.90 --> 5049.74]  What we desire
[5049.74 --> 5050.48]  is justice
[5050.48 --> 5051.36]  and hope
[5051.36 --> 5052.24]  and love.
[5053.32 --> 5054.04]  And in the midst
[5054.04 --> 5054.84]  of unhappiness,
[5055.30 --> 5056.82]  we can still possess
[5056.82 --> 5058.16]  it is wellness
[5058.16 --> 5060.34]  with my soul.
[5062.78 --> 5064.36]  Joy or rejoicing
[5064.36 --> 5065.30]  is that
[5065.30 --> 5066.70]  it is wellness
[5066.70 --> 5067.98]  in my soul.
[5070.70 --> 5072.16]  Some people in this church,
[5072.32 --> 5073.14]  some youth and leaders
[5073.14 --> 5074.16]  and many members now
[5074.16 --> 5075.96]  are joining in
[5075.96 --> 5076.80]  and participating
[5076.80 --> 5077.58]  in Dress Semper.
[5077.70 --> 5078.48]  They're wearing dresses
[5078.48 --> 5079.40]  and ties
[5079.40 --> 5080.70]  and supporting
[5080.70 --> 5082.34]  this sort of movement
[5082.34 --> 5084.04]  as well.
[5084.12 --> 5085.06]  Others are not necessarily
[5085.06 --> 5086.04]  wearing dresses and ties,
[5086.04 --> 5087.44]  but they're advocating for
[5087.44 --> 5088.78]  and on behalf of
[5088.78 --> 5089.68]  and they're praying for
[5089.68 --> 5090.30]  and they're financially
[5090.30 --> 5091.08]  supporting this.
[5091.62 --> 5093.02]  And why we are doing this,
[5093.08 --> 5093.92]  why this is happening
[5093.92 --> 5095.72]  is because human trafficking
[5095.72 --> 5096.60]  and slavery
[5096.60 --> 5098.16]  is still a rampant
[5098.16 --> 5099.58]  100 billion,
[5099.78 --> 5100.46]  that's a B,
[5100.62 --> 5102.04]  100 billion dollar
[5102.04 --> 5103.58]  industry in our world.
[5104.70 --> 5105.58]  So we as a church
[5105.58 --> 5106.40]  and members of the church,
[5106.46 --> 5107.26]  we want to stand up
[5107.26 --> 5107.68]  against that.
[5107.74 --> 5108.72]  We want to bring awareness
[5108.72 --> 5109.06]  to that.
[5109.12 --> 5110.18]  We want to fight against that
[5110.18 --> 5111.14]  and raise money for that.
[5112.34 --> 5113.84]  We want to bring to the light
[5113.84 --> 5114.80]  these injustices
[5114.80 --> 5115.46]  that are happening.
[5115.46 --> 5117.16]  Now, we are not happy
[5117.16 --> 5118.30]  about human trafficking.
[5119.34 --> 5119.88]  It would be awful.
[5120.02 --> 5120.78]  In fact, we should all
[5120.78 --> 5122.08]  be righteously angry
[5122.08 --> 5123.58]  with what is happening
[5123.58 --> 5124.70]  to people being trafficked
[5124.70 --> 5126.00]  all over the world.
[5128.88 --> 5129.94]  But while we cannot
[5129.94 --> 5131.06]  and should not be happy,
[5132.06 --> 5134.50]  our joy can still be secure
[5134.50 --> 5136.38]  knowing that justice
[5136.38 --> 5137.38]  for these people
[5137.38 --> 5138.38]  who are victimized
[5138.38 --> 5139.38]  is coming.
[5140.58 --> 5142.28]  That can bring us joy.
[5142.28 --> 5143.92]  we can pray
[5143.92 --> 5144.88]  and we can work
[5144.88 --> 5146.20]  and we can take a stand
[5146.20 --> 5146.62]  and fight
[5146.62 --> 5147.90]  and we can do our best
[5147.90 --> 5148.60]  to bring justice
[5148.60 --> 5149.72]  for these people right now
[5149.72 --> 5150.76]  here in this world.
[5150.90 --> 5151.94]  And that is happening
[5151.94 --> 5153.50]  and we can be joyful
[5153.50 --> 5154.44]  about that too.
[5155.40 --> 5156.16]  But sadly,
[5156.32 --> 5157.46]  justice in this world
[5157.46 --> 5158.76]  is just not a certainty.
[5160.44 --> 5162.26]  As long as that bound beast
[5162.26 --> 5163.56]  is still able to devour,
[5163.70 --> 5164.86]  he will do just that.
[5164.86 --> 5167.86]  And while that might
[5167.86 --> 5168.52]  make us sad
[5168.52 --> 5170.58]  or even angry,
[5171.30 --> 5172.98]  we can still rejoice
[5172.98 --> 5175.76]  because Christ's second coming
[5175.76 --> 5177.22]  is secured
[5177.22 --> 5179.04]  and justice for all,
[5179.26 --> 5180.02]  especially those
[5180.02 --> 5180.84]  who are victimized,
[5181.00 --> 5181.68]  is coming.
[5181.82 --> 5183.02]  They will be saved.
[5183.62 --> 5185.52]  And justice will reign.
[5185.86 --> 5186.78]  Joy can be found
[5186.78 --> 5187.50]  in the not yet
[5187.50 --> 5188.42]  because we know
[5188.42 --> 5190.10]  the not yet is coming.
[5191.50 --> 5193.22]  And because we know that,
[5193.22 --> 5196.48]  it is well with our soul.
[5199.44 --> 5200.60]  Justice will reign.
[5200.86 --> 5201.92]  Judgment will come.
[5202.20 --> 5203.68]  We will be delivered
[5203.68 --> 5204.44]  from the sin
[5204.44 --> 5205.28]  and the misery
[5205.28 --> 5206.24]  and the pain
[5206.24 --> 5206.92]  of this world.
[5207.06 --> 5208.36]  And we will be delivered
[5208.36 --> 5209.50]  to the one
[5209.50 --> 5210.54]  who reigns on high.
[5210.72 --> 5211.62]  We will be saved
[5211.62 --> 5212.42]  to our Savior,
[5212.86 --> 5214.54]  delivered to our King.
[5215.98 --> 5217.16]  We still witness
[5217.16 --> 5217.92]  to that fact.
[5218.20 --> 5218.96]  We still fight
[5218.96 --> 5220.16]  for justice in the now.
[5220.42 --> 5221.28]  And while we do that,
[5221.60 --> 5222.26]  we wait
[5222.26 --> 5223.94]  with bated breath
[5223.94 --> 5225.72]  for Christ to come again
[5225.72 --> 5227.00]  and deliver all
[5227.00 --> 5228.12]  from their injustices.
[5229.54 --> 5231.26]  So we can live
[5231.26 --> 5232.58]  rejoicing in the world
[5232.58 --> 5233.06]  to come.
[5234.26 --> 5236.32]  And also live with joy
[5236.32 --> 5237.94]  in the world that is.
[5238.38 --> 5241.14]  Because Christ will come.
[5242.48 --> 5245.00]  It is well with my soul.
[5245.54 --> 5245.78]  Amen?
[5245.78 --> 5245.90]  Amen?
[5246.66 --> 5247.38]  Let me pray.
[5247.48 --> 5248.04]  Amen.
[5252.26 --> 5253.80]  Heavenly Father,
[5254.80 --> 5254.90]  Heavenly Father,
[5254.90 --> 5257.20]  as we are living
[5257.20 --> 5257.90]  in the tension
[5257.90 --> 5258.64]  of a battle
[5258.64 --> 5259.18]  and a war
[5259.18 --> 5259.86]  that is won
[5259.86 --> 5261.98]  and yet is not
[5261.98 --> 5263.38]  yet finished,
[5263.94 --> 5266.34]  we pray for you
[5266.34 --> 5266.76]  to come.
[5271.26 --> 5272.42]  As we sit
[5272.42 --> 5273.80]  in this Advent season
[5273.80 --> 5275.36]  ready to celebrate
[5275.36 --> 5276.38]  your birth,
[5276.38 --> 5278.82]  Lord Jesus,
[5279.54 --> 5281.40]  we also wait
[5281.40 --> 5282.44]  for your return.
[5284.12 --> 5284.86]  But Lord,
[5284.92 --> 5285.66]  as we wait
[5285.66 --> 5287.50]  in the world
[5287.50 --> 5288.42]  that we are in,
[5289.86 --> 5290.58]  through the happiness
[5290.58 --> 5291.58]  we experience
[5291.58 --> 5292.56]  and the turmoil,
[5292.86 --> 5293.60]  through the peaks
[5293.60 --> 5294.38]  and the valleys,
[5295.56 --> 5295.74]  Lord,
[5295.82 --> 5296.78]  let us be joyful
[5296.78 --> 5298.86]  because we know
[5298.86 --> 5300.20]  that justice
[5300.20 --> 5300.90]  will reign.
[5302.50 --> 5303.08]  And so Lord,
[5303.26 --> 5304.24]  wherever we are
[5304.24 --> 5304.98]  at right now,
[5304.98 --> 5306.80]  however we are feeling,
[5307.46 --> 5308.42]  whatever is happening
[5308.42 --> 5309.60]  in the world around us,
[5310.94 --> 5312.10]  may we lean on you
[5312.10 --> 5313.90]  and may we trust
[5313.90 --> 5314.58]  your promises
[5314.58 --> 5316.04]  that you've always kept
[5316.04 --> 5316.66]  and know
[5316.66 --> 5319.40]  that you will come again,
[5320.00 --> 5321.06]  that you will reign
[5321.06 --> 5322.44]  and that joy
[5322.44 --> 5323.58]  is there
[5323.58 --> 5324.66]  right now.
[5325.32 --> 5326.54]  We can rejoice
[5326.54 --> 5327.94]  in that knowledge
[5327.94 --> 5328.98]  and that understanding
[5328.98 --> 5329.48]  right now
[5329.48 --> 5330.60]  and we will rejoice
[5330.60 --> 5331.50]  in the world
[5331.50 --> 5332.18]  that is to come.
[5332.54 --> 5333.52]  May that truth
[5333.52 --> 5334.76]  permeate our hearts,
[5334.76 --> 5336.14]  not just this Advent season,
[5337.14 --> 5338.32]  but for the rest
[5338.32 --> 5338.98]  of our lives.
[5339.64 --> 5340.36]  We pray this
[5340.36 --> 5340.86]  in your name.
[5341.40 --> 5341.66]  Amen.
[5341.66 --> 5341.76]  Amen.
[5348.06 --> 5348.84]  Please stand
[5348.84 --> 5349.52]  as we sing
[5349.52 --> 5351.12]  One Piece Like a River.
[5351.12 --> 5364.58]  A death.
[5364.58 --> 5364.66]  Amen.
[5364.66 --> 5377.86]  When peace like a river
[5377.86 --> 5383.02]  The dead of my name
[5383.02 --> 5388.24]  When sorrows like sea
[5388.24 --> 5395.88]  The dead of my heart
[5395.88 --> 5401.02]  Thou hast taught me to sing
[5401.02 --> 5406.58]  It is well, it is well
[5406.58 --> 5409.24]  In my soul
[5409.24 --> 5418.22]  It is well, it is well
[5418.22 --> 5422.00]  In my soul
[5422.00 --> 5427.86]  It is well, it is well
[5427.86 --> 5430.86]  In my soul
[5430.86 --> 5437.86]  No saints can check up
[5437.86 --> 5442.86]  No trial should come
[5442.86 --> 5449.22]  Let this rest assure it
[5449.22 --> 5450.50]  The joy
[5450.50 --> 5456.10]  The Christ has begun
[5456.10 --> 5461.40]  The helpless estate
[5461.40 --> 5463.10]  That has shall
[5463.10 --> 5470.84]  Thou hast taught me to sing
[5470.84 --> 5485.02]  In our soul is His word
[5485.02 --> 5491.24]  He is now with my soul
[5491.24 --> 5503.84]  My sin, all the peace of this glorious heart
[5503.84 --> 5511.86]  My sin, not in part, but the whole
[5511.86 --> 5516.86]  His veil to the cross
[5516.86 --> 5522.08]  In our death, in no time
[5522.08 --> 5527.18]  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord
[5527.18 --> 5530.86]  I know my sin
[5530.86 --> 5537.86]  In His veil, in the light
[5537.86 --> 5542.86]  In the light of my heart
[5542.86 --> 5548.08]  In His veil, in the light
[5548.08 --> 5552.08]  In the light of my heart
[5552.08 --> 5554.08]  In the light of my heart
[5554.08 --> 5559.08]  The love of His covenant
[5559.08 --> 5564.86]  Where the faith shall be saved
[5564.86 --> 5570.08]  In the light of my heart
[5570.08 --> 5574.08]  In the light of my heart
[5574.08 --> 5576.08]  The love of His covenant
[5576.08 --> 5578.08]  And the love of His covenant
[5578.08 --> 5583.08]  And the love of His covenant
[5583.08 --> 5592.30]  In the light of my heart
[5592.30 --> 5595.30]  In the light of my heart
[5595.30 --> 5596.26]  In His covenant
[5596.26 --> 5599.30]  And the love of His covenant
[5599.30 --> 5602.30]  In the light of my heart
[5602.30 --> 5604.52]  The love of His covenant
[5604.52 --> 5627.58]  And so may we go from this place rejoicing in that truth
[5627.58 --> 5630.64]  that we know Christ shall descend and he will reign
[5630.64 --> 5632.34]  and we will rejoice with him forever.
[5632.34 --> 5636.46]  I just want to remind everyone if you feel like you are in need of prayer this morning,
[5636.54 --> 5638.16]  there are prayer people in the foyer.
[5638.48 --> 5640.92]  They'll be wearing name tags like these, but they will be yellow.
[5641.38 --> 5644.68]  So if you want to seek them out for prayer today, please, I invite you to do that.
[5645.42 --> 5650.14]  Now, please receive God's blessing from Numbers 6.
[5651.46 --> 5654.22]  The Lord bless you and keep you.
[5654.88 --> 5658.96]  The Lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[5658.96 --> 5664.12]  The Lord turn his face toward you and give you his peace.
[5664.90 --> 5667.40]  And all God's people said, Amen.

[5714.10 --> 5717.78]  Oh, God, sing the angel of all those dead.
[5717.78 --> 5725.06]  Oh, God, sing the angel of all those dead.
[5725.12 --> 5729.74]  Even though Jesus Christ was in the deep.
[5730.84 --> 5734.84]  Oh, God, sing the angel of all those dead.

[5779.46 --> 5784.22]  Bless and bless and bless our hearts
[5784.22 --> 5789.96]  We'll stand together all the stars
[5789.96 --> 5793.50]  We'll wear this light just a day
[5793.50 --> 5796.06]  But we're almost there
