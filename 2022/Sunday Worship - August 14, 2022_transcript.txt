[681.20 --> 687.60]  worship him this morning, which we God's people say, amen. I don't remember. Do we greet each
[687.60 --> 694.32]  other first? We haven't been. Well, consider yourself greeted by each other. Let's worship
[694.32 --> 704.10]  the Lord. Yeah. Our call to worship this morning comes from Psalm 16. Lord, you alone are my
[704.10 --> 712.46]  portion and my cup. You make my lot secure. The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant
[712.46 --> 720.52]  places. Surely I have a delightful inheritance. Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices.
[720.52 --> 728.20]  My body also will rest secure because you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead,
[728.20 --> 736.44]  nor will you let your faithful one see decay. You will make known to me the path of life.
[737.10 --> 743.32]  You will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand.
[758.20 --> 788.18]  The splendor of the King, clothed in majesty, let all the earth rejoice. All the earth rejoice.
[788.18 --> 804.18]  He wraps himself in light. And darkness tries to hide. And trembles at his voice.
[804.18 --> 818.16]  Trembles at his voice. How great is our God. Sing with me how great is our God.
[818.18 --> 843.18]  And all will see how great, how great is our God. And age to age he stands. And time is in his hands.
[843.18 --> 845.18]  You will find his voice. How great is our God.
[845.18 --> 854.18]  Beginning and the end. Beginning and the end. Beginning and the end. The God-red three in one.

[999.98 --> 1003.36]  You heard my cry
[1003.36 --> 1006.74]  And waves of mercy
[1006.74 --> 1010.74]  And waves of mercy pour down on my heart
[1010.74 --> 1012.12]  I will sing

[1037.50 --> 1038.88]  Of death
[1038.88 --> 1039.88]  Of death defeated
[1039.88 --> 1044.88]  And life without end
[1044.88 --> 1046.26]  Of death
[1046.26 --> 1048.26]  Beautiful Savior
[1048.26 --> 1050.26]  Beautiful Savior

[1111.98 --> 1119.14]  And Christ of worthy will honor the Lamb
[1119.14 --> 1127.96]  Beautiful Savior, Wonderful Counselor
[1128.48 --> 1132.28]  Clothed in majesty, Lord of history
[1132.28 --> 1136.48]  You're the way, the truth, the life
[1136.48 --> 1139.60]  Star of the morning
[1139.60 --> 1144.00]  Glorious in holiness
[1144.00 --> 1148.76]  You're the risen one, heaven's champion
[1148.76 --> 1156.52]  And you reign, you reign over all
[1156.52 --> 1162.08]  Please pray with me
[1162.08 --> 1169.72]  Father, we come to you to confess our failures and sins to you this morning.
[1170.42 --> 1177.10]  We know that we do not deserve your grace and goodness, yet you love us despite our shortcomings.
[1177.10 --> 1180.90]  You meet us where we're at again and again.
[1181.80 --> 1189.84]  Lord, we pray that as our faith fails, when temptation prevails, and when we feel like we can't hold on to you any longer,
[1190.36 --> 1193.30]  that you would continue to hold us fast.
[1193.30 --> 1196.88]  Thank you for your promise to never let us go.
[1197.28 --> 1198.68]  Thank you for your forgiveness.
[1199.64 --> 1200.90]  We love you, Lord Jesus.
[1201.90 --> 1202.26]  Amen.
[1202.26 --> 1203.00]  Amen.
[1203.00 --> 1205.20]  Amen.
[1221.16 --> 1222.60]  Amen.
[1222.60 --> 1236.14]  When I fear my faith will fail, Christ will hold me fast.
[1236.14 --> 1245.20]  When the tempter would prevail, Christ will hold me fast.
[1245.20 --> 1254.00]  I could never keep my hold through life's faithful path.
[1254.00 --> 1263.08]  For my love is often cold, He must hold me fast.
[1265.04 --> 1272.70]  He will hold me fast, He will hold me fast.
[1272.70 --> 1282.94]  For my Savior loves me so, He will hold me fast.
[1290.88 --> 1299.74]  Those He saves are His delight, Christ will hold me fast.
[1299.74 --> 1308.48]  Precious in His holy sight, He will hold me fast.
[1308.90 --> 1317.24]  He'll not let my soul be lost, His promises shall last.
[1317.64 --> 1325.32]  But by Him at such a cost, He will hold me fast.
[1325.32 --> 1331.76]  He will hold me fast.
[1331.76 --> 1335.44]  He will hold me fast.
[1335.44 --> 1344.66]  For my Savior loves me so, He will hold me fast.
[1344.66 --> 1363.02]  For my life He bled and died, Christ will hold me fast.
[1363.02 --> 1371.76]  Just as has been satisfied, He will hold me fast.
[1371.76 --> 1376.44]  Grace will live to end his time.
[1376.44 --> 1380.16]  He will hold me fast.
[1380.16 --> 1384.66]  Till our faith is turned to sight.
[1384.66 --> 1390.26]  When He comes at last.
[1390.26 --> 1394.34]  He will hold me fast.
[1394.34 --> 1395.34]  He will hold me fast.
[1395.34 --> 1398.34]  He will hold me fast.
[1398.34 --> 1406.34]  For my Savior loves me so, He will hold me fast.
[1406.34 --> 1413.34]  He will hold me fast.
[1413.34 --> 1427.34]  For my Savior loves me so, He will hold me fast.
[1427.34 --> 1428.58]  From Romans 6.
[1428.58 --> 1436.10]  But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the benefit you
[1436.10 --> 1440.48]  reap leads to holiness, and the result is eternal life.
[1440.48 --> 1447.48]  For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[1447.48 --> 1477.48] 
[1477.48 --> 1486.18]  To look upon the one who bled to save me
[1486.18 --> 1492.66]  And walk with him for all eternity
[1492.66 --> 1504.84]  There will be a day when all will bow before him
[1504.84 --> 1511.84]  There will be a day when death will be no more
[1512.36 --> 1520.84]  Standing face to face with he who died and rose again
[1521.40 --> 1527.84]  Holy, holy is the Lord
[1527.84 --> 1538.16]  Every prayer we pray in desperation
[1538.16 --> 1545.84]  The songs of faith we sang through doubt and fear
[1545.84 --> 1553.84]  In the end we'll see that it was worth it
[1553.84 --> 1560.84]  When he returns to wipe away our tears
[1560.84 --> 1571.84]  There will be a day when all will bow before him
[1571.84 --> 1578.84]  There will be a day when death will be no more
[1578.84 --> 1588.16]  Standing face to face with him who died and rose again
[1588.16 --> 1594.84]  Holy, holy is the Lord
[1594.84 --> 1605.08]  And on that day we join the resurrection
[1605.08 --> 1612.44]  And stand beside the heroes of the pain
[1612.44 --> 1619.44]  And with one voice a thousand generations
[1619.44 --> 1626.44]  Sing, worthy is the Lamb who was saved
[1626.44 --> 1633.44]  And on that day we join the resurrection
[1633.44 --> 1640.44]  As stand beside the heroes of the pain
[1640.44 --> 1648.44]  And with one voice a thousand generations
[1648.44 --> 1655.44]  Sing, worthy is the Lamb who was saved
[1655.44 --> 1662.44]  For the Lord's name, worthy is the Lamb who was saved
[1662.44 --> 1664.44]  And on that day we join the Lord
[1664.44 --> 1665.44]  And on that day we join the Lord
[1665.44 --> 1669.44]  There will be a day when all will bow before him
[1669.44 --> 1670.44]  There will be a day when death will be no more
[1670.44 --> 1685.44]  Standing face to face with him who died and rose again
[1685.44 --> 1690.44]  Holy, holy is the Lord
[1690.44 --> 1695.44]  Holy, holy is the Lord
[1695.44 --> 1697.44]  Will it be today
[1697.44 --> 1701.44]  We shout the hymn of heaven
[1701.44 --> 1705.44]  With angels and the saints
[1705.44 --> 1709.44]  We raise a mighty Lord
[1709.44 --> 1712.44]  Glory to our God
[1712.44 --> 1717.44]  Who gave us life beyond their name
[1717.44 --> 1724.44]  Holy, holy is the Lord
[1724.44 --> 1731.44]  Holy, holy is the Lord
[1731.44 --> 1738.44]  Holy, holy is the Lord

[1751.08 --> 1760.68]  Hilary,
[1761.44 --> 1766.30]  Are you the Lord
[1766.30 --> 1779.08]  What is our hope in life and death?
[1779.08 --> 1783.08]  Christ alone, Christ alone.
[1784.00 --> 1788.16]  What is our only confidence?
[1789.74 --> 1794.18]  That our souls to him belong.
[1794.18 --> 1799.56]  Who holds our days within his hand?
[1799.98 --> 1804.12]  Who comes apart from his command?
[1804.12 --> 1810.06]  And what will keep us to the end?
[1810.52 --> 1817.02]  The love of Christ in which we stand.
[1817.02 --> 1823.18]  Oh, sing hallelujah.
[1824.08 --> 1828.46]  Our hope springs eternal.
[1829.24 --> 1833.64]  Oh, sing hallelujah.
[1834.48 --> 1838.22]  Now and ever we confess.
[1838.66 --> 1842.02]  Christ our hope in life and death.
[1842.02 --> 1855.34]  What truth can calm the child of soul?
[1855.84 --> 1857.74]  God is good.
[1858.46 --> 1860.26]  God is good.
[1860.64 --> 1865.40]  Where is his grace and goodness known?
[1865.40 --> 1870.68]  In our great Redeemer's blood.
[1871.12 --> 1875.34]  Who holds our faith when fears arise?
[1876.16 --> 1881.10]  Who stands above the stormy child?
[1881.60 --> 1886.52]  Who sends the waves that bring us young?
[1886.52 --> 1892.38]  And to the shore of the rock of Christ.
[1892.38 --> 1899.22]  Oh, sing hallelujah.
[1900.08 --> 1904.32]  Our hope springs eternal.
[1904.32 --> 1909.34]  Oh, sing hallelujah.
[1909.34 --> 1913.94]  Now and ever we confess.
[1914.44 --> 1919.48]  Christ our hope in life and death.
[1919.48 --> 1924.48]  Christ our hope in life and death.
[1924.48 --> 1925.48]  Amen.
[1925.48 --> 1931.22]  Unto the grave what will we sing?
[1931.78 --> 1936.40]  Christ he lives, Christ he lives.
[1936.74 --> 1941.98]  And what reward will heaven bring?
[1941.98 --> 1946.94]  Everlasting life with him.
[1947.38 --> 1952.22]  Then we will rise to meet the Lord.
[1952.62 --> 1956.98]  Then sin and death will be destroyed.
[1957.78 --> 1962.66]  And we will feast in endless joy.

[2840.78 --> 2850.36]  I think I'd rather be down here
[2850.36 --> 2851.14]  if you don't mind
[2851.14 --> 2855.84]  hopefully you can all see me
[2855.84 --> 2858.14]  I feel like I'm a little bit more
[2858.14 --> 2858.92]  a part of you
[2858.92 --> 2863.38]  something that
[2863.38 --> 2866.72]  you might take for granted
[2866.72 --> 2868.62]  coming here every week
[2868.62 --> 2869.74]  but
[2869.74 --> 2871.12]  tradition
[2871.12 --> 2872.10]  or
[2872.10 --> 2873.92]  habit
[2873.92 --> 2875.02]  that you
[2875.02 --> 2876.40]  several of them
[2876.40 --> 2877.46]  that you have here
[2877.46 --> 2877.98]  that
[2877.98 --> 2878.96]  we
[2878.96 --> 2879.90]  appreciate
[2879.90 --> 2880.50]  is
[2880.50 --> 2882.46]  deacons
[2882.46 --> 2884.20]  making the announcement
[2884.20 --> 2885.32]  about the offering
[2885.32 --> 2886.92]  elders
[2886.92 --> 2888.34]  praying
[2888.34 --> 2889.60]  and
[2889.60 --> 2890.10]  this
[2890.10 --> 2891.24]  little habit
[2891.24 --> 2892.18]  of blessing
[2892.18 --> 2893.06]  you know
[2893.06 --> 2893.68]  the kids
[2893.68 --> 2894.96]  these are
[2894.96 --> 2897.50]  wonderful things
[2897.50 --> 2898.50]  that maybe you take
[2898.50 --> 2899.16]  for granted
[2899.16 --> 2900.04]  but they're
[2900.04 --> 2901.32]  I think they're very
[2901.32 --> 2903.92]  they're rich traditions
[2903.92 --> 2904.66]  they're healthy
[2904.66 --> 2904.90]  traditions
[2904.90 --> 2905.60]  traditions
[2905.60 --> 2910.50]  some time ago
[2910.50 --> 2911.80]  Pastor Chris
[2911.80 --> 2913.12]  I think back in June
[2913.12 --> 2914.10]  said we're going to do
[2914.10 --> 2915.38]  parables for the summer
[2915.38 --> 2917.32]  go ahead and pick one
[2917.32 --> 2919.18]  so I did
[2919.18 --> 2920.28]  and so we're
[2920.28 --> 2921.76]  looking at another
[2921.76 --> 2922.46]  parable
[2922.46 --> 2922.84]  the
[2922.84 --> 2924.24]  parable of the
[2924.24 --> 2925.04]  rich man
[2925.04 --> 2925.66]  and
[2925.66 --> 2927.04]  Lazarus
[2927.04 --> 2928.22]  and
[2928.22 --> 2931.02]  the prayer
[2931.02 --> 2932.06]  this morning
[2932.06 --> 2932.84]  made me
[2932.84 --> 2934.48]  it was in that way
[2934.48 --> 2935.36]  appropriate too
[2935.36 --> 2936.36]  how do you think about
[2936.36 --> 2937.28]  street people
[2937.28 --> 2938.04]  and
[2938.04 --> 2939.20]  these are some
[2939.20 --> 2940.18]  of the poor
[2940.18 --> 2941.30]  that are
[2941.30 --> 2942.32]  among us
[2942.32 --> 2946.86]  Luke 16
[2946.86 --> 2947.86]  actually has two
[2947.86 --> 2948.78]  parables in it
[2948.78 --> 2953.90]  I've preached the other
[2953.90 --> 2954.54]  one here
[2954.54 --> 2955.96]  I'm sure you all
[2955.96 --> 2956.82]  remember it
[2956.82 --> 2958.20]  it's about
[2958.20 --> 2958.78]  I don't know
[2958.78 --> 2959.82]  a couple years ago
[2959.82 --> 2961.22]  both these parables
[2961.22 --> 2962.22]  are about money
[2962.22 --> 2964.20]  and riches
[2964.20 --> 2967.46]  the first parable
[2967.46 --> 2969.62]  in Luke 16
[2969.62 --> 2971.80]  is about
[2971.80 --> 2973.02]  the shrewd
[2973.02 --> 2973.76]  manager
[2973.76 --> 2974.42]  where
[2974.42 --> 2977.04]  Jesus makes this
[2977.04 --> 2978.60]  it seems like
[2978.60 --> 2979.66]  a strange
[2979.66 --> 2980.38]  statement
[2980.38 --> 2982.18]  to use
[2982.18 --> 2983.46]  worldly
[2983.46 --> 2984.46]  wealth
[2984.46 --> 2986.28]  Luke 16
[2986.28 --> 2987.00]  9
[2987.00 --> 2988.40]  use
[2988.40 --> 2989.20]  worldly
[2989.20 --> 2989.94]  wealth
[2989.94 --> 2991.02]  to gain
[2991.02 --> 2992.08]  friends
[2992.08 --> 2993.46]  for yourself
[2993.46 --> 2995.60]  that's like
[2995.60 --> 2996.70]  use
[2996.70 --> 2997.18]  your
[2997.18 --> 2998.02]  cash
[2998.02 --> 2999.18]  to build
[2999.18 --> 2999.88]  good
[2999.88 --> 3000.62]  connections
[3000.62 --> 3002.10]  one of the
[3002.10 --> 3002.80]  best things
[3002.80 --> 3003.20]  you can do
[3003.20 --> 3003.72]  with money
[3003.72 --> 3007.10]  money
[3007.10 --> 3007.46]  is
[3007.46 --> 3008.26]  a huge
[3008.26 --> 3008.54]  thing
[3008.54 --> 3009.30]  and as I say
[3009.30 --> 3009.70]  both
[3009.70 --> 3010.52]  that parable
[3010.52 --> 3010.94]  and the one
[3010.94 --> 3011.52]  we're looking at
[3011.52 --> 3011.92]  have to do
[3011.92 --> 3012.40]  with money
[3012.40 --> 3013.14]  because at the
[3013.14 --> 3013.44]  end of that
[3013.44 --> 3013.70]  parable
[3013.70 --> 3013.98]  he says
[3013.98 --> 3014.48]  you can't
[3014.48 --> 3014.96]  serve two
[3014.96 --> 3015.48]  masters
[3015.48 --> 3017.78]  you can't
[3017.78 --> 3018.48]  serve both
[3018.48 --> 3019.16]  God
[3019.16 --> 3021.22]  and money
[3021.22 --> 3022.74]  and then
[3022.74 --> 3023.86]  in verse 14
[3023.86 --> 3026.20]  Luke notes
[3026.20 --> 3028.10]  the Pharisees
[3028.10 --> 3030.50]  who loved
[3030.50 --> 3031.60]  money
[3031.60 --> 3034.90]  heard all
[3034.90 --> 3035.34]  this
[3035.34 --> 3037.22]  and were
[3037.22 --> 3038.30]  sneering
[3038.30 --> 3039.46]  at Jesus
[3039.46 --> 3040.92]  mockers
[3040.92 --> 3041.30]  in the
[3041.30 --> 3041.62]  pew
[3041.62 --> 3044.30]  I think
[3044.30 --> 3044.96]  the next
[3044.96 --> 3045.62]  parable
[3045.62 --> 3046.74]  the rich
[3046.74 --> 3047.14]  man
[3047.14 --> 3048.16]  and
[3048.16 --> 3049.54]  Lazarus
[3049.54 --> 3054.10]  is
[3054.10 --> 3055.24]  directed
[3055.24 --> 3055.76]  for
[3055.76 --> 3057.34]  the Pharisee
[3057.34 --> 3058.36]  in all
[3058.36 --> 3059.02]  of us
[3059.02 --> 3060.06]  who love
[3060.06 --> 3060.46]  money
[3060.46 --> 3065.98]  and
[3065.98 --> 3066.36]  in this
[3066.36 --> 3066.86]  parable
[3066.86 --> 3068.14]  Jesus
[3068.14 --> 3068.82]  is also
[3068.82 --> 3069.34]  saying
[3069.34 --> 3069.76]  as he
[3069.76 --> 3070.08]  talks
[3070.08 --> 3070.32]  about
[3070.32 --> 3070.70]  money
[3070.70 --> 3071.04]  that
[3071.04 --> 3071.26]  it
[3071.26 --> 3072.64]  can't
[3072.64 --> 3073.00]  buy
[3073.00 --> 3073.54]  you
[3073.54 --> 3074.48]  or
[3074.48 --> 3074.92]  your
[3074.92 --> 3076.02]  friends
[3076.02 --> 3077.70]  eternal
[3077.70 --> 3078.24]  life
[3078.24 --> 3079.40]  you can
[3079.40 --> 3080.04]  use money
[3080.04 --> 3080.46]  to build
[3080.46 --> 3081.04]  connections
[3081.04 --> 3081.50]  but
[3081.50 --> 3082.56]  you
[3082.56 --> 3083.56]  can't
[3083.56 --> 3083.78]  buy
[3083.78 --> 3084.22]  your way
[3084.22 --> 3084.48]  into
[3084.48 --> 3084.88]  heaven
[3084.88 --> 3086.44]  here's
[3086.44 --> 3086.60]  the
[3086.60 --> 3087.04]  parable
[3087.04 --> 3090.46]  there
[3090.46 --> 3090.80]  was a
[3090.80 --> 3091.00]  rich
[3091.00 --> 3091.38]  man
[3091.38 --> 3093.52]  who
[3093.52 --> 3093.74]  was
[3093.74 --> 3094.08]  dressed
[3094.08 --> 3094.34]  in
[3094.34 --> 3094.70]  purple
[3094.70 --> 3094.96]  and
[3094.96 --> 3095.34]  fine
[3095.34 --> 3095.66]  linen
[3095.66 --> 3095.98]  and
[3095.98 --> 3096.34]  lived
[3096.34 --> 3096.62]  in
[3096.62 --> 3097.16]  luxury
[3097.16 --> 3098.10]  every
[3098.10 --> 3098.48]  day
[3098.48 --> 3100.82]  at
[3100.82 --> 3101.08]  his
[3101.08 --> 3101.54]  gate
[3101.54 --> 3101.82]  was
[3101.82 --> 3102.06]  laid
[3102.06 --> 3102.30]  a
[3102.30 --> 3102.68]  beggar
[3102.68 --> 3103.22]  named
[3103.22 --> 3104.20]  Lazarus
[3104.20 --> 3105.04]  covered
[3105.04 --> 3105.38]  with
[3105.38 --> 3105.94]  sores
[3105.94 --> 3106.42]  and
[3106.42 --> 3107.04]  longing
[3107.04 --> 3107.42]  to
[3107.42 --> 3107.70]  eat
[3107.70 --> 3107.94]  what
[3107.94 --> 3108.24]  fell
[3108.24 --> 3108.48]  from
[3108.48 --> 3108.66]  the
[3108.66 --> 3108.90]  rich
[3108.90 --> 3109.40]  man's
[3109.40 --> 3109.92]  table
[3109.92 --> 3110.94]  even
[3110.94 --> 3111.24]  the
[3111.24 --> 3111.82]  dogs
[3111.82 --> 3112.46]  came
[3112.46 --> 3113.12]  and
[3113.12 --> 3113.68]  licked
[3113.68 --> 3114.30]  his
[3114.30 --> 3114.94]  sores
[3114.94 --> 3116.54]  the
[3116.54 --> 3116.86]  time
[3116.86 --> 3117.18]  came
[3117.18 --> 3117.34]  when
[3117.34 --> 3117.50]  the
[3117.50 --> 3117.82]  beggar
[3117.82 --> 3118.28]  died
[3118.28 --> 3118.48]  and
[3118.48 --> 3118.62]  the
[3118.62 --> 3119.00]  angels
[3119.00 --> 3119.42]  carried
[3119.42 --> 3119.60]  him
[3119.60 --> 3119.74]  to
[3119.74 --> 3120.32]  Abraham's
[3120.32 --> 3120.72]  side
[3120.72 --> 3121.36]  the
[3121.36 --> 3121.54]  rich
[3121.54 --> 3121.78]  man
[3121.78 --> 3122.12]  also
[3122.12 --> 3122.48]  died
[3122.48 --> 3122.66]  and
[3122.66 --> 3122.84]  was
[3122.84 --> 3123.22]  buried
[3123.22 --> 3124.10]  in
[3124.10 --> 3124.50]  Hades
[3124.50 --> 3124.84]  where
[3124.84 --> 3125.14]  he
[3125.14 --> 3125.52]  was
[3125.52 --> 3125.82]  in
[3125.82 --> 3126.30]  torment
[3126.30 --> 3126.72]  he
[3126.72 --> 3127.12]  looked
[3127.12 --> 3127.54]  up
[3127.54 --> 3128.34]  and
[3128.34 --> 3128.54]  saw
[3128.54 --> 3129.12]  Abraham
[3129.12 --> 3129.86]  far
[3129.86 --> 3130.38]  away
[3130.38 --> 3131.40]  with
[3131.40 --> 3132.36]  Lazarus
[3132.36 --> 3132.86]  by his
[3132.86 --> 3133.26]  side
[3133.26 --> 3134.84]  so he
[3134.84 --> 3135.14]  called
[3135.14 --> 3135.46]  him
[3135.46 --> 3136.86]  father
[3136.86 --> 3137.46]  Abraham
[3137.46 --> 3138.56]  have
[3138.56 --> 3138.94]  pity
[3138.94 --> 3139.24]  on
[3139.24 --> 3139.52]  me
[3139.52 --> 3139.72]  and
[3139.72 --> 3140.18]  send
[3140.18 --> 3140.88]  Lazarus
[3140.88 --> 3141.14]  to
[3141.14 --> 3142.12]  dip
[3142.12 --> 3142.38]  the
[3142.38 --> 3142.64]  tip
[3142.64 --> 3143.00]  of his
[3143.00 --> 3143.38]  finger
[3143.38 --> 3143.58]  in
[3143.58 --> 3143.88]  water
[3143.88 --> 3144.12]  and
[3144.12 --> 3144.80]  cool
[3144.80 --> 3145.10]  my
[3145.10 --> 3145.46]  tongue
[3145.46 --> 3145.74]  because
[3145.74 --> 3146.64]  I'm
[3146.64 --> 3146.78]  in
[3146.78 --> 3147.32]  agony
[3147.32 --> 3147.62]  in
[3147.62 --> 3147.84]  this
[3147.84 --> 3148.24]  fire
[3148.24 --> 3149.90]  but
[3149.90 --> 3150.26]  Abraham
[3150.26 --> 3150.90]  replied
[3150.90 --> 3152.02]  son
[3152.02 --> 3154.78]  remember
[3154.78 --> 3155.56]  that in
[3155.56 --> 3155.74]  your
[3155.74 --> 3156.34]  lifetime
[3156.34 --> 3156.74]  you
[3156.74 --> 3157.30]  received
[3157.30 --> 3158.00]  your
[3158.00 --> 3158.26]  good
[3158.26 --> 3158.82]  things
[3158.82 --> 3159.62]  while
[3159.62 --> 3160.34]  Lazarus
[3160.34 --> 3160.92]  received
[3160.92 --> 3161.28]  bad
[3161.28 --> 3161.82]  things
[3161.82 --> 3163.14]  but
[3163.14 --> 3163.34]  now
[3163.34 --> 3163.74]  he is
[3163.74 --> 3164.34]  comforted
[3164.34 --> 3164.78]  here
[3164.78 --> 3165.60]  and
[3165.60 --> 3165.84]  you
[3165.84 --> 3166.06]  are
[3166.06 --> 3166.20]  in
[3166.20 --> 3166.62]  agony
[3166.62 --> 3169.18]  and
[3169.18 --> 3169.54]  besides
[3169.54 --> 3169.94]  all
[3169.94 --> 3170.22]  this
[3170.22 --> 3170.58]  between
[3170.58 --> 3171.00]  us
[3171.00 --> 3171.16]  and
[3171.16 --> 3171.32]  you
[3171.32 --> 3171.52]  a
[3171.52 --> 3171.84]  great
[3171.84 --> 3172.38]  chasm
[3172.38 --> 3172.70]  has
[3172.70 --> 3172.90]  been
[3172.90 --> 3173.24]  set
[3173.24 --> 3173.46]  in
[3173.46 --> 3173.86]  place
[3173.86 --> 3174.02]  so
[3174.02 --> 3174.16]  that
[3174.16 --> 3174.58]  those
[3174.58 --> 3175.12]  who
[3175.12 --> 3175.42]  want
[3175.42 --> 3175.60]  to
[3175.60 --> 3175.80]  go
[3175.80 --> 3176.06]  from
[3176.06 --> 3176.40]  here
[3176.40 --> 3176.68]  to
[3176.68 --> 3177.12]  you
[3177.12 --> 3177.92]  cannot
[3177.92 --> 3178.98]  nor
[3178.98 --> 3179.32]  can
[3179.32 --> 3179.78]  anyone
[3179.78 --> 3180.42]  cross
[3180.42 --> 3180.88]  over
[3180.88 --> 3181.44]  from
[3181.44 --> 3182.02]  there
[3182.02 --> 3182.64]  to
[3182.64 --> 3183.28]  us
[3183.28 --> 3186.14]  he
[3186.14 --> 3186.52]  answered
[3186.52 --> 3186.70]  then
[3186.70 --> 3186.84]  I
[3186.84 --> 3187.28]  beg
[3187.28 --> 3187.48]  you
[3187.48 --> 3187.92]  father
[3187.92 --> 3188.40]  send
[3188.40 --> 3189.06]  Lazarus
[3189.06 --> 3189.24]  to
[3189.24 --> 3189.46]  my
[3189.46 --> 3190.04]  family
[3190.04 --> 3190.34]  for
[3190.34 --> 3190.54]  I
[3190.54 --> 3190.74]  have
[3190.74 --> 3191.16]  five
[3191.16 --> 3191.74]  brothers
[3191.74 --> 3193.86]  let him
[3193.86 --> 3194.24]  warn
[3194.24 --> 3194.54]  them
[3194.54 --> 3194.90]  so that
[3194.90 --> 3195.04]  they
[3195.04 --> 3195.22]  will
[3195.22 --> 3195.44]  not
[3195.44 --> 3195.78]  also
[3195.78 --> 3196.08]  come
[3196.08 --> 3196.24]  to
[3196.24 --> 3196.46]  this
[3196.46 --> 3196.80]  place
[3196.80 --> 3196.98]  of
[3196.98 --> 3197.46]  torment
[3197.46 --> 3199.08]  Abraham
[3199.08 --> 3199.64]  replied
[3199.64 --> 3200.54]  they
[3200.54 --> 3200.88]  have
[3200.88 --> 3201.38]  Moses
[3201.38 --> 3201.70]  and
[3201.70 --> 3201.84]  the
[3201.84 --> 3202.36]  prophets
[3202.36 --> 3202.72]  let
[3202.72 --> 3202.90]  them
[3202.90 --> 3203.22]  listen
[3203.22 --> 3203.44]  to
[3203.44 --> 3203.80]  them
[3203.80 --> 3205.62]  no
[3205.62 --> 3206.14]  father
[3206.14 --> 3206.66]  Abraham
[3206.66 --> 3207.06]  but if
[3207.06 --> 3207.36]  someone
[3207.36 --> 3207.84]  from the
[3207.84 --> 3208.16]  dead
[3208.16 --> 3208.50]  goes
[3208.50 --> 3208.68]  to
[3208.68 --> 3208.92]  them
[3208.92 --> 3209.72]  they
[3209.72 --> 3210.12]  will
[3210.12 --> 3210.84]  repent
[3210.84 --> 3213.64]  and
[3213.64 --> 3214.08]  Abraham
[3214.08 --> 3214.54]  said
[3214.54 --> 3214.72]  to
[3214.72 --> 3214.98]  them
[3214.98 --> 3215.64]  if
[3215.64 --> 3215.86]  they
[3215.86 --> 3216.12]  do
[3216.12 --> 3216.42]  not
[3216.42 --> 3216.94]  listen
[3216.94 --> 3217.72]  to
[3217.72 --> 3218.28]  Moses
[3218.28 --> 3219.08]  and
[3219.08 --> 3219.32]  the
[3219.32 --> 3219.88]  prophets
[3219.88 --> 3221.30]  they
[3221.30 --> 3221.54]  will
[3221.54 --> 3222.06]  not
[3222.06 --> 3222.56]  be
[3222.56 --> 3223.20]  convinced
[3223.20 --> 3224.02]  even
[3224.02 --> 3224.72]  if
[3224.72 --> 3225.26]  someone
[3225.26 --> 3226.00]  rises
[3226.00 --> 3227.20]  from
[3227.20 --> 3227.38]  the
[3227.38 --> 3227.68]  dead
[3227.68 --> 3228.94]  the
[3228.94 --> 3229.22]  word
[3229.22 --> 3229.38]  of
[3229.38 --> 3229.50]  the
[3229.50 --> 3229.90]  Lord
[3229.90 --> 3231.26]  thanks
[3231.26 --> 3231.50]  be
[3231.50 --> 3231.70]  to
[3231.70 --> 3232.10]  God
[3232.10 --> 3234.44]  well
[3234.44 --> 3234.58]  if
[3234.58 --> 3234.72]  you
[3234.72 --> 3235.08]  want
[3235.08 --> 3235.32]  to
[3235.32 --> 3236.08]  seriously
[3236.08 --> 3236.48]  get
[3236.48 --> 3237.04]  into
[3237.04 --> 3237.76]  a
[3237.76 --> 3238.40]  spiritual
[3238.40 --> 3239.70]  discussion
[3239.70 --> 3240.50]  with
[3240.50 --> 3241.04]  someone
[3241.04 --> 3242.28]  brothers
[3242.28 --> 3242.62]  and
[3242.62 --> 3243.02]  sisters
[3243.02 --> 3244.26]  it's
[3244.26 --> 3244.68]  good
[3244.68 --> 3244.94]  to
[3244.94 --> 3245.42]  ask
[3245.42 --> 3245.70]  them
[3245.70 --> 3246.00]  what
[3246.00 --> 3246.92]  do
[3246.92 --> 3247.14]  you
[3247.14 --> 3247.54]  think
[3247.54 --> 3248.22]  happens
[3248.22 --> 3248.78]  when
[3248.78 --> 3248.94]  you
[3248.94 --> 3249.24]  die
[3249.24 --> 3254.14]  do
[3254.14 --> 3254.30]  you
[3254.30 --> 3254.60]  believe
[3254.60 --> 3254.78]  in
[3254.78 --> 3255.14]  life
[3255.14 --> 3255.48]  after
[3255.48 --> 3255.88]  death
[3255.88 --> 3258.44]  an
[3258.44 --> 3259.54]  unchurched
[3259.54 --> 3259.96]  person
[3259.96 --> 3260.64]  told me
[3260.64 --> 3260.88]  this
[3260.88 --> 3261.08]  one
[3261.08 --> 3261.24]  time
[3261.24 --> 3261.38]  these
[3261.38 --> 3261.46]  are
[3261.46 --> 3261.64]  good
[3261.64 --> 3262.16]  questions
[3262.16 --> 3262.38]  do
[3262.38 --> 3264.24]  you
[3264.24 --> 3264.60]  think
[3264.60 --> 3264.88]  there's
[3264.88 --> 3265.04]  a
[3265.04 --> 3265.32]  heaven
[3265.32 --> 3265.66]  and
[3265.66 --> 3266.74]  well
[3266.74 --> 3267.10]  most
[3267.10 --> 3267.28]  do
[3267.28 --> 3267.44]  that
[3267.44 --> 3267.74]  but
[3267.74 --> 3267.94]  a
[3267.94 --> 3268.32]  hell
[3268.32 --> 3271.52]  and
[3271.52 --> 3271.74]  do
[3271.74 --> 3271.92]  you
[3271.92 --> 3272.46]  actually
[3272.46 --> 3273.18]  think
[3273.18 --> 3273.62]  that
[3273.62 --> 3273.98]  how
[3273.98 --> 3274.28]  we
[3274.28 --> 3274.64]  live
[3274.64 --> 3274.84]  in
[3274.84 --> 3275.10]  this
[3275.10 --> 3275.68]  life
[3275.68 --> 3278.00]  makes
[3278.00 --> 3278.22]  a
[3278.22 --> 3278.76]  difference
[3278.76 --> 3279.16]  for
[3279.16 --> 3279.32]  the
[3279.32 --> 3279.56]  next
[3279.56 --> 3279.86]  one
[3279.86 --> 3282.36]  this
[3282.36 --> 3282.76]  parable
[3282.76 --> 3283.50]  speaks
[3283.50 --> 3284.32]  to
[3284.32 --> 3284.58]  those
[3284.58 --> 3284.90]  kinds
[3284.90 --> 3285.06]  of
[3285.06 --> 3285.36]  questions
[3285.36 --> 3286.36]  a
[3286.36 --> 3288.60]  couple
[3288.60 --> 3289.18]  points
[3289.18 --> 3290.32]  first
[3290.32 --> 3290.72]  it's
[3290.72 --> 3291.26]  significant
[3291.26 --> 3291.64]  that
[3291.64 --> 3291.92]  this
[3291.92 --> 3292.22]  rich
[3292.22 --> 3292.56]  man
[3292.56 --> 3292.88]  has
[3292.88 --> 3293.22]  no
[3293.22 --> 3293.68]  name
[3293.68 --> 3295.32]  while
[3295.32 --> 3295.52]  the
[3295.52 --> 3295.74]  poor
[3295.74 --> 3296.08]  man
[3296.08 --> 3296.36]  has
[3296.36 --> 3296.52]  a
[3296.52 --> 3296.82]  name
[3296.82 --> 3298.26]  Lazarus
[3298.26 --> 3300.26]  his name
[3300.26 --> 3300.68]  means
[3300.68 --> 3301.14]  God
[3301.14 --> 3301.52]  has
[3301.52 --> 3302.02]  helped
[3302.02 --> 3303.34]  loved
[3303.34 --> 3303.82]  you
[3303.82 --> 3309.54]  God
[3309.54 --> 3310.02]  will
[3310.02 --> 3310.40]  be
[3310.40 --> 3310.80]  old
[3310.80 --> 3311.02]  a
[3311.02 --> 3311.52]  m
[3311.52 --> 3319.50]  god
[3319.50 --> 3320.24]  is
[3320.24 --> 3320.58]  being
[3320.58 --> 3321.18]  honored
[3321.18 --> 3321.66]  and
[3321.66 --> 3322.92]  obeyed
[3322.92 --> 3327.16]  servants, his people, are being named.
[3328.62 --> 3332.94]  That's why genealogies are important in the Bible.
[3332.94 --> 3337.02]  That's why it's important that churches keep records.
[3338.22 --> 3338.90]  People matter.
[3341.84 --> 3346.64]  The scriptures talk about us having our name written in the book of life.
[3346.64 --> 3356.96]  See, so you might say no name Christianity with mass produced religion in the name of institutional
[3356.96 --> 3359.66]  success is not what the scriptures are about.
[3363.42 --> 3368.04]  Well, not just, first of all, then there's this parable, as we said, about money.
[3369.78 --> 3371.52]  A rich and a poor man.
[3373.24 --> 3376.34]  One ends up in heaven and one ends up in hell.
[3376.34 --> 3381.48]  And you might have to do with, you might think it's about, well, if you're rich, you can't
[3381.48 --> 3382.30]  go to heaven.
[3382.50 --> 3384.60]  But if you're poor, you will.
[3386.54 --> 3392.04]  I don't believe this parable condemns money.
[3392.42 --> 3399.40]  It's not immoral to have a lot of money.
[3400.88 --> 3402.82]  I may have said this before.
[3402.82 --> 3408.38]  If it is immoral to be rich, God's in big trouble.
[3410.96 --> 3415.26]  You see, it's how we get it and how we give and steward it.
[3416.02 --> 3417.82]  That's what he's concerned about.
[3420.62 --> 3428.52]  Whether we have little or much, it's what's in our hearts and how we use our hands to, you
[3428.52 --> 3430.88]  might say, implement our wealth.
[3432.06 --> 3437.20]  This rich man has a cold and a callous heart.
[3438.40 --> 3443.90]  He turns a blind eye to this fellow at his doorstep.
[3443.90 --> 3450.16]  And Jesus is judging him for his casual indifference.
[3451.72 --> 3456.84]  Oh, he may have donated to worthwhile causes, but his heart was not engaged.
[3458.48 --> 3460.88]  The dogs at his table had more heart.
[3460.88 --> 3471.64]  Those canines showed mercy by using the healing that's actually in a dog's tongue to lick this
[3471.64 --> 3473.24]  poor man's wounds.
[3475.44 --> 3481.34]  You know, what happens in poor cultures, I think we're increasingly in danger of it in
[3481.34 --> 3485.44]  ours, is there's a larger gap between the rich and the poor.
[3485.44 --> 3499.12]  Here's a very affluent man dressed in purple in fine linen, and he lived in luxury every day.
[3500.58 --> 3502.84]  Tailor-made, expensive suits.
[3503.58 --> 3507.22]  Last time I read the most expensive suit in the world was just under a million.
[3507.22 --> 3516.48]  I remember hearing that some of the people who went to the Oscars had shoes valued at over
[3516.48 --> 3517.12]  a million.
[3518.82 --> 3519.66]  Wow.
[3521.10 --> 3532.38]  This man, living in luxury, does what comes natural to people with wealth, protects himself.
[3533.88 --> 3536.52]  Protects himself even from the poor.
[3537.22 --> 3545.42]  And what he thinks might be the pain of those who could potentially steal from him.
[3546.70 --> 3551.42]  Security continues to be big business.
[3553.02 --> 3560.02]  Yet how do you protect yourself from the powerless feeling that this man surely got when he kept
[3560.02 --> 3565.84]  seeing that poor man sitting at his gate begging for the basics?
[3567.22 --> 3570.46]  Well, modernize it.
[3570.46 --> 3571.58]  It might have helped, you know.
[3571.70 --> 3577.80]  He would drive by with his wonderful vehicle and the windows rolled up, you know, with the dark ones.
[3578.14 --> 3581.82]  He couldn't see in and hopefully he wouldn't look out too much.
[3582.58 --> 3585.92]  Protecting him from the heat and all that's going on.
[3585.92 --> 3597.26]  And while he's driving by, he's probably rationalizing his lack of engagement with the somewhat truism that this fellow was too lazy to work anyways.
[3597.26 --> 3602.26]  And you know, you know, you help one another show up.
[3604.66 --> 3606.98]  Relieving poverty is a bottomless pit.
[3606.98 --> 3612.24]  Only Lazarus doesn't fit his mold.
[3613.66 --> 3615.16]  He's not an immoral man.
[3617.10 --> 3619.84]  He's come by his poverty honestly.
[3621.02 --> 3622.78]  He would love to work.
[3624.38 --> 3629.68]  But he's been disabled due to his illness.
[3629.68 --> 3633.18]  He's not allowed to go out and work.
[3634.64 --> 3637.14]  And begging was his welfare system.
[3638.54 --> 3642.54]  I saw this working a few times when we visited in Vietnam.
[3642.88 --> 3644.64]  I saw beggars on the street.
[3644.86 --> 3648.28]  As they went down the businesses, all the business people were chipping in.
[3649.40 --> 3650.50]  I thought, that's strange.
[3651.54 --> 3654.64]  But this incredibly disabled man had no other option.
[3654.64 --> 3658.24]  So Lazarus wouldn't think of stealing.
[3659.34 --> 3666.86]  And what he's dreaming of is if he could just have some of the food that's dropping from this rich man's table.
[3667.14 --> 3667.98]  Some leftovers.
[3669.60 --> 3671.00]  But he gets ignored.
[3671.84 --> 3673.58]  Well, except by the guard dogs.
[3674.74 --> 3676.06]  And by God.
[3676.96 --> 3678.40]  God hasn't overlooked him.
[3678.40 --> 3686.02]  And so there is this huge contrast between these two men.
[3687.52 --> 3688.92]  In this life.
[3689.80 --> 3691.70]  As in the life to come.
[3692.76 --> 3693.38]  It's like.
[3694.22 --> 3695.88]  If this is a drama.
[3696.04 --> 3697.16]  The curtains drawn.
[3697.34 --> 3698.76]  The props get changed.
[3698.90 --> 3700.72]  And suddenly we're in act two.
[3701.06 --> 3703.94]  And we meet these two in the next life.
[3703.94 --> 3708.46]  And the angels have carried Lazarus up to heaven.
[3708.64 --> 3710.32]  Where he's welcomed by.
[3710.58 --> 3712.66]  As every Jew would only think about.
[3713.30 --> 3714.34]  Father Abraham.
[3716.06 --> 3717.08]  Embraced by him.
[3720.50 --> 3723.30]  Here we get a picture of what God does to those who die.
[3725.38 --> 3726.00]  I don't know about you.
[3726.10 --> 3727.96]  But in my ministry I've read.
[3727.96 --> 3734.18]  And I've heard stories of those who see angels coming.
[3734.88 --> 3736.28]  To take them away.
[3738.42 --> 3743.00]  I remember Dave Alexander telling me about when his dad died.
[3743.56 --> 3744.78]  That's what he saw.
[3744.90 --> 3745.78]  This great light.
[3746.34 --> 3747.68]  And his father passed away.
[3747.90 --> 3749.50]  He said he took the fear of death away.
[3750.08 --> 3750.64]  He was one.
[3750.64 --> 3754.64]  Now we can't be too dogmatic.
[3754.94 --> 3756.64]  About all what might.
[3757.08 --> 3758.00]  Might happen.
[3759.24 --> 3759.90]  When we.
[3760.10 --> 3760.34]  You know.
[3760.42 --> 3761.46]  How we get to heaven.
[3761.78 --> 3763.46]  And how we can identify.
[3763.72 --> 3765.56]  How well are we going to identify.
[3766.24 --> 3767.28]  But we do know this.
[3767.38 --> 3769.72]  We're not going to be part of a nameless crowd.
[3770.10 --> 3771.38]  We will know each other.
[3774.28 --> 3775.10]  But if we.
[3775.60 --> 3776.42]  We might.
[3776.42 --> 3778.88]  If we try and get too much detail.
[3778.88 --> 3779.76]  Out of this parable.
[3779.76 --> 3780.86]  Well we might conclude.
[3781.00 --> 3782.94]  That those who end up on Hades.
[3783.06 --> 3784.20]  On the other side.
[3784.80 --> 3786.94]  Can actually look into heaven.
[3787.20 --> 3789.10]  And see people over there.
[3791.74 --> 3793.48]  And never gain relief.
[3794.00 --> 3794.76]  And I guess.
[3794.92 --> 3795.76]  It could be true.
[3795.84 --> 3797.18]  Because if you think about it.
[3798.28 --> 3799.68]  What's spiritual hell?
[3799.94 --> 3801.02]  It's sitting here.
[3801.50 --> 3803.18]  Watching people over there.
[3804.02 --> 3805.24]  Knowing how good they have it.
[3805.24 --> 3807.50]  And knowing you can never get there.
[3809.76 --> 3810.68]  Oof.
[3811.56 --> 3812.22]  That's hell.
[3812.72 --> 3813.46]  That's painful.
[3814.82 --> 3816.06]  Well in any case.
[3816.44 --> 3817.66]  Here's this man in hell.
[3817.90 --> 3818.02]  After.
[3819.20 --> 3821.74]  I think we can assume he had an expensive funeral.
[3822.00 --> 3823.46]  A pretty ornate casket.
[3823.64 --> 3824.28]  And flowers.
[3824.66 --> 3824.78]  And.
[3825.48 --> 3826.32]  Here he is though.
[3827.18 --> 3827.86]  In hell.
[3828.62 --> 3829.14]  Hades.
[3830.14 --> 3831.18]  His suit's gone.
[3831.18 --> 3831.32]  And.
[3831.32 --> 3836.08]  I remember someone once wrote.
[3836.22 --> 3837.40]  If I can't take it with me.
[3837.46 --> 3838.16]  I'm not going.
[3839.48 --> 3840.74]  Well a nice try.
[3840.92 --> 3841.64]  We're all going.
[3842.14 --> 3842.42]  And.
[3842.74 --> 3844.10]  We're not going to take it with us.
[3844.20 --> 3845.58]  But we will get our reward.
[3846.22 --> 3847.22]  As this man did.
[3848.82 --> 3849.66]  And when he.
[3849.66 --> 3852.10]  Gets to his eternal destination.
[3852.32 --> 3853.54]  He begins to suffer.
[3855.62 --> 3856.30]  And you know.
[3856.36 --> 3857.62]  When we start suffering.
[3858.08 --> 3859.44]  Whatever it is.
[3859.68 --> 3860.46]  That we have.
[3860.68 --> 3861.18]  We start.
[3861.86 --> 3862.84]  Recognizing others.
[3863.68 --> 3863.94]  Who.
[3864.10 --> 3864.72]  Who suffer.
[3866.58 --> 3867.14]  And.
[3867.38 --> 3867.74]  Suddenly.
[3869.22 --> 3870.86]  He's thinking about Lazarus.
[3870.96 --> 3871.20]  Well.
[3873.06 --> 3873.58]  Actually.
[3874.02 --> 3876.04]  I think he's more thinking of himself.
[3877.10 --> 3879.38]  He's not moved to pity anymore about him.
[3879.38 --> 3880.10]  Now he's got.
[3880.42 --> 3880.94]  Self.
[3881.70 --> 3882.02]  Pity.
[3883.02 --> 3884.66]  And now guess who's begging.
[3885.84 --> 3886.54]  It's him.
[3889.00 --> 3890.16]  Father Abraham.
[3890.30 --> 3891.54]  Have pity on me.
[3893.06 --> 3894.42]  Send Lazarus.
[3894.64 --> 3894.74]  To.
[3894.92 --> 3895.76]  To dip.
[3896.16 --> 3896.50]  You know.
[3896.58 --> 3897.92]  The tip of his finger.
[3898.10 --> 3898.56]  In water.
[3898.82 --> 3898.84]  And.
[3898.84 --> 3900.26]  And cool my tongue.
[3900.38 --> 3901.36]  I'm in agony.
[3901.36 --> 3902.34]  In this fire.
[3904.46 --> 3904.90]  I mean.
[3905.48 --> 3905.84]  I mean.
[3905.84 --> 3906.28]  This is.
[3906.46 --> 3907.40]  A little bit more than.
[3907.52 --> 3907.68]  You know.
[3907.74 --> 3908.26]  He ordered.
[3908.42 --> 3909.00]  Too spicy.
[3909.00 --> 3909.90]  Food at a.
[3910.32 --> 3910.70]  You know.
[3911.96 --> 3912.90]  A restaurant.
[3913.16 --> 3914.18]  And he's calling the waiter.
[3914.30 --> 3915.46]  To give him a glass of water.
[3915.58 --> 3915.80]  That's.
[3915.90 --> 3917.14]  Much deeper than that.
[3919.52 --> 3920.56]  But this man.
[3920.68 --> 3922.32]  Thinks he can still make.
[3923.22 --> 3923.66]  Demands.
[3924.50 --> 3926.06]  He's always been in control.
[3926.14 --> 3926.72]  Of his life.
[3928.78 --> 3929.86]  The great sin.
[3929.94 --> 3931.16]  Of not only many rich.
[3931.28 --> 3932.20]  But of all too many.
[3932.20 --> 3933.20]  In affluent countries.
[3933.20 --> 3934.20]  Out of concern.
[3934.20 --> 3937.30]  Out of concern for.
[3938.68 --> 3939.36]  Ourselves.
[3939.36 --> 3940.40]  People are quick.
[3940.40 --> 3940.96]  To make.
[3941.22 --> 3941.90]  Demands.
[3943.42 --> 3944.56]  We used to buying.
[3945.00 --> 3945.60]  Ordering.
[3947.36 --> 3947.96]  Well.
[3948.58 --> 3949.48]  Not so.
[3949.58 --> 3950.62]  On the other side.
[3952.82 --> 3953.38]  So.
[3953.46 --> 3954.40]  Abram reminds.
[3954.40 --> 3955.62]  His lost son.
[3955.72 --> 3956.52]  He calls him.
[3956.52 --> 3958.02]  That now.
[3958.02 --> 3959.28]  He's starting to dream.
[3959.28 --> 3960.00]  Of relief.
[3960.00 --> 3960.92]  From the heat.
[3962.30 --> 3962.90]  And.
[3962.98 --> 3964.54]  The very thing.
[3965.84 --> 3966.46]  Lazarus.
[3966.46 --> 3967.08]  Used to have.
[3967.30 --> 3968.48]  Similar dreams.
[3968.48 --> 3969.22]  Of relief.
[3969.88 --> 3970.80]  From probably heat.
[3970.80 --> 3971.80]  And hunger.
[3971.80 --> 3975.44]  It seems a little harsh.
[3975.54 --> 3975.94]  Doesn't it?
[3976.58 --> 3977.10]  Son.
[3977.32 --> 3978.34]  Remember how.
[3978.42 --> 3979.28]  In your lifetime.
[3981.18 --> 3981.44]  You.
[3981.54 --> 3982.76]  You received so many.
[3982.96 --> 3983.82]  Good things.
[3983.90 --> 3984.58]  In Lazarus.
[3984.64 --> 3984.84]  Here.
[3984.92 --> 3985.12]  He.
[3985.12 --> 3986.32]  He got the bad end.
[3986.34 --> 3986.96]  Of the stick.
[3987.54 --> 3988.22]  And now.
[3988.30 --> 3989.14]  He's comforted.
[3989.30 --> 3990.30]  And you're in agony.
[3991.56 --> 3991.78]  So.
[3992.04 --> 3992.22]  Just.
[3992.48 --> 3993.36]  Keep that in mind.
[3993.60 --> 3993.62]  And.
[3994.58 --> 3995.58]  Besides that.
[3997.52 --> 3998.52]  There's this big.
[3999.18 --> 3999.70]  Chasm.
[3999.70 --> 4002.40]  And we can't go to you.
[4002.56 --> 4003.62]  And you can't.
[4003.86 --> 4004.20]  Come.
[4004.76 --> 4005.08]  Over.
[4005.76 --> 4006.44]  To us.
[4008.10 --> 4009.30]  Well as we said.
[4009.40 --> 4010.24]  Maybe this story.
[4010.42 --> 4011.00]  Isn't meant.
[4011.00 --> 4012.16]  As a precise.
[4013.20 --> 4013.84]  Description.
[4014.28 --> 4014.72]  Of heaven.
[4014.86 --> 4015.34]  And hell.
[4015.48 --> 4016.04]  But Jesus.
[4016.56 --> 4018.22]  Is teaching us.
[4018.38 --> 4018.62]  Here.
[4018.76 --> 4019.66]  A few things.
[4019.98 --> 4020.42]  Namely.
[4020.52 --> 4021.28]  There is.
[4022.20 --> 4023.14]  There is.
[4023.26 --> 4023.82]  A heaven.
[4025.00 --> 4026.42]  And there is.
[4026.92 --> 4027.40]  A hell.
[4029.70 --> 4030.20]  A heaven.
[4030.20 --> 4030.70]  A heaven.
[4030.70 --> 4031.16]  A heaven.
[4031.16 --> 4032.64]  And he is.
[4032.64 --> 4033.82]  Teaching us.
[4034.02 --> 4035.32]  That this life.
[4035.74 --> 4036.18]  Is.
[4036.50 --> 4037.56]  A test.
[4038.40 --> 4039.28]  For the one.
[4039.36 --> 4039.76]  To come.
[4041.66 --> 4043.34]  And when all is said.
[4043.42 --> 4043.88]  And done.
[4046.16 --> 4047.32]  There is.
[4047.50 --> 4048.44]  No going back.
[4050.06 --> 4051.12]  There is.
[4051.34 --> 4052.08]  In the scriptures.
[4052.08 --> 4052.84]  For us.
[4052.88 --> 4053.46]  Eternally.
[4053.56 --> 4054.00]  No.
[4054.44 --> 4054.96]  Plan.
[4055.62 --> 4055.92]  B.
[4055.92 --> 4056.52]  No.
[4056.52 --> 4056.92]  No.
[4056.92 --> 4057.92]  No.
[4057.92 --> 4058.76]  No.
[4058.76 --> 4059.28]  Second.
[4059.28 --> 4060.04]  Chances.
[4060.04 --> 4060.96]  After.
[4060.96 --> 4062.06]  The funeral.
[4063.10 --> 4063.86]  No.
[4063.86 --> 4064.34]  Court.
[4064.40 --> 4064.50]  Of.
[4064.50 --> 4065.20]  Appeal.
[4065.20 --> 4066.40]  In hell.
[4067.40 --> 4067.66]  No.
[4067.84 --> 4068.28]  Crossing.
[4068.40 --> 4068.72]  Over.
[4069.20 --> 4070.30]  To the other side.
[4074.82 --> 4075.78]  We.
[4076.04 --> 4076.28]  Do.
[4076.60 --> 4077.02]  Really.
[4077.50 --> 4078.00]  Well.
[4078.44 --> 4078.98]  To let.
[4079.46 --> 4079.84]  These.
[4080.10 --> 4080.74]  Truth.
[4081.14 --> 4081.72]  Sink.
[4082.26 --> 4082.56]  In.
[4082.56 --> 4082.62]  In.
[4085.92 --> 4088.80]  The rich man.
[4088.80 --> 4089.04]  Now.
[4089.16 --> 4089.66]  Gets it.
[4093.10 --> 4093.56]  And.
[4093.68 --> 4094.70]  They got to give this to him.
[4094.70 --> 4096.08]  He's a bit of a family man.
[4098.16 --> 4098.62]  Well.
[4098.72 --> 4098.96]  Given.
[4099.14 --> 4099.20]  As.
[4099.36 --> 4100.28]  I'm stuck.
[4101.28 --> 4102.60]  What about my family?
[4102.70 --> 4103.06]  I got.
[4103.24 --> 4103.52]  These.
[4103.80 --> 4104.12]  These.
[4104.34 --> 4104.72]  These.
[4104.72 --> 4105.30]  These brothers.
[4106.36 --> 4106.84]  And.
[4106.84 --> 4107.66]  They're down there.
[4107.76 --> 4107.84]  And.
[4107.86 --> 4108.04]  They're.
[4108.14 --> 4109.12]  They're like me.
[4109.46 --> 4109.72]  And.
[4109.82 --> 4110.80]  They need to know.
[4110.98 --> 4111.18]  About.
[4111.40 --> 4111.76]  This.
[4112.88 --> 4113.34]  So.
[4113.48 --> 4114.32]  I beg you.
[4114.58 --> 4114.98]  You know.
[4114.98 --> 4115.90]  Send.
[4116.56 --> 4117.00]  Lazarus.
[4117.00 --> 4118.12]  To my family.
[4118.56 --> 4119.78]  To my five brothers.
[4120.44 --> 4120.64]  And.
[4120.70 --> 4121.22]  Have him.
[4121.78 --> 4122.46]  Warn them.
[4122.58 --> 4125.00]  So that they won't come to this place of torment.
[4126.66 --> 4128.32]  The tone of defensiveness.
[4129.02 --> 4130.56]  Because he's really saying.
[4130.64 --> 4130.82]  You know.
[4130.86 --> 4131.90]  If I'd have known this.
[4132.02 --> 4132.14]  Well.
[4132.50 --> 4133.72]  I'd have done different.
[4136.34 --> 4136.82]  Hindsight.
[4137.28 --> 4137.68]  2020.
[4138.04 --> 4138.48]  We say.
[4139.24 --> 4139.48]  Well.
[4139.52 --> 4139.86]  At least.
[4140.00 --> 4140.96]  Give my family.
[4141.08 --> 4141.98]  A set of lenses.
[4141.98 --> 4143.96]  So that they can have some foresight.
[4143.96 --> 4148.16]  Might say.
[4148.28 --> 4149.36]  If I may speak lightly.
[4149.58 --> 4151.38]  If you send Lazarus down there.
[4151.52 --> 4151.68]  They'll.
[4151.76 --> 4153.42]  He'll scare the hell out of them.
[4153.48 --> 4154.96]  And they'll jump as high as heaven.
[4157.62 --> 4158.14]  Well.
[4158.30 --> 4160.30]  The possibility of that happening.
[4160.30 --> 4161.04]  Says Abraham.
[4161.04 --> 4162.72]  Is pretty low.
[4164.30 --> 4165.26]  Not likely.
[4166.34 --> 4167.42]  In fact.
[4167.54 --> 4168.66]  This is interesting.
[4168.66 --> 4170.62]  When Jesus spoke this parable.
[4170.72 --> 4172.66]  Maybe that's why he uses his name.
[4172.66 --> 4175.74]  He had already raised Lazarus.
[4175.74 --> 4176.50]  From the dead.
[4178.94 --> 4180.26]  And the Pharisees.
[4180.38 --> 4181.50]  When they had seen that.
[4181.82 --> 4183.56]  Got all the angry with Jesus.
[4184.70 --> 4186.38]  And were all the more determined.
[4186.38 --> 4187.40]  To put him to death.
[4187.40 --> 4193.96]  Well.
[4196.08 --> 4198.00]  What does Moses say.
[4198.14 --> 4198.32]  I mean.
[4198.38 --> 4199.42]  Abraham say.
[4199.62 --> 4200.38]  In response.
[4200.48 --> 4201.38]  To this request.
[4201.50 --> 4202.46]  To send Lazarus.
[4202.54 --> 4202.68]  Well.
[4202.76 --> 4203.52]  They have Moses.
[4203.52 --> 4204.34]  And the prophets.
[4206.92 --> 4208.30]  Let them listen to them.
[4210.36 --> 4211.24]  You might say.
[4211.32 --> 4213.04]  We got a pocket Old Testament here.
[4213.16 --> 4215.02]  Start handing out pocket Old Testaments.
[4215.78 --> 4216.66]  That'll set you.
[4216.66 --> 4217.14]  Do it.
[4218.82 --> 4220.22]  To which the rich man.
[4220.44 --> 4220.90]  Replies.
[4221.08 --> 4222.46]  Because he knew his Old Testament.
[4222.62 --> 4222.76]  No.
[4222.88 --> 4223.68]  Father Abraham.
[4224.82 --> 4226.70]  If someone comes from the dead.
[4228.22 --> 4229.58]  They will repent.
[4230.86 --> 4231.72]  Quite a word.
[4231.96 --> 4233.02]  They will repent.
[4234.02 --> 4234.80]  What's needed.
[4236.52 --> 4237.60]  But then Abraham.
[4237.84 --> 4238.92]  Gets in the last word.
[4239.04 --> 4239.78]  In this parable.
[4240.38 --> 4240.66]  No.
[4242.44 --> 4243.04]  You know what.
[4243.06 --> 4244.00]  If they don't have any use.
[4244.00 --> 4244.54]  For Moses.
[4244.54 --> 4244.56]  For Moses.
[4244.56 --> 4244.60]  For Moses.
[4244.60 --> 4245.28]  For the prophets.
[4245.28 --> 4245.48]  For the prophets.
[4245.48 --> 4245.50]  For the prophets.
[4247.28 --> 4248.68]  They won't be convinced.
[4248.88 --> 4249.66]  Even if someone.
[4249.66 --> 4250.72]  Raises from the dead.
[4255.50 --> 4256.66]  It's true today.
[4256.66 --> 4259.14]  We live in a world.
[4259.14 --> 4260.42]  That likes evidence.
[4263.38 --> 4265.88]  Some people need to be reasoned into the faith.
[4266.10 --> 4267.58]  But most in our generation.
[4267.78 --> 4268.92]  They like to be wowed.
[4271.20 --> 4272.72]  You can talk forever.
[4272.94 --> 4274.60]  Words don't seem to have much.
[4275.10 --> 4275.58]  Much.
[4276.22 --> 4276.78]  Punch.
[4277.00 --> 4277.50]  But boy.
[4277.62 --> 4279.24]  Show me something spectacular.
[4280.64 --> 4282.02]  That's why we love movies.
[4282.02 --> 4283.38]  That are powerful.
[4284.04 --> 4285.38]  Or big shows.
[4285.38 --> 4289.12]  Something that will get to us.
[4289.26 --> 4290.30]  And shake us.
[4293.10 --> 4295.46]  But what will it really take.
[4295.64 --> 4297.48]  To have us repent of our sin.
[4298.48 --> 4299.96]  And follow Jesus.
[4301.10 --> 4303.14]  And forever change our ways.
[4306.74 --> 4309.06]  You know in our pleasure seeking world.
[4309.98 --> 4313.40]  Where both legal and illegal drugs.
[4313.40 --> 4315.86]  Are numbing so many minds.
[4315.86 --> 4318.56]  To the reality of what's happening.
[4319.40 --> 4322.54]  Words have less and less power.
[4324.12 --> 4330.14]  And even if in our so called scientific day.
[4330.64 --> 4333.76]  Where science seems to have so much power.
[4334.12 --> 4337.40]  If someone came back from the dead.
[4337.40 --> 4342.74]  Would that convince the spiritual skeptics.
[4342.74 --> 4343.86]  Would that convince the spiritual skeptics.
[4347.24 --> 4348.24]  No.
[4348.40 --> 4349.02]  Says Abraham.
[4349.92 --> 4352.06]  It will only affect those.
[4352.20 --> 4354.06]  Who like the disciples of Jesus.
[4355.06 --> 4358.06]  Are eager to know God.
[4359.06 --> 4360.86]  And follow his word.
[4363.18 --> 4363.86]  Obey him.
[4363.86 --> 4368.82]  Jesus came back from the dead.
[4371.52 --> 4372.74]  Startled the disciples.
[4373.64 --> 4374.38]  That's for sure.
[4375.64 --> 4378.02]  His resurrection is what jump started.
[4378.16 --> 4379.66]  The New Testament church.
[4380.94 --> 4383.68]  But it only started among those.
[4383.68 --> 4385.84]  Who had a hunger for God.
[4386.32 --> 4387.54]  And his word.
[4388.08 --> 4389.40]  And who were looking for him.
[4389.40 --> 4393.06]  They were open to God.
[4396.56 --> 4398.06]  Do you hunger for God?
[4400.52 --> 4402.36]  Do you want to know his word?
[4402.92 --> 4404.26]  What's the truth of life?
[4405.44 --> 4406.36]  How do I live?
[4409.70 --> 4411.66]  It's all summed up in Jesus.
[4413.42 --> 4415.32]  All you need to know about God.
[4416.40 --> 4416.92]  Jesus.
[4417.08 --> 4418.58]  The one speaking the parable.
[4419.40 --> 4421.58]  And they couldn't see it.
[4422.96 --> 4424.24]  Do you see it?
[4425.24 --> 4428.28]  Or are you waiting to be wooed?
[4429.68 --> 4431.22]  Somehow surprised?
[4433.74 --> 4436.14]  The only wooing Jesus does.
[4436.78 --> 4438.02]  Or God does rather.
[4438.26 --> 4439.46]  Is through his son Jesus.
[4440.56 --> 4442.76]  Who is the fulfillment of Moses.
[4443.18 --> 4444.28]  And the prophets.
[4444.28 --> 4448.14]  And today we have the life.
[4448.24 --> 4449.82]  And the stories of Jesus.
[4451.32 --> 4453.46]  We know he's the resurrected one.
[4454.46 --> 4455.82]  We have his spirit.
[4457.06 --> 4459.64]  We have the testimony of the church of Christ.
[4459.64 --> 4461.54]  Over these past 20 centuries.
[4461.84 --> 4463.46]  All of its ups and downs.
[4463.56 --> 4464.40]  And its sufferings.
[4464.50 --> 4465.24]  But the church.
[4465.62 --> 4467.92]  Has continued to be sustained.
[4467.92 --> 4470.82]  What more do we need.
[4471.38 --> 4472.84]  To stir our soul.
[4473.88 --> 4475.46]  Than the message.
[4475.98 --> 4476.74]  Of Jesus.
[4478.04 --> 4479.16]  And who he is.
[4479.34 --> 4481.34]  As a fulfillment of God.
[4482.94 --> 4485.34]  If that message of the gospel.
[4485.70 --> 4486.86]  Will not soften.
[4486.86 --> 4488.48]  Our hearts.
[4488.70 --> 4491.10]  No angel visitation.
[4491.10 --> 4492.68]  Or family member.
[4492.80 --> 4494.74]  Coming back from the dead.
[4495.72 --> 4497.66]  Will cause us to repent.
[4499.16 --> 4501.66]  And that's why the best thing we can do.
[4501.82 --> 4502.72]  For our family.
[4503.58 --> 4504.88]  If we want them.
[4504.96 --> 4505.76]  Like this man.
[4505.90 --> 4506.80]  To get to heaven.
[4507.72 --> 4509.22]  Is to share with them.
[4509.54 --> 4511.02]  The word of God.
[4511.86 --> 4513.00]  In both word.
[4513.82 --> 4515.38]  And deed.
[4515.38 --> 4518.14]  That's why.
[4519.02 --> 4520.74]  It's so valuable.
[4521.02 --> 4522.52]  That we teach children.
[4522.68 --> 4523.42]  The stories.
[4523.56 --> 4524.46]  Of the scriptures.
[4525.78 --> 4527.20]  And in the process.
[4527.92 --> 4529.78]  Make the story of God.
[4529.90 --> 4530.62]  And who he is.
[4530.74 --> 4531.84]  Come alive for them.
[4531.88 --> 4532.62]  As it is.
[4533.06 --> 4533.70]  We trust.
[4534.44 --> 4535.14]  For us.
[4537.86 --> 4538.70]  I'm told.
[4538.82 --> 4539.94]  I don't know much about him.
[4540.94 --> 4542.54]  That it was stories like that.
[4542.62 --> 4543.70]  That changed the life.
[4543.70 --> 4545.14]  Of Dr. Albert.
[4545.38 --> 4546.06]  Schweitzer.
[4546.20 --> 4547.14]  He was a very.
[4547.74 --> 4548.94]  Rich man.
[4550.76 --> 4551.62]  Enjoying the.
[4552.12 --> 4552.56]  Lucrative.
[4553.08 --> 4553.56]  Academic.
[4553.90 --> 4554.22]  World.
[4554.56 --> 4555.04]  Of Europe.
[4555.26 --> 4556.52]  And he went to Africa.
[4557.60 --> 4558.28]  To care.
[4558.82 --> 4559.74]  For the poor.
[4560.04 --> 4561.78]  Who he came to see.
[4562.90 --> 4564.12]  Were the Lazarus.
[4564.46 --> 4565.36]  At his gate.
[4567.16 --> 4568.96]  The word of God can do that.
[4569.30 --> 4570.24]  As it did to him.
[4571.90 --> 4572.52]  But does that mean.
[4572.52 --> 4573.72]  We need to go to Africa.
[4574.02 --> 4574.58]  It might.
[4575.38 --> 4577.50]  But what it does mean.
[4577.64 --> 4578.00]  Is that.
[4578.84 --> 4579.96]  We're to listen.
[4580.06 --> 4581.14]  As best we can.
[4581.28 --> 4582.10]  For the voice.
[4582.44 --> 4583.54]  Of the master.
[4584.44 --> 4585.70]  Who's always eager.
[4586.14 --> 4586.64]  To help.
[4587.14 --> 4587.72]  The poor.
[4589.32 --> 4590.26]  And as.
[4590.52 --> 4590.64]  Is.
[4590.72 --> 4591.06]  Is.
[4591.26 --> 4591.46]  Pray.
[4591.62 --> 4591.78]  That.
[4592.18 --> 4592.38]  You know.
[4592.38 --> 4592.52]  What.
[4593.04 --> 4594.02]  It's not always.
[4594.02 --> 4595.22]  It's complicated.
[4595.22 --> 4596.34]  Helping the poor.
[4596.34 --> 4596.74]  Today.
[4596.90 --> 4597.92]  Who are the poor.
[4598.96 --> 4599.88]  Among us.
[4601.20 --> 4601.72]  Particularly.
[4601.72 --> 4602.98]  In North America.
[4603.64 --> 4604.32]  It is as.
[4605.06 --> 4606.54]  As Jesus saying.
[4606.70 --> 4607.76]  Blessed are the poor.
[4608.26 --> 4608.96]  In spirit.
[4611.02 --> 4612.38]  Many are filled.
[4612.38 --> 4613.88]  With material things.
[4615.28 --> 4616.56]  But they're searching.
[4616.56 --> 4617.32]  And lost.
[4617.32 --> 4618.80]  They're very poor.
[4618.80 --> 4620.50]  In here.
[4622.56 --> 4623.80]  Let me conclude.
[4624.26 --> 4625.08]  By asking.
[4625.46 --> 4626.08]  What we did.
[4626.18 --> 4626.88]  At the beginning.
[4628.56 --> 4629.68]  What do you think.
[4629.76 --> 4630.32]  Happens.
[4630.72 --> 4631.66]  When you die.
[4633.44 --> 4634.50]  Do you believe.
[4634.50 --> 4634.98]  In life.
[4634.98 --> 4635.64]  After death.
[4637.02 --> 4637.96]  In heaven.
[4639.70 --> 4640.78]  And in hell.
[4640.78 --> 4640.90]  Well.
[4641.90 --> 4643.28]  And do you think.
[4643.72 --> 4644.70]  That how we live.
[4644.78 --> 4645.40]  In this life.
[4645.48 --> 4646.20]  Actually makes.
[4646.36 --> 4646.84]  Difference.
[4647.56 --> 4648.02]  For the one.
[4648.10 --> 4648.44]  To come.
[4651.16 --> 4652.28]  The poorest.
[4652.50 --> 4652.94]  Person.
[4653.14 --> 4653.74]  Is the one.
[4653.92 --> 4654.92]  Who does not know.
[4655.04 --> 4655.52]  God.
[4656.08 --> 4656.82]  And Jesus.
[4657.64 --> 4658.76]  Whom he has sent.
[4661.18 --> 4662.50]  It does a person.
[4662.62 --> 4663.22]  Little good.
[4663.42 --> 4663.94]  To live.
[4664.02 --> 4664.68]  And die.
[4665.78 --> 4666.80]  Well fed.
[4668.38 --> 4669.40]  The person.
[4669.56 --> 4670.24]  Best off.
[4670.24 --> 4670.94]  Is the one.
[4670.94 --> 4671.80]  Whose heart.
[4673.00 --> 4674.40]  Has been shaped.
[4674.80 --> 4675.48]  Softened.
[4675.62 --> 4676.28]  Redeemed.
[4677.28 --> 4677.96]  By the.
[4678.22 --> 4678.96]  Loving heart.
[4679.02 --> 4679.56]  Of God.
[4681.52 --> 4682.98]  But loveless.
[4684.10 --> 4685.40]  Hard hearted.
[4685.82 --> 4686.30]  Folk.
[4687.48 --> 4688.76]  Have no future.
[4689.34 --> 4689.94]  With God.
[4691.52 --> 4692.96]  It is the pious.
[4693.88 --> 4694.50]  Loving.
[4696.46 --> 4697.52]  Soft hearted.
[4698.52 --> 4699.56]  Yet firm.
[4699.56 --> 4700.16]  Hearts.
[4701.16 --> 4702.24]  Able to repent.
[4702.24 --> 4702.86]  Of sin.
[4704.74 --> 4705.78]  Seek Christ.
[4707.28 --> 4708.68]  And then serve others.
[4708.94 --> 4709.90]  That are rewarded.
[4709.90 --> 4710.66]  With the gift.
[4711.42 --> 4712.52]  Of eternal life.
[4714.72 --> 4716.14]  Jesus is the way.
[4717.38 --> 4718.06]  And the way.
[4718.06 --> 4718.86]  We live.
[4718.86 --> 4719.98]  In this life.
[4720.12 --> 4720.82]  Either with.
[4720.82 --> 4721.98]  Or without him.
[4721.98 --> 4722.98]  Will determine.
[4722.98 --> 4723.78]  Will determine.
[4723.78 --> 4724.58]  What happens.
[4724.58 --> 4725.88]  When we die.
[4727.46 --> 4728.80]  Pray with me.
[4730.26 --> 4731.04]  Oh Lord Jesus.
[4731.04 --> 4731.72]  Thank you.
[4731.86 --> 4732.48]  For coming.
[4733.76 --> 4734.86]  For calling us.
[4736.86 --> 4738.02]  This story.
[4738.02 --> 4738.80]  Leaves us.
[4738.80 --> 4739.94]  With sometimes.
[4739.94 --> 4740.94]  A mixture.
[4740.94 --> 4742.30]  Of feelings.
[4742.30 --> 4742.96]  Because.
[4742.96 --> 4745.18]  We can find.
[4745.18 --> 4745.20]  We can find.
[4745.20 --> 4745.80]  Ourselves.
[4745.80 --> 4747.00]  In the shoes.
[4747.00 --> 4748.32]  Of that wealthy person.
[4748.56 --> 4748.72]  We.
[4748.96 --> 4749.76]  We know.
[4749.76 --> 4750.78]  That we've walked.
[4751.00 --> 4751.82]  And driven by.
[4751.96 --> 4752.32]  People.
[4752.48 --> 4753.26]  That needed help.
[4755.98 --> 4756.76]  Help us.
[4756.76 --> 4757.18]  To see.
[4757.18 --> 4757.78]  Lord Jesus.
[4757.78 --> 4758.78]  That first of all.
[4759.34 --> 4760.56]  We need help.
[4761.14 --> 4762.30]  I need help.
[4763.30 --> 4764.66]  We need you.
[4764.66 --> 4767.62]  And as you fill us.
[4767.62 --> 4768.72]  With your spirit.
[4769.72 --> 4770.90]  With the richness.
[4770.90 --> 4771.72]  Of yourself.
[4773.46 --> 4774.96]  You by your spirit.
[4774.96 --> 4775.92]  Equip us.
[4776.40 --> 4777.06]  To share.
[4777.64 --> 4778.96]  All our riches.
[4779.90 --> 4780.84]  Who we are.
[4781.02 --> 4782.64]  And what we have.
[4783.74 --> 4784.82]  With others.
[4787.02 --> 4788.58]  Continue to soften.
[4788.76 --> 4789.34]  Our hearts.
[4790.58 --> 4791.70]  Help us to see.
[4792.40 --> 4793.26]  What you see.
[4793.62 --> 4794.52]  In this world.
[4794.66 --> 4797.06]  And to respond.
[4797.96 --> 4799.06]  As you would have us.
[4799.16 --> 4799.76]  Respond.

[4808.58 --> 4809.86]  And your will be done.
[4810.26 --> 4810.96]  Through us.

[4813.16 --> 4814.00]  Until we come.
[4814.12 --> 4815.00]  To be with you.
[4815.92 --> 4816.74]  In eternity.
[4817.38 --> 4818.34]  In Jesus name.

[4839.74 --> 4840.92]  Take my life.
[4840.92 --> 4843.88]  And let it be.
[4843.88 --> 4854.22]  Take my life.

[4855.86 --> 4858.00]  And let it be.
[4858.00 --> 4863.84]  consecrated Lord to thee.
[4863.84 --> 4869.68]  Take my moments and my days.
[4869.68 --> 4875.46]  Let them flow in endless praise.
[4875.46 --> 4881.80]  Let them flow in endless praise.
[4881.80 --> 4883.80]  Take my life.

[4900.50 --> 4906.42]  Every power as thou shalt choose.
[4906.42 --> 4913.06]  Every power as thou shalt choose.
[4913.06 --> 4920.28]  Take my will and make it thine.
[4920.28 --> 4926.14]  It shall be no longer mine.
[4926.14 --> 4928.92]  Take my heart.
[4928.92 --> 4932.16]  It is thine own.
[4932.16 --> 4937.60]  It shall be thy royal throne.
[4937.60 --> 4944.14]  It shall be thy royal throne.
[4945.82 --> 4952.58]  Take my love, my Lord, I pour.
[4952.58 --> 4953.58]  Thou, I pour.
[4953.58 --> 4958.58]  Let thy feet its treasure store.
[4958.58 --> 4965.04]  Take myself and I will be.
[4965.04 --> 4971.06]  Ever only all for thee.
[4971.06 --> 4977.54]  Ever only all for thee.
[4977.54 --> 4991.84]  Ever only all for thee.
[4991.84 --> 4995.88]  Ever only all for thee.
[4995.88 --> 4997.54]  Thank you for leading us in worship.
[5000.04 --> 5004.12]  The words, particularly in the first number of songs,
[5004.12 --> 5008.42]  were very helpful in preparing my heart for bringing the word.
[5008.42 --> 5009.80]  So thank you for that.
[5009.80 --> 5012.16]  It's good to worship together.
[5012.16 --> 5016.20]  It's good to be reminded of who our Lord Jesus is.
[5016.20 --> 5020.58]  And as I was standing after the message thinking,
[5020.58 --> 5027.96]  wow, I hope you heard not just the cutting edge of the word,
[5028.10 --> 5033.44]  but that you also heard from Jesus this call to come to him,
[5033.44 --> 5034.68]  who is life.
[5035.94 --> 5040.22]  I trust that for most of us, you walk with the Lord Jesus.
[5041.10 --> 5045.80]  You have this assurance that you're headed to the right place.
[5046.52 --> 5050.46]  If you're not, get right with God.
[5050.60 --> 5051.32]  Find someone.
[5052.74 --> 5053.74]  Make it right.
[5054.80 --> 5056.10]  Know who Christ is.
[5056.86 --> 5058.66]  Because he wants to be with you.
[5059.44 --> 5060.84]  He wants to bless you.
[5060.84 --> 5063.24]  He wants to walk with you.
[5064.76 --> 5068.06]  So go into this day, this week, whatever it is that brings,
[5068.74 --> 5071.72]  knowing that that's who Christ is, the one who walks with you.
[5072.28 --> 5073.96]  And the Lord bless you and keep you.
[5074.38 --> 5077.48]  The Lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[5077.84 --> 5080.22]  The Lord turn his face right in your direction
[5080.22 --> 5083.58]  and give you his grace, his joy, and his peace,
[5084.14 --> 5085.60]  to which we God's people say,
[5085.60 --> 5086.64]  Amen.
[5086.64 --> 5086.80]  Amen.
[5087.62 --> 5088.76]  feel free from you and see you.
[5088.76 --> 5088.86]  Let's pray now.

[5246.74 --> 5249.90]  and make me willing and ready
[5249.90 --> 5255.20]  Even when I can't see my way through
[5255.20 --> 5261.74]  From now on to always live for you
[5261.74 --> 5270.08]  I am not my own
[5270.08 --> 5272.74]  But belong

[5312.74 --> 5316.74]  Christ my Lord
[5316.74 --> 5330.74]  I am not my own
