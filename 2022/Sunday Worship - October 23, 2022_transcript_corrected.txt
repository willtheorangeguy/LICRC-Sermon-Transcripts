[459.96 → 461.96] Thank you.
[461.96 → 463.96] Thank you.
[463.96 → 472.26] And lastly, just a reminder for high school-aged youth, you have HCBC tonight here at the church.
[472.44 → 480.44] And so that starts at some time. I don't know offhand. Someone help me? Seven? Don't quote me.
[480.58 → 485.16] You know when it is if you're supposed to be here. If you don't, talk to me after, and I'll figure it
[485.16 → 492.50] out for actualities then. Let's stand together, and we can worship our God as we gather in his
[492.50 → 503.32] presence. Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son,
[503.32 → 509.20] and our Saviour through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[509.20 → 509.30] Amen.
[515.02 → 522.60] Psalm 18 welcomes us this morning, looking at our call to worship and praising our Lord.
[522.60 → 531.12] I will love thee, O Lord, my strength. The Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, my God, my strength,
[531.58 → 539.04] in whom I will trust. My buckler and the horn of my salvation and my high tower. I will call upon the
[539.04 → 545.60] Lord who's worthy to be praised. So shall I be saved from mine enemies. For thou wilt light my candle.
[545.60 → 552.38] The Lord my God will enlighten my darkness. The Lord live, and blessed be the rock, and let
[552.38 → 554.68] the God of my salvation be exalted.
[554.68 → 584.66] I will call upon the Lord who is worthy to be praised. So shall I be saved from my enemies.
[584.66 → 609.66] The Lord live, and blessed be the rock, and let the God of my salvation be exalted. The Lord live, and blessed be the rock, and let the God of my salvation be exalted.
[609.66 → 631.66] The Lord will enlighten my life. I will call upon the Lord who is worthy to be praised. So shall I be saved from my enemies.
[631.66 → 641.66] The Lord live, and blessed be the rock, and let the God of my salvation be exalted.
[641.66 → 653.66] The Lord live, and blessed be the rock, and let the God of my salvation be exalted.
[653.66 → 683.64] Thank you.
[683.66 → 694.06] O power of all peace,
[694.06 → 701.16] upon all nature and all three things,
[701.82 → 708.84] upon all wisdom and all the ways of man,
[708.84 → 715.84] you hear the Father will be there.
[715.84 → 722.84] Above all kingdoms, above all truth,
[722.84 → 729.84] above all wonders, the world has never known,
[729.84 → 737.84] above all wealth, the treasures of the earth.
[737.84 → 744.84] There's no way to ensure what pure world.
[744.84 → 752.84] Close to pride, laid behind the stone,
[752.84 → 759.84] you live to die, protected and alone,
[759.84 → 766.84] like a rose trampled on the ground.
[766.84 → 773.84] It's a work of joy, with God and me,
[773.84 → 780.84] above all.
[780.84 → 788.84] Above all powers, above all needs,
[788.84 → 794.84] above all nature and all three things,
[794.84 → 803.84] above all wisdom and all the ways of man,
[803.84 → 809.84] you are given for the world to care.
[809.84 → 816.84] above all kingdoms, above all worlds,
[816.84 → 824.84] above all wonders the world has ever known,
[824.84 → 831.84] above all wealth and treasures of the earth.
[831.84 → 834.84] above all passing and waits for the earth,
[834.84 → 836.84] above all Tom't fighting on the ground.
[836.84 → 838.84] I come alive.
[842.26 → 842.84] Crucify.
[844.68 → 846.84] Leave me like a song.
[848.06 → 851.22] You live to die.
[851.70 → 855.84] Rejected and not like the rose.
[857.22 → 859.84] Trampled on the ground.
[861.32 → 862.60] You talk about.
[862.60 → 871.60] You are the king of the Lord.
[874.60 → 875.60] Crucified.
[877.00 → 879.60] Laid behind the stone.
[880.48 → 882.60] You live to die.
[884.06 → 888.60] Rejected and not like the rose.
[888.60 → 892.60] Travelled on the ground.
[893.60 → 895.60] It's not the Lord.
[897.60 → 900.60] The Lord of me.
[901.60 → 904.60] Above all.
[904.60 → 913.60] The Lord of me.
[913.60 → 914.60] The Lord of me.
[914.60 → 915.60] Lord above all.
[916.60 → 917.60] High above all powers and kings.
[918.60 → 920.60] Above all nature and all created things.
[921.60 → 922.60] We need you every passing hour.
[923.60 → 926.60] When life is going well, we sometimes forget who you are.
[926.60 → 930.60] We forget that we need you and think we are managing on our own.
[931.60 → 934.60] Until the darkness deepens, and we see our weakness so evidently.
[935.60 → 937.60] The ebb and flow of our days have joys that come and go.
[938.60 → 941.60] And when sorrow fills our vision, the world seems void of your love.
[941.60 → 944.60] It is in these times that we give away to fear.
[945.60 → 947.60] Fear torments us and disquiets our hearts.
[948.60 → 950.60] We have fear of what's happening in our lives.
[951.60 → 952.60] Our relationships.
[953.60 → 954.60] Our families.
[954.60 → 955.60] Our jobs.
[955.60 → 956.60] Our school.
[956.60 → 957.60] Our finances.
[957.60 → 958.60] Our health.
[958.60 → 959.60] And what is happening in our world.
[960.60 → 963.60] The weight of fear puts us through a thousand griefs in our minds.
[963.60 → 966.60] O to the Lord who does not change.
[966.60 → 968.60] Make your presence known within our hearts.
[969.60 → 971.60] Turn our eyes towards the cross.
[971.60 → 973.60] Christ's victory over the grave.
[973.60 → 974.60] Abide with us, Lord.
[975.60 → 977.60] Through the cloud and through the sunshine.
[978.60 → 979.60] Abide with us.
[993.60 → 994.60] Christ's victory over the grave.
[994.60 → 995.60] Christ's victory over the grave.
[995.60 → 996.60] The darkness deepens, Lord with me, Abide with me.
[996.60 → 998.60] The darkness deepens, Lord with me, Abide.
[998.60 → 999.60] When other hands, Lord with me, Abide.
[999.60 → 1004.60] Abide with me, Abide with me.
[1004.60 → 1010.60] Abide with me, as falls, even tight.
[1011.60 → 1014.60] The darkness deepens, Lord with me, Abide.
[1014.60 → 1023.60] The darkness deepens, Lord with me, Abide.
[1023.60 → 1035.00] When other helpers fail and comforts flee,
[1036.84 → 1046.82] Help of the helpless, so abide with thee.
[1046.82 → 1060.02] Swift to its blows, ebbs of life's little day,
[1061.10 → 1070.62] Earth's joys grow dim in, glories pass away.
[1070.62 → 1083.78] Change and decay in all around I see,
[1085.14 → 1095.42] O thou who changes not, abide with me.
[1095.42 → 1109.42] I need thy presence every passing hour,
[1110.06 → 1120.42] What but thy grace can for the tempest's power,
[1120.42 → 1132.42] Who, like thyself, my guidance day can be.
[1133.78 → 1144.42] Through cloud and sunshine, O abide with me.
[1144.42 → 1157.72] I hear no call with thee and hunt to bless,
[1158.72 → 1168.42] Ills have no weight and tears forbidden us,
[1168.42 → 1179.42] Where is the sting, where is thy victory?
[1182.42 → 1192.42] Our triumph still if thou abides with me.
[1192.42 → 1204.42] Hold thou thy cross before my closing eyes,
[1204.42 → 1216.42] Shine through the gloom and point me to the sky,
[1216.42 → 1221.42] And thine's morning grace,
[1221.42 → 1227.42] And earth's pain shadows flee,
[1227.42 → 1234.42] In life, in death, O Lord,
[1234.42 → 1239.42] Abide with me.
[1239.42 → 1241.42] Soon other things are your time school,
[1241.42 → 1244.42] To be of your sovereignties,
[1244.42 → 1246.42] Love my and via rune for your protection.
[1246.42 → 1249.42] I have another day in love in his home,
[1249.42 → 1250.42] To be of your children close to the house.
[1250.42 → 1257.42] I hear my sophomore year menace in the drum,
[1257.66 → 1259.42] While you are going to die,
[1259.42 → 1260.42] I know also ye dove,
[1260.42 → 1261.42] does'thus dreams your self.
[1261.42 → 1262.76] strike the town of the castle of the queen,
[1262.76 → 1264.42] I know.
[1264.42 → 1278.60] I'm still, my soul be still, and do not fear,
[1278.60 → 1283.66] no hills of change may rage tomorrow.
[1284.52 → 1292.60] God is at your side, no longer tell,
[1292.60 → 1298.00] no fires of unexpected sorrow.
[1298.56 → 1310.66] God, you are my God, and I will trust in you and not be shaken.
[1312.26 → 1321.78] God is renewed, my steadfast spirit will be healed,
[1321.78 → 1327.74] and I will trust in you and not be shaken.
[1327.74 → 1340.74] I'm still, my soul be still, and do not believe,
[1340.74 → 1346.70] but less will rise and fleeting shadows.
[1346.70 → 1355.66] Oh, Lord, to his ways, we'll shield the pain,
[1355.66 → 1360.62] against temptations, plain and geckos.
[1361.62 → 1373.40] God, you are my God, and I will trust in you and not be shaken.
[1373.40 → 1383.36] Lord, I will be free, but steadfast spirit will be healed,
[1383.36 → 1387.36] and do not fear, and do not fear, and do not fear.
[1387.36 → 1393.32] God, you are my God, and do not fear.
[1393.32 → 1398.38] God, you are my God, and do not fear.
[1398.38 → 1406.82] God, I will trust in you and not fear, and do not fear.
[1406.82 → 1409.90] You learned in the beginning.
[1410.78 → 1415.86] Wait upon the Lord.
[1416.22 → 1419.38] And hope will rise.
[1419.38 → 1422.56] This time's a pure and pure.
[1424.04 → 1429.74] God, you are my God.
[1430.02 → 1433.96] And I will trust in you and love.
[1433.96 → 1437.64] You share them.
[1438.16 → 1443.14] Lord, you are my God.
[1443.14 → 1447.64] Blessed by spirit, you are my God.
[1448.02 → 1461.44] And I will trust in you and love.
[1461.44 → 1465.00] You share their heart.
[1465.48 → 1469.76] Lord, a peace renews.
[1469.76 → 1474.62] Blessed by spirit, you are my God.
[1474.62 → 1480.62] Blessed by spirit, you are my God.
[1480.62 → 1495.28] Let us pray for love.
[1495.38 → 1498.44] Blessed by spirit, you are my God.
[1498.58 → 1500.42] Should we pray for love?
[1500.42 → 1502.88] Blessed by spirit, you are my God.
[1502.96 → 1507.76] Vaughn
[1507.76 → 1529.76] Good morning. The collections today are for the budget and for Wagner Hill Farm. It is a faith-based recovery centre located in Langley.
[1529.76 → 1556.50] They are a working farm providing a one-year program for both men and women. Seeing people through the process with classes, counselling and rehabilitation. With work programs and also community programs. They strive to bring healing, growth and transformation on the road to recovery.
[1556.50 → 1565.38] Not all residents can afford the cost. So collections like today help those in need of the treatments offered.
[1566.28 → 1578.84] 2 Corinthians 9 7. Each one should give what they have decided in their heart to give. Not reluctantly or under compulsion. For God loves a cheerful giver.
[1579.70 → 1583.72] Next week's special offering is for seafarers ministry.
[1586.50 → 1604.50] 3 Corinthians 10 6BA Web
[1604.50 → 1611.50] and a light unto my heart
[1611.50 → 1617.50] I've heard it's a hand to my feet
[1617.50 → 1624.50] and a light unto my heart
[1624.50 → 1631.50] When I feel afraid, I think I've lost my way
[1631.50 → 1638.50] Still you're there, I'm beside you
[1638.50 → 1645.50] Nothing will appear as long to argue
[1645.50 → 1653.50] Please be near me to the end
[1653.50 → 1662.50] I've heard it's a hand to my feet
[1662.50 → 1668.50] and a light unto my heart
[1668.50 → 1675.50] I've heard it's a hand to my feet
[1675.50 → 1682.50] and a light unto my heart
[1682.50 → 1689.50] I will not forget your love for me yet
[1689.50 → 1696.50] My heart forever is lonely
[1696.50 → 1704.50] Jesus, we point mine and hold me to your side
[1704.50 → 1711.50] And I will love you to the end
[1711.50 → 1716.50] I will not forget your love for me
[1716.50 → 1721.50] My heart is a hand to my feet
[1721.50 → 1728.50] And a light unto my heart
[1728.50 → 1731.50] Lord, I will not forget your love for me
[1731.50 → 1735.50] My heart is a hand unto my feet
[1735.50 → 1741.50] And a light unto my heart
[1741.50 → 1743.50] You're a light unto my heart
[1743.50 → 1749.50] You're a light unto my heart
[1749.50 → 1765.50] Good morning, everybody. All the kids.
[1765.50 → 1768.50] If your age three up to grade four, you can come on up.
[1768.50 → 1771.50] I'm going to sit over here because it's a little squishy there today.
[1771.50 → 1773.50] So you can come this way.
[1773.50 → 1783.50] I'm going to start by telling you a little story
[1783.50 → 1788.50] of something that happened to my family a little while ago
[1788.50 → 1792.50] We were here one day, and we were playing at the playground over there
[1792.50 → 1793.50] Maybe some of you have played there
[1793.50 → 1796.50] It wasn't Sunday, it was a different day of the week
[1796.50 → 1799.50] and we brought our dog because he likes to play in the field
[1799.50 → 1803.50] And when it was time to go, we were, it was, it got a little crazy
[1803.50 → 1806.50] Sometimes when leaving the park is hard for kids and parents
[1806.50 → 1810.50] So we got into the car, we finally got all the kids in the car
[1810.50 → 1812.50] And we're like, okay, let's go, it's time to go
[1812.50 → 1813.50] And we drove down the road
[1813.50 → 1818.50] And we got about to the end of the roundabout there
[1818.50 → 1820.50] And we were like, where's the dog?
[1820.50 → 1823.50] He wasn't in the car
[1823.50 → 1826.50] And we had to turn around, drive back
[1826.50 → 1828.50] Luckily he was just running around in the field having fun
[1828.50 → 1831.50] Call the dog and go home
[1831.50 → 1833.50] It was a little bit of a mistake
[1833.50 → 1835.50] It could have been a huge mistake
[1835.50 → 1837.50] But we were lucky that he was okay and safe
[1837.50 → 1841.50] In the Bible today we are going to talk about another mistake
[1841.50 → 1844.50] It's a little, it's a bigger mistake than forgetting the dog
[1844.50 → 1847.50] But you might have heard the story
[1847.50 → 1849.50] And we're going to talk about making mistakes
[1849.50 → 1851.50] And our own mistakes
[1851.50 → 1853.50] And a mistake that happened in the Bible
[1853.50 → 1855.50] So let's take a minute to pray
[1855.50 → 1858.50] And then we'll stand up for the blessing
[1858.50 → 1861.50] Lord God, we thank you for this day
[1861.50 → 1864.50] That we can come and learn more about you
[1864.50 → 1867.50] Thank you, God that you have given us forgiveness
[1867.50 → 1870.50] And that we can bring each mistake to you
[1870.50 → 1873.50] We pray that we would have open hearts and ears
[1873.50 → 1876.50] To learn more about you today, amen
[1876.50 → 1881.50] All right, let's stand up
[1881.50 → 1883.50] All right
[1883.50 → 1891.50] The Lord be with you
[1891.50 → 1906.50] Thank you
[1906.50 → 1908.50] Thank you
[1908.50 → 1910.50] Thank you
[1910.50 → 1925.36] Good morning.
[1925.90 → 1929.52] My name is Seth, and I'm an elder here at Langley Emanuel.
[1930.10 → 1933.46] It's my privilege to be able to lead you in our church family prayer.
[1934.24 → 1940.16] Before I do, while we got the good news that God provided travelling mercies for our
[1940.16 → 1945.94] young adults when they went on their trip, we also received news this morning that Aaron
[1945.94 → 1949.30] Hansen, many of you know the Hansen family, Dr. Hansen.
[1950.08 → 1954.16] Aaron was involved in a car accident near Kamloops, and he is hospitalized.
[1955.80 → 1960.40] And the family is gathering because it appears that these may be his last moments.
[1960.40 → 1963.72] So keep them near and in your hearts and in your prayers.
[1967.50 → 1968.60] Please join me in prayer.
[1970.16 → 1983.48] God of glory, God of grace, God of justice, God of mercy, God of power and might, God
[1983.48 → 1984.80] of tenderness and love.
[1986.38 → 1991.56] It's beyond our comprehension, but you are all of these things, and we praise you.
[1991.56 → 1998.80] You are holy, awesome, and majestic, and may you be praised forever.
[2000.80 → 2006.84] We praise you for your goodness, seen in abundance this week in the beautiful fall days, including
[2006.84 → 2013.34] the prayed for rain, and in the lives of your people as you continue to inspire and sustain
[2013.34 → 2019.34] us into faithful service in all areas of life through the gift of your spirit as we are your
[2019.34 → 2020.38] body here on earth.
[2022.62 → 2027.94] We praise you for your loving care, both in how you have given us the gift of eternal life
[2027.94 → 2033.72] with you because of Jesus, and in how you are present with us even in our day-to-day experiences.
[2033.72 → 2041.00] We know that our times are in your hand, and we put our trust in you, for you are good.
[2042.46 → 2048.00] You kept Amanda safe and brought timely care to her, and we pray that you will bring continued
[2048.00 → 2048.70] healing to her.
[2048.70 → 2054.64] You protected our youth leaders and Kevin from serious harm while travelling this weekend,
[2054.84 → 2060.14] and we pray for continued healing and providence for them in their important work and in their
[2060.14 → 2060.98] travels home today.
[2063.06 → 2067.90] We thank you for our pastoral staff, and we ask for continued blessing on their work and
[2067.90 → 2072.54] on their families, and we also pray for your blessing on the interview process this week
[2072.54 → 2074.50] ahead for the Young Adult Ministry Coordinator.
[2074.50 → 2082.94] We praise you for your faithful power, which extends beyond the grave, and for how you always
[2082.94 → 2083.78] keep your promises.
[2085.64 → 2090.54] While Elsa and her family mourn the loss of her dad, we pray that your comfort will dwell
[2090.54 → 2091.66] richly with them.
[2093.50 → 2098.98] We also grieve with the Hanson family, following the news of Aaron's crash, and we pray for your
[2098.98 → 2100.62] comfort and presence to be near to them.
[2100.62 → 2109.18] We also pray for your power to extend in healing ways to John after his fall, and to all in
[2109.18 → 2112.20] our church that struggle with physical and mental health.
[2113.10 → 2116.42] Be near to those who can't be with us today because of those things.
[2118.62 → 2124.24] As Kevin, Chris, Brandon, and Aaron prepare to travel to Mexico this week, we ask that you
[2124.24 → 2127.24] bless their travels, their experiences, and their encounters.
[2127.24 → 2132.98] May this trip be encouraging, especially in the relationships we have as a part of your
[2132.98 → 2134.00] worldwide church.
[2135.24 → 2139.56] Please extend these blessings to Cameron as well as she prepares for her mission trip in
[2139.56 → 2139.70] May.
[2142.30 → 2145.10] We praise you for your sovereign rule over the world.
[2145.10 → 2151.56] Even though all creation groans for the day, you make all things new, and we see brokenness
[2151.56 → 2154.76] in our neighbourhoods and in places like Haiti and Ukraine.
[2155.48 → 2160.70] We know that you will bring justice, and we know that your heart is for the oppressed,
[2161.14 → 2162.64] the downtrodden, and the weary.
[2164.40 → 2169.24] May we follow your call to bring shalom while we await your majestic return.
[2169.24 → 2177.30] As we hear your word proclaimed today, refocus our eyes to see your kingdom come.
[2177.94 → 2179.92] In Jesus' name, amen.
[2199.24 → 2213.24] We here at Emmanuel have been in a teaching series in the book of Psalms, using the Psalms to
[2213.24 → 2218.76] explore and understand our different experiences of emotion.
[2218.96 → 2222.34] And so the series is called Faith and All Our Feelings.
[2222.34 → 2229.74] And really, just as much as we have been executing, looking at and explaining and digging into
[2229.74 → 2236.44] the truths of Scripture, we've been in that also executing our own hearts and minds right
[2236.44 → 2236.88] alongside.
[2237.88 → 2244.96] This morning, we're going to do that work through Psalm 30, in particular through a few verses
[2244.96 → 2246.34] from Psalm 30.
[2246.54 → 2251.20] And so if you have a Bible handy, I encourage you to have that open and to keep that open.
[2251.20 → 2257.16] You can also read along with me as you see it on the screen behind me.
[2257.34 → 2261.60] I'm going to read Psalm 30, verse 6 through 10.
[2264.58 → 2266.04] It's the Psalm of David.
[2266.82 → 2267.32] He writes,
[2267.32 → 2273.68] When I felt secure, I said, I will never be shaken.
[2274.64 → 2279.24] Lord, when you favoured me, you made my royal mountain stand firm.
[2279.24 → 2285.20] But when you hid your face, I was dismayed.
[2286.38 → 2288.56] To you, Lord, I called.
[2289.18 → 2291.10] To the Lord, I cried for mercy.
[2291.58 → 2295.84] What is gained if I am silenced, if I go down to the pit?
[2296.92 → 2298.52] Will the dust praise you?
[2299.20 → 2301.28] Will it proclaim your faithfulness?
[2302.28 → 2306.26] Hear, Lord, and be merciful to me.
[2306.26 → 2310.52] Lord, be my help.
[2311.24 → 2312.52] This is the word of the Lord.
[2319.82 → 2328.76] When I was younger, principally when I was a teenager, I used to love being scared.
[2328.76 → 2329.92] Right?
[2329.98 → 2333.28] And so horror movies and haunted houses, all of it.
[2333.42 → 2334.36] I loved it.
[2335.50 → 2341.80] Now, I realized that I loved it because I wasn't actually, like there was nothing to actually be afraid of.
[2342.14 → 2342.34] Right?
[2342.36 → 2343.72] There wasn't a real threat of danger.
[2343.82 → 2345.26] And so caveat all of this with that.
[2345.26 → 2351.58] One year, it was close to Halloween, a season kind of like we're in right now.
[2351.58 → 2366.00] But there was a outside the town that I grew up in, there was a farm that would convert their cornfield and their barn into like a horror maze experience.
[2366.68 → 2366.82] Right?
[2366.82 → 2376.96] And as you walked through the maze, you would end up in the barn and then there would be people and these things all set up, and they would be hiding in different boxes or around things.
[2377.04 → 2380.36] And as you walked by, they would grab you or try to pull you in.
[2380.44 → 2382.72] And the whole intent was to terrify you.
[2382.72 → 2391.20] Parts of it would be pitch black, and you had to kind of fumble your way through.
[2391.62 → 2397.92] One year, the way it ended is the last like third of the walk through the barn was just in the dark.
[2398.64 → 2399.62] You could barely see.
[2399.70 → 2402.20] And this is before all of us had cell phones in our pockets, right?
[2402.24 → 2403.58] Like I'm old enough for that to be true.
[2403.66 → 2405.50] So I didn't have a flashlight, just handy.
[2406.42 → 2408.56] And so we had to fumble our way out.
[2408.56 → 2414.50] And so you came around the last corner and then the hallway out was clear, and it was lit.
[2414.84 → 2420.40] And you could see framed like what was probably the tractor door or something like that and just the outside.
[2420.62 → 2422.90] So you were like, finally, I've made it.
[2422.98 → 2428.28] And so, you know, we and my buddies were all walking down this hallway and excited for how we've made it through.
[2428.36 → 2429.44] And all of a sudden we hear a
[2429.98 → 2433.82] and we turn around.
[2433.82 → 2442.40] And behind us, what we thought was a wall turns out to be a secret door framing a perfect pitch black rectangle.
[2443.96 → 2445.08] We kind of froze.
[2446.44 → 2447.28] And then we hear,
[2447.46 → 2456.22] Someone with a chainsaw comes running out, the biggest man I have ever seen in my entire life,
[2456.60 → 2462.40] waving a chainsaw around, running after us with the hockey mask on, like the old Jason hockey masks, right?
[2462.40 → 2464.36] And he comes barrelling after us.
[2464.50 → 2467.82] And we scream, and we got out of there as fast as we possibly could.
[2469.26 → 2469.70] Terrified.
[2473.20 → 2474.62] Now fast-forward a couple of years.
[2476.50 → 2480.74] Our church youth group was in Niagara Falls on Clifton Hill.
[2480.88 → 2484.04] If you're familiar with that, there are all sorts of tourist areas and traps.
[2484.28 → 2487.38] And the youth decided that they wanted to go through a haunted house.
[2487.38 → 2490.50] And so we went through a haunted house.
[2490.68 → 2492.94] And the experience was similar.
[2493.20 → 2497.06] You, at the end, had to walk through a narrow hallway that was pitch black.
[2497.22 → 2499.60] And people would reach out and grab you.
[2499.68 → 2501.28] And I wasn't scared.
[2502.24 → 2503.32] It didn't phase me.
[2503.44 → 2505.42] Now, the youth that we were with, some of them were screaming.
[2505.84 → 2506.42] Maybe I was old.
[2506.48 → 2509.46] Maybe I just didn't care and knew that it was safe.
[2509.66 → 2513.46] And so, but people behind me yelled,
[2513.66 → 2515.02] Someone touched my hand!
[2515.02 → 2518.34] And so then I turned around to see what was going on.
[2518.44 → 2521.58] And someone grabbed my hand from behind a curtain.
[2522.14 → 2525.26] And instinctively, without thought, I just turned around and went,
[2525.42 → 2531.06] straight into the curtain where I assumed the centre of mass for that person would be.
[2531.34 → 2534.76] And as I did that crunch, it was a brick wall.
[2535.90 → 2537.24] I thought I broke my hand.
[2538.20 → 2541.68] Point is, two different responses to fear.
[2541.68 → 2542.16] Right?
[2543.54 → 2545.94] Flight or fight.
[2547.08 → 2548.90] Now, in the end, both were kind of stupid.
[2549.78 → 2551.94] And there was no real fear there.
[2552.02 → 2554.02] Or no real need to be afraid there.
[2554.70 → 2558.16] Now, as we talk about fear this morning, because that's where we're at,
[2558.42 → 2560.30] there's fight and flight.
[2560.38 → 2563.38] And there's also a third way that people might respond.
[2563.48 → 2564.72] That's sometimes called freeze.
[2565.22 → 2565.42] Right?
[2565.48 → 2567.04] So fight, flight, or freeze.
[2567.04 → 2567.48] Right?
[2567.48 → 2568.08] Right?
[2568.24 → 2571.60] Like a deer in the headlights of a car in oncoming traffic.
[2571.92 → 2572.10] Right?
[2572.20 → 2576.98] You are terrified, and cannot move or act in any meaningful way.
[2577.04 → 2582.02] Even though your mind is racing and telling you to jump, you just don't.
[2582.02 → 2592.82] Now, as we talk about fear this morning, I want to recognize that sometimes our fears are real.
[2593.78 → 2595.04] Sometimes they're less so.
[2595.88 → 2599.04] Sometimes the response of fear is good.
[2599.16 → 2599.30] Right?
[2599.36 → 2603.38] Like in the case of being attacked, fleeing, that's a good response.
[2603.38 → 2610.70] I want us to focus in our hearts and imaginations on the not so good or the less good.
[2612.02 → 2616.66] And so our life is full of fears.
[2617.40 → 2617.86] Right?
[2617.94 → 2623.26] And we might experience that fear under a variety of names or a variety of levels or ways.
[2623.36 → 2629.68] We might think about that as nervousness or worry or anxiety or terror or even horror.
[2629.68 → 2630.12] Right?
[2631.02 → 2640.50] But fear, in its sort of basic sense, is the response to a threat of danger.
[2641.36 → 2646.38] And then fear is animated as flight or fight or freeze.
[2646.50 → 2647.94] Now, let me be clarifying.
[2648.04 → 2649.42] Here's just a bit of psychology.
[2649.92 → 2650.00] Right?
[2650.08 → 2655.14] That freezing can show up in us in what's called under-functioning.
[2655.52 → 2655.74] Right?
[2655.74 → 2659.54] Which does you don't do much of anything, or you don't do anything at all.
[2659.54 → 2661.08] That's a literal sense of freezing.
[2661.48 → 2665.20] But also, freezing can show up in what is called ca retaking.
[2666.38 → 2666.82] Right?
[2666.86 → 2670.08] Which is sort of micromanaging the little things that we can control.
[2671.68 → 2677.66] So it doesn't particularly matter if the danger is real or if it's perceived or if it's exaggerated.
[2678.50 → 2678.62] Right?
[2678.62 → 2689.00] But fear is rooted in our experience of control or particularly the lack of control.
[2689.54 → 2696.30] Fear is rooted in a threat to our experience of control.
[2696.30 → 2707.40] Now, like I said, fear is a sort of umbrella term that encapsulates within it worry and nervousness and angst and terror.
[2708.44 → 2716.04] You will recall that alongside of the Scripture, we are working through the book, Allende and Longman, The Cry of the Soul.
[2716.04 → 2722.20] They help us see our emotions more clearly and learn how to handle them with the gospel.
[2723.70 → 2727.16] In their book, The Cry of the Soul, they say,
[2727.58 → 2730.50] Worry and fear are first cousins.
[2730.50 → 2739.08] Different people fear different things with different levels of intensity, but all of us fear what we cannot control.
[2740.90 → 2747.12] And so fear is that almost natural response to uncertainty.
[2747.64 → 2749.10] Uncertainty of our resources.
[2749.10 → 2761.18] Fear is the response when we are overcome by something, whether it's a force or a situation, whatever it is, when we experience helplessness, or we are unable to control.
[2762.22 → 2764.96] Fear is a response to a threat, right?
[2765.00 → 2769.54] Whether it's real or perceived, whether it is physical, emotional, or relational.
[2769.54 → 2781.26] It is uncertainty and the lack of or the loss of or the realization of the loss of control that makes us afraid.
[2782.74 → 2785.36] David knows that in this psalm as he writes.
[2785.44 → 2787.54] You see that in Psalm 30.
[2788.26 → 2790.34] Look at verse 6 again.
[2792.44 → 2798.92] When I felt secure, I said, I will never be shaken.
[2799.54 → 2802.14] If we could paraphrase that, right?
[2802.36 → 2805.68] When everything was good, everything was good.
[2806.90 → 2812.32] And when everything was good, everything only would be good.
[2812.94 → 2815.62] He says, I will never be shaken.
[2816.84 → 2823.00] And then he goes on, Lord, when you favoured me, you made my royal mountain stand firm.
[2823.00 → 2832.52] Now, David's kingdom is first established in Jerusalem or becomes the city of Jerusalem.
[2832.64 → 2835.82] Jerusalem is also known as the city of David, right?
[2835.86 → 2839.20] It's the city on top of a mountain sort of in central Israel.
[2839.32 → 2841.82] Actually, the mountain is Mount Moriah.
[2842.36 → 2845.72] Now, you might know that from the story of Abraham and Isaac, right?
[2845.76 → 2848.24] Where Abraham takes Isaac up a mountain.
[2848.40 → 2850.00] That's the same mountain.
[2850.00 → 2857.24] Mount Moriah, the city of Jerusalem, is also where in the next generation, David's son Solomon would build the temple.
[2858.90 → 2863.42] And so, if you take what David says here in a literal sense,
[2864.10 → 2872.48] he's saying that God has established his kingdom and will uphold it as an everlasting covenant,
[2872.64 → 2876.36] as a promise for all time, which, of course, is what God did.
[2876.36 → 2876.66] Right?
[2876.66 → 2877.26] Right?
[2877.28 → 2879.98] He made that promise to David in 2 Samuel 7.
[2880.84 → 2886.88] But if we take that literal meaning and then fill it up or spill it out in a metaphorical sense,
[2887.76 → 2891.46] it also means that God has given him security.
[2891.68 → 2894.06] God has held him secure more generally.
[2895.08 → 2895.40] Right?
[2895.46 → 2896.76] He's held him fast.
[2897.48 → 2902.24] That God's favour makes David feel secure.
[2904.44 → 2905.84] Now, make sure you hear that, right?
[2905.84 → 2908.08] God's favour makes him feel secure.
[2908.22 → 2912.96] And I state that again because, and I'll do this quickly because it's not the main point for us,
[2913.02 → 2914.14] but it's a good reminder.
[2915.08 → 2915.18] Right?
[2915.76 → 2919.46] David rightly knows that God's favour makes him secure,
[2920.40 → 2924.74] but the inverse isn't necessarily true.
[2926.36 → 2927.30] You follow that?
[2927.84 → 2927.98] Right?
[2927.98 → 2928.02] Right?
[2928.06 → 2932.82] So, meaning just because you feel secure or just because you have a lot of stuff,
[2933.04 → 2936.68] that doesn't mean you have God's favour, at least not necessarily.
[2938.44 → 2938.60] Right?
[2938.64 → 2940.76] And in the extreme form of that way of thinking,
[2941.10 → 2944.36] we end up getting to the place where we don't need God's favour
[2944.36 → 2946.48] because you've already got it on your own.
[2947.18 → 2947.36] Right?
[2947.36 → 2948.40] You've already figured it out.
[2948.64 → 2949.42] You've already earned it.
[2949.42 → 2955.52] David, however, recognizes that when,
[2955.76 → 2959.36] that he is secure because of God's favour.
[2960.04 → 2960.80] So David says,
[2960.80 → 2963.66] When I felt secure, I thought it would be forever.
[2964.30 → 2964.60] Right?
[2964.68 → 2967.20] When God favoured him, David was immovable.
[2967.66 → 2970.90] When things felt under control, he was all right.
[2971.32 → 2978.60] But now, he recalls a time when the secure ground beneath him shook.
[2979.80 → 2982.96] When the mountain trembled.
[2983.68 → 2985.80] Notice the end of verse 7.
[2985.80 → 2993.80] But when you hid your face from me, I was dismayed.
[2995.56 → 3002.82] Now, remember that God's turning his face toward you is a symbol for his presence,
[3003.20 → 3004.54] his grace, and his peace.
[3004.88 → 3008.86] And this comes from the priestly blessing in Numbers 6, 24 to 26.
[3008.98 → 3009.98] We've seen this a couple of times.
[3009.98 → 3015.60] And so, when David says that God's face is hidden from him,
[3015.80 → 3019.14] what he means is God's presence, his grace, and his peace,
[3019.26 → 3023.14] his favour and security are no longer felt.
[3023.98 → 3027.48] It feels like God is in control, and neither is David.
[3028.50 → 3030.36] And so, what does the text say?
[3031.12 → 3033.08] I was dismayed.
[3034.00 → 3035.88] He feels dismayed.
[3035.88 → 3040.80] Now, dismay is one of those words that, I mean, I could ask you,
[3040.84 → 3042.70] when was the last time you used the word dismay?
[3043.86 → 3044.92] Probably not regularly.
[3045.14 → 3048.90] It's not a word we ordinarily use in our language anymore.
[3049.10 → 3051.12] And to be honest, even as I think about it,
[3051.80 → 3054.00] it sort of seems a little bit sanitized.
[3054.52 → 3056.32] Like, we're not sure what it means.
[3056.38 → 3059.20] But the word that David uses is anything but.
[3059.20 → 3064.04] The word that he uses means to tremble inwardly,
[3064.20 → 3066.78] to shake with fear, right?
[3066.78 → 3067.60] To be terrified.
[3068.78 → 3072.26] Have you ever had a moment like that where you just have no idea what's going on
[3072.26 → 3078.94] and you just can't seem to control your visceral physiological reaction?
[3079.28 → 3080.56] That's what David is feeling.
[3082.16 → 3083.84] He has no control.
[3083.84 → 3088.14] And it seems to him as though God has no control.
[3088.66 → 3090.40] And there's danger all around him.
[3090.54 → 3091.40] It's physical danger.
[3091.52 → 3092.48] There's relational danger.
[3092.68 → 3093.78] There's real danger.
[3093.92 → 3095.26] And there's perceived danger.
[3095.60 → 3097.14] And so, he is terrified.
[3098.20 → 3099.22] He is afraid.
[3101.02 → 3103.78] And this goes a level deeper for him, too.
[3105.26 → 3107.54] In recalling his prayer,
[3108.56 → 3110.72] in his recalling this circumstance,
[3110.72 → 3112.82] he remembers his prayer.
[3113.84 → 3114.84] In verse 8,
[3114.94 → 3116.48] To you, Lord, I called.
[3116.88 → 3119.62] To the Lord, I cried for mercy.
[3119.94 → 3121.46] And he prays, and he pleads,
[3122.04 → 3124.62] What is gained if I am silenced?
[3124.92 → 3126.48] If I go down to the pit?
[3127.00 → 3128.64] Will the dust praise you?
[3128.90 → 3130.94] Will it proclaim your faithfulness?
[3133.08 → 3136.80] Do you remember that in Genesis 3,
[3137.70 → 3140.60] after the rebellion of Adam and Eve in the garden,
[3140.60 → 3142.88] The snake has deceived them?
[3142.88 → 3144.58] And they've rebelled against God.
[3144.64 → 3145.78] And God comes to Adam.
[3146.78 → 3147.84] And he says,
[3148.66 → 3150.02] In part,
[3151.06 → 3152.26] For dust you are,
[3153.26 → 3155.58] And to dust you will return.
[3156.96 → 3158.52] Even to this day,
[3158.90 → 3160.36] At a committal service,
[3160.52 → 3162.50] At a funeral or an interment,
[3162.58 → 3163.98] Where the casket or the urn
[3163.98 → 3165.98] Is being placed into the ground,
[3165.98 → 3168.24] The pastor might stand and pray,
[3168.40 → 3169.32] Something like,
[3169.76 → 3172.26] We commit this body to the ground.
[3172.66 → 3173.64] Earth to earth,
[3174.30 → 3175.18] Ashes to ashes,
[3175.88 → 3177.62] Dust to dust.
[3179.92 → 3183.36] David is recalling a fear of death.
[3184.50 → 3188.20] A fear of the experience of death.
[3188.70 → 3190.08] Looming before him,
[3191.16 → 3192.24] Happening around him.
[3192.24 → 3195.36] He feared death.
[3195.52 → 3199.00] And he doesn't hide that fear from God.
[3200.66 → 3203.92] Let's not miss the truth here,
[3204.02 → 3206.80] The deeper and more comprehensive truth.
[3206.94 → 3210.00] Because death is a physical reality,
[3210.26 → 3212.16] But it also is symbolic,
[3212.48 → 3214.70] And it is present in so much more.
[3214.92 → 3216.68] We feel death,
[3216.78 → 3217.64] And we fear it,
[3217.86 → 3218.94] When the things,
[3219.08 → 3219.78] Or the dreams,
[3219.90 → 3220.48] Or the people,
[3220.66 → 3221.64] Or the ideas,
[3221.64 → 3225.22] That have been core to our identity,
[3225.72 → 3226.54] Are taken away.
[3227.44 → 3228.16] Are threatened.
[3229.84 → 3229.98] Right?
[3230.24 → 3231.74] To take that away,
[3231.88 → 3234.00] Is a euphemism that we use for death,
[3234.12 → 3235.04] All the time.
[3236.12 → 3236.28] Right?
[3236.36 → 3238.50] OMA was taken from us.
[3239.92 → 3240.14] Right?
[3240.18 → 3243.10] My job was taken from me.
[3244.98 → 3248.20] These little experiences of death,
[3248.82 → 3250.80] Bring fear.
[3252.46 → 3252.76] Again,
[3253.70 → 3254.98] Allende and Longman,
[3255.04 → 3255.92] They summarize it,
[3256.28 → 3256.86] And they say,
[3257.64 → 3258.82] We want control,
[3259.56 → 3260.68] We hate failure.
[3261.74 → 3265.28] And the more we sense the possibility of personal or physical death,
[3265.38 → 3266.86] The greater our helplessness.
[3267.28 → 3267.52] Therefore,
[3267.68 → 3270.00] The more impotent we see ourselves,
[3270.36 → 3272.60] The greater our fear.
[3272.60 → 3276.12] And so,
[3276.20 → 3277.26] What are we supposed to do with that?
[3278.30 → 3282.44] What do we do with these kinds of fears?
[3283.66 → 3283.78] Right?
[3283.82 → 3284.00] And so,
[3284.06 → 3284.24] Again,
[3284.30 → 3284.70] I'll say it,
[3284.72 → 3286.98] In a sort of basic biological sense,
[3287.40 → 3289.24] Fear can be helpful.
[3289.50 → 3296.58] Fear is the trigger that causes you to run from the rock slide that's coming down the mountain that you're sleeping at the base of.
[3296.58 → 3298.02] That's good.
[3299.48 → 3299.96] Right?
[3300.10 → 3307.18] Fear is the trigger that causes you to jump in and fight when your child is being attacked by a dog.
[3307.60 → 3308.20] That's good.
[3309.82 → 3317.10] Fear is even the trigger, right, when you nest, right, to get all those things in order in your home before the baby comes.
[3317.10 → 3317.54] Right?
[3318.54 → 3321.72] That's a trigger of fear and a response of ca retaking.
[3323.50 → 3330.76] But there's also the kinds of fear that keep you stuck in your comfort zones.
[3333.08 → 3333.24] Yep.
[3333.70 → 3344.34] Almost everything that we do in this life is to increase our security and our safety and to increase our comfort.
[3344.34 → 3355.08] The entire Western social worldview is built on this value, to increase our security and to increase our comfort.
[3355.24 → 3363.90] And we manage our anxiety and our fears by knowing the limits of our comfort zone and then not going past them.
[3366.08 → 3372.02] And again, to be clear, a comfort zone in many cases is good for us and is beneficial for a time.
[3372.02 → 3373.02] Right?
[3373.02 → 3377.52] Our comfort zones can stop us from doing stupid and unwise things.
[3378.76 → 3391.04] However, getting stuck in our comfort zones can also have the impact of keeping us trapped in certain parts of life or in certain experiences of life.
[3392.22 → 3392.32] Right?
[3392.40 → 3401.02] Comfort zones, properly understood, are meant to be a sort of like porous bubble that can expand and contract as required.
[3402.02 → 3411.12] But when they become solid, they trap us in that place.
[3412.74 → 3417.44] Comfort zones can easily become walls that keep us locked in.
[3418.82 → 3427.84] Now, I've said this before, but God doesn't live in your comfort zone.
[3427.84 → 3428.84] Right?
[3428.84 → 3431.64] It's because you don't need him there.
[3432.80 → 3433.30] Right?
[3433.32 → 3436.32] When we're in our comfort zones, we've got it all figured out.
[3436.84 → 3442.08] We've set everything up perfectly to keep us secure and to keep us comfortable.
[3442.76 → 3444.02] And so we don't need God.
[3445.56 → 3445.76] Right?
[3445.76 → 3450.14] But God wants us to see that he is our security.
[3450.60 → 3452.74] That he is our comfort.
[3453.28 → 3455.46] Not the zone that you've created.
[3455.56 → 3459.08] Not the bubble of your life and experience of life.
[3459.58 → 3467.34] And so part of a life of faith, right, is walking up to the edge of your comfort zone and then seeing what happens when you take the next step.
[3467.34 → 3469.82] Because that's where God is.
[3470.90 → 3472.24] That's where you need him.
[3473.04 → 3477.30] And where you see that need and can live into that need.
[3478.98 → 3479.30] Right?
[3479.34 → 3491.28] In the case of our comfort zones, the fear that was the reason for creating it is no longer there to protect us.
[3491.28 → 3493.80] The comfort zone no longer protects us.
[3494.12 → 3496.06] It ends up imprisoning us.
[3501.68 → 3509.28] Fear also has a tendency to change the way you see the world.
[3510.44 → 3512.68] And to change the way we see ourselves in the world.
[3514.04 → 3515.36] We looked at anger previously.
[3515.82 → 3517.86] Anger makes us blame others.
[3518.48 → 3520.36] Fear makes us blame ourselves.
[3521.28 → 3532.40] And we blame ourselves, right, because even a perceived failure of ourselves is an attempt to see the world through that lens of control.
[3533.76 → 3534.24] Right?
[3534.26 → 3536.40] Because, well, I made the mistake.
[3536.76 → 3537.68] So I can fix it.
[3538.20 → 3538.40] Right?
[3538.42 → 3540.20] I can manage my fear.
[3540.58 → 3540.72] Right?
[3540.72 → 3547.34] But fear distorts our perception of the nature of the dangers that are facing us.
[3547.42 → 3549.76] It distorts our sense of reality.
[3551.28 → 3552.68] Let me give you an example of this.
[3554.14 → 3562.60] One of my favourite stories in the Bible, not because of this particular story, but because of the second part of it, is in Numbers 13.
[3563.88 → 3564.00] Right?
[3564.06 → 3565.02] It's the story.
[3566.14 → 3567.14] Let's give a context.
[3567.26 → 3570.36] So the Israelites have left Egypt.
[3570.78 → 3571.00] Right?
[3571.06 → 3572.62] They were slaves for 400 years.
[3572.76 → 3575.16] Moses comes, and he leads the people out.
[3575.16 → 3576.64] So they've left Egypt.
[3576.78 → 3579.44] That is, they've seen the ten plagues and the power of God.
[3579.56 → 3582.80] They've walked through the Sea of Reeds in the power of God.
[3582.88 → 3586.98] They've seen and won the battle with the Malecite in the power of God.
[3586.98 → 3594.84] They've seen God show up on Sinai and Moses radiate his glory from after that with lightning and thunder cracking.
[3595.32 → 3595.40] Right?
[3595.48 → 3597.54] They've seen water from a rock.
[3597.54 → 3602.00] They have seen day in and day out manna and quail as God provides.
[3602.70 → 3609.86] They have seen God go before them in a pillar of cloud and a pillar of fire for probably a year or more by this point.
[3610.06 → 3615.12] And they get to the land, the border of the land that God has promised to give them.
[3615.12 → 3620.64] And so they send 12 spies into the land to check it out.
[3620.70 → 3622.56] And the spies go in for 40 days.
[3623.56 → 3627.92] After 40 days, those spies return with their report.
[3629.06 → 3634.28] Now Caleb and Joshua, at the time young men, come back, and they say,
[3634.60 → 3635.26] We should go in.
[3635.34 → 3638.08] We should take the land because surely God is with us.
[3638.36 → 3639.46] Think of everything we've seen.
[3639.46 → 3647.82] But the rest of the spies call the people that they have explored a land of giants.
[3649.10 → 3650.16] In fact, they go even further.
[3650.32 → 3650.58] They say,
[3650.98 → 3653.24] They are descendants of fallen angels.
[3654.48 → 3655.20] And then they say,
[3656.58 → 3662.90] We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked to them the same.
[3662.90 → 3669.78] They had just spent the previous year seeing all of those amazing things from God,
[3669.94 → 3676.34] but their fear redefined reality about themselves and about God.
[3676.96 → 3682.54] Their fear turned them into grasshoppers, but also, right, even more significantly here,
[3682.64 → 3685.04] their fear turned God into a grasshopper.
[3686.38 → 3687.74] That's what fear does.
[3687.74 → 3695.24] So what does the Bible tell us to do with our fears?
[3695.90 → 3703.78] For you, now, here, where does this leave the context of this conversation and fill out to the rest of your life?
[3705.48 → 3708.92] Now, in actuality, I think the answer is pretty simple,
[3710.04 → 3714.02] but it proves to be very difficult in life.
[3714.02 → 3718.02] I think there are primarily here two answers.
[3718.78 → 3721.46] The first answer is modelled to us by David.
[3721.94 → 3722.68] David says,
[3723.18 → 3725.88] When you hid your face, I was terrified.
[3727.04 → 3730.12] To you, Lord, I called.
[3730.70 → 3733.32] To the Lord, I cried for mercy.
[3734.58 → 3738.76] I think the first answer, when we face fears, is to go to God.
[3739.18 → 3740.20] It is to pray.
[3740.52 → 3742.64] It is to come into his presence in worship.
[3742.64 → 3746.16] Our friendship is to submit ourselves to the truth of who he is, right,
[3746.20 → 3750.56] as defined by his own revelation, not by our experience of him,
[3750.74 → 3753.04] not by our experience of the world around him,
[3753.26 → 3758.04] but because, remember here, right, fear redefines our perceptions of the world,
[3758.10 → 3760.96] so we need to come to God who defines the world.
[3760.96 → 3769.34] And I get how easy that can sound.
[3770.72 → 3773.06] And I know how hard that can be to do,
[3773.68 → 3778.42] especially because in our fear, we have a tendency to isolate, right,
[3778.44 → 3782.26] to pull back from community and to pull back from God.
[3782.26 → 3787.28] But the truth is, and look around, literally look around, look beside you,
[3787.62 → 3789.46] look at the people here with you,
[3789.76 → 3793.30] because God has given you a community to be part of.
[3793.38 → 3798.54] He's given you a community to experience his presence in and through.
[3799.88 → 3804.54] God has given us brothers and sisters who will help us see our fear
[3804.54 → 3809.18] and the things that make us afraid and help us see God in the midst of them.
[3809.18 → 3813.62] God has given us brothers and sisters who will carry us when we can't carry ourselves.
[3813.80 → 3817.84] God has given us a church family through whom he gives us himself.
[3819.84 → 3823.72] And so, just as you are here called to bring your fears to God,
[3823.88 → 3827.00] bring your fears to the community in confession.
[3827.92 → 3832.96] Just as you cry out to God, cry out with your brothers and sisters in the faith.
[3834.26 → 3838.90] God promises that he will never leave us nor forsake us.
[3839.18 → 3843.94] And one of the main ways, the most concrete ways that he fulfills that promise
[3843.94 → 3845.68] is by giving you each other.
[3847.10 → 3850.12] By giving you a family to be part of.
[3851.88 → 3857.90] The reality is, there is no such thing as an individualist Christian.
[3857.90 → 3868.36] To be Christian is to belong to Christ, to be his bride, to be part of the body made up of every tribe, tongue, and nation.
[3868.50 → 3872.40] It is to stand together as the great cloud of witnesses.
[3872.98 → 3876.54] You are never alone in that.
[3876.54 → 3887.68] And the second thing the Bible tells us to do with our fear, and in our experience of fear, is to don't.
[3890.08 → 3894.18] Over and over, the Bible seems to say, just don't.
[3895.18 → 3896.12] Don't be afraid.
[3896.54 → 3897.30] Do not fear.
[3897.30 → 3903.22] In fact, because I know that some of you are going to pull me aside after if I don't mention this,
[3903.64 → 3905.92] there's an idea that goes around, right?
[3906.00 → 3908.12] And people have mentioned this to me before, that,
[3908.54 → 3910.08] do you know that the Bible says,
[3910.56 → 3913.04] do not fear 365 times?
[3913.82 → 3915.32] One for every day of the year?
[3917.24 → 3920.40] Now, I don't know where that idea comes from,
[3920.40 → 3924.12] but because I know some of us are perpetuating it,
[3924.40 → 3925.72] I did a word study this week,
[3926.28 → 3927.10] and I looked at it.
[3927.42 → 3930.36] And not to burst your meme Christian bubble,
[3931.48 → 3932.50] but it's just not true.
[3933.76 → 3933.92] Right?
[3934.04 → 3936.86] So, just be careful what you quote, right,
[3936.94 → 3940.28] as you Pinterest post your gospel summaries.
[3940.76 → 3941.36] Make sure it's true.
[3942.46 → 3945.38] Now, what I did do was explore the various ways
[3945.38 → 3948.04] that the expression, do not be afraid,
[3948.58 → 3949.70] is used in the Bible.
[3949.70 → 3952.22] And I did count over 150 times.
[3953.52 → 3953.92] Right?
[3953.98 → 3954.62] And there are different ways.
[3954.74 → 3955.58] Do not be afraid.
[3956.04 → 3956.92] Don't be afraid.
[3957.02 → 3957.64] Do not fear.
[3957.82 → 3958.80] No one to make you afraid.
[3959.34 → 3960.44] You can see them behind me.
[3960.70 → 3963.04] The numbers there are the amounts of times that they are used.
[3963.96 → 3965.36] Now, it's not 365.
[3966.16 → 3966.82] It's about 150.
[3967.42 → 3968.90] And I may have missed one or two,
[3969.08 → 3971.94] and the research that I did seem to verify
[3971.94 → 3974.06] that it numbers between 140 and 150.
[3974.74 → 3977.86] The point isn't the number.
[3977.86 → 3980.08] Remember, it's the fact.
[3981.72 → 3982.90] The Bible says,
[3983.18 → 3984.26] when we are afraid,
[3984.88 → 3985.90] to not be afraid.
[3986.64 → 3988.68] Now, again, I get that that sounds circular.
[3988.84 → 3990.06] It sounds like a tautology.
[3990.44 → 3992.76] At minimum, it sounds too easy
[3992.76 → 3995.72] or even dismissive of the real fears that we have.
[3995.72 → 3998.08] But remember, right,
[3998.32 → 4001.40] that the root of our wrong fear
[4001.40 → 4003.24] is a story,
[4003.84 → 4005.50] is a false story
[4005.50 → 4007.80] that we are telling ourselves
[4007.80 → 4009.04] about ourselves.
[4009.76 → 4010.16] Right?
[4010.16 → 4011.14] It's a false story
[4011.14 → 4012.12] that we are telling ourselves
[4012.12 → 4013.60] about our place in the world,
[4013.68 → 4015.30] about the strength of our enemies
[4015.30 → 4017.14] or the challenges that we face
[4017.14 → 4019.20] or the lack of strength that we have
[4019.20 → 4021.02] or the lack of strength that God has.
[4021.92 → 4022.04] Right?
[4022.04 → 4024.26] Fear is rooted in a false story
[4024.26 → 4025.34] that we tell ourselves.
[4025.44 → 4026.16] And so the false
[4026.16 → 4028.70] or the antidote to false stories
[4028.70 → 4030.94] is true stories.
[4032.34 → 4032.46] Right?
[4032.54 → 4035.62] Don't fear by hearing God's story,
[4035.94 → 4037.62] the true and better story,
[4037.88 → 4040.40] over and over and over again.
[4040.58 → 4042.96] And then put that in your pocket.
[4043.48 → 4043.70] Right?
[4043.78 → 4045.20] Put that in your heart.
[4045.20 → 4048.22] Let that deeply plant in who you are.
[4048.22 → 4050.82] Like, if there was ever a call
[4050.82 → 4052.94] to memorize Scripture
[4052.94 → 4054.44] and the teachings of Scripture,
[4054.68 → 4056.12] it's in the face of our fears.
[4057.18 → 4059.92] Because so easily those stories get loud,
[4060.00 → 4061.74] we need to make the gospel story louder.
[4064.06 → 4065.56] And so what is your only comfort
[4065.56 → 4067.24] in life and in death?
[4068.90 → 4069.08] Right?
[4069.12 → 4070.20] That I am not my own,
[4070.28 → 4071.94] but belong body and soul
[4071.94 → 4073.80] in life and in death
[4073.80 → 4075.76] to my faithful Saviour,
[4076.16 → 4076.96] Jesus Christ.
[4076.96 → 4079.56] that He has fully paid
[4079.56 → 4080.94] for all my sins
[4080.94 → 4081.96] with His precious blood.
[4082.02 → 4083.62] That He has set me free
[4083.62 → 4085.70] from the tyranny of the devil.
[4087.14 → 4088.92] Notice how that rightly orders
[4088.92 → 4090.40] our enemy.
[4091.62 → 4092.76] Rightly defines
[4092.76 → 4095.42] who has the power.
[4096.28 → 4098.14] He also watches over me,
[4098.22 → 4099.80] this one who defeated the devil.
[4099.80 → 4101.56] He also watches over me
[4101.56 → 4102.32] in such a way
[4102.32 → 4103.82] that not a hair can fall
[4103.82 → 4104.48] from my head
[4104.48 → 4105.52] without the will
[4105.52 → 4106.82] of my Father in heaven.
[4106.96 → 4107.80] In fact,
[4108.10 → 4109.08] all things,
[4109.56 → 4111.14] really?
[4111.96 → 4112.94] All things
[4112.94 → 4114.02] must work together
[4114.02 → 4115.58] for my salvation.
[4116.58 → 4118.22] Because I belong to Him,
[4118.42 → 4118.70] Christ,
[4118.82 → 4119.74] by His Holy Spirit,
[4120.04 → 4120.74] assures me
[4120.74 → 4121.56] of eternal life
[4121.56 → 4122.68] and makes me ready
[4122.68 → 4123.36] and willing
[4123.36 → 4124.36] from now on
[4124.36 → 4125.90] to live for Him.
[4127.38 → 4128.74] That's Heidelberg Catechism
[4128.74 → 4129.60] question and answer
[4129.60 → 4130.40] one.
[4130.40 → 4132.88] put that in your chamber
[4132.88 → 4134.50] to combat fear.
[4136.10 → 4137.62] Memorize that story,
[4137.84 → 4138.48] that truth,
[4138.54 → 4139.38] and tell it to yourself
[4139.38 → 4140.46] over and over
[4140.46 → 4141.50] and over again.
[4142.86 → 4143.32] Therefore,
[4143.54 → 4144.76] we will not fear.
[4145.44 → 4146.30] Though the earth
[4146.30 → 4147.10] give way,
[4147.46 → 4148.30] the mountains fall
[4148.30 → 4149.10] into the heart
[4149.10 → 4149.66] of the sea,
[4149.80 → 4150.58] though its waters
[4150.58 → 4151.94] roar and foam
[4151.94 → 4152.76] and the mountains
[4152.76 → 4154.32] quake with their surging.
[4154.32 → 4157.48] put that in your brain.
[4159.20 → 4159.98] Hold that
[4159.98 → 4161.08] in your heart.
[4162.42 → 4163.16] The Spirit
[4163.16 → 4164.00] that you receive
[4164.00 → 4165.36] does not make you slaves
[4165.36 → 4166.48] so that you will live again
[4166.48 → 4167.20] in fear.
[4167.92 → 4168.30] Rather,
[4168.84 → 4169.42] the Spirit
[4169.42 → 4170.62] you received
[4170.62 → 4171.48] brought about
[4171.48 → 4172.24] your adoption
[4172.24 → 4173.36] to son ship
[4173.36 → 4174.52] and by Him
[4174.52 → 4175.48] that is the Spirit
[4175.48 → 4176.16] we cry,
[4176.38 → 4176.86] Abba,
[4177.28 → 4177.82] Father.
[4177.82 → 4184.64] The antidote
[4184.64 → 4186.38] to false stories
[4186.38 → 4188.78] is a true story.
[4189.78 → 4191.30] The true story says
[4191.30 → 4192.32] there is no fear
[4192.32 → 4193.38] in love
[4193.38 → 4194.62] but perfect love
[4194.62 → 4196.10] drives out
[4196.10 → 4197.28] fear.
[4198.56 → 4200.10] I mentioned that story
[4200.10 → 4201.64] of the spies
[4201.64 → 4202.80] going into
[4202.80 → 4204.02] the land
[4204.02 → 4205.04] and coming back
[4205.04 → 4205.88] and allowing their fear
[4205.88 → 4206.66] to dictate them.
[4206.66 → 4208.14] because Caleb
[4208.14 → 4209.46] and Joshua
[4209.46 → 4210.78] were the only ones
[4210.78 → 4211.86] who faithfully said
[4211.86 → 4212.64] we can do this,
[4212.92 → 4213.58] you will recall
[4213.58 → 4214.88] the Lord said
[4214.88 → 4216.00] this generation
[4216.00 → 4216.98] will pass away
[4216.98 → 4217.62] before you
[4217.62 → 4218.90] enter into the land.
[4219.02 → 4219.84] So 40 years
[4219.84 → 4220.38] of wandering
[4220.38 → 4221.52] was the punishment
[4221.52 → 4222.70] for them making God
[4222.70 → 4223.38] a grasshopper
[4223.38 → 4224.62] for not seeing Him
[4224.62 → 4225.58] as He truly was
[4225.58 → 4226.12] in their midst
[4226.12 → 4226.90] but He said
[4226.90 → 4228.10] Joshua and Caleb
[4228.10 → 4229.44] you will get to go.
[4230.50 → 4231.08] So do a little bit
[4231.08 → 4231.62] of math here
[4231.62 → 4233.14] because it's likely
[4233.14 → 4234.22] that by the time
[4234.22 → 4234.74] the Israelites
[4234.74 → 4235.62] now come to enter
[4235.62 → 4235.96] the land
[4235.96 → 4236.76] Joshua and Caleb
[4236.76 → 4238.08] are near their 80s.
[4239.62 → 4240.52] Joshua is
[4240.52 → 4241.34] Moses' successor
[4241.34 → 4242.16] he gets to lead
[4242.16 → 4242.50] the people
[4242.50 → 4243.34] Caleb is still
[4243.34 → 4244.40] representative
[4244.40 → 4245.56] and head of his tribe
[4245.56 → 4247.82] and as that story
[4247.82 → 4248.62] comes about
[4248.62 → 4250.54] Caleb is probably 80
[4250.54 → 4252.50] and he begs
[4252.50 → 4254.42] he begs Joshua
[4254.42 → 4255.32] who's their leader
[4255.32 → 4256.70] to be the first one
[4256.70 → 4257.46] into the land
[4257.46 → 4258.88] to be the first one
[4258.88 → 4259.68] across the Jordan
[4259.68 → 4260.48] to be the one
[4260.48 → 4261.04] who marches
[4261.04 → 4261.40] at the head
[4261.40 → 4262.08] of his armies
[4262.08 → 4263.78] because he knows
[4263.78 → 4264.76] he remembers
[4264.76 → 4264.78] he remembers
[4264.78 → 4265.78] he has seen
[4265.78 → 4266.58] God show up.
[4267.52 → 4268.64] That's the faith
[4268.64 → 4269.88] of an 80-year-old
[4269.88 → 4271.02] who has rightly
[4271.02 → 4272.52] understood his fears
[4272.52 → 4273.76] and subjected them
[4273.76 → 4274.90] to who God
[4274.90 → 4276.52] truly is.
[4279.04 → 4280.58] Whether you're 14
[4280.58 → 4282.58] or 84
[4282.58 → 4286.02] hear the story
[4286.02 → 4287.78] the true story
[4287.78 → 4289.10] of who God is
[4289.10 → 4291.16] and let that
[4291.16 → 4292.72] speak power
[4292.72 → 4294.74] to the stories
[4294.74 → 4295.66] we tell ourselves
[4295.66 → 4296.24] of fear
[4296.24 → 4298.68] and let us
[4298.68 → 4299.92] like Caleb
[4299.92 → 4302.06] march into
[4302.06 → 4303.12] whatever battle
[4303.12 → 4303.96] for life
[4303.96 → 4304.54] and faith
[4304.54 → 4305.34] awaits
[4305.34 → 4306.30] and we will
[4306.30 → 4307.04] see
[4307.04 → 4308.16] God
[4308.16 → 4309.16] is
[4309.16 → 4310.26] faithful.
[4310.26 → 4312.28] we may not
[4312.28 → 4313.20] go in safety
[4313.20 → 4314.82] but we will
[4314.82 → 4315.34] go in his
[4315.34 → 4315.80] goodness
[4315.80 → 4317.32] and his
[4317.32 → 4317.86] goodness
[4317.86 → 4318.68] is worth
[4318.68 → 4319.44] more than
[4319.44 → 4320.68] any idol
[4320.68 → 4321.40] of safety
[4321.40 → 4322.50] or comfort
[4322.50 → 4323.80] you may
[4323.80 → 4324.76] have created.
[4325.24 → 4325.52] Go
[4325.52 → 4326.80] in the
[4326.80 → 4327.18] goodness
[4327.18 → 4328.74] of God.
[4329.62 → 4330.24] Do not
[4330.24 → 4331.32] be
[4331.32 → 4332.40] afraid.
[4333.10 → 4333.34] Amen?
[4334.34 → 4335.10] Let's pray
[4335.10 → 4335.44] together.
[4335.44 → 4340.28] Lord our God
[4340.28 → 4341.70] open our eyes
[4341.70 → 4343.02] open our hearts
[4343.02 → 4343.96] to the truth
[4343.96 → 4344.94] of whom
[4344.94 → 4346.30] you are
[4346.30 → 4347.60] and may the
[4347.60 → 4348.40] truth of whom
[4348.40 → 4349.02] you are
[4349.02 → 4350.16] the truth
[4350.16 → 4351.24] of your word
[4351.24 → 4352.26] also expose
[4352.26 → 4353.42] the lies
[4353.42 → 4354.76] of our fears
[4354.76 → 4358.60] and may you
[4358.60 → 4360.14] by your
[4360.14 → 4361.12] Holy Spirit
[4361.12 → 4362.02] in your
[4362.02 → 4363.10] perfect love
[4363.10 → 4364.60] drive out
[4364.60 → 4365.74] our wrong
[4365.74 → 4366.74] fears.
[4368.42 → 4369.68] So order
[4369.68 → 4370.96] our hearts
[4370.96 → 4371.84] that we
[4371.84 → 4373.22] are overwhelmed
[4373.22 → 4374.66] by whom
[4374.66 → 4375.40] you are
[4375.40 → 4376.06] and what
[4376.06 → 4377.22] you are
[4377.22 → 4377.58] doing.
[4378.54 → 4379.06] Captivate
[4379.06 → 4379.80] our hearts
[4379.80 → 4380.58] with your
[4380.58 → 4381.26] love that
[4381.26 → 4381.80] we might
[4381.80 → 4382.70] love you
[4382.70 → 4383.56] in response
[4383.56 → 4383.92] and that
[4383.92 → 4384.28] we might
[4384.28 → 4384.84] go from
[4384.84 → 4385.44] this place
[4385.44 → 4386.48] not afraid
[4386.48 → 4386.78] that we
[4386.78 → 4387.20] might go
[4387.20 → 4387.60] from this
[4387.60 → 4387.84] place
[4387.84 → 4388.48] spurred out
[4388.48 → 4388.74] of our
[4388.74 → 4389.40] comfort zones
[4389.40 → 4390.08] taking that
[4390.08 → 4390.88] step in
[4390.88 → 4391.62] faith and
[4391.62 → 4392.06] that we
[4392.06 → 4392.96] might with
[4392.96 → 4393.92] heart and
[4393.92 → 4394.36] hands
[4394.36 → 4395.18] open wide
[4395.18 → 4396.38] see you
[4396.38 → 4397.48] at work
[4397.48 → 4398.32] in the
[4398.32 → 4398.62] world.
[4399.84 → 4400.48] Go before
[4400.48 → 4400.90] us Lord
[4400.90 → 4401.54] God and
[4401.54 → 4402.56] go in
[4402.56 → 4403.18] us that
[4403.18 → 4403.74] we might
[4403.74 → 4404.52] not be
[4404.52 → 4405.44] afraid.
[4406.40 → 4406.74] In Jesus
[4406.74 → 4407.36] Christ I
[4407.36 → 4407.60] pray.
[4408.22 → 4408.56] Amen.
[4408.56 → 4408.66] Amen.
[4408.66 → 4408.68] Amen.
[4408.68 → 4408.72] Amen.
[4408.72 → 4408.76] Amen.
[4408.76 → 4408.78] Amen.
[4408.78 → 4408.80] Amen.
[4408.80 → 4410.72] Amen.
[4410.72 → 4412.66] Amen.
[4412.66 → 4412.72] Amen.
[4412.72 → 4414.72] Amen.
[4414.72 → 4416.72] Amen.
[4416.72 → 4417.72] Amen.
[4417.72 → 4418.72] Amen.
[4418.72 → 4419.72] Amen.
[4419.72 → 4420.72] Amen.
[4420.72 → 4421.72] Amen.
[4421.72 → 4422.72] Amen.
[4422.72 → 4422.76] Amen.
[4422.76 → 4423.76] Amen.
[4423.76 → 4424.34] Amen.
[4424.34 → 4427.50] Amen.
[4427.50 → 4427.58] Amen.
[4434.58 → 4436.06] Amen.
[4436.06 → 4439.14] in life and death
[4439.14 → 4443.88] Christ alone, Christ alone
[4443.88 → 4449.10] What is our holy confidence
[4449.10 → 4454.16] Matters all to Him belong
[4454.16 → 4459.46] Who holds our days within His hand
[4459.46 → 4464.22] What comes upon from His command
