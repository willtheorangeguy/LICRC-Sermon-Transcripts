[22.94 --> 29.44]  Now I'm standing with the risen king
[29.44 --> 32.16]  Staring at an empty tomb
[32.16 --> 35.20]  Jesus, you're the living proof
[35.20 --> 38.58]  There's nothing that you cannot do
[38.58 --> 42.94]  I'm ready, God, to see you go
[42.94 --> 46.42]  There's resurrection power

[269.86 --> 272.92]  Cause there's freedom, there's freedom
[272.92 --> 276.54]  I'm running out of the grave
[276.54 --> 282.78]  Sickness getting out of my way
[282.78 --> 285.94]  Let's feel it, let's feel it
[285.94 --> 289.36]  I'm running out of the grave
[289.36 --> 295.32]  Stronghold is time to break
[295.32 --> 298.48]  Let's feel it, let's feel it
[298.48 --> 302.04]  I'm dancing out of the grave
[302.04 --> 305.08]  Good morning, how's everyone doing?
[307.00 --> 310.46]  All right, we're hot and a little slow this morning
[310.46 --> 317.06]  It's a long weekend, so we've already doubled the number of people I thought we were going to have here this morning
[317.06 --> 320.24]  So excellent work, thanks for joining with us
[320.24 --> 322.86]  If you are here visiting this morning
[322.86 --> 325.42]  My name is Chris, I'm one of the pastors here
[325.42 --> 334.98]  And it's my privilege along with these others on stage and a few yet more to lead in our worship together this morning
[334.98 --> 340.38]  Before we begin, if you are visiting, we have these cards available on the back desks there
[340.38 --> 342.92]  And there's a QR code you can scan
[342.92 --> 345.38]  This is a way for us to connect with you
[345.38 --> 350.66]  And if you have anything you'd like prayer over or you have questions about faith or church or the like
[350.66 --> 357.00]  We're happy to take that and interact with you as you are able and we can together
[357.00 --> 361.36]  As well, next week in our worship together
[361.36 --> 363.94]  And this is a little bit off schedule
[363.94 --> 365.48]  So make sure that you hear this
[365.48 --> 367.68]  Next week in our worship together
[367.68 --> 369.10]  We will be having Lord's Supper
[369.10 --> 373.08]  And so that's the first Sunday of the month
[373.08 --> 375.32]  Not the second Sunday when we normally do it
[375.32 --> 378.52]  But because of vacation schedules and visiting pastors and the like
[378.52 --> 381.78]  We wanted to do that next Sunday
[381.78 --> 383.58]  So that's August 7
[383.58 --> 386.24]  August 7 we will be having Lord's Supper
[386.24 --> 389.20]  And so please spend the next week preparing your hearts
[389.20 --> 392.14]  If you have kids, talk to them about what that means
[392.14 --> 396.64]  And how we can come together as a church family at the table of our Lord
[396.64 --> 399.92]  And receive grace from Him there
[399.92 --> 404.54]  We gather to worship our God because He calls us into His presence
[404.54 --> 407.04]  And because He is here
[407.04 --> 409.62]  Where two or three are gathered
[409.62 --> 412.40]  I am there, says the Lord Jesus
[412.40 --> 415.64]  And so we are ushered into His presence by His greeting
[415.64 --> 418.24]  So I'm going to invite you as you're able to stand
[418.24 --> 423.30]  And as you stand you can take a posture of receipt
[423.30 --> 428.92]  And receive the greeting of our God as we come into His presence to worship Him
[428.92 --> 434.72]  Grace, mercy, and peace to you
[434.72 --> 439.10]  From God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ, Son and our Savior
[439.10 --> 442.30]  Through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit
[442.30 --> 443.88]  Amen
[443.88 --> 445.66]  Let's worship God this morning
[445.66 --> 449.50]  Good morning
[449.50 --> 452.68]  Our call to worship this morning comes from Psalm 73
[452.68 --> 453.92]  Where it says
[453.92 --> 456.14]  Whom have I in heaven but you?
[457.10 --> 460.18]  And earth has nothing I desire besides you
[460.18 --> 462.86]  My flesh and my heart may fail
[462.86 --> 465.62]  But God is the strength of my heart
[465.62 --> 467.32]  And my portion forever
[467.32 --> 472.68]  Let's join our voices in praise to the one who is our hope and portion forever
[472.68 --> 473.34]  This morning
[473.34 --> 493.68]  Jesus, hope of the nations
[493.68 --> 498.68]  Jesus, comfort for all who mourn
[498.68 --> 505.22]  You are the source of heaven's hope on earth
[505.22 --> 510.06]  Jesus, light in the darkness
[510.06 --> 514.44]  Jesus, truth in each circumstance
[514.44 --> 521.88]  You are the source of heaven's light on earth
[521.88 --> 526.18]  In history you lived and died
[526.18 --> 531.72]  You broke the chains you rose to lie
[531.72 --> 535.72]  You are the hope living in us
[535.72 --> 539.90]  You are the rock in whom we trust
[539.90 --> 547.72]  You are the light shining for all the world to see
[547.72 --> 551.94]  You rose from the dead conquering fear
[551.94 --> 554.10]  Our prince of peace
[554.10 --> 554.14]  Our prince of peace
[554.14 --> 556.02]  Drawing us near
[556.02 --> 558.06]  Jesus, our hope
[558.06 --> 561.98]  Living for all who will receive
[561.98 --> 566.48]  Lord, we believe
[566.48 --> 573.48]  Jesus, hope of the nations
[573.48 --> 579.32]  Jesus, comfort for all who mourn
[579.32 --> 585.86]  You are the source of heaven's hope on earth
[585.86 --> 589.86]  Jesus, light in the darkness
[589.86 --> 594.86]  Jesus, truth in each circumstance
[594.86 --> 601.86]  You are the source of heaven's light on earth
[601.86 --> 603.40]  You are the source of heaven's hope on earth
[603.40 --> 605.40]  In history you lived and died
[605.40 --> 610.40]  You broke the chains you rose to lie
[610.40 --> 615.40]  You are the hope living in us
[615.40 --> 619.40]  You are the rock in whom we trust
[619.40 --> 625.40]  You are the light shining for all the world to see
[625.40 --> 631.94]  You rose from the dead conquering fear
[631.94 --> 635.94]  Our prince of peace drawing us near
[635.94 --> 641.94]  Jesus, our hope living for all who will receive
[641.94 --> 646.48]  Lord, we believe
[646.48 --> 650.48]  Lord, we believe
[650.48 --> 651.48]  Lord, we believe
[651.48 --> 655.48]  Lord, we believe
[655.48 --> 671.02]  And we will live in us
[671.02 --> 673.02]  Lord, we believe in us
[673.02 --> 674.02]  And we will live in us
[674.02 --> 675.02]  In our hearts and hearts
[675.02 --> 675.96]  We believe in us
[675.96 --> 680.02]  We will live in us
[680.02 --> 682.02]  We will live in us
[682.02 --> 701.76]  Everyone needs compassion, a love that's never failing.
[701.76 --> 722.76]  Let mercy fall on me, everyone needs forgiveness, kindness of the Savior, the hope of nations.
[722.76 --> 743.76]  Savior, He can move the mountains, my God is mighty to save, He is mighty to save forever.
[743.76 --> 756.92]  Author of salvation, He rose and conquered the grave, Jesus conquered the grave.
[756.92 --> 785.92]  So take me as you find me, all my fears and failures, to fill my life again.
[785.92 --> 794.66]  I give my life to follow, everything I believe in.
[795.22 --> 802.62]  Now I surrender, I surrender.
[802.62 --> 821.62]  Savior, He can move the mountains, my God is mighty to save, He is mighty to save forever.
[821.62 --> 833.62]  Author of salvation, He rose and conquered the grave, Jesus conquered the grave.
[833.62 --> 838.62]  Shine your light and let the whole world see.
[838.62 --> 845.62]  We're singing for the glory of the risen King.
[845.62 --> 852.62]  Jesus, shine your light and let the whole world see.
[852.62 --> 860.62]  We're singing for the glory of the risen King.
[860.62 --> 877.62]  Savior, He can move the mountains, my God is mighty to save, He is mighty to save forever.
[877.62 --> 886.62]  Father of salvation, He rose and conquered the grave.
[886.62 --> 889.62]  Jesus conquered the grave.
[889.62 --> 908.62]  May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[908.62 --> 929.18]  There's often a temptation for us to try to make ourselves look more acceptable or a little better or feel more acceptable than we really are.
[929.18 --> 940.18]  To make ourselves look or feel worthy of Christ's love by what we do or what we do for a living or how we treat other people.
[940.18 --> 944.18]  But Paul is saying there's nothing we can boast about that comes from ourselves.
[944.18 --> 950.18]  That our only hope is in the powerful name of Jesus, His love and His sacrifice.
[950.18 --> 952.18]  Please pray with me.
[952.18 --> 970.18]  Father, will you bring to mind times when we didn't rest in the sacrifice of Jesus, when we valued our reputation in this world more than our relationship with you?
[970.18 --> 979.18]  Forgive us our selfish ways and through your Holy Spirit renew our hearts and our minds to be holy and holy.
[979.18 --> 981.18]  To be wholly devoted to you.
[981.18 --> 984.18]  You are living hope.
[984.18 --> 986.18]  Amen.
[986.18 --> 1008.18]  How great the chasm that lay between us.
[1008.18 --> 1015.18]  How high the mountain I could not climb.

[1079.32 --> 1086.14]  The God of ages stepped down from glory
[1086.14 --> 1094.08]  To wear my sin and bear my shame
[1094.08 --> 1100.54]  The cross has spoken, I am forgiven

[1408.54 --> 1414.90]  Be unto your name.
[1415.72 --> 1421.72]  Be unto your name.
[1421.72 --> 1428.72]  We are the broken, you are the healer.
[1429.86 --> 1435.86]  Jesus, Redeemer, mighty to save.
[1436.68 --> 1442.66]  You are the love song, we'll sing forever.
[1442.66 --> 1450.66]  I'll be before you, bless in your name.
[1450.66 --> 1457.66]  Holy, holy, Lord God almighty.
[1457.66 --> 1464.66]  Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy.
[1464.66 --> 1494.66] 
[1494.66 --> 1499.66]  He is not man who was saved.
[1499.66 --> 1505.66]  Highest praise and honor and glory.
[1505.66 --> 1511.66]  Be unto your name.
[1511.66 --> 1518.66]  Be unto your name.
[1518.66 --> 1525.00]  I invite you to sing.
[1541.66 --> 1548.66]  Good morning.
[1548.66 --> 1552.34]  I am asked to introduce Jim Calamance.
[1552.34 --> 1556.84]  I believe is from the food bank, Langley Food Bank.
[1556.84 --> 1558.34]  He wants to speak.
[1558.34 --> 1570.10]  Good morning.
[1570.10 --> 1570.16]  Good morning.
[1572.30 --> 1573.86]  My name is Jim Calamance.
[1573.96 --> 1575.18]  I'm from the Langley Food Bank.
[1575.56 --> 1576.12]  What an intro.
[1576.70 --> 1579.02]  First, I want to say thank you for allowing me to come.
[1579.22 --> 1579.74]  Thank you, Pastor.
[1579.74 --> 1582.20]  Also, thanks to John Stewart.
[1582.40 --> 1585.04]  John's in your group and he's one of our great volunteers.
[1585.30 --> 1586.80]  So, praise God for him.
[1587.44 --> 1588.50]  Praise the Lord for you guys.
[1588.66 --> 1590.32]  I've been at the food bank for three years now.
[1590.70 --> 1592.62]  I was a pastor for over 30 years.
[1593.12 --> 1596.26]  And I thought, gee, how could God use me after I want to be a pastor?
[1596.80 --> 1599.56]  And I found out the last three years is a great opportunity
[1599.56 --> 1603.84]  because the Langley Food Bank and the Alder Grove Food Bank are faith-based.
[1604.58 --> 1608.08]  We are one of the few that love Jesus.
[1608.08 --> 1610.62]  As a matter of fact, we're crazy about Jesus.
[1611.48 --> 1616.48]  And we want the people to know that they can also have Jesus as their Lord and Savior too.
[1616.96 --> 1620.48]  So, not only do we hand out food, that's kind of our opportunity to get into their lives.
[1621.00 --> 1624.88]  But really, the end all is for us to be able to share Christ.
[1625.62 --> 1628.20]  And so, there are two things I want to do today, just briefly.
[1628.78 --> 1632.16]  Number one, thank you so much for your latest contribution.
[1632.70 --> 1633.82]  I believe it was a couple weeks ago.
[1633.88 --> 1635.02]  I think we have a couple slides.
[1635.86 --> 1637.64]  And that's the Langley Food Bank.
[1638.08 --> 1641.66]  And then we have two slides of all the stuff you guys gave.
[1641.70 --> 1644.54]  You gave us four carts full and two bins.
[1644.68 --> 1646.98]  The next one is two bins full of food.
[1647.04 --> 1648.20]  And look how high it's stacked.
[1648.74 --> 1652.08]  And during the summer months, these are the times we need the food the most.
[1652.74 --> 1654.88]  And our number one item is pasta.
[1655.56 --> 1657.42]  And KD, that's number two.
[1657.42 --> 1661.22]  And so, for some reason, we're really short in those areas.
[1661.22 --> 1665.64]  So, as we go to the next one, I want to share how God has provided for us.
[1665.74 --> 1668.02]  This is Ben from Fresh Goal and Alder Grove.
[1668.66 --> 1670.14]  And he has a love for the community.
[1670.64 --> 1675.06]  So, when I got here three years ago, we have a lot of Muslim families that are coming now.
[1675.14 --> 1676.98]  And we were giving them ham.
[1676.98 --> 1680.16]  That's not a good thing to do with Muslims.
[1680.74 --> 1681.88]  They did not take the ham.
[1681.94 --> 1683.04]  We couldn't understand why.
[1683.28 --> 1685.10]  Well, because, of course, they don't eat ham.
[1685.56 --> 1686.08]  They eat halal.
[1686.50 --> 1688.90]  So, for the last three years, I've been getting halal chickens in.
[1689.44 --> 1691.10]  So, I always go through Ben.
[1691.18 --> 1692.12]  He gives us great deals.
[1692.64 --> 1695.62]  And so, I said, Ben, I need 65 halal chickens.
[1696.52 --> 1699.06]  Well, up the line somehow, it got changed.
[1699.24 --> 1702.40]  And I get 65 cartons of halal chickens.
[1702.58 --> 1704.94]  And each carton gets four to six chickens in each carton.
[1705.38 --> 1707.72]  So, Ben says, Jim, they made a mistake.
[1708.80 --> 1714.28]  You can pay for the 65, but they're not charging me for the other 147 halal chickens they sent you.
[1714.62 --> 1716.26]  And so, you can have them free.
[1717.46 --> 1720.02]  And I don't know if you ever bought a halal chicken, but they're expensive.
[1720.02 --> 1725.66]  So, not only did we get 500 hams or 450 hams, but we also got that.
[1725.74 --> 1727.78]  So, then Ben said, and God provided again.
[1728.10 --> 1733.38]  Ben says, I went up the line to Freshco, and I got you $6,500 worth of cards.
[1734.02 --> 1736.22]  So, it paid for the whole order for Easter.
[1736.76 --> 1737.64]  So, God is amazing.
[1738.14 --> 1743.40]  Next thing we see here is our annual pilgrimage to Toys R Us.
[1744.16 --> 1747.60]  And what we try to do is we have a toy closet at the Langley Food Bank.
[1747.60 --> 1755.24]  And when a client's child under 12 has a birthday, we actually have them, we used to have them go in and pick out a present for their child.
[1755.60 --> 1758.68]  Now, we go in and pick out two and bring out two because of COVID.
[1759.22 --> 1765.34]  And so, every year we go and we actually give them a Christmas present to each of our client's kids under 12.
[1765.34 --> 1774.18]  And so, this last year, I had two companies fighting to buy the presents for the kids.
[1774.72 --> 1782.24]  And every other year before, I always had one company step and say, you know, we're using this, we can't use it for COVID, so can we give you this $5,000?
[1782.88 --> 1784.28]  And so, we've always gone shopping.
[1784.28 --> 1789.40]  So, we go on a Sunday night, about two Sundays before Christmas, and we had about 27 volunteers there.
[1789.82 --> 1793.84]  And we got 267 presents in 65 minutes.
[1794.34 --> 1796.02]  So, that was really a great shopping spree.
[1796.12 --> 1796.82]  Everybody had fun.
[1797.20 --> 1799.60]  I heard people saying, hey, we should really get this for our grandkids.
[1800.10 --> 1803.56]  And so, it was kind of a pre-excursion into buying those presents.
[1803.72 --> 1804.16]  The next one.
[1804.16 --> 1806.34]  This is the way it is now.
[1806.42 --> 1807.24]  It's the Langley Food Bank.
[1808.26 --> 1809.66]  5768 203 Street.
[1809.80 --> 1811.08]  We're right across from the fire station.
[1811.60 --> 1815.88]  We have the Langley Hospital, Animal Hospital on one side and the cabinet place on the other.
[1816.28 --> 1817.38]  We only have 10 stalls.
[1817.56 --> 1819.82]  It's amazing we get that many cars in there at one time.
[1820.10 --> 1821.24]  But we had to bring it outside.
[1821.46 --> 1822.18]  So, we have tents.
[1822.28 --> 1822.90]  We have tables.
[1823.52 --> 1828.08]  And before, it took you 25 to 30 minutes to go through the process of getting your food.
[1828.44 --> 1830.64]  Now, it's five to seven minutes.
[1831.02 --> 1832.74]  So, we've lost the personal touch.
[1832.74 --> 1836.08]  So, now we have a church that comes in the first week of the month.
[1836.18 --> 1837.92]  They have coffee and conversation.
[1838.64 --> 1841.96]  And then on Wednesdays, we have a volunteer, an ex-pastor, who comes in.
[1842.02 --> 1846.40]  And he just kind of works the crowd and talks to people and says, hey, anything you want to pray about?
[1846.56 --> 1847.54]  Have you ever heard about Jesus?
[1848.28 --> 1850.42]  And so, that's how we've kind of adapted to that.
[1850.56 --> 1851.04]  So, next one.
[1852.02 --> 1856.92]  This is our first ever Christmas Eve service in the parking lot.
[1857.40 --> 1861.44]  So, the church that comes in for coffee and conversation, they actually helped us.
[1861.44 --> 1865.28]  We split the bill and we set up gigantic tents across our parking lot.
[1865.72 --> 1867.16]  And so, we had a service there.
[1867.22 --> 1868.28]  We had actually two services.
[1868.88 --> 1870.60]  And the gospel was presented there.
[1871.94 --> 1872.62]  Next one.
[1873.70 --> 1876.06]  That's how we want our clients to end up.
[1876.50 --> 1877.56]  In the arms of Jesus.
[1878.26 --> 1879.92]  Let me tell you this last story and then I'll go.
[1879.92 --> 1886.64]  So, and that is about a year ago, a year and a half, I had an Indo-Canadian family come in.
[1887.02 --> 1889.12]  And they had been forced out of their home.
[1890.18 --> 1893.58]  So, as I was standing there, I said to him, because I know a little bit of the culture,
[1894.36 --> 1896.00]  are the temples not helping you?
[1896.04 --> 1897.46]  He says, no, none of the temples will help me.
[1897.96 --> 1900.18]  I said, well, I know somebody who will help you.
[1900.38 --> 1901.18]  Come into my office.
[1901.78 --> 1904.58]  So, he sat down and I said, there's this person, his name is Jesus.
[1905.54 --> 1906.34]  He can help you.
[1906.96 --> 1908.14]  And he says, well, tell me more.
[1908.64 --> 1911.80]  And I just really starved for spiritual conversation.
[1911.94 --> 1913.10]  So, I shared the gospel with him.
[1913.50 --> 1916.84]  I said, you know, hey, you can make him your friend right now.
[1917.24 --> 1918.26]  He said, well, let me think about it.
[1918.64 --> 1920.06]  So, that night, it was a Friday.
[1920.18 --> 1921.68]  He went to a BC Lions game.
[1922.48 --> 1925.52]  And outside BC Lions place was a guy with a placard that says,
[1925.52 --> 1927.64]  if you want to know about Jesus, ask me.
[1928.66 --> 1932.58]  So, he went up to the guy and the guy led him to Jesus.
[1932.58 --> 1936.86]  So, they came back and I saw him a week later and he said,
[1936.94 --> 1937.72]  Jim, I have Jesus.
[1938.60 --> 1940.22]  I said, you need to come to my office.
[1940.98 --> 1944.22]  So, he came back in the office and he said, yeah, I prayed and asked Jesus in my heart.
[1944.80 --> 1945.88]  And I said, how about your wife?
[1946.42 --> 1946.64]  Nope.
[1947.02 --> 1947.78]  I said, bring her in.
[1948.30 --> 1952.14]  So, we brought her in and she asked Jesus in her heart as well that day.
[1953.04 --> 1956.72]  So, we are much more than food at the Langley and Aldergo Foodbanks.
[1957.36 --> 1958.64]  But we can't do it without you.
[1958.64 --> 1962.08]  So, thank you so much, church, for supporting us.
[1962.58 --> 1963.04]  God bless you.
[1973.92 --> 1980.22]  Today's offerings are for a manual budget for all our programs and day-to-day expenses.
[1980.22 --> 1988.76]  The second offering is for the University Campus Ministries at the University of BC in Kelowna.
[1989.60 --> 1999.20]  Christian Reformed Campus Ministries Okanagan is present at UBCO as Campus Reformed Okanagan,
[1999.92 --> 2002.44]  a ministry of the Christian Reformed Church,
[2002.44 --> 2010.02]  which seeks to be the catalyst for thoughtful Christian engagement with university culture
[2010.02 --> 2015.60]  and a platform for fostering Christian community and discipleship.
[2016.16 --> 2026.44]  It is guided by the conviction that Jesus Christ is present at UBCO to renew and reform a broken world.
[2026.44 --> 2036.92]  Please support the work of campus pastor, Reverend Dr. Todd Statham,
[2037.46 --> 2042.82]  along the students, staff, and faculty at UBCO.
[2043.34 --> 2045.42]  Give as the Lord has blessed you.
[2045.42 --> 2047.42]  Thank you.
[2047.42 --> 2049.26]  Thank you.
[2049.26 --> 2079.24]  Thank you.
[2079.26 --> 2089.44]  Faithless one, you're my rock of peace.
[2090.10 --> 2097.50]  Lord of all, I depend on you.
[2097.50 --> 2109.50]  I call out to you again and again.
[2109.50 --> 2118.50]  I call out to you again and again.
[2120.18 --> 2127.80]  You are my rock in times of trouble.
[2127.80 --> 2137.80]  You lift me up when I fall down.
[2138.80 --> 2150.80]  All through the shore, your love is the anchor.
[2150.80 --> 2159.80]  My hope is in you alone.
[2162.80 --> 2169.80]  Faithful one, so I'm changing.
[2169.80 --> 2181.80]  Faithful one, you're my rock of peace.
[2181.80 --> 2190.80]  Lord of all, I depend on you.
[2190.80 --> 2201.80]  I call out to you again and again.
[2201.80 --> 2210.80]  I call out to you again and again.
[2210.80 --> 2220.80]  You are my rock in times of trouble.
[2220.80 --> 2231.80]  You lift me up when I fall down.
[2231.80 --> 2244.80]  All through the storm, your love is the anchor.
[2244.80 --> 2252.80]  My hope is in you alone.
[2252.80 --> 2264.80]  I call out to you again and again.
[2264.80 --> 2269.62]  I'm going to invite all the kids up to the front.
[2269.80 --> 2279.46]  In particular, if you're preschool age, so it's at three to five, you can come up to the front and then you will head out for children's worship time.
[2279.46 --> 2286.46]  If you are an older kid, you can also just come up to the front and we can bless you for our worship here.
[2286.46 --> 2287.46]  Excellent.
[2287.46 --> 2288.46]  Good job.
[2288.46 --> 2292.46]  Haley, you're always so bright eye and bushy tail right up to the front.
[2293.46 --> 2294.46]  Very good.
[2295.46 --> 2302.46]  If you haven't yet, for kids who are staying here, there are clipboards at the back with some activities and coloring pages and the like.
[2302.46 --> 2306.46]  You're welcome to grab one of those before we get into the message together.
[2309.46 --> 2312.46]  Client Galtanks, look at you guys.
[2312.46 --> 2316.46]  All right.
[2316.46 --> 2325.46]  So, today you guys are going to go off to children's worship time and then the rest of us are going to stay here and continue reading some parables from Jesus.
[2325.46 --> 2329.46]  But before you go, we want to pray for you and then we want to bless you.
[2329.46 --> 2331.46]  So, can we pray together?
[2331.46 --> 2332.46]  Let's pray.
[2332.46 --> 2333.46]  Let's pray.
[2333.46 --> 2341.46]  Lord Jesus, we pray now that you would speak to these young hearts and minds.
[2341.46 --> 2346.46]  Show them your love and may they love you in return.
[2346.46 --> 2348.46]  Be with their teachers and helpers.
[2348.46 --> 2352.46]  May they have a good time in worship together learning about you.
[2352.46 --> 2354.46]  In Jesus name we pray.
[2354.46 --> 2355.46]  Amen.
[2355.46 --> 2357.46]  All right, everyone.
[2357.46 --> 2362.46]  Let's stand up and then we'll turn around and face the rest of the church.
[2362.46 --> 2367.46]  And then rest of the church, we're going to say the Lord be with you and as kids.
[2367.46 --> 2370.46]  And then you will respond and say and also with you.
[2370.46 --> 2371.46]  So, ready guys?
[2371.46 --> 2372.46]  Ready?
[2372.46 --> 2374.46]  The Lord be with you.
[2374.46 --> 2377.46]  Amen.
[2377.46 --> 2378.46]  Amen.
[2382.46 --> 2399.46]  I knew Lena was short but I didn't think you were that short.
[2399.46 --> 2405.46]  They call me short too in my family so I know how you feel.
[2405.46 --> 2406.46]  Good morning everyone.
[2406.46 --> 2407.46]  Time for some family prayer.
[2407.46 --> 2410.46]  I had some time this morning being in the nursery business.
[2410.46 --> 2414.46]  You have to get up in the mornings early and do some watering and stuff.
[2414.46 --> 2418.46]  So, when the heat's like this as it is these days, the mornings are kind of precious.
[2418.46 --> 2423.46]  So, I don't know if anyone's had a chance to get up early in the morning and feel the morning air.
[2423.46 --> 2424.46]  It's definitely refreshing.
[2424.46 --> 2427.46]  So, that was my morning or my mornings.
[2427.46 --> 2433.46]  So, for the prayer today, a couple of things I just wanted to highlight.
[2433.46 --> 2435.46]  I had a chance to talk to Harry Bauman this morning.
[2435.46 --> 2439.46]  I know many of you realize that he had quite the accident about a month ago or six weeks ago.
[2439.46 --> 2440.46]  So, I chatted with him.
[2440.46 --> 2441.46]  That was kind of a...
[2441.46 --> 2444.46]  Harry's always kind of an interesting guy to talk to.
[2444.46 --> 2446.46]  It's always a blessing to talk to him.
[2446.46 --> 2447.46]  He's always pretty positive.
[2447.46 --> 2448.46]  And this morning he was too.
[2448.46 --> 2452.46]  He's just taking it day by day.
[2452.46 --> 2455.46]  And he has a doctor's appointment this week.
[2455.46 --> 2458.46]  On Tuesday, he's getting his casts off, he said.
[2458.46 --> 2460.46]  So, they're going to check to see how the healing is going.
[2460.46 --> 2462.46]  And hopefully everything is going well.
[2462.46 --> 2464.46]  And then at that point, some more...
[2464.46 --> 2466.46]  A long road of physiotherapy.
[2466.46 --> 2469.46]  So, if you ever get a chance to talk to him, it's kind of when you like...
[2469.46 --> 2472.46]  I kind of tweaked my knee this week.
[2472.46 --> 2473.46]  And then I was feeling kind of bummed about it.
[2473.46 --> 2475.46]  And then I went and talked to Harry this morning.
[2475.46 --> 2478.46]  I realized that my life is not so bad compared to what he's going through.
[2478.46 --> 2481.46]  So, Harry's a great guy to talk to.
[2481.46 --> 2482.46]  And I was like to...
[2482.46 --> 2484.46]  Klein Gelting sitting in the back here by me.
[2484.46 --> 2487.46]  They just had a baby this week.
[2487.46 --> 2489.46]  Was it this week or last week?
[2489.46 --> 2491.46]  So, I want to congratulate them on that.
[2491.46 --> 2494.46]  So, that was a real blessing as well.
[2494.46 --> 2499.46]  The staff wanted me to let you know that if you're hot at home and you need a place to cool off,
[2499.46 --> 2500.46]  there's air conditioning in the building.
[2500.46 --> 2503.46]  Maybe not in the sanctuary as you all can tell right now.
[2503.46 --> 2505.46]  But in the rest of the building it is.
[2505.46 --> 2509.46]  But Chris does have a list, a to-do list around the building.
[2509.46 --> 2514.46]  So, if you do come here and hang it out, he's probably going to put you to work.
[2514.46 --> 2520.46]  Alright, with that we'll just begin with the family prayer.
[2520.46 --> 2524.46]  Our Father in Heaven, hallowed be your name.
[2524.46 --> 2529.46]  We thank you for this wonderful part of the world, this beautiful morning here in BC,
[2529.46 --> 2534.46]  with its beautiful landscapes of oceans, mountains and land that was created by you.
[2534.46 --> 2541.46]  Your handiwork is evident all around us, from the bees to the hummingbirds to the laughter of children.
[2541.46 --> 2547.46]  We ask, Lord, that your kingdom come and your will be done on this earth as it is in heaven.
[2547.46 --> 2553.46]  As we live our lives here on earth, Lord, we yearn for your influence to continue to spread around this world.
[2553.46 --> 2556.46]  We long for suffering and pain to be over.
[2556.46 --> 2562.46]  We long for injuries and mental health and other physical challenges to be over.
[2562.46 --> 2568.46]  We long for strained relationships and community disasters to be no more.
[2568.46 --> 2576.46]  We all have struggles in our lives that we deal with each day and every day that we long to be released from.
[2576.46 --> 2579.46]  Lord, may your kingdom come.
[2579.46 --> 2585.46]  Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our sins as we forgive those who have sinned against us.
[2585.46 --> 2589.46]  We thank you, Lord, for continuing to provide for us.
[2589.46 --> 2592.46]  We have a blessed community here at Emmanuel.
[2592.46 --> 2597.46]  We live in a great city, beautiful province and an amazing country.
[2597.46 --> 2605.46]  When we look around the world and see the atrocities that are happening, the hunger, the human rights atrocities, war,
[2605.46 --> 2609.46]  we can only be thankful for the place we are today.
[2609.46 --> 2614.46]  May your spirit work in the leaders all over the world to make peace more common,
[2614.46 --> 2619.46]  to make human rights a priority and to make hunger a thing of the past.
[2619.46 --> 2625.46]  Lord, you have blessed Langley Emmanuel with another baby born to Nathan and Maria Klein-Geltink.
[2625.46 --> 2630.46]  We look forward to seeing little Theo running around this church in a couple of years.
[2630.46 --> 2638.46]  We thank you, Lord, that many of us can take time this summer for some family time and some relaxation time while on vacation.
[2638.46 --> 2645.46]  The break from work and regular grind of life is healthy and good and we are grateful for these opportunities.
[2645.46 --> 2652.46]  Please keep those of us who are away safe on their vacation and also in their travels.
[2652.46 --> 2657.46]  Summer too, Lord, can be a reminder of lost loved ones as well.
[2657.46 --> 2662.46]  Missing loved ones from the family's summer traditions and experiences can be difficult,
[2662.46 --> 2667.46]  either due to death or those that just can't make it out for family time.
[2667.46 --> 2674.46]  So we ask, Lord, that you give peace and comfort for those who are missing loved ones at this time of the year.
[2674.46 --> 2680.46]  Lord, as we go from here today, may we be a light for you to those around us.
[2680.46 --> 2685.46]  May we share a smile or a hello to those you pass on the street.
[2685.46 --> 2690.46]  May we honour and glorify you in all we do, whether at our work or play this week.
[2690.46 --> 2691.46]  May we for our efforts to please pray to you.
[2691.46 --> 2692.46]  May we bless you, Lord.
[2692.46 --> 2693.46]  May we bless you.
[2693.46 --> 2694.46]  May we bless you, Lord.
[2694.46 --> 2695.46]  May we bless you, Lord.
[2695.46 --> 2696.46]  May we bless you, Lord.
[2696.46 --> 2697.46]  Come to us and bless you, Lord.
[2697.46 --> 2699.46]  And Lord, please help us not to be led into temptation but deliver us from the evil one.
[2699.46 --> 2700.46]  For yours is the kingdom, the power, and the glory forever and ever.
[2700.46 --> 2701.46]  Amen.
[2701.46 --> 2701.56]  Amen.
[2701.56 --> 2702.56]  Amen.
[2702.56 --> 2704.56]  Amen.
[2723.28 --> 2731.84]  With the time that remains to us this morning, we're going to spend some time in God's Word
[2731.84 --> 2732.32]  together.
[2733.32 --> 2738.52]  So if you brought a Bible with, I of course encourage you to open that up and have that
[2738.52 --> 2738.84]  with you.
[2738.92 --> 2747.82]  We're going to read in our series on parables from Matthew 25, verse 14 to the end.
[2748.68 --> 2753.26]  But in our reflections together, we'll look at some stuff from chapter 24.
[2753.26 --> 2758.08]  So I encourage you to have that with you and ready.
[2758.08 --> 2767.56]  Before I jump into the text, a little bit of a story.
[2767.70 --> 2772.82]  When I was a kid, my dad worked a lot.
[2773.74 --> 2781.98]  He was an electrician by trade, did primarily residential work, although he did work for
[2781.98 --> 2786.98]  a time with a thermodynamics company building generators and so on, or wiring them.
[2788.16 --> 2789.38]  Anyway, so let me be really clear.
[2789.44 --> 2793.92]  My dad is here this morning, so he can fact check me later if you have questions.
[2794.14 --> 2801.18]  But because my dad worked so much, we didn't, as kids, often have a lot of time hanging out
[2801.18 --> 2807.92]  or doing recreational things, except when we were building model airplanes.
[2809.32 --> 2814.86]  And as a kid, I loved building model airplanes with my dad.
[2815.64 --> 2819.38]  I remember, I think it was a, Dad, you can correct me about this one.
[2819.42 --> 2821.62]  Is it a B-17 stealth fighter?
[2822.96 --> 2824.76]  I had a, no, not a B-17.
[2824.76 --> 2827.10]  Okay, some other stealth fighter.
[2827.20 --> 2831.64]  Anyway, I had a stealth fighter that we built and we would hang from the wall or hang from
[2831.64 --> 2832.70]  the roof in my room.
[2832.84 --> 2837.58]  I remember building other fighter jets.
[2837.72 --> 2844.86]  But the one that stands out to me most clearly, and I had to look it up because all I remember
[2844.86 --> 2847.44]  that it was bright yellow and it was called the Beaver.
[2848.24 --> 2852.00]  But it's the de Havilland DH-2 yellow beaver.
[2852.00 --> 2856.24]  It was a float plane that I got to build and paint yellow.
[2856.52 --> 2858.58]  And why do I tell you this?
[2859.96 --> 2866.46]  I loved building model airplanes with my dad because we would complete the plane and I would
[2866.46 --> 2867.66]  hold it out to him.
[2867.72 --> 2871.84]  I would show it to him and he would say, good job.
[2873.42 --> 2876.06]  And I loved that.
[2876.06 --> 2892.06]  Hold that image in your mind as we read this parable, the bags of gold, from Matthew 25.
[2892.06 --> 2901.46]  Again, it will be like a man going on a journey who called his servants and entrusted his wealth
[2901.46 --> 2901.92]  to them.
[2902.92 --> 2910.40]  To one he gave five bags of gold, to another two bags, and to another one bag, each according
[2910.40 --> 2911.16]  to his ability.
[2911.68 --> 2912.94]  Then he went on a journey.
[2912.94 --> 2919.68]  The man who had received five bags of gold went at once and put his money to work and
[2919.68 --> 2921.62]  gained five bags more.
[2922.42 --> 2926.74]  So also the one with two bags of gold gained two more.
[2927.60 --> 2932.76]  But the one who had received one bag went off, dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master's
[2932.76 --> 2933.00]  money.
[2934.58 --> 2939.36]  Now after a long time, the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them.
[2939.36 --> 2944.64]  The man who had received five bags of gold brought to the other five.
[2945.52 --> 2949.56]  Master, he said, you entrusted me with five bags of gold.
[2949.80 --> 2952.08]  See, I have gained five more.
[2953.16 --> 2959.68]  His master replied, well done, good and faithful servant.
[2960.54 --> 2964.30]  You have been faithful with a few things and I will put you in charge of many things.
[2964.70 --> 2967.54]  Come and share your master's happiness.
[2967.54 --> 2996.62]  Then the man who had received one bag of gold came.
[2997.62 --> 3002.82]  Master, he said, I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and
[3002.82 --> 3004.46]  gathering where you have not scattered seed.
[3004.66 --> 3005.72]  So I was afraid.
[3005.86 --> 3008.02]  I went out and hid your gold in the ground.
[3008.56 --> 3010.84]  See, here is what belongs to you.
[3012.10 --> 3015.92]  His master replied, you wicked and lazy servant.
[3016.52 --> 3020.74]  So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed.
[3020.74 --> 3027.82]  Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers so that when I returned, I would have it back with interest.
[3028.82 --> 3032.56]  So take the bag of gold from him and give it to the one who has ten bags.
[3032.74 --> 3036.12]  For whoever has will be given more and they will have abundance.
[3036.46 --> 3041.46]  Whoever does not have when they have, even what they have will be taken from them.
[3041.46 --> 3049.80]  And throw that worthless servant outside into the darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
[3049.80 --> 3052.72]  This is the word of the Lord.
[3052.72 --> 3077.32]  As we continue in our series this summer on parables, just a quick reminder that Jesus tells us that he uses parables to teach and for instruction for two sort of main reasons.
[3077.32 --> 3083.40]  One, he's trying to make a theological point out of sort of the ordinary circumstances of life around him.
[3083.98 --> 3099.30]  But two, he talks in these ways so as to reveal to those people who know what they need to know and to confuse those people who don't know and who can't know.
[3099.30 --> 3108.40]  And so, when we dig into these parables, we've been doing the hard work of trying not to oversimplify them.
[3108.72 --> 3112.52]  Trying not to do too much of a children's Bible version.
[3113.46 --> 3117.26]  And so we're going to continue with that task today.
[3118.34 --> 3126.82]  Now the sort of theme that I want to reflect on with you this morning out of this parable is this here.
[3126.82 --> 3139.44]  When you live ready for the end, that is when your heart and your eyes and your life is fixed on the kingdom of heaven to come,
[3139.98 --> 3144.18]  far from making you aloof or distant in the world around you,
[3144.18 --> 3150.98]  you are actually made more able, more ready to live rightly now.
[3150.98 --> 3159.24]  Now the reason why I want to spend some time here, there used to be a saying that, I'm not sure if you're familiar with it,
[3159.76 --> 3169.04]  but sort of evangelical Christians used to be criticized, maybe they still are, with this phrase that says that they're too heavenly minded to be of any earthly good.
[3170.56 --> 3170.74]  Right?
[3170.76 --> 3175.44]  And so the presumption there is all they think about is heaven, so then they don't worry about what's going on around here.
[3175.44 --> 3177.20]  I want to challenge that assumption.
[3178.68 --> 3186.38]  That it's in fact by being heavenly minded, you are able to be the most good, the best good for the world around us.
[3186.64 --> 3187.40]  I'll put it this way.
[3188.82 --> 3198.60]  When this, right, all around you is all there is, you end up needing this to be everything.
[3198.60 --> 3201.10]  But it can't be.
[3201.90 --> 3202.96]  And it won't be.
[3204.50 --> 3209.46]  So here's how I see that in Matthew 25, in the parable of the bags of gold.
[3209.54 --> 3214.38]  And to get there, like I said, we need to actually go back a little bit in this text and chapter
[3214.38 --> 3218.18]  and see what's going on in the context that this parable is given.
[3219.00 --> 3222.62]  And so we're going to look at chapters 24 and 25 a little bit together.
[3222.62 --> 3228.98]  Chapters 24 and 25 are part of one long discussion about the kingdom of heaven.
[3229.32 --> 3229.42]  Right?
[3229.46 --> 3230.46]  The end of the world.
[3230.56 --> 3234.68]  About judgment, renewal, and reward, punishment.
[3235.72 --> 3241.94]  About how the truth of the kingdom of heaven and the end of the world, working backwards,
[3242.34 --> 3246.82]  impacts the priorities of your life lived right now.
[3247.66 --> 3249.52]  And so let's track that together.
[3249.52 --> 3253.48]  If you have your Bibles open, and I think this one will be on the screen, look chapter
[3253.48 --> 3256.42]  24 in verse 1.
[3257.06 --> 3263.56]  Jesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came up to him to call his attention
[3263.56 --> 3264.40]  to its buildings.
[3265.54 --> 3266.76]  Do you see these things?
[3266.84 --> 3267.34]  He asked.
[3268.12 --> 3271.88]  Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another.
[3272.18 --> 3274.60]  Every one will be thrown down.
[3274.60 --> 3283.92]  Jesus and the disciples are walking around the temple and Jesus says to them,
[3284.56 --> 3288.90]  here's how you know that it is the beginning of the end.
[3289.62 --> 3296.36]  This temple, this massive edifice and structure will be utterly destroyed.
[3296.36 --> 3304.08]  And then if you scan variously through the rest of the chapter, you will see, you know, in
[3304.08 --> 3308.42]  verse 5, many will come claiming to be the Messiah after me.
[3308.48 --> 3311.58]  And there'll be wars and rumors of wars and famines.
[3312.44 --> 3313.38]  There'll be earthquakes.
[3313.90 --> 3322.12]  In verse 15 of 24, Jesus says, you will see it standing in the holy place, the abomination
[3322.12 --> 3323.94]  that causes desolation.
[3325.28 --> 3329.04]  Now that's a particular phrase, the abomination that causes desolation.
[3329.12 --> 3336.34]  And it's actually a quote from Daniel 9, verse 27, which is an Old Testament prophet.
[3336.34 --> 3344.20]  And the chapter 9 in Daniel is one of those future prophecies about the destruction and
[3344.20 --> 3345.06]  judgment to come.
[3345.06 --> 3353.06]  But we also know that from the perspective of Daniel, right, the abomination of desolation
[3353.06 --> 3355.48]  has a fulfillment, right?
[3355.48 --> 3357.04]  You can actually map this out.
[3357.10 --> 3361.84]  And Daniel in his prophecy gives some pretty particular numbers that go along and timelines.
[3361.84 --> 3366.36]  And you can calculate it out and it actually matches with history as we know it.
[3366.36 --> 3371.60]  Because there's at least one level in which this prophecy, this abomination of desolation
[3371.60 --> 3375.22]  is fulfilled in 167 BC.
[3376.66 --> 3378.26]  It's a little bit of history for you.
[3378.34 --> 3379.50]  You guys know that I love that.
[3380.28 --> 3387.38]  In 167 BC, what was the empire, the Greek empire of Alexander the Great had been divided
[3387.38 --> 3389.32]  up among his generals and his people.
[3389.32 --> 3396.76]  And the region of Judea is called the Seleucid Empire at that point, is given and is being
[3396.76 --> 3400.36]  ruled by one Antiochus IV Epiphanes.
[3401.00 --> 3404.12]  He's king of Syria and the Seleucid division of the empire.
[3404.40 --> 3408.20]  And he captures Jerusalem and he plunders the temple.
[3409.36 --> 3414.52]  And Josephus, who's a Jewish historian from the first century, in writing out the Jewish
[3414.52 --> 3421.86]  history for his Roman patron, actually, Josephus says that Antiochus took everything from the
[3421.86 --> 3423.08]  temple, even the curtains.
[3424.22 --> 3426.80]  So we might say he took everything, including the kitchen sink.
[3428.02 --> 3431.88]  And then what Antiochus did is he sacrificed a pig.
[3433.76 --> 3439.12]  Now, like we heard for the Muslims, pigs are unclean animals for the Jews.
[3439.12 --> 3446.00]  And Antiochus sacrificed a pig on the altar in the temple and he sacrificed it to Zeus.
[3447.62 --> 3453.42]  So you can easily imagine how that would be an abomination that causes desolation for the
[3453.42 --> 3455.32]  purity of the altar.
[3456.20 --> 3463.74]  But Jesus, now jumping back to Matthew 24, Jesus, saying that they will see the abomination
[3463.74 --> 3470.64]  that causes desolation, says that there will be another, right, as yet future, from Jesus'
[3470.84 --> 3473.78]  perspective, fulfillment of Daniel 9, 27.
[3474.96 --> 3482.42]  And in fact, if we did a class on Hebrew prophecy, you would know that Hebrew prophecy can work like
[3482.42 --> 3483.12]  this, right?
[3483.16 --> 3490.24]  Here we talk about sort of horizons of fulfillment, of patterns and types as God moves history
[3490.24 --> 3491.04]  forward.
[3491.52 --> 3493.76]  What we're seeing here is an example of that.
[3494.46 --> 3496.08]  As a case in point to that, right?
[3496.42 --> 3501.34]  In verse 34, again from chapter 24, Jesus says,
[3501.34 --> 3508.44]  Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.
[3509.16 --> 3513.06]  So Jesus is putting a pretty precise time frame on what he's talking about here.
[3513.78 --> 3519.84]  And so given that time frame, given the reference to Daniel 9, the abomination that causes
[3519.84 --> 3526.40]  desolation and Jesus saying that the temple will be utterly destroyed, it seems clear that
[3526.40 --> 3532.90]  the fulfillment that Jesus is talking about, that he has in mind, is the destruction of
[3532.90 --> 3538.36]  Jerusalem, in particular the destruction of the temple that would take place in A.D. 70.
[3539.80 --> 3547.50]  Now in A.D. 70, the temple and much of Jerusalem, the city, is raised to the ground by Tacitus,
[3547.50 --> 3554.48]  whose son of Emperor Vespasian, Tacitus would become emperor after him.
[3555.24 --> 3561.98]  And again, Josephus, in recording this, Josephus was tasked by Tacitus and Vespasian to write
[3561.98 --> 3562.70]  these things down.
[3563.14 --> 3568.78]  Josephus' account of this, of the fires in the temple and in the city and of the dying screams
[3568.78 --> 3571.90]  of hundreds of thousands of Jews is truly heartbreaking.
[3571.90 --> 3576.22]  And it's truly a desolation indeed.
[3577.82 --> 3579.24]  And so why do we make this point?
[3579.32 --> 3580.80]  Why does this history matter?
[3580.88 --> 3582.82]  And I want to be really clear here.
[3583.78 --> 3593.06]  There is a sense in which the end times that Jesus is talking about in 24 and 25, there is
[3593.06 --> 3600.48]  a sense in which the end times in which Jesus is talking about, well, future to him are past
[3600.48 --> 3601.90]  to us.
[3604.04 --> 3604.56]  Right?
[3604.62 --> 3607.46]  There have been people claiming to be the Messiah.
[3607.66 --> 3614.44]  The temple at Jerusalem was utterly destroyed by Tacitus and his armies in A.D. 70, and that
[3614.44 --> 3619.52]  the generation of Jesus' audience would have been alive to witness that.
[3621.10 --> 3628.00]  And, and that's a really big and, okay, so don't miss it, and there's also a sense in
[3628.00 --> 3634.26]  which the kingdom of heaven and the end times remain future to us.
[3634.26 --> 3642.84]  Jesus says in Matthew 24, 30, then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven, and then
[3642.84 --> 3647.36]  all peoples on earth will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven
[3647.36 --> 3649.08]  with power and great glory.
[3649.46 --> 3653.84]  And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather the elect from the
[3653.84 --> 3656.80]  four winds from one end of the heavens to the other.
[3657.48 --> 3659.78]  Now that obviously hasn't happened yet.
[3659.78 --> 3660.22]  Right?
[3661.22 --> 3667.94]  In verse 36, he goes on and says, but about that day or hour, no one knows, not even the
[3667.94 --> 3670.72]  angels in heaven nor the Son, but only the Father.
[3671.80 --> 3677.94]  And again, in 42, therefore, keep watch because you do not know on what day your Lord will
[3677.94 --> 3678.26]  come.
[3679.12 --> 3684.96]  And then verse 44, so you must be ready because the Son of Man will come at an hour you do
[3684.96 --> 3686.44]  not expect him.
[3686.44 --> 3692.68]  And so on the one hand, the truth of the Bible is that the kingdom of heaven is already present.
[3694.68 --> 3695.16]  Right?
[3695.22 --> 3699.96]  In some way, this now already is the end.
[3701.10 --> 3708.22]  And, there's that big and again, and the kingdom of heaven is future, not yet to come.
[3708.22 --> 3715.24]  And so when we read parables like ours today about the kingdom of heaven as part of this
[3715.24 --> 3721.12]  long explanation of the end times, you have to read it and understand it in the context
[3721.12 --> 3729.46]  of Jesus' teaching that the kingdom is both present and current in reality and a future
[3729.46 --> 3730.54]  reality to come.
[3730.54 --> 3736.92]  And that these biblical realities come together in the heart and in the mind of the believer
[3736.92 --> 3741.86]  to form our new creation realities.
[3742.46 --> 3750.90]  Being a disciple of Jesus, believing in and by grace through faith is to be made new and
[3750.90 --> 3757.18]  is to be being made new and is to one day be made new.
[3757.18 --> 3767.66]  The fact of the present kingdom reality is a guarantee of the future kingdom reality.
[3767.66 --> 3775.92]  And that the truth of the future kingdom reality is an assurance in the midst of our present reality.
[3778.02 --> 3785.58]  And so you see, separated from this context, the parable of the talents or of the bags of gold
[3785.58 --> 3792.60]  can be manipulated or misunderstood to be about wise investment strategies.
[3792.60 --> 3794.42]  Because who doesn't want to double their investment?
[3794.42 --> 3803.60]  Right, separated from this context, this parable can be about how to use wealth properly.
[3805.04 --> 3810.76]  Cynically, this parable, separated from this context, can be read as a cautionary tale against the
[3810.76 --> 3816.72]  capitalistic structures and the unfair distribution of wealth about the rich getting rich off the backs
[3816.72 --> 3818.34]  and fears of the marginalized.
[3818.34 --> 3827.62]  Now, to be sure, I read examples this week of these interpretations of this parable.
[3828.52 --> 3835.98]  And again, to be fair, Jesus and the rest of the Bible calls us to a measure of wisdom with our finances
[3835.98 --> 3838.52]  and in our personal management in life.
[3838.52 --> 3844.14]  And we are called to protect the marginalized and to care for the least of these in our midst
[3844.14 --> 3848.28]  and to provide for them, just not from this parable.
[3850.12 --> 3850.34]  Right?
[3850.42 --> 3855.12]  That reading reduces the teaching of Jesus in this parable to a moralism.
[3855.70 --> 3860.42]  And this is a parable of the kingdom and how the promised return of the master
[3860.42 --> 3865.30]  directly impacts what kingdom life looks like right now.
[3865.30 --> 3873.18]  Like I said at the beginning, when this is all there is, you need it to be everything.
[3873.86 --> 3880.20]  And when you need this to be everything, you will live afraid to lose it.
[3881.80 --> 3885.22]  Or you will live as if it's never enough.
[3886.68 --> 3887.74]  Because it's not.
[3888.30 --> 3889.08]  And it can't be.
[3889.08 --> 3897.74]  And if that's the way you see your life and that this is everything, if you lose this, you've lost everything.
[3899.02 --> 3906.38]  When this world is all that there is, or when this world rather isn't all that there is,
[3907.40 --> 3914.40]  you can give away the things of this world for the glory of your master who will return.
[3914.40 --> 3924.94]  You can imagine followers of Jesus who are first reading the Gospel of Matthew,
[3925.04 --> 3926.98]  are first reading this account that we have here.
[3927.32 --> 3931.42]  The Gospel of Matthew was likely written sometime in the mid-60s.
[3932.30 --> 3937.34]  Now, there are modern scholars who say it was later, but they say that based on some assumptions that I don't agree with.
[3937.34 --> 3944.32]  It was likely written in the mid-60s, some 30 years after Jesus' death, resurrection, and ascension,
[3944.54 --> 3947.68]  and a few years before the destruction of Jerusalem.
[3949.00 --> 3954.82]  Now, most of these first disciples thought for sure that Jesus would return quickly.
[3955.96 --> 3956.18]  Right?
[3956.26 --> 3959.70]  The angel said, in the same way that you have seen him go, he will come back.
[3959.72 --> 3961.44]  And they thought, okay, start the clock.
[3961.44 --> 3962.04]  Right?
[3962.76 --> 3963.72]  Surely by next week.
[3964.48 --> 3968.88]  Then Pentecost happened, which was in a sense, right, the return of Jesus of the Spirit.
[3969.74 --> 3970.90]  And then they waited again.
[3971.78 --> 3977.64]  And days turned into months, turned into years, turned into decades, and the master hadn't returned.
[3978.98 --> 3984.86]  And so part of Matthew's theological purpose in including this parable and shaping these chapters
[3984.86 --> 3990.46]  the way that he has written them is to remind them, these early disciples,
[3990.60 --> 3995.32]  and to offer proof and conviction again that Jesus will return.
[3996.14 --> 3999.22]  In verse 19 of chapter 25, we read,
[3999.54 --> 4004.70]  After a long time, the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them.
[4004.80 --> 4006.32]  He is coming back.
[4006.62 --> 4007.46]  That's the guarantee.
[4008.74 --> 4011.40]  And when he does, there will be questions.
[4013.28 --> 4014.44]  There will be judgment.
[4014.86 --> 4023.30]  Now, that's a word that people in our culture, even in our churches, don't like.
[4024.64 --> 4025.12]  Judgment.
[4026.44 --> 4026.54]  Right?
[4026.62 --> 4031.28]  People bandy about the phrase, judge not lest ye be judged.
[4031.36 --> 4033.70]  And I don't mean to dismiss that because those are the words of Jesus.
[4035.10 --> 4035.26]  Right?
[4035.68 --> 4038.32]  More commonly, someone might say, who am I to judge?
[4038.32 --> 4045.06]  And yet, right, we make judgments, and we must make certain judgments.
[4045.38 --> 4051.46]  And further than that, Jesus, the master, right, God, must also make judgments.
[4051.46 --> 4058.34]  In our culture, perhaps too quickly, we correlate judgment with punishment.
[4058.34 --> 4062.28]  But in order to give a reward, you have to make a judgment.
[4063.24 --> 4067.78]  So, yes, we have judges that adjudicate in courts and hand out punishments when you've
[4067.78 --> 4068.60]  transgressed the law.
[4068.76 --> 4073.60]  But we also have judges who make decisions in sport and hand out gold medals.
[4075.12 --> 4075.22]  Right?
[4075.34 --> 4078.64]  Punishment and reward both require a judgment.
[4079.98 --> 4086.12]  Now, to be sure, right, we have to use wisdom in making judgments.
[4086.12 --> 4089.04]  We need to be slow in making judgments.
[4089.18 --> 4093.58]  We should walk a mile in the shoes of others and those with whom we are making these sorts
[4093.58 --> 4094.62]  of discernments together.
[4094.92 --> 4097.50]  And we must have a standard of accountability.
[4097.86 --> 4100.32]  We must have a structure and a rule and a purpose.
[4101.20 --> 4102.70]  And again, let's be clear, right?
[4102.74 --> 4106.10]  The Bible does say, do not judge or you too will be judged.
[4106.20 --> 4108.76]  For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged.
[4108.82 --> 4111.88]  And with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.
[4112.68 --> 4113.72]  That's Matthew 7.
[4113.72 --> 4120.98]  And Paul says in 1 Corinthians, what business of it is mine to judge those outside the church?
[4121.86 --> 4128.10]  But then Paul immediately says, are you not to judge those inside?
[4130.10 --> 4135.84]  Now, again, let's move slowly here because this can get really scary.
[4135.84 --> 4140.02]  And there are all sorts of abuses of power that are possible here.
[4140.42 --> 4145.62]  And I want to be really, really clear and hopefully in the midst of this, really, really humble.
[4146.58 --> 4153.42]  But I need you to make discernments and to make decisions and to make recognitions and, yes,
[4153.50 --> 4160.16]  even judgments about my life and about my faith and about my doctrine, about my holiness.
[4160.16 --> 4163.84]  I need you to hold me accountable to that.
[4164.64 --> 4167.92]  And in some sense, you need to make a judgment.
[4168.10 --> 4171.36]  You need to make a discernment and hold me to that standard.
[4173.06 --> 4182.28]  Now, that standard, again, needs to not be a human law or a projection of your own preferences and personal tastes.
[4182.28 --> 4182.78]  Right?
[4182.84 --> 4184.64]  You might not like the way I preach.
[4185.72 --> 4186.72]  And that's okay.
[4187.64 --> 4189.44]  We can still get along with me.
[4189.66 --> 4190.82]  But don't judge me for that.
[4191.34 --> 4192.62]  That's a preference question.
[4193.78 --> 4194.24]  Right?
[4194.46 --> 4196.98]  But judge me if I'm unfaithful to my calling.
[4197.78 --> 4199.56]  And hold me accountable to that.
[4200.68 --> 4204.96]  That the standard that we have needs to be the word of God, the holiness of God.
[4204.96 --> 4210.04]  And, yes, God calls us to a really high bar of holiness as Christians.
[4210.40 --> 4210.58]  Right?
[4210.62 --> 4212.24]  In our ethics and in our morality.
[4212.76 --> 4217.52]  But in the power of the Holy Spirit, right, living and coursing through us,
[4217.80 --> 4223.20]  we are also made able to live faithfully to that high bar.
[4223.34 --> 4226.74]  To respond in obedience to the call of God on our lives.
[4226.82 --> 4230.84]  To live even abundantly under that high bar.
[4230.84 --> 4238.24]  And when we do that together, when we make those types of properly directed and focused judgments,
[4238.54 --> 4244.02]  we are doing what the church is supposed to do together.
[4244.52 --> 4244.88]  Right?
[4244.88 --> 4247.90]  We're practicing discipline and discipleship together.
[4248.06 --> 4250.76]  And that is a good thing.
[4251.68 --> 4252.28]  Right?
[4252.32 --> 4254.70]  In calling one another back to holiness.
[4255.08 --> 4258.58]  Back to the design of God for our life and our lives together.
[4258.58 --> 4259.02]  Right?
[4259.02 --> 4263.80]  Not only are we practicing proper love, biblical love, where Jesus says,
[4263.96 --> 4267.08]  if you love me, you will keep my commandments kind of love.
[4267.38 --> 4267.56]  Right?
[4267.66 --> 4271.78]  But it's a proper outworking of the love that God has for us.
[4273.18 --> 4279.70]  And so we're also teaching each other and reminding each other to fix our eyes on Jesus,
[4279.96 --> 4282.28]  the author and perfecter of our faith.
[4282.28 --> 4287.08]  And reminding each other that Jesus will return, that the master will come back,
[4287.14 --> 4293.56]  and he will make judgments about how we have been faithful in a few things that he has given us.
[4294.12 --> 4298.98]  How we have been faithful in service to his mission in the world.
[4299.42 --> 4304.24]  How we have been faithful in seeking first his kingdom and his righteousness.
[4304.24 --> 4310.36]  How we have been faithful in proclaiming the glory of God and living for his glory together.
[4310.36 --> 4312.36]  How we have been faithful in a few things that he has given us.
[4312.36 --> 4318.00]  In 1 Peter, you can read chapter 1, verse 17.
[4319.00 --> 4322.82]  Since you call on a father who judges each person's work impartially,
[4323.32 --> 4328.04]  live out your time as foreigners here in reverent fear.
[4329.22 --> 4334.12]  Live in proper relationship and submission to who God is.
[4334.12 --> 4340.78]  Have your loves rightly ordered, your view of the world properly in balance,
[4340.92 --> 4346.22]  focusing on the kingdom of heaven as we live here and now on earth.
[4347.20 --> 4350.02]  Paul in Ephesians makes a similar point.
[4350.18 --> 4352.86]  And here he's actually speaking to slaves.
[4353.70 --> 4353.84]  Right?
[4353.98 --> 4356.04]  Slaves who had become Christians.
[4356.54 --> 4358.08]  And then he speaks to their masters.
[4358.08 --> 4359.98]  And he says first to the slaves,
[4360.28 --> 4364.30]  Serve wholeheartedly as if you were serving the Lord, not people.
[4364.72 --> 4369.18]  Because you know that the Lord will reward each one for whatever good they do,
[4369.38 --> 4370.98]  whether they are slave or free.
[4371.74 --> 4375.22]  And then masters, treat your slaves in the same way.
[4375.76 --> 4376.80]  Do not threaten them,
[4377.08 --> 4382.02]  since you know that he who is both their master and yours is in heaven
[4382.02 --> 4384.98]  and there is no favoritism with him.
[4384.98 --> 4388.78]  Whether you are a slave or a master in this life,
[4388.84 --> 4391.88]  you must live and serve the master of the next.
[4392.56 --> 4396.70]  He will return and he will judge and he will issue reward.
[4398.04 --> 4402.80]  Now as Christians, as Christians, please hear this.
[4403.72 --> 4407.40]  We don't have to fear that judgment.
[4409.16 --> 4412.98]  As Christians, we know that there is now no condemnation
[4412.98 --> 4416.18]  for those who are in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[4416.26 --> 4418.50]  That Jesus has lived the life I should have lived
[4418.50 --> 4420.98]  and that Jesus has died the death that I deserve
[4420.98 --> 4422.98]  as the punishment of God for my sin.
[4423.16 --> 4425.92]  That the wrath of God for all that I have done wrong
[4425.92 --> 4428.12]  is borne by him on the cross.
[4429.04 --> 4431.70]  And we know that the one who judges
[4431.70 --> 4433.70]  is also the one who justifies.
[4434.06 --> 4435.64]  And as the one who justifies,
[4435.74 --> 4437.44]  he has sent his spirit of grace
[4437.44 --> 4439.00]  into our hearts and minds
[4439.00 --> 4441.48]  that we might believe in him,
[4441.54 --> 4444.38]  that we might cling to him for our salvation.
[4445.42 --> 4448.30]  Right here today, that he gave up everything
[4448.30 --> 4451.76]  to give you the one thing that you did not deserve,
[4452.64 --> 4452.98]  himself.
[4454.46 --> 4456.72]  He gave us himself.
[4457.24 --> 4460.14]  God has truly given us everything
[4460.14 --> 4461.68]  in giving us himself.
[4461.68 --> 4466.28]  And since he has given us everything,
[4466.96 --> 4474.22]  is there anything he can't ask of you in return?
[4476.32 --> 4478.70]  Salvation has cost me nothing
[4478.70 --> 4481.76]  because it cost Jesus his life.
[4482.20 --> 4486.76]  And so even if following him costs me everything,
[4487.10 --> 4489.62]  even if it costs me my life,
[4489.62 --> 4493.72]  that is a price I have to be willing to pay.
[4497.72 --> 4502.46]  I believe that there is a sweetness,
[4503.96 --> 4506.02]  that there is a majesty
[4506.02 --> 4508.62]  and a compelling beauty
[4508.62 --> 4510.64]  to the words of the master
[4510.64 --> 4512.72]  when at the end he says,
[4512.98 --> 4517.22]  well done, good and faithful servant.
[4517.22 --> 4521.04]  Live for the well done,
[4521.54 --> 4524.36]  good and faithful servant.
[4527.36 --> 4528.32]  If you know me,
[4529.38 --> 4530.42]  you know that
[4530.42 --> 4536.40]  I don't really focus on age or my age.
[4537.30 --> 4539.70]  You know, turning 30 wasn't a big deal to me.
[4539.98 --> 4541.64]  Now 30 is almost 10 years behind me.
[4541.70 --> 4542.94]  Turning 40 next year,
[4543.18 --> 4544.38]  not a big deal to me.
[4544.38 --> 4546.28]  I know that there are some of you who are like,
[4546.36 --> 4547.44]  nope, I turned 40
[4547.44 --> 4548.98]  and that's where my counting stopped.
[4550.48 --> 4550.88]  Right?
[4551.04 --> 4553.32]  Where age matters to you
[4553.32 --> 4556.88]  and there's a sense of fear around it
[4556.88 --> 4559.54]  or if not fear,
[4559.66 --> 4561.14]  there's at least a sense of,
[4561.70 --> 4563.50]  do I really have to get older?
[4565.98 --> 4567.72]  No, that being the case,
[4568.10 --> 4568.28]  you know,
[4568.32 --> 4570.26]  there was never a birthday
[4570.26 --> 4570.88]  where I went,
[4570.96 --> 4571.92]  oh man, now I'm old.
[4571.92 --> 4574.18]  But there was a birthday
[4574.18 --> 4576.80]  that caused me to think
[4576.80 --> 4578.92]  about the cost of discipleship.
[4579.52 --> 4580.60]  I will never forget
[4580.60 --> 4582.34]  the day that I turned 33.
[4584.54 --> 4586.68]  My daughter Nora was in swimming lessons
[4586.68 --> 4588.70]  and I was watching her out in the pool
[4588.70 --> 4590.42]  and I was standing off to the side
[4590.42 --> 4591.14]  and it hit me.
[4592.28 --> 4592.68]  33,
[4592.68 --> 4597.50]  33 was the age at which Jesus died.
[4599.50 --> 4602.18]  His faithfulness to the Father
[4602.18 --> 4603.70]  cost him his life.
[4604.86 --> 4606.78]  What was Jesus going to ask of me
[4606.78 --> 4607.88]  in my 33rd year?
[4608.48 --> 4609.48]  That's what I wondered about.
[4610.66 --> 4612.38]  What was it going to cost me
[4612.38 --> 4614.66]  as a disciple of Jesus?
[4614.66 --> 4620.04]  And are we willing to bear that cost?
[4621.88 --> 4622.84]  Now I'm aware,
[4623.38 --> 4625.10]  particularly for myself now,
[4625.26 --> 4626.06]  as a pastor,
[4627.00 --> 4628.22]  that the cost
[4628.22 --> 4630.92]  of my discipleship
[4630.92 --> 4632.66]  affects more than me.
[4633.80 --> 4635.32]  The cost of my discipleship
[4635.32 --> 4636.52]  in some way affects you
[4636.52 --> 4639.18]  as people in our church together,
[4639.30 --> 4640.26]  but most importantly
[4640.26 --> 4641.96]  and most precisely
[4641.96 --> 4643.08]  and presciently right now,
[4643.08 --> 4644.50]  the cost of my discipleship
[4644.50 --> 4645.36]  affects my family,
[4646.32 --> 4647.66]  my wife and kids
[4647.66 --> 4649.68]  who have to follow me
[4649.68 --> 4650.76]  if I'm called somewhere,
[4652.88 --> 4655.36]  who have to bear the cost
[4655.36 --> 4656.62]  of my discipleship
[4656.62 --> 4659.06]  in a way that you guys don't.
[4662.60 --> 4663.52]  I'm aware
[4663.52 --> 4665.24]  that the cost
[4665.24 --> 4666.92]  of following Jesus,
[4667.16 --> 4667.82]  that the cost
[4667.82 --> 4669.80]  of following the Master,
[4670.02 --> 4672.00]  of living for the well-done,
[4672.16 --> 4673.06]  good and faithful servant,
[4673.08 --> 4674.60]  and affects more than just me,
[4674.70 --> 4675.58]  but it affects the people
[4675.58 --> 4676.76]  around me.
[4677.18 --> 4677.56]  But,
[4678.04 --> 4681.20]  I also believe,
[4682.18 --> 4683.34]  I also know
[4683.34 --> 4684.86]  in the depths of my heart,
[4685.14 --> 4686.38]  when I'm my best self
[4686.38 --> 4687.48]  in relationship to Jesus,
[4687.92 --> 4690.00]  that it is worth it.
[4691.16 --> 4692.58]  That it is worth it.
[4692.62 --> 4693.92]  That the kingdom of heaven
[4693.92 --> 4695.08]  and the glory of God
[4695.08 --> 4697.20]  far outweighs
[4697.20 --> 4699.28]  any lesser glory
[4699.28 --> 4700.56]  that this world has to offer.
[4700.56 --> 4702.60]  And so I go,
[4703.60 --> 4704.86]  and I invite you
[4704.86 --> 4705.86]  to come.
[4706.94 --> 4708.02]  I invite you
[4708.02 --> 4708.68]  to go
[4708.68 --> 4709.64]  and live
[4709.64 --> 4711.72]  for the well-done,
[4712.36 --> 4712.68]  good
[4712.68 --> 4713.94]  and faithful
[4713.94 --> 4715.08]  servant.
[4716.12 --> 4717.16]  The cost
[4717.16 --> 4718.10]  is
[4718.10 --> 4719.46]  worth it.
[4720.04 --> 4720.26]  Amen?
[4721.26 --> 4721.84]  Amen.
[4721.96 --> 4722.62]  Let's pray together.
[4722.62 --> 4730.26]  Lord Jesus,
[4730.76 --> 4731.60]  as we
[4731.60 --> 4734.08]  imagine now
[4734.08 --> 4735.08]  the cost
[4735.08 --> 4736.82]  of our discipleship,
[4736.88 --> 4737.64]  as we imagine
[4737.64 --> 4738.34]  now
[4738.34 --> 4740.48]  the responsibility
[4740.48 --> 4741.70]  of following
[4741.70 --> 4742.66]  after you,
[4742.84 --> 4744.04]  may we do so,
[4744.24 --> 4744.44]  God,
[4744.52 --> 4745.64]  not alone,
[4746.64 --> 4748.18]  not apart,
[4748.66 --> 4749.82]  and by ourselves,
[4750.06 --> 4751.12]  but as a part
[4751.12 --> 4752.10]  of this community,
[4753.06 --> 4753.90]  as a part
[4753.90 --> 4754.96]  of this church,
[4755.10 --> 4756.18]  this family,
[4756.32 --> 4756.76]  this group
[4756.76 --> 4757.90]  of brothers and sisters
[4757.90 --> 4758.80]  who have been called
[4758.80 --> 4759.56]  by you
[4759.56 --> 4760.84]  to bear the cost
[4760.84 --> 4761.94]  of our discipleship
[4761.94 --> 4762.68]  together.
[4763.88 --> 4765.16]  May we go
[4765.16 --> 4766.34]  in the power
[4766.34 --> 4767.96]  of your coming.
[4769.08 --> 4769.92]  May we go
[4769.92 --> 4771.26]  bearing the cost
[4771.26 --> 4771.98]  of discipleship
[4771.98 --> 4772.86]  because you
[4772.86 --> 4774.22]  bore the cross,
[4774.38 --> 4775.64]  and it was for the joy
[4775.64 --> 4776.82]  set before you
[4776.82 --> 4777.80]  that you endured
[4777.80 --> 4778.36]  the cross
[4778.36 --> 4779.44]  and scorned its shame,
[4779.44 --> 4780.36]  and so may it be
[4780.36 --> 4781.38]  for the joy
[4781.38 --> 4782.76]  set before us,
[4782.90 --> 4783.40]  the kingdom
[4783.40 --> 4784.40]  of heaven,
[4784.72 --> 4785.64]  and seeing you
[4785.64 --> 4787.06]  face to face,
[4787.46 --> 4788.30]  may it be that we
[4788.30 --> 4789.42]  go now
[4789.42 --> 4792.52]  willing to bear
[4792.52 --> 4793.10]  the cost,
[4793.24 --> 4794.42]  whatever it
[4794.42 --> 4795.60]  may be.
[4796.26 --> 4797.18]  Make us willing
[4797.18 --> 4797.80]  and able,
[4797.92 --> 4798.30]  I pray,
[4798.44 --> 4799.10]  in the name
[4799.10 --> 4799.98]  of Jesus,
[4800.40 --> 4801.48]  our Christ.
[4801.70 --> 4802.08]  Take
[4802.08 --> 4803.72]  my life
[4803.72 --> 4805.82]  and let it be.
[4807.28 --> 4807.80]  Amen.
[4809.44 --> 4839.42]  Amen.
[4839.44 --> 4849.00]  Take my life and let it be
[4849.00 --> 4854.64]  Consecrate the Lord to Thee
[4854.64 --> 4860.30]  Take my moments and my days
[4860.30 --> 4866.02]  Let them flow in endless praise
[4866.02 --> 4872.50]  Let them flow in endless praise
[4872.50 --> 4878.80]  Take my silver and my gold
[4878.80 --> 4883.80]  What am I, good I withhold
[4883.80 --> 4890.38]  Take my intellect and use
[4890.38 --> 4896.14]  Every power as thou shalt choose
[4896.14 --> 4902.70]  Every power as thou shalt choose
[4902.70 --> 4909.66]  Take my will and make it thine
[4909.66 --> 4915.82]  It shall be no longer mine
[4915.82 --> 4922.36]  Take my heart, it is thine own
[4922.36 --> 4928.38]  It shall be thy royal throne
[4928.38 --> 4934.86]  It shall be thy royal throne
[4934.86 --> 4943.30]  Take my love, my Lord, I hold
[4943.30 --> 4948.86]  And guide me with treasure's hope
[4948.86 --> 4956.22]  Take my self and thy will be
[4956.22 --> 4962.34]  Ever only all for thee
[4962.34 --> 4969.34]  Ever only all for thee
[4969.34 --> 4979.66]  As you go into this week
[4979.66 --> 4982.82]  counting the cost of being the disciple of Jesus
[4982.82 --> 4985.92]  know that God himself goes with you
[4985.92 --> 4987.74]  and so receive the blessing
[4987.74 --> 4989.66]  and the power of his name
[4989.66 --> 4991.72]  over you as you go
[4991.72 --> 4994.66]  May God go before you
[4994.66 --> 4995.72]  to guide you
[4995.72 --> 4997.76]  May God go behind you
[4997.76 --> 4998.92]  to protect you
[4998.92 --> 5000.96]  May God go beneath you
[5000.96 --> 5001.88]  to support you
[5001.88 --> 5003.62]  and may God go beside you
[5003.62 --> 5004.74]  to befriend you
[5004.74 --> 5006.56]  Do not be afraid
[5006.56 --> 5008.42]  Let the blessing of God
[5008.42 --> 5009.28]  come upon you today
[5009.28 --> 5011.04]  Do not be afraid
[5011.04 --> 5013.60]  But go in peace
[5013.60 --> 5016.68]  to love and serve the Lord
[5016.68 --> 5018.50]  Amen
[5025.72 --> 5029.68]  Now unto the King eternal
[5029.68 --> 5050.66]  Now unto the King eternal
[5050.66 --> 5055.66]  Unto the King immortal
[5055.66 --> 5060.66]  Unto the King immortal

[5070.66 --> 5075.66]  The only wise God
