[423.64 → 432.84] I love you, Lord
[432.84 → 438.40] Oh, your mercy never fails me
[438.40 → 444.88] All my days I've been held in your hands
[444.88 → 449.76] From the moment that I wake up
[449.76 → 453.08] Until I lay my head
[453.08 → 459.22] I will sing of the goodness of God
[459.22 → 466.56] All my life you have been faithful
[466.56 → 475.42] And all my life you have been so, so good
[475.42 → 480.48] With every breath that I am in
[480.48 → 487.14] I will sing of the goodness of God
[487.14 → 491.04] I love your voice
[491.04 → 496.20] You have led me through the fire
[496.20 → 499.54] In the darkest night
[500.24 → 503.24] You are close, Lord, no other
[503.24 → 507.28] I've known you as a father
[507.28 → 511.04] I've known you as a friend
[511.04 → 517.86] And I have lived in the goodness of God
[517.86 → 523.02] And all my life you have been faithful
[523.02 → 524.62] And all my life you have been faithful
[524.62 → 533.94] And all my life you have been so, so good
[533.94 → 538.92] With every breath that I am able
[538.92 → 545.14] Oh, I receive of the goodness of God
[545.14 → 562.48] Good morning. Welcome to church.
[562.60 → 564.38] I want to start just by saying
[564.38 → 566.40] Happy Mother's Day to those of you
[566.40 → 568.30] whom are mothers. Hi, Mom.
[568.50 → 570.24] Happy Mother's Day. I love you.
[571.24 → 573.02] Also, we want to acknowledge that this day
[573.02 → 574.16] can be hard for some of you
[574.16 → 577.12] For those of you who have lost mothers recently
[577.12 → 579.80] or who are longing to be a mom
[579.80 → 582.32] and aren't able to for whatever reason
[582.32 → 584.64] For those who have strained relationships
[584.64 → 586.40] with your moms
[586.40 → 588.56] We know that this day can be particularly hard
[588.56 → 591.98] And so even as we remember and celebrate moms
[591.98 → 593.82] we want to acknowledge that
[593.82 → 596.78] we don't all experience this day in the same way
[596.78 → 599.58] And so it's our hope that in worship today
[599.58 → 601.94] we actually come to experience Jesus
[601.94 → 604.50] and the truth of the gospel
[604.50 → 606.30] and the identity that we are given
[606.30 → 607.52] and granted in him
[607.52 → 610.92] so that no matter what our other circumstances may be
[610.92 → 612.62] we go in confidence
[612.62 → 615.64] as sons and daughters of the King
[615.64 → 617.84] That's when you say Amen
[617.84 → 620.60] Okay, we'll work on that
[620.60 → 623.96] Just a quick reminder
[623.96 → 625.46] there is pastor's class
[625.46 → 627.58] following our worship today
[627.58 → 630.02] And so we will have a quick
[630.02 → 631.10] grab a quick coffee
[631.10 → 632.02] have a quick conversation
[632.02 → 632.88] and then we'll head over
[632.88 → 635.18] and continue in our pastor's class
[635.18 → 639.42] And there is HCBC tonight
[639.42 → 639.98] Thank you
[639.98 → 641.26] For the youth
[641.26 → 642.32] If you don't know what that is
[642.32 → 643.54] you can talk to Pastor Kevin
[643.54 → 644.18] He's right there
[644.18 → 647.20] And I don't think I yet said
[647.20 → 647.90] but my name is Chris
[647.90 → 649.96] And I'm one of the pastors here
[649.96 → 651.82] And I want to welcome you to worship
[651.82 → 654.26] And then also I want to say
[654.26 → 655.42] a special thank you
[655.42 → 657.48] to all of those who came
[657.48 → 658.64] on Friday and Saturday
[658.64 → 659.72] to the worship conference
[659.72 → 660.60] that we had here
[660.60 → 661.34] and to the volunteers
[661.34 → 663.20] who made that possible
[663.20 → 664.68] It was a huge success
[664.68 → 665.74] and a blessing for us
[665.74 → 666.40] to be together
[666.40 → 668.22] And, so thank you for that
[668.22 → 670.28] And we hope to do some of that again
[670.28 → 672.04] Make your way slowly
[672.04 → 672.46] I know
[672.46 → 675.44] And then Leslie
[675.44 → 676.90] is going to have an announcement too
[676.90 → 692.06] So I just want to reiterate
[692.06 → 694.10] that the worship conference
[694.10 → 694.68] this weekend
[694.68 → 696.22] was absolutely wonderful
[696.22 → 697.82] It was so good to be here
[697.82 → 699.88] But I got to tell you
[699.88 → 701.38] I am so sore
[701.38 → 702.80] from sitting on those chairs
[702.80 → 704.28] all weekend
[704.28 → 706.46] Like really sore
[706.46 → 708.50] So just a reminder
[708.50 → 709.84] Chairs and squares
[709.84 → 711.20] We've got the squares
[711.20 → 712.64] We still need the chairs
[712.64 → 715.94] We need about $20,000 yet
[715.94 → 717.52] to before we order them
[717.52 → 719.34] This is your friendly reminder
[719.34 → 722.44] Oh look she's healed
[722.44 → 728.58] I'm going to invite you
[728.58 → 729.46] as you are able
[729.46 → 730.64] and where you are to stand
[730.64 → 732.22] and we can be welcomed
[732.22 → 734.16] into God's presence together
[734.16 → 742.64] People of God
[742.64 → 745.28] He gathers us to Himself
[745.28 → 746.16] in worship
[746.16 → 747.42] and so receive

[753.80 → 754.88] and the Lord Jesus Christ
[754.88 → 755.48] His Son
[755.48 → 756.56] and our Saviour
[756.56 → 757.68] through the presence
[757.68 → 758.34] and power
[758.34 → 759.64] of the Holy Spirit
[759.64 → 760.92] Amen
[760.92 → 779.66] Sing joyfully to the Lord
[779.66 → 780.30] you righteous
[780.30 → 782.66] It is fitting for the upright
[782.66 → 783.52] to praise Him
[783.52 → 785.96] Praise the Lord with harp
[785.96 → 787.46] Make music to Him
[787.46 → 789.16] on the ten-stringed lyre
[789.16 → 790.78] Sing to Him
[790.78 → 791.58] a new song
[791.58 → 792.52] Play skilfully
[792.52 → 794.70] and shout for joy
[794.70 → 798.54] A moves' hair
[798.54 → 798.70] in only one
[798.70 → 800.06] Give it
[800.06 → 800.78] And let's rest

[807.54 → 807.96] of our generation
[807.96 → 808.28] too genius
[808.28 → 809.38] and the day
[809.38 → 809.46] to guard
[809.46 → 809.48] to bear
[809.48 → 810.48] to get
[810.48 → 810.62] a new mindset
[810.62 → 810.70] and the death
[810.70 → 811.28] Andon
[811.28 → 811.46] the brain

[1032.14 → 1037.40] Let mercy follow me
[1037.40 → 1040.32] Everyone needs forgiveness
[1040.32 → 1043.56] The kindness of the Saviour
[1043.56 → 1048.36] The hope of nation
[1048.36 → 1055.20] Oh Saviour
[1055.20 → 1058.32] He can take a mountain
[1058.78 → 1061.82] My God is mighty to save
[1061.82 → 1064.32] He is mighty to save
[1064.84 → 1066.48] Forever
[1066.48 → 1069.12] The hope of salvation

[1072.94 → 1076.02] Jesus conquered the grave
[1076.02 → 1091.14] So take me as you guide me
[1091.14 → 1093.44] All my fears and plans
[1093.44 → 1095.98] I will not be able to save
[1095.98 → 1097.90] I will not be able to save
[1097.90 → 1098.90] I will not be able to save
[1098.90 → 1099.90] I will not be able to save

[1121.80 → 1124.74] He is mighty to save
[1124.74 → 1126.24] Forever
[1126.24 → 1129.56] He is averaged
[1129.56 → 1131.70] 鬼 from the Leach
[1131.70 → 1131.72] And killed
[1131.72 → 1145.30] Next

[1151.70 → 1157.46] Receive for the glory of the risen King.
[1158.84 → 1162.18] He came through the mountains.
[1162.72 → 1165.46] My God is mighty to save.
[1165.76 → 1168.46] He is mighty to save.
[1168.88 → 1172.72] Forever, author of salvation.
[1172.72 → 1176.36] He rose and conquered the grave.
[1176.56 → 1179.82] Jesus conquered the grave.
[1180.20 → 1184.04] Saviour, he came through the mountains.
[1184.70 → 1187.46] My God is mighty to save.
[1187.80 → 1190.48] He is mighty to save.
[1190.90 → 1194.68] Forever, author of salvation.
[1195.68 → 1198.46] He rose and conquered the grave.
[1198.46 → 1201.46] Jesus conquered the grave.
[1202.72 → 1210.12] Search me, God, and know my heart.
[1211.02 → 1213.78] Test me and know my anxious thoughts.
[1214.52 → 1216.86] See if there is any offensive way in me.
[1217.56 → 1219.60] And lead me in the way everlasting.
[1221.04 → 1221.90] Should we bow our heads?
[1221.90 → 1231.70] Father, we come to you knowing how easily our hearts can grow anxious.
[1232.40 → 1235.78] How easily we can be distracted in the cultures that we live in.
[1237.02 → 1240.92] We have allowed offensive ways to settle in our hearts.
[1241.92 → 1243.84] We ask for your forgiveness, Lord.
[1243.84 → 1250.58] Although we trip and fall in our walk with you, our hearts' desire is to please you.
[1251.46 → 1252.44] To trust you.
[1253.16 → 1255.84] To lay all we have before your feet.
[1257.74 → 1261.38] Forgive us when our actions reveal the motivations of our hearts.
[1262.44 → 1264.54] Lord, will you purify our hearts.
[1265.54 → 1267.30] Lead us in your way everlasting.
[1268.36 → 1270.38] Lord, how we need you.
[1270.38 → 1271.78] Amen.
[1273.08 → 1274.56] Shall we rise to sing a song?
[1274.56 → 1304.54] Thank you.
[1304.56 → 1328.56] I confess, bowing here, I find my rest. Without you, I fall apart. You're the one that guides my heart.
[1328.56 → 1343.56] Lord, I need you. Oh, I need you. Every hour I need you.
[1343.56 → 1355.56] I want defence, my righteousness. Oh God, how I need you.
[1355.56 → 1357.56] I want defence, my righteousness. Oh God, how I need you.
[1357.56 → 1371.56] Sin runs deep. Your grace is more. Where grace is found, is where you are.
[1371.56 → 1383.56] Where you are, Lord, I am free. Holiness is Christ in me.
[1383.56 → 1396.56] Where you are, Lord, I am free. Holiness is Christ in me.
[1396.56 → 1411.56] Lord, I need you. Oh, I need you. Every hour I need you.
[1411.56 → 1422.56] My one defence, my righteousness. Oh God, how I need you.
[1422.56 → 1433.56] So teach my song to rise to you. When temptation comes my way.
[1433.56 → 1443.56] When I cannot stand upon you. Jesus, you're my hope and sin.

[1613.34 → 1617.40] and skilfully wrought in the depths of the earth.
[1618.16 → 1620.92] Your eyes have seen my unformed substance,

[1785.36 → 1787.36] Holy, holy, holy.
[1787.36 → 1789.36] I want to see you.
[1789.36 → 1806.44] Holy, holy, holy.
[1806.50 → 1810.02] Holy, holy, holy.
[1810.02 → 1813.50] I want to see you.
[1819.36 → 1832.08] Morning. Can I have all the kids age 5 to grade 4 come on up? You guys are already here.
[1838.08 → 1843.66] Oh man. There are lots of you guys today. Come on in.
[1843.66 → 1855.18] Okay. Nice to see you guys. So today's a special day. It's Mother's Day. Your mom is super.
[1857.18 → 1867.22] Yeah? Oh boy. We won't repeat some of the ages coming around. Yeah. Special day, right? So it's a day we celebrate our moms.
[1867.22 → 1873.88] We celebrate people who are like moms to us, like stepmoms and grandmas and other special caretakers.
[1874.30 → 1878.94] And some of us, we remember our moms, right? Some of us, our moms have already passed on.
[1879.64 → 1882.92] It's a very special day. Do you guys have special plans? Yeah?
[1888.36 → 1892.98] Oh, heart cookies. Well, Santa's a little early. What are you doing?
[1892.98 → 1905.32] Oh. Oh, perfect. Mom gets to do a few special things today too, right? She gets to call the shots.
[1905.80 → 1911.20] Any other special events? What are some of the favourite things your mom does for you?
[1912.42 → 1917.18] What are some special things your mom does to you? There's probably so many, you can't even list them all.
[1917.18 → 1917.84] What do you think, I?
[1922.98 → 1927.96] Oh, makes breakfast. What do you want to?
[1931.20 → 1935.60] Oh, chocolate cereal, special cereal. What else? What did you want to say?
[1937.44 → 1939.80] Oh, baking cookies. Food's a highlight here.
[1940.80 → 1942.36] What do you think, Malachi or Zoe?
[1943.98 → 1945.38] Supper. Yep, yep, yep.
[1948.72 → 1951.44] Protecting the family. Yep, that's a big one.
[1951.44 → 1953.44] There are so many special things our moms do for us.
[1953.76 → 1956.52] And usually they're like, we think of highlight things, right?
[1956.58 → 1962.78] Like the special things like making special cakes and big hugs and crafts.
[1963.80 → 1968.08] Sometimes it's not always the most positive things for us though, right?
[1968.12 → 1969.42] But ultimately it is positive.
[1969.84 → 1973.58] Sometimes moms have to do the hard stuff too, right?
[1973.58 → 1975.40] Like some of those extra chores.
[1975.94 → 1981.24] And sometimes they have to call us to be good kids too, right?
[1981.60 → 1985.16] Sometimes we have hard lessons we have to learn and moms get to come in to do that.
[1985.54 → 1991.44] So today we're going to learn about a guy in the Bible who learned a really hard lesson.
[1991.90 → 1996.58] Sometimes hard lessons don't always make us feel great, but sometimes they're the right thing to do, right?
[1996.58 → 2005.04] So we're going to learn about a good lesson today, and we're going to talk about more about some of the awesome things our moms do for us in Sunday school today.
[2005.30 → 2008.68] Let's stand, and we'll do the children's blessing, and then we'll get off to our story.
[2008.68 → 2008.74] Thank you.
[2008.74 → 2008.80] Thank you.
[2026.58 → 2055.64] Good morning.
[2055.64 → 2056.84] My name is Glenn Not.
[2056.92 → 2058.42] I'm one of the elders here at Emmanuel.
[2059.44 → 2064.36] And I have one announcement before we go to our Lord in congregational prayer.
[2064.90 → 2067.94] We are still looking for one pastoral elder.
[2068.74 → 2077.74] So I would urge all of you this week to consider whom you can nominate for that position and please do so during this week.
[2079.86 → 2081.24] So let's go to God in prayer.
[2085.64 → 2089.44] Holy Father, it is our joy and privilege to come to you in prayer this morning.
[2090.44 → 2094.32] During the past week, we were blessed to experience your glory and beauty,
[2094.32 → 2098.78] reflected and displayed in creation as the last of the trees put out.
[2098.78 → 2099.28] Thank you.
