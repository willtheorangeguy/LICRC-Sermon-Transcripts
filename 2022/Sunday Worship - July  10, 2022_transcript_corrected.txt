[2789.86 → 2790.86] Thank you.
[2819.86 → 2849.84] And so,
[2849.86 → 2850.86] Thank you.
[2850.86 → 2873.34] Good morning.
[2873.68 → 2874.64] My name is Glenn.
[2874.74 → 2879.88] I'm one of the elders here at Emanuel Church, and it's now my privilege to lead you in our
[2879.88 → 2880.90] congregational prayer.
[2885.72 → 2890.44] Father in heaven, we thank you for the opportunity to come to you in prayer this morning.
[2891.20 → 2897.38] You are almighty God, creator of heaven and earth, and we acknowledge your dominion over
[2897.38 → 2898.26] all creation.
[2899.08 → 2900.20] You are holy.
[2901.10 → 2904.34] Help us to revere your name in all that we say and do.
[2904.34 → 2912.96] We thank you for Christ Jesus, whose life, death, and resurrection made us alive in him
[2912.96 → 2917.70] even when we were dead in our sin and restored our relationship with you.
[2919.22 → 2921.86] Your grace and mercy are utterly amazing.
[2922.64 → 2927.70] We are not worthy of your love, and yet you call us your children and heirs.
[2928.68 → 2931.10] Praise, glory, and honour to you, Lord.
[2931.10 → 2935.12] Father, we thank you for this local church community.
[2936.12 → 2937.74] Help us to be united in purpose.
[2938.94 → 2943.24] We thank you for the gifts that you give your people and their willingness to use their gifts
[2943.24 → 2946.66] to proclaim the gospel in so many different ways.
[2948.26 → 2952.50] Thank you for providing new elders and deacons to serve in this community.
[2954.06 → 2959.40] Grant them the presence of your Holy Spirit so that they will lead with wisdom and discernment.
[2959.40 → 2965.54] Grant them love and compassion for those whom they serve in a pastoral role.
[2967.48 → 2971.08] Father, we ask for your blessing on Kids Camp, which will begin this week.
[2971.92 → 2974.42] Bless the leaders as they proclaim the gospel story.
[2975.28 → 2977.08] And be near to all the children who participate.
[2978.18 → 2981.08] Give that these children will deepen their relationship with you.
[2981.08 → 2990.46] If there are children who hear about you for the first time, we ask that you draw them into a relationship with you through the work of your Holy Spirit.
[2992.10 → 2996.72] This morning we ask that you be with Ellen White, who fractured her wrist.
[2997.78 → 3003.86] Grant the medical professionals wisdom to prescribe treatment, which will give Ellen complete healing.
[3003.86 → 3011.70] We thank you that Harry Barman underwent successful surgery on his arms.
[3012.70 → 3016.42] And we ask that you bless the further treatments that he will receive.
[3017.06 → 3022.90] Lord, it's our prayer that his mobility will be completely restored through these treatments.
[3022.90 → 3029.64] Bless those who struggle with strained relationships.
[3031.26 → 3035.52] Grant those who have done wrong the humility to ask for forgiveness.
[3036.84 → 3042.14] And grant those who have been wronged the grace to forgive and to find a way forward.
[3043.74 → 3049.52] Be with those who grieve after losing loved ones, whether recently or some time ago.
[3049.52 → 3055.98] Surround them with your presence when loneliness and a sense of loss sets in.
[3056.90 → 3065.66] And help us as immediate family members and as church family members to comfort and care for those who grieve and experience loneliness.
[3068.46 → 3074.92] This week we witness tragedy as the result of mass shootings in Chicago and in Victoria.
[3075.92 → 3077.78] Comfort those who have lost loved ones.
[3077.78 → 3080.72] Grant healing to those who have been injured.
[3082.20 → 3087.76] We thank you for law enforcement personnel who put their lives on the line to keep the public safe.
[3088.84 → 3093.06] And we pray that you watch over these people as they serve our communities.
[3097.40 → 3100.34] We continue to lift the people of Ukraine to you.
[3101.28 → 3104.52] Strengthen those who remain in the country to resist the invasion.
[3104.52 → 3108.70] Watch over the millions of Ukrainians who have been displaced.
[3108.94 → 3115.06] Equip the people and agencies who have taken in displaced people with all that they need.
[3115.88 → 3120.96] Thank you for the hospitality which has been extended to these displaced people.
[3120.96 → 3124.88] Comfort all who have lost loved ones this war.
[3125.98 → 3134.86] We also ask that you grant wisdom to the leaders of Western Europe, NATO, as they consider how to respond to this aggression.
[3135.38 → 3136.00] Give them wisdom.
[3136.00 → 3137.36] We ask that you grant wisdom.
[3137.36 → 3142.52] And we continue to ask for a withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine.
[3144.06 → 3147.04] And we ask for peace to return to this region.
[3147.04 → 3149.04] We pray that you grant wisdom.
[3151.04 → 3154.24] We pray that you watch over those in our church family who are on vacation.
[3155.12 → 3159.10] We thank you for our work and for the opportunities that we have in this country.
[3159.74 → 3162.50] We are also grateful for the opportunity to rest.
[3163.34 → 3170.96] We ask that our times of rest will re-energize us and that they will also be times when we grow closer to you.
[3170.96 → 3181.80] And now, Lord, as we turn to your word, we ask that you bless Pastor Chris with the presence of your spirit and speak your truth through him.
[3183.00 → 3189.70] Give us ears which are eager to hear your truth and equip us to do your will as we begin this new week.
[3190.38 → 3192.04] In Jesus' name, amen.
[3200.96 → 3225.40] Today we are starting our summer preaching series as we will be looking at a bunch of parables of Jesus.
[3225.40 → 3233.78] And so we are going to start that this morning with the parables of the mustard seed and of the yeast.
[3234.00 → 3239.08] If you have a Bible in front of you, always I encourage you to open that up, have that with you, read along.
[3239.16 → 3245.14] We are going to read Matthew 13, beginning at verse 31.
[3251.64 → 3252.76] From Matthew 13.
[3255.40 → 3258.58] Jesus told them another parable.
[3258.58 → 3267.02] The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field.
[3268.44 → 3276.12] Though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree,
[3277.00 → 3279.94] so that birds come and perch in its branches.
[3281.36 → 3283.36] He told them still another parable.
[3283.36 → 3292.50] The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about 60 pounds of flour until it worked all through the dough.
[3294.70 → 3298.10] Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables.
[3298.60 → 3301.24] He did not say anything to them without using a parable.
[3301.68 → 3304.80] So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet.
[3304.80 → 3311.88] I will open my mouth in parables and I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world.
[3312.98 → 3314.28] This is the word of the Lord.
[3320.10 → 3327.54] Now one of my favourite words in the probably the whole of the English language,
[3327.68 → 3331.20] one of my favourite words is obfuscation.
[3331.20 → 3337.86] Because whenever I use it, I get that exact face.
[3338.12 → 3338.58] Thank you.
[3340.30 → 3340.52] Right?
[3340.60 → 3344.74] People look at me and with their face or with their words or with their laughter,
[3344.88 → 3345.16] they go,
[3345.54 → 3347.16] What on earth does that mean?
[3348.02 → 3351.14] That seems so unnecessarily confusing.
[3351.14 → 3357.44] Now if you know the word obfuscation, it means unnecessarily confusing.
[3358.54 → 3363.82] That's why I love the word, because the facial expression I get in response is the meaning of the word.
[3363.92 → 3368.24] It means to make things less clear or to intentionally confuse.
[3369.28 → 3377.12] I want to start in this confusion because we are jumping into a series on the parables of Jesus.
[3377.12 → 3388.34] And throughout all the gospels, you will get about eight or nine different categories of parables.
[3389.20 → 3396.28] Now I say that because I'm borrowing a breakdown or a categorization from a scholar named Klein Snodgrass,
[3396.40 → 3399.70] who wrote a book on the parables of Jesus called Stories with Intent.
[3400.10 → 3404.54] It is a pretty dense book, but it is a good one if you wanted a commentary on the parables.
[3404.54 → 3412.26] Anyway, point is, each week what we are going to do is look at one of those different categories or types of parables
[3412.26 → 3422.76] so we get the span or the scope of Jesus' messages given in parable on lostness or eschatology or money or prayer or Israel or kingdom,
[3423.16 → 3424.06] whatever the case may be.
[3425.14 → 3430.84] Now our first parable, as we read, is this parable of the mustard seed and of the yeast.
[3430.84 → 3437.62] But before we dig too deep into that, I think it's important for us to start with the question,
[3438.28 → 3440.56] why did Jesus teach in parables?
[3441.20 → 3445.90] Matthew writes, he spoke all these things to the crowds in parables.
[3446.12 → 3449.14] He did not say anything to them without using a parable.
[3450.08 → 3453.08] And so, it's worth the question, why?
[3453.08 → 3453.16] Why?
[3454.56 → 3460.30] I want to suggest that the answer might not be as simple as you first thought.
[3461.68 → 3469.12] Now I know that some of you here this morning are what's called propositional thinkers.
[3470.12 → 3470.60] Right?
[3470.72 → 3473.62] That is, you think in a very particular way.
[3473.80 → 3478.08] And I know that some of you here this morning are what's called narrative thinkers.
[3478.64 → 3479.52] So you think differently.
[3479.52 → 3487.58] What I mean by that is some of you like logic and order, a syllogistic structure, a thesis statement,
[3487.86 → 3492.80] and then three or seven or 37 arguments to support that thesis.
[3493.82 → 3496.36] Others of you just want to hear a story.
[3497.54 → 3497.72] Right?
[3497.76 → 3501.38] You don't think in propositions or arguments in rebuttals or rejoinders.
[3501.46 → 3503.60] You think in stories or images.
[3503.60 → 3514.68] Whenever I have a discussion with my daughter, yes, you, who's nine going on 25, especially
[3514.68 → 3515.82] if she wants something.
[3516.48 → 3516.72] Right?
[3516.76 → 3518.70] I can see it in her face.
[3519.76 → 3519.94] Right?
[3520.20 → 3525.28] You can, I can see it even as she closes her eyes and her eyes are moving around.
[3525.28 → 3532.54] She is working out her arguments, thinking about the best way to make her argument and
[3532.54 → 3538.74] to structure it, discerning how to articulate the illusion of compromise and choice, but
[3538.74 → 3539.84] so that she still gets her way.
[3540.96 → 3542.42] Do any of you else have kids like this?
[3544.12 → 3544.36] Right?
[3544.44 → 3547.58] She argues logically, and it follows a very ordered set.
[3548.46 → 3551.24] Now she comes by that honestly because my brain works the same way.
[3551.28 → 3552.28] So it's only my fault.
[3552.38 → 3553.96] I take full responsibility for that.
[3553.96 → 3559.02] But Malachi, my son, on the other hand, right, he jumps all over the place.
[3559.10 → 3560.84] Sometimes literally, if you know Malachi.
[3562.18 → 3562.58] Right?
[3562.64 → 3566.14] And we have to ask him to stand still so that we can focus on what he's saying.
[3566.72 → 3572.46] And he will tell elaborate stories about the adventures that he's been on and how he needs
[3572.46 → 3575.02] this or that thing in order to continue them.
[3575.06 → 3577.48] It's usually a Nerf gun or a water gun of some sort.
[3578.60 → 3578.82] Right?
[3578.82 → 3583.40] And for Malachi, sometimes we just don't know the difference between his stories and real life.
[3583.96 → 3589.72] And I think that's in part because of, that's just the frame through which he sees the world.
[3589.72 → 3596.90] Now, one or the other is neither good nor bad, neither better nor worse.
[3597.20 → 3601.02] They're just the ways that people engage and interact and think.
[3602.46 → 3609.78] Parables are stories to make a theological point out of the world around us.
[3609.78 → 3611.90] Let me say that again.
[3612.76 → 3618.72] Parables are stories to make a theological point out of the world around us.
[3620.32 → 3624.56] But, here's where we get to the part where it's not what you thought it was.
[3624.98 → 3629.10] Parables are also an intentional obfuscation.
[3630.38 → 3631.82] See how we came back to that word?
[3633.44 → 3634.72] Let me show you where I get that.
[3634.72 → 3641.86] If your Bibles are still open, let's look at an earlier part in this same chapter from Matthew 13.
[3642.66 → 3644.84] In verse 10, we read,
[3644.84 → 3671.68] And then he quotes,
[3671.68 → 3683.98] In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah.
[3684.74 → 3686.96] You will be ever hearing but never understanding.
[3687.14 → 3688.94] You will be ever seeing but never perceiving.
[3689.52 → 3691.66] For the people's heart has become calloused.
[3692.00 → 3694.64] They hardly hear with their ears and their eyes.
[3695.12 → 3696.64] And they have closed their eyes.
[3696.92 → 3700.64] Otherwise, they might see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their hearts.
[3700.64 → 3704.54] As it is, and I would turn, and I would heal them.
[3705.60 → 3711.80] But blessed are your eyes because they see and your ears because they hear.
[3713.68 → 3715.38] Intentional obfuscation.
[3715.88 → 3715.96] Right?
[3716.38 → 3718.36] Those seeing, they do not see.
[3718.82 → 3720.82] Hearing, they do not hear.
[3720.82 → 3725.18] And so even though parables are stories to make a theological point,
[3725.56 → 3730.40] They're also intended to confuse people who don't get it.
[3731.66 → 3738.34] What Jesus is saying here is that if the story isn't for you, it won't make sense to you.
[3739.78 → 3741.80] Jesus said in verse 11,
[3741.80 → 3747.50] Because the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them.
[3748.28 → 3754.24] And so let me be really clear because this is so common in our trying to understand the parables.
[3754.66 → 3754.74] Right?
[3754.92 → 3761.58] Parables aren't just moralisms for the world to be full of, quote, good people.
[3762.32 → 3762.82] Right?
[3762.82 → 3766.88] Even if that's what our post-Christian culture reduces them to.
[3767.98 → 3768.24] Right?
[3768.34 → 3773.72] Like, so, for example, the lesson of the parable of the Good Samaritan,
[3773.86 → 3776.80] Which is, like, probably one of the most famous parables there is.
[3776.84 → 3776.94] Right?
[3776.96 → 3781.48] There are Good Samaritan laws that exist or used to exist in some countries.
[3781.82 → 3782.08] Right?
[3782.08 → 3787.40] The lesson of the Good Samaritan parable isn't help people in need.
[3789.56 → 3791.26] Because that's just the moralism.
[3792.52 → 3797.50] The lesson is that the new creation, kingdom of God, reality,
[3797.98 → 3805.28] Makes followers of Jesus from people who would be natural enemies and turns them into neighbours.
[3806.56 → 3806.68] Right?
[3806.68 → 3812.34] Redemption is a diverse body full of every tribe, nation, and tongue,
[3812.50 → 3817.46] With Jesus as king on the throne of grace and on the throne of your heart.
[3818.12 → 3818.72] Right?
[3818.74 → 3822.46] It's about who you are, not just what you do.
[3826.74 → 3828.90] And for those outside,
[3830.58 → 3834.74] Gospel living is going to be confusing.
[3834.74 → 3835.92] Right?
[3835.94 → 3837.46] It's not going to make sense.
[3838.18 → 3838.28] Right?
[3840.28 → 3841.90] If you want to gain heaven,
[3843.14 → 3843.98] Give up everything.
[3846.10 → 3846.46] Right?
[3846.46 → 3847.78] If you want to be first,
[3848.70 → 3849.48] Come last.
[3850.34 → 3851.78] If you want to be strong,
[3852.66 → 3853.20] Be weak.
[3854.02 → 3854.14] Right?
[3854.16 → 3855.64] These are what Jesus says.
[3856.24 → 3856.34] Right?
[3856.38 → 3859.92] The poor in spirit receive the kingdom of heaven.
[3861.00 → 3861.84] The meek.
[3863.32 → 3864.24] The meek.
[3864.74 → 3866.66] Inherit the earth.
[3869.76 → 3873.20] The meek don't inherit anything in our society and culture.
[3873.56 → 3874.74] But not according to Jesus.
[3874.86 → 3874.96] Right?
[3875.08 → 3878.00] That doesn't make sense to the world around us.
[3878.02 → 3879.10] That doesn't add up.
[3880.40 → 3881.08] Unless,
[3881.60 → 3885.10] Unless you know Jesus.
[3886.14 → 3886.64] Right?
[3886.68 → 3889.40] The kingdom of heaven has its own economy.
[3889.40 → 3896.12] And that economy looks like foolishness and is a stumbling block to those who are outside.
[3897.86 → 3898.52] And maybe,
[3898.86 → 3900.98] Where you are at right now,
[3901.08 → 3903.46] Maybe all you see is that foolishness.
[3903.78 → 3905.42] You look at this Christian thing, and you go,
[3905.54 → 3908.50] Yeah, that's just a bunch of crazy people who don't make sense.
[3909.08 → 3910.46] Maybe none of this makes sense.
[3910.46 → 3913.06] And if that's true for you or for the people in your life,
[3913.38 → 3916.42] I want you to pray verse 16 with me.
[3917.24 → 3917.38] Right?
[3917.48 → 3921.02] Blessed are your eyes because they see and your ears because they hear.
[3921.02 → 3921.54] Right?
[3921.68 → 3927.88] Lord, give us eyes to see and ears to hear the beautiful mystery of the gospel
[3927.88 → 3932.54] And to be compelled by the beautiful majesty of your kingdom.
[3932.96 → 3933.16] Right?
[3933.22 → 3934.68] This is our prayer.
[3936.36 → 3936.86] Jesus says,
[3937.06 → 3938.74] I will open my mouth in parables.
[3938.90 → 3942.68] I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world.
[3942.84 → 3946.10] And so this will be our challenge for us this summer.
[3946.80 → 3950.42] How do we see past the surface meaning,
[3950.76 → 3952.88] Usually the easy moralism,
[3953.24 → 3953.42] Right?
[3953.42 → 3958.82] To the deeper, more mysterious meaning that Jesus intends for his disciple.
[3959.56 → 3960.66] Or to put it another way,
[3960.98 → 3966.94] What is the uniquely Christian gospel identity forming meaning to each parable?
[3968.54 → 3971.52] Now Jesus tells us that he speaks in parables
[3971.52 → 3975.68] In order to illustrate that there are those who get it
[3975.68 → 3978.50] And those who don't, who won't.
[3979.32 → 3982.68] My prayer for us this summer is that we are among those who do.
[3983.42 → 3989.78] And so now to the parable of the mustard seed and the yeast in bread.
[3990.56 → 3991.98] Now from the very beginning,
[3992.68 → 3999.56] Jesus tells us what sort of category these two parables belong to.
[3999.82 → 3999.92] Right?
[3999.94 → 4000.06] He says,
[4000.24 → 4003.12] The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed.
[4003.22 → 4005.82] The kingdom of heaven is like yeast.
[4006.26 → 4006.40] Right?
[4006.42 → 4009.28] These are what we'll call kingdom parables.
[4009.54 → 4011.66] But notice, notice the tense.
[4011.66 → 4012.26] Right?
[4012.34 → 4013.90] So a little bit of grammar for you this morning.
[4014.02 → 4015.90] Notice the tense that Jesus is using.
[4016.38 → 4019.68] The kingdom of heaven is like.
[4020.74 → 4021.84] Not will be.
[4022.82 → 4023.02] Right?
[4023.06 → 4025.06] It's present tense.
[4025.30 → 4026.96] Not future tense.
[4027.26 → 4027.34] Right?
[4027.40 → 4032.68] These parables are about present, current, or concurrent realities.
[4032.88 → 4036.86] Kingdom realities in the here and now because of Jesus coming.
[4036.86 → 4043.48] If you have your Bibles open, and you jump a couple pages forward, more than a couple,
[4043.60 → 4045.38] to the beginning of the Gospel of Mark.
[4046.02 → 4049.66] The beginning of the Gospel of Mark in verse 15.
[4049.92 → 4054.68] These are the very first words that Jesus speaks in Mark's Gospel.
[4054.80 → 4057.52] The very first thing that Jesus says in the Gospel of Mark,
[4057.52 → 4059.16] The time has come.
[4059.92 → 4062.50] The kingdom of God has come near.
[4063.28 → 4065.90] Repent and believe the good news.
[4067.40 → 4072.26] The kingdom of God has come near.
[4073.40 → 4075.74] Jesus has started something.
[4076.82 → 4080.20] Jesus coming means something new in the world.
[4080.20 → 4085.46] I love the way that Klein Snodgrass summarizes it.
[4085.76 → 4086.12] He says,
[4086.88 → 4089.20] The end is already in the beginning.
[4091.00 → 4093.18] The end is already in the beginning.
[4093.56 → 4093.64] Right?
[4093.70 → 4099.82] This parable is about reframing expectations of what the kingdom should be.
[4100.12 → 4101.16] Of what it would be.
[4102.04 → 4102.16] Right?
[4102.20 → 4108.46] The disciples, and really, probably all the contemporary Jews of Jesus' day,
[4108.46 → 4112.06] would have said something along the lines of,
[4113.02 → 4117.40] Isn't the kingdom of heaven supposed to be a big display of God's power?
[4118.12 → 4118.24] Right?
[4118.28 → 4122.44] Isn't Rome supposed to be cast off and Israel restored?
[4122.82 → 4125.18] Shouldn't this new Babylon be destroyed?
[4125.78 → 4129.10] Aren't we supposed to have, you know, the prophet Malachi says,
[4129.24 → 4133.42] storehouses overflowing and milk and honey pouring down?
[4133.42 → 4134.02] Right?
[4136.02 → 4140.66] That's the question of this new kingdom economy.
[4141.84 → 4142.00] Right?
[4142.48 → 4147.64] If that was the expectation, what they saw was something vastly different.
[4148.50 → 4148.64] Right?
[4148.68 → 4156.48] How on earth, or even how in heaven, is a bunch of ragtag misfits and a rabbi from Nazareth?
[4156.60 → 4161.38] You remember the words, the question, can anything good come from Nazareth?
[4161.38 → 4161.88] Right?
[4161.88 → 4162.60] Right?
[4162.66 → 4166.06] How is this ragtag bunch of misfits and this rabbi from Nazareth,
[4166.26 → 4170.48] how are they heralding this kingdom of heaven?
[4171.26 → 4171.38] Right?
[4171.38 → 4173.46] The people expected great things.
[4173.80 → 4175.52] They expected wars and destruction.
[4175.96 → 4179.62] They expected a new king in the line of David on the throne in Jerusalem.
[4179.62 → 4183.36] And what they got was an itinerant preacher who ended up on a cross.
[4185.30 → 4191.58] Now, in our culture, right, we have similar, if not exactly the same, expectations.
[4192.16 → 4196.64] And really, let's be clear here, not just outside the church, right, we are affected,
[4196.86 → 4198.46] or maybe infected is the better word.
[4198.70 → 4200.70] We are affected by it too.
[4200.70 → 4209.08] How many times have you heard it said, right, if your God was real, why would there be pain in the world?
[4210.28 → 4213.94] If your God was real, why is there still evil in the world?
[4214.12 → 4217.04] If your God is good, why is there still suffering?
[4219.28 → 4219.42] Right?
[4219.50 → 4226.10] The idea being that if the kingdom of God was real, if God was real, if the kingdom was really present,
[4226.46 → 4227.88] wouldn't it all be all good?
[4227.88 → 4227.92] Right?
[4229.82 → 4233.42] And like I said, there's a Christian version of this too.
[4234.58 → 4234.78] Right?
[4234.80 → 4241.70] Not one that necessarily denies the existence of God, but does something different, changes our relationship to God.
[4241.94 → 4242.10] Right?
[4242.18 → 4247.92] Sometimes, we believe, and we may never say it, but we functionally act this way.
[4248.18 → 4248.38] Right?
[4248.40 → 4255.18] We believe that because we have done everything right, or we have tried, at least, to do everything right,
[4255.18 → 4257.86] we've checked the right boxes, we've gone to church,
[4257.88 → 4261.56] we've participated in a Bible study, we had Lord's Supper.
[4262.44 → 4262.80] Right?
[4262.88 → 4265.62] That we haven't sinned, or at least, we haven't sinned that bad.
[4266.08 → 4266.24] Right?
[4266.26 → 4267.64] Not as bad as that person anyway.
[4268.60 → 4268.80] Right?
[4268.84 → 4271.26] Because that's true, shouldn't I get this?
[4271.56 → 4273.16] Don't I deserve this, God?
[4274.32 → 4276.04] Can't you bless me with this?
[4277.50 → 4277.70] Right?
[4277.70 → 4285.18] So, we create this kind of like transactional Christian faith that isn't only ultimately consumerist,
[4285.48 → 4287.46] it's coercive.
[4288.82 → 4289.34] Right?
[4289.34 → 4296.08] Believing that you can bend God to your will rather than being bent to the will of God in your heart.
[4297.62 → 4302.84] I think both of these, the ones that deny God or the ones that try to coerce God,
[4303.02 → 4308.74] are modern versions of the old world problem that Jesus is addressing in this parable.
[4309.02 → 4309.18] Right?
[4309.18 → 4313.92] It's a problem of expectation, or a problem of misplaced expectations.
[4316.38 → 4327.68] Carl Sagan famously said, he's an astronomer and deeply atheist person, at least at this point in his life.
[4327.68 → 4333.76] He famously said, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.
[4335.46 → 4339.98] And so, where is the extraordinary evidence of the kingdom of God being at hand?
[4344.92 → 4345.72] Right?
[4345.72 → 4359.90] Now, one of the amazing things about this parable is that Matthew, as he structures his gospel,
[4360.18 → 4364.42] as he has written it, by the time that he gets to chapter 13, right,
[4364.46 → 4368.82] we've already seen Jesus do some pretty extraordinary miracles.
[4369.20 → 4371.04] You can flip back through the pages to see it.
[4371.32 → 4373.50] Jesus has already raised a dead girl.
[4374.24 → 4374.72] Right?
[4374.72 → 4376.28] He's already healed a sick woman.
[4376.74 → 4378.60] He's already healed a paralyzed man.
[4378.66 → 4381.90] He's already cast out demons from two possessed men.
[4381.90 → 4382.34] Right?
[4382.40 → 4387.20] He's already stood on the waves in the storm on the Sea of Galilee and said,
[4387.38 → 4389.76] be calm, be still, and stopped it.
[4390.46 → 4393.62] Jesus has already worked all of these incredible miracles,
[4394.06 → 4398.94] but that wasn't enough evidence for the truth of the kingdom come and the kingdom coming.
[4399.98 → 4400.10] Right?
[4400.10 → 4400.88] Think about that.
[4401.12 → 4401.24] Right?
[4401.30 → 4404.44] Stories of the dead being raised, of storms being calmed,
[4404.44 → 4411.34] of demons being cast out, aren't enough to overcome the foolishness and the stumbling block nature of the gospel.
[4411.62 → 4411.94] Right?
[4411.98 → 4414.10] People are still looking at Jesus and going, nope.
[4414.82 → 4416.00] That doesn't make sense.
[4416.00 → 4419.54] The same is true today.
[4419.54 → 4420.02] Right?
[4420.02 → 4423.06] People have talked to me before, and they said,
[4424.06 → 4427.94] Pastor, I don't understand why God didn't heal this person.
[4429.16 → 4429.36] Right?
[4429.36 → 4439.50] We heard a story from someone who was at a camp and there was a girl there who had terminal illness and the whole group of people prayed over her.
[4439.98 → 4446.26] And they all left utterly convicted and convinced that God was going to heal her and give her new life.
[4446.66 → 4447.80] Three weeks later, she died.
[4447.80 → 4450.42] And he said to me,
[4450.42 → 4453.52] Pastor, why didn't God heal that little girl?
[4454.96 → 4457.82] Or think about the amazing things that would have happened if God healed her.
[4458.26 → 4459.94] All of those people there would have believed.
[4460.34 → 4462.86] How could they not believe seeing God work so powerfully?
[4462.86 → 4467.56] The testimony of the New Testament is exactly the opposite.
[4468.20 → 4469.14] That it's just not enough.
[4469.50 → 4472.54] No matter how many miracles you see, it's just not enough.
[4472.62 → 4477.48] Because our expectations of what Jesus is doing are vastly different from what Jesus is doing.
[4477.56 → 4479.22] We think we know what he ought to do.
[4479.54 → 4481.08] Jesus does what must be done.
[4484.22 → 4485.26] Jesus is saying,
[4486.26 → 4488.40] it doesn't make sense.
[4490.28 → 4490.72] Unless,
[4490.72 → 4493.26] unless you know me.
[4494.52 → 4495.78] Unless you see me.
[4497.06 → 4497.88] Jesus is saying,
[4498.12 → 4500.36] from such small beginnings.
[4500.88 → 4503.96] This ragtag bunch of misfits and a rabbi from Nazareth.
[4504.10 → 4508.20] Such small beginnings come great and impossible things.
[4508.52 → 4511.72] Jesus is ushering in the beginning of the kingdom.
[4511.94 → 4514.22] Not with a loud bang or clashing armies.
[4514.58 → 4516.20] Not with milk and honey flowing.
[4516.36 → 4518.16] But with an almost unnoticed,
[4518.16 → 4519.96] in fact, it was missed by most.
[4520.46 → 4522.44] Presence of God.
[4523.86 → 4526.72] The end is already present in the beginning.
[4527.18 → 4531.04] History is changed by his word and work.
[4531.16 → 4534.06] The kingdom is already here, and it will not be stopped.
[4534.40 → 4540.28] What started as a mustard seed grows into a large tree that is big enough for birds to live in.
[4540.28 → 4543.66] What started with an almost imperceptible truth.
[4543.66 → 4547.00] Like yeast mixed into 60 pounds of dough.
[4547.20 → 4548.58] You can't even see it.
[4549.28 → 4551.50] But its effect is profound.
[4551.50 → 4555.52] And to be really clear.
[4557.20 → 4560.54] This is exactly what happened.
[4561.20 → 4563.50] This is exactly what happened in history.
[4563.66 → 4563.72] Right?
[4563.80 → 4567.58] This ragtag bunch of misfits and this rabbi from Nazareth started a movement.
[4567.92 → 4570.42] And that movement was called The Way at first.
[4570.52 → 4572.48] But later it became called Christianity.
[4573.04 → 4577.56] And that grew and is growing exponentially around the world.
[4577.56 → 4582.74] Rodney Stark has a book called The Rise of Christianity.
[4583.24 → 4585.58] He estimates that in 40 AD.
[4586.56 → 4586.74] Right?
[4586.84 → 4590.36] After around 40 AD.
[4590.56 → 4591.66] So numbers are loose here.
[4591.82 → 4591.94] Right?
[4592.00 → 4594.52] There are approximately a thousand Christians.
[4595.84 → 4598.44] Now all of these Christians would be Palestinian Jews.
[4599.12 → 4601.28] And so there's another scholar, James Jeffery.
[4601.28 → 4607.68] He estimates that there are 2.5 million Jews who lived in Palestine at the time of Jesus.
[4607.98 → 4613.48] That means that 0.04% became believers.
[4614.60 → 4616.58] That's a micro demographic.
[4616.80 → 4621.74] Like that's barely registered on any Canadian census data.
[4622.74 → 4629.24] And yet by 200 AD there are 2 million in the Roman Empire.
[4629.24 → 4636.04] By 300 AD there's over 6 million Christians throughout the empire.
[4636.18 → 4637.40] Throughout the known world.
[4638.10 → 4641.68] That's what a mustard seed movement looks like.
[4643.98 → 4645.48] The gospel is this.
[4647.00 → 4649.50] That Jesus came and lived the life I should have lived.
[4649.58 → 4651.94] That Jesus died the death that I deserve.
[4652.08 → 4657.32] That Jesus came and lived the life of perfect obedience for all who would believe.
[4657.32 → 4663.96] And he died the death of the wrath of God for sins for all who would be called by grace through faith.
[4664.32 → 4669.26] And though he died he was raised 3 days later victorious now over sin and death.
[4669.40 → 4675.86] And though he died being raised 3 days later 40 days after that he ascended to the right hand of God the Father.
[4676.06 → 4679.90] Where he sits on the throne as king of the universe.
[4679.90 → 4683.06] Where he has been given the name that is above every name.
[4683.06 → 4686.82] The gospel is Jesus is king.
[4687.06 → 4690.88] And the gospel is the kingdom come and the kingdom coming.
[4691.24 → 4694.58] The gospel is from such humble beginnings.
[4695.08 → 4701.58] And becomes the very greatness and glory of God revealed to the world.
[4701.58 → 4717.56] And so gospel living is you and me full of hope and expectation and rejoicing and urgency at the truth of this message.
[4718.02 → 4718.26] Right?
[4718.32 → 4720.20] That we all might know and see.
[4720.32 → 4722.20] That we all might hear and understand.
[4722.36 → 4724.42] No matter how dark the night gets.
[4724.74 → 4725.88] We have hope.
[4725.88 → 4727.96] Right?
[4728.00 → 4731.26] We have hope that his mercies are new every morning.
[4731.78 → 4733.92] No matter how hard life gets.
[4734.06 → 4737.92] We have hope that God is greater than all of our challenges.
[4738.72 → 4740.88] Yes in this world you will have trouble.
[4741.18 → 4744.12] But we know and believe that Jesus has overcome the world.
[4744.48 → 4744.58] Right?
[4744.66 → 4747.90] Even when it looks like the powers and principalities.
[4747.90 → 4752.04] When it looks like the emperors and the empires of the world are winning.
[4752.30 → 4757.42] We know that God has already won the victory in Jesus Christ our Lord.
[4757.48 → 4757.68] Amen?
[4757.68 → 4757.82] Amen?
[4759.82 → 4761.14] And so maybe.
[4762.64 → 4763.84] Just maybe.
[4764.80 → 4769.18] This post-Christian world that we are increasingly finding ourselves in.
[4769.44 → 4772.86] Is exactly what the church needs.
[4773.00 → 4777.40] For this mustard seed faith to come to new fruition.
[4777.90 → 4789.34] Parable of the mustard seed and of yeast.
[4789.34 → 4795.32] Is a story to make a theological point out of the world around us.
[4796.82 → 4803.92] To identify us as a people of hope.
[4803.92 → 4807.20] And so no matter where you go.
[4807.34 → 4809.14] No matter what you face.
[4809.88 → 4814.94] Know that God himself goes with you.
[4815.74 → 4819.44] That the kingdom of God has come.
[4821.30 → 4824.64] May it come in our hearts more and more.
[4824.86 → 4828.26] And may it come in fullness in the return of Jesus Christ.
[4828.80 → 4830.62] Soon and very soon.
[4831.14 → 4831.90] Let's pray together.
[4831.90 → 4841.78] Holy God.
[4841.84 → 4842.40] Heavenly Father.
[4842.40 → 4848.36] May we have eyes to see and ears to hear your kingdom come and coming today.
[4848.56 → 4853.04] Grant us hope in this dark night.
[4853.04 → 4858.62] Grant us faith in the midst of our doubts.
[4861.14 → 4865.46] Grant us rejoicing alongside of our mourning.
[4867.82 → 4872.68] Grant us holiness out of our brokenness.
[4872.68 → 4876.24] Lord Jesus.
[4876.24 → 4878.30] Grant us yourself.
[4878.92 → 4879.48] Today.
[4880.78 → 4882.56] That we might be found in you.
[4882.70 → 4885.86] And that we this week might go with you.
[4886.24 → 4886.82] To the world.
[4887.54 → 4889.96] To proclaim your kingdom come and your kingdom coming.
[4890.40 → 4893.04] To proclaim Jesus Christ alone.
[4893.62 → 4894.34] As Lord.
[4895.00 → 4895.66] And God.
[4895.66 → 4897.22] In his name we pray.
[4897.98 → 4898.36] Amen.
[4902.36 → 4904.36] For that journey of faith.
[4904.70 → 4907.08] That we are about to embark on.
[4907.22 → 4908.20] Or continue in.
[4909.02 → 4910.52] God grants us.
[4910.76 → 4912.08] This meal of grace.
[4912.52 → 4914.54] That we might come to his table.
[4915.40 → 4916.72] Be found by him.
[4917.10 → 4917.52] Here.
[4918.04 → 4919.74] And that we might be strengthened.
[4919.74 → 4921.10] And nourished.
[4921.42 → 4922.72] For this journey of faith.
[4924.10 → 4925.06] Jesus Christ.
[4925.20 → 4926.60] Before he suffered.
[4927.36 → 4928.92] Gave us this memorial.
[4928.92 → 4930.86] Of his sacrifice.
[4931.56 → 4932.86] Until he comes again.
[4933.78 → 4934.66] And the Lord Jesus.
[4935.00 → 4936.64] On the night that he was betrayed.
[4936.88 → 4937.60] Took bread.
[4937.60 → 4939.82] And when he had given thanks.
[4940.00 → 4940.76] He broke it.
[4940.90 → 4941.16] And said.
[4941.48 → 4942.64] This is my body.
[4942.88 → 4944.06] Which is for you.
[4945.42 → 4946.14] Do this.
[4946.52 → 4947.18] In remembrance.
[4947.96 → 4948.40] Of me.
[4949.74 → 4951.02] And in the same way.
[4951.20 → 4952.14] After supper.
[4952.34 → 4953.22] He took the cup.
[4953.34 → 4953.62] Saying.
[4954.20 → 4954.90] This cup.
[4955.16 → 4956.16] Is the new covenant.
[4956.76 → 4957.56] In my blood.
[4958.48 → 4959.20] Do this.
[4959.38 → 4960.04] In remembrance.
[4960.72 → 4961.24] Of me.
[4962.30 → 4964.00] For whenever we eat this bread.
[4964.12 → 4965.34] And drink this cup.
[4965.44 → 4966.14] We proclaim.
[4966.28 → 4967.12] The Lord's death.
[4967.48 → 4968.86] Until he comes again.
[4969.98 → 4970.58] This.
[4970.84 → 4972.04] Is the mystery.
[4972.70 → 4973.60] Of our faith.
[4976.70 → 4977.62] Your death.
[4977.84 → 4978.42] Oh Christ.
[4978.62 → 4979.30] We proclaim.
[4979.74 → 4981.10] Your resurrection.
[4981.62 → 4982.12] We affirm.
[4982.26 → 4982.78] With joy.
[4983.72 → 4984.40] Your coming.
[4984.74 → 4985.20] We wait.
[4985.32 → 4985.84] With hope.
[4986.70 → 4988.10] Glory be to you.
[4988.22 → 4988.90] Lord Jesus.
[4991.04 → 4991.94] Church family.
[4992.06 → 4993.06] The Lord has prepared.
[4993.06 → 4993.94] His table.
[4994.14 → 4995.30] For all who love him.
[4995.38 → 4996.72] And who trust in him.
[4996.98 → 4997.50] Alone.
[4997.66 → 4998.64] For their salvation.
[4999.72 → 5000.20] And so.
[5000.46 → 5001.56] Come to this table.
[5001.78 → 5003.82] You who have much faith.
[5003.96 → 5006.32] And you who would like to have more.
[5006.80 → 5007.66] Come to this table.
[5007.66 → 5009.74] You who have been to this sacrament often.
[5009.88 → 5012.62] And you who have not been for a long time.
[5012.78 → 5014.54] You who have tried to follow Jesus.
[5014.78 → 5016.04] And you who have failed.
[5016.20 → 5017.60] Come to this table.
[5017.86 → 5020.70] Because Jesus is king.
[5022.28 → 5023.36] Come to this table.
[5023.40 → 5024.92] If you are here present with us.
[5024.98 → 5027.80] Or if you are participating this morning online.
[5028.60 → 5028.92] Come.
[5028.92 → 5031.84] It is Christ who invites us.
[5032.04 → 5033.42] It is Christ himself.
[5033.84 → 5035.32] Who we meet here.
[5036.44 → 5038.56] These are the gifts of God.
[5038.92 → 5040.80] For the people of God.
[5042.34 → 5044.14] As we come to the table this morning.
[5045.18 → 5047.12] We're going to gather at the front.
[5047.32 → 5048.52] Around the table.
[5049.16 → 5051.50] The elders will be here present to help serve.
[5051.72 → 5052.38] And there will be.
[5052.46 → 5054.34] I think deacons in the aisles.
[5054.34 → 5058.10] Usher's who will tell you when your time to come to the front is.
[5058.90 → 5060.24] As you come to the front.
[5060.48 → 5063.34] I will pass the tray to my left and to my right.
[5063.40 → 5065.20] And the elders will start in the opposite direction.
[5065.48 → 5067.76] As you pass the elements to the person beside you.
[5067.84 → 5068.90] We invite you to say.
[5069.08 → 5070.88] The body of Christ given for you.
[5071.06 → 5073.38] The blood of Christ shed for you.
[5074.02 → 5075.64] As you pass each element.
[5075.86 → 5077.74] The first group who is going to come to the front.
[5077.82 → 5078.74] Is the worship team.
[5079.48 → 5080.62] And those at the back.
[5080.62 → 5082.86] And then they will lead us with music.
[5083.08 → 5085.14] Through the rest of our time together.
[5085.24 → 5087.08] So I'm going to invite the worship team.
[5087.40 → 5088.28] To come up to the front.
[5089.50 → 5090.16] And those who.
[5091.80 → 5092.20] Yeah.
[5092.30 → 5092.70] Very good.
[5110.62 → 5112.44] If you are unable to come to the front.
[5112.68 → 5114.26] We will serve you in your seat.
[5114.36 → 5117.08] So please just indicate to the ushers in the aisles.
[5117.22 → 5119.44] And they will bring the elements to you.
[5121.94 → 5123.52] The body of Christ given for you.
[5126.90 → 5128.38] The body of Christ given for you.

[5163.48 → 5163.74] Eat.
[5164.36 → 5164.86] And remember.
