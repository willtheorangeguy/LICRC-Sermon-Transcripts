[746.88 --> 753.76]  oh great i love it excellent welcome to worship my name is chris i'm one of the
[753.76 --> 757.44]  pastors here and if you're visiting with us this morning thank you
[757.44 --> 761.04]  for joining us here if you're visiting online thank you for
[761.04 --> 764.64]  checking us out uh before we continue in worship there's a couple
[764.64 --> 769.20]  announcements that we want to make and remind you of and so
[769.20 --> 773.68]  first of all as you have no doubt heard since it's
[773.68 --> 778.88]  everywhere this past week bc began making some changes to the
[778.88 --> 782.80]  requirements and restrictions around managing covet and things like that
[784.64 --> 788.08]  and yet none of those changes affect us here yet
[788.88 --> 791.92]  and so just a reminder to continue wearing your mask and
[791.92 --> 796.08]  uh keep that on properly and over your nose as is appropriate
[796.08 --> 802.64]  and the like so that we can continue to worship well together as a community
[802.64 --> 809.84]  next to that um as we are increasingly returning to a more normal experience of
[809.84 --> 813.36]  life and worship together we're looking to relaunch a couple things
[813.36 --> 820.24]  uh and so uh for the past while you've seen elders or myself or pastor kevin lead in the
[820.24 --> 824.56]  church family prayer we want some others to have opportunity to do that as well
[825.20 --> 829.44]  and so if you're interested in leading the church family prayer in our shared worship
[829.44 --> 832.80]  together please grab me after the service i'll write your name down
[832.80 --> 838.64]  and we'll add you to that rotation list as it goes forward as well we're looking to
[838.64 --> 846.48]  uh relaunch the prayer team ministry and so uh during our service and following our service
[846.48 --> 850.56]  there'd be people who are wearing name tags kind of like this who are available for prayer
[850.56 --> 856.08]  and so if you want someone to connect with and to pray with you they would be available around
[856.08 --> 859.76]  and here present for you and so if that's something you've done in the past or something
[859.76 --> 865.36]  you would like to maybe lean into and try in the season going forward grab me again after
[865.36 --> 873.04]  the service i'll take your name and write you on that list finally just a reminder that our church

[898.72 --> 906.72]  that this is a virtual event and yet as a church community participating we want to walk together

[1280.22 --> 1283.22]  We're worthy of every song we could ever sing.
[1283.22 --> 1285.22]  Worthy of all the praise we could ever bring.
[1285.22 --> 1287.22]  We're worthy of every breath we could ever breathe.
[1287.22 --> 1289.22]  We live for you.
[1289.22 --> 1290.22]  We live for you.

[1343.70 --> 1346.22]  There is none beside you.

[1352.52 --> 1356.14]  And show me who you are.
[1356.28 --> 1359.22]  And fill me with your heart.

[1419.02 --> 1423.14]  And show me who you are.
[1423.14 --> 1426.86]  And fill me with your heart.
[1426.86 --> 1434.22]  And lead me in your love to those around me.
[1434.22 --> 1456.22]  I will build my life upon your love.
[1456.22 --> 1462.22]  It is a firm foundation.
[1462.22 --> 1471.22]  And I will put my trust in you alone.
[1471.22 --> 1477.18]  And I will not be shaken.
[1477.18 --> 1485.18]  I will build my life upon your love.
[1485.18 --> 1485.76]  I will build my life upon your love.
[1485.76 --> 1491.52]  It is a firm foundation.
[1491.52 --> 1500.10]  I will put my trust in you alone.
[1500.10 --> 1507.10]  And I will not be shaken and holy.
[1507.10 --> 1511.64]  There is no one like you.
[1511.64 --> 1515.48]  There is none beside you.
[1515.48 --> 1520.60]  Open up my eyes in wonder.
[1520.60 --> 1524.60]  And show me who you are.

[1535.22 --> 1537.22]  And lead me in your love to those around me.
[1537.22 --> 1540.60]  Holy, there is no one like you.
[1540.60 --> 1544.22]  There is none beside you.
[1544.22 --> 1549.06]  Open up my eyes in wonder.
[1549.06 --> 1552.98]  And show me who you are.
[1552.98 --> 1555.98]  And fill me with your heart.
[1555.98 --> 1565.98]  And lead me in your love to those around me.
[1565.98 --> 1572.98]  Psalm 139 verse 23 says, search me, oh God.
[1572.98 --> 1574.98]  And know my heart.
[1574.98 --> 1577.98]  Test me and know my anxious thoughts.
[1577.98 --> 1583.98]  Another translation says, God, see what is in my heart.
[1583.98 --> 1584.98]  Know what is there.
[1584.98 --> 1585.98]  Test me.
[1585.98 --> 1588.98]  Know what I'm thinking.
[1588.98 --> 1593.98]  Pastor Chris and Kevin have really challenged us through the bulletin in these last few weeks.
[1593.98 --> 1605.98]  I wonder how many of us are ready to share visually by photography what is distracting, preventing, and claiming our affections from worship.
[1605.98 --> 1609.98]  Honestly, what has been capturing your heart?
[1609.98 --> 1612.98]  Taking God's rightful place.
[1612.98 --> 1615.98]  What is claiming your affections?
[1615.98 --> 1629.98]  Can we lay that down at the foot of the cross and let him renew the sense of awe we had when we first realized how loved we are by God?
[1629.98 --> 1631.98]  Pray with me.
[1631.98 --> 1632.98]  Father in heaven.
[1632.98 --> 1650.98]  In Psalm 51, David says, create in me a clean heart, a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.
[1650.98 --> 1659.98]  Do not cast me from your presence or take your Holy Spirit from me.
[1659.98 --> 1671.98]  Restore to me the joy of your salvation and grant a willing heart and spirit to sustain me.
[1671.98 --> 1672.98]  Help us to recognize the counterfeit.
[1672.98 --> 1675.98]  Help us to recognize the counterfeit.
[1675.98 --> 1680.98]  And help us to give you the rightful place in our hearts.
[1680.98 --> 1684.98]  Forgive us for allowing any other to replace you.
[1684.98 --> 1691.98]  Thank you for offering us your rest as we come to you.
[1691.98 --> 1694.98]  You are beautiful.
[1694.98 --> 1696.98]  Amen.
[1696.98 --> 1724.98]  Beautiful Savior, King of creation,
[1724.98 --> 1738.98]  Son of God and Son of Man.
[1738.98 --> 1743.98]  Truly I love thee.
[1743.98 --> 1748.98]  Truly I serve thee.
[1748.98 --> 1758.98]  Light of my soul, my joy, my crown.
[1758.98 --> 1760.98]  Yeah.
[1760.98 --> 1770.98]  Fair are the meadows, fair are the woodlands,
[1770.98 --> 1780.98]  Rope dead flowers of blooming spring.
[1780.98 --> 1785.98]  Jesus is fairer.
[1785.98 --> 1790.98]  Jesus is purer.
[1790.98 --> 1802.98]  He makes our soaring spirits sing.
[1802.98 --> 1812.98]  Fair is the sunshine, fair is the moonlight,
[1812.98 --> 1822.98]  Bright the sparkling stars of night.
[1822.98 --> 1827.98]  Jesus shines brighter.
[1827.98 --> 1832.98]  Jesus shines purer.
[1832.98 --> 1844.98]  Than all the angels in the sky.
[1844.98 --> 1850.98]  Beautiful Savior, Lord of the nations,
[1850.98 --> 1864.98]  Son of God and Son of Man.
[1864.98 --> 1874.98]  Glory and honor, praise and adoration.
[1874.98 --> 1886.98]  Now and forevermore be thine.
[1886.98 --> 1888.98]  I invite you to be seated.
[1888.98 --> 1904.98]  Good morning.
[1904.98 --> 1905.98]  Good morning.
[1905.98 --> 1906.98]  Good morning, all you're listening.
[1906.98 --> 1911.98]  We continue our worship with the giving of our gifts for the budget,
[1911.98 --> 1916.98]  which covers the administration of the church and its ministries
[1916.98 --> 1921.98]  and the special offering for Reframe Ministries.
[1921.98 --> 1927.98]  Reframe Ministries began in 1939 under the name Back to God Hour,
[1927.98 --> 1929.98]  with the three-fold mission.
[1929.98 --> 1932.88]  proclaim that Jesus Christ is Lord,
[1933.70 --> 1936.16]  help followers of Jesus grow in their faith,
[1936.74 --> 1938.06]  and strengthen the church.
[1939.10 --> 1941.38]  The Back to God Ministries changed their name
[1941.38 --> 1943.48]  to Reframe Ministries last year,
[1944.02 --> 1947.32]  reflecting the changes in media over the years.
[1948.36 --> 1952.20]  God's story doesn't change, but today's media has changed.
[1952.94 --> 1956.94]  Technology is the fastest, most cost-effective way
[1956.94 --> 1960.14]  to reach the most people at any given time.
[1961.82 --> 1965.86]  Reframe Ministries sends God's story around the world
[1965.86 --> 1969.88]  using radio, television, internet, and smartphones
[1969.88 --> 1975.80]  in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Hindi, Russian,
[1975.80 --> 1979.44]  Portuguese, Japanese, and Indonesian
[1979.44 --> 1983.28]  through 86 gospel-centered programs
[1983.28 --> 1988.96]  and 233,000 devotional emails are sent daily.
[1989.82 --> 1991.70]  Tens of thousands of people interact
[1991.70 --> 1996.00]  with the 67 different social media sites each month.
[1997.36 --> 2003.38]  And Reframe Ministries reaches over 500,000 people
[2003.38 --> 2005.84]  through video monthly.
[2006.76 --> 2008.62]  Your prayers have an impact.
[2008.62 --> 2012.64]  Reframe Ministries asks for volunteers to pray
[2012.64 --> 2015.42]  for people who have not yet heard the gospel
[2015.42 --> 2018.64]  and pray that God will use Reframe Ministries
[2018.64 --> 2021.20]  to help grow the church worldwide.
[2022.16 --> 2024.54]  For more information on Reframe Ministries,
[2025.10 --> 2030.14]  go to their website at www.reframeministries.org.
[2030.14 --> 2033.48]  Honour the Lord with your wealth
[2033.48 --> 2035.68]  and with the firstfruits of all your produce.
[2036.30 --> 2038.20]  Then your barns will be filled with plenty
[2038.20 --> 2041.02]  and your vats will be bursting with wine.
[2041.70 --> 2043.62]  Proverbs 3, 9, and 10.
[2044.76 --> 2046.90]  Next week's offering is for the Budget
[2046.90 --> 2048.86]  and Resonate Global Missions.
[2048.86 --> 2049.86]  Thank you.
[2049.86 --> 2050.86]  Thank you.
[2050.86 --> 2051.86]  Thank you.
[2051.86 --> 2052.86]  Thank you.
[2052.86 --> 2053.86]  Thank you.
[2053.86 --> 2054.86]  Thank you.
[2054.86 --> 2055.86]  Thank you.
[2055.86 --> 2056.86]  Thank you.
[2056.86 --> 2057.86]  Thank you.
[2057.86 --> 2058.86]  Thank you.
[2058.86 --> 2059.86]  Thank you.
[2060.14 --> 2084.86]  Thank you.
[2084.86 --> 2087.86]  This is the air I breathe.
[2087.86 --> 2089.86]  Thank you.
[2089.86 --> 2094.86]  This is the air I breathe.
[2094.86 --> 2106.86]  Your holy presence living in me.
[2106.86 --> 2107.86]  Thank you.
[2107.86 --> 2108.86]  Thank you.
[2108.86 --> 2109.86]  Thank you.
[2109.86 --> 2114.86]  This is my daily bread.
[2114.86 --> 2121.86]  This is my daily bread.
[2121.86 --> 2133.86]  Your very word spoken to me.
[2133.86 --> 2140.86]  And I'm desperate for you.
[2140.86 --> 2144.86]  And I'm desperate for you.
[2144.86 --> 2148.86]  And I'm desperate for you.
[2148.86 --> 2158.86]  And I'm lost without you.
[2158.86 --> 2173.86]  I'm pity 211 p. I'm so sick.
[2173.86 --> 2175.86]  And I'm incapable of living in my body.
[2175.86 --> 2177.60]  Thank you.
[2177.86 --> 2180.86]  And I'm truly able to come to God and enjoy you.
[2180.86 --> 2181.86]  Chancinnisenter.
[2181.86 --> 2183.86]  Father, uncondthen Impe settler, choose not with you.
[2183.86 --> 2200.30]  This is the air I breathe, your holy presence living in me.
[2200.30 --> 2216.16]  This is my daily bread, this is my daily bread.
[2216.16 --> 2228.20]  Your very word spoken to me.
[2228.20 --> 2237.28]  And I, I'm desperate for you.
[2240.28 --> 2250.24]  And I, I'm lost without you.
[2250.24 --> 2263.44]  And I, I'm desperate for you.
[2265.94 --> 2275.88]  And I, I'm lost without you.
[2280.24 --> 2292.84]  You are the air I breathe.
[2295.84 --> 2299.60]  You are the air I breathe.
[2310.24 --> 2320.76]  All right, kids, come on up.
[2321.08 --> 2326.14]  Kids corner, if you're three, up to grade four, or anyone else who wants to, come on up.
[2326.14 --> 2342.84]  Everyone's so quiet today.
[2344.84 --> 2347.20]  All right, I have a little game that we're going to play.
[2348.30 --> 2350.58]  And in this game, I'm going to give you some clues.
[2351.10 --> 2354.78]  And I want you to try to guess who I'm talking about.
[2354.78 --> 2357.66]  So if you think you know, then put up your hand.
[2358.26 --> 2360.14]  And then we'll see if we can figure it out.
[2360.18 --> 2361.02]  You know already, Emma?
[2361.58 --> 2362.72]  Who do you think it is?
[2364.00 --> 2365.82]  God, that would be a great guess.
[2366.26 --> 2367.38]  We'll see if you're right.
[2368.24 --> 2373.46]  Okay, so the first clue, so I'm going to say it as an I, but I, I don't mean me.
[2373.52 --> 2374.10]  I'll give you that.
[2374.28 --> 2375.60]  So I'm pretending to be the person.
[2376.04 --> 2376.94]  I love summer.
[2380.06 --> 2380.46]  Allie.
[2382.04 --> 2382.40]  Olaf.
[2382.40 --> 2382.46]  Olaf.
[2383.18 --> 2384.54]  Well, that, that's right.
[2385.78 --> 2386.42]  That's right.
[2386.94 --> 2387.70]  Were you going to say that?
[2388.42 --> 2388.82]  No.
[2390.50 --> 2390.90]  Santa.
[2392.18 --> 2393.70]  Does Santa love summer?
[2394.24 --> 2396.28]  Probably because he gets a little bit of a break, right?
[2396.54 --> 2397.52]  He's too tired in the winter.
[2398.14 --> 2399.12]  Okay, well, it was Olaf.
[2399.34 --> 2400.30]  I had two other clues.
[2400.38 --> 2401.22]  I'll tell you what they were.
[2402.04 --> 2404.62]  The second one was carrots are my favorite smell.
[2406.94 --> 2408.02]  Well, it's still Olaf.
[2408.20 --> 2411.46]  I'm just telling you the clues because I thought of these all for a long time,
[2411.46 --> 2412.90]  and then you got it on the first one.
[2412.90 --> 2415.50]  The third one was I like warm hugs.
[2415.96 --> 2417.90]  That would have been an obvious one, right?
[2418.58 --> 2420.06]  Okay, so here's another one.
[2420.62 --> 2423.10]  The first clue is I have a sister.
[2425.78 --> 2426.22]  Zoe?
[2427.36 --> 2428.20]  Elsa and Anna.
[2428.62 --> 2429.46]  Elsa and Anna.
[2429.82 --> 2430.00]  Yeah.
[2430.28 --> 2431.52]  That isn't it this time.
[2431.62 --> 2432.42]  Do you have a guess?
[2432.94 --> 2433.96]  That's looking in my eye.
[2433.96 --> 2435.96]  Rosie?
[2437.40 --> 2438.58]  This could be a lot of people.
[2438.70 --> 2439.92]  I'm going to give you the second clue.
[2440.12 --> 2444.44]  The second clue is I like to chase cats.
[2447.40 --> 2448.02]  A dog?
[2448.08 --> 2448.80]  You think it's a dog?
[2450.00 --> 2454.40]  Okay, the third clue is I enjoy roller skating.
[2454.40 --> 2459.42]  Isla, do you know?
[2460.78 --> 2461.10]  Eden.
[2461.90 --> 2463.60]  Does she like to chase cats?
[2466.22 --> 2467.18]  Oh, Amara?
[2468.44 --> 2468.80]  Hank.
[2469.46 --> 2470.44]  Hank the Hound.
[2471.92 --> 2474.32]  My last clue was my name rhymes with tank.
[2474.58 --> 2476.10]  That would have given it away, wouldn't it?
[2476.90 --> 2477.32]  All right.
[2477.78 --> 2478.58]  Well, you guessed it.
[2478.62 --> 2478.74]  Good.
[2478.74 --> 2483.14]  I'm glad you guessed it because that was kind of the point is I gave you clues so that
[2483.14 --> 2486.24]  you would know who I'm talking about and who this person was.
[2486.48 --> 2489.28]  So in children's worship time, we've been talking about Jesus.
[2489.66 --> 2494.54]  And when he was on earth, what he did was he gave the people around him, his disciples
[2494.54 --> 2498.62]  and his followers, he was giving them clues about who he was.
[2499.20 --> 2502.08]  Some of those clues we're going to talk about or we have talked about.
[2502.26 --> 2506.52]  And today we're going to talk about one of those clues and it has to do with bread
[2506.52 --> 2507.34]  and fish.
[2507.34 --> 2512.76]  And you guys probably heard that story before, but that will be one of the clues we talk about
[2512.76 --> 2513.04]  today.
[2513.22 --> 2516.10]  So you can invite you to stand up, everyone, for the blessing.
[2537.34 --> 2562.92]  Good morning.
[2562.92 --> 2564.92]  Good morning.
[2564.92 --> 2568.34]  My name is John and I'm a pastoral elder here in church.
[2568.34 --> 2571.34]  And I would like to lead you in congregational prayer this morning.
[2571.34 --> 2581.34]  I want to share something personal with you before we go into prayer.
[2581.34 --> 2586.76]  yesterday would have been our son.
[2586.76 --> 2588.76]  David's 39th birthday.
[2588.76 --> 2589.76]  Was he here?
[2589.76 --> 2593.76]  But the Lord took him home a little over 17 years ago.
[2593.76 --> 2600.18]  And I don't bring this up just so that you know it would have been David's birthday.
[2600.18 --> 2614.60]  But it reminded me of, I'm going to say, not each of us perhaps, but many of us have grieved and struggled over various things in life over the years.
[2614.60 --> 2618.02]  And so often we go alone in our path and our walk.
[2618.02 --> 2628.02]  And it reminded me again yesterday how we need to support each other more and pray for each other more and care for each other more.
[2628.02 --> 2632.02]  And I am no better than anyone.
[2632.02 --> 2635.02]  In fact, I may be worse.
[2635.02 --> 2643.02]  But we need to pray for each other through our good times, but also through the times that we find challenging.
[2643.02 --> 2647.02]  And as we grieve, we too may come to the Lord.
[2647.02 --> 2651.44]  So I am going to want to lead you in prayer, and shall we do so at this time?
[2652.84 --> 2655.66]  Our Father in heaven, we bow our heads before you.
[2657.76 --> 2661.04]  Lord, we thank you for this day.
[2663.20 --> 2669.52]  We thank you, Lord, for bringing us here together as your children.
[2669.96 --> 2672.68]  And yet, Lord, we know that many of us are not here with us.
[2672.68 --> 2678.72]  And there are some, Lord, who are worshiping with us, live streaming online at this time.
[2678.82 --> 2680.86]  And, Lord, we pray for each of them also.
[2681.08 --> 2686.18]  And, Lord, you have promised us in your word also that where two or three are gathered in your name,
[2687.04 --> 2691.14]  that you are there also, Lord, even if we are by ourselves.
[2691.28 --> 2698.78]  May we then, too, know that even then you are there and that you bless us even at that time.
[2698.78 --> 2705.16]  And, Lord, may we each be blessed as we come together to worship you this morning.
[2705.26 --> 2707.94]  May your name be honored and glorified.
[2708.04 --> 2710.34]  May we do so in word and in song.
[2712.28 --> 2716.86]  Lord, may we leave this place being drawn closer to you.
[2716.86 --> 2729.32]  Lord, we have sung this morning also that you are holy and that, Lord, may we know you better.
[2729.44 --> 2731.08]  May we be filled with your wonder.
[2731.26 --> 2738.70]  Lord, we pray that in all that we do in our daily walk in life also that wherever we go that others may see, Lord,
[2738.74 --> 2741.74]  that you live in us and the words that we speak and in our actions.
[2741.74 --> 2748.12]  And, Lord, we pray, Lord, that each day again there would be many who turn their hearts to you.
[2750.40 --> 2760.48]  And, Lord, we know that through these COVID times that we have now also, Lord, as many of us tire of it,
[2760.48 --> 2774.40]  and, Lord, it becomes more challenging to show your love to those around us and to be who you want us to be, Lord.
[2774.44 --> 2781.92]  We pray that you would give us strength and wisdom through these times, Lord, that we may continually love others.
[2781.92 --> 2792.34]  Lord, we pray for Matt and Emily.
[2792.60 --> 2799.26]  Lord, we pray for Adam and Rachel, two young couples, Lord, who soon will become married.
[2801.74 --> 2808.54]  We pray, Lord, that each of them may seek you and that you would be a part of their families as well.
[2808.54 --> 2814.74]  Lord, you have told us through your word also that a strand of three is difficult to break.
[2816.54 --> 2821.02]  And, Lord, we pray that their lives, too, may be enriched by your spirit.
[2821.80 --> 2825.56]  Lord, we pray for Jared as he is in Costa Rica.
[2827.16 --> 2832.36]  Lord, preparing for mission work, we pray, Lord, that you would lead and guide him there also
[2832.36 --> 2839.12]  and that he too may seek you and all that he is doing there also.
[2839.28 --> 2841.70]  And may your light shine through him.
[2843.70 --> 2854.20]  Lord, we pray for Allison and her family, Lord, as they grieve the passing away of her father-in-law.
[2855.82 --> 2858.76]  Lord, they have had much to deal with over the last year.
[2858.76 --> 2859.76]  Lord, we pray for him.
[2859.76 --> 2860.76]  Lord, we pray for him.
[2860.76 --> 2861.76]  Lord, we pray for him.
[2861.76 --> 2863.60]  Lord, we pray that you would give them strength.
[2866.82 --> 2871.46]  Lord, may they stay focused on you through these difficult times.
[2874.14 --> 2879.32]  Lord, we pray also for Rachel.
[2880.44 --> 2883.00]  We pray for Judy and Diane.
[2883.12 --> 2883.86]  We pray for Emma.
[2883.86 --> 2888.18]  Lord, we know there are others in our church family also perhaps who struggle.
[2888.32 --> 2891.68]  We may not know them by name always, but you know them, Lord.
[2891.76 --> 2895.00]  We pray for each one that they may experience your healing touch.
[2896.12 --> 2898.80]  And, Lord, for many we have prayed for a long time.
[2898.96 --> 2903.60]  Yet, still, Lord, we come to you knowing that you are in control of all things
[2903.60 --> 2905.32]  and that you are able to do all things.
[2905.32 --> 2914.12]  Lord, we pray for the coolest night of the year event that's coming up this coming weekend.
[2916.38 --> 2920.48]  Lord, we thank you that our church may participate in this also.
[2920.64 --> 2928.86]  And we pray that the funds that may be raised, Lord, may be used well to spread and further your kingdom's work.
[2928.86 --> 2932.58]  Lord, we pray for the various ministries of our church.
[2933.38 --> 2935.66]  Lord, lead and guide each one.
[2937.26 --> 2942.56]  And, Lord, as the children come together this morning also for children's worship time,
[2942.72 --> 2943.60]  may they are too.
[2946.72 --> 2950.92]  May the little ones, Lord, be drawn close to you in their own simple ways.
[2951.04 --> 2953.98]  Lord, may they know you and may they love you.
[2954.50 --> 2956.84]  Because, Lord, we know that you love them.
[2956.84 --> 2962.54]  Lord, we pray for our church leadership.
[2964.54 --> 2965.66]  Pray for counsel.
[2965.96 --> 2970.08]  Lord, we pray for the various issues that come up from time to time.
[2970.66 --> 2977.78]  Lord, we pray for your spirit to lead us and guide us in wisdom and courage as we move forward.
[2981.08 --> 2985.18]  Lord, we pray for Pastor Chris this morning also as he leads us through your word.
[2985.18 --> 2987.68]  Lord, we pray, Lord, that as you give him the words to speak,
[2987.78 --> 2992.78]  that he may speak them clearly and boldly and that our hearts and eyes may be open to them.
[2998.24 --> 3003.56]  Lord, we pray that you would bless our worship this morning.
[3004.46 --> 3006.50]  We ask this, Lord, in your name.
[3007.20 --> 3007.54]  Amen.
[3015.18 --> 3031.88]  I'm just going to do some housekeeping for a minute.
[3036.88 --> 3040.52]  As beautiful as they are, they would be less so strewn all over the stage.
[3040.52 --> 3047.80]  This morning, we're going to continue in the book of Exodus.
[3048.10 --> 3052.74]  And I'm going to encourage you, if you have a Bible, to grab that, open it up.
[3052.82 --> 3058.00]  We're going to start reading together in Exodus 13.
[3059.12 --> 3060.40]  That will be on the screen.
[3061.04 --> 3066.34]  And then we'll read through to verse 22 of chapter 14.
[3066.34 --> 3067.98]  So have that ready.
[3069.06 --> 3073.84]  Before we do that, I want to convey an image to you as we come into this text.
[3076.60 --> 3078.76]  This is one of those texts that are very familiar.
[3079.18 --> 3085.14]  And so sometimes it's easy to make assumptions about that.
[3085.90 --> 3089.02]  But as we come into this text, I'm going to tell you a little story.
[3089.02 --> 3100.74]  As a teenager, there was a couple times, weekends, where I would go with my dad to his shop and push a broom for the day.
[3101.18 --> 3112.22]  Or I would paint pipes that had propane gas going through in yellow and others that had oxygen in green and ones that had water in blue.
[3112.64 --> 3113.22]  Dad, am I right?
[3113.34 --> 3114.60]  Did I remember that color correctly?
[3115.24 --> 3115.66]  Yes.
[3115.80 --> 3116.02]  Good.
[3116.02 --> 3116.06]  Good.
[3119.02 --> 3129.36]  Now, what you have to know, if you don't yet, when I was a teenager, my dad worked for a company that built simulators to train firefighters.
[3130.82 --> 3141.34]  So when people asked me what he did for a living, I said, well, my dad's job title is he is an electrical technician responsible for the design of fire simulation control modules.
[3142.28 --> 3143.76]  People would look at me, they go, what?
[3144.60 --> 3145.76]  I go, he's a pyromaniac.
[3146.30 --> 3147.78]  He gets to play with fire.
[3147.78 --> 3161.14]  And on one of the days that I was there, they had been working on a life-size scale model or representation of an oil tanker truck.
[3161.92 --> 3162.40]  Right?
[3162.52 --> 3165.20]  And that would travel under pressure on the road.
[3165.40 --> 3168.88]  And they had to simulate what would happen if this thing would catch on fire.
[3168.88 --> 3175.54]  Now, these tanker trucks travel under pressure and there's a pressure release valve on top.
[3175.80 --> 3185.02]  And if that fails and catches fire, it shoots a column of fire 60 feet or so into the air and about three feet wide.
[3185.16 --> 3189.92]  And that's what we got to test that day as a 17 or 18 year old in the shop.
[3189.92 --> 3198.24]  And dad told me I could stand at the control panel and turn it on so that they could be up close in their gear and watch what it looked like and then shut it off.
[3199.80 --> 3201.86]  Coolest job ever.
[3201.86 --> 3205.80]  I went home and they even paid me for it.
[3207.96 --> 3215.22]  Point is, there was this massive column of fire that shot up into the air.
[3215.30 --> 3222.10]  They had to call the fire department each time they would do a test just to say don't send the trucks because then they would have to pay for the trucks to come out.
[3222.10 --> 3231.66]  Now, whenever I read this story or when I hear about God leading the Israelites in a pillar of fire, right, we have maybe a small visual representation here.
[3231.88 --> 3232.94]  That's what I see.
[3233.76 --> 3240.00]  This giant, massive column of catastrophic fire burning up the sky.
[3242.46 --> 3244.10]  You probably have your own image.
[3244.10 --> 3251.94]  As we come into these stories, especially for those of us who have been raised in the church or in Christian communities, these are very familiar.
[3252.76 --> 3263.88]  And so I want to encourage you as we come into this text together to hear it and to visualize it with those images, yes, but wondering,
[3265.26 --> 3269.16]  what can God help me to see today?
[3270.32 --> 3272.94]  So with that in mind, let's read.
[3272.94 --> 3275.36]  I'm going to start at verse 20.
[3276.02 --> 3278.32]  So not verse 17, Linda, sorry.
[3279.82 --> 3283.78]  Start at verse 20 in chapter 13.
[3283.78 --> 3291.30]  After leaving Succoth, they camped at Etham on the edge of the desert.
[3292.34 --> 3303.26]  By day, the Lord went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud to guide them on their way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light so that they could travel by day or night.
[3304.14 --> 3309.66]  Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place in front of the people.
[3309.66 --> 3313.30]  Then the Lord said to Moses,
[3313.30 --> 3321.26]  Tell the Israelites to turn back and encamp near the Harreoth between Migdol and the sea.
[3321.26 --> 3325.86]  They are to camp by the sea directly opposite Baal-Zephon.
[3326.38 --> 3331.72]  And Pharaoh will think the Israelites are wandering around the land in confusion hemmed in by the desert.
[3332.44 --> 3335.68]  And I will harden Pharaoh's heart and he will pursue them.
[3336.22 --> 3343.72]  But I will gain glory for myself through Pharaoh and his army and the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord.
[3343.72 --> 3346.62]  So the Israelites did this.
[3347.78 --> 3350.76]  When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled,
[3351.12 --> 3355.56]  Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about them and said,
[3355.84 --> 3356.44]  What have we done?
[3357.06 --> 3360.00]  We've let the Israelites go and have lost their services.
[3361.10 --> 3365.72]  So he had his chariot made ready and took his army with him.
[3365.72 --> 3373.68]  He took 600 of his best chariots along with all the other chariots of Egypt with officers all over all of them.
[3374.68 --> 3381.40]  The Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, so that he pursued the Israelites who were marching out boldly.
[3382.62 --> 3387.44]  The Egyptians, all Pharaoh's horses and chariots, horsemen and troops,
[3387.44 --> 3395.20]  pursued the Israelites and overtook them as they camped by the sea near Harreoth opposite Baal-Zephon.
[3396.68 --> 3402.98]  As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up and there were the Egyptians marching after them.
[3404.18 --> 3408.68]  They were terrified and cried out to the Lord.
[3409.42 --> 3410.34]  They said to Moses,
[3410.34 --> 3414.98]  Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you brought us to the desert to die?
[3415.68 --> 3418.46]  What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt?
[3418.86 --> 3423.08]  Didn't we say to you in Egypt, leave us alone, let us serve the Egyptians?
[3423.08 --> 3428.28]  It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert.
[3430.20 --> 3432.08]  Moses answered the people,
[3433.08 --> 3434.04]  Do not be afraid.
[3434.86 --> 3438.12]  Stand firm and you will see the deliverance of the Lord.
[3438.42 --> 3440.34]  The deliverance the Lord will bring you today.
[3441.18 --> 3444.50]  The Egyptians you see today you will never see again.
[3444.66 --> 3446.52]  The Lord will fight for you.
[3446.52 --> 3449.06]  You need only be still.
[3449.06 --> 3453.02]  Then the Lord said to Moses,
[3453.02 --> 3456.06]  Why are you crying out to me?
[3456.54 --> 3458.12]  Tell the Israelites to move on.
[3458.46 --> 3465.70]  Raise your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea to divide the water so that the Israelites can go through the sea on dry ground.
[3465.70 --> 3471.06]  I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them.
[3471.14 --> 3475.92]  And I will gain glory through Pharaoh and all his army through his chariots and his horsemen.
[3476.14 --> 3483.70]  The Egyptians will know that I am the Lord and I will gain glory through Pharaoh, his chariots and his horsemen.
[3483.70 --> 3491.14]  Then the angel of the Lord, who had been traveling in front of Israel's army, withdrew and went behind them.
[3491.50 --> 3495.72]  The pillar of cloud also moved from in front and stood behind them.
[3496.54 --> 3499.36]  And coming between the armies of Egypt and of Israel.
[3500.78 --> 3504.96]  Throughout the night, the cloud brought darkness to the one side and light to the other.
[3505.42 --> 3507.94]  So neither went near the other all night long.
[3507.94 --> 3512.78]  Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea.
[3513.24 --> 3519.38]  And all that night, the Lord drove the sea back with a strong east wind and it turned to dry land.
[3520.00 --> 3527.10]  The waters were divided and the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground with a wall of water on their right and on their left.
[3528.52 --> 3534.96]  The Egyptians pursued them and all of Pharaoh's horses and chariots and horsemen followed them into the sea.
[3534.96 --> 3542.46]  During the last watch of the night, the Lord looked down from the pillar of fire and cloud at the Egyptian army and threw it into confusion.
[3543.64 --> 3546.48]  He jammed the wheels of their chariots so they had difficulty driving.
[3546.94 --> 3549.38]  And the Egyptians said, let's get away from the Israelites.
[3549.54 --> 3552.36]  The Lord is fighting against them.
[3554.26 --> 3562.40]  Then the Lord said to Moses, stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters may flow back over the Egyptians and their chariots and horsemen.
[3562.40 --> 3568.48]  Moses stretched out his hand over the sea and at daybreak, the sea went back to its place.
[3569.08 --> 3574.76]  The Egyptians were fleeing toward it and the Lord swept them into the sea.
[3576.60 --> 3579.40]  The water flowed back and covered the chariots and horsemen.
[3579.90 --> 3586.74]  The entire army of the Pharaoh that had followed the Israelites into the sea, not one of them survived.
[3586.74 --> 3593.74]  But the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground with a wall of water on their right and on their left.
[3593.90 --> 3598.26]  And that day the Lord saved Israel from the hands of the Egyptians.
[3598.86 --> 3602.10]  And Israel saw the Egyptians lying dead on the seashore.
[3603.10 --> 3607.08]  And when the Israelites saw the mighty hand of the Lord displayed against the Egyptians,
[3607.08 --> 3615.62]  the people feared the Lord and put their trust in him and in Moses, their servant.
[3616.36 --> 3617.64]  This is the word of the Lord.
[3622.14 --> 3627.54]  Now there's a lot here and so I want to jump right into this with you this morning.
[3627.54 --> 3644.66]  What you will see in this story for the Israelites and for us today is that who you are in God matters because of who he is in you.
[3646.54 --> 3653.16]  What you do is because what God has already done.
[3653.16 --> 3665.04]  If you are a Christian, your identity is determined, I'll even use the word, predestined before the foundation of the world.
[3665.72 --> 3675.44]  And so whatever you face in this present reality or in the future is already prepared for by God in you.
[3675.44 --> 3685.10]  And while that might be a challenge to wrap our minds around right now, that's what we're going to see in this text.
[3685.22 --> 3687.08]  And so let's see how we get there.
[3687.32 --> 3692.70]  And then I'll wrap that up with a couple ideas about what that changes for us today.
[3693.76 --> 3697.96]  Now, look with me at verse 19.
[3698.06 --> 3699.56]  We didn't read it, but just beforehand.
[3699.56 --> 3727.36]  The journey of the Exodus out of Egypt, out of captivity, is a completion of the promises that God made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[3728.02 --> 3728.16]  Right?
[3728.16 --> 3736.46]  God delivers Israel from Egypt not because they somehow deserve it, but because God is always faithful to his promises.
[3737.60 --> 3737.76]  Right?
[3737.88 --> 3739.48]  God's word stands.
[3740.24 --> 3743.92]  That's the point that Pastor Kevin made so powerfully last week.
[3743.92 --> 3749.74]  And that theme continues through and in and under this text.
[3749.74 --> 3756.68]  One of my favorite texts on this idea is actually from Deuteronomy 7.
[3757.46 --> 3760.26]  And if you've done pre-marriage counseling with me, this is familiar to you.
[3760.96 --> 3761.28]  Right?
[3761.34 --> 3764.52]  Where Moses remembers for the people, Deuteronomy 7,
[3764.52 --> 3767.66]  The Lord did not set his affection on you.
[3767.74 --> 3769.18]  That is, the Lord did not love you.
[3769.38 --> 3769.62]  Right?
[3769.66 --> 3772.70]  Or choose you because you were more numerous than other peoples.
[3772.82 --> 3774.14]  For you were the fewest of all peoples.
[3774.96 --> 3778.00]  But it was because the Lord loved you.
[3778.40 --> 3787.04]  And kept the oath, kept the promise that he swore to your ancestors that he brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the land of slavery.
[3787.04 --> 3790.32]  From the power of Pharaoh, king of Egypt.
[3791.24 --> 3791.38]  Right?
[3791.42 --> 3796.60]  God loves you because he loves you because he promised to love you.
[3796.72 --> 3799.92]  And he is faithful to his promises.
[3801.02 --> 3801.14]  Right?
[3801.14 --> 3804.86]  That's the foundation of God's love for his people.
[3805.62 --> 3806.78]  God's own promise.
[3806.90 --> 3808.02]  His own word.
[3808.02 --> 3811.66]  He can't but be faithful to his promises.
[3812.12 --> 3812.20]  Right?
[3812.32 --> 3813.66]  Joseph knew it.
[3814.24 --> 3816.14]  And Moses fulfilled it.
[3817.70 --> 3827.62]  Not only do we see God then as faithful to promises past, but that faithfulness is expressed in the present.
[3829.74 --> 3831.70]  Verse 21.
[3832.92 --> 3840.12]  By day the Lord went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud to guide them on their way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light.
[3840.54 --> 3846.86]  Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place in front of the people.
[3847.04 --> 3853.62]  A 60-foot column of fire is God guiding his people.
[3854.40 --> 3858.32]  The pillar of fire and of cloud show us that God is a guide.
[3858.66 --> 3858.76]  Right?
[3858.84 --> 3860.52]  He leads his people.
[3860.52 --> 3864.46]  And then jump to verse 19 of chapter 14.
[3864.46 --> 3872.78]  Then the angel of the Lord who had been traveling in front of them, presumably in or with that pillar of fire and cloud, withdrew and went behind them.
[3873.10 --> 3877.22]  The pillar of cloud moved from in front of them and stood behind them.
[3877.90 --> 3878.04]  Right?
[3878.04 --> 3881.26]  God is a guide and God is a guard.
[3883.26 --> 3883.78]  Right?
[3883.82 --> 3887.48]  He is a guide to lead you and a guard to protect you.
[3888.26 --> 3890.24]  And so remember, as we're looking at this, right?
[3890.50 --> 3895.08]  Who you are in him comes from who he is in you.
[3895.08 --> 3898.68]  And God is a guide and God is a guard.
[3899.04 --> 3902.44]  He leads you and so look to his leading.
[3903.60 --> 3903.68]  Right?
[3904.50 --> 3910.50]  Being a disciple of Jesus and of God means being a follower.
[3911.02 --> 3911.16]  Right?
[3911.22 --> 3913.58]  Doing what he does and what he commands.
[3913.80 --> 3915.04]  God is our guide.
[3915.52 --> 3918.30]  And God is a guard.
[3918.66 --> 3919.86]  He protects you.
[3919.86 --> 3924.86]  Now, clearly, that doesn't mean you're not going to face some stuff.
[3925.86 --> 3928.72]  But it does mean you don't face it alone.
[3929.84 --> 3932.64]  God made that point and reminded us before he prayed.
[3933.68 --> 3933.82]  Right?
[3933.84 --> 3935.76]  This is still a story of an army.
[3935.94 --> 3936.08]  Right?
[3936.14 --> 3938.50]  And in verse 20, it's two armies.
[3938.66 --> 3941.08]  The armies, plural, of Egypt and of Israel.
[3941.46 --> 3945.94]  The church is an army for the Lord and God is your guard.
[3945.94 --> 3951.68]  We wage war against powers and principalities, against spiritual forces, against sin and the flesh.
[3951.84 --> 3954.06]  But the battle is the Lord's.
[3956.24 --> 3959.74]  And so look, we're already starting to see it.
[3960.98 --> 3965.26]  Who you are in him isn't about what you do.
[3965.96 --> 3967.02]  At least not first and foremost.
[3967.02 --> 3973.46]  It's about what he has done and about who he is.
[3973.86 --> 3976.52]  God is a guide and a guard.
[3976.84 --> 3980.82]  Now, people make this mistake about Christianity all the time.
[3982.48 --> 3983.02]  Right?
[3983.06 --> 3987.06]  We make the mistake by saying that our religion is first about what you do.
[3988.52 --> 3991.52]  The gospel isn't about changing behaviors.
[3992.06 --> 3992.14]  Right?
[3992.14 --> 3996.04]  Christianity, the religion of the Bible, both in the Old Testament and the New Testament,
[3996.24 --> 3999.70]  is about what God has done and what God is going to do.
[4000.64 --> 4000.82]  Right?
[4000.86 --> 4005.60]  And what God has done works its way down through you to what you do.
[4005.66 --> 4006.08]  Absolutely.
[4006.44 --> 4009.00]  But not first because you've done it.
[4009.10 --> 4010.62]  Instead, because he has.
[4011.40 --> 4011.62]  Right?
[4011.66 --> 4013.78]  That order of operations matters.
[4013.78 --> 4018.88]  And if you make our religion about requiring certain moralities,
[4019.16 --> 4021.98]  you've made it about something other than God and Jesus.
[4023.44 --> 4027.52]  Make your religion about covenant relationship with God by the gospel,
[4027.94 --> 4032.00]  and then, in that order, you'll get transformed lives.
[4032.00 --> 4043.84]  Back in the story here, then, we read that God will harden Pharaoh's heart,
[4044.54 --> 4050.06]  and then we read that Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about them.
[4050.88 --> 4051.36]  Right?
[4051.42 --> 4054.70]  The end of which is that Pharaoh and his chariots come after the people.
[4055.42 --> 4061.98]  Now, I don't want to get too bogged down into the details or into theological debates,
[4062.54 --> 4067.48]  but to say that looking at the instances throughout this story
[4067.48 --> 4072.76]  and the plagues previous to this of Pharaoh's heart being hardened by God,
[4073.08 --> 4075.14]  or Pharaoh already having a hard heart,
[4075.26 --> 4078.66]  or Pharaoh hardening his own heart and changing his mind
[4078.66 --> 4081.54]  is a great follow-up study for you to do in your care groups
[4081.54 --> 4083.00]  or in your personal devotions.
[4083.00 --> 4086.14]  Now, I'm happy to follow up with you afterwards and talk about that.
[4086.56 --> 4089.70]  Let me just say, so that we can move past it,
[4089.70 --> 4093.74]  is that what God does, he does so that,
[4094.14 --> 4095.22]  verse 4,
[4095.36 --> 4099.46]  I will gain glory for myself through Pharaoh and his armies.
[4100.30 --> 4100.82]  Right?
[4100.86 --> 4101.66]  Or verse 18,
[4102.10 --> 4104.24]  the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord
[4104.24 --> 4107.92]  when I gain glory through Pharaoh and his armies.
[4108.08 --> 4111.44]  Everything God does is for his glory.
[4112.08 --> 4112.26]  Right?
[4112.26 --> 4113.22]  We saw it with the plagues.
[4113.78 --> 4113.92]  Right?
[4114.00 --> 4116.64]  Everything he did in the Egyptians
[4116.64 --> 4120.28]  was to show both the Egyptians and the Israelites
[4120.28 --> 4121.98]  and then through them down to us
[4121.98 --> 4125.04]  that he is Lord of all creation,
[4125.04 --> 4126.82]  that there is no God like him
[4126.82 --> 4130.48]  and that he is most worthy to be praised.
[4132.94 --> 4133.92]  Back to the story again.
[4135.56 --> 4136.84]  The turn of events,
[4137.46 --> 4140.10]  Pharaoh coming after the Israelites,
[4140.80 --> 4142.98]  proves to be too much for the people.
[4144.30 --> 4147.56]  Now, I'm not, I can't tell for sure, obviously,
[4147.72 --> 4150.36]  but maybe they thought that once they left Egypt
[4150.36 --> 4153.20]  it was going to be a simple walk in the park.
[4153.20 --> 4156.44]  I don't know, maybe it was going to be an easy walk to freedom,
[4156.58 --> 4158.46]  but it's pretty clear that the last thing
[4158.46 --> 4160.28]  that they had anticipated happening
[4160.28 --> 4163.18]  was that they would be pinned between the sea
[4163.18 --> 4165.86]  and the full forces of the Egyptian army.
[4166.58 --> 4168.32]  And we're told that they are terrified
[4168.32 --> 4170.46]  and that they cry out to the Lord.
[4171.08 --> 4174.00]  The people actually then begin to shift that anxiety,
[4174.18 --> 4175.34]  remember we've talked about this before,
[4175.42 --> 4177.50]  to Moses as the source of their trouble
[4177.50 --> 4181.78]  and long for the supposed comfort and security of Egypt.
[4181.78 --> 4184.42]  Now, again, there is a lesson hidden in here
[4184.42 --> 4185.68]  for those of us who are in leadership
[4185.68 --> 4187.34]  about how people project their fears
[4187.34 --> 4189.48]  in their midst of the lack of faith,
[4189.90 --> 4190.84]  but I'll give you that for free.
[4190.94 --> 4192.14]  You can ruminate that on your own.
[4193.66 --> 4196.08]  Even after all that they have seen God do,
[4196.90 --> 4198.52]  they are willfully ignorant,
[4199.10 --> 4201.02]  that is, they choose to be blind to
[4201.02 --> 4203.60]  his continued presence with them.
[4204.58 --> 4207.16]  In their minds, there are only two options,
[4207.70 --> 4209.90]  slavery in Egypt or death in the desert.
[4209.90 --> 4213.92]  I love the way that Peter Enns puts it.
[4213.98 --> 4215.68]  Peter Enns is a Bible scholar.
[4215.84 --> 4216.14]  He says,
[4216.96 --> 4218.12]  they, the people of Israel,
[4218.36 --> 4219.74]  have still not learned
[4219.74 --> 4221.10]  that their circumstances
[4221.10 --> 4223.00]  are not the final standard
[4223.00 --> 4225.24]  on which to view the work of God.
[4229.12 --> 4231.02]  Your present circumstances,
[4231.68 --> 4232.82]  whatever they may be,
[4233.30 --> 4235.14]  are not the final standard
[4235.14 --> 4237.02]  on which to view the work of God.
[4237.02 --> 4239.48]  But how often,
[4239.68 --> 4240.76]  and I'm guilty of this too,
[4240.86 --> 4242.44]  do we base our understanding
[4242.44 --> 4244.46]  of God's work in the world
[4244.46 --> 4246.56]  based on whatever it is
[4246.56 --> 4247.56]  you're facing right now?
[4248.14 --> 4249.00]  Right, how many times
[4249.00 --> 4250.10]  do you look at everything
[4250.10 --> 4251.64]  that's happening in your life
[4251.64 --> 4253.44]  or not happening in your life
[4253.44 --> 4254.30]  that you want to happen
[4254.30 --> 4255.68]  and assume that,
[4255.86 --> 4257.44]  one, either God has forgotten
[4257.44 --> 4259.18]  or God doesn't care
[4259.18 --> 4260.52]  or God is too busy
[4260.52 --> 4261.88]  with other people's problems,
[4261.98 --> 4263.64]  with bigger things going on,
[4263.64 --> 4264.30]  or four,
[4264.38 --> 4265.62]  that God isn't even real?
[4266.48 --> 4266.74]  And he's,
[4266.94 --> 4268.12]  of course he can't do anything about it
[4268.12 --> 4269.08]  because he's just not there.
[4270.38 --> 4271.80]  But the inner workings
[4271.80 --> 4273.02]  of your life
[4273.02 --> 4275.08]  are not the lens
[4275.08 --> 4276.74]  by which we should view
[4276.74 --> 4278.06]  the work of God.
[4278.14 --> 4278.50]  In fact,
[4278.60 --> 4279.46]  that order is just
[4279.46 --> 4280.16]  straight backwards.
[4281.62 --> 4282.10]  Right,
[4282.16 --> 4284.18]  you should let the work of God
[4284.18 --> 4285.00]  be the lens
[4285.00 --> 4286.16]  by which you look
[4286.16 --> 4287.34]  at the inner workings
[4287.34 --> 4288.36]  of your life.
[4289.82 --> 4290.30]  Right,
[4290.30 --> 4291.20]  when you get it backwards,
[4291.20 --> 4292.76]  you say things like,
[4293.46 --> 4294.10]  it would have been better
[4294.10 --> 4295.52]  for us to serve the Egyptians
[4295.52 --> 4297.26]  than to die in the desert.
[4298.62 --> 4299.66]  When you get it backwards,
[4299.90 --> 4300.84]  we say things like,
[4300.98 --> 4301.86]  yeah,
[4301.96 --> 4302.34]  you know what,
[4302.42 --> 4303.38]  that's too hard.
[4304.42 --> 4305.74]  As long as nobody gets hurt,
[4306.34 --> 4307.12]  I can just do it.
[4309.10 --> 4309.50]  Right,
[4309.54 --> 4310.18]  when we get it backwards,
[4310.32 --> 4311.16]  we say things like,
[4311.78 --> 4312.92]  it's just a little bit.
[4314.10 --> 4315.24]  It's only on the weekends.
[4316.06 --> 4317.04]  It's not a big deal.
[4318.54 --> 4318.90]  Right,
[4318.92 --> 4319.92]  when we get things backwards,
[4319.92 --> 4321.98]  there's a kind of compromise
[4321.98 --> 4323.76]  that is choosing
[4323.76 --> 4325.76]  a little death
[4325.76 --> 4326.90]  every time
[4326.90 --> 4329.32]  over the life
[4329.32 --> 4330.38]  that God wants for you.
[4332.28 --> 4333.22]  And then Moses
[4333.22 --> 4335.30]  gets in their face.
[4336.40 --> 4336.48]  Right,
[4336.56 --> 4337.06]  Moses says,
[4337.24 --> 4338.20]  do not be afraid,
[4338.58 --> 4339.32]  stand firm,
[4339.40 --> 4340.10]  and you will see
[4340.10 --> 4340.82]  the deliverance
[4340.82 --> 4341.74]  the Lord will bring
[4341.74 --> 4342.88]  you today.
[4343.26 --> 4344.54]  The Egyptians you see today,
[4344.62 --> 4345.66]  you will never see again.
[4345.90 --> 4347.32]  The Lord will fight for you.
[4347.32 --> 4349.38]  You need only to be still.
[4349.92 --> 4351.92]  Now,
[4352.64 --> 4356.22]  sometimes when we hear
[4356.22 --> 4356.82]  Moses say,
[4356.92 --> 4358.30]  you need only to be still,
[4359.04 --> 4360.52]  some of us go immediately
[4360.52 --> 4361.68]  to Psalm 46,
[4361.88 --> 4361.98]  right,
[4362.00 --> 4362.88]  be still and know
[4362.88 --> 4364.12]  that I am God.
[4364.46 --> 4365.54]  What Moses is saying here
[4365.54 --> 4366.38]  is actually
[4366.38 --> 4368.58]  a pretty terse command.
[4370.20 --> 4370.40]  Right,
[4370.50 --> 4371.94]  as we read it,
[4371.98 --> 4372.78]  it sounds like he might
[4372.78 --> 4373.48]  just be trying to like
[4373.48 --> 4374.42]  console them,
[4374.48 --> 4374.64]  right,
[4374.64 --> 4375.60]  like a good parent
[4375.60 --> 4376.48]  just trying to encourage
[4376.48 --> 4378.14]  their kid to do something,
[4378.26 --> 4378.40]  right,
[4378.40 --> 4378.62]  there,
[4378.70 --> 4378.86]  there,
[4378.94 --> 4379.44]  don't worry,
[4379.52 --> 4380.50]  God will take care of you.
[4380.78 --> 4381.28]  Just wait,
[4381.38 --> 4381.90]  just wait,
[4382.16 --> 4382.72]  you'll see.
[4383.20 --> 4384.00]  But instead,
[4384.56 --> 4384.70]  right,
[4384.78 --> 4386.00]  Moses is more accurately
[4386.00 --> 4386.44]  saying,
[4386.56 --> 4387.26]  shut up!
[4389.72 --> 4390.16]  Right,
[4390.20 --> 4390.92]  he isn't offering
[4390.92 --> 4391.98]  patient encouragement.
[4392.12 --> 4392.84]  He's frustrated
[4392.84 --> 4393.82]  with these people.
[4393.88 --> 4394.78]  What are you saying?
[4395.20 --> 4396.26]  Don't you understand?
[4396.38 --> 4397.40]  Haven't you seen a thing?
[4398.04 --> 4399.38]  Haven't you learned a thing?
[4399.50 --> 4400.46]  Stop whining.
[4400.90 --> 4401.80]  Don't be afraid.
[4402.24 --> 4403.06]  Trust God.
[4403.06 --> 4403.14]  God.
[4404.34 --> 4405.84]  You just don't get it.
[4406.78 --> 4408.04]  That's how Moses is feeling
[4408.04 --> 4408.68]  in this moment.
[4410.50 --> 4411.06]  And still,
[4411.86 --> 4414.56]  as a mark
[4414.56 --> 4417.26]  of God's deep compassion,
[4418.56 --> 4419.56]  as a mark of God's
[4419.56 --> 4420.52]  graciousness
[4420.52 --> 4421.80]  and his patience,
[4421.96 --> 4423.32]  his unyielding
[4423.32 --> 4424.34]  and prodigious love,
[4424.42 --> 4426.28]  he leads these people,
[4426.44 --> 4427.68]  these stubborn,
[4428.30 --> 4429.06]  ungrateful,
[4429.60 --> 4430.00]  grumbling,
[4430.56 --> 4431.52]  unimaginative,
[4431.72 --> 4433.18]  unfaithful people.
[4433.34 --> 4434.04]  He leads them
[4434.04 --> 4434.66]  to the edge
[4434.66 --> 4435.24]  of the water
[4435.24 --> 4436.18]  and Moses raises
[4436.18 --> 4436.88]  his staff
[4436.88 --> 4438.06]  and God pushes
[4438.06 --> 4439.02]  the water back
[4439.02 --> 4440.06]  with a strong wind
[4440.06 --> 4441.06]  and turns it
[4441.06 --> 4442.20]  to dry ground
[4442.20 --> 4442.94]  and we read
[4442.94 --> 4443.88]  the water's divided
[4443.88 --> 4444.58]  and the Israelites
[4444.58 --> 4445.76]  went through the sea
[4445.76 --> 4446.64]  on the dry ground
[4446.64 --> 4447.94]  with a wall of water
[4447.94 --> 4448.96]  on their right
[4448.96 --> 4450.42]  and on their left.
[4451.74 --> 4453.48]  Now imagine that scene.
[4454.64 --> 4455.38]  Now I get that
[4455.38 --> 4456.68]  there's all sorts of debates
[4456.68 --> 4457.54]  about the actual
[4457.54 --> 4458.82]  archaeological wear
[4458.82 --> 4459.80]  of this event
[4459.80 --> 4460.26]  and I'm happy
[4460.26 --> 4461.00]  to give you my thoughts
[4461.00 --> 4461.48]  and opinions
[4461.48 --> 4462.40]  on all of that afterwards
[4462.40 --> 4463.46]  but for now
[4463.46 --> 4464.44]  the story stands
[4464.44 --> 4465.36]  and you are meant
[4465.36 --> 4466.60]  to picture a wall
[4466.60 --> 4467.60]  of water.
[4468.70 --> 4469.64]  A few years ago
[4469.64 --> 4470.58]  I went to visit
[4470.58 --> 4472.86]  Niagara Falls.
[4473.00 --> 4473.78]  We live just outside
[4473.78 --> 4474.46]  of Niagara Falls
[4474.46 --> 4475.86]  but it was a number
[4475.86 --> 4476.48]  of years before
[4476.48 --> 4477.48]  we got on the ferry
[4477.48 --> 4478.44]  that takes you under
[4478.44 --> 4479.60]  to the base of the falls.
[4479.68 --> 4480.04]  Have any of you
[4480.04 --> 4480.70]  ever done this?
[4481.26 --> 4481.44]  Right?
[4481.60 --> 4482.64]  And you stand right
[4482.64 --> 4483.28]  or you stand
[4483.28 --> 4484.38]  on the deck of this boat
[4484.38 --> 4485.44]  and there's just
[4485.44 --> 4487.56]  167 feet
[4487.56 --> 4488.50]  or whatever it is
[4488.50 --> 4489.36]  of water
[4489.36 --> 4490.40]  crashing down
[4490.40 --> 4490.90]  around you.
[4491.12 --> 4492.62]  There's sheer power
[4492.62 --> 4494.10]  a wall of water
[4494.10 --> 4495.70]  and it is overwhelming.
[4496.18 --> 4496.78]  That's what you're
[4496.78 --> 4497.32]  meant to picture
[4497.32 --> 4498.58]  in this moment.
[4500.26 --> 4501.60]  Now as they walked
[4501.60 --> 4502.98]  undoubtedly
[4502.98 --> 4504.24]  some of them
[4504.24 --> 4505.76]  are terrified
[4505.76 --> 4507.26]  and timidly
[4507.26 --> 4508.38]  moving forward.
[4508.60 --> 4509.06]  Others of them
[4509.06 --> 4509.54]  are gathering
[4509.54 --> 4510.36]  in small groups
[4510.36 --> 4511.44]  and trying to stay
[4511.44 --> 4512.22]  into the center
[4512.22 --> 4512.86]  as far away
[4512.86 --> 4513.46]  from each wall
[4513.46 --> 4514.84]  as they possibly could
[4514.84 --> 4515.80]  and still others
[4515.80 --> 4517.20]  are scurrying around
[4517.20 --> 4518.44]  tracing their fingers
[4518.44 --> 4519.16]  like in the prince
[4519.16 --> 4519.60]  of Egypt
[4519.60 --> 4520.46]  through the edge
[4520.46 --> 4520.86]  of the water
[4520.86 --> 4521.64]  going whoa!
[4523.84 --> 4524.90]  Now what's amazing
[4524.90 --> 4525.92]  about this story
[4525.92 --> 4527.90]  is that no matter
[4527.90 --> 4528.68]  how they felt
[4528.68 --> 4529.48]  in that moment
[4529.48 --> 4530.56]  whether they were
[4530.56 --> 4531.02]  terrified
[4531.02 --> 4532.24]  or excited
[4532.24 --> 4532.86]  whether they were
[4532.86 --> 4533.24]  worried
[4533.24 --> 4534.30]  or overwhelmed
[4534.30 --> 4535.56]  or they were amazed
[4535.56 --> 4537.02]  they all made it
[4537.02 --> 4537.62]  through.
[4539.40 --> 4539.58]  Right?
[4539.66 --> 4540.72]  Someone put it
[4540.72 --> 4541.22]  like this
[4541.22 --> 4542.54]  said you know
[4542.54 --> 4543.28]  that some of them
[4543.28 --> 4543.86]  walked through
[4543.86 --> 4545.40]  like wow
[4545.40 --> 4548.26]  this is incredible
[4548.26 --> 4549.80]  and you know
[4549.80 --> 4550.42]  that some of them
[4550.42 --> 4550.82]  walked through
[4550.82 --> 4551.54]  like I'm gonna die
[4551.54 --> 4551.98]  I'm gonna die
[4551.98 --> 4552.38]  I'm gonna die
[4552.38 --> 4552.74]  I'm gonna die
[4552.74 --> 4553.16]  get me through
[4553.16 --> 4556.78]  but no matter
[4556.78 --> 4557.48]  how they were
[4557.48 --> 4558.64]  in that moment
[4558.64 --> 4561.68]  they all crossed over
[4561.68 --> 4564.06]  they were all saved
[4564.06 --> 4565.62]  why?
[4567.24 --> 4567.92]  Because it's not
[4567.92 --> 4568.52]  the quality
[4568.52 --> 4569.42]  of your faith
[4569.42 --> 4570.24]  that saves you
[4570.24 --> 4572.54]  it's the object
[4572.54 --> 4573.70]  of your faith
[4573.70 --> 4575.08]  that carries you
[4575.08 --> 4575.36]  through.
[4577.00 --> 4577.48]  Right?
[4577.54 --> 4578.38]  These callous
[4578.38 --> 4579.20]  people
[4579.20 --> 4580.50]  most of whom
[4580.50 --> 4581.50]  just moments before
[4581.50 --> 4582.22]  were saying
[4582.22 --> 4582.82]  that they preferred
[4582.82 --> 4583.54]  slavery
[4583.54 --> 4584.54]  and death
[4584.54 --> 4585.12]  in Egypt
[4585.12 --> 4586.44]  over trusting God
[4586.44 --> 4587.96]  are still saved
[4587.96 --> 4588.74]  by his grace.
[4590.34 --> 4591.06]  Everything
[4591.06 --> 4592.46]  about this story
[4592.46 --> 4593.50]  screams
[4593.50 --> 4594.18]  grace
[4594.18 --> 4595.20]  grace
[4595.20 --> 4596.08]  grace
[4596.08 --> 4597.24]  grace
[4597.24 --> 4599.04]  now I know
[4599.04 --> 4599.70]  that hearing
[4599.70 --> 4600.56]  that many of us
[4600.56 --> 4601.32]  are gonna be
[4601.32 --> 4601.70]  inclined
[4601.70 --> 4602.40]  to take this
[4602.40 --> 4602.70]  text
[4602.70 --> 4603.36]  and apply it
[4603.36 --> 4604.18]  to our lives
[4604.18 --> 4604.70]  by saying
[4604.70 --> 4605.28]  something like
[4605.28 --> 4607.36]  I just need
[4607.36 --> 4607.94]  to stand
[4607.94 --> 4608.56]  still
[4608.56 --> 4609.52]  and God
[4609.52 --> 4610.04]  will fight
[4610.04 --> 4610.54]  my battles
[4610.54 --> 4610.96]  for me
[4610.96 --> 4612.18]  I just have
[4612.18 --> 4612.92]  to let go
[4612.92 --> 4613.86]  and let God
[4613.86 --> 4614.50]  and everything
[4614.50 --> 4615.08]  will be okay
[4615.08 --> 4615.48]  I just have
[4615.48 --> 4616.06]  to increase
[4616.06 --> 4616.68]  my faith
[4616.68 --> 4617.40]  and things
[4617.40 --> 4617.86]  will be okay
[4617.86 --> 4618.24]  but that's
[4618.24 --> 4618.68]  not what
[4618.68 --> 4619.14]  this text
[4619.14 --> 4619.76]  is saying
[4619.76 --> 4621.26]  right?
[4621.34 --> 4621.82]  This text
[4621.82 --> 4622.48]  is saying
[4622.48 --> 4623.82]  stand still
[4623.82 --> 4624.46]  and see
[4624.46 --> 4625.04]  what God
[4625.04 --> 4626.18]  has already
[4626.18 --> 4627.08]  done for you
[4627.08 --> 4628.34]  God has already
[4628.34 --> 4629.14]  won the battle
[4629.14 --> 4629.68]  for you
[4629.68 --> 4630.16]  right?
[4630.18 --> 4630.58]  The things
[4630.58 --> 4631.30]  that we struggle
[4631.30 --> 4632.30]  with in this life
[4632.30 --> 4633.82]  pale in comparison
[4633.82 --> 4634.70]  to what God
[4634.70 --> 4635.62]  has already
[4635.62 --> 4636.40]  done
[4636.40 --> 4636.72]  right?
[4636.76 --> 4637.28]  If we are
[4637.28 --> 4637.68]  believers
[4637.68 --> 4638.74]  in Jesus Christ
[4638.74 --> 4639.40]  if the grace
[4639.40 --> 4639.90]  of God
[4639.90 --> 4640.44]  has worked
[4640.44 --> 4641.18]  in our hearts
[4641.18 --> 4641.88]  the battle
[4641.88 --> 4642.42]  of sin
[4642.42 --> 4642.92]  and death
[4642.92 --> 4643.68]  has already
[4643.68 --> 4644.28]  been won
[4644.28 --> 4645.12]  if you are
[4645.12 --> 4645.56]  a believer
[4645.56 --> 4645.94]  you have
[4645.94 --> 4646.70]  already
[4646.70 --> 4647.68]  crossed over
[4647.68 --> 4648.58]  says Jesus
[4648.58 --> 4649.44]  in John 5
[4649.44 --> 4650.12]  Jesus says
[4650.12 --> 4651.58]  I tell you
[4651.58 --> 4652.02]  the truth
[4652.02 --> 4653.32]  whoever hears
[4653.32 --> 4653.84]  my word
[4653.84 --> 4654.40]  and believes
[4654.40 --> 4655.16]  him who sent
[4655.16 --> 4656.00]  me has eternal
[4656.00 --> 4656.56]  life and will
[4656.56 --> 4657.30]  not be condemned
[4657.30 --> 4658.48]  he has
[4658.48 --> 4659.72]  crossed over
[4659.72 --> 4660.60]  from death
[4660.60 --> 4661.90]  to life
[4661.90 --> 4662.64]  you
[4662.64 --> 4663.80]  by grace
[4663.80 --> 4664.60]  through faith
[4664.60 --> 4665.60]  have already
[4665.60 --> 4666.58]  crossed
[4666.58 --> 4667.64]  over
[4667.64 --> 4672.30]  J. Alec
[4672.30 --> 4673.02]  Matier
[4673.02 --> 4674.24]  is an Old Testament
[4674.24 --> 4674.74]  scholar
[4674.74 --> 4676.18]  and he was once
[4676.18 --> 4676.82]  discussing the
[4676.82 --> 4677.52]  relationship between
[4677.52 --> 4678.18]  the Old Testament
[4678.18 --> 4679.56]  and the New Testament
[4679.56 --> 4680.68]  and he said this
[4680.68 --> 4681.68]  he said think about it
[4681.68 --> 4683.12]  think of what an
[4683.12 --> 4684.08]  Israelite would say
[4684.08 --> 4684.86]  on the way to
[4684.86 --> 4685.16]  Canaan
[4685.16 --> 4686.24]  having come out
[4686.24 --> 4686.84]  of the Red Sea
[4686.84 --> 4688.34]  if you asked him
[4688.34 --> 4689.28]  or her along the
[4689.28 --> 4690.42]  way who are you
[4690.42 --> 4692.08]  they would likely
[4692.08 --> 4692.54]  say
[4692.54 --> 4694.34]  I was a slave
[4694.34 --> 4695.90]  in a foreign land
[4695.90 --> 4696.96]  in bondage
[4696.96 --> 4697.74]  under the sentence
[4697.74 --> 4698.28]  of death
[4698.28 --> 4699.68]  I took shelter
[4699.68 --> 4700.46]  under the blood
[4700.46 --> 4701.08]  of the Lamb
[4701.08 --> 4701.94]  and our mediator
[4701.94 --> 4702.58]  led us out
[4702.58 --> 4703.38]  and we crossed
[4703.38 --> 4704.32]  over through
[4704.32 --> 4704.80]  the waters
[4704.80 --> 4705.90]  and we are on
[4705.90 --> 4706.62]  our way to the
[4706.62 --> 4707.32]  promised land
[4707.32 --> 4708.02]  but we're not
[4708.02 --> 4708.48]  there yet
[4708.48 --> 4709.74]  but he's given
[4709.74 --> 4710.32]  us his law
[4710.32 --> 4710.90]  to guide
[4710.90 --> 4712.14]  how we are
[4712.14 --> 4712.60]  to live
[4712.60 --> 4713.20]  in grace
[4713.20 --> 4713.98]  and he has
[4713.98 --> 4714.64]  come to dwell
[4714.64 --> 4715.16]  with us
[4715.16 --> 4715.50]  and he has
[4715.50 --> 4716.02]  made us
[4716.02 --> 4717.36]  into a community
[4717.36 --> 4718.42]  his presence
[4718.42 --> 4719.28]  is with us
[4719.28 --> 4719.70]  and he will
[4719.70 --> 4720.60]  stay with us
[4720.60 --> 4721.74]  until we
[4721.74 --> 4722.92]  get home
[4722.92 --> 4724.60]  Matier
[4724.60 --> 4725.18]  would go on
[4725.18 --> 4725.56]  to say
[4725.56 --> 4726.18]  that that is
[4726.18 --> 4726.98]  exactly
[4726.98 --> 4727.94]  almost word
[4727.94 --> 4728.42]  for word
[4728.42 --> 4730.06]  what a Christian
[4730.06 --> 4730.48]  says
[4730.48 --> 4732.20]  about who
[4732.20 --> 4732.72]  we are
[4732.72 --> 4734.56]  the movement
[4734.56 --> 4735.76]  of the exodus
[4735.76 --> 4736.64]  for Israel
[4736.64 --> 4737.32]  from a band
[4737.32 --> 4737.88]  of slaves
[4737.88 --> 4738.82]  to a nation
[4738.82 --> 4739.80]  of God's people
[4739.80 --> 4741.06]  towards the city
[4741.06 --> 4742.26]  in which God dwells
[4742.26 --> 4743.28]  is just as much
[4743.28 --> 4743.86]  the story
[4743.86 --> 4745.18]  of every Christian
[4745.18 --> 4746.86]  each and every Christian
[4746.86 --> 4747.58]  is someone
[4747.58 --> 4748.40]  who was once
[4748.40 --> 4748.94]  a slave
[4748.94 --> 4749.62]  to sin
[4749.62 --> 4750.64]  but now belongs
[4750.64 --> 4751.68]  to God's people
[4751.68 --> 4752.48]  the church
[4752.48 --> 4753.30]  and together
[4753.30 --> 4754.68]  we move through
[4754.68 --> 4755.32]  this world
[4755.32 --> 4756.88]  towards that great day
[4756.88 --> 4758.34]  when God's new Jerusalem
[4758.34 --> 4759.26]  his holy city
[4759.26 --> 4760.02]  will descend
[4760.02 --> 4760.92]  and join
[4760.92 --> 4761.92]  heaven and earth
[4761.92 --> 4762.86]  as one
[4762.86 --> 4764.68]  with the grace
[4764.68 --> 4765.42]  of God
[4765.42 --> 4766.48]  as the foundation
[4766.48 --> 4767.86]  for your identity
[4767.86 --> 4769.86]  changes everything
[4769.86 --> 4771.56]  about how you see
[4771.56 --> 4773.00]  your present circumstances
[4773.00 --> 4775.18]  and future realities
[4775.18 --> 4777.58]  and seeing history
[4777.58 --> 4778.92]  from this perspective
[4778.92 --> 4779.22]  right
[4779.22 --> 4780.54]  as climaxed
[4780.54 --> 4781.10]  in the life
[4781.10 --> 4781.72]  death
[4781.72 --> 4782.26]  and resurrection
[4782.26 --> 4782.98]  of Jesus
[4782.98 --> 4784.40]  in the ushering
[4784.40 --> 4785.30]  in of the kingdom
[4785.30 --> 4785.76]  of God
[4785.76 --> 4786.66]  in the true story
[4786.66 --> 4787.38]  of the whole world
[4787.38 --> 4788.36]  in which the ending
[4788.36 --> 4789.36]  is already written
[4789.36 --> 4790.56]  and already known
[4790.56 --> 4792.72]  but not yet fully realized
[4792.72 --> 4793.68]  that's the point
[4793.68 --> 4794.66]  of the exodus story
[4794.66 --> 4795.36]  that's the point
[4795.36 --> 4797.36]  of our continual retelling
[4797.36 --> 4798.42]  each week
[4798.42 --> 4799.60]  day in and day out
[4799.60 --> 4800.84]  of God's redemptive work
[4800.84 --> 4801.84]  in Jesus Christ
[4801.84 --> 4802.34]  right
[4802.34 --> 4803.72]  because the gospel
[4803.72 --> 4804.46]  is true
[4804.46 --> 4805.44]  I can face
[4805.44 --> 4806.32]  today
[4806.32 --> 4808.16]  because Jesus
[4808.16 --> 4809.18]  has lived the life
[4809.18 --> 4809.86]  that I was called
[4809.86 --> 4810.30]  to live
[4810.30 --> 4810.88]  and has paid
[4810.88 --> 4811.38]  the penalty
[4811.38 --> 4812.26]  for my sin
[4812.26 --> 4813.14]  in his death
[4813.14 --> 4814.38]  he makes me
[4814.38 --> 4816.10]  willing and ready
[4816.10 --> 4816.98]  from now on
[4816.98 --> 4817.76]  to live for him
[4817.76 --> 4818.62]  right
[4818.62 --> 4820.14]  because he has fully paid
[4820.14 --> 4821.04]  for all my sins
[4821.04 --> 4822.32]  with his precious blood
[4822.32 --> 4823.58]  and he has set me free
[4823.58 --> 4824.32]  from the tyranny
[4824.32 --> 4825.02]  of the devil
[4825.02 --> 4826.22]  I can be confident
[4826.22 --> 4827.80]  that he also watches
[4827.80 --> 4828.42]  over me
[4828.42 --> 4829.16]  in such a way
[4829.16 --> 4829.78]  that not a hair
[4829.78 --> 4830.84]  can fall from my head
[4830.84 --> 4831.82]  without the will
[4831.82 --> 4832.62]  of my father
[4832.62 --> 4833.60]  in heaven
[4833.60 --> 4834.88]  you see
[4834.88 --> 4837.32]  the Israelites
[4837.32 --> 4838.00]  grumbled
[4838.00 --> 4839.70]  and feared
[4839.70 --> 4841.06]  for their lives
[4841.06 --> 4842.36]  because they had
[4842.36 --> 4843.44]  not yet learned
[4843.44 --> 4844.70]  that their own
[4844.70 --> 4845.20]  struggles
[4845.20 --> 4845.82]  and trials
[4845.82 --> 4846.36]  and hardships
[4846.36 --> 4847.74]  are not the standard
[4847.74 --> 4848.78]  by which we view
[4848.78 --> 4849.50]  the work of God
[4849.50 --> 4851.96]  we view the work
[4851.96 --> 4852.42]  of God
[4852.42 --> 4853.38]  by the struggles
[4853.38 --> 4854.42]  and trials
[4854.42 --> 4855.40]  and hardship
[4855.40 --> 4857.12]  that he endured
[4857.12 --> 4858.52]  on the cross
[4858.52 --> 4859.32]  for us
[4859.32 --> 4861.22]  we view the work
[4861.22 --> 4861.54]  of God
[4861.54 --> 4862.80]  by what he endured
[4862.80 --> 4863.52]  for the sake
[4863.52 --> 4864.30]  of his people
[4864.30 --> 4865.18]  the church
[4865.18 --> 4866.10]  the true Israel
[4866.10 --> 4867.56]  and the new Israel
[4867.56 --> 4869.72]  so let me say that again
[4869.72 --> 4870.82]  so you don't
[4870.82 --> 4871.36]  miss it
[4871.36 --> 4873.68]  your own struggles
[4873.68 --> 4874.62]  and trials
[4874.62 --> 4875.30]  and hardships
[4875.30 --> 4877.04]  are not the standard
[4877.04 --> 4877.98]  by which we view
[4877.98 --> 4878.80]  the work of God
[4878.80 --> 4880.84]  we view the work
[4880.84 --> 4881.32]  of God
[4881.32 --> 4882.44]  by the struggles
[4882.44 --> 4883.34]  and trials
[4883.34 --> 4884.04]  and hardships
[4884.04 --> 4885.72]  he endured
[4885.72 --> 4886.94]  on the cross
[4886.94 --> 4888.94]  that's
[4888.94 --> 4890.02]  the gospel
[4890.02 --> 4890.94]  truth
[4890.94 --> 4891.80]  and that's the point
[4891.80 --> 4892.62]  of Exodus
[4892.62 --> 4893.76]  14
[4893.76 --> 4895.04]  right
[4895.04 --> 4895.56]  the idea
[4895.56 --> 4896.42]  is not so much
[4896.42 --> 4897.32]  that we apply
[4897.32 --> 4897.86]  the Exodus
[4897.86 --> 4899.08]  to our lives
[4899.08 --> 4900.22]  but that the Exodus
[4900.22 --> 4901.06]  already applies
[4901.06 --> 4901.62]  to us
[4901.62 --> 4903.12]  and the significance
[4903.12 --> 4903.88]  of this text
[4903.88 --> 4904.36]  and story
[4904.36 --> 4905.18]  isn't found
[4905.18 --> 4906.02]  in what we do
[4906.02 --> 4906.62]  with it
[4906.62 --> 4908.68]  but what this story
[4908.68 --> 4909.20]  right
[4909.20 --> 4909.72]  the release
[4909.72 --> 4910.36]  from slavery
[4910.36 --> 4910.86]  and bondage
[4910.86 --> 4911.28]  to sin
[4911.28 --> 4912.10]  tells us
[4912.10 --> 4912.60]  that God
[4912.60 --> 4913.44]  has already
[4913.44 --> 4913.88]  done
[4913.88 --> 4915.42]  stories
[4915.42 --> 4915.94]  not about
[4915.94 --> 4916.68]  moralisms
[4916.68 --> 4917.16]  that we can
[4917.16 --> 4917.80]  apply to our
[4917.80 --> 4918.36]  daily struggles
[4918.36 --> 4918.60]  right
[4918.60 --> 4919.26]  to let go
[4919.26 --> 4920.16]  and let God
[4920.16 --> 4920.92]  to be still
[4920.92 --> 4921.54]  and Godful
[4921.54 --> 4921.98]  fight for you
[4921.98 --> 4922.94]  even if those
[4922.94 --> 4923.62]  things are true
[4923.62 --> 4924.04]  or good
[4924.04 --> 4924.72]  or even if those
[4924.72 --> 4925.20]  things are worth
[4925.20 --> 4925.86]  learning
[4925.86 --> 4926.64]  the main point
[4926.64 --> 4927.34]  of this story
[4927.34 --> 4928.42]  is not to give you
[4928.42 --> 4929.26]  a pep talk
[4929.26 --> 4930.60]  for trying times
[4930.60 --> 4931.22]  and hardships
[4931.22 --> 4932.54]  it's a reminder
[4932.54 --> 4933.58]  that God
[4933.58 --> 4934.50]  has already won
[4934.50 --> 4935.36]  and sometimes
[4935.36 --> 4936.42]  you just need
[4936.42 --> 4937.32]  to shut up
[4937.32 --> 4939.50]  and praise him
[4939.50 --> 4941.12]  in that moment
[4941.12 --> 4944.66]  you don't have
[4944.66 --> 4945.46]  to fear death
[4945.46 --> 4946.70]  because death
[4946.70 --> 4947.20]  has already
[4947.20 --> 4947.80]  been defeated
[4947.80 --> 4949.82]  you don't need
[4949.82 --> 4950.52]  to fear public
[4950.52 --> 4950.94]  opinion
[4950.94 --> 4951.84]  because God
[4951.84 --> 4952.56]  loves you
[4952.56 --> 4953.56]  and has chosen you
[4953.56 --> 4954.04]  from before the
[4954.04 --> 4954.86]  foundation of the world
[4954.86 --> 4955.84]  and that's enough
[4955.84 --> 4956.44]  for you
[4956.44 --> 4958.82]  you don't have
[4958.82 --> 4959.46]  to worry about
[4959.46 --> 4959.98]  this day
[4959.98 --> 4960.80]  or what it will
[4960.80 --> 4961.10]  bring
[4961.10 --> 4961.78]  because God
[4961.78 --> 4962.60]  has already
[4962.60 --> 4963.16]  given you
[4963.16 --> 4963.90]  every spiritual
[4963.90 --> 4964.30]  blessing
[4964.30 --> 4965.64]  in the heavenly realms
[4965.64 --> 4967.14]  right
[4967.14 --> 4967.48]  you don't need
[4967.48 --> 4968.16]  to be overwhelmed
[4968.16 --> 4969.02]  by the future
[4969.02 --> 4969.96]  because before
[4969.96 --> 4970.54]  the foundation
[4970.54 --> 4971.08]  of the world
[4971.08 --> 4972.00]  God has plans
[4972.00 --> 4972.50]  for you
[4972.50 --> 4973.62]  to guide you
[4973.62 --> 4974.66]  and to guard you
[4974.66 --> 4975.24]  to give you
[4975.24 --> 4975.86]  a hope
[4975.86 --> 4977.24]  and a purpose
[4977.24 --> 4979.64]  God is
[4979.64 --> 4981.44]  our guide
[4981.44 --> 4983.30]  God is
[4983.30 --> 4984.56]  our guard
[4984.56 --> 4985.34]  the gospel
[4985.34 --> 4986.74]  is your identity
[4986.74 --> 4987.78]  and grab hold
[4987.78 --> 4988.76]  of this by faith
[4988.76 --> 4990.08]  fear the Lord
[4990.08 --> 4991.84]  and put your
[4991.84 --> 4992.60]  trust
[4992.60 --> 4994.66]  in him
[4994.66 --> 4996.78]  there is no
[4996.78 --> 4997.64]  other way
[4997.64 --> 4999.04]  through this
[4999.04 --> 4999.98]  life
[4999.98 --> 5001.02]  but to fear
[5001.02 --> 5001.56]  the Lord
[5001.56 --> 5002.72]  and trust
[5002.72 --> 5004.32]  in him
[5004.32 --> 5005.30]  let me pray
[5005.30 --> 5006.14]  for you
[5006.14 --> 5009.80]  Lord our God
[5009.80 --> 5010.24]  amen
[5010.24 --> 5011.02]  and amen
[5011.02 --> 5012.12]  to your gospel
[5012.12 --> 5012.86]  truth
[5012.86 --> 5013.18]  amen
[5013.18 --> 5013.90]  and amen
[5013.90 --> 5014.72]  to the gospel
[5014.72 --> 5015.16]  ringing
[5015.16 --> 5016.02]  clearly
[5016.02 --> 5017.10]  in our hearts
[5017.10 --> 5017.70]  and lives
[5017.70 --> 5018.34]  in our minds
[5018.34 --> 5019.20]  and imaginations

[5025.78 --> 5026.48]  affections
[5026.48 --> 5027.42]  by the life
[5027.42 --> 5028.26]  you have lived
[5028.26 --> 5028.70]  and the death
[5028.70 --> 5029.48]  you desired
[5029.48 --> 5030.82]  the death
[5030.82 --> 5031.52]  you died
[5031.52 --> 5032.42]  in our place
[5032.42 --> 5033.36]  captivate us
[5033.36 --> 5033.58]  now
[5033.58 --> 5033.96]  by your
[5033.96 --> 5034.92]  exaltation
[5034.92 --> 5035.48]  to the right
[5035.48 --> 5035.84]  hand
[5035.84 --> 5036.52]  of God

[5040.00 --> 5043.28]  so that we
[5043.28 --> 5043.80]  can turn
[5043.80 --> 5044.24]  from
[5044.24 --> 5045.48]  being captive
[5045.48 --> 5046.80]  to sin
[5046.80 --> 5049.22]  and by
[5049.22 --> 5049.72]  covenant
[5049.72 --> 5051.14]  relationship
[5051.14 --> 5051.78]  to you
[5051.78 --> 5052.92]  that we
[5052.92 --> 5053.38]  might be
[5053.38 --> 5053.88]  captive
[5053.88 --> 5055.00]  to
[5055.00 --> 5055.98]  your
[5055.98 --> 5057.16]  glory
[5057.16 --> 5058.88]  transform
[5058.88 --> 5059.64]  us now
[5059.64 --> 5060.34]  to fear
[5060.34 --> 5061.00]  you
[5061.00 --> 5061.42]  and to

[5061.88 --> 5062.56]  in you
[5062.56 --> 5063.58]  alone
[5063.58 --> 5065.34]  you

[5071.86 --> 5073.30]  amen
[5098.66 --> 5101.10]  how great
[5101.10 --> 5102.46]  the chasm
[5102.46 --> 5104.02]  that lay
[5104.02 --> 5104.66]  between
[5104.66 --> 5105.96]  us
[5105.96 --> 5107.04]  how high
[5107.04 --> 5108.20]  the mountain
[5108.20 --> 5109.88]  I could
[5109.88 --> 5111.60]  not climb
[5111.60 --> 5113.90]  in desperation
[5113.90 --> 5115.62]  I turned
[5115.62 --> 5116.92]  to heaven
[5116.92 --> 5118.50]  and spoke
[5118.50 --> 5119.96]  your name
[5119.96 --> 5120.64]  into
[5120.64 --> 5123.42]  the night

[5128.48 --> 5128.96]  kindness
[5128.96 --> 5129.98]  tore through
[5129.98 --> 5131.46]  the shadows
[5131.46 --> 5133.22]  of my
[5133.22 --> 5134.38]  soul
[5134.38 --> 5135.82]  the work
[5135.82 --> 5137.54]  is finished

[5145.76 --> 5150.14]  what could
[5150.14 --> 5151.32]  imagine
[5151.32 --> 5153.06]  so great
[5153.06 --> 5154.28]  a mercy
[5154.28 --> 5155.82]  what heart

[5161.80 --> 5163.10]  of ages
[5163.10 --> 5164.68]  stepped down
[5164.68 --> 5166.16]  from glory
[5166.16 --> 5167.68]  to wear
[5167.68 --> 5168.84]  my sin
[5168.84 --> 5170.58]  and bear
[5170.58 --> 5172.40]  my shame
[5172.40 --> 5173.72]  the cross
[5173.72 --> 5174.86]  has spoken
[5174.86 --> 5176.66]  I am
[5176.66 --> 5177.82]  forgiven
[5177.82 --> 5179.68]  the King
