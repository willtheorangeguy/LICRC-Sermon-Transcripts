[1445.52 --> 1463.10]  Lord, we take hope, knowing that you are compassionate and gracious, slow to anger,金
[1463.10 --> 1478.12]  compassionate and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in love, that you will not always accuse, nor will you harbor your anger.
[1479.26 --> 1484.52]  You do not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities.
[1485.74 --> 1492.54]  For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is your love for those who fear you.
[1493.34 --> 1500.10]  As far as the east is from the west, so far you have removed our sins from us.
[1501.44 --> 1516.98]  Lord, as we celebrate and remember around the Lord's Supper table today, the sacrifice you made for us on the cross, may we be forever humbled by your love, your mercy and your grace.
[1518.62 --> 1522.50]  May we forever be grateful. In your name we pray, Jesus.

[2280.02 --> 2281.22]  If you want, if not, I'll just pray.
[2281.22 --> 2283.04]  But everybody can come forward if they want to.
[2283.72 --> 2285.74]  And we will do the kids' blessing.
[2291.70 --> 2292.72]  Well, hello, Ruby.
[2298.10 --> 2299.84]  And everybody else.
[2300.22 --> 2301.26]  Good morning, kids.
[2301.72 --> 2302.74]  How's everybody doing today?
[2303.64 --> 2304.36]  We're good.
[2304.48 --> 2305.96]  Are we ready for some Children's Worship Time?
[2306.58 --> 2308.82]  Are we ready to hear Pastor Chris if we're staying in the church?
[2309.82 --> 2310.02]  Yeah.
[2310.46 --> 2310.82]  Woo!
[2312.02 --> 2312.50]  All right.
[2312.68 --> 2313.26]  Let's pray.
[2313.64 --> 2314.50]  And then we'll head off to Children's Worship.
[2314.50 --> 2315.84]  We'll do the Children's Blessing.
[2315.92 --> 2317.64]  And then we'll head off to Children's Worship Time, okay?
[2317.94 --> 2318.60]  Will you pray with me?
[2319.44 --> 2320.94]  Dear God, thank you so much for this day.
[2321.02 --> 2323.70]  Thank you that we can be here in your church today.
[2323.86 --> 2326.00]  And that we can learn more about you.
[2326.08 --> 2328.80]  And whether we go to Children's Worship Time or we stay back in the church here,
[2328.80 --> 2332.68]  we just pray that you'll open up our ears to hear your word to us today.
[2332.82 --> 2333.78]  We pray this in your name.
[2334.18 --> 2334.58]  Amen.
[2335.62 --> 2335.88]  All right.
[2335.94 --> 2336.60]  Let's just stand up.
[2337.00 --> 2338.56]  And everybody else, please stand up.
[2338.84 --> 2341.50]  All right.
[2341.84 --> 2342.58]  All right.
[2351.16 --> 2351.80]  All right.
[2353.84 --> 2354.06]  All right.
[2354.42 --> 2355.24]  All right.
[2355.24 --> 2355.32]  All right.
[2355.98 --> 2356.42]  All right.
[2356.42 --> 2386.40]  Thank you.
[2386.42 --> 2416.40]  Thank you.
[2416.44 --> 2426.16]  We're also going to pray a prayer of celebration for Judy, who's celebrating her 65th birthday on Tuesday.
[2426.80 --> 2429.32]  And Judy is here this morning. Amen. Amen.
[2429.32 --> 2437.80]  And so you can find Judy after the service and congratulate her.
[2437.80 --> 2442.36]  Don't overwhelm her, but whelm her appropriately.
[2442.36 --> 2447.60]  And we'll pray for a couple other things along the way.
[2447.68 --> 2449.92]  Will you join me in prayer together?
[2449.92 --> 2461.56]  Holy God and Heavenly Father,
[2461.56 --> 2468.50]  We gather in your presence this morning as a church family to sing your praises.
[2469.18 --> 2476.06]  To proclaim the truth of who you are and what you have done and are doing and will do in the world.
[2476.06 --> 2482.82]  We thank you, Lord God, for your promise and your covenant to us.
[2482.96 --> 2489.20]  And we thank you for the ways that we have seen your faithfulness in our own lives and stories.
[2489.20 --> 2499.46]  God, as we worship you this morning, we pray that you would open the eyes of our hearts to see you more clearly today.
[2499.46 --> 2513.66]  To love you more dearly and deeply in the depths of our being and that we can together go from this place in faith and trust into the various places that you call us.
[2513.74 --> 2521.06]  Into the struggles and the challenges of life lived in you and on mission with you to the world.
[2521.06 --> 2528.34]  And so God, soften our hearts for the hurting and the broken.
[2530.98 --> 2534.22]  Strengthen our hands for the work that you call us to.
[2535.58 --> 2541.52]  And send us out with a deep conviction, the truth, the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[2542.80 --> 2549.74]  God, as we look around the world, we know that there are so many places that are crying out for your peace and your presence.
[2551.06 --> 2561.98]  Globally, God, there are really important and big conversations or lack of conversations that are affecting the geopolitical situation around the world.
[2562.94 --> 2572.58]  We think in particular after this past week with the United States officials visiting Taiwan and then China issuing threats in response to that.
[2572.58 --> 2583.60]  We pray, Lord God, that even as China gives a show of force and mobilizes, that you would let cooler heads prevail and that there would be peace.
[2585.00 --> 2590.20]  God, we pray too for the ongoing situation and war in Ukraine.
[2591.04 --> 2593.60]  We pray too that there would be peace there.
[2593.60 --> 2596.78]  Let justice prevail.
[2597.12 --> 2607.02]  And we pray that the leadership in Russia, in particular, President Putin, that you would soften hearts and bring peace.
[2608.16 --> 2617.88]  God, to that end as well, we pray for the commitment that Canada has made to send troops to England in order to train Ukrainian soldiers.
[2617.88 --> 2618.14]  We pray for the people that they would pray for their soldiers.
[2618.14 --> 2618.28]  We pray for the people that they would come to their soldiers.
[2618.28 --> 2623.32]  We pray for the men and women who will go on behalf of our country.
[2623.72 --> 2634.14]  We pray that you would keep them safe and that you would, Lord God, use them to usher in peace between Ukraine and Canada.
[2635.78 --> 2646.34]  Lord God, we know that even as we come closer to home, there are things that are happening that are giving us anxiety
[2646.34 --> 2648.80]  and causing us fear.
[2650.16 --> 2655.62]  And so we pray, Lord God, for those situations that make us cry out in wonder.
[2656.46 --> 2662.08]  We pray, God, for those who are asking hard questions of life and faith,
[2662.22 --> 2664.92]  for those who are struggling in the midst of doubt,
[2665.04 --> 2670.08]  who are maybe deconstructing or differentiating their experience of faith.
[2671.24 --> 2674.74]  We pray, Lord God, for our sons and daughters, our brothers and sisters,
[2674.74 --> 2678.82]  our friends and neighbors who have wandered away from faith.
[2680.06 --> 2684.98]  We pray, Lord God, that you would reveal yourself to them in a compelling and powerful way
[2684.98 --> 2688.18]  that would draw their heart's affection back to you.
[2689.12 --> 2693.80]  We rest on the covenant promises made to these individuals and children,
[2693.96 --> 2696.90]  maybe in baptism, maybe spoken over them in word.
[2697.28 --> 2702.48]  And we pray, Lord God, that you would make that real again for them.
[2702.48 --> 2710.02]  We pray that you would bring the right people into their lives to speak the truth of the gospel,
[2710.14 --> 2717.80]  the truth of Jesus, that you would reveal yourself in power and that their hard hearts would be softened.
[2717.80 --> 2725.94]  Lord our God, we pray for those who are experiencing illness or sickness,
[2726.16 --> 2730.84]  who are experiencing some sort of physical ailment of any kind.
[2730.96 --> 2736.96]  We pray that you would bring healing and wholeness, that you would bring restoration to them.
[2736.96 --> 2748.22]  Whatever it is that is causing sickness, Lord God, we pray that you would bring an end to that trial and to that struggle.
[2749.38 --> 2752.92]  And God, for those who are dealing with the long-term effects of sickness,
[2753.12 --> 2758.16]  whether it's long-term effects of COVID or some other health concerns,
[2758.16 --> 2762.10]  we pray, Lord God, that you would also bring an end to that struggle,
[2762.58 --> 2768.08]  bring healing and bring a sense of rest and a return of strength and energy.
[2768.64 --> 2775.90]  We pray that you would bring an answer to the crying out of our hearts to that end.
[2775.90 --> 2786.02]  God, we know that not only are there those who are dealing with long-term health effects,
[2786.22 --> 2791.28]  there are those who are doing so in particular living situations.
[2791.28 --> 2799.08]  We want to pray for those who are living in assisted living and for the staff that help them.
[2799.94 --> 2805.62]  We hear stories from so many about staff shortages in these places.
[2805.90 --> 2813.64]  And we pray that you would help bring an end to that, provide people to work appropriately in so many different places,
[2813.64 --> 2817.00]  not just in healthcare industries which are experiencing shortages,
[2817.30 --> 2822.42]  but across our economic world we hear of these shortages.
[2822.64 --> 2827.32]  And we pray, Lord God, help us and bring the right people.
[2827.70 --> 2832.10]  For those who are working, God, we pray that they would be messengers of peace,
[2832.10 --> 2838.54]  that they would give hope to those whom they serve in those places, homes.
[2840.10 --> 2847.04]  Father God, we give you thanks for the testimony from Pastor Kevin and the group that went to Inspire.
[2847.04 --> 2851.00]  We pray that you would continue to reveal yourself to them,
[2851.10 --> 2856.70]  continue to challenge our thinking and our normal way of operating in the world
[2856.70 --> 2860.08]  so that we might more faithfully be present with you,
[2860.14 --> 2865.04]  that we might more faithfully submit to you and follow after you in service.
[2865.54 --> 2870.62]  Continue to inspire that group and through them to inspire us,
[2871.22 --> 2878.04]  especially as we prepare a discussion and an evening together to discuss young adult ministries.
[2878.90 --> 2881.68]  Thank you for the testimonies of our young adults
[2881.68 --> 2885.08]  and for the way that you are working in and through them.
[2885.32 --> 2889.56]  We thank you for the blessing that we have from them.
[2890.34 --> 2895.54]  And we pray, Lord God, that we would continue to hear and experience that in our midst.
[2897.24 --> 2900.44]  One of those young adults we want to pray for is Jared, Lord God,
[2900.50 --> 2903.42]  as he prepares to head to Costa Rica again.
[2904.06 --> 2908.94]  We thank you for the opportunity that he has to do another semester with Cape and Ray there.
[2908.94 --> 2913.16]  We pray that you would use him powerfully and mightily
[2913.16 --> 2919.12]  and that you would use this time to draw his heart ever closer to you.
[2919.54 --> 2923.34]  And that as he discerns what it means to live as a disciple of Jesus
[2923.34 --> 2926.30]  who daily takes up his cross to follow after you,
[2926.68 --> 2928.14]  wherever that may take him,
[2928.52 --> 2932.78]  we pray that you would encourage his heart and give him what he needs.
[2932.78 --> 2939.60]  God, we celebrate as well with Judy 65 years of her life.
[2939.76 --> 2945.38]  We thank you for who she is and the joy that she brings to whoever she talks to
[2945.38 --> 2950.38]  and the opportunities that we have had to spend time with her and to get to know her.
[2950.54 --> 2953.14]  We thank you that she is here with us this morning.
[2953.48 --> 2956.62]  We pray that you would bless her with many, many more years
[2956.62 --> 2961.02]  that she might continue to be a blessing to so many of us.
[2961.02 --> 2968.14]  God, even as we celebrate 65 years, we are mindful again of new life
[2968.14 --> 2974.16]  and we give you thanks with the Klingeltanks for Theo and for his young life.
[2974.32 --> 2982.26]  We thank you for the growth and the development that he has had in his two weeks.
[2982.50 --> 2985.18]  And we pray now that you would bless him
[2985.18 --> 2991.04]  and that you would be with the family as they envelop him into their life.
[2991.38 --> 2996.76]  We thank you for the chance that we as a church have to support them through meal train and things like that.
[2996.82 --> 2998.86]  And for those who have signed up, we give you praise
[2998.86 --> 3003.14]  and are grateful that we can meet these needs in that way.
[3003.14 --> 3009.34]  Lord our God, as we practice community together,
[3009.34 --> 3012.40]  as we come to your table in this service,
[3012.40 --> 3015.86]  we pray that there we would receive your grace.
[3016.68 --> 3021.10]  And that there, Lord God, we would have the grace that is offered to us
[3021.10 --> 3025.90]  in the preaching of your word affirmed and confirmed in the depths of our hearts.
[3025.90 --> 3031.98]  And so already now, begin working in us as your word is heard and proclaimed.
[3032.24 --> 3036.88]  Begin working in us a love for Jesus brought about by the gospel
[3036.88 --> 3039.76]  that we might hear your word this morning,
[3040.30 --> 3044.76]  that it might go deep into the depths of our heart and mind
[3044.76 --> 3049.22]  and that we might be transformed into the image of Jesus Christ.
[3049.92 --> 3053.64]  We pray this, Lord God, in your most holy name.
[3054.70 --> 3055.00]  Amen.
[3055.90 --> 3069.46]  Indeed, we are going to jump into God's word for some time together.
[3070.18 --> 3072.50]  If you're visiting with us this summer,
[3072.66 --> 3076.80]  we're doing a series in the parables of Jesus,
[3077.92 --> 3081.46]  looking at different parables and stories that Jesus told
[3081.46 --> 3085.58]  and then reflecting on what they mean for our life lived today.
[3085.58 --> 3087.44]  Some 2,000 years later.
[3088.08 --> 3091.72]  This morning, we're going to read the parable of the lost son
[3091.72 --> 3093.24]  or the parable of the prodigal son,
[3093.34 --> 3097.54]  depending on what translation of the Bible you are reading from.
[3098.10 --> 3102.38]  And that is found in Luke 15, starting at verse 11,
[3103.28 --> 3105.30]  and then we'll read through the end of the chapter.
[3106.18 --> 3108.98]  If you have a Bible with you, I encourage you to open that up.
[3108.98 --> 3110.22]  I'll have it there.
[3110.30 --> 3113.52]  Otherwise, it will be on the screen over my shoulder.
[3115.04 --> 3116.78]  Hear then the word of God.
[3120.36 --> 3121.58]  Jesus continued.
[3121.58 --> 3126.38]  There was a man who had two sons.
[3126.38 --> 3129.18]  The younger one said to his father,
[3129.72 --> 3132.44]  Father, give me my share of the estate.
[3133.54 --> 3135.88]  So he divided his property between them.
[3137.58 --> 3138.82]  And not long after that,
[3138.92 --> 3141.02]  the younger son got together all he had
[3141.02 --> 3142.80]  and set off for a distant country
[3142.80 --> 3145.88]  and there squandered his wealth and wild living.
[3146.88 --> 3148.32]  After he had spent everything,
[3148.58 --> 3150.90]  there was a severe famine in that whole country,
[3150.90 --> 3152.66]  and he began to be in need.
[3153.60 --> 3156.62]  So he went and hired himself out
[3156.62 --> 3158.12]  to a citizen of that country
[3158.12 --> 3161.22]  who sent him to his fields to feed pigs.
[3162.50 --> 3165.48]  He longed to fill his stomach with the pods
[3165.48 --> 3166.52]  that the pigs were eating,
[3167.42 --> 3169.20]  but no one gave him anything.
[3170.72 --> 3172.82]  When he came to his senses, he said,
[3173.56 --> 3176.94]  how many of my father's hired servants have food to spare
[3176.94 --> 3179.60]  and here I am starving to death?
[3180.90 --> 3184.58]  I will set out and go back to my father
[3184.58 --> 3185.46]  and say to him,
[3185.94 --> 3188.42]  Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.
[3188.74 --> 3191.02]  I am no longer worthy to be called your son.
[3191.40 --> 3193.42]  Make me like one of your hired servants.
[3194.18 --> 3196.54]  So he got up and went to his father.
[3198.04 --> 3200.42]  But while he was still a long way off,
[3200.50 --> 3202.14]  his father saw him
[3202.14 --> 3204.40]  and was filled with compassion for him.
[3204.68 --> 3205.76]  He ran to his son,
[3205.92 --> 3208.30]  threw his arms around him and kissed him.
[3209.40 --> 3210.46]  The son said,
[3210.46 --> 3212.88]  Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.
[3213.14 --> 3215.44]  I am no longer worthy to be called your son.
[3216.52 --> 3218.70]  But the father said to his servants,
[3219.34 --> 3222.26]  quick, bring the best robe and put it on him.
[3222.62 --> 3223.34]  Bring a ring,
[3223.64 --> 3226.26]  put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.
[3226.78 --> 3228.48]  Bring the fattened calf and kill it.
[3228.56 --> 3230.70]  Let's have a feast and celebrate
[3230.70 --> 3233.14]  for this son of mine was dead
[3233.14 --> 3234.68]  and is alive again.
[3234.86 --> 3236.94]  He was lost and is found.
[3236.94 --> 3239.46]  And so they began to celebrate.
[3241.62 --> 3242.02]  Meanwhile,
[3243.00 --> 3245.26]  the older son was in the field.
[3245.86 --> 3247.20]  When he came near the house,
[3247.54 --> 3249.32]  he heard music and dancing.
[3249.80 --> 3251.60]  And so he called out to one of the servants
[3251.60 --> 3253.32]  and asked what was going on.
[3254.06 --> 3255.14]  Your brother has come,
[3255.28 --> 3255.80]  he replied,
[3255.90 --> 3258.36]  and your father has killed the fattened calf
[3258.36 --> 3261.80]  because he has him back safe and sound.
[3261.80 --> 3265.14]  The older brother became angry
[3265.14 --> 3266.60]  and refused to go in.
[3267.76 --> 3269.10]  And so his father went out
[3269.10 --> 3270.28]  and pleaded with him.
[3271.40 --> 3273.36]  But he answered his father,
[3273.80 --> 3274.80]  Look,
[3275.02 --> 3276.36]  all these years
[3276.36 --> 3278.02]  I have been slaving
[3278.02 --> 3279.10]  for you
[3279.10 --> 3280.92]  and never disobeyed your orders.
[3281.28 --> 3282.62]  Yet you never gave me
[3282.62 --> 3283.80]  even a young goat
[3283.80 --> 3285.64]  so I could celebrate with my friends.
[3286.00 --> 3288.08]  And when this son of yours
[3288.08 --> 3289.68]  who has squandered your property
[3289.68 --> 3291.22]  with prostitutes come home,
[3291.42 --> 3293.42]  you kill the fattened calf for him?
[3294.80 --> 3295.76]  My son,
[3296.22 --> 3297.04]  the father said,
[3297.60 --> 3301.26]  you are always with me
[3301.26 --> 3304.44]  and everything I have is yours.
[3305.36 --> 3307.06]  But we had to celebrate
[3307.06 --> 3308.62]  and be glad
[3308.62 --> 3310.80]  because this brother of yours
[3310.80 --> 3311.58]  was dead
[3311.58 --> 3313.62]  and is alive again.
[3314.40 --> 3315.50]  He was lost
[3315.50 --> 3317.20]  and is found.
[3318.20 --> 3319.52]  This is the word of the Lord.
[3319.68 --> 3326.40]  This morning,
[3326.78 --> 3328.70]  I want to talk to you
[3328.70 --> 3329.44]  about
[3329.44 --> 3332.10]  the presumption
[3332.10 --> 3333.90]  of religiosity.
[3335.70 --> 3336.98]  Now, I know that sounds
[3336.98 --> 3337.76]  a little bit wordy
[3337.76 --> 3338.88]  and it is.
[3339.24 --> 3339.88]  I admit that.
[3340.80 --> 3342.06]  But I also think
[3342.06 --> 3343.14]  that the presumption
[3343.14 --> 3344.38]  of religiosity
[3344.38 --> 3346.90]  that is at root
[3346.90 --> 3348.34]  or at least in part at root
[3348.34 --> 3350.78]  why people leave the faith
[3350.78 --> 3351.78]  that they grew up in,
[3352.32 --> 3353.46]  whether they do so
[3353.46 --> 3354.06]  as young adults
[3354.06 --> 3354.60]  or older.
[3355.34 --> 3356.96]  And I think it's the presumption
[3356.96 --> 3358.16]  of religiosity
[3358.16 --> 3359.72]  that contributes
[3359.72 --> 3361.36]  to the dilemma
[3361.36 --> 3364.14]  of deconstruction
[3364.14 --> 3365.82]  or the phenomenon
[3365.82 --> 3368.04]  of what's called
[3368.04 --> 3369.06]  exvangelical
[3369.06 --> 3370.42]  in the world today.
[3370.42 --> 3371.98]  Now, again,
[3372.10 --> 3372.78]  I realize that
[3372.78 --> 3373.80]  those are a couple words
[3373.80 --> 3374.64]  that you may not
[3374.64 --> 3375.42]  be familiar with
[3375.42 --> 3376.12]  if you don't listen
[3376.12 --> 3377.02]  to the same podcast
[3377.02 --> 3377.86]  circuit that I do.
[3379.44 --> 3379.72]  So,
[3380.74 --> 3382.16]  if you are
[3382.16 --> 3384.28]  40 and older
[3384.28 --> 3385.60]  and kind of grew up
[3385.60 --> 3386.82]  in the Christian Reformed Church,
[3387.34 --> 3388.56]  you might recognize
[3388.56 --> 3389.20]  the name
[3389.20 --> 3390.16]  Josh Harris.
[3391.44 --> 3392.56]  Josh Harris
[3392.56 --> 3394.38]  wrote the book
[3394.38 --> 3395.72]  I Kissed Dating Goodbye.
[3395.72 --> 3395.88]  Right?
[3397.18 --> 3399.72]  And in the early 90s,
[3399.80 --> 3402.36]  it was particularly powerful
[3402.36 --> 3403.74]  in youth ministry
[3403.74 --> 3405.16]  and particularly formative
[3405.16 --> 3406.48]  in youth ministry
[3406.48 --> 3409.26]  and some would say
[3409.26 --> 3411.00]  it is the source
[3411.00 --> 3411.98]  of what became known
[3411.98 --> 3412.90]  as purity culture.
[3413.88 --> 3415.08]  A few years ago,
[3415.38 --> 3416.02]  Josh Harris,
[3416.18 --> 3417.78]  who having written that book,
[3417.94 --> 3418.98]  became a sort of
[3418.98 --> 3420.24]  evangelical superstar,
[3420.86 --> 3421.88]  started pastoring
[3421.88 --> 3423.22]  in a large church.
[3423.22 --> 3426.38]  And then in 2014,
[3426.72 --> 3427.14]  I think,
[3427.48 --> 3427.74]  said,
[3427.82 --> 3428.16]  you know what?
[3428.18 --> 3428.88]  I've been pastoring
[3428.88 --> 3429.96]  for some 20 years.
[3430.32 --> 3430.96]  I should probably
[3430.96 --> 3431.72]  go to seminary.
[3433.06 --> 3434.32]  Went to seminary
[3434.32 --> 3436.06]  and while in seminary,
[3436.30 --> 3436.66]  he, quote,
[3436.78 --> 3437.72]  lost his faith.
[3439.32 --> 3441.32]  He deconstructed
[3441.32 --> 3442.40]  the assumptions
[3442.40 --> 3443.36]  that he had had
[3443.36 --> 3444.14]  about what it means
[3444.14 --> 3444.82]  to be Christian
[3444.82 --> 3446.34]  and to live in the world
[3446.34 --> 3447.88]  and he had lost it.
[3448.14 --> 3449.50]  And now,
[3449.72 --> 3450.24]  Josh Harris,
[3450.34 --> 3450.96]  actually having
[3450.96 --> 3452.26]  divorced his wife
[3452.26 --> 3453.32]  and left his faith,
[3453.92 --> 3456.70]  now has an online program
[3456.70 --> 3457.22]  in school
[3457.22 --> 3458.18]  that you can go to
[3458.18 --> 3459.16]  that helps you
[3459.16 --> 3460.40]  deconstruct your own faith.
[3461.34 --> 3462.14]  So he's become
[3462.14 --> 3463.12]  a missionary
[3463.12 --> 3464.32]  to leave
[3464.32 --> 3465.28]  the Christian faith.
[3466.58 --> 3467.26]  Jen Hatmaker
[3467.26 --> 3468.12]  is another name
[3468.12 --> 3469.18]  maybe you're familiar with,
[3469.30 --> 3469.96]  especially if you're
[3469.96 --> 3471.34]  a woman of a particular age.
[3471.78 --> 3473.14]  She was very influential
[3473.14 --> 3474.00]  in her reading,
[3474.44 --> 3475.12]  in her books,
[3475.40 --> 3476.42]  and in her speaking.
[3477.10 --> 3478.14]  She also recently
[3478.14 --> 3479.98]  deconstructed her faith
[3479.98 --> 3481.32]  and has now
[3481.32 --> 3482.20]  walked away
[3482.20 --> 3482.76]  or at least
[3482.76 --> 3484.06]  dramatically changed
[3484.06 --> 3484.54]  her idea
[3484.54 --> 3485.18]  of what it means
[3485.18 --> 3485.84]  to be Christian
[3485.84 --> 3486.80]  so that it doesn't
[3486.80 --> 3487.58]  look anything like
[3487.58 --> 3488.08]  what she used
[3488.08 --> 3488.66]  to talk about.
[3489.30 --> 3490.14]  Another name here
[3490.14 --> 3491.00]  that you might be
[3491.00 --> 3491.48]  familiar with
[3491.48 --> 3492.64]  is Rhett McLaughlin.
[3493.20 --> 3494.12]  Rhett and Link
[3494.12 --> 3495.08]  have a YouTube channel.
[3495.20 --> 3496.12]  They're YouTube personalities.
[3496.36 --> 3497.02]  They're really famous.
[3498.70 --> 3500.42]  They both were...
[3500.42 --> 3501.18]  Rhett was, I think,
[3501.96 --> 3503.60]  actually like a staffer
[3503.60 --> 3504.84]  with Campus Crusade
[3504.84 --> 3505.34]  for Christ
[3505.34 --> 3506.18]  when he was younger.
[3506.96 --> 3507.38]  He, too,
[3507.46 --> 3508.32]  has a very famous
[3508.32 --> 3509.26]  and well-documented
[3509.26 --> 3511.18]  journey of leaving the faith.
[3511.28 --> 3511.48]  In fact,
[3511.56 --> 3512.64]  just this past week,
[3512.72 --> 3513.02]  I think,
[3513.08 --> 3514.06]  or two weeks ago,
[3514.48 --> 3515.18]  Rhett released
[3515.18 --> 3516.58]  a country music song
[3516.58 --> 3517.72]  documenting
[3517.72 --> 3518.80]  and talking about
[3518.80 --> 3519.54]  his experience
[3519.54 --> 3520.64]  of leaving the faith
[3520.64 --> 3521.52]  that it's now charting
[3521.52 --> 3522.22]  all over the place
[3522.22 --> 3523.38]  because of his influence.
[3523.96 --> 3524.58]  And the song,
[3524.74 --> 3525.54]  I listened to it,
[3525.56 --> 3526.72]  is genuinely heartbreaking
[3526.72 --> 3528.20]  and not just because
[3528.20 --> 3528.88]  it's country music,
[3528.94 --> 3529.86]  which I'm not a fan of,
[3530.62 --> 3532.22]  but the story it tells
[3532.22 --> 3534.28]  is genuinely heartbreaking.
[3534.28 --> 3538.00]  My suggestion,
[3538.66 --> 3539.32]  and part of why
[3539.32 --> 3539.94]  I want to enter
[3539.94 --> 3541.04]  into this conversation,
[3541.26 --> 3542.98]  is that part of why
[3542.98 --> 3543.96]  all of these people
[3543.96 --> 3545.22]  have left the faith
[3545.22 --> 3546.12]  or walked away
[3546.12 --> 3548.66]  is in relation to
[3548.66 --> 3549.88]  the presumption
[3549.88 --> 3551.02]  of religiosity.
[3551.50 --> 3552.24]  We'll get into that.
[3553.24 --> 3555.62]  Now, without that phrase, then,
[3555.68 --> 3556.44]  so the theme
[3556.44 --> 3557.46]  that I want to reflect
[3557.46 --> 3558.26]  with you on,
[3558.56 --> 3559.76]  the sort of big idea
[3559.76 --> 3560.40]  for today,
[3561.14 --> 3561.82]  is this.
[3561.82 --> 3563.46]  The compassion
[3563.46 --> 3564.52]  of the Father
[3564.52 --> 3568.32]  draws and divides.
[3569.40 --> 3570.42]  It really depends
[3570.42 --> 3571.24]  on your perspective.
[3572.76 --> 3573.66]  The compassion
[3573.66 --> 3574.34]  of the Father
[3574.34 --> 3576.42]  draws and divides.
[3577.32 --> 3577.72]  Ultimately,
[3577.86 --> 3578.32]  it depends on
[3578.32 --> 3579.10]  your perspective.
[3579.22 --> 3579.82]  Now, we're going to
[3579.82 --> 3580.54]  dig into that
[3580.54 --> 3581.08]  and we'll define
[3581.08 --> 3581.50]  these things
[3581.50 --> 3582.90]  a little bit more closely,
[3583.04 --> 3583.50]  but first,
[3584.24 --> 3585.38]  let's remind each other
[3585.38 --> 3586.92]  of the stage
[3586.92 --> 3588.18]  that we are on
[3588.18 --> 3588.98]  in this parable.
[3588.98 --> 3590.86]  because Jesus
[3590.86 --> 3592.10]  is talking to
[3592.10 --> 3593.88]  a group of Pharisees
[3593.88 --> 3595.18]  in Luke 15.
[3596.50 --> 3597.06]  Right?
[3597.10 --> 3598.06]  And the Pharisees
[3598.06 --> 3600.48]  are the religious elite
[3600.48 --> 3601.80]  in Jewish culture.
[3602.72 --> 3603.34]  And not just
[3603.34 --> 3604.44]  the religious elite,
[3604.64 --> 3606.30]  Pharisees make up
[3606.30 --> 3608.38]  one half of the Sanhedrin,
[3608.66 --> 3609.52]  which is the Jewish
[3609.52 --> 3610.72]  ruling class.
[3611.36 --> 3611.54]  Right?
[3611.62 --> 3612.40]  And this Jewish
[3612.40 --> 3613.32]  ruling class,
[3613.64 --> 3614.90]  by virtue of their
[3614.90 --> 3616.06]  own political savvy,
[3616.26 --> 3618.52]  has managed to carve out
[3618.52 --> 3619.46]  a small little
[3619.46 --> 3620.68]  corner of autonomy
[3620.68 --> 3622.26]  in the Roman Empire
[3622.26 --> 3623.78]  of which they were subjects.
[3624.18 --> 3625.58]  So, in Judea,
[3625.98 --> 3626.96]  the Sanhedrin
[3626.96 --> 3628.68]  carries a lot of authority
[3628.68 --> 3630.12]  and a lot of weight.
[3631.22 --> 3631.44]  Right?
[3631.48 --> 3632.50]  And the Pharisees,
[3632.58 --> 3633.56]  as religious leaders,
[3633.70 --> 3634.50]  are not just
[3634.50 --> 3635.72]  then religious leaders,
[3635.82 --> 3636.46]  but they're social
[3636.46 --> 3637.60]  and political leaders
[3637.60 --> 3638.26]  as well.
[3638.48 --> 3639.36]  These men
[3639.36 --> 3640.40]  are the movers
[3640.40 --> 3641.60]  and shakers
[3641.60 --> 3642.38]  of the world.
[3642.46 --> 3643.26]  They hold
[3643.26 --> 3645.60]  social and religious power
[3645.60 --> 3647.00]  for the population
[3647.00 --> 3648.72]  over which they lead.
[3649.38 --> 3649.56]  Right?
[3649.60 --> 3650.22]  They determine
[3650.22 --> 3651.48]  people's futures
[3651.48 --> 3653.56]  and people's standing
[3653.56 --> 3655.02]  by their decrees,
[3655.12 --> 3656.28]  by their will.
[3657.40 --> 3658.86]  If the Jewish religion
[3658.86 --> 3659.76]  of this day
[3659.76 --> 3660.98]  had a poster child,
[3661.72 --> 3663.04]  it would be a Pharisee.
[3664.66 --> 3664.84]  Right?
[3664.88 --> 3665.50]  These are people
[3665.50 --> 3666.20]  of status
[3666.20 --> 3667.34]  and prestige
[3667.34 --> 3669.10]  who are now
[3669.10 --> 3669.90]  muttering
[3669.90 --> 3672.00]  because Jesus,
[3672.40 --> 3673.54]  who is a rabbi,
[3673.54 --> 3674.66]  is eating
[3674.66 --> 3676.54]  with tax collectors
[3676.54 --> 3677.92]  and sinners.
[3679.14 --> 3680.38]  And that's the stage
[3680.38 --> 3681.00]  that we're on.
[3681.14 --> 3681.32]  Right?
[3681.50 --> 3682.50]  You've got the cultural
[3682.50 --> 3683.90]  and religious elite
[3683.90 --> 3684.94]  on one side
[3684.94 --> 3686.36]  and the lowest
[3686.36 --> 3687.30]  of the low
[3687.30 --> 3688.52]  on the other side.
[3689.48 --> 3690.46]  And Jesus
[3690.46 --> 3692.20]  isn't in the middle
[3692.20 --> 3693.88]  of both groups.
[3694.32 --> 3695.46]  He's in the middle
[3695.46 --> 3696.20]  of the lowest
[3696.20 --> 3696.74]  of the low.
[3697.76 --> 3698.78]  He's in the middle
[3698.78 --> 3699.82]  of the tax collectors
[3699.82 --> 3701.20]  and the sinners.
[3701.72 --> 3702.24]  And so,
[3702.56 --> 3703.48]  the elite
[3703.48 --> 3704.68]  mutter.
[3705.16 --> 3706.20]  They grumble.
[3707.42 --> 3707.56]  Now,
[3707.58 --> 3707.88]  as I was
[3707.88 --> 3709.24]  thinking about this,
[3709.34 --> 3711.02]  I liken their grumbling
[3711.02 --> 3712.42]  to that
[3712.42 --> 3714.84]  not-so-careful
[3714.84 --> 3715.34]  whisper
[3715.34 --> 3716.82]  that you sometimes
[3716.82 --> 3718.22]  hear people use.
[3718.30 --> 3718.46]  Right?
[3718.52 --> 3719.46]  That they say
[3719.46 --> 3720.26]  to make sure
[3720.26 --> 3720.92]  that the person
[3720.92 --> 3721.88]  they're talking about
[3721.88 --> 3722.88]  hears it
[3722.88 --> 3725.54]  but not loud enough
[3725.54 --> 3727.50]  to be overtly aggressive
[3727.50 --> 3728.92]  but just loud enough
[3728.92 --> 3729.82]  to be passively
[3729.82 --> 3730.76]  aggressive.
[3731.38 --> 3731.54]  Right?
[3731.60 --> 3732.20]  You hear it
[3732.20 --> 3732.56]  and you know
[3732.56 --> 3733.26]  it's going to hurt
[3733.26 --> 3735.36]  but it's still
[3735.36 --> 3735.84]  a whisper.
[3735.96 --> 3736.78]  It's a whisper
[3736.78 --> 3737.30]  that's meant
[3737.30 --> 3738.32]  to cut.
[3739.72 --> 3740.12]  Now,
[3740.20 --> 3740.54]  I don't want
[3740.54 --> 3740.98]  to say anything
[3740.98 --> 3741.68]  about those of you
[3741.68 --> 3742.58]  who are high school age
[3742.58 --> 3743.48]  now but when I was
[3743.48 --> 3744.08]  in high school
[3744.08 --> 3745.82]  that tone of voice
[3745.82 --> 3746.86]  was really popular
[3746.86 --> 3747.64]  among the girls.
[3749.00 --> 3749.44]  Right?
[3749.48 --> 3750.10]  That's how girls
[3750.10 --> 3751.76]  talked about each other.
[3751.88 --> 3752.00]  Now,
[3752.02 --> 3753.00]  maybe you're probably
[3753.00 --> 3754.02]  all better than that now
[3754.02 --> 3755.14]  and yet,
[3755.34 --> 3756.00]  I saw a few of you
[3756.00 --> 3756.22]  nod.
[3756.22 --> 3758.66]  And look,
[3759.80 --> 3760.46]  complainers
[3760.46 --> 3761.36]  are going to complain.
[3762.40 --> 3763.38]  That's just what they do.
[3764.66 --> 3765.02]  Right?
[3765.06 --> 3766.02]  And I want to say that again.
[3766.26 --> 3767.26]  Complainers are going to complain.
[3767.36 --> 3768.08]  That's just what they do.
[3768.18 --> 3768.42]  And so,
[3768.78 --> 3769.02]  I mean,
[3769.06 --> 3770.06]  if you're a complainer,
[3770.36 --> 3771.06]  recognize I know
[3771.06 --> 3771.88]  that's just what you do.
[3772.22 --> 3772.38]  So,
[3772.42 --> 3773.22]  I give your complaints
[3773.22 --> 3774.40]  the appropriate amount of weight.
[3774.80 --> 3775.56]  But that's not
[3775.56 --> 3776.38]  what's happening here.
[3777.34 --> 3777.52]  Right?
[3777.58 --> 3778.46]  This is something
[3778.46 --> 3779.26]  different.
[3780.26 --> 3781.06]  These people
[3781.06 --> 3782.16]  have comfortably
[3782.16 --> 3783.36]  sat in privilege
[3783.36 --> 3784.68]  and in power
[3784.68 --> 3786.14]  over the society
[3786.14 --> 3786.96]  and Jesus
[3786.96 --> 3787.84]  isn't respecting
[3787.84 --> 3788.38]  the rules.
[3789.54 --> 3790.60]  He isn't respecting
[3790.60 --> 3791.44]  the roles.
[3792.30 --> 3792.40]  Right?
[3792.42 --> 3792.94]  He's upsetting
[3792.94 --> 3793.70]  the system.
[3793.94 --> 3794.62]  He's challenging
[3794.62 --> 3795.56]  the status quo
[3795.56 --> 3797.16]  and he's poking
[3797.16 --> 3799.22]  at the carefully
[3799.22 --> 3800.26]  crafted
[3800.26 --> 3801.46]  but ultimately
[3801.46 --> 3802.36]  artificial
[3802.36 --> 3803.74]  superstructure
[3803.74 --> 3804.62]  of their power
[3804.62 --> 3805.58]  and authority
[3805.58 --> 3806.84]  and as they listen
[3806.84 --> 3807.30]  to him
[3807.30 --> 3808.06]  and see him
[3808.06 --> 3809.30]  they are imagining
[3809.30 --> 3810.48]  it all crumble.
[3811.58 --> 3812.32]  He's not playing
[3812.32 --> 3813.16]  by their rules
[3813.16 --> 3814.02]  and they aren't
[3814.02 --> 3815.56]  happy about it.
[3817.58 --> 3818.18]  Eventually,
[3818.52 --> 3819.12]  they're muttering
[3819.12 --> 3820.08]  in groups
[3820.08 --> 3820.98]  and whispered
[3820.98 --> 3821.68]  conversations.
[3822.02 --> 3822.16]  Right?
[3822.18 --> 3823.22]  If you take the story
[3823.22 --> 3823.78]  through the rest
[3823.78 --> 3824.40]  of the gospel
[3824.40 --> 3825.42]  turns into
[3825.42 --> 3826.30]  backroom deals
[3826.30 --> 3826.96]  of betrayal
[3826.96 --> 3827.98]  and that leads
[3827.98 --> 3828.52]  to shouts
[3828.52 --> 3829.84]  of crucify him
[3829.84 --> 3831.18]  in the palace square.
[3832.94 --> 3834.48]  And don't miss this.
[3836.40 --> 3837.00]  Jesus
[3837.00 --> 3838.34]  knows
[3838.34 --> 3839.28]  all of them.
[3841.18 --> 3841.70]  He knows
[3841.70 --> 3842.78]  their hearts
[3842.78 --> 3844.38]  and he knows
[3844.38 --> 3845.22]  exactly
[3845.22 --> 3846.76]  where this is going.
[3847.76 --> 3847.86]  Right?
[3847.96 --> 3849.18]  Everything he says
[3849.18 --> 3849.82]  and does
[3849.82 --> 3850.46]  is done
[3850.46 --> 3852.34]  in Luke's gospel
[3852.34 --> 3853.30]  after chapter 9
[3853.30 --> 3854.20]  in what Luke writes
[3854.20 --> 3854.84]  is the shadow
[3854.84 --> 3855.52]  of the cross.
[3855.60 --> 3856.22]  So Jesus knows
[3856.22 --> 3856.92]  exactly
[3856.92 --> 3858.30]  where this is all going.
[3858.40 --> 3858.84]  He knows
[3858.84 --> 3859.40]  their hearts.
[3859.74 --> 3860.22]  He knows
[3860.22 --> 3861.06]  where his mission
[3861.06 --> 3861.60]  will take him.
[3861.66 --> 3862.24]  He knows
[3862.24 --> 3863.16]  that the cross
[3863.16 --> 3863.78]  is coming
[3863.78 --> 3865.30]  and then to expose
[3865.30 --> 3866.70]  and to address
[3866.70 --> 3867.70]  the presumption
[3867.70 --> 3868.68]  of their own
[3868.68 --> 3869.80]  privilege and power,
[3869.80 --> 3870.48]  the presumption
[3870.48 --> 3871.84]  of their religiosity,
[3872.34 --> 3872.48]  right,
[3872.50 --> 3873.68]  to reveal the depths
[3873.68 --> 3875.10]  of their own heart,
[3875.26 --> 3876.16]  to show the truth
[3876.16 --> 3877.50]  of their own misunderstanding,
[3877.88 --> 3878.72]  Jesus tells them
[3878.72 --> 3879.36]  our story.
[3880.86 --> 3881.44]  He tells them
[3881.44 --> 3882.54]  three stories
[3882.54 --> 3884.52]  in this chapter 15.
[3885.12 --> 3885.62]  Our focus
[3885.62 --> 3886.22]  is on the third.
[3887.50 --> 3887.86]  Like I said,
[3887.92 --> 3888.36]  most of you
[3888.36 --> 3888.82]  are probably
[3888.82 --> 3889.60]  really familiar
[3889.60 --> 3891.10]  with this story,
[3891.46 --> 3891.70]  right?
[3891.74 --> 3892.78]  You probably know it
[3892.78 --> 3893.92]  as the prodigal son.
[3894.30 --> 3895.22]  Maybe you're familiar
[3895.22 --> 3896.00]  with the famous
[3896.00 --> 3897.04]  Rembrandt painting.
[3897.18 --> 3897.64]  I think we have
[3897.64 --> 3898.92]  a copy of it.
[3899.76 --> 3900.94]  The Rembrandt painting
[3900.94 --> 3903.66]  is one of those paintings
[3903.66 --> 3905.64]  that has moved me
[3905.64 --> 3907.70]  even as I look at it.
[3908.78 --> 3909.82]  Art historians
[3909.82 --> 3910.40]  will tell you
[3910.40 --> 3911.16]  that this is like
[3911.16 --> 3912.00]  the height
[3912.00 --> 3913.56]  of Rembrandt's skill
[3913.56 --> 3914.24]  and craft
[3914.24 --> 3914.96]  and the way
[3914.96 --> 3916.04]  he's able to convey
[3916.04 --> 3916.68]  the spirituality
[3916.68 --> 3918.10]  here in his realistic
[3918.10 --> 3918.56]  structures
[3918.56 --> 3920.02]  is just profound
[3920.02 --> 3921.06]  and amazing.
[3923.06 --> 3923.92]  So we know
[3923.92 --> 3925.50]  this story,
[3925.94 --> 3926.62]  this parable,
[3926.62 --> 3927.16]  along with
[3927.16 --> 3928.00]  the Good Samaritan
[3928.00 --> 3928.86]  is perhaps
[3928.86 --> 3929.78]  the one that you
[3929.78 --> 3930.28]  think about
[3930.28 --> 3930.76]  when you think
[3930.76 --> 3931.40]  of the parables
[3931.40 --> 3932.42]  of Jesus,
[3933.20 --> 3933.38]  right?
[3933.40 --> 3934.38]  And there's a lot here
[3934.38 --> 3935.18]  and so no wonder
[3935.18 --> 3936.52]  it's full.
[3937.18 --> 3937.88]  The point is
[3937.88 --> 3938.68]  in outlining
[3938.68 --> 3939.24]  all of this
[3939.24 --> 3939.82]  is that I want you
[3939.82 --> 3940.42]  to take our
[3940.42 --> 3941.42]  conversation here,
[3941.54 --> 3942.32]  take what we're
[3942.32 --> 3943.08]  talking about here
[3943.08 --> 3943.58]  this morning
[3943.58 --> 3944.68]  as a starter
[3944.68 --> 3945.68]  to a conversation
[3945.68 --> 3946.60]  that you can continue
[3946.60 --> 3947.54]  with your family
[3947.54 --> 3948.24]  or your friends
[3948.24 --> 3948.90]  with your kids
[3948.90 --> 3949.88]  or grandkids
[3949.88 --> 3950.66]  or with your parents
[3950.66 --> 3951.58]  or whomever,
[3951.92 --> 3952.04]  right?
[3952.08 --> 3953.12]  Keep the discussions
[3953.12 --> 3955.52]  going through the week.
[3956.62 --> 3956.98]  So,
[3957.62 --> 3958.40]  you know the story,
[3958.48 --> 3959.22]  we read the story,
[3959.86 --> 3960.06]  right?
[3960.12 --> 3960.98]  A young son
[3960.98 --> 3962.38]  says to his father,
[3962.66 --> 3962.96]  Dad,
[3963.16 --> 3964.30]  I want my share
[3964.30 --> 3965.14]  of the estate
[3965.14 --> 3965.98]  or Dad,
[3966.08 --> 3967.26]  I want my inheritance.
[3968.66 --> 3968.90]  Now,
[3969.16 --> 3970.50]  I don't want to be
[3970.50 --> 3971.00]  crass,
[3972.00 --> 3973.16]  but get what
[3973.16 --> 3973.74]  that means.
[3974.86 --> 3975.78]  This is a son
[3975.78 --> 3976.80]  coming up to his father
[3976.80 --> 3977.18]  saying,
[3977.34 --> 3977.56]  Dad,
[3978.00 --> 3979.90]  I wish you were dead.
[3979.90 --> 3984.48]  From a spiritual
[3984.48 --> 3985.26]  point of view,
[3986.16 --> 3987.30]  what that reveals
[3987.30 --> 3988.58]  is that this younger
[3988.58 --> 3990.12]  son is actually
[3990.12 --> 3990.92]  already the one
[3990.92 --> 3991.48]  who's dead
[3991.48 --> 3992.36]  on the inside,
[3993.54 --> 3993.68]  right?
[3993.72 --> 3994.28]  And the father
[3994.28 --> 3995.08]  acknowledges that
[3995.08 --> 3995.86]  as the son returns.
[3995.98 --> 3997.20]  My son was dead,
[3997.40 --> 3998.08]  but he has come
[3998.08 --> 3998.84]  back to us,
[3999.04 --> 3999.20]  right?
[3999.22 --> 4000.60]  He is spiritually dead.
[4000.68 --> 4002.32]  He has had a hole
[4002.32 --> 4004.14]  in his life
[4004.14 --> 4005.12]  and he believes
[4005.12 --> 4006.32]  that if he takes
[4006.32 --> 4007.22]  this inheritance,
[4007.52 --> 4008.14]  this wealth,
[4008.14 --> 4009.14]  and then he goes
[4009.14 --> 4010.58]  and lives frivolously,
[4010.78 --> 4011.86]  if he takes the riches
[4011.86 --> 4013.32]  and spends it on parties
[4013.32 --> 4014.42]  and on fine food
[4014.42 --> 4015.32]  and on women
[4015.32 --> 4016.30]  and things,
[4016.44 --> 4017.76]  that he might finally
[4017.76 --> 4019.12]  have satisfaction.
[4019.36 --> 4020.08]  He might finally
[4020.08 --> 4021.26]  find joy.
[4021.62 --> 4021.90]  Really,
[4022.08 --> 4023.96]  there's a joy vacuum
[4023.96 --> 4025.16]  in his heart
[4025.16 --> 4026.24]  and he believes
[4026.24 --> 4027.16]  that things
[4027.16 --> 4028.08]  will fill it.
[4029.08 --> 4030.10]  And he needs
[4030.10 --> 4031.50]  the father to die
[4031.50 --> 4032.82]  in order to get that.
[4035.26 --> 4035.82]  Now,
[4035.92 --> 4036.30]  at root,
[4036.30 --> 4038.72]  spiritual belief
[4038.72 --> 4039.08]  here
[4039.08 --> 4040.48]  is this.
[4042.48 --> 4043.62]  If I could just
[4043.62 --> 4044.48]  have this
[4044.48 --> 4045.48]  thing
[4045.48 --> 4046.68]  or that thing,
[4046.86 --> 4047.88]  I would be happy.
[4049.42 --> 4049.54]  Right?
[4049.62 --> 4050.86]  And to get that thing,
[4050.94 --> 4051.80]  he believes
[4051.80 --> 4053.04]  that he can no longer
[4053.04 --> 4054.20]  be under the thumb
[4054.20 --> 4055.42]  of his father.
[4055.74 --> 4056.66]  His father needs
[4056.66 --> 4057.12]  to die.
[4058.74 --> 4059.94]  And then the father,
[4060.80 --> 4061.04]  right,
[4061.14 --> 4061.88]  in an act
[4061.88 --> 4062.92]  that can only
[4062.92 --> 4063.74]  be understood
[4063.74 --> 4065.50]  as one of immense
[4065.50 --> 4066.42]  grace
[4066.42 --> 4067.76]  and selflessness,
[4068.18 --> 4069.18]  permits the son
[4069.18 --> 4070.24]  the freedom
[4070.24 --> 4071.72]  to go the way
[4071.72 --> 4072.60]  of his choosing.
[4074.64 --> 4075.26]  And again,
[4075.34 --> 4076.06]  you know the results,
[4076.16 --> 4076.32]  right?
[4076.38 --> 4076.92]  For a while,
[4077.02 --> 4077.70]  it works out,
[4078.12 --> 4079.46]  but not for long.
[4079.94 --> 4080.24]  Eventually,
[4080.32 --> 4081.08]  the money runs out,
[4081.16 --> 4082.08]  the good times pass,
[4082.12 --> 4082.66]  and the so-called
[4082.66 --> 4083.88]  friends made along the way
[4083.88 --> 4084.70]  seem to disappear.
[4085.48 --> 4086.60]  And with nothing left
[4086.60 --> 4087.62]  but only the company
[4087.62 --> 4088.26]  and food
[4088.26 --> 4090.08]  of unclean pigs,
[4090.08 --> 4091.12]  he remembers
[4091.12 --> 4092.72]  his father.
[4093.96 --> 4094.54]  And remembering
[4094.54 --> 4095.16]  his father,
[4095.32 --> 4095.78]  he thinks,
[4096.12 --> 4096.92]  maybe he will
[4096.92 --> 4097.58]  accept me
[4097.58 --> 4098.36]  as a slave
[4098.36 --> 4099.54]  if I return to him.
[4100.44 --> 4100.90]  But the father
[4100.90 --> 4101.92]  doesn't just accept him
[4101.92 --> 4102.64]  as a slave,
[4102.82 --> 4103.74]  he welcomes him back
[4103.74 --> 4104.60]  as a son,
[4104.72 --> 4105.50]  back from the dead.
[4105.60 --> 4106.50]  He runs out
[4106.50 --> 4107.38]  to greet him.
[4107.42 --> 4107.72]  And again,
[4107.82 --> 4108.20]  hear that,
[4108.24 --> 4109.56]  a father running
[4109.56 --> 4110.46]  to a son,
[4110.80 --> 4111.98]  especially a son
[4111.98 --> 4113.46]  who has scorned
[4113.46 --> 4114.32]  him in that way,
[4114.38 --> 4114.76]  would have been
[4114.76 --> 4115.30]  the height
[4115.30 --> 4116.26]  of humility
[4116.26 --> 4117.34]  for the father
[4117.34 --> 4118.28]  in the ancient
[4118.28 --> 4119.08]  Near Eastern culture.
[4119.08 --> 4120.48]  It would be an indignity
[4120.48 --> 4122.06]  to see this man run,
[4122.32 --> 4122.82]  but the father
[4122.82 --> 4123.40]  doesn't care.
[4124.24 --> 4124.82]  He runs.
[4125.62 --> 4126.38]  And he welcomes
[4126.38 --> 4126.94]  his son
[4126.94 --> 4128.12]  with open arms
[4128.12 --> 4128.90]  and he calls
[4128.90 --> 4129.56]  for a feast
[4129.56 --> 4130.94]  and he clothes him
[4130.94 --> 4132.08]  in the best robes.
[4132.12 --> 4132.80]  He puts a ring
[4132.80 --> 4133.70]  on his finger.
[4133.84 --> 4134.72]  He welcomes him
[4134.72 --> 4136.28]  back as a son.
[4138.68 --> 4138.90]  Now,
[4139.20 --> 4140.86]  it's actually
[4140.86 --> 4141.20]  going to be
[4141.20 --> 4141.94]  the other brother
[4141.94 --> 4143.44]  that I want to spend
[4143.44 --> 4144.76]  most of our time
[4144.76 --> 4145.58]  digging into
[4145.58 --> 4146.56]  this morning.
[4147.30 --> 4148.26]  But before I jump
[4148.26 --> 4148.70]  to him,
[4148.70 --> 4149.78]  another word
[4149.78 --> 4150.96]  about this brother.
[4151.72 --> 4152.38]  Like I've said,
[4152.44 --> 4153.84]  you've heard this story.
[4155.10 --> 4156.30]  If you're using
[4156.30 --> 4158.38]  a certain translation
[4158.38 --> 4158.92]  of the Bible,
[4159.06 --> 4159.86]  the heading here
[4159.86 --> 4160.86]  probably even says
[4160.86 --> 4161.78]  the prodigal son.
[4163.00 --> 4163.60]  And culturally,
[4164.36 --> 4165.32]  we use that word
[4165.32 --> 4166.02]  prodigal
[4166.02 --> 4167.36]  to mean
[4167.36 --> 4168.20]  lost
[4168.20 --> 4169.50]  or to mean
[4169.50 --> 4170.32]  wandering.
[4171.28 --> 4171.70]  Right?
[4171.74 --> 4172.20]  You might hear
[4172.20 --> 4172.86]  someone say,
[4173.16 --> 4174.18]  I was a prodigal
[4174.18 --> 4174.96]  for a while.
[4175.66 --> 4175.78]  Right?
[4175.78 --> 4176.48]  And what they mean
[4176.48 --> 4177.06]  by that is that
[4177.06 --> 4177.74]  they were wandering
[4177.74 --> 4178.56]  away from
[4178.56 --> 4180.26]  whatever it was,
[4180.32 --> 4180.94]  whatever community
[4180.94 --> 4181.74]  they were part of.
[4181.78 --> 4182.32]  They wandered,
[4182.46 --> 4183.34]  they got lost.
[4184.04 --> 4184.76]  And really,
[4185.18 --> 4185.32]  right,
[4185.38 --> 4186.30]  outside of the context
[4186.30 --> 4187.02]  of this parable,
[4187.10 --> 4187.84]  the word prodigal
[4187.84 --> 4188.46]  is not one
[4188.46 --> 4189.32]  that we use
[4189.32 --> 4190.16]  regularly.
[4192.16 --> 4192.74]  And so,
[4192.80 --> 4193.58]  you might be surprised
[4193.58 --> 4194.10]  to learn
[4194.10 --> 4194.60]  that the word
[4194.60 --> 4195.14]  prodigal
[4195.14 --> 4195.80]  doesn't mean
[4195.80 --> 4196.40]  lost.
[4197.16 --> 4197.96]  It doesn't mean
[4197.96 --> 4198.58]  wandering.
[4200.38 --> 4200.78]  Prodigal,
[4200.78 --> 4201.62]  as an adjective,
[4202.18 --> 4203.02]  means spending
[4203.02 --> 4204.08]  money or resources
[4204.08 --> 4205.40]  freely and recklessly.
[4205.64 --> 4206.10]  It means being
[4206.10 --> 4207.52]  wastefully extravagant.
[4207.82 --> 4208.52]  It means having
[4208.52 --> 4209.48]  or giving something
[4209.48 --> 4210.92]  on a lavish scale.
[4211.80 --> 4212.14]  Prodigal,
[4212.28 --> 4212.82]  as a noun,
[4213.00 --> 4213.58]  is a person
[4213.58 --> 4214.50]  who spends money
[4214.50 --> 4215.28]  in a recklessly
[4215.28 --> 4216.72]  extravagant way.
[4217.44 --> 4217.62]  And so,
[4217.68 --> 4218.12]  when we talk about
[4218.12 --> 4218.88]  the prodigal son,
[4218.96 --> 4219.38]  we're not talking
[4219.38 --> 4220.16]  about his lostness
[4220.16 --> 4220.78]  or his wandering,
[4220.90 --> 4221.24]  but the way
[4221.24 --> 4221.80]  that he spends
[4221.80 --> 4223.40]  his father's wealth.
[4224.54 --> 4224.72]  Right?
[4225.10 --> 4225.72]  Squandering it
[4225.72 --> 4226.40]  on drink
[4226.40 --> 4227.64]  and prostitutes
[4227.64 --> 4228.72]  and parties.
[4229.54 --> 4230.14]  But also,
[4230.14 --> 4232.74]  even more so,
[4233.12 --> 4233.92]  in this second
[4233.92 --> 4235.20]  definition there
[4235.20 --> 4236.26]  of having
[4236.26 --> 4237.20]  or giving something
[4237.20 --> 4238.48]  on a lavish scale,
[4238.74 --> 4239.38]  I have a question
[4239.38 --> 4239.82]  for you.
[4240.82 --> 4241.90]  Who gives
[4241.90 --> 4243.18]  on a lavish scale
[4243.18 --> 4244.22]  in this parable?
[4246.58 --> 4247.52]  The father.
[4249.02 --> 4249.92]  The father
[4249.92 --> 4250.60]  is the one
[4250.60 --> 4251.58]  who is acting
[4251.58 --> 4252.62]  prodigiously.
[4253.28 --> 4253.74]  That's the
[4253.74 --> 4254.60]  adverbial form
[4254.60 --> 4255.30]  for those of you
[4255.30 --> 4255.60]  who care.
[4256.46 --> 4257.46]  The father
[4257.46 --> 4258.98]  is the one
[4258.98 --> 4260.92]  who is waiting
[4260.92 --> 4262.06]  and is looking.
[4262.78 --> 4263.70]  And when we see
[4263.70 --> 4264.52]  the father
[4264.52 --> 4265.86]  as a stand-in
[4265.86 --> 4266.70]  in the story
[4266.70 --> 4267.72]  for God,
[4267.82 --> 4268.36]  what we learn
[4268.36 --> 4269.32]  is that God
[4269.32 --> 4270.04]  is the one
[4270.04 --> 4270.78]  who is giving
[4270.78 --> 4271.98]  lavishly.
[4272.84 --> 4272.96]  Right?
[4272.96 --> 4273.48]  It's the grace
[4273.48 --> 4274.12]  of God
[4274.12 --> 4274.70]  that is an
[4274.70 --> 4276.30]  impossibly lavish
[4276.30 --> 4276.94]  gift.
[4277.04 --> 4277.86]  It is given
[4277.86 --> 4278.42]  to those
[4278.42 --> 4279.22]  who are ultimately
[4279.22 --> 4280.46]  undeserving,
[4280.66 --> 4281.10]  or rather,
[4281.22 --> 4282.90]  those who are
[4282.90 --> 4283.92]  ultimately
[4283.92 --> 4285.00]  deserving punishment.
[4285.00 --> 4287.04]  but he welcomes
[4287.04 --> 4287.80]  us home
[4287.80 --> 4288.86]  as if raised
[4288.86 --> 4289.88]  from the dead.
[4291.06 --> 4291.72]  And so the real
[4291.72 --> 4292.98]  prodigal in this
[4292.98 --> 4294.28]  story is the
[4294.28 --> 4294.74]  father.
[4295.16 --> 4295.96]  It's God.
[4296.90 --> 4297.04]  Right?
[4297.10 --> 4297.82]  And so I've
[4297.82 --> 4298.58]  called this parable
[4298.58 --> 4299.80]  two lost sons
[4299.80 --> 4300.76]  and a prodigal
[4300.76 --> 4301.06]  God.
[4301.12 --> 4301.52]  And I just want
[4301.52 --> 4302.48]  to give that to
[4302.48 --> 4303.24]  you and let that
[4303.24 --> 4304.06]  bounce around in
[4304.06 --> 4304.56]  your brains
[4304.56 --> 4305.84]  this week and
[4305.84 --> 4307.36]  think what does
[4307.36 --> 4308.88]  that mean for
[4308.88 --> 4309.40]  how you see
[4309.40 --> 4309.70]  God.
[4311.32 --> 4312.10]  But for now,
[4312.46 --> 4313.30]  back to the
[4313.30 --> 4313.72]  second brother.
[4313.72 --> 4315.96]  So on the one
[4315.96 --> 4316.96]  hand, you have
[4316.96 --> 4317.44]  a brother, you
[4317.44 --> 4318.00]  have a son,
[4318.20 --> 4318.90]  right, who wants
[4318.90 --> 4319.84]  his father dead
[4319.84 --> 4320.68]  but who remembers
[4320.68 --> 4321.26]  him later.
[4322.30 --> 4323.08]  And then you
[4323.08 --> 4323.66]  have this other
[4323.66 --> 4323.92]  son.
[4324.94 --> 4325.60]  And like I said,
[4325.66 --> 4326.18]  it's this other
[4326.18 --> 4327.24]  son who interests
[4327.24 --> 4328.62]  me this morning
[4328.62 --> 4329.44]  as we think about
[4329.44 --> 4330.10]  the presumption
[4330.10 --> 4331.44]  of religiosity.
[4332.62 --> 4332.74]  Right?
[4332.78 --> 4333.88]  The older son
[4333.88 --> 4334.96]  is the one for
[4334.96 --> 4335.88]  whom the father
[4335.88 --> 4337.40]  has always been
[4337.40 --> 4337.76]  dead.
[4338.56 --> 4339.90]  And so the son
[4339.90 --> 4340.46]  has forgotten
[4340.46 --> 4340.94]  himself.
[4341.94 --> 4342.76]  So the younger
[4342.76 --> 4343.62]  son wishes his
[4343.62 --> 4344.42]  father dead but
[4344.42 --> 4345.10]  remembers him
[4345.10 --> 4345.40]  later.
[4346.12 --> 4347.26]  The older son,
[4347.38 --> 4347.88]  the father has
[4347.88 --> 4348.90]  always been dead
[4348.90 --> 4350.14]  and so forgets
[4350.14 --> 4351.10]  himself.
[4352.38 --> 4352.90]  Right?
[4352.94 --> 4353.64]  The first wants
[4353.64 --> 4354.52]  his father dead.
[4354.78 --> 4355.36]  The second,
[4355.96 --> 4356.44]  the father's
[4356.44 --> 4357.02]  already dead.
[4357.98 --> 4359.22]  The first remembers
[4359.22 --> 4360.68]  his father and
[4360.68 --> 4361.26]  his mercy.
[4361.72 --> 4363.14]  The second forgets
[4363.14 --> 4364.10]  who he already
[4364.10 --> 4364.46]  is.
[4365.46 --> 4366.30]  See what I mean
[4366.30 --> 4367.06]  when we look.
[4368.12 --> 4369.04]  The younger son
[4369.04 --> 4369.68]  comes home.
[4369.76 --> 4370.46]  His father runs
[4370.46 --> 4371.00]  out to him.
[4371.00 --> 4371.72]  He welcomes him
[4371.72 --> 4372.58]  back as a son
[4372.58 --> 4374.02]  not just in mercy
[4374.02 --> 4375.02]  but in full
[4375.02 --> 4375.92]  restoration to
[4375.92 --> 4376.36]  sonship.
[4376.44 --> 4377.32]  He throws a feast
[4377.32 --> 4378.46]  to celebrate his
[4378.46 --> 4379.78]  return and the
[4379.78 --> 4380.36]  older brother
[4380.36 --> 4381.30]  doesn't come.
[4382.40 --> 4383.26]  He's out in the
[4383.26 --> 4383.52]  field,
[4384.20 --> 4385.58]  probably working,
[4386.64 --> 4387.72]  definitely sulking.
[4387.72 --> 4390.90]  But the father
[4390.90 --> 4391.70]  goes out to that
[4391.70 --> 4393.20]  son too.
[4394.26 --> 4395.12]  And the father
[4395.12 --> 4396.12]  pleads with that
[4396.12 --> 4397.64]  son as well and
[4397.64 --> 4397.88]  he says,
[4398.24 --> 4398.88]  come to the
[4398.88 --> 4399.24]  party.
[4399.52 --> 4400.48]  But that son is
[4400.48 --> 4401.28]  too angry.
[4402.06 --> 4402.18]  Right?
[4402.22 --> 4402.48]  He says,
[4402.58 --> 4403.60]  all these years
[4403.60 --> 4404.68]  I've been slaving
[4404.68 --> 4406.38]  for you and
[4406.38 --> 4407.54]  I've never
[4407.54 --> 4408.46]  disobeyed.
[4409.74 --> 4410.40]  Notice the
[4410.40 --> 4411.26]  language that the
[4411.26 --> 4411.72]  older brother
[4411.72 --> 4412.44]  uses.
[4412.82 --> 4412.94]  Right?
[4412.94 --> 4413.42]  He says he's
[4413.42 --> 4415.00]  been slaving for
[4415.00 --> 4415.56]  his father.
[4415.56 --> 4416.96]  Now does that
[4416.96 --> 4417.48]  sound like he
[4417.48 --> 4417.94]  likes what he
[4417.94 --> 4418.24]  does?
[4420.12 --> 4420.64]  Right?
[4420.66 --> 4422.08]  As a slave for
[4422.08 --> 4423.02]  the father he's
[4423.02 --> 4424.14]  never disobeyed.
[4424.72 --> 4425.78]  Does that sound
[4425.78 --> 4426.42]  like joyful
[4426.42 --> 4427.54]  obedience to you?
[4428.14 --> 4428.90]  Or is it
[4428.90 --> 4429.44]  something else?
[4431.12 --> 4431.26]  Right?
[4431.28 --> 4432.04]  If the younger
[4432.04 --> 4432.94]  son wanted to
[4432.94 --> 4433.78]  find joyful
[4433.78 --> 4434.62]  living in
[4434.62 --> 4435.32]  prostitutes and
[4435.32 --> 4435.82]  in squandering
[4435.82 --> 4436.56]  his inheritance,
[4436.84 --> 4437.80]  the older brother
[4437.80 --> 4438.86]  never knew joyful
[4438.86 --> 4439.76]  living either.
[4440.56 --> 4440.94]  Right?
[4440.94 --> 4441.52]  He might be
[4441.52 --> 4442.56]  doing what is
[4442.56 --> 4443.00]  right.
[4443.52 --> 4444.06]  He might be able
[4444.06 --> 4444.72]  to check off
[4444.72 --> 4445.30]  all of those
[4445.30 --> 4445.80]  boxes,
[4446.04 --> 4446.54]  but it's not
[4446.54 --> 4447.28]  out of joy.
[4447.76 --> 4448.18]  It's not in
[4448.18 --> 4449.16]  gratitude to who
[4449.16 --> 4449.96]  the father is.
[4450.60 --> 4450.70]  Right?
[4450.80 --> 4451.44]  Even his
[4451.44 --> 4452.86]  obedience is a
[4452.86 --> 4453.12]  burden.
[4454.04 --> 4454.72]  There's no life
[4454.72 --> 4455.18]  in him,
[4455.32 --> 4456.36]  just slavish
[4456.36 --> 4457.18]  obedience,
[4457.38 --> 4458.18]  just a rote
[4458.18 --> 4459.18]  morality,
[4459.48 --> 4459.94]  just a
[4459.94 --> 4461.20]  religiosity.
[4462.16 --> 4462.58]  You're starting
[4462.58 --> 4463.72]  to see where
[4463.72 --> 4464.24]  this goes.
[4465.24 --> 4465.80]  For the older
[4465.80 --> 4466.16]  brother,
[4466.26 --> 4466.88]  the relationship
[4466.88 --> 4467.64]  to the father
[4467.64 --> 4468.86]  isn't full of
[4468.86 --> 4469.24]  life,
[4469.32 --> 4469.96]  it's just
[4469.96 --> 4471.70]  more death.
[4471.70 --> 4475.30]  For the
[4475.30 --> 4475.86]  older brother,
[4475.94 --> 4476.36]  the father
[4476.36 --> 4477.28]  may as well
[4477.28 --> 4477.84]  be dead
[4477.84 --> 4479.12]  because there's
[4479.12 --> 4479.94]  no vitality,
[4480.44 --> 4480.96]  there's no
[4480.96 --> 4482.20]  life in their
[4482.20 --> 4482.72]  relationship.
[4484.32 --> 4485.12]  For most of
[4485.12 --> 4486.16]  us here this
[4486.16 --> 4486.50]  morning,
[4487.28 --> 4489.62]  this is the
[4489.62 --> 4491.52]  danger that
[4491.52 --> 4492.00]  we face.
[4492.60 --> 4493.36]  This is the
[4493.36 --> 4494.12]  danger that the
[4494.12 --> 4494.66]  parable is
[4494.66 --> 4495.34]  warning us
[4495.34 --> 4496.04]  about.
[4496.96 --> 4498.32]  The Pharisees
[4498.32 --> 4499.66]  Jesus is
[4499.66 --> 4500.50]  talking to
[4500.50 --> 4501.28]  are the
[4501.28 --> 4501.90]  older brother.
[4502.82 --> 4503.28]  And most
[4503.28 --> 4503.96]  of us,
[4504.02 --> 4504.30]  and I want
[4504.30 --> 4504.64]  to assume
[4504.64 --> 4505.20]  all of us,
[4505.26 --> 4505.98]  but as I
[4505.98 --> 4506.34]  look out,
[4506.46 --> 4507.36]  most of us
[4507.36 --> 4507.90]  here this
[4507.90 --> 4508.44]  morning have
[4508.44 --> 4509.42]  been Christian
[4509.42 --> 4510.56]  for a long
[4510.56 --> 4511.44]  time.
[4511.62 --> 4512.14]  And if that's
[4512.14 --> 4512.44]  true,
[4512.80 --> 4514.06]  we are in
[4514.06 --> 4514.84]  danger of
[4514.84 --> 4515.40]  being or
[4515.40 --> 4516.08]  becoming the
[4516.08 --> 4516.66]  older brother.
[4517.66 --> 4518.18]  Is your
[4518.18 --> 4519.08]  relationship to
[4519.08 --> 4519.54]  the father
[4519.54 --> 4520.24]  more about
[4520.24 --> 4520.72]  slavish
[4520.72 --> 4521.82]  obedience than
[4521.82 --> 4522.46]  it is about
[4522.46 --> 4523.62]  vitality?
[4524.08 --> 4524.20]  Now,
[4524.92 --> 4525.88]  don't hear what
[4525.88 --> 4526.48]  I'm not saying.
[4527.16 --> 4527.78]  Obedience is
[4527.78 --> 4528.24]  important.
[4530.30 --> 4530.94]  But,
[4532.26 --> 4533.80]  obedience is
[4533.80 --> 4534.52]  a consequence
[4534.52 --> 4535.64]  of God being
[4535.64 --> 4536.86]  alive in you
[4536.86 --> 4537.78]  and through
[4537.78 --> 4538.10]  you.
[4539.00 --> 4539.32]  For the
[4539.32 --> 4540.08]  older brother,
[4540.40 --> 4540.98]  he was
[4540.98 --> 4541.74]  obedient because
[4541.74 --> 4542.66]  he thought that
[4542.66 --> 4543.36]  would make his
[4543.36 --> 4544.76]  father give him
[4544.76 --> 4545.22]  something.
[4546.94 --> 4547.80]  Obedience for
[4547.80 --> 4548.60]  the sake of
[4548.60 --> 4549.40]  getting something
[4549.40 --> 4549.90]  from the
[4549.90 --> 4550.32]  father,
[4550.68 --> 4551.38]  that's the
[4551.38 --> 4552.40]  presumption of
[4552.40 --> 4553.12]  religiosity.
[4554.06 --> 4555.20]  If I do the
[4555.20 --> 4555.76]  right thing,
[4555.92 --> 4556.66]  God will bless
[4556.66 --> 4556.90]  me.
[4556.90 --> 4558.06]  If I obey,
[4558.28 --> 4559.10]  God will hear
[4559.10 --> 4560.18]  me and answer
[4560.18 --> 4560.74]  my prayer.
[4562.12 --> 4562.26]  So,
[4562.32 --> 4562.90]  think about it.
[4563.48 --> 4564.08]  Here are some
[4564.08 --> 4565.36]  questions to
[4565.36 --> 4566.32]  ask yourself
[4566.32 --> 4568.06]  to see if you
[4568.06 --> 4569.16]  approach your
[4569.16 --> 4569.80]  religion,
[4570.36 --> 4571.22]  your relationship
[4571.22 --> 4571.86]  to God,
[4571.92 --> 4572.76]  more like the
[4572.76 --> 4573.26]  older brother.
[4574.22 --> 4574.78]  Here's a series
[4574.78 --> 4575.24]  of questions.
[4577.10 --> 4577.50]  If,
[4578.50 --> 4579.84]  whenever you
[4579.84 --> 4580.20]  pray,
[4580.98 --> 4582.20]  you have to
[4582.20 --> 4582.72]  start with
[4582.72 --> 4583.48]  confession,
[4583.48 --> 4583.54]  confession,
[4584.32 --> 4586.38]  you might be
[4586.38 --> 4586.84]  in the danger
[4586.84 --> 4587.38]  zone of the
[4587.38 --> 4587.84]  older brother.
[4589.60 --> 4590.34]  And why do I
[4590.34 --> 4590.74]  say that?
[4593.00 --> 4594.02]  Because maybe
[4594.02 --> 4596.08]  what you believe
[4596.08 --> 4596.76]  in your heart
[4596.76 --> 4598.04]  is that God
[4598.04 --> 4598.94]  won't listen to
[4598.94 --> 4599.72]  you or he
[4599.72 --> 4600.44]  won't hear you
[4600.44 --> 4601.12]  unless you are
[4601.12 --> 4602.46]  clean and holy.
[4603.34 --> 4604.46]  Maybe you think
[4604.46 --> 4605.30]  that you need to
[4605.30 --> 4605.92]  clean up your
[4605.92 --> 4606.62]  stuff, you need
[4606.62 --> 4607.50]  to get it
[4607.50 --> 4608.36]  together before
[4608.36 --> 4609.02]  God will come
[4609.02 --> 4609.44]  to you.
[4609.44 --> 4610.86]  And what
[4610.86 --> 4611.30]  that begins
[4611.30 --> 4611.98]  to reveal
[4611.98 --> 4613.34]  is that your
[4613.34 --> 4614.36]  idea of
[4614.36 --> 4615.30]  religion and
[4615.30 --> 4616.40]  relationship to
[4616.40 --> 4617.22]  God is
[4617.22 --> 4618.58]  ultimately about
[4618.58 --> 4619.40]  morality,
[4620.28 --> 4621.66]  about what
[4621.66 --> 4622.20]  you do,
[4622.28 --> 4622.76]  and you must
[4622.76 --> 4623.36]  do the right
[4623.36 --> 4623.94]  things in order
[4623.94 --> 4624.50]  for God to
[4624.50 --> 4625.58]  come to you.
[4626.82 --> 4627.50]  Here's another
[4627.50 --> 4628.70]  question or
[4628.70 --> 4629.16]  scenario.
[4629.56 --> 4631.22]  If you get
[4631.22 --> 4631.88]  angry,
[4633.28 --> 4633.76]  and like
[4633.76 --> 4635.50]  actually angry,
[4635.76 --> 4636.60]  right, at the
[4636.60 --> 4637.50]  non-Christian
[4637.50 --> 4638.54]  people on your
[4638.54 --> 4639.22]  job site,
[4639.44 --> 4639.92]  or that you
[4639.92 --> 4640.60]  work with,
[4640.78 --> 4641.46]  because of the
[4641.46 --> 4642.06]  language that
[4642.06 --> 4642.70]  they use,
[4643.52 --> 4643.88]  but you've
[4643.88 --> 4644.40]  never actually
[4644.40 --> 4645.02]  felt the need
[4645.02 --> 4645.52]  to talk to
[4645.52 --> 4645.80]  them about
[4645.80 --> 4646.42]  the gospel of
[4646.42 --> 4646.72]  Jesus,
[4647.60 --> 4648.58]  you might be
[4648.58 --> 4649.08]  in the older
[4649.08 --> 4649.66]  brother danger
[4649.66 --> 4649.98]  zone.
[4651.22 --> 4651.80]  Think about it
[4651.80 --> 4652.36]  again, right?
[4652.46 --> 4653.32]  Outward moral
[4653.32 --> 4654.26]  obedience has
[4654.26 --> 4654.92]  become more
[4654.92 --> 4655.74]  important than
[4655.74 --> 4657.28]  grace to you.
[4660.36 --> 4661.26]  Here's one more.
[4662.50 --> 4663.24]  If you've ever
[4663.24 --> 4663.94]  thought you
[4663.94 --> 4664.66]  shouldn't have
[4664.66 --> 4665.88]  to suffer or
[4665.88 --> 4667.08]  get sick or
[4667.08 --> 4667.96]  lose your job
[4667.96 --> 4668.98]  because you've
[4668.98 --> 4669.88]  always been a
[4669.88 --> 4670.50]  good person,
[4671.70 --> 4672.90]  you might be in
[4672.90 --> 4673.22]  the older
[4673.22 --> 4673.86]  brother danger
[4673.86 --> 4674.20]  zone.
[4675.16 --> 4675.80]  The idea here
[4675.80 --> 4676.26]  being that
[4676.26 --> 4677.48]  obedience to
[4677.48 --> 4678.20]  God is for
[4678.20 --> 4678.72]  the purpose
[4678.72 --> 4679.32]  ultimately of
[4679.32 --> 4679.74]  putting God
[4679.74 --> 4680.36]  in your debt,
[4680.74 --> 4681.26]  putting God
[4681.26 --> 4681.92]  in your pocket
[4681.92 --> 4682.74]  so that you
[4682.74 --> 4683.24]  can pull him
[4683.24 --> 4683.70]  out when you
[4683.70 --> 4684.18]  need something
[4684.18 --> 4684.46]  and say,
[4684.54 --> 4684.80]  okay, God,
[4684.86 --> 4685.30]  go fix this
[4685.30 --> 4685.60]  problem.
[4686.60 --> 4687.10]  If you've
[4687.10 --> 4687.56]  ever thought
[4687.56 --> 4688.22]  that way or
[4688.22 --> 4689.20]  in your heart
[4689.20 --> 4689.72]  of hearts
[4689.72 --> 4691.00]  believed that,
[4691.68 --> 4692.16]  you might be
[4692.16 --> 4692.60]  in the danger
[4692.60 --> 4693.14]  zone of the
[4693.14 --> 4693.60]  older brother.
[4693.60 --> 4693.64]  brother.
[4695.00 --> 4696.08]  If you only
[4696.08 --> 4696.94]  ever come to
[4696.94 --> 4697.48]  church on
[4697.48 --> 4698.22]  Sunday because
[4698.22 --> 4699.20]  it's what we
[4699.20 --> 4701.00]  do, right,
[4701.02 --> 4701.50]  if you've never
[4701.50 --> 4702.12]  known the love
[4702.12 --> 4702.64]  of God in
[4702.64 --> 4703.32]  worship or in
[4703.32 --> 4704.18]  sacrament, if
[4704.18 --> 4704.54]  you've never
[4704.54 --> 4705.32]  marveled at the
[4705.32 --> 4706.40]  amazing grace of
[4706.40 --> 4707.44]  Jesus, if it's
[4707.44 --> 4708.88]  only because it's
[4708.88 --> 4709.70]  what's expected
[4709.70 --> 4710.84]  of you, you
[4710.84 --> 4711.96]  might be in the
[4711.96 --> 4712.66]  older brother
[4712.66 --> 4713.88]  danger zone.
[4714.78 --> 4715.62]  Again, if you
[4715.62 --> 4716.36]  get angry or
[4716.36 --> 4717.22]  jealous when
[4717.22 --> 4717.82]  others are
[4717.82 --> 4719.12]  experiencing or
[4719.12 --> 4720.66]  expressing vitality
[4720.66 --> 4721.72]  in their relationship
[4721.72 --> 4722.30]  to God, you
[4722.30 --> 4723.26]  might be in the
[4723.26 --> 4723.80]  older brother
[4723.80 --> 4724.84]  danger zone.
[4725.28 --> 4726.20]  If you're always
[4726.20 --> 4727.14]  suspicious of
[4727.14 --> 4727.94]  other people's
[4727.94 --> 4728.72]  motives, if you
[4728.72 --> 4729.56]  think that other
[4729.56 --> 4730.16]  people are only
[4730.16 --> 4730.82]  ever out for
[4730.82 --> 4731.72]  themselves, you
[4731.72 --> 4732.36]  might be in the
[4732.36 --> 4732.78]  older brother
[4732.78 --> 4733.62]  danger zone,
[4733.72 --> 4733.84]  right?
[4733.92 --> 4734.58]  People who have
[4734.58 --> 4736.04]  genuinely experienced
[4736.04 --> 4737.08]  the grace of God
[4737.08 --> 4739.00]  can not but
[4739.00 --> 4740.16]  offer grace to
[4740.16 --> 4743.06]  others, but also
[4743.06 --> 4744.96]  they can receive
[4744.96 --> 4746.42]  it from others
[4746.42 --> 4747.46]  as well.
[4749.34 --> 4749.88]  We're thinking
[4749.88 --> 4750.66]  about our
[4750.66 --> 4751.90]  spiritual selves
[4751.90 --> 4752.38]  together.
[4752.74 --> 4753.68]  If you are in
[4753.68 --> 4754.34]  the older brother
[4754.34 --> 4755.32]  danger zone, that
[4755.32 --> 4756.20]  means that God
[4756.20 --> 4757.66]  isn't alive to
[4757.66 --> 4759.04]  you, that his
[4759.04 --> 4760.00]  word isn't living
[4760.00 --> 4761.28]  and active in
[4761.28 --> 4762.16]  you, and that
[4762.16 --> 4764.26]  you are stuck in
[4764.26 --> 4766.08]  spiritual deathliness.
[4767.02 --> 4767.76]  Now, let me be
[4767.76 --> 4768.50]  really clear.
[4769.56 --> 4771.38]  I'm not suggesting
[4771.38 --> 4772.80]  we all need to be
[4772.80 --> 4773.98]  happy and clappy
[4773.98 --> 4774.70]  and raising our
[4774.70 --> 4776.48]  hands and emotionally
[4776.48 --> 4777.78]  expressive in our
[4777.78 --> 4778.54]  worship or in
[4778.54 --> 4779.54]  relationship to God.
[4779.54 --> 4779.60]  God.
[4781.48 --> 4782.80]  But he does need to
[4782.80 --> 4783.44]  be real.
[4784.74 --> 4785.54]  He does need to be
[4785.54 --> 4787.98]  alive in you and
[4787.98 --> 4789.14]  to you and through
[4789.14 --> 4789.52]  you.
[4790.00 --> 4792.24]  If he's not, we end
[4792.24 --> 4793.10]  up in the presumption
[4793.10 --> 4794.66]  of religiosity.
[4795.52 --> 4795.62]  Right?
[4795.68 --> 4796.76]  Your faith and your
[4796.76 --> 4797.86]  experience of God
[4797.86 --> 4799.68]  become transactional.
[4800.48 --> 4800.94]  Right?
[4800.98 --> 4801.94]  What can I get out
[4801.94 --> 4802.22]  of it?
[4802.22 --> 4802.66]  Right?
[4803.96 --> 4805.22]  If your faith is
[4805.22 --> 4807.12]  manipulative of God
[4807.12 --> 4809.50]  and of others, then,
[4809.64 --> 4810.12]  and here's where
[4810.12 --> 4811.90]  we'll come back, it's
[4811.90 --> 4813.80]  no wonder young
[4813.80 --> 4815.44]  people and others
[4815.44 --> 4816.76]  don't want anything
[4816.76 --> 4817.42]  to do with that.
[4818.74 --> 4819.52]  Because I don't
[4819.52 --> 4819.84]  either.
[4821.46 --> 4821.58]  Right?
[4821.60 --> 4822.70]  If we don't model
[4822.70 --> 4823.52]  something with
[4823.52 --> 4825.32]  vitality and meaning,
[4825.58 --> 4826.58]  if we don't live as
[4826.58 --> 4827.38]  if this is really
[4827.38 --> 4828.68]  true and really
[4828.68 --> 4829.98]  real, right, if we
[4829.98 --> 4830.54]  don't live with
[4830.54 --> 4831.48]  something deep and
[4831.48 --> 4832.68]  full of substance and
[4832.68 --> 4833.86]  connection to the
[4833.86 --> 4835.36]  transcendence, of
[4835.36 --> 4836.12]  course that's not
[4836.12 --> 4837.80]  caught by those down
[4837.80 --> 4838.84]  the line from us.
[4840.26 --> 4840.40]  Right?
[4840.42 --> 4841.40]  We might actually be
[4841.40 --> 4842.10]  Christian, right?
[4842.14 --> 4842.90]  That is, we might be
[4842.90 --> 4843.78]  marked among the
[4843.78 --> 4845.18]  elect, but you don't
[4845.18 --> 4845.98]  live like it.
[4846.68 --> 4847.44]  You don't know the
[4847.44 --> 4848.68]  joy of being a child
[4848.68 --> 4849.74]  of the father.
[4853.46 --> 4855.30]  And that's the
[4855.30 --> 4856.16]  second thing that the
[4856.16 --> 4857.86]  older brother has
[4857.86 --> 4859.18]  going on or doesn't
[4859.18 --> 4860.44]  have going on.
[4861.38 --> 4862.58]  The first son wants
[4862.58 --> 4863.56]  his father dead.
[4863.78 --> 4864.80]  For the second, the
[4864.80 --> 4865.74]  father's always been
[4865.74 --> 4866.04]  dead.
[4866.16 --> 4867.36]  The first son remembers
[4867.36 --> 4868.88]  the father's mercy.
[4869.08 --> 4870.12]  For the second, he's
[4870.12 --> 4871.48]  forgotten his own
[4871.48 --> 4872.48]  identity.
[4873.98 --> 4874.88]  And maybe this is part
[4874.88 --> 4876.18]  of the root, as I
[4876.18 --> 4877.10]  talked earlier, of
[4877.10 --> 4879.04]  deconstruction in our
[4879.04 --> 4879.28]  age.
[4880.76 --> 4882.38]  Notice what the
[4882.38 --> 4884.06]  older brother says to
[4884.06 --> 4884.46]  the father.
[4885.68 --> 4887.12]  When this son of
[4887.12 --> 4889.26]  yours comes home, you
[4889.26 --> 4890.04]  kill the fattened
[4890.04 --> 4890.60]  calf for him.
[4891.96 --> 4892.48]  Notice first,
[4892.58 --> 4893.58]  this son of yours.
[4893.64 --> 4894.28]  Like, he can't even
[4894.28 --> 4895.34]  say brother.
[4895.48 --> 4896.54]  He can't even address
[4896.54 --> 4897.82]  him as a family
[4897.82 --> 4898.42]  member.
[4898.50 --> 4899.10]  He won't even say
[4899.10 --> 4900.18]  that we are related.
[4900.32 --> 4901.64]  That's the heart of
[4901.64 --> 4902.34]  the older brother.
[4902.48 --> 4904.16]  Refusing to take joy in
[4904.16 --> 4905.44]  the salvation of
[4905.44 --> 4905.72]  others.
[4905.84 --> 4907.04]  Instead, he makes it
[4907.04 --> 4907.60]  about himself.
[4908.88 --> 4910.24]  But notice then what
[4910.24 --> 4911.72]  the father says.
[4911.86 --> 4913.12]  He says, my son.
[4915.34 --> 4916.28]  My son.
[4917.28 --> 4919.28]  You are my son.
[4919.28 --> 4920.54]  This is your brother.
[4920.54 --> 4922.32]  I am your father.
[4922.52 --> 4923.76]  That can't be changed.
[4924.24 --> 4925.16]  I am your father.
[4925.26 --> 4926.12]  Not because you have
[4926.12 --> 4927.52]  earned it, but because I
[4927.52 --> 4928.28]  am your father.
[4928.58 --> 4929.54]  And I am your father.
[4929.64 --> 4930.40]  And I love you.
[4930.48 --> 4931.78]  And I will always love
[4931.78 --> 4931.92]  you.
[4932.18 --> 4933.64]  My son, he says, you are
[4933.64 --> 4935.26]  always with me.
[4935.38 --> 4936.98]  And everything I have
[4936.98 --> 4937.62]  is yours.
[4938.74 --> 4939.64]  Get that, right?
[4939.68 --> 4940.80]  Everything I have is
[4940.80 --> 4940.98]  yours.
[4941.04 --> 4942.04]  That's not just a figure
[4942.04 --> 4943.46]  of speech in this story.
[4943.96 --> 4944.40]  Right?
[4944.40 --> 4945.42]  It's actually true.
[4946.12 --> 4947.08]  Because the father has
[4947.08 --> 4948.58]  already divided out his
[4948.58 --> 4950.12]  inheritance to the
[4950.12 --> 4950.72]  younger brother.
[4950.90 --> 4951.62]  And so literally,
[4951.80 --> 4954.20]  everything left is the
[4954.20 --> 4955.08]  older brother's.
[4956.18 --> 4956.38]  Right?
[4956.44 --> 4957.84]  All I have is yours,
[4958.02 --> 4958.88]  says the father.
[4959.70 --> 4960.86]  The danger zone of the
[4960.86 --> 4961.76]  older brother is to
[4961.76 --> 4964.14]  forget who you are.
[4965.52 --> 4966.72]  If your religion is only
[4966.72 --> 4967.70]  about morality, not
[4967.70 --> 4968.76]  relationship to God, it
[4968.76 --> 4970.34]  is easy to forget that
[4970.34 --> 4972.14]  you are a lavishly loved
[4972.14 --> 4973.88]  child of the father.
[4975.06 --> 4976.06]  Let me put it this way.
[4976.70 --> 4978.88]  The father loves us with
[4978.88 --> 4981.04]  a prodigious love.
[4981.66 --> 4981.74]  Right?
[4981.76 --> 4982.24]  This is about a
[4982.24 --> 4983.88]  prodigal God who runs
[4983.88 --> 4985.86]  out to the lost son when
[4985.86 --> 4987.14]  he returns home and who
[4987.14 --> 4988.72]  goes out to the lost son
[4988.72 --> 4990.00]  who's stuck in the field.
[4991.28 --> 4991.38]  Right?
[4991.44 --> 4992.94]  Prodigal means lavish and
[4992.94 --> 4994.02]  unyielding and over the
[4994.02 --> 4994.32]  top.
[4994.48 --> 4996.12]  That's the God revealed in
[4996.12 --> 4996.68]  this story.
[4996.86 --> 4998.32]  And he is calling you.
[4998.32 --> 5000.50]  He is calling you by name
[5000.50 --> 5002.86]  to experience him maybe
[5002.86 --> 5003.76]  for the first time.
[5004.40 --> 5005.96]  The older brother missed
[5005.96 --> 5006.20]  it.
[5007.34 --> 5008.14]  And in fact, the
[5008.14 --> 5008.96]  compassion that the
[5008.96 --> 5010.28]  father shows makes the
[5010.28 --> 5011.58]  older brother even more
[5011.58 --> 5012.06]  angry.
[5012.66 --> 5012.72]  Right?
[5012.76 --> 5014.44]  It drives him and divides
[5014.44 --> 5015.90]  him from his father and
[5015.90 --> 5016.38]  his brother.
[5016.78 --> 5018.40]  The Pharisees missed it
[5018.40 --> 5020.02]  when they muttered about
[5020.02 --> 5020.46]  Jesus.
[5021.74 --> 5023.04]  Don't you miss it too?
[5026.04 --> 5027.44]  Again, let me be clear.
[5027.44 --> 5030.62]  Maybe you're deconstructing
[5030.62 --> 5031.38]  right now.
[5031.38 --> 5032.36]  Or maybe someone in your
[5032.36 --> 5033.72]  life is deconstructing
[5033.72 --> 5034.44]  right now.
[5035.76 --> 5036.96]  I'm not afraid of your
[5036.96 --> 5037.42]  questions.
[5038.66 --> 5040.52]  We can't be afraid of
[5040.52 --> 5041.94]  hard questions.
[5042.66 --> 5042.76]  Right?
[5042.78 --> 5043.78]  If you've got questions,
[5043.86 --> 5044.48]  let's ask them.
[5044.54 --> 5045.68]  Let's wrestle together.
[5045.98 --> 5047.26]  Let's dig deep into the
[5047.26 --> 5048.42]  truth of who we are and
[5048.42 --> 5049.82]  who God says he is.
[5049.96 --> 5050.90]  And instead of
[5050.90 --> 5052.40]  deconstructing out of the
[5052.40 --> 5053.32]  faith, maybe what we can
[5053.32 --> 5054.88]  do is differentiate within
[5054.88 --> 5055.62]  the faith so that it
[5055.62 --> 5057.06]  becomes your own and it
[5057.06 --> 5057.86]  means more to you.
[5057.94 --> 5059.02]  Let's make our shared
[5059.02 --> 5061.08]  faith your faith.
[5062.84 --> 5064.74]  And then finally, and
[5064.74 --> 5066.90]  here's the last thing to
[5066.90 --> 5068.76]  see from this story.
[5069.20 --> 5070.50]  If your Bibles are open,
[5071.98 --> 5073.66]  zoom out from our parable
[5073.66 --> 5074.74]  to the whole of chapter
[5074.74 --> 5075.78]  15.
[5076.16 --> 5076.30]  Right?
[5076.34 --> 5077.08]  I said at the beginning
[5077.08 --> 5078.36]  that Jesus tells three
[5078.36 --> 5080.28]  stories in this section.
[5080.44 --> 5082.38]  The first story is the
[5082.38 --> 5084.68]  parable of the lost sheep.
[5084.68 --> 5086.86]  You have a sheep who is
[5086.86 --> 5088.48]  lost and the shepherd goes
[5088.48 --> 5089.54]  out to search for that
[5089.54 --> 5090.72]  one lost sheep and he
[5090.72 --> 5092.76]  leaves behind the 99 in
[5092.76 --> 5093.78]  order to go find the one.
[5094.24 --> 5095.44]  The second is about a
[5095.44 --> 5097.24]  woman who loses a coin and
[5097.24 --> 5098.38]  she's lost the coin so she
[5098.38 --> 5100.12]  stops everything she's
[5100.12 --> 5101.34]  doing and she searches the
[5101.34 --> 5103.04]  entire house until she
[5103.04 --> 5104.36]  finds that coin.
[5105.08 --> 5106.34]  The third story is our
[5106.34 --> 5107.82]  story, the father and his
[5107.82 --> 5108.30]  two sons.
[5108.66 --> 5110.00]  And as we quickly recap
[5110.00 --> 5110.98]  those stories, what's the
[5110.98 --> 5111.90]  difference between story
[5111.90 --> 5113.34]  one and two and story
[5113.34 --> 5113.64]  three?
[5113.64 --> 5115.28]  Did you see it?
[5116.88 --> 5117.06]  Right?
[5117.08 --> 5118.10]  In the first two stories,
[5118.48 --> 5120.48]  someone goes out to search.
[5121.16 --> 5122.42]  Someone goes out to find.
[5122.48 --> 5123.38]  The shepherd goes to find
[5123.38 --> 5123.90]  the lost sheep.
[5123.98 --> 5124.78]  The woman stops everything
[5124.78 --> 5126.18]  she does until she finds
[5126.18 --> 5127.28]  that coin she lost.
[5127.34 --> 5128.40]  They go to search what was
[5128.40 --> 5128.96]  for lost.
[5129.50 --> 5130.24]  What was lost.
[5130.72 --> 5132.34]  The third story, no one
[5132.34 --> 5132.82]  goes out.
[5134.66 --> 5135.50]  Why is that?
[5136.58 --> 5137.64]  That makes me wonder.
[5137.64 --> 5144.98]  Now, especially after two
[5144.98 --> 5147.86]  stories of searching to find,
[5148.56 --> 5150.36]  the Pharisees listening to
[5150.36 --> 5152.44]  this story would know
[5152.44 --> 5154.22]  something about the culture
[5154.22 --> 5155.54]  of the day that we would
[5155.54 --> 5156.84]  easily miss.
[5156.92 --> 5158.04]  Something that 2,000 years
[5158.04 --> 5160.28]  later we don't understand.
[5160.42 --> 5161.38]  Because you see, in that
[5161.38 --> 5162.94]  culture there would be an
[5162.94 --> 5165.22]  expectation, a familial
[5165.22 --> 5166.18]  expectation.
[5166.18 --> 5167.68]  The Pharisees listening would
[5167.68 --> 5169.54]  know that it is actually the
[5169.54 --> 5172.10]  older brother's job to go out
[5172.10 --> 5173.40]  and to find his younger
[5173.40 --> 5174.74]  brother wherever he may be
[5174.74 --> 5175.90]  and bring him back to the
[5175.90 --> 5176.18]  father.
[5177.18 --> 5178.82]  The older brother should have
[5178.82 --> 5180.94]  gone out searching to find
[5180.94 --> 5182.18]  his brother and to reconcile
[5182.18 --> 5183.40]  him to the father.
[5183.48 --> 5184.86]  And this goes all the way back
[5184.86 --> 5185.98]  to Cain and Abel.
[5186.82 --> 5187.00]  Right?
[5187.00 --> 5188.62]  When God asks Cain, another
[5188.62 --> 5190.20]  older brother in the Bible,
[5190.30 --> 5191.42]  what has happened to Abel,
[5191.80 --> 5193.44]  Cain says, am I my brother's
[5193.44 --> 5193.66]  keeper?
[5194.64 --> 5195.72]  And the inference in that
[5195.72 --> 5196.52]  story is yes.
[5197.04 --> 5197.72]  Yes, you are.
[5198.12 --> 5199.02]  You are supposed to look
[5199.02 --> 5199.52]  after him.
[5199.78 --> 5201.04]  The older brother should have
[5201.04 --> 5202.20]  gone out to find the younger
[5202.20 --> 5202.48]  brother.
[5202.80 --> 5203.98]  And the people listening to
[5203.98 --> 5205.10]  this story would have
[5205.10 --> 5206.50]  expected that to happen.
[5207.40 --> 5208.08]  But he doesn't.
[5210.28 --> 5211.58]  You see, I believe that Jesus
[5211.58 --> 5213.74]  is teaching us something about
[5213.74 --> 5215.58]  himself in this moment.
[5215.58 --> 5217.56]  Because the older brother
[5217.56 --> 5218.34]  doesn't go out.
[5218.68 --> 5220.36]  Jesus in the story is
[5220.36 --> 5222.46]  creating a longing for a
[5222.46 --> 5223.44]  brother who does.
[5224.54 --> 5224.66]  Right?
[5224.70 --> 5225.68]  You see it now, right?
[5225.74 --> 5227.88]  Jesus is the true and better
[5227.88 --> 5230.14]  older brother who reconciles
[5230.14 --> 5231.90]  us to the father who goes out
[5231.90 --> 5233.92]  to find those who are lost.
[5234.74 --> 5235.76]  And we can actually take this
[5235.76 --> 5237.08]  parable even further in this
[5237.08 --> 5237.34]  regard.
[5237.68 --> 5239.58]  When the brother comes home,
[5240.18 --> 5241.78]  right, and they celebrate,
[5241.90 --> 5243.28]  they clothe him, the father
[5243.28 --> 5244.62]  says to the older brother,
[5244.82 --> 5245.56]  right, all I know is
[5245.56 --> 5246.56]  what I have is yours.
[5247.26 --> 5248.20]  That means everything that
[5248.20 --> 5250.14]  belongs to him is actually
[5250.14 --> 5251.10]  the older brother's.
[5251.88 --> 5252.86]  And when the younger brother
[5252.86 --> 5253.90]  comes home, what does the
[5253.90 --> 5254.38]  father do?
[5255.32 --> 5257.46]  He clothes him in a robe and
[5257.46 --> 5258.98]  gives him a ring.
[5259.32 --> 5260.58]  If everything belongs to the
[5260.58 --> 5262.32]  older brother, who is the
[5262.32 --> 5263.34]  father clothing the younger
[5263.34 --> 5264.36]  brothers in?
[5266.06 --> 5267.08]  The older brother.
[5267.64 --> 5267.82]  Right?
[5267.84 --> 5268.64]  The brother who should have
[5268.64 --> 5269.08]  gone out.
[5269.30 --> 5269.86]  And so what are we learning?
[5269.96 --> 5271.86]  The true and better older
[5271.86 --> 5275.48]  brother clothes us in his
[5275.48 --> 5276.36]  righteousness.
[5277.30 --> 5277.40]  Right?
[5277.44 --> 5279.28]  The father clothes us in
[5279.28 --> 5280.50]  Jesus' righteousness.
[5280.64 --> 5282.12]  The father covers you over
[5282.12 --> 5283.34]  with his obedience.
[5283.72 --> 5284.88]  And with the ring of his
[5284.88 --> 5287.26]  sonship, he restores you as a
[5287.26 --> 5289.38]  lavishly loved son or daughter.
[5289.54 --> 5290.90]  Jesus, the true and better
[5290.90 --> 5292.70]  older brother, gives up his
[5292.70 --> 5295.00]  life so that you may have it.
[5295.08 --> 5297.20]  He empties himself so that you
[5297.20 --> 5298.26]  may be filled up.
[5298.26 --> 5301.32]  He dies so that you may live.
[5302.86 --> 5304.66]  Jesus lives the life I should
[5304.66 --> 5306.46]  have lived and he clothes me
[5306.46 --> 5307.86]  with his righteousness.
[5308.04 --> 5309.42]  And Jesus dies the death that
[5309.42 --> 5311.28]  that I deserve because of sin.
[5311.72 --> 5312.62]  That's the gospel.
[5313.06 --> 5314.56]  That's the parable of the two
[5314.56 --> 5316.42]  lost sons and the prodigal God.
[5316.78 --> 5318.64]  That's real Christianity.
[5319.90 --> 5322.72]  That's gospel life now lived for
[5322.72 --> 5322.90]  me.
[5323.06 --> 5325.34]  When I was dead, he made me
[5325.34 --> 5325.78]  alive.
[5325.86 --> 5327.26]  When I treated the father as
[5327.26 --> 5328.96]  though he was dead to me, he
[5328.96 --> 5330.48]  drew me to himself.
[5330.70 --> 5331.88]  When I rejected, when I
[5331.88 --> 5333.56]  forgot, when I ignored my
[5333.56 --> 5335.88]  identity in him, he came to
[5335.88 --> 5336.96]  remind me.
[5337.28 --> 5339.46]  He came to find me.
[5339.80 --> 5344.46]  And so you see, that's why I
[5344.46 --> 5345.52]  live.
[5345.64 --> 5348.08]  That's why you can live now.
[5348.18 --> 5349.66]  That's why we obey.
[5349.96 --> 5351.24]  That's why we trust.
[5351.36 --> 5352.66]  That's why we can have joy,
[5352.80 --> 5353.92]  whatever the circumstances.
[5354.34 --> 5355.46]  That's why we don't have to
[5355.46 --> 5355.90]  worry.
[5355.90 --> 5357.66]  As Jesus says, that's why I
[5357.66 --> 5360.38]  can have true life now.
[5360.50 --> 5362.84]  Because of Jesus, the true and
[5362.84 --> 5365.92]  better older brother, you can
[5365.92 --> 5366.98]  live.
[5368.48 --> 5371.72]  The Christian life, because of
[5371.72 --> 5373.54]  Jesus as the true and better
[5373.54 --> 5375.38]  older brother, no longer looks
[5375.38 --> 5379.08]  like anger, but joy at the
[5379.08 --> 5380.54]  salvation of others.
[5380.84 --> 5382.26]  The Christian life, because of
[5382.26 --> 5383.26]  Jesus, the true and better
[5383.26 --> 5385.10]  older brother, isn't mired in
[5385.10 --> 5386.20]  guilt and shame.
[5386.28 --> 5388.26]  No matter how great your guilt
[5388.26 --> 5390.90]  is, no matter how big and real
[5390.90 --> 5393.52]  your shame is, you are set free
[5393.52 --> 5396.64]  to be beautiful in the image of
[5396.64 --> 5398.14]  Jesus Christ, the Son, and to
[5398.14 --> 5400.74]  reflect the glory of God in you
[5400.74 --> 5401.76]  and through you.
[5401.90 --> 5403.54]  The Christian life isn't about
[5403.54 --> 5405.44]  rote or empty ritual.
[5405.66 --> 5406.96]  It isn't about the presumption of
[5406.96 --> 5409.32]  religiosity, but about meaningfully
[5409.32 --> 5411.46]  encountering a living God who
[5411.46 --> 5414.00]  breathes new life into every
[5414.00 --> 5416.88]  moment of every day for you.
[5418.44 --> 5420.68]  The Christian life will have
[5420.68 --> 5422.76]  trials and tribulations, will have
[5422.76 --> 5424.44]  challenges and contests, but
[5424.44 --> 5427.50]  because of who Jesus is, you have
[5427.50 --> 5429.06]  already overcome.
[5430.12 --> 5431.68]  Jesus doesn't promise to take away
[5431.68 --> 5433.58]  the trial, but he does promise to
[5433.58 --> 5434.76]  carry you through.
[5434.76 --> 5438.20]  The Father is drawing you to
[5438.20 --> 5440.42]  himself today with a prodigious
[5440.42 --> 5443.64]  grace, with a lavish love, with a
[5443.64 --> 5445.86]  prodigal compassion, and the true
[5445.86 --> 5448.68]  and better older brother finds you.
[5450.32 --> 5452.88]  And together then, Father, Son, and
[5452.88 --> 5454.94]  Holy Spirit, you are being
[5454.94 --> 5457.68]  transformed into the image of his
[5457.68 --> 5460.86]  Son from one degree of glory to
[5460.86 --> 5461.18]  another.
[5461.18 --> 5464.70]  not for slavish obedience, but for
[5464.70 --> 5466.62]  joyful gratitude.
[5467.36 --> 5470.04]  This is real life.
[5470.32 --> 5472.36]  This is real living.
[5472.62 --> 5476.34]  And I pray that today it's made real
[5476.34 --> 5477.32]  for you.
[5477.84 --> 5478.06]  Amen?
[5478.96 --> 5480.00]  Let's pray together.
[5484.84 --> 5489.80]  Lord our God, be real to us.
[5489.80 --> 5494.84]  Be real to us now as we have heard
[5494.84 --> 5497.74]  you revealed in your word.
[5497.88 --> 5500.92]  May it now also be made true in a
[5500.92 --> 5503.26]  way that we can taste and see as we
[5503.26 --> 5504.24]  come to the table.
[5505.52 --> 5508.26]  Be made real to us as we meet you
[5508.26 --> 5511.36]  here in the bread and in the wine.
[5512.70 --> 5515.16]  Be real to us as we celebrate your
[5515.16 --> 5516.74]  feast together.
[5517.20 --> 5519.26]  In Jesus' name, amen.
[5519.80 --> 5520.42]  Amen.
[5525.48 --> 5528.08]  We're going to come to the table of our
[5528.08 --> 5529.60]  good God together.
[5530.50 --> 5534.10]  And this table, even in this sort of
[5534.10 --> 5539.82]  simplified and ritualistic form, is the
[5539.82 --> 5543.44]  celebration of the Son returned to the
[5543.44 --> 5543.74]  Father.
[5544.20 --> 5545.84]  This is the celebration of the
[5545.84 --> 5548.36]  kingdom of heaven for all who believe.
[5548.36 --> 5554.42]  And so we come to this table as sons and daughters called by God to meet him here.
[5554.58 --> 5558.12]  As we come to the table, we will work through a bit of a liturgy together.
[5558.48 --> 5562.28]  I invite you to speak the words that are yours on the screen overhead.
[5563.44 --> 5564.62]  Lift up your hearts.
[5567.58 --> 5570.32]  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
[5574.42 --> 5575.38]  Let's pray together.
[5575.38 --> 5580.38]  With joy, we praise you, gracious God.
[5581.66 --> 5583.30]  For you have created heaven and earth.
[5583.42 --> 5587.76]  You have made us in your image and kept covenant with us even when we fell into sin.
[5588.54 --> 5593.32]  We give you thanks for Jesus Christ, who, by his life, death, and resurrection,
[5593.82 --> 5596.38]  opened to us the way of life everlasting.
[5597.90 --> 5598.18]  Amen.
[5598.18 --> 5608.82]  Jesus, before he suffered, gave us this memorial of his sacrifice until he comes again.
[5609.90 --> 5613.82]  The Lord Jesus, on the night that he was betrayed, took bread.
[5614.44 --> 5617.00]  And when he had given thanks, he broke it and he said,
[5617.00 --> 5620.26]  This is my body, which is for you.
[5621.10 --> 5623.72]  Do this in remembrance of me.
[5625.28 --> 5629.56]  Now, in the same way, he took the cup after supper and said,
[5630.00 --> 5632.88]  This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[5633.64 --> 5636.64]  Do this in remembrance of me.
[5636.64 --> 5642.06]  For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup,
[5642.20 --> 5646.44]  you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes again.
[5647.74 --> 5651.20]  This is the mystery of our faith.
[5651.20 --> 5664.08]  Glory to you, Lord Jesus.
[5665.56 --> 5670.72]  Church family, the Lord has prepared his table for all who love him,
[5670.86 --> 5673.76]  for all who trust in him alone for their salvation.
[5674.70 --> 5679.22]  And so, come to this table, you who have much faith,
[5679.22 --> 5681.14]  and you who would like to have more.
[5681.92 --> 5684.32]  You who have been to this sacrament often,
[5684.52 --> 5686.88]  and you who have not been for a long time.
[5687.24 --> 5691.00]  You who have tried to follow Jesus, and you who have failed.
[5691.68 --> 5695.96]  Come to this table because Jesus is raised.
[5696.32 --> 5699.60]  Come if you are here or if you are at home and online.
[5700.00 --> 5704.82]  Come because it is Christ who invites us to meet him here.
[5705.66 --> 5710.72]  These are the gifts of God for the people of God.
[5712.16 --> 5713.92]  As we come to the table together,
[5714.52 --> 5717.84]  we're going to be ushered up to the front.
[5717.96 --> 5719.56]  We will gather in a circle here,
[5719.64 --> 5722.12]  and we'll move line by line through the church.
[5722.92 --> 5726.18]  An usher will encourage you or invite you to come to the front.
[5726.18 --> 5730.56]  As you come up, we will pass trays of bread around the circle.
[5730.56 --> 5732.80]  As you pass that tray, I invite you to say,
[5732.94 --> 5734.58]  the body of Christ given for you.
[5734.78 --> 5737.88]  We will take the bread, and then we will pass the trays of juice.
[5738.70 --> 5740.62]  As you pass the tray, I invite you to say,
[5740.70 --> 5743.40]  the blood of Christ shed for you.
[5743.40 --> 5749.98]  And then we will return the cup to the table here and back to your seat,
[5750.08 --> 5751.84]  and then the next row will come through.
[5751.90 --> 5753.14]  We will move through in that way.
[5753.48 --> 5756.72]  I'd like to invite the worship leaders and the elders who are serving
[5756.72 --> 5758.22]  to come up for the first table
[5758.22 --> 5762.40]  so that they might then facilitate table for the rest of us.
[5762.40 --> 5767.82]  If you are unable to come up to the front,
[5767.90 --> 5769.24]  but would still like to participate,
[5769.48 --> 5771.36]  please indicate that to one of the ushers,
[5771.74 --> 5773.96]  and we have particular trays here.
[5774.12 --> 5776.04]  They will serve you in your seats.
[5788.60 --> 5791.96]  Christ, Lord, the body of Christ.
[5792.40 --> 5805.96]  Christ, Lord, the body of Christ.
[5805.96 --> 5806.26]  Amen.
[5806.26 --> 5806.30]  Amen.
[5822.40 --> 5826.50]  Amen.
[5840.66 --> 5844.70]  Amen.
[5849.42 --> 5851.76]  Amen.
[5851.76 --> 5881.74]  Thank you.
[5881.76 --> 5911.74]  Thank you.
[5911.76 --> 5913.76]  Thank you.
[5913.76 --> 5917.76]  Drink and believe.
[5941.76 --> 5943.76]  Thank you.
[5943.76 --> 5945.76]  Thank you.
[5945.76 --> 5947.76]  Thank you.
[5947.76 --> 5949.76]  Thank you.
[5949.76 --> 5951.76]  Thank you.
[5951.76 --> 5953.76]  Thank you.
[5953.76 --> 5955.76]  Thank you.
[5955.76 --> 5957.76]  Thank you.
[5957.76 --> 5959.76]  Thank you.
[5959.76 --> 5961.76]  Thank you.
[5961.76 --> 5963.76]  Thank you.
[5963.76 --> 5965.76]  Thank you.
[5965.76 --> 5967.76]  Thank you.
[5967.76 --> 5969.76]  Thank you.
[5969.76 --> 5971.76]  Thank you.
[5971.76 --> 5973.76]  Thank you.
[5973.76 --> 5975.76]  Thank you.
[5975.76 --> 5977.76]  Thank you.
[5977.76 --> 5979.76]  Thank you.
[5979.76 --> 5981.76]  Thank you.
[5981.76 --> 5983.76]  Thank you.
[5983.76 --> 5985.76]  Thank you.
[5985.76 --> 5987.76]  Thank you.
[5987.76 --> 5989.76]  Thank you.
[5989.76 --> 5998.64]  That all who come in faith find forgiveness at the cross.
[5998.64 --> 6005.08]  So we share in this bread of life.
[6005.46 --> 6010.64]  And we drink of his sacrifice.
[6011.48 --> 6018.42]  As a sign of our bonds of peace.
[6018.42 --> 6022.50]  Around the table of the king.
[6033.72 --> 6039.60]  The body of our Savior Jesus Christ.
[6039.90 --> 6041.92]  Torn for you.
[6043.92 --> 6046.34]  He then remembered.
[6046.34 --> 6052.28]  The wounds that heal the death that brings us life.
[6052.68 --> 6057.54]  Pay the price to make us one.
[6058.94 --> 6065.14]  So we share in this bread of life.
[6065.14 --> 6071.42]  And we drink of his sacrifice.
[6071.42 --> 6078.76]  As a sign of our bonds of love.
[6078.76 --> 6083.30]  Around the table of the king.
[6083.30 --> 6102.82]  The blood that cleanses every stain of sin shed for you.
[6102.82 --> 6106.82]  Drink and remember.
[6106.82 --> 6113.76]  He drained us cup that all may enter it.
[6113.76 --> 6119.70]  To receive the life of God.
[6119.70 --> 6126.90]  So we share in this bread of life.
[6126.90 --> 6133.26]  And we drink of his sacrifice.
[6133.26 --> 6140.26]  As a sign of our bonds of faith.
[6140.26 --> 6145.26]  Around the table of the king.
[6145.26 --> 6164.70]  And so with thankfulness and faith we rise to respond.
[6164.70 --> 6166.70]  And to remember.
[6166.70 --> 6169.70]  And to remember.
[6169.70 --> 6176.26]  Our call to follow in the steps of Christ.
[6176.26 --> 6182.52]  As his body here on earth.
[6182.52 --> 6188.52]  As we share in his suffering.
[6188.52 --> 6190.52]  We proclaim.
[6190.52 --> 6194.52]  Christ will come again.
[6194.52 --> 6197.52]  And we'll join.
[6197.52 --> 6202.52]  In the feast of death.
[6202.52 --> 6203.52]  In the feast of death.
[6203.52 --> 6205.52]  And we'll join in that prayer.
[6205.52 --> 6207.52]  To be with the disciples and the asiatic creation.
[6207.52 --> 6211.62]  To be with us and daily God.
[6212.52 --> 6213.94]  I ask the thad.
[6214.44 --> 6218.46]  And we'll beat you.
[6218.52 --> 6225.50]  To be with us and daily God.
[6225.52 --> 6232.50]  Psalm 12 in the main 500.
[6232.50 --> 6254.80]  My Lord, what love is this
[6254.80 --> 6261.30]  That cares so dearly
[6261.30 --> 6268.42]  That all the guilty are
[6268.42 --> 6274.38]  May go free
[6274.38 --> 6280.56]  Of his love, oh what sacrifice
[6280.56 --> 6287.18]  The Son of God, give it for me
[6287.18 --> 6290.98]  My death he claims
[6290.98 --> 6294.64]  And my death he dies
[6294.64 --> 6300.38]  That I might live
[6300.38 --> 6307.84]  That I might live
[6307.84 --> 6317.38]  And so they watch tonight
[6317.38 --> 6323.18]  Despised, rejected
[6323.18 --> 6330.38]  But all the mighty share
[6330.38 --> 6336.50]  Vote for me
[6336.50 --> 6343.62]  Amazing love, oh what sacrifice
[6343.62 --> 6349.50]  The Son of God, give it for me
[6349.50 --> 6353.30]  My death he claims
[6353.30 --> 6357.30]  And my death he dies
[6357.30 --> 6363.30]  That I might live
[6363.30 --> 6368.62]  That I might live
[6368.62 --> 6375.74]  And now
[6375.74 --> 6381.46]  This love of Christ
[6381.46 --> 6383.20]  Shall blow
[6383.20 --> 6387.74]  Like rivers
[6387.74 --> 6394.74]  Come wash your guilt away
[6394.74 --> 6400.74]  Live again
[6400.74 --> 6406.86]  Amazing love, oh what sacrifice
[6406.86 --> 6408.74]  Provide
[6408.74 --> 6413.98]  The Son of God, give it for me
[6413.98 --> 6417.78]  My death he claims
[6417.78 --> 6418.66]  My death he claims
[6418.66 --> 6421.78]  And my death he dies
[6421.78 --> 6427.78]  That I might live
[6427.78 --> 6435.10]  That I might live
[6435.10 --> 6437.90]  Amazing love
