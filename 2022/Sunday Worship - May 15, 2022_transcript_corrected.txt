[0.00 → 7.00] In the vapour of your breath the planets form
[7.00 → 14.00] And if the stars were made to worship so alive
[14.00 → 21.00] I can see your heart in everything you made
[23.00 → 29.00] Every burning star signal fire and grace
[29.00 → 36.00] If creation sings your praises so alive
[50.00 → 54.00] God of your promise
[54.00 → 61.00] You don't speak in vain, no syllable empties your voice
[61.00 → 68.00] For once you have spoken
[68.00 → 71.00] On nature and science
[71.00 → 76.00] Follow the sound of your voice
[76.00 → 83.00] And as you speak
[83.00 → 89.00] A hundred billion creatures catch your breath
[89.00 → 98.00] Evolving in pursuit of what you said
[98.00 → 105.00] And if it all reveals your nature so alive
[105.00 → 111.00] I can see your heart in everything you say
[111.00 → 116.00] Every pain is God
[116.00 → 120.00] A canvas of your grace
[120.00 → 126.00] If creation still obeys you so alive
[126.00 → 127.00] So alive
[127.00 → 133.00] So alive
[133.00 → 139.00] So alive
[139.00 → 146.00] So alive
[146.00 → 152.00] So alive
[152.00 → 160.22] If the stars are made to worship so alive
[160.22 → 167.88] If the mountains bow the reverence so alive
[167.88 → 175.36] If the oceans roar your greatness so will I
[175.36 → 184.66] For if everything exists to lift you high so will I
[184.66 → 190.20] And if the wind goes away you send it so alive
[190.20 → 197.78] If the rocks cry out in silence so will I
[197.78 → 207.08] If the sun of all our praises still fall shy
[207.08 → 214.08] Then we'll sing it a hundred billion times
[214.08 → 226.38] God of salvation chased down my heart through all of my failure and pride
[226.38 → 233.38] God of salvation chased down my heart through all of my failure and pride
[233.38 → 248.74] On a hill you created the light of the world abandoned in darkness to die
[248.74 → 254.80] The light of the world abandoned in darkness to die
[254.80 → 262.04] And as you speak
[262.04 → 268.60] A hundred billion failures disappear
[268.60 → 277.12] We lost your life so I could find it here
[277.12 → 284.26] If you left the grave behind you so alive
[284.26 → 291.08] I could see your heart in everything you've done
[291.08 → 299.58] Every part designed in a work of art called love
[299.58 → 306.72] If you gladly chose surrender so will I
[306.72 → 308.72] If you gladly chose surrender so will I
[308.72 → 313.56] I could see your heart and fill you a different way
[313.56 → 322.64] Every precious one or child you died to save
[322.64 → 329.06] If you gave your life to love them so alive
[329.06 → 337.50] Like you would again a hundred billion times
[337.50 → 344.46] But what measure could amount to your desire
[344.46 → 351.28] You're the one who never leaves the one behind
[352.64 → 358.40] quantities are set to you
[373.78 → 376.92] All this pain
[377.86 → 382.34] I wonder if I'll ever find my way
[382.64 → 391.30] I wonder if my life could really change at all
[391.30 → 400.54] All this earth
[400.54 → 406.32] Could all that is lost ever be found?
[406.32 → 412.22] Could a garden come up from this ground?
[412.64 → 419.64] Could a garden come up from this ground?
[419.64 → 423.64] You make beautiful things
[423.64 → 427.64] You make beautiful things
[427.64 → 431.64] Out of the dust
[431.64 → 435.64] You make beautiful things
[435.64 → 442.64] You make beautiful things out of us
[442.64 → 449.64] You make beautiful things
[449.64 → 453.64] All around
[453.64 → 459.64] Hope is springing up from this old ground
[459.64 → 461.64] Out of chaos
[461.64 → 466.64] Life is being found in me
[466.64 → 473.64] You make beautiful things
[473.64 → 475.64] You make beautiful things
[475.64 → 477.64] You make beautiful things

[529.64 → 530.64] Out of the dust
[530.64 → 532.64] Out of the dust
[532.64 → 546.88] You make me new
[546.88 → 552.56] You are making me new
[552.56 → 558.54] You make me new
[558.54 → 566.54] You are making me new

[654.54 → 656.54] I want to increase my heart
[656.54 → 658.54] I want to increase my heart

[662.54 → 664.54] I want to increase my heart
[664.54 → 666.54] I want to increase my heart
[666.54 → 682.78] There's a peace I've come to know
[682.78 → 689.28] Though my heart and flesh may fail
[689.28 → 694.74] There's an anchor for my soul
[694.74 → 701.28] I can say it is well
[701.28 → 705.94] Jesus has overcome
[705.94 → 712.46] And the grave is overwhelmed
[712.46 → 718.76] The victory is won
[718.76 → 721.40] He is risen
[724.74 → 727.00] Good morning
[727.00 → 731.00] Welcome to church
[731.00 → 734.46] Special welcome if you are visiting with us this morning
[734.46 → 735.28] My name is Chris
[735.28 → 736.88] I'm one of the pastors here
[736.88 → 739.62] And it's my privilege along with these others
[739.62 → 744.94] And some more yet to lead us in our shared worship this morning
[745.28 → 746.80] Each week as we come together
[746.80 → 750.10] We've got a couple announcements that we want to put in front of you
[750.10 → 751.02] And remind you of
[751.02 → 752.52] And, so I'm going to ask Kevin to come up
[752.52 → 754.86] And as he makes his way up
[754.86 → 758.42] I will say that there is pastors class after service today
[758.42 → 761.56] And so if you are thinking about profession of faith
[761.56 → 764.44] Or if you are thinking about church and life
[764.44 → 767.22] That's a place to come and engage in those conversations
[767.22 → 769.82] You can grab me after the service
[769.82 → 771.36] If you want to ask questions about that
[771.36 → 774.10] Otherwise for those who are in the class
[774.10 → 776.48] We will meet in the multipurpose room
[776.48 → 778.78] After you grab a coffee and chat a little bit
[778.78 → 780.36] And then head over there
[780.36 → 784.86] I got a phone call this morning from Wendy Culverts
[784.86 → 785.62] Who wanted to
[785.62 → 786.42] She's in the nursery
[786.42 → 788.32] So she was unable to make this announcement
[788.32 → 789.76] So sorry you get me now
[789.76 → 792.84] Wanted to remind all of you
[792.84 → 794.82] That on Saturday, May 28th
[794.82 → 797.90] We are finally having a welcome to the DeW inters party
[797.90 → 799.64] Two years later
[799.64 → 801.84] Obviously pandemic related
[801.84 → 804.36] We were unable to do something big and fun and festive
[804.36 → 805.30] And so we are doing that
[805.30 → 806.60] Not this coming Saturday
[806.60 → 807.84] But the following Saturday
[807.84 → 809.96] There are a lot of details in the bulletin for that
[809.96 → 812.36] We are going to be meeting at City Park
[812.36 → 814.16] And Al Anderson Pool for that
[814.16 → 817.60] Please check the bulletin for more information
[817.60 → 820.28] But what we are looking for is for people to sing up
[820.28 → 821.98] So there's going to be a barbecue there
[821.98 → 823.72] We're going to feed you burgers and hot dogs
[823.72 → 825.84] But if only eight people sign up
[825.84 → 828.34] And then 80 of you come
[828.34 → 829.92] That's going to be a problem for food
[829.92 → 831.66] So please talk to Dolores
[831.66 → 832.38] I saw Dolores
[832.38 → 833.14] She's right here
[833.14 → 833.90] There's Dolores
[833.90 → 835.64] Wendy Albert's in the nursery
[835.64 → 837.50] So you can flood her right now if you want
[837.50 → 838.82] Just let her know
[838.82 → 840.64] Or Dolores know that you're coming to that
[840.64 → 841.76] And that would be very helpful
[841.76 → 844.36] Also this coming week
[844.36 → 845.42] If you are a kid
[845.42 → 846.72] Or a parent of a kid
[846.72 → 848.22] Who's aged three to seven
[848.22 → 849.56] We are going to be hosting
[849.56 → 851.64] A kids camp here at this church
[851.64 → 853.04] In the summer
[853.04 → 854.82] So from July 10th to 15th
[854.82 → 855.58] That will be happening
[855.58 → 856.36] I say we
[856.36 → 857.60] But it's Carolyn Spoor
[857.60 → 858.46] And Samara Using
[858.46 → 859.18] I don't know if they're there
[859.18 → 860.06] They'll wave if they are
[860.06 → 861.36] I don't see them
[861.36 → 862.88] But they're here somewhere
[862.88 → 864.34] In spirit at the very least
[864.34 → 865.74] They're going to be hosting this kids camp
[865.74 → 866.92] Sign up for that
[866.92 → 867.76] And registration for that
[867.76 → 868.70] Will be coming out this week
[868.70 → 869.60] We're going to be inviting
[869.60 → 870.52] Our community as well
[870.52 → 871.78] So if that's something
[871.78 → 872.56] That you are around
[872.56 → 873.18] And interested in
[873.18 → 874.00] Please keep your eyes
[874.00 → 875.14] On the bulletin
[875.14 → 876.90] And midweek memo this week
[876.90 → 877.78] For that information
[877.78 → 878.46] Thanks
[878.46 → 881.30] So we're clear
[881.30 → 882.28] This wasn't supposed to be
[882.28 → 883.48] A surprise party was it
[883.48 → 884.26] Okay
[884.26 → 892.96] Yeah I mean
[892.96 → 894.26] How do I follow that announcement
[894.26 → 894.90] That'll be fun
[894.90 → 896.78] Hopefully we'll see you on the 28th
[897.38 → 898.68] Hopefully the weather
[898.68 → 899.32] Will be nicer
[899.32 → 900.58] And sunnier
[900.58 → 901.40] And warmer
[901.40 → 902.58] Than it has been lately

[918.66 → 921.00] Maybe take a posture of receipt
[921.00 → 923.42] Because God is welcoming you
[923.42 → 925.28] Into his presence
[925.28 → 927.92] And so receive from him
[927.92 → 929.26] His greeting

[1479.48 → 1489.48] Almighty, holy, and perfect God, we lift you up this morning in our worship, because
[1489.48 → 1492.48] only you are worthy of praise.
[1492.48 → 1496.48] You are the creator of all things good.
[1496.48 → 1503.48] You are the first and the last, the God of the Old Testament and the God of the New Testament.
[1503.48 → 1507.48] Beside you, there is no other God.
[1507.48 → 1513.48] Yet, Lord, we confess that often we worship the wrong things in our lives.
[1513.48 → 1516.48] We can worship money and success.
[1516.48 → 1519.48] We can worship our possessions.
[1519.48 → 1524.48] We can rob you of our time in devotion and service to you.
[1524.48 → 1530.48] Lord, you know all of our sins and failings, no matter how hard we try to hide them from
[1530.48 → 1533.48] others or even ourselves.
[1533.48 → 1539.48] We confess that each of us have stumbled and sinned and fall short of your glory.
[1539.48 → 1543.48] Lord, please forgive us.
[1543.48 → 1554.48] We thank you, dear Jesus, our Saviour, your sacrifice on the cross for the atonement you made for our sins.
[1554.48 → 1558.48] We thank you for your grace through which we are forgiven.
[1558.48 → 1566.48] Holy Spirit, help us to live our lives devoted to you and forever thankful for the cross.

[1654.08 → 1659.36] Has sent us free
[1659.36 → 1671.36] Besides our heart in me
[1671.36 → 1680.26] Mercy and grace are mine
[1680.26 → 1684.26] It is my sin
[1684.26 → 1689.98] Jesus my only hope
[1689.98 → 1694.26] Spirit of all
[1694.26 → 1699.48] Great is the Lord

[1831.96 → 1835.96] Without bottom or shore

[1843.96 → 1846.86] Praise the Lord
[1846.86 → 1848.86] Praise the Lord

[1878.76 → 1881.00] He does He most
[1881.00 → 1881.76] He knows he is more
[1881.76 → 1885.76] What father so tender
[1885.76 → 1887.76] His glory is more
[1887.76 → 1891.76] He will come the weakest
[1891.76 → 1893.76] From my wish to more
[1893.76 → 1898.76] Our sins they are many

[1921.94 → 1924.86] The sins they are heavy
[1924.86 → 1927.80] His mercy is more
[1927.80 → 1935.04] In riches of kindness
[1935.04 → 1937.82] He lavished on us
[1937.82 → 1940.82] His blood was all damaged
[1940.82 → 1943.62] His life was not tossed
[1943.62 → 1946.92] They sued me the deathly
[1946.92 → 1950.88] In the wrath of God
[1950.88 → 1953.82] Our sins they are heavy
[1953.82 → 1956.88] His mercy is more
[1956.88 → 1961.12] Praise the Lord
[1961.12 → 1965.90] His mercy is more
[1965.90 → 1972.38] Stronger than darkness
[1972.38 → 1975.30] New every morning
[1975.30 → 1978.16] For sins they are heavy
[1978.16 → 1981.48] His mercy is more

[1983.32 → 1985.32] New every morning
[1985.32 → 1987.54] His mercy is more
[1987.54 → 1990.78] Since they are heavy
[1990.78 → 1994.72] His mercy is more
[1994.72 → 1997.62] I invite you to be seated

[2382.14 → 2390.86] And I
[2390.86 → 2397.98] I'm lost without you
[2397.98 → 2398.98] I'm lost without you
[2398.98 → 2417.82] All right, kids.
[2417.86 → 2422.48] If you are age three up to grade four, come on up for Kids Corner.
[2428.98 → 2437.48] All right.
[2438.68 → 2446.30] So, this morning up here, I want to talk about a very, very wonderful, wonderful thing called sleep.
[2446.84 → 2448.88] Who here likes it when they have to go to bed?
[2449.44 → 2450.56] Who's excited to go to bed?
[2451.64 → 2453.28] Kirby, a few of you are excited to go to bed.
[2453.34 → 2455.22] You are very smart, very smart kids.
[2456.06 → 2457.64] Who's not excited to go to bed?
[2457.64 → 2464.46] Who stalls and is like, oh, I need a drink of water, and now I have to go to the bathroom and I forgot to give my mom a hug.
[2464.70 → 2465.86] Yeah, some of you do that.
[2466.84 → 2467.02] Yeah.
[2467.62 → 2470.12] What do you guys think of when you think of sleep?
[2470.20 → 2471.66] What words come to your mind?
[2472.30 → 2472.52] Zoe?
[2474.04 → 2474.44] Dreaming?
[2474.76 → 2475.28] What else?
[2475.86 → 2476.12] Some more.
[2476.66 → 2476.98] Sorry.
[2477.88 → 2478.24] Tired?
[2479.36 → 2479.60] Yep.
[2480.82 → 2481.58] Can you say it louder?
[2482.72 → 2483.12] Nightmares.
[2485.62 → 2485.98] Cozy?
[2485.98 → 2488.28] Maybe like pillows and blankets.
[2488.64 → 2492.38] Well, Zoe, you actually mentioned what I want to talk about and that's dreaming.
[2492.56 → 2494.48] Sometimes when we sleep, we have dreams.
[2494.58 → 2495.86] Does anyone here have dreams?
[2496.84 → 2499.38] Some people, maybe you remember them, or maybe you don't.
[2500.08 → 2501.84] Sometimes dreams can be very weird.
[2501.98 → 2507.30] So, I'm going to tell you about my dream that I just had, and you can tell me if you think this is very realistic.
[2507.30 → 2511.38] So, in my dream, I was in Buckingham Palace.
[2512.02 → 2513.72] That's where the Queen of England lives.
[2513.72 → 2518.30] And I could see the whole palace and I thought I was myself.
[2518.50 → 2520.92] But then I realized I wasn't actually a person.
[2521.24 → 2522.32] I was a dog.
[2522.72 → 2524.94] Because the Queen has little dogs called corgis.
[2525.30 → 2527.42] And so, I was a dog, but I had my own head.
[2527.88 → 2529.68] So, it was like my head on dog's body.
[2529.68 → 2534.86] And I was, my job was to go around and sniff out rats in the palace.
[2534.94 → 2535.62] That was my job.
[2536.22 → 2537.94] And I was, I think I was doing a good job.
[2538.66 → 2542.58] And then all of a sudden, I went into a different room and it was a water slide.
[2542.58 → 2546.80] And I went like zipping down this water slide and like flying off.
[2546.92 → 2549.12] And then I landed on the ground and I looked at my paws.
[2549.40 → 2554.28] And I realized that I had beautiful, long, curly hair, but it was coming out of my paws.
[2558.08 → 2559.68] Is that a kind of weird dream?
[2560.44 → 2560.76] Yeah.
[2561.30 → 2565.40] Well, and the thing about dreams is sometimes they have to do with things that maybe we've done.
[2565.68 → 2567.30] Sometimes they can be just totally weird.
[2567.30 → 2574.72] But this dream kind of made sense to me because Isla and I are reading a book about the Queen and rats that are in the palace.
[2574.80 → 2575.68] So, that kind of made sense.
[2575.76 → 2576.74] And there are dogs in it.
[2576.78 → 2578.82] And we've been talking about going to the water slides.
[2579.24 → 2581.50] And I don't know about the curly hair coming out of my feet.
[2581.56 → 2582.44] That was just strange.
[2582.60 → 2586.18] But we are going to talk about a different dream that happened in the Bible.
[2586.30 → 2588.76] It's at the very end of the Bible today in children's worship.
[2589.16 → 2591.80] And some of it maybe might sound a little bit strange.
[2591.86 → 2593.30] Maybe not as strange as my dream.
[2593.58 → 2597.10] But we're going to talk about what that means and what we can learn about it today.
[2597.30 → 2600.62] So, let's pray together, and then we'll do the blessing before we go.
[2602.32 → 2606.26] Lord Jesus, we thank you for this day that we can learn more about you here at church.
[2606.78 → 2611.72] We thank you for the ways you speak to us through the Bible and through other people.
[2612.32 → 2613.50] Through things like dreams.
[2613.68 → 2617.52] And we just pray that we would have open hearts to learning more about your word today.
[2617.84 → 2618.12] Amen.
[2619.34 → 2619.80] All right.
[2619.84 → 2620.34] Let's stand.
[2627.30 → 2629.48] The Lord be with you.
[2629.48 → 2659.46] Thank you.
[2659.48 → 2669.48] Thank you.
[2669.48 → 2677.94] My name is Rob and unlike what it says on the screen, I'm not actually a serving elder, unless
[2677.94 → 2685.64] you're younger than me, and I'm playing tennis with you or something like that.
[2685.64 → 2689.64] I have a question for you to start off with.
[2689.64 → 2694.64] Who was the prime minister in 1929?
[2694.64 → 2698.64] Hmm.
[2698.64 → 2703.64] I don't...
[2703.64 → 2705.64] Mackenzie King.
[2705.64 → 2706.64] Yes.
[2706.64 → 2709.64] Thank you, Dave.
[2709.64 → 2713.64] Let me be a little more specific.
[2713.64 → 2716.64] May 15, 1929.
[2716.64 → 2720.64] What happened on that day?
[2720.64 → 2727.64] Do I have that right, Jerry?
[2727.64 → 2732.64] Happy birthday to Jerry Jansen.
[2732.64 → 2733.64] Thank you.
[2733.64 → 2734.64] Thank you.
[2734.64 → 2735.64] Thank you.
[2735.64 → 2737.64] Thank you.
[2737.64 → 2742.64] I did do the math.
[2742.64 → 2747.64] We are 145 years between the two of us today.
[2747.64 → 2757.64] As well, I understand on Friday we had a wedding with Shana and James.
[2757.64 → 2762.64] I trust that went off without a hitch, although I guess that kind of was the point.
[2762.64 → 2768.64] As well, I see we have Rachel and Adam with us.
[2768.64 → 2769.64] It's great to see you.
[2769.64 → 2771.64] I don't see Brad.
[2771.64 → 2775.64] Did you bring Brad along this morning?
[2775.64 → 2782.64] I don't care what you do after church, but please ask Rachel and Adam about Brad.
[2782.64 → 2792.64] As well, in our family prayer, we'll remember Janet Boat, who just moved to Lacombe.
[2792.64 → 2802.64] And I understand she is settling in well, so that's good, with her many family members in Lacombe.
[2802.64 → 2807.64] And we'd also like to remember John and Wendy Whitaker, former members here.
[2807.64 → 2817.64] Wendy's sister has been diagnosed with very aggressive cancer, and they're asking for prayer.
[2817.64 → 2821.64] Let's come together in prayer.
[2821.64 → 2826.64] God of the Bible, we come to you.
[2826.64 → 2831.64] We're grateful for those words of long ago and long preserved.
[2831.64 → 2835.64] Words of truth, inspired words, inerrant words.
[2835.64 → 2840.64] As Peter mentioned this morning, God of the Old Testament, God of the New Testament.
[2840.64 → 2842.64] We think of the Book of Genesis.
[2842.64 → 2845.64] We read, in the beginning God.
[2845.64 → 2847.64] We can stop right there.
[2847.64 → 2850.64] In the beginning God.
[2850.64 → 2855.64] We read about how you are the creator of the universe, creator of humanity.
[2855.64 → 2860.64] In Genesis we read about the stories of the patriarchs and their stories.
[2860.64 → 2864.64] Dreams, as Nikki was alluding to before.
[2864.64 → 2867.64] Your promises, your faithfulness.
[2867.64 → 2875.64] Thank you for those models of faith that we see from Abraham and the character of Joseph.
[2875.64 → 2879.64] Yet we can also identify with their flaws and their humanity.
[2879.64 → 2885.64] God of the books of Ruth and Esther.
[2885.64 → 2889.64] We love these heartwarming stories of grace and redemption.
[2889.64 → 2893.64] We love to cheer the heroes and boo the villains.
[2893.64 → 2898.64] But better yet, we can identify with our fellow Gentiles and fellow exiles.
[2898.64 → 2902.64] And we can celebrate their inclusion in your covenant.
[2902.64 → 2906.64] And our inclusion in your covenant.
[2906.64 → 2912.64] And in the New Testament, we thank you as the God of the book of Jude.
[2912.64 → 2916.64] We think about the warnings that Jude writes about.
[2916.64 → 2921.64] Where we misuse grace and deny Jesus as Lord.
[2921.64 → 2923.64] Forgive us for doing the same thing.
[2923.64 → 2926.64] 2,000 years later, we still struggle with that.
[2926.64 → 2932.64] Help us to see those tendencies in ourselves and come to you.
[2932.64 → 2934.64] Help us to contend for the faith.
[2934.64 → 2937.64] And that we can do so by living your truth.
[2937.64 → 2938.64] Living in your truth.
[2938.64 → 2942.64] And we pray that you help us to do so in real ways.
[2942.64 → 2944.64] Not just here in the sanctuary.
[2944.64 → 2946.64] But wherever we go from here.
[2946.64 → 2950.64] Lord, we pray that your spirit will guide our beliefs.
[2950.64 → 2955.64] In such a way that our practices will fall into line with our beliefs.
[2955.64 → 2959.64] May we always get back to those words.
[2959.64 → 2961.64] In the beginning, God.
[2961.64 → 2966.64] Father, we thank you for what's going on in this church.
[2966.64 → 2967.64] Things that are happening.
[2967.64 → 2970.64] We thank you for the various ministries that happen here.
[2970.64 → 2973.64] And there's so many people that are involved.
[2973.64 → 2975.64] We pray that we're not just running programs.
[2975.64 → 2980.64] But through that, that we are living out your calling for us.
[2980.64 → 2982.64] That we can gather, grow and go.
[2982.64 → 2984.64] And be balanced in that.
[2984.64 → 2987.64] Father, we pray for Tuesday's council meeting.
[2987.64 → 2991.64] We pray that their discussions as well would be rooted in right belief.
[2991.64 → 2996.64] And that from that, that right actions would become clear and follow.
[2996.64 → 3000.64] We thank you so much for the leadership in our church.
[3000.64 → 3002.64] The influence of our pastors.
[3002.64 → 3004.64] For, for Pastor Chris.
[3004.64 → 3006.64] And for Pastor Kevin.
[3006.64 → 3007.64] And, and for Josh.
[3007.64 → 3011.64] Lord, we thank you for, for their being here.
[3011.64 → 3013.64] And being a part of our church.
[3013.64 → 3016.64] And, and for steering us in the right direction.
[3016.64 → 3018.64] May they be grounded in, in your belief.
[3018.64 → 3023.64] And, and not distracted by, by the responsibilities of their day-to-day tasks.
[3023.64 → 3027.64] Father, we're also grateful for the pastors who have, who've come before.
[3027.64 → 3029.64] We think of Pastor Dan in Fredericton.
[3029.64 → 3032.64] Who taught us to be chaplains in all life.
[3032.64 → 3033.64] And all life.
[3033.64 → 3035.64] We think of Pastor Bill.
[3035.64 → 3037.64] Of whom we still mourn his passing.
[3037.64 → 3041.64] Who taught us the science of Christian living.
[3041.64 → 3043.64] We thank you for Pastor Ed.
[3043.64 → 3044.64] Now in Guelph, Ontario.
[3044.64 → 3047.64] Who taught us a zest for Christian living.
[3047.64 → 3050.64] And we also thank you for Pastor Rob Hendon.
[3050.64 → 3052.64] And now in London.
[3052.64 → 3054.64] Who taught us how to be a church.
[3054.64 → 3056.64] Father, we thank you for them.
[3056.64 → 3058.64] And, and the many faithful members.
[3058.64 → 3060.64] Who have come before us.
[3060.64 → 3062.64] And, and passed the baton to us.
[3062.64 → 3064.64] And we pray that we may carry it faithfully.
[3064.64 → 3070.64] And, and likewise that we can pass that faith on to those who will follow us.
[3070.64 → 3075.64] We think of the number of significant happenings in our congregation.
[3075.64 → 3080.64] Father, we celebrate with, with Shana and James their wedding.
[3080.64 → 3082.64] And, and Adam and Rachel.
[3082.64 → 3085.64] Father, we're grateful to hear of, of Marcus improvement.
[3085.64 → 3087.64] Marcus improved health.
[3087.64 → 3094.64] And we also, we, we mourn the passing of, of the Alexander's father and grandfather.
[3094.64 → 3098.64] Bless them as, as they go through that, that grieving process.
[3098.64 → 3103.64] Father, we're, we're shocked by the, the tragedy in, in Abbotsford.
[3103.64 → 3105.64] Surrounding the young family.
[3105.64 → 3109.64] Lord, we pray that you will bless that family and guide them through this.
[3109.64 → 3113.64] We think too of, of John and Wendy Whitaker.
[3113.64 → 3117.64] As Wendy's, Wendy's, uh, sister dealing with cancer.
[3117.64 → 3120.64] Lord, we pray that you will bless that situation.
[3120.64 → 3128.64] Uh, we also are thankful to hear that Janet is, uh, has been able to move to Lacombe.
[3128.64 → 3131.64] Lord, we pray that she will be a blessing to that community.
[3131.64 → 3133.64] And that they will be a blessing to her.
[3133.64 → 3138.64] Father, these are some tangible things that we know, that we see.
[3138.64 → 3144.64] We pray for those too, that are wrestling with big things that are happening beneath the surface.
[3144.64 → 3149.64] Give them, uh, whatever that may be, or give all of us the courage to start with you.
[3149.64 → 3153.64] To start with that right belief and that our practices may follow.
[3153.64 → 3157.64] Uh, in closing, we, we ask for your prayer.
[3157.64 → 3163.64] We ask for prayer on, uh, blessing this, the message that will come to us from the words of Jude.
[3163.64 → 3166.64] And, and from the voice of Pastor Chris.
[3166.64 → 3168.64] Lord, may our ears be open.
[3168.64 → 3170.64] May our hearts be receptive.
[3170.64 → 3175.64] And may our, uh, actions move us to your will.
[3175.64 → 3176.64] In your name we pray.
[3176.64 → 3177.64] Amen.
[3177.64 → 3178.64] Amen.
[3178.64 → 3179.64] Amen.
[3179.64 → 3207.12] We indeed are going to look at the book of Jude.
[3207.12 → 3213.60] And so, as always, I really encourage you to have a Bible, have that open.
[3213.72 → 3220.62] We're going to read verses 17 through 23 together.
[3230.62 → 3231.18] Okay.
[3233.94 → 3236.44] From the book of Jude, in verse 17.
[3237.12 → 3245.18] But, dear friends, remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ foretold.
[3246.12 → 3246.98] They said to you,
[3246.98 → 3276.98] 
[3276.98 → 3288.62] This is the word of the Lord.
[3288.62 → 3297.36] And to others, show mercy mixed with fear, hating even the clothing stained by corrupted flesh.
[3297.36 → 3300.14] This is the word of the Lord.
[3300.14 → 3308.94] Now, you may have noticed that this morning I'm wearing my funeral jacket.
[3308.94 → 3315.94] And I'm wearing my funeral jacket because we are mourning the end of the hockey season for the Toronto Maple Leafs.
[3315.94 → 3325.62] Now, in all reality, I don't actually care, even though I'm from Ontario.
[3325.62 → 3331.26] But, I bring it up because it's always interesting, right?
[3331.36 → 3337.62] And being surrounded by Leafs fans my entire life, I know this to be true, that when the season ends, right?
[3337.62 → 3341.28] Instead of, you know, there's always next year, or we played our hardest.
[3341.62 → 3343.92] It's always, oh, we got robbed.
[3344.22 → 3345.52] Tavares' goal should have counted.
[3346.72 → 3348.92] Oh, the officials stole that from us.
[3348.92 → 3351.78] When can it be our time?
[3354.58 → 3365.26] And they have to take the lumps in the media and from people like Pastor Kevin and pursue forward.
[3365.68 → 3372.30] Now, you might also notice that I'm wearing my party socks because we're celebrating that the Edmonton Oilers have won.
[3374.50 → 3376.90] That was my only concession to you.
[3376.90 → 3380.88] Having given him that, I will tell you that I destroyed him in golf this week.
[3382.04 → 3385.16] And so, now he's going to have to go back to the drawing board and figure out,
[3385.46 → 3386.38] how am I going to pursue?
[3386.70 → 3387.78] How am I going to get better?
[3388.02 → 3390.58] How am I going to endure the next time we face this challenge?
[3391.68 → 3393.18] There's a point to all this, I promise.
[3396.84 → 3404.26] Sports, athletic contests, are a really great example of what to do when things get hard.
[3404.26 → 3404.66] Right?
[3405.60 → 3411.58] And they're a really great way of teaching kids how to endure in the face of trial and opposition.
[3412.24 → 3412.74] Right?
[3412.82 → 3418.34] Sometimes you have to learn how to overcome tragic defeat.
[3418.68 → 3425.48] Or learn how to overcome 35 years of tragic defeat.
[3425.48 → 3430.36] Or learn how to be a gracious winner when your team wins.
[3435.32 → 3437.44] And sports do that for us.
[3438.04 → 3445.08] And they do that for our kids as we teach them how to face trials and press on.
[3445.20 → 3449.86] How to engage failure and try again.
[3449.92 → 3452.42] Now, there are lots of other things that do that in life.
[3452.42 → 3455.04] So, if you're not a sports person, just pick your thing.
[3455.98 → 3456.16] Right?
[3456.28 → 3459.58] But we learn how to do that.
[3461.38 → 3470.04] I think that is a good starting metaphor for what Jude wants us to see and do in this particular text.
[3470.64 → 3475.04] In the face of trial, in the face of division or deceit or destruction,
[3475.04 → 3481.92] how do you persevere through onto something greater and something bigger?
[3482.66 → 3487.88] Well, we're going to see in this text here from Jude, these few short verses,
[3488.40 → 3493.32] that the church is made up of those who are called, cherished, and kept.
[3493.32 → 3502.72] And yet, there are those who seek to divide and destroy and divert from this identity in Christ.
[3502.72 → 3508.26] But that there is a way for you to persevere in faith and in the faith.
[3508.74 → 3512.70] And you do that by remembering, remaining, and rescuing.
[3513.70 → 3518.84] And so, for those of you who are note takers, there's a real simple three-part outline.
[3518.84 → 3519.16] Right?
[3519.52 → 3521.26] Called, cherished, kept.
[3521.40 → 3522.24] That's part one.
[3522.84 → 3524.52] Divide, destroy, divert.
[3524.68 → 3525.56] That's part two.
[3525.76 → 3530.80] And then part three, where we will land, is remembered, remain, and rescue.
[3532.18 → 3538.02] And so, first, who you are in Jesus.
[3538.52 → 3541.80] Now, this is, of course, an identity question.
[3541.80 → 3554.76] And in our world today, it seems that there is no more important or no more pervasive question or conversation than one's own identity.
[3556.06 → 3556.20] Right?
[3556.34 → 3557.68] Identity politics.
[3558.78 → 3559.84] Sexual identity.
[3560.58 → 3561.64] Gender identity.
[3562.26 → 3566.42] Self-identifying in the midst of all of these things, one way or the other.
[3566.66 → 3568.00] On and on it goes.
[3568.00 → 3576.72] Because identity and identity language seems to be the kind of gospel tongue of the 21st century Western world.
[3578.60 → 3583.18] And of course, to some degree, that makes sense.
[3584.18 → 3584.32] Right?
[3584.48 → 3593.20] Who you say you are, and who you think you are, and who you allow saying something of who you are,
[3593.20 → 3601.14] and who you give permission to speak into the identity that you form and have over you or about you, matters.
[3601.42 → 3603.90] And it comes together to mean something.
[3604.58 → 3613.88] It determines our way of being in the world, our life in the world, our way of seeing the world, and even being seen in the world.
[3613.88 → 3621.16] And of course, from a psychological perspective, from a developmental psychology perspective, right?
[3621.26 → 3624.18] We know that this is standard fare.
[3624.32 → 3633.02] That trying on different identities, especially in the sort of pre-teen, adolescent years, is perfectly normal.
[3633.38 → 3633.48] Right?
[3633.48 → 3639.52] People try all sorts of ways of being in the world until they find the right one.
[3639.62 → 3646.34] A community of like people who feel right, who make a sense of home for us.
[3647.06 → 3651.80] And of course, identity and belonging are closely connected.
[3651.80 → 3665.82] And further, because belonging, or belonging because of a shared identity, is intimately linked to your sense of worth, your self-worth in the world.
[3665.94 → 3670.88] And so, again, of course, people in the world are trying to figure this out.
[3670.88 → 3680.34] Trying to find an identity that fits, that feels right, that fills you with purpose and provides a sense of home, a sense of belonging.
[3680.34 → 3680.66] Right?
[3680.68 → 3684.02] Because we are all looking for that thing.
[3685.62 → 3695.74] Now, I suggest to you, the problem that we face in the world today is that we are told that we must look within to find that identity.
[3696.26 → 3706.08] We are told that we have to become who we truly are meant to be by doing what we love and not doing those things that we don't love or that don't, what's that Marie Kondo thing?
[3706.18 → 3707.80] Spark joy in you.
[3707.80 → 3715.64] Ultimately, we're told that we have to look in our own hearts and our own souls for this kind of identity.
[3716.72 → 3719.14] And of course, again, don't hear what I'm not saying, right?
[3719.18 → 3721.26] People need to individuate.
[3721.40 → 3726.24] We need to differentiate from those around us, from our families of origins, our parents.
[3726.54 → 3730.78] That's an aspect of growing into the person that God has called us to be.
[3730.78 → 3741.14] But the reality here is that if it's up to me to discern, if it's up to me to determine what that might be for myself,
[3742.20 → 3744.62] oh man, I just never figured that out.
[3745.60 → 3746.72] And it's tiring.
[3746.96 → 3747.88] It's impossible.
[3748.46 → 3748.58] Right?
[3748.62 → 3755.62] My heart is fickle and wandering, and I'm easily persuaded of one thing, and then I'm easily persuaded of the next thing.
[3755.62 → 3760.72] And then I'm disappointed, and I'm hurt, and then the cycle begins all over again.
[3762.40 → 3762.94] Right?
[3763.00 → 3764.62] There's nothing that seems to last.
[3765.46 → 3772.90] There's an impermanence that comes with this self-identifying promise spoken in the world today.
[3772.90 → 3779.62] Instead, what I want for you and what I believe that Jude is writing about and grounding us in,
[3779.68 → 3785.74] what I believe that God has for us is a gospel identity that lasts.
[3786.28 → 3792.32] A permanence in who you are because of the absolute permanence of who God is.
[3792.32 → 3797.46] This is the gospel identity that Jude grounds his letter in.
[3798.28 → 3805.48] In his discussion of those who are tempting people with something else, tempting them with an untruth.
[3805.90 → 3813.12] It is this identity that becomes the foundation for how they might persevere in the face of these challenges.
[3813.32 → 3817.10] And so, because you all have Bibles handy or in front of you,
[3817.50 → 3819.32] verse 1, look at verse 1.
[3820.36 → 3820.92] Jude says,
[3820.92 → 3829.82] To those who have been called, who are loved in God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ.
[3832.08 → 3837.78] Called, loved, or cherished is the word I'm using, and kept.
[3838.16 → 3840.04] Called, cherished, and kept.
[3840.52 → 3842.74] That is who you are.
[3843.96 → 3847.76] You have been called by God.
[3847.76 → 3851.44] And in the power of the call of God, right?
[3851.50 → 3855.42] It's not just a voice calling out to you saying,
[3855.76 → 3856.98] Come here, come to me.
[3857.30 → 3857.44] Right?
[3857.44 → 3861.82] It's not just a voice from somewhere off in the distance or somewhere up in heaven saying,
[3862.12 → 3863.20] Come and find me.
[3863.30 → 3866.14] And then saying, No, you have to go and find God.
[3866.22 → 3866.32] Right?
[3866.32 → 3873.76] The power of the call of God is that God's call itself carries you to Him.
[3874.28 → 3874.42] Right?
[3874.42 → 3880.20] God's call carries you into His presence, into relationship with Him.
[3881.80 → 3883.88] And for those of you who pay attention to this sort of thing,
[3883.98 → 3889.54] that's why we begin our worship services with a call to worship.
[3890.62 → 3891.10] Right?
[3891.10 → 3894.66] Because it's not just God saying, Come into my presence and worship me.
[3895.04 → 3895.14] Right?
[3895.26 → 3900.22] It is God saying, Come all who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
[3900.60 → 3903.44] Come all you who are hungry and thirsty.
[3903.62 → 3907.00] Come drink deeply of these living waters.
[3907.18 → 3909.40] Come and have life that you may live.
[3909.58 → 3911.96] It's not just God calling us to come.
[3911.96 → 3917.88] It is God picking us up, our hearts of faith, picking up the souls of our lives and our minds
[3917.88 → 3925.84] and our bodies and drawing us, carrying us into His presence, carrying us into the throne
[3925.84 → 3926.64] of His grace.
[3926.90 → 3928.46] That's God's call.
[3929.98 → 3930.94] You are called.
[3932.20 → 3939.32] You are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's special possession.
[3939.74 → 3941.00] That's who you are.
[3941.00 → 3943.80] That's what it means to be called.
[3945.40 → 3946.52] You are called.
[3947.40 → 3948.58] And you are cherished.
[3949.54 → 3953.00] You are cherished by God the Father.
[3953.98 → 3957.72] You are lavishly loved children of the Creator of the world.
[3958.00 → 3961.08] The One who spoke the world into being.
[3961.42 → 3965.88] The One without whom nothing that is would ever be or could ever be.
[3965.88 → 3970.72] That same God looks at you into your eyes and says,
[3971.00 → 3972.92] I love you.
[3973.80 → 3975.40] I cherish you.
[3975.40 → 3982.72] Some of you know that I'm teaching pastor's class right now.
[3983.60 → 3990.02] Pastor's class is one of those things that we do, and we offer for young people or new
[3990.02 → 3996.32] converts to the faith, people who are returning to the faith after years of absence of way and
[3996.32 → 4000.64] who want to come and profess their faith for the first time or for a renewed time.
[4000.64 → 4004.38] To stand up in front of us as the body of believers and to say,
[4004.38 → 4011.62] I too believe the Lord Jesus as my Saviour and I commit myself with you to live for Him.
[4011.62 → 4017.44] And as part of preparing for that, I teach a class, and we look at some theology.
[4017.60 → 4021.32] What does it mean to believe that, and what does it mean to be reformed and the like?
[4022.10 → 4029.84] Now I start that class with a conversation about doctrine of God, around the doctrine of God.
[4029.84 → 4035.06] And so we're looking at the person, the character, the nature and being of who God is.
[4035.56 → 4041.10] And part of that, I teach on what's called the immutability of God.
[4041.60 → 4043.48] Now, I know that's a fancy word.
[4044.30 → 4045.36] So I'm going to break it down.
[4045.46 → 4046.66] And this is how we do it in the class.
[4046.66 → 4050.76] So I will ask if you know who the X-Men are.
[4052.04 → 4055.22] If you know who the X-Men are, you know what a mutant is.
[4055.32 → 4059.34] Now, this last week when I taught this class, nobody in the class knew who the X-Men are.
[4059.44 → 4060.54] And that's a shame on you parents.
[4062.68 → 4068.24] But one of them did say, I know who the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are.
[4068.78 → 4069.98] And so you parents are redeemed.
[4069.98 → 4077.60] To mutate or to be a mutant, right, is to change from one thing to the other.
[4078.46 → 4081.76] And so immutable, right, is the opposite.
[4082.90 → 4086.06] It is, instead of changing, it is unchanging.
[4086.62 → 4091.78] And so when we say God is immutable, what we mean is that God is unchanging.
[4091.94 → 4093.36] He doesn't mutate.
[4093.36 → 4105.12] And so when God says, I love you, when God says, I cherish you, that never changes because God never changes.
[4105.94 → 4112.70] Because God is immutable, your cherished identity in Him is never ending.
[4112.70 → 4130.04] And as a father of a nine-year-old girl, I want you to hear that.
[4132.56 → 4133.92] I want her to hear that.
[4133.92 → 4143.54] I want us all to hear that, that you are cherished of God your Father with a never ending love.
[4147.98 → 4149.00] And you are kept.
[4150.50 → 4154.34] You are called, you are cherished, and you are kept.
[4155.66 → 4160.00] And to be kept means to never be left alone.
[4160.00 → 4166.82] I don't know if we're still allowed to talk like this, and so forgive me if I cross some sort of woke line.
[4166.94 → 4171.02] But it used to be that you could be a kept man or a kept woman, right?
[4171.06 → 4174.24] And what that meant is you were in a relationship and no one else could have you.
[4175.24 → 4175.36] Right?
[4175.40 → 4180.34] It means to be kept means to belong to my Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.
[4180.44 → 4186.14] To be kept means to be part of the bride of Christ who is the church which is kept for Him, reserved for Him,
[4186.14 → 4189.74] and marked out for glory as His inheritance.
[4189.98 → 4195.86] To be kept is to be the prize for which He died, for which Jesus died.
[4196.10 → 4201.06] To be kept is Jesus saying, I will never leave you nor forsake you.
[4201.14 → 4206.84] To be kept is Jesus saying, surely I am with you always to the very end of the age.
[4207.08 → 4213.54] To be kept is the promise that He who began a good work in you will see it through unto completion.
[4213.54 → 4218.78] This is what it means to be called and cherish and kept.
[4219.32 → 4223.46] And by grace through faith, this identity cannot change.
[4223.92 → 4229.20] It lasts forever precisely because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[4229.54 → 4231.90] You who are in Him cannot be lost.
[4231.90 → 4241.72] This is the foundation of identity that enables you then to persevere, to stand under trial, to last.
[4241.82 → 4241.92] Right?
[4241.98 → 4244.98] In the face of those who are calling you to disobedience.
[4245.16 → 4250.36] In the face of those who are pressuring you to do something that you are not interested in doing,
[4250.44 → 4252.10] that is not who you want to be.
[4252.18 → 4255.68] In the face of those who are asking you to be someone who you are not.
[4255.68 → 4264.04] This identity stands firm because it is an identity granted by God the Father through Jesus the Son made yours
[4264.04 → 4267.52] as you are made His by the Holy Spirit.
[4268.52 → 4276.42] And it is precisely because of this identity, precisely because of what Jesus has done for us in the gospel,
[4276.42 → 4281.72] that Jude says that those who don't understand will slander you.
[4283.22 → 4286.22] That the things that don't understand, they will seek to destroy.
[4287.04 → 4289.74] Now this is where we spent most of our time last week,
[4289.78 → 4291.32] and so I'm not going to spend a lot of time there.
[4291.40 → 4294.14] You can find that online, go to our church website.
[4294.32 → 4300.96] But Jude here is identifying that in the face of this identity and the call to persevere,
[4301.30 → 4303.34] there are those who seek to divide.
[4303.34 → 4305.78] We can see it again in our text, verse 19.
[4306.58 → 4309.28] These are the people who divide you,
[4309.78 → 4313.10] who follow mere natural instincts and do not have the Spirit.
[4313.40 → 4318.42] These are the people who seek to divide and to destroy and to divert your attentions away.
[4319.30 → 4321.78] Division comes from those who say,
[4322.10 → 4324.62] oh, it's no big deal, nobody's getting hurt,
[4324.98 → 4327.78] it doesn't matter if I do this little thing or not.
[4328.84 → 4330.62] Destroying comes from those who say,
[4330.62 → 4332.40] I don't have to follow this rule.
[4332.40 → 4334.60] That law doesn't apply to me anymore.
[4334.84 → 4338.48] I'm glad that works for you, but it's not for me.
[4339.28 → 4340.52] I don't know how many times you hear that.
[4342.38 → 4345.20] And diverting your attention comes from those who say,
[4345.36 → 4347.72] I don't need this religion thing, I don't need this faith thing,
[4347.96 → 4350.16] this gospel thing in order to be good in the world.
[4350.64 → 4352.06] You don't have to bother with that.
[4352.34 → 4353.32] Don't worry about that.
[4353.40 → 4356.10] Instead, look over here, come over here.
[4356.10 → 4361.32] The world is full of people who seek to divide or destroy or divert.
[4363.06 → 4369.50] And even some of our churches are full of people who seek to divide, destroy, and divert.
[4370.22 → 4373.12] People who don't understand and so slander.
[4373.26 → 4375.14] People who grumble and find fault.
[4375.26 → 4379.18] People who boast about themselves and flatter others for their own advantage.
[4379.18 → 4382.66] But that is not who Jude says you are.
[4384.46 → 4388.96] And so this identity of God is both granted and sure and fixed,
[4389.12 → 4393.76] and it is aspirational as we try to live in it and out of it towards it.
[4394.50 → 4397.40] Jude, and through this, right, as God's word,
[4397.74 → 4400.38] as Jesus owns voice for us today,
[4400.38 → 4405.58] God himself then wants something more from us and for us.
[4406.78 → 4414.40] You see, there is a straight line from this gospel identity of being called and cherished and kept.
[4414.66 → 4418.44] A straight line that runs through towards perseverance,
[4418.72 → 4421.60] that runs through trial and to the end of history,
[4421.76 → 4423.72] to the consummation of all that is,
[4423.80 → 4425.90] to the glory of God made manifest in our midst.
[4425.90 → 4432.14] And it's a straight line that runs through remembering, remaining, and rescuing.
[4435.56 → 4437.86] But you, dear friends,
[4439.04 → 4444.50] remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ foretold.
[4446.48 → 4450.54] Remember what the apostles said.
[4451.02 → 4453.10] And then that connects to verse 20.
[4453.10 → 4463.10] Remember what the apostles said.
[4463.96 → 4465.74] Remember the teachings of the apostles.
[4466.10 → 4467.52] Remember the words of Jesus.
[4467.74 → 4469.26] Remember the word of God.
[4469.44 → 4470.10] Remember the scriptures.
[4471.04 → 4475.62] Remembering the scriptures is how you build yourselves up in the most holy faith.
[4475.98 → 4477.10] Remember biblical teaching.
[4477.10 → 4481.22] When people want to divide or destroy or divert,
[4481.54 → 4486.62] it's so easy to forget our identity as called and cherished and kept by God.
[4486.94 → 4489.48] And so we need to remember.
[4490.76 → 4494.42] And remember who you are by reading the word of God.
[4494.84 → 4496.96] And here's the thing.
[4496.96 → 4501.80] When we talk about remembering the word of God,
[4501.86 → 4504.84] when we talk about remembering biblical teaching,
[4505.16 → 4510.12] I want to be really clear because I don't just mean remember in the sense of like call to mind.
[4510.82 → 4511.02] Right?
[4511.02 → 4514.96] I don't just mean remember in the sense of like take that thing that you had sort of forgotten
[4514.96 → 4517.66] that was in the back of your brain and bring it to the front.
[4518.66 → 4518.76] Right?
[4518.76 → 4525.48] Remember in a biblical sense has an almost like sacramental character to it,
[4525.66 → 4530.14] a liturgical character to it, a worshipful character to it.
[4530.92 → 4531.04] Right?
[4531.08 → 4534.62] In fact, remembering has a sort of power to it.
[4535.08 → 4538.10] That's why Jesus himself, when he instituted the Lord's Supper,
[4538.52 → 4539.02] right, he said,
[4539.22 → 4540.74] eat this bread and drink this cup.
[4541.16 → 4544.84] Do this in remembrance of me.
[4544.84 → 4547.86] For whenever we eat this bread and drink this cup,
[4547.90 → 4549.34] we can read in 1 Corinthians,
[4549.66 → 4552.82] you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes again.
[4553.96 → 4557.50] Remembering and remembrance has a sort of power to it,
[4557.54 → 4558.80] a power to transform,
[4559.00 → 4560.32] a power to proclaim,
[4560.46 → 4562.58] a power to remind you of who you are
[4562.58 → 4566.62] and to make you more of who God has called you to be
[4566.62 → 4570.16] as his cherished and kept child.
[4570.16 → 4575.02] And let me be clear,
[4575.16 → 4576.82] because it's important for me not to assume
[4576.82 → 4578.76] what may be an obvious connection
[4578.76 → 4580.98] or perhaps what should be an obvious connection,
[4581.14 → 4585.18] but you can't remember what you don't know.
[4586.40 → 4590.44] Or you can't remember what you don't read.
[4591.32 → 4593.98] You can't remember what you don't hear.
[4594.58 → 4597.28] If you need to remember the voice of Jesus,
[4597.28 → 4599.54] if you need to remember the word of God,
[4599.60 → 4601.24] you need to read the word of God.
[4601.58 → 4603.14] You need to hear the voice of Jesus
[4603.14 → 4605.18] proclaimed boldly and powerfully.
[4605.48 → 4608.72] You need to immerse yourself in the words of Jesus.
[4608.88 → 4610.88] You need to surround yourself with the community
[4610.88 → 4612.84] that speaks the truth of God
[4612.84 → 4615.38] into the everyday struggles of your lives.
[4615.68 → 4617.46] You need the voice of the good shepherd
[4617.46 → 4619.46] spoken to you so often
[4619.46 → 4621.76] that it actually becomes your own voice,
[4621.98 → 4623.88] your own way of speaking in the world,
[4623.96 → 4626.12] that his voice courses through you,
[4626.12 → 4627.70] that your words are his words,
[4627.76 → 4629.36] so that when you speak to me,
[4630.06 → 4631.30] it's Jesus through you.
[4632.24 → 4633.68] And when I speak to you,
[4633.80 → 4635.32] it's Jesus through me,
[4635.38 → 4637.64] that his words naturally flow in you
[4637.64 → 4640.00] and out of you to the world around you.
[4640.72 → 4642.66] Because every single one of you
[4642.66 → 4644.04] will tell me
[4644.04 → 4646.02] that you need to read the Bible more.
[4646.02 → 4650.34] But almost every single one of you
[4650.34 → 4651.04] will tell me
[4651.04 → 4652.48] that it's also hard to feel
[4652.48 → 4655.08] the power of God's declaring identity
[4655.08 → 4656.20] in your life.
[4656.36 → 4657.52] It's hard for that identity
[4657.52 → 4660.02] to infiltrate every aspect of your lives.
[4660.34 → 4660.40] And
[4660.40 → 4663.34] you forget who you are
[4663.34 → 4665.48] because you aren't reading
[4665.48 → 4667.70] or hearing who God says you are.
[4668.98 → 4669.58] Remember
[4669.58 → 4671.84] biblical teaching.
[4671.84 → 4674.26] And then two,
[4674.46 → 4674.88] remain
[4674.88 → 4676.50] in God's love.
[4677.28 → 4678.76] In verse 20 and 21,
[4680.40 → 4681.24] But you, dear friends,
[4681.34 → 4682.44] by building yourselves up
[4682.44 → 4683.64] in your most holy faith,
[4683.82 → 4685.30] remembering the apostles' teaching,
[4685.64 → 4687.46] and by praying in the Holy Spirit,
[4688.04 → 4689.02] keep yourselves,
[4689.20 → 4690.62] or another way to translate that is,
[4690.78 → 4691.30] remain
[4691.30 → 4692.00] in
[4692.00 → 4692.82] God's
[4692.82 → 4693.50] love
[4693.50 → 4695.36] as you wait for the mercy
[4695.36 → 4696.50] of our Lord Jesus Christ
[4696.50 → 4697.34] to bring you
[4697.34 → 4697.86] to
[4697.86 → 4698.94] eternal
[4698.94 → 4699.96] life.
[4699.96 → 4701.10] What does it mean
[4701.10 → 4702.08] to remain
[4702.08 → 4702.96] in
[4702.96 → 4703.96] God's
[4703.96 → 4704.68] love?
[4705.52 → 4706.06] Now,
[4706.08 → 4706.66] on the one hand,
[4707.58 → 4708.14] we know
[4708.14 → 4709.58] from other passages
[4709.58 → 4710.20] in the Bible,
[4710.32 → 4711.16] like 1 John 4
[4711.16 → 4712.36] is a good example of this,
[4712.42 → 4712.58] right?
[4712.96 → 4714.56] If anyone acknowledges
[4714.56 → 4716.18] that Jesus is the Son of God,
[4716.30 → 4717.44] God lives in them
[4717.44 → 4718.58] and they in God,
[4718.68 → 4719.72] and so we know
[4719.72 → 4720.50] and rely
[4720.50 → 4721.24] on the love
[4721.24 → 4722.46] God has for us.
[4722.90 → 4724.00] God is love.
[4724.06 → 4724.66] Whoever lives
[4724.66 → 4725.74] in love
[4725.74 → 4726.68] lives in God,
[4726.68 → 4727.26] and God
[4727.26 → 4728.46] in them.
[4728.62 → 4729.16] We know
[4729.16 → 4730.16] that we remain
[4730.16 → 4731.52] in God's love
[4731.52 → 4732.48] because God,
[4732.66 → 4733.18] by grace,
[4733.40 → 4734.24] keeps us there.
[4735.28 → 4735.72] Right?
[4735.80 → 4736.64] We know
[4736.64 → 4738.18] that He is love
[4738.18 → 4739.10] and that we are
[4739.10 → 4739.78] in Him
[4739.78 → 4740.54] because of whom
[4740.54 → 4741.40] He is.
[4741.48 → 4742.04] And with Paul
[4742.04 → 4743.08] in Romans 8,
[4743.84 → 4744.38] we know
[4744.38 → 4744.90] that,
[4745.06 → 4745.82] for I am convinced
[4745.82 → 4746.52] that neither death
[4746.52 → 4747.04] nor life,
[4747.14 → 4747.60] neither angels
[4747.60 → 4748.04] nor demons,
[4748.18 → 4748.82] neither the present
[4748.82 → 4749.44] nor the future,
[4749.56 → 4750.46] nor any powers,
[4750.90 → 4751.50] nor height,
[4751.60 → 4752.22] nor depth,
[4752.32 → 4753.50] nor anything else
[4753.50 → 4754.58] in all creation
[4754.58 → 4755.68] will be able
[4755.68 → 4757.06] to separate us
[4757.06 → 4758.74] from the love
[4758.74 → 4759.58] of God
[4759.58 → 4760.64] that is in Christ
[4760.64 → 4762.02] Jesus our Lord.
[4763.00 → 4764.14] And so we know
[4764.14 → 4765.34] that we remain
[4765.34 → 4766.26] in God
[4766.26 → 4767.44] because God
[4767.44 → 4769.34] doesn't let go.
[4771.84 → 4772.82] And yet,
[4772.82 → 4778.06] you also
[4778.06 → 4779.98] have a responsibility.
[4781.52 → 4782.22] And let me be clear,
[4782.52 → 4782.62] right?
[4782.98 → 4783.74] Responsibility here
[4783.74 → 4784.86] is the right word
[4784.86 → 4786.64] insofar as it means
[4786.64 → 4788.16] ability to respond.
[4789.20 → 4789.68] Right?
[4789.74 → 4790.78] You don't respond
[4790.78 → 4791.86] to God's love
[4791.86 → 4792.70] in order to keep
[4792.70 → 4793.50] yourself in it
[4793.50 → 4794.20] because He promises
[4794.20 → 4794.94] to keep you.
[4795.28 → 4795.42] Right?
[4795.56 → 4796.40] You are kept
[4796.40 → 4797.42] in God's love
[4797.42 → 4799.00] and so you respond
[4799.00 → 4800.24] in love.
[4800.24 → 4801.80] You respond
[4801.80 → 4802.80] to who God is
[4802.80 → 4803.80] by building yourself
[4803.80 → 4804.84] up in the most
[4804.84 → 4805.46] holy faith,
[4805.54 → 4806.40] by praying
[4806.40 → 4807.52] in the Holy Spirit
[4807.52 → 4808.74] and by waiting
[4808.74 → 4809.92] for the return
[4809.92 → 4810.48] of Jesus
[4810.48 → 4811.64] with a barely
[4811.64 → 4812.98] bridled anticipation.
[4814.12 → 4814.22] Right?
[4814.26 → 4814.98] That's what it means
[4814.98 → 4815.62] to remain
[4815.62 → 4817.08] in God's love,
[4817.20 → 4818.14] to respond
[4818.14 → 4819.78] to His first loving you
[4819.78 → 4820.90] by learning more
[4820.90 → 4821.50] about Him,
[4821.72 → 4822.78] by studying the Scriptures,
[4822.78 → 4823.94] to respond
[4823.94 → 4825.72] to His first calling you
[4825.72 → 4827.34] by calling on Him
[4827.34 → 4827.96] in prayer,
[4827.96 → 4829.10] to respond
[4829.10 → 4830.32] to His first coming
[4830.32 → 4831.40] by waiting
[4831.40 → 4832.70] in anticipation
[4832.70 → 4834.52] for His second coming.
[4835.56 → 4835.68] Right?
[4835.72 → 4837.28] Remain in God's love
[4837.28 → 4838.28] by reading the Scriptures,
[4838.46 → 4839.60] by rejoicing in prayer
[4839.60 → 4840.56] and by waiting
[4840.56 → 4842.18] for His return.
[4843.12 → 4844.18] And according to Jude,
[4845.02 → 4847.90] this is the basic formula
[4847.90 → 4848.74] for developing
[4848.74 → 4850.10] healthy disciples
[4850.10 → 4851.56] grounded in the identity
[4851.56 → 4852.90] of being called
[4852.90 → 4853.62] and cherished
[4853.62 → 4854.28] and kept.
[4854.28 → 4857.94] this is what it takes
[4857.94 → 4860.72] to endure opposition
[4860.72 → 4862.06] or failure
[4862.06 → 4863.52] or another season
[4863.52 → 4864.10] of loss.
[4867.60 → 4868.72] And so,
[4869.14 → 4870.30] we are filled
[4870.30 → 4870.98] with a purpose.
[4872.32 → 4872.94] And finally,
[4874.14 → 4874.64] rescue.
[4876.88 → 4878.30] Rescue those
[4878.30 → 4879.02] who doubt,
[4879.66 → 4880.68] who struggle,
[4881.28 → 4882.50] who are falling away
[4882.50 → 4883.56] and who need to be
[4883.56 → 4884.58] lifted.
[4884.82 → 4885.36] Verse 22,
[4885.56 → 4886.96] Be merciful to those
[4886.96 → 4887.44] who doubt.
[4888.16 → 4888.78] Save others
[4888.78 → 4889.70] by snatching them
[4889.70 → 4890.38] from the fire.
[4890.76 → 4891.20] To others,
[4891.34 → 4892.82] show mercy mixed with fear,
[4892.94 → 4894.34] hating even the clothing
[4894.34 → 4897.28] stained by corrupted flesh.
[4899.62 → 4900.50] Truth is,
[4901.86 → 4904.18] we all struggle.
[4904.98 → 4905.74] Every one of us.
[4906.16 → 4907.10] We all fail.
[4907.52 → 4908.48] We all fall short
[4908.48 → 4909.84] of the glory of God.
[4909.84 → 4911.22] We all forget
[4911.22 → 4912.64] who we are
[4912.64 → 4914.08] in Christ Jesus.
[4914.30 → 4915.92] And we all need help.
[4916.56 → 4917.66] Each one of us
[4917.66 → 4918.42] will doubt.
[4918.76 → 4919.80] You may be doubting
[4919.80 → 4920.46] right now,
[4920.52 → 4921.48] even as you sit here.
[4922.40 → 4923.44] Every one of us
[4923.44 → 4924.26] will slide
[4924.26 → 4925.28] or will disobey
[4925.28 → 4926.58] or will wander away.
[4926.86 → 4928.48] We all need mercy.
[4928.88 → 4930.02] Christians aren't
[4930.02 → 4930.56] the people
[4930.56 → 4931.68] who have it all together.
[4931.92 → 4932.66] Far from it.
[4932.82 → 4933.44] We just might be
[4933.44 → 4934.04] the first people
[4934.04 → 4934.56] to realize
[4934.56 → 4935.12] how broken
[4935.12 → 4936.02] we really are.
[4937.54 → 4938.16] And yes,
[4938.16 → 4940.66] some of us
[4940.66 → 4941.36] pretend
[4941.36 → 4943.04] better than others.
[4944.60 → 4945.52] And yes,
[4946.14 → 4947.32] all of us
[4947.32 → 4948.38] are hypocrites.
[4950.46 → 4951.68] Maybe you left church
[4951.68 → 4952.40] years ago
[4952.40 → 4953.80] because you looked around
[4953.80 → 4955.66] and all you saw
[4955.66 → 4956.66] were hypocrites.
[4958.44 → 4959.40] And you were right.
[4963.76 → 4964.84] And I'm sorry
[4964.84 → 4966.72] for how you may have been
[4966.72 → 4967.48] hurt in the past.
[4968.68 → 4969.46] And I'm sorry
[4969.46 → 4970.14] for how you may
[4970.14 → 4971.06] still be hurting
[4971.06 → 4972.02] now.
[4978.14 → 4979.20] But don't,
[4979.20 → 4982.26] don't be tricked.
[4982.60 → 4983.20] Don't be fooled.
[4983.92 → 4984.28] Don't,
[4984.28 → 4985.04] don't settle
[4985.04 → 4986.14] for letting
[4986.14 → 4987.62] a bad example
[4987.62 → 4988.96] of Jesus
[4988.96 → 4990.80] replace
[4990.80 → 4992.92] the truth
[4992.92 → 4994.28] of Jesus
[4994.28 → 4995.62] in your heart
[4995.62 → 4996.78] and in your mind.
[4998.10 → 4998.60] Like,
[4998.68 → 4999.40] I'm a hypocrite.
[4999.72 → 5000.54] I know that.
[5001.20 → 5002.40] But I also know
[5002.40 → 5003.12] that Jesus
[5003.12 → 5003.82] is perfect.
[5004.40 → 5005.12] That he lived
[5005.12 → 5005.50] the life
[5005.50 → 5006.22] I should have lived.
[5006.30 → 5007.04] That he died
[5007.04 → 5007.46] the death
[5007.46 → 5008.20] that I deserved.
[5008.30 → 5008.92] And so now,
[5009.12 → 5009.54] somehow,
[5010.04 → 5010.76] my sin
[5010.76 → 5011.94] is laid on him
[5011.94 → 5013.04] and his righteousness
[5013.04 → 5014.46] is passed over to me.
[5014.62 → 5015.60] I am a hypocrite
[5015.60 → 5016.36] and yet,
[5016.54 → 5017.64] I am declared
[5017.64 → 5018.44] righteous.
[5018.88 → 5019.94] That's the gospel.
[5019.94 → 5022.00] And while we all
[5022.00 → 5023.26] still may fall
[5023.26 → 5023.94] to hypocrisy,
[5024.64 → 5025.44] we are no longer
[5025.44 → 5026.30] defined
[5026.30 → 5027.18] by that
[5027.18 → 5027.94] failure.
[5030.80 → 5031.96] And yes,
[5032.40 → 5034.04] I will need you
[5034.04 → 5034.90] to rescue
[5034.90 → 5036.00] me.
[5037.32 → 5038.10] And maybe
[5038.10 → 5039.34] this week
[5039.34 → 5039.92] that rescue
[5039.92 → 5041.02] looks like rebuke.
[5042.16 → 5042.92] Maybe
[5042.92 → 5044.08] that rescue
[5044.08 → 5044.82] looks like
[5044.82 → 5045.34] restoration.
[5046.02 → 5047.02] Maybe that rescue
[5047.02 → 5047.70] looks like
[5047.70 → 5048.36] reconciliation.
[5048.94 → 5049.52] But whatever
[5049.52 → 5050.74] form it takes,
[5051.18 → 5052.04] I need
[5052.04 → 5053.10] you to
[5053.10 → 5054.12] rescue me
[5054.12 → 5054.84] at times
[5054.84 → 5055.42] in my life
[5055.42 → 5055.84] and faith.
[5055.92 → 5056.86] Just like you
[5056.86 → 5057.74] will need
[5057.74 → 5058.42] each other.
[5058.96 → 5059.88] And I rely
[5059.88 → 5060.56] on you
[5060.56 → 5061.38] as the hands
[5061.38 → 5061.92] and the feet
[5061.92 → 5062.44] of Jesus
[5062.44 → 5063.36] to show me
[5063.36 → 5063.58] that,
[5063.84 → 5064.58] to provide
[5064.58 → 5065.32] that rescue
[5065.32 → 5065.60] for me
[5065.60 → 5066.42] and to lead
[5066.42 → 5067.42] me back
[5067.42 → 5068.10] to him.
[5071.70 → 5072.38] I know
[5072.38 → 5072.84] that you have
[5072.84 → 5073.30] doubts.
[5074.80 → 5075.44] But know
[5075.44 → 5075.88] that you are
[5075.88 → 5076.68] in good company.
[5078.06 → 5078.48] That this is
[5078.48 → 5078.92] your home.
[5079.52 → 5080.28] I know
[5080.28 → 5080.58] that you have
[5080.58 → 5081.26] questions.
[5081.84 → 5082.32] And while we
[5082.32 → 5083.04] may not have
[5083.04 → 5083.84] all the answers
[5083.84 → 5084.46] here,
[5084.56 → 5085.36] let's dwell
[5085.36 → 5086.64] in the mystery
[5086.64 → 5087.68] together.
[5088.58 → 5089.46] Instead of
[5089.46 → 5090.62] deconstructing
[5090.62 → 5091.30] out of a bad
[5091.30 → 5092.26] example of faith,
[5092.34 → 5093.38] let's reconstruct
[5093.38 → 5094.82] a gospel faith
[5094.82 → 5095.44] together.
[5096.04 → 5096.66] And while we
[5096.66 → 5097.16] are far
[5097.16 → 5098.24] from perfect,
[5098.50 → 5099.42] we are striving
[5099.42 → 5100.78] with unveiled
[5100.78 → 5101.80] faces to be
[5101.80 → 5102.64] transformed from
[5102.64 → 5103.26] one degree
[5103.26 → 5103.90] of glory
[5103.90 → 5104.86] to another.
[5105.86 → 5106.72] You are
[5106.72 → 5107.36] called.
[5107.36 → 5108.24] You are
[5108.24 → 5108.98] cherished.
[5109.34 → 5109.74] You are
[5109.74 → 5110.44] kept.
[5110.74 → 5111.04] And in a
[5111.04 → 5111.60] world that
[5111.60 → 5112.08] seeks to
[5112.08 → 5112.96] divide and
[5112.96 → 5113.72] destroy and
[5113.72 → 5114.46] divert our
[5114.46 → 5115.60] affections for
[5115.60 → 5115.98] Jesus,
[5116.42 → 5117.62] go today
[5117.62 → 5118.56] remembering
[5118.56 → 5120.14] God's truth.
[5120.32 → 5121.06] Go today
[5121.06 → 5122.34] remaining in
[5122.34 → 5123.24] his love by
[5123.24 → 5124.30] building up
[5124.30 → 5124.80] your faith,
[5124.90 → 5125.72] by praying in
[5125.72 → 5126.28] the Holy Spirit
[5126.28 → 5127.42] and by waiting
[5127.42 → 5128.18] for his
[5128.18 → 5128.84] return.
[5129.20 → 5130.06] Go today
[5130.06 → 5130.98] to rescue
[5130.98 → 5132.00] those who
[5132.00 → 5132.66] have forgotten
[5132.66 → 5133.62] or who are
[5133.62 → 5134.02] forgetting.
[5134.02 → 5135.86] Go and live
[5135.86 → 5137.54] this identity
[5137.54 → 5138.64] that lasts
[5138.64 → 5139.56] forever.
[5142.10 → 5143.74] Daughter of
[5143.74 → 5144.18] God,
[5144.98 → 5147.04] you are
[5147.04 → 5148.68] cherished.
[5150.08 → 5151.42] Son of
[5151.42 → 5151.96] God,
[5152.80 → 5154.84] you are
[5154.84 → 5156.64] kept
[5156.64 → 5158.98] forever
[5158.98 → 5161.02] in him.
[5161.02 → 5163.00] and so
[5163.00 → 5163.30] go.
[5164.72 → 5165.40] Live a
[5165.40 → 5165.80] life
[5165.80 → 5167.06] worthy
[5167.06 → 5168.90] of your
[5168.90 → 5169.94] calling.
[5171.72 → 5172.42] Let me
[5172.42 → 5172.76] pray for
[5172.76 → 5172.92] you.
[5178.50 → 5179.72] Holy Spirit,
[5179.98 → 5181.54] fill us
[5181.54 → 5183.12] to overflow
[5183.12 → 5184.26] in with
[5184.26 → 5185.64] your love.
[5185.84 → 5186.26] Transform
[5186.26 → 5187.74] our hearts
[5187.74 → 5188.56] and minds
[5188.56 → 5189.30] today that
[5189.30 → 5189.82] we might
[5189.82 → 5190.42] see the
[5190.42 → 5191.76] truth of
[5191.76 → 5192.38] who we
[5192.38 → 5193.22] are in
[5193.22 → 5193.72] you.
[5193.84 → 5194.38] The truth
[5194.38 → 5195.02] of your
[5195.02 → 5195.70] love for
[5195.70 → 5196.22] us that
[5196.22 → 5197.12] names us
[5197.12 → 5198.20] son and
[5198.20 → 5198.48] daughter.
[5198.60 → 5199.02] The truth
[5199.02 → 5199.58] of the
[5199.58 → 5200.24] spirit of
[5200.24 → 5200.98] adoption by
[5200.98 → 5201.44] which we
[5201.44 → 5201.74] cry,
[5201.96 → 5202.36] Abba,
[5202.72 → 5203.20] Father,
[5203.32 → 5204.10] the truth
[5204.10 → 5204.84] that you
[5204.84 → 5205.48] have called
[5205.48 → 5205.78] us,
[5205.86 → 5206.08] that you
[5206.08 → 5206.58] cherish
[5206.58 → 5207.00] us,

[5215.54 → 5216.52] this truth,
[5217.04 → 5217.90] remaining in
[5217.90 → 5218.58] your love
[5218.58 → 5220.08] to rescue
[5220.08 → 5221.36] one another
[5221.36 → 5222.70] and to
[5222.70 → 5223.16] rescue
[5223.16 → 5223.84] the world
[5223.84 → 5224.70] that you
[5224.70 → 5225.42] have sent
[5225.42 → 5226.42] us out
[5226.42 → 5228.02] into now.
[5229.02 → 5230.62] We go on
[5230.62 → 5231.32] the firm
[5231.32 → 5232.64] foundation of
[5232.64 → 5234.28] Jesus Christ,
[5234.66 → 5235.68] the cornerstone
[5235.68 → 5236.80] of our life
[5236.80 → 5237.86] and faith.
[5239.14 → 5240.30] Go with
[5240.30 → 5241.32] boldness.
[5242.10 → 5242.64] In Jesus
[5242.64 → 5243.42] Christ, we
[5243.42 → 5243.72] pray.
[5244.76 → 5245.12] Amen.
[5245.12 → 5245.22] Amen.
[5247.90 → 5276.14] My home is built
[5276.14 → 5284.72] Are nothing less than Jesus' love in righteousness.
[5286.78 → 5292.72] I dare not trust the sweetest praise.
[5294.30 → 5299.72] God only trusts in Jesus' name.
[5299.72 → 5315.92] I know it's built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[5318.06 → 5324.20] I dare not trust the sweetest praise.
[5324.20 → 5332.18] God only trusts in Jesus' name.
[5333.74 → 5340.52] Christ alone, cornerstone.
[5340.98 → 5347.66] Weak made strong in the Saviour's love.
[5347.66 → 5358.30] Through the storm, He is Lord, Lord of all.
[5358.30 → 5359.74] Weak made strong in the Saviour's love.
[5359.74 → 5360.84] Weak made strong in the Saviour's love.
[5360.84 → 5362.06] Weak made strong in the Saviour's love.
[5362.06 → 5363.46] Weak made strong in the Saviour's love.
[5363.46 → 5369.86] When darkness seems to light it's red.
[5369.86 → 5376.24] The high as the dark is the changing grace.
[5376.24 → 5383.76] In every eye and story there
[5383.76 → 5390.26] My anchor rose within the grave
[5390.26 → 5398.58] My anchor rose within the grave
[5398.58 → 5406.84] Christ alone, cornerstone
[5406.84 → 5413.76] Weak may strong, stead of love
[5413.76 → 5420.68] Through the storm, He is Lord
[5420.68 → 5424.98] Lord of all
[5424.98 → 5436.20] When He shall come with trumpet sound
[5436.20 → 5443.26] O may I then in Him be found
[5443.26 → 5450.16] Dressed in His righteousness alone
[5450.16 → 5458.38] Faultless stand before the Lord
[5458.38 → 5470.38] I shut low, cornerstone
[5470.38 → 5478.60] Weak may strong, stead of love
[5478.60 → 5485.60] Through the storm, He is Lord
[5485.60 → 5489.60] Lord of all
[5489.60 → 5498.82] Christ alone, cornerstone
[5498.82 → 5506.82] Weak may strong, in the Saviour's love
[5506.82 → 5513.82] Through the storm, He is Lord
[5513.82 → 5519.04] Lord of all
[5519.04 → 5545.12] As you go this week to live a life worthy of your calling, know that God Himself goes with you.
[5545.12 → 5554.30] And so receive His blessing, both as a promise and as an assurance that He is by your side.
[5555.34 → 5558.20] God go before you to guide you.
[5558.76 → 5560.96] God go behind you to guard you.
[5561.54 → 5563.40] God go beneath you to support you.
[5563.70 → 5566.10] God go beside you to befriend you.
[5566.10 → 5566.40] God go beneath you to guard you.
[5566.40 → 5568.36] God do not be afraid.
[5569.64 → 5574.52] Remember, you are called, cherish, and kept.
[5575.76 → 5580.80] And so go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
[5581.80 → 5582.48] Amen.

[5594.54 → 5595.54] Amen.
[5596.10 → 5599.08] Amen.
[5626.10 → 5631.30] He gave his prayers and turned my Saviour in.
[5632.76 → 5639.12] Because he lives, I can face tomorrow.
[5639.12 → 5647.64] Because he lives, all fear is gone.
[5648.20 → 5654.62] Because I know he holds a future.
[5654.62 → 5662.62] And life is worth living just because he lives.
[5663.72 → 5670.18] I'll speak to old, a newborn baby.
[5671.30 → 5677.50] And feel the pride and joy begin.
[5677.50 → 5685.50] But greater still, a calm assurance.
[5685.50 → 5690.60] This child can face uncertainties.
[5690.96 → 5692.50] Because he lives.
[5692.50 → 5696.50] Because he lives.
[5696.50 → 5700.60] I can face tomorrow.
[5700.60 → 5704.60] Because he lives.
[5704.60 → 5708.60] Oh, fear is gone.
[5708.60 → 5738.60] 
[5738.60 → 5746.60] And then as death gives way to victory.
[5746.60 → 5750.60] I'll see the lights and glory.
[5750.60 → 5754.60] And I'll know he reigns.
[5754.60 → 5758.60] Because he lives.
[5758.60 → 5760.60] Because he lives.
[5760.60 → 5762.60] I can face tomorrow.
[5762.60 → 5765.60] Because he lives.
[5765.60 → 5769.60] Oh, fear is gone.
[5769.60 → 5776.60] Because I know he holds the future.
[5776.60 → 5786.60] And life is worth living just because he lives.
[5786.60 → 5803.60] And life is worth living just because he lives.
[5803.60 → 5805.60] And life is worth living just because the sarge can do.
[5809.60 → 5810.60] And life is born with Oskarsis.
[5810.60 → 5812.60] But I have never felt living just because.
[5812.60 → 5813.60] And when you forget.
[5813.60 → 5814.70] I feel sorry it was all right and listen.
[5814.76 → 5816.60] Come here.
[5816.60 → 5817.60] I do.
[5818.60 → 5820.60] And I look at that ladder.
[5821.60 → 5823.60] The tip of pride, hard to have a secretreshold嘛.
[5823.60 → 5853.58] Thank you.
[5853.60 → 5883.58] Thank you.
[5883.60 → 5913.58] Thank you.
[5913.60 → 5943.58] Thank you.
[5943.60 → 5973.58] Thank you.
[5973.60 → 6003.58] Thank you.
[6003.60 → 6033.58] Thank you.
