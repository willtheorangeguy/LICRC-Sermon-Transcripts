[0.00 --> 2.20]  I think that's my list.
[2.34 --> 3.74]  I could be wrong if I missed it.
[3.88 --> 4.64]  It couldn't have been that important.
[5.98 --> 6.56]  Please stand.
[7.08 --> 8.88]  We're going to gather together in God's presence,
[9.26 --> 13.00]  worship Him as we are greeted by Him in worship.
[15.28 --> 18.96]  Grace, mercy, and peace to you
[18.96 --> 21.84]  from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ
[21.84 --> 25.26]  through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.

[45.48 --> 46.82]  Praise the Lord, my soul.
[47.60 --> 49.70]  I will praise the Lord all my life.
[49.78 --> 53.28]  I will sing praise to my God as long as I live.
[54.40 --> 59.04]  Do not put trust in princes, in human beings who cannot save.
[59.04 --> 62.36]  When their spirit departs, they return to the ground.
[62.98 --> 65.96]  On that very day, their plans come to nothing.
[67.46 --> 70.80]  Blessed are those whose help is the God of Jacob,
[71.10 --> 73.52]  whose hope is in the Lord their God.
[73.52 --> 78.80]  He is the maker of heaven and earth, the sea and everything in them.
[78.80 --> 80.62]  He remains faithful forever.
[81.52 --> 85.32]  He upholds the cause of the oppressed and gives food to the hungry.
[85.88 --> 87.70]  The Lord sets prisoners free.
[87.70 --> 89.80]  The Lord gives sight to the blind.
[89.80 --> 93.44]  The Lord lifts up those who are bowed down.
[93.98 --> 95.86]  The Lord loves the righteous.
[96.66 --> 100.58]  The Lord watches over the foreigner and sustains the fatherless and the widow.
[101.22 --> 104.02]  But he frustrates the ways of the wicked.
[105.50 --> 107.00]  The Lord reigns forever.
[107.40 --> 109.90]  Your God, O Zion, for all generations.
[109.90 --> 112.40]  Praise the Lord.
[112.40 --> 112.44]  Praise the Lord.
[112.44 --> 112.48]  Praise the Lord.

[341.02 --> 343.20]  It's your love.

[345.70 --> 348.60]  So we pour out our praise.
[348.76 --> 350.88]  We pour out our praise.
[350.88 --> 352.46]  It's your love.

[355.40 --> 358.28]  So we pour out our praise.

[419.60 --> 426.60]  Till we pour out our praise, we pour out our praise with your pride.
[427.60 --> 434.60]  In our lives, till we pour out our praise with all we.
[434.60 --> 453.60]  In our lives, till we pour out our praise with all we.
[453.60 --> 466.68]  Praise the Lord, and all the earth will shout your praise.
[466.96 --> 471.44]  Our hearts will cry, these poems will sing.
[471.44 --> 480.44]  Praise the Lord, and all the earth will shout your praise.
[480.44 --> 485.32]  And all the earth will shout your praise.
[485.54 --> 490.04]  Our hearts will cry, these poems will sing.
[491.84 --> 498.44]  Praise the Lord, and all the earth will shout your praise.
[498.44 --> 503.44]  Our hearts will cry, these poems will sing.
[503.44 --> 509.44]  Till we pour out our praise, we pour out our praise with your pride.
[509.44 --> 516.44]  In our lungs, till we pour out our praise with your pride.
[516.44 --> 526.44]  In your breath, in our lungs, till we pour out our praise with your pride.
[526.44 --> 533.44]  In our lungs, till we pour out our praise with your pride.
[533.44 --> 540.44]  Till we pour out our praise with your pride.
[540.44 --> 559.88]  Our confession and assurance today is coming from, um, I have a worship bible that has little sections in it that are paraphrased scripture.
[559.88 --> 562.88]  So it's from a whole bunch of places in scripture.
[562.88 --> 564.88]  But it's, it's really God speaking to us.
[564.88 --> 575.88]  Because of my great love for you, and in the richness of my mercy, I made you alive with Christ, even when you were dead in sin.
[575.88 --> 580.88]  I saved you and called you to live a holy life.
[580.88 --> 587.88]  I did this, not because of anything you have done, but because of my own purpose and grace.
[587.88 --> 590.88]  For it is by grace you have been saved through faith.
[590.88 --> 594.88]  This is not from yourself or by your own works.
[594.88 --> 596.88]  It is simply my gift to you.
[596.88 --> 599.88]  You could never buy or earn this gift.
[599.88 --> 602.88]  Jesus paid the full price.
[602.88 --> 605.88]  By his blood, you are now justified.
[605.88 --> 609.88]  Never think that your observance of my laws will save you.
[609.88 --> 615.88]  As you keep them, they will have their own measure of reward, but they will not save you.
[615.88 --> 618.88]  It is only my grace that makes you whole.
[618.88 --> 622.88]  No amount of good works will save you either.
[622.88 --> 630.88]  Rather, you have been created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which I have prepared in advance for you to do.
[630.88 --> 637.88]  The fact is that you have been crucified with Christ and no longer live, but Christ lives in you.
[637.88 --> 645.88]  The life you live in the body, you must live by faith in my son, who loved you and gave himself for you.
[645.88 --> 656.88]  Therefore, count yourself dead to sin, but alive in Christ Jesus, and live a life worthy of the calling you have received.
[656.88 --> 664.88]  Now, we can only recognize the magnitude of his grace and mercy when we face the sin and ugliness in our own lives.
[664.88 --> 673.88]  And so let us lay our sins before him now in a time of silent confession, so that we can embrace the richness of his mercy.
[673.88 --> 701.88]  Let us pray.
[701.88 --> 706.88]  We have been transformed from death to life, from ashes to beauty, and all by the power of your grace.
[706.88 --> 710.88]  And without purpose or value, you saved us, Lord Jesus.
[710.88 --> 713.88]  We did nothing to earn this salvation.
[713.88 --> 718.88]  It was only by your power and for your pleasure that you saved us.
[718.88 --> 723.88]  You crafted us into a new creations full of divine purpose and value.
[723.88 --> 731.88]  We have been transformed from death to life, from ashes to beauty, and all by the power of your grace.
[731.88 --> 733.88]  What can we do in response?
[733.88 --> 739.88]  But thank you for living in us and to seek with all of our hearts to live in you.
[739.88 --> 740.88]  Amen.
[740.88 --> 747.88]  I ask you, if you can, to stand and sing with us.
[747.88 --> 769.44]  And to have you
[769.44 --> 775.02]  For since we are heading, His mercy is gone
[775.02 --> 782.86]  And not we can burn, no wrongs we have done
[782.86 --> 787.92]  Our mission's all going, He counts on their soul
[787.92 --> 793.28]  For into the sea, the part of our shore
[793.28 --> 799.68]  For since we are heading, His mercy is gone
[799.68 --> 807.00]  Praise the Lord, His mercy is gone
[807.00 --> 814.28]  Shorter the darkness to everyborn
[814.80 --> 820.10]  For since we are heading, His mercy is gone
[823.28 --> 828.32]  What patience would be, as He lost and He bo'd
[828.32 --> 833.36]  Our Father so tender, His calling us home
[833.36 --> 839.26]  He will be broken, the fireless of all
[839.26 --> 844.48]  For since we are heading, His mercy is gone
[844.48 --> 852.34]  Praise the Lord, His mercy is gone
[852.34 --> 859.42]  Stronger than darkness to everyborn
[859.42 --> 865.42]  For since we are heading, His mercy is gone
[865.42 --> 873.62]  What bridges of kindness He lavished on us
[873.62 --> 878.50]  His blood was the famous, His life was the cause
[878.50 --> 883.58]  His love, His mercy is gone
[883.58 --> 885.58]  His mercy is gone
[885.58 --> 890.66]  Praise the Lord, His mercy is gone
[890.66 --> 894.66]  Praise the Lord, His mercy is gone
[894.66 --> 896.66]  His mercy is gone
[896.66 --> 898.66]  His mercy is gone
[898.66 --> 909.74]  Stronger than darkness to everyborn
[909.74 --> 918.82]  His mercy is gone
[918.82 --> 922.82]  His mercy is gone
[922.82 --> 931.90]  His mercy is gone
[931.90 --> 933.90]  His mercy is gone
[933.90 --> 935.90]  His mercy is gone
[935.90 --> 944.98]  His mercy is gone
[944.98 --> 960.06]  I will glory in my Redeemer
[960.06 --> 964.14]  I will glory in my Redeemer
[964.14 --> 975.22]  Who crush the problems of sin and death
[975.22 --> 980.30]  My all will be saved
[980.30 --> 991.38]  My all will be saved
[991.38 --> 993.38]  Before the Holy Church
[993.38 --> 995.38]  The Lamb who is my righteous guest
[995.38 --> 999.38]  The Lamb who is my righteous guest
[999.38 --> 1004.46]  The Lamb who is my righteous guest
[1004.46 --> 1006.46]  The Lamb who is my righteous guest
[1006.46 --> 1017.46]  I will glory in my Redeemer
[1017.46 --> 1019.74]  My life be bought
[1019.74 --> 1022.46]  My love be owned
[1022.46 --> 1037.54]  I will glory in my Redeemer
[1037.54 --> 1041.54]  His faithfulness my standing day
[1041.54 --> 1047.46]  Your foes are binding and rush upon me
[1047.46 --> 1050.44]  My feet are firm
[1050.44 --> 1052.16]  God is raised
[1052.16 --> 1055.06]  My feet are firm
[1055.06 --> 1057.18]  God is raised
[1057.18 --> 1059.06]  My feet are firm
[1059.06 --> 1060.46]  God is raised
[1060.46 --> 1065.10]  My feet are firm
[1065.10 --> 1066.08]  God is raised
[1066.08 --> 1068.14]  My feet are firm
[1068.14 --> 1070.16]  God is raised
[1070.16 --> 1071.82]  I will glory in my Redeemer
[1071.82 --> 1074.32]  Who carries me on eagles' wings
[1074.32 --> 1076.22]  He crowns my life
[1076.22 --> 1085.22]  With loving kindness, His triumphs on all efforts to be.
[1085.22 --> 1094.22]  I will glory in my Redeemer, who waits for me, I'm King of gold.
[1094.22 --> 1105.22]  And then God will be in my paradise, His grace forever to be home.
[1106.22 --> 1111.22]  His grace forever to be home.
[1111.22 --> 1121.22]  I will glory in my Redeemer, who waits for me, I'm King of gold.
[1121.22 --> 1134.22]  And when He calls me, it will be paradise, His grace forever to be home.
[1134.22 --> 1141.22]  His grace forever to be home.
[1141.22 --> 1146.22]  I invite you to be seated.
[1146.22 --> 1159.22]  Good morning.
[1159.22 --> 1163.22]  My name is Brenda and I'm a Deacon here at Emmanuel.
[1163.22 --> 1166.22]  We continue our worship with the giving of our gifts.
[1166.22 --> 1170.22]  First for the budget, which covers the administration of the church and its ministries.
[1170.22 --> 1176.22]  And our special offering today is for World Renew, the Ukraine response.
[1176.22 --> 1185.22]  Last week we gave to World Renew and they are about living justice, loving mercy and serving Christ.
[1185.22 --> 1188.22]  They're compelled by God's deep passion for justice and mercy.
[1188.22 --> 1194.22]  And we join with communities around the world to renew hope, reconcile lives and restore creation.
[1194.22 --> 1199.22]  Today is again for World Renew, but it is specific to the Ukraine response.
[1199.22 --> 1209.22]  World Renew is overwhelmed by the support given to people left vulnerable, displaced and traumatized by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.
[1209.22 --> 1221.22]  Working with other members in their global response network, World Renew has been able to provide emergency food, shelter items and medical care to families affected by this tragic conflict.
[1221.22 --> 1228.22]  Here are just a few ways gifts received have shared Christ's hope with people left vulnerable by this crisis.
[1228.22 --> 1236.22]  In central and eastern Ukraine, where food is becoming scarce, people are receiving emergency food as well as other essential relief items.
[1236.22 --> 1246.22]  Displaced and conflict affected households in the region of Transcarpathia, where an estimated 500,000 displaced people now reside,
[1246.22 --> 1252.22]  are receiving cash assistance to support their emergency food and non-food needs.
[1252.22 --> 1261.22]  Refugees that have fled to Moldova, where 89% of them are women and children, are receiving much needed medical care.
[1261.22 --> 1271.22]  World Renew says thank you for your compassion and your gifts, and please continue to keep the people impacted by conflict in Ukraine in your prayers.
[1271.22 --> 1282.22]  Hebrews 6 verse 10 says, God is not unjust. He will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue to help them.
[1282.22 --> 1291.22]  Next week's offering is for Safe Church Ministry, which equips congregations in abuse awareness, prevention and response.
[1291.22 --> 1293.22]  Let's keep generous.
[1293.22 --> 1313.22]  The sun cannot compare to the glory of your love.

[1619.20 --> 1620.36]  reconciliation dwell

[1643.86 --> 1645.86]  continue to move all
[1645.86 --> 1646.76]  of us to reach out
[1646.76 --> 1647.58]  and connect with the
[1647.58 --> 1648.58]  variety of people at
[1648.58 --> 1649.68]  our church from young
[1649.68 --> 1651.74]  to old and thank you
[1651.74 --> 1652.24]  for providing
[1652.24 --> 1653.40]  opportunities to serve
[1653.40 --> 1654.72]  here at this church
[1654.72 --> 1656.76]  as we enter a new
[1656.76 --> 1658.38]  season of ministry we
[1658.38 --> 1659.26]  ask that you will stir
[1659.26 --> 1660.42]  hearts to be willing to
[1660.42 --> 1661.60]  volunteer in various
[1661.60 --> 1665.08]  meaningful ways with the
[1665.08 --> 1665.68]  new school year
[1665.68 --> 1667.02]  starting we pray for all
[1667.02 --> 1667.92]  of those returning from
[1667.92 --> 1669.26]  vacation and those
[1669.26 --> 1671.36]  preparing for school be
[1671.36 --> 1672.18]  present with school
[1672.18 --> 1674.24]  staff families and
[1674.24 --> 1675.28]  especially the students
[1675.28 --> 1676.44]  as they anticipate a
[1676.44 --> 1678.56]  fresh start we ask for
[1678.56 --> 1679.50]  your blessing on the
[1679.50 --> 1680.64]  relationships and
[1680.64 --> 1681.28]  learning that will
[1681.28 --> 1684.18]  happen we also pray for
[1684.18 --> 1684.96]  those who are starting
[1684.96 --> 1686.36]  college or university or
[1686.36 --> 1687.36]  continuing on in their
[1687.36 --> 1688.18]  post-secondary
[1688.18 --> 1690.38]  education particularly for
[1690.38 --> 1691.48]  those beginning their
[1691.48 --> 1693.98]  first year where travel
[1693.98 --> 1695.04]  and distance are involved
[1695.04 --> 1696.70]  provide safety and your
[1696.70 --> 1700.92]  presence as we yet live in
[1700.92 --> 1702.78]  a fallen world we cry out
[1702.78 --> 1704.50]  for your mercy and justice
[1704.50 --> 1707.66]  comfort those who mourn who
[1707.66 --> 1709.42]  flee and who hunger and
[1709.42 --> 1711.80]  thirst soften hearts of
[1711.80 --> 1713.24]  leaders worldwide to
[1713.24 --> 1714.62]  administer your love and
[1714.62 --> 1716.04]  justice for people and your
[1716.04 --> 1718.42]  creation and continue to move
[1718.42 --> 1719.92]  in our hearts that we can
[1719.92 --> 1721.60]  serve you and serve others
[1721.60 --> 1725.82]  as we anticipate hearing your
[1725.82 --> 1727.78]  word open our hearts and
[1727.78 --> 1729.82]  minds to willingly receive the
[1729.82 --> 1732.14]  truth may we respond with
[1732.14 --> 1733.50]  willing lives of service
[1733.50 --> 1735.74]  being faithful to you our
[1735.74 --> 1738.26]  faithful God in Jesus name
[1738.26 --> 1738.92]  amen
[1738.92 --> 1739.00]  amen
[1739.00 --> 1768.98]  for your
[1768.98 --> 1776.90]  at some of the parables of Jesus in our worship together, and we're going to continue doing that
[1776.90 --> 1786.00]  this morning with a parable from Matthew 18, the parable of the unmerciful servant. And so if you
[1786.00 --> 1791.74]  have a Bible handy, whether one that you turn actual pages of or one that you have to turn on,
[1791.74 --> 1798.52]  please go ahead and do that. Get that ready. It will be on the screen overhead there, but
[1798.52 --> 1805.48]  I encourage you to keep one in your hands and ready to go. Join me then in reading God's word for us
[1805.48 --> 1812.06]  this morning. Matthew 18, I'll start at verse 21. The screen will catch up to me when I get there.
[1812.98 --> 1819.22]  I made a change, Linda. Sorry. Then Peter came to Jesus and asked,
[1819.52 --> 1826.86]  how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?
[1826.86 --> 1840.42]  Jesus answered, I tell you, not seven times, but 77 times. Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a
[1840.42 --> 1849.12]  king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. As he began the settlement, a man who owed him 10,000
[1849.12 --> 1856.86]  bags of gold was brought to him. Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered that he and his wife
[1856.86 --> 1865.16]  and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt. Now this, the servant fell on his knees
[1865.16 --> 1875.16]  before him. Be patient with me, he begged, and I will pay back everything. The servant's master took pity on him,
[1875.16 --> 1879.06]  canceled the debt, and let him go.
[1881.40 --> 1888.40]  But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred silver coins.
[1889.02 --> 1893.14]  He grabbed him and began to choke him. Pay back what you owe me, he demanded.
[1894.48 --> 1897.84]  His fellow servant fell on his knees and begged him,
[1897.84 --> 1901.12]  Be patient with me, and I will pay it back.
[1902.56 --> 1903.80]  But he refused.
[1904.94 --> 1909.36]  Instead, he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt.
[1910.36 --> 1913.16]  When the other servants saw what had happened,
[1913.60 --> 1917.76]  they were outraged and went and told their master everything that had happened.
[1917.76 --> 1921.56]  The master called the servant in.
[1921.56 --> 1924.08]  You wicked servant, he said.
[1924.78 --> 1928.32]  I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to.
[1928.84 --> 1933.88]  Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you?
[1935.48 --> 1942.62]  In anger, his master handed him over to the jailers to be tortured until he should pay back all he owed.
[1942.62 --> 1953.20]  This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.
[1954.28 --> 1955.62]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1960.02 --> 1964.64]  This is one of those times where, especially after reading the last line of the text,
[1964.86 --> 1967.86]  it sort of feels really hard to say, thanks be to God.
[1969.20 --> 1969.64]  Right?
[1969.64 --> 1972.02]  This is how you will be treated, tortured,
[1973.02 --> 1977.00]  unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.
[1977.66 --> 1978.42]  Thanks be to God.
[1980.80 --> 1984.44]  C.S. Lewis, the author of the Chronicles of Narnia,
[1984.74 --> 1988.04]  the Space Trilogy, the Screwtape Letters,
[1988.12 --> 1989.80]  and a whole bunch of other really awesome things.
[1990.28 --> 1991.30]  C.S. Lewis said,
[1991.82 --> 1995.06]  Everyone says forgiveness is a lovely idea
[1995.06 --> 1997.66]  until they have something to forgive.
[1999.64 --> 2000.92]  We know what that's like.
[2002.14 --> 2002.24]  Right?
[2002.28 --> 2006.70]  It's really easy to be wronged or to be hurt and to want justice,
[2007.20 --> 2008.40]  to want revenge,
[2008.54 --> 2009.98]  to try and get even.
[2011.40 --> 2013.06]  You've probably heard it before,
[2013.16 --> 2014.08]  maybe even from me.
[2014.42 --> 2016.20]  Hurt people hurt people.
[2017.02 --> 2017.46]  Right?
[2017.52 --> 2018.90]  When someone hurts us,
[2018.92 --> 2020.42]  even if it's a small slight,
[2020.80 --> 2022.78]  or we get cut off in traffic,
[2023.16 --> 2025.20]  or even worse than getting cut off in traffic
[2025.20 --> 2026.46]  when you're driving down the highway
[2026.46 --> 2027.72]  and you're in the left lane
[2027.72 --> 2028.84]  and the person in front of you
[2028.84 --> 2030.96]  is speed matching the person beside them
[2030.96 --> 2032.66]  and they're both going 10 kilometers less
[2032.66 --> 2033.66]  than the posted speed limit,
[2034.10 --> 2035.64]  there's nothing worse.
[2039.04 --> 2040.48]  Or, even more,
[2040.66 --> 2042.10]  and actually,
[2043.10 --> 2045.04]  when someone does something awful
[2045.04 --> 2046.80]  to you,
[2046.80 --> 2050.04]  when people who are supposed to love us
[2050.04 --> 2050.58]  leave
[2050.58 --> 2053.02]  or they hurt us,
[2054.52 --> 2057.16]  forgiveness isn't our default.
[2058.26 --> 2059.30]  Hurting back is.
[2060.46 --> 2062.48]  And hurting back can be a fight,
[2062.88 --> 2065.22]  but it can also be flight.
[2065.68 --> 2065.84]  Right?
[2065.96 --> 2068.44]  Even as we try to punish the person
[2068.44 --> 2069.58]  in our own minds
[2069.58 --> 2072.22]  by robbing them of our presence in their lives.
[2072.22 --> 2074.90]  This morning,
[2075.26 --> 2077.56]  we're going to do the hard work together
[2077.56 --> 2080.28]  of talking about forgiveness.
[2082.20 --> 2082.66]  Now,
[2083.34 --> 2084.52]  in our house,
[2084.58 --> 2085.38]  in my family's house,
[2086.26 --> 2088.48]  we have a way of being together
[2088.48 --> 2090.00]  that we have designed,
[2090.22 --> 2091.10]  Rachel and I,
[2091.16 --> 2091.62]  as parents,
[2091.70 --> 2092.44]  very intentionally,
[2092.80 --> 2095.12]  so that when someone wrongs you
[2095.12 --> 2096.78]  or when someone does something wrong,
[2096.86 --> 2098.98]  if one of my kids hit the other,
[2099.08 --> 2099.84]  they never do that.
[2099.90 --> 2100.06]  Right?
[2100.74 --> 2101.90]  If they yell at each other,
[2102.22 --> 2104.20]  or if they get hurt by someone,
[2104.28 --> 2104.42]  right,
[2104.52 --> 2106.26]  unjustly or unfairly,
[2106.32 --> 2107.22]  their feelings are hurt,
[2107.62 --> 2110.00]  that the person who does the wrong,
[2110.12 --> 2110.88]  the offender,
[2111.30 --> 2113.60]  has to approach the one who's been hurt
[2113.60 --> 2114.54]  and say,
[2115.04 --> 2115.54]  I'm sorry.
[2116.98 --> 2117.44]  Now,
[2117.48 --> 2118.20]  this can be hard,
[2118.30 --> 2118.46]  right?
[2118.48 --> 2119.06]  Even just saying,
[2119.14 --> 2119.64]  I'm sorry.
[2119.98 --> 2121.98]  Especially if we're still processing
[2121.98 --> 2124.32]  the emotions that made us angry
[2124.32 --> 2126.80]  or the thing that caused us to hurt someone
[2126.80 --> 2128.14]  in the first place.
[2129.04 --> 2129.18]  And,
[2129.64 --> 2130.12]  as well,
[2130.12 --> 2132.42]  there's some shame involved here.
[2132.94 --> 2133.14]  Right?
[2133.18 --> 2135.16]  From a young age,
[2135.22 --> 2135.34]  right,
[2135.40 --> 2135.56]  there's,
[2135.92 --> 2137.94]  we feel bad when we do bad,
[2138.02 --> 2139.32]  or at least most of the time.
[2140.70 --> 2141.34]  And so,
[2141.50 --> 2144.66]  when my kids are saying sorry,
[2144.84 --> 2145.92]  it can be hard for them
[2145.92 --> 2147.46]  to make eye contact.
[2147.72 --> 2148.52]  It can be hard for them
[2148.52 --> 2149.60]  to be honest.
[2149.72 --> 2151.76]  When I am saying sorry,
[2152.46 --> 2153.42]  it can be hard for me
[2153.42 --> 2154.84]  to make eye contact.
[2155.04 --> 2155.74]  It can be hard for me
[2155.74 --> 2156.74]  to understand the depth
[2156.74 --> 2157.70]  of the impact
[2157.70 --> 2158.18]  of the thing
[2158.18 --> 2160.16]  that I am apologizing for.
[2161.38 --> 2161.90]  Sometimes,
[2162.72 --> 2164.24]  physically or emotionally,
[2164.52 --> 2164.94]  we run
[2164.94 --> 2166.18]  and we hide.
[2167.14 --> 2167.26]  Right?
[2167.26 --> 2169.28]  We know that there's something wrong
[2169.28 --> 2169.92]  and the guilt
[2169.92 --> 2171.06]  and the shame
[2171.06 --> 2172.56]  of being found out
[2172.56 --> 2174.04]  allows us to do this.
[2175.34 --> 2175.56]  Now,
[2176.14 --> 2177.80]  because Rachel and I
[2177.80 --> 2179.40]  recognize that
[2179.40 --> 2181.16]  we are not just teaching
[2181.16 --> 2181.86]  our kids
[2181.86 --> 2183.00]  how to be good people,
[2183.00 --> 2184.60]  but part of the responsibility
[2184.60 --> 2185.48]  of parenting,
[2185.62 --> 2185.80]  right,
[2185.86 --> 2186.98]  is to reveal
[2186.98 --> 2188.22]  the nature of God
[2188.22 --> 2189.34]  to your kids.
[2190.32 --> 2190.54]  Right?
[2190.58 --> 2191.78]  The nature of His forgiveness.
[2192.84 --> 2193.04]  And so,
[2193.14 --> 2193.70]  as parents,
[2193.84 --> 2194.78]  we have decided
[2194.78 --> 2196.08]  on very specific ways
[2196.08 --> 2196.86]  that we talk to them,
[2196.90 --> 2197.70]  where we approach them,
[2197.76 --> 2198.82]  where we get down
[2198.82 --> 2199.52]  to their level
[2199.52 --> 2200.24]  so we can look them
[2200.24 --> 2200.80]  in the eyes
[2200.80 --> 2201.84]  and we can wrap our arms
[2201.84 --> 2202.34]  around them
[2202.34 --> 2202.94]  and hug them
[2202.94 --> 2203.90]  and look them
[2203.90 --> 2205.10]  squarely in the face
[2205.10 --> 2205.54]  and say,
[2205.64 --> 2206.48]  I love you
[2206.48 --> 2208.10]  and
[2208.10 --> 2210.36]  I forgive you.
[2212.24 --> 2212.64]  Right?
[2212.64 --> 2213.50]  We make it a point
[2213.50 --> 2214.12]  to say,
[2214.30 --> 2214.98]  I forgive you
[2214.98 --> 2216.30]  and to teach our kids
[2216.30 --> 2217.18]  and encourage them
[2217.18 --> 2217.98]  to say,
[2218.22 --> 2219.32]  I forgive you.
[2221.06 --> 2222.46]  But you know what I've noticed?
[2223.92 --> 2224.90]  That sometimes,
[2225.04 --> 2226.20]  maybe even every time,
[2226.26 --> 2227.50]  if you're taking it seriously,
[2228.72 --> 2230.18]  it is just as hard
[2230.18 --> 2230.86]  to say,
[2231.36 --> 2232.30]  I forgive you
[2232.30 --> 2233.92]  as it is to say,
[2234.02 --> 2234.52]  I'm sorry.
[2236.28 --> 2237.06]  Because forgiveness,
[2237.34 --> 2238.06]  it turns out,
[2238.32 --> 2239.26]  is hard
[2239.26 --> 2240.82]  and it's costly.
[2242.04 --> 2242.16]  Right?
[2242.16 --> 2243.48]  And not just for you,
[2243.86 --> 2244.00]  right?
[2244.04 --> 2244.94]  But for Jesus,
[2245.14 --> 2245.28]  right?
[2245.30 --> 2247.08]  For Jesus to forgive us,
[2247.16 --> 2248.14]  for God to forgive us,
[2248.26 --> 2250.84]  it cost Jesus his life.
[2251.62 --> 2254.06]  It cost God the Father his son.
[2254.90 --> 2255.02]  Right?
[2255.04 --> 2256.50]  And because God forgives
[2256.50 --> 2258.46]  an infinite debt,
[2260.96 --> 2264.34]  there's a consequent responsibility
[2264.34 --> 2267.50]  for us also
[2267.50 --> 2268.60]  to forgive us,
[2268.60 --> 2269.08]  to forgive
[2269.08 --> 2269.10]  to forgive
[2269.10 --> 2270.56]  infinitely.
[2272.40 --> 2273.26]  That's the main point
[2273.26 --> 2273.94]  of this parable.
[2274.88 --> 2276.06]  To put it another way,
[2276.24 --> 2277.16]  the big idea,
[2277.32 --> 2277.46]  right?
[2277.82 --> 2279.50]  Christians have received
[2279.50 --> 2281.22]  extravagant grace
[2281.22 --> 2282.42]  and so,
[2282.60 --> 2283.16]  Christians
[2283.16 --> 2284.28]  give
[2284.28 --> 2285.74]  extravagant
[2285.74 --> 2286.80]  grace.
[2288.96 --> 2290.36]  Christians have received
[2290.36 --> 2291.28]  extravagant grace
[2291.28 --> 2291.90]  from God
[2291.90 --> 2292.44]  in forgiveness
[2292.44 --> 2301.06]  and so Christians give extravagant grace in response. To make that point, Jesus uses this
[2301.06 --> 2307.80]  parable. He says there once was a king and a servant who had an incredible debt to pay him.
[2308.60 --> 2314.86]  The man, the servant, owed the king, we read, 10,000 bags of gold. If you've been around church
[2314.86 --> 2321.70]  for a while, an older translation of that says 10,000 talents. That is clearly a huge amount of
[2321.70 --> 2329.32]  money. In fact, if you work it out, it would take the number, if you take the number literally in
[2329.32 --> 2344.22]  Greek, the average worker would take 164,000 years to pay it back. Not days, not weeks, years.
[2344.22 --> 2352.58]  In fact, one scholar says the Greek language cannot express by two words a definite sum
[2352.58 --> 2359.88]  larger than this. It's like when my son Malachi, who's seven, says, I have 10,000 million dollars.
[2360.84 --> 2368.96]  Right? It's an impossible sum. And the man knows it's impossible. The king knows it's impossible,
[2368.96 --> 2375.16]  but still, the man falls to his knees in front of the king and he pleads for time. Right? In this
[2375.16 --> 2384.32]  impossible situation, he says, be patient with me. I'll pay it all back. Now, I think there's
[2384.32 --> 2388.90]  something here for us to notice and I want you to get it, right? Because everyone knows it's
[2388.90 --> 2395.52]  impossible, but this man, this servant, he doubles down in the delusion and says, I'll pay it back.
[2395.52 --> 2403.46]  I think there's two things worth seeing quickly here. First, it is human nature, or it is fallen
[2403.46 --> 2411.96]  human nature, to overestimate our ability to pay it back, right? To pay the debt, to fix the relational
[2411.96 --> 2423.50]  problem with the king. We want to do it because we want to be in control of the solution, because we
[2423.50 --> 2429.80]  believe that if we are in control of the solution, we feel like we're in control of the problem.
[2431.14 --> 2435.52]  Now, let me track that with you again, right? Because it's so much bigger than monetary debt.
[2436.20 --> 2443.46]  We want to control the solution because then we feel a sense of control over the problem. And if I
[2443.46 --> 2447.72]  can get a handle on the problem, it can't actually really be that big.
[2447.72 --> 2455.90]  Because I have the ability to handle it. We want to control the fix because it gives us a false sense
[2455.90 --> 2464.52]  of managing the problem. I want you to think about that and how that idea is showing up in your life
[2464.52 --> 2472.34]  over this next week. Second thing I want you to see here when he says, I can pay it back.
[2472.34 --> 2486.12]  Now, when he says that, I wonder if he is operating out of an idea that the problem, the debt, is so big
[2486.12 --> 2494.64]  that it is functionally meaningless. Now, let me give you a parallel example of what I mean. Now, when I
[2494.64 --> 2502.32]  give this example, please note, I'm not an economist, nor am I actually really good with money, nor very
[2502.32 --> 2507.14]  responsible with money. That's part of Rachel's role in our life together. But I think that actually makes
[2507.14 --> 2517.30]  this point more clearly. And so think about global national debt. Okay, the gross national debt for Canada
[2517.30 --> 2529.94]  in 2020 was $2,852 billion. That goes up every year. In the U.S., that's $27 trillion. And every year, the
[2529.94 --> 2536.50]  Congress votes to raise the debt ceiling just so it can go higher and higher. Now, as a Canadian citizen,
[2537.74 --> 2548.10]  I own that debt. Right? That $2,852 billion is technically my debt. They assess that debt on a
[2548.10 --> 2556.04]  per capita basis. I am a capita here in Canada. I own that debt. And what I have learned is that like
[2556.04 --> 2564.22]  the S&P Global Financial Institution and Moody's or the Fitch Credit Rating System, that this number
[2564.22 --> 2571.10]  apparently has some relation to, you know, fiscal solvency and the ability for us to borrow and for
[2571.10 --> 2580.24]  creditors and the like. But those numbers are so big that it would be impossible for us to pay them
[2580.24 --> 2587.16]  should the creditors come calling. And we just live with it. Like that doesn't actually make sense.
[2588.68 --> 2594.10]  Right? The number, the economic reality of them for most of us, probably even for all of us, even if
[2594.10 --> 2599.54]  we are economists, even if we do understand all of this, those numbers are so big that they are
[2599.54 --> 2607.22]  functionally meaningless. And so, except that to say those numbers are functionally meaningless,
[2607.22 --> 2614.92]  I can't say I've ever thought about it or fretted about it. But I've never been concerned, and maybe that
[2614.92 --> 2620.94]  makes me a bad citizen, I don't know, but I've never been concerned about gross national debt. Even
[2620.94 --> 2633.66]  though I own it, I just live with it like it's no big deal. Maybe, just maybe, that's how we think, or rather
[2633.66 --> 2646.24]  don't think about our debt in sin to God. That it's so big, it is functionally meaningless. And you don't
[2646.24 --> 2652.88]  have to give it a second thought. And so, like the servant to the king, when the debt holder comes
[2652.88 --> 2658.66]  calling, we go, yeah, yeah, sure, I got it, no problem. And we just casually dismiss it.
[2658.66 --> 2667.26]  I want you to chew on that this week as well. Take that, both of those, back to the story.
[2667.76 --> 2673.22]  The man knows it's impossible. The king knows it's impossible. And yet, in an extravagant act of
[2673.22 --> 2678.22]  grace, the king doesn't just give the man more time, right? He asks for more time. The king says,
[2678.22 --> 2690.74]  you know what? Gone. Erased. Forgiven. Now, as you read the story, you would hope, you would expect
[2690.74 --> 2697.38]  the man to run out of the king's court exuberant and joyful. That's the story we want to hear.
[2697.92 --> 2704.66]  That's likely what the first hearers of this story expected to hear in the next move. But that's not
[2704.66 --> 2710.32]  the story that Jesus tells. Instead, we're told that this man left the king's court and he came
[2710.32 --> 2716.20]  to someone who owed him money. And by comparison, this man owes him only a few dollars. And the newly
[2716.20 --> 2721.02]  forgiven man grabs him and begins to choke him. And he says, pay back what you owe me. And with a
[2721.02 --> 2727.98]  surprise choice of words or with some excellent writing here by Matthew and speaking by Jesus,
[2728.90 --> 2733.94]  this second servant responds with almost exactly the same words, says, be patient with me
[2733.94 --> 2740.74]  and I will pay you back. But he isn't patient. He doesn't extend the same grace.
[2742.42 --> 2747.76]  It is sometimes harder to forgive than to say, I'm sorry.
[2752.44 --> 2760.56]  But what do we know? That Christians have received extravagant grace and so Christians give
[2760.56 --> 2768.60]  extravagant grace. Because if you don't, the king hears about this and he asks, I canceled all that
[2768.60 --> 2774.44]  debt of yours because you begged me to. Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I
[2774.44 --> 2780.42]  had had on you? And so remember what started this story. Peter asked Jesus, how many times should I
[2780.42 --> 2788.48]  forgive someone who sins against me? Up to seven times. Now, in those days, a little bit of history for you.
[2788.48 --> 2795.28]  In those days, the rabbis, the other rabbis around Jesus taught that people had to forgive a brother
[2795.28 --> 2803.84]  for sin up to three times. If you've forgiven him once, you've forgiven him twice, you've forgiven him
[2803.84 --> 2811.80]  thrice. After that, it's on them. That's their problem. Right? No more forgiveness needed. And so get what
[2811.80 --> 2818.66]  Peter's doing. Right? Every other rabbi says three times, Peter's like, I know Jesus. I know how he
[2818.66 --> 2824.36]  operates. Right? I know what he's been saying about how we're supposed to live together and be loving
[2824.36 --> 2830.84]  and generous. So Peter is being super generous. Right? He's doubling it plus one.
[2830.84 --> 2840.28]  grace upon grace. Or so he thinks. And again, we get it. Right? Because honestly, how many times
[2840.28 --> 2847.18]  do we have to forgive someone for doing the same thing over and over again? You know the saying,
[2847.30 --> 2855.66]  fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. And this is the point in the parable
[2855.66 --> 2862.04]  where Jesus loses us. Where people who don't get it won't get it. Right? You remember that Jesus
[2862.04 --> 2867.30]  tells these stories to confuse the people who aren't meant to get it. Everyone knows that forgiveness
[2867.30 --> 2873.88]  matters. Everyone knows that you have to forgive hurts and especially accidents. But what if they do it
[2873.88 --> 2882.80]  again? And what if they do it again? And what if they do it one more time? And God forbid, what if they do it
[2882.80 --> 2891.86]  again? At some point, surely, right, we can stop forgiving them. I mean, isn't that just me protecting
[2891.86 --> 2903.02]  myself? Peter asks the question and Jesus says, not seven times, but 77 times. In some versions, it says
[2903.02 --> 2911.28]  70 times seven times. Right? The point here isn't a fixed number. It's Jesus isn't saying count out to 78
[2911.28 --> 2917.52]  and then on the 79th, right? They can remain unforgiven. Or he's not saying count out to 490
[2917.52 --> 2922.72]  and then on the 491st, you can stop forgiving them. Right? The point that Jesus is making here,
[2922.78 --> 2933.08]  the point that we need to hear and see is never give up on anyone. Always be forgiving.
[2933.08 --> 2941.36]  Christians have received extravagant grace and so Christians give extravagant grace. The man in
[2941.36 --> 2949.90]  the parable doesn't forgive as he is forgiven and he ends up in jail. And then to underscore the point,
[2950.72 --> 2957.06]  Jesus says those, at least to me this morning, terrifying words, this is how you will be treated
[2957.06 --> 2968.96]  unless you forgive others from your heart. And so simply put, we need to get forgiveness right.
[2970.22 --> 2978.10]  Right? How we forgive others is a direct reflection on how we have experienced the forgiveness of God
[2978.10 --> 2985.02]  in Jesus and so it matters. Right? C.S. Lewis also says there is a straight line from the forgiveness
[2985.02 --> 2988.18]  that God has given you to the forgiveness you offer others.
[2992.14 --> 3001.42]  And so, in the time that we have left together, I want to walk you quickly through a theology of
[3001.42 --> 3008.62]  forgiveness. Right? Forgiveness for each other as defined by the gospel of Jesus, as defined by
[3008.62 --> 3015.68]  God forgiving us. And to do that, we're going to look under three quick headings. One, forgiveness as
[3015.68 --> 3023.44]  sacrifice. Two, forgiveness as carrying alone. And then three, forgiveness as discipline or decision.
[3024.46 --> 3028.26]  And so first, forgiveness as sacrifice.
[3028.26 --> 3058.24]  Forgiveness as sacrifice.
[3058.24 --> 3064.14]  If a person wrongs you, right? There's really only two sort of categories of response. You can make
[3064.14 --> 3069.72]  them suffer for the wrong. Right? You can make them pay for the damage. You can make them replace
[3069.72 --> 3074.36]  the broken item. Or you can make them pay through other means. You can make them suffer by destroying
[3074.36 --> 3080.36]  their credibility at work. You can make them pay by slandering them, by talking bad about them to your
[3080.36 --> 3084.92]  co-workers or to your friends. Right? If a person that does something that hurts you, you can make
[3084.92 --> 3092.12]  them pay by hurting them back. Right? By causing them to suffer. Or the other category of response
[3092.12 --> 3097.44]  is you can forgive them. Now, this is the more difficult path because in order for you to forgive
[3097.44 --> 3104.54]  them, it is you paying. Right? You are the one who is suffering. You are the one who is sacrificing your
[3104.54 --> 3113.40]  ability to retaliate, your desire for revenge, your want for justice. Right? When you so badly want to
[3113.40 --> 3119.82]  get revenge, forgiveness says that you let go of that claim. When you so badly want to be paid back
[3119.82 --> 3126.40]  for the hurt that was done you, forgiveness says that you absorb the loss. Right? If someone slanders
[3126.40 --> 3133.48]  you behind your back, if they talk crap about you, forgiveness says that you absorb it. Right? The
[3133.48 --> 3138.48]  debt of the wrong doesn't vanish here. Right? And nor does the fact that the thing done was wrong.
[3139.82 --> 3147.10]  Instead, it comes down to who's going to pay. You or the one who committed the offense.
[3148.28 --> 3156.08]  That's why forgiveness is so hard. But that's exactly the forgiveness of Jesus offered in the gospel.
[3156.40 --> 3163.98]  Right? Here, again, trying to be quick here, but in Mark 10, in Mark 10, Jesus says,
[3164.10 --> 3172.86]  for the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many.
[3174.16 --> 3180.26]  Right? He came to sacrifice himself. In John 10, Jesus says, I am the good shepherd. I know my sheep,
[3180.26 --> 3186.36]  and my sheep know me, just as the Father knows me, and I know the Father, and I lay my life down
[3186.36 --> 3194.04]  for the sheep. The reason the Father loves me, Jesus goes on, is that I lay my life down. No one
[3194.04 --> 3205.30]  takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. Jesus willingly sacrifices himself once for all so
[3205.30 --> 3214.94]  that we may be forgiven. His forgiveness required sacrifice. Your forgiving requires one too.
[3218.28 --> 3229.44]  Two, forgiveness is carrying alone. A few years ago, I read the book series Divergent by Veronica Roth.
[3229.44 --> 3232.44]  I don't know how many of you remember that. It was made into a movie. The movies weren't great.
[3233.72 --> 3241.26]  In the final book, called Allegiant, the main character, Tris, has had a, her brother, Caleb,
[3241.34 --> 3245.94]  has betrayed her to the authorities. It's a dystopian set in the future Chicago. Anyway,
[3246.64 --> 3253.32]  she has been betrayed by her brother, has been handed over to the authorities by him,
[3253.32 --> 3259.88]  and that has impacted their relationship. That's one of the subtexts through the story. Tris says
[3259.88 --> 3266.22]  in there, she says, to me, when someone wrongs you, you both share the burden of that wrongdoing.
[3266.22 --> 3274.16]  The pain of it weighs on both of you. Forgiveness, then, means choosing to bear the full weight all by
[3274.16 --> 3281.30]  yourself. She goes on, she says, Caleb's betrayal is something we both carry, and since he did it,
[3281.30 --> 3286.92]  all I've wanted is for him to take its weight away from me. I'm not sure I'm capable of shouldering it
[3286.92 --> 3292.38]  all by myself. I'm not sure that I'm strong enough or good enough, but I see him stealing himself
[3292.38 --> 3297.10]  against this fate, and I know that I have to be strong enough. I know that I have to be good enough.
[3300.70 --> 3307.18]  Forgiveness means carrying alone. Now, for Jesus, right, as we look at his life, carrying alone
[3307.18 --> 3315.40]  means that he is the only one through whom divine forgiveness can be accomplished, right? Again, in
[3315.40 --> 3322.28]  John, Jesus says, where I am going, you cannot come. He says, I'm the only one who can do this. In Mark,
[3322.80 --> 3329.52]  Jesus prays, Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me, yet not my will, but yours.
[3329.52 --> 3338.24]  Right? In Matthew, Jesus says, my God, my God, why have you forsaken me? And I am the way, the truth,
[3338.30 --> 3344.50]  and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. Right? In Acts 4, salvation is found
[3344.50 --> 3350.04]  in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved.
[3350.42 --> 3357.72]  Forgiveness in the gospel means only Jesus can do it. And so for us, as our understanding of
[3357.72 --> 3364.18]  forgiveness works itself out from the person of Jesus, right, forgiveness as carrying alone means
[3364.18 --> 3372.54]  deciding that the other person no longer has to share in your burden of the guilt, in carrying
[3372.54 --> 3378.96]  that together, in your projection of the pain. It means choosing to bear the full weight of that
[3378.96 --> 3390.84]  for that wrongdoing all by yourself. Now, let me be really abundantly, pastorally clear with you
[3390.84 --> 3397.52]  in this moment. Because, of course, it's actually not entirely true that forgiveness means we carry
[3397.52 --> 3402.92]  the entire load by ourselves. Right? It would be more accurate to say that forgiveness means we don't
[3402.92 --> 3411.68]  make the other person responsible for that action or hurt or wrongdoing anymore. Instead, we take that
[3411.68 --> 3418.32]  once shared burden of responsibility and we hold it ourselves just long enough to hand it over to Jesus.
[3420.70 --> 3428.60]  Right? Jesus says, come to me, all who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon
[3428.60 --> 3436.58]  you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
[3438.22 --> 3447.34]  Part of that rest is taking that burden of forgiveness and holding it and placing it on him.
[3447.34 --> 3458.50]  Then finally, and perhaps most difficult, forgiveness as discipline or as a decision.
[3459.40 --> 3463.38]  Here's why this one's so hard. Because for so many of us, and our culture affirms this,
[3463.80 --> 3472.20]  right, forgiveness is a feeling. And because it's a feeling, we don't really know if or when
[3472.20 --> 3477.18]  we've actually forgiven someone. Right? We say things like, I don't know if I can forgive them
[3477.18 --> 3484.66]  right now. Right? We say things like, I'm not sure if I've forgiven them. But let's quickly do a little
[3484.66 --> 3489.46]  another survey, because the Bible fills up for us this meaning of forgiveness. Listen to these. These
[3489.46 --> 3495.30]  ones will be on the screen, so you can follow along. Romans 12, 19. It says, do not take revenge,
[3495.30 --> 3500.62]  my dear friends, but leave room for God's wrath, for it is written, it is mine to avenge, I will repay,
[3500.62 --> 3509.40]  says the Lord. And so that means forgiveness is resisting revenge. 1 Thessalonians 5, 15. Make sure
[3509.40 --> 3514.38]  that nobody pays back wrong for wrong, but always strive to do what is good for each other and for
[3514.38 --> 3521.38]  everyone else. And so that means forgiveness is not doing wrong for wrong, not doing wrong in return.
[3522.60 --> 3528.88]  Instead, Luke 6, 28, bless those who curse you. So instead of doing wrong, forgiveness means wanting
[3528.88 --> 3536.14]  good for them, wanting blessing for them. Matthew 5, 44. But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for
[3536.14 --> 3544.10]  those who persecute you. And so forgiveness involves praying for them. Romans 12, 18. If it is possible,
[3544.20 --> 3549.96]  as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. And so forgiveness is seeking reconciliation,
[3549.96 --> 3558.86]  restoration, wholeness with them. And then finally, Exodus 23, 24. If you come across your enemy's ox or
[3558.86 --> 3566.08]  donkey wandering off, be sure to return it to them. And so forgiveness is being willing to come to their
[3566.08 --> 3573.92]  relief. Now notice, in all of these examples of what forgiveness looks like in the Bible, none of them
[3573.92 --> 3585.40]  are a simple feeling. Every one of them is an action, is a way of being, is a commitment to a certain way of
[3585.40 --> 3595.06]  living together, right? Forgiveness is a decision. Now it's a hard one, absolutely. And so perhaps it's better to
[3595.06 --> 3603.26]  call it a discipline. Forgiveness is a discipline. And Jesus understood this, right? He understood the decision.
[3603.26 --> 3609.54]  He says in John 3, just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up,
[3609.60 --> 3615.48]  that everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life. He goes on, I tell you the truth, unless a kernel
[3615.48 --> 3621.70]  of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds.
[3622.06 --> 3630.68]  Jesus knew the cost, and He still went forward to the cross. That was still His decision. Now again,
[3630.68 --> 3637.38]  notice what I'm not saying in all of this, okay? Forgiveness is not the absence of anger at sin.
[3638.66 --> 3645.94]  Forgiveness is not feeling good about what was bad, right? And forgiveness is not the absence of
[3645.94 --> 3656.92]  serious consequences for sin and for wrong choices. Instead, hear this. I like the way David Platt
[3656.92 --> 3664.02]  summarizes it. He says, the Bible is not saying that it is easy to forgive or even that it is natural
[3664.02 --> 3670.10]  to forgive. However, it is Christian to forgive.
[3672.66 --> 3678.70]  Forgiveness is a choice that we have to commit to living into over and over again. And it means
[3678.70 --> 3683.44]  choosing not to bring up past wrongs, choosing to love the person even when we don't feel like it.
[3683.44 --> 3690.66]  It means giving up revenge and coming to their relief. Look, here's the truth of this parable and
[3690.66 --> 3698.54]  of the gospel and of human life, that you can call yourself a Christian only because of the extravagant
[3698.54 --> 3708.86]  grace of God in Jesus. But you only live your life as a Christian when you offer the same grace to the
[3708.86 --> 3715.50]  people around you. Christians have received extravagant grace and so Christians give
[3715.50 --> 3729.48]  extravagant grace. You, me, doing the unfathomable and impossible thing of forgiving is a picture of
[3729.48 --> 3737.32]  the gospel. And maybe it's even the clearest picture that we can offer the world. And so over and over
[3737.32 --> 3744.48]  and over again, forgive. Because you are forgiven and so forgive.
[3746.70 --> 3751.12]  Now, I still remember what C.S. Lewis said, that everyone says forgiveness is a lovely idea until
[3751.12 --> 3761.12]  they have something to forgive. I know that this is hard. Yesterday, I came into this sanctuary and I've
[3761.12 --> 3772.18]  spent two and a half hours sitting in every single chair in this sanctuary and praying for you who are
[3772.18 --> 3778.20]  sitting there. For every single person who is here this morning and for you who are online and yes,
[3778.32 --> 3785.40]  you too, even at the back. I prayed in your place, sitting there, saying, merciful God,
[3785.40 --> 3794.16]  allow whoever sits here to experience the grace of your forgiveness and may they go from this place
[3794.16 --> 3802.14]  able and willing to offer the same. And then I moved to the next chair and prayed the same all the way
[3802.14 --> 3811.60]  through until I got there almost in tears. Because imagine, imagine that picture if you go from this
[3811.60 --> 3818.16]  place that way. Imagine what might change if you go from this place that way. Now, I know that it's
[3818.16 --> 3827.34]  still hard. And so to make that a little bit easier, if you reach under your chair, if you're sitting in
[3827.34 --> 3830.96]  the chairs, most of you on the right hand side of your chair, there will be a little piece of paper.
[3832.42 --> 3837.00]  Some of you, it will be more in the middle. Brandon, in the back corner there, it's on the left side
[3837.00 --> 3841.48]  because the chairs were difficult for me. You'll find a little piece of paper, carefully pull it out.
[3841.76 --> 3845.40]  You might have to lift the seat up just a bit, but there's a little piece of paper in there.
[3847.46 --> 3853.48]  That little piece of paper, Linda and Clarence, Linda, if you look under your keyboard, Clarence,
[3853.62 --> 3856.52]  the angle iron that's on the back of the table, there's one tucked under there.
[3857.24 --> 3858.06]  I thought of you too.
[3858.06 --> 3868.86]  On one side, it says, merciful God, I confess. And I challenge you. Take a pen and write a prayer
[3868.86 --> 3877.86]  of confession. And then flip it over. Loving Father, today I decide to forgive. And you write a name.
[3879.18 --> 3883.74]  And then you take this paper and you put it in your wallet or your pocket or your purse or wherever,
[3883.74 --> 3892.64]  in your car, somewhere. Because throughout this message, you have been feeling shame or guilt
[3892.64 --> 3897.68]  somewhere in your mind and you've been trying to push it away. Throughout this message, you have
[3897.68 --> 3902.60]  been thinking of a person but trying really hard not to think of them. Thinking of a situation but
[3902.60 --> 3906.30]  trying really hard to ignore it and pretend that, well, he's not talking about me. He's not talking
[3906.30 --> 3919.86]  about that. We are. Take this as a reminder that today, God the Father looks directly into your heart
[3919.86 --> 3934.82]  and he says, I forgive you. Son, I love you. I forgive you. Daughter, I love you and I forgive you.
[3935.80 --> 3945.06]  And take this as a reminder to live that love and to offer that same forgiveness. Go.
[3945.06 --> 3952.04]  So, forgiven and forgiving. Amen? Let's pray.
[3956.96 --> 3964.08]  Merciful God, hear the cries of our heart.
[3966.00 --> 3974.02]  Merciful God, speak words of love and life into the depths of our soul.
[3974.02 --> 3985.66]  Give us rest as we experience, maybe for the first time, maybe for a new time, your mercy and grace in
[3985.66 --> 3995.16]  forgiveness. And compel then by your mercy and grace, may we go and offer the same. May we go and live
[3995.16 --> 3996.70]  the same.
[3996.70 --> 4009.48]  Father God, by your grace, may we go and offer the same. May our
[4009.48 --> 4019.06]  family see. May our friends see. May our children see. May our brothers and sisters see. May strangers on the street see.
[4019.06 --> 4026.12]  May your kingdom come in our hearts just a little bit more this week.
[4027.80 --> 4031.78]  Jesus Christ, we pray and all God's people said. Amen.
[4031.78 --> 4031.94]  Amen.
[4031.94 --> 4031.98]  Amen.
[4031.98 --> 4032.04]  Amen.
[4032.04 --> 4035.98]  Amen.
[4035.98 --> 4037.98]  Amen.
[4037.98 --> 4039.98]  Amen.
[4039.98 --> 4041.98]  Amen.
[4041.98 --> 4043.98]  Amen.
[4043.98 --> 4045.98]  Amen.
[4045.98 --> 4046.04]  Amen.
[4046.04 --> 4046.08]  Amen.
[4046.08 --> 4046.62]  Amen.
[4046.62 --> 4046.68]  Amen.
[4046.68 --> 4046.72]  Amen.
[4046.72 --> 4046.76]  Amen.
[4046.76 --> 4046.78]  Amen.
[4046.78 --> 4046.82]  Amen.
[4049.06 --> 4073.82]  Amen.
[4077.82 --> 4078.66]  Amen.
[4078.66 --> 4078.72]  Amen.
[4078.72 --> 4082.38]  that burned within my heart
[4082.38 --> 4084.88]  has found him
[4084.88 --> 4087.54]  with an adoring heart
[4087.54 --> 4088.48]  has followed
[4088.48 --> 4093.48]  the paths of earthly wisdom
[4093.48 --> 4097.96]  if he for my unbelief
[4097.96 --> 4102.72]  renew the fire again
[4102.72 --> 4108.04]  Lord have mercy
[4108.04 --> 4112.36]  Christ have mercy
[4112.36 --> 4116.66]  Lord have mercy
[4116.66 --> 4120.56]  on me
[4120.56 --> 4125.12]  Lord have mercy
[4125.12 --> 4129.30]  Christ have mercy
[4129.30 --> 4133.28]  Lord have mercy
[4133.28 --> 4137.44]  on me
[4137.44 --> 4142.76]  I have built an altar
[4142.76 --> 4145.22]  where I worship
[4145.22 --> 4147.96]  the kingdom of heaven
[4147.96 --> 4150.76]  I have taken journeys
[4150.76 --> 4153.76]  that have gone before
[4153.76 --> 4154.76]  I have confused
[4154.76 --> 4159.08]  now I am returning
[4159.08 --> 4161.14]  through your mercy
[4161.14 --> 4164.54]  so that I have followed me
[4164.54 --> 4166.54]  heart of my trust
[4166.54 --> 4167.92]  I have mercy on you
[4167.92 --> 4172.92]  I have mercy on me
[4172.92 --> 4177.86]  Lord have mercy
[4177.86 --> 4181.86]  Christ have mercy
[4181.86 --> 4184.86]  Lord have mercy
[4184.86 --> 4189.18]  Lord have mercy on me
[4189.18 --> 4193.18]  Lord have mercy
[4193.18 --> 4193.48]  Lord have mercy
[4193.48 --> 4197.18]  Christ have mercy
[4197.18 --> 4201.18]  Lord have mercy
[4201.18 --> 4203.18]  on me
[4203.18 --> 4212.50]  I have mercy on me
[4212.50 --> 4215.56]  I have long to know you
[4215.56 --> 4228.88]  I have long to know you
[4228.88 --> 4233.20]  and all your tender mercy
[4233.20 --> 4234.52]  I have mercy on you
[4234.52 --> 4237.52]  Lord have mercy on me
[4237.52 --> 4239.58]  I have mercy on you
[4239.58 --> 4240.96]  Lord have mercy on you
[4240.96 --> 4249.96]  Christ have mercy on you
[4249.96 --> 4251.90]  Lord have mercy on you
[4251.90 --> 4253.90]  Lord have mercy on me
[4253.90 --> 4263.22]  Lord have mercy on me
[4263.22 --> 4265.22]  Lord have mercy on me

[4281.54 --> 4285.54]  Christ have mercy
[4285.54 --> 4293.54]  Lord have mercy on me
[4293.54 --> 4310.86]  Lord have mercy on me
[4310.86 --> 4314.80]  Lord have mercy
[4314.80 --> 4319.14]  Christ have mercy
[4319.14 --> 4331.14]  Lord have mercy on us
[4331.14 --> 4339.64]  As you go this week
[4339.64 --> 4341.50]  know that God himself
[4341.50 --> 4343.68]  goes with you
[4343.68 --> 4347.04]  and in his going with you
[4347.04 --> 4348.86]  he sustains you
[4348.86 --> 4350.22]  and holds you up
[4350.22 --> 4351.76]  for whatever it is
[4351.76 --> 4352.52]  you may face
[4352.52 --> 4353.92]  and so receive
[4353.92 --> 4355.92]  his blessing
[4355.92 --> 4359.18]  may God go before you
[4359.18 --> 4360.36]  to guide you
[4360.36 --> 4362.28]  God go behind you
[4362.28 --> 4362.98]  to guard you
[4362.98 --> 4364.28]  God go beneath you
[4364.28 --> 4365.30]  to support you
[4365.30 --> 4367.16]  and God go beside you
[4367.16 --> 4368.42]  to befriend you
[4368.42 --> 4370.48]  do not be afraid
[4370.48 --> 4372.02]  let the blessing of God
[4372.02 --> 4373.04]  come upon you today
[4373.04 --> 4374.86]  do not be afraid
[4374.86 --> 4376.66]  but go in peace
[4376.66 --> 4377.60]  forgiven
[4377.60 --> 4379.74]  to love
[4379.74 --> 4381.02]  and serve
[4381.02 --> 4382.02]  the Lord
[4382.02 --> 4383.88]  Amen
[4383.88 --> 4387.26]  Lord
[4387.26 --> 4402.42]  you are my shepherd
[4402.42 --> 4406.40]  you are my shepherd
[4406.40 --> 4408.62]  you make me lie
[4408.62 --> 4410.78] laughter
[4410.78 --> 4420.76]  and filled up
[4420.76 --> 4421.22]  You lead me by
[4421.22 --> 4422.96]  You lead me by
[4422.96 --> 4426.56]  God shall have puede
[4426.56 --> 4434.56]  For you are with me and you come for me
[4434.56 --> 4443.56]  Surely goodness, love and mercy will follow wherever I go
[4443.56 --> 4452.56]  Surely goodness, love and mercy will follow wherever I go
[4452.56 --> 4462.56]  Surely goodness, love and mercy will follow wherever I go
[4464.56 --> 4471.56]  Lord, you're my shepherd, you make me lie in the sea
[4471.56 --> 4480.56]  You lead me by the still waters, you reach your righteousness in me
[4480.56 --> 4488.56]  Though I walk through the valley, I will fear no evil thing
[4488.56 --> 4496.56]  For you are with me and you come for me
[4496.56 --> 4505.56]  Surely goodness, love and mercy will follow wherever I go
[4505.56 --> 4513.56]  Surely goodness, love and mercy will follow wherever I go
[4513.56 --> 4523.56]  Surely goodness, love and mercy will follow wherever I go
[4523.56 --> 4533.56]  I'm gonna dwell in the house of the Lord forever
[4533.56 --> 4539.56]  I'm gonna dwell in the house of the Lord forever
[4539.56 --> 4549.56]  I'm gonna dwell in the house of the Lord forever
[4549.56 --> 4559.56]  I'm gonna dwell in the house of the Lord forever
[4559.56 --> 4563.56]  I'm gonna dwell in the house of the Lord forever
[4563.56 --> 4573.56]  Surely goodness, love and mercy, will follow wherever I go
[4573.56 --> 4577.56]  Surely goodness, love and mercy will follow wherever I go
[4577.56 --> 4580.18]  God bless, love, and mercy
[4580.18 --> 4584.36]  We'll follow wherever I go
[4584.36 --> 4588.56]  Surely God bless, love, and mercy
[4588.56 --> 4593.56]  We'll follow wherever I go
