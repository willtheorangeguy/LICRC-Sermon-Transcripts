[0.00 → 6.36] And so we would just invite you to come. There's no cost to that. Rentals are available and included,
[6.36 → 11.62] so if you don't own skates or if, like me, your kids outgrow everything you buy them within six
[11.62 → 16.52] months, they have stuff there for you to use, skates and helmets and the like. And so please
[16.52 → 24.46] come on Boxing Day for Church Family Skate together. I think that's it. And so why don't
[24.46 → 30.36] we stand together as you're able and where you are. We can be ushered into God's presence for worship
[30.36 → 39.70] this morning. We gather together as the body of Christ, the church of Jesus, and God meets us
[39.70 → 46.02] here. He welcomes us into his presence with his greeting. Receive the greeting of God.
[47.22 → 53.62] Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son,
[53.62 → 59.22] and our Saviour through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[60.76 → 67.52] And I'm going to invite, I think it's the Forum family up to the front to light our Advent candle today.
[67.52 → 67.60] Amen.
[83.62 → 99.52] Advent is the season of waiting, waiting for light in the darkness, waiting to be filled while empty,
[100.22 → 102.26] waiting for the return of the King.
[104.44 → 112.02] The Apostle Paul tells us that all creation is groaning under the weight of sin. The brokenness
[112.02 → 122.84] of the world is not just a sense we live with. Increasingly it is visible around us. What is visible
[122.84 → 131.02] now reflects the truth we all have felt. Something isn't right. We are not complete. We long to be made
[131.02 → 135.78] whole again and for the whole creation to be made new.
[135.78 → 142.40] Living in anticipation of the return of the King invites us to be a people of patience, endurance,
[142.40 → 148.10] and faith who can live rejoicing in the world to come and with deep joy in the world that is,
[148.36 → 154.00] holding on to the love that holds on to us, living it boldly, longing for the day when everything will
[154.00 → 154.68] be made whole.
[154.68 → 163.48] We light this candle as a reminder of the peace, the shalom and wholeness that we are all waiting
[163.48 → 169.56] for and towards which history is constantly moving as we await the full revealing of the
[169.56 → 171.00] kingdom of God come.
[188.38 → 195.88] The groaning of the world is loud. The darkness is deep. Into the chaos and confusion, Jesus speaks
[195.88 → 200.70] with the Clarín call. I am the light of the world. You'll be a light to the world.
[200.70 → 200.78] Amen.
[225.88 → 235.88] mix it up with the55 cup, beds on the Lord.
[235.88 → 236.88] Amen.
[265.88 → 267.88] Amen.
[295.88 → 296.88] Amen.
[325.88 → 326.88] Amen.
[355.88 → 356.88] Amen.
[385.88 → 386.88] Amen.
[415.88 → 416.88] Amen.
[445.88 → 446.88] Amen.
[475.88 → 476.88] Amen.
[505.88 → 506.88] Amen.
[535.88 → 536.88] Amen.
[565.88 → 566.88] Amen.
[595.88 → 596.88] Amen.
[625.88 → 626.88] Amen.
[626.88 → 627.88] Amen.
[627.88 → 628.88] Amen.
[628.88 → 629.88] Amen.
[629.88 → 630.88] Amen.
[630.88 → 631.88] Amen.
[631.88 → 632.88] Amen.
[632.88 → 634.88] Amen.
[634.88 → 635.88] Amen.
[635.88 → 636.88] Amen.
[636.88 → 637.88] Amen.
[637.88 → 638.88] Amen.
[638.88 → 639.88] Amen.
[639.88 → 640.88] Amen.
[640.88 → 642.88] You may be seated.
[642.88 → 654.88] As we heard in the Advent reading Jesus calling out, I am the light of the world.
[654.88 → 661.40] world. You will be a light to the world. In Matthew 5, Jesus says this to us, you are the light of the
[661.40 → 666.78] world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under
[666.78 → 672.66] a bowl. Instead, they put it on its stand and give its light to everyone in the house. And in the
[672.66 → 678.18] same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your
[678.18 → 684.22] Father in heaven. In the brokenness of the world, we are to be his light. In the deep darkness of
[684.22 → 690.78] this world, we are to be his light. And in the chaos and in the confusion, we are to be his light.
[692.14 → 696.90] The line that really caught my eye was, let your light shine before others.
[697.98 → 703.62] There are days when I don't feel like being his light. It's pretty easy to be intimidated by the
[703.62 → 709.96] darkness. And it begs the question, do we trust our Father enough to be placed on that lamp stand
[709.96 → 716.08] to shine into the chaos? I think it's only by the power of the Holy Spirit living within us,
[716.72 → 722.44] shining the light of Jesus through us, we can do the things that God has prepared for us
[722.44 → 725.20] as we wait for our King's return.
[726.52 → 727.82] Let's bow our heads.
[727.82 → 736.94] Father, you call us to be your light in this world, bringing your light to all those around us.
[737.86 → 742.20] Forgive us for not wanting to be that light in the presence of such chaos and brokenness.
[743.02 → 745.16] Forgive us for being intimidated by the darkness.
[746.48 → 752.52] Help us to trust in your power to overcome the chaos and to shine your light into the darkness.
[752.52 → 757.50] Let us experience your deep, deep love.
[758.60 → 763.56] Show us again how to become your presence in this broken world we live in.
[765.30 → 774.14] We want to shine your peace, your shalom, as we rest in your love, waiting for your return.
[776.04 → 776.32] Amen.
[777.60 → 780.38] Shall we rise and sing, O come?
[780.38 → 810.36] O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant,
[810.36 → 840.34] O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant, O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant, O come, let us adore him.
[840.34 → 843.34] Let us adore him.
[843.34 → 847.34] Rise, O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant, O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant, O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant.
[847.34 → 858.32] Sing, choirs of angels, sing in exultation,
[858.32 → 868.46] Sing, all ye citizens of heaven above.
[868.46 → 877.78] Glory to God all, glory in the highest,
[877.78 → 887.08] O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him,
[887.08 → 896.56] O come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord.
[896.56 → 906.26] Say, Lord, we greet thee, for this happy morning,
[907.16 → 920.42] Jesus, to thee be all glory in the Word of the Father,
[920.42 → 929.82] Now in flesh appearing, O come, let us adore Him,
[929.82 → 939.52] O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him,
[939.52 → 944.22] Christ the Lord.
[944.22 → 954.80] O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him,
[954.80 → 964.52] O come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord.
[964.52 → 989.02] O come, let us adore Him,
[989.02 → 994.22] Don't drop a single anchor, we're almost home,
[994.22 → 999.42] Through every soil and danger, we're almost home,
[999.42 → 1004.04] How many pilgrims sing, standing for us,
[1004.04 → 1008.64] Rode, let us talk to now, we're almost home.
[1008.64 → 1017.84] The promised land is calling, we're almost home,
[1017.84 → 1022.98] And God at sea shall fall, then we're almost home,
[1022.98 → 1028.16] They crave now your souls, for that peace thou come,
[1028.16 → 1032.34] They'll turn it back, we're almost home,
[1032.34 → 1038.24] From those homes, we're almost home,
[1038.24 → 1044.64] Oh, praise the Lord, we're almost home,
[1044.64 → 1048.64] We're almost home,
[1048.64 → 1053.84] As journeys are together, we're almost home,
[1053.84 → 1059.04] But to thy grave forever, we're almost home,
[1059.04 → 1064.04] The songs that you will sing, that the God they grow,
[1064.04 → 1069.04] How a faith of heart, we're almost home,
[1069.04 → 1077.44] If life is just a vapour, we're almost home,
[1077.44 → 1082.44] That sun is setting yonder, we're almost home,
[1082.44 → 1087.44] Take courage for this darkness, shall break to dawn,
[1087.44 → 1091.84] Oh, praise the Lord, we're almost home,
[1091.84 → 1095.84] Almost home, we're almost home,
[1095.84 → 1099.84] So press one, two, and bless the shore,
[1099.84 → 1104.24] Oh, praise the Lord, we're almost home,
[1104.24 → 1106.24] We're almost home,
[1106.24 → 1110.24] Almost home, we're almost home,
[1110.24 → 1112.24] So press one, two, and bless the shore,
[1112.24 → 1114.24] Oh, praise the Lord, we're almost home,
[1114.24 → 1118.64] We're almost home.
[1118.64 → 1148.62] Thank you.
[1148.64 → 1162.32] Light of the world, you step down into darkness. Open my eyes, let me see.
[1163.54 → 1173.90] Beauty that made this heart adore you. Home of our lives spent with you.
[1173.90 → 1187.40] Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down, here I am to say that you're my call.
[1187.86 → 1197.90] You're altogether lonely, altogether worthy, altogether wonderful to me.
[1197.90 → 1212.90] King of all days, you're so highly exalted, glorious in heaven above.
[1212.90 → 1223.90] Only you came to the earth you created. All for love's sake became whole.
[1223.90 → 1237.32] Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down, here I am to say that you're my God.
[1237.32 → 1248.32] You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy, altogether wonderful to me.
[1248.32 → 1259.32] And I'll never know how much it calls to see my sin upon that cross.
[1259.32 → 1263.32] You're altogether lovely, altogether lovely.
[1263.32 → 1271.32] All for love's sake, here I am to bow down, here I am to say that you're my God.
[1271.32 → 1285.16] So here I am to worship, here I am to bow down, here I am to say that you're my God.
[1285.16 → 1296.16] You're altogether lovely, altogether lovely, altogether lovely, altogether lovely, altogether wonderful to me.
[1296.16 → 1307.16] Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down, here I am to say that you're my God.
[1307.16 → 1322.00] Here I am to worship, here I am to worship, here I am to worship, here I am to worship, here I am to worship, here I am to visit more.
[1322.62 → 1323.32] tail anymore.
[1323.32 → 1325.32] • Lord, Lord, to worship, here increase our state of salvation can come and give good fruit to me.
[1325.32 → 1344.28] Good morning.
[1345.22 → 1349.32] My name is Emo, and I'm a deacon at Emmanuel.
[1350.14 → 1353.58] We continue our worship with the giving of our gifts
[1353.58 → 1358.84] for the budget, which covers the administration of the church
[1358.84 → 1362.24] and its ministries, and the special offering,
[1362.72 → 1364.92] which is Union Gospel Mission, this morning.
[1365.84 → 1369.44] It was established in 1940 in Vancouver.
[1371.98 → 1377.40] It's a charitable organization providing meals, education, shelter,
[1378.48 → 1382.58] safe and affordable housing, drug and alcohol recovery programs,
[1382.58 → 1387.98] and support services to those struggling with homelessness and addiction
[1387.98 → 1392.98] in Vancouver, New West, and the City of Mission.
[1393.86 → 1398.40] Its mission is to restore the God-given dignity of people
[1398.40 → 1402.44] by sharing and demonstrating the love of Jesus Christ,
[1403.14 → 1405.84] providing them, without discrimination,
[1405.84 → 1410.84] meals, shelter, outreach, and chaplaincy services
[1410.84 → 1413.70] that relieve suffering and renew hope.
[1414.88 → 1417.88] As Christians, we cannot ignore the poverty, addictions,
[1418.04 → 1421.30] and homelessness that are present in our communities.
[1421.88 → 1424.50] In donating to Union Gospel Mission,
[1424.98 → 1427.22] we help those who are in the greatest need.
[1427.22 → 1433.48] Some examples of the magnitude of their efforts are in 2021,
[1433.48 → 1440.24] there were 28,362 nights of emergency shelter given,
[1441.24 → 1447.00] 275,000 meals served, 69 housing units found,
[1447.82 → 1453.08] 27 alcohol and drug recovery graduates, and 33 jobs found.
[1453.08 → 1457.28] On December 1st at Union Gospel Mission,
[1457.82 → 1461.84] they served their 82nd Christmas meal
[1461.84 → 1464.68] to people on the downtown east side
[1464.68 → 1469.86] and served 3,500 to 4,000 meals that day.
[1470.66 → 1471.66] Please give generously.
[1472.84 → 1476.24] Do not neglect to do good and to share what you have,
[1476.70 → 1479.40] for such sacrifices are pleasing to God.
[1480.04 → 1481.96] Hebrews 13, verse 16.
[1481.96 → 1485.46] Next week's offering is for the budget only.
[1485.46 → 1485.96] Thank you.
[1485.96 → 1512.96] The shepherds came to see the baby
[1512.96 → 1516.96] To find His blood inside
[1516.96 → 1521.96] Here laid the Saviour inside a manger
[1521.96 → 1525.96] Oh, what a glorious night
[1525.96 → 1530.96] Oh, what a glorious night
[1530.96 → 1534.96] I hear the angels singing
[1534.96 → 1540.96] Hallelujah, let the earth receive her King
[1540.96 → 1543.96] I know that love has come
[1543.96 → 1545.96] Sing it out
[1545.96 → 1549.96] Jesus Christ is born
[1549.96 → 1554.96] I hear that Jesus Christ is born
[1554.96 → 1565.96] The shepherds wondered
[1565.96 → 1567.96] They couldn't hide it
[1567.96 → 1571.96] Told everyone in time
[1571.96 → 1574.96] All where else they'd send
[1574.96 → 1576.96] They could not find Him
[1576.96 → 1580.96] Down on the glorious night
[1580.96 → 1584.96] I hear that God came down on the glorious night
[1584.96 → 1587.96] The angels singing
[1587.96 → 1593.96] Hallelujah, let the earth receive her King
[1593.96 → 1596.96] I know that love has come
[1596.96 → 1598.96] Sing it out
[1598.96 → 1602.96] Jesus Christ is born
[1602.96 → 1607.96] I hear that Jesus Christ is born
[1607.96 → 1616.96] Glorious, glorious
[1616.96 → 1620.96] What a glorious night
[1620.96 → 1625.96] Glorious, glorious
[1625.96 → 1628.96] What a glorious night
[1628.96 → 1629.96] What a glorious night
[1629.96 → 1631.96] I hear the angels singing
[1631.96 → 1637.96] Hallelujah, let the earth receive her King
[1637.96 → 1640.96] I know that love has come
[1640.96 → 1642.96] Sing it out
[1642.96 → 1643.96] Jesus Christ is born
[1643.96 → 1644.96] Sing it out
[1644.96 → 1645.96] Jesus Christ is born
[1645.96 → 1647.96] Sing it out
[1647.96 → 1650.96] I hear that Jesus Christ is born
[1650.96 → 1654.96] I hear that Jesus Christ is born
[1654.96 → 1657.96] I hear that Jesus Christ is born
[1657.96 → 1659.56] has come
[1659.56 → 1661.90] sing it out
[1661.90 → 1664.00] Jesus Christ
[1664.00 → 1665.66] is born
[1665.66 → 1667.46] Jesus
[1667.46 → 1670.04] Christ is born
[1687.96 → 1697.44] All is calm now, all is quiet, a storm shines in us blind.
[1698.32 → 1711.16] We know in Bethlehem the King is sleeping, oh what a glorious night, oh what a glorious night.
[1717.96 → 1732.12] Hello, hello, can you guys move a tad bit back?
[1732.12 → 1734.56] I don't want to step on your nice boots.
[1734.56 → 1739.40] If you are a child between age three and up to grade four or anyone else, and you haven't
[1739.40 → 1742.40] come up, please come and join us at the front.
[1742.40 → 1745.00] Do you guys see that?
[1745.00 → 1748.24] Someone behind me said that it looks like a snow globe outside right now.
[1748.24 → 1750.24] Take a little peek out the window over there.
[1750.24 → 1752.24] It is like a snow globe.
[1752.24 → 1755.92] Yeah, God took the world, and you gave it a nice shake and now the snow is floating down.
[1755.92 → 1757.48] It's very pretty.
[1757.48 → 1759.76] I have something that you probably don't know.
[1759.76 → 1761.76] Do you want to know what it is?
[1761.76 → 1762.76] Yeah.
[1762.76 → 1764.76] It's Christmas break.
[1764.76 → 1766.76] Yeah, I actually knew that.
[1766.76 → 1767.76] You knew that?
[1767.76 → 1768.76] Did all of you guys know that?
[1768.76 → 1769.76] Yeah.
[1769.76 → 1770.76] You knew that too?
[1770.76 → 1771.76] No.
[1771.76 → 1772.76] It's Christmas break.
[1772.76 → 1773.76] Not my Christmas.
[1773.76 → 1775.32] What's your Christmas break?
[1775.32 → 1778.32] Well, for some people it's Christmas break which means you get a little time off from
[1778.32 → 1784.88] school, and you probably have some extra fun events happening as we get ready for Christmas.
[1784.88 → 1789.00] And for Kids Corner we've been reading this book called The Lightings.
[1789.00 → 1791.00] Lightings, not The Lightings.
[1791.00 → 1792.00] The Lightings.
[1792.00 → 1797.60] And we've learned that these lightings were created to live in the light maker's light,
[1797.60 → 1800.00] but then they decided not to listen to him.
[1800.00 → 1802.00] Do you remember that happened a few weeks ago?
[1802.00 → 1806.00] And today we're just going to read a really short part about what happens next.
[1806.00 → 1809.56] So, I'll read it, and then I'll show you the picture.
[1809.56 → 1814.78] Then one night, or perhaps it was day far off in the distance, they saw a blinding light
[1814.78 → 1816.24] shining through the trees.
[1816.24 → 1820.12] They could see the light coming from miles and miles away, and they were frightened by
[1820.12 → 1821.12] it.
[1821.12 → 1825.28] They thought that the light meant the king was coming to find them and punish them for their
[1825.28 → 1826.28] sins.
[1826.28 → 1831.84] So, most of the lightings began to stumble quickly away from the light.
[1831.84 → 1833.84] They're lightings.
[1833.84 → 1837.84] So, lightings are these little people in the story.
[1837.84 → 1842.42] But some of the lighting children were so amazed by the light and curious about it that they
[1842.42 → 1845.84] decided to see from where it was coming.
[1845.84 → 1848.40] They set off and travelled for miles and miles.
[1848.40 → 1854.98] It took them a long time, but as they moved, they saw the light shining brighter and brighter.
[1854.98 → 1868.54] So, I'm going to go ahead and see what they find on Christmas.
[1868.54 → 1873.26] If you come on Christmas Day, we'll finish off the story up here.
[1873.26 → 1877.22] We are going to go talk about some more messages that God has for us and what we can do with
[1877.22 → 1880.54] those messages in our large group and our children's worship time.
[1880.54 → 1885.74] So, let's stand up first and offer our blessing to the rest of the church and receive their
[1885.74 → 1886.86] blessings back.
[1886.86 → 1889.26] I'm going to sing.
[1889.26 → 1890.86] Alright.
[1890.86 → 1893.22] The Lord be with you.
[1910.54 → 1934.42] I guess it's on.
[1934.42 → 1943.30] When I finished making coffee, then I went to where we always meet as council and we
[1943.30 → 1945.74] pray for the service.
[1945.74 → 1949.20] And I didn't make it in because I was a little bit late.
[1949.20 → 1951.24] But I was told I had to pray.
[1951.24 → 1952.24] But I knew that.
[1952.24 → 1954.70] So, it wasn't all bad.
[1954.70 → 1958.08] There are two things that strike me always.
[1958.08 → 1965.48] Mostly, by people who always have opinions of the church or the people that go to church.
[1965.48 → 1969.32] And the one thing is they always want your money.
[1969.32 → 1972.96] And the second thing is the church is full of hypocrites.
[1972.96 → 1977.96] And I'd like to just say a few things about both of those things.
[1977.96 → 1981.96] Number one, the church does not want all your money.
[1981.96 → 1984.48] But it certainly needs some of it.
[1984.48 → 1990.36] And that's why, as we get to the end of the year, it helps a lot if we do our part.
[1990.36 → 1992.96] Second one, the church is full of hypocrites.
[1992.96 → 1995.28] I'm here to say that that's 100% true.
[1995.28 → 1996.92] I'm one of them.
[1996.92 → 2000.06] And if you're perfect, no need to attend.
[2000.06 → 2002.06] Shall we pray?
[2002.06 → 2007.62] Father, Lord, in heaven, Lord, thank you.
[2007.62 → 2010.96] Thank you that we can be amongst believers.
[2010.96 → 2013.28] Thank you that we can hear your word.
[2013.28 → 2016.36] Thank you that we can worship with others.
[2016.36 → 2020.08] Thank you that we have somewhere to go, Lord, because a lot of the world does not.
[2020.08 → 2023.08] A lot of the world does not even have your word.
[2023.08 → 2026.30] They can't even openly read it as we can.
[2026.30 → 2030.78] Lord, thank you for the blessings of this season.
[2030.78 → 2033.20] Thank you for your son.
[2033.20 → 2036.24] Thank you that you came down for us, for each one of us, Lord.
[2036.24 → 2038.98] Thank you that you know each one of us by name.
[2038.98 → 2041.30] You knew that before we even had our name.
[2041.30 → 2042.30] Thank you.
[2042.30 → 2045.30] All the days for us, you knew.
[2045.30 → 2053.30] Lord, we pray this morning, especially for the people that have left us.
[2053.30 → 2055.30] Lord, that is so hard.
[2055.30 → 2058.10] We have somebody we love.
[2058.10 → 2060.10] We have to say goodbye.
[2060.10 → 2063.42] Sometimes we know that and sometimes we don't.
[2063.42 → 2064.42] Lord, we know where they are.
[2064.42 → 2066.42] We know whose hands they are in.
[2066.42 → 2074.42] But we still have that empty chair, that empty seat.
[2074.42 → 2079.42] Lord, we pray will you be with the families that have had to say goodbye.
[2079.42 → 2087.42] Lord, we thank you also for people today now that have had operations, and it's been successful.
[2087.42 → 2091.74] We pray will you be with them as they recuperate.
[2091.74 → 2096.10] We pray will you be with people who have just heard news, maybe not so nice news, Lord,
[2096.10 → 2101.74] that they have something that they have to go for tests, or they have to go for treatments
[2101.74 → 2102.74] or whatever it is.
[2102.74 → 2103.30] Lord, you know.
[2103.30 → 2111.98] Help us to know, each one of us, that we are totally in your hands and each day you have
[2111.98 → 2115.98] already accounted for us.
[2115.98 → 2117.98] Lord, how is that even possible?
[2117.98 → 2122.62] Lord, thank you.
[2122.62 → 2125.98] Lord, we thank you for the school break.
[2125.98 → 2127.98] We thank you for the break for the teachers.
[2127.98 → 2136.66] Lord, we pray will you be with us as we work at home or work elsewhere, or we go to school.
[2136.66 → 2140.98] Lord, we pray for the families that are meeting together this holiday season.
[2140.98 → 2143.98] We pray for the people who can't.
[2143.98 → 2150.98] Lord, we pray will you touch us and will you help us to know that you're right there.
[2150.98 → 2154.98] Lord, thank you for all the blessings.
[2154.98 → 2158.98] Lord, we live in a place that we don't deserve.
[2158.98 → 2164.98] We have more than enough, most of us, not all of us.
[2164.98 → 2169.78] Lord, it's easy to drive by somebody on the street and feel sorry.
[2169.78 → 2173.66] What do we do?
[2173.66 → 2177.50] Lord, we pray this morning for your word.
[2177.50 → 2184.50] We pray will you be with the leaders of our city, of our province, of our country, of
[2184.50 → 2185.50] the world.
[2185.50 → 2189.50] Lord, nobody has a job unless you allow it to happen.
[2189.50 → 2191.50] And Lord, we wonder why sometimes.
[2191.50 → 2192.50] We truly wonder.
[2192.50 → 2196.50] But we are all in your hands, and we thank you for that, Lord, because we know that is
[2196.50 → 2197.50] so true.
[2197.50 → 2199.50] Help us to trust and obey.
[2199.50 → 2200.50] Help us to hear your word.
[2200.50 → 2202.50] Help us to enjoy this season.
[2202.50 → 2204.50] Thank you for your love and care.
[2204.50 → 2205.50] In Jesus' name we pray.
[2205.50 → 2209.50] All right.
[2209.50 → 2235.22] We're going to take some time and open God's Word together.
[2235.88 → 2238.56] We're going to do that in Revelation 22.
[2239.50 → 2247.26] And so if you don't know where that is, open your Bible to the last page, and then that's where you are.
[2248.10 → 2251.16] Revelation 22, last chapter in the Bible.
[2251.70 → 2256.66] If you use a device to the Bible, then you don't have to open it to the last page.
[2256.80 → 2258.42] You just type it in, and there it is.
[2259.58 → 2262.10] In just a moment, I'm going to read.
[2262.10 → 2272.42] But before we do, I just want to acknowledge, as we sit here, it's a little bit awkward because that stupid fan keeps making that whirly noise.
[2272.66 → 2277.56] And that only happens when the wind blows from just the right direction, and we have fixed it like six times.
[2279.16 → 2280.50] Sixty times.
[2280.50 → 2288.06] That said, Eric Hubert, are you here?
[2288.90 → 2289.94] All right, here's the challenge.
[2290.34 → 2294.14] If we make budget by the end of this year, the first thing that gets fixed next year is this.
[2295.60 → 2296.34] Oh, applause.
[2296.46 → 2296.90] Look at that.
[2296.90 → 2299.50] All right.
[2300.34 → 2305.58] I'm going to ask that you, even if you hear that, right, that you just push through.
[2305.70 → 2310.40] I'll do my best maybe to talk loud enough where appropriate that it drowns it out.
[2310.94 → 2313.66] But it's not always going to be appropriate for me to be yelling at you.
[2314.02 → 2315.18] So you might hear it again.
[2315.82 → 2316.90] Let's just press through.
[2316.90 → 2323.92] We've been in this series, this Advent coming into Christmas, in the book of Revelation,
[2323.92 → 2334.12] and we continue the last Sunday of Advent, the Sunday before Christmas, by looking at the end.
[2334.86 → 2336.00] Revelation 22.
[2336.30 → 2339.04] I'm going to read the first seven verses.
[2342.32 → 2346.84] Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life.
[2346.90 → 2349.64] As clear as crystal.
[2350.64 → 2355.72] Flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb down the middle of the great street of the city.
[2356.68 → 2364.60] On each side of the river stood the tree of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit, yielding its fruit every month.
[2365.06 → 2368.50] And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.
[2369.54 → 2371.84] No longer will there be any curse.
[2371.84 → 2374.86] The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city,
[2374.86 → 2377.36] and His servants will serve Him.
[2378.54 → 2382.82] They will see His face, and His name will be on their foreheads.
[2383.66 → 2384.92] There will be no more night.
[2385.66 → 2388.62] They will not need the light of the lamp or the light of the sun,
[2388.74 → 2391.52] for the Lord God will give them light,
[2391.60 → 2395.58] and they will reign forever and ever.
[2395.58 → 2398.54] The angel said to me,
[2398.54 → 2401.84] these words are trustworthy and true.
[2402.64 → 2405.56] The Lord, the God who inspires the prophets,
[2405.82 → 2410.78] sent His angel to show His servant the things that must soon take place.
[2411.82 → 2414.82] Look, I am coming soon.
[2415.88 → 2421.96] Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy written in this scroll.
[2421.96 → 2424.52] This is the word of the Lord.
[2428.88 → 2434.96] When I was a kid, there was a movie that, by the time I was able to watch it,
[2434.98 → 2438.00] had already garnered a bit of a cult following.
[2439.18 → 2441.10] This movie is called The Karate Kid.
[2442.32 → 2443.16] Some of you know it.
[2443.28 → 2444.92] I mean, if you're old enough, you remember it.
[2444.98 → 2446.20] It came out in 1984.
[2446.20 → 2449.52] I didn't watch it until sometime in the mid-90s.
[2449.84 → 2453.04] In 1984, I was one, so you shouldn't be watching anyway.
[2453.72 → 2457.44] Sometime in the 90s, I watched it, and I fell in love with the story.
[2457.96 → 2459.18] Now, if you don't know the story,
[2459.36 → 2462.10] and actually probably most of you do, even if you're younger,
[2462.24 → 2464.18] because in the last couple of years,
[2464.28 → 2466.50] YouTube read and then Netflix took it
[2466.50 → 2470.16] and relaunched like a continuation, right, in Cobra Kai.
[2470.84 → 2475.92] Anyway, the original story is about a young boy named Daniel LaRusso
[2475.92 → 2478.76] who moves to a new school, and at this new school,
[2478.86 → 2481.34] he's confronted by a group of bullies,
[2481.44 → 2484.22] and they look exactly like bullies did in the 80s, right?
[2484.26 → 2485.92] You all know exactly what I'm talking about.
[2487.10 → 2488.86] And he's confronted by this group of bullies,
[2488.92 → 2489.74] and he runs away.
[2490.14 → 2491.10] They catch up to him.
[2491.14 → 2491.68] They attack him.
[2491.68 → 2497.04] And then this old man, who's the gardener at Daniel LaRusso's house,
[2497.52 → 2499.20] comes, and he breaks up the fight.
[2499.20 → 2500.56] His name is Mr. Miami,
[2501.00 → 2504.12] and it turns out he is an expert in karate.
[2505.22 → 2509.40] And so Daniel LaRusso wants to get trained by Mr. Miami,
[2509.96 → 2511.56] and so he goes to him, and he says,
[2511.64 → 2512.76] can you show me what you did?
[2512.80 → 2514.44] And so he says, okay, yes.
[2514.64 → 2516.12] And he begins to train him,
[2516.40 → 2519.72] except what Daniel ends up having to do, right,
[2519.78 → 2522.42] is he has to learn how to paint the fence.
[2524.42 → 2527.18] And then he has to learn how to paint the house.
[2527.18 → 2530.16] Okay, I'm not going to stop doing that, right?
[2530.22 → 2532.58] But he also has to learn how to sand the floors.
[2533.22 → 2538.98] Then, famously, he has to wax on, wax off.
[2539.04 → 2541.82] Okay, there's at least three other people here who remember this story.
[2543.28 → 2543.40] Right?
[2543.52 → 2545.56] Daniel doesn't understand what's happening,
[2545.86 → 2548.28] and he feels like he's being taken advantage of,
[2548.32 → 2552.20] and that he's just doing these household chores for this weird old man,
[2552.20 → 2554.24] and it doesn't make sense.
[2555.32 → 2555.44] Right?
[2555.48 → 2556.54] So he gets frustrated,
[2556.94 → 2559.22] and he questions the purpose of it all.
[2560.94 → 2563.50] Now, I don't want to take that as a bit of a metaphor.
[2564.94 → 2565.12] Right?
[2565.16 → 2566.94] He couldn't see the bigger picture,
[2567.62 → 2570.92] and he didn't see how these smaller exercises
[2570.92 → 2576.36] were training related to other different exercises.
[2576.36 → 2579.74] He couldn't see the big picture,
[2580.28 → 2582.00] and so he grew frustrated.
[2583.04 → 2583.60] Right?
[2583.64 → 2585.26] He couldn't see the big picture,
[2585.48 → 2588.94] and so in the face of the trials that were happening,
[2589.40 → 2590.64] he got angry.
[2592.12 → 2595.50] And then eventually, because he didn't know him well,
[2595.80 → 2600.86] he didn't trust Mr. Miami as the teacher and as the expert.
[2600.86 → 2600.98] Right?
[2603.08 → 2605.70] And there's a parable here for us, right?
[2605.72 → 2608.64] That when you lose sight of the big picture,
[2609.32 → 2612.82] what's right in front of you becomes all-consuming.
[2614.08 → 2614.18] Right?
[2614.22 → 2615.18] It's a mixed metaphor.
[2615.40 → 2617.58] When you lose sight of the forest, right,
[2617.66 → 2620.52] all you see is the bark on that one tree
[2620.52 → 2621.90] that's right in front of your eyes,
[2622.02 → 2624.98] and you know that bark intimately well,
[2625.04 → 2629.24] and every groove and crevice in it makes you angry,
[2629.24 → 2632.70] because it's all you see.
[2633.68 → 2634.96] And we'll continue that, right?
[2634.98 → 2637.20] If you can't see the bigger picture,
[2637.48 → 2639.64] and you don't trust the teacher,
[2639.76 → 2641.52] the one who's showing it to you,
[2642.14 → 2644.00] right, you get frustrated.
[2644.82 → 2647.88] But if you don't have a relationship with the teacher,
[2648.60 → 2650.60] it's very hard, maybe even impossible,
[2651.40 → 2652.12] to trust him.
[2654.40 → 2655.96] This Advent and Christmas,
[2656.66 → 2658.24] in our series here,
[2658.24 → 2660.38] we've been looking at the book of Revelation,
[2660.56 → 2663.54] and we have been trying to open our eyes
[2663.54 → 2664.78] to the bigger picture,
[2665.08 → 2666.52] and the one who is painting it.
[2667.80 → 2670.04] Advent is a season both of looking back,
[2670.34 → 2671.54] and of looking forward.
[2672.14 → 2674.44] It's a season of waiting for Christ to come
[2674.44 → 2676.10] as a child in the manger,
[2676.28 → 2678.58] and a season of waiting for Christ to come
[2678.58 → 2682.26] as king heralded by the sound of angels' trumpets.
[2682.26 → 2685.50] And because life right now,
[2685.64 → 2686.50] here and now,
[2686.64 → 2687.10] today,
[2687.18 → 2688.56] can be so hard,
[2688.80 → 2690.14] and so full of chaos,
[2690.40 → 2691.46] and so full of suffering,
[2691.66 → 2692.24] and challenges,
[2692.36 → 2693.30] so full of frustration,
[2693.52 → 2695.66] sometimes it's really hard to see
[2695.66 → 2696.78] the big picture.
[2697.82 → 2700.12] And because our hearts are fickle,
[2700.18 → 2701.76] and we wander away,
[2701.96 → 2704.62] it's hard to keep a relationship with God
[2704.62 → 2706.44] strong and vital,
[2706.44 → 2708.22] like we really believe,
[2708.38 → 2709.94] and know that it should be.
[2711.08 → 2711.66] And so,
[2712.56 → 2714.08] in our time together,
[2714.48 → 2717.36] we have been focusing our hearts,
[2717.58 → 2718.98] and our imaginations,
[2719.62 → 2722.48] on the return of the king.
[2722.48 → 2725.76] And with our eyes open
[2725.76 → 2728.40] to the truth of what is happening around us,
[2728.44 → 2731.30] and to the truth of what will yet come,
[2731.44 → 2733.56] to the truth of the return of the king,
[2733.70 → 2735.66] we have been trying to live
[2735.66 → 2738.68] in anticipation of his return.
[2739.98 → 2741.62] And that's been our theme, right?
[2741.66 → 2744.00] We read it every time when we do candles,
[2744.14 → 2745.30] we hear it here.
[2745.44 → 2748.58] Living in anticipation of the return of the king
[2748.58 → 2751.48] calls us to be a people of patient,
[2751.48 → 2752.32] endurance,
[2752.64 → 2753.20] and faith,
[2753.40 → 2756.16] who can live rejoicing in the world to come,
[2756.30 → 2758.12] and with joy in the world that is,
[2758.50 → 2761.42] holding on to the love that holds on to us,
[2761.56 → 2762.58] living it boldly,
[2763.10 → 2764.64] longing for the day
[2764.64 → 2767.82] when all will be made whole.
[2769.18 → 2771.00] This last Sunday of Advent,
[2771.76 → 2773.18] we look at that last line.
[2773.28 → 2776.40] We're going to live in this longing for the day
[2776.40 → 2778.96] when all will be made whole.
[2778.96 → 2782.68] This last Sunday of Advent,
[2782.90 → 2785.72] we have called the Sunday of peace.
[2785.88 → 2787.72] We heard it in the candle lighting ceremony
[2787.72 → 2788.72] at the beginning,
[2788.92 → 2791.54] and in this we are looking at the theme of
[2791.54 → 2793.74] and longing for peace.
[2794.06 → 2795.86] And we're going to do this in our time
[2795.86 → 2800.30] by zeroing in and framing around
[2800.30 → 2802.34] verse 3 of what we read.
[2802.42 → 2804.28] And so if you've got that there,
[2804.28 → 2805.40] verse 3,
[2805.40 → 2808.88] no longer will there be any curse.
[2809.28 → 2810.86] The throne of God and of the Lamb
[2810.86 → 2811.82] will be in the city,
[2812.02 → 2814.92] and His servants will serve Him.
[2816.94 → 2821.12] This will be our definition of peace.
[2821.74 → 2823.34] No longer will there be any curse,
[2823.72 → 2825.30] and the throne of God and of the Lamb
[2825.30 → 2826.22] will be in the city,
[2826.32 → 2829.00] and His servants will serve Him.
[2829.00 → 2831.98] We're coming at this idea of peace
[2831.98 → 2834.42] in what you might recognize
[2834.42 → 2836.66] is an almost Jewish sense.
[2838.16 → 2840.24] Peace here, and for us,
[2840.34 → 2842.04] is about shalom.
[2842.62 → 2844.34] That's the Hebrew word, shalom.
[2844.86 → 2847.96] And shalom is really about wholeness.
[2848.44 → 2849.58] It is about purpose.
[2849.68 → 2852.18] It is about purpose-filled and fulfilled,
[2852.40 → 2855.20] and living out of that purpose.
[2855.20 → 2859.34] I love the way that theologian
[2859.34 → 2861.48] and president of Calvin Seminary
[2861.48 → 2862.10] while I was there,
[2862.24 → 2864.42] Cornelius Planting summarizes it.
[2865.32 → 2865.74] He writes,
[2866.00 → 2870.12] In the Bible, shalom means
[2870.12 → 2872.08] universal flourishing,
[2872.76 → 2874.42] wholeness, and delight.
[2875.44 → 2876.76] A rich state of affairs
[2876.76 → 2878.88] in which natural needs are satisfied
[2878.88 → 2881.66] and natural gifts fruitfully employed.
[2882.18 → 2883.84] A state of affairs that inspires
[2883.84 → 2885.10] joyful wonder
[2885.10 → 2887.44] as its creator and saviour
[2887.44 → 2888.48] opens doors
[2888.48 → 2890.32] and welcomes the creatures
[2890.32 → 2892.16] in whom He delights.
[2892.54 → 2894.24] Shalom, in other words,
[2894.40 → 2895.00] he says,
[2895.20 → 2898.38] is the way things ought to be.
[2900.06 → 2904.34] Shalom is what you were created for.
[2905.82 → 2907.26] It's what this whole world
[2907.26 → 2909.08] was created for,
[2909.18 → 2911.34] and our rebellion against God.
[2911.46 → 2913.02] Human sin from the first,
[2913.02 → 2914.44] from Adam and Eve
[2914.44 → 2915.96] all the way to the present,
[2915.96 → 2916.80] to today,
[2916.96 → 2919.56] is a breaking of shalom.
[2921.18 → 2921.74] And now,
[2921.90 → 2924.12] we live in this constant state
[2924.12 → 2928.12] of searching for that wholeness again,
[2928.28 → 2931.38] or of settling for something
[2931.38 → 2934.10] other than true shalom,
[2934.50 → 2937.06] because we don't know how to find it,
[2937.86 → 2938.68] but we're looking.
[2938.68 → 2942.20] Now, I've said it before here,
[2943.02 → 2946.04] but perhaps the two greatest desires,
[2946.34 → 2947.42] and because I've said it before,
[2947.50 → 2948.44] when I say desires,
[2948.54 → 2949.18] in your head,
[2949.26 → 2950.46] you might hear the word idols,
[2950.60 → 2951.26] and that would be fair.
[2952.18 → 2953.34] But what I mean here
[2953.34 → 2954.56] are your pursuits,
[2955.00 → 2957.26] the focuses of your attention,
[2957.84 → 2959.70] the focus of your heart,
[2959.84 → 2960.60] your affection,
[2960.88 → 2962.44] the focus of your effort,
[2963.02 → 2963.16] right?
[2963.16 → 2965.14] The two greatest desires
[2965.14 → 2966.54] in the world today
[2966.54 → 2968.52] can be boiled down to
[2968.52 → 2969.78] ideas of comfort
[2969.78 → 2972.10] and ideas of security.
[2973.92 → 2974.04] Right?
[2974.28 → 2976.16] Easy and ease.
[2977.26 → 2978.22] And if you are living,
[2978.42 → 2979.08] in any way,
[2979.18 → 2980.80] out of the 21st century
[2980.80 → 2983.64] Western consumerist frame,
[2984.04 → 2986.00] and I'm going to be honest with you,
[2986.08 → 2987.08] all of us are,
[2987.18 → 2988.92] because that's the water we swim in,
[2988.92 → 2990.82] or the snow we shovel,
[2991.00 → 2991.56] maybe today,
[2992.14 → 2992.34] right?
[2992.40 → 2993.46] That's the world
[2993.46 → 2994.64] we are a part of.
[2994.90 → 2996.54] If you live in this era
[2996.54 → 2998.04] and time and place,
[2998.40 → 3001.28] you are being habitually formed
[3001.28 → 3002.68] and shaped and pulled
[3002.68 → 3003.52] and pushed,
[3004.04 → 3005.44] and part of you
[3005.44 → 3008.94] is pursuing these twin pillars
[3008.94 → 3010.98] of comfort and security
[3010.98 → 3014.06] that so many have come to believe
[3014.06 → 3015.84] is the purpose of life.
[3015.84 → 3016.36] Right?
[3017.60 → 3019.38] And there is a cheap version
[3019.38 → 3020.46] of shalom
[3020.46 → 3022.20] that we are being offered
[3022.20 → 3023.34] and we are told
[3023.34 → 3024.50] that it will come
[3024.50 → 3025.86] at the end of the road
[3025.86 → 3026.96] of enough comfort
[3026.96 → 3028.28] and enough security.
[3030.96 → 3031.48] Now,
[3033.52 → 3034.86] I'm going to do a bit of
[3034.86 → 3036.78] cultural exegesis
[3036.78 → 3038.46] with you for a moment.
[3039.70 → 3040.54] And to do that,
[3040.62 → 3041.88] we have to do a bit of philosophy,
[3042.22 → 3044.48] so come along this journey with me.
[3044.48 → 3045.74] But let me explain
[3045.74 → 3047.28] what I see here.
[3047.44 → 3048.68] And to do that well,
[3048.76 → 3049.78] we actually need to go back
[3049.78 → 3052.56] 150 years or so.
[3053.32 → 3054.62] In the 19th century,
[3054.72 → 3056.16] at the end of the 19th century,
[3056.50 → 3057.48] there is an atheist philosopher
[3058.04 → 3060.28] by the name of Friedrich Nietzsche.
[3061.24 → 3061.44] Now,
[3061.46 → 3062.92] Nietzsche is most famous
[3062.92 → 3064.54] for having declared,
[3064.92 → 3066.30] God is dead.
[3067.28 → 3067.48] Right?
[3067.54 → 3068.48] You've probably heard
[3068.48 → 3070.02] this quote before.
[3070.42 → 3070.66] Now,
[3070.70 → 3071.64] when he said that,
[3071.64 → 3073.40] he wasn't being flippant
[3073.40 → 3074.50] or dismissive.
[3074.60 → 3074.68] Right?
[3074.72 → 3076.28] His argument was that
[3076.28 → 3078.12] reason and science
[3078.12 → 3079.72] have moved humanity
[3079.72 → 3081.60] beyond a need
[3081.60 → 3083.58] for the idea of God.
[3084.46 → 3084.66] Right?
[3084.72 → 3086.36] Especially for understanding
[3086.36 → 3087.86] how the world
[3087.86 → 3089.42] has come to be
[3089.42 → 3090.34] and how it works
[3090.34 → 3092.50] and what is humanity's place
[3092.50 → 3093.28] within it.
[3093.32 → 3093.44] Right?
[3093.46 → 3094.54] We don't need God.
[3094.64 → 3095.42] God is dead.
[3095.52 → 3096.82] We've moved beyond that.
[3098.14 → 3098.36] Now,
[3098.36 → 3098.98] for Nietzsche,
[3099.66 → 3101.34] God was never real.
[3101.84 → 3101.88] Right?
[3101.92 → 3103.36] God was an idea
[3103.36 → 3106.38] that acted for people
[3106.38 → 3109.14] as a crutch
[3109.14 → 3110.12] in the face
[3110.12 → 3111.14] of our unknowing.
[3112.00 → 3112.22] Right?
[3112.26 → 3113.06] And that God
[3113.06 → 3113.86] was an idea
[3113.86 → 3114.84] that acted for people
[3114.84 → 3116.02] as a cudgel
[3116.02 → 3117.52] for our grasping
[3117.52 → 3118.54] of power.
[3119.54 → 3119.72] So,
[3119.78 → 3120.52] according to Nietzsche,
[3120.68 → 3121.58] God was a crutch
[3121.58 → 3122.58] and a cudgel
[3122.58 → 3124.12] and we've moved
[3124.12 → 3124.92] beyond him
[3124.92 → 3126.42] or a need
[3126.42 → 3128.48] for God.
[3128.60 → 3129.34] He wouldn't use
[3129.34 → 3130.08] a personal pronoun.
[3131.10 → 3132.04] But still,
[3133.62 → 3134.88] Nietzsche recognized
[3134.88 → 3136.78] that the effect
[3136.78 → 3139.10] of the death of God
[3139.10 → 3140.72] would have on society.
[3141.56 → 3141.64] Right?
[3141.70 → 3142.50] Nietzsche writes
[3142.50 → 3143.56] that belief
[3143.56 → 3144.64] in the Christian God
[3144.64 → 3146.18] has become unbelievable
[3146.18 → 3147.76] and then he goes on
[3147.76 → 3148.68] to say that the cost
[3148.68 → 3149.80] of the death of God
[3149.80 → 3150.52] would be,
[3150.82 → 3151.22] quote,
[3151.22 → 3154.22] our entire European morality.
[3154.92 → 3156.34] And then,
[3156.46 → 3157.50] you read his argument further,
[3157.62 → 3158.16] he goes on
[3158.16 → 3159.44] to admit the difficulty,
[3159.88 → 3160.98] even the possibility
[3160.98 → 3162.18] for himself,
[3162.46 → 3163.50] with even all the insights
[3163.50 → 3164.00] that he has,
[3164.34 → 3165.20] of supposing
[3165.20 → 3166.06] what this event
[3166.06 → 3167.52] really means.
[3170.48 → 3170.74] Now,
[3171.92 → 3174.00] taking this,
[3174.12 → 3175.92] it is my contention
[3175.92 → 3177.02] and lots of others
[3177.02 → 3178.10] would agree with this,
[3178.18 → 3180.86] that the death of God
[3180.86 → 3182.56] in the Western
[3182.56 → 3183.90] intellectual tradition
[3183.90 → 3185.78] that we find ourselves in
[3185.78 → 3187.66] creates a crisis
[3187.66 → 3188.68] of meaning
[3188.68 → 3190.26] in the lives
[3190.26 → 3191.54] of ordinary people.
[3192.58 → 3193.86] The death of God
[3193.86 → 3194.90] creates a crisis
[3194.90 → 3195.56] of meaning
[3195.56 → 3196.58] in the lives
[3196.58 → 3197.54] of ordinary people.
[3197.62 → 3198.16] So this isn't
[3198.16 → 3199.16] some obscure philosopher
[3199.16 → 3200.36] from 150 years ago,
[3200.48 → 3201.68] this matters for you
[3201.68 → 3202.30] today.
[3203.30 → 3204.50] Fast forward to today,
[3204.64 → 3205.30] this idea
[3205.30 → 3206.10] is coming home
[3206.10 → 3206.66] to roost.
[3208.02 → 3209.58] One of the best podcasts
[3209.58 → 3210.58] I've listened to
[3210.58 → 3211.38] recently
[3211.38 → 3212.58] is you have
[3212.58 → 3213.78] a cognitive scientist,
[3213.96 → 3214.64] a psychologist,
[3214.94 → 3215.96] a Catholic bishop,
[3216.08 → 3216.82] and a philosopher
[3216.82 → 3217.98] talking about
[3217.98 → 3219.24] the meaning crisis.
[3220.40 → 3221.46] In a world
[3221.46 → 3222.26] that has pulled
[3222.26 → 3223.46] or is pulling out
[3223.46 → 3224.66] the Christian foundations
[3224.66 → 3225.96] of Western civilization,
[3226.42 → 3227.50] the cost of that
[3227.50 → 3228.22] has been
[3228.22 → 3229.92] our sense of meaning
[3229.92 → 3231.08] in the world,
[3232.14 → 3232.28] right,
[3232.30 → 3233.42] or a shared sense
[3233.42 → 3233.96] of meaning.
[3235.12 → 3235.92] So the question's like,
[3236.02 → 3236.64] what matters?
[3237.16 → 3238.38] Or why does anything
[3238.38 → 3239.04] matter?
[3239.04 → 3240.80] Is there a universal
[3240.80 → 3242.06] and shared ground
[3242.06 → 3243.46] for discerning meaning
[3243.46 → 3244.76] or is it all subjective
[3244.76 → 3246.28] and self-determined?
[3246.62 → 3247.80] How do I know?
[3248.12 → 3249.00] What do I trust?
[3249.10 → 3250.10] Or who do I trust?
[3251.00 → 3252.04] That's the crisis
[3252.04 → 3252.86] that people are
[3252.86 → 3254.18] living out of
[3254.18 → 3254.74] right now.
[3254.84 → 3255.28] They can't,
[3255.42 → 3256.62] we can't even answer
[3256.62 → 3258.14] these questions well.
[3259.28 → 3259.98] And I think that
[3259.98 → 3260.94] the contemporary
[3260.94 → 3262.72] meaning crisis,
[3264.24 → 3266.66] let me say this,
[3266.74 → 3268.12] this meaning crisis,
[3268.12 → 3269.60] for some of you,
[3269.72 → 3270.86] particularly if you're older,
[3271.34 → 3272.44] what I'm saying to you
[3272.44 → 3273.14] right now doesn't
[3273.14 → 3273.90] make any sense.
[3274.86 → 3276.14] But if you're in your 20s,
[3276.88 → 3278.16] this is your life.
[3278.98 → 3280.08] If you're a teenager
[3280.08 → 3280.54] right now
[3280.54 → 3281.28] and the trajectory
[3281.28 → 3281.88] that we're on
[3281.88 → 3282.44] holds true,
[3282.74 → 3283.58] this will be
[3283.58 → 3285.32] incredibly important
[3285.32 → 3286.14] for you to be thinking
[3286.14 → 3287.30] about and discerning.
[3288.68 → 3288.78] Right?
[3288.84 → 3289.68] And here's the thing,
[3289.94 → 3290.08] right,
[3290.14 → 3291.56] you may not be able
[3291.56 → 3293.04] to exactly articulate
[3293.04 → 3294.66] what I'm talking about here
[3294.66 → 3295.70] as a meaning crisis,
[3295.70 → 3297.40] but you feel it
[3297.40 → 3299.06] in your soul.
[3301.02 → 3302.10] And I think that there is a
[3302.60 → 3303.82] in this contemporary
[3303.82 → 3304.68] meaning crisis,
[3304.68 → 3306.32] there is a straight line
[3306.32 → 3308.62] between the feeling
[3308.62 → 3309.66] of this crisis
[3309.66 → 3311.66] and the loss
[3311.66 → 3312.72] of shalom.
[3313.40 → 3316.22] The loss of a shared idea
[3316.22 → 3317.54] of what shalom
[3317.54 → 3319.26] really is.
[3320.28 → 3321.60] And because we've lost
[3321.60 → 3322.98] this shared sense
[3322.98 → 3324.36] and idea of shalom,
[3324.68 → 3326.40] we've lost our connection
[3326.40 → 3327.60] to purpose.
[3328.36 → 3329.74] We've lost our sense
[3329.74 → 3330.64] of the direction
[3330.64 → 3332.34] that this is all headed in.
[3333.48 → 3333.60] Right?
[3333.66 → 3334.56] And with the supposed
[3334.56 → 3335.66] death of God,
[3335.76 → 3337.08] we've lost our teacher.
[3338.24 → 3338.36] Right?
[3338.36 → 3339.06] The one that we were
[3339.06 → 3340.02] supposed to trust
[3340.02 → 3341.06] to get us through
[3341.06 → 3342.10] and to train us
[3342.10 → 3342.70] to the end.
[3342.86 → 3343.82] And without trust
[3343.82 → 3344.78] and without the teacher,
[3345.10 → 3345.84] without our sense
[3345.84 → 3346.86] of where we are headed,
[3347.14 → 3348.16] so many of us
[3348.16 → 3349.74] are just left floundering
[3349.74 → 3351.06] and feeling lost
[3351.06 → 3352.08] and trying to figure it out
[3352.08 → 3352.66] on our own.
[3352.92 → 3354.12] And in trying to figure it out
[3354.12 → 3354.68] on our own,
[3354.86 → 3355.80] we have created
[3355.80 → 3357.18] and settled for
[3357.18 → 3358.28] these cheap
[3358.28 → 3360.42] and other substitutes.
[3362.86 → 3363.90] Now, there are countless
[3363.90 → 3365.42] of these in the world today.
[3365.46 → 3366.34] And I'm going to zero in
[3366.34 → 3367.52] on just one
[3367.52 → 3368.10] that relates
[3368.10 → 3369.56] to our time this morning.
[3370.36 → 3371.42] But we can talk further
[3371.42 → 3372.28] and see how this
[3372.28 → 3373.68] works itself out.
[3373.88 → 3375.20] One of the substitutes
[3375.20 → 3376.78] that we have created
[3376.78 → 3377.66] in the world today
[3377.66 → 3378.98] that tries to fill
[3378.98 → 3380.28] this meaning gap
[3380.28 → 3382.08] has been called
[3382.08 → 3384.70] by some comfort culture.
[3386.24 → 3386.68] Let me give you
[3386.68 → 3387.46] an illustration of this.
[3387.54 → 3388.24] Every year,
[3388.54 → 3389.54] around this time,
[3389.90 → 3391.46] the Oxford Dictionary
[3391.46 → 3392.16] and all the other
[3392.16 → 3393.70] online dictionaries,
[3393.80 → 3394.62] they begin to sort of
[3394.62 → 3395.62] publish their
[3395.62 → 3396.86] word of the year.
[3397.54 → 3397.64] Right?
[3397.76 → 3399.22] News reports,
[3399.34 → 3400.68] CBC does this every year.
[3400.76 → 3401.30] They kind of take
[3401.30 → 3402.20] the collection of them
[3402.20 → 3402.90] and tell you
[3402.90 → 3403.76] what the word
[3403.76 → 3405.26] of the year is.
[3405.74 → 3406.00] Right?
[3406.06 → 3406.60] And it's a word
[3406.60 → 3407.28] that is intended
[3407.28 → 3408.10] to sort of like
[3408.10 → 3409.88] define or explain
[3409.88 → 3410.86] the experience
[3410.86 → 3411.78] of the year before.
[3412.00 → 3413.14] Sometimes it's a new word
[3413.14 → 3413.92] that was created
[3413.92 → 3415.28] during that year
[3415.28 → 3415.84] and it's added
[3415.84 → 3416.52] to the dictionary.
[3417.36 → 3417.54] Anyway,
[3417.56 → 3418.40] there are all sorts of
[3418.40 → 3419.46] words that come
[3419.46 → 3420.38] and there are runners up
[3420.38 → 3420.86] and the like.
[3421.16 → 3422.44] One of the words
[3422.44 → 3423.48] for this year
[3423.48 → 3425.20] is goblin mode.
[3426.72 → 3427.14] Some of you
[3427.14 → 3427.64] are looking at me
[3427.64 → 3428.26] like I'm crazy.
[3428.38 → 3429.56] Have anyone else
[3429.56 → 3430.22] heard of the word
[3430.22 → 3431.02] goblin mode?
[3431.68 → 3432.08] Yeah, see,
[3432.18 → 3432.82] there's some people
[3432.82 → 3433.42] in their 20s
[3433.42 → 3433.76] who are like,
[3433.84 → 3434.00] yeah,
[3434.18 → 3434.94] I know exactly
[3434.94 → 3435.62] what that is.
[3436.52 → 3437.58] Goblin mode
[3437.58 → 3440.72] refers to,
[3441.62 → 3442.54] how can I
[3442.54 → 3443.94] articulate it?
[3444.94 → 3445.78] Your house
[3445.78 → 3446.50] is a mess
[3446.50 → 3448.00] because you've
[3448.00 → 3449.28] ordered Uber Eats
[3449.28 → 3450.64] for the last six days
[3450.64 → 3452.24] and you haven't
[3452.24 → 3452.90] done laundry
[3452.90 → 3454.18] because you are
[3454.18 → 3455.14] committed to
[3455.14 → 3457.18] 100% completing
[3457.18 → 3458.14] the new god of war.
[3459.30 → 3460.04] And so you're
[3460.04 → 3461.00] living in track pants
[3461.00 → 3462.70] and in sloth
[3462.70 → 3463.86] because that's
[3463.86 → 3464.28] what you're going
[3464.28 → 3464.62] to do.
[3464.62 → 3465.46] And it doesn't
[3465.46 → 3465.68] matter.
[3465.78 → 3466.48] You look like
[3466.48 → 3467.08] a goblin.
[3468.50 → 3468.60] Right?
[3468.64 → 3470.46] That's goblin mode.
[3471.02 → 3471.08] Right?
[3471.28 → 3472.28] Comfort culture
[3472.28 → 3473.80] or goblin mode
[3473.80 → 3474.62] is like the extreme
[3474.62 → 3475.50] form of comfort
[3475.50 → 3475.90] culture.
[3476.48 → 3477.14] Comfort culture
[3477.14 → 3478.56] is Netflix
[3478.56 → 3479.32] binging
[3479.32 → 3480.94] and not knowing
[3480.94 → 3481.30] what happened
[3481.30 → 3481.90] to the last six
[3481.90 → 3482.60] hours of your day.
[3483.56 → 3483.66] Right?
[3483.74 → 3484.32] Comfort culture
[3484.32 → 3485.40] is Instagram
[3485.40 → 3486.20] scrolling
[3486.20 → 3488.98] because you don't
[3488.98 → 3489.54] really want to deal
[3489.54 → 3489.94] with the people
[3489.94 → 3490.50] beside you.
[3491.58 → 3492.28] Comfort culture
[3492.28 → 3493.48] is fantasy
[3493.48 → 3495.10] sports scheming
[3495.10 → 3495.90] and planning
[3495.90 → 3496.82] and trading
[3496.82 → 3498.08] and shifting.
[3499.64 → 3500.62] One writer
[3500.62 → 3502.08] that I read
[3502.08 → 3502.62] this week
[3502.62 → 3503.62] called them
[3503.62 → 3505.38] comfy couch
[3505.38 → 3506.38] consolations
[3506.38 → 3507.22] to fill
[3507.22 → 3508.04] the meaning
[3508.04 → 3508.44] gap.
[3509.44 → 3510.10] They said
[3510.10 → 3510.90] it is a form
[3510.90 → 3511.64] of consumption
[3511.64 → 3513.12] to ameliorate
[3513.12 → 3513.86] ennui.
[3515.14 → 3516.08] Comfy couch
[3516.08 → 3516.64] consumption
[3516.64 → 3518.14] to fill
[3518.14 → 3519.50] the meaning
[3519.50 → 3519.84] gap
[3519.84 → 3520.76] and consumption
[3520.76 → 3522.16] to ameliorate
[3522.16 → 3522.92] ennui.
[3524.10 → 3525.02] I repeat that
[3525.02 → 3525.60] because I just think
[3525.60 → 3526.46] some people can write.
[3527.26 → 3527.78] Some people know
[3527.78 → 3528.34] how to write
[3528.34 → 3529.04] and it's compelling
[3529.04 → 3530.36] but the point is
[3530.36 → 3531.80] that we consume
[3531.80 → 3533.08] distractions
[3533.08 → 3534.76] to numb us
[3534.76 → 3535.72] or to perhaps
[3535.72 → 3536.64] hold at bay
[3536.64 → 3537.46] for five minutes
[3537.46 → 3538.30] longer the truth
[3538.30 → 3539.36] that I really just
[3539.36 → 3540.08] feel this sense
[3540.08 → 3540.84] of meaninglessness.
[3542.18 → 3542.40] And now
[3542.40 → 3543.20] don't hear what
[3543.20 → 3543.88] I'm not saying
[3543.88 → 3544.16] right?
[3544.22 → 3545.06] Because I love
[3545.06 → 3545.76] a good movie.
[3546.76 → 3547.74] And I'm the first
[3547.74 → 3548.72] to enjoy
[3548.72 → 3549.62] a good game
[3549.62 → 3550.30] a video game
[3550.30 → 3550.84] or otherwise.
[3551.40 → 3552.34] I love food
[3552.34 → 3552.82] and I love
[3552.82 → 3553.62] foodie culture
[3553.62 → 3554.64] and I believe
[3554.64 → 3555.88] that most of these
[3555.88 → 3556.12] things,
[3556.20 → 3557.12] maybe even all of them
[3557.12 → 3557.80] if done properly
[3557.80 → 3558.68] are good gifts
[3558.68 → 3559.14] of God
[3559.14 → 3559.94] for his people.
[3560.36 → 3560.92] And I believe
[3560.92 → 3561.56] that we can even
[3561.56 → 3562.48] look at some
[3562.48 → 3563.00] of these things
[3563.00 → 3563.70] as part of
[3563.70 → 3564.44] God's gift
[3564.44 → 3565.54] of common grace
[3565.54 → 3566.44] to the world
[3566.44 → 3567.04] as we learn
[3567.04 → 3567.98] how to rest
[3567.98 → 3568.86] in him
[3568.86 → 3569.60] and as our rest
[3569.60 → 3570.38] is an expression
[3570.38 → 3571.24] of our trust
[3571.24 → 3571.94] in him
[3571.94 → 3572.64] and our gratitude
[3572.64 → 3573.74] for all that
[3573.74 → 3574.50] he has done.
[3575.76 → 3576.80] But,
[3577.60 → 3579.68] and I'll say it again,
[3580.44 → 3581.32] because we have
[3581.32 → 3582.58] lost the big picture,
[3583.22 → 3584.74] because we no longer
[3584.74 → 3585.70] have comprehensive
[3585.70 → 3586.72] understanding of
[3586.72 → 3587.22] shalom
[3587.22 → 3588.32] that God has
[3588.32 → 3589.36] created us for
[3589.36 → 3590.06] and to live
[3590.06 → 3590.94] with him in,
[3591.34 → 3592.48] we substitute
[3592.48 → 3594.24] these lesser glories,
[3594.46 → 3595.08] these lesser
[3595.08 → 3596.32] experiences of shalom,
[3596.44 → 3597.54] these other good things
[3597.54 → 3599.06] into ultimate things.
[3599.40 → 3601.28] We take them
[3601.28 → 3601.80] in place
[3601.80 → 3602.54] of the fullest
[3602.54 → 3603.22] one.
[3603.22 → 3603.88] Right?
[3603.92 → 3604.72] We want Netflix
[3604.72 → 3606.22] to numb the reality
[3606.22 → 3607.58] of our unknowing.
[3607.90 → 3608.58] We want scrolling
[3608.58 → 3609.46] Instagram Reels
[3609.46 → 3610.30] to hold at bay
[3610.30 → 3611.50] the dissatisfaction
[3611.50 → 3612.46] we have with
[3612.46 → 3613.14] our own lives.
[3614.72 → 3616.38] And here's the thing,
[3616.44 → 3616.88] and here's where
[3616.88 → 3617.88] we begin to tie
[3617.88 → 3618.54] this all together.
[3618.96 → 3619.92] Because as Christians,
[3620.16 → 3620.70] sitting here
[3620.70 → 3622.16] on Sunday especially,
[3622.40 → 3622.52] right,
[3622.64 → 3623.68] we know that
[3623.68 → 3624.80] Nietzsche was wrong
[3624.80 → 3626.06] when he declared
[3626.06 → 3626.92] God is dead.
[3626.92 → 3626.96] dead.
[3627.84 → 3628.88] And yet,
[3629.76 → 3632.28] I would dare say
[3632.28 → 3633.04] that every one
[3633.04 → 3633.66] of us
[3633.66 → 3635.54] lives
[3635.54 → 3636.94] as if these
[3636.94 → 3637.86] idols of comfort
[3637.86 → 3638.72] and security
[3638.72 → 3640.30] are true
[3640.30 → 3640.94] and our full
[3640.94 → 3641.56] sense of meaning.
[3641.90 → 3642.82] And when we live
[3642.82 → 3643.38] with these
[3643.38 → 3644.44] as our source
[3644.44 → 3644.92] of meaning
[3644.92 → 3645.50] and purpose
[3645.50 → 3646.04] in the world
[3646.04 → 3647.02] in order to increase
[3647.02 → 3647.62] our comfort
[3647.62 → 3648.36] and security,
[3648.60 → 3649.94] we end up proving
[3649.94 → 3651.34] Nietzsche functionally
[3651.34 → 3652.26] right.
[3654.76 → 3655.72] I'll put it this way,
[3655.72 → 3656.46] a few years ago,
[3657.08 → 3658.00] Craig Groschen
[3658.00 → 3658.64] wrote a book
[3658.64 → 3660.36] that gets at this idea.
[3660.48 → 3661.10] The book that he wrote
[3661.10 → 3661.50] is called
[3661.50 → 3662.82] The Christian Atheist.
[3663.68 → 3664.98] The tagline of that book
[3664.98 → 3665.68] tells you what you need
[3665.68 → 3665.92] to know.
[3665.98 → 3666.16] It says,
[3666.52 → 3667.54] Believing in God
[3667.54 → 3668.68] but living as if
[3668.68 → 3669.76] he doesn't exist.
[3672.80 → 3673.78] Who does that define?
[3676.06 → 3676.84] You don't actually
[3676.84 → 3677.72] have to put your hands up,
[3678.92 → 3680.06] but I suggest
[3680.06 → 3681.72] every one of us.
[3683.06 → 3683.94] Believing in God
[3683.94 → 3684.66] but living as he
[3684.66 → 3685.64] doesn't exist.
[3685.72 → 3686.16] He goes on
[3686.16 → 3686.90] to ask,
[3687.00 → 3688.00] who do we believe more,
[3688.10 → 3689.68] ourselves or God?
[3690.50 → 3691.46] Our actions
[3691.46 → 3692.36] and decisions
[3692.36 → 3693.82] will reflect
[3693.82 → 3695.62] that answer.
[3697.84 → 3699.14] That's an introspection
[3699.14 → 3700.00] question
[3700.00 → 3701.50] that kind of scares me
[3701.50 → 3702.28] a little bit
[3702.28 → 3702.78] and it's one
[3702.78 → 3703.70] that I force myself
[3703.70 → 3704.52] to ask over
[3704.52 → 3705.68] and over again
[3705.68 → 3706.82] and I sometimes
[3706.82 → 3707.98] wonder if
[3707.98 → 3709.46] as a church
[3709.46 → 3710.84] we profess
[3710.84 → 3712.32] belief in God
[3712.32 → 3714.26] but we live
[3714.26 → 3715.10] as atheists.
[3715.72 → 3718.58] David Platt
[3718.58 → 3720.00] in his awesome
[3720.00 → 3720.78] little book
[3720.78 → 3721.38] Radical
[3721.38 → 3722.84] he writes
[3722.84 → 3723.42] the following.
[3723.54 → 3723.82] He says,
[3724.46 → 3725.72] somewhere along the way
[3725.72 → 3726.46] we have missed
[3726.46 → 3727.20] what is radical
[3727.20 → 3728.20] about our faith
[3728.20 → 3729.24] and replaced it
[3729.24 → 3730.38] with what is comfortable.
[3731.26 → 3732.06] We settle
[3732.06 → 3732.90] for a Christianity
[3732.90 → 3734.10] that revolves around
[3734.10 → 3735.46] catering to ourselves
[3735.46 → 3737.08] when the central message
[3737.08 → 3737.72] of Christianity
[3737.72 → 3739.20] is actually about
[3739.20 → 3740.22] abandoning
[3740.22 → 3741.12] ourselves.
[3741.12 → 3745.50] and so what is it
[3745.50 → 3747.14] that will fill up
[3747.14 → 3748.48] the meaning crisis?
[3749.52 → 3750.26] What is it
[3750.26 → 3751.18] that will overcome
[3751.18 → 3752.48] your apathy?
[3753.36 → 3754.04] What is it
[3754.04 → 3755.02] that will allow us
[3755.02 → 3755.66] to live
[3755.66 → 3756.84] as Christians
[3756.84 → 3758.46] not as Christian
[3758.46 → 3759.62] atheists?
[3759.98 → 3761.10] As though God
[3761.10 → 3762.28] is truly God
[3762.28 → 3762.96] and powerful
[3762.96 → 3763.80] and sovereign
[3763.80 → 3764.92] over all the earth
[3764.92 → 3765.78] and what will that
[3765.78 → 3766.58] change
[3766.58 → 3767.56] if you do?
[3767.56 → 3769.60] What do we need
[3769.60 → 3770.94] to cast off
[3770.94 → 3772.00] or how do we
[3772.00 → 3772.66] cast off
[3772.66 → 3773.48] the comfortable
[3773.48 → 3774.94] and then embrace
[3774.94 → 3775.88] the cost
[3775.88 → 3776.98] of radical
[3776.98 → 3778.16] discipleship?
[3780.16 → 3780.98] And while there's
[3780.98 → 3781.90] no easy answer
[3781.90 → 3783.14] to that question
[3783.14 → 3784.04] and every one of you
[3784.04 → 3785.20] will have to discern
[3785.20 → 3786.22] what that means
[3786.22 → 3786.64] for you
[3786.64 → 3787.38] and how you will
[3787.38 → 3787.92] do that
[3787.92 → 3789.52] I know
[3789.52 → 3790.78] that doing this
[3790.78 → 3791.82] and asking these questions
[3791.82 → 3792.52] answering them
[3792.52 → 3793.38] will actually
[3793.38 → 3794.90] have the impact
[3794.90 → 3795.98] of making life
[3795.98 → 3797.22] more difficult
[3797.22 → 3798.50] for most of us.
[3800.04 → 3800.98] And Jesus knew
[3800.98 → 3801.96] that that would be true too
[3801.96 → 3803.24] because he warned us
[3803.24 → 3804.34] in John 16
[3804.34 → 3804.96] he says
[3804.96 → 3805.88] in this world
[3805.88 → 3806.96] you will have trouble.
[3809.86 → 3810.80] But he adds
[3810.80 → 3811.64] take heart
[3811.64 → 3814.74] I have overcome
[3814.74 → 3816.20] the world.
[3818.48 → 3819.30] And so I believe
[3819.30 → 3821.56] that the beginning
[3821.56 → 3822.62] of an answer
[3822.62 → 3824.08] to the meaning crisis
[3824.08 → 3824.90] that we find
[3824.90 → 3825.84] ourselves in
[3825.84 → 3826.82] starts
[3826.82 → 3828.06] with a shared
[3828.06 → 3828.64] vision
[3828.64 → 3829.78] of what is ahead.
[3830.56 → 3831.66] Starts with a shared
[3831.66 → 3832.36] vision of
[3832.36 → 3833.54] of shalom
[3833.54 → 3834.06] that is
[3834.06 → 3835.00] compelling
[3835.00 → 3836.40] to our hearts
[3836.40 → 3837.26] and to our
[3837.26 → 3838.04] imaginations.
[3839.62 → 3840.14] And so John
[3840.14 → 3840.56] writes
[3840.56 → 3840.98] he says
[3840.98 → 3841.86] then the angel
[3841.86 → 3842.74] showed me
[3842.74 → 3843.62] the river
[3843.62 → 3844.42] of the water
[3844.42 → 3845.08] of life
[3845.08 → 3846.10] as clear
[3846.10 → 3847.24] as crystal
[3847.24 → 3847.86] flowing
[3847.86 → 3848.82] from the throne
[3848.82 → 3849.44] of God
[3849.44 → 3850.70] and of the Lamb.
[3851.62 → 3851.70] Right?
[3851.76 → 3852.10] But John
[3852.10 → 3852.80] is giving us
[3852.80 → 3853.60] this beautiful
[3853.60 → 3854.14] picture
[3854.14 → 3855.48] of a renewed
[3855.48 → 3856.40] earth
[3856.40 → 3857.68] and it's a picture
[3857.68 → 3858.60] that parallels
[3858.60 → 3859.66] quite closely
[3859.66 → 3860.58] the garden
[3860.58 → 3861.22] of Eden
[3861.22 → 3861.84] that we see
[3861.84 → 3862.66] in Genesis 1
[3862.66 → 3863.14] and 2
[3863.14 → 3863.84] but here
[3863.84 → 3864.48] now
[3864.48 → 3865.36] it's not just
[3865.36 → 3865.90] a garden
[3865.90 → 3867.22] but it's a city
[3867.22 → 3868.40] that looks like
[3868.40 → 3868.86] a garden.
[3869.28 → 3869.64] And so there's
[3869.64 → 3870.52] been this progression
[3870.52 → 3871.36] this movement
[3871.36 → 3872.24] from the intent
[3872.24 → 3873.00] in the beginning
[3873.00 → 3874.94] now that culminates
[3874.94 → 3875.90] and comes together
[3875.90 → 3877.08] in this beautiful
[3877.08 → 3877.94] picture.
[3877.94 → 3878.20] Right?
[3878.48 → 3879.42] And so we see
[3879.42 → 3880.12] the world
[3880.12 → 3881.00] the way it was
[3881.00 → 3882.52] before the rebellion
[3882.52 → 3883.56] against God
[3883.56 → 3884.54] before the fall
[3884.54 → 3885.42] the shalom
[3885.42 → 3886.44] that Adam and Eve
[3886.44 → 3888.12] lived with God
[3888.12 → 3889.08] in the midst of
[3889.08 → 3889.86] we see that
[3889.86 → 3890.80] restored
[3890.80 → 3892.00] and this world
[3892.00 → 3892.92] transformed
[3892.92 → 3893.66] right?
[3893.76 → 3894.48] This river
[3894.48 → 3895.02] we read
[3895.02 → 3896.12] is made up
[3896.12 → 3897.72] of living water.
[3898.34 → 3899.02] That phrase
[3899.02 → 3899.80] living water
[3899.80 → 3900.56] is the same
[3900.56 → 3901.40] word pair
[3901.40 → 3902.88] that Jesus uses
[3902.88 → 3903.62] when talking
[3903.62 → 3904.46] to the woman
[3904.46 → 3905.08] at the well
[3905.08 → 3905.96] in John 4.
[3906.44 → 3906.62] Right?
[3906.62 → 3907.52] The Samaritan woman
[3907.52 → 3908.32] asks
[3908.32 → 3909.42] Jesus asks her
[3909.42 → 3909.90] for water
[3909.90 → 3910.66] she gets him some
[3910.66 → 3911.62] and then he tells her
[3911.62 → 3912.94] that if she knew
[3912.94 → 3913.92] who he was
[3913.92 → 3914.84] or who was speaking
[3914.84 → 3916.40] she would ask him
[3916.40 → 3917.16] for water
[3917.16 → 3918.28] and he would have
[3918.28 → 3918.74] given her
[3918.74 → 3919.68] living water
[3919.68 → 3920.54] and he says
[3920.54 → 3922.08] the water
[3922.08 → 3923.08] I give them
[3923.08 → 3923.74] will become
[3923.74 → 3924.24] in them
[3924.24 → 3925.66] a spring of water
[3925.66 → 3926.38] welling up
[3926.38 → 3928.28] to eternal life.
[3929.66 → 3930.12] And so here
[3930.12 → 3930.98] you have this picture
[3930.98 → 3932.98] in Revelation 22
[3932.98 → 3934.22] sort of working
[3934.22 → 3935.26] It's way backwards
[3935.26 → 3936.82] through history
[3936.82 → 3937.58] right?
[3937.66 → 3938.32] To see
[3938.32 → 3939.18] that the water
[3939.18 → 3940.10] Jesus is talking
[3940.10 → 3941.14] about in John 4
[3941.14 → 3942.56] is this spring
[3942.56 → 3943.90] of living water
[3943.90 → 3944.94] that runs
[3944.94 → 3945.72] through the city.
[3946.68 → 3947.24] Right?
[3947.28 → 3948.16] In John 4
[3948.16 → 3949.48] and in Revelation 22
[3949.48 → 3950.06] right?
[3950.12 → 3951.10] This living water
[3951.10 → 3952.42] is about the gift
[3952.42 → 3953.42] of restored
[3953.42 → 3954.26] relationship
[3954.26 → 3955.22] to God
[3955.22 → 3955.94] is about the gift
[3955.94 → 3956.74] of restored
[3956.74 → 3957.78] shalom.
[3958.74 → 3958.84] Right?
[3958.86 → 3959.50] That's what the woman
[3959.50 → 3960.08] at the well
[3960.08 → 3961.18] thirsted for
[3961.18 → 3962.78] this sense of wholeness
[3962.78 → 3963.46] and fullness
[3963.46 → 3964.68] and completeness
[3964.68 → 3965.22] that's what you
[3965.22 → 3965.70] and I
[3965.70 → 3966.70] are constantly
[3966.70 → 3967.82] thirsting for
[3967.82 → 3968.94] and looking for
[3968.94 → 3969.38] that's what we
[3969.38 → 3970.18] are longing for
[3970.18 → 3970.62] that's what we
[3970.62 → 3971.92] are trying to find
[3971.92 → 3973.50] in comfort culture
[3973.50 → 3974.34] or in any other
[3974.34 → 3974.92] substitute
[3974.92 → 3975.90] for shalom
[3975.90 → 3977.22] this is what
[3977.22 → 3978.46] and whom
[3978.46 → 3979.50] you are
[3979.50 → 3980.42] parched
[3980.42 → 3981.26] without.
[3983.82 → 3984.88] John continues
[3984.88 → 3985.48] he goes on
[3985.48 → 3985.72] he says
[3985.72 → 3986.48] on each side
[3986.48 → 3987.02] of the river
[3987.02 → 3988.20] stood the tree
[3988.20 → 3988.80] of life
[3988.80 → 3989.00] now
[3989.00 → 3990.46] I don't know
[3990.46 → 3991.54] how that is possible
[3991.54 → 3992.06] right?
[3992.16 → 3992.66] That there's
[3992.66 → 3993.56] one river
[3993.56 → 3994.08] and on each
[3994.08 → 3994.48] side of it
[3994.48 → 3994.94] there's one
[3994.94 → 3995.30] tree
[3995.30 → 3996.50] now
[3996.50 → 3997.08] I mean
[3997.08 → 3997.32] you might
[3997.32 → 3997.90] picture some
[3997.90 → 3998.70] fantastic root
[3998.70 → 3999.04] structure
[3999.04 → 3999.54] that's fine
[3999.54 → 4000.72] the point is
[4000.72 → 4001.24] not that it
[4001.24 → 4001.66] makes sense
[4001.66 → 4002.18] but that it is
[4002.18 → 4002.78] this compelling
[4002.78 → 4003.86] image of this
[4003.86 → 4004.62] massive tree
[4004.62 → 4005.18] and that the
[4005.18 → 4006.18] water is
[4006.18 → 4007.08] flowing out
[4007.08 → 4007.82] and through
[4007.82 → 4008.52] and to
[4008.52 → 4009.32] you
[4009.32 → 4010.80] right?
[4010.86 → 4011.50] And on this
[4011.50 → 4012.06] tree
[4012.06 → 4013.74] on each side
[4013.74 → 4014.06] of the river
[4014.06 → 4014.60] stood the tree
[4014.60 → 4015.04] of life
[4015.04 → 4015.84] bearing twelve
[4015.84 → 4016.82] crops of fruit
[4016.82 → 4017.74] yielding its
[4017.74 → 4018.80] fruit every month
[4018.80 → 4019.48] and the leaves
[4019.48 → 4019.98] of the tree
[4019.98 → 4020.58] are for the
[4020.58 → 4020.94] healing
[4020.94 → 4022.20] of nations
[4022.20 → 4023.80] and again
[4023.80 → 4024.86] right?
[4024.98 → 4025.52] If you are
[4025.52 → 4026.44] holding Genesis
[4026.44 → 4027.22] one and two
[4027.22 → 4028.08] in your mind
[4028.08 → 4028.66] as we are
[4028.66 → 4029.14] reading this
[4029.14 → 4029.42] story
[4029.42 → 4030.00] we are taken
[4030.00 → 4031.26] back to the
[4031.26 → 4031.60] garden
[4031.60 → 4032.76] and in the
[4032.76 → 4033.46] garden of Eden
[4033.46 → 4033.88] right?
[4033.98 → 4034.20] You remember
[4034.20 → 4034.64] the story
[4034.64 → 4035.18] there are
[4035.18 → 4035.84] how many
[4035.84 → 4036.22] trees?
[4036.90 → 4037.40] Two
[4037.40 → 4038.62] right?
[4038.66 → 4039.06] The tree
[4039.06 → 4039.62] of the knowledge
[4039.62 → 4040.44] of good and evil
[4040.44 → 4041.00] that's what
[4041.00 → 4041.88] Adam and Eve
[4041.88 → 4042.64] ate
[4042.64 → 4044.02] and the fruit
[4044.02 → 4044.74] from which
[4044.74 → 4045.08] was the
[4045.08 → 4045.50] temptation
[4045.50 → 4046.34] by the serpent
[4046.34 → 4047.20] and there
[4047.20 → 4048.02] is the tree
[4048.02 → 4049.12] of life
[4049.12 → 4049.78] that stood
[4049.78 → 4050.76] in the garden
[4050.76 → 4051.74] and the tree
[4051.74 → 4052.18] of life
[4052.18 → 4052.70] being there
[4052.70 → 4053.34] is the reason
[4053.34 → 4053.78] that God
[4053.78 → 4054.60] had to expel
[4054.60 → 4055.14] them after
[4055.14 → 4055.64] eating from
[4055.64 → 4056.02] the tree
[4056.02 → 4056.48] of knowledge
[4056.48 → 4057.14] of good and evil
[4057.14 → 4057.58] so that they
[4057.58 → 4058.30] might not also
[4058.30 → 4058.90] eat of the tree
[4058.90 → 4059.26] of life
[4059.26 → 4060.26] and live forever
[4060.26 → 4060.90] in their sin
[4060.90 → 4062.52] but now
[4062.52 → 4064.18] in Revelation 22
[4064.18 → 4066.10] there's one tree
[4066.10 → 4068.96] you might ask
[4068.96 → 4069.54] where's the other
[4069.54 → 4069.86] tree?
[4071.14 → 4072.00] That tree
[4072.00 → 4073.30] has been felled
[4073.30 → 4075.56] that tree
[4075.56 → 4076.20] has been chopped
[4076.20 → 4076.62] down
[4076.62 → 4077.52] that tree
[4077.52 → 4078.16] has been shaped
[4078.16 → 4079.02] into a cross
[4079.02 → 4079.80] and on it
[4079.80 → 4080.20] hung
[4080.20 → 4081.14] Jesus
[4081.14 → 4083.36] Jesus
[4083.36 → 4084.36] who lived
[4084.36 → 4084.82] the life
[4084.82 → 4085.34] that we were
[4085.34 → 4086.28] supposed to live
[4086.28 → 4086.94] giving us
[4086.94 → 4088.00] his good
[4088.00 → 4089.06] and Jesus
[4089.06 → 4089.62] who died
[4089.62 → 4090.12] the death
[4090.12 → 4091.14] that we deserved
[4091.14 → 4092.34] and died
[4092.34 → 4092.76] the death
[4092.76 → 4093.46] that was punishment
[4093.46 → 4094.24] for us
[4094.24 → 4095.54] taking on him
[4095.54 → 4096.82] our evil
[4096.82 → 4097.50] right?
[4097.60 → 4098.58] Good and evil
[4098.58 → 4099.52] on this tree
[4099.52 → 4100.26] cut down
[4100.26 → 4101.02] into the shape
[4101.02 → 4102.18] of a Roman cross
[4102.18 → 4102.84] so that now
[4102.84 → 4103.96] we might be able
[4103.96 → 4105.08] to eat of the tree
[4105.08 → 4105.74] of life
[4105.74 → 4106.90] in this new
[4106.90 → 4107.50] garden
[4107.50 → 4108.10] in the midst
[4108.10 → 4108.78] of a city
[4108.78 → 4109.82] restored
[4109.82 → 4111.22] to God
[4111.22 → 4115.06] that's our
[4115.06 → 4115.94] compelling vision
[4115.94 → 4116.60] of Shalom
[4116.60 → 4118.24] and it's now
[4118.24 → 4119.30] these two trees
[4119.30 → 4119.70] together
[4119.70 → 4120.48] the one that was
[4120.48 → 4121.08] felled
[4121.08 → 4122.14] and on which
[4122.14 → 4123.06] Jesus died
[4123.06 → 4123.78] and the one
[4123.78 → 4124.70] in that future
[4124.70 → 4125.54] garden
[4125.54 → 4126.38] restored
[4126.38 → 4127.30] that bring
[4127.30 → 4128.08] peace
[4128.08 → 4129.46] right?
[4129.54 → 4130.54] Eating of the first
[4130.54 → 4131.28] tree broke
[4131.28 → 4131.84] Shalom
[4131.84 → 4132.88] Jesus dying
[4132.88 → 4133.96] on that tree
[4133.96 → 4134.74] made restoration
[4134.74 → 4135.68] possible
[4135.68 → 4136.42] and the second
[4136.42 → 4136.82] tree
[4136.82 → 4138.00] is a picture
[4138.00 → 4139.04] of Shalom
[4139.04 → 4140.14] restored
[4140.14 → 4141.38] the healing
[4141.38 → 4142.76] of the nations
[4142.76 → 4145.32] for to us
[4145.32 → 4146.02] a child
[4146.02 → 4146.76] is born
[4146.76 → 4147.68] to us
[4147.68 → 4148.26] a son
[4148.26 → 4148.92] is given
[4148.92 → 4149.70] and the government
[4149.70 → 4150.96] will be on his
[4150.96 → 4151.74] shoulders
[4151.74 → 4152.44] the healing
[4152.44 → 4153.18] of the nations
[4153.18 → 4154.62] and he will be called
[4154.62 → 4155.86] wonderful counsellor
[4155.86 → 4156.94] mighty God
[4156.94 → 4158.38] everlasting father
[4158.38 → 4159.80] prince
[4159.80 → 4162.08] of Shalom
[4162.08 → 4165.42] no longer
[4165.42 → 4166.22] will there be
[4166.22 → 4166.70] any
[4166.70 → 4167.74] curse
[4167.74 → 4169.46] there will be
[4169.46 → 4169.84] Shalom
[4169.84 → 4171.46] what was broken
[4171.46 → 4172.56] is made
[4172.56 → 4173.00] whole
[4173.00 → 4174.10] what was destroyed
[4174.10 → 4175.30] is restored
[4175.30 → 4176.54] what was rejected
[4176.54 → 4178.26] is reconciled
[4178.26 → 4179.40] what was lost
[4179.40 → 4180.58] is found
[4180.58 → 4181.28] the curse
[4181.28 → 4181.92] has ended
[4181.92 → 4183.04] and the serpent's
[4183.04 → 4183.36] head
[4183.36 → 4184.40] has been
[4184.40 → 4185.20] crushed
[4185.20 → 4186.98] the throne
[4186.98 → 4187.58] of God
[4187.58 → 4188.30] and of the Lamb
[4188.30 → 4188.92] will be
[4188.92 → 4190.06] in that city
[4190.06 → 4191.00] that is the new
[4191.00 → 4191.58] Jerusalem
[4191.58 → 4192.24] the city
[4192.24 → 4193.10] come down
[4193.10 → 4194.02] heaven come down
[4194.02 → 4194.68] so that heaven
[4194.68 → 4195.24] and earth
[4195.24 → 4196.56] now are one
[4196.56 → 4197.60] and the same
[4197.60 → 4199.04] this is the end
[4199.04 → 4199.74] of history
[4199.74 → 4201.18] this is the future
[4201.18 → 4202.12] that we are waiting
[4202.12 → 4202.42] for
[4202.42 → 4203.24] this is the
[4203.24 → 4203.96] Shalom
[4203.96 → 4204.88] that our hearts
[4204.88 → 4205.54] are created
[4205.54 → 4206.12] to live
[4206.12 → 4207.00] in the midst
[4207.00 → 4207.38] of
[4207.38 → 4209.42] living in the
[4209.42 → 4210.42] presence of God
[4210.42 → 4211.38] right
[4211.38 → 4212.52] Forum Do
[4212.52 → 4213.26] is the Latin
[4213.26 → 4213.84] phrase there
[4213.84 → 4215.10] before his
[4215.10 → 4215.96] face
[4215.96 → 4217.58] and his
[4217.58 → 4218.20] servants
[4218.20 → 4220.30] will serve him
[4220.30 → 4223.60] now maybe that
[4223.60 → 4224.40] sounds like a
[4224.40 → 4224.92] tautology
[4224.92 → 4225.80] because servants
[4225.80 → 4226.36] serve
[4226.36 → 4227.24] that's what they
[4227.24 → 4227.58] do
[4227.58 → 4228.26] right
[4228.26 → 4228.92] they're doing
[4228.92 → 4229.98] is what they
[4229.98 → 4230.66] are defined
[4230.66 → 4231.32] as
[4231.32 → 4232.08] what they're
[4232.08 → 4233.26] made to do
[4233.26 → 4233.60] right
[4233.60 → 4234.04] there's a
[4234.04 → 4234.62] fulfilling
[4234.62 → 4235.82] of purpose
[4235.82 → 4237.02] and identity
[4237.02 → 4238.48] that is found
[4238.48 → 4239.70] only in this
[4239.70 → 4240.54] picture of
[4240.54 → 4241.00] Shalom
[4241.00 → 4241.92] restored
[4241.92 → 4243.22] restored
[4243.22 → 4243.88] to God
[4243.88 → 4244.58] in the
[4244.58 → 4246.26] almost home
[4246.26 → 4246.78] that we have
[4246.78 → 4247.14] been singing
[4247.14 → 4247.76] about this
[4247.76 → 4248.26] Advent and
[4248.26 → 4248.56] Christmas
[4248.56 → 4251.60] but if you
[4251.60 → 4252.10] are wondering
[4252.10 → 4253.08] what that
[4253.08 → 4254.08] serving might
[4254.08 → 4254.96] look like
[4254.96 → 4256.20] hear this
[4256.20 → 4257.88] the word
[4257.88 → 4258.98] that John
[4258.98 → 4259.56] uses
[4259.56 → 4260.26] right
[4260.26 → 4260.76] when he says
[4260.76 → 4261.42] that servants
[4261.42 → 4262.62] will serve
[4262.62 → 4262.94] him
[4262.94 → 4263.68] is a word
[4263.68 → 4264.20] that is
[4264.20 → 4264.88] ordinarily
[4264.88 → 4265.60] translated
[4265.60 → 4267.24] as worship
[4267.24 → 4270.16] it can
[4270.16 → 4270.44] mean
[4270.44 → 4270.96] serve
[4270.96 → 4272.60] but only
[4272.60 → 4273.10] ever
[4273.10 → 4273.50] is it
[4273.50 → 4273.76] used
[4273.76 → 4274.04] in the
[4274.04 → 4274.32] Bible
[4274.32 → 4274.68] in the
[4274.68 → 4275.18] context
[4275.18 → 4275.60] of
[4275.60 → 4276.26] worship
[4276.26 → 4277.02] of serving
[4277.02 → 4277.48] in the
[4277.48 → 4277.86] temple
[4277.86 → 4278.56] or of
[4278.56 → 4278.92] serving
[4278.92 → 4279.36] God
[4279.36 → 4279.74] as you
[4279.74 → 4280.48] worship
[4280.48 → 4280.82] him
[4280.82 → 4281.46] right
[4281.46 → 4281.64] and
[4281.64 → 4282.26] Jesus
[4282.26 → 4283.02] summarizes
[4283.02 → 4283.46] the law
[4283.46 → 4283.92] he says
[4283.92 → 4284.28] worship
[4284.28 → 4284.64] the Lord
[4284.64 → 4285.12] your God
[4285.12 → 4285.50] and
[4285.50 → 4287.38] serve
[4287.38 → 4287.92] him
[4287.92 → 4288.80] only
[4288.80 → 4289.76] right
[4289.76 → 4289.96] that's
[4289.96 → 4290.44] the same
[4290.44 → 4291.26] word
[4291.26 → 4292.80] in Revelation
[4292.80 → 4293.92] 7 15
[4293.92 → 4295.50] John sees
[4295.50 → 4295.90] a great
[4295.90 → 4296.40] multitude
[4296.40 → 4297.16] in white
[4297.16 → 4297.56] robes
[4297.56 → 4297.78] who are
[4297.78 → 4297.98] there
[4297.98 → 4298.54] worshipping
[4298.54 → 4298.80] God
[4298.80 → 4299.06] and he
[4299.06 → 4299.36] writes
[4299.36 → 4300.00] therefore
[4300.00 → 4300.64] they are
[4300.64 → 4301.28] before the
[4301.28 → 4301.58] throne
[4301.58 → 4302.14] of God
[4302.14 → 4303.14] and serve
[4303.14 → 4304.08] him day
[4304.08 → 4304.82] and night
[4304.82 → 4305.58] in his
[4305.58 → 4305.92] temple
[4305.92 → 4306.50] right
[4306.50 → 4307.10] there is a
[4307.10 → 4307.48] sense
[4307.48 → 4308.12] of the
[4308.12 → 4309.36] perpetuity
[4309.36 → 4310.36] of their
[4310.36 → 4311.02] worship
[4311.02 → 4311.26] the
[4311.26 → 4312.54] endlessness
[4312.54 → 4313.38] of their
[4313.38 → 4313.80] worship
[4313.80 → 4314.26] and
[4314.26 → 4314.72] right
[4314.72 → 4315.20] it is a
[4315.20 → 4315.60] worship
[4315.60 → 4316.82] that works
[4316.82 → 4318.16] it is a
[4318.16 → 4318.50] singing
[4318.50 → 4319.00] by
[4319.00 → 4319.94] service
[4319.94 → 4321.74] and until
[4321.74 → 4322.28] the day
[4322.28 → 4322.64] that we
[4322.64 → 4323.50] are actually
[4323.50 → 4324.20] home
[4324.20 → 4325.02] restored
[4325.02 → 4325.84] in relationship
[4325.84 → 4326.32] to God
[4326.32 → 4326.78] in this
[4326.78 → 4327.46] new city
[4327.46 → 4327.94] with this
[4327.94 → 4328.28] beautiful
[4328.28 → 4328.64] garden
[4328.64 → 4329.44] through it
[4329.44 → 4330.32] until that
[4330.32 → 4330.66] day
[4330.66 → 4331.42] we sing
[4331.42 → 4331.98] almost
[4331.98 → 4332.36] home
[4332.36 → 4333.78] right
[4333.78 → 4334.04] and it
[4334.04 → 4334.84] is now
[4334.84 → 4335.76] in our
[4335.76 → 4336.44] worship
[4336.44 → 4337.40] that we
[4337.40 → 4338.24] anticipate
[4338.24 → 4339.10] shalom
[4339.10 → 4339.94] restored
[4339.94 → 4342.00] but what
[4342.00 → 4343.08] we experience
[4343.08 → 4343.92] now in
[4343.92 → 4344.94] our hearts
[4344.94 → 4346.12] by worshipping
[4346.12 → 4346.38] God
[4346.38 → 4346.74] we will
[4346.74 → 4347.44] experience
[4347.44 → 4348.26] then in
[4348.26 → 4349.26] every aspect
[4349.26 → 4349.76] of whom
[4349.76 → 4350.28] we are
[4350.28 → 4351.50] and what
[4351.50 → 4351.92] we do
[4351.92 → 4354.02] and so
[4354.02 → 4355.00] in just a
[4355.00 → 4355.26] moment
[4355.26 → 4355.72] we are going
[4355.72 → 4356.12] to sing
[4356.12 → 4356.52] together
[4356.52 → 4357.00] by the
[4357.00 → 4357.38] sea of
[4357.38 → 4357.64] crystal
[4357.64 → 4357.90] and I'm
[4357.90 → 4358.00] going to
[4358.00 → 4358.40] invite the
[4358.40 → 4358.86] worship team
[4358.86 → 4359.32] to come up
[4359.32 → 4359.64] at this
[4359.64 → 4359.88] point
[4359.88 → 4360.30] so that we
[4360.30 → 4361.04] can jump
[4361.04 → 4361.54] right into
[4361.54 → 4362.04] that as
[4362.04 → 4362.36] our
[4362.36 → 4363.14] culminating
[4363.14 → 4364.02] prayer
[4364.02 → 4365.02] together
[4365.02 → 4367.94] worship
[4367.94 → 4369.08] now
[4369.08 → 4370.32] in this
[4370.32 → 4370.80] life
[4370.80 → 4372.10] in the
[4372.10 → 4372.50] midst of
[4372.50 → 4372.94] chaos
[4372.94 → 4373.84] in the
[4373.84 → 4374.18] midst of
[4374.18 → 4374.64] disorder
[4374.64 → 4375.02] in the
[4375.02 → 4375.50] midst of
[4375.50 → 4376.10] struggle
[4376.10 → 4376.72] in the
[4376.72 → 4377.06] midst of
[4377.06 → 4377.60] the hardships
[4377.60 → 4378.10] that we
[4378.10 → 4378.40] face
[4378.40 → 4378.82] and all
[4378.82 → 4379.22] the rest
[4379.22 → 4379.74] whatever it

[4427.68 → 4428.28] all you
[4428.28 → 4428.92] hear is
[4428.92 → 4429.52] the droning
[4429.52 → 4430.26] voice of
[4430.26 → 4430.68] shame

[4444.90 → 4446.02] come for
[4446.02 → 4446.76] shalom

[4449.02 → 4449.56] the truth
[4449.56 → 4450.08] of God
[4450.08 → 4450.40] for the
