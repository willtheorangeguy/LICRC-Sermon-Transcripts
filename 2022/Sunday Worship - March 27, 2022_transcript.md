[0.00 --> 13.20]  The kind of daring expectation that every prayer I make is on an empty grave.
[14.40 --> 20.86]  And that's the power of your name, just a mention makes a way.
[21.26 --> 26.60]  Shining for his strongholds break and there is healing.
[26.60 --> 30.60]  And that's the power that I claim.
[30.94 --> 34.04]  It's the same that roved the grave.
[34.10 --> 39.54]  And there's no power like the mighty name of Jesus.
[40.48 --> 46.08]  There's no power like the mighty name of Jesus.
[47.58 --> 50.90]  I see you taking ground.
[51.56 --> 54.28]  I see you pressing ahead.
[54.28 --> 59.42]  Your power is dangerous to the enemy's camp.
[60.72 --> 63.56]  You still do miracles.
[64.30 --> 67.40]  And you will do what you said.
[67.74 --> 72.56]  For you're the same God now as you've always been.
[72.56 --> 76.90]  And that's the power of your name.
[76.90 --> 79.90]  Your kingdom moving in.
[80.54 --> 84.28]  Your victory claims the ground of the enemy.
[85.28 --> 86.48]  Yes, it did.
[86.48 --> 87.38]  Yes, it did.
[87.38 --> 89.48]  You still do miracles.
[90.24 --> 92.90]  And you will do what you said.
[93.76 --> 98.24]  For you're the same God now as you've always been.
[98.24 --> 100.24]  And that's the power of your name.
[100.24 --> 101.92]  And that's the power of your name.
[101.92 --> 105.22]  Just a mention makes a way.
[105.58 --> 108.42]  Die is false, strongholds break.
[108.68 --> 110.92]  And there is healing.
[110.92 --> 114.92]  That's the power that I claim.
[114.92 --> 118.36]  It's the same that roved the grave.
[118.42 --> 123.96]  And there's no power like the mighty name of Jesus.
[123.96 --> 136.96]  There's no power like the mighty name of Jesus.
[136.96 --> 166.94]  God bless you.
[166.96 --> 168.72]  God bless you.
[181.20 --> 183.18]  Amen.
[183.18 --> 185.86]  Amen.
[187.12 --> 189.50]  Manatee.

[196.86 --> 196.88]  Amen.
[196.88 --> 196.92]  Amen.
[196.92 --> 218.40]  Please stand together as we sing our opening song.
[226.92 --> 247.90]  All who are thirsty, all who are weak, come to the fountain.
[247.90 --> 261.90]  Give your heart in the stream of life, let the pain and the sorrow be washed away.
[261.90 --> 280.62]  In the ways of His mercy, as deep rise out to thee, we sing, come, Lord Jesus, come.
[280.62 --> 289.62]  Come, Lord Jesus, come.
[291.62 --> 298.62]  Come, Lord Jesus, come.
[298.62 --> 308.62]  Come, Lord Jesus, come.
[310.62 --> 321.62]  For you are thirsty, all who are weak, come to the fountain.
[321.62 --> 333.62]  Come, Lord Jesus, come.
[333.62 --> 340.62]  He washed away in the ways of His mercy.
[340.62 --> 354.62]  As deep rise out to thee, we sing, Holy Spirit, come.
[354.62 --> 369.62]  Come, Lord Jesus, come.
[369.62 --> 375.62]  Come, Lord Jesus, come.
[375.62 --> 382.62]  Come, Lord Jesus, come.
[390.62 --> 391.62]  Good morning.
[391.62 --> 392.62]  Good morning.
[392.62 --> 395.62]  Welcome to church.
[395.62 --> 397.62]  I'm going to be my best at this.
[397.62 --> 400.62]  I'm going to be in the place here.
[400.62 --> 402.62]  Where are you?
[402.62 --> 406.62]  The Lord will be with you.
[406.62 --> 407.62]  Thank you.
[407.62 --> 408.62]  I'm going to be with you.
[408.62 --> 410.62]  I'm going to be proud.
[412.62 --> 413.62]  So, two things.
[413.62 --> 415.62]  One, we are welcoming back to Mexico, Michigan.
[415.62 --> 416.62]  They are here with us.
[416.62 --> 422.62]  Two, this week we welcomed Columbia and Recording family here at our church.
[422.62 --> 426.62]  And we are grateful for the response to their teaching and welcoming them.
[426.62 --> 427.62]  And they are here with us.
[427.62 --> 429.62]  It's done for us.
[429.62 --> 433.62]  And so, I encourage you to reach out to them, especially if you know Spanish, because they
[433.62 --> 435.62]  don't know any English.
[435.62 --> 440.62]  And so, if you just know a little bit of Spanish, I'm just going to be a particular here.
[440.62 --> 444.62]  And welcome them with us this morning.
[444.62 --> 445.62]  My name is Chris.
[445.62 --> 446.62]  My mom is a pastor here.
[446.62 --> 449.62]  And my brother is one of these other on stage.
[449.62 --> 450.62]  And two more dads.
[450.62 --> 453.62]  We came to work together this morning.
[453.62 --> 454.62]  Good morning.
[454.62 --> 455.62]  If you're visiting us soon, we welcome you.
[455.62 --> 457.62]  And we're grateful that you are here.
[457.62 --> 460.62]  If you're joining us online, we welcome you as well.
[460.62 --> 465.62]  If you're here present with us this morning, following our worship, we have a time to pop the
[465.62 --> 466.62]  after.
[466.62 --> 468.62]  And so, everyone invited us to sit around the back.
[468.62 --> 474.62]  If you are willing to be comfortable to do that, we encourage you to join in your fellowship
[474.62 --> 475.62]  in that way.
[475.62 --> 481.62]  If you're feeling that way, we're going to be comfortable with that.
[481.62 --> 487.62]  As we gather in God's presence to me, our friends, us, and so I invite you to receive
[487.62 --> 490.62]  the greeting of our prayer.
[490.62 --> 494.62]  Christ, mercy, and peace to you.
[494.62 --> 499.62]  From God, our Father, and the Lord, who is Christ, the Son, and our Savior, through the
[499.62 --> 502.62]  presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[502.62 --> 503.62]  Amen.
[503.62 --> 506.62]  For you, God, our Father.
[506.62 --> 512.62]  As we've come to worship this morning, on this fourth Sunday of Lent, let's take to
[512.62 --> 518.62]  heart these words from Philippians 2, verses 9 to 11.
[518.62 --> 519.62]  Amen.
[519.62 --> 521.62]  We art as we truly do so.
[521.62 --> 522.62]  Amen.
[522.62 --> 523.62]  Amen.
[523.62 --> 525.62]  We mustah Mormon, many things store us heard and bear them in the United States morning.
[525.62 --> 526.62]  That in the door, again, saying that's how fast it is to work it and may be less than
[526.62 --> 527.62]  even the actual false Platinum teaching.
[527.62 --> 528.62]  To see God let us gel out in the name of the Father.
[528.62 --> 529.62]  violeth hearing the Lord, they have in the name of the Son, that may be desired but also
[529.62 --> 531.44] enn 보니까 his sweet son, that was long, the fruit whom heareth cooper actually

[533.62 --> 534.62]  And every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[534.62 --> 537.62]  The one thing we seek to do this, that was holy in the name of Jesus.
[537.62 --> 539.62]  In the name of the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and
[539.62 --> 567.32]  I love you, Lord, and I lift my voice
[567.32 --> 579.32]  To worship you, O my soul, rejoice
[579.32 --> 591.82]  Take joy, my King, in what you hear
[591.82 --> 604.82]  May it be a sweet, sweet sound in your ear

[793.82 --> 802.82]  We love You, Lord, and we exalt Your name. May our souls forever be overcome in worship of You.
[802.82 --> 832.82] 
[832.82 --> 837.82]  Through the sacrifice of Jesus, we pray for Your forgiveness.
[837.82 --> 844.82]  As we gaze at the empty tomb on that first Easter morning, we see the hope of eternal life with You.
[844.82 --> 853.82]  Holy Spirit, help us to delight more and more in Your will, and walk in Your ways to the glory of Jesus' name. Amen.
[853.82 --> 862.82]  For the sacrifice of Jesus, we pray for Your forgiveness.

[932.82 --> 946.82]  And the Lord is good to all. He has compassion in all that He has made.

[959.82 --> 972.82]  As far as the east is from the west, that's how far He has removed our transgressions from us.

[1722.36 --> 1723.28]  Your pants fell down.
[1723.50 --> 1723.84]  Oh, dear.
[1723.98 --> 1725.02]  These pants fell down.
[1725.32 --> 1726.28]  These ones always fell down.
[1726.28 --> 1727.78]  We need a belt over there.
[1730.64 --> 1731.54]  Come on up.
[1732.34 --> 1732.86]  All right.
[1733.68 --> 1739.86]  So today I brought this nice bright green bag, and in it it has some clues for the story
[1739.86 --> 1742.74]  we're going to learn about in children's worship time.
[1743.64 --> 1746.76]  You might, and I'm not going to tell you at Kids' Corner what the story is.
[1746.82 --> 1750.00]  You'll figure that out later, so it'll just be like a surprise if you're not sure.
[1750.00 --> 1756.08]  But I'm going to pull out four different items, and then we'll see what they are, and then
[1756.08 --> 1759.40]  we'll see if we can figure out the story or not either way.
[1759.84 --> 1761.08]  So I have this first.
[1761.62 --> 1762.06]  Lamb.
[1762.58 --> 1763.42]  A lamb.
[1764.00 --> 1764.58]  A sheep.
[1765.32 --> 1770.08]  So can you think of any stories in the Bible that have to do with lambs?
[1770.32 --> 1771.36]  About the flocks.
[1771.62 --> 1772.74]  About the flocks, yeah.
[1773.50 --> 1774.34]  What do we think?
[1774.86 --> 1775.30]  Do you know?
[1776.28 --> 1777.26]  Can't remember the name.
[1777.32 --> 1778.04]  What do you think, Hayley?
[1778.04 --> 1780.32]  The bear and the lion.
[1780.64 --> 1780.88]  Yeah.
[1781.26 --> 1783.18]  There's a bear and a lion.
[1783.70 --> 1784.40]  A shepherd.
[1784.62 --> 1785.16]  A shepherd.
[1785.32 --> 1786.02]  Something about a shepherd.
[1786.32 --> 1786.50]  Okay.
[1786.54 --> 1787.10]  Let's put it here.
[1787.18 --> 1788.46]  So we have a lamb.
[1789.02 --> 1789.66]  That's one thing.
[1789.76 --> 1791.10]  Because remember, there's four clues.
[1791.50 --> 1793.82]  So the next one is this here.
[1794.36 --> 1794.76]  Money.
[1794.76 --> 1795.12]  Money.
[1795.62 --> 1795.88]  Money.
[1798.08 --> 1799.98]  What kind of money is this?
[1800.10 --> 1800.92]  Like coins.
[1801.02 --> 1801.42]  That's right.
[1801.46 --> 1802.32]  And what color are they?
[1803.10 --> 1803.54]  Silver.
[1803.80 --> 1804.10]  Silver.
[1804.26 --> 1805.58]  How many do you think are in here?
[1805.86 --> 1806.22]  Ten.
[1806.22 --> 1806.54]  Five.
[1806.96 --> 1807.36]  Ten.
[1807.36 --> 1807.86]  Five.
[1808.04 --> 1810.00]  Two hundred.
[1810.24 --> 1811.38]  Maybe a little more than five.
[1811.46 --> 1811.92]  What do you think?
[1812.16 --> 1813.12]  Probably eighteen.
[1813.60 --> 1813.98]  Eighteen.
[1814.02 --> 1814.86]  Maybe about thirty.
[1815.36 --> 1816.88]  That's a really good guess.
[1817.02 --> 1817.42]  Fifteen.
[1817.42 --> 1819.02]  I think there's about thirty in here.
[1819.16 --> 1820.54]  Thirty silver coins.
[1821.18 --> 1822.22]  So let's put those by the...
[1822.22 --> 1824.58]  I knocked them over.
[1825.30 --> 1825.52]  Okay.
[1825.58 --> 1826.66]  I got something else here.
[1827.04 --> 1827.82]  Pizza dough.
[1828.18 --> 1828.80]  Pizza dough.
[1829.30 --> 1833.62]  I do use this for pizza, but I would say it's part of the bread category.
[1834.46 --> 1834.96]  Nan bread.
[1835.10 --> 1835.86]  Nan bread.
[1835.86 --> 1835.92]  Nan bread.
[1836.42 --> 1837.42]  It's nan bread.
[1837.42 --> 1838.70]  Bread with some more.
[1838.78 --> 1839.36]  Nan bread.
[1839.44 --> 1841.74]  Can you think of any times we talk about bread in the Bible?
[1842.98 --> 1843.38]  Jesus.
[1843.96 --> 1844.80]  The Last Supper.
[1845.46 --> 1846.28]  The Last Supper.
[1846.54 --> 1846.96]  Oh, wow.
[1847.02 --> 1848.58]  That was an excellent guess.
[1848.74 --> 1849.04]  Jesus.
[1849.32 --> 1849.56]  Okay.
[1849.62 --> 1851.38]  We got one more thing here in this.
[1851.42 --> 1852.34]  This is the biggest one.
[1853.16 --> 1853.70]  A bowl.
[1853.82 --> 1854.38]  A bowl.
[1855.26 --> 1856.30]  And it has two...
[1856.30 --> 1856.98]  It's a two-parter.
[1857.32 --> 1857.76]  Towel.
[1857.98 --> 1858.26]  Yeah.
[1858.80 --> 1860.12]  What do you think you could do with this?
[1860.62 --> 1861.62]  It's for dinner.
[1862.30 --> 1862.58]  Work.
[1862.80 --> 1863.22]  For dinner?
[1863.22 --> 1865.94]  What would you do with a bowl and a cloth, Julia?
[1866.02 --> 1867.24]  Oh, I would make dinner.
[1867.50 --> 1867.70]  Sorry?
[1868.70 --> 1869.34]  Clean your feet?
[1869.42 --> 1870.60]  Is that how you clean your feet at home?
[1872.24 --> 1873.46]  But that's a great guess.
[1873.50 --> 1876.04]  You could use it to clean things, like maybe your feet.
[1876.16 --> 1877.60]  We might hear about that in the story.
[1878.34 --> 1879.56]  Do you guys need to clean your feet?
[1879.62 --> 1880.40]  Are they stinky today?
[1880.96 --> 1881.68]  Well, yeah.
[1881.68 --> 1882.40]  All right.
[1882.48 --> 1883.70]  So those are our four things.
[1883.84 --> 1886.94]  Now, I'm going to bring them over when we do the story, and we'll see how they all fit
[1886.94 --> 1889.52]  together for what we're going to learn about today.
[1889.60 --> 1892.42]  We had some really good guesses, maybe even some correct guesses.
[1893.02 --> 1895.42]  So we're going to pray, and then we'll do our blessing.
[1897.40 --> 1901.38]  Lord Jesus, thank you that we can come here today and worship you and learn more about
[1901.38 --> 1901.58]  you.
[1901.88 --> 1906.36]  We pray that we would have open minds to hearing your word, God, and that we would show
[1906.36 --> 1909.16]  your love to those around us as we go from here this week.
[1909.32 --> 1909.60]  Amen.
[1909.60 --> 1909.72]  Amen.
[1911.14 --> 1912.48]  All right, everyone, let's stand up.
[1920.16 --> 1921.48]  Now have our hands out.
[1922.86 --> 1923.22]  Okay.
[1924.12 --> 1926.42]  The Lord be with you.
[1926.90 --> 1928.34]  And also with you.
[1939.60 --> 1940.78]  Is this still working?
[1940.98 --> 1941.16]  Okay.
[1941.34 --> 1941.62]  Beautiful.
[1943.14 --> 1944.56]  I have to make a quick announcement.
[1944.74 --> 1947.42]  Chris made me do it now, so I'm alone.
[1948.12 --> 1948.56]  I don't know.
[1948.88 --> 1949.02]  Yeah.
[1949.02 --> 1953.14]  The Young Adults Potluck is next Sunday.
[1953.48 --> 1958.58]  So I mentioned before Mexico that the first Sunday of every month there was a Young Adults
[1958.58 --> 1962.54]  event swapping back between Board Games Night and Potlucks.
[1962.54 --> 1966.26]  So this Sunday coming up is Pollock Night at 7 p.m.
[1966.26 --> 1966.80]  at the church.
[1968.52 --> 1970.08]  Young Adults, if you didn't know that, bring a food.
[1970.36 --> 1970.82]  It would be great.
[1970.98 --> 1971.58]  It's going to be awesome.
[1974.30 --> 1974.66]  See?
[1975.30 --> 1978.76]  If that didn't inspire fun, then I don't know what would.
[1978.76 --> 1987.64]  Good morning, everybody.
[1988.00 --> 1988.82]  My name is Ken.
[1988.90 --> 1992.60]  I'm an elder here at Emmanuel, and I will lead you in our church family prayer.
[1993.02 --> 1994.00]  So let us pray.
[1994.00 --> 2003.26]  Heavenly God and Father, Lord of all creation, Yahweh, your name is above all names.
[2003.94 --> 2005.72]  Your name is worthy of all praise.
[2006.40 --> 2007.94]  It is the name above all names.
[2008.80 --> 2014.04]  Father, it is good to be here together as your people gathered in this place, not gathered
[2014.04 --> 2016.38]  in your church, but gathered as your church.
[2017.12 --> 2023.40]  It is a privilege and a blessing to be here to gather in freedom and worship you in a world
[2023.40 --> 2025.26]  and culture that is pulling us away from you.
[2025.58 --> 2030.72]  It is good to stop, to take the day as you have set aside and reflect on your promises
[2030.72 --> 2032.12]  and your will for our lives.
[2033.30 --> 2037.50]  Father, we come to you as a congregation to bring our hurts and sorrow, our anxieties and
[2037.50 --> 2037.86]  fears.
[2038.62 --> 2042.40]  We live in a world where sin continues to affect us in many and different ways.
[2043.46 --> 2046.06]  Father, we pray for the war that is happening in Ukraine.
[2046.40 --> 2050.98]  We pray that you will bring peace to the region, that you will put an end to the war and to
[2050.98 --> 2053.24]  the suffering of the Ukrainian people.
[2053.40 --> 2057.32]  Lord, be with those who are trying to make their way out of the country, but also those
[2057.32 --> 2060.00]  who have stayed behind and are in the midst of danger.
[2060.44 --> 2062.62]  Lord, be their refuge in this time of trouble.
[2064.06 --> 2067.20]  Closer to home, we pray for each one of these members here.
[2067.78 --> 2070.96]  Some are still hurting from loss of loved ones.
[2071.66 --> 2073.42]  Some have physical health concerns.
[2073.86 --> 2075.14]  Some have mental health concerns.
[2075.92 --> 2077.78]  Others are feeling the effects of old age.
[2078.20 --> 2079.22]  Perhaps others are lonely.
[2079.22 --> 2084.86]  For each one who suffers, Father, be near to them and allow your spirit to be the light
[2084.86 --> 2085.72]  that they can look to.
[2087.14 --> 2091.92]  We pray for Robin's dad, William, who is suffering from a blood infection.
[2092.86 --> 2095.74]  We pray that you will be near to him and that you will grant him healing.
[2095.74 --> 2100.50]  Father, be with the marriages of this congregation.
[2101.28 --> 2105.38]  Have us look to serve the other rather than be concerned with our own wants and needs.
[2106.26 --> 2108.08]  Be with parents as they raise their children.
[2109.14 --> 2113.30]  The younger ones can be physically exhausting and the older ones can be mentally exhausting,
[2113.52 --> 2118.96]  but you have given parents the responsibility and the joy to persevere through all of these
[2118.96 --> 2122.04]  things and to raise our children to honour and serve you.
[2123.56 --> 2127.18]  As we continue to move forward after COVID restrictions are lifting,
[2127.50 --> 2131.72]  allow us to be patient and loving to those who may not be ready to move ahead quite yet.
[2132.52 --> 2137.04]  We are thankful for the loosening of restrictions and pray that COVID will remain at bay
[2137.04 --> 2138.66]  and keep us moving forward.
[2140.60 --> 2143.38]  You also allow us to experience joy and happiness,
[2143.38 --> 2146.96]  to see so many wonderful and beautiful things through your creation,
[2147.34 --> 2149.96]  through relationships, and through the work that you give us to do.
[2150.88 --> 2154.06]  We are thankful for the successful trip of our youth to Mexico.
[2155.30 --> 2158.38]  Lord, you brought them there and you brought them back safely to us.
[2158.90 --> 2162.26]  You gave them the opportunity to build relationships with the people from Mexico
[2162.26 --> 2164.50]  and to share the love of Jesus with each other.
[2165.48 --> 2168.50]  It is a wonderful thing that they were able to experience
[2168.50 --> 2172.20]  and we pray that this will further build their faith and relationship with you.
[2173.38 --> 2180.16]  Be with the Refugee Committee as they work with World Renew to finalise the application of the Namur family.
[2180.74 --> 2186.58]  If it be your will, may they make it here to Canada and begin to build a new life here.
[2187.98 --> 2193.62]  We also pray for Sebastian, Sandy, and their two children who came to the church this past week looking for help.
[2194.26 --> 2197.68]  We thank you that members of our congregation have given them a place to stay
[2197.68 --> 2200.74]  until they can sort out their situation over the next while.
[2200.74 --> 2206.64]  Lord, you brought them to our door and we pray that you will lead us to help them as you would have us do.
[2209.04 --> 2215.70]  Continue to be with all of the committees and groups, Bible studies, care groups, elders, deacons, youth, and young adults.
[2216.06 --> 2221.54]  Be with the staff of the church and help us to all know that each one of us is a spoke in the wheel of this congregation.
[2222.10 --> 2224.90]  Be with the council as they plan to meet this Tuesday
[2224.90 --> 2229.76]  and allow that meeting to be effective towards the will for this church.
[2231.44 --> 2234.24]  Lord, be with Pastor Chris this morning as he brings us your word.
[2234.88 --> 2239.80]  Open our ears, hearts, and minds so that we may learn more about your will for our lives.
[2240.18 --> 2243.16]  We pray all of this in the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[2243.16 --> 2243.56]  Amen.
[2263.56 --> 2264.90]  Yeah, sorry to disappoint, Ken.
[2264.90 --> 2272.36]  It's good to be with you all this morning.
[2272.44 --> 2274.26]  See some faces finally from the front.
[2274.36 --> 2275.38]  This is lovely as well.
[2276.00 --> 2277.62]  Work, work, work.
[2278.26 --> 2279.26]  That's what we do, right?
[2280.24 --> 2280.94]  We work.
[2281.36 --> 2283.30]  Some of us love our work.
[2284.02 --> 2284.82]  Some of us don't.
[2285.10 --> 2286.40]  Some of us love it too much.
[2286.48 --> 2288.74]  Some of us complain about it too much.
[2288.74 --> 2289.98]  But we all work.
[2291.16 --> 2293.82]  Does anybody know what the first job in the Bible was?
[2293.82 --> 2295.90]  Online, you've got about six seconds to guess.
[2295.96 --> 2296.74]  But I'm actually asking.
[2296.84 --> 2297.68]  Does somebody want to shout out?
[2297.74 --> 2299.04]  What was the first job in the Bible?
[2300.44 --> 2301.08]  Josh, not you.
[2303.24 --> 2303.60]  Sorry?
[2304.80 --> 2305.64]  Nope, nope.
[2306.98 --> 2308.38]  God gave Adam a job.
[2309.50 --> 2310.34]  Name the animals.
[2310.68 --> 2313.04]  That was the first job in the Bible.
[2313.54 --> 2318.04]  God asked Adam to name all of the animals in the world.
[2318.04 --> 2319.34]  That would have been hard, right?
[2319.42 --> 2321.02]  That would have been a hard job.
[2321.08 --> 2323.68]  You think naming your puppy or your goldfish is tricky?
[2324.28 --> 2327.26]  Imagine naming all of the animals in the world.
[2327.32 --> 2328.28]  We know it was hard too.
[2328.34 --> 2329.20]  We have proof of this.
[2329.38 --> 2331.32]  Because now we have animals like this guy.
[2331.98 --> 2332.68]  It's coming up.
[2333.76 --> 2334.84]  Maybe it's not coming up.
[2334.94 --> 2335.50]  Is it coming up?
[2335.54 --> 2335.98]  Oh, it's up.
[2336.02 --> 2336.48]  There it is.
[2337.08 --> 2337.72]  The platypus.
[2338.44 --> 2339.32]  Or this one.
[2340.96 --> 2342.56]  The screaming hairy armadillo.
[2342.86 --> 2343.96]  Or this next one.
[2345.28 --> 2347.68]  The sarcastic fringe-headed fish.
[2347.84 --> 2348.92]  That is a real thing.
[2350.04 --> 2351.48]  Those are real animals.
[2352.48 --> 2354.46]  Adam, actually, he did pretty well, all things considered.
[2354.54 --> 2359.38]  But have you ever wondered if God had given you this task today, knowing what we now know
[2359.38 --> 2362.20]  in the animal kingdom, what you would call the animals?
[2363.06 --> 2365.34]  Like, if we were given this task, what would we do?
[2365.40 --> 2371.52]  Well, here's some suggestions for better animal names from your faithful friends at the old
[2371.52 --> 2371.84]  internet.
[2371.84 --> 2374.74]  So we've got arrow pig.
[2377.88 --> 2379.64]  We've got naked snail.
[2381.26 --> 2383.22]  One of my favorites, fart squirrel.
[2386.02 --> 2387.62]  We've got furry potato.
[2387.76 --> 2388.44]  Another good one.
[2390.42 --> 2391.54]  These next three are good.
[2391.60 --> 2392.26]  We've got a nope.
[2392.26 --> 2392.34]  Nope.
[2394.98 --> 2396.48]  And then we've got a furry nope.
[2398.46 --> 2400.04]  And then finally, a nope rope.
[2402.70 --> 2405.80]  And lastly, this one was absolutely my favorite.
[2406.22 --> 2407.78]  The pantless thunder goose.
[2410.78 --> 2412.48]  Now, I know what you're thinking.
[2412.72 --> 2417.12]  What does any of this nonsense have to do with Exodus or our sermon today?
[2417.12 --> 2421.26]  And I have to admit, if I'm being very honest with you, very little.
[2421.70 --> 2425.12]  I was just trying to find a way into this message, and it seems like I came up limping
[2425.12 --> 2425.90]  a bit this morning.
[2426.28 --> 2427.44]  But we muster on.
[2427.66 --> 2429.36]  We're going to look at Sabbath rest.
[2429.48 --> 2433.64]  And so if that was what work is, we're going to talk about what rest is.
[2434.06 --> 2435.16]  We all have to work.
[2435.54 --> 2436.76]  But how do we rest?
[2436.82 --> 2438.84]  How does God call us to rest?
[2438.84 --> 2442.02]  And more specifically, what is Sabbath rest?
[2442.14 --> 2444.06]  So that's what we're going to look at today.
[2444.26 --> 2446.26]  So if you've got your Bibles, please open them up.
[2446.26 --> 2449.70]  If you've got an app on your phone with your Bible, open that up as well.
[2449.76 --> 2451.16]  At home, we invite you to do the same.
[2452.50 --> 2456.50]  As always, it'll be very handy to have that open throughout so you can follow along as
[2456.50 --> 2457.28]  this goes on.
[2457.42 --> 2463.28]  So Exodus 31 is where we're turning today as we continue our sermon series through this
[2463.28 --> 2463.84]  book.
[2463.90 --> 2467.84]  And we're going to look at verses 12 to 17 of Exodus 31.
[2467.96 --> 2469.24]  It'll be on the screen behind me as well.
[2470.12 --> 2472.32]  Exodus 31, 12 to 17 says this.
[2472.32 --> 2478.66]  Then the Lord said to Moses, say to the Israelites, you must observe my Sabbaths.
[2478.66 --> 2484.20]  This will be a sign between me and you for the generations to come, so you may know that
[2484.20 --> 2486.66]  I am the Lord who makes you holy.
[2487.94 --> 2490.70]  Observe the Sabbath because it is holy to you.
[2491.04 --> 2494.36]  Anyone who desecrates it is to be put to death.
[2495.24 --> 2498.48]  Those who do any work on that day must be cut off from their people.
[2498.48 --> 2504.10]  For six days work is to be done, but the seventh day is a day of Sabbath rest, holy to the
[2504.10 --> 2504.40]  Lord.
[2504.96 --> 2508.62]  Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day is to be put to death.
[2509.56 --> 2513.56]  The Israelites are to observe the Sabbath, celebrating it for the generations to come
[2513.56 --> 2515.20]  as a lasting covenant.
[2515.66 --> 2518.70]  It will be a sign between me and the Israelites forever.
[2519.36 --> 2524.52]  For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he rested
[2524.52 --> 2525.94]  and was refreshed.
[2526.44 --> 2527.44]  The word of the Lord.
[2528.48 --> 2534.70]  If you were here last week or watched the sermon last week, Pastor Chris led us through
[2534.70 --> 2538.08]  a sermon and he led us through the theology of the tabernacle.
[2538.60 --> 2543.30]  We looked at 15 chapters last week between Exodus 25 and 40.
[2543.30 --> 2549.50]  We looked at how God's presence in the tabernacle is, and beyond, is now known amongst the people.
[2550.02 --> 2555.24]  Well today we're looking at the Sabbath, the theology of the Sabbath, and how we come to know
[2555.24 --> 2557.30]  God through that holy time.
[2557.30 --> 2562.18]  So last week we looked at a holy place, and this week we're looking at a holy time.
[2562.30 --> 2563.66]  Place and time.
[2563.74 --> 2565.30]  That's the weekly connection.
[2565.82 --> 2570.30]  Now something else interesting to note that started last week in chapter 25, and it carries
[2570.30 --> 2571.94]  over through today, is this.
[2572.16 --> 2578.52]  When God starts discussing the tabernacle, the Bible uses the phrase, the Lord spoke to Moses
[2578.52 --> 2583.26]  seven times between Exodus 25 and Exodus 31.
[2583.26 --> 2586.82]  The first six times are connected with creating.
[2586.82 --> 2590.80]  How to go about creating things for the tabernacle.
[2590.90 --> 2596.96]  Things like sanctuary supplies, proper funding, bronze basin, anointing oil, incense, and temple furnishings.
[2596.96 --> 2605.40]  But the seventh time, the seventh time that the Bible says God spoke to Moses was today's passage about rest.
[2605.96 --> 2614.00]  So six times God spoke to Moses ways to create, and the seventh time God spoke to Moses on how to rest,
[2614.34 --> 2616.26]  which of course follows the creation account.
[2616.26 --> 2619.46]  God worked and created for six days, and on the seventh day he rested.
[2619.54 --> 2620.32]  That's pretty cool, right?
[2621.46 --> 2622.42]  So rest is important.
[2623.06 --> 2623.80]  Rest is important.
[2623.90 --> 2624.80]  It's highlighted a lot.
[2625.12 --> 2627.46]  Sabbath rest matters to God.
[2627.84 --> 2629.00]  He rested at creation.
[2629.42 --> 2632.32]  He lists it amongst the Ten Commandments in Exodus 20.
[2632.54 --> 2635.08]  He highlights it here very poignantly.
[2635.08 --> 2640.26]  And rest becomes a theme that we start seeing throughout the entire Bible.
[2640.36 --> 2641.72]  But why is this so important?
[2641.88 --> 2644.50]  Why does Sabbath rest matter?
[2645.56 --> 2648.76]  Well, looking at this text, we're going to see today that Sabbath rest matters
[2648.76 --> 2657.54]  because Sabbath is a time where we can remember God, who God is, and we can observe what he has done for us.
[2657.98 --> 2663.12]  Sabbath is a time where we can remember who God is and observe what he has done for us.
[2663.12 --> 2665.24]  That's what our text says today.
[2665.32 --> 2668.88]  If you look at verse 13, God is commanding Moses here, and he says,
[2669.40 --> 2672.92]  Say to the Israelites, you must observe my Sabbaths.
[2673.28 --> 2676.30]  This will be a sign between me and you for the generations to come,
[2676.40 --> 2681.46]  so that you may know that I am the Lord who makes you holy.
[2683.46 --> 2689.80]  So if Sabbath helps us know the one true God who makes us holy, what is Sabbath then?
[2690.30 --> 2691.66]  How should it look?
[2691.66 --> 2693.14]  Who is this for?
[2693.54 --> 2694.86]  What is Sabbath?
[2695.08 --> 2696.98]  When is Sabbath?
[2697.96 --> 2700.40]  We're going to take a peek at all of those questions today,
[2700.40 --> 2704.34]  and we're hopefully going to come to a better understanding of what Sabbath is
[2704.34 --> 2708.28]  and how Sabbath helps us know God and know the Lord.
[2708.96 --> 2711.96]  So first, how should Sabbath look?
[2712.30 --> 2714.82]  I think instantly we get stuck here, don't we?
[2715.26 --> 2719.60]  I think right out of the gate, we instantly think, what should we do?
[2719.60 --> 2722.88]  What are the things we're allowed to do, and what are the things we are not allowed to do?
[2722.94 --> 2727.66]  Or the other side of the spectrum, we think Sabbath is this old-timey thing,
[2727.70 --> 2731.44]  and it doesn't actually matter what we do so long as that we go to church at least
[2731.44 --> 2732.44]  and love God and love others.
[2733.72 --> 2736.54]  However, both of those postures actually completely miss the point.
[2736.54 --> 2744.38]  Whether we fret about what we can or can't do, or we whitewash the whole thing as this ancient ritual
[2744.38 --> 2749.22]  that doesn't matter what we do, they both focus on the things we can do.
[2750.04 --> 2751.86]  But God never says do the Sabbath.
[2752.42 --> 2753.36]  That's not the language.
[2753.36 --> 2756.32]  In Exodus 20, God calls us to remember the Sabbath.
[2757.04 --> 2760.08]  In our text today, he calls us to observe the Sabbath.
[2760.96 --> 2763.84]  This is not a matter of doing or not doing.
[2764.00 --> 2764.96]  It's a posture.
[2765.36 --> 2769.50]  It's a perspective, a lens, a way to think about things and understand.
[2771.38 --> 2772.98]  Hold on to that just for a little bit.
[2774.58 --> 2780.02]  In his book, The Rest of God, Mark Buchanan states that the two biggest obstacles
[2780.02 --> 2786.52]  that people have to properly observing the Sabbath are busyness and legalism.
[2787.82 --> 2789.48]  Some of us are too busy.
[2790.06 --> 2793.68]  We're too busy to properly observe Sabbath rest.
[2793.80 --> 2798.62]  There's too much to do, too many emails to check, too many people to chauffeur around.
[2798.94 --> 2799.90]  There's too much happening.
[2800.68 --> 2801.82]  And so we make excuses.
[2801.94 --> 2803.92]  We think, God doesn't really care if I do this, does he?
[2805.50 --> 2807.26]  But again, Sabbath isn't about doing.
[2808.06 --> 2808.92]  It's about observing.
[2808.92 --> 2814.38]  Are you really thinking about God, remembering what he's done for you,
[2814.48 --> 2819.34]  remembering that he is the Lord if you are too busy running around,
[2819.88 --> 2823.62]  running the rat race seven days a week, burning the candle at both ends?
[2824.28 --> 2830.44]  Can you really remember who God is if you don't slow down as God calls us to?
[2831.64 --> 2835.16]  Are you really resting if you're always running?
[2835.16 --> 2839.18]  The other problem is legalism.
[2839.84 --> 2845.46]  We spend what should be our Sabbath fretting about what we're doing and if we're doing it right.
[2846.12 --> 2847.26]  Can you get gas?
[2847.58 --> 2848.06]  Buy bread?
[2848.22 --> 2848.92]  Can you cook a meal?
[2849.78 --> 2850.58]  Can you host someone?
[2850.68 --> 2851.78]  Is it a day for family?
[2852.00 --> 2853.00]  A day for church family?
[2853.08 --> 2853.86]  A day for our neighbors?
[2854.20 --> 2855.26]  What about screen time?
[2855.30 --> 2856.28]  How much of that is appropriate?
[2856.54 --> 2857.44]  Can I mow the lawn?
[2857.44 --> 2861.40]  It's all rules about doing, doing, doing.
[2862.40 --> 2866.82]  Whether you can or you can't, we're concerned about what we do on the Sabbath.
[2866.90 --> 2872.72]  We either make Sabbath the same day as every other day of the week because of the life that we have
[2872.72 --> 2874.94]  and the fact that things are just too busy that we're moving through.
[2874.94 --> 2878.76]  Or we make Sabbath about rules that need to be followed.
[2879.52 --> 2883.68]  Instead about finding our rest and our hope in Jesus Christ.
[2885.60 --> 2891.98]  On our Sabbath day, we should cease doing what is necessary and embrace that which gives life.
[2892.08 --> 2893.84]  That's the quote from Mark Buchanan's book.
[2893.92 --> 2898.10]  That's how he summed up this command.
[2898.10 --> 2903.48]  So what that means is that Sabbath may look different from one person to the next.
[2903.62 --> 2906.52]  Someone who's a researcher, a scientific researcher, for example,
[2906.72 --> 2908.58]  they might not want to read on Sabbath.
[2908.92 --> 2913.46]  They might not want to read a book because reading is a necessary part of the job that they do.
[2913.80 --> 2917.74]  They might want to garden because nature is life-giving to them
[2917.74 --> 2921.40]  and piddling in their yard connects them to God who gives them life.
[2921.58 --> 2924.40]  And a landscaper, though, he might not want to piddle in his yard.
[2924.40 --> 2927.76]  He might not want to work on his lawn because he does that every day.
[2928.10 --> 2931.00]  So reading a book for him might be exactly what he needs to do.
[2931.24 --> 2932.70]  That would be life-giving for him.
[2933.06 --> 2933.80]  Or maybe not.
[2934.04 --> 2936.22]  Maybe the landscaper, maybe she needs to be outdoors.
[2936.56 --> 2940.02]  Maybe she needs to be working on her lawn because that is what's life-giving to her.
[2940.20 --> 2942.04]  That's the perfect way for her to embrace life.
[2942.24 --> 2944.62]  And maybe the researcher, maybe she loves knowledge.
[2944.88 --> 2948.94]  So maybe she should read a book on Sabbath because that is connecting her to God.
[2949.40 --> 2951.42]  Either way, you can't bubble wrap Sabbath.
[2951.56 --> 2952.64]  That's the point of this.
[2952.64 --> 2958.66]  Sabbath is a time where we can remember who God is and observe what he has done for us.
[2959.20 --> 2960.86]  So how should Sabbath look?
[2964.04 --> 2970.36]  However you need it to look so that you can cease from doing what is necessary in your life
[2970.36 --> 2974.12]  and embrace that which gives life.
[2974.12 --> 2979.30]  Because when we embrace that which gives life, we have to slow down.
[2979.92 --> 2981.06]  We have to look around.
[2981.54 --> 2984.86]  And we have to embrace the great God who made us.
[2986.76 --> 2992.50]  Sabbath is the time where we can remember who God is and observe what he has done for us.
[2994.46 --> 2996.34]  So then secondly, who is Sabbath for?
[2996.72 --> 2997.30]  Is it for you?
[2998.50 --> 2998.96]  Like, yeah.
[2999.48 --> 3000.16]  But also no.
[3000.56 --> 3001.32]  But mostly yeah.
[3001.32 --> 3006.02]  So in Mark 2, Jesus said the Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.
[3006.42 --> 3008.50]  So yes, Sabbath was made for you.
[3008.56 --> 3012.24]  But not like you, whoever I'm pointing at.
[3012.42 --> 3015.18]  But like you, everyone here.
[3015.26 --> 3017.98]  Not the singular you, but the plural you.
[3021.66 --> 3024.44]  Sabbath was not meant to be an individual thing.
[3024.88 --> 3027.64]  Or even a nuclear family thing, actually.
[3027.64 --> 3032.06]  No, Sabbath was meant for a people, for a community, for God's people.
[3032.16 --> 3034.78]  If you look at our text alone, look at the language in there.
[3035.14 --> 3038.20]  In those six verses we read today, God says the Sabbath is for this.
[3038.34 --> 3042.74]  God says the Sabbath is for the people of Israel, or the people of God.
[3042.96 --> 3043.82]  He says that three times.
[3044.32 --> 3046.40]  He says it's for people throughout the generation.
[3046.56 --> 3048.60]  He says that twice, and now we're up to five.
[3048.60 --> 3054.72]  And God calls Sabbath a lasting covenant, which is communal language, in verse 16.
[3054.96 --> 3060.12]  That's six references to Sabbath being for the community in six verses.
[3061.24 --> 3064.56]  Sabbath isn't this individual thing for you or for your immediate family.
[3064.96 --> 3066.76]  Sabbath is for all God's people.
[3067.58 --> 3068.66]  It's for your church family.
[3068.74 --> 3071.26]  It's a lasting covenant for all who believe.
[3071.26 --> 3076.04]  The Heidelberg Catechism highlights this communal truth in this command.
[3076.70 --> 3080.74]  Lord's Day 38, question and answer 103, describes the Sabbath, saying the following.
[3080.80 --> 3081.98]  I'll just read the question and answer here.
[3082.02 --> 3084.78]  It says, what is God's will for you in the fourth commandment?
[3084.88 --> 3088.20]  The fourth commandment being that we should remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.
[3088.76 --> 3093.44]  The answer, first, that the gospel ministry and education for Sabbath be maintained,
[3093.44 --> 3097.98]  and that especially on the festive day of rest, store that away for later, please,
[3098.40 --> 3105.30]  I diligently attend the assembly of God's people to learn what God's word teaches,
[3105.42 --> 3107.88]  to participate in the sacraments, to pray for God publicly,
[3107.88 --> 3112.22]  and to bring Christian offerings for the poor, for others.
[3113.58 --> 3115.38]  Attend the assembly of God's people.
[3116.68 --> 3117.70]  Think about others.
[3119.84 --> 3121.30]  Give to others.
[3121.30 --> 3126.70]  Not hang out by yourself, but join God's people and learn the word of God together.
[3126.82 --> 3128.84]  Take part in the sacraments together.
[3129.02 --> 3130.02]  Pray together.
[3130.16 --> 3130.82]  Be together.
[3130.98 --> 3132.00]  Give together.
[3132.24 --> 3133.62]  Serve together.
[3133.86 --> 3137.56]  Sabbath is meant for the community to get together and combat the self,
[3138.20 --> 3139.70]  which our culture is obsessed with,
[3140.70 --> 3142.46]  and be present for the other.
[3144.36 --> 3147.66]  Now, we're going to connect the importance of Sabbath being communal
[3147.66 --> 3150.74]  with the obstacles of legalism and busyness for a minute.
[3150.74 --> 3154.62]  The director of faith formations ministry, Chris Schoen, he points this out beautifully.
[3155.00 --> 3155.82]  So he highlights this.
[3155.88 --> 3156.08]  He says,
[3156.18 --> 3161.94]  In the Old Testament, God's people, they get ridiculed by the prophets for not observing the Sabbath.
[3162.22 --> 3167.34]  So in Isaiah 1, for example, God declares how Israel's worship became meaningless
[3167.34 --> 3172.70]  because instead, they were oppressing the people.
[3173.12 --> 3177.34]  So instead, they needed to defend the oppressed and attend to the fatherless and the widow.
[3177.34 --> 3181.82]  In Ezekiel 22, God talks about how his people are shedding blood.
[3182.24 --> 3183.32]  They're neglecting their children.
[3183.46 --> 3184.72]  They're oppressing immigrants.
[3185.02 --> 3189.16]  They're mistreating orphans and widows as they desecrate the Sabbath.
[3190.32 --> 3195.84]  And then in Amos 8, God condemns Israel for impatiently longing for the Sabbath to finish.
[3196.54 --> 3197.30]  This is horrifying.
[3197.56 --> 3202.32]  So that they can go back to their dishonest scales and selling the poor people in the market.
[3202.32 --> 3207.80]  Now in these examples, God is rejecting Israel's Sabbath practices
[3207.80 --> 3212.66]  because they are disconnected from how they treat the vulnerable people in their community.
[3213.90 --> 3217.16]  Their Sabbath and the way they treat their community, they don't align.
[3217.24 --> 3221.44]  They were too busy living lives the way they wanted to live their lives,
[3221.52 --> 3223.44]  the way they had always been living their lives,
[3223.60 --> 3225.28]  and they weren't living for others.
[3225.34 --> 3226.74]  In fact, they were abusing others.
[3226.74 --> 3231.38]  And that ran very opposed to how God wants people to act on the Sabbath.
[3232.00 --> 3233.38]  Then we get to the New Testament,
[3233.92 --> 3237.68]  and Jesus gets ridiculed by the Pharisees a lot on the Sabbath.
[3238.02 --> 3241.52]  In Matthew 12, Jesus heals a man with a shriveled hand on the Sabbath.
[3241.64 --> 3244.48]  Luke 13, he heals a crippled woman on the Sabbath.
[3244.58 --> 3248.06]  Luke 14, he heals a man with abdominal swelling on the Sabbath.
[3248.30 --> 3251.30]  And in John 5, Jesus heals a lame man on the Sabbath.
[3251.38 --> 3251.78]  That's four.
[3251.86 --> 3252.44]  There's lots more.
[3252.44 --> 3257.54]  But every single time he does a miracle on the Sabbath, the Pharisees get very upset.
[3258.52 --> 3260.58]  He was breaking the rules, Jesus was.
[3261.40 --> 3263.92]  He wasn't resting in the Pharisees' eyes.
[3265.22 --> 3269.46]  So in the Old Testament, the Israelites were too busy to remember the Sabbath in the Old Testament,
[3269.58 --> 3273.58]  and they treated the least of these very poorly.
[3274.36 --> 3278.76]  And in the New Testament, Jesus starts treating the least of these with his healing power,
[3278.76 --> 3282.92]  and he gets ridiculed because he's not following the rules.
[3285.04 --> 3287.24]  Busyness and legalism, forgetting about the others.
[3289.52 --> 3291.52]  But Sabbath is for all of us to remember,
[3291.60 --> 3294.76]  to remember and to observe so that we can gather, which we do,
[3295.16 --> 3296.94]  so that we can grow, which we do,
[3297.72 --> 3302.64]  and then so we can go into our communities and be the hands and feet of Jesus.
[3302.64 --> 3303.86]  We're not individuals.
[3304.00 --> 3304.66]  We're community.
[3305.16 --> 3308.94]  And when we observe Sabbath, we're to be there for the people around us.
[3309.00 --> 3311.42]  In our church, yes, but beyond the walls, too.
[3313.86 --> 3316.74]  Sabbath is not for you, singular, but for you, church.
[3317.56 --> 3321.30]  And all who believe to show God's love to the world that we live in.
[3321.94 --> 3323.54]  There's a gather part to our Sabbath.
[3323.62 --> 3324.42]  I think we get that.
[3324.52 --> 3325.90]  There's a grow part to our Sabbath.
[3325.98 --> 3326.82]  I think we get that.
[3327.12 --> 3328.76]  But there's a go part as well.
[3330.44 --> 3331.18]  Do we do that?
[3331.18 --> 3333.22]  That's something to ponder today.
[3334.40 --> 3337.70]  So we've talked about what Sabbath is and who Sabbath is for.
[3339.00 --> 3340.42]  But when is Sabbath?
[3341.28 --> 3342.74]  Now, some of you are probably thinking,
[3342.86 --> 3344.48]  well, you saved the easiest one for last.
[3345.20 --> 3346.54]  And I mean, verse 15 of our text says,
[3346.64 --> 3348.04]  for six days work is to be done,
[3348.08 --> 3350.82]  but on the seventh day is a day of Sabbath rest, holy to the Lord.
[3351.24 --> 3352.52]  Therefore, Sabbath is Sunday, right?
[3353.52 --> 3353.82]  Done.
[3355.56 --> 3356.34]  Or is it?
[3357.54 --> 3357.90]  Right?
[3357.90 --> 3358.60]  Because Jesus.
[3358.60 --> 3363.06]  Jesus comes and changes everything.
[3363.88 --> 3365.14]  He changes everything.
[3366.22 --> 3369.66]  See, when Jesus came, he took all of these commandments, all ten of them,
[3369.78 --> 3370.76]  and he blew them up.
[3371.36 --> 3372.12]  He just blew them up.
[3372.40 --> 3373.46]  He didn't get rid of them.
[3374.16 --> 3374.82]  Don't hear me wrong.
[3374.86 --> 3375.58]  He didn't get rid of them.
[3375.64 --> 3377.02]  They're still very applicable.
[3377.02 --> 3379.70]  In fact, he fulfilled them all.
[3380.44 --> 3381.98]  He was very concerned with them.
[3382.84 --> 3384.06]  But he did blow them up.
[3384.92 --> 3387.18]  So for an example, do not make an idol in the image of God.
[3387.40 --> 3388.20]  Jesus isn't talking.
[3388.46 --> 3389.08]  He came along and said,
[3389.14 --> 3390.62]  I'm not talking about crafting one out of wood.
[3391.42 --> 3394.84]  But anything that becomes an ultimate thing becomes an idol in your life.
[3395.44 --> 3396.08]  Do not murder.
[3396.08 --> 3403.18]  Jesus says, anyone who hates someone or is angry with someone and doesn't want to resolve that conflict commits murder.
[3404.30 --> 3405.18]  Do you not commit adultery?
[3405.52 --> 3409.34]  Jesus says, if you look at someone lustfully, you have committed adultery in your heart.
[3410.78 --> 3414.66]  Honestly, Jesus comes and redefines the boundaries of all of these commandments.
[3414.66 --> 3416.66]  And Sabbath is no different.
[3417.94 --> 3421.74]  Just like last week when Pastor Chris talked about how the tabernacle and the temple,
[3422.38 --> 3426.60]  how they are no longer physical places, but they are now a body of believers.
[3427.28 --> 3430.52]  Sabbath is now no longer a single holy day in a week.
[3431.12 --> 3436.42]  But it's an eternal realization of the eternal rest we find in Jesus Christ.
[3437.16 --> 3442.16]  In Jesus, Sabbath is no longer a holy day, but a holy eternity.
[3442.16 --> 3445.08]  And it's not one that starts when we die.
[3445.68 --> 3451.62]  But this holy Sabbath eternity starts once we believe in the gospel truth of Jesus Christ.
[3452.12 --> 3456.02]  So let's just slow down for a second and look a little deeper at this.
[3456.60 --> 3459.40]  There's a little bit more to that Heidelberg Catechism answer.
[3459.74 --> 3463.42]  The second part of question and answer 103, it continues, and it says this.
[3464.28 --> 3468.10]  It says that every day of my life, I rest from my evil ways.
[3469.48 --> 3471.48]  This is how we are to respond to this commandment.
[3471.48 --> 3473.74]  That every day of my life, I rest from my evil ways.
[3474.30 --> 3476.62]  I let the Lord work in me through His Spirit.
[3477.20 --> 3481.66]  And then so begin in this life the eternal Sabbath.
[3483.44 --> 3486.80]  So I begin in this life the eternal Sabbath.
[3488.52 --> 3491.52]  Now the Catechism here is referring to Hebrews 4.
[3492.00 --> 3494.78]  And so I challenge you all, I encourage you all, actually I should say,
[3494.86 --> 3496.96]  go home today, this week, read Hebrews 4.
[3496.96 --> 3499.14]  If this is kind of mucking with your head, give that a read.
[3499.82 --> 3502.52]  Because there we learn that Jesus came and offered rest.
[3502.90 --> 3505.96]  Not just rest for a day, but rest for an eternity.
[3506.58 --> 3512.50]  And not rest that we're to experience once a week, but rest that we can enter into daily.
[3513.22 --> 3514.92]  Not when we die, but when we believe.
[3514.92 --> 3517.50]  That's when Sabbath is.
[3518.28 --> 3521.18]  That is when Sabbath is.
[3521.50 --> 3522.04]  It's always.
[3523.18 --> 3526.98]  It's on Sunday when you're at church here, and it's on Wednesday when you're at work.
[3527.14 --> 3530.24]  It's when you're teaching, or when you're building, or when you're reading.
[3530.34 --> 3535.44]  It's when you're working, or playing, when you're tired, when you're overwhelmed, or when you're bored.
[3535.44 --> 3540.38]  While we gather here as his people on Sunday, Sabbath is for always.
[3541.28 --> 3545.64]  And while we might treat Sunday with special reverence where we don't work,
[3546.22 --> 3549.72]  that Sabbath day, that Sunday that we treat that way is a microcosm
[3549.72 --> 3553.04]  for how our whole new lives in Jesus Christ should look.
[3553.88 --> 3556.24]  These new lives of eternal rest.
[3556.24 --> 3561.34]  And while we may practice a festive day of rest once a week,
[3561.38 --> 3562.50]  remember that from that answer?
[3562.96 --> 3565.80]  While we may practice a festive day of rest once a week,
[3566.64 --> 3568.12]  God's Sabbath is for every day.
[3570.56 --> 3573.98]  Jesus came and he gave us eternal rest in him.
[3574.06 --> 3575.90]  He was born into this world,
[3575.90 --> 3579.46]  and he lived this perfect life that we have all been called to live.
[3579.76 --> 3582.06]  And then, and then he took our sinfulness,
[3582.70 --> 3584.08]  and he took our burdens,
[3584.08 --> 3586.46]  and he took everything that makes us weary,
[3586.46 --> 3588.22]  and he took it with him,
[3588.22 --> 3589.24]  and he put it on his shoulders,
[3589.24 --> 3590.42]  and he went to the cross,
[3590.42 --> 3592.30]  and he died with it,
[3592.44 --> 3593.90]  taking all of that to the grave.
[3594.80 --> 3596.52]  And then three days later, he rose again,
[3596.58 --> 3598.30]  and he defeated not just sin,
[3598.72 --> 3599.74]  and not just death,
[3600.02 --> 3602.74]  but the weight of burdens we experience each and every day.
[3602.82 --> 3604.84]  Now, please hear this.
[3606.04 --> 3608.26]  If you hear one thing today, please hear this.
[3609.08 --> 3611.76]  Just because Jesus lived the life we should have lived,
[3611.84 --> 3613.70]  and died the death we deserve to die,
[3613.70 --> 3617.92]  and he rose again victorious from the grave over sin and death and the burdens of the world,
[3617.92 --> 3622.28]  just because he defeated all those things that exhaust us once and for all,
[3623.24 --> 3626.92]  that does not mean that we will not sin in this world.
[3627.92 --> 3631.74]  That does not mean that we will not die an earthly death in this world.
[3632.42 --> 3637.24]  It also does not mean that we won't be burdened or weary or tired in this world.
[3637.24 --> 3639.72]  But what it does mean,
[3639.72 --> 3641.70]  the glorious truth of that,
[3641.96 --> 3643.82]  is that even though we sin,
[3644.20 --> 3648.02]  unlimited forgiveness and grace is available because of Jesus Christ.
[3648.52 --> 3649.94]  And even though we will die,
[3650.28 --> 3653.94]  eternal life is available for all people who believe in Jesus.
[3654.96 --> 3657.28]  And even though we will get tired and weary,
[3657.70 --> 3661.84]  eternal Sabbath rest is given to you by Jesus our Lord
[3661.84 --> 3665.84]  when you remember and observe what he has done for you.
[3666.64 --> 3670.62]  We find our eternal Sabbath rest in him now,
[3670.70 --> 3671.72]  no later when we die,
[3671.86 --> 3672.60]  right now,
[3672.72 --> 3673.74]  not only on Sundays,
[3674.04 --> 3674.88]  but right now,
[3675.12 --> 3675.80]  next week,
[3676.36 --> 3676.82]  Tuesday,
[3677.20 --> 3677.62]  Thursday,
[3677.76 --> 3679.78]  we find our rest in him.
[3680.06 --> 3684.26]  And so what does it mean to find our rest in him?
[3685.18 --> 3686.12]  We'll conclude with this.
[3687.64 --> 3688.04]  Well,
[3688.08 --> 3688.24]  first,
[3688.30 --> 3689.22]  like we've been talking about,
[3689.70 --> 3693.30]  we can't be too busy to miss what Jesus has done for us.
[3694.50 --> 3695.88]  Sometimes I think we as Christians,
[3696.04 --> 3699.44]  we gloss over this gospel truth that is so powerful in our lives
[3699.44 --> 3700.68]  because we've heard it so many times.
[3701.00 --> 3703.56]  Don't let the busyness of life let us forget this.
[3704.54 --> 3705.94]  He's forgiven our sins.
[3706.06 --> 3707.34]  He's given us eternal life.
[3707.44 --> 3710.32]  He's provided us with eternal rest.
[3710.32 --> 3715.04]  If we're too busy and we don't stop to remember and observe,
[3715.12 --> 3716.38]  if we don't slow down,
[3717.30 --> 3719.76]  we'll miss what he's done for us.
[3719.82 --> 3720.84]  We'll miss this truth.
[3722.92 --> 3724.02]  On the flip of that,
[3724.86 --> 3726.54]  it's also not a matter of making lists,
[3727.02 --> 3728.82]  a to-do list or a not to-do list.
[3729.86 --> 3731.78]  Making a list of things we can't do
[3731.78 --> 3733.08]  because we're trying to gain rest
[3733.08 --> 3734.64]  becomes legalistic un-dizzyness.
[3735.12 --> 3736.98]  We don't need a new legalism in our life.
[3738.12 --> 3740.16]  We definitely don't need a new legalism in our worship.
[3740.32 --> 3743.64]  What we need is a new posture.
[3745.18 --> 3746.96]  Our understanding of Sabbath
[3746.96 --> 3748.40]  needs to start by understanding
[3748.40 --> 3750.48]  that we can give our burdens to Jesus.
[3750.62 --> 3751.84]  In fact, he's taken them already.
[3753.24 --> 3755.90]  While we still take a day once a week to come to church,
[3756.00 --> 3757.00]  to stop our working,
[3757.10 --> 3758.90]  to slow down our pace,
[3759.16 --> 3759.96]  that's good.
[3761.00 --> 3762.80]  But it's not because of some rule
[3762.80 --> 3764.64]  that we need to find rest on that day
[3764.64 --> 3766.00]  and only that day a week.
[3766.30 --> 3767.74]  We slow down on Sundays
[3767.74 --> 3769.12]  or maybe Saturdays or Mondays
[3769.12 --> 3770.08]  or whatever Sabbath is.
[3770.32 --> 3772.64]  But we slow down in order to understand
[3772.64 --> 3775.18]  that rest is not something we get
[3775.18 --> 3776.40]  because we stopped working.
[3777.64 --> 3779.84]  Rest is something we've already gained
[3779.84 --> 3781.94]  because of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.
[3781.94 --> 3788.32]  We find our rest in Jesus once we wrap our head
[3788.32 --> 3790.56]  around the fact that believing in Jesus
[3790.56 --> 3792.02]  is not a once-a-week thing.
[3793.14 --> 3794.90]  We find our rest in Jesus
[3794.90 --> 3797.88]  once we see that Jesus changed everything.
[3799.94 --> 3801.34]  He changed it always.
[3801.34 --> 3805.24]  And that we aren't here to run that rat race of life,
[3805.24 --> 3806.96]  but we're here to live in this world
[3806.96 --> 3809.36]  as ambassadors for God's kingdom,
[3809.36 --> 3811.20]  both now and when he comes again.
[3813.24 --> 3816.84]  Don't stop working on Sundays to gain rest.
[3817.28 --> 3818.94]  We've already received rest.
[3819.20 --> 3821.34]  We've already gained eternal Sabbath.
[3821.34 --> 3823.92]  So we can stop working so hard
[3823.92 --> 3825.32]  for the frivolous things of this world.
[3825.56 --> 3828.04]  Again, we don't stop to gain.
[3828.20 --> 3829.56]  We've already gained.
[3830.08 --> 3834.70]  So stop and remember and observe.
[3834.70 --> 3838.60]  The temple moved from a place to a people,
[3838.72 --> 3840.00]  and so now, like we said last week,
[3840.04 --> 3841.24]  we gather and we scatter.
[3842.42 --> 3844.46]  Sabbath has moved from a day to an eternity.
[3845.36 --> 3847.36]  Now we gather on Sabbath to remember
[3847.36 --> 3850.84]  and observe our Sabbath rest in him
[3850.84 --> 3852.64]  so that when we scatter,
[3853.16 --> 3856.12]  we can remember and observe our Sabbath rest
[3856.12 --> 3858.40]  in the week, always, not just Sunday.
[3862.00 --> 3863.56]  We find that rest in Jesus
[3863.56 --> 3864.84]  any day of the week.
[3864.86 --> 3866.12]  And whenever we slow down enough
[3866.12 --> 3868.08]  to see what God has given us,
[3868.88 --> 3870.00]  taking a day, a week,
[3870.08 --> 3871.94]  to stop working and gather as his people,
[3872.32 --> 3873.24]  hear his word together,
[3873.24 --> 3875.04]  and eat, drink, and be together is good.
[3875.18 --> 3876.18]  That's a good discipline.
[3876.56 --> 3879.50]  But remembering that the Sabbath is eternal
[3879.50 --> 3882.78]  is what will help us find ultimate rest in him
[3882.78 --> 3883.84]  any day of the week.
[3886.52 --> 3888.54]  Remembering and observing our rest in Jesus Christ
[3888.54 --> 3889.86]  is up to each of us to do,
[3889.96 --> 3891.22]  as a community for sure,
[3891.30 --> 3892.74]  also separately, individually.
[3893.56 --> 3896.02]  And so will you find your rest in Jesus today?
[3897.60 --> 3899.38]  Will you find that rest again tomorrow
[3899.38 --> 3900.84]  when you're working
[3900.84 --> 3902.84]  or the next day after that?
[3904.12 --> 3905.72]  He's granted you eternal rest.
[3906.72 --> 3908.72]  So let's not run this rat race of life
[3908.72 --> 3911.30]  or make this unofficial rule book we've created
[3911.30 --> 3913.42]  cause us to miss that.
[3913.80 --> 3914.04]  Amen?
[3914.04 --> 3914.14]  Amen?
[3914.98 --> 3915.72]  Let me pray.
[3915.72 --> 3922.14]  Father in heaven,
[3922.14 --> 3925.84]  Jesus Christ our Lord,
[3925.96 --> 3927.64]  you changed everything.
[3928.96 --> 3929.44]  Everything.
[3931.20 --> 3933.24]  And God, you call us to rest.
[3934.04 --> 3936.14]  You emphatically call us to rest.
[3936.72 --> 3938.30]  You call us to remember the Sabbath,
[3938.44 --> 3939.40]  to observe the Sabbath,
[3939.40 --> 3940.90]  because by doing that,
[3941.32 --> 3942.70]  we can know that you are God
[3942.70 --> 3943.56]  and you make us holy.
[3944.80 --> 3946.74]  Lord, let us not pigeonhole this.
[3947.76 --> 3948.52]  Let us understand
[3948.52 --> 3949.74]  that you sent your Son
[3949.74 --> 3951.92]  to live, to die,
[3951.98 --> 3952.84]  and to rise again
[3952.84 --> 3954.02]  so that we may receive
[3954.02 --> 3955.26]  eternal rest always.
[3956.40 --> 3957.80]  And God, we will still be weary,
[3957.92 --> 3958.92]  we will still be burdened,
[3958.96 --> 3959.88]  but you are God
[3959.88 --> 3961.06]  and we can come to you.
[3961.24 --> 3962.44]  When we are feeling that way,
[3962.50 --> 3963.48]  let us slow down.
[3963.48 --> 3967.44]  Let us come to you.
[3968.60 --> 3970.20]  Actually come to you.
[3973.12 --> 3974.58]  And God, we just pray that you,
[3974.70 --> 3975.20]  as you promised,
[3975.30 --> 3976.54]  will take our burdens from us.
[3976.72 --> 3978.58]  May we remember who you are.
[3979.28 --> 3981.40]  May we observe what you have done for us,
[3981.54 --> 3982.38]  not just today,
[3982.76 --> 3984.72]  but tomorrow and the next day.
[3985.36 --> 3986.64]  And God, may that become
[3986.64 --> 3988.28]  a regular rhythm in our life.
[3989.06 --> 3990.94]  Allow your rest to penetrate our lives,
[3991.02 --> 3991.34]  we pray,
[3991.42 --> 3993.34]  in your Son's precious and holy name.
[3993.60 --> 3993.80]  Amen.
[4019.80 --> 4023.42]  Thank you for saving
[4023.42 --> 4028.42]  What can I say?
[4028.42 --> 4035.88]  You are my everything.
[4035.88 --> 4041.80]  I will sing your praise.
[4041.80 --> 4047.80]  You shed your blood for me.
[4047.80 --> 4052.80]  What can I say?
[4052.80 --> 4059.80]  You took my sin and shame.
[4059.80 --> 4066.26]  A sinner called my name.
[4066.26 --> 4078.26]  Great is the Lord.
[4078.26 --> 4081.26]  Great is the Lord.
[4081.26 --> 4088.26]  Great is the Lord.
[4088.26 --> 4089.26]  God, God.
[4089.26 --> 4090.26]  You have set your heart.
[4090.26 --> 4093.26]  For we know your truth
[4093.26 --> 4100.26]  earth has set us free.
[4100.26 --> 4102.34]  You've set your heart.
[4102.34 --> 4106.26]  You set your heart.
[4106.26 --> 4109.26]  You set your heart in me.
[4109.26 --> 4111.26]  in me.
[4116.20 --> 4119.20]  Mercy and
[4119.20 --> 4122.26]  grace are mine.
[4122.72 --> 4125.50]  Forgiven is my
[4125.50 --> 4127.26]  sin.
[4128.84 --> 4131.10]  Jesus, my
[4131.10 --> 4133.26]  only hope,
[4134.72 --> 4137.40]  Savior of the
[4137.40 --> 4139.16]  world.
[4140.56 --> 4141.30]  Great
[4141.30 --> 4143.86]  is the Lord
[4143.86 --> 4145.68]  we cry.
[4145.68 --> 4147.14]  Let your
[4147.14 --> 4149.68]  kingdom come.
[4151.96 --> 4153.64]  Your word
[4153.64 --> 4156.02]  has let me
[4156.02 --> 4157.28]  sing.
[4157.64 --> 4158.72]  Thank you for
[4158.72 --> 4161.68]  saving me.
[4161.68 --> 4166.64]  Great
[4166.64 --> 4169.06]  is
[4170.66 --> 4171.76]  the
[4171.76 --> 4173.72]  Lord.
[4176.72 --> 4178.58]  Great
[4178.58 --> 4180.00]  is
[4180.00 --> 4181.64]  the
[4181.64 --> 4183.80]  Lord.

[4185.02 --> 4185.64]  for both

[4197.98 --> 4207.98]  You set your hope in me.
[4215.64 --> 4225.28]  Just a reminder that after the service today we'll have coffee in the foyer and if any kids are in the kids choir for I believe it's Easter, there is a practice.
[4225.60 --> 4230.06]  So after the service today if you're a kid or you have a kid, I guess they're probably all out there, they're not here.
[4230.54 --> 4232.76]  But parents send your kids there, that's where they're supposed to be.

[4242.52 --> 4244.80]  So this parting blessing in number six.
[4245.64 --> 4247.72]  The Lord bless you and keep you.
[4248.28 --> 4252.22]  The Lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[4252.86 --> 4256.74]  The Lord turn his face toward you and give you peace.
[4257.50 --> 4258.54]  Dios te bendiga.
[4259.68 --> 4260.08]  Amen.
[4265.20 --> 4271.28]  As we sing our parting song of worship this morning, we end with these words from Joshua 24.
[4272.12 --> 4275.14]  Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve.
[4275.64 --> 4279.16]  But for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.
