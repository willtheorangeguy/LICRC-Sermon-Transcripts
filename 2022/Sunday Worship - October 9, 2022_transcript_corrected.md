[579.92 → 586.42] Good morning.
[588.42 → 596.04] Welcome to worship on this beautiful, sunny, long weekend Sunday.
[596.76 → 602.62] Special welcome if you are here visiting with us this morning, either here in person or online.
[602.62 → 608.40] We are going to let that settle itself.
[609.00 → 609.82] Very good.
[610.10 → 612.92] We are glad that you are here with us this morning.
[613.64 → 617.64] As you can see later in our worship service, we're going to be participating in the Lord's Supper.
[618.12 → 624.08] And so we encourage you here or at home to join us in that time together.
[624.94 → 629.80] Also, especially if you're visiting with us this morning, but we have these cards available.
[629.80 → 632.70] They're on the back table and variously around the church.
[632.80 → 638.34] You'll find these QR codes that you can scan and that will give you the opportunity to connect with us.
[638.34 → 641.80] And we can connect with you and maybe meet with you or pray for you.
[641.92 → 646.06] Find out how we can serve you in some way together.
[646.18 → 649.34] And so please, if you would like to, take the opportunity to do that.
[650.02 → 656.98] As well, I want to just mention quickly that tomorrow, on Thanksgiving Monday, we are having a worship service here.
[656.98 → 658.48] It begins at 10 a.m.
[658.48 → 662.32] And so everyone is invited to come to that service.
[662.32 → 663.04] We'll gather.
[663.20 → 667.20] We'll give thanks to our God and worship his name together.
[668.58 → 675.88] As we gather in the presence of God, we do so as those whom are called and as those whom are welcomed by God.
[675.88 → 678.20] And so I'm going to invite you, as you're able, to stand.
[679.06 → 681.24] We can receive together God's greeting.
[686.94 → 689.06] Before I do that, there's one more announcement.
[689.80 → 690.86] This is me looking at my list.
[691.00 → 691.88] Nikki, don't get mad at me.
[691.94 → 692.32] I remembered.
[693.68 → 700.30] The GEMS are doing their GEMS Camp fundraiser again this year.
[700.30 → 705.96] And so, if you don't know, GEMS is a girls' ministry here among us.
[706.06 → 713.56] And they get together every other Thursday, do crafts and Bible study, and grow together in faith and in community.
[714.46 → 718.30] And they, every year, do...
[718.82 → 721.46] What's the actual name of the fundraiser?
[721.58 → 721.76] Anyone?
[722.98 → 723.94] Cookie Jars.
[724.08 → 725.06] There, Jar Fundraiser.
[725.16 → 726.96] That seems like it needs a better name, Courtney.
[726.96 → 734.46] But we're looking for Mason jars to help facilitate this.
[734.54 → 736.68] We need something like 400, maybe more.
[736.78 → 738.22] Depends on how generous you want to be.
[738.84 → 740.92] And they need to be a particular Mason jar.
[741.34 → 745.72] So they need the quart-sized jar with a wide mouth.
[747.00 → 748.28] Apparently that means something.
[749.30 → 750.34] I don't know.
[751.06 → 752.36] But that's what they need.
[752.36 → 758.26] I was told that you can get them from the thrift store or wherever you happen to find them.
[758.42 → 761.98] What matters is that they are quart-sized with a wide mouth.
[762.74 → 766.96] If you have any questions about that, you can talk to Nikki or Rachel.
[767.24 → 768.52] Nikki, Rachel, wave your hands.
[768.70 → 769.46] Oh, they're both over here.
[769.54 → 769.82] Perfect.
[770.30 → 770.88] Talk to them.
[770.96 → 773.10] They're figuring that out for the GEMS this year.
[773.10 → 780.58] If you do bring some to give to us and to donate, you can leave them in Pastor Kevin's office.
[781.80 → 783.64] I was told that's also the case.
[786.22 → 786.80] All right.
[786.86 → 788.76] I think that's it.
[790.06 → 790.50] Perfect.
[791.50 → 795.76] We gather together in the presence of our God and so receive his greeting.
[797.14 → 801.26] Grace, mercy, and peace to you.
[801.26 → 807.56] From God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[808.64 → 809.02] Amen.
[809.90 → 816.40] As God has greeted us, I invite you to turn to each other and greet those with whom we are worshipping this morning.
[822.40 → 823.48] Hello, everybody.
[829.42 → 830.18] Hello, Kevin.
[831.26 → 831.98] Good morning.
[833.64 → 834.56] Mark, morning.
[835.18 → 835.56] Again.
[836.16 → 836.74] It's been a while.
[847.24 → 853.12] Behold, the eye of the Lord is on those who fear him, on those whose hope in his steadfast love,
[853.54 → 857.12] that he may deliver their soul from death and keep them alive in famine.
[857.12 → 859.30] Let all the earth fear the Lord.
[859.30 → 862.44] Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.
[862.44 → 864.28] Good morning.
[864.28 → 864.44] Okay.
[865.36 → 866.20] If a great guest now has asked for you, the man Of the spiritual I am by His pulpit ins.
[866.20 → 881.22] You are beautiful beyond description
[881.22 → 889.30] Too marvellous for words
[889.30 → 894.62] Too wonderful for comprehension
[894.62 → 901.62] Like nothing ever seen or heard
[902.30 → 907.74] Who can grasp your infinite wisdom
[907.74 → 914.70] Who can problem the depths of your love
[914.70 → 920.62] You are beautiful beyond description
[920.62 → 927.62] Majesty and throne of all
[927.62 → 935.62] And I stand, I stand in awe of you
[935.62 → 942.62] I stand, I stand in awe of you
[942.62 → 949.62] Holy God to whom all praise is due
[949.62 → 954.62] I stand in awe of you
[954.62 → 963.62] You are beautiful beyond description
[963.62 → 970.62] Till God hurts you in for my sin
[970.62 → 977.62] In agony and deep affliction
[977.62 → 984.62] Cut off that I might enter in
[984.62 → 991.62] Who can grasp such tender compassion
[991.62 → 997.62] Who can fathom this mercy so free
[997.62 → 1003.62] You are beautiful beyond description
[1003.62 → 1010.62] I stand, I stand in awe of you
[1010.62 → 1014.62] I stand, I stand in awe of you
[1014.62 → 1021.62] I stand, I stand in awe of you
[1021.62 → 1025.62] I stand, I stand in awe of you
[1025.62 → 1032.62] Holy God to whom all praise is due
[1032.62 → 1039.62] I stand in awe of you
[1039.62 → 1046.62] I stand, I stand in awe of you
[1046.62 → 1049.62] I stand, I stand in awe of you
[1049.62 → 1067.08] I wish so by now that you would have reached down
[1067.08 → 1070.70] And wiped away your tears away
[1070.70 → 1074.40] Stepped in and saved the day
[1074.40 → 1080.22] But once again I'll say Amen
[1080.22 → 1083.76] And it's still raining
[1083.76 → 1089.50] As the thunder rolls
[1089.50 → 1094.94] I dare to hear you whisper through the rain
[1094.94 → 1098.30] I'm with you
[1098.30 → 1103.28] And as your mercy falls
[1103.28 → 1108.90] I'll raise my hands and praise the God who gives
[1108.90 → 1111.10] And takes away
[1111.10 → 1117.94] I'll praise you with this storm
[1117.94 → 1121.94] And I will lift my hands
[1121.94 → 1125.28] For you are who you are
[1125.28 → 1128.64] No matter where I am
[1128.64 → 1131.26] And every tear I cry
[1131.26 → 1134.26] You hold in your hand
[1134.26 → 1138.70] You've never left my time
[1138.70 → 1141.80] Though my heart is torn
[1141.80 → 1148.42] I will praise you in this storm
[1148.42 → 1161.42] I remember when I stumbled in the wind
[1161.42 → 1163.42] You heard my cry
[1163.42 → 1165.04] I will praise you
[1165.04 → 1167.04] And raise me up again
[1167.04 → 1171.08] But my strength is almost gone
[1171.08 → 1174.36] How can I carry on
[1174.36 → 1178.04] If I can't find you
[1178.04 → 1180.66] And as the thunder rolls
[1180.66 → 1182.46] And as the thunder rolls
[1182.46 → 1187.98] I barely hear you whisper through the rain
[1187.98 → 1190.86] I'm with you
[1190.86 → 1194.66] And as your mercy falls
[1194.66 → 1199.86] I'll raise my hands and praise the God who gives
[1199.86 → 1201.48] And change the wind
[1201.48 → 1203.48] And change the wind
[1203.48 → 1209.48] And I'll praise you with this storm
[1209.48 → 1212.48] And I will lift my hands
[1212.48 → 1216.48] And you are who you are
[1216.48 → 1220.10] No matter where I am
[1220.10 → 1223.10] And every tear I cry
[1223.10 → 1227.10] You hold in your hand
[1227.10 → 1230.10] You've never left my side
[1230.10 → 1233.10] And all my heart is torn
[1233.10 → 1240.00] I will praise you in this storm
[1240.00 → 1249.34] I lift my eyes until it is
[1249.34 → 1252.66] Where does my health come from?
[1252.66 → 1255.54] My health comes from the Lord
[1255.54 → 1258.88] The maker of heaven and earth
[1258.88 → 1262.52] I lift my eyes until it is
[1262.52 → 1265.78] Where does my health come from?
[1266.00 → 1268.62] My health comes from the Lord
[1268.62 → 1272.78] The maker of heaven and earth
[1272.78 → 1289.74] And I'll praise you with this storm
[1289.74 → 1293.00] And I will lift my hands
[1293.00 → 1296.24] For you are who you are
[1296.24 → 1299.54] No matter where I am
[1299.54 → 1302.40] And every tear I cry
[1302.40 → 1305.94] You hold in your hand
[1305.94 → 1309.20] You've never left my side
[1309.20 → 1312.24] And though my heart is torn
[1312.24 → 1319.24] I will praise you in this storm
[1319.24 → 1325.40] And though my heart is torn
[1325.40 → 1331.54] I will praise you in this storm
[1331.54 → 1344.64] I remember my affliction and my wanderings
[1344.64 → 1346.04] The bitterness and the gall
[1346.04 → 1347.88] I well remember them
[1347.88 → 1350.74] And my soul is downcast within me
[1350.74 → 1353.30] Yet this I will call to mind
[1353.30 → 1354.62] And therefore I have hope
[1354.62 → 1356.78] Because of the Lord's great love
[1356.78 → 1358.00] We are not consumed
[1358.00 → 1360.32] For his compassions never fail
[1360.32 → 1362.20] They are new every morning
[1362.20 → 1364.06] Great is your faithfulness
[1364.06 → 1365.60] I say to myself
[1365.60 → 1367.00] The Lord is my portion
[1367.00 → 1369.20] Therefore I will wait for him
[1369.20 → 1370.88] Forgive us Lord
[1370.88 → 1373.82] Then when we forget your steadfast love
[1373.82 → 1377.46] When our affliction is too great in our mind
[1377.46 → 1379.26] When our struggle and doubt
[1379.26 → 1381.08] When we struggle and doubt
[1381.08 → 1382.08] Alone in the dark
[1382.08 → 1383.62] As we allow ourselves
[1383.62 → 1384.98] To wander from you
[1384.98 → 1387.30] Wondering if we'll wander back to you
[1387.30 → 1388.46] Or be lost in darkness
[1388.46 → 1389.96] Teach us again
[1389.96 → 1391.36] To wait on you
[1391.36 → 1394.00] For the Lord is good to those
[1394.00 → 1395.08] Whose hope is in him
[1395.08 → 1396.66] To the one who seeks him
[1396.66 → 1398.48] It is good to wait quietly
[1398.48 → 1400.32] For the salvation of the Lord
[1400.32 → 1403.74] Father
[1403.74 → 1433.72] Thank you.
[1433.74 → 1443.34] Out of the depths I cry to you, in the darkest places I will call.
[1444.40 → 1455.00] Incline your ear to me anew, and hear my cry for mercy, Lord.
[1455.00 → 1466.10] For you to count my sinful ways, how could I come before your throne?
[1466.80 → 1471.00] Yet full forgiveness meets my gaze.
[1471.00 → 1476.80] I stand redeemed by grace alone.
[1478.02 → 1483.48] I will wait for you, I will wait for you.
[1483.80 → 1487.78] On your word I will rely on.
[1487.78 → 1499.78] I will wait for you, surely wait for you, till my soul is satisfied.
[1499.78 → 1513.78] So put your hope in God alone.
[1513.78 → 1524.84] Take courage in his power to say, completely and forever won.
[1525.38 → 1529.78] By Christ's rematching crown of grace.
[1529.78 → 1535.84] I will wait for you, I will wait for you.
[1536.02 → 1539.98] On your word I will rely on.
[1541.34 → 1550.60] I will wait for you, surely wait for you, till my soul is satisfied.
[1550.60 → 1565.34] His steadfast love has made a way.
[1565.34 → 1570.74] And God himself has paid the price.
[1571.40 → 1579.98] That all who trust in him today, find healing in his sacrifice.
[1579.98 → 1586.60] I will wait for you, I will wait for you.
[1586.60 → 1591.66] Through the storm and through the night.
[1591.66 → 1597.06] I will wait for you, surely wait for you.
[1597.24 → 1602.30] For your love is my delight.
[1602.66 → 1607.80] I will wait for you, I will wait for you.
[1608.16 → 1611.90] On your word I will rely on.
[1611.90 → 1618.68] I will wait for you, surely wait for you.
[1618.68 → 1623.26] Till my soul is satisfied.
[1641.90 → 1647.48] Shoot.
[1647.48 → 1649.78] I will wait for you, Peter.
[1665.68 → 1666.62] I will wait for you, Billy.
[1666.62 → 1672.92] This is my prayer in the desert
[1672.92 → 1679.94] When all that's within me feels dry
[1679.94 → 1688.06] This is my prayer in my hunger and need
[1688.06 → 1693.18] My God is the God who provides
[1693.18 → 1698.80] This is my prayer in the fire
[1698.80 → 1704.92] In weakness or trial or rain
[1704.92 → 1712.02] There is a faith proved of more worth and gold
[1712.02 → 1716.78] So we finally, Lord, through the flame
[1716.78 → 1722.68] I will bring praise, I will bring praise
[1722.68 → 1728.30] The weapon formed against me shall remain
[1728.30 → 1733.68] I will rejoice, I will declare
[1733.68 → 1739.80] God is my victory, and He is free
[1739.80 → 1754.42] This is my prayer in the battle
[1754.42 → 1759.42] When triumph is still on its way
[1759.42 → 1767.04] I am a conqueror and cold air with Christ
[1767.04 → 1771.04] So firm on His promise I'll stand
[1771.04 → 1777.04] I will bring praise, I will bring praise
[1777.04 → 1782.66] No weapon formed against me shall remain
[1782.66 → 1788.04] I will rejoice, I will defend
[1788.04 → 1794.04] God is my victory, and He is here
[1794.04 → 1799.66] All of my life
[1799.66 → 1801.66] All of my life
[1801.66 → 1803.66] In every season
[1803.66 → 1806.66] You are still God
[1806.66 → 1811.66] I have a reason to sing
[1811.66 → 1817.04] I have a reason to worship
[1817.04 → 1823.66] All of my life
[1823.66 → 1824.66] All of my life
[1824.66 → 1825.66] In every season
[1825.66 → 1828.66] You are still God
[1828.66 → 1831.66] I have a reason to sing
[1831.66 → 1835.66] I have a reason to worship
[1835.66 → 1843.28] I have a reason to worship
[1843.28 → 1846.28] All of my life
[1846.28 → 1848.28] In every season
[1848.28 → 1851.28] You are still God
[1851.28 → 1855.28] I have a reason to sing
[1855.28 → 1856.28] I have a reason to sing
[1856.28 → 1857.28] I have a reason to sing
[1857.28 → 1862.28] I will bring praise
[1862.28 → 1867.28] I will bring praise
[1867.28 → 1870.10] I will bring praise
[1870.10 → 1874.90] No weapon formed against me shall remain
[1874.90 → 1877.28] I will rejoice
[1877.28 → 1878.28] I will rejoice
[1878.28 → 1880.44] I will declare
[1880.44 → 1883.28] God is my victory
[1883.82 → 1887.14] And He is here
[1887.14 → 1901.38] This is my prayer in the harvest
[1901.38 → 1906.58] When favour and providence glow
[1906.58 → 1913.38] I know I feel to be emptied again
[1913.94 → 1916.38] The seed I've received
[1917.04 → 1919.08] I will sow
[1919.08 → 1923.48] Please be seated
[1931.38 → 1941.58] Good morning
[1941.58 → 1943.22] My name is Brenda
[1943.22 → 1944.80] And I am a deacon here at Emanuel
[1944.80 → 1946.66] We continue our worship

[1955.16 → 1956.82] Is for the Langley Food Bank

[1986.12 → 1988.34] At the Food Bank
[1988.34 → 1989.22] We believe
[1989.22 → 1990.84] God has a special concern
[1990.84 → 1992.24] For those who cannot care
[1992.24 → 1993.28] For their own needs
[1993.28 → 1995.48] He clearly calls his people
[1995.48 → 1996.70] To share his concern
[1996.70 → 1998.42] And express his compassion
[1998.42 → 1999.70] To the poor and needy
[1999.70 → 2001.86] God's call to the church
[2001.86 → 2004.30] Is to identify with the poor
[2004.30 → 2004.80] The weak
[2004.80 → 2005.50] And the vulnerable
[2005.50 → 2007.26] And to invest our time
[2007.26 → 2008.30] Energy and money
[2008.30 → 2009.28] In serving them
[2009.28 → 2011.22] The long-term objective
[2011.76 → 2013.06] In all that we do

[2019.80 → 2021.14] From a life of poverty
[2021.14 → 2022.94] To a life of productivity
[2022.94 → 2023.84] And hope
[2023.84 → 2025.74] We recognize
[2025.74 → 2027.14] The absolute need
[2027.14 → 2028.24] For the intervention
[2028.24 → 2029.84] And work of the Holy Spirit
[2029.84 → 2031.94] As crucial to this process
[2031.94 → 2033.92] As well as the vital necessity
[2033.92 → 2035.62] For a new and ongoing
[2035.62 → 2037.20] Relationship with God the Father

[2046.06 → 2047.22] Of its volunteers
[2047.22 → 2048.68] Because actions
[2048.68 → 2050.56] Speak louder than words
[2050.56 → 2053.94] Actions will often create
[2053.94 → 2054.78] The pathway
[2054.78 → 2056.82] For the words to be heard
[2056.82 → 2058.80] Tomorrow

[2086.10 → 2087.90] Verse 18
[2087.90 → 2088.36] Says
[2088.36 → 2089.52] Dear children
[2089.52 → 2090.60] Let us not love
[2090.60 → 2091.22] With words
[2091.22 → 2092.24] Or speech
[2092.24 → 2093.44] But with actions

[2245.22 → 2247.22] Thank you.
[2275.22 → 2277.22] Thank you.
[2305.22 → 2307.22] Thank you.
[2335.22 → 2337.22] Thank you.
[2365.22 → 2367.22] Thank you.
[2395.22 → 2397.22] Thank you.

[2429.22 → 2431.22] Thank you.
[2431.22 → 2433.22] Thank you.

[2437.22 → 2439.22] Thank you.
[2439.22 → 2441.22] Thank you.
[2441.22 → 2443.22] Thank you.
[2443.22 → 2447.22] Thank you.
[2447.22 → 2449.22] Thank you.
[2449.22 → 2451.22] Thank you.
[2451.22 → 2453.22] Thank you.
[2453.22 → 2460.40] bow our heads and go to our God in prayer. Our Lord and our God, we praise and worship your holy
[2460.40 → 2467.10] name on this beautiful sunny morning. Your name alone is exalted. Your splendour is above the earth
[2467.10 → 2473.04] and the heavens. As we've been experiencing an extended season of warmth and sunny weather,
[2473.34 → 2479.74] we can't help but see the beauty of the creation all around us. From the mighty oceans to the
[2479.74 → 2485.80] majestic mountains and everything in between, all the earth worships you. With the psalmist and as
[2485.80 → 2490.98] we have sung this morning, we lift our eyes up to the mountains and say, where does our help come from?
[2491.60 → 2496.90] Our help comes from you, Lord, maker of heaven and earth, you who will not let our foot slip.
[2497.60 → 2502.92] You watch over us without slumber, and so we lift our praise and our requests to you this morning
[2502.92 → 2509.44] as your people. Lord, we pray for our upcoming general election that's going to take place on
[2509.44 → 2514.76] Saturday locally. And we thank you, Lord, for all the candidates who are running. We pray for your
[2514.76 → 2519.40] blessing and for success for the candidates who seek your will in positions of leadership.
[2520.66 → 2525.90] Lord, encourage us as voters to put in our preparation time and to seek your will as we vote.
[2526.94 → 2532.96] We pray for all political leaders at all levels of government. Lord, we know that all authority
[2532.96 → 2541.00] comes from you. We pray, Lord, as we enter the season of Thanksgiving, a prayer of thanks. We have so much
[2541.00 → 2548.02] to be thankful for. Here in this place, we have peace, prosperity, freedoms. Lord, help us to use
[2548.02 → 2553.82] these things for your kingdom. Bless us as we gather again tomorrow as a congregation in our Thanksgiving
[2553.82 → 2562.54] service, and let it be a time of uplifting time for us to give thanks to you. Lord, there are so many
[2562.54 → 2569.42] concerns we have for our world and for each other in this time as well. We pray, Lord, for the hurricanes
[2569.42 → 2575.84] that have been taking place and for the people who were impacted by Hurricane Ian and here in Canada by
[2575.84 → 2582.84] Hurricane Fiona. Lord, livelihoods and possessions have been damaged. We pray for all those who are working
[2582.84 → 2589.70] on the cleanup efforts and those who are patiently waiting for the next outcome of this situation.
[2591.22 → 2597.00] Lord, we pray for the situations throughout the world of strife and unrest and war. We continue to
[2597.00 → 2602.64] uphold Ukraine. Lord, this ongoing struggle has gone on for so long, and there's no end in sight.
[2602.92 → 2611.22] We pray, Lord, for peace. We also pray for our relationships and for ourselves here at home in our
[2611.22 → 2615.80] families and among each other. Lord, many relationships are strained and some broken,
[2616.08 → 2623.76] and God, we pray for healing and reconciliation. Lord, we also pray with those who mourn the loss of
[2623.76 → 2631.70] loved ones. Some have lost many who are just, who have gone too soon, and Lord, we pray for comfort and
[2631.70 → 2639.20] peace. We're not always ready to see our loved ones go on before us, Lord, and we pray for your help to be
[2639.20 → 2644.98] our support, Lord, that you would give us comfort and bring us to you in this time of mourning.
[2646.18 → 2652.32] We also pray for everyone in our midst, Lord, who's dealing with pain and illness. Lord, you are the God
[2652.32 → 2659.48] of healing. We ask for healing for those who have illness and injury and bodies that are growing older
[2659.48 → 2665.28] and dealing with challenges and struggles that come with that. And Lord, we also pray for those
[2665.28 → 2670.72] who are dealing with different challenges with mental health. Lord, we sometimes experience deep
[2670.72 → 2678.60] sorrow in our hearts. Some feel forgotten and alone. Some feel anxiety and depression and to some extent
[2678.60 → 2685.04] defeated. And sometimes, Lord, we find ourselves wrestling every day with our thoughts. Bring us your
[2685.04 → 2690.68] peace, your comfort, and you're healing that we can say with the psalmist, though all these things are
[2690.68 → 2697.40] happening. But I will trust in your unfailing love. My heart rejoices in your salvation. I will sing the
[2697.40 → 2706.76] Lord's praise, for you have been good to us. And Lord, as we go into our message now from our pastor,
[2706.90 → 2712.14] and Lord, as you lead us into your word, we pray that you would speak to us. And then as we have
[2712.14 → 2716.90] communion together, Lord, we pray that we would experience nourishment, strength, and comfort together
[2716.90 → 2721.34] through the sacrament. And Lord, we ask all these things in Jesus' name. Amen.
[2721.34 → 2721.46] Amen.
[2721.46 → 2722.46] Amen.
[2741.96 → 2750.24] We are indeed going to open God's word together, continue in that time of worship.
[2750.24 → 2758.34] we're going to read from Psalm 77, the first nine verses. It will be on the screen overhead,
[2758.66 → 2763.20] but I encourage you to have a Bible in your hands, either one that you flip open or one
[2763.20 → 2771.56] that you flick open, and we can have that together. Before I begin with the text,
[2772.56 → 2778.98] I was thinking about this week and the kinds of things that we're doing here together, and
[2780.24 → 2787.50] the work of preaching through the Psalms and exploring our emotions, and I was reminded of a
[2787.50 → 2794.80] story. This happened to Rachel and me and my wife a number of years ago. I think actually I was trying
[2794.80 → 2800.74] to place it when we were living in Grand Rapids, so that's like 20 years ago. I'm getting old.
[2801.64 → 2803.00] That just hit me.
[2806.20 → 2808.96] Whatever, it says someone older than me. Grave, thank you.
[2810.24 → 2818.86] So we were walking through a mall, just casually out for a walk. We haven't been casually out for
[2818.86 → 2825.00] a walk to a mall since we had kids, but here we were walking through this mall, and we were just
[2825.00 → 2831.78] chatting away, and then off in front of us, coming around a corner, you know how malls are sort of
[2831.78 → 2839.06] arranged like labyrinthian, so you get lost in them. Anyway, this older woman came around the
[2839.06 → 2846.38] corner. She must have been 70, 75 years old, and she started walking, and as she walked by, everybody
[2846.38 → 2853.36] kind of kept looking at her, and we were like, what's going on? And then she got in front of us, and
[2853.36 → 2863.98] somehow she was wearing this like long, flowy skirt, and somehow, I'm assuming when she had gone to the
[2863.98 → 2872.60] bathroom previously, the back of her skirt got stuck in the top of her underwear. So here's a 75-year-old
[2872.60 → 2878.52] woman walking through the mall with her, I mean, I don't know what you call it anymore, but when we
[2878.52 → 2884.08] were kids, we called them granny parties, like just hanging out for everyone to see, and it was
[2884.08 → 2889.64] kind of embarrassing, and it was a little awkward, right? And people were looking and talking and
[2889.64 → 2895.66] whispering and not sure, should we go and talk, and no one's saying anything. So finally, Rachel, because
[2895.66 → 2900.24] she's super gracious and can enter into moments like that, walks up beside this woman and puts her
[2900.24 → 2905.90] hand on her shoulder and just whispers, your dress is stuck in your underwear, and then she tries to
[2905.90 → 2910.54] get it out and can't get it, so Rachel has to help her get it out. Anyway, it got clear, but it was awkward,
[2910.54 → 2920.66] right? And it was weird. Now, what made it even more awkward is that before Rachel went over to help
[2920.66 → 2928.94] her get it out, she stopped to tie her shoe, and that's what did it. That's when we went over and we,
[2930.54 → 2940.06] why do I share this story? Good question, right? Sometimes we need people
[2940.06 → 2948.84] to help us see things that we're blind to, and sometimes it's really awkward and hard to have
[2948.84 → 2953.26] those kinds of conversations. Now, that may be a funny anecdote about that, but the reality is
[2953.26 → 2959.52] sometimes someone comes along and tells us something about ourselves or about what's going on in our life,
[2959.52 → 2967.62] and we don't really want to hear it, and it's awkward, and it's embarrassing, or it's hard.
[2967.62 → 2975.82] This series through the Psalms and talking about our emotions may be that for some of you.
[2978.40 → 2984.52] Right? The things that we're talking about here are real, and they are raw, and for some,
[2984.82 → 2993.48] you may want to talk after, and I just pray that you find someone, whether it's me or Pastor Kevin,
[2993.48 → 3004.14] or it's a care group or an elder. What I know and believe is that God is going to speak this morning,
[3004.14 → 3012.36] and that when his word goes out, it accomplishes the purpose for which he sends it, and so if we
[3012.36 → 3016.80] need to talk together, or if you need to process that, or if you need to have someone come alongside
[3016.80 → 3026.06] you, I just pray that you would hear that and set something up. Now, as we enter into this Psalm,
[3027.20 → 3030.82] let's read together from Psalm 77.
[3030.82 → 3060.80] Psalm 77.
[3060.82 → 3090.80] Psalm 77.
[3090.80 → 3098.72] Has his unfailing love vanished forever? Has his promise failed for all time? Has God forgotten
[3098.72 → 3106.06] to be merciful? Has he, in anger, withheld his compassion?
[3108.80 → 3110.10] This is the word of the Lord.
[3110.10 → 3122.14] Now, this is one of those psalms that if you have the ears to hear it as you read it, or at least as I read it,
[3122.82 → 3126.40] my heart breaks for the psalmist.
[3126.40 → 3156.38] There is a crying out that takes place here, and in fact, it's a crying out that I know that some of you are living in the midst of right now. Some of you are sharing right now. And the reality here is that if I know that some of you are struggling with it, you can believe, and you can bet that there are others whom we don't know about, but who are nonetheless right here with Asaph, who is the psalmist.
[3156.40 → 3186.40] He writes this.
[3186.40 → 3194.18] That's what we're saying. That's what we feel. And then finally, what are we supposed to do instead, or what are we supposed to avoid?
[3194.18 → 3203.94] And so we are experiencing and looking at sorrow and heartbreak. And you can hear the words of the psalmist again, right?
[3204.18 → 3207.30] I cried out to God for help.
[3209.06 → 3216.44] Now, we don't know the exact situation of Asaph in this time, but we can extrapolate a few things.
[3216.44 → 3226.10] And so we can make a pretty informed guess as to what's going on based on where this psalm is located in the Psalter.
[3227.44 → 3231.50] The first 11 psalms of book 3, which is this.
[3231.56 → 3236.48] If you flip back a few pages, you can see the Psalter is broken up into book 1, 2, 3, 4.
[3236.48 → 3249.06] And then this psalm, and particularly in that section, Psalm 74, helps us see that maybe what's going on here is Asaph, as an Israelite,
[3249.86 → 3254.10] is reflecting on his experience of the exile, right?
[3254.14 → 3259.58] His experience of the Babylonians marching down from the north and just destroying Jerusalem.
[3259.58 → 3268.62] Now, if you know the history, in 586 BC, the Babylonian army, right, led by Nebuchadnezzar, marched down, come to Israel,
[3268.92 → 3274.58] and they destroyed Jerusalem, and they lay to waste the temple on the top of the mountain.
[3275.52 → 3280.88] Now, the temple is the crown jewel of Hebrew religion and society.
[3281.88 → 3284.96] The first temple, we call it because they did rebuild eventually,
[3284.96 → 3290.68] the first temple, the one built by Solomon, was magnificent and beyond compare.
[3292.06 → 3295.26] In fact, there's a story told in the book of Ezra,
[3296.08 → 3301.56] that even as the second temple was being built, 70 years later, after the exile,
[3302.12 → 3306.56] and people are celebrating the end of the exile and their return to the land,
[3306.90 → 3310.96] there are some who are old enough to have seen the first temple,
[3310.96 → 3313.44] and even as they're looking at the new foundations,
[3313.86 → 3316.22] even as they're celebrating the temple walls going up,
[3316.30 → 3319.22] these people who remember the old temple weep
[3319.22 → 3323.70] because it just paled in comparison.
[3326.34 → 3333.14] The point is that Asaph is probably sometime before the rebuild,
[3333.14 → 3337.18] and so you can picture him standing in the rubble,
[3337.88 → 3340.84] in the ruins of the temple,
[3341.44 → 3345.56] and it feels to him at that moment as he looks around, right,
[3345.64 → 3351.46] the dwelling place of God, the place where God resides with his people are gone,
[3351.70 → 3355.24] and so it feels to him like God is gone.
[3355.24 → 3359.56] I cried out to God for help.
[3360.12 → 3362.88] I cried out to God to hear me.
[3364.00 → 3369.78] Not only does he need help, but he doesn't feel heard in his need.
[3370.80 → 3371.68] Do you know that feeling?
[3373.04 → 3375.40] Right, where you just don't understand.
[3375.94 → 3377.66] You're not hearing what I'm saying.
[3377.66 → 3383.86] And then, Asaph does everything right.
[3385.42 → 3386.60] Look at verse 2.
[3387.88 → 3390.56] When I was in distress, I sought the Lord.
[3391.88 → 3395.40] At night, I stretched out untiring hands.
[3396.56 → 3400.50] He's in distress, he needs help, and he craves to be heard,
[3400.82 → 3402.04] and so he goes to God.
[3403.44 → 3407.24] That phrase, at night, I stretched out untiring hands,
[3407.98 → 3410.26] that's a posture of prayer.
[3411.98 → 3415.28] There's a story in Exodus 17
[3415.28 → 3419.14] where the Israelites are wandering through the Sinai Peninsula,
[3419.36 → 3421.98] and they're being harangued by the Malecite throughout,
[3422.16 → 3423.56] and there's a battle that takes place
[3423.56 → 3426.78] between the Israelites and the Malecite.
[3427.76 → 3430.82] And Moses is standing on a ridge overlooking this battle,
[3430.82 → 3434.46] and as long as Moses is stretching out his hands,
[3434.88 → 3436.64] the Israelites are winning the battle.
[3437.24 → 3441.26] They're able to defeat the superior enemy that is the Malecite.
[3441.34 → 3444.72] But as Moses gets tired and his hands start to fall,
[3445.14 → 3446.80] the Israelites are losing the battle.
[3447.82 → 3450.70] And so God is with them in the battle,
[3450.80 → 3452.60] insofar as Moses, their leader,
[3452.72 → 3455.60] is able to pray and hold his hands up.
[3455.72 → 3457.72] And so Aaron and Her,
[3458.16 → 3460.58] Moses' left and right-hand men,
[3460.94 → 3463.68] hold up his hands for him as he gets tired.
[3463.68 → 3468.62] Point is, that image of praying with untiring hands,
[3468.96 → 3471.30] is Asaph's way of saying,
[3471.72 → 3473.38] God, fight my battle.
[3476.38 → 3479.46] Now there's also a connection in this image
[3479.46 → 3483.16] to the story of Job and his friends,
[3483.84 → 3486.00] and what his friends tell Job.
[3486.00 → 3488.48] Now maybe you remember the story of Job.
[3489.08 → 3493.18] It's a story that is told and recorded in the Bible
[3493.18 → 3497.06] as an attempt to try and make sense
[3497.06 → 3499.10] of why there is evil in the world.
[3500.12 → 3500.32] Right?
[3500.38 → 3503.60] Why bad things happen to good people.
[3504.54 → 3507.04] Now it's worth a look if you haven't read it before,
[3507.42 → 3509.84] but Job in that story has lost everything.
[3510.62 → 3512.68] He's had everything taken from him by the devil.
[3512.68 → 3512.98] Right?
[3513.64 → 3514.98] His possessions have been taken.
[3515.34 → 3516.72] His children have died.
[3517.02 → 3518.16] His wife, at one point,
[3518.22 → 3520.18] tells him to curse God and die.
[3521.14 → 3522.50] That's how bad it gets for him.
[3523.58 → 3526.02] And sitting in sackcloth and ashes,
[3526.56 → 3528.98] he curses the day of his birth.
[3529.56 → 3530.92] Says it would have been better,
[3530.96 → 3531.72] it would have been better
[3531.72 → 3534.06] if he'd not been born at all.
[3534.76 → 3535.40] And he says,
[3535.40 → 3539.02] What I feared has come upon me.
[3539.54 → 3541.76] What I dreaded has happened to me.
[3542.12 → 3544.28] I have no peace, no quietness.
[3544.40 → 3547.22] I have no rest, but only turmoil.
[3548.48 → 3549.72] Now here's the part I want you to hear.
[3551.08 → 3552.92] Into this circumstance,
[3553.14 → 3555.10] into this moment of Job's experience,
[3555.44 → 3556.44] his friends come.
[3556.98 → 3558.78] And they sit with him for a few days,
[3558.96 → 3560.40] and then they start to speak.
[3560.70 → 3561.98] And that's when it all goes to pop.
[3561.98 → 3563.82] They sit with him,
[3563.86 → 3565.68] and eventually one of them says to him,
[3567.00 → 3568.08] this is in Job 11,
[3569.48 → 3572.04] Yet, if you devote your heart to him,
[3572.14 → 3572.92] that is to God,
[3573.18 → 3575.30] if you stretch out your hands to him,
[3575.36 → 3576.96] there's that image, right?
[3577.00 → 3577.66] And what's he saying?
[3577.74 → 3579.24] If you really believe,
[3579.52 → 3581.02] if you have enough faith,
[3581.22 → 3582.92] if you pray hard enough,
[3583.72 → 3586.96] if you put away the sin that is in your hand,
[3587.00 → 3589.24] and allow no evil to dwell in your tent,
[3589.24 → 3590.06] again, right?
[3590.08 → 3591.20] If you do good,
[3591.38 → 3593.94] and work really hard at being obedient,
[3594.56 → 3595.56] here's the implication,
[3595.72 → 3596.30] or the conclusion.
[3597.10 → 3599.54] Life will be brighter than noonday,
[3599.72 → 3601.74] and darkness will become like morning.
[3602.38 → 3603.66] You will be secure,
[3603.84 → 3604.94] because there is hope.
[3605.30 → 3606.40] You will look about you,
[3606.48 → 3608.08] and take rest in safety.
[3608.50 → 3609.54] You will lie down,
[3609.68 → 3610.34] and no one,
[3610.50 → 3611.98] with no one to make you afraid,
[3612.32 → 3615.22] and many will count your favour.
[3615.22 → 3621.40] Now read that back over top of Psalm 77.
[3622.54 → 3624.04] When I was in distress,
[3624.38 → 3625.36] I sought the Lord.
[3626.02 → 3628.98] At night, I stretched out untiring hands.
[3629.48 → 3630.98] I did everything right.
[3632.56 → 3636.66] I asked God with untiring religious effort.
[3636.98 → 3638.64] I prayed, and prayed, and prayed,
[3638.78 → 3639.74] and I did good,
[3639.94 → 3642.98] and I followed all the advice of Job's friends.
[3642.98 → 3645.78] And then what does Psalm 77 has Asaph say?
[3645.86 → 3647.08] After doing everything right,
[3648.48 → 3652.90] I would not be comforted.
[3655.14 → 3657.18] You said life would be better,
[3658.18 → 3660.24] but it only got darker.
[3661.56 → 3663.42] You said that I would have rest,
[3663.72 → 3664.12] and hope,
[3664.24 → 3665.30] and have nothing to fear,
[3665.58 → 3667.68] that this would work out for my favour.
[3667.82 → 3669.04] You said it would go away,
[3669.26 → 3670.50] but that's not what's happening.
[3670.50 → 3673.42] Look at verse 3.
[3675.24 → 3676.68] I remembered you, God,
[3677.40 → 3678.96] and I groaned.
[3680.10 → 3682.50] Now, this isn't just a dismissive,
[3683.38 → 3685.42] pre-teen girl,
[3685.52 → 3687.44] rolling of the eyes kind of groaning.
[3688.48 → 3689.34] I know that one well.
[3690.68 → 3693.58] Isaiah and Jeremiah used this same word
[3693.58 → 3696.98] to describe the roaring of the sea's waves.
[3696.98 → 3699.52] They used this same word
[3699.52 → 3701.58] to describe the growling of a bear.
[3703.00 → 3705.12] So this groaning is a visceral,
[3705.38 → 3707.16] guttural, soul-crushing,
[3707.48 → 3709.80] and soul-crushed groan.
[3711.26 → 3712.06] The psalmist goes on,
[3712.78 → 3713.14] and he says,
[3713.76 → 3714.54] I meditated,
[3715.08 → 3717.26] and my spirit grew faint.
[3718.84 → 3719.80] Now, in the Bible,
[3719.80 → 3723.78] almost every time the word
[3723.78 → 3725.14] meditated is used,
[3726.38 → 3728.34] it refers to reflecting on
[3728.34 → 3729.46] the Word of God.
[3730.48 → 3730.94] So when he says,
[3731.06 → 3731.66] I meditated,
[3731.76 → 3733.32] it means he went to the Word of God.
[3733.40 → 3734.22] He went to the Torah.
[3734.68 → 3736.50] He dove into what God had to say.
[3736.84 → 3737.62] I meditated,
[3737.78 → 3739.02] and my spirit grew faint.
[3740.46 → 3741.18] In the Bible,
[3741.50 → 3742.08] again, right,
[3742.26 → 3743.48] we'll zoom out a little bit here,
[3743.58 → 3744.68] the Word of God
[3744.68 → 3746.26] brings life.
[3747.32 → 3748.82] Think about the very beginning
[3748.82 → 3749.60] of the story.
[3749.92 → 3750.68] In Genesis 1,
[3751.32 → 3752.52] in the creation of the world,
[3752.64 → 3753.14] God said,
[3753.38 → 3754.20] let there be light,
[3754.32 → 3756.68] and there was light.
[3757.50 → 3757.70] Right?
[3757.78 → 3758.16] God said,
[3758.28 → 3759.10] let there be life,
[3759.16 → 3760.38] and there was life.
[3760.52 → 3762.54] God's Word brings life.
[3762.64 → 3763.96] He speaks life.
[3764.82 → 3766.70] In Ezekiel 37,
[3767.54 → 3768.54] there's this beautiful
[3768.54 → 3770.08] and powerful
[3770.08 → 3772.48] illustration of this.
[3773.24 → 3774.40] It's a story of God
[3774.40 → 3776.18] appearing to Ezekiel
[3776.18 → 3777.20] and showing him
[3777.20 → 3779.80] a valley full of dry bones,
[3780.20 → 3780.34] right,
[3780.40 → 3781.26] in an ancient army,
[3781.46 → 3781.82] probably.
[3783.26 → 3784.74] And God asks Ezekiel,
[3785.12 → 3785.50] he says,
[3785.58 → 3786.76] can these bones live?
[3787.88 → 3788.62] And Ezekiel says,
[3788.74 → 3789.50] only you know,
[3789.96 → 3790.20] God.
[3791.20 → 3792.56] And so God tells Ezekiel,
[3792.94 → 3794.78] prophesy to these bones.
[3795.48 → 3796.50] And Ezekiel starts
[3796.50 → 3797.50] prophesying to them,
[3797.62 → 3798.18] and the bones
[3798.18 → 3799.36] start coming together,
[3799.36 → 3800.94] and they start standing up,
[3801.04 → 3801.72] and then sinew,
[3801.84 → 3802.28] and muscle,
[3802.46 → 3802.94] and flesh
[3802.94 → 3804.44] starts surrounding
[3804.44 → 3805.14] these bones
[3805.14 → 3806.12] as they stand there,
[3806.26 → 3807.92] and then God says again to him,
[3808.22 → 3810.02] can these bones have life?
[3810.36 → 3811.10] And Ezekiel says,
[3811.30 → 3811.96] only you know,
[3812.10 → 3812.24] Lord.
[3813.02 → 3813.80] And God says,
[3814.02 → 3815.28] preach to these bones.
[3815.40 → 3816.58] And so Ezekiel preaches,
[3816.86 → 3818.12] and the spirit wind
[3818.12 → 3818.80] blows down
[3818.80 → 3819.80] through that valley,
[3820.04 → 3822.18] and these beings
[3822.18 → 3824.00] now come back to life.
[3825.08 → 3825.26] Right?
[3825.28 → 3826.44] The Word of God
[3826.44 → 3827.92] brings life.
[3828.96 → 3829.98] And all of this
[3829.98 → 3831.16] sort of anticipates,
[3831.16 → 3832.44] for those of you
[3832.44 → 3833.82] who have read
[3833.82 → 3835.22] the Gospel of John,
[3835.88 → 3838.70] Peter and the twelve
[3838.70 → 3839.74] are walking with Jesus,
[3839.90 → 3840.60] and a number of people
[3840.60 → 3841.32] have left
[3841.32 → 3842.86] and fled away
[3842.86 → 3843.74] from helping Jesus,
[3843.90 → 3844.72] and Jesus turns
[3844.72 → 3845.46] to the twelve,
[3845.84 → 3846.36] and he says,
[3846.44 → 3847.20] are you too
[3847.20 → 3848.68] going to leave me?
[3849.90 → 3850.98] And Peter answers,
[3851.16 → 3851.48] he says,
[3851.48 → 3852.78] where shall we go,
[3853.08 → 3853.18] Lord?
[3854.04 → 3855.74] For you have the words
[3855.74 → 3857.32] of eternal life.
[3858.66 → 3859.64] The Word of God
[3859.64 → 3861.42] is supposed to bring life,
[3861.52 → 3863.08] but where the psalmist is,
[3863.58 → 3864.50] I meditated,
[3864.70 → 3865.94] and my spirit grew faint.
[3866.20 → 3867.32] Where the psalmist is,
[3867.40 → 3868.06] he meditates
[3868.06 → 3869.10] on the words of God,
[3869.16 → 3869.80] and his spirit
[3869.80 → 3870.86] grows faint.
[3871.14 → 3872.24] It saps him.
[3872.44 → 3873.74] It doesn't give him life.
[3874.00 → 3874.90] There's something going on
[3874.90 → 3875.80] that makes it draining
[3875.80 → 3876.74] and oppressive,
[3876.86 → 3877.54] not filling
[3877.54 → 3878.38] and abundant.
[3878.84 → 3880.54] He's not in a place
[3880.54 → 3882.56] where he can hear
[3882.56 → 3883.70] these truths
[3883.70 → 3885.74] as an encouragement.
[3887.10 → 3887.54] Instead,
[3888.04 → 3888.74] in his heart,
[3888.74 → 3890.04] he is in a place
[3890.04 → 3891.00] where he looks
[3891.00 → 3891.86] at the faithfulness
[3891.86 → 3892.34] of God,
[3892.44 → 3893.30] he looks at the power
[3893.30 → 3893.84] of God,
[3893.94 → 3894.70] and he says,
[3894.92 → 3895.68] what's up with that?
[3896.52 → 3897.18] Why aren't you
[3897.18 → 3898.00] doing that again?
[3899.74 → 3900.54] Why aren't you
[3900.54 → 3901.30] doing that here?
[3902.26 → 3903.44] I know who you are.
[3903.52 → 3904.14] Why aren't you
[3904.14 → 3905.26] doing this?
[3907.58 → 3907.92] If you
[3907.92 → 3910.14] haven't seen it,
[3910.18 → 3910.78] haven't figured out
[3910.78 → 3912.04] where we're going,
[3913.04 → 3914.34] I believe that there's
[3914.34 → 3916.56] something of us all
[3916.56 → 3917.22] here,
[3918.22 → 3918.80] how we can relate
[3918.80 → 3919.64] to this circumstance
[3919.64 → 3920.78] and this situation.
[3921.40 → 3922.22] We can relate
[3922.22 → 3922.92] to the cries
[3922.92 → 3923.76] of Asaph
[3923.76 → 3924.98] at this moment.
[3925.32 → 3925.96] Maybe that's you
[3925.96 → 3926.34] right now.
[3927.62 → 3928.36] Maybe this is
[3928.36 → 3929.02] your voice.
[3929.86 → 3930.56] Or maybe you are
[3930.56 → 3931.70] remembering a time
[3931.70 → 3933.28] when that was you.
[3933.48 → 3934.82] But I am confident
[3934.82 → 3935.98] that each and every
[3935.98 → 3936.74] one of us
[3936.74 → 3937.80] can relate to
[3937.80 → 3938.38] what's happening
[3938.38 → 3939.66] in this psalm.
[3939.66 → 3945.38] Allende and Longman
[3945.38 → 3946.76] in their book
[3946.76 → 3947.76] The Cry of the Soul
[3947.76 → 3949.36] have a quote
[3949.36 → 3950.72] that cut me
[3950.72 → 3951.72] this week.
[3951.80 → 3952.32] And by that I mean
[3952.32 → 3953.62] it spoke directly
[3953.62 → 3954.84] to my heart.
[3956.06 → 3956.52] If you were here
[3956.52 → 3957.22] last week,
[3957.30 → 3958.52] you will recall
[3958.52 → 3959.24] that their book
[3959.24 → 3960.06] The Cry of the Soul
[3960.06 → 3960.98] is one of the books
[3960.98 → 3961.80] that we are using
[3961.80 → 3962.60] to help frame
[3962.60 → 3963.48] this series
[3963.48 → 3964.22] to provide
[3964.22 → 3964.64] a sort of
[3964.64 → 3965.70] biblical and spiritual
[3965.70 → 3967.34] counselling conversation
[3967.34 → 3968.22] about our emotions
[3968.22 → 3969.16] and how to handle
[3969.16 → 3969.66] them well
[3969.66 → 3970.78] and process them
[3970.78 → 3971.92] in faithfulness
[3971.92 → 3972.26] to God.
[3973.08 → 3973.66] And they write,
[3974.94 → 3976.02] Emotions are the
[3976.02 → 3977.12] cry of the soul.
[3977.96 → 3978.50] They expose
[3978.50 → 3979.40] what we are doing
[3979.40 → 3980.04] with the sorrow
[3980.04 → 3980.74] of life
[3980.74 → 3982.14] and in turn
[3982.14 → 3983.36] reveal what our
[3983.36 → 3984.38] heart is doing
[3984.38 → 3985.40] with God.
[3986.80 → 3987.76] It's the second
[3987.76 → 3988.62] half of that line
[3988.62 → 3989.30] that gets me.
[3990.60 → 3991.22] Our emotions
[3991.22 → 3992.00] in turn
[3992.00 → 3993.16] reveal what our
[3993.16 → 3994.52] heart is doing
[3994.52 → 3995.52] with God.
[3996.88 → 3997.56] Psalm 77
[3997.56 → 3998.46] helps me see
[3998.46 → 3999.28] how I do that.
[4000.34 → 4000.88] How we all
[4000.88 → 4002.14] do that.
[4003.40 → 4004.12] When things are
[4004.12 → 4004.90] hard
[4004.90 → 4005.64] and the emotions
[4005.64 → 4006.36] are big
[4006.36 → 4007.54] and they are raw,
[4007.90 → 4008.72] how easily
[4008.72 → 4010.24] do we turn
[4010.24 → 4010.82] God
[4010.82 → 4011.76] into a kind of
[4011.76 → 4012.96] phone-a-friend
[4012.96 → 4013.96] helpline?
[4016.16 → 4016.64] Right?
[4016.68 → 4016.82] Or
[4016.82 → 4017.82] another
[4017.82 → 4018.72] illustration
[4018.72 → 4019.76] that came to me
[4019.76 → 4020.24] that
[4020.24 → 4022.24] who among us
[4022.24 → 4023.70] thinks of God
[4023.70 → 4024.56] kind of like
[4024.56 → 4025.38] a vending machine?
[4026.54 → 4026.78] Right?
[4026.78 → 4027.64] Where you put
[4027.64 → 4028.46] the quarter
[4028.46 → 4029.36] or the dollar
[4029.36 → 4030.54] of your obedience
[4030.54 → 4031.02] in.
[4032.22 → 4032.44] Right?
[4032.48 → 4033.16] And then we enter
[4033.16 → 4033.88] in the number
[4033.88 → 4035.18] of our right
[4035.18 → 4035.92] prayer and
[4035.92 → 4037.02] religious attitudes
[4037.02 → 4037.76] and actions
[4037.76 → 4038.98] and then we get
[4038.98 → 4039.40] what we want
[4039.40 → 4039.84] in return.
[4041.56 → 4042.06] Right?
[4042.06 → 4042.70] Remember the story
[4042.70 → 4043.10] of Job.
[4043.94 → 4044.82] The story that was
[4044.82 → 4045.52] written to answer
[4045.52 → 4046.06] the question
[4046.06 → 4046.56] in part
[4046.56 → 4047.26] why do bad
[4047.26 → 4047.78] things happen
[4047.78 → 4048.48] to good people?
[4049.66 → 4050.48] The reason
[4050.48 → 4051.94] that that is a
[4051.94 → 4052.34] question
[4052.34 → 4053.00] why do bad
[4053.00 → 4053.42] things happen
[4053.42 → 4054.00] to good people
[4054.00 → 4054.68] is because
[4054.68 → 4055.14] there is a
[4055.14 → 4055.68] presumption
[4055.68 → 4056.26] that exists
[4056.26 → 4056.90] in our
[4056.90 → 4057.54] culture
[4057.54 → 4057.98] Christian
[4057.98 → 4059.24] and increasingly
[4059.24 → 4059.72] otherwise
[4059.72 → 4060.92] that exists
[4060.92 → 4061.66] in our culture
[4061.66 → 4063.22] that assumes
[4063.22 → 4065.20] that good
[4065.20 → 4066.06] people
[4066.06 → 4067.00] shouldn't have
[4067.00 → 4067.58] bad things
[4067.58 → 4068.20] happen to them.
[4069.24 → 4069.32] Right?
[4069.34 → 4069.90] That because
[4069.90 → 4070.96] we do good
[4070.96 → 4071.66] right
[4071.66 → 4072.62] God should only
[4072.62 → 4073.54] give us good things.
[4074.12 → 4075.04] There's a presumption
[4075.04 → 4075.70] that exists
[4075.70 → 4076.28] like I said
[4076.28 → 4077.10] in our prosperous
[4077.10 → 4078.52] 21st century world
[4078.52 → 4079.68] that we ought to be
[4079.68 → 4080.20] protected
[4080.20 → 4081.04] from hardships.
[4081.04 → 4082.50] And maybe
[4082.50 → 4083.08] that protection
[4083.08 → 4083.86] comes from God
[4083.86 → 4084.46] maybe it's from
[4084.46 → 4084.92] family
[4084.92 → 4085.84] maybe it's by
[4085.84 → 4087.10] our work
[4087.10 → 4087.84] and our efforts
[4087.84 → 4088.58] and our labours
[4088.58 → 4089.38] maybe it's our jobs
[4089.38 → 4090.74] maybe it's by the government
[4090.74 → 4092.40] either way
[4092.40 → 4095.02] we easily
[4095.02 → 4096.26] believe
[4096.26 → 4097.76] that these sorts
[4097.76 → 4098.08] of things
[4098.08 → 4098.80] shouldn't happen.
[4103.24 → 4103.84] Why?
[4105.68 → 4106.80] Why should that
[4106.80 → 4107.26] be true?
[4109.46 → 4109.76] In fact
[4109.76 → 4110.78] what about
[4110.78 → 4111.80] your experience
[4111.80 → 4112.48] of life
[4112.48 → 4113.42] says that
[4113.42 → 4114.24] that has to be true?
[4116.56 → 4116.76] I mean
[4116.76 → 4117.24] if we're honest
[4117.24 → 4117.96] I think probably
[4117.96 → 4118.60] the opposite
[4118.60 → 4119.92] for most of us
[4119.92 → 4121.40] should be true.
[4121.78 → 4121.98] And yet
[4121.98 → 4122.76] for some reason
[4122.76 → 4123.84] in our heart of hearts
[4123.84 → 4124.96] that's how we
[4124.96 → 4125.84] see the world
[4125.84 → 4126.74] and then
[4126.74 → 4128.64] that's how
[4128.64 → 4129.72] we see God.
[4131.18 → 4131.66] Right?
[4131.72 → 4132.56] The impact
[4132.56 → 4133.26] of that way
[4133.26 → 4134.08] of thinking
[4134.08 → 4135.46] puts God
[4135.46 → 4136.34] in our debt.
[4137.38 → 4137.52] Right?
[4137.54 → 4138.30] That somehow
[4138.30 → 4139.82] we have
[4139.82 → 4141.20] power over God
[4141.20 → 4142.60] to manipulate him
[4142.60 → 4144.06] and to coerce him
[4144.06 → 4145.00] into acting
[4145.00 → 4145.84] on our behalf.
[4146.96 → 4147.80] Now this shows up
[4147.80 → 4148.66] so many ways
[4148.66 → 4149.74] in our lives.
[4151.02 → 4151.18] Right?
[4151.26 → 4152.26] A couple examples
[4152.26 → 4152.88] and these are just
[4152.88 → 4153.60] scattershot.
[4154.16 → 4155.14] I've been good
[4155.14 → 4156.04] all my life
[4156.04 → 4156.74] why doesn't God
[4156.74 → 4157.44] give me a husband?
[4159.94 → 4160.94] I've never cheated
[4160.94 → 4161.58] on anything.
[4162.08 → 4163.52] I did everything right.
[4163.52 → 4164.80] why won't God
[4164.80 → 4165.82] get me into that school?
[4167.98 → 4168.18] Right?
[4168.20 → 4168.66] I've prayed
[4168.66 → 4169.44] all the prayers
[4169.44 → 4170.00] and I've read
[4170.00 → 4170.86] all the scriptures.
[4171.32 → 4171.92] I read the Bible
[4171.92 → 4172.58] back to back
[4172.58 → 4173.32] to back
[4173.32 → 4174.08] three times
[4174.08 → 4175.06] in one year.
[4175.42 → 4176.02] Why didn't God
[4176.02 → 4176.68] heal my mom?
[4179.42 → 4180.82] If God is good
[4180.82 → 4182.14] why would he
[4182.14 → 4182.84] let this happen
[4182.84 → 4183.28] to me?
[4185.30 → 4186.14] Remember that quote
[4186.14 → 4187.66] from Allende and Longman?
[4187.98 → 4188.12] Right?
[4188.72 → 4189.86] This reveals
[4189.86 → 4190.68] what our heart
[4190.68 → 4191.38] is doing
[4191.38 → 4192.42] with God.
[4194.32 → 4195.22] And at best
[4195.22 → 4196.84] this way of thinking
[4196.84 → 4197.82] about our struggles
[4197.82 → 4198.62] and our hardships
[4198.62 → 4199.92] turns God
[4199.92 → 4201.20] into a heavenly
[4201.20 → 4201.92] grandparent
[4201.92 → 4202.68] whose job it is
[4202.68 → 4203.52] to spoil us.
[4203.80 → 4204.44] At worst
[4204.44 → 4206.08] it removes God
[4206.08 → 4207.18] as God
[4207.18 → 4208.22] and puts us
[4208.22 → 4209.12] in his place.
[4211.46 → 4211.86] And so
[4211.86 → 4214.40] and here's the
[4214.40 → 4215.14] counselling part
[4215.14 → 4215.96] that comes in.
[4217.40 → 4218.54] How do you know
[4218.54 → 4220.24] when you are doing
[4220.24 → 4221.26] this in your own heart?
[4222.16 → 4223.16] How do you know
[4223.16 → 4223.86] when this is what's
[4223.86 → 4225.32] shaping your mind
[4225.32 → 4225.88] and attitude
[4225.88 → 4226.88] about God?
[4227.30 → 4228.00] And to answer that
[4228.00 → 4229.64] we have to look at
[4229.64 → 4231.06] what comes next.
[4231.28 → 4232.10] So what comes next
[4232.10 → 4232.66] in the psalm
[4232.66 → 4233.86] and what comes next
[4233.86 → 4234.86] in our own lives
[4234.86 → 4235.84] as we're operating
[4235.84 → 4236.62] out of this way
[4236.62 → 4237.08] of seeing
[4237.08 → 4237.94] and being
[4237.94 → 4239.00] in the world.
[4239.26 → 4240.04] So first the psalm.
[4240.70 → 4241.00] Look
[4241.00 → 4242.70] look at verse 7
[4242.70 → 4244.84] in Psalm 77
[4244.84 → 4246.58] and as I read this again
[4246.58 → 4247.76] pay attention
[4247.76 → 4249.36] to the adverbs
[4249.36 → 4252.74] will the Lord
[4252.74 → 4253.56] reject me
[4253.56 → 4255.82] forever?
[4257.82 → 4258.60] Will he
[4258.60 → 4260.02] never
[4260.02 → 4261.54] show his face
[4261.54 → 4261.90] again?
[4262.62 → 4263.16] Has his
[4263.16 → 4264.20] unfailing love
[4264.20 → 4264.82] vanished
[4264.82 → 4266.00] forever?
[4266.14 → 4267.14] Has his promise
[4267.14 → 4267.94] failed
[4267.94 → 4269.02] for all
[4269.02 → 4270.32] time?
[4270.32 → 4274.58] never
[4274.58 → 4276.42] forever
[4276.42 → 4277.82] for all
[4277.82 → 4278.28] time?
[4278.78 → 4279.80] That's the language
[4279.80 → 4281.56] of absolutes.
[4281.56 → 4283.78] when we are
[4283.78 → 4285.28] projecting on God
[4285.28 → 4286.58] a way
[4286.58 → 4288.40] that we believe
[4288.40 → 4289.06] he should be
[4289.06 → 4289.80] operating in the
[4289.80 → 4290.10] world
[4290.10 → 4290.82] and then he
[4290.82 → 4291.52] doesn't do it
[4291.52 → 4292.28] he doesn't act
[4292.28 → 4293.06] according to our
[4293.06 → 4293.38] will
[4293.38 → 4294.88] that disappointment
[4294.88 → 4296.50] has a tendency
[4296.50 → 4298.18] to then exaggerate
[4298.18 → 4299.08] and to draw
[4299.08 → 4300.36] absolute
[4300.36 → 4301.34] conclusions.
[4302.72 → 4303.70] And then
[4303.70 → 4304.80] because they are
[4304.80 → 4305.34] absolute
[4305.34 → 4306.24] by definition
[4306.24 → 4306.68] they are
[4306.68 → 4307.66] unchanging
[4307.66 → 4308.54] and because
[4308.54 → 4309.24] that means
[4309.24 → 4310.34] that this reality
[4310.34 → 4311.08] in front of us
[4311.08 → 4312.32] is impossible
[4312.32 → 4313.20] to change
[4313.20 → 4314.14] we become
[4314.14 → 4314.72] cynical
[4314.72 → 4317.34] and apathetic.
[4318.50 → 4319.38] I want to say
[4319.38 → 4319.76] that again
[4319.76 → 4320.50] because this is
[4320.50 → 4320.92] the line
[4320.92 → 4322.72] when we are
[4322.72 → 4324.04] projecting on God
[4324.04 → 4324.64] a way
[4324.64 → 4326.26] that we believe
[4326.26 → 4326.80] he should be
[4326.80 → 4327.44] operating in the
[4327.44 → 4327.72] world
[4327.72 → 4328.38] and then he
[4328.38 → 4328.92] doesn't do it
[4328.92 → 4329.56] according to our
[4329.56 → 4329.78] will
[4329.78 → 4331.04] we become
[4331.04 → 4331.50] cynical
[4331.50 → 4333.32] and apathetic.
[4335.12 → 4336.44] Now apathy
[4336.44 → 4337.50] and apathetic
[4337.50 → 4338.66] is not caring
[4338.66 → 4340.00] right
[4340.00 → 4341.76] someone
[4341.76 → 4342.58] has said
[4342.58 → 4343.14] that the
[4343.14 → 4343.72] opposite of
[4343.72 → 4344.32] love
[4344.32 → 4345.30] isn't hate
[4345.30 → 4346.84] it's apathy
[4346.84 → 4348.96] right
[4348.96 → 4349.74] and cynical
[4349.74 → 4350.84] and cynicism
[4350.84 → 4352.00] is believing
[4352.00 → 4352.88] that the
[4352.88 → 4353.54] bad that
[4353.54 → 4354.12] is
[4354.12 → 4355.76] is just
[4355.76 → 4356.04] the way
[4356.04 → 4356.54] it is
[4356.54 → 4359.02] but it
[4359.02 → 4359.34] can't be
[4359.34 → 4359.70] changed.
[4361.10 → 4361.68] Now hold
[4361.68 → 4362.26] that same
[4362.26 → 4362.70] lens
[4362.70 → 4363.38] up to
[4363.38 → 4363.96] your own
[4363.96 → 4364.98] life
[4364.98 → 4366.78] first
[4366.78 → 4367.80] as you
[4367.80 → 4368.06] do that
[4368.06 → 4368.32] let me
[4368.32 → 4368.58] say
[4368.58 → 4369.10] that it
[4369.10 → 4369.58] is okay
[4369.58 → 4370.34] to struggle
[4370.34 → 4371.14] and it
[4371.14 → 4371.60] is okay
[4371.60 → 4372.24] to doubt
[4372.24 → 4372.58] and it
[4372.58 → 4373.00] is okay
[4373.00 → 4373.56] to ask
[4373.56 → 4374.48] questions
[4374.48 → 4375.36] it is okay
[4375.36 → 4375.90] to struggle
[4375.90 → 4376.50] with God
[4376.50 → 4376.84] and to
[4376.84 → 4377.28] doubt
[4377.28 → 4377.84] with God
[4377.84 → 4378.14] and to
[4378.14 → 4378.36] ask
[4378.36 → 4378.84] questions
[4378.84 → 4379.54] of God
[4379.54 → 4379.96] I believe
[4379.96 → 4380.54] the Psalms
[4380.54 → 4380.92] make that
[4380.92 → 4381.54] abundantly
[4381.54 → 4381.94] clear
[4381.94 → 4382.44] right
[4382.44 → 4382.98] it's even
[4382.98 → 4383.38] okay
[4383.38 → 4383.76] in the
[4383.76 → 4383.96] midst
[4383.96 → 4384.34] of that
[4384.34 → 4385.16] to feel
[4385.16 → 4385.66] a certain
[4385.66 → 4385.94] measure
[4385.94 → 4386.64] of despair
[4386.64 → 4387.70] as you
[4387.70 → 4387.94] do
[4387.94 → 4390.52] but if
[4390.52 → 4390.76] we are
[4390.76 → 4391.24] operating
[4391.24 → 4391.62] with the
[4391.62 → 4392.22] wrong idea
[4392.22 → 4392.64] of whom
[4392.64 → 4392.94] God
[4392.94 → 4393.36] is
[4393.36 → 4393.62] that
[4393.62 → 4394.16] despair
[4394.16 → 4394.72] will
[4394.72 → 4395.14] quickly
[4395.14 → 4395.72] become
[4395.72 → 4396.54] apathy
[4396.54 → 4398.26] and your
[4398.26 → 4398.72] feelings
[4398.72 → 4399.44] and your
[4399.44 → 4399.90] questions
[4399.90 → 4400.46] of doubt
[4400.46 → 4401.32] and skepticism
[4401.32 → 4402.08] will quickly
[4402.08 → 4402.78] transform
[4402.78 → 4404.40] into cynicism
[4404.40 → 4407.04] apathy
[4407.04 → 4408.22] and cynicism
[4408.22 → 4409.04] are closely
[4409.04 → 4410.34] related together
[4410.34 → 4411.12] and they
[4411.12 → 4411.68] have the
[4411.68 → 4412.46] impact
[4412.46 → 4413.02] in us
[4413.02 → 4414.32] of creating
[4414.32 → 4416.24] or engendering
[4416.24 → 4416.80] a sort of
[4416.80 → 4418.12] under functioning
[4418.12 → 4418.92] response
[4418.92 → 4420.16] to put it
[4420.16 → 4420.56] simply
[4420.56 → 4421.92] apathy
[4421.92 → 4422.80] and cynicism
[4422.80 → 4423.36] mean
[4423.36 → 4424.16] we give
[4424.16 → 4424.50] up
[4424.50 → 4427.18] and so
[4427.18 → 4427.34] now
[4427.34 → 4427.64] look at
[4427.64 → 4427.90] your own
[4427.90 → 4428.20] life
[4428.20 → 4431.38] if your
[4431.38 → 4432.06] default
[4432.06 → 4433.30] when you
[4433.30 → 4433.54] face
[4433.54 → 4434.14] hardships
[4434.14 → 4434.92] when you
[4434.92 → 4435.10] face
[4435.10 → 4435.62] struggles
[4435.62 → 4436.44] or sorrow
[4436.44 → 4437.18] or despair
[4437.18 → 4438.24] is to
[4438.24 → 4438.82] give up
[4438.82 → 4440.22] ask
[4440.22 → 4440.72] yourself
[4440.72 → 4442.18] where are
[4442.18 → 4442.60] apathy
[4442.60 → 4443.22] and cynicism
[4443.22 → 4443.84] showing up
[4443.84 → 4445.26] ask
[4445.26 → 4445.62] yourself
[4445.62 → 4445.80] are
[4445.80 → 4446.60] apathy
[4446.60 → 4447.54] and cynicism
[4447.54 → 4448.06] in my
[4448.06 → 4448.48] heart
[4448.48 → 4449.20] because of
[4449.20 → 4449.54] what I
[4449.54 → 4449.72] am
[4449.72 → 4450.12] really
[4450.12 → 4450.72] genuinely
[4450.72 → 4451.02] what I
[4451.02 → 4451.12] am
[4451.12 → 4452.06] functionally
[4452.06 → 4452.90] believing
[4452.90 → 4453.76] about God
[4453.76 → 4454.12] and who
[4454.12 → 4454.68] God is
[4454.68 → 4456.18] now notice
[4456.18 → 4456.84] the distinction
[4456.84 → 4457.32] I'm making
[4457.32 → 4457.80] there because
[4457.80 → 4458.86] most of us
[4458.86 → 4460.46] here know
[4460.46 → 4461.34] the biblical
[4461.34 → 4461.96] truth about
[4461.96 → 4462.34] who God
[4462.34 → 4462.62] is
[4462.62 → 4464.30] many of us
[4464.30 → 4464.78] here have
[4464.78 → 4465.16] the right
[4465.16 → 4466.10] ideas
[4466.10 → 4467.10] about
[4467.10 → 4467.84] who God
[4467.84 → 4468.14] is
[4468.14 → 4469.90] but we
[4469.90 → 4470.66] live
[4470.66 → 4471.60] out of that
[4471.60 → 4472.10] other way
[4472.10 → 4474.28] we're stuck
[4474.28 → 4475.68] in our
[4475.68 → 4475.88] own
[4475.88 → 4476.42] ideas
[4476.42 → 4477.14] about
[4477.14 → 4477.30] who
[4477.30 → 4477.54] God
[4477.54 → 4477.88] ought
[4477.88 → 4478.10] to
[4478.10 → 4478.42] be
[4478.42 → 4485.40] maybe
[4485.40 → 4485.72] this is
[4485.72 → 4485.94] how you
[4485.94 → 4486.14] need to
[4486.14 → 4486.36] see it
[4486.36 → 4486.70] this morning
[4486.70 → 4489.80] in his
[4489.80 → 4490.14] death on
[4490.14 → 4490.62] the cross
[4490.62 → 4491.56] but also
[4491.56 → 4491.86] in his
[4491.86 → 4492.18] life
[4492.18 → 4493.44] our Lord
[4493.44 → 4493.72] Jesus
[4493.72 → 4494.42] faced
[4494.42 → 4495.48] despair
[4495.48 → 4497.18] he knew
[4497.18 → 4498.30] hardship
[4498.30 → 4500.00] he wept
[4500.00 → 4501.00] and he
[4501.00 → 4501.90] cried out
[4501.90 → 4502.72] to God
[4502.72 → 4503.22] with his
[4503.22 → 4503.66] friends
[4503.66 → 4504.04] and on
[4504.04 → 4504.62] behalf of
[4504.62 → 4504.94] those
[4504.94 → 4505.52] whom he
[4505.52 → 4505.84] loved
[4505.84 → 4506.68] and on
[4506.68 → 4507.28] behalf of
[4507.28 → 4507.78] strangers
[4507.78 → 4508.72] and enemies
[4508.72 → 4509.48] he wept
[4509.48 → 4510.44] for them
[4510.44 → 4511.54] Jesus
[4511.54 → 4512.24] knew
[4512.24 → 4513.10] anguish
[4513.10 → 4514.34] and struggle
[4514.34 → 4515.26] and from
[4515.26 → 4515.96] the cross
[4515.96 → 4516.26] right
[4516.26 → 4516.86] he cried
[4516.86 → 4517.16] out
[4517.16 → 4517.96] my God
[4517.96 → 4518.48] my God
[4518.48 → 4519.20] why have
[4519.20 → 4519.92] you have forsaken
[4519.92 → 4520.24] me
[4520.24 → 4521.68] that's a
[4521.68 → 4522.10] quote from
[4522.10 → 4522.98] Psalm 22
[4522.98 → 4523.76] and it
[4523.76 → 4524.40] sounds pretty
[4524.40 → 4525.12] familiar to
[4525.12 → 4525.46] some of the
[4525.46 → 4525.84] words in
[4525.84 → 4526.50] Psalm 77
[4526.50 → 4527.16] does it
[4527.16 → 4527.38] not
[4527.38 → 4530.74] look I
[4530.74 → 4531.26] love the
[4531.26 → 4532.30] I love the
[4532.30 → 4532.82] way the
[4532.82 → 4533.60] Heidelberg
[4533.60 → 4534.22] Catechism
[4534.22 → 4535.06] summarizes
[4535.06 → 4535.70] this truth
[4535.70 → 4537.10] the Heidelberg
[4537.10 → 4537.58] Catechism
[4537.58 → 4538.02] for those of
[4538.02 → 4538.18] you who
[4538.18 → 4538.56] don't know
[4538.56 → 4538.88] is a
[4538.88 → 4540.42] it's one
[4540.42 → 4540.64] of the
[4540.64 → 4541.30] three forms
[4541.30 → 4541.78] of unity
[4541.78 → 4542.32] it's a
[4542.32 → 4542.68] document
[4542.68 → 4543.20] that our
[4543.20 → 4543.50] church
[4543.50 → 4544.04] tradition
[4544.04 → 4544.50] sort of
[4544.50 → 4545.26] holds up
[4545.26 → 4545.74] as an
[4545.74 → 4546.18] accurate
[4546.18 → 4546.64] and
[4546.64 → 4547.36] succinct
[4547.36 → 4547.90] summary
[4547.90 → 4548.54] of the
[4548.54 → 4548.92] Christian
[4548.92 → 4549.40] faith
[4549.40 → 4550.36] particularly
[4550.36 → 4550.86] in the
[4550.86 → 4551.36] reformed
[4551.36 → 4551.64] tradition
[4551.64 → 4551.92] it was
[4551.92 → 4552.14] written
[4552.14 → 4552.52] in the
[4552.52 → 4553.00] 16th
[4553.00 → 4553.30] century
[4553.30 → 4554.02] and it's
[4554.02 → 4554.30] structured
[4554.30 → 4554.84] in question
[4554.84 → 4555.28] and answer
[4555.28 → 4555.64] some of
[4555.64 → 4555.86] you know
[4555.86 → 4556.08] that
[4556.08 → 4557.88] it has
[4557.88 → 4558.46] a question
[4558.46 → 4559.98] a question
[4559.98 → 4560.26] and answer
[4560.26 → 4560.84] 44
[4560.84 → 4561.34] it says
[4561.34 → 4561.90] what does
[4561.90 → 4562.44] it means
[4562.44 → 4562.96] that Jesus
[4562.96 → 4563.60] descended
[4563.60 → 4564.36] into hell
[4564.36 → 4564.96] which is a
[4564.96 → 4565.36] line from
[4565.36 → 4565.90] the Apostles
[4565.90 → 4566.16] Creed
[4566.16 → 4566.82] and then it
[4566.82 → 4567.28] gives this
[4567.28 → 4567.58] answer
[4567.58 → 4568.08] you can see
[4568.08 → 4569.06] it there
[4569.06 → 4569.90] right
[4569.90 → 4571.50] by suffering
[4571.50 → 4572.66] unspeakable
[4572.66 → 4573.28] anguish
[4573.28 → 4573.72] pain
[4573.72 → 4574.28] and terror
[4574.28 → 4574.86] of soul
[4574.86 → 4575.54] on the cross
[4575.54 → 4576.32] but also
[4576.32 → 4576.72] earlier
[4576.72 → 4577.44] Jesus has
[4577.44 → 4578.10] delivered me
[4578.10 → 4578.78] from hellish
[4578.78 → 4579.54] anguish
[4579.54 → 4580.14] and torment
[4580.14 → 4581.50] and the line
[4581.50 → 4581.84] that I want
[4581.84 → 4582.18] to highlight
[4582.18 → 4582.62] there is
[4582.62 → 4583.76] that unspeakable
[4583.76 → 4584.34] anguish
[4584.34 → 4585.06] pain
[4585.06 → 4586.02] and terror
[4586.02 → 4586.72] of soul
[4586.72 → 4587.44] Jesus
[4587.44 → 4588.32] knew
[4588.32 → 4589.34] anguish
[4589.34 → 4590.06] pain
[4590.06 → 4590.68] and terror
[4590.68 → 4591.14] of soul
[4591.14 → 4591.80] he knew
[4591.80 → 4592.54] despair
[4592.54 → 4593.60] and sorrow
[4593.60 → 4594.92] but he
[4594.92 → 4595.88] never gave
[4595.88 → 4596.28] up
[4596.28 → 4597.64] right
[4597.64 → 4598.14] apathy
[4598.14 → 4599.02] never settled
[4599.02 → 4599.70] in his heart
[4599.70 → 4600.50] cynicism
[4600.50 → 4601.36] never became
[4601.36 → 4601.78] his way
[4601.78 → 4602.14] of seeing
[4602.14 → 4602.52] the world
[4602.52 → 4603.48] can you imagine
[4603.48 → 4604.42] if it had
[4604.42 → 4606.86] can you imagine
[4606.86 → 4607.40] what it would mean
[4607.40 → 4607.70] for us
[4607.70 → 4608.12] if it did
[4608.12 → 4608.28] right
[4608.28 → 4609.28] first
[4609.28 → 4609.90] if it did
[4609.90 → 4610.30] then Jesus
[4610.30 → 4610.80] wouldn't have
[4610.80 → 4611.52] gone to the cross
[4611.52 → 4611.92] he would have
[4611.92 → 4612.38] stepped down
[4612.38 → 4612.70] he would have
[4612.70 → 4613.20] saved himself
[4613.20 → 4613.66] as he was
[4613.66 → 4614.54] tempted to do
[4614.54 → 4614.82] right
[4614.82 → 4615.76] we would still
[4615.76 → 4616.48] be in our
[4616.48 → 4617.40] sin and death
[4617.40 → 4619.22] and if he had
[4619.22 → 4620.06] not gone to the cross
[4620.06 → 4621.04] we would still be
[4621.04 → 4621.84] under our
[4621.84 → 4622.84] punishment for sin
[4622.84 → 4623.68] but perhaps
[4623.68 → 4624.82] even more
[4624.82 → 4625.46] heartbreaking
[4625.46 → 4627.16] is that if he
[4627.16 → 4627.96] didn't see it
[4627.96 → 4628.32] through
[4628.32 → 4629.42] if he did
[4629.42 → 4630.04] give up
[4630.04 → 4630.66] if he let
[4630.66 → 4631.18] apathy
[4631.18 → 4632.12] and cynicism
[4632.12 → 4632.44] win
[4632.44 → 4633.40] that would mean
[4633.40 → 4633.88] that he
[4633.88 → 4634.92] either isn't
[4634.92 → 4635.32] God
[4635.32 → 4637.08] or worse
[4637.08 → 4637.52] yet
[4637.52 → 4638.28] it would mean
[4638.28 → 4638.92] that God
[4638.92 → 4639.46] gives up
[4639.46 → 4642.32] it means
[4642.32 → 4642.72] that God
[4642.72 → 4643.42] lets apathy
[4643.42 → 4644.84] and cynicism
[4644.84 → 4645.16] win
[4645.16 → 4646.56] but I don't
[4646.56 → 4647.12] know about you
[4647.12 → 4648.66] that's just
[4648.66 → 4649.22] not the God
[4649.22 → 4649.66] of the Bible
[4649.66 → 4650.16] I read
[4650.16 → 4651.76] right
[4651.76 → 4652.36] God doesn't
[4652.36 → 4652.68] give up
[4652.68 → 4653.10] he doesn't
[4653.10 → 4653.68] let apathy
[4653.68 → 4654.66] and cynicism
[4654.66 → 4655.22] win
[4655.22 → 4656.50] and if our
[4656.50 → 4657.14] God will
[4657.14 → 4657.86] never give
[4657.86 → 4658.28] up
[4658.28 → 4659.66] maybe
[4659.66 → 4660.86] just maybe
[4660.86 → 4661.34] it means
[4661.34 → 4661.88] neither should
[4661.88 → 4662.14] we
[4662.14 → 4663.94] now you
[4663.94 → 4664.30] might hear
[4664.30 → 4664.52] that
[4664.52 → 4664.92] and I'm
[4664.92 → 4665.44] anticipating
[4665.44 → 4665.64] this
[4665.64 → 4665.90] you might
[4665.90 → 4666.18] hear that
[4666.18 → 4666.34] and you
[4666.34 → 4666.50] say
[4666.50 → 4667.10] but I'm
[4667.10 → 4667.80] not Jesus
[4667.80 → 4669.48] yes and amen
[4669.48 → 4670.16] I know it
[4670.16 → 4671.40] right
[4671.40 → 4672.02] that's absolutely
[4672.02 → 4672.46] true
[4672.46 → 4673.14] you're not
[4673.14 → 4673.68] and that was
[4673.68 → 4674.06] part of our
[4674.06 → 4674.62] point earlier
[4674.62 → 4674.94] right
[4674.94 → 4675.66] that you
[4675.66 → 4675.98] are not
[4675.98 → 4676.22] God
[4676.22 → 4676.46] and we
[4676.46 → 4676.74] cannot
[4676.74 → 4677.34] replace
[4677.34 → 4678.10] God
[4678.10 → 4678.44] with a
[4678.44 → 4678.60] God
[4678.60 → 4678.90] of our
[4678.90 → 4679.42] own
[4679.42 → 4679.76] making
[4679.76 → 4681.44] but
[4681.44 → 4682.50] and this
[4682.50 → 4682.82] is so
[4682.82 → 4683.22] important
[4683.22 → 4683.90] for our
[4683.90 → 4684.40] conversation
[4684.40 → 4684.84] about how
[4684.84 → 4685.24] we handle
[4685.24 → 4685.78] our emotions
[4685.78 → 4686.16] and our
[4686.16 → 4686.54] functioning
[4686.54 → 4687.20] in the
[4687.20 → 4687.46] world
[4687.46 → 4687.98] because in
[4687.98 → 4688.20] a very
[4688.20 → 4688.96] real sense
[4688.96 → 4689.30] in a very
[4689.30 → 4689.70] real
[4689.70 → 4690.22] spiritual
[4690.22 → 4690.76] sense
[4690.76 → 4691.36] in a very
[4691.36 → 4692.02] real sense
[4692.02 → 4692.30] that will
[4692.30 → 4692.78] be affirmed
[4692.78 → 4693.14] for us
[4693.14 → 4693.40] at the
[4693.40 → 4693.74] table
[4693.74 → 4694.40] in a few
[4694.40 → 4694.88] moments
[4694.88 → 4695.36] right
[4695.36 → 4695.70] in a very
[4695.70 → 4696.28] real sense
[4696.28 → 4696.84] you are
[4696.84 → 4697.78] being transformed
[4697.78 → 4698.92] into the
[4698.92 → 4699.46] image
[4699.46 → 4700.36] of Jesus
[4700.36 → 4701.16] you are
[4701.16 → 4701.50] being
[4701.50 → 4702.68] made
[4702.68 → 4703.72] like him
[4703.72 → 4704.26] if you
[4704.26 → 4704.72] believe
[4704.72 → 4705.78] 2nd
[4705.78 → 4706.26] Corinthians
[4706.26 → 4706.94] 3 18
[4706.94 → 4708.12] and we
[4708.12 → 4708.84] all
[4708.84 → 4709.50] who with
[4709.50 → 4710.26] unveiled
[4710.26 → 4710.88] faces
[4710.88 → 4711.66] contemplate
[4711.66 → 4712.18] the Lord's
[4712.18 → 4712.52] glory
[4712.52 → 4713.28] are being
[4713.28 → 4714.08] transformed
[4714.08 → 4715.14] into
[4715.14 → 4716.52] his
[4716.52 → 4717.82] image
[4717.82 → 4718.38] with
[4718.38 → 4718.86] ever
[4718.86 → 4719.86] increasing
[4719.86 → 4720.96] glory
[4720.96 → 4721.94] which comes
[4721.94 → 4723.68] from the
[4723.68 → 4723.98] Lord
[4723.98 → 4724.92] who is
[4724.92 → 4725.38] the Spirit
[4725.38 → 4727.04] we are
[4727.04 → 4727.38] being
[4727.38 → 4728.10] transformed
[4728.10 → 4728.84] into
[4728.84 → 4729.42] his
[4729.42 → 4730.26] image
[4730.26 → 4731.04] the fruit
[4731.04 → 4731.64] of the
[4731.64 → 4732.16] Spirit
[4732.16 → 4733.06] changes
[4733.06 → 4733.52] your
[4733.52 → 4734.08] emotions
[4734.08 → 4734.70] and how
[4734.70 → 4734.92] you
[4734.92 → 4735.38] handle
[4735.38 → 4735.72] them
[4735.72 → 4736.74] and so
[4736.74 → 4737.34] when apathy
[4737.34 → 4738.26] and cynicism
[4738.26 → 4738.90] start to
[4738.90 → 4739.56] creep in
[4739.56 → 4740.34] we need a
[4740.34 → 4740.82] reminder
[4740.82 → 4741.84] of that
[4741.84 → 4742.50] truth
[4742.50 → 4744.12] a reminder
[4744.12 → 4744.74] about whom
[4744.74 → 4745.52] Jesus is
[4745.52 → 4746.24] and what
[4746.24 → 4746.62] he has
[4746.62 → 4746.94] done
[4746.94 → 4748.46] a reminder
[4748.46 → 4749.30] about whom
[4749.30 → 4750.38] Jesus is
[4750.38 → 4750.72] and about
[4750.72 → 4751.26] what Jesus
[4751.26 → 4752.52] has done
[4752.52 → 4752.86] and what
[4752.86 → 4753.60] that means
[4753.60 → 4754.58] for us
[4754.58 → 4755.06] about how
[4755.06 → 4755.86] we function
[4755.86 → 4756.50] in the
[4756.50 → 4756.82] world
[4756.82 → 4757.88] now we
[4757.88 → 4758.20] didn't
[4758.20 → 4759.10] read it
[4759.10 → 4760.78] but look
[4760.78 → 4761.20] again
[4761.20 → 4762.30] at Psalm
[4762.30 → 4763.20] 77
[4763.20 → 4763.84] this time
[4763.84 → 4765.08] verse 13
[4765.08 → 4766.06] to 15
[4766.06 → 4768.88] your ways
[4768.88 → 4769.36] God
[4769.36 → 4770.56] are holy
[4770.56 → 4772.38] what God
[4772.38 → 4772.96] is as great
[4772.96 → 4773.68] as our God
[4773.68 → 4774.64] you are the
[4774.64 → 4775.04] God who
[4775.04 → 4775.84] performs miracles
[4775.84 → 4776.68] you display
[4776.68 → 4777.24] your power
[4777.24 → 4777.70] among the
[4777.70 → 4778.04] peoples
[4778.04 → 4778.74] with your
[4778.74 → 4779.48] mighty arm
[4779.48 → 4780.18] you redeemed
[4780.18 → 4780.72] your people
[4780.72 → 4781.66] the descendants
[4781.66 → 4782.44] of Jacob
[4782.44 → 4783.72] and Joseph
[4783.72 → 4786.28] now this is a
[4786.28 → 4787.30] completely different
[4787.30 → 4788.26] picture of God
[4788.26 → 4789.02] from what Asaph
[4789.02 → 4789.82] spoke just a few
[4789.82 → 4790.62] verses earlier
[4790.62 → 4791.88] in 7 to 9
[4791.88 → 4793.46] right and this
[4793.46 → 4794.24] is the second
[4794.24 → 4794.96] picture
[4794.96 → 4797.10] the second picture
[4797.10 → 4797.82] is the one
[4797.82 → 4798.74] that we need
[4798.74 → 4799.54] to hold on to
[4799.54 → 4801.30] right that God
[4801.30 → 4802.04] is God
[4802.04 → 4802.62] and that he
[4802.62 → 4803.22] is holy
[4803.22 → 4804.22] that somehow
[4804.22 → 4805.66] in some way
[4805.66 → 4807.30] all he does
[4807.30 → 4808.44] is good
[4808.44 → 4809.40] that there is
[4809.40 → 4810.36] no one
[4810.36 → 4811.22] being or
[4811.22 → 4811.86] thing that
[4811.86 → 4812.46] is God
[4812.46 → 4813.06] like him
[4813.06 → 4813.28] that he
[4813.28 → 4814.68] is incomparable
