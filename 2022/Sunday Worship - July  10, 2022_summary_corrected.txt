• Introduction to summer preaching series on parables of Jesus, starting with Matthew 13
• The book "Stories with Intent" by Klein Snodgrass will be used as a resource for studying the parables of Jesus
• Parables are categorized into different types, such as those dealing with lostness, eschatology, money, prayer, and Israel
• The reason Jesus taught in parables is explored, including the idea that it may not be as simple as previous thought
• Two ways people think: propositional thinkers (logic and order) and narrative thinkers (stories and images)
• Parables are intentionally used to confuse those who don't understand, making a theological point through stories from everyday life
• Examples of different thinking styles are given, including the speaker's own children, Malachi and his daughter
• Jesus explains that parables are not just moral lessons, but rather reveal the secrets of the kingdom of heaven to those who understand.
• The true meaning of parables goes beyond surface-level moralism and requires a deeper understanding of the gospel.
• The parable of the Good Samaritan is often misunderstood as simply helping those in need, when its actual lesson is about how the kingdom of God transforms enemies into neighbours.
• Redemption is not just about individual actions, but about being part of a diverse body with Jesus as king.
• The kingdom of heaven has its own economy, which may seem foolish or confusing to outsiders.
• Jesus invites listeners to see past surface-level meanings and understand the deeper mysteries of his parables.
• The tense used in the kingdom parables is present tense, indicating current realities
• Jesus' message about the kingdom's arrival challenges traditional Jewish expectations of a powerful display of God's power and Israel's restoration
• Modern Christians often have similar expectations of what the kingdom should look like, including an absence of pain and evil
• A transactional Christian faith can arise from these expectations, where followers believe they deserve blessings based on their good behaviour or lack of sin
• The consumerist mindset of trying to bend God's will to one's own
• Coercive attempts to force God's hand through prayer or expectations
• Misplaced expectations of what the kingdom of God should look like
• The parable of Jesus in Matthew 13 as a response to these issues
• The lack of extraordinary evidence for the kingdom of God despite Jesus' miracles
• The limitations of human understanding and expectation vs. Jesus' actions
• The concept that even with miracles, it's not enough to overcome human skepticism
• The idea that Jesus is saying that unless one knows or sees him, the gospel won't make sense
• The gradual growth of the kingdom of God from humble beginnings into a global movement
• Stark's book "The Rise of Christianity" estimates around 1,000 Christians in 40 AD
• James Jeffery estimates 2.5 million Jews in Palestine at Jesus' time, making 0.04% become believers
• Christianity grew rapidly to 2 million in the Roman Empire by 200 AD and over 6 million by 300 AD
• The gospel is about Jesus living a life of perfect obedience, dying for sins, being raised from the dead, and ascending to God's right hand as king
• Gospel living is characterized by hope, expectation, rejoicing, and urgency in sharing the message with others
• Despite challenges, Christians have hope that God's mercies are new every morning and that Jesus has overcome the world
