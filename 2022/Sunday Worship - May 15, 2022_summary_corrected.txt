• The church is made up of those who are called, cherished, and kept.
• There are those who seek to divide and destroy this identity in Christ.
• A way to persevere in faith is by remembering, remaining, and rescuing.
• Identity questions are a pervasive issue in today's world, including sexual and gender identity.
• The problem with modern identity language is that it focuses on self-discovery and individuality.
• The gospel offers a permanence of identity based on the absolute permanence of God.
• This gospel identity becomes the foundation for persevering in faith despite challenges.
• The power of God's call carries individuals into His presence and relationship with Him.
• The purpose of worship services is not just to come before God, but for God to pick up those who are weary and heavy-laden and give them rest.
• God's call is not a one-way invitation, but rather He actively picks up and carries individuals into His presence.
• Being called by God means being a chosen people, royal priesthood, holy nation, and special possession of God.
• God cherishes and lavishly loves individuals as His children, created by the One who spoke the world into existence.

• The role of community and the voice of Jesus in shaping one's identity
• The challenge of remembering who one is as a child of God and staying connected with God's love
• The importance of biblical teaching and prayer in building up one's faith
• The Bible teaches that God is love and His love for us is not something we can lose
• We remain in God's love because He keeps us there through His grace
• Neither death nor anything else in creation can separate us from God's love
• Our responsibility is to respond to God's love, not to earn it or keep it
• Responding to God's love means building ourselves up in faith, praying in the Holy Spirit, and waiting for Jesus' return
• The importance of being called, cherished, and kept in one's identity as a Christian
• The need to endure opposition, failure, or loss while staying grounded in faith

• The importance of receiving mercy and forgiveness for past hurts and mistakes
