[666.66 → 667.66] Let me try that again.
[667.66 → 668.66] Good morning.
[668.66 → 669.66] Yes.
[669.66 → 671.66] Malachi is excited.
[671.66 → 677.66] I hope your half is excited to be here and to worship with us together this morning.
[677.66 → 680.66] A special welcome if you're visiting with us or if you're joining us online.
[680.66 → 684.66] We are so excited that you are all here.
[684.66 → 692.66] That video is a reminder of what we did last year at Coldest Night of the Year and an invitation to participate again.
[692.66 → 695.66] You may have seen it in the e-bulletin that went out.
[695.66 → 705.66] If you have any questions about that or what that looks like you can grab me after the service or Nikki Robert who's not here today but when she is back you can talk to her.
[705.66 → 708.66] She will have all sorts of details about that.
[708.66 → 718.66] You can join the team or sponsor a team or whatever and then there will be more details throughout this month as we plan for that event and come together to let that happen.
[718.66 → 728.66] Either virtually, that is in your own neighbourhoods or in other creative ways in WOC to help end and combat homelessness in our city.
[728.66 → 731.66] There are a couple other announcements that we want to put in front of you.
[731.66 → 733.66] One of them is going to come from Wendy.
[733.66 → 736.66] So Wendy, I'm going to invite you to come up to the front.
[736.66 → 745.66] As she's making her way up here, just a reminder for the youth, there is youth coffee following service today and so stick around for that and connect in that way.
[745.66 → 746.66] Go ahead, Wendy.
[746.66 → 747.66] Good morning.
[747.66 → 757.66] Just wondering, I was just really convicted by a verse in Hebrews about let's stir each other up to do loving deeds.
[757.66 → 775.66] And in that spirit, we as a women's fellowship group thought we would like to bless the healthcare workers with granola bars and a tea bag and a note of thanks.
[775.66 → 776.66] And we're collecting them.
[776.66 → 777.66] And we're collecting them.
[777.66 → 785.66] We just encourage each one of you and your kids to bring one or lots, and we'll just fill the bin in the back.
[785.66 → 786.66] It's on the back there.
[786.66 → 788.66] And we would like to deliver it on Valentine's Day.
[788.66 → 800.66] Just to encourage our healthcare workers who are overworked and very tired and exhausted.
[800.66 → 806.66] And just right now, I would like to really show our appreciation to you.
[806.66 → 812.66] I know Amanda is a healthcare worker and I know Larissa Walters and Kim Track.
[812.66 → 822.66] I don't know if there's anyone else who is a healthcare worker, but I would really like for you guys to stand up and let's give them a hand.
[822.66 → 836.66] So we have today and next Sunday to collect them.
[836.66 → 846.66] And if you're in the area during the week, please drop them by in that bin, and we'll deliver them next, on the February 14th.
[846.66 → 853.66] And also, there's a big poster board in the back too on the table if you'd like to just sign that.
[853.66 → 857.66] We're going to get the kids in children's worship time to decorate them.
[857.66 → 868.66] And let's just really pray for the healthcare workers and like from janitors to, you know, to doctors and nurses.
[868.66 → 876.66] Let's just really show our appreciation and love for them. Thanks.
[876.66 → 880.66] Thanks, Wendy, for that and for everyone else who is going to participate in that.
[880.66 → 882.66] Thank you in advance.
[882.66 → 887.66] It's a unique opportunity and a special privilege for us to be able to support those in our community in that way.

[1591.86 → 1593.86] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1593.86 → 1594.86] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1594.86 → 1596.86] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1596.86 → 1597.86] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1597.86 → 1603.86] Oh, precious is the blood of Jesus.
[1603.86 → 1604.86] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1604.86 → 1605.86] Threats me white as snow.
[1605.86 → 1607.86] Threats me white as snow.
[1607.86 → 1611.86] No other fount I know.
[1611.86 → 1615.86] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1615.86 → 1624.30] This is all my hope and peace
[1624.30 → 1628.08] Nothing but the blood of Jesus
[1628.08 → 1632.42] This is all my righteousness
[1632.42 → 1636.90] Nothing but the blood of Jesus
[1636.90 → 1641.66] Oh, precious is the flow
[1641.66 → 1645.90] That makes me white as snow
[1645.90 → 1652.38] No other fount I know
[1652.38 → 1656.30] Nothing but the blood of Jesus
[1656.30 → 1661.10] Oh, precious is the flow
[1661.10 → 1665.62] That makes me white as snow
[1665.62 → 1672.44] No other fount I know
[1672.44 → 1676.58] Nothing but the blood of Jesus
[1676.58 → 1681.52] You may have a seat
[1681.52 → 1706.92] We continue this worship service with the giving of our tithes and offerings.
[1706.92 → 1713.96] This morning's offerings are first for our church's budget and second for Friendship Ministries.
[1713.96 → 1720.20] For decades, Friendship Ministries has worked to promote the ideals of equality, interdependence,
[1720.20 → 1724.28] compassion and hospitality within the body of Christ.
[1724.28 → 1730.54] With a vision for people with and without intellectual disability to grow deeper in their relationship
[1730.54 → 1734.16] with God and with each other in the community together.
[1734.16 → 1740.46] Friendship Ministries has provided resources that support faith formation and congregational inclusion
[1740.46 → 1745.98] with individuals with intellectual disability.
[1745.98 → 1752.10] They believe that faith is a gift from God that does not depend on any level of human intelligence.
[1752.10 → 1757.72] Their program model encourages development of one-on-one personal and meaningful relationships,
[1757.72 → 1759.64] true friendships.
[1759.64 → 1765.94] They strongly believe that all humans are created in the image of God and are created uniquely and equally
[1765.94 → 1768.32] for God's particular purposes.
[1768.32 → 1773.32] They believe that any barriers that impede on this equality are unjust.
[1773.32 → 1776.46] From Colossians 3 verse 12 to 14,
[1776.46 → 1782.76] Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourself with compassion, kindness,
[1782.76 → 1785.76] humility, gentleness and patience.
[1785.76 → 1792.14] Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has any grievance against someone.
[1792.14 → 1794.42] Forgive as the Lord forgave you.
[1794.42 → 1800.38] And over all these virtues, put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity.
[1800.38 → 1802.98] This week's offering is for the Langley Food Bank.
[1802.98 → 1803.56] Please give cheerfully.
[1803.56 → 1805.56] Thank you.
[1805.56 → 1812.64] God bless you.
[1812.86 → 1820.74] God bless you.
[1820.74 → 1824.74] God bless you.
[1824.74 → 1826.74] Amen.
[1854.74 → 1856.74] Amen.
[1884.74 → 1886.74] Amen.
[1914.74 → 1916.74] Amen.
[1944.74 → 1965.06] Amen.
[1968.06 → 1969.60] Hey, kids.
[1969.60 → 1970.96] Come up front.
[1971.10 → 1972.24] I'm ready for you.
[1972.24 → 1978.38] I love you, buddy.
[1983.30 → 1984.64] Oh, my button.
[1985.46 → 1986.62] Your button?
[1990.36 → 1991.62] That's him.
[1992.96 → 1995.06] Hi, everyone.
[1995.60 → 1995.98] Hi.
[1996.66 → 1997.66] How are you doing?
[1997.86 → 1998.18] Good.
[1998.18 → 1999.28] Guess what, Hank?
[1999.44 → 2000.04] What, Hayley?
[2000.46 → 2001.88] I got loose, too.
[2001.88 → 2003.34] You got a loose tooth?
[2003.70 → 2004.60] I got two.
[2004.74 → 2005.72] Those are delicious.
[2007.46 → 2007.90] Two?
[2008.34 → 2011.50] Zoe has a loose tooth, too?
[2011.68 → 2011.92] Yeah.
[2012.12 → 2014.60] I got one in London, Ontario.
[2014.94 → 2018.30] Everybody, put up your hand if you've ever had a loose tooth.
[2018.80 → 2020.42] I've had six.
[2021.86 → 2022.76] All right.
[2023.46 → 2025.16] Should we see how many parents have had one?
[2025.74 → 2029.50] Everybody in the church, put up your hand if you've ever had a loose tooth.
[2031.88 → 2032.50] Wow.
[2033.64 → 2034.92] That's so many.
[2035.22 → 2036.24] Guess what?
[2036.34 → 2039.30] I got two loose teeth here.
[2039.98 → 2040.42] Uh-huh.
[2040.50 → 2041.30] And here.
[2041.50 → 2042.52] And there, too?
[2042.72 → 2043.42] Right here.
[2043.80 → 2044.44] Cool.
[2044.66 → 2045.48] Back in the camera.
[2045.48 → 2046.64] Let's go.
[2046.64 → 2050.30] All right.
[2050.46 → 2053.30] I think we need to talk about something else now.
[2054.26 → 2054.56] One.
[2054.56 → 2054.88] Teddy.
[2054.88 → 2056.50] So Hank wanted...
[2056.50 → 2056.98] Teddy!
[2057.88 → 2058.48] Hi!
[2059.44 → 2060.54] You could be my friend.
[2062.36 → 2062.90] All right.
[2062.96 → 2066.36] Hank wanted to talk to you about something that's very important to him.
[2066.74 → 2068.58] Something that matters a lot to him.
[2068.68 → 2071.20] And it's something that we're going to talk about in children's worship time, too.
[2071.36 → 2072.48] But he has a question for you all.
[2072.52 → 2072.84] That's right.
[2072.90 → 2073.20] Right, Hank?
[2073.44 → 2073.92] I do.
[2074.20 → 2074.50] All right.
[2074.58 → 2074.94] Are you ready?
[2074.94 → 2074.98] Are you ready?
[2076.02 → 2078.94] What is your favourite animal?
[2079.42 → 2079.80] Bunny.
[2080.12 → 2080.52] Bunny.
[2080.74 → 2081.70] The one that's here.
[2081.86 → 2082.16] Bunny.
[2082.16 → 2082.52] Bunny?
[2082.52 → 2084.34] Oh, I love chasing bunnies.
[2084.80 → 2085.38] Bunny.
[2085.64 → 2086.04] Bunny.
[2086.64 → 2087.56] My stuffier.
[2087.90 → 2088.46] Stuffier.
[2089.12 → 2089.54] Yep.
[2090.96 → 2091.52] Cheetah.
[2091.64 → 2092.74] That's like a cat.
[2093.44 → 2094.36] Yeah, Allie.
[2095.18 → 2095.78] Fish.
[2096.50 → 2097.24] Do you have a fish?
[2098.42 → 2099.18] Kitties.
[2099.62 → 2101.30] Why does everyone love cats?
[2101.70 → 2102.06] Kitty.
[2103.00 → 2103.40] Kitty.
[2103.60 → 2103.92] Kitty.
[2104.22 → 2105.32] I have a fish.
[2105.32 → 2105.98] I have a fish.
[2105.98 → 2106.26] Nora.
[2106.78 → 2107.44] I have a fish.
[2107.44 → 2107.86] Pardon me.
[2108.12 → 2108.46] Horses.
[2108.70 → 2109.30] Horses.
[2109.36 → 2110.00] Those are huge.
[2110.18 → 2110.82] I have fish.
[2110.82 → 2111.80] I have fish.
[2111.80 → 2113.06] You have a fish too?
[2113.26 → 2113.94] Fish mouth.
[2114.32 → 2114.62] Yeah?
[2115.12 → 2116.24] Go ahead, Amara.
[2117.28 → 2117.76] Yeah!
[2118.94 → 2119.42] Finally!
[2119.94 → 2121.54] Someone said dog.
[2121.68 → 2122.26] I have a dog.
[2122.36 → 2124.40] Well, why didn't you mention that before?
[2125.46 → 2126.36] Hey, please.
[2126.92 → 2127.64] Yeah, one more.
[2127.98 → 2128.26] Cass?
[2128.26 → 2129.10] I have a dog.
[2129.76 → 2131.48] A dog and two cats?
[2131.96 → 2133.20] Do the dogs chase the cat?
[2134.30 → 2134.78] No?
[2134.94 → 2135.72] What is he doing?
[2135.72 → 2135.80] Good.
[2137.50 → 2142.72] So, we're going to talk about something in children's worship time about...
[2143.58 → 2144.94] Oh, can we talk about that in a second?
[2145.18 → 2145.80] Some sad news?
[2145.92 → 2146.72] Yeah, I'll ask you in one second.
[2146.78 → 2146.92] Okay.
[2147.16 → 2148.40] We're going to talk about some animals.
[2148.50 → 2149.52] Now, here's a question.
[2149.66 → 2152.38] In the wild, how do animals survive?
[2152.96 → 2153.12] Yeah?
[2155.62 → 2156.44] By hunting.
[2157.06 → 2157.34] Okay.
[2157.78 → 2157.96] Yeah?
[2158.96 → 2159.94] Eating each other.
[2160.02 → 2160.86] Yeah, very aggressive.
[2160.86 → 2161.14] Yeah?
[2161.36 → 2166.78] One of them animals are predators, and one of them is the evil one who eats predators.
[2167.06 → 2171.00] So, someone's a predator, and someone eats the predators, and the predators eat some food, too.
[2171.06 → 2171.22] Yeah?
[2171.34 → 2171.50] Yeah?
[2171.64 → 2171.80] Maybe?
[2172.88 → 2178.70] Some animals like koalas go very still on.
[2179.14 → 2180.24] They sure do.
[2181.02 → 2181.58] Yeah, Malachi?
[2182.66 → 2184.54] Cougars can jump over fences.
[2184.54 → 2185.96] Cougars can jump over fences.
[2185.96 → 2187.22] That is very true.
[2187.22 → 2189.60] Now, who provides...
[2189.60 → 2190.92] So, some animals eat other animals.
[2191.02 → 2194.14] Other animals eat things like grass or seeds or things like that, right?
[2194.18 → 2194.60] Is that true?
[2195.16 → 2196.66] That sounds yummy to me.
[2196.76 → 2197.60] I'll eat anything.
[2198.12 → 2198.30] Yeah?
[2206.06 → 2207.44] Don't say that!
[2207.66 → 2209.28] A snake wouldn't eat me!
[2209.28 → 2215.52] So, who do you think provides all the grass and the seeds for these animals to eat?
[2216.30 → 2217.22] God does!
[2217.56 → 2219.62] God takes care of all the animals.
[2220.02 → 2221.04] Now, what does that mean for you?
[2221.12 → 2221.96] Who takes care of you?
[2222.22 → 2222.54] Me!
[2222.84 → 2223.48] You do!
[2223.74 → 2225.12] You take care of you!
[2225.42 → 2226.48] Mom and Dad!
[2226.84 → 2228.50] Mom and Dad take care of you!
[2228.58 → 2230.42] Yeah, who takes care of Mom and Dad?
[2230.94 → 2231.38] God!
[2231.74 → 2232.22] God!
[2232.22 → 2235.96] So, we're going to talk about that a little bit in children's worship time today.
[2236.06 → 2237.34] Yeah, Cass, last thing.
[2239.28 → 2249.02] An anaconda will kill a jaguar if it has to.
[2249.06 → 2249.40] You know what?
[2249.58 → 2254.06] I am very excited for going into the back room and hearing all about these animal facts
[2254.06 → 2255.22] from you in one second, okay?
[2255.48 → 2257.06] But before we do that, let's pray.
[2257.10 → 2257.90] Is that a good idea, Hank?
[2258.62 → 2261.10] Okay, so let's pray, and then we'll go to children's worship time.
[2261.34 → 2261.78] Okay?
[2262.16 → 2264.78] Everybody close your eyes, hold your hands.
[2265.42 → 2266.38] All of your parents, too.
[2266.60 → 2267.06] Good job.
[2267.22 → 2267.56] Let's pray.
[2267.56 → 2269.34] Dear God, thank you for this day.
[2269.42 → 2272.64] Thank you that we could be in church today, and we can learn about how you take care of
[2272.64 → 2273.14] everything.
[2273.26 → 2274.32] You take care of your creation.
[2274.74 → 2276.12] You take care of us, your people.
[2276.24 → 2280.30] And we pray, God, that as we learn more about that today and as people who stay here in the
[2280.30 → 2283.88] sanctuary learn more about you, we just pray that you'll give us open ears and hearts
[2283.88 → 2287.10] to learn what it means to love and follow you and others.
[2287.24 → 2288.12] We pray this in your name.
[2288.46 → 2288.66] Amen.
[2289.08 → 2290.22] Okay, let's do the blessing.
[2290.22 → 2291.12] Everyone stand.
[2295.04 → 2295.54] All right.
[2295.78 → 2296.48] Are you all ready?
[2297.20 → 2297.70] All right.
[2297.78 → 2299.08] So let's face the congregation.
[2299.26 → 2300.96] Put our hands up, and we're going to say the Lord be with you.
[2301.00 → 2302.06] Are you ready at the same time?
[2302.62 → 2304.64] The Lord be with you.
[2306.60 → 2307.56] Say bye, Hank.
[2307.82 → 2308.68] Bye, Hank.
[2308.74 → 2309.36] Bye, everyone.
[2309.36 → 2332.26] Thank you, Hank, for that show this morning.
[2332.46 → 2336.14] It's great to see that the kids are getting more and more comfortable up front of the church,
[2336.22 → 2337.88] so that's also great to see.
[2338.58 → 2339.32] My name's Eric.
[2339.42 → 2343.40] I'm the chair of council, and I just want to let you all know that we had a meeting this
[2343.40 → 2347.14] week, and I'm just going to take this time to give you a little bit of a summary of the
[2347.14 → 2351.58] meeting that we had so you know what we've been talking about and working on.
[2352.64 → 2357.40] First off, we had a report from Brandon Muller about the Mexico trip, and he did a good job
[2357.40 → 2360.60] sharing the vision and what's going to be happening there.
[2360.60 → 2365.60] It seems like everything's good to go, and the leaders, parents, and the kids are all
[2365.60 → 2366.56] excited about this trip.
[2366.56 → 2369.96] So thank you for all those who are putting effort into that.
[2371.22 → 2377.32] Got some reports from Kevin and Pastor Chris as well this week, and all things seem to be
[2377.32 → 2381.68] going well, and they're feeling encouraged by us all here, so that's great news.
[2381.68 → 2395.16] Some of you may be interested in where the capital campaign, the fundraiser is for the new chairs, and it seems like we're about halfway there, so we'll just keep working on that program and see how that goes over the next few months.
[2395.16 → 2416.16] Classes and Synod are, classes for sure is coming up in March, so we have some delegates from our council that are going to be going to that, and the Synod is also coming up this summer, so we put the invite out to anyone who is interested in going to that as well.
[2416.16 → 2432.12] Some other things that are important notes that we want to pass on to you that came up as discussion topics at the meeting is that we wanted to thank you all for all the meeting our church budget and all the expenses from 2021.
[2432.12 → 2449.32] And for 2022 in January, we're a little bit behind, so we're asking that you can get back onto your regular giving habits and continue to contribute to the church here as we have expenses that happen every month, so we're asking that you make that a priority.
[2449.32 → 2466.36] The Safe Church team is asking for everyone who is a volunteer here to make sure your criminal record check process is happening because they need that to be participating in volunteer programs here.
[2466.36 → 2489.64] As well, Sylvie would like us all to know that if you're going to book space in the gym, or in the gym, volleyball coach, if you're going to book space at the church that you make sure you talk to Sylvie in advance to make sure that you can get time in the church because we've had some double bookings happen in the past and that's kind of inconvenient.
[2489.64 → 2496.64] And the last thing was we had a request from Gateway Church.
[2496.64 → 2502.64] There's an Abbotsford disaster relief fund set up for the flood victims in Abbotsford.
[2502.64 → 2509.64] So there's a board being set up, and they're looking for volunteers that would be wanting to participate in that board in terms of dispersing those funds.
[2509.64 → 2513.64] So we're looking for someone from our church that might be interested in that opportunity.
[2513.64 → 2515.64] Thank you.
[2515.64 → 2527.64] Good morning.
[2527.64 → 2528.64] My name is Darrell.
[2528.64 → 2529.64] I'm an elder here at Emmanuel.
[2529.64 → 2532.64] It's my privilege to lead in today's church family prayer.
[2532.64 → 2534.64] Let's go to God in prayer.
[2534.64 → 2538.64] Almighty God, we come to you this morning as your people.
[2538.64 → 2545.64] It is good to praise you, Lord, and make music to your name, to proclaim your love in the morning and your faithfulness at night.
[2545.64 → 2549.64] Thank you for the sunshine today and the beauty of your creation.
[2549.64 → 2555.64] Keep us one in faith and service, breaking bread together and proclaiming the good news to the world.
[2555.64 → 2557.64] Be with the unrest in our world, Lord.
[2557.64 → 2563.64] We think of the tensions in Ukraine and pray for peaceful resolutions to the ongoing conflicts.
[2563.64 → 2571.64] We pray that you direct those in our government and those in authority, that they be guided by your wisdom and not ours and not theirs.
[2571.64 → 2578.64] During these difficult times through an ongoing pandemic, we pray for unity and understanding for one another.
[2578.64 → 2583.64] Help us to seek you first and love one another as we yearn to be loved.
[2583.64 → 2588.64] Be with those in healthcare who are continuing to take care of those dealing with ongoing sickness.
[2588.64 → 2593.64] And please be with those experienced various health concerns or awaiting treatment.
[2593.64 → 2599.64] It is difficult to live in pain and pray that you give them an extra measure of your patience and strength.
[2599.64 → 2604.64] Be with those that are shut in and those dealing with long-term health conditions.
[2604.64 → 2611.64] We also bring to you this morning Matthew and Rachel Skipper as they continue to battle through Rachel's ongoing decline in health.
[2611.64 → 2618.64] As they come to Vancouver this week for additional treatments for Rachel, we pray that she be given healing and further answers for her condition.
[2618.64 → 2627.64] We praise you, Lord, that Jared Alma is settling in well in Costa Rica and pray that he can be your light there and be blessed in his time-serving you.
[2627.64 → 2634.64] We pray for Pastor Chris and his new role for the CRC Search Committee as they look for a new executive director.
[2634.64 → 2636.64] May you guide them in their search.
[2636.64 → 2639.64] Please be also with Pastor Chris as he brings us your word this morning.
[2639.64 → 2643.64] May he be filled with the Spirit and overflowing with your wisdom.
[2643.64 → 2646.64] We also are glad to gather around your table this morning.
[2646.64 → 2652.64] May we come to the table as we are sinful, broken, and in need of your saving grace.
[2652.64 → 2654.64] Thank you for sending your son to save us.
[2654.64 → 2658.64] We pray all these things in Jesus' name. Amen.
[2669.64 → 2682.64] May we come to the table as we are faithful.
[2682.64 → 2690.64] We are going to spend some time together continuing our look in the book of Exodus.
[2690.64 → 2700.64] We are going to read some verses from chapter 12 of Exodus.
[2700.64 → 2704.64] I'm going to invite you to open a Bible and have that in front of you.
[2704.64 → 2707.64] It will be on the screen as we go through.
[2707.64 → 2718.64] But I do think it's important to have that there as we reflect on what God is saying to us together this morning.
[2718.64 → 2734.64] As I was thinking about this service and about the content of very familiar passages in Scripture and really well-known stories to many of us,
[2734.64 → 2741.64] I was struck again by the question, why are we here?
[2741.64 → 2748.64] What is the purpose of this regular rhythm of gathering in worship of our God?
[2748.64 → 2753.64] Why do we come together, and why do we make much of opening the Bible?
[2753.64 → 2757.64] Why does it matter that we come to the table? What is going on?
[2757.64 → 2764.64] Is there something more than just the actions of coming to this place?
[2764.64 → 2775.64] And it's in that context and in that question that I want us to sit as we come to this very familiar text and story in Exodus 12.
[2775.64 → 2783.64] I'm going to read the first 16 verses of Exodus 12, and then I'll jump to the end to get the last two verses of that.
[2783.64 → 2787.64] Let's read.
[2787.64 → 2790.64] The Lord said to Moses and Aaron in Egypt,
[2790.64 → 2797.64] This month is to be for you the first month, the first month of your year.
[2797.64 → 2806.64] Tell the whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month, each man is to take a lamb for his family, one for each household.
[2806.64 → 2815.64] If any household is too small for a whole lamb, they must share one with their nearest neighbour, having taken into account the number of people they are.
[2815.64 → 2822.64] You are to determine the amount of lamb needed in accordance with what each person will eat.
[2822.64 → 2830.64] The animals you choose must be year old males without defect, and you may take them from the sheep or the goats.
[2830.64 → 2838.64] Take care of them until the fourteenth day of the month, when all the members of the community of Israel must slaughter them at twilight.
[2838.64 → 2845.64] Then they are to take some of the blood and put it on the sides and tops of the door frames of the houses where they eat the lamb.
[2845.64 → 2854.64] That same night they are to eat the meat roasted over the fire along with bitter herbs and bread made without yeast.
[2854.64 → 2862.64] Do not eat the meat raw or boiled in water, but roast it over a fire with the head, the legs and the internal organs.
[2862.64 → 2865.64] Do not leave any of it till morning.
[2865.64 → 2869.64] If some is left till morning, you must burn it.
[2869.64 → 2871.64] This is how you are to eat it.
[2871.64 → 2878.64] With your cloak tucked into your belt and your sandals on your feet and your staff in your hand, eat it in haste.
[2878.64 → 2880.64] It is the Lord's Passover.
[2881.64 → 2887.64] On the same night I will pass through Egypt and strike down every firstborn of both people and animals,
[2887.64 → 2891.64] and I will bring judgment on all the gods of Egypt.
[2891.64 → 2894.64] I am the Lord.
[2894.64 → 2898.64] The blood will be assigned for you on the houses where you are,
[2898.64 → 2901.64] and when I see the blood, I will pass over you.
[2901.64 → 2906.64] No destructive plague will touch you when I strike Egypt.
[2906.64 → 2909.64] This is a day that you are to commemorate.
[2909.64 → 2915.64] For generations to come, you shall celebrate it as a festival to the Lord, a lasting ordinance.
[2915.64 → 2919.64] For seven days you are to eat bread made without yeast.
[2919.64 → 2921.64] On the first day, remove the yeast from your houses,
[2921.64 → 2927.64] for whoever eats anything with yeast in it from the first day through the seventh must be cut off from Israel.
[2927.64 → 2933.64] On the first day, hold a sacred assembly, and another one on the seventh.
[2933.64 → 2938.64] Do no work at all on these days except to prepare food for everyone to eat.
[2938.64 → 2940.64] That is all you may do.
[2940.64 → 2944.64] And then jumping to verse 29.
[2944.64 → 2950.64] At midnight, the Lord struck down all the firstborn in Egypt.
[2950.64 → 2955.64] From the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on the throne to the firstborn of the prisoner who was in the dungeon,
[2955.64 → 2958.64] and the firstborn of all the livestock as well.
[2958.64 → 2963.64] Pharaoh and all his officials and all the Egyptians got up during the night,
[2963.64 → 2965.64] and there was loud wailing in Egypt,
[2965.64 → 2970.64] for there was not a house without someone dead.
[2970.64 → 2975.64] This is the word of the Lord.
[2975.64 → 2980.64] Now I want to acknowledge that there are times when we read scripture,
[2980.64 → 2983.64] and I say, this is the word of the Lord,
[2983.64 → 2991.64] and your somewhat intuitive or unthought response, thanks be to God, sounds a little strange.
[2991.64 → 2995.64] This is one of those times.
[2995.64 → 3001.64] For there was not a house without someone dead, thanks be to God.
[3001.64 → 3003.64] This is a weird story.
[3003.64 → 3007.64] And it's weird, not just because of things like that,
[3007.64 → 3014.64] but because we have been in this really intense and fast-paced drama, right,
[3014.64 → 3018.64] in the plagues moving from catastrophe to catastrophe.
[3018.64 → 3023.64] And then we didn't read it, but chapter 11 recounts the plague of the firstborn
[3023.64 → 3025.64] and how it will come through.
[3025.64 → 3027.64] And then here we end with it taking place.
[3027.64 → 3037.64] But in the middle, in the first 28 or so verses of chapter 12, there's this stop.
[3037.64 → 3042.64] It's like we've been rushing towards something only to just put a full stop,
[3042.64 → 3048.64] and we get these instructions for the Passover and for the festival of the unleavened bread.
[3048.64 → 3052.64] Now it's a fair question to ask at this moment, right?
[3052.64 → 3060.64] Why on earth would you stop this sort of emergency planning and emergency level narrative story
[3060.64 → 3063.64] to give liturgical instructions?
[3065.64 → 3066.64] Why would you stop?
[3066.64 → 3072.64] Why would the author stop to make this particular point?
[3072.64 → 3082.64] Now I think it's the answer to that question that's a good way into this text for us this morning.
[3082.64 → 3086.64] Because you see, I want to suggest to you that the point of this celebration,
[3086.64 → 3091.64] the point of the elaborate details of its record and its institution
[3091.64 → 3097.64] and how it is to be practiced isn't at the moment immediately for Moses
[3097.64 → 3101.64] or for the Israelites who are there waiting to go.
[3102.64 → 3105.86] But it is for the benefit of the people to come.
[3106.58 → 3109.26] For the benefit of future generations.
[3110.88 → 3111.04] Right?
[3111.14 → 3117.82] This kind of God's-eyed view of what is taking place is hinted at throughout the story of the plagues.
[3117.82 → 3124.08] If you remember where we looked last time, or if you've been reading this week, as I encourage you to do,
[3124.44 → 3127.78] in chapter 10, the Lord tells Moses,
[3127.78 → 3135.88] Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the hearts of his officials, so that I may perform these miraculous signs of mine among them,
[3136.14 → 3144.06] that you may tell your children and your grandchildren how I dealt harshly with the Egyptians,
[3144.20 → 3149.82] and how I performed these many signs among them, that you may know that I am the Lord.
[3149.82 → 3158.12] Chapter 12 and chapter 13 to follow are full of references of telling children and grandchildren,
[3158.34 → 3163.72] of passing on this moment in time as a matter of covenant identity.
[3164.18 → 3171.02] God's work in the world through the plagues, and now, most pointedly, in this, the tenth plague, the final plague,
[3171.02 → 3180.54] and in the Passover connected to it, are always, and have always been, acts intended to sort of transcend space and time.
[3180.90 → 3185.38] They're acts that define more than just the people who participated in them the first time around.
[3186.80 → 3191.72] They're acts that define an entire people, past, present, and future.
[3191.94 → 3195.00] This, here, is a defining moment.
[3195.00 → 3197.88] It is an identity moment for the Hebrews.
[3198.68 → 3202.48] And that's made all the more clear by the line from verse 2.
[3204.88 → 3206.12] The Lord says to Moses and Aaron,
[3206.38 → 3209.94] This is to be for you the first month.
[3210.62 → 3213.56] The first month of your year.
[3215.28 → 3218.40] God is redefining the calendar at this moment.
[3218.40 → 3224.40] Now, it's very likely that the Hebrews, because of their 430-odd years in Egypt,
[3224.52 → 3228.56] have adopted the Egyptian calendar frame,
[3228.66 → 3231.62] and so this is where we get something new from God.
[3232.32 → 3237.22] And the Exodus is to mark a new beginning for these people.
[3237.62 → 3241.58] The Passover is the experience of that new beginning.
[3241.58 → 3246.34] In the Hebrew calendar, the month is called Bib or Aviv,
[3246.76 → 3249.62] depending on how you want to pronounce continental vowels.
[3250.18 → 3252.64] And in Aramaic, it's called Nissan,
[3253.28 → 3257.58] and it occurs during the spring solstice.
[3257.68 → 3258.10] There it is.
[3258.92 → 3263.38] During the spring solstice, which is sometime in our April or March.
[3263.38 → 3269.50] Every glance at the calendar from this moment forward
[3269.50 → 3273.78] will remind the Israelites of this defining event.
[3275.12 → 3280.06] And just like the plagues were a callback to the power of God over the chaoses,
[3280.62 → 3284.32] or where did we read it?
[3284.38 → 3288.06] That he has defeated the gods of Egypt.
[3288.50 → 3291.52] He's brought judgment on all the gods of Egypt in verse 12.
[3291.52 → 3294.34] Just like we've seen that in the plagues,
[3294.76 → 3298.76] and just like God unleashing the chaoses of creation in that
[3298.76 → 3301.52] is a callback to the creation story,
[3301.62 → 3304.36] where God orders the chaoses of the world,
[3304.44 → 3305.42] where he puts order in it.
[3305.46 → 3307.86] Just like at the very beginning of this series,
[3307.98 → 3310.12] we looked at the Israelites, and they were fruitful,
[3310.36 → 3313.20] and they multiplied under the rule of Pharaoh.
[3313.38 → 3317.32] Just like that is a callback to the creation story of God's people.
[3317.72 → 3320.60] This event here, being the beginning of the year,
[3320.60 → 3321.86] being a new thing for them,
[3321.86 → 3324.74] is a new creation identity.
[3325.06 → 3326.56] It's a reprinstonating.
[3326.88 → 3328.64] They are starting over.
[3329.84 → 3333.00] And it's to underscore and to prioritize
[3333.00 → 3336.52] this new creation identity,
[3336.80 → 3339.98] this theological reality for the people
[3339.98 → 3343.52] that makes sense of how you can have
[3343.52 → 3346.04] this really fast-paced story stop
[3346.04 → 3348.34] for liturgical instruction.
[3349.98 → 3350.58] Right?
[3350.62 → 3352.58] It is to underscore and prioritize
[3352.58 → 3354.88] this new theological identity
[3354.88 → 3360.06] that makes sense of this moment of liturgical interlude.
[3360.06 → 3364.28] I want you to hang on to that idea in your mind.
[3365.94 → 3367.66] Expressly park it for a moment,
[3367.74 → 3369.32] because I'm going to return to it in force
[3369.32 → 3371.34] at the end when we tie it all together.
[3372.34 → 3373.62] And so with that background,
[3374.00 → 3377.10] let's look at the Passover festival.
[3377.10 → 3381.38] Now from this time forward,
[3382.06 → 3383.24] at the same time,
[3383.32 → 3384.00] every year,
[3384.94 → 3386.24] the first month of the year,
[3387.02 → 3387.20] right,
[3387.28 → 3388.90] each household is to take
[3388.90 → 3390.74] a year-old male lamb
[3390.74 → 3392.40] without defect.
[3393.36 → 3394.72] And if the house is too small
[3394.72 → 3396.02] to consume the entire thing,
[3396.20 → 3398.30] it's to be shared among other smaller houses,
[3398.44 → 3398.60] right,
[3398.62 → 3399.70] to invite the neighbours over.
[3399.70 → 3402.00] And that blood from the lamb
[3402.00 → 3403.22] is to be collected
[3403.22 → 3405.18] and drained into a basin.
[3405.76 → 3407.20] And then a branch of hyssop
[3407.20 → 3408.52] will be collected
[3408.52 → 3411.24] and it will be dipped into that blood
[3411.24 → 3412.62] and the tops and sides
[3412.62 → 3413.78] of all the door frames
[3413.78 → 3415.60] and all the houses participating
[3415.60 → 3417.36] will be painted with that blood.
[3417.46 → 3419.34] And that blood will be a sign
[3419.34 → 3421.90] that these people have taken refuge
[3421.90 → 3424.34] under God's protection
[3424.34 → 3425.84] and that they, therefore,
[3426.02 → 3428.24] will be passed over
[3428.24 → 3432.34] by the angel of death
[3432.34 → 3433.04] that moves through.
[3433.36 → 3435.08] That's why this is called Passover.
[3436.22 → 3437.64] And the meat from that lamb
[3437.64 → 3439.08] is then gathered,
[3439.32 → 3439.60] roasted,
[3439.90 → 3441.32] and eaten with bitter herbs
[3441.32 → 3442.52] and they are to eat bread
[3442.52 → 3444.30] that is made without yeast.
[3445.16 → 3445.62] In short,
[3445.74 → 3446.46] it's a meal
[3446.46 → 3447.42] that they're supposed to be able
[3447.42 → 3448.36] to prepare
[3448.36 → 3450.04] and take in quickly,
[3450.20 → 3450.98] in haste,
[3451.08 → 3452.68] and eaten on the road
[3452.68 → 3453.44] if necessary.
[3455.50 → 3456.40] As we said,
[3456.52 → 3457.68] this section
[3457.68 → 3458.94] of Exodus
[3458.94 → 3461.18] is not just about
[3461.18 → 3463.20] the rules for Passover.
[3463.42 → 3464.60] This celebration
[3464.60 → 3465.56] is intended
[3465.56 → 3467.00] to be a lasting
[3467.00 → 3468.16] ordinance
[3468.16 → 3469.52] used by parents
[3469.52 → 3471.04] to teach children
[3471.04 → 3472.06] the faithfulness
[3472.06 → 3472.96] of God.
[3473.54 → 3474.62] In looking back
[3474.62 → 3475.96] on this Passover meal
[3475.96 → 3476.94] and practicing it
[3476.94 → 3478.38] with your household
[3478.38 → 3479.72] and with your neighbours,
[3480.02 → 3480.94] future generations
[3480.94 → 3482.80] are not only reminded
[3482.80 → 3484.18] of what God has done,
[3484.32 → 3485.18] but future generations
[3485.18 → 3486.64] are also invited
[3486.64 → 3487.28] and encouraged
[3487.28 → 3488.10] to look forward
[3488.10 → 3489.48] to what God will do
[3489.48 → 3490.64] and to look around
[3490.64 → 3491.72] to see what God
[3491.72 → 3492.52] is doing.
[3495.26 → 3496.84] In the Mishnah,
[3497.50 → 3498.72] which is a collection
[3498.72 → 3501.20] of Jewish rabbinical
[3501.20 → 3501.96] sayings
[3501.96 → 3505.10] from the post-exilic period,
[3505.10 → 3507.26] so around the time
[3507.26 → 3507.66] of Jesus
[3507.66 → 3508.54] and a few hundred
[3508.54 → 3509.16] years before
[3509.16 → 3509.98] and after.
[3510.12 → 3510.46] The Mishnah
[3510.46 → 3510.96] is a collection
[3510.96 → 3511.60] of documents
[3511.60 → 3512.64] and sayings
[3512.64 → 3513.36] from rabbis
[3513.36 → 3514.84] and one rabbi
[3514.84 → 3515.52] in particular
[3515.52 → 3516.06] says,
[3516.16 → 3517.16] Rabbi Passim
[3517.16 → 3517.80] says,
[3517.80 → 3519.58] in every generation
[3519.58 → 3521.20] a man must so
[3521.20 → 3522.18] regard himself
[3522.18 → 3523.32] as if he came
[3523.32 → 3524.38] forth himself
[3524.38 → 3525.46] out of Egypt.
[3526.42 → 3527.12] But the Passover
[3527.12 → 3529.26] is a theological
[3529.26 → 3530.20] identity,
[3530.52 → 3531.50] the exodus
[3531.50 → 3532.54] and the Passover
[3532.54 → 3533.58] is a theological
[3533.58 → 3534.20] identity
[3534.20 → 3535.68] for all Jewish people,
[3535.82 → 3536.76] whether they were there
[3536.76 → 3538.20] or they were born
[3538.20 → 3539.00] a thousand years later.
[3540.68 → 3541.96] But what's interesting,
[3542.54 → 3544.20] if you take your Bible
[3544.20 → 3545.26] and scan through
[3545.26 → 3546.18] and do a bit
[3546.18 → 3547.10] of a study here,
[3547.68 → 3548.18] if you trace
[3548.18 → 3548.80] the history
[3548.80 → 3550.16] of Israel forward,
[3550.70 → 3551.54] you will find
[3551.54 → 3552.56] a few times
[3552.56 → 3553.18] where the Passover
[3553.18 → 3554.22] is being practiced
[3554.22 → 3556.30] but many more times
[3556.30 → 3556.92] where it's not.
[3558.34 → 3558.76] And so during
[3558.76 → 3559.40] the 40 years
[3559.40 → 3560.02] of wandering,
[3560.50 → 3560.78] Passover
[3560.78 → 3561.56] isn't celebrated.
[3562.64 → 3563.64] It starts again,
[3563.72 → 3564.42] it happens again
[3564.42 → 3565.24] for a short period
[3565.24 → 3565.66] of time
[3565.66 → 3566.88] when the people
[3566.88 → 3567.84] cross the Jordan
[3567.84 → 3568.82] into the land
[3568.82 → 3569.96] for the first time
[3569.96 → 3572.36] but as judges
[3572.36 → 3572.92] happen
[3572.92 → 3573.92] and each man
[3573.92 → 3574.94] does what is right
[3574.94 → 3575.78] in his own eyes
[3575.78 → 3576.48] as the rule
[3576.48 → 3577.12] of the kings
[3577.12 → 3578.02] takes over
[3578.02 → 3578.84] in that place
[3578.84 → 3579.54] where actually
[3579.54 → 3580.12] the practice
[3580.12 → 3580.66] of Passover
[3580.66 → 3581.48] falls away.
[3581.70 → 3582.44] We're only told
[3582.44 → 3583.30] explicitly that
[3583.30 → 3583.96] Josiah,
[3584.28 → 3584.96] King Josiah
[3584.96 → 3586.68] restores the practice
[3586.68 → 3587.84] of Passover
[3587.84 → 3589.86] and then it doesn't
[3589.86 → 3590.64] happen again
[3590.64 → 3591.42] with any sort
[3591.42 → 3592.10] of regularity
[3592.10 → 3592.86] until after
[3592.86 → 3594.08] the Babylonian exile
[3594.08 → 3594.80] sometime
[3594.80 → 3596.76] in the 6th century
[3596.76 → 3597.48] BC.
[3598.48 → 3599.74] And so for about
[3599.74 → 3600.76] a thousand years
[3600.76 → 3601.70] after this day
[3601.70 → 3602.40] in Egypt,
[3602.82 → 3603.38] the Passover
[3603.38 → 3604.76] might not have been
[3604.76 → 3606.14] an actual regular
[3606.14 → 3607.68] event for every
[3607.68 → 3608.24] generation
[3608.24 → 3609.92] and yet it's given
[3609.92 → 3611.42] as a defining one,
[3611.54 → 3613.12] an identity defining
[3613.12 → 3613.50] one.
[3614.46 → 3615.24] And with all the
[3615.24 → 3616.50] twists and turns
[3616.50 → 3617.84] of her history,
[3618.40 → 3619.14] the Passover
[3619.14 → 3620.56] occurs at a few
[3620.56 → 3621.58] significant stages
[3621.58 → 3623.46] in Israel's history
[3623.46 → 3624.06] and formation
[3624.06 → 3624.96] and in their practice
[3624.96 → 3625.96] absolutely, right?
[3626.02 → 3626.64] From Egypt
[3626.64 → 3627.56] and to Canaan
[3627.56 → 3628.72] and from exile
[3628.72 → 3629.48] and then back.
[3629.48 → 3631.60] And through it all
[3631.60 → 3632.86] when they remember
[3632.86 → 3633.74] who they are,
[3633.82 → 3635.10] when they come back
[3635.10 → 3636.18] to obedience,
[3636.54 → 3637.88] they see this
[3637.88 → 3639.06] as the defining
[3639.06 → 3641.12] feature of Israel's
[3641.12 → 3641.78] relationship
[3641.78 → 3642.70] to God.
[3643.84 → 3644.88] Now throughout
[3644.88 → 3646.12] each practice,
[3647.10 → 3648.28] the Passover lamb
[3648.28 → 3649.54] is a reminder
[3649.54 → 3651.68] that Israel's
[3651.68 → 3652.32] life
[3652.32 → 3653.52] came
[3653.52 → 3654.64] from death.
[3655.70 → 3656.56] Now you see that
[3656.56 → 3657.18] not only in the
[3657.18 → 3657.86] 10th plague,
[3658.18 → 3658.36] right?
[3658.36 → 3659.08] A 10th plague
[3659.08 → 3659.88] where the Egyptian
[3659.88 → 3660.90] firstborn are killed
[3660.90 → 3662.20] and we see that
[3662.20 → 3663.68] not only as a response
[3663.68 → 3665.72] to before
[3665.72 → 3666.72] when Pharaoh
[3666.72 → 3667.56] killed all the
[3667.56 → 3669.22] Israelite children
[3669.22 → 3670.48] or Israelite boys,
[3671.58 → 3671.78] right?
[3671.94 → 3673.68] This is also God
[3673.68 → 3675.28] and this is in other
[3675.28 → 3676.22] places where this story
[3676.22 → 3677.00] is going to sound weird
[3677.00 → 3677.92] to our modern ears,
[3678.40 → 3680.12] exercises his right
[3680.12 → 3681.32] over the firstborn.
[3682.84 → 3682.96] Right?
[3683.00 → 3683.56] So the Passover
[3683.56 → 3684.70] isn't simply
[3684.70 → 3686.04] a matter of the lamb
[3686.04 → 3687.10] replacing the
[3687.10 → 3688.10] Israelites' firstborn.
[3688.10 → 3689.22] It's God
[3689.22 → 3690.44] purchasing the
[3690.44 → 3690.88] redemption
[3690.88 → 3692.10] of his son
[3692.10 → 3692.94] Israel
[3692.94 → 3694.12] through the
[3694.12 → 3695.22] death of the
[3695.22 → 3695.70] Egyptian
[3695.70 → 3697.02] firstborns.
[3697.42 → 3698.36] Now like I said,
[3698.42 → 3699.02] in our culture
[3699.02 → 3700.78] that sounds strange
[3700.78 → 3701.92] and that sounds weird,
[3702.16 → 3702.72] maybe it sounds
[3702.72 → 3703.26] arbitrary,
[3703.44 → 3703.86] maybe it even
[3703.86 → 3704.48] sounds abusive.
[3706.22 → 3707.18] But it actually
[3707.18 → 3707.90] wasn't that long
[3707.90 → 3708.82] ago where
[3708.82 → 3710.50] ideas about
[3710.50 → 3711.24] being the
[3711.24 → 3712.38] firstborn son
[3712.38 → 3713.08] determined
[3713.08 → 3714.04] your whole life.
[3714.04 → 3715.38] in fact,
[3715.38 → 3715.88] there are still
[3715.88 → 3716.82] monarchies in the
[3716.82 → 3717.32] world, right,
[3717.36 → 3717.80] where that is
[3717.80 → 3718.46] true.
[3718.82 → 3720.10] A modern monarchy
[3720.10 → 3721.14] says, well it can be
[3721.14 → 3721.98] a son or a daughter,
[3722.10 → 3722.92] but firstborn still
[3722.92 → 3723.28] matters.
[3726.16 → 3726.64] Throughout
[3726.64 → 3728.60] the entire drama
[3728.60 → 3729.56] of scripture
[3729.56 → 3730.48] and in the ancient
[3730.48 → 3731.42] near eastern world,
[3732.30 → 3733.22] this is common
[3733.22 → 3733.82] and normal,
[3734.14 → 3734.88] but in the Bible
[3734.88 → 3735.24] too,
[3735.32 → 3736.58] you see God's
[3736.58 → 3737.86] right to the
[3737.86 → 3738.60] firstborn
[3738.60 → 3739.80] as recognized,
[3740.36 → 3740.54] right,
[3740.54 → 3741.10] with Abraham
[3741.10 → 3742.16] and Isaac,
[3742.80 → 3743.72] with Moses'
[3743.98 → 3744.52] son being
[3744.52 → 3745.38] required to
[3745.38 → 3746.64] be circumcised,
[3746.74 → 3747.06] with the
[3747.06 → 3747.94] repetitive
[3747.94 → 3749.18] consecration
[3749.18 → 3749.82] of the
[3749.82 → 3750.52] firstborn
[3750.52 → 3751.54] to priestly
[3751.54 → 3752.40] service in
[3752.40 → 3752.76] Israel,
[3752.86 → 3753.32] they're all
[3753.32 → 3754.40] indicative of
[3754.40 → 3755.32] God's right
[3755.32 → 3755.78] to the
[3755.78 → 3756.52] firstborn.
[3756.74 → 3757.26] The departure
[3757.26 → 3757.94] from Egypt
[3757.94 → 3758.94] then will not
[3758.94 → 3759.58] be without
[3759.58 → 3760.20] a price.
[3761.92 → 3762.38] A blood
[3762.38 → 3763.28] sacrifice will
[3763.28 → 3763.80] have to be
[3763.80 → 3764.08] made.
[3765.76 → 3766.22] This is the
[3766.22 → 3767.62] pattern of
[3767.62 → 3768.00] redemption.
[3768.00 → 3770.38] And while it
[3770.38 → 3770.90] may seem
[3770.90 → 3771.52] strange to
[3771.52 → 3771.84] us,
[3771.94 → 3772.48] the requirement
[3772.48 → 3773.30] for blood
[3773.30 → 3773.88] or death,
[3774.20 → 3775.28] it does kind
[3775.28 → 3776.18] of make sense
[3776.18 → 3777.20] in light of
[3777.20 → 3777.76] the broader
[3777.76 → 3778.46] narrative of
[3778.46 → 3778.94] the plagues.
[3779.94 → 3780.14] Right?
[3780.20 → 3780.42] Remember,
[3780.58 → 3780.82] in our
[3780.82 → 3781.46] discussion of
[3781.46 → 3781.82] the plague
[3781.82 → 3782.12] narrative,
[3782.26 → 3782.82] we have seen
[3782.82 → 3783.82] how this is
[3783.82 → 3784.92] representative of
[3784.92 → 3785.42] that great
[3785.42 → 3786.58] cosmic battle
[3786.58 → 3787.88] between light
[3787.88 → 3788.70] and darkness,
[3788.84 → 3789.52] between God
[3789.52 → 3790.24] and Satan,
[3790.42 → 3791.02] between God
[3791.02 → 3792.08] and the gods
[3792.08 → 3792.78] of Egypt,
[3792.96 → 3793.50] between good
[3793.50 → 3794.34] and evil,
[3794.44 → 3794.94] and for almost
[3794.94 → 3795.90] every plague,
[3796.02 → 3796.54] we have seen
[3796.54 → 3797.68] how God is
[3797.68 → 3798.70] unleashing the
[3798.70 → 3799.82] chaos and
[3799.82 → 3800.76] the disorder
[3800.76 → 3802.18] of creation.
[3802.74 → 3802.82] Right?
[3802.82 → 3803.46] That the powers
[3803.46 → 3804.04] of darkness
[3804.04 → 3804.42] that God
[3804.42 → 3805.32] regularly holds
[3805.32 → 3805.90] at bay,
[3806.08 → 3806.94] he lets go
[3806.94 → 3807.88] and unleashes
[3807.88 → 3808.58] in the plagues.
[3809.70 → 3810.20] And what is
[3810.20 → 3810.84] the greatest
[3810.84 → 3812.24] power of
[3812.24 → 3812.68] darkness?
[3815.40 → 3816.18] Already back
[3816.18 → 3816.74] in the story
[3816.74 → 3817.48] of Adam and
[3817.48 → 3817.76] Eve,
[3817.84 → 3818.28] we're told the
[3818.28 → 3818.76] answer to this
[3818.76 → 3819.06] question.
[3820.10 → 3820.92] The answer is
[3820.92 → 3821.28] death.
[3822.56 → 3822.76] Right?
[3822.80 → 3823.58] After placing
[3823.58 → 3824.22] Adam and Eve
[3824.22 → 3824.82] in the garden,
[3825.02 → 3825.66] God tells them,
[3825.66 → 3826.66] you are free
[3826.66 → 3827.22] to eat of
[3827.22 → 3827.82] any tree
[3827.82 → 3828.42] of the garden,
[3828.52 → 3829.12] but you must
[3829.12 → 3829.68] not eat
[3829.68 → 3830.20] from the tree
[3830.20 → 3830.76] of knowledge
[3830.76 → 3831.16] of good
[3831.16 → 3831.54] and evil,
[3831.64 → 3832.48] for if you
[3832.48 → 3833.04] eat from it,
[3833.10 → 3833.50] you will
[3833.50 → 3835.12] surely die.
[3836.38 → 3836.78] And again,
[3837.06 → 3837.92] after Adam and
[3837.92 → 3838.56] Eve eat from
[3838.56 → 3838.90] the tree,
[3839.02 → 3839.68] God says to
[3839.68 → 3839.92] them,
[3840.08 → 3840.72] from dust
[3840.72 → 3841.44] you are,
[3841.56 → 3842.40] and to dust
[3842.40 → 3843.26] you will
[3843.26 → 3843.70] return.
[3844.80 → 3845.64] Death is
[3845.64 → 3846.54] the great
[3846.54 → 3847.18] enemy,
[3847.40 → 3847.98] death is
[3847.98 → 3848.70] the epitome
[3848.70 → 3850.04] of creation.
[3851.80 → 3852.24] And yet,
[3852.24 → 3853.64] even after
[3853.64 → 3854.08] sinning,
[3854.14 → 3854.64] Adam and
[3854.64 → 3854.84] Eve,
[3855.14 → 3855.60] and by
[3855.60 → 3855.94] them the
[3855.94 → 3856.24] rest of
[3856.24 → 3856.76] the humanity
[3856.76 → 3857.42] did not
[3857.42 → 3858.06] immediately
[3858.06 → 3858.52] die.
[3859.36 → 3859.60] And so,
[3859.84 → 3860.48] in grace,
[3860.78 → 3861.36] God is
[3861.36 → 3862.16] still holding
[3862.16 → 3862.98] the ultimate
[3862.98 → 3863.62] power of
[3863.62 → 3864.10] death at
[3864.10 → 3864.32] bay,
[3864.38 → 3864.76] at least
[3864.76 → 3865.20] for a
[3865.20 → 3865.52] span.
[3867.46 → 3868.06] But the
[3868.06 → 3869.98] death as
[3869.98 → 3871.04] the reality
[3871.04 → 3871.70] we all
[3871.70 → 3872.70] deserve and
[3872.70 → 3873.48] all face
[3873.48 → 3874.20] and live
[3874.20 → 3874.74] in now
[3874.74 → 3875.36] because of
[3875.36 → 3875.72] sin
[3875.72 → 3876.84] continues.
[3877.30 → 3877.62] And in
[3877.62 → 3878.08] the tenth
[3878.08 → 3878.70] plague,
[3879.84 → 3880.70] God unleashes
[3880.70 → 3881.36] that power.
[3882.24 → 3882.76] death.
[3882.90 → 3883.46] Now,
[3883.64 → 3884.26] sometimes,
[3884.64 → 3885.84] we say
[3885.84 → 3886.62] things like,
[3887.10 → 3887.22] well,
[3887.30 → 3887.66] death is
[3887.66 → 3888.14] natural.
[3889.52 → 3889.68] Right?
[3889.74 → 3890.20] And I get
[3890.20 → 3890.58] that it's a
[3890.58 → 3891.08] way that we
[3891.08 → 3891.94] cope with
[3891.94 → 3892.46] our grief
[3892.46 → 3893.02] and we
[3893.02 → 3893.70] minimize the
[3893.70 → 3894.34] experience by
[3894.34 → 3894.86] making it
[3894.86 → 3895.34] quote,
[3895.42 → 3895.92] normal.
[3896.74 → 3897.46] And when
[3897.46 → 3898.40] someone is
[3898.40 → 3899.10] 80 or
[3899.10 → 3899.78] 90 or
[3899.78 → 3900.42] 100 years
[3900.42 → 3900.74] old,
[3901.24 → 3901.58] we can
[3901.58 → 3902.34] easily feel
[3902.34 → 3902.76] that way.
[3904.04 → 3904.76] But there's
[3904.76 → 3905.52] nothing normal
[3905.52 → 3906.44] about dying,
[3907.02 → 3908.06] even when it
[3908.06 → 3908.58] happens all
[3908.58 → 3909.14] over the place
[3909.14 → 3909.62] and everywhere.
[3911.12 → 3911.58] There's nothing
[3911.58 → 3913.82] normal about
[3913.82 → 3914.28] losing a
[3914.28 → 3914.64] child.
[3919.50 → 3920.18] That's not
[3920.18 → 3921.04] the experience
[3921.04 → 3923.20] of creation
[3923.20 → 3924.54] that God
[3924.54 → 3925.00] wanted for
[3925.00 → 3925.34] us.
[3926.40 → 3927.10] And this
[3927.10 → 3927.60] idea,
[3927.84 → 3928.06] then,
[3928.12 → 3928.64] about death
[3928.64 → 3929.34] being unleashed,
[3929.42 → 3929.82] the idea
[3929.82 → 3930.70] built around
[3930.70 → 3931.14] the death
[3931.14 → 3931.78] of the lamb
[3931.78 → 3932.12] and the
[3932.12 → 3932.66] firstborn
[3932.66 → 3933.18] to pay
[3933.18 → 3933.90] for your
[3933.90 → 3934.32] freedom,
[3934.56 → 3935.24] is actually
[3935.24 → 3935.94] and ultimately
[3935.94 → 3937.38] magnified in
[3937.38 → 3937.96] the rest of
[3937.96 → 3938.92] this story,
[3939.04 → 3939.48] in the rest
[3939.48 → 3939.98] of the drama
[3939.98 → 3940.68] of scripture
[3940.68 → 3941.26] by the time
[3941.26 → 3941.64] we get to
[3941.64 → 3941.88] the New
[3941.88 → 3942.24] Testament,
[3942.38 → 3942.56] right?
[3943.80 → 3944.60] In Matthew
[3944.60 → 3945.12] and Mark
[3945.12 → 3945.62] and Luke,
[3946.48 → 3946.90] there's a
[3946.90 → 3947.58] record of
[3947.58 → 3948.48] Jesus
[3948.48 → 3950.42] having Passover
[3950.42 → 3951.94] when he
[3951.94 → 3952.92] celebrates his
[3952.92 → 3953.98] last supper
[3953.98 → 3955.54] with his
[3955.54 → 3956.42] disciples before
[3956.42 → 3957.92] his crucifixion.
[3958.38 → 3958.94] And in that
[3958.94 → 3959.38] moment,
[3959.80 → 3960.10] Jesus
[3960.10 → 3961.76] doesn't
[3961.76 → 3962.98] redefine the
[3962.98 → 3963.46] Passover,
[3964.10 → 3965.36] he shows us
[3965.36 → 3966.44] exactly what
[3966.44 → 3967.10] it was always
[3967.10 → 3967.86] meant to point
[3967.86 → 3968.10] to.
[3969.16 → 3969.94] The Passover
[3969.94 → 3970.72] is a
[3970.72 → 3971.78] liturgical
[3971.78 → 3972.66] reminder
[3972.66 → 3973.52] of being
[3973.52 → 3974.38] set free
[3974.38 → 3975.24] from slavery
[3975.24 → 3975.72] to an
[3975.72 → 3976.04] Egyptian
[3976.04 → 3976.46] pharaoh.
[3976.78 → 3976.96] And the
[3976.96 → 3977.38] Lord's
[3977.38 → 3977.66] Supper,
[3977.82 → 3978.48] building up
[3978.48 → 3978.92] on that,
[3979.00 → 3979.22] is a
[3979.22 → 3979.78] liturgical
[3979.78 → 3980.28] reminder,
[3980.40 → 3980.88] it is a
[3980.88 → 3981.66] sign and
[3981.66 → 3982.28] a seal
[3982.28 → 3982.96] of being
[3982.96 → 3983.74] set free
[3983.74 → 3984.84] from slavery
[3984.84 → 3985.74] to something
[3985.74 → 3986.38] more yet
[3986.38 → 3987.22] terrible.
[3989.28 → 3990.12] And so,
[3991.00 → 3991.60] recall
[3991.60 → 3993.20] that at least
[3993.20 → 3994.28] since the
[3994.28 → 3995.06] second temple
[3995.06 → 3995.38] period,
[3995.48 → 3996.00] at least since
[3996.00 → 3996.56] after the
[3996.56 → 3996.94] exile,
[3997.06 → 3997.56] the Passover
[3997.56 → 3998.36] has become
[3998.36 → 3998.82] a more
[3998.82 → 3999.30] regular
[3999.30 → 3999.98] practice.
[4000.56 → 4000.80] And so,
[4000.86 → 4001.32] there's some
[4001.32 → 4002.14] three,
[4002.40 → 4002.68] four,
[4002.82 → 4003.30] maybe even
[4003.30 → 4004.40] 500 years
[4004.40 → 4005.62] of cultural
[4005.62 → 4006.50] history and
[4006.50 → 4007.38] regularity
[4007.38 → 4008.70] ingrained in
[4008.70 → 4009.24] this moment
[4009.24 → 4009.82] of time when
[4009.82 → 4010.42] Jesus sits
[4010.42 → 4011.16] with his
[4011.16 → 4011.62] disciples.
[4011.82 → 4012.02] And so,
[4012.10 → 4012.64] the disciples
[4012.64 → 4013.82] sit with
[4013.82 → 4014.56] Jesus in
[4014.56 → 4015.10] that upper
[4015.10 → 4016.58] room celebrating
[4016.58 → 4017.50] the Passover
[4017.50 → 4018.38] feast.
[4019.32 → 4019.80] Now,
[4019.88 → 4020.60] by the time
[4020.60 → 4021.64] of Jesus,
[4022.32 → 4023.24] again,
[4023.44 → 4024.14] because of
[4024.14 → 4024.70] the Mishnah
[4024.70 → 4025.72] and other
[4025.72 → 4026.40] rabbinical
[4026.40 → 4026.84] teachings,
[4026.84 → 4027.46] there is a
[4027.46 → 4028.70] distinct form
[4028.70 → 4029.90] and liturgy
[4029.90 → 4030.60] that has taken
[4030.60 → 4031.30] place and
[4031.30 → 4031.90] taken root
[4031.90 → 4032.72] in Jewish
[4032.72 → 4033.90] society for
[4033.90 → 4034.54] the celebration
[4034.54 → 4035.22] of the Passover.
[4036.50 → 4037.24] During the
[4037.24 → 4037.52] meal,
[4038.54 → 4039.86] the leader
[4039.86 → 4040.72] of the family
[4040.72 → 4041.82] or the priest,
[4041.98 → 4042.38] depending on
[4042.38 → 4042.64] where it was
[4042.64 → 4043.36] being practiced,
[4043.76 → 4044.58] would stand
[4044.58 → 4046.12] up and then
[4046.12 → 4046.92] holding a cup
[4046.92 → 4047.54] of wine,
[4047.94 → 4048.18] they would
[4048.18 → 4049.24] explain the
[4049.24 → 4050.00] feast's
[4050.00 → 4050.34] meanings.
[4050.34 → 4051.86] And this
[4051.86 → 4052.46] would happen
[4052.46 → 4053.56] four times
[4053.56 → 4054.44] throughout the
[4054.44 → 4054.84] service,
[4055.52 → 4055.68] right?
[4055.78 → 4056.34] Four cups
[4056.34 → 4056.88] of wine
[4056.88 → 4057.64] and four
[4057.64 → 4058.38] explanations
[4058.38 → 4059.54] representing
[4059.54 → 4060.12] the four
[4060.12 → 4060.82] promises of
[4060.82 → 4061.46] God made
[4061.46 → 4062.04] in Exodus
[4062.04 → 4063.24] 6 to the
[4063.24 → 4063.48] people.
[4063.54 → 4063.94] The promise
[4063.94 → 4064.46] to rescue
[4064.46 → 4065.10] them from
[4065.10 → 4065.70] Egypt,
[4065.82 → 4066.16] the promise
[4066.16 → 4066.58] of freedom
[4066.58 → 4067.24] from slavery,
[4067.60 → 4067.98] the promise
[4067.98 → 4068.50] of redemption
[4068.50 → 4069.08] by God's
[4069.08 → 4069.40] power,
[4069.54 → 4069.76] and the
[4069.76 → 4070.32] promise of
[4070.32 → 4070.84] a renewed
[4070.84 → 4071.54] relationship
[4071.54 → 4072.56] with God.
[4073.60 → 4074.58] The third
[4074.58 → 4075.86] cup and
[4075.86 → 4076.24] the third
[4076.24 → 4077.20] promise would
[4077.20 → 4077.86] be raised
[4077.86 → 4078.78] near the end
[4078.78 → 4079.28] of the meal.
[4080.16 → 4080.52] And then the
[4080.52 → 4081.12] leader would
[4081.12 → 4081.82] speak the
[4081.82 → 4082.28] words of
[4082.28 → 4082.76] Deuteronomy
[4082.76 → 4083.60] 26 to
[4083.60 → 4084.64] bless the
[4084.64 → 4085.30] elements and
[4085.30 → 4086.04] to explain
[4086.04 → 4086.90] how they
[4086.90 → 4087.84] are symbolic
[4087.84 → 4088.80] reminders of
[4088.80 → 4089.62] Israel's
[4089.62 → 4090.56] afflictions,
[4090.72 → 4091.68] of Israel's
[4091.68 → 4092.34] slavery and
[4092.34 → 4092.82] of God's
[4092.82 → 4093.34] deliverance.
[4094.00 → 4094.16] And so,
[4094.24 → 4094.62] for example,
[4094.72 → 4095.28] he would lift
[4095.28 → 4096.12] a piece of
[4096.12 → 4096.94] unleavened bread
[4096.94 → 4097.46] and he would
[4097.46 → 4097.66] say,
[4098.24 → 4098.86] this is the
[4098.86 → 4099.84] bread of our
[4099.84 → 4100.50] affliction,
[4101.22 → 4102.16] which our
[4102.16 → 4102.94] fathers ate
[4102.94 → 4103.90] in the
[4103.90 → 4104.22] wilderness.
[4105.90 → 4106.62] And year
[4106.62 → 4107.84] after year
[4107.84 → 4108.76] now by this
[4108.76 → 4109.08] time,
[4109.14 → 4109.66] that same
[4109.66 → 4110.26] ceremony
[4110.26 → 4110.96] would be
[4110.96 → 4111.32] repeated
[4111.32 → 4112.08] with the
[4112.08 → 4112.88] same words
[4112.88 → 4114.14] spoken and
[4114.14 → 4114.66] the same
[4114.66 → 4115.38] history
[4115.38 → 4116.14] remembered.
[4117.04 → 4117.46] Everyone
[4117.46 → 4118.18] among them
[4118.18 → 4118.60] would know
[4118.60 → 4118.94] what was
[4118.94 → 4119.40] going to
[4119.40 → 4119.90] be said
[4119.90 → 4120.60] and know
[4120.60 → 4121.26] exactly
[4121.26 → 4122.08] when it
[4122.08 → 4122.38] would be
[4122.38 → 4122.68] said.
[4124.22 → 4124.82] For
[4124.82 → 4125.68] generations
[4125.68 → 4126.58] upon
[4126.58 → 4127.24] generations,
[4127.66 → 4128.30] it was the
[4128.30 → 4129.08] same words
[4129.08 → 4129.60] and the
[4129.60 → 4130.04] same time
[4130.04 → 4130.34] of year.
[4132.02 → 4132.40] And so,
[4133.68 → 4134.24] as Jesus
[4134.24 → 4135.08] provides over
[4135.08 → 4135.74] this Passover
[4135.74 → 4136.38] ceremony,
[4136.80 → 4137.86] when he is
[4137.86 → 4138.76] about to
[4138.76 → 4139.26] lift
[4139.26 → 4139.78] the third
[4139.78 → 4140.42] cup and
[4140.42 → 4141.14] reflect on
[4141.14 → 4141.62] the third
[4141.62 → 4142.52] promise,
[4142.86 → 4143.46] the disciples
[4143.46 → 4144.48] are expecting
[4144.48 → 4145.08] the same
[4145.08 → 4145.54] thing that
[4145.54 → 4145.80] they have
[4145.80 → 4146.28] heard ever
[4146.28 → 4147.14] since they
[4147.14 → 4147.50] were little
[4147.50 → 4147.90] boys.
[4149.56 → 4150.16] And instead,
[4151.18 → 4152.04] Jesus says,
[4152.72 → 4153.74] this is
[4153.74 → 4156.18] my body.
[4158.12 → 4158.60] Instead,
[4159.02 → 4159.70] Jesus says,
[4159.82 → 4161.18] this is my
[4161.18 → 4162.30] blood of the
[4162.30 → 4162.62] covenant,
[4162.76 → 4163.60] which is poured
[4163.60 → 4164.28] out for many.
[4164.28 → 4193.22] in Luke's
[4193.22 → 4193.56] gospel,
[4193.98 → 4194.84] Jesus says,
[4195.22 → 4196.08] this cup is
[4196.08 → 4196.60] the new
[4196.60 → 4197.48] covenant in
[4197.48 → 4198.60] my blood.
[4200.50 → 4201.60] The Passover
[4201.60 → 4203.32] supper of
[4203.32 → 4204.34] Jesus is
[4204.34 → 4205.64] marking a
[4205.64 → 4206.12] new beginning.
[4207.20 → 4207.70] Or perhaps
[4207.70 → 4208.58] we can say
[4208.58 → 4209.40] better, it's
[4209.40 → 4209.82] marking a
[4209.82 → 4211.32] culmination of
[4211.32 → 4211.96] something that
[4211.96 → 4213.30] God has been
[4213.30 → 4214.46] doing and is
[4214.46 → 4215.44] doing in and
[4215.44 → 4216.38] through him.
[4217.00 → 4217.74] Something that
[4217.74 → 4218.96] the whole history
[4218.96 → 4219.92] of Israel has
[4219.92 → 4221.10] been pointing to
[4221.10 → 4221.92] and anticipating
[4221.92 → 4223.42] and alluding to,
[4223.60 → 4224.16] but something
[4224.16 → 4225.00] that is new
[4225.00 → 4225.60] because it is
[4225.60 → 4226.28] now here
[4226.28 → 4227.30] and real
[4227.30 → 4228.08] in Jesus.
[4230.46 → 4231.14] Now, as I
[4231.14 → 4232.64] said, at the
[4232.64 → 4233.46] Passover feast,
[4233.80 → 4234.76] there are always
[4234.76 → 4235.72] three distinct
[4235.72 → 4236.38] elements.
[4236.52 → 4236.84] You have the
[4236.84 → 4237.46] bread, you have
[4237.46 → 4238.06] the wine, and
[4238.06 → 4238.42] you have a
[4238.42 → 4238.66] lamb.
[4239.54 → 4240.48] In Exodus
[4240.48 → 4241.84] 12, there are
[4241.84 → 4243.12] ten verses of
[4243.12 → 4244.32] rules for the
[4244.32 → 4245.04] lamb about where
[4245.04 → 4245.84] you can get it,
[4245.88 → 4246.40] how old it can
[4246.40 → 4246.92] be, about how
[4246.92 → 4247.32] you're supposed
[4247.32 → 4249.08] to prepare it,
[4249.12 → 4249.98] and about what
[4249.98 → 4250.28] you're supposed
[4250.28 → 4250.94] to do with it
[4250.94 → 4251.80] and when you're
[4251.80 → 4252.26] done with it,
[4252.30 → 4252.52] how you're
[4252.52 → 4253.28] supposed to get
[4253.28 → 4253.74] rid of it.
[4254.66 → 4256.26] And now, in
[4256.26 → 4257.78] the New Testament
[4257.78 → 4258.88] text, as we
[4258.88 → 4259.78] see that, where's
[4259.78 → 4260.20] the lamb?
[4261.94 → 4262.70] Is the lamb all
[4262.70 → 4263.16] of a sudden now
[4263.16 → 4263.94] optional?
[4266.02 → 4267.02] In Jesus'
[4267.40 → 4267.76] Passover
[4267.76 → 4268.62] celebration, there's
[4268.62 → 4269.78] no lamb to be
[4269.78 → 4270.96] eaten because, as
[4270.96 → 4272.16] Tim Keller says,
[4272.20 → 4272.98] there's no lamb on
[4272.98 → 4273.70] the table because
[4273.70 → 4274.56] the lamb of God
[4274.56 → 4276.16] is at the
[4276.16 → 4276.46] table.
[4277.90 → 4278.76] When John the
[4278.76 → 4279.82] Baptist first saw
[4279.82 → 4280.52] Jesus, what did
[4280.52 → 4280.84] he says?
[4281.90 → 4283.18] Behold, the
[4283.18 → 4284.18] lamb of God who
[4284.18 → 4285.48] takes away the
[4285.48 → 4286.46] sin of the
[4286.46 → 4286.76] world.
[4287.98 → 4289.58] In Isaiah 53, the
[4289.58 → 4290.68] prophet anticipates
[4290.68 → 4291.42] Jesus and says,
[4291.74 → 4292.64] the Lord has laid
[4292.64 → 4293.40] on him the
[4293.40 → 4294.32] iniquity of us
[4294.32 → 4294.50] all.
[4294.78 → 4295.70] He was oppressed
[4295.70 → 4296.94] and afflicted, yet
[4296.94 → 4297.74] he did not open
[4297.74 → 4298.14] his mouth.
[4298.24 → 4299.70] He was led like a
[4299.70 → 4301.16] lamb to the
[4301.16 → 4301.60] slaughter.
[4302.08 → 4302.74] He poured out
[4302.74 → 4303.64] his life unto
[4303.64 → 4304.30] death and was
[4304.30 → 4305.32] numbered with
[4305.32 → 4306.40] transgressors.
[4307.28 → 4307.50] Right?
[4307.54 → 4308.24] What Jesus is
[4308.24 → 4309.02] saying at this
[4309.02 → 4310.02] moment, at that
[4310.02 → 4310.90] table with his
[4310.90 → 4311.72] disciples is that
[4311.72 → 4312.82] I am the lamb of
[4312.82 → 4313.56] God who John
[4313.56 → 4314.26] spoke about.
[4314.34 → 4315.06] I am the lamb of
[4315.06 → 4315.96] God that Isaiah
[4315.96 → 4316.48] spoke about.
[4316.70 → 4317.58] I am the lamb of
[4317.58 → 4318.42] God to which all
[4318.42 → 4319.62] other lambs have
[4319.62 → 4319.98] pointed.
[4320.16 → 4321.18] I am the lamb of
[4321.18 → 4322.02] God that was first
[4322.02 → 4323.16] promised on that
[4323.16 → 4324.38] night, generations
[4324.38 → 4325.64] ago, millennia ago,
[4325.76 → 4327.16] back in Egypt.
[4328.28 → 4329.34] I am the lamb of
[4329.34 → 4330.52] God under whose
[4330.52 → 4332.86] blood you now take
[4332.86 → 4333.60] refuge.
[4334.54 → 4335.40] I am the lamb of
[4335.40 → 4336.30] God who takes away
[4336.30 → 4336.88] the sin of the
[4336.88 → 4337.06] world.
[4337.36 → 4338.60] And that is why we
[4338.60 → 4339.88] celebrate the Lord's
[4339.88 → 4340.12] Supper.
[4341.54 → 4341.98] Right?
[4342.02 → 4342.50] Because we are
[4342.50 → 4343.52] giving thanks for
[4343.52 → 4344.62] the lamb of God who
[4344.62 → 4346.44] takes away the sin of
[4346.44 → 4346.78] the world.
[4346.86 → 4348.56] And in the same way as
[4348.56 → 4349.84] the Passover was
[4349.84 → 4350.82] practiced, it is not
[4350.82 → 4351.62] enough just to
[4351.62 → 4353.42] sacrifice the lamb and
[4353.42 → 4354.20] be done with it.
[4354.32 → 4355.22] You have to take it
[4355.22 → 4355.36] in.
[4355.42 → 4356.12] You have to eat it.
[4356.82 → 4357.86] It has to be taken
[4357.86 → 4359.72] into your heart of
[4359.72 → 4360.04] hearts.
[4360.08 → 4360.96] In the same way, we
[4360.96 → 4361.90] eat the supper as a
[4361.90 → 4363.58] sign of our taking in
[4363.58 → 4365.10] the death and the
[4365.10 → 4366.16] resurrection of Jesus
[4366.16 → 4367.74] and appropriating it
[4367.74 → 4369.60] personally for
[4369.60 → 4370.04] ourselves.
[4370.44 → 4371.54] When we eat the
[4371.54 → 4372.64] bread and drink the
[4372.64 → 4373.54] cup, we are saying
[4373.54 → 4374.56] by the power of the
[4374.56 → 4375.36] Holy Spirit in the
[4375.36 → 4376.56] operation of grace
[4376.56 → 4377.54] through faith that I
[4377.54 → 4379.56] have died with Christ
[4379.56 → 4381.20] and I am being raised
[4381.20 → 4383.10] in new life with
[4383.10 → 4383.82] him.
[4386.20 → 4387.90] Jesus says, I am the
[4387.90 → 4388.78] living bread that came
[4388.78 → 4389.46] down from heaven.
[4389.70 → 4390.78] If anyone eats this
[4390.78 → 4391.82] bread, he will live
[4391.82 → 4392.20] forever.
[4392.20 → 4393.58] This bread is my
[4393.58 → 4394.94] flesh which I give
[4394.94 → 4396.36] for the life of the
[4396.36 → 4396.60] world.
[4396.70 → 4397.52] Whoever eats my
[4397.52 → 4398.66] flesh and drinks my
[4398.66 → 4399.72] blood has eternal
[4399.72 → 4401.24] life and I will raise
[4401.24 → 4402.52] him up that last day.
[4402.86 → 4403.64] Whoever eats my
[4403.64 → 4404.72] flesh and drinks my
[4404.72 → 4406.04] blood remains in me
[4406.04 → 4408.20] and I in him.
[4411.06 → 4412.22] Jewish Passover
[4412.22 → 4414.90] was celebrated with
[4414.90 → 4416.24] family, with
[4416.24 → 4416.76] community.
[4417.70 → 4418.94] Christian Eucharist,
[4419.04 → 4419.72] our Lord's Supper,
[4420.10 → 4421.36] is celebrated with a
[4421.36 → 4422.44] family that is not
[4422.44 → 4424.26] defined by blood or
[4424.26 → 4425.64] race or ethnicity.
[4426.68 → 4427.42] There's this beautiful
[4427.42 → 4428.70] quote from theologian
[4428.70 → 4429.42] D.A. Carson.
[4430.22 → 4432.68] He writes, what binds
[4432.68 → 4434.76] Christians together is
[4434.76 → 4436.08] not common education,
[4436.32 → 4437.54] not common race, not
[4437.54 → 4438.62] common income levels,
[4438.76 → 4440.20] common politics, common
[4440.20 → 4441.24] nationality, common
[4441.24 → 4442.44] accents, common jobs,
[4442.52 → 4443.66] or anything else of that
[4443.66 → 4443.86] sort.
[4444.22 → 4445.44] Christians come together
[4445.44 → 4446.54] because they have been
[4446.54 → 4448.18] saved by Jesus Christ.
[4448.18 → 4449.82] They are a band, hear
[4449.82 → 4451.22] this, of natural
[4451.22 → 4453.66] enemies who love one
[4453.66 → 4455.24] another for Jesus' sake.
[4457.74 → 4458.86] As we come to this
[4458.86 → 4461.34] table, is that your
[4461.34 → 4462.00] experience with the
[4462.00 → 4462.24] church?
[4464.42 → 4466.26] In the supper, we are
[4466.26 → 4467.28] participating in a
[4467.28 → 4468.52] Revelation 7 vision of
[4468.52 → 4469.30] the kingdom of God,
[4469.52 → 4470.96] where John looks and he
[4470.96 → 4472.44] sees there before me a
[4472.44 → 4473.58] great multitude that no
[4473.58 → 4474.56] one could count, from
[4474.56 → 4475.82] every nation, tribe,
[4475.82 → 4476.70] people and language,
[4477.14 → 4478.14] standing before the
[4478.14 → 4479.60] throne and in front of
[4479.60 → 4480.02] the Lamb.
[4480.86 → 4482.28] When we eat this bread
[4482.28 → 4483.54] and drink this cup, we
[4483.54 → 4485.26] are living into the
[4485.26 → 4487.12] future of God's work in
[4487.12 → 4488.36] this world, a future
[4488.36 → 4489.54] that has begun in the
[4489.54 → 4490.54] life, death, resurrection,
[4490.68 → 4491.72] and exaltation of Jesus,
[4491.86 → 4492.82] and a future that is
[4492.82 → 4494.62] culminating in that great
[4494.62 → 4496.24] banquet feast of the
[4496.24 → 4496.48] King.
[4499.26 → 4501.46] And so as we move to the
[4501.46 → 4504.12] table, as we come
[4504.12 → 4506.14] together in the presence
[4506.14 → 4508.14] of Jesus, know that we
[4508.14 → 4510.14] come to the Lamb of God
[4510.14 → 4513.40] who takes away sin of the
[4513.40 → 4513.68] world.
[4515.84 → 4517.78] And now, full circle,
[4518.78 → 4519.62] remember that idea that I
[4519.62 → 4520.26] asked you to park?
[4520.92 → 4521.14] Right?
[4521.22 → 4521.72] Unpack it.
[4524.66 → 4526.32] The Passover is to
[4526.32 → 4527.36] underscore and prioritize
[4527.36 → 4528.56] this new theological
[4528.56 → 4530.26] identity and make sense of
[4530.26 → 4532.20] this liturgical interlude.
[4532.20 → 4535.68] chapter 12 is weird.
[4536.22 → 4536.78] Right?
[4536.84 → 4537.90] It almost doesn't fit into
[4537.90 → 4538.38] the story.
[4538.76 → 4540.12] It breaks the rhythm and
[4540.12 → 4542.58] yet it has a theological
[4542.58 → 4544.26] purpose to underscore our
[4544.26 → 4544.70] identity.
[4545.20 → 4547.10] That's what worship does.
[4548.34 → 4549.80] And to the world around us,
[4550.08 → 4551.46] worship will look weird.
[4552.72 → 4554.78] What we do here is going to
[4554.78 → 4555.78] be strange to the
[4555.78 → 4556.38] uninitiated.
[4556.46 → 4557.64] Can you imagine having
[4557.64 → 4558.94] zero exposure to Christian
[4558.94 → 4560.34] faith, walking into church
[4560.34 → 4562.42] today and hearing me say,
[4562.66 → 4564.18] unless you eat my body and
[4564.18 → 4565.44] drink my blood, you will not
[4565.44 → 4566.24] have eternal life.
[4567.92 → 4568.36] Right?
[4568.36 → 4569.56] If that doesn't sound weird
[4569.56 → 4571.90] to you, you might be a
[4571.90 → 4573.08] little apathetic to what's
[4573.08 → 4573.98] actually going on here.
[4575.10 → 4575.92] That's weird.
[4576.28 → 4577.24] It's strange.
[4577.42 → 4578.40] And it needs to be.
[4578.58 → 4579.56] And if this is your first
[4579.56 → 4580.68] time here, either in person
[4580.68 → 4582.84] or online, I hope that you're
[4582.84 → 4584.06] feeling that weirdness because
[4584.06 → 4584.66] that's good.
[4586.00 → 4586.96] But don't get me wrong.
[4586.96 → 4588.92] I hope that you feel
[4588.92 → 4589.32] welcomed.
[4590.20 → 4590.98] And I hope that your
[4590.98 → 4592.14] heart's affections are
[4592.14 → 4592.48] piqued.
[4592.70 → 4593.16] I hope that your
[4593.16 → 4594.44] imaginations are struck by
[4594.44 → 4595.58] an experience of the glory
[4595.58 → 4597.48] of God, however small and
[4597.48 → 4598.78] minimal that may be at this
[4598.78 → 4599.10] point.
[4599.80 → 4602.74] But if it seems strange, it
[4602.74 → 4603.10] should.
[4604.46 → 4606.16] Lean into the mystery.
[4607.58 → 4609.40] The liturgical interludes
[4609.40 → 4611.24] break the rhythm of your
[4611.24 → 4613.96] ordinary to give you a new
[4613.96 → 4614.60] identity.
[4614.60 → 4614.72] identity.
[4615.58 → 4616.68] That's for all of us.
[4617.90 → 4618.00] Right?
[4618.04 → 4619.30] That's what worship does.
[4619.86 → 4620.62] That's what the Lord's
[4620.62 → 4621.14] Supper does.
[4621.52 → 4623.72] God is telling us who we are
[4623.72 → 4625.24] in his eyes.
[4626.42 → 4628.16] God is reminding us what he
[4628.16 → 4629.84] has done for us.
[4630.46 → 4630.56] Right?
[4630.58 → 4632.42] The theological definition of
[4632.42 → 4634.20] your life in relationship to
[4634.20 → 4636.32] God is the one that matters.
[4637.12 → 4637.28] Right?
[4637.34 → 4638.82] Who you are by grace through
[4638.82 → 4640.34] faith is what matters.
[4640.46 → 4642.44] Your everlasting identity is
[4642.44 → 4644.48] from him and nothing else or
[4644.48 → 4646.18] no one else can give you
[4646.18 → 4646.52] that.
[4647.94 → 4650.70] Liturgy and worship breaks
[4650.70 → 4652.62] into the ordinary in order to
[4652.62 → 4654.52] teach us something extraordinary.
[4655.18 → 4655.28] Right?
[4655.30 → 4657.24] The supernatural pours into the
[4657.24 → 4658.76] natural in order to reveal
[4658.76 → 4659.68] what truly is.
[4659.94 → 4662.08] We eat in grace so that we can
[4662.08 → 4663.86] live in peace.
[4666.38 → 4667.78] Don't miss what happens here.
[4667.78 → 4671.30] Don't downplay what happens
[4671.30 → 4671.56] here.
[4672.50 → 4672.72] Right?
[4672.78 → 4674.50] In liturgy, in worship, from
[4674.50 → 4677.02] the word and at the table, God
[4677.02 → 4679.68] is breaking into the chaos of
[4679.68 → 4682.76] your life to give you himself.
[4683.34 → 4685.14] And so parents, tell your
[4685.14 → 4685.56] children.
[4685.94 → 4688.26] Everyone, tell your friends, come
[4688.26 → 4690.96] to the table and behold the
[4690.96 → 4694.10] Lamb of God who takes away the
[4694.10 → 4695.72] sin of the world.
[4695.72 → 4696.76] Let's pray.
[4704.44 → 4709.12] Lord our God, we come to your
[4709.12 → 4709.86] table.
[4710.08 → 4712.50] May we see you.
[4713.82 → 4718.10] As we come to your table, a band
[4718.10 → 4721.16] of natural enemies made one body
[4721.16 → 4722.90] new in you.
[4722.90 → 4725.84] As we come to your table, restore
[4725.84 → 4729.82] us to the joy of your new
[4729.82 → 4731.62] creation life.
[4731.62 → 4735.16] We come to this table, Lord Jesus, to
[4735.16 → 4739.16] see you and to be held by you in
[4739.16 → 4739.58] grace.
[4741.04 → 4743.52] Fill us for the journey of faith
[4743.52 → 4744.40] ahead.
[4745.60 → 4747.82] And God, by your spirit, help us to
[4747.82 → 4749.00] embrace the weird.
[4749.52 → 4751.12] Help us to embrace the strange.
[4751.30 → 4754.94] Help us to be those people who stand
[4754.94 → 4757.48] out because of the gospel.
[4757.48 → 4760.58] In your name, Lord Jesus, we pray.
[4761.58 → 4761.96] Amen.
[4769.96 → 4771.58] Please stand with us.
[4771.58 → 4798.42] Our hearts are
[4798.42 → 4804.48] Holy, holy is He
[4804.48 → 4811.14] Sing a new song
[4811.14 → 4815.22] To Him who sits on
[4815.22 → 4820.68] Heaven's mercy seat
[4820.68 → 4826.88] Worthy is Thine
[4826.88 → 4830.56] Lamb who was slain
[4830.56 → 4836.10] Holy, holy is He
[4836.10 → 4842.10] Sing a new song
[4842.10 → 4845.94] To Him who sits on
[4845.94 → 4850.50] Heaven's mercy seat
[4850.50 → 4860.72] Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty
[4860.72 → 4866.18] Who was and is and is to come
[4866.18 → 4873.18] With all creation I sing
[4873.18 → 4876.72] Praise to the King of kings
[4876.72 → 4879.94] You are my everything
[4879.94 → 4885.62] And I will adore you
[4885.62 → 4907.30] Golden rainbows of living colour
[4907.30 → 4910.48] Flashes of lightning
[4910.48 → 4912.98] Rose of thunder
[4912.98 → 4922.98] Blessing and honour, strength and glory and power lead
[4922.98 → 4929.66] To you, the only wise king
[4929.66 → 4938.46] Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty

[4981.10 → 4984.78] Awestruck wonder
[4984.78 → 4991.32] At the mention of your name
[4991.32 → 4996.78] Jesus, your name is power
[4996.78 → 4997.78] Breath of thunder
[4997.78 → 4998.78] Breath of thunder
[4998.78 → 4999.78] Breath of thunder
[4999.78 → 5000.78] Breath of thunder
[5000.78 → 5001.78] Breath of thunder
[5001.78 → 5002.78] Breath of thunder
[5002.78 → 5003.78] Such a marvellous history
[5003.78 → 5005.46] Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty
[5005.46 → 5015.46] Holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty
[5015.46 → 5020.46] Who was and is and is to come

[5064.02 → 5065.02] You are my everything
[5065.02 → 5068.02] And I will adore you
[5068.02 → 5072.02] You are my everything
[5072.02 → 5074.02] You are my everything
[5074.02 → 5076.02] And I will adore you
[5076.02 → 5098.86] Have a seat together
[5098.86 → 5101.62] As we come to the table
[5101.62 → 5104.34] Of our king
[5104.34 → 5107.38] To the table of the lamb
[5107.38 → 5110.14] Who was not on the table
[5110.14 → 5111.58] Because he was at the table
[5111.58 → 5113.94] You are now invited
[5113.94 → 5116.36] At his last supper
[5116.36 → 5119.32] The Lord Jesus took the bread
[5119.32 → 5122.52] And when he had given thanks
[5122.52 → 5124.42] He broke it and said
[5124.42 → 5127.18] This is the bread of my affliction
[5127.18 → 5131.42] Do this in remembrance of me
[5131.42 → 5135.16] In the same way he took the cup
[5135.16 → 5136.00] After supper
[5136.00 → 5137.74] And he said
[5137.74 → 5139.82] This cup is the new covenant
[5139.82 → 5141.18] In my blood
[5141.18 → 5145.30] Do this in remembrance of me
[5145.30 → 5148.58] For whenever we eat this bread
[5148.58 → 5150.92] And drink this cup
[5150.92 → 5152.78] We proclaim the Lord's death
[5152.78 → 5153.76] And resurrection
[5153.76 → 5156.10] Until he comes again
[5156.10 → 5158.88] Therefore we proclaim our faith
[5158.88 → 5160.84] As signed and sealed
[5160.84 → 5162.94] In this sacrament
[5162.94 → 5171.62] Church family
[5171.62 → 5174.74] The Lord has prepared his table
[5174.74 → 5176.70] For all who love him
[5176.70 → 5178.50] And who trust in him alone
[5178.50 → 5179.84] For their salvation
[5179.84 → 5181.68] So if you are truly sorry
[5181.68 → 5182.48] For your sins
[5182.48 → 5183.86] If you sincerely believe
[5183.86 → 5185.12] In the Lord Jesus
[5185.12 → 5185.92] As your saviour
[5185.92 → 5187.44] And if you desire to live
[5187.44 → 5188.72] In obedience to him
[5188.72 → 5189.48] Whether you are here
[5189.48 → 5190.96] Present or participating
[5190.96 → 5192.40] Online at home
[5192.40 → 5193.76] You are now invited
[5193.76 → 5195.28] To come with gladness
[5195.28 → 5197.46] To the table of the Lord
[5197.46 → 5199.12] The gifts of God

[5240.96 → 5246.46] How fast beyond the measure
[5246.46 → 5252.96] That he should give his only Son
[5252.96 → 5259.02] To gain the wretched pleasure
[5259.02 → 5266.46] How great the King of Tear and Pops
[5266.46 → 5272.66] The Father turns his face away
[5272.66 → 5279.06] As wounds which are the Chosen One

[5341.34 → 5346.78] I know that it is today
[5346.78 → 5364.84] I will not boast in anything
[5364.84 → 5372.28] No gifts, no power, no wisdom
