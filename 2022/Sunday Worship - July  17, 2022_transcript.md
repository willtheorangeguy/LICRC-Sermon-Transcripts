[509.56 --> 509.96]  Amen.
[516.54 --> 521.76]  Our call to worship comes from Psalm 103, verses 19 to 22.
[521.76 --> 531.92]  The Lord has established his throne in heaven and his kingdom rules over all.
[532.88 --> 539.30]  Praise the Lord, you his angels, you mighty ones who do his bidding, who obey his word.
[540.26 --> 545.48]  Praise the Lord, all his heavenly hosts, you his servants who do his will.
[546.22 --> 550.32]  Praise the Lord, all his works, everywhere in his dominion.
[551.76 --> 579.76]  Praise my soul, the King of heaven,
[579.76 --> 585.74]  To his feet your tribute bring.
[586.14 --> 590.68]  Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven.
[591.36 --> 596.16]  Evermore his praises sing.
[597.44 --> 601.64]  Alleluia, alleluia.
[601.98 --> 606.76]  Praise the everlasting King.
[606.76 --> 620.04]  Praise him for his grace and favor, to his people in distress.
[620.50 --> 631.10]  Praise him still the same as ever, slow to chide and swift to bless.
[631.10 --> 633.10]  Alleluia, alleluia.
[633.10 --> 636.10]  Alleluia, alleluia.

[650.32 --> 655.32]  Well, our feeble frame he knows.

[666.24 --> 671.78]  Alleluia, alleluia.
[671.78 --> 677.32]  Widely yet his mercy flows.
[677.32 --> 684.32]  Angels, help us to adore him.
[684.32 --> 691.32]  You behold him face to face.
[691.32 --> 696.32]  Sun and moon bow down before him.
[696.32 --> 702.32]  Dwellers all in time and space.
[702.32 --> 707.32]  Alleluia, alleluia.
[707.32 --> 714.32]  Praise him, us the God of grace.

[720.32 --> 724.32]  Come, thou fount of every blessing.
[724.32 --> 741.32]  To my heart to sing thy grace.
[741.32 --> 742.32]  Streams of mercy never ceasing.
[742.32 --> 748.32]  Call for songs of loudest praise.
[748.32 --> 749.32]  Teach me some melodious sonnet.
[749.32 --> 750.32]  Sung by flaming tongues above.
[750.32 --> 751.32]  Praise the mount I'm fixed upon.
[751.32 --> 752.32]  I'm a son of my heart to sing thy grace.
[752.32 --> 755.32]  Streams of mercy never ceasing.
[755.32 --> 756.32]  Call for songs of loudest praise.
[756.32 --> 757.32]  Call for songs of loudest praise.
[757.32 --> 758.32]  Teach me some melodious sonnet.
[758.32 --> 759.32]  Sung by flaming tongues above.
[759.32 --> 762.32]  Praise the mount I'm fixed upon it.
[762.32 --> 763.32]  Mount of thy redeeming love.
[763.32 --> 764.32]  Teach me some melodious sonnet.
[764.32 --> 768.32]  Teach me some melodious sonnet.
[768.32 --> 773.32]  Sung by flaming tongues above.
[773.32 --> 778.32]  Praise the mount I'm fixed upon it.
[778.32 --> 784.32]  Mount of thy redeeming love.
[784.32 --> 797.32]  Here I raise my Ebenezer.
[797.32 --> 803.32]  Hither by thy help I'm come.
[803.32 --> 808.32]  And I hope by thy good pleasure
[808.32 --> 814.32]  Safely to arrive at home.
[814.32 --> 819.32]  Jesus sought me when a stranger
[819.32 --> 825.32]  Wandering from the fold of God
[825.32 --> 830.32]  He to rescue me from danger
[830.32 --> 836.32]  Interposed his precious blood.
[838.32 --> 859.32]  O to grace how great a debtor
[859.32 --> 865.32]  Daily I'm constrained to be
[865.32 --> 871.32]  Let thy goodness like a fetter
[871.32 --> 876.32]  Bind my wandering heart to thee
[876.32 --> 882.32]  Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it
[882.32 --> 887.32]  Prone to leave the God I love
[887.32 --> 893.32]  Here's my heart, Lord, take and seal it
[893.32 --> 897.32]  Seal it for thy courts
[897.32 --> 908.32]  Above all else I adore your name
[908.32 --> 918.32]  Above all else tune my heart to sing your praise
[918.32 --> 923.32]  Above all else I adore your praise
[923.32 --> 925.32]  Above all else I adore your praise
[925.32 --> 939.32]  Above all else tune my heart to sing your praise
[939.32 --> 950.32]  Above all else, I adore your name.
[951.32 --> 960.40]  Above all else, tune my heart to sing your praise.
[960.40 --> 971.68]  Above all else, I adore your name.
[972.08 --> 980.40]  Above all else, tune my heart to sing your praise.
[980.40 --> 992.40]  The highest praise, the loudest praise to the name of every day.
[1002.40 --> 1004.54]  From Titus 3.
[1004.54 --> 1014.68]  At one time, we too were foolish, disobedient, deceived, and enslaved by all kinds of passions and pleasures.
[1015.52 --> 1020.22]  We lived in malice and envy, being hated and hating one another.
[1021.48 --> 1026.92]  But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared, he saved us.
[1027.38 --> 1032.48]  Not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy.
[1032.48 --> 1038.12]  He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit,
[1038.84 --> 1043.40]  whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior,
[1044.10 --> 1051.90]  so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs, having the hope of eternal life.
[1062.48 --> 1075.00]  Jesus, I've forgotten the words that you have spoken,
[1075.00 --> 1088.98]  Jesus, I've forgotten the words that you have spoken.
[1089.98 --> 1096.54]  Promises that burned within my heart have now grown dear.
[1096.54 --> 1104.54]  With a doubting heart I follow the paths of earthly wisdom.
[1104.54 --> 1112.54]  Forgive me for my unbelief, renew them far again.
[1112.54 --> 1128.54]  Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy, Lord have mercy on me.
[1128.54 --> 1144.54]  Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy, Lord have mercy on me.
[1146.54 --> 1153.92]  I have built an altar where I've worshipped things of man.
[1153.92 --> 1160.92]  I have taken journeys that have drawn me far from you.
[1160.92 --> 1168.92]  Now I am returning to your mercies ever flowing.
[1168.92 --> 1176.92]  Pardon my transgressions, help me love you again.
[1176.92 --> 1193.92]  Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy, Lord have mercy on me.
[1193.92 --> 1209.92]  Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy, Lord have mercy on me.
[1211.92 --> 1223.00]  I have longed to know you, and all your tender mercies like a river of forgiveness.
[1223.92 --> 1242.92]  I am not pretending to do not sia springe thing.
[1242.92 --> 1252.76]  Lord have mercy Christ have mercy
[1252.76 --> 1260.04]  Lord have mercy on me
[1260.04 --> 1268.10]  Lord have mercy Christ have mercy
[1268.10 --> 1276.02]  Lord have mercy on me
[1276.02 --> 1277.10]  Lord have mercy on me
[1298.10 --> 1328.08]  Lord have mercy on me
[1328.08 --> 1358.06]  Lord have mercy on me
[1358.08 --> 1388.06]  Lord have mercy on me
[1388.06 --> 1418.04]  Lord have mercy on me
[1418.04 --> 1448.02]  Lord have mercy on me
[1448.02 --> 1478.00]  Lord have mercy on me
[1478.00 --> 1507.98]  Lord have mercy on me
[1507.98 --> 1537.96]  Lord have mercy on me
[1537.96 --> 1567.94]  Lord have mercy on me
[1567.94 --> 1597.92]  Lord have mercy on me
[1597.92 --> 1627.90]  Lord have mercy on me
[1627.90 --> 1657.88]  Lord have mercy on me
[1657.88 --> 1687.86]  Lord have mercy on me
[1687.86 --> 1717.84]  Lord have mercy on me
[1717.84 --> 1747.82]  Lord have mercy on me
[1747.82 --> 1777.80]  Lord have mercy on me
[1777.80 --> 1807.78]  Lord have mercy on me
[1807.78 --> 1837.76]  Lord have mercy on me
[1837.76 --> 1867.74]  Lord have mercy on me
[1867.74 --> 1897.72]  Lord have mercy on me
[1897.74 --> 1927.72]  Lord have mercy on me
[1927.72 --> 1957.70]  Jesus you will
[1957.70 --> 1987.68]  Lord have mercy on me
[1987.68 --> 2017.66]  Lord have mercy on me
[2017.68 --> 2047.66]  Lord have mercy on me
[2047.66 --> 2077.64]  Lord have mercy on me
[2077.64 --> 2107.62]  Lord have mercy on me
[2107.62 --> 2137.60]  Lord have mercy on me
[2137.60 --> 2167.58]  you know who's
[2167.58 --> 2197.56]  Lord have mercy on me
[2197.58 --> 2227.56]  Lord have mercy on me
[2227.56 --> 2257.54]  and install them and pray on me
[2257.54 --> 2287.52]  Lord have mercy on me
[2287.52 --> 2317.50]  Lord have mercy on me
[2317.50 --> 2347.48]  Lord have mercy on me
[2347.48 --> 2377.46]  Lord have mercy on me
[2377.46 --> 2407.44]  Lord have mercy on me
[2407.44 --> 2437.42]  Lord have mercy on me
[2437.42 --> 2467.40]  I probably shouldn't have mercy on me
[2467.40 --> 2497.38]  Lord have mercy on me
[2497.40 --> 2527.36]  I do with God's
[2527.38 --> 2557.34]  and guide you and guide you and I'll see you and God's
[2557.34 --> 2557.36] 
[2587.34 --> 2617.32]  Lord have mercy on me
[2617.32 --> 2647.32] 
[2647.32 --> 2677.30]  justice and justice and justice
[2677.30 --> 2677.32] 
[2707.30 --> 2713.86]  honor and take their counsel seriously. Respect and respond to them with obedience and respect
[2713.86 --> 2721.90]  and accept their help with thanks. Wholeheartedly participate in the ministries into which they lead
[2721.90 --> 2728.46]  you and sustain them in prayer and encourage them with your support, especially when they feel the
[2728.46 --> 2736.40]  burden of their office and acknowledge them as the Lord's servant among you. If you are willing to do
[2736.40 --> 2741.80]  that, I'm going to ask a question here and invite you to respond with the words as you see them. Do you
[2741.80 --> 2747.32]  then, Emmanuel Church, pledge to receive them as you have been charged?
[2751.38 --> 2758.42]  Amen. I'm going to invite Eric to come to the front and he's going to pray for us.
[2766.40 --> 2787.56]  My name is Eric Kubert. I'm an elder here at Emmanuel and I'd like to lead you in our church family prayer.
[2787.56 --> 2794.98]  Lord, we come to you this morning. Thank you for the opportunity to once come together as your people.
[2795.60 --> 2800.14]  Thank you for this community and for the time we can have to spend together in worship of your name.
[2801.26 --> 2808.20]  As David says in Psalm 103, praise the Lord, O my soul, all my inmost being, praise his holy name.
[2809.94 --> 2815.36]  Praise the Lord, O my soul, forgot not all his benefits, who forgives all our sins,
[2815.36 --> 2821.92]  heals all our diseases, who redeems your life from the pit and crowns you with love and compassion.
[2826.64 --> 2831.10]  Our merciful Father in heaven, we thank you for providing these faithful gifts
[2831.10 --> 2838.34]  and gifted people to serve as deacons. As the new office bearers assume their responsibilities,
[2839.12 --> 2843.96]  fill them with your spirit, enable them with your wisdom, grant them strength,
[2843.96 --> 2850.14]  make them faithful workers in your vineyard. Under your guidance, may your church grow in every
[2850.14 --> 2858.96]  spiritual grace and faith which is open and unashamed and committed service that promotes your reign,
[2859.30 --> 2866.84]  the world. Help them perform their duties with enthusiasm, humility in their work. Grant them a sense of awe
[2866.84 --> 2875.18]  in this model and daily adoration of you, their Lord. Through them, may your name be honored and your
[2875.18 --> 2882.02]  church be saved. Help us, your people, to accept them gladly. Encourage them always and respect them for
[2882.02 --> 2890.04]  the sake of your precious Son, our Lord, whose name we pray. Lord, we are so thankful for the time of year
[2890.04 --> 2896.56]  when any of us are able to take time off and enjoy the beautiful creation. Taking a vacation,
[2897.64 --> 2902.56]  whether we're staying here or traveling abroad, we pray for a relaxing and safe travels.
[2904.06 --> 2908.80]  We also want to pray for those people in our congregation who are dealing with injuries.
[2909.22 --> 2915.72]  We pray for continued healing for Harry as he's recuperating from surgery on both his arms.
[2915.72 --> 2922.60]  We pray for the patients he needs each and every day he rests and waits for healing. We also pray that
[2922.60 --> 2931.12]  he's able to regain full mobility in his arms again. We also want to pay for Ellen as she's recovering
[2931.12 --> 2937.52]  from her fall from a couple weeks ago. We pray for healing as the doctors determine what actions need
[2937.52 --> 2942.48]  to be taken in order to have her wrist fully heal from her injury.
[2944.08 --> 2948.82]  This past week, we had the opportunity to host the kids' camp with kids from around the community
[2948.82 --> 2953.80]  attending. We are thankful for those who shared their gifts of leadership and for those who volunteered
[2953.80 --> 2959.80]  to help. Use the Bible lessons and activities the kids took part in to speak in their young lives.
[2959.80 --> 2967.72]  We also thank you for yesterday's pancake breakfast and for the donations we were given for the Langley Food Bank.
[2968.12 --> 2972.54]  May the food we collected be a blessing in our community and help us to continue to remember
[2972.54 --> 2975.34]  those in our community who need support in this way.
[2977.24 --> 2980.76]  We also want to pray for the many strained relationships in our community.
[2981.62 --> 2984.20]  Lord, bring your grace and restoration to our relationships.
[2984.20 --> 2991.00]  There are marriages, parent and child relationships, and other family connections that have been broken.
[2991.50 --> 2994.76]  We pray for your spirit to bring resolution and forgiveness.
[2996.28 --> 3000.90]  For great is your love reaching to the heavens. Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.
[3001.70 --> 3007.00]  Be exalted, O God, above the heavens. Let your glory be over the earth. Amen.
[3014.20 --> 3042.22]  I'd like to tell a story, if I may. Actually, it's a little bit more of a joke, but it's a joke
[3042.22 --> 3048.90]  that comes in the form of a story. So there was this high school student, grade 12 student in America,
[3048.90 --> 3054.10]  and he was very excited for his prom. And he was really excited. He had his date, and he was looking
[3054.10 --> 3058.82]  forward to this night, and he thought, oh, I better get myself a nice tuxedo. And so he went to the
[3058.82 --> 3064.06]  tuxedo rental shop, and he found one that he liked that fit nice, and he went to go pay, and there was
[3064.06 --> 3068.84]  just this really long line. So he stood in this line, and he waited, and he waited, and he waited, and finally
[3068.84 --> 3072.98]  he paid for his tuxedo, and he thought, oh, now I need a nice pair of shoes to go with this tuxedo.
[3073.06 --> 3077.92]  And so he went three doors down to this local shoe shop, and he found this beautiful pair of black
[3077.92 --> 3082.26]  shoes, and he tried them on, and they fit nice, and he went to pay, and again, there was just this
[3082.26 --> 3086.60]  really long line. So he waited in this line, and he waited, and he waited, and he waited, and finally
[3086.60 --> 3092.52]  he paid for the shoes. And he thought, oh, you know what? I need a carnation. I need a carnation for my
[3092.52 --> 3096.70]  date. She loves carnations. I need to go get her a carnation. So he went to the flower store, and he
[3096.70 --> 3102.02]  found this beautiful bouquet of flowers, and he went to go pay, and again, there's just this really
[3102.02 --> 3106.50]  long line. And so he stands in line, and he waits, and he waits, and he waits, and he waits, and finally
[3106.50 --> 3110.00]  he buys the flowers, and he's like, all right, yeah, now I'm ready to go. I need to show up, though,
[3110.60 --> 3115.88]  looking good, and so I should rent a limousine. And so he goes to the, like, the little car dealership
[3115.88 --> 3120.16]  place, and he finds that he can get one, and it's a pretty good deal, and so he goes to pay for this
[3120.16 --> 3125.38]  limousine, and again, it's just this long line. So he's waiting, and he's waiting, and he's waiting, and he's
[3125.38 --> 3129.28]  waiting in line to pay for his limousine, and finally he gets the, gets his limousine. He shows
[3129.28 --> 3134.56]  up to his dates house, picks her up, heads to prom, and he's all excited, and they're excited to go to
[3134.56 --> 3139.32]  this, this prom together, and he shows up, and there's this long line of cars, because there's
[3139.32 --> 3144.30]  valet parking, and he has to wait in this line before he can finally attend this prom, and he's
[3144.30 --> 3149.08]  waiting, and he's waiting, and he's waiting, and he's waiting, and finally he gets to go to prom, and when
[3149.08 --> 3156.44]  he gets inside, oh, you won't believe what happens next. Stories without endings suck, don't they?
[3157.88 --> 3162.96]  Like, we all kind of want to hear what happens to this guy in this prom. We all want to know what
[3162.96 --> 3170.42]  happens next, and by the looks on some of your faces, you need to know what happens next. Well, in this
[3170.42 --> 3174.94]  sermon series, we're looking at stories that Jesus told, and believe it or not, many of these stories,
[3174.94 --> 3181.66]  many of these parables don't actually end. They're just kind of left to hang for the reader or the
[3181.66 --> 3187.72]  listener to finish on their own, and we're going to look at one of those parables this morning, the
[3187.72 --> 3193.32]  parable of the barren fig tree. If you've got your Bibles open, you can open them up with you. We're
[3193.32 --> 3198.68]  going to read this there. I also encourage you to keep that open throughout the sermon. If you've got
[3198.68 --> 3202.72]  it on your phones, that's good too, and read with me what happens. It'll be on the screen behind as
[3202.72 --> 3208.88]  well. Luke 13, verses 6 to 9. That's just a short little parable there, and there we read this.
[3209.92 --> 3218.40]  Then he, that is Jesus, told this parable. A man had a fig tree growing in his vineyard, and he went
[3218.40 --> 3224.98]  to look for fruit on it, but did not find any. So he said to the man who took care of the vineyard,
[3225.10 --> 3230.12]  for three years now I've been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree, and I haven't found any.
[3230.12 --> 3237.84]  Cut it down. Why should it use up the soil? Sir, the man replied, the vine dresser, as some
[3237.84 --> 3242.92]  translations say, leave it alone for one more year, and I'll dig around it and fertilize it.
[3243.16 --> 3251.46]  If it bears fruit next year, fine. If not, cut it down then. The word of the Lord.
[3251.46 --> 3257.74]  So like my story about the guy going to prom, which I mean, we'll see if I finish that story a little
[3257.74 --> 3262.76]  bit later in the sermon, because the ending is really good. We're left wondering, what happens?
[3263.34 --> 3270.06]  What happened to this tree? Did the tree survive, or did it get dug out? Did it produce good fruit,
[3270.18 --> 3276.12]  or did it remain barren? Did it respond to the vine dresser's work, or does it simply remain
[3276.12 --> 3283.22]  unfruitful? Now as Pastor Chris mentioned last week, Sunday, in some ways we can look at a parable
[3283.22 --> 3287.10]  like this, and we can get a quick understanding of sort of what's going on here. In this case,
[3287.12 --> 3291.84]  if we were to take a snapshot of this parable, an easy read would maybe say, we're to be fruitful
[3291.84 --> 3298.28]  for Jesus. But again, like Pastor Chris said last week, with parables there's always some
[3298.28 --> 3304.54]  obfuscation, which again, as we learned, is an unnecessarily confusing word, which means
[3304.54 --> 3310.30]  unnecessarily confusing. That means there's a little work that we have to do, and a little
[3310.30 --> 3315.12]  faith that we have to have in order to really squeeze out what Jesus is getting at here.
[3315.42 --> 3321.50]  Oftentimes this can be done by looking at who is in this parable. So in this story, who is the owner
[3321.50 --> 3327.94]  of this vineyard? Or who is the vine dresser? Who does the fig tree, or what does the fig tree represent?
[3329.14 --> 3333.64]  What is the vineyard, or where is the vineyard? Those are questions that generally help us
[3333.64 --> 3341.36]  get to the bottom of what parables mean. The problem is, this parable itself is actually a
[3341.36 --> 3347.58]  little bit confusing. See, scholars across time, they've disagreed on what the symbols mean in this
[3347.58 --> 3354.24]  parable, more than most parables from what I gather. Like, is the vine dresser Jesus, and the owner God?
[3355.08 --> 3359.38]  Aren't God and Jesus one and the same? How can they be different? Can you even separate the two?
[3359.38 --> 3364.00]  What about the fig tree? Are those the disciples? Are they the Jewish leaders? Are they the Jewish people?
[3364.70 --> 3370.84]  Are they the church? The crowd was a big smattering of everyone there. It's got to be a person, right?
[3371.14 --> 3378.48]  What about the vineyard itself? Is it just the world, or is it a certain place in a certain time?
[3379.50 --> 3385.50]  Again, is it the church? Now most of those questions, they're answered a little bit differently,
[3385.50 --> 3390.08]  depending on who you ask, which makes coming up with the symbols of this parable a little bit tricky.
[3390.20 --> 3394.70]  People have been allegorizing this parable since it was spoken, but the problem is, once you try to
[3394.70 --> 3400.88]  attach a specific person or a specific symbol to a specific character in this parable, you often end
[3400.88 --> 3410.02]  up with more questions than answers. However, we can find some clarity in some of the symbols, and at least
[3410.02 --> 3417.18]  in all of the symbols that matter when we look at the rest of Scripture. So in Isaiah 5 verses 1 to 7,
[3417.28 --> 3422.68]  we read about an Old Testament parable that sounds a lot like this one. Basically, and feel free to
[3422.68 --> 3426.82]  turn it to in your Bibles, and you can read it later if you wish, in this Old Testament parable,
[3426.92 --> 3431.98]  there's a vineyard, and it's not producing fruit for the owner. However, in the Old Testament parable,
[3432.28 --> 3437.30]  there's no vine dresser willing to give the vineyard one more year, one more chance, a little bit more
[3437.30 --> 3442.84]  love. And so in Isaiah, the owner simply says he's going to destroy the vineyard. He's going to lay it
[3442.84 --> 3448.72]  to waste, tear down the walls, and make sure that rain will not fall on it. At the end of that parable,
[3448.88 --> 3455.06]  Isaiah decides that there's no need for obfuscation. Verse 7 of that parable says that God is the owner
[3455.06 --> 3462.08]  and Israel is the vineyard. God is going to lay to waste this fruitful nation of his. You see, Israel was
[3462.08 --> 3467.84]  meant to glorify God and reveal him to the nations around, but they didn't do that, and they weren't
[3467.84 --> 3474.30]  doing that, and so Israel was going to be destroyed, which it was when Assyria came rolling to town, and
[3474.30 --> 3481.02]  that's a different sermon. But back to our parable then. Vineyards have represented Israel throughout
[3481.02 --> 3485.94]  the Old Testament, and so the Jewish people who were in this crowd listening to Jesus would have known
[3485.94 --> 3492.34]  the framework that Jesus is setting here. Now, in Isaiah 5, the parable talks about grapes, whereas
[3492.34 --> 3497.82]  here Jesus talks about fig trees. So it's not this perfect parable, or parallel, sorry, but apparently
[3497.82 --> 3502.44]  fig trees were very popular in vineyards back then. They were very strong, sturdy trees, and vines would
[3502.44 --> 3508.34]  be supported by them. It was not uncommon to find lots of fig trees in vineyards. So again, Jesus is
[3508.34 --> 3513.64]  looking at this crowd, this crowd that includes Jews and Pharisees and other people, and he starts talking
[3513.64 --> 3519.38]  about a vineyard that's not producing fruit, or more specifically, he starts talking about a tree
[3519.38 --> 3525.26]  in the vineyard which is not producing fruit. And you know that the Jewish people there are taking
[3525.26 --> 3530.98]  notice. In fact, some of them are going to take that personally. If the vineyard is the whole nation of
[3530.98 --> 3540.68]  Israel, a tree in the vineyard has to be a person, right? But there's more. While that maybe helps paint a
[3540.68 --> 3545.52]  little picture of what Jesus is getting at, to catch sort of the full scope, we need to ask two questions.
[3545.62 --> 3551.70]  We need to ask, why does Jesus tell this parable in the first place? And again, like the prom story, why
[3551.70 --> 3560.34]  doesn't this parable end? Now, the answer to why Jesus is telling us this story comes from the five verses
[3560.34 --> 3566.30]  that precede this text. Before Jesus speaks this parable, this is what's happening and being said. So Luke 13,
[3566.30 --> 3572.12]  one to five says this, now there were some present at that time who told Jesus about the Galileans
[3572.12 --> 3578.60]  whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. Jesus answered, do you think that these Galileans
[3578.60 --> 3584.46]  were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this way? I tell you, no.
[3585.20 --> 3592.20]  But unless you repent, you too will all perish. Or those 18 who died when that tower in Siloam fell on
[3592.20 --> 3598.84]  them? Do you think that they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem? I tell you, no.
[3600.06 --> 3604.10]  But unless you repent, you too will all perish.
[3606.82 --> 3611.44]  And so that's what was happening right before Jesus tells this parable. The people told Jesus that
[3611.44 --> 3618.12]  some people in Galilee were killed by Pilate. And they implied that because they were killed by Pilate in
[3618.12 --> 3622.58]  this tragic sort of gruesome way, they were getting judged for sins that they had committed.
[3623.02 --> 3629.50]  They were implying that they must be worse sinners because they died in this way. And Jesus says, no.
[3630.60 --> 3635.72]  No, they weren't worse. In fact, Jesus doubles down and he brings up another tragedy that happened
[3635.72 --> 3642.24]  close to them in that time. He talks about a tower that fell in Siloam and 18 people died in that tragedy
[3642.24 --> 3648.78]  too. And he says, were they worse sinners? Were they worse than all the other people in Jerusalem
[3648.78 --> 3656.82]  because they died in that tragedy? No, of course not. Jesus goes on to say, and he's speaking to the
[3656.82 --> 3665.10]  whole crowd now. He says, no, unless you repent, you'll all perish. And then he tells the parable.
[3666.28 --> 3671.74]  See, Jesus is cutting through a bit of a myth here, cutting through a worldview that people who die,
[3671.74 --> 3677.42]  who pass away suddenly or tragically, especially in unforeseen ways, they die because God is judging
[3677.42 --> 3684.52]  them for their sins. But that's just not true. If human beings die by random violence or by some
[3684.52 --> 3690.70]  freak accident or by natural disaster, it's not because God has arbitrarily decided to punish them
[3690.70 --> 3697.18]  for their sins while leaving the rest of us alone. No. Jesus says it's not the sins of a man that brings
[3697.18 --> 3707.74]  God's judgment, but the sin of mankind that does, or rather that did. Now, as Pastor Chris would say,
[3708.00 --> 3714.02]  don't hear what I'm not saying. It's a good impression, right? When we sin, our sins have
[3714.02 --> 3720.10]  consequences. If you steal from a store, you may get fined or banned or imprisoned. If you cheat on your
[3720.10 --> 3726.00]  spouse, you might get divorced. If you don't treat your body like a temple, fentanyl can kill you.
[3726.00 --> 3733.80]  Our sins have consequences. Sins can lead to death, but that's an action-reaction that causes death,
[3733.86 --> 3740.18]  not God's judgment. But Jesus isn't talking about the ramifications of our decisions here.
[3740.64 --> 3748.12]  He's saying that if people die suddenly, it's not God's judgment on their sins, ending with an S.
[3748.12 --> 3760.10]  death, all death, is a result of sin, ending in an N. When Adam and Eve ate the fruit, sin became a part
[3760.10 --> 3766.42]  of this world, and death came with it. Now people die, all of us. We will all perish, as Jesus said,
[3766.56 --> 3771.62]  and it isn't our specific individual sins that will cause us death as a result of God's judgment.
[3771.62 --> 3778.36]  We're going to die because sin has entered the world. This is a bummer of a sermon right now.
[3779.62 --> 3785.34]  See, Jesus is getting at the difference between the sins we commit and the overarching sin of the
[3785.34 --> 3794.68]  world. Sins versus sin. The Jews had Jesus looking at the specific sins of these few people,
[3794.68 --> 3799.46]  and they were saying that they must be more sinful than us because they died in that way.
[3800.34 --> 3807.78]  And so their presumed privilege, the Jews' presumed privilege, had them looking to Jesus to acknowledge
[3807.78 --> 3812.32]  the sins of those around them, or in their minds, the sins of those beneath them.
[3813.82 --> 3822.12]  And their resulted arrogance led Jesus to reply with, nah, you're all sinful. You're all going to perish.
[3822.12 --> 3825.70]  Sin is going to cause you to die.
[3828.04 --> 3832.56]  The fall of man happened, and now life is uncertain. Death lurks around the corner,
[3832.92 --> 3835.26]  and judgment for our sin is inevitable.
[3837.26 --> 3839.74]  Essentially, we're all doomed no matter what we do in this world.
[3840.36 --> 3848.56]  Again, what a bummer right now. But don't worry, because it's about to change.
[3849.16 --> 3852.10]  See, it's about to turn because Jesus follows this with this parable.
[3852.12 --> 3858.38]  That we read today. Our eternal lives are not about the things we do, but about what Jesus did,
[3858.72 --> 3864.28]  and about what the vine dresser did. That's why this parable, not ending, is so important.
[3864.74 --> 3869.56]  See, in the Old Testament, the vineyard wasn't producing fruit, and so God was going to destroy it.
[3869.78 --> 3875.34]  Here, though, that's not how this ends. Here, the vine dresser says, hold on, hold on.
[3876.34 --> 3882.66]  Let's do some work here. Don't destroy it yet. Give it a year. I'll dig around it. I'll try to renew it.
[3883.20 --> 3886.32]  Actually, if you read the parable, it says, let me put some manure on it,
[3886.58 --> 3891.14]  which, interestingly, is the only time in the New Testament that that word in the Arabic is used.
[3891.92 --> 3895.66]  Apparently, it's a bit of a play on words by Jesus, and the crowds would have found it amusing.
[3895.80 --> 3899.10]  He was basically saying, if the trees were acting like poops, let's put some better poop on it,
[3899.38 --> 3902.36]  and they would have laughed. See, Jesus had a sense of humor, apparently.
[3902.36 --> 3907.80]  Anyways, the vine dresser says, leave it alone. Leave it alone for one more year. I'll care for it.
[3907.84 --> 3910.36]  I'll nurture it a little bit, and then in a year, let's see if it's fruitful.
[3910.88 --> 3915.76]  If it is, great. If not, we'll cut it down.
[3917.10 --> 3921.20]  And that's the difference between the Old Testament parable and this new one Jesus is telling.
[3921.28 --> 3923.70]  There's a chance for this tree in this parable.
[3923.70 --> 3928.58]  And that chance, notice, does not come from itself.
[3929.36 --> 3934.06]  It's not from the tree doing anything, or the tree trying a little bit harder to grow,
[3934.14 --> 3935.92]  or the tree sinning a little less.
[3936.00 --> 3942.20]  No, the second chance for life for this tree comes from outside,
[3942.82 --> 3945.18]  because that's who Jesus is.
[3946.76 --> 3949.06]  Jesus is that outside help we all need.
[3949.06 --> 3952.48]  Jesus is the one who provides renewal for our lives,
[3952.48 --> 3955.34]  and most importantly, like this parable,
[3955.96 --> 3959.62]  Jesus is the reason our story doesn't end.
[3961.62 --> 3964.86]  See, God saw the sin in the world and knew all would perish,
[3964.98 --> 3967.38]  and so he sent his son, Jesus, into this world,
[3967.74 --> 3972.50]  who Jesus also knew the sin that so easily entangles us all,
[3972.54 --> 3976.88]  and so he lived this righteous life, this perfect life that none of us can live,
[3977.12 --> 3980.04]  none of us have lived, and then, in place of all of us,
[3980.04 --> 3983.80]  in place of you and in place of me, he died the death that we deserve to die.
[3984.74 --> 3988.46]  And he took on the sins of this world, and he took them on the shoulders,
[3989.22 --> 3990.26]  and he died on the cross.
[3991.84 --> 3994.96]  And then three days later, he rose again from the dead,
[3995.00 --> 3997.12]  and he defeated both sin and death,
[3997.14 --> 4001.84]  and now he sits in heaven mediating on our behalf over all things and over all the cosmos,
[4001.84 --> 4007.76]  and he sent his spirit to be with us, to sanctify us, to live in us, and guide us.
[4007.80 --> 4010.68]  And now all who believe in him, in what he has accomplished,
[4010.94 --> 4014.28]  and the work that he did to us are saved from our sins.
[4014.42 --> 4017.00]  If we repent, our sins are forgiven,
[4017.12 --> 4020.12]  so that when we die, we join Jesus in heaven,
[4020.32 --> 4022.34]  and our story continues.
[4023.06 --> 4024.50]  It doesn't end, it goes on.
[4024.50 --> 4027.74]  As Paul says in Thessalonians,
[4028.50 --> 4030.34]  brothers and sisters,
[4031.10 --> 4035.68]  we do not want you to be uninformed about those who sleep in death,
[4036.06 --> 4038.66]  so that you do not grieve like the rest of mankind,
[4039.18 --> 4040.72]  who have no hope.
[4042.22 --> 4045.48]  For we believe that Jesus died and rose again,
[4045.88 --> 4048.42]  and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus
[4048.42 --> 4051.56]  those who have fallen asleep in him.
[4051.56 --> 4053.78]  That's the truth.
[4053.96 --> 4056.72]  That's the truth that we can hold on to from 1 Thessalonians.
[4056.92 --> 4060.60]  That's the truth of Jesus' gospel message to all of us.
[4061.26 --> 4064.94]  And that's the truth of why this parable doesn't end.
[4065.14 --> 4068.24]  Because we have hope in what Jesus has done for us.
[4071.70 --> 4073.26]  Back to the beginning for a second.
[4074.02 --> 4075.06]  Not the prom story.
[4075.46 --> 4077.32]  I can see some of you are still waiting for me to end that one.
[4077.32 --> 4082.34]  No, go back to the beginning about why Jesus told this parable.
[4082.84 --> 4086.64]  The people there went to Jesus telling him of people who had died
[4086.64 --> 4088.94]  and asked if their sins were worse.
[4089.82 --> 4091.72]  And Jesus said, no, your sins are all bad.
[4092.02 --> 4092.92]  You all need saving.
[4093.54 --> 4095.96]  You all need to respond to the vine dresser's work.
[4097.66 --> 4099.40]  And that's the truth for us too.
[4099.40 --> 4103.98]  How will you respond to the vine dresser?
[4104.04 --> 4109.46]  How will you respond to the renewing work of Jesus in your life?
[4110.58 --> 4112.86]  How will you respond in faith?
[4114.48 --> 4115.78]  Jesus has done the work.
[4115.86 --> 4117.24]  Are you producing fruit?
[4117.42 --> 4118.94]  That is the question for us today.
[4119.24 --> 4121.72]  Like the Jews, are we looking around us?
[4122.20 --> 4123.78]  Out our windows at others?
[4123.88 --> 4125.86]  At the sins in the world happening?
[4125.96 --> 4127.16]  Sort of in our periphery?
[4127.16 --> 4130.26]  Are we asking about them and if they will be good enough?
[4130.38 --> 4132.02]  If their sins will go unpunished?
[4132.08 --> 4133.76]  If their sins will be forgiven?
[4133.94 --> 4135.98]  Wondering what God is doing about them?
[4138.22 --> 4139.78]  Or are we looking at ourselves?
[4139.92 --> 4142.24]  At the work he has done in our lives?
[4142.28 --> 4143.68]  Are we responding in faith?
[4144.04 --> 4145.76]  Are we bearing fruit in his name?
[4146.16 --> 4149.48]  You see, we've talked about this a lot over past sermon series,
[4149.60 --> 4153.16]  but we currently are living in a very post-Christian world right now.
[4153.16 --> 4157.10]  Christianity is losing, and actually in many regards,
[4157.20 --> 4160.62]  Christianity has lost any authority in our culture.
[4162.08 --> 4164.52]  Our culture is becoming more and more pagan,
[4164.66 --> 4168.32]  looking to the spiritual world without Jesus to solve their problems.
[4168.66 --> 4171.26]  They are looking to more and more things for hope
[4171.26 --> 4172.94]  that have nothing to do with Christ.
[4172.94 --> 4177.30]  And it's becoming less and less Christian.
[4177.80 --> 4179.40]  And what that does for us
[4179.40 --> 4184.16]  is it can cause us to spend an awful lot of time
[4184.16 --> 4186.32]  looking at the world around us
[4186.32 --> 4190.58]  and thinking they are so much worse than us.
[4191.58 --> 4196.12]  That they aren't living life the right way.
[4196.12 --> 4200.34]  We start sounding like the crowd in this parable,
[4200.44 --> 4202.32]  looking at the sins of the others
[4202.32 --> 4203.58]  and not realizing that maybe,
[4205.18 --> 4206.34]  and I dare say certainly,
[4207.14 --> 4208.66]  we are the tree in this parable.
[4209.92 --> 4210.68]  Because we are.
[4210.86 --> 4212.56]  The tree in this parable is everyone.
[4214.62 --> 4217.64]  We would all perish without the saving grace of Jesus Christ.
[4219.36 --> 4220.24]  But we forget.
[4220.58 --> 4222.56]  We forget to look at our own hearts, our own sin.
[4222.56 --> 4224.98]  We're distracted by the people around us.
[4224.98 --> 4226.54]  We can gossip about people
[4226.54 --> 4228.74]  when we meet up with our friends for coffee.
[4228.92 --> 4231.24]  And if we don't gossip, we sure like to hear the gossip.
[4231.68 --> 4233.86]  We compare our lives with people on social media.
[4233.96 --> 4236.28]  We judge those who are doing things differently than us.
[4236.60 --> 4239.02]  Or we elevate and even maybe slander people
[4239.02 --> 4240.74]  who are doing stuff that we wish we could do.
[4241.64 --> 4243.40]  Or maybe our hearts are moving in a good direction.
[4243.52 --> 4244.72]  Maybe there's empathy or sympathy.
[4245.04 --> 4246.50]  But we find ourselves concerned
[4246.50 --> 4248.80]  for the sins of the people who are close to us.
[4248.98 --> 4250.78]  And our thoughts start becoming consumed
[4250.78 --> 4252.76]  with what they are doing.
[4252.76 --> 4256.12]  So much so that we fail to look at
[4256.12 --> 4257.42]  what are we doing?
[4257.94 --> 4259.04]  How are we living?
[4259.36 --> 4260.66]  What is our response?
[4263.52 --> 4265.02]  The fact is that maybe
[4265.02 --> 4267.36]  it's possible
[4267.36 --> 4271.04]  that we haven't been bearing good fruit either.
[4272.18 --> 4274.86]  That even if the world around us is falling apart,
[4275.02 --> 4276.38]  still maybe we
[4276.38 --> 4279.98]  aren't responding to the vine dresser's work in our lives
[4279.98 --> 4283.76]  because we're too busy looking around us.
[4285.60 --> 4287.54]  It's our job to look at our own hearts
[4287.54 --> 4290.36]  and ask how am I responding to the gospel truth
[4290.36 --> 4293.02]  of the renewing work of Jesus in my own life?
[4293.22 --> 4295.50]  Not only my wife's or my husband's life.
[4295.60 --> 4296.76]  Not only my kid's life.
[4297.00 --> 4298.32]  Not only my friend's life.
[4298.44 --> 4300.16]  Or my neighbor's or my boss's.
[4300.26 --> 4301.62]  Or my brother's or my sister's.
[4301.76 --> 4304.52]  Or that person sitting two or three rows away from me right now.
[4304.52 --> 4306.40]  Your life.
[4307.54 --> 4308.38]  My life.
[4310.88 --> 4312.80]  We will not be able to help our neighbors
[4312.80 --> 4314.68]  if we are not responding ourselves.
[4314.84 --> 4317.90]  We cannot be Jesus' hands and feet in this world
[4317.90 --> 4319.84]  if we're not responding to the gospel truth
[4319.84 --> 4320.96]  of Jesus Christ.
[4321.04 --> 4322.20]  We all must look to our sin
[4322.20 --> 4323.86]  and repent and give our sins
[4323.86 --> 4325.32]  over to Jesus every day.
[4325.68 --> 4327.78]  That is why we have a time of confession
[4327.78 --> 4329.56]  in our services every Sunday.
[4329.56 --> 4330.92]  to repent.
[4331.38 --> 4332.46]  To look into our hearts.
[4333.76 --> 4336.24]  We all need to take a good look at our own lives
[4336.24 --> 4338.44]  because as Jesus says in the lead up to this parable
[4338.44 --> 4339.80]  unless you repent
[4339.80 --> 4344.36]  we cannot live lives of presumed privilege
[4344.36 --> 4345.74]  like the Jews in this story.
[4346.84 --> 4349.38]  We must recognize that we are to come humbly
[4349.38 --> 4350.92]  to the foot of the cross
[4350.92 --> 4352.22]  before Jesus' throne
[4352.22 --> 4353.70]  and ask for forgiveness
[4353.70 --> 4356.38]  and then trust and know
[4356.38 --> 4359.68]  in his gospel truth that we are saved.
[4360.56 --> 4361.74]  Jesus has done the work.
[4363.46 --> 4364.74]  We will not perish.
[4365.60 --> 4366.48]  That's the parable.
[4368.26 --> 4369.96]  Like the tree, our end is near
[4369.96 --> 4371.44]  but our hope is in him.
[4371.82 --> 4373.92]  Renewal has come from outside of us.
[4374.14 --> 4375.06]  It's nothing we did.
[4375.26 --> 4376.36]  It's what Jesus did.
[4377.30 --> 4378.46]  In the vine dresser's work.
[4378.56 --> 4379.58]  This work has been done.
[4379.84 --> 4381.00]  The soil's been dug out.
[4381.28 --> 4382.82]  The renewal is happening.
[4383.30 --> 4384.76]  The manure has been spread.
[4384.76 --> 4384.90]  It's not.
[4387.22 --> 4388.78]  So let's take a deep breath
[4388.78 --> 4391.20]  and know what Jesus has done for us.
[4391.84 --> 4394.42]  Know that if we truly believe in the work of Jesus
[4394.42 --> 4396.16]  our story doesn't end either.
[4396.84 --> 4398.42]  And when we know this truth
[4398.42 --> 4399.96]  we will respond.
[4400.84 --> 4403.84]  We'll respond in humble repentance
[4403.84 --> 4405.88]  and bold faith.
[4407.04 --> 4409.12]  We'll respond by living each day
[4409.12 --> 4410.88]  in such a way that we'll have no fear
[4410.88 --> 4412.62]  in giving account before God
[4412.62 --> 4414.02]  because through our repentance
[4414.02 --> 4415.86]  all our sins are forgiven.
[4417.64 --> 4419.78]  We'll respond by living each day
[4419.78 --> 4421.80]  knowing that Jesus has brought our salvation
[4421.80 --> 4423.28]  because of the gospel truth
[4423.28 --> 4425.54]  of his life and his death and his resurrection.
[4426.92 --> 4429.34]  And we'll respond by living each day
[4429.34 --> 4431.10]  sharing this gospel truth
[4431.10 --> 4433.10]  in word and in deed
[4433.10 --> 4435.00]  in the world around us.
[4435.00 --> 4436.88]  And when we do that
[4436.88 --> 4439.12]  we will bear much fruit for him.
[4439.66 --> 4439.96]  Amen?
[4441.02 --> 4441.78]  Let me pray.
[4445.02 --> 4446.44]  Father God we are so grateful
[4446.44 --> 4447.98]  that our story does not end.
[4449.12 --> 4451.48]  Lord we thank you for what you did
[4451.48 --> 4452.42]  in this world
[4452.42 --> 4453.12]  for your life
[4453.12 --> 4453.72]  your death
[4453.72 --> 4454.76]  and your resurrection
[4454.76 --> 4455.64]  and that we know
[4455.64 --> 4457.16]  that you are constantly
[4457.16 --> 4458.12]  through your Holy Spirit
[4458.12 --> 4459.12]  renewing our hearts
[4459.12 --> 4460.28]  and renewing our minds
[4460.28 --> 4461.96]  sanctifying us
[4461.96 --> 4463.00]  in this world.
[4464.00 --> 4464.74]  And God
[4464.74 --> 4466.46]  may we not be distracted
[4466.46 --> 4469.98]  by those around us
[4469.98 --> 4471.90]  by the sins of the world
[4471.90 --> 4476.00]  or assuming that we have
[4476.00 --> 4477.12]  a higher privilege
[4477.12 --> 4477.98]  than anyone else.
[4479.34 --> 4480.94]  God but may we humbly
[4480.94 --> 4482.38]  submit to you
[4482.38 --> 4483.54]  may we humbly repent
[4483.54 --> 4484.24]  of our sins
[4484.24 --> 4485.74]  and out of that humility
[4485.74 --> 4487.04]  may we step out boldly
[4487.04 --> 4488.54]  to proclaim your truth
[4488.54 --> 4489.52]  your gospel truth
[4489.52 --> 4490.46]  to the world around us.
[4490.46 --> 4492.36]  God give us the courage
[4492.36 --> 4492.90]  the faith
[4492.90 --> 4496.36]  and the moment
[4496.36 --> 4497.42]  to do that well.
[4498.44 --> 4499.34]  We pray this in your son's
[4499.34 --> 4499.92]  precious name.
[4500.08 --> 4500.28]  Amen.
[4510.08 --> 4511.40]  Please stand with us.
[4511.40 --> 4529.04]  Be my guide
[4529.04 --> 4530.80]  God of Abraham
[4530.80 --> 4533.44]  Lead me by your hand
[4533.44 --> 4536.36]  You are strong and wise
[4536.36 --> 4540.44]  I want to trust in you
[4540.44 --> 4542.54]  And in all I do
[4542.54 --> 4545.70]  bring you honor and praise
[4545.70 --> 4549.26]  Oh I love you
[4549.26 --> 4555.00]  Great and mighty King
[4555.00 --> 4557.64]  You are faithful
[4557.64 --> 4562.16]  Through the ages
[4562.16 --> 4565.54]  You never change
[4565.54 --> 4570.96]  Be my guide
[4570.96 --> 4572.96]  In the dark of night
[4572.96 --> 4575.18]  Settle fears to flight
[4575.18 --> 4577.76]  You are hope and truth
[4577.76 --> 4582.26]  I want to trust in you
[4582.26 --> 4584.42]  And in all I do
[4584.42 --> 4584.44]  And in all I do
[4584.44 --> 4587.72]  Bring you honor and praise
[4587.72 --> 4591.16]  How I love you
[4591.16 --> 4596.78]  Great and mighty King
[4596.78 --> 4599.32]  You are faithful
[4599.32 --> 4603.84]  Through the ages
[4603.84 --> 4603.96]  Through the ages
[4603.96 --> 4607.26]  You never change
[4607.26 --> 4612.56]  Be my guide
[4612.56 --> 4614.62]  For the road ahead
[4614.62 --> 4616.96]  And should I feel misled
[4616.96 --> 4620.04]  You are just and good
[4620.04 --> 4624.00]  I want to trust in you
[4624.00 --> 4624.06]  I want to trust in you
[4624.06 --> 4626.16]  And in all I do
[4626.16 --> 4629.46]  Bring you honor and praise
[4629.46 --> 4633.44]  How I love you
[4633.44 --> 4638.64]  Great and mighty King
[4638.64 --> 4641.20]  You are faithful
[4641.20 --> 4645.88]  Through the ages
[4645.88 --> 4648.28]  You never change
[4648.28 --> 4651.32]  How I love you
[4651.32 --> 4657.18]  Great and mighty King
[4657.18 --> 4659.82]  You are faithful
[4659.82 --> 4664.16]  Through the ages
[4664.16 --> 4668.12]  You never change
[4668.12 --> 4678.50]  And so this guy
[4678.50 --> 4679.88]  Waited in a long line
[4679.88 --> 4680.58]  For his tux
[4680.58 --> 4681.38]  And a long line
[4681.38 --> 4682.00]  For his shoes
[4682.00 --> 4682.86]  And a long line
[4682.86 --> 4683.56]  For his flowers
[4683.56 --> 4684.40]  And his limo
[4684.40 --> 4685.02]  And the prom
[4685.02 --> 4685.50]  And then he gets
[4685.50 --> 4686.62]  Into prom with his date
[4686.62 --> 4687.74]  And his date wants some food
[4687.74 --> 4688.70]  And he goes to get her food
[4688.70 --> 4689.90]  And there's this long line
[4689.90 --> 4690.42]  For food
[4690.42 --> 4691.06]  And he has to wait
[4691.06 --> 4691.50]  For the food
[4691.50 --> 4692.18]  And wait for the food
[4692.18 --> 4693.64]  And then his date
[4693.64 --> 4694.28]  Wants some punch
[4694.28 --> 4695.24]  And he goes to get some punch
[4695.24 --> 4696.00]  And there's no punch line
[4696.00 --> 4700.84]  That is a joke
[4700.84 --> 4701.68]  If you find yourself
[4701.68 --> 4702.50]  MCing something
[4702.50 --> 4703.24]  Or needing to kill
[4703.24 --> 4704.24]  Like 15 minutes
[4704.24 --> 4705.36]  You can just
[4705.36 --> 4706.68]  He can wait in a long line
[4706.68 --> 4707.90]  For a lot of stuff
[4707.90 --> 4709.22]  And then at the end
[4709.22 --> 4710.00]  You drop the punch line
[4710.00 --> 4712.60]  As we leave this place
[4712.60 --> 4714.14]  And as we go into this week
[4714.14 --> 4715.30]  Let us remember
[4715.30 --> 4716.60]  That we belong
[4716.60 --> 4717.44]  Both body and soul
[4717.44 --> 4718.32]  To Jesus Christ
[4718.32 --> 4719.10]  And that he has come
[4719.10 --> 4719.80]  To renew us
[4719.80 --> 4721.20]  And that we can repent
[4721.20 --> 4721.74]  Of our sins
[4721.74 --> 4722.44]  And we are forgiven
[4722.44 --> 4723.30]  In his name
[4723.30 --> 4724.64]  Because of what he has done
[4724.64 --> 4725.62]  On the cross
[4725.62 --> 4726.36]  So let us go
[4726.36 --> 4728.90]  And proclaim this truth boldly
[4728.90 --> 4730.22]  And please go
[4730.22 --> 4731.22]  With the parting blessing
[4731.22 --> 4732.28]  Found in number six
[4732.28 --> 4734.04]  The Lord bless you
[4734.04 --> 4734.92]  And keep you
[4734.92 --> 4736.64]  The Lord make his face
[4736.64 --> 4737.54]  Shine upon you
[4737.54 --> 4738.66]  And be gracious to you
[4738.66 --> 4740.44]  The Lord turn his face
[4740.44 --> 4741.12]  Toward you
[4741.12 --> 4743.06]  And give you his peace
[4743.06 --> 4744.64]  And all God's people said
[4744.64 --> 4745.90]  Amen
[4745.90 --> 4769.56]  Sing a song of celebration
[4769.56 --> 4773.30]  Lift up a shout of praise
[4773.30 --> 4776.30]  For the bridegroom will come
[4776.30 --> 4780.30]  The glorious one
[4780.30 --> 4785.48]  And oh
[4785.48 --> 4790.12]  We will look on his face
[4790.12 --> 4794.72]  We'll go
[4794.72 --> 4800.60]  To a much better place
[4800.60 --> 4806.24]  Dance with all your might
[4806.24 --> 4808.70]  Lift up your hands
[4808.70 --> 4810.88]  And clap for joy
[4810.88 --> 4813.78]  The time's drawing near
[4813.78 --> 4818.38]  When he will appear
[4818.38 --> 4819.38]  When he will appear
[4819.38 --> 4822.52]  And oh
[4822.52 --> 4828.52]  We'll stand by his side
[4828.52 --> 4832.38]  A strong
[4832.38 --> 4836.88]  Your spotless pride
[4836.88 --> 4842.48]  We will dance
[4842.48 --> 4843.20]  On the streets
[4843.20 --> 4844.52]  That are golden
[4844.52 --> 4847.16]  The glorious bride
[4847.16 --> 4849.04]  And the great son of man
[4849.04 --> 4851.72]  From every tongue
[4851.72 --> 4852.96]  And tribe
[4852.96 --> 4853.80]  And nation
[4853.80 --> 4855.20]  Will join
[4855.20 --> 4859.88]  In the song of the Lamb
[4859.88 --> 4864.88]  Sing aloud
[4864.88 --> 4865.54]  Sing aloud
[4865.54 --> 4866.90]  For the time
[4866.90 --> 4869.10]  Of rejoicing is near
[4869.10 --> 4869.88]  Sing aloud
[4869.88 --> 4870.88]  For the time
[4870.88 --> 4872.68]  Of rejoicing is near
[4872.68 --> 4875.04]  The risen King
[4875.04 --> 4875.88]  Our groom
[4875.88 --> 4878.32]  Is soon to appear
[4878.32 --> 4879.00]  The risen King
[4879.00 --> 4879.88]  Our groom
[4879.88 --> 4880.88]  Is soon to appear
[4880.88 --> 4884.36]  The wedding feast
[4884.36 --> 4884.88]  To come
[4885.64 --> 4888.36]  Is now near at hand
[4888.36 --> 4893.76]  Lift up your voice
[4893.76 --> 4897.04]  Proclaim the coming land
[4897.04 --> 4898.50]  Lift up your voice
[4898.50 --> 4901.36]  Proclaim the coming land
[4901.36 --> 4904.76]  We will dance
[4904.76 --> 4907.76]  On the streets
[4907.76 --> 4908.76]  That are golden
[4908.76 --> 4911.76]  The glorious bride
[4911.76 --> 4913.40]  And the great son of man
[4913.40 --> 4918.68]  We will dance
[4918.68 --> 4920.64]  On the streets
[4920.64 --> 4922.84]  That are golden
[4922.84 --> 4924.68]  The glorious bride
[4924.68 --> 4927.34]  And the great son of man
[4927.34 --> 4930.00]  From every tongue
[4930.00 --> 4931.00]  And tribe
[4931.00 --> 4932.00]  And nation
[4932.00 --> 4933.40]  Will join
[4933.40 --> 4936.56]  In the song
[4936.56 --> 4937.00]  Of the
[4937.00 --> 4939.04]  We will dance
[4939.04 --> 4939.82]  On the streets
[4939.82 --> 4941.10]  That are golden
