[613.46 --> 620.22]  my name is chris i'm one of the pastors on staff here and it's our pleasure to lead you
[620.22 --> 625.82]  in worship this morning before we begin in earnest there's a couple announcements that
[625.82 --> 633.96]  need to be made first of all a number of you actually so many of you have responded
[633.96 --> 643.90]  in extraordinary ways to the fundraiser that the gems girls are doing they have sold over 600
[643.90 --> 656.00]  jars of cookie recipes yeah that's amazing um but if i remember correctly that means we need 30 more
[656.00 --> 658.18]  dozen jars
[658.18 --> 668.02]  did i stress the anxiousness of the planners a little bit enough in there so if you are able to help
[668.02 --> 676.16]  provide uh court-sized jars um we asked originally for wide mouth uh we may have cleaned langley out of
[676.16 --> 683.72]  wide mouth court-sized jars so we're adjusting if you're able to provide a dozen or so or however many
[683.72 --> 692.12]  you can of those please do so before this wednesday and then maybe connect with rachel and nikki ladies
[692.12 --> 696.54]  can you raise your hands there you go connect with them tell them that you're able to do that
[696.54 --> 705.32]  so that they know exactly how many they might need to buy to fill up the missing number as well
[705.32 --> 711.90]  if you are able to help with the setup or the assembly that the gems girls are going to do that's
[711.90 --> 717.88]  going to happen on december 1st which is the thursday night of gems they're going to put all those

[724.34 --> 729.86]  instance that has to be like sifted and separated and so it's it's going to be a thing and they need
[729.86 --> 735.92]  some help and so again please talk to rachel and nikki if that's something that you can do

[738.72 --> 748.20]  just help please just help and then also thank you that's amazing and it's awesome to
[748.20 --> 754.64]  see the gems girls supported in that way as well i want to bring your attention to
[754.64 --> 764.62]  the not a new thing but a renewed thing we are restarting relaunching prayer ministry here
[764.62 --> 770.54]  to take place during worship to have people available for someone to go back and connect
[770.54 --> 776.64]  in prayer and during lord's supper to have people available for that and so we are currently working
[776.64 --> 783.80]  on surrounding the leader arlene has agreed to be the leader there and surrounding her with a team
[783.80 --> 788.00]  of people we've reached out to a number already but if that's something that you are interested in
[788.00 --> 794.66]  participating in the commitment is once every couple months if we get a big enough team in there
[794.66 --> 799.86]  and then you just sort of hang out and let people approach you and you pray with them you meet with
[799.86 --> 805.12]  them in their need we're really excited about the opportunity to relaunch this here in our midst and so
[805.12 --> 810.76]  if that's something that you are interested in participating in grab me or talk to arlene arlene are you

[844.60 --> 852.28]  and months we've noticed and experienced a lot of guests in our midst a lot of people checking us out
[852.28 --> 858.58]  for the first time or coming back regularly and so we wanted to welcome you and offer you a chance to
[858.58 --> 865.00]  connect more formally and in covenant relationship with us and so beginning on december 5th we're going

[878.04 --> 883.36]  and so december 5th will be a new members class where you can ask any questions we can sort of outline
[883.36 --> 890.12]  what this looks like to covenant together to partner together in our ministry with god in the community
[890.12 --> 895.88]  here and so if you have any questions about that you can also grab me after the service i believe

[1443.80 --> 1460.32]  You are holy, holy, Lord of heaven and blue, Lord of heaven and blue.
[1460.32 --> 1463.12]  and
[1476.80 --> 1483.12]  us
[1483.12 --> 1489.92]  You are holy, holy
[1489.92 --> 1494.80]  Yes, you are in your heart to me
[1494.80 --> 1501.34]  You are holy, holy
[1501.34 --> 1513.10]  You are holy, holy
[1513.12 --> 1524.12]  You are holy, holy
[1524.12 --> 1528.18]  Heaven and heaven
[1528.18 --> 1535.12]  Lord of heaven and heaven
[1543.12 --> 1546.46]  Our confession comes to us this morning from Proverbs 30
[1546.46 --> 1550.28]  Where it says, two things I ask of you, Lord
[1550.28 --> 1552.86]  Do not refuse me before I die
[1552.86 --> 1556.74]  Keep falsehood and lies far from me
[1556.74 --> 1559.84]  Give me neither poverty nor riches
[1559.84 --> 1562.48]  But give me only my daily bread
[1562.48 --> 1566.22]  Otherwise I may have too much and disown you
[1566.22 --> 1567.80]  And say, who is the Lord?
[1568.88 --> 1570.90]  Or I may become poor and steal
[1570.90 --> 1573.38]  And so dishonor the name of my God
[1573.38 --> 1577.84]  You know, if I'm honest with myself
[1577.84 --> 1581.12]  Asking God for neither poverty or riches scares me
[1581.12 --> 1584.10]  I know in my head it's the right answer
[1584.10 --> 1585.42]  And it's the right thing to say
[1585.42 --> 1589.78]  But my old self wants more than my daily needs
[1589.78 --> 1591.58]  I want to be comfortable
[1591.58 --> 1594.78]  I want comfort to be important, right?
[1596.20 --> 1597.82]  When I hear myself saying that
[1597.82 --> 1600.78]  I recognize that pursuing life's comforts
[1601.44 --> 1603.74]  Making that my passion
[1603.74 --> 1605.90]  Could lead me away from the Lord
[1605.90 --> 1608.64]  Replacing him as the center of my life
[1608.64 --> 1609.88]  Let's pray
[1609.88 --> 1614.04]  Father
[1614.04 --> 1618.52]  Forgive our inclination to be selfish
[1618.52 --> 1621.20]  And to want more for ourselves
[1621.20 --> 1624.26]  Forgive us for trying to manipulate you
[1624.26 --> 1626.54]  Into doing our bidding for our comfort
[1626.54 --> 1631.16]  Lord, take your rightful place in our lives
[1631.16 --> 1633.22]  And teach us to be content
[1633.22 --> 1637.98]  Help us to enjoy resting in what you daily provide us
[1637.98 --> 1640.62]  Captivate us with your beauty
[1640.62 --> 1644.46]  May your glory shine as we continue to worship you today
[1644.46 --> 1645.58]  Amen
[1645.58 --> 1649.20]  Rise and sing this last song

[1772.76 --> 1778.76]  By sin thy glory may not see
[1778.76 --> 1786.60]  Only thou art holy
[1786.60 --> 1791.60]  There is none beside thee

[2088.76 --> 2095.70]  You are my everything, and I will adore you.
[2095.70 --> 2105.74]  Holy, holy, holy, the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is and is to come.
[2107.86 --> 2113.36]  All creation I sing, praise to the King of kings.
[2114.36 --> 2119.66]  You are my everything, and I will adore you.
[2125.70 --> 2139.72]  All creation I sing, praise to the King.
[2139.72 --> 2139.80]  Amen.
[2139.80 --> 2167.68]  We are a moment, you are a moment, but our vision, that we go to earth.
[2167.68 --> 2183.78]  We are a moment, you are eternal, love and mercy, reigning on us.
[2183.78 --> 2197.62]  Glory, holy, Lord God Almighty, worthy is the Lamb of the Lamb.
[2197.62 --> 2203.62]  God has raised us, and now we are glory.

[2211.62 --> 2217.62]  We are true, O Lord, we are the nearer.
[2217.62 --> 2224.62]  We are the broken, you are the nearer.
[2224.62 --> 2231.62]  Jesus, redeemer, I need you to save.
[2231.62 --> 2238.62]  You are the love song, we'll sing forever.
[2238.62 --> 2248.62]  We are the broken, you are the nearer.
[2248.62 --> 2260.62]  Glory, holy, Lord God Almighty, worthy is the Lamb of the Lamb.
[2260.62 --> 2270.62]  We are the broken, you are the nearer.
[2270.62 --> 2281.62]  We are the broken, you are the nearer.
[2281.62 --> 2294.62]  Glory, holy, Lord God Almighty, worthy is the Lamb of the world's sin.
[2294.62 --> 2307.62]  Highest praises, honor, and glory be unto your name.
[2307.62 --> 2315.62]  Be unto your name.
[2315.62 --> 2335.62]  Good morning.
[2335.62 --> 2339.62]  My name is Brenda, and I am one of the deacons here at Emmanuel.
[2339.62 --> 2346.62]  We continue our worship with the giving of our gifts to the budget, which covers the administration of the church and its ministries.
[2346.62 --> 2353.62]  And our special offering this morning is to UBCO Campus Reformed Okanagan.
[2353.62 --> 2357.62]  This is formerly called Wellspring UBCO.
[2357.62 --> 2362.62]  It's the chaplaincy of the UBC Campus Okanagan.
[2362.62 --> 2367.62]  Embracing students, faculty, and staff in intentional community,
[2367.62 --> 2372.62]  campus chaplaincies engage their campuses, bringing the gospel in word and deed.
[2372.62 --> 2379.62]  Campus chaplains are there to facilitate faith formation, worship, and gospel proclamation,
[2379.62 --> 2384.62]  servant leadership, global mission, mercy, and justice.
[2384.62 --> 2389.62]  Chaplains are supportive listeners who are on campus to support campus well-being
[2389.62 --> 2393.62]  and encourage students, faculty, and staff on their spiritual journey.
[2393.62 --> 2400.62]  Kelowna CRC supports and is in partnership with this ministry on the UBCO Campus.
[2400.62 --> 2403.62]  This ministry is led by Dr. Todd Statham.
[2403.62 --> 2409.62]  He loves to explore with students and faculty how all things, what we study, what we research,
[2409.62 --> 2413.62]  what we imagine and hope, how they hold together in Christ.
[2413.62 --> 2419.62]  He seeks to equip and encourage students, staff, and faculty to be lifelong disciples of Jesus.
[2419.62 --> 2428.62]  2 Corinthians 9, verse 6 to 8 says,
[2428.62 --> 2435.62]  Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously.
[2435.62 --> 2441.62]  Each of you can give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion,
[2441.62 --> 2443.62]  for God loves a cheerful giver.
[2443.62 --> 2449.62]  And God is able to bless you abundantly, so that in all things, at all times, having all that you need,
[2449.62 --> 2451.62]  you will abound in every good work.
[2451.62 --> 2459.62]  The song that we're going to sing during the offering is the song we've chosen for Advent.
[2459.62 --> 2463.62]  So we'll sing it throughout the Advent season, and we thought we'd introduce it to you this morning,
[2463.62 --> 2467.62]  so it's all familiar a little bit next week when Advent begins.
[2467.62 --> 2475.62]  We'll sing it in on the Kashmir Atkinson to sing the beginning.

[2490.62 --> 2494.62]  The pockets of Jesus' home implicitly have the connection processes
[2494.62 --> 2495.62]  Amen.
[2524.62 --> 2525.62]  Amen.
[2554.62 --> 2556.62]  Amen.
[2584.62 --> 2586.62]  Amen.
[2614.62 --> 2616.62]  Amen.
[2644.62 --> 2646.62]  Amen.
[2674.62 --> 2676.92]  Let's go to grade four to the front for a quick hello.
[2676.92 --> 2677.92]  Oh my goodness.
[2677.92 --> 2681.38]  I almost couldn't get up here you guys are so busy rushing the aisles.
[2683.12 --> 2684.52]  It's good to see so many of you.
[2684.52 --> 2687.62]  I was a little worried some people might be home sick.
[2687.62 --> 2690.62]  We probably have a few sick friends from school and stuff.
[2690.62 --> 2692.62]  Hey, but good to have you guys here today.
[2692.62 --> 2696.32]  Do you guys remember what we've been learning about in children's worship time?
[2696.32 --> 2698.32]  What Hayley?
[2698.32 --> 2701.32]  Some big ideas.
[2701.32 --> 2703.32]  I know it's tricky.
[2703.32 --> 2710.76]  Trust. Trust. And who was the character we learned about last week? His name was Abram, right?
[2711.32 --> 2717.50]  And what did he get renamed? Abraham. Yeah, he got a new name, and that means father of many,
[2717.74 --> 2725.44]  right? Yeah, huge, huge thing that he had to trust God for a really, really big promise. So we're
[2725.44 --> 2731.42]  going to talk about promises today in Children's Rural Time, but I won't ask you here to confess
[2731.42 --> 2736.70]  any big promises you've made or ones maybe you've broken. Okay, we won't do that here. We'll have a
[2736.70 --> 2740.58]  little chat and watch some videos and have an activity in Children's Worship Time. But before
[2740.58 --> 2746.92]  we do that, let's bless our moms and dads and brothers and sisters as they stay here to hear
[2746.92 --> 2754.80]  a bigger message, and they will bless us in return, I think. Ready, guys? The Lord be with you.
[2755.38 --> 2758.26]  All right, let's go to Children's Worship Time.
[2761.42 --> 2765.96]  All right.
[2791.42 --> 2807.74]  Lord, we come to you in prayer this morning. Truly, my soul finds rest in God. My salvation
[2807.74 --> 2814.72]  comes from him. Truly, he is my rock and my salvation. In my fortress, I will not be shaken.
[2814.72 --> 2821.14]  Our merciful Father in heaven, we thank you for providing faithful and gifted pastors, elders,
[2821.34 --> 2826.56]  and deacons here at Emmanuel. Continue to fill them with your wisdom and grant them strength.
[2827.40 --> 2834.08]  Make them faithful workers in your vineyard. This week, our elders will be meeting on Tuesday.
[2834.56 --> 2839.90]  Bless them in this meeting. Also this week, we pray for a blessing over our congregational meeting
[2839.90 --> 2847.66]  on Wednesday. Lord, at this time of year, we begin to travel abroad on our roads and start to become
[2847.66 --> 2852.10]  more dangerous with the cooler weather. We think of the students in the local schools who are traveling
[2852.10 --> 2857.08]  for provincials. Keep those teams safe in their playing and in their driving to and from the
[2857.08 --> 2864.14]  provincials. This is the time of year when the colds and flus affect many. Please comfort and heal
[2864.14 --> 2870.72]  those in need of your healing power. We also think of Harry Baumann as he's undergoing surgery on Monday
[2870.72 --> 2876.24]  morning to reset the previously broken bones in his left elbow. We pray that the surgeons will be
[2876.24 --> 2883.60]  able to fix his arm and that his recovery goes well. We also pray for Robin as she continues to help
[2883.60 --> 2890.72]  Harry in his recovery. We pray for many people in our congregation who are dealing with all sorts of
[2890.72 --> 2897.78]  stress. Stress of finding work, stress of finding accommodations for housing, awaiting test results,
[2898.72 --> 2905.00]  awaiting just simply awaiting. We ask for your comfort, Lord. As many of us in this congregation
[2905.00 --> 2911.20]  have been dealing with lost as loved ones recently or long ago, Lord, it's always can be a difficult time.
[2912.26 --> 2917.20]  Lord, we pray that you prepare us for the upcoming Advent seasons and the next weekend.
[2917.20 --> 2923.60]  May you bless us and go throughout this week and be grounded and rooted in your word.
[2924.10 --> 2926.00]  In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[2947.20 --> 2960.82]  If you have been with us for the last number of weeks, we have been in a series in the book of Psalms,
[2960.98 --> 2969.50]  primarily a particular few Psalms, a series that we have called Faith and All Our Feelings. And through
[2969.50 --> 2976.18]  that we have looked at the mix of our emotions and feelings and the sorts of reactions and the
[2976.18 --> 2982.88]  emotional realities that surround them. And we've been doing that through the lens of a number of
[2982.88 --> 2989.54]  key Psalms, as well as with the aid of a book called The Cry of the Soul by Allender and Longman.
[2991.12 --> 2999.80]  This morning is the final teaching in that series. Now, normally when we begin a teaching,
[2999.80 --> 3006.64]  when we have a message up here, we start with a little bit of an explanation perhaps, but then we,
[3006.82 --> 3015.58]  at the beginning, read a text that we then explain and apply. Today, however, we're going to do that a
[3015.58 --> 3020.54]  little bit differently. And so if you have your Bibles with you and you've already turned to Psalm
[3020.54 --> 3028.44]  100 because you know that's where we're going, excellent work. Hang on to it. The text is going to
[3028.44 --> 3035.36]  come at the end. Okay, so we're going to build to what the text says for us and then we will let
[3035.36 --> 3043.80]  that sort of culminate our journey this morning. Now, that said, I do want to give a bit of a road
[3043.80 --> 3052.44]  map for where we're going and maybe a little bit of direction for how we might get there. What I hope
[3052.44 --> 3061.12]  that we will see together this morning at the end is that the end of this journey of faith and feelings,
[3061.50 --> 3071.98]  the purpose of all of this together, is found in this idea that the purpose of redeemed humanity
[3071.98 --> 3090.44]  is found in praise and thanksgiving to God. Or to put it another way, the way that the Westminster
[3090.44 --> 3097.14]  Shorter Catechism summarizes it, the Westminster Shorter Catechism is a confessional and historical
[3097.14 --> 3103.16]  statement of faith from the Presbyterian branch of the Reformed Church. And in the Shorter Catechism,
[3103.26 --> 3111.82]  it begins with this question. It asks, what is the chief end of humanity? What is our purpose? What is
[3111.82 --> 3119.92]  our goal? Where are we going? And how are we going to get there? Why are we here? Now, the answer that
[3119.92 --> 3130.30]  that catechism gives is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever. The chief end of humanity, the telos,
[3130.46 --> 3139.52]  the reason for which we were created, is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever. But especially if you've
[3139.52 --> 3148.26]  been with us these last couple weeks, we know and have been living in the reality that there are certain
[3148.26 --> 3157.58]  things or circumstances or situations that seem to rob us, that seem to remove that end from being
[3157.58 --> 3165.24]  realistic or at least expressive. It seems to stop us from getting there, right? To wall us off from the
[3165.24 --> 3171.56]  experience of the truth of God and applying the truth of who God is to the everyday stuff of our life,
[3171.56 --> 3181.28]  sometimes the sorts of things that we feel and experience seem to be a barrier to accessing or
[3181.28 --> 3190.64]  encountering God. And our work for these last number of weeks has been to, in some ways, reimagine or
[3190.64 --> 3198.46]  reframe the relationship between faith and feelings that allows the depths of our feelings to be
[3198.46 --> 3205.62]  impacted by the depths and the scope of God's presence and His Spirit in our midst.
[3207.70 --> 3215.26]  And I don't know about you, but as we've explored some of these emotional realities together,
[3216.10 --> 3225.66]  we've seen hard things, we've remembered hard things, we've felt hard things, right? We've remembered
[3225.66 --> 3235.16]  and felt truly awful things. We've pierced the dark corners of our emotions and we have tried to find
[3235.16 --> 3241.98]  God in the midst of our anger and our shame, in the midst of our fear and our despair, right? Our souls
[3241.98 --> 3249.32]  have cried out at the seeming impossibility of it all and at the injustice of it all. And throughout
[3249.32 --> 3258.34]  that entire experience and expression and reality lived together, we have tried to hold on to the truth
[3258.34 --> 3267.02]  that God holds on to us. That somehow in the midst of all of that, He is present, that He is active,
[3267.02 --> 3276.62]  and that He somehow is always in control. That is, that He is always sovereign.
[3278.36 --> 3287.28]  And holding the sovereign power of God over history and the sovereign power of God over the hairs on my
[3287.28 --> 3292.46]  head, right? So that is not just in the big things and the big movements and sweeping motions of history,
[3292.46 --> 3298.38]  but in the little things and the tiny things, right? Holding that truth of who God is in one hand,
[3298.66 --> 3309.14]  and then holding the reality lived, the heartbreak of everyday life, creates in our experience,
[3309.48 --> 3317.58]  almost paradoxical tension. One that Pastor Kevin helped us see that maybe our job is to
[3317.58 --> 3327.04]  live in the midst of more than try to solve. Where we found ourselves staring face long into this hard
[3327.04 --> 3336.98]  truth. One that I want to state here, say here explicitly, but I'm realizing that when I say that,
[3337.28 --> 3343.54]  it might offend some of you. And what I'm quite sure is that when I say what I'm about to say,
[3343.54 --> 3350.14]  that some of you are going to think it's heresy. And some of you are going to want to get me in
[3350.14 --> 3354.82]  trouble with the denominational authorities. I want to acknowledge that
[3354.82 --> 3364.52]  if what I say next offends you, that might be because your view of God is more therapeutic
[3364.52 --> 3373.02]  than it is transcendent. But please give me some patience and let's dig in together. Because here it is.
[3373.54 --> 3378.60]  Sometimes God hurts us.
[3383.14 --> 3388.28]  Sometimes God hurts us intentionally.
[3391.28 --> 3398.56]  Now the old Puritans used to call this the severe mercy of God. Now before we dig in, don't hear what
[3398.56 --> 3403.38]  I'm not saying. Okay? Because I know some of you are triggered right now. Right? This doesn't mean
[3403.38 --> 3409.68]  that all pain comes from God. Right? The devil, for one, is real and he is active. Although I do want
[3409.68 --> 3414.10]  to say that the devil's not under every stone or behind every cancer, like some people might say.
[3418.42 --> 3420.06]  But when we wrestle in this moment,
[3420.06 --> 3422.30]  we inevitably ask the question,
[3422.30 --> 3425.00]  is the death of my child
[3425.00 --> 3426.78]  a punishment from God?
[3428.22 --> 3429.18]  And we'll say, no,
[3429.38 --> 3431.82]  not likely. In fact, I will say with
[3431.82 --> 3434.06]  conviction and confidence that if you are a Christian,
[3434.44 --> 3436.48]  I can guarantee you that your suffering,
[3436.60 --> 3438.14]  whatever it may be, whatever form
[3438.14 --> 3440.40]  it takes, is not a punishment
[3440.40 --> 3441.56]  for your sin.
[3442.70 --> 3443.68]  Let me say that again.
[3443.92 --> 3446.24]  Whatever suffering you face, if you are a believer,
[3446.36 --> 3447.74]  is not a punishment for your sin.
[3447.74 --> 3450.02]  Because we believe that Jesus on the cross
[3450.02 --> 3451.66]  bore the full punishment
[3451.66 --> 3452.98]  for all our sins.
[3453.64 --> 3455.76]  That's what Romans 8 verse 1 means
[3455.76 --> 3457.14]  when Paul says,
[3457.36 --> 3459.06]  there is now no condemnation
[3459.06 --> 3460.70]  for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[3460.90 --> 3462.60]  Right? No condemnation means
[3462.60 --> 3464.98]  no judgment, no punishment.
[3465.14 --> 3466.92]  That Jesus has already borne
[3466.92 --> 3468.38]  the punishment for your sins
[3468.38 --> 3469.44]  if you believe.
[3472.46 --> 3473.84]  And so then we start to wonder,
[3473.96 --> 3474.96]  well, if it's not punishment,
[3475.90 --> 3476.94]  is this the work of the devil?
[3478.08 --> 3478.48]  Maybe.
[3479.44 --> 3480.54]  If it's not punishment
[3480.54 --> 3481.80]  and not the work of the devil,
[3482.18 --> 3483.52]  is it the result of sin
[3483.52 --> 3484.38]  in a broken world
[3484.38 --> 3485.88]  now full of tragic accidents
[3485.88 --> 3486.86]  and unfair causes?
[3487.30 --> 3487.66]  Probably.
[3488.64 --> 3490.34]  But that doesn't solve the question.
[3490.94 --> 3491.06]  Right?
[3491.10 --> 3493.48]  That doesn't answer the dilemma for us
[3493.48 --> 3494.62]  because we're still left with it.
[3494.66 --> 3495.72]  And it's the same question
[3495.72 --> 3496.90]  that Job asked
[3496.90 --> 3498.38]  in the midst of all of his struggling
[3498.38 --> 3500.10]  with God and with the devil
[3500.10 --> 3501.42]  and with the reality of evil
[3501.42 --> 3502.00]  in the world.
[3502.36 --> 3502.46]  Right?
[3502.56 --> 3503.04]  Job said,
[3503.36 --> 3505.70]  shall we accept good from God
[3505.70 --> 3507.04]  and not trouble?
[3507.74 --> 3513.80]  Sometimes God hurts us.
[3514.62 --> 3515.94]  To put it another way,
[3516.78 --> 3516.90]  right,
[3517.22 --> 3518.36]  do we believe
[3518.36 --> 3520.28]  what the Heidelberg Catechism says
[3520.28 --> 3522.18]  is the proper understanding
[3522.18 --> 3524.36]  of the doctrine of providence?
[3525.16 --> 3525.40]  Right?
[3525.44 --> 3527.64]  If sovereignty is God's big rule
[3527.64 --> 3529.24]  and reign over the world
[3529.24 --> 3530.56]  such that nothing happens
[3530.56 --> 3531.40]  without his will,
[3531.40 --> 3534.12]  providence is God's intimate action
[3534.12 --> 3535.28]  in your life.
[3536.22 --> 3536.36]  Right?
[3536.46 --> 3537.82]  Providence is God's sovereignty
[3537.82 --> 3539.02]  made real.
[3539.12 --> 3540.02]  And in the Catechism,
[3540.78 --> 3541.48]  it asks,
[3541.84 --> 3542.50]  what do you believe
[3542.50 --> 3543.88]  concerning the providence of God?
[3543.92 --> 3544.82]  And the answer it gives,
[3544.86 --> 3546.22]  and this is a quick summary,
[3546.90 --> 3548.22]  that rain and drought,
[3548.90 --> 3550.60]  fruitful and lean years,
[3550.74 --> 3551.90]  health and sickness,
[3552.24 --> 3554.10]  prosperity and poverty,
[3554.50 --> 3555.42]  beautiful prayer,
[3555.78 --> 3555.98]  Pete.
[3555.98 --> 3558.34]  prosperity and poverty,
[3558.66 --> 3559.42]  all things,
[3559.56 --> 3559.96]  in fact,
[3560.04 --> 3560.70]  come to us
[3560.70 --> 3561.90]  not by chance
[3561.90 --> 3564.08]  but by His
[3564.08 --> 3565.30]  fatherly
[3565.30 --> 3566.32]  hand.
[3568.50 --> 3568.66]  Right?
[3568.70 --> 3570.18]  Whatever the immediate cause
[3570.18 --> 3570.64]  may be,
[3570.72 --> 3571.36]  the truth is,
[3571.40 --> 3572.48]  because God is sovereign,
[3572.64 --> 3573.98]  and can I be bold with you again,
[3574.18 --> 3574.30]  right,
[3574.44 --> 3576.00]  He must be sovereign.
[3577.04 --> 3577.56]  Right?
[3577.56 --> 3578.82]  Because God is sovereign,
[3579.00 --> 3579.92]  all suffering
[3579.92 --> 3581.34]  is brought about
[3581.34 --> 3582.18]  or used by
[3582.18 --> 3582.90]  or permitted
[3582.90 --> 3583.90]  for some
[3583.90 --> 3586.12]  larger purpose.
[3586.72 --> 3587.66]  Your suffering,
[3587.80 --> 3589.02]  no matter how tragic,
[3589.44 --> 3591.00]  does not surprise God.
[3592.04 --> 3593.52]  It does not surprise God
[3593.52 --> 3594.78]  and it does not spoil
[3594.78 --> 3595.54]  His plan
[3595.54 --> 3596.22]  for you
[3596.22 --> 3597.40]  and for the world.
[3598.24 --> 3599.12]  In fact,
[3599.62 --> 3600.22]  what I hope
[3600.22 --> 3600.92]  we might have seen
[3600.92 --> 3601.56]  in this journey
[3601.56 --> 3602.28]  in the Psalms
[3602.28 --> 3604.42]  is that all of our suffering
[3604.42 --> 3605.84]  invites us
[3605.84 --> 3606.84]  to struggle
[3606.84 --> 3609.02]  with God.
[3610.22 --> 3611.66]  And it's in struggling
[3611.66 --> 3612.74]  with God,
[3612.84 --> 3613.68]  like Jacob
[3613.68 --> 3614.90]  who wrestled with Him,
[3615.18 --> 3615.34]  right,
[3615.40 --> 3616.12]  it's in struggling
[3616.12 --> 3616.86]  with God
[3616.86 --> 3618.48]  that we get close enough
[3618.48 --> 3620.66]  to see His face.
[3623.22 --> 3623.38]  Now,
[3623.44 --> 3623.82]  suffering
[3623.82 --> 3625.98]  also helps us see
[3625.98 --> 3627.40]  how the things
[3627.40 --> 3628.14]  that we have
[3628.14 --> 3629.96]  substituted for God
[3629.96 --> 3631.52]  aren't God
[3631.52 --> 3631.94]  and that
[3631.94 --> 3632.80]  those things
[3632.80 --> 3633.86]  don't and won't
[3633.86 --> 3634.98]  and can't fill
[3634.98 --> 3635.82]  the longing
[3635.82 --> 3637.72]  and the hole
[3637.72 --> 3639.02]  that only God can fill.
[3639.74 --> 3640.92]  That this is that mystery
[3640.92 --> 3642.00]  of the paradox
[3642.00 --> 3642.78]  continued,
[3643.78 --> 3643.92]  right,
[3644.00 --> 3645.20]  that God uses
[3645.20 --> 3646.62]  our darker emotions,
[3647.08 --> 3648.80]  He uses our experiences
[3648.80 --> 3649.80]  of His silence
[3649.80 --> 3650.96]  and His abandonment
[3650.96 --> 3652.18]  of struggle
[3652.18 --> 3653.74]  to win
[3653.74 --> 3655.50]  our hearts
[3655.50 --> 3657.80]  for His glory.
[3661.20 --> 3662.86]  Let me put it this way.
[3663.86 --> 3668.56]  the only way
[3668.56 --> 3670.96]  for any
[3670.96 --> 3672.76]  of our suffering
[3672.76 --> 3674.22]  and struggling
[3674.22 --> 3675.72]  to have meaning,
[3676.38 --> 3677.30]  the only way
[3677.30 --> 3678.22]  for any of it
[3678.22 --> 3678.86]  to have meaning
[3678.86 --> 3680.34]  is if God
[3680.34 --> 3681.04]  is sovereign
[3681.04 --> 3682.52]  over everything.
[3683.90 --> 3685.48]  Because if He's not,
[3686.04 --> 3687.60]  there's always a chance
[3687.60 --> 3689.12]  that what you face,
[3689.30 --> 3689.96]  what you suffer,
[3690.08 --> 3690.80]  what you struggle
[3690.80 --> 3692.32]  is meaningless.
[3692.32 --> 3694.82]  And we can never know.
[3696.60 --> 3698.02]  But it's not meaningless.
[3699.38 --> 3699.48]  Right?
[3699.72 --> 3700.60]  God fills
[3700.60 --> 3702.46]  everything you do
[3702.46 --> 3703.60]  and everything
[3703.60 --> 3704.40]  that happens
[3704.40 --> 3704.94]  to you
[3704.94 --> 3705.48]  with
[3705.48 --> 3706.60]  not just
[3706.60 --> 3707.76]  an immediate purpose
[3707.76 --> 3709.10]  but an eternal
[3709.10 --> 3710.16]  purpose.
[3712.08 --> 3712.80]  Maybe it's
[3712.80 --> 3713.24]  cliche
[3713.24 --> 3714.30]  for some of you
[3714.30 --> 3714.72]  but that doesn't
[3714.72 --> 3715.72]  make it any less true.
[3716.12 --> 3717.38]  Jeremiah 29, 11
[3717.38 --> 3717.82]  says,
[3718.22 --> 3719.18]  I know the plans
[3719.18 --> 3720.10]  I have for you,
[3720.36 --> 3721.04]  declares the Lord.
[3721.04 --> 3723.30]  That means that God
[3723.30 --> 3724.80]  has plans for you.
[3724.90 --> 3725.94]  He has a purpose
[3725.94 --> 3726.96]  for you.
[3727.72 --> 3729.10]  In 1 Corinthians 15,
[3729.46 --> 3730.24]  Paul says,
[3730.48 --> 3731.66]  your labor in the Lord
[3731.66 --> 3732.64]  is not in vain.
[3733.30 --> 3733.42]  Right?
[3733.44 --> 3734.62]  That means what you do
[3734.62 --> 3735.80]  has purpose.
[3736.26 --> 3737.14]  That what you do
[3737.14 --> 3738.22]  has meaning.
[3740.50 --> 3741.52]  And this next one
[3741.52 --> 3742.94]  is one of my favorite
[3742.94 --> 3743.92]  verses in all
[3743.92 --> 3744.94]  of Scripture.
[3745.24 --> 3746.08]  And I'm going to
[3746.08 --> 3747.12]  read it to you,
[3747.20 --> 3747.84]  share it with you
[3747.84 --> 3749.28]  from the ESV,
[3749.28 --> 3750.46]  English Standard Version
[3750.46 --> 3751.04]  translation.
[3751.84 --> 3752.18]  Normally,
[3752.68 --> 3753.82]  I and we here
[3753.82 --> 3755.04]  read from the NIV
[3755.04 --> 3756.12]  but I think that
[3756.12 --> 3757.32]  the way the ESV
[3757.32 --> 3758.24]  translates this
[3758.24 --> 3759.62]  section really
[3759.62 --> 3760.58]  just makes it sing
[3760.58 --> 3761.38]  and I want to
[3761.38 --> 3761.94]  share it with you
[3761.94 --> 3762.50]  in that language.
[3762.62 --> 3763.50]  But 2 Corinthians
[3763.50 --> 3765.96]  4, 17 and 18
[3765.96 --> 3766.44]  says,
[3766.44 --> 3790.96]  This is the perspective
[3790.96 --> 3792.10]  I want to take
[3792.10 --> 3793.60]  on my sufferings,
[3793.68 --> 3794.64]  on my afflictions,
[3794.74 --> 3795.80]  on my emotions
[3795.80 --> 3797.10]  that swirl around
[3797.10 --> 3797.96]  my struggling.
[3798.42 --> 3799.48]  And when I do,
[3799.78 --> 3801.06]  then I can say
[3801.06 --> 3801.90]  with Job,
[3802.08 --> 3803.46]  as he says in Job 13,
[3803.86 --> 3805.22]  though he slay me,
[3806.22 --> 3808.40]  I will hope in him.
[3809.88 --> 3811.34]  God is not surprised.
[3811.58 --> 3812.72]  He's not caught off guard.
[3813.24 --> 3814.10]  Nothing happens
[3814.10 --> 3814.90]  without his will
[3814.90 --> 3815.66]  to permit it
[3815.66 --> 3816.84]  or to bring it about.
[3816.84 --> 3821.56]  God is not
[3821.56 --> 3822.12]  in fact,
[3822.92 --> 3825.26]  this is exactly
[3825.26 --> 3826.52]  why
[3826.52 --> 3828.28]  when you are
[3828.28 --> 3829.60]  in deep despair,
[3830.16 --> 3831.84]  you can cry out
[3831.84 --> 3832.22]  to God.
[3833.42 --> 3834.54]  This is exactly
[3834.54 --> 3835.42]  why when you are
[3835.42 --> 3837.18]  raging with anger,
[3837.56 --> 3838.58]  you can contend
[3838.58 --> 3839.26]  with God.
[3839.82 --> 3840.58]  That's exactly
[3840.58 --> 3841.32]  why when you are
[3841.32 --> 3841.80]  afraid,
[3842.14 --> 3842.78]  you can run
[3842.78 --> 3843.20]  to God
[3843.20 --> 3844.08]  because he
[3844.08 --> 3845.06]  and he alone
[3845.06 --> 3846.22]  is the only one
[3846.22 --> 3847.08]  who can actually
[3847.08 --> 3847.98]  do something
[3847.98 --> 3849.18]  about whatever it is
[3849.18 --> 3850.02]  that you are facing
[3850.02 --> 3850.80]  and feeling.
[3853.88 --> 3854.48]  Look,
[3855.48 --> 3859.44]  God's sovereignty
[3859.44 --> 3861.32]  and his providence
[3861.32 --> 3862.60]  are exactly
[3862.60 --> 3863.42]  the reason
[3863.42 --> 3864.34]  why you can
[3864.34 --> 3865.32]  get angry
[3865.32 --> 3866.14]  at him
[3866.14 --> 3867.08]  when it doesn't
[3867.08 --> 3868.00]  make sense
[3868.00 --> 3868.52]  to you.
[3870.44 --> 3871.74]  But God,
[3872.00 --> 3873.30]  being God,
[3873.82 --> 3874.50]  his sovereignty
[3874.50 --> 3875.56]  and his providence
[3875.56 --> 3876.52]  also means
[3876.52 --> 3876.54]  also means
[3876.54 --> 3877.46]  that he has
[3877.46 --> 3878.20]  a purpose
[3878.20 --> 3879.30]  beyond your
[3879.30 --> 3880.08]  understanding,
[3880.26 --> 3881.38]  beyond your ability
[3881.38 --> 3882.26]  to see
[3882.26 --> 3883.90]  in whatever it is
[3883.90 --> 3884.58]  you are facing.
[3887.78 --> 3888.94]  And I get it.
[3890.28 --> 3892.28]  When your husband
[3892.28 --> 3892.80]  leaves
[3892.80 --> 3894.20]  or when your child
[3894.20 --> 3894.72]  dies,
[3894.84 --> 3895.98]  when you lose
[3895.98 --> 3896.52]  a job,
[3896.78 --> 3898.22]  I can't give you
[3898.22 --> 3899.38]  the reason for that.
[3900.40 --> 3901.20]  And I wish
[3901.20 --> 3901.80]  that I could,
[3902.80 --> 3903.72]  but it will never
[3903.72 --> 3904.20]  make sense
[3904.20 --> 3904.70]  to me either.
[3904.78 --> 3905.62]  I can't see it
[3905.62 --> 3906.18]  either.
[3906.44 --> 3907.30]  All I can do
[3907.30 --> 3908.40]  is cry with you
[3908.40 --> 3911.88]  and I do.
[3915.08 --> 3916.02]  And yet,
[3917.02 --> 3919.10]  and yet,
[3919.18 --> 3919.58]  no matter
[3919.58 --> 3921.94]  what you face,
[3922.20 --> 3923.32]  you can know
[3923.32 --> 3924.40]  that it is not
[3924.40 --> 3925.20]  meaningless.
[3926.30 --> 3927.34]  That it is producing
[3927.34 --> 3927.90]  in you
[3927.90 --> 3929.68]  a peculiar glory.
[3929.68 --> 3931.84]  So when your mom
[3931.84 --> 3932.16]  dies,
[3932.24 --> 3933.08]  don't look to
[3933.08 --> 3933.92]  things that are seen.
[3934.02 --> 3934.76]  Look to eternal
[3934.76 --> 3935.16]  things,
[3935.40 --> 3936.16]  the things of God.
[3936.26 --> 3937.20]  When you get cancer,
[3937.32 --> 3938.58]  it's not meaningless.
[3940.16 --> 3941.04]  God is doing
[3941.04 --> 3942.36]  something eternal
[3942.36 --> 3943.30]  in you.
[3943.56 --> 3944.48]  You can't see it.
[3944.54 --> 3945.42]  Of course you can't
[3945.42 --> 3945.86]  see it,
[3946.20 --> 3947.68]  but you can believe
[3947.68 --> 3948.68]  that he is.
[3949.40 --> 3950.48]  In your desperation
[3950.48 --> 3951.60]  and despair,
[3951.78 --> 3952.92]  God is developing
[3952.92 --> 3954.18]  and deepening
[3954.18 --> 3955.76]  a peculiar glory
[3955.76 --> 3956.36]  in you
[3956.36 --> 3957.76]  beyond compare
[3957.76 --> 3959.26]  to anything else.
[3961.16 --> 3961.64]  And sure,
[3961.90 --> 3963.88]  you can't see what,
[3964.88 --> 3966.02]  but you can know
[3966.02 --> 3966.82]  that.
[3967.72 --> 3968.60]  You don't know
[3968.60 --> 3969.90]  what he is doing.
[3970.06 --> 3970.72]  I don't know
[3970.72 --> 3971.92]  what he is doing,
[3972.02 --> 3972.56]  but I know
[3972.56 --> 3973.66]  that he is doing
[3973.66 --> 3974.48]  something
[3974.48 --> 3975.44]  and it's not
[3975.44 --> 3976.38]  a meaningless thing.
[3976.46 --> 3977.42]  It is an eternal
[3977.42 --> 3979.08]  glory thing.
[3981.62 --> 3983.02]  Allender and Longman
[3983.02 --> 3983.66]  in the book
[3983.66 --> 3984.40]  that we have been using,
[3984.92 --> 3985.66]  they say this.
[3986.44 --> 3986.64]  They say,
[3986.64 --> 3988.18]  part of the mystery
[3988.18 --> 3988.88]  of God
[3988.88 --> 3990.60]  is his disruptive
[3990.60 --> 3991.62]  intrusion
[3991.62 --> 3993.08]  to provide us
[3993.08 --> 3993.70]  with what we
[3993.70 --> 3995.58]  desperately desire,
[3995.92 --> 3997.08]  not what we think
[3997.08 --> 3998.04]  we require.
[3999.38 --> 4000.08]  He does so
[4000.08 --> 4000.72]  by use
[4000.72 --> 4002.60]  of a paradox.
[4003.84 --> 4004.92]  And you need to see this,
[4004.98 --> 4005.30]  which is why
[4005.30 --> 4005.90]  it's on the screen.
[4006.66 --> 4007.58]  He draws us
[4007.58 --> 4008.24]  to darkness
[4008.24 --> 4009.26]  and in the midst
[4009.26 --> 4010.04]  of what appears
[4010.04 --> 4010.68]  awful,
[4011.26 --> 4012.18]  he shows us
[4012.18 --> 4013.16]  something of his
[4013.16 --> 4013.74]  awe,
[4014.10 --> 4014.74]  full,
[4014.74 --> 4015.94]  bright
[4015.94 --> 4017.18]  goodness.
[4019.98 --> 4020.98]  You might not
[4020.98 --> 4022.62]  know it
[4022.62 --> 4023.78]  sitting here
[4023.78 --> 4024.44]  in the depths
[4024.44 --> 4025.56]  of heartache
[4025.56 --> 4026.64]  and pain,
[4026.80 --> 4026.94]  but
[4026.94 --> 4029.36]  what you desperately
[4029.36 --> 4030.24]  desire
[4030.24 --> 4031.88]  is God.
[4032.72 --> 4033.74]  You were made
[4033.74 --> 4035.18]  to glorify
[4035.18 --> 4035.98]  him
[4035.98 --> 4036.60]  and to find
[4036.60 --> 4037.34]  absolute
[4037.34 --> 4038.18]  and utter
[4038.18 --> 4039.20]  eternal
[4039.20 --> 4039.96]  joy
[4039.96 --> 4041.08]  in him.
[4041.08 --> 4042.06]  you were made
[4042.06 --> 4042.70]  for his
[4042.70 --> 4043.26]  praise
[4043.26 --> 4044.44]  and thanksgiving
[4044.44 --> 4046.00]  and everything,
[4046.44 --> 4047.04]  absolutely
[4047.04 --> 4048.66]  everything you do
[4048.66 --> 4049.70]  drives you
[4049.70 --> 4050.72]  towards him
[4050.72 --> 4052.48]  or away
[4052.48 --> 4052.94]  from him.
[4054.02 --> 4054.78]  Your life
[4054.78 --> 4055.46]  is either
[4055.46 --> 4056.60]  working out
[4056.60 --> 4058.30]  towards a glorifying
[4058.30 --> 4059.16]  of God
[4059.16 --> 4059.82]  and enjoying
[4059.82 --> 4060.52]  him forever
[4060.52 --> 4062.06]  or your heart
[4062.06 --> 4063.98]  is pursuing
[4063.98 --> 4064.76]  God
[4064.76 --> 4065.90]  or it's
[4065.90 --> 4066.54]  pursuing
[4066.54 --> 4068.38]  lesser glories
[4068.38 --> 4070.04]  or other
[4070.04 --> 4070.84]  substitutes.
[4071.96 --> 4072.88]  There is no
[4072.88 --> 4073.78]  middle ground
[4073.78 --> 4074.74]  in this.
[4074.84 --> 4075.26]  There is no
[4075.26 --> 4076.08]  neutral option.
[4076.24 --> 4076.76]  There is no
[4076.76 --> 4077.80]  third way.
[4077.88 --> 4078.32]  We get really
[4078.32 --> 4078.82]  good at trying
[4078.82 --> 4079.28]  to find
[4079.28 --> 4079.86]  and navigate
[4079.86 --> 4080.60]  a third way
[4080.60 --> 4081.08]  through this,
[4081.16 --> 4081.58]  but there really
[4081.58 --> 4082.64]  is only two.
[4083.04 --> 4083.82]  Either you are
[4083.82 --> 4084.70]  living and
[4084.70 --> 4085.56]  working and
[4085.56 --> 4087.22]  breathing towards
[4087.22 --> 4088.18]  God and with
[4088.18 --> 4089.12]  God or
[4089.12 --> 4090.54]  away from him
[4090.54 --> 4091.16]  and for
[4091.16 --> 4092.30]  something or
[4092.30 --> 4093.56]  someone else.
[4095.22 --> 4095.76]  And so take
[4095.76 --> 4096.80]  this truth back
[4096.80 --> 4097.64]  to our feelings.
[4098.38 --> 4098.82]  emotions.
[4099.34 --> 4099.48]  Right?
[4099.82 --> 4100.84]  The emotions
[4100.84 --> 4101.36]  that we've
[4101.36 --> 4102.14]  looked at in
[4102.14 --> 4102.66]  this series.
[4103.36 --> 4104.00]  That means
[4104.00 --> 4104.78]  that your
[4104.78 --> 4105.92]  anger will
[4105.92 --> 4106.62]  drive you
[4106.62 --> 4107.58]  towards God
[4107.58 --> 4109.30]  or away.
[4109.98 --> 4110.94]  Your fear
[4110.94 --> 4111.62]  will pull you
[4111.62 --> 4112.22]  into closer
[4112.22 --> 4112.82]  relationship
[4112.82 --> 4113.68]  with God
[4113.68 --> 4115.24]  or you will
[4115.24 --> 4115.58]  push him
[4115.58 --> 4115.84]  away.
[4116.96 --> 4117.70]  And it's the
[4117.70 --> 4118.10]  same thing
[4118.10 --> 4118.42]  with our
[4118.42 --> 4118.92]  anxiety,
[4119.24 --> 4119.50]  with our
[4119.50 --> 4119.88]  shame,
[4120.02 --> 4120.74]  with despair,
[4120.92 --> 4121.48]  with whatever
[4121.48 --> 4122.04]  it is that
[4122.04 --> 4122.66]  we are
[4122.66 --> 4123.32]  experiencing.
[4123.32 --> 4124.04]  Right?
[4126.04 --> 4127.26]  God doesn't
[4127.26 --> 4128.38]  just use
[4128.38 --> 4129.38]  our anxiety
[4129.38 --> 4129.98]  or our
[4129.98 --> 4130.54]  fear or
[4130.54 --> 4131.34]  our desperation.
[4132.10 --> 4133.22]  God reveals
[4133.22 --> 4134.84]  himself through
[4134.84 --> 4135.14]  them.
[4136.44 --> 4136.54]  Right?
[4136.62 --> 4137.98]  God meets us
[4137.98 --> 4139.38]  with loneliness.
[4139.70 --> 4140.24]  Wrap your mind
[4140.24 --> 4140.98]  around that for a
[4140.98 --> 4141.06]  minute.
[4141.16 --> 4141.26]  Right?
[4141.52 --> 4142.76]  It's not just
[4142.76 --> 4143.98]  in our loneliness.
[4144.36 --> 4145.26]  He meets us
[4145.26 --> 4147.16]  with our
[4147.16 --> 4147.56]  loneliness.
[4148.20 --> 4148.86]  He meets you
[4148.86 --> 4150.06]  with silence.
[4150.18 --> 4150.78]  He reveals
[4150.78 --> 4151.80]  himself through
[4151.80 --> 4152.62]  struggle.
[4152.62 --> 4153.28]  in our
[4153.28 --> 4153.76]  suffering.
[4154.10 --> 4154.98]  He reveals
[4154.98 --> 4156.14]  his goodness.
[4156.42 --> 4157.46]  His absolute,
[4157.96 --> 4158.28]  utter,
[4158.92 --> 4160.28]  eternal goodness.
[4160.82 --> 4161.54]  The darkness
[4161.54 --> 4162.44]  of the valley
[4162.44 --> 4163.14]  of the shadow
[4163.14 --> 4163.90]  of death
[4163.90 --> 4164.80]  makes the
[4164.80 --> 4165.36]  intensity
[4165.36 --> 4166.60]  of his glory
[4166.60 --> 4167.56]  and of his
[4167.56 --> 4168.54]  love shine
[4168.54 --> 4169.98]  with even
[4169.98 --> 4170.86]  greater
[4170.86 --> 4171.74]  lumosity,
[4172.10 --> 4172.82]  even greater
[4172.82 --> 4173.50]  brightness.
[4173.76 --> 4174.46]  The reality
[4174.46 --> 4175.24]  of who God
[4175.24 --> 4176.06]  is shines
[4176.06 --> 4177.10]  brightest
[4177.10 --> 4178.44]  against the
[4178.44 --> 4178.82]  darkness
[4178.82 --> 4180.48]  that we feel
[4180.48 --> 4181.74]  and live in.
[4181.74 --> 4184.94]  there is no
[4184.94 --> 4185.60]  resurrection
[4185.60 --> 4186.76]  without
[4186.76 --> 4187.60]  crucifixion.
[4188.88 --> 4189.66]  There is no
[4189.66 --> 4190.16]  glory
[4190.16 --> 4192.10]  without suffering.
[4194.38 --> 4194.60]  And so,
[4194.98 --> 4195.26]  again,
[4195.46 --> 4196.10]  frame that.
[4196.22 --> 4196.80]  Think about
[4196.80 --> 4197.32]  where we've
[4197.32 --> 4198.04]  been in this
[4198.04 --> 4198.34]  series.
[4198.48 --> 4198.66]  And I'm
[4198.66 --> 4198.88]  going to do
[4198.88 --> 4199.58]  a super
[4199.58 --> 4200.62]  quick recap
[4200.62 --> 4201.00]  here.
[4201.46 --> 4202.12]  Looking at
[4202.12 --> 4202.56]  the Psalms
[4202.56 --> 4202.90]  that we've
[4202.90 --> 4203.30]  looked at.
[4204.02 --> 4204.38]  We'll see
[4204.38 --> 4204.74]  them on the
[4204.74 --> 4204.96]  screen.
[4205.58 --> 4206.18]  Out of the
[4206.18 --> 4207.04]  depths I cry
[4207.04 --> 4207.46]  to you,
[4207.58 --> 4207.78]  Lord.
[4208.04 --> 4208.56]  Lord,
[4208.74 --> 4209.70]  hear my
[4209.70 --> 4210.18]  voice.
[4210.18 --> 4211.84]  Will you
[4211.84 --> 4212.46]  reject me
[4212.46 --> 4212.90]  forever?
[4213.30 --> 4213.62]  Will he
[4213.62 --> 4214.30]  never show
[4214.30 --> 4214.88]  his favor
[4214.88 --> 4215.28]  again?
[4215.96 --> 4216.62]  How long
[4216.62 --> 4217.00]  must I
[4217.00 --> 4217.52]  wrestle with
[4217.52 --> 4218.12]  my thoughts
[4218.12 --> 4218.56]  and day
[4218.56 --> 4219.12]  after day
[4219.12 --> 4219.76]  have sorrow
[4219.76 --> 4220.44]  in my
[4220.44 --> 4220.78]  heart?
[4221.26 --> 4221.78]  When you
[4221.78 --> 4222.30]  hid your
[4222.30 --> 4222.78]  face,
[4222.90 --> 4223.34]  I was
[4223.34 --> 4224.18]  dismayed.
[4224.38 --> 4224.76]  I have
[4224.76 --> 4225.40]  borne your
[4225.40 --> 4225.86]  terrors
[4225.86 --> 4226.44]  and in
[4226.44 --> 4228.30]  despair.
[4228.98 --> 4229.32]  Darkness
[4229.32 --> 4230.26]  is my
[4230.26 --> 4231.44]  closest friend.
[4231.56 --> 4232.02]  I live
[4232.02 --> 4232.70]  in disgrace
[4232.70 --> 4233.34]  all day
[4233.34 --> 4233.82]  long and
[4233.82 --> 4234.40]  my face
[4234.40 --> 4235.26]  is covered
[4235.26 --> 4236.20]  with shame.
[4237.14 --> 4237.70]  All of
[4237.70 --> 4238.12]  these are
[4238.12 --> 4238.62]  the true
[4238.62 --> 4239.30]  voice of
[4239.30 --> 4239.50]  our
[4239.50 --> 4239.96]  feelings
[4239.96 --> 4240.30]  and the
[4240.30 --> 4240.62]  cries
[4240.62 --> 4241.00]  of our
[4241.00 --> 4241.28]  faith.
[4241.66 --> 4241.80]  And in
[4241.80 --> 4242.14]  the midst
[4242.14 --> 4242.52]  of the
[4242.52 --> 4242.94]  Psalter,
[4243.68 --> 4243.98]  in the
[4243.98 --> 4244.38]  midst of
[4244.38 --> 4245.18]  God's
[4245.18 --> 4245.80]  book of
[4245.80 --> 4246.00]  his
[4246.00 --> 4246.64]  revelation
[4246.64 --> 4247.28]  to himself,
[4247.64 --> 4248.22]  God gives
[4248.22 --> 4248.68]  us a
[4248.68 --> 4249.32]  divinely
[4249.32 --> 4250.22]  authored
[4250.22 --> 4250.92]  expression
[4250.92 --> 4251.64]  of whatever
[4251.64 --> 4252.22]  emotion
[4252.22 --> 4253.08]  you find
[4253.08 --> 4253.82]  yourself in
[4253.82 --> 4254.30]  and an
[4254.30 --> 4254.90]  experience
[4254.90 --> 4255.90]  of whatever
[4255.90 --> 4257.00]  emotion
[4257.00 --> 4257.72]  that may
[4257.72 --> 4258.78]  be is
[4258.78 --> 4259.60]  used by
[4259.60 --> 4260.24]  God as
[4260.24 --> 4261.16]  a revelation
[4261.16 --> 4262.78]  of himself.
[4262.96 --> 4263.46]  He uses
[4263.46 --> 4264.36]  these to
[4264.36 --> 4265.36]  reveal the
[4265.36 --> 4266.00]  truth of
[4266.00 --> 4266.46]  who he
[4266.46 --> 4267.02]  is and
[4267.02 --> 4267.96]  the truth
[4267.96 --> 4268.60]  that is
[4268.60 --> 4269.32]  revealed to
[4269.32 --> 4269.82]  us is
[4269.82 --> 4270.40]  the truth
[4270.40 --> 4270.86]  of
[4270.86 --> 4271.34]  scripture
[4271.34 --> 4271.84]  and it
[4271.84 --> 4272.14]  becomes
[4272.14 --> 4273.04]  real in
[4273.04 --> 4273.18]  our
[4273.18 --> 4274.08]  experience
[4274.08 --> 4274.84]  together.
[4275.96 --> 4276.16]  God
[4276.16 --> 4276.86]  comes to
[4276.86 --> 4277.38]  you
[4277.38 --> 4279.84]  when you
[4279.84 --> 4280.22]  can't
[4280.22 --> 4280.86]  handle it
[4280.86 --> 4282.26]  but he
[4282.26 --> 4282.56]  can.
[4284.14 --> 4284.74]  He wants
[4284.74 --> 4285.22]  you to
[4285.22 --> 4286.04]  turn to
[4286.04 --> 4286.50]  him and
[4286.50 --> 4286.86]  in fact
[4286.86 --> 4287.92]  turning to
[4287.92 --> 4289.04]  him is
[4289.04 --> 4289.58]  what you
[4289.58 --> 4290.58]  are desperate
[4290.58 --> 4291.02]  for.
[4291.12 --> 4291.36]  It's what
[4291.36 --> 4291.62]  you are
[4291.62 --> 4292.52]  created for
[4292.52 --> 4293.16]  and so
[4293.16 --> 4293.74]  maybe you
[4293.74 --> 4294.06]  are in
[4294.06 --> 4294.58]  the depths
[4294.58 --> 4295.44]  right now,
[4295.52 --> 4295.98]  the pit of
[4295.98 --> 4296.32]  despair,
[4296.32 --> 4297.04]  the blackness
[4297.04 --> 4297.62]  of the grave,
[4297.72 --> 4298.26]  the chaos
[4298.26 --> 4298.78]  of Sheol.
[4299.04 --> 4299.46]  Maybe you
[4299.46 --> 4300.24]  feel abandoned
[4300.24 --> 4301.20]  or alone,
[4301.32 --> 4301.60]  maybe you
[4301.60 --> 4302.06]  feel covered
[4302.06 --> 4302.66]  in shame
[4302.66 --> 4303.30]  or wrapped
[4303.30 --> 4303.78]  in fear,
[4303.90 --> 4304.58]  maybe you
[4304.58 --> 4305.40]  are seething
[4305.40 --> 4306.12]  and overcome
[4306.12 --> 4307.18]  by anger
[4307.18 --> 4308.22]  and if that's
[4308.22 --> 4308.52]  you,
[4309.46 --> 4309.80]  welcome.
[4311.84 --> 4312.78]  Welcome to
[4312.78 --> 4313.28]  the family
[4313.28 --> 4313.72]  of God,
[4313.84 --> 4314.58]  welcome to
[4314.58 --> 4314.96]  the church
[4314.96 --> 4315.20]  of his
[4315.20 --> 4315.54]  people.
[4315.88 --> 4316.20]  You are
[4316.20 --> 4316.62]  in good
[4316.62 --> 4317.12]  company
[4317.12 --> 4318.32]  because that's
[4318.32 --> 4318.68]  me.
[4320.20 --> 4320.90]  On my best
[4320.90 --> 4321.48]  days,
[4321.78 --> 4322.28]  it doesn't
[4322.28 --> 4322.82]  look like
[4322.82 --> 4323.10]  that,
[4324.10 --> 4325.58]  but it
[4325.58 --> 4326.00]  is.
[4327.04 --> 4327.66]  You are
[4327.66 --> 4328.48]  welcome
[4328.48 --> 4329.18]  here.
[4329.30 --> 4329.68]  You are
[4329.68 --> 4330.08]  in the
[4330.08 --> 4330.56]  company of
[4330.56 --> 4331.04]  others who
[4331.04 --> 4331.86]  feel and
[4331.86 --> 4332.68]  experience the
[4332.68 --> 4333.12]  same thing
[4333.12 --> 4333.60]  and the
[4333.60 --> 4334.08]  truth is
[4334.08 --> 4334.86]  knowing that
[4334.86 --> 4335.50]  we don't
[4335.50 --> 4335.88]  have to
[4335.88 --> 4336.64]  wear masks,
[4337.02 --> 4337.44]  knowing that
[4337.44 --> 4337.72]  we don't
[4337.72 --> 4338.02]  have to
[4338.02 --> 4338.42]  pretend,
[4338.72 --> 4339.00]  we don't
[4339.00 --> 4339.24]  have to
[4339.24 --> 4339.64]  look like
[4339.64 --> 4339.90]  we have
[4339.90 --> 4340.12]  it all
[4340.12 --> 4340.76]  put together.
[4342.98 --> 4343.68]  But this
[4343.68 --> 4344.12]  morning,
[4344.50 --> 4346.44]  this morning
[4346.44 --> 4346.96]  hear the
[4346.96 --> 4347.54]  good news
[4347.54 --> 4350.50]  is that
[4350.50 --> 4352.46]  that truth
[4352.46 --> 4353.04]  of being
[4353.04 --> 4354.24]  welcomed into
[4354.24 --> 4354.78]  the presence
[4354.78 --> 4355.46]  of God
[4355.46 --> 4356.20]  in the
[4356.20 --> 4356.58]  midst of
[4356.58 --> 4357.28]  our despair,
[4357.64 --> 4357.92]  that the
[4357.92 --> 4358.40]  truth of
[4358.40 --> 4359.00]  being welcomed
[4359.00 --> 4359.50]  into the
[4359.50 --> 4359.96]  presence of
[4359.96 --> 4360.54]  God through
[4360.54 --> 4361.58]  our shame,
[4361.72 --> 4362.42]  that God
[4362.42 --> 4363.36]  reveals himself
[4363.36 --> 4364.60]  to us in
[4364.60 --> 4365.72]  our suffering,
[4366.10 --> 4366.64]  that truth
[4366.64 --> 4367.94]  is not the
[4367.94 --> 4369.02]  end of the
[4369.02 --> 4369.46]  story.
[4369.78 --> 4370.46]  Your desperation
[4370.46 --> 4371.48]  is not the
[4371.48 --> 4372.14]  end and so
[4372.14 --> 4373.14]  please don't
[4373.14 --> 4373.84]  let it be an
[4373.84 --> 4374.06]  end.
[4374.18 --> 4374.70]  Your loneliness
[4374.70 --> 4375.48]  is not the
[4375.48 --> 4375.68]  end.
[4375.94 --> 4376.90]  There is more
[4376.90 --> 4377.76]  for you
[4377.76 --> 4378.78]  and for us.
[4379.42 --> 4380.10]  I don't know
[4380.10 --> 4381.32]  exactly what
[4381.32 --> 4381.70]  it's going to
[4381.70 --> 4382.28]  take to get
[4382.28 --> 4382.64]  there,
[4383.36 --> 4384.04]  but I do
[4384.04 --> 4384.36]  know where
[4384.36 --> 4384.96]  there is.
[4390.24 --> 4391.06]  Shout for
[4391.06 --> 4391.86]  joy to
[4391.86 --> 4392.44]  the Lord
[4392.44 --> 4393.96]  all the
[4393.96 --> 4394.32]  earth.
[4395.38 --> 4395.70]  Worship
[4395.70 --> 4396.50]  the Lord
[4396.50 --> 4397.82]  with gladness.
[4398.00 --> 4398.86]  Come before
[4398.86 --> 4399.92]  him with
[4399.92 --> 4401.74]  joyful songs.
[4402.64 --> 4403.44]  The end
[4403.44 --> 4404.24]  of history
[4404.24 --> 4406.06]  is that
[4406.06 --> 4407.12]  reality.
[4409.08 --> 4409.96]  The end
[4409.96 --> 4410.64]  of history
[4410.64 --> 4411.68]  is all
[4411.68 --> 4412.48]  creation
[4412.48 --> 4414.08]  shouting for
[4414.08 --> 4414.98]  joy to
[4414.98 --> 4415.34]  the Lord.
[4415.44 --> 4415.86]  All of
[4415.86 --> 4416.74]  this chaos,
[4416.96 --> 4417.44]  the wars,
[4417.60 --> 4418.00]  the death,
[4418.18 --> 4418.62]  the famine,
[4418.74 --> 4419.26]  the dying,
[4419.62 --> 4420.22]  all of this
[4420.22 --> 4420.94]  heartbreak,
[4421.34 --> 4422.70]  the births and
[4422.70 --> 4423.34]  the celebrations
[4423.34 --> 4424.28]  and the triumphs
[4424.28 --> 4425.08]  and the rejoicing,
[4425.34 --> 4426.46]  all of this,
[4426.90 --> 4428.16]  gathering up
[4428.16 --> 4429.00]  everything that
[4429.00 --> 4429.80]  is, all of
[4429.80 --> 4431.18]  it culminates
[4431.18 --> 4432.18]  in everything
[4432.18 --> 4432.74]  that has
[4432.74 --> 4433.14]  breath,
[4433.14 --> 4434.86]  praising God.
[4436.36 --> 4437.10]  Know that
[4437.10 --> 4437.64]  the Lord
[4437.64 --> 4439.00]  is God.
[4439.00 --> 4439.64]  It is
[4439.64 --> 4440.28]  he who
[4440.28 --> 4441.02]  made us
[4441.02 --> 4441.64]  and we
[4441.64 --> 4443.18]  are his.
[4443.38 --> 4444.32]  We are
[4444.32 --> 4445.34]  his people,
[4445.54 --> 4446.10]  the sheep
[4446.10 --> 4447.52]  of his pasture.
[4448.70 --> 4449.52]  Know that
[4449.52 --> 4450.06]  the Lord
[4450.06 --> 4450.94]  is God.
[4451.06 --> 4451.42]  Accept
[4451.42 --> 4452.56]  no substitute.
[4452.88 --> 4453.08]  Settle
[4453.08 --> 4453.54]  for no
[4453.54 --> 4454.60]  lesser glories.
[4454.78 --> 4455.20]  Know that
[4455.20 --> 4455.64]  the Lord
[4455.64 --> 4456.56]  is God.
[4456.64 --> 4456.86]  It is
[4456.86 --> 4457.44]  he who
[4457.44 --> 4458.12]  made us
[4458.12 --> 4458.60]  and we
[4458.60 --> 4459.08]  are his.
[4459.26 --> 4459.88]  We are
[4459.88 --> 4460.48]  his people,
[4460.58 --> 4461.00]  the sheep
[4461.00 --> 4462.06]  of his pasture.
[4462.90 --> 4463.60]  All the earth
[4463.60 --> 4464.04]  is called
[4464.04 --> 4464.76]  to worship him
[4464.76 --> 4465.56]  and that's true.
[4465.82 --> 4466.32]  All the earth
[4466.32 --> 4466.94]  one day
[4466.94 --> 4467.98]  will worship him.
[4468.06 --> 4468.58]  Every knee
[4468.58 --> 4469.02]  will bow
[4469.02 --> 4469.66]  and every tongue
[4469.66 --> 4470.32]  confess that
[4470.32 --> 4471.04]  Jesus Christ
[4471.04 --> 4471.88]  is Lord
[4471.88 --> 4472.58]  to the glory
[4472.58 --> 4473.48]  of God the Father.
[4473.92 --> 4474.36]  One day,
[4474.46 --> 4474.84]  whether you
[4474.84 --> 4475.56]  believe this
[4475.56 --> 4476.12]  in life
[4476.12 --> 4477.42]  now or not,
[4477.68 --> 4478.34]  you will
[4478.34 --> 4479.08]  bow down
[4479.08 --> 4479.72]  in worship.
[4480.14 --> 4480.64]  The question
[4480.64 --> 4481.12]  is,
[4481.34 --> 4482.14]  will your worship
[4482.14 --> 4483.30]  be a consequence
[4483.30 --> 4484.14]  of judgment
[4484.14 --> 4485.08]  or will your
[4485.08 --> 4485.88]  worship be
[4485.88 --> 4486.60]  the reality
[4486.60 --> 4487.78]  of a redeemed
[4487.78 --> 4488.36]  life
[4488.36 --> 4489.22]  that knows
[4489.22 --> 4489.70]  Jesus?
[4491.00 --> 4492.66]  To be the
[4492.66 --> 4493.58]  people of God,
[4493.74 --> 4495.04]  to be a sheep
[4495.04 --> 4496.42]  of his pasture
[4496.42 --> 4497.24]  is to be
[4497.24 --> 4498.82]  his chosen people,
[4498.94 --> 4500.16]  his royal priesthood,
[4500.22 --> 4501.70]  his special possession.
[4502.04 --> 4502.86]  It is to be
[4502.86 --> 4503.42]  the people
[4503.42 --> 4504.26]  of whom God
[4504.26 --> 4504.60]  says,
[4504.78 --> 4506.06]  I am your God,
[4506.36 --> 4507.80]  you are my people.
[4507.90 --> 4508.44]  It is to be
[4508.44 --> 4509.62]  the lavishly loved
[4509.62 --> 4510.96]  son or daughter
[4510.96 --> 4512.08]  of the Father
[4512.08 --> 4513.18]  who calls us
[4513.18 --> 4513.86]  by name.
[4513.96 --> 4514.50]  It is to be
[4514.50 --> 4515.14]  the child
[4515.14 --> 4515.84]  to whom
[4515.84 --> 4516.36]  the Father
[4516.36 --> 4517.06]  runs.
[4517.20 --> 4518.00]  It is to know
[4518.00 --> 4519.48]  in this life
[4519.48 --> 4520.38]  here and now,
[4520.38 --> 4521.42]  already now,
[4521.52 --> 4522.24]  that Jesus
[4522.24 --> 4523.16]  lived the life
[4523.16 --> 4523.96]  I should have lived
[4523.96 --> 4525.08]  and died the death
[4525.08 --> 4526.34]  that I deserved
[4526.34 --> 4527.42]  and that in living
[4527.42 --> 4528.30]  perfectly,
[4528.56 --> 4529.46]  he grants you
[4529.46 --> 4530.80]  his righteousness
[4530.80 --> 4532.00]  and in dying
[4532.00 --> 4532.56]  the death
[4532.56 --> 4533.68]  that you deserve,
[4533.78 --> 4534.46]  that I deserve,
[4534.84 --> 4536.36]  we hand on to
[4536.36 --> 4537.64]  him our sin
[4537.64 --> 4538.54]  that he who knew
[4538.54 --> 4539.08]  no sin
[4539.08 --> 4539.90]  became sin
[4539.90 --> 4540.42]  for us
[4540.42 --> 4540.94]  that we
[4540.94 --> 4541.66]  might become
[4541.66 --> 4542.36]  the righteousness
[4542.36 --> 4543.76]  of God.
[4544.38 --> 4545.56]  This same
[4545.56 --> 4546.20]  Jesus,
[4546.52 --> 4547.56]  though he suffered
[4547.56 --> 4548.50]  and died,
[4548.64 --> 4549.60]  rose victorious
[4549.60 --> 4550.82]  over sin
[4550.82 --> 4551.72]  and death.
[4551.84 --> 4552.56]  There is no
[4552.56 --> 4553.24]  resurrection
[4553.24 --> 4555.20]  without crucifixion,
[4556.20 --> 4558.00]  but there is
[4558.00 --> 4558.60]  resurrection.
[4560.04 --> 4560.76]  Amen?
[4560.76 --> 4560.92]  Amen?
[4562.20 --> 4563.26]  So whatever
[4563.26 --> 4564.20]  you're facing,
[4564.90 --> 4565.78]  it isn't the end
[4565.78 --> 4566.38]  of the story.
[4567.22 --> 4568.24]  Resurrection is.
[4569.84 --> 4570.50]  And so enter
[4570.50 --> 4571.30]  his gates
[4571.30 --> 4572.40]  with thanksgiving
[4572.40 --> 4573.40]  and his courts
[4573.40 --> 4574.08]  with praise.
[4574.08 --> 4575.62]  Give thanks to him
[4575.62 --> 4577.72]  and praise his name.
[4577.84 --> 4579.46]  The goal of redeemed
[4579.46 --> 4580.44]  humanity
[4580.44 --> 4581.42]  is praise
[4581.42 --> 4582.40]  and thanksgiving.
[4582.58 --> 4583.44]  The purpose
[4583.44 --> 4584.88]  of your life
[4584.88 --> 4586.00]  in Jesus Christ
[4586.00 --> 4587.36]  is to glorify God
[4587.36 --> 4588.72]  and enjoy him forever.
[4589.06 --> 4589.92]  And it might
[4589.92 --> 4591.50]  take a severe
[4591.50 --> 4592.12]  mercy
[4592.12 --> 4592.98]  to see
[4592.98 --> 4594.22]  that truth.
[4596.00 --> 4597.26]  But a severe
[4597.26 --> 4598.06]  mercy now
[4598.06 --> 4598.72]  is better
[4598.72 --> 4599.82]  than an eternal
[4599.82 --> 4600.28]  judgment
[4600.28 --> 4601.04]  then.
[4602.24 --> 4602.98]  The affliction
[4602.98 --> 4604.00]  you experience
[4604.00 --> 4604.50]  now
[4604.50 --> 4605.64]  is producing
[4605.64 --> 4606.46]  in you
[4606.46 --> 4607.34]  an eternal
[4607.34 --> 4608.12]  weight
[4608.12 --> 4609.02]  of glory
[4609.02 --> 4610.02]  that far
[4610.02 --> 4610.78]  outweighs
[4610.78 --> 4612.04]  whatever struggle
[4612.04 --> 4613.18]  we are in
[4613.18 --> 4613.76]  now.
[4613.88 --> 4614.34]  And so
[4614.34 --> 4616.22]  fix your eyes
[4616.22 --> 4617.14]  not on things
[4617.14 --> 4618.06]  that are seen,
[4618.44 --> 4619.08]  on things that
[4619.08 --> 4619.94]  make sense
[4619.94 --> 4621.28]  to your brain,
[4621.42 --> 4622.32]  but fix them
[4622.32 --> 4622.88]  on things
[4622.88 --> 4623.80]  that are unseen.
[4624.36 --> 4625.40]  Trust in the one
[4625.40 --> 4626.68]  who guides
[4626.68 --> 4627.40]  and holds
[4627.40 --> 4628.28]  all creation
[4628.28 --> 4628.70]  together.
[4628.92 --> 4630.36]  Fix your eyes
[4630.36 --> 4631.14]  on the Lord
[4631.14 --> 4632.12]  Jesus Christ,
[4632.26 --> 4632.74]  the author
[4632.74 --> 4633.82]  and perfecter
[4633.82 --> 4634.56]  of our faith.
[4634.70 --> 4635.56]  Fix your eyes
[4635.56 --> 4636.20]  on God
[4636.20 --> 4637.20]  and know
[4637.20 --> 4638.42]  that the Lord
[4638.42 --> 4640.36]  is good.
[4641.36 --> 4642.42]  His love
[4642.42 --> 4643.76]  endures
[4643.76 --> 4644.86]  forever.
[4645.82 --> 4647.04]  His faithfulness
[4647.04 --> 4647.88]  continues
[4647.88 --> 4648.88]  through all
[4648.88 --> 4649.44]  generations.
[4651.06 --> 4651.90]  And that's why
[4651.90 --> 4652.90]  on Sundays
[4652.90 --> 4653.60]  when we gather
[4653.60 --> 4654.12]  to worship
[4654.12 --> 4655.26]  we can sing
[4655.26 --> 4655.84]  as we're going to do
[4655.84 --> 4656.24]  in a moment
[4656.24 --> 4657.44]  how great that art.
[4657.44 --> 4660.24]  because maybe
[4660.24 --> 4661.46]  you can't
[4661.46 --> 4662.98]  feel that
[4662.98 --> 4663.44]  true
[4663.44 --> 4664.34]  right now
[4664.34 --> 4666.08]  but you sing it
[4666.08 --> 4667.22]  as a statement
[4667.22 --> 4667.74]  of faith
[4667.74 --> 4669.06]  longing for it
[4669.06 --> 4669.70]  to be true.
[4670.08 --> 4671.24]  As an aspiration
[4671.24 --> 4672.94]  for a reality
[4672.94 --> 4674.06]  of an experience
[4674.06 --> 4674.56]  of God
[4674.56 --> 4675.24]  and maybe
[4675.24 --> 4676.22]  you are in the place
[4676.22 --> 4676.96]  where that is
[4676.96 --> 4678.40]  completely and utterly
[4678.40 --> 4679.14]  true for you
[4679.14 --> 4679.60]  right now
[4679.60 --> 4680.94]  and so you sing
[4680.94 --> 4682.16]  with a boldness
[4682.16 --> 4683.76]  and a volume
[4683.76 --> 4685.02]  that gathers up
[4685.02 --> 4685.58]  those of us
[4685.58 --> 4686.06]  who can't.
[4686.06 --> 4688.20]  the Lord
[4688.20 --> 4689.86]  is good.
[4690.30 --> 4691.06]  His love
[4691.06 --> 4692.22]  endures forever.
[4692.40 --> 4693.32]  His faithfulness
[4693.32 --> 4693.90]  continues
[4693.90 --> 4694.44]  through all
[4694.44 --> 4695.00]  generations
[4695.00 --> 4697.28]  and so we sing
[4697.28 --> 4698.82]  how great
[4698.82 --> 4701.00]  thou art.
[4701.78 --> 4702.08]  Amen.
[4703.08 --> 4704.10]  Let's pray together.
[4712.10 --> 4712.90]  Holy,
[4713.40 --> 4714.54]  holy God.
[4716.06 --> 4717.02]  we stand
[4717.02 --> 4718.32]  in your presence
[4718.32 --> 4719.40]  amazed
[4719.40 --> 4721.04]  at who you are
[4721.04 --> 4722.14]  and at what you
[4722.14 --> 4722.74]  have done.
[4723.48 --> 4724.12]  Help us
[4724.12 --> 4725.06]  to trust
[4725.06 --> 4726.20]  in things
[4726.20 --> 4726.98]  that are not
[4726.98 --> 4727.76]  seen.
[4727.90 --> 4728.32]  Help us
[4728.32 --> 4729.06]  to trust
[4729.06 --> 4730.28]  in your
[4730.28 --> 4731.72]  faithfulness
[4731.72 --> 4732.66]  that continues
[4732.66 --> 4733.92]  through all
[4733.92 --> 4734.58]  generations.
[4735.12 --> 4735.62]  May we
[4735.62 --> 4736.98]  be a generation
[4736.98 --> 4738.40]  of faith.
[4739.40 --> 4739.90]  May we
[4739.90 --> 4740.42]  here
[4740.42 --> 4741.20]  and now
[4741.20 --> 4742.12]  know
[4742.12 --> 4743.40]  that you
[4743.40 --> 4744.18]  are
[4744.18 --> 4744.90]  God.
[4745.86 --> 4746.38]  That you
[4746.38 --> 4746.94]  have made
[4746.94 --> 4747.30]  us
[4747.30 --> 4747.98]  that we
[4747.98 --> 4748.92]  belong
[4748.92 --> 4749.88]  to you.
[4750.72 --> 4751.44]  That we
[4751.44 --> 4751.82]  are your
[4751.82 --> 4752.26]  people.
[4753.22 --> 4753.80]  The sheep
[4753.80 --> 4754.48]  of your
[4754.48 --> 4754.90]  pasture.
[4756.76 --> 4757.24]  And that because
[4757.24 --> 4757.58]  of your
[4757.58 --> 4758.34]  great love
[4758.34 --> 4759.06]  for us
[4759.06 --> 4759.76]  by grace
[4759.76 --> 4760.40]  through faith
[4760.40 --> 4761.08]  you will
[4761.08 --> 4762.42]  wander far
[4762.42 --> 4762.92]  afield
[4762.92 --> 4763.54]  leaving the

[4766.38 --> 4767.28]  who is
[4767.28 --> 4767.98]  away.

[4772.04 --> 4772.36]  first

[4773.46 --> 4774.44]  501st
[4774.44 --> 4774.86]  time
[4774.86 --> 4776.22]  find us

[4779.26 --> 4779.70]  statement
[4779.70 --> 4780.44]  of faith

[4781.04 --> 4781.28]  sure
[4781.28 --> 4781.84]  conviction
[4781.84 --> 4782.86]  how
[4782.86 --> 4783.86]  great
[4783.86 --> 4784.94]  thou
[4784.94 --> 4786.00]  art.
[4786.76 --> 4787.00]  Shout
[4787.00 --> 4787.82]  for joy
[4787.82 --> 4788.24]  to the

[4792.72 --> 4793.30]  with
[4793.30 --> 4793.88]  gladness.

[4796.00 --> 4796.60]  joyful
[4796.60 --> 4797.86]  song.

[4832.26 --> 4833.90]  my God
[4833.90 --> 4835.06]  when I

[4836.06 --> 4837.52]  wonder
[4837.52 --> 4839.48]  consider

[4840.76 --> 4841.56]  my
[4841.56 --> 4842.00]  words
[4842.00 --> 4842.42]  I
[4842.42 --> 4842.88]  have
[4842.88 --> 4843.38]  to
[4843.38 --> 4844.14]  see
[4844.14 --> 4845.70]  I
[4845.70 --> 4846.26]  see
[4846.26 --> 4846.70]  the
[4846.70 --> 4847.64]  star
[4847.64 --> 4848.36]  I
[4848.36 --> 4848.90]  hear
[4848.90 --> 4849.32]  the
[4849.32 --> 4850.08]  rolling
[4850.08 --> 4851.26]  thunder
[4851.26 --> 4852.72]  I
[4852.72 --> 4853.30]  love
[4853.30 --> 4855.26]  the
[4855.26 --> 4856.68]  universe
[4856.68 --> 4857.06]  to
[4857.06 --> 4857.94]  say
[4857.94 --> 4860.70]  me
[4860.70 --> 4861.32]  in
[4861.32 --> 4861.60]  sense
[4861.60 --> 4861.98]  my soul
[4861.98 --> 4862.20]  my
[4862.20 --> 4863.08]  saviour
[4863.08 --> 4863.72]  God
[4863.72 --> 4863.94]  to
[4863.94 --> 4864.82]  me
[4864.82 --> 4866.48]  how
[4866.48 --> 4866.88]  great
[4866.88 --> 4867.30]  thou
[4867.30 --> 4868.74]  art
[4868.74 --> 4869.78]  how
[4869.78 --> 4870.32]  great
[4870.32 --> 4870.78]  thou
[4870.78 --> 4872.26]  art
[4872.26 --> 4873.08]  in
[4873.08 --> 4873.60]  sense
[4873.60 --> 4875.10]  my soul
[4875.10 --> 4875.66]  my
[4875.66 --> 4876.54]  saviour
[4876.54 --> 4877.16]  God
[4877.16 --> 4877.42]  to
[4877.42 --> 4878.58]  me
[4878.58 --> 4879.84]  how
[4879.84 --> 4880.26]  great
[4880.26 --> 4880.76]  thou
[4880.76 --> 4882.32]  art
[4882.32 --> 4883.14]  how
[4883.14 --> 4883.56]  great
[4883.56 --> 4884.02]  thou
[4884.02 --> 4885.52]  art
[4885.52 --> 4895.36]  When through the woods and forest streets I wander
[4895.36 --> 4901.82]  I hear the birds sing sweetly in the sky
[4901.82 --> 4908.94]  When I look down, come walk me out in wonder
[4908.94 --> 4915.14]  Then hear the birds and hear the birds of the earth
[4915.14 --> 4922.76]  And sings my soul, my Savior God to me
[4922.76 --> 4928.90]  How great the world, how great the world
[4928.90 --> 4935.68]  Then sings my soul, my Savior God to me
[4935.68 --> 4942.42]  How great the world, how great the world
[4942.42 --> 4953.04]  But when I see that God his Son not sparing
[4953.04 --> 4959.80]  Sends him to die, I scarce can take it in
[4959.80 --> 4966.42]  That on the cross my burden gladly bearing
[4966.42 --> 4973.42]  He bled and died to take away my sin
[4973.42 --> 4981.04]  Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee
[4981.04 --> 4987.66]  How great thou art, how great thou art
[4987.66 --> 4993.66]  Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee
[4993.66 --> 5000.66]  How great thou art, how great thou art
[5000.66 --> 5011.28]  When Christ shall come, his shout of acclimation
[5011.28 --> 5018.28]  And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart
[5018.28 --> 5024.62]  Then I shall bow in a full adoration
[5024.62 --> 5032.24]  And there will be my heart, how great thou art
[5032.24 --> 5038.24]  Then sings my soul, my Savior God to me
[5038.24 --> 5044.24]  How great thou art, how great thou art
[5044.24 --> 5055.86]  How great thou art, how great thou art
[5055.86 --> 5073.70]  As you go into this week, as you come from here
[5073.70 --> 5078.18]  Experiencing and feeling whatever it is that you do
[5078.18 --> 5081.32]  And going to wherever it is that you go
[5081.32 --> 5085.74]  Know that God himself goes with you
[5085.74 --> 5090.36]  As you go, go also with an invitation
[5090.36 --> 5093.00]  To stick around in fellowship afterwards
[5093.00 --> 5094.04]  There's coffee
[5094.04 --> 5097.04]  I was reminded of an announcement that I didn't make
[5097.04 --> 5099.32]  There is also children's choir practice
[5099.32 --> 5102.48]  So if you are in the children's choir
[5102.48 --> 5103.94]  If your kids are in the children's choir
[5103.94 --> 5105.76]  They are meeting in the multi-purpose room
[5105.76 --> 5107.00]  Following service
[5107.00 --> 5109.10]  And there's 20-20 tonight
[5109.10 --> 5111.04]  So if you're a youth person

[5112.20 --> 5114.34]  Here at church beginning at 6-30
[5114.34 --> 5115.48]  If you have questions about that
[5115.48 --> 5116.80]  Pastor Kevin will answer them
[5116.80 --> 5120.52]  Go then in the power of the Spirit
[5120.52 --> 5122.74]  With the blessing of God
[5122.74 --> 5126.10]  May God go before you
[5126.10 --> 5128.06]  To prepare a way for you
[5128.06 --> 5130.68]  May God go behind you
[5130.68 --> 5131.88]  To protect you
[5131.88 --> 5134.48]  May God go beneath you
[5134.48 --> 5135.44]  To support you
[5135.44 --> 5137.96]  And may God go beside you
[5137.96 --> 5139.18]  To befriend you
[5139.18 --> 5141.22]  Do not be afraid
[5141.22 --> 5143.70]  Let the blessing of God come upon you today
[5143.70 --> 5145.38]  Do not be afraid
[5145.38 --> 5147.56]  But go in peace
[5147.56 --> 5150.80]  To love and serve the Lord
[5150.80 --> 5152.82]  Amen
